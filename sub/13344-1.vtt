WEBVTT

00:07.741 --> 00:09.777
( sniffling )

00:12.580 --> 00:15.749
( sobbing )

00:30.831 --> 00:33.801
( theme music playing )

00:53.020 --> 00:54.622
I TOLD YOU.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.424
TOLD ME WHAT?

00:56.524 --> 00:58.659
THAT YOU'D BE SORRY
YOU EVER ENCOURAGED ME
TO CRY HERE.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.329
I'M NOT SORRY AT ALL.

01:01.429 --> 01:04.765
YOU DIDN'T EXPECT IT
TO BE LIKE THIS, I BET.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.667
LIKE WHAT?

01:08.369 --> 01:11.004
( sighs )
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:11.105 --> 01:13.507
IT'S DISAPPOINTING.

01:13.607 --> 01:17.077
I THOUGHT I'D FEEL
BETTER, RELIEVED.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.547
I THOUGHT IT'D BE
A LOT MORE FUN.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.215
AND IT ISN'T?

01:21.315 --> 01:23.217
NO, IT'S HORRIBLE.

01:23.317 --> 01:27.921
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M ABLE TO TALK
TODAY, PAUL.

01:28.021 --> 01:30.724
I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.
I SHOULD HAVE JUST--

01:30.824 --> 01:33.361
I SHOULD HAVE
JUST CALLED IT OFF.
I'M SORRY.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.333
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- ( sighs )

01:39.433 --> 01:42.603
- YEAH.
- SIT DOWN. SIT.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.446
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
SITTING OUT IN THE PARK
FOR ABOUT FOUR HOURS.

01:53.281 --> 01:55.183
- OUT HERE?
- YEAH.

01:55.283 --> 01:58.252
I WANTED TO CALL IT OFF,
THE SESSION,

01:58.352 --> 01:59.853
BUT...
( sniffs )

01:59.953 --> 02:02.756
I WASN'T SURE
I'D BE ABLE TO MAKE IT
HOME ALONE.

02:04.392 --> 02:07.461
I TOOK A CAB HERE.
MY CAR'S AT HOME.

02:07.561 --> 02:11.299
OH GOD, AT LEAST
I THINK IT IS.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.438
YEAH YEAH,
MY CAR'S AT HOME.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.842
( sighs )
MY GOD, IT'S FREEZING.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.745
I CAME THIS CLOSE
TO KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR

02:24.845 --> 02:26.146
AND ASKING
FOR A SWEATER.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.948
- WHEN WAS THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.017
MAYBE 5:00 OR 6:00,
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.419
IT WAS STILL DARK.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.654
I WAITED FOR THE SUN
TO COME UP.

02:33.754 --> 02:37.625
I'VE NEVER WAITED THIS LONG
FOR A SUNRISE,

02:37.725 --> 02:40.894
EXCEPT MAYBE ON A CAMPING
TRIP IN FIFTH GRADE.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.899
THANK YOU.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.904
( sniffs )

02:51.004 --> 02:53.341
( sighs )

03:03.050 --> 03:05.953
- YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?
- WHAT?

03:06.053 --> 03:07.955
I HELD MY CELL PHONE

03:08.055 --> 03:11.659
AND I WATCHED
THE MINUTES GO BY.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.695
IT FELT LIKE FOREVER
FOR ONE MINUTE TO TURN
INTO THE NEXT.

03:14.795 --> 03:18.499
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
"HOW STUPID IS THIS,

03:18.599 --> 03:21.168
DYING ON THE STREET
LIKE ROADKILL

03:21.269 --> 03:23.504
OUTSIDE YOUR
THERAPIST'S OFFICE?"

03:29.142 --> 03:31.712
( sniffs )

03:36.216 --> 03:38.452
I'M SORRY, PAUL.
I--

03:38.552 --> 03:41.088
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED IT OFF.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.756
YOU SHOULD HAVE COME HERE.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.363
WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT?

03:51.965 --> 03:55.303
WELL, WHAT
DIDN'T HAPPEN?

03:57.405 --> 03:59.707
THE LONG VERSION
OR THE BOTTOM LINE?

03:59.807 --> 04:03.444
BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE
IS VERY SIMPLE--

04:04.978 --> 04:06.647
MY LIFE IS OVER.

04:06.747 --> 04:11.319
THEN YOU'D BETTER TELL ME
THE LONG VERSION.

04:20.193 --> 04:21.962
I LEFT ANDREW.

04:22.062 --> 04:25.132
WE HAD A BIG BLOWOUT--

04:25.232 --> 04:27.435
SCREAMING, CRYING--
THE WORKS.

04:28.569 --> 04:31.104
AND AT SOME POINT I, UH--
I CALLED ALONA

04:31.204 --> 04:34.408
AND WE WENT OUT
FOR A DRINK.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.244
WE HAD A FEW DRINKS.

04:37.345 --> 04:40.280
LISTEN, I'M NOT HERE.
I'M--

04:40.381 --> 04:42.249
I'M SO TOTALLY
NOT HERE.

04:42.350 --> 04:46.354
YOU ARE VERY MUCH HERE,
LAURA.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.824
NO, IT'S NOT ME
THAT'S HERE.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.362
BELIEVE ME,
YOU'D BE SHOCKED

04:54.462 --> 04:56.196
TO KNOW THE PERSON
THAT'S SITTING HERE.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.499
I DID SOME--

04:58.599 --> 05:01.602
I DID SOME
TERRIBLE THINGS
LAST NIGHT.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.905
( sighs )

05:05.005 --> 05:06.974
OH...

05:08.241 --> 05:10.277
( chuckles )

05:10.378 --> 05:12.746
I FEEL SICK.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.816
BUT I DON'T WANNA
THROW UP.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.918
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.753
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'S VOMIT.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.089
I'M NOT GONNA VOMIT
ALL OVER YOUR RUG.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.924
IT'S A CHEAP RUG, LAURA.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.863
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S
REALLY GOING ON HERE.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.768
HMM?

05:37.771 --> 05:41.642
- ( sighs )
- ( phone ringing )

05:51.151 --> 05:52.986
IT'S ANDREW.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.756
HE KNOWS
I'M HERE AT THIS TIME.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.925
- WHY IS HE
CALLING ME HERE?
- MAYBE HE'S WORRIED.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.260
- YOU WERE OUT OF
THE HOUSE ALL NIGHT.
- YEAH, RIGHT.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.096
IF HE REALLY CARED,
HE WOULDN'T HAVE STARTED
WITH HIS SHIT.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.433
START WHAT?

06:10.471 --> 06:13.874
AT THE CLUB,
THIS GUY--

06:15.976 --> 06:18.378
OH MY GOD--

06:22.550 --> 06:25.118
HE HAD
CORDUROY PANTS ON,

06:25.218 --> 06:27.154
PREPPY SWEATER--

06:28.388 --> 06:29.990
A REPUBLICAN, PROBABLY.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.992
( phone beeps )

06:34.695 --> 06:36.564
YOU KNOW WHAT?
CAN I JUST STEP OUT
FOR A SECOND

06:36.664 --> 06:38.298
AND LET HIM
KNOW I'M HERE?
I MEAN,

06:38.398 --> 06:40.200
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE
WITH THIS SHIT.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.035
JUST A SEC.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.538
LAURA,
THE CALL CAN WAIT.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.178
( sighs )

07:03.423 --> 07:06.760
ANDREW GAVE ME
AN ULTIMATUM:

07:06.860 --> 07:09.963
EITHER WE GET MARRIED
OR WE SPLIT.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.533
HE SAID HE WANTS
AN ANSWER IN A DAY
OR TWO AT THE MOST

07:12.633 --> 07:14.735
OR ELSE HE'S OUT.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.738
HE SAID HE CAN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE;

07:17.838 --> 07:20.373
THAT HE LOVES ME,
THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE
I LOVE HIM--

07:20.474 --> 07:22.676
NOT FOR REAL;

07:22.776 --> 07:25.245
THAT IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS
ALREADY ON AND OFF--

07:25.345 --> 07:27.615
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.583
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
ALL OF A SUDDEN

07:29.683 --> 07:32.252
HE JUST STARTED
RANTING AND RAVING.

07:32.352 --> 07:35.956
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT
THIS STUFF BEFORE.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.158
BUT IT WAS ALL IN THEORY,
IF WE STAYED TOGETHER--

07:38.258 --> 07:40.427
IF.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.530
AND SUDDENLY,
OUT OF THE BLUE, I--

07:42.630 --> 07:45.398
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT WE WERE DOING.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.668
WE WERE WATCHING TV.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.670
ALL OF A SUDDEN
HE JUST GETS OFF THE COUCH

07:49.770 --> 07:51.505
AND GRABS THE REMOTE
AND TURNS OFF THE TV

07:51.605 --> 07:53.641
AND HE TURNS TO ME
AND HE HAS TEARS
IN HIS EYES

07:53.741 --> 07:56.443
AND HE SAYS: "THAT'S IT.
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE."

07:56.544 --> 07:59.947
WOW!
SO OUT OF LINE.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.816
PROMISED HE'D LAY OFF
THE SUBJECT FOR AWHILE

08:02.916 --> 08:05.519
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
HE'S ON THIS CRYING BULLSHIT.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.454
HE ACTUALLY BURST OUT
CRYING.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.122
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

08:09.222 --> 08:12.325
AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
IT REALLY SCARED ME.

08:12.425 --> 08:15.362
- NO, IT MADE ME ANGRY.
- WHY?

08:15.462 --> 08:18.498
BECAUSE HE'S TRYING
TO MANIPULATE ME WITH THESE--
THESE CHEAP CHICK TRICKS.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.400
MAYBE HE THOUGHT

08:20.500 --> 08:23.604
HE WOULD BREAK MY HEART
OR SOMETHING,

08:23.704 --> 08:25.939
APPEAL TO MY--

08:26.039 --> 08:28.208
SHIT,
YOU KNOW, FORGET IT.
I DON'T KNOW.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.678
I THREW A TANTRUM

08:30.778 --> 08:32.445
LIKE A THREE-YEAR-OLD.

08:32.546 --> 08:35.716
SCREAMED, CRIED,

08:35.816 --> 08:38.085
TOLD HIM TO FUCK OFF.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.888
I TOLD HIM HE WAS
A LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT

08:40.988 --> 08:42.890
FOR DOING THIS TO ME
WHEN HE KNOWS

08:42.990 --> 08:45.959
THAT I'M WORKING DOUBLE SHIFTS
AT THE HOSPITAL THIS WEEK.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.762
I SLAMMED THE DOOR,

08:48.862 --> 08:51.865
SMASHED HIS LAPTOP
ON THE FLOOR.
I KILLED IT.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.501
I RAN OUT
AND I CALLED ALONA.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.237
SHE DRESSED ME
IN THIS OUTFIT.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.075
IT'S-- IT'S NOT MINE.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.746
WE WENT OUT
FOR A DRINK

09:05.846 --> 09:08.081
AT A CLUB
THAT SHE LIKES
ON CHESTER ST.

09:08.181 --> 09:12.052
OH, SHE TRIED
TO CALM ME DOWN,
PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.256
AND SHE SAID--

09:16.356 --> 09:19.126
SHE SAID I WAS LUCKY;

09:21.161 --> 09:25.065
THAT SHE WISHED SOMEBODY
LOVED HER ENOUGH TO GIVE HER
AN ULTIMATUM.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.638
AND THEN WE DRANK.

09:30.738 --> 09:34.608
WELL, I DRANK.

09:34.708 --> 09:38.111
AND, UH, THERE WAS
THIS GUY AT THE BAR

09:38.211 --> 09:40.580
AND AT SOME POINT ALONA
SAID THAT SHE WAS TIRED

09:40.681 --> 09:42.549
AND THAT SHE NEEDED
TO GO HOME.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.953
AND THEN THAT GUY...

09:46.053 --> 09:50.257
MOVED NEXT TO ME AND, UM,
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?

09:50.357 --> 09:52.626
HE SAID,

09:52.726 --> 09:55.595
"YOU LOOK SO SAD."

09:56.463 --> 09:57.965
AND I SAID, "REALLY?"

09:58.065 --> 10:02.235
AND HE SAID, "YEAH, YOU DO.
IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU."

10:04.237 --> 10:06.306
"LOOKS GOOD ON YOU."

10:06.406 --> 10:08.709
I MEAN, WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO "DO YOU HAVE THE TIME?"

10:08.809 --> 10:11.578
OR "HAVEN'T WE MET
BEFORE?" OR--

10:11.679 --> 10:13.947
I MUST BE TOTALLY
OUT OF TOUCH, PAUL.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.217
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I MEAN, DO I LOOK GOOD

10:17.317 --> 10:20.020
WHEN I'M SAD?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.822
I--

10:21.922 --> 10:24.825
I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY LOOKS GOOD
WHEN THEY'RE SAD.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.567
AND THEN, UH--

10:34.668 --> 10:36.704
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
I HAD TO DRINK

10:36.804 --> 10:38.571
'CAUSE HE WAS
ORDERING FOR ME,
OF COURSE.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.373
AND THEN HE, UH,
PAID THE BILL

10:40.473 --> 10:42.976
AND HE ASKED ME,
"WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE?"

10:43.076 --> 10:46.113
AND I SAID,
"YES, I'D LIKE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM."

10:46.213 --> 10:49.216
SO I STOOD UP
AND I WENT TO
THE BATHROOM.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.251
HE FOLLOWS ME.

10:51.351 --> 10:55.255
AND YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE IT, BUT THESE
WERE UNISEX BATHROOMS.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.524
AM I UNLUCKY OR WHAT?

10:57.624 --> 10:59.259
HOW DO YOU MEAN, UNLUCKY?

10:59.359 --> 11:01.995
WELL, I'M--
I'M RUNNING AWAY
FROM A GUY AND I'M--

11:02.095 --> 11:04.732
OH, YEAH, YOU WERE TRYING
TO GET AWAY FROM THE GUY.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.500
RIGHT. I MEAN,
I NEEDED TO PEE,
YOU KNOW, BY MYSELF.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.770
I'VE BEEN DOING THAT
SINCE I WAS THREE.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.476
SO I REALIZED
I NEEDED TO MAKE
A DECISION.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.045
BY FOLLOWING ME
TO THE BATHROOM

11:18.145 --> 11:21.114
THIS GUY WAS ALSO
GIVING ME AN ULTIMATUM.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.951
I THOUGHT,
"FUCK, OUT OF THE PAN
AND INTO THE FIRE."

11:24.051 --> 11:25.986
I RAN AWAY
FROM ONE ULTIMATUM

11:26.086 --> 11:29.222
AND THERE WAS
THIS GUY WITH A HARD-ON
GIVING ME ANOTHER.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.996
SUDDENLY I FELT
LIKE DOING IT.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.835
I NEVER HAD SEX
IN A BATHROOM BEFORE.

11:43.603 --> 11:47.174
I MEAN, WHAT?
I SHOULD GO AND MARRY ANDREW
WITHOUT EVER KNOWING

11:47.274 --> 11:50.744
WHAT A GOOD BATHROOM
FUCK'S ALL ABOUT?

11:50.844 --> 11:53.413
IT'S PART OF A YOUNG LADY'S
EDUCATION, ISN'T IT?

11:53.513 --> 11:58.285
SO YOU WANTED TO DO IT
BUT NOT TO GET BACK
AT ANDREW?

11:58.385 --> 12:00.120
JUST FOR YOURSELF?

12:00.220 --> 12:03.757
THAT'S RIGHT.

12:03.857 --> 12:07.327
A GIRL BEING FORCED
INTO MARRIAGE--

12:07.427 --> 12:09.997
WHAT'S SHE SUPPOSED TO DO,
DIE IGNORANT?

12:12.099 --> 12:16.403
SO THIS GUY FOLLOWS ME
INTO THE STALL

12:16.503 --> 12:19.372
AND SUDDENLY

12:19.472 --> 12:21.842
I WAS HORNY.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.813
IS HEARING ABOUT THIS
DISGUSTING TO YOU?

12:25.913 --> 12:29.082
NO, IT'S NOT DISGUSTING.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.018
GO ON.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.423
HE UNZIPPED,

12:36.523 --> 12:38.658
PULLED DOWN HIS PANTS

12:38.758 --> 12:43.763
AND HE STOOD THERE
WITH HIS HUGE--

12:46.666 --> 12:49.837
OH GOD, I FELT
LIKE I WAS 16...

12:52.940 --> 12:55.242
TOUCHING IT FOR
THE VERY FIRST TIME.

12:56.243 --> 13:00.147
I WAS REALLY SURPRISED
AT HOW...

13:00.247 --> 13:02.615
WARM IT FELT.

13:02.715 --> 13:06.453
I MEAN, DON'T I KNOW
THAT ALREADY?

13:06.553 --> 13:09.289
AND THEN
HE TURNED ME AROUND

13:09.389 --> 13:11.358
TO FACE THE DOOR...

13:12.625 --> 13:15.428
AND HE PULLED DOWN
MY STOCKINGS.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.900
HE LIFTED UP MY SKIRT,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.769
PUT HIS HAND
INTO HIS BACK POCKET
AND PULLED OUT A CONDOM.

13:22.870 --> 13:26.439
I REALIZE THIS GUY'S
VERY GOOD AT THIS.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.877
HE DOES THIS A LOT.
HE'S A-- HE'S A REAL PRO.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.914
AND THEN THIS GUY

13:34.014 --> 13:37.784
ENTERED THE STALL NEXT TO US
AND STARTED PEEING--

13:37.885 --> 13:41.054
IN GUSHES, FULL VOLUME
LIKE A RACEHORSE.

13:45.525 --> 13:50.130
I THOUGHT OF ANDREW,

13:50.230 --> 13:52.565
HOW-- HOW HE PEES
IN THE MORNING,

13:52.665 --> 13:55.235
MAKING THE SAME SOUND.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.872
MY HEART ACHED.
I JUST--

14:01.541 --> 14:04.344
IT WAS SO STUPID, YOU KNOW?
I JUST FELT

14:04.444 --> 14:06.513
SO SAD ALL OF A SUDDEN.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.949
AND HE'S BEHIND ME
AND HE'S RUBBING UP
AGAINST ME

14:09.049 --> 14:12.252
AND HE'S FEELING ME UP

14:12.352 --> 14:14.721
AND I THOUGHT
TO MYSELF, "IT'S GONNA
HAPPEN ANY MOMENT NOW."

14:14.821 --> 14:17.090
AND I JUST--

14:17.190 --> 14:19.893
I JUST COULDN'T DO IT.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.295
I SIMPLY CLOSED
MY LEGS SHUT. I--

14:22.395 --> 14:24.631
I COULDN'T DO IT.
I COULDN'T DO IT
TO ANDREW.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.434
I JUST-- I JUST
COULDN'T DO IT.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.773
WELL, SEEMS LIKE
QUITE A NIGHT OUT.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.909
YEAH, WELL THAT'S NOT
THE END OF IT

14:36.009 --> 14:39.412
BECAUSE THIS IDIOT--
I TOLD HIM,

14:39.512 --> 14:42.749
"I'M REALLY SORRY
BUT I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
I CAN'T DO THIS."

14:42.849 --> 14:44.651
AND HE LAUGHS IN MY FACE
AND SAYS "BOOHOO."

14:44.751 --> 14:47.387
AND HE GRABS
MY HANDS AND HE SAYS,
"LISTEN, CUPCAKE,

14:47.487 --> 14:51.191
YOU THINK YOU CAN LEAVE ME
HIGH AND DRY LIKE THIS?"
POINTING AT HIS DICK.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.860
"THE LEAST YOU CAN DO
IS MAKE IT UP TO ME."

14:53.961 --> 14:55.929
I SAID TO HIM,
"WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:56.029 --> 14:57.830
YOU WANT--
YOU WANT SOME MONEY?"

14:57.931 --> 15:00.800
HE SAID,
"GIVE ME A HAND JOB

15:00.900 --> 15:03.103
AND THERE'LL BE NO HARD
FEELINGS."

15:03.203 --> 15:06.940
AND I SAID TO HIM, "WHAT'S,
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
ARE YOU CRAZY?"

15:07.040 --> 15:10.277
AND HE JUST-- IT WAS JUST
GETTING REALLY STRANGE.
I MEAN, IT WAS TENSE.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.180
HIS TONE CHANGED.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.918
AND THEN-- AND THEN
I THOUGHT OF YOU...

15:21.254 --> 15:24.524
WHAT YOU'D SAY ABOUT IT.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.660
I THOUGHT ABOUT US GOING
THROUGH THIS IN THERAPY.

15:27.760 --> 15:32.465
AND WHAT DID YOU
IMAGINE US SAYING?

15:34.701 --> 15:39.039
I IMAGINED YOU NOT BEING
ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT...

15:40.907 --> 15:43.043
THAT YOU'D BE DISGUSTED.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.446
IS THAT WHY YOU RAN
OVER HERE?

15:46.546 --> 15:51.518
TO FIND OUT IF I WOULD
BE DISGUSTED?

15:51.618 --> 15:55.022
I DIDN'T RUN.

15:56.223 --> 15:59.292
I GAVE HIM THE HAND JOB.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.506
EXCUSE ME.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.016
( coughing )

16:24.084 --> 16:27.154
( retches )

16:30.657 --> 16:34.261
( toilet flushes )

16:34.361 --> 16:36.263
Paul:
ARE YOU OKAY?

16:36.363 --> 16:39.099
YEAH.
YEAH, I'M FINE.

17:27.714 --> 17:31.584
( coffee pouring )

17:48.067 --> 17:50.002
YEAH.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.739
THANK YOU.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.610
WE, UM--

17:57.710 --> 18:00.713
WE TALKED
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE CLUB LAST NIGHT,

18:00.813 --> 18:03.516
BUT WE NEVER GOT BACK
TO ACTUALLY TALKING

18:03.616 --> 18:07.520
ABOUT ANDREW
AND THAT ARGUMENT
YESTERDAY.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.490
I DON'T WANNA BE PUT
IN THIS POSITION.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.025
I DON'T WANNA
HAVE THIS POWER
TO DECIDE OUR FUTURE

18:13.126 --> 18:14.861
FOR BOTH OF US.
I JUST DON'T.

18:14.961 --> 18:18.030
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHY ANDREW CHOSE THIS
PARTICULAR TIME?

18:18.131 --> 18:21.067
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- DO YOU THINK THAT ANDREW

18:21.168 --> 18:25.372
JUST OUT OF THE BLUE,
AS YOU SAID YOURSELF,

18:25.472 --> 18:27.307
CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA
OF AN ULTIMATUM?

18:27.407 --> 18:30.243
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
OVER THE LAST COUPLE
OF DAYS OR WEEKS

18:30.343 --> 18:33.813
THAT YOU THINK MIGHT HAVE
BROUGHT THIS ON?

18:33.913 --> 18:36.883
NOTHING. I DON'T KNOW.
HE JUST LOST IT.
( chuckles )

18:36.983 --> 18:39.552
I MEAN, SHIT,
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT MEN
ARE THE NEW WOMEN?

18:39.652 --> 18:41.521
OBSESSED WITH WEDDINGS
AND CHILDREN.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.523
AND LATELY HE'S LOST
TOUCH WITH REALITY.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.425
HE-- HE THINKS
I'M SEEING SOMEONE.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.127
THAT'S HOW THIS
WHOLE THING STARTED.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

18:48.228 --> 18:51.231
BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.999
YOU WERE WATCHING TV
AND THEN SUDDENLY--

18:53.099 --> 18:54.934
WELL, WE WERE WATCHING TV.
BUT BEFORE THAT

18:55.034 --> 18:57.470
WE WERE HAVING DINNER
AND HE HAD THIS LOOK
ON HIS FACE.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.540
HE HAD THIS SAD LOOK
AND I COULD JUST TELL
SOMETHING WAS UP.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.509
I MEAN, YOU CAN
JUST TELL, RIGHT?

19:02.609 --> 19:04.511
AND I SAID TO HIM,
"WHAT'S GOING ON?"
AND HE SAID,

19:04.611 --> 19:07.180
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT.
I JUST KNOW I DON'T WANT

19:07.280 --> 19:09.849
THIS ON-AND-OFF THING."
SO I SAID TO HIM,

19:09.949 --> 19:13.085
"SURE, THEN LET'S JUST DECIDE:
EITHER WE GET MARRIED
OR WE SPLIT."

19:13.186 --> 19:14.787
SO YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO CAME UP WITH IT.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.689
- WITH WHAT?
- THE ULTIMATUM.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.726
NO, HE'S THE ONE.
HE-- HE HAD THE PROBLEM
WITH THE ON-AND-OFF THING.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.462
- NOT ME.
- YEAH, BUT ON-AND-OFF
CAN MEAN SEVERAL THINGS.

19:22.562 --> 19:25.198
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO MADE IT SPECIFIC--

19:25.298 --> 19:27.867
"GET MARRIED OR TO SPLIT UP."
THAT WAS YOUR ULTIMATUM.

19:27.967 --> 19:31.070
NO NO NO, HE HAD THIS THING
WITH THE ON AND O--

19:31.170 --> 19:33.340
THE ULTIM--

19:37.244 --> 19:40.146
YEAH, OKAY,

19:40.247 --> 19:42.014
I WAS THE FIRST ONE
TO SAY IT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.951
BUT HE JUMPED ALL OVER IT.
I SAID I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WANT.

19:45.051 --> 19:48.588
AND HE SAID,
"YOU HAVE A DAY OR TWO MAX
TO DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT."

19:48.688 --> 19:50.923
AND I SAID "FINE."
AND THEN HE STARTED CRYING

19:51.023 --> 19:53.393
AND BLAH BLAH BLAH.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.362
THE WHOLE THING WAS
REALLY SCARY TO HIM,
I THINK.

19:55.462 --> 19:58.765
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WEREN'T YOU SCARED?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.166
OF WHAT?

20:00.267 --> 20:01.968
OF SPLITTING UP.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.837
I WASN'T SUGGESTING
THAT WE SPLIT UP.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.474
SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK WAS THE POINT
OF THIS ARGUMENT

20:07.574 --> 20:09.242
THAT YOU MAY HAVE
INITIATED?

20:09.342 --> 20:10.710
I DIDN'T INITIATE ANYTHING.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.813
YOU MAY
NOT HAVE MEANT TO,
BUT YOU DID.

20:13.913 --> 20:19.719
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU WANTED TO BRING THIS
RELATIONSHIP INTO CRISIS.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.689
I KNOW YOU SAY THAT ANDREW
HATES UNCERTAINTIES,

20:22.789 --> 20:27.660
BUT PERHAPS YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO CAN'T
LIVE WITH THEM.

20:28.995 --> 20:33.333
I MEAN, WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
THIS PARTICULAR TIME

20:33.433 --> 20:37.236
- TO BRING THINGS TO A HEAD?
- I DID NO SUCH THING.

20:40.707 --> 20:43.510
WHY NOW?

20:47.314 --> 20:50.016
BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.353
ANDREW'S RIGHT.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.589
I AM BEING
UNFAITHFUL TO HIM.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.659
YOU MEAN WHAT
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT

20:59.759 --> 21:02.228
AT THE CLUB?

21:02.329 --> 21:04.864
NOT JUST LAST NIGHT.

21:06.666 --> 21:10.370
I'VE-- I'VE BEEN UNFAITHFUL
TO HIM FOR A LONG TIME.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.841
AHEM, SO WHY--
WHY HAVEN'T WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS BEFORE?

21:17.744 --> 21:19.812
I THINK WE HAVE.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.818
IT'S BEEN HERE ALL ALONG.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.956
YOU MEAN TO SAY
YOU'VE NEVER NOTICED IT?

21:33.326 --> 21:34.861
YOU'RE SURPRISED.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.431
( chuckles )
NO, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

21:38.531 --> 21:41.300
I-- I JUST--
I DON'T FOLLOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.770
( scoffs )

21:50.710 --> 21:55.715
THIS ISN'T THE REACTION
I WAS HOPING FOR.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.485
NOT AT ALL.

21:58.585 --> 22:02.755
WHAT WAS
THE REACTION THAT YOU
WERE HOPING FOR?

22:04.090 --> 22:07.293
I-- I HAD...

22:07.394 --> 22:09.061
TWO SCENARIOS
IN MY HEAD.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.832
IN THE FIRST
ONE YOU STAND UP
AND YOU HUG ME...

22:14.300 --> 22:16.335
AND YOU SAY,
"I LOVE YOU.

22:16.436 --> 22:19.772
I LOVE YOU TOO, LAURA.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.808
I'VE BEEN FEELING THIS WAY
FOR A LONG TIME.

22:21.908 --> 22:24.744
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO BE THE FIRST ONE
TO SAY IT."

22:26.546 --> 22:29.015
AND THEN WE MAKE LOVE.

22:31.484 --> 22:34.787
AND THE, UM--

22:34.887 --> 22:37.056
THE SECOND SCENARIO?

22:37.156 --> 22:40.292
IT'S LIKE
THE FIRST ONE BUT--

22:40.393 --> 22:41.961
BUT WITHOUT THE SEX.

22:42.061 --> 22:44.764
WE JUST SIT HERE TOGETHER.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.902
( sighs )

22:50.002 --> 22:53.640
YOU KNOW, I'M-- I'M--
I'M EMBARRASSED TO EVEN
TALK ABOUT IT.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.042
I MEAN, YOU'RE SITTING THERE
LIKE A FUCKING BUDDHA

22:56.142 --> 22:59.812
ACTING LIKE YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
IT'S HUMILIATING.

23:02.615 --> 23:05.251
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
FELT LIKE THIS?

23:05.351 --> 23:07.720
A YEAR...

23:09.121 --> 23:11.458
FROM THE FIRST SESSION.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD GO AWAY.

23:11.558 --> 23:14.794
I THOUGHT IT'S
JUST AN INFATUATION,
THAT'S ALL.

23:16.328 --> 23:19.532
BUT IT'S GETTING WORSE.

23:19.632 --> 23:22.702
YOU'VE BECOME
THE CENTER OF MY LIFE.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.941
LAURA,

23:29.041 --> 23:31.911
I'M YOUR THERAPIST.

23:34.346 --> 23:37.750
THE PARAMETERS
AND THE LIMITATIONS...

23:39.318 --> 23:43.089
ARE ESTABLISHED
AND ETHICALLY DEFINED.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.894
I'M NOT AN OPTION.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.232
YOU MAY BE

23:53.332 --> 23:56.268
USING ME AS A--

23:56.368 --> 23:58.137
AS AN EXCUSE

23:58.237 --> 24:02.475
TO BAIL FROM YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH--
WITH ANDREW.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.652
YOU KNOW WHY I DIDN'T
FUCK THAT GUY?

24:14.253 --> 24:15.955
NOT BECAUSE OF ANDREW.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.090
NOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT TO CHEAT ON HIM.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.559
I DO WANT TO CHEAT
ON HIM--

24:19.659 --> 24:21.828
BUT WITH YOU.

24:25.932 --> 24:29.135
WHEN I WAS SITTING THERE
AT THE BAR BY MYSELF,

24:29.235 --> 24:32.071
I WAS THINKING
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF YOU WERE TO WALK IN?

24:32.171 --> 24:35.074
YOU'D WALK IN, YOU'D--
YOU'D SIT NEXT TO ME
AT THE BAR,

24:35.174 --> 24:36.743
YOU'D ORDER A DRINK.
I'D EVEN--

24:36.843 --> 24:39.579
I EVEN TRIED TO IMAGINE
WHAT YOU WOULD ORDER--

24:39.679 --> 24:42.014
A SHOT OF BOURBON MAYBE,
SOMETHING EXPENSIVE,

24:42.114 --> 24:45.484
SOMETHING FANCY.
THEN WE'D START TALKING--

24:45.585 --> 24:48.621
WHAT A COINCIDENCE
IT IS TO MEET LIKE THIS,

24:48.721 --> 24:51.691
HOW AWKWARD IT IS TO MEET
OUTSIDE THE OFFICE.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.795
AND THEN, WITHOUT WORDS,

24:55.895 --> 24:58.931
BECAUSE WE--
WE TALK ENOUGH
WHEN WE'RE HERE,

25:00.633 --> 25:03.803
YOU MOTION
FOR ME TO FOLLOW YOU
TO THE BATHROOM.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.874
AND I DO.

25:09.876 --> 25:13.780
WHEN I WENT
INTO THE STALL
WITH THAT GUY...

25:16.315 --> 25:18.585
I IMAGINED IT WAS YOU
BEHIND ME.

25:18.685 --> 25:21.020
THAT'S WHAT MADE IT
SO EXCITING.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.857
THEN THAT GUY
STARTED PEEING

25:24.957 --> 25:27.994
AND IT WOKE ME UP
AND I REALIZED THAT
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.963
I KNOW IT,
I UNDERSTAND IT.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.265
I TELL MYSELF THAT
EVERY TIME I WALK
OUT OF HERE.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.969
I KNOW IT, I UNDERSTAND IT
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT MY BODY
UNDERSTANDS IT.

25:39.706 --> 25:43.910
I KNOW IT CAN
NEVER HAPPEN.
I KNOW IT.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.312
SO DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT GONNA START
SHOWING UP HERE.

25:46.412 --> 25:49.448
I'M NOT GONNA START
STALKING YOU

25:49.548 --> 25:52.084
LIKE GLENN CLOSE
IN THAT MOVIE.

25:53.185 --> 25:56.222
I'M NOT GONNA BOIL
YOUR KIDS' RABBIT.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.257
I'M NOT DANGEROUS...

26:01.160 --> 26:03.630
AT LEAST NOT TO YOU.

26:03.730 --> 26:06.365
GOD, HOW CAN I
GO BACK TO MY LIFE,

26:06.465 --> 26:08.167
TO THE HOSPITAL,
TO ANDREW?

26:08.267 --> 26:11.904
NOT TO ANDREW,
WHEN THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS TO ME IS YOU.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.576
( footsteps approaching )

26:26.285 --> 26:28.788
OUR TIME'S UP.

26:31.357 --> 26:34.060
YES, IT IS.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.830
( sighs )

26:39.866 --> 26:42.001
I FEEL LIKE I CAME HERE
IN THE DARK

26:42.101 --> 26:44.904
AND I'M LEAVING
INTO A BIGGER DARKNESS.

26:48.507 --> 26:50.877
WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW?

26:52.812 --> 26:55.381
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
NEXT WEEK.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.851
OKAY?

27:03.189 --> 27:07.226
- ( piano music plays )
- I'LL CALL YOU A TAXI.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.829
NO, I'M FINE.

27:10.663 --> 27:13.065
ARE YOU SURE?

27:16.635 --> 27:18.871
HOW ARE YOU
GONNA GET HOME?

27:18.971 --> 27:22.141
( music continues )
