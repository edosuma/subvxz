00:01.736 --> 00:03.335
Thousands of people

00:03.371 --> 00:05.270
in the Chinese city of Foshan

00:05.306 --> 00:09.341
saw what they could only
describe as a floating city.

00:10.945 --> 00:12.678
Thousands of Chinese people

00:12.713 --> 00:14.546
flocked to social media

00:14.582 --> 00:18.250
with photos of UFOs flying over China.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.285
We're getting more and more

00:20.321 --> 00:22.321
of these anomalous phenomena

00:22.356 --> 00:25.124
in the skies, which
the Chinese government

00:25.159 --> 00:26.158
are trying to dismiss.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.561
One has to wonder whether or not

00:29.597 --> 00:30.863
history is repeating itself,

00:30.898 --> 00:34.700
because in China, you have
stories of flying dragons.

00:35.836 --> 00:38.370
Extraterrestrials may have

00:38.406 --> 00:42.941
been living amongst the Chinese
for thousands of years.

00:42.977 --> 00:45.844
And finally the veil is being lifted

00:45.880 --> 00:47.980
on the true history of China.

00:48.015 --> 00:51.150
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:51.185 --> 00:55.521
mankind has credited its origins to gods

00:55.556 --> 00:57.723
and other visitors from the stars.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.559
What if it were true?

01:00.594 --> 01:03.462
Did extraterrestrial beings

01:03.497 --> 01:06.665
really help to shape our history?

01:06.700 --> 01:08.667
And if so,

01:08.702 --> 01:12.171
could there be
a connection between aliens

01:12.206 --> 01:15.207
and China's Hidden Empire?

# Ancient Aliens 11x09 #
The Hidden Empire
Original Air Date on July 15, 2016

01:45.339 --> 01:49.408
January 26, 2011.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.978
Sun Shili-- a former Chinese
Foreign Ministry official,

01:53.013 --> 01:55.547
who worked directly with Mao Tse-tung--

01:55.583 --> 01:58.750
comes forward with a shocking revelation

01:58.786 --> 02:01.753
that is reported in
The Canadian newspaper.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.123
The Chinese government is aware

02:04.158 --> 02:07.693
of extraterrestrials visiting Earth.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.797
The government held an objective

02:11.832 --> 02:14.967
and practical attitude,
and allowed us to do

02:15.002 --> 02:18.170
abundant research, reports
and discussions on the topic.

02:18.205 --> 02:21.273
They pay great attention to this topic,

02:21.308 --> 02:23.308
especially the military,

02:23.344 --> 02:26.378
the air force and
civil aviation departments,

02:26.413 --> 02:29.548
which encounter UFO cases frequently.

02:29.583 --> 02:34.419
Sun Shili said that not only
were the Chinese government

02:34.455 --> 02:39.491
aware that extraterrestrials
were visiting the Earth,

02:39.527 --> 02:43.695
but also that some aliens
were actually living among us

02:43.731 --> 02:46.231
disguised in human form.

02:46.267 --> 02:50.269
His revelations are
an absolute bombshell.

02:50.304 --> 02:54.506
I mean, clearly this
shines a new light on

02:54.542 --> 02:57.309
what may have been going on
in relation to this subject

02:57.344 --> 02:59.311
in one of the most

02:59.346 --> 03:02.581
secret societies on
the face of this planet.

03:02.616 --> 03:06.952
Shili claimed to have
discovered sensitive information

03:06.987 --> 03:10.289
about government knowledge
of extraterrestrials

03:10.324 --> 03:13.192
while serving Chairman Mao,

03:13.227 --> 03:16.595
and he also had his own close encounter.

03:18.098 --> 03:21.633
In 1972, I was in the central government.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.903
I was working in the
foreign affairs department.

03:24.939 --> 03:27.839
We were on evening duty when we saw

03:27.875 --> 03:31.476
a shiny UFO in the sky,
like a small moon.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.880
It was smaller than the moon
but was very bright.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.382
It moved up and down.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.986
It disappeared after
about ten minutes or so.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.757
Initially, Shili regarded the spectacle

03:45.793 --> 03:49.928
as a type of Cold War
intelligence monitoring device.

03:49.964 --> 03:53.665
But years later, after working
within elevated levels

03:53.701 --> 03:55.467
of the Chinese government,

03:55.502 --> 03:59.638
he was certain he had witnessed
an alien spacecraft.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.842
I met Dr. Sun Shili

04:03.877 --> 04:07.879
in 2013 in Washington D.C.

04:07.915 --> 04:12.484
We were both speakers at the
Citizen Hearing on Disclosure.

04:12.519 --> 04:15.887
I had a chance to
meet with, uh, Sun Shili

04:15.923 --> 04:19.057
and, um, discuss some of this
with him firsthand.

04:19.093 --> 04:22.427
He's entirely sincere about this.

04:24.698 --> 04:25.964
Could Sun Shili--

04:26.000 --> 04:27.633
a man who worked closely

04:27.668 --> 04:31.036
with one of the most powerful
world leaders in history--

04:31.071 --> 04:33.305
really have inside knowledge

04:33.340 --> 04:37.976
about extraterrestrials visiting Earth?

04:38.012 --> 04:41.380
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes

04:41.415 --> 04:44.449
and suggest that China--

04:44.485 --> 04:47.052
a historically isolationist country--

04:47.087 --> 04:49.087
may have secretly been in contact

04:49.123 --> 04:51.690
with extraterrestrials for decades

04:51.725 --> 04:54.760
and possibly longer.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.896
China has always been insular.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.832
There's always been a sense
that the rest of the world

05:00.868 --> 05:03.568
was unimportant,
that China was for China

05:03.604 --> 05:06.104
and for the Chinese,
and they were very careful

05:06.140 --> 05:08.307
about any secrets that came out.

05:08.342 --> 05:11.476
China is a notoriously closed

05:11.512 --> 05:14.112
and secretive society.

05:14.148 --> 05:18.216
Is this in relation to UFOs
because they know something?

05:18.252 --> 05:21.119
Could it be that they found something?

05:21.155 --> 05:23.722
The Chinese government does not

05:23.757 --> 05:27.125
feel obligated to explain
their views on UFOs

05:27.161 --> 05:29.361
or their research.

05:29.396 --> 05:32.097
I am sure they are concerned that, um,

05:32.132 --> 05:34.700
those who study UFOs sometimes

05:34.735 --> 05:39.137
see military tests
in the skies of China.

05:39.173 --> 05:43.608
They are a self-immersed civilization

05:43.644 --> 05:46.578
and they don't feel perhaps

05:46.613 --> 05:48.847
that they need to share
all their historical knowledge

05:48.882 --> 05:51.016
with the others.

05:52.586 --> 05:55.020
China is the world's
most populous country,

05:55.055 --> 05:59.391
with a unique blend of ancient
and modern civilization.

05:59.426 --> 06:02.227
Westerners have long held a fascination

06:02.262 --> 06:04.596
with this distant land, in part

06:04.631 --> 06:08.166
because it seems
to hold so many secrets.

06:08.202 --> 06:11.970
From the construction
of the 13,000-mile-long

06:12.005 --> 06:13.905
Great Wall of China,

06:13.941 --> 06:17.509
erected thousands of years ago,

06:17.544 --> 06:20.712
to the so-called digital
"Great Firewall"

06:20.748 --> 06:22.881
restricting the Internet today--

06:22.916 --> 06:26.017
China has taken extraordinary measures

06:26.053 --> 06:28.320
that have prevented both
people and information

06:28.355 --> 06:31.790
from entering or leaving its domain.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.659
But why?

06:36.296 --> 06:39.064
According to ancient
astronaut theorists,

06:39.099 --> 06:41.032
the answer may be found

06:41.068 --> 06:45.036
by looking back 5,000 years
to China's beginnings

06:45.072 --> 06:48.507
and the reign of their
very first ruler--

06:48.542 --> 06:51.777
the Yellow Emperor.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.746
The Yellow Emperor
is understood to be

06:54.782 --> 06:56.415
a human figure, but

06:56.450 --> 06:59.317
originally in his earlier incarnation

06:59.353 --> 07:02.988
he was actually
a divine celestial figure.

07:03.023 --> 07:07.225
He was a god associated
with thunder and lightning,

07:07.261 --> 07:08.827
more specifically.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.564
And he was thought to reside in the sky.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.570
The reign of the Yellow Emperor,
which purportedly

07:18.605 --> 07:22.274
lasted 100 years,
was thought to be a high point

07:22.309 --> 07:25.844
of Chinese culture and of civilization.

07:25.879 --> 07:29.881
So he's associated with a number
of technological developments

07:29.917 --> 07:33.685
spanning from the calendar,

07:33.720 --> 07:35.687
advances in mathematics,

07:35.722 --> 07:40.225
astronomy, agricultural
techniques, writing as well.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.361
According to ancient accounts,

07:43.397 --> 07:45.163
the Yellow Emperor possessed knowledge

07:45.199 --> 07:47.332
of advanced technology,

07:47.367 --> 07:50.135
and invented many mechanical devices,

07:50.170 --> 07:52.838
including a cauldron that was oriented

07:52.873 --> 07:56.374
towards the Syuan Yuan star,

07:56.410 --> 08:00.078
the star from which he
is said to have descended.

08:00.113 --> 08:03.648
It was written that the cauldron
could make a dragon appear

08:03.684 --> 08:05.817
from the sky.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.420
When the time was right,
he crafted the cauldron,

08:08.455 --> 08:12.190
and in it he threw in
some alchemical ingredients,

08:12.226 --> 08:13.959
uh, elixir ingredients.

08:16.063 --> 08:20.065
And immediately the heavens
opened and a dragon emerged.

08:21.802 --> 08:25.103
So a flying dragon sometimes described

08:25.138 --> 08:27.739
with metallic skin,

08:27.774 --> 08:30.275
one has to wonder
do we have descriptions

08:30.310 --> 08:32.644
of nuts and bolts machines?

08:32.679 --> 08:36.181
Could these be nothing
else but descriptions

08:36.216 --> 08:37.849
of misunderstood technology?

08:40.419 --> 08:42.020
Based on our research,

08:42.054 --> 08:44.121
the Yellow Emperor arrived

08:44.157 --> 08:46.091
in the wonderful land of
China through an aircraft.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.295
We Chinese people consider ourselves

08:50.330 --> 08:53.798
the descendants of the dragon.

08:53.834 --> 08:57.335
In UFO research, a dragon
is the symbol of aircraft,

08:57.371 --> 09:00.672
that is, the symbol of a UFO.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.645
Is it possible the Yellow Emperor

09:06.680 --> 09:09.915
was an extraterrestrial
that was responsible

09:09.950 --> 09:11.917
for starting Chinese civilization

09:11.952 --> 09:14.853
over 5,000 years ago?

09:14.888 --> 09:18.056
And if so, might subsequent emperors,

09:18.091 --> 09:20.959
who all claimed to be
descendants of Huangdi,

09:20.994 --> 09:23.528
have been at least part alien as well?

09:28.235 --> 09:30.001
In China's ancient history,

09:30.037 --> 09:34.739
it was often forbidden
to look upon the emperor.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.642
And from 1420 to 1912,

09:37.678 --> 09:40.111
emperors were actually walled off

09:40.147 --> 09:43.348
from the public within a
massive citadel in Beijing

09:43.383 --> 09:45.050
known as the Forbidden City.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.923
The design of the Forbidden City
was meticulously planned

09:51.959 --> 09:54.859
to shield the emperor
from the outside world,

09:54.895 --> 09:59.464
as well as symbolize Chinese
philosophy and religion.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.866
The Forbidden City was considered to be

10:01.902 --> 10:05.236
an earthly counterpart
to an extraterrestrial city.

10:06.873 --> 10:10.008
A monk received the plan
for the city in a vision,

10:10.043 --> 10:14.746
and it was built of stones, some
of them weighing over 300 tons.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.382
The full name of the
Forbidden City is actually

10:17.417 --> 10:18.717
"the Purple Forbidden City",

10:18.752 --> 10:22.153
and this refers to a constellation,

10:22.189 --> 10:25.924
which is known as the
"purple enclosure," in the skies.

10:25.959 --> 10:30.829
This constellation is said
to house the celestial emperor

10:30.864 --> 10:32.864
and his immediate entourage.

10:32.899 --> 10:36.167
So, the Forbidden City in
Beijing is considered to be

10:36.203 --> 10:38.737
a earthly or terrestrial counterpart

10:38.772 --> 10:43.842
of this celestial palace
up in the stars.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.777
So you have to wonder,

10:45.812 --> 10:50.181
might these Chinese emperors
have been aliens

10:50.217 --> 10:54.452
living both among people
of the Earth and in the sky?

10:56.623 --> 10:59.891
Was the practice
of hiding Chinese emperors

10:59.926 --> 11:05.230
implemented to conceal flesh
and blood extraterrestrials?

11:05.265 --> 11:09.601
And, if so, might there
still be aliens living among--

11:09.636 --> 11:13.638
and in fact ruling--
the Chinese people,

11:13.674 --> 11:17.342
just as former
Chinese official Sun Shili

11:17.377 --> 11:19.477
claims there are today?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.247
Ancient astronaut theorists

11:22.282 --> 11:24.449
propose further evidence

11:24.484 --> 11:27.352
lies buried in an isolated desert

11:27.387 --> 11:31.456
in the form of mysterious mummies.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.128
When they've actually tested

11:37.164 --> 11:39.998
the mitochondrial DNA of these mummies,

11:40.033 --> 11:43.301
there are anomalies that do not add up

11:43.336 --> 11:44.836
to genetic information that we have

11:44.871 --> 11:46.004
from anywhere else.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
_

11:49.067 --> 11:52.035
Heilongjiang Province, China.

11:52.070 --> 11:55.205
June 1994.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.942
Red Flag logging camp.

11:58.977 --> 12:03.113
Tree farmer Meng Zhaoguo
spots what he believes to be

12:03.148 --> 12:08.151
a helicopter crashing into
the nearby Dragon Mountains.

12:08.186 --> 12:11.821
He sets out to investigate,

12:11.857 --> 12:15.091
and when he reaches
the lip of the valley,

12:15.127 --> 12:19.295
he is struck on the head
and knocked unconscious.

12:21.133 --> 12:24.401
He wakes up several days later
in his bedroom at home,

12:24.436 --> 12:25.769
doesn't know how he got there.

12:27.339 --> 12:29.906
But he also that day has a visitation

12:29.941 --> 12:33.209
by what he describes as a
ten-foot-tall extraterrestrial

12:33.245 --> 12:36.112
female with six fingers.

12:36.148 --> 12:38.882
They're floating
in the air above his bed.

12:38.917 --> 12:40.850
Suddenly she vanishes.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.352
She walks through the wall in his room

12:42.387 --> 12:44.487
and he floats back into his bed.

12:46.358 --> 12:49.526
While this account
is certainly fantastical,

12:49.561 --> 12:52.962
Beijing-based psychologists
and police technicians

12:52.998 --> 12:57.067
subjected Zhaoguo to
a rigorous examination,

12:57.102 --> 13:01.004
including hypnosis and
a lie detector test and

13:01.039 --> 13:04.441
concluded his story to be truthful.

13:04.476 --> 13:07.610
Zhaoguo is one of literally thousands

13:07.646 --> 13:11.815
who have come forward in China
in recent years to say

13:11.850 --> 13:15.452
that they have had
extraterrestrial encounters.

13:15.487 --> 13:19.055
But his abduction by
this otherworldly giant

13:19.091 --> 13:21.091
is particularly significant

13:21.126 --> 13:25.028
because of an extraordinary
archaeological discovery

13:25.063 --> 13:29.866
in China that dates back
nearly 4,000 years.

13:31.503 --> 13:34.070
The Taklamakan Desert,

13:34.106 --> 13:36.473
known as "the Sea of Death".

13:36.508 --> 13:39.375
It is a vast, unforgiving land

13:39.411 --> 13:42.879
shrouded in myths and lost to time.

13:44.149 --> 13:45.915
The Taklamakan Desert

13:45.951 --> 13:50.487
is located in the northwest of China...

13:55.627 --> 13:58.194
While the Taklamakan Desert

13:58.230 --> 14:02.665
is one of the least habitable
places on Earth, astoundingly,

14:02.701 --> 14:06.469
over the last three decades,
Chinese archaeologists

14:06.505 --> 14:09.906
working in the Tarim Basin
region have excavated

14:09.941 --> 14:12.509
hundreds of tombs that date back

14:12.544 --> 14:17.514
to as early as 1800 BC.

14:17.549 --> 14:19.048
The well-preserved

14:19.084 --> 14:21.017
nature of the mummified bodies

14:21.052 --> 14:22.585
allowed archaeologists

14:22.621 --> 14:25.121
to conduct modern DNA analyses

14:25.157 --> 14:29.459
that determined the ancient
travelers were not Chinese.

15:05.063 --> 15:07.630
Now, these mummies were very curious

15:07.666 --> 15:09.899
in that some of them have

15:09.935 --> 15:13.269
what the biologists
call Europoid features.

15:13.305 --> 15:16.272
This means they have angular faces.

15:16.308 --> 15:18.508
They have recessed eyes.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.276
They have white skin.

15:20.312 --> 15:22.045
They have elongated bodies,

15:22.080 --> 15:24.714
and they have curly hair

15:24.749 --> 15:28.618
that can be red, blonde, or dark brown.

15:28.653 --> 15:31.321
When they've actually tested

15:31.356 --> 15:34.557
the mitochondrial DNA of these mummies,

15:34.593 --> 15:38.628
they find Haplogroups M and K,
which are actually

15:38.663 --> 15:42.232
genetic DNA markers suggesting

15:42.267 --> 15:45.134
Western European genetic lineage.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.936
However, there is a problem.

15:46.972 --> 15:49.239
There are anomalies in the DNA.

15:49.274 --> 15:51.341
There are things that do not add up...

15:52.711 --> 15:55.478
...to any known surviving relics

15:55.513 --> 15:57.513
of genetic information

15:57.549 --> 15:59.015
that we have from anywhere else.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.017
This suggests that these people

16:01.052 --> 16:03.353
may in fact be extraterrestrials.

16:05.323 --> 16:07.457
Could the mysterious mummies

16:07.492 --> 16:09.058
discovered at the Tarim Basin

16:09.094 --> 16:12.195
really be of alien origin?

16:14.165 --> 16:18.134
And might it also be possible
that the giant being

16:18.169 --> 16:22.939
Meng Zhaoguo encountered
in his home in 1994

16:22.974 --> 16:27.110
is a member of the same alien race?

16:27.145 --> 16:31.180
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes and suggest

16:31.216 --> 16:32.949
further proof can be found

16:32.984 --> 16:35.485
by examining the evidence discovered

16:35.520 --> 16:39.188
at one of China's most secret pyramids.

16:42.694 --> 16:44.460
Why would the pipes

16:44.496 --> 16:46.596
be specifically going up to a pyramid

16:46.631 --> 16:47.797
on the top of a mountain?

16:47.832 --> 16:49.499
Is it possible

16:49.534 --> 16:50.700
that Mount Baigong

16:50.735 --> 16:52.035
was some kind of

16:52.070 --> 16:55.271
extraterrestrial base?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.500
_

16:59.001 --> 17:03.804
Shaanxi Province, China, 1947.

17:03.839 --> 17:07.741
Colonel Maurice Sheahan,
the Far East director

17:07.777 --> 17:09.276
for Trans World Airlines...

17:10.746 --> 17:14.615
...is flying over Central China,
when he spots

17:14.650 --> 17:16.183
a white jewel-topped structure

17:16.218 --> 17:20.988
that he estimates to be
a 1,000-foot-high pyramid.

17:21.022 --> 17:23.257
Colonel Maurice Sheahan looks down

17:23.291 --> 17:25.326
and he sees a giant pyramid

17:25.361 --> 17:29.430
that he says is larger than
the Great Pyramid of Giza.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.598
He reports this to The New York Times

17:31.634 --> 17:33.133
and it causes a sensation.

17:33.169 --> 17:37.371
On March 27, 1947,

17:37.406 --> 17:41.709
Colonel Sheahan's eyewitness
account is circulated worldwide

17:41.744 --> 17:43.444
when The New York Times

17:43.479 --> 17:46.981
reports his story and
two days later a photograph

17:47.016 --> 17:49.917
of the mysterious structure is printed.

17:49.952 --> 17:52.553
Since then, 37 more pyramids

17:52.588 --> 17:55.789
have been sighted in this area of China,

17:55.825 --> 17:59.259
including the mausoleum
of the first Chin emperor,

17:59.295 --> 18:03.530
where we find the incredible
terra-cotta warriors.

18:03.566 --> 18:05.466
It suggests that ancient China

18:05.501 --> 18:08.535
was a place where pyramid
building was rampant.

18:11.140 --> 18:13.507
It was always known

18:13.542 --> 18:16.410
that there were pyramids in China,

18:16.445 --> 18:19.813
but only in the last, uh, decades,

18:19.849 --> 18:22.516
Chinese archaeologists start

18:22.551 --> 18:25.786
to publish books about these pyramids.

18:25.821 --> 18:30.190
They are all related
to the original rulers.

18:31.927 --> 18:35.562
Ancient astronaut theorists
contend not only that

18:35.598 --> 18:39.967
the formations found in Xian
are pyramids, but also that

18:40.002 --> 18:42.069
another structure discovered here

18:42.104 --> 18:45.506
points to a connection to the heavens.

18:49.278 --> 18:54.515
In the summer of 1999,
the oldest known altar used

18:54.550 --> 18:58.118
in Chinese state religious
practice was unearthed in Xian

18:58.154 --> 19:01.922
by the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.

19:01.957 --> 19:06.260
It is estimated that
17 Chinese emperors conducted

19:06.295 --> 19:09.463
religious rites at the
so-called Altar of Heaven

19:09.498 --> 19:14.535
that dates back to at least 581 AD.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.471
All the Chinese kings communicated

19:17.506 --> 19:20.874
with the extraterrestrials,
the gods from heaven,

19:20.910 --> 19:25.379
on the so-called Altar of Heaven.

19:25.414 --> 19:29.249
But the same stone structure,
with different ring

19:29.285 --> 19:32.920
about the main altar, we find in Peru,

19:32.955 --> 19:36.490
over the city of Saksaywaman.

19:36.525 --> 19:40.094
And, the rulers of the Inca
were, of course again,

19:40.129 --> 19:43.797
the descendants from heaven,
like in China.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.300
It's incredibly unique

19:46.335 --> 19:48.669
that you have Muyuq Marka in Peru,

19:48.704 --> 19:50.170
and the Altar of Heaven in China,

19:50.206 --> 19:52.473
coming from two very different cultures,

19:52.508 --> 19:55.776
two different time periods,
that you have so many unique

19:55.811 --> 19:57.978
similarities between
these two structures,

19:58.013 --> 20:02.249
and they're both used for
communication with the gods.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.751
Could that suggest that
these ancient cultures

20:04.787 --> 20:06.453
were trying to worship and venerate

20:06.489 --> 20:08.422
the same extraterrestrial gods

20:08.457 --> 20:10.624
that may have visited
this planet in ancient times?

20:11.927 --> 20:12.926
Is it possible

20:12.962 --> 20:14.361
that the mysterious structures

20:14.396 --> 20:17.664
found in and around
the city of Xian, China,

20:17.700 --> 20:20.667
were used by ancient rulers to connect

20:20.703 --> 20:23.303
with otherworldly beings?

20:25.608 --> 20:28.976
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that another,

20:29.011 --> 20:32.546
even more mysterious
pyramid, can be found

20:32.581 --> 20:38.285
roughly 500 miles west of Xian
in the province of Qinghai,

20:38.320 --> 20:40.988
atop Mount Baigong.

20:42.525 --> 20:46.360
In 2003 a team of Chinese
scientists went to Tibet

20:46.395 --> 20:49.696
and investigated the
infamous Mount Baigong...

20:51.467 --> 20:53.767
...which has, as they discovered,

20:53.802 --> 20:55.836
a 200-foot-tall pyramid

20:55.871 --> 20:57.571
at the top of the mountain.

20:57.606 --> 21:01.642
There was a system of caves
inside that had triangular faces

21:01.677 --> 21:04.244
at the openings of the
caves on three areas,

21:04.280 --> 21:09.016
and they found a variety of rusty pieces

21:09.051 --> 21:10.717
that were around the pyramid.

21:12.955 --> 21:16.290
Mount Baigong appears to be
an artificial pyramid

21:16.325 --> 21:19.426
with three triangular entrances

21:19.461 --> 21:23.130
going inside this mountain pyramid,

21:23.165 --> 21:26.700
and inside are all of
these metallic pipes.

21:26.735 --> 21:30.103
The floor of these caves

21:30.139 --> 21:33.240
are littered with metallic parts.

21:33.275 --> 21:36.376
It's like this was some kind of base.

21:39.448 --> 21:42.182
According to ancient astronaut theory,

21:42.218 --> 21:44.918
the reason that pyramids
are found all over the world

21:44.954 --> 21:46.653
from Egypt,

21:46.689 --> 21:48.055
to Peru,

21:48.090 --> 21:50.490
to Mexico

21:50.526 --> 21:53.227
is because our ancestors
were taught to build

21:53.262 --> 21:56.830
these structures by
extraterrestrial visitors.

21:56.865 --> 22:01.702
If the mysterious pipe-shaped
objects found at Mount Baigong

22:01.737 --> 22:05.505
were artificially manufactured
with advanced technology,

22:05.541 --> 22:09.676
could this be definitive proof
of alien intervention

22:09.712 --> 22:11.712
in the distant past?

22:13.716 --> 22:15.682
In Chinese mythology,

22:15.718 --> 22:19.953
the Kunlun Mountain was said
to be the center of the Earth,

22:19.989 --> 22:22.189
and it was supposedly

22:22.224 --> 22:25.892
a-a huge pillar of jade and jasper

22:25.928 --> 22:28.428
and precious gems that

22:28.464 --> 22:30.530
reached up into the sky.

22:30.566 --> 22:33.900
Mount Kunlun is a mythical mountain

22:33.936 --> 22:38.872
that is an axis mundi,
which is a central pillar

22:38.907 --> 22:41.775
around which the entire
universe revolves.

22:41.810 --> 22:43.677
This is a connector

22:43.712 --> 22:48.649
between Earth and
the rest of the universe.

22:48.684 --> 22:54.254
It's where celestial beings can
communicate with earthly beings.

22:54.290 --> 22:58.792
You have to wonder if
Mount Baigong is not

22:58.827 --> 23:01.662
this mythical Kunlun Mountain

23:01.697 --> 23:05.532
that was some kind of
extraterrestrial base

23:05.567 --> 23:09.503
that spanned Earth and the stars.

23:12.675 --> 23:14.941
Could it be that extraterrestrials

23:14.977 --> 23:17.911
visited China thousands of years ago

23:17.946 --> 23:21.682
and left behind remnants
from an ancient base?

23:23.152 --> 23:24.885
Ancient astronaut theorists

23:24.920 --> 23:27.254
suggest China's biggest secrets

23:27.289 --> 23:30.991
may not be on top of its greatest peaks,

23:31.026 --> 23:34.294
but beneath its darkest depths.

23:37.299 --> 23:39.800
He discovered an underwater city,

23:39.835 --> 23:42.202
dwellings at the bottom of a lake.

23:42.237 --> 23:46.807
Did some kind of advanced
civilization exist

23:46.842 --> 23:48.542
beneath Fuxian Lake?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
_

23:55.459 --> 23:57.592
Fuxian Lake.

23:57.628 --> 24:01.563
Yunnan Province, China, 1992.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.432
Expert diver,

24:04.468 --> 24:06.534
Geng Wei, descends into this

24:06.570 --> 24:10.405
remote lake and discovers
a surprising phenomenon.

24:12.509 --> 24:15.677
The bottom is littered
with hand-carved flagstones

24:15.712 --> 24:18.146
and other stone relics.

24:19.716 --> 24:20.982
The mysterious stones

24:21.018 --> 24:22.984
lie scattered on the bottom

24:23.020 --> 24:25.687
of China's second deepest
freshwater lake,

24:25.722 --> 24:29.991
which covers an area of 100 square miles

24:30.027 --> 24:33.295
with a depth of 509 feet.

24:35.632 --> 24:38.266
What he saw was quite extraordinary.

24:38.302 --> 24:42.938
Hand-dressed flagstones,
roads, buildings.

24:44.141 --> 24:46.608
And it's as if he discovered

24:46.643 --> 24:48.176
an underwater city.

24:49.813 --> 24:51.980
That clearly has evidence of dwellings

24:52.015 --> 24:53.715
at the bottom of a lake.

24:53.750 --> 24:56.584
It was built when there wasn't a lake,

24:56.620 --> 24:59.154
and that would mean that
we're talking about a time

24:59.189 --> 25:02.090
before the last ice age,
which would bring

25:02.125 --> 25:04.125
the story of Fuxian Lake

25:04.161 --> 25:07.929
way more into the remote past
than what we're being told.

25:09.967 --> 25:12.834
Geng Wei made over 35 dives

25:12.869 --> 25:15.570
in Fuxian Lake,

25:15.605 --> 25:20.008
and they even took a submarine
down into this lake

25:20.043 --> 25:23.011
to find stairs

25:23.046 --> 25:27.816
and more of these flagstones
and walls beneath this lake.

25:27.851 --> 25:30.085
So you have to wonder,

25:30.120 --> 25:34.122
did some kind of advanced
civilization exist

25:34.157 --> 25:37.525
at one time beneath Fuxian Lake?

25:40.530 --> 25:43.298
In 2001, archaeologists

25:43.333 --> 25:45.767
from the Yunnan Provincial Museum

25:45.802 --> 25:49.004
used advanced sonar scanners and cameras

25:49.039 --> 25:53.908
to conduct the monumental task
of surveying Fuxian Lake.

25:55.078 --> 25:57.579
The evidence collected convinced

25:57.614 --> 26:00.715
Chinese archaeologists
they had discovered structures

26:00.751 --> 26:03.551
of an advanced civilization,

26:03.587 --> 26:07.555
including an arena-type
building and pyramids.

26:08.925 --> 26:11.893
This mysterious sunken city covers

26:11.928 --> 26:15.997
more than one square mile,
but the questions remain.

26:16.033 --> 26:19.334
Who built it and why?

26:19.369 --> 26:22.170
The pyramid itself is very unusual

26:22.205 --> 26:24.806
and it's-- it-it is
said that the pyramid

26:24.841 --> 26:27.776
is as old as the Egyptian pyramids are

26:27.811 --> 26:31.246
and maybe even higher than some of them.

26:31.281 --> 26:33.782
It's an incredible discovery.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.653
Ancient Chinese records

26:38.688 --> 26:40.021
speak of a city in the area

26:40.057 --> 26:42.390
of Fuxian Lake called Yuyuan.

26:42.426 --> 26:45.994
However, studies of the
underwater structures

26:46.029 --> 26:51.066
at Fuxian Lake show that
it's actually much older

26:51.101 --> 26:53.535
than this Yuyuan city.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.204
Could this be the
remains of some ancient

26:56.239 --> 27:00.942
and advanced society that was
destroyed in the Great Flood?

27:02.813 --> 27:06.247
Is it possible
that an extraterrestrial base

27:06.283 --> 27:08.950
is located deep underwater?

27:11.688 --> 27:14.856
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes

27:14.891 --> 27:17.092
and suggest USOs,

27:17.127 --> 27:19.794
or unidentified submersible objects,

27:19.830 --> 27:23.431
have been well chronicled
in ancient Chinese texts.

27:25.535 --> 27:28.136
According to Chen Jang Fu Zhi,

27:28.171 --> 27:29.537
a book written during the reign

27:29.573 --> 27:33.074
of Emperor Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty,

27:33.110 --> 27:36.244
a horse-like monster lived in the lake.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.613
The animal was described as being white

27:38.648 --> 27:40.482
with red spots on its back.

27:40.517 --> 27:42.484
More intriguingly, it was a creature

27:42.519 --> 27:45.086
that could actually take to the skies.

27:45.122 --> 27:49.624
This suggests it may have
been part USO, part UFO.

27:49.659 --> 27:51.893
That's to say,
an underwater submersible object

27:51.928 --> 27:55.196
and also an unidentified flying object.

27:57.868 --> 28:01.836
October 24, 1991.

28:01.872 --> 28:06.774
A local fisherman named
Zhang Yuxiang was fishing

28:06.810 --> 28:10.912
on Fuxian Lake during
a clear and tranquil day,

28:10.947 --> 28:15.783
when a dense fog suddenly rolled
across the vast body of water.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.252
In 1991,

28:17.287 --> 28:22.891
Zhang Yuxiang, a fisherman,
was at Fuxian Lake

28:22.926 --> 28:24.893
when he encountered a UFO.

28:24.928 --> 28:27.195
Now, this strange craft

28:27.230 --> 28:30.932
actually emerged from
the waters of the lake.

28:30.967 --> 28:33.801
He described it as a shining disc.

28:33.837 --> 28:38.206
This UFO was so close and so powerful

28:38.241 --> 28:40.675
that it actually tossed the boat around.

28:42.512 --> 28:46.981
And then rapidly this craft just
disappeared up into the sky.

28:47.017 --> 28:51.085
Lake Fuxian is clearly a-an area

28:51.121 --> 28:55.223
where there have been many
strange events over the years.

28:56.526 --> 28:57.992
Could the flying dragon

28:58.028 --> 29:00.195
that carried the Yellow Emperor

29:00.230 --> 29:02.564
described in ancient Chinese texts

29:02.599 --> 29:06.301
and the USO witnessed by Zhang Yuxiang

29:06.336 --> 29:09.037
be the same alien craft?

29:10.373 --> 29:12.173
And if so, is it possible

29:12.209 --> 29:14.342
that an extraterrestrial base

29:14.377 --> 29:17.912
exists at the bottom of Fuxian Lake?

29:19.249 --> 29:21.849
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes

29:21.885 --> 29:25.286
and claim strange sightings in China

29:25.322 --> 29:27.322
have become so numerous

29:27.357 --> 29:29.023
that soon the government

29:29.059 --> 29:30.191
will no longer be able

29:30.227 --> 29:32.760
to hide the truth.

29:36.032 --> 29:38.166
When the UFO was seen,

29:38.201 --> 29:39.734
all hell broke loose.

29:39.769 --> 29:42.003
Thousands of Chinese people

29:42.038 --> 29:43.938
flocked to social media with photos

29:43.974 --> 29:46.441
of UFOs flying over China.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
_

29:51.482 --> 29:53.382
Foshan, China.

29:53.417 --> 29:58.186
October 7, 2015.

29:58.222 --> 30:00.789
Above this sprawling metropolis,

30:00.824 --> 30:03.392
thousands of shocked residents witness

30:03.427 --> 30:05.861
an astonishing spectacle...

30:07.298 --> 30:11.099
a city hovering in the clouds.

30:11.135 --> 30:16.538
The apparition of a cityscape
is unmistakable and remains

30:16.573 --> 30:19.141
in the sky for several minutes,

30:19.176 --> 30:21.643
long enough to be captured on video,

30:21.679 --> 30:25.113
which is broadcast on Chinese television

30:25.149 --> 30:29.584
and subsequently disseminated
on social media across the globe.

30:30.888 --> 30:33.055
Numerous people reported seeing

30:33.090 --> 30:36.124
what looked like
skyscraper-type buildings

30:36.160 --> 30:39.394
in the clouds high in the sky.

30:39.430 --> 30:41.029
It was an amazing spectacle.

30:41.065 --> 30:43.031
There's just no other
way to describe it.

30:45.602 --> 30:47.135
While Chinese officials

30:47.171 --> 30:51.006
denounced the phenomenon as
an elaborate hoax, to date,

30:51.041 --> 30:52.741
no one has been able to prove

30:52.776 --> 30:54.509
that the footage is not authentic,

30:54.545 --> 30:56.311
and the video

30:56.347 --> 31:00.215
is backed up by the reports
of numerous eyewitnesses.

31:00.250 --> 31:04.519
But some argue that even
if the footage is genuine,

31:04.555 --> 31:07.255
it can be explained
by an optical illusion

31:07.291 --> 31:09.925
known as Fata Morgana.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.994
So, one theory about
what this could have been

31:12.029 --> 31:14.162
is something known as a Fata Morgana,

31:14.198 --> 31:16.965
and, uh, that's a-an
illusion type of effect.

31:18.302 --> 31:19.368
Think of a mirage,

31:19.403 --> 31:20.902
in which you're seeing something

31:20.938 --> 31:22.404
close to the horizon,

31:22.439 --> 31:24.506
and it'll give an effect of something

31:24.541 --> 31:26.108
that's-that's not there.

31:26.143 --> 31:27.609
It's an atmospheric illusion.

31:27.644 --> 31:29.878
The reason that I don't think

31:29.913 --> 31:32.414
that this is a Fata Morgana effect

31:32.449 --> 31:37.152
is because this is way
too high up to be one.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.022
Using the idea that

31:40.057 --> 31:42.057
this is some type of inversion layer

31:42.092 --> 31:45.527
to somehow broadcast or enhance
the idea of a cityscape

31:45.562 --> 31:47.496
in the sky just doesn't hold up.

31:47.531 --> 31:50.565
So, there could in fact
have been some type

31:50.601 --> 31:54.302
of a large mother ship
or some craft in the sky.

31:54.338 --> 31:55.637
This isn't new.

31:57.641 --> 31:59.341
Now, just a few days later,

31:59.376 --> 32:01.143
over 800 miles away,

32:01.178 --> 32:04.346
we had another sighting of
this exact same phenomenon.

32:04.381 --> 32:07.049
So, it stands to reason that
there was some type of

32:07.084 --> 32:10.218
physical presence in the sky.

32:10.254 --> 32:13.822
If we assume that the vision n the sky

32:13.857 --> 32:16.758
that was seen in Foshan
by thousands of people

32:16.794 --> 32:18.560
was just some kind of optical illusion,

32:18.595 --> 32:21.797
I find it highly coincidental
that the same vision is seen

32:21.832 --> 32:24.099
hundreds of miles away a few days later

32:24.134 --> 32:26.134
in another city called Jiangxi,

32:26.170 --> 32:28.370
also witnessed by thousands of people.

32:30.641 --> 32:31.840
Could thousands of people

32:31.875 --> 32:34.376
across China have really witnessed

32:34.411 --> 32:36.978
some type of alien base or mother ship

32:37.014 --> 32:39.014
floating in the sky?

32:41.685 --> 32:45.654
And if so, might it be evidence
of extraterrestrials

32:45.689 --> 32:47.856
making their presence known?

32:47.891 --> 32:51.393
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest

32:51.428 --> 32:53.095
there have been many more cases

32:53.130 --> 32:58.033
of alien entities appearing
in the skies above China.

32:58.068 --> 33:01.536
Cases that the government
could not ignore.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
_

33:04.675 --> 33:07.209
Zhejiang Province, China.

33:07.244 --> 33:10.345
July 7, 2010.

33:12.382 --> 33:14.883
Just after 8:40 p.m.,

33:14.918 --> 33:17.419
the Hangzhou Xiaoshan
International Airport,

33:17.454 --> 33:20.555
which serves over
70,000 passengers a day,

33:20.591 --> 33:24.192
is suddenly shut down.

33:24.228 --> 33:26.361
All outbound flights are grounded,

33:26.396 --> 33:30.765
and inbound flights are
diverted to nearby airports.

33:30.801 --> 33:35.537
The cause of the shutdown was
an unidentified flying object

33:35.572 --> 33:38.140
seen streaking across the night sky

33:38.175 --> 33:40.775
by a flight crew preparing for descent.

33:43.147 --> 33:47.082
Xiaoshan Airport is one
of the largest in China.

33:47.117 --> 33:49.117
And that's very important.

33:49.153 --> 33:51.319
It's a very busy airport.

33:51.355 --> 33:55.056
What happened on July 7 is that

33:55.092 --> 33:57.359
a pilot from an incoming
passenger airplane

33:57.394 --> 34:00.395
noticed something very unusual
coming towards him.

34:00.430 --> 34:02.764
He notified the ground crew

34:02.799 --> 34:05.667
and the airport was shut down

34:05.702 --> 34:09.670
because a comet-like object

34:09.706 --> 34:12.139
was basically speeding
towards the airport.

34:13.777 --> 34:16.311
There was a trail behind it.

34:16.346 --> 34:19.214
It was a glowing, oval-shaped object.

34:19.248 --> 34:22.784
The object was also
witnessed and photographed

34:22.819 --> 34:26.588
by numerous Hangzhou residents.

34:26.623 --> 34:30.125
When the UFO was seen,
all hell broke loose.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.427
Flights were diverted.

34:32.462 --> 34:34.228
The military was contacted

34:34.264 --> 34:36.598
to see if they were test-flying
anything in the air,

34:36.632 --> 34:38.433
which they weren't.

34:38.467 --> 34:42.337
This is the third such incident
in five years in China

34:42.371 --> 34:46.241
where the presence of a UFO
has either shut down an airport

34:46.275 --> 34:51.713
or caused havoc and amazement
amongst the populus.

34:51.748 --> 34:54.081
And it's clearly something
that the Chinese government

34:54.117 --> 34:56.384
want to shut down and play down.

34:56.420 --> 34:59.888
It could also be due to the fact
that the Chinese have realized

34:59.923 --> 35:03.491
they're not in control of their
airspace, somebody else is.

35:05.429 --> 35:09.364
The Xiaoshan event is only
one of the events of this kind.

35:09.399 --> 35:13.401
The same thing happened
in Guizhou Province.

35:13.437 --> 35:17.472
At that time, the pilots were
instructed to avoid the UFO,

35:17.507 --> 35:19.741
ground their aircrafts

35:19.776 --> 35:22.377
and return to the air after the event,

35:22.412 --> 35:25.180
which can provide evidence
of the existence

35:25.215 --> 35:27.215
of the UFO phenomenon.

35:30.854 --> 35:32.887
While many in the United States

35:32.923 --> 35:36.791
view the UFO phenomenon
as distinctly American,

35:36.827 --> 35:38.793
recent surveys have shown

35:38.829 --> 35:42.664
that roughly half of the
1.4 billion Chinese people

35:42.699 --> 35:47.235
believe in UFOs and
extraterrestrial life.

35:47.271 --> 35:50.305
And ancient astronaut theorists suggest

35:50.340 --> 35:53.308
that despite the Chinese
government's dismissal

35:53.343 --> 35:55.677
of recent UFO events,

35:55.712 --> 35:57.579
it now appears

35:57.614 --> 35:59.814
they too are taking an interest

35:59.850 --> 36:03.285
in otherworldly phenomena.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.954
It's incredibly popular
in China to be a member

36:05.989 --> 36:08.890
of a UFO community that's
trying to make contact

36:08.925 --> 36:11.226
with extraterrestrial beings.

36:11.261 --> 36:13.962
The Chinese government
is closely monitoring this

36:13.997 --> 36:16.398
and in fact they're financing
some of these research groups.

36:17.934 --> 36:19.901
So, one wonders,

36:19.936 --> 36:22.170
is the Chinese government
starting to view

36:22.205 --> 36:24.005
our contact with extraterrestrial beings

36:24.041 --> 36:26.474
as something simply too strong to deny?

36:26.510 --> 36:30.979
Could recent events be
forcing the Chinese government

36:31.014 --> 36:33.882
to take a greater interest
in examining possible

36:33.917 --> 36:36.451
extraterrestrial encounters?

36:36.486 --> 36:41.222
Encounters that they have
secretly known about for years?

36:41.258 --> 36:44.592
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes

36:44.628 --> 36:48.463
and suggest that China's
effort to manufacture

36:48.498 --> 36:51.433
the world's largest radio telescope

36:51.468 --> 36:56.304
is an explicit mission towards
the search for alien life.

36:58.500 --> 36:59.000
_

37:03.788 --> 37:06.522
Guizhou Province, China.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.458
2011.

37:10.729 --> 37:14.898
Construction commences
on a massive engineering

37:14.933 --> 37:17.400
and scientific endeavor.

37:17.435 --> 37:22.605
A 500-meter telescope,
also known as FAST.

37:22.641 --> 37:28.344
Nan Rendong, chief scientist
of the FAST project states,

37:28.380 --> 37:32.048
"A radio telescope is
like a sensitive ear,

37:32.083 --> 37:35.818
separating radio messages from
white noise in the universe."

37:38.023 --> 37:40.590
The Chinese government
is currently constructing

37:40.625 --> 37:44.727
what will be the largest radio
telescope anywhere in the world.

37:44.763 --> 37:49.465
The reflector dish will be
500 meters in diameter

37:49.501 --> 37:54.137
and this will dwarf any
other comparable facility.

37:54.172 --> 37:58.474
It will be the best piece of
equipment for 20 or 30 years

37:58.510 --> 38:01.044
when it comes to radio astronomy.

38:04.749 --> 38:06.683
Ancient astronaut theorists

38:06.718 --> 38:10.086
point to the construction
of this behemoth telescope

38:10.121 --> 38:15.191
as proof that China is deeply
interested in extraterrestrials.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.929
Do they know there are aliens out there?

38:19.965 --> 38:21.831
Are they trying to get absolute,

38:21.866 --> 38:24.434
verifiable proof positive

38:24.469 --> 38:28.037
and be the first nation to disclose?

38:28.073 --> 38:31.607
The Chinese government
was very clear in stating

38:31.643 --> 38:35.078
that this dish was built specifically

38:35.113 --> 38:37.780
for the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.249
So then the question arises,

38:40.285 --> 38:43.419
are they merely following up
on their history?

38:43.455 --> 38:45.655
Because China,

38:45.690 --> 38:48.891
as with every other ancient culture,

38:48.927 --> 38:51.260
was visited by extraterrestrials.

38:54.099 --> 38:57.100
What is their interest
in exploring deep space?

39:00.939 --> 39:04.273
The telescope was completed
in July of 2016

39:04.309 --> 39:07.443
and is regarded as a giant leap forward

39:07.479 --> 39:10.546
with unprecedented precision
that will allow

39:10.582 --> 39:14.417
the Chinese government to
survey not only the Milky Way

39:14.452 --> 39:16.686
but also distant galaxies

39:16.721 --> 39:20.490
for radio signals and signs of life.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.092
While many other nations
are currently designing

39:23.128 --> 39:26.562
or constructing
advanced radio telescopes,

39:26.598 --> 39:29.899
none will surpass
the size and capability

39:29.934 --> 39:32.135
of the FAST telescope.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.871
Wu Xiangping, director-general

39:34.906 --> 39:39.175
of the Chinese Astronomical
Society, declared,

39:39.210 --> 39:41.811
"It will help us to search
for intelligent life

39:41.846 --> 39:44.180
"outside the galaxy

39:44.215 --> 39:47.250
and explore the origins of the universe."

39:47.285 --> 39:51.120
Out there somewhere might civilizations

39:51.156 --> 39:54.991
be posting scientific
and technical information

39:55.026 --> 39:56.526
that they've discovered?

39:56.561 --> 40:01.464
And the first nation
to download this information

40:01.499 --> 40:03.833
will have a huge advantage.

40:03.868 --> 40:06.135
They'll be the dominant
force on this planet

40:06.171 --> 40:08.004
for the foreseeable future.

40:08.039 --> 40:10.139
Do the Chinese want to be first?

40:10.175 --> 40:12.141
Do they know it's out there?

40:12.177 --> 40:14.310
And is this radio telescope

40:14.345 --> 40:17.213
an attempt to go and
get that information?

40:20.318 --> 40:23.319
I think it's good and
encouraging that our country

40:23.354 --> 40:26.722
is constructing such a huge telescope.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.058
It will help to find aliens

40:29.094 --> 40:31.160
and alien civilization.

40:34.532 --> 40:36.199
For thousands of years,

40:36.234 --> 40:39.769
Chinese people have collected
reports about UFO encounters

40:39.804 --> 40:42.271
and have recorded them.

40:42.307 --> 40:46.109
And those who studied
are amazed at the accuracy

40:46.144 --> 40:49.545
and just the sheer wealth
of the UFO information

40:49.581 --> 40:52.215
coming from China,
and I hope this will continue.

40:52.250 --> 40:55.985
As China slowly opens its doors,

40:56.020 --> 40:59.255
is it possible that we'll
encounter that the stories

40:59.290 --> 41:02.325
of the Yellow Emperor are in fact true?

41:02.360 --> 41:05.661
That they were visited
by extraterrestrial beings

41:05.697 --> 41:07.230
in the remote past?

41:07.265 --> 41:09.365
Only time will tell.

41:11.069 --> 41:13.169
Could it be that China

41:13.204 --> 41:15.872
is building the world's
largest radio telescope

41:15.907 --> 41:20.176
not in hopes of finding proof
of alien life in the universe

41:20.211 --> 41:25.081
but in order to welcome new
messages from extraterrestrials

41:25.116 --> 41:27.583
that have been visiting China
for thousands of years?

41:30.355 --> 41:32.955
And could stories of flying dragons,

41:32.991 --> 41:34.357
Yellow Emperors,

41:34.392 --> 41:37.927
and the existence of strange,
secret pyramids

41:37.962 --> 41:41.063
be the proof that
ancient astronaut theorists

41:41.099 --> 41:42.765
have been looking for?

41:42.800 --> 41:45.701
One thing is certain--

41:45.737 --> 41:50.139
the evidence of extraterrestrial
contact is mounting.

41:50.175 --> 41:52.041
And the ultimate close encounter

41:52.076 --> 41:53.242
could soon happen

41:53.278 --> 41:55.711
right before our eyes.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
