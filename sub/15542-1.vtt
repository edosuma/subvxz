WEBVTT

00:25.291 --> 00:26.992
- How's it going there guys?

00:26.994 --> 00:28.427
So just recently i
saw a film called

00:28.429 --> 00:31.363
2 Jennifer and it is directed
by James Cullen bressack

00:31.365 --> 00:33.932
and I actually have
the DVD copy right here

00:33.934 --> 00:36.368
signed by him, James is
like a really awesome guy

00:36.370 --> 00:38.404
and what he did here
was he created a

00:38.406 --> 00:40.305
pretty awesome
movie if you ask me.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.341
I do highly recommend
that you check out

00:42.343 --> 00:44.910
2 Jennifer and there
is an ice cream truck

00:44.912 --> 00:46.211
driving by my house right now.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.982
- I found this movie
actually laugh out loud

00:49.984 --> 00:54.253
hilarious, but at times it
was also quite frightening

00:54.255 --> 00:56.355
because it really
hit home for me.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.624
- It's not you know

00:58.626 --> 01:01.693
balls to the wall Gore
or anything like that,

01:01.695 --> 01:03.996
it's just the idea is

01:03.998 --> 01:06.098
it's real.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.233
- It's this horror movie

01:08.235 --> 01:10.135
all shot in iPhone,

01:10.137 --> 01:13.005
and I can barely make
calls on my iPhone.

01:13.007 --> 01:15.674
So color me impressed.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.610
- Dude that movie
is crazy scary.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.181
I heard it's based
on a real chick

01:22.183 --> 01:23.916
and everything man.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.951
- Yeah I saw that movie

01:25.953 --> 01:27.853
I thought it was
fucking bullshit.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.055
Who shoots a movie on an iPhone?

01:30.057 --> 01:31.990
Can you not afford
a real camera?

01:33.193 --> 01:36.328
- Cheeseheads from
Wisconsin love three things,

01:36.330 --> 01:38.030
horror movies,

01:38.032 --> 01:39.598
cheese,

01:39.600 --> 01:41.033
beer.

01:41.035 --> 01:43.368
2 Jennifer was one of 'em.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.804
- I wonder if James
Cullen bressack

01:45.806 --> 01:47.406
will ever do a sequel.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.509
- I'm not personally
gonna do a sequel

01:50.511 --> 01:52.377
but I definitely would be open

01:52.379 --> 01:54.179
to somebody else doing one,

01:54.181 --> 01:55.514
like one of my
friends or something,

01:55.516 --> 01:56.915
you know I know a lot of
really talented filmmakers

01:56.917 --> 02:01.320
and I think it's a
story that can be told.

02:19.005 --> 02:20.672
- Hey Jennifer.

02:22.242 --> 02:27.079
You don't-
you don't know me yet,

02:27.081 --> 02:30.782
and actually i
don't even know you.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.086
I uh...

02:34.088 --> 02:36.488
I don't even know
what you look like,

02:36.490 --> 02:39.491
but at the same time
i feel like I've

02:40.360 --> 02:42.794
known you forever.

02:43.463 --> 02:45.697
Known you my whole life.

02:46.866 --> 02:49.535
I know that sounds crazy.

02:50.370 --> 02:53.071
Let me start over.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.207
My name is Spencer

02:55.209 --> 02:58.410
and I'm making a movie.

02:59.512 --> 03:03.081
And, I want you Jennifer

03:03.083 --> 03:04.950
to be the star.

03:06.119 --> 03:09.321
It's a sequel to a movie

03:09.323 --> 03:11.790
that I really enjoyed

03:11.792 --> 03:13.625
a movie that

03:13.627 --> 03:15.961
inspired me in a way to

03:15.963 --> 03:19.798
start this journey
to come and find you.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.467
It's written by

03:22.469 --> 03:27.272
a good friend of mine
named James in Los Angeles,

03:27.274 --> 03:30.809
and he wants me to
direct the sequel.

03:32.612 --> 03:35.881
It's called 2 Jennifer.

03:36.950 --> 03:41.186
And, it's gonna be
something really special

03:41.188 --> 03:43.455
for you and me.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.625
Jennifer,

03:48.294 --> 03:50.696
I can't wait to
finally meet you.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.068
I'll see you soon.

03:59.372 --> 04:01.640
All right mack,

04:02.342 --> 04:06.578
let's do this thing.

04:16.923 --> 04:17.656
- Hello?

04:17.658 --> 04:19.057
- Hey mack what's going on man?

04:19.059 --> 04:20.091
This is Spencer.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.261
- Hey Spencer
what's going on man?

04:22.263 --> 04:24.429
- Nothing man, nothing
i was just callin'

04:24.431 --> 04:28.300
to see if you were still
down to help me with this

04:28.302 --> 04:31.036
2 Jennifer project.

04:31.038 --> 04:31.770
- You know it dude

04:31.772 --> 04:32.971

04:32.973 --> 04:34.306
- No, you know dude

04:34.308 --> 04:36.708
some stuff kinda changed
on my end of things,

04:36.710 --> 04:39.578
and you know James
wants to move up

04:39.580 --> 04:41.680
the production, so it looks like

04:41.682 --> 04:44.216
I'm actually gonna be
coming out tomorrow.

04:44.218 --> 04:46.718
My flight lands at 10 am

04:46.720 --> 04:49.388
in lax, so I was calling to see

04:49.390 --> 04:53.258
if you were down to start
this thing right away

04:53.260 --> 04:54.660
I guess.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.396
- Um, did
you just say tomorrow?

04:57.398 --> 04:58.997
I have to work,

04:58.999 --> 05:01.066
why is James moving
up the production?

05:01.068 --> 05:02.267
- Look, I don't know,

05:02.269 --> 05:03.302
I just got off
the phone with him

05:03.304 --> 05:04.569
and he wants to
push everything up

05:04.571 --> 05:07.172
and if I'm not there
tomorrow he's gonna

05:07.174 --> 05:08.807
pass this off to
somebody else and

05:08.809 --> 05:11.310

really big opportunity

05:11.312 --> 05:13.745
for both of us so,

05:13.747 --> 05:17.115
I gotta be there man i

hell are you gonna

05:20.321 --> 05:21.820

05:21.822 --> 05:23.422
I mean do you have
a finished script?

05:23.424 --> 05:25.190
Do you know who's
gonna be in it?

05:25.192 --> 05:26.992

And James is handling

Your name isn't

I'm negotiating a red
epic package actually

11:57.517 --> 11:59.484

film on it'll be great.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.685
- Awesome.

12:00.687 --> 12:01.653

watch an iPhone movie.

12:01.655 --> 12:02.787
Just not gonna happen at all.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.756
- Awesome man.

12:31.818 --> 12:32.751
- Well, I mean

12:32.753 --> 12:33.685
if it's an issue I'll throw 'em

12:33.687 --> 12:34.853
some cash or something.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.121
- It's all right.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.288
- Okay, cool,
so they're cool then.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.890
- Yeah I mean
they're interesting,

12:38.892 --> 12:39.924
they're interesting cats.

12:39.926 --> 12:40.859
- Okay, yeah.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.494
- One of them's got like

12:42.496 --> 12:44.529
fruit tendencies and
he's I don't know,

12:44.531 --> 12:45.964
like a vampire or something

12:45.966 --> 12:47.298
I don't know what's going on.
- What?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.567
- Yeah, you'll see, it's weird.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.568
- He's weird huh?

12:50.570 --> 12:51.669
- Yeah the other one's a,

12:51.671 --> 12:52.704
it's actually it's interesting

12:52.706 --> 12:54.005
he's a philanthropist
or something

12:54.007 --> 12:55.039
he's bringing renewable energy

12:55.041 --> 12:56.741
to impoverished nations or--

12:56.743 --> 12:57.642
- shut up.

12:57.644 --> 12:58.777
Who fucking does that?

12:58.779 --> 13:00.078
- I think he's bringing
them in cyclones,

13:00.080 --> 13:01.379
like he's sending cyclones

13:01.381 --> 13:03.681
with food packages
or energy fields

13:03.683 --> 13:04.649
or something.

13:04.651 --> 13:07.152
- Dude it all goes over my head,
i think that's what it is.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.653
I may not be correct.

13:08.655 --> 13:09.888
- That's crazy.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.724
- But yeah dude, so
we'll just run it by them

13:12.726 --> 13:13.825
hopefully they're cool with it.

13:13.827 --> 13:14.659
- Yeah.

13:14.661 --> 13:15.827
- And I also had a thought

13:15.829 --> 13:17.829
for who we can cast
as Jennifer actually.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.798
- What
are you thinking?

13:19.800 --> 13:20.865
- I have a friend

13:20.867 --> 13:22.000
who's classically trained,

13:22.002 --> 13:23.902
just an amazing actress,

13:23.904 --> 13:25.236
I think she'd kill it man.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.137
- What's her name?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.739
- Name's Emily bates.

13:27.741 --> 13:28.907
- Well,

13:28.909 --> 13:31.509
mack we can't cast Emily bates

13:31.511 --> 13:33.411
as Jennifer.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.213
- Why can't we?

13:35.215 --> 13:39.884
- Because we're
looking for jennifers mack,

13:39.886 --> 13:41.653
we have to cast a Jennifer

13:41.655 --> 13:43.855
to play Jennifer or it's
not gonna make any sense.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.089
- We don't have to do
that, it's a movie,

13:45.091 --> 13:46.090
we can cast whoever we want

13:46.092 --> 13:47.525
and they go play Jennifer.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.927
- No, mack
you're not getting me,

13:48.929 --> 13:50.762
we have to find a Jennifer,

13:50.764 --> 13:53.064
cast a Jennifer
to play Jennifer,

13:53.066 --> 13:54.566
I mean it's how the--

13:54.568 --> 13:55.967
- why, do you think Jennifer
Aniston only plays jennifers?

13:55.969 --> 13:57.468
Do you think gilda
radner only plays gildas?

13:57.470 --> 13:58.536
No, they don't.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.437
- Mack,
the movie's not called

13:59.439 --> 14:01.039
2 Emily bates,

14:01.041 --> 14:02.807
it's called 2 Jennifer.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.442
We have to cast a Jennifer

14:04.444 --> 14:06.845
to play Jennifer, that's
the way James wants it,

14:06.847 --> 14:08.112
it's gonna help
us sell the movie.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.547
- Dude sounds like a diva

14:09.549 --> 14:10.782
if that's what he wants.

14:10.784 --> 14:12.817
- Don't say
that, he's not a diva,

14:12.819 --> 14:14.085
he's a really really great guy,

14:14.087 --> 14:17.021
and we have to
kinda roll with it

14:17.023 --> 14:18.256
because that's what he wants

14:18.258 --> 14:19.257
and that's just
how it's gotta be.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.391
That's just how it's gotta be.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.226
- Well that's how it's gotta be

14:21.228 --> 14:22.160
that's how it's gotta be

14:22.162 --> 14:23.561
I don't know what I can else

14:23.563 --> 14:24.596
what else I can say.

14:24.598 --> 14:26.064
It's gonna be your job
to find a Jennifer.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.232
- This is los
Angeles, there's 1,000

14:27.234 --> 14:28.633

18:40.120 --> 18:41.352
- Yeah, you're
overthinking it man.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.854
We gotta take this
one step at a time,

18:42.856 --> 18:44.188
step number one

18:44.190 --> 18:47.058
is we find our
damn Jennifer man.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.926
Once we find the Jennifer then

18:48.928 --> 18:52.263
everything is gonna
fall into place here,

18:52.265 --> 18:55.233
so everything else will
take care of itself,

18:55.235 --> 18:58.102
let's just find the
perfect Jennifer.

18:58.104 --> 18:59.137
You know?

18:59.139 --> 19:00.705
- Spence, uh,

19:00.707 --> 19:04.041
I love that you're out
here man, it's great,

19:04.043 --> 19:07.111
and I think that it's great
that we're doing this, okay?

19:07.113 --> 19:09.213
But I've been out
here doing this for

19:09.215 --> 19:10.715
a little bit longer
than you and I may know

19:10.717 --> 19:14.852
a bit more about how to launch
a production of this scale.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.822
Okay, and I think to
make this production

19:17.824 --> 19:19.290
the best that it can be,

19:19.292 --> 19:21.425
I'm gonna really need
you to get me in touch

19:21.427 --> 19:23.261
with James, all right
that's very important,

19:23.263 --> 19:25.329
we're right behind,
and you're rushing.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.564
- Dude dude--

19:26.566 --> 19:27.598
- okay we're rushing this, okay?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.066
- I already told you,

19:29.068 --> 19:31.002
James is gonna be at the
casting session tomorrow man

19:31.004 --> 19:32.904
we just lock the Jennifer,
we can talk to James

19:32.906 --> 19:36.507
at the session tomorrow
and you can figure out

19:36.509 --> 19:37.775
whatever it is you
need to figure out.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.110
- Whatever it is i
need to figure out?

19:39.112 --> 19:40.311
- Yeah.
- No dude, I need to

19:40.313 --> 19:41.979
talk to James tonight,
this is important.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.080
- Hey, dude, dude,

19:43.082 --> 19:44.448
you're way too stressed.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.083
- No I am not way too stressed.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.251
- Yeah,
you're way too--

19:47.253 --> 19:48.486
- all right no, I'm
not, listen to me man,

19:48.488 --> 19:50.188
I'm in hot water at
work because of this.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.422
Okay?

19:51.424 --> 19:53.491
I'm not in a good
place right now.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.159
And we are behind on this.

19:55.161 --> 19:57.261
And if this doesn't work out,

19:57.263 --> 19:59.130
if this all falls
apart, I'm the one who's

19:59.132 --> 20:01.032
gonna be really pissed, okay?

20:01.034 --> 20:02.466
Do you get this?

20:06.505 --> 20:08.739
Where the fuck are you going?

20:11.276 --> 20:12.610
- Check it out.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.081
I got Tequila.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.282
- No dude--

20:18.284 --> 20:20.184
- you
need a fucking shot

20:20.186 --> 20:21.419
to cool your jets bro.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.920
- I don't do Tequila.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.055
- You're way too
stressed about this man,

20:24.057 --> 20:25.189
come on, let's do a shot.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.358
Let's do a damn shot my man.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.159
- Dude.

20:28.161 --> 20:29.860

20:29.862 --> 20:31.495
You know I got the
jennifers dude,

20:31.497 --> 20:33.197

20:33.199 --> 20:35.333
Come on, come on.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.001
Where are your god
damn shot glasses?

20:37.003 --> 20:37.935
- In the cabinet.

20:37.937 --> 20:38.669
- This one?

20:38.671 --> 20:39.437
- No no I'll get 'em.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.072
- Jesus Christ.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.540
Nice.

20:43.342 --> 20:45.643
You know I got this man.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.278
I did not come all
the way out here

20:47.280 --> 20:48.412
to fuck you dude.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.380
- Am I pouring these?

20:49.382 --> 20:50.381
- Yes, pour 'em man.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.984
- I hope not.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.118
Seriously I hope not.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.753
- Dude, I got this.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.188
We're gonna take care of this.

20:57.190 --> 20:59.790
I'm not gonna let you down bro,

20:59.792 --> 21:01.359
I would never do
that to you bro.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.860
- All right.

21:02.862 --> 21:03.894
- For real, i
would never do that to you.

21:03.896 --> 21:04.729
- All right, yeah great,

21:04.731 --> 21:06.330
here you're taking this big one,

21:06.332 --> 21:08.466
I don't take Tequila well.

21:09.234 --> 21:10.635
To Jennifer, okay?

21:10.637 --> 21:11.602
- To Jennifer.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.038
- Look, imagine that everything

21:14.040 --> 21:15.640
in this room is an atom.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.108
Everything that you see,

21:17.110 --> 21:18.476
everything you touch.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.312
This table is an atom right?

21:21.314 --> 21:22.913
That ceiling fan is an atom,

21:22.915 --> 21:24.815
and the TV,

21:24.817 --> 21:26.217
I'm an atom.

21:26.219 --> 21:27.351
- You're an atom, okay.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.053
- Well I'm a Charlie,

21:29.055 --> 21:30.488
but you knew that.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.323
That's not what
i mean, but then,

21:32.325 --> 21:36.227
it's like this tornado
comes in right?

21:36.229 --> 21:38.663
And it starts to mix
everything around

21:38.665 --> 21:40.965
it just spins and
spins and spins

21:40.967 --> 21:41.966
like really really fast,

21:41.968 --> 21:43.701
like faster than
the speed of light.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.536
- That's like a
fuckin' strong tornado man.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.071
- Yeah that's some wizard
of oz shit right there.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.239
- That's some
wizard of oz shit dude.

21:48.241 --> 21:49.874
- That's some wizard of oz shit?

21:49.876 --> 21:52.076
- Do do do do do!

21:53.245 --> 21:55.946
- Exactly, exactly, but imagine

21:55.948 --> 21:58.616
what we could do if we
could harness the power

21:58.618 --> 22:01.686
of that, look, guys,

22:01.688 --> 22:04.622
I've been to east Asia,

22:04.624 --> 22:06.190
we've been going to India.

22:06.192 --> 22:08.359
I mean I wanna take the team

22:08.361 --> 22:10.027
you know to other
parts of the world.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.163
Like wherever we can
make a real difference,

22:12.165 --> 22:13.364
I mean with what we can do.

22:13.366 --> 22:14.532
I'm just trying to explain,

22:14.534 --> 22:16.367
'cause I know you're getting me,

22:16.369 --> 22:17.435
like you could
make a difference.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.869
I mean, even I mean dude

22:18.871 --> 22:20.538
you've been visiting us whatever

22:20.540 --> 22:22.340
but you could make a
difference you know?

22:22.342 --> 22:23.541
And I just--

22:23.543 --> 22:26.210
- all right, hey, i
could make a difference.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.111
- You can make a difference.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.413
- You could bring a
tornado to east Asia.

22:29.415 --> 22:31.349
- All right,
well where are the

22:31.351 --> 22:32.950
fucking flying monkeys dude?

22:32.952 --> 22:34.385
- Yeah where are those
flying monkeys at?

22:34.387 --> 22:35.186
- Where are the
god damn monkeys?

22:35.188 --> 22:36.420
- Oh, hey Dennis!

22:36.422 --> 22:37.888

22:54.774 --> 22:56.774

22:56.776 --> 22:58.209

23:16.462 --> 23:17.428

26:05.865 --> 26:06.530
- You'll survive dude

26:06.532 --> 26:07.798
you'll survive.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.400
I just texted some
of the jennifers,

26:09.402 --> 26:11.669
I let 'em know we're
running a little bit late.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.737
I texted James I haven't
heard back from him,

26:13.739 --> 26:15.606
hopefully he's just
meeting us there.

26:15.608 --> 26:17.374
- Cool, cool.

26:17.376 --> 26:18.375
- You excited?

26:18.377 --> 26:19.710
- I'm excited to go back to bed.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.979
- Yeah we'll
get you there dude.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.114
- I just hope some of
these jennifers can act.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.583
- Yeah she's there,

26:25.585 --> 26:27.151
she's there.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.687
- Oh my god, no one's here yet.

26:29.689 --> 26:32.590
Good, except for all
the actresses, you know?

26:32.592 --> 26:33.757
- The
first one texted me

26:33.759 --> 26:35.526
she's gonna be
here any minute so.

26:35.528 --> 26:36.660
- That's great.

26:36.662 --> 26:38.128
- Get used to this.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.698
- All right man I think
it's your call dude,

26:40.700 --> 26:42.566
we have six actresses out there

26:42.568 --> 26:43.667
and he hasn't so much
as called us yet,

26:43.669 --> 26:44.602
what do you wanna do?

26:44.604 --> 26:45.603
- I don't know,

26:45.605 --> 26:46.537
I've texted him,
I've called him,

26:46.539 --> 26:47.538
I have no idea where he is dude,

26:47.540 --> 26:49.540
let's what do you think?

26:49.542 --> 26:50.574
Should we just
start without him?

26:50.576 --> 26:51.942
- It's up to you dude,

26:51.944 --> 26:53.143
I mean he's the one who
rushed the production forward,

26:53.145 --> 26:54.545
and you know he
hasn't even shown up

26:54.547 --> 26:56.080
at our audition day,

26:56.082 --> 26:57.715
so yeah do you wanna pull
the trigger on this thing

26:57.717 --> 26:59.149
I say let's do it,
we can handle it.

27:00.018 --> 27:02.653
- Please, you don't
have to do this,

27:02.655 --> 27:05.255
you can just let me go!

27:05.257 --> 27:07.558
- Now why
would I go and do that?

27:07.560 --> 27:11.462
- Michael, you're not right,

27:11.464 --> 27:12.763
I can give you help,

27:12.765 --> 27:14.565
we can make this right.

- Right?

27:15.701 --> 27:16.634
Jennifer the only way
to make this right

30:53.452 --> 30:55.385

- No no no please
don't don't don't.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.562

You can let me go.

36:03.829 --> 36:08.398

36:17.176 --> 36:19.142
Jennifer the only
way you can help me

36:19.144 --> 36:25.148
is for me to kill you.

36:25.150 --> 36:28.051
- Please just leave me alone!

36:28.053 --> 36:29.786
You'll never get away with this!

36:29.788 --> 36:32.956

get away with it Jennifer.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.859
That's never been the plan.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.894
- Then what is it then?

36:37.896 --> 36:39.329
What do you want from me?

36:39.331 --> 36:42.332
- I want to slice
you open Jennifer,

36:42.334 --> 36:46.236

some one on one with her,

40:48.680 --> 40:49.946

would like to get to know her.

41:03.462 --> 41:05.495

41:06.832 --> 41:09.466
I mean that professionally,
give me some credit here.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.901

46:43.902 --> 46:45.668
What the fuck do
you mean feminine?

46:45.670 --> 46:46.602
- I mean she's feminine,

46:46.604 --> 46:49.505
she has soft ladylike features

46:49.507 --> 46:51.541
that are nice you know?

46:51.543 --> 46:53.576
- You got fucking weird
since high school bro,

46:53.578 --> 46:55.778
I'm serious dude, i
don't know what you mean.

46:55.780 --> 46:56.813
Is she cute?

46:56.815 --> 46:58.314
Is that what you're
trying to say?

46:58.316 --> 46:59.549
I don't understand what
you're trying to say here.

46:59.551 --> 47:00.783
- Oh I mean
she's feminine dude,

47:00.785 --> 47:01.818
it's nice to call
a girl feminine,

47:01.820 --> 47:03.920
like it's a compliment.

47:03.922 --> 47:05.688
- Okay, sure.

47:05.690 --> 47:07.023
That sounds great,

47:07.025 --> 47:08.291
hey turn right, turn right,
turn right right right.

47:08.293 --> 47:09.725
All right man this is the place

47:09.727 --> 47:10.760
do you have the
apartment number?

47:10.762 --> 47:11.861
- Yeah she texted me,

47:11.863 --> 47:14.597
she said it's 32 i
think, second floor.

47:14.599 --> 47:15.398
- Yep, okay.

47:15.400 --> 47:20.102
- Yeah.

47:20.104 --> 47:22.972
You gonna be able to
see without those?

47:22.974 --> 47:25.107
- Yeah why not?

47:25.109 --> 47:29.011
- Whatever
dude Jesus Christ.

47:29.013 --> 47:30.847
- So I just finished reading
the script last night.

47:30.849 --> 47:33.216
I really like it,

47:33.218 --> 47:34.483
I think it's gonna
be a scary film.

47:34.485 --> 47:35.885
- Yeah it's
super twisted.

47:35.887 --> 47:36.819
- Yeah we're gonna try to

47:36.821 --> 47:38.087
make a fucked up movie for sure.

47:38.089 --> 47:40.590
So Jennifer what I'd
like to do with you today

47:40.592 --> 47:43.259
is kind of go through
some of the bigger scenes

47:43.261 --> 47:44.861
that are in the story,

47:44.863 --> 47:46.095
and really get a feel for 'em.

47:46.097 --> 47:47.797
James is handling all
the rest of the casting,

47:47.799 --> 47:50.967
so really we're just going to

47:50.969 --> 47:52.835
discuss your character
and try to find some

47:52.837 --> 47:54.036
fun stuff with it.

47:54.038 --> 47:54.837
- Okay.
- If that's cool with you.

47:54.839 --> 47:56.038
- Yeah, of course.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.073
- Cool.
- Absolutely.

47:57.075 --> 47:58.507
Will I be reading with you?

47:58.509 --> 47:59.609
- No we'll actually

47:59.611 --> 48:02.678
I'd like to film it
if you don't mind,

48:02.680 --> 48:04.647
I'd like to make sure
you look great on camera.

48:04.649 --> 48:08.551
Mack do you mind reading
with Jennifer for this?

48:08.553 --> 48:09.986
- No.

48:09.988 --> 48:10.987
- Is that cool?

48:10.989 --> 48:12.521
Let me have this guy.

48:12.523 --> 48:13.689
Yeah.

48:13.691 --> 48:14.657
Mack's not an actor,

48:14.659 --> 48:15.658
he'll do his best.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.660
- Yeah you guys
ready to get started?

48:17.662 --> 48:18.828
- Yeah.

48:18.830 --> 48:19.495
- Sure, do you
guys want any water

48:19.497 --> 48:20.263
or anything?

48:20.265 --> 48:22.765
- I'd love a water.

48:22.767 --> 48:25.301
- If that's cool.
- Cool, Spencer?

48:25.303 --> 48:26.402
- Yeah sure,
that sounds fine.

48:26.404 --> 48:27.436
- Cool.

48:27.438 --> 48:29.138
So I was talking
to Jody last night

48:29.140 --> 48:31.007
actually and,

48:31.009 --> 48:32.508
he's gonna come over tonight

48:32.510 --> 48:34.176
and watch the original
Jennifer movie.

48:34.178 --> 48:35.645
- Oh okay.

48:35.647 --> 48:37.546
- Yeah,
that's gonna be fun.

48:37.548 --> 48:38.614
- Awesome.

48:38.616 --> 48:39.649
- You guys
are more than welcome

48:39.651 --> 48:40.917
to join.

48:40.919 --> 48:42.852
- Well, we'll
have to play it by ear.

48:42.854 --> 48:44.887
- Great, actually
we were hoping to

48:44.889 --> 48:45.922
get in touch with Jody

48:45.924 --> 48:47.123
to be a part of this movie.

48:47.125 --> 48:48.791
That was what we were

48:48.793 --> 48:49.725
kind of excited about.

48:49.727 --> 48:50.693
- Cool, yeah,

48:50.695 --> 48:51.594
I'll be sure to tell him.

48:51.596 --> 48:52.628
- Great yeah.

48:52.630 --> 48:53.829
- Yeah I mean
we have to check with

48:53.831 --> 48:54.864
James first, so, let's not--

48:54.866 --> 48:55.998
- we don't have to
check with James

48:56.000 --> 48:57.233
I mean he's pretty much been

48:57.235 --> 48:58.601
incommunicado this whole time

48:58.603 --> 49:00.803
so I think we can make
the decision ourselves.

49:00.805 --> 49:02.505
- Oh well I can

49:02.507 --> 49:05.107
text Jody and he can get a
hold of James for you guys.

49:05.109 --> 49:06.309
- Yeah.

49:06.311 --> 49:08.010
- That's
not necessary.

49:08.012 --> 49:09.612
- No, let's
definitely do that,

49:09.614 --> 49:10.713
it sounds very necessary.

49:10.715 --> 49:11.914
- That's--

49:11.916 --> 49:12.915
- it's
not a problem at all,

49:12.917 --> 49:14.784
I can do it right now.

49:14.786 --> 49:16.419
- No Jennifer
it's not a big deal,

49:16.421 --> 49:18.354
we can get in touch
with him fine,

49:18.356 --> 49:20.056
it's nothing to worry about.

49:20.058 --> 49:21.123
- Yeah.

49:21.125 --> 49:22.124
- Awesome.

49:22.126 --> 49:26.362
When you're ready.

49:26.364 --> 49:27.496
- Michael it's been a while--

49:27.498 --> 49:28.664
- yes.

49:28.666 --> 49:29.932
Can I come in?

49:32.036 --> 49:36.372
- I'm sorry.

49:36.374 --> 49:38.074
Michael it's been a while.

49:38.076 --> 49:40.609
- Yes, can I come in?

49:45.183 --> 49:46.649
- Michael it's been a while.

49:46.651 --> 49:48.985
- Yes, can I come in?

49:48.987 --> 49:50.186
- I don't think
that's a good idea,

49:50.188 --> 49:51.120
my parents--

49:51.122 --> 49:52.154
- your parents don't know shit,

49:52.156 --> 49:54.023
you know that.

49:54.025 --> 49:55.424
- I have to ask,

49:55.426 --> 49:57.093
did you kill that girl?

49:57.095 --> 49:58.995
Did you kill Jennifer?

49:58.997 --> 49:59.929
- Of course not,

49:59.931 --> 50:01.230
how could you even ask that?

50:01.232 --> 50:03.799
I thought you loved me?

50:03.801 --> 50:05.134
- There was a time.

50:05.136 --> 50:07.870
A long time ago.

50:07.872 --> 50:09.305
- Oh I missed you Jennifer.

50:09.307 --> 50:11.807
I missed you so so much.

50:11.809 --> 50:14.410
- I missed you too.

50:14.412 --> 50:21.017
So much.

50:21.019 --> 50:22.752
Wait can we try something?

50:22.754 --> 50:25.054
I'm just feeling--

50:25.056 --> 50:26.288
- what?

50:26.290 --> 50:27.957
- I have an idea.

50:27.959 --> 50:28.991
Okay just--

50:28.993 --> 50:30.693
- he's
not playing the role

50:30.695 --> 50:33.195
in real life so.

50:33.197 --> 50:35.965
- I have to ask,

50:35.967 --> 50:39.869
did you kill that
girl, Jennifer?

50:39.871 --> 50:42.338
- Of course not.

50:42.340 --> 50:44.974
How could you even ask that?

50:44.976 --> 50:47.076
I thought you loved me?

50:47.078 --> 50:50.146
- There was a time,

50:50.148 --> 50:54.750
a long time ago.

50:54.752 --> 50:57.119
- I missed you Jennifer.

50:57.121 --> 51:00.790
I missed you so so much.

51:00.792 --> 51:04.126
- I missed you too.

51:04.128 --> 51:05.528
I did I missed you.

51:19.342 --> 51:23.012
- I just,
that didn't work for me.

51:23.014 --> 51:25.014
- Okay cool.

51:25.016 --> 51:27.049
Bye.

51:27.051 --> 51:28.584
Okay so Jody just gave me

51:28.586 --> 51:30.753
the inside scoop
that James is having

51:30.755 --> 51:31.787
a party tonight.

51:31.789 --> 51:34.090
And he's gonna send
me the address,

51:34.092 --> 51:35.091
I think we should go

51:35.093 --> 51:36.025
and I can meet you guys there.

51:36.027 --> 51:37.493
- Yeah, absolutely.

51:37.495 --> 51:38.427
- And I still have to
watch the movie with Jody

51:38.429 --> 51:40.129
later, the first to Jennifer.

51:40.131 --> 51:41.363
- Yeah that sounds perfect.

51:41.365 --> 51:42.598
Oh my god yeah.

51:42.600 --> 51:43.833
- Mack I don't
think it's a good idea

51:43.835 --> 51:46.502
I mean do you really
wanna meet him at a party?

51:46.504 --> 51:48.137
- Yeah, I absolutely
wanna meet him,

51:48.139 --> 51:49.505
I need to talk to him like now.

51:49.507 --> 51:50.339
- It's just not--

51:50.341 --> 51:51.040
- we have to crack--

51:51.042 --> 51:51.941
- it's just fun,

51:51.943 --> 51:53.209
party crashing.

51:53.211 --> 51:54.176
- This is not
a professional setting

51:54.178 --> 51:55.144
to meet somebody in bud.

51:55.146 --> 51:56.145
- I don't care.

51:56.147 --> 51:57.046
- I wanna meet him tonight.

51:57.048 --> 51:58.447
- Yeah, we're going.

52:09.326 --> 52:11.227
Thing is Jennifer.

52:11.229 --> 52:13.429
When you broke my heart,

52:13.431 --> 52:20.903
I knew that I have to kill you.

52:20.905 --> 52:25.508
- Please Michael.

52:25.510 --> 52:27.176
You don't have to do this.

52:27.178 --> 52:30.880
- On the contrary.

52:30.882 --> 52:34.817
It's the only thing
i have left anymore.

52:34.819 --> 52:37.353
Then I'll slit my throat

52:37.355 --> 52:41.023
and die beside you, it's

52:41.025 --> 52:45.127
the only way.

52:45.129 --> 52:49.131
Don't cry Jennifer.

52:49.133 --> 52:51.467
Tears won't save you.

52:51.469 --> 52:54.537
I've waited years
for this moment.

52:54.539 --> 52:57.473
Watching you endlessly,

52:57.475 --> 52:59.208
witnessing your most

52:59.210 --> 53:03.245
intimate moments.

53:03.247 --> 53:07.783
If only you had any left.

53:07.785 --> 53:09.185
- I didn't Michael.

53:16.359 --> 53:20.196
We grew apart.

53:20.198 --> 53:22.598
I haven't even
seen you in years.

53:29.406 --> 53:35.244
And now you show up
wanting to kill me.

53:35.246 --> 53:40.683
You lost yourself.

53:40.685 --> 53:46.922
The man you used
to be, I didn't...

53:46.924 --> 53:48.891
I didn't leave you.

53:48.893 --> 53:52.328
- Okay Jennifer.

53:52.330 --> 53:54.396
- I didn't I swear.

53:54.398 --> 53:56.699
- I'll never forget

53:56.701 --> 53:58.267
the day you turned your back,

53:58.269 --> 54:04.306
now pay the ultimate price!

54:04.308 --> 54:06.342
Come on Jennifer.

54:34.238 --> 54:35.437
Telling you're amazing,

54:35.439 --> 54:37.172
you're so good oh my god!

54:37.174 --> 54:39.275
- You too, that was really good,

54:39.277 --> 54:40.309
you're not an actor?

54:40.311 --> 54:43.512
- That
wasn't bad mack,
that wasn't bad.

54:43.514 --> 54:44.780
- Not a day in my life,

54:44.782 --> 54:46.081
never acted a day in my life.

54:46.083 --> 54:46.815
- Nice, I'm impressed.

54:46.817 --> 54:48.884
- Oh thank you very much friend.

54:48.886 --> 54:50.219
What's next?

54:50.221 --> 54:51.754
Dude that was awesome.

54:51.756 --> 54:53.589
I think I'm gonna take
some acting classes.

54:53.591 --> 54:55.391
- Yeah dude you were

54:55.393 --> 54:57.259
a little flat to be
honest with you bro.

54:57.261 --> 54:58.394
- Oh fuck no I was awesome.

54:58.396 --> 54:59.461
- Oh whatever,

54:59.463 --> 55:00.696
Jennifer's really good man.

55:00.698 --> 55:01.864
- Dude, Jennifer's
really hot man.

55:01.866 --> 55:04.266
- Dude, she's
not that cute bro.

55:04.268 --> 55:05.200
- Oh, oh--

55:05.202 --> 55:07.670
- No she flame,

55:07.672 --> 55:08.337
- Come on

55:08.339 --> 55:09.338
a professional--

55:09.340 --> 55:10.306
- oh whoa whoa hey hey,

55:10.308 --> 55:11.307

55:11.309 --> 55:12.775
Jennifer's the
best fucking thing

55:12.777 --> 55:14.009
that could've happened
to this production, okay?

55:14.011 --> 55:16.512
A, she flame, b, she's
a killer actress,

55:16.514 --> 55:18.147
and c, she knows Jody barton

55:18.149 --> 55:19.248

55:19.250 --> 55:20.649
tonight where James
is gonna be, okay?

55:20.651 --> 55:22.451
That's something you
yourself could not procure.

55:25.189 --> 55:28.324
Dude.

55:28.326 --> 55:30.359
- Okay what do you want?

55:30.361 --> 55:31.827
- Dude who you
talking to in there?

55:31.829 --> 55:32.861
- Jennifer.

55:32.863 --> 55:33.796
- Well I got
your phone right here,

55:33.798 --> 55:34.997
so how are you talking to her?

55:34.999 --> 55:37.433
- I meant I'm rehearsing
a scene in my head,

55:37.435 --> 55:38.701
I'm trying to hear

55:38.703 --> 55:39.935

55:43.641 --> 55:44.940

phone, I don't know.

55:44.942 --> 55:46.942
Yeah.

55:46.944 --> 55:48.377
Everything cool?

55:48.379 --> 55:49.411
Everything okay?

55:49.413 --> 55:50.546
Maybe you wanna call her back?

55:50.548 --> 55:52.381
- No, it's fine.

55:52.383 --> 55:53.816
