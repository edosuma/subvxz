on this list,

by a director of color.

16:38.997 --> 16:40.916
Seriously, Mr. Smithee,
Tabby's right.

16:40.999 --> 16:43.961
There's no Kurosawa,
no Guillermo del Toro--

16:44.044 --> 16:46.255
No John Singleton,
no Ava DuVernay--

16:46.338 --> 16:49.800
As always, Miss Hayworth,
your passion for film
is... admirable,

16:49.883 --> 16:54.430

been vetted by my colleagues

vote for her for Spirit Queen.

than enough justification

wasn't interested,

-Like I give a shit

51:04.019 --> 51:05.479

51:05.562 --> 51:08.190
On the first day of school,
when I introduced myself

51:08.273 --> 51:10.150

51:10.233 --> 51:11.985
"Hi, my name is Mouse,"

51:12.068 --> 51:15.071
-she said--
-You're named after a rodent?

51:15.155 --> 51:16.615
Ew, that's disgusting.

51:16.698 --> 51:20.410
And... ever since that day,
she's called me "rodent."

51:20.494 --> 51:22.245
Okay, but why would
she go after you now?

51:22.329 --> 51:25.123
That's the terrifying
thing about Karen.

51:25.207 --> 51:26.458
She doesn't need a reason.

51:26.541 --> 51:29.836
But I did just call her
a basic Barbie,

51:29.920 --> 51:32.339

targeted us.

51:46.269 --> 51:48.897
Yes, and because no one
in the school cares enough

51:48.980 --> 51:51.900
-to hold her accountable.
-Seriously, how has Karen
not been canceled yet?

51:53.568 --> 51:55.529
Maybe we need to be
the ones to do it.

51:55.612 --> 52:00.867
My mom died...
and she didn't even bother
to come to the funeral.

52:00.951 --> 52:02.869

52:03.662 --> 52:05.121

what do we do?

52:20.387 --> 52:21.513
What can we do?

52:21.596 --> 52:22.138
Oh, that's easy.

52:24.099 --> 52:25.141
I think...

52:25.976 --> 52:29.062
we should kill Karen Beasley.
