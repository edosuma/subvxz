12:15.581 --> 12:17.514
The aliens made you pregnant?

12:22.355 --> 12:24.588
A number of times.

12:24.590 --> 12:27.091
But they take the babies
before they're born.

12:29.061 --> 12:31.362
Those are the memories
they can't remove.

12:31.364 --> 12:33.864
They removed
your unborn fetuses?

12:33.866 --> 12:35.532
(Screaming)

12:36.569 --> 12:38.535
Through here.
They do everything

12:38.537 --> 12:40.904
through here.
Even with the DNA.

12:40.906 --> 12:42.239
Tell them about your DNA, Sveta.

12:42.241 --> 12:44.274
I have alien DNA.

12:44.276 --> 12:45.509
For sure.

12:45.511 --> 12:47.544
Have you had a doctor
confirm that?

12:47.546 --> 12:49.480
No.

12:50.850 --> 12:53.183
Something you could test?

12:53.185 --> 12:54.718
Dana?

12:58.057 --> 13:00.057
♪ ♪

13:30.322 --> 13:32.956
Oh, Lord. Oh, good Lord.

13:34.927 --> 13:36.493
Damn thing could be dangerous.

13:36.495 --> 13:37.494
(Gunshots)

13:37.496 --> 13:39.596
What are you doing?!

13:39.598 --> 13:40.898
Aah!

13:40.900 --> 13:42.533
For God's sake,

13:42.535 --> 13:45.002
what have you done?

13:51.531 --> 13:53.398
I'm gonna take a swab.

13:54.700 --> 13:58.535
If you'll roll up your sleeve,
I'll get some blood, too.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.837
I know you're doubtful
about this.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.839
What makes you say that, Sveta?

14:02.841 --> 14:05.141
I'm kind of a mind reader.

14:05.143 --> 14:07.344
Is that a personal trait,

14:07.346 --> 14:10.347
or is that what happens
with alien DNA?

14:11.616 --> 14:14.317
I can move things.
With my mind.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.320
Would you care to demonstrate?

14:17.322 --> 14:18.989
I can't do it all the time.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.859
So it just... happens whenever.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.028
I don't know how to control it.

14:30.902 --> 14:33.003
You were a couple before.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.205
I'm sorry, what?

14:35.207 --> 14:37.040
You and Mr. Mulder.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.375
You were together,

14:38.377 --> 14:39.943
but now you're not.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.679
You reading my mind, Sveta?

14:43.715 --> 14:45.215
He's been depressed.

14:46.451 --> 14:47.951
What you diagnosed

14:47.953 --> 14:49.886
as endogenous depression.

14:51.590 --> 14:54.124
It's what killed
your relationship.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.128
Oh.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.063
And you have a child together.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.234
(Grunts)

15:04.236 --> 15:05.668
That's enough.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.705
Do you believe me now?

15:10.075 --> 15:12.275
Why don't you tell me.

15:12.277 --> 15:15.879
You don't know
what it's like to be abducted.

15:15.881 --> 15:18.314
To be taken against your will.
You don't know.

15:24.289 --> 15:25.688
Well...

15:25.690 --> 15:27.323
maybe you do.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.528
(Helicopter blades whirring)

15:48.880 --> 15:50.980
I was right
about one thing.

15:50.982 --> 15:52.849
Conspiracy's made you
a very rich man.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.417
One way to look at it.

15:54.419 --> 15:56.486
What's made me rich
is my pursuit of the truth.

15:56.488 --> 15:58.555
My pursuit's not
been so lucrative.

15:58.557 --> 15:59.923
I feel I need to warn you.

15:59.925 --> 16:02.425
When we arrive at
our destination,

16:02.427 --> 16:04.594
the people we're meeting
are very paranoid

16:04.596 --> 16:06.129
about the work they do.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.845
I want to prepare you for what
you're about to see, Mr. Mulder.

16:27.018 --> 16:29.319
A Faraday cage?
For what?

16:29.321 --> 16:31.187
Do you know what an ARV is?

16:31.189 --> 16:33.823
That's what you brought
me here to see?

16:33.825 --> 16:35.158
This is Garner.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.327
He'll walk you
through the science.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.762
That's an alien
replica vehicle?

16:39.764 --> 16:41.197
Given your background,
I would've thought

16:41.199 --> 16:43.500
- you'd seen one before.
- No, never. Not like that.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.602
What we're showing you
we do at great risk.

16:45.604 --> 16:47.537
Colleagues have had labs
burned to the ground

16:47.539 --> 16:49.906
and work destroyed by
our own government.

16:55.380 --> 16:56.846
(Exhales)

17:06.491 --> 17:08.458
(High-pitched whirring)

17:26.478 --> 17:28.645
Garner: It's running
on toroidal energy,

17:28.647 --> 17:30.213
so-called zero-point energy.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.814
Simply the energy
of the universe.

17:31.816 --> 17:33.416
You're talking about
free energy?

17:33.418 --> 17:35.218
That we've had since the '40s.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.420
No fuel, no flame,
no combustion.

17:37.422 --> 17:40.823
A simple electromagnetic field.

17:40.825 --> 17:42.725
Technology kept secret
for 70 years

17:42.727 --> 17:44.761
while the world
ran on petroleum.

17:44.763 --> 17:47.530
- Oil companies making trillions.
- What I'm gonna

17:47.532 --> 17:49.699
show you next is
the most unbelievable part.

18:05.884 --> 18:08.952
Gravity warp drive--
but how?

18:08.954 --> 18:10.954
Element 115.

18:10.956 --> 18:13.523
Ununpentium.

18:13.525 --> 18:16.192
Where did you get it?

18:32.844 --> 18:34.777
Where are you going
with that thing?

18:34.779 --> 18:36.713
I'm a man of medicine, sir.

18:36.715 --> 18:39.349
It's dead. It's done now.

18:41.386 --> 18:43.386
Then why even bring me out here?

18:58.803 --> 19:00.837
(Sighs)

19:03.642 --> 19:06.643
Testing yourself
for alien DNA?

19:08.213 --> 19:10.246
High cholesterol.

19:10.248 --> 19:12.782
Sorry to barge in
on you like this.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.284
It looks like you've
had quite a day.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.120
The usual around here.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.828
Doesn't look so usual to me.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.463
It's a disease called microtia.

19:27.465 --> 19:29.699
Children born
without ears.

19:29.701 --> 19:32.335
You operate on these kids?

19:32.337 --> 19:34.504
I assist the surgeons,

19:34.506 --> 19:36.839
who are really
doing God's work.

19:36.841 --> 19:39.609
Giving kids
what their biology neglected.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.878
So it's a genetic deformity?

19:41.880 --> 19:44.814
Possibly,
but not conclusively.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.849
It's most common
in Navajo Indians.

19:46.851 --> 19:49.252
What's so striking is
how alien it looks.

19:49.254 --> 19:50.987
I assure you that is simply

19:50.989 --> 19:53.756
a random coincidence,
Mr. O'Malley.

19:53.758 --> 19:56.659
You mean, unrelated to your
previous work experience?

19:57.696 --> 19:59.862
Far, far from that experience.

19:59.864 --> 20:02.332
Do you miss it at all?
The X-Files?

20:02.334 --> 20:05.802
As a scientist, it was probably
some of the most intense

20:05.804 --> 20:08.538
and challenging work
I've ever done.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.007
I've never
felt so alive.

20:11.009 --> 20:12.642
You mean working with Mulder?

20:12.644 --> 20:15.278
Possibly one of the most intense
and challenging

20:15.280 --> 20:18.514
relationships I may ever have.

20:18.516 --> 20:22.085
And, quite honestly,
the most impossible.

20:22.087 --> 20:24.087
Yeah.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.089
I got that impression.

20:28.093 --> 20:30.827
Are you here for a reason?

20:30.829 --> 20:33.396
I needed to know
you weren't upset

20:33.398 --> 20:35.164
by Mulder putting
you on the spot

20:35.166 --> 20:37.166
with this
Sveta business.

20:37.168 --> 20:39.635
No, it's fine.
I'm...

20:39.637 --> 20:41.971
used to it.

20:41.973 --> 20:44.674
And I just wanted
to see you again.

20:50.715 --> 20:52.715
(Crickets chirping)

21:03.962 --> 21:05.461
How did you get here?

21:05.463 --> 21:08.097
Hitchhiked.

21:10.034 --> 21:11.334
There was a moment

21:11.336 --> 21:13.369
you were being asked
about your abductions--

21:13.371 --> 21:16.906
about your pregnancies, how
the aliens took your babies--

21:16.908 --> 21:19.275
and before you answered,
you looked at O'Malley.

21:19.277 --> 21:21.277
Why?

21:21.279 --> 21:24.814
Because it's not exactly
the right question.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.849
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

21:26.851 --> 21:29.318
Because I don't believe it's
aliens who were taking them.

21:29.320 --> 21:30.953
But you said you were abducted.

21:30.955 --> 21:33.823
This is difficult.

21:33.825 --> 21:35.958
These are
very difficult memories,

21:35.960 --> 21:37.960
and this is...

21:37.962 --> 21:39.996
very dangerous answers.

21:39.998 --> 21:42.932
Well, everything
stays between us, Sveta.

21:42.934 --> 21:44.867
The things I've experienced--

21:44.869 --> 21:47.370
they've affected my entire life.

21:49.674 --> 21:51.174
They've made it impossible

21:51.176 --> 21:53.643
to have anything like
a normal existence.

21:54.679 --> 21:56.212
What are you afraid of?

21:58.950 --> 22:00.950
That it only gets worse.

22:04.322 --> 22:05.822
Sveta,

22:05.824 --> 22:08.124
who took your babies?

22:11.196 --> 22:13.196
Men.

22:13.198 --> 22:15.631
Men? Humans?

22:15.633 --> 22:17.633
You saw their faces?

22:20.972 --> 22:22.972
(Crying):
Yes.

22:25.477 --> 22:27.477
(Sighs)

22:27.479 --> 22:29.912
They took me aboard their ships.

22:32.650 --> 22:34.851
And...

22:34.853 --> 22:38.421
I was afraid they would kill me
if I ever told anyone the truth.

22:40.592 --> 22:43.292
It's why
you didn't see a doctor.

22:43.294 --> 22:44.961
Who can I trust?

22:44.963 --> 22:48.364
They would call me a liar
when they're the liars.

22:48.366 --> 22:51.334
You can trust me.

22:51.336 --> 22:53.469
You worked for the government.

22:53.471 --> 22:55.938
Technically, but not for years.

22:56.975 --> 22:59.141
But you always wondered.

23:01.412 --> 23:04.146
If they weren't lying
to you, too.

23:08.653 --> 23:11.354
(Phone buzzing)

23:12.390 --> 23:14.323
Mulder.

23:14.325 --> 23:16.359
Scully, listen to me.

23:16.361 --> 23:18.828
I've been misled.
<i>We've</i> been misled.

23:18.830 --> 23:20.162
Mulder, hold on a second.

23:20.164 --> 23:22.231
No, just-just listen
to what I'm saying.

23:22.233 --> 23:24.734
What if everything we've been
led to believe in is a lie?

23:24.736 --> 23:26.903
What if there is
no alien conspiracy?

23:26.905 --> 23:28.404
Can we pull over a second?

23:28.406 --> 23:31.073
I've got to get out.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.714
Mulder,
what are you talking about?

23:38.716 --> 23:40.416
I'm talking about everything
we've been led to believe.

23:40.418 --> 23:42.051
Our work, the X-Files,
everything.

23:42.053 --> 23:44.053
Can we talk about this soon?

23:44.055 --> 23:45.721
I know why O'Malley came to us,

23:45.723 --> 23:47.290
Scully.

23:47.292 --> 23:49.792
And that girl is the key,
Scully.

23:49.794 --> 23:51.928
Sveta is the key to everything.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.362
Couldn't you be jumping
to conclusions?

23:53.364 --> 23:55.431
I can't do this over the phone
right now, Scully.

23:55.433 --> 23:57.199
I got to go.

23:57.201 --> 23:59.335
Mulder, where are you going?

23:59.337 --> 24:02.522
Mulder? Talk to me.

24:04.756 --> 24:06.523
(Key clicking in lock)

24:11.033 --> 24:13.281
_

24:13.316 --> 24:15.365
Where are they-- the files?

24:15.400 --> 24:18.301
I don't know where they are.

24:18.337 --> 24:20.537
You said no one had been down
here, it hadn't been touched.

24:20.572 --> 24:22.973
Not for 14 years since
you and Scully left the Bureau.

24:23.008 --> 24:24.574
I need access to the X-Files.

24:24.610 --> 24:27.277
Can you tell me
what this is about?

24:27.279 --> 24:30.347
It's about controlling the past
to control the future.

24:30.349 --> 24:32.716
It's about fiction
masquerading as fact.

24:32.718 --> 24:34.651
Now, you owe me
some answers, Skinner.

24:34.653 --> 24:36.253
You just calm the
hell down, Mulder,

24:36.255 --> 24:38.221
before we both
get pissed off.

24:38.223 --> 24:40.290
I don't take
orders from you.

24:40.292 --> 24:42.592
No. Who do you take orders from?

24:44.630 --> 24:47.197
Why do you think
I called you?

24:47.199 --> 24:49.165
Because I was
looking out for you,

24:49.167 --> 24:51.301
like I've always
looked out for you.

24:53.839 --> 24:57.474
A decade of my life
in this office.

24:57.476 --> 24:59.843
And all the time,
I was being led by my nose

24:59.845 --> 25:01.578
through a dark alley
to a dead end,

25:01.580 --> 25:03.079
exactly as they planned.

25:03.081 --> 25:04.281
You're blaming me for that?

25:04.283 --> 25:06.249
No, I'm blaming myself.

25:08.253 --> 25:10.086
I'm sure they lied to you, too.

25:10.088 --> 25:11.988
There hasn't been a day
since you left

25:11.990 --> 25:14.624
that I haven't reached for
my phone to call you, Mulder,

25:14.626 --> 25:16.059
wishing that you
were still down here.

25:18.997 --> 25:20.964
Since 9/11, this country
has taken a big turn

25:20.966 --> 25:22.933
in a very strange direction.

25:22.935 --> 25:24.801
How they police us
and spy on us,

25:24.803 --> 25:26.870
tell us that makes us safer?

25:26.872 --> 25:28.772
We've never been in more danger.

25:34.112 --> 25:37.247
Then do something about it,
Mulder.

25:41.787 --> 25:43.520
(Dialing)

25:43.522 --> 25:45.522
(Phone ringing)

25:47.192 --> 25:49.693
(Phone beeps)

25:49.695 --> 25:52.062
Now you've got
my number.

25:53.865 --> 25:56.599
So if you own
a registered firearm,

25:56.601 --> 25:58.702
you will actually be targeted
as an enemy

25:58.704 --> 26:00.537
by your own government

26:00.539 --> 26:02.772
in the likely imposition
of martial law.

26:02.774 --> 26:05.075
But I'd like to end the show
on a brighter note

26:05.077 --> 26:09.579
by pointing out the heroic work
being done by a friend of mine.

26:09.581 --> 26:11.614
Literally putting kids
back together

26:11.616 --> 26:14.451
who are born without something
we all take for granted.

26:15.821 --> 26:18.755
At Our Lady Of Sorrows Hospital
in Washington, DC,

26:18.757 --> 26:20.757
Dr. Dana Scully,

26:20.759 --> 26:23.393
working to mend the lives
of unfortunate children.

26:23.395 --> 26:25.195
Dr. Scully?

26:25.197 --> 26:26.329
I've got
your test results back.

26:26.331 --> 26:27.397
Thank you.

26:40.145 --> 26:41.478
Nurse?

26:42.948 --> 26:44.881
I need you to
do something.

26:44.883 --> 26:46.349
Of course.

26:46.351 --> 26:48.585
I need these samples retested.

26:48.587 --> 26:49.719
Was there a problem
with them?

26:49.721 --> 26:51.287
Man:
Dr. Scully?

26:51.289 --> 26:53.390
We need you in here.

26:53.392 --> 26:55.759
I just want them
retested, please.

26:55.761 --> 26:57.427
Thank you. Oh.

26:57.429 --> 27:00.730
And I'm expecting a call--
well, I'm hoping for a call--

27:00.732 --> 27:02.966
from somebody named Mulder.

27:04.771 --> 27:07.781
_

27:14.312 --> 27:16.746
Is the hour
absolutely necessary?

27:16.748 --> 27:18.414
It was important
that I see you.

27:18.416 --> 27:20.049
We made an agreement
about our meeting

27:20.051 --> 27:21.517
in unsecured environments.

27:21.519 --> 27:24.287
I took the usual precautions.
I'm assuming you did, too.

27:24.289 --> 27:25.388
(Plane engine humming)

27:27.092 --> 27:28.558
I've been standing here
for over an hour.

27:28.560 --> 27:29.826
I haven't seen a soul.

27:29.828 --> 27:32.428
I called you
because you said,

27:32.430 --> 27:33.630
if I ever put
the pieces together,

27:33.632 --> 27:34.864
that you would confirm.

27:34.866 --> 27:36.366
And have you put them together?

27:36.368 --> 27:38.468
I've met someone,
I've seen something.

27:38.470 --> 27:40.270
'Cause you weren't
even close.

27:40.272 --> 27:42.905
Warring aliens
lighting each other on fire

27:42.907 --> 27:44.540
and other such nonsense.

27:44.542 --> 27:46.676
I was being
cleverly manipulated.

27:46.678 --> 27:48.978
And what brings
this new clarity?

27:48.980 --> 27:51.514
I saw an ARV
running on free energy.

27:51.516 --> 27:53.716
I saw it disappear.

27:53.718 --> 27:55.151
That's what they all seem to do.

27:55.153 --> 27:56.853
But the technology exists.

27:56.855 --> 27:59.155
It's existed since Roswell.
And it's been in use,

27:59.157 --> 28:01.224
<i>being used on humans</i>

28:01.226 --> 28:03.559
in human testing, the taking
of men, women and children

28:03.561 --> 28:05.695
that's misreported
as alien abductions.

28:05.697 --> 28:07.497
- So you believe you have the how.
- Yes.

28:07.499 --> 28:09.399
And I think I know the why.

28:09.401 --> 28:12.902
The why is more complicated than
you may ever know, Mr. Mulder.

28:12.904 --> 28:14.304
60 years ago, we were warned

28:14.306 --> 28:16.306
about the military
industrial complex

28:16.308 --> 28:17.840
gathering too much power.

28:17.842 --> 28:19.142
This is old news.

28:19.144 --> 28:20.510
The countdown has begun.

28:20.512 --> 28:21.711
It began in 2012,
but no one knew.

28:21.713 --> 28:23.513
Tell me something new.

28:23.515 --> 28:25.682
Alien technology
being used against us,

28:25.684 --> 28:28.651
not by aliens, not with aliens,

28:28.653 --> 28:33.356
but by a venal conspiracy of men
against humanity.

28:33.358 --> 28:34.891
You're wasting my time.

28:34.893 --> 28:36.092
What are the tests for?

28:36.094 --> 28:37.927
You tell me, Mr. Mulder.

28:37.929 --> 28:40.496
Ten years ago, you came to me

28:40.498 --> 28:42.799
saying you couldn't take
your secrets to your grave,

28:42.801 --> 28:44.500
that you couldn't live with it.

28:44.502 --> 28:46.002
I'm a man of medicine.

28:46.004 --> 28:48.705
I didn't know
how my work would be used.

28:50.542 --> 28:53.209
<i>The lies are so great,
Mr. Mulder.</i>

28:53.211 --> 28:54.577
<i>The truth must be</i>

28:54.579 --> 28:55.845
unassailable.

28:55.847 --> 28:57.447
So let me tell the world.

28:57.449 --> 28:58.948
They'll make a mockery of us.

28:58.950 --> 29:00.550
Then let me take that bullet.

29:00.552 --> 29:02.251
And these men are capable
of that.

29:03.788 --> 29:05.722
You're nearly there.

29:05.724 --> 29:07.190
You're close.

29:15.900 --> 29:18.134
Roswell.

29:18.136 --> 29:20.536
That was a smokescreen.

29:23.308 --> 29:25.475
So I've been told.

29:38.189 --> 29:39.989
What are you doing here, Scully?

29:39.991 --> 29:43.192
Mulder, you hang up on me,
I don't hear from you all day,

29:43.194 --> 29:45.094
you're on some jag
about the X-Files.

29:45.096 --> 29:46.429
I figured it out.

29:46.431 --> 29:47.764
It all makes
complete sense.

29:47.766 --> 29:49.599
All these years,
we've been deceived.

29:49.601 --> 29:51.567
I don't know what you mean.

29:51.569 --> 29:55.037
I... I couldn't call you
because it's gonna sound crazy.

29:55.039 --> 29:57.206
That's why I'm here, Mulder,
as somebody who cares about you.

29:57.208 --> 29:59.842
- As somebody who's worried about you.
- All right, just listen to me, all right?

29:59.844 --> 30:00.910
No, you listen to me, Mulder.

30:00.912 --> 30:03.146
Scully, you got
to trust me on this.

30:03.148 --> 30:04.414
I have seen this before.

30:04.416 --> 30:05.748
You're on fire,

30:05.750 --> 30:07.417
believing that
you're onto some truth,

30:07.419 --> 30:09.118
that you can save the world.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.753
This will finally be
their undoing.

30:10.755 --> 30:12.321
It'll be <i> your</i> undoing, Mulder.

30:12.323 --> 30:14.056
This is my life.
This is everything.

30:14.058 --> 30:15.491
This is everything I believe in.

30:15.493 --> 30:17.393
You want to believe.

30:17.395 --> 30:19.629
You so badly want to believe.

30:19.631 --> 30:21.030
I do believe.

30:21.032 --> 30:23.099
I believe
that Tad O'Malley is right.

30:23.101 --> 30:24.600
This is not an alien conspiracy.

30:24.602 --> 30:26.469
It's a conspiracy of men.

30:26.471 --> 30:29.405
Tad O'Malley is a charming man
full of charming BS, Mulder.

30:29.407 --> 30:30.773
No, he woke me up.

30:30.775 --> 30:32.642
How do you know
he's not playing you?

30:32.644 --> 30:35.445
- He's a player.
- He's been a godsend.

30:35.447 --> 30:36.679
What are you talking about?

30:36.681 --> 30:38.147
The truth is out
there, Scully,

30:38.149 --> 30:40.550
and Tad O'Malley's
gonna broadcast it.

30:40.552 --> 30:42.919
Mulder... listen to me.

30:42.921 --> 30:45.521
As your friend
and as a physician,

30:45.523 --> 30:48.024
you are on
dangerous ground here.

30:48.026 --> 30:50.626
I know what I'm doing.

30:50.628 --> 30:52.628
Sveta:
Is everything okay?

30:57.235 --> 30:59.202
Yeah, everything is okay.

31:01.406 --> 31:03.506
She's the key
to everything.

31:03.508 --> 31:05.041
Sveta... is the key.

31:08.480 --> 31:09.812
You know what you're doing.

31:16.354 --> 31:18.488
Scully...

31:21.192 --> 31:23.392
(Car door opens)

31:35.472 --> 31:37.039
(Car door opens)

31:38.709 --> 31:39.708
(Car door shuts)

31:40.744 --> 31:42.244
- (Knocks on window)
- Hey.

31:42.246 --> 31:43.412
Where you going?

31:44.715 --> 31:46.381
You're not leaving, are you?

31:46.383 --> 31:48.550
I just need to get out of here.

31:48.552 --> 31:49.718
Stay.

31:49.720 --> 31:50.619
It's important.

31:50.621 --> 31:52.054
Don't tell me

31:52.056 --> 31:53.555
what's important, please.

31:53.557 --> 31:54.956
I just need to leave.

31:54.958 --> 31:56.825
Wasn't she invited?

31:56.827 --> 31:59.294
I would have
invited you, Scully,

31:59.296 --> 32:00.328
but I didn't think you'd come.

32:00.330 --> 32:02.130
I shouldn't have come.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.133
Then what are you doing here?

32:05.135 --> 32:06.568
Mulder, what are you up to?

32:07.971 --> 32:09.871
Mulder:
<i>The tentacles reach far back</i>

32:09.873 --> 32:11.740
into the last century,

32:11.742 --> 32:14.443
but it wasn't until victories
in Europe and Japan

32:14.445 --> 32:16.044
and the onset of the Cold War

32:16.046 --> 32:18.180
that political
and economic conditions

32:18.182 --> 32:20.482
became perfect
for actual execution.

32:20.484 --> 32:22.584
A conspiracy bigger
and more secret

32:22.586 --> 32:23.952
than the Manhattan Project.

32:23.954 --> 32:26.254
More odious
and far-reaching.

32:26.256 --> 32:27.289
No sooner had we
defeated Germany

32:27.291 --> 32:28.657
than a new threat

32:28.659 --> 32:30.425
started appearing
in skies over America,

32:30.427 --> 32:31.593
<i>drawn to Earth</i>

32:31.595 --> 32:34.262
by the latest threat
to extinction-- The H-bomb.

32:34.264 --> 32:36.698
<i>Explosions acting
as transducers,</i>

32:36.700 --> 32:39.034
<i>drawing alien life forms
through wormholes</i>

32:39.036 --> 32:41.436
in spaceships using
electrogravitic propulsion.

32:42.539 --> 32:46.374
Advanced extraterrestrial
species visiting us,

32:46.376 --> 32:48.443
<i>concerned for mankind and the
threat of our self-destruction,</i>

32:48.445 --> 32:50.879
<i>forestalling our annihilation</i>

32:50.881 --> 32:52.380
<i>through their own
self-sacrifice.</i>

32:52.382 --> 32:53.882
<i>The crashes at Roswell.</i>

32:53.884 --> 32:55.417
<i>More importantly,
places like Aztec.</i>

32:56.887 --> 32:57.986
World leaders signed
secret memos

32:57.988 --> 32:59.621
<i>directing scientific studies</i>

32:59.623 --> 33:01.156
<i>of alien technology</i>

33:01.158 --> 33:02.524
and biochemistry.

33:02.526 --> 33:04.025
<i>Classified studies were done</i>

33:04.027 --> 33:05.560
<i>at military installations
S4, Groom Lake,</i>

33:05.562 --> 33:07.129
Wright-Patterson and Dulce,

33:07.131 --> 33:09.631
extracting alien tissue.

33:09.633 --> 33:12.734
<i>Tests were done on
unsuspecting human subjects</i>

33:12.736 --> 33:13.969
in elaborately staged
abductions,

33:13.971 --> 33:15.770
in craft using alien technology

33:15.772 --> 33:17.539
recovered
from the downed saucers...

33:17.541 --> 33:20.142
<i>including human
hybridization</i>

33:20.144 --> 33:23.578
through gene editing
and forced implantation

33:23.580 --> 33:25.247
of alien embryos.

33:25.249 --> 33:26.715
Why do such a thing
and lie about it--

33:26.717 --> 33:28.116
our own government?

33:28.118 --> 33:29.985
Your own government lies
as a matter of course,

33:29.987 --> 33:32.721
as a matter of policy--
the Tuskegee Experiments

33:32.723 --> 33:35.490
on black men in the '30s;
Henrietta Lacks.

33:35.492 --> 33:37.225
What are they trying to do?

33:37.227 --> 33:38.894
That's the missing piece.

33:38.896 --> 33:40.395
O'Malley:
But it's not hard to imagine--

33:40.397 --> 33:41.863
a government hiding,

33:41.865 --> 33:43.231
hoarding...

33:43.233 --> 33:45.066
alien technology for 70 years,

33:45.068 --> 33:48.270
at the expense of human life
and the future of the planet.

33:48.272 --> 33:50.071
Driven not only

33:50.073 --> 33:53.608
by corporate greed,
but... a darker objective.

33:53.610 --> 33:55.744
The takeover of America.

33:55.746 --> 33:57.445
O'Malley:
And then the world itself,

33:57.447 --> 33:59.614
by any means necessary,
however violent...

33:59.616 --> 34:02.784
<i>or cruel... or efficient.</i>

34:02.786 --> 34:04.386
By severe drought

34:04.388 --> 34:06.054
<i>brought on by weather wars
conducted secretly</i>

34:06.056 --> 34:09.224
<i>using aerial contaminants
and high-altitude</i>

34:09.226 --> 34:10.659
electromagnetic waves,

34:10.661 --> 34:12.726
in a state of perpetual war

34:12.728 --> 34:15.630
<i>to create problem-reaction-
solution scenarios</i>

34:15.632 --> 34:19.534
<i>to distract, enrage and enslave
American citizens at home</i>

34:19.536 --> 34:21.235
with tools like the Patriot Act

34:21.237 --> 34:23.438
<i>and the National Defense
Authorization Act,</i>

34:23.440 --> 34:25.607
<i>which abridged the constitution
in the name</i>

34:25.609 --> 34:27.074
of national security.

34:27.077 --> 34:28.909
<i>The militarization
of police forces</i>

34:28.911 --> 34:31.346
<i>in cities across the US.</i>

34:31.348 --> 34:32.914
The building of prison camps

34:32.916 --> 34:34.748
<i>by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency</i>

34:34.751 --> 34:36.251
with no stated purpose.

34:36.253 --> 34:38.286
<i>The corporate takeover
of food and agriculture,</i>

34:38.288 --> 34:39.654
<i>pharmaceuticals
and health care,</i>

34:39.656 --> 34:42.924
even the military,
in clandestine agendas,

34:42.926 --> 34:45.659
<i>to fatten, dull, sicken
and control a populace</i>

34:45.661 --> 34:47.596
<i>already consumed
by consumerism.</i>

34:47.598 --> 34:49.563
And I encourage you all
to go shopping more.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.466
<i>A government
that taps your phone,</i>

34:51.467 --> 34:53.601
<i>collects your data
and monitors your whereabouts</i>

34:53.603 --> 34:54.835
<i>with impunity.</i>

34:54.838 --> 34:57.072
A government preparing
to use that data

34:57.074 --> 34:59.274
<i>against you when it strikes</i>

34:59.276 --> 35:01.409
and the final takeover begins.

35:02.579 --> 35:04.980
- The takeover of America.
- By a well-oiled

35:04.982 --> 35:07.449
and well-armed
multinational group of elites

35:07.451 --> 35:10.151
that will cull,
kill and subjugate.

35:10.153 --> 35:11.953
Happening as we sit here.

35:11.955 --> 35:14.089
It's happening all around us.

35:14.091 --> 35:15.690
The other shoe waiting to drop.

35:15.692 --> 35:17.859
It'll probably
start on a Friday.

35:17.861 --> 35:19.828
The banks will announce
a security action

35:19.830 --> 35:22.831
necessitating their computers
to go offline all weekend.

35:22.833 --> 35:24.633
Digital money will disappear.

35:24.635 --> 35:25.800
They can just steal your money?

35:25.802 --> 35:27.102
Followed by the detonation

35:27.104 --> 35:29.371
of strategic
electromagnetic pulse bombs

35:29.373 --> 35:31.306
- to knock out major grids.
- What will seem

35:31.308 --> 35:34.175
like an attack on America
by terrorists or Russia.
