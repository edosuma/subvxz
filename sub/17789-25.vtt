09:17.049 --> 09:19.518
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

09:19.551 --> 09:20.819
Mmm!

09:20.852 --> 09:22.421
Oh, man!

09:24.856 --> 09:27.026
[ Roars ]

09:27.059 --> 09:28.160
[ Growls weakly ]

09:28.193 --> 09:29.962
Ha! Potroficus!

09:29.995 --> 09:31.063
[ Gasps ]

09:31.096 --> 09:32.631
Oh, no! My hat!

09:32.664 --> 09:33.899
[ Roars ]

09:33.933 --> 09:37.036
Too late, little man.
You got beat.

09:37.069 --> 09:38.870
I think you mean
"beaten."

09:38.904 --> 09:41.140
Ha! You think
you can troll a troll?

09:41.173 --> 09:43.108
You got a lot to learn.
I know.

09:43.142 --> 09:44.376
I always thought
trolls were, like,

09:44.409 --> 09:46.912
those little porcelain guys
on the lawn.

09:46.946 --> 09:48.880
That's gnomes.
You know that's gnomes.

09:48.914 --> 09:50.282
Oh. Right.

09:50.315 --> 09:52.317
You guys are the ones
with the lucky charms.

09:52.351 --> 09:55.087
No! That's leprechauns!
You're talking about lepre--

09:56.088 --> 09:57.322
Aaaah! Oof!

09:57.356 --> 09:59.158
[ Gasps ]
You found his weakness!

09:59.191 --> 10:01.026
Trolls are only as big
as we make them.

10:01.060 --> 10:02.027
Keep doing it.

10:02.061 --> 10:03.095
Keep doing what?

10:03.128 --> 10:04.363
Being yourself.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.664
Okay.

10:05.697 --> 10:07.967
So, if you're a troll, why don't
you have an Irish accent

10:08.000 --> 10:09.334
and live
at the end of a rainbow?

10:09.368 --> 10:11.903
That's totally leprechauns!
Stop doing leprechauns!

10:11.937 --> 10:13.138
[ Screams ]

10:13.172 --> 10:14.506
Got it --
so the orcs are the ones

10:14.539 --> 10:16.075
with the big feet
that live in the burrows.

10:16.108 --> 10:18.077
No!
The orcs are the --

10:18.110 --> 10:19.878
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You're right.

10:19.911 --> 10:22.281
Orcas are
the panda-looking whales.

10:22.314 --> 10:23.415
Ugh!

10:23.448 --> 10:26.151
Man, it stank in there!
He's disgusting.

10:26.185 --> 10:28.320
Actually, elves are quite cute
when they're small.

10:28.353 --> 10:30.155
I am not an elf!
Would you --

10:30.189 --> 10:31.356
Stop it! Stop it!

10:31.390 --> 10:32.457
[ High-pitched ]
Stop it!

10:32.491 --> 10:33.959
I think
we found your talent.

10:33.993 --> 10:35.394
What is it?

10:36.996 --> 10:39.398
You're supernaturally
annoying.

Eh.
