00:00.730 --> 00:02.019
<i>Previously on</i> Mike & Molly...

00:02.020 --> 00:05.495
This book that sits before me
is the physical manifestation

00:05.496 --> 00:08.330
of all your hard work,
the fruits of your labor,

00:08.332 --> 00:11.201
the vessel in which you've
laid bare your soul,

00:11.202 --> 00:13.503
exposing it like
a freshly waxed orifice.

00:13.504 --> 00:14.771
Now let me see the orifice!

00:14.772 --> 00:16.972
I mean, the-the book.
Gah! The book, the book.

00:18.109 --> 00:19.643
I remember when
I was a little girl

00:19.644 --> 00:21.278
working on my daddy's farm...

00:21.279 --> 00:22.679
Oh, please don't
tell me a story.

00:22.680 --> 00:23.847
Let me tell you a story.

00:23.848 --> 00:25.816
I was a meek little thing,

00:25.817 --> 00:28.819
scared of my own shadow
and the sheep I had to castrate.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.755
That's where you learned it?

00:31.756 --> 00:35.659
Just when I thought my life
couldn't possibly get any worse,

00:35.660 --> 00:38.962
a city fella in a '56 Rambler
pulled up to the house

00:38.963 --> 00:40.697
and asked for directions.

00:40.698 --> 00:42.165
Was that Mike's dad?

00:42.166 --> 00:43.567
Hell no.

00:43.568 --> 00:45.135
This was a real man.

00:45.136 --> 00:48.071
Wore a three-piece suit
with hard shoes

00:48.072 --> 00:52.042
and smelled like a pine forest
after a spring rain.

00:52.043 --> 00:53.910
That's very poetic, Peggy.

00:53.911 --> 00:55.612
What he did to me wasn't poetic.

00:55.613 --> 00:57.380
It was filthy.

00:57.381 --> 00:58.548
And I loved it.

00:58.549 --> 01:01.051
All right, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:01.052 --> 01:02.419
Got to write it down. Go.

01:02.420 --> 01:04.688
MIKE: <i>Oh, look at you,
</i> writing again.

01:04.688 --> 01:05.722
Yeah, new story.

01:05.723 --> 01:08.592
About a young girl coming
of age on a hardscrabble farm

01:08.593 --> 01:10.260
at the base of
the Mudlick Mountains.

01:10.261 --> 01:11.761
Mudlick?
That's-that's where...

01:11.762 --> 01:14.129
My mom grew up
on a farm in Mudlick.

01:16.601 --> 01:19.168
Oh, no!

01:22.440 --> 01:26.510
Session one,
untitled Biggs-Flynn novel.

01:26.511 --> 01:29.345
Uh, 8:55 a.m.

01:30.915 --> 01:33.082
Go.

01:33.084 --> 01:35.852
Do you have to use
that stupid thing?

01:35.853 --> 01:38.121
Well, I don't want to, you know,
miss any of the details,

01:38.122 --> 01:40.323
and over the years,
I've-I've kind of learned

01:40.324 --> 01:42.658
to tune you out
when you start talking.

01:42.660 --> 01:45.562
Feels like I'm giving
a damn deposition.

01:45.563 --> 01:48.565
Like when Mr. Mariachi Music
next door

01:48.566 --> 01:50.834
found dog dirt in his mailbox.

01:50.835 --> 01:54.771
Which, again,
I had nothing to do with.

01:54.772 --> 01:56.540
Peggy, relax,
you're not on trial.

01:56.541 --> 01:58.742
Just tell me your story
from the beginning,

01:58.743 --> 02:01.578
way before you were
torturing your neighbors.

02:01.579 --> 02:02.979
Allegedly.

02:02.980 --> 02:04.180
Okay.

02:04.181 --> 02:06.683
You're a little girl
in Mudlick, Missouri.

02:06.684 --> 02:09.418
Just take me through
a typical day on the farm.

02:12.223 --> 02:14.957
It's pretty much
what you'd expect.

02:17.061 --> 02:19.796
Care to elaborate?

02:19.797 --> 02:21.797
Um...

02:23.267 --> 02:24.935
You know.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.937
No. I really...

02:26.938 --> 02:28.972
I really don't.

02:28.973 --> 02:31.041
Come on, give me some details.

02:31.042 --> 02:33.109
The earthy,
sharp smell of the barn,

02:33.110 --> 02:35.011
or the-the feel
of the, you know,

02:35.012 --> 02:37.847
threadbare calico
on your bony shoulders.

02:37.848 --> 02:40.716
Boy, it's as if you were there.

02:40.718 --> 02:42.419
Well, then tell me
what it <i> was</i> like.

02:42.420 --> 02:44.119
Fine.

02:48.259 --> 02:51.094
It's pretty much
what you'd expect.

02:51.095 --> 02:52.429
Oh, for crying out loud.

02:52.430 --> 02:53.395
Wait.

02:53.397 --> 02:55.298
You just reminded me
of something.

02:55.299 --> 02:56.699
Okay, finally.

02:56.701 --> 02:58.635
If I'm going
to make chili tonight,

02:58.636 --> 03:00.736
I better go soak those beans.

03:05.543 --> 03:08.878
Friday, 8:58 a.m.

03:08.879 --> 03:10.413
And if you're listening to this,

03:10.414 --> 03:12.681
you know why
I killed Peggy Biggs.

03:48.973 --> 03:52.809
Why does your mother have to
make everything so difficult?!

03:53.912 --> 03:55.446
I don't know.
Why is the sky blue?

03:55.447 --> 03:56.847
Why do I eat my feelings?

03:56.848 --> 03:58.615
We'll never know.

03:58.616 --> 04:00.350
I was there
for eight hours today.

04:00.351 --> 04:03.153
Want to hear some of the
wonderful work that we got done?

04:03.154 --> 04:04.154
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

04:04.155 --> 04:05.822
What's that?

04:05.824 --> 04:08.525
That's me vacuuming
your mom's house.

04:08.526 --> 04:10.327
And then after that...

04:10.328 --> 04:11.528
(garbage disposal grinding)

04:11.529 --> 04:14.732
Aw, you fixed her disposal.

04:14.733 --> 04:15.699
Oh, yeah.

04:15.700 --> 04:16.767
And then I changed
the lightbulbs,

04:16.767 --> 04:18.235
then I took her dog for a walk,

04:18.236 --> 04:20.269
all 'cause that was supposed
to help her write.

04:20.271 --> 04:21.305
Well, did it?

04:21.305 --> 04:22.639
Well, you tell me.

04:22.640 --> 04:23.974
(snoring)

04:23.975 --> 04:26.543
Yeah, she nodded off
while I was folding her laundry.

04:26.544 --> 04:28.545
I let her sleep, 'cause
I thought maybe she'd talk

04:28.546 --> 04:29.780
at least while she was asleep.

04:29.781 --> 04:31.348
Did she?
Ah, she just

04:31.349 --> 04:33.984
grumbled about
closing our borders.

04:33.985 --> 04:35.552
She's impossible.

04:35.553 --> 04:38.554
Wait. Are you saying
my mother's hard to work with?

04:38.556 --> 04:39.690
Yes.
That's weird.

04:39.691 --> 04:43.193
'cause with everybody else,
she's exactly the same!

04:43.194 --> 04:46.396
Will you please
just let me complain?!

04:46.397 --> 04:47.397
No.

04:47.398 --> 04:48.599
I warned you.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.234
But you chose to partner
with Peggy Biggs.

04:50.235 --> 04:51.468
It's like when I ate that

04:51.469 --> 04:53.003
Tombstone Meat Lover's
Pizza at 1:00 a.m.

04:53.004 --> 04:54.371
You told me it would
give me heartburn.

04:54.372 --> 04:55.205
Which it did!

04:55.206 --> 04:58.242
Which is why you wouldn't
let me complain about it.

04:58.243 --> 05:00.577
Believe me, I knew of
your discomfort.

05:00.578 --> 05:02.578
You "vented" in other ways.

05:02.580 --> 05:04.882
I'll give you the same counsel
you gave me.

05:04.883 --> 05:06.016
"Sorry you don't feel good,

05:06.017 --> 05:08.217
but you need
to take that outside."

05:09.087 --> 05:11.254
Aw, come on!

05:14.292 --> 05:17.094
There he is.

05:17.095 --> 05:18.095
Gentlemen.

05:18.096 --> 05:19.263
(both laugh)

05:19.264 --> 05:20.964
I can't believe
the warden let you out.

05:20.965 --> 05:22.565
Well, the warden
and the executioner

05:22.567 --> 05:24.368
are writing together now,
so my weekend's free.

05:24.369 --> 05:25.536
I can do whatever I want.

05:25.537 --> 05:26.937
All right.

05:26.938 --> 05:28.305
What do you want to do first?

05:28.306 --> 05:30.674
Well, since the ladies are
a little tied up with the book,

05:30.675 --> 05:33.010
I got to pick up corn pads
for my mom at the drugstore,

05:33.011 --> 05:34.344
then swing through Target

05:34.345 --> 05:36.346
and replace this pillow
that's hurting Molly's neck,

05:36.347 --> 05:37.781
then a quick stop
at the supermarket

05:37.782 --> 05:40.150
to pick up the food to cook
dinner for my hardworking gals.

05:40.151 --> 05:41.952
Are you kidding?

05:41.953 --> 05:43.520
That's how you're gonna
spend your freedom?

05:43.521 --> 05:45.622
You were better
off on the inside.

05:45.623 --> 05:47.357
It's not so bad.

05:47.358 --> 05:50.661
Molly said I can do these things
in any order I wanted.

05:50.662 --> 05:52.129
Mike, come on.

05:52.130 --> 05:54.364
We came over to hang out,
not run errands.

05:54.365 --> 05:56.133
Bros before chores.

05:56.134 --> 05:59.335
Well, what were you guys
gonna do if I wasn't around?

06:03.007 --> 06:05.274
We'll start off at the Target.

06:09.214 --> 06:10.647
Watch your head.

06:10.648 --> 06:12.082
Okay.

06:12.083 --> 06:14.483
Don't step in the rat traps.

06:14.485 --> 06:16.386
And if you believe in
all that asbestos nonsense,

06:16.387 --> 06:17.553
don't breathe too deep.

06:19.257 --> 06:22.259
I never do in your house.

06:22.260 --> 06:23.660
Now, let's see.

06:23.661 --> 06:27.296
I got some photo albums
around here somewhere.

06:27.298 --> 06:30.167
Oh, look,
Mike's old catcher's mitt.

06:30.168 --> 06:32.669
Nah, that's mine.

06:32.670 --> 06:34.137
From the church softball league.

06:34.138 --> 06:35.906
That's where I learned
to chew tobacco.

06:35.907 --> 06:37.374
Oh.

06:37.375 --> 06:40.177
I always wondered how you became
such an accurate spitter.

06:40.178 --> 06:41.778
Yeah.

06:41.779 --> 06:44.314
Here we go.
(chuckles)

06:44.315 --> 06:46.950
Oh, wedding pictures.

06:46.951 --> 06:49.887
Peggy, you were
a beautiful bride.

06:49.888 --> 06:52.890
I was pregnant.

06:52.891 --> 06:56.393
Well, that explains the glow.

06:56.394 --> 07:00.163
Don't tell Mikey. I wouldn't
want him to think less of me.

07:00.164 --> 07:02.032
Not possible.

07:02.033 --> 07:04.234
Hey, do you have any pictures

07:04.235 --> 07:06.169
from when you were
growing up on the farm?

07:06.170 --> 07:09.873
Well, I think there might be
here in this box.

07:09.874 --> 07:10.874
Let's see.

07:10.875 --> 07:13.343
Aw, look at that.

07:13.344 --> 07:14.411
What is that?

07:14.412 --> 07:16.212
Mikey's hair.

07:18.149 --> 07:19.683
Oh, feel how soft.

07:19.684 --> 07:21.184
You want to touch it?
Oh, no, that's okay.

07:21.185 --> 07:23.120
That's okay.

07:23.121 --> 07:24.855
I-I prefer touching
the living stuff.

07:24.856 --> 07:26.290
Yeah.

07:26.291 --> 07:29.558
You probably don't want to see
his nail clippings then, right?

07:32.096 --> 07:34.398
Hey, what's, uh...
what's in here?

07:34.399 --> 07:36.733
Oh, that's nothing... just
some old blankets, you know.

07:36.734 --> 07:38.902
Oh, like quilts?
I'd love to see them.

07:38.903 --> 07:41.505
Yeah, leave it. Hey, you know,
now I think there might be

07:41.506 --> 07:43.006
some old photos
over here somewhere.

07:43.007 --> 07:45.375
Oh. Well, you know what?
Why don't I start here?

07:45.376 --> 07:46.910
You never know
what might spark a story.

07:46.911 --> 07:47.911
Yeah, leave it.

07:47.912 --> 07:51.949
All right. In fact, we should
be looking in the garage.

07:51.950 --> 07:53.250
There's nothing up here.

07:53.251 --> 07:54.985
What... what are you
talking about?

07:54.986 --> 07:56.920
This whole place
is filled with memories.

07:56.921 --> 07:58.087
Oh...

07:59.724 --> 08:00.990
Okay!

08:03.795 --> 08:05.295
PEGGY: I'm gonna lock the door!

08:05.296 --> 08:06.463
You coming or not?!

08:06.464 --> 08:07.764
Yeah, just a minute!

08:07.765 --> 08:08.932
(loud snap) Ow!

08:08.933 --> 08:11.335
Son of a bitch!

08:11.336 --> 08:14.437
Reset that rat trap
before you come down.

08:18.676 --> 08:20.978
I'm telling you,
that woman is driving me nuts.

08:20.979 --> 08:22.512
And I can't even kill her,

08:22.513 --> 08:25.549
'cause I've already
confessed to it on tape.

08:25.550 --> 08:27.718
And then today,
I'm trying to jog her memory

08:27.719 --> 08:29.419
by digging through
all these old photos,

08:29.420 --> 08:31.421
and she just
completely shuts me out.

08:31.422 --> 08:33.490
Mm. Well, maybe you need
to partner up with a woman

08:33.491 --> 08:35.957
who has a good story to tell
and isn't afraid to work.

08:35.960 --> 08:39.895
Mom, I don't want
to write your story.

08:39.897 --> 08:42.366
Are you sure?
I got some goodies.

08:42.366 --> 08:45.535
And we're off.

08:45.536 --> 08:48.705
Did I ever tell you
I went to Woodstock?

08:48.706 --> 08:50.007
No, actually.

08:50.008 --> 08:51.408
What was that like?

08:51.409 --> 08:52.609
Amazing.

08:52.610 --> 08:55.544
The music was incredible.

08:57.682 --> 09:00.450
Yeah, and...?

09:00.451 --> 09:01.618
What do you mean, "and"?

09:01.619 --> 09:03.520
You're the writer,
fill in the blanks.

09:03.521 --> 09:06.056
I think it's a really
good story, Mom.

09:06.057 --> 09:07.657
Thank you.

09:07.658 --> 09:09.292
VINCE: Help!

09:09.293 --> 09:11.294
Little help here!

09:11.295 --> 09:12.229
All right.

09:12.230 --> 09:15.231
Steady there, Mother Biggs.

09:16.901 --> 09:18.101
I'm not kidding.

09:18.102 --> 09:20.302
It's like moving a water
bed full of schnapps.

09:20.304 --> 09:22.405
God! Where did you find her?

09:22.407 --> 09:24.274
Staggering down the street
yelling "Molly""

09:24.275 --> 09:26.810
like Brando in <i> Streetcar.</i>

09:26.811 --> 09:29.179
All the houses
around here look alike.

09:29.180 --> 09:32.582
Get your hand off my ass.

09:32.583 --> 09:34.351
I'm holding your back.

09:34.352 --> 09:36.519
I got a long crack.

09:37.655 --> 09:39.389
Okay, okay, okay.

09:39.390 --> 09:41.525
Peggy, how much have
you had to drink?

09:41.526 --> 09:44.127
Don't know.
I'm not done yet.

09:44.128 --> 09:45.228
Okay. Give me that.

09:45.229 --> 09:46.229
Give me...

09:46.230 --> 09:47.197
Give me that.

09:47.198 --> 09:48.432
I'll get you some coffee.

09:48.433 --> 09:50.400
Oh, don't bother.
I'm not staying long.

09:50.401 --> 09:51.701
I'm just gonna say my piece

09:51.702 --> 09:53.470
and then get
the hell out of here.

09:53.471 --> 09:55.472
Okay. Please, just sit down.

09:55.473 --> 09:57.106
I thought I was.

09:58.876 --> 10:01.411
I'm through with
this book business.

10:01.412 --> 10:03.847
You can go suck
somebody else dry.

10:03.848 --> 10:06.383
I just remembered another part
of the Woodstock story.

10:06.384 --> 10:07.716
Really?!

10:08.920 --> 10:11.488
Okay, Peggy,
what has gotten into you?

10:11.489 --> 10:13.889
I just told you.
We're done.

10:13.891 --> 10:15.959
Give them their money back.

10:15.960 --> 10:20.397
They're my stories, and they're
staying right inside of here.

10:20.398 --> 10:21.765
Okay, okay.

10:21.766 --> 10:23.166
Obviously, something
is bothering you.

10:23.167 --> 10:24.634
Victoria, go get her a blanket.

10:24.635 --> 10:26.535
We'll just discuss it
in the morning.

10:26.537 --> 10:29.072
No, we can discuss it now.

10:29.073 --> 10:31.508
Great, okay.

10:31.509 --> 10:33.009
Go... go ahead.

10:33.010 --> 10:35.244
It's none of your business!

10:36.614 --> 10:38.882
Oh, boy.
I did that too fast.

10:38.883 --> 10:42.953
Okay. Okay, I've said
what I have to say.

10:42.954 --> 10:47.623
You're a lovely
audience, and bye-bye!

10:55.566 --> 10:57.400
All right,
I know I have to get her!

10:57.401 --> 10:59.568
I just don't want to!

11:21.037 --> 11:22.423
(snoring)

11:24.741 --> 11:27.241
That can't be good.

11:28.111 --> 11:30.245
Do I want to know?

11:30.246 --> 11:31.712
She showed up here drunk.

11:31.714 --> 11:33.682
Drunk? I've seen her
have a few beers

11:33.683 --> 11:35.383
every now and then,
but never drunk.

11:35.385 --> 11:37.252
Well, you missed all the fun.

11:37.253 --> 11:39.288
Barged in here,
yelled at me about the book,

11:39.289 --> 11:41.290
and then took off
like a bat out of hell.

11:41.291 --> 11:42.890
I had to chase her
for six blocks.

11:42.892 --> 11:46.394
Good news is she runs like
a gazelle with that new hip.

11:46.396 --> 11:48.497
But why?
I don't know.

11:48.498 --> 11:49.931
Probably 'cause it's made
out of titanium.

11:49.932 --> 11:52.233
Molly...

11:52.235 --> 11:55.971
I think the idea
of her telling her story

11:55.972 --> 11:57.572
has freaked her out.

11:57.573 --> 11:58.807
Do you know anything about

11:58.808 --> 12:00.975
this hope chest
that she has up in her attic?

12:00.977 --> 12:03.078
Hope chest?

12:03.079 --> 12:04.279
You mean her grudge box?

12:04.280 --> 12:06.547
'Cause she keeps
that right by her bed. No.

12:06.549 --> 12:09.317
This is something else,
and it really set her off.

12:10.219 --> 12:12.120
Okay, well,
I'm telling you right now,

12:12.121 --> 12:14.755
I think the best thing to do is
just drop this whole book thing.

12:14.757 --> 12:15.924
What? No.

12:15.925 --> 12:17.092
We made a deal.

12:17.093 --> 12:18.459
They gave us an advance.

12:18.461 --> 12:19.561
It doesn't matter.

12:19.562 --> 12:20.896
If something's
bothering Peggy Biggs,

12:20.897 --> 12:22.164
you best not poke at it,

12:22.165 --> 12:24.498
unless you want your mail
postmarked with a dog turd.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.701
Well, what are
we supposed to do?

12:25.702 --> 12:27.201
Just pretend like none
of this ever happened?

12:27.203 --> 12:28.502
Now you got it.

12:28.504 --> 12:29.670
That's ridiculous.

12:29.672 --> 12:31.005
It's the way it is.

12:31.007 --> 12:34.642
Well, how is anybody supposed
to heal or to feel better?

12:34.644 --> 12:38.080
In my family, nobody wants to do
any of those things.

12:38.081 --> 12:39.881
Look, when one of us is upset,

12:39.882 --> 12:42.150
the general rule is:
pretend like it's not happening.

12:42.151 --> 12:45.620
Talk about sports, the weather,
anything but the actual problem.

12:45.621 --> 12:47.289
It's what we call good manners.

12:47.290 --> 12:49.056
Well, I call it denial.

12:49.058 --> 12:51.693
You can call it what you want.
It's the Biggs way.

12:51.694 --> 12:53.794
What the hell happened?

12:53.796 --> 12:56.130
You had too much to drink, Ma.

12:57.433 --> 13:01.503
You know, I-I tend to do that
when something's bothering me.

13:01.504 --> 13:03.438
And you know what helps?

13:03.439 --> 13:05.740
Talking about it.

13:05.742 --> 13:09.744
You can go to hell,
and you can take me home.

13:12.749 --> 13:14.915
See? It's just good manners.

13:25.094 --> 13:26.561
Looks like rain.

13:26.562 --> 13:28.896
It sure does.

13:33.102 --> 13:35.737
So you two are
done with the book?

13:35.738 --> 13:38.006
I am.

13:38.007 --> 13:39.707
Okay.

13:41.411 --> 13:43.544
You know, it's too bad
though, 'cause...

13:43.546 --> 13:46.581
Molly was really looking forward
to working with you.

13:46.582 --> 13:47.749
(scoffs)

13:47.750 --> 13:49.683
Very nice, lie to your mother.

13:49.685 --> 13:51.553
I'm not lying.
(scoffs)

13:51.554 --> 13:53.522
I mean, she knew it was
gonna be somewhere

13:53.523 --> 13:55.890
between miserable
and hell on earth.

13:55.892 --> 13:59.360
But she did want
to tell your story.

13:59.362 --> 14:02.964
Well, it turns out
there's nothing to tell.

14:02.965 --> 14:06.101
That's what I told her.

14:06.102 --> 14:07.768
Good.

14:11.674 --> 14:13.308
It's definitely gonna rain.

14:13.309 --> 14:14.975
Yep.

14:20.049 --> 14:22.216
(doorbell rings)

14:23.686 --> 14:26.554
What are you doing here?

14:26.556 --> 14:28.290
Since we're no longer
working together,

14:28.291 --> 14:29.958
I came to get my things.

14:29.959 --> 14:32.126
Fine.

14:44.907 --> 14:47.308
Getting a little cloudy
out there.

14:49.145 --> 14:50.778
Sure is.

14:54.250 --> 14:57.351
You know what
they always say about rain.

14:57.353 --> 14:59.620
What's that?

15:02.859 --> 15:06.127
Into every... life...

15:06.128 --> 15:08.096
a little...

15:08.097 --> 15:10.131
rain may... I don't know.

15:10.132 --> 15:12.467
I can't... I can't do this.

15:12.468 --> 15:15.003
Can we just talk about
what's going on with you?

15:15.004 --> 15:16.905
Nothing's going on with me.

15:16.906 --> 15:18.940
Come on, Peggy,
help me understand.

15:18.941 --> 15:21.510
You were so excited
about writing this book.

15:21.511 --> 15:22.878
What happened?

15:22.879 --> 15:24.279
What do you care?

15:24.280 --> 15:27.816
I care because, God help me,
you're part of my family now.

15:27.817 --> 15:30.418
And in my family,
we actually talk about

15:30.419 --> 15:31.785
what we're going through.

15:31.787 --> 15:35.356
That must be why
you're all so well-adjusted.

15:37.193 --> 15:38.927
Okay, fair point.

15:38.928 --> 15:42.931
But... trust me,
if you let this stuff fester,

15:42.932 --> 15:45.699
you will turn into
a bitter person.

15:49.372 --> 15:51.939
Or... bitterer.

15:53.876 --> 15:56.076
Or bittererer.

15:57.213 --> 15:59.446
You're not gonna
let go of this, are you?

15:59.448 --> 16:03.418
The Biggs way might be
to avoid the problem,

16:03.419 --> 16:08.056
but the Flynn way
is to care enough not to.

16:08.057 --> 16:09.491
Blech.

16:09.492 --> 16:10.926
I know.

16:10.927 --> 16:14.161
I hated it the second
it came out of my mouth.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.901
Come on!

16:19.902 --> 16:22.102
Is that you or me?

16:23.773 --> 16:25.073
Molly!

16:25.074 --> 16:26.041
Oh, me!

16:26.042 --> 16:27.241
Okay.

16:29.445 --> 16:32.914
My father sent me this trunk
just after my mother died.

16:32.915 --> 16:35.149
Oh, that's sweet.

16:35.151 --> 16:37.384
She's not in here, is she?

16:39.188 --> 16:43.357
I thought I'd never see anything
from that farm once I left.

16:44.226 --> 16:46.226
This was my first doll.

16:48.064 --> 16:50.065
Oh, she's the...

16:50.066 --> 16:53.234
stuff of nightmares.

16:53.235 --> 16:54.569
She's made of corn husk.

16:54.570 --> 16:56.037
We didn't have much.

16:56.038 --> 16:57.705
Moths ate her twin.

17:01.143 --> 17:03.311
Oh, is this your father's pipe?

17:03.312 --> 17:04.512
My mother's.

17:04.512 --> 17:06.448
Don't you know
what a woman's pipe looks like?

17:06.449 --> 17:08.016
Oh.

17:08.017 --> 17:09.751
Yeah, now-now I see it.

17:09.752 --> 17:13.153
Very... very feminine.

17:13.155 --> 17:16.657
After Daddy went to bed,
she'd sneak out on the porch,

17:16.659 --> 17:18.126
smoke her pipe, and just cry.

17:18.127 --> 17:19.127
Oh.

17:19.127 --> 17:20.561
Why was she crying?

17:20.563 --> 17:22.631
I told you,
it was hard on that farm.

17:22.632 --> 17:25.165
We barely scraped by.

17:25.166 --> 17:28.903
And when things went really bad,
Daddy got angry.

17:28.904 --> 17:31.272
Angry how?

17:31.273 --> 17:33.708
He started hitting.

17:33.709 --> 17:35.777
The walls, the dog...

17:35.778 --> 17:37.244
You?

17:38.381 --> 17:40.915
He tried,
but Mama wouldn't let him.

17:40.916 --> 17:43.318
So he turned it all on her.

17:43.319 --> 17:45.654
Peggy, I had no idea.

17:45.655 --> 17:46.854
How could you?

17:46.856 --> 17:47.989
No one knew.

17:47.990 --> 17:49.891
First chance I had,

17:49.892 --> 17:53.094
I lit out of there
and never looked back.

17:53.095 --> 17:54.262
Well, of course.

17:54.263 --> 17:56.164
I mean, what choice
did you have?

17:56.165 --> 17:58.199
I left her there.

17:58.200 --> 18:02.569
She protected me all those years
and I just abandoned her.

18:02.571 --> 18:06.608
I-I'm sure that all your mother
ever really wanted

18:06.609 --> 18:08.009
was for you to be safe.

18:08.010 --> 18:10.210
Who was keeping her safe?

18:11.847 --> 18:13.148
Well, you were a kid.

18:13.149 --> 18:15.215
There was nothing
that you could do about that.

18:15.217 --> 18:17.518
I could've stayed.

18:19.288 --> 18:21.222
Then you wouldn't
have lived the life

18:21.223 --> 18:23.124
that you were supposed to live.

18:23.125 --> 18:25.093
And I never would have met

18:25.094 --> 18:28.729
the strongest woman
that I've ever known...

18:28.731 --> 18:30.964
(sniffles) ...or
my amazing husband.

18:32.802 --> 18:34.636
It's always about you.

18:34.637 --> 18:36.804
(laughs)

18:45.715 --> 18:49.417
Guess that's why I hold on
to Mikey so tight, you know.

18:49.418 --> 18:52.886
I don't want
to abandon anyone ever again.

18:54.090 --> 18:56.624
He knows you're
not going anywhere.

18:56.625 --> 18:59.493
We've both come to
terms with that.

19:13.358 --> 19:15.025
(sniffles)

19:15.026 --> 19:16.859
(footsteps approaching)

19:16.861 --> 19:19.362
What do you think?

19:19.364 --> 19:21.164
I had no idea.

19:22.333 --> 19:26.169
I thought
she was just born mean.

19:26.171 --> 19:28.971
Did you get to the part where
she was hiding under the stairs,

19:28.973 --> 19:30.908
clutching her corn husk doll?

19:30.909 --> 19:32.008
Yeah, yeah.

19:32.010 --> 19:33.944
It was very, very descriptive.

19:33.945 --> 19:35.578
Excuse me.

19:35.580 --> 19:36.779
Where are you going?

19:36.781 --> 19:39.015
I'm gonna go hug my mom.
