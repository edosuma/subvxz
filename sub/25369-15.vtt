You‐‐ You saved us!
You're a hero.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.729
<i>Stay focused. No variables!</i>

12:51.729 --> 12:54.983
<i>This is about me.</i>
<i>About my plans!</i>

12:58.361 --> 13:01.531
[Spider‐Man grunts]
You're coming with me!

13:03.866 --> 13:05.827
[grunts]

13:05.827 --> 13:08.955
[man yelling]
[grunts]

13:08.955 --> 13:11.791
[groans]
D‐Don't hurt me!

13:11.791 --> 13:13.751
[Spider‐Man]
Are you making a request

13:13.751 --> 13:16.713
or quoting
someone else from tonight?

13:16.713 --> 13:19.799
I didn't mean to‐‐
[muffled shouting]

13:21.843 --> 13:25.513
Save your excuses!
[grunts]

13:25.513 --> 13:27.807
All I wanna hear
is your screams!

13:27.807 --> 13:29.475
Huh?

13:29.475 --> 13:31.477
That face!

13:31.477 --> 13:33.479
I remember that face.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.940
What have I done?

13:35.940 --> 13:39.652
My inaction caused
the death of the man
who raised me!

13:39.652 --> 13:44.323
Uncle Ben... I'm so sorry.

13:44.323 --> 13:48.661
What?
I have not allowed myself
to cry in years!

13:48.661 --> 13:49.912
Ugh!

13:49.912 --> 13:54.917
<i>I have made a...</i>
<i>miscalculation.</i>

13:54.917 --> 13:58.921
<i>I believed Parker's body</i>
<i>would simply be a vessel</i>
<i>for my own mind,</i>

13:58.921 --> 14:03.926
<i>but now I share his experiences</i>
<i>as if I'd lived them.</i>

14:03.926 --> 14:07.722
<i>I may not have</i>
<i>made these memories,</i>
<i>but they are in my brain.</i>

14:07.722 --> 14:10.808
<i>They are as much mine now</i>
<i>as they were Parker's.</i>

14:10.808 --> 14:15.146
I believed great power
was only a means to more power.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.774
But now I see that I was wrong.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.901
I cannot,
through my inaction,

14:19.901 --> 14:23.071
allow others to suffer
as Uncle Ben did.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.239
Come in, Silver Sable.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.241
Abort the mission.
Do you read?

14:27.241 --> 14:31.996
If she's already begun,
she's gone into radio silence.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.582
Which means
I have to get to work.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.548
Sable, stop everything.

14:42.548 --> 14:47.470
I, uh‐‐ Ock has decided
we need to abort
the mission immediately.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.014
Nice try,
but I know Ock.

14:50.014 --> 14:53.142
If he wanted
the admission aborted,
he would've come himself.

14:53.142 --> 14:56.604
Yes, well, he'd be here,
but he's... busy,

14:56.604 --> 14:59.023
uh, greeting
his many admirers.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.818
Ock has friends?
[laughs]

15:01.818 --> 15:03.903
Since when? Forget it.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.489
I'm moments away
from final activation.

15:06.489 --> 15:07.990
[beeping]

15:11.536 --> 15:14.497
This plan cannot continue.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.624
Innocent lives
are at stake.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.460
Ha. Otto Octavius?

15:19.460 --> 15:21.587
Caring about innocents?

15:21.587 --> 15:24.966
Sorry, Spider‐Man,
but now I know you're lying.

15:24.966 --> 15:25.967
What?

15:28.886 --> 15:31.597
Hmm. That was
a fatal mistake.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.723
[grunts]

15:37.478 --> 15:39.147
[grunting]

15:39.147 --> 15:41.524
[yells, grunts]

15:44.944 --> 15:46.529
Uh...

15:46.529 --> 15:48.114
Uh...

15:49.532 --> 15:51.242
Oh, yeah.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.536
I forgot about
this part of the plan.

15:53.536 --> 15:56.414
I have Ock on my side
this time, web‐head.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.499
You're out of luck!

15:58.499 --> 16:00.710
Me, attacked by an Octo‐bot?

16:00.710 --> 16:02.461
This is painfully ironic.

16:10.052 --> 16:13.055
[grunts, laughs]

16:13.055 --> 16:16.058
Oh, you might be good,
kid, but Ock is better.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.685
You won't stop us now.
[beeps]

16:17.685 --> 16:21.731
[beeping]

16:21.731 --> 16:25.776
No! The detonator's
timers have started!
[grunts]

16:25.776 --> 16:27.737
Everybody run!

16:27.737 --> 16:30.907
You will pay for your defiance,
Sable!

16:32.742 --> 16:34.327
[grunts]

16:37.663 --> 16:40.458
You are a fine creation,
[grunts]
[beeping]

16:40.458 --> 16:43.920
but I am your master.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.547
How did you‐‐
[grunting]

16:46.547 --> 16:50.134
Let's just say that my
familiarity with Octo‐bot design
[grunting]

16:50.134 --> 16:52.929
allowed me insight
into its weak spots.
[annoyed groan]

16:52.929 --> 16:54.722
It doesn't matter.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.099
Ock's plan will‐‐
[muffled grunt]
[siren approaching]

16:57.099 --> 17:00.228
Your contract
is terminated, shrew.

17:00.228 --> 17:03.481
Hey, Spider‐Man,
how can we help?

17:03.481 --> 17:07.235
It is most fortunate
that you are here.
The danger has not passed.

17:07.235 --> 17:11.030
Get all civilians
clear of this location
by at least 100 yards.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.366
Okay, but what‐‐
Do it now!

17:13.366 --> 17:16.994
Everyone, please clear
the park area immediately!

17:16.994 --> 17:19.038
<i>[Doc Ock's voice, thinking]</i>
<i>I only have mere seconds</i>

17:19.038 --> 17:21.916
<i>before these detonators</i>
<i>start exploding in a series.</i>

17:21.916 --> 17:25.169
<i>A field test for the strength</i>
<i>of my new webs.</i>

17:27.171 --> 17:29.590
[onlookers shout, scream]

17:36.806 --> 17:39.141
[yells]

17:39.141 --> 17:41.227
[grunting, panting]

17:44.939 --> 17:47.692
I've never seen him
so determined.

17:47.692 --> 17:52.113
Is Spider‐Man somehow better
than he used to be?

17:52.113 --> 17:55.324
<i>The last bomb.</i>
<i>If I push this body</i>
<i>to its limits,</i>

17:55.324 --> 17:57.076
<i>I should be able‐‐</i>
My ball!

17:57.076 --> 17:58.119
<i>No!</i>

17:58.119 --> 18:00.162
[panting]

18:00.162 --> 18:02.164
Attention!
You must get clear!

18:02.164 --> 18:04.375
[panting, grunting]

18:04.375 --> 18:07.086
[beeping continues, stops]

18:07.086 --> 18:08.588
Get down!

18:11.132 --> 18:12.717
[bell dings]

18:12.717 --> 18:14.885
[murmuring]

18:17.221 --> 18:19.724
[Peter]
Wow. Everyone looks
so small from up here.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.350
Like little ants.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.895
Yeah, but all
those ants are people,
just like you and me.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.231
Millions of them.
From all over the world.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.151
Each and every one of them
as important as anyone else.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.403
That's why I love
coming up here.

18:32.403 --> 18:35.740
Sometimes it's important
to see things
from a new perspective.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.622
Spider‐Man, you saved
my grandson's life!

18:42.622 --> 18:46.083
I‐‐ I did?

18:46.083 --> 18:48.753
[policeman]
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.546
Thank you, Spider‐Man.

18:50.546 --> 18:53.007
[onlookers cheering]

18:56.052 --> 18:59.138
Um, it is
my understanding

18:59.138 --> 19:01.223
that this kind
of social situation

19:01.223 --> 19:04.268
requires me to say,
"You are"‐‐

19:04.268 --> 19:06.937
My hero, Spider‐Man.
Huh?

19:06.937 --> 19:10.358
You're welcome.

19:10.358 --> 19:13.569
<i>My own father taught me</i>
<i>everyone else in the world</i>
<i>is beneath me,</i>

19:13.569 --> 19:17.281
<i>but I now see Parker's</i>
<i>Uncle Ben was correct.</i>

19:17.281 --> 19:19.784
<i>Every one of these people</i>
<i>are important.</i>
[chattering]

19:19.784 --> 19:23.871
<i>Like a fool,</i>
<i>I thought I was the constant</i>
<i>in my life's equation‐‐</i>

19:23.871 --> 19:25.373
<i>that nothing could change me.</i>

19:25.373 --> 19:27.958
<i>But I never realized</i>
<i>that variables,</i>

19:27.958 --> 19:30.878
<i>such as sharing all of</i>
<i>Peter Parker's experiences</i>

19:30.878 --> 19:33.339
<i>would not only effect</i>
<i>my life's equation,</i>

19:33.339 --> 19:35.549
<i>but improve it.</i>

19:38.135 --> 19:41.347
Despite the preposterousness
of this formula,

19:41.347 --> 19:43.432
there is a certain truth to it.

19:43.432 --> 19:47.728
Great power does equate
with great responsibility.

19:47.728 --> 19:51.315
Otto Octavius will become

19:51.315 --> 19:54.902
the Superior Spider‐Man.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.616
Mmm.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.414
Ah, steak dinner.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.416
They don't got these
in the slammer.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.751
I'd have given up
any one of youse
just to smell one.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.294
[sniffs]

20:12.294 --> 20:14.547
Oh! <i>Buonissima!</i>

20:14.547 --> 20:18.759
Uh, aren't you worried
Spider‐Man might
track you down again,

20:18.759 --> 20:20.261
throw us all behind bars?

20:20.261 --> 20:22.388
Spider‐Man?!
[laughs]

20:22.388 --> 20:24.974
I tell you what, that clown
in those clown pajamas

20:24.974 --> 20:26.976
had the chance to stop me
when I was breaking out.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.478
Guess what he did.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.355
Stopped you?

20:31.355 --> 20:33.858
No, he didn't stop me,
ya lunk!

20:33.858 --> 20:35.735
I'm sitting right here
in front of ya.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.862
If I could turn
your stupidity into energy,

20:37.862 --> 20:40.781
I could power this city.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.617
[scoffs]
Spider‐Man just let me go.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.745
Turned his back
and webbed off.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.414
We ain't got nothing
to worry about from him,
I tell you what.

20:48.414 --> 20:51.208
Now pass the bÃ©arnaise.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.045
Huh?
Wha‐‐
What's happenin'?

20:55.045 --> 20:57.423
[grunting]

20:58.424 --> 21:00.426
[cries out]

21:00.426 --> 21:02.887
[grunts, groans]

21:02.887 --> 21:04.847
Spider‐Man!

21:04.847 --> 21:08.309
Since when do you
enter a room without
making a bad joke?

21:08.309 --> 21:10.311
That was then,
Hammerhead.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.730
This is now!
[blow lands]

21:15.107 --> 21:18.277
Well, we're gonna have to get
the Neuro‐Cortex
out of this housing

21:18.277 --> 21:20.196
and get it back to Horizon.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.907
I hope it's not damaged
beyond repair.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.367
[gasping]

21:30.539 --> 21:31.373
Where am I?
