Anybody want a beverage?

00:26.287 --> 00:27.505
I have the thirst.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.855
- Me too, yo.
- A beverage sounds good, yeah.

00:29.899 --> 00:30.943
How about some water?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.252
Nah, no flavor.

00:36.384 --> 00:37.950
Orange juice?

00:39.648 --> 00:43.565
Bro, that's just fruit
pretending to be a drink. Come on.

00:44.696 --> 00:45.697
Milk?

00:48.004 --> 00:50.963
I dare not drink the
lactations of the dairy cow.

00:54.228 --> 00:57.231
Maybe we got some lemonade
dust packets up in here.

00:57.274 --> 00:59.885
Oh, how about some tea?

00:59.929 --> 01:02.758
How's am I supposed to drink a
little bag with some dirt in it?

01:02.801 --> 01:04.803
It's not dirt.
Those are leaves.

01:06.631 --> 01:07.763
Oh.

01:07.806 --> 01:09.504
Uh...

01:09.547 --> 01:11.419
How's am I supposed to drink a
little bag with some leaves in it?

01:11.462 --> 01:13.421
You don't drink the bag, dude.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.205
You dunk it in some hot water.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.380
Then all that leafy goodness

01:16.424 --> 01:18.252
gets in there
and you drink that.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.515
Like the delicious
hot water salad.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.171
I like salad!

01:24.214 --> 01:25.389
Then let's drink this tea, son!

01:37.184 --> 01:40.056
What in the name of America
the beautiful are you doing?

01:40.100 --> 01:42.841
Oh, just drinking
this hot salad water, yo.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.147
He means tea.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.670
I know what he means.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.586
What I don't know is who
brought it into the Tower!

01:48.630 --> 01:50.197
- I don't know.
- It was not the me.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.894
Who? Answer me.

01:51.937 --> 01:53.504
Calm down, dude.
What's the big deal?

01:53.548 --> 01:55.680
You were about to drink tea!

01:56.203 --> 01:57.595
Tea!

01:57.639 --> 02:00.120
The national beverage
of Great Britain!

02:01.947 --> 02:04.211
Do I really need
to spell it out for you?

02:04.863 --> 02:06.038
Yes.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.346
It all started back in 1776...

02:09.390 --> 02:11.043
Is this going
to be a math story?

02:11.087 --> 02:12.175
Quiet!

02:12.219 --> 02:14.308
It all started back in 1776.

02:14.351 --> 02:17.093
The British Empire once ruled
the American colonies.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.009
British soldiers could stay
in anyone's house, anytime,

02:20.052 --> 02:21.619
and the taxes were super unfair.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.230
But worse than that,

02:23.273 --> 02:25.232
everyone was forced
to drink tea all the time.

02:25.275 --> 02:27.582
Soda was not allowed. It was terrible.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.279
Finally, George Washington

02:29.323 --> 02:30.802
and the Founding Fathers
had enough.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.978
With the help
of the mighty bald eagle,

02:34.328 --> 02:36.547
and the Statue of Liberty,

02:36.591 --> 02:39.289
they declared independence, and
threw all the tea into the ocean.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.682
Without their tea,

02:40.725 --> 02:42.684
the British army didn't
stand a chance.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.904
And America could drink
all the soda it wanted.

02:47.341 --> 02:50.213
Of course, ever since
their humiliating defeat,

02:52.215 --> 02:55.479
the English have been working to
regain control of the United States.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.916
And that tea is their way in!

02:57.960 --> 03:00.441
Robin, it's just
a hot water salad.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.617
It's treason! Treason, I say!

03:02.660 --> 03:04.836
And I'm going to put
it where it belongs!

03:07.752 --> 03:08.884
Aw...

03:08.927 --> 03:10.277
Forget the tea.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.669
You're Americans.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.716
You need something
with a little sugar in it.

03:18.328 --> 03:21.766
I suppose we will never
enjoy the hot leaf water.

03:21.810 --> 03:24.247
Yeah, I guess you're...
Whoa! Look!

03:24.291 --> 03:26.293
Where did it come from?

03:26.336 --> 03:27.685
It is the sign.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.340
We are meant
to drink of the tea!

03:30.384 --> 03:32.124
Uh, I don't know, guys.

03:32.168 --> 03:33.474
This is kind of suspicious.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.215
What if Robin was right?

03:35.258 --> 03:37.391
Oh, come on.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.523
When has we ever been warned
about doing a thing,

03:39.567 --> 03:43.266
and then that thing ended up being
bad and getting us in trouble?

03:43.310 --> 03:44.963
Come to think
of it, I can't think of it.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.487
- Can't think of a single time.
- Yeah, I got nothing.

03:46.530 --> 03:48.358
So, let's drink this tea, yo.

03:55.409 --> 03:56.758
Hmm.

03:56.801 --> 03:58.542
Yeah, there's really
not a lot of flavor in this.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.762
Oh, it may taste like nothings,

04:00.805 --> 04:02.198
but it sure makes me feel

04:02.242 --> 04:04.331
like a dude
of international situations.

04:06.855 --> 04:11.163
True, and the soggy leaf bag
is quite the special treat.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.429
Care for some more?

04:15.472 --> 04:16.691
Oh, why not?

04:24.438 --> 04:26.396
Good morning, Titans.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.876
'Ello, Robin.

04:27.919 --> 04:30.008
Did you forget the "h" in hello?

04:30.052 --> 04:32.359
Join us.
We are watching the telly.

04:32.402 --> 04:33.664
Telly?

04:33.708 --> 04:36.363
Who calls the TV a telly?
Oh, no.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.758
Cyborg, what are
you making for breakfast?

04:40.802 --> 04:43.500
Bacon, eggs, toast, hash browns.

04:43.544 --> 04:44.893
Good. Good, good, good.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.677
An all-American way
to start the day.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.331
And over here, you got
your black pudding,

04:48.375 --> 04:50.725
baked beans, mushrooms
and a half a tomato.

04:50.768 --> 04:53.467
That's a full English breakfast!

04:54.555 --> 04:56.121
You drank the tea!

04:56.165 --> 04:59.299
- Of course we drank the tea.
- But I threw it in the ocean.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.213
Like any good American would.

05:01.257 --> 05:02.345
Well, we got some more.

05:02.389 --> 05:05.435
Oh, my worst nightmare
is coming true.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.568
You're becoming Anglophiles.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.874
Hang low style?

05:09.918 --> 05:11.311
Anglophiles!

05:11.354 --> 05:12.964
People who love Great Britain.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.271
- What's not to love?
- Everything!

05:15.315 --> 05:17.621
There's nothing great
about Great Britain.

05:17.665 --> 05:20.102
The tea has warped your minds.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.669
We are Americans.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.453
And I am going
to make you remember.

America!

06:30.607 --> 06:33.131
USA! USA! USA!

06:33.175 --> 06:35.699
All right, my fellow Americans.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.441
Who's ready to shoot
off these fireworks?

06:38.485 --> 06:41.357
USA! USA! USA!

06:42.402 --> 06:43.664
What is that?

06:43.707 --> 06:44.839
It looks like tyranny.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.762
Easy!

07:02.987 --> 07:04.032
Titans.

07:04.075 --> 07:06.426
What happened
to being Americans?

07:06.469 --> 07:09.298
- Just having a laugh, mate. Biscuit?
- No!

07:09.341 --> 07:13.041
- You're all out of sorts.
- Join us for a spot of tea, love?

07:17.132 --> 07:18.655
I will not!

07:18.699 --> 07:20.309
Where are you getting
all this tea?

07:20.352 --> 07:23.530
She said, "Join us
for a spot of tea."

07:37.413 --> 07:39.197
So much tea!

07:39.241 --> 07:40.764
Lovely, isn't it?

07:40.808 --> 07:42.636
The Queen of England.

07:42.679 --> 07:45.595
You've been bringing tea into
the Tower this whole time!

07:45.639 --> 07:46.770
Bob's your uncle.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.468
I don't have an uncle!

07:48.511 --> 07:52.472
It simply means,
"You're right, young man."

07:52.515 --> 07:54.691
Americans! Yes!

07:54.735 --> 07:58.303
I planted the tea.
Now the Titans are mine.

07:58.347 --> 08:01.089
They will distribute
this tea to all of America.

08:01.132 --> 08:04.658
And once every citizen
is under my control,

08:04.701 --> 08:10.141
the United States will finally
return to the British Empire.

08:10.185 --> 08:13.623
Oh! Still angry about
American independence, I see.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.146
Of course not!

08:15.190 --> 08:16.974
Then tell me
why you're doing this.

08:17.018 --> 08:20.412
Because your forefathers threw
good tea in the ocean.

08:20.456 --> 08:23.851
Nothing upsets the English
more than wasting good tea.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.766
Frightful business!

08:25.809 --> 08:28.116
Unforgivable! Really!

08:28.159 --> 08:29.813
You won't get away with this!

08:29.857 --> 08:31.728
Too late, young man.

08:31.772 --> 08:34.339
Titans! Would you kindly
dispose of him?

08:34.775 --> 08:36.472
Yes, ma'am.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.305
All right, what are
you going on about?

08:43.348 --> 08:45.742
I'm calling upon
America's oldest ally.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.756
Your little birdie is no match

08:59.800 --> 09:03.064
for the biggest clock
in the world!

09:10.724 --> 09:13.683
Let's do this.
These truths are self-evident.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.120
Life!

09:17.426 --> 09:18.427
Liberty!

09:19.210 --> 09:21.082
And the pursuit of happiness!

09:24.172 --> 09:26.000
Biscuit barrage!

09:30.874 --> 09:33.442
Oh, you don't fancy
the biscuits, do you?

09:33.485 --> 09:37.185
How about some
double-decker destruction?

09:45.672 --> 09:48.457
I've had quite enough
of you Americans.

09:48.500 --> 09:52.374
- Time to finish this!
- Not so fast.

09:58.989 --> 10:01.601
Lady Liberty!

10:04.429 --> 10:05.866
No!

10:05.909 --> 10:07.476
Not soda!

10:09.565 --> 10:13.047
You won again, America,
but we'll be back.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.658
That's our promise!

10:17.965 --> 10:19.706
Thanks for the help,
Lady Liberty.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.928
What happened?

10:24.972 --> 10:28.192
It's like a terrible dream
filled with salt and vinegar.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.411
And mushy peas!

10:29.454 --> 10:31.805
We did not know
the dangers of the tea.

10:31.848 --> 10:34.459
We will never drink
of its terrible leaves again.

10:34.503 --> 10:38.638
Sorry, Titans. But there's still
one tea party we have to attend.

10:39.769 --> 10:43.294
- Yeah! USA!
- USA! USA! USA!

10:43.338 --> 10:44.513
Yay! Hurrah!

10:44.556 --> 10:46.733
America the beautiful!

10:46.776 --> 10:47.690
Yay, America!

10:47.734 --> 10:50.519
America! Heck, yeah!
