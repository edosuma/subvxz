00:14.077 --> 00:16.087
All right, what's with the getup?

00:16.088 --> 00:17.158
What, this?

00:17.159 --> 00:20.411
Oh, just enjoying some of my
past mother's day gifts...

00:20.412 --> 00:22.552
My awesome yellow pants,

00:22.553 --> 00:25.345
my "First Mom on the Moon" t-shirt,

00:25.346 --> 00:27.516
and, of course, my macaroni
necklace that says,

00:27.517 --> 00:29.270
"to mom, love Keira."

00:29.271 --> 00:31.106
I can only feel bad for Keira's mom.

00:31.107 --> 00:32.539
Who knows what she got?

00:32.540 --> 00:33.987
Okay, I get it. I get it.

00:33.988 --> 00:35.628
We may not have always
hit it out of the park,

00:35.629 --> 00:38.612
but I got plenty of time
this year to get it right.

00:38.613 --> 00:40.594
- When is mother's day?
- Sunday.

00:40.595 --> 00:43.073
And my mom's coming down,
so it better not be lame.

00:43.074 --> 00:44.307
Oh, not a chance of that.

00:44.308 --> 00:46.243
If anything, I'm worried
it's gonna be too good,

00:46.244 --> 00:48.413
so just be prepared to
get everything you want.

00:48.414 --> 00:49.657
What exactly do you want?

00:49.658 --> 00:51.328
[Scoffs] You suck.

00:51.329 --> 00:52.868
My country 'tis of tea...

00:52.869 --> 00:54.252
You know the little tea place we pass by

00:54.253 --> 00:55.455
and I always say is so cute?

00:55.456 --> 00:58.799
Well, I heard that they are
having a proper afternoon tea

00:58.800 --> 00:59.900
for mother's day...

00:59.901 --> 01:02.736
Finger sandwiches and cloth napkins.

01:02.737 --> 01:05.096
It's gonna be very classy and very elegant,

01:05.098 --> 01:06.370
and that's what I want.

01:06.371 --> 01:08.142
- Since when do you drink tea?
- [Scoffs]

01:08.143 --> 01:09.798
You know, I have a whole other life

01:09.799 --> 01:11.274
that you don't even know about, okay?

01:11.275 --> 01:12.673
I like tea. Fine.

01:12.674 --> 01:14.126
I'll take care of it.

01:14.127 --> 01:15.902
- Quick question... do I have to go?
- Yes.

01:15.903 --> 01:17.919
Good, 'cause I want to go.

01:21.578 --> 01:24.017
Okay, apparently mother's day is Sunday,

01:24.018 --> 01:25.823
and this year, you got
to kick it up a notch.

01:25.824 --> 01:26.885
Excuse me.

01:26.886 --> 01:28.988
Why do we never have secret
meetings in my room?

01:28.989 --> 01:30.257
'Cause your brother's feet stink.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.812
Oh. Really? I don't smell it.

01:32.813 --> 01:34.224
Just take our word for it.

01:34.225 --> 01:35.328
Okay, guys, here's the deal.

01:35.329 --> 01:38.020
She's your mom, so this year
you guys are getting the gift.

01:38.021 --> 01:39.639
- [Groans]
- Oh, what the... [scoffs]

01:39.640 --> 01:42.721
Hey, you're grown up now.
You're 21. You're 18.

01:42.722 --> 01:45.017
- You're...
- Really, dad?

01:45.018 --> 01:46.191
You know how old you are.

01:46.192 --> 01:48.868
And we got to do better than
the "Mom on the Moon" t-shirt.

01:48.869 --> 01:51.390
- That's the bar.
- Oh, that shirt was awesome.

01:51.391 --> 01:53.545
Hey, I saw this "cave mom"
one with a cave lady...

01:53.546 --> 01:55.411
No, no mom t-shirts of any kind.

01:55.412 --> 01:56.968
You guys got to bring it this year.

01:56.969 --> 01:58.774
I got my job. I'm booking the reservation

01:58.775 --> 02:00.194
at the tea place she wants to go to.

02:00.195 --> 02:02.316
And, yes, we all have to go. I checked.

02:02.317 --> 02:03.871
Now get cracking on that gift.

02:03.872 --> 02:05.015
[Clears throat]

02:08.954 --> 02:12.706
So, mom, if you were to win the
lottery for, say, 15 bucks,

02:12.707 --> 02:14.308
what would you splurge on?

02:14.309 --> 02:16.744
- $15, huh?
- Yikes.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.112
You got to get your dad to chip in.

02:18.113 --> 02:19.569
Yeah.

02:19.570 --> 02:22.429
Ooh, I saw they sent the course
catalogue from east indy state.

02:22.430 --> 02:24.227
Yeah! Oh, my god.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.405
They have such interesting classes.

02:26.406 --> 02:28.368
I know I said I wanted
to be a psychologist,

02:28.369 --> 02:30.869
but it would be so fun to be a vet.

02:30.870 --> 02:32.500
But I hear that's really hard.

02:32.501 --> 02:34.507
Sue, don't limit yourself.

02:34.508 --> 02:37.098
If there's something you
decide to do, go for it.

02:37.435 --> 02:39.667
- Really?
- Oh, absolutely.

02:39.668 --> 02:41.635
You know, my mom was always telling me

02:41.636 --> 02:43.638
to play it safe and be practical,

02:43.639 --> 02:45.487
so I said to myself when I had kids,

02:45.488 --> 02:47.483
I would not limit them that way.

02:47.484 --> 02:49.298
So, to hell with practical, Sue.

02:49.299 --> 02:51.567
Your future is wide open.

02:51.568 --> 02:53.047
You got to reach for the stars.

02:53.048 --> 02:56.358
"Paging Dr. Sue Sue Heck.
The elephant is sick."

02:56.359 --> 02:58.477
- [Chuckles]
- How about you?

02:58.478 --> 03:00.525
When you're a mom, is there
anything you'd do different?

03:00.526 --> 03:01.664
What do you mean?

03:01.665 --> 03:03.334
Well, you know, my mom always did things

03:03.335 --> 03:05.259
I said I'd never do as a parent.

03:05.260 --> 03:08.062
So are there things you'd do different
from me when you have kids?

03:08.063 --> 03:10.064
Oh, no. Mom, you're perfect.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.632
[Laughs]

03:11.633 --> 03:14.034
I don't know about perfect, but...

03:14.035 --> 03:15.903
No, really, there's nothing you'd change?

03:15.904 --> 03:18.038
Nope.

03:18.039 --> 03:21.041
Well, I guess sometimes I wish
you'd been more organized.

03:21.042 --> 03:23.143
Oh. Okay.

03:23.144 --> 03:24.712
Just 'cause I remember

03:24.713 --> 03:26.680
never having the permission
slips to go on field trips,

03:26.681 --> 03:29.033
and it'd be kind of embarrassing
'cause I was the only one.

03:29.034 --> 03:31.535
Or sometimes when I would
try out for things,

03:31.536 --> 03:33.137
I wouldn't have what I needed,

03:33.138 --> 03:36.040
so instead of pom-poms, I
would have to do a cheer

03:36.041 --> 03:37.408
waving around a pair of dirty gym socks.

03:37.409 --> 03:39.410
Okay, got it, got it, got it.

03:39.411 --> 03:40.945
So, yeah.

03:40.946 --> 03:43.847
I guess I just think it'd be
super important to be organized.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.149
That's the kind of mom I'd want to be.

03:45.150 --> 03:46.417
Okay, good.

03:46.418 --> 03:47.851
I really need to concentrate
on my driving right now.

03:47.852 --> 03:48.853
Okay.

03:50.922 --> 03:53.591
Yeah, I'm calling 'cause I want
to make a reservation for six

03:53.592 --> 03:54.992
for this Sunday.

03:54.993 --> 03:56.393
For our mother's day afternoon tea?

03:56.394 --> 03:58.028
Oh, you'll have to do that online.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.998
Oh, but can't you just do it?

04:00.999 --> 04:02.866
We don't take phone reservations.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.969
But I'm talking to you right now.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.537
If... if you don't take reservations,

04:06.538 --> 04:08.038
why did you even pick up the phone?

04:08.039 --> 04:09.373
To answer questions.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.542
Okay, here's a question.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.978
Can I have a reservation
for six this Sunday?

04:13.979 --> 04:15.946
No, see, we like to route everybody online.

04:15.947 --> 04:17.548
We find it much more convenient that way.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.882
Oh, I see someone just
took a table for six.

04:19.884 --> 04:20.884
Was that you?

04:20.885 --> 04:22.853
No. I mean, yes.

04:22.854 --> 04:24.154
Yep, that was me.

04:24.155 --> 04:26.023
I think you'll find it much more convenient

04:26.024 --> 04:27.157
to just get online.

04:27.158 --> 04:28.359
- [Dial tone]
- [Sighs]

04:28.360 --> 04:29.961
- [Telephone beeps]
- [Door opens, closes]

04:31.596 --> 04:34.164
Well, it's official.

04:34.165 --> 04:35.366
I'm a crappy mom.

04:35.367 --> 04:36.967
Does this mean Sunday's off?

04:36.968 --> 04:38.235
I'm serious, Mike.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.970
I was talking to Sue, and I'd asked her

04:39.971 --> 04:41.972
if there was anything different
she'd do when she had kids...

04:41.973 --> 04:44.041
Why do you go looking for trouble?

04:44.042 --> 04:46.010
And she said she'd be more organized.

04:46.011 --> 04:48.012
[Sighs] And do you blame her?

04:48.013 --> 04:50.214
I mean, when you're
auditioning for "Cabaret"

04:50.215 --> 04:51.515
with only one character shoe

04:51.516 --> 04:53.417
'cause your mom forgot to put
the other shoe in your bag,

04:53.418 --> 04:54.952
who do you think's gonna get the part?

04:54.953 --> 04:56.954
The girl with the good mom, not Sue.

04:56.955 --> 04:58.555
Maybe it made her stronger?

04:58.556 --> 04:59.556
[Scoffs]

04:59.557 --> 05:01.425
That's B.S., and you know it.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.559
Look at this drawer.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.962
Yep, this is the kind of mother I am.

05:04.963 --> 05:08.032
Oh, silverware, panty liners,

05:08.033 --> 05:09.833
stamps, a roll of film...

05:09.834 --> 05:11.869
Oh, my fitbit!

05:11.870 --> 05:13.191
Frankie, it's the junk drawer.

05:13.192 --> 05:15.039
You know what? These
aren't the junk drawers.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.540
This is the junk drawer.

05:16.541 --> 05:18.108
Yeah, happy mother's day, Frankie.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.443
You screwed up your kid,
and that's something you'll have

05:19.444 --> 05:20.944
to live with for the rest of your life.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.615
Hey, did you peek at the card we got you?

05:30.272 --> 05:32.807
Okay, let's all get out our lists.

05:32.808 --> 05:34.041
Really, guys?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.109
Sue, it's not that hard.

05:35.110 --> 05:36.811
Let's just get her some food she likes.

05:36.812 --> 05:38.713
She does like ham and frosting.

05:38.714 --> 05:39.947
Let's get her ham and frosting.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.148
We could make her ham-frosting rolls.

05:41.149 --> 05:43.251
- Boom. Done.
- Perfect.

05:43.252 --> 05:45.119
Yeah, that sounds like a wonderful tribute

05:45.120 --> 05:46.854
to the woman who can't even
wear a two-piece anymore

05:46.855 --> 05:49.323
because of the stretch
marks we left her with.

05:49.324 --> 05:51.192
Fine. Un-boom. Not done.

05:51.193 --> 05:52.693
Yeah.

05:52.694 --> 05:55.263
Hey. Hello. Check this out.

05:55.264 --> 05:57.798
Could they make it any easier for us?

05:57.799 --> 05:59.867
Pre-selected mom gifts right in this bin.

05:59.868 --> 06:02.169
- How about cowboy-boot cleaner?
- I love it.

06:02.170 --> 06:03.237
What do you say, Sue?

06:03.238 --> 06:04.306
- I really think this is it.
- Mm.

06:05.107 --> 06:06.807
All right.

06:06.808 --> 06:08.976
Um... Ooh.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.378
What about this?

06:10.379 --> 06:12.847
A bowl for watermelon that
looks like a watermelon?

06:12.848 --> 06:14.782
No, I specifically remember mom saying

06:14.783 --> 06:17.819
she does not like bowls for
things that look like the thing.

06:19.321 --> 06:21.889
[Gasps] Wow. Hey, check this out.

06:21.890 --> 06:24.725
This is, like, nice.

06:24.726 --> 06:27.428
Magazine rack for the bathroom?

06:27.429 --> 06:28.763
Hmm?

06:28.764 --> 06:31.198
She does have a lot of magazines.

06:31.199 --> 06:33.267
Plus, she's been spending a lot more time

06:33.268 --> 06:34.403
in the bathroom lately.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.305
Hey, we've all noticed.

06:37.406 --> 06:39.807
Sue: Okay, so now we just got
to find the ones she likes

06:39.808 --> 06:41.776
so we can put them in the
rack and wrap them up nice.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.078
Look for anything with Sandra
bullock or the royal baby

06:44.079 --> 06:45.881
or the ones where people
lose half of themselves.

06:47.416 --> 06:48.950
[Gasps] Hey!

06:48.951 --> 06:51.185
Mom and dad have been sneaking
good toilet paper in here.

06:51.186 --> 06:52.653
[Gasps]

06:52.654 --> 06:53.988
It feels like a pillow for your butt.

06:53.989 --> 06:55.923
No wonder dad always comes
out of here whistling.

06:55.924 --> 06:58.359
Hmm.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.928
Oh, my god.

07:00.929 --> 07:03.664
Mom already has a magazine rack.

07:03.665 --> 07:05.099
Ohh!

07:05.100 --> 07:07.268
And it's the exact one we got her!

07:07.269 --> 07:09.437
Oh, just give her the new one

07:09.438 --> 07:10.905
and then take this one to our bathroom.

07:10.906 --> 07:12.306
Nope, nope, nope.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.275
We got to go back right now
and get her something else.

07:14.276 --> 07:15.743
Oh, this is impossible.

07:15.744 --> 07:17.678
The woman already has everything.

07:17.679 --> 07:20.349
Why must we continue to spoil her?

07:23.151 --> 07:25.386
Oh, Axl, can I ask you something?

07:25.387 --> 07:26.988
Now, I promise I won't judge you.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.723
This is a completely safe space.

07:28.724 --> 07:30.358
I'm just curious, as a parent,

07:30.359 --> 07:32.360
is there anything you would
do differently from me

07:32.361 --> 07:33.794
when you have kids?

07:33.795 --> 07:35.730
You are completely stubborn,

07:35.731 --> 07:37.733
and you refuse to listen to reason.

07:39.701 --> 07:41.702
Don't have to answer right away!

07:41.703 --> 07:43.971
Take your time and get back to me.

07:43.972 --> 07:46.741
Okay, it's hard to know
what she has in that house,

07:46.742 --> 07:48.976
so let's just get her something personal.

07:48.977 --> 07:52.013
Hey, this looks like a real diamond,

07:52.014 --> 07:53.214
and it's only 7 bucks.

07:53.215 --> 07:54.915
When have you ever seen a real diamond?

07:54.916 --> 07:56.318
When has mom?

07:57.686 --> 07:58.886
Ooh.

07:58.887 --> 08:00.287
This turquoise looks pretty.

08:00.288 --> 08:01.656
It'll match her eyes.

08:01.657 --> 08:03.658
Mom doesn't have blue eyes.

08:03.659 --> 08:05.126
Yeah, but she does have
that blue vein in her neck

08:05.127 --> 08:06.727
- when she gets mad.
- [Gasps] Right.

08:06.728 --> 08:07.928
Oh, perfect.

08:07.929 --> 08:10.197
30 bucks, and it'll match her mad vein.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.699
- Done.
- [Squeals]

08:11.700 --> 08:12.701
[Door closes]

08:13.869 --> 08:14.935
Frankie: Hey, kids, look...

08:14.936 --> 08:16.904
I'm finally organizing the junk drawers.

08:16.905 --> 08:18.906
It's never too late to get organized.

08:18.907 --> 08:20.408
And, hey, if you see
anything you want to keep,

08:20.409 --> 08:21.710
you better grab it.

08:22.844 --> 08:25.079
Ugh.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.248
[Sighs, laughs]

08:27.249 --> 08:29.350
Well, it's... oh, look, permission slip.

08:29.351 --> 08:33.184
Oh, which one of you missed
the children's museum?

08:33.655 --> 08:35.155
[Sighs]

08:35.157 --> 08:36.323
Ugh.

08:36.323 --> 08:37.924
Gaudy bracelet from your dad.

08:37.926 --> 08:38.958
I hate turquoise.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.128
He has the worst taste in jewelry.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.216
[Sighs]

08:42.217 --> 08:44.732
Are we seriously having another
secret meeting in your room?

08:44.733 --> 08:47.301
There hasn't been one good
idea generated in here.

08:47.302 --> 08:48.803
Here's an idea... I'm out.

08:48.804 --> 08:50.371
I cannot go back to that store anymore.

08:50.372 --> 08:51.806
I'm just gonna make her something.

08:51.807 --> 08:54.075
Axl, she doesn't want a
buttronauts mother's day card.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.811
[Sighs] Forget it. We don't need him.

08:56.812 --> 08:58.112
We just need a plan.

08:58.113 --> 08:59.980
I am gonna stay in here and make a list,

08:59.981 --> 09:01.882
and you go out and casually check to see

09:01.883 --> 09:04.085
if mom has any candlestick holders.

09:04.086 --> 09:06.721
Mom, do we have any candlestick holders?

09:06.722 --> 09:07.755
Why?

09:07.756 --> 09:09.256
Do you need them for something?
'Cause I can get them.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.858
I don't want you not to have
them if you really need them.

09:10.859 --> 09:11.859
No.

09:11.860 --> 09:14.729
Oh, brick, can I ask you something?

09:14.730 --> 09:16.063
[Sighs] When you have kids,

09:16.064 --> 09:17.965
is there anything you'd do as a parent

09:17.966 --> 09:19.967
that would be different from what I did?

09:19.968 --> 09:21.736
Well, I wouldn't take home the wrong baby.

09:21.737 --> 09:23.437
Okay, technically, that was your dad.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.339
I was whacked out on pain meds.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.808
You do kind of appease us with television.

09:27.809 --> 09:30.211
Oh, and I'd be sure to provide
nutritious, home-cooked meals.

09:30.212 --> 09:32.279
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.148
And sometimes you make us feel like

09:34.149 --> 09:36.417
anytime we ask you to do
something, it's a chore for you.

09:36.418 --> 09:37.685
I wouldn't do that.

09:37.686 --> 09:39.286
And, you know, you're not very organized.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.330
Yeah, Sue already said "not organized."

09:41.331 --> 09:43.290
- I got that one.
- And I would definitely insist

09:43.291 --> 09:44.658
on everyone getting the same chair.

09:44.659 --> 09:46.393
Is that the kind of thing
you were looking for?

09:46.394 --> 09:48.229
Yeah, that's great. That's perfect.

09:48.230 --> 09:50.397
Is there anything you would do the same?

09:50.398 --> 09:51.999
Um...

09:52.000 --> 09:53.802
Can I get back to you on that?

09:55.771 --> 09:59.327
So, listen, I was trying to
make a reservation online,

09:59.328 --> 10:01.408
but I clicked on some Teddy bear,

10:01.409 --> 10:02.676
and now I'm not sure...

10:02.677 --> 10:05.246
Oh, yes, I see you ordered
the "Give me liber-tea"

10:05.247 --> 10:07.222
deluxe 10-piece tea set.

10:07.223 --> 10:09.216
- Is there a problem with it?
- Yeah, there is.

10:09.217 --> 10:12.019
The problem is I didn't mean to order it.
I want to cancel the tea set.

10:12.020 --> 10:14.822
Are you a registered member
of our chamomile club?

10:14.823 --> 10:17.825
Do I sound like I'd be a registered
member of your chamomile club?

10:17.826 --> 10:19.727
Just go back, register as a member,

10:19.728 --> 10:21.095
click on the previous orders,

10:21.096 --> 10:22.696
fill in the form with your address,

10:22.697 --> 10:24.398
and they'll send you a shipping
label to mail it back.

10:24.399 --> 10:25.733
I know you can do it.

10:25.734 --> 10:27.234
My grandma's made a reservation online.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.103
Oh, great. Can you give me her number?

10:29.104 --> 10:31.105
Frankie: So, it was one
day before mother's day,

10:31.106 --> 10:34.675
and it was looking like another clunker.

10:34.676 --> 10:35.843
Oh, brick, hey. Get in here.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.678
We need to talk about mom's present.

10:37.679 --> 10:38.746
No, you come here.

10:38.747 --> 10:39.880
I don't want mom to hear us.

10:39.881 --> 10:41.655
She can't hear us in here, either.

10:41.656 --> 10:44.321
All secret meetings happen in my room.
That's just the way it is.

10:44.322 --> 10:45.337
[Door opens]

10:45.338 --> 10:46.787
- [Gasps] Axl!
- Axl. Hey, get in here.

10:46.788 --> 10:48.355
No, come here. Come here.
[Whistles] Here boy.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.724
What is this, a hallway dork summit?

10:50.725 --> 10:52.726
No, dad is counting on
us to deliver a present,

10:52.727 --> 10:53.727
and we've got bupkis,

10:53.728 --> 10:55.362
so we need to have a
secret emergency meeting

10:55.363 --> 10:57.231
in my room right now.

10:57.232 --> 11:00.968
Well, too bad, suckas.
I already got my present.

11:00.969 --> 11:02.736
A coupon book?

11:02.737 --> 11:05.306
Aren't you a little old for free hugs?

11:05.307 --> 11:07.174
Oh, this is much more than that.

11:07.175 --> 11:09.243
I've got a "one not put the milk back

11:09.244 --> 11:10.644
with just a little bit in it,"

11:10.645 --> 11:12.913
I got "a week of not calling
mom gross and old,"

11:12.914 --> 11:15.716
and a "hold in one fart at
the meal of your choice...

11:15.717 --> 11:16.784
Holidays excluded."

11:16.785 --> 11:18.819
Pbht! That's your gift?

11:18.820 --> 11:20.822
Not acting like a jerk?

11:21.723 --> 11:22.790
Dad is gonna kill you.

11:22.791 --> 11:24.058
[Laughing] Okay.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.660
[Sighs] Yeah, I need back in.

11:27.028 --> 11:28.996
- Axl!
- Axl, come here, come here.

11:28.997 --> 11:30.731
- Come, come on.
- Come on, come on. Come on.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.300
I think you click on the bear.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.769
I tried that. It just keeps
sending me to poems.

11:35.770 --> 11:36.871
I like poems.

11:36.872 --> 11:38.806
Ooh, right here, it says "tea service."

11:38.807 --> 11:40.841
Oh, you would think that means serving tea,

11:40.842 --> 11:42.142
but I learned the hard way

11:42.143 --> 11:44.044
it just orders you pots and saucers.

11:44.045 --> 11:46.647
You know what every mama secretly wants

11:46.648 --> 11:48.282
for mother's day?

11:48.283 --> 11:50.117
- Hmm?
- To feel desired.

11:50.118 --> 11:52.920
No. I think she just wants
some tea and a good present.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.022
You really shouldn't have waited
till the last minute, Mike.

11:55.023 --> 11:56.190
Yeah, thanks, Dave.

11:56.191 --> 11:58.058
I can't figure out which
Teddy bear is my favorite.

11:58.059 --> 11:59.760
I think it's bearjamin Franklin.

11:59.761 --> 12:00.961
Jim, would you cut that out?

12:00.962 --> 12:02.963
You're gonna make me click
on the wrong thing.

12:02.964 --> 12:05.366
Tear out a page from the
book of Chuck, boss man.

12:05.367 --> 12:09.036
Forget the tea... bathe her in champagne.

12:09.037 --> 12:10.371
And then take a strawberry, and you just...

12:10.372 --> 12:11.672
I got it. Thanks.

12:11.673 --> 12:13.073
Hey, you know what?

12:13.074 --> 12:16.211
I think I click on this
tiny sandwich, right?

12:18.079 --> 12:20.214
- Yeah, I think that's it. That's the one.
- Okay, yeah.

12:20.215 --> 12:21.458
- I would go with that, don't you think?
- I'm gonna go for it.

12:21.459 --> 12:23.384
Is that what you would do? I would do that.

12:23.385 --> 12:24.785
I'm in.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.654
- I'm going to tea!
- We're going to tea!

12:26.655 --> 12:27.955
- We're going to tea!
- Hey! We got tea!

12:27.956 --> 12:29.124
[Laughs] We got tea!

12:34.462 --> 12:37.399
[Gasps] Oh, this is darling!

12:37.400 --> 12:38.534
- Right?
- I know.

12:38.535 --> 12:39.768
I've always wanted to come here.

12:39.769 --> 12:42.338
We can thank Mike for making it happen.

12:42.339 --> 12:45.040
Seriously, this wipes away
that breakfast in bed.

12:45.041 --> 12:46.508
Not that ham-frosting rolls

12:46.509 --> 12:47.910
weren't an idea worth trying, really.

12:47.911 --> 12:51.174
Grandma, how come grandpa
tag didn't come today?

12:51.175 --> 12:54.321
His staying home was his
mother's day gift to me.

12:54.322 --> 12:56.590
Oh. Frankly, I can use the break.

12:56.591 --> 12:57.625
[Chuckles]

12:57.626 --> 12:59.647
Happy mother's day.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.582
Uh, we have a reservation for Heck.

13:01.583 --> 13:05.219
Um... I don't think so.

13:05.220 --> 13:07.756
No, there's got to be. Check again.

13:10.192 --> 13:11.692
No, sorry.

13:11.693 --> 13:13.327
Did you use our online reservation?

13:13.328 --> 13:14.595
Yeah. Many times.

13:14.596 --> 13:17.365
And I didn't want to have to
throw my weight around here,

13:17.366 --> 13:20.134
but I'm now a premium member
of the chamomile club,

13:20.135 --> 13:22.637
so I would think that would
get me immediate seating.

13:22.638 --> 13:24.672
Did you print the confirmation e-mail?

13:24.673 --> 13:26.007
[Sighs] Okay, look.

13:26.008 --> 13:27.942
Um [Clears throat] here's the deal.

13:27.943 --> 13:30.678
I've got a very bad track
record with mother's day...

13:30.679 --> 13:33.648
Inflatable foot baths, yellow
pants, you get the idea.

13:33.649 --> 13:35.349
I really need this one to go my way.

13:35.350 --> 13:36.584
You get me?

13:36.585 --> 13:39.687
I'd love to, but we're full.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.923
But good news... your
two tea sets are ready

13:41.924 --> 13:43.858
to be picked up at the gift shop.

13:43.859 --> 13:44.859
Two?

13:44.860 --> 13:45.860
Jim.

13:45.861 --> 13:47.728
I can put you on our waiting list.

13:47.729 --> 13:49.664
Uh, how long's the wait?

13:49.665 --> 13:51.699
Should be about 45 minutes.

13:51.700 --> 13:52.700
[Sighs]

13:52.701 --> 13:54.635
It should be about 10 minutes.

13:54.636 --> 13:55.737
Great. Oh, great.

13:58.874 --> 14:01.575
It's okay, honey. I'm sure
we'll get a table soon.

14:01.576 --> 14:02.810
Oh, no. It's fine.

14:02.811 --> 14:04.912
It's just been a weird mother's day.

14:04.913 --> 14:06.647
The whole week's just been weird.

14:06.648 --> 14:08.015
Why? What happened?

14:08.016 --> 14:09.050
Oh, nothing.

14:09.051 --> 14:10.985
It's just, I-I was talking to Sue,

14:10.986 --> 14:13.721
and we were talking about how
she should follow her dreams,

14:13.722 --> 14:15.856
'cause you never told me to
follow my dreams, and so...

14:15.857 --> 14:18.225
Well, I'm sorry.

14:18.226 --> 14:19.364
No, that's not what I'm saying.

14:19.365 --> 14:20.732
That... that's not the point of my story.

14:20.733 --> 14:22.734
I asked Sue what she would
do differently as a parent,

14:22.735 --> 14:24.068
'cause I think we all have things

14:24.069 --> 14:26.270
we would do differently from our parents,

14:26.271 --> 14:28.239
and she said... certain things,

14:28.240 --> 14:30.808
and it just kind of ended
up hurting my feelings.

14:30.809 --> 14:31.809
Mm.

14:31.810 --> 14:33.077
[Sighs]

14:33.078 --> 14:35.980
I guess I didn't realize you
were so unhappy growing up.

14:35.981 --> 14:37.348
No! No, no!

14:37.349 --> 14:38.816
[Chuckling] You're a great mom.

14:38.817 --> 14:40.051
You're the best.

14:40.052 --> 14:41.753
You were just very practical,

14:41.754 --> 14:43.755
and you didn't want me to get hurt.

14:43.756 --> 14:45.623
Well, I don't know if I was "practical."

14:45.624 --> 14:48.092
I would say realistic.

14:48.093 --> 14:49.394
Fine.

14:49.395 --> 14:51.229
So, you didn't really
encourage me to take risks,

14:51.230 --> 14:52.997
and so I told Sue that's
what I would do differently

14:52.998 --> 14:54.632
as a parent.

14:54.633 --> 14:58.403
I mean, I didn't realize I was
holding you back so much.

14:58.404 --> 15:00.772
That's not what I'm saying!

15:00.773 --> 15:02.006
Oh.

15:02.007 --> 15:04.142
We have a table of six for the Heck party.

15:04.143 --> 15:06.278
[Sighs] I wouldn't call it a party.

15:09.181 --> 15:10.749
[Sighs]

15:15.788 --> 15:18.122
Well, here we are, having
tea on mother's day,

15:18.123 --> 15:20.391
just like you wanted.

15:20.392 --> 15:23.061
Uh, excuse me. Could we get some
buffalo wings for the table?

15:23.062 --> 15:24.729
Spicy or mild, maybe half and half?

15:24.730 --> 15:25.897
Axl!

15:25.898 --> 15:27.065
Oh, sorry, mom. It's your day.

15:27.066 --> 15:28.633
Spicy or mild?

15:28.634 --> 15:29.634
[Sighs]

15:29.635 --> 15:31.836
Great. Now we just need five more of those.

15:31.837 --> 15:33.271
That's for the whole table.

15:33.272 --> 15:35.740
Oh. No, no.

15:35.741 --> 15:37.041
You have to wait for the tea.

15:37.042 --> 15:39.343
Well, I hope we get to eat soon.

15:39.344 --> 15:42.113
I don't know how much longer I can stay.

15:42.114 --> 15:44.615
I can't drive in the dark.

15:44.616 --> 15:46.617
Mom, when I said that,

15:46.618 --> 15:47.652
- I didn't mean...
- [Cellphone vibrates]

15:47.653 --> 15:49.887
Oh.

15:49.888 --> 15:51.656
Hi, Janet.

15:51.657 --> 15:54.025
Aww, you too.

15:54.026 --> 15:56.727
Oh, we're in some restaurant Mike found.

15:56.728 --> 15:58.196
We finally got a seat.

15:58.197 --> 16:01.199
Oh, thank you, yes!

16:01.200 --> 16:03.101
I love cashmere!

16:03.102 --> 16:05.269
I'm wearing it right now.

16:05.270 --> 16:06.838
Uh-huh. [Chuckles]

16:06.839 --> 16:08.739
I need your gift. What?

16:08.740 --> 16:10.041
You want to open it right now?

16:10.042 --> 16:11.876
No, I don't have anything for grandma.

16:11.877 --> 16:13.711
I forgot because I was so disorg...

16:13.712 --> 16:15.313
Because I just forgot, okay?

16:15.314 --> 16:16.781
It can happen to anybody!

16:16.782 --> 16:17.882
But we got this for you.

16:17.883 --> 16:19.684
We had meetings. We made lists!

16:19.685 --> 16:20.885
Sue, I need this.

16:20.886 --> 16:23.087
She's talking cashmere sweaters with Janet.

16:23.088 --> 16:25.089
Then we won't have a gift for you.

16:25.090 --> 16:27.758
You giving me a gift I can
give to grandma is my gift.

16:27.759 --> 16:29.260
Just give me the gift!

16:29.261 --> 16:30.661
All right, thanks for calling.

16:30.662 --> 16:32.797
Love you, too. Happy mother's day.

16:32.798 --> 16:34.665
[Cellphone beeps]

16:34.666 --> 16:35.833
Finally.

16:35.834 --> 16:37.068
No, no.

16:37.069 --> 16:39.337
You have to let it steep.

16:39.338 --> 16:41.105
[Sighs]

16:41.106 --> 16:42.974
No, dad. You heard the rules.

16:42.975 --> 16:45.710
What are they gonna do...
throw me in tea jail?

16:45.711 --> 16:47.311
Maybe I'll get a meal there.

16:47.312 --> 16:49.780
Hey, mom, why don't you open your gift?

16:49.781 --> 16:53.719
Oh, hon... thank you!

16:54.887 --> 16:57.689
Oh, such pretty paper.

16:59.625 --> 17:01.727
Let's see...

17:03.328 --> 17:05.695
What are these?

17:05.696 --> 17:08.665
Oh. Those are...

17:08.666 --> 17:09.700
What are they?

17:09.701 --> 17:10.902
Salad hands.

17:10.903 --> 17:12.770
You got me salad hands?

17:12.771 --> 17:14.038
They're salad hands.

17:14.039 --> 17:17.141
Well, I... I certainly don't have any.

17:17.142 --> 17:18.709
They're handmade from real bamboo,

17:18.710 --> 17:21.045
and you can hang them right
off the edge of the bowl.

17:21.046 --> 17:22.246
Frankie: Aren't they great?

17:22.247 --> 17:24.648
You know, you can really... ooh...

17:24.650 --> 17:26.751
Get your hands right into that salad.

17:26.752 --> 17:28.786
[Chuckles] Well, thank you.

17:28.787 --> 17:31.355
So, uh, what did you kids get for your mom?

17:31.356 --> 17:34.725
Oh, actually...

17:34.726 --> 17:35.893
Uh... [clicks tongue]

17:35.894 --> 17:37.628
It's a coupon book!

17:37.629 --> 17:38.729
You're welcome.

17:38.730 --> 17:41.299
[Chuckles] Oh. Aww, look at that.

17:41.300 --> 17:44.769
One "won't scratch my junk
in front of company."

17:44.770 --> 17:46.137
Really?

17:46.138 --> 17:47.972
- Happy mother's day.
- Happy mother's day!

17:47.973 --> 17:49.974
Well, at least your kids are creative.

17:49.975 --> 17:51.642
I raised you to be practical,

17:51.643 --> 17:54.312
so I guess that's why I
got a practical gift.

17:54.313 --> 17:55.646
[Sighs] Mom...

17:55.647 --> 17:56.814
[voice breaking] It's just that my mom

17:56.815 --> 17:58.282
was so flaky and all over the place

17:58.283 --> 18:00.651
that I guess I went in the
opposite direction with you,

18:00.652 --> 18:04.789
and somehow apparently ended
up crushing your dreams.

18:04.790 --> 18:07.325
Mom, don't cry. I still have some dreams.

18:07.326 --> 18:08.793
No, you don't.

18:08.794 --> 18:11.729
You could have done something great,

18:11.730 --> 18:13.899
and instead you just ended
up married to Mike.

18:15.133 --> 18:16.767
Oh, you're fine, Mike.

18:16.768 --> 18:19.136
It's just that, you know,
at one point she said

18:19.137 --> 18:22.640
she was going to do things,
but I said it was hard.

18:22.641 --> 18:25.910
[Crying] Mom, I don't want
you to cry on mother's day.

18:25.911 --> 18:28.279
And I really don't want you to
tell Janet about this, okay?

18:28.280 --> 18:30.248
Oh, mom, I thought of another one.

18:30.249 --> 18:31.782
Whenever I tell you a story about me,

18:31.783 --> 18:33.651
you always spin it into a story about you.

18:33.652 --> 18:34.652
Kkkt!

18:34.653 --> 18:36.254
[Sobbing] Oh, wait.

18:36.255 --> 18:38.723
Is this all because I
called you disorganized?

18:38.724 --> 18:40.091
[Voice breaking] Oh, no.

18:40.092 --> 18:42.326
Because I think you're the best mom ever!

18:42.327 --> 18:43.995
I want to be just like you,

18:43.996 --> 18:46.631
except, you know, maybe I'd make sure

18:46.632 --> 18:49.267
there was food in the fridge
for my kids' lunches.

18:49.268 --> 18:50.701
But that's all!

18:50.702 --> 18:51.969
No, Sue, you were right.

18:51.970 --> 18:54.105
I just don't know what's wrong with me.

18:54.106 --> 18:55.940
I... why can't I get it together?

18:55.941 --> 18:59.810
I didn't even get you a present! I forgot!

18:59.811 --> 19:03.080
Those salad hands weren't for you.
They were for me.

19:03.081 --> 19:06.917
Janet gets you a sweater, and I
just get you a big, fat nothing.

19:06.918 --> 19:10.788
Why are my expectations
for mother's day so high?

19:10.789 --> 19:13.257
It's just a day! Who cares?!

19:13.258 --> 19:14.959
I do the same thing on new year's Eve.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.295
"Oh, everybody put your hats on.
We have to count down."

19:17.296 --> 19:19.630
Just shut up, Frankie!

19:19.631 --> 19:21.065
[Sobs]

19:21.066 --> 19:22.701
Don't shut up.

19:25.837 --> 19:28.239
Dad. [Chuckles]

19:28.240 --> 19:29.707
What are you doing in here?

19:29.708 --> 19:31.642
Well, the way I see it,
I've got two options.

19:31.643 --> 19:33.711
I stay out there, tell
them they're being stupid,

19:33.712 --> 19:35.212
and make them cry... More.

19:35.213 --> 19:38.082
Or hide in the bathroom of a
tea place like a real man.

19:38.083 --> 19:40.018
I see your point.

19:43.155 --> 19:45.156
Whatever happened to never
leave a man behind?

19:45.157 --> 19:47.725
Still all crying and
snot bubbles out there?

19:47.726 --> 19:49.760
I think it's cresting.
They're starting to hug.

19:49.761 --> 19:51.663
Shouldn't be much longer now.

19:53.799 --> 19:56.967
Yep, there were long lines to
get in for tea on mother's day,

19:56.968 --> 19:58.636
but the longest line of all

19:58.637 --> 20:01.272
was the one at the return
counter the day after.

20:01.273 --> 20:03.674
Now, when I return these, I'm
gonna get you something.

20:03.675 --> 20:07.144
- No. I don't deserve it.
- No. I don't deserve it.

20:07.145 --> 20:11.148
Aww. Now, that's kind of pretty.

20:11.149 --> 20:12.717
- Looks like a real diamond.
- Mm.

20:12.718 --> 20:13.884
Why couldn't they have gotten me that?

20:13.885 --> 20:15.619
Next.

20:15.620 --> 20:17.822
Ooh, salad hands.

20:17.823 --> 20:19.724
Seen a lot of these today. [Chuckles]

20:19.725 --> 20:21.625
Who would want to stick
their hands in salad?

20:21.626 --> 20:22.660
I know, right?

20:22.661 --> 20:24.261
It's got Axl written all over it.

20:24.262 --> 20:25.863
Did you say Axl?

20:25.864 --> 20:27.998
I remember that name
'cause it's so unusual.

20:27.999 --> 20:29.767
You have two boys and a girl?

20:29.768 --> 20:30.911
Yes?
Mm-hmm.

20:30.912 --> 20:32.069
They were in here so many times

20:32.070 --> 20:33.871
trying to find the right gift for you.

20:33.872 --> 20:35.306
They really agonized over it.

20:35.307 --> 20:36.941
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:36.942 --> 20:38.709
They said you worked hard

20:38.710 --> 20:40.678
so they wanted to get you something nice.

20:40.679 --> 20:41.946
Aww. That must have been Sue.

20:41.947 --> 20:43.748
No, actually, that was the older boy.

20:43.749 --> 20:45.349
Axl said that?

20:45.350 --> 20:46.617
Yeah.

20:46.618 --> 20:48.853
Oh, and the girl, she was so sweet.

20:48.854 --> 20:50.287
Aww. She was?

20:50.288 --> 20:51.856
Of course she was. [Chuckles]

20:51.857 --> 20:53.724
And they shopped so well together.

20:53.725 --> 20:55.259
Let me tell you... my kids
would have killed each other.

20:55.260 --> 20:57.294
[Chuckles] You did a great job with them.

20:57.295 --> 20:58.629
Someone must have raised you right.

20:58.630 --> 21:00.731
Ah, that's me. I'm her mother.

21:00.732 --> 21:02.032
Oh. Well, good job, grandma.

21:02.033 --> 21:03.200
[Chuckles] Thanks.

21:03.201 --> 21:04.870
So, do you want cash or store credit?

21:06.371 --> 21:07.405
Cash.

21:07.406 --> 21:08.672
My mom and I are gonna go get a drink.

21:08.673 --> 21:09.807
Okay.

21:09.808 --> 21:10.808
[All chuckle]

21:10.809 --> 21:12.076
All right, there you go.

21:12.077 --> 21:13.077
- Thank you.
- All right.

21:13.078 --> 21:15.045
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

21:15.046 --> 21:16.313
You know what I could go for?

21:16.314 --> 21:17.748
One of those long island iced teas.

21:17.749 --> 21:18.849
Frankie: Oh, I love those.

21:18.850 --> 21:20.151
You know where they make them really good?

21:20.152 --> 21:21.252
Don's Oriental.

21:21.253 --> 21:23.255
[Gasps] Let's go!
