WEBVTT

00:01.150 --> 00:02.870
Previously on damages...

00:02.910 --> 00:05.430
The bureau's putting together
a case we'll want patty to take.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.470
We'll use you to monitor
it from the inside.

00:07.490 --> 00:10.090
What is patty's interest in this murder?

00:10.100 --> 00:12.090
I think daniel purcell
and her are friends.

00:12.110 --> 00:14.120
- Well,this is not what we wanted.
- I know.

00:14.310 --> 00:15.690
You owe me.

00:15.710 --> 00:17.450
I owe you nothing.

00:17.470 --> 00:20.700
I'm advising mr. Purcell not
to answer any more questions.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.160
I thought you said you
weren't his attorney.

00:22.170 --> 00:23.230
I am now.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.650
You were found with your wife's body.

00:25.690 --> 00:27.810
There's no sign of forced entry.

00:27.830 --> 00:29.580
Patty,I saw the guy who did it.

00:29.590 --> 00:34.480
Our firm was hired to do toxicity
studies on a chemical compound--

00:34.490 --> 00:35.540
aracite.

00:35.550 --> 00:36.380
Is it toxic?

00:36.400 --> 00:37.370
Extremely.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.630
Do you think your firm killed christine?

00:40.660 --> 00:42.710
They consult for the energy industry.

00:42.740 --> 00:46.380
These companies are
worth billions of dollars.

00:46.410 --> 00:48.730
Hey,mom. You okay?

00:48.740 --> 00:50.590
Michael,this is daniel purcell.

00:50.620 --> 00:51.660
It's good to meet you.

00:51.670 --> 00:54.480
We have a containment problem.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.600
By all means,share.

00:56.620 --> 00:58.070
Claire maddox--
I've heard of her.

00:58.090 --> 01:01.580
She's head counsel of the world's
third largest energy provider.

01:01.610 --> 01:04.480
- Did you tell anyone about us?
- No.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.230
Did you kill your wife?

01:17.150 --> 01:20.610
I had nothing to do with this.

01:22.660 --> 01:25.180
did she find out about us?

01:31.370 --> 01:33.450
No.

01:37.150 --> 01:41.370
Someone leaked your toxicity
report to patty hewes.

01:43.610 --> 01:45.830
I did.

01:46.630 --> 01:48.640
Why?

01:48.650 --> 01:52.100
There are some things I
don't want you to know.

01:52.110 --> 01:55.120
For your protection.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.790
You have got to tell me the truth.

01:59.630 --> 02:02.860
Who is responsible for this?

02:03.960 --> 02:06.790
Who do you think?

02:10.400 --> 02:13.320
This company is killing people.

02:13.330 --> 02:17.210
And that's the guy who calls the shots.

02:17.370 --> 02:20.450
"Walter kendrick,ceo."

02:20.470 --> 02:24.220
Ultima natural resources is
destroying the environment.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.770
West virginia.

02:25.790 --> 02:29.360
Acid rain from coal-burning power
plants have pushed mercury levels

02:29.370 --> 02:32.270
to 87 times the national average.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.450
Residents tried to bring a class action.

02:34.460 --> 02:37.020
The judge threw the case out of court.

02:37.030 --> 02:41.290
So,they've had more than 200 lawsuits
filed against them in the past three years?

02:41.310 --> 02:44.920
And they've lost exactly one of them.

02:44.930 --> 02:48.000
They didn't even bother
to appeal. Know why?

02:48.010 --> 02:49.970
It was for $100 million.

02:49.990 --> 02:53.130
That's two days profit for them.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.040
You're right. This is huge.

02:55.050 --> 02:59.950
But what does it have to
do with defending purcell?

02:59.960 --> 03:03.020
I have no idea whether
daniel killed his wife,

03:03.030 --> 03:08.740
but his consulting firm has worked
for unr for more than a decade.

03:09.610 --> 03:12.220
He must know more than he's telling me.

03:12.230 --> 03:18.570
Look,uh... I'm on board,but
you got to tell me something.

03:20.030 --> 03:23.900
You and purcell obviously
have some kind of past.

03:23.910 --> 03:27.700
Is there something
between you,I need to know?

03:29.690 --> 03:32.440
If there was,I'd tell you.

04:19.810 --> 04:22.089
I'm sorry. What was the question?

04:22.100 --> 04:23.720
Tom shayes.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.640
Why didn't he go
through with the payoff?

04:25.660 --> 04:28.480
He said his conscience
got the better of him.

04:28.510 --> 04:30.150
At the last second?

04:30.160 --> 04:32.950
And patty took him off
the infant mortality case.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.390
- Right before he made the deal.
- Yeah,I know.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.480
I was wondering the same thing,but I don't see how
patty could have known that we were setting tom up.

04:39.490 --> 04:44.710
I think she just wants him on
the purcell case. Excuse me.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.950
What have you guys found on purcell?

04:47.960 --> 04:49.620
We're gonna have to
to put a pin in that.

04:49.630 --> 04:53.810
What? Why? I told you it's the only
thing patty cares about right now.

04:53.820 --> 04:56.450
You have to lay low,ellen.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.720
We need intel.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.700
Why the shayes thing went sideways.

05:00.720 --> 05:05.030
This is just to make sure that we're all
okay cover-wise before we move forward.

05:05.050 --> 05:07.890
My cover's fine. Patty
doesn't suspect a thing.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.490
Just let me see what
I can get on purcell.

05:10.500 --> 05:15.220
Ellen,I know it's frustrating,but
we need you to back off.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.440
We're all gonna leave it alone.

05:17.910 --> 05:22.150
Okay? We'll be in touch.

05:29.340 --> 05:31.830
Don't worry. It's insulin.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.480
I'm a diabetic.

05:39.490 --> 05:40.410
Patty will be here in a minute.

05:40.420 --> 05:43.980
She wanted me to brief you before
your meeting with detective huntley.

05:43.990 --> 05:45.150
Some coffee?

05:45.160 --> 05:47.490
No,thank you.

05:50.720 --> 05:56.630
so,the preliminary autopsy report suggests
that your wife died by strangulation.

05:57.110 --> 06:01.420
There were no signs of sexual
assault,but clearly,there was A...

06:02.190 --> 06:06.430
A... there was A... struggle.

06:18.940 --> 06:22.360
Didn't the police find any
evidence of the guy who killed her?

06:22.900 --> 06:25.410
I'm afraid not.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.460
Patty,I was wondering if I could sit in
on your meeting with detective huntley?

06:33.470 --> 06:34.550
Why?

06:34.590 --> 06:37.880
I thought it would be valuable. I don't
have any experience with criminal law.

06:39.540 --> 06:42.500
I don't think mr. Purcell would
be comfortable with you there.

06:42.510 --> 06:46.050
- Okay.
- And I'm not running a law school.

06:47.780 --> 06:49.580
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:49.590 --> 06:53.970
Mr. Purcell,you filed a police
report,um,several days before the murder,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.590
saying that someone
broke into your house.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.420
That is correct.

06:59.430 --> 07:02.370
Um,was anything stolen on that occasion?

07:02.380 --> 07:04.210
No.

07:04.230 --> 07:07.060
My daughter heard the
intruder and woke me.

07:07.070 --> 07:10.750
We must have chased him out before
he had time to steal anything.

07:11.170 --> 07:15.600
And-and the second intruder-- the
one you believe killed your wife--

07:15.610 --> 07:18.370
he didn't steal anything,either.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.100
Not to my knowledge,no.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.970
Do you think it was the
same man on both occasions?

07:26.980 --> 07:28.410
It could have been.

07:28.420 --> 07:30.380
The first time,it was dark.

07:30.410 --> 07:34.520
He was wearing a hooded sweatshirt.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.340
I really didn'T... see his face.

07:38.350 --> 07:42.000
Right. Well,I read that in the
report. It's just so curious.

07:42.010 --> 07:46.870
You know,two home invasions in
one week,and yet nothing's missing.

07:48.890 --> 07:52.970
You know,late last night,I
was struck by the thought,um,

07:52.980 --> 07:55.760
did someone target the wrong house?

07:55.770 --> 07:59.630
Oh,isn't it your job to
figure that out,detective?

07:59.660 --> 08:00.720
Right,right.

08:00.730 --> 08:05.930
Um,okay,well,describe the man that you
saw the night of the-the second break-in.

08:05.940 --> 08:09.530
I have. Several times.

08:09.540 --> 08:11.490
Right. Let's see.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.070
Shorter than mr. Purcell.

08:14.080 --> 08:18.720
Um,stringy blond hair. A
long-sleeved t-shirt,possibly jeans.

08:19.050 --> 08:24.690
You know,forgive me. I'm just stuck on why someone
would break into a house twice and not steal anything.

08:25.360 --> 08:28.600
There wasn't enough
time to steal anything.

08:29.680 --> 08:33.230
There was barely
enough time to kill her.

08:40.909 --> 08:44.630
May I show you some photos
taken at the crime scene?

08:45.370 --> 08:49.730
I mean,I'M... I'm afraid this
may be difficult to look at.

08:51.470 --> 08:53.740
Anything to help.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.110
We'll see if you see something in
the photos that jogs your memory.

08:56.130 --> 08:58.760
Mr. Purcell isn't here
to be harassed,detective.

08:58.770 --> 09:01.150
He's here to find the
man who killed his wife.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.330
No. It's okay,patty.

09:02.340 --> 09:07.110
Daniel,you do not have to do this.

09:07.120 --> 09:11.230
I'm here to help. I want to do this.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.880
You're okay to continue?

09:32.890 --> 09:38.850
Yeah,I think... I... I think so.

09:41.910 --> 09:45.110
Is there anything out of the ordinary?

10:00.930 --> 10:02.120
No.

10:02.130 --> 10:05.360
Are those the clothes that she
was wearing earlier in the night?

10:06.440 --> 10:08.760
Yes. She was dressed for the gala.

10:08.770 --> 10:11.050
I don't believe you
know my wife christine.

10:11.080 --> 10:14.340
It's really nice to meet you.
I admire your work so much.

10:14.350 --> 10:16.240
Thank you for your support.

10:16.250 --> 10:20.790
What about the kitchen? Was there anything
out of place or different than usual?

10:20.800 --> 10:22.800
No.

10:25.410 --> 10:28.370
What is it,daniel?

10:30.520 --> 10:32.750
What do you see?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.690
Her ring.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.740
- Excuse me?
- Her ring.

10:39.210 --> 10:42.100
She's not wearing it.

10:43.680 --> 10:47.590
I gave it to her on our tenth
anniversary. It's a ruby.

10:48.140 --> 10:50.450
An heirloom.

10:50.470 --> 10:52.080
She always wore it.

10:52.090 --> 10:54.670
- On which hand?
- The right.

10:55.100 --> 11:00.840
Oh,so they stole the
ruby and left the diamond?

11:03.200 --> 11:05.460
Is this the first time
you noticed it missing?

11:06.020 --> 11:09.130
Yes.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.410
Obviously.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.980
This is a very important
development,mr. Purcell.

11:13.990 --> 11:18.610
It is... a big development.

11:19.150 --> 11:22.260
- Yeah,I made a note of it.
- Listen,asshole.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.060
You find that ring,and
you find my wife's killer.

11:26.070 --> 11:28.240
Daniel,calm down.

11:28.250 --> 11:34.670
If you think i killed
her,then just say it!

11:37.070 --> 11:39.640
And we'll know where we stand.

11:39.650 --> 11:41.510
Mr. Purcell,i believe you.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.770
Really?

11:42.780 --> 11:46.640
Because the man who murdered
christine is still out there,

11:46.970 --> 11:49.940
and you have been absolutely useless.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.800
Can we have a few
moments,please,detective?

11:52.810 --> 11:54.630
Oh,sure.

11:55.580 --> 11:56.820
Thank you.

11:56.830 --> 11:59.730
Um,one last question... if I could.

11:59.740 --> 12:03.640
Um,did you ever lay hands on your wife?

12:03.650 --> 12:06.340
Of course not.

12:07.320 --> 12:11.470
Well,according to the state of
new york,she claims otherwise.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.620
Your wife filed a
complaint three years ago.

12:17.660 --> 12:18.960
Where did you get that?

12:19.000 --> 12:24.020
Oh,the same file i found the restraining
order that she had issued against you.

12:24.030 --> 12:25.930
I think we're through here,detective.

12:25.940 --> 12:27.840
- Where did you get those documents?
- Daniel.

12:27.850 --> 12:30.610
Because these were
sealed under court order.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.870
You can't use these against me.

12:32.890 --> 12:35.510
Can you explain the assault
from three years ago?

12:35.540 --> 12:37.060
- Don't answer that.
- No,no,no,no.

12:37.070 --> 12:39.520
- Absolutely,I can explain it.
- Detective,I'm gonna ask you to step out.

12:39.530 --> 12:42.760
- I want to answer this guy.
- Daniel,no!

12:43.080 --> 12:46.260
Don't manage me. I'm
not a goddamned child.

12:46.270 --> 12:49.750
Stop acting like one.

12:50.230 --> 12:53.590
Just shut your mouth and do as i say.

12:53.600 --> 12:57.240
I'm sorry. Uh,do you need a minute?

13:01.610 --> 13:03.600
A restraining order?

13:03.610 --> 13:05.900
How the hell did we screw that up?

13:05.930 --> 13:07.650
It didn't come up on a background check.

13:07.690 --> 13:09.230
Purcell was right.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.570
It was sealed in family court.

13:11.580 --> 13:14.960
I swear to god,he's acting
like he wants to get arrested.

13:14.980 --> 13:18.810
One incident like this three
years ago is not probable cause.

13:18.850 --> 13:22.900
No,but it looks like he's
lying about everything.

13:22.930 --> 13:25.560
I mean,two break-ins,nothing stolen.

13:25.590 --> 13:28.290
Now this new story about a ring.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.110
You don't believe it?

13:30.120 --> 13:32.330
I don't know.

13:32.340 --> 13:35.550
Why don't we turn him over to
a criminal defense attorney?

13:35.560 --> 13:38.290
We'll go after ultima
national resources ourselves.

13:38.320 --> 13:42.040
Because ultima national is bulletproof.

13:42.050 --> 13:46.500
The only way we're gonna get to them
is by having someone on the inside.

13:48.040 --> 13:51.220
I believe daniel has the answers.

14:24.650 --> 14:28.070
{\a6}<i>10 years ago</i>

14:22.930 --> 14:28.400
And what did ibc global's report
conclude about the contaminant?

14:28.410 --> 14:30.550
It was entirely safe.

14:30.580 --> 14:33.520
The contaminant posed no health risk?

14:33.540 --> 14:34.800
None whatsoever.

14:34.820 --> 14:38.330
Even at levels as high
as 100 parts per million,

14:38.340 --> 14:43.990
ibc global claimed it wasn't necessary to
reduce human exposure to the contaminant?

14:44.030 --> 14:47.840
Yes,it was safe even at a
hundred parts per million.

14:48.390 --> 14:53.580
Please mark this as exhibit 19.

15:00.320 --> 15:05.910
Mr. Purcell,who wrote that letter
to your daughter's day care provider?

15:06.620 --> 15:08.360
God.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.430
- Hello?
- You on your way?

15:16.440 --> 15:19.640
Katie? Shit.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.380
- You forgot.
- No,I didn't forget. I just,um...

15:24.390 --> 15:27.750
uh,I got distracted,and I,uh... I...

15:27.760 --> 15:31.190
I totally forgot. I'm so sorry.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.840
You're still at work,aren't you?

15:33.850 --> 15:36.620
Where else? How much longer
are you guys gonna be there?

15:36.630 --> 15:38.580
Until you get your ass
down here and have a drink.

15:38.590 --> 15:40.170
I want you to meet mark.

15:40.180 --> 15:43.100
Me,too. I'll do my best,katie. I'll try.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.290
Okay.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.630
So,who're you blowing off?

15:54.640 --> 15:56.320
David's sister.

15:56.340 --> 15:58.270
Katie connor.

15:58.280 --> 16:00.320
When was the last time you saw her?

16:00.330 --> 16:01.830
David's funeral.

16:01.850 --> 16:06.050
We've spoken on the phone a few
times,but I think she's in denial.

16:06.520 --> 16:09.330
She wants me to meet
the guy she's dating.

16:09.340 --> 16:11.140
Life goes on.

16:11.150 --> 16:13.980
Maybe you should go out.
You might enjoy yourself.

16:14.380 --> 16:16.750
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.760
Hey,tom?

16:19.770 --> 16:24.480
What do you know about the,uh,ibc global
case that patty tried ten years ago?

16:25.210 --> 16:27.450
That was just before my time. Why?

16:27.460 --> 16:31.170
Daniel purcell was a key
witness against patty in it.

16:31.940 --> 16:33.900
She never mentioned it.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.710
Don't you think that's a little strange?

16:36.720 --> 16:42.220
If there's anything we need to know,patty
will tell us... when she's ready.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.660
Ah,jesus.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.450
I stopped by your office.

16:54.470 --> 16:58.080
Doris told me you run
every day at lunch.

16:58.460 --> 17:01.600
Doris should sit at her
desk and keep her mouth shut.

17:02.990 --> 17:05.849
Thanks for getting our
materials back from patty hewes.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.859
You're welcome.

17:08.310 --> 17:10.710
Why didn't you tell me
daniel purcell leaked them?

17:10.720 --> 17:14.270
- Why do you care?
- I didn'T... until his wife turned up dead.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.180
Whatever you've dragged
our company into,

17:16.190 --> 17:19.720
it better not involve anything other
than retrieving stolen documents.

17:20.660 --> 17:23.910
Your insinuation stops
here and now,you understand?

17:24.740 --> 17:29.290
If you're wondering what happened to christine
purcell,take a look at the grieving widower.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.770
You ever meet daniel purcell?

17:32.800 --> 17:34.600
Once or twice.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.200
I've worked with him for years.

17:36.210 --> 17:39.440
He's brilliant,but he's unstable.

17:39.460 --> 17:42.870
He has a violent temper,and
his marriage was a wreck.

17:42.880 --> 17:46.070
My only job is to protect mr. Kendrick,

17:46.090 --> 17:49.470
and if you've done anything to expose
him or ultima national resources...

17:49.480 --> 17:53.060
The police will find the
killer,and when they do...

17:53.900 --> 17:57.120
my money's on purcell.

17:58.980 --> 18:02.540
Claire maddox came to see
me about daniel purcell.

18:02.780 --> 18:03.450
Yeah?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.680
She's asking questions,mr. Kendrick.

18:05.690 --> 18:07.750
Don't worry about
maddox. I'll back her off.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.030
You just handle purcell.

18:09.050 --> 18:10.610
Purcell won't be a problem.

18:10.620 --> 18:13.440
Make sure aracite can't come
back to bite us in the ass.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.630
It can't,mr. Kendrick.

18:14.650 --> 18:18.370
Aracite is a dead issue,but i think
we need to talk about what comes next.

18:18.410 --> 18:20.240
When can you get down to west virginia?

18:20.260 --> 18:22.770
Be on the next flight out.

18:29.780 --> 18:31.850
Everything under control in new york?

18:31.870 --> 18:34.770
- That was wayne suttry.
- Yeah?

18:35.140 --> 18:39.940
Just for peace of mind,step up
security at all of our coal facilities.

18:40.650 --> 18:43.360
Yes,mr. Kendrick.

18:47.070 --> 18:49.950
- Can I help you?
- Daniel purcell for patty hewes.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.410
Just a moment. I'll
see if she's available.

18:53.270 --> 18:54.730
Good morning,mr. Purcell.

18:54.740 --> 18:56.600
It's okay,I can take him back.

18:56.610 --> 19:01.030
Good morning. I'm sorry.
I know we've met,but...

19:01.040 --> 19:02.310
Ellen. Ellen parsons.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.780
Right. Ellen.

19:08.690 --> 19:12.500
I never got a chance to tell
you,I'm deeply sorry about your wife.

19:13.170 --> 19:15.240
Thank you.

19:16.980 --> 19:20.510
I'm sure you know you're in
very good hands with patty.

19:20.990 --> 19:23.690
Yes,I am.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.890
I don't believe a word you say.

19:30.930 --> 19:33.910
I'm telling the truth
about christine's ring.

19:33.920 --> 19:38.140
And about the restraining order?

19:38.810 --> 19:42.850
Or ultima national? Or
those toxicity reports?

19:43.450 --> 19:47.190
I swear to you,patty,I've
told you everything I know.

19:48.950 --> 19:52.310
- You're gonna have to prove it to me.
- How?

19:53.070 --> 19:56.570
You understand this test is just to
verify that you didn't commit the murder?

19:57.360 --> 19:59.580
Yes.

20:00.610 --> 20:04.160
- Are you a scientist?
- Yes.

20:04.170 --> 20:07.910
- Do you have a phd in chemistry?
- Yes.

20:08.340 --> 20:12.770
Did you at any time consult
for ultima national resources?

20:12.780 --> 20:14.430
Yes.

20:14.450 --> 20:20.190
Do you have reason to believe that ultima national
resources was involved in the murder of your wife?

20:20.200 --> 20:22.850
Yes.

20:22.860 --> 20:25.450
Ever think about killing your wife?

20:26.640 --> 20:28.370
No.

20:28.390 --> 20:32.100
It's not a crime to think
about doing bad things.

20:32.110 --> 20:35.040
If it were,I'd be in jail.

20:40.490 --> 20:43.420
did you kill your wife?

20:47.480 --> 20:51.790
Mr. Purcell,did you kill your wife?

20:52.950 --> 20:55.690
No.

20:56.070 --> 20:58.750
Just one final question.

20:58.770 --> 21:02.780
Do you really believe your
wife's ruby ring was stolen?

21:06.210 --> 21:08.810
Yeah... yes.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.060
How did he do?

21:14.080 --> 21:16.400
See for yourself.

21:24.690 --> 21:28.670
<i>Bloomfield*****</i>

21:42.670 --> 21:44.820
Get away from there!

21:47.650 --> 21:49.960
How're you doing?

21:50.240 --> 21:51.850
Mrs. Entwistle?

21:51.870 --> 21:53.190
Do I know you?

21:53.200 --> 21:54.950
Josh reston.

21:54.960 --> 21:58.630
We haven't met,but I knew your pig.

21:58.640 --> 22:02.490
Saw you win a ribbon off him last
year at the clearwater county fair.

22:02.500 --> 22:05.630
Her. That's a sow.

22:05.640 --> 22:09.230
I'm very sorry. How'd she die?

22:10.060 --> 22:12.190
What do you care?

22:12.200 --> 22:16.410
It seems to me a lot of folks are
losing livestock around here lately.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.950
So I heard.

22:19.310 --> 22:22.080
You mind me asking
where you get your water?

22:22.090 --> 22:25.590
Do you think it's contaminated
from the coal plant?

22:26.720 --> 22:29.050
Ma'am...

22:29.880 --> 22:33.300
I'm just trying to figure out what's
happening to these animals here.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.880
You a reporter?

22:35.890 --> 22:38.560
I know you feel like
you can't talk to me...

22:40.320 --> 22:43.310
but you're not alone.

22:43.330 --> 22:46.390
We are all alone here.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.500
Don't fool yourself.

22:49.660 --> 22:50.280
Ma'am...

22:50.290 --> 22:53.880
Get off my property
before I call the sheriff.

23:04.870 --> 23:07.150
I've been looking into patty's history.

23:07.160 --> 23:12.650
17 years ago,she used daniel purcell as an
expert witness,and he helped her win a case.

23:12.660 --> 23:13.620
Yes?

23:13.630 --> 23:15.430
but ten years ago,they
went head-to-head.

23:15.440 --> 23:19.760
She and purcell were on opposite
sides of the ibc global case.

23:20.690 --> 23:23.210
I saw your name on the
casase file,mr. Nye.

23:23.250 --> 23:25.090
You were defense counsel for ibc.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.970
I was part of the team,yes.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.850
I assume you have a question?

23:29.860 --> 23:33.440
I read the transcript
of purcell's deposition.

23:33.450 --> 23:35.050
Patty destroyed him.

23:35.060 --> 23:37.190
It was like he wasn't even prepared.

23:37.220 --> 23:39.280
Oh,we prepared him.

23:39.290 --> 23:42.180
So,what happened?

23:46.570 --> 23:50.320
look,you brought the fbi to me.

23:50.340 --> 23:53.550
You got me into this.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.870
{\a6}<i>10 years ago</i>

23:55.840 --> 24:01.540
Mr. Purcell,who wrote that letter
to your daughter's day care provider?

24:04.790 --> 24:06.020
I did.

24:06.060 --> 24:10.120
Why did you tell them they needed
to relocate to another facility?

24:10.330 --> 24:13.700
They tested the land.

24:13.950 --> 24:16.870
The contaminant was present.

24:16.890 --> 24:22.050
Mr. Purcell,at what concentration level did
you fear for the safety of your daughter?

24:26.670 --> 24:28.120
30 parts per million.

24:28.140 --> 24:34.850
Why then did ibc global's report claim that
100 parts per million was perfectly acceptable?

24:36.120 --> 24:39.510
Who was right,mr.
Purcell,your company or you?

24:39.540 --> 24:40.400
We're both right.

24:40.410 --> 24:42.470
Then,30 parts per million is toxic?

24:42.490 --> 24:44.910
- That's not what i said.
- Yes or no,mr. Purcell.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.390
- Is 30 parts per million toxic?
- You're not listening.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.240
Or were you wrong when
you wrote that letter?

24:49.260 --> 24:50.400
No,I was right.

24:50.410 --> 24:52.340
So ibc global was lying?

24:52.360 --> 24:55.390
May we take a recess,please?

24:55.790 --> 25:00.280
Ibc was patty's first case
after she started her own firm.

25:00.710 --> 25:02.780
The stakes were very high.

25:02.790 --> 25:05.380
Losing was not an option for her.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.530
Is it ever?

25:06.550 --> 25:12.660
Daniel purcell is a brilliant man,but
when he faced patty,he collapsed.

25:13.370 --> 25:16.310
You know,it never made sense to me.

25:16.330 --> 25:19.760
Do you think patty and purcell colluded?

25:19.770 --> 25:22.950
Well,something went on between them.

25:23.500 --> 25:26.030
How did she get him
to tank his testimony?

25:26.300 --> 25:28.260
Money.

25:28.270 --> 25:30.840
Patty paid purcell?

25:31.560 --> 25:36.160
If I could prove that,i would
have done it a long time ago.

25:45.240 --> 25:48.720
You've reached special agent randall
harrison. Please leave a message.

25:50.130 --> 25:52.140
I went to see hollis nye.

25:52.160 --> 25:55.170
He thinks patty paid off purcell.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.330
We have to pursue this now.

25:57.340 --> 25:59.530
This is bullshit. I've left
you five messages today.

25:59.540 --> 26:02.840
Either you guys meet up
with me or we're done.

26:04.680 --> 26:07.050
Who's daniel purcell?

26:07.760 --> 26:10.540
There's,uh,some extra
cheese if you want.

26:10.550 --> 26:12.370
- Oh,I'm good.
- Thank you.

26:12.380 --> 26:15.820
He's a scientist at a consulting firm.

26:15.830 --> 26:18.370
I used him as an expert witness once.

26:18.460 --> 26:21.440
Well,if I were you,I'd
stay away from the guy.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.130
Why is that?

26:23.140 --> 26:25.090
He totally killed her.

26:25.460 --> 26:27.190
- Michael!
- What?

26:27.200 --> 26:29.820
You should have seen the look
in his eye when he shook my hand.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.720
The guy's a creep.

26:31.730 --> 26:34.190
This is fantastic.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.370
It's the fennel seed and the nutmeg.

26:36.390 --> 26:39.890
No,it's just superb. You're really
learning how to balance your flavors.

26:52.370 --> 26:54.260
You've reached daniel
purcell's cell phone.

26:54.270 --> 26:58.010
Leave a message,and I will return
your call as soon as i am able.

26:59.490 --> 27:01.390
This is josh reston again.

27:01.430 --> 27:03.330
I need you to call me back.

27:03.350 --> 27:05.680
Things are getting worse down here.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.970
We need to talk.

27:27.190 --> 27:29.530
How'd I do on the polygraph?

27:29.550 --> 27:32.190
The results were inconclusive.

27:34.030 --> 27:36.730
you find that funny?

27:36.750 --> 27:39.830
Right about now,yes,I do.

27:40.300 --> 27:43.170
So,I guess we're back where we started.

27:46.730 --> 27:48.350
"We"?

27:48.380 --> 27:51.280
Daniel,I'm trying to defend you.

27:51.290 --> 27:52.760
I'm trying to help.

27:52.770 --> 27:57.990
No,for you,this is just another big...

27:59.280 --> 28:02.560
conspiracy to uncover. To
me,this excruciatingly real.

28:02.570 --> 28:05.700
My daughter lost her
mother. I lost my wife...

28:07.280 --> 28:13.310
who,despite our
problems,i loved... deeply.

28:14.430 --> 28:17.680
I'm aware of that.

28:20.250 --> 28:23.420
But you were right,you know.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.310
You've were right all along.

28:27.750 --> 28:30.330
About what?

28:35.270 --> 28:38.370
I was lying to you.

28:39.570 --> 28:43.140
I had nothing to do with
christine's murder...

28:44.010 --> 28:47.800
but I know a lot more
than I've been saying.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.110
I just want the truth.

28:49.130 --> 28:50.620
I know you do.

28:50.630 --> 28:53.210
But as long as you think
there's a bigger case out there,

28:53.240 --> 28:56.690
you'll fight to protect me and erica.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.280
Not because you care about us,

28:59.300 --> 29:03.470
'cause you want to protect your case.

29:04.710 --> 29:08.330
I understand everything about you,patty.

29:09.260 --> 29:12.270
You don't give a shit about me.

29:12.310 --> 29:18.070
As soon as I give you information on
ultima national,you'll toss me aside.

29:21.790 --> 29:24.590
You really believe that?

29:24.600 --> 29:26.900
Absolutely.

29:28.270 --> 29:31.220
Okay.

29:32.800 --> 29:37.390
I'll call good defense
attorney for you. We're done.

29:47.330 --> 29:49.030
Michael?

29:49.040 --> 29:51.240
What's up?

29:51.250 --> 29:54.640
Just,uh,doing some
work. What's up with you?

29:55.050 --> 29:57.340
Just applying to colleges.

29:57.350 --> 30:01.320
I thought maybe you could
read my application essay.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.670
Sure.

30:04.680 --> 30:08.730
Tell me if it sucks. Be brutal
with me. I can handle it.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.080
All right.

30:33.640 --> 30:36.030
I thought we weren't
going to see each other.

30:36.670 --> 30:39.960
I know. It's stupid.

30:39.970 --> 30:45.360
I shouldn't be here,but
I spoke to wayne suttry.

30:46.630 --> 30:50.220
Whatever he's telling
you,you can't trust him.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.270
Stay out of this,claire.

30:52.290 --> 30:55.420
You shouldn't have sent those
documents to patty hewes.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.540
Your own people are turning against you.

31:00.190 --> 31:06.410
I don't know who killed your wife,but
you are gonna get blamed for it.

31:06.700 --> 31:09.720
- I can handle myself.
- No,danny,you can'T.

31:09.730 --> 31:13.180
You are not safe anymore.

31:16.730 --> 31:20.440
- You've got to leave.
- What do you mean?

31:20.450 --> 31:24.620
You know what I mean. Take erica and go.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.480
Leave the country.

31:34.260 --> 31:37.840
I don't understand why we're
defending daniel purcell.

31:43.390 --> 31:47.880
If you have questions,ellen,all
you need to do is ask.

31:49.420 --> 31:52.170
Well,how did you two meet?

31:52.210 --> 31:57.280
Long before ibc global,I needed an
expert witness in an asbestos case.

31:57.310 --> 31:59.480
I was referred to daniel.

31:59.510 --> 32:02.340
And that was 17 years ago?

32:02.350 --> 32:04.780
Roughly.

32:04.790 --> 32:07.240
And then...

32:07.250 --> 32:10.930
Well,there are some
men you meet who just...

32:11.830 --> 32:15.160
call it... I don't know.

32:16.040 --> 32:21.910
They may be exactly the wrong thing
for you,but things start to happen,

32:21.960 --> 32:24.880
and you can't help yourself.

32:25.990 --> 32:29.360
That's what it was
like for daniel and me.

32:30.280 --> 32:34.460
Until you had the the fallout
during the ibc global case?

32:34.500 --> 32:37.220
He was a witness for the defense.

32:37.230 --> 32:40.400
In order to win,I had to
tear him up in the deposition.

32:40.410 --> 32:41.810
I read the transcripts.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.810
It didn't seem like he
put up much of a fight.

32:46.930 --> 32:48.530
What are you implying?

32:48.540 --> 32:51.510
That I paid him to throw the case?

33:00.890 --> 33:03.280
- What's this?
- Take it.

33:05.330 --> 33:08.880
{\a6}<i>10 years ago</i>

33:05.330 --> 33:08.880
Your day care letter
sunk their entire case.

33:10.160 --> 33:14.150
I threw the deposition because it was the
right thing to do. You don't owe me anything.

33:14.160 --> 33:18.340
I have given this serious
thought,and I want you to have it.

33:23.150 --> 33:25.370
So,what's your big discovery?

33:25.380 --> 33:30.230
Did you find evidence that patty bribed
purcell for his ibc global deposition?

33:30.270 --> 33:35.490
No,but I think there's a deeper reason
she's so obsessed with his wife's murder.

33:35.960 --> 33:37.650
I was focused on the wrong case.

33:37.660 --> 33:40.530
She and purcell worked
together before ibc global.

33:40.540 --> 33:41.270
Yeah?

33:41.280 --> 33:44.860
17 years ago. Well,that's the case
we should have been looking at.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.120
Why is that?

33:46.130 --> 33:48.960
Because michael hewes
is applying for college.

33:48.990 --> 33:50.280
He's about to turn 18.

33:50.290 --> 33:52.360
What does that have to do with anything?

33:52.370 --> 33:54.360
I looked up his birth date.

33:54.370 --> 33:58.710
Roughly nine months after purcell's
testimony concluded,michael was born.

33:59.240 --> 34:02.080
So,you think he's purcell's kid.

34:02.090 --> 34:03.620
It's possible.

34:03.630 --> 34:08.520
Patty's talked a lot about her son,but
she's never once mentioned who his father is.

34:16.739 --> 34:19.900
I guess I should thank you for this.

34:29.239 --> 34:32.199
I always wanted a son.

34:35.340 --> 34:38.270
I just didn't know I actually had one.

34:42.290 --> 34:46.100
Well... now you know.

34:51.150 --> 34:56.900
I have to say that it
struck me as odd,though.

34:58.950 --> 35:01.290
What did?

35:01.300 --> 35:03.950
Your timing.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.520
What do you mean?

35:09.170 --> 35:14.240
Well,you keep this from me for seven
years,and then suddenly decide to come clean?

35:17.690 --> 35:20.430
It was the right thing to do.

35:21.130 --> 35:26.060
No. This is my reward for
helping you win your case.

35:26.830 --> 35:28.670
That's not true.

35:28.700 --> 35:32.300
Really? Then why now?

35:34.050 --> 35:36.910
- It seemed like the right time.
- Bullshit!

35:36.920 --> 35:38.790
Can we talk about this like adults?

35:38.820 --> 35:43.480
You never would have given me these if
I hadn't thrown my testimony your way.

35:43.490 --> 35:46.540
I don't understand. Would
you rather I hadn't told you?

35:46.550 --> 35:49.470
Not like this!

35:58.470 --> 36:01.020
Detective huntley just called.

36:01.030 --> 36:02.580
It was a courtesy call.

36:02.610 --> 36:04.670
What happened?

36:04.680 --> 36:09.490
Daniel purcell was just
arrested boarding a plane at jfk.

36:49.800 --> 36:54.230
The police have been
watching your every move.

36:55.160 --> 36:58.340
What were you thinking?

36:58.350 --> 37:00.860
I just needed to get away for a while.

37:00.870 --> 37:02.870
You tried to leave the country,daniel.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.810
You practically forced
them to arrest you.

37:07.420 --> 37:10.370
Why are you here?

37:10.380 --> 37:13.580
I believe you were set up.

37:13.870 --> 37:18.220
Unr is making record
profits using toxic chemicals

37:18.270 --> 37:23.690
and you're sitting here in a
jumpsuit,paying for their sins.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.680
Then defend me.

37:27.320 --> 37:30.510
Tell me what you know.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.490
Last chance.

37:46.370 --> 37:49.510
Wait,wait,wait,wait. Patty,wait.

37:53.950 --> 37:57.210
Represent me and I'll
tell you everything.

37:58.490 --> 38:01.530
But I need your guarantee.

38:02.990 --> 38:06.110
I want a retainer.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.630
Sign it.

38:50.870 --> 38:56.700
There's a reporter
that you need to meet.

39:01.510 --> 39:04.710
In west virginia.

39:09.730 --> 39:12.210
Shit.

39:31.350 --> 39:33.830
Let's get this to mr. Kendrick.

39:36.790 --> 39:39.400
How did the police know
purcell was going to flee?

39:39.420 --> 39:43.940
Malcolm watched him pack his car and leave
with his daughter in the middle of the night.

39:43.950 --> 39:47.400
The cops always
appreciate anonymous tips.

39:48.580 --> 39:50.470
You put him in jail?

39:50.480 --> 39:53.380
I decided to call daniel's bluff.

39:53.410 --> 39:56.820
People have a tendency to
talk when they're behind bars.

39:56.830 --> 39:58.130
You think he's guilty?

39:58.160 --> 40:03.190
I'm not sure,but christine was wearing
that ring the night she was murdered.

40:06.480 --> 40:10.170
You find that ring and
you find my wife's killer.

40:10.660 --> 40:13.740
Something definitely happened to it.
