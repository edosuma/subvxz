He's a guy you can
at least talk to.

12:20.293 --> 12:21.994
And D.S. needs to free up
some emergency funds

12:22.061 --> 12:23.228
for potential ransom.

12:23.296 --> 12:26.165
That's being handled.

12:27.901 --> 12:30.102
So who's on point?

12:30.170 --> 12:32.171
All right, that was
45 minutes ago though.

12:32.238 --> 12:33.439
No, no, that's fine.

12:33.506 --> 12:36.809
No, I know, but we need
to log faster.

12:36.876 --> 12:39.244
Yeah, but, um, yeah
I'm gonna call you back.

12:39.312 --> 12:41.079
Can you hold on a second?

12:41.147 --> 12:42.614
- Joan.
- Lena.

12:42.682 --> 12:43.849
What can I help you with?

12:43.917 --> 12:45.250
I understand
you've been tasked

12:45.318 --> 12:47.286
with the hostage situation
in East Africa.

12:47.353 --> 12:48.887
That's right.
Annie brought it to me.

12:48.955 --> 12:51.523
D.C.I. kept me on it.

12:51.591 --> 12:53.158
Can I talk with you
in your office?

12:53.226 --> 12:56.094
Sure.

13:06.406 --> 13:07.806
Auggie Anderson's
my former op.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.608
I know his training,
his thought process.

13:09.676 --> 13:11.810
And I am just as familiar
with this territory as you are.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.111
I understand that.

13:13.179 --> 13:14.546
But you don't have
a state department cover

13:14.614 --> 13:16.281
for when it comes time
to negotiate.

13:16.349 --> 13:18.817
If you're even thinking
about boxing me out again,

13:18.885 --> 13:20.886
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

13:20.954 --> 13:23.355
No one's
boxing you out, Joan.

13:23.423 --> 13:25.724
Look, you're wound up.
I get it.

13:25.792 --> 13:27.392
You're concerned.
But there is no reason

13:27.460 --> 13:32.030
to come in here and do this.

13:32.098 --> 13:34.032
Pull up a chair, Joan.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.501
I'm gonna
check in with State.

13:35.568 --> 13:39.438
In the mean time, Annie,
read Joan in on where we stand.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.474
[Brakes squeaking]

14:06.281 --> 14:08.248
Everybody out.

14:09.817 --> 14:10.984
Go, go.

14:11.052 --> 14:13.854
[Speaking arabic]

14:16.724 --> 14:19.793
[Speaking arabic]

14:19.861 --> 14:22.729
Come.

14:42.016 --> 14:44.518
[Speaking arabic]

14:44.586 --> 14:46.286
- What are they saying?
- [Shushing]

14:46.354 --> 14:49.189
[Speaking arabic]

14:49.257 --> 14:52.659
Excuse me, this woman
is engaged to this man.

14:52.727 --> 14:54.127
They're gonna be married.

14:54.195 --> 14:55.796
And since he's your
money source,

14:55.863 --> 14:58.065
it would not be wise
to separate them.

14:58.132 --> 15:00.067
Go ask your boss,
she'll know.

15:00.134 --> 15:01.635
Go ahead.

15:01.703 --> 15:04.538
[Speaking arabic]

15:08.676 --> 15:10.611
Did I hear something about
impending nuptials?

15:10.678 --> 15:13.480
That's right,
me and Parker.

15:20.321 --> 15:22.322
What, he was too cheap
to buy you a ring?

15:22.390 --> 15:23.824
We left it back home.

15:23.891 --> 15:27.127
It needed to be resized.

15:27.195 --> 15:28.629
Smart move.

15:28.696 --> 15:30.597
You never know what can happen
to your most prized possessions

15:30.665 --> 15:31.932
in this part of the world.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.500
- What about Debbie?
- She's on her way home,

15:33.568 --> 15:34.668
courtesy of the Peace Corps.

15:34.736 --> 15:36.136
She's fine.

15:36.204 --> 15:38.138
On to business.

15:38.206 --> 15:41.475
Auggie, your family
in Illinois,

15:41.542 --> 15:44.578
and Parker, your family
in Virginia

15:44.646 --> 15:47.147
will not figure
in the negotiations.

15:47.215 --> 15:48.849
What does that mean?

15:48.916 --> 15:51.585
Means Wade's the rich one,
know your facts.

15:51.653 --> 15:56.023
I can put a price on anything,
oil, minerals, people.

15:56.090 --> 15:57.591
My father will pay.
That won't be a problem.

15:57.659 --> 15:58.925
Good. Good to hear.

15:58.993 --> 16:00.260
That's the spirit.

16:00.328 --> 16:01.828
Now speaking of prices.

16:01.896 --> 16:03.597
There's value
in all sorts of things.

16:03.665 --> 16:06.733
One simply has to know
the details.

16:06.801 --> 16:10.504
For instance,
a man

16:10.571 --> 16:14.741
who maintains his physique,

16:14.809 --> 16:18.178
keeps his head
in a fraught situation--

16:18.246 --> 16:22.015
he may have once
worn a uniform.

16:27.955 --> 16:30.791
What have we here?

16:35.063 --> 16:36.563
Shore leave in Okinawa?

16:36.631 --> 16:40.100
Memorialize this brotherhood
and drunken buzz.

16:40.168 --> 16:42.002
God and country
for all to see.

16:42.070 --> 16:46.273
Am I about right?

16:46.340 --> 16:49.376
I have a phone call to make.

16:49.444 --> 16:50.711
Now when this is all over,

16:50.778 --> 16:52.679
you need to tell me
where you're registered.

16:52.747 --> 16:55.682
I'll send a gift.

16:59.921 --> 17:01.054
[Door closes]

17:01.122 --> 17:02.723
[Door locks]

17:02.790 --> 17:04.023
Based on the coordinates
of the cell phone call,

17:04.092 --> 17:06.292
we'll likely be dealing
with one of six clans

17:06.359 --> 17:07.928
who perpetrate
these hostage takings.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.262
Probably the Hawiye clan.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.664
Maybe, or maybe not.

17:10.732 --> 17:12.566
Things change quickly
in Africa.

17:12.633 --> 17:14.201
Lena forgets
we served together

17:14.268 --> 17:15.935
for a year
at the Nairobi station.

17:16.002 --> 17:18.070
And what a year it was.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.973
I'm concerned
about the Moore family.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.174
They have pull.

17:21.242 --> 17:22.742
And they've hired
Topaz Security.

17:22.810 --> 17:24.243
I can reach out.
Covered.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.746
I've spoken with them and
they're standing down.

17:25.813 --> 17:27.146
- What about the other families?
- No need.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.448
Wade's family has the money.

17:28.516 --> 17:29.716
The Moores have
granted me proxy

17:29.784 --> 17:31.251
to handle the negotiation.

17:31.319 --> 17:32.786
Do we have eyes
over Sudan?

17:32.854 --> 17:36.289
Mm, D.G.S.E. says satellite
availability is imminent.

17:36.357 --> 17:37.858
D.G.S.E.?

17:37.925 --> 17:40.927
You're piggybacking on
a French intelligence satellite?

17:40.995 --> 17:43.363
Yeah. If I waited for N.R.O.
to task satellites,

17:43.431 --> 17:45.766
I'd never
get anything done.

17:45.833 --> 17:48.368
Still bending
the rules, I see.

17:48.436 --> 17:53.039
A woman can get great results
by being flexible, Joan.

17:53.107 --> 17:54.975
Negotiator's holding
on the Polycom.

17:55.042 --> 17:56.676
Do we have the coordinates?

17:56.744 --> 17:59.246
Nothing.
They're good.

17:59.313 --> 18:01.214
All right.
Give us a minute.

18:01.282 --> 18:03.884
Okay, so let's run this down.

18:03.951 --> 18:07.320
White woman, young,
unmarried, 1.1 million.

18:07.388 --> 18:10.957
Rich white American male,
age unimportant, 4.5.

18:11.025 --> 18:14.427
30-year-old male from
suburban Illinois, nominal.

18:14.495 --> 18:15.896
She'll run it up to six.

18:15.963 --> 18:17.330
I'll counter at two.

18:17.398 --> 18:19.032
There's something
you're not considering.

18:19.100 --> 18:22.169
Auggie's ex-Special Forces
and he has the tattoo.

18:22.236 --> 18:23.470
Where?

18:23.538 --> 18:24.905
Here, on his back.

18:24.972 --> 18:26.439
Pirates have other options.

18:26.507 --> 18:28.341
There's a standing offer
from Hezbollah

18:28.409 --> 18:29.709
and the Brothers in Allah,

18:29.777 --> 18:32.445
$2 million for any captured
U.S. serviceman.

18:32.513 --> 18:35.415
She's right. Special Forces
get a bonus, 4 million.

18:35.483 --> 18:36.950
That means they could
sell Auggie independently

18:37.018 --> 18:38.285
regardless
of what we offer.

18:38.352 --> 18:39.820
We have to acknowledge
he's Special Forces.

18:39.887 --> 18:41.354
No, actually, we don't.

18:41.422 --> 18:43.523
Well, it would
be better if we did,

18:43.591 --> 18:44.958
as a sign of good faith.

18:45.026 --> 18:49.095
There is no good faith
in negotiations like this.

18:49.163 --> 18:51.364
Lena's right.
We should hold it.

18:51.432 --> 18:53.500
If they don't know,
we shouldn't give 'em idea.

18:53.568 --> 18:56.469
Let's get this done.

19:01.943 --> 19:03.877
This is Lena Smith
from the State Department.

19:03.945 --> 19:05.212
Good to talk with you,
Lena.

19:05.279 --> 19:08.181
Are you still
drinking Tusker?

19:08.249 --> 19:10.750
More than
I probably should, yes.

19:10.818 --> 19:12.586
Can you give me a minute?

19:12.653 --> 19:14.054
I know this woman.

19:14.121 --> 19:17.190
Analise Pound, she's a former
U.S. oil executive.

19:17.258 --> 19:19.693
Spent half her life
in East Africa.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.394
Sometimes she can
get emotional.

19:21.462 --> 19:23.196
Two of her hostages
have died recently.

19:23.264 --> 19:25.398
- So request another negotiator.
- No, I can handle it.

19:25.466 --> 19:28.001
So we're thinking two.

19:28.069 --> 19:30.837
2 million
for all three hostages.

19:34.609 --> 19:36.710
Analise, I'm not gonna
negotiate with myself.

19:36.777 --> 19:38.945
Well, you're not
negotiating with me.

19:39.013 --> 19:40.413
I'm not?

19:40.481 --> 19:42.515
You're a far cry
from eight.

19:42.583 --> 19:45.352
Eight? For a spoiled rich kid
and his two friends?

19:45.419 --> 19:47.854
Whose families still
value them, no doubt.

19:47.922 --> 19:49.422
Plus one is Special Forces.

19:49.490 --> 19:51.057
You understand what
the means, don't you?

19:51.125 --> 19:53.994
Special Forces, it's the first
I've heard of that.

19:54.061 --> 19:55.562
Ahha.

19:55.630 --> 19:57.197
It says here on my dossier
that one of the men is blind.

19:57.265 --> 19:58.999
Is that true?

19:59.066 --> 20:01.201
Doesn't make him any
less valuable to certain parties

20:01.269 --> 20:04.204
who have an abiding interest
in U.S. soldiers.

20:04.272 --> 20:08.508
What would the State Department
say to his family then, Lena?

20:08.576 --> 20:09.910
Is that a threat?

20:09.977 --> 20:11.511
You know how I feel
about threats.

20:11.579 --> 20:13.346
Call it a question
with a pinch of malice.

20:13.414 --> 20:15.415
I'm prepared to offer
a package deal.

20:15.483 --> 20:17.517
But because you weren't
upfront with me,

20:17.585 --> 20:21.354
wasted my time,
it's 10 million.

20:21.422 --> 20:23.256
We're standing at 2.

20:23.324 --> 20:24.491
Take that to your people.

20:24.558 --> 20:27.160
We'll be waiting.

20:27.228 --> 20:29.963
It's a little like
buying a car.

20:34.602 --> 20:37.437
[Door opens]

20:40.741 --> 20:42.409
You, come.

20:42.476 --> 20:43.877
Who is he talking to?

20:43.945 --> 20:45.078
He wants me
to go with him.

20:45.146 --> 20:46.413
[Gasps]
Wait, wait.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.048
Where are you taking her?
Don't touch me.

20:48.115 --> 20:50.116
You never touch me.
Hey, Wade.

20:50.184 --> 20:52.218
No, no, no, Wade.
Auggie, Auggie.

20:52.286 --> 20:53.286
Wade!
No, no, no.

20:53.354 --> 20:54.654
[Grunting]

20:54.722 --> 20:55.989
Wade.

20:56.057 --> 20:59.159
Wade, no, no, no.
It's fine.

20:59.226 --> 21:03.730
[Speaking arabic]

21:03.798 --> 21:07.600
Wade, he just wants
to take her to the bathroom.

21:07.668 --> 21:09.669
Okay.

21:09.737 --> 21:11.805
[Speaking arabic]

21:18.579 --> 21:20.647
All right, Wade, he's gonna
take you first now.

21:20.715 --> 21:23.850
You, go.

21:23.918 --> 21:26.786
[Yells]

21:29.991 --> 21:31.057
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

21:31.125 --> 21:32.325
That was good. That was good.

21:32.393 --> 21:33.693
He stood up for you.
He risked his life.

21:33.761 --> 21:35.295
They might just buy
that you two are engaged.

21:35.363 --> 21:38.031
Now listen to me, I need you
to stay close to him.

21:38.099 --> 21:39.299
I need you
to help me sell it, okay?

21:39.367 --> 21:40.467
Okay.

21:40.534 --> 21:43.636
He--you--

21:43.704 --> 21:46.973
you seem to know exactly
what to say and do,

21:47.041 --> 21:48.341
and just be so calm.

21:48.409 --> 21:52.112
Like, how--how do--
how do you know all this?

21:52.179 --> 21:54.948
How? I don't--
Hey, hey.

22:01.655 --> 22:05.425
I gotta tell you something
before Wade gets back.

22:08.929 --> 22:11.798
[Sighs]

22:14.568 --> 22:18.738
I'm with the CIA.

22:18.806 --> 22:21.207
I understand
situations like this,

22:21.275 --> 22:24.310
people like this.

22:24.378 --> 22:27.047
I can keep you safe.

22:27.114 --> 22:31.117
Like CIA, CIA?

22:31.185 --> 22:32.519
Yeah.

22:32.586 --> 22:33.420
Is that why
we're in this place?

22:33.487 --> 22:34.921
No, no.

22:34.989 --> 22:36.156
But my training is what's
gonna get us out of here.

22:36.223 --> 22:37.690
Wait, wait.

22:37.758 --> 22:41.428
When--

22:41.495 --> 22:45.331
when were you gonna tell me?

22:47.334 --> 22:51.237
I was gonna tell you
the next time you were in D.C.

22:51.305 --> 22:54.407
Parker, I thought a lot
about how to tell you.

22:54.475 --> 22:57.043
And believe me,
it wasn't like this.

22:57.111 --> 22:59.479
I was gonna take three days
off of work

22:59.547 --> 23:01.381
just so that we could
have time to talk about it.

23:01.449 --> 23:02.749
I knew you'd have questions.

23:02.817 --> 23:05.285
Look, I-I know this is hard.

23:05.352 --> 23:08.955
Hard?

23:09.023 --> 23:11.057
Oh, that doesn't begin
to describe this.

23:11.125 --> 23:13.860
Parker--
ah, come on.

23:16.397 --> 23:18.998
You proposed to me.

23:19.066 --> 23:21.301
I said yes.

23:21.368 --> 23:23.203
Who am I marrying, Auggie?
No, no, no.

23:23.270 --> 23:25.438
You know who I am, Parker.
Don't do that.

23:25.506 --> 23:29.142
Listen to me,
I love you.

23:29.210 --> 23:33.146
I trust you completely.

23:33.214 --> 23:35.315
Now I-I've compromised
your trust.

23:35.382 --> 23:38.151
I'm sorry.

23:40.354 --> 23:43.189
I'm sorry too.

24:06.358 --> 24:08.826
[Door opens]

24:08.894 --> 24:11.729
You, come.

24:16.568 --> 24:19.203
[Door closes]

24:19.271 --> 24:21.739
That was--[sniffs]

24:21.807 --> 24:23.474
Smart what you did earlier,

24:23.542 --> 24:25.543
saying that
she was my fiancee.

24:25.610 --> 24:27.111
I wouldn't have
been that quick.

24:27.179 --> 24:29.246
You did fine.

24:29.314 --> 24:30.481
I don't know.
I'm not really known

24:30.549 --> 24:31.749
for my quick wit.

24:31.817 --> 24:33.584
Seven different boarding schools
in seven years.

24:33.652 --> 24:35.953
My father was convinced
I wouldn't amount to anything.

24:36.021 --> 24:39.190
And I have been trying
to prove him right ever since.

24:39.257 --> 24:41.058
You dedicated your life
to public service.

24:41.126 --> 24:44.228
Yeah, I don't really
think of it as service.

24:44.296 --> 24:46.664
The fact is, it's a blast,
the Peace Corps.

24:46.732 --> 24:49.333
The people, the travel.

24:49.401 --> 24:53.571
Parker though,
she's the real deal.

24:53.638 --> 24:55.806
She really cares.

24:55.874 --> 24:58.376
You know, she talks
about you nonstop.

24:58.443 --> 25:01.512
You're a lucky guy.

25:01.580 --> 25:04.415
I know.

25:07.352 --> 25:10.221
Here.

25:13.959 --> 25:16.494
- How did you get this?
- It was on the ground.

25:16.561 --> 25:18.963
Must've fallen out
of his pocket, so I grabbed it.

25:19.031 --> 25:20.331
[Sighs and chuckles]

25:20.399 --> 25:25.870
Wade, you keep this up,

25:25.937 --> 25:28.672
you may find yourself
in the wedding party.

25:41.453 --> 25:43.087
It's too quiet.

25:43.155 --> 25:44.522
You need to reach out,
up the bid.

25:44.589 --> 25:46.390
Nope. Ball's in their court,
and they know it.

25:46.458 --> 25:48.025
Well, then I wanna
speak to Angus Moore.

25:48.093 --> 25:49.393
I'll bring him up to speed.

25:49.461 --> 25:51.028
He might solve all of this
with a single check.

25:51.096 --> 25:52.763
One team, one voice, Joan.

25:52.831 --> 25:54.999
He'll lose confidence
if we confuse him.

25:55.067 --> 25:58.769
Who knows what
his next play will be?

25:58.837 --> 26:00.471
Annie, you have a call
on your N.O.C. line,

26:00.539 --> 26:02.773
the Smithsonian.
Uh, take a message, please.

26:02.841 --> 26:04.108
Oh, no, that's okay.
You can take it.

26:04.176 --> 26:05.776
All we can
do now is wait.

26:05.844 --> 26:08.679
I'll be quick.

26:12.451 --> 26:13.818
Hello.

26:13.885 --> 26:15.719
I was just thinking about
our weekend in Munich

26:15.787 --> 26:19.190
and I thought, "Did you
take my phone charger?"

26:19.257 --> 26:21.058
Uh, really, that's
why you're calling?

26:21.126 --> 26:23.928
What other reason
would I have?

26:23.995 --> 26:26.030
Actually, yes, I did
take your phone charger.

26:26.098 --> 26:27.865
I didn't realize until
I got back home and saw mine.

26:27.933 --> 26:28.966
Well, I need it back.

26:29.034 --> 26:30.234
I need to make a phone call.

26:30.302 --> 26:31.936
Aren't you making
a call right now?

26:32.003 --> 26:34.238
Not for much longer
without my charger.

26:34.306 --> 26:35.773
Tell you what,
why don't you do this?

26:35.841 --> 26:37.475
I'm in Paris.
Fly to Paris,

26:37.542 --> 26:39.643
and you can
bring it back to me.

26:39.711 --> 26:42.113
You want me to buy
a $2,000 plane ticket

26:42.180 --> 26:44.148
to return a $20 charger?

26:44.216 --> 26:46.183
No, the ticket's on me.

26:46.251 --> 26:49.086
- Buy a new one, Simon.
- Come on, Annie.

26:49.154 --> 26:51.222
Where's your sense
of adventure?

26:51.289 --> 26:52.790
I'll talk to you later.

26:52.858 --> 26:55.593
I gotta go.
Bye.

27:02.234 --> 27:03.801
- Was that--?
- Yeah.

27:03.869 --> 27:06.637
- Nice.

[Distant indistinct chatter]

27:59.157 --> 28:01.992
[Indistinct whispering]

28:09.167 --> 28:11.969
Listen up, moments ago,
there was an armed attempt

28:12.037 --> 28:15.406
to rescue our hostages
and they hit the wrong house.

28:15.473 --> 28:17.208
Moore went ahead and
sent in Topaz anyway.

28:17.275 --> 28:18.442
Yeah.

28:18.510 --> 28:19.510
I thought we had
that under control.

28:19.578 --> 28:20.544
So did I.

28:20.612 --> 28:21.745
Always expect the wild card.

28:21.813 --> 28:23.280
Always build in redundancy.

28:23.348 --> 28:25.182
Incoming,
it's your negotiator.

28:25.250 --> 28:28.552
Wonderful.

28:28.620 --> 28:29.720
[Phone beeps]

28:29.788 --> 28:31.655
Big, big mistake.

28:31.723 --> 28:32.823
We can't
be held responsible.

28:32.891 --> 28:34.024
We had no hand in this.

28:34.092 --> 28:35.292
Your T.A.C. team is dead.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.428
- They're not ours.
- New rules.

28:37.495 --> 28:40.331
Price is now 15 million,
no more negotiation.

28:40.398 --> 28:41.865
You have two hours.

28:41.933 --> 28:43.734
Because of your screw up,
you lose a hostage.

28:43.802 --> 28:46.537
Click.

28:46.605 --> 28:48.405
[Phone beeps]

28:48.473 --> 28:50.107
Angus Moore
was always a cowboy.

28:50.175 --> 28:52.376
And Topaz never
cared much for protocol.

28:52.444 --> 28:54.078
Well, you said you had them
standing down.

28:54.145 --> 28:55.679
They're private actors.

28:55.747 --> 28:57.081
There's no controlling that.

28:57.148 --> 28:58.716
The good news is, they were
incompetent enough

28:58.783 --> 29:00.251
not to get anybody hurt.

29:00.318 --> 29:01.852
Nothing's changed.

29:01.920 --> 29:04.121
Still making promises
you can't keep.

29:04.189 --> 29:07.157
Still taking unnecessary risks
with my operatives.

29:07.225 --> 29:08.659
What are we talking about?

29:08.727 --> 29:10.194
Nairobi, right?

29:10.262 --> 29:11.862
All over again.

29:11.930 --> 29:14.465
Whatever you think
happened back then, didn't.

29:14.532 --> 29:16.467
You're like
a heartsick schoolgirl

29:16.534 --> 29:17.601
who just can't let go.

29:17.669 --> 29:19.036
You blew my asset.

29:19.104 --> 29:20.804
Someone died.
You left town.

29:20.872 --> 29:24.708
What part of that
is incorrect?

29:24.776 --> 29:26.744
Jonathan,
for your information,

29:26.811 --> 29:29.880
was not who you thought he was,
professionally or otherwise.

29:29.948 --> 29:31.649
He got himself killed.

29:31.716 --> 29:33.150
Okay, stop.

29:33.218 --> 29:34.485
We need a contingency plan.

29:34.552 --> 29:37.388
This is about Auggie.

29:39.391 --> 29:42.760
She's right.

29:42.827 --> 29:44.662
Let's keep our heads,

29:44.729 --> 29:48.465
and get your friend back,
like I promised.

29:53.004 --> 29:55.272
- You, come, everyone.
- Where are we going?

[Engine starts]

30:29.741 --> 30:32.576
Why are they moving us?

30:34.946 --> 30:37.281
It means we need
to escape.

30:46.119 --> 30:47.420
[Horn honking]

30:47.487 --> 30:48.688
Sounds like we're
hitting more traffic.

30:48.755 --> 30:50.222
They must be taking us
back into the city.

30:50.290 --> 30:51.724
Maybe the deal's been made.

30:51.792 --> 30:53.326
You heard that explosion.
That was a rescue attempt.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.427
Maybe there will
be another one.

30:54.494 --> 30:56.495
Hostages don't
survive moves.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.964
We need to escape.

30:58.031 --> 30:59.265
Now if we're heading
back into the city,

30:59.333 --> 31:00.566
that means roadblocks.

31:00.634 --> 31:01.901
That's gonna
be our best shot.

31:01.969 --> 31:04.470
No, no.

31:04.538 --> 31:06.872
Parker, I know you don't
wanna hear this right now.

31:06.940 --> 31:08.474
But you need to trust me.
No.

31:08.542 --> 31:10.776
I'm frozen, Auggie, okay?

31:10.844 --> 31:12.211
That's how terrifying
this is.

31:12.279 --> 31:15.214
I just--
hey, you can do this.

31:15.282 --> 31:16.916
I need you.

31:16.984 --> 31:20.486
Now we are gonna
get out of this together.

31:20.554 --> 31:22.455
Okay?

31:22.522 --> 31:24.357
Okay.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.892
Okay.
[Sniffling]

31:26.960 --> 31:28.627
We have firepower
in the area, right?

31:28.695 --> 31:30.363
It's not that easy, Annie.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.498
<i>U.S.S. Carl Vinson</i>
is in the Red Sea.

31:32.566 --> 31:34.433
And Seal Team Two
is on that ship.

31:34.501 --> 31:37.870
We have them on alert.
And move them where?

31:37.938 --> 31:39.805
Pound is gonna move them.

31:39.873 --> 31:41.040
She thinks we have
a possible fix,

31:41.108 --> 31:42.241
so she'll move 'em
into a city.

31:42.309 --> 31:44.377
Ras Hadarba.
It's something.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.778
I'm all for action.

31:45.846 --> 31:47.813
But an entire city?
That's not actionable.

31:47.881 --> 31:49.782
We wire the money.
And we wait.

31:49.850 --> 31:52.018
Now you agree?
Now?

31:52.085 --> 31:53.753
If anything goes wrong,

31:53.820 --> 31:55.254
the extraction team
is on standby.

31:55.322 --> 31:56.722
We just have
to give them the word.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.791
Why are you waiting
till something goes wrong?

31:58.859 --> 32:00.760
Annie, we don't know
where Auggie is.

32:00.827 --> 32:02.895
And we can't put more people
at risk until we do.

32:02.963 --> 32:05.598
When we get word,
or we hear from Auggie himself,

32:05.665 --> 32:07.500
then maybe we can do something.
Otherwise, we wait.

32:07.567 --> 32:09.335
Auggie will
follow his training.

32:09.403 --> 32:11.270
He will find a way
to escape if he needs to.

32:11.338 --> 32:14.173
I know him.

32:16.176 --> 32:17.676
It's your call, Annie.

32:17.744 --> 32:21.480
You know him well.

32:21.548 --> 32:25.484
No one knows him better.

33:13.233 --> 33:16.035
All right, this is it.
Get ready.

33:16.103 --> 33:17.336
Now listen to me,

we go.

34:20.065 --> 34:22.001
Auggie, I knew it.

34:22.068 --> 34:23.335
Are you okay?
Yeah, we're all right.

34:23.402 --> 34:24.803
But we need a ride.

34:24.871 --> 34:26.237
They're en route,
20 minutes.

We'll use this

It's so good to hear your voice.
You have no idea.

34:30.710 --> 34:33.478
Actually,
I'm pretty sure I do.

34:35.748 --> 34:38.583
We need to find a rooftop.

- Go.

as you need to, go.

No, it's too high.

No, we can't.
There's no way.

35:00.173 --> 35:01.207
We gotta find
our way to the roof.

- Stop, stop, stop.
- Fence.

35:22.195 --> 35:23.762
We can go through.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.664
Okay, go, go, go.

35:25.732 --> 35:28.667
- Don't bust your head.
- Yeah.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.135
Auggie said he'd be on
the roof of the building

35:30.203 --> 35:32.938
for extraction.

35:33.006 --> 35:34.340
What's that on the roof?

35:34.407 --> 35:36.542
Auggie, there are towers.

35:36.610 --> 35:38.477
- How high?
- High.

35:38.545 --> 35:40.613
Then they can't
land on the building.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.014
What's the E.T.A.
for the chopper?

- Two minutes.
- Two minutes.

think about it, Auggie.

- Auggie, no.

35:56.496 --> 35:58.364
- Wade?
- Yeah.

35:58.431 --> 35:59.999
Then we jump.
You go first.

jump together.

36:03.003 --> 36:04.136
Auggie, no.

We barely made it
up the stairs.

We can do this.

Guys, they're coming.

36:10.944 --> 36:13.812
Then we jump.

36:26.050 --> 36:29.886
[Grunts]

36:29.954 --> 36:31.588
- You okay?
- Yeah.

36:31.656 --> 36:32.990
- Okay, he's okay.
- Okay.

36:33.057 --> 36:34.958
We're gonna count off
our steps together, ready?

36:35.026 --> 36:38.795
Both: One, two, three, four.

36:42.266 --> 36:45.102
Now here's the deal,
we both have to commit.

36:45.169 --> 36:48.505
Once we start running,
we cannot stop, okay?

36:48.573 --> 36:53.677
- Okay.
- Okay, take my hand.

36:53.745 --> 36:56.680
Parker, we can do this.
Take my hand.

37:03.955 --> 37:07.190
Now.

37:07.258 --> 37:09.092
[Grunts]

37:14.232 --> 37:16.166
[Exhales]

37:16.234 --> 37:17.367
[Grunts]

37:17.435 --> 37:22.272
[Gunshots]

37:23.875 --> 37:26.543
[Panting]

37:26.611 --> 37:28.945
They're coming.

37:29.013 --> 37:31.982
[Helicopter approaching]

37:33.751 --> 37:36.453
[Gunshots]

37:50.902 --> 37:53.704
[Exhales]

37:58.876 --> 38:01.611
Good work,
Annie Walker.

38:06.317 --> 38:09.186
Joan, thank you for--

38:25.536 --> 38:26.870
Cheers.

38:26.938 --> 38:29.773
Cheers.

38:31.909 --> 38:33.210
I know this wasn't what
you thought

38:33.277 --> 38:34.344
you were going
to be doing today.

38:34.412 --> 38:35.846
Work is work.

38:35.913 --> 38:40.016
We're gonna accomplish
a lot together, you and me.

38:40.084 --> 38:41.184
Think Joan's okay?

38:41.252 --> 38:44.421
Eh, she's a big girl.
She gets it.

38:44.489 --> 38:49.259
Annie, you wanna climb up
the ladder at the Agency, right?

38:49.327 --> 38:52.829
To do that, you need
a storied biography.

38:52.897 --> 38:54.865
Joan is one chapter
in that story.

38:54.932 --> 38:56.199
I will be another.

38:56.267 --> 38:58.301
And someone else
after me will be your next.

38:58.369 --> 39:00.771
Then one day,
it will be you.

39:00.838 --> 39:05.709
You will be that story.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.844
So Simon's calling you
on your N.O.C. line?

39:07.912 --> 39:09.646
Not bad.

39:09.714 --> 39:11.014
I didn't even
give him the number.

39:11.082 --> 39:13.416
He must have got it off
my N.O.C. profile online.

39:13.484 --> 39:15.152
[Chuckles]
Even better.

39:15.219 --> 39:17.154
I took his
cell phone charger.

39:17.221 --> 39:22.392
I'm having S&T wire it up,
GPS tracker, data mining.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.828
Then I'll return it
to him in Paris.

39:24.896 --> 39:27.497
Adding to your story
already.

39:27.565 --> 39:29.399
[Laughs]

39:45.116 --> 39:47.651
I didn't kneel.

39:47.718 --> 39:50.554
Maybe that was the problem.

39:53.357 --> 39:54.391
How did you--?

39:54.458 --> 39:59.196
Parker, will you marry me?

39:59.263 --> 40:00.463
Auggie--

40:00.531 --> 40:02.732
I should have trusted you.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.635
Forgive me.

40:11.342 --> 40:12.542
Yes.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.444
Yeah.

40:20.084 --> 40:23.720
I told you my only secret,
I promise.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.830
Okay.

40:33.898 --> 40:38.335
We're gonna be happy.

40:38.402 --> 40:41.238
I know.

40:58.489 --> 41:00.690
Okay, I've cleared
my whole night.

41:00.758 --> 41:03.827
And I have a care package,
wine, chocolate, ice cream.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.562
I'm good.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.397
You're already
into the wine?

41:07.465 --> 41:11.568
Michael and I decided
to give it another shot.

41:11.636 --> 41:12.936
I know, I know.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.838
Um, what happened?

41:14.906 --> 41:16.306
Michael was just
pleading with me

41:16.374 --> 41:17.807
in that sad little
hotel room.

41:17.875 --> 41:19.609
And I just looked at him
and thought

41:19.677 --> 41:20.977
of all the moments
we'd had together.

41:21.045 --> 41:23.713
And I just realized that--

41:23.781 --> 41:25.882
that chapter of my life
is not over yet.

41:25.950 --> 41:27.484
Because I don't
want it to be.

41:27.551 --> 41:29.419
Danielle, is this
about the girls?

41:29.487 --> 41:31.688
I'm doing it for us,
as a family.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.189
Girls need a happy mom.

41:33.257 --> 41:34.491
Yeah, and I'll get there.

41:34.558 --> 41:37.827
We'll get there,
as a family--

41:37.895 --> 41:39.529
in California.

41:39.597 --> 41:41.398
In California?

41:41.465 --> 41:43.300
Michael got a job
in the Bay area.

41:43.367 --> 41:44.968
The hours are better,
so he'll be home

41:45.036 --> 41:48.371
so we can work on things.

41:48.439 --> 41:49.906
That's amazing.

41:49.974 --> 41:51.141
You think so?

41:51.208 --> 41:53.576
I do. I do.

41:53.644 --> 41:55.211
I mean, and you won't
be homeless.

41:55.279 --> 41:57.280
The market sucks, so we'll
figure out the house--

41:57.348 --> 42:01.117
Oh, my gosh, I'm not
thinking about that.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.689
I'm gonna miss you
very much.
