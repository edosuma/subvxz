WEBVTT

00:05.672 --> 00:08.507
(scat singing)

00:12.178 --> 00:15.214
Help!
Do you consent to having
your feet washed?!

00:15.216 --> 00:19.018
Hell no! My feet are fine!
Come on. Pops want me
to wash them nasty feet!

00:19.020 --> 00:21.920
Help! Help! Help!

00:54.687 --> 00:58.757
Lloyd (moaning):
Ooh! Ooh! Oh! Ah.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.560
Oh. Ah.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.796
(moaning continues)

01:05.665 --> 01:08.167
Ah.
There you go, lloyd.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.335
Now tell me that wasn't
30 minutes of pure heaven.

01:10.337 --> 01:14.106
How dare you violate an innocent
old man's feet like that!

01:14.108 --> 01:15.674
Towel!

01:15.676 --> 01:17.676
Damn, lloyd, you done made

01:17.678 --> 01:19.178
A bucket of chitlin water
over there.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.013
Get that rope off me!

01:21.015 --> 01:23.015
Look, man, you got a problem
with it, holla at pops, man.

01:23.017 --> 01:24.850
I ain't feel like
doing this shit, no way, man,

01:24.852 --> 01:27.586
But he guided me in my dream and
told me I had to wash your feet.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.887
Well, what if
I want my feet dirty?

01:28.889 --> 01:31.190
Look, this ain't
about you, lloyd.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.758
Pops say I'm too big
for my britches, man.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.226
He had to remind me
that I'm not above

01:34.228 --> 01:37.196
Washing some nasty
mother(bleep) feet like yours.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.365
You and god need to leave me out
of your sick little foot fetish!

01:40.367 --> 01:42.634
And don't expect a tip.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.269
(sighing, coughing)

01:44.271 --> 01:47.639
(ms. Tudi moaning)

01:47.641 --> 01:49.808
(moaning)

01:49.810 --> 01:51.210
Ooh!

01:51.212 --> 01:52.878
Mm, that feels so good.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.314
Better than the last few times
I got some.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.982
(laughs)
ew, ma!

01:56.984 --> 01:58.884
Ms. Tudi:
Ew, nothing, boonie! Grow up!

01:58.886 --> 02:00.886
You know, ms. Tudi,
it's always been

02:00.888 --> 02:02.554
Kind of like a gift
for me, washing feet.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.922
You know what I'm saying?

02:03.924 --> 02:05.757
But you can count on pops
to bless me

02:05.759 --> 02:07.960
With a old wild-ass talent
like foot washing.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.129
You saying you can't make
no money doing this?

02:10.131 --> 02:11.930
I mean, it ain't that.
It's just, every time I do it,

02:11.932 --> 02:13.732
I do it 'cause he make me do it.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.501
You know, he ain't never told me
I could charge people for it.

02:15.503 --> 02:18.837
Did he tell you you
couldn't charge for it? Huh?

02:18.839 --> 02:21.406
Look, look, it's like
when you was a carpenter.

02:21.408 --> 02:22.774
Remember that?

02:22.776 --> 02:24.843
God asked you to go legit.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.812
God gave you a skill.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.480
What's the problem?

02:28.482 --> 02:31.083
So what would I do? Would I,
like, set up on a street corner

02:31.085 --> 02:32.918
Or get me a little booth
at the swap meet or something?

02:32.920 --> 02:34.253
You said god told you

02:34.255 --> 02:35.821
To buy that stupid-ass
food truck, right?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.589
Yeah.
Maybe this is why.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.592
A mobile spa van.
(laughs)

02:40.594 --> 02:43.162
We can call it, uh,
"angelic hands."

02:43.164 --> 02:44.463
(phone camera clicks)

02:44.465 --> 02:46.431
Listen here,
we'll go downtown,

02:46.433 --> 02:47.933
And we'll set up outside

02:47.935 --> 02:49.368
The yoga spot, right?

02:49.370 --> 02:50.669
I know I can get

02:50.671 --> 02:53.672
Two dozen bitches, a dub each.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.041
50/50. How that sound?

02:56.043 --> 02:58.043
I don't know, ms. Tudi.
You be with that bullshit.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.478
You'll mess around
and have a brother crossed up.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.180
No pun intended,
'cause I been crossed up before,

03:01.182 --> 03:02.714
And the shit don't feel good.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.883
Okay, guilty, but look.

03:04.885 --> 03:08.387
You know I've been trying
to walk that path.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.189
A better path and in your light.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.891
If we can make some money
rubbing bitches' feet,

03:12.893 --> 03:14.893
Can't get no more
legit than that.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.895
We could be doing a lot worse.
I'm just saying.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.031
See what I'm saying?

03:19.033 --> 03:21.733
I hear you.
Sound good. I'm wit' it.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.302
Stop that shit!

03:23.304 --> 03:24.736
You like that?

03:24.738 --> 03:27.172
I'm getting excited!
Look here.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.474
I'm gonna make
a sweet logo on the side.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.476
It's gonna say "angelic hands."

03:31.478 --> 03:33.312
(laughs)
I'm seeing your vision,
ms. Tudi.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.247
I'm seeing it right now.
It's looking fly.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.816
I'm getting butterflies,
and, yeah, it's dope, it's...

03:37.818 --> 03:39.985
And listen, I'm gonna take care
of everything.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.221
(laughs)

03:42.223 --> 03:43.989
And look here.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.724
You.
Oh, ms. Tudi,

03:45.726 --> 03:48.060
That ain't even necessary.
You ain't got to do that.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.928
But I'll take it though.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.431
(laughs)
how he get
to smoke in the house?

03:52.433 --> 03:54.900
'cause he jesus!

03:56.436 --> 03:57.903
Jesus!

03:57.905 --> 04:00.105
Man, I been looking all over
for you. Why don't you

04:00.107 --> 04:02.207
Hook a brother up with
another one of them massages?

04:02.209 --> 04:04.343
My feet still tingly.
I feel young and spry!

04:04.345 --> 04:05.611
Oh, so now you want one

04:05.613 --> 04:07.579
After you was being all funky
about it earlier.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.782
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look, I'll
bow, I'll hold my head down.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.685
Right here. Look.
Come on, hook me up.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.087
Look at that.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.788
Look, lloyd, if
you really want one

04:16.790 --> 04:18.223
That bad, man, we

04:18.225 --> 04:20.058
In a couple hours
by the yoga spot.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.060
I might be able to hook you up
if I got some time.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.062
Just if I got
time, lloyd.
But, jesus,

04:24.064 --> 04:25.797
I need the hookup right now.
Look on, man.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.132
Come on, brother,

04:27.134 --> 04:29.067
Downtown, lloyd.
Downtown.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.702
Jesus, you never
come through!

04:30.704 --> 04:32.938
Jesus!

04:35.775 --> 04:37.976
♪ ♪

04:39.912 --> 04:41.546
Really, jesus?

04:41.548 --> 04:43.148
Always on time, huh?

04:43.150 --> 04:45.717
Oh, come on, ms. Tudi.
You got to give me a break.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.152
I had to get some weed.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.888
Yeah, I'm about
to get me a sugar mama.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.724
Bunch of older broads
with disposable income

04:52.726 --> 04:56.094
And low expectations
for future prospects.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.297
Boonie, all these hoes can
do better than you, hear?

04:58.299 --> 05:00.399
Boonie: Hey.
Ms. Tudi: Leave 'em alone.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.634
I can look at some
post-prime ass in yoga pants

05:02.636 --> 05:04.403
If I want to, mama.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.405
What you think?
"hands of god," ms. Tudi?

05:06.407 --> 05:08.507
I thought you was going
with "angelic hands."

05:08.509 --> 05:09.508
Them don't even

05:09.510 --> 05:11.109
Look like my hands.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.512
Yeah, but look, the "hands of
god" just has more "mmm!"

05:13.514 --> 05:15.947
Hey, you know god got
more "mmm" for your ass.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.316
You know the
rules, ms. Tudi!

05:17.318 --> 05:18.950
Don't use god's
name in vain!

05:18.952 --> 05:20.919
Ms. Tudi: Jesus,
please, would you just

05:20.921 --> 05:22.454
Stop worrying?!

05:22.456 --> 05:24.122
Tudi, how

05:24.124 --> 05:26.792
Okay, teresa, listen,

(sighs)

05:26.794 --> 05:29.294
We getting ready to get
started, girl, hear?

05:29.296 --> 05:31.196
Hell yeah.
Come on in, get nice and close.

05:31.198 --> 05:34.466
(laughs)
okay, jesus. Ta-da!

05:34.468 --> 05:36.101
(ms. Tudi laughs)

05:36.103 --> 05:40.472
Yeah! All right, my queens, get
ready for the time of your life.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.107
Tudi?
What?

05:42.109 --> 05:44.109
That's the hands of god?
Teresa,

05:44.111 --> 05:46.311
This is a peaceful
environment here.

05:46.313 --> 05:49.247
Namaste.
Namaste.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.985
Uh, ladies, this here is fish.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.787
(women whoop, murmur)
he ain't bad.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.556
And he will be attending

05:57.558 --> 05:59.291
To your needs
while you wait.

05:59.293 --> 06:00.792
Whatever your needs.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.160
What you want me
to do, ms. Tudi?

06:02.162 --> 06:03.528
Nigga, I don't know.
Just what?

06:03.530 --> 06:05.731
Rub their shoulders,
you know, make 'em happy.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.466
(sniffles)
and lose this.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.301
Take off the jacket,
nigga!
Woman: Yeah!

06:09.303 --> 06:11.570
Woman 2: Mmm! No, no, no!
It's too hot for that jacket.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.138
Take... Yes, take it off!

06:13.140 --> 06:15.874
And mama's got a lot of needs.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.976
(laughter, whooping)

06:17.978 --> 06:20.746
(teresa moaning)
how long he gonna be in
there with that bitch?

06:20.748 --> 06:21.980
Shit.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.515

06:23.517 --> 06:26.485
Coming in!

06:26.487 --> 06:28.487
(sighs)

06:28.489 --> 06:31.490
(moaning)

06:31.492 --> 06:33.492
Ms. Tudi:
Hey, teresa.

Go ahead and enjoy.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.163
Thanks.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.831
Would you wrap
this ho up?

06:39.833 --> 06:41.700
We got a whole line
of people out there.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.102
Tudi, your boy hands
feel like they on fire, man.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.338
I been here
rubbing for...

06:46.340 --> 06:47.939
Listen, stop

06:47.941 --> 06:49.775
Falling in love
with these bitches' feet.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.510
Ten minutes max.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.912

06:53.914 --> 06:56.948
Hey, yo, boy, you good?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.020
Bitches gonna get tired

07:02.022 --> 07:03.488
(hip-hop music playing)

07:05.558 --> 07:07.426
(speaks spanish)

07:07.428 --> 07:12.197
What's up, ms. Tudi fruity,
massaging that booty?

07:13.533 --> 07:15.600
Hey, girl.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.603
Don't judge me. I got all

07:18.605 --> 07:21.606
Okay. Yeah. Go on and set up
in boonie's trunk.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.275
All right.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.277
You look like a heavy
metal mariachi singer.

07:25.279 --> 07:28.013
What is you doing?
Shut up, fat albert.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.151
(sighs): Whew.
Ms. Tudi:
Well, well, well.

07:33.153 --> 07:36.054
Oh, ms. Tudi.
(chuckles) thank you, girl.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.924
(chuckles)
mmm, thank you.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.792
(chuckles)

Get them girls in there.

07:42.463 --> 07:43.795
Hey, tudi.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.931
What about him?
What about him?

07:45.933 --> 07:47.732
How much
does he cost?

07:47.734 --> 07:49.468
I'm feeling a little stiff.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.770
I could use, like,
a full-body massage.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.738
I'm talking deep tissue.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.475
If you know
what I mean.

07:56.477 --> 08:00.412
Lookie here, deep tissue
gonna cost you a little extra.

08:04.016 --> 08:06.017
Jesus:
Ms. Tudi. Ms. Tudi.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.420
I need to
talk to you.

08:08.422 --> 08:10.422
(sighs)

08:11.524 --> 08:14.426
Hey, I'm burnt out.
Yeah, I need,

08:14.428 --> 08:15.694
Like, a ten-minute break.
I'll be right back.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.262
Just... I just need, like,
ten minutes.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.830
I'm-a do you

08:18.832 --> 08:19.831
What's that?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.600
You done for the day.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.768
You bullshittin'.
Great work.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.872
And look here. Look, look.
That's for you, partner.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.441
For me?

08:29.443 --> 08:32.010
(laughing)
(chuckles)
thank you.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.546
What about the line?
Oh, no, no, no.
The guys are gonna do that.

08:34.548 --> 08:37.516
They-they got that.
But what I do need you to do

08:37.518 --> 08:39.684
Is to go round up
some more business for tomorrow.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.686
I was thinking
maybe you could take maggie

08:41.688 --> 08:43.655
And y'all could go to the market
on normandie,

08:43.657 --> 08:44.890
Set up in front of there,

08:44.892 --> 08:46.391
And give away some free samples.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.059
Spread the word.
Spread the word!

08:48.061 --> 08:49.794
You got it. Thank you.
(chuckles)

08:49.796 --> 08:51.796
Look. Look here, look here.
God is good, ain't he?
Aw.

08:51.798 --> 08:54.533
Aw. All the time.
God is good, ain't he?

08:54.535 --> 08:57.035
That's a little something
for you. Oh!

08:58.804 --> 09:00.505
Uh...
(clears throat) ladies.

09:00.507 --> 09:03.575
Jesus had to go and do some
of the lord's work, but, um,

09:03.577 --> 09:05.577
Fish here, he's gonna
take care of you.

09:05.579 --> 09:08.480
(women cheering)
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:08.482 --> 09:10.649
Uh, excuse me. Just a minute.
Come over here, baby.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.651
I ain't said nothing
about rubbing no feet.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.686
Listen, I need you
to do this for me.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.021
Them bitches might go crazy

09:16.023 --> 09:17.756
If they don't get
their feet rubbed.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.992
Look... I got us a quarter.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.594
A quarter.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.564
I'm talking
about some good shit, fish.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.566
And it's for me?
It's for you.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.101
And all I got to do
is rub some feet?

09:30.103 --> 09:31.870
All you got to do.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.339
Just... Rub.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.674
Stuff.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.048
(women chattering)

09:43.050 --> 09:44.849
(moaning)

09:46.919 --> 09:48.219
Oh!

09:48.221 --> 09:49.254
Hey, hey!

09:49.256 --> 09:51.022
It ain't that kind of party!

09:51.024 --> 09:53.458
It's cool. I talked to tudi.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.428
I want that full-body treatment.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.929
Wait, wait.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.800
Ms. Tudi, get over here.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.069
What?

10:04.071 --> 10:06.271
Did you promise those women
I would have sex with them?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.607
No! No. Who said that?

10:08.609 --> 10:10.375
She did.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.610
I-I didn't say that.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.878
What did you say?

10:13.880 --> 10:16.247
I said that you might be open

10:16.249 --> 10:19.484
To some, uh, you know,
private service providing.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.219
I mean, you know,
kind of, remember

10:21.221 --> 10:23.755
When we were at that party
and you were stripping?

10:23.757 --> 10:26.391
Kind of like that.
You said you wouldn't tell
nobody about that.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.892
Nigga, I didn't.

10:27.894 --> 10:30.895
If you do this for me,

10:30.897 --> 10:33.398
I'm not talking weed
no more, hear?

10:33.400 --> 10:37.135
I'm talking money.
I'm talking real money.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.937
Ms. Tudi.
Hmm?

10:38.939 --> 10:40.639
Are you trying to pimp me?

10:40.641 --> 10:42.641
No, nigga.
I'm trying to get you paid

10:42.643 --> 10:44.409
For pleasuring them women.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.910
Let's make some money, hear?

10:45.912 --> 10:48.446
I'm talking
fifty-fifty.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.315
Fifty-fifty?
Mm-hmm.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.516
And how is that not pimping?

10:51.518 --> 10:53.752
Because pimps try
to control people,

10:53.754 --> 10:55.754
Take advantage of them.
Mm-hmm.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.422
I'm trying to get you paid
for your talent.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.290
I'm a talent agent.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.159
Listen, listen,
listen.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.695
God gave you a gift.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.297
He gave you the gift
of sexiness.

11:06.299 --> 11:09.134
Now, if a consenting adult

11:09.136 --> 11:12.971
Wants to pay for that talent,
what could be wrong with that?

11:12.973 --> 11:15.273
What, you expect me to have sex

11:15.275 --> 11:17.142
With 15 women
in that little trailer?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.678
I mean, I'm slanging it,
but that's-that's asking a lot.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.180
Nigga, I'm not talking
about full-on sex.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.516
I'm talking about
a little handiwork,

11:24.518 --> 11:25.984
Know what I'm saying?

11:25.986 --> 11:29.120
Come on, now.
Come on.

11:29.122 --> 11:32.490
Go on in there and handle your
business, all right? Handle it!

11:32.492 --> 11:33.692
Okay, who's next?

11:33.694 --> 11:34.693
Ooh, I can't wait!

11:34.695 --> 11:36.061
My body's shaking! Look it!

11:36.063 --> 11:37.862
(sputtering)

11:37.864 --> 11:39.531
Hey, what the (bleep)

11:39.533 --> 11:41.633
I come to get my feet massaged!

11:41.635 --> 11:43.201
Hey, excuse me, miss.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.737
I know it don't look like it,
but...

11:45.739 --> 11:49.107
My hands is nice, luxurious.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.645
What's up with you and trigger?

11:53.647 --> 11:55.814

11:55.816 --> 11:57.248
He a nice dude.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.017
But, like,

11:59.019 --> 12:00.418
It's too much work.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.087
Yeah, I can dig it.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.089
I don't even know why ms. Tudi
sent us out here, man.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.557
It was crackin' at the van, man.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.558
We was getting money.

12:07.828 --> 12:08.827
Hey, what's up, homey?

12:08.829 --> 12:12.230
Let me touch them big-ass feet.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.833
Hey, well, you got
to get your massage, homey.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.968
(woman moaning loudly)

12:19.672 --> 12:22.540
When guys do it real hard,
they compensating for something.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.042
I believe that.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.878
Woman:
Mmm. Ooh, he cute.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.179
That ain't jesus.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.586

12:46.066 --> 12:48.399

Woman: Damn, really?

12:48.401 --> 12:50.602

13:38.418 --> 13:40.451
Nigga, what'd I tell you

13:40.453 --> 13:42.921
I don't like that!
This is false advertisement!

13:42.923 --> 13:44.255
Fraud. I'm gonna sue.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.590
Sue, nigga!

13:56.937 --> 13:58.303
You don't want none of that?

13:58.305 --> 13:59.971

13:59.973 --> 14:02.140
A little.
I sometimes do that.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.108
You know, when I saw
your profile, I was like, "damn,

14:04.110 --> 14:06.611
She got a booty like beyoncé
and a face like my fiancée."

14:06.613 --> 14:07.979
I was like, "whoa."

14:07.981 --> 14:10.548
I thought I had, like, a j. Lo,

14:10.550 --> 14:12.951

Okay?
Oh, I mean, that's cool.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.170
You know, I've-I've always

14:38.478 --> 14:40.478
She had me. You know,

14:40.480 --> 14:42.046
We almost like siamese twins.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.182
D-did you just say that

14:44.184 --> 14:46.918
Oh, yeah. But it's just

14:46.920 --> 14:49.387
Okay, how temporary? How-how...

16:41.468 --> 16:43.534
Oh, they promise you the

But the only hand you'll get is

16:57.282 --> 16:58.850
Hey, baby.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.119
Um, what you doing here?

17:01.121 --> 17:03.154
Dianne: We got a report
on some illicit activity

17:03.156 --> 17:04.789
And possible prostitution
in a food truck.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.557
What are you doing here?!

17:06.559 --> 17:08.559
And with this hood rat?
Jason: Baby, listen.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.294
Let me explain, okay?

17:10.296 --> 17:11.729
Linda: Oh, god.
Jesus.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.297
I can't believe you!

17:13.299 --> 17:14.866
Is this what you call
going legit?

17:14.868 --> 17:16.968
No, no, no, let me explain.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.636
Are you a prostitute, jason?

17:18.638 --> 17:20.638
Nah, hell no,
he just the fluffer.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.839
Ooh, fluffer?

17:21.841 --> 17:22.974
Oh, so you're just a<i> puta,</i> huh?

17:22.976 --> 17:24.242
Hey, hey, I got this.
I got this.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.209
Move.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.477
Look here, j. Lo.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.380
I know my rights,
and you need a warrant.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.815
(linda screaming passionately)

17:30.817 --> 17:32.417
<i>Muévete.</i>
(ms. Tudi shouts)

17:33.585 --> 17:34.585
(gasps)

17:34.587 --> 17:35.820
Hi, dianne.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.021
What's up?
Want a foot massage?

17:37.023 --> 17:38.156
Yeah, right.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.024
Come on, out.
You're under arrest.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.325
Oh, okay, I'm gonna
finish her up real quick

17:41.327 --> 17:42.593
And I'll be right at you.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.862
Let's go, now!
Lloyd: I can't believe it.

17:44.864 --> 17:47.331
Jesus in there giving them
ladies dirty hand job.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.533
Whoo!

17:48.535 --> 17:50.034
All right,
I know how this goes.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.769
I've done this
all too many times.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.338
Dianne: You guys are
disgusting, you know that?
Jesus: What?

17:54.340 --> 17:56.507
I swear ain't nothing going on
in there but foot massages.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.509
We're not stupid.
There's no way what I heard

17:58.511 --> 18:00.078
Coming from in there
was from a foot massage.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.613
Jesus:
Oh, is that a challenge?

18:02.615 --> 18:04.348
Is-is that a challenge?
Is that...?

18:04.350 --> 18:07.752
You trying to see this
digital divinity?

18:09.755 --> 18:12.256
(man moaning and whooping
passionately)

18:16.361 --> 18:19.864
My wife never makes me
feel this good.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.199
This should be a crime,

18:21.201 --> 18:22.533
But I'm glad it's not.

18:22.535 --> 18:26.704
Thank you, weird man
dressed like jesus.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.372
(whoops)

18:28.374 --> 18:29.740
Oh, that was a
life-changer right there.

18:29.742 --> 18:30.741
Oh, my goodness.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.077
That man has a gift.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.779
I have never experienced
anything like that.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.816
That was... That was so...
Just so...

18:38.818 --> 18:40.118
Hey, do you have a twitter?

18:40.120 --> 18:41.419
'cause, you know, I wouldn't
mind just keeping in touch,

18:41.421 --> 18:43.221
You know...
Dianne: Enough!

18:43.223 --> 18:45.089
Let's go.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.724
Is it @handsofgod?

18:46.726 --> 18:49.460
'cause I saw it
around the corner over here.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.129
Dianne: Just get this
truck out of here.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.497
Baby, I know
all this look weird...

18:52.499 --> 18:54.332
Put your shirt on, jason.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.967
And wipe the lube
off your hands.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.902
It's nasty.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.504
Lloyd:
That's it?

18:59.506 --> 19:01.072
What about my foot massage,
jesus?

19:01.074 --> 19:02.974
You owe me a foot massage.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.676
Hey, you know I love y'all
to death, man.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.578
I don't really say
this often, but

19:07.580 --> 19:10.281
All y'all gonna get
struck by lightning.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.416
Hey, me, too, man?

19:12.418 --> 19:14.919
I ain't do nothing
but jag off in the bathroom

19:14.921 --> 19:17.355
To them old bitches
in the yoga pants, man.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.090
Man, I was just the fluffer.

19:19.092 --> 19:20.091
Maggie:
I didn't do anything, jesus.

19:20.093 --> 19:21.592
I was with you!

19:21.594 --> 19:23.761
Jesus!

19:23.763 --> 19:25.429
My feet need that stuff!

19:27.266 --> 19:29.600
Ms. Tudi:
Well,

19:29.602 --> 19:33.938
I know jesus is upset, but
ms. Tudi's feeling much joy.

19:33.940 --> 19:37.175
Amazing what you can do when you
have the proper representation.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.843
Oh, yeah.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.545
(laughing)

19:40.547 --> 19:43.281
Ms. Tudi, I'm starting to think
you're a bad influence on me.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.882
If I wasn't,
I wouldn't need jesus.

19:44.884 --> 19:45.950
True.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.285
He gonna forgive
us anyway.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.386
He always do.
(laughing)

19:48.388 --> 19:50.154
Badass.
Mm-hmm.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.557
