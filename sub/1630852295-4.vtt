Oh!

00:38.005 --> 00:40.000
H'okay!
Pay attention, girls.

00:41.002 --> 00:43.023
Today we are going to be
making spirit balls.

00:44.001 --> 00:45.018
Balls?
But I hate sports!

00:45.020 --> 00:47.003
What gives?

00:47.005 --> 00:50.015
I'm here to learn magic,
not do sports at some sport --

00:50.017 --> 00:52.001
Mallory,
it's not a sports ball.

00:52.003 --> 00:54.003
Obviously we all hate sports.

00:54.005 --> 00:55.014
I don't mind badminton.

00:55.016 --> 00:57.004
You're thinking
of backgammon.

00:57.006 --> 00:59.013
That's a board game,
not a sport.

00:59.015 --> 01:01.007
Ohhhhh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01.009 --> 01:02.013
I hate sports.

01:02.015 --> 01:04.006
Girls.

01:04.008 --> 01:07.017
A spirit ball exists to entrap
spirits and keep them occupied

01:07.019 --> 01:09.018
so they don't occupy <i>you.</i>

01:09.020 --> 01:11.019
You know, witches attract
more spirits

01:11.021 --> 01:13.023
than any other
magical creatures.

01:14.001 --> 01:16.017
Is it our musk?
Do we need to wear deodorant?

01:16.019 --> 01:18.019
Because I don't wanna
wear deodorant.

01:18.021 --> 01:20.007
No,
it's not our musk.

01:20.009 --> 01:23.007
Although now you've got me
thinking about <i>my</i> <i>musk.</i>

01:25.022 --> 01:29.004
Spirits love us becausewitches are deeply connected

01:29.006 --> 01:30.020
to the spiritual realm.

01:30.022 --> 01:33.000
They're always trying to get up
in our action,

01:33.002 --> 01:35.017
and make a nice little home
for themselves,

01:35.019 --> 01:38.012
which is bad because
there's no room for us

01:38.014 --> 01:40.020
in our own sweet,
musky bodies.

01:40.022 --> 01:44.007
Not only that, but over time
the spirits will bend the body

01:44.009 --> 01:46.012
to fit
their own past qualities.

01:46.014 --> 01:48.005
Your spirit ball has to be
very beautiful

01:48.007 --> 01:51.004
and attractive on the outside
to draw the spirits toward it.

01:51.006 --> 01:52.017
And inside is a coax,

01:52.019 --> 01:55.010
something impossible for
the spirits to try and solve.

01:55.012 --> 01:57.018
My coax is made up of
several charm bracelets

01:57.020 --> 02:00.002
that were previously forgotten
in a backpack.

02:00.004 --> 02:01.022
The spirits are trying
to untangle it.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.015
Mine's a receipt from
a 14-person dinner

02:04.017 --> 02:07.012
where not everyone
had an appetizer.

02:07.014 --> 02:10.006
The spirits are trying
to figure out who owes what.

02:10.008 --> 02:12.021
Did you include tip?
10%.

02:12.023 --> 02:16.004
10?! We're not monsters!
Always tip 20.

02:16.006 --> 02:20.013
You guys will be filling out
your spirit balls in pairs.

02:20.015 --> 02:23.002
Opie, you're with Agatha.

02:23.004 --> 02:24.013
Rosie, Sarah.

02:24.015 --> 02:26.002
And... Mallory --

02:26.004 --> 02:27.022
Let me stop you right there.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.005
I'm an individual,
so I don't need a partner.

02:31.007 --> 02:34.007
That's great!
You can be paired with Emma.

02:34.009 --> 02:36.017
She is also an individual.

02:36.019 --> 02:37.023
Dang it.

02:38.001 --> 02:39.021
And here are the vessels
you will be using

02:39.023 --> 02:41.004
for your spirit balls.

02:41.006 --> 02:43.005
Decorate them
however you like.

02:43.007 --> 02:45.019
So, uh, where do you want
to find our coax?

02:45.021 --> 02:48.006
I was thinking maybe we could
go to the beach,

02:48.008 --> 02:50.002
maybe get a spirally conch,

02:50.004 --> 02:52.015
do something
with numerical harmony?

02:54.005 --> 02:55.021
'Kay.
Good talk.

02:57.017 --> 02:58.021
Uhh!

02:58.023 --> 03:02.014
So, do you know what
we're looking for, coaxwise?

03:02.016 --> 03:05.013
'Cause I have some ideas.
I-If you want me to lead.

03:05.015 --> 03:07.001
I'm happy to lead.

03:07.003 --> 03:08.023
Okay, I'm just
spitballing here,

03:09.001 --> 03:13.015
but, uh, if everything
that exists has a place,

03:13.017 --> 03:16.014
what place does place have?

03:16.016 --> 03:20.022
Lichen?
W-Where's the mystique in that?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.012
I really don't see where
you're going

03:22.014 --> 03:24.006
with any of these things.

03:24.008 --> 03:25.015
Gross bugs?

03:25.017 --> 03:29.000
I mean, I guess any spirit
could try and, I don't know,

03:29.002 --> 03:31.013
find the beauty in...

03:31.015 --> 03:32.016
Oh.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.010
Ehh, no, thank you.

03:37.016 --> 03:40.023
Oh, yeah!
Emma, this looks great!

03:41.001 --> 03:42.020
Maybe we can find
a weird stalagmite

03:42.022 --> 03:44.018
that looks
like the president's head.

03:44.020 --> 03:46.020
They'll have to guess
which president.

03:46.022 --> 03:49.002
Oh.
Of course.

03:49.004 --> 03:51.010
Choose the smallest hole.

03:52.012 --> 03:55.019
Emma?
How did you even get in here?

03:55.021 --> 03:58.023
Emma!
Hello?

03:59.001 --> 04:00.011
Oh, gross!
Oh, no!

04:00.013 --> 04:02.013
Uh, Emma!
Emma, I'm stuck.

04:02.015 --> 04:03.018
Can you -- Emma?

04:03.020 --> 04:06.009
What the heck?!
What is wrong with you?!

04:08.013 --> 04:09.018
Emma?

04:09.020 --> 04:11.013
Emma!

04:11.015 --> 04:12.019
Wait, what is that?

04:12.021 --> 04:15.005
A tiny vine?
What's that gonna do?

04:15.007 --> 04:16.020
Uh!

04:19.006 --> 04:22.019
Emma, stop bopping me
on the nose.

04:22.021 --> 04:24.008
It's gonna make me...

04:24.010 --> 04:26.001
Ah...ah...

04:26.003 --> 04:27.016
Ah-choo!

04:27.018 --> 04:29.020
Ohh!

04:31.019 --> 04:35.017
Well,
thank you for that.

04:35.019 --> 04:37.018
So I still don't know...
Emma!

04:37.020 --> 04:41.000
...what you're looking for,
for our coax.

04:41.002 --> 04:43.005
Emma!

04:43.007 --> 04:45.016
How do you have
so many friends here?

04:45.018 --> 04:47.021
Are you like
an island local?

04:47.023 --> 04:50.003
Emma, hello!

04:53.002 --> 04:56.005
Okay. Is this why
you don't talk to us?

04:56.007 --> 04:58.001
Are you actually
not a loser,

04:58.003 --> 05:01.004
but rather the most
popular person on the island,

05:01.006 --> 05:03.011
on this planet?

05:03.013 --> 05:05.017
What is happening?

05:10.016 --> 05:12.001
Wow.
Forget it.

05:12.003 --> 05:13.022
Our coax should just be
the mystery

05:14.000 --> 05:15.005
of your
forest popularity.

05:15.007 --> 05:17.011
Wait.

05:17.013 --> 05:19.014
Emma.
What's our plan?

05:19.016 --> 05:22.001
Ugh!
Say something!

05:23.009 --> 05:26.005
All right, ladies, I see youall did a charmingly pathetic job

05:26.007 --> 05:27.017
decorating your spirit balls.

05:27.019 --> 05:29.013
I hope
you all found something.

05:29.015 --> 05:31.004
Late!
Sorry.

05:31.006 --> 05:33.011
You all signed the waivers,
so we're not responsible

05:33.013 --> 05:35.002
if you end up possessed
by the spirit

05:35.004 --> 05:36.023
of a crumpled-up napkin
or a pine cone

05:37.001 --> 05:39.018
or, heaven forbid,
a stamp collector.

05:39.020 --> 05:43.000
Sarah, Rosie,
the coax is meant to be

05:43.002 --> 05:45.007
inside your spirit ball.

05:47.021 --> 05:49.010
Whew!

05:49.012 --> 05:52.023
Nice job, girls!
Ghosts hate maths.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.023
Luciola, Nancy,
we'll start with you.

05:59.001 --> 06:00.003
Tell us about your coax.

06:00.005 --> 06:01.013
Our coax
requires the spirit

06:01.015 --> 06:04.007
to draw a flattering portrait
of you, Susie.

06:04.009 --> 06:08.003
Wow, that is very specific!

06:08.005 --> 06:10.011
Also a terrible idea,
I'm afraid.

06:10.013 --> 06:13.002
Ghosts are fantastic artists
capable of capturing

06:13.004 --> 06:15.001
even the subtlest hints
of beauty.

06:15.003 --> 06:16.015
You said it,
not us.

06:16.017 --> 06:19.007
This is quite unsafe,
but here goes.

06:21.009 --> 06:23.011
Wooooooo!

06:23.013 --> 06:24.011
Woooo!

06:24.013 --> 06:27.007
He-- Hey!
I'm a free dweeb!

06:27.009 --> 06:30.003
Oh, dang,
look at those stickers!

06:30.005 --> 06:31.007
What's in the orb,
huh?

06:31.009 --> 06:32.017
No one's
gonna say anything?

06:32.019 --> 06:35.012
Well, I'm just gonna take
a peek real quick.

06:35.014 --> 06:36.018
Oh, come on!

06:36.020 --> 06:39.019
I am good,
but no one is <i>this</i> <i>good.</i>

06:39.021 --> 06:42.018
I am straight-up
never getting out of here.

06:42.020 --> 06:44.016
Lock the tears away,
Suse.

06:44.018 --> 06:47.008
No one has time for tears.

06:47.010 --> 06:49.011
All right, who's next?

06:49.013 --> 06:52.011
Wow, I'm honestly surprised
with how well it's gone so
far.

06:52.013 --> 06:54.021
Emma, Mallory,
looks like the pressure's on.

06:54.023 --> 06:56.004
Tell us about your coax.

06:56.006 --> 06:58.021
Go ahead
and tell her, Emma!

06:58.023 --> 07:00.008
Say something.

07:00.010 --> 07:02.007
Well,
we, uh,

07:02.009 --> 07:08.018
decided to go with something
very mysterious indeed.

07:08.020 --> 07:10.018
Very mysterious, huh?

07:10.020 --> 07:12.004
Yeah, I'll roll the dice
on that.

07:12.006 --> 07:15.004
Or you don't have to.

07:15.006 --> 07:16.008
No, I will.

07:16.010 --> 07:19.004
Woe is me!

07:19.006 --> 07:22.008
I'm a soggy ol' log.

07:22.010 --> 07:23.019
Oh!

07:23.021 --> 07:25.002
Ohh!

07:25.004 --> 07:27.004
Ohhhh!
What? No!
I don't want it!

07:27.006 --> 07:28.019
There's nothing in it!
Aah!

07:28.021 --> 07:29.023
Ooooh!

07:30.001 --> 07:32.002
Ooh!

07:32.004 --> 07:35.000
Ohh, so boring!

07:35.002 --> 07:36.012
What's this, though?

07:36.014 --> 07:38.002
Oooh!

07:38.004 --> 07:40.013
Ah...ah...ah!

07:40.015 --> 07:43.013
I'm a soggy old log!

07:44.018 --> 07:46.023
And of course
Mallory's been possessed

07:47.001 --> 07:48.012
by the spirit
of a soggy old log.

07:48.014 --> 07:51.003
We should perform
an exercism immediately!

07:51.005 --> 07:53.008
We can't
lose her spirit!

07:53.010 --> 07:55.016
But exercisms
are so exhausting!

07:55.018 --> 07:58.007
Plus, we won't lose <i>her,</i>
we'll just lose her
personality,

07:58.009 --> 08:00.015
and her personality is...

08:00.017 --> 08:02.015
Maybe she'll be better
as a soggy old log.

08:02.017 --> 08:06.006
Susie!
It is our duty to save her.

08:06.008 --> 08:08.001
Fine!

08:08.003 --> 08:09.010
Well, great job, Emma.

08:09.012 --> 08:11.010
Looks like we're gonna have
to perform an exercism.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.023
Blblblblblbl!

08:13.001 --> 08:14.017
Exorcism, yes!

08:14.019 --> 08:15.022
Do what you gotta do!

08:16.000 --> 08:18.021
Hold me down!
Read at me from an old book!

08:18.023 --> 08:20.013
Ohh, no.

08:20.015 --> 08:23.007
An "ex-er-cism."

08:23.009 --> 08:24.010
With exercise.

08:24.012 --> 08:27.022
<i>I'm old and wet
and can't move!</i>

08:28.000 --> 08:29.020
Susie, no!

08:29.022 --> 08:31.005
We hate sports!

08:31.007 --> 08:34.004
And exercise is just sports
without points!

08:34.006 --> 08:35.022
<i>Pointless!</i>

08:36.000 --> 08:38.017
Believe me, I don't
wanna do this either.

08:38.019 --> 08:42.005
But it's our
"duty to save her."

08:42.007 --> 08:45.005
One and one and two and two
and 'round the door,

08:45.007 --> 08:46.013
touch the floor.

08:46.015 --> 08:48.017
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy
like you're 10:00 and 4:00.

08:48.019 --> 08:51.015
<i>I speak the language
of the moss and lichen!</i>

08:51.017 --> 08:54.004
Perhaps you need to move
her body manually?

08:54.006 --> 08:57.004
I love my job, I love my job.

08:57.006 --> 09:00.002
Oh, she's so heavy.

09:00.004 --> 09:01.016
Roll her?

09:01.018 --> 09:04.011
Thank you for all your help
and advice, Ramona.

09:04.013 --> 09:05.007
And one...

09:05.009 --> 09:07.010
<i>And wet and log and log</i>

09:07.012 --> 09:10.015
<i>and a soggy, soggy, soggy
like a rotten old bog.</i>

09:10.017 --> 09:11.019
Whew!

09:11.021 --> 09:13.015
Okay, this is humiliating
for both of us,

09:13.017 --> 09:15.000
and it should've
worked by now.

09:15.002 --> 09:17.008
She's too stiff
to exercise manually!

09:17.010 --> 09:19.014
Can we please explore
other options?

09:19.016 --> 09:22.009
Also, I love my musk,
but this is too much musk.

09:22.011 --> 09:27.006
It's exercism, or poor Mallory
stays a soggy old log forever.

09:27.008 --> 09:29.014
<i>I'm soaking wet
and on the ground,</i>

09:29.016 --> 09:31.018
<i>and I weigh
just 2,000 pounds.</i>

09:31.020 --> 09:32.023
All right, listen up!

09:33.001 --> 09:34.018
If we combine
our witchy, witchy strength,

09:34.020 --> 09:36.002
maybe we can overpower
this spirit

09:36.004 --> 09:38.010
and force Mallory to exercise
with magic!

09:38.012 --> 09:40.011
<i>I'm no use as firewood!</i>

09:40.013 --> 09:43.002
Aim your wands...now!

09:43.004 --> 09:45.023
Spirit, spirit, burning bright,

09:46.001 --> 09:48.015
please let our friend
get nice and tight.

09:48.017 --> 09:51.018
Spirit, spirit,
slow your roll,

09:51.020 --> 09:54.010
please give her back
some self-control.

09:54.012 --> 09:56.013
One and one
and two and two

09:56.015 --> 09:58.022
and one and one
and two and two and --

09:59.000 --> 10:00.012
She's too far gone!

10:00.014 --> 10:02.008
She's going full log!

10:05.014 --> 10:07.013
Ah -- Ah -- Ah-choo!

10:07.015 --> 10:09.003
Ohhh!

10:09.005 --> 10:11.023
I'm fre-e-e-e-e!

10:12.001 --> 10:14.002
Whoa!

10:14.004 --> 10:15.017
We did it, girls!

10:15.019 --> 10:17.022
Yeah, I don't think
<i>we</i> <i>did.</i>

10:21.010 --> 10:24.006
Emma,
you are full of surprises!

10:24.008 --> 10:28.005
I'd completely forgotten about
the lost art of sneezercism.

10:28.007 --> 10:30.002
Yeah yeah, but you gotta go
catch that spirit you let escape

10:30.004 --> 10:31.020
and bring it
back here pronto.

10:31.022 --> 10:33.021
Don't you dare
leave us hanging!

10:33.023 --> 10:35.007
She does.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.013
She left us hanging.

10:36.015 --> 10:38.008
Who could've predicted?

10:38.010 --> 10:40.015
It's getting dark.
I'm assembling a search party!

10:40.017 --> 10:43.012
Actually,
I'm sure she's just fine.

10:43.014 --> 10:45.000
Ehh, you're probably right.

10:45.002 --> 10:48.002
Well, if we're not going out,
I'm wearing this to bed.

11:02.020 --> 11:05.006
Emma!

11:18.015 --> 11:20.016
Emma, hello!
