When I was 17, I was diagnosed
as manic-depressive.

00:05.547 --> 00:08.091
The problem is, the medication’s
killing my sex drive.

00:08.216 --> 00:09.759
That’s why you’ve been acting
the way you were?

00:09.884 --> 00:11.094
I’m gonna go back on my medication.

00:11.219 --> 00:13.847
Mr. Peeler, I’m releasing you

forced Peeler to commit to.

You’re trying to blame me for this?
Aren't ya?

We believe Cindy
may have known her assailant.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.891
-Was he saying anything when you got here?
-No, a neighbor lady called it in.

00:58.224 --> 01:01.186
Said he moved in three months ago,
was separated from his wife.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.604

01:09.319 --> 01:12.405
I’ll call it into the squad.
Have ’em run this Traylor through B.C.I.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.289
So what’s the pecking order here
as far as suspects?

01:21.998 --> 01:23.708
Well, the guy Cindy Clifton
used to baby-sit for,

01:23.792 --> 01:26.044
his DNA came back negative.
So he’s off the list.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.296
-And Cindy’s dad lawyered up?
-Right.

01:28.379 --> 01:30.298

But I thought the dad
lawyered the whole family up.

He can’t do that, even if she’s a suspect.
Which she’s not, right?

01:38.264 --> 01:40.141
Everybody in that family’s a suspect.

Mrs. Clifton, do you
have a minute to speak with us?

04:22.804 --> 04:24.889
I don’t think my husband
would approve of this.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.307
Why not?

04:26.516 --> 04:29.727
Because when you
ask him for a sample of DNA,

04:30.061 --> 04:32.689
it made it look like you think
he killed our daughter.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.774
We’re not accusing anyone of anything.

04:35.316 --> 04:39.153
We only wanted your husband’s DNA sample.
So we could eliminate him as a suspect.

staying with you.

you don’t want us looking into this.

For a long time,
but he cleaned up a year ago.

’Cause the apartment looked like

whoever shot him was looking for something
that was hidden.

is what turned his life around.

and you had to come to his work and see me
hitting on him and flirting with him,

10:48.105 --> 10:50.191
all the while knowing
he was with someone else?

10:50.274 --> 10:52.360
And even though you came to me
and asked me nicely

10:52.443 --> 10:55.237
to respect your relationship with him,
I lied right to your face.

As you probably know, we’re, uh...

12:06.058 --> 12:08.310
We’re starting from scratch here
on the death of your niece.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.020
I’m well aware of that.

12:10.104 --> 12:13.149
Your brother, Gerald, has been somewhat
reluctant to cooperate with us.

12:13.232 --> 12:17.111
Would you want to relive the death of your
daughter all over again, after 18 years?

12:17.278 --> 12:19.780
No, but it’s unavoidable at this point.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.241
Why am I here?

12:22.324 --> 12:24.160
We have reason to believe Cindy
may have known her assailant.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.745
-And you think I did it?
-No.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.497
We’re just looking to see if you remember
anything from that weekend.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.666
Sharon Clifton provided us with a list

12:30.750 --> 12:32.960
of people who were at their apartment
the weekend Cindy was killed.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.211
We’re going through the list.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.589
-And she put my name on it?
-Were you not there?

12:36.714 --> 12:39.133
No, I was. I’m just curious.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.721
Did she put her nephew’s name
on that list? Sam Jeffers?

12:44.972 --> 12:45.973
No.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.975
Was Sam at their apartment
the night Cindy was killed?

12:48.225 --> 12:51.479
I’ll tell you what, go ask Sharon
about Sam, her nephew.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.773
-Why? What’s the significance?
-Ask Sharon.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.525
We prefer this didn’t turn
into a board game, Mr. Clifton.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.903
Tell Sharon I told you guys
to ask her about her nephew.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.739
-You know anything about Cindy’s murder?
-Certainly not.

13:01.822 --> 13:04.074
Then you won’t have a problem
providing a DNA sample.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.870
The way you ask that so matter-of-factly,
now I understand Gerald’s rage.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.581
Mr. Clifton,
you seem like an intelligent man.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.124
Put yourself in our shoes.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.170
(SIGHS) How do I go about doing this?

13:16.253 --> 13:18.798
We don't have the equipment here but
I have the address to the lab at my desk.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.132
You can head down there right now.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.847
-Sam Jeffers, you ask Sharon about him.
-Yeah. We got it.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.651
Hey, that’s the massage parlor.
The one we found in all those photos.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.069
Yeah.

There’s more hope of a fool than of him.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.724
The same mistakes
we make over and over are vomit.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.685
When will we stop returning to them?

14:14.061 --> 14:15.479
Think about that as you prepare lunch.

14:18.607 --> 14:21.694
-Beautiful sermon, Reverend.
-Thank you, Doris.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.404
Just beautiful.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.033
-Detectives Medavoy and Jones.
-Reverend Mercy Hawks.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.370
-Is Kevin Traylor a member of your church?
-He is.

14:31.453 --> 14:34.081
Well, Kevin was shot at his apartment
this morning.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.374
Is he all right?

14:35.583 --> 14:37.501
Well, he’s in critical condition
at Bellevue.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.297
Do you know of anyone
who Kevin was at odds with?

14:43.173 --> 14:44.174
No, Kevin...

14:44.675 --> 14:46.802
Kevin is as devoted a Christian
as I’ve ever known.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.471
Well, we understand
he’s separated from his wife.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.141
Was there any acrimony there
as far as you know?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.602
Well, no breakup is pleasant,

14:54.685 --> 14:57.813
but, as I said,
Kevin is a devoted Christian.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.275
I highly doubt he could let anything
get acrimonious with anyone.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.778
Reverend, we found a bunch
of photos in Kevin’s apartment.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.657
They were all of different cars
parked at the massage parlor next door.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.992
You know anything about this?

15:10.075 --> 15:15.039
Ah, yes, those sodomites opened up
that den of sin about five months ago.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.166
No, I mean, do you know anything
about the pictures?

15:17.499 --> 15:18.751
I don’t, I don't.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.754
But Kevin’s duties as a minister
of community outreach

15:21.837 --> 15:26.342
included trying to educate the sodomites
who run and frequent that establishment.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.761
How he’s going about doing that,
I’m not privy.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.222
All right, so Kevin getting shot,
this is totally out of the blue?

15:32.306 --> 15:34.224
You can’t imagine any reason
anybody would do it?

15:35.893 --> 15:38.103
Most of us here led sinful lives

15:38.187 --> 15:40.564
in what we here call "BGG,"
Before God’s Grace.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.818
It’s no secret that BGG Kevin
was involved in drugs and drug sales.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.820
I just pray someone
from his past didn’t come back.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.198
All right, we’ll look into that.
Thank you.

15:49.365 --> 15:52.201
Oh, uh, one more thing,
Reverend Hawks, uh,

15:52.576 --> 15:54.078
if we could just get your real name.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.871
So you can run my record?

15:56.664 --> 15:59.667
I can tell you up front,
I was an inveterate sinner in my youth.

15:59.917 --> 16:03.212
-Yeah, we just need it for the files.
-Roy Nutt, two "t's".

16:04.880 --> 16:06.757
If we have any more questions,
we’ll be in touch.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.884
I’ll be here, praying for Kevin.

16:17.184 --> 16:18.268
Sam Jeffers.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.814
Was he at your apartment the weekend
your daughter was killed?

16:23.148 --> 16:25.776
He might have been. It was so long ago.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.736
Why didn’t you put Sam on the list
you gave us?

16:27.861 --> 16:30.239
Sam was 16 at the time.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.408
There’s no way
he would have killed Cindy.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.784
That’s something we’ll determine.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.828
-Is Sam your nephew?
-Yes.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.414
So why would your brother-in-law Simon
spit out the word "nephew"

16:38.539 --> 16:39.581
like it was dipped in vinegar?

16:41.458 --> 16:43.085
We’ll find Sam and ask him ourselves.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.796
Oh, I bet my brother-in-law
took great pleasure

16:45.921 --> 16:47.089
in telling you about this.

16:47.589 --> 16:48.924
Why the mystery, Mrs. Clifton?

16:49.299 --> 16:51.135
Sam has already been through enough.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.469
What’s going on?

16:54.722 --> 16:56.181
(SIGHS)

16:56.265 --> 16:57.599
He’s my son.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.394
Sam is my son.

17:01.395 --> 17:04.690
Before I met Gerald, I got pregnant,

17:04.773 --> 17:07.860
and there was a lot of shame
in that with my family.

17:08.235 --> 17:13.532
So my parents gave Sam
to friends of the family to raise.

17:14.324 --> 17:18.287
When Gerald and I got engaged,
Gerald... his request,

17:18.370 --> 17:21.248
his condition was that Sam could visit us.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.334
But we had to tell people
that Sam was my nephew

17:24.710 --> 17:26.170
to avoid embarrassment.

17:26.712 --> 17:30.257
I agreed, and that’s the way it was.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.093
Did Sam know you were his real mom?

17:33.927 --> 17:36.555
So when he came to visit you,
he had to play along with the lie?

17:37.389 --> 17:39.808
That’s a lot for a kid to deal with.
Did he act out?

17:39.975 --> 17:41.351
He didn’t kill Cindy.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.312
Sam was staying with you
the weekend Cindy was murdered.

17:44.813 --> 17:45.814
Yes.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.775
-Is he still in New York?
-I think so.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.986
We haven’t spoken in a long time... years.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.072
We’re gonna need to talk to Sam.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.996
We got the dump back
on Kevin Traylor’s phone.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.164
We’re still wading through it,

18:02.331 --> 18:05.542
but there was some back-and-forth over
the last few days with a Lonnie Wells.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.252
So we’re starting with him.
He’s on his way up.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.378
Okay, thanks.

but still in critical condition.

hangs in there, the better his chances.

who screwed up the Peeler case.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.236
Anyways...

18:32.402 --> 18:34.863
So Peeler is officially in the clear now?

18:34.988 --> 18:37.825
Yeah, D.A.'S office
notified Peeler’s attorney

18:37.908 --> 18:39.201
they’re not gonna refile.

18:39.701 --> 18:41.620
They’re all meeting later today
to finalize it.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.873
You know, I was thinking,
maybe you should be looking

18:45.040 --> 18:46.542
at sex offenders
who got released in that area

18:46.667 --> 18:48.001
prior to the murder.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.753
We’ve been looking at that, yeah.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.880
I still got some connections.
I could help out.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.298

-What were the calls about?
-What’s he saying?

-That’s not how it works.
-Well, what he’s doing is harassment,

20:37.361 --> 20:39.363
right? I mean,
I’m not proud of what I did.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.822
What’s your version
of the events, Mr. Wells?

20:42.866 --> 20:46.995
I get this postcard.
I get pissed, so I call him.

that we’re visitors from another planet,

20:56.463 --> 20:58.465
and my wife’s got
all of my clothes out in the hallway.

20:58.548 --> 20:59.633
So I’m, like, "what’s up?"

20:59.841 --> 21:01.677
She shows me a postcard
that came in the mail.

21:01.885 --> 21:05.389
It’s a picture of my car parked in front
of this massage parlor in Queens.

21:06.181 --> 21:08.225
And on the back, it say something like,

21:08.558 --> 21:10.477
"Thanks for stopping by the neighborhood.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.022
"Any time you want to talk about
Jesus, please call."

21:14.481 --> 21:16.358
And it has this nut case name and number.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.651
All right, so you called.

21:17.776 --> 21:18.944
I said, "Hell, yeah.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.321
"Let’s meet face-to-face
and talk about Jesus."

21:21.989 --> 21:24.449
And he gives me his address.
I go over there.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.035
I tell him,
"If you ever send a postcard

21:27.160 --> 21:30.289
"like this again to my home,
you gonna meet Jesus

21:30.539 --> 21:32.541
"a whole lot quicker
than you planned on."

21:33.166 --> 21:35.294
Did you go back over
to Kevin’s apartment today?

No.

21:37.587 --> 21:38.630
What?

21:38.797 --> 21:41.383
Somebody went by his apartment
and shot him in the chest.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.636
No way, not me.

If Kevin pulls through,
and doctors are saying it’s likely,

21:48.473 --> 21:50.267

it’s gonna get a lot worse.

-Where have you been this morning?

21:53.854 --> 21:55.939
Look, making the rounds. I’m in sales.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.233
So you went all the way
over to his apartment

21:58.358 --> 22:00.277
just to issue a warning,
you could have told him on the phone?

22:00.610 --> 22:04.323
Look, I’m gonna be completely
honest with you.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.532
Good.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.248
Okay? I did not shoot him.

Is that what Kevin Traylor’s
gonna tell us?

different, he’s a liar.

-She did.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.028
SAM: Uh, not really.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.530
I mean, I know the guy
who was convicted for killing Cindy

22:45.614 --> 22:46.782
didn’t actually do it.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.575
So it’s back to an open case now.

22:48.658 --> 22:51.036
-Is my mom still married to Gerald?
-Yeah.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.330
-Huh.
-You can smoke if you like.

22:55.957 --> 22:57.334
Uh, no, I’m all right.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.128
What we’re looking at now
is the possibility

23:00.337 --> 23:02.881
that Cindy knew the person
who raped and killed her.

23:03.131 --> 23:04.132
Okay.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.637
You stayed with them off and on, right?

23:09.554 --> 23:12.432
You must have had a sense
of what home life was like for Cindy.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.519
I had to tell everybody
I was my mom’s nephew. (SCOFFS)

23:16.019 --> 23:17.437
-Did you know that?
-Yeah.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.648
-Pretty crazy, huh?
-That’s up there.

23:20.107 --> 23:23.318
My mom had no backbone,
and Gerald was a domineering prick, huh.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.613
When I was 18,
I finally confronted my mom,

23:27.614 --> 23:28.990
and that’s when we stopped talking.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.829
What was the question?

23:34.246 --> 23:36.373
-Were you close with Cindy?
-Yeah.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.126
Yeah, I mean, she was too young
to get caught up

23:39.209 --> 23:40.335
in all that family craziness.

23:40.460 --> 23:43.547
Did she ever confide in you
about being afraid of anyone, any men?

23:43.713 --> 23:46.383
No... no, she was into her Barbies.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.386
Nothing comes to mind
as far as who may have had

23:49.511 --> 23:50.720
an inappropriate relationship with her?

23:51.012 --> 23:52.055
No, man.

23:53.390 --> 23:56.309
Hey, did my mom... never mind.

23:56.476 --> 23:57.477
What?

23:57.894 --> 24:00.439
Did she have a message to give me
or did she say anything like that?

24:00.856 --> 24:03.525
She’s really upset about having to relive
this whole thing again.

24:03.733 --> 24:06.736
No. I got it.

24:08.029 --> 24:10.282
(SIGHS)

24:12.284 --> 24:14.911
-Anything else?
-As we sort through this, uh,

24:14.995 --> 24:16.913
I’m sure we’re gonna
have a lot of questions for you.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.707
You don’t mind if we keep in touch,
do you?

24:19.458 --> 24:20.584
No, that’s cool.

24:21.334 --> 24:22.544
Thanks.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.174
See ya.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.929
We gotta take a hard look at this guy.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.222
Yeah.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.695
What’s going on with your gunshot victim?

24:49.237 --> 24:52.407
We’re still checking
the alibi of Lonnie Wells,

24:52.532 --> 24:54.367
the guy who confronted
Kevin Traylor yesterday.

24:54.576 --> 24:55.660
Over the massage-parlor thing?

24:55.827 --> 24:57.996
Yeah, he has a sales route
through the city,

24:58.121 --> 24:59.247
so it’s a little tough pinning down

24:59.331 --> 25:00.957
how long it takes to get
from one place to another.

25:01.041 --> 25:04.169
We’re getting a list of people
Traylor sent postcards to.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.378
It’s a long list.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.881
I was looking through some stuff
found at Traylor’s apartment,

25:07.964 --> 25:11.009
a bunch of bumper stickers.
"Jesus or hell, your choice."

25:11.259 --> 25:13.929
-Now, what kind of attitude is that?
-An extreme one, obviously.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.764
What happened to "love thy neighbor"?

25:15.847 --> 25:17.891
JOHN: 15th squad, one moment, please.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.852
-Gerald Clifton.
-JOHN: Oh, boy.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.563
Detective Sipowicz.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.692
All right. All right, I’ll be right down.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.736
He wants to talk down at his apartment.

25:29.861 --> 25:31.154
-What about?
-He didn’t say.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.783
15th squad. Bellevue.

25:36.493 --> 25:37.827
Detective Ronson.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.789
-Detective Jones?
-Yeah, right here.

25:41.623 --> 25:42.958
Ken Uggams, crime-scene unit.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.961
Found this in Kevin Traylor’s
apartment, taped under dressing drawer.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.045
Thought you might be interested.

25:47.128 --> 25:48.338
-What is it?
-Videotape.

25:48.505 --> 25:49.714
All right, thanks.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.509
(SIGHS) Kevin Traylor just went out
of the picture.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.303
(SIGHS)

25:55.845 --> 25:57.138
All right, let’s take a look at this.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.186
ANDY: What was Sam like back then?

26:03.270 --> 26:07.691
(SIGHS) Oh, withdrawn... angry, I guess.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.485
I know we bear
some of the responsibility for that.

26:11.194 --> 26:13.405
Did you ask us to come
down here because you feel

26:13.488 --> 26:15.657
that Sam may have been
involved in Cindy’s death?

26:16.449 --> 26:18.159
Oh... I don’t know.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.288
But it’s out in the open now,
so there’s nothing else to hide.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.791
We, uh, we never took Cindy’s stuff down.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.419
I don’t know if there’s anything
that can be of help, but you can look.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.088
I ask that you don’t disturb it
any more than you need to.

26:30.505 --> 26:32.215
Well, we’ll be as respectful as possible.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.551
I, uh...

26:35.135 --> 26:37.762
I apologize for my behavior
at your office today.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.139
-I just...
-We understand.

26:44.185 --> 26:46.313
I’ll, um, I’ll be in the living room.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.439
Okay.

27:04.831 --> 27:06.207
This is brutal.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.174
Reverend...

27:15.342 --> 27:16.968
Would it surprise you to know

27:17.052 --> 27:21.222
that we’re in possession of
a tape that shows you having sex

27:21.389 --> 27:23.141
with Kevin Traylor’s wife, Donna?

27:25.185 --> 27:26.311
It’s a "yes" or "no" question.

27:30.398 --> 27:31.524
I’m aware of the tape.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.692
GREG: Who made it?

27:33.777 --> 27:34.778
As far as I know, Kevin did.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.489
After he moved out of the apartment
that he and Donna shared.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.407
He went back and hooked up
a hidden camera.

27:40.116 --> 27:41.326
I believe he thought she was unfaithful,

27:41.451 --> 27:43.620
and it was his intention
to be certain of it.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.538
Again, that’s as far as I know.

27:46.581 --> 27:47.999
Did Kevin confront you about it?

27:48.291 --> 27:51.378
Well, there was no confrontation.
We spoke about it... once.

27:51.711 --> 27:53.421
I advised him to get his house in order

27:53.630 --> 27:56.758
and also to try to get Donna
to submit to him, as a wife should.

27:57.050 --> 28:00.136
-A friendly conversation.
-It was calm, respectful.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.597
He sees a tape showing
you having sex with his wife

28:02.681 --> 28:04.557
and tying her up
and beating her with a belt.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.059
But he stays calm.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.228
Donna is a sinful woman.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.480
I’ve been telling Kevin that
for a long time now.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.024
She... she seduced me.

28:13.149 --> 28:16.403
-(SCOFFS)
-Donna, who’s borderline doormat,

28:16.528 --> 28:21.449
suddenly turns into a jezebel
and seduces you into having sex

28:21.533 --> 28:23.910
and pulling those S&amp;M moves on her?

28:24.285 --> 28:29.582
The devil also works in mysterious ways,
and I fell victim to him through Donna.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.085
-Is Donna aware of the tape?
-Yes.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.254
She and I spoke about it once, as well.

28:34.796 --> 28:37.632
I told her that God had forgiven us both,
and that would be the end of it.

28:38.174 --> 28:40.218
-Donna’s a member of your church also?
-She is.

28:40.427 --> 28:42.595
Do you know what happened
at Kevin Traylor’s apartment this morning?

28:42.679 --> 28:43.930
No.

28:44.305 --> 28:45.890
How do you know
this wasn’t a random crime?

28:46.015 --> 28:49.018
Well, whoever went to that apartment and
shot him was looking for that videotape.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.229
-Well, it wasn’t me.
-Well, where were you?

28:51.479 --> 28:53.815
At my church, there’s people there
who can verify that.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.276
What, "people" meaning
parishioners who would jump

28:56.359 --> 28:58.278
when you tell them to,
and would have no problem lying?

28:58.611 --> 29:01.072
"People" meaning my contractor
and his three workers

29:01.156 --> 29:02.615
who have been remodeling the kitchen.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.745
I understand it’s your job to suspect
everyone,

29:06.828 --> 29:09.414
but, hopefully, Kevin will pull through
this thing, and he can tell you himself.

29:09.622 --> 29:10.999
Mm-mmm, he’s dead.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.668
This is a homicide now, Reverend.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.928
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

29:25.847 --> 29:27.557
We’re just trying
to get a little more information

29:27.682 --> 29:30.101
as to what was going on the weekend
Cindy was killed.

29:31.728 --> 29:34.397
-Okay.
-So you and Cindy, you got along?

29:35.356 --> 29:36.357
Yeah.

29:36.524 --> 29:38.693
’Cause now that this whole
secret’s come to light,

29:38.860 --> 29:41.070
it seems like it’d be tough for you
to visit that apartment, right?

29:41.571 --> 29:42.572
It wasn’t easy.

29:42.655 --> 29:45.283
I mean when they let you visit,
you had to pretend to be a nephew.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.076
(CHUCKLES) There you were,

29:47.160 --> 29:49.162
around your mom,
but you can’t even call her that.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.790
Yeah, it sucked big time.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.125
Cindy, she must seem
like the golden child,

29:54.209 --> 29:56.211
what with your mom and Gerald
doting on her.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.214
But you didn’t have
any resentment toward Cindy?

30:00.673 --> 30:01.800
We got along great.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.428
We went through her room today.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.097
Your mom and Gerald
kept it intact all these years.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.933
Would you put that out?
It’s bothering me.

30:12.894 --> 30:15.396
If you and Cindy got along so great,

30:16.523 --> 30:19.275
why did she take a pen
and scrape your face

30:19.359 --> 30:21.069
out of every picture that you were in?

30:21.444 --> 30:22.529
Hmm?

30:26.199 --> 30:27.826
I don’t know, maybe I did something
to piss her off.

30:27.951 --> 30:31.371
All right, let’s start being honest
about your relationship with Cindy, okay?

30:31.454 --> 30:32.580
I didn’t kill her.

30:32.664 --> 30:37.252
You know, Sam, when Cindy
was strangled and raped,

30:38.002 --> 30:39.963
semen was found on her clothing.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.049
Semen from her attacker.

30:43.633 --> 30:48.096
So when we bring this down to the lab,
and have them take your DNA off of it.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.430
What are they gonna find?

30:49.514 --> 30:51.766
-I’m not giving you permission to do that.
-It’s too late, Sam.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.309
Whoever did this,

30:54.102 --> 30:57.397
not only did they rape
and kill a 12-year-old girl,

30:57.647 --> 31:01.317
But then they sat back and let
an innocent man go to jail for life.

31:02.151 --> 31:03.236
I was there.

31:03.736 --> 31:06.531
I helped put that guy away.
His name is Leonard Peeler.

31:07.073 --> 31:09.951
And that is something I’m gonna
have to live with for the rest of my life.

31:10.034 --> 31:13.872
But I will not live with Cindy Clifton’s
murderer being out there.

31:13.997 --> 31:17.959
I will move whatever mountain I need to
in order to get who did it.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.712
And if it was you, Sam,
believe me, if it was you,

31:21.212 --> 31:23.131
you are not strong enough to hold me back.

31:28.761 --> 31:31.431
Yeah, that weekend, like,
a couple days before she was killed,

31:32.015 --> 31:33.182
we played doctor.

31:33.516 --> 31:35.810
You’re a 16-year-old playing doctor?

31:37.145 --> 31:39.105
-You raped her.
-No, it wasn’t rape.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.523
But you had sex with her?

31:42.692 --> 31:44.444
-Did she threaten to tell your mom?
-No.

31:44.652 --> 31:45.945
No, because I asked her not to,
and she knew

31:46.029 --> 31:47.864
what I’d been through
and how they had treated me.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.575
-ANDY: You were jealous of Cindy.
-No.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.577
No.

31:52.660 --> 31:55.663
If you killed her, Sam,
you need to tell us now!

31:55.747 --> 31:57.248
I swear to God, I didn’t do that.

31:57.373 --> 31:59.208
If your DNA matches, it’s over.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.669
I didn’t kill Cindy.

32:04.631 --> 32:08.176
I loved her.
She was the only one that accepted me.

32:12.305 --> 32:13.640
(DOOR SLAMS)

32:28.029 --> 32:29.781
Yeah, as soon as possible, huh? Thanks.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.701
The dad and the uncle’s DNA
came back negative.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.580
-Sam Jeffers?
-They’re working on it now.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.461
You were trying to reach
Dr. Devlin at her work?

32:43.544 --> 32:44.629
Yeah, she call back?

32:44.754 --> 32:46.464
A gentleman from administration did.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.883
-Apparently, she no longer works there.
-Since when?

32:49.217 --> 32:50.301
He didn’t say.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.805
-Is she working at another hospital?
-He wouldn’t get into any specifics.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.599
-I’m sorry.
-All right, thanks.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.353
-(SIGHS) Thanks, Lisa.
-Sure.

33:01.479 --> 33:04.649
-Hi, Donna.
-My name’s Detective Ortiz.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.275
This is my partner, Detective Ronson.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.570
-We’re sorry to hear about your husband.
-Thank you.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.490
We requested to speak with you

33:12.573 --> 33:14.826
because in discussing the case
with the other detectives,

33:15.535 --> 33:17.829
it seemed like this case
was getting a very male slant.

33:18.162 --> 33:19.163
What do you mean?

33:19.247 --> 33:20.790
They found the tape
in your husband’s apartment.

33:20.915 --> 33:23.042
The tape of you having sex
with Reverend Hawks.

33:23.126 --> 33:27.088
Now, they’ve spoken with Reverend Hawks,
and he’s saying you seduced him,

33:27.171 --> 33:28.673
and that your husband made the tape,

33:28.756 --> 33:30.466
but he didn’t blame Reverend Hawks
of what happened.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.385
That’s when we were, like, "Okay, hold up.

33:32.468 --> 33:34.804
"Let us talk to Donna
and see what’s going on."

33:36.055 --> 33:38.099
Did your husband and Reverend Hawks
get into it over the tape?

33:38.933 --> 33:40.977
I don’t feel comfortable
speaking for Reverend Hawks.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.604
Well, since this is
a murder investigation,

33:44.063 --> 33:46.399
and you and the Reverend
are the main suspects,

33:46.649 --> 33:48.192
you might want to reconsider that.

33:48.317 --> 33:50.653
-Did you seduce the Reverend?
-Let’s start there.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.113
I guess I did.

33:52.196 --> 33:54.782
You guess you did because Reverend Hawks
told you you did?

33:55.366 --> 33:58.077
Satan seduced me, and I, in turn,
seduced Reverend Hawks.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.496
Did Kevin confront you about the tape?

34:03.374 --> 34:08.755
He said he would show it to my family.
And to the courts, unless I gave him,

34:10.339 --> 34:12.467
the apartment
and full custody of our daughter.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.093
Did Kevin confront Reverend Hawks?

34:14.260 --> 34:16.304
I don’t feel comfortable
speaking for Reverend Hawks.

34:16.471 --> 34:19.140
You have a daughter
to think about here, so wake up.

34:21.934 --> 34:24.520
Kevin wanted to take over the church.

34:25.730 --> 34:29.609
He told Reverend Hawks to step down,
or he’d show the tape to everyone.

34:29.776 --> 34:30.943
Did Kevin tell you this?

34:31.069 --> 34:33.488
-Or did Reverend Hawks tell you this?
-Reverend Hawks.

34:33.613 --> 34:35.865
Did Reverend Hawks
talk to you about the tape?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.575
He told me to get the tape.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.578
Did you go to Kevin’s apartment
today to get it?

34:41.537 --> 34:42.914
Was Reverend Hawks with you?

34:44.874 --> 34:48.211
Donna, did you shoot your husband
this morning?

34:50.963 --> 34:54.008
(SNIFFS) I shot the devil.
He wasn’t Kevin anymore.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.636
-Why did you shoot him?
-I had to get the tape,

34:57.845 --> 34:59.097
but Kevin wouldn’t give it to me.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.141
He keeps a gun under the mattress,
so I pulled it out.

35:02.683 --> 35:06.479
I had to get the tape,
but the devil, through Kevin,

35:06.604 --> 35:07.605
was trying to ruin everything.

35:08.022 --> 35:10.316
All right, Donna, and this is important,

35:11.943 --> 35:14.654
did Reverend Hawks tell you
to get the tape no matter what?

35:16.322 --> 35:18.866
Did he know you were gonna shoot Kevin
if you couldn’t find it?

35:19.242 --> 35:20.284
N... no.

35:21.661 --> 35:24.080
All he said was to get the tape.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.415
But when he says to do something...

35:29.919 --> 35:32.964
You understand, based on this,
he’s not complicit in this crime?

35:33.381 --> 35:34.674
You get charged with the whole thing.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.885
He only said to get the tape.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.222
I was the one who decided
to get it no matter what.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.599
To protect the church...

35:45.309 --> 35:46.811
I didn’t know what else to do.

35:47.770 --> 35:50.565

to shove it up his ass.

-So the Reverend wasn’t involved?
-Not in the murder, according to her.

36:15.256 --> 36:16.966
Well, how do we know
she’s not covering for him?

36:17.049 --> 36:19.177
He told her to get the tape,
and she took it from there.

36:19.594 --> 36:20.803
I mean, we’re inclined to believe her,

36:20.887 --> 36:23.139
but you’re welcome to try
bluffing him, if you want.

36:23.222 --> 36:25.766
Give it a shot.
If he doesn’t bite, then kick him.

Donna confessed to the crime,

37:03.763 --> 37:05.765
but we got a little problem here,
Reverend.

37:06.474 --> 37:09.268
She’s saying you told her to get the tape
any way it took.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.104
That’s conspiracy to commit murder.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.650
Donna may be a lot of things,
but she’s not a liar.

37:16.442 --> 37:17.985
I suggested to her that it would be

37:18.110 --> 37:20.738
in everyone’s best interest
if she got that videotape.

37:20.821 --> 37:23.824

to kill for it... never.

You played it just right,
didn’t you, Reverend?

37:29.330 --> 37:31.999
I didn’t play it at all. Can I go now?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.668
Yeah, that’d be a good idea.

37:36.712 --> 37:40.424
You know, that tape is gonna get out.
If not at trial, then it will get leaked.

37:41.008 --> 37:44.303
Accidentally, positively.
It will get leaked.

39:19.982 --> 39:22.651
I lost my temper at work,

39:22.735 --> 39:25.488
-and they found out about my condition.
-There’s other hospitals.

have you, I don’t have anything.

But first thing, we need to find somebody
for you to talk to.

If I go to a hospital,
it will go on my record,

-and they’ll use it against me.
-Jen, you need to get healthy again.

-No.

All right.

I had just made detective when we caught
the Clifton murder, and I...

40:55.244 --> 40:58.497
You know what?
That’s not an excuse. I was there.

40:58.998 --> 41:02.418
But we did have witnesses who lied
up and down the line,

41:02.585 --> 41:03.961
and I don’t feel that’s my fault.

41:04.044 --> 41:08.257
But it is my job to make sure
that the right person gets locked up.

41:08.966 --> 41:10.801
And that didn’t happen in your case.

41:11.093 --> 41:14.221
But, trust me, there was no malice
on anybody’s part back then.

I’m sorry that... you did those 18 years.
