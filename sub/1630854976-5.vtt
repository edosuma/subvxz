It's just...

07:11.530 --> 07:14.160
I made a promise to Marissa

07:14.360 --> 07:17.420
that I would leave Houston.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.840
I started doing makeup.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.480
All the stuff
that Marissa taught me.

07:23.650 --> 07:26.470
And I got a contact
to Drama Queen,

07:26.670 --> 07:29.220
and I, I told her what happened,

07:29.420 --> 07:32.430
and she felt so bad
that she hired me

07:32.630 --> 07:35.560
as an assistant
to her assistant.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.650
And we were in Atlanta
for a little,

07:38.850 --> 07:42.110
and then while she was...

07:42.310 --> 07:45.110
touring I started to do some...

07:45.310 --> 07:47.700
makeup for her friends
from time to time.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.280
And then...

07:50.480 --> 07:53.490
one of them just...

07:53.690 --> 07:56.310
invited me to this party.

07:58.310 --> 08:01.350
And I don't know
whose place it is at first.

08:02.730 --> 08:05.170
And then I run into

08:05.370 --> 08:07.260
Angie Hutton.

08:07.460 --> 08:09.260
Get out!

08:09.460 --> 08:12.010
- Ni'Jah's mom?
- Yes.

08:12.210 --> 08:15.020
And she's so nice.

08:15.220 --> 08:17.270
And she, she...

08:17.470 --> 08:18.770
We just, we hit it off.

08:18.970 --> 08:20.520
She thought I was so funny.

08:20.720 --> 08:21.940

08:22.140 --> 08:24.070
"You remind me
so much of my daughter.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.190
You really need to meet her."

I just, I told her

08:29.310 --> 08:30.870
about what happened
with Marissa.

08:31.060 --> 08:33.330
And-and she just
couldn't believe it.

08:33.530 --> 08:37.580
So then she gives me her number.

08:37.780 --> 08:41.040
And she tells me to call her
the next morning.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.840
So I did.

08:43.030 --> 08:45.000
And she picked up.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.630
And she says,

08:46.830 --> 08:49.690
"Meet me at this really
fancy brunch spot."

08:50.860 --> 08:54.100
And when I get there,
I walk to the table.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.520

09:10.060 --> 09:11.910
and she says...

09:12.110 --> 09:14.200
"There she is."

09:14.400 --> 09:17.370
And she gives me...

09:17.570 --> 09:19.540
a big hug.

09:19.740 --> 09:23.390
And it feels like
the longest hug I ever had.

09:27.020 --> 09:29.220

for hours. [laughs]
