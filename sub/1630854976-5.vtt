00:19.180 --> 00:21.580
<i>Uh, so I heard a secret</i>
<i>a few days ago.</i>

00:21.780 --> 00:23.420
<i>Well, I'm not sure</i>
<i>if it's a secret anymore,</i>

00:23.620 --> 00:24.880
<i>because it was</i>
<i>all over Twitter this morning.</i>

00:25.080 --> 00:26.130
<i>What secret?</i>

00:26.330 --> 00:28.300
<i>Uh, somebody bit</i>

<i>[audience laughing]</i>

00:31.000 --> 00:33.470

00:35.510 --> 00:38.890
<i>[male host] Oh, yeah, yeah,</i>

00:39.090 --> 00:41.810

00:42.010 --> 00:43.900

<i>- Sadly, no.</i>

00:44.100 --> 00:46.110
<i>That makes me feel a lot better</i>

00:46.310 --> 00:47.280
Hey!

00:47.480 --> 00:48.570
- <i>[laughter]</i>
- Oh.

00:48.770 --> 00:50.740
Hello. Can I help you?

00:50.940 --> 00:53.070
Oh. [chuckles]

00:53.270 --> 00:54.990
Looks like someone had
a wild night.

00:55.190 --> 00:56.580
New screen?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.710
The phone.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.370
It stopped working.

01:00.570 --> 01:02.290
Okay, copy that, copy that.

01:02.490 --> 01:03.790
Well, my name is Kenny.
Nice to meet you.

01:03.990 --> 01:05.000
What's your name?

01:05.200 --> 01:06.920
Marissa.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.460
- Oh.
- Jackson.

01:08.660 --> 01:11.070
All right, Marissa Jackson.
Nice to meet you.

01:13.030 --> 01:14.430
Okay.

01:14.630 --> 01:15.850
Now can I see your ID, please?

01:16.050 --> 01:17.390
Left it at home.

01:17.590 --> 01:19.060
Oh, okay, all right.

01:19.260 --> 01:21.640
What about your phone number?

01:21.840 --> 01:24.190
- 713...
- Mm-hmm.

01:24.390 --> 01:26.820
- 082...
- Mm-hmm.

01:27.020 --> 01:27.900
2291.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.650
[typing]

01:29.850 --> 01:31.710
All right.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.470
Now, do you have
the passcode for this account?

01:39.260 --> 01:41.290
You know what, you seem
like you're in a pickle.

01:41.490 --> 01:43.120
So let me help
a sister out, okay?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.270
Just give me a second.

01:46.980 --> 01:48.760
Okay, so it says this number

01:48.950 --> 01:50.420
has been deactivated

01:50.620 --> 01:52.270
by a Harris Jackson?

01:58.610 --> 02:00.020
He-he turned the phone off?

02:00.220 --> 02:01.350
[inhales deeply] Yeah,

02:01.550 --> 02:03.770
and, um, it also says that

02:03.970 --> 02:07.860
this number will be
reassigned in...

02:08.060 --> 02:09.230
- ten days.
- What?!

02:09.430 --> 02:10.400
[gasps]

02:10.600 --> 02:11.780
But this phone belongs to me.

02:11.980 --> 02:13.780
It says right here,
apparently this phone

02:13.980 --> 02:15.990
does not belong to you.

02:16.190 --> 02:18.590
Is Harris Jackson
a relative of yours?

02:25.520 --> 02:28.140
I need this phone to work.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.710
[sighs] Look, family drama.

02:31.910 --> 02:33.800
I get it.
I've been there before.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.990
But I feel like he's the one
that you should be talking to.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.320
Listen.

02:42.870 --> 02:45.600
I need you to turn
this phone back on.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.610
There's... there's, uh,
really important things

02:48.810 --> 02:50.860
on it, really important.

02:51.060 --> 02:52.240
[sighs]

02:52.430 --> 02:54.240
Well, everything is
still on there. You...

02:54.440 --> 02:56.530
I need it to work.

02:56.730 --> 02:59.030
[sighs] Well, I can't.

02:59.230 --> 03:01.330
But I can call
Mr. Jackson for you.

03:01.530 --> 03:03.640
- [slaps]
- Do not call Mr. Jackson.

03:06.350 --> 03:08.000
You know what?

03:08.200 --> 03:10.640
This is feeling
a little bit sketchy.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.470
Mm, mm-mm.
I don't feel right about this.

03:16.670 --> 03:18.720
I'm sorry,
I cannot help you, ma'am.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.220
You can't or you won't?

03:21.420 --> 03:23.430

03:23.630 --> 03:25.810
Ooh. [chuckles]

03:26.010 --> 03:28.480
Wow, this is intense.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.190
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

03:30.390 --> 03:32.330
[whispers] I'm so sorry.

04:02.570 --> 04:05.100
Hold up.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.240

04:08.620 --> 04:10.730
Oh, my God, Dre!

<i>What's that, maybe?</i>

<i>[female host] Fine,</i>

04:40.670 --> 04:42.300
<i>Because who would do that?</i>

04:42.500 --> 04:45.060
<i>Who would bite that gorgeous</i>
<i>woman in the face?</i>

04:45.260 --> 04:46.640
<i>Girl, come on...</i>

04:46.840 --> 04:48.980
Sorry, the line
for the mocha was super long.

04:49.180 --> 04:51.940
But I got you all your favorite
condiments, extra hot sauce.

04:52.140 --> 04:53.770
[chuckles]

04:53.970 --> 04:55.540
So how the hell
you been, girl?

04:56.580 --> 04:57.940
So you work here now?

04:58.140 --> 04:59.860
Yeah.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.910
It's not so bad.

05:02.110 --> 05:03.870
The Sharpstown Mall sucks now,

05:04.070 --> 05:06.390
so the pay's
pretty consistent here.

05:07.970 --> 05:10.040
So how long you been back?

05:10.240 --> 05:11.960
You split so randomly.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.880
I'm just here
for a little while.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.090
And then just got
to take care of something.

05:18.290 --> 05:20.010
Where'd you go?

05:20.210 --> 05:21.430
A little bit of everywhere.

05:21.630 --> 05:23.050

to travel and shit.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.680
You look really good.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.520
Thanks. You look really...
different, too.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.100
Ay, girl, please.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.060
I got chubby.
You can say it.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.320
- I had a baby.
- For real?

05:36.520 --> 05:39.170
Mm-hmm, he's part
of the Alief crew.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.280
Actually, um...

05:42.480 --> 05:44.240
Khalid's older brother Talib.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.280
Khalid had an older brother?

05:46.480 --> 05:47.790
[Erica] Mm-hmm.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.930
We met at the funeral.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.960
We saw you...

05:53.160 --> 05:55.580
um, leave the funeral.

05:55.780 --> 05:57.880
Was everything okay?

05:58.080 --> 05:59.550

05:59.750 --> 06:01.050

06:06.800 --> 06:08.430

06:08.630 --> 06:11.310

because of my schedule,

06:11.510 --> 06:13.810
but my boobs be so mad.

06:23.670 --> 06:26.200
Oh, yeah. I got, um...

06:26.400 --> 06:28.580
I got a tattoo of Marissa.

06:28.780 --> 06:31.050
She loved my girls,
so I thought it was fitting.

06:32.810 --> 06:36.020
I was wildin' for a minute
after she died.

06:37.850 --> 06:40.380
I think everyone
handled it differently.

06:40.580 --> 06:42.590
Like, I guess, you had to leave.

06:42.790 --> 06:44.470
Yeah.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.220
Seriously.

06:46.420 --> 06:47.890
What have you been up to?

06:48.090 --> 06:49.430
Coming back, looking

06:49.630 --> 06:50.970
all stylish and shit.
Where you been?

06:51.170 --> 06:52.850
I was traveling,
now I'm settled in L.A.

06:53.050 --> 06:54.980
Ooh-la-la. Fancy.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.620
- What you doing there?
- This and that.

06:59.870 --> 07:01.190
It's all good.

07:01.390 --> 07:03.210
You don't have to say.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.330
It's just...

07:11.530 --> 07:14.160
I made a promise to Marissa

07:14.360 --> 07:17.420
that I would leave Houston.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.840
I started doing makeup.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.480
All the stuff
that Marissa taught me.

07:23.650 --> 07:26.470
And I got a contact
to Drama Queen,

07:26.670 --> 07:29.220
and I, I told her what happened,

07:29.420 --> 07:32.430
and she felt so bad
that she hired me

07:32.630 --> 07:35.560
as an assistant
to her assistant.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.650
And we were in Atlanta
for a little,

07:38.850 --> 07:42.110
and then while she was...

07:42.310 --> 07:45.110
touring I started to do some...

07:45.310 --> 07:47.700
makeup for her friends
from time to time.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.280
And then...

07:50.480 --> 07:53.490
one of them just...

07:53.690 --> 07:56.310
invited me to this party.

07:58.310 --> 08:01.350
And I don't know
whose place it is at first.

08:02.730 --> 08:05.170
And then I run into

08:05.370 --> 08:07.260
Angie Hutton.

08:07.460 --> 08:09.260
Get out!

08:09.460 --> 08:12.010
- Ni'Jah's mom?
- Yes.

08:12.210 --> 08:15.020
And she's so nice.

08:15.220 --> 08:17.270
And she, she...

08:17.470 --> 08:18.770
We just, we hit it off.

08:18.970 --> 08:20.520
She thought I was so funny.

08:20.720 --> 08:21.940
And she just kept saying,

08:22.140 --> 08:24.070
"You remind me
so much of my daughter.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.190
You really need to meet her."

08:26.390 --> 08:29.110
And I, you know,
I just, I told her

08:29.310 --> 08:30.870
about what happened
with Marissa.

08:31.060 --> 08:33.330
And-and she just
couldn't believe it.

08:33.530 --> 08:37.580
So then she gives me her number.

08:37.780 --> 08:41.040
And she tells me to call her
the next morning.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.840
So I did.

08:43.030 --> 08:45.000
And she picked up.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.630
And she says,

08:46.830 --> 08:49.690
"Meet me at this really
fancy brunch spot."

08:50.860 --> 08:54.100
And when I get there,
I walk to the table.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.520
And it's Ni'Jah.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.520
[exhales]

08:58.720 --> 09:00.440
It's Ni'Jah.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.580
And she's glowing.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.670
She's glowing and I can feel it.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.860
And she turns around,

09:10.060 --> 09:11.910
and she says...

09:12.110 --> 09:14.200
"There she is."

09:14.400 --> 09:17.370
And she gives me...

09:17.570 --> 09:19.540
a big hug.

09:19.740 --> 09:23.390
And it feels like
the longest hug I ever had.

09:27.020 --> 09:29.220
Then she says,

09:29.410 --> 09:31.720
"I feel like I...

09:31.920 --> 09:33.760
I know you.

09:33.960 --> 09:37.200
Like we've always known
each other."

09:38.530 --> 09:41.390
And we just, we talked
for hours. [laughs]

09:41.590 --> 09:44.860
I get there at 11:00 a.m.
and I don't leave until 4:00.

09:45.060 --> 09:48.480
We were laughing and they
kept on bringing mimosas.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.650
- And we just laughed
and laughed.
- [laughs]

09:51.850 --> 09:54.110
Now I've been...

09:54.310 --> 09:57.620

for the past couple months.

09:57.820 --> 10:01.040
Yeah, and, and it's...

10:01.240 --> 10:03.290
it's amazing.

10:03.490 --> 10:05.560
I'm living a dream.

10:09.730 --> 10:11.730
Wow.

10:14.570 --> 10:17.810
You know, I always knew
you were gonna be something.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.020
I was like, "She's so weird,

10:20.220 --> 10:22.410
but she's got something."

10:25.290 --> 10:27.900
Marissa would be
so proud of you.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.460
I know.
