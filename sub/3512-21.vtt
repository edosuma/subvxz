H-o-I-v-l.

01:00.933 --> 01:02.334
Hoilv.

01:02.368 --> 01:05.102
Vlohi.

01:05.137 --> 01:08.039
Hovil. No.
That's not a word, either.

01:08.073 --> 01:09.340
Did you seriously stay up

01:09.374 --> 01:11.442
staring at this scrabble board all night

01:11.476 --> 01:12.676
instead of going to bed?

01:12.711 --> 01:14.145
With these five remaining tiles,

01:14.179 --> 01:17.781
I have to craft a word scoring 9 points

01:17.816 --> 01:19.817
and I turn defeat into victory.

01:19.852 --> 01:21.685
Oh, my gosh.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.155
Did you really beat dad at scrabble?

01:24.189 --> 01:26.724
I concede nothing,
except that I need more coffee.

01:26.758 --> 01:29.192
That is quite an accomplishment,
young lady.

01:29.227 --> 01:30.527
Nobody beats him... ever.

01:30.562 --> 01:33.063
Oh, yeah. He's mentioned that...
repeatedly.

01:33.097 --> 01:37.000
Ahh, how the mighty have fallen. Mm.

01:37.034 --> 01:39.002
"Richard Castle. One word short."

01:39.036 --> 01:41.171
I cannot allow this to be my epitaph.

01:41.205 --> 01:42.839
I saw that.

01:42.874 --> 01:44.374
Hmm?

01:44.408 --> 01:45.842
Beckett.

01:47.611 --> 01:49.579
Okay, I'll admit defeat... thanks.

01:49.613 --> 01:51.014
Because I love you.

01:51.048 --> 01:53.449
You're letting me win after I already won.

01:53.484 --> 01:55.618
Under the condition
that we have a rematch tonight.

01:55.652 --> 01:57.854
Oh, wow. Now you're dictating
the terms of surrender.

01:57.889 --> 02:00.390
Take it or leave it, please.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.457
Hey.

02:01.492 --> 02:03.225
Hey. So, what happened here?

02:03.260 --> 02:05.294
Well, according to our... witness,

02:05.328 --> 02:07.062
our victim, one Logan Moore,

02:07.097 --> 02:09.064
was hauling ass on a skateboard

02:09.098 --> 02:11.100
with a guy on a motorcycle chasing him.

02:11.134 --> 02:12.668
Sounds like a scene
from an action movie.

02:12.703 --> 02:15.070
Yeah, I know, especially
when the biker started shooting

02:15.105 --> 02:17.072
and Logan crashed through
that window right there.

02:17.107 --> 02:19.174
Anything about our victim
that'll explain what happened?

02:19.209 --> 02:20.276
Not yet... just that he's 21,

02:20.310 --> 02:22.077
has a California driver's license.

02:22.112 --> 02:23.712
About all we got at this point.

02:24.814 --> 02:25.948
So, this biker...

02:25.982 --> 02:27.783
was our witness able
to give a description?

02:27.817 --> 02:29.919
Our witness is royally wasted.

02:29.953 --> 02:31.853
All he knows is that sometime
between 3:00 and 4:00,

02:31.888 --> 02:34.122
it was "death race 2000" out here.

02:34.156 --> 02:36.257
The evidence backs him up, too.

02:36.292 --> 02:38.560
CSU found fresh tire tracks
in that dirt over there.

02:38.594 --> 02:40.128
They're making casts as we speak.

02:40.162 --> 02:43.197
So either this is the worst case
of road rage ever

02:43.232 --> 02:45.600
or someone was hell-bent
on killing Logan Moore.

02:45.635 --> 02:47.001
But why?

02:47.036 --> 02:49.737
And why was he out skateboarding
between 3:00 and 4:00 A.M.?

02:49.771 --> 02:52.773
Well, if he needed
some fresh air, he got some...

02:52.808 --> 02:54.775
by way of three holes in his back

02:54.810 --> 02:56.510
from .9mm hollow-points.

02:56.545 --> 02:58.313
So, no eyes on the shooter.

02:58.347 --> 03:00.514
There's no security-cam coverage
in this area.

03:00.549 --> 03:01.749
Our victim's from out of town,

03:01.750 --> 03:03.384
so he had to have been
staying somewhere.

03:03.419 --> 03:05.953
Did you find a hotel key or a receipt?

03:05.987 --> 03:09.256
Well, we did find this key
hung around his neck

03:09.290 --> 03:11.158
and this scrap of paper in his pocket.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.660
It's a West Village address.

03:12.694 --> 03:14.127
You and Esposito check that out.

03:14.162 --> 03:16.229
Castle and I will see what we
can find out about our victim.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.198
Can you just hang on
for one second for me?

03:18.232 --> 03:19.433
Hey, Lanie.

03:19.468 --> 03:21.401
Were you able to schedule
the fitting for your dress?

03:21.436 --> 03:22.735
Absolutely.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.372
And the dress that you
picked out for me is gorgeous.

03:25.406 --> 03:28.408
It's the right mix of elegant and saucy.

03:28.443 --> 03:29.909
Well, I had to do right
by my maid of honor.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.846
Okay, I got to go. I'll see you.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.514
All right.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.915
Hey, Lanie.

03:35.950 --> 03:36.783
Hey.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.984
So, did we hear right?

03:38.018 --> 03:39.853
Are you Beckett's maid of honor?

03:39.887 --> 03:41.454
Yeah, she asked me the other day.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.122
Do you have any idea
who Castle's best man is?

03:43.156 --> 03:45.592
First, "congratulations, Lanie."

03:45.626 --> 03:47.126
Oh! Thank you!

03:47.160 --> 03:50.096
Second, I don't know
if he's picked anyone yet.

03:50.130 --> 03:53.265
You... really think it's one of you?

03:53.300 --> 03:56.002
You two.

04:01.841 --> 04:02.908
Reality of it is,

04:02.942 --> 04:04.610
is that Castle's friends
with famous people,

04:04.644 --> 04:06.312
like James Patterson and Stephen King.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.679
Who?

04:07.714 --> 04:10.194
Come on, man... you really think
Castle wants one of those guys

04:10.217 --> 04:11.884
standing beside him
when he ties the knot?

04:11.918 --> 04:13.218
You know, maybe you're right.

04:13.252 --> 04:14.920
Castle's spent practically
every day in the precinct

04:14.954 --> 04:16.154
for the past few years.

04:16.188 --> 04:17.723
Why wouldn't he ask one of us
to be his best man?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.457
Why wouldn't he pick <i>me</i>
to be his best man,

04:19.492 --> 04:20.492
is what you mean.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.260
Oh, Javi. I'm the obvious choice.

04:22.294 --> 04:24.295
If you can't see it,
I can't explain it to you.

04:26.699 --> 04:27.665
Yes?

04:27.699 --> 04:28.766
NYPD.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.871
Me and Logan hung out
when I lived in L.A.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.474
I really liked him.

04:36.509 --> 04:37.942
Was he staying with you, Holly?

04:37.976 --> 04:41.046
Is this a key to your apartment?

04:41.080 --> 04:42.113
No.

04:42.148 --> 04:44.715
I... I don't know where he was crashing.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.517
Well, did he stop by?

04:46.552 --> 04:48.352
'Cause your address was in his pocket.

04:48.386 --> 04:49.921
Yeah, he did, but it was weird.

04:49.955 --> 04:53.390
Logan called last week out of the blue.

04:53.425 --> 04:55.392
He was flying into town, and he asked

04:55.427 --> 04:57.394
if he can have a small box shipped here.

04:57.429 --> 05:00.130
Well, if it was small, why didn't he
just take it with him on the plane?

05:00.165 --> 05:01.898
He didn't want to deal with TSA

05:01.933 --> 05:03.967
because he said they always
gave him a hard time.

05:04.001 --> 05:05.035
What was in the box?

05:05.070 --> 05:08.338
Um, his... skateboard tools and stuff.

05:08.373 --> 05:10.740
At least, that's what he said.

05:10.775 --> 05:11.908
But you didn't believe him.

05:11.943 --> 05:13.577
It's just, when he came to get it,

05:13.611 --> 05:14.778
he acted kind of strange.

05:14.812 --> 05:16.746
He noticed some tape
had come loose on the box,

05:16.781 --> 05:19.683
and... he freaked out.

05:19.717 --> 05:21.217
He made me swear I hadn't opened it.

05:21.251 --> 05:23.219
Holly, do you have any idea
what was in that box?

05:23.253 --> 05:25.288
I don't know.

05:25.322 --> 05:26.590
I... I really don't.

05:26.624 --> 05:28.858
Do you know why he flew
into town in the first place?

05:28.893 --> 05:29.759
For the games.

05:29.794 --> 05:30.760
What games?

05:30.795 --> 05:32.629
Logan was a pro skateboarder.

05:32.663 --> 05:35.531
He was here for the New York
Street Sports Festival,

05:35.566 --> 05:36.865
down by Chelsea piers.

05:40.604 --> 05:44.006
Okay, so, the Street Sports
Festival kicked off yesterday.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.174
Logan Moore was entered

05:45.209 --> 05:47.776
into the street-style
skateboarding event

05:47.811 --> 05:49.512
and favored to win.

05:49.546 --> 05:51.480
His star was on the rise.

05:51.514 --> 05:53.816
It's all the more impressive
given his humble origins.

05:53.850 --> 05:55.718
Logan's bio says
he was born in the Bronx.

05:55.752 --> 05:58.887
He bounced around foster care
after his mother went to prison.

05:58.922 --> 06:00.155
Then he ran off to California,
made his mark as a skater,

06:00.189 --> 06:01.256
and never looked back.

06:01.290 --> 06:03.692
And then he was killed
by a gun-wielding biker.

06:03.727 --> 06:06.008
Not in the bio, but, obviously,
there's more to the story.

06:06.029 --> 06:09.063
Hey. So, CSU I.D.'d
those tracks at the scene.

06:09.098 --> 06:12.501
They were made by Michelin S12S,
a type of off-road tire.

06:12.535 --> 06:14.536
Why would someone ride
an off-road bike on the streets?

06:14.570 --> 06:16.338
That would just wear the tires
down to nothing.

06:16.372 --> 06:19.073
Unless it's the only type of
bike the killer had access to.

06:19.108 --> 06:21.343
One of the main events
at the games is motocross,

06:21.377 --> 06:22.777
and those are the tires they use.

06:22.811 --> 06:25.013
CSU's checking to see if any of
those are a match to the track.

06:25.047 --> 06:25.880
Okay, good.

06:26.849 --> 06:29.550
So, our killer could be
connected to the games.

06:29.584 --> 06:31.653
Yep. And I'm laying money
it was Manny Castro.

06:31.687 --> 06:33.054
And who is Manny Castro?

06:33.088 --> 06:35.123
A top pro who had beef with Logan.

06:35.157 --> 06:36.791
Six months ago, Logan showed him up

06:36.825 --> 06:38.126
at an event in Los Angeles,

06:38.160 --> 06:39.761
then beat him two more times after that.

06:39.794 --> 06:41.962
Tension got super-high
between the two of them.

06:41.996 --> 06:45.332
Oh. A reigning champion
unable to cope with defeat.

06:45.367 --> 06:46.933
That sounds familiar.

06:46.968 --> 06:49.836
Yeah, but then yesterday,
things got physical.

06:49.871 --> 06:51.805
A fan posted this on YouTube.

06:51.839 --> 06:53.040
<i>Hey! I'm talking to you, Logan!</i>

06:53.074 --> 06:54.441
<i>You think you can</i>
<i>just walk away from me?!</i>

06:54.476 --> 06:56.342
<i>Get off me, man!</i>

06:56.377 --> 06:58.111
<i>Your skating days are done! You're done!</i>

06:58.146 --> 06:59.179
<i>You hear me, Logan?!</i>

06:59.213 --> 07:01.214
- Where's Manny Castro now?
- At the venue.

07:01.248 --> 07:03.950
The street-style event
just ended, and Manny won.

07:21.235 --> 07:23.570
Whoa! Nice tail whip!

07:23.604 --> 07:25.905
Oh. So you know the lingo?

07:25.939 --> 07:28.608
Any extreme sports in your
history I've yet to hear about?

07:28.642 --> 07:30.509
Well, I mean, I think catching killers

07:30.543 --> 07:31.977
is pretty extreme.

07:32.012 --> 07:33.378
And then there's marrying <i>you.</i>

07:33.413 --> 07:35.881
Ah, yes. I admit I am extreme.

07:35.916 --> 07:37.416
Extremely handsome.

07:37.450 --> 07:40.052
Yep... with a high degree of difficulty.

07:41.855 --> 07:43.655
There's Manny.

07:43.690 --> 07:45.324
Big heart for you.

07:45.358 --> 07:46.458
Thanks.

07:46.492 --> 07:47.526
Manny Castro?

07:47.560 --> 07:48.827
Yeah, that's me.

07:48.861 --> 07:51.763
NYPD. We need to talk to you
about Logan Moore.

07:51.797 --> 07:53.998
Guy's a loser.
What's there to talk about?

07:55.535 --> 07:57.669
How about his murder?

07:59.939 --> 08:01.540
When Logan didn't show up for the event,

08:01.541 --> 08:02.741
I... I didn't know what to think,

08:02.775 --> 08:04.175
but I sure as hell didn't kill him.

08:04.210 --> 08:06.510
Manny, you repeatedly swore
to do just that

08:06.545 --> 08:08.213
after he beat you in L.A.

08:08.247 --> 08:10.514
And in Austin. And Tampa.

08:10.549 --> 08:12.516
I talk a lot of trash.
The fans go nuts for it.

08:12.551 --> 08:13.752
It's all part of the show.

08:13.786 --> 08:15.353
We talked to the front desk
at your hotel.

08:15.387 --> 08:17.122
They say that you left
at 10:00 P.M. last night

08:17.156 --> 08:18.717
and you didn't come back until 5:00 A.M.

08:18.724 --> 08:19.857
I hooked up with a girl.

08:19.891 --> 08:21.191
She'll tell you
I was with her all night.

08:21.226 --> 08:22.526
Yeah, I'm sure she will.

08:22.561 --> 08:25.229
But that video of you
threatening Logan yesterday,

08:25.264 --> 08:27.298
that's gonna be a lot harder
to explain away.

08:27.332 --> 08:28.966
No. That's not what it looks like.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.869
Really? 'Cause it looks like
it <i>is</i> what it looks like.

08:31.903 --> 08:34.272
Listen, right before that video
was taken, I caught Logan

08:34.306 --> 08:36.539
ransacking the festival
mobile office, all right?

08:36.573 --> 08:38.107
Ransacking as in trashing?

08:38.143 --> 08:40.144
It was more like
he was looking for something.

08:40.178 --> 08:42.379
- Like what?
- I don't know.

08:42.413 --> 08:44.314
And he wouldn't explain himself,
so I got up in his face.

08:44.348 --> 08:45.916
That's what was on the videotape.

08:45.950 --> 08:47.317
You report it?

08:47.351 --> 08:49.352
I was gonna tell Tom Fulton,
the festival C.E.O.,

08:49.387 --> 08:51.521
but he begged me not to,
so I kept my mouth shut.

08:51.555 --> 08:53.222
And why would you do that for him?

08:53.257 --> 08:54.691
Logan asked me for 24 hours.

08:54.725 --> 08:56.793
He swore it was
a matter of life and death.

08:58.629 --> 09:00.463
I guess he was right.

09:03.601 --> 09:08.601

Uh, we're looking for Tommy Fulton.

09:30.243 --> 09:31.810
That's me.

09:31.845 --> 09:33.946
News just broke Logan Moore was killed.

09:33.980 --> 09:35.047
I'm sick about it.

09:35.081 --> 09:37.315
You... you here about that
or the break-in.

09:37.350 --> 09:38.516
Both, actually.

09:38.551 --> 09:40.518
When was the last time you saw Logan?

09:40.553 --> 09:43.255
Two days ago. He was here
doing some practice runs.

09:43.289 --> 09:44.756
Did he have any issues with anyone here

09:44.790 --> 09:46.258
or trouble with anyone on the circuit?

09:46.292 --> 09:48.092
Oh, the guys play to win,

09:48.127 --> 09:50.061
but it stays out in the park, you know?

09:50.095 --> 09:51.929
So, what was taken from here?

09:51.964 --> 09:54.566
Uh, so far, the only thing
I know missing for sure

09:54.600 --> 09:56.100
i... is my gun.

09:56.135 --> 09:59.203
I kept a .45 in my desk...
legally registered.

09:59.238 --> 10:00.838
Did Logan know about the gun?

10:00.873 --> 10:03.207
What... you think Logan broke in here?

10:03.242 --> 10:04.909
I'm assuming that would have
been out of character?

10:04.943 --> 10:07.779
Hell yes. He was on his way
to becoming the next Tony Hawk.

10:07.813 --> 10:11.482
Is there any reason that Logan
would have needed a gun?

10:12.917 --> 10:14.151
Look...

10:14.185 --> 10:16.487
I know Logan. He had
a tough go of things growing up.

10:16.521 --> 10:19.222
It wouldn't be the first time
a kid like that

10:19.257 --> 10:20.624
fell in with a bad crowd.

10:20.659 --> 10:21.725
What bad crowd?

10:21.760 --> 10:23.761
When Logan first came here to register,

10:23.795 --> 10:25.862
I remember
he gets this weird phone call.

10:25.897 --> 10:28.398
He answers and he says,
"you got some nerve"

10:28.432 --> 10:30.867
"asking me to do this
after all these years."

10:30.902 --> 10:34.737
"Stay the hell out of my life.
Don't ever call me again."

10:34.772 --> 10:35.972
Then he hung up.

10:36.007 --> 10:38.141
Any idea who he was talking to?

10:38.176 --> 10:39.142
No.

10:39.177 --> 10:42.445
But he was pretty shook up.

10:42.479 --> 10:45.981
If he took my gun
and someone killed him,

10:46.016 --> 10:47.283
maybe there's a connection.

10:48.819 --> 10:50.219
- Okay, thanks.
- Hey.

10:51.355 --> 10:53.456
Hey. So, Manny Castro's alibi checks.

10:53.490 --> 10:55.558
And I talked to Logan's competition.

10:55.592 --> 10:57.360
None of them remember anything

10:57.394 --> 10:59.595
about him hanging out with a bad crowd.

10:59.630 --> 11:03.732
What if that bad crowd
refers to an evil cabal

11:03.766 --> 11:05.868
that pays extreme athletes
to duel to the death,

11:05.902 --> 11:07.903
all for the benefit
of depraved millionaires?

11:07.938 --> 11:09.271
You mean like the movie "rollerball"?

11:09.306 --> 11:12.308
It would explain the "motorcycle
vs. skateboard" murder.

11:12.342 --> 11:15.010
Or maybe it has something to do
with the Albanian mob.

11:15.045 --> 11:16.245
- What?!
- Yeah.

11:16.279 --> 11:17.912
According to his phone records,

11:17.947 --> 11:20.816
Logan received a dozen calls
from a social club in the Bronx.

11:20.850 --> 11:23.518
The place is run by Albanians
linked to organized crime.

11:23.553 --> 11:26.822
Isn't the Albanian mob infamous
for being crazy-violent?

11:26.856 --> 11:28.990
See if you can find out who was
calling him from that club.

11:29.024 --> 11:30.459
I'm on it.

11:30.493 --> 11:33.027
Oh. Castle, I... I got something for you.

11:33.062 --> 11:34.829
It's that pen you liked.

11:34.864 --> 11:36.030
It's an heirloom.

11:36.065 --> 11:37.932
- What's the occasion?
- There's no occasion.

11:37.967 --> 11:40.001
It's just 'cause we're...
'cause we're bros.

11:40.035 --> 11:41.336
Best bros.

11:41.904 --> 11:43.938
This is fantastic.

11:43.973 --> 11:45.740
No, it's not. It's juvenile.

11:49.979 --> 11:51.479
So...

11:51.513 --> 11:54.382
Logan's financials got us a line
on where he was staying.

11:54.416 --> 11:56.617
All week,
he'd been ordering from Grubhub.

11:56.651 --> 11:57.852
You mean the food service?

11:57.886 --> 12:00.521
Yeah, they were delivering meals
to a loft in Soho.

12:00.555 --> 12:01.955
Whose loft was it?

12:01.990 --> 12:04.124
Some trust-fund kid... likes
to party with the athletes.

12:04.158 --> 12:05.593
Guy named Ross de Koning.

12:10.498 --> 12:11.798
Nice, brother.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.700
It's not really all that hard.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.869
Oh, yeah. Like you could do better?

12:15.904 --> 12:18.872
Um... Hi. Ross de Koning?

12:18.907 --> 12:20.340
Uh, NYPD.

12:20.375 --> 12:21.574
Wow.

12:21.609 --> 12:24.043
I just got to say,
you can come party here anytime.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.478
In fact, swing by tomorrow

12:25.513 --> 12:28.381
for my very special 21st birthday bash.

12:28.416 --> 12:30.182
Look, as tempting as that sounds,

12:30.217 --> 12:32.619
um, we actually just need
to ask you a few questions

12:32.653 --> 12:33.753
about Logan Moore.

12:33.788 --> 12:35.922
Oh, yeah. I was so bummed
by what happened.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.090
I understand
that he had been staying here.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.326
Oh, yeah. I mean,
we used to skate together.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.895
So when he asked to crash,
I was like, "absolutely."

12:42.930 --> 12:45.564
And did you see him
when he left last night?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.099
No. I don't keep tabs.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.767
Before he moved to California,

12:48.802 --> 12:51.304
did Logan have any connections
to the Albanian mob?

12:52.973 --> 12:54.540
Oh, man.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.275
You think the Albanian killed him?

12:56.310 --> 12:57.409
What Albanian?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.344
That never even entered my mind.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.412
Ross, what Albanian?

13:00.447 --> 13:03.248
So, maybe five, six years ago,

13:03.282 --> 13:06.351
Logan's mom dated this dude... Enver.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.086
He was into drugs
And all kinds of bad stuff.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.589
Was there ever any trouble
between Logan and Enver?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.223
Major trouble.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.959
Logan helped send Enver to prison,

13:13.993 --> 13:15.593
and Enver swore he'd get even

13:15.627 --> 13:17.395
if it was the last thing he'd do.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.134
Enver Kotta...

13:23.169 --> 13:26.237
convictions for armed robbery,
assault, and possession.

13:26.272 --> 13:27.705
According to the case file,

13:27.739 --> 13:29.574
Logan's mom either had the bad sense

13:29.608 --> 13:32.142
to let Enver stash his cocaine
at her apartment

13:32.177 --> 13:34.311
or she was in on
the whole drug operation.

13:34.346 --> 13:35.446
Bottom line is,

13:35.481 --> 13:37.147
Logan got sick of it
and called the cops.

13:37.182 --> 13:39.283
Logan's mom
ended up getting seven years,

13:39.317 --> 13:40.618
while Enver did five.

13:40.652 --> 13:43.253
Let me guess. Enver cut a deal,
threw her under the bus?

13:43.288 --> 13:44.622
Yep. And guess what else.

13:44.656 --> 13:46.590
Enver just got out on parole last month.

13:46.624 --> 13:48.692
So when he realized Logan was in town,

13:48.726 --> 13:50.194
he went looking for payback.

13:50.228 --> 13:51.628
Hey, so, it looks like

13:51.662 --> 13:53.563
Logan definitely had contact
with this guy.

13:53.598 --> 13:55.165
Turns out that Enver was a regular

13:55.200 --> 13:57.167
at that social club
where the calls came from.

13:57.202 --> 13:58.268
Okay. Let's pick him up.

13:59.862 --> 14:02.182
Whatever happened to that kid,
I had nothing to do with it.

14:02.207 --> 14:04.040
You served five years
because of Logan.

14:04.074 --> 14:06.275
It was no secret
that you wanted him to pay.

14:06.310 --> 14:07.711
Is that why you called him?

14:07.745 --> 14:09.913
To let him know
what you were gonna do to him?

14:09.947 --> 14:11.581
I didn't kill Logan.

14:11.616 --> 14:13.950
Then where were you last night
between 3:00 and 4:00 A.M.?

14:15.520 --> 14:17.253
Let me help you out, Enver.

14:17.287 --> 14:20.123
Your credit card puts you
at a diner at 1:15 A.M.,

14:20.157 --> 14:22.291
where a witness saw you with Logan.

14:22.326 --> 14:24.293
That same witness said
that when Logan left,

14:24.328 --> 14:25.928
you followed him out.

14:25.962 --> 14:28.597
A few hours later, Logan was dead.

14:28.632 --> 14:31.501
Okay. I met with him last night.

14:31.535 --> 14:33.503
But I didn't want revenge.

14:33.537 --> 14:35.104
Then what <i>did</i> you want?

14:35.139 --> 14:38.340
Prison changed me.

14:38.374 --> 14:39.975
I found the Lord.

14:40.010 --> 14:43.211
Working my program means making amends

14:43.246 --> 14:44.686
for the things that I've done wrong.

14:44.714 --> 14:46.415
Do you expect us to believe

14:46.449 --> 14:48.784
that you met up with Logan to apologize?

14:48.818 --> 14:50.519
He didn't believe me, either.

14:50.554 --> 14:53.855
So I kept calling him and calling him.

14:53.889 --> 14:56.358
He phoned back yesterday,
said he'd meet me...

14:56.392 --> 14:58.326
if I gave him $3,000.

14:58.361 --> 15:01.329
Why would he want 3 grand?

15:01.364 --> 15:03.165
He just said he needed it.

15:03.199 --> 15:05.300
And if that was the price
to sit down with him,

15:05.334 --> 15:08.203
well... I was willing to pay it.

15:08.237 --> 15:10.705
So I scraped up the cash.

15:10.739 --> 15:12.707
He must have still been afraid of me.

15:12.741 --> 15:14.809
He showed up at the diner with a piece.

15:14.843 --> 15:16.844
I gave him the money,

15:16.879 --> 15:20.347
said how sorry I was
for messing up his life,

15:20.382 --> 15:24.151
told him I'd even testify
on his mama's behalf,

15:24.186 --> 15:26.820
try to get her released early.

15:26.854 --> 15:28.989
And what did the two of you do
afterwards?

15:29.023 --> 15:31.225
He just said
he had to take care of something

15:31.259 --> 15:32.393
before it was too late.

15:32.427 --> 15:34.861
Then he took off.

15:34.896 --> 15:37.831
And I... went home.

15:41.470 --> 15:42.435
- Hey, Castle.
- Hey.

15:42.470 --> 15:44.004
Oh! I, uh, have something for you.

15:44.038 --> 15:45.338
- For me?
- Yeah.

15:45.372 --> 15:47.574
Recipe for Shepherd's pie.

15:47.609 --> 15:49.476
Is this the one Jenny made that night?

15:49.510 --> 15:51.211
That was outstanding.

15:51.245 --> 15:53.080
- You remember you asked how she made it?
- Yeah.

15:53.114 --> 15:56.416
Well, this is her grandma's
secret family recipe...

15:56.450 --> 15:59.419
because I think of you as family.

15:59.453 --> 16:00.420
Thank you, Ryan.

16:00.454 --> 16:02.054
I'm touched.

16:02.089 --> 16:05.091
Always looking out for you, Castle.

16:05.126 --> 16:06.493
Hey.

16:06.527 --> 16:08.294
So, the doorman at Ross' place,
where Logan was staying,

16:08.329 --> 16:09.695
says that Logan came back
to the building

16:09.730 --> 16:11.197
last night at 1:30 A.M.

16:11.232 --> 16:13.600
Which means he returned
to the building <i>after</i> the diner,

16:13.634 --> 16:15.134
and that supports Enver's story.

16:15.168 --> 16:17.036
Yeah, but Logan wasn't done
for the night.

16:17.070 --> 16:18.191
He was picking something up.

16:18.204 --> 16:19.805
Doorman says that he went inside
for a sec,

16:19.840 --> 16:21.373
came back out
carrying a black duffel bag.

16:21.407 --> 16:22.407
A duffel bag?

16:22.442 --> 16:24.110
Could the doorman tell what was inside?

16:24.144 --> 16:26.012
No, but he said it was heavy,
so he offered to hail a cab.

16:26.046 --> 16:27.980
Logan refused and jumped on
his skateboard and rolled away.

16:28.015 --> 16:29.982
There was no duffel bag at the scene.

16:30.017 --> 16:31.183
Maybe the killer took it.

16:31.217 --> 16:32.917
Canvass the area between Ross' building

16:32.952 --> 16:34.186
and our crime scene.

16:34.220 --> 16:37.189
If we can figure out
where Logan was taking that bag,

16:37.223 --> 16:38.990
that should lead us to our killer.

16:39.025 --> 16:40.091
We'll get into it.

16:40.126 --> 16:41.993
You ready to go home?

16:42.028 --> 16:44.129
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
I'm actually kind of tired.

16:44.164 --> 16:47.399
I hope not too tired to... you know.

16:52.171 --> 16:54.906
And "D" for "dyad,"

16:54.940 --> 16:57.508
which means two people talking,
as we are now.

16:57.543 --> 17:00.045
Well, actually,
it's been mostly <i>you</i> talking.

17:00.079 --> 17:01.946
Well, bragging, to be specific.

17:01.981 --> 17:04.315
Okay, word score's a 9,

17:04.348 --> 17:06.784
plus the double word score
brings it to 18,

17:06.818 --> 17:09.019
plus the 5 from the A-Y,

17:09.054 --> 17:10.421
that's a total of 23,

17:10.454 --> 17:13.123
bringing my score to 312,

17:13.157 --> 17:15.693
versus your paltry 175.

17:15.727 --> 17:17.361
Castle, aren't there more
important things than winning?

17:17.396 --> 17:18.529
Ohhh.

17:18.564 --> 17:22.165
That's a notion created
to comfort those who lose.

17:23.467 --> 17:25.769
Well, I was thinking
that we could be doing

17:25.804 --> 17:28.038
something more interesting
with our time.

17:28.073 --> 17:30.074
Well, in that case,

17:30.108 --> 17:32.142
let's hurry up and finish this game.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.443
Okay. How about I concede?

17:33.477 --> 17:35.179
And steal my moment of triumph?

17:35.213 --> 17:37.380
No. It doesn't count
if it's not official.

17:37.415 --> 17:41.050
Now, just take your turn and
feel the bitter sting of defeat.

17:41.085 --> 17:43.052
Fine.

17:58.501 --> 17:59.668
"Quixotic"?

17:59.703 --> 18:01.070
Yeah.

18:01.105 --> 18:04.340
So, that's a triple word score
with the "Q" and the "C,"

18:04.374 --> 18:07.043
plus a double letter score with the "X"

18:07.077 --> 18:09.846
and another 50-point bonus
for using all of my letters.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.680
How many points is that?

18:13.950 --> 18:16.218
314.

18:17.987 --> 18:19.788
I'm sorry, Castle.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.794
I think I need to be alone.

18:41.865 --> 18:45.034
All right. Keep me posted.
All right. Thanks, Bill.

18:45.068 --> 18:47.102
Hey, man. I've been thinking.

18:47.136 --> 18:49.671
You know, Castle likes us both too much

18:49.705 --> 18:52.074
to have to make the pick for best man.

18:52.108 --> 18:53.775
So we should make the decision <i>for</i> him.

18:53.809 --> 18:55.477
Um...
It's his wedding.

18:55.511 --> 18:57.312
How do you propose we decide for him?

18:57.346 --> 18:59.181
Well...

18:59.215 --> 19:01.516
one of us is gonna have to drop out.

19:01.551 --> 19:03.485
And by "one of us," I mean "you."

19:03.519 --> 19:05.287
Me?

19:05.321 --> 19:06.821
Mm.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.322
Why should it be me?

19:08.356 --> 19:09.624
Because.

19:09.658 --> 19:10.992
You think Richard Castle

19:11.026 --> 19:12.159
wants you planning his bachelor party?

19:12.194 --> 19:13.695
Come on, bro.

19:13.729 --> 19:14.829
Oh, Esposito.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.464
See, being a best man is a lot more

19:16.498 --> 19:18.099
than just preparing the bachelor party.

19:18.133 --> 19:19.500
I'm a family man.

19:19.534 --> 19:21.268
I represent a high moral standing.

19:21.303 --> 19:22.603
Oh, please.

19:22.637 --> 19:23.770
And I photograph better than you.

19:23.805 --> 19:25.038
What?

19:25.073 --> 19:27.808
Let me tell you something...
you're going down.

19:27.842 --> 19:29.643
And just remember
that I gave you an opportunity

19:29.677 --> 19:30.978
to bow out gracefully.

19:31.012 --> 19:32.279
You hear me?

19:32.314 --> 19:34.482
Okay.

19:34.516 --> 19:36.883
Castle. Hey, buddy. How's it going?

19:36.918 --> 19:38.385
Don't ask.

19:38.420 --> 19:41.221
Well, as your close friend,
now I <i>have</i> to ask.

19:41.255 --> 19:42.489
Did she beat you at scrabble again?

19:42.523 --> 19:44.491
Can we just talk about the case, please?

19:44.525 --> 19:45.859
Sure. You bet.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.393
So, the canvass to narrow down

19:47.428 --> 19:49.863
where Logan went with his duffel
last night came up empty.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.633
But, uh, you remember the key
that we found on him?

19:52.667 --> 19:54.635
Well, CSU, they traced it back
to a 24-hour gym,

19:54.669 --> 19:56.202
and it turns out that Logan was there

19:56.237 --> 19:58.704
between 3:00 and 4:00 A.M.
the night he was murdered.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.174
So the last place he went
before he was killed was a gym.

20:01.208 --> 20:02.242
And he didn't stay long.

20:02.276 --> 20:03.909
His membership card was swiped in

20:03.944 --> 20:06.179
and then swiped right back out
two minutes later.

20:06.213 --> 20:08.281
Just long enough
to drop off a duffel bag.

20:12.452 --> 20:14.086
Yeah, I totally remember Logan.

20:14.121 --> 20:16.188
He was in here every day
on the rock wall,

20:16.222 --> 20:17.523
practicing his climbing.

20:17.557 --> 20:18.658
This is his locker.

20:18.692 --> 20:20.893
Did you see him come in two nights ago?

20:20.927 --> 20:23.328
I wasn't on duty,
but we have security video.

20:23.363 --> 20:24.830
I'm sure I can get you a copy.

20:24.865 --> 20:26.298
Castle, it's here.

20:31.404 --> 20:32.737
Look at this.

20:32.772 --> 20:34.439
Climbing gear?

20:34.474 --> 20:36.475
Yeah.

20:36.509 --> 20:38.710
And a .45.

20:39.579 --> 20:44.082
This must be the one that
Logan stole from Tommy Fulton.

20:44.116 --> 20:48.619
But why would he need a gun
and climbing ropes that night?

20:49.354 --> 20:51.556
Screwdrivers, wrenches.

20:51.590 --> 20:52.911
And that would be a glass cutter.

20:54.727 --> 20:56.360
And tension tools...

20:56.395 --> 20:57.962
For picking locks.

20:57.997 --> 21:01.765
So, Logan Moore wasn't just
a champion skateboarder.

21:01.800 --> 21:02.900
He was a thief.

21:08.740 --> 21:11.442
Logan Moore, child of a broken home

21:11.476 --> 21:14.078
who found solace and salvation
on a skateboard.

21:14.112 --> 21:17.381
But did he use his skills
as an extreme athlete

21:17.416 --> 21:19.149
to become a master thief?

21:19.184 --> 21:22.619
Did our outlaw skater
become an actual outlaw?

21:22.653 --> 21:24.755
If he <i>was</i> a thief,
then what did he steal?

21:24.789 --> 21:26.489
We didn't find anything of value

21:26.524 --> 21:28.158
in his locker or on his body.

21:28.193 --> 21:29.559
Well, maybe the killer took it.

21:29.594 --> 21:30.761
Maybe that's why he targeted Logan.

21:30.795 --> 21:31.929
Hey.

21:31.963 --> 21:33.997
So, while CSU
was processing that gym bag,

21:34.032 --> 21:36.466
they found this receipt inside
from the day he died.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.867
From an electronics store?

21:37.901 --> 21:38.935
Yeah, in Midtown.

21:38.969 --> 21:40.637
The owner there said he remembered Logan

21:40.671 --> 21:43.039
because he asked for a HI8 camcorder.

21:43.073 --> 21:44.974
HI8? That's an outdated format.

21:45.008 --> 21:47.344
Sure is. The one he sold him
was 10 years old.

21:47.378 --> 21:49.679
So, why would he buy
a 10-year-old camcorder?

21:49.714 --> 21:51.748
Maybe he wanted to film his crime?

21:51.782 --> 21:53.916
Why not use a cellphone or a GoPro?

21:53.951 --> 21:57.319
Hey, guys. Come check this out.

21:57.354 --> 21:58.520
Thanks.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.500
So, we ran through
security footage of the gym

22:02.525 --> 22:03.893
to see if anybody was with Logan

22:03.927 --> 22:06.208
when he dropped off the bag
or if anyone followed him out.

22:06.230 --> 22:07.829
Here's what we found.

22:07.864 --> 22:10.898
These photograbs correspond
to the exact time

22:10.932 --> 22:12.734
Logan's card was swiped.

22:14.570 --> 22:16.537
Wait a minute. That's not Logan.

22:16.572 --> 22:17.938
No, but we've seen him before.

22:17.973 --> 22:20.675
Yeah, at Ross de Koning's
penthouse party.

22:20.709 --> 22:22.710
And he's wearing a street sports
tee underneath his hoodie,

22:22.745 --> 22:23.985
so we checked out their website.

22:24.012 --> 22:27.047
His name is Carter Wexland.

22:27.082 --> 22:29.316
He's one of the competitors,
so Logan would have known him.

22:29.350 --> 22:30.517
Pulled his file.

22:30.551 --> 22:32.853
He has a record
for B&Es and grand theft.

22:32.888 --> 22:33.854
And...

22:33.889 --> 22:36.356
he's also a motocross rider.

22:36.391 --> 22:37.624
Just like our killer.

22:50.232 --> 22:52.467
So, I went to the gym. So what?

22:52.501 --> 22:53.767
At 3:40 A.M.

22:53.802 --> 22:55.103
I couldn't sleep.

22:55.137 --> 22:56.204
What's the big deal?

22:56.238 --> 22:57.805
The big deal, Mr. Wexland,

22:57.839 --> 23:00.040
is that you used Logan Moore's I.D. card

23:00.074 --> 23:02.075
when he had just been killed nearby.

23:02.110 --> 23:03.611
Ain't hard to figure out
where you got it.

23:03.645 --> 23:06.647
Yeah. He loaned it to me the day
before so I could work out.

23:06.681 --> 23:07.982
That was a quick workout,

23:08.016 --> 23:10.484
considering you were there
for only two minutes.

23:10.519 --> 23:13.875
<i>You went there</i>
<i>to drop off this duffel bag.</i>

23:13.891 --> 23:15.825
<i>And since Logan was carrying</i>
<i>this exact bag</i>

23:15.860 --> 23:18.762
<i>earlier that night, we know</i>
<i>the two of you crossed paths.</i>

23:18.796 --> 23:21.131
<i>I wish you could see</i>
<i>your face right now.</i>

23:21.165 --> 23:23.699
<i>It's like this neon
sign flashing "I did it!"</i>

23:23.734 --> 23:25.068
How's it going?

23:25.102 --> 23:26.469
They got him on the run.

23:26.503 --> 23:28.104
Hm.

23:28.139 --> 23:31.206
I, uh, thought you could use
a little pick-me-up.

23:31.241 --> 23:32.975
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

23:33.009 --> 23:35.177
That's what friends are for, right?

23:35.211 --> 23:36.945
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.981
Oh, hey, uh, how are
the wedding plans going?

23:39.015 --> 23:40.082
Everything good?

23:40.116 --> 23:42.084
Yeah. Yeah, great.

23:42.118 --> 23:43.886
Great.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.788
Well, if there's anything
I... I can do to help...

23:45.822 --> 23:47.322
you know, literally, symbolically...

23:47.356 --> 23:49.591
just... let me know.

23:50.894 --> 23:51.960
I will.

23:51.995 --> 23:53.428
Yeah.

24:09.845 --> 24:11.179
<i>So, what happened, bro?</i>

24:11.213 --> 24:12.614
<i>The two of you did a job together?</i>

24:12.648 --> 24:14.015
<i>And you had a falling-out,</i>

24:14.049 --> 24:16.184
<i>then you decided you didn't</i>
<i>want to share the score?</i>

24:16.218 --> 24:17.786
Dude, I'm telling you...
I didn't kill anyone.

24:17.820 --> 24:21.088
Come on, Carter. You had
his bag and his I.D. on you.

24:21.123 --> 24:23.057
You were blocks away
from where he was killed,

24:23.091 --> 24:24.792
and you ride a motocross bike.

24:24.827 --> 24:25.960
With your criminal record,

24:25.994 --> 24:27.661
this is gonna be a slam dunk
for the D.A.

24:27.696 --> 24:29.030
No, no. I'm telling you.

24:29.064 --> 24:31.632
The last time I saw Logan
that night, he was still alive.

24:31.666 --> 24:32.946
So you admit to having seen him.

24:34.303 --> 24:35.269
Yes.

24:35.304 --> 24:37.137
Okay.

24:37.171 --> 24:39.773
He heard about my past
and hired me for a job.

24:39.808 --> 24:41.442
Okay. So, what was the job?

24:43.411 --> 24:45.479
A B&E.

24:45.513 --> 24:48.148
He told me he'd give me 3 grand
to bypass an alarm system

24:48.182 --> 24:49.483
and belay him from a rooftop

24:49.517 --> 24:51.685
so that he could get into
a 15th-floor office.

24:51.720 --> 24:52.685
What office?

24:52.720 --> 24:54.787
I don't know. I was on the roof.

24:54.822 --> 24:56.756
He cut in through the window, went in,

24:56.790 --> 24:58.758
and then sent up the gear with the bag.

24:58.792 --> 25:00.293
That was the last I saw him.

25:00.328 --> 25:02.628
The plan was for me
to disappear with the gear

25:02.663 --> 25:04.697
and then stash the bag at the gym.

25:04.732 --> 25:06.366
Did he have a camcorder with him?

25:06.400 --> 25:07.467
Yeah.

25:07.501 --> 25:09.369
I... I mean, there was one in the bag.

25:09.403 --> 25:11.371
But it wasn't there
when he sent it back.

25:11.405 --> 25:13.205
Did he tell you what he was after?

25:13.240 --> 25:14.407
No.

25:14.441 --> 25:17.410
But when I saw all the trouble
that we were going to,

25:17.444 --> 25:20.246
I told Logan I wanted a cut,
not just the 3 grand.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.681
He got really pissed

25:21.715 --> 25:24.183
and said he wasn't some criminal
and this wasn't about money.

25:24.217 --> 25:26.852
It was about making things right
for a friend who died.

25:26.887 --> 25:29.121
He was really intense.

25:29.155 --> 25:30.756
I believed him.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.825
Did Logan tell you who this friend was?

25:35.528 --> 25:37.596
No. He didn't.

25:39.399 --> 25:42.333
Shipping his tools ahead,
hiring an accomplice...

25:42.368 --> 25:44.569
all the while using a
skateboarding event as a cover.

25:44.604 --> 25:46.872
Seems to me the real reason
Logan came back to New York

25:46.906 --> 25:48.206
was to commit this burglary.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.374
Yeah, but what was he stealing,

25:49.409 --> 25:51.710
and how is it related
to this dead friend?

25:51.744 --> 25:54.345
Well, I'll circle back around
to the people who knew Logan,

25:54.380 --> 25:57.482
see if anybody knows of
any breakins or a dead friend.

25:57.517 --> 25:58.816
Oh, and, Castle...

25:58.850 --> 26:00.385
do you want to come with me
down to the skate park?

26:00.419 --> 26:01.819
I thought maybe we could stop by

26:01.853 --> 26:03.788
and get some of those
bacon brownies that you love.

26:03.822 --> 26:05.123
You had me at bacon.

26:05.157 --> 26:07.225
Uh, well, you might want
to hold off on that offer.

26:07.259 --> 26:09.961
That building
that Carter and Logan broke into

26:09.995 --> 26:11.629
was only a few blocks
from where Logan was killed.

26:11.663 --> 26:13.764
Yet I checked the police blotter.

26:13.799 --> 26:15.966
There were no reported break-ins
there that evening.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.501
But based on Carter's description,

26:17.536 --> 26:20.270
I was able to identify
which 15th-floor window

26:20.305 --> 26:21.739
that Logan entered through.

26:21.773 --> 26:24.775
It belongs to a law office
for a Brett Zaretsky, Esquire.

26:24.810 --> 26:27.411
What was Logan doing
breaking into a law office?

26:27.446 --> 26:29.613
You guys should probably go find out.

26:29.648 --> 26:30.888
Yeah. Come on, Castle. Let's go.

26:30.916 --> 26:32.416
Rain check?

26:32.450 --> 26:33.917
Yeah.

26:41.492 --> 26:44.194
Have you noticed anything odd
about Esposito and Ryan lately?

26:44.228 --> 26:45.329
Like what?

26:45.363 --> 26:47.130
They're being nice to me... <i>weird</i> nice.

26:47.165 --> 26:49.265
Well, they probably
just feel sorry for you

26:49.299 --> 26:51.601
after the beatdown I gave you
in scrabble last night.

26:51.635 --> 26:53.903
Gloat all you want.
I <i>will</i> have my revenge.

26:53.938 --> 26:56.539
Okay. Okay. Let's just find
Brett Zaretsky right now.

26:57.641 --> 26:59.275
- New window.
- Mm.

26:59.309 --> 27:01.177
Can I help you?

27:01.211 --> 27:04.080
Yeah. Hi. We're here about the break-in.

27:04.114 --> 27:06.648
Well, I'm afraid
you've been misinformed.

27:06.683 --> 27:10.486
A thief didn't break in through
your window, Mr. Zaretsky?

27:10.520 --> 27:11.587
No.

27:11.621 --> 27:14.156
Well, why is the glass being replaced?

27:14.191 --> 27:16.925
A small mishap with a bird.

27:18.462 --> 27:19.828
A bird?

27:21.364 --> 27:25.534
Mr. Zaretsky, Do you recognize this man?

27:25.568 --> 27:27.369
No. I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't.

27:27.403 --> 27:29.638
Would you mind
if we took a quick look around?

27:29.672 --> 27:31.272
Yeah, we might... be able to help you

27:31.307 --> 27:34.442
assess any of the damage
this bird might have caused.

27:34.477 --> 27:36.311
Yes, I mind.

27:36.345 --> 27:39.180
Mr. Zaretsky, were you
or anyone else here

27:39.215 --> 27:40.548
two nights ago?

27:40.582 --> 27:42.950
Detective, if you want
to question me, get a subpoena.

27:42.985 --> 27:45.753
If you want to come into
these offices, get a warrant.

27:45.787 --> 27:48.189
Until then, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

28:03.292 --> 28:04.525
Look, there's only one reason

28:04.559 --> 28:07.594
that lawyer would stonewall us
and not report a break-in.

28:07.629 --> 28:09.555
He's covering something up.

28:09.594 --> 28:11.996
Shady law firm, mysterious death,

28:12.030 --> 28:14.064
a young man righting wrongs.

28:14.098 --> 28:16.600
Maybe Logan Moore
is like Erin Brockovich,

28:16.635 --> 28:17.868
but with a skateboard

28:17.903 --> 28:19.637
instead of... you know... other assets.

28:19.671 --> 28:21.204
Brains?

28:21.239 --> 28:22.439
- Yes, brains.
- Yeah.

28:22.473 --> 28:25.842
Hey, Ryan, can you look into
Brett Zaretsky's law firm?

28:25.876 --> 28:28.378
Uh, press releases,
court filings, lawsuits.

28:28.413 --> 28:30.680
See if there's anything there
that connects him to Logan.

28:30.714 --> 28:32.015
I'm on it.

28:32.050 --> 28:34.084
Hey, I circled back around
to Tommy, Ross, and Holly.

28:34.118 --> 28:36.319
If any of Logan's friends died,
they don't know about it.

28:36.354 --> 28:37.587
Well, <i>someone</i> must.

28:37.621 --> 28:40.222
Where did you say
that his mom was, again?

28:40.257 --> 28:41.591
Taconic Correctional.

28:41.625 --> 28:43.993
Okay. Let's see
if she can shed some... light.

28:49.066 --> 28:50.667
Guys, I know what you're trying to do,

28:50.701 --> 28:52.535
why you're being so nice to me.

28:52.570 --> 28:54.737
Beckett clued me in.

28:54.772 --> 28:56.738
And, honestly,
It's just making it harder,

28:56.773 --> 28:58.607
so just... act normal.

29:00.544 --> 29:01.777
- Man.
- Man.

29:01.811 --> 29:03.479
He really can't decide between us.

29:03.513 --> 29:04.913
Yeah, but can you blame him?

29:04.948 --> 29:08.617
I mean, poor guy.
He's in a nowin situation.

29:08.651 --> 29:11.720
But... I may have a solution.

29:11.754 --> 29:13.622
Come on.

29:13.656 --> 29:16.424
Okay, let me...
let me get this straight.

29:16.459 --> 29:20.629
You guys want <i>me</i> to decide
who should be Castle's best man?

29:20.663 --> 29:22.530
Yeah. It's perfect.
You're the maid of honor.

29:22.565 --> 29:24.499
So you pick, we let Castle know.
Everybody wins.

29:24.533 --> 29:26.802
Javi, this is ridiculous.
Of course she's gonna pick <i>you.</i>

29:26.836 --> 29:28.870
That's because there's no better
best-man material

29:28.905 --> 29:30.037
than this man right here.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.406
Right, baby?

29:31.440 --> 29:35.176
Javi, do you really think
I'd pick you with our history?

29:36.345 --> 29:37.979
Well, I guess that's settled.

29:38.013 --> 29:41.082
What's settled is, you two are idiots.

29:41.117 --> 29:43.251
I'm not picking either one of you.

29:43.285 --> 29:44.552
You want to know why?

29:44.587 --> 29:47.421
Because I'm not the groom.

29:47.455 --> 29:48.555
Detectives.

29:50.358 --> 29:52.226
She's just mean.

29:52.260 --> 29:55.329
Well... we can't force Castle
to choose between us.

29:56.364 --> 29:57.632
There's got to be another way.

29:57.666 --> 29:59.466
Mm.

30:05.306 --> 30:09.109
Two days ago, the warden told me
my son was dead.

30:09.144 --> 30:11.545
So I'm just waiting
for someone to come along

30:11.579 --> 30:13.480
and tell me that he was wrong...

30:13.515 --> 30:17.117
that there's been some sort of mistake.

30:19.086 --> 30:20.820
We're sorry for your loss.

30:22.356 --> 30:24.490
I lost him a long time ago.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.294
Did Logan ever talk to you
about a friend of his dying?

30:28.328 --> 30:30.930
Maybe under unusual circumstances?

30:30.965 --> 30:32.966
Why?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.535
Because we believe that it might
be related to Logan's murder.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.940
Well, there was Jay.

30:41.975 --> 30:43.242
Who was Jay?

30:43.277 --> 30:45.244
He was a scrawny little kid
from the neighborhood,

30:45.279 --> 30:47.112
a couple years younger than Logan.

30:47.147 --> 30:49.649
He and some of the other kids
in the neighborhood

30:49.683 --> 30:53.919
used to call themselves
"the Bronx skate crew."

30:56.022 --> 30:58.123
None of them... had much of a home life,

30:58.158 --> 31:00.793
so they'd just ride around
on their boards all day long

31:00.827 --> 31:03.796
and... get into places they shouldn't.

31:05.631 --> 31:07.900
But Jay was the one that Logan said

31:07.934 --> 31:09.801
might be even better than <i>he</i> was.

31:09.835 --> 31:11.169
And what happened to Jay?

31:11.204 --> 31:13.238
He was killed in some accident...

31:13.272 --> 31:15.407
I don't know... like six years ago.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.942
Cops never figured out what happened.

31:17.976 --> 31:21.179
Did Logan ever talk
about Jay's death at the time?

31:21.214 --> 31:22.814
Anything out of the ordinary?

31:22.848 --> 31:24.249
No.

31:24.283 --> 31:27.618
I mean, it was the first time
that somebody that he knew died,

31:27.652 --> 31:30.888
so he... he took it hard.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.593
Jay Dixon, age 12.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.729
He died April 27, 2008.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.363
Coroner ruled the death a homicide.

31:39.397 --> 31:40.531
It was never solved.

31:40.565 --> 31:41.632
What happened?

31:41.666 --> 31:43.500
C.O.D. was blunt-force trauma
to the head,

31:43.535 --> 31:45.536
and his body was found
at a construction site.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.770
Any leads on who did it?

31:46.804 --> 31:48.839
No. There were no witnesses,
no suspects.

31:48.873 --> 31:51.208
All in all, it wasn't
much of an investigation.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.443
12-year-old gets killed,

31:52.477 --> 31:54.245
and no one cares enough
to find his murderer.

31:54.279 --> 31:55.246
Logan did.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.380
Finding justice for Jay

31:56.414 --> 31:58.448
seems to be the very reason
he came to New York.

31:58.482 --> 32:00.350
But why now, six years later?

32:00.384 --> 32:02.953
And why did Logan think
he was running out of time?

32:02.987 --> 32:05.588
And what's the connection
to Zaretsky or his law firm?

32:05.623 --> 32:07.357
If there <i>is</i> one, I haven't found it.

32:07.391 --> 32:09.960
He's not named in this file,
and there's no wrongful-death

32:09.994 --> 32:12.195
or other litigation
against the property owners.

32:12.230 --> 32:13.630
Okay, get ahold of Jay's parents.

32:13.631 --> 32:16.198
Let's see if they've been
in contact with Logan recently.

32:16.233 --> 32:18.234
Hey, guys. Check it out.

32:18.269 --> 32:20.270
Search team just found this camcorder

32:20.304 --> 32:21.804
down the block
from where Logan was killed.

32:21.838 --> 32:23.706
A HI8 camcorder.

32:23.741 --> 32:26.476
Yeah. CSU gave it a quick look.

32:26.510 --> 32:28.378
No prints, no cassette tape.

32:28.412 --> 32:29.579
But check it out.

32:30.881 --> 32:32.047
Bullet hole.

32:32.082 --> 32:33.715
So Logan must have had this
on him when he was shot.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.484
Looks like someone tried
to pry open the cassette slot.

32:35.518 --> 32:38.254
Yeah, killer must have wanted
whatever was inside.

32:39.589 --> 32:41.824
I know why Logan bought the camera.

32:41.858 --> 32:43.793
He didn't intend to record something.

32:43.827 --> 32:45.995
He wanted to play an old cassette tape.

32:46.029 --> 32:48.229
You think that's why
he broke into the law offices...

32:48.264 --> 32:49.431
to get a HI8 tape?

32:49.465 --> 32:51.132
Jay was killed six years ago.

32:51.167 --> 32:52.768
If there <i>was</i> evidence of his death,

32:52.802 --> 32:54.903
it's possible it could be
on a format like <i>this.</i>

32:54.937 --> 32:56.772
Yeah, but we still don't have it.

32:56.806 --> 32:57.806
Or do we?

32:57.840 --> 32:58.907
Look.

33:02.345 --> 33:04.478
The tape must have torn
when the killer ripped it out.

33:04.513 --> 33:05.680
And...

33:07.516 --> 33:09.217
Voilà.

33:14.824 --> 33:17.158
So, I was able to digitize
that tape fragment

33:17.193 --> 33:20.195
and recover
about six seconds of footage.

33:20.229 --> 33:23.597
Look at the time stamp...
April 27, 2008.

33:23.632 --> 33:25.366
That's the same date
Jay Dixon was killed.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.802
I think I can improve the resolution.

33:30.639 --> 33:32.272
Is that a construction site?

33:32.307 --> 33:34.508
This could be footage
of Jay Dixon's murder.

33:34.543 --> 33:35.943
Here we go.

33:35.977 --> 33:38.411
<i>You ever tell anyone</i>
<i>what happened to Jay,</i>

33:38.446 --> 33:40.981
<i>you'll be dead, too!</i>

33:41.015 --> 33:44.451
That's Tommy Fulton, C.E.O.
of New York Street Sports.

33:44.485 --> 33:47.721
Looks like six years later,
Tommy made good on that promise.

33:56.897 --> 34:00.224
Six years ago, Logan witnesses
his friend's murder,

34:00.261 --> 34:02.044
and then Tommy threatened to kill Logan

34:02.084 --> 34:03.584
if he ever told what happened to Jay.

34:03.619 --> 34:05.252
After all these years,

34:05.285 --> 34:06.920
Logan couldn't live with the guilt

34:06.955 --> 34:08.723
and came back to expose the truth.

34:08.757 --> 34:09.824
So, the question is,

34:09.858 --> 34:12.359
what was that tape doing
in the law office,

34:12.393 --> 34:14.962
and how is Zaretsky connected
to all of this?

34:14.996 --> 34:16.463
I think I figured that one out.

34:16.498 --> 34:18.498
Who do you suppose
does all the contract work

34:18.533 --> 34:20.167
for the Street Sports Festival?

34:20.201 --> 34:21.435
Brett Zaretsky?

34:21.469 --> 34:22.702
Yeah.

34:22.737 --> 34:25.304
And Zaretsky also represents
Tommy Fulton personally.

34:26.474 --> 34:28.175
I hope you have a good reason

34:28.208 --> 34:30.277
for dragging us down here, detective.

34:30.311 --> 34:32.946
How about... murder?

34:32.980 --> 34:34.047
C... come on.

34:34.081 --> 34:36.415
If this is about Logan,
I... I was at a club

34:36.449 --> 34:39.318
doing promotions
from midnight to 4:00 A.M.

34:39.353 --> 34:42.789
And where were you on April 27, 2008...

34:42.822 --> 34:44.623
when Jay Dixon was killed?

34:48.594 --> 34:50.295
<i>You ever tell anyone</i>
<i>what happened to Jay,</i>

34:50.330 --> 34:52.831
<i>you'll be dead, too!</i>

34:55.580 --> 34:58.380
When I asked you
earlier this morning about Jay Dixon,

34:58.405 --> 35:00.306
you said that you never heard of him.

35:00.340 --> 35:02.608
And that was a lie.

35:02.643 --> 35:05.545
That tape proves nothing
about Logan <i>or</i> Jay's deaths.

35:05.579 --> 35:07.380
I can place you at the scene

35:07.414 --> 35:09.481
of a six-year-old unsolved murder.

35:09.515 --> 35:11.050
I also have circumstantial evidence

35:11.084 --> 35:13.251
that you killed Logan
in order to cover it up.

35:13.286 --> 35:15.721
Now, how much more do you think
a jury is gonna need

35:15.755 --> 35:17.322
in order to connect those dots?

35:17.356 --> 35:18.523
I can explain.

35:18.558 --> 35:20.693
No, don't explain <i>anything, Tommy.</i>

35:20.727 --> 35:22.828
You think you can hide
behind attorney/client privilege

35:22.862 --> 35:25.163
if you conceal evidence
of a child's murder?

35:25.198 --> 35:26.565
I will have you disbarred,

35:26.599 --> 35:29.401
and then you will stand trial
alongside your client.

35:29.435 --> 35:30.915
Maybe you'd like to call your lawyer.

35:32.605 --> 35:34.239
Don't say another word.

35:34.273 --> 35:35.373
Brett, what's the point?

35:35.408 --> 35:37.275
I mean, the whole plan's screwed anyway.

35:37.310 --> 35:38.910
Stop digging our graves.

35:38.944 --> 35:41.913
I'm not going down for murders
that someone else did.

35:41.947 --> 35:44.615
For God's sake, shut your mouth, Tommy.

35:44.649 --> 35:46.684
No. Not this time.

35:46.719 --> 35:49.020
I think you should leave now.

35:49.054 --> 35:50.654
Well, you can't kick me out of here.

35:50.689 --> 35:52.023
This man is my client.

35:53.092 --> 35:54.325
You're fired.

35:56.361 --> 35:57.828
Either you leave on your own

35:57.862 --> 35:59.563
or I will have you forcibly removed.

36:20.651 --> 36:21.785
Tommy.

36:21.819 --> 36:23.720
What happened?

36:25.289 --> 36:28.258
How did Jay die six years ago?

36:30.861 --> 36:33.396
I started out making skateboard videos

36:33.430 --> 36:34.731
with Jay and Logan.

36:34.765 --> 36:37.833
That day, I was taping the two of them

36:37.868 --> 36:40.803
and my friend D.K. doing tre flips.

36:40.837 --> 36:44.440
Little Jay... he was a natural.

36:44.475 --> 36:47.910
But... D.K. couldn't do it.

36:47.944 --> 36:51.313
He was never that good on a board.

36:51.347 --> 36:53.615
Jay...

36:53.650 --> 36:55.818
he had a mouth on him.

36:55.852 --> 36:58.453
And he was rubbing it in D.K.'s face.

37:00.257 --> 37:01.791
D.K. just snapped.

37:01.825 --> 37:06.728
He... grabbed Jay... and...

37:08.431 --> 37:13.268
...he slammed him against this beam...

37:13.303 --> 37:16.070
over and over.

37:18.874 --> 37:21.776
By the time we could pull him off...

37:24.379 --> 37:25.479
...Jay was gone.

37:25.514 --> 37:28.683
And the whole thing was caught on tape.

37:31.187 --> 37:33.154
Logan...

37:33.189 --> 37:37.291
he wanted to tell someone,
but we were all too scared.

37:37.326 --> 37:40.361
D.K. wanted that video.

37:41.697 --> 37:44.031
He had the most to lose.

37:44.065 --> 37:47.034
So...

37:47.068 --> 37:48.336
we cut a deal.

37:48.370 --> 37:50.771
What kind of a deal?

37:54.675 --> 37:56.643
$5 million for the tape.

37:56.677 --> 37:59.913
What kind of kid has $5 million?

37:59.948 --> 38:02.282
D.K. does.

38:02.317 --> 38:04.351
With what he's getting from his family,

38:04.385 --> 38:05.953
it was a drop in the bucket.

38:05.987 --> 38:08.421
That's why you had to
hang on to the tape.

38:08.456 --> 38:10.323
The money was in a trust fund.

38:10.358 --> 38:13.493
D.K. wouldn't have access to it
until his 21st birthday.

38:13.527 --> 38:15.762
And that's why Logan knew
he had to act right away.

38:15.796 --> 38:17.364
You were gonna turn over the tape,

38:17.398 --> 38:20.600
and it was gonna get destroyed,
along with the truth.

38:21.902 --> 38:23.403
Yeah.

38:30.210 --> 38:31.577
Cheers, guys. Drink up.

38:31.611 --> 38:32.778
Happy Birthday to me.

38:37.918 --> 38:40.086
Hey, detectives! Stoked to see you.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.288
Like my new company logo?

38:42.322 --> 38:43.689
Yeah, it's... it's killer.

38:43.723 --> 38:45.758
In fact, Ross de Koning,

38:45.792 --> 38:48.727
you're under arrest
for the murder of Logan Moore.

38:48.762 --> 38:50.596
And the murder of Jay Dixon.

38:50.630 --> 38:53.031
What are you talking about?

38:53.065 --> 38:55.100
Tommy Fulton told us everything.

38:55.134 --> 38:57.603
Sorry to ruin your birthday, D.K.

38:57.637 --> 39:00.071
But look on the bright side...
the good news is, you're 21 now.

39:00.106 --> 39:01.639
You have control of your trust fund,

39:01.673 --> 39:03.875
so you'll have plenty of money
to spend on your defense.

39:03.910 --> 39:06.444
Well, I won't have to, brah,
'cause you got no proof.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.880
I think we will, brah...
after we take a look

39:08.915 --> 39:10.715
at that motocross bike in your garage

39:10.749 --> 39:13.885
and match it to the tire treads
at the crime scene.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.840
We have officers
searching your loft right now.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.255
What are the odds they find
the .9mm you used to kill Logan?

39:23.529 --> 39:24.862
Where you going? Huh?

39:24.897 --> 39:26.363
Unh!

39:30.836 --> 39:34.171
With Tommy's testimony,
the D.A. is confident

39:34.205 --> 39:36.240
that he's gonna get
Ross de Koning convicted

39:36.274 --> 39:37.341
for <i>both</i> murders.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.110
At least Logan succeeded in his quest.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.646
He found justice for his friend.

39:44.249 --> 39:46.483
And to think all this happened

39:46.517 --> 39:50.053
because Ross couldn't bear
being second-best.

39:50.087 --> 39:51.822
So, are you ready for another rematch?

39:51.856 --> 39:53.389
Really?

39:53.424 --> 39:55.258
You would deny me
a chance at redemption?

39:55.292 --> 39:57.761
Well, keep on this path,
there's a <i>lot</i> you'll be denied.

40:02.232 --> 40:03.934
Hey, Castle. You got a minute?

40:03.968 --> 40:06.502
Yeah, we need to have a little man chat.

40:07.771 --> 40:10.139
There... are some... reports
that I have to file.

40:10.174 --> 40:11.540
Yeah.

40:13.110 --> 40:14.844
So, we've been doing a lot of thinking.

40:14.878 --> 40:17.546
And, uh, well, we know
what you're going through.

40:17.581 --> 40:19.048
- You do?
- Yeah.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.450
We know how tough it's been,

40:20.484 --> 40:22.585
so we decided to make it easy for you.

40:22.619 --> 40:23.719
You did?

40:23.753 --> 40:26.655
Yeah. We talked it over.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.323
And now you don't have to choose.

40:28.358 --> 40:29.625
We'll <i>both be your best man.</i>

40:29.659 --> 40:30.826
Co-best men.

40:30.861 --> 40:33.696
And, believe me, we're gonna
do it up right for you.

40:33.730 --> 40:35.130
Best of both worlds, buddy.

40:35.164 --> 40:36.231
Mm-hmm.

40:36.265 --> 40:38.600
Um...

40:38.634 --> 40:42.270
guys, I'm, uh, I'm flattered
and, uh... and honored.

40:42.305 --> 40:43.745
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, you should be.

40:45.141 --> 40:47.675
But... I already decided.

40:47.710 --> 40:49.644
- You made the right choice.
- You're talking about me, right?

40:49.678 --> 40:52.114
- I think we're gonna have a great time.
- 'Cause it's like, we know each other.

40:52.148 --> 40:54.049
- The ideas that I've already come
up with are pretty amazing. - Guys.

40:54.083 --> 40:55.817
- I know the best restaurant.
- Do you like...'Cause I am on the V.I.P...

40:55.851 --> 40:57.218
Guys.

40:58.921 --> 41:00.855
I asked Alexis to be my best man.

41:00.890 --> 41:02.056
Aside from Beckett,

41:02.090 --> 41:04.659
she's the most important person
in my life,

41:04.693 --> 41:05.860
so I...

41:09.164 --> 41:11.465
You <i>will</i> be my groomsmen, though, right?

41:13.402 --> 41:14.801
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah.

41:14.836 --> 41:16.103
- Yeah, I mean, sure.
- I wouldn't miss that day for anything.

41:16.138 --> 41:17.738
- I'll be there. Of course.
- It's gonna be magical.

41:17.772 --> 41:19.006
Great. Thanks.

41:19.041 --> 41:20.007
It's your day.

41:20.042 --> 41:21.175
I didn't see that coming.

41:21.209 --> 41:22.443
I can't believe I gave him my pen.

41:22.477 --> 41:24.378
I can't believe I shared
a family secret recipe.

41:24.413 --> 41:26.647
I can't believe
we just got beat by a girl.

41:26.681 --> 41:28.715
Let's never speak of this again.

41:28.750 --> 41:29.983
Speak of what?

41:34.689 --> 41:36.023
Hey.

41:36.057 --> 41:38.525
So, um...

41:38.560 --> 41:39.626
where's your mom?

41:39.661 --> 41:41.094
Uh, she and Alexis went to dinner

41:41.128 --> 41:42.696
and a midnight sing-along of "Grease."

41:42.730 --> 41:43.697
Why?

41:43.731 --> 41:46.599
'Cause... I'm ready for a rematch.

41:49.403 --> 41:50.470
Why did you do that?

41:50.504 --> 41:52.305
New game.

41:52.339 --> 41:53.706
Poker.

41:55.809 --> 41:57.843
You want to play poker against me?

41:57.878 --> 42:00.080
<i>Strip</i> poker.

42:00.114 --> 42:01.847
I'll deal.

42:09.222 --> 42:10.623
Your bet.

42:10.657 --> 42:13.425
I think I'm gonna go all-in.

42:13.460 --> 42:14.560
Me too.

42:14.595 --> 42:18.630
But... all I have left
to bet with is the shirt.

42:18.664 --> 42:20.966
I'll take that bet.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.401
What do you got?

42:22.435 --> 42:23.468
Who cares?

42:25.288 --> 42:26.768
This is so much better than scrabble.

42:26.790 --> 42:27.623
Yeah!
