WEBVTT

00:08.092 --> 00:10.720
Hey.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.598
Guys, be honest,

00:14.682 --> 00:18.436
is it too early to decide where
we're gonna eat after this?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.479
Arrived
at destination.

00:20.563 --> 00:23.107
Please exit the vehicle.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.484
What about ramen?

00:25.568 --> 00:26.819
You guys like shawarma,
or is it too spicy?

00:26.902 --> 00:28.154
- Shut up.
- Okay.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.790
All right.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.127
Come on.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.429
- What are they?
- Clones.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.139
They're bodies of people
who uploaded.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.766
It's the same thing.

00:56.849 --> 00:59.226
They have to regrow their heads
from stem cells, see?

00:59.310 --> 01:02.188
They're empty until someone
downloads back in.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.189
High-tech shit.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.733
Why would anyone
risk downloading?

01:05.816 --> 01:07.735
I mean, didn't they see
that guy blow up?

01:07.818 --> 01:09.779
It's the master plan
of the one percent.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.238
Spend your life

01:11.322 --> 01:13.449
pillaging the earth, right?

01:13.532 --> 01:16.535
And just when all that karma
catches up with you, upload.

01:16.619 --> 01:18.454
Chill out in Lakeview
for a few decades,

01:18.537 --> 01:20.456
while the scientists
clean up your mess, and then

01:20.539 --> 01:23.000
download, do it all over again

01:23.083 --> 01:24.794
for the rest of time.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.420
So...

01:29.965 --> 01:31.550
I'll get these ones.

01:31.634 --> 01:33.803
You get those ones.

01:37.348 --> 01:39.308
Well, you can't always
tell who they are.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.101
They're assholes.

01:41.185 --> 01:42.978
That's all you need to know.

01:43.062 --> 01:46.398
Okay, s-some of them
might be good guys.

01:46.482 --> 01:47.817
You know, you can't just

01:47.900 --> 01:50.069
- ruin their chance to...
- Be parasites

01:50.152 --> 01:52.112
with private jets
who think planting a tree

01:52.196 --> 01:53.948
in the Amazon
cancels out your crimes?

01:54.031 --> 01:56.867
Oh, savage!

01:56.951 --> 01:58.744
Bath time's over, bitches.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.379
Fuck!

02:08.462 --> 02:10.965
Come on, get up. Get up.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.925
Guys, it's booby-trapped.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.135
- Jesus... Let's go.
- Watch out.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.846
In a few minutes,
this room's gonna smell worse

02:16.929 --> 02:18.889
than Ivan's apartment.

02:18.973 --> 02:20.349
Let's go, let's go.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.940
I'm sorry, Mr....

02:28.023 --> 02:30.484
Jake Paul?

02:44.206 --> 02:46.417
I can't see jack squat.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.502
Where are my goggle thingies?

02:48.586 --> 02:49.795
God,

02:49.879 --> 02:52.923
millennials are so lame.

02:53.007 --> 02:56.886
It's Family Day,
and the new prototypes are here.

02:56.969 --> 03:00.055
Okay, looks good. Just try
not to drop any more of them.

03:00.139 --> 03:01.891
I said I was sorry.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.059
- Congratulations.
- Oh...

03:04.143 --> 03:05.477
Don't be shy.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.897
Baby's first month is free
with the code FAMILYDAY.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.440
Once your free trial is over,
you'll be autocharged monthly.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.816
Diapers and auto-nap
not included.

03:10.900 --> 03:11.984
Horizen Digital Babies
may change

03:12.067 --> 03:13.485
in appearance
and personality over time.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.362
Digital Babies are property
of Horizen Corporation.

03:17.323 --> 03:19.909
- I want one.
- No, no.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.328
You're just
missing your family.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.746
I'm sorry they're not coming.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.457
Maybe your dad just felt guilty

03:26.540 --> 03:28.709
about the whole murdering me
thing, you know?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.544
Maybe.

03:30.628 --> 03:32.254
Yeah, whatevs.

03:32.338 --> 03:34.298
Meet your new brother.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.759
- What should we call him?
- Mom.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.385
This is so weird.

03:38.469 --> 03:41.013
You can hang
with my family today.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.389
- Yeah?
- Sure.

03:42.473 --> 03:43.641
Thanks, babe.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.476
I can't wait to see them.
Everybody here's so old.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.561
Oh, yeah. There's so much
great stuff to do,

03:47.645 --> 03:49.396
they're gonna have the best day.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.274
Your niece knows
how to use a gun, right?

03:52.358 --> 03:53.484
Hmm?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.653
- Oh, who's a baby?
- Uncle Nathan.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.905
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.657
- Oh, Nevaeh. Mom.
- Hi.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.075
- I missed you guys so much.
- Hi.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.201
Oh, my g... Look at you.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.494
- You're so tall.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.536
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:04.620 --> 04:05.621
Mom!

04:05.704 --> 04:07.289
It's okay

04:07.373 --> 04:09.667
if I call you that, right?
Let's hug.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.919
- Oh.
- Sorry for your loss, Ingrid.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.630
Your weird and preventable loss.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.383
You uploaded for a man
you're not even married to.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.929
Sure. You can call me Mom.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.848
Thanks, Mom.
I'm in a better place.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.019
You look really pretty.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.230
That's because I just had
my tongue lengthened.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.691
Thank you so much for noticing.

04:33.774 --> 04:34.984
- Oh.
- Okay.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.735
Maybe roll that thing back up.
Let's, uh,

04:36.819 --> 04:39.405
- get this started, all right?
- Yeah. Woo-hoo!

04:39.488 --> 04:41.281
Family Day is huge,

04:41.365 --> 04:44.618
so make sure that your angels
get superstar results.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.704
Got it.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.330
How do I do that exactly?

04:48.414 --> 04:51.250
You yell at them
with simple words

04:51.333 --> 04:52.793
because they're stupid cows,

04:52.876 --> 04:56.088
and cows respond well
to a good kicking.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.132
Thanks.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.676
Moo.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.597
Is it dangerous?

05:05.681 --> 05:07.433
Uh, no.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.853
Uh, just looks like someone
accidentally put some plant code

05:10.936 --> 05:12.604
into these chairs, and now

05:12.688 --> 05:16.316
they're growing.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.153
You've grown, too, Dylan,
since last time I saw you.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.655
Still a kid, just 20% taller.

05:21.739 --> 05:24.616
I told you, the full adult
update was too expensive.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.993
Whose dick do I have to suck

05:26.076 --> 05:27.578
to get some chest hair
around here?

05:27.661 --> 05:28.746
Dylan.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.581
Although we were hoping

05:30.664 --> 05:32.124
- for a...
- Like a...

05:32.207 --> 05:35.085
a bug finder reward thing.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.920
Sorry, we don't do that,

05:37.004 --> 05:39.214
but I've heard
the archery game's paying out

05:39.298 --> 05:41.133
twice as many credits
as it should.

05:41.216 --> 05:44.053
I'm supposed to fix it, but...

05:44.136 --> 05:46.221
it might take me a while.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.223
Fuck yeah.

05:49.641 --> 05:52.144
Thank you. You're an angel.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.437
Actually,

05:53.520 --> 05:57.649
I'm Redesign and
a maintenance engineer now.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.318
It's a promotion.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.402
- Ready?
- Yup.

06:00.486 --> 06:01.695
Okay.

06:01.779 --> 06:02.905
- What side?
- Left side, left side,

06:02.988 --> 06:04.531
left side, left side. Now.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.576
- Too easy.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.119
To your left.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.746
- Okay. Left, left.
- Left, way left.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.331
- Other left. Ingrid, Ingrid.
- Left, left, left, left, left.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.499
- Look, it's past you.
- What?

06:13.582 --> 06:15.459
- For God's sakes.
- Mom!

06:15.542 --> 06:16.668
Did I get it?

06:22.299 --> 06:23.884
Other left, other left.
Ingrid, it's just gone by you.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.052
Oh, for God's sakes.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.513
- Ingrid. Oh, my God.

06:27.596 --> 06:30.474
You're so good
at everything.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.558
Yeah.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.060
I thought
it was your left.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.728
You said...
I said your left.

06:34.812 --> 06:36.522
Oh, hey, um, I'll be right back.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.398
Just make sure they don't
kill each other, okay?

06:38.482 --> 06:40.150
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.652
- Bye.
- Tinsley!

06:45.948 --> 06:48.408
Shit.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.706
Tins.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.960
Where you off to
in those sweet khakis?

06:58.043 --> 07:01.171
Nathan, it's-it's me. Nora.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.881
That's not funny, Tinsley.

07:02.965 --> 07:06.301
I'm not joking. It's me.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.637
I'm back.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.891
How do I know it's really you?

07:12.975 --> 07:14.726
I think you can tell.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.903
Wow. Um...

07:24.987 --> 07:28.115
I can't believe I'm looking
at you, and it's actually...

07:28.198 --> 07:29.449
it's actually you.

07:33.745 --> 07:36.498
I never thought I'd hear
from you again, Nora.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.626
Yeah. I can tell.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.962
God, lower.

07:44.006 --> 07:47.759
Yeah. Ingrid, um...

07:47.843 --> 07:50.095
got me out of 2Gig, and now...

07:50.179 --> 07:51.638
we're, um...

07:53.182 --> 07:54.558
Can we go somewhere
and talk? It's...

07:54.641 --> 07:56.977
It's none of my business.
You don't have to explain.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.687
- I wanted to tell you...
- But you didn't,

07:58.770 --> 08:00.105
and it's all good.

08:00.189 --> 08:02.482
I'm with someone, too.

08:02.566 --> 08:05.235
Oh. That...

08:05.319 --> 08:06.653
That's great.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.989
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.449
He's-he's cool.

08:10.532 --> 08:11.617
Mm.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.702
He's so, so cool.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.746
And he's

08:15.829 --> 08:18.707
alive, so that's...

08:18.790 --> 08:19.917
convenient.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.377
The best. Yeah. Ingrid...

08:22.461 --> 08:24.421
uh, she...

08:24.504 --> 08:25.797
gave up everything

08:25.881 --> 08:27.633
and uploaded for me,
so that is...

08:29.092 --> 08:31.803
Well, that was, um...

08:31.887 --> 08:33.013
surprising.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.848
- That's great.
- Yeah.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.600
I mean, uh, well,

08:36.683 --> 08:38.977
sorry for your loss.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.729
That's intense.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.606
Well, she's an intense lady.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.274
You know, but, uh,

08:44.358 --> 08:45.734
it's all good,
brother.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.862
That was weird.
I don't know what that was.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.781
- It was so weird.
- I know.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.908
Man, you used to be cool.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.701
What happened
to you, man?

08:58.664 --> 08:59.748
Nora, are you okay?

08:59.831 --> 09:01.291
Look, I really got
to get back to work.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.709
Nathan?

09:02.793 --> 09:04.836
Where's Nathan? Oh.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.756
He's talking
to his little friend.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.508
Nancy, isn't it?

09:09.591 --> 09:11.677
Hi. Lovely to see you again.

09:11.760 --> 09:15.347
What a fun outfit.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.224
I-I work in I.T. now.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.976
I.T.?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.520
No shit, a promotion?
That's awesome.

09:21.603 --> 09:24.523
Well, don't get too excited.
They'll probably fire me soon.

09:24.606 --> 09:25.899
No, they won't.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.361
Hurry up, Nathan.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.572
We have to take Mom
to the memory parlor.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.119
See you later, brother.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.883
Hey. I have a surprise for you.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.719
Meet me by the Grey Zone
at noon.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.680
Uh-oh, high noon.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.640
We gonna have
a shoot-out, cowboy?

09:58.724 --> 10:00.642
That's right, Paco. Yeah.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.853
Then we'll go to
the saloon, you know,

10:02.936 --> 10:06.064
spit into a metal thing...

10:06.148 --> 10:08.442
Oh, not big on westerns, huh?

10:08.525 --> 10:09.651
Uh, no.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.320
I, uh, believe I deserve points

10:11.403 --> 10:13.113
for trying, though.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.573
See you at noon, okay?

10:17.993 --> 10:20.912
Some strange hack is happening
at the tennis courts.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.205
Well, fix it.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.999
Oh, I don't know how.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.128
I'll poke some buttons,
I guess.

10:30.172 --> 10:33.050
I will handle it myself, then.

10:42.768 --> 10:45.187
- God...

10:45.270 --> 10:46.980
Another point for them.
Come on, man.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.565
They're set to Pong 1977.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.942
Their brains are, like,
20 kilobytes.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.236
What is going on here?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.405
I didn't call for you.
We're good.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.784
Uh, take five, Luke.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.285
Good morning, beautiful.

11:00.369 --> 11:02.913
Are you the Prefera
I've heard so much about?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.457
No, I'm Luke's angel.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.167
God, this really is heaven.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.836
Cute, but I've heard it before.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.672
This is Jesse, one of my
best buds from the army.

11:12.756 --> 11:15.008
Ma'am, Luke knew I've
always dreamed of upload,

11:15.092 --> 11:16.885
so he used his
Family Day pass on me.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.512
This place is amazing.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.430
We're gonna eat
a bathtub of tiramisu

11:20.514 --> 11:22.015
after our "teanis" match.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.767
Tennis.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.811
No. Teanis. New game.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.730
Only way to score points is to
hit the other guy in the crotch.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.732
Well, that's stupid.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.776
You're the only one
that can get hurt.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.112
Jesse's balls are safe
in the real world.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.197
Yeah, it makes me feel alive.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.699
You want to play a round, huh?
You can be on Jesse's team.

11:39.783 --> 11:42.494
Yeah... I'm a boss now.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.621
I don't have time
to mess around with you.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.833
Oh, well, if you
were a real boss,

11:47.916 --> 11:50.043
you could decide
how to spend your day.

11:51.586 --> 11:55.048
Well, maybe a round or two.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.931
Oh, you fucker. It's on.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.143
Let's go, Jesse.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.485
Oh, so cute.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.946
Did you know Fendi
designed the spit-up rags

12:18.029 --> 12:19.865
and the spit-up?

12:19.948 --> 12:22.033
These digital babies
creep me out.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.243
Well, I think they're

12:23.326 --> 12:25.704
a very interesting invention.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.247
It's an opportunity for uploads

12:27.330 --> 12:29.875
to experience
the joys of parenthood.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.209
Right, Nathan?

12:31.293 --> 12:34.546
Uh, well, I guess
if you screw them up,

12:34.629 --> 12:36.047
it doesn't really matter, right?

12:36.131 --> 12:38.884
Well, we wouldn't screw them up.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.927
But they're not
real babies, Ingrid.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.762
I know that, Viv.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.764
I know that.

12:54.191 --> 12:56.485
You're supposed to follow her.

12:56.568 --> 12:57.777
Am I?

12:57.861 --> 13:01.448
Yeah. If you see me
walking like that,

13:01.531 --> 13:03.408
- I am big mad.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.286
Oh, no. We don't want
Big Mad Neveah.

13:06.369 --> 13:09.581
- Don't want Big Mad Neveah.

13:09.664 --> 13:12.292
Imagine me a dad. I can barely
take care of myself.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.962
Everybody run.
It's Big Mad Neveah!

13:17.339 --> 13:19.049
- Nice shot.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.134
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Foot fault.

13:21.218 --> 13:23.553
- Second serve.
- Fine.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.766
- Whoa!

13:27.849 --> 13:29.184
- Nice shot there.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.685
Goddamn it.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.855
I am furious at Nathan.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.982
Hm, I notice you often express

13:36.066 --> 13:38.318
your feelings as anger,

13:38.401 --> 13:40.111
but maybe you're really lonely

13:40.195 --> 13:41.404
and sad.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.073
Fuck you, Helen.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.866
I have a right to be pissed off.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.410
I am so clearly committed
to this relationship,

13:47.494 --> 13:50.622
but Nathan won't even consider
a digital baby.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.542
Ingrid Kannerman
wants to be a mom.

13:55.961 --> 13:59.214
Let's look closely at the root
of this baby desire.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.383
Perhaps you want something
of your own

14:01.466 --> 14:04.386
because you worry
that you're unlovable.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.973
Why do you always think
I'm worried I'm unlovable?

14:08.056 --> 14:10.100
I am so much
more lovable than...

14:10.183 --> 14:12.561
than you will ever be.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.020
I mean,
what I really worry about

14:14.104 --> 14:16.189
is how bad
of a therapist you are.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.108
And so then

14:18.191 --> 14:20.318
Shona told Brody

14:20.402 --> 14:22.487
she's sick of him
being rude to her,

14:22.571 --> 14:24.281
and that he's not as funny
as he thinks he is.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.200
Ooh, go off, Shona.
I'm so proud of that girl.

14:27.284 --> 14:28.952
She really learned
to love herself.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.621
Hey, that's Ingrid's dad.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.248
Right?

14:33.331 --> 14:34.708
Wait, what?
Are you sure it was him?

14:34.791 --> 14:37.252
Yeah, I remember him
from my sleepover dinner party.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.587
What is he doing here?

14:38.670 --> 14:40.839
I'm sure there's some
reasonable explanation.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.591
He's here to surprise Ingrid?

14:42.674 --> 14:45.385
- No chance.
- The grandmother?

14:45.468 --> 14:48.471
Maybe. Y-You guys head
to the memory parlor.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.432
- I'll meet you there, okay?
- Okay.

14:50.515 --> 14:51.891
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Nevaeh.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.769
So, the bottle auto-refills
after every use.

14:54.853 --> 14:55.937
You can pay as you go...

14:56.021 --> 14:57.772
Hey, Nathan. It's Tinsley.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.232
- Oh, hey.
- Yeah.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.693
I got my own avatar,
based on me.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.737
Look at you. Great.
Uh, oh, uh...

15:03.820 --> 15:06.531
Sorry. Excuse me.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.575
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Is there somewhere we can go

15:08.658 --> 15:10.869
and talk real quick, in private?

15:10.952 --> 15:13.246
Kannerman is here, in Lakeview.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.456
Well, it's Family Day.

15:14.539 --> 15:15.832
That family hates each other.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.917
What if he's using it as a cover
to meet with someone else?

15:18.001 --> 15:20.337
- You could always ask Ingrid.
- I-I did, okay?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.714
She doesn't know anything
about who's behind my murder.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.716
- I think it might be the Ludds.
- That's impossible.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.469
Why? I mean,
th-they attacked Freeyond.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.554
They-they are against
digital afterlife.

15:29.638 --> 15:32.098
What if they used Kannerman to
get my code, then had me killed?

15:32.182 --> 15:33.642
Look, I'm telling you,
it's not the Ludds.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.353
- How can you be so sure?
- Because...

15:36.436 --> 15:38.730
The guy I'm dating,

15:38.813 --> 15:40.565
Matteo, he's a Ludd.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.651
What? Nora, how could you
be so naive?

15:42.734 --> 15:43.818
The Ludds are crazy.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.654
The Ludds are not crazy.

15:45.737 --> 15:48.323
They sacrifice a lot
for what they believe in.

15:48.406 --> 15:49.407
You know, maybe that's
just not something

15:49.491 --> 15:50.659
you can relate to anymore.

15:50.742 --> 15:51.660
I'm just trying
to protect you...

15:51.743 --> 15:53.036
- Well, I'm good.
- From...

15:53.119 --> 15:54.704
Really.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.873
I trust Matteo.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.000
- Okay.
- He's never lied to me.

16:02.629 --> 16:06.299
Look, I got to go.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.389
If I find out anything
about Kannerman, I'll text you.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.451
- Morning.
- Morning.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.716
Hi.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.217
It's me. It worked.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.515
- Hey, nice to see you.
- Oh.

16:55.598 --> 16:56.808
I-I'm sorry.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.310
I-I-I just, I can't kiss
this face. It's just...

16:59.394 --> 17:01.730
- Oh, God. Yeah. Blegh. Gross.
- ...wrong.

17:01.813 --> 17:02.772
Totally get it.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.190
So, what's my big surprise?

17:04.274 --> 17:05.984
Yes.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.360
- This.
- Thank you so much.

17:07.444 --> 17:08.862
Oh, it's a free diaper bag.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.698
No, close. It's a hyperworm.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.992
We are going to fuck up
Family Day.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.201
All you need to do is

17:15.285 --> 17:17.287
leave it in the lobby,
near the concierge desk.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.123
Matteo, what about
all the people?

17:20.206 --> 17:23.001
Horizen's the enemy,
not... not them.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.252
They're safe at home

17:24.335 --> 17:26.087
in VR suits. You know that.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.756
Okay, not the uploads.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.174
It's debatable,
you consider them people.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.675
This is going to make

17:30.759 --> 17:33.052
a big splash.
The AI system will be infected

17:33.136 --> 17:35.180
with our propaganda message.
It's all worked out.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.140
Right.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.975
- Look, I know, but...
- L... Look.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.810
If you want to pursue justice,
sometimes

17:40.894 --> 17:43.104
you have to make a few
rich people uncomfortable, okay?

17:43.188 --> 17:44.814
Ow. You're gonna... Ah!

17:44.898 --> 17:46.733
What-what is...

17:46.816 --> 17:48.359
Hang on.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.446
Come on.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.531
In my own house? Get off him.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.367
I want to clean him up.
He's a real man.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.832
I'm not encouraging her...
It. I'm not encouraging...

18:05.752 --> 18:07.420
You know, your dad
and Pastor Rob

18:07.504 --> 18:08.630
don't think you can do this.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.215
Your dad thinks
you're too kindhearted,

18:10.298 --> 18:11.466
and Pastor Rob
thinks you're soft.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.926
Okay, I'm not soft.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.178
I know. I know you're committed
to changing things.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.472
Well, this is how you do it.

18:17.555 --> 18:20.308
Okay?
You're the only one

18:20.391 --> 18:22.060
here who could pull this off.

18:22.143 --> 18:23.895
I know you won't disappoint us

18:23.978 --> 18:26.064
'cause I believe in you, Nora.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.289
Oh, give her to me.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.667
Oh. Oopsy-doops. Sorry,
Miss Kannerman, I didn't...

18:45.750 --> 18:47.085
"I'm sorry,
Miss Kannerman,

18:47.168 --> 18:48.586
I didn't see you there."
Just watch where I'm going.

18:48.670 --> 18:49.921
Okay?

18:50.004 --> 18:51.381
Stop staring at me,

18:51.464 --> 18:54.717
you useless, pre-programmed
sack of shit.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.345
Oh... Hey.

19:01.599 --> 19:05.103
You will become human
before that woman ever does.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.617
And there,

20:00.700 --> 20:03.453
dangling from the door handle,

20:03.536 --> 20:05.705
was a bloody hook!

20:07.332 --> 20:09.500
"Attack
of the Hook Man."

20:09.584 --> 20:11.252
Okay, I totally forgot
about this.

20:11.336 --> 20:12.503
I can't believe
I thought it was okay

20:12.587 --> 20:14.005
to tell a six-year-old
that story.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.298
What a dummy.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.342
Why? I liked it.

20:17.425 --> 20:18.718
You were terrified.

20:18.801 --> 20:19.928
- No way.
- Mom?

20:20.011 --> 20:21.971
Oh, your mother
was furious with us.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.265
You slept with the lights on
for an entire week.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.559
No, no, that does not
sound like me.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.156
We are the Ludds.
Save your souls.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.784
Abolish Lakeview.
Delete the rich.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.578
You are under attack
by the Ludd army.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.289
Revolution has come to Horizen.

20:48.373 --> 20:49.666
We are the Ludds.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.335
- Take that!

20:57.090 --> 20:59.300
Revolution has come to Horizen.

20:59.384 --> 21:00.551
Revolution

21:00.635 --> 21:02.553
has come to Horizen.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.514
- The fuck?
- Abolish Lakeview.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.557
Delete the rich.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.393
- Huh?
- The revolution...

21:08.476 --> 21:10.395
Hey, something's going down.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.814
- You think?
- The revolution...

21:12.897 --> 21:15.608
I can't believe I wasted my day
playing your dumb game.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.568
...to Horizen!

21:17.652 --> 21:20.279
Delete the rich.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.576
Oh, you were such a cutie.

21:25.660 --> 21:26.786
- What happened?

21:26.869 --> 21:29.580
Oh, Nathan.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.626
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.670
This has never happened before.
Okay, um...

21:35.753 --> 21:37.255
You guys better go.

21:37.338 --> 21:38.798
- What about you?
- Oh, I'm fine.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.258
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

21:40.341 --> 21:41.718
I want to hear more about
that Brody and Shona drama.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.719
I love you.

21:42.802 --> 21:43.845
About that digital baby thing,

21:43.928 --> 21:45.304
maybe it's not such a bad idea?

21:45.388 --> 21:47.932
Mom, no.
I'm-I'm a fun uncle, okay?

21:48.016 --> 21:49.892
But I'm selfish, I'm immature,

21:49.976 --> 21:52.186
- I lie...
- No, Nathan, you are not

21:52.270 --> 21:53.312
the man you used to be,

21:53.396 --> 21:54.856
and the guy you were

21:54.939 --> 21:57.358
wasn't so bad, either.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.611
Okay. Go. Go, go, go, go.

22:00.695 --> 22:02.572
Bye.

22:06.534 --> 22:09.287
- We're doing our best.

22:09.370 --> 22:12.040
Everyone, stay calm.
You're gonna be okay.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.042
Angels will be on their way
to help you.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.753
My team is working
on the problem.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.337
Save your souls.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.882
Abolish Lakeview.
Delete the rich.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.467
I got this.
I got this!

22:22.550 --> 22:24.677
I-It'll be okay.

22:27.388 --> 22:30.391
How is it replicating so fast?

22:30.475 --> 22:31.976
Hey, guys I-I think
it's the, uh...

22:32.060 --> 22:34.187
Shh. New girl,
we're trying to think.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.572
Oh, hey,
it's working.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.657
- I did it.
- No.

22:46.741 --> 22:48.659
I did.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.209
Uh, the virus was replicating

22:56.292 --> 22:58.044
inside the AI guys, so

22:58.127 --> 22:59.962
now that I've shut them down,

23:00.046 --> 23:02.381
we should be able
to clean up everything else.

23:02.465 --> 23:04.842
How did you work
that out so fast?

23:04.926 --> 23:06.344
I...

23:06.427 --> 23:08.888
I don't know.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.848
Lucky guess.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.409
Where's the motherfucker
that fucked up my day?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.788
Helping some kids who were
freaked out by the virus.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.623
Helping? Or making it worse?

23:35.706 --> 23:37.333
That man is a hazard.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.794
You know, Luke was
my commanding officer,

23:39.877 --> 23:41.963
and he was exceptional.

23:42.046 --> 23:43.548
- What?
- Iran

23:43.631 --> 23:45.758
was the first war
with autonomous drones,

23:45.842 --> 23:47.802
so it was intense,

23:47.885 --> 23:50.179
but Luke never
showed the stress.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.223
He kept morale high
when things were rough.

23:52.306 --> 23:55.101
Always figured out ways
to make us smile or help us out.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.895
That's what got
a lot of us home.

23:57.979 --> 24:01.065
I'm having a hard time
processing this.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.109
We're talking
about the same Luke?

24:03.192 --> 24:05.611
Thanks for today.
It was a pleasure.

24:05.695 --> 24:08.406
Now I know why Luke says
all those nice things about you.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.324
Wait.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.285
Luke says nice things?

24:12.368 --> 24:13.828
About me?

24:13.911 --> 24:15.621
What nice things?

24:15.705 --> 24:18.374
Well, don't leave me hanging.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.839
10,500.

24:24.922 --> 24:26.257
Of course, Miss Kannerman.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.800
I hope you and Mr. Brown
had a magnificent day.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.344
- Would you like to...
- Shut up.

24:31.512 --> 24:34.348
I don't need
a running commentary.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.562
Ma'am?

24:52.742 --> 24:56.746
I try so hard,
and nothing works.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.664
Yeah,
I'm spectacularly beautiful;

24:58.748 --> 25:00.833
Nathan doesn't seem to care.

25:00.917 --> 25:04.420
He's... he's only in love
with me when I'm not me,

25:04.503 --> 25:07.590
and I try to be good to his mom,

25:07.673 --> 25:09.258
but she hates me,

25:09.342 --> 25:12.261
and he takes her side, and...

25:12.345 --> 25:14.513
I think that we're meant
to be together for eternity,

25:14.597 --> 25:16.849
but it is taking forever
to get him there.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.436
I'm...

25:22.355 --> 25:24.899
I'm lovable, right?

25:24.982 --> 25:26.234
Yes.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.445
Miss Kannerman, I love you.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.072
- Hmm.

25:31.155 --> 25:33.991
- Well, this is your floor.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.168
Jesus Christ.

25:54.095 --> 25:55.638
No.

26:09.527 --> 26:10.861
Thank you.

26:13.281 --> 26:15.950
Guys, it's-it's
not really a big deal.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.377
Hey, babe.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.296
You okay?
I was worried about you.

26:28.379 --> 26:30.006
Did you get hit
by a glitch or something?

26:30.089 --> 26:31.590
I saw a man

26:31.674 --> 26:34.260
stuck halfway inside a wall.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.012
Yikes.

26:36.095 --> 26:39.348
Yeah. And then I heard
that floor 11,111

26:39.432 --> 26:42.101
just disappeared.

26:45.479 --> 26:48.065
God...

26:48.149 --> 26:49.692
I'm exhausted.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.194
Yeah, I bet.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.492
You know, um,

26:58.576 --> 27:00.703
I was thinking,

27:00.786 --> 27:03.372
nothing's certain in this life,

27:03.456 --> 27:06.459
even here, and, um,

27:06.542 --> 27:08.919
maybe you aren't crazy

27:09.003 --> 27:10.629
for wanting a digital baby.

27:10.713 --> 27:12.631
Yeah?

27:12.715 --> 27:14.133
Yeah.

27:14.216 --> 27:16.052
Aw, babe.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.139
You know, I think we would make
a really cute kid.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.016
- Yeah.
- With my face

27:22.099 --> 27:24.310
and your hair... Well, your abs.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.603
- Mm-hmm.
- And our hair.

27:25.686 --> 27:28.105
- And, um...
- Yeah. Someday.

27:28.189 --> 27:29.482
Someday soon.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.609
- Someday.
- Soon.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.235
Mm, someday.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.488
Someday soon, someday soon.

27:40.076 --> 27:42.578
Mm... My goodness. Um...

27:42.661 --> 27:44.789
Wh... Is the new tongue
too long?

27:44.872 --> 27:45.915
Uh...

27:45.998 --> 27:47.833
Just-just a little.

27:47.917 --> 27:50.002
Damn it.
