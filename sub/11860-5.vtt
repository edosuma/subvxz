WEBVTT

00:25.208 --> 00:26.750
Farmer's puttin' on a real show.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.250
(male #1)
'He used up his gas
dusting his crops.'

00:33.333 --> 00:37.291
(male #2)
'Rations run out? Coming
to the base for handouts?'

00:40.500 --> 00:42.750
(male #3)
'Oh, man, not another one.'

00:45.917 --> 00:47.417
Bad enough we gotta deal
with 'em at home.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.875
Now they're taking
over the base too?

00:48.959 --> 00:51.000
War's got this whole
country
turned upside-down.

00:56.041 --> 00:58.041
Miss Lynn, I presume.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.417
Reporting for duty, ma'am.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.083
Miss Lynn thinks
she's an HP, ladies.

01:02.166 --> 01:04.458
That right?
Think you're a hot pilot?

01:04.542 --> 01:06.125
Not an HP, ma'am.

01:06.208 --> 01:08.041
A Miss HP.

01:10.041 --> 01:13.417
Army won't tolerate tardiness
or grandstanding.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.792
Neither will I.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.625
You girls have the honor
and privilege

01:17.709 --> 01:21.291
to be of the first women
trained by the Army Air Force.

01:21.375 --> 01:25.041
You may be good pilots, Miss HP

01:25.125 --> 01:28.333
but here, you'll learn
to fly the Army way.

01:31.041 --> 01:32.834
Captain James.

01:32.917 --> 01:37.166
Ladies, you either check out
with me, or you wash out.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.375
Fail your check flights

01:39.458 --> 01:41.583
can't pass ground school

01:41.667 --> 01:43.000
have an attitude

01:43.083 --> 01:45.458
I will wash you out.

01:45.542 --> 01:46.625
Captain.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.500
Hey, can you teach me
to fly like that?

01:51.583 --> 01:55.208
Say, if you're giving out
free lessons, sign me up
too.

01:55.291 --> 01:57.041
Just 'cause cowgirl
can dust a few crops

01:57.125 --> 02:00.458
doesn't mean she can handle
a supercharged V-12 Army plane.

02:00.542 --> 02:04.208
Oh, hell, if it's got wings
and an engine, I can fly it.

02:47.875 --> 02:51.417
Ah, must be hard making ends
meet since PMI canned you.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.500
Detective, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

02:54.583 --> 02:55.917
You here for a loan?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.750
Wonder if the good
people
at Emerson Mutual

02:57.834 --> 03:00.417
know who they're
considering
giving money to.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.625
You're kidding me, right?

03:02.709 --> 03:06.041
Attempted homicide
of a police
officer.

03:06.125 --> 03:07.834
Now, that's got to
hurt your FICO
score.

03:07.917 --> 03:10.959
Cute trick,
putting the boot on my car.

03:11.041 --> 03:12.917
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

03:13.000 --> 03:16.291
Hard time making
those payments from
jail.

03:16.375 --> 03:18.417
You sure you wanna do this?

03:18.500 --> 03:20.750
You'd be surprised
what I can do, Moe.

03:31.625 --> 03:33.792
Alarm clock broke?

03:33.875 --> 03:35.208
Had to go to the bank.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.291
What have we got?

03:38.375 --> 03:39.625
Environmental group's
trying to turn

03:39.709 --> 03:42.959
the reservoir
into a bird sanctuary.

03:43.041 --> 03:45.375
Consultant found
this P-51 Mustang

03:45.458 --> 03:47.333
With
skeletal
remains.

03:47.417 --> 03:48.625
Huh!

03:48.709 --> 03:49.959
Huh, that's some bird.

03:50.041 --> 03:52.125
Mustang was a World War II
combat plane.

03:52.208 --> 03:54.375
My father flew one
in the war.

03:54.458 --> 03:55.417
Who's the pilot?

03:55.500 --> 03:57.792
Vivian...Lynn.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.500
Female pilot in World War II?

03:59.583 --> 04:01.083
Vivian was a member of the WASP.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.375
Women Air force Service Pilots.

04:03.458 --> 04:05.959
Veterans Affairs says one
of 'em went missing in
1944.

04:06.041 --> 04:07.208
Guess we found her.

04:07.291 --> 04:08.625
Thought women pilots
weren't accepted

04:08.709 --> 04:10.625
in the military till the '70s.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.458
WASP weren't military.

04:12.542 --> 04:14.834
They flew as civilians
on non-combat missions.

04:14.917 --> 04:17.166
CSU found
this waterproof rucksack

04:17.250 --> 04:19.500
'stashed in the wing's
bullet compartment.'

04:19.583 --> 04:23.333
What kind of mission
you need a skirt and heels
for?

04:23.417 --> 04:24.792
And no one saw
the plane go down?

04:24.875 --> 04:26.875
Area was mostly farmland
back in '44

04:26.959 --> 04:32.333
but the NTSB said her oil and
coolant lines were switched.

04:32.417 --> 04:34.583
Looking at a case of sabotage.

04:35.792 --> 04:39.667
Someone wanted
this flier grounded.

05:12.291 --> 05:13.875
(Rush)
"Vivian Lynn, 22 years old

05:13.959 --> 05:16.458
grew up on a farm
in Belle Plaine, Iowa."

05:16.542 --> 05:18.166
(Vera)
Here.

05:18.250 --> 05:20.417
Flew a crop duster
for her family.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.834
"Applied for the
WASP program in '43."

05:23.917 --> 05:25.542
(Vera)
'Young Betties in a cockpit?'

05:25.625 --> 05:27.333
Think I would have heard
of 'em before now.

05:27.417 --> 05:29.458
Vivian was stationed
in Wilmington,
Delaware

05:29.542 --> 05:31.208
at New Castle Army Air Base.

05:31.291 --> 05:35.333
She took off June 2,
1944,
at 0600 hours

05:35.417 --> 05:37.542
to deliver the P-51 to..

05:37.625 --> 05:40.083
...Camp Davis in North Carolina?

05:40.166 --> 05:42.917
Declared missing in service
when she never showed.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.083
Army searched
for her plane till July.

05:45.166 --> 05:47.750
The orders were to fly south,
but her plane was in Philly

05:47.834 --> 05:50.125
so why was she traveling north?

05:50.208 --> 05:52.041
Back then,
most planes didn't have radar.

05:52.125 --> 05:53.667
Some of them didn't
even have radios.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.625
You couldn't track a
plane
once it was in the air.

05:55.709 --> 05:57.583
So, Vivian was bucking
her orders?

05:57.667 --> 05:59.875
- Flying somewhere else?
- Doer had access to her
plane.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.625
Knew how to switch
coolant and oil
lines.

06:02.709 --> 06:04.041
Could be a mechanic.

06:04.125 --> 06:06.875
Can't imagine the men were
too happy sharing their base.

06:06.959 --> 06:08.583
I'll check the records
for anyone fits the bill.

06:08.667 --> 06:11.458
Ask the base for flight
schedules, accident reports.

06:11.542 --> 06:14.291
Bunkmate was Betty Joe Henders.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.041
Lives in Germantown.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.583
If anyone had a beef
with Vivian, she'd know.

06:18.667 --> 06:19.959
Can't wait to meet one
of these Betties.

06:20.041 --> 06:21.417
Slow down.
Just slow down,
Pops.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.625
Wha-what do you mean

06:22.709 --> 06:25.959
money's missing
from your
account?

06:26.041 --> 06:27.458
Well, what do you want me to do?

06:27.542 --> 06:29.125
Ask ma.

06:29.208 --> 06:31.875
Yeah, I'm at work.
I'll-I'll call you back.

06:35.041 --> 06:38.291
Found the WASP C.O.
Iris Keening.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.208
Still in Wilmington, Delaware.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.625
Huh, headed up the search party
for Vivian herself.

06:42.709 --> 06:44.917
Well, go have a talk, see
if she can shed some light

06:45.000 --> 06:47.917
on why Vivian was flying
over
the City of Brotherly Love.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.500
Army said winds
caused the crash

07:00.583 --> 07:02.959
but that girl could have
flown
through a tornado

07:03.041 --> 07:05.667
and been in the mess hall
at chowtime.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.500
Ah, you headed
up the search party?

07:07.583 --> 07:10.792
Thirty eight girls died
in crashes during the two
years

07:10.875 --> 07:12.667
the program was up and running.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.291
- Brave women.
- Pioneers.

07:14.375 --> 07:18.750
Knew if they failed, no women
after them would stand a
chance.

07:18.834 --> 07:21.333
Who would have had access
to Vivian's plane?

07:21.417 --> 07:23.709
Um, known how to
switch the lines?

07:23.792 --> 07:27.625
Hmm, mechanics, instructors,
all the pilots.

07:27.709 --> 07:31.333
Any ideas why she
was flying off course?

07:31.417 --> 07:33.333
Rumor was, she had a boyfriend.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.792
(Iris)
'City slicker in Manhattan.'

07:35.875 --> 07:38.375
Remember a name?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.875
Vivian wasn't like
the other gals.

07:40.959 --> 07:42.792
Showed up late to her first day

07:42.875 --> 07:44.875
hot doggin' in her own
crop duster.

07:44.959 --> 07:46.750
Attitude didn't get
her washed out?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.875
Can't wash out your best pilot.

07:48.959 --> 07:51.125
I needed her on the schedule.

07:51.208 --> 07:52.709
Anyone you think of
had a problem with her?

07:52.792 --> 07:57.375
Vivian had a habit of
rubbing people the wrong way.

07:57.458 --> 08:02.709
Hate to say it, but "Miss HP"
only cared about one person..

08:02.792 --> 08:04.250
...herself.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.083
Edna!

08:36.166 --> 08:38.417
Come on,
give her some oxygen.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.583
'There you go,
there you go.'

08:40.667 --> 08:41.959
'Just breathe.'

08:52.625 --> 08:53.917
Miss Lynn, you've
set a new record.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.208
All for one.
Huh, Viv?

08:56.291 --> 08:58.375
Reckon you could have
at least given her a hand.

08:58.458 --> 09:01.083
Somebody's got to fly
the plane for you nurses.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.625
She wasn't interested
in making friends.

09:05.709 --> 09:09.291
Each week, the WASP flight
scores were posted on a chart.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.166
And Vivian wanted to be on top.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.667
Wouldn't settle
for anything less.

09:13.750 --> 09:17.625
Gonna need a list of those
WASP.
Their instructor, too.

09:17.709 --> 09:19.041
It's all in my book.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.625
Listed alphabetically
in the appendix.

09:28.291 --> 09:29.500
"Happy landings always."

09:29.583 --> 09:32.208
What we WASP say
instead of goodbye.

09:37.750 --> 09:39.375
Betty Joe Henders?

09:43.792 --> 09:45.166
Y'all call me Grammy.

09:45.250 --> 09:48.000
Everybody else does.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.917
You were a
pursuit
pilot, right?

09:50.000 --> 09:54.166
Lifetime ago. Never fit in
those
itty-bitty cockpits now.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.250
You understand.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.250
Detectives Jeffries, Vera.

09:57.333 --> 10:00.834
You were Vivian Lynn's bunkmate
at New Castle Airbase?

10:00.917 --> 10:03.750
Haven't heard that name in ages.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.166
Detectives?

10:05.250 --> 10:07.667
Thought bad weather
caused the crash.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.542
How'd you two get along?

10:09.625 --> 10:11.291
Peas in a pod.

10:11.375 --> 10:14.166
Both from small
towns,
poor families.

10:14.250 --> 10:15.667
You fly a crop duster too?

10:15.750 --> 10:19.500
I took the Army's civil
course
for my pilot's license.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.500
Had to beg my cousin Donald

10:22.583 --> 10:25.667
for the last sawbuck,
just to afford the classes.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.750
When was the last time
you saw Vivian?

10:27.834 --> 10:29.709
Day or two
before she
disappeared.

10:29.792 --> 10:32.375
She ever talk about going
to New York, meet a boyfriend?

10:32.458 --> 10:36.917
Gals were all khaki
wacky,
but not Viv.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.041
'Course we didn't call the
base
"The Snake Pit" for nothing.

10:43.709 --> 10:47.542
Huh! Kick the tires and light
the fires. I'm on a roll.

10:47.625 --> 10:48.625
You wanna go again?

10:48.709 --> 10:50.125
Game's making me thirsty.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.041
Think I'll get some juice.

10:52.125 --> 10:53.709
Suit yourself, Louise.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.291
Hey, what do you say, Edna?

10:55.375 --> 10:57.875
Can't you let her
win
just once?

10:57.959 --> 11:00.083
Don't see any of them flyboys
throwing a game.

11:00.166 --> 11:03.750
So...army's made it
clear,
we ain't one of 'em.

11:03.834 --> 11:06.458
Doing the same job,
not getting paid near as much.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.583
It won't change either till
we show them we're as tough

11:08.667 --> 11:09.917
as they are.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.375
Tougher even.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.333
You need a lesson there, doll?

11:18.959 --> 11:21.166
You can call me Wolf.

11:21.250 --> 11:22.583
I could teach
you
a thing or two.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.583
You see, it's..

11:24.667 --> 11:26.041
it's all in the wrist.

11:26.125 --> 11:28.417
Gosh, are you a real-life pilot?

11:28.500 --> 11:30.041
(Wolf)
'Shouldn't even be
telling you this.'

11:30.125 --> 11:32.250
Loose lips
sink ships and
all.

11:34.291 --> 11:36.583
I fly the B-26.

11:36.667 --> 11:37.959
So, they call it the Widow Maker

11:38.041 --> 11:40.250
'cause the last three pilots..

11:40.333 --> 11:41.458
...bought the farm.

11:41.542 --> 11:43.875
"The Widow Maker?"
That sounds dangerous.

11:43.959 --> 11:45.583
Say, you're not married,
are you?

11:45.667 --> 11:47.500
No, I'm lookin' for
somebody
to fill the position.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.166
Maybe you'd like to apply.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.458
Gettin' ahead
of yourself, flyboy.

11:50.542 --> 11:51.750
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

11:51.834 --> 11:54.041
Hey, get your meat hooks
off of me!

12:00.375 --> 12:02.709
You're gonna regret
that, little miss.

12:11.792 --> 12:13.583
Wolf was lathered up, alright.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.625
Won't take a no
for an answer.

12:15.709 --> 12:17.500
He didn't know
Vivian was a WASP?

12:17.583 --> 12:19.333
Lordy no, we were in our civvies

12:19.417 --> 12:23.625
due to the fundamental
dislike
of a woman in uniform.

12:23.709 --> 12:24.834
This Wolf's got a real name?

12:24.917 --> 12:26.417
Just knew him as Wolf.

12:26.500 --> 12:30.083
Us girls kept a "Naughty"
and "Nice" list by the
phone.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.291
Vivian put him
on the Naughty
side.

12:32.375 --> 12:35.125
No one went
near that animal
again.

12:35.208 --> 12:37.750
One pilot
with the call sign
Wolf.

12:37.834 --> 12:40.291
- Herbert James.
- Herbert?

12:40.375 --> 12:41.792
No wonder he preferred Wolf.

12:41.875 --> 12:45.500
Any relation to Frank James,
the WASP's instructor?

12:45.583 --> 12:47.583
Brothers. Whole
family
of flyboys.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.208
Guy had a real problem
with women.

12:49.291 --> 12:52.125
There's, uh,
five charges of misconduct.

12:52.208 --> 12:54.166
Way of saying
"sexual
harassment"

12:54.250 --> 12:55.417
back in the day.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.291
Vivian goes missing
two weeks after Wolf

12:57.375 --> 12:59.834
harassed her at the all-ranks
club on base.

12:59.917 --> 13:03.333
He was completing
his final flight test that
day.

13:03.417 --> 13:05.458
Would've had access
to the hangar.

13:05.542 --> 13:06.959
Oh, maybe Wolf decided
he wasn't gonna be

13:07.041 --> 13:08.917
the only one to crash and burn.

13:25.834 --> 13:27.834
You wanna explain
this complaint?

13:27.917 --> 13:30.000
It was filed with
Internal Affairs last
night

13:30.083 --> 13:32.583
by Moe Kitchener.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.083
Ah, we aren't doing our jobs
if we don't get

13:34.166 --> 13:35.458
some complaints, right?

13:35.542 --> 13:37.333
Situation's
interfering
with your job, Lil.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.709
Wouldn't be, if
the judge did his job.

13:38.792 --> 13:40.792
I understand what
you're going
through.

13:40.875 --> 13:43.542
But Doherty's looking
for excuses like this.

13:43.625 --> 13:46.083
The whole division
is under scrutiny.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.792
I hear you, boss.

13:47.875 --> 13:49.333
Good.

14:07.542 --> 14:10.250
You're a hard man
to find, Herbert.

14:10.333 --> 14:13.792
Kicked out of five
retirement
homes for spreading a VD.

14:13.875 --> 14:15.583
Four retirement homes.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.000
And it was those broads
gave that VD--

14:17.083 --> 14:18.667
I-I d-don't wanna hear it.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.750
Spend much time at the
bar,
when you were stationed

14:20.834 --> 14:22.709
in New Castle, Wolf?

14:22.792 --> 14:24.500
(Wolf)
New Castle, sure.

14:24.583 --> 14:25.792
There was
some nice scenery.

14:25.875 --> 14:27.417
Vivian Lynn part
of that scenery?

14:27.500 --> 14:28.709
Vivian Lynn, the gal

14:28.792 --> 14:30.417
that disappeared
in the Mustang,
right?

14:30.500 --> 14:33.625
Mustang took a nose dive
in the Roxborough
Reservoir.

14:33.709 --> 14:35.375
Wasn't an accident after all.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.458
Now, wait a second. You sayin'
I had something to do with it?

14:37.542 --> 14:38.625
Heard she gave you quite
the spanking

14:38.709 --> 14:40.000
two weeks before she crashed.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.875
(Vera)
Pulled a Little Red
Riding Hood on you.

14:41.959 --> 14:43.125
You gotta
show her who's boss.

14:43.208 --> 14:44.917
Oh, you got it
all wrong,
fellas.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.959
Even a wolf knows you don't
bite
the hand that feeds you.

14:49.959 --> 14:52.333
Come on, Frank,
let me skip this one lesson.

14:52.417 --> 14:54.291
You know, if you can't do
a favor for your own
brother--

14:54.375 --> 14:56.542
I do favors for you, how you
gonna learn responsibility?

14:56.625 --> 14:58.917
Okay, Widow Maker's
a flying coffin.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.667
Wanna send another
telegram home to ma?

15:00.750 --> 15:02.291
Charlie ain't even cold yet.

15:02.375 --> 15:03.542
Ma ain't losing
another son, Wolf.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.083
You're not gonna crash.

15:05.166 --> 15:07.792
Won't even get a chance
to drop a bomb on them
Krauts.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.750
Last three guys
landed
in a smoking hole!

15:09.834 --> 15:11.625
Three guys,
but no women.

15:11.709 --> 15:13.625
(Frank)
'Vivs here, just earned
the first perfect score'

15:13.709 --> 15:15.000
on the B-26.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.458
She's a pilot?

15:17.542 --> 15:18.959
She'll be teaching you
to fly The Widow Maker.

15:19.041 --> 15:21.500
Vivian, meet your next
student,
my brother Wolf.

15:21.583 --> 15:24.792
Wolf, huh? Now, how'd you
get a name like that?

15:24.875 --> 15:26.083
(Frank)
You got any tips for him?

15:26.166 --> 15:28.166
He's fixing to wet
his flight suit.

15:28.250 --> 15:31.125
Oh, it's all
in the wrist, flyboy.

15:31.208 --> 15:33.625
(Iris)
Nice score, Miss HP!

15:33.709 --> 15:34.667
Top of the chart.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.333
Uh, ya'll know
what that means.

15:36.417 --> 15:39.125
We have got
one hot pilot!

15:39.208 --> 15:40.583
(all)
Better cool her off!

15:40.667 --> 15:42.667
(Vivian)
No! No!

15:45.750 --> 15:48.667
(all)
...two, three!

15:56.208 --> 15:58.500
I gotta admit, she was
a pretty good teacher.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.834
Never lost her cool.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.417
Can't say the that
for the rest of 'em.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.625
What do you mean?

16:02.709 --> 16:04.750
Girls didn't belong
on that base.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.709
Weren't meant to be pilots.

16:06.792 --> 16:08.250
Sounds like you were still
trying to get even.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.583
With Frank around?
Are you kiddin'?

16:10.667 --> 16:14.458
Two Type-A pilots,
match made in Army heaven.

16:14.542 --> 16:16.500
Saying your brother
had a thing for Vivian?

16:16.583 --> 16:17.709
Well, I didn't know
it at the time

16:17.792 --> 16:19.041
but yeah,
he was stuck on her.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.709
- How long?
- Few weeks.

16:20.792 --> 16:22.375
He was an
officer,
I was a cadet.

16:22.458 --> 16:23.959
I had to stand down.

16:24.041 --> 16:26.208
Besides, bros before hos, huh?

16:34.709 --> 16:37.709
New Castle archive department
can't locate the flight logs

16:37.792 --> 16:39.291
or the monthly records.

16:39.375 --> 16:43.000
Got mechanics records, but most
of them are pushing daisies.

16:43.083 --> 16:45.500
Looked into the 38
WASP killed in wrecks.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.417
One was in Vivian's class,
Edna Reed.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.083
Accident report say anything
about her lines being
switched?

16:50.166 --> 16:54.166
Burned pistons. Looking like
routine mechanical failure.

16:54.250 --> 16:58.583
I, uh, heard about the IAB.

16:58.667 --> 16:59.917
Moe's complaint.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.667
Oh, uh, hmm,
got him on the
ropes.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.041
Good.

17:07.166 --> 17:08.792
You headed somewhere?

17:08.875 --> 17:10.917
Uh, taking lost time.

17:11.000 --> 17:11.917
Everything okay?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.208
Sure, yeah, it's nothing.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.500
Hey.

17:17.583 --> 17:20.208
What color does this
look like to you?

17:20.291 --> 17:22.125
Call it rucksack gray.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.166
Mind if I borrow that?

17:35.709 --> 17:36.959
(Scotty)
'Hey, ma.'

17:37.917 --> 17:40.250
Scotty, what are
you doing here?

17:40.333 --> 17:42.750
Ah, I was just driving past.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.500
I saw you walking
out of the
doctor's.

17:44.583 --> 17:45.500
Everything okay?

17:45.583 --> 17:46.792
Uh, yeah, I just had to

17:46.875 --> 17:48.667
uh, take Mrs. Melztner

17:48.750 --> 17:52.041
to, uh, Dr. Kantor's office.

17:52.125 --> 17:55.625
You were in Suite 4A, right?

17:55.709 --> 17:58.417
Says Dr. Ruben
on the
directory.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.458
Just driving by, huh?

18:00.542 --> 18:02.458
You sick, ma?

18:02.542 --> 18:04.625
You following me like
some kind of criminal?

18:04.709 --> 18:08.417
Just...tell me
what's going
on.

18:10.083 --> 18:12.542
I've got a bad knee,
that's it.

18:13.542 --> 18:15.333
Then why you paying in cash?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
What is this,
the third degree?

18:20.083 --> 18:24.166
Are you a cop,
or you're my son?

18:24.250 --> 18:25.792
<i>Mi hijo..</i>

18:28.375 --> 18:30.625
Will you trust me?

18:30.709 --> 18:32.375
I'm fine.

18:32.458 --> 18:33.834
It's just my knee.

18:35.792 --> 18:39.125
Remember...how I could make
everything better..

18:39.208 --> 18:41.417
...with a Rice Krispy treat?

18:41.500 --> 18:42.542
Mm.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.375
- I'll see you.
- Bye, ma.

19:00.166 --> 19:03.375
You close with
Vivian Lynn, Frank?

19:03.458 --> 19:05.875
She was my best
student, ma'am.

19:05.959 --> 19:07.834
She something
more than that?

19:07.917 --> 19:10.959
Well, I guess you could say
we were an item.

19:11.041 --> 19:14.875
I kept it quiet
'cause I was her
instructor.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.250
Hey, what's this about?

19:16.333 --> 19:18.750
Well, Vivian's plane
was sabotaged.

19:18.834 --> 19:21.542
Your girl was flying
off course, Frank.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.542
Do you know why?

19:22.625 --> 19:24.875
She was an ace navigator.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.500
Male pilots used to
follow
her back to the base.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.125
She was the only one
who could always find her
way.

19:30.208 --> 19:32.250
Chance she was flying
to meet a new steady?

19:32.333 --> 19:34.291
Oh, no, ma'am.

19:34.375 --> 19:37.166
A lot of things can go wrong
in a relationship..

19:37.250 --> 19:38.500
...spirited girl like that.

19:38.583 --> 19:40.917
Look here, I loved Vivian.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.750
I admired her for what she
was doing for her country.

19:44.834 --> 19:47.709
They weren't
all
as patriotic.

19:51.417 --> 19:53.500
Thought I'd find you here.

19:55.208 --> 19:57.917
I've never
seen
anything like
it.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.333
One of a kind.

20:00.417 --> 20:02.417
Who do you think
they'll let fly
it?

20:02.500 --> 20:04.834
Know anyone
with perfect scores?

20:11.250 --> 20:14.792
Fly this, I might just
break
the sound barrier
someday.

20:14.875 --> 20:16.333
Flipped your wig?

20:16.417 --> 20:19.709
No one can survive
flying
750 miles an hour, Viv.

20:19.792 --> 20:21.208
Your heart'll seize up.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.542
I know you miss
your baby brother.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.583
This isn't about Charlie, Viv.

20:27.667 --> 20:29.667
But you can't protect everyone.

20:32.208 --> 20:36.542
The day my dad shipped out,
he wasn't scared at all.

20:36.625 --> 20:39.834
But I was.

20:39.917 --> 20:41.417
Must've been
a first for
you.

20:45.291 --> 20:50.458
He used to say we'd travel
with the wind and the stars.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.500
This just might get me there.

20:52.583 --> 20:55.125
I'll take that trip,
if you're piloting.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.166
- Viv!
- Betty Joe?

20:57.250 --> 20:59.333
Get your scrawny ass out here!

21:01.625 --> 21:03.750
You been ripping
my ration books?

21:03.834 --> 21:05.792
Next time I won't just
tear 'em up, I'll report
you.

21:05.875 --> 21:07.500
You best not be threatening me!

21:07.583 --> 21:09.000
Stealing ration
books,
you might as well

21:09.083 --> 21:11.500
be taking bullets
from our boys'
guns.

21:11.583 --> 21:12.959
There a problem, ladies?

21:16.041 --> 21:19.208
I wash out...sure as hell
gonna be.

21:29.875 --> 21:34.166
I always thought Betty Joe
was a harmless Southern belle.

21:35.208 --> 21:36.959
She was profiteering.

21:37.041 --> 21:39.875
The war caused shortages..

21:39.959 --> 21:42.333
...coffee, food, gasoline.

21:42.417 --> 21:44.834
Had to have a government
ration book to buy 'em.

21:44.917 --> 21:46.625
If anyone had gotten
wind
of what she was doin'

21:46.709 --> 21:49.208
she'd have been
tried for
treason.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.375
Betty Joe didn't
wash out, did she?

21:51.458 --> 21:52.667
No, ma'am.

21:52.750 --> 21:57.041
But three days later,
Vivian took off.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.000
Never came back.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.041
(Jeffries)
Thanks for coming
in,
Betty Joe.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.166
I know you wanted
to get your mums

22:09.250 --> 22:10.417
in the ground today.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.417
Said yesterday you had
to scrape together money

22:12.500 --> 22:14.834
just to join the WASP.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.417
Cousin Donald chipped in.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.542
Remember what Donald did
during the war?

22:18.625 --> 22:21.041
4-F.
He couldn't fight.

22:21.125 --> 22:22.208
Worked a government job.

22:22.291 --> 22:23.959
That's right.

22:24.041 --> 22:26.458
Worked at a government
incineration station

22:26.542 --> 22:27.792
burning ration books.

22:27.875 --> 22:29.417
(Vera)
''Course they all didn't
find their way'

22:29.500 --> 22:31.750
to the incinerator,
did they, Betty Joe?

22:31.834 --> 22:33.500
Y'all are whistlin' Dixie.

22:33.583 --> 22:35.709
(Jeffries)
'He'd sell them.
Only one problem.'

22:35.792 --> 22:37.500
Had to get 'em
on the black
market

22:37.583 --> 22:39.709
before their
serial
numbers expired.

22:39.792 --> 22:43.291
That's where it was helpful
having access to a plane.

22:45.417 --> 22:47.083
Not proud of what I did.

22:47.166 --> 22:51.625
Husband gunned down
six months earlier over
Berlin.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.250
I did it for my babies.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.792
(Vera)
'Those babies the reason
you had to keep Vivian quiet'

22:58.875 --> 22:59.834
about the whole thing?

22:59.917 --> 23:01.959
I didn't hurt Vivian.

23:02.041 --> 23:04.583
I was upset 'cause I thought
all she wanted was to..

23:04.667 --> 23:07.792
to wash out her competition.

23:07.875 --> 23:10.875
Then I saw a whole
'nother side of
her.

23:13.250 --> 23:14.834
(Edna)
'I failed my last check
ride.'

23:14.917 --> 23:17.583
If I don't pass this one,
I'm gonna be washed out.

23:17.667 --> 23:21.709
No one's washin' out. Just do as
I say, everything will be fine.

23:21.792 --> 23:23.625
Is it true you learned
to fly your crop duster

23:23.709 --> 23:25.917
when you were just six?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.458
Flying's gotta be second nature.

23:27.542 --> 23:30.500
Gotta know the controls
without even lookin' at 'em.

23:30.583 --> 23:31.750
I don't know, Viv.

23:31.834 --> 23:34.834
It's better
if I just wash out
now.

23:34.917 --> 23:37.375
I thought you said
you had a brother overseas.

23:40.417 --> 23:41.583
Jimmy.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.959
Call him Cricket.

23:46.041 --> 23:48.250
Well, think of Cricket
when you fly.

23:48.333 --> 23:51.834
The next plane you deliver
might just save his life.

23:51.917 --> 23:53.542
(Vivian)
'The more air support
our boys get'

23:53.625 --> 23:56.792
the more of 'em
that'll come home.

23:56.875 --> 23:59.333
Do you got any
family
in the war, Viv?

24:00.834 --> 24:02.709
Army said my dad was too old.

24:02.792 --> 24:05.000
Wanted him to fly trainers.

24:05.083 --> 24:08.583
He insisted on crewing a B-17.

24:08.667 --> 24:10.250
Got himself killed.

24:17.834 --> 24:21.000
(Edna)
Battery. Propeller.
Booster pumps. Landing gear.

24:21.083 --> 24:23.375
Yes! Hey, you're ready, Edna.

24:23.458 --> 24:24.583
Gosh, you really think so, Viv?

24:24.667 --> 24:27.625
Are you kiddin'?
You're a regular Miss HP.

24:30.125 --> 24:33.208
Took Vivian's advice myself.

24:33.291 --> 24:34.792
Thought of my husband.

24:34.875 --> 24:38.583
Reckoned I couldn't honor
him
and do what I was doin'.

24:38.667 --> 24:41.709
So you stopped smuggling ration
booklets right then and there?

24:41.792 --> 24:44.750
Never got the
chance
to tell her.

24:44.834 --> 24:46.959
She was gone
by the time I got
back.

24:47.041 --> 24:49.709
Saying you weren't on base
when Vivian disappeared?

24:49.792 --> 24:54.208
Off deliverin' a
plane
to, uh, Sweetwater.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.250
Still got my log
book
to prove it.

24:56.333 --> 24:57.875
We're gonna need to see that.

24:57.959 --> 25:00.875
Got the monthly flight
records
and schedules, too.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.834
Saved everything.

25:02.917 --> 25:05.583
Shame she never got
the one thing she
wanted.

25:05.667 --> 25:06.750
What was that?

25:06.834 --> 25:10.083
To be the first
woman
to fly that jet.

25:10.166 --> 25:12.041
- Remember who was?
- Sure.

25:12.125 --> 25:14.208
Vivian's main competition.

25:14.291 --> 25:16.417
Louise Patterson.

25:19.667 --> 25:21.750
Louise Patterson?

25:21.834 --> 25:23.875
Yes?

25:26.208 --> 25:28.583
Flew the Bell P-59, right?

25:28.667 --> 25:30.458
First woman ever.

25:30.542 --> 25:32.500
You two looking
for an interview?

25:32.583 --> 25:34.250
You could say that.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.083
Detectives Valens, Rush.

25:36.166 --> 25:39.041
Remember your old WASP buddy,
Vivian Lynn?

25:39.125 --> 25:41.959
Of course I remember Vivian.
Real live wire.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.667
How'd you feel when Vivian
dusted you on the score
chart?

25:44.750 --> 25:46.000
Check your facts.

25:46.083 --> 25:47.458
I was on top of the chart.

25:47.542 --> 25:48.834
Oh, by default.

25:48.917 --> 25:52.458
- The better pilot was
murdered.
- Murdered?

25:52.542 --> 25:53.458
Oh, dear God, how?

25:53.542 --> 25:54.750
I read your cover story

25:54.834 --> 25:56.917
in "The
Atlantic,"
September '54.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.583
First woman to
break
the sound barrier.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.583
Said you'd do
anything
to set that record.

26:00.667 --> 26:03.000
That include getting
rid
of your competition?

26:03.083 --> 26:04.792
Look, you're right.

26:04.875 --> 26:07.000
Vivian and I had a rocky start.

26:07.083 --> 26:12.166
But we bonded in a way
I could never have imagined.

26:14.375 --> 26:16.625
Crash! It's Edna!

26:16.709 --> 26:17.875
- No!
- 'Vivian..'

26:17.959 --> 26:19.625
- No!
- Wait!

26:19.709 --> 26:21.417
(Vivian)
'No!'

26:21.500 --> 26:25.500
No, no, no.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.166
There is nothing
you
could have done.

26:27.250 --> 26:29.500
No, Edna was ready.
I taught her myself.

26:29.583 --> 26:30.583
Checked her plane myself.

26:30.667 --> 26:33.125
Someone did this to her!

27:33.458 --> 27:36.667
Not a day goes by I don't
think
about one of those women.

27:36.750 --> 27:39.375
Vivian thought the men
wanted the WASP gone?

27:39.458 --> 27:43.208
WASP were doing the same jobs
as male pilots.

27:43.291 --> 27:45.083
Freeing up men
for combat
duty.

27:45.166 --> 27:47.959
Only by this time,
the war was winding down.

27:48.041 --> 27:51.250
Army had enough pilots.
It needed infantry.

27:51.333 --> 27:53.625
Some of the guys were afraid
they were gonna lose their
jobs?

27:53.709 --> 27:55.917
And be drafted as foot soldiers.

27:57.792 --> 27:59.500
What ya got, Scotty?

27:59.583 --> 28:04.917
Uh, Army said, uh, Edna's
crash
was a mechanical failure

28:05.000 --> 28:08.083
due to clogged fuel
lines
and burned pistons.

28:08.166 --> 28:09.875
But this maintenance report

28:09.959 --> 28:12.583
says her lines were
flushed
two days prior.

28:12.667 --> 28:14.083
Airport mechanic I spoke to said

28:14.166 --> 28:16.417
they should've still
been squeaky clean.

28:16.500 --> 28:19.083
What if Vivian was
on to the sabotage?

28:19.166 --> 28:21.250
Doer decides
to silence her for good.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.291
Mechanic say what could cause
the pistons to burn?

28:23.375 --> 28:26.083
The only thing he could think
of was sugar in the gas tank.

28:26.166 --> 28:28.250
But sugar was hard to come by
during the war.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.583
Not if you were in the Army.

28:29.667 --> 28:32.709
You still got the
New Castle PX ledgers?

28:32.792 --> 28:35.709
Uh, yeah. Uh..

28:35.792 --> 28:36.959
Uh, here.

28:41.333 --> 28:44.458
Sugar was bought
the day before Edna crashed.

28:44.542 --> 28:46.166
Ten pounds.

28:46.250 --> 28:48.792
That's enough to gum up
the works of any engine.

28:48.875 --> 28:52.542
Signed for by one, Frank James.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.500
(Rush)
Cool your engines, Saccardo.

28:56.583 --> 28:58.875
I'll be there in ten.

28:58.959 --> 29:00.792
Okay, me, too.

29:02.291 --> 29:03.583
Bye.

29:06.208 --> 29:09.250
Big date tonight?

29:09.333 --> 29:11.625
I was just heading out
to mess with you some
more.

29:14.583 --> 29:17.458
You wanna back up
your car now?

29:17.542 --> 29:19.834
Car dry up or they
got you a new one?

29:22.709 --> 29:24.500
I said back away.

29:27.583 --> 29:30.250
You gonna shoot me,
detective?

29:30.333 --> 29:34.917
Now, how do you think that'll
look after I filed a
complaint?

29:35.000 --> 29:39.917
The more you push,
the less I have to lose.

30:08.083 --> 30:10.333
Been reading up
on my WASP history.

30:10.417 --> 30:11.792
You got something
off Vivian's skirt?

30:11.875 --> 30:14.375
Sent it to
Criminalistics
on a hunch.

30:14.458 --> 30:18.333
Found traces
of "Alizarin
cyanines."

30:18.417 --> 30:20.041
Hmm, some kind of chemical?

30:20.125 --> 30:22.959
Uh, used in Santiago Blue dye.

30:23.041 --> 30:25.792
Skirt was a part
of Vivian's dress uniform.

30:27.709 --> 30:30.041
(Vera)
'She wasn't flying north
for a date.'

30:30.125 --> 30:32.125
She was on official business.

30:32.208 --> 30:34.208
(Stillman)
Lil, Frank's in the box.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.375
You ready?

30:48.208 --> 30:52.041
Fear is a funny
thing,
isn't it, Frank?

30:52.125 --> 30:54.000
I don't know what you mean, sir.

30:54.083 --> 30:58.083
You were drafted in '43,
supposed to ship off to
Europe.

30:58.166 --> 31:00.834
But you became
a flight instructor
instead.

31:00.917 --> 31:01.875
Kept you on American soil.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.542
I served my country, sir.

31:03.625 --> 31:06.000
(Stillman)
'WASP wanted to be
recognized as equals.'

31:06.083 --> 31:08.208
Have the same
benefits
as Army men.

31:08.291 --> 31:09.834
But if that happened

31:09.917 --> 31:13.000
there'd be even fewer
jobs
for men stateside.

31:13.083 --> 31:14.917
You might've been
dodging bullets

31:15.000 --> 31:16.375
on a beach
in Normandy
instead.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.083
I lost a baby brother
over there.

31:18.166 --> 31:20.792
You think maybe you could scare
them into quitting, Frank?

31:22.792 --> 31:24.417
Hmm, you a tough guy?

31:27.375 --> 31:28.792
I get to do that, too.

31:28.875 --> 31:32.208
I helped those girls.

31:32.291 --> 31:34.583
Anything they needed,
I was there for 'em.

31:37.333 --> 31:39.417
This your signature, Frank?

31:41.333 --> 31:44.458
That much sugar'd do
a real number on an
engine.

31:44.542 --> 31:47.041
I didn't sign this.

31:47.125 --> 31:49.667
You're saying someone
forged your signature?

31:51.375 --> 31:53.041
Vivian tried to tell me..

31:54.583 --> 31:56.750
...but I wouldn't listen.

32:09.083 --> 32:11.875
Viv? Is that you?

32:11.959 --> 32:13.375
I had to see you.

32:13.458 --> 32:15.166
Get caught past taps,
they'll wash you out.

32:15.250 --> 32:17.041
I checked the mechanic's log.

32:17.125 --> 32:18.667
Edna's fuel lines were
flushed
two days ago.

32:18.750 --> 32:19.917
Slow down.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.792
Her plane shouldn't
have stalled, Frank.

32:22.875 --> 32:24.333
Viv, you're upset.

32:26.458 --> 32:29.041
I saw Wolf milling around the
hangar last night by himself.

32:29.125 --> 32:30.834
He said he was
filling
out his flight log

32:30.917 --> 32:33.417
but I know what he was doing.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.458
I think he
sabotaged
Edna's plane.

32:35.542 --> 32:36.917
Wolf would never do that.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.583
You know how he feels
about us girls.

32:38.667 --> 32:41.208
It's not like
he tries to hide
it.

32:41.291 --> 32:43.250
He's my brother, Viv.

32:44.750 --> 32:45.875
My brother.

32:45.959 --> 32:49.375
Edna was my friend.
And she's dead.

32:49.458 --> 32:51.041
You know what
my family's been through.

32:51.125 --> 32:54.125
Your family got a star
to hang in the window.

32:54.208 --> 32:55.458
What does Edna's family get?

32:55.542 --> 32:57.417
The Army won't even pay
to send her home.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.000
You want a damn star?

32:59.083 --> 33:01.417
I want Wolf court-martialed.

33:04.500 --> 33:05.959
I love you..

33:07.625 --> 33:09.709
...but planes crash, Viv.

33:19.125 --> 33:20.208
I thought we
were gonna
travel

33:20.291 --> 33:22.458
with the wind
and the stars.

33:33.667 --> 33:35.792
God help me
for not believing Vivian.

33:36.959 --> 33:40.083
My mother had already lost
a son in the war.

33:40.166 --> 33:42.792
I couldn't let her
lose another.

33:42.875 --> 33:45.083
Wolf know Vivian
was on his tail?

33:45.166 --> 33:49.125
I confronted him
about what she'd told me.

33:49.208 --> 33:50.583
He just denied it.

33:50.667 --> 33:51.792
When was that?

33:52.875 --> 33:55.750
It was the night
before she disappeared.

33:58.375 --> 34:00.250
All these years..

34:00.333 --> 34:01.834
...I looked out for him..

34:03.291 --> 34:06.458
...put him first.

34:06.542 --> 34:08.834
Think he'd do
the same for
you?

34:11.375 --> 34:13.125
Just got to get you
to sign a bail
petition

34:13.208 --> 34:14.291
for your brother, Wolf.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.208
Bail?
What'd Frank do?

34:17.625 --> 34:20.667
Laced Edna Reed's tank
with ten pounds of
sugar.

34:20.750 --> 34:23.917
Turning him over
to the MPs for Edna's
murder.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.458
Frank wouldn't hurt a fly.

34:25.542 --> 34:29.291
Got a New Castle PX ledger
with his signature on it.

34:42.542 --> 34:45.041
It wasn't Frank.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.583
It was me.

34:47.667 --> 34:49.250
(Wolf)
'Drank through my paycheck
that month.'

34:49.333 --> 34:51.542
I had to charge
everything
to Frank's account.

34:53.959 --> 34:55.834
I put that sugar in Edna's tank.

34:55.917 --> 34:58.166
I mean, me and the guys
had
done it to other gals
before.

34:58.250 --> 35:00.458
I figured she'd have hit
the silk like the others did

35:00.542 --> 35:02.166
parachute out
when the engine stalled.

35:02.250 --> 35:04.875
Report said the latch
on the cockpit was broken.

35:04.959 --> 35:07.125
I didn't know
about that
latch.

35:07.208 --> 35:09.542
She tried to bail
out,
and she couldn't.

35:09.625 --> 35:11.125
She was trapped.

35:13.750 --> 35:15.917
I didn't mean
to hurt that girl.

35:19.333 --> 35:22.583
I still have nightmares
about it to this day.

35:22.667 --> 35:24.333
Gonna need the names
of your co-conspirators.

35:24.417 --> 35:25.834
No, I'm taking the
bullet on this one.

35:25.917 --> 35:29.291
No sense in
tarnishing
their memories.

35:29.375 --> 35:31.542
Should've done it anyway
the night I went to see
Vivian.

35:31.625 --> 35:34.041
You saw Vivian
before she disappeared?

35:34.125 --> 35:35.542
I pleaded with her
not to report me.

35:35.625 --> 35:36.875
And she didn't listen

35:36.959 --> 35:38.458
so you took matters
into your own hands?

35:38.542 --> 35:41.083
No, I wouldn't touch a
hair
on that girl's head.

35:41.166 --> 35:42.709
Even if I wanted
to,
I couldn't.

35:42.792 --> 35:44.125
Why is that?

35:44.208 --> 35:45.792
She'd already filed a report.

35:45.875 --> 35:47.125
I saw her
signature
and everything.

35:47.208 --> 35:48.583
I just went back
to the barracks

35:48.667 --> 35:50.750
packed my duffel and waited.

35:52.291 --> 35:54.542
MP's never came.

35:54.625 --> 35:57.375
So who'd she file
that report with?

35:57.458 --> 36:01.208
When someone filed a report
with you, what'd you do with
it?

36:01.291 --> 36:02.750
Sent it up the chain of command.

36:02.834 --> 36:05.250
So when Vivian filed a report
about Edna Reed's crash

36:05.333 --> 36:06.542
you send that up?

36:06.625 --> 36:08.250
Edna's crash
was an accident.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.166
There wasn't a report.

36:12.250 --> 36:14.583
Weak sheep like Edna.

36:14.667 --> 36:16.667
Nothing but a
drain
on your program.

36:16.750 --> 36:17.875
You were probably happy

36:17.959 --> 36:21.375
to have someone
thin out the herd.

36:21.458 --> 36:24.959
You ask me,
they were probably all weak.

36:25.041 --> 36:27.583
Women fly as well as men.
It's on the record.

36:27.667 --> 36:30.750
Women took more money to train,
had more accidents.

36:30.834 --> 36:32.291
They can't hack
it in the sky.

36:32.375 --> 36:33.834
Enough, Scotty.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.667
Get some air.

36:48.542 --> 36:49.667
Yes, ma'am.

36:57.041 --> 36:59.166
I apologize for my partner.

37:00.208 --> 37:02.125
I know what it's like.

37:02.208 --> 37:03.583
You show one crack--

37:03.667 --> 37:05.709
Wolves tear you to pieces.

37:05.792 --> 37:07.291
Yeah.

37:07.375 --> 37:10.667
You know, I
finished
reading your book.

37:10.750 --> 37:12.750
You fought hard
for those girls.

37:12.834 --> 37:14.959
Had to fly every
month
to Mitchell Field

37:15.041 --> 37:17.083
to file a report
with General
Stockton.

37:17.166 --> 37:19.291
Orders to keep him in the loop.

37:19.375 --> 37:23.000
Made him see how important
the WASP were to the country.

37:23.083 --> 37:26.625
You said Viv might have
had
a boyfriend in Manhattan?

37:26.709 --> 37:27.917
You still believe that?

37:29.834 --> 37:32.250
Gal could have been flying
a million different places.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.583
How do I know?

37:34.417 --> 37:35.500
Now..

37:38.917 --> 37:42.709
Which bases are
north of
Wilmington?

37:42.792 --> 37:48.333
Otis in Massachusetts,
Mitchell Field in Long
Island.

37:48.417 --> 37:50.834
So if she were
flying
to Mitchell Field

37:50.917 --> 37:53.750
what would her landmarks
have been?

37:56.500 --> 37:59.667
After all these years,
hard to remember.

37:59.750 --> 38:02.667
But you flew it every month.

38:02.750 --> 38:04.917
Listen, I don't know
what you're gettin' at--

38:05.000 --> 38:07.291
Would Philly have
been
a landmark?

38:09.250 --> 38:12.417
One of the landmarks, yes.

38:12.500 --> 38:16.709
You know why Vivian would have
packed her Santiago Dress Blues?

38:16.792 --> 38:20.250
We found it in
the bullet
compartment.

38:20.333 --> 38:23.041
Maybe she was going
to see someone important

38:23.125 --> 38:25.333
like the general.

38:25.417 --> 38:27.375
I led the search party
for Vivian.

38:27.458 --> 38:28.625
She was my best pilot.

38:28.709 --> 38:29.875
Yeah, but the day Vivian left

38:29.959 --> 38:31.625
you put out next
month's
flight schedule

38:31.709 --> 38:35.125
and your best
pilot
wasn't on it.

38:37.083 --> 38:39.041
And there's only one
explanation for that,
Iris.

38:39.125 --> 38:43.542
Is you knew that
Vivian
wasn't coming back.

38:43.625 --> 38:46.083
I fought for those girls.
You said it yourself.

38:46.166 --> 38:47.875
But your program
was under attack

38:47.959 --> 38:51.625
and men were looking
for any excuse to shut it
down.

38:51.709 --> 38:53.709
Heard some zipperheads saying
the only way

38:53.792 --> 38:56.959
to keep us out of their jobs
was to knock us out of the
sky.

38:57.041 --> 38:59.250
And Edna's
"accident"
was a crack.

38:59.333 --> 39:01.750
If they knew men
were targeting us WASP

39:01.834 --> 39:04.458
it would've made headlines.
We would've lost it all.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.291
But Vivian wouldn't
stop
till everyone knew.

39:06.375 --> 39:08.458
You buried that report
for the greater good.

39:08.542 --> 39:11.834
Women fly combat today
because of the WASP.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.750
Because of what we did.

39:13.834 --> 39:16.458
Little girls look up to me.

39:16.542 --> 39:18.875
I speak for the WASP.

39:18.959 --> 39:21.333
I speak for you.

39:22.542 --> 39:24.709
I speak for Vivian.

39:28.625 --> 39:30.667
She left me no choice.

39:34.417 --> 39:36.041
MP's still
haven't
picked up Wolf.

39:36.125 --> 39:39.458
There's no formal
investigation
of Edna's crash.

39:39.542 --> 39:42.542
- Your point, Miss Lynn?
- You canned my report.

39:43.959 --> 39:45.291
Do you know what'll happen
if they find out

39:45.375 --> 39:47.792
a man sabotaged a WASP plane?

39:47.875 --> 39:49.417
How this will look?

39:49.500 --> 39:51.500
It'll look like
what it is, murder.

39:51.583 --> 39:54.208
They're fighting a war, Vivian.

39:54.291 --> 39:56.458
You know how they'll fix
this?
They'll shut us down.

39:56.542 --> 39:59.125
That's what you're worried
about, the program?

39:59.208 --> 40:00.542
What about Edna?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.291
Edna is gone.

40:04.375 --> 40:06.750
There is nothing we can do
to bring her back, Vivian.

40:06.834 --> 40:09.458
Our job now is to take
care
of all the WASP.

40:09.542 --> 40:13.291
If the program is shut down,
we all have to stop flying.

40:13.375 --> 40:16.583
You'll never fly that jet.

40:17.792 --> 40:19.625
Edna deserves justice.

40:19.709 --> 40:23.834
She would do the same
for me, for all of us.

40:23.917 --> 40:28.208
No one needs to know that you
illegally covered up my report

40:28.291 --> 40:31.959
if you send it
up the chain today.

40:43.917 --> 40:45.125
You're right.

40:45.208 --> 40:47.208
I don't know
what
I was thinking.

40:47.291 --> 40:48.834
Go to Mitchell Field.

40:48.917 --> 40:51.333
Tell Stockton in person
what happened to Edna.

40:51.417 --> 40:53.333
General Stockton, ma'am?

40:53.417 --> 40:57.125
Don't ever let it be said
I don't look out for my
girls.

40:57.208 --> 40:58.750
Thank you, ma'am.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.208
Vivian.

41:01.291 --> 41:03.000
Gonna need
your Santiago Blues.

41:03.083 --> 41:04.875
Yes, ma'am.

41:05.583 --> 41:07.125
Happy landings.

41:08.291 --> 41:09.625
Always.
