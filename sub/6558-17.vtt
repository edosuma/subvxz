WEBVTT

00:13.097 --> 00:14.265
Huh?

01:44.063 --> 01:46.357
Here we are.
Wolf's End Lodge.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.777
Like, it even sounds like a wolf.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.988
That is a wolf, silly.

01:54.407 --> 01:58.953
What a rundown and creepy
place for a weekend of skiing.

01:59.287 --> 02:02.373
I know, but it's the only place
we could find.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.542
Come on. Let's go in.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.631
Welcome to Wolf's End Lodge.

02:12.341 --> 02:15.303
We have all the comforts of home.

02:15.720 --> 02:19.807
Yeah? Whose home?
Dracula's?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.728
It's cold out there.

02:25.438 --> 02:27.648
Excuse me for interrupting...

02:27.982 --> 02:33.612
but could you put this suitcase
in a safe place for me, Mr. Greenway?

02:36.282 --> 02:38.451
Certainly. Certainly.

02:38.868 --> 02:42.580
Nice doggy. Nice doggy.

02:50.755 --> 02:55.634
- Who's that?
- That's Mr. Leach, another guest.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.140
Now, if you'll be so kind...

03:01.307 --> 03:04.685
I'II show you to your rooms.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.606
This is the young ladies' room.

03:08.773 --> 03:11.400
The other rooms are across the hall.

03:11.567 --> 03:14.362
Oh, yes, a word of warning:

03:14.528 --> 03:19.450
Be sure to lock your doors and windows
before you go to sleep.

03:21.202 --> 03:24.205
Lock our doors and windows? Why?

03:24.747 --> 03:29.543
Because if you don't,
the snow ghost will get you...

03:30.669 --> 03:33.714
and turn you into ghosts.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.805
Snow ghost?!

03:40.971 --> 03:44.475
- Tum us into ghosts?
- Ghosts?!

03:59.323 --> 04:01.742
Well, it's time to turn in.

04:02.243 --> 04:05.579
Before we go, we'll make sure
the windows are all locked.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.498
Ifllcheckit

04:09.500 --> 04:12.837
It's locked. Ah!

04:16.132 --> 04:19.093
Zoinks! The snow ghost!

04:19.760 --> 04:21.262
Run!

04:22.805 --> 04:26.851
We gotta get out of here!
Come on! Gangway!

04:27.643 --> 04:29.270
Hang on!

04:33.899 --> 04:36.569
That snow ghost is for real,
all right.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.405
Look at the size of those footprints.

04:39.572 --> 04:41.490
Now what are we gonna do, Freddy?

04:41.657 --> 04:44.368
Get a couple of snow cars
and follow those tracks.

04:44.535 --> 04:47.037
I wanna find out about
our mysterious guest.

04:47.204 --> 04:52.626
Oh, boy, this ski trip's
turning into a real scare trip.

05:02.386 --> 05:05.681
Boy, that snow ghost sure gets around.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.412
The tracks end
at the edge of this chasm.

05:28.579 --> 05:33.000
Well, if he tried to walk across,
the first step is a doozy.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.881
The snow ghost!

05:39.840 --> 05:42.718
And he can fly! Duck!

05:52.102 --> 05:56.190
There he goes,
flying across the sky.

05:57.107 --> 06:02.655
- He disappeared behind those trees.
- That's where we're going. Come on!

06:06.951 --> 06:10.079
- This is where he went.
- But no snow ghost.

06:10.412 --> 06:13.290
Look, there's a cave
with a light coming from it.

06:13.457 --> 06:17.795
- Maybe that's where he lives.
- There's only one way to find out.

06:17.962 --> 06:21.257
- Go see if he's home, Scoob.
- Me?

06:21.423 --> 06:24.218
Sure. You can run the fastest
if he's there.

06:31.350 --> 06:35.938
- Now, cut that out.
- My leg! My leg!

07:00.921 --> 07:02.881
Oh, brother!

07:10.889 --> 07:12.516
Huh?

07:15.185 --> 07:16.437
Uh-oh.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.191
Scoob says the coast is clear.
Come on.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.865
What a strange cave.

07:28.032 --> 07:30.951
Yeah, like, furnished
in early Chinatown.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.747
This stuff isn't from China, Shaggy.
It's from Tibet.

07:34.913 --> 07:38.000
Well, it's for sure the snow ghost
doesn't live here.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.336
- Then who does?
- Hmm.

07:45.841 --> 07:49.970
Maybe if we ring this gong,
we'll find out.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.601
Who dares enter the temple
of PU Ian Chi?

07:55.768 --> 07:56.810
Yipe!

07:56.977 --> 08:00.814
I know this sounds silly,
but we were following a snow ghost.

08:01.106 --> 08:04.777
Yeah. And we thought
he might have come in here.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.571
Like, I don't think he believes us.

08:07.905 --> 08:13.077
I know you speak the truth,
for I am the one the snow ghost seeks.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.453
- You?
- You?

08:14.620 --> 08:17.623
Yes. Many years ago in Tibet...

08:17.790 --> 08:22.961
I came face to face
with a beast known as the yeti.

08:27.675 --> 08:31.595
<i>I leaped across a gorge
to the safety of a narrow ledge.</i>

08:45.234 --> 08:47.820
<i>But I had not seen the last of him...</i>

08:48.278 --> 08:52.533
<i>for his ghost returned
to seek revenge.</i>

08:57.955 --> 09:01.125
<i>And I was forced to flee for my life.</i>

09:01.375 --> 09:04.795
And now, after all these years
of hiding...

09:04.962 --> 09:07.840
he has found me once again.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.345
Zoinks! It's the snow ghost!

09:13.595 --> 09:17.766
Do not be alarmed.
It is only the white timber wolf.

09:21.645 --> 09:24.690
- White timber wolf?
- Yes. He's my friend.

09:25.107 --> 09:27.943
I feed him, and he protects me.

09:28.444 --> 09:32.114
- All he wants is his bone.
- Bone?

09:40.748 --> 09:44.209
I have a hunch this snow ghost
is after something besides you.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.171
And we're gonna find out what it is.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.718
Do you believe that story
Mr. Chi told us?

09:53.051 --> 09:55.679
Well, right now,
it's the only story we have.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.807
Hey, wait a minute. Stop!

10:00.142 --> 10:02.644
There's some more
of the snow ghost footprints.

10:03.020 --> 10:07.274
And look.
They're covered with sawdust.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.652
Sawdust? Maybe he works
in a meat market.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.451
Where there's sawdust,
there's usually a sawmill.

10:17.910 --> 10:23.165
And I'll bet that's where we'll
find those footprints came from.

10:28.212 --> 10:32.716
Wow. This place looks more
like a scare mill than a sawmill.

10:32.883 --> 10:36.637
It's probably been deserted
for at least 100 years.

10:36.887 --> 10:39.890
And I'm for keeping it deserted.
Let's get out of here!

10:40.057 --> 10:41.225
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

10:41.391 --> 10:44.353
Not before we get to the bottom
of this mystery.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.314
Let's split up and search this place.

11:02.538 --> 11:05.582
Come on, you scaredy-cats!

11:13.757 --> 11:18.262
Oh, Scooby! That's just your
reflection in a broken mirror.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.972
Huh?

11:30.399 --> 11:31.984
Velma?

11:32.150 --> 11:33.443
Yipe!

11:34.444 --> 11:38.031
Shaggy? Velma?! Shaggy?!

11:47.499 --> 11:49.376
Scooby! Help!

11:49.543 --> 11:51.461
Velma!

11:57.634 --> 12:00.721
Quick, Scooby! Cut the chain!

12:04.182 --> 12:05.976
Get a bigger saw!

12:13.859 --> 12:14.902
Yipe!

12:29.750 --> 12:32.419
- Scooby!
- Uh-oh.

12:33.295 --> 12:37.049
- Quick, make like a beaver!
- Beaver?

12:46.224 --> 12:48.018
You did it, Scooby!

12:50.187 --> 12:51.980
Scooby Doo!

12:54.816 --> 12:56.234
Yipe!

13:03.325 --> 13:05.494
Help! Help!

13:19.549 --> 13:22.511
Hey! Give me back my glasses.

13:22.678 --> 13:25.806
- Yipe! Dynamite!
- Dynamite?

13:47.869 --> 13:52.582
After Scooby picked the lock on
the chains, we came right back here.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.752
Now all we have to do is find Shaggy.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.506
It's Shaggy!

13:59.798 --> 14:03.135
He's been turned into a ghost
by the snow ghost.

14:05.721 --> 14:07.389
Shaggy!

14:13.854 --> 14:15.230
Shaggy!

14:18.483 --> 14:21.653
Hey! Shaggy's not a ghost anymore.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.239
- I'm not?
- What happened?

14:24.614 --> 14:29.244
I don't know. All I remember is fainting
at the sight of Mr. Hairy-Scary...

14:29.411 --> 14:31.830
and waking up as a goony ghost.

14:32.164 --> 14:36.585
You must have been sprayed with some
white stuff, and the water washed it off.

14:36.877 --> 14:40.881
Wait a minute. If the snow ghost
didn't turn you into a ghost...

14:41.048 --> 14:45.677
- maybe he's not a ghost, either.
- Then he must be for real.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.266
Run, everybody!

14:56.855 --> 14:57.898
Oops!

14:58.065 --> 15:00.942
- Like, thanks a lot.
- Sorry.

15:20.837 --> 15:24.341
Keep running!
He's right behind us.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.429
Quick! Duck behind those logs.

15:40.649 --> 15:44.903
- Well, we lost him.
- Yeah, but we lost Daphne too.

15:46.238 --> 15:50.158
- I'm in here.
- Hey! A secret hollow log.

15:50.492 --> 15:53.662
That's not all that's in here. Look.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.664
Diamonds! And jewelry!

15:56.039 --> 15:58.375
But what are they doing
hidden in that log?

15:58.542 --> 16:04.005
I think I'm beginning to figure out
this kooky deep-freeze mystery.

16:04.256 --> 16:08.885
While you put two and two together,
we better find Shaggy and Scoob.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.364
Zoinks! That creep never gives up.

16:36.496 --> 16:40.375
Scooby, this is no time
to be a backseat driver.

16:49.009 --> 16:53.305
Hurry! Turn left! Turn right!
He's right behind us!

16:57.934 --> 17:00.312
Now he's in front of us!

17:07.110 --> 17:10.405
- Head for the ice, Scooby!
- Ice? Ice!

17:14.910 --> 17:16.453
"Dan...

17:16.786 --> 17:18.580
Dan... ger.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.207
Danger.

17:20.916 --> 17:23.001
Danger. Thin ice."

17:29.925 --> 17:33.178
Wouldn't you know it,
we're frozen like a couple of icicles.

17:33.511 --> 17:36.556
But at least we're safe
from that creepy snow ghost.

17:46.358 --> 17:49.069
We're on a ski jump!

17:50.153 --> 17:52.530
Quick! Make like a bird.

18:00.538 --> 18:04.668
Lucky we found you. You would've
been stuck till the spring thaw.

18:05.043 --> 18:08.296
I'd rather be stuck here
than with that snow ghost.

18:08.463 --> 18:11.967
Speaking of that snow ghost,
what are we gonna do?

18:12.133 --> 18:15.595
Catch him. This quick-freeze
worked on Shaggy and Scooby.

18:15.762 --> 18:19.724
- Maybe it'll work on him. Come on!
- Huh?

18:20.976 --> 18:23.520
- All set, Scooby?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

18:23.770 --> 18:26.523
Okay. When we lure
the ghost past here...

18:27.023 --> 18:30.402
you take the lid off the bucket
and dump the water on him.

18:30.568 --> 18:34.406
- He'll freeze into an ice block.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

18:34.864 --> 18:37.492
And just to make sure
you don't miss...

18:37.659 --> 18:40.120
here's a couple of Scooby snacks.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.086
Scooby Doo!

19:08.732 --> 19:10.483
Zoinks! It's the snow ghost!

19:10.817 --> 19:14.237
And he's trying to throw
Scooby off the ledge!

19:28.668 --> 19:31.171
I'II save you, Scoob!

19:42.098 --> 19:44.559
- Be careful!
- Gangway!

19:44.726 --> 19:47.270
Look out! Watch it!

19:55.195 --> 19:57.238
Mr. Greenway!

19:57.947 --> 20:01.618
Have I got a headache.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.329
I've got to hand it to you kids.

20:04.454 --> 20:08.208
You've uncovered one of the biggest
rings ofjewel thieves in the country.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.919
Those two were the masterminds
of the ring.

20:11.378 --> 20:16.299
Leach over here would bring the stolen
jewels to Greenway in a suitcase.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.426
Greenway sent them down the river...

20:18.593 --> 20:21.846
and across the border,
hidden in these hollowed-out logs.

20:22.263 --> 20:26.476
To scare people away, he
disguised himself as the snow ghost.

20:26.643 --> 20:30.522
He got the idea when Fu Ian Chi
told him that wild story.

20:30.688 --> 20:33.608
Yeah. He even made it look
like he could fly.

20:34.025 --> 20:37.987
- How did he do that?
- Transparent plastic skis.

20:38.154 --> 20:43.034
They're almost impossible to see
at night. Show him, Scooby.

20:46.913 --> 20:50.917
- Yay! Yay, Scoob!
- Attaboy, Scoob!

20:51.084 --> 20:53.086
Scooby Doo!

20:54.796 --> 20:56.256
Scooby Doo.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.262
Scooby Doo!

21:19.946 --> 21:21.114
Huh?
