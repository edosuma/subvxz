WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.583
And that, my friends, is the
incredible story of the day

00:03.583 --> 00:06.458
I thought I found
a dragon fossil

00:06.458 --> 00:09.875
but it just turned out
to be an old rock.

00:13.125 --> 00:14.833
Any questions?

00:14.833 --> 00:16.000
Yes.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.833
How is it possible that
you and I are related?

00:18.833 --> 00:21.333
Alex, this is
"Show and Tell,"

00:21.333 --> 00:23.500
an exercise that requires
we all be supportive

00:23.500 --> 00:25.416
of what one another brings in.

00:25.416 --> 00:28.250
And I brought in
a fuzzy squirrel frog.

00:28.250 --> 00:31.375
What kind of thoughtless fool
brings that?!

00:31.375 --> 00:34.416
You're still the most supportive
teacher I've ever had.

00:34.416 --> 00:37.458
Whatever you do, just keep
that thing locked up.

00:37.458 --> 00:39.583
Fuzzy squirrel frogs
eat human toes.

00:39.583 --> 00:41.875
So, if you guys don't mind,
I'm gonna teach class

00:41.875 --> 00:43.708
sitting criss-cross
applesauce.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.875
Take a knee, delinquents.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.250
Oh, we have a visitor.

00:52.250 --> 00:55.250
- How you doing,
sweater vest?
- Hi.

00:55.250 --> 00:57.750
The name is Penny Nichols
from WizTech.

00:57.750 --> 01:00.166
I'm here to inform you
that you're all required

01:00.166 --> 01:02.000
to perform a wand drill.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Ooh, a wand drill.
This sounds like fun.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.708
A wand drill is
a choreographed routine

01:09.708 --> 01:12.416
of wand-twirling
and spell-casting

01:12.416 --> 01:15.250
in order to instill...
teamwork.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.208
It takes discipline,

01:17.208 --> 01:18.583
coordination,

01:18.583 --> 01:22.458
and the grace of a gazelle.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.208
Watch and learn.

01:24.208 --> 01:25.958
Ooh!

01:25.958 --> 01:28.166
Ahh!

01:33.000 --> 01:34.583
Ta-da.

01:36.625 --> 01:39.083
I'm sorry, I don't think I'm
gonna be able to do that.

01:39.083 --> 01:41.125
It's a little too...
what's the word?

01:41.125 --> 01:42.291
Exercise-y.

01:44.583 --> 01:47.708
Well, all members
of the class

01:47.708 --> 01:50.458
have to participate
in order to pass.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.958
And if you do pass,
well, then, you graduate

01:52.958 --> 01:54.625
from this
Delinquent Studies class

01:54.625 --> 01:57.875
and go right back
into WizTech.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.875
Oh, here's the information

02:01.875 --> 02:03.833
they'll be
expected to know.

02:03.833 --> 02:06.625
I hope three days is
long enough to prepare,

02:06.625 --> 02:08.875
'cause that's all
I'm giving you.

02:08.875 --> 02:11.416
Bye-bye!

02:11.416 --> 02:13.750
Did you guys hear that?
If we pass the wand drill,

02:13.750 --> 02:16.291
I'll have successfully
graduated all of you.

02:16.291 --> 02:18.166
You and I might have
enough points to get back
in the wizard competition.

02:18.166 --> 02:19.166
Connecting the dots.

02:20.958 --> 02:22.416
It doesn't even
look that hard.

02:22.416 --> 02:24.750
- It's just this
little pamphlet.
- Yeah.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.375
- OK.
- Mmm.

02:26.375 --> 02:28.750
A little bit.
It's... oh.

02:30.208 --> 02:32.458
OK.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.166
More.

02:34.166 --> 02:37.166
All right, this is gonna
take me like three days

02:37.166 --> 02:39.625
- to just close up.
- OK.

02:39.625 --> 02:41.583
Don't worry about it, guys.
Do not worry.

02:41.583 --> 02:44.458
We will hunker down,
immerse ourselves
in the material.

02:44.458 --> 02:47.375
With the right amount
of determination
and concentration,

02:47.375 --> 02:49.583
there is nothing
that can stand in our way.

02:50.583 --> 02:53.583
Excuse me.

02:53.583 --> 02:55.416
Is this Justin Russo's class?

02:55.416 --> 02:58.083
I'm Rosie, your new student.

02:58.083 --> 03:01.458
All right, everyone,
let's drop everything
and get to know Rosie.

03:07.375 --> 03:13.708
♪ Everything is not
what it seems ♪

03:13.708 --> 03:15.625
♪ Well, you know everything's

03:57.583 --> 04:00.000
But you can see how it
looks like a dragon fossil.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.416
It does.

04:01.416 --> 04:02.833
You know, you should
put it on a chain

04:02.833 --> 04:05.291
and make it a necklace
for someone special.

04:05.291 --> 04:08.291
That is a great idea.

04:08.291 --> 04:11.875
And, uh... think I have
that special person in mind.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.000
Is it me, Mr. Justin?

04:16.750 --> 04:18.833
Justin, can you please focus?

04:18.833 --> 04:20.166
We have a lot of work
to do here.

04:20.166 --> 04:22.083
Right, right.
The wand drill.

04:22.083 --> 04:23.583
We'll get back to
that later, Rosie.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.250
In the meantime,
I will tell you

04:25.250 --> 04:27.500
the same thing I tell
all my new students:

04:27.500 --> 04:30.291
I am currently single
and I occasionally say

04:30.291 --> 04:32.833
very romantic things
off the top of my head.

04:32.833 --> 04:34.958
What was that noise?

04:34.958 --> 04:37.458
Did it sound like the beating
wings of a majestic bird?

04:37.458 --> 04:39.208
'Cause it was probably
my heart.

04:39.208 --> 04:42.083
- Oh, that was romantic.
- Yeah.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.833
But no, I'm pretty sure
that was the sound

04:43.833 --> 04:45.458
of a fuzzy squirrel frog.

04:45.458 --> 04:47.166
Yep, it's mine.
He got out.

04:47.166 --> 04:49.833
All right, nobody panic.
Nobody panic.

04:49.833 --> 04:51.583
We are all gonna be calm
and handle this...

04:51.583 --> 04:53.833
There it is! Run!

04:56.000 --> 04:58.458
All right, guys.
Take a look around

04:58.458 --> 05:00.250
and tell me what's wrong.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.625
Oh! The menu has
a bunch of typos.

05:02.625 --> 05:05.833
There's a really
confusing subway theme.

05:05.833 --> 05:08.333
The napkins are from
Bill's Szechuan Buffet.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.708
No, no! Hello!

05:10.708 --> 05:12.750
We don't have any customers.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.458
We need to figure out a way

05:14.458 --> 05:16.458
to get people to buy
our sandwiches.

05:16.458 --> 05:17.875
Have you considered
buying fresher

05:17.875 --> 05:20.250
and better-tasting
ingredients?

05:22.333 --> 05:24.166
Hey, you guys...

05:24.166 --> 05:26.000
Maybe the answer's
right in front of us.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.083
We need to figure out a way

05:28.083 --> 05:31.250
to exploit Max's
new cute face

05:31.250 --> 05:32.958
to get people to buy
our sandwiches.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.875
I mean,
look at this face!

05:36.875 --> 05:38.875
Jerry, if cuteness
was all it took

05:38.875 --> 05:40.416
to run a successful restaurant,

05:40.416 --> 05:43.583
I think I would have
capitalized on that by now.

05:45.416 --> 05:48.291
Well, what about
offering punch cards?

05:48.291 --> 05:50.583
Buy 9 sandwiches,
get the tenth one free.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.500
Oh, yeah.
I got one of those
at the video store,

05:53.500 --> 05:56.208
but I always lose it before
I get anything for free.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.875
We're doing that.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.833
Yes! Harper,
you design the punch card

06:05.833 --> 06:09.375
and we can publish it in
next week's Waverly Weekly.

06:09.375 --> 06:12.875
As long as you keep
my disgusting cute face
out of this.

06:12.875 --> 06:15.416
Honey, you know
what's not cute?

06:15.416 --> 06:18.333
People talking about
their own cuteness.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.875
Can you believe her?

06:23.583 --> 06:25.125
For the next part
of the drill,

06:25.125 --> 06:26.583
we will continue
the same steps

06:26.583 --> 06:29.166
and we will pass an object
magically back and forth.

06:29.166 --> 06:32.375
For convenience, we will use
the lamp from the living room.

06:32.375 --> 06:34.833
Yeah? That'll be nice.

06:36.333 --> 06:38.208
All right.

06:38.208 --> 06:39.833
Begin.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.458
OK, good. Focus,
pass it off to Alex.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.416
Alex, good job.

06:44.416 --> 06:46.833
Felix. Look at that
wrist technique.

06:46.833 --> 06:48.875
Good job. Focus,
pass it off to Rosie.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.500
Sorry, guys,
that was my fault.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.250
Again.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.875
It's OK. We do not
assign blame in my class.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.333
Besides, it was
Felix's fault.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.500
What? I didn't even
pass it to her.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.416
It's this guy's fault!

07:06.333 --> 07:08.333
I don't want to
let you down.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.500
You could not let me down.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.000
The only way you
could let me down

07:12.000 --> 07:13.625
is if I let you
let me down,

07:13.625 --> 07:16.375
and I will not
let you let me down.

07:19.166 --> 07:21.416
Excuse me, family time.

07:21.416 --> 07:24.083
What is the matter with you?
Can you stop focusing on Rosie

07:24.083 --> 07:25.250
and get back on
the wand drill?

07:25.250 --> 07:27.250
I am not focusing on Rosie.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.583
Hi.

07:31.291 --> 07:33.458
It might surprise you, Alex,
but I am capable of treating

07:33.458 --> 07:36.166
a very, very beautiful woman
in the exact same way

07:36.166 --> 07:38.125
that I treat the rest
of you ordinary people.

07:40.833 --> 07:43.583
You're doodling her name
on your clipboard.

07:43.583 --> 07:45.583
Yeah, because she's new.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.208
That's how you
remember her name.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.000
OK, well, Nelvis
is new, too.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.458
Why aren't you
doodling his name?

07:50.458 --> 07:51.875
- Who?
- Nelvis.

07:51.875 --> 07:53.333
He started today, too.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.708
You didn't notice me

07:55.708 --> 07:58.708
because I came in behind
the really hot girl.

08:00.458 --> 08:01.708
I know the new kid.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.875
You stop looking at her.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.166
Justin, wha...

08:16.166 --> 08:18.166
What are you doing?

08:18.166 --> 08:20.125
Making a necklace for Rosie.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.000
Like I do for all
my new students.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.416
Really?

08:25.416 --> 08:26.875
Where's the one for Nelvis?

08:28.833 --> 08:31.000
Right here.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.500
Nelvis loves salt.

08:33.958 --> 08:36.750
Well, I'm sure Rosie
will love the necklace

08:36.750 --> 08:38.833
when you give it to her
as a going away present,

08:38.833 --> 08:40.583
because you have to
kick her out.

08:40.583 --> 08:41.833
Kick her out?

08:41.833 --> 08:43.708
We're never gonna
pass this wand drill

08:43.708 --> 08:45.750
if she's in it.
And you're so gaga over her

08:45.750 --> 08:48.000
that you can't see
she's bringing us down.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.500
- Give her the bootski.
- I'm not giving her
the bootski, OK?

08:52.500 --> 08:55.458
All she needs is a little
one-on-one help.

08:55.458 --> 08:56.875
All right?
I'll work with her.

08:56.875 --> 08:59.083
And who's gonna
work with us?

08:59.083 --> 09:00.875
You're gonna throw
everything away

09:00.875 --> 09:03.625
that we've been working
so hard on to get back
in the competition

09:03.625 --> 09:05.583
for some girl that you
barely even know.

09:05.583 --> 09:07.250
I know her.

09:07.250 --> 09:08.291
Good.

09:08.291 --> 09:10.083
'Cause I have no idea
who you are.

09:16.458 --> 09:18.166
Ooh, look,
we have a customer!

09:18.166 --> 09:20.708
Hello, welcome to
the Waverly Sub Station.

09:20.708 --> 09:22.416
- May we help you?
- You sure can.

09:22.416 --> 09:23.708
I'll take a
Number Four sandwich,

09:23.708 --> 09:25.500
then you can punch this card.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.583
- Number Four coming up!
- Well, that didn't take long.

09:28.583 --> 09:31.416
These punch cards
are a great idea, Harper.

09:31.416 --> 09:34.000
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.708
Thank you.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.625
Oh, I sure hope I don't
lose my punch card

09:37.625 --> 09:39.500
before I get
my free sandwich.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.708
You could only hope.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.125
Yes!

09:46.125 --> 09:48.750
Why didn't we think about
doing this years ago?

09:48.750 --> 09:50.708
This is so much better
than those flyers

09:50.708 --> 09:52.416
you left on all those cars.

09:52.416 --> 09:54.958
I didn't know it was
a junkyard.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.458
Oh, no, he's back.

10:01.458 --> 10:03.708
The complaint box
is over there.

10:03.708 --> 10:05.250
No, I'm here for
my free sandwich.

10:05.250 --> 10:07.166
My card is completely punched.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.083
That's impossible.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.583
You were just here
a minute ago with
only one punch.

10:11.583 --> 10:15.125
Sorry, that doesn't
ring a bell.

10:15.125 --> 10:17.750
You punched these out yourself
to get a free sandwich.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.875
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.833
Here you go, sir.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.583
Thanks, cutie.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.000
Call me that again,
and your card

10:27.000 --> 10:28.875
won't be the only thing
that gets punched.

10:38.375 --> 10:41.375
Oh, Justin.
I love it.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.291
This is so sweet of you.

10:43.291 --> 10:47.250
Right, well, don't be thrown
when I give one to Nelvis.

10:47.250 --> 10:48.583
I kind of have to.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.500
I think I'm the one
that should be
giving you something

10:52.500 --> 10:54.958
for helping me
with this wand drill.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.000
Right. Right.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.291
- Well, let's...
let's get to it then.
- OK.

11:01.291 --> 11:05.166
Just you and I in here
with no distractions.

11:05.166 --> 11:08.375
OK, uh... Quick!

11:08.375 --> 11:09.875
Levitate this vase.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.291
It was in the air longer
than the last one.

11:18.291 --> 11:20.125
I'm so sorry, Justin.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.958
No, it's OK.

11:21.958 --> 11:23.750
Let's try something
a little simpler.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.708
How about you make
this mess disappear?

11:26.708 --> 11:29.333
OK, uh...
A disappearing spell.

11:29.333 --> 11:32.166
That's right.
This one is so easy,
I do it in my sleep.

11:32.166 --> 11:34.458
Sometimes I wake up,
and my alarm clock's gone!

11:35.333 --> 11:37.875
I can't do it.

11:37.875 --> 11:40.625
You didn't even say
the disappearing spell.

11:40.625 --> 11:42.333
You were standing there
fanning me.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.000
You have to say words, too?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.083
Oh, my gosh.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.208
Look, look, uh...

11:50.208 --> 11:51.875
Rosie, I'm sorry,
but I don't think

11:51.875 --> 11:53.833
this extra help
is gonna work out.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.708
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave my class.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.000
What?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.875
I'm sorry.

12:00.875 --> 12:02.583
It's just...

12:02.583 --> 12:05.083
This test is really important.

12:05.083 --> 12:07.625
It wouldn't be fair
to the rest of my students...

12:07.625 --> 12:09.083
...if you stayed here.

12:10.708 --> 12:12.625
OK.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.833
I guess this is goodbye.

12:16.458 --> 12:18.000
OK, let's just
make it quick.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.416
Which is gonna be impossible,

12:20.416 --> 12:21.875
because you don't know
how to flash out.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.000
Just stop.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.250
Listen up, everyone.

12:50.250 --> 12:53.458
I would like to inform you
that Rosie is no longer
in our class.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.583
I asked her to leave,
since she was gonna

12:55.583 --> 12:57.250
keep you guys
from moving forward.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.583
That's the kind of
hard decision

12:59.583 --> 13:02.250
that a strong leader
is willing to make.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.291
Excuse me.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.083
I have to leave because...

13:06.083 --> 13:07.583
...I have something in my eye.

13:09.833 --> 13:12.458
Thanks for the
salt shaker necklace.

13:14.458 --> 13:17.166
Aw, man, Mr. Justin's in
no condition to help us.

13:17.166 --> 13:20.166
We should just quit.
Ah, yeah, that feels right.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.458
Now, now...

13:22.458 --> 13:26.291
Now, normally,
I would be all for
giving up without a fight,

13:26.291 --> 13:28.875
but this wand drill
is too important.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.583
Come on, Alex.

13:30.583 --> 13:32.875
How's a rag-tag
team of misfits like us

13:32.875 --> 13:34.416
expected to beat the odds?

13:36.458 --> 13:38.333
Know what you guys need?

13:38.333 --> 13:40.583
An inspirational speech.

13:43.291 --> 13:44.291
OK.

13:44.291 --> 13:48.125
We can succeed
without Justin.

13:48.125 --> 13:50.625
Hey, if we believe
in each other,

13:50.625 --> 13:53.583
we can accomplish anything
we set our minds to.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.875
So I say,
fellow delinquents:

13:56.875 --> 14:00.958
We... can... do it.

14:00.958 --> 14:02.500
I think.

14:04.458 --> 14:07.458
We... can...
do it, I think.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.958
We... can...
do it, I think.

14:09.958 --> 14:12.375
We can
do it, I think!

14:12.375 --> 14:14.625
Yeah! I think.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.333
All right, everybody,
let's get our free sandwiches

14:20.333 --> 14:22.625
in an orderly fashion.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.375
Excuse me.

14:24.375 --> 14:26.708
We haven't seen any of you
in this restaurant before,

14:26.708 --> 14:29.125
so there's no way
you guys could have
bought the 9 sandwiches

14:29.125 --> 14:30.458
required to get a free one.

14:30.458 --> 14:32.083
And guess what?

14:32.083 --> 14:33.583
We changed our promotion.

14:33.583 --> 14:35.583
Yeah, you have to buy
10 sandwiches

14:35.583 --> 14:37.416
to get the 11th one
for free.

14:39.375 --> 14:40.458
Oh, come on!

14:40.458 --> 14:42.375
We want our free sandwiches!

14:42.375 --> 14:46.375
Jerry!
They're gonna bankrupt us.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.458
I mean, I knew it
could happen eventually,

14:48.458 --> 14:51.000
but I figured
the Health Department
would shut us down first.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Max, this is all your fault.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.458
If you'd only let your father

14:54.458 --> 14:56.416
exploit your
obnoxiously cute face,

14:56.416 --> 14:57.708
we wouldn't be in this mess.

14:57.708 --> 15:01.416
Fine. I'll save your butts
with my face.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.708
Oh, my gosh.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.625
People are taking
free sandwiches

15:12.625 --> 15:14.708
from my mommy and daddy.

15:14.708 --> 15:17.416
What's going to happen to me?

15:17.416 --> 15:20.125
I won't have money for school

15:20.125 --> 15:24.208
or books or...
bows for my hair!

15:24.208 --> 15:25.458
Aww!

15:25.458 --> 15:29.250
No bows for this
cute little girl?

15:29.250 --> 15:30.291
Ohh!

15:30.291 --> 15:32.833
We can't take advantage
of this place.

15:32.833 --> 15:35.250
Come on, let's go to
the frozen yogurt shop.

15:35.250 --> 15:39.083
If we buy a cup, we can sit at
the topping bar and eat all day.

15:39.083 --> 15:40.333
Thank you.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.125
Thank you!

15:42.125 --> 15:44.583
Oh.

15:44.583 --> 15:47.416
Thank you, Max.

15:47.416 --> 15:49.125
That could have been
a disaster.

15:49.125 --> 15:52.125
I think we all learned a
very valuable lesson today.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.958
Yes, we did.

15:53.958 --> 15:56.875
We buy one yogurt,
you can feed the whole family.

15:56.875 --> 15:59.375
Grab your coats!
Come on.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.333
Ready, go!

16:03.333 --> 16:06.083
Together.
Nice, point.

16:06.958 --> 16:10.708
Good. Good,
and... shimmer.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.458
Yes, we did it!

16:12.458 --> 16:16.500
You're my new Mr. Justin,
but pretty.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.958
Aww.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.625
Hey, guys.

16:21.625 --> 16:24.458
I want to wish you luck
on your wand drill.

16:24.458 --> 16:28.000
I'm sure Justin told you,
but he kicked me out of class

16:28.000 --> 16:31.166
because he doesn't think
I'm good enough.

16:37.625 --> 16:40.000
'Kay, bye!

16:42.000 --> 16:44.625
This is the part where
you're supposed to tell me

16:44.625 --> 16:47.583
that I wasn't that bad
to spare my feelings.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.958
Who wants a sandwich?

16:50.958 --> 16:53.333
- I do!
- Yeah, great.

16:54.875 --> 16:58.416
Rosie, wait.
Sorry, nothing personal.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.416
To be honest,
I'm kind of surprised

17:00.416 --> 17:02.166
my brother kicked you
out of the class.

17:02.166 --> 17:05.583
Can you give this
back to him?

17:05.583 --> 17:09.958
He made it for me.
He's so sweet.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.208
Wait, you like him back?

17:14.333 --> 17:15.958
Yeah.

17:15.958 --> 17:18.583
I mean, I came here
expecting to find a teacher,

17:18.583 --> 17:22.458
and instead I found this
really sweet, smart guy

17:22.458 --> 17:24.458
who I would love
to get to know better.

17:25.583 --> 17:30.125
But I guess it's
not meant to be.

17:31.875 --> 17:34.125
Wait.

17:35.708 --> 17:38.708
Look...

17:38.708 --> 17:41.208
I'm the one
who pressured him

17:41.208 --> 17:42.500
into kicking you out
of the class,

17:42.500 --> 17:45.708
because we really had to
pass this wand drill.

17:45.708 --> 17:49.083
And I thought it was
either/or, but...

17:49.083 --> 17:50.875
...maybe it's not.

17:50.875 --> 17:53.583
What are you saying?

17:55.083 --> 17:56.500
I'm gonna help you.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.416
- Oh!
- Oh, OK.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.291
OK, so the wand drill test
is about to start.

18:07.291 --> 18:08.958
I'm gonna use
the copycat spell,

18:08.958 --> 18:11.333
and it'll make you do
everything that I do.
We'll totally pass the test.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.583
This, that, copycat.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.708
Did it work?
Yep, it worked.

18:21.708 --> 18:24.708
It's probably better
if we don't talk
when we get in there.

18:30.625 --> 18:33.291
Rosie?
What are you doing here?

18:33.291 --> 18:38.250
Justin, relax.
Everything's fine.
Just go with it.

18:39.291 --> 18:41.625
That was so weird.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.833
Wand drill time, ladies.

18:46.833 --> 18:49.625
Now, show me what you got

18:49.625 --> 18:51.958
so I can tell you
what you don't got.

19:06.291 --> 19:08.750
I can't believe it.
Your knuckleheads

19:08.750 --> 19:11.583
are actually pulling off
a Blooming Orchid.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.958
Quite a breathtaking
beginning, Justin.

19:34.875 --> 19:37.750
This ragtag group of misfits

19:37.750 --> 19:40.958
is displaying discipline
and teamwork?

19:40.958 --> 19:44.625
I am almost... moved.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.333
Thank you, Penny.

19:46.333 --> 19:48.958
That's what happens when a
strong leader is in charge.

19:48.958 --> 19:50.958
I mean, I don't want to
toot my own horn or anything,

19:50.958 --> 19:54.250
but "toots mcgoots."

19:56.166 --> 19:57.500
What was that?

19:57.500 --> 20:00.500
That was me tooting
my own horn. Yeah.

20:02.208 --> 20:05.875
Alex! The fuzzy squirrel frog's
on your foot!

20:05.875 --> 20:08.708
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

20:08.708 --> 20:10.458
What are they doing?

20:10.458 --> 20:12.375
Is that supposed to be
part of the routine?

20:12.375 --> 20:15.083
Yeah. Yeah, it's all
part of the routine.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.708
Felix, it's a part
of the routine.

20:16.708 --> 20:18.083
Guys, start doing
what they're doing.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.375
Do everything
they're doing, OK?

20:19.375 --> 20:21.458
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

20:21.458 --> 20:22.958
Get it off me!

20:22.958 --> 20:24.583
Alex, it's on your back!

20:31.000 --> 20:34.208
She's an angel.

20:34.208 --> 20:38.583
Oh, my gosh.
She's an angel.

20:38.583 --> 20:41.083
Not this nor that,
no copycat.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.416
That was me who said,

20:45.416 --> 20:47.416
"Oh, my gosh,
she's an angel,"
by the way.

20:47.416 --> 20:51.583
Justin, I am so sorry
I didn't tell you before.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.291
I pretended to be a wizard
just so that I could meet you.

20:54.291 --> 20:57.166
I heard about what
a great guy you are,

20:57.166 --> 21:00.000
and I just wanted you
to accept me as a person

21:00.000 --> 21:01.458
instead of an angel.

21:01.458 --> 21:04.958
I'm so glad
you came back.

21:04.958 --> 21:07.458
Justin, I really like you.

21:07.458 --> 21:10.875
Huh?! I really like you, too.

21:11.958 --> 21:14.875
Yeah, hi. Uh...

21:16.208 --> 21:19.125
You two lovebirds almost done,

21:19.125 --> 21:22.375
because that routine
was a mess.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.708
You all fail!

21:29.458 --> 21:33.958
That's what we get for
bringing the hot girl back.

21:38.375 --> 21:41.083
Oh, my gosh!
There's a fuzzy frog squirrel!

21:45.958 --> 21:47.875
What a faker.

21:47.875 --> 21:49.708
She wasn't faking!

21:53.583 --> 21:58.000
Felix, guys...
I'm sorry.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.458
It's just not a lot of girls
like my brother,

22:01.458 --> 22:04.000
so I felt like I had to
give him a shot.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.375
I didn't think I'd
ruin it for all of you.

22:06.375 --> 22:07.708
Eh, it's all right.

22:07.708 --> 22:09.625
We're pretty used to
failing by now.

22:09.625 --> 22:11.208
Plus, he's dating an angel.

22:11.208 --> 22:13.166
That's like dating
a supermodel with wings.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.208
I can't believe any of this.

22:17.208 --> 22:19.583
Like... it feels like a dream,

22:19.583 --> 22:21.416
like someone should pinch me.

22:22.708 --> 22:25.333
Ow! Nelvis!
