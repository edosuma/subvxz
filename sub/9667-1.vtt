WEBVTT

00:00.054 --> 00:02.578
What are you doing, Dube?

00:02.657 --> 00:05.592
The lieutenant, sir,
he wants to see the guest list.

00:08.696 --> 00:11.859
- Go and get these boys some more beer.
- Thirsty, boy? You like beer?

00:11.933 --> 00:13.264
Thank you.

00:16.171 --> 00:17.502
Come with me, please.

00:22.143 --> 00:24.304
Sir, that was two weeks ago.

00:29.584 --> 00:31.074
Here you are, sir.

00:33.988 --> 00:36.354
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier...

00:37.725 --> 00:39.215
What is this?

00:42.163 --> 00:43.653
It is the guest list, sir.

00:44.666 --> 00:46.759
Are you trying to make a fool of me?

00:46.834 --> 00:51.931
No. We stopped taking names
after the president was murdered.

00:52.006 --> 00:55.498
- This is the only guest list, sir.
- There are no Europeans left!

00:56.611 --> 01:00.945
Get me the names
of all the cockroaches in there now.

01:01.849 --> 01:04.784
- That will take time.
- We don't have time.

01:04.852 --> 01:09.551
If I don't have the names
so that I can pick out the traitors,

01:09.624 --> 01:12.457
then I'll kill everyone in there.

01:13.962 --> 01:15.452
Starting with you.

01:16.231 --> 01:17.755
Leave.

01:20.168 --> 01:21.226
Yes, sir.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.481 --> 01:34.880
Yes, sir.

01:35.550 --> 01:36.710
Who did you call?

01:37.885 --> 01:40.217
- Who did I call?
- Don't lie to me!

01:42.624 --> 01:44.615
What is your name?

01:44.692 --> 01:47.024
Rusesabagina.

01:48.129 --> 01:50.063
Paul Rusesabagina.

01:50.565 --> 01:52.430
I'll remember you.

01:53.701 --> 01:55.100
I'll remember you.

01:56.070 --> 01:59.801
- Let's go.
- Come on, we're leaving.

02:09.350 --> 02:10.339
They've gone.

02:13.688 --> 02:15.087
Paul. Paul.

02:17.759 --> 02:19.750
I was afraid for you.

02:21.095 --> 02:24.758
Sir, the president of Sabena
is on the phone for you.

02:26.134 --> 02:28.068
I must talk with this man.

02:33.908 --> 02:36.638
- Mr. Tillens.
- Paul, what's going on?

02:36.711 --> 02:40.044
They left. Thank you, sir.
What did you do?

02:40.114 --> 02:43.208
I got through to the French
president's office.

02:45.453 --> 02:47.785
Well, thank you.
You have saved our lives.

02:48.623 --> 02:53.253
I pleaded with the French and
the Belgians to go back and get you all.

02:54.195 --> 02:56.823
I am afraid this is not
going to happen.

02:58.499 --> 03:00.990
They're cowards, Paul.

03:01.903 --> 03:05.634
Rwanda is not worth
a single vote to any of them.

03:07.041 --> 03:09.976
The French, the British,
the Americans.

03:11.079 --> 03:12.740
I am sorry, Paul.

03:15.016 --> 03:16.108
Thank you.

03:19.754 --> 03:21.381
There will be no rescue...

03:22.824 --> 03:24.815
...no intervention for us.

03:26.361 --> 03:28.693
We can only save ourselves.

03:29.897 --> 03:32.058
Many of you know
influential people abroad.

03:32.133 --> 03:33.623
You must call these people.

03:33.701 --> 03:36.727
Please, fax this
to this number. Thank you.

03:36.804 --> 03:39.534
You must tell them
what will happen to us.

03:41.209 --> 03:42.699
Say good-bye.

03:45.646 --> 03:47.409
But when you say good-bye,

03:47.482 --> 03:52.647
say it as though you are reaching
through the phone and holding their hand.

03:53.554 --> 03:56.250
Let them know that
if they let go of that hand...

03:58.359 --> 03:59.849
...you will die.

04:03.197 --> 04:06.928
We must shame them
into sending help.

04:09.370 --> 04:14.330
Most importantly,
this cannot be a refugee camp.

04:14.409 --> 04:18.505
The Interhamwe believe that the
Mille Collines is a four-star Sabena hotel.

04:18.579 --> 04:22.276
That is the only thing
that is keeping us alive.

04:22.350 --> 04:24.284
Have you printed the bills?

04:25.787 --> 04:28.278
Thank you.
Now please erase the register.

04:28.356 --> 04:31.382
- Erase it?
- Yes. I want no names to appear there.

04:32.093 --> 04:34.061
Boss, the carpenters are ready.

04:34.128 --> 04:36.858
Tell them to remove
all of the numbers from the doors.

04:36.931 --> 04:38.956
- And put what?
- And put nothing.

04:46.808 --> 04:49.470
Good day.
Here is your bill for the last week.

04:49.544 --> 04:52.206
If you cannot pay
or think you will not be able to pay,

04:52.280 --> 04:55.681
please go to the banquet room and
Dube will take care of you. Thank you.

04:59.821 --> 05:02.289
Does the State Department
have a view

05:02.356 --> 05:06.554
as to whether or not
what is happening could be genocide?

05:06.627 --> 05:10.028
We have every reason to believe
that acts of genocide have occurred.

05:10.097 --> 05:14.830
How many acts of genocide
does it take to make genocide?

05:14.902 --> 05:17.928
Alan, that's just not a question
that I'm in a position to answer.

05:18.005 --> 05:21.566
Is it true that you
have specific guidance

05:21.642 --> 05:24.133
not to use the word "genocide"
in isolation,

05:24.212 --> 05:26.806
but always to preface it
with this word "acts of"?

05:28.349 --> 05:33.412
I have guidance
which I try to use as best as I can.

05:33.488 --> 05:35.046
I have...

05:35.122 --> 05:37.556
There are formulations
that we are using

05:37.625 --> 05:40.617
that we are trying to be
consistent in our use of...

05:43.231 --> 05:45.028
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.

05:46.133 --> 05:47.794
As long as it is scotch.

05:50.104 --> 05:53.835
Your white friends
have abandoned you.

05:55.576 --> 05:58.238
- So it would seem.
- Well, don't worry.

05:58.312 --> 06:01.611
- I will take care of you.
- I'm glad to hear that

06:01.682 --> 06:04.617
because I was wondering if perhaps
you could spare us a few policemen.

06:04.685 --> 06:05.879
To protect us, sir.

06:05.953 --> 06:08.945
- The police are very busy, Paul.
- Yes, I'm aware of this.

06:09.023 --> 06:12.288
But when I last spoke
to the president of Sabena,

06:12.360 --> 06:15.761
he assured me that anyone
who helped protect Belgian property

06:15.830 --> 06:17.320
would be well rewarded.

06:18.332 --> 06:19.663
I will see what I can do.

06:20.835 --> 06:22.496
Excuse me momentarily, sir.

06:24.238 --> 06:26.001
Where has all our beer gone?

06:27.008 --> 06:29.738
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beer.

06:30.444 --> 06:31.843
How much beer?

06:32.780 --> 06:33.872
Many.

06:37.251 --> 06:40.186
...come down to the reception.
And then he says to me,

06:40.254 --> 06:41.881
"How do you want the girls?"

06:43.858 --> 06:46.793
There's our cockroach manager.
Always kissing ass.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.660
General...

06:55.403 --> 06:57.132
I'm glad you came by.

06:57.905 --> 07:00.373
I overheard something
that I think you should know about.

07:00.441 --> 07:01.669
What did you overhear?

07:01.742 --> 07:06.008
It was a discussion between a U.N. Colonel
and an American Embassy official.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.479
And what did they say?

07:07.548 --> 07:10.381
The American assured the colonel
that they would watch everything.

07:10.451 --> 07:12.009
How? They have gone, Paul.

07:12.086 --> 07:15.180
With their spies. Satellites.

07:17.692 --> 07:19.523
Americans.

07:19.594 --> 07:21.494
Oh, Gregoire!

07:25.299 --> 07:27.199
You know, I admire you, General.

07:27.902 --> 07:30.700
How do you keep command
of your men amid such madness?

07:30.771 --> 07:34.537
- I am a strong man, Paul.
- I wish I were more like you.

07:35.476 --> 07:37.842
- I mean, look at my staff.
- Cheers.

07:37.912 --> 07:40.574
He won't work,
listens to no one.

07:40.648 --> 07:43.242
- He is staff?
- Oh, yes.

07:43.317 --> 07:44.306
Yes.

07:55.062 --> 07:57.223
Get back to work, you slug! Go!

07:58.599 --> 08:00.032
Satellites?

08:01.202 --> 08:04.694
What was I going to say, that
the Americans were hiding in the trees?

08:16.751 --> 08:20.551
- What's the matter?
- I have to go out and get food.

08:20.621 --> 08:24.557
- Go out? Where?
- To George Rutaganda's place.

08:24.625 --> 08:26.752
No. No, no.

08:26.827 --> 08:28.658
I have to, Tatiana.

08:28.729 --> 08:31.357
We are only as valuable
as the money we give to him.

08:31.432 --> 08:33.092
You cannot go alone.

08:33.967 --> 08:37.631
I'm not going alone.
I'll take Gregoire with me.

08:37.705 --> 08:40.936
He's a good Hutu,
and he wants to impress me now.

08:50.785 --> 08:52.946
It is good to see you
back at work, Gregoire.

08:53.020 --> 08:56.080
- Please, sir, accept my humblest apologies.
- Please, please.

08:56.957 --> 08:58.788
We have a job this morning.

08:58.859 --> 09:01.191
We are going
to see George Rutaganda.

09:02.263 --> 09:03.594
Please get the van.

09:23.350 --> 09:24.840
Show me your I.D.

09:24.919 --> 09:27.410
Remember how those Tutsi women
used to look down

09:27.488 --> 09:30.514
their long noses at Hutu men?
Now they beg for their lives.

09:30.591 --> 09:33.116
I'm here to see my friend
George Rutaganda.

09:33.194 --> 09:37.563
I say taste those
Tutsi whores before they die.

09:37.631 --> 09:41.158
Then they'll know
what Hutu power is, my warriors.

09:41.235 --> 09:45.001
Remember, one cockroach
can start an infestation.

09:45.072 --> 09:47.540
We need to exterminate these vermin.

10:18.272 --> 10:20.638
Hey, Paul, my old friend.

10:24.078 --> 10:28.037
Tutsi prostitutes and witches.
So, what can I do for you?

10:28.783 --> 10:31.377
- I need supplies, George.
- Anytime.

10:36.457 --> 10:40.052
Paul, everything is double the price now.
You understand that?

10:40.127 --> 10:43.290
Yes. I need rice, beans,

10:43.364 --> 10:46.765
powdered milk, beer,
and your best whiskey.

10:47.935 --> 10:51.427
Beer yes, but whiskey no.

10:51.505 --> 10:53.063
You have no whiskey?

10:53.140 --> 10:55.836
No whiskey, no spirits.

10:55.910 --> 11:00.643
Your... rich guests will have to do
without their scotch.

11:01.248 --> 11:04.740
Anyway, Paul,
I have bled that cow enough now.

11:05.853 --> 11:07.377
What are you saying, George?

11:07.454 --> 11:13.051
Your rich cockroaches at the hotel,
their money is no good to them anymore.

11:13.894 --> 11:16.124
Soon all the Tutsis will be dead.

11:18.699 --> 11:21.964
You do not honestly believe
that you can kill them all?

11:23.337 --> 11:24.736
And why not?

11:26.373 --> 11:27.965
Why not?

11:28.042 --> 11:30.533
We are halfway there already.

11:33.347 --> 11:36.214
So, Paul, you want
12 bags of rice?

11:37.418 --> 11:40.012
Give him 12 bags of rice
and 4 crates of beer.

11:40.087 --> 11:41.577
Yes, sir, right away.

11:43.123 --> 11:48.925
Oh, and, Paul, I'll give you a crate
of soft drinks for the kids free of charge.

11:50.431 --> 11:51.523
Yes.

11:53.267 --> 11:55.997
Ten bags of beans.
Come, quick.

11:56.637 --> 11:59.162
And put those in the van. You.

12:00.774 --> 12:02.765
Let me give you
a little tip, my friend.

12:02.843 --> 12:05.573
Our generals in army say,
"Don't go near the Mille Collines

12:05.646 --> 12:07.841
or they will send
the Belgian soldiers back here."

12:07.915 --> 12:12.181
But soon those generals will
have gone and we will be in charge.

12:13.420 --> 12:17.652
It's time to butcher that fat cow
of yours for the meat.

12:28.569 --> 12:29.968
Let's go.

12:32.907 --> 12:34.898
Maybe you could help us, Paul.

12:34.975 --> 12:37.842
You have some very important
traitors at that hotel.

12:38.512 --> 12:40.343
Now, if we were to get them,

12:40.414 --> 12:44.214
then maybe we would let you have
one or two cockroaches of your own.

12:46.153 --> 12:47.552
Do you understand?

12:49.590 --> 12:52.423
It is almost dawn, George.

12:52.493 --> 12:54.586
We really must be going.

12:56.363 --> 12:59.560
Take the river road back.
It's clear.

13:21.255 --> 13:23.849
- Gregoire.
- What is going on now?

13:23.924 --> 13:26.154
- You've driven off the road.
- No, I'm on the road.

13:26.226 --> 13:29.059
You're going to put us in the river.
Stop the car, stop the car.

14:53.614 --> 14:55.309
Back up the car, Gregoire.

14:57.217 --> 14:58.377
Listen to me.

14:59.987 --> 15:03.150
You will tell no one
what you have seen here today.

15:03.223 --> 15:04.622
No one, Gregoire.

15:20.941 --> 15:24.934
Dube. Please help Gregoire
to unload the van. Thank you.

15:59.279 --> 16:00.678
Oh, dear.

16:32.813 --> 16:34.075
Oh, God!

16:37.284 --> 16:38.512
Oh, God!

16:39.720 --> 16:41.051
- Sir.
- Dube!

16:41.121 --> 16:44.989
- Sir, are you okay?
- Don't come in. Don't come in.

16:45.058 --> 16:47.049
I'll be out in a minute.

16:48.328 --> 16:51.161
- Sir, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right, Dube.

16:52.065 --> 16:53.862
Don't come in. I'll be out.

17:28.167 --> 17:29.430
Hundreds.

17:32.172 --> 17:34.265
It was too many to count.

17:37.811 --> 17:40.279
Why are people so cruel?

17:44.251 --> 17:45.411
Hatred.

17:46.887 --> 17:48.718
Insanity. I don't know.

17:54.428 --> 17:55.452
There you go.

17:55.529 --> 17:57.827
Is she putting
her fingers in the soup?

17:57.898 --> 17:59.798
Oh, yes.

18:00.968 --> 18:03.459
...to do with you.
Nothing to do with me.

18:03.537 --> 18:04.936
I remember...

18:06.039 --> 18:07.768
No, no, no, you make a mistake.

18:07.841 --> 18:09.536
- Hello.
- Come with me.

18:11.545 --> 18:13.479
- Where are we going?
- Just come.

18:30.330 --> 18:31.661
It's beautiful.

18:33.667 --> 18:34.929
You like it?

18:44.411 --> 18:46.811
I hear we must pay for everything.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.370
Yes, this is true.

18:49.683 --> 18:53.175
So... how much for this?

18:55.188 --> 18:56.678
A kiss.

19:08.535 --> 19:13.370
You are a good man,
Paul Rusesabagina.

19:30.057 --> 19:31.649
I have a confession.

19:33.727 --> 19:35.718
When you worked as the nurse...

19:35.796 --> 19:37.957
- In Ruhengeri?
- Yes.

19:38.031 --> 19:40.056
When we first met...

19:41.635 --> 19:44.126
I had you transferred to Kigali.

19:46.473 --> 19:47.804
What?

19:48.775 --> 19:53.269
I bribed the Minister of Health
to have you transferred to Kigali.

19:55.148 --> 19:57.742
- Why?
- To be closer.

19:59.219 --> 20:00.948
So that I could marry you.

20:07.627 --> 20:08.958
What was the bribe?

20:11.765 --> 20:14.928
- What am I worth to you?
- It was substantial.

20:15.001 --> 20:17.834
- Tell me what it was.
- A car.

20:19.940 --> 20:22.773
- What sort of car?
- What does that matter?

20:22.843 --> 20:24.708
I want to know.

20:26.279 --> 20:27.871
A Volkswagen.

20:32.886 --> 20:34.217
I hope it was a new one.

20:59.312 --> 21:02.475
We have had a good life,
you and I. Yes.

21:05.452 --> 21:10.048
I thank God every day
for the time we've had.

21:16.096 --> 21:19.998
- We have to have a plan.
- A plan?

21:21.868 --> 21:24.860
Our children cannot
see us die first.

21:24.938 --> 21:28.339
If the militia come, you must
come up here as quick as you can.

21:28.408 --> 21:31.070
- Please, I don't want to...
- You must come up here, Tatiana.

21:31.144 --> 21:34.079
- I don't want you to talk like this, please.
- We have to, Tatiana.

21:35.882 --> 21:38.282
If I do not make it,

21:38.351 --> 21:41.149
you must take all of our children
by the hand...

21:42.923 --> 21:44.254
...and you must jump.

21:46.326 --> 21:49.659
- What are you saying? I could never...
- You have to, Tatiana.

21:49.729 --> 21:52.493
- You have to promise me.
- What are you saying?

21:52.566 --> 21:55.865
Tatiana, the machete is no way to die.
You have to promise me you will do it.

21:55.936 --> 21:57.665
I cannot do...

21:57.737 --> 22:00.501
You have to
promise me, Tatiana. Please.

22:00.574 --> 22:02.166
Promise me you will do it.

22:05.812 --> 22:07.643
Please, Tatiana.

22:10.784 --> 22:11.944
Yes.

22:14.788 --> 22:16.517
I'm sorry. I love you.

22:18.258 --> 22:19.589
I love you.

22:27.467 --> 22:28.957
I'm gonna get you!

22:30.403 --> 22:32.394
Diane, Elys, you know better.

22:32.472 --> 22:34.997
No one can be at the front
of the hotel. I have told you this.

22:35.075 --> 22:37.373
- Take these children in the back. Hurry.
- Sorry, Papa.

22:38.578 --> 22:40.409
- Come, children. Come.
- Thank you, Dube.

22:43.149 --> 22:46.380
Paul, I've got good news.

22:49.389 --> 22:53.120
Congratulations.
Your calls have worked.

22:53.193 --> 22:56.993
I have exit visas
for the following families.

22:57.063 --> 23:00.260
Abukesu, Tanzania.

23:00.333 --> 23:03.325
Bidori, Kenya.

23:05.238 --> 23:07.331
Gituaranga, Zambia.

23:07.407 --> 23:09.170
Hallelujah!

23:09.242 --> 23:10.903
Khalesa, Belgium.

23:10.977 --> 23:12.137
Oh, thank you!

23:13.313 --> 23:14.712
Dakuzi...

23:16.283 --> 23:17.545
Kenya.

23:18.418 --> 23:21.182
Masambo, Zambia.

23:22.422 --> 23:24.754
Zinguru, Ghana.

23:24.824 --> 23:27.884
Rusesabagina, Belgium.

23:29.162 --> 23:30.629
All right, that's it.

23:32.098 --> 23:35.090
So remember,
families be ready at 7 a.m.

23:35.168 --> 23:36.430
Let's go.

23:36.503 --> 23:37.561
- Colonel?
- Yeah.

23:38.638 --> 23:40.833
Now, certainly Odette
and Jean Baptiste are on the list.

23:40.907 --> 23:43.740
I'm sorry, Jean, Odette.

23:44.911 --> 23:48.472
But I have been assured
there will be another plane soon.

23:48.548 --> 23:49.537
Excuse me.

23:52.052 --> 23:55.112
Don't worry, Tatsi,
we'll make it to the next list.

23:55.188 --> 23:56.177
Yeah.

23:57.791 --> 24:00.726
The girls...
Paul, I will not leave without them.

24:10.737 --> 24:12.068
What have you brought us?

24:12.138 --> 24:15.471
Antibiotics, medical supplies,
general first aid.

24:15.542 --> 24:17.032
Thank you.

24:17.110 --> 24:19.601
- I hear there's to be a convoy.
- Yes.

24:19.679 --> 24:21.408
Are you on the list?

24:24.884 --> 24:29.617
Madame Archer, I have
an impossible request of you.

24:30.590 --> 24:33.855
Is there any way that you
could return to the old woman

24:33.927 --> 24:35.918
and bring the girls
back here to us?

24:35.996 --> 24:39.955
Paul, that side of town has been
destroyed in the fighting.

24:40.900 --> 24:42.231
They're probably dead.

24:45.305 --> 24:48.638
Madame Archer, I'm begging you.
Those girls have no one now.

24:52.412 --> 24:53.902
I'll try.

24:55.048 --> 24:57.141
We have to leave by 7 a.m.

24:57.651 --> 24:59.744
Who'll take care
of the orphans when you're gone?

24:59.819 --> 25:03.482
Odette. Odette will care for them
until we can get them out of here.

25:07.694 --> 25:11.687
Tell me, Paul, what country's
gonna take 20 Rwandan orphans?

25:11.765 --> 25:15.496
I will find someone.
I promise you.

25:17.737 --> 25:19.864
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

25:27.380 --> 25:28.779
Come on, take my hand.

25:29.382 --> 25:32.715
News Service Africa.
Today a Red Cross representative

25:32.786 --> 25:35.346
claimed that the death rate
in the Rwandan conflict

25:35.422 --> 25:38.983
may have climbed to as many
as 500,000 victims.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.459
One report stated
that 40,000 bodies

25:41.528 --> 25:43.758
had been removed
from Lake Victoria.

25:45.632 --> 25:46.656
Where is she?

25:46.733 --> 25:50.499
I don't know.
We wait until seven.

25:50.570 --> 25:52.970
If she is not back
with the girls by then...

25:54.340 --> 25:55.830
...she may not be coming.

25:58.645 --> 25:59.634
Thank you.

25:59.713 --> 26:01.943
Please, take these letters.

26:02.015 --> 26:04.279
Yes, I will take your letters.

26:04.350 --> 26:06.818
Thank you so much, Paul,
taking the letter.

26:08.354 --> 26:11.187
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, I am sorry.

26:11.257 --> 26:12.417
Thank you very much.

26:12.492 --> 26:15.256
I am sorry. I wish I could
have done more. I am sorry.

26:17.564 --> 26:19.395
God be with you.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.963
- Yes, do you have any children?
- Yes, you're clear to go.

26:25.305 --> 26:27.136
No, sorry, no good.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.006
Come. Come, children.

26:30.076 --> 26:31.805
Tatsi, come.

26:33.680 --> 26:36.012
Please, Paul, the girls.
We wait a little longer.

26:36.082 --> 26:38.073
We cannot wait.
We cannot wait, Tatsi.

26:38.151 --> 26:39.140
There you go.

26:39.786 --> 26:41.117
Let's move out!

26:44.824 --> 26:46.155
Good luck, sir.

26:57.570 --> 27:02.166
I am not leaving. You hold Tatiana.
Take care of my family.

27:08.348 --> 27:09.838
Paul. Paul!

27:11.017 --> 27:14.509
I cannot leave these people to die.
I cannot leave these people.

27:14.587 --> 27:15.849
Papa!

27:15.922 --> 27:18.891
Roger! Roger, I will follow
on the next flight.

27:18.958 --> 27:21.722
No, don't leave me! Paul!

27:21.795 --> 27:25.253
Don't worry. Don't worry, children.
Your father's going to be okay.

27:25.331 --> 27:26.355
Papa!

27:26.432 --> 27:30.198
- Don't worry. He's okay.
- I want Papa!

27:30.270 --> 27:31.737
It's okay.

27:57.263 --> 28:00.596
I say those Hutus
who shelter the cockroaches

28:00.667 --> 28:02.999
are the same as cockroaches.

28:05.138 --> 28:07.003
- They are all the same.
- This is crazy.

28:07.073 --> 28:11.134
Their fate should be the same.
This is RTLM.

28:22.188 --> 28:26.352
The Tutsi cockroaches
of the rebel army must be denied recruits.

28:26.426 --> 28:30.021
Come on, good Hutus.
The graves are not yet full.

28:30.096 --> 28:32.963
- Who will help us fill them?
- That goddamn radio station.

28:34.067 --> 28:37.332
Okay. Yeah, they are
going to the airport.

28:40.907 --> 28:44.934
Stand by your radios.
I am hearing some urgent news.

28:46.145 --> 28:49.239
- Boss! Please, come quick!
- Not now, Dube.

28:49.315 --> 28:52.284
It is important! It is on the radio.
You have to hear it.

28:53.653 --> 28:56.918
We have received reports
of very important cockroaches

28:56.990 --> 29:00.824
and traitors trying to escape
from the Mille Collines Hotel.

29:00.894 --> 29:02.418
Gather up your weapons.

29:02.495 --> 29:05.658
Stand by your radios.
We will keep you informed.

29:05.732 --> 29:08.963
- They are being smuggled away...
- No, no! Who told them of this, Dube?

29:09.035 --> 29:12.300
I saw Gregoire, sir. It is Gregoire.
I saw him leaving in our bus.

29:21.881 --> 29:24.372
Please, sir,
I will give you whatever I have.

29:24.450 --> 29:27.010
I say who leaves that hotel,
and no one else.

29:29.455 --> 29:32.356
General Bizimungu,
they are driving into an ambush.

29:52.779 --> 29:53.939
Slow down.

29:55.815 --> 29:57.407
Stay calm.

29:58.017 --> 29:59.917
- What is happening?
- We're stopping.

30:02.088 --> 30:04.318
You have got cockroaches
in these trucks.

30:04.390 --> 30:06.756
No, no. I've got
U.N. Personnel in these trucks.

30:06.826 --> 30:09.056
I've got permission to go
through these roadblocks.

30:09.128 --> 30:12.461
- I'm going to search these trucks.
- You are not going to search this convoy.

30:14.100 --> 30:16.227
- I am.
- Cover me.

30:23.276 --> 30:24.766
Go to the back.

30:30.783 --> 30:34.412
Get away from that truck.
Get away from that truck! Now!

30:43.997 --> 30:46.124
Get back!
You're not to hurt these people.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.190
Get back! Move back!

30:49.869 --> 30:52.269
Look, I told you,
you've got cockroaches in your truck.

30:52.338 --> 30:56.001
No, no, no. They're political refugees
under U.N. Sanction.

30:59.612 --> 31:03.776
News has come to us
that we have cowards in our own army

31:03.850 --> 31:06.011
who will not let us punish them.

31:09.188 --> 31:10.177
No!

31:12.291 --> 31:14.282
You're moving cockroaches
from Mille Collines?

31:14.360 --> 31:16.828
No, sir. No, sir,
they're political refugees.

31:16.896 --> 31:19.956
- They cannot leave Mille Collines.
- They are not leaving.

31:20.833 --> 31:21.857
Stop him!

31:24.237 --> 31:25.602
You bastard!

31:31.377 --> 31:32.435
What's your name?

31:32.512 --> 31:34.878
- What's your name?
- I can't think...

31:35.681 --> 31:38.650
- Kill them!
- Get everybody out of here! Move it!

31:38.718 --> 31:41.551
What's your name?
What's your name?

31:42.155 --> 31:43.486
Let's move! Drive!

31:43.556 --> 31:45.319
Move! Get out!

31:45.391 --> 31:46.881
Out, or I'll shoot!

31:50.129 --> 31:51.118
Get out!

31:54.901 --> 31:56.493
Drive, drive! Let's go!

31:57.437 --> 31:59.428
Help us get out of here.

31:59.505 --> 32:01.268
Clear the street!

32:10.917 --> 32:13.579
I am receiving more news,
good Hutus.

32:13.653 --> 32:17.487
I have learned that
the traitor Rusesabagina's cockroaches

32:17.557 --> 32:18.956
are on a truck.

32:19.025 --> 32:21.255
10,000 francs for their heads!

32:23.529 --> 32:26.191
Stay still.
Give me your shirt, quickly.

32:35.775 --> 32:37.766
Come on, Paul.
Come on, come on!

32:37.844 --> 32:40.870
Come on, here, here.
Give me your hand. Come on.

32:43.416 --> 32:44.713
Please, please.

32:44.784 --> 32:47.617
- Hey, medic. Get a medic over here!
- You need to hurry up, please.

32:47.687 --> 32:49.416
Come, hurry, hurry.

32:52.291 --> 32:54.725
- Let me help you.
- Someone give this guard a hand, please.

32:57.697 --> 32:59.187
Oh, Tatiana, my darling.

33:02.268 --> 33:04.463
- I was so worried about you.
- Move that truck out of the way!

33:04.537 --> 33:05.526
Get him inside!

33:06.339 --> 33:08.500
Tatiana. Tatiana.

33:09.842 --> 33:12.333
You left me.
You left me.

33:12.411 --> 33:14.504
Take this. I don't want it.
I don't want it.

33:14.580 --> 33:17.378
You said you'd never leave me,
and you left me. You are a liar!

33:19.619 --> 33:21.746
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

33:21.821 --> 33:23.618
- I'm sorry.
- Papa, Papa.

33:23.689 --> 33:26.590
- Papa, Mama!
- I love you.

33:35.234 --> 33:37.998
I wanted you to be safe,
all of you.

33:38.871 --> 33:41.533
That was not
your decision to make.

33:41.607 --> 33:45.043
We make our decisions together.
That was our promise.

33:45.111 --> 33:46.806
You're right.

33:46.979 --> 33:48.913
You're right.

33:48.981 --> 33:51.882
I knew that the minute
the truck pulled away.

33:51.951 --> 33:53.350
I'm sorry.

33:53.686 --> 33:54.880
Come on, put some more water.

33:54.954 --> 33:56.512
What are they doing?

33:57.623 --> 33:59.147
Dube.

33:59.926 --> 34:03.589
I'm sorry, sir. They shut down
the water. This is all we have.

34:10.136 --> 34:11.797
General.

34:11.871 --> 34:13.338
Where are my supplies?

34:14.172 --> 34:16.072
I'm sorry, sir.
The cellar is empty.

34:16.141 --> 34:21.205
You have nothing, and yet
you call me, begging me for help?

34:21.280 --> 34:23.612
Do you know the trouble I have
protecting these cockroaches?

34:23.683 --> 34:25.981
Sir, I have money from the guests.

34:26.052 --> 34:27.985
Rwandan francs!

34:28.955 --> 34:31.116
Those are only good
for wiping your ass.

34:32.692 --> 34:34.819
There is nothing more
I can do for you, Paul.

34:34.893 --> 34:37.556
No more police,
no more protection.

34:38.931 --> 34:41.797
Let the U.N. Take care of you.

34:44.737 --> 34:46.466
Drive. Go!

34:53.045 --> 34:55.172
What would Sabena make of this?

35:02.989 --> 35:04.081
Watch out!

35:10.062 --> 35:11.586
Get down, get down!

35:16.135 --> 35:18.399
Are you hurt?
Go outside.

35:18.471 --> 35:20.996
Please stay still.
There's glass here. I will get it out.

35:21.073 --> 35:22.802
Is anyone hurt, Odette?

35:22.875 --> 35:25.002
Lots of cuts and bruises.

35:31.484 --> 35:33.349
Thank God it was a storeroom.

35:35.288 --> 35:38.223
And in Rwanda,
humanitarian agencies report

35:38.291 --> 35:40.816
that a rapid advance
by the Tutsi rebel army

35:40.893 --> 35:44.761
has sparked a mass evacuation
of Hutu refugees towards the Congo.

35:44.830 --> 35:46.991
One aid worker described it

35:47.066 --> 35:50.092
as the largest refugee exodus
in modern history.

35:50.169 --> 35:51.864
The rebels have taken half the city,

35:51.937 --> 35:56.135
and they have proposed a deal
the Hutu generals are willing to accept.

35:57.043 --> 36:00.069
The rebels will exchange
their Hutu prisoners,

36:00.146 --> 36:01.977
and you people,
all of you,

36:02.048 --> 36:05.415
will be able to move
behind the rebel lines where it's safe.

36:05.484 --> 36:07.543
The Interhamwe, what about them?

36:07.620 --> 36:10.953
- No one controls them.
- This time they will kill us all.

36:11.023 --> 36:13.423
They will kill us all if we stay here.

36:14.093 --> 36:15.822
We have to take the chance.

36:16.762 --> 36:18.753
What time should we
be ready to leave?

36:19.699 --> 36:21.792
I can put it together
in two days, Paul.

36:21.867 --> 36:23.129
Two days?

36:23.969 --> 36:26.699
Colonel, there is no way that we
can hold out for two days.

36:26.772 --> 36:28.569
I have nothing left
to bribe them with.

36:30.109 --> 36:34.170
Colonel, we will
all be dead in two days.

36:57.803 --> 37:00.966
Diane... let your mother rest.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.372
You rest too, sweetheart.
Go to sleep.

37:12.218 --> 37:13.446
Diplomat.

37:15.454 --> 37:16.512
What?

37:17.423 --> 37:19.357
I have to go to the Diplomat.

37:29.668 --> 37:32.535
- What are you doing?
- We have to go to the Diplomat.

37:32.605 --> 37:35.130
- To do what?
- Your items, they are there.

37:36.575 --> 37:39.066
Will you please put your
policemen at the gate, sir?

37:39.145 --> 37:42.046
No. Let us see
what you have to offer first.

37:53.492 --> 37:55.653
Oh, no. Madame Archer.

38:13.512 --> 38:14.501
Move, move!

38:19.952 --> 38:21.283
- Cover us.
- Yes, sir.

38:21.353 --> 38:22.342
Hurry!

38:26.692 --> 38:27.989
Come on, show me.

38:37.203 --> 38:40.036
Look at this.
Nice, yes?

38:40.806 --> 38:42.137
And here you are.

38:48.948 --> 38:51.508
The rebels are
getting closer, yes?

38:52.384 --> 38:54.909
The rebels can have this graveyard.

38:54.987 --> 38:57.319
We have ordered everyone
out of the city.

39:00.059 --> 39:01.219
Here.

39:02.328 --> 39:03.556
Have a drink.

39:10.336 --> 39:12.327
You know what
the Scottish call it?

39:12.404 --> 39:13.894
No.

39:15.741 --> 39:19.142
Uisge beatha... water of life.

39:25.351 --> 39:31.290
I went once on a tour of the finest
single malt distillery in the world.

39:32.157 --> 39:35.092
- Have you ever been to Scotland?
- No, sir.

39:36.228 --> 39:37.718
Wonderful country.

39:38.464 --> 39:40.056
Wonderful golf.

39:41.300 --> 39:44.394
I wonder, will I ever go back?

39:46.038 --> 39:47.300
What do you think?

39:48.674 --> 39:49.834
No.

39:51.443 --> 39:54.435
I hope we all get to do
a great many things, General.

39:55.948 --> 39:57.506
Can we go now,
please, sir?

39:59.251 --> 40:01.913
I am going to do you
a great favor, Paul.

40:02.021 --> 40:03.955
- Private.
- Yes, sir!

40:04.023 --> 40:07.220
Pack those carefully,
put them in my jeep, and guard them.

40:07.993 --> 40:12.521
I am going to take you with us
to our new headquarters in Gitarama.

40:13.299 --> 40:15.392
I do not want to go
to Gitarama, sir.

40:15.467 --> 40:18.129
Well, you can't go back
to the hotel.

40:18.203 --> 40:20.034
The crazy men are
on their way there now.

40:20.105 --> 40:25.509
Sir... General, we must go back
so that I can get my family.

40:25.578 --> 40:28.706
Trust me,
we are better off here.

40:28.781 --> 40:33.650
General, these are difficult times.

40:33.719 --> 40:35.516
We need to help one another.

40:35.588 --> 40:38.921
And what help can I get
from you, Paul?

40:38.991 --> 40:42.427
- You are a marked man, sir.
- How so?

40:42.494 --> 40:46.294
You are on a list. The Americans
have you on their list as a war criminal.

40:46.365 --> 40:49.357
Paul, I am sick and tired
of your lies.

40:49.435 --> 40:52.199
Are you stupid, General?

40:52.271 --> 40:54.466
How do you think
these people operate?

40:54.540 --> 40:59.000
You sit here with five stars on your chest.
Who do you think they are coming after?

41:03.616 --> 41:04.776
Fine.

41:06.185 --> 41:10.121
We will go to Gitarama,
and you will stay on that list.

41:10.189 --> 41:14.091
- I committed no war crimes.
- Who will tell them?

41:14.159 --> 41:17.094
You need me to tell them
how you helped at the hotel.

41:17.162 --> 41:20.393
They blame you for all their misfortunes.
They say you led the massacres.

41:20.466 --> 41:21.956
I led no massacres!

41:22.034 --> 41:23.968
Do you think they're
going to believe you?

41:24.036 --> 41:25.560
You will tell them the truth!

41:25.638 --> 41:27.833
I will tell them nothing
unless you help me.

41:29.675 --> 41:32.109
What are you going to do,
shoot me?

41:34.146 --> 41:35.477
Shoot me.

41:36.115 --> 41:38.242
Please shoot me.
It would be a blessing.

41:38.317 --> 41:41.650
I will pay you to shoot my family.

41:42.655 --> 41:43.986
You cannot hurt me.

41:44.056 --> 41:47.617
You will tell them
that I did nothing!

41:50.362 --> 41:53.229
We are leaving.
Right now.

42:02.074 --> 42:04.042
Get out!

42:06.345 --> 42:08.404
Get these people
away from the gate!

42:14.253 --> 42:16.312
Stop it! Stop it!

42:16.989 --> 42:18.320
Clear the hotel.

42:19.091 --> 42:21.252
- Tatiana!
- Get out of here!

42:21.326 --> 42:22.725
- Get out!
- Tatiana!

42:23.529 --> 42:24.791
Get out!

42:26.165 --> 42:29.794
All of the militia
must leave now! Get out!

42:51.390 --> 42:52.550
Oh, no, no!

42:52.624 --> 42:54.114
Shut up, cockroach!
Get down!

42:56.628 --> 42:58.493
That's him. That's him!

42:59.631 --> 43:01.758
- Shit.
- That's the manager!

43:01.834 --> 43:05.099
- Stop him. Stop him!
- I got him! I got him!

43:16.381 --> 43:18.406
Stay where you are!

43:35.400 --> 43:37.027
Tatiana!

43:38.337 --> 43:40.066
Tatiana!

43:46.044 --> 43:48.308
- Have you seen Tatiana?
- No, I've not seen Tatiana.

43:48.380 --> 43:50.871
- Paul, what is happening?
- I have to find my wife!

43:53.185 --> 43:54.311
Tatiana!

43:58.323 --> 43:59.483
Tatiana!

44:26.251 --> 44:28.014
They've gone. They've gone.

44:30.355 --> 44:31.344
They've gone.

44:36.261 --> 44:38.252
What were you
going to do with this?

44:47.973 --> 44:49.907
I thought you had...

44:49.975 --> 44:51.772
I thought you had jumped.

45:03.956 --> 45:06.117
Everyone on the trucks, please.

45:06.191 --> 45:08.955
Take your luggage.
Families please stay together.

45:09.027 --> 45:11.894
- Oh, please.
- As fast as you can, everyone. Please.

45:11.964 --> 45:14.398
There's enough room for everyone.

45:17.703 --> 45:19.568
I hope someday we will come back.

45:20.806 --> 45:22.000
Let's move out.

45:32.050 --> 45:34.143
What is wrong with her?

45:34.820 --> 45:36.913
She has a very high fever.

45:44.730 --> 45:47.198
Where are we going, Daddy?

45:47.266 --> 45:48.893
Someplace safe.

46:46.692 --> 46:47.920
My God.

47:10.315 --> 47:11.907
What's happening?

47:36.708 --> 47:39.905
Come on, let's go. Children on the ground.
Bring the children this way.

47:39.978 --> 47:42.242
Pass them back, pass them back.

47:48.320 --> 47:51.483
Do not stop. Do not stop!
Go right on through.

48:03.869 --> 48:05.302
Get down!

48:08.006 --> 48:09.132
Stay down!

48:32.664 --> 48:34.154
What's happening there?

48:37.669 --> 48:41.161
It's the rebels.
We're crossing the front line.

48:42.140 --> 48:44.904
It's okay. We're safe.

48:44.976 --> 48:46.102
It's okay.

48:46.178 --> 48:48.169
It's okay, you are safe here.
You are safe.

48:48.246 --> 48:51.875
It's okay now.
Sit back down.

48:53.652 --> 48:54.812
Hello.

49:25.517 --> 49:27.348
Get some more water.

49:28.620 --> 49:31.612
The doctor says he is
very dehydrated.

49:31.690 --> 49:34.215
We made it.
Come on, let's get down.

49:35.560 --> 49:37.391
- Come on.
- It is okay.

49:37.462 --> 49:39.191
- She is sick.
- Okay.

49:40.165 --> 49:41.632
Yeah, she's very sick.
Take her.

49:44.069 --> 49:48.403
Paul, the buses are
on the other side of camp.

49:48.473 --> 49:50.839
They'll take you to Tanzania.

49:50.909 --> 49:54.709
Go now, Paul, 'cause I don't know
when there'd be another opportunity.

49:54.779 --> 49:56.110
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

49:56.181 --> 49:58.411
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

50:01.386 --> 50:03.377
- Thank God.
- We made it.

50:03.455 --> 50:06.015
Please, please.
We are here, yeah?

50:06.091 --> 50:07.718
- Thank you, Paul.
- We have made it.

50:07.792 --> 50:09.783
- Thank you.
- Yes, yes. Come.

50:10.262 --> 50:11.251
Mr. Manager.

50:11.329 --> 50:13.729
- I just want to thank you.
- Of course, Steven.

50:13.798 --> 50:14.890
Constance!

50:15.834 --> 50:18.598
Thank God you are alive!
It's so good to see you.

50:18.670 --> 50:21.161
Have you seen my brother
and his wife?

50:21.239 --> 50:22.399
None of them.

50:23.175 --> 50:25.666
Has anyone seen these people?
You don't recog...

50:25.744 --> 50:28.076
Mama, come see quick.

50:28.146 --> 50:30.614
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Can you see them anywhere?

50:32.617 --> 50:34.209
Here, Mama, look.

50:34.286 --> 50:35.548
Please.

50:37.189 --> 50:40.454
Do you see them, Mama?
Is that them?

50:41.159 --> 50:42.956
Is that them, Mama?

50:44.296 --> 50:46.389
Do you recognize these people?

50:46.464 --> 50:49.592
This little girl, she's Anais,
and this is Carine.

50:49.668 --> 50:51.158
Do you recognize them?

50:52.904 --> 50:56.601
- Ma'am, have you seen these girls?
- No, no, I haven't.

50:56.675 --> 50:58.836
Have any of you seen these girls?

51:01.279 --> 51:03.975
Anais. And that's my brother.

51:04.049 --> 51:06.040
Everybody on the buses!

51:14.793 --> 51:16.818
Can you feel anything
when I touch here?

51:16.895 --> 51:18.920
Everybody on the buses!

51:18.997 --> 51:21.591
Can you move out of the way?
We need some room here!

51:21.666 --> 51:24.999
- We'll find the girls, Tatsi. We will.
- Okay.

51:28.940 --> 51:30.567
Boussey?

51:30.642 --> 51:31.973
It's you.

51:35.046 --> 51:36.536
Where'd you find this child?

51:36.615 --> 51:38.947
They just arrived
on trucks from the Mille Collines.

51:41.152 --> 51:45.088
All Mille Collines evacuees
to the buses now, please.

51:45.156 --> 51:47.147
- Oh, no.
- We need to hurry up, please.

51:53.531 --> 51:55.863
Come on, get some sleep.

51:57.068 --> 51:58.194
Wait!

52:07.846 --> 52:09.677
Hold it, please!

52:12.450 --> 52:14.145
- Tatiana!
- It's Pat!

52:14.219 --> 52:16.687
- Tatiana!
- Madame Archer!

52:16.755 --> 52:19.485
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus, stop the bus!

52:19.557 --> 52:20.717
Come. Come, come.

52:21.593 --> 52:23.288
Please, wait for us.

52:23.361 --> 52:26.194
Madame Archer.
I was so worried. I thought...

52:27.432 --> 52:29.366
It's wonderful to see you.

52:29.434 --> 52:30.867
Come quickly.

52:38.310 --> 52:40.676
- Carine?
- Anais?

52:40.745 --> 52:41.973
Anais?

52:42.047 --> 52:44.743
Just wait. It's gonna be
just a minute now.

52:46.651 --> 52:49.085
Anais? Carine?

53:03.768 --> 53:05.759
Oh, my God!

53:07.072 --> 53:09.097
Oh, my God!

53:09.174 --> 53:11.108
Come, come, come!

53:14.646 --> 53:18.582
Hello, Carine. Anais, hello.
How are you, sweetheart?

53:20.919 --> 53:22.580
Do you see your cousins?

53:30.428 --> 53:32.794
They said there wasn't any room.

53:32.864 --> 53:34.525
There's always room.
