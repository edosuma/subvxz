00:10.719 --> 00:13.054
Who are you?

00:13.054 --> 00:14.347
Hello, there!

00:14.347 --> 00:16.641
Aren't you cute?

00:18.184 --> 00:20.937
Relinquish yourself to me!

00:20.937 --> 00:23.106
Or what?

00:23.106 --> 00:24.691
Melinda! We need you!

00:24.691 --> 00:27.026
I won't do it.
This is not my fight.

00:27.026 --> 00:29.112
No!

00:31.614 --> 00:34.868
I hate you.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.828
There's something else here!

01:08.860 --> 01:10.361
Who is that?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.325
A lady fox?

01:18.286 --> 01:19.662
She has powers.

01:19.662 --> 01:22.081
She might be the evil
we've been fighting agains--

01:22.081 --> 01:23.374
Aah!

01:31.591 --> 01:33.468
Well, I best be
getting back to work.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.761
Thanks for the tea, Mary.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.554
No crumpets today, James?

01:36.554 --> 01:38.973
No, Mary. No time.

01:42.435 --> 01:45.814
Well. Looks like I'll have time
for some crumpets after all.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.273
Lovely.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.154
Oh, no!

04:13.336 --> 04:14.963
Melinda?

04:14.963 --> 04:16.547
She has her.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.203
I am so sorry.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.706
Stay back!
Leave us alone!

04:49.706 --> 04:52.041
Melinda!
What are you doing?

04:52.041 --> 04:53.543
She's getting away!

04:57.964 --> 05:00.133
Please.
Just-- Just leave!

05:13.312 --> 05:14.897
Seng,
do you see her?

05:41.591 --> 05:42.925
There!

06:32.058 --> 06:34.894
We're moving!

07:05.258 --> 07:08.344
Seng, can you get us
out of here?

07:08.344 --> 07:10.638
Wha...?

07:14.892 --> 07:16.519
I-- I--

07:16.519 --> 07:20.148
I've lost
my connection.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.775
I can only see...

07:22.775 --> 07:25.444
what's in front of me.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.904
What does that mean?

07:26.904 --> 07:29.991
I see everything...

07:29.991 --> 07:31.951
but nothing!

07:34.662 --> 07:36.289
You have to
break this magic!

07:36.289 --> 07:37.748
I already tried.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.417
You didn't try
hard enough.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.294
You have more power
than all of us.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.045
Maybe I don't want
to use it.

07:43.045 --> 07:46.924
Then I guess we'll be
stuck here forever!

07:57.935 --> 07:59.395
Nope. I can't do it.

07:59.395 --> 08:01.189
We'll have to find
another way out.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.734
Ugh!
We'll search below.

08:04.734 --> 08:08.321
You and Seng search up here.
Find a way out.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.464
Upside down!

09:08.464 --> 09:11.050
That has always had
a better connection!

09:13.511 --> 09:14.762
Aah-aah!

09:14.762 --> 09:15.972
Unh!

09:30.152 --> 09:31.696
What?

09:39.912 --> 09:42.832
Aah!
What's happening?

09:42.832 --> 09:45.126
AAAAAAH!

09:50.089 --> 09:52.174
I don't understand
why you're holding back.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.759
Just leave it alone.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.636
I can't!
Because we're trapped here

09:55.636 --> 09:57.179
and you have the power
to get us out!

09:57.179 --> 09:59.223
- Stop!
- Stop what?

09:59.223 --> 10:02.268
Stop asking you
to just be yourself?!

10:33.466 --> 10:37.219
Light the path for us to see...
and even help her be with me.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.263
Hm!

10:39.263 --> 10:42.266
Does this seem
in any way familiar?

10:42.266 --> 10:43.392
No.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.561
The darkness?
The cold?

10:45.561 --> 10:46.562
No.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.522
And then we saw
a light.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.694
And then
we heard singing.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.750
We were captivated
by its sound.

11:10.586 --> 11:14.256
As if our very souls
bonded together by the melody.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.764
Emma!

11:21.764 --> 11:24.975
Waahhh!

11:24.975 --> 11:27.937
Winston?
Emma? Who's he?!

11:29.355 --> 11:32.900
My fiancé.
I mean, Emma's fiancé.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.151
Who's Emma?!

11:34.151 --> 11:38.280
Me! I mean, I'm Emma.
I <i>was</i> Emma.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.408
No. You're Melinda.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.326
Yes, but she's me now.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.828
I mean, this is her body.

11:43.828 --> 11:47.540
Emma, who--
<i>what</i> is this person?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.875
- What?!
- How did you get on this ship?

11:49.875 --> 11:52.044
I've been following you
since the hospital.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.587
You shouldn't
have done that.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.339
I have to.
You're my beloved.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.465
Beloved?!

11:56.465 --> 11:58.759
I will follow you
to the end.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.178
N-No, you will not!
She is Melinda!

12:01.178 --> 12:04.473
She is Emma Fairfax--
my fiancé, my life!

12:04.473 --> 12:05.975
Not anymore!

12:34.753 --> 12:38.007
It-- It's all
tied together.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.509
The cosmic realm
is part of my energy,

12:40.509 --> 12:42.678
and I am a part of <i>it.</i>

12:45.264 --> 12:49.226
When our links are severed,
I am nothing.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.940
Aaagghhh!

12:54.940 --> 12:56.400
What?! Aaah!

14:02.591 --> 14:03.801
Ooh...

14:09.765 --> 14:12.101
Oops.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.105
Ooh...

14:16.105 --> 14:18.023
A-ha!

14:18.023 --> 14:19.441
Ohh...

14:51.056 --> 14:54.226
Of course!
It's that Emma person!

14:54.226 --> 14:56.186
<i>She's</i> what's wrong with you!

14:56.186 --> 14:57.813
There is <i>nothing</i> wrong
with Emma!

14:57.813 --> 14:59.315
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.774
I'm dealing with it.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.818
It doesn't <i>seem</i> like
you're dealing with it!

15:02.818 --> 15:04.486
She's putting us all
in danger!

15:04.486 --> 15:06.864
Emma would never
hurt anyone!

15:10.284 --> 15:11.660
Do you feel that?

15:11.660 --> 15:13.746
Something's not right.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.165
What?!
What are you mixed up in?

15:16.165 --> 15:17.416
What <i>is</i> he?

15:17.416 --> 15:19.168
An elf.
An elf?!

15:19.168 --> 15:21.337
Elves aren't real.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.756
Hey!
I'm not <i>just</i> an elf!

15:23.756 --> 15:26.258
I'm firstborn
of the unbroken line.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.968
Prince of
the northern elves!

15:27.968 --> 15:29.678
Oh, really!

15:29.678 --> 15:31.680
Perhaps Your Highness
and his little elf friends

15:31.680 --> 15:33.807
would like to pop around
for some tea later, hmm?

15:33.807 --> 15:35.225
You dare mock me?!

15:35.225 --> 15:37.061
Will you two stop?!

15:55.746 --> 15:57.456
G-Ghosts?

15:59.416 --> 16:00.876
Emma!

16:02.586 --> 16:04.588
What are you doing?

16:11.595 --> 16:12.888
Emma...

17:47.316 --> 17:51.069
You have to unleash your full
power! You can't hold back!

17:51.069 --> 17:52.863
I can't do it!

17:56.450 --> 17:57.951
Emma!
Melinda!

18:12.174 --> 18:16.136
What are we going to do?
How are we going to help her?

18:16.136 --> 18:17.763
She needs to help herself.

18:17.763 --> 18:22.267
What?! No! Stop!
You have to help her!

18:28.565 --> 18:30.275
Seng!

18:30.275 --> 18:33.237
Edred. Help me.
I'm slippin' away.

18:33.237 --> 18:36.782
Don't worry.
Melinda's going to free us.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.033
Seng!

19:08.856 --> 19:10.482
Melinda!

19:18.156 --> 19:19.283
What did you do?

19:19.283 --> 19:21.952
What did I do?
I brought help.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.269
Whoo-hooooo!

19:54.860 --> 19:58.697
Melinda.
What did you do?

19:58.697 --> 20:00.282
What?
We're free.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.341
Phew!
Well, I'm glad that's over.

20:17.341 --> 20:20.552
Over?!
What about <i>that</i> thing?!

20:20.552 --> 20:22.638
What? It's nothing.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.978
You've unleashed
a terror!

20:29.978 --> 20:31.772
Oh, no...

20:38.612 --> 20:40.155
Emma.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.995
Go home.
She's not yours anymore.
