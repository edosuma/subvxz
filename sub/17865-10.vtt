Previously on
Another Period...

00:02.114 --> 00:03.880
Well, I met a boy I like.

00:03.882 --> 00:05.782
Laverne Fussleforth the fifth.

00:05.784 --> 00:08.451
What do you say about getting
married in, oh, I don't know,

00:08.453 --> 00:09.953
the next 45 minutes or so?

00:09.955 --> 00:11.755
We'll have to wait
for Bertram.

00:11.757 --> 00:14.958
I can't have a wedding without
my grandson here.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.594
How wonderful to finally
meet you, Grandma!

00:17.596 --> 00:19.362
I might be in love
with Hortense.

00:19.364 --> 00:21.765
What could you possibly see
in Hortense?

00:21.767 --> 00:24.734
Well, I suppose I don't see
much of anything

00:24.736 --> 00:26.670
on account of my glaucoma.

00:28.307 --> 00:32.308
Earthworms don't change
into butterflies, Chair.

00:32.311 --> 00:34.144
Someone took photos of us.

00:34.146 --> 00:36.579
Sexual photographs, Beatrice.

00:36.581 --> 00:38.214
You're no longer welcome here.

00:38.216 --> 00:39.416
Oh, Frederick!

00:39.418 --> 00:40.450
Get ye to a nunnery!

00:40.452 --> 00:41.451
Mother?

00:41.453 --> 00:43.253
Beatrice, I live here.

00:43.255 --> 00:45.221
May I have the ring, please?

00:45.223 --> 00:46.189
Put it on my finger.

00:52.431 --> 00:54.831
♪ I want the money,
I want the fame ♪

00:54.833 --> 00:57.267

01:08.513 --> 01:10.246
Everyone just relax.

01:10.248 --> 01:11.982
Laverne's just taking a nap.

01:11.984 --> 01:13.583
Give him some air!

01:13.585 --> 01:18.121
I am a registered Red Cross lady
of the Perpetual Watch.

01:21.793 --> 01:23.827
Oh, oh, I think he's just
playing charades.

01:23.829 --> 01:25.996
Sack of onions!

01:25.998 --> 01:27.297
Dead industrialist!

01:27.299 --> 01:28.698
Does anyone else
have any guesses?

01:28.700 --> 01:30.867
Oh, my God.

01:30.869 --> 01:33.336
Laverne has passed.

01:34.339 --> 01:35.705
No!

01:35.707 --> 01:36.873
You think you're "no"?

01:36.875 --> 01:38.208
I'm no!

01:38.210 --> 01:39.609
No!

01:39.611 --> 01:42.645
Laverne is in
a better place now--

01:42.647 --> 01:45.148
not engaged to Lillian.

01:45.150 --> 01:47.050
Oh, but this still counts
though, right?

01:47.052 --> 01:48.551
Listen up, everyone.

01:48.553 --> 01:50.520
There's something
I must confess.

01:50.522 --> 01:52.989
Laverne was...

01:52.991 --> 01:54.791
very old!

01:55.794 --> 01:56.860
Yes, it is true.

01:56.862 --> 01:58.294
I've known for some time.

01:58.296 --> 01:59.829
But let me say this--

01:59.831 --> 02:04.134
Grandpa loved life,
but more than that,

02:04.136 --> 02:06.770
he loved love,

02:06.772 --> 02:09.406
and I love you...

02:10.842 --> 02:12.208
Hortense.

02:14.379 --> 02:16.012
Where's Grandpa's ring?

02:16.014 --> 02:17.714
- Here it is.
- No, that's my ring!

02:17.716 --> 02:20.650
Well, seeing as you never
actually married Laverne,

02:20.652 --> 02:22.986
I am the legal heir to his
possessions and fortunes,

02:22.988 --> 02:25.422
so technically it's my ring.

02:25.424 --> 02:29.059
But actually,
it's Hortense's ring

02:29.061 --> 02:30.093
if she'll have it.

02:30.095 --> 02:31.895
Wait, is this even legal?

02:31.897 --> 02:33.663
I don't know.
I'm ship captain.

02:33.665 --> 02:34.931
Yes!

02:34.933 --> 02:36.966
I will marry you!

02:36.968 --> 02:38.301
Wait!

02:39.371 --> 02:41.271
You've never even seen her.

02:41.273 --> 02:43.073
By Job, you're right.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.774
I want to see
my beautiful bride.

02:44.776 --> 02:46.676
But should we check
with the doctor

02:46.678 --> 02:48.178
before you take those off?

02:48.180 --> 02:50.880
And how necessary is it really
to see the bride

02:50.882 --> 02:51.915
before one's marriage?

02:51.917 --> 02:53.349
Oh, foo-fah!

02:53.351 --> 02:55.418
I want to see your face,
damn it.

02:59.024 --> 03:01.624
So bright.

03:01.626 --> 03:03.860
So clear.

03:03.862 --> 03:05.728
I can see.

03:09.801 --> 03:13.069
Oh, my heavens.

03:14.272 --> 03:16.039
You're Hortense?

03:18.477 --> 03:19.909
You're...

03:19.911 --> 03:22.579
much more...

03:22.581 --> 03:25.482
beautiful than I ever
could've imagined.

I'm so happy!

03:42.100 --> 03:45.068
I'm so happy!

04:09.094 --> 04:10.093
God.

04:11.830 --> 04:14.497
Oh, God.
Fuck, yes.

04:14.499 --> 04:17.100
Beatrice, you do not need
to flagellate yourself

04:17.101 --> 04:18.668
to get into heaven.

04:18.670 --> 04:21.070
This is the fifth time
I'm telling you this.

04:21.072 --> 04:22.972
Oh, I know.

04:22.974 --> 04:24.807
I was doing it just in case.

04:24.809 --> 04:26.176
This may sound dramatic,

04:26.178 --> 04:28.478
but I really don't want
to go to hell.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.346
My dear...

04:30.348 --> 04:32.649
Sit down.

04:32.651 --> 04:35.685
You are not going to go to hell.

04:35.687 --> 04:38.021
Only people who don't believe
exactly as we do

04:38.023 --> 04:39.022
are going there.

04:39.024 --> 04:40.123
Right.

04:40.125 --> 04:41.591
Except for people I like.

04:41.593 --> 04:43.860
No, people you like
will be going to hell.

04:43.862 --> 04:45.028
A lot of them.

04:45.030 --> 04:46.362
- What?
- Oh, yes.

04:46.364 --> 04:48.198
One day you'll see someone
you love,

04:48.200 --> 04:50.500
and that's really wonderful,
but the next day,

04:50.502 --> 04:53.503
just know that they'll be
drinking and smoking

04:53.505 --> 04:57.040
and eating taffy
at the gates of hell.

04:57.042 --> 04:58.575
Drinking and smoking
and eating taffy

04:58.577 --> 04:59.642
at the gates of hell?

04:59.644 --> 05:01.544
God works in mysterious ways,

05:01.546 --> 05:04.180
but the devil works
in plain sight.

05:04.182 --> 05:06.049
Well, what about Lillian?

05:06.051 --> 05:08.418
- She's not going to hell, right?
- Tell me about this Lillian.

05:08.420 --> 05:11.487
Well, she sins all the time
and she doesn't believe

05:11.489 --> 05:15.825
in anything, but deep down,
she's really pretty.

05:15.827 --> 05:17.160
She's gonna go to hell.

05:17.162 --> 05:18.861
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

05:18.863 --> 05:20.129
Maybe I should flagellate
on her behalf.

05:20.131 --> 05:23.199
No.

05:24.936 --> 05:27.036
Yeah, no, I don't think
that'll help.

05:27.038 --> 05:29.272
You cannot save another person.

05:29.274 --> 05:33.243
If that were the case, then the
Lord would save all of mankind

05:33.245 --> 05:35.245
and no one would go to hell.

05:35.247 --> 05:37.013
Why doesn't he?

05:37.015 --> 05:39.682
Well, because.

05:39.684 --> 05:42.185
Oh, yeah.

05:42.187 --> 05:45.221
The best thing you can do
for those you love

05:45.223 --> 05:47.857
is forcefully push your beliefs
upon them.

05:47.859 --> 05:49.292
Thank you.

05:49.294 --> 05:50.593
Oh.

06:16.755 --> 06:19.255
Sweet Dodo,

06:19.257 --> 06:21.557
may I have this one...

06:21.559 --> 06:23.059
last dance?

06:35.473 --> 06:36.472
Oh.

06:43.682 --> 06:45.548
Tits on a frog!

06:45.550 --> 06:47.250
Oh, we've done it!

06:47.252 --> 06:48.584
It's official--

06:48.586 --> 06:51.187
the Bellacourt fortune
has been saved.

06:51.189 --> 06:54.190
Yes, and now it's time
to make us official.

06:54.192 --> 06:56.826
Oh, you're right.

06:58.530 --> 07:00.296
To love.

07:00.298 --> 07:01.597
To money.

07:04.402 --> 07:05.968
I'm a simple girl.

07:05.970 --> 07:08.304
All I want is a little RBP--

07:08.306 --> 07:10.473
rubies, beluga, and property.

07:12.043 --> 07:16.079
And here we go, you retched,
horrible creature.

07:16.081 --> 07:19.182
Soup for you,
you hideous old child.

07:23.621 --> 07:26.155
Eat up, old hobo.

07:27.559 --> 07:29.258
Gee, thanks, missus.

07:29.260 --> 07:33.296
'Tis the best bowl of soup
I ever did eat, I did.

07:33.298 --> 07:35.164
Oh, I almost forgot.

07:37.001 --> 07:39.535
You've been served.

07:40.905 --> 07:42.205
They're divorce papers.

07:42.207 --> 07:44.841
You are not an easy woman
to track down.

You're fat.

08:01.103 --> 08:05.038
Well, sir, it's Blanche,
and no, I am with child.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.339
Oh.

08:06.341 --> 08:07.740
Well, that would be adorable

08:07.742 --> 08:09.709
if not for your chilling lack
of a partner

08:09.711 --> 08:11.544
and basement-level
social standing.

08:11.546 --> 08:13.346
It's sad.

08:13.348 --> 08:16.683
My husband and I are going
to raise this child together.

08:16.685 --> 08:19.252
Victor, would you ever want
to have a child?

08:19.254 --> 08:20.920
Sometimes I hunger for a womb
of my own.

08:20.922 --> 08:22.422
Yes.

08:22.424 --> 08:24.557
Yes, I think with my thin,
aristocratic blood

08:24.559 --> 08:26.793
and my familial propensity
towards large-scale violence,

08:26.795 --> 08:29.262
this child would have
sure footing in this life.

08:29.264 --> 08:30.563
I'd be willing
to rear my own spawn

08:30.565 --> 08:32.565
if it had almond-shaped eyes

08:32.567 --> 08:34.200
and dressed primarily
in sailor suits.

08:34.202 --> 08:36.034
Mm.

08:36.037 --> 08:39.304
Forgive me, but don't you both
have multiple children already?

08:39.307 --> 08:41.207
Oh, my God.

08:41.208 --> 08:44.244
Are you brain damaged
or just organically stupid?

08:44.246 --> 08:46.679
Not from our wives.
Love child.

08:46.681 --> 08:48.414
Yeah.

08:48.416 --> 08:51.484
A child who would have mud-brown
hair, very straight spine.

08:51.486 --> 08:54.320
His name would be Tiberius
and he would only communicate

08:54.322 --> 08:55.588
through dance.

08:55.590 --> 08:57.590
Tiberius, handsome name.

08:57.592 --> 08:59.559
Like the proud Roman emperor
who oversaw

08:59.561 --> 09:01.895
the administrative apparatus
that killed Christ.

09:01.897 --> 09:03.062
Oh!

09:03.064 --> 09:04.464
I have a wonderful idea.

09:04.466 --> 09:07.167
We will take her child
and raise it as our own.

09:07.169 --> 09:09.602
Mm.
Well, what if it's a girl?

09:09.604 --> 09:11.604
Well, we do live
next to the Atlantic Ocean.

09:11.606 --> 09:14.174
We can teach her to sail
with the old heave-ho.

09:15.410 --> 09:17.177
We would drown her.

09:27.923 --> 09:30.156

09:30.158 --> 09:32.859
What are you doing here?

09:32.861 --> 09:35.962
- I'm on a very special mission.
- So am I.

09:35.964 --> 09:38.131
I'm going to get Lillian
to repent for all her sins

09:38.133 --> 09:40.633
so I don't have to go to
the heaven party alone.

09:40.635 --> 09:41.935
Please let me come.

09:41.937 --> 09:44.337
I hate going to parties
by myself.

09:44.339 --> 09:47.106
Aren't you worried about
Frederick finding out?

09:47.108 --> 09:48.808
He and his henchmen
seem quite intent

09:48.810 --> 09:50.610
on keeping you in the abbey.

09:50.612 --> 09:54.480
Mother, I can't be in danger
with God protecting me.

09:54.482 --> 09:57.684
It's not always
as black and white as that.

09:57.686 --> 10:00.486
Yes, it is.
Look at my outfit.

10:00.488 --> 10:04.791
That is not actually
a refutation of the argument.

10:04.793 --> 10:06.693
Well, I'm not worried about
my reputation.

10:06.695 --> 10:09.295
Now that I'm saved,
God will give me anything I want

10:09.297 --> 10:11.297
and nothing bad can ever happen.

10:33.088 --> 10:35.221
Yes, and Lady Beatrice.

10:35.223 --> 10:38.057
Peepers, do you have
your horsehair brush?

10:38.059 --> 10:39.058
Of course, madam.

10:39.060 --> 10:40.627
Shall I brush your hair?

10:40.629 --> 10:43.196
No, the carriage rolled
through a pile of cow shit.

10:43.198 --> 10:44.130
Scrub the wheels.

10:46.568 --> 10:47.867
Yes, madam.

And in that moment,

10:49.437 --> 10:52.205
I've never been more proud
to be head butler.

10:56.511 --> 10:59.579
It's been a long while
since I've been home.

10:59.581 --> 11:03.783
Well, it's not really
your home anymore, is it?

11:03.785 --> 11:07.387
Welcome to my home, Dodo.

11:07.389 --> 11:09.922
I have nothing to say to you.

11:09.924 --> 11:12.358
I need audience
with the Commodore.

11:13.395 --> 11:16.663
His schedule has been so busy,

11:16.665 --> 11:20.366
what with making love to me
and buying me everything I want,

11:20.368 --> 11:23.803
but I'll check and see
if he has an opening

11:23.805 --> 11:26.239
other than my vagina.

11:37.085 --> 11:40.119
Beautiful morning
for a garbage dump, isn't it?

11:40.121 --> 11:42.288
Yes, the breeze really
brings out the trash notes

11:42.290 --> 11:44.257
in the garbage.

11:45.727 --> 11:47.794
Yes.

11:47.796 --> 11:50.930
There's something almost
romantic about it.

11:54.936 --> 11:56.803
Cliffside garbage dump, huh?

11:58.506 --> 12:02.175
Oh, just the thought of it
makes me horny.

12:04.145 --> 12:05.945
Hamish...

12:05.947 --> 12:08.281
we were having a private
conversation.

12:08.283 --> 12:09.982
Garfield, you know when you're
taking a piss, you're like,

12:09.984 --> 12:12.819
"Wait a second, when's the last
time I drank a bottle

12:12.821 --> 12:15.121
of hot sand and broken glass?"

12:15.123 --> 12:17.690
Ho! 'Cause that's what's coming
out of it.

12:17.692 --> 12:18.925
I don't-- I don't know that.

12:20.228 --> 12:21.561
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:21.563 --> 12:24.030
Hold on there.

12:24.032 --> 12:26.099
Don't throw that away, huh?

12:26.101 --> 12:27.834
Cheese never goes bad,

12:27.836 --> 12:29.635
but I bet you do, right?

12:35.510 --> 12:37.176
Please.

12:37.178 --> 12:38.478
That really hurts.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.980
Makes me feel very unsafe.

12:44.686 --> 12:46.119
I'm sorry.
I--

12:46.121 --> 12:47.887
you don't know this--
why would you?

12:47.889 --> 12:51.457
But that-- that actually
was a major setback for me,

12:51.459 --> 12:53.059
saying that.

12:53.061 --> 12:54.127
It's a thing I do.

12:54.129 --> 12:56.229
Sexualizing women, it's--

12:56.231 --> 12:59.699
it's really just insecurity,
or rather self-hatred

12:59.701 --> 13:00.900
masking as aggression.

13:00.902 --> 13:02.702
I-- I read that in a book.

13:02.704 --> 13:04.303
I just learned to read,

13:04.305 --> 13:05.838
by the way.

13:07.208 --> 13:08.841
Sorry.

13:08.843 --> 13:09.776
I'll go.

13:19.187 --> 13:22.755
Oh, Laverne, I wish
I knew you longer.

13:22.757 --> 13:24.590
Maybe you had
more worldly possessions

13:24.592 --> 13:26.426
than this lap blanket.

13:26.428 --> 13:29.061
I guess I'll never know.

13:32.367 --> 13:34.367
What else can I burn?

13:39.874 --> 13:42.275
Oh, Lillian, there you are.

13:47.715 --> 13:50.316
Beatrice, would you
like some...

13:50.318 --> 13:52.118
...taffy?

13:56.858 --> 13:58.591
That's the devil's chew!

14:00.428 --> 14:02.762
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're going to hell.

14:02.764 --> 14:04.397
Because of taffy?

14:04.399 --> 14:08.201
No, but the good news
is I'm here to save you.

14:08.203 --> 14:11.504
Laverne is dead.
Hortense is married.

14:11.506 --> 14:13.005
I'm drunk.

14:13.007 --> 14:14.807
No, Lillian, listen to me.

14:14.809 --> 14:16.542
All you have to do is say
you're sorry for everything

14:16.544 --> 14:17.877
you've ever done
and you can attend

14:17.879 --> 14:19.011
the heaven party with me.

14:19.013 --> 14:20.880
The only thing I'm sorry about

14:20.882 --> 14:23.649
is that this cocaine wine
bottle's empty.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.721
Now I'm gonna go do some drugs

14:28.723 --> 14:31.390
and drink all the liquor
in the house.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.692
And then you'll say
you're sorry?

14:32.694 --> 14:34.293
Uh...

14:34.295 --> 14:35.895
no.

14:35.897 --> 14:39.799
But I'm trying to stop you
from going to hell!

14:39.801 --> 14:42.702
This is really bad.

14:50.698 --> 14:53.132
Dodo!

14:53.134 --> 14:54.533
I know what you're going to say.

14:54.535 --> 14:57.970
Oh, that I find divorce
embarrassing?

14:57.972 --> 15:01.507
A social failure befitting the
likes of a Scottish viscount?

15:01.509 --> 15:02.808
No.

15:02.810 --> 15:04.543
That I would be
the first woman

15:04.545 --> 15:08.714
in my family's 3,000-year
lineage to end a marriage

15:08.716 --> 15:11.050
for a reason other than
a bear attack?

15:11.052 --> 15:12.484
No, that you want me back.

15:12.486 --> 15:14.553
Oh, I assure you, I do not.

15:14.555 --> 15:16.989
This charade has gone on
long enough.

15:16.991 --> 15:19.325
I'm prepared to sign the papers.

15:19.327 --> 15:22.528
Like a fingerless man attempting
to operate a doorknob,

15:22.530 --> 15:23.929
I know when I've been defeated,

15:23.931 --> 15:26.999
but I'm going to want
a few things--

15:27.001 --> 15:30.903
the October home in Prague,
the eldest emu,

15:30.905 --> 15:33.672
the little man that we bring out
every Christmas

15:33.674 --> 15:35.241
to scare the carolers.

15:35.243 --> 15:37.042
- Terence.
- No!

15:37.044 --> 15:38.377
No Terence!

15:38.379 --> 15:41.046
No homes,
no large flightless birds.

15:41.048 --> 15:42.781
You get nothing!

15:42.783 --> 15:45.284
Commie, you're not really
going to let her to do this?

15:45.286 --> 15:48.220
You gave all my money away
to charity.

15:48.222 --> 15:50.856
Dodo, this seems like justice.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.060
Well...

15:55.062 --> 15:59.398
I suppose I'll just take
the abbey then.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.700
Wait.
We own an abbey?

16:01.702 --> 16:05.104
Yes, the Newport Abbey and
Balsamic Vinegar Sanctuary.

16:05.106 --> 16:10.809
You see, I-- I need a place
to go to live out my life

16:10.811 --> 16:13.045
in my solitary humiliation.

16:13.047 --> 16:15.247
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem, Dorothea.

16:15.249 --> 16:16.949
No.

16:16.951 --> 16:19.585
When I say I want it all,

16:19.587 --> 16:20.819
I want it all...

16:22.323 --> 16:25.424
From bean to bar,

16:25.426 --> 16:27.126
nook to nunnery.

16:27.128 --> 16:29.628
You get nothing.

16:29.630 --> 16:32.598
Darling, who gives a crap?

16:32.600 --> 16:34.266
We've the Fussleforth fortune.

16:34.268 --> 16:36.101
I give a crap!

16:36.103 --> 16:37.936
I want your money,

16:37.938 --> 16:39.638
your man,

16:39.640 --> 16:41.240
and your dignity.

16:41.242 --> 16:43.676
Oh, my dignity?

16:43.678 --> 16:46.945
Suck a plum, that's good.

16:46.947 --> 16:49.481
I'm giving you
almost everything,

16:49.483 --> 16:52.885
and you know deep inside
you're worth nothing.

16:52.887 --> 16:56.288
You'll never be better than that
Montreal brothel

16:56.290 --> 16:59.491
in which you were spawned,
you miscreant floozy.

16:59.493 --> 17:01.293
I'd be careful.

17:01.295 --> 17:03.495
She won't have sex with you
if you talk like that.

17:03.497 --> 17:06.799
I might be a miscreant floozy,

17:06.800 --> 17:10.269
but I'm the miscreant floozy
who's gonna own that abbey.

17:10.271 --> 17:13.137
Well, I suppose there's
only one respectable way

17:13.140 --> 17:15.607
to settle this--

17:15.608 --> 17:17.443
with a duel.

17:17.444 --> 17:20.612
I will gladly duel you,

17:20.614 --> 17:22.647
old hag.

17:25.553 --> 17:27.051
A duel!

17:29.890 --> 17:32.791
What the hell
is going on here?

17:32.793 --> 17:36.528
Um, Lady Beatrice locked up
the liquor.

17:36.530 --> 17:40.733
Oh, that little bitch is gonna
find God sooner than she thinks.

17:40.735 --> 17:44.002
Oh, Garfield, I need alcohol!

17:44.004 --> 17:46.071
Where can I find alcohol?

17:46.073 --> 17:47.873
Where? Where?
Where?

17:47.875 --> 17:49.274
Where?
Where?

17:49.276 --> 17:51.009
Well, at the--

17:51.011 --> 17:52.711
there's always a bar.

17:52.713 --> 17:54.646
A bar?

17:54.648 --> 17:56.248
A bar of what?

17:56.250 --> 17:59.318
A bar is a place where people
go to drink alcohol.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.419
Oh.

18:00.421 --> 18:04.423
Take me to this bar
you speak of.

18:04.425 --> 18:07.593
I want to go where nobody
knows my name.

18:16.203 --> 18:17.803
Madam,

18:17.805 --> 18:19.338
Mademoiselle....

18:22.276 --> 18:23.509
Your dueling swords.

18:23.511 --> 18:27.079
Whoever draws blood first wins.

18:27.081 --> 18:29.181
In the event of a tie,
we will do a sudden death round

18:29.183 --> 18:34.186
wherein whoever suffers
a sudden death loses.

18:34.188 --> 18:35.421
Mademoiselle.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.557
En guard!

18:38.559 --> 18:39.758
Aging madame.

18:45.766 --> 18:48.734
And one, two,
buckle my shoe.

18:48.736 --> 18:51.303
Let us go and have a duel!

18:51.305 --> 18:52.704
Lillian?

18:54.308 --> 18:55.541
Mary, have you seen Lillian?

18:58.412 --> 18:59.912
Oh.

18:59.914 --> 19:01.780
Mary, don't be afraid.

19:01.782 --> 19:04.349
I'm a child of God now.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.784
You can tell me.

19:06.821 --> 19:09.021
You can tell me anything.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.956
As long as it's not a den of sin

19:10.958 --> 19:13.091
or a place where alcohol
is served,

19:13.093 --> 19:16.995
no harm will come to you
or your family.

19:16.997 --> 19:18.931
Where is she, Mary?

19:18.933 --> 19:20.732
Where is she?

19:22.387 --> 19:23.686
Ah, yes.

19:23.688 --> 19:25.655
Classic Double Conundrum.

19:25.657 --> 19:28.891
Pig in a Poke, Reverse Foghat,
Schoolmarm's Got a Secret,

19:28.893 --> 19:30.226
and Hooray for the Circus Boy.

19:33.164 --> 19:36.532
Where's my Caustic?, Backwards
Bishop, A Rose for a Mute,

19:36.534 --> 19:38.635
and a Portuguese Goodbye!

19:40.705 --> 19:43.206
Paling into
a Gypsy's Rendezvous.

19:43.208 --> 19:45.875
It's time for you
to fold, Chair.

19:45.877 --> 19:48.211
Never, you bitch!

19:48.213 --> 19:50.046
My glasses!

19:51.349 --> 19:53.216
Oh, A Poke For Polly.

20:02.427 --> 20:04.327
Well, there was a great bit
of swashing and buckling

20:04.329 --> 20:06.863
from both sides,
but I think it's very clear

20:06.865 --> 20:10.767
that Celine "Chair" Bouffant
is the victor.

20:11.903 --> 20:13.836
Look at you.

20:13.838 --> 20:17.407
I have your family, you fortune,
your manor.

20:19.110 --> 20:21.744
Everything.

20:21.746 --> 20:23.212
You're right.

20:23.214 --> 20:24.847
You've won.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.516
Just kill me.

20:30.588 --> 20:32.889
You're pathetic.

20:32.891 --> 20:35.124
Keep your little abbey.
