WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.264
Previously on
Man with a Plan...

00:03.307 --> 00:04.743
This is such a fun way
to celebrate

00:04.787 --> 00:07.616
you guys finishing
the mini-mall.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.835
Hey, did Lisa say what
our next project is?
Mm-mm.

00:09.879 --> 00:13.448
The next project
I will be working on is...

00:13.491 --> 00:14.971
myself!

00:15.015 --> 00:17.974
We just lost our jobs.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.629
What's the matter?I just got laid off.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.544
So, we're busting
our humps all day

00:22.587 --> 00:23.980
while you two
get to sit around?

00:24.024 --> 00:27.114
Yeah. It's like
we're the kids now.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.333
Bring us back
some food and money.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.164
Dad, I broke
another toilet seat.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.731
[groans]

00:35.774 --> 00:37.863
Teddy, buddy, you lift
it up, you put it down.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.822
That's it.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.129
Where are you
going off script?

00:42.172 --> 00:45.045
It's a teen boy in a bathroom.
He's gonna push the limits.

00:48.265 --> 00:51.921
Aw, thanks, buddy.
It's still warm.

00:51.964 --> 00:55.838
Oh, he broke another one?

00:55.881 --> 00:57.318
Neither of is working.

00:57.361 --> 01:00.321
We're gonna go bankrupt
on toilet seats.

01:00.364 --> 01:01.887
All right.
We should get to work.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.019
Yeah.
Wait.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.760
You guys got a job?Mm.

01:04.803 --> 01:06.022
That's fantastic.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.806
Oh, it's just a small
kitchen remodel

01:07.850 --> 01:09.678
for my parents.

01:11.506 --> 01:12.855
BOTH:
Adam, this is a terrible idea.

01:12.898 --> 01:15.075
Your parents are impossible.

01:15.118 --> 01:18.165
I really don't like it
when you do that.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.905
Okay. I'm sorry.
Look, honey.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.733
It's just a quick job
to tide us over

01:21.777 --> 01:24.084
until Lisa McCaffrey
gives us our next project.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.608
We got bills. We're going
through a toilet seat a week!

01:26.651 --> 01:28.958
Okay? I got to keep
money coming in.

01:29.001 --> 01:31.613
Honey, I love that
you're thinking about us,

01:31.656 --> 01:34.398
but working for your parents
is never a good idea.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.834
You remember
The Partridge Family?

01:35.878 --> 01:37.358
Things got so weird

01:37.401 --> 01:39.708
that one of the kids
started dating his sister.

01:39.751 --> 01:42.406
Oh, I've always had
a thing for that mom.

01:42.450 --> 01:45.583
Many a lonely night, she stopped
by Don Town in a tight sweater.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.457
Downtown Don Town.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.459
What did I say, okay?

01:51.502 --> 01:53.330
Never talk
about Don Town.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.419
Especially
Downtown Don Town.

01:55.463 --> 01:58.248
Look, I know it's not great,
but I'd appreciate it

01:58.292 --> 01:59.902
if you'd support
me on this.

01:59.945 --> 02:01.164
No, I know. You're right.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.557
We support each other.
That's our deal.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.993
Right. Exactly.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.690
Just like I supported you
when we went to Jamaica

02:05.734 --> 02:06.952
and you got
cornrows so tight

02:06.996 --> 02:08.867
that you couldn't
close your eyes.

02:08.911 --> 02:11.131
When you give me
margaritas in the morning,

02:11.174 --> 02:12.828
I'm gonna make
some bold choices.

02:16.745 --> 02:17.876
Man, after a few weeks
of unemployment,

02:17.920 --> 02:19.574
it felt great to
swing a hammer again.

02:19.617 --> 02:22.142
Yeah.And to shock you with
this exposed wire.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.621
That was fun.
Yeah.

02:23.665 --> 02:27.538
I saw Grandpa for a second,
but he said, "Go back."

02:27.582 --> 02:29.714
Oh, we're so excited
about the new kitchen.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.455
I'm gonna make
so many wonderful dinners

02:31.499 --> 02:33.805
you're gonna be sorry
you got married and moved out.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.678
Ma, it's been 17 years.
Let it go.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.899
What the hell is going on?

02:40.943 --> 02:43.206
W-We're putting in a new kitchen
like you asked.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.773
What are you talking about?

02:44.816 --> 02:47.210
[clears throat] Uh, uh,
I can clear it up for you, Joe.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.820
Yeah, I did this
behind your back.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.257
Wh...?

02:50.300 --> 02:51.432
Ma.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.085
Where am I supposed
to eat my donuts?

02:53.129 --> 02:55.784
[stammers] Dad,
we had no idea.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.612
Every time
I talked to Mom about this,

02:57.655 --> 02:59.788
she said, "We'reso excited
about the new kitchen."

02:59.831 --> 03:01.137
You said "we."

03:01.181 --> 03:04.053
Yeah. Me and
the kitchen. We.

03:04.096 --> 03:07.056
Look, I-I'm sorry, Joe,
but y-you left me no choice.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.058
Every time I brought up
getting a new kitchen,

03:09.101 --> 03:10.625
you pretended to be asleep.

03:10.668 --> 03:13.149
Avoiding something
by pretending to be asleep.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.151
I wonder where I learned
that trick, huh?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.545
Okay, okay, okay.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.286
Let's step lightly
in that minefield.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.113
Bedrooms have doors
for a reason.

03:21.157 --> 03:24.073
What am I supposed to do until
you build me a new kitchen?

03:24.116 --> 03:25.553
Give me a break.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.685
You do things without asking me
all the time.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.166
I threw away one
bird bath in 1986,

03:30.210 --> 03:33.038
and I'm hearing about it
for the rest of my life.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.997
Those birds were my friends.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.955
Well, I'm not giving
a free bath

03:36.999 --> 03:39.567
to someone who craps
on my windshield!

03:41.569 --> 03:43.745
How's working for
your parents going?

03:43.788 --> 03:47.705
So good.
So many fun surprises.

03:47.749 --> 03:50.230
Oh, don't forget
our stuff in the car.

03:55.844 --> 03:58.586
Stuff? What stuff?

03:58.629 --> 04:00.979
Their luggage.
They're staying with us.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.503
Surprise!

04:04.635 --> 04:07.029
â™ª

04:16.386 --> 04:17.518
Cereal?

04:17.561 --> 04:18.954
This isn't breakfast.

04:18.997 --> 04:21.130
It looks like something
you shake over a fish tank.

04:21.173 --> 04:24.438
You know where they have
a great breakfast?

04:24.481 --> 04:26.614
At the La Quinta Inn. Yeah.

04:26.657 --> 04:29.530
That's Spanish for
"not my house."

04:31.009 --> 04:33.185
Okay.

04:33.229 --> 04:36.145
Let's start
making some decisions.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.452
All right, this
is the fun part.

04:38.495 --> 04:40.802
The fast and fun part.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.456
Okay, you guys
pick a cabinet.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.719
We'll put it in, and then we'll
have you back in your house

04:44.762 --> 04:46.808
in a couple of days, all right?

04:46.851 --> 04:48.723
Then I can spend the rest of
the month apologizing to Andi.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.899
Oh, this is
an easy choice.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.074
Yeah, no-brainer.

04:52.117 --> 04:53.162
BOTH:
That one.

04:53.205 --> 04:56.383
Oh, that's too plain, Joe.

04:56.426 --> 04:57.993
If you wanted plain,
you should've married

04:58.036 --> 05:00.996
that IHOP waitress
you dated before me.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.389
Well, she may have been dull,

05:02.432 --> 05:05.087
but she never
tore up my kitchen.

05:05.130 --> 05:08.743
Oh, I'm sorry, but I just,
I don't like any of them.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.092
She doesn't like
any of them, Adam.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.615
Not any of them.
Okay.

05:11.659 --> 05:13.791
O-Okay. Okay, uh, I got
more samples at work.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.271
I'll bring everything
back here,

05:15.315 --> 05:16.925
and we'll keep this
train rolling.

05:16.968 --> 05:19.449
And while I'm gone,
don't forget you love me.

05:23.540 --> 05:26.935
I saw some pancake mix
in the pantry.

05:26.978 --> 05:29.677
As much as I'd love to make
you guys another breakfast,

05:29.720 --> 05:31.461
I got to look at job listings

05:31.505 --> 05:34.159
and see if they posted
anything new.

05:40.905 --> 05:43.125
Hey, guys.

05:43.168 --> 05:46.998
Oh, dear. You're not
qualified for any of these.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.178
Lowell, what are you
doing here?

05:53.222 --> 05:55.442
I come every day
hoping you'll show up.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.182
I miss the relentless,
juvenile teasing

05:57.226 --> 05:59.446
that told me
I was one of the guys.

05:59.489 --> 06:02.666
[chuckles]
Activia yogurt, huh?

06:02.710 --> 06:04.451
I'm surprised that didn't
come with a sports bra,

06:04.494 --> 06:07.018
Jamie Lee Curtis.

06:07.062 --> 06:09.020
That's the stuff.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.108
[chuckles]
Yeah. Hey, come on.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.762
We got to hurry up.

06:11.806 --> 06:14.330
Our parents are at my house with
my angry wife and I'm not there.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.812
Hold on. I'm not there.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.509
Pass the lady yogurt.

06:19.553 --> 06:22.860
Oh, hey,
Lisa McCaffrey called.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.993
She's stopping by later
with a "exciting new proposal

06:25.036 --> 06:26.429
for Burns Brothers."

06:26.473 --> 06:28.605
She must've picked
our next project,

06:28.649 --> 06:30.607
which means we're
going back to work.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.044
A real job where people
don't come live with me

06:33.088 --> 06:34.785
during construction.

06:34.829 --> 06:37.222
Ah, I hope Lisa picks
something cool for us to build,

06:37.266 --> 06:40.051
like a Victoria's Secret
go-kart track.

06:40.095 --> 06:41.705
That's not a real thing.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.707
It is in Don Town.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.497
Hey. What are you
doing out here?

06:50.540 --> 06:52.673
Uh-oh. Is that car wine?

06:52.716 --> 06:55.458
I'm hiding from your parents.

06:55.502 --> 06:58.679
They spent the whole time
you were gone

06:58.722 --> 07:01.029
suggesting new careers for me.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.466
And your mom said
I should work at Hooters.

07:03.510 --> 07:07.818
But in the back, shredding
lettuce with the older gals.

07:07.862 --> 07:10.865
What? No way.
You'd be out front.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.868
What she doesn't understand is
it's not how old you are,

07:13.911 --> 07:15.304
it's about the hooters.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.002
And your hooter age is 27.

07:18.046 --> 07:21.092
27, 28. 29 tops.

07:21.136 --> 07:24.008
Good call staying under 30.

07:24.052 --> 07:27.447
You know, y-your folks
were right about one thing.

07:27.490 --> 07:30.537
Hmm?I mean, why am I only
looking for hospital jobs?

07:30.580 --> 07:32.408
You know? I mean, I should,

07:32.452 --> 07:35.367
I should try something I'm good
at and-and passionate about.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.892
I just don't know
what that is.

07:37.935 --> 07:39.937
Do they pay people
to drink wine?

07:39.981 --> 07:41.417
Yeah, well, if they did,

07:41.461 --> 07:43.245
we'd be having this conversation
on a yacht.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.203
Hey.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.031
Took you an awful long time
to get back here.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.033
Yeah. Yeah, it was
a combination of traffic

07:49.077 --> 07:52.080
and, uh, not wanting
to come back. Yeah.

07:52.123 --> 07:54.474
But I have good news which might
seem like bad news at first.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.258
I got to bring these samples
in to my parents,

07:56.301 --> 07:57.955
but then I got to leave again.What?

07:57.999 --> 07:59.566
Well, yeah, I got a meeting
with Lisa McCaffrey

07:59.609 --> 08:00.697
about a new project.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.177
Oh, a new job.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.657
Well, I'll drink to that.
[chuckles]

08:03.700 --> 08:05.441
Things are turning around
for us, Andi.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.487
Pretty soon, we'll even
be able to spend time

08:07.530 --> 08:09.358
in our own house.Ah.

08:09.401 --> 08:12.187
We found the perfect job
for you, honey.

08:12.230 --> 08:15.103
There's a company that needs
a head of international sales.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.191
Ooh.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.498
And that guy's
gonna need a secretary.

08:22.893 --> 08:25.374
So, Lisa, what, uh, what did
you want to talk to us about?

08:25.417 --> 08:28.116
Well, gentlemen,
I have some very exciting news

08:28.159 --> 08:29.683
regarding your employment.

08:29.726 --> 08:32.337
Employment. [chuckles]
I love that word.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.949
I'm a fan of the word "gravy."

08:34.992 --> 08:37.995
I'm really looking forward
to saying our favorites.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.476
I like radicchio.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.696
It's just fun.
Radicchio.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.306
Radicchio.

08:44.349 --> 08:47.135
Guys, guys, that's not
what we're doing.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.572
Uh, sorry.
Go ahead, Lisa.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.619
Well, you are
my favorite contractors.

08:52.662 --> 08:54.142
Uh, this might
surprise you,

08:54.185 --> 08:56.971
but a lot of people find me
difficult to work with

08:57.014 --> 08:59.103
and generally unpleasant.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.628
No.
What?
I can see it.

09:01.671 --> 09:04.587
And I don't want to lose you
in between projects,

09:04.631 --> 09:06.981
so I want to buy you out.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.983
Sold!
Yes!

09:09.026 --> 09:11.289
We are gonna be
swimming in gravy.

09:11.333 --> 09:14.162
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
W-What does that mean?

09:14.205 --> 09:16.294
It means you and Don will be
my full-time project managers

09:16.338 --> 09:17.992
and I'll pay you
even when you're not working.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.254
These are my terms.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.996
Um...

09:22.039 --> 09:24.172
Wow, that's
a nice number.

09:24.215 --> 09:27.784
But... o-okay, but I-I need
some time to think about this.

09:27.828 --> 09:31.222
Oh, take all the time you need.
You have 30 seconds.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.531
What do you think?I think we sell.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.533
Then there'd be no
more Burns Brothers,

09:37.577 --> 09:39.100
but also no more
unemployment.

09:39.143 --> 09:40.841
You sold me. Sell.

09:40.884 --> 09:43.931
Yeah, but don't you like
having our own office?

09:43.974 --> 09:46.847
It's a crappy trailer. Sell.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.327
I do have three kids
to put through college.

09:49.371 --> 09:51.852
Maybe she'll buy them, too.
Sell.

09:52.853 --> 09:55.203
Okay, uh...

09:55.246 --> 09:56.639
yeah, we'll, uh,
we'll take the deal.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.032
Oh, hang on. What
about Lowell?

09:58.075 --> 10:00.034
What's a Lowell?

10:00.077 --> 10:01.470
I'm Lowell.

10:01.513 --> 10:04.560
Oh, I thought you were Chad.
Chad's in the deal.

10:04.604 --> 10:08.956
Wow. Chad's making
out pretty good here.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.697
Holy cow!

10:10.740 --> 10:13.438
Hi, I'm Chad.
Chad Radicchio.

10:19.357 --> 10:20.881
Kate, ask your grandfather
what he thinks

10:20.924 --> 10:22.665
of this paint color
for our kitchen.

10:22.709 --> 10:26.451
I believe it's called
Stubborn Old Gray.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.976
Okay.

10:29.019 --> 10:31.065
Grandpa, what do you think
about this one?

10:31.108 --> 10:33.676
Tell her it's fine, if she would
like to drink coffee

10:33.720 --> 10:35.373
in the ass of a rhino.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.334
He doesn't love it.

10:39.377 --> 10:43.338
Okay, guys, look, the answer
is right in front of you, okay?

10:43.381 --> 10:46.558
Uh, you go with a simple
Shaker cabinet for Joe,

10:46.602 --> 10:48.735
but you give it
some style for Bev

10:48.778 --> 10:50.606
by painting it, uh,
Midnight Blue,

10:50.650 --> 10:52.434
and then you tie it all together

10:52.477 --> 10:55.089
with a clean, white
countertop and this,

10:55.132 --> 10:57.178
a mosaic backsplash
that has the same gray

10:57.221 --> 10:59.049
as the pillows on your couch.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.268
Wow.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.487
That's pretty.

11:02.531 --> 11:06.013
Yeah, honey,
you've got talent!

11:06.056 --> 11:09.103
Well, we should've been looking
for much better jobs for her.

11:09.146 --> 11:12.933
Yeah, Mom, that was incredible.
How'd you do that?

11:12.976 --> 11:15.283
I-I don't know.
I could just see it.

11:15.326 --> 11:18.808
I guess watching every episode
of Fixer Upperfinally paid off.

11:19.983 --> 11:22.116
Ooh, I should write Chip
and Joanna Gaines a letter.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.508
Another letter.

11:23.552 --> 11:26.511
They-they asked me to stop
sending them letters.

11:28.339 --> 11:29.863
Hey.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.125
Hey.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.561
I had such a great day.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.781
Ah. Uh-huh?Okay, I-- me, your wife--

11:34.824 --> 11:36.783
designed your parents'
whole kitchen.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.220
Wha...?Yeah. Uh, my desire to get
rid of them was so strong

11:39.263 --> 11:41.309
that it unleashed
a superpower in me.

11:41.352 --> 11:45.182
[chuckles]Yeah, like-like, when a mom
lifts a car off a baby.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.794
That's fantastic.
Yeah.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.144
Well, I have some pretty
great news for you, too.

11:50.187 --> 11:51.711
[gasps] Oh, it's about
your meeting with Lisa?

11:51.754 --> 11:53.321
[stammers]
What happened?

11:53.364 --> 11:55.323
[chuckles]:
Well...

11:55.366 --> 11:57.107
Well, get ready,
it's pretty huge.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.198
I sold her my business.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.765
What?

12:02.809 --> 12:05.376
Yeah. I'm gonna
work for her full-time.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.989
No more going from job to job,
no more ups and downs.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.382
Everything's gonna
be nice and steady.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.602
Everybody loves steady.
Remember when we went steady?

12:13.645 --> 12:15.430
You loved that.

12:15.473 --> 12:19.260
Yeah, but, uh, what happens to
Burns Brothers Construction?

12:19.303 --> 12:21.131
Why you asking me
so many questions?

12:21.175 --> 12:22.872
I asked you one question.

12:22.916 --> 12:25.135
I mean, you just told me
that me company you've been

12:25.179 --> 12:28.051
building for 25 years is
just... is it gonna be gone?

12:28.095 --> 12:31.446
[scoffs] Uh, what happened
to supporting each other?

12:31.489 --> 12:33.448
Huh? You know,
everybody else was happy.

12:33.491 --> 12:36.059
You weren't there.
You didn't see the look on Don

12:36.103 --> 12:38.409
and Chad's faces when they knew
they had steady work coming.

12:38.453 --> 12:41.282
Who's Chad?
Chad Radicchio.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.153
Well, that's Lowell now.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.981
See, there's stuff
you don't know.
Okay.

12:45.025 --> 12:47.767
Wait, why are you
being so defensive?D-Defensive?

12:47.810 --> 12:49.812
Who's being defensive?
I'm not being defensive.

12:49.856 --> 12:53.120
Look, I did the right thing
here, is what I did. Yeah.

12:53.163 --> 12:56.253
Yeah, I got a family to support,
a brother to think about.

12:56.297 --> 12:59.517
The company can't survive on
just doing my parents' kitchen.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.128
Okay? There wasn't another way.

13:01.171 --> 13:04.044
So let-- j-just be happy
about this way.

13:04.087 --> 13:07.221
Okay, okay.
I'm happy if you're happy.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.352
Yeah.
[chuckles]

13:08.396 --> 13:10.180
Uh, are you happy?

13:10.224 --> 13:12.008
Yes, very happy!

13:12.052 --> 13:14.402
'Cause it's the best thing
that's happened to me all year.

13:14.445 --> 13:15.403
[grunts]

13:15.446 --> 13:17.579
Hey, w-where you going?

13:17.622 --> 13:19.276
Going outside, t-to chop wood.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.626
'Cause that's what I do
when I'm real happy!

13:25.630 --> 13:28.068
He's been out
there for an hour.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.635
Only an unhappy man
chops wood in May.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.247
Did you cheat on him?

13:33.290 --> 13:35.771
No.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.904
Look... he's selling
his company,

13:37.947 --> 13:39.949
and I-I think I made him
feel bad about it.

13:39.993 --> 13:42.082
But I just, I don't understand
why he would do this.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.606
Well, you can't. He's a man.

13:44.649 --> 13:47.087
[chuckles]:
Oh.

13:47.130 --> 13:51.918
So, uh, he's a man, and I'm just
a girl, so I can't understand?

13:51.961 --> 13:55.051
Well, before you get
on your lady high horse,

13:55.095 --> 13:56.444
I'm just saying

13:56.487 --> 13:58.272
that it's a man's
natural instinct

13:58.315 --> 14:01.318
to take care
of the people he loves.

14:01.362 --> 14:04.887
Yeah, but he's
obviously miserable.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.194
Well, that's what he signed up
for when he got married.

14:07.237 --> 14:10.023
Well, he said
this is the only way.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.590
Well, somebody should figure out
another way and point him to it,

14:12.634 --> 14:15.898
because he's in too deep
to figure it out for himself.

14:15.942 --> 14:19.249
Okay. You got any ideas?

14:19.293 --> 14:21.251
That wasmy idea.

14:21.295 --> 14:23.166
Maybe you could do
a little something.

14:25.429 --> 14:26.604
ADAM:
Okay.

14:26.648 --> 14:27.823
I think we're done.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.607
Yeah. Looks good.
Mm.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.871
Hey, by the way,
we got an offer on the trailer.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.263
Our office trailer?

14:33.307 --> 14:34.874
What, you already
put that up for sale?

14:34.917 --> 14:36.223
We're not gonna need it now.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.355
Unless you want
to do my idea,

14:38.399 --> 14:40.618
and turn it into
a tiny casino.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.882
This is all happening
really fast.

14:42.925 --> 14:46.407
I... Are you having any,
I don't know, second thoughts?

14:46.450 --> 14:48.409
No, I don't have those.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.801
Okay.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.760
I guess it's just
hard to believe

14:51.803 --> 14:54.719
this is our last job
as the Burns Brothers, you know?

14:54.763 --> 14:56.373
It's been a great run.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.723
Yeah. I couldn't have
done it without you.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.856
Except for the days
you went to the dog track

15:00.900 --> 15:02.640
and I did do it without you.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.904
Thanks for everything, brother.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.210
Come on.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.038
All right, all right,
I'll hug you this time,

15:09.082 --> 15:10.474
but let's not touch middles.

15:10.518 --> 15:12.041
Keep Adam Town
away from Don Town.

15:12.085 --> 15:14.696
[chuckles][door opens]

15:14.739 --> 15:16.132
Look at this!

15:16.176 --> 15:17.351
BEV:
My gosh!

15:17.394 --> 15:20.963
Oh, boys,
I'm thrilled!

15:21.007 --> 15:22.965
It's just like I pictured it

15:23.009 --> 15:25.881
way back when I first decided
to trick your father.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.405
Thanks, Ma.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.712
We do good work.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.366
Well, these cabinets are
broken; they won't slam.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.237
Well, they're soft-close.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.499
Soft-close?

15:35.543 --> 15:37.327
How do you express your mood?

15:37.371 --> 15:39.939
I don't know, learn
to play guitar.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.942
Oh, I love it.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.335
Eh? Great job, honey.Yeah.

15:45.379 --> 15:48.904
Hey, listen.
I'm sorry about last night.

15:48.948 --> 15:49.992
What? That's okay.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.602
Look, honey,
I know you well enough

15:51.646 --> 15:53.735
to know
that wasn't about me.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.955
These drawers are quiet, too?

15:55.998 --> 15:58.000
This is un-American.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.350
So? How you doing?

16:00.394 --> 16:02.570
Okay, I guess.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.964
We ended Burns Brothers
where we started it.

16:05.007 --> 16:08.228
In Mom's kitchen, with Dad
walking around muttering.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.274
Actually, um, speaking of that,

16:11.318 --> 16:13.798
uh, there's something
that I want to show you and Don.

16:13.842 --> 16:16.888
Oh, we're okay.
The fridge still slams.

16:16.932 --> 16:20.153
Huh? Yeah.
[mutters]

16:25.332 --> 16:28.639
An abandoned house?
Why-why would you bring me here?

16:28.683 --> 16:30.685
I've been in this situation
with Marcy.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.904
She's about to tell you this
is where you're gonna be living

16:32.948 --> 16:35.298
until she cools down.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.170
Look, honey, if I
thought you were happy

16:37.213 --> 16:39.346
about selling your business,
I-I'd stay out of it.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.391
But I know you're
only doing it

16:41.435 --> 16:43.741
because you're thinking about
everybody else before yourself.

16:43.785 --> 16:47.136
But it's my job
to think about you.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.965
That's way different than
anything Marcy ever said to me.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.709
I can't let you
be this unhappy.

16:54.752 --> 16:56.319
I'll be fine.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.582
Look, honey, I think it's sweet
that you're worried about me,

16:58.626 --> 17:00.497
but it doesn't
change our situation.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.325
[laughs softly]

17:02.369 --> 17:04.849
I'm so glad you said that,
because when I practiced this

17:04.893 --> 17:06.938
in the shower, that's
exactly what you said.

17:06.982 --> 17:09.202
And I have a solution.

17:09.245 --> 17:12.074
Okay, instead of
waiting for Lisa

17:12.118 --> 17:14.337
or for somebody else
to bring you projects,

17:14.381 --> 17:16.383
what if we make
our own projects?

17:16.426 --> 17:18.124
Like with Lincoln Logs?

17:18.167 --> 17:20.300
Will you let her talk?

17:20.343 --> 17:23.564
No. What if we buy this
place, for next to nothing,

17:23.607 --> 17:25.348
I design it,
you guys fix it up

17:25.392 --> 17:27.089
and then we flip it
for a profit.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.787
And then, you know,
we keep doing that.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.703
I-I know you said that
there wasn't another way,

17:32.747 --> 17:35.619
but... I think
this could be it.

17:35.663 --> 17:39.406
Then we wouldn't
have to sell our business.

17:39.449 --> 17:43.279
And we'd be fixer uppers,
like Chip and Joanna Gaines.

17:43.323 --> 17:46.195
And Chip's brother,
Don Gaines.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.718
And this time,

17:47.762 --> 17:49.938
the Burns Brothers
will be making their own work.

17:49.981 --> 17:51.461
We'd really be our own bosses.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.855
Oh, we could take
so much time off.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.597
Welcome to working with Don.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.990
Don't worry,
you won't see much of me.

18:00.296 --> 18:01.384
I mean, this place
has potential.

18:01.428 --> 18:02.603
This could work.Yeah.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.735
I-If we blow out this wall,

18:04.779 --> 18:06.563
you know, give it
an open floor plan.

18:06.607 --> 18:09.218
Yeah, or we could
blow out that wall,

18:09.262 --> 18:11.699
and then you'd get the light
from the backyard.

18:11.742 --> 18:14.093
That's better. I didn't
even think of that.

18:14.136 --> 18:17.096
I always have to
think of everything.

18:17.139 --> 18:21.100
So? Um, are you in?

18:21.143 --> 18:23.232
Hey, okay, look,
I know it's a big risk

18:23.276 --> 18:26.627
to walk away from steady work,
but I want to go for it.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.933
Let's turn down Lisa's offer.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.196
I'm in.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.545
Seriously?

18:31.588 --> 18:33.155
This is so exciting.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.157
Oh, and-and, Don,
if it's weird

18:35.201 --> 18:36.767
that Adam and I are
working together,

18:36.811 --> 18:39.422
I was thinking that we could
ask Marcy to dust off

18:39.466 --> 18:43.122
her old real estate license and
she can help sell the houses.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.601
I'm out.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.168
Wha...

18:46.212 --> 18:49.432
Okay, well, sh-she didn't
mean it. [stammers]

18:49.476 --> 18:52.131
I'll see you at work, Monday.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.220
Be careful with him.
He avoids work.

18:54.263 --> 18:56.918
You leave the trailer door open,
he runs out like a cat.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.921
Got it.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.923
Hey.
Huh?

19:01.966 --> 19:04.186
Thanks for this.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.362
For... for all of this.

19:06.406 --> 19:09.626
Aw. [chuckles]

19:09.670 --> 19:11.802
Well, you know, it's
great for me, too, right?

19:11.846 --> 19:13.456
I mean, I have a new career.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.024
Yeah. So we're
working together, huh?

19:16.067 --> 19:18.200
Like, when I leave
in the morning and get to work,

19:18.244 --> 19:19.332
you'll be there.

19:19.375 --> 19:22.465
No, silly.
We'll drive together.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.859
We will.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.209
Yeah, yeah. [gasps]
And we'll have lunch together.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.906
Ah.And we'll drive home together.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.169
Oh, yeah.And then-- oh.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.561
You know, when we get home,

19:31.605 --> 19:33.476
we can talk about
all the things we did

19:33.520 --> 19:36.218
while we were driving
and working and eating.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.264
[both laugh]

19:40.353 --> 19:43.094
Oh, boy, here we go.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.101
Okay, your mom and
I talked it over,

19:50.145 --> 19:51.755
and we have decided
to partner up.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.583
Now, I know it's
a big adjustment,

19:53.627 --> 19:56.369
but the cool thing is we're
gonna be doing it together.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.371
What if you guys disagree
about something at work?

19:58.414 --> 20:00.199
Does Mom win, like
she does at home?

20:00.242 --> 20:01.809
[sighs]
[chuckles]

20:01.852 --> 20:03.637
It's not about
winning, Teddy.

20:03.680 --> 20:07.249
As her boss, I will
make a fair decision.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.859
You're my boss?

20:08.903 --> 20:10.644
No, no. No.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.036
No, no, we're partners.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.386
Oh, yeah.
[chuckles]

20:13.429 --> 20:15.257
Yep, she's gonna win.

20:16.954 --> 20:19.566
This is a terrible idea.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.395
I'm with Chad.
