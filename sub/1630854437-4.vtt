00:09.931 --> 00:12.413
Fished a radio collar out
of the Yellowstone River.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.310
Seen any wolves
around lately?

00:14.310 --> 00:16.275
Sounds like poachers.

00:16.275 --> 00:18.206
- Sure does.
- Care to ride with us?

00:18.206 --> 00:20.310
Monica wants
to have a funeral.

00:20.310 --> 00:23.241
She wants him here
where she can visit.

00:23.241 --> 00:25.379
Whatever she wants, you--
you give it, son.

00:25.379 --> 00:27.448
I can't serve both.

00:27.448 --> 00:29.793
I choose her
and I choose my son.

00:29.793 --> 00:32.793
You promised and you took
millions in lease payments!

00:32.793 --> 00:33.827
You have no case.

00:33.827 --> 00:35.517
And you know it.

00:35.517 --> 00:37.689
You're better
than I expected.

00:37.689 --> 00:42.448
I am here just to find
a soft landing.

00:42.448 --> 00:45.103
How busy are you
tomorrow night?

00:45.103 --> 00:46.586
New York would like
to drop the suit.

00:46.586 --> 00:50.586
Find a way to ruin
this family, Ellis.

00:50.586 --> 00:52.241
Hey, let's go
to a bar in Bozeman.

00:52.241 --> 00:54.862
Yeah, that's a bad
idea every time.

00:54.862 --> 00:56.655
Aren't you a tall
drink of water?

00:56.655 --> 00:58.344
I'm married. Go on.

00:58.344 --> 00:59.793
I'm taking
your husband home.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.241
What day is it?

01:21.827 --> 01:23.206
Thursday, I think.

01:35.655 --> 01:37.137
What happened to you?

01:38.689 --> 01:40.034
Fucking men.

01:41.448 --> 01:44.068
Worked you over
pretty good, huh?

01:44.068 --> 01:46.620
I'm talking about the
cop that arrested me.

01:50.586 --> 01:53.275
Prick is in the club
three nights a week.

01:53.275 --> 01:54.896
He can't cut me a break?

01:57.206 --> 01:58.655
They get you for D.U.I.?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.379
Aggravated assault.

02:03.413 --> 02:06.448
Some bitch from California
tried to fuck my husband

02:06.448 --> 02:08.896
so I beat her with
a beer bottle.

02:08.896 --> 02:12.000
So, you're like
a fucking criminal.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.689
I am the wrath
of a woman scorned.

02:13.689 --> 02:14.896
Call it what you will.

02:16.413 --> 02:19.793
It's always some
bitch from California.

02:19.793 --> 02:20.862
Every fucking time.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.379
Bethany Dutton.
Let's go.

02:27.413 --> 02:29.068
You don't look like a Bethany.

02:29.068 --> 02:32.586
I'm not a Bethany.
I'm a Beth.

02:45.103 --> 02:46.517
My hero.

02:46.517 --> 02:47.931
Knock when you're done.

02:52.137 --> 02:55.793
Boy, you have really
fucking done it this time.

02:55.793 --> 02:57.793
What's the big deal, Jamie?

02:57.793 --> 03:00.413
I got into
a bar fight in Bozeman.

03:00.413 --> 03:02.310
I mean,
Montana Board of Tourism

03:02.310 --> 03:04.034
should put that on
fucking t-shirts.

03:04.034 --> 03:06.034
I don't think the Montana
Board of Tourism

03:06.034 --> 03:08.344
is too fond of locals
beating the shit

03:08.344 --> 03:10.551
out of tourists on vacation.

03:10.551 --> 03:12.413
Well, that's why I called you.

03:12.413 --> 03:15.068
You can find the rug to
sweep this under, right?

03:15.068 --> 03:16.724
There is no rug
for this one, Beth.

03:16.724 --> 03:18.482
It's a County Attorney issue.

03:18.482 --> 03:21.379
So your best bet is to hope this
woman has a plane to catch

03:21.379 --> 03:23.551
or she's too hungover
to come down here

03:23.551 --> 03:25.379
and file formal charges.

03:25.379 --> 03:28.103
This is your
legal advice?

03:28.103 --> 03:29.448
Sit here and hope?

03:29.448 --> 03:34.620
It's not advice.
It's your only option.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.344
If she doesn't file charges,

03:36.344 --> 03:38.413
and that's a big fucking "if"
considering the photo

03:38.413 --> 03:41.413
I saw of the grapefruit
on her forehead,

03:41.413 --> 03:43.793
then I will ask the
County Attorney

03:43.793 --> 03:46.862
to show some mercy based on
your diminished capacity

03:46.862 --> 03:48.793
to control your
fucking emotions.

03:50.793 --> 03:55.517
So, yeah, you just sit
here and hope.

03:58.517 --> 04:02.137
But no matter what,
if this reaches the press,

04:02.137 --> 04:03.137
it's a big embarrassment
for our father.

04:03.137 --> 04:04.448
You mean my father.

04:06.034 --> 04:08.896
Your father's out of chances to
be embarrassed, isn't he, Jamie?

04:10.344 --> 04:12.827
I'm going to go back
to my cell.

04:12.827 --> 04:14.931
I'm going to take a nap.

04:14.931 --> 04:17.896
And you're going to sit on
the fucking steps of this place

04:17.896 --> 04:20.103
and you're going to wait
for Miss California

04:20.103 --> 04:24.655
to walk up, and when she does,
you are going to stop her.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.931
How the hell am
I going to do that?

04:28.310 --> 04:29.931
It's not my problem, Jamie.

06:06.689 --> 06:09.413
Hey. You got this Dutton
assault case?

06:09.413 --> 06:11.103
Uh, yes, sir.

06:11.103 --> 06:14.206
Why no charges against
the complainant?

06:14.206 --> 06:15.620
It was a bar fight, wasn't it?

06:15.620 --> 06:17.724
It was one hell of
a bar fight from the report.

06:17.724 --> 06:20.689
There is no self defense
in a bar fight,

06:20.689 --> 06:22.655
which is to say the victim
is a defendant as well.

06:22.655 --> 06:24.103
Is she coming in?

06:24.103 --> 06:27.344
- I'm waiting for her now.
- I'll wait with you.

06:39.034 --> 06:42.586
You have the Montana
Educators Luncheon at noon.

06:42.586 --> 06:44.655
Cancel it.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.689
Governor, I think that
sends the wrong message.

06:46.689 --> 06:51.206
All right, who exactly attends
the Montana Educators Luncheon?

06:51.206 --> 06:53.620
Everyone.
Senator Perry will be there.

06:53.620 --> 06:55.413
Legislators,
School Superintendents,

06:55.413 --> 06:56.896
the President of Montana State.

06:56.896 --> 06:58.655
Why do they call it
the Educators Euncheon

06:58.655 --> 07:00.172
if there's no educators there?

07:01.896 --> 07:05.344
It's Thursday, Clara, all
the educators are in school.

07:05.344 --> 07:07.103
Tell you what, when the
Educators' Luncheon

07:07.103 --> 07:09.482
is about teachers, I'll go.

07:17.827 --> 07:19.206
Who are they?

07:19.206 --> 07:20.724
It's the policy
advisors' meeting.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.689
Policy advisors for who?

07:26.137 --> 07:27.482
For you.

07:31.275 --> 07:32.896
How can my policy advisors
have a meeting

07:32.896 --> 07:34.655
about policies without me?

07:35.896 --> 07:37.275
Um...

07:54.206 --> 07:55.344
You're in my seat.

07:57.931 --> 08:01.689
So what policies are
we discussing today?

08:05.758 --> 08:06.758
Nobody?

08:08.620 --> 08:10.103
Let's see...

08:12.482 --> 08:14.758
"In accordance with the
U.S. Green initiative,

08:14.758 --> 08:18.724
"Montana is leasing 7,000 acres
in Powder River County

08:18.724 --> 08:21.620
to Sun Energies."

08:21.620 --> 08:23.551
What is Sun Energies?

08:23.551 --> 08:26.620
It's a solar farm company.

08:26.620 --> 08:29.413
Mm. And you are?

08:29.413 --> 08:31.448
Stanley... Roberts.

08:31.448 --> 08:33.275
And you are?

08:33.275 --> 08:35.758
Your chief policy advisor,
Mr. Governor.

08:35.758 --> 08:38.103
Well, nice to
fucking meet you.

08:38.103 --> 08:40.344
I tried to schedule
a lunch but you're...

08:40.344 --> 08:42.310
She said you aren't
taking lunches.

08:43.413 --> 08:45.310
Where's your office, Stanley?

08:45.310 --> 08:47.344
Just... Right down the hall.

08:47.344 --> 08:49.655
Know what?
So is mine.

08:49.655 --> 08:53.000
Ever dawn on you just
to come by and say howdy?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.344
My mistake.

08:55.344 --> 08:56.862
I'd say.

08:56.862 --> 09:01.344
Let's see what other
policies I'm proposing.

09:01.344 --> 09:03.965
Suspend natural gas leases
on state land

09:03.965 --> 09:05.862
in Powder River County
to support

09:05.862 --> 09:08.000
the Sage Grouse
Restoration Project.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.793
Um, there's been a precipitous
drop in sage grouse numbers

09:16.793 --> 09:18.655
and there is empirical evidence

09:18.655 --> 09:20.896
that gas exploration
and extraction

09:20.896 --> 09:24.931
have a negative impact on
the sage grouse environment.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.724
And what effect do you
think seven thousand acres

09:26.724 --> 09:29.517
of solar panels are going to
have on their environment?

09:29.517 --> 09:32.551
There's... no evidence that
solar panels

09:32.551 --> 09:34.620
would have any impact on
the sage grouse environment.

09:34.620 --> 09:35.827
What do they do
with the sage brush

09:35.827 --> 09:37.620
when they put
in the solar panels?

09:37.620 --> 09:40.448
They, they...

09:40.448 --> 09:42.965
They would clear it before
putting in the solar panels.

09:42.965 --> 09:45.137
They remove the sage brush.

09:45.137 --> 09:47.413
Yes, sir.

09:47.413 --> 09:49.448
Sage grouse live
in the sage brush.

09:50.793 --> 09:52.068
They do.

09:52.068 --> 09:54.206
And you don't think
removing the sage brush

09:54.206 --> 09:56.241
is going to have an effect
on the population?

09:56.241 --> 09:58.758
I just said there's
no evidence--

09:58.758 --> 10:01.068
Know what scares me about
you, Stanley? You're serious.

10:02.724 --> 10:05.137
You're looking at me
and you're not joking.

10:05.137 --> 10:06.793
I think tops
on my agenda today

10:06.793 --> 10:10.793
is going to be budget
discipline. You're all fired.

10:10.793 --> 10:12.551
I'm very mindful of
our tax payers' money,

10:12.551 --> 10:14.275
and you are all wasting it.

10:14.275 --> 10:16.793
I'll advise myself
on policy, Clara.

10:16.793 --> 10:19.413
How much money
did we just save?

10:19.413 --> 10:21.206
I would say...

10:21.206 --> 10:23.965
Roughly 1.6 Million dollars
in salary and benefits

10:23.965 --> 10:25.413
if you're serious.

10:25.413 --> 10:27.034
Oh, I'm pretty serious.

10:30.448 --> 10:31.517
Look at that.

10:33.482 --> 10:35.379
What a great day
for the State of Montana.

10:35.379 --> 10:37.241
Where to next?

10:37.241 --> 10:39.931
We have an emergency meeting
with park officials

10:39.931 --> 10:41.689
and U.S. Fish and Wildlife.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.000
Emergency meeting about what?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.551
Doesn't say.

10:46.551 --> 10:48.034
Usually means someone
died in the park.

10:48.034 --> 10:49.310
They're in your office.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.827
What's the emergency?

10:56.827 --> 11:00.379
Governor, we'd like for you
to take a look at this map.

11:00.379 --> 11:03.344
The red lines indicate the
path of a radio-collared wolf

11:03.344 --> 11:06.344
associated with the
Rescue Creek pack.

11:06.344 --> 11:07.793
All right.

11:07.793 --> 11:08.931
As you can see...

11:08.931 --> 11:10.655
Wherever we see
these clusters,

11:10.655 --> 11:12.793
we associate with a kill site.

11:12.793 --> 11:15.620
They'll feed on a carcass for a
few days, then they'll move on.

11:15.620 --> 11:19.172
They left the park here
roughly three weeks ago,

11:19.172 --> 11:21.068
they traveled the tree
line to here,

11:21.068 --> 11:23.517
then they dropped down in
this valley to here.

11:25.793 --> 11:27.344
Mm hm.

11:27.344 --> 11:29.517
That's my ranch.

11:29.517 --> 11:30.689
We're aware.

11:32.034 --> 11:33.620
The wolves clustered here
for three days,

11:33.620 --> 11:36.034
around what appears
to be a kill,

11:36.034 --> 11:39.344
then they move straight south
for thirty miles to here.

11:41.206 --> 11:42.896
Now, that's the
Yellowstone River...

11:42.896 --> 11:46.172
They jump into the river,
according to this data

11:46.172 --> 11:48.068
and they swim downstream
for five miles.

11:49.344 --> 11:52.482
Wasn't aware wolves
swam down rivers.

11:52.482 --> 11:53.965
They don't.

11:53.965 --> 11:57.000
We recovered one of the radio
collars from the river.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.689
What are you getting at?

11:58.689 --> 12:00.724
We think the wolves were
killed on your ranch

12:00.724 --> 12:03.206
and the collars transported
back to the park.

12:07.517 --> 12:10.448
You think my cowboys
killed those wolves.

12:10.448 --> 12:13.000
We think your cowboys
killed those wolves.

12:28.275 --> 12:29.551
<i>Yes sir?</i>

12:29.551 --> 12:31.965
We had any wolves
messing with the cattle?

12:31.965 --> 12:34.379
<i>Wolves? No sir.</i>

12:34.379 --> 12:37.620
<i>Fish and Wildlife came
by asking the same thing.</i>

12:37.620 --> 12:38.689
All right.

12:41.551 --> 12:43.103
There you have it.

12:43.103 --> 12:45.724
Look, if they get
into your cattle

12:45.724 --> 12:48.413
you gotta do what you gotta do.

12:48.413 --> 12:52.344
My guess: they shot them
from a distance

12:52.344 --> 12:54.793
didn't notice the collar,

12:54.793 --> 12:57.344
got spooked and tried
to cover their tracks.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.862
These radio collars
aren't monitored by us.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.068
An NGO pays for this research,

13:02.068 --> 13:03.793
and they have
the same data we have

13:03.793 --> 13:06.517
and they are going to draw
the same conclusion.

13:06.517 --> 13:08.758
When they do,

13:08.758 --> 13:10.862
they will come after you
with both barrels, Governor.

13:12.034 --> 13:13.413
Look forward to it.

13:14.551 --> 13:15.655
Anything else?

13:17.310 --> 13:19.344
Thank you, gentlemen.
Governor, we have the--

13:19.344 --> 13:20.724
Yep.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.896
Environmental groups
can be a real problem.

13:34.896 --> 13:37.068
Yeah, you don't say.

13:42.586 --> 13:43.862
This is Clara.

13:43.862 --> 13:46.482
<i>It's Jamie,
let me speak to him.</i>

13:46.482 --> 13:47.896
Attorney general.

13:49.137 --> 13:50.620
Yeah?

13:50.620 --> 13:52.551
All right, there is a good
chance I can make this go away.

13:52.551 --> 13:57.275
But, in case I can't,
I need you to know

13:57.275 --> 13:59.448
<i>that I'm in police station
in Bozeman</i>

13:59.448 --> 14:01.344
<i>hoping to convince
a young woman to drop</i>

14:01.344 --> 14:03.862
the aggravated assault
charges she plans

14:03.862 --> 14:05.551
to file against your daughter.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.965
This fucking day.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.241
Can I, uh...

14:14.241 --> 14:16.482
<i>Can I have a little
more context, Jamie?</i>

14:16.482 --> 14:19.206
Yeah, she mouthed
off to Beth in a bar

14:19.206 --> 14:22.137
and it went about
how you'd expect.

14:22.137 --> 14:25.344
<i>All right.
Just, uh, keep me posted.</i>

14:27.241 --> 14:32.379
Is there a crisis manager
on my team, by any chance?

14:32.379 --> 14:36.310
Well, that would be your press
secretary who you never hired,

14:36.310 --> 14:39.379
so I guess your crisis
manager is me.

14:41.620 --> 14:43.344
Can I have a minute?

14:44.931 --> 14:46.344
<i>Having fun yet?</i>

14:46.344 --> 14:48.344
No chance you'd
want to change jobs?

14:48.344 --> 14:49.965
<i>You'd hate
this one more.</i>

14:51.655 --> 14:53.379
Any chance you're in Helena?

14:53.379 --> 14:55.068
<i>A good chance.</i>

14:55.068 --> 14:57.965
- Lunch plans?
<i>- Not anymore.</i>

14:57.965 --> 15:00.172
<i>You know Benny's Bistro?</i>
- Sure.

15:00.172 --> 15:02.482
Noon?
<i>- You made my day.</i>

15:02.482 --> 15:06.000
Yeah, maybe you can make mine.
See you in a bit.

15:20.379 --> 15:21.344
Yes, sir.

15:32.793 --> 15:33.931
Miss Brewer.

15:33.931 --> 15:35.862
I understand you'd
like to press.

15:35.862 --> 15:37.275
Very much.

15:41.965 --> 15:44.931
I feel I must point
out that by doing so,

15:44.931 --> 15:47.586
you are exposing
yourself to prosecution.

15:47.586 --> 15:50.551
How am I doing that?

15:50.551 --> 15:53.344
There is no self defense
claim in a bar fight.

15:53.344 --> 15:55.793
I assume you had been drinking,
and I understand you

15:55.793 --> 15:59.000
approached Miss Dutton
and instigated the incident.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.379
I didn't instigate anything.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.758
Oh, um...

16:05.517 --> 16:07.241
Let me see.

16:07.241 --> 16:09.896
Yeah, you approached
Miss Dutton and stated,

16:09.896 --> 16:12.793
"I'm taking your husband home.

16:12.793 --> 16:14.310
"You can come with us and watch

16:14.310 --> 16:17.275
or he can tell you
about it tomorrow."

16:17.275 --> 16:19.655
Are those not your words?

16:20.965 --> 16:22.034
I mean...

16:22.034 --> 16:23.793
I was kidding.

16:24.793 --> 16:26.000
Mm.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.827
She didn't find it very funny.

16:28.931 --> 16:29.931
No shit.

16:32.586 --> 16:36.000
Making statements or actions
that threaten harm to another

16:36.000 --> 16:40.310
or make them feel
they are in danger is assault.

16:40.310 --> 16:42.034
You don't have to hit
somebody to commit assault,

16:42.034 --> 16:43.827
you just have to
present a threat.

16:43.827 --> 16:46.379
You presented the threat.

16:46.379 --> 16:48.482
So if you press charges

16:48.482 --> 16:50.206
the state must
press charges against you.

16:50.206 --> 16:52.206
And since you are not
a resident of Montana,

16:52.206 --> 16:55.965
you present a flight risk
and you bail will be withheld.

16:55.965 --> 16:58.310
Do you understand
what that means?

16:58.310 --> 17:01.137
So she just...

17:01.137 --> 17:02.551
She just gets away with it?

17:02.551 --> 17:04.137
She didn't get away
with anything.

17:04.137 --> 17:05.482
She spent the night in jail
and she's going to be charged

17:05.482 --> 17:09.034
with disorderly conduct.

17:09.034 --> 17:11.034
The choice is yours.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.034
I can't wait to get
out of this state.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.517
Those fucking hillbillies.

17:17.517 --> 17:19.206
Well, the feeling is mutual.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.068
May I leave?

17:21.068 --> 17:22.586
Please.

17:28.551 --> 17:30.137
Saved me a ton of paperwork.

17:31.275 --> 17:32.275
Thanks.

17:34.689 --> 17:36.172
Happy to help.

18:55.344 --> 18:56.655
What're they doing?

18:56.655 --> 18:58.655
For Kayce's boy is my guess.

19:25.034 --> 19:26.551
They told us this spot.

19:26.551 --> 19:28.793
If I would've known I would
have dug that hole for you.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.724
We don't mind.
It's part of the ceremony.

19:31.724 --> 19:33.275
There's a dead horse over there.

19:33.275 --> 19:34.482
When did he die?

19:34.482 --> 19:35.965
He died Monday.

19:35.965 --> 19:37.931
I got an excavator coming
out tomorrow to bury him.

19:37.931 --> 19:39.241
We'll bury him now.

19:39.241 --> 19:41.137
We'll put him in the ground
beside the boy.

19:43.206 --> 19:44.172
Can I ask you why?

19:46.310 --> 19:49.137
You can ask,
but I ain't gonna answer.

19:49.137 --> 19:51.103
Kayce's all right
with this, then?

19:51.103 --> 19:52.517
He knows.

19:53.827 --> 19:55.620
Well, you're gonna
need a big hole.

19:55.620 --> 19:57.965
Jake, Ethan,
run back to the barn

19:57.965 --> 20:00.275
and grab us a bunch of shovels.

20:00.275 --> 20:02.137
I'll help you, Mo.

20:31.275 --> 20:32.551
Thank you.

20:43.724 --> 20:45.379
Don't wish for
what you don't want.

20:47.344 --> 20:49.206
You're in it now, John.
You might as well accept it.

20:50.482 --> 20:51.862
All right.

20:51.862 --> 20:57.344
Explain this job to me,
because it makes no sense.

20:57.344 --> 21:01.103
All I do is go to middle
schools and ribbon cuttings.

21:01.103 --> 21:02.896
Well, when the legislature's
in session

21:02.896 --> 21:05.896
you'll be praying
for ribbon cuttings.

21:05.896 --> 21:08.965
At the end of the day,
Montana is a business--

21:08.965 --> 21:12.517
12,000 employees,
600,000 customers,

21:12.517 --> 21:15.137
and you're the CEO,
and that's all there is.

21:15.137 --> 21:16.586
And you really need to change
your perspective

21:16.586 --> 21:18.655
about these
school meetings, too.

21:18.655 --> 21:20.827
You know, these kids are gonna
remember meeting the governor

21:20.827 --> 21:22.448
for the rest of their lives.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.862
And who knows, you might
even inspire one of them

21:23.862 --> 21:25.551
to become the governor
one day.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.000
I mean, that's how
I was inspired.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.379
All right, point taken.

21:29.379 --> 21:31.827
I stepped on a few
land mines it appears.

21:31.827 --> 21:33.413
Already?

21:33.413 --> 21:35.310
Others stepped on them for me.

21:35.310 --> 21:40.310
Seems my daughter
got herself into a bar fight

21:40.310 --> 21:42.896
and has been arrested.

21:42.896 --> 21:45.827
I'm sorry.
It's not funny.

21:45.827 --> 21:48.620
I can see how that's funny
to anybody but me.

21:48.620 --> 21:51.655
All right, well, if it doesn't
go away, just ignore it.

21:51.655 --> 21:53.862
You don't comment
on your personal family.

21:53.862 --> 21:56.413
You love your daughter and hope
she learns from her mistakes.

21:56.413 --> 21:58.862
If she's convicted,
what are my...

21:58.862 --> 22:00.275
what are my options?

22:00.275 --> 22:02.551
You have none.

22:02.551 --> 22:05.172
Well, I take that back,
you could pardon her,

22:05.172 --> 22:09.310
but that's officially the end
of your political career, so...

22:09.310 --> 22:12.103
I don't have to wait
until the end of my term

22:12.103 --> 22:13.482
to pardon someone?

22:13.482 --> 22:15.137
I would strongly advise it

22:15.137 --> 22:17.896
but no, you have the
authority to pardon,

22:17.896 --> 22:20.068
to commute sentence,
grant clemency,

22:20.068 --> 22:21.517
whenever you want.

22:21.517 --> 22:23.172
But once you open that
Pandora's Box,

22:23.172 --> 22:25.965
it does not close, so...

22:25.965 --> 22:27.206
Next land mine?

22:29.241 --> 22:32.310
Environmental groups
relating to...

22:32.310 --> 22:33.448
wolves.

22:33.448 --> 22:37.379
- Avoid them at all costs.
- Yeah.

22:37.379 --> 22:39.344
Buffalo and wolves were
the bane of my two terms.

22:39.344 --> 22:40.655
They are kryptonite.

22:40.655 --> 22:43.241
You need to stay away
and try like hell

22:43.241 --> 22:44.862
to avoid taking a position.

22:44.862 --> 22:48.137
And you need to get
an environmental advisor.

22:48.137 --> 22:51.206
Not one of your rancher buddies,
an environmentalist.

22:51.206 --> 22:54.137
Someone who understands
the way that they think

22:54.137 --> 22:58.586
so they can explain to you what
the hell it is they're thinking.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.517
Here's my best
advice about this job.

23:00.517 --> 23:03.000
Good governors
initiate action,

23:03.000 --> 23:07.586
and bad governors spend
all their time reacting.

23:07.586 --> 23:10.517
There are plenty of things
to clean up besides an airport.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.241
You're the only man I know
who would actually pout

23:18.241 --> 23:21.172
over winning
the election that he entered.

23:21.172 --> 23:22.517
I'm not pouting.

23:24.310 --> 23:29.655
Skulking, maybe,
but... not pouting.

23:29.655 --> 23:34.448
You know, this is as much
your legacy as that ranch.

23:37.206 --> 23:38.793
You're a smart woman, Lynelle.

23:38.793 --> 23:41.758
Oh, you're just
figuring that out?

23:41.758 --> 23:44.517
Just enjoy your lunch, John.
It's on me.

24:01.172 --> 24:03.103
Disorderly conduct?

24:04.793 --> 24:06.068
Way to go.

24:06.068 --> 24:07.379
You're welcome.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.689
Now I gotta pick up trash
on the highway

24:09.689 --> 24:11.103
with all my fucking free time.

24:16.793 --> 24:18.137
Which car is yours?

24:18.137 --> 24:19.758
I can't take you back.
I have to go to Helena.

24:19.758 --> 24:22.482
- Which one?
- I'm serious.

24:22.482 --> 24:24.689
Well, how do you want me
to get home, Jamie?

24:24.689 --> 24:28.413
Huh? Want me to hike
my skirt up on the on-ramp?

24:29.862 --> 24:31.068
I doubt it'd be
the first time.

24:51.275 --> 24:52.655
What the fuck is that?

24:52.655 --> 24:53.965
What's what?

24:53.965 --> 24:55.931
The baby seat.
What the fuck is that for?

24:55.931 --> 24:57.000
You have a child?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.379
Do you have a child, Jamie?

25:07.896 --> 25:09.068
A boy.

25:19.551 --> 25:21.000
God gave you a boy?

25:25.275 --> 25:27.931
You have my womb
cut out of me...

25:29.655 --> 25:31.724
and God gave you a boy?

25:39.827 --> 25:40.931
Fuck you!

25:45.172 --> 25:46.275
Beth?

25:46.275 --> 25:47.758
Let me guess, is it
that brood mare

25:47.758 --> 25:49.448
of a fucking campaign manager?

25:49.448 --> 25:52.620
- Yes.
- I saw her coming.

25:53.689 --> 25:55.172
Beth.

25:55.172 --> 25:58.448
Come on, Beth.
Beth, stop, stop, stop!

25:58.448 --> 26:03.551
Taking you to that clinic is
the greatest regret of my life.

26:03.551 --> 26:06.068
Of all the awful shit
that you have done

26:06.068 --> 26:08.275
in your 45 years on this planet,

26:08.275 --> 26:11.206
Jamie, that is... that is
really saying something.

26:11.206 --> 26:12.379
What...

26:13.620 --> 26:15.344
What did you name him?

26:17.482 --> 26:18.586
He's named after me.

26:22.517 --> 26:24.137
Of course he is!

26:24.137 --> 26:25.551
That's what the world
fucking needs.

26:25.551 --> 26:26.655
Another fucking you.

26:26.655 --> 26:28.310
Beth.

26:30.137 --> 26:31.620
Dad doesn't know about this.
Nobody knows about this.

26:31.620 --> 26:33.482
Don't worry
about me telling him.

26:37.827 --> 26:39.827
I'm gonna take him
from you.

26:39.827 --> 26:44.241
I'm going to rob you
of fatherhood, Jamie.

26:44.241 --> 26:46.310
You don't deserve it.

26:46.310 --> 26:47.896
And he deserves
better than you.

26:49.620 --> 26:51.482
Next time you see him,
you can kiss him goodbye,

26:51.482 --> 26:55.000
because he's as good as gone.

28:19.620 --> 28:21.068
Car trouble?

28:23.448 --> 28:26.689
Actually, I just
got out of jail.

28:26.689 --> 28:28.482
And when they let you out,
they just let you out,

28:28.482 --> 28:30.862
there's no, uh,
no phone call to a friend

28:30.862 --> 28:32.551
or a bus ticket.

28:32.551 --> 28:35.620
Just, you know, let you
out on the street.

28:39.482 --> 28:43.310
Seems an unfair policy
toward one who is clearly

28:43.310 --> 28:48.000
having trouble coping
in society, don't you think?

28:49.172 --> 28:51.931
Definitely creates, uh...

28:51.931 --> 28:54.620
Additional challenges for sure.

28:54.620 --> 28:55.689
Right?

28:58.310 --> 29:00.275
- Do you need a...
- Ride?

29:01.586 --> 29:03.000
I'd love one.

29:08.379 --> 29:09.413
Thank you.

29:11.827 --> 29:13.827
What are the odds
that you have a cigarette?

29:14.517 --> 29:15.896
Not good.

29:19.344 --> 29:21.482
Well, aren't you cute?

29:21.482 --> 29:24.172
Mom's gonna kill you, Dad.

29:24.172 --> 29:26.103
Is Mom the jealous type?

29:26.103 --> 29:28.275
Mom wears the pants,
if you know what I mean.

29:30.310 --> 29:35.000
Sister, I know exactly
what you mean.

29:59.068 --> 30:00.620
Stop the car.

31:10.137 --> 31:11.448
Nobody told me.

31:13.448 --> 31:15.137
He didn't tell anybody.

31:16.310 --> 31:18.758
Just pulled up and saw
all the cars.

31:21.827 --> 31:25.103
Should we, uh, get closer?

31:27.517 --> 31:29.724
I think this is as close
as they want us, Dad.

31:40.379 --> 31:41.724
So how was jail?

31:43.586 --> 31:45.103
Loud-mouthed pussy.

31:45.103 --> 31:46.620
You and I are going to
have a long talk later.

31:46.620 --> 31:48.206
Yeah, well, I'm going
to sleep later.

31:48.206 --> 31:49.551
We'll have a short
one now then.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.793
Impulse control.

31:54.793 --> 31:55.793
Find some.

32:14.896 --> 32:16.413
I don't think
they want us here.

32:17.827 --> 32:20.862
Even if they don't want us,

32:20.862 --> 32:22.724
they need to know
we care enough to stay.

32:26.689 --> 32:28.379
Make me a promise.

32:28.379 --> 32:31.068
Don't ever let them
do that to me.

32:31.068 --> 32:33.172
Turn me to ashes
and throw me to the wind.

32:34.758 --> 32:36.103
That's all the care I want.

33:42.724 --> 33:43.931
John.

33:45.172 --> 33:46.724
I'm not sure the protocol.

33:46.724 --> 33:49.448
There's no protocol now.

33:49.448 --> 33:50.862
Ceremony's over.

33:52.551 --> 33:54.103
I wish I'd known.

33:55.551 --> 33:57.448
Grief isn't meant
to be shared.

33:59.310 --> 34:02.034
But comfort is.

34:02.034 --> 34:03.137
They could use some now.

34:10.896 --> 34:12.310
John...

34:13.965 --> 34:17.517
This isn't the place
but we do need to talk.

34:18.586 --> 34:20.137
About what?

34:20.137 --> 34:22.379
About the three hundred jobs
you eliminated

34:22.379 --> 34:26.172
when you canceled
the airport project.

34:26.172 --> 34:29.068
A lot of very unhappy
people on the Reservation.

34:29.068 --> 34:33.000
Can you meet me at
the Capitol tomorrow?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.793
I think you should
meet me on the Reservation.

34:35.793 --> 34:38.068
Show the people
you care enough to visit.

34:41.551 --> 34:42.586
I can do that.

35:06.862 --> 35:08.137
I know how you feel.

35:10.275 --> 35:13.724
I wished I didn't, but I do.

35:16.275 --> 35:19.931
I buried a son
right over there.

35:19.931 --> 35:21.172
I remember.

35:25.689 --> 35:27.103
Blaming yourself, aren't you?

35:28.896 --> 35:31.896
Yeah, I did that, too.

35:33.068 --> 35:34.862
Still do some days.

35:36.862 --> 35:40.827
I'll tell you something
I've never told anybody.

35:40.827 --> 35:43.034
I had a brother
for about eighteen hours.

35:43.034 --> 35:45.344
His name was Peter.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.827
He was born early,

35:47.827 --> 35:51.448
and his little heart
wasn't strong enough.

35:51.448 --> 35:53.517
Not much they
could do back in those days.

35:53.517 --> 35:56.517
Not a lot they can do now.

35:57.896 --> 36:01.068
So, they just gave him
back to my mother.

36:01.068 --> 36:03.931
The doctors hoped
and we prayed and...

36:03.931 --> 36:05.241
neither worked.

36:06.448 --> 36:08.448
And it changed my mother.
It hardened her.

36:08.448 --> 36:12.517
She never... she never tried
to have children again.

36:13.896 --> 36:17.724
Years later, I was grown
and Lee had just been born.

36:17.724 --> 36:21.862
Both my parents are looking at
him, taking turns holding him.

36:21.862 --> 36:24.689
And my father got white
as a ghost,

36:24.689 --> 36:27.862
looked at my mother and said,

36:27.862 --> 36:29.517
"Peter lived a perfect life.

36:30.896 --> 36:33.310
"All he saw of this planet
was you

36:33.310 --> 36:36.000
and all he knew
was you loved him."

36:39.758 --> 36:41.586
That boy lived
a perfect life, Monica.

36:41.586 --> 36:43.620
We're the only ones
who know it was brief.

36:44.896 --> 36:48.000
All he knew was you
and that you loved him.

36:58.758 --> 37:00.241
Thank you.

37:35.448 --> 37:36.655
Named him after me.

37:39.103 --> 37:40.310
I did.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.793
Means more than
you'll ever know, son.

37:46.517 --> 37:47.517
I know what it means.

37:52.275 --> 37:53.310
Yeah.

37:55.413 --> 37:57.620
Hang on to this.

37:57.620 --> 37:59.068
Even if you don't use it,

37:59.068 --> 38:02.793
now is not the time
to stop drawing a paycheck.

38:06.655 --> 38:08.965
I'll find someone
to take your place

38:08.965 --> 38:10.482
if that's what you want.

38:13.137 --> 38:14.586
It's what I want.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Looks like you
got tossed off one.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.896
Just been digging graves.

38:46.896 --> 38:49.758
Horses go in the field,
you know that.

38:49.758 --> 38:52.379
Yeah, I know but they wanted
it beside the boy.

38:52.379 --> 38:53.620
Didn't figure you'd say no.

38:55.965 --> 38:57.172
They say why?

38:58.689 --> 39:02.206
My guess is the boy has
something to ride into Heaven.

39:05.482 --> 39:07.275
Uh, the Poison Creek outfit,
they reached out,

39:07.275 --> 39:08.827
they're short handed to brand.

39:08.827 --> 39:12.172
They wanted our help so,
if you're all right with it,

39:12.172 --> 39:13.172
go over there tomorrow.

39:13.172 --> 39:15.517
When are we starting?

39:15.517 --> 39:17.068
Well, next week.

39:17.068 --> 39:18.551
You plan on being
here, don't you?

39:18.551 --> 39:20.551
I mean, it's not my place to--

39:20.551 --> 39:23.379
- I'll be here.
- All right.

39:27.310 --> 39:29.931
Park Rangers came
and asked me

39:29.931 --> 39:32.896
some question about wolves
that held up here.

39:32.896 --> 39:35.931
You know anything about that?

39:35.931 --> 39:39.586
Mm. They pulled down a cow,

39:39.586 --> 39:42.241
and I asked Ryan to
go out and shoot 'em.

39:42.241 --> 39:45.310
He shot the ones with
the damn collars on 'em.

39:45.310 --> 39:49.000
I was worried that it was going
to cause you a problem

39:49.000 --> 39:52.344
so I tried to outsmart 'em
and I guess I didn't.

39:52.344 --> 39:54.655
So, I'm sorry, sir.

39:54.655 --> 39:56.655
Where are the wolves now?

39:56.655 --> 39:58.827
In a place that nobody
will ever find them.

40:09.241 --> 40:11.965
Horses in heaven.

40:11.965 --> 40:14.034
Mm-hm. That's the best
I could figure it.

40:18.344 --> 40:19.413

Bout the same as last year.

44:23.793 --> 44:26.931
But we won't add any
yearlings this year though.

44:26.931 --> 44:29.862
Not with diesel
prices and corn.

44:29.862 --> 44:32.448
- No.
- Shit.

44:32.448 --> 44:34.758
When this finally
makes it to the butcher shop,

44:34.758 --> 44:36.172
it's gonna sting.

44:39.137 --> 44:40.793
It's good to see
your boy back.

44:42.586 --> 44:44.724
It's just for the summer.

44:44.724 --> 44:49.275
He graduated,
got a job in Boise.

44:49.275 --> 44:51.931
But my daughter wants to stay.

44:51.931 --> 44:53.689
We'll see if I can
make a cowboy out of her

44:53.689 --> 44:56.758
shit-for-brains husband.

44:56.758 --> 44:59.068
Only thing he seems
to like making is babies.

44:59.068 --> 45:00.551
Is that right?

45:01.793 --> 45:06.137
World sure is shrinking
where you are.

45:06.137 --> 45:08.689
It's good to see that
airport squashed.

45:08.689 --> 45:11.275
That ain't gonna
change nothing, Delbert.

45:11.275 --> 45:14.931
I mean, shit, it might
slow it down a bit.

45:14.931 --> 45:17.793
At least the world hasn't found
out about this place yet.

45:19.896 --> 45:22.689
It breaks my heart to think
of the world we're leaving them.

45:24.448 --> 45:25.620
Breaks my heart, too.

45:27.482 --> 45:29.068
Hell, I don't even have
any kids.

45:55.172 --> 45:56.793
Higgins.

46:43.103 --> 46:45.310
What took you so long?

46:46.379 --> 46:48.034
I've only been
Governor a week.

46:50.241 --> 46:51.724
I see you survived.

46:52.862 --> 46:55.620
- Thank you.
- Well, there's a catch.

46:55.620 --> 46:57.413
A catch?

46:57.413 --> 46:59.379
Yeah, it's a supervised
release for six months.

46:59.379 --> 47:01.448
Supervised by who?

47:02.551 --> 47:03.551
You're looking at him.

47:05.103 --> 47:08.344
So, you release me from
prison just to kidnap me?

47:08.344 --> 47:11.724
More or less.
Need your help.

47:11.724 --> 47:13.586
With what?

47:13.586 --> 47:15.413
Help me understand you.

47:15.413 --> 47:18.482
Help me understand
the way you think.

47:18.482 --> 47:20.517
What do I get in return?

47:20.517 --> 47:23.103
You just got it.
Get in.

47:23.103 --> 47:25.517
- Where am I staying?
- With me.

47:26.689 --> 47:28.344
I'm no political strategist

47:28.344 --> 47:30.724
but granting clemency to a woman
you're shacking up with

47:30.724 --> 47:33.413
in the Governor's mansion lends
itself to some negative press.

47:33.413 --> 47:34.896
At the ranch.

47:34.896 --> 47:37.896
Oh, great. With your bi-polar
sociopathic daughter?

47:37.896 --> 47:39.482
She's hardly ever there.

47:44.551 --> 47:47.655
So you know, I just
went a year without sex,

47:47.655 --> 47:50.241
which is the longest I've gone
since the first time I had it,

47:50.241 --> 47:52.517
and I'm still not fucking you.

47:52.517 --> 47:55.655
Oh, God.

47:55.655 --> 47:58.172
Our relationship will
be purely professional.

48:04.034 --> 48:05.517
Let her in.

48:26.344 --> 48:27.758
Miss Atwood.

48:27.758 --> 48:30.620
Oh, come on. It's Sarah.
Have a seat.

48:30.620 --> 48:33.103
I took the liberty of
ordering us a bottle of Rosé.

48:33.103 --> 48:36.068
I hope you don't mind.

48:36.068 --> 48:38.862
Well, can't say
I've ever had it.

48:38.862 --> 48:41.689
Oh. Well the French,

48:41.689 --> 48:44.172
they drink it
like water in the summer.

48:48.758 --> 48:50.068
Try it.

48:57.862 --> 48:59.206
It's refreshing.

49:03.413 --> 49:04.827
It's nice.

49:09.172 --> 49:10.793
What?

49:10.793 --> 49:15.103
Oh, I'm just trying to decide

49:15.103 --> 49:17.448
the best path forward.

49:17.448 --> 49:19.586
How do we manage this?

49:19.586 --> 49:22.344
How do we as
a company, recover?

49:22.344 --> 49:24.413
How do we save face?

49:24.413 --> 49:26.793
But most importantly, how
do we reverse his decision?

49:26.793 --> 49:29.586
Either reverse his decision
or get our money back.

49:29.586 --> 49:31.724
I mean, the state is facing
a multi-billion dollar lawsuit

49:31.724 --> 49:33.241
and you know it.

49:33.241 --> 49:35.103
You won't win.

49:35.103 --> 49:37.103
With some of the most
vital elements

49:37.103 --> 49:39.586
of your development now in
a Conservation Easement,

49:39.586 --> 49:41.103
the argument is moot.

49:43.413 --> 49:45.103
We don't have to win.

49:46.689 --> 49:49.896
We just need to keep it in
the news long enough

49:49.896 --> 49:52.275
to assassinate your
father's reputation

49:52.275 --> 49:55.655
and choose a politician
to support as the next governor.

49:57.689 --> 49:59.000
Hm.

50:00.379 --> 50:02.862
I'm getting ahead of myself.

50:05.103 --> 50:08.896
The purpose of this dinner
was to seek a soft landing.

50:08.896 --> 50:11.000
Not to threaten positions.

50:13.862 --> 50:16.689
Let's figure out if we can
even get along first.

50:19.862 --> 50:21.793
Are you hungry?

50:23.517 --> 50:25.137
Not really.

50:25.137 --> 50:26.758
Mm-mm. Me neither.

50:26.758 --> 50:29.172
I've had enough of
this fruity shit.

50:29.172 --> 50:32.586
[deep breath

50:32.586 --> 50:35.206
Do you want to go to the bar?

50:39.000 --> 50:40.206
Sure.

50:40.206 --> 50:41.931
Oh, that's not funny.

50:41.931 --> 50:45.896
Then why are you laughing?

50:45.896 --> 50:48.275
I'm laughing because
I'm uncomfortable.

50:48.275 --> 50:50.620
You're uncomfortable
because you find it funny.

50:55.689 --> 50:58.034
I'm dreading arguing
with you in court.

50:58.034 --> 51:00.275
You should.
You should.

51:00.275 --> 51:01.862
Yeah?

51:04.862 --> 51:07.000
How the hell are
you still single?

51:11.103 --> 51:14.655
Well...

51:14.655 --> 51:18.965
when you live on
a ranch an hour from town...

51:18.965 --> 51:22.344
an hour from anything...

51:22.344 --> 51:24.724
You don't live
on a ranch anymore.

51:27.103 --> 51:31.137
Hm. No, I don't.

51:33.758 --> 51:38.206
I'm feeling
a little irresponsible.

51:40.413 --> 51:41.413
Hm.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.379
I'm starting to
feel that way myself, too.

51:48.379 --> 51:50.103
Oh.

51:50.103 --> 51:52.103
Take me somewhere
and prove it.

51:54.965 --> 51:59.172
♪ But you know
I've always been ♪

51:59.172 --> 52:00.827
Follow me.

52:16.241 --> 52:18.793
Okay.
I don't hear anybody.

52:18.793 --> 52:19.931
Wow.

52:22.379 --> 52:23.965
This way.

52:25.103 --> 52:26.724
- You...
- No.

52:28.931 --> 52:31.551
This is what I call
a fucking bathroom.

53:02.620 --> 53:04.034
Wait. Wait...

53:04.034 --> 53:06.793
Who cares?
Let him listen.

54:28.793 --> 54:30.137
What are you doing?

54:31.275 --> 54:33.413
Nothing, baby.
Just thinking.

54:35.241 --> 54:37.068
Maybe you should think
about something different.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.793
I'd love to.
But... it ain't gonna happen.

54:45.137 --> 54:46.241
Go back to sleep.

54:58.517 --> 54:59.827
Who is this bitch?

55:10.551 --> 55:13.034
Yeah, not her real name.

55:13.034 --> 55:14.068
What a surprise.

55:51.275 --> 55:55.379
Our Justice system is in a
state of utter collapse, huh?

55:55.379 --> 55:59.413
And to think of all the hard
work I did to put you in prison.

55:59.413 --> 56:03.896
And think of all the hard work
I'm doing to stay out.

56:03.896 --> 56:05.689
And I do mean hard.

56:05.689 --> 56:09.034
I'll pick you up some
Doxycycline when I'm in town

56:09.034 --> 56:11.758
to kill whatever funk your
snatch caught in the clink.

56:11.758 --> 56:15.586
Mm. Thanks. Could you also
get me a toothbrush?

56:15.586 --> 56:18.103
I hate to keep using yours.

56:18.103 --> 56:19.586
Oh, well.
Back to work.

56:24.379 --> 56:26.000
I am not starting
this day sober.

57:26.620 --> 57:28.482
<i>Next time on Yellowstone...</i>

57:29.724 --> 57:31.689
First Duttons
to settle this valley...

57:31.689 --> 57:32.896
fighting was all they knew.

57:32.896 --> 57:34.965
She is not gonna
help you, Dad.

57:34.965 --> 57:38.482
You have invited your worst
enemy to sleep in your bed.

57:38.482 --> 57:40.586
Market Equities
or its partners.

57:40.586 --> 57:42.724
We can do whatever we want.

57:42.724 --> 57:44.034
They want the land, Dad.

57:44.034 --> 57:46.172
That is all that you need
to understand.

57:46.172 --> 57:48.379
Cowards rule the world
these days, Rip.

57:48.379 --> 57:50.275
I think it's time we showed them
what we do and how we do it.
