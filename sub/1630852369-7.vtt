20:02.766 --> 20:07.118

to give our kids a place...

20:07.162 --> 20:09.120
- Mm-hmm.
- That can be theirs, right?

20:09.164 --> 20:11.035

- No, but so, you know,

20:12.820 --> 20:15.039
we had our kids a little later,
and so I won't be here forever.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.127
- Aww.

the other night.</i>

20:20.480 --> 20:22.264

Max and Nicky.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.701
And it was way in the future.
And they were standing there,

20:24.745 --> 20:26.312
and I don't know
what they were looking at,

20:26.355 --> 20:28.270
but one of them
said to the other,

20:28.314 --> 20:31.012
"Oh, Mom would have
loved this."

20:31.055 --> 20:34.276
<i>They could have been watching,</i> <i>
you know, their kids play,</i>

20:34.320 --> 20:37.148
<i>or I don't know.</i> <i>
And I woke up, and I thought,</i>

20:37.192 --> 20:40.630
I have to make sure that they
have places to go to together

20:40.674 --> 20:43.764
so they'll always be connected.

20:43.807 --> 20:46.201
I mean, I was hoping to find
something already built here...

20:46.245 --> 20:47.420
- Mm-hmm.
- That we could just pop into.

20:47.463 --> 20:48.812
Well, maybe you can. Yeah.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.466
Yeah. So we'll see
what happens tomorrow.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.772

at this piece of land

20:51.815 --> 20:53.600

we'll just see what's doing.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.342

the thing for the day.

You can do nothing.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.479

you guys want to do.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.655

Horseback riding.

21:05.699 --> 21:07.178
- I definitely want to do that.
- Okay, great.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.484

Gina's gonna go with me.

21:08.528 --> 21:09.485

ride a horse.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.182
Okay.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.706

a horse than get in the water.

- Oh, my God, it's right there.

21:19.626 --> 21:22.281
- What kind of shark is that?
- It's a hammerhead.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.195
Nobody's ever died
to a hammerhead.

21:24.239 --> 21:26.676
I'm never gonna go

21:26.720 --> 21:29.462
When all is said and done,
to me, riding a horse

21:29.505 --> 21:31.507

than swimming with sharks.

- Did the heat just make it go?
- I think so.

27:49.058 --> 27:51.539
So what time does Noella--is
she supposed to get here later?

27:51.582 --> 27:56.326
I'm a little bit worried
about when Noella comes

27:56.370 --> 27:58.851
the reception that
she's gonna get from Heather.

27:58.894 --> 28:01.331
The reason that Noella
is even on the trip

28:01.375 --> 28:03.507
is because I went
to Heather's house

28:03.551 --> 28:05.858
and literally asked her
for a favor,

28:05.901 --> 28:07.773
a personal favor
to invite Noella.

28:07.816 --> 28:11.385
<i>I am surprised to hear</i> <i>
that Gina had to convince</i>

28:11.428 --> 28:12.995
<i>Heather to invite Noella.</i>

28:13.039 --> 28:16.042
And I think it's good that
she's coming. She should come.

28:16.085 --> 28:20.873
But if there are
such feelings of animosity

28:20.916 --> 28:25.442
between Heather and Noella,
I--yeah, I worry about that.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.270
- So, for right now--
- Does--does Noella know this?

28:27.314 --> 28:28.445
- No.
- No.

28:28.489 --> 28:30.796
I felt like,
if we just got here

28:30.839 --> 28:33.494
and we get them
under the same roof

28:33.537 --> 28:35.583
that they could bond.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.759
- No, I don't see it happening.
- It's hard enough too

28:37.803 --> 28:40.544
that she didn't come with us,
you know.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.895
- She had an appointment.
- I know. I understand.

28:42.938 --> 28:45.593
I'm really hoping
that when Noella comes

28:45.636 --> 28:47.813
that her and Heather
will hit it off.

28:47.856 --> 28:51.512

37:09.139 --> 37:10.228
Noella, cheers.
Cheers.

37:10.271 --> 37:11.533
Welcome.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.709
Oh, yay to warm tequila.
So fun.

37:13.753 --> 37:17.583
- Yeah.
- Perfect timing. Thank you.

37:17.626 --> 37:20.063
That'd be great. Thank you.

37:20.107 --> 37:23.763
I get picky when it comes
to a vintage champagne.

37:23.806 --> 37:26.548
I understand picky
when it comes to the clarity

37:26.592 --> 37:27.941
<i>or color of your diamond.</i>

37:27.984 --> 37:30.117
- I just did--I did half.
- Isn't that good?

37:30.160 --> 37:33.207
- So good.
- It's a tequila shot.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.991
Throw it back. Shut up.

37:38.647 --> 37:41.824
You've got this, like,
gravely sex worker voice

37:41.868 --> 37:43.043
going on right now.

37:43.086 --> 37:46.176
I'm gonna call
1-900-SHANNON later.

37:46.220 --> 37:48.135
And I will give you
a very good time.

37:48.178 --> 37:49.615
See? See?

37:49.658 --> 37:52.139
Hello. This is Shannon.

37:52.182 --> 37:55.969
I'll be talking you
through your phone sex tonight.

37:56.012 --> 37:57.797
I love my Shannon
phone calls.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.626
Like, it's exactly what I need.
You're always checking in

38:00.669 --> 38:02.192
at, like,
the moment where I'm like--

38:02.236 --> 38:04.630
Oh, you're sweet,
but I just feel so horrible

38:04.673 --> 38:06.109
for what you're
going through, sweetie.

38:06.153 --> 38:07.763
I mean, I love that,
because it's, like,

38:07.807 --> 38:10.200
one thing to, like,
go through it. You as well.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.985
And it's like,
"Oh, girl, I got a mugshot.

38:12.028 --> 38:14.248
Oh girl, he started an affair."
And I'm like, you know what?

38:14.292 --> 38:16.903
Life's not that bad.
Life is pretty ----ing good.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.992
"La la la la la,
my life is bad,

38:19.035 --> 38:22.256
but not as bad as yours."
Noella can't read the room.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.998
No. She--Noella's
in the Noella show.

38:25.041 --> 38:29.176
So I'm dying to know
what Nicole said to you

38:29.219 --> 38:30.743
that I said negative
about Gina.

38:30.786 --> 38:33.223
I was shopping
yesterday for Cabo,

38:33.267 --> 38:36.836
and I was shopping with Jen
and with Nicole.

38:36.879 --> 38:38.881
She told me some things
that apparently you had said

38:38.925 --> 38:40.361
about me and Gina.

38:40.405 --> 38:43.190
She said that you said
that all I do is take my kids

38:43.233 --> 38:45.627
to frozen yogurt all the time
and shop at Costco.

38:45.671 --> 38:47.803
I was like, well, I don't know.
I mean.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.677
I was shady. My apologies.
She said, when it came

38:51.720 --> 38:53.287
to Gina--and
I don't like to say this,

38:53.331 --> 38:56.246
'cause it's really--I
don't--you know how--

38:56.290 --> 38:58.597
She said that you said
that Travis was a loser.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.903
And that he was broke,
and he had no money.

39:00.947 --> 39:02.818
That is a bold-faced lie.

39:02.862 --> 39:05.386
I did not say anything
about Travis.

39:05.430 --> 39:10.609
I did actually say something
about Gina's house.

39:10.652 --> 39:11.958
It was months before I met her,

39:12.001 --> 39:13.699
and it was stuff
that I had heard from Bronwyn.

39:13.742 --> 39:15.831
First of all, Nicole
probably said things too.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.093
I can't imagine

39:17.137 --> 39:18.965
that the conversation
was only one-sided.

39:19.008 --> 39:20.575
No, that's what I'm saying.
It's not one-sided.

39:20.619 --> 39:22.142
They both talk sh-- about us.
Fine. Who cares?

39:22.185 --> 39:23.839
<i>Nicole had some</i> <i>
marching orders</i>

39:23.883 --> 39:25.667
to really discredit me
amongst the ladies,

39:25.711 --> 39:27.713
and she was doing
her damnedest to say

39:27.756 --> 39:29.715
<i>and do anything</i> <i>
that would hurt me.</i>

39:32.282 --> 39:33.806
Let me think.

39:33.849 --> 39:34.937
Hmm.

39:36.635 --> 39:39.072
Heather. Duh.

39:39.115 --> 39:43.206
I can't freaking believe that.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.991
But I really just
genuinely feel like you

39:45.034 --> 39:47.210
need to have fun
on vacation right now.

39:47.254 --> 39:48.647
Listen,
it's been two minutes.

39:48.690 --> 39:49.952
Can I process
that new information?

39:49.996 --> 39:51.345
Can I get two minutes
to process that?

39:51.389 --> 39:53.129
- It's a lot for me.
- That's a lot.

39:53.173 --> 39:55.305
This was, like, a girl who was
on my favorites list, until--

39:55.349 --> 39:56.872
You didn't eat
any of your dinner.

39:56.916 --> 39:58.396
Can you stop food
shaming me, okay?

39:58.439 --> 40:00.136
You know what?
I got a pile of anxiety

40:00.180 --> 40:03.052
and a sh-- of a life right now.
It looks amazing.

40:03.096 --> 40:04.750
You know what? I'm gonna
eat the freaking potatoes.

40:04.793 --> 40:06.099
Everyone want to watch me?

40:06.142 --> 40:07.666
- Okay, wait, wait.
- I'm eating the potato.

40:07.709 --> 40:10.190
- No, but--
- If I can get it in my mouth.

40:10.233 --> 40:12.845
If I can get it in my...

40:12.888 --> 40:14.673
Okay, if you're not gonna
eat, just, like,

40:14.716 --> 40:17.197
be, like, low-key about it.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.851
I'm gonna go with you.

40:18.894 --> 40:21.897
<i>I'm just trying to manage</i> <i>
the dynamic right now,</i>

40:21.941 --> 40:23.943
and it's becoming unmanageable.

40:23.986 --> 40:26.336
I feel weird, because
there's a lot of talk

40:26.380 --> 40:28.817
about things that Nicole said.

40:28.861 --> 40:32.778
It appears as though the two of
them aired their dirty laundry,

40:32.821 --> 40:34.301
and now they're both kind of

40:34.344 --> 40:36.129
holding things that they

40:36.172 --> 40:37.870
Well, that's nice.
I don't like that.

40:37.913 --> 40:39.480
Yeah, but okay, the thing
about the dinner,

40:39.524 --> 40:40.786
like, when we just--
when you ordered the dinner,

40:40.829 --> 40:42.178
and then I said
you should eat the dinner,

40:42.222 --> 40:43.441
'cause you ordered it...
- Yeah.

40:43.484 --> 40:44.746
And then you made
a big deal about it--

40:44.790 --> 40:46.226
It wasn't--it was--I was--

40:46.269 --> 40:48.663
No, but Heather--I think
Heather was annoyed by that.

40:48.707 --> 40:51.492
Are you telling me that
because I didn't eat

40:51.536 --> 40:54.930
the octopus
that I have offended our host?

40:54.974 --> 40:58.151
I don't need anyone
to tell me how to behave.

40:58.194 --> 41:02.808
Clearly Gina and Emily
have drunk the Kool-Aid,

41:02.851 --> 41:03.896
<i>Heather's Kool-Aid.</i>

41:03.939 --> 41:05.071
You should look into her eyes.

41:05.114 --> 41:06.551
She's offended
by everything that I say.

41:06.594 --> 41:09.075
So, don't fight that battle.
These are not the girls

41:09.118 --> 41:10.903
that I just hung out
with in Orange County.

41:10.946 --> 41:14.036
There's something going on.
I don't care. Is that okay

41:14.080 --> 41:16.822
that I don't care
whether Heather Dubrow cares

41:16.865 --> 41:18.040
whether I finish
my meal or not?

41:18.084 --> 41:19.912
Is that okay?
Am I safe to say that?

41:19.955 --> 41:21.348
I don't even want
to talk about it.

41:21.391 --> 41:23.002
Like, we're supposed
to be here having fun,

41:23.045 --> 41:25.134
and this is exactly
the reason why, you know,

41:25.178 --> 41:27.833
when Gina said invite Noella,
I was like, I'm just worried,

41:27.876 --> 41:29.269
because I don't want
to do this.

41:29.312 --> 41:30.357
And I still don't want
to do this.
