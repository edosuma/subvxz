00:03.670 --> 00:06.298
- So, is it me, or is it
becoming easier for you to look?

00:06.340 --> 00:09.059
- I can make myself look, but
the thinking is shutting down.

00:09.110 --> 00:12.602
- The way that I am isn't
compatible with the way that--

00:12.640 --> 00:13.709
- The way I am.

00:13.740 --> 00:16.743
- Do you know where you are,
Mr. Gﬁiham?
- o.

00:16.780 --> 00:19.749
- My sister was impaled
on a severed stag head,

00:19.780 --> 00:21.338
cut down the middle.

00:21.380 --> 00:23.189
- I can help you.
We can hide the body.

00:23.220 --> 00:26.587
- Abigail Hobbs may be the only
person who knows the truth.

00:26.620 --> 00:29.418
- You can't ask her right now,
Jack.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.519
- I want to go home.

00:59.490 --> 01:02.288
(camera click)

01:05.390 --> 01:07.358
- World's sickest jigsaw puzzle.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.766
- Yeah, but where are
the corners?

01:09.800 --> 01:10.892
- What?

01:10.930 --> 01:15.264
- My mom always said,
start a jigsaw with the corners.

01:15.300 --> 01:18.360
- Uh, the heads are the corners,
I guess?

01:18.410 --> 01:20.378
- We've got too many corners.

01:20.410 --> 01:23.573
Seven graves.
Way too many heads.

01:29.620 --> 01:32.680
- The headpiece appears
to be the only recent victim.

01:32.720 --> 01:36.486
The others are years,
even decades, old.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.282
And we know that seven

01:38.330 --> 01:40.753
of the bodies were buried
out here.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.691
- Whoever dug them up knew
exactly where they were buried.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.698
- I guess it wasn't enough
for him to kill them once;

01:46.740 --> 01:49.436
he had to come back
and defile his victims.

01:49.470 --> 01:51.506
- These graves weren't
desecrated, Jack;

01:51.540 --> 01:53.633
they were exposed.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.581
- OK, everybody, let's go,
let's clear the scene!

02:35.380 --> 02:39.658
(soft ambient pulse)

02:57.940 --> 03:00.579
- I planned this moment,

03:00.610 --> 03:03.807
this monument, with precision.

03:06.550 --> 03:09.940
Collected all my raw materials
in advance.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.299
I position the bodies carefully,

03:19.330 --> 03:22.925
according each
its rightful place.

03:25.430 --> 03:30.709
Peace in the pieces
disassembled.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.479
My latest victim

03:37.510 --> 03:41.014
I save for last.

03:41.050 --> 03:43.416
I want him to watch me work.

03:43.450 --> 03:47.716
I want him to know my design.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.629
This is my rsum.

05:11.670 --> 05:16.744
This is my body of work. This is
my legacy.

05:34.830 --> 05:37.719
- Will. I wasn't
expecting you.

05:39.570 --> 05:40.889
- I don't know how I got here.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.101
- Your car is outside,
so we know you drove.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.802
- Well, I was on a beach
in Grafton, West Virginia.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.535
I blinked, and then H was

05:47.580 --> 05:49.775
waking up in your waiting room,
except I wasn't asleep!

05:49.810 --> 05:53.541
- Grafton, West Virginia, is
three-and-a-half hours from
here. You lost time.

05:53.580 --> 05:57.141
- Th-There is
something wrong with me.
- You're disassociating, Will.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.409
It's a desperate survival
mechanism for a psyche that
endures repeated abuse.

06:00.460 --> 06:03.088
- No, no, I'm not abused!
- You have an empathy disorder.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.724
What you feel is
overwhelming you.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.751
Yet you choose to ignore it.
That's the abuse

06:07.800 --> 06:09.825
I'm referring to.
- What, do you want me to quit?

06:09.870 --> 06:13.499
- Well, Jack Crawford gave you
a chance to quit, and you
didn't take it. Why?

06:13.540 --> 06:15.667
- Um...

06:15.700 --> 06:17.509
I save lives.

06:17.540 --> 06:20.429
- And that feels good.
- Generally speaking, yeah.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.608
- What about your life?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.447
I'm your friend, Will.
I don't care

06:25.480 --> 06:27.778
about the lives you save;
I care about your life,

06:27.820 --> 06:30.414
and your life is separating
from reality.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.395
- I've been sleepwalking.

06:45.830 --> 06:48.390
I'm experiencing hallucinations.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.775
Maybe I should get a brain scan.
- Will.

06:54.810 --> 06:58.678
Stop looking in the wrong corner
for an answer to this.

07:00.850 --> 07:02.818
YOU were at the crime scene

07:02.850 --> 07:06.183
when you disassociated.
Tell me about it.

07:06.220 --> 07:09.155
- It was a totem pole of bodies.

07:10.990 --> 07:13.493
- In some cultures, crimes
and guilt are made manifest

07:13.530 --> 07:15.657
so that everyone can see them
and see their shame.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.065
- No, this isn't shame;

07:17.100 --> 07:20.831
this is celebration.
He's marking his achievements.

07:20.870 --> 07:23.168
- And faced
with this killer's achievements,

07:23.210 --> 07:26.168
your mind needed to escape,
and you lost time.

07:26.210 --> 07:28.804
- Yes.

07:32.950 --> 07:34.918
- I'm worried about you, Will.

07:34.950 --> 07:37.919
You empathize so completely
with the killers Jack Crawford

07:37.950 --> 07:41.750
has your mind wrapped around
that you lose yourself to them.

07:41.790 --> 07:44.486
What if you lose time
and hurt yourself?

07:44.530 --> 07:46.691
Or someone else?

07:49.700 --> 07:53.864
I don't want you to wake up and
see a totem of your own making.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.701
***

08:21.660 --> 08:25.096
- Every day I wake up and...

08:25.130 --> 08:27.496
I hear my dad's voice.

08:30.670 --> 08:33.036
Like he was kneeling
next to my bed.

08:36.780 --> 08:39.749
He whispers what he told me.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.753
He told me he killed girls.

08:49.590 --> 08:52.593
Again and again.

08:52.630 --> 08:56.623
So he wouldn't have to kill me.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.096
I wish he was still alive

09:02.140 --> 09:05.007
so I could ask him...

09:05.040 --> 09:07.008
what did I make him feel?

09:07.040 --> 09:09.838
What was so wrong with me

09:09.880 --> 09:12.348
that he wanted to kill--
- He should have.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.974
He should have killed you.

09:17.220 --> 09:20.849
So he wouldn't have killed me.
- So he wouldn't have killed me.

09:20.890 --> 09:24.018
- So he wouldn't have killed me.
- So he wouldn't have killed me.

09:24.060 --> 09:26.995
- (girls): So he wouldn't have
killed me.

09:27.030 --> 09:30.295
(girls' voices echoing)

09:30.330 --> 09:33.595
- So he wouldn't have killed me.
- So he wouldn't have killed me.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.232
(girls' voices echoing)

09:35.270 --> 09:39.730
(Abigail breathing rapidly)
- He should have killed you.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.143
So that you wouldn't have
killed me.

09:44.180 --> 09:46.842
(gasping and panting)

10:02.330 --> 10:03.991
- Hey.

10:10.370 --> 10:12.338
- I'm sorry about yesterday.

10:12.370 --> 10:14.804
- Sorry about what?

10:16.440 --> 10:20.217
- I... I wasn't feeling
like myself.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.411
- Well, not feeling
like yourself,

10:22.450 --> 10:24.748
that's kind of what you do,
isn't it?

10:24.790 --> 10:27.054
- I suppose so.
(both chuckling)

10:27.090 --> 10:29.411
- Yeah. OK.

10:29.460 --> 10:32.156
- So, I seemed fine to you?

10:32.190 --> 10:36.024
- Is there something you want
to tell me?

10:36.060 --> 10:38.324
- Uh, no. No, no.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.793
- Well, clearly

10:40.840 --> 10:43.161
there's something
that you don't want to tell me.

10:43.210 --> 10:47.931
- I-I guess I just got
a little lost yesterday, is all.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.676
- And where are you today?

10:54.720 --> 10:59.009
- It got to me.
(chuckling)

10:59.050 --> 11:02.213
All those bodies got to me,
and, uh,

11:02.260 --> 11:06.287
I thought it was a little more
obvious than... than it was.

11:06.330 --> 11:11.393
(deep sigh)

11:11.430 --> 11:14.968
- If there's a problem,
you need to tell me.

11:19.340 --> 11:21.831
Is there a problem, Will?

11:21.880 --> 11:25.668
- Everything's ﬁne.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.242
- All right.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.986
- All right.

11:46.370 --> 11:49.259
- They sold my parents' house.

11:49.300 --> 11:53.270
Murder houses don't fetch
big money In today's
real estate market.

11:53.310 --> 11:55.369
- Not that you'll get any of it.

11:55.410 --> 11:59.949
The families of your father's
victims filed wrongful death
suits.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.017
- Wrongful death?
- That means that they get

12:03.050 --> 12:05.780
everything, Abigail.
Every penny.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.428
What you have

12:10.460 --> 12:13.156
here is all you have.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.199
- Let them take
all his money.

12:18.230 --> 12:20.460
I don't want any of it.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.468
- You can make your own money.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.400
- How much would I get

12:24.440 --> 12:28.171
if you wrote a book
about me?

12:28.210 --> 12:30.246
About my dad?

12:30.280 --> 12:32.407
- Plenty.

12:32.450 --> 12:35.840
- Do you still want
to tell my story?

12:35.880 --> 12:38.940
- I think you need
to tell your own story,

12:38.990 --> 12:41.379
but I am the one
to help you tell it.

12:41.420 --> 12:44.981
No one knows more about
what your father did than I do.

12:45.030 --> 12:48.329
- Not even Will Graham?
- Will Graham is

12:48.360 --> 12:52.865
part of the story you tell,
Abigail, not the person
to help you tell it.

12:52.900 --> 12:57.303
- He avoids me because
I make him feel like my father.

12:57.340 --> 13:00.571
- Feeling like your father
makes him feel like a killer.

13:00.610 --> 13:04.239
- People thinkI helped my dad
kill those girls.

13:04.280 --> 13:07.818
- Well, you can change
what people think.

13:07.850 --> 13:10.080
We can change that together.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.987
Everyone will know the truth.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.221
- OK.

13:19.260 --> 13:21.251
Let's tell my story.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.617
- How many bodies?

13:44.650 --> 13:46.618
- (Brian): We got 17 in total.

13:46.650 --> 13:49.483
- Meet our freshest one,

13:49.520 --> 13:51.385
Joel Summers.

13:51.430 --> 13:52.920
Forty years old,

13:52.960 --> 13:54.996
runs a cell phone store
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

13:55.030 --> 13:57.123
Or did. Been missing
for three days.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.161
- Single stab wound
to the heart.

13:59.200 --> 14:03.466
Other injuries were
post mortem--broken bones,
dislocated hips, shoulders.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.934
- He was special to him somehow.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.574
He held a place of honor.
- Seven bodies

14:09.610 --> 14:12.078
from unmarked graves found
at the crime scene.

14:12.110 --> 14:15.170
Earth from the body parts
matches the gravesites.

14:15.220 --> 14:18.280
- Blunt force trauma, stabbings,
strangulations. Wrongful deaths.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.288
- There are
at least eight other bodies

14:20.320 --> 14:23.084
that are recent grave robbings
from all across West Virginia.

14:23.130 --> 14:26.622
No crimes attributed to any
of them. Accidental deaths.

14:26.660 --> 14:29.493
- They're all murders.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.434
- Anthony Lamb, 28,

14:40.480 --> 14:43.347
fatal car wreck, 1986.

14:43.380 --> 14:45.177
Francesca Bourdain, 42,

14:45.210 --> 14:47.542
suicide, pills, 1994.

14:47.580 --> 14:49.548
Adrian Packham, 60,

14:49.580 --> 14:52.242
massive coronary, 2001.

14:52.290 --> 14:54.087
Peter McGee, 25,

14:54.120 --> 14:57.180
carbon monoxide poisoning
in his home, 2006.

14:57.230 --> 15:03.169
And seven as-yet unidentified
bodies buried on a beach.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.168
Every death is different,

15:05.200 --> 15:08.465
made to look
like something else.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.298
No sadism, no torture.

15:11.340 --> 15:15.572
The method of these murders was
less important to the killer

15:15.610 --> 15:18.204
than the simple fact...

15:18.250 --> 15:20.411
that these people die.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.519
Joel Summers,

15:25.550 --> 15:30.158
killed with a single stab
to the heart.

15:30.190 --> 15:34.229
presented with great ostentation

15:34.260 --> 15:37.696
atop a display
of all the previous victims.

15:37.730 --> 15:43.202
This killer's design was
to remain unnoticed, a ghost.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.401
That is what excited him.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.537
Until now.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.548
Why...

15:51.580 --> 15:54.413
is he coming out into the light?

15:54.450 --> 15:56.441
- Will?

15:56.480 --> 15:59.984
I don't want to interrupt
if you're rehearsing, or...

16:03.790 --> 16:08.352
- Uh... n...no, no, no.
It's OK, it's OK.

16:11.630 --> 16:14.531
- Very moody in here.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.437
- Uh... well, that's me
all over.

16:19.470 --> 16:22.109
(He chuckles.)
Come on in.

16:24.510 --> 16:27.013
I promise I won't try
to kiss you again.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.685
Unless you've stopped taking
your own advice.

16:31.720 --> 16:37.556
- A doctor who treats herself
has a fool for a patient.

16:39.430 --> 16:43.127
I regretted leaving your house
the other night.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.798
- Regretted?

16:45.830 --> 16:48.390
(slide clicker dropped on table)

16:48.440 --> 16:51.534
Implying that you're
no longer regretting,

16:51.570 --> 16:54.539
or are you still
in a state of regret?

16:54.580 --> 16:58.209
- I'm crisscrossing
the state line.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.309
- What side of the line
you on now?

17:01.820 --> 17:05.517
- I've got one foot
firmly planted on both sides.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.424
- Are you telling me that
to confuse me?

17:13.460 --> 17:17.362
- No, I'm telling you that
to be honest about how I feel.

17:17.400 --> 17:21.336
I don't want to mislead you,
but I don't want to lie
to you eIther.

17:21.370 --> 17:24.533
- I won't lie if you don't.

17:27.780 --> 17:31.147
- I have feelings for you, Will.

17:33.420 --> 17:37.845
But I can't just have an affair
with you.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.108
It would be...

17:40.160 --> 17:42.685
reckless.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.221
- Why?

17:44.260 --> 17:46.228
(chuckling): Why?

17:46.260 --> 17:49.127
And it is not because you have
a professional curiosity

17:49.160 --> 17:51.799
about me.
- No.

17:51.830 --> 17:55.368
It's because I think
you're unstable.

17:58.710 --> 18:02.669
And until that changes,
I can only be your friend.

18:05.780 --> 18:08.112
- Thank you for not lying.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.111
- Do you feel unstable?

18:17.560 --> 18:19.255
- Mm.

18:40.550 --> 18:43.644
I'm trying
to be understated

18:43.690 --> 18:47.251
when I say that this is
a bad idea.

18:47.290 --> 18:48.655
- Freddie Lounds is dangerous.

18:48.690 --> 18:51.250
- She said she wanted me
to write about you guys

18:51.290 --> 18:53.349
in the book.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.392
- You would be forfeiting
your privacy and ours.

18:58.430 --> 19:02.366
- This... this... well,
all of this will change.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.938
Whatever you're feeling now,
that won't last.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.404
Things change.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.341
Things are changing for me too.

19:12.980 --> 19:14.675
I'm doing some accounting

19:14.720 --> 19:17.314
of what's important in my life
and what isn't.

19:17.350 --> 19:20.808
You are important, Abigail.

19:20.860 --> 19:26.184
- Just because you killed my dad
doesn't mean you get to be him.

19:26.230 --> 19:28.698
- Abigail, we've been through

19:28.730 --> 19:31.699
a traumatic event, and no one
more traumatized

19:31.730 --> 19:34.665
than you, Abigail, but we went
through it together.

19:34.700 --> 19:36.839
What you write, you write
about all of us.

19:36.870 --> 19:38.838
- I don't need
your permussnon.

19:38.870 --> 19:43.546
- And you don't need
our approval, but I hope
it would mean something.

19:45.750 --> 19:48.469
- I know what people think
I did.

19:50.350 --> 19:51.715
They're wrong.

19:51.750 --> 19:55.311
Why can't I tell everybody
that they're wrong?

19:55.360 --> 19:58.682
- You have nothing
to apologize for.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.322
- Yet.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.999
But if you open
this door, Abigail,

20:03.030 --> 20:05.521
you won't control
what comes through.

20:05.570 --> 20:08.368
Are you ready for that?

20:34.560 --> 20:37.927
- The display was built
in Grafton for a reason.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.029
Totem poles commemorate
special events.

20:40.070 --> 20:42.368
They tell the story
of a life.

20:42.400 --> 20:46.461
If Joel Summers is his finale,
then this lowest body

20:46.510 --> 20:48.671
on the pole will be
our killer's beginning.

20:48.710 --> 20:50.701
His first.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.399
- Fletcher Marshall.

20:52.450 --> 20:55.419
Murdered in 1973. Beaten
to death right in Grafton.

20:55.450 --> 20:57.418
His grave was robbed
five days ago.

20:57.450 --> 21:02.285
- No one convicted
of killing him?
- Not yet.

21:02.320 --> 21:05.426
- So our guy got away with it
40 years ago.

21:05.460 --> 21:08.293
- So he kept on going.

21:08.330 --> 21:10.662
- There will be
a connection between

21:10.700 --> 21:11.962
Joel Summers

21:12.000 --> 21:13.695
and Fletcher Marshall.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.492
- Will.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.861
I need you in my office.

21:24.480 --> 21:28.018
Nicholas Boyle turned up
in Minnesota--dead.

21:28.050 --> 21:30.780
His body was found in the woods.
He was frozen.

21:30.820 --> 21:33.311
They thawed him out
fairly quickly, but they said

21:33.360 --> 21:35.316
they can't tell if he died
a week ago,

21:35.360 --> 21:37.487
six weeks ago, or the night
that he disappeared.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.020
- (Alana): How did he die?

21:41.760 --> 21:47.437
- Knife wound. He was gutted.
I've had the body flown down
here. I want Abigail Hobbs

21:47.470 --> 21:49.028
to identify it for us.

21:49.070 --> 21:51.334
- You already have
a positive ID.

21:51.370 --> 21:53.577
- Not from Abigail Hobbs.
- You can't put her in a room

21:53.610 --> 21:56.033
with Nick Boyle's body.
She already has nightmares

21:56.080 --> 21:58.640
about him, Jack.
- I'm curious about why.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.979
- You can't think that she has
something to do with this?
- I think Abigail

22:02.020 --> 22:05.786
Hobbs is the common denominator
between her father,
Marissa Schuur,

22:05.820 --> 22:08.550
and Nicholas Boyle.
They all go back to Abigail.

22:08.590 --> 22:11.024
My instincts tell me
that Abigail has answers

22:11.060 --> 22:13.790
that we have not heard.
- What are the questions, Jack?

22:13.830 --> 22:15.627
- Let's start with
where she goes

22:15.660 --> 22:18.094
when she climbs the walls
of the psychiatric facility.

22:18.130 --> 22:21.099
Maybe she's meeting
Nicholas Boyle. None of us know

22:21.140 --> 22:23.506
what was really going on
between them.

22:23.540 --> 22:25.508
- I want to go on record
as saying that this is

22:25.540 --> 22:29.135
a very bad idea. Hannibal?
- Jack has the look of a man

22:29.180 --> 22:31.375
with no interest in any opinion
but his own.

22:31.410 --> 22:34.641
- I want you to observe
on this, Alana.

22:34.680 --> 22:38.047
- If you're putting Abigail
in a room with the body,
I want to be there.

22:38.090 --> 22:41.059
- I'm sorry, Will. I am not
very confident with your ability

22:41.090 --> 22:45.424
to be objective about
Abigail Hobbs right now. Alana.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.659
- He could do Abigail
irreparable damage

22:56.700 --> 22:58.531
exposing her to this.

22:58.570 --> 23:01.107
- Perhaps she's stronger
than we think.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.485
- Miss Hobbs, I want you to look

23:18.530 --> 23:20.418
at this man.

23:22.060 --> 23:25.029
Is this the same person
that attacked you,

23:25.070 --> 23:27.834
Dr. Bloom, and Dr. Lecter
at your home?

23:27.870 --> 23:31.101
- That's him.

23:31.140 --> 23:32.835
- Good.

23:32.870 --> 23:36.476
I just have a few other
questions I'd like you
to answer.

23:38.710 --> 23:42.009
Have you seen this man
since the night he attacked you?

23:42.050 --> 23:44.917
- Could you cover him up?

23:44.950 --> 23:47.214
- I just need you to answer
the question first.

23:47.250 --> 23:49.514
Please.

23:53.730 --> 23:55.698
- No.

23:55.730 --> 23:57.721
I haven't seen him

23:57.770 --> 24:00.591
since h-he attacked me.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.938
- This man, Nicholas Boyle,

24:02.970 --> 24:05.837
was gutted with a hunting knife.

24:05.870 --> 24:07.735
You knew how to do that.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.568
Your father taught you.
- Jack, I won't be
party to this.

24:11.610 --> 24:13.202
- Then you can leave.

24:13.250 --> 24:15.468
You're here by invitation,
by courtesy, Dr. Bloom.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.011
Please don't interrupt me again.

24:19.990 --> 24:22.686
- You think I did this?

24:22.720 --> 24:24.483
- Where do you go

24:24.530 --> 24:27.658
when you escape
from the hospital, Abigail?

24:29.230 --> 24:32.563
_ - Sometimes..._
into the City, sometimes

24:32.600 --> 24:34.636
into the woods,

24:34.670 --> 24:37.503
sometimes just out.

24:37.540 --> 24:43.228
I go get away from... this,

24:43.280 --> 24:46.670
to be alone
where I can...

24:46.710 --> 24:50.009
think... breathe.

24:50.050 --> 24:52.018
- Did you ever meet
with Nicholas Boyle

24:52.050 --> 24:54.757
on one of your little getaways
from the hospital?

24:57.020 --> 25:00.148
Did the two of you
know each other before
the night he attacked you?

25:00.190 --> 25:02.829
Did he know your father--

25:02.860 --> 25:04.669
- No.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.694
- And you know nothing
about his death?

25:12.340 --> 25:15.571
- I know he tried to kill me.

25:17.040 --> 25:20.578
And when he was trying to kill
me, all I could think was

25:20.620 --> 25:23.589
that I was gonna die
in that house after all.

25:27.590 --> 25:29.148
But I didn't.

25:30.990 --> 25:32.821
I survived.

25:32.860 --> 25:36.956
Dr. Bloom and...

25:37.000 --> 25:39.719
Dr. Lecter saved my life.

25:39.770 --> 25:41.761
They saved me from him.

25:47.610 --> 25:50.738
- And you haven't seen him
since?

25:50.780 --> 25:53.044
- Only in my nightmares.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.743
- You believe her?
- I think

26:24.780 --> 26:26.839
Abigail Hobbs is damaged.
There is something

26:26.880 --> 26:29.769
she's using every ounce
of that strength to keep buried,

26:29.820 --> 26:31.811
but it's not the murder
of Nicholas Boyle, Jack!

26:31.850 --> 26:34.159
- What makes you so sure?
- Because any reservations

26:34.190 --> 26:37.057
I have about Abigail don't
extend to Hannibal!

26:39.330 --> 26:42.652
He has no reason to lie
about any of this!

26:59.080 --> 27:02.743
- It can be a comfort to see
the broken, bloated corpse
of a monster

27:02.780 --> 27:05.817
and know it can
never come back.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.784
- Nick Boyle wasn't a monster.

27:14.030 --> 27:15.759
- Were you?

27:17.400 --> 27:20.221
- I sometimes feel like one.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.209
- Is that why
you uncovered his body?

27:27.340 --> 27:30.332
Would this be a chapter
in your book, Abigail?

27:30.380 --> 27:34.419
- No. Neither would killing Nick
or you helping me hide the body.

27:34.450 --> 27:36.941
- There's always an addendum.

27:36.980 --> 27:40.381
- The FBI already asked their
questions. I answered them.
I passed.

27:40.420 --> 27:42.684
- With Jack Crawford's
attention.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.688
- You're right.
I opened the door.

27:44.730 --> 27:47.358
I can't control what comes
through it, but this time

27:47.390 --> 27:50.791
I could control when.

27:50.830 --> 27:53.469
I'm not afraid of them
finding Nicholas Boyle anymore.

27:53.500 --> 27:56.162
He's been found.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.304
- You betrayed my trust.

27:58.340 --> 28:01.309
You jeopardized my life
as well as your own.

28:01.340 --> 28:04.173
I deserve more than that.

28:06.350 --> 28:10.116
I need to trust you,
Abigail.

28:10.150 --> 28:12.289
What if I can't?

28:16.490 --> 28:18.924
- Joel Summers, the headpiece
of our totem pole, was adopted

28:18.960 --> 28:21.428
after his parents died.
Guess who dad was.

28:21.460 --> 28:22.950
- Fletcher Marshall.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.491
Joel Summers is
Joe! Marshall.

28:25.530 --> 28:30.069
- Uh, we did a DNA comparison
between Fletcher Marshall
and Joel Summers.

28:30.100 --> 28:31.965
No match.

28:32.010 --> 28:35.070
- So Marshall's son wasn't
his son?

28:35.110 --> 28:38.045
- The mom, Eleanor, was killed
in a car accident four years

28:38.080 --> 28:40.344
after Fletcher was killed.
- Genuine car accident?

28:40.380 --> 28:42.348
- If she was murdered, she would
have been on the totem pole.

28:42.380 --> 28:45.383
- Well, unless he loved her too
much to disgrace her that way.

28:45.420 --> 28:48.014
- Was anyone ever convicted
for Marshall's murder?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.459
- There was a man
named Laurence Wells

28:49.490 --> 28:54.291
who was questioned twice
in 1973. Never charged.
Still lives in Grafton.

28:56.130 --> 28:58.428
- Fletcher Marshall was a crime
of passmn.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.496
It had something that none
of the other murders had.

29:01.540 --> 29:04.862
- Motive.

29:09.510 --> 29:12.172
- (man): It's open. Come in.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.089
I'm unarmed.

29:21.420 --> 29:24.389
- So you were expecting us.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.797
- I had faith you'd find me.

29:27.830 --> 29:29.354
- And why is that, Mr. Wells?

29:29.400 --> 29:31.425
- Because I let you.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.337
That last one was...

29:34.370 --> 29:38.238
let's just say it's a good thing
it was the last one.

29:38.270 --> 29:41.137
I don't have the fight
in me anymore.

29:41.180 --> 29:44.206
- Are you confessing
to the murder of Joel Summers?

29:44.250 --> 29:46.502
(He chuckles.)

29:46.550 --> 29:49.849
- And Fletcher Marshall.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.883
And 15 others.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.512
I assume you've counted 'em up

29:54.560 --> 29:58.280
by now.
- So you killed Joel Summers
just so you'd be caught.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.924
- Not just.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.928
I killed Joel Summers

30:02.960 --> 30:06.191
because he was never meant
to be.

30:06.230 --> 30:08.960
- What reason did you have
to kill the others?

30:09.000 --> 30:11.867
- I had every reason
to kill the others.

30:11.910 --> 30:14.003
They just had no reason to die.

30:15.480 --> 30:20.076
They never saw me coming unless
I wanted them to see me coming.

30:23.080 --> 30:26.880
I could wave at a lady
and smile,

30:26.920 --> 30:29.912
chew the fat with her in church,

30:29.960 --> 30:32.155
knowing I killed her husband.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.059
There is something beautiful

30:36.100 --> 30:38.625
about that ball of silence
at a funeral,

30:38.670 --> 30:40.934
all those people around you,

30:40.970 --> 30:43.336
knowing that you made it happen.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.034
- Now there's something
beautiful about knowing

30:48.080 --> 30:50.947
that you'll spend the rest
of your life in prison.

30:50.980 --> 30:54.871
- Do I look wealthy to you?

30:54.920 --> 30:57.218
Prison is gonna be a luxury

30:57.250 --> 31:00.344
next to the kind
of retirement home I can afford.

31:00.390 --> 31:05.350
And I certainly won't be
forgotten there.

31:05.390 --> 31:09.520
I'm securing my...

31:09.560 --> 31:11.960
I'm securing my legacy.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.662
- That's one way
to be remembered.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.237
No children to tell your story.

31:17.270 --> 31:19.363
Did Joel Summers remember
his father?

31:19.410 --> 31:21.401
- Not anymore.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.237
- Did you have an affair

31:23.280 --> 31:25.942
with Eleanor Marshall
before you murdered her?

31:28.450 --> 31:30.941
From your silence, I'm gonna
take that as a yes.

31:30.990 --> 31:35.279
- He was your son. Joel Summers.
- What?

31:35.320 --> 31:37.288
- You thought the woman
you loved was having

31:37.320 --> 31:39.356
Fletcher Marshall's baby when
she should've been having yours,

31:39.390 --> 31:41.529
but you got it
the wrong way around.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.289
Eleanor chose to raise him

31:43.330 --> 31:46.458
as Fletcher Marshall's child
rather than yours,

31:46.500 --> 31:48.968
so maybe...

31:49.000 --> 31:51.161
she saw what's in your heart.

31:51.210 --> 31:56.409
- You didn't secure your legacy,
Mr. Wells; you murdered it.

31:59.010 --> 32:01.171
to destroy your son.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.391
- Killing somebody,

32:18.430 --> 32:20.421
it feels that bad?

32:23.270 --> 32:25.329
I'm worried about nightmares.

32:25.370 --> 32:29.079
- (Hannibal): We'll help you
with the nightmares.

32:44.590 --> 32:46.558
(soft ambient pulse)

32:46.590 --> 32:48.956
(heartbeat)

33:02.780 --> 33:05.271
(Nick groaning)

33:15.820 --> 33:18.254
(She gasps.)

33:37.310 --> 33:41.474
(Cello Suite No.2: "Sarabande"
by Bach playing)

33:56.330 --> 33:59.265
- Abigail Hobbs killed
Nick Boyle.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.365
- Yes, I know.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.377
- Tell me why you know.

34:09.410 --> 34:13.346
- I helped her dispose
of the body.

34:17.250 --> 34:19.548
- Evidently...

34:19.590 --> 34:23.356
not well enough.

34:23.390 --> 34:25.654
- Have you told
Jack Crawford?

34:25.690 --> 34:28.397
- No.

34:28.430 --> 34:29.795
- Why not?

34:29.830 --> 34:32.663
- Because I was hoping
it wasn't true.

34:40.510 --> 34:44.378
- Well... now you know
the truth.

34:44.410 --> 34:45.638
-Do I?

34:45.680 --> 34:50.117
- Everything you know about that
night is true, except the end.

34:50.150 --> 34:52.289
Nicholas Boyle attacked us.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.413
Abigail's only crime was
to defend herself,

34:54.460 --> 34:56.587
and I lied about it.
- Why?

34:56.620 --> 34:59.259
- You know why.

34:59.290 --> 35:01.451
Because Jack Crawford would
hang her

35:01.500 --> 35:04.219
for what her father's done,
and the world would burn Abigail

35:04.270 --> 35:06.465
in his place.
That would be the story.

35:06.500 --> 35:09.333
That would be
what Freddie Lounds writes.

35:13.270 --> 35:14.874
Abigail is no more a killer
than you are

35:14.910 --> 35:17.674
for shooting her father, or I am
for the death of Tobias Budge.

35:17.710 --> 35:21.669
- It isn't our place to decide.
- If not ours, then whose?

35:21.720 --> 35:24.746
Who knows Abigail
better than you and I?

35:24.790 --> 35:27.486
Or the burden she bears?

35:29.720 --> 35:31.620
We are her fathers now.

35:31.660 --> 35:35.198
We have to serve her
better than Garret Jacob Hobbs.

35:44.810 --> 35:48.405
If you go to Jack, then
you murder Abigail's future.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.740
Do I need to call my lawyer,
Will?

36:20.840 --> 36:23.206
We can tell no one.

36:33.820 --> 36:36.653
What we are doing here is
the right thing.

36:40.590 --> 36:44.469
In time, this will be the only
story any of us cares to tell.

36:57.740 --> 37:03.519
(classical music playing)
I feel terrible, Miss Lounds.

37:03.550 --> 37:07.316
Never entered my head
you might be a vegetarian.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.489
A lapse on my behalf.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.683
- Research always delivers
benefits.

37:12.730 --> 37:16.427
- If it contradicts a good
story, hell, publish it anyway.

37:17.900 --> 37:19.868
- Are you still angry
I called you insane?

37:19.900 --> 37:22.733
The libel laws are clear,
Mr. Graham.

37:22.770 --> 37:24.863
- (Will): Insinuation is
such a grey area.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.629
- Insane isn't really black
or white, is it?

37:27.670 --> 37:30.002
We're all pathological
in our own ways.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.703
- You choose the version
of the truth that suits you best

37:33.750 --> 37:35.775
and pursue it pathologically.

37:35.820 --> 37:38.618
- Everybody decides
their own versions of the truth.

37:38.650 --> 37:42.780
I'm here because I want to tell
Abigail's version of the truth.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.829
- See that you do.

37:46.860 --> 37:49.624
- I don't have anything
to hide.

37:49.660 --> 37:51.628
- Everyone has something
to hide,

37:51.670 --> 37:54.559
but I won't tell anything
you don't want me to.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.034
- You must understand
our concerns.

37:57.070 --> 37:59.538
We care about Abigail.

37:59.570 --> 38:01.902
Our only thought is
to protect her.

38:01.940 --> 38:05.307
- Hm. She's already exposed.

38:05.350 --> 38:07.079
Her silence until now has

38:07.110 --> 38:09.908
been taken as guilt.
This book is

38:09.950 --> 38:11.781
about her innocence.

38:11.820 --> 38:14.380
I want Abigail
to have a future.

38:14.420 --> 38:16.513
- That's what we all want.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.882
- Well, we all want
what's best for Abigail.

38:21.930 --> 38:25.593
- This is possibly
the finest salad I've
ever eaten in my life.

38:25.630 --> 38:28.019
Shame to ruin it
with all that meat.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.562
- Will knows, doesn't he?

38:35.440 --> 38:38.568
- He knows you killed
Nicholas Boyle, yes.

38:40.550 --> 38:42.518
(She sniffles.)

38:42.550 --> 38:44.711
- What am I gonna do?

38:44.750 --> 38:46.911
- He will keep our secret.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.820
- You don't know that.
- He will keep it

38:51.860 --> 38:55.523
because otherwise the one good
thing in his life is tainted.

38:55.560 --> 38:58.529
And he will lie to Jack Crawford
about you

38:58.570 --> 39:01.027
just as he has lied
to himself.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.837
You're free, Abigail.

39:04.870 --> 39:07.600
No one will know
what you did.

39:15.780 --> 39:18.943
And no one will know the truth
you're trying to av0id.

39:24.490 --> 39:27.653
The one you cannot admit

39:27.690 --> 39:29.851
even to yourself.

39:34.500 --> 39:37.469
- (softly): I helped him.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.867
- I can't hear you.
- I helped him.

39:40.910 --> 39:44.778
I knew what my father was.
I knew what he did. I... I knew.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.587
I was the one who...

39:52.620 --> 39:55.487
met the girls,

39:55.520 --> 39:57.659
talked to them.

40:00.090 --> 40:02.092
Laughed and joked.

40:04.830 --> 40:07.560
Found out where they lived,

40:07.600 --> 40:09.568
where they were going,

40:09.600 --> 40:11.761
when they'd be alone.

40:14.610 --> 40:16.874
Girls that looked
just like me.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.544
They could have been
my friends.

40:25.720 --> 40:28.553
I couldn't say no to him.
I knew...

40:30.720 --> 40:33.553
...I knew it was
them or me.

40:39.100 --> 40:41.568
(Abigail crying)

40:49.080 --> 40:52.049
- I wondered
when you would tell me.

40:54.250 --> 40:56.013
- I'm a monster.

40:56.050 --> 40:57.847
- No.

40:57.880 --> 41:00.542
I know what monsters are.

41:00.590 --> 41:03.514
You're a victim.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.721
And Will and I...

41:07.290 --> 41:09.952
...we're going to protect you.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.991
(She sniffles.)

41:20.770 --> 41:22.931
(train horn)

41:58.140 --> 41:59.607
- Mind ifI sit?

41:59.650 --> 42:00.947
- Oh, yeah, sure.

42:00.980 --> 42:03.847
- Thanks.
(Abigail clears her throat.)

42:03.880 --> 42:06.087
I hate traveling by myself.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.644
- I love it.

42:07.690 --> 42:09.885
- Where are you going?
- Home

42:09.920 --> 42:12.229
for the weekend.
How about you?

42:22.640 --> 42:25.905
