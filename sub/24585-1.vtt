01:06:00.826 --> 01:06:02.045
How about we get up
off this--

[Mister]
Ahem!

01:06:11.619 --> 01:06:13.839

[Mister]
Who are you?

01:06:25.894 --> 01:06:29.507
Please, don't make me
ask you again.

01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:32.423
I'm Moses.
This my brother Kitch.

01:06:32.466 --> 01:06:33.511
And we getting up--

01:06:33.554 --> 01:06:34.512

It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:02.018

Heh!
Gosh!

01:07:07.675 --> 01:07:12.115
You could say that we had
a bit of turbulence.

01:07:12.158 --> 01:07:14.247
A few more ups and downs than
we would've liked,

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:16.467
but all that is over now.

01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:18.077
It's passed.

01:07:19.644 --> 01:07:21.559
It's passed, because...

01:07:21.602 --> 01:07:25.128
because we have done
what we were meant to do.

01:07:26.999 --> 01:07:30.263
We stood our ground.
We caught the bad guys.

01:07:30.307 --> 01:07:36.052
We took back what was ours,
and now, together,

01:07:36.095 --> 01:07:40.752
we will make sure that
no one ever, ever, ever...

01:07:42.275 --> 01:07:44.190
takes it back from us again.

01:07:48.281 --> 01:07:50.022
