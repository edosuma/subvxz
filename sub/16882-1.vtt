WEBVTT

00:04.172 --> 00:05.373
>> BECCA: Vernon and I just

00:05.406 --> 00:06.574
want to thank you all for

00:06.607 --> 00:07.808
coming.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.843
Ever since I was a small girl,

00:09.877 --> 00:11.011
I've dreamt of this day.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.213
>> VERNON: Me, too.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.415
(laughter)

00:14.448 --> 00:16.016
>> BECCA: Sure, in my fantasy,

00:16.050 --> 00:17.385
it took place at Fraggle Rock.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.586
(laughter)

00:18.619 --> 00:20.221
I was marrying Johnny Depp.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.422
>> VERNON: Me, too.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.656
(laughter)

00:22.690 --> 00:23.857
(Becca clears her throat)

00:23.891 --> 00:24.992
>> BECCA: But in all

00:25.025 --> 00:27.828
seriousness, it is so amazing

00:27.861 --> 00:31.232
to be surrounded by so many

00:31.265 --> 00:32.833
people who care about us.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.336
We really feel...

00:35.369 --> 00:40.108
so much love from you guys.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.909
And as the Beatles said, "All

00:41.942 --> 00:44.011
you need is love."

00:44.044 --> 00:45.413
And a Vera Wang dress.

00:45.446 --> 00:46.614
(Becca chuckles)

00:46.647 --> 00:47.848
(laughter)

00:47.881 --> 00:50.017
Vernon and I are looking forward

00:50.050 --> 00:52.620
to seeing you at our 50th

00:52.653 --> 00:55.189
wedding anniversary.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.590
(Becca laughs)

00:56.624 --> 00:58.025
(crying): Promised myself I

00:58.058 --> 01:00.428
wasn't gonna do this.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.035
Uh, Jimmy, are you having a-a

01:08.068 --> 01:09.237
good time?

01:09.270 --> 01:10.438
>> JIMMY: Absolutely.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.273
Just so glad you invited me.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.142
>> BECCA: Really?

01:14.175 --> 01:15.409
>> JIMMY: Of course.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.077
Sometimes, well, you just want

01:17.111 --> 01:18.746
to witness the beginning of a

01:18.779 --> 01:20.981
disaster, so later, when the

01:21.014 --> 01:23.717
house is engulfed in flames,

01:23.751 --> 01:26.954
you can say, "Yup, I was there

01:26.987 --> 01:28.322
when they installed the faulty

01:28.356 --> 01:29.557
wiring."

01:29.590 --> 01:30.758
>> BECCA: Unbelievable.

01:30.791 --> 01:31.959
>> JIMMY: Just admit it.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.262
You only invited me here so you

01:34.295 --> 01:35.463
could passive-aggressively rub

01:35.496 --> 01:36.664
my nose in your happiness.

01:36.697 --> 01:37.898
At least I would have had the

01:37.931 --> 01:39.066
decency to rub your nose in it

01:39.099 --> 01:40.268
directly.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.469
>> BECCA: Oh, yes, your

01:41.502 --> 01:42.670
commitment to honesty is so

01:42.703 --> 01:43.904
refreshing.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.072
It must be so hard being the

01:45.105 --> 01:46.274
only one who sees people for

01:46.307 --> 01:47.475
what they actually are.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.642
>> JIMMY: It is.

01:48.676 --> 01:49.843
It's incredibly hard.

01:49.877 --> 01:50.844
>> BECCA: Well, it's also

01:50.878 --> 01:51.845
gonna be what keeps you alone,

01:51.879 --> 01:52.846
because you are ugly and

01:52.880 --> 01:53.847
unpleasant and honestly, Jimmy,

01:53.881 --> 01:54.848
you're not the original you

01:54.882 --> 01:56.016
think you are.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.251
>> JIMMY: I'm not original?

01:57.285 --> 01:58.452
Wow!

01:58.486 --> 01:59.653
That is hilarious, coming from

01:59.687 --> 02:00.854
such a...

02:00.888 --> 02:01.955
No, you're right.

02:01.989 --> 02:03.257
This day isn't about me, is it?

02:03.291 --> 02:04.458
>> BECCA: What were you gonna

02:04.492 --> 02:05.659
say?

02:05.693 --> 02:06.860
>> JIMMY: Forget it.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.028
>> BECCA: No, I'm serious.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.263
I really want to know what does

02:09.297 --> 02:10.464
(in British accent): the

02:10.498 --> 02:11.932
brilliant Jimmy Shive-Overly

02:11.965 --> 02:16.170
think about me?

02:16.204 --> 02:17.371
(Jimmy grunts)

02:17.405 --> 02:18.606
>> VERNON: You talk to her

02:18.639 --> 02:19.640
again, and me and my boys

02:19.673 --> 02:20.841
will mess you up.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.009
>> JIMMY: Who talks like that?

02:22.042 --> 02:23.211
>> VERNON: I'm serious, Jimmy.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.445
>> JIMMY: Fine, not a problem.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.514
Enjoy your sham of a marriage!

02:26.547 --> 02:30.083
>> VERNON: I will!

02:35.189 --> 02:36.357
>> GRETCHEN: You got another one

02:36.390 --> 02:39.993
of those?

02:41.195 --> 02:44.765
>> JIMMY: Pretty expensive.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.908
>> GRETCHEN: Good job in there.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.076
>> JIMMY: Getting married

02:56.109 --> 02:57.878
doesn't remove you from the

02:57.911 --> 02:59.046
burden of having to act like a

02:59.079 --> 03:00.248
human being.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.482
>> GRETCHEN: Totally.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.683
Those two are doomed.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.884
>> JIMMY: Right?

03:03.917 --> 03:06.086
Has any couple ever had a more

03:06.119 --> 03:07.321
dishonest start to a marriage?

03:07.355 --> 03:08.522
I mean, the balls to have a

03:08.556 --> 03:09.723
traditional Catholic ceremony.

03:09.757 --> 03:10.891
>> GRETCHEN: When she's already

03:10.924 --> 03:12.059
had two abortions.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.227
>> JIMMY: And can only orgasm

03:13.261 --> 03:14.428
through anal.

03:14.462 --> 03:17.097
(people gasp and mutter)

03:17.130 --> 03:18.332
>> JIMMY: Mr. and Mrs.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.533
Cottumaccio.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.734
>> MAN: Let's go inside.

03:20.768 --> 03:21.935
>> JIMMY: Old Cottumaccios.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.305
(man mutters)

03:26.039 --> 03:27.508
You're pretty.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.709
>> GRETCHEN: Thanks?

03:28.742 --> 03:29.910
>> JIMMY: How do you know her?

03:29.943 --> 03:31.078
>> GRETCHEN: I'm friends with

03:31.111 --> 03:32.280
the sister.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.514
>> JIMMY: Friends with Fat

03:33.547 --> 03:34.715
Lindsay?

03:34.748 --> 03:35.916
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, me and Fat

03:35.949 --> 03:37.084
Lindsay are hella close.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.286
>> JIMMY: So, uh, what you heard

03:38.319 --> 03:39.520
about me?

03:39.553 --> 03:40.721
>> GRETCHEN: Nothing, just that

03:40.754 --> 03:41.922
you're the worst.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.691
>> JIMMY: Says the girl who just

03:43.724 --> 03:47.528
stole a blender from a wedding.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.729
>> GRETCHEN: No.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.932
Really?

03:51.965 --> 03:53.033
Oh, man!

03:53.066 --> 03:54.735
I thought it was a food

03:54.768 --> 03:58.071
processor.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.273
>> JIMMY: Who's the worst now?

03:59.307 --> 04:02.910
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, well...

04:09.016 --> 04:10.217
>> GRETCHEN: I don't know what

04:10.250 --> 04:11.419
I'm doing here.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.620
I'm not even attracted to you.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.821
>> JIMMY: What does that have to

04:13.854 --> 04:16.557
do with anything?

04:16.590 --> 04:17.758
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah.

04:17.791 --> 04:18.959
>> * Don't look ahead

04:18.992 --> 04:20.127
There's stormy weather... *

04:20.160 --> 04:21.329
>> JIMMY: What? It's L.A.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.563
Who doesn't drive?

04:22.596 --> 04:23.764
>> GRETCHEN: DUI.

04:23.797 --> 04:24.965
I occasionally see this movie

04:24.998 --> 04:26.133
director guy.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.335
>> JIMMY: Gross.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.569
>> GRETCHEN: One time, he

04:28.602 --> 04:29.570
booty-texted me from some awards

04:29.603 --> 04:30.771
show.

04:30.804 --> 04:31.972
I was already at the bar, so I

04:32.005 --> 04:33.106
drove over to his house, and

04:33.140 --> 04:34.074
then he texted me he was going

04:34.107 --> 04:35.075
to be late, so I idly drove

04:35.108 --> 04:36.276
around his neighborhood...

04:36.310 --> 04:37.478
(chuckles): until I kind of

04:37.511 --> 04:38.679
sideswiped an off-duty cop.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.913
(Jimmy laughs)

04:39.947 --> 04:41.081
>> JIMMY: Do you know, I'm glad

04:41.114 --> 04:42.282
this is a one-night thing, so we

04:42.316 --> 04:43.484
can reveal all this awful shit

04:43.517 --> 04:44.685
about ourselves.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.919
>> GRETCHEN (chuckles): Totally.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.690
High five.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.059
I'll get that.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.600
Okay, I like that.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.801
>> JIMMY: All girls do.

05:00.834 --> 05:01.935
>> GRETCHEN: Don't call me "all

05:01.969 --> 05:04.972
girls."

05:05.005 --> 05:06.139
Damn it.

05:06.173 --> 05:07.341
That's good, too.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.542
>> * Don't look ahead

05:08.576 --> 05:09.777
There's stormy weather... *

05:09.810 --> 05:10.978
>> JIMMY: You know, right

05:11.011 --> 05:12.145
before Becca broke up with me, I

05:12.179 --> 05:13.313
started reading her e-mail.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.515
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, I've done that.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.683
>> JIMMY: So even though I had

05:15.716 --> 05:17.217
warning, when she broke up with

05:17.250 --> 05:19.687
me, it kind of... just kind of

05:19.720 --> 05:22.189
knocked me out.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.991
Even though she's clearly a

05:24.024 --> 05:25.192
ridiculous human being, you

05:25.225 --> 05:26.394
know?

05:26.427 --> 05:27.661
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah.

05:27.695 --> 05:28.862
Break-ups hurt.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.030
I've heard.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.999
I don't really do relationships.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.901
>> JIMMY: Me, neither.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.068
Anymore.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.804
>> GRETCHEN: So, what, are you

05:36.837 --> 05:39.407
one of those creepy foot guys?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.874
>> JIMMY: No.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.176
I have nervous hands, and they

05:43.210 --> 05:46.580
have to stay busy.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.849
(moaning)

05:48.882 --> 05:50.651
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, that's good.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.219
Oh, don't stop, you son of a

05:52.252 --> 05:53.387
bitch.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.588
Oh, yeah...

05:54.622 --> 05:55.823
(Jimmy spits)

05:55.856 --> 05:56.990
You just spit on it?

05:57.024 --> 05:58.191
>> JIMMY: Yeah.

05:58.225 --> 05:59.393
>> GRETCHEN: You just spit on my

05:59.427 --> 06:00.594
vagina.

06:00.628 --> 06:01.829
>> JIMMY: So?

06:01.862 --> 06:02.996
>> GRETCHEN: Don't!

06:03.030 --> 06:04.197
>> JIMMY: Why?

06:04.231 --> 06:05.399
>> GRETCHEN: Why don't spit on

06:05.433 --> 06:06.600
my vagina?

06:06.634 --> 06:07.835
>> JIMMY: It's saliva.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.002
It's gonna get there anyway.

06:09.036 --> 06:13.407
>> GRETCHEN: Hmm.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.742
And that's how I got crabs from

06:14.775 --> 06:17.110
my guidance counselor.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.345
(Gretchen chuckles)

06:18.378 --> 06:20.948
>> JIMMY (softly): Hey.

06:20.981 --> 06:24.552
>> GRETCHEN: Hey.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.256
>> JIMMY: Right.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.758
Uh, I should get some sleep,

06:30.791 --> 06:31.959
so...

06:31.992 --> 06:35.563
>> GRETCHEN: Right. Good night.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.764
>> JIMMY: Wait. What?

06:36.797 --> 06:38.131
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, relax.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.366
I'm just lazy.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.134
I'll sneak out in the morning.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.703
>> JIMMY: No, there are no

06:42.736 --> 06:43.904
sleepovers.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.072
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, too bad.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.575
>> JIMMY: I have sleep apnea.

06:47.608 --> 06:48.776
I have to wear a CPAP machine.

06:48.809 --> 06:49.977
>> GRETCHEN: Don't care.

06:50.010 --> 06:53.614
I'm a log.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.720
(CPAP machine beeps, whirrs)

06:59.753 --> 07:00.921
(Gretchen laughs)

07:00.954 --> 07:03.390
You look like Top Gun.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.592
>> JIMMY: Shut up.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.893
>> GRETCHEN: I'm so glad I'm not

07:05.926 --> 07:06.894
gonna remember any of this in

07:06.927 --> 07:08.061
the morning.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.262
(machine whirrs rhythmically)

07:09.296 --> 07:10.464
"Never leave your wingman."

07:10.498 --> 07:12.065
(both laugh)

07:12.099 --> 07:14.535
>> JIMMY: So stupid.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.979
(Jimmy sighs)

07:26.013 --> 07:28.916
>> EDGAR: Morning.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.618
So, I've been thinking about

07:30.651 --> 07:31.785
ghosts.

07:31.819 --> 07:32.786
>> JIMMY: Oh, the things that

07:32.820 --> 07:33.787
don't exist because there is

07:33.821 --> 07:34.788
no soul?

07:34.822 --> 07:35.789
>> EDGAR: Mm...

07:35.823 --> 07:36.790
>> JIMMY: What a great use of

07:36.824 --> 07:37.791
your time.

07:37.825 --> 07:38.792
>> EDGAR: You know my

07:38.826 --> 07:39.793
great-grandfather Baldemar on my

07:39.827 --> 07:40.794
father's side, right?

07:40.828 --> 07:41.795
>> JIMMY: What? No. How could I

07:41.829 --> 07:42.796
possibly know your great...?

07:42.830 --> 07:43.797
>> EDGAR: Oh, he was this crazy

07:43.831 --> 07:44.798
adventurer guy who owned a ranch

07:44.832 --> 07:45.799
in Zihuatanejo, and he sold arms

07:45.833 --> 07:46.800
and was a matador.

07:46.834 --> 07:47.801
>> JIMMY: What was his name?

07:47.835 --> 07:49.002
Voldemort? Never mind.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.003
>> EDGAR: The coolest guy.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.004
Because I was thinking, he

07:51.038 --> 07:52.005
sounds like he had it all worked

07:52.039 --> 07:53.006
out, and maybe if I could learn

07:53.040 --> 07:54.007
his secrets, then I could fix my

07:54.041 --> 07:55.208
problems.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.443
>> JIMMY: How would meeting your

07:56.476 --> 07:57.444
dead relative help you move out

07:57.477 --> 07:58.612
of my house?

07:58.646 --> 07:59.813
>> EDGAR: No, I'm talking about

07:59.847 --> 08:01.014
my real problems.

08:01.048 --> 08:01.882
Like, the nightmares and the

08:01.915 --> 08:02.983
crying, and how I want to do

08:03.016 --> 08:05.452
heroin all the time.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.987
So, anyway, what do you think?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.288
>> JIMMY: What do I think about

08:08.321 --> 08:09.456
what?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.524
>> EDGAR: If I should hold a

08:10.558 --> 08:11.725
séance to contact

08:11.759 --> 08:12.960
great-grandfather Baldemar.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.162
>> JIMMY: No.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.363
>> EDGAR: I think I'm gonna do

08:16.396 --> 08:17.531
it.

08:17.565 --> 08:20.033
Thanks.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.468
>> GRETCHEN: Why did you let me

08:21.501 --> 08:22.703
sleep so late?

08:22.736 --> 08:25.038
I'm famished.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.040
Nice place.

08:28.842 --> 08:29.810
>> EDGAR: Hi.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.811
I'm Edgar.

08:30.844 --> 08:31.812
>> GRETCHEN: Mmm. Gretchen.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.813
This is dynamite.

08:32.846 --> 08:33.814
>> EDGAR: Oh, thanks.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.015
>> GRETCHEN: So, how do you guys

08:35.048 --> 08:36.216
know each other?

08:36.249 --> 08:37.217
>> EDGAR: Uh, we met in college.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.418
>> JIMMY: No, we didn't.

08:38.451 --> 08:39.419
>> EDGAR: Well, he was in

08:39.452 --> 08:40.420
college, and I sold weed to

08:40.453 --> 08:41.655
college kids.

08:41.689 --> 08:42.590
Then he started giving me books

08:42.623 --> 08:43.757
to read, 'cause he saw untapped

08:43.791 --> 08:44.992
potential in me.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.193
>> JIMMY: I gave you books that

08:46.226 --> 08:47.394
I stole from Borders because I

08:47.427 --> 08:48.596
didn't have money for weed.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.763
>> EDGAR: Semantics.

08:49.797 --> 08:50.998
Have you read his book yet?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.199
>> GRETCHEN: No.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.200
>> EDGAR: Sales were flatter

08:53.233 --> 08:54.201
than expected, plus he blew

08:54.234 --> 08:55.202
all his money on this house.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.203
That's why he has to do more

08:56.236 --> 08:57.204
magazine work, but you should

08:57.237 --> 08:58.405
read it.

08:58.438 --> 08:59.607
It's real good.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.774
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

09:00.808 --> 09:01.909
>> JIMMY: At least buy your own

09:01.942 --> 09:03.210
copy.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.411
>> GRETCHEN (laughs): Right.

09:04.444 --> 09:05.613
So, which one of you is giving

09:05.646 --> 09:07.748
me a ride to work?

09:07.781 --> 09:09.382
>> EDGAR: I can't drive because

09:09.416 --> 09:11.752
I have PTSD and mild to medium

09:11.785 --> 09:12.920
battlefield-induced psychosis.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.121
>> GRETCHEN: Bummer.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.355
Jimmy, you're up.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.556
>> JIMMY: My car's at the

09:16.590 --> 09:17.758
reception.

09:17.791 --> 09:18.926
We took a cab.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.928
>> GRETCHEN: We did?

09:20.961 --> 09:23.330
Damn.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.109
>> LINDSAY: I can't believe it.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.110
>> GRETCHEN: Drive faster.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.111
I'm late.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.112
>> LINDSAY: You slept with

09:39.146 --> 09:40.113
Jimmy.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.114
>> GRETCHEN: Apparently.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.115
>> LINDSAY: Who used to date my

09:42.149 --> 09:43.116
sister.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.117
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, I know.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.118
>> LINDSAY: And on the night of

09:45.152 --> 09:46.119
her wedding?

09:46.153 --> 09:47.120
>> GRETCHEN: Why are you

09:47.154 --> 09:48.121
crawling up my ass about this,

09:48.155 --> 09:49.122
Lindsay?

09:49.156 --> 09:50.123
>> LINDSAY: You know what a jerk

09:50.157 --> 09:51.124
he is.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.125
I told you all the time how

09:52.159 --> 09:53.126
he swallowed her up.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.127
She disappeared her life into

09:54.161 --> 09:55.128
his and was never the same.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.229
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, that's 'cause

09:56.263 --> 09:57.230
Becca doesn't have a personality

09:57.264 --> 09:58.231
to begin with.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.232
>> LINDSAY: Well, that's true.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.835
Ugh! Oh, Jimmy's the worst.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.004
Did he say anything about me?

10:04.037 --> 10:05.238
>> GRETCHEN: Nope.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.306
>> LINDSAY: You're not gonna see

10:06.339 --> 10:07.307
him again, are you?

10:07.340 --> 10:09.142
>> GRETCHEN: No way.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.477
We did have fun, though.

10:10.510 --> 10:11.478
(Lindsay groans)

10:11.511 --> 10:12.980
Oh, God, I hope he doesn't think

10:13.013 --> 10:13.981
it was, like, an actual thing.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.182
>> LINDSAY: No kidding.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.416
Um, get...

10:16.449 --> 10:17.517
Can you be careful where you're

10:17.550 --> 10:18.752
putting your makeup, and can you

10:18.786 --> 10:19.920
take your feet off the

10:19.953 --> 10:21.121
dashboard?

10:21.154 --> 10:23.623
This is a lease.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.792
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

10:24.825 --> 10:25.993
(phone buzzing)

10:26.026 --> 10:27.194
Stop the car.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.428
>> LINDSAY: What?

10:28.461 --> 10:29.629
>> GRETCHEN: Stop the car!

10:29.663 --> 10:31.198
I'd rather walk than drive in

10:31.231 --> 10:32.432
this sterile, suburban, piece

10:32.465 --> 10:33.633
of shit car with my best friend

10:33.667 --> 10:34.802
being shitty and judgmental to

10:34.835 --> 10:36.003
me 'cause I had sex with a guy

10:36.036 --> 10:37.204
at a wedding.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.438
How many guys did you blow at

10:38.471 --> 10:42.342
our five-year reunion?

10:42.375 --> 10:43.543
>> LINDSAY: Four.

10:43.576 --> 10:44.778
>> GRETCHEN: Four?

10:44.812 --> 10:45.946
You told me three.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.114
>> LINDSAY: I might have left

10:47.147 --> 10:48.315
out Tor Borgfeldt.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.516
>> GRETCHEN: Ew!

10:49.549 --> 10:50.718
I'm seriously nauseated right

10:50.751 --> 10:51.885
now.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.120
>> LINDSAY: Oh, God.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.321
We used to have so much fun.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.056
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, we did.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.290
Why'd you have to get married?

10:57.324 --> 10:58.491
>> LINDSAY: I know.

10:58.525 --> 11:01.061
I'm sorry.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.662
Do you like my new haircut?

11:02.696 --> 11:03.831
>> GRETCHEN: No, you look like

11:03.864 --> 11:05.032
Ellen Barkin.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.299
If you get your real estate

11:06.333 --> 11:07.500
license, I will stab you in the

11:07.534 --> 11:11.905
tits.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.251
>> JIMMY: Brilliant.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.686
Absolutely brilliant.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.257
>> KILLIAN: Hi.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.161
>> JIMMY: What?

11:34.194 --> 11:36.396
>> KILLIAN: I just moved in...

11:36.429 --> 11:37.597
over there.

11:37.630 --> 11:38.832
>> JIMMY: Of course you did.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.600
>> KILLIAN: Why do you say that?

11:40.633 --> 11:41.835
>> JIMMY: Because the death of

11:41.869 --> 11:43.036
any interesting neighborhood is

11:43.070 --> 11:45.372
the influx of white procreators.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.874
>> KILLIAN: Oh, that's cool.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.876
My nutritionist is gay, too.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.844
>> JIMMY: I'm not gay.

11:50.878 --> 11:51.845
I'm English.

11:51.879 --> 11:52.846
(Jimmy sighs)

11:52.880 --> 11:53.847
>> KILLIAN: What's that?

11:53.881 --> 11:55.849
>> JIMMY: A royalty check for my

11:55.883 --> 12:01.088
book for... $17.43.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.555
Do you know, if there was any

12:02.589 --> 12:03.957
doubt that the book industry was

12:03.991 --> 12:06.626
dead, it is here in my hand.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.395
R.I.P., literature.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.763
2000 BC to this moment.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.231
>> KILLIAN: You want to hang out

12:11.264 --> 12:12.966
sometime?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.701
>> JIMMY: What?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.870
What are you even talking about?

12:16.904 --> 12:18.071
I'm an adult.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.940
Do you know what that means?

12:19.973 --> 12:21.608
It means that I am beset upon at

12:21.641 --> 12:23.811
all times by a tsunami of

12:23.844 --> 12:25.412
complex thoughts and struggles,

12:25.445 --> 12:27.247
unceasingly aware of my own

12:27.280 --> 12:28.648
mortality and able to

12:28.681 --> 12:30.250
contemplate the futility of

12:30.283 --> 12:31.885
everything and yet still rage

12:31.919 --> 12:34.788
against the dying of the light.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.157
So do you see how monumentally

12:37.190 --> 12:40.160
stupid you, a child, asking me

12:40.193 --> 12:42.662
"do I want to hang out sometime"

12:42.695 --> 12:44.064
is?

12:44.097 --> 12:45.065
>> KILLIAN: My dad designs

12:45.098 --> 12:46.066
video games.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.836
We get all the new ones early.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.238
>> JIMMY: Come over around 8:00.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.506
>> * As rumor has it still

12:53.540 --> 12:54.607
I followed the rules

12:54.641 --> 12:56.109
Of Frank Abagnale

12:56.143 --> 12:57.945
* So catch me if you can

12:57.978 --> 12:58.946
There ain't people... *

12:58.979 --> 13:00.280
>> GRETCHEN: What the crap?!

13:00.313 --> 13:01.281
>> SAM: You know I get nervous

13:01.314 --> 13:02.282
at these shits.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.283
>> GRETCHEN: You are paying a

13:03.316 --> 13:04.284
guy to take your photograph, and

13:04.317 --> 13:05.418
you trash his studio?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.920
>> SAM: You weren't here!

13:06.954 --> 13:08.688
Unprofessional as shit!

13:08.721 --> 13:10.123
A publicist who can't show up at

13:10.157 --> 13:11.124
publicity events?

13:11.158 --> 13:12.192
Don't even know what I'm paying

13:12.225 --> 13:13.193
you for, Gretchen!

13:13.226 --> 13:14.194
>> GRETCHEN: The label pays me.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.195
>> SAM: You know it all gets

13:15.228 --> 13:16.696
charged against my end, bitch!

13:16.729 --> 13:18.298
Label is villains.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.666
From now on, I'm just gonna drop

13:19.699 --> 13:21.935
free mix tapes and Vines of my

13:21.969 --> 13:23.270
guinea pigs!

13:23.303 --> 13:24.271
>> GRETCHEN: You need to

13:24.304 --> 13:25.672
apologize to Nestor so he

13:25.705 --> 13:26.806
doesn't sue you.

13:26.840 --> 13:27.807
>> SAM: Let him.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.809
I'll lawyer the hell up!

13:29.843 --> 13:30.810
>> GRETCHEN: Nestor is a great

13:30.844 --> 13:31.811
photographer.

13:31.845 --> 13:32.812
We need him.

13:32.846 --> 13:33.780
>> SAM: Anyone's a good

13:33.813 --> 13:35.615
photographer now.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.783
Shitstain take amazing

13:36.816 --> 13:39.352
Instagrams.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.687
>> SHITSTAIN: No filter.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.123
>> HONEY NUTZ: Yeah! @Shitstain!

13:43.156 --> 13:44.124
>> SAM: Anyway, bitch, this is

13:44.157 --> 13:45.125
your fault.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.526
You need to apologize to him for

13:46.559 --> 13:47.527
being such a no-showing-up

13:47.560 --> 13:48.528
bitch!

13:48.561 --> 13:50.030
>> * Get down, get down

13:56.069 --> 13:57.070
your shit.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.671
>> GRETCHEN: Okay, good.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.040
Nestor, we'll talk about

14:00.073 --> 14:02.442
restitution?

14:05.245 --> 14:07.047
Hey.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.048
You okay?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.049
>> SAM: Yeah.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.050
Hell were you doing anyway?

14:10.083 --> 14:11.051
>> GRETCHEN: Nothing worth

14:11.084 --> 14:12.052
talking about.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.053
>> SAM: You still need to make

14:13.086 --> 14:14.054
it up to us.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.255
I'll fire your ass, and it won't

14:15.288 --> 14:16.323
mean shit to me.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.657
>> GRETCHEN: Yes, it will.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.658
>> SAM: I'm serious.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.660
You owe me, Gretch.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.395
>> GRETCHEN: Okay, Sam.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.763
What do you need?

14:23.796 --> 14:25.165
>> SAM: You need to kiss my

14:25.198 --> 14:27.067
quarter-Chickasaw ass!

14:27.100 --> 14:28.535
Then you need to get me some

14:28.568 --> 14:29.536
cocaine.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.604
I'm too famous to get it myself.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.872
I'm not playing.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.042
You on probation now.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.876
Yo!

14:36.910 --> 14:38.946
Ooh! Wait now. Hold on!

14:38.979 --> 14:40.580
High five. Put her there.

14:40.613 --> 14:41.949
She's hot.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.356
(door unlocks)

14:49.389 --> 14:50.757
>> EDGAR: I got your car towed

14:50.790 --> 14:51.791
back here.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.060
And look who I found getting out

14:53.093 --> 14:55.428
of a cab.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.201
>> GRETCHEN: Don't worry.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.136
I forgot my purse.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.438
Not on purpose or anything.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.439
>> EDGAR: I'm gonna leave you

15:06.473 --> 15:08.408
two alone.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.277
>> GRETCHEN: He's sweet.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.278
It's nice that you let him live

15:11.311 --> 15:12.279
here.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.446
>> JIMMY: You know your purse

15:13.480 --> 15:14.647
had food in it.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.483
It was covered in ants.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.484
Who keeps food in their purse?

15:17.517 --> 15:18.485
>> GRETCHEN: Whoa.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.486
What's your problem?

15:19.519 --> 15:20.487
>> JIMMY: Well, I've had a

15:20.520 --> 15:21.488
really shitty day.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.589
And then I come home to find

15:22.622 --> 15:24.224
that my bedroom is a goddamn

15:24.257 --> 15:25.792
'50s sci-fi movie.

15:25.825 --> 15:26.893
And why would you stay over,

15:26.926 --> 15:29.162
huh?

15:29.196 --> 15:31.164
That's amateur hour.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.232
>> GRETCHEN: Here I was worried

15:32.265 --> 15:33.233
you were gonna get the wrong

15:33.266 --> 15:34.234
idea about last night.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.235
So thank you for saving me the

15:35.268 --> 15:36.236
speech.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.237
>> JIMMY: You were gonna make a

15:37.270 --> 15:38.171
speech?

15:38.205 --> 15:39.439
>> GRETCHEN: Okay, forget it.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.440
>> JIMMY: Yeah, no kidding.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.975
Save your breath.

15:42.009 --> 15:42.976
>> GRETCHEN: I don't know what

15:43.010 --> 15:44.344
planet that you're from, but on

15:44.377 --> 15:45.912
my planet, someone like you does

15:45.945 --> 15:48.581
not just get... this!

15:48.615 --> 15:49.816
Congratulations, you bagged a

15:49.849 --> 15:50.817
weakened gazelle.

15:50.850 --> 15:51.818
That's right.

15:51.851 --> 15:52.819
I'm still stupid-hooked on

15:52.852 --> 15:53.920
someone else who is eons further

15:53.953 --> 15:54.921
than you in the evolutionary

15:54.954 --> 15:56.256
scale in all categories except

15:56.289 --> 15:57.924
maybe unearned ego and back fat.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.460
What? You so value honesty, you

16:00.493 --> 16:02.095
had to chew a bride out on her

16:02.129 --> 16:03.496
wedding day in the name of it?

16:03.530 --> 16:04.497
Well, why don't you face this

16:04.531 --> 16:05.832
giant hunk of truth, Jimmy?

16:05.865 --> 16:07.434
There is a fat asterisk next to

16:07.467 --> 16:08.668
my name on your skank-ridden

16:08.701 --> 16:09.936
little bone list and it reads,

16:09.969 --> 16:11.804
"She probably would've gone home

16:11.838 --> 16:14.041
with anyone that night!"

16:14.074 --> 16:15.775
So thank you!

16:15.808 --> 16:17.477
Thank you for my wake-up call,

16:17.510 --> 16:19.679
Jimmy Stupid-Three-Names.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.681
You are officially my bottom.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.527
Hey, you.

16:34.561 --> 16:35.828
>> TY: Kiddo.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.064
What a surprise.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.065
>> GRETCHEN: I was just in the

16:38.098 --> 16:39.066
neighborhood.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.067
>> TY: Uh, I have an early call

16:40.100 --> 16:41.168
time.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.902
But...

16:42.935 --> 16:45.004
Yeah, come in.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.373
Last time you said you were

16:46.406 --> 16:47.407
coming over, you never showed.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.408
I thought you'd grown sick of

16:48.441 --> 16:49.409
me.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.410
>> GRETCHEN: Nah, you're all

16:50.443 --> 16:51.844
right.

16:51.878 --> 16:52.845
>> TY: You're so beautiful,

16:52.879 --> 16:55.248
Gretchen.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.198
(hip-hop music playing)

17:17.137 --> 17:18.105
>> EDGAR: Hi.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.106
>> KILLIAN: Hi.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.107
>> EDGAR: You busy, Jimmy?

17:20.140 --> 17:21.108
>> JIMMY: Yep.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.175
>> EDGAR: Well, could you, like,

17:22.209 --> 17:23.410
pause it for a second?

17:23.443 --> 17:25.778
>> JIMMY: No.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.017
What's wrong with you?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.018
Give me the controller.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.019
>> EDGAR: No.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.421
I've watched you for two years

17:34.454 --> 17:35.422
now get girls to come home with

17:35.455 --> 17:36.423
you, and they're always gone in

17:36.456 --> 17:37.557
in the morning.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.558
>> JIMMY: Sorry, I can help it

17:38.591 --> 17:41.094
if she refused to leave?

17:41.128 --> 17:42.061
Give me my controller.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.796
>> EDGAR: No.

17:43.830 --> 17:44.864
>> JIMMY: Fine.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.599
(video game character screams)

17:46.633 --> 17:47.600
>> EDGAR: I'm sorry I have to do

17:47.634 --> 17:48.601
this.

17:48.635 --> 17:49.602
Now, I don't mind you being

17:49.636 --> 17:50.603
jerky with me because I know you

17:50.637 --> 17:51.604
care.

17:51.638 --> 17:52.605
>> JIMMY: What the...

17:52.639 --> 17:53.606
No, I don't.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.607
>> EDGAR: Yes, you do.

17:54.641 --> 17:55.608
>> JIMMY: You're just an animal

17:55.642 --> 17:56.609
living in my house.

17:56.643 --> 17:57.610
>> EDGAR: But Gretchen stayed,

17:57.644 --> 17:58.611
okay?

17:58.645 --> 17:59.812
You say she forced you, but we

17:59.846 --> 18:01.114
both know there's not a person

18:01.148 --> 18:02.282
on this planet that's ever had a

18:02.315 --> 18:03.450
good outcome trying to force you

18:03.483 --> 18:05.618
to do anything.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.987
She stayed, man.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.589
And that means something,

18:09.622 --> 18:10.590
whether you want to admit it or

18:10.623 --> 18:12.425
not.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.662
I'm gonna let you go now.

18:15.695 --> 18:16.663
>> JIMMY: Why would I even

18:16.696 --> 18:17.964
listen to you, eh?

18:17.997 --> 18:19.666
You're a mental case.

18:19.699 --> 18:20.833
You're on, like, a billion

18:20.867 --> 18:22.235
medications that all say "Take

18:22.269 --> 18:24.337
for batshit craziness."

18:24.371 --> 18:25.338
>> EDGAR: I was defending our

18:25.372 --> 18:26.339
country.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.340
>> JIMMY: Oh, please.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.341
You weren't defending anything

18:28.375 --> 18:29.609
except for the business

18:29.642 --> 18:30.777
interests of evil men.

18:30.810 --> 18:31.778
>> EDGAR: Jimmy, our country is

18:31.811 --> 18:32.979
the business interests of evil

18:33.012 --> 18:34.514
men.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.682
>> JIMMY: That may be the most

18:35.715 --> 18:36.783
intelligent thing you've ever

18:36.816 --> 18:38.117
said.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.118
>> EDGAR: Thanks.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.119
>> JIMMY: You're still a goddamn

18:40.153 --> 18:41.120
lunatic.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.121
>> EDGAR: Hey, wait.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.122
Come on, man.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.191
W-Wait. Where are you doing?

18:44.224 --> 18:45.692
>> JIMMY: To a bar, where I can

18:45.725 --> 18:46.793
drink in peace.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.895
Come on, Killian.

18:52.532 --> 18:53.500
All right, call the police.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.501
>> EDGAR: On me?

18:54.534 --> 18:55.502
>> JIMMY: Someone's stolen my

18:55.535 --> 18:56.503
car.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.504
>> EDGAR: No, Gretchen took it,

18:57.537 --> 18:58.505
remember?

18:58.538 --> 18:59.506
>> JIMMY: Gretchen took my...

18:59.539 --> 19:00.507
Sorry, Gretchen took my car?

19:00.540 --> 19:01.508
>> EDGAR: Yeah.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.509
I saw her driving it away

19:02.542 --> 19:03.510
earlier.

19:03.543 --> 19:04.511
I figured you loaned it to her.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.478
Come to think of it, I did think

19:05.512 --> 19:06.479
that was kind of weird.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.480
>> JIMMY: She doesn't have a

19:07.514 --> 19:08.481
license!

19:08.515 --> 19:09.482
>> EDGAR: Huh.

19:09.516 --> 19:10.483
She must've stolen your keys

19:10.517 --> 19:12.385
from the counter.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.886
You got to admit, that's kind of

19:13.920 --> 19:17.524
a baller move.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.960
(chuckles)

19:20.993 --> 19:23.029
>> KILLIAN: You guys are fun.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.869
(grunting)

19:32.739 --> 19:35.342
>> GRETCHEN: Um, hey.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.009
>> TY: Yes, Gretchen?

19:37.043 --> 19:38.010
>> GRETCHEN: Can we just take a

19:38.044 --> 19:39.746
little break?

19:39.779 --> 19:43.850
>> TY (chuckles): Sure.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.253
(sighing)

19:49.789 --> 19:52.525
>> GRETCHEN: So... what's the

19:52.559 --> 19:54.661
worst thing you've ever done?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.496
>> TY: Gretchen, you know ever

19:56.529 --> 19:57.497
since India I don't dwell in

19:57.530 --> 19:59.732
negativity.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.268
>> GRETCHEN: I set my high

20:01.301 --> 20:02.402
school on fire to get out of a

20:02.435 --> 20:04.170
math test.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.672
(chuckles)

20:05.705 --> 20:06.773
>> TY: What?

20:06.806 --> 20:08.741
Why are you telling me that?

20:08.775 --> 20:10.377
That's horrible.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.379
>> GRETCHEN: Never mind.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.747
Kidding.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.054
(moans)

20:22.088 --> 20:25.057
>> TY: Oh, you're a marvel.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.793
(pants)

20:26.826 --> 20:28.295
Ooh, that's terrific.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.296
Yeah.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.964
(Gretchen spits)

20:31.998 --> 20:34.567
Did you just spit on me?

20:34.601 --> 20:36.936
>> GRETCHEN: No.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.639
Yes. Sorry.

20:39.672 --> 20:44.411
>> TY (chuckles): Oh, Gretch.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.746
Mmm.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.248
That's delicious.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.483
>> GRETCHEN: Do you still have

20:50.517 --> 20:52.919
cocaine?

21:16.943 --> 21:19.278
(sighs)

21:19.312 --> 21:21.914
(snorts)

21:21.948 --> 21:23.350
(phone rings)

21:23.383 --> 21:26.853
(exhales)

21:26.886 --> 21:29.155
(sniffs)

21:32.224 --> 21:33.760
>> GRETCHEN: Hello?

21:33.793 --> 21:36.429
>> JIMMY: What are you doing?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.197
>> GRETCHEN: Nothing. Just...

21:38.230 --> 21:39.332
(sniffs)

21:39.366 --> 21:40.867
...reading.

21:40.900 --> 21:41.868
>> JIMMY: Hey, you won't

21:41.901 --> 21:42.869
believe this.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.771
Someone stole my car.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.138
>> GRETCHEN: Oh.

21:46.172 --> 21:49.008
God, that's... awful.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.343
>> JIMMY: Yeah, I have to file a

21:50.377 --> 21:51.944
police report in the morning.

21:51.978 --> 21:52.945
>> GRETCHEN: I may have borrowed

21:52.979 --> 21:53.946
it.

21:53.980 --> 21:54.947
>> JIMMY: I know.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.683
>> GRETCHEN: Oh.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.985
Well, sorry.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.787
I told you I'm the worst.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.321
>> JIMMY: Actually, no, you said

22:02.355 --> 22:04.323
that I was the worst and that I

22:04.357 --> 22:05.658
was lucky to get you.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.527
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah. About that...

22:07.560 --> 22:08.561
>> JIMMY: No, don't apologize.

22:08.595 --> 22:09.962
It was a great speech.

22:09.996 --> 22:15.001
It was funny and true and mean.

22:15.034 --> 22:18.304
My favorite kind.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.906
>> GRETCHEN: I set my school on

22:19.939 --> 22:22.475
fire to get out of a math test.

22:22.509 --> 22:23.976
(Jimmy laughs)

22:24.010 --> 22:25.077
>> JIMMY: That's genius.

22:25.111 --> 22:28.415
Oh, and... I... lied to you

22:28.448 --> 22:30.817
before.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.653
I do have a foot thing.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.388
>> GRETCHEN: Seriously?

22:35.422 --> 22:36.656
>> JIMMY: Yeah.

22:36.689 --> 22:37.990
In fact, I was just trying to

22:38.024 --> 22:39.325
find the right clip online to,

22:39.358 --> 22:41.694
you know... s-so that I could

22:41.728 --> 22:43.496
fall asleep.

22:43.530 --> 22:47.834
But... nothing's quite right.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.002
>> GRETCHEN: Oh.

22:50.036 --> 22:53.940
Do you want me to try?

22:53.973 --> 22:55.842
>> JIMMY: What?

22:55.875 --> 22:57.176
>> GRETCHEN: Shh. Let me think.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.177
>> JIMMY: Come on, this is

22:58.210 --> 22:59.446
stupid.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.614
>> GRETCHEN: Shut up.

23:01.648 --> 23:03.783
I have been walking around

23:03.816 --> 23:07.353
all day in these new shoes,

23:07.386 --> 23:10.356
and they are just so...

23:10.389 --> 23:13.359
hot and tight.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.694
>> JIMMY: Oh, yeah?

23:14.727 --> 23:16.763
>> GRETCHEN: And my socks are

23:16.796 --> 23:21.067
so... sweaty.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.401
>> JIMMY: That happens.

23:22.435 --> 23:23.402
>> GRETCHEN: I think I might

23:23.436 --> 23:25.638
just have to take them off.

23:25.672 --> 23:28.107
>> JIMMY: You do that.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.742
Hey, you're, uh... very nice for

23:29.776 --> 23:33.145
doing this.

23:33.179 --> 23:36.382
>> GRETCHEN: I am very nice.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.318
Jimmy... I'm scared of this

23:39.351 --> 23:42.321
shit, you know?

23:42.354 --> 23:44.791
I don't like it.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.225
>> JIMMY: I don't believe in it

23:46.258 --> 23:48.294
anymore, so...

23:48.327 --> 23:49.496
>> GRETCHEN: So if we both know

23:49.529 --> 23:50.630
that it can't work, then there's

23:50.663 --> 23:52.899
no harm.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.668
Right?

23:55.702 --> 23:58.104
>> JIMMY: Right.

24:01.608 --> 24:04.443
What kind of socks?

24:04.477 --> 24:06.112
>> GRETCHEN: Mmm... knee-high

24:06.145 --> 24:07.747
basketball socks.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.082
Orange and green stripes.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.350
>> JIMMY: You're amazing.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.685
You're 19 types of trouble

24:12.719 --> 24:15.287
but... amazing.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.690
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, so are you.

24:17.724 --> 24:20.593
19 types.

24:20.627 --> 24:21.594
Well, it's late.

24:21.628 --> 24:22.595
Did you finish?

24:22.629 --> 24:23.596
>> JIMMY: I think the moment's

24:23.630 --> 24:24.597
gone, isn't it?

24:24.631 --> 24:25.598
>> GRETCHEN: All right.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.599
Have a good night.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.600
Call me.

24:27.634 --> 24:28.635
>> JIMMY: I will.
