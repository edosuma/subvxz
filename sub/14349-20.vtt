Captain's log, stardate 2947.3.

00:07.792 --> 00:10.497
We have been through
a severe ion storm.

00:10.670 --> 00:12.080
One crewman is dead.

00:12.255 --> 00:14.828
Ship's damage is considerable.

00:15.007 --> 00:19.087
I have ordered a nonscheduled
layover on Starbase 11 for repairs.

00:19.845 --> 00:22.514
A full report of damages was made
to the commanding officer

00:22.681 --> 00:25.931
of Starbase 11, Commodore Stone.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.851
Maintenance Section 18.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.639
Your section is working
on the Intrepid.

00:33.816 --> 00:36.354
Reschedule.
The Enterprise is on priority one.

00:39.446 --> 00:41.569
That makes three times
you've read it, Jim.

00:42.365 --> 00:44.986
- Is there an error?
- No.

00:46.452 --> 00:49.868
- But the death of a crewman...
- Regulations, captain.

00:53.584 --> 00:57.913
The extracts from your ship's computer
log confirming this sworn deposition?

00:58.380 --> 01:00.953
- Kirk to Enterprise.
- Bridge here. Go ahead, captain.

01:01.132 --> 01:03.291
Where's Mr. Spock
with that computer log extract?

01:04.052 --> 01:06.128
Well, he should've been
there ten minutes ago, sir.

01:06.304 --> 01:08.213
- Kirk, out.
- It's a great pity.

01:08.389 --> 01:11.058
The service can't afford to lose men
like Lieutenant Commander Finney.

01:11.225 --> 01:14.391
I agree. I waited until the last
possible moment.

01:14.561 --> 01:17.099
We were on red alert.
The storm got worse.

01:17.272 --> 01:19.265
I had to jettison the pod.

01:27.907 --> 01:29.235
What took you so long,
Mr. Spock?

01:29.742 --> 01:31.366
Captain...

01:31.535 --> 01:33.777
- I believe l...
- I'll take that.

01:41.419 --> 01:43.661
- Jame.
- There you are.

01:43.838 --> 01:45.961
I just wanted one more look at you.

01:46.132 --> 01:49.168
- The man who killed my father.
- That's not so. He was my friend.

01:49.343 --> 01:52.260
Your friend?
You hated him all your life,

01:52.429 --> 01:55.050
and that's why you killed him.
You murderer!

01:55.223 --> 01:58.094
You murderer! You murderer!

01:59.602 --> 02:01.061
Jame.

02:04.899 --> 02:07.520
Mr. Spock, would you please?

02:08.651 --> 02:10.692
Miss Finney, come with me, please.

02:16.409 --> 02:17.572
Captain Kirk,

02:17.744 --> 02:20.235
you say you jettisoned
the pod after the red alert?

02:20.413 --> 02:21.788
You have my sworn deposition.

02:22.290 --> 02:25.207
Then, captain, I must presume
you have committed wilful perjury.

02:26.460 --> 02:29.033
This extract from your computer
log says you jettisoned the pod

02:29.213 --> 02:30.411
before going to red alert.

02:31.590 --> 02:33.831
Consider yourself
confined to the base.

02:34.009 --> 02:37.175
An official enquiry will determine
if a general court-martial is in order.

02:45.019 --> 02:48.304
Space, the final frontier.

02:49.147 --> 02:52.682
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:52.859 --> 02:56.773
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

02:57.947 --> 03:00.817
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

03:01.784 --> 03:04.987
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

Captain's log, stardate 2948.5.

03:42.112 --> 03:45.528
Starship Enterprise remains
in orbit around Starbase 11.

03:45.699 --> 03:47.608
Full repairs in progress.

03:48.034 --> 03:50.276
I have been ordered
to stand by on Starbase 11

03:50.453 --> 03:53.026
until the enquiry into the death
of Lieutenant Commander Finney

03:53.206 --> 03:54.664
can be conducted.

03:54.832 --> 03:56.706
I am confident of the outcome.

03:56.876 --> 04:00.410
Timothy, haven't seen you
since the Vulcanian expedition.

04:02.923 --> 04:05.211
Well, I see our graduating

04:05.383 --> 04:07.791
class from the academy
is well represented.

04:07.969 --> 04:09.878
Corrigan. Teller.

04:12.473 --> 04:15.806
- How you doing, Mike?
- I'll get by, Jim.

04:15.976 --> 04:18.762
I understand you're
laying over for repairs.

04:18.937 --> 04:20.266
Big job?

04:20.439 --> 04:22.894
- Couple of days.
- Be moving out then?

04:23.733 --> 04:25.940
- In a hurry to see me go?
- Oh, I just wondered how long

04:26.111 --> 04:27.902
it would take you to get
a new records officer.

04:29.572 --> 04:32.692
- You can talk plainer than that.
- I can.

04:32.867 --> 04:35.073
But I think the point's been made.

04:35.244 --> 04:37.236
- Ben was a friend of ours.
- Come on, Jim, let's go.

04:37.413 --> 04:38.492
No, go on, finish.

04:41.416 --> 04:44.085
Ben was a friend of yours,
and?

04:44.252 --> 04:45.912
Jim.

04:46.087 --> 04:47.415
Go on.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.914
- I'm waiting to hear the rest.
- Why don't you tell us?

04:52.551 --> 04:54.508
What would be the point?

04:55.846 --> 04:57.838
You've already
made up your minds.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.346
Excuse me, Bones.

05:15.114 --> 05:19.111
If you have any doubt, that was indeed
Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise.

05:19.284 --> 05:22.035
Yes, I know.
Are you a friend of his?

05:22.203 --> 05:23.947
In these trying times,
one of the few.

05:25.748 --> 05:27.906
Dr. Leonard McCoy, and you?

05:28.084 --> 05:29.626
Areel Shaw.

05:29.794 --> 05:32.284
And I'm a friend too. An old one.

05:32.713 --> 05:35.382
All of my old friends
look like doctors.

05:35.966 --> 05:37.839
All of his look like you.

05:38.009 --> 05:41.129
Well, you might as well join me for
a drink. With this enquiry coming up,

05:41.304 --> 05:43.676
he's going to need
all the friends he can get.

05:49.103 --> 05:50.680
Recording: Enquiry.

05:50.854 --> 05:52.847
Matter: Captain Kirk, James T.

05:53.023 --> 05:54.814
Subject: Circumstances of death,

05:54.983 --> 05:57.272
Lieutenant Commander Finney,
Benjamin.

05:57.444 --> 06:00.017
This enquiry to determine
whether a general court-martial

06:00.196 --> 06:02.521
should be convened against
Captain Kirk,

06:03.407 --> 06:06.657
on charges of perjury
and culpable negligence.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.579
Ready.

06:10.414 --> 06:13.284
Let's begin with your relationship
with Commander Finney.

06:14.209 --> 06:15.869
You knew him for a long time,
didn't you?

06:16.044 --> 06:18.831
Yes, he was an instructor
at the academy when I was

06:19.005 --> 06:20.962
a midshipman,
but that didn't stand in the way

06:21.132 --> 06:22.792
of our beginning a close friendship.

06:22.967 --> 06:25.802
His daughter Jame, who was here
last night, was named after me.

06:25.970 --> 06:28.923
It's common knowledge that something
happened to your friendship.

06:29.098 --> 06:32.881
It's no secret. We were assigned
to the same ship some years later.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.724
I relieved him on watch once

06:35.895 --> 06:37.888
and found a circuit open
to the atomic matter piles

06:38.064 --> 06:39.855
that should've been closed.

06:40.024 --> 06:42.147
Another five minutes,
could have blown up the ship.

06:42.526 --> 06:45.313
Ship's nomenclature. Specify.

06:46.196 --> 06:49.150
United Starship Republic,
number 1371.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.819
Continue.

06:51.993 --> 06:55.860
I closed the switch
and logged the incident.

06:56.039 --> 06:59.490
He drew a reprimand and was sent
to the bottom of the promotion list.

06:59.667 --> 07:02.418
- And he blamed you for that?
- Yes.

07:03.295 --> 07:05.786
He had been at the academy
for an unusually long time

07:05.964 --> 07:07.044
as an instructor.

07:07.216 --> 07:10.798
As a result, he was late in being
assigned to a starship.

07:10.969 --> 07:12.926
The delay, he felt,
looked bad on his record.

07:13.096 --> 07:14.839
My action, he believed,
made things worse.

07:15.139 --> 07:16.634
Comment.

07:16.891 --> 07:20.057
Service record of Commander
Finney to be appended this enquiry.

07:20.227 --> 07:21.769
Noted.

07:22.229 --> 07:25.100
Now, let's get into the specifics
of the storm, captain.

07:25.274 --> 07:28.808
Weather scan indicated
an ion storm dead ahead.

07:28.985 --> 07:31.903
- I sent Finney into the pod.
- Why Finney?

07:32.072 --> 07:33.981
- He was at the top of the duty roster.
- If he blamed...

07:34.157 --> 07:36.149
He may have blamed me
that he never commanded a ship,

07:36.325 --> 07:38.863
but I don't assign jobs on the basis
of who blames me.

07:39.036 --> 07:41.325
It was Finney's turn,
and I assigned him.

07:42.122 --> 07:44.447
He had just checked in with me...

07:45.083 --> 07:48.250
...from the pod when we hit
the leading edge of the storm.

07:48.837 --> 07:50.710
Not too bad at first.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.501
I signalled a yellow alert.

07:53.675 --> 07:56.426
Then we began encountering
pressure, variance, stress,

07:56.594 --> 07:58.171
force seven, the works.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.883
I finally signalled a red alert.

08:01.932 --> 08:04.387
Finney knew he had
a matter of seconds.

08:05.936 --> 08:08.473
I gave him those seconds
and more.

08:10.899 --> 08:13.436
But, apparently, it wasn't enough.

08:14.777 --> 08:17.268
Then why, captain,
does the computer log from your ship,

08:17.446 --> 08:20.281
made automatically at the time,
indicate that you were still on

08:20.449 --> 08:23.284
yellow alert when you jettisoned,
and not on red?

08:24.953 --> 08:26.530
I don't know.

08:27.872 --> 08:30.078
- There's been a mistake.
- It would seem so.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.243
Could the computer be wrong?

08:32.418 --> 08:34.541
Mr. Spock is running
a survey right now,

08:34.712 --> 08:36.835
but the odds are
next to impossible.

08:38.173 --> 08:40.047
Stop recording.

08:42.135 --> 08:43.794
Now, look, Jim.

08:46.556 --> 08:49.307
Not one man in a million could
do what you and I have done.

08:49.475 --> 08:51.468
Command a starship.

08:52.144 --> 08:54.552
A hundred decisions a day,
hundreds of lives

08:54.730 --> 08:57.221
staked on you making
every one of them right.

08:57.816 --> 08:59.643
You're played out, Jim.

08:59.818 --> 09:01.645
- Exhausted.
- Is that the way you see it?

09:01.820 --> 09:03.812
It's the way my report will read,
if you cooperate.

09:03.989 --> 09:06.906
Physical breakdown.
Possibly even mental collapse?

09:07.075 --> 09:09.363
- Possibly.
- I'd be admitting that a man died...

09:09.535 --> 09:11.278
Admit nothing. Say nothing.

09:12.538 --> 09:14.162
Let me bury the matter
here and now.

09:14.331 --> 09:17.782
No starship captain has ever stood trial
before, and I don't want you to be first.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.415
If what you suspect is true, I'm guilty.
I should be punished.

09:20.837 --> 09:22.960
I'm thinking of the service.

09:23.590 --> 09:27.338
- I won't have it smeared...
- By what, Commodore Stone?

09:28.219 --> 09:29.678
All right.

09:30.137 --> 09:33.173
By an evident perjurer who is either
covering up his bad judgement,

09:33.349 --> 09:36.551
- his cowardice or something worse.
- That's as far as you go, sir.

09:36.727 --> 09:39.052
I'm telling you I was there,
on the bridge.

09:39.229 --> 09:40.688
I know what happened.
I know what I did.

09:40.855 --> 09:44.189
It's in the transcript,
and computer transcripts don't lie.

09:45.818 --> 09:49.401
I'm telling you, either you accept
a permanent ground assignment or...

09:50.406 --> 09:52.398
...the whole disciplinary weight
of Starfleet Command

09:52.574 --> 09:55.148
- will light right on your neck.
- So that's the way we do it now?

09:55.327 --> 09:57.450
Sweep it under the rug
and me along with it.

09:57.621 --> 09:59.779
Not on your life.
I intend to fight.

09:59.956 --> 10:01.783
Then you draw a general court.

10:01.958 --> 10:05.409
Draw it? I demand it. And right now,
Commodore Stone. Right now.

10:16.054 --> 10:19.008
Captain's log, stardate 2948.9.

10:19.557 --> 10:21.846
The officers who will comprise
my court-martial board

10:22.018 --> 10:24.057
are proceeding to Starbase 11.

10:24.228 --> 10:27.229
Meanwhile, repairs on the Enterprise
are almost complete.

10:33.779 --> 10:35.237
Areel.

10:39.742 --> 10:41.901
Dr. McCoy said you were here.

10:42.078 --> 10:45.411
I should have felt it in the air,
like static electricity.

10:45.581 --> 10:47.906
Flattery will get you everywhere.

10:54.297 --> 10:56.040
It's been...

10:56.925 --> 10:58.584
How long has it been?

10:59.010 --> 11:01.927
Four years, seven months
and an odd number of days.

11:02.096 --> 11:04.765
- Not that I'm counting.
- You look marvellous.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.592
You haven't changed a bit.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.759
Things have changed for you,
haven't they?

11:09.353 --> 11:11.428
Oh, you've heard about that,
have you?

11:12.189 --> 11:14.762
I'm a lawyer in the
Judge Advocate's office, remember?

11:14.941 --> 11:17.230
I remember. Let's forget it.

11:17.402 --> 11:19.892
We have a lot of lost time
to make up for.

11:20.946 --> 11:22.773
You're taking it very lightly.

11:22.948 --> 11:25.404
- The confidence of an innocent man.
- Are you?

11:26.118 --> 11:27.778
That's not
what the rumours indicate.

11:28.537 --> 11:31.905
Look, let's not talk shop.

11:32.624 --> 11:35.790
Jim, this could ruin you.
Will you take some advice?

11:35.960 --> 11:38.795
I never could talk you into anything.

11:41.340 --> 11:42.585
All right, fire away.

11:44.093 --> 11:47.212
The prosecution will build its case
on the basis of Kirk

11:47.387 --> 11:48.798
versus the computer.

11:48.972 --> 11:51.379
Now, if your attorney tries
to defend on that basis,

11:51.558 --> 11:53.467
you won't have a chance.

11:53.643 --> 11:55.054
What other choice is there?

11:55.228 --> 11:58.264
Well, that's up to your attorney, and
that's why he's got to be a good one.

11:59.023 --> 12:01.395
- You, perhaps?
- No, I...

12:01.942 --> 12:04.267
- I'm busy.
- Well,

12:04.444 --> 12:07.813
a girl with your ability should be able
to handle two cases at once.

12:07.989 --> 12:09.982
Jim, be serious.

12:10.158 --> 12:13.112
You're not an ordinary human.
You're a starship captain,

12:13.286 --> 12:15.325
and you've stepped into scandal.

12:15.496 --> 12:17.738
If there's any way they can do it,
they'll slap you down

12:17.915 --> 12:21.118
hard and permanently
for the good of the service.

12:22.794 --> 12:24.502
You still haven't made
any recommendations.

12:24.671 --> 12:27.588
Samuel T. Cogley, attorney at law.

12:27.757 --> 12:29.999
If anyone can save you, he can.

12:30.176 --> 12:32.085
He'll be paying you a visit.

12:33.012 --> 12:34.839
- Jim, I've got to go.
- Areel.

12:36.557 --> 12:38.348
You still haven't told me
how you know so much

12:38.517 --> 12:40.510
about what the prosecution's
going to do.

12:42.854 --> 12:46.223
Because, Jim Kirk,
my dear old love...

12:47.942 --> 12:50.231
...I am the prosecution.

12:50.403 --> 12:54.151
And I have to do my very best
to have you slapped down hard,

12:55.032 --> 12:56.989
broken out of the service,

12:57.868 --> 12:59.659
in disgrace.

13:17.678 --> 13:19.053
You Kirk?

13:20.055 --> 13:21.466
Yes.

13:24.309 --> 13:26.100
- What is all this?
- I figured we'd be spending

13:26.269 --> 13:30.218
- some time together, so I moved in.
- I hope I'm not crowding you.

13:30.398 --> 13:31.892
What's the matter,
don't you like books?

13:32.066 --> 13:35.316
Oh, I like them fine,
but a computer takes less space.

13:35.986 --> 13:37.266
A computer, huh?

13:37.446 --> 13:39.438
I got one of these in my office.

13:39.614 --> 13:41.773
Contains all the precedents.

13:42.409 --> 13:46.157
A synthesis of all the great legal
decisions written throughout time.

13:47.205 --> 13:49.162
- I never use it.
- Why not?

13:49.332 --> 13:52.451
I've got my own system.
Books, young man, books.

13:52.626 --> 13:55.746
Thousands of them. If time wasn't
so important, I'd show you something.

13:55.921 --> 13:59.372
- My library. Thousands of books.
- What would be the point?

13:59.549 --> 14:01.091
This is where the law is.

14:01.259 --> 14:04.260
Not in that homogenized,
pasteurized, synthesized...

14:04.929 --> 14:07.336
Do you want to know the law?
The ancient concepts

14:07.515 --> 14:10.136
in their own language?
Learn the intent of the men

14:10.309 --> 14:14.769
who wrote them? From Moses
to the Tribunal of Alpha III?

14:15.564 --> 14:17.272
Books.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.557
You have to be either an obsessive
crackpot who's escaped

14:20.735 --> 14:23.440
from his keeper or Samuel T. Cogley,
attorney at law.

14:23.613 --> 14:26.448
You're right on both counts.
Need a lawyer?

14:26.615 --> 14:27.860
I'm afraid so.

14:35.415 --> 14:37.906
This court is now in session.

14:42.130 --> 14:44.418
I have appointed,
as members of this court...

14:44.882 --> 14:47.799
...Space Command
Representative Lindstrom...

14:48.510 --> 14:52.045
...Starship Captains
Krasnovsky and Chandra.

14:54.307 --> 14:56.798
Captain Kirk, I direct
your attention to the fact

14:56.976 --> 14:59.646
that you have a right to ask
for substitute officers if you feel

14:59.812 --> 15:03.311
that any of these named harbour
prejudiced attitudes to your case.

15:03.482 --> 15:05.060
I have no objection, sir.

15:05.234 --> 15:07.641
And do you consent
to the service of Lieutenant Shaw

15:07.820 --> 15:11.651
as prosecuting officer, and to myself
as president of the court?

15:13.992 --> 15:16.447
- I do, sir.
- All right, clerk.

15:19.956 --> 15:22.114
Charge: Culpable negligence.

15:22.291 --> 15:27.332
Specification:
In that, on stardate 2945.7

15:27.504 --> 15:30.421
by such negligence,
Captain Kirk, James T.

15:30.590 --> 15:34.504
Did cause loss of life to wit,
the life of records officer

15:34.677 --> 15:36.800
Lieutenant Commander Finney,
Benjamin.

15:36.971 --> 15:41.182
To all recorded charges and
specifications, what is the plea?

15:45.521 --> 15:46.801
Not guilty.

15:53.945 --> 15:55.522
Proceed, lieutenant.

15:57.365 --> 15:59.523
I call Mr. Spock.

16:12.170 --> 16:17.709
Spock:
Serial number S 179-276 SP.

16:18.217 --> 16:20.624
Service rank:
Lieutenant commander.

16:20.803 --> 16:24.053
Position:
First officer, science officer.

16:24.222 --> 16:27.556
Current Assignment:
USS Enterprise.

16:27.726 --> 16:31.225
Commendations:
Vulcanian Scientific Legion of Honour.

16:31.646 --> 16:35.939
Awards of valour: Twice decorated
by Starfleet Command.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.603
Mr. Spock, as a first officer
you know a great deal

16:39.778 --> 16:41.403
about computers, don't you?

16:41.572 --> 16:42.852
I know all about them.

16:43.031 --> 16:45.902
It is possible for a computer
to malfunction, is it not?

16:46.076 --> 16:48.282
- Affirmative.
- Do you know of any malfunction

16:48.453 --> 16:51.572
which has caused an inaccuracy
in the Enterprise computer?

16:51.748 --> 16:52.827
Negative.

16:52.999 --> 16:55.121
That answer is based
on your mechanical survey

16:55.292 --> 16:57.368
of the Enterprise computer,
ordered by

16:57.544 --> 16:59.751
the defendant prior to this trial,
is it not?

16:59.922 --> 17:01.499
- Affirmative.
- Now, the stardate...

17:01.673 --> 17:04.876
But the computer is inaccurate,
nevertheless.

17:05.050 --> 17:06.960
Why do you say that?

17:07.137 --> 17:11.050
It reports that the jettison button
was pressed before the red alert.

17:11.223 --> 17:13.430
In other words,
it reports that Captain Kirk

17:13.601 --> 17:17.432
was reacting to an extreme emergency
that did not then exist.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.439
- And that is impossible.
- Is it?

17:20.607 --> 17:22.516
Were you watching him
the exact moment

17:22.692 --> 17:26.108
- he pressed the jettison button?
- No. I was occupied.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.271
The ship was already
on yellow alert.

17:28.448 --> 17:31.448
Then how can you dispute
the finding of the log?

17:31.909 --> 17:34.115
I do not dispute it.

17:34.286 --> 17:37.287
- I merely state that it is wrong.
- Oh?

17:37.456 --> 17:40.456
- On what do you base that statement?
- I know the captain.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.250
- He is in...
- Please instruct the witness

17:42.419 --> 17:45.123
- not to speculate.
- Lieutenant.

17:45.296 --> 17:47.454
I am half Vulcanian.

17:47.632 --> 17:49.589
Vulcanians do not speculate.

17:49.759 --> 17:51.965
I speak from pure logic.

17:52.136 --> 17:55.718
If I let go of a hammer on a planet
that has a positive gravity,

17:55.889 --> 17:59.803
I need not see it fall to know
that it has, in fact, fallen.

17:59.976 --> 18:02.549
- I do not see what that has...
- Gentlemen,

18:02.729 --> 18:07.437
human beings have characteristics
just as inanimate objects do.

18:07.608 --> 18:13.029
It is impossible for Captain Kirk
to act out of panic or malice.

18:13.655 --> 18:16.407
- It is not his nature.
- In your opinion.

18:19.494 --> 18:20.988
Yes.

18:21.329 --> 18:24.164
- In my opinion.
- Thank you.

18:24.332 --> 18:27.167
- Your witness, Mr. Cogley.
- No questions.

18:27.877 --> 18:29.786
You may step down.

18:33.090 --> 18:36.174
I now call the personnel officer
for the Enterprise.

18:37.719 --> 18:39.427
Service rank: Ensign.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.672
Position: Personnel officer.

18:41.848 --> 18:44.967
Current assignment:
USS Enterprise.

18:45.142 --> 18:48.593
In the course of your duties as
personnel officer of the Enterprise,

18:48.771 --> 18:51.641
you would be familiar
with the service records of all aboard?

18:52.149 --> 18:53.857
- Yes, ma'am.
- With reference

18:54.025 --> 18:58.023
to Records Officer Finney,
was there, in his service record,

18:58.196 --> 19:01.565
a report of disciplinary action
for failure to close a circuit?

19:01.741 --> 19:04.148
- Yes, ma'am.
- Was the charge, in that instance,

19:04.327 --> 19:07.695
based upon a log entry
by the officer who relieved him?

19:07.871 --> 19:10.445
- Yes, ma'am.
- And who was that officer?

19:12.709 --> 19:14.536
Ensign James T. Kirk.

19:14.711 --> 19:17.036
Louder, please, for the court.

19:17.213 --> 19:19.336
Ensign James T. Kirk.

19:19.507 --> 19:22.176
Now the Captain Kirk
who sits in this courtroom?

19:26.055 --> 19:28.177
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

19:28.348 --> 19:30.970
Do you wish to cross-examine,
Mr. Cogley?

19:31.143 --> 19:33.468
- No questions.
- You may step down.

19:41.027 --> 19:43.564
I now call Dr. McCoy to the stand.

19:45.239 --> 19:47.527
Service rank:
Lieutenant commander.

19:47.699 --> 19:49.573
Position: Ship's surgeon.

19:49.743 --> 19:52.862
Current assignment:
USS Enterprise.

19:53.038 --> 19:55.077
Commendation: Legion of Honour.

19:55.248 --> 19:59.115
Awards of valour:
Decorated by Starfleet Surgeons.

19:59.710 --> 20:02.913
Doctor, you are, on the record,
an expert in psychology,

20:03.088 --> 20:05.662
especially space psychology patterns
which develop

20:05.841 --> 20:08.758
in the close quarters of a ship
during long voyages in deep space.

20:10.136 --> 20:11.761
I know something about it.

20:11.930 --> 20:15.595
You have just heard the testimony
of your own personnel officer

20:15.767 --> 20:18.933
that it was an action
of the then Ensign Kirk

20:19.103 --> 20:21.261
which placed an un-erasable
blot on the record

20:21.438 --> 20:25.305
of the then Lieutenant Finney.
Psychologically, doctor,

20:25.484 --> 20:28.769
is it possible that Lieutenant Finney
blamed Kirk for the incident?

20:29.738 --> 20:31.113
It's possible.

20:31.281 --> 20:33.985
He could have hated Kirk,
down through the years,

20:34.158 --> 20:36.945
blamed him for being
passed over for promotion,

20:37.119 --> 20:40.784
blamed him for never being given
a command of his own, correct?

20:40.956 --> 20:44.455
- He could have.
- Now, let us hypothesize, doctor.

20:44.626 --> 20:47.793
Is it normal for a person
to return affection for hatred?

20:47.963 --> 20:50.632
- No.
- Do we not tend to, at first, resent,

20:50.798 --> 20:53.633
and then actively dislike
the person who hates us?

20:53.801 --> 20:55.592
Wait a minute,
I don't quite follow you.

20:55.761 --> 20:57.469
Hypothetically,

20:57.638 --> 21:02.098
would not Captain Smith begin to hate
Lieutenant Commander Jones

21:02.267 --> 21:04.639
once he learned that
Lieutenant Commander Jones

21:04.811 --> 21:07.219
hated and detested him?

21:07.397 --> 21:10.812
- Oh, yes, I suppose it could happen.
- Then I ask you,

21:10.983 --> 21:13.653
is it not possible that
Captain Kirk became aware

21:13.819 --> 21:16.191
of Lieutenant Commander
Finney's hatred toward him,

21:16.363 --> 21:20.313
and perhaps, even involuntarily,
began to reciprocate?

21:20.492 --> 21:23.659
- Not Captain Kirk.
- Any normal human, doctor.

21:23.828 --> 21:26.782
- Is it possible?
- But he's not that kind of a man.

21:26.956 --> 21:29.245
Is it theoretically possible, doctor?

21:31.043 --> 21:32.585
Yes.

21:32.753 --> 21:34.413
It's possible.

21:34.588 --> 21:35.963
Thank you.

21:36.131 --> 21:38.338
Your witness, Mr. Cogley.

21:38.509 --> 21:40.051
No questions.

21:41.178 --> 21:43.051
You may step down.

21:47.350 --> 21:48.844
Mr. Cogley,

21:49.185 --> 21:51.676
you have listened to testimony
from three witnesses,

21:51.854 --> 21:53.728
and in neither instance
have you availed yourself

21:53.898 --> 21:56.186
of your right to cross-examine.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.397
Have you abrogated that right?

21:59.277 --> 22:02.480
Well, sir, the truth is, I've been
holding back till we get this

22:02.655 --> 22:06.320
preliminary business out of the way.
I'd like to call Captain Kirk to the stand.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.151
James T. Kirk.

22:11.330 --> 22:17.284
Serial number SC 937-0176 CEC.

22:17.461 --> 22:21.209
Service rank: Captain.
Position: Starship command.

22:21.381 --> 22:24.335
Current assignment:
USS Enterprise.

22:24.509 --> 22:28.043
Commendations:
Palm Leaf of Axanar Peace Mission,

22:28.220 --> 22:31.969
Grankite Order of Tactics,
Class of Excellence.

22:32.141 --> 22:35.675
Prentares Ribbon of Commendation,
Classes First and Second...

22:35.852 --> 22:37.263
May it please the court.

22:37.437 --> 22:39.394
Court recognises counsel
for the prosecution.

22:39.564 --> 22:43.478
The prosecution concedes the
inestimable record of Captain Kirk.

22:44.610 --> 22:46.354
- Mr. Cogley?
- I wouldn't want to slow

22:46.529 --> 22:47.560
the wheels of progress.

22:48.197 --> 22:50.320
But then, on the other hand,

22:50.491 --> 22:53.195
I wouldn't want those wheels
to run over my client

22:53.368 --> 22:55.574
in their unbridled haste.

22:58.915 --> 23:00.706
Continue.

23:00.875 --> 23:05.335
Awards of valour: Medal of Honour,
Silver Palm with Cluster,

23:05.504 --> 23:09.039
Starfleet Citation for
Conspicuous Gallantry,

23:09.216 --> 23:11.422
- Karagite Order of...
- Stop.

23:11.593 --> 23:13.502
I think that's enough.

23:13.678 --> 23:15.754
I wouldn't wanna slow
things up too much.

23:15.931 --> 23:17.425
Thank you.

23:17.974 --> 23:21.259
Now, captain, despite what
these machines indicate,

23:21.436 --> 23:25.764
was there indeed a red alert
before you jettisoned the pod?

23:25.940 --> 23:27.185
Yes, sir, there was.

23:28.442 --> 23:30.185
Please tell us about it.

23:32.237 --> 23:34.942
Firstly, I am at a loss
to explain the errors

23:35.115 --> 23:37.902
in the extract
from the computer log.

23:38.076 --> 23:40.198
We were in an ion storm.

23:40.703 --> 23:43.953
Everyone here in this court
knows the dangers involved.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.996
I was in command.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.576
The decisions were mine,
no one else's.

23:49.461 --> 23:53.624
Charges of malice have been raised.
There was no malice.

23:54.174 --> 23:57.091
Lieutenant Commander Finney
was a member of my crew,

23:57.260 --> 23:59.798
and that's exactly
the way he was treated.

24:00.554 --> 24:03.674
It has been suggested that
I panicked on the bridge

24:04.308 --> 24:08.388
and jettisoned the ion pod prematurely.
That is not so.

24:09.855 --> 24:12.642
You have heard some
of the details of my record.

24:12.816 --> 24:15.306
This was not my first crisis.

24:15.485 --> 24:17.145
It was one of many.

24:17.320 --> 24:22.693
During it, I did what my experience
and training required me to do.

24:23.325 --> 24:26.112
I took the proper steps
in the proper order.

24:26.286 --> 24:28.777
I did exactly what had to be done,

24:28.955 --> 24:30.995
exactly when it should have
been done.

24:31.166 --> 24:35.163
You did the right thing,
but would you do it again?

24:38.172 --> 24:40.497
Given the same circumstances...

24:41.675 --> 24:44.510
...I would do the same thing
without hesitation.

24:45.304 --> 24:47.343
Because the steps I took,

24:47.514 --> 24:49.506
in the order I took them,

24:50.266 --> 24:53.801
were absolutely necessary
if I were to save my ship.

24:55.521 --> 24:57.181
And nothing

24:57.857 --> 25:00.312
is more important
than my ship.

25:07.782 --> 25:09.360
Your witness, Miss Shaw.

25:14.497 --> 25:17.700
The prosecution does not
wish to dishonour this man,

25:17.875 --> 25:19.333
but facts are facts.

25:19.501 --> 25:23.202
I must invite the attention
of the court and Captain Kirk

25:23.380 --> 25:26.546
to this visual extract
from the Enterprise computer log.

25:27.300 --> 25:28.878
Playback.

25:32.722 --> 25:35.972
What you are about to see
is precisely what took place

25:36.141 --> 25:39.557
on the Enterprise bridge
during the ion storm.

25:44.649 --> 25:47.187
Meteorology reports ion storm
upcoming, captain.

25:47.360 --> 25:49.566
We'll need somebody
in the pod for readings, Mr. Spock.

25:49.737 --> 25:52.489
- Mr. Finney is top of duty roster.
- Post him.

25:52.656 --> 25:55.527
- Lieutenant.
- Attention, Commander Finney.

25:55.701 --> 25:57.989
Report to pod for reading
on ion plates.

25:58.161 --> 26:01.328
- Message received.
- Officer posted, captain.

26:06.419 --> 26:09.622
- Stand by on alert status, Mr. Spock.
- Acknowledged.

26:09.797 --> 26:12.252
Approaching ion storm, sir.

26:12.967 --> 26:16.252
- Warp factor 1, Mr. Hansen.
- Warp 1, sir.

26:21.558 --> 26:23.182
Reverse.

26:28.272 --> 26:29.766
Stop.

26:30.441 --> 26:33.311
Go forward with magnification
on the panel.

26:33.485 --> 26:35.359
Gravity control
switching to batteries.

26:37.239 --> 26:38.697
Freeze that.

26:41.201 --> 26:44.534
Captain Kirk is now signalling
a yellow alert.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.447
Go forward, normal view.

26:48.874 --> 26:51.709
- Call from the pod, sir.
- Tie in.

26:52.044 --> 26:54.332
Finney here, captain.
Ion readings in progress.

26:54.504 --> 26:56.580
Make it fast, Ben.
I may have to go to red alert.

26:56.756 --> 26:58.215
Affirmative.

27:00.927 --> 27:03.500
- Hold your course, Mr. Hansen.
- Aye, aye, sir.

27:06.724 --> 27:09.215
Lateral vibrations,
force two, captain.

27:11.937 --> 27:14.309
- Force three.
- Engineering, then ion pod.

27:14.481 --> 27:15.809
Aye, aye, sir.

27:15.982 --> 27:18.105
- Engineering.
- One-third more thrust.

27:18.276 --> 27:19.854
Working.

27:20.653 --> 27:21.982
Ion pod.

27:22.155 --> 27:25.321
- Stand by to get out of there, Ben.
- Aye, aye, sir.

27:26.534 --> 27:27.778
Force five, sir.

27:27.952 --> 27:30.277
Steady as she goes, Mr. Hansen.

27:30.454 --> 27:31.782
Freeze that.

27:37.794 --> 27:42.040
If the court will notice, the log plainly
shows the defendant's finger

27:42.215 --> 27:44.006
pressing the jettison button.

27:44.175 --> 27:48.219
The condition signal reads
yellow alert, not red alert,

27:48.387 --> 27:50.260
but simply yellow alert.

27:50.430 --> 27:53.846
When the pod containing Lieutenant
Commander Finney was jettisoned,

27:54.017 --> 27:56.590
the emergency did not as yet exist.

28:07.529 --> 28:09.652
But that's not the way it happened.

28:14.577 --> 28:17.993
Captain's log, stardate 2949.9.

28:18.164 --> 28:21.698
The evidence presented by the visual
playback to my general court-martial

28:21.876 --> 28:26.502
was damning. I suspect even
my attorney has begun to doubt me.

28:26.672 --> 28:29.589
- Computers don't lie.
- Are you suggesting that I did?

28:30.050 --> 28:32.375
I'm suggesting that maybe
you did have a lapse.

28:32.552 --> 28:35.636
It was possible, you know,
with the strain you were under.

28:35.805 --> 28:39.221
There's still time to change our plea.
I could get you off.

28:42.853 --> 28:45.260
Two days ago, I'd have
staked anything on my judgement.

28:45.439 --> 28:49.388
- You did. Your professional career.
- I spent my whole life training

28:49.567 --> 28:51.893
for decisions just like that one.

28:53.237 --> 28:54.862
My whole life.

28:57.408 --> 29:00.278
Is it possible that when
the moment came?

29:03.539 --> 29:05.081
No.

29:05.332 --> 29:06.707
I know what I did.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.998
You can pull out if you want to.

29:09.169 --> 29:11.624
There's no place to go,
except back to court

29:11.796 --> 29:12.959
and hear the verdict.

29:15.883 --> 29:17.508
- Kirk here.
- Captain.

29:17.676 --> 29:20.048
I have run a complete megalite
survey on the computer.

29:20.220 --> 29:22.047
I'll tell you what you found.
Nothing, right?

29:23.265 --> 29:24.675
You sound bitter, captain.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.056
Not bitter enough to forget
to thank you for your efforts.

29:28.353 --> 29:30.429
- Further instructions?
- No.

29:31.189 --> 29:33.228
It's not all bad, Mr. Spock.

29:33.399 --> 29:36.104
Who knows? You may be able
to beat your next captain at chess.

29:36.277 --> 29:37.522
Kirk, out.

29:44.868 --> 29:46.445
Chess.

29:49.122 --> 29:50.699
Jame.

29:50.873 --> 29:52.700
- This is Finney's daughter.
- Miss Finney.

29:52.875 --> 29:54.784
Mr. Cogley, you've got to stop this.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.332
Make him take a
ground assignment.

29:57.504 --> 30:01.122
I realise it wasn't his fault.
I won't make any trouble.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.707
- Make him change his plea.
- It's too late for that, Jame.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.174
But I'm glad you don't blame me
anymore for what happened.

30:06.346 --> 30:08.967
I was just so upset that night.
I'm sorry.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.631
- Don't say anymore.
- But I have to.

30:12.268 --> 30:14.640
I never realised how close
you and Dad had been

30:14.812 --> 30:17.137
until I read through some
of the papers he wrote.

30:17.314 --> 30:19.188
Letters to Mother and me.

30:20.525 --> 30:23.976
I don't know how I ever
could have thought that you...

30:24.154 --> 30:28.483
Mr. Cogley, ruining Jim won't
change what's happened.

30:28.658 --> 30:32.026
That's very commendable,
Miss Finney, but most unusual.

30:32.203 --> 30:35.951
After all, Captain Kirk is accused
of causing your father's death.

30:36.123 --> 30:38.162
And the evidence
would indicate his guilt.

30:38.333 --> 30:41.951
- I was just thinking of Jim.
- I know, and I thank you.

30:43.129 --> 30:44.956
I have to go and change.
You ready?

30:45.131 --> 30:46.590
No,

30:46.841 --> 30:49.676
but I may be getting ready.

30:52.554 --> 30:55.128
Bishop, half level right.

30:56.141 --> 30:59.011
- Well, I had to see it to believe it.
- Explain.

30:59.185 --> 31:01.178
They're gonna lop off the
captain's professional head,

31:01.354 --> 31:03.347
and you're sitting here playing
chess with a computer.

31:03.523 --> 31:05.183
That is true.

31:05.358 --> 31:08.027
Mr. Spock, you're the most
cold-blooded man I've ever known.

31:09.320 --> 31:10.518
Why, thank you, doctor.

31:11.613 --> 31:14.187
I've just won my fourth game.

31:14.992 --> 31:17.909
- That's impossible.
- Observe for yourself.

31:18.078 --> 31:20.403
Rook to king's pawn four.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.822
Bishop, half level right.

31:22.999 --> 31:25.537
Now, this is the computer's move.

31:27.044 --> 31:29.083
And now mine.

31:32.674 --> 31:34.382
Checkmate.

31:36.511 --> 31:38.634
Mechanically,
the computer is flawless.

31:38.805 --> 31:42.470
Therefore, logically, its report
of the captain's guilt is infallible.

31:42.642 --> 31:46.306
- I could not accept that, however.
- So you tested the programme bank.

31:46.478 --> 31:49.930
Exactly. I programmed it myself
for chess some months ago.

31:50.107 --> 31:53.061
The best I should have been
able to obtain was a draw.

31:53.610 --> 31:55.982
Well, why are you just sitting there?

31:56.154 --> 31:58.775
Transporter Room, stand by.
We're beaming down.

32:11.418 --> 32:13.327
Court is now in session.

32:18.257 --> 32:21.258
The board will entertain motions
before delivering its verdict.

32:21.427 --> 32:23.419
Counsel for the prosecution?

32:23.971 --> 32:26.426
Sir, the prosecution rests.

32:27.015 --> 32:29.091
Counsel for the defence?

32:30.811 --> 32:32.470
Sir...

32:35.773 --> 32:37.849
...the defence rests.

32:42.112 --> 32:43.772
Mr. Cogley.

32:44.948 --> 32:47.866
- Mr. Cogley.
- Sir.

32:48.035 --> 32:50.608
Some new evidence has just been
brought to my attention,

32:50.787 --> 32:53.076
- and I'd like to ask the court to...
- Objection.

32:53.248 --> 32:55.703
Counsel for the defence
has rested his case.

32:55.875 --> 32:58.247
- Of what nature is this evidence?
- I can't tell you.

32:58.419 --> 33:00.577
- I have to show you, sir.
- Mr. Cogley is well-known

33:00.754 --> 33:02.379
for his theatrics.

33:02.548 --> 33:05.299
Is saving an innocent
man's career a theatric?

33:05.467 --> 33:08.219
Counsels will kindly direct
their remarks to the bench.

33:08.386 --> 33:13.131
I'd be delighted to, sir, now that I've got
something human to talk about.

33:13.766 --> 33:17.100
Rights, sir, human rights.
The Bible.

33:17.269 --> 33:20.804
The Code of Hammurabi
and of Justinian.

33:20.981 --> 33:24.646
Magna Carta.
The Constitution of the United States.

33:24.818 --> 33:27.653
Fundamental Declarations
of the Martian Colonies.

33:27.821 --> 33:29.612
The Statutes of Alpha III.

33:30.949 --> 33:32.324
Gentlemen...

33:32.992 --> 33:35.744
...these documents
all speak of rights.

33:35.911 --> 33:38.995
Rights of the accused
to a trial by his peers.

33:39.164 --> 33:41.157
To be represented by counsel.

33:41.333 --> 33:45.662
The rights of cross-examination.
But most importantly,

33:45.837 --> 33:49.787
the right to be confronted
by the witnesses against him.

33:49.966 --> 33:52.254
A right to which my client
has been denied.

33:52.426 --> 33:55.000
Your Honour, that is ridiculous.
We produced the witnesses

33:55.179 --> 33:58.595
in court. My learned opponent
had the opportunity to see them,

33:58.766 --> 34:01.091
- cross-examine them...
- All but one.

34:01.268 --> 34:05.597
The most devastating witness
against my client is not a human being.

34:05.772 --> 34:07.681
It's a machine.

34:07.857 --> 34:11.273
An information system.
The computer log of the Enterprise.

34:11.444 --> 34:14.777
And I ask this court adjourn
and reconvene aboard that vessel.

34:14.947 --> 34:18.860
- I protest, Your Honour.
- And I repeat. I speak of rights.

34:19.034 --> 34:22.319
A machine has none. A man must.

34:22.495 --> 34:25.496
My client has the right
to face his accuser.

34:25.665 --> 34:28.333
And if you do not grant him
that right,

34:28.501 --> 34:31.039
you have brought us down
to the level of the machine.

34:31.212 --> 34:34.378
Indeed, you have elevated
that machine above us.

34:35.799 --> 34:38.290
I ask that my motion be granted.

34:38.467 --> 34:40.212
And more than that, gentlemen.

34:40.387 --> 34:44.965
In the name of a humanity fading
in the shadow of the machine,

34:45.141 --> 34:48.058
I demand it. I demand it.

34:55.650 --> 34:59.185
Captain's log, stardate 2950.1.

34:59.362 --> 35:03.063
After due consideration, the general
court-martial has reconvened

35:03.241 --> 35:04.439
onboard the Enterprise.

35:04.617 --> 35:08.401
How many games of chess did you
win from the computer, Mr. Spock?

35:08.579 --> 35:10.322
Five in all.

35:10.498 --> 35:12.823
- May that be considered unusual?
- Affirmative.

35:13.667 --> 35:14.995
Why?

35:15.168 --> 35:18.371
I personally programmed the
computer for chess months ago.

35:18.546 --> 35:22.129
I gave the machine an understanding
of the game equal to my own.

35:22.634 --> 35:27.758
The computer cannot make an error,
and assuming that I do not either,

35:27.930 --> 35:30.551
the best that could normally
be hoped for would be stalemate

35:30.724 --> 35:32.349
after stalemate.

35:32.518 --> 35:35.222
And yet
I beat the machine five times.

35:35.395 --> 35:39.475
Someone, either accidentally
or deliberately,

35:39.649 --> 35:41.938
adjusted the programming,
and therefore,

35:42.110 --> 35:44.102
the memory banks of that computer.

35:45.946 --> 35:50.442
Could that have had an effect
on the visual playback we saw?

35:50.617 --> 35:54.745
Object. The witness
would be making a conclusion.

35:54.913 --> 35:58.032
- Sustained.
- Hypothetically, Mr. Spock.

35:58.208 --> 36:00.414
Hypothetically, Miss Shaw.

36:00.585 --> 36:03.455
If what you suggest
had been done,

36:03.629 --> 36:06.202
it would be beyond the
capabilities of most men.

36:06.382 --> 36:08.623
- Is that true?
- Affirmative.

36:08.801 --> 36:12.418
What man aboard ship
would it not be beyond?

36:12.596 --> 36:14.387
The captain, myself

36:14.556 --> 36:16.797
and the records officer.

36:16.975 --> 36:19.975
And at the moment,
you have no records officer.

36:20.144 --> 36:23.228
Affirmative. Until he was lost,
our records officer

36:23.397 --> 36:25.105
was Lieutenant Commander Finney.

36:26.108 --> 36:27.768
Captain Kirk,

36:27.943 --> 36:32.605
will you tell the steps you took
to find Mr. Finney after the storm?

36:32.781 --> 36:34.572
I instituted a Phase 1 Search.

36:34.908 --> 36:37.315
Describe a Phase 1 Search.

36:37.493 --> 36:40.827
It's a painstaking, thorough attempt,
in and around the ship,

36:40.997 --> 36:43.783
to find a man who is presumably
injured and unable to respond.

36:43.958 --> 36:48.169
It presupposes, does it not,
that a man wishes to be found?

36:48.628 --> 36:51.997
- I beg your pardon?
- If you start a search for a man,

36:52.173 --> 36:55.838
you assume, don't you, that he
wants to be found? He's not hiding.

36:56.010 --> 36:57.338
Yes.

36:57.845 --> 37:01.843
On a ship of this size,
could a man evade such a search?

37:05.227 --> 37:06.472
Possibly.

37:08.605 --> 37:10.147
Gentlemen,

37:10.315 --> 37:15.439
I submit to you that Lieutenant
Commander Ben Finney is not dead.

37:16.362 --> 37:19.114
Mr. Cogley, we are waiting for
proof of the extraordinary statement

37:19.281 --> 37:21.606
- you made in the briefing room.
- And you shall have it.

37:21.784 --> 37:25.532
But first I need the cooperation of this
court in conducting an experiment.

37:25.829 --> 37:27.204
- Captain Kirk.
- Gentlemen.

37:27.831 --> 37:31.034
For the purposes of this experiment,
it will be necessary for all personnel,

37:31.209 --> 37:33.534
except for members of the court
and the command crew,

37:33.711 --> 37:36.463
to leave the ship. I am ordering
all others to report

37:36.630 --> 37:38.789
- to the Transporter Room.
- Including myself, sir.

37:38.966 --> 37:40.923
This court is by no means adjourned,
Mr. Cogley.

37:41.093 --> 37:42.966
I have an errand ashore
of vital importance

37:43.136 --> 37:45.841
to the purpose of this court,
and I will return.

37:46.014 --> 37:48.386
- Very well.
- Thank you, sir.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.717
Captain, are you maintaining
an engine crew aboard?

37:50.893 --> 37:52.352
Our impulse engines
have been shut down.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.889
- We'll maintain orbit by momentum.
- And when the orbit begins to decay?

37:56.065 --> 37:58.390
We hope to be finished
long before then.

38:07.492 --> 38:10.409
- Ready, Mr. Spock?
- Affirmative, captain.

38:10.912 --> 38:13.485
Gentlemen, this computer
has an auditory sensor.

38:13.664 --> 38:16.036
It can, in effect, hear sounds.

38:16.208 --> 38:18.616
By installing a booster,
we can increase that capability

38:18.794 --> 38:21.367
on the order of one
to the fourth power.

38:21.546 --> 38:26.541
The computer should be able to bring
us every sound occurring on the ship.

38:26.718 --> 38:29.718
All personnel have left
the ship as ordered, sir.

38:29.887 --> 38:31.595
Dr. McCoy?

38:32.515 --> 38:34.424
All right, Mr. Spock.

38:46.653 --> 38:48.277
Turn it down a little.

38:55.702 --> 38:58.110
Gentlemen, that sound
is caused by the heartbeats

38:58.288 --> 39:00.744
of all the people onboard the ship.

39:01.583 --> 39:03.871
Dr. McCoy

39:04.043 --> 39:08.456
will use this white-sound device
to mask out each person's

39:08.631 --> 39:11.632
heartbeat so that it will be eliminated
from the sounds we are hearing.

39:12.259 --> 39:14.133
First, the captain.

39:17.347 --> 39:19.138
Mr. Spock.

39:38.325 --> 39:40.400
And lastly, myself.

39:43.287 --> 39:46.490
That's all of us, except the crewman
in the Transporter Room.

39:46.666 --> 39:48.954
Mr. Spock, eliminate his heartbeat.

39:51.670 --> 39:53.662
That accounts for everyone.

40:19.028 --> 40:20.273
Finney.

40:25.201 --> 40:26.944
Localise that.

40:31.915 --> 40:35.533
B Deck. In or near Engineering.

40:35.710 --> 40:38.415
Seal off B Deck,
sections 18-Y through 23-D.

40:38.588 --> 40:40.046
Acknowledged.

40:49.806 --> 40:53.140
- So Finney is alive.
- It would seem so.

40:53.643 --> 40:56.513
Commodore, this is my problem.
I would appreciate it if no one

40:56.688 --> 40:58.395
left the bridge.

41:00.316 --> 41:03.103
Sam Cogley had gone ashore
to bring Jame Finney onboard.

41:03.277 --> 41:06.231
We both felt that Jame's presence
would make Finney easier to handle

41:06.405 --> 41:08.563
in the event
Finney really were alive.

41:08.740 --> 41:10.234
Ben.

41:12.619 --> 41:14.362
Ben Finney.

41:20.668 --> 41:22.660
Mr. Spock, encountering variance.

41:22.836 --> 41:24.378
- Compensate.
- What does that mean?

41:24.546 --> 41:26.040
The orbit is beginning to decay.

41:28.592 --> 41:30.465
Ben, where are you?

41:43.188 --> 41:45.394
Hello, captain.

41:46.900 --> 41:49.355
Nothing to say, captain?

41:53.114 --> 41:54.941
I'm glad you're alive.

41:55.116 --> 41:59.362
You mean you're relieved because
you think your career is saved.

41:59.536 --> 42:01.161
Well, you're wrong.

42:09.295 --> 42:10.837
Ben.

42:12.799 --> 42:15.289
Ben, it's not too late.
We can help you.

42:15.468 --> 42:18.137
Like you helped me all along?
Kept me down.

42:18.304 --> 42:20.130
Robbed me of my own command.

42:20.931 --> 42:23.682
I'm a good officer.
As good as you.

42:24.267 --> 42:26.556
I've watched you for years.

42:26.728 --> 42:29.728
The great Captain Kirk.

42:34.902 --> 42:37.571
They told you to do it to me.

42:37.738 --> 42:40.941
You all conspired against me.
You ruined me.

42:41.116 --> 42:43.785
But you won't do it anymore.

42:53.377 --> 42:58.122
- Put the phaser down, Ben.
- Oh, I wouldn't kill you, captain.

42:58.298 --> 43:01.169
Your own death would
mean too little to you.

43:01.343 --> 43:03.916
- But your ship...
- What about my ship?

43:04.095 --> 43:06.668
It's dead. I've killed it.

43:06.848 --> 43:09.173
I tapped out your primary
energy circuits.

43:13.896 --> 43:15.972
Mr. Spock. What's our orbit status?

43:17.024 --> 43:19.016
- Decaying, captain.
- Variance at second level

43:19.192 --> 43:21.350
depreciating unusually fast.

43:21.903 --> 43:25.188
You're out of power.
I know this ship too.

43:25.365 --> 43:28.365
The Enterprise should've been mine.
You kept me from it.

43:29.910 --> 43:31.321
Ben.

43:33.580 --> 43:36.581
- Why kill innocent people?
- Innocent?

43:38.335 --> 43:42.379
Officers and gentlemen,
captains all.

43:43.089 --> 43:47.466
Except for Finney,
and his one mistake

43:47.635 --> 43:50.801
a long time ago,
but they don't forget.

43:50.971 --> 43:53.379
I logged the mistake, Ben.
Blame me, not them.

43:53.557 --> 43:55.845
But they are to blame.
All of them.

43:57.561 --> 44:00.230
I was a good officer.

44:01.064 --> 44:03.021
I really was.

44:03.774 --> 44:07.060
I loved the service more
than any man ever dared.

44:07.236 --> 44:10.237
Mr. Spock,
we're running out of time.

44:10.406 --> 44:12.731
Gentlemen, if you'll please hurry
to the Transporter Room.

44:12.908 --> 44:15.992
Mr. Spock, the court has
not yet reached a verdict.

44:16.161 --> 44:19.446
- We will hear this witness out.
- Very well, sir.

44:21.582 --> 44:25.200
It's not too late.
You can be helped.

44:25.419 --> 44:28.503
- But if you kill all those people...
- Why shouldn't I?

44:29.131 --> 44:31.254
They killed me, didn't they?

44:31.800 --> 44:33.958
It's a fair trade.

44:34.427 --> 44:36.254
Is Jame included in that deal?

44:38.181 --> 44:39.379
What do you mean?

44:39.974 --> 44:41.883
She's onboard by now.

44:42.935 --> 44:47.015
- Yes, she's onboard.
- Why did you do that?

44:47.189 --> 44:49.478
Why did you bring her here?

45:40.946 --> 45:43.900
Beaten and sobbing, Finney told me
where he had sabotaged

45:44.074 --> 45:46.482
the prime energy circuits.
The damage he had caused

45:46.660 --> 45:48.736
was considerable,
but not irreparable.

45:48.912 --> 45:52.115
With luck, I would be able to effect
repairs before our orbit

45:52.290 --> 45:54.448
decayed completely.

46:27.739 --> 46:30.858
Power returning, Mr. Spock.
Up 14 points and rising.

46:31.034 --> 46:33.156
Activate port impulse engines.

46:33.327 --> 46:35.735
- One-third power.
- One-third power.

46:42.711 --> 46:44.703
Variance fading.

46:53.179 --> 46:54.803
Orbit stabilising.

47:08.276 --> 47:10.185
All secure, sir.

47:16.033 --> 47:18.903
Unless the prosecution
has an objection,

47:19.077 --> 47:21.449
I rule this court be dismissed.

47:21.621 --> 47:24.373
Absolutely no objection, sir.

47:43.766 --> 47:46.767
How long will it be this time
before I see you again?

47:46.936 --> 47:50.933
At the risk of sounding like a mystic,
that depends on the stars.

47:51.815 --> 47:54.686
Sam Cogley asked me
to give you something special.

47:54.860 --> 47:57.944
It's not a first edition
or anything, just a book.

47:58.113 --> 47:59.773
Sam says that makes
it special though.

48:00.615 --> 48:02.406
I didn't have much of
a chance to thank him.

48:02.575 --> 48:04.235
He's busy on a case.

48:04.410 --> 48:06.284
He's defending Ben Finney.

48:07.455 --> 48:10.076
- He says he'll win.
- I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

48:11.959 --> 48:15.125
Do you think it would cause
a complete breakdown of discipline

48:15.295 --> 48:20.336
if a lowly lieutenant kissed a starship
captain on the bridge of his ship?

48:21.718 --> 48:23.461
Let's try.

48:32.978 --> 48:36.062
See, no change.
Discipline goes on.

48:36.231 --> 48:37.891
And so must the Enterprise.

48:38.483 --> 48:40.226
Goodbye, Jim.

48:40.818 --> 48:42.443
Goodbye, Areel.

48:42.987 --> 48:44.315
Better luck next time.

48:45.448 --> 48:48.816
I had pretty good luck this time.
I lost, didn't I?

49:09.469 --> 49:11.509
She's a very good lawyer.

49:11.721 --> 49:14.841
- Obviously.
- Indeed, she is.
