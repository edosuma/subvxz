09:55.700 --> 09:56.834
I just wanted to let you know

09:56.834 --> 09:58.233
that I'm your biggest fan,

09:58.233 --> 10:00.200
and if wouldn't mind
hooking a sister up with

10:00.200 --> 10:01.567
a autograph
and a few pictures.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.100
Here, sign right
here next to Earl.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.200
What is this?

10:04.200 --> 10:05.967
Carl, back in your
shell right now, Zen.

10:07.033 --> 10:08.800
Nothing, girl, just smile
big for the camera.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.834
But... ow!

10:10.500 --> 10:12.300
What are you doing?

10:12.300 --> 10:13.300
I have sensitive retinas.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.367
Will you get here out of here?

10:14.367 --> 10:15.300
No, stop!

10:15.300 --> 10:16.200
Bad turtles!

10:16.200 --> 10:17.400
Look, free protein shake!

10:19.600 --> 10:20.800
Oh, my Truffles.

10:20.800 --> 10:21.900
Truffles,

10:21.900 --> 10:24.600
Truffles,
baby, you okay?

10:24.600 --> 10:27.367
She dognapped my baby!

10:27.367 --> 10:28.767
Will you get that girl?!

10:28.767 --> 10:30.200
I want her arrested!

10:31.867 --> 10:32.867
Whew!

10:32.867 --> 10:34.233
Glad that's over with.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.567
GUARD:
There she is!

10:35.567 --> 10:37.100
Swarm! Swarm!
Swarm!

10:46.867 --> 10:48.700
Serenity.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.600
Mom, big problem.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.000
Serenity over.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.934
You are not going
to believe what
just happened.

10:54.934 --> 10:56.000
Oh, I heard.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.300
Somebody stole Myesha's dog

10:57.300 --> 10:58.700
and now she wants
to have the woman arrested.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.100
Well, I don't blame her.

11:00.100 --> 11:03.200
What kind of creep would steal
poor little ol' Truffles.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.300
He's harmless.

11:04.300 --> 11:05.500
(<i>dog barks </i>)

11:10.400 --> 11:12.967
Oh, snap! I'm the creep!

11:14.200 --> 11:15.600
Raven, you stole the dog?!

11:15.600 --> 11:17.867
No, Mom, it must have jumped
into my bag when I was

11:17.867 --> 11:19.500
pretending to be
her yoga teacher.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.500
What?!

11:20.500 --> 11:21.467
(<i>knocking </i>)

11:21.467 --> 11:23.000
CARL:
Is anyone in there?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.367
We're doing a search
of the area.

11:24.367 --> 11:25.600
Just a minute.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.300
Rae, just give them
back the dog

11:27.300 --> 11:28.734
and explain what happened.

11:28.734 --> 11:29.900
Uh, Mom, you remember

11:29.900 --> 11:32.000
when you tried
to touch Truffles.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.934
These people swarm first
and ask questions later.

11:34.934 --> 11:36.100
We need to come in.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.934
It's an emergency situation.

11:37.934 --> 11:39.367
TONYA:
Come in.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.867
Ma'am, have you seen

11:44.867 --> 11:47.800
a yoga-teaching celebrity
pooch-napper?

11:49.834 --> 11:52.000
(<i>deep voice </i>):
Excuse me.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.200
Can't a large woman relax
in peace?

11:58.100 --> 12:01.734
Just because my head
is disproportionate to my body

12:01.734 --> 12:06.767
doesn't mean I don't deserve
my privacy.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.467
Right. Sorry.

12:10.033 --> 12:10.967
A word of caution.

12:10.967 --> 12:13.300
This girl's dangerous.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.300
If you see her,

12:15.300 --> 12:17.467
call me.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.834
'Cause I'm taking her down.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.033
(<i>dog growling </i>)

12:32.367 --> 12:34.734
That's my stomach, uh, growling.

12:34.734 --> 12:36.200
Hush, stomach.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.367
Stay, stomach.

12:38.367 --> 12:40.667
Stay!

12:40.667 --> 12:42.800
Good stomach.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.000
Good stomach.

12:46.567 --> 12:50.100
Okay, Rae,
do you want to tell
me what's going on?

12:50.100 --> 12:52.967
Okay, Mom. Well...

12:52.967 --> 12:55.000
The reason I came
to the spa with you

12:55.000 --> 12:56.900
was because I had
a vision that Myesha

12:56.900 --> 12:59.367
was going to be here
and I wanted to meet her.

12:59.367 --> 13:01.100
So you lied to me.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.734
You didn't come here
to have fun with me.

13:03.734 --> 13:06.100
This is fun.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.233
You cleaned your plates.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.834
Time to dirty 'em up again.

13:22.834 --> 13:23.834
Okay, guys, look,

13:23.834 --> 13:25.000
I got to go
take a shower

13:25.000 --> 13:26.200
and get ready
for work.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.500
I'm going to leave this
for you right there.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.600
Come on, dig in, dig in.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.867
Oh, great.

13:30.867 --> 13:32.133
Oh, okay.

13:33.233 --> 13:35.800
(<i>laughs </i>)

13:35.800 --> 13:37.300
(<i>laughs, then cries </i>)

13:39.367 --> 13:41.200
Ugh! That's awful.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.400
Come here.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.367
No way.

13:43.367 --> 13:45.233
No more potatoes in my pants.

13:45.233 --> 13:46.500
(<i>squishing sound </i>)

13:46.500 --> 13:47.800
You know what? He is right.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.200
We better go dump this
in the sink.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.200
The sink.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.700
Chels, you are such a genius.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.567
Really?

13:53.567 --> 13:55.767
'Cause I don't actually
really get that a lot.

13:55.767 --> 13:57.200
Hey, can we move this along?

13:57.200 --> 14:00.066
This first batch
is starting to harden.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.033
CHELSEA:
Ooh!

14:07.033 --> 14:08.200
It's not going down!

14:08.200 --> 14:10.400
The sink won't swallow
this stuff either.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.467
Beat it!

14:14.500 --> 14:16.133
Now, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

14:16.133 --> 14:18.300
(<i>loud gurgling </i>)

14:18.300 --> 14:19.400
(<i>loud belch </i>)

14:19.400 --> 14:20.967
It's gone!

14:20.967 --> 14:22.500
Yay.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.233
We saved ourselves.

14:24.233 --> 14:27.200
And more importantly, Corey,
we saved mankind.

14:30.934 --> 14:32.367
Ooh!

14:32.367 --> 14:33.467
Oh, man,

14:33.467 --> 14:36.000
I got to call a plumber.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.300
There's a weird slime
coming out of the shower.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.400
Why does this slime
smell like Grandma's potatoes?

14:43.400 --> 14:44.834
Well, uh...

14:44.834 --> 14:46.233
because we kind

14:46.233 --> 14:48.567
of dumped them
down the sink

14:48.567 --> 14:51.000
and they must have backed up
through the shower.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.500
Why'd you dump 'em
down the sink?'

14:53.500 --> 14:55.467
'Cause Corey's pants were full.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.367
Full of what?

15:00.367 --> 15:02.900
Your potatoes.

15:03.934 --> 15:07.000
Dad, they're just nasty.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.667
Guys, why didn't you tell me
that you didn't like 'em?

15:10.667 --> 15:13.567
Well, because we didn't want
to hurt your feelings, Mr. B.

15:13.567 --> 15:15.500
(<i>laughs </i>)

15:15.500 --> 15:16.600
To be perfectly honest, guys,

15:16.600 --> 15:18.200
I never really liked 'em
much, either.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.000
So why do you keep making 'em?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.834
'Cause you told me
you liked 'em.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.734
Which is exactly what
I used to tell my mother.

15:25.734 --> 15:27.133
Okay, look, guys,
from now on,

15:27.133 --> 15:29.000
if you don't like something,
then just tell me, okay?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Cool with me.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.467
Cool. All right.

15:31.467 --> 15:35.033
Well, Dad, I got to tell you,
since we're being honest,

15:35.033 --> 15:36.367
your potatoes are rubbing me
the wrong way.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.400
Corey, I already know
you don't like 'em.

15:38.400 --> 15:43.600
No, they are rubbing me
the wrong way!

15:43.600 --> 15:46.100
I got to get out
of these pants.

15:47.700 --> 15:48.900
Okay, I found out

15:48.900 --> 15:50.667
that Myesha's massage is
here in five minutes,

15:50.667 --> 15:52.867
so we leave the dog,
Myesha finds him,

15:52.867 --> 15:54.000
we hit the road,

15:54.000 --> 15:55.834
and we'll pretend
like this never happened.

15:55.834 --> 15:57.033
Oh, Mom, I love
that plan.

15:57.033 --> 16:00.100
Especially the pretending part.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.834
Come here, Truffles.
All right.

16:01.834 --> 16:03.600
Auntie Raven's
going to leave you here

16:03.600 --> 16:05.133
to find your mommy,
okay, sugar?

16:05.133 --> 16:08.000
Don't go into any more
strange baths.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.800
Not good.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.767
MYESHA:
Carl, I'm going to be in here
getting my massage.

16:11.767 --> 16:12.767
Mom, she's early.

16:12.767 --> 16:14.400
I thought divas
were always late.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.133
And listen, you better
guard this door,

16:17.133 --> 16:20.800
because I heard that maniac
is still on the loose!

16:30.900 --> 16:32.600
I really need this massage.

16:33.967 --> 16:35.734
This has been the worst day
of my life.

16:35.734 --> 16:37.867
And I miss my Truffles.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.300
I am Inga,
your Swedish masseuse.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.934
Then what are you doing
under the table?

17:01.000 --> 17:04.367
This is where we start,
with the lips.

17:06.300 --> 17:09.567
We pull and we pull
like milking the cow.

17:09.567 --> 17:11.300

17:13.200 --> 17:16.734

Okay, then, here we go.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.700
Kneading the necken.

17:27.700 --> 17:31.400
Okay, now you're
a Swedish meatball.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.400
Wait a minute.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.934
What are you doing?

17:33.934 --> 17:35.300
Where is the oil?

17:35.300 --> 17:37.300
<i>Ja, </i>the oil.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.867
Where is the oil?

17:39.667 --> 17:41.600
Got to get the oil

17:41.600 --> 17:44.800
for the massaging
the necken.

Just a moment on the oil.

Excuse me.

What's taking so long?

17:55.834 --> 17:57.900
Oh, wait a minute.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.233
So much tension
in the necken.

17:59.233 --> 18:02.600
Got to relax
and let it go.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.700
Gotten the oil.

belongs to you.

Oh, Truffles.
Oh, baby.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.000
Mommy was so worried
about you.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.667
Did the bad little girl
hurt you?

19:30.667 --> 19:32.767
Oh, no, that
was an accident.

19:32.767 --> 19:34.500
Carl, don't just
stand there.

and defend that sick, twisted...

a pop diva and all,

19:44.900 --> 19:46.900
but nobody talks
that way about my daughter.

Well, your daughter stole
my Truffles.

Raven is your biggest fan.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.200
All she wanted to do
was meet you.

Yeah, Myesha.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.400

someone an apology.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.734
Right.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.600
And Carl...

20:17.400 --> 20:20.033
I accept.

20:20.934 --> 20:22.100
Raven.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.300
Myesha, I'm sorry
I ruined your weekend.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.300
And, Mom, I'm sorry
I lied to you

20:28.300 --> 20:29.967
just so I could
meet Myesha.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.934
(<i>Myesha laughs </i>)

20:31.934 --> 20:33.133
So that's it, huh?

20:33.133 --> 20:36.300
You lied
to your own mother
just to meet me.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.367
And, girl,
that is so cool!

20:38.367 --> 20:40.033
That is so sweet!
You go, girl!

20:40.033 --> 20:41.700
Carl, don't just stand there.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.867
Get me one of my CDs
and a pen,

20:43.867 --> 20:47.800
'cause Myesha has some
autographs to sign.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.100
Mom, despite everything
that happened today,

20:51.100 --> 20:53.700
I had real fun
hanging out with you.

20:53.700 --> 20:54.734
Really?

20:54.734 --> 20:56.767
You know, I do lots
of fun things.

20:56.767 --> 20:58.734
You should come
to my gardening club.

20:58.734 --> 21:00.200
It's radish week.

21:00.200 --> 21:03.000
Oh, it is?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.834
That'd be fun.

21:05.834 --> 21:08.233
Or we could

21:08.233 --> 21:10.300
go to a Myesha concert.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.900
(<i>shudders with excitement </i>)

21:11.900 --> 21:14.800
Carl, hook 'em up
with some tickets.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.233
Yeah, Carl, some tickets.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.500
Backstage passes
I would like.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.834
I would like a limo ride,

21:19.834 --> 21:22.100
and girl, maybe you could
put me on the stage

21:22.100 --> 21:23.467
and I could be
your backup dancer.

21:23.467 --> 21:27.033

with a private jet. ♪

21:31.233 --> 21:36.767
♪ I'm just a simple girl

21:36.767 --> 21:38.767
