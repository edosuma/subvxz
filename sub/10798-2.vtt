00:44.794 --> 00:47.921

are more intense.

Well, we're acquainted with
the wormhole phenomenon, but this...

07:38.541 --> 07:40.834
This appears quite different.

- Nothing, sir.

Mr. Data, you must mean
that it's empty of matter.

There's always
some energy form at work.

07:53.097 --> 07:56.057
Sir, our sensors are showing this
to be the absence of everything.

07:56.225 --> 07:59.227
lt is a void without matter
or energy of any kind.

07:59.395 --> 08:02.230
Yet this hole has a form, Data.
lt has height, width.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.941
Perhaps. Perhaps not, sir.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.112
That's hardly a scientific observation,
commander.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.283
Captain, the most elementary
and valuable statement in science,

08:13.451 --> 08:16.745
the beginning of wisdom, is,
"l do not know."

08:16.913 --> 08:20.040
l do not know what that is, sir.

08:20.208 --> 08:26.421
Captain, if this were
any ordinary kind of hole in space,

08:27.298 --> 08:29.341

what's behind it?

10:04.729 --> 10:07.355
Mr. Worf, this starship operates best

10:07.523 --> 10:10.900
when my officers share with me
what is on their minds.

10:12.403 --> 10:17.365
My thoughts
were of an old Klingon legend

10:19.535 --> 10:21.453
of a gigantic black space creature

10:21.621 --> 10:24.372
which was said
to devour entire vessels.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.626
Devour vessels?

10:28.210 --> 10:32.672
Sorry, commander. l agree
these are thoughts hardly worthy

10:32.840 --> 10:36.217

security officer.

10:36.385 --> 10:40.138
Mr. Worf,

around it?

too far out into the ocean,

it would fall off the edge
of the world?

to hang their captain from the yardarm

denies that conclusion.

15:03.193 --> 15:06.029
Might we have moved
into another dimension?

Could a lack of dimension
be another dimension in itself?
