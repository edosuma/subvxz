I mean, what are your
actual policies?

22:31.219 --> 22:33.308
Well, why don't you tell me
what I'm thinking.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.920
I just heard you up here
in front of the Democrats

22:36.964 --> 22:39.270
saying that what
they were doing was fucked.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.925
Well, I agree.
So, what should they do?

22:41.969 --> 22:43.840
You just said to me out there,

22:43.884 --> 22:46.713
why not burn down the Democratic
Party and start over?

22:46.756 --> 22:48.584
Well, here I am!

22:48.628 --> 22:50.499
Mr. Moneybags
to make it happen.

22:50.543 --> 22:53.110
I don't want
to dig a tunnel under L.A.

22:53.154 --> 22:55.330
I want democracy to work.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.289
So, let's do it.

23:00.683 --> 23:03.077
TV REPORTER: Legal experts
believe that 11 states

23:03.120 --> 23:05.166
will outlaw gay marriage
outright

23:05.209 --> 23:08.430
and 14 others will require
some kind of union certificate

23:08.474 --> 23:10.432
granted by a judge.

23:10.476 --> 23:12.695
Said certificates will require
meetings with probationary

children out of the womb.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.706
Who the hell needs
an AR-15 these days?

23:23.750 --> 23:27.014
When did Republicans
go from crazy to evil?

23:28.842 --> 23:30.060
A beer please.

23:31.584 --> 23:34.717
I know you, don't I?

23:34.761 --> 23:36.545
No, I don't think so.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.112
The NRA protest.

23:38.155 --> 23:39.635
We chained
ourselves to the doors.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.856
No, no, I don't think
that was me.

23:42.899 --> 23:44.510
You were so nice.

23:44.553 --> 23:45.902
You kept me
from getting pepper-sprayed.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.817
This is the man
I told you about.

23:47.861 --> 23:50.124
At the "March For Our Lives."
He kept the police off me.

23:50.167 --> 23:51.908
How did you
get inside the building?

23:51.952 --> 23:53.475
Did you break in
with the earlier group?

23:53.519 --> 23:56.086
No. I was heading
out to lunch.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.306
Headed out?
What do you mean?

23:58.349 --> 24:01.657
I work with the NRA. Thanks.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.050
Nice meeting you.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.183
[phone dings]

24:06.227 --> 24:07.707
Is that Jay?

24:07.750 --> 24:10.100
No, it's Diane.
She's back in the Great Room

24:10.144 --> 24:11.928
talking with Neil Gross.

24:11.972 --> 24:14.104
Good talking or bad talking?

24:14.148 --> 24:15.323
Good.

24:15.366 --> 24:17.064
He wants us to help him

24:17.107 --> 24:18.935
buy the Democratic Party.

24:21.155 --> 24:22.765
Mr. Baruch?

24:22.809 --> 24:25.507
Hi, I'm Marissa Gold,
Carmen's associate.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.901
She got called away.
So, she asked me to help you.

24:27.944 --> 24:29.859
Hi. How are you?

24:29.903 --> 24:31.121
-What's your name?
-Where's Carmen?

24:31.165 --> 24:32.645
She got called away.

24:32.688 --> 24:34.603
So, she asked me
to introduce you around.

24:38.781 --> 24:41.958
I'm not the B team, sir.

24:42.002 --> 24:44.961
Do you want an introduction
to the head of the DNC or not?

24:45.005 --> 24:47.355
How do you know
the head of the DNC?

24:47.398 --> 24:48.748
He's a friend of my father's.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.577
Yes, please introduce me.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.448
Diane, there you are.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.189
I bumped into Neil Gross.

24:55.232 --> 24:57.104
And we're talking
about remaking the party.

24:57.147 --> 24:58.801
You don't have to pretend,
Diane.

24:58.845 --> 25:00.977
I knew your partners
would join us.

25:01.021 --> 25:03.153
That's what
the smell of money does.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.807
Well, we want to be involved

25:04.851 --> 25:06.374
with whatever you're
interested in, Mr. Gross.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.855
I want to talk to
the DNC about buying them out.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.598
Good. We can
work up a proposal.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.556
-Set a meeting for next week.
-Oh, no.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.427
I want to talk to them now.

25:18.168 --> 25:19.779
Elfman is here, right?

25:19.822 --> 25:22.825
Yes, but I don't think
this is the best time.

25:22.869 --> 25:24.566
You don't think the death

25:24.610 --> 25:26.437
of the Democratic Party
is the right moment to talk

25:26.481 --> 25:28.614
about buying
the Democratic Party?

25:28.657 --> 25:32.356
It just seems better
to be well-prepared.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.185
Elfman is not Frank Landau.
You have to win him over.

25:35.229 --> 25:37.231
I'm not worried
about winning him over.

25:37.274 --> 25:38.841
-Why's that?
-Well, if he

25:38.885 --> 25:41.670
says "no" I reveal
all the data I have on him.

JULIUS:
I'm sorry, what?

25:45.935 --> 25:49.504

Everything from Chumhum.

25:52.812 --> 25:56.772
Oh, boy. Clutch my pearls.
I've offended you?

25:56.816 --> 26:00.297
See, these are the tactics
the Republicans have perfected.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.300
You want
Manchin to vote with you

26:03.344 --> 26:05.389
instead of being
a perpetual cock block?

26:05.433 --> 26:07.348
Show him what I have on him.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.045
He will lead the charge
on overturning the filibuster.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.091
You want
to blackmail other Democrats?

26:11.134 --> 26:13.833
My God, it's like
you're all driving Buicks.

26:13.876 --> 26:16.444
I just gave you
a solution to your problem.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.272
A problem that could
solve abortion rights,

26:18.315 --> 26:19.882
a-and gun control,

26:19.926 --> 26:21.754
and health care,
and yet you guys hesitate.

26:23.799 --> 26:25.801
Okay, here's
my formalized proposal.

26:26.933 --> 26:30.240
Get some balls or get out.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.287
Hi, how are you doing?

26:33.330 --> 26:34.810
Marissa, nice to see you.

26:34.854 --> 26:35.942
How's your dad?

26:35.985 --> 26:37.770
MARISSA:
Hating D.C.

26:37.813 --> 26:39.510
Yeah, sorry about that.
Things have gotten strange.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.512
Um, have you met Ben-Baruch?

26:41.556 --> 26:42.992
He's called
the crypto king of Tel Aviv.

26:43.036 --> 26:43.993
It's nice to meet you.

26:44.037 --> 26:46.039
Did you know Frank long?

26:46.082 --> 26:48.258
-Who?
-The one we're mourning.

26:48.302 --> 26:50.130
Oh, no, I didn't.

26:50.173 --> 26:51.958
I'm here actually to set up
a dark money PAC

26:52.001 --> 26:54.090
-for the Democrats.
-JOHNNY: Really?

26:54.134 --> 26:55.962

$300 million in initial funding.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.528
Well, that's great news.

26:57.572 --> 26:59.182
We could use all the help
we can get these days.

26:59.226 --> 27:02.751
My ex-fiancée threw away
my hard drive in a fit of rage

27:02.795 --> 27:05.580
and now I need it back.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.017
I don't think I understand.

27:08.061 --> 27:09.671
I need you to excavate
the city landfill.

Me personally?

27:12.282 --> 27:14.241
No, you politically.

I have $750 million in Bitcoin
sitting in city landfill

27:18.593 --> 27:20.595

and puppy chow.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.641
Mr. Baruch,
we'd be happy to help you

27:22.684 --> 27:24.207
get the paperwork started

27:24.251 --> 27:25.948
on a rezoning order.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.908
It'll take some time, but
that's the best we could offer.

27:28.951 --> 27:31.954
I'm offering you $300 million
in dark money.

27:31.998 --> 27:34.478
Yeah, and again, we'd love
to help you with the paperwork.

27:34.522 --> 27:36.524
Are you fucking serious?

27:36.567 --> 27:39.179
If this was the RNC,
they would drain Lake Michigan.

Well, we're not the RNC.
