my father did this
to her in her nightmare?

She used her ability
to find him for you
and slipped into this.

(EXHALES)
She was so afraid.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.644

asked her to look
for him.

something to her,

shoved a gun in my face.

he's flying through

His name is Lonny Stills.
He's a local gang banger.

want to be a snitch.
It's dangerous.

But in order for me
to get this guy
off the street,

03:16.822 --> 03:20.110
I need somebody
to step up and ID him,

I can't do that.

of the afternoon.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.263

03:55.319 --> 03:57.685

used to this.

you don't remember
your past,

04:11.502 --> 04:13.914
it doesn't mean
you don't have one.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.461
Aren't you curious
about who you are
or where you come from?

04:16.549 --> 04:18.710
You've seen what I can do.

04:18.801 --> 04:22.965
There's a side of me that
I can't control. Maybe it's
best if I don't dig too deep.

you are, even if you don't.

in that box will tell you

who didn't want me
to look in that box?

you hadn't kissed me yet.

it was him?

05:17.735 --> 05:21.398
Yeah. We found him
cuffed inside here
a few nights back.

And she calls you
the nightmare man.

12:37.841 --> 12:38.956
She's looking for me.
Yeah.

12:39.051 --> 12:40.916
And she saw you
looking back at her,
and now she won't wake up.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.251
So, whatever you did,
undo it now.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.507

similar threats, both taken
from the same picture.

we could help people.

to stop them.

or all those other people
