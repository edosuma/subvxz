WEBVTT

00:02.627 --> 00:03.628
DOROTHY: <i>Good morning.</i>

00:11.052 --> 00:13.638
Maybe I should go on
<i>The Don Chesler Show</i> more often.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.850
(chuckles) That could be arranged.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.352
Item six, a memo from Division.

00:19.436 --> 00:22.188
Since the new copy machines
have been installed,

00:22.689 --> 00:26.818
printing costs from all precincts
have risen over 300 percent.

00:27.152 --> 00:30.363
Starting noon today,
the copier will accept

00:30.447 --> 00:33.283
only those documents
that have been stamped

00:33.366 --> 00:35.076
with a police identification code.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.288
Furthermore,
the department will absorb the cost

00:38.371 --> 00:40.665
of four and only four reprints.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.792
Any number over four and it's your nickel.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.461
J.D.: Hey, Sarge. Sergeant.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.588
Are you aware
that the DA's office is asking

00:46.671 --> 00:49.257
for five copies of all arrest reports?

00:49.340 --> 00:52.635
Which is why God
invented carbon paper, Detective.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.846
-Oh, good.
-Assignments-- Assignments, people.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.724
Lieutenant Buntz
continues undercover investigation

00:57.807 --> 01:01.144
of those durable vermin,
our local shylocks.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.064
Plus, Officer Russo and Jackson

01:04.147 --> 01:08.151
assist Division
in arresting Dominic Donatelli

01:08.234 --> 01:11.780
and other key figures in their liquor
racketeering investigation.

01:11.863 --> 01:15.283
Good bust. And Detective Belker
establishes undercover

01:15.366 --> 01:17.744
at, uh, Captain Trident's Fish World.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.204
That's 87th and Drexel.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.498
We understand that they are distributing

01:21.581 --> 01:25.335
something more than
finny little creatures from the sea.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.545
Namely drugs of a recreational nature.

01:28.379 --> 01:31.591
And for today's sweep
of the Van Buren corridor,

01:31.674 --> 01:34.469
all designated units
coordinate with Lieutenant Goldblume

01:34.552 --> 01:36.513
at your preassigned rendezvous point.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.306
That's 1100 hours.

01:38.389 --> 01:41.392
Item last, in case you haven't seen it,

01:41.476 --> 01:44.979
retired Sergeant Stanislav Jablonski's

01:45.063 --> 01:49.943
beaming face graces the front page
of our morning tabloid.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.695
-(cheering)
-A shining example to us all

01:52.779 --> 01:54.614
that good policemen never retire.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.241
They just go on standby duty.

01:56.324 --> 01:59.619
All right, let's get out there
and serve and protect. Dismissed.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.164
(gavel bangs)

02:04.833 --> 02:07.210
Allow me to apologize
to my fellow subcommittee members

02:07.293 --> 02:10.046
for dragging you away from your beds
before the cock crows,

02:10.130 --> 02:13.591
but captain Furillo's hectic schedule

02:13.675 --> 02:15.802
prevented our meeting
at a more civil hour.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.596
It's hard for me to take time
away from my job, Councilman.

02:19.013 --> 02:20.932
Frankly, I'm not sure
why you even called this hearing.

02:21.015 --> 02:22.433
Then let me tell you, Captain.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.478
The sale and distribution
of the highly addictive

02:25.562 --> 02:28.106
and dangerous form of cocaine,
known as crack,

02:28.189 --> 02:31.151
has increased in your precinct
by 48 percent.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.819
And that's a conservative estimate.

02:33.736 --> 02:36.072
I want to know what you people
at Hill Street are doing about it.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.866
Fine, you want to know?
I'm here to tell you.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.201
(humming)

02:43.538 --> 02:45.039
Hey, come on, hurry up. J.D.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.292
Warm.

02:51.462 --> 02:52.755
Yes.

02:54.215 --> 02:57.844
I'm sorry, Patrick.
I don't know a Sister Chastity.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.679
-She said she knows me?
-Absolutely.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.182
I meet this real nice nun,

03:02.265 --> 03:04.851
and we get to talking and she says
she knows you and the captain.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.521
Sister Chastity? Doesn't ring a bell.

03:12.942 --> 03:16.404
Hey, Lieutenant. Saw your interview
on <i>The Don Chesler Show</i> last night.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.990
-You did great.
-Thanks, Bobby.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.286
Looks a little ragged, doesn't he?
A little ripe?

03:23.369 --> 03:24.829
Look at this.

03:24.913 --> 03:25.788
What is this?

03:26.456 --> 03:28.625
What in the world is this?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.502
(laughing)

03:34.589 --> 03:36.049
NUN: Nobody I recognize.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.134
Sister Chastity, don't look at that.

03:39.427 --> 03:43.139
HOWARD:
Judas H. Priest. It's Grace Gardner.

03:43.514 --> 03:46.142
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:46.935 --> 03:48.228
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:48.311 --> 03:52.065
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:52.148 --> 03:53.691
(sirens wailing)

03:59.447 --> 04:02.450
(theme music playing)

05:59.942 --> 06:02.737
You look radiant, Grace.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.697
-Sister.
-(laughs)

06:04.781 --> 06:05.615
Thank you, Frank.

06:06.407 --> 06:10.036
Admittedly, it-it looks like
a radical departure from the outside,

06:10.119 --> 06:11.204
but inside...

06:12.747 --> 06:14.040
it feels as natural as breathing.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.793
I'm happy for you.
What's the name of your order?

06:16.876 --> 06:19.087
St. Cecilia. We're located upstate.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.381
It's a very small community,
but we're growing.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.050
Reaching out,
which is why I'm here, Frank.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.928
I have persuaded the Mother Superior

06:27.220 --> 06:30.348
to establish a presence
in the most destitute part of this city.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.433
-You mean up here on the Hill.
-You bet.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.186
Can you think of a place
more in need of a rebirth of hope?

06:35.269 --> 06:38.272
Oh, Frank, I have got such plans.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.150
First we're going to establish
a youth counseling center.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.694
Then move on to the family,
community groups,

06:43.778 --> 06:46.739
-eventually a school.
-I respect your intensions, Sister,

06:46.823 --> 06:49.158
but, you know,
the Hill is rougher than ever.

06:49.242 --> 06:53.788
We're going to bring joy and light
to the darkest corners of this city.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.793
Frank, I was hoping you might make
one of your officers a liaison

06:58.876 --> 07:01.003
to help me find a suitable site
for our center.

07:01.504 --> 07:04.132
-It's a good idea.
-I've met an Officer Flaherty.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.260
(sighs) Flaherty's pretty new to the Hill.

07:09.929 --> 07:10.847
But if he's willing.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.223
He will be.

07:13.474 --> 07:14.308
Thank you, Frank.

07:16.185 --> 07:17.311
It's so good to see you again.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.897
(chuckles)
You may have made some changes, Sister,

07:19.981 --> 07:21.649
but you're as determined as ever.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.317
(laughs) More.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.362
-Morning, Howard.
-Morning, Chief.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.162
Hello, Howard.

07:37.748 --> 07:38.624
Grace.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.042
Sister.

07:40.751 --> 07:41.711
Long time.

07:42.670 --> 07:46.299
I am so glad to hear
that you're carrying Phil's staff forward.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.634
He would be so proud.

07:50.761 --> 07:51.596
Thank you.

07:52.722 --> 07:53.556
So...

07:55.433 --> 07:57.310
what have you been doing with yourself?

07:57.393 --> 07:59.979
I specifically told you
to cooperate with Wade.

08:00.062 --> 08:02.398
I presented all the information
he asked for.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.775
You didn't appear responsive
to his recommendation.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.153
His recommendations were unrealistic.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.822
I can't redeploy all my men
to fight drug traffic.

08:09.906 --> 08:13.117
Granted, Frank, but Wade controls
the purse strings to this department.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.994
Councilman Wade is a demagogue

08:15.077 --> 08:16.829
exploiting the problems
of this department.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.706
For God's sake, Frank.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.625
Just throw the man a bone.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.669
I notice you have a drug sweep
set for this morning.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.381
Give Wade the details. Let him be there.
Make the announcement afterwards.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.842
-Grab a little press.
-I can't do that.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.386
Undercover officers have spent a week

08:32.470 --> 08:34.805
targeting specific dealers
in the Van Buren corridor.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.558
I'm not about to jeopardize that
by informing outsiders.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.769
We don't operate in a vacuum, Frank.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.273
One of these days,
you're gonna realize that.

08:45.066 --> 08:45.983
(door shuts)

08:46.067 --> 08:49.153
"Joey Glover thought
he could rob a city bus.

08:49.445 --> 08:53.407
Instead he got a one-way ride
to the city jail

08:53.491 --> 08:55.660
thanks to retired police sergeant

08:55.743 --> 08:59.288
Stanislav Jablonski."
How about that, Blackie?

08:59.372 --> 09:02.124
Thirty years on the force,
never got my name in the paper.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.503
(chuckles) Retired a few weeks,
there I am on page one.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.839
Maybe now-- Hey, maybe now
you'll show me some respect, huh?

09:08.923 --> 09:10.925
(phone rings)

09:14.387 --> 09:15.221
Morning.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.223
Yeah, speaking.

09:18.641 --> 09:22.311
No, no, I never gave much thought
to security work.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.565
No, I'm one cop who's happy in retirement.

09:27.984 --> 09:28.818
Really?

09:29.777 --> 09:31.237
Dental coverage, too?

09:32.488 --> 09:36.075
Well, let me look
in my appointment book, will you?

09:37.702 --> 09:40.955
Blackie, you never let on
that you want something.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.959
No, Thursday is no good for me.
How about Wednesday?

09:45.876 --> 09:48.045
Okay. Okay. Wednesday at 10:00.

09:48.921 --> 09:49.755
Bye-bye.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.300
(laughs) Blackie.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.052
How about that, huh? How about that?

09:55.136 --> 09:57.555
(jackhammers pounding)

10:05.771 --> 10:08.274
I'm making money,
Captain Trident's getting his piece.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.942
-What's the problem?
-The problem, Horowitz,

10:10.026 --> 10:12.528
is we pay you
to sell Captain Trident's fish wares,

10:12.612 --> 10:13.988
Not whatever the hell this is.

10:14.071 --> 10:17.158
What is this? Ham hocks?
That's disgusting.

10:17.742 --> 10:21.120
Let me tell you something. I tried selling
your damn fish cubes. Hmm?

10:21.203 --> 10:23.372
We almost went into chapter 11, Granger.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.250
I mean, this whole place almost went down
the tubes if it hadn't been for him.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.877
This Picasso with a spatula.

10:27.960 --> 10:31.714
(chuckles) I mean, once he started cooking
his soul food, business took off.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.925
Listen, Horowitz, Captain Trident
doesn't get volume discount on soul food.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.219
Captain Trident
gets volume discount on these.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.638
And when you got Captain Trident

10:38.721 --> 10:40.890
to build you this place,
you agreed to sell these.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.517
Now in your kitchen right now,
you got ten cartons of the cubes.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.145
And if you don't start moving it,
we're gonna shut you down

10:46.228 --> 10:48.397
faster than you can say black eyed peas.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.441
Out! Out! Out!

10:51.025 --> 10:53.736
Hey, take it easy. It's not worth it.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.029
Guy drives me nuts.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.908
Detective Michael Belker,
Hill Street station.

10:59.992 --> 11:00.868
Of course.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.621
-Can we sit down?
-Yeah, sure.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.001
Mr. Horowitz, we have a good tip

11:09.085 --> 11:13.089
that someone is distributing drugs
through your restaurant.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.092
We have enough information
to close you right now.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.343
Ay-yi-yi.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.604
Art Manes, Mr. McGuire.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.232
Mr. Manes, have a seat.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.819
Tony Manfredi tells me
you want to borrow a couple of bucks.

11:34.902 --> 11:38.656
Hey, if 5,000 is a couple of bucks,
God bless you.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.618
-Know what shared risk means, Mr. Manes?
-Excuse me?

11:42.702 --> 11:45.329
Say another fella puts bread on the table
same way I do.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.707
Makes loans to worthy applicants.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.750
Now suppose I take a piece
of that fella's commitments

11:49.834 --> 11:51.168
and he takes a piece of mine.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.505
That way, if the borrower
turns out to be a deadbeat,

11:54.588 --> 11:57.633
if he stiffs us out,
the exposure is only 50 percent.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.009
See, well, I wouldn't do that.

12:00.302 --> 12:03.639
That'd be called shared risk, Mr. Manes.
You follow me?

12:04.974 --> 12:05.808
Yeah.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.644
Now you want to hear a funny coincidence?

12:09.228 --> 12:10.104
Okay.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.315
You're here
to try and borrow money from me,

12:14.233 --> 12:16.277
and it turns out you're already into me.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.614
I took a piece of that loan
you made last week with Teddy Falco.

12:22.324 --> 12:23.409
You shared the risk?

12:23.492 --> 12:25.369
I shared the risk. That's right.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.581
Are you trying to run a game, Mr. Manes?

12:31.917 --> 12:33.627
-Let me explain.
-No, because if you're here

12:33.711 --> 12:36.088
trying to take off Peter
to tighten up Paul,

12:36.172 --> 12:37.381
you can forget about it

12:38.340 --> 12:39.717
'cause Peter and Paul is the same guy.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.218
(footsteps)

12:42.261 --> 12:43.095
Mr. Falco.

12:44.472 --> 12:45.431
What's going on?

12:45.514 --> 12:49.393
Now, you want to be very careful
about the next thing you say, Mr. Manes.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.146
You want to be sure you tell us the truth.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.442
(clears throat) Look, Mr. Falco,
I had a chance to make the move.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.653
I knew I didn't have enough collateral
to go back to you.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.323
-MCGUIRE: What kind of move?
-Coke.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.658
Guy I know is-- he's in service.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.411
He can, uh,
he can move six lids a week.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.163
I swear to God I'm telling the truth.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.540
What's your product cost?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.628
A quarter key of 80 percent
costs me nine grand.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.338
How regular is your buyer?

13:18.047 --> 13:19.882
He can reup, uh, twice a month.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.218
I mean, that's the reason
I took the shot, sir.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.303
This could be a real breakthrough for me.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.096
Suppose we could put you with a guy,

13:26.180 --> 13:29.266
move the same weight and purity for 8,250.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.102
(soft chuckle)
Are you kidding me?

13:32.686 --> 13:34.396
(scoffs)
I could make the whole play in six hours

13:34.480 --> 13:36.315
and get your money back to you tonight.
I'd kiss your feet.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.025
The vig would be 40 percent.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.111
Hey, money costs money. I understand that.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.659
Be back here at noon.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.995
Mr. Falco, Mr. McGuire.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.581
The two of you are not gonna regret this.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.923
You were supposed to be in position
ten minutes ago, Rogers.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.801
ROGERS (on radio): <i>The street was closed</i>
<i>down, Lieutenant. Give us a minute.</i>

14:04.718 --> 14:07.096
I mean, tell me something,
what would you do about it?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.765
-I don't know.
-I mean, you just can't, you know,

14:09.849 --> 14:11.016
call in the US Air Force

14:11.100 --> 14:12.560
and have the nuke
the whole Van Buren corridor

14:12.643 --> 14:14.228
and build it back up in 50 years,
now, could you?

14:14.311 --> 14:15.980
-Nope.
-Nope.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.982
'Cause, you see, these are human beings.
We've been told that.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.401
I mean, their brains are fried.
It's like they've got guava jelly

14:20.484 --> 14:22.111
between their ears,
but they're human beings.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.904
Right, Renko. They're all zombies

14:23.988 --> 14:25.865
and there's nothing
that we can do about it.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.700
You know, did it ever make you feel like

14:27.783 --> 14:29.827
you're one of them guys
who cleans up at the circus?

14:29.910 --> 14:32.955
-There's the big old pile of doo-doo--
-I get the drift, Renko.

14:33.038 --> 14:36.041
Next day the elephants come back
and this big old pile of doo-doo--

14:36.125 --> 14:37.376
I get it, okay?

14:38.043 --> 14:39.753
ROGERS (on radio):
<i>All right, people. One minute.</i>

14:40.004 --> 14:41.547
You got your pooper scooper, darling?

14:41.630 --> 14:44.425
So after Sam Gardner died,

14:44.508 --> 14:48.220
Sister Chastity had a relationship
with Sergeant Esterhaus?

14:48.304 --> 14:50.431
Grace Gardner had the relationship
with Sergeant Esterhaus.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.142
-That's what I meant.
-There's a bit of difference.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.770
Would you give me a break? I never met
a nun who was a person before, okay?

14:57.938 --> 15:00.107
-Okay, you ready to go?
-Absolutely.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.151
ROGERS:
<i>All right, let's get ready to do it.</i>

15:02.234 --> 15:07.031
Five, four, three, two, one. Go.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.617
(sirens wailing)

15:23.005 --> 15:24.131
You know, I don't understand this at all.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.425
I mean, there ain't nobody around here
doesn't look like...

15:27.676 --> 15:30.512
Officers, excuse me.
Kelly Martin, Action News.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.139
Is this the drug sweep
that we've heard about

15:32.222 --> 15:34.058
and if so, what action can we expect?

15:34.141 --> 15:36.101
Let me ask you a question, lady.
Why are you here?

15:36.185 --> 15:38.520
-We were informed of a sweep.
-Who told you that?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.856
-I can't reveal my source.
-Shut that thing off.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.650
-Shut the camera off.
-Excuse me.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.652
Shut the camera off. Get out of here.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.154
-Get the microphone out of my face.
-Hey!

15:47.738 --> 15:50.491
Oh, look at--
Will you look at this. What is this?

15:50.574 --> 15:53.327
REPORTER: Councilman Wade,
is this sweep the result of

15:53.410 --> 15:54.703
the hearing you had this morning

15:54.787 --> 15:56.830
with Captain Furillo
of Hill Street station, sir?

15:56.914 --> 15:58.749
I think it's safe to say so, Ed.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.460
I only wish
he'd use a little more common sense

16:01.543 --> 16:02.753
with deployment of his men.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.339
Obviously this is the wrong time of day
for this kind of sweep.

16:05.422 --> 16:06.256
That's bull.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.384
The reason the sweep didn't work
is 'cause the media

16:08.467 --> 16:12.596
-scared them off before we got here.
-Hey, Andy. I got the one down!

16:12.680 --> 16:15.224
I'll get the kid. Hold it, pal!

16:16.433 --> 16:17.267
Hold it!

16:38.998 --> 16:41.083
He got away,
he's around the corner somewhere.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.211
-All right, we've got to search! Come on.
-What kind of crap is this?

16:46.964 --> 16:49.758
(indistinct radio chatter)

16:49.842 --> 16:52.219
Is it true that you found drugs
and a pipe, Lieutenant?

16:52.302 --> 16:53.554
Can't comment on that.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.807
-Any idea on the boy?
-Not at this moment. Excuse me.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.354
Lost him, Lieutenant.
Andy found his car, though.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.605
It'll give us something to go on.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.983
-See your partner, Andy.
-Right.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.496
Kid couldn't have been
more than ten years old.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.673
Okay, move them out.
Stan, what brings you here?

17:29.757 --> 17:31.717
Oh, I have lunch with Lucy.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.262
I'm a little early.
Busy day, huh, Sergeant?

17:35.345 --> 17:36.513
Well, not as busy as we could be.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.849
Once again, the media
has exercised its precious right

17:38.932 --> 17:40.976
to interfere with police operations.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.478
Excuse me, Stan.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.110
I ain't no druggie, hoss.
I just want to wet my whistle.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.280
If you don't want your whistle broken,
you better stand still... [indistinct]

17:53.363 --> 17:55.032
Take it easy, Patrick.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.366
He didn't tip the press.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.411
-Well, somebody did.
-Not our business.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.829
-You all right?
-Fine.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.581
I just need a couple minutes.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.249
I feel bad about the kid, too.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.751
Two minutes, Renko.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.837
No use beating around the bush, Captain.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.547
I had a job offer this morning.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.342
Security firm read about me
in the newspaper,

18:13.425 --> 18:16.720
and they're awfully hot
to hire a seasoned veteran.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.555
Well, they'd be lucky to get you, Stan.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.351
Yeah, well, the point is, Captain,
I'd-I'd rather stay here.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.645
Have you heard
from the police surgeon's office?

18:24.728 --> 18:27.106
Well, we've missed each other three times.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.149
I don't mean to pressure you, Captain.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.363
I'll have an answer for you
this afternoon, okay?

18:34.446 --> 18:36.406
Oh, thanks. Thanks, Captain.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.912
Ah, Stan, nice work yesterday.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.997
(chuckles)
Can't keep a good cop down, Chief.

18:44.081 --> 18:44.915
Good man.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.712
Chief, Councilman.

18:51.088 --> 18:54.216
I brought Councilman Wade here
away from the limelight

18:54.299 --> 18:56.969
so we could all calmly discuss
how to combat

18:57.052 --> 18:59.054
this serious drug problem
we face together.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.931
I thought the councilman and I
discussed that this morning.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.891
And you said you were doing all you could.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.769
An hour ago,
you used 20 men to make seven arrests.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.147
You call that an efficient use
of manpower?

19:08.230 --> 19:10.774
This morning's sweep was compromised
by a leak to the press.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.985
Something I don't suppose
either one of you'd know anything about.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.279
This man has an infinite capacity
to shift the blame.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.865
-Gentlemen, let's not dwell on the past.
-That's right.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.409
We have the murder
of a ten-year-old boy to deal with.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.493
Any leads, Frank?

19:22.411 --> 19:24.538
You can speak freely
in front of the councilman.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.541
We're looking for a suspect
who fled the scene.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.127
We have the car he was driving.
Hope to trace him through that.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.712
I want you to keep the councilman apprised

19:31.795 --> 19:33.589
-of any progress.
-Fine.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.716
The citizens of this city
are outraged, Captain,

19:35.799 --> 19:40.053
and I can't blame them. We need results
from our police, not excuses.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.347
I think the councilman
is merely trying to emphasize

19:42.431 --> 19:45.100
-the seriousness of the situation.
-Exactly.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.103
I look forward
to your cooperation, Captain.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.981
FLETCHER: I'm sure
that you can count on it, Councilman.

19:55.819 --> 19:59.031
J.D., thank God.
Excuse us for a minute, will you?

20:00.407 --> 20:01.450
Tell me the good news, Rob.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.619
You won the lottery
and you want to share it with me.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.205
Peggy's kicked me out.
I got home a little bit late last night.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.415
All my clothes was thrown out
on the front porch.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.626
Really? Put up a sign.
Have a rummage sale.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.711
Come on, J.D. You can't let me down now.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.130
-Watch me.
-You and me, man, we're family.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.216
-Not before lunch, Rob.
-John! John!

20:17.299 --> 20:18.592
We're talking about your sister here.

20:18.675 --> 20:22.012
Pardon me if I don't see it as tragedy
on the scale with Romeo and Juliet.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.681
She's thrown you out before.
She always gives in.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.266
No, no, not this time. Listen, man.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.644
I pleaded with her.
I was down on my hands and knees.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.729
She didn't get that on video tape,
did she, Rob

20:30.812 --> 20:34.608
John, John. This is killing me.
I-I hear her voice.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.485
I see her reflection in ponds.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.947
Translation, she's gonna hire
a wolverine for an attorney,

20:40.030 --> 20:41.573
you're gonna lose your shorts.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.286
(sighs) Look...

20:47.579 --> 20:50.666
I just got a shipment
of brand-new digital disc players.

20:50.749 --> 20:51.917
Disgusting.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.753
You're trying to get me to sell out
my own flesh and blood.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.881
Come on, John.
She's gonna crucify me in court.

20:58.340 --> 21:01.093
Look, look, look, remember
that set of wheels you were asking about?

21:01.802 --> 21:03.220
-You meant the Cougar?
-Yeah.

21:03.303 --> 21:06.181
The cherry Cougar with the mag wheels
and twin heads.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.267
Yeah. You talk to her,
you get this all straight,

21:08.350 --> 21:09.643
you're behind the wheel, man.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.564
This is asking a lot, Rob.

21:15.774 --> 21:19.820
But I hate to see your dream marriage
go sour. I'm gonna give it a shot.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.989
I'm counting on you, J.D. Counting on you.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.491
-I need to talk to you, Captain.
-In a minute, Norm.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.827
-Neal, J.D.
-J.D.: Yes, sir.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.622
Registration come through
on that BMW from the sweep?

21:30.706 --> 21:33.709
Just now, Captain.
Marsha Jones, 225 Van Buren.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.794
-Top priority.
-We're on it, Captain.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.463
Whoa, whoa, are you talking about
that Beemer out in the parking lot?

21:38.547 --> 21:40.841
The one with the wet bar,
TV and digital disc player?

21:40.924 --> 21:43.010
Yeah, looks like it was being used
by a crack dealer.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.137
The kid could barely see
up over the steering wheel.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.055
I can't believe it. I hate that.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.474
You wanted to see me, Norm?

21:51.101 --> 21:52.728
Turns out the last shy on my list

21:52.811 --> 21:55.272
has a pretty strong
soda connection, Captain.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.150
You want to postpone tonight's bust?

21:59.234 --> 22:00.777
May be able to stay on schedule.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.779
I'm meeting with the supplier at noon.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.824
Captain, are you telling me
that doesn't get to you?

22:06.783 --> 22:07.993
-What?
-What?

22:08.618 --> 22:12.080
A wisenheimer little punk like that
driving a BMW.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.416
It's a slap in the face
of the American dream.

22:14.791 --> 22:15.751
Keep me posted.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.130
Thanks.

22:23.425 --> 22:24.885
So how's it going, Lucy?

22:25.385 --> 22:26.219
Breaking in the new kid?

22:26.553 --> 22:27.721
Oh, yeah. He's all right.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.807
-He's a good cop.
-Nice looking fella.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.934
If you like them tall, dark and handsome.

22:33.018 --> 22:33.852
(chuckles)

22:35.020 --> 22:38.482
Is... is he the religious type?

22:38.940 --> 22:41.526
Uh, Stan, I think he's being recruited.

22:42.986 --> 22:46.114
So, you're supposed to be telling me
what it's like to be your own master.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.700
I mean,
go fishing anytime you get the urge.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.370
-Can you keep a secret?
-Mm-hmm.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.040
There's a good chance
I might be getting back on the job.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.541
-No kidding.
-Yeah.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.418
The captain's looking into it today.

22:58.752 --> 23:02.339
That's great. If that's what you want,
good luck, Stan.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.008
Me, I'd rather go fishing.

23:05.092 --> 23:05.926
(laughs)

23:07.135 --> 23:08.845
Excuse me for a minute, Lucy.

23:10.597 --> 23:13.183
Uh, don't go paying the check
while I'm gone.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.185
GRACE:
You're lapsed, aren't you, Patrick?

23:15.268 --> 23:16.353
Sorry?

23:16.812 --> 23:18.688
You're Catholic
and you're lapsed from the church.

23:20.857 --> 23:22.984
What, were you looking
at my files, Sister?

23:24.444 --> 23:25.737
Your files and your face.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.782
Uh, I stopped when I was 12.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.326
Stopped going to church, you mean?

23:32.327 --> 23:33.245
Stopped believing.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.581
Doubt isn't where faith ends, Patrick.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.001
It's what faith heals.

23:41.128 --> 23:44.381
Um, I guess I don't heal too quick.

23:45.632 --> 23:47.801
Oh, something called me to ask for you.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.637
-What do you mean?
-I asked Captain Furillo

23:50.720 --> 23:53.515
to assign you to me.
To make you my liaison.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.308
Um... (coughs)

23:55.767 --> 23:57.644
Would you excuse me a minute, Sister?

23:57.727 --> 23:58.728
Of course.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.526
All I have to do is calm down.

24:06.862 --> 24:07.821
Just calm down.

24:10.407 --> 24:11.283
Oh, excuse me.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.203
-You okay, Sarge?
-Yeah, yeah.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.707
Just, a-- Just a little indigestion,
that's all. I'll be right out.

24:19.708 --> 24:20.542
It's okay.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.472
Hot. Hot. These dishes are very hot.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.974
-Would you help me, please?
-It's about time.

24:36.433 --> 24:37.642
What took you so long, man?

24:38.018 --> 24:39.895
Did Polly have to go to the bathroom?

24:39.978 --> 24:42.022
-(growls)
-(laughs)

24:43.732 --> 24:45.817
-Tough day.
-Tell me about it.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.031
Oh! Whoa!

24:52.032 --> 24:55.869
Look, you don't ever want
to be running up on me, man.

24:55.952 --> 24:58.747
-Got that?
-What the hell is the matter with you?

24:59.915 --> 25:00.749
Nothing.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.835
You just get away from me.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.053
(knocks)

25:15.555 --> 25:17.516
-WOMAN: Who's there?
-Police officers, ma'am.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.064
Ain't nobody here.

25:24.147 --> 25:25.607
-(window opens)
-The window!

25:29.736 --> 25:31.404
(dog barking)

25:33.114 --> 25:34.991
RENKO: [indistinct]
Get up. Hands above your head.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.535
-Get up!
-...right now. Turn around.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.828
Put your hands behind your back.
Put them behind your back.

25:38.912 --> 25:39.829
Okay, walk. Walk.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.207
The car's registered in your name, ma'am.

25:42.290 --> 25:44.543
I'm just his mother.
I just sign the papers.

25:44.626 --> 25:45.627
It's his car.

25:46.628 --> 25:49.297
J.D., this here is the kid
from the Van Buren sweep.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.591
-What you done now, Parker?
-Nothing.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.593
Ma'am, we have reason to believe
that your son was involved

25:53.677 --> 25:55.929
in the drug related death
of a young boy this morning.

25:56.012 --> 25:57.305
Ten years old or there about.

25:59.849 --> 26:02.686
Ten-year-old? Where's your brother?

26:02.769 --> 26:04.437
You're supposed to be with
your brother this morning.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.982
You gave your brother drugs?
You killed your brother, man?

26:07.065 --> 26:09.317
-What have you done?
-PARKER: I ain't done nothing.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.945
He died all by himself!
I ain't got nothing to do with it!

26:12.028 --> 26:13.697
-Where's my boy?
-Okay.

26:13.780 --> 26:15.323
-Where's my boy?
-Okay, ma'am.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.075
Walk away from it, ma'am.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.953
Get in the car. Get in the car!

26:20.036 --> 26:22.539
Walk away from it. Easy. Get in here.

26:30.964 --> 26:31.881
It's similar.

26:33.466 --> 26:36.845
Uh, you know,
similar to like before the bypass.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.682
Well, it's approximately right...

26:42.726 --> 26:43.852
it's right in the center.

26:45.061 --> 26:47.689
This wouldn't be the same thing, though,
Doc, would it?

26:48.565 --> 26:50.358
I mean, the operation took care of this.

26:52.694 --> 26:53.778
I don't want to come in.

26:54.571 --> 26:57.282
What should I come in for?
The operation took care of me, right?

27:00.827 --> 27:02.245
This is gonna ruin everything.

27:03.872 --> 27:04.873
I was cured.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.757
You weren't kidding about leaving me
with the check, huh, Stan?

27:14.799 --> 27:16.301
I'm sorry, Lucy. I...

27:17.802 --> 27:19.095
I remembered I had to make a phone call.

27:20.347 --> 27:21.973
Patrick said you went out back, so...

27:24.392 --> 27:26.019
The-the guy's a contractor.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.481
I was aggravated with him.

27:31.107 --> 27:31.983
He let me down.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.572
Why don't you let me take you there, Stan?

27:39.240 --> 27:40.075
What do you mean?

27:41.284 --> 27:42.744
Let me take you to the doctor's.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.588
-Lieutenant Goldblume?
-Yeah.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.508
Paul Nichols, literary agent.
We spoke on the phone.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.802
I'm a little busy right now, Mr. Nichols.

27:58.885 --> 28:00.762
I respect that, Lieutenant.

28:00.845 --> 28:03.723
But if you give me five minutes,
I think I can convince you

28:03.807 --> 28:06.476
that I am the man
to represent Steven Merkur's novel.

28:06.851 --> 28:10.230
Not to sound crass,
but your friend's tragic death

28:10.313 --> 28:12.273
created a market for his work.

28:12.899 --> 28:13.733
I don't know.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.861
I mean, promoting the book
through some kind of

28:16.945 --> 28:19.614
grotesque sensationalism is the last thing
Steve would have wanted.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.326
Perhaps, but if the book is as good
as you said on television,

28:23.410 --> 28:26.371
then it doesn't matter
how or why it gets published,

28:26.454 --> 28:27.789
but only that it does

28:27.872 --> 28:30.208
and finds its proper readership.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.255
He doesn't get home till 3:00 a.m.

28:35.338 --> 28:37.674
He's got a girlfriend.
Some stripper named Honey.

28:37.757 --> 28:39.342
I ain't saying the guy is a saint.

28:39.426 --> 28:41.010
Could be having a midlife crisis.

28:41.094 --> 28:44.013
But he sat in here today,
and he cried like a baby.

28:44.597 --> 28:47.559
What happened,
Korea stop exporting stereos?

28:48.226 --> 28:51.438
Peg, listen to what I'm saying.
The man needs you.

28:53.022 --> 28:55.275
Honey sends him little notes

28:55.358 --> 28:58.987
of endearment on heart-shaped paper
and all the words are misspelled.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.156
Maybe he wouldn't be
fooling around with Honey

29:01.239 --> 29:02.615
if he got what he was looking for at home.

29:02.699 --> 29:03.992
What are you saying, it's my fault?

29:04.075 --> 29:06.786
I'm saying it take two
to trash a relationship.

29:07.328 --> 29:08.329
And be honest, Peg.

29:09.330 --> 29:12.709
You want to face the single life again?
Hmm? At your age?

29:14.836 --> 29:18.089
He actually cried, J.D.?

29:18.173 --> 29:19.632
You wouldn't have believed it.

29:22.635 --> 29:25.305
I hate to say it,
but I suddenly miss the jerk.

29:26.973 --> 29:28.349
Go tell him, Peg.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.771
You know, maybe I misjudged you, too, J.D.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.356
Life's full of surprises, sis.

29:40.278 --> 29:43.865
Hi, Doctor, did you get a chance
to read through that file?

29:44.699 --> 29:47.202
Yeah, Stanislav Jab-- Right.

29:50.705 --> 29:52.373
I see. No.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.293
No.

29:58.379 --> 29:59.297
I understand.

29:59.380 --> 30:02.842
Uh, is there a heart specialist
the department consults?

30:03.885 --> 30:05.929
Oren? Dr. Oren at the university?

30:06.554 --> 30:07.806
Okay, great. Thanks.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.774
NEAL: The boy and his mother
are about to be questioned, Chief.

30:17.857 --> 30:20.109
-Little early to be talking charges.
-Problem, Chief?

30:20.193 --> 30:22.028
Uh, just wanted to take a look
at the arrest report

30:22.111 --> 30:23.029
on the boy you brought in.

30:23.112 --> 30:24.781
There's nothing in here
about murder charges.

30:24.864 --> 30:26.324
Just my field report, Captain.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.285
No charges have been brought.

30:29.953 --> 30:31.746
Jones and his mother
are still being questioned.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.166
But if the boy supplied the drugs,
you will press for murder charges?

30:35.250 --> 30:37.544
-You don't want that.
-That boy should be tried for murder.

30:37.627 --> 30:39.420
What kind of a message
are you sending, Captain?

30:39.504 --> 30:42.298
-This is totally unacceptable.
-I'll tell you what's unacceptable.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.843
You and your publicity circus.
You have no right interfering

30:44.926 --> 30:46.553
with my men
while they're performing their duty.

30:46.636 --> 30:49.097
The councilman is simply anxious
to clear up the problem.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.473
-We all are, Frank.
-It's all right, Chief.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.976
I expect nothing more
from Captain Furillo.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.936
He's allowed his precinct
to run completely out of control,

30:55.019 --> 30:56.688
and I intend
to let the people know about it.

30:56.771 --> 30:59.399
I told you, man. I don't deal no drugs,

30:59.482 --> 31:01.734
and I don't know nothing
about how my brother died.

31:02.193 --> 31:05.822
Mm-hmm. Well, you're gonna be looking at
some hard time in juvie, Parker.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.782
Do time in juvie on my head, man.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.868
What about you, Ms. Jones?
You help us?

31:10.159 --> 31:11.911
Do you know who your son's supplier is?

31:12.203 --> 31:14.622
I wish I could help,
but I don't know nothing.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.500
Too bad, 'cause we got Parker's prints

31:17.584 --> 31:19.210
all over the pipe
that was found in the park,

31:19.294 --> 31:22.046
which means he's going away
and you're gonna be charged

31:22.130 --> 31:24.048
with contributing
to the delinquency of a minor.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.843
-That ain't right. I ain't done nothing.
-NEAL: You bought his car.

31:26.926 --> 31:28.803
And there were traces of crack
all over it.

31:29.095 --> 31:30.221
I think the charge is gonna stick.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.226
-I think you ought to tell, Parker.
-Shut up.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.562
Man gave you drugs
that killed your brother.

31:38.104 --> 31:39.689
How you let him get away with that?

31:40.315 --> 31:41.858
-I'll tell him.
-Shut up, I said!

31:41.941 --> 31:43.693
-Hey, huh?
-I tell you

31:43.776 --> 31:45.987
who supplied Parker, you let us go?

31:46.279 --> 31:47.113
You testify in court,

31:47.196 --> 31:49.032
-I think we can help you out.
-No.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.161
Armis. Kenny Armis.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.830
-Good.
-You make me sick!

31:56.998 --> 31:58.958
Man, you know why she's doing this,
don't you?

31:59.167 --> 32:00.710
'Cause she's supplying, too.

32:00.793 --> 32:03.922
She figure you put Armis behind bars,
then she can grab all his customers.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.174
-Right?
-That ain't so. You trash.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.717
You ain't no son of mine!

32:07.800 --> 32:09.260
Family of the year.

32:12.513 --> 32:13.681
We arrested Donatelli.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.809
-They're holding him at the Polk.
-Good work.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.608
Hi.

32:23.691 --> 32:26.319
I seem to notice a lot of people
in interrogation without lawyers.

32:26.402 --> 32:28.488
If certain subjects
have declined representation,

32:28.571 --> 32:29.739
they've done it of their own free will.

32:29.822 --> 32:31.741
Over strenuous objection no doubt.

32:32.825 --> 32:33.660
Excuse me.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.582
We got the name
of the kid's supplier, Captain.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.167
Kenny Armis.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.252
Heard about him before, Captain.
Slippery dude.

32:43.336 --> 32:45.463
-Uses minors to distribute.
-Get a warrant.

32:48.466 --> 32:51.386
MAN: This fella's in the military, huh?
This guy you're moving to?

32:51.719 --> 32:53.930
-Right, uh-huh.
-Where's he stationed?

32:54.013 --> 32:55.598
No offense, but what's it to you?

32:57.934 --> 32:59.936
Nobody makes conversation anymore.

33:00.019 --> 33:01.229
This stuff's good.

33:01.813 --> 33:02.772
Do the business.

33:04.273 --> 33:05.274
I never opened this.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.860
I never touched this from the envelope
since I took it last week.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.195
Go ahead and give it to him.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.280
Five grand, no?

33:11.364 --> 33:13.032
In Mr. Falco's, right.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.451
And this is 32 and a half.

33:15.952 --> 33:18.037
Makes a total of 8,250 total.

33:18.871 --> 33:20.289
Six lids back to you.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.169
The advertising's right, I'm gonna be
seeing you again in a couple of weeks.

33:25.878 --> 33:27.046
(scoffs) That's what he said.

33:27.922 --> 33:31.300
Well, if you can't believe a solider,
who you gonna believe? Am I right?

33:31.634 --> 33:32.760
All done, Tony?

33:33.886 --> 33:35.096
Yeah, I'm on my way.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.393
-Be good, Anthony.
-Mm-hmm.

33:41.894 --> 33:45.273
Now, don't let me get hit in the head,
am I right? On my way to move it.

33:45.857 --> 33:46.691
What do you mean?

33:47.442 --> 33:48.609
Well, I was just making a joke.

33:48.693 --> 33:52.030
I was saying don't let me get robbed
on the way to see this guy.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.198
You'd still owe us the 12,500.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.909
I understand that.
I was just kidding around.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.328
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

33:59.829 --> 34:00.872
I want to make sure

34:00.955 --> 34:02.749
-we understood each other.
-We do.

34:02.832 --> 34:07.003
We're gonna see you back here
at 8:00 tonight with 12,500 bucks.

34:07.587 --> 34:10.590
Now what happens the rest of the day
between now and then,

34:10.673 --> 34:12.091
that's your own private business.

34:12.175 --> 34:14.469
-It has nothing to do with us.
-I understand it, that's right.

34:14.552 --> 34:19.891
Regardless, you get hit in the head,
you get hit with a bomb, 8:00 tonight,

34:19.974 --> 34:23.811
you're gonna be back here
with what you owe, which is 12,500.

34:24.103 --> 34:27.315
-Now do you understand that 100 percent?
-I do.

34:28.399 --> 34:31.611
-I think the man follows then.
-Good.

34:31.694 --> 34:32.528
Okay.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.824
-You all right?
-I'm okay.

34:37.450 --> 34:39.619
-Gonna see you tonight?
-8:00 tonight.

34:39.702 --> 34:41.662
I'm coming back to make everything square.

34:49.837 --> 34:50.838
Police, open up.

34:52.256 --> 34:54.592
KENNY: You welch on a deal
and all you can say is I'm sorry?

34:54.675 --> 34:55.510
(coughs)

34:56.135 --> 34:58.763
-KENNY: Well, get it straight. Gotta go.
-Come in.

34:59.305 --> 35:00.431
Kenny's on the phone.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.684
KENNY: That's right, cops.

35:06.979 --> 35:09.816
-Yeah, I assume you got a warrant?
-Oh, you assume right.

35:09.899 --> 35:10.983
Here, you're under arrest

35:11.067 --> 35:14.195
for sales and distribution
of controlled substances. Take it.

35:14.278 --> 35:15.947
Oh, good,
I'll put this with my collection.

35:16.030 --> 35:17.573
-Come on, let's go.
-Of course.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.283
Always like to please the police.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.995
Want me to water the plants
while you're gone, Ken?

35:23.079 --> 35:25.498
I don't think so, Joan.
And I'll be home before dinner. (smooches)

35:34.215 --> 35:35.299
Hey, man. You're late.

35:35.842 --> 35:37.552
You're looking a little sweaty there, J.

35:37.635 --> 35:40.054
-You coming down with something?
-You watch your mouth.

35:53.609 --> 35:54.610
Uh-uh.

35:55.319 --> 35:56.654
Police officer, John.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.656
Oh, Mick.

35:59.073 --> 36:01.492
Oh, man-man, you don't know
where I'm coming from.

36:01.576 --> 36:02.451
Oh, yes, I do.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.372
Don't even think about it, hairball.
You're busted.

36:07.748 --> 36:09.375
Wrong choice, Mick. Drop the gun.

36:09.458 --> 36:10.501
Eddie, let's get him into your truck.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.378
-What you gonna do, man?
-What do you think?

36:13.212 --> 36:14.881
Mick, I need my stuff, huh.

36:16.382 --> 36:17.967
Oh, but not that bad.

36:27.894 --> 36:28.728
Yeah.

36:29.478 --> 36:32.607
Well, I guess
these are good for something after all.

36:33.691 --> 36:34.525
(exhales)

36:40.072 --> 36:42.867
Face facts, gentlemen,
you have no case against my client.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.995
-Your client is a worm.
-Very hard. I like that.

36:46.078 --> 36:49.290
-Shh, be quiet, Kenny.
-Yeah, Kenny, be real quiet.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.126
We have a statement
from one of your distributors, Kenny.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.463
He gave us time, place,
amount of substance, amount of commission.

36:55.546 --> 36:58.341
(laughs)
Is this your idea of evidence, Captain?

36:58.883 --> 37:00.676
Word of an under aged addict?

37:00.760 --> 37:02.220
We'll let the courts be the judge of that.

37:02.303 --> 37:05.264
How long I got to sit here, Hal?
There's some action at the track--

37:05.348 --> 37:07.558
I got bail.
You'll be home in time for dinner.

37:07.934 --> 37:11.354
Good. 'Cause Joan
is such a genius with the veal.

37:14.982 --> 37:15.816
See you at arraignment.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.112
Sweet guy, huh, Captain?

37:20.196 --> 37:22.740
-It's a weak case, J.D.
-We knew that bringing him in, Captain.

37:22.823 --> 37:24.200
I want it made stronger.

37:24.450 --> 37:26.244
Two of you
are going back to the Van Buren corridor.

37:26.327 --> 37:27.787
As of now, you volunteered for night duty.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.163
We looking for underage dealers?

37:29.247 --> 37:31.666
Well, if Armis is using minors
to deal for him,

37:31.749 --> 37:33.542
some of them have to be operating there.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.419
-Bring them in.
-You got it, Captain.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.298
Feel so hot, Detective.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.051
Like I was plugged into the wall socket.

37:43.135 --> 37:44.387
I need the stuff!

37:45.513 --> 37:47.723
Oh, God, how'd I let myself get like this?

37:48.266 --> 37:50.726
-Hang on, John.
-I mean, it's like a poison.

37:50.810 --> 37:54.939
Even right now with all this shame
I feel inside, letting everybody down.

37:55.022 --> 37:56.148
I still want it.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.652
But I never dealt it, man.

37:59.735 --> 38:02.780
-Mm-mm. No, no, I wouldn't do that.
-I believe you. I believe that.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.448
And I'll stand up for you in court.

38:04.532 --> 38:07.118
You're gonna be okay. You hear me?

38:07.576 --> 38:08.619
Yeah, I hear you.

38:11.247 --> 38:12.123
Stan.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.209
Department turned me down, right?

38:16.085 --> 38:18.045
Because if they didn't, they should have.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.008
I had a warning sign.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.344
I saw the doc. He said it's not unusual.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.722
In fact, he worries
when his patients feel too good.

38:29.390 --> 38:30.224
How serious?

38:31.684 --> 38:32.893
I may need a pacemaker.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.396
I talked to the department's
cardiac specialist.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.231
He wouldn't recommend reinstatement.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.483
I want you to take care
of this right away.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.568
Oh, don't worry.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.946
You know,
I envy those that can do out easy.

38:45.197 --> 38:47.491
Short farewells. No looking back.

38:47.575 --> 38:50.077
It's understandable.
You put your life into this job.

38:51.454 --> 38:52.705
It's time to move on.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.707
-I know you can do it.
-Yeah.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.295
It's not as though
I don't have any options, right?

38:59.378 --> 39:00.296
-Right.
-Right.

39:01.130 --> 39:02.840
Well, if you need a recommendation
for security work,

39:02.923 --> 39:04.550
-just say the word.
-Thanks, Captain.

39:06.469 --> 39:07.470
Thanks for everything.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.936
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

39:16.270 --> 39:18.397
Don't know what you said to Peg, J.D.,
but it worked like a charm,

39:18.481 --> 39:20.733
-This my car?
-Never let it be said

39:21.025 --> 39:23.069
that Wacky Rob is not a man of his word.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.945
Cougar? Fantastic.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.530
-What's that?
-It's your lease.

39:27.948 --> 39:30.868
-My what?
-Best six month rate available, J.D.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.745
And to show you how much
I appreciate your effort,

39:32.828 --> 39:35.122
I'm giving you
an additional ten percent discount,

39:35.206 --> 39:37.041
-straight across the board.
-Oh.

39:37.583 --> 39:41.212
I'm giving Peg the real lowdown
on what a lousy slime you are.

39:41.670 --> 39:44.131
Go ahead, but I think she's feeling
a little too good to worry.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.926
You know,
we had a make-up matinee, she and I.

39:47.676 --> 39:49.136
Besides, what are you gonna tell her?

39:49.220 --> 39:51.055
You sold her out for a new set of wheels?

39:51.138 --> 39:51.972
-(laughs)
-Oh!

39:54.892 --> 39:56.602
Well, you come up with some bread,
brother-in-law,

39:56.685 --> 39:59.146
-you know where to find me.
-Hey, forget it, man. Forget it.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.816
Come on,
he's not worth a board of inquiry.

40:09.073 --> 40:09.907
Norman.

40:10.116 --> 40:13.160
This is a list of warrants
for tonight, Captain.

40:13.244 --> 40:16.831
You think I got to add that dealer's name
or can he just count as persons unknown?

40:16.914 --> 40:18.749
If you know the name, you have to add it.

40:19.375 --> 40:22.753
Listen, is there a chance
of sliding those arrests till tomorrow?

40:23.629 --> 40:26.382
I want to saturate manpower
in the Van Buren corridor tonight.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.886
I got an 8:00 meeting with those shys.
That's when we were gonna take them.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.388
What happens if you just don't show up?

40:32.471 --> 40:35.474
Nuh-uh, then they'll lean
on this Tommy Manfredi,

40:35.558 --> 40:36.767
the guy who vouched for me.

40:37.977 --> 40:41.480
Listen, I'll go there,
I'll tell them, uh--

40:42.106 --> 40:43.649
I'll tell them the deal's stalled.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.235
-I can make it work.
-You sure it's okay?

40:47.153 --> 40:49.113
-Yeah, no problem, Captain.
-Appreciate it.

40:49.196 --> 40:50.656
This guy Wade's
got everything turned upside down.

40:52.616 --> 40:53.534
No problem.

40:58.038 --> 40:59.707
See, if I can show the children

40:59.790 --> 41:02.710
that faith is not something
cold and remote.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.379
It's alive. It's passionate.

41:05.754 --> 41:07.798
I'll bet you convert
a lot of people, Sister.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.385
I'd be happy if that were true.

41:11.719 --> 41:14.555
Believe me,
I've never known a nun to talk like you.

41:16.682 --> 41:18.809
Patrick, you've got to stop doing that.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.311
What?

41:21.562 --> 41:23.147
Building up walls between us.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.274
Oh, I didn't know
I was doing that, Sister.

41:25.357 --> 41:27.485
You talk as if I live
in a different world.

41:27.568 --> 41:31.363
-We're the same.
-But... but you're a nun, Sister.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.074
And what does that mean?

41:34.992 --> 41:37.620
Well, that means, um,
that means you're different.

41:38.579 --> 41:39.413
Why?

41:40.498 --> 41:43.083
-Because--
-Because I wear this habit?

41:43.792 --> 41:47.254
Think of me without this habit.
What do you see?

41:50.633 --> 41:51.467
Faith.

41:52.426 --> 41:54.011
That's the difference.

41:55.387 --> 41:56.931
I'm as mortal as you.

41:57.223 --> 42:00.226
Except that I have been touched
by the divine.

42:01.101 --> 42:03.062
I felt the force of His love.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.691
And I want to share that with you.

42:08.609 --> 42:11.862
I want you to burn with the same fire
that I feel inside me.

42:15.032 --> 42:15.866
Okay.

42:17.868 --> 42:19.203
Oh, Patrick,

42:20.120 --> 42:21.872
I'm gonna make you my project.

42:22.581 --> 42:24.375
I'm gonna make you grow larger

42:24.458 --> 42:26.835
than you ever dreamed
it was possible to grow.

42:29.129 --> 42:30.589
-In spirit.
-Yes.

42:31.757 --> 42:33.467
-Will you let me do that?
-Sure.

42:33.551 --> 42:34.927
Oh, thank you.

42:36.845 --> 42:39.473
-And thank you for a lovely dinner.
-You're welcome.

42:41.141 --> 42:42.309
Good night, Patrick.

42:43.352 --> 42:44.270
Good night, Sister.

42:47.064 --> 42:50.025
(door opens, closes)

42:50.109 --> 42:52.152
-(pool balls striking)
-(music playing)

42:52.236 --> 42:54.863
(people chattering)

42:54.947 --> 42:57.074
So, Steve's book
might get published after all.

42:58.117 --> 43:00.160
-That's terrific, Henry.
-Yeah.

43:00.661 --> 43:02.621
Well, let's not get too excited here.

43:02.705 --> 43:05.124
I wonder if I did the right thing
giving the manuscript to Nichols.

43:05.708 --> 43:07.209
Sure you did. What's wrong about it?

43:09.044 --> 43:11.130
On your show,
I said Steven's writing was good.

43:13.632 --> 43:14.800
But you don't think it is.

43:17.303 --> 43:18.554
Maybe with revisions.

43:18.637 --> 43:20.389
Don't tear yourself up about it.

43:21.098 --> 43:23.809
Why don't you let the literary
agent decide? That's his job.

43:23.892 --> 43:25.728
You did what Steven would have wanted.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.314
You're giving his work a chance.

43:29.648 --> 43:31.191
This whole thing has gotten to me.

43:31.650 --> 43:33.694
Steven's death. Handling the manuscript.

43:36.488 --> 43:37.323
You.

43:39.575 --> 43:40.409
Detective...

43:42.536 --> 43:43.454
you need a break.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.040
I do believe you're right.

43:46.498 --> 43:47.333
Come on.

43:48.917 --> 43:50.294
(chuckles)

43:57.176 --> 43:59.762
So do you think I should have taken
a punch at him?

44:00.304 --> 44:01.555
-What?
-The councilman.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.766
That guy Wade
at the Van Buren corridor today.

44:03.849 --> 44:06.352
-Do you think I should have--
-Renko, come on.

44:06.727 --> 44:08.896
Well, I mean,
he's just going on and on about

44:08.979 --> 44:12.566
how, you know, we do our job wrong
and how we're not able

44:12.650 --> 44:14.693
to realize that people
are dying out there.

44:14.777 --> 44:16.320
-Renko.
-What?

44:17.613 --> 44:19.031
-Let's get another beer.
-Yeah.

44:19.573 --> 44:22.951
Oh, man, 15 a rock? That's sky.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.453
What it be, bro?

44:25.245 --> 44:27.247
Well, I need my cool, man.

44:27.331 --> 44:28.707
Yo, Mouse, you got some inventory?

44:28.791 --> 44:30.334
I'm doing a thing here, man.

44:30.417 --> 44:32.586
I got a rich honky
wants to do some serious weight.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.421
Hey, look, man. We doing business here.

44:34.505 --> 44:37.091
You shut up. Mouse, kick in with me

44:37.174 --> 44:39.468
and we'll be spending the day
at the club tomorrow.

44:39.551 --> 44:41.845
-Split 50-50?
-Yo.

44:41.929 --> 44:44.098
-(chuckles) Catch you later, small time.
-Later.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.353
-Yo, where you going?
-Hey, got to split, man.

44:49.436 --> 44:51.355
I saw what happened back there,
they shut you down.

44:51.438 --> 44:53.607
Look, you want to get off,
you need to be talking to me,

44:53.691 --> 44:55.651
-'cause I got choice smoke.
-Yeah, later, man.

44:55.734 --> 44:57.444
Dig, my man, I'm new in the neigh.

44:57.528 --> 44:59.905
Number two and working hard
to be number one.

44:59.988 --> 45:02.282
I got the best candy
at rock bottom prices.

45:02.366 --> 45:03.867
(gunshot)

45:05.828 --> 45:07.830
Police! Drop it!

45:07.913 --> 45:09.790
Drop the gun! Now!

45:10.666 --> 45:11.792
Turn around slow.

45:15.587 --> 45:17.631
-Councilman Wade!
-I called for backup.

45:18.090 --> 45:19.216
Oh, man.

45:20.050 --> 45:20.968
He was pulling a gun.

45:23.762 --> 45:24.972
It was a citizen's arrest.

45:25.806 --> 45:26.640
Tell him, Robin!

45:29.143 --> 45:29.977
Oh, my God.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.357
I don't see any gun, Neal.

45:37.651 --> 45:39.111
It was self-defense, I tell you.

45:44.074 --> 45:47.327
I'm confused. I don't know
what I'm supposed to make of this here.

45:47.411 --> 45:48.954
I ran into a problem, Mr. Falco.

45:49.037 --> 45:51.665
I don't believe in problems!

45:51.957 --> 45:53.500
I don't believe in lateness!

45:53.751 --> 45:58.213
Somebody tells me 8:00,
I want to see my freakin' money at 8:00.

46:00.174 --> 46:01.717
What's this you're showing me?

46:02.426 --> 46:04.762
Just want you to see
that I didn't give him the drugs.

46:05.179 --> 46:07.097
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

46:07.473 --> 46:09.475
I mean, you're not out the drugs, sir.
I just wanted--

46:09.558 --> 46:11.310
Look, what did I tell you before?

46:11.518 --> 46:14.146
Did I tell you
I was interested in one thing?

46:15.230 --> 46:18.817
-You said 8:00.
-8:00, I want to see my freakin' money!

46:19.610 --> 46:21.695
-Is that what I said?
-I'm trying to explain to you.

46:21.779 --> 46:23.447
I don't want you to explain!

46:23.781 --> 46:25.657
That's not what I loaned you
the money for.

46:26.325 --> 46:27.701
Teddy, these things happen sometimes.

46:27.785 --> 46:29.828
To you guys. Not to me.

46:30.412 --> 46:32.790
Look, the guy promised, he swore to me

46:32.873 --> 46:35.793
tomorrow morning at 10:00,
he was gonna have the money.

46:35.876 --> 46:37.294
Why should I believe that?

46:38.086 --> 46:39.838
Did he promise he was gonna have it
at 8:00 tonight?

46:39.922 --> 46:42.090
-Mr. Falco.
-Is that what he promised you?

46:42.174 --> 46:43.884
Yes or no, is that what he said?

46:44.927 --> 46:47.179
Look, I want to get one thing
straight with you.

46:47.554 --> 46:50.224
See, your agreement with him
is your agreement with him.

46:50.307 --> 46:54.102
I have nothing to do with it.
But you have an agreement with me.

46:56.396 --> 46:58.232
Now what can I do to find something

46:58.315 --> 47:00.901
to impress upon you
that I take this seriously?

47:01.610 --> 47:03.862
-I take it seriously, too.
-Do you?

47:04.738 --> 47:06.698
Do you take that seriously?

47:06.782 --> 47:09.034
I swear. I swear, Mr. Falco,

47:09.117 --> 47:10.786
I was sick when the guy
didn't come up with the money.

47:10.869 --> 47:11.703
All right!

47:16.959 --> 47:17.918
I believe you.

47:20.170 --> 47:21.463
(scoffs)

47:21.547 --> 47:22.840
Would you shake hands with me?

47:25.050 --> 47:27.386
I'm grateful, Mr. Falco.
I'm grateful for you

47:27.469 --> 47:29.429
-giving me another chance.
-Shake hands.

47:31.390 --> 47:32.224
(groans)

47:34.142 --> 47:36.311
-Oh, my God!
-TEDDY: It's cheap.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.981
Believe me, that's a cheap lesson for you.

47:39.398 --> 47:41.400
I'm you, I stick this in an envelope.

47:41.733 --> 47:46.363
You hear me? Put this in an envelope
and on the outside, you write your lesson.

47:46.989 --> 47:49.074
The fellas always get their piece.

47:49.575 --> 47:50.409
All right?

47:51.243 --> 47:52.369
You gonna remember?

47:52.911 --> 47:54.496
I'm gonna remember.

47:55.205 --> 47:56.206
(groans)

48:03.088 --> 48:06.091
(closing theme playing)
