Guys, Pauly--
he's on his way,

15:08.174 --> 15:10.074

when he's getting here.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.143

15:12.212 --> 15:13.878
I have a surprise
about tomorrow.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.280
- What's that?
- Oh, God.

15:15.348 --> 15:19.217
- Okay, it's going to be
the baptism before the baptism.

15:19.286 --> 15:22.253
- What in the hell
is going on--

15:22.322 --> 15:24.455
or what in the heaven
is going on?

15:24.524 --> 15:25.723
Sorry about that.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.626
- Because we couldn't
locate my sacraments,

15:28.695 --> 15:32.597
they wouldn't baptize Romeo
if I didn't redo my baptism,

15:32.666 --> 15:34.599
and we're gonna do it tomorrow.

15:34.668 --> 15:37.068
- You're 55.
Like, you didn't get baptized?

15:37.137 --> 15:39.337
- And we're gonna do it
in a very big way.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.872
- Wait.

15:40.941 --> 15:43.708
Do you mean
Romeo's getting baptized?

15:43.777 --> 15:44.842
What?

15:44.911 --> 15:46.778
- I got a big food tent,
I got balloons.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.012
- Oh, my God.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.281
- We're gonna do it here,
we're gonna have a--

15:50.350 --> 15:52.583
I guess a dunk tank
of some sort.

15:52.652 --> 15:53.818
- Oh, my God.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.620
- Is it holy water?
- It's gonna be holy.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.722
it's gonna be called
The Blessification.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.158

one of the biggest surprises--

- Uncle Nino's coming to town.

- Oh, no.
- No way.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.702
- [laughing] Look at Vinny!

16:10.770 --> 16:12.670
- He is the least holy guy.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.572

will strike down

Mike is asking me
to be his godmother,

17:02.956 --> 17:05.957
but I'm also slightly confused
because I'm younger than Mike

17:06.026 --> 17:08.993
and I thought your godparent
has to be older.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.495
