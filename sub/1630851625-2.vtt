10:49.615 --> 10:53.786
My husband was very worried
because he's a builder,

10:53.853 --> 10:57.323
and he thought
it was to do with the mold.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.192
<i>- To me, it was obvious</i>
<i>when I went to the house,</i>

11:00.292 --> 11:02.862
<i>in this gorgeous</i>
<i>picture window.</i>

11:02.962 --> 11:05.031
I'm looking around
the frame of that window

11:05.131 --> 11:10.002
and you visibly see mold
on the side,

11:10.069 --> 11:12.171
<i>across the top,</i>
<i>across the bottom,</i>

11:12.238 --> 11:15.541
<i>and I look over to the French</i>
<i>doors and there's mold there.</i>

11:15.641 --> 11:17.877
<i>I don't think there's</i>
<i>any other explanation</i>

11:17.977 --> 11:19.578
<i>for their death.</i>

11:19.679 --> 11:22.214
<i>- All of the symptoms,</i>
<i>disorientation,</i>

11:22.314 --> 11:24.750
<i>feeling sick,</i>
<i>dreadful headaches,</i>

11:24.850 --> 11:30.156
all these things come from
inhaling spores from mold.

11:30.222 --> 11:32.391
<i>- Sharon Murphy</i>
<i>claims she discovered</i>

11:32.491 --> 11:35.227
<i>deadly mold hiding</i>
<i>in the walls of their mansion.</i>

11:35.327 --> 11:38.698
<i>Just look at what we found</i>
<i>at Brittany's home today.</i>

11:38.764 --> 11:42.068
- I know that there
were rumors that toxic mold

11:42.168 --> 11:44.403
may have played a role
in Brittany's death

11:44.503 --> 11:46.906
and possibly the death
of her husband.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.608
But on my autopsy,

11:49.709 --> 11:53.045
<i>I didn't see any evidence</i>
<i>of mold in her lungs</i>

11:53.112 --> 11:56.182
<i>or any other organs because</i>
<i>you can see the hyphae,</i>

11:56.248 --> 12:00.086
<i>which are little strands of</i>
<i>mold or the fruiting bodies.</i>

12:00.186 --> 12:03.723
<i>- I told Sharon I would get</i>
<i>somebody from County Health</i>

12:03.789 --> 12:06.192
<i>to come up</i>
<i>and they'd check the house.</i>

12:06.258 --> 12:08.561
<i>And then I got a call</i>
<i>from her attorney</i>

12:08.627 --> 12:11.030
who said Sharon doesn't want
to give any access,

12:11.097 --> 12:13.532
and she's selling
the house anyway.

12:13.599 --> 12:15.901
Just stay away.

12:15.968 --> 12:19.605
<i>- New shocking allegations</i>
<i>coming from her father,</i>

12:19.705 --> 12:21.474
<i>who says she was poisoned.</i>

12:21.574 --> 12:24.543
<i>And Murphy's father, Angelo</i>
<i>Bertolotti, joining us now.</i>

12:24.610 --> 12:26.979
Angelo, do you
suspect somebody?

12:27.079 --> 12:31.984
- Yeah, I do really, but I'd
rather not speak about that.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.086
I feel she was poisoned.

12:34.153 --> 12:36.288
<i>There's no question</i>
<i>about that.</i>

12:36.388 --> 12:39.125
And I feel she was murdered.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.794
<i>- Once the two of them</i>
<i>had died of the same cause,</i>

12:41.894 --> 12:44.964
<i>Brittany's dad</i>
<i>reached out to me.</i>

12:45.064 --> 12:49.802
He was sure that
someone had done it.

12:49.902 --> 12:53.272
<i>- Angelo Bertolotti</i>
<i>lived down in Florida</i>

12:53.339 --> 12:56.308
and ran a string
of nightclubs.

12:56.408 --> 13:01.313
- Sharon, Brittany's mom,
really does not like Angelo.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.315
She said that he only
came around

13:03.415 --> 13:04.817
when she started making money.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.685
- He says, "I was involved
with the mob.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.988
I wasn't very involved
in my marriage."

13:09.088 --> 13:12.825
<i>- Angelo was actually banned</i>
<i>from ever seeing his daughter</i>

13:12.925 --> 13:17.163
at the gravesite multiple times
until he was able to prove

13:17.263 --> 13:20.533
he was the biological father
of Brittany Murphy.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.967
That's horrible.

13:22.034 --> 13:24.003
- Take two.

13:24.103 --> 13:25.871
<i>- I'm Wendy Abrahamson,</i>

13:25.971 --> 13:28.040
and I was a fan of Brittany

13:28.140 --> 13:31.877
and the best friend
of her father Angelo.

13:31.977 --> 13:36.348
<i>So her dad, he needed help</i>
<i>to find her grave,</i>

13:36.448 --> 13:40.052
<i>and so some of the fans said,</i>
<i>"Oh, we're gonna help."</i>

13:40.152 --> 13:41.821
We just became really close.

13:41.887 --> 13:45.891
Of course, that common
denominator of Brittany

13:45.991 --> 13:50.062
<i>started it and then we were</i>
<i>just best friends.</i>

13:50.162 --> 13:52.331
And of course, he thought
it was really strange

13:52.398 --> 13:58.337
that the mother, his ex-wife,
was perfectly fine.

13:58.404 --> 14:01.640
And that the married couple,
much younger than her,

14:01.707 --> 14:03.075
were both dead.

14:03.175 --> 14:06.812
These are things
that nobody has seen.

14:06.879 --> 14:09.181
We went, of course,
to the coroner's office

14:09.248 --> 14:13.986
to obtain the hair samples
and have those tested.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.556
<i>- Ed Winter says his office</i>
<i>did forward toxicology samples</i>

14:17.656 --> 14:20.559
<i>to a private lab hired</i>
<i>by the late actress's father.</i>

14:20.659 --> 14:23.195
<i>The private analysis</i>
<i>states Brittany Murphy</i>

14:23.262 --> 14:26.665
<i>had high concentrations of ten</i>
<i>heavy metals in her system</i>

14:26.732 --> 14:29.168
<i>and may have been</i>
<i>intentionally poison.</i>

14:29.235 --> 14:34.406
- I received a call, an email
from Angelo Bertolotti.

14:34.506 --> 14:39.245
I can understand him asking,

14:39.345 --> 14:43.282
"What are you telling me,
my 32-year-old daughter,

14:43.382 --> 14:47.620
she just died like that
from pneumonia and anemia?"

14:47.720 --> 14:51.190
<i>He then said he had gotten</i>
<i>hold of a toxicology report</i>

14:51.257 --> 14:52.758
<i>on a sample of hair,</i>

14:52.858 --> 14:56.061
<i>and it showed heavy levels</i>
<i>of heavy metals.</i>

14:56.128 --> 14:59.031
I've had cases like that,
fascinating cases,

14:59.098 --> 15:02.201
one with a woman
who was repeatedly poisoning

15:02.268 --> 15:04.136
her husband with thallium.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.305
I'm not unfamiliar with that.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.107
<i>- Heavy metals</i>
<i>are commonly found</i>

15:08.207 --> 15:09.608
<i>in rat and insect killers.</i>

15:09.708 --> 15:11.110
<i>They can cause the symptoms</i>

15:11.210 --> 15:13.379
<i>Murphy experienced</i>
<i>before her death.</i>

15:13.445 --> 15:17.149
<i>- I absolutely, positively</i>
<i>thinks she was poisoned, yes.</i>

15:17.249 --> 15:20.052
I'm calling for her
to be exhumed.

15:20.119 --> 15:23.322
- You know, Angelo was
in the press quite a bit.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.157
And they were
putting stuff out there,

15:25.257 --> 15:26.825
<i>like she poisoned them.</i>

15:26.926 --> 15:28.794
<i>She's responsible</i>
<i>for their deaths.</i>

15:28.894 --> 15:30.596
<i>So what happens?</i>

15:30.663 --> 15:32.831
<i>You got a grieving mom who now</i>
<i>becomes a murder suspect.</i>

15:32.932 --> 15:34.934
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>
<i>I mean, it's crazy.</i>

15:35.000 --> 15:38.437
<i>- It was just magazine covers</i>
<i>and salacious headlines,</i>

15:38.504 --> 15:40.172
and it became this circus.

15:40.272 --> 15:43.842
So that's when the conspiracy
theories go into overdrive.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.978
- Like, maybe her mother
could have had something

15:46.078 --> 15:48.314
to do with it,
just speculation.

15:48.414 --> 15:51.951
- It was a plan from
the beginning for both of them

15:52.017 --> 15:54.453
to take her money
after she died.

15:54.520 --> 15:58.290
And the mom
got the last laugh.

15:58.357 --> 16:00.859
- I would never put two
and two together,

16:00.960 --> 16:04.163
but these days and age,
mothers, you know,

16:04.263 --> 16:08.100
they take out their kids
all the time.

16:08.167 --> 16:13.005
<i>- Brittany and Sharon were as</i>
<i>close as two people could be.</i>

16:13.105 --> 16:17.343
Maybe Sharon
made some mistakes.

16:18.277 --> 16:22.481
But I know that she loved
that girl wildly.

16:23.449 --> 16:26.018
<i>- Never for a minute</i>
<i>did I ever believe</i>

16:26.118 --> 16:28.954
<i>that Sharon Murphy</i>
<i>was responsible</i>

16:29.021 --> 16:30.656
<i>for those</i>
<i>two young people dying.</i>

16:30.723 --> 16:33.192
I would never believe it.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.861
Not for a millisecond.

16:35.961 --> 16:40.966
- Initially, when I was given
this private laboratory report,

16:41.033 --> 16:42.801
I said, "Oh, my God.
What is this?"

16:42.868 --> 16:46.672
And then I looked
carefully and saw

16:46.739 --> 16:49.041
that this was not
a case of poisoning.

16:49.141 --> 16:52.711
The heavy metals were found
in the hair, not in the roots.

16:52.811 --> 16:57.416
Heavy metals take a while
to be absorbed from the blood.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.685
<i>In order to be in the hair,</i>

16:59.752 --> 17:01.854
<i>they got to be picked up</i>
<i>by the hair root,</i>

17:01.920 --> 17:03.856
<i>and then they got to grow out.</i>

17:03.922 --> 17:08.560
These metals had to have come
from hairsprays, hair dyes,

17:08.660 --> 17:10.329
and things of that nature.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.031
They are not
in her bloodstream.

17:12.097 --> 17:13.532
They are in her hair.

17:13.599 --> 17:18.103
Did she die because
someone poisoned her?

17:18.203 --> 17:19.705
No.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.441
<i>- There were elevated levels</i>
<i>of things like aluminum</i>

17:22.541 --> 17:24.843
or one or two other things,
but it's hair dye.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.578
That's what does it.

17:26.678 --> 17:29.615
<i>And Brittany has dyed her hair</i>
<i>many different times.</i>

17:29.715 --> 17:33.585
And I didn't see any evidence
of any type of poison.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.587
<i>- There is no question</i>
<i>in my mind</i>

17:35.687 --> 17:37.256
<i>about the cause of death.</i>

17:37.356 --> 17:40.092
So this is
a 32-year-old woman.

17:40.192 --> 17:44.263
I don't know the bankroll
of her and her husband,

17:44.363 --> 17:46.598
<i>but I assume</i>
<i>that they had money.</i>

17:46.698 --> 17:50.436
<i>And yet they lived as if</i>
<i>they were peasants in squalor.</i>

17:50.536 --> 17:53.405
<i>To develop an anemia</i>
<i>of this nature,</i>

17:53.472 --> 17:55.140
<i>she was not eating.</i>

17:55.240 --> 17:57.409
<i>How did all of this develop?</i>

17:57.476 --> 17:59.278
<i>That's the fascinating</i>
<i>question.</i>

17:59.378 --> 18:01.747
This is where you got to bring
in the forensic psychiatrist

18:01.814 --> 18:05.551
and see if he can dig up
enough information about her

18:05.617 --> 18:07.653
<i>and her husband Simon Monjack</i>

18:07.753 --> 18:10.756
<i>to try to answer</i>
<i>that question.</i>

18:17.596 --> 18:19.798
- That was during a little dip
she was having

18:19.898 --> 18:21.266
that he came along.

18:21.333 --> 18:25.838
And I think that's
where her judgment

18:25.938 --> 18:29.074
was muddled and desperate,

18:29.141 --> 18:31.610
and she became prey to things

18:31.677 --> 18:34.012
that she thought
would help her.

18:36.014 --> 18:39.485
<i>[tense music]</i>

18:39.585 --> 18:42.921
<i>- I feel like what brought</i>
<i>Brittany Murphy's career down</i>

18:42.988 --> 18:47.292
<i>is a perfect storm of getting</i>
<i>cast in the wrong movies</i>

18:47.359 --> 18:49.128
<i>and her personal life.</i>

18:49.194 --> 18:53.799
Mid 2000s, the biggest rumors
that I was hearing

18:53.866 --> 18:56.301
and not reporting
were about drugs.

18:56.368 --> 18:57.669
- Do we read them?

18:57.769 --> 19:00.839
No, we wait.
Okay.

19:00.939 --> 19:02.674
<i>- I remember her</i>
<i>as a presenter</i>

19:02.774 --> 19:05.444
at the 2003
Independent Spirit Awards,

19:05.511 --> 19:07.546
where her assignment
was to read the names

19:07.646 --> 19:08.847
of five nominees,

19:08.947 --> 19:10.849
open an envelope,
and read the winner.

19:10.949 --> 19:13.152
She kept trying to read
every nominee as the winner.

19:13.218 --> 19:15.187
<i>And when she arrived</i>
<i>triumphantly</i>

19:15.287 --> 19:16.889
<i>at the real winner,</i>

19:16.989 --> 19:19.858
<i>she inspired no confidence</i>
<i>that she had it right.</i>

19:19.958 --> 19:25.030
- America, just one moment,
please.

19:25.130 --> 19:26.532
audience: No!

19:26.632 --> 19:28.233
For crying out stinking loud,

19:28.333 --> 19:30.235
please tell me
when you're going to drop it.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.970
Okay.
And the winner is...

19:32.037 --> 19:34.072
audience: No!

19:36.642 --> 19:40.245
- Brittany Murphy, around
the beginning of my career,

19:40.345 --> 19:45.317
was talked about a lot.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.386
<i>I first started hearing rumors</i>

19:47.486 --> 19:50.522
<i>shortly after her split</i>
<i>from Ashton Kutcher,</i>

19:50.589 --> 19:53.725
<i>rumors about her just being</i>
<i>impossible to deal with,</i>

19:53.825 --> 19:58.063
<i>whereas Ashton was</i>
<i>the golden boy of Hollywood.</i>

19:58.163 --> 20:02.901
Ultimately, you can only
keep things quiet for so long.

20:03.001 --> 20:05.370
When it starts
to get out there,

20:05.437 --> 20:09.575
<i>then you start to develop</i>
<i>a reputation.</i>

20:09.675 --> 20:13.178
- Perez Hilton didn't get
to be Perez Hilton

20:13.245 --> 20:15.914
by writing nice stories
about celebrities.

20:16.014 --> 20:18.684
He was writing doodles
on their photos.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.619
<i>Brittany Murphy,</i>
<i>"Is she pill popping?"</i>

20:20.719 --> 20:22.754
<i>"Is she anorexic?"</i>
<i>"Is she bulimic?"</i>

20:22.854 --> 20:27.426
- I remember she called me
crying and said,

20:27.526 --> 20:29.094
"Can you call my manager?"

20:29.194 --> 20:32.864
Who was a very, very,
very big manager at the time.

20:32.931 --> 20:34.800
"He thinks I'm on drugs."

20:34.900 --> 20:38.604
<i>I know that hurt her deeply.</i>

20:38.704 --> 20:40.639
<i>- You were kind of nasty</i>
<i>at times.</i>

20:40.739 --> 20:42.107
- I was more than nasty.

20:42.207 --> 20:45.277
I--I didn't even view
Brittany Murphy

20:45.377 --> 20:49.581
or any of the celebrities
that I covered as real people.

20:49.648 --> 20:51.483
They were characters to me.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.818
It was almost like a way

20:52.918 --> 20:56.588
to disassociate myself
from my actions,

20:56.655 --> 20:58.457
from what I was writing
and saying.

20:58.557 --> 21:00.425
"Oh, this isn't real,

21:00.492 --> 21:03.629
and also Perez
is a character."

21:03.729 --> 21:06.131
I would tell all these things
to myself

21:06.231 --> 21:09.268
to help me sleep at night.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.271
<i>If you're at a point</i>
<i>in your life</i>

21:12.337 --> 21:14.740
<i>where your career</i>
<i>is struggling,</i>

21:14.806 --> 21:18.577
<i>your personal life</i>
<i>is also struggling,</i>

21:18.644 --> 21:23.415
<i>you might be drawn</i>
<i>to the wrong people.</i>

21:23.482 --> 21:26.985
[indistinct chatter]

21:27.085 --> 21:28.587
- Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa!

21:28.654 --> 21:30.489
- Brittany, can we get
a fashion shot?

21:30.589 --> 21:31.990
<i>- She was an open vessel.</i>

21:32.090 --> 21:35.327
<i>If she trusted you,</i>
<i>she let you in.</i>

21:35.427 --> 21:38.430
<i>He saw her coming</i>
<i>a mile away.</i>

21:38.497 --> 21:41.366
<i>She was pure, trusting,</i>

21:41.466 --> 21:45.837

52:52.969 --> 52:55.739

<i>Brittany Murphy,</i>

52:55.839 --> 52:57.974
he allowed her to die

52:58.041 --> 53:01.545
because he did not get her
to the doctor and get her help,

53:01.645 --> 53:05.882
and I believe that he did
the same thing to himself.

53:05.982 --> 53:08.318
Knowing that he needed
medical treatment,

53:08.385 --> 53:11.254
he didn't get it and he died.

53:11.354 --> 53:15.725
<i>He would rather be dead</i>

It ultimately is like

It's just--it really

53:30.407 --> 53:34.344
<i>It's just very simple,</i>
<i>a predator targeting someone</i>

53:34.411 --> 53:35.845

53:35.912 --> 53:38.281
<i>It was the perfect storm.</i>

53:38.381 --> 53:40.450
<i>- The cause of death</i>
<i>is not a mystery.</i>

53:40.550 --> 53:44.254
The mystery is why
didn't somebody catch it.

53:44.354 --> 53:46.723
Had they taken her to
the doctor a few days before,

53:46.790 --> 53:49.593
she'd still be alive.

53:54.631 --> 53:56.900
<i>You just have</i>

53:59.436 --> 54:01.204
- Why do you just want
to settle for,

54:01.271 --> 54:04.808
"She died of pneumonia,
oh, well"?

54:04.908 --> 54:07.744
It just doesn't make sense.

54:07.811 --> 54:10.146
- Her death was not accidental,

54:10.247 --> 54:12.115
and her husband's
was not accidental.

54:12.215 --> 54:14.884
I believe they both
were targeted.

54:14.951 --> 54:18.255
- I think that their autopsies
were forged.

54:18.321 --> 54:19.456
- Something happened.

54:19.556 --> 54:21.625
Someone must have
bribed someone.

54:25.562 --> 54:28.732
- No, it just--it just
doesn't sound right.

54:28.798 --> 54:30.900
It doesn't even sound
like it adds up.

54:30.967 --> 54:33.937
It just--I'm sorry.
It don't add up.
