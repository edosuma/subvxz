00:00.203 --> 00:02.013
Previously
on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:02.047 --> 00:05.085
For a second there, you were
a lot like my big sister.

00:05.183 --> 00:06.751
Where does she live?
What does she do?

00:06.785 --> 00:09.720
- Details!
- Well, she died a while back.

00:09.755 --> 00:15.326
If you do this, anyone you
tell will be in grave danger.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.661
I figured it out.
Whenever I get hurt...

00:17.696 --> 00:20.264
- Ow! Oh, they got me!
- Claudia feels the pain.

00:20.298 --> 00:22.533
Now, you and I both know that
taking myself off the metronome

00:22.567 --> 00:24.869
might be the only way
to keep Claudia safe.

00:24.903 --> 00:25.970
I want you to find

00:26.004 --> 00:28.939
a certain artifact
before it finds me.

00:30.308 --> 00:32.843
But what does...
what does Brother Adrian want?

00:32.878 --> 00:34.812
- It's none of your business.
- Actually, dude made it

00:34.846 --> 00:37.915
our business when he unleashed
crazy Alice and Fisher's marbles

00:37.949 --> 00:39.817
- back into the world.
- Yeah, and when he almost

00:39.851 --> 00:43.287
- buried Steve and Claudia alive.
- Which is why I don't wanna put

00:43.321 --> 00:47.625
any of you in any more danger.
Additionally, we have a ping.

00:47.659 --> 00:50.161
One Leonard Bukowski.
He checked into a hospital

00:50.195 --> 00:53.931
in Dalton, West Virginia.
He had a rust-like rash

00:53.965 --> 00:57.868
covering his face and arm,
coughing up blood, and particles

00:57.903 --> 01:00.438
- of iron oxide.
- Rusting, huh?

01:00.472 --> 01:03.974
Huh, maybe a witch
left him out in the rain.

01:04.009 --> 01:06.510
Or...or...or
this is really serious

01:06.545 --> 01:08.946
- and I should stop making jokes.
- Yeah, there's a thought.

01:08.980 --> 01:12.583
All right, a little
light reading for the plane.

01:12.617 --> 01:15.186
No-no-no, no!
I see what you're doing, Artie.

01:15.220 --> 01:17.588
- We need to talk...
- A man is rusting

01:17.622 --> 01:20.858
in West Virginia.
You have lives to save. Go!

01:20.892 --> 01:23.494
You know, one of these days,
there won't be a ping,

01:23.528 --> 01:25.563
and you'll actually have
to tell us things.

01:25.597 --> 01:27.565
[Snaps] Oh, darn,
that was last Tuesday.

01:27.599 --> 01:28.566
- Uh...
- Go!

01:28.600 --> 01:33.471
Go, go, go! Go!
[Remote beeps]

01:33.505 --> 01:36.774
[Sighs]
So, let's talk Brother Adrian.

01:36.808 --> 01:39.376
- Oh, dear God help me.
- What exactly does this brother

01:39.411 --> 01:41.278
want you to do?
Convert?

01:41.313 --> 01:43.314
Don't shave your head.
That's not a good look for you.

01:43.348 --> 01:45.116
You either.
Besides, you've got way bigger

01:45.150 --> 01:46.584
- fish to fry.
- Like?

01:46.618 --> 01:49.954
Like getting Steve
off Maelzel's metronome.

01:49.988 --> 01:52.656
[Thudding]

01:52.691 --> 01:54.859
Oh, you keep the metronome
in there.

01:54.893 --> 01:56.093
- That's so comforting.
- Mmm.

01:56.128 --> 01:58.028
[Slam]

01:58.063 --> 01:59.463
So have you heard back
from Germany?

01:59.498 --> 02:01.966
Yes. Uh, one of the
descendants of Robert Schumann

02:02.000 --> 02:04.602
the composer, he confirms
that Schumann owned

02:04.636 --> 02:06.303
- the metronome in the 1830s.
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

02:06.338 --> 02:09.139
Can you hang on a sec, Siri?
Do we even know the risks

02:09.174 --> 02:11.842
of doing this, be...before
we try any wacky plans?

02:11.877 --> 02:13.511
I thought
that you wanted this, too.

02:13.545 --> 02:15.446
Yeah, I want the version
where you don't die again.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.115
What's the big rush?

02:18.150 --> 02:20.751
- Dyahh! Okay, made your point.
- Yes.

02:20.785 --> 02:22.553
Uh, Schumann tried to
kill himself in 1833,

02:22.587 --> 02:24.688
but Clara Wieck...
fiancee...

02:24.723 --> 02:27.258
she kept him alive
via the metronome,

02:27.292 --> 02:29.460
which, sadly,
also drove him insane.

02:29.494 --> 02:32.997
- Super.
- Yes, in 1839, Schumann

02:33.031 --> 02:35.733
got free of the metronome,
and he wrote:

02:35.767 --> 02:37.401
"To live free
of this heart,

02:37.435 --> 02:39.703
"one must first find
one's own;

02:39.738 --> 02:43.307
and make a pure start,
from whence one comes."

02:43.341 --> 02:45.476
From whence one comes?
New Jersey?

02:45.510 --> 02:46.977
It's probably
where you were born.

02:47.012 --> 02:49.246
- You were born at home, right?
- See? It's a riddle.

02:49.281 --> 02:50.714
Go solve it!
[Remote beeps]

02:50.749 --> 02:52.449
- There has to be another way.
- There isn't.

02:52.484 --> 02:57.154
Go! Fly! Be free, before
you go insane like Schumann.

03:03.495 --> 03:05.496
Hello, Arthur.

03:05.530 --> 03:09.533
Very clever.
I barely even saw the screen.

03:09.568 --> 03:12.169
Now, let's talk
about Brother Adrian.

03:12.204 --> 03:16.340
I...I...I don't know what HG
may have told you...

03:16.374 --> 03:17.641
About Brother Adrian?

03:17.676 --> 03:19.443
Or you using
Magellan's Astrolabe

03:19.477 --> 03:21.011
to turn back time?

03:21.046 --> 03:22.379
[Sighs]

03:22.414 --> 03:25.849
Ever since Mr. Sykes
tried to destroy the Warehouse,

03:25.884 --> 03:28.686
I've known that something
had altered time.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.222
And that something
appears to be you.

03:31.256 --> 03:33.290
Arthur, how could you take

03:33.325 --> 03:35.793
such a risk with
so formidable an artifact?

03:35.827 --> 03:38.062
I had no choice!
The Warehouse was gone.

03:38.096 --> 03:41.065
[Boom]
You were gone.

03:41.099 --> 03:42.866
You too, HG.

03:42.901 --> 03:47.571
You saved Pete, you saved Myka
and me, but you were killed.

03:47.606 --> 03:51.542
That's why you pled
to the Regents on my behalf.

03:51.576 --> 03:53.911
- And the ytterbium chamber...
- Was destroyed.

03:53.945 --> 03:55.579
- Pandora's box?
- Gone.

03:55.614 --> 03:57.715
- What about hope?
- All gone!

03:57.749 --> 04:00.284
- Did I do wrong?
- No.

04:00.318 --> 04:03.287
I would've done the same.
But Arthur,

04:03.321 --> 04:05.889
- what are the repercussions?
- He said that I would be

04:05.924 --> 04:08.459
creating an evil
of my own making

04:08.493 --> 04:12.796
that I would have to live with
for the rest of my days.

04:26.678 --> 04:28.879
Mr. Bukowski,
when did all this start?

04:28.913 --> 04:31.115
Last night, I guess.
I started coughing

04:31.149 --> 04:33.984
- as I left the mill.
- The Siskel Steel Mill.

04:34.019 --> 04:36.954
Oh, that's right.
I read the file.

04:36.988 --> 04:38.756
[Snickers]

04:38.790 --> 04:41.058
So you work over there, or...

04:41.092 --> 04:43.327
Me and every other mook
south of 50 in Dalton, yes.

04:43.361 --> 04:44.795
Is that where you got sick?

04:44.829 --> 04:47.965
Docs have been runnin' tests.
Everything's negative.

04:47.999 --> 04:50.000
They won't even let me out
for the fights tonight.

04:50.035 --> 04:55.139
Right. Uh, Lenny...
have you received any old-timey

04:55.173 --> 04:58.242
- tools or...or equipment lately?
- No.

04:58.276 --> 05:00.577
- What about enemies?
- Enemies, no!

05:00.612 --> 05:03.213
People like me!
The only person I ever hated

05:03.248 --> 05:05.115
who hates me right back
is Hank Siskel.

05:05.150 --> 05:07.451
Oh, the owner of the mill.
Why?

05:07.485 --> 05:09.553
He's been withholding
paychecks for weeks. [Coughs]

05:09.587 --> 05:11.355
He just laid off 30 guys.

05:11.389 --> 05:13.791
Says he's bankrupt,
which is bull, so we push back!

05:13.825 --> 05:15.326
Start talking to the press,
picketing.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.761
We're just trying to save
our jobs... [Coughing]

05:17.796 --> 05:20.397
Sorry. He really
should rest now.

05:20.432 --> 05:23.067
Mr. Bukowski,
thank you for your time.

05:23.101 --> 05:26.070
Uh, would you call me
if there's any change?

Oh, look at that.

05:43.655 --> 05:45.556
I totally see you all
sporty teen out here,

05:45.590 --> 05:48.225
- shootin' hoops with dad!
- Mom, actually.

05:49.327 --> 05:50.627
This is a bad idea.

05:50.662 --> 05:51.962
No, Steve, come on!

05:51.996 --> 05:55.299
We're here.
Do you wanna tell me why

05:55.333 --> 05:57.034
you don't wanna go in there
so bad, before we actually

05:57.068 --> 05:58.736
- go in there?
- Look, my mom and I, we...

05:58.770 --> 06:00.104
- we had a fight.
- About the gay thing?

06:00.138 --> 06:01.839
What? No-no-no,
she doesn't care about that.

06:01.873 --> 06:03.340
This is New Jersey,
not North Carolina.

06:03.375 --> 06:06.043
- Okay, then, what?
- Can we just do this

06:06.077 --> 06:08.779
and go home?

06:08.813 --> 06:12.049
Yeah, okay, sure.
Let's meet evil mom.

06:17.655 --> 06:19.323
Steven.

06:20.825 --> 06:22.393
Hi, mom.

06:22.427 --> 06:25.095
[Chuckles]

06:25.130 --> 06:27.164
Oh, thank goodness you're here!

06:27.198 --> 06:31.702
Ma! Mom, ma, ma.
This is my friend Claudia.

06:31.736 --> 06:34.638
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you, Mrs. Jinks.

06:34.672 --> 06:36.774
Wonderful to meet you, too.
Welcome!

06:36.808 --> 06:40.711
I'm so happy to see you both!
Come on in! Come on in.

06:40.745 --> 06:44.014
Wow, what a nightmare
for you.

06:44.048 --> 06:46.183
- [Sighs]
- Hell, no, we won't go!

06:46.217 --> 06:48.085
We want jobs, we won't go!

06:48.119 --> 06:49.820
Hell, no, we won't go!

06:49.854 --> 06:51.388
We want jobs, we won't go!

06:51.423 --> 06:53.257
Hell, no, we won't go!

06:53.291 --> 06:55.459
We want jobs, we won't go!

06:55.493 --> 06:56.860
Hell, no, we won't go...

06:56.895 --> 06:59.730
Let's go, sheriff.
I gotta get in.

06:59.764 --> 07:03.133
[Chanting continues]

07:03.168 --> 07:05.536
Okay, so these places
are toxic.

07:05.570 --> 07:08.505
- Cancer, asbestos, black lung.
- Yeah, but nothing

07:08.540 --> 07:10.574
- that makes you rust.
- Get outta my way!

07:10.608 --> 07:13.944
Move it!
[Shouting]

07:13.978 --> 07:15.679
[Overlapping yelling]

07:15.713 --> 07:18.115
Hey...hey...hey...hey!
Break it up, break it up!

07:18.149 --> 07:20.784
Break it up, break it up!

07:20.819 --> 07:24.021
Somebody's working
today, jerk.

07:24.055 --> 07:25.589
Who the hell are you?

07:25.623 --> 07:28.091
Agents Lattimer and Bering,
Secret Service.

07:28.126 --> 07:30.527
Oh, great. The feds
are finally coming after Siskel.

07:30.562 --> 07:32.062
Nah...nah, we're not here
for him.

07:32.096 --> 07:34.364
We're trying to find out what
happened to Lenny Bukowski.

07:34.399 --> 07:36.900
[Coughs] Yeah? Well, you could
put that on Siskel, too.

07:36.935 --> 07:39.937
[Phone rings]
I'm Sam Garity, union rep here.

07:39.971 --> 07:43.040
- Excuse me.
- First, the gantry

07:43.074 --> 07:45.442
"accidentally" breaks,
and the foreman nearly gets

07:45.477 --> 07:47.511
- killed trying to fix it.
- Yeah, right after we filed

07:47.545 --> 07:49.780
- a complaint.
- Yeah. Then, Lenny gets sick.

07:49.814 --> 07:51.915
And now Siskel's threatening
to shut down the mill?

07:51.950 --> 07:53.484
- Mykes.
- Yeah?

07:53.518 --> 07:54.718
That was Lenny's doctor.

07:54.752 --> 07:56.220
He said his lung tissue's
so bad,

07:56.254 --> 07:57.588
they had to remove
a large part of it.

07:57.622 --> 08:03.427
[Hacking]

08:03.461 --> 08:05.429
Oh, my God!

08:05.463 --> 08:07.602
Pete! Call an ambulance!

08:14.672 --> 08:17.317
I don't know.
It's pretty gnarly, Artie.

08:17.352 --> 08:20.954
This guy's arm's
all cracking and orange,

08:20.989 --> 08:22.522
kinda like an old car
at the beach.

08:22.557 --> 08:25.258
You have any leads
on the artifact?

08:25.293 --> 08:26.893
No, no, not really.
This guy Siskel,

08:26.928 --> 08:28.495
the owner of the mill,

08:28.529 --> 08:30.631
his steel workers
are sure he's behind it all.

08:30.665 --> 08:33.634
- But, uh, they have no proof.
- Rather idiotic, isn't it?

08:33.668 --> 08:35.168
Causing an accident
at his own mill?

08:35.203 --> 08:36.937
And then calling attention
to yourself

08:36.971 --> 08:39.239
- by making your workers sick.
- Yeah, except according

08:39.273 --> 08:42.241
to the sheriff, he...he's broken
up two fights in three days.

08:42.275 --> 08:44.645
The first time,
uh, Siskel went up against

08:44.679 --> 08:47.114
Lenny Bukowski,
and today, it was Tim.

08:47.148 --> 08:48.749
Both of them wound up
in the hospital.

08:48.783 --> 08:50.384
I...I think
that's pretty suspicious.

08:50.418 --> 08:52.586
Yeah. You know,
that seems suspicious.

08:52.620 --> 08:55.689
- I just said that.
- Yes, I know.

08:55.723 --> 08:56.923
I was just confirming it.

08:56.958 --> 08:58.925
Look, I don't have
very much on Siskel,

08:58.960 --> 09:00.894
because I've been distracted.

09:00.928 --> 09:03.330
But I can tell you
that he changed his name

09:03.364 --> 09:05.499
from Hank Blaloc to Hank Siskel
in 2001.

09:05.533 --> 09:06.867
Oh, wow.

09:06.901 --> 09:09.269
- That's pretty sketch-ball.
- Indeed.

09:09.303 --> 09:11.905
Sketch-ball...sketch-ball!
What'd be the etymology

09:11.939 --> 09:13.874
- of a phrase...
- Arthur's very busy.

09:13.908 --> 09:15.375
- Oh! Hello.
- Mrs. Frederic?

09:15.410 --> 09:17.277
You're grown agents,
handle it!

09:17.311 --> 09:19.780
- You're stalling.
- No, I am not!

09:21.249 --> 09:23.116
I'm...we're...where was I?

09:23.151 --> 09:27.454
Creating an evil
of your own making.

09:27.488 --> 09:29.823
What exactly is this evil?

09:29.857 --> 09:30.924
I...I...

09:30.958 --> 09:32.893
Arthur, I know
you have theories.

09:32.927 --> 09:34.327
Actually, I don't.

09:34.362 --> 09:38.498
All I have is...
uh, I have a feeling.

09:38.533 --> 09:41.401
- I'm guessing a bad feeling.
- Yes, it makes me nauseous.

09:41.436 --> 09:44.237
But it's all I have.
A feeling that the evil is...

09:44.272 --> 09:47.741
- it may be Claudia.
- Claudia?

09:47.775 --> 09:51.111
- What makes you think this?
- It's a nightmare.

09:51.145 --> 09:54.347
Technically, it's a vision.
She's coming at me

09:54.382 --> 09:57.317
with a dagger,
and then she stabs me with it.

09:57.351 --> 09:59.052
The dagger you tasked me
to find?

09:59.087 --> 10:02.289
Yes, I wanted you to find it,
so that she wouldn't.

10:02.323 --> 10:04.882
You're mistaken, trust me.

10:04.968 --> 10:07.530
If you'd created an evil
in Claudia, I'd know it.

10:07.577 --> 10:08.507
All right.

10:08.546 --> 10:09.863
Then what is it?
What's the evil?

10:09.897 --> 10:12.365
Have you considered the man
who's been bringing artifacts

10:12.400 --> 10:13.900
back into the world?

10:13.935 --> 10:16.303
The one who's trying to kill
the people you care about.

10:16.906 --> 10:22.077
That this Brother Adrian
is the evil?

10:26.247 --> 10:28.548
Yeah. Oh, that is
definitely the smell.

10:28.583 --> 10:31.184
It's acai mate tea from Peru.

10:31.219 --> 10:34.321
Steven and I used to drink this
almost every day.

10:34.355 --> 10:36.590
Oh, he still does,
as a matter of fact.

10:36.624 --> 10:40.327
Otherwise, he gets
very, very cranky.

10:42.663 --> 10:46.066
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just that something

10:46.100 --> 10:49.369
you said was so...
so reminded me of my...

10:49.403 --> 10:53.440
Mom. Thanks for the tea.

10:53.474 --> 10:59.212
Well, um, I'm just glad
that you have such nice friends.

10:59.247 --> 11:01.982
So, I don't even know.
Are you, uh...are you still

11:02.016 --> 11:03.750
- at the ATF?
- Yep. Told ya,

11:03.785 --> 11:06.019
- nothing's changed.
- And you're still living

11:06.053 --> 11:08.989
- in New Jersey?
- Well, no, not really.

11:09.023 --> 11:11.424
All right.
So, ah...you know what?

11:11.459 --> 11:14.094
I can come visit you anywhere.
I love to travel...

11:14.128 --> 11:17.564
You can't.
It's complicated.

11:24.272 --> 11:26.273
All right.

11:28.142 --> 11:31.311
Steven, it has been two years.

11:31.345 --> 11:33.680
I am still your mother,
and I love you.

11:33.714 --> 11:35.482
When are we gonna talk about it?

11:35.516 --> 11:39.085
We're not, ma.
Right now, we just need to

11:39.120 --> 11:41.288
do something here,
in the house,

11:41.322 --> 11:43.623
and then we'll get
out of your hair.

11:45.459 --> 11:49.029
Well, this is your house, too.
And for the record,

11:49.063 --> 11:52.232
I don't want you
out of my hair.

11:57.004 --> 11:58.672
[Door thuds closed]

11:58.706 --> 12:00.540
But it makes sense.

12:00.575 --> 12:02.475
He wanted you to lie.

12:02.510 --> 12:04.878
He wants you isolated
and vulnerable.

12:04.912 --> 12:07.380
- Yet for what purpose?
- All I know is that he wants me

12:07.415 --> 12:08.515
to use the Astrolabe again.

12:08.549 --> 12:10.684
He wants me to undo that day
that I altered.

12:10.718 --> 12:12.686
But it's something that I...

12:12.720 --> 12:14.855
I can't do.
I can't...I won't do it.

12:14.889 --> 12:16.489
I assume the Astrolabe
is safe?

12:16.524 --> 12:17.991
Yes, of course it is.
It's safe.

12:18.025 --> 12:21.995
But if Brother Adrian
is the evil,

12:22.029 --> 12:24.197
then why am I having
these visions about Claudia?

12:24.232 --> 12:27.868
Arthur, Croatia,
Vienna, Stuttgart.

12:27.902 --> 12:29.836
You and I both know
how easy it is

12:29.871 --> 12:31.805
to implant
a subconscious thought.

12:31.839 --> 12:34.040
Yes, of course, you're right.

12:34.075 --> 12:37.344
Yeah, and I suppose that anyone
who's ever raised a teenager

12:37.378 --> 12:39.880
can imagine
being murdered by them.

12:39.914 --> 12:41.514
I'll take this up
with the Regents.

12:41.549 --> 12:43.683
We may be able to reach out
to the brotherhood

12:43.718 --> 12:45.085
through other channels.

12:48.956 --> 12:53.460
This is not how I wanted
to handle this, and you know it.

12:53.494 --> 12:54.761
- Artie...
- I trusted you...

12:54.795 --> 12:56.897
I'm sorry...
I'm trying to help you!

12:56.931 --> 12:59.332
Nobody understands the perils
of time travel artifacts

12:59.367 --> 13:01.735
like I do!
I've already lost two agents

13:01.769 --> 13:04.070
because of them.
I won't lose you, too.

13:05.139 --> 13:06.640
I hope you're right.

13:09.810 --> 13:12.612
But there's no turning back now.

13:16.517 --> 13:18.218
[Saw whining]

13:23.991 --> 13:29.562
Hello! I'm Agent Bering.
I'm here to talk to Hank Siskel?

13:29.597 --> 13:30.964
Thank you!

13:30.998 --> 13:32.499
Mr. Siskel,

13:32.533 --> 13:34.167
there's a lady cop
here to see you.

13:34.201 --> 13:35.702
Thank you.

13:42.977 --> 13:46.813
Pete, you are
in the clear.

13:46.847 --> 13:49.416
Hi, I'm Agent Bering.
I'm with the Secret Service.

13:49.450 --> 13:51.384
I'm here investigating
Lenny Bukowski's

13:51.419 --> 13:52.552
and Tim Watts' illnesses.

13:52.586 --> 13:54.688
Yeah, yeah, I saw you earlier.

13:56.257 --> 13:59.926
Now, Lenny and Tim.
It's an awful thing.

13:59.961 --> 14:01.428
I'm real close to my guys.

14:01.462 --> 14:04.764
Yeah, like India and Pakistan.

14:04.799 --> 14:06.566
Really?
Because I heard a rumor

14:06.600 --> 14:08.802
that you actually
made them sick.

14:08.836 --> 14:11.404
I made them sick?

14:11.439 --> 14:13.940
Jeez, talk about ungrateful.

14:13.975 --> 14:15.942
Look, in this economy,

14:15.977 --> 14:18.678
I'm drowning here
just keeping the lights on.

14:18.713 --> 14:22.449
Get down off the cross.
We need the wood!

14:22.483 --> 14:24.584
Your sign's, uh, incorrect.

14:24.618 --> 14:27.420
Didn't your foreman
have an accident here last week?

14:27.455 --> 14:28.989
His crew thinks
that you set it up

14:29.023 --> 14:30.256
because he lodged a complaint.

14:30.291 --> 14:31.791
But then again,
in this economy,

14:31.826 --> 14:33.927
maybe you needed
the extra insurance money.

14:33.961 --> 14:36.596
- Come again?
- Go, Mykes!

14:36.630 --> 14:38.431
You... are... the... 99%!

14:38.466 --> 14:40.700
Is that why
the Secret Service is here?

14:40.735 --> 14:42.335
But you're gonna need
a confession,

14:42.370 --> 14:43.970
'cause I'm finding zilch.

14:44.005 --> 14:46.606
Look, accidents happen
all the time,

14:46.640 --> 14:48.208
and it's always
"Blame the company."

14:48.242 --> 14:49.776
Let me tell you
something, lady.

14:49.810 --> 14:51.311
[Phone vibrates]
I'm fed up with this.

14:51.345 --> 14:52.846
I'm calling my attorneys.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.114
Where'd you get
that belt buckle?

14:54.148 --> 14:55.548
- What?
- Your belt buckle.

14:55.583 --> 14:57.517
- Where'd you get it?
- My buckle? What?

14:57.551 --> 14:59.819
Forget it, Mykes.
He's not the guy.

14:59.854 --> 15:01.921
Okay. You know what?
Never mind.

15:01.956 --> 15:05.525
Thank you so much.
I will be in touch.

15:05.559 --> 15:07.694
Pete, what the hell
is going on?

15:07.728 --> 15:09.329
We just got a call
from the hospital.

15:09.363 --> 15:11.731
There's a third rusting victim.
A woman.

15:11.766 --> 15:14.367
- What, another steel worker?
- No, that's the rub.

15:14.402 --> 15:18.371
This one's never been
to the mill.

15:18.406 --> 15:21.307
So...

15:21.342 --> 15:23.443
Here we are
from whence I came.

15:23.477 --> 15:25.845
- What next?
- Uh, I...not a clue.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.313
I would just like to say this
out loud again,

15:27.348 --> 15:30.617
that we have no idea
what the fallout might be.

15:30.651 --> 15:32.352
Look, I can't live
every minute of every day

15:32.386 --> 15:35.121
worrying about hurting you.
We need to do this.

15:35.156 --> 15:39.192
Yeah, I know, okay.
Um, so put your hand here.

15:39.226 --> 15:42.228
And then, I...I'm supposed
to focus on you,

15:42.263 --> 15:46.166
which is much easier
with you not dead.

15:46.200 --> 15:53.640
[Metronome ticking]

15:53.674 --> 15:56.643
So... is that it?

15:56.677 --> 15:58.278
Did...did it work?

15:58.312 --> 15:59.345
Uh...

15:59.380 --> 16:01.714
"To live free of this heart,

16:01.749 --> 16:03.850
one must find one's own;
And make a pure start,

16:03.884 --> 16:06.286
from whence one comes."
Did we not just do that?

16:08.222 --> 16:10.223
Only one way
to find out.

16:12.293 --> 16:14.727
Ste...
[Gasps]

16:14.762 --> 16:15.995
[Gasps]
[Glass breaking]

16:16.030 --> 16:19.365
[Gasping]
Steven! What was that?

16:19.400 --> 16:21.401
Oh, my God!
Steven, what's happening?

16:21.435 --> 16:23.970
Get up!
Get up, Steven!

16:24.004 --> 16:25.505
Steven!
Oh, what's happening to you?

16:25.539 --> 16:28.308
[Heavy breathing]
That did not work.

16:28.342 --> 16:29.876
- Steven, talk to me.
- We are never

16:29.910 --> 16:33.179
getting off this thing.
I came here for nothing!

16:33.214 --> 16:34.347
Steve!

16:37.051 --> 16:39.319
Please, tell me
what's happening.

16:39.353 --> 16:40.820
Talk to me.

16:43.804 --> 16:46.965
Ms. Miller,
when did all this start?

16:46.999 --> 16:48.099
Just this morning.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.343
I thought it was an allergy
at first.

16:50.568 --> 16:52.270
And you've never met
Hank Siskel

16:52.304 --> 16:53.971
or been to the steel mill?

16:54.006 --> 16:56.274
Uh, am I going
to be okay?

16:56.308 --> 16:59.810
Yes. Um, just excuse me
for a second.

16:59.845 --> 17:01.245
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.981
So doc says Lenny's going
downhill fast

17:04.016 --> 17:06.183
and says Tim's
not much better.

17:06.218 --> 17:09.587
There has to be a connection
between the three of them, Pete.

17:10.888 --> 17:13.523
Karen, hi.
Um, have you ever met

17:13.559 --> 17:16.327
Lenny Bukowski
or...or Tim Watts?

17:16.361 --> 17:18.829
Well, I...I don't think so.
Are...are they sick, too?

17:18.864 --> 17:22.199
Uh...is this some kind
of an outbreak?

17:22.233 --> 17:24.167
Tully's.
Uh, Ms. Miller,

17:24.202 --> 17:27.104
- do you work out at Tully's gym?
- Yeah, I do a little boxing.

17:27.138 --> 17:29.774
Do any of the guys from
the steel mill box there, too?

17:29.808 --> 17:32.310
Well, sure,
a bunch of 'em.

17:34.413 --> 17:37.848
[Thudding sounds, grunting]

17:37.883 --> 17:40.551
[Indistinct chatter]

17:40.586 --> 17:42.687
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:42.721 --> 17:45.323
It's, like, 200 degrees
in here,

17:45.357 --> 17:48.159
- and it smells like your room.
- Ah, light a match.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.528
The owner
says that Hank Siskel

17:50.562 --> 17:54.198
wouldn't be caught dead in here.
And now, I can see why.

17:54.232 --> 17:56.400
What are you two doing here?

17:56.435 --> 17:57.969
Well, it turns out Siskel

17:58.003 --> 18:00.638
may not be the one making
your friends sick after all.

18:00.672 --> 18:02.373
- What makes you say that?
- Another victim.

18:02.407 --> 18:03.808
This one's never been
to the mill

18:03.842 --> 18:05.543
- but boxes here with you guys.
- W...wait a minute.

18:05.577 --> 18:06.844
So you're trying to say
there could be something

18:06.878 --> 18:08.946
- here at Tully's?
- Hey, there's nothing wrong

18:08.981 --> 18:10.615
with my gym.
I use bleach.

18:10.649 --> 18:13.050
That's just Siskel
trying to hit us where it hurts.

18:13.085 --> 18:14.385
The fights here give people
in this town

18:14.419 --> 18:15.553
something to cheer for.

18:15.587 --> 18:17.288
Of course
he'd wanna shut them down.

18:17.322 --> 18:19.290
You think
he's that diabolical?

18:19.324 --> 18:20.358
Everyone does!

18:20.392 --> 18:22.226
Standing up to him
keeps us strong.

18:22.260 --> 18:23.828
You wanna take that
away from us?

18:23.862 --> 18:26.263
- Whose side are you on, anyway?
- I'm not on anybody's side.

18:26.298 --> 18:27.798
You should be on the side
of the workers.

18:27.833 --> 18:29.500
All right, all right.
Wanna fight?

18:29.534 --> 18:32.169
Take it in the ring...
otherwise, let's break this up.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.708
- So are you thinking...
- Sam Garity's our guy?

18:37.743 --> 18:40.344
He's certainly more interested
in the cause than the truth.

18:40.379 --> 18:42.947
Enough to maybe use
an artifact to...to make

18:42.981 --> 18:44.882
- Hank Siskel look bad?
- Mykes, we gotta talk

18:44.916 --> 18:47.918
to these guys one-on-one before
Tim and Lenny run out of time.

18:47.953 --> 18:50.488
How are we gonna do that?

18:50.522 --> 18:53.457
A little
hands-on interrogation.

18:53.492 --> 18:56.327
[Upbeat pop tune]

18:56.361 --> 18:58.929
Hey, fool! What's
my prediction for the fight?

18:58.964 --> 18:59.997
Pain!

19:00.032 --> 19:04.068
Ooh!
Oh, oh, oh! Okay, all right.

19:04.102 --> 19:08.673
So, uh, you ever see anyone
around here using anything

19:08.707 --> 19:11.442
I don't know... unusual?
[Grunts]

19:13.645 --> 19:16.047
You know, like,
uh, I don't know,

19:16.081 --> 19:18.082
- Sam Garity?
- What about him?

19:18.116 --> 19:20.785
He's...he's pretty intense,
isn't he?

19:20.819 --> 19:22.720
- What do you mean?
- You know, his whole

19:22.754 --> 19:25.890
- "Stick it to the man" thing.
- He looks out for us.

19:25.924 --> 19:28.826
All right.
You, or his union?

19:28.860 --> 19:31.996
You're barkin' up
the wrong tree, bro.

19:32.030 --> 19:34.932
Here, now, I got nothing.
Closest match I found

19:34.966 --> 19:37.835
was Nero's lyre
from the great fire of Rome.

19:37.869 --> 19:39.303
If you play <i>Sack Of Ilium,</i>

19:39.337 --> 19:42.173
it's said to burn
and peel your face off.

19:42.207 --> 19:44.375
Eww! Well, that's not exactly

19:44.409 --> 19:45.910
what this does.
Besides, I don't think

19:45.944 --> 19:47.978
that anyone in this gym
could play <i>The Sack Of Ilium</i>

19:48.013 --> 19:50.614
- on a lyre.
- So your union rep...

19:50.649 --> 19:53.684
Does he, uh, does he collect
anything antique-y?

19:53.719 --> 19:54.952
Who knows.
Probably.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.987
What do you care?
No, I'm just saying

19:57.022 --> 20:00.024
maybe he took out a couple guys
to make Siskel look bad.

20:00.058 --> 20:01.325
Ooh! Oh! Oh!

20:01.359 --> 20:03.160
[Gasps]

20:03.195 --> 20:05.930
In 1996, Siskel...

20:05.964 --> 20:07.732
he was
then Hank Blaloc...

20:07.766 --> 20:09.667
he owned a restaurant
in Oakland.

20:09.701 --> 20:13.771
He was arrested for labor abuse
of illegal busboys.

20:13.805 --> 20:15.740
So the man is trash.

20:15.774 --> 20:18.175
Sadly, he's just not
our main suspect anymore.

20:18.210 --> 20:19.443
Well, then, who is?

20:19.478 --> 20:21.545
Fight!

20:21.580 --> 20:23.214
Nice!

20:25.383 --> 20:27.985
Myka, do you even have
a suspect?

20:28.019 --> 20:30.354
Possibly.

20:32.057 --> 20:34.658
You got something
to say to me?

20:35.994 --> 20:41.398
Uh, no, no.
Just, uh, getting some exercise.

20:41.433 --> 20:42.500
Then why all the questions?

20:42.534 --> 20:45.803
Well, some guys
are getting sick.

20:45.837 --> 20:49.006
Town hates Siskel,
and that works out for you.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.742
Oh.

20:51.777 --> 20:53.043
Okay, that's not good.

20:53.078 --> 20:54.678
Well, what's wrong?
Myka, where's Pete?

20:54.713 --> 20:57.581
Uh, he's doing some hands-on
i-i-interrogating.

20:57.616 --> 20:59.917
I'll call you back.

20:59.951 --> 21:02.453
Come on, Sam!
It's cool!

21:03.010 --> 21:06.141
- Just chill out!
- Yeah, I got it, Sam.

21:08.894 --> 21:11.729
- Oh, boy.
- Let's go, Cody!

21:11.763 --> 21:15.366
- What do you got against Sammy?
- Sammy? We're friends.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.635
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:17.669 --> 21:19.637
- Hey, you're a marine, huh?
- That's right.

21:19.671 --> 21:22.439
- Me too. What'd you serve?
- 4th Battalion,

21:22.474 --> 21:24.708
3rd Marines.
Fallujah and Al Asad airbase.

21:24.743 --> 21:27.611
Two different tours.
And yourself?

21:27.646 --> 21:29.313
5th Battalion,
7th Marines.

21:29.347 --> 21:31.849
Afghanistan, the quiet years.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.817
Well, you know, quieter.

21:33.852 --> 21:37.354
Okay. So why are you
after my friend?

21:37.389 --> 21:41.859
I'm not!
But people are being poisoned.

21:41.893 --> 21:43.994
And he's got a motive.

21:44.029 --> 21:48.499
[Yelling]

21:48.533 --> 21:52.236
- Hey!
- Hey, it was a clean hit!

21:52.270 --> 21:54.538
Pete, are you okay? Pete?

21:54.572 --> 21:56.573
Maybe I shouldn't have asked.

21:56.608 --> 21:59.543
I know this sounds...
well, completely insane.

21:59.577 --> 22:02.346
But Steve is connected to this.

22:02.380 --> 22:06.917
And we had hoped by coming here
we could u-unconnect him.

22:06.951 --> 22:10.754
I-I'm not even gonna
pretend to understand

22:10.789 --> 22:11.822
what you're talking about.

22:11.856 --> 22:14.358
I just thought that Steve
was finally here

22:14.392 --> 22:17.828
to talk about everything
after all this time.

22:17.862 --> 22:21.365
Can I ask...
just what happened?

22:23.435 --> 22:28.572
Sometimes, you get a look,
and you're just like her.

22:28.606 --> 22:34.111
- My girl.
- Yeah, Steve's mentioned that.

22:37.849 --> 22:43.153
So, um, it started
at the sentencing

22:43.188 --> 22:45.289
for the boy who killed Olivia.

22:45.323 --> 22:47.791
A robbery gone bad,
wasn't it?

22:47.826 --> 22:51.595
Mm-hmm. And the state wanted
to make an example of him,

22:51.629 --> 22:54.164
so he was facing
the death penalty.

22:54.199 --> 22:57.134
And the trial, it...
all the months before,

22:57.168 --> 23:01.238
the waiting... oh.
There's so much anger and pain,

23:01.272 --> 23:04.741
and... I needed it
to be over.

23:04.776 --> 23:08.145
Did they...I mean, did he get
the death penalty?

23:08.179 --> 23:09.980
I didn't see the point

23:10.014 --> 23:14.818
of adding this boy's family's
suffering to our own.

23:14.853 --> 23:17.121
It was enough that he was going
to spend the rest of his life

23:17.155 --> 23:19.923
in jail, so I...
I fought against it.

23:19.958 --> 23:25.629
That must've been
so hard.

23:25.663 --> 23:28.999
Yes, until I saw
his mother's face.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.968
It was the right thing to do.

23:31.002 --> 23:34.371
But Stevie felt like
I had betrayed Olivia.

23:34.405 --> 23:35.939
I thought that we would

23:35.974 --> 23:38.275
eventually make our peace,
and get past it, but he...

23:38.309 --> 23:41.879
- But he just left.
- Yeah.

23:49.621 --> 23:56.760
Hmm. This poem, it reminds me
of the day my babies were born.

23:56.794 --> 23:59.530
"From whence one comes."

23:59.564 --> 24:01.331
From whence one comes?

24:01.366 --> 24:04.134
You know, I don't think
there's a moment

24:04.169 --> 24:07.838
in a mother's life
that's more pure than that.

24:07.872 --> 24:09.907
"Make a pure start."

24:13.878 --> 24:16.446
Pete? Pete, it's time
for the big fight.

24:16.481 --> 24:20.250
Okay. Thank you.
I'm g...I'm fine.

24:20.285 --> 24:21.518
I'm fine, I'm fine.

24:21.553 --> 24:25.556
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.558
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

24:27.592 --> 24:31.395
Welcome to Tully's.
We got a great fight tonight.

24:31.429 --> 24:35.098
In the blue corner,
weighing in at 175 pounds,

24:35.133 --> 24:37.868
the best of buhl...
Todd Murray!

24:37.902 --> 24:40.437
Are you sure you're okay?
You still look a little woozy.

24:40.471 --> 24:43.173
That's my look.

24:43.208 --> 24:44.408
[Booing, cheering]

24:44.442 --> 24:45.909
Weighing in at 180...

24:45.944 --> 24:47.945
There are a lot more people
here, though, right?

24:47.979 --> 24:49.846
- Yes.
- Okay.

24:49.881 --> 24:51.748
Dalton's new hope...

24:51.783 --> 24:53.350
Cody Bell!

24:53.384 --> 24:55.953
[Cheering and whistling]

24:57.956 --> 25:00.390
Oh, ow! Loud! Loud!

25:00.425 --> 25:01.658
Pete, listen.

25:01.693 --> 25:05.028
When Cody hit you,
I think that I-I saw something.

25:05.063 --> 25:07.631
All I saw were stars.
Oh, and birds.

25:07.665 --> 25:10.234
No! Listen to me!
It...it was almost like a shadow

25:10.268 --> 25:14.371
on his arm, and then a loud
noise like, uh...like a yell.

25:14.405 --> 25:16.540
So, what, you think
he whammied me?

25:16.574 --> 25:19.009
It went by so fast,
I-I, honestly, I just...

25:19.043 --> 25:21.812
- I don't know!
- Well, my money's on Garity.

25:21.846 --> 25:24.381
Every time I ask,
his boys unleashed.

25:24.415 --> 25:28.385
[Bell rings]
Well, let's go find out.

25:28.419 --> 25:30.654
- Okay.
- Okay. You sure you're okay?

25:30.688 --> 25:32.356
Yeah.

25:35.393 --> 25:39.129
Pound him, Code!
Watch the hook!

25:39.163 --> 25:41.765
Garity! Hey, we know
it's you.

25:41.799 --> 25:44.534
You know it's me what?
That's the stuff!

25:44.569 --> 25:46.703
He's only been fightin'
a couple of months.

25:46.738 --> 25:49.039
- The kid's a natural.
- Hey, quit stallin', okay?

25:49.073 --> 25:51.108
Whatever you guys are using,
it's killing people.

25:51.142 --> 25:54.044
I told you, Siskel's your man.

25:54.078 --> 25:56.546
Go Code!
Do it for Charlie!

25:56.581 --> 25:57.781
Who's Charlie?

25:57.815 --> 25:59.883
His dad.

25:59.917 --> 26:02.386
Foreman who had
the accident?

26:02.420 --> 26:04.855
Wait...Sam,
is Cody using something

26:04.889 --> 26:06.490
to...to make himself stronger?

26:06.524 --> 26:08.125
What the hell
are you saying now?

26:08.159 --> 26:10.394
Does Cody know Karen Miller?

26:10.428 --> 26:12.462
Yeah, yeah, they went out
a couple times.

26:12.497 --> 26:15.265
[Coughing]

26:15.300 --> 26:16.867
Oh, my God.

26:16.901 --> 26:19.236
Pete! Pete, just...
just take him.

26:19.270 --> 26:20.237
I'll stay here.

26:20.271 --> 26:22.539
[Crowd cheering]

26:28.513 --> 26:29.513
[Louder cheering]

26:33.651 --> 26:35.385
He's out!
[Bell dings]

26:35.420 --> 26:37.988
[Cheering]

26:41.259 --> 26:46.496
Cody Lane,
Dalton's own champeen!

26:46.531 --> 26:48.332
Hey, Marlene!
Now we can finally

26:48.366 --> 26:51.468
get that roof
of yours fixed!

26:51.502 --> 26:52.469
Woo!

26:52.503 --> 26:55.005
- Hey.
- Pete, I was right.

26:55.039 --> 26:57.207
I did see something.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.343
[Beep]

26:59.377 --> 27:02.813
Question is: What is it?

27:11.799 --> 27:13.990
You still pissed?

27:16.093 --> 27:17.627
I'm sorry. It's...
this all just...

27:17.661 --> 27:19.395
it makes me crazy.

27:19.429 --> 27:22.558
Well... Schumann
did go insane.

27:22.610 --> 27:24.847
Okay, that's not helping.

27:30.909 --> 27:32.476
You know,
in a parallel universe,

27:32.510 --> 27:36.046
I could totally see this
being my room.

27:37.382 --> 27:39.483
Steve, what if
"From whence one comes"

27:39.517 --> 27:41.718
isn't your home...
it's your mom?

27:41.753 --> 27:43.620
And...and "Make a pure start,"

27:43.655 --> 27:45.455
that's the day you were born,
a moment of pure love

27:45.490 --> 27:47.090
between you two.
What...what if Schumann

27:47.125 --> 27:49.593
was tight with his mom?

27:49.627 --> 27:51.228
I guess it's all over then.

27:52.864 --> 27:54.731
Why are you so angry?

27:54.766 --> 27:57.668
I talked to her about it,
and I get where she...

27:57.702 --> 28:00.304
He killed my sister!

28:00.338 --> 28:03.307
Yes, and isn't forgiveness

28:03.341 --> 28:05.042
a big part
of the buddhism thing?

28:05.076 --> 28:09.713
Well, I am a work
in progress, okay?

28:09.747 --> 28:12.582
I just...I don't get
how you can miss your daughter

28:12.617 --> 28:14.851
so much that you keep her room
intact for years,

28:14.886 --> 28:18.355
but then you go out, and you
fight for her murderer's life.

28:18.389 --> 28:22.826
I tried to tell you,
but you didn't wanna hear it.

28:22.860 --> 28:24.628
So tell me now.

28:24.662 --> 28:27.097
Steven,
they're separate things.

28:27.131 --> 28:29.399
Loving my daughter
and my conscience,

28:29.434 --> 28:31.735
they're...
they're separate things!

28:31.769 --> 28:33.870
This is not good
for your soul!

28:33.905 --> 28:36.239
All this hate and anger
is not good for you!

28:36.274 --> 28:39.409
No, mom! I am sorry.
That scumbag is alive,

28:39.444 --> 28:43.647
and Livvy is dead.
I mean, how can you...

28:43.681 --> 28:45.982
it's like you...
you just flip a switch.

28:46.017 --> 28:48.819
Except that I didn't.
How can you say that?

28:48.853 --> 28:50.787
I live with her death
as much as you do.

28:50.822 --> 28:53.490
And I-I didn't...
I didn't forgive that boy...

28:53.524 --> 28:54.925
Well, it sure
looked like it.

28:54.959 --> 28:58.295
No, I have to forgive him
every day, again and again,

28:58.329 --> 29:00.931
over and over.
Every single day of my life,

29:00.965 --> 29:02.532
I have to let go
of my anger.

29:02.567 --> 29:04.634
How do you do that?

29:04.669 --> 29:06.203
Mom, because
I sure as hell can't.

29:06.237 --> 29:09.940
I think about her.

29:09.974 --> 29:12.876
You think about him every day,

29:12.910 --> 29:14.978
but I-I think about her,

29:15.012 --> 29:17.314
because it's what she would do,

29:17.348 --> 29:21.585
and I think
that you know that.

29:33.464 --> 29:35.065
[Cries]

29:35.099 --> 29:42.172
I wanna let it go.
I really...I really do.

29:42.206 --> 29:44.674
But I don't know how.

29:44.709 --> 29:48.311
I don't know.

29:48.346 --> 29:52.783
Maybe do what
your mom does, maybe.

29:52.817 --> 29:55.118
[Sighs] Think of Olivia.

30:06.731 --> 30:09.266
No, never been
to Tully's,

30:09.300 --> 30:11.401
but my boy sure
is making me proud.

30:11.436 --> 30:14.104
[Laughs] Yeah, he seems
like a great guy.

30:14.138 --> 30:17.307
- I-I get a good vibe from him.
- Mr. Bell, where do you think

30:17.341 --> 30:20.677
that Cody's sudden newfound
boxing strength comes from?

30:20.711 --> 30:21.878
Anger, maybe.

30:21.913 --> 30:24.181
Our accident got him
pretty upset.

30:24.215 --> 30:26.750
Somebody messed with that gantry
to make it fail.

30:26.784 --> 30:29.319
Okay, you just said
"our" accident.

30:29.353 --> 30:30.821
You mean Cody was there?

30:30.855 --> 30:33.056
Was he there?
He saved my life.

30:34.091 --> 30:37.527
[Machinery droning]

30:42.266 --> 30:44.568
Damn it! I'm getting
too old for this.

30:47.338 --> 30:48.705
Dad!

30:48.739 --> 30:50.240
No!
No...ahh!

30:50.274 --> 30:55.145
Ahh! Ahh!
Ahh!

30:55.179 --> 30:58.748
- Ahhhhhhh!
- Ahh!

30:58.783 --> 31:00.517
- Ahh!
- Eyahh!

31:00.551 --> 31:01.651
Ahhhhh!

31:01.686 --> 31:03.920
[Machine armor unleashing]

31:03.955 --> 31:07.824
Dad, you all right?

31:07.859 --> 31:11.728
It was unbelievable.
I'm 220 pounds...

31:11.762 --> 31:14.130
And he lifted me up
with one arm.

31:14.165 --> 31:16.533
Mr. Bell, we think that Cody
may be using something

31:16.567 --> 31:18.635
artificial to enhance
his strength.

31:18.669 --> 31:21.171
- You mean like 'roids?
- Like 'roids on 'roids.

31:21.205 --> 31:24.374
No! No way.
It ain't bad enough

31:24.408 --> 31:27.277
he did two tours in hell,
comes home to a dead-end job

31:27.311 --> 31:31.615
in a busted-up town.
Now you think he's juicin'?

31:31.649 --> 31:36.453
There. Read that.
My boy is a hero.

31:36.487 --> 31:39.222
Purple heart.
Rescued two other soldiers

31:39.257 --> 31:43.059
- in an IED explosion.
- "National museum."

31:43.094 --> 31:47.397
Pete, uh... Mr. Bell!
Would you, um, just excuse us

31:47.431 --> 31:51.301
for a second?
Thank you.

31:52.570 --> 31:55.705
Yes! December 2005.
It was an explosion

31:55.740 --> 31:59.409
at the Baghdad National Museum.
South wing, they were housing

31:59.443 --> 32:03.079
a collection of 7th century
Peloponnesian items.

32:03.114 --> 32:06.616
- Peloponnesian? Uh, the Greeks?
- The 300 Spartans

32:06.651 --> 32:10.120
and their stand
against the Persians.

32:10.154 --> 32:13.456
Ah, dude, I love that movie!
I work out to it all the time.

32:13.491 --> 32:17.360
Here! All right.
Spartan armor said to have been

32:17.395 --> 32:20.597
imbued with their strength
and defiance.

32:20.631 --> 32:22.933
It sounds like Cody,
f-fighting for his dad,

32:22.967 --> 32:24.634
- for his town.
- Okay, but where do we find

32:24.669 --> 32:26.202
the artifact?
I mean, what are we looking for,

32:26.237 --> 32:27.571
- a suit of armor?
- Well, it could be

32:27.605 --> 32:29.606
in a piece of helmet,
it could be in a breast plate.

32:29.640 --> 32:32.008
I know that archaeologists
have found traces of iron

32:32.043 --> 32:34.077
in Spartan armor,
which would explain the rusting.

32:34.111 --> 32:35.345
All right, we need
to search his house.

32:35.379 --> 32:37.047
Wait, wait,
the newspaper article.

32:37.081 --> 32:40.150
The...the article said that...
said that Cody was...

32:40.184 --> 32:43.787
was struck by shrapnel
during the explosion.

32:45.656 --> 32:48.024
So what if he doesn't know
that he has it?

32:48.059 --> 32:51.227
- Holy crap, are you thinking...
- Th-the scars on Cody's chest,

32:51.262 --> 32:53.129
if they were caused
during the explosion...

32:53.164 --> 32:54.598
The artifact could be
inside him.

32:54.632 --> 32:56.566
As shrapnel.
That...that's a new one.

32:56.601 --> 32:58.602
[Snaps] The scars...
the scars are on the left side,

32:58.636 --> 33:01.671
uh, of Cody's chest, which is
connected to his left arm,

33:01.706 --> 33:03.573
the same arm that Tim held
at the picket line,

33:03.608 --> 33:05.141
the arm that Sam Garity
pushed at the gym,

33:05.176 --> 33:07.177
probably even the same arm

33:07.211 --> 33:08.778
that Cody used
to save his father!

33:08.813 --> 33:11.448
Yeah, no, no, Mykes, 'cause
he punched me with that arm.

33:11.482 --> 33:13.817
How come I'm not sick,
or...or the other boxers?

33:13.851 --> 33:17.821
Well, boxing gloves... maybe...
maybe it has to be skin-on-skin.

33:17.855 --> 33:20.724
And only in an
emotionally-heightened moment

33:20.758 --> 33:24.494
- would its power be focused.
- No, no, his dad's not rusting.

33:24.528 --> 33:27.631
Okay? Cody grabbed his arm.
He saved his dad's life.

33:27.665 --> 33:29.232
That's pretty
emotionally-heightened.

33:29.266 --> 33:33.837
Exactly. It's possible
that that incident

33:33.871 --> 33:36.773
is what activated
the shrapnel inside him.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.775
Right, because Cody started
making people sick

33:38.809 --> 33:42.379
- after the mill accident.
- You know what? This sucks.

33:42.413 --> 33:44.314
Okay? I don't wanna take away
this kid's strength.

33:44.348 --> 33:46.049
This town needs something
to root for.

33:46.083 --> 33:48.351
Pete, Cody already put
four people in the hospital

33:48.386 --> 33:51.221
who are going to die
i-i-if we don't get this thing

33:51.255 --> 33:52.656
out of him.
The only question is:

33:52.690 --> 33:54.958
- How do we do it?
- Hey, Cody!

33:54.992 --> 33:56.893
Your dad's doing much better.
You been in to see him?

33:56.927 --> 34:00.130
Uh, no, uh...wait a minute.
This started at the mill?

34:00.164 --> 34:01.498
- It's me?
- Look, Cody...

34:01.532 --> 34:02.832
I'm the one
making people sick?

34:02.867 --> 34:03.967
When were you gonna
tell me, man...

34:04.001 --> 34:05.568
- Just come with us.
- No, get off me!

34:05.603 --> 34:07.070
- Get away from me!
- Hey, Cody!

34:07.104 --> 34:09.873
- Hey, we just wanna help!
- Whoa-whoa-whoa!

34:09.907 --> 34:11.675
Cody!

34:13.043 --> 34:14.177
Aah!

34:21.619 --> 34:24.254
I bet I know
where he's gone.

34:39.098 --> 34:42.690
Mom, I am so sorry.

34:44.003 --> 34:47.105
All that I had left of her
was my anger.

34:47.139 --> 34:48.873
Maybe I got scared
that letting that go

34:48.908 --> 34:51.610
- meant letting her go.
- You couldn't let go of her

34:51.643 --> 34:55.647
if you tried.
[Sniffles]

34:55.681 --> 34:58.483
[Indistinct muttering]

35:02.655 --> 35:05.156
- [Gasps] Mrs. Jinks?
- Mom! Mom, what's wrong?

35:05.191 --> 35:08.460
- Oh, my God!
- It's the metronome!

35:08.494 --> 35:11.262
- Emma! Emma, breathe!
- It won't stop! Mom!

35:11.297 --> 35:13.298
- Claudia, please do something!
- I don't know what to do!

35:13.332 --> 35:15.333
- Breathe, Emma!
- Damn thing!

35:15.368 --> 35:17.135
Jinksy, no!

35:17.169 --> 35:19.270
[Boom]

35:19.305 --> 35:21.573
- [Gasps]
- Mom! Hey...hey, it's okay!

35:21.607 --> 35:22.841
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

35:22.875 --> 35:25.010
You're all right.
It's over.

35:25.044 --> 35:27.812
[Gasping]

35:30.349 --> 35:33.652
- Claudia? Claudia, am I...
- Yeah.

35:33.686 --> 35:34.686
You're alive.

35:38.391 --> 35:41.359
Can you feel
my heart beating?

35:41.394 --> 35:44.796
What...what just happened?

35:44.830 --> 35:46.831
A...a pure start.

35:46.866 --> 35:49.634
You didn't care if you died.
All you cared about was her,

35:49.669 --> 35:54.172
so you sacrificed
your own heart to save her.

35:54.206 --> 35:58.977
An act of pure love.
Welcome back, Jinksy.

35:59.011 --> 36:00.779
Welcome home.

36:04.016 --> 36:06.484
[Emma murmuring, crying]

36:06.519 --> 36:10.488
[Coughing]

36:13.325 --> 36:15.694
You almost killed my dad!

36:15.728 --> 36:18.863
- Your father had an accident.
- That you set up

36:18.898 --> 36:21.099
for insurance money, Siskel,
and everyone knows it!

36:21.133 --> 36:23.535
- Kid, you're outta your mind!
- Am I?

36:23.569 --> 36:25.837
'Cause somehow now,
because of that accident,

36:25.871 --> 36:29.641
I am poisoning people!
Everyone...my friends, everyone!

36:37.283 --> 36:39.784
- Cody, no!
- Ee-yahhh!

36:46.892 --> 36:48.359
Man, are you nuts?

36:48.394 --> 36:50.595
You guys told me
this thing is killing people!

36:50.629 --> 36:52.630
You are a hero, Cody, okay?

36:52.665 --> 36:55.467
Don't waste it on a guy
like Siskel.

36:55.501 --> 36:56.801
- No, get out of my way...
- No!

36:56.836 --> 36:58.737
- Get out of my way!
- No...

37:02.942 --> 37:07.278
- Where's Cody?
- You keep him away from me.

37:07.313 --> 37:10.982
- Where is he?
- He's by the milling machines.

37:11.016 --> 37:12.751
- [Coughing]
- You see?

37:12.785 --> 37:14.419
It's starting
to happen to you now.

37:14.453 --> 37:18.123
[Coughs] That's right,
and it's gonna keep happening,

37:18.157 --> 37:20.091
'cause I'm not gonna
let you do this!

37:20.126 --> 37:22.360
Ahh!

37:22.394 --> 37:25.630
He saved me from that psycho
Cody Bell.

37:25.664 --> 37:27.599
Now let me go, will ya?

37:27.633 --> 37:29.467
No, I'm not quite done
with you yet.

37:29.502 --> 37:31.035
Siskel took everything
from me!

37:31.070 --> 37:34.806
No! No, he hasn't!
You know who you are, Cody.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.908
This town needs you!
It needs you...

37:36.942 --> 37:40.345
Move! Siskel has to pay!

37:40.379 --> 37:42.447
I know who you are.

37:42.481 --> 37:45.984
You're Hank Blaloc.
You cut corners and played games

37:46.018 --> 37:47.652
in Oakland,
just like you did here.

37:47.686 --> 37:50.488
- You can't prove that.
- Really?

37:50.523 --> 37:53.024
Should I call the FBI,
or OSHA,

37:53.058 --> 37:55.026
or maybe just
your insurance adjuster

37:55.060 --> 37:56.728
with a theory?

37:56.762 --> 37:59.230
Or I could just hand you over
to Cody.

37:59.265 --> 38:00.465
All right, all right,

38:00.499 --> 38:03.368
all right, yes, yes.
The gantry was rigged

38:03.402 --> 38:04.702
for the insurance money.

38:04.737 --> 38:06.504
But they weren't supposed
to try fixing it.

38:06.539 --> 38:08.706
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

38:08.741 --> 38:10.341
What do you want
from me?

38:10.376 --> 38:12.210
You're going
to make this right.

38:12.244 --> 38:14.746
Why is this happening
to me, man? Huh?

38:14.780 --> 38:17.749
All we wanted is
a fair shake, that's it!

38:17.783 --> 38:19.617
No, just stay down!
Stay down!

38:19.652 --> 38:22.754
No...no! No, you're gonna
have to kill me.

38:22.788 --> 38:26.024
Come on!
Could you do it, Cody?

38:26.058 --> 38:29.327
Are you a killer?
Are you a killer?

38:32.865 --> 38:36.534
- No, I'm not.
- Good.

38:38.470 --> 38:40.872
[Hacking]

38:40.906 --> 38:42.740
- What did you do to him?
- Look, I'm sorry.

38:42.775 --> 38:44.676
He kept coming at me.
Look, I didn't mean

38:44.710 --> 38:46.411
to hurt anyone.
I'm...I'll go get an ambulance.

38:46.445 --> 38:49.047
No...no, wait!
It's not gonna help, okay?

38:49.081 --> 38:51.783
In order to stop this,
in order to save everyone,

38:51.817 --> 38:55.153
we need to neutralize the
shrapnel that's in your chest.

38:55.187 --> 38:56.421
Neutralize...okay.

38:56.455 --> 38:58.656
It's...whatever...
how do we do that?

38:58.691 --> 39:00.925
- We remove it.
- You can't, it's up against

39:00.960 --> 39:03.561
my heart here.
You'll kill me.

39:03.596 --> 39:04.696
- [Gasps]
- [Hacking]

39:04.730 --> 39:08.166
Okay, so...so...so...
so we improvise.

39:08.200 --> 39:11.302
- How? What?
- I just...don't know!

39:11.337 --> 39:12.770
The first aid kit.

39:12.805 --> 39:15.006
Bring me the first aid kit.
Pete, I'm gonna

39:15.040 --> 39:16.674
figure this out, okay?
You're gonna be okay.

39:16.709 --> 39:20.178
- Okay.
- We can't bring the artifact

39:20.212 --> 39:22.714
to the goo, I will bring the goo
to the artifact.

39:22.748 --> 39:24.749
- Mykes, what are you doing?
- I'm bringing the goo

39:24.783 --> 39:26.484
- to the artifact.
- Can you do that?

39:26.518 --> 39:31.489
- Do you have a better idea?
- [Hacking]

39:31.523 --> 39:33.324
- No.
- Look...look-look, just do it,

39:33.359 --> 39:35.793
okay? Forget about me.
Save them.

39:35.828 --> 39:38.263
Do it!
'Cause if you won't, I will.

39:40.432 --> 39:42.734
- Oh, my God.
- Do it.

39:44.637 --> 39:48.106
Okay!
Okay!

39:48.140 --> 39:50.308
Ahh!

40:01.053 --> 40:06.424
[Sighs] Okay.
Okay.

40:06.458 --> 40:07.959
[Sighs]

40:08.857 --> 40:10.489
Now, that's a purple heart.

40:10.537 --> 40:12.505
[Laughs]

40:20.646 --> 40:23.324
[Police radio chatter]

40:23.358 --> 40:25.311
How do I thank you guys?

40:25.360 --> 40:27.889
I mean, I still don't know
what happened.

40:28.030 --> 40:30.064
But not only did you save me
and my friends,

40:30.099 --> 40:31.766
it's like
you guys saved our jobs, too.

40:31.801 --> 40:33.234
Siskel called Sam Garity,

40:33.269 --> 40:35.937
offered to hire us all back
in exchange for a truce.

40:35.971 --> 40:38.373
Well, I guess you guys
had him on the ropes.

40:38.407 --> 40:40.909
Yeah. Maybe next time,
I get you guys back.

40:40.943 --> 40:42.944
Aw, yeah. Yep.

40:42.978 --> 40:45.228
[Chuckles] I'll just be
over here.

40:45.715 --> 40:48.650
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

40:48.684 --> 40:52.854
Sorry I had to kick your ass.
[Laughs]

40:52.888 --> 40:54.022
I was asking for it,
right?

40:55.558 --> 40:59.995
- Semper fi, Marine.
- Semper fi, Devil Dog.

41:00.029 --> 41:01.429
Take care of yourself.

41:01.464 --> 41:04.499
I'll take it
any way I can get it.

41:09.031 --> 41:11.066
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:12.475 --> 41:17.112
So what did you say to Siskel
to get him to back off?

41:17.146 --> 41:19.848
Aw, you know, just a little
hands-on interrogation.

41:19.882 --> 41:21.416
I learned it
from my partner.

41:21.450 --> 41:25.687
Ah! No more punching!
I'm sensitive.

41:25.721 --> 41:27.722
[Chuckles]

41:38.634 --> 41:41.536
We're fortunate Leena had seen
where he'd hidden it.

41:41.570 --> 41:43.938
I don't know how comfortable
I feel not telling him.

41:43.973 --> 41:46.107
It's for his own safety.
The less Arthur knows

41:46.142 --> 41:47.642
about the whereabouts
of the Astrolabe,

41:47.677 --> 41:51.546
the better it is for all of us.
Take this, and disappear.

41:51.580 --> 41:54.015
I'd rather stay here and help
you with the brotherhood.

41:54.050 --> 41:55.817
We cannot risk undoing
what Arthur did

41:55.851 --> 41:57.552
to restore the Warehouse.

41:57.586 --> 41:58.687
Yes. Well, I suppose
that wouldn't be

41:58.721 --> 42:01.389
- to my particular advantage.
- Nor mine.

42:01.424 --> 42:03.391
But that's not the point,
as you know.

42:03.426 --> 42:06.094
I'll leave Leena my research
on the dagger.

42:06.128 --> 42:07.529
It's proven quite elusive.

42:07.563 --> 42:09.998
I'll try to settle this
with the brotherhood.

42:10.032 --> 42:13.668
In the meantime, you cannot
communicate with any of us.

42:13.703 --> 42:15.737
The brotherhood will apparently
stop at nothing

42:15.771 --> 42:18.473
to force Arthur
to use the Astrolabe again.

42:20.943 --> 42:23.578
You can trust no one.
