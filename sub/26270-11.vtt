00:01.235 --> 00:03.204
ANNOUNCER: 9-1-1,
what's your emergency?

00:03.237 --> 00:05.239
This right here
is your stop.

00:05.273 --> 00:08.742
Catch all-new episodes
Mondays, and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.776 --> 00:12.012
Empire, Star, and The Resident.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.482
Let's use today
as an opportunity to
celebrate what's to come.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.749
ANNOUNCER:
Only on Fox.

00:19.387 --> 00:22.690
SADIE:
My girlfriends keep telling me
a new face won't win him back.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.159
Who says I want him back?
I don't. I want me back.

00:25.193 --> 00:28.196
Actually, I want the 35-year-old
version of me back.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.431
You think you'll be able to
knock 15 years or so off me?

00:30.464 --> 00:31.665
Without a doubt.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.567
Just don't make me look
like a duck.

00:33.601 --> 00:36.170
(power tool whirring)

00:36.204 --> 00:37.838
What are you planning
to use on me?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.573
They're just doing some
construction next door.

00:39.607 --> 00:42.376
Relax. Breathe normally.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.212
Count backwards from ten,
and when you wake up,

00:44.245 --> 00:45.513
you'll be ten years younger.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.680
Fifteen.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.216
(hammering outside)

00:48.249 --> 00:49.283
Ten,

00:49.317 --> 00:52.253
(echoing, distorting):
nine,

00:52.286 --> 00:55.323
eight, seven...

00:59.460 --> 01:01.429
-(classical piano playing)
-Are we done?

01:01.462 --> 01:05.199
Doctor? Mm.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.801
How do I look?

01:07.835 --> 01:10.238
Hello?

01:15.443 --> 01:16.610
(screaming)

01:39.333 --> 01:40.801
(phone ringing in distance)

01:40.834 --> 01:42.970
CHIMNEY:
What are we thinking?
Gas leak?

01:43.003 --> 01:44.238
HEN:
Could be some pathogen.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.274
World's a crazy place
these days.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.842
BOBBY:
Negative for combustibles
as of now.

01:48.876 --> 01:52.180
Masks stay on
for the duration.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.120
BUCK:
Where is everyone?
It's too quiet.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.197
Got one over here.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.102
She's got a pulse.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.939
Pupillary response... normal.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.175
SADIE:
Help! Please help!

02:21.209 --> 02:23.143
Please help me.

02:25.646 --> 02:29.116
Oh, help me.
They're crushing me.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.484
Okay, Buck, give me a hand
over here.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.785
Chimney, you check on her.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.787
-Wha-Wha-What's wrong?
-Stop, stop, stop!

02:33.821 --> 02:35.689
-Don't touch your face.
Don't touch your face.
-What the...?

02:35.723 --> 02:37.358
Ma'am, it just looks like
the staff here

02:37.391 --> 02:41.161
just wasn't 100% done
before they lost consciousness.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.796
You're still under the effects
of the general anesthesia,

02:42.830 --> 02:44.198
which is good.

02:44.232 --> 02:47.468
Okay, we're gonna keep you
nice and numb.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.003
But I'm gonna need to put a cold
compress on your face, okay?

02:50.037 --> 02:51.572
Is there a stitch loose?

02:51.605 --> 02:52.873
BOBBY:
Look, you're probably
gonna feel cold,

02:52.906 --> 02:54.141
but you're not gonna
feel any pain.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.143
We've got to preserve
as much tissue as possible

02:56.176 --> 02:58.246
when we travel you
to a hospital.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.681
Tissue?
Oh, my face is off!

03:00.714 --> 03:02.516
-My face is off!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.717
Same symptoms over here, Cap.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.419
She's sleeping like a baby,
but she's stable.

03:05.453 --> 03:06.987
(Sadie gasping)

03:07.020 --> 03:08.188
BOBBY:
They run the anesthesia lines

03:08.222 --> 03:10.691
through the walls
in these places, don't they?

03:10.724 --> 03:12.693
What are you thinking,
a leak or a rupture?

03:12.726 --> 03:14.428
Yeah, then why isn't she out?

03:14.462 --> 03:16.430
BOBBY:
Looks like she's receiving
oxygen from the nasal cannula.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.998
Eddie, you copy?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.534
-Yeah, Cap.
-What's your status?

03:20.568 --> 03:22.169
Found a couple more patients
in back.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.238
-Also stable.
-I'm gonna send Chim your way.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.939
You guys see if you can
locate the tank supply room.

03:25.973 --> 03:29.410
You turn anything off that's got
a knob or a valve in this place.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.379
A pipe must have busted, yeah?

03:31.412 --> 03:32.780
Probably the construction guys.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.181
You saw construction guys?

03:34.214 --> 03:36.417
I heard 'em, right before
I went under.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.552
I don't hear anything now.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.126
EDDIE:
I got this guy over here.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.361
Chimney, grab the guy
on the table.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.829
CHIMNEY:
On it.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.401
-Sir, can you hear me?
-Stable here.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.269
This one's breathing.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.073
(grunting)
This guy won't budge.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.944
EDDIE:
Cap, found our leak.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.482
Okay, let's see what
we have here.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.351
-Plugging the leak now.
-BOBBY: Copy that, Eddie.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.323
CHIMNEY:
Right. So there's that.
Hey, Eddie,

04:15.356 --> 04:17.224
I need your help over here.
Grab some tools.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.328
What do you need?
Saws? Jaws?

04:20.361 --> 04:24.598
Wrench. We'll have to
travel him with the blade.

04:25.999 --> 04:29.269
Easy. Easy.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.305
Okay, that's got to sting.

04:31.339 --> 04:35.343
MAN (weakly):
Measure twice, cut once.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.344
(groaning)

04:36.377 --> 04:38.846
Just lie still, buddy,
we got you.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.648
EDDIE:
Okay, we're good here.
Let Mercy General know

04:40.681 --> 04:41.782
we're ten out.

04:41.815 --> 04:46.119
Measure twice, cut...
(groans)

04:46.153 --> 04:49.390
Make a hole. Critical.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.197
Don't worry, we're gonna
take you to the hospital

04:57.230 --> 04:58.866
and they will fix you right up.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.300
You'll still get
your new beginning

05:00.334 --> 05:01.502
with your new face.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.572
I'd be happy if I could
just have the old one back.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.882
(door opens)

05:14.915 --> 05:16.817
We're here.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.185
Uh, they're not here yet.

05:18.218 --> 05:20.688
-Ah.
-Hey, you can still
make your escape.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.556
Uh, you know what,
just put your stuff away

05:22.590 --> 05:24.392
before your grandparents
get here.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.794
-Yeah.
-Right?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.128
Oh, this is nice.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.498
Very, very impressive.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.466
Well, impressive is what
I'm going for, so thank you.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.634
Can you stay?
Will you join us?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.469
Oh, hell no, thank you.

05:35.503 --> 05:38.706
Beatrice has never been
a fan of mine.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.808
You have no earthly idea

05:40.841 --> 05:43.544
what is about to happen
to you, do you? (laughs)

05:43.577 --> 05:46.179
Tell 'em I said hi.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.247
We're here.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.882
-Oh, man.
-HARRY: Grandma! Grandpa!

05:48.916 --> 05:51.552
-How I have missed these faces.
-(laughs)

05:51.585 --> 05:52.853
You still here?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.488
I thought you'd
drop the kids and run.

05:54.522 --> 05:55.856
Well, they wouldn't
jump out of the car

05:55.889 --> 05:58.191
-while it was still rolling.
-Oh...

05:58.225 --> 06:00.360
Remember, no matter
what happens,

06:00.394 --> 06:02.095
they leave on Saturday.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.665
(indistinct chatter)

06:04.698 --> 06:07.000
Beatrice, how you doing?
It's good to see you.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.236
Michael, what a pleasant
surprise.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.571
I didn't know you'd be here.

06:10.604 --> 06:13.907
Uh, Mama, uh, Daddy,
this is Bobby.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.476
Hi.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.880
-Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Carter.
-Oh, no need for that.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.249
Christian names'll do.
Call me Samuel.

06:22.282 --> 06:23.551
Will do.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.019
Boy, that's a good-looking
spread. (chuckles)

06:26.053 --> 06:28.689
-He living here already?
-Uh, no, ma'am.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.123
Not until after the wedding.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.059
And it's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.628
You're very... tall.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.597
So, Michael,

06:36.630 --> 06:39.700
-will your husband
be joining us?
-Oh, no.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.603
Uh, Glenn and I aren't
actually married.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.305
Mm. Of course you're
not married yet.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.641
You're barely divorced.

06:50.444 --> 06:53.781
-Uh, Saturday, you said?
-Mm-hmm.

06:53.814 --> 06:57.084
There you go.
Just keep that tight. Nice.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.753
You are on fire with that
sassy new haircut.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.889
-Sassy?
-Yeah.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.592
Okay, let's, uh, let's work on
that two-three-two combo.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.594
Okay, I want you to be ready
with that devastating hook

07:06.627 --> 07:07.761
is you ever see Doug again.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.963
Whoa. That is not why
I'm doing this.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.765
Really? You, uh,
you don't want to kick

07:11.799 --> 07:13.333
your abusive ex's ass someday?

07:13.366 --> 07:14.968
'Cause I would.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.337
I'm not doing anything
for Doug anymore, okay?

07:17.370 --> 07:19.573
This is just the next chapter
in Maddie's fresh start.

07:19.607 --> 07:22.309
Come on, haircut, apartment,

07:22.342 --> 07:24.912
dispatcher of the month.
I don't know if you heard.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.614
About a thousand times.
Come on.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.849
Oh, is that what this is about?
I'm thriving,

07:28.882 --> 07:29.950
and you can't handle it.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.286
-I'm great.
-Oh, yeah, you're doing great.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.855
You're still sleeping
in my dining room.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.324
By the way, what happened
to Earthquake Girl?

07:37.357 --> 07:38.792
Your trash talk sucks.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.327
Ali's around.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.795
We're taking it slow.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.697
She's, uh, she's in New York
on business.

07:43.731 --> 07:44.865
Why is it that
every girl you date

07:44.898 --> 07:47.000
wants to either flee the state
of the country?

07:47.034 --> 07:49.637
At least when I date someone,
I date them.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.004
What's your excuse?

07:51.038 --> 07:53.006
-What are you talking about?
-Uh-huh.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.375
-How's Chimney?
-(exhales)

07:56.677 --> 07:58.011
Chimney? We're friends.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.548
Except, ooh,
you want to date him.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.850
-I never told you that.
-Oh, you didn't have to.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.553
Your fists are saying it.
Intensity and speed

08:05.586 --> 08:09.322
notched up, like, 20%
the second I mentioned his name.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.892
Okay, easy.
Let me ask you this.

08:11.925 --> 08:15.328
You're doing so well,
you're-you're "thriving."

08:15.362 --> 08:17.731
Why can't you just date the guy?

08:17.765 --> 08:18.899
CHIMNEY:
I don't know.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.902
I mean, we like the same things,

08:21.935 --> 08:23.637
we laugh at the same jokes.

08:23.671 --> 08:27.474
Even better, she laughs
at all mine,

08:27.507 --> 08:29.743
and I'm not even that funny.

08:29.777 --> 08:33.013
You don't think she's seeing
anybody else, do you?

08:33.046 --> 08:37.184
No. I'm telling you, her ex
really did a number on her.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.920
I'm not saying he ruined her
for anybody else, but...

08:39.953 --> 08:41.755
Come on, man, no hook-ups?

08:41.789 --> 08:43.490
-No foreplay, nothing?
-No.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.727
Right now we're all awkward hugs
and funny glances.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.495
A screwball comedy
without the screw?

08:48.528 --> 08:51.599
Corner pocket.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.834
CHIMNEY:
Oh, too bad.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.670
So, maybe it's time you moved on
to greener pastures.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.071
Take the hint.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.907
Well, that's the thing about me.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.577
-I'm bad with hints.
I even suck at Pictionary.
-Yeah.

09:03.611 --> 09:06.279
You know you've been singing
the same sad song

09:06.313 --> 09:08.115
about this woman ever since
we started coming here?

09:08.148 --> 09:10.383
I'm starting to think
I should have mailed that wallet

09:10.417 --> 09:11.885
back to you after I found it,

09:11.919 --> 09:13.787
instead of returning it
in person

09:13.821 --> 09:16.423
and striking up
this misguided friendship.

09:16.456 --> 09:20.193
Well, honestly, the only reason
I keep coming here with you is

09:20.227 --> 09:23.897
I know there was a $20 bill
in that wallet when I lost it,

09:23.931 --> 09:25.465
and I'm just trying
to win it back.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.068
Ooh.

09:28.101 --> 09:32.105
* Oh, yeah. *

09:32.139 --> 09:34.307
TORRIE:
Mom, you're not
listening to me.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.043
SHELLY:
It is a little small, sure.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.712
But it's a great school.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.048
It's not small, Mom, it's tiny.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.116
I want the real
college experience.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.953
Tailgates and football games.
New scenery.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.254
You want parties.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.989
University of Miami
is a party school.

09:49.022 --> 09:52.225
I don't want parties,
I want a fresh start.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.795
A new beginning. That's why
people go away to college,

09:54.828 --> 09:57.665
to leave behind the lame-ass
they were in high school.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.733
-Honey, who called you
a lame-ass?
-(horn honking)

09:59.767 --> 10:03.036
-Mom! Mom! Look out!
-(tires screeching)

10:17.317 --> 10:19.352
(man screaming)

10:24.624 --> 10:26.626
(sirens wailing)

10:29.396 --> 10:31.665
-(man screaming)
-(indistinct chatter)

10:31.699 --> 10:34.234
LAFD. Make room!

10:39.206 --> 10:40.540
BUCK:
What the hell?

10:40.573 --> 10:42.109
WOMAN:
Tiger shark.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.610
We were transporting her
for release into the wild.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.712
Truck jackknifed.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.814
-Jaws!
-Right.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.682
Oh, right. Those Jaws. Jaws!

10:48.716 --> 10:49.683
I'm on it.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.218
(man grunting)

10:51.251 --> 10:53.286
(yelling)

10:53.320 --> 10:54.688
How'd his arm get in there?

10:54.722 --> 10:56.223
Diego was trying to get
what water was left

10:56.256 --> 10:57.324
in our pump system.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.892
She can't breathe without it!

10:58.926 --> 11:01.228
-How much time
does she have left?
-Minutes.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.130
Uh, do we wait that long
or, just, you know...

11:03.163 --> 11:04.131
No, no, don't kill her!

11:04.164 --> 11:05.866
She's come so far. (grunts)

11:05.899 --> 11:07.735
All right, guys, we're gonna
do this really carefully.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.402
All right, come on.
Let's get in there.

11:09.436 --> 11:12.706
(man continues grunting)

11:21.949 --> 11:23.383
All right, let's get him
transported, now!

11:23.416 --> 11:25.719
Nice and easy.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.188
Don't let her die.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.157
-Please.
-CHIMNEY: Breathe easy.
You're gonna be fine.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.458
Let's get him up!

11:39.399 --> 11:42.402
("Touch of Grey"
by the Grateful Dead playing)

11:48.208 --> 11:50.778
* Must be getting early *

11:50.811 --> 11:54.281
* The clocks are running late *

11:54.314 --> 11:57.350
* Paint by number morning sky *

11:57.384 --> 11:59.052
* Looks so phony *

11:59.086 --> 12:02.255
-* Dawn is breaking everywhere *
-(siren wailing)

12:02.289 --> 12:06.226
* Light a candle,
curse the glare *

12:06.259 --> 12:08.762
* Draw the curtains,
I don't care *

12:08.796 --> 12:12.399
* 'Cause it's all right *

12:12.432 --> 12:15.769
* I will get by *

12:18.939 --> 12:22.776
* I will get by *

12:24.611 --> 12:28.548
* I will get by... *

12:28.581 --> 12:30.851
* I will survive *

12:35.688 --> 12:37.891
All right, coming down quick.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.460
Here we go.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.463
Keep it steady.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.899
A little more.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.268
That's it. Keep it coming!

12:48.301 --> 12:52.139
* Sorry that you feel
that way... *

12:52.172 --> 12:53.740
That's far enough.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.477
-Halt!
-That's it, a little more slack.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.179
* Touch of grey *

12:59.212 --> 13:00.647
Careful, careful!

13:00.680 --> 13:02.983
* I will get by *

13:03.016 --> 13:05.685
Okay, she's down.
She's in the water.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.189
(quietly):
Come on, swim.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.258
You see her? Where is she?

13:11.291 --> 13:14.862
* I will survive *

13:14.895 --> 13:16.796
(laughs)

13:18.531 --> 13:21.935
* We will get by *

13:21.969 --> 13:23.536
Hey, too bad Diego
is missing it!

13:23.570 --> 13:25.438
He's not missing anything!

13:25.472 --> 13:28.942
* We will get by... *

13:28.976 --> 13:31.845
* We will survive *

13:36.649 --> 13:39.452
* We will get by. *

13:39.486 --> 13:41.788
I don't understand why
your mother would reorganize

13:41.821 --> 13:43.456
the entire kitchen
while we're at work.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.125
Oh, she said it was
impossible for her

13:45.158 --> 13:47.360
to find anything
in this kitchen.

13:47.394 --> 13:48.896
So she retaliated
by making it impossible

13:48.929 --> 13:50.030
for us to find anything?

13:50.063 --> 13:53.533
-Found it.
-Ah. Thank you.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.569
Ooh, the dress is lovely.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.838
-Very elegant. (chuckles)
-Thank you.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.908
-Did you pick that out?
-Yeah.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.642
(Samuel muttering)

14:02.675 --> 14:03.676
What is this?

14:03.710 --> 14:05.645
BOBBY:
Oh, that is Harry's
science project.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.347
Michael had that conference, so
I was helping him out with it.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.983
Harry was supposed to put it
away, but tell you what--

14:10.017 --> 14:11.418
I will move it.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.987
That boy has you
wrapped around his finger.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.322
You do know someday soon

14:15.355 --> 14:18.325
you're gonna have to go
from being best buddy Bobby

14:18.358 --> 14:19.826
to stepdad Bobby.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.828
You are right.
I will have him put it away.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.564
If you can help me find
the damn cheese grater, please.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.166
I'm sorry to interrupt, guys.

14:26.199 --> 14:30.537
Hey, Harry. I need you to clear
the table so we can eat.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.838
Okay. In a minute.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.340
No, not in a minute. Now.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.944
-Please.
-Who are you to give orders?

14:36.977 --> 14:39.412
They are not your children,

14:39.446 --> 14:41.848
and you are not their father.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.285
I was very sorry to hear
about your family's situation,

14:45.318 --> 14:49.456
but my grandchildren
are not your consolation prize.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.458
-Kids.
-I'm sorry, I...

14:53.260 --> 14:54.894
(door closes in distance)

14:54.928 --> 14:56.563
Apologize, Mama.

14:56.596 --> 14:57.697
BOBBY:
It's all right, Athena,

14:57.730 --> 14:59.232
-she doesn't have...
-Yeah, she does.

14:59.266 --> 15:03.203
If she wants to stay
in this house tonight, she does.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.538
(takes deep breath)

15:05.572 --> 15:08.942
I'm sorry I said that
in front of the children.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.277
You shouldn't have
said it at all.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.445
It is none of your business.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.549
I am tired

15:16.583 --> 15:19.419
of you deciding
what's my business, Athena.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.221
You didn't tell me
you were seeing this man,

15:21.254 --> 15:22.389
much less that he proposed.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.057
Just like last year.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.625
My baby May almost died,

15:25.658 --> 15:27.995
and you didn't say a word
for over a month?

15:28.028 --> 15:30.663
Because she is not
your baby girl. She's mine.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.399
And Michael and I needed

15:32.432 --> 15:35.135
to focus all of our energy
and our attention on her,

15:35.168 --> 15:37.137
-not you.
-I would have wanted to help.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.805
You never want to help.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.774
You just want to tell me
where I screwed up.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.843
Because you never learn.

15:43.876 --> 15:47.080
You just jump into everything
without thinking it through,

15:47.114 --> 15:49.449
without considering
the consequences.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.451
"I'm gonna move to Los Angeles."

15:51.484 --> 15:53.453
"I'm gonna drop out
of law school."

15:53.486 --> 15:54.787
"I'm gonna become a cop."

15:54.821 --> 15:56.356
"I'm gonna marry a gay man."

15:56.389 --> 15:57.991
"I'm gonna marry a white man."

15:58.025 --> 15:59.259
Sometimes I think

15:59.292 --> 16:01.661
it's a miracle
those kids are alive...

16:01.694 --> 16:03.530
-(stammering)
-Okay, that's enough.

16:03.563 --> 16:04.797
SAMUEL:
Bobby's right.

16:04.831 --> 16:07.367
Now, we all
should just take a minute,

16:07.400 --> 16:09.336
let things calm down.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.172
Sir, with all due respect,

16:12.205 --> 16:15.308
I have to say that your daughter
is an amazing woman

16:15.342 --> 16:17.144
and a damn good mother,

16:17.177 --> 16:19.312
and she does not deserve
to be spoken to

16:19.346 --> 16:21.048
that way in her own home.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.016
Your mother was out of line.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.851
Bea...

16:24.884 --> 16:27.320
I think you should
say something to your daughter.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.395
(sighs)

16:37.397 --> 16:40.067
We'll leave in the morning.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.102
*

16:51.678 --> 16:55.515
-911. What is your emergency?
-BOY: Um... hi.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.717
Hello? This is 911.
Who's this?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.052
Um, Stevie.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.553
Okay, Stevie, my name is Maddie.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.155
Where are you calling from?

17:02.189 --> 17:05.392
Our house.
1963 Aldrich Drive, Glendale.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.526
What's going on?

17:06.559 --> 17:07.827
It's... it's my dad.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.862
Your dad? Is he hurt?

17:09.896 --> 17:11.098
What? No.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.765
No, he did a bad thing.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.501
Stevie, are you hurt?

17:14.534 --> 17:15.902
Me? No.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.437
-It's, uh...
-MAN: Stevie!

17:17.470 --> 17:21.341
Give me that phone!
(continues indistinctly)

17:21.374 --> 17:22.542
Hi. Who is this?

17:22.575 --> 17:24.711
This is 911 emergency services.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.746
You called 911?

17:26.779 --> 17:28.748
(sighs) Oh, boy.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.518
This is a little embarrassing,
but my son here,

17:31.551 --> 17:35.021
he got himself into some
trouble, and now he's grounded,

17:35.054 --> 17:37.190
and apparently that constitutes
a life-and-death situation

17:37.224 --> 17:39.126
when you're 13 years old.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.728
I can't tell you how sorry I am
that we wasted your time.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.297
It happens. Uh, are you sure
that everyone's okay?

17:44.331 --> 17:46.766
No, yeah, everyone's fine.
Yes, thank you.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.235
Although I know
somebody whose grounding

17:48.268 --> 17:49.702
just got a little bit longer.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.304
Sorry to have bothered you.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.972
(line clicks)

17:57.510 --> 17:58.945
Hey.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.114
So, I kind of got
a disturbing call.

18:01.148 --> 18:04.050
-Disturbing how?
-Well, it was a kid who said

18:04.083 --> 18:05.552
that his dad
had done something bad,

18:05.585 --> 18:07.320
but before he could tell me
what happened,

18:07.354 --> 18:09.622
the dad got on the line
and said that the kid

18:09.656 --> 18:11.291
had been grounded
and it was nothing.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.892
And you think there
was more to it than that?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.461
Honestly...

18:14.494 --> 18:16.263
I'm not sure.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.465
Well, why don't you request
a welfare check.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.100
Have the police take a look,
see if Dad's story checks out,

18:21.134 --> 18:22.769
give yourself
some peace of mind.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.437
Right.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.443
And stop questioning
your instincts.

18:30.477 --> 18:33.913
You're coming into your own
without even realizing it.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.615
Thank you.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.088
(doorbell rings)

18:42.121 --> 18:44.123
(indistinct radio chatter)

18:52.399 --> 18:55.768
-Oh, you got to be kidding me.
-Mr. Eric Parnell?

18:55.802 --> 18:58.671
-That's right.
-I'm Sergeant Grant
for the LAPD.

18:58.705 --> 19:01.107
I'm here to follow up on a 911
call made from this address.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.609
May I come in?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.411
Sure. Of course. Please.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.783
Can't believe they really
sent someone out for this.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.220
I explained to the 911 operator
that my son...

19:13.253 --> 19:14.687
Sir, where is your son?

19:14.721 --> 19:16.789
I'd like to speak with him
if I could.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.790
Sure.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.359
Just a minute.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.183
ERIC:
Sergeant?

19:48.221 --> 19:50.257
Stevie, this is Sergeant Grant.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.759
Do you know why she's here?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.227
Because I called 911?

19:54.261 --> 19:55.995
Because you called 911.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.065
Sir, I'd like to speak
with your son for a minute.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.467
Alone.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.270
Of course.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.606
I'll go unload the dishwasher.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.944
Why don't we talk outside?

20:11.978 --> 20:14.180
Stevie...

20:14.213 --> 20:16.749
I want you to know
you're not in any trouble.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.886
I'm just here to make sure
that you're okay.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.954
Because if you're not--
if you need help--

20:21.988 --> 20:24.056
all you have to do is say so.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.558
I'm here to help.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.126
I'm okay.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.762
I was just mad.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.664
At your father?

20:32.665 --> 20:34.767
You want to tell me why?

20:36.002 --> 20:38.137
He wants to change stuff.

20:38.170 --> 20:41.007
I liked things
the way that they were.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.476
But he, uh...

20:43.510 --> 20:45.312
He what?

20:46.346 --> 20:49.382
He wasn't happy with me.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.651
He... I got scared.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.820
I see.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.589
It's just you
and your father, is it?

20:57.824 --> 20:59.392
Okay. Well...

20:59.426 --> 21:03.062
you know calling 911's
a serious thing, right?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.331
Yeah.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.499
Which is why I have to wonder

21:06.533 --> 21:08.501
if maybe the reason you called

21:08.535 --> 21:11.170
is a little more serious
than just being grounded.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.573
No, no, that's all it was.
I swear.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.775
Please, you just have to tell
my dad that everything's okay.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.244
I-I just don't want him
to be mad at me anymore.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.146
I understand, I do.

21:20.179 --> 21:24.283
Our parents' approval
is something that we all crave.

21:24.317 --> 21:27.987
We just can't let it stop us
from doing the right thing.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.288
Understand?

21:29.322 --> 21:32.525
-I-I think so.
-All right.

21:32.559 --> 21:35.328
If you in trouble,
you can always call for help,

21:35.362 --> 21:38.365
or if you need some help
trying to figure out

21:38.398 --> 21:40.867
the right thing to do,
you can call me directly.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.669
I won't need to.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.173
So...

21:47.206 --> 21:48.875
everything good?

21:48.908 --> 21:50.843
Or will you be taking my son
into custody?

21:50.877 --> 21:54.481
No, everything's just fine.
Thank you for your cooperation.

21:54.514 --> 21:57.116
Anytime. Stevie?

21:57.149 --> 21:59.519
-ATHENA: Bye, Stevie.
-Bye.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.053
Have a nice day, Sergeant.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.289
You, too, sir.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.724
So he seemed fine?

22:04.757 --> 22:07.527
Well, I said there were no marks
on him that I could see,

22:07.560 --> 22:09.829
but fine? I'm not so sure.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.631
That's why I want
to hear the call.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.332
MADDIE (recorded):
Wait, Stevie, are you hurt?

22:13.366 --> 22:15.201
STEVIE:
Me? No. It's, uh...

22:15.234 --> 22:17.537
ERIC:
Stevie, give me that phone.

22:17.570 --> 22:18.871
Go back.

22:18.905 --> 22:21.541
ERIC:
Stevie, give me that phone.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.643
Right there, in the background,

22:23.676 --> 22:25.612
before the dad
comes to the phone.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.383
ERIC:
Stevie, give me that phone.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.918
Stay here,
don't touch anything.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.820
So someone else
was in the house?

22:33.853 --> 22:36.222
The boy said it was
just him and his dad.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.865
You gonna behave?

22:45.898 --> 22:47.266
NEWSWOMAN (over TV):
Firefighters
and paramedics responded

22:47.299 --> 22:48.935
after the patient woke
from anesthesia

22:48.968 --> 22:51.538
to find the operating
surgeon and nurses

22:51.571 --> 22:53.172
passed out on the floor.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.875
The gas leak was quickly
sealed off at the facility.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.945
Most of the victims suffered
only minor injuries. However,

22:58.978 --> 23:00.279
one construction worker...

23:00.312 --> 23:02.849
-ERIC: You sit here, Noah.
-My name's not Noah.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.384
-It is now.
-NEWSWOMAN: Both are now
in stable condition.

23:05.418 --> 23:09.121
The search continues
for a lost child

23:09.155 --> 23:10.690
-in Orange County tonight.
-Stevie.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.592
-Stevie, turn that off.
-Six-year-old Brian Gallagher

23:12.625 --> 23:14.927
was last seen outside
the church his family attends

23:14.961 --> 23:18.064
in Dana Point, California.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.733
Police are asking for your help
in finding the missing boy.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.435
If you have any information,
please submit

23:22.469 --> 23:25.271
a tip to the Orange County
Crime Stoppers through

23:25.304 --> 23:28.074
their website or through
the number on your screen.

23:32.479 --> 23:35.081
ROMERO:
Eric Lawrence Parnell. 42.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.584
Single. Works as
a freelance I.T. guy.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.986
Grew up at this address.
Mom died in '03,

23:40.019 --> 23:41.921
left him the house.
He's clean, Sergeant.

23:41.954 --> 23:45.592
Mm, mm-hmm.
Clean, or maybe just careful.

23:45.625 --> 23:46.826
And the son?

23:46.859 --> 23:49.228
ROMERO:
Steven Parnell. 13.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.497
Enrolled at Los Nietos

23:50.530 --> 23:54.300
Middle School. Counselor says
he's a average student.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.302
Quiet. Keeps to himself.

23:56.335 --> 23:58.671
Except when he's calling 911.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.406
So what do you think's going on
in that house, Sergeant?

24:00.439 --> 24:01.608
I don't know yet,

24:01.641 --> 24:03.776
but I got a gut feeling
something ain't right.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.144
Well, your gut's

24:05.177 --> 24:08.280
good enough for me,
but, um, there's no reason

24:08.314 --> 24:10.583
for you to be sitting out here
staring at the man's garbage.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.251
Me and my guys can handle this.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.086
I'm sure you'd rather be home
with the family.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.522
No, I'm good.

24:15.555 --> 24:18.658
My mother's in town.
She said she's leaving,

24:18.691 --> 24:21.427
but she can't seem
to find a flight out.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.663
Ah.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.470
Got it.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.205
See you back
at the station, Billy.

24:34.373 --> 24:36.943
Anything in particular you think
we should be looking for?

24:36.976 --> 24:38.144
No. Nothing in particular,

24:38.177 --> 24:40.046
-just let me know what you find.
-You got it.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.954
BOBBY:
I didn't know what to say.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.189
I figured I should stay out
of it, but then...

24:50.222 --> 24:52.659
Mama got mean.
(chuckles)

24:52.692 --> 24:55.461
Look, there's a whole spectrum

24:55.494 --> 24:56.863
of mom A-types.

24:56.896 --> 25:00.466
You got the cool mom,
you got the helicopter mom,

25:00.499 --> 25:04.003
you got the tiger mom,
and then you got Beatrice.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.504
Yeah, terrifying mom.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.740
She named her daughter
after a Greek god.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.375
Yeah, Athena, goddess of wisdom.

25:09.408 --> 25:11.343
And war.

25:11.377 --> 25:14.046
Also the goddess of crafting,
but that's a whole other story.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.716
(chuckles) The point is,

25:16.749 --> 25:18.585
Beatrice had big dreams
for Athena

25:18.618 --> 25:20.753
and even bigger expectations,

25:20.787 --> 25:22.488
but she knows how
this world works.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.191
How hard Athena would
have to fight for everything.

25:25.224 --> 25:28.027
So child-rearing was less
about raising a daughter

25:28.060 --> 25:30.162
and more like
training a warrior.

25:30.196 --> 25:33.165
So, no shopping trips,
manicures,

25:33.199 --> 25:35.367
and long talks over cups of tea?

25:35.401 --> 25:38.070
(laughs)
Maybe in a TV commercial.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.371
But in real life?

25:39.405 --> 25:42.208
No one gets under their
daughter's skin like a mom.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.543
Well, what am I supposed to do,
just forget it?

25:44.577 --> 25:47.079
Just forget all the mean things
she said to her?

25:47.113 --> 25:51.250
Bobby, you said your piece.

25:51.283 --> 25:54.353
You had Athena's back.
Props to you, by the way.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.888
But, yeah.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.557
They'll work it out,
or they won't.

25:58.591 --> 26:00.593
Either way, you do not want
to be the man

26:00.627 --> 26:02.528
standing between them.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.697
You'll get cut down
in the crossfire.

26:04.731 --> 26:08.200
Your mother ever say those kind
of terrible things to you?

26:08.234 --> 26:10.236
Oh, no, no, no. My mother,

26:10.269 --> 26:14.240
she said a whole bunch of
different other terrible things.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.775
And you forgave her?

26:15.808 --> 26:18.477
She's my mother.

26:18.510 --> 26:20.179
(grunts softly)

26:23.249 --> 26:25.785
(indistinct chatter)

26:28.320 --> 26:29.656
Hey.

26:29.689 --> 26:32.659
What are you doing here?
Looking for Buck?

26:32.692 --> 26:34.661
No, actually, I came to see you,

26:34.694 --> 26:38.097
-give you this.
-Oh. Okay.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.601
Divorce papers?

26:42.635 --> 26:44.603
-This feels so sudden.
-(chuckles)

26:45.972 --> 26:49.308
This is, uh,
a really big step, Maddie.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.110
I mean, he's gonna know
where you are.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.311
You sure about this?

26:52.344 --> 26:54.814
Yeah, I know it's a risk.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.249
But the only way
I'm ever gonna feel free of him

26:57.283 --> 26:58.951
is to be free of him.

26:58.985 --> 27:02.755
Okay. If you're sure, then,
uh, I'm here for you,

27:02.789 --> 27:04.523
whatever you need.

27:04.556 --> 27:07.794
Well, you told me once that
your calendar was wide open,

27:07.827 --> 27:09.495
when I was ready.

27:09.528 --> 27:12.665
Just, uh, name
the date and time.

27:12.699 --> 27:16.202
-Friday, 7:00 p.m.
-Actually, I'm kind of busy.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.270
I'm kidding.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.672
Yes. I can't wait.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.640
-Okay.
-(laughs)

27:21.674 --> 27:24.643
-Okay. I'll see you
Friday night.
-Friday.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.351
(whistling, applause)

27:33.886 --> 27:36.022
Well played, well played.

27:43.562 --> 27:45.564
(ringtone playing)

27:47.900 --> 27:49.401
Hey.

27:49.435 --> 27:52.571
Uh, sorry, I got to cancel
our thing on Friday.

27:52.604 --> 27:56.342
-You got to work?
-No, actually, um,

27:56.375 --> 27:58.177
it's Maddie.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.646
She asked me out on a date.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.915
Wow.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.917
-I guess I was wrong about her.
-Yeah.

28:04.951 --> 28:07.987
Uh, sorry again. So, drinks
are on me next time I see you.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.188
No worries.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.423
I'm sure we'll be seeing
each other real soon.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.892
Okay. See you.

28:16.562 --> 28:18.998
-You find anything interesting?
-Only this.

28:19.031 --> 28:22.701
ATHENA:
Mm-hmm, ladies' hair dye.
Black hair dye.

28:22.735 --> 28:24.837
Probably explains the substance
you found in the sink.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.873
You spoke to the boy,
his hair look dyed to you?

28:26.906 --> 28:29.708
No. And unless it caused
Parnell's to fall out,

28:29.742 --> 28:32.711
it wasn't his either.
Sketchy, but not grounds

28:32.745 --> 28:34.346
for a warrant.

28:34.380 --> 28:38.517
And probably what's not got you
so excited to call me down here.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.386
We pulled prints, we got a hit,

28:40.419 --> 28:42.588
but not Eric Parnell's.
The son.

28:42.621 --> 28:45.557
You telling me little
Stevie Parnell is a felon?

28:45.591 --> 28:48.060
No, I'm telling you Stevie
Parnell is not Stevie Parnell.

28:48.094 --> 28:50.897
His real name
is Jacob Daniel Walters,

28:50.930 --> 28:53.232
and he went missing
in Merced, California in 2012.

28:53.265 --> 28:54.433
Snatched off the streets.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.302
He was six years old.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.570
-My God.
-Yup. The original investigators

28:58.604 --> 28:59.972
pulled Jacob's prints
back in the day.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.307
It's a match, no doubt about it.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.109
What now?

29:05.644 --> 29:07.113
Let's go.
Move, move, move.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.584
Bravo in position.

29:12.618 --> 29:14.253
Bravo, ready.

29:14.286 --> 29:15.855
Alpha in position.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.457
Go, go, move.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.161
Clear.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.597
Clear.

29:25.631 --> 29:26.732
All clear.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.435
-All clear.
-Place is empty.

29:29.468 --> 29:30.970
-Gone?
-Yeah.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.806
(sighs) We'll put out
an Amber Alert.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.507
Your visit must've spooked him.

29:35.541 --> 29:36.843
He didn't look
spooked last night

29:36.876 --> 29:39.511
when we were sitting outside.
You think he made us?

29:39.545 --> 29:40.646
Sergeant.

29:40.679 --> 29:42.381
-Yeah?
-You should see this.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.359
Doesn't look like
a 13-year-old's

29:53.392 --> 29:54.693
been sleeping here.

29:54.726 --> 29:57.496
How old did you say Stevie was
when Parnell took him?

29:57.529 --> 29:59.598
-ROMERO: Six.
-Then your Amber Alert

29:59.631 --> 30:02.534
should specify adult male
traveling with two minor boys,

30:02.568 --> 30:04.370
one 13...

30:04.403 --> 30:06.138
and the other probably six.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.412
-(indistinct chatter)
-(camera shutter clicking)

30:16.248 --> 30:18.250
Let me take a look at that.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.191
Thanks.

30:25.224 --> 30:28.127
ROMERO:
Yeah.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.029
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.231
Just checked with the boy's
school-- he never made it.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.800
Amber Alert's gone out,
and we may even have

30:34.833 --> 30:36.035
ID on the second victim.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.736
A six-year-old boy was abducted

30:37.769 --> 30:40.139
three days ago in Dana Point.
Brian Gallagher.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.009
I think you should clear your
people out of here, Detective,

30:43.042 --> 30:45.144
and get anything marked
off the street.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.179
I'm not convinced this man fled.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.515
I mean, I think maybe
he just went out.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.250
He didn't take anything
out of the closet

30:51.283 --> 30:53.185
or the prescriptions
in the kitchen cabinet.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.922
-Maybe he was in a hurry.
-That could be,

30:55.955 --> 30:59.358
but I think something else
is going on here,

30:59.391 --> 31:01.560
just not sure what.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.867
There's a caller by the name
of Stevie Parnell on the line.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.203
He's asking for you.

31:11.237 --> 31:15.007
Maddie, the boy's currently
the subject of an Amber Alert.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.943
MADDIE:
Stevie?

31:16.976 --> 31:18.844
STEVIE:
Is this the 911 lady
I talked to before?

31:18.877 --> 31:21.847
I... Yes, this is Maddie.
Stevie, where are you right now?

31:21.880 --> 31:24.250
Uh, I'm not sure.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.218
I'm in a train station.
I'm lost.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.620
I need to talk to that police
lady that you sent to our house.

31:28.654 --> 31:29.788
I... I can't remember her name.

31:29.821 --> 31:31.357
-Sergeant Grant.
-Yeah.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.425
-She's a friend of mine.
-Yeah, I need to talk to her.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.194
I'm getting her on the line,
but I need you

31:35.227 --> 31:36.595
to try and tell me
where you are.

31:36.628 --> 31:38.130
I think we got off
on the wrong train.

31:38.164 --> 31:39.531
I-I tried to take us
to Dana Point.

31:39.565 --> 31:40.967
We? Is your father with you?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.969
No, no, no, please.
You cannot let him find us.

31:44.803 --> 31:48.540
(phone vibrating)

31:48.574 --> 31:50.576
This is Sergeant Grant.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.979
Athena, it's Maddie. I've got
Stevie Parnell on the line.

31:53.012 --> 31:55.481
Stevie called you?

31:55.514 --> 31:59.085
Actually, he was trying to call
you. I'll put him on now.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.753
-Stevie?
-Sorry. I-I should have said

32:01.787 --> 32:03.155
something when you came
to see me.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.724
-I was just so scared.
-ATHENA: I know, baby.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.793
STEVIE:
But I really am trying
to do the right thing.

32:07.826 --> 32:10.429
Honey, is little Brian with you?

32:10.462 --> 32:12.398
I'm sorry. He lied.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.266
Who did? Who lied?

32:14.300 --> 32:16.668
My dad. He said that Noah's
parents didn't want him,

32:16.702 --> 32:19.271
and that's why he was gonna
be my new brother, but...

32:19.305 --> 32:21.640
I knew it was a lie.
I-I tried to say something.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.109
I know you did.

32:23.142 --> 32:26.078
-Where's your dad right now?
-I'm not sure.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.513
We left while he was asleep.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.982
I was trying to take Noah home
but I just got so turned around.

32:30.016 --> 32:32.851
(phone beeping)

32:32.884 --> 32:35.487
Stevie?

32:35.521 --> 32:37.323
(phone beeping)

32:38.857 --> 32:41.293
Oh, no. He found us.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.461
Stevie.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.296
Stevie!

32:45.531 --> 32:47.466
Let's go.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.835
Stevie!

32:49.868 --> 32:54.140
Stevie! Stevie!

32:54.173 --> 32:56.042
What station
was he calling from?

32:56.075 --> 32:57.043
We pinged him
at North Hollywood.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.777
I've alerted
metro police and LAPD.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.179
Units have been dispatched.

33:00.212 --> 33:02.381
The next train at that station--
where's it coming from?

33:02.414 --> 33:04.150
Universal City Station.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.184
That's half a mile away.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.086
(siren wailing)

33:11.190 --> 33:12.958
Very disappointed
in you, Stevie.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.194
What if somebody saw... what if
your little brother got hurt?

33:15.227 --> 33:16.662
He's not my little brother.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.681
OFFICER:
Dispatch, suspect has a weapon.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.216
We've got a hostage situation
unfolding here.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.051
DISPATCHER:
All units on scene,

33:39.085 --> 33:40.719
general stand-down order
in effect.

33:40.752 --> 33:41.987
Do not engage suspect.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.423
Repeat: do not engage suspect.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.458
(train horn blowing)

33:51.797 --> 33:54.100
And you stay back!

33:54.133 --> 33:55.434
Stay there!

33:58.637 --> 34:00.772
You stay there!

34:05.043 --> 34:07.879
This right here is your stop.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.882
(grunts)

34:10.916 --> 34:12.551
-OFFICER: Grab the knife!
-(shushing)

34:12.584 --> 34:14.353
(Eric groaning)

34:14.386 --> 34:16.522
Don't worry.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.457
-You're safe now. I got you.
-Do not resist!

34:18.490 --> 34:20.092
I got you both.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.880
Parents are on their way.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.715
He's doing pretty good,
all things considered, huh?

34:43.749 --> 34:46.252
Yeah, kids that age
are pretty resilient.

34:46.285 --> 34:49.588
He's not the one
I'm worried about.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.490
ROMERO:
What about his folks?
Do they know?

34:51.523 --> 34:53.125
Local PD drove over.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.727
The mother had a panic attack
when she saw them.

34:55.761 --> 34:59.965
She thought they were there
to make a death notification.

34:59.998 --> 35:02.801
ROMERO:
So, what are you gonna tell him?

35:02.834 --> 35:04.836
(sighs)

35:10.676 --> 35:13.179
He's not my dad, is he?

35:15.447 --> 35:18.617
No. He's not.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.887
Your real father and mother
are on their way.

35:25.991 --> 35:28.294
Does she have curly hair?

35:28.327 --> 35:30.929
Your mom?

35:30.962 --> 35:33.932
I used to have this dream
when I was little.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.934
There was a house

35:35.967 --> 35:38.170
with a big porch and...

35:38.204 --> 35:40.639
and a lady.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.641
She had curly hair.

35:42.674 --> 35:45.977
I'd pull on it and she'd laugh.

35:46.011 --> 35:48.314
But my dad--

35:48.347 --> 35:51.650
I mean... Eric--

35:51.683 --> 35:55.487
he... he said it wasn't real.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.127
ATHENA:
Your real name

36:02.160 --> 36:05.297
is Jacob Daniel Walters.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.399
You were six when he took you.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.936
You were playing outside.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.841
Your mother heard
the phone ring.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.043
She was gone
less than a minute.

36:18.076 --> 36:21.012
But that's all it took.

36:22.381 --> 36:26.318
Eric stole you
in broad daylight.

36:26.352 --> 36:27.586
Oh, my God. Oh!

36:27.619 --> 36:30.422
He drove you hundreds
of miles away from home

36:30.456 --> 36:33.091
so they could never find you.

36:33.124 --> 36:34.360
(laughing)

36:36.262 --> 36:38.697
Your parents looked for you

36:38.730 --> 36:41.567
for years.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.270
They never gave up.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.841
STEVIE:
They may remember me,

36:49.875 --> 36:52.010
but I don't remember them.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.512
Not really.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.914
ATHENA:
They're your family.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.450
They love you either way.

36:58.484 --> 37:01.920
And you have the rest
of your life ahead of you.

37:01.953 --> 37:06.258
You can make new,
happy memories with them.

37:06.292 --> 37:10.729
-Hi.
-Hi.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.764
(indistinct chatter)

37:15.267 --> 37:18.270
ATHENA:
This is your new beginning.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.457
(grill sizzling)

37:40.258 --> 37:42.160
Mom! We saw you on TV.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.062
-On the news.
-(chuckles) You did?

37:44.095 --> 37:45.964
Saving the day
and saving those boys.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.566
MAY:
Are they gonna be okay?

37:47.599 --> 37:50.336
They said the older boy had been
with that man a long time.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.671
I think so.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.506
I hope so.

37:54.540 --> 37:57.075
-He's been through enough.
-(chuckles)

37:57.108 --> 37:58.410
Hell of a job, Sergeant Grant.

37:58.444 --> 38:01.480
Oh. Thank you, Captain.

38:04.149 --> 38:06.452
Okay, looks like
we're ready to eat.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.887
Just need a minute.

38:39.585 --> 38:42.020
Tanya Kingston.

38:43.355 --> 38:46.725
I saw you on television
with those boys

38:46.758 --> 38:49.728
and thought of her.

38:49.761 --> 38:52.698
The men searching
the woods for her,

38:52.731 --> 38:56.402
all in a line...

38:57.769 --> 39:00.739
finding nothing
but that barrette.

39:07.513 --> 39:10.315
I never knew why

39:10.348 --> 39:12.984
you wanted this job.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.754
Maybe I get it
a little more today.

39:19.958 --> 39:23.695
I know you think I don't
understand your life.

39:23.729 --> 39:26.932
But you never understood
mine, either.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.501
I met a man, fell in love,

39:29.535 --> 39:34.039
made a home and raised
a beautiful daughter

39:34.072 --> 39:36.207
who ran away from us
the first chance she got

39:36.241 --> 39:39.210
and hasn't stopped
running since.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.682
Lately, feels like

39:43.715 --> 39:46.284
you and I are rushing,

39:46.317 --> 39:49.087
racing to some finish line.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.723
Will I die and leave you first?

39:51.757 --> 39:54.392
Or will I live long enough

39:54.426 --> 39:59.431
to discover you've completely
turned away from me?

40:02.668 --> 40:06.472
Maybe I was running.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.507
But not away.

40:11.643 --> 40:14.746
This family, this job--

40:14.780 --> 40:16.915
that's what I was
running towards.

40:16.948 --> 40:20.919
Mama, I needed to find a place
with space big enough

40:20.952 --> 40:23.822
where I could build a life
that was important to me.

40:23.855 --> 40:26.825
I want you to be a part of that.

40:26.858 --> 40:30.061
But only if you can accept
all of it.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.763
Even Bobby.

40:33.999 --> 40:35.967
I love you, baby,

40:36.001 --> 40:39.404
but you're making
a terrible mistake.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.507
And I worry

40:41.540 --> 40:44.943
that the next time
your life falls apart,

40:44.976 --> 40:48.614
you won't be able
to put it back together.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.291
(phone vibrating)

41:10.135 --> 41:11.870
-Donna?
-DONNA: Hey, Maddie, it's me.

41:11.903 --> 41:14.506
Hey. Uh, how did it go?

41:14.540 --> 41:16.274
Did you guys serve Doug
with the divorce papers?

41:16.307 --> 41:17.475
No.

41:17.509 --> 41:19.945
Maddie, we can't find him.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.113
-(doorbell buzzes)
-Wait, what?

41:22.147 --> 41:24.115
The process server made
multiple attempts.

41:24.149 --> 41:27.218
Talked to his neighbors.
Nobody's seen Doug for months.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.621
Okay, that doesn't
make any sense.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.456
Did you try his work?

41:31.489 --> 41:33.191
DONNA:
He was asked to take some
personal time,

41:33.224 --> 41:35.460
after he paid your old boss
a visit.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.529
He was convinced
she knew where you were.

41:37.563 --> 41:39.164
It got physical.

41:39.197 --> 41:42.500
Laurie?
Oh, my God. How bad?

41:42.534 --> 41:45.837
-DONNA: She's okay. Security
showed up and Doug ran.
-(knife clicks)

41:45.871 --> 41:47.338
But nobody's seen him since.

41:48.373 --> 41:50.375
(Chimney grunting)

41:52.510 --> 41:56.081
It's like a nightmare.
Except I never wake up.

41:56.114 --> 41:58.383
DONNA:
I have investigators
looking for him.

41:58.416 --> 42:00.586
But be careful, Maddie.

42:00.619 --> 42:02.821
Thanks.

42:02.854 --> 42:06.424
(sighs)
You are not gonna believe this.

42:06.457 --> 42:08.694
-Hey, babe.
-Doug.

I took the thing
that you value most,

43:27.773 --> 43:29.975
and I toyed with it
for my own entertainment.
