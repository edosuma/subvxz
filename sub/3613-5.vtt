00:17.392 --> 00:20.145
Are your parents terrorists?
Because, baby, you're the bomb.

00:20.312 --> 00:23.023
Jim, Jim.
Ask if it hurt when she fell.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.983
- Excuse me?
- When you fell from heaven.

00:25.150 --> 00:28.820
Did it hurt? Because I know
an angel when I see one.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.241
I'm no angel. I'm a witch.

00:33.867 --> 00:37.287
But don't tell my sisters I told you.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.999
Oh, I'm so glad
you guys are still here.

00:41.666 --> 00:43.293
What are you staring at?

00:43.460 --> 00:46.588
They have been going at it
for almost an hour.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.381
Hello.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.345
I can't even look.

00:53.553 --> 00:54.888
I know. I hate being single.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.639
Waitress coming through.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.225
Special delivery.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.561
- Hey, Skye.
- Hey, Skye.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.146
Hi.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.817
I think there's been some mistake.
I didn't order this.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.195
I know. You have a secret admirer.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.071
He ordered it for you.

01:15.950 --> 01:17.577
- Who is that?
- I have no idea.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.079
I'm just following
the bartender's orders.

01:20.246 --> 01:24.083
And apparently,
he's been eyeing Prue all night.

01:25.209 --> 01:27.712
Skye, can you do me a favour?

01:27.879 --> 01:31.049
Tell him thank you and I'm flattered,
but I'm kind of seeing someone else.

01:31.215 --> 01:33.134
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:33.926 --> 01:35.845
This is a nice change of attitude.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.557
I'll say. Does this mean you're thinking
of getting serious with Andy?

01:39.724 --> 01:41.726
Lately, I've been thinking
about a lot of things.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.108
- She didn't want the drink?
- I'm sorry, no.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.360
She's flattered,
she's just seeing someone else.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.988
Yeah, sure she is.

01:54.155 --> 01:59.160
How about you? Maybe you'd like
to have a drink with me sometime?

01:59.368 --> 02:02.330
Oh, well, that's really sweet of you,

02:02.538 --> 02:06.125
but I'm not allowed
to date the customers.

02:07.668 --> 02:09.836
- Skye.
- An order's up,

02:10.003 --> 02:12.298
so I've gotta run.

02:47.374 --> 02:49.418
Hello, Skye.

02:49.585 --> 02:51.295
What the...?

02:53.046 --> 02:56.925
You're in my world now, Skye.

03:03.432 --> 03:05.267
You look beautiful in that dress.

03:06.310 --> 03:07.811
I knew you would.

03:09.021 --> 03:11.023
I don't understand.

03:11.189 --> 03:14.735
It's your dream,
but it's my fantasy.

03:14.943 --> 03:16.820
Where am I?

03:18.864 --> 03:22.117
You're dreaming. I'm visiting.

03:22.326 --> 03:25.579
- You're in my dream?
- Yes.

03:25.746 --> 03:28.165
But I can make it mine.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.252
You can walk.

03:32.419 --> 03:36.923
In dreams, I can do anything.

03:41.303 --> 03:44.181
I can dance in your dreams.

03:49.769 --> 03:53.189
I can alter your dreams.

04:06.327 --> 04:08.037
Hey.

04:10.957 --> 04:14.210
And I can kill you in your dreams.

04:14.836 --> 04:17.714
No, please.

04:21.801 --> 04:26.514
Did you know that if you die
in your dreams, you die in real life?

04:28.308 --> 04:30.893
- Please don't hurt me!
- Please don't hurt me!

04:32.729 --> 04:35.648
No, Skye, you rejected me.

04:35.815 --> 04:38.443
And now you gotta pay.

04:38.609 --> 04:41.404
- Please, I'll do anything!
- Please, I'll do anything!

04:43.448 --> 04:45.032
Sweet dreams.

06:30.637 --> 06:31.972
What have we got here?

06:32.139 --> 06:36.309
Her name is Skye Russell, early 20s.
She's a waitress at Quake.

06:36.476 --> 06:39.146
Every bone in her body's
been crushed.

06:39.729 --> 06:43.608
Coroner said it's as if she had
fallen off a 20-story building.

06:44.651 --> 06:47.195
But we're inside an apartment...

06:47.821 --> 06:50.115
...on the ground floor...

06:52.200 --> 06:54.160
...and her body hasn't been moved.

06:59.624 --> 07:04.921
<i>Keep going.
And press and press and press.</i>

07:05.088 --> 07:08.466
<i>Keep working it through.
And press.</i>

07:08.633 --> 07:12.929
I give up. Two weeks, and nothing's
strengthened but my temper.

07:13.096 --> 07:16.224
Piper, here's the problem.
You didn't read the fine print.

07:16.391 --> 07:19.185
See, it says right here,
$19.95 for the video

07:19.352 --> 07:21.187
and 20 grand for the plastic surgeon.

07:21.396 --> 07:22.772
Yeah, well, it's worked.

07:22.981 --> 07:26.359
She's the most desired female
in America, what every man wants.

07:26.901 --> 07:29.404
Of course men want her.
Men are no different from women.

07:29.571 --> 07:30.905
We all want what we can't have.

07:31.072 --> 07:33.575
Which is why we need to stop
thinking about what men want

07:33.741 --> 07:35.618
and start thinking about
what we want in a man.

07:35.910 --> 07:38.746
Tons of fun, lots of heat and no
strings attached. That's what I want.

07:39.998 --> 07:44.210
I know this may not sound very PC,
but I want romance.

07:44.377 --> 07:48.214
Long, slow kisses,
late-night talks, candlelight.

07:48.381 --> 07:52.176
I love love. I'd take what
Prue has in a flat second.

07:52.343 --> 07:56.222
Then you'd have to deal with the family
secret, which isn't exactly normal, is it?

08:05.231 --> 08:06.691
Did you see the coroner's report?

08:07.900 --> 08:11.237
Skye Russell died of massive
internal haemorrhaging.

08:11.404 --> 08:13.572
Her body literally imploded upon itself.

08:13.739 --> 08:15.825
Ever seen anything like it before?

08:16.409 --> 08:19.996
On jumpers, but the bodies
were usually found on sidewalks.

08:21.414 --> 08:24.959
There aren't signs of external damage
consistent with any type of fall.

08:25.626 --> 08:28.879
- In fact, there's not a scratch on her.
- Yeah, well, maybe we were wrong.

08:29.046 --> 08:31.799
- Maybe her body was moved.
- From where? How?

08:33.008 --> 08:35.719
The front door was locked and bolted,
each window had bars on it,

08:35.885 --> 08:37.888
none of which had been
tampered with in any way.

08:38.054 --> 08:41.308
Nobody but she was in
that apartment last night.

08:43.434 --> 08:45.229
It's not a suicide, Morris.

08:45.396 --> 08:49.441
And it's sure not death by natural
causes, which leaves only one thing.

08:49.608 --> 08:52.903
- Murder.
- I hate it when we say that.

09:02.204 --> 09:03.539
Here you go, Mr Manford.

09:03.705 --> 09:06.083
Chicken with rice and vegetables,
just the way you like it.

09:06.250 --> 09:09.920
Chicken well-done, light oil on
the vegetables, and rice steamed dry.

09:10.087 --> 09:11.421
Thanks.

09:11.588 --> 09:13.423
<i>Bon app√©tit.</i>

09:14.675 --> 09:16.885
Hey, why are you doing that?

09:17.261 --> 09:19.846
Skye didn't show up for her shift today,
so we're short-handed.

09:24.518 --> 09:26.395
So, what's up?

09:26.561 --> 09:29.898
I found this spell:

09:30.065 --> 09:31.900
How to attract a lover.

09:32.109 --> 09:34.695
No, Phoebe, forget it.
We're not casting any spells.

09:35.112 --> 09:38.115
Come on. There must be more
to our powers than warlock wasting.

09:38.281 --> 09:40.283
I'm ready to have some fun
with our magic.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.285
No. No personal gain, remember?

09:42.577 --> 09:44.704
How is it personal gain
if we're using our powers

09:44.871 --> 09:47.290
to bring happiness
to another person?

09:47.457 --> 09:51.002
And in my case,
lots and lots of happiness.

09:51.211 --> 09:53.129
- Could you pass me that colander?
- Yeah.

09:53.296 --> 09:55.382
Look, I'm not talking
about marriage here.

09:55.549 --> 09:57.676
We have our 30s
to freak out about that.

09:57.842 --> 09:59.386
This...

09:59.553 --> 10:02.347
This spell is about
having a good time.

10:03.223 --> 10:07.310
I admit, it's tempting. The dating
scene can be a little frustrating.

10:07.477 --> 10:10.605
But bringing a man into our life
through a spell?

10:10.772 --> 10:13.358
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but isn't that a little bit desperate?

10:13.525 --> 10:15.985
No, how is asking for what
you want being desperate?

10:16.152 --> 10:17.987
I say it's not. I say it's empowering.

10:19.739 --> 10:23.368
<i>Besides, the Book of Shadows says
we could reverse the spell at any time.</i>

10:31.584 --> 10:33.545
Piper! Phoebe!

10:33.711 --> 10:37.507
Prue, you're home.
I thought you had a date with Andy.

10:37.674 --> 10:39.634
No, he had to cancel.
What are you doing?

10:40.260 --> 10:41.594
Piper, I was wrong.

10:41.803 --> 10:44.931
The spell calls for cayenne pepper,
not black pepper.

10:47.392 --> 10:49.394
Did I say spell?

10:50.645 --> 10:52.397
I meant recipe.

10:53.564 --> 10:55.525
We are so busted, aren't we?

10:55.691 --> 10:58.402
I would say yes.
What spell are you casting?

10:59.070 --> 11:01.572
I realised today that Phoebe may
have stumbled onto something.

11:01.739 --> 11:03.282
Something that actually makes sense.

11:03.866 --> 11:05.535
Now I'm worried.

11:06.077 --> 11:08.162
All the spells are in this book
for a reason, right?

11:08.329 --> 11:11.582
I think this spell could be a harmless
opportunity for us to test our powers.

11:11.749 --> 11:13.251
You know, really get
a handle on them.

11:13.417 --> 11:16.087
I mean, why else would it say
we can reverse it at any time?

11:16.254 --> 11:18.214
All I want is someone
special in my life.

11:18.381 --> 11:21.550
And this spell provides that exactly.

11:21.884 --> 11:24.095
I can translate.

11:24.261 --> 11:27.056
- You've got to be kidding.
- We were hoping you would join us.

11:27.932 --> 11:31.185
No, I've got enough complications
in my life. You two are on your own.

11:31.685 --> 11:33.229
You know where to find us.

11:33.813 --> 11:36.273
Be careful what you wish for.

11:39.193 --> 11:41.487
- Okay, you wanna go first?
- No. You go first.

11:41.654 --> 11:43.072
Okay.

11:43.239 --> 11:45.157
Hey, that's not fair.

11:45.699 --> 11:50.329
You want a man who is single,
smart, endowed.

11:50.537 --> 11:53.791
- Employed.
- Oh, sorry, "employed."

11:53.958 --> 11:58.629
"A man who loves sleeping in
on Sundays, sunset bike rides,

11:59.546 --> 12:02.758
cuddling by a roaring fire

12:02.966 --> 12:04.510
and late-night talks.

12:04.677 --> 12:09.223
A man who loves love
as much as you do."

12:10.224 --> 12:12.684
- Wow, you're a romantic.
- Yep.

12:12.851 --> 12:14.561
Your turn.

12:15.062 --> 12:17.314
You want the sexy silent type

12:17.481 --> 12:20.359
that finds you driving through town
on the back of a Harley

12:20.567 --> 12:21.902
at 3:00 in the morning.

12:22.069 --> 12:26.782
"A man who appreciates scented
candles, body oils and Italian sheets."

12:28.158 --> 12:31.536
"He's about hunger
and lust and danger.

12:31.745 --> 12:34.122
And even though you know all this,
even though you know

12:34.289 --> 12:38.085
he'll never meet your friends or share
a holiday meal with your family,

12:38.251 --> 12:42.464
you still can't stay away."

12:42.756 --> 12:44.883
- And he recycles.
- He recycles?

12:45.133 --> 12:48.970
Yeah. And I think it goes without
saying that we both want a man

12:49.137 --> 12:52.599
who is well... employed.

12:52.766 --> 12:54.643
You're seriously twisted.

12:56.394 --> 12:59.314
- This is the spell we have to say?
- Yeah.

12:59.481 --> 13:01.816
We're lucky. If we were men
looking for women,

13:01.983 --> 13:04.236
the spell requires
putting a piece of honey cake

13:04.402 --> 13:06.613
in a sweaty armpit for days.

13:07.530 --> 13:10.533
- Okay. I think we can say this.
- Okay.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.662
<i>- I conjure thee. I conjure thee.
- I conjure thee. I conjure thee.</i>

13:13.828 --> 13:16.373
<i>- I'm the queen, you're the bee.
- I'm the queen, you're the bee.</i>

13:16.623 --> 13:19.667
<i>- As I desire, so shall it be.
- As I desire, so shall it be.</i>

13:20.710 --> 13:23.421
<i>- I conjure thee. I conjure thee.
- I conjure thee. I conjure thee.</i>

13:23.588 --> 13:25.757
<i>- I'm the queen, you're the bee.
- I'm the queen, you're the bee.</i>

13:25.965 --> 13:28.718
<i>- As I desire, so shall it be.
- As I desire, so shall it be.</i>

13:34.057 --> 13:36.017
- Do you think it worked?
- I don't know.

13:36.184 --> 13:38.353
The big spells usually require
all three of us.

13:44.651 --> 13:46.527
Is it for me? Is it for me?

13:46.694 --> 13:50.198
Who's this?
I'm sorry, do I know you?

13:50.990 --> 13:53.201
Yeah, we met at Quake.

13:53.368 --> 13:55.370
Well, we didn't actually meet.

13:55.536 --> 14:01.042
I sent you a glass of chardonnay,
and you sent it back.

14:01.209 --> 14:04.796
Still, you know, I was wondering,

14:04.962 --> 14:07.215
maybe you'd like to
go out sometime?

14:08.049 --> 14:10.468
Look, as I told the waitress,
I'm just not available.

14:10.718 --> 14:13.554
<i>How did you get my number,
my name?</i>

14:14.388 --> 14:15.973
Hello?

14:17.141 --> 14:18.476
Who is it?

14:18.643 --> 14:20.603
That guy from Quake
who sent me a drink.

14:20.770 --> 14:24.315
- What did he want?
- He asked me out.

14:25.316 --> 14:27.401
Hello. Missy May,
where are you going?

14:27.610 --> 14:31.405
I'm going to Quake to see if my
spell worked. Wanna join me?

14:31.656 --> 14:33.240
- Pass.
- No, thanks.

14:33.532 --> 14:35.701
I'm gonna take a bath.

15:19.995 --> 15:21.872
Hello, Prue.

15:22.915 --> 15:26.418
- Who...?
- Who am I and how did I get in?

15:26.835 --> 15:29.463
- I don't care, just get...
- Out of the bathroom?

15:30.005 --> 15:31.465
- Piper, help!
- Piper, help!

15:32.507 --> 15:36.261
Scream all you want.
No one can help you.

15:36.845 --> 15:38.889
- How did you...?
- Know what you're thinking?

15:39.097 --> 15:41.683
- Know what you're going to say?
- Yes.

15:45.020 --> 15:47.773
I am in your unconscious.

15:47.939 --> 15:51.151
I know your every thought
and desire.

15:51.693 --> 15:53.278
Who are you?

15:55.363 --> 15:58.033
I'm the man of your dreams.

16:01.578 --> 16:03.497
You are not real. You don't exist.

16:03.705 --> 16:06.666
That's what your mother
used to say, isn't it?

16:06.833 --> 16:10.378
Every night
before you went to sleep?

16:11.212 --> 16:14.716
- You are not real. You don't exist.
- As she tucked you in,

16:14.883 --> 16:16.926
- she'd say...
- You are not real. You don't exist.

16:17.093 --> 16:20.680
...if you saw any monsters...
- You are not real. You don't exist.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.600
...to tell yourself they weren't real.

16:25.101 --> 16:28.480
- You are not real. You don't exist.
- They...

16:28.646 --> 16:30.482
...didn't exist.

16:33.109 --> 16:35.653
I can't move. Why can't I move?

16:36.529 --> 16:40.158
Because I'm going
to love you to death.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.264
Prue? Are you okay?

17:04.766 --> 17:07.018
- Yeah.
- You were yelling.

17:08.352 --> 17:10.313
Yeah, I had a...

17:10.480 --> 17:14.275
- I had a really bad thing.
- A thing?

17:15.526 --> 17:17.403
Yeah.

17:18.195 --> 17:20.114
I'm okay now.

17:20.281 --> 17:23.242
I promise. Just go back to bed.

17:38.174 --> 17:40.051
Oh, my God.

17:50.186 --> 17:53.439
Do you remember what Mom
used to say about nightmares?

17:53.606 --> 17:58.277
She said if we saw any monsters to tell
them to go away, that they didn't exist.

17:58.444 --> 17:59.778
Always worked too.

18:00.237 --> 18:01.989
Yeah, well, not this time.

18:03.073 --> 18:05.284
He knew about Mom.

18:05.451 --> 18:08.954
He knew what she told us,
and how did he know that?

18:09.705 --> 18:12.249
And what about the marks
on my back?

18:13.250 --> 18:15.794
Piper, they were there
and now they've disappeared.

18:15.961 --> 18:19.089
I don't know how and I don't know why,
but they were definitely there.

18:19.339 --> 18:22.760
How many hours did you work
this week? Sixty, 70?

18:22.926 --> 18:25.971
And what are you doing today,
on a Saturday no less?

18:26.138 --> 18:30.476
The auction starts on Monday, and
the shipment arrived three days late.

18:31.185 --> 18:34.855
And you're changing the subject.
You don't believe me.

18:35.272 --> 18:38.609
No, I believe you think
you saw marks on your back.

18:39.067 --> 18:41.403
But I'm watching you down
your third cup of coffee,

18:41.570 --> 18:45.198
and we're talking about a nightmare
you had while asleep in the tub.

18:45.365 --> 18:47.993
So isn't it possible that exhaustion
made you see those marks

18:48.160 --> 18:50.579
and not some dream guy?

18:50.746 --> 18:53.040
No. He was in my dream.
It was real.

18:54.291 --> 18:56.334
So why didn't you use
your power to help you out?

18:56.543 --> 18:58.670
- You know, move him away.
- I don't know.

18:58.879 --> 19:00.213
Morning.

19:03.091 --> 19:04.885
What...?

19:06.595 --> 19:08.471
Excuse me, but who are you?

19:09.806 --> 19:11.558
- Who cares?
- Hans,

19:11.725 --> 19:14.978
I found your T-shirt.

19:16.229 --> 19:17.731
Was it in the hammock or...?

19:18.231 --> 19:20.025
- It doesn't matter.
- Thanks.

19:20.233 --> 19:21.651
Sure.

19:21.818 --> 19:23.486
<i>Hammock?</i>

19:24.112 --> 19:25.655
- Well, I gotta run.
- Okay.

19:25.822 --> 19:27.991
I'll meet you later for lunch.

19:28.158 --> 19:30.660
- Okay.
- I almost forgot.

19:44.007 --> 19:46.801
Don't worry. We had safe sex.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.469
A lot of safe sex.

19:56.978 --> 20:00.023
- It's all here in their FBI files.
- Why do you do this to me?

20:00.189 --> 20:01.774
Three young women,
completely unrelated

20:01.983 --> 20:04.652
except for the fact they died
the exact same way as the waitress.

20:04.819 --> 20:09.240
Medical examiner listed them
all as jumpers. Case closed.

20:09.449 --> 20:11.534
Look at the crime photos.

20:11.701 --> 20:14.954
All the vics were found
locked in their rooms.

20:16.539 --> 20:19.667
We got the M.O.
Of a serial killer here, Morris.

20:23.171 --> 20:25.590
I'm telling you, Piper,
the spell worked.

20:25.756 --> 20:27.925
A little louder, Pheebs,
I don't think Oakland heard.

20:28.092 --> 20:31.470
Well, it did. Get this.
Hans doesn't go to bars.

20:31.637 --> 20:33.598
He's never been to Quake.
But last night,

20:33.764 --> 20:37.643
he's on his way back
from his acting class when, bam!

20:37.810 --> 20:41.981
Flat tire on his motorcycle,
right across the street from Quake.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.108
So he comes in
to use the payphone,

20:44.275 --> 20:49.530
and who should he bump into but me,
exiting the ladies' room.

20:49.697 --> 20:51.949
Phoebe, you threw his clothes
all over the house.

20:52.116 --> 20:54.243
That's not a spell working,
that's hormones.

20:54.410 --> 20:56.871
No, it's not like that.

20:57.121 --> 21:00.416
I really like Hans. He's really cool.

21:00.875 --> 21:03.210
And he likes me too.

21:16.015 --> 21:19.143
Mr Manford, here you go. Chicken,
rice, veggies, just the way you like it.

21:19.309 --> 21:21.770
Thank you, and please call me Jack.

21:24.815 --> 21:27.985
Has anybody ever told you
how truly beautiful you are?

21:29.236 --> 21:30.988
Have you been drinking?

21:31.780 --> 21:34.366
A sense of humour. I love that.

21:35.784 --> 21:37.494
Wait, Piper, don't go.

21:37.703 --> 21:39.496
I don't know why,

21:39.663 --> 21:42.583
but I've gotta get to know you.
Have dinner with me.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.127
Can you hang on a second?

21:58.724 --> 22:01.143
Prue Halliwell, please.
It's her sister Piper.

22:01.309 --> 22:04.062
You know you shouldn't have
dinner with that guy.

22:04.813 --> 22:06.440
Why not?

22:06.606 --> 22:10.318
Because you should
fly to Paris with me.

22:11.653 --> 22:14.072
Tell her it's an emergency.

22:17.033 --> 22:21.288
So you're not actually thinking of going
out with this Jack guy, are you?

22:21.454 --> 22:23.540
Have you finished
the Cromwell miniatures yet?

22:23.707 --> 22:25.834
Rex. Hang on a second.

22:26.001 --> 22:28.086
No, I'm still cataloguing
the Rembrandt sketches.

22:28.253 --> 22:30.588
Oh, well, set them aside.

22:30.755 --> 22:34.342
The letters of Ernest Hemingway
are now first on the block.

22:35.135 --> 22:36.761
Thanks, boys.

22:37.929 --> 22:40.181
I don't believe it,
I'm gonna be here all night.

22:40.348 --> 22:42.475
Piper, let me call you back.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.233
Jack stayed through the entire
lunch shift, talked my ear off,

22:50.400 --> 22:52.485
had me laughing at all his stories

22:52.652 --> 22:56.155
and somehow convinced me
to have coffee with him.

22:56.322 --> 22:59.534
Hans and I are going dancing at Rave.
You and Jack should come join us.

22:59.701 --> 23:02.078
Well, if our dinner date lasts
as long as our coffee break,

23:02.245 --> 23:04.330
we wouldn't make it there till closing.

23:04.497 --> 23:07.458
Maybe we could all meet
back at the house later.

23:09.711 --> 23:11.546
This has worked out
so great, hasn't it?

23:11.754 --> 23:13.214
Yeah.

23:17.260 --> 23:19.011
Great.

23:20.721 --> 23:24.183
So this is a dream lab?
They actually pay people to sleep?

23:24.350 --> 23:27.145
If you wait here, I'll tell Mr Berman
you'd like to speak with him.

23:27.311 --> 23:29.272
Thank you.

23:31.399 --> 23:34.443
Look, just because Berman
dated the first victim...

23:34.610 --> 23:36.904
- Julie Derikson?
...doesn't make him a killer.

23:37.071 --> 23:40.032
Yeah, but it's a great place to start.

23:40.616 --> 23:43.411
Hell, it's our only place to start.

23:43.577 --> 23:45.246
What do you know
about this place anyway?

23:45.413 --> 23:47.999
It's a privately funded
research facility.

23:48.165 --> 23:50.960
And Julie Derikson worked here too.

23:51.127 --> 23:55.297
She and Berman were teamed
together on some experimental project.

23:56.507 --> 23:58.926
Hello, inspectors.

23:59.677 --> 24:01.178
How may I help you?

24:11.063 --> 24:12.731
You Whitaker Berman?

24:12.898 --> 24:16.318
Yes. What's this about?

24:16.860 --> 24:19.863
We're conducting an investigation.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

24:20.030 --> 24:21.824
Oh. Regarding?

24:23.701 --> 24:25.661
You know this woman?

24:30.582 --> 24:34.211
That's Julie Derikson.
She was my girlfriend.

24:35.045 --> 24:39.091
I was heartbroken when she...

24:39.967 --> 24:42.719
Forgive me,

24:42.886 --> 24:45.722
it's just very hard. I...

24:46.348 --> 24:48.016
I still miss her.

24:48.892 --> 24:51.520
Another woman died
just like her the other night.

24:51.728 --> 24:53.855
A waitress, crushed
to death in her sleep.

24:54.022 --> 24:56.066
Oh, you're kidding.

24:56.358 --> 24:57.734
No.

24:57.901 --> 25:00.320
That's... That's awful.

25:01.363 --> 25:03.990
Could you tell us your whereabouts
the night before last?

25:04.658 --> 25:08.662
I was here in the lab, asleep.

25:09.454 --> 25:11.164
I left in the morning.

25:11.373 --> 25:13.583
Any witnesses
who can confirm that?

25:13.750 --> 25:18.463
A night's worth of data,
two scientists and a lab technician.

25:18.630 --> 25:20.674
Shall I have them paged?

25:20.882 --> 25:24.761
No, that's okay, Mr Berman.
We're sorry we disturbed you.

25:24.928 --> 25:26.721
Thank you for your time.

25:39.025 --> 25:41.403
What else can I tell you?

25:41.569 --> 25:45.156
When I get stressed,
I get hives in very strange places.

25:45.323 --> 25:48.827
Which is nothing compared to what
happens when I panic, believe me.

25:48.993 --> 25:51.287
Your honesty is so refreshing.

25:52.122 --> 25:54.582
Well, it helps keep
my ulcer under control.

25:54.916 --> 25:59.003
It's the '90s. Is there anyone
who doesn't have one?

25:59.170 --> 26:02.382
- Would you like to see my tattoo?
- Would you like to see mine?

26:03.591 --> 26:05.301
Is there nothing I can say
to turn you off?

26:05.635 --> 26:07.220
There really isn't.

26:07.428 --> 26:09.305
Which is kind of strange, actually.

26:09.472 --> 26:11.182
Not really.

26:11.349 --> 26:14.727
Jack, you're under a...

26:19.691 --> 26:21.234
Spell.

26:31.661 --> 26:33.287
Hey there.

26:48.594 --> 26:51.222
Give me 30 cc's of Androvin.

26:51.389 --> 26:53.432
Thirty cc's? That's twice...

26:53.599 --> 26:56.811
I'll be in REM sleep
quicker and longer.

26:56.977 --> 26:59.730
Set the dream-inducement system
to level 12.

26:59.897 --> 27:02.983
You haven't got the results back
from level eight.

27:03.776 --> 27:07.404
This is my grant, my experiment.

27:07.571 --> 27:11.534
Set the machine
and give me the shot.

27:25.005 --> 27:29.385
Hello, Prue. We meet again.

27:29.551 --> 27:34.390
All that work, all those hours,
you fell asleep at your desk.

27:35.599 --> 27:38.018
- Someone help!
- What do you hide from at work?

27:38.310 --> 27:40.562
Is it the pain of your past

27:40.729 --> 27:44.525
or the uncertainty of your future?

27:45.400 --> 27:46.902
I don't hide from anything.

27:47.069 --> 27:49.530
You can't move
out of the chair, can you?

27:50.822 --> 27:52.616
Don't you wonder why?

27:53.659 --> 27:57.079
Because I don't want you to.
You're powerless, Prue.

27:57.287 --> 28:00.249
- Go to hell.
- I, on the other hand, am all-powerful.

28:00.749 --> 28:03.210
You don't wanna talk to me?
That's fine.

28:04.086 --> 28:05.545
There's always Piper, Phoebe

28:05.712 --> 28:08.465
or any number of young,
single women out there.

28:08.632 --> 28:10.967
It's an endless pool
for the Dream Sorcerer.

28:11.134 --> 28:12.511
No, wait, I'll stay.

28:12.719 --> 28:14.763
It's too late. You're falling asleep.

28:14.930 --> 28:16.431
No, I'm fine. I'm awake.

28:17.015 --> 28:19.101
Shall I sing you a lullaby?

28:19.309 --> 28:20.936
I don't think so.

28:24.940 --> 28:26.733
- No!
- Good night, Prue.

28:35.575 --> 28:37.786
- Hello.
- Hi, you're still at the office.

28:39.579 --> 28:42.415
Yeah, can I call you back?

28:42.916 --> 28:45.418
Sure. I'm at the station house.

28:45.627 --> 28:48.755
<i>- Everything okay?
- It is now.</i>

28:49.714 --> 28:51.966
Thanks, Andy.
Thanks for calling.

28:53.009 --> 28:54.469
I just wanted to hear your voice.

28:55.428 --> 28:57.097
Okay, bye.

28:58.807 --> 29:01.434
Prue? Bloody hell.

29:17.867 --> 29:20.244
The man is in a wheelchair.

29:20.411 --> 29:23.539
He's got no motive,
and he's got an alibi.

29:23.706 --> 29:27.585
So tell me again why you think
Berman is our suspect.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.588
- Dream leaping.
- Dream leaping?

29:31.047 --> 29:33.966
That's what Berman's researching
at the lab, dream leaping.

29:34.133 --> 29:36.719
The ability to project himself
into someone else's dreams.

29:36.886 --> 29:40.223
Into women's dreams
and killing them?

29:40.640 --> 29:42.058
Now who's dreaming?

29:43.601 --> 29:46.020
Not just any women.
Women who reject him.

29:46.229 --> 29:48.022
Just like Julie Derikson did.

29:48.231 --> 29:50.566
She broke up with him
while they were driving somewhere.

29:50.733 --> 29:54.278
They got into an accident.
That's why he's paralysed.

29:56.197 --> 29:58.532
It's all there in the police report.

29:58.699 --> 30:00.576
The day after he went
back to work at the lab,

30:00.743 --> 30:02.453
Julie Derikson died suspiciously.

30:03.204 --> 30:08.042
Six months later, two more women
died in their sleep, crushed to death.

30:08.417 --> 30:10.669
Coincidence? You tell me.

30:11.796 --> 30:14.465
Love to. Can't.

30:14.673 --> 30:16.258
Let's go.

30:22.056 --> 30:24.266
I'm home.

30:39.073 --> 30:41.450
- You're home early.
- Yeah, so are you.

30:41.617 --> 30:44.411
What's with all the flowers?
You and Jack fighting already?

30:44.620 --> 30:48.916
I wish. The flowers were all waiting
on the doorstep when I returned.

30:49.082 --> 30:52.503
They're from men I barely know
and men I've never met.

30:52.753 --> 30:54.713
All the flowers in here are for you.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.508
Oh, well,

30:57.674 --> 31:00.177
- I know they're not from Hans.
- What happened?

31:00.385 --> 31:04.306
He wouldn't leave me alone all night.
He kept touching me.

31:04.514 --> 31:06.850
And practically every guy
in the bar was hitting on me.

31:07.017 --> 31:11.855
Finally, I couldn't take it anymore.
I ditched Hans and left him at the club.

31:12.022 --> 31:13.690
So how was your date?

31:13.857 --> 31:18.445
Perfect. Everything was perfect.
Even my faults were perfect.

31:18.737 --> 31:20.113
And this is a bad thing?

31:21.531 --> 31:24.701
It wasn't real. Everything he said,
everything he felt,

31:24.868 --> 31:27.662
it was because of the spell.
Not because of me.

31:27.871 --> 31:30.790
Piper, you don't know that.
Maybe he meant every word.

31:30.957 --> 31:34.252
Maybe if it wasn't for the spell,
he would've never had the chance

31:34.419 --> 31:36.504
to feel those things,
let alone say them.

31:36.671 --> 31:38.131
No, Phoebe,

31:38.298 --> 31:41.176
Iove is a magic between two
people that cannot be explained

31:41.343 --> 31:43.595
and cannot be conjured.

31:43.762 --> 31:46.473
What we did, it's just... It's not right.

31:47.849 --> 31:50.977
Even our poor cat's in hell.

31:51.519 --> 31:54.356
Go away, horny tomcats.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.359
Let's reverse the spell.

32:04.699 --> 32:06.367
Hello?

32:06.534 --> 32:09.204
- Prue, where are you?
- I'm still at the office.

32:09.370 --> 32:12.540
Look, I fell asleep and that man from
my dream, he tried to kill me again.

32:12.707 --> 32:14.834
- What?
- Yeah, I don't understand why.

32:15.001 --> 32:18.254
All I know is, I'm only safe if I stay
awake. If I fall asleep, I'm dead.

32:18.421 --> 32:20.381
Stay where you are.
We'll come pick you up.

32:20.590 --> 32:22.884
No, I don't wanna stay here
another minute.

32:23.051 --> 32:26.054
<i>Look in the Book of Shadows and see
if you can find anything on this guy.</i>

32:26.220 --> 32:29.057
He calls himself
a Dream Sorcerer, okay?

32:33.436 --> 32:34.812
- Nothing?
- Nada.

32:34.979 --> 32:36.105
There's gotta be something.

32:36.272 --> 32:39.233
I'm telling you, there's no
Dream Sorcerer stuff anywhere.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.028
<i>That's impossible. The Book
of Shadows has never let us down.</i>

32:42.195 --> 32:44.780
Maybe he's not a demon.
Maybe he's a mortal.

32:44.947 --> 32:47.950
- Then he's got one hell of a power.
- You're not kidding.

32:48.117 --> 32:52.079
Demon, mortal. There's gotta
be some way to stop him.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.624
That's gotta be Prue.

32:54.790 --> 32:56.709
Wait. What are we gonna tell her?

32:56.876 --> 33:00.004
That we can't help her?
That she can never go to sleep?

33:05.718 --> 33:07.553
Come on, answer the phone.

33:10.431 --> 33:12.725
- Hello?
- Hey, did you find anything?

33:12.933 --> 33:16.562
No. But don't worry, you're not in this
alone. Phoebe and I will help you.

33:16.771 --> 33:18.606
We don't even know what he is.

33:19.190 --> 33:21.901
The most important thing right now
is for you to get home safely.

33:22.109 --> 33:26.322
Okay, look, just keep talking.
Don't let me fall asleep.

33:26.530 --> 33:27.907
She sounds exhausted.

33:28.073 --> 33:32.620
Okay, blast the air conditioning, crank
the stereo and roll down the windows.

33:32.786 --> 33:36.081
Don't crank the stereo. What's that
song we'd sing when we were little?

33:36.290 --> 33:38.500
- The road-trip song?
- Yeah. Did you hear that, Prue?

33:38.959 --> 33:40.586
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, don't worry.

33:40.753 --> 33:44.089
Everything's gonna be fine.
Nothing is gonna happen.

33:44.298 --> 33:46.675
- Phoebe!
- What the...? Hans?

33:46.884 --> 33:48.927
Let me in, I have to see you!

33:49.094 --> 33:50.429
Go away.

33:52.139 --> 33:54.600
<i>- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- Piper? Phoebe?</i>

33:55.767 --> 33:58.896
You left me.
How could you leave me?

33:59.313 --> 34:00.981
- Hans, please.
- Ever since I met you,

34:01.148 --> 34:03.817
I can't do anything. Eat, drink, sleep!

34:03.984 --> 34:05.819
All I can do is think about you!

34:06.361 --> 34:08.030
Piper.

34:09.114 --> 34:10.489
Phoebe.

34:10.741 --> 34:12.826
The time is now, Prue.

34:13.159 --> 34:14.703
We're almost there.

34:16.996 --> 34:18.498
Piper, Phoebe, where are you?

34:18.706 --> 34:20.667
What have you done to me?

34:25.005 --> 34:27.382
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

34:27.549 --> 34:29.176
Prue.

34:36.308 --> 34:39.018
Prue. Prue!

34:39.393 --> 34:41.353
She's not there.

34:41.897 --> 34:44.274
Say good night, Prue.

34:49.779 --> 34:51.947
<i>- The mobile unit you are...
- She's not answering.</i>

35:09.299 --> 35:11.718
I can't fall asleep.

35:14.470 --> 35:16.639
Can't fall asleep.

35:22.020 --> 35:23.396
Watch the line.

35:23.563 --> 35:25.940
- What's open?
- Trauma 1.

35:26.107 --> 35:28.109
- What do you got?
- I got a 27-year-old female.

35:28.276 --> 35:31.904
One-on-one, car versus utility pole.
BP, 80/40. Pulse, 110.

35:32.071 --> 35:34.365
Semiconscious at the scene.

35:35.616 --> 35:38.161
Pupils are responsive.
Miss Halliwell, hang in there.

35:38.327 --> 35:40.204
Must stay awake.

35:40.371 --> 35:42.582
Must stay awake.

35:43.583 --> 35:47.503
Where's X-ray? I want a C-spine now.
And have CT prep for us.

35:49.881 --> 35:52.758
- Do you want a CBC and an MLP?
- Yes.

35:55.344 --> 35:57.305
Ready. One, two, three.

36:03.769 --> 36:07.315
- Resps down to 35. Pulse ox is falling.
- That can't be.

36:07.773 --> 36:10.109
Give me 500 mics of dopamine
and get ready to intubate.

36:10.651 --> 36:12.903
Stay with us, Miss Halliwell.

36:13.070 --> 36:14.530
Damn, she's unconscious.

36:17.158 --> 36:20.161
- How did I get here? I'm not...
- Asleep?

36:20.786 --> 36:24.790
Actually, you're unconscious.
You fell asleep at the wheel,

36:24.999 --> 36:29.211
hit a pole. Terrible, terrible thing.

36:30.004 --> 36:35.301
Speaking of pain,
you really hurt me last night.

36:35.843 --> 36:37.845
And not just my feelings.

36:38.137 --> 36:39.930
Suffer.

36:40.931 --> 36:44.768
We're definitely out of range.

36:46.353 --> 36:49.440
Want a little wine with your death?

36:56.071 --> 36:58.949
Mr Berman insists that he's not
to be disturbed during his experiment.

36:59.116 --> 37:01.869
I don't care. We wanna talk to him.
Just wake him up.

37:02.035 --> 37:04.163
It's not gonna be easy.
He's heavily sedated.

37:04.329 --> 37:06.290
Just get to work.

37:07.166 --> 37:09.167
- I hope you're right about this.
- I know I am.

37:09.334 --> 37:14.172
The question now isn't if Berman's
gonna kill again, but who?

37:21.680 --> 37:24.558
- Do you like the dress?
- I've worn better.

37:26.101 --> 37:27.811
Yeah.

37:44.369 --> 37:47.163
Excuse me.
You called us a little while ago.

37:47.330 --> 37:49.624
Our sister is here, Prue Halliwell.

37:53.295 --> 37:55.714
- Your sister's still in Trauma 1.
- Is she okay?

37:55.880 --> 37:58.133
Go to the waiting room,
a doctor will be right with you.

37:58.300 --> 38:00.593
Okay, thank you.

38:07.308 --> 38:10.895
Mr Berman! Mr Berman, wake up!

38:11.062 --> 38:14.899
I don't care what it takes.
You wake him up. Now!

38:19.404 --> 38:21.489
Berman, wake up!

38:22.282 --> 38:24.284
Come on, Berman!

38:27.287 --> 38:29.122
<i>Wake up, Berman!</i>

38:29.289 --> 38:30.957
Andy.

38:34.210 --> 38:37.171
We're here, Prue, right beside you.

38:37.338 --> 38:38.673
Can you hear us?

38:40.675 --> 38:42.176
<i>Prue?</i>

38:42.760 --> 38:45.304
Piper? Phoebe?

38:45.471 --> 38:47.974
<i>- Prue?
- They can't help you.</i>

38:48.141 --> 38:50.685
You're mine now.

38:58.109 --> 39:00.027
I'm scared.

39:00.695 --> 39:02.822
I know. Me too.

39:03.906 --> 39:05.616
What do we do?

39:06.075 --> 39:08.452
We don't let her give up.

39:08.953 --> 39:13.124
Prue, listen to me.
You have got to fight this guy.

39:13.374 --> 39:15.918
- Don't leave us.
- You can do it.

39:16.127 --> 39:18.921
- We need you.
- Use your power, Prue.

39:19.547 --> 39:20.881
Come back to us.

39:23.092 --> 39:25.970
<i>- Use your power, Prue.
- You can do it, Prue.</i>

39:26.137 --> 39:28.347
Where are you?

39:28.514 --> 39:30.349
You're powerless.

39:30.766 --> 39:33.435
<i>- Prue, you can do it.
- You're stronger.</i>

39:33.602 --> 39:35.646
<i>Use your power against him.</i>

39:35.813 --> 39:39.024
<i>- Use your power, Prue.
- Don't leave us.</i>

39:39.191 --> 39:40.734
<i>Prue.</i>

39:43.821 --> 39:45.990
<i>- You can do it.
- Use your power.</i>

39:47.574 --> 39:50.619
<i>- Prue.
- Shall I say good night?</i>

39:55.332 --> 39:57.084
No, let me.

39:57.710 --> 39:59.461
Good night.

40:12.599 --> 40:14.309
I don't believe it.

40:14.476 --> 40:17.521
- He's dead.
- I'll never doubt you again.

40:22.109 --> 40:23.610
Prue?

40:24.987 --> 40:26.780
Are you okay?

40:27.739 --> 40:29.616
Yeah, I'm okay.

40:31.702 --> 40:33.078
What about the...?

40:34.413 --> 40:36.164
He's gone.

40:56.560 --> 40:57.894
Knock, knock.

40:58.061 --> 41:00.689
- Tell me you're here to pick me up.
- Hi.

41:00.897 --> 41:03.525
No, Dr Black said
one more day just to be sure.

41:03.692 --> 41:06.194
Yeah, and you know, it wouldn't
kill you to get some rest.

41:08.238 --> 41:10.323
Phoebe, it's okay.
Thanks for the flowers.

41:10.907 --> 41:12.450
Yeah.

41:13.243 --> 41:15.161
What's going on?

41:15.370 --> 41:16.704
Long story, not very interesting.

41:16.996 --> 41:19.791
Does this have anything
to do with your lust spell?

41:20.834 --> 41:23.545
- But don't worry.
- We reversed the spell last night.

41:23.711 --> 41:26.172
- Piper called Jack.
- The guy that you had dinner with?

41:26.506 --> 41:28.466
And he didn't remember anything.

41:28.633 --> 41:32.554
- And Phoebe called Hans.
- And he didn't remember anything.

41:32.720 --> 41:35.056
So don't worry,
everything is back to normal.

41:35.390 --> 41:37.141
- Good.
- Afternoon, ladies.

41:37.934 --> 41:39.269
Surprise.

41:40.270 --> 41:41.938
Yes, it is.

41:42.105 --> 41:44.565
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't tell him.

41:44.774 --> 41:46.651
Guilty. Come on, let's go.

41:46.859 --> 41:48.152
Okay. Bye.

41:49.070 --> 41:52.281
- We'll see you later tonight?
- After we raid your closet.

41:53.658 --> 41:55.451
Brought your favourite.

41:56.452 --> 41:58.162
Oh, cheeseburgers and fries.

41:59.747 --> 42:01.749
Glad to see every bone
in your body's not broken.

42:02.375 --> 42:04.210
- What?
- The car accident.

42:04.460 --> 42:06.212
Never mind.

42:07.421 --> 42:09.090
Thank you.
