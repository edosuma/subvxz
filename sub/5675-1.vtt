02:23.800 --> 02:26.837
Robbed! Cleaned out!

02:27.000 --> 02:29.878
Nine thousand nine hundred
and sixty-seven dollars.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.439
Precisely as I told you
over the telephone.

02:32.040 --> 02:35.157
And that girl did it. Marion Holland!

02:35.320 --> 02:37.470
That's the girl. Marion Holland!

02:37.640 --> 02:41.792
- Can you describe her, Mr Strutt?
- Certainly I can.

02:41.960 --> 02:45.589
Five feet five.
A hundred and ten pounds.

02:46.680 --> 02:47.999
Size eight dress.

02:48.880 --> 02:53.192
Blue eyes. Black, wavy hair.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.998
Even features. Good teeth.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.151
- (Chuckling)
- What's so damn funny?

02:59.320 --> 03:01.834
There 's been a grand larceny
committed on these premises!

03:02.000 --> 03:05.310
Yes, sir. You were saying,
ah, black hair,

03:05.480 --> 03:08.790
wavy, even features, good teeth.

03:08.960 --> 03:11.554
- She was in your employ 4 months?
- Mmm.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.550
What were her references, sir?

03:14.720 --> 03:18.554
Well, as a matter of fact -

03:18.720 --> 03:21.280
Yes, uh,
she had references, I 'm sure.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.874
Oh, Mr Strutt, don't you remember?

03:24.040 --> 03:26.349
She didn't have any references at all.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.508
Well, she worked the
copying and adding machines.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.148
No confidential duties.

03:34.320 --> 03:38.279
(Strutt) Mr Rutland.
I didn't know you were in town.

03:38.440 --> 03:41.273
Just had a robbery. Almost $1 0,000.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.512
So I gathered. By a pretty girl
with no references.

03:44.680 --> 03:48.229
You remember her. I pointed her out to
you last time you were here.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.439
You said something about how I was
improving the looks of the place.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.309
Oh, that one!
The brunette with the legs.

03:56.480 --> 04:00.075
Excuse me. Mr Rutland's a client.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.198
I don't think you've got time
to discuss business today, Mr Strutt,

04:03.360 --> 04:05.316
what with your crime wave
on your hands.

04:05.480 --> 04:08.995
Oh, no, no. Always time for
Rutland business. You know that.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.390
How are things in Philadelphia?

04:11.560 --> 04:15.872
The little witch! I'll have her
put away for 20 years!

04:16.040 --> 04:18.315
I knew she was too good to be true.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.598
Always so eager to work
overtime, never made a mistake.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.194
Always pulling her skirt
down over her knees

04:25.360 --> 04:28.796
as though they were
a national treasure.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.155
She seemed so nice, so efficient.

04:31.320 --> 04:34.437
- So -
- Resourceful?

Hello, Mrs Maitland.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.671
Oh, so nice to have you back,
Miss Edgar.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.912
- We put you in your same room.
- Thank you, Mrs Maitland.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.111
Can someone drive me over
to Garrod's right away?

07:23.280 --> 07:28.149
- Of course. Anytime you're ready.
- Soon as I change.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.038
How do, Miss Edgar?
Good to have you back.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.599
Hello, Mr Garrod.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.273
Ah, there's my darling!

07:49.440 --> 07:52.830
(Garrod) That big spoiled baby
of yours knew something was up.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.877
Tried to bite me twice
already this morning.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.476
Forio, if you want
to bite somebody, bite me.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.911
Thanks.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.318
(Girls) # Mother, Mother, I am ill.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.357
# Send for the doctor over the hill.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.080
# Call for the doctor.
Call for the nurse.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.073
# Call for the lady
with the alligator purse.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.913
# Mumps said the doctor.
Measles said the nurse.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.833
# Nothing said the lady
with the alligator purse. #

08:52.000 --> 08:53.399
Thank you.

08:53.880 --> 08:58.476
(Girls) One, two, three,
four, five, six -

08:58.640 --> 09:00.995
Oh, it's you. Where's my mother?

09:01.760 --> 09:04.433
She's makin' a pecan pie... for me!

09:06.280 --> 09:08.350
That figures.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.673
(Woman) Who is it, Jessie?

09:15.840 --> 09:18.877
- Hello, Mama.
- Well, I just swan. Marnie!

09:19.040 --> 09:20.996
If you're not the very limit.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.994
I can't take in the way you jump
all over the place like you do.

09:25.720 --> 09:29.235
(Mama) Boston, Massachusetts.
Elizabeth, New Jersey.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.950
I brought you
some chrysanthemums.

09:33.120 --> 09:38.752
Those gladiolas are brand fresh.
Miss Cotton brought 'em last night.

09:38.960 --> 09:42.032
I never could stand gladiolas.
I ' ll get rid of these.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.431
For land's sake - Marnie,
now watch the dripping.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.593
Here, Jessica, why don't you
take these home to your mother?

09:48.760 --> 09:50.716
She don't get home from work till 6::00.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.838
I'm supposed to stay here till 6::00.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.195
Take them to the kitchen then.
Just get rid of them.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.673
Take 'em to the kitchen
before they drip all over.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.159
We could stand gladiolas!

10:06.280 --> 10:09.272
I send you plenty of money.
You don't have to be a baby-sitter.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.955
Whoever said I did have to?
It's my pleasure.

10:13.720 --> 10:16.439
That smart little ol' Jessie.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.319
Marnie, if you could just hear
some of the things that she says.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.550
Oh, but I do.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.711
Seems I get a report
in exhaustive detail

10:23.880 --> 10:27.190
on all the bright sayings
of ol' Jessie Cotton.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.237
What's more, every time I come home,
she's roosting here.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.349
I see that you've lighted up
your hair, Marnie.

10:36.520 --> 10:40.433
- A little. Why? Don't you like it?
- No.

10:41.160 --> 10:45.597
Too-blonde hair always looks like a
woman's tryin' to attract the man.

10:45.760 --> 10:48.433
Men and a good name
don't go together.

10:50.840 --> 10:53.149
I brought you something, Mama.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.840
Now what have you thrown
good money away on?

10:58.360 --> 11:00.316
Oh, Marnie.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.597
You shouldn't spend all your money
on me like you do.

11:03.760 --> 11:06.115
But that's what
money's for: to spend.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.748
Like the Bible says,
"Money answereth all things."

11:09.960 --> 11:14.511
We don't talk smart about the Bible
in this house, missy!

11:19.600 --> 11:23.195
Well, I just swan! How do I wear it?

11:23.360 --> 11:26.716
Like this. Real high up under the chin.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.156
(Marnie) Oh, it's smart,
it's very, very smart.

11:29.320 --> 11:32.949
Goin' around buyin' fur pieces
like they was nothin'.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.395
Mr Pemberton gave me another raise.

11:35.560 --> 11:40.395
I told Miss Cotton my daughter is
private secretary to a millionaire.

11:40.560 --> 11:44.189
He's as generous with her
as if she was his very own daughter.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.352
Miss Bernice, don't you want
to get my hair brushed up

11:47.520 --> 11:50.557
- before my mommy gets home?
- I sure do, honey.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.870
You run up and get the brush.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.635
Oh, that kid and her hair.

11:57.480 --> 12:01.439
Puts me in mind of yours
when you was little. The colour.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.234
This side of the street
don't get the afternoon sun.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.675
My hip and my leg
ache me somethin' awful.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.918
(Footsteps)

12:15.800 --> 12:18.439
I got the hairbrush!

12:19.840 --> 12:22.798
Uh, Marnie, mind my leg.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.554
(Mama) I never had time
to take care of Marnie 's hair

12:43.720 --> 12:45.676
when she was a little kid like you.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.957
- How come?
- Oh, child!

12:49.120 --> 12:52.476
Well, after I had my bad accident,

12:52.640 --> 12:55.996
first I was sick so long,
and then I had to work.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.200
(Jessie) Didn't you all have
a daddy either?

12:59.360 --> 13:03.194
No, we didn't. We surely did not!

13:03.360 --> 13:05.351
There.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.750
As pretty as brushin' can make you.

13:08.600 --> 13:12.354
Oh, sugarpop, it's five after 6:00.
You better scat on home.

13:12.520 --> 13:16.593
And you be sure to take
your mama those glads.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.753
How ' bout my pie?
How ' bout my pecan pie?

13:21.920 --> 13:24.832
I ' ll get it done tonight
and bring it over to you.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.150
Now, Jessie, you mind
you go straight home.

13:27.320 --> 13:31.518
OK. Bye, Miss Bernice.
See you later, Miss Bernice.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.034
(Door Opens, Closes)

13:36.760 --> 13:39.069
Do you really like the scarf, Mama?

13:39.240 --> 13:41.470
It's real mink.

13:41.640 --> 13:44.074
Oh, there. You look
just like an old man's darling.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.310
No man ever give me
anything so good.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.278
We don't need men, Mama.

13:50.440 --> 13:54.035
We can do very well for ourselves.
You and me.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.078
A decent woman
don't have need for any man.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.198
Look at you, Marnie.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.874
I told Miss Cotton,
look at my girl Marnie.

14:03.080 --> 14:07.631
She's too smart to go gettin' herself
mixed up with men... none of 'em!

14:09.640 --> 14:12.996
Well, let's go on back to the kitchen.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.038
I've got to see to that pie.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.995
Uh, Marnie, I've been
thinking seriously

14:36.160 --> 14:39.038
about asking Miss Cotton and Jessie
to move in here with me.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.919
Miss Cotton is a real nice woman.

14:44.080 --> 14:48.232
She's decent. A hard-working woman
with a little girl to raise.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.079
Come on, Mama, why don't
you just say what you mean?

14:51.240 --> 14:53.356
What you want is for Jessie
to come live with you.

14:56.760 --> 15:00.673
Marnie, you oughtn't let yourself act
jealous of a little ol' kid like that.

15:00.840 --> 15:03.991
She don't bother me none.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.515
And we could always use
the extra money.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.511
The Cottons are mighty decent people.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.194
Why don't you love me, Mama?

15:17.200 --> 15:20.715
I 've always wondered why you don't.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.356
You never give me one part
of the love you give Jessie.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.154
Mama -

15:31.840 --> 15:33.478
Why do you always
move away from me?

15:33.720 --> 15:35.915
Why? What's wrong with me?

15:36.080 --> 15:39.629
Nothing! Nothing's wrong with you.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.199
No. You don't think that.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.555
You've always thought there
was something wrong with me.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.512
- Haven't you? Always!
- I never.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.668
My God! When I think
of the things I've done

15:50.840 --> 15:53.229
to try to make you love me.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.958
The things I've done!

15:56.960 --> 16:00.396
Hm. What are you
thinking now, Mama?

16:00.560 --> 16:03.279
About the things I've done?

16:03.440 --> 16:07.228
What do you think they are?
Things that aren't decent, is that it?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.038
Well, you think
I'm Mr Pemberton's girl.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.713
Is that why you don't
want me to touch you?

16:10.880 --> 16:13.633
Is that how you think I get
the money to set you up?

16:21.440 --> 16:24.716
I'm... I'm sorry, Mama.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.838
I don't know what got
into me talking like that.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.275
I know you've never really
thought anything bad about me.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.079
No, I never.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.988
Well, I'm sorry. I really am.

16:36.160 --> 16:40.278
- I'll pick up the pecans.
- No, you go upstairs and lay down.

16:40.440 --> 16:44.479
You're all wore out. I'll ask Jessie
to come over and pick up the nuts.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.949
Alright.

16:48.120 --> 16:53.114
After all... it is Jessie's pie, isn't it?

17:02.480 --> 17:04.471
(Clunking)

17:12.319 --> 17:15.790
No, I don't want to. Mama, no!

17:16.480 --> 17:19.790
Marnie, wake up. Marnie?

17:19.960 --> 17:22.315
Don't make me move, Mama.
It's too cold.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.596
Wake up, Marnie.
You're still dreaming.

17:26.040 --> 17:29.555
- Get washed up. Supper's ready.
- Oh.

17:30.360 --> 17:33.318
I was having that old dream again.

17:33.480 --> 17:37.314
- First the tapping and then -
- I said supper's ready.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.235
It's always when
you come to the door.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.277
That's when the cold starts.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.873
- Miss Clabon.
- Good morning.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.519
Is Mr Ward in his office?

19:18.680 --> 19:21.274
Yes. He's interviewing for
the new office assistant.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.236
Rutland and Company is
an old established publishing -

19:24.400 --> 19:28.439
- Oh, Mr Rutland.
- This is Miss Blakely, Mr Rutland.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.353
Well done. You'll hear from us,
Miss Blakely, I'm sure.

19:32.520 --> 19:34.829
Thank you for your time, Mr Ward.
Good day, Mr Rutland.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.275
Good day, Miss Blakely.

19:37.440 --> 19:41.513
Well, I guess that does it. She seems
to have the exact qualifications -

19:44.800 --> 19:46.119
Come in for a moment, please.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.633
Now, sit down, Mrs... Taylor.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.791
Thank you.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.913
(Ward) I have here your
Pittsburgh references.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.595
Reference, that is. Kendall's, yes.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.512
This the only reference
you have to show us?

20:10.680 --> 20:14.673
Well, Mr Ward, I have good training,
but I've had very little actual experience.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.637
Kendall ' s was my first real job.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.395
After I finished school, I was married.
My husband was a CPA.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.437
He helped me keep up
with my training.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.637
I learned a great deal more from him:
accounting, cost-price,

20:25.800 --> 20:28.633
- even something about computers.
- (Ward) I see.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.429
When my husband died
very suddenly last November,

20:32.600 --> 20:35.717
he left me a little money,
but I felt I needed work.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.030
Good, hard, demanding work.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.589
I got the job at Kendall's,
but it was -

20:41.760 --> 20:43.239
Well, it wasn't a
very exacting position,

20:43.400 --> 20:47.154
and there didn't seem much chance
for anything else at Kendall's.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.118
I don't mean pay. Salary isn't the most
important thing with me,

20:50.280 --> 20:52.919
but more interesting work, Mr Ward.

20:53.080 --> 20:56.436
Something that
will keep me busy, occupied.

20:57.280 --> 21:00.158
I don't care how much work
I'm given or what hours I work.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.471
(Ward) Uh, Mrs Taylor,
why did you leave Pittsburgh?

21:03.640 --> 21:05.835
After my husband died, I just -

21:06.000 --> 21:08.753
(Ward) Mrs Taylor, this is a post
of some confidence.

21:08.920 --> 21:12.629
(Marnie) Oh, please, let me have
a chance to prove myself, Mr Ward.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.674
Uh... very well, Mrs Taylor.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.551
I suppose you might as well
report to work on Monday.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.914
Miss Clabon in the
outer office will brief you.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.597
I'll be out in just a moment.

21:36.760 --> 21:40.116
Taking her on without references?
You' re always such a stickler -

21:40.280 --> 21:43.909
Let's just say I'm an interested
spectator in the passing parade.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.957
I don't get it.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.395
You're not supposed to get it.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.591
Hi, Miss Clabon.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.955
Hello, Mr Sam.
How's the curmudgeon business?

21:56.120 --> 21:58.350
Oh, Miss Mainwaring!

21:59.200 --> 22:02.829
Is Mark in? I want a free lunch,
and somebody to cash a check.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.275
I thought I'd stick Mark
for the lunch and you for the cash.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.396
Go right on in.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.431
(Ward) You have your
Social Security card, Mrs Taylor?

22:10.600 --> 22:14.513
- Of course. Right here in my purse.
- Who 's the dish?

22:16.280 --> 22:19.716
Miss Clabon will show you around.
She's been with us for seven years.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.714
I believe she finds the work
exacting enough. Good day, Mrs Taylor.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.314
Miss Clabon, will you call personnel
and have them send the forms up?

22:26.480 --> 22:28.835
Certainly, Mr Ward.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.795
(Miss Clabon) Hello.
This is Mr Ward's office.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.669
Would you send up a W-4
and the rest of the employment forms?

22:40.840 --> 22:42.910
Yes, before lunch. I'll wait.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.196
Thank you.

22:45.360 --> 22:49.148
Maud, what about Saturday?

22:49.320 --> 22:51.914
No, I only thought as you said
your mother wasn 't coming with us,

22:52.080 --> 22:54.355
I just wanted to make sure
about our reservations.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.199
Well, why don 't you call me back?

22:59.560 --> 23:01.198
Alright. Anytime.

23:06.120 --> 23:09.829
Thanks, Mr Sam, I ' ll try not
to do anything sensible with it.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.436
- Bye, Miss Clabon.
- Bye.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.910
That's Lil Mainwaring,
Mr Rutland's sister-in-law.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.918
- Her sister was Mr Rutland's wife.
- Was?

23:21.080 --> 23:23.674
She died about a year and a half ago.
Some kind of heart thing.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.350
Imagine. Only 29.

23:26.520 --> 23:28.954
Well, anyway,
she kind of brought Lil up.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.715
Lil lived with them
and old Mr Rutland down at Wykwyn.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.473
I get the feeling little ol' Lil
plans to stay on... permanently.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.990
Anyway, like I was saying,
old Mr Rutland - that's Mark's father -

24:39.160 --> 24:41.549
they say he's never
even been inside this place.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.757
The company was headed into
the ground when Mark took over.

24:44.920 --> 24:49.436
They say the first week
he was here he retired... ha, retired,

24:49.600 --> 24:53.036
three board members, the acting
president, the president's secretary.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.033
Coffee time, ladies.

25:00.840 --> 25:04.549
- Do you mind bringing me a cup?
- Just coffee? Donut, Danish?

25:04.720 --> 25:08.554
- Lady, have I got for you a Danish!
- No, just coffee.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.632
- Oh, I'm out of red ink.
- Oh, here, use mine.

25:11.880 --> 25:14.758
- I'll get it.
- No, no, I will.

25:17.720 --> 25:19.039
Thanks.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.597
Mrs Taylor, are you hurt?

25:41.760 --> 25:44.149
(Mark) Mrs Taylor!

25:44.880 --> 25:46.438
I think she's hurt. Find out!

25:47.840 --> 25:50.195
Mary, are you alright?

25:51.160 --> 25:52.718
What?

25:52.880 --> 25:55.474
Of course, I'm alright. I just
spilled a little ink on my blouse.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.552
The way you rushed out of the office -
Mr Rutland's standing out there.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.915
- He said he thought you were hurt.
- Well, I'm not.

26:01.080 --> 26:04.595
All that happened was I spilled
a little ink on my blouse.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.479
Good heavens! What a lot
of excitement over nothing.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.432
(Phone Ringing)

26:38.720 --> 26:41.393
Why in the world does he keep locking
and unlocking that drawer?

26:41.560 --> 26:43.630
He never can remember
the safe combination.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.119
It's locked in that drawer.

26:45.280 --> 26:47.555
Mr Rutland and I have keys too,
for emergencies.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.791
It's only five numbers,
for Pete's sake.

26:53.720 --> 26:57.315
Mrs Taylor? I've just had a call from
Mr Rutland, Mrs Taylor.

26:58.520 --> 27:01.512
He remembered your saying
you'd be willing to work overtime.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.430
He wondered if you'd be prepared
to work on Saturday?

27:04.600 --> 27:08.434
- Saturday? Of course. What time?
- Two-thirty.

27:08.600 --> 27:11.114
I ' ll advise Mr Rutland
that you are available.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.434
(Thunderclaps)

28:00.640 --> 28:03.518
- (Knocking)
- (Mark) Come in, Mrs Taylor.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.519
Good afternoon, Mr Rutland.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.915
Are you interested in
pre-Columbian art, Mrs Taylor?

28:16.600 --> 28:19.398
Those were collected
by my wife. She's dead.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.152
The only things of hers I 've kept.

28:22.680 --> 28:26.195
And that's Sophie. She 's a jaguarundi.

28:26.360 --> 28:30.035
South American. I, uh... trained her.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.156
Oh? What did you train her to do?

28:32.880 --> 28:34.154
To trust me.

28:34.680 --> 28:35.999
Is that all?

28:36.360 --> 28:38.635
That's a great deal...
for a jaguarundi.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.359
Shall we get to work?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.956
You can use the typewriter over there.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.395
I want an original
and one copy of this.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.391
If you can't decipher
any of this, speak up.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.358
I typed it myself and
I'm a very creative typist.

28:57.960 --> 29:01.350
"Arboreal Predators
of the Brazilian Rain Forest."

29:01.520 --> 29:04.273
Before I was drafted
into Rutland's, Mrs Taylor,

29:04.440 --> 29:06.112
I had notions of being a zoologist.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.590
- I still try to keep up with my field.
- Zoos?

29:10.840 --> 29:12.239
Instinctual behaviour.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.836
Oh. Does zoology include people,
Mr Rutland?

29:16.560 --> 29:19.233
Well, in a way. It includes all
the animal ancestors

29:19.400 --> 29:21.118
from whom man derived his instincts.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.512
Ladies' instincts too?

29:24.520 --> 29:26.875
That paper deals with
the instincts of predators.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.349
What you might call the criminal class
of the animal world.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.790
Lady animals figure
very largely as predators.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.958
(Thunderclaps)

29:50.840 --> 29:52.512
Put on the overhead light if you like.

29:52.680 --> 29:55.069
The switch is by the door.

29:57.040 --> 29:59.235
(Thunderclaps)

30:09.480 --> 30:11.311
Why don't you sit down, Mrs Taylor?

30:11.480 --> 30:15.553
If the storm worries you that much,
I'll get you something to drink.

30:17.320 --> 30:19.356
Mrs Taylor?

30:30.160 --> 30:33.277
The building is grounded, Mrs Taylor.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.998
You' re quite safe here...

30:39.880 --> 30:41.313
from the lightning.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.271
The colours! Stop the colours!

30:48.440 --> 30:50.829
What colours?

31:26.640 --> 31:30.235
It's over. All over. You're alright.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.758
OK now? Would you like something
to drink? Some brandy?

31:34.920 --> 31:39.198
- No, thank you. I'm awfully sorry.
- Oh, don't be silly.

31:39.360 --> 31:43.114
- Why do colours bother you?
- Colours?

31:43.280 --> 31:45.748
You seem to be terrified
of some colours.

31:45.920 --> 31:50.391
No, no. What I'm terrified
of is thunder and lightning.

31:50.560 --> 31:54.519
I wouldn't have pegged you as a woman
terrified of anything.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.116
Well, we've all got to go sometime.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.399
Look, this place is wrecked
and you're in no state to work.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.710
Suppose I drive you home.
You can do this job some other time.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.792
- Thank you. I -
- Go get your things.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.239
It's cold and damp here.

32:25.400 --> 32:28.597
I must get the maintenance people in.

32:45.280 --> 32:49.273
- I'm really sorry about the cabinet.
- Why should you be?

32:49.440 --> 32:51.954
You said it was all
you had left of your wife.

32:52.120 --> 32:55.237
I said it was all I had left
that had belonged to my wife.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.356
Oh.

32:58.760 --> 33:01.115
(Car Radio) "Native Winkler is second.
Hopeless is third."

33:01.280 --> 33:03.999
Oh, no please. I'd like to hear.

33:04.160 --> 33:06.230
- You like racing?
- I like horses.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.550
I go to the races when I can.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.759
- Was your husband a track fan?
- Yes.

33:12.920 --> 33:15.912
- And you go alone now?
- Yes.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.637
Atlantic City track's open
till the end of the month.

33:19.800 --> 33:22.917
We could drive out there next Saturday.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.672
Alright.

33:24.840 --> 33:27.798
- Are you fond of horses?
- No, not at all.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.511
(PA Announcer) "Fast Return
moving up on the outside. "

33:35.120 --> 33:37.793
(Announcer Continues)

33:54.280 --> 33:56.510
Well, that's another one.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.159
Oh, I like it here like this.

33:59.320 --> 34:03.552
You' re the expert.
What do you like in the next race?

34:03.720 --> 34:06.188
Lemon Pudding. He's finished third
his last three times out.

34:06.360 --> 34:09.397
- Got a good jockey up today.
- Lemon Pudding it is.

34:09.560 --> 34:14.156
The morning line says he's four to one.
I'll get on him.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.159
(Man) Pardon me.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.550
But you're Peggy Nicholson, aren't you?

34:23.199 --> 34:24.518
Remember me?

34:25.639 --> 34:27.358
I'm sorry. What did you say?

34:27.520 --> 34:31.513
- Aren't you Peggy Nicholson?
- No, I'm not.

34:31.679 --> 34:35.434
Yeah? I was pretty sure you were.
When I first saw you down here -

34:35.600 --> 34:38.751
I'm sorry, you've made a mistake.
I am not Miss Nichols.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.036
- Nicholson.
- Nicholson.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.638
Frank Abernathy introduced us
a couple of years ago in Detroit.

34:46.320 --> 34:49.197
Frank Abernathy.
You remember Frank.

34:49.360 --> 34:51.748
No, I do not know anyone
named Frank Abernathy.

34:51.920 --> 34:55.514
I have never known anyone
named Frank Abernathy.

34:55.679 --> 34:58.069
- Now, will you please go?
- Aw, come on now, honey.

34:58.240 --> 35:00.390
You're trying to pull my leg,
aren't you?

35:00.560 --> 35:02.835
(Mark) Now, why should any young lady
want to pull your leg?

35:03.480 --> 35:06.677
Oh, sorry. I thought
I recognised this lady.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.398
- Did he recognise you?
- No.

35:08.560 --> 35:12.269
- You did not recognise her.
- I said I thought I recognised her.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.159
- I said I'm sorry.
- Good for you. You've apologised.

35:15.320 --> 35:17.709
You may go now.

35:21.960 --> 35:25.236
- You came back so quickly.
- Yes. Who's your fan?

35:25.400 --> 35:27.630
I just seem to have one of those faces.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.032
Well, what do you like
in the next race?

35:30.200 --> 35:32.839
Can we go to the paddock?
I'd like to see Telepathy.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.879
Been watching him ever since I saw him
work out once as a two-year-old.

35:59.760 --> 36:02.718
Oh, I believe that's
our old friend Telepathy.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.350
Yeah, number eight. Telepathy.

36:12.440 --> 36:16.115
He 's a lanky-looking piece of business,
but I bow to your superior knowledge.

36:16.280 --> 36:19.317
- What is it? What ' s the matter?
- Don't bet him.

36:19.480 --> 36:22.119
- Why not?
- He's walleyed.

36:22.280 --> 36:25.033
Can we go now?

36:36.400 --> 36:40.188
What a paragon you are.
You don't smoke, drink or gamble.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.711
Just this once... for luck.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.599
- I don't believe in luck.
- What do you believe in?

36:46.600 --> 36:47.919
Nothing.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.356
Oh, horses, maybe.
At least they're beautiful,

36:51.520 --> 36:53.795
and nothing in this world like people.

36:54.760 --> 36:56.830
Oh, yes, people. A thoroughly bad lot.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.479
Generally.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.710
Did you have a tough childhood,
Mrs Taylor?

37:00.880 --> 37:02.199
Not particularly

37:03.280 --> 37:07.398
I think you did. I think you've had
a hard, tough climb.

37:07.560 --> 37:09.790
But you're a smart girl, aren't you?

37:09.960 --> 37:12.349
The careful grammar,
the quiet good manners.

37:12.520 --> 37:15.830
- Where did you learn them?
- From my betters.

37:16.840 --> 37:19.308
What about your tough childhood,
Mr Rutland?

37:19.480 --> 37:22.517
The old, sad story.
Promising youth blighted.

37:22.680 --> 37:26.355
Dragged down by money,
position, noblesse oblige.

37:27.320 --> 37:30.392
By the time I came along,
the company was hanging on the ropes.

37:30.560 --> 37:33.518
We had about 1,000 employees who were
about to go down for the count.

37:33.680 --> 37:34.999
What about the Rutlands?

37:35.160 --> 37:37.071
What would've happened to your family?

37:37.240 --> 37:39.470
Nothing ever happens to a family that
traditionally marries

37:39.640 --> 37:41.631
at least one heiress
every other generation.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.119
(Crowd Cheering)

37:44.840 --> 37:49.914
You shouldn't've chickened. Your
walleyed reject just won by 4 lengths.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.630
I think I've had enough. Can we go?

37:54.800 --> 37:56.119
If you like.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.111
The track's open
till the end of the month.

37:58.280 --> 38:01.078
That gives us two more Saturdays.

38:01.240 --> 38:05.916
If your luck holds out, by this time
next month, I'll be a rich man.

38:13.880 --> 38:17.793
- Oh, Miss Nicholson.
- You really are pressing your luck.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.313
Where are we going this time?

38:27.480 --> 38:30.790
I thought it was time I brought you
home to meet my old man.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.918
- You should've told me.
- You're alright.

38:34.080 --> 38:37.675
Dad goes by scent. If you smell
anything like a horse, you're in.

38:55.160 --> 38:58.630
Here we are, old bean. The homestead.

39:12.040 --> 39:14.713
- Hello, Dad.
- Who's this?

39:14.880 --> 39:16.757
This is Mary Taylor.
Mary, this is my father.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.990
- How do you do, Mr Rutland?
- A girl, is it?

39:19.160 --> 39:22.470
It's alright, Dad. She's not really
a girl, she's a horse-fancier.

39:22.640 --> 39:25.234
The track's closed. I thought if
I brought her to see your horses,

39:25.400 --> 39:28.233
- I'd hold her attention a bit longer.
- Splendid, splendid!

39:28.400 --> 39:32.439
Come along, my dear.
I was just about to have a cup of tea.

39:38.160 --> 39:40.754
Oh, Mary, this is my
sister-in-law, Lil Mainwaring.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.672
- Mary Taylor.
- How do you do?

39:43.080 --> 39:45.071
Hi. I've seen you
at Rutland's, haven't I?

39:45.240 --> 39:49.552
(Rutland) It bewilders me what any
of you can find to do at Rutland's.

39:52.040 --> 39:55.669
Oh, dear! I think I rather sprained
my wrist this afternoon.

39:56.040 --> 40:00.830
There 's sure to be droppage
and spillage. Would you mind awfully?

40:02.280 --> 40:05.909
(Rutland) Strong, please.
No milk, two lumps of sugar.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.435
The meals in this house
are shocking bad,

40:08.600 --> 40:11.114
but I do insist on good
Horn and Hardart cake at tea.

40:11.280 --> 40:14.431
You take yours with lemon,
don't you, Lil?

40:14.600 --> 40:16.955
Yes, lemon for Lil, Mary.

40:18.480 --> 40:20.471
Strong with a dash of rum for me.

40:20.640 --> 40:23.996
(Rutland) Spinster's tea.
Mucking up tea with strong drink.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.709
- Something sneaky about it, eh?
- What's your opinion, Miss Taylor?

40:27.880 --> 40:30.189
Do you think old Mark here
is a sneaky one?

40:31.120 --> 40:33.350
Possibly.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.876
How do you take your tea, Miss Taylor?

40:37.040 --> 40:39.190
Usually with a cup
of hot water and a tea bag.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.669
(Rutland) Lazy habit, my dear.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.308
I'll have quite a large slice
of that butter cake, please.

40:44.480 --> 40:47.074
- Do you ride, Miss Taylor?
- A little.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.470
Best thing in the world
for the inside of a man or woman

40:49.640 --> 40:51.676
is the outside of a horse.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.751
I shouldn't think you'd find
old Mark very interesting.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.998
- Doesn't hunt. Doesn't even ride!
- Please, Dad!

40:56.160 --> 40:58.276
I was hoping to lead up
gently to all that.

40:58.440 --> 41:00.954
I'd even planned to show her
the horses first.

41:01.680 --> 41:03.830
Swill that down or bring it
with you to the stables.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.833
Mark's trying to act as if he brought
Miss Taylor out to see the horses.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.197
- He really brought her to see me.
- Really? Whatever for?

41:10.360 --> 41:12.715
Showing off. I'm quite
a presentable old party, you know.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.510
Lil, I 'm sure your sturdy young wrist

41:15.680 --> 41:18.877
has recovered sufficiently
to pour Dad another cup of tea.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.156
- I will have another cup.
- I can't!

41:21.320 --> 41:23.754
"When duty whispers low, thou must."

41:23.920 --> 41:27.310
"Then youth replies, I can."

41:27.480 --> 41:31.109
Ratfink! And you misquoted!

41:57.240 --> 41:59.470
Will you come up and spend
next weekend with us?

41:59.640 --> 42:03.997
You can bring your tea bag,
have your pick of the horses.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.398
Good night, Mary. I have to run.
See you on Monday.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.596
Good night, Susan.

42:16.520 --> 42:19.159
(Woman) Good night. See you on Monday.

42:36.560 --> 42:39.552
I haven't got my powder puff.
Have you got one?

42:40.320 --> 42:42.880
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.474
- Come on.
- Alright, I'm coming.

42:46.640 --> 42:49.632
You mean we have to hang around
and wait until he calls?

42:49.800 --> 42:52.519
- Good night, girls.
- Good night. I'll see you.

42:52.680 --> 42:54.272
- Have a good weekend.
- Yeah.

42:54.440 --> 42:56.795
I think that's terrible.

42:56.960 --> 42:59.110
- What are you gonna do?
- I don 't know. Let's get home.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.599
He may have already called you.

43:00.760 --> 43:02.591
If I miss his call,
that's the way it goes.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.910
This is the best one you 've had!

43:05.080 --> 43:06.638
(Door Closes)

43:19.840 --> 43:21.751
(Indistinct Chatting)

46:27.000 --> 46:28.877
(Clunking Noise)

46:39.160 --> 46:42.152
(Door Opens, Closes)

46:50.680 --> 46:52.989
You' re sure makin' time tonight, Rita.
What's the big rush?

46:53.160 --> 46:56.436
I wanna get to bed.
That's the big rush.

47:28.920 --> 47:31.150
Please get down.

47:31.320 --> 47:34.517
You'll walk back to the stables.
I'll ride.

47:35.520 --> 47:38.990
Are you stayin' at an inn or have you
friends among the local gentry?

47:39.160 --> 47:42.072
- You said you didn't trust horses.
- I don't, but they trust me.

47:42.240 --> 47:45.755
Which brings us directly to our
relationship, Miss Edgar!

47:55.960 --> 47:59.873
Is Edgar your real name?
And you're blonde.

48:00.040 --> 48:03.749
You'll save time and make for better
feeling if you tell me the truth.

48:03.920 --> 48:07.549
Is Edgar your real name?
Now, don't crowd me, lady!

48:07.720 --> 48:10.075
I'm fighting a powerful impulse
to beat the hell out of you.

48:12.360 --> 48:13.679
At last we communicate.

48:14.120 --> 48:17.157
Now, for the third and last time,
is Edgar your real name?

48:17.320 --> 48:19.754
And don't bother to lie to me.
I'll check you out in every detail.

48:19.920 --> 48:23.469
- Yes. Margaret Edgar.
- Where are you from?

48:24.520 --> 48:25.873
California.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.598
- Where in California?
- Los Angeles.

48:27.760 --> 48:29.113
Where's the money?

48:32.480 --> 48:34.550
Here! Some of it.

48:34.720 --> 48:36.836
- Where 's the rest?
- Don't worry. It's safe.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.913
Safe? At some pari-mutuel window?
Or gone on mother's operation?

48:41.080 --> 48:43.753
Or perhaps you're putting
your kid brother through school?

48:43.920 --> 48:46.354
I don't have a kid brother
or a mother. I don't have anybody.

48:46.520 --> 48:47.839
Not even Mr Taylor?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.878
I wouldn't be surprised to hear
the rest of the haul

48:51.040 --> 48:53.315
is with your late husband, Mr Taylor.

48:53.480 --> 48:56.756
Somewhere I expect to find him
happily reincarnated,

48:56.920 --> 48:59.878
the pockets of his good blue burial
suit bulging with Rutland money.

49:00.040 --> 49:02.793
The rest of the money is in
a registered package addressed to me

49:02.960 --> 49:04.552
in a post office box in New York.

49:04.720 --> 49:07.439
You can pick it up there by tomorrow.
Here's the key.

49:07.600 --> 49:10.876
Thank you, Miss Edgar.
Now I'll take the registration receipt.

49:13.560 --> 49:16.950
This receipt and the package are
as good as a signed confession.

49:17.120 --> 49:20.237
You understand that? Alright.
Now, where does Mr Taylor come in?

49:20.400 --> 49:23.233
There's no such person.
I 've never been married.

49:23.400 --> 49:25.436
Mrs Taylor was an old
friend of my mother's.

49:25.600 --> 49:28.672
And when you applied at Rutland's,
the name just came to your mind.

49:28.840 --> 49:32.469
I was trying to get away from my
cousin Jessie. She's no good.

49:32.640 --> 49:36.189
If she found out about the insurance
money, she'd try to get some.

49:36.360 --> 49:37.679
Make trouble for me.

49:37.840 --> 49:41.150
- What insurance money?
- Mrs Taylor's.

49:41.320 --> 49:44.232
- She died.
- Oh, Mrs Taylor died. Pity.

49:44.400 --> 49:46.914
Now you're working with
this naughty cousin Jessie.

49:47.080 --> 49:48.433
Nobody's working with me!

49:48.600 --> 49:51.672
You talk as if this was some
regular thing I do... did.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.398
All planned in cold blood.

49:53.560 --> 49:56.120
- And it wasn't?
- No!

49:56.280 --> 49:58.350
You're not from Los Angeles,
Miss Edgar.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.750
Insurance is only pronounced
insurance in the South.

50:00.920 --> 50:03.309
And that's where you're from.
Where? Around here?

50:03.480 --> 50:06.313
You' re a cold-practised,
method-actress of a liar.

50:06.480 --> 50:08.789
- I can't help it.
- It would appear not.

50:08.960 --> 50:12.350
I don't mean that.
I mean, I wasn't born in California.

50:12.520 --> 50:14.397
I was born in Richmond, Virginia.

50:14.560 --> 50:16.551
My father deserted us
when I was a baby.

50:16.720 --> 50:19.917
My mother and I lived
in Richmond until I was seven.

50:20.080 --> 50:24.232
Then we went to California.
Mother worked in aeroplane factories.

50:24.400 --> 50:26.152
That's the truth. I swear it!

50:26.320 --> 50:30.677
My mother died when I was ten.
And Mrs Taylor took care of me.

50:30.840 --> 50:32.910
Come on, get moving.

50:34.680 --> 50:35.999
How did you find me?

50:36.160 --> 50:38.958
You're here to answer
the questions, ol' girl.

50:39.120 --> 50:41.236
How did you get
the combination to Ward's safe?

50:41.400 --> 50:45.678
- I took Susan's key from her purse.
- I see.

50:45.840 --> 50:49.628
Now, suppose you just begin
at the beginning.

50:49.800 --> 50:54.555
It's just like I told you. I was born
in Richmond. We were poor.

50:54.720 --> 50:57.757
We were grindingly poor.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.073
- I was so alone after Mother died.
- Well, go on.

51:05.240 --> 51:08.596
You still have my attention.

51:08.760 --> 51:13.550
I just went to school and took care
of Mrs Taylor until she died.

51:13.720 --> 51:18.271
She left me her house
and $5,000 in insurance.

51:21.160 --> 51:26.188
I sold the house. It had a mortgage
so I only got $9,000 cash.

51:26.960 --> 51:30.953
But there I was with $14,000! Me!

51:31.120 --> 51:33.429
I could do exactly
what I wanted to with it.

51:34.960 --> 51:37.155
There isn't much more. I bought Forio.

51:37.320 --> 51:40.312
- Forio?
- My horse at Garrod's.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.755
I had two wonderful years.

51:42.920 --> 51:46.196
Then last November it was all gone
so I had to get a job.

51:46.360 --> 51:48.351
I went to Pittsburgh
and got the job at Kendall's

51:48.520 --> 51:50.511
until I could look around
for something better.

51:50.680 --> 51:52.272
Alright, let's try again.

51:52.440 --> 51:57.434
Let's back up and turn that Mt Everest
of manure into a few facts.

51:57.600 --> 51:59.113
One: Your dates are all wrong.

51:59.280 --> 52:01.874
Previously you were employed
by the firm of Strutt and Company.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.951
I saw you there once.

52:04.120 --> 52:08.033
Mr Strutt is the tax consultant
for Rutland and Company.

52:08.200 --> 52:10.475
He pointed you out to me.
You were a brunette then.

52:10.640 --> 52:14.030
Then some months later,
he pointed out your absence.

52:14.200 --> 52:16.395
You mean, you knew all
about that when you hired me?

52:16.560 --> 52:18.516
No. I wasn't positive.

52:18.680 --> 52:22.514
But I thought it might be interesting
to keep you around.

52:22.680 --> 52:25.911
And all this time you've been trying
to trip me up, trap me!

52:27.760 --> 52:29.557
Um, I 'm not sure any more.

52:29.720 --> 52:32.917
I think I was just... curious at first.

52:33.080 --> 52:37.039
Then things got out of control and...
I liked you.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.633
So I see!

52:39.800 --> 52:41.677
Incidentally, I think
you took a bit of a chance,

52:41.840 --> 52:45.549
knowing that Rutland's
was a client of Strutt's.

52:45.720 --> 52:46.709
I didn't.

52:46.880 --> 52:50.156
My job at Strutt's didn't give me
access to all the clients' names!

52:51.880 --> 52:54.713
Alright. Let's... get on.

52:54.880 --> 52:56.836
We've established that
you're a thief and a liar.

52:57.320 --> 52:58.639
Now, what is the degree?

52:58.800 --> 53:01.712
Are you a compulsive thief?
A pathological liar?

53:01.880 --> 53:04.713
- What difference does it make?
- Some!

53:05.920 --> 53:08.070
It makes some difference... to me.

53:13.640 --> 53:15.631
Have you ever been in jail?

53:15.800 --> 53:17.631
Certainly not.

53:19.280 --> 53:21.919
I know you'll never believe me now,
and it's my own fault.

53:22.680 --> 53:25.114
It's true about Strutt. I did it.

53:25.280 --> 53:29.398
I don't know why.
I just kind of went crazy, I guess, but...

53:29.560 --> 53:32.711
Old Mr Strutt was so -
Oh, I hated him!

53:33.680 --> 53:34.999
Like you hate me?

53:37.080 --> 53:38.399
Oh, no, not you.

53:47.120 --> 53:49.475
Clean up your face.

53:53.520 --> 53:55.238
Come on.

54:23.720 --> 54:26.154
Good afternoon.

54:34.280 --> 54:37.511
- What'll you folks have?
- A frank and a coffee, please.

54:37.680 --> 54:39.272
- Same for me.
- (Waitress) Okey-doke.

54:41.120 --> 54:43.270
Let's get on
with that little discussion.

54:44.320 --> 54:47.630
The chronic use of an alias is not
consistent with your story

54:47.800 --> 54:51.190
of sudden temptation
and unpremeditated impulse.

54:52.440 --> 54:54.670
What if you'd stolen almost $1 0,000?

54:54.840 --> 54:56.319
Wouldn't you change your name?

54:57.760 --> 55:00.228
Oh, what's the use? Why should I even
try to make you understand?

55:00.400 --> 55:02.755
I'm not only trying to understand you,
I'm trying to believe you!

55:02.920 --> 55:05.150
- Why?
- Because, damn it, I want to!

55:05.320 --> 55:08.118
Can you understand that?

55:08.760 --> 55:10.557
Here you are, folks.

55:11.800 --> 55:13.552
Mark?

55:15.120 --> 55:19.033
The reasons for what I did
at Rutland's,

55:19.200 --> 55:22.875
they were so mixed up,
what I wanted to say before.

55:24.200 --> 55:29.752
I needed to get away, can't you see?
Away from Rutland's.

55:31.080 --> 55:33.469
Don't you understand?
Things were - We were -

55:33.640 --> 55:36.359
So we were.
Was that any reason to run away?

55:36.520 --> 55:38.909
Yes. I thought it was time
I got out before I got hurt.

55:39.080 --> 55:41.674
I mean, why try to kid myself?

55:41.840 --> 55:44.274
- Are you called Margaret?
- Marnie.

55:47.200 --> 55:51.671
- Oh, God, Mark, if you let me go -
- I can't let you go, Marnie.

55:51.840 --> 55:55.037
Somebody's got to take care of you
and help you. I can't turn you loose.

55:55.200 --> 55:59.273
If I let you go, I 'm criminally
and morally responsible.

55:59.760 --> 56:01.079
Then what -

56:02.000 --> 56:05.913
Marnie. Yeah, that suits you.

56:07.480 --> 56:09.516
Alright, Marnie,
this is how it's gonna be.

56:10.480 --> 56:13.074
I'm driving you back to Philadelphia.

56:13.240 --> 56:15.993
Tonight we'll go to the house.
Tomorrow you'll go to Rutland's.

56:16.160 --> 56:19.516
You' ll see that Susan's key finds
its way back into her purse.

56:19.680 --> 56:21.477
How can I go back to Rutland's?

56:21.640 --> 56:24.632
You' re covered. I replaced the money.

56:25.520 --> 56:27.875
When I called yesterday
and found you'd pulled out,

56:28.040 --> 56:29.837
I knew instantly what had happened.

56:30.440 --> 56:32.908
So I went to Rutland's
and checked Ward's safe.

56:33.080 --> 56:37.437
Figured the loss and replaced it.
Then I set out to find you.

56:38.280 --> 56:41.989
Remember at the races
when you were hot about Telepathy?

56:43.080 --> 56:45.878
You'd said you'd watched him
training as a two-year-old.

56:46.040 --> 56:49.271
That's all I had to go on,
so I looked him up,

56:49.440 --> 56:52.432
and found he'd been bred by
a Colonel Marston of Virginia.

56:52.840 --> 56:57.868
I phoned Marston and asked him
if anyone there had horses for hire.

56:58.040 --> 56:59.553
He gave me the names of three.

57:00.800 --> 57:03.872
Yesterday I drove up to the plains,
checked out the stables. No luck.

57:04.040 --> 57:07.510
But at the last place, the man said
why didn't I try Garrod's

57:07.680 --> 57:10.035
over by Middleburg?

57:11.200 --> 57:12.872
(Waitress) You folks be sure
and come back now.

57:15.720 --> 57:17.597
Why are you taking me
back to Wykwyn?

57:18.720 --> 57:20.438
Because I don't trust you
not to run away.

57:20.600 --> 57:22.750
How can I run away?

57:22.920 --> 57:25.480
You have the receipt,
the post office key,

57:25.640 --> 57:28.359
- my name.
- Margaret Edgar.

57:28.520 --> 57:29.999
You sure that's
all the name you have?

57:30.160 --> 57:32.913
You sure you haven't misplaced an old
husband or two in your travels?

57:33.080 --> 57:35.071
I told you I 've never been married.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.399
- Near misses?
- No!

57:38.240 --> 57:40.390
And no lovers, no steadies, no beaus,

57:40.560 --> 57:42.391
no gentlemen callers, nothing!

57:43.440 --> 57:44.919
OK. Eat up.

57:48.480 --> 57:51.597
- Mark, I'd like to go freshen up.
- Uh-uh.

57:51.760 --> 57:54.593
You're fresh enough. Come on.

58:04.880 --> 58:06.438
You know, I can't believe you, Marnie.

58:06.600 --> 58:09.239
There must've been a great
many men interested in you.

58:09.400 --> 58:12.836
I didn't say men weren't interested
in me. I wasn't interested in them.

58:13.360 --> 58:15.271
- Never?
- No!

58:16.960 --> 58:19.076
That is... not until -

58:20.480 --> 58:23.790
- Why me?
- Because you were different, Mark.

58:25.280 --> 58:26.952
It won't wash, Marnie.

58:27.560 --> 58:29.471
But it's true! I really liked you.

58:31.120 --> 58:32.439
Yes, I think you did.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.195
But don't try to make it sound
like any more than that.

58:36.200 --> 58:38.316
When we get home,

58:38.480 --> 58:41.597
I'll explain that we had a lover's
quarrel. That you ran away.

58:41.760 --> 58:43.830
That I went after you
and brought you back.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.639
That'll please Dad. He admires action.

58:47.240 --> 58:50.516
Then I ' ll explain that we' re gonna be
married before the week is out,

58:51.040 --> 58:52.598
therefore you should stay on at Wykwyn.

58:52.760 --> 58:55.035
That I can't bear to
have you out of my sight.

58:55.200 --> 58:57.350
He also admires wholesome animal lust.

58:58.760 --> 59:01.115
We 'll be married just
as soon as the law allows.

59:01.280 --> 59:04.078
We 'll catch an outbound boat.
Where do you want to go?

59:04.240 --> 59:07.391
- You ever been to the South Seas?
- What are you trying to pull?

59:08.440 --> 59:10.715
I 'm trying to pull... a proposal.

59:11.240 --> 59:12.958
Let's see, how shall I phrase it?

59:13.680 --> 59:16.194
- How ' bout: Will you be mine?
- You're crazy!

59:16.360 --> 59:20.273
- You're out of your mind!
- That's a possibility.

59:20.440 --> 59:22.670
The name. Marnie. Yes, I'll just go on
calling you Marnie.

59:22.840 --> 59:26.435
That's easily explained. Pet name.
But the Taylor.

59:27.400 --> 59:30.358
We'll just have to marry you off
as Mary Taylor. It's perfectly legal.

59:30.520 --> 59:33.751
You can sign yourself Minnie Q Mouse
on a marriage licence,

59:33.920 --> 59:35.319
you're still legally married.

59:35.480 --> 59:37.232
But you know what I am.

59:37.400 --> 59:40.153
I ' m Minnie Q Thief!
I 'm - I 'm a thief and a liar!

59:40.320 --> 59:44.871
It seems to be my misfortune to have
fallen in love with a thief and a liar.

59:45.720 --> 59:47.950
In love?

59:48.840 --> 59:51.195
Oh, Mark, if you love me,
you'll let me go.

59:52.360 --> 59:54.794
Just let me go, Mark, please.

59:55.280 --> 59:57.236
Mark, you don't know me.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:04.312
Listen to me, Mark. I am not like
other people. I know what I am!

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.833
I doubt that you do, Marnie.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.912
We'll just have to deal with
whatever it is that you are.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.870
Whatever you are, I love you.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.880
It's horrible, I know.
But I do love you.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.950
You don't love me.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.429
I'm just something you've caught!

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.955
You think I'm some kind
of animal you've trapped.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.999
That's right, you are.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.596
And I've caught something
really wild this time, haven't I?

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.832
I've tracked you and caught you,
and by God, I'm gonna keep you!

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.879
Oh, and, Marnie, when we get home,

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.918
no cute ideas about absconding
with the Wykwyn silver.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.118
Just get a grip on yourself
for one short week

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.589
and after that
you can take legal possession.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.275
Like you?
Like you take legal possession?

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.199
Yes, if you want to put it that way.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.794
Somebody's gotta take on the
responsibility for you, Marnie.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.597
And it narrows down to a choice of
me or the police, ol' girl.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.234
- Indispensable.
- (Rutland Chuckling)

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.233
Ah, Cousin Bob, I almost forgot.
Do you have the old necessary?

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.594
Have fun, my dear.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.477
Traveller's checks in this.
Letter of credit in this.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.792
Thanks, old man. Will you see about
having my car picked up at the airport?

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.952
Bob is our banking cousin.
A very handy fellow.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.430
Take care, Lil.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.397
We'll send you a noble savage.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.118
- Goodbye, Dad.
- Bye, Mark.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.078
Thank you, Dr Gillian. Without you
it wouldn't have been legal.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.151
It's been a pleasure.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.033
(Rutland) Let's go finish the champagne
and cake before they spirit it away.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.869
Really splendid cake, you know?
I attended to that myself.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.712
I've made the acquaintance
of one of those

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.279
excellent Horn and Hardart executives.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.671
That engagement ring must
have been at least five carats.

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.239
Six and a half.
Blue-white. Perfect stone.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.595
His mother left
perfectly good jewellery.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.432
It's just sitting there at the bank.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.229
He wanted her to have something
that had never belonged to anyone else.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.630
But six and a half carats!

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.795
And cashing in a bond
to pay for a ring.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.155
But he didn't pay for it.
He charged it.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:24.839
I helped him pick it out.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.549
It cost $42,000... plus tax.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.913
Did you say $42,000?

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.753
The man's deranged.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.196
You know what he did to me
last Saturday?

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.512
He came out to the club
waving a check for $7,000,

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.990
and insisted that I break up
my golf game, go in and open the bank,

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.991
and hand over to him $7,000.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.271
Then he drew out -

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.558
Well, let ' s just say, enough to pay for
this trip, plus the letter of credit.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.518
He cashed that very nice bond
against my advice,

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.671
made me get him the money.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.395
Ten thousand in small bills.
And when I asked him

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.279
why he wanted $10,000
in small bills, he said,

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:09.673
"Well, old man, I'm being blackmailed,
and they specified small bills. "

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.479
I know that most people
find Mark's humour charming.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.276
I do not. There is nothing charming
about running through -

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.029
Including the unpaid bill for a ring,

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.869
approximately $70,000 in one week.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.715
A $6,000 or $7,000
South Seas honeymoon,

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.838
conservatively speaking,
and a $42,000 ring.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.869
All that money spent to celebrate what?

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.474
This meager, furtive little wedding?

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.238
He didn't even ask Mother.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.114
"Pay off Strutt."

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.077
Strutt.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.352
Booze?

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.791
Shall I, uh, fix you a drink?

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.074
(Knocking)

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.433
Would you like some bourbon
to brush your teeth?

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.953
(Marnie) No, thank you.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.837
Contrary to the movies
and the Ladies Home Journal,

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.237
the battleground of marriage
is not, I repeat, not,

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.431
the... bedroom.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.193
The real field of battle is the bath.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.555
It is in the bath and for the bath,

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.631
that the lines are drawn
and no quarter given.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.990
It seems to me, we are getting off
to a dangerously poor start, darling.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:55.833
You've been in the bathroom
exactly 47 minutes.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.508
You can have the bath now.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.875
Thank you.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.630
You're very sexy
with your face clean.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.191
Marnie, come here.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.670
Sit down.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.951
I... can't! I can't! I can't!

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.559
For God's sake, Marnie!

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.719
I can't stand it! I'll die!
If you touch me again, I'll die!

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:54.828
I promise I won't touch you. Just
get out of that damn corner, please.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.994
Now, suppose you tell me
what this is all about.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.513
Is it your own little way of saying

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.352
you don't find me particularly
attractive?

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.954
I told you not to marry me.
I told you!

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.111
Oh, God, why couldn't
you have just let me go?

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:09.708
Marnie.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.833
- Don't! Please, don't!
- Let me fix you a drink.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.877
- I don't want a drink.
- A brandy -

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.156
I don't want it. Just leave me alone!

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.629
Not till I find out what's the matter,
and some way to help.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.349
The only way you can help me
is to leave me alone!

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:28.832
Can't you understand? Isn't it clear?
I cannot bear to be handled!

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.519
- By anybody? Or just me?
- You. Men.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.554
Really?

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:41.268
You didn't seem to mind
at my office that day, or at the stables.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.476
And all this last week
I've handled you.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.676
I've kissed you many times.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.557
Why didn't you break out into a cold
sweat and back into a corner then?

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:54.555
- I thought I could stand it if I had to.
- I see.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.711
Have you always felt like this?

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.553
- Always, yes!
- Why? What happened to you?

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.792
Happened? Nothing.
Nothing happened to me.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.190
I just never wanted anybody
to touch me!

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.032
You ever tried to talk about it,

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.316
to a doctor or somebody
who could help you?

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.471
No, why should I?
I didn't want to get married.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.316
It's degrading. It's animal!

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:17.392
Anyway, I was doing alright
the way I was.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.189
I wouldn't say that. If I hadn't caught
you, you'd have gone on stealing.

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:25.399
- No. No I wouldn't
- Yes, you would, again and again.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.676
Eventually, you would've
got caught by somebody.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.636
You're such a tempting little thing.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.475
Some other sexual blackmailer
would've got his hands on you.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:38.314
The chances of it being someone as
permissive as me are pretty remote.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:40.868
Sooner or later,
you'd have gone to jail.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.033
Or been cornered in an office by some
old bull of a businessman

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.316
who was out to take what he figured
was coming to him.

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:49.357
You'd probably have got him and jail.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.910
So I wouldn't say you were
doing alright, Marnie.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:56.868
- I'd say you needed help.
- I don't need your help.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.475
I don't think you're capable
of judging what you need.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.997
What you do need, I expect,
is a psychiatrist.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.709
Oh... men!

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:12.318
Say "no thanks to one", and bingo,
you're a candidate for the funny farm.

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:14.788
It would be hilarious
if it weren't pathetic.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.678
Let's try to get some rest, hm?
We'll talk this out tomorrow.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.991
There's nothing to talk out.
I've told you how I feel.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.913
I'll feel the same way tomorrow,
and the day after, and the day after that!

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.194
Alright, Marnie. We won't talk about it
until you want to.

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:34.670
But we're gonna be on this damn boat
for many days and nights.

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:38.238
Let's drop this for the present
and try to get through this

01:09:38.399 --> 01:09:40.913
bloody honeymoon cruise with
as much grace as possible.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.788
Let's try at least to be...
kind to each other.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.877
Oh. Kind!

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:50.438
Alright, if that's too much,
I'll be kind to you,

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.716
- and you'll be polite to me -
- You won't -

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.471
I won't.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.111
I give you my word.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.755
Now, let's try to get
some rest, hm? How 'bout it?

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:11.957
You in your bed over there, and me,
light years away in mine here.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.999
Thank you.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.437
I think I'd like to stay out here
for a while, but... thank you.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.753
You're gonna bring a little pazazz
down to the old farm, my dear.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.196
I noticed before we left,
Dad was pulling out his silk shirts.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.715
What do you mean,
what will I do with myself?

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.996
I had of course assumed
I would become a society hostess.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:48.073
In Africa, in Kenya, there's quite
a beautiful flower.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.038
It's coral coloured with
little green-tipped blossoms,

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.794
rather like a hyacinth.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.599
If you reach out to touch it,

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.832
you'd discover that the flower
was not a flower at all,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.676
but a design made up of hundreds
of tiny insects called Fattid bugs.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.035
They escape the eyes of hungry birds

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.998
by living and dying
in the shape of a flower.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.749
I'll close the door, if you don't mind.
The light bothers me.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.474
Hm, what's that, dear?
The light? Oh, yes, of course.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.155
You've been an absolute darling
about my sitting up reading so late.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.954
I'm boning up on marine life

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.475
since entomology doesn't seem
to be your subject,

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.712
and I 'm eager to find a subject,
Marnie, any subject.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.075
Alright. Here's a subject.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:55.268
How long? How long do we have to stay
on this boat, this trip?

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.510
How long before we can go back?

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.558
Why, Mrs Rutland!
Can you be suggesting

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.393
that these halcyon
honeymoon days and nights,

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.711
just the two of us alone
together... should ever end?

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.629
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go to bed.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:19.229
I've told you the light
from the sitting room bothers me.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.352
We certainly can't have anything
bothering you, can we?

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:23.509
(Door Slams)

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.792
If you don't want to go
to bed, please get out.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.837
But I do want to go to bed, Marnie.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.393
I very much want to go to bed.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.311
(Screams) No!

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.158
(Gasps)

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.949
I'm sorry, Marnie.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.954
(Door Closes)

01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.591
(Coughs)

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.517
Why the hell
didn't you jump over the side?

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:12.433
The idea was to kill myself,
not feed the damn fish.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.793
Mark!

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.834
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Was Fiji grisly?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.390
We didn't get to Fiji. We jumped ship
in Honolulu and flew back.

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.235
We had to take a cab from the airport.
We're tired and grimy.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.470
Remember when you were six?
You wanted to go to New York.

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.517
I warned you then that
travelling was a nasty business.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.830
You poor thing.
You must be exhausted.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.389
I think that we'll go after the
first drink and pop up to bed.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:45.632
The travel lecture will
have to wait for morning.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.950
- Where's the rest of your luggage?
- A t the airport.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:52.511
I ' ll have breakfast with you in the
morning, dad. See you then, Lil.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.477
Come on, Marnie. It's not exactly
a house of correction, you know.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.555
Look, Marnie,

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.679
for the present all we've got is the
facade, and we 've got to live it.

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:58.114
Dad has breakfast downstairs
at 8::30 every morning.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:01.431
I always join him. So, naturally,
as you want to be with me as -

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.599
This is the drill, dear.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:15.197
Wife follows husband to front door.
Gives and or gets a kiss.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.079
Stands pensively as he drives away.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.152
Oh, a wistful little wave is optional.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.037
Mark, are you... going to the office?

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.397
On the first day back after our
honeymoon? How indelicate.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.473
No, I'm going down the road
on a little errand. I'll see you later.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:47.269
Mark, I, um...
I don't have any money.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.799
I'm sorry, Marnie. I'll have Bob
make out an account for you.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:57.348
It won't be much for a while. You see,
I've had a lot of heavy expenses.

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.876
And you might as well know
I 've paid off Strutt.

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:01.792
Anonymously, of course.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.918
- (Marnie) But that's all over!
- So?

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:08.072
(Marnie) So, you've given away $10,000,

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.958
so you' re a prize fool!

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.998
Possibly, but they don't put
you in jail for being a fool.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.435
I'm not the one the cops are after.
Not yet.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.114
And I don't intend to be.
Not if I can prevent it.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.511
Perhaps you, madam, but not me.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.793
(Phone Dialling)

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.551
Hello, Mama?

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:17.513
No, I 'm alright.
I 'm perfectly alright now.

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:21.952
I had a bad case of the flu
and just didn't feel up to writing.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:25.032
I couldn't. I had laryngitis too.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.715
Yes, I am still a little hoarse.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.874
Look, Mama, I can't talk long.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:35.955
I just called to tell you that I'm
alright and I'll send some money soon.

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.793
No, I can't. I don't know when
I'll get to Baltimore.

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:42.635
But not for a few weeks anyway.
But I'll talk to you soon.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:48.193
If you need anything, write to me
at the post office box in Philadelphia.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.749
I've got to go now, Mama.

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.798
Goodbye. Goodbye, Mama.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.279
(Horn Honking)

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.118
Oh, Forio! Oh, beauty!

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.795
Well, she said she could ride a little.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.556
- Mark?
- Hm?

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.439
Mark, listen. I'm a good fighter
if you need me.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.035
I mean, if you are in
some kind of trouble.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:23.510
I have absolutely no scruples.
I'd lie to the police or anything.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.511
What on earth are you talking about?

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.357
I heard you and Marnie
this morning right out here.

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.193
- Heard?
- OK, I eavesdropped.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.879
We should've made you go to college
or come out or something.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:39.999
- I can see that now.
- Don't patronise me, Mark.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.629
That Mary-Marnie, brown-haired blonde
you married so fast and sneaky

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.711
and tried to hustle off
to the South Pacific!

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:50.396
I didn't have to overhear stuff about
your not intending to go to jail too,

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:52.357
to know that
you're in some sort of fix.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.838
- Please, Mark, will you let me help?
- Alright, you can help.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.278
You can help by being nice to Marnie.
She needs a friend.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:04.352
I always thought that a girl's
best friend was her mother.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:09.232
Poor old Mark.
Is her mother that ghastly?

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.995
When the in-laws are so grim,
you don't invite them to the wedding.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:16.835
The usual excuse is poor health
or the strain of the trip, you know?

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.230
But to claim they're dead,
now, come on!

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:23.276
Alright, Lil, what is it you're up to?
Out with it.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:27.353
Me? I'm just offering you my services.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.432
Guerrilla fighter, perjurer,
intelligence agent.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.036
- Alright, intelligence agent.
- Baltimore.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.191
There's a mother in Baltimore.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:37.998
Marnie made
a phone call this morning.

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:40.720
She said she hadn't been able to write
because she 'd had the flu.

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:44.874
She didn 't know when she 'd go to
Baltimore, but she 'd send money.

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:49.033
She said to go on writing to her
at the same post office box.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.717
I listened through the library door.

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.555
She's having you on, Lil.
It's some sort of gag.

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.029
You've been ratty. She's set out
to teach you some manners.

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.279
- You're being had, Lil.
- You can say that again!

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.955
But I don't want to say it again.
I don't want to have to say it again.

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.111
Alright, Mark.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.832
You seem to be growing up, Lil.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.953
I expect what we should do
is find you some young man.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.157
- What's your type?
- I was waiting for you.

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.950
I'm queer for liars.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.237
Really? Well, what sort
of liar do you fancy?

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.836
We could run an ad. Do you prefer
an indoor liar or an outdoor liar?

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.513
Playboy or Field and Stream?

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:45.589
Anybody home? Hi! Where's Marnie?

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:49.475
She and Dad are still out riding.
He is taking her over the hunt country.

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:52.074
Big deal! She's going
to ride with the hunt.

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.390
And Dad's throwing some kind of bash
to introduce her.

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:59.354
- Has a long-distance call come in?
- No. Not that I know of.

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.239
- (Phone Ringing)
- I'll get it.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.550
(Mark) Hello. Yes.

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.119
Hold on, I want to take it
on another phone.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.511
I ' ll take it upstairs.
Hang up as soon as I get it.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:18.229
Uh, Lil, you will hang up, won't you?

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.439
OK, Lil.

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:43.320
Hello? Yes I ' ll talk to him now.

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.877
Hello, Mr Boyle. Found anything
interesting down there?

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:50.191
Hold on. Let me get a pencil.
OK, ready.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.957
Bernice Edgar.

01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:01.036
1 1 6 Van Buren Street, Baltimore.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.599
Yeah, I got that. Go on.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.196
Wait a minute!

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.396
You say she killed him?

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.279
Well, when was that?

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:16.480
That means the little girl must've been
about five, is that right?

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.598
Well, what happened to her?
No, not the woman. The child.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.557
I want to know what happened
to the little girl, the daughter.

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.554
No, no! Stay on there.
Get me anything else you can.

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.870
Look, have photostats made
of all the court records.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.952
Send them to me immediately.
Yes, to my office. Registered.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.634
You're doing an
excellent job, Mr Boyle.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.151
(Lil) Did you have a good ride?

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.148
Yeah. Ah, Mr Boyle,
get the photostats to me. Yes.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:46.790
And call me the minute
you get anything further on the child.

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.633
Thank you.
I'll expect to hear from you.

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.836
Goodbye.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.274
(Tapping)

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:09.274
- (Tapping Continues)
- Mama? Oh, Mama, don't cry.

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.952
Please don't cry, Mama.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.109
- (Tapping)
- No! No!

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.831
Mama?

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:23.033
Mama, don't cry.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:26.275
- (Tapping Continues)
- No!

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:30.630
Mama? Mama?

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:35.189
- (Knocking At Door)
- Mama?

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:37.237
- Mama?
- Wake up, Marnie.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.913
- Mama?
- Marnie?

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:44.639
Mama? Oh, don't hurt my mama.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:49.235
- Marnie.
- Please don't hurt my mama!

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.237
- Marnie.
- (Gasps) Oh, don't, don't!

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.318
- What's going on?
- She's having a nightmare.

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:07.993
- No, Mama. Mama?
- Marnie, wake up, it's just a nightmare.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.072
- She's alright.
- I'm cold.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:21.312
That's supposed to be your department,
isn't it, ol' boy?

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.236
Good night, all.

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:42.996
- Let me get you a brandy.
- Uh-uh.

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.234
Where did you get these things?

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.194
I can get more anytime I want them.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:53.716
Yeah, of course you can. You can
also find, at your convenience,

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.872
heights, ropes, ovens,
even plastic bags.

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.110
The world's full of alternatives.

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:02.035
I'd like to go back to sleep now.

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:06.398
Why? Your sleep seems even less
agreeable than your waking hours.

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.630
That, uh, dream.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:13.190
You know, you've had it before.

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.555
Is it about something that
really happened to you?

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.633
No, I... I don't know
what it means. Nothing.

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:24.149
Well, it's about your mother.
She wants you to get up.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.076
Yes, but first there
are the three taps.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:33.793
And then she says, "Get up, Marnie.
You have to get up now!"

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:37.032
But I don't want to. If I -

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.953
If I get up, I'll be cold
and they'll hurt her!

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.240
Who? Who'll hurt her?

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:46.756
Th-Th- Them!

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.195
I don't know! I don't know!

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:52.113
But I hear the noises.
I'm cold and I hear the noises!

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:55.193
What noises? What are they like?

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.511
Who makes them?

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.595
You Freud, me Jane?

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:19.393
If you won't see an analyst,
why don't you try to help yourself?

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:24.119
But that's why I'm in this trap,
from trying to help myself.

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:26.316
Just leave me alone, Mark, please.

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:27.913
If I give you some books,
will you read them?

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:32.314
Your new homework?
Frigidity In Women?

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.994
The Psychopathic Delinquent
and Criminal?

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:38.675
- Have you read them?
- I don't need to read that muck

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:42.913
to know that women are stupid and
feeble and that men are filthy pigs!

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:50.112
In case you didn't recognise it,
that was a rejection.

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.875
I want you to read them.
Start with The Undiscovered Self.

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.669
Oh, for God's sake, Mark,
leave me alone! I'm tired!

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:02.108
Why can't you just leave me alone?

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.750
Because I think
you're sick, ol' dear.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.431
I'm sick?

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:12.959
Well, take a look
at yourself, ol' dear.

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:16.635
You're so hot to play
Mental Health Week, what about you?

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:21.954
Talk about dream worlds. You've got
a pathological fix on a woman,

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:26.159
who's not only an admitted criminal
but who screams if you come near her!

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.634
So what about your dreams, Daddy dear?

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.152
I never said I was perfect.

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:38.194
That was quite a speech.
It encourages me to believe

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.555
that you have leafed through
one or two books.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:42.836
Which one did you find
the most interesting?

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.113
You're really dying
to play doctor, aren't you?

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.993
OK, I'm a big movie fan.
I know the games.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.435
Come on. Let's play.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:59.433
Shall I start with dreams
or should we free-associate?

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.793
Oh, Doctor, I'll bet you're
just dying to free-associate.

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.758
Alright now, you give me a word
and I ' ll give you an association.

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:12.993
You know, like: needles, pins;
when a man marries, trouble begins.

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.151
You ready?

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:20.595
Well, come on! I thought you wanted
to play doctor, so let's play!

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:25.998
- Water.
- Bath. Soap. Cleanse.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:27.991
Pure. Made pure for me.

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:31.630
"And his tears
shall wash away thy sins

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:33.518
and make thee over again."

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:36.759
Baptists. Mother used to take me
to church. Twice on Sundays.

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:42.279
There. I'm not holding back
at all, am I?

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:44.749
You're bringing me out
marvellously, Doctor.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:48.799
You'll have me up on my poor paralysed
little legs by the next scene. Go on.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:53.152
- Air.
- Stare.

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.311
And that's what you do.

01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:00.475
Stare and blare and say you care,
but you're unfair, you want a pair.

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:04.233
- Sex.
- Masculine, Feminine,

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:05.674
Adam and Eve, Jack and Jill.

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:08.513
I'll slap your filthy face
if you come near me again, Jack!

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:12.832
- Death.
- Me. Oh, listen, Mark -

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.194
- Needles.
- Pins.

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:15.395
- Black
- White

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:18.114
- Red!
- White. White!

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:22.838
It's alright, Marnie.
Darling, come here.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.197
I won't let anything bad
happen to you. You're alright.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.151
- You're alright.
- Oh, help me!

01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:34.953
Help me. Oh, God,
somebody help me!

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.549
(Indistinct Chatter, Laughter)

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:55.109
(Doorbell Rings)

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:04.989
(Doorbell Rings)

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.748
(Doorbell Rings)

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.469
(Butler) What name, sir?

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.473
- Strutt.
- (Butler) Mr and Mrs Strutt.

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.871
Mr Strutt, Mrs Strutt? How do you do?

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.268
I 'm Lil Mainwaring,
Mark's sister-in-law.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:35.159
- So good of you to come all this way.
- So nice of you to ask us.

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:39.319
Wait till tomorrow, Charlie.
Wait till you see her on a horse, eh?

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:44.797
- I'm not a bit nervous, Mark.
- You have no reason to be.

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:49.079
You're unquestionably
the best-looking woman here.

01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:52.073
The best-dressed. The most intelligent.
And you're with me.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.789
- I think everyone's here.
- Well, Lil's scorekeeper.

01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:59.554
She has the list, made the table
arrangements and everything.

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.950
I'm afraid I wasn't much help,
but I'll do better next time.

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:04.076
You're doing well enough.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:08.631
I suppose we should keep... circulating.

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.191
Why?

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:20.477
- Why?
- I don't know. I swear I don't know.

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:24.118
He wasn't invited here.
He's never been invited here.

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:26.993
- It's Lil!
- Lil?

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:30.153
- She doesn't even know Strutt.
- It's Lil!

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:32.788
Get me out of here please.

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.712
It's too late. Here they come.

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.075
Look, call his bluff. I'll back you up.

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:41.390
- Oh, hello, Strutt. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:44.233
- We haven't met. I am Mark Rutland.
- How do you do?

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.675
- And this is my wife.
- How do you do?

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:49.720
Well, this is a surprise.
I hadn't heard about your marriage.

01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.792
You know, we all think
a great deal of your husband.

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:59.478
We've been doing business with
the Rutlands... for a long time.

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:08.319
- I believe we've met before.
- I don't think so.

01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:14.674
Think again... Mrs Rutland.

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.558
Are you just recently married?

01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:19.470
Marnie and I have been married
for two months.

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.835
But we've known each other
quite well for four years.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.560
Four years? Before Estelle...

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:26.079
Yes, didn't you know?

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.355
Darling, Betty seems
rather stranded over there.

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:35.239
You' ll have to excuse us for a few
moments, Mrs Strutt.

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:36.958
Oh, and Lil, would you see that

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.350
Mr and Mrs Strutt's glasses
are kept brimming?

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.669
That's a good girl.

01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:43.752
- I'm going to be sick.
- You're not going to be sick.

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.229
You said we'd known each other
four years. Lil thought -

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:49.437
I don't give one infinitesimal damn
what Lil thought or thinks.

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.999
- Dinner is ready, sir.
- Good. Announce it.

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.156
Dinner is served.

01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:00.951
Mr Strutt, my wife's taken a fancy
to you. Will you see her into dinner?

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:16.110
Five minutes! I 'm five minutes behind
you, and in those five minutes

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.748
you've got yourself up like a cat
burglar and packed for a world cruise.

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:20.992
I've got to get out of here,
and you've got to let me go.

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.469
That man is going to send me to jail.
You know he is!

01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:25.517
What are you using
for guts this season?

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.715
Don't you understand?

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.791
He's coming back here tomorrow
and he's coming for my head!

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:30.951
We just won't give it to him.

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:33.873
Strutt may be throbbing away
with vengeful fantasies,

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:37.077
but the fact is he's a businessman,
he's in the business of doing business.

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:39.310
- So?
- So we try to do business.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.311
The Rutland account
is one of the biggest he's got.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:45.268
If he insists on acting like the swine
he is, then... and he'll lose others too.

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:48.079
I'll see to it, but first I'll see to
it that he understands I'll see to it.

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.391
You can keep him from prosecuting,
you can't keep him from talking.

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.199
I don't care if he outtalks every
Southern senator on Capitol Hill.

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.509
Well, I do. I care.

01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:58.752
Darling, didn't your mother
ever tell you about sticks and stones?

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:02.708
Can't you understand there may be
other... things involved,

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:05.075
other people that I don't
want to hear about me?

01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:06.275
Yes, I can understand,

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:10.035
but since you're the well-known
orphan child, who's to care?

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.599
The police, damn you.

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:14.194
What can the police do if we can stop
Strutt from prosecuting?

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:18.313
They can start investigating
other jobs. Other similar jobs.

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:25.836
- Well, that's something else again.
- Yes, it is.

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.550
How many? How many other jobs?

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.120
Tell me the truth, damn it! You've
nothing to gain by lying to me now!

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.316
- How many jobs have you pulled?
- Three.

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:41.749
- Try again.
- Four. Five counting Strutt.

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:44.477
Over how long a period?

01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:46.631
Five years,
and that's the truth, I swear!

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:51.554
- Alright. How much? How much?
- Under $50,000.

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:54.079
What towns?

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:57.277
Buffalo, Detroit, Elizabeth, New Jersey
and New York.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.749
Well, in New York and Philadelphia,

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.559
I ' ll be poor old Mark Rutland who lost
his head over a pretty girl.

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:05.234
In the others I'm just
an accessory after the fact

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:06.992
and equally liable under the law.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.833
Well, then let me go! They can't
blame you because you didn't know!

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.912
After you found out, I ran away.
Just let me go!

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.150
If I let you run out now,
nothing could keep the lid on it.

01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:18.517
They've got your real name. They'll
work up a complete dossier on you.

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:20.079
When they finally catch you,
and they will catch you,

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.912
they'll throw the
New York City Library at you.

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:25.314
But, suppose we don't lose our heads?

01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:28.995
All we've got to fight is Strutt's
big mouth. That gives us time.

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:33.037
Sit down. Listen.
We can do one of two things.

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.033
We can hire a lawyer
and a psychiatrist,

01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:39.590
and make an immediate voluntary
confession and an offer of restitution.

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:40.954
That'll make the whole thing public.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:44.910
But the chances are very good
that you' ll get a suspended sentence.

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.150
Now the alternative.

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:50.198
We can go together and make private
calls on all the places you've robbed.

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:54.719
You'll express deep sorrow
and repentance,

01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.359
sincere and vocal contrition.

01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:59.552
And while you sob, I show a check
for the amount stolen.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:02.394
Press it into their hands

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:05.120
and ask as a special favour
to a distraught husband,

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.589
to withdraw the charge.
But if one of them says,

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:09.751
"Thanks, I'll take the money,
but I won't drop the charge, "

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:10.909
then we 've had it.

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.034
After that it's an open court case,
and very probable sentence.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.878
On the other hand, with a bit of luck
we might pull it off.

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.951
Think it over.

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:25.389
It's late. You better get some sleep.
You gotta be up for the hunt.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.915
You don't expect me
to ride in the hunt!

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:29.559
Certainly I expect you to ride.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:32.280
For one thing, I want you out of
the house when Strutt comes here.

01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:34.358
For another, I don't want
to give Lil the satisfaction

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:35.953
of seeing you chicken.

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:40.394
And, Marnie,
tonight the door stays open.

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.838
(Dogs Barking)

01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.430
(Indistinct Chatter, Laughter)

01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:05.994
(Screams)

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:09.589
(Whinnies)

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:12.232
(Screams)

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.830
Forio!

01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.271
(Whinnies)

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:58.154
A gun! Give me a gun!
My horse is screaming!

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:01.596
- Get me a gun!
- You want to shoot your horse?

01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:03.990
Hey, wait a minute!

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:08.438
I can't give you a gun, my mister
isn't home. I don't know what he'd -

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:11.034
You must be crazy!

01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:13.668
Mrs Turpin!

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:16.479
Miss Mainwaring,
this woman comes tearing in here

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:17.993
demandin' I give her a gun.

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:21.391
Tell this fool to give me a gun.
Forio 's hurt!

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:25.155
Marnie, wait. I ' ll call a vet.
There's nothing a vet can do.

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:27.470
We don't have a phone
anyway, Miss Mainwaring.

01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:30.871
If the horse is hurt bad,
I could give her Jack's pistol.

01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:33.235
Hurry. Oh, hurry, please.
He's suffering.

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.231
Go get the gun!

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:37.595
I'll do it, Marnie. You wait here.

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:40.149
Are you still in the mood for killing?

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:43.912
Please, Marnie!

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:46.833
Stay out of my way!

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.116
Marnie, please!

01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.554
If you don't want me to do it,

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:56.234
then let me go back
for one of the men.

01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.470
(Whinnies)

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:16.039
There.

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:18.350
There now.

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:28.230
So you can see, Mr Strutt,
how very disadvantageous,

01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:31.233
any action on your part
would be for everyone.

01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:34.474
For me, certainly.

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:37.313
For a sick girl... and for you.

01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:41.078
Yes, I 'm sure that's the fashionable
attitude, Mr Rutland.

01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:44.312
But just wait until
you've been victimised.

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:55.158
(Mark) Try to look at the situation
from a business point of view.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:57.276
(Strutt) Yes.

01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:02.309
(Mark) We 've been business friends
for a number of years now.

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:04.550
(Continues Indistinct)

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:06.949
(Mark) I want you to apply
them all for my benefit.

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.031
(Strutt) Hm.

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:15.759
- (Phone Ringing)
- Oh, sorry.

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:17.797
Hello.

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:20.110
Yes, Lil, what is it?

01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:26.354
Yes, I understand.
I 'm hanging up now.

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:30.115
You' ll have to forgive me, I 've had
a bit of trouble at the hunt.

01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:34.159
I'll talk to you again, possibly
tomorrow. I'm sorry to run out.

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:03.715
(Mark)
I'll take you home, Marnie.

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:11.190
It's alright, darling.

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:19.115
You're just exhausted.
Now, don't panic.

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:26.032
I've spoken to Strutt. I think
I'll be able to talk him around.

01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:37.750
I'll just put this away.

01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:05.348
Go on. You want the money.

01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:08.034
You wanted the money, or you wouldn't
have taken my keys, would you?

01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:10.191
You took the keys,
now take the money!

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:12.351
I said take it!

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:19.871
What's mine belongs to you.
It's yours!

01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:21.871
You're not stealing.

01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:24.634
You want the money, take it.
I said take it!

01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:47.715
Marnie, now we're going to
Baltimore to see your mother.

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:50.348
- No!
- Yes.

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:06.150
Come on.

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:14.790
So, I knew you'd run away,
and you'd want money.

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:18.236
It didn't take me a minute to find out
the office drawer key was gone.

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:23.912
If you tell my mother about me,
I'll kill you.

01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:27.111
If you mean about the robberies,

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.999
I've no intention
of telling her anything.

01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:33.197
It's your mother who's
going to do the talking.

01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:37.470
(Thunderclaps)

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.468
Marnie, come on.

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.551
- No!
- Come on.

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:06.876
- It's alright, Marnie. You're inside.
- (Mama) What in the wide world -

01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:09.395
I'm sorry to crash in
on you like this, Mrs Edgar.

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:12.950
I guess you know
how Marnie feels about storms.

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:16.351
Marnie, stop acting like
such a ninny.

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:19.239
Who are you, mister?
You're not Mr Pendleton.

01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:21.277
No, I 'm not.
Who 's Mr Pendleton?

01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:23.874
Then what have you got to do
with my Marnie?

01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:26.554
I'm Mark Rutland,
Marnie's husband, Mrs Edgar.

01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:28.472
Marnie hasn't been very well.

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:31.108
I don't believe she 's been well
since your accident.

01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:32.269
My what?

01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:34.237
I think you've always
called it "your accident."

01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:37.392
What do you think
you' re talking about?

01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:40.791
Comin' into my house like this,
talking about my accident!

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:44.753
You're not married to Marnie.
I don't believe you.

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:48.071
- Marnie?
- Your daughter needs help, Mrs Edgar.

01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.832
You've got to tell her the truth.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.070
She has no memory
of what happened that night.

01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:56.313
And she needs to remember everything!
You must help her.

01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:58.994
Mister, you must be plumb crazy.

01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:02.550
If you won't tell her, I will.
I know everything that happened.

01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:05.439
- I'll tell her the whole story.
- Oh, no you won't,

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:09.229
because you don't know the whole story,
and nobody does but me!

01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:13.668
Oh. Well, since you're so very
knowledgeable, Mrs Edgar,

01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:14.989
do you also know that your daughter,

01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:17.276
your beautiful, young daughter,

01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:19.431
cannot stand to have a man
touch her? Any man?

01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.550
She doesn't know why, but you do.

01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:25.469
Don't you think you owe it to her to
help her to understand what happened

01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:27.551
- to make her like this?
- What matters what made her?

01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:31.190
She's lucky to feel like that!
Just plain lucky!

01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:34.909
That's very interesting, Mrs Edgar.

01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:37.071
But I've had
an investigator working here.

01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:39.390
I 've read the transcript. Hm?

01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:41.710
The records of your trial for murder.

01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:43.757
In the records
it states quite plainly

01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:46.036
that you made your
living from the touch of men.

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:51.069
It was one of your clients that
you killed that night.

01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.959
Oh, God!

01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:56.111
Was there also a storm
that night, Mrs Edgar?

01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:58.236
Is that why Marnie's
terrified of storms?

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:00.675
Was there thunder
and lightning that night?

01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:02.910
Did the storms terrify
your little girl,

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:04.593
in addition to everything
else that happened?

01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:07.877
Get out of my house.

01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:10.474
You get out!

01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:13.359
I don't need any filthy man
comin' in my house no more!

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:15.158
Do you hear me? You get out!

01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:19.432
You get out of my house! (Screaming)

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.670
You get out!

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.797
You let my mama go!

01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:28.714
You hear? You let my mama go!

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:32.555
- You're hurtin' my mama!
- Who am I, Marnie?

01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:37.430
- Why should I want to hurt your mama?
- You' re one of them.

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:42.077
- One of them in the white suits.
- Shut up, Marnie!

01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:47.030
No! Remember, Marnie.
Tell us how it all was.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.560
The white suits! Remember?

01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:56.398
(Tapping)

01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:58.835
What does the tapping mean, Marnie?

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.036
Why does it make you cry?

01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:05.318
It means... they want in.

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:08.870
Them in their white suits.

01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:13.033
Mama comes and gets me out of bed.

01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:15.634
I don't like to get out of bed.

01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:36.670
Come on, Marnie.

01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:39.798
Get up. Alright?

01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:42.918
Good girl.

01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:45.992
That's my baby.

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.549
There.

01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:53.714
There. Mm.

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:57.475
- You go on back to sleep, sugarpop.
- Bernice.

01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:06.397
- (Thunderclap)
- (Sobbing)

01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:16.271
Now, you ain't afraid of a little bit
of lightning, are you? Huh?

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:21.115
What happens next, Marnie?

01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:26.428
He - He come out... to me.

01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:32.674
Oh, I don't like him.
He - He smells funny.

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:35.718
Your old captain's gonna be here
all through the night.

01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:37.199
There's no reason to cry.

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:39.078
I want my mama!

01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:44.394
I don't want you! Let me go! Mama!

01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:46.676
(Sobbing)

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:50.116
Get your damn hands off my kid!

01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:53.192
What are you trying to -
What are you -

01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:59.238
Mama?

01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:02.790
Make him go, Mama.

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:06.350
I don't like him to kiss me.
Make him go, Mama!

01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:08.715
(Marnie Screams)

01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:11.792
Get your hands - Get your hands -

01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:14.952
There's nothing the matter
with my hands!

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:19.154
(Mark) What is it, Marnie?
What's the matter?

01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.878
He hit my mama!

01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:24.430
No! No! What's the matter with you?
You crazy or drunk?

01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:28.229
Now, don't go hittin' me.
You're gonna get hit yourself.

01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:36.555
- (Screams)
- Oh, my leg!

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:38.597
- Mama?
- Is your mother hurt?

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:43.436
- How? How is she hurt?
- He fell on her.

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:46.398
Oh, she's so hurt! Oh, Mama.

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:49.677
Marnie! Marnie, help me!

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.873
I got to help my mama!

01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.996
(Sobbing)

01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:02.711
Marnie?

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:06.708
I hit him!

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:10.839
I hit him with a stick. I - I hurt him!

01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:22.195
There. There now.

01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:27.515
- (Screams, Sobs)
- (Screams)

01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:40.711
You're alright now, darling.
You're alright.

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:43.599
It's all over.

01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:45.637
You're alright.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.515
I thought when she lost
her memory of that night,

01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:12.955
it was a sign of God's forgiveness.

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:16.396
I thought I was being
given another chance

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:19.438
to change everything,

01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:21.716
to make it all up to her.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.789
I 'm sorry, Mrs Edgar.

01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:27.599
Truly sorry.

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:31.435
Your mother told the police that she'd
killed the sailor in self-defense.

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:35.479
They could see how bad hurt I was.
They believed me.

01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:39.758
And I never told anyone the truth.

01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:41.717
Never.

01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:44.394
Not even when they tried to take you
away from me, Marnie.

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:47.393
Not even then.

01:59:48.680 --> 01:59:53.231
You must've loved me, Mama.
You must've loved me!

01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:59.715
You're the only thing in
this world I ever did love.

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:09.590
It - it was just that
I was so young, Marnie.

02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:13.879
I never had anything of my own.

02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:21.716
You know how I got you, Marnie?

02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:29.314
There was this boy.

02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:31.789
Billy.

02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:36.238
And I wanted Billy's
basketball sweater.

02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:40.073
I was 15.

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:44.193
And Billy said, if I let him,

02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:46.920
I could have the sweater.

02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:50.151
So I let him.

02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:57.679
And then, later on when you got
started, he run away.

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:03.997
I still got that old sweater.

02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:07.632
And I got you, Marnie.

02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:15.236
And after the accident,
when I was in the hospital,

02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:18.153
they tried to make me
let you be adopted.

02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:20.595
But I wouldn't.

02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:22.557
I wanted you.

02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:25.029
And I promised God right then,

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:29.591
if he'd let me keep you,
and you not remember,

02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:33.196
I'd bring you up different from me.

02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:35.396
Decent.

02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:38.313
Decent?

02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:41.040
Oh, Mama!

02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:45.189
Well, you surely realised
your ambition.

02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:48.636
I certainly am decent.

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.150
Of course I'm a cheat,

02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:55.312
and a liar and a thief,

02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:58.316
but I am decent.

02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:04.995
Marnie, it's time to have a
little compassion for yourself.

02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:07.549
When a child,

02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:11.679
a child of any age, Marnie,
can't get love,

02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:15.196
it takes what it can get,
any way it can get it.

02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:18.318
It's not so hard to understand.

02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:34.955
Get up, Marnie, you' re aching my leg.

02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:54.630
There. That's better.

02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:58.550
Mark?

02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:02.630
Wha - What am I going to do?

02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:05.917
What's going to happen?

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:08.594
What do you want to happen?

02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:13.992
I guess I... I want it all cleared up.

02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:15.752
Will I -

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.798
Will I go to jail?

02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:24.035
No. Not after what
I have to tell them.

02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:32.231
We'll go now.

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:42.153
Ah, Mrs Edgar, I'll bring Marnie back.

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:45.118
She's very tired now.

02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:48.311
Goodbye, Mama.

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:52.151
Goodbye.

02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:59.791
Goodbye, sugarpop.

02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:15.595
Oh, Mark,

02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:17.990
I don't want to go to jail.

02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:19.912
I'd rather stay with you.

02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:22.514
Had you, love?

02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:25.399
(Girls) # Send for the doctor
over the hill.

02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:28.233
# Call for the doctor.
Call for the nurse.

02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:31.312
# Call for the lady
with the alligator purse.
