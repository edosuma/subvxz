With publication in 1949
of her seminal text,

31:43.069 --> 31:45.988
"The Second Sex,"
Simone de Beauvoir

31:45.988 --> 31:48.365
redefined the semiotics
of femininity

31:48.365 --> 31:50.326
throughout the western world.

31:50.326 --> 31:52.786
What has not been explored
is the relationship

31:52.786 --> 31:56.832
between her loss of faith and
subsequent revolutionary views.

31:56.832 --> 32:00.586
Sister Lillian Marie Montreau
was a nun at the convent school

32:00.586 --> 32:03.630
that de Beauvoir attended,
and it was Montreau

32:03.630 --> 32:06.092
who helped Simone grapple
with the theories that--

32:06.092 --> 32:08.093
- I'm sorry.
- [Helene] Yes?

Are you saying Montreau
was a formative influence?

from de Beauvoir, yes,

We don't have any surviving

32:22.150 --> 32:25.153
We--we do have letters.

32:30.491 --> 32:32.451
We have them at Loyola.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.411

to be an asshole here.

32:53.055 --> 32:55.015
- Yes.
- It's in the letters.

32:55.015 --> 32:57.142
Montreau had
a very narrow world view,

32:57.142 --> 32:58.811
specifically regarding
acceptance

32:58.811 --> 33:00.437
of patriarchal realities.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.147
Really?

33:02.147 --> 33:04.983
If anything, the reconceived
semiotics of "The Second Sex"

33:04.983 --> 33:08.029
were formulated later,
in opposition to a colleague
