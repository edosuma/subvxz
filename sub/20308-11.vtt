WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:05.088
(indistinct chatter)

00:06.881 --> 00:07.716
Item eight.

00:08.758 --> 00:11.553
Uh, thanks to the continuing spell
of warm weather,

00:11.636 --> 00:14.472
loving couples have returned
to that cozy row

00:14.556 --> 00:17.851
of park benches hidden away
between Egan and St. Claire.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.604
Bringing, as a result
of their unseasonable passion,

00:21.688 --> 00:25.692
the return of the St. Claire snatcher,
who eluded us all summer.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.445
Six purses have recently been grabbed.

00:28.737 --> 00:33.992
Detective Belker, Officer Russo
are therefore assigned undercover.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.705
Item nine, ongoing surveillance.

00:39.122 --> 00:42.625
Detective Natkin and Fuller
on the Edgewood investigation,

00:42.709 --> 00:44.919
and Detectives LaRue and Washington

00:45.003 --> 00:47.547
have been double-shifting
since 2100 hours last evening,

00:47.630 --> 00:50.133
on the reported arsonist
Joseph Scornavaco.

00:50.675 --> 00:54.262
Uniform personnel,
would you please check the duty board

00:54.345 --> 00:55.680
for your backup assignments?

00:55.764 --> 00:57.599
And I think that just about handles it.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.392
Excuse me, Sarge, I got an--

00:59.476 --> 01:02.937
-HOWARD: Officer Flaherty.
-Some creep yesterday

01:03.021 --> 01:06.316
stole my tape deck
out of my car over on Herman.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.942
Report it, Officer, let's go, now.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.778
You know, one of the ones
you pull right out?

01:09.861 --> 01:11.362
Well, why didn't you pull it out?

01:11.863 --> 01:12.739
Is that the point?

01:13.156 --> 01:15.283
I'm a cop, right,
are we gonna get behind this?

01:15.366 --> 01:17.118
File a 642, man.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.246
I filed, I filed, I'm saying,
we're gonna give 'em hell on this.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.707
Okay, Patrick, they get the message,

01:22.791 --> 01:24.876
let's go, okay, come on.

01:29.047 --> 01:33.093
-Ah, Mr. Scornavaco, I presume?
-One busted arsonist, Sarge.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.302
I would like a lawyer immediately.

01:34.385 --> 01:36.096
-I got whiplash.
-Come on.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.307
Unit's bucking worse than ever, Sarge.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.684
Stalled on us twice on the way in.
Gotta have something better.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.854
Ah, Judas. Lee, get us a unit over there.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.819
Here we go, ND-12, Detective.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.987
-Hey, thanks, Sarge.
-Whatever happened to team spirit?

01:53.071 --> 01:54.989
I mean, that tape cassette wasn't cheap.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.574
Lee, where's Raymond?

01:56.658 --> 01:58.243
-Lieutenant Goldblume?
-Good morning.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.995
Sharon Fein, new member
of the PDs Department.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.623
She just spent two months in rotation
out in Farmingdale.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.542
Welcome to the Hill, Miss Fein.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.043
-We'll try to keep you busy.
-Thanks, Lieutenant,

02:07.127 --> 02:08.294
I'm looking forward to it.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.673
Oh, my.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.008
Gotta be a new PD, Neal.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.011
Hey, hey, hey, come on, lover.
Let's get this guy down to holding.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.973
Please, God, let her take this case.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.184
(shouting indistinct)

02:28.940 --> 02:31.067
It ain't Easter, all right, come on!

02:33.278 --> 02:35.405
-PCP?
-Maybe.

02:36.072 --> 02:41.452
Sergeant Hunter assigns cases,
the interrogation room--

02:41.536 --> 02:43.371
(shouting)

02:50.628 --> 02:53.298
Is this, um, is it usually so...

02:53.590 --> 02:56.885
Yeah, well, it can get pretty rough,
but you'll get used to it.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.387
You'll see when a day starts like this--

02:59.470 --> 03:01.514
Ow! My finger, ow!

03:02.348 --> 03:03.975
They usually end up quite calm.

03:04.058 --> 03:06.895
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:06.978 --> 03:08.771
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:08.855 --> 03:12.692
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:12.775 --> 03:14.235
(sirens wailing)

03:19.991 --> 03:22.994
(theme music playing)

05:29.704 --> 05:32.373
Ah, Counselor, Ricardo Diaz,

05:32.457 --> 05:35.543
burglary, controlled substance,
Interrogation A.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.586
Thank you, Sergeant.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.630
Sarge, on that undercover with Tina Russo,

05:39.714 --> 05:41.924
now look, I got nothing
against her personally--

05:42.008 --> 05:44.344
I know that you prefer
to work solo, Detective,

05:44.427 --> 05:46.637
but I need a couple undercover.

05:46.721 --> 05:50.975
Okay, you remember I mentioned to you
I had a couple of personal things?

05:51.059 --> 05:53.728
All right, duly noted,
work it out with Officer Russo.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.067
Hey, Mick,
are you still looking for a vehicle?

05:59.150 --> 06:00.902
I'm going down this afternoon
to look at one.

06:00.985 --> 06:03.905
Just hold the phone, my friend.
You know my brother-in-law Rob's lot?

06:03.988 --> 06:07.075
He calls me up, says,
do I know a guy who'd like a favor?

06:07.158 --> 06:09.535
Beware of brothers-in-law with deals.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.872
Funny. '83 Dodge Diplomat, one owner.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.833
If you take it without the bodywork,
it's $250 over his cost.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.378
-What bodywork?
-A couple dimples, nothing.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.506
Hey, if he hammers them out,
the price goes up 800, 900.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.386
Hey, call him up yourself,
huh, I'm not selling it.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.014
-Oh.
-Excuse me.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.517
Uh, no, no problem.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.144
-Uh, Detective LaRue?
-Yes, ma'am, and you're?

06:35.228 --> 06:37.355
Uh, I'm Sharon Fein, the new PD here.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.148
It's a pleasure, Sharon.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.360
Um, I'll be representing
Joseph Scornavaco.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.446
Heavy duty case, that, very complicated.

06:46.906 --> 06:51.411
Look, I don't normally offer,
but since you're new,

06:51.494 --> 06:56.207
if you want a pre-interrogation session
to go over pertinent details,

06:57.250 --> 06:58.584
I'll make myself available.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.754
Uh, thank you, Detective,
but for the moment,

07:01.838 --> 07:04.424
all I'll need are your summons
and your AA-16s.

07:04.799 --> 07:05.716
Yeah, yeah.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.138
(mouthing) Thank you.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.640
Seven priors, no resisting.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.601
I didn't break in to that store.
That's period.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.312
But you were caught hiding in a Dumpster
behind the gun shop.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.399
I was waiting for my girlfriend
to come down there, all right?

07:21.482 --> 07:24.277
The police found
burglars' tools in the Dumpster,

07:24.527 --> 07:27.280
and half a gram of cocaine
in your back pocket.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.783
I know these may seem
like, uh, petty charges to you, Mr. Diaz,

07:30.867 --> 07:32.660
but you're facing a parole violation

07:32.743 --> 07:34.912
that could send you back to prison
for six years.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.666
If you want me to help you,
you've got to trust me with some facts.

07:39.667 --> 07:40.668
I got facts.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.170
Good.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.756
Let's start with the night of your arrest.
Uh, where--

07:45.840 --> 07:47.467
I got some facts they want to know about.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.843
-Who?
-The police, man,

07:48.926 --> 07:50.678
-I've got some heavy facts.
-Such as?

07:50.761 --> 07:53.139
Such as, you know,
there are certain politicians

07:53.973 --> 07:55.349
with storefronts up here.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.520
Well, one of them
made some bad enemies, man, real bad.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.147
-What do you mean?
-Blam,

08:01.689 --> 08:04.358
they're going to blow his place
straight to hell tonight.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.777
Could you tell me a little more?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.030
I tell you more, I got nothing to deal.

08:09.113 --> 08:10.740
This is privileged, Mr. Diaz,

08:11.115 --> 08:12.783
they won't find out
anything that hurts you,

08:12.867 --> 08:14.827
but I need enough to be credible.

08:14.911 --> 08:18.498
I am not spending
a six pack in the hole, man!

08:19.165 --> 08:21.792
Do you understand attorney-client
privilege, Mr. Diaz?

08:29.759 --> 08:35.264
It's Miguelez, San Juan Libre,
against the Garfield guy.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.016
Okay?

08:38.226 --> 08:40.561
I boosted the dynamite for Miguelez...

08:42.063 --> 08:43.064
a couple of weeks ago.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.024
Let me talk to the captain.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.527
I think we can do something with this.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.284
And so...

08:55.826 --> 08:57.787
Assault two, gentlemen,
eyewitness at this address,

08:57.870 --> 09:00.581
victim at Mercy, you can stop by
and take his statement.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.417
-Oh, I love cleaning up after night shift.
-Uh-huh.

09:03.501 --> 09:04.961
I'm out about an hour.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.297
No, I can't totally vouch for him,

09:08.381 --> 09:10.424
-but it sounds real.
-Tell me more.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.760
I've already told you
enough to bring in the DA.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.805
How does a low rent thief like Diaz
get involved in bombings?

09:15.888 --> 09:17.974
Attorney-client privilege, Furillo.

09:19.016 --> 09:21.143
-What does your client want?
-The narcotics dropped,

09:21.227 --> 09:23.312
the burglary down to an "A" misdemeanor,

09:23.396 --> 09:25.690
six months max, no parole violation.

09:25.773 --> 09:28.526
Sweet deal considering his prints
are inside the gun shop door.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.778
I'd say you get the better half
of the exchange.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.905
Tell me one thing,
is the planned attack political?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.865
Or animal, vegetable, or mineral?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.493
Come on, Frank, call Irwin, time's short.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.416
Raymond, see if you can raise
ADA Bernstein for me.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.419
-Guess this is the end of the heat wave.
-Yeah.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.089
(sighs) Maybe nothing's happening...

09:51.132 --> 09:52.842
because we don't look involved enough.

09:54.927 --> 09:58.139
This guy steals people's purses
when they're kissing, so, maybe--

09:58.222 --> 09:59.932
I think we look pretty convincing.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.310
Mick, it's only an assignment.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.644
Do you really think it's necessary?

10:03.728 --> 10:05.938
Look, you're the one
who told me about undercover.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.066
-You wanna be here till spring?
-No.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.363
All right, I'm shutting my eyes
and pretending you're Robin.

10:14.989 --> 10:15.823
Me too.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.828
Um...

10:21.078 --> 10:23.914
and now remember,
I've got to check Rob Nelson's car.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.834
Okay, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.629
I'm very sorry,
it was the only appointment I could get.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.553
(sighs)

10:39.138 --> 10:42.141
Eight dollars,
that was all that was in my wallet.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.561
Mr. Hopkins,
you say a large Black man assaulted you?

10:45.936 --> 10:47.647
Six feet, more maybe.

10:47.730 --> 10:51.525
Mr. Hopkins, we just talked
to an eyewitness, a Ms. Baker,

10:51.609 --> 10:54.779
who said she saw your neighbor
Danny Lopez beat you up.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.864
RENKO: So why don't you
tell us the truth, sir?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.200
I told her, no police.

10:59.283 --> 11:02.620
We're going to have to check this out
whether you help us or not, Mr. Hopkins.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.330
Was it Danny Lopez?

11:05.915 --> 11:07.875
He's 18 years old.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.420
His little sister Elena is only 11.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.882
Their-their grandmother
was all they had.

11:14.965 --> 11:17.259
When she died last month, I promised...

11:19.845 --> 11:22.807
(sniffles)
Don't bring Danny in, he's a good boy.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.142
There's no one else
to take care of her but him.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.561
So why did he assault you?

11:27.645 --> 11:28.979
Something happened.

11:29.730 --> 11:33.818
I was with, I came, I...

11:34.485 --> 11:37.405
Like I always do,
I checked on the little girl,

11:37.488 --> 11:39.198
while he was at work, and Danny...

11:41.117 --> 11:41.951
I can't.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.874
All right, all right, Mr. Hopkins.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.460
Just tell me what happened.

11:52.753 --> 11:53.713
He was...

11:56.549 --> 11:58.342
with his sister.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.345
You know how I mean?

12:02.054 --> 12:04.306
His beautiful little sister.

12:05.141 --> 12:09.645
I know, I saw them, he beat me,
that was why, because of her.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.992
Blue Book value on this baby is--
You don't even want to know the Blue Book.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.493
Actually, I'd like to see it.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.454
Well, when we get back, no problemo.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.165
Now the way this works
as I explained to J.D. here,

12:29.248 --> 12:33.627
let's say I get, uh,
an overload of, uh, late model sedans,

12:33.711 --> 12:35.671
I get an '83 Dodge,
I pass it right on through.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.047
That's a pretty sweet deal.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.592
Hey, you guys always treated me real good.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.511
Whew! It's a bit toasty in here, isn't it?

12:45.139 --> 12:47.641
(laughs) A little Crazy Glue.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.435
The steering is funny.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.188
Oh? You ever drive
power steering before, Detective?

12:52.271 --> 12:53.272
Oh, I drive it.

12:54.523 --> 12:55.649
Ah, it's a little shimmy.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.235
Take it to a brake shop,
they'll charge you $40 to fix it.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.945
-If it gotta take care of it--
-Yeah, I know,

13:00.029 --> 13:02.281
the price goes up 800, 900.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.658
MAN:
Just stay right there, you won't get hurt.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.244
What's the-- what's the problem?

13:07.328 --> 13:08.454
It's a robbery.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.040
Oh, a little excitement.

13:11.123 --> 13:14.126
Well, I guess it's time
to snap on the old seatbelt.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.550
Uh, whoa, hey, Detective,

13:22.134 --> 13:25.429
don't you think maybe we-we could call
this one in, huh? How about it?

13:25.513 --> 13:27.306
On what, you got a radio in here?

13:27.389 --> 13:30.810
No, but look,
let's wait a minute here, okay--

13:35.648 --> 13:37.399
(tires screeching)

13:38.818 --> 13:40.152
(car honks)

13:43.948 --> 13:46.200
I'll tell you, this car,
just came on the lot today,

13:46.283 --> 13:48.118
there's no insurance on this car.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.665
You understand, there's no insurance!

13:53.374 --> 13:54.625
(tires screech)

14:01.882 --> 14:03.968
(clamoring)

14:08.597 --> 14:09.473
(growls)

14:09.557 --> 14:12.351
MAN (over PA):
<i>Next train southbound, seven minutes.</i>

14:13.310 --> 14:17.273
Now, Raymond, would you deliver Mr. Diaz
back to holding, please?

14:17.356 --> 14:18.190
Yes, sir.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.154
Let's go, Miguelez.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.366
You dropped some change on me, Diaz?

14:28.033 --> 14:29.034
No way, man.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.036
Get Señor Miguelez
down to garden level, all right?

14:31.120 --> 14:34.415
You're over, Ricky,
you're done, you got it? Scum!

14:34.748 --> 14:37.167
Will somebody get my attorney, please?

14:38.002 --> 14:40.170
Would somebody get that lying bitch?

14:47.970 --> 14:49.930
You sold out my client, you sold me out.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.974
I didn't sell out anyone, Counselor.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.726
As of this moment, I don't know

14:53.809 --> 14:55.311
-how we got to Miguelez.
-You don't know?

14:55.394 --> 14:57.771
Forty minutes after our conversation,
you've got him in custody.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.398
I call that a hell of a coincidence.

14:59.481 --> 15:02.693
I'll find out what happened,
but I'll guarantee you what didn't happen

15:02.776 --> 15:05.195
is I didn't go to Buntz
and tell him to pick up somebody

15:05.279 --> 15:08.032
based on an unconfirmed report
from your client.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.658
Besides, you never mentioned Miguelez.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.994
I didn't have to.
You or Daniels' red squad

15:12.077 --> 15:13.329
or somebody figured it out.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.955
Without any help from me.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.373
You're right,
it sounds like the red squad.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.125
Buntz is precinct liaison.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.837
Look, just give my client his deal.
You got what you wanted.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.381
Pardon me, but I don't see
a basis for negotiation.

15:25.049 --> 15:25.883
You don't?

15:26.634 --> 15:29.261
Mr. Diaz had information
on a major league bust

15:29.345 --> 15:30.804
which I passed on to you.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.640
You know I can't sell that to Bernstein,

15:32.723 --> 15:35.392
not on a career criminal,
not on a parole violator.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.436
And what am I supposed to tell my client?

15:37.895 --> 15:38.854
"Sorry?"

15:42.900 --> 15:45.986
Sergeant, I'd like to see Mr. Diaz
in interrogation, please.

15:46.487 --> 15:47.321
All right.

15:47.655 --> 15:48.614
Howard, where's Norman?

15:48.697 --> 15:50.783
Um, downtown for a search warrant,
I believe.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.534
Send him in as soon as he gets back.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.165
And I tell you,
I tell you the car is uninsured,

15:58.248 --> 16:01.001
but you got to go playing cops and robbers
with another man's chattel.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.920
And then to top it off,
you don't even catch the guy.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.089
Oh, I love it, this is perfect,
really perfect.

16:05.756 --> 16:09.009
I smashed up a private citizen's car
chasing a perp.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.052
-Anyone hurt?
-No.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.887
Now you don't know that,
you don't know how my neck feels.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.514
I'll call city services,
they'll send a medic.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.933
-Thank you.
-Oh, great, another day of bureaucracy.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.685
I was doing you a favor, pal.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.523
I still need those A-16s, Detective.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.566
Well, paperwork takes time, Sharon.

16:25.734 --> 16:26.694
You know, if you'd like,

16:26.777 --> 16:29.905
I could summarize
the information for you orally.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.740
-(chuckles)
-J.D., we've got to talk.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.200
-Excuse us.
-I'll be right back.

16:38.747 --> 16:41.375
Do you think I could get those A-16s
off of you, Detective?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.627
-J.D.: What do you want?
-ROB: Come on, the guy wrecked the car,

16:43.711 --> 16:44.545
our deal's off, John.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.006
Hey, that's not my problem,
I still get paid, don't I?

16:47.339 --> 16:48.674
You still want a finder's fee?

16:48.757 --> 16:51.677
Hey would you dial it down,
the moral outrage, Rob?

16:51.760 --> 16:54.138
I provided you with one customer,
per advertised.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.889
The idiot wrecked the car!

16:55.973 --> 16:57.933
The idiot gave you the keys
to a gold mine.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.228
You collect from the city, you get the car
out of the junkyard and you sell it again.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.438
Don't tell me how to do business, John.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.314
Oh, you're telling me
that's not your intentions?

17:04.398 --> 17:07.484
You're telling me I don't deserve
20 percent of all settlements?

17:07.568 --> 17:08.902
Eat dogmeat, J.D.!

17:10.612 --> 17:13.157
I told you, I ain't talking to you.
I want a new lawyer!

17:14.908 --> 17:16.702
I share your anger, Mr. Diaz.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.038
But a new lawyer
won't change your situation.

17:19.121 --> 17:22.374
You went and told your old man everything!

17:23.125 --> 17:24.752
Yeah, you don't think I know the score?

17:25.586 --> 17:28.505
Guy in the pen told me,
you're married to the captain.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.840
That has nothing to do with this.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.051
I ask for a lawyer,
they give me Mrs. Captain!

17:32.134 --> 17:34.762
If Captain Furillo is to blame,
we'll go after him in court.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.847
That's a lie, you sold my ticket!

17:36.930 --> 17:39.683
I'm going to jail,
and Jorge's people gonna stick me!

17:39.767 --> 17:41.518
I'm angry too,
and I want to find out what happened

17:41.602 --> 17:42.936
as badly as you do. Let me help.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.272
Forget about it, lady, you're history.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.485
I'll get somebody else
to help me buy my ticket back.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.340
My brother's not here.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.217
Are you Elena Lopez?

18:14.551 --> 18:17.221
We're police officers.
May we come in and talk to you?

18:17.721 --> 18:19.098
Danny said not to let anybody in.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.558
That's real good advice,

18:21.892 --> 18:23.727
that's the same advice
I give my little girl.

18:23.811 --> 18:24.728
How old is she?

18:24.812 --> 18:26.563
Oh, she's just a little girl,
just two years old.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.982
Can we come in for a minute?
It's real important.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.158
It's a mess in here.
I just got back from school.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.993
This is just you and your brother?

18:40.911 --> 18:42.496
Look at this picture here, now,
who is this?

18:42.579 --> 18:46.416
This is your mom and then this is you
and this is Danny, right?

18:47.167 --> 18:48.502
A few years ago.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.587
Elena, do you know a Mr. Hopkins?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.841
-Yes.
-Well, he got hurt real bad,

18:53.924 --> 18:55.425
and we have to find out
what happened to him.

18:55.717 --> 18:56.593
I don't know what happened.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.428
Look, I know it's hard, honey,
but it would help

18:58.512 --> 19:00.514
if you could just sort of tell us
in your own way.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.432
That's what I want my little girl to do,

19:02.516 --> 19:03.767
just kind of tell it her way.

19:03.851 --> 19:07.229
Elena, a neighbor of yours
saw Danny beat up Mr. Hopkins.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.190
Danny didn't do anything wrong.
He takes good care of me.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.108
Now we will not...

19:12.734 --> 19:14.444
We will not let you get hurt again.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.239
Danny said not to say anything.
I promised, and I won't.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.449
-Where is Danny?
-I don't know.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.285
BOBBY: We need to talk to him.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.744
I don't know where he is.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.208
According to your arrest report,

19:28.292 --> 19:30.752
Scornavaco didn't offer
any resistance this morning.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.088
Under the circumstances, I was wondering

19:33.172 --> 19:35.174
if you would oppose moderate bail
with arraignment.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.592
Up to the DA, I'm afraid.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.468
Sorry to interrupt.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.138
Sharon, I need you
to take over one of my cases.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.764
Oh, I'll be right with you.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.520
I thought we might have some time to talk.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.482
I was hoping you'd help me
learn to get the feel of this place.

19:53.609 --> 19:54.651
Are you free tonight?

19:58.113 --> 19:59.990
-Yeah, I think so.
-How about dinner?

20:01.783 --> 20:03.619
Oh, um, if you'd rather not--

20:03.702 --> 20:05.037
No, no. (chuckles)

20:06.496 --> 20:07.331
Why not?

20:07.414 --> 20:09.708
Oh, great. Talk to you later.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.214
You, uh, finding your way
around okay, Counselor?

20:15.297 --> 20:16.131
Uh-huh.

20:21.136 --> 20:24.806
I'm telling you, Neal, there's a chemistry
between me and that chick.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.893
Mm-hmm. Well, just cool down, lover,

20:27.976 --> 20:29.436
'cause she just asked me out on a date.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.691
What do you mean,
I wasn't on city business?

20:35.067 --> 20:37.444
I was chasing a robber,
that's what cops do.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.446
Your all statement makes it clear.

20:39.529 --> 20:42.699
You were off duty, test-driving a car
for private purchase.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.660
Right, when the incident went down.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.120
Detective, I work for the city, all right.

20:47.204 --> 20:50.123
-I go by the city's regs.
-I never, ever heard of this before.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.209
Happens to be new as of January 1,

20:52.292 --> 20:54.962
as the result of abuse
by your own fellow officers.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.257
If you're off duty,
and there's no resulting apprehension,

20:58.340 --> 20:59.800
there's no reimbursement.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.344
Oh, so if I'd arrested
an innocent citizen,

21:02.427 --> 21:03.679
I could have covered my butt.

21:03.762 --> 21:07.516
Detective, please, I sympathize.

21:07.599 --> 21:11.645
The car owner has zero insurance,
that leaves me on the hook.

21:11.728 --> 21:14.648
Look, here's what you do,
explain the situation to him,

21:14.731 --> 21:16.608
settle for 50 cents on the dollar.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.778
-He'll be happy to take it, believe me.
-That's still $2,000.

21:19.861 --> 21:23.407
Hey, the dough you cops make
compared to us civil servants,

21:23.907 --> 21:25.617
be a little grateful, Detective.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.246
-What happened, you get another date?
-Oh.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.292
-You okay, Mick?
-(mumbling)

21:36.003 --> 21:39.673
Great, first they send me Mrs. Captain,
now I get Barbie.

21:40.215 --> 21:41.216
I want a man lawyer.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.178
Let's just stick to the business at hand,
all right, Mr. Diaz?

21:45.262 --> 21:48.807
Then you tell me how they got Miguelez
without her diming on me.

21:49.349 --> 21:52.269
-Please sit down, Mr. Diaz.
-You tell me!

21:52.352 --> 21:55.188
Mr. Diaz, I will not
continue to speak to you

21:55.272 --> 21:57.149
if you use that tone of voice with me.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.859
I want to know what's going on.

21:58.942 --> 22:02.321
And I am warning you,
don't come any closer.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.531
You're gonna tell me
what's happening here,

22:04.614 --> 22:06.616
-I got it all set.
-Halt!

22:06.700 --> 22:08.368
-What is that?
-I mean it.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.037
Give me the gun, little girl,
you're gonna shoot--

22:12.914 --> 22:15.250
-This is it, this is the ticket.
-MAN: Hey, what's going on in there?

22:16.543 --> 22:17.669
MAN: Counselor, are you all right?

22:20.172 --> 22:22.257
(screaming)

22:24.259 --> 22:28.597
You stay still, lady.
You be quiet now, still and quiet.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.476
-Put down the gun.
-No way, man.

22:32.559 --> 22:35.145
I've been messed over enough,
now I say what goes on here.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.397
-Out of here!
-What do you want?

22:37.481 --> 22:38.648
Out of here!

22:38.732 --> 22:40.484
Let her go, we can work this out.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.194
Just get out of my way, man!

22:42.277 --> 22:43.987
Talking got me this far before.

22:44.571 --> 22:47.366
You fold your hands and pray
there's no one out in the hall.

22:47.449 --> 22:50.619
'Cause if I get it from behind, I shoot.
If I go, she goes.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.038
Mr. Diaz, Mr. Diaz,
I'm Lieutenant Goldblume,

22:53.121 --> 22:55.749
-if you'll talk to me--
-Now everybody wants to talk nice.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.585
I want car keys,
unmarked car with a radio--

22:59.127 --> 23:01.338
-Car keys!
-Here.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.008
It's at the curb out front.

23:05.092 --> 23:07.761
Good, I'll be tuned in to that radio.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.347
You follow me, I hear you.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.807
So don't follow, understand?

23:12.349 --> 23:14.101
Say bye-bye to wifey, Captain.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.144
JOYCE: No!

23:17.687 --> 23:19.231
(police chatter over radio)

23:19.314 --> 23:21.483
You better pray they ain't sending
no messages about us.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.402
WOMAN (on radio): <i>2202, domestic at--</i>

23:23.485 --> 23:24.694
Where do you want me to go?

23:25.153 --> 23:26.738
Don't matter, the highway, anywhere.

23:27.114 --> 23:30.700
-You get me out of here, I won't hurt you.
-WOMAN 2 (on radio): <i>2202, we copy.</i>

23:31.118 --> 23:33.745
All right, work to the ticket.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.665
Oh, you got an idea?

23:39.751 --> 23:41.253
I would ask if you had a gun,

23:41.586 --> 23:44.214
but I don't ask liars no questions.

23:49.469 --> 23:50.470
-Dammit.
-You trying something,

23:50.554 --> 23:52.639
-you trying something?
-No, it's the car.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.266
-I'll do it, I'll do it.
-(engine sputtering)

23:54.349 --> 23:55.892
Pump it, pump it.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.811
I did, I think it's flooded.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.564
-Get out, get out.
-(grunts)

24:00.856 --> 24:03.608
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Possible 211 in progress, 91st and Ogden,</i>

24:04.025 --> 24:05.277
<i>area units respond.</i>

24:08.155 --> 24:09.072
(bell rings)

24:12.909 --> 24:14.953
-May I help you?
-Car keys, give 'em to me.

24:15.036 --> 24:16.037
I don't have a car.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.789
Like hell, give me the keys.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.166
Take my money, I don't care.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.002
-Car keys!
-I swear to you, I don't have a--

24:25.046 --> 24:26.423
The pockets, get the keys.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.341
Oh! I'll try not to move you.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.177
Shut up! Check his pants.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.345
It's true, there are no keys.

24:32.429 --> 24:33.763
-Got to get a car!
-(groans)

24:35.557 --> 24:39.269
(sirens wail)

24:40.937 --> 24:44.274
Get Bernstein, get Buntz,
inform Henry I'm moving.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.738
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Patrols B, C, and D to hostage scene,</i>

24:49.821 --> 24:51.531
<i>all others retain sectors.</i>

24:51.615 --> 24:53.533
What the hell's going on over there?

24:54.075 --> 24:56.203
<i>Anti-crime personnel responding.</i>

24:56.620 --> 25:00.624
I mean with the hostage,
Davenport, Mrs. Furillo.

25:00.707 --> 25:02.918
<i>No communication</i>
<i>with interior premises as of yet.</i>

25:03.001 --> 25:05.253
<i>Uh, 2203, is Flaherty present?</i>

25:06.755 --> 25:09.007
-Flaherty.
<i>-Got a call from uptown impound,</i>

25:09.090 --> 25:13.094
<i>serial numbers on a wreck up there</i>
<i>match the 642 on your stolen tape deck.</i>

25:13.178 --> 25:15.972
No kidding, way to go, cops. Thanks!

25:16.056 --> 25:18.058
-You hear that?
-I heard it.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.686
Can we tone down our concern
about our tape deck right now?

25:22.103 --> 25:24.606
Well, excuse me
for being slightly relieved.

25:25.565 --> 25:28.401
Look, I'm very concerned
about Mrs. Furillo.

25:28.485 --> 25:31.154
If I was the captain,
I'd bust through that window

25:31.238 --> 25:33.490
and blast that guy,
and that's the honest truth.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.492
Stupid honest truth.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.786
Hey, would you lighten up, huh?

25:38.578 --> 25:41.873
All right, I won't be relieved
that they found my tape deck, okay?

25:43.875 --> 25:45.710
That impound lot's in our sector.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.171
Sir...

25:48.547 --> 25:49.881
(sirens wailing)

25:59.140 --> 26:01.893
Diaz, how about just letting us know
everybody's okay inside?

26:01.977 --> 26:04.354
If we know everybody's healthy,
it makes it easier.

26:06.856 --> 26:08.316
Pay phone inside, no luck yet.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.403
Mr. Diaz, the captain's here now,

26:11.486 --> 26:14.656
so we can start straightening
this misunderstanding out.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.326
Do you want me to try it?

26:19.619 --> 26:20.996
Well, what do you think, Frank?

26:22.038 --> 26:23.164
I think I ought to do it.

26:24.624 --> 26:26.793
-I think you're right.
-We're getting a floor plan.

26:26.876 --> 26:29.796
Uh, till then, we stay
passively presented north and west.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.882
We will be taking
the utmost care, Captain.

26:32.966 --> 26:33.800
Do.

26:35.135 --> 26:38.346
Mr. Diaz, at least signal me.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.724
-Is the phone ringing?
-(phone rings)

26:40.807 --> 26:42.976
-Is it in operable condition?
-What is he, dead?

26:44.853 --> 26:46.313
-(phone ringing)
-I didn't mean to...

26:46.938 --> 26:48.398
I'm trying to save his life.

26:48.898 --> 26:50.233
I can't stop the bleeding.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.776
DIAZ: I didn't want to kill anybody.

26:51.860 --> 26:55.155
I wanted my ticket, you messed me over,
it's your fault, you lied.

26:55.238 --> 26:56.781
-I told you, I didn't lie.
-(man coughs)

26:56.865 --> 27:00.702
Look, are there any paper towels
on the shelf?

27:00.785 --> 27:01.870
I don't know what to do.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.039
Then help me.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.003
I don't want him to die.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.964
They caught me,
I wasn't even in the place.

27:14.591 --> 27:16.551
Look, then pick up the phone,

27:17.093 --> 27:20.430
and tell them that, start talking,
because this man is badly hurt.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.142
It stopped ringing, it stopped.

27:24.225 --> 27:25.602
I don't want him to die.

27:25.685 --> 27:28.063
-Then shout, do anything.
-I never killed anybody!

27:28.146 --> 27:29.939
No, I'm not shouting, you hear me?

27:30.023 --> 27:30.857
(sighs)

27:31.274 --> 27:34.611
This is practically a diagram
of Wilcox's inexperience,

27:35.445 --> 27:37.238
pairing Webster with Schromsky.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.075
Brewster at 100 yards. Judas!

27:41.159 --> 27:43.536
Maybe you should call them up
and give them some help.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.082
Well, I shall do just that.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.001
Any word?

27:51.378 --> 27:52.212
None.

27:54.255 --> 27:58.259
Miss Fein, might I ask what you
were doing with a gun in interrogation?

27:59.427 --> 28:00.428
I didn't know.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.014
I wasn't thinking.

28:03.390 --> 28:06.726
You didn't know that weapons
are forbidden inside this precinct?

28:08.186 --> 28:12.774
I got a carry permit
when I joined the PD's Office.

28:15.193 --> 28:16.820
If anything happens to her...

28:19.030 --> 28:20.782
I'd exchange myself
if it would do any good.

28:21.491 --> 28:22.742
That's a noble thought, Miss Fein,

28:22.826 --> 28:25.412
but you have several clients
waiting for representation.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.831
I can't work with this going on.

28:29.499 --> 28:31.876
Of course you can, you must.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.087
You think I wouldn't rather
be at that site myself?

28:34.170 --> 28:36.715
My job is here, I'm needed here.

28:38.508 --> 28:39.342
Raymond.

28:40.218 --> 28:43.138
Get Miss Fein the file on the rapist
that Henley brought in.

28:47.475 --> 28:48.393
Go on now.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.317
McElroy, building engineer.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.530
I was checking your broken air duct
in Interrogation A,

29:01.406 --> 29:02.991
and I found this little mic.

29:06.327 --> 29:12.208
This is it, you see?
"PF," I scratched it there.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.210
I'll see if I can voucher it.

29:14.669 --> 29:16.504
We might need it as evidence, though.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.590
Temporary dealer's license.

29:18.673 --> 29:22.385
Louie, this is the car that the officer
from Hill Street wrecked this morning?

29:22.802 --> 29:24.387
Yeah, did one heck of a job, huh?

29:24.721 --> 29:25.722
What's that, what did he say?

29:27.390 --> 29:29.809
The radio's in the car
that Belker's on the hook for.

29:30.226 --> 29:32.771
This is LaRue's brother-in-law's car.

29:34.314 --> 29:37.066
Two-two-oh-two, what's the deal
on this hostage situation?

29:37.567 --> 29:39.569
WOMAN (on radio): <i>Keep this channel clear</i>
<i>for official communications.</i>

29:39.652 --> 29:41.070
-No, I'm just curious.
-Over there,

29:41.154 --> 29:42.822
isn't that the kid from the pictures?

29:44.866 --> 29:46.701
RENKO: Okay, just forget this, forget it.

29:53.124 --> 29:54.042
Danny Lopez?

29:54.459 --> 29:55.543
-Yeah.
-You're under arrest.

29:55.627 --> 29:56.961
You hear of Arthur Hopkins?

29:57.170 --> 29:58.797
You're taking me in for beating up
that piece of garbage?

29:58.880 --> 30:00.048
You got a hell of an attitude,
don't you, boy?

30:00.131 --> 30:02.634
-Hey, I did what I did.
-Well, how's your sister feel about that?

30:02.717 --> 30:04.803
You leave my--
You leave my sister out of this.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.387
Take this piece of garbage in there.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.891
Hey, I don't care what you do to me,
you just leave my sister out of this.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.059
If I were you, I'd shut up.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.436
(helicopter whirring overhead)

30:14.187 --> 30:16.439
(siren blaring)

30:18.066 --> 30:20.777
Chief wanted me to express
his personal concern, Frank.

30:20.860 --> 30:22.320
-Thank you.
-How is she?

30:22.821 --> 30:24.739
We don't know, he won't pick up the phone.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.617
(phone ringing)

30:33.414 --> 30:36.709
Look, let me negotiate with him.

30:38.002 --> 30:40.255
We've got to get this man out of here.
I can do it.

30:40.505 --> 30:41.589
I don't listen to you.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.883
You've got to, this man is dying,
don't you see?

30:44.634 --> 30:47.345
No matter what you think of me,
no matter what happens to me,

30:47.887 --> 30:48.930
if you get out of here,

30:49.681 --> 30:51.057
you'd be slapped with a murder charge.

30:51.140 --> 30:54.060
A few hours ago,
the most you faced was six months.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.229
You are not on my side.

30:56.604 --> 30:59.732
I understand you never meant
for any of this to happen.

31:00.942 --> 31:02.569
I want all of us to get out of here alive.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.904
You want you to get out of here alive,
maybe him.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.949
The minute I step out the door,
they blow me away.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.659
Not unless you give them
a reason to shoot.

31:09.742 --> 31:10.910
Who are you kidding, lady?

31:11.870 --> 31:14.372
They lied to me so far.
They lie, then they shoot.

31:14.455 --> 31:18.376
Then do it this way, keep me,
let me negotiate to take the man out,

31:18.751 --> 31:21.004
we go back into the storeroom,
shut the door.

31:22.213 --> 31:23.756
We've got to do something, Ricardo,

31:23.840 --> 31:26.175
he's not going to last
much longer without help.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.435
-Yeah.
-Mr. Diaz?

31:36.352 --> 31:39.063
Mr. Diaz,
this is Lieutenant Henry Goldblume,

31:39.147 --> 31:41.482
please stay on the line,
we're gonna work this thing out.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.485
Yeah, right, I'm putting Mrs. Captain on.

31:44.569 --> 31:48.573
You mess with me now,
and Mrs. Captain dies, you understand?

31:48.823 --> 31:50.450
We understand, Mr. Diaz.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.577
Put Miss Davenport on the line.

31:54.621 --> 31:56.623
-Joyce?
-I'm all right, Frank.

31:57.665 --> 32:00.585
But the store owner is badly hurt,
we've got to get him out of here.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.629
-We'll get you all out.
-Mr. Diaz doesn't feel

32:02.712 --> 32:04.631
this is the time for an overall deal.

32:04.714 --> 32:07.634
Deal myself to dead, right, great idea.

32:07.717 --> 32:09.344
But he will help to save the man's life.

32:09.427 --> 32:12.138
Tell him I got conditions, two conditions.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.599
JOYCE: <i>Mr. Diaz will let you in here</i>
<i>on two conditions.</i>

32:14.682 --> 32:16.392
No more charges because I popped the dude.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.897
No, not if he dies,
there's no way they'll go along.

32:21.314 --> 32:22.273
He's not gonna die.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.734
That's what I'm saying,
that's why we're doing this.

32:24.817 --> 32:29.822
Condition one, no charges against him
on the shooting, assuming the man lives.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.115
And I take you back there.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.870
And two, he and I
go back into the storeroom.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.915
You come in, Mrs. Captain is dead.

32:38.998 --> 32:40.166
Joyce, I want you out of there.

32:40.249 --> 32:44.545
JOYCE: <i>I think we have a better chance of</i>
<i>negotiating with Mr. Diaz for my release</i>

32:44.629 --> 32:47.423
if you carry the injured man
out of here first,

32:48.383 --> 32:50.551
and give him a reason to trust you and me.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.845
-I don't trust you.
-It's life and death.

32:54.430 --> 32:56.933
Tell Diaz we meet his conditions,
provided the man lives

32:57.016 --> 32:58.601
and you're eventually
brought out unharmed.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.020
I ain't harming her, just don't come in.

33:04.607 --> 33:05.441
(groans)

33:19.455 --> 33:20.289
Come on in.

33:20.581 --> 33:22.083
Right, okay, here we go.

33:24.377 --> 33:27.171
(indistinct chatter)

33:45.398 --> 33:46.232
MAN: That does it.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.527
(door closes)

33:51.154 --> 33:53.197
HENRY: <i>Mr. Diaz, do you hear this?</i>

33:53.531 --> 33:56.367
<i>The store owner's gonna survive,</i>
<i>he's gonna make it.</i>

33:57.118 --> 34:00.163
Looks like you turned out
to be an express ticket, Mrs. Captain.

34:00.246 --> 34:03.166
-Will you trust me now?
-Yeah, as long as I got this.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.917
So, now what do we do?

34:06.127 --> 34:07.545
Continue negotiating.

34:09.338 --> 34:11.215
You'll probably have to do some time,

34:11.299 --> 34:12.884
I think I can keep it under a year.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.386
Forget it, we're going for total amnesty.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.305
That's not realistic,
you have to give them something,

34:17.388 --> 34:18.890
that's how a negotiation works.

34:18.973 --> 34:20.892
I'm the client, you're the lawyer, okay?

34:22.060 --> 34:24.228
-You ask them.
-He wants total amnesty?

34:25.229 --> 34:26.647
Joyce, say yes or no,

34:26.731 --> 34:28.691
if we give it to him,
will he just think it's a trap?

34:29.233 --> 34:31.569
I don't know, good chance.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.154
What did they say, no? Give me that.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.657
-This is me, who is this?
-Captain Furillo.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.994
I don't want her talking to you,
you two already messed me up!

34:41.829 --> 34:44.373
Well, Frank, let's do it.
He's got your wife in there,

34:44.624 --> 34:47.752
the owner's alive,
the rest of it, I don't give a damn about.

34:48.294 --> 34:50.880
With due respect, Warren,
if it would work, of course,

34:50.963 --> 34:53.424
but I can hear it in her voice,
he's gone over the edge.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.219
If we offer him total amnesty,
I don't think he's gonna believe it,

34:56.302 --> 34:57.970
then we're lost, with no place to go.

34:58.513 --> 35:01.432
With due respect, Captain,
then what the hell else do we do, huh?

35:01.516 --> 35:05.228
The process, the negotiating, small steps,
she's saying, small steps.

35:05.311 --> 35:07.063
(phone rings)

35:07.146 --> 35:10.149
I got nothing more to say to them.
They gotta let me out of this.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.067
Or what?

35:11.651 --> 35:14.362
You kill me and they shoot you?
Or you kill me and then kill yourself?

35:14.445 --> 35:15.696
I don't trust them.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.532
It worked with the back room,
they didn't come in.

35:18.908 --> 35:22.120
They always find a way to jam you up, man!
One thing or another.

35:22.203 --> 35:25.540
You're not thinking straight, Ricardo.
We'll have them on record this time.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.167
Please, let me.

35:28.251 --> 35:29.502
We'll offer this morning's deal

35:29.585 --> 35:31.671
and knock off three months
for their bad faith.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.261
-JOYCE: <i>Lieutenant Goldblume?</i>
-Yes.

35:38.344 --> 35:41.097
<i>My client re-proposes his original deal.</i>

35:42.473 --> 35:45.101
<i>No parole violation, class-A Mis,</i>

35:45.184 --> 35:47.061
and only three months instead of six,

35:48.354 --> 35:52.400
since my client's actions today
have been the result of serious duress.

35:52.483 --> 35:55.653
Yeah, you got it, duress. I got duress!

35:57.321 --> 35:59.115
Let me check it with the ADA.

35:59.198 --> 36:00.867
JOYCE:
<i>Lieutenant, let's not waste time on this.</i>

36:02.201 --> 36:06.080
Listen, man, I got duress.
I want ten days, max.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.499
-Ricardo!
-You got it? Ten days!

36:10.334 --> 36:12.670
He's asking for a further reduction,
he sounds weird.

36:13.754 --> 36:17.967
Mr. Diaz, if we could work out
this ten days idea,

36:18.050 --> 36:20.469
-would you come out?
-No, I don't want ten days either.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.805
What am I going to do
with a lot of baloney sandwiches?

36:23.097 --> 36:24.265
Give me that freedom.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.225
Total amnesty.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.272
Is that what you want, Mr. Diaz,
the impossible?

36:33.357 --> 36:35.943
Fellows, I hate to be the one to say it,

36:36.027 --> 36:37.737
I know they're kind of tight in there,

36:37.820 --> 36:39.030
but what about taking this guy out?

36:39.113 --> 36:40.573
Dammit, Warren, calm down.

36:40.656 --> 36:43.576
We need just some reason, anything,

36:43.659 --> 36:45.703
so when we give in, he'll believe us.

36:45.786 --> 36:48.289
He's got the captain's wife in there,
for pity's sake.

36:48.831 --> 36:50.291
Which reminds him not to believe us.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.709
Why don't we make a false confession,

36:51.792 --> 36:54.170
say we lied to him about Miguelez
and we're sorry?

36:59.967 --> 37:00.801
Where've you been?

37:01.344 --> 37:03.512
Raiding a warehouse full of explosives.

37:04.263 --> 37:06.641
Captain, I... I got Miguelez

37:06.724 --> 37:10.019
because the interrogation room was bugged.

37:10.102 --> 37:11.145
What?

37:11.562 --> 37:12.480
(coughs)

37:13.147 --> 37:15.608
Karp, you know, in communications,

37:16.192 --> 37:17.735
planted a bug in an air duct.

37:17.818 --> 37:20.863
It had nothing to do with me,
it wasn't even supposed to be serious.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.574
Karp thought a typist
was bringing her boyfriend

37:23.658 --> 37:25.034
down there for lunch break.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.411
-But you knew there was a bug?
-Karp came to me.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.831
I mean, he says he was testing it out
and he hears this thing about bombings,

37:30.915 --> 37:32.083
what was I supposed to do, huh?

37:32.166 --> 37:33.960
What you're supposed to do is report bugs

37:34.043 --> 37:36.087
and discipline the personnel
who placed them.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.630
What you do now is come with me.

37:38.965 --> 37:40.174
(phone rings)

37:42.093 --> 37:42.927
Hello?

37:46.097 --> 37:47.515
Mr. Diaz, come here and listen.

37:48.766 --> 37:51.477
NORMAN: <i>Look, Ricardo,</i>
<i>this is Lieutenant Buntz.</i>

37:52.603 --> 37:55.731
<i>We got Miguelez because that room</i>
<i>you were in was bugged.</i>

37:55.815 --> 37:56.941
See, I told you it was like that.

37:57.024 --> 38:00.069
You see, so your attorney didn't know,
the captain didn't know,

38:00.152 --> 38:03.531
and I guess we violated some civil rights.

38:05.658 --> 38:09.996
Diaz, it's the only reason the DA and I
are offering you what you want.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.580
<i>No jail time, probation.</i>

38:11.664 --> 38:13.457
All right, no crap now,

38:13.541 --> 38:16.627
<i>or, Mrs. Captain here,</i>
<i>I'm taking her in here.</i>

38:16.711 --> 38:19.297
Unfortunately,
we have to give you what you want

38:19.380 --> 38:21.424
because we violated your civil rights.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.217
Before we accept, Captain,

38:24.176 --> 38:25.303
what's the point of probation

38:25.386 --> 38:28.264
even if you admit you violated
my client's civil rights?

38:28.347 --> 38:31.475
FRANK: <i>Well, look, probation</i>
<i>merges with his parole,</i>

38:31.559 --> 38:33.644
<i>he just continues</i>
<i>to see his parole officer.</i>

38:35.271 --> 38:36.439
You understand that, Mr. Diaz?

38:37.064 --> 38:39.567
All right, I can live with that.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.822
Nice and easy, Mr. Diaz.

38:47.783 --> 38:49.076
Nice and easy.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.204
Just lay the gun down.

38:56.375 --> 39:00.629
That's right, just lay it down
and keep coming this way.

39:01.630 --> 39:05.217
We'll go back to the precinct, Mr. Diaz,
then we'll process this matter.

39:05.593 --> 39:06.469
Yeah, all right.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.115
I don't know what to say to her.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.825
An apology might be appropriate.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.751
Will it be all right
if I take care of a few things?

39:38.834 --> 39:40.378
Just 15 minutes and we'll go home.

39:40.836 --> 39:43.422
Frank, I'm not going to take
the DA's arraignment.

39:43.506 --> 39:44.840
-Of course not.
-But I've got to bring

39:44.924 --> 39:46.092
somebody up to speed.

39:47.259 --> 39:48.094
Not her.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.930
Sorry, I've got to.

39:56.769 --> 39:57.603
Raymond.

39:58.687 --> 40:00.523
-Find Karp for me, would you?
-Yes, sir.

40:01.690 --> 40:04.693
-Lieutenant Norm Buntz?
-Who wants to know?

40:04.777 --> 40:06.946
This is State Senatorial
Candidate Garfield.

40:07.029 --> 40:09.407
Lieutenant,
I want to personally thank you.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.283
Who knows how many innocent people
might have been hurt

40:11.367 --> 40:13.160
had that bomb gone off at my storefront.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.746
Yeah, uh, glad I could help. Excuse me.

40:16.914 --> 40:17.748
Lieutenant?

40:18.040 --> 40:19.333
Karp... (clears throat)

40:20.167 --> 40:22.336
Uh, Captain's going to can you.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.756
You see that? That's Candidate Garfield.

40:26.048 --> 40:27.258
Tell him about that bug you put.

40:27.341 --> 40:31.345
You tell him Norm Buntz recommends you
for any kind of plumbing job, all right?

40:37.852 --> 40:40.813
All right, Detective, I brought the note.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.233
Thirty-six even monthly payments.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.736
Sir, are you Rob Nelson
of Robert's Motors?

40:48.362 --> 40:50.448
-The one and only.
-PATRICK: You're under arrest.

40:50.531 --> 40:52.575
Possession of stolen property, to wit,

40:52.992 --> 40:57.288
a Carster 692 tape cassette player
owned by me,

40:57.371 --> 40:59.206
in a vehicle owned by you.

41:01.208 --> 41:03.878
Aw, come on.
This has got to be a frame up.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.922
You'll never prove criminal intent, pal.

41:07.006 --> 41:11.093
Maybe not, but just think of all those
court appearances, Mr. Nelson.

41:11.177 --> 41:14.138
And attorney fees.
Not to mention your own time.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.236
Goodwill gesture.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.989
That's so I don't
press charges personally,

41:32.072 --> 41:36.202
but see, if we find any other stolen stuff
in your heap, forget about it.

41:36.285 --> 41:39.205
We go full steam,
put your butt in the hoosegow.

41:43.375 --> 41:45.461
RENKO:
Elena, we had to take Danny into custody.

41:46.295 --> 41:48.088
He said he beat up Mr. Hopkins.

41:48.714 --> 41:50.174
Now Mrs. Jackson here
at the Youth Authority

41:50.257 --> 41:51.759
is going to watch you for a while, okay?

41:53.969 --> 41:57.056
Danny takes good care of me.
Put me in jail with Danny.

41:57.139 --> 41:58.599
No, we can't do that, dear.

41:58.682 --> 42:01.101
BOBBY: Elena, we know some bad things
happened to you.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.312
If you could just talk about them.

42:04.230 --> 42:05.856
Why does Danny have to go to jail?

42:05.940 --> 42:07.566
'Cause that terrible man touched me?

42:08.859 --> 42:10.194
Mr. Hopkins touched you?

42:11.028 --> 42:12.905
He was always coming by after school.

42:13.239 --> 42:15.950
He said not to tell Danny,
Danny would be mad.

42:16.742 --> 42:18.869
But Danny saw what Mr. Hopkins was doing,

42:19.203 --> 42:22.289
Danny wasn't mad at me,
he was mad at Mr. Hopkins.

42:30.256 --> 42:31.090
Polygraph.

42:31.465 --> 42:34.385
I believe her, stone cold.

42:35.135 --> 42:36.011
That old bastard.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.598
Danny said we couldn't tell.

42:39.932 --> 42:41.600
He didn't want me to be ashamed.

42:41.934 --> 42:44.728
Oh, darling, it's okay, it's all right.

42:50.901 --> 42:52.987
-Ready?
-Uh, look, you sure you're up for this?

42:53.779 --> 42:57.283
Detective, I was shaken up today,

42:57.366 --> 42:59.201
but I had a good talk with myself,

42:59.702 --> 43:02.329
and I am not going to let one mistake
get the better of me.

43:04.290 --> 43:05.332
Oh, um,

43:05.791 --> 43:08.961
we are going to be
meeting another couple, okay?

43:10.421 --> 43:11.755
Yeah, sure, fine.

43:14.717 --> 43:16.677
-Disgusting.
-What's that, Detective?

43:16.760 --> 43:18.762
Our new PD almost gets Davenport iced,

43:18.846 --> 43:21.056
but does that interrupt
her social schedule, no.

43:21.140 --> 43:23.100
-Have a nice time.
-That should do it.

43:25.227 --> 43:27.062
-Come on, more new regs?
-Mm.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.440
Change forced on us by circumstance.

43:29.648 --> 43:32.985
Henceforth, all attorneys
are subject to discretionary frisks,

43:33.068 --> 43:34.445
same as other visitors.

43:34.528 --> 43:37.948
If you need a frisk
on Miss Fein, let me know.

43:40.826 --> 43:42.786
(light music playing)

43:43.329 --> 43:44.163
Right this way.

43:45.039 --> 43:45.873
Ooh.

43:46.582 --> 43:48.375
I don't think I'm dressed for this place.

43:48.459 --> 43:49.585
You look fine.

43:52.046 --> 43:52.921
-Mom.
-Hello, dear.

43:53.005 --> 43:55.591
Dad, uh,
this is Detective Neal Washington.

43:55.674 --> 43:56.675
How do you do?

43:58.093 --> 44:00.596
Uh, told you we'd be
meeting another couple.

44:01.180 --> 44:02.014
Detective.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.016
How do you do?

44:04.600 --> 44:05.726
Won't you sit down?

44:06.143 --> 44:08.187
Yes, won't you sit down?

44:14.234 --> 44:15.110
(sighs)

44:18.864 --> 44:20.366
Sharon, is your cheek bruised?

44:20.783 --> 44:22.451
Mother, I told you, I'm fine.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.663
Were you, uh, part of today's excitement?

44:25.996 --> 44:27.039
Uh, no, sir.

44:28.707 --> 44:31.210
(awkward laughter)

44:31.293 --> 44:34.296
I-I just can't believe our daughter
getting mixed up in something like that.

44:35.631 --> 44:37.633
Uh, I'd like a kier, please.

44:38.384 --> 44:41.095
Uh, scotch rocks, double.

44:41.887 --> 44:44.431
(all chuckling)

44:46.266 --> 44:47.142
So...

44:48.268 --> 44:49.812
(all chuckling)

44:50.813 --> 44:51.689
Are, uh...

44:52.147 --> 44:54.733
Are you a basketball fan, Detective?

44:54.817 --> 44:55.943
Uh, yes, sir.

44:56.568 --> 44:59.279
Well, who do you like
to make the playoffs?

45:02.700 --> 45:03.575
(sighs)

45:03.659 --> 45:06.161
-Walt Frazier.
-One of the greats.

45:06.245 --> 45:09.832
I saw him score 30 points
in a quarter once.

45:09.915 --> 45:11.125
Here we are, dear.

45:11.750 --> 45:14.002
-Sharon.
-Okay, take it easy, now.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.046
(imitates gun, laughs)

45:16.714 --> 45:17.548
MRS. FEIN: Come along, dear.

45:18.173 --> 45:19.007
(smooches)

45:34.189 --> 45:36.734
Oh, you were such a good sport.

45:37.151 --> 45:37.985
Thanks.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.283
That's my car.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.204
Would you, uh--

45:49.747 --> 45:51.331
Would you like to follow me home?

45:51.790 --> 45:52.791
That my reward?

45:53.375 --> 45:55.169
(chuckles) What do you mean?

45:55.252 --> 45:57.963
For showing your folks how liberal
and independent you are?

45:58.547 --> 45:59.673
For giving them a shock.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.468
That wasn't the idea.

46:02.551 --> 46:03.385
Oh, no?

46:04.344 --> 46:06.346
Your mother couldn't even
look me in the eye.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.849
And your father
could only babble about sports.

46:09.516 --> 46:11.643
And I caught you enjoying the whole thing.

46:12.019 --> 46:14.772
Daddy's little girl,
getting back some of her own.

46:15.230 --> 46:17.191
I'd stick to basketball if I were you.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.192
You know something?

46:19.234 --> 46:21.737
People like you
will always be strangers on the Hill.

46:22.613 --> 46:25.157
And strangers
always end up causing trouble.

46:30.788 --> 46:32.831
I don't need a lecture.

46:33.749 --> 46:35.334
Go back to Farmingdale.

46:40.255 --> 46:41.465
I guess this proves it.

46:45.677 --> 46:47.554
You'd do anything for a plea bargain.

46:47.638 --> 46:48.972
(soft chuckle)

46:53.060 --> 46:53.894
I guess so.

47:02.694 --> 47:04.696
I knew you were so close.

47:09.493 --> 47:10.327
I knew...

47:19.419 --> 47:20.504
I would have died.

47:25.884 --> 47:26.718
(sniffles)

47:29.012 --> 47:29.847
(sobbing)

47:42.526 --> 47:45.529
(closing theme playing)
