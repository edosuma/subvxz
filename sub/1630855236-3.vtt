WEBVTT

00:10.092 --> 00:13.004
All right.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.056
I'll call you
about the weekend.

00:32.008 --> 00:33.044
Steve.

00:36.076 --> 00:38.020
What are you
doing here?

00:38.020 --> 00:39.060
I got a job
for you.

00:39.060 --> 00:42.028
I work Homicide.
I already got a job, thanks.

00:42.028 --> 00:43.092
Shaquille Oliver.

00:43.092 --> 00:46.036
London's New
gangster king.

00:46.036 --> 00:48.080
We're setting up a task force
to go after him.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.060
Properly resourced.

00:50.060 --> 00:52.032
We can do
what we joined up to do--

00:52.032 --> 00:54.052
take down the bad guy.

00:54.052 --> 00:56.020
Who's "we"?

00:56.020 --> 00:58.028
Right now?
You and me.

00:58.028 --> 01:01.072
I'll take command as soon as
I get a replacement at Fala.

01:01.072 --> 01:03.000
Come on.
What do you say?

01:06.032 --> 01:08.024
Can I ask
a couple of questions?

01:08.024 --> 01:09.084
Of course.

01:09.084 --> 01:11.060
Where is
Farmer Hani's phone?

01:11.060 --> 01:13.084
Come on, Fragile.

01:13.084 --> 01:15.028
That's water
under the bridge.

01:15.028 --> 01:16.088
This is big.
It matters.

01:16.088 --> 01:18.020
What,
and Farah doesn't?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.064
Second question--

01:23.064 --> 01:27.036
you still have an affair
with Lizzie Adama?

01:27.036 --> 01:29.080
That's none of
your damn business.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.084
See...

01:31.084 --> 01:34.064
here's my problem--

01:34.064 --> 01:37.024
I don't trust you.

01:41.064 --> 01:42.092
Find someone else.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.020
- Yeah.
- Steve Bradshaw.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.024
<i>-Steve, Jim Fadden.
Need you in here now.</i>

01:50.024 --> 01:52.044
Okay. I'm on my way.

01:52.044 --> 01:54.000
Yeah. Okay.
I'll be there in 20.

02:02.008 --> 02:03.080
I don't want to know why
it's difficult.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.064
I just want you
to get it done.

02:05.064 --> 02:06.084
Thank you.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.020
Sorry, sir.
I was on Egremont.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.068
Forget Egremont.
Do you know about this?

02:09.068 --> 02:10.088
Yeah.
I heard it in the car.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.076
Brannon's running round
with a blond kid

02:12.076 --> 02:14.048
and a limping dog.

02:14.048 --> 02:17.008
Not one bloody sighting
in a city

02:17.008 --> 02:19.020
with half a million
CCTV cameras.

02:19.020 --> 02:20.048
And now he's put
this thing up.

02:20.048 --> 02:21.092
How many views?
- 800,500--

02:21.092 --> 02:23.056
Nearly a million views.

02:23.056 --> 02:25.088
And our tech people are saying
it's hard to take down.

02:25.088 --> 02:28.024
A man openly threatening
the police,

02:28.024 --> 02:29.048
threatening to kill
his own child.

02:29.048 --> 02:30.096
Who's FLO on this?

02:30.096 --> 02:32.040
Cathy Teel
will be freaking out.

02:32.040 --> 02:33.096
Elaine is the FLO.

02:33.096 --> 02:35.072
And she's at home with her kids
for another hour.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.016
We'll send a PC--
Lizzie Adama.

02:37.016 --> 02:38.096
Call her governor.
Set it up.

02:38.096 --> 02:40.024
It's better
you call him.

02:40.024 --> 02:41.096
Oh, right.
You two hate each other.

02:41.096 --> 02:44.088
Brilliant.
All right, I'll do it.

02:44.088 --> 02:46.088
You got the Walker report
to CPS?

02:46.088 --> 02:48.056
Not yet.

02:48.056 --> 02:49.080
Because there's stuff I'd be
obliged to put in the report

02:49.080 --> 02:51.024
that leads away
from Walker.

02:51.024 --> 02:52.084
That's what I wanted to
talk to you about.

02:52.084 --> 02:54.076
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Sir, there's another suspect.

03:02.004 --> 03:05.000
Hey. You seen it?
Brannon?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.064
Yeah.
It's unbelievable.

03:06.064 --> 03:08.096
And he's getting likes--
more than two dozen of them.

03:08.096 --> 03:10.068
Matt Brannon,
you are my hero.

03:10.068 --> 03:12.024
I mean,
who would even write that?

03:12.024 --> 03:14.092
It doesn't make us
look good, either.

03:14.092 --> 03:16.012
What do you mean?

03:16.012 --> 03:17.084
Brannon says it--
he had a family,

03:17.084 --> 03:19.020
then the police
took it away from him.

03:19.020 --> 03:20.040
He killed his girlfriend,
you idiot.

03:20.040 --> 03:22.020
Okay, yeah,
that's wrong.

03:22.020 --> 03:23.084
but what he's saying is
he was driven to it

03:23.084 --> 03:25.044
because we
got involved.

03:25.044 --> 03:27.020
Don't look at me
like that.

03:27.020 --> 03:30.016
Look at the facts-- the court
threw out Georgina's evidence.

03:30.016 --> 03:31.060
Why?

03:31.060 --> 03:33.028
Because Lizzie scared her
into believing her kid

03:33.028 --> 03:34.080
might get taken away.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.064
- What the fuck?
- It's not your fault, Lizzie.

03:36.064 --> 03:38.016
It's about experience,
isn't it?

03:38.016 --> 03:40.064
What did Daddy always say?
We're not social workers.

03:40.064 --> 03:42.056
Jesus,
you are an idiot.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.036
What, you left a little comment
on his YouTube page?

03:44.036 --> 03:45.056
Oh, piss off,
you little--

03:45.056 --> 03:46.088
Yeah? Little what?

03:46.088 --> 03:48.060
All right, children.
.

03:53.008 --> 03:54.040
Right.

03:54.040 --> 03:55.064
Lizzie, Arif,
Homicide have requested

03:55.064 --> 03:56.088
you go to
Georgina's mom,

03:56.088 --> 03:58.064
try to keep her calm.

03:58.064 --> 04:00.028
Tell her that we're getting
the video taken down, please.

04:00.028 --> 04:02.020
And go.

04:02.020 --> 04:03.048
Go.

04:03.048 --> 04:04.096
The rest of us,
let's use the fact

04:04.096 --> 04:07.020
that the world now knows
what Brannon looks like.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.004
Robert McCarthy
saw Tania arguing

04:09.004 --> 04:11.076
with a man in the park--
a man who drove a green Jaguar,

04:11.076 --> 04:15.024
who sometimes dropped her off
in that green Jaguar.

04:15.024 --> 04:17.088
Tania's violin teacher,
Adrian Stephenson,

04:17.088 --> 04:20.008
drove a green Jaguar.

04:20.008 --> 04:22.028
I said I thought there was
someone else in Tania's life.

04:22.028 --> 04:25.004
I think Stephenson
might be him.

04:25.004 --> 04:26.044
Where do you want to go
with this?

04:26.044 --> 04:29.012
I want to talk to Tania's dad,
Ben Mills.

04:29.012 --> 04:32.092
Tania's mum said Ben thought
Tania was up to something.

04:32.092 --> 04:34.040
Maybe he can
shed some light.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.020
He would have known Stephenson.

04:36.020 --> 04:37.076
What else?

04:37.076 --> 04:40.016
Can Elaine take a look
at Stephenson?

04:40.016 --> 04:42.088
He left Tania's school
soon after she disappeared.

04:42.088 --> 04:44.032
Where did he go?

04:44.032 --> 04:45.076
If he was having a relationship
with her--

04:45.076 --> 04:47.028
It's a big "if."

04:47.028 --> 04:48.084
Well, then he's unlikely
to have stopped there.

04:48.084 --> 04:50.028
You know the patterns.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.048
All I have to do
is check on VISA.

04:51.048 --> 04:52.088
If Stephenson
is on there,

04:52.088 --> 04:54.040
I just call the officers
dealing with it.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.064
Okay.

04:55.064 --> 04:56.092
But for God's sake,
be delicate.

04:56.092 --> 04:58.064
I can do delicate.

04:58.064 --> 05:00.060
I don't know. Sarah.

05:00.060 --> 05:02.000
Sir.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.096
Brannon-- I think we might
have a break.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.056
There's the number.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.048
Called Molly Daniels' phone
at 8:15 this morning.

05:08.048 --> 05:10.068
- So we know whose phone it is?
- It's a burner.

05:10.068 --> 05:12.032
But we checked with the shop
where it was sold,

05:12.032 --> 05:15.048
and Brannon is on CCTV buying it
three days ago.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.012
You're tracking
the phone?

05:17.012 --> 05:20.000
It was last used at a motorway
services on the M6.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.084
It looks like
he's heading north.

05:21.084 --> 05:24.052
Okay.
Bring Miss Daniels in.

05:24.052 --> 05:29.020
She likes you.
You can interview her, with Lee.

05:29.020 --> 05:31.044
No offense to Lee,
but if Steve Bradshaw

05:31.044 --> 05:33.068
is helping out on this,
can he interview with me?

05:33.068 --> 05:35.032
Why?

05:35.032 --> 05:36.060
Molly'll be tough.

05:36.060 --> 05:38.004
She'll be utterly loyal
to Brannon.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.044
Me and Steve,
we were a team.

05:40.044 --> 05:42.052
I'll ask him.
Go get Molly.

05:42.052 --> 05:44.064
Quick and quiet,
or she'll warn Brannon.

05:47.020 --> 05:49.016
Went down
about 20 minutes ago.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.084
Neil called me from work
to tell me.

05:51.084 --> 05:54.068
How is anyone even allowed
to do that?

05:54.068 --> 05:56.008
Like his own TV show.

05:56.008 --> 05:57.092
Like he's the one
that's been treated wrong.

05:57.092 --> 05:59.056
How?
- I know.

05:59.056 --> 06:01.020
But it has been
taken down.

06:07.016 --> 06:09.052
I could really do with a ciggie
right now.

06:09.052 --> 06:11.028
Terrified of setting off
the alarms.

06:17.084 --> 06:20.060
I'll disarm it.
Just this once.

06:20.060 --> 06:21.088
Okay?

06:29.004 --> 06:30.056
He's a good boy,
isn't he?

06:33.032 --> 06:34.084
Is he your fella?

06:34.084 --> 06:36.004
No.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.052
She's a heartbreaker, Cathy.

06:37.052 --> 06:39.028
Oh, shut up, Arif.

06:39.028 --> 06:40.052
Idiot.

06:51.028 --> 06:53.084
He's going to kill her,
isn't he?

06:53.084 --> 06:56.040
No. No.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.080
We're gonna
find him.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.008
Yeah, but that's what
he wants.

06:59.008 --> 07:00.052
He wants you to find him,
and kill him.

07:00.052 --> 07:03.012
And then, he'll go down
in a blaze of glory.

07:03.012 --> 07:05.092
I want you to tell everyone
at the police

07:05.092 --> 07:07.012
I don't want him
to die.

07:07.012 --> 07:08.040
I want you
to arrest him.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.064
I want you to tell them that.
Yeah?

07:09.064 --> 07:11.040
Okay.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.008
Because for him, living is like
the worst punishment,

07:13.008 --> 07:18.044
so I want him to live a long, long...

07:18.044 --> 07:19.092
long time.

07:23.024 --> 07:25.016
'Cause he knows
what he's done.

07:25.016 --> 07:26.064
He really knows.

07:39.068 --> 07:42.076
- Are you okay?
- Shaw's offered me a job.

07:42.076 --> 07:45.020
Task force going after
Shaquille Oliver.

07:45.020 --> 07:49.016
So what is it?
Drugs? Guns? Gangs?

07:49.016 --> 07:51.020
All of the above.

07:51.020 --> 07:54.056
You know why he wants you,
don't you?

07:54.056 --> 07:56.060
He wants you undercover.

07:56.060 --> 07:58.068
Can you
handle that again,

07:58.068 --> 08:00.048
with Shaw the man who's
got your back?

08:08.068 --> 08:12.036
You read the intelligence
about her and Brannon?

08:12.036 --> 08:14.036
What they went through together
when they were kids?

08:14.036 --> 08:16.056
Yeah.
I know why she's helping him.

08:16.056 --> 08:18.008
The phone work.

08:18.008 --> 08:19.048
I'm up on that, too.

08:24.012 --> 08:28.040
Exhibit LMC4--
your mobile phone.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.056
A download has shown a call
made to you this morning

08:30.056 --> 08:32.088
by a prepaid,
unregistered mobile phone

08:32.088 --> 08:34.040
linked to Matt Brannon.

08:34.040 --> 08:36.004
What did he say
to you?

08:36.004 --> 08:39.056
He just said
how he was feeling.

08:39.056 --> 08:42.052
And he said that it was all
the police's fault.

08:42.052 --> 08:44.096
And don't worry,
he would never hurt Skye.

08:44.096 --> 08:46.040
So you really
believe that?

08:46.040 --> 08:49.024
Yeah. I do.
He loves that girl.

08:49.024 --> 08:50.068
If you lot
hadn't have got involved--

08:50.068 --> 08:53.032
In less than 48 hours
after he was released,

08:53.032 --> 08:56.020
he got raging drunk,
and stabbed Georgina to death.

08:56.020 --> 08:59.064
Then, he sat over her dead body
and finished his drink.

08:59.064 --> 09:01.040
He's a cold-blooded
killer,

09:01.040 --> 09:03.080
so don't give me that rubbish
about Skye not being at risk.

09:05.084 --> 09:09.000
Molly...

09:09.000 --> 09:12.044
I understand what Matt
means to you,

09:12.044 --> 09:15.040
how he was there for you
when you were kids.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.008
It earns a lot
of loyalty, huh?

09:18.008 --> 09:21.000
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
I'm not worried about Skye.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.064
I told him
to hand himself in.

09:22.064 --> 09:24.016
The mobile phone
he called you from

09:24.016 --> 09:28.008
has been cell-sighted
on the M6.

09:28.008 --> 09:29.040
I don't know anything
about that.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.072
Molly, come on.

09:30.072 --> 09:32.000
If you really want
to help Sky, then--

09:32.000 --> 09:34.032
Okay. Okay.

09:38.040 --> 09:42.004
He's got some mates up there--
people that he's worked with.

09:42.004 --> 09:45.004
Then give us
their names.

09:45.004 --> 09:46.056
If I do that,
then you lot need to drop

09:46.056 --> 09:48.028
all the charges
against me.

09:48.028 --> 09:49.072
I'll be putting myself
at risk.

09:49.072 --> 09:53.036
If we do that,
you'll give us the names.

09:53.036 --> 09:55.008
I will.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.024
We don't want them.

10:01.024 --> 10:02.056
What?

10:02.056 --> 10:03.080
A little girl's life's
in danger,

10:03.080 --> 10:05.032
and you're
playing games.

10:05.032 --> 10:06.056
After two days
successfully hiding from us,

10:06.056 --> 10:08.016
Matt's become an idiot.

10:08.016 --> 10:09.056
A burner phone that makes
one call to a number

10:09.056 --> 10:11.028
he knows
we'll be monitoring.

10:11.028 --> 10:14.004
A burner phone now conveniently
making its way up the M6.

10:14.004 --> 10:15.052
Does he think
we're idiots?

10:15.052 --> 10:17.008
Who called you, Molly?
It wasn't him, was it?

10:17.008 --> 10:19.012
Right now, you're a small part
of a big picture,

10:19.012 --> 10:21.068
because our priority
is to save Skye's life.

10:21.068 --> 10:23.064
You have a chance
to help us.

10:23.064 --> 10:25.036
But if she's found dead,
and you didn't help us,

10:25.036 --> 10:27.000
then, that picture
will change,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.056
and we'll have more energy
to focus on you.

10:29.056 --> 10:31.024
You've not only assisted
an offender,

10:31.024 --> 10:32.064
you'll be complicit
in child murder.

10:32.064 --> 10:35.080
You understand me?

10:35.080 --> 10:39.032
It wasn't Matt who called,
was it?

10:39.032 --> 10:40.096
The phone was a ruse.

10:40.096 --> 10:42.076
Brannon got someone else
to call.

10:42.076 --> 10:44.060
Molly's role was to hold out
for a while,

10:44.060 --> 10:46.040
then give up some associates
of Brannon's in Liverpool.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.052
<i>So we chase our tails
in [Indistinct]</i>

10:48.052 --> 10:50.008
<i>while he's sheltered in place
down here?</i>

10:50.008 --> 10:52.088
- That's what we think.
<i>- So what's the plan?</i>

10:52.088 --> 10:55.024
We know Brannon's watching
the news on social media,

10:55.024 --> 10:57.060
so we put out an appeal--
say he might be up north.

10:57.060 --> 10:59.048
Be on the lookout,
do not approach, et cetera.

10:59.048 --> 11:01.080
We make it seem like
we swallowed the ruse.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.048
He might get careless,
show his face.

11:03.048 --> 11:04.068
Good.

11:04.068 --> 11:05.088
I'll set that
in motion here.

11:05.088 --> 11:07.032
Anything else?

11:07.032 --> 11:08.096
We haven't discussed this
with DI Shaw yet,

11:08.096 --> 11:11.008
but the young PC,
Lizzie Adama,

11:11.008 --> 11:13.052
has developed a rapport
with Cathy Teel.

11:13.052 --> 11:15.080
Cathy knew Brannon's life
before he knew Georgina--

11:15.080 --> 11:17.040
what he did,
where he did it.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.020
Put Lizzie in a car
with Cathy,

11:19.020 --> 11:21.092
let Cathy take her to
some of his old haunts,

11:21.092 --> 11:23.024
see if they
spot anything.

11:23.024 --> 11:24.088
At the very least,
focus the police search.

11:24.088 --> 11:27.004
There's no way I'm putting them
in a car on their own.

11:27.004 --> 11:28.076
Brannon hates
both of them.

11:28.076 --> 11:31.004
I'll be in a backup car,
and in radio contact with them.

11:31.004 --> 11:33.068
<i>Not you, Sarah.
I need you back on Egremont.</i>

11:33.068 --> 11:35.036
<i>Tania's dad's
kicking up a stink.</i>

11:35.036 --> 11:36.088
<i>He said Walker's
been released,</i>

11:36.088 --> 11:38.044
<i>and he's threatening
to go to the press.</i>

11:38.044 --> 11:40.048
<i>Christ,
maybe</i> he'll <i>put out a video.</i>

11:43.044 --> 11:45.032
I'll go in the car
with them.

11:45.032 --> 11:46.080
<i>Are you okay with that,
Kieran?</i>

11:49.036 --> 11:51.012
That'll be
up to Lizzie.

11:51.012 --> 11:52.048
It was partly
her suggestion.

11:52.048 --> 11:53.092
Like I said,
it'll be up to Lizzie.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.036
They want me to
drive around with Cathy,

11:58.036 --> 12:00.048
get us an idea of where Brannon
used to hang out.

12:00.048 --> 12:01.096
And they think
you'll actually see him?

12:01.096 --> 12:04.012
Well, it's more about
new places to search.

12:04.012 --> 12:06.000
Oi, oi.
What are you two up to?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.052
This is the men's room, Lizzie.

12:07.052 --> 12:10.068
- Piss off, Colin.
- Just joking.

12:10.068 --> 12:12.048
Look...

12:12.048 --> 12:14.036
I was well out of order
this morning.

12:14.036 --> 12:18.068
What I said about Brannon.
It was stupid.

12:18.068 --> 12:19.096
I'm sorry.

12:26.028 --> 12:28.064
Did you used to know Brannon
from before?

12:28.064 --> 12:30.080
No. Why?

12:30.080 --> 12:32.096
Well, it's just that
you called him "Matt"

12:32.096 --> 12:35.020
when we had to cuff him
in holding.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.036
Well, "Matt" is his name.

12:37.036 --> 12:38.064
I find people
are more cooperative

12:38.064 --> 12:40.040
if you treat them with
a bit of respect.

12:42.004 --> 12:43.080
Thanks for that, Colin.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.064
My lawyer heard
you do have evidence

12:53.064 --> 12:57.000
linking Walker to Tania,
and you still let him go.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.092
A convicted sex offender.
It's crazy.

12:59.092 --> 13:02.020
It's the law.

13:02.020 --> 13:04.032
If you go public
about this,

13:04.032 --> 13:08.092
if you even think of going after
Walker again yourself,

13:08.092 --> 13:10.096
you can forget
what will happen to you.

13:10.096 --> 13:12.024
You will burn
our entire case.

13:12.024 --> 13:13.072
Do you understand me,
Mr. Mills?

13:21.028 --> 13:23.096
I wanted to ask you
about Adrienne Stephenson,

13:23.096 --> 13:25.032
Tania's violin teacher.

13:25.032 --> 13:27.072
Mm. Him.
What do you want to know?

13:27.072 --> 13:30.000
Was he important
to Tania?

13:30.000 --> 13:33.088
Well, he made her
a brilliant player.

13:33.088 --> 13:37.012
"Important."
That's an odd word.

13:37.012 --> 13:40.012
"Important to Tania."
I see.

13:40.012 --> 13:42.072
I knew something
was going on.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.060
I thought it would be
some spotty youth,

13:44.060 --> 13:47.016
not that--
that self-satisfied bastard.

13:47.016 --> 13:48.088
It's just one line
of inquiry.

13:48.088 --> 13:51.080
We don't have any evidence there
was an improper relationship.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.044
Yeah, there was.

13:53.044 --> 13:56.000
I'm the expert in deception,
after all.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.096
- Do you have evidence, then?
- No.

13:57.096 --> 14:00.052
Just knowledge.
- Did your wife say anything?

14:00.052 --> 14:01.076
God, no.

14:01.076 --> 14:03.056
She thought Stephenson
walked on water.

14:03.056 --> 14:07.032
So on what do you base
your knowledge?

14:07.032 --> 14:10.052
How Tania was
these last few weeks.

14:10.052 --> 14:15.080
She gave up the violin, which
she'd loved since she was 5.

14:15.080 --> 14:18.072
Here grades
were slipping.

14:18.072 --> 14:20.052
She was in freefall.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.052
Hey, Bradshaw.

14:25.052 --> 14:28.016
News flash--
that kid you helped arrest,

14:28.016 --> 14:29.080
the chicken shop shooter,

14:29.080 --> 14:33.008
Shaquille had just moved
his moment into a new flat.

14:33.008 --> 14:35.048
Shaquille just bought
his silence.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.024
So that kid's gonna do
his 18 years,

14:37.024 --> 14:39.036
and he's gonna come out of jail
a real hard case.

14:39.036 --> 14:41.044
And the only one
who's going to employ him is,

14:41.044 --> 14:43.052
yes, you guessed it, Shaquille.

14:43.052 --> 14:45.016
Why are you telling me shit
I already know?

14:45.016 --> 14:46.056
Because you can be
as rude about me

14:46.056 --> 14:49.004
and about my personal life
as you like,

14:49.004 --> 14:51.008
but do not doubt--
not for one second--

14:51.008 --> 14:54.004
my skill or determination
to bring this fucker down.

14:54.004 --> 14:57.032
But you only want me because
you want me to go undercover.

14:57.032 --> 15:00.008
So why don't you have the balls
to say it?

15:00.008 --> 15:01.052
Okay.

15:01.052 --> 15:03.036
I want you
to go undercover.

15:08.036 --> 15:12.040
You know why I only see my sons
every second weekend?

15:12.040 --> 15:14.068
Because I was UC
for three years.

15:14.068 --> 15:18.020
And when I came out,
my wife didn't like me.

15:18.020 --> 15:20.008
I didn't like myself.

15:22.036 --> 15:24.064
I appreciate you trying to
bring down a bad guy.

15:24.064 --> 15:27.088
I really do.

15:27.088 --> 15:29.076
But I still don't
trust you.

15:34.088 --> 15:38.012
This one's from
North Yorkshire, July 2017.

15:38.012 --> 15:39.068
Do you not bloody know
what "delicate" means?

15:39.068 --> 15:41.032
Excuse me?

15:41.032 --> 15:43.004
A cease and desist letter
from Adrian Stephenson's

15:43.004 --> 15:45.020
extremely well-connected
solicitors,

15:45.020 --> 15:46.060
threatening legal action

15:46.060 --> 15:49.032
if these outrageous
and libelous inquiries

15:49.032 --> 15:51.044
into his teaching record
do not stop immediately.

15:51.044 --> 15:53.020
Sir.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.092
You need to stop wasting
time on shit you can't prove,

15:54.092 --> 15:57.048
and send the Ray Walker report
to the CPS for charges.

15:57.048 --> 15:59.020
No.

15:59.020 --> 16:01.060
- What did you say?
-"No."

16:01.060 --> 16:03.000
Elaine.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.020
There are three
open investigations

16:05.020 --> 16:07.088
into historic complaints
of serious sexual assault--

16:07.088 --> 16:11.028
including rape-- by girls who
were taught by Mr. Stephenson.

16:11.028 --> 16:13.092
They're from different schools
in different force areas.

16:13.092 --> 16:15.052
The girls don't know
each other,

16:15.052 --> 16:18.020
but the method appears to
corroborate their accounts.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.076
Well, in that case,

16:19.076 --> 16:24.024
bugger Mr. Stephenson, MBE,
and his fancy lawyers.

16:24.024 --> 16:27.052
I don't need to apologize
to you, do I?

16:27.052 --> 16:29.008
Good.

16:29.008 --> 16:30.080
Well done.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.032
Sir...

16:32.032 --> 16:33.084
Oh, no.

16:33.084 --> 16:35.032
...I want to dig up
Morville Park.

16:35.032 --> 16:36.072
The whole park?

16:36.072 --> 16:39.060
Just that area,

16:39.060 --> 16:42.016
planted by Stephenson
and girls from Hamlets.

16:42.016 --> 16:44.032
According to just about everyone
who knows him,

16:44.032 --> 16:47.020
Stephenson has zero interest
in the community,

16:47.020 --> 16:50.008
in public works,
in anything but himself.

16:50.008 --> 16:54.068
And yet he did this three days
after Tania disappeared.

16:54.068 --> 16:56.020
You think you're
gonna find her?

16:59.080 --> 17:01.016
Steve.

17:03.084 --> 17:06.076
Good to see you, Lizzie.

17:06.076 --> 17:08.032
This is Cathy Teel.

17:08.032 --> 17:10.052
Hi, Cathy.
I'm Steve.

17:10.052 --> 17:12.004
Hi.

17:12.004 --> 17:13.052
We're gonna put you
in the back with Lizzie.

17:18.004 --> 17:20.044
This is where we are.

17:20.044 --> 17:24.048
This is the memorial garden
planted by the Hamlets girls.

17:24.048 --> 17:27.068
And that's
the memorial garden now.

17:27.068 --> 17:31.044
So, you know what
you're looking for, Dr. Sejal.

17:31.044 --> 17:33.040
It's a small area,
so it won't take long

17:33.040 --> 17:34.096
to tape out and grid,

17:34.096 --> 17:36.076
and start scanning
with ground-penetrating radar.

17:36.076 --> 17:38.080
It will spot any anomalies
in the ground soil

17:38.080 --> 17:40.048
that might be caused
by organic matter.

17:40.048 --> 17:42.020
Okay. Over to you.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.080
Come on, guys.
With me.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.088
Sarah.

17:46.088 --> 17:48.056
This is Harry Metcalf.

17:48.056 --> 17:50.056
He was a park keeper here
back in 1997.

17:50.056 --> 17:53.056
Mr. Metcalf, thank you
for coming out so early.

17:53.056 --> 17:56.076
I'm an early riser.
And it's Harry.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.056
Do you remember when
the memorial garden

17:58.056 --> 18:00.004
was planted, Harry?

18:00.004 --> 18:02.012
I do indeed.
All the girls were thespians.

18:02.012 --> 18:03.060
I was terrified
in case one of them

18:03.060 --> 18:04.088
chopped off

18:04.088 --> 18:07.060
But the worst they got
was blisters.

18:07.060 --> 18:11.080
Look at the garden now. Beautiful.

18:11.080 --> 18:14.064
Do you remember Mr. Stephenson
at all?

18:14.064 --> 18:17.064
Hard to forget that one.
Very good at organizing.

18:17.064 --> 18:20.000
"Go there. Do that.
Carry this."

18:20.000 --> 18:21.088
Not so good
at digging.

18:21.088 --> 18:23.092
Said he had to look after
his hands.

18:23.092 --> 18:26.076
So he was here first,
setting up?

18:26.076 --> 18:29.028
That's right.
Another early riser.

18:35.084 --> 18:37.060
That was one of
the Youngs' places.

18:37.060 --> 18:39.084
Closed about
six years ago.

18:39.084 --> 18:42.096
Brannon was
a bouncer there.

18:42.096 --> 18:44.072
I used to score
in there.

18:47.052 --> 18:49.000
When I didn't have
the money,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.076
I'd take punters around the back
until I did.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.092
That's where
the security guards slept.

19:06.068 --> 19:08.040
I've been in there,
and all.

19:14.024 --> 19:17.036
The things I've done, Lizzie.

19:17.036 --> 19:20.084
No wonder Georgie got away from
me as quick as she could.

19:29.092 --> 19:32.076
No sign of him.

19:32.076 --> 19:34.020
Where next, Cathy?

19:42.080 --> 19:46.064
Have you ever lost someone
you loved before their time?

19:51.012 --> 19:52.048
My sister.

19:56.096 --> 20:00.028
I was 15.
She was 17.

20:00.028 --> 20:03.016
Car crash.

20:03.016 --> 20:04.064
Drunk driver.

20:08.004 --> 20:11.040
It's the anniversary
next weekend.

20:11.040 --> 20:14.072
My parents always do a memorial
for her.

20:14.072 --> 20:16.008
Are you going?

20:19.008 --> 20:22.008
No.

20:22.008 --> 20:25.004
The last two years
I haven't.

20:25.004 --> 20:26.052
Why not?

20:28.076 --> 20:30.016
It just...

20:34.012 --> 20:35.048
It makes me
too sad.

20:39.064 --> 20:42.000
You did tell her
about this?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.036
Yes.

20:43.036 --> 20:45.092
I said I'd call her
if we had any news.

20:45.092 --> 20:47.060
I'm sorry.

20:47.060 --> 20:49.020
I know you said you'd call,
but I Just couldn't sit at home.

20:49.020 --> 20:50.040
I understand.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.020
They're just
scanning the ground.

20:52.020 --> 20:55.076
I'm afraid I still find it
difficult to believe.

20:55.076 --> 20:57.020
Adrian Stephenson.

20:57.020 --> 20:59.064
It's just one line
of inquiry.

20:59.064 --> 21:02.060
You're digging up
a park.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.032
And him and Tania.

21:04.032 --> 21:06.040
I just can't believe it.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.036
He was so professional. Dedicated.

21:09.036 --> 21:11.008
Tough on her,
in fact.

21:14.024 --> 21:15.064
I'm sorry. It's...

21:19.024 --> 21:21.012
Why didn't she
talk to me?

21:24.000 --> 21:27.052
Detective.

21:27.052 --> 21:28.096
Excuse me a minute.

21:38.004 --> 21:40.084
Basically, we're looking for
resistivity, anomalies,

21:40.084 --> 21:43.076
anything that might be produced
by decaying organic matter.

21:43.076 --> 21:45.016
This was
the most promising.

21:45.016 --> 21:48.060
We did an ERT profile,
and we got this.

21:51.020 --> 21:52.076
Is it a grave?

21:52.076 --> 21:55.052
It's an anomalous depression
about 2 meters down.

21:55.052 --> 21:57.060
Is it big enough
for a body?

22:03.064 --> 22:05.008
So this is
a crime scene.

22:16.052 --> 22:19.044
Some of these the Youngs used
to keep their stolen gear in--

22:19.044 --> 22:22.044
mainly electronics,
sometimes drugs,

22:22.044 --> 22:23.096
sometimes cars.

22:23.096 --> 22:27.088
That was Brannon's
special skill-- cars.

22:27.088 --> 22:31.020
He'd put, like, a little track
on a top-end car

22:31.020 --> 22:33.064
that the Youngs
wanted him to nick.

22:33.064 --> 22:35.020
When it was parked
somewhere quiet,

22:35.020 --> 22:36.092
he'd move in,
and do the job.

22:36.092 --> 22:39.072
He was always so pleased
with himself.

22:39.072 --> 22:42.080
"Let me check on Fred.
Where's Fred?

22:42.080 --> 22:44.064
See if Fred's
got a result."

22:47.016 --> 22:48.072
Tosser.

22:48.072 --> 22:50.080
I don't think even Bran
would keep a kid

22:50.080 --> 22:52.060
in a dock
in one of these.

23:00.016 --> 23:01.092
What is this?

23:01.092 --> 23:04.068
Skene Street.

23:04.068 --> 23:07.096
It's mainly just used
by kids joyriding.

23:07.096 --> 23:11.028
Oh, you wanker!

23:11.028 --> 23:13.024
Sorry about that, ladies.

23:13.024 --> 23:14.088
It's all right.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.048
Little bit
of excitement.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.060
Who do you think that guy
was delivering to back there?

23:33.060 --> 23:35.076
Steve. There he is.
Pull over.

23:45.072 --> 23:47.020
Hey.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.052
Who did you
just deliver to?

23:48.052 --> 23:49.096
None of your business, lad.

23:54.036 --> 23:56.060
Please.
I'm asking politely.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.092
It's still none of
your business.

23:57.092 --> 24:00.036
It's not a crime
to deliver food, is it?

24:00.036 --> 24:03.016
And can you at least tell us
what you delivered?

24:03.016 --> 24:04.056
Please.

24:07.048 --> 24:10.088
I got a cheeseburger,
Diet Coke, and two chips,

24:10.088 --> 24:13.020
and a kid's meal
with a strawberry milkshake.

24:13.020 --> 24:14.092
What are you doing?
- I want to talk to you.

24:14.092 --> 24:16.028
Hey. Come here.

24:21.084 --> 24:23.012
Sarah.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.020
It's not her?

24:36.020 --> 24:38.012
It's not human.

24:38.012 --> 24:39.048
It's a dog.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.096
She's not here.

25:05.064 --> 25:08.056
I'm sorry, Claire.

25:08.056 --> 25:11.088
Who was in there?

25:11.088 --> 25:15.056
Someone had buried
a dog.

25:15.056 --> 25:17.044
I'm sorry.
- A dog?

25:19.088 --> 25:21.048
And you're sorry.

25:24.008 --> 25:25.080
Should I be sorry?

25:25.080 --> 25:27.012
I don't know.

25:27.012 --> 25:29.004
No, I shouldn't.

25:29.004 --> 25:32.032
Because it means
she could still be alive.

25:32.032 --> 25:33.092
You were wrong
about this--

25:33.092 --> 25:35.092
just like you're probably wrong
about Adrian Stephenson.

25:35.092 --> 25:38.052
I'm so sorry to have
put you through this.

25:38.052 --> 25:39.080
Let me take you home.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.000
No.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.032
I have my car.

25:47.044 --> 25:48.084
I know how hard
you're trying.

25:54.072 --> 25:57.020
- Steve.
<i>- We located Brannon.</i>

25:57.020 --> 25:58.044
You're kidding.
Where?

25:58.044 --> 26:00.004
Just 2 miles
from Farlow Nick.

26:00.004 --> 26:03.008
- And what about Skye?
- 99% certain she's with him.

26:03.008 --> 26:05.008
Fed is coordinating
with Firearms Command,

26:05.008 --> 26:06.068
and I'll be taking Lizzie
and Cathy back to Farlow.

26:06.068 --> 26:08.096
There's a briefing in 30.
Can you make it?

26:08.096 --> 26:12.068
I'm on my way.

26:12.068 --> 26:14.008
You all know why
we're here--

26:14.008 --> 26:16.036
suspected murderer,
child kidnaper,

26:16.036 --> 26:18.020
and video star
Matt Brannon.

26:18.020 --> 26:20.040
He's been located here--
a body shop

26:20.040 --> 26:22.024
once owned by
the Young family.

26:22.024 --> 26:24.076
Intelligence-- a food delivery
40 minutes ago

26:24.076 --> 26:27.036
suggests the girl, Skye,
is with Brannon.

26:27.036 --> 26:28.072
Over to you, Lucas.

26:28.072 --> 26:30.080
Inspector Lucas Stanning,
Firearms Command.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.044
Because of the threats
Brannon's made,

26:32.044 --> 26:35.068
we've been advised negotiation
is unlikely to succeed.

26:35.068 --> 26:38.012
Therefore, we have authorization
from Gold Commander

26:38.012 --> 26:39.072
to proceed with
the dig-out.

26:39.072 --> 26:41.028
Do we know
they're still in there?

26:41.028 --> 26:43.060
We had a parabolic mic
on the place 10 minutes ago.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.032
The kid's watching
"Shaun the Sheep."

26:45.032 --> 26:48.028
RVP is here,
car park on Crip Street.

26:48.028 --> 26:51.068
We'll do a final over the bonnet
briefing for the entry and pip.

26:51.068 --> 26:53.072
Homicide will be with us
to make the arrests,

26:53.072 --> 26:55.016
gather evidence.

26:55.016 --> 26:56.044
Do you have a female detective
for the girl?

26:56.044 --> 26:57.096
Sarah Collins.
Are you here?

27:00.036 --> 27:02.048
DI Shaw's giving us officers
for the cordon.

27:02.048 --> 27:04.064
500 yards
in every direction.

27:04.064 --> 27:07.068
Any questions?

27:07.068 --> 27:10.000
Right.
the RVP.

27:27.076 --> 27:31.068
<i>Bravo team ready.
Charlie team ready.</i>

27:31.068 --> 27:34.032
Bravo, Charlie,
clear to move.

27:55.084 --> 27:57.048
<i>Alpha team ready.</i>

27:57.048 --> 28:00.044
Alpha, Bravo,
Charlie, go.

28:30.024 --> 28:32.044
<i>Golf.
The place is empty.</i>

29:25.088 --> 29:30.048
Stanning thinks between you
calling in the location,

29:30.048 --> 29:32.096
Firearms pulling up surveillance,

29:32.096 --> 29:35.068
there was
a 20-minute window.

29:35.068 --> 29:37.092
That's when he
got out.

29:37.092 --> 29:39.084
Then he must have been
tipped off.

29:39.084 --> 29:41.044
Who else knew
apart from us?

29:45.020 --> 29:46.064
Silver lining--

29:46.064 --> 29:49.032
the little shit's
running out of places to hide.

29:49.032 --> 29:51.000
Get some rest.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.044
Back at it
first thing tomorrow.

29:53.044 --> 29:57.024
I hear your dig
didn't pan out.

29:57.024 --> 29:58.096
I'm afraid not.

29:58.096 --> 30:02.008
And where does that
leave us?

30:02.008 --> 30:04.044
Honestly...

30:04.044 --> 30:05.076
I don't know.

30:36.056 --> 30:37.092
Arif.

30:37.092 --> 30:39.040
Liz.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.016
I'm watching
Colin Ryle.

30:41.016 --> 30:42.064
What? Why?

30:42.064 --> 30:44.008
He should be on his shift
at Farlow.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.076
Instead, he's 10 miles
from the station.

30:45.076 --> 30:48.032
Looks like he's waiting
for someone.

30:48.032 --> 30:49.064
Where are you?

31:24.028 --> 31:25.068
<i>Hello?</i>

31:25.068 --> 31:29.024
Hi. It's Sarah--
Sarah Collins.

31:29.024 --> 31:31.036
<i>Sarah.</i>

31:31.036 --> 31:33.072
<i>This is a surprise.</i>

31:33.072 --> 31:38.088
Um, I was wondering if we could
maybe get that drink.

31:38.088 --> 31:40.024
<i>Okay.</i>

31:40.024 --> 31:41.092
<i>You can't be that far
from me.</i>

31:41.092 --> 31:45.064
<i>Do you want to come over?
Or I can come to you?</i>

31:45.064 --> 31:47.000
Yes.

31:52.056 --> 31:54.052
Where is he?

31:54.052 --> 31:56.092
Straight from Farlow
to here.

31:56.092 --> 32:00.028
He's got two phones.
Keeps looking at them.

32:00.028 --> 32:03.096
You think he tipped
Brannon off?

32:03.096 --> 32:06.000
Yeah. I do.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.052
What do we do?

32:07.052 --> 32:08.084
Liz?

32:18.040 --> 32:20.060
What the hell?
Get away from me!

32:20.060 --> 32:21.088
The fuck are you doing,
Colin?

32:21.088 --> 32:23.036
Get away!
You'll blow it.

32:23.036 --> 32:24.080
You're gonna
ruin everything.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.004
You tipped him off,
didn't you?

32:26.004 --> 32:28.000
- No.
- I've been watching you.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.048
Ever since Brannon was spotted,
you've been wetting your pants.

32:30.048 --> 32:31.068
Is he your best mate,
or something?

32:31.068 --> 32:33.004
They were gonna
kill him.

32:33.004 --> 32:34.060
You arranged to meet him,
didn't you,

32:34.060 --> 32:36.040
so he can
hand himself in?

32:36.040 --> 32:38.004
Look,
I'm gonna talk to him.

32:38.004 --> 32:39.064
I understand him.

32:39.064 --> 32:41.092
And I've got stuff here.
Stuff for Skye that he wanted.

32:41.092 --> 32:44.036
Look, he's coming any second,
so will you just piss off?

32:44.036 --> 32:46.016
Don't kid yourself.
He's not coming.

32:46.016 --> 32:47.088
Well, maybe he got
held up.

32:50.096 --> 32:53.056
Look. Look.

32:53.056 --> 32:57.080
Please, will you just go, or--
or I'm so... I'm so--

32:57.080 --> 32:59.032
Fucked.

32:59.032 --> 33:02.084
Yeah.
You really are.

33:02.084 --> 33:05.052
Colin Ryle, I'm arresting you
for assisting an offender.

33:05.052 --> 33:07.068
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense...

33:07.068 --> 33:09.040
Women.

33:09.040 --> 33:12.076
You got it all your own way,
now, haven't you?

33:12.076 --> 33:14.088
Colin...

33:14.088 --> 33:18.044
if you know where Brannon is,
please just tell us.

33:18.044 --> 33:21.036
I want a lawyer
and a Fed rep.

33:46.072 --> 33:48.012
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:48.012 --> 33:50.004
- Come in. Come in.
- Thanks.

33:53.080 --> 33:55.052
Got this just in case.
- Oh.

33:55.052 --> 33:58.016
That's really kind.
Thank you.

33:58.016 --> 33:59.068
Sorry about the mess.

33:59.068 --> 34:02.048
Um... corkscrew.

34:04.056 --> 34:07.016
And some... glasses.

34:09.052 --> 34:13.072
Sorry.
Could you give me a sec?

34:13.072 --> 34:15.040
Something has just
come up.

34:15.040 --> 34:18.024
It's okay.
I can find the necessary.

34:18.024 --> 34:20.040
Thanks.
Just half a sec.

34:22.092 --> 34:24.048
It's about
a missing girl.

34:31.060 --> 34:35.024
- There you go.
- Oh.

34:35.024 --> 34:37.016
Cheers.
- Cheers.

34:43.008 --> 34:44.060
Just half a sec.

34:56.032 --> 34:57.080
Where are we?

34:57.080 --> 35:01.000
Just [indistinct] place.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.072
She forgot to leave
the keys.

35:10.008 --> 35:11.044
In. In.

35:20.064 --> 35:22.060
Is there a bedroom?

35:22.060 --> 35:24.016
Of course there is, sweetheart.

35:34.032 --> 35:35.088
What are the grounds
for arrest?

35:35.088 --> 35:38.004
The grounds for arrest is that,
having become suspicious

35:38.004 --> 35:40.076
of his activities,
I followed him to a location

35:40.076 --> 35:43.024
where he was waiting to meet
Matt Brannon.

35:43.024 --> 35:46.040
He admitted at the scene
that this was his intention,

35:46.040 --> 35:47.084
and that he had warned
Matt Brannon

35:47.084 --> 35:50.000
that the police
had identified his hideout.

35:53.032 --> 35:55.004
Well, he's gonna bring down
a world of shit

35:55.004 --> 35:57.004
on this station,
.

35:57.004 --> 35:58.048
Mm-hmm.

35:58.048 --> 36:00.036
But you two did good.

36:00.036 --> 36:02.004
Real good.

36:02.004 --> 36:04.096
I want to make sure
the right people know about it.

36:04.096 --> 36:07.068
- It was mainly Arif.
- Yeah.

36:07.068 --> 36:09.072
But also you.

36:20.028 --> 36:21.096
Well done.
Give that a little whisk-up.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.088
Good girl.

36:23.088 --> 36:25.032
There we go.

36:28.008 --> 36:29.088
There you go.
Do you want lemon?

36:29.088 --> 36:31.092
- Yes, please.
- Oh, well done.

36:49.032 --> 36:52.020
What are you
looking at?

36:52.020 --> 36:55.020
Oh, I'm just checking on
my pal Fred.

36:55.020 --> 36:56.076
Just seeing where he is
right now.

37:02.056 --> 37:04.024
No. Don't stop.

37:07.012 --> 37:09.012
Don't you want
some pancakes?

37:17.076 --> 37:19.048
Come on.
Eat up, sweetheart.

37:43.020 --> 37:44.064
So, the car park
<i>was</i> being dug up

37:44.064 --> 37:47.012
at the same time as
the tree planting.

37:47.012 --> 37:49.008
Can you meet me there?

37:49.008 --> 37:51.060
Thank you.
I'm so grateful.

37:51.060 --> 37:55.020
Yeah.
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:55.020 --> 37:56.076
I've just got
two more calls to make

37:56.076 --> 37:58.036
to set up something
for tomorrow morning.

38:03.076 --> 38:08.040
No. I'm gonna go.
You're busy.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.044
Please don't.
I won't be long.

38:10.044 --> 38:12.016
Yeah, you will.

38:12.016 --> 38:13.064
And when you're done,

38:13.064 --> 38:14.084
your head's gonna be in
whatever you're doing.

38:14.084 --> 38:16.012
It's not gonna
be here.

38:18.008 --> 38:20.056
I'm sorry.

38:20.056 --> 38:22.088
I just hope you were
as obsessed as this

38:22.088 --> 38:25.040
when you were trying to find out
why Farah Mehenni died.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.032
Yes, Sarah.

39:23.032 --> 39:25.012
I'm at Morville Park, sir.

39:25.012 --> 39:26.072
There's another area
we should scan.

39:26.072 --> 39:28.024
You've got to
be joking.

39:28.024 --> 39:29.092
<i>Just spoken to the groundsman
back then.</i>

39:29.092 --> 39:32.032
He says the council dug up
the car park to put in drains

39:32.032 --> 39:33.088
exactly the same time
that Stephenson

39:33.088 --> 39:35.072
was making
his Diana memorial.

39:35.072 --> 39:37.000
<i>Sarah.</i>

39:37.000 --> 39:38.044
It's a much better place
to bury a body--

39:38.044 --> 39:39.080
less far to move it,
and easier.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.028
<i>Sarah, stop.</i>

39:41.028 --> 39:43.008
<i>We've got a major cock-up
at Farlow.</i>

39:43.008 --> 39:45.036
<i>It looks like one of their</i>
officers has tipped off Brannon.

39:45.036 --> 39:46.068
<i>The press haven't got
ahold of it yet,</i>

39:46.068 --> 39:48.028
<i>but you can bet your ass
they will.</i>

39:48.028 --> 39:50.012
I have to say, what the hell
is going on at Farlow?

39:50.012 --> 39:52.040
First, the Portland Tower mess,
and now this--

39:52.040 --> 39:53.088
tipping off
a murderer.

39:53.088 --> 39:55.040
What sort of place
is Shaw running?

39:55.040 --> 39:56.092
Sarah,
let me stop you there.

39:56.092 --> 39:59.040
You're not DSI.
You're Homicide.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.076
We've got a killer
on the run.

40:00.076 --> 40:02.044
So forget
digging up car parks,

40:02.044 --> 40:04.000
<i>and get yourself
back here.</i>

40:04.000 --> 40:06.016
Sir, Tania Mills
is a homicide, too.

40:06.016 --> 40:09.008
<i>It's a small area.
It won't take any time to scan.</i>

40:09.008 --> 40:11.004
Are you deaf?
I said "no."

40:11.004 --> 40:13.064
<i>You haven't even proved that
Stevenson was abusing Tania.</i>

40:13.064 --> 40:17.020
Then why is he so jumpy,
threatening us with lawsuits?

40:17.020 --> 40:19.008
If even half what Elaine found
is true,

40:19.008 --> 40:21.048
he's as much a sex offender
as Walker is.

40:21.048 --> 40:24.004
And why are we scared of him?
Because he's posh?

40:24.004 --> 40:26.088
<i>He made the groundsman give him
his own key to the car park.</i>

40:26.088 --> 40:29.068
He could have got access to it
any time, day or night.

40:29.068 --> 40:31.056
<i>She's here, sir.</i>

40:31.056 --> 40:34.020
Tania's here.

40:34.020 --> 40:38.020
<i>Okay. Do it.</i>

40:38.020 --> 40:40.048
<i>Mr. Stanley told a meeting
of his constituents</i>

40:40.048 --> 40:42.012
<i>that he didn't want
these allegations,</i>

40:42.012 --> 40:43.084
<i>which he firmly denies,</i>

40:43.084 --> 40:46.068
<i>to distract from the important
work of government.</i>

40:46.068 --> 40:50.000
<i>Now to the latest on
the Matthew Brannon manhunt.</i>

40:50.000 --> 40:53.016
<i>After a raid on an address
in south London yesterday</i>

40:53.016 --> 40:55.012
<i>ended in failure,
there have been claims</i>

40:55.012 --> 40:57.004
<i>that Brannon was tipped off
by someone--</i>

40:57.004 --> 41:00.032
<i>perhaps even from
within the police.</i>

41:00.032 --> 41:03.024
- I don't want to hear it.
- Well, maybe you should.

41:03.024 --> 41:04.072
What's that
supposed to mean?

41:04.072 --> 41:06.072
All the girls had trouble
with Colin.

41:06.072 --> 41:08.060
I just thought he was
some harmless idiot.

41:08.060 --> 41:10.064
But he wasn't harmless,
was he?

41:10.064 --> 41:12.092
So you're saying I should have
done something, then?

41:12.092 --> 41:17.040
Well, Hadley did.
Hadley kept him in line.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.016
Then maybe I should have
done something.

41:19.016 --> 41:20.048
I'm sorry.

41:23.096 --> 41:25.096
But I don't care, Lizzie.

41:25.096 --> 41:29.016
I don't care about Colin.

41:29.016 --> 41:30.040
Yeah, he's a disgrace,

41:30.040 --> 41:31.072
and I hope they fucking
bury him.

41:31.072 --> 41:34.064
But I don't care.
We've got to move on.

41:34.064 --> 41:37.036
So what, we should just
pretend like it didn't happen?

41:37.036 --> 41:38.080
Are you kidding?

41:40.096 --> 41:42.072
I was offered a job
the other day

41:42.072 --> 41:45.048
to go after
a real bad guy--

41:45.048 --> 41:46.084
one of the untouchables.

41:46.084 --> 41:48.088
And to bring someone
like that down,

41:48.088 --> 41:51.064
that's what I
care about.

41:51.064 --> 41:54.048
You're leaving Farlow?

41:54.048 --> 41:55.072
Yeah.

42:04.056 --> 42:05.096
You could join me.

42:08.008 --> 42:11.012
Going after the big fish, Lizzie,

42:11.012 --> 42:12.092
it's like...

42:12.092 --> 42:14.056
It's like
going to war.

42:14.056 --> 42:16.080
You know, you plan for months,
you react in seconds.

42:16.080 --> 42:21.036
Lives on the line.
No doubt. No hesitation.

42:21.036 --> 42:23.004
And don't you want to be
part of that?

42:25.060 --> 42:27.048
Yeah.

42:27.048 --> 42:28.088
Yeah, I do.

42:41.080 --> 42:44.092
<i>This is Kieran Shaw.
Leave a message.</i>

44:21.016 --> 44:23.000
Who did this?
