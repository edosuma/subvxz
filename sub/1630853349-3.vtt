00:46.240 --> 00:47.960
This is awesome, man!

00:48.520 --> 00:50.480
I've always wanted to be kidnapped.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.360
It's been one of my dreams.

00:52.440 --> 00:56.400
So bucket list, bitch.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.600
You guys mind telling me
where we're going?

00:59.200 --> 01:03.280
No? Okay, cool.
Spoils the mystery. Yep, respect.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.040
Apply the blindfold, please.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.360
Blindfolds!

01:06.440 --> 01:08.560
Okay. Yes, please.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.680
My safe word is "excelsior."

01:13.160 --> 01:15.000
Oh, it's the pilot.

01:15.080 --> 01:18.640
Why is it on the pilot?
Is this like a <i>Fifty Shades </i>type deal?

01:18.720 --> 01:21.640
No, I'm just saying
if you want me to fuck the pilot,

01:21.720 --> 01:25.920
I'll totally fuck the pilot.
I fucked a lot of pilots in my day.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.400
Helicopter pilots, airplane pilots,

01:29.480 --> 01:31.920
actors during pilot season.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.040
Remote landing sequence has begun.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.680
Ah!

01:38.760 --> 01:39.760
Whoo!

01:39.840 --> 01:40.960
Nice!

01:41.600 --> 01:43.880
I have such a boner right now!

01:55.400 --> 01:57.920
How you doin', playboy?

01:58.560 --> 01:59.720
Who set me up?

02:00.520 --> 02:02.920
It was Bezos, right?

02:06.880 --> 02:08.400
Wow!

02:08.480 --> 02:10.160
I'm digging this music.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.800
Oh my God, look at you.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.800
Look at this. Getting taller.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.720
And then to you.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.240
Adorable!

02:19.320 --> 02:21.160
Oh!

02:21.240 --> 02:23.680
I'm kidding.
I'll see you at the food court.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.840
Oh! Whoa! Oh, oh, oh!

02:27.920 --> 02:30.000
Okay. Okay. Mmm.

02:31.040 --> 02:31.920
We are the--

02:32.000 --> 02:33.520
Uh… Oh, the Illuminati?

02:33.600 --> 02:35.400
No, no, no. We are the--

02:35.480 --> 02:37.360
Oh, uh, you're the Masons.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.240
The fucking Pentaverate!

02:39.320 --> 02:40.800
The Pentaverate, asshole.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.360
Yeah. He's a total schmuck.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.480
The Penta-what-the-fuck?

02:47.480 --> 02:49.120
<i>In 1347--</i>

02:49.200 --> 02:51.600
<i>Now, what did I tell you?</i>
<i>Don't skip the intro!</i>

02:51.680 --> 02:53.840
<i>It's not just</i>
<i>a cut-and-paste job, you know?</i>

02:53.920 --> 02:57.480
<i>When you hire Jeremy Irons,</i>
<i>you get a bespoke performance,</i>

02:57.560 --> 02:59.720
<i>not just any old shit.</i>

02:59.800 --> 03:01.560
<i>So… </i>

03:01.640 --> 03:05.640
<i>…by now we know the show's about five men</i>
<i>and a secret society called</i>

03:06.440 --> 03:08.360
<i>the Pentaverate, who are nice.</i>

03:08.440 --> 03:09.320
<i>Well, four men now,</i>

03:09.400 --> 03:11.920
<i>because someone went</i>
<i>and killed Professor Clark. </i>

03:12.000 --> 03:13.520
<i>Didn't see that coming, did you?</i>

03:13.600 --> 03:15.400
<i>No, nor did I, to be honest with you.</i>

03:15.480 --> 03:16.600
<i>Fucked me right up.</i>

03:16.680 --> 03:19.400
<i>Anyhoo, on with the show.</i>

03:24.080 --> 03:25.840
<i>Good morning, Pentaverate!</i>

03:25.920 --> 03:30.000
<i>The time is 6:00 a.m. in New York,</i>
<i>12:00 p.m. in Dubrovnik.</i>

03:30.080 --> 03:33.160
<i>A reminder, The Meadows</i>
<i>is just one day away.</i>

03:33.240 --> 03:34.920
<i>I'm Maria Menounos.</i>

03:38.000 --> 03:39.280
Wake up, sleepyhead.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.400
<i>...where they fashion condoms</i>
<i>made out of corn husks</i>

03:45.480 --> 03:47.240
<i>and exchange names if you tell them…</i>

03:48.360 --> 03:51.280
Ooh! You know, if you're sick,
you should go see a doctor.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.320
This one's a firecracker.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.480
Just fucking with ya.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.560
Ten-hut!

04:00.640 --> 04:04.040
Up and at 'em, you sorry sacks of shit!

04:06.800 --> 04:11.640
What an all-singing,
all-dancing Broadway shit show!

04:11.720 --> 04:14.760
And you, Lefty. You stand up straight.

04:14.840 --> 04:18.000
It's like watching Humpty-Dumpty
trying to un-fuck himself.

04:18.080 --> 04:20.600
Hey, don't call him that!

04:21.560 --> 04:25.240
Well, well, well, what do we have here?

04:25.320 --> 04:28.360
Little Lord Fuckleroy.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.320
Where were you born, son?

04:31.400 --> 04:33.160
Well, actually, I was born in Toronto.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.160
No.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.400
You were born in your mother's ass.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.760
Well, that's less than kind.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.080
And impossible.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.080
You're lucky
I don't throw you in the cube.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.880
You want to tell me how to do my job?

04:46.960 --> 04:48.600
You want to wear this sash?

04:48.680 --> 04:49.520
No, sir.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.800
You get out here, and you choke yourself.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.160
You want me to choke myself?

04:54.240 --> 04:55.560
Legally, I can't.

04:55.640 --> 04:59.040
But you can choke yourself.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.360
Let go of me, or I will end you.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.880
Mercy.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.560
What kind of bullshit was that?

05:13.640 --> 05:15.360
It's called Defendo.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.080
-Defendo?
-Yeah, it's Canadian martial arts.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.040
I learned it in the Canadian Army.

05:21.120 --> 05:25.360
I use your strength against you
by hitting your pressure points.

05:25.440 --> 05:28.840
I was just trying to stick up
for my fellow Liechtenstein Guard.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.280
Hmm.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.320
All right, you dolphin lickers,

05:34.400 --> 05:39.280
this man here is gonna teach you
the Canadian art of Defendo.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.400
He already taught you one lesson.

05:41.480 --> 05:45.200
The Liechtenstein Guard
are a band of brothers.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.120
Are we clear?

05:47.200 --> 05:48.760
Pikeman, yes, Pikeman.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.720
I said, are we clear?

05:50.800 --> 05:52.960
Pikeman, yes, Pikeman!

05:54.800 --> 05:57.280
I'm gonna go drop the kids off
at the pool.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.240
As you were.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.280
Hoo-ah!

06:06.000 --> 06:08.240
-Thank you.
-Hey, you're welcome. It was nothing.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.960
You know,
it's just a thing called Defendo.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.680
<i>Welcome aboard. We're happy to have you.</i>

06:14.760 --> 06:18.320
Still dreamy after all these years,
am I right?

06:18.400 --> 06:20.720
I'd pay good money to have that face.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.640
Truth!

06:22.720 --> 06:25.560
<i>You're joining the Pentaverate</i>
<i>at an exciting time,</i>

06:25.640 --> 06:27.800
<i>when we no longer use scalding</i>

06:29.080 --> 06:30.080
<i>or maiming,</i>

06:30.880 --> 06:33.840
<i>but, of course, if you're a traitor,</i>
<i>we will put your fucking head on a pike.</i>

06:35.600 --> 06:38.000
<i> I mean,</i>
<i>come on, it just makes sense.</i>

06:40.000 --> 06:41.400
<i>And remember,</i>

06:41.480 --> 06:44.320
<i>the Pentaverate must never be exposed.</i>

06:44.400 --> 06:47.520
The Pentaverate
must never be exposed.

06:47.600 --> 06:52.120
So now you know who we are
and how we operate. Any questions?

06:52.200 --> 06:56.200
Nope. Got it, man.
I am super psyched to be here.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.680
And head on a pike?

06:57.760 --> 06:59.120
Nice touch.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.000
-Thank you.
-Well, that was easy.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.360
You picked a good one, Bruce.

07:02.440 --> 07:06.000
And you know you must eschew
your previous life, Mr. Cho?

07:06.080 --> 07:08.880
Oh yeah, copy that. I have some casinos,

07:08.960 --> 07:11.040
I'm a billionaire, but I'm bored.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.720
I'm in a midlife crisis.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.520
It's either join the Penta-Verdes
or join a gym.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.760
-You know what I mean?
-And your fake death.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.320
-MENTOR?

07:21.400 --> 07:24.760
-<i>Check this shit out.</i>

07:24.840 --> 07:27.040
Died with a hooker and an eight ball!

07:27.120 --> 07:28.880
Nailed it! Oh!

07:28.960 --> 07:33.320
Professor Clark's death,
however, was very real.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.720
There's a deepening sense of crisis
running through these walls.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.920
One hesitates to mention

07:41.200 --> 07:42.840
the Demetrius Protocols.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.160
-The Demetrius Protocols?

07:45.240 --> 07:46.680
The Demetrius Protocols?

07:46.760 --> 07:48.400
The Demetrius Protocols?

07:49.680 --> 07:50.800
Sounds like fun.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.440
No! No! No!

07:52.520 --> 07:55.240
Demetrius Protocols is doomsday plan

07:55.320 --> 07:58.240
should Pentaverate fall
into nefarious hands.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.760
Then we all kill ourselves
using our cyanide pills.

08:00.840 --> 08:04.480
-Yeah.
-Is not good.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.680
Oh, I get it.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.720
A guy died, so you've got
some human resources issues.

08:08.800 --> 08:13.760
But don't worry, because this crazy,
rich Asian is ready to rock and roll!

08:13.840 --> 08:15.400
Are ya ready to rock?

08:21.400 --> 08:24.280
I have no idea what he's saying.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.840
The man's a nutter.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.640
<i>I'm Maria Menounos for Pentaverate TV.</i>

08:31.720 --> 08:33.920
<i>Always current, always on.</i>

08:34.760 --> 08:38.520
<i>We pay our respects</i>
<i>to the late professor Hobart Clark,</i>

08:38.600 --> 08:41.240
<i>the most recent initiate</i>
<i>to the Pentaverate</i>

08:41.320 --> 08:43.920
<i>and many members' first Black friend.</i>

08:44.000 --> 08:46.800
<i>Professor, we hardly knew you.</i>

08:49.200 --> 08:52.440
<i>The Pentaverate has…</i>
<i> …a potential new member.</i>

08:52.520 --> 08:53.920
<i>Skip Cho.</i>

08:54.000 --> 08:55.880
<i>Owning the largest casino in Asia,</i>

08:55.960 --> 08:58.320
<i>this billionaire is a real high roller</i>

08:58.400 --> 09:02.360
<i>when it comes to understanding</i>
<i>the chaos theory of weather patterns.</i>

09:02.440 --> 09:05.360
<i>Climate change is about to get solved.</i>

09:05.440 --> 09:07.520
<i>This shit is getting real.</i>

09:07.600 --> 09:08.600
<i>I'm Maria Menounos.</i>

09:09.520 --> 09:11.080
Here we are at the Pentaverate.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.800
There's plenty of things to do,
whether you're in the Liechtenstein Guard

09:14.880 --> 09:15.960
or whether you've--

09:16.040 --> 09:18.760
-<i>Ken! Ken! Are you alone?</i>
Yes.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.720
Ken, when we meet tonight,

09:20.800 --> 09:23.320
I'll off-load the SD card
and get the footage to Mrs. Snee.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.240
-We're gonna get your job back!

09:25.920 --> 09:27.320
Ken! Ken!

09:27.400 --> 09:30.600
We have to see
the Pentaverate members themselves!

09:30.680 --> 09:32.280
I just haven't had a chance to.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.080
You have to find a way to get
into that fucking main chamber, kid!

09:36.160 --> 09:38.480
<i>There's gotta be someone</i>
<i>who can get you in.</i>

09:38.560 --> 09:41.880
Yeoman Doll, you know what you did today?

09:41.960 --> 09:43.800
-<i>Ken, who is that?</i>

09:43.880 --> 09:45.080
I can't say.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.680
You can't say?

09:46.760 --> 09:47.960
Then I'll tell ya.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.800
-Hell, you impressed me!
-Thank you, sir.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.800
<i>That sounds like your guy.</i>
<i>Over and out.</i>

09:54.800 --> 09:56.760
You stood up for one of your own.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.200
A true Liechtenstein Guard.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.920
I like the cut of your jib.

10:01.520 --> 10:02.920
You come with me.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.240
I've got a special job for you.

10:05.320 --> 10:06.960
-Hoo-ah!

10:10.480 --> 10:14.280
Strangely,
both men had brown eyes,

10:14.360 --> 10:17.680
which postmortem, turned blue.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.120
Ergo--

10:20.200 --> 10:21.880
-Yes, Maester?
-No, I'm saying "therefore."

10:22.880 --> 10:28.040
I can determine cause of death
to be poison.

10:28.120 --> 10:32.760
Most likely sap of tree
native to Dubrovnik,

10:32.840 --> 10:34.560
the Donette tree.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.480
Highly poisonous.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.720
The Donette's sap,
it, uh, first make victims thirsty.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.640
Then Donette makes you
have chest palpitations.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.520
And finally, at death,

10:50.520 --> 10:54.200
Donette makes your brown eyes blue.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.480
"Donette make your brown eyes blue"?

10:57.560 --> 10:58.840
Exactly.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.560
That is what Donette does.

11:02.640 --> 11:03.560
Okay.

11:03.640 --> 11:04.560
-And so--
-Yes, Mae--

11:04.640 --> 11:05.960
No, no, no!

11:06.040 --> 11:08.240
Again, I was just saying, "And so."

11:09.120 --> 11:12.080
I specifically hit the "D" very hard.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.280
So…

11:18.080 --> 11:19.800
…one of you

11:19.880 --> 11:25.720
is the murderer… er… er… er…

11:27.840 --> 11:30.120
Any one of you

11:30.800 --> 11:35.040
could have murdered Jason Eccleston

11:35.720 --> 11:38.480
and Professor Clark.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.120
Mishu.

11:41.880 --> 11:45.000
You are familiar with my book of poison.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.760
This is not fair!

11:46.840 --> 11:48.400
Every time poison is mentioned,

11:48.480 --> 11:51.680
it's always,
"Blame the Russian, blame the Russian."

11:51.760 --> 11:53.280
Yeah, that's just crazy.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.720
Go piss up a rope.

11:56.680 --> 12:00.920
Bruce, aren't fake deaths your specialty?

12:01.640 --> 12:02.480
No.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.640
I loved Jason.

12:05.480 --> 12:08.040
Who do you think gave him
his first companion doll?

12:08.120 --> 12:08.960
Me.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.160
Took me hours
to blow that fucking thing up.

12:14.280 --> 12:15.360
Ooh.

12:15.440 --> 12:16.960
Lordington,

12:17.040 --> 12:22.000
new members are a threat to your position
as Centralis, are they not?

12:22.080 --> 12:23.480
No, they are not.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.760
I've been leading this organization
for over 50 years.

12:28.360 --> 12:29.600
Not through guile

12:30.200 --> 12:31.720
but through skill.

12:31.800 --> 12:32.840
Shep.

12:33.920 --> 12:39.560
You and, uh, Jason were,
uh, hey, how you say, libertine.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.360
Sure, we got stoned together.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.880
But when's the last time
you saw stoned people fight?

12:44.960 --> 12:46.200
We didn't fight.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.160
We ate.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.520
Woman,

12:50.640 --> 12:56.400
you had very friendly relationship
with Professor Clark.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.680
Are you familiar with black widow spider?

13:00.760 --> 13:03.360
Are you familiar with slut-shaming?

13:05.840 --> 13:08.000
Oh, uh, excuse me. Um…

13:08.080 --> 13:09.880
What about me? Could have been me.

13:09.960 --> 13:13.240
Maybe, like, what if there was, like,
a time machine, and I just looped around--

13:13.320 --> 13:14.960
Don't bait the Maester.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.520
I pluck your eyes out.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.640
Oh, so, um…

13:21.720 --> 13:25.840
so if I Maester-bait, I will go blind?

13:35.480 --> 13:36.640
I… I don't get it.

13:36.720 --> 13:40.400
Okay, you know what, never mind.
It's just… it's a rough room.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.600
Down there's the office
of the Fimbra Manus.

13:45.680 --> 13:50.000
The Fimbra are like the hands
of the Pentaverate in the outside world.

13:50.080 --> 13:54.080
Most fortune-teller shops,
really Fimbra outposts.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.000
Ah.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.640
Now let me show you something
that'll blow your mind.

13:57.720 --> 13:58.600
Where are we?

13:58.680 --> 14:01.360
It's the Pentaverate Hall
of Achievements.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.800
Galileo's telescope

14:03.880 --> 14:06.520
and Gutenberg's movable type.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.160
And there's the polio vaccine.

14:09.240 --> 14:13.880
But that all pales in comparison
to the Pentaverate's greatest achievement,

14:13.960 --> 14:16.120
which is right there.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.560
What is it?

14:20.640 --> 14:22.520
It's a ball bearing.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.840
-That's it?
-What do you mean, "That's it?"

14:30.920 --> 14:32.840
Show a little respect, kid.

14:33.440 --> 14:39.320
Without the ball bearing, there'd be
no cars, railroads, aircraft, or tanks.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.520
Hell, the US Air Force lost more men

14:41.600 --> 14:44.160
bombing the Nazi ball bearing factory
in Schweinfurt

14:44.240 --> 14:46.000
than almost anywhere else.

14:47.080 --> 14:52.120
My point is the Pentaverate
is like this here ball bearing.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.200
Might seem small,

14:54.960 --> 14:56.440
but without it,

14:56.520 --> 14:57.840
nothing works.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.040
I believe in the Liechtenstein Guard, Ken,

15:02.920 --> 15:05.480
'cause I believe in the Pentaverate.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.760
But I'm gonna give it
to you straight, kid.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.120
There is something rotten
within the Pentaverate!

15:11.760 --> 15:14.520
I need you to be my eyes and ears.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.760
Thank you, sir.

15:16.400 --> 15:20.040
Come on, I'm putting you
on main chamber duty.

15:24.880 --> 15:25.720
Hmm.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.760
You have an interesting stomach.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.440
Psst. Devin.

15:39.000 --> 15:39.880
That's great.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.640
-Good stuff, buddy.

15:41.720 --> 15:42.680
Give it up, man.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.000
Let <i>Initiato</i> begin.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.720
-Man! Whoo!

15:47.800 --> 15:49.080
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:49.160 --> 15:51.920
I would rather keep
my clothes on, thank you!

15:52.000 --> 15:53.720
Unless I can just Porky Pig it.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.240
Haven't worked out for a while.
I'm a bit self-conscious about my moobs.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.800
Cocaine!

16:01.880 --> 16:03.000
Behold.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.120
Before you is a choice.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.560
The Pentaverate key and the cyanide pill.

16:08.640 --> 16:12.880
Take the key
and join us in protecting the world or--

16:12.960 --> 16:14.680
Key! I'm taking the key.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.120
I mean, I am all in.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.920
The assent
has been uttered. <i>Confirmiato.</i>

16:19.000 --> 16:21.880
<i>Shitaverio!</i>

16:21.960 --> 16:23.880
-Oh, look at this!

16:23.960 --> 16:26.760
-Uh, place the pill inside the key.
-You got it, dude.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.520
Zoink andzoink.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.960
Let us begin <i>Concludiato.</i>

16:32.040 --> 16:33.480
-Yes.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.280
I'm a size 48 small.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.760
This is awesome, man.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.280
You may approach
the Da Vinci lock.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.200
-MENTOR!

16:42.280 --> 16:43.600
<i>Okay, rookie. Listen up.</i>

16:43.680 --> 16:45.880
<i>Now we take</i>
<i>an official vote on your membership.</i>

16:45.960 --> 16:47.680
<i>Here's how it works.</i>

16:47.760 --> 16:49.960
<i>Use your key in the Da Vinci lock to vote.</i>

16:50.040 --> 16:53.520
<i>There's five of youse, so you just need</i>
<i>three votes for a majority.</i>

16:53.600 --> 16:55.960
Quick question.
This key, can I get a spare?

16:56.040 --> 16:57.920
'Cause I'm always losing stuff.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.160
I mean, just last week I lost my, um…

17:00.240 --> 17:02.520
God, what do you call
those things? Daughters.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.080
No! There's only one spare key.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.920
The Parce Clavem,
which is Latin for spare key.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.080
The Parce Clavem is
in the Pentaverate's spiritual birthplace

17:11.160 --> 17:12.120
in Dubrovnik.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.000
This spare key could be used
to gain an extra vote

17:15.080 --> 17:18.440
and shift the balance of power
in the Pentaverate.

17:18.520 --> 17:21.440
Thus, if any existing member
tries to use it,

17:22.120 --> 17:23.400
instant death.

17:23.480 --> 17:25.120
Mmm, spooky!

17:25.200 --> 17:28.360
Okay, <i>claves parare…</i>

17:28.440 --> 17:29.280
Ferrari.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.200
<i>…vobis!</i>

17:30.280 --> 17:31.840
-En garde.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.680
What's happening? What's happening? Is it…

17:38.760 --> 17:40.800
And the lottery winner is…

17:40.880 --> 17:43.240
Oh, man, that guy's got a cataract.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.840
Seriously. He needs to see
an ophthalmologist, like, stat.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.520
<i>Five to nothing vote.</i>

17:47.600 --> 17:51.600
<i>The Pentaverate's newest</i>
<i>and shortest member, Skip Cho.</i>

17:51.680 --> 17:57.720
The 223rd Pentaveration is in <i>sessioniato.</i>

17:58.960 --> 18:01.760
The Pentaverate must never be exposed.

18:01.840 --> 18:02.720
The Pentaverate…

18:02.800 --> 18:05.080
-Pentavera--
-Shh! Not us.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.920
…exposed, yo.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.080
Gentlemen!

18:24.160 --> 18:28.000
The Maester, Mishu, and I have a proposal.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.680
-Maester, if you will.
-Thank you.

18:30.760 --> 18:36.040
I am confident the killer will be found.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.600
However, for extra protection,

18:39.680 --> 18:44.520
I am installing
highly elite security force.

18:44.600 --> 18:49.160
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Red Robes.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.480
Wow!

19:00.840 --> 19:03.000
At least they don't have rocket launchers.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.440
Yeah,

19:09.200 --> 19:10.400
we're fucked.

19:13.240 --> 19:17.200
These men are
lean, mean fighting machines.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.080
Rejects from the German porn industry.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.520
What the hell are you doing?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.040
Who are these men?

19:29.640 --> 19:30.880
The Red Robes.

19:30.960 --> 19:34.040
Face it, the Liechtenstein Guard
aren't cutting it.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.800
Not cutting it, my ass!

19:35.880 --> 19:38.160
These men are highly trained!

19:39.840 --> 19:41.040
Sorry, sorry.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.760
Highly trained?

19:48.280 --> 19:51.840
Pentaverate headquarters
is my jurisdiction!

19:51.920 --> 19:53.680
Yeah, who in the fuck are you?

19:53.760 --> 19:56.760
How dare you talk to a superior that way?

19:56.840 --> 19:58.520
Ooh, I'm so sorry!

19:58.600 --> 20:02.160
Well, I think you confuse me
for somebody who gives a shit.

20:02.240 --> 20:07.120
I am Maester of Dubrovnik,
head of ministry, ergo--

20:07.200 --> 20:10.400
-Yes, Maester!
-Ergo, no! I will kill you!

20:12.480 --> 20:17.400
Therefore, I outrank you,
so you get the fuck out of my face.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.240
Hell, if it wasn't
for this prosthetic taint,

20:19.320 --> 20:20.760
I'd drop ya right here.

20:20.840 --> 20:24.600
Well, you'd better fuck off
when I do my investigation.

20:24.680 --> 20:27.640
Be gone with you.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.520
Gentlemen! Gentleman! Gentleman! Decorum!

20:31.760 --> 20:32.880
Pikeman Higgins,

20:32.960 --> 20:37.120
the Red Robes are here
to offer us extra security.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.600
I suggest you alert your Guard.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.320
You'll pay for this.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.560
All of you!

20:43.640 --> 20:46.200
Good luck with that, fuckboy.

20:46.280 --> 20:49.320
This one is from ConConCon.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.560
ConConCon?

20:50.640 --> 20:53.360
Yeah, Connecticut Conspiracy Convention.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.600
I think you might be addicted
to conspiracy.

20:55.680 --> 20:58.240
Well, I used to be addicted to QAnon,

20:58.320 --> 21:00.640
and then I went to QAnon-anon.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.360
But I found out that even that's a hoax.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.440
Conspiracies are everywhere.

21:05.520 --> 21:09.160
Look what the Pentaverate
did to our currency, right?

21:09.240 --> 21:11.840
Normal five-dollar bill, right?

21:11.920 --> 21:12.760
Right.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.480
Wrongo!

21:15.200 --> 21:18.960
You fold it this way,
you fold it that way,

21:19.040 --> 21:23.800
you fold it this way,
and lookee here what we have.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.720
The five.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.400
Like the five members of the Pentaverate.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.760
It's right there!

21:30.840 --> 21:32.480
Think about it.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.360
Why would they put a five right there?

21:35.440 --> 21:40.280
To indicate that the bill has
a monetary value of five American dollars?

21:43.320 --> 21:45.720
It's like they're taunting us!

21:46.600 --> 21:49.600
-<i>This is Kilo Echo November.</i>

21:49.680 --> 21:51.200
<i>Do you read me?</i>

21:51.280 --> 21:54.440
Ken, how's it going?
Are we still on for a meeting tonight?

21:54.520 --> 21:59.640
We are so close to exposing
these Charlie Uniform November Tangos.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.240
-<i>Yeah.</i>

22:01.320 --> 22:03.680
You'll never believe what I just saw.

22:03.760 --> 22:06.080
<i> Did you catch them</i>
<i>sucking each other's blood?</i>

22:06.160 --> 22:08.520
<i>Did you grab any adrenochrome?</i>

22:08.600 --> 22:10.800
Well, no, actually. They're, uh…

22:10.880 --> 22:13.280
They do some pretty good things
though, eh?

22:13.880 --> 22:16.600
-<i> Oh my God, he's brainwashed.</i>

22:17.240 --> 22:20.360
Listen, I gotta make like a baby
and head out.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.560
<i>I'll see you by the entrance.</i>

22:35.200 --> 22:36.520
Over here, soldier.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.080
Holy jumpin'!

22:41.160 --> 22:43.120
What the hell happened here?

22:43.760 --> 22:46.400
The Maester
and his lackeys have been murdered.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.520
Murdered?

22:48.320 --> 22:49.160
Look.

22:49.240 --> 22:52.280
The Maester left a message
in his own blood.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.920
"Parce Clavem"?

22:54.520 --> 22:57.880
That's the spare Pentaverate key
in Dubrovnik.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.280
It must be a sign.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.880
I'm taking matters
into my own hands, Yeoman Doll.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.320
We're going to Dubrovnik to get that key.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.560
-But, sir, I was--
-That's an order!

23:08.920 --> 23:12.400
-But, sir, I have--
-It's time for you to shine, kid!

23:12.480 --> 23:14.560
-<i>Ken, are… are you there?</i>

23:14.640 --> 23:16.000
Ken, where are you?

23:16.080 --> 23:17.600
Hoo-ah!

23:20.480 --> 23:21.760
<i>Ken, what is going on?</i>

23:21.840 --> 23:26.360
I'm being sent to Dubrovnik.
I repeat, sent to Dubrovnik.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.520
What's Dubrovnik?

23:28.080 --> 23:30.920
Is that a euphemism
for being probed in your no-no hole?

23:31.800 --> 23:32.720
No. No!

23:32.800 --> 23:34.000
Yes! Yes!

23:34.080 --> 23:37.200
If that key
gets into the wrong hands, we're doomed.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.320
Now, go!

23:38.400 --> 23:40.360
Hey, quit poking me.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.320
It <i>is </i>being probed in your no-no hole.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.440
You're being probed in your no-no hole!

23:45.280 --> 23:48.560
<i>Musk departure for Dubrovnik,</i>
<i>T-minus one minute.</i>

23:48.640 --> 23:51.080
-Damn, it's the Sasquatch!

23:51.160 --> 23:52.640
Oh my God.

23:52.720 --> 23:56.000
<i>-It's even bigger and hairier up close.</i>

24:00.920 --> 24:02.440
-Ow!

24:06.880 --> 24:08.840
<i>Musk cleared for departure.</i>

24:10.160 --> 24:11.000
All clear here.

24:11.080 --> 24:15.840
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>
