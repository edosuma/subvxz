00:28.853 --> 00:30.937
<i>Grace Morgan,
get back in this house!</i>

00:40.531 --> 00:43.416
Grace!
Get back here!

00:43.500 --> 00:44.450
<i>Grace!</i>

00:46.203 --> 00:47.620
You sure
about this, Gracie?

00:47.705 --> 00:50.006
I've never been more sure
about anything in my life.

00:58.349 --> 01:01.100
You go now, you don't ever come back!
Never!

01:01.185 --> 01:02.969
Go, Ken.
Drive! Now!

02:24.601 --> 02:25.685
<i>House is
all buttoned up.</i>

02:26.937 --> 02:28.938
Is there anything else
I can do?

02:28.973 --> 02:31.024
No, thank you, Steve.

02:33.143 --> 02:34.560
Is that from
your dad's office?

02:35.896 --> 02:38.064
Yeah, it is.

02:38.148 --> 02:41.183
It's actually from
the Circle Cross.

02:41.235 --> 02:43.236
Kennedy, trust me.

02:43.320 --> 02:45.021
You don't want
to drag this out.

02:45.072 --> 02:46.823
Just sign the papers
and sell it.

02:48.208 --> 02:51.244
It's just my dad
was born on that ranch.

02:51.328 --> 02:53.496
Grew up there.

02:53.547 --> 02:57.199
Met my mother,
they fell in love.

02:57.251 --> 02:59.552
I know how hard
this is for you,

02:59.636 --> 03:01.671
but I'm here.

03:01.722 --> 03:03.973
I'll help you
through it.

03:04.008 --> 03:05.141
I promise.

03:09.430 --> 03:11.764
You are his
sole beneficiary.

03:11.849 --> 03:14.600
The Circle Cross
belongs to you now.

03:14.685 --> 03:16.185
However, he stipulates

03:16.236 --> 03:18.988
that if you should
choose to sell it,

03:19.023 --> 03:21.574
you have to be there,
in person, to do it.

03:21.658 --> 03:24.494
<i>So you're telling me
I actually have togothere</i>

03:24.528 --> 03:25.728
to sell the ranch?

03:25.779 --> 03:27.663
As a condition
of the will, yes.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.117
That doesn't make
any sense.

03:31.201 --> 03:33.202
I mean, when
I was growing up

03:33.253 --> 03:35.004
I used to beg him
to take me

03:35.039 --> 03:36.589
to see that place.

03:36.673 --> 03:39.509
He always resisted.

03:39.543 --> 03:41.210
<i>Nowhe says
I have to go?</i>

03:41.261 --> 03:44.130
There's a cousin of yours
there who's an accountant.

03:44.214 --> 03:46.933
Smith Blaine, he's been
keeping the books.

03:47.017 --> 03:48.684
You think he might
have some answers?

03:48.719 --> 03:50.603
Only one way
to find out.

03:53.690 --> 03:56.275
Looks like I'm going
to Valentine.

04:00.864 --> 04:02.198
<i># Wake up, darling</i>

04:02.232 --> 04:04.934
<i># It's just you and me</i>

04:04.985 --> 04:06.786
<i># Everything feels right</i>

04:06.870 --> 04:10.123
<i># Just like
it's meant to be #</i>

04:10.207 --> 04:11.774
<i># Let's live up
the morning #</i>

04:11.825 --> 04:14.127
<i># Spend the afternoon</i>

04:14.211 --> 04:15.828
<i># 'Cause we can't
take it with us #</i>

04:15.913 --> 04:19.132
<i># And tomorrow
comes too soon #</i>

04:19.216 --> 04:27.223
<i># In every single way</i>

04:27.225 --> 04:30.309
<i># Today is the perfect day</i>

04:30.394 --> 04:31.978
<i># For a perfect day</i>

04:36.100 --> 04:38.300
<i># I don't want it to end</i>

04:38.352 --> 04:40.570
<i># I don't want it to end</i>

04:40.604 --> 04:43.906
<i># I don't want it to end</i>

04:43.941 --> 04:48.828
<i># Unless we can do today
all over again #</i>

04:48.912 --> 04:54.450
<i># All over again</i>

05:34.074 --> 05:35.024
<i>You know,
it's been a long time</i>

05:35.075 --> 05:36.576
since I last
saw your folks,

05:36.660 --> 05:40.046
but I do remember,
boy, they were good people.

05:40.130 --> 05:42.248
It's just a shame
they were never able

05:42.332 --> 05:44.500
to make it back
to Valentine.

05:44.551 --> 05:45.918
I think so, too.

05:46.003 --> 05:48.421
But here we are now,
and if you don't mind,

05:48.505 --> 05:51.057
-I'd like to just cut to the chase.
-Please.

05:52.843 --> 05:56.145
Did Talbot mention
that this is not

05:56.180 --> 05:58.981
the first offer we've had
on the ranch over the years?

05:59.016 --> 06:01.017
<i>-No.
-As I understand it,</i>

06:01.068 --> 06:04.320
your father wouldn't
consider selling.

06:04.354 --> 06:07.023
I can understand why he wanted
to hang onto the old place.

06:07.074 --> 06:09.859
He probably had some
sentimental attachment.

06:09.910 --> 06:11.393
And you can take
my word for it,

06:11.445 --> 06:13.062
that is a good offer

06:13.113 --> 06:15.281
under the circumstances.

06:15.365 --> 06:17.333
What circumstances?

06:17.367 --> 06:19.669
Listen, running a ranch

06:19.703 --> 06:23.673
is a dicey proposition
in the best of times.

06:23.707 --> 06:27.343
<i>Onebad year can set you
back for a long time.</i>

06:27.377 --> 06:29.178
And, well, the Circle Cross

06:29.213 --> 06:33.599
has had more bad years
than good, here, recently.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.635
The ranch is losing money?

06:35.719 --> 06:38.104
I hate to be
the bearer of bad news.

06:40.057 --> 06:42.725
You know, I'm not seeing a
buyer's name on here anywhere.

06:42.776 --> 06:43.776
Well, at the present
they wish

06:43.860 --> 06:45.594
to remain anonymous.

06:45.646 --> 06:47.813
<i>But what Icantell you</i>

06:47.898 --> 06:49.398
<i>is they areverymotivated.</i>

06:51.068 --> 06:54.987
So, you can go ahead
and sign and date

06:55.072 --> 06:56.789
right next to the "X."

06:58.825 --> 07:00.776
You know, I did have
one question.

07:00.827 --> 07:02.444
<i>Sure.</i>

07:02.496 --> 07:04.213
Do you know why my father
put in his will

07:04.248 --> 07:06.882
that I had to come here
to sell the ranch?

07:06.917 --> 07:08.284
You know,
actually,

07:08.335 --> 07:11.387
I was kind of wondering
about that myself.

07:11.421 --> 07:14.674
You know, whenever my parents
talked about Valentine,

07:14.758 --> 07:16.759
they always
called it home.

07:18.262 --> 07:20.129
<i>Theirhome,</i>

07:20.180 --> 07:22.131
but it's not yours.

07:22.182 --> 07:24.066
But I've never
even seen it.

07:24.101 --> 07:25.851
It seems silly
to come all this way

07:25.936 --> 07:28.187
and not have a look.

08:12.199 --> 08:13.733
Hey, buddy.

08:13.817 --> 08:14.950
<i>Where'd you come from?</i>

08:14.985 --> 08:17.019
Okay.

08:18.572 --> 08:22.158
Can we just
be friends from afar?

08:22.209 --> 08:23.159
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

08:23.210 --> 08:26.195
<i>I'm just taking
a peek around.</i>

08:26.246 --> 08:27.696
Okay.
I'm not gonna bite.

08:27.748 --> 08:30.549
I just wanna get
just a little bit closer

08:30.634 --> 08:33.302
so I can see...

08:33.337 --> 08:34.970
Quiet, Wilson!

08:35.005 --> 08:37.590
Hey. Thanks.
Great dog.

08:37.674 --> 08:39.475
-Are you lost?
-What?

08:39.509 --> 08:41.092
Main road's
back that way.

08:41.178 --> 08:42.761
No, I was just

08:42.846 --> 08:44.063
admiring the house.

08:44.147 --> 08:46.182
So you figured you'd
drive on private property,

08:46.233 --> 08:47.767
invite yourself up
on the porch,

08:47.851 --> 08:48.934
<i>and have a good look
through the window?</i>

08:49.019 --> 08:50.269
No, that was not...

08:50.354 --> 08:52.071
I don't go into
the city much.

08:52.155 --> 08:54.156
Is this how it's done
these days?

08:54.191 --> 08:55.941
Well, I don't come out
to the country much,

08:56.026 --> 08:57.559
but I heard you people
were supposed to be friendly.

08:57.611 --> 08:58.778
You want friendly?

08:58.862 --> 09:00.279
Try knocking on the door
introducing yourself.

09:00.364 --> 09:01.530
Maybe you should
introduce yourself

09:01.581 --> 09:03.616
since you're the one
that's trespassing.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.034
Excuse me?

09:05.085 --> 09:07.036
This is the
Circle Cross Ranch?

09:07.087 --> 09:08.537
Well, that's what
the sign says.

09:08.588 --> 09:10.589
Well, my name
is Kennedy Blaine

09:10.674 --> 09:12.375
and I own this property.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.260
What are
you talking about?

09:14.344 --> 09:15.678
Here.

09:15.712 --> 09:18.180
See for yourself.

09:26.723 --> 09:29.925
-You're Smith Blaine's cousin?
-That's right.

09:29.976 --> 09:31.026
Second cousin,
technically.

09:31.061 --> 09:33.229
I think... Which is
not the point.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.697
Smith didn't say
anything to me

09:34.731 --> 09:36.282
about a new owner
showing up.

09:36.366 --> 09:37.400
Well, why should he?

09:37.451 --> 09:38.901
For all I know,
you're just some squatter.

09:38.952 --> 09:40.069
Now, hold on a minute.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.654
<i>Derek.</i>

09:41.738 --> 09:43.739
Didn't know
you had company.

09:43.790 --> 09:45.408
She was just leaving.

09:46.543 --> 09:47.493
I'm June Sterling.

09:47.577 --> 09:50.129
I'm Kennedy Blaine.
Nice to meet you.

09:50.213 --> 09:51.997
Your mom
was Grace Morgan.

09:52.082 --> 09:54.283
She ran off with Kenny
Blaine a long time ago.

09:54.334 --> 09:55.468
You knew my parents?

09:55.552 --> 09:56.919
Well enough to
recognize their daughter.

09:56.970 --> 09:59.839
I mean, you're the spitting
image of your mom.

09:59.923 --> 10:00.923
Welcome home, honey.

10:03.427 --> 10:05.928
You know, those families
were so dead-set against

10:05.979 --> 10:08.180
your folks getting married.

10:08.265 --> 10:10.149
Especially your grandfather,
Gabriel Morgan,

10:10.233 --> 10:11.150
<i>he couldn't stand
the thought</i>

10:11.234 --> 10:12.151
<i>of his only daughter</i>

10:12.235 --> 10:13.269
<i>marrying a Blaine.</i>

10:14.438 --> 10:15.905
He's still alive,
you know.

10:15.939 --> 10:17.239
No. No, I didn't.

10:17.274 --> 10:19.742
Mom, she's not here
for a family reunion.

10:19.776 --> 10:22.244
She claims to own
the Circle Cross now.

10:24.831 --> 10:27.166
Does that mean that both
of your parents have p...

10:27.250 --> 10:32.421
My mom died five years ago,
and Dad died just recently.

10:32.456 --> 10:34.006
They were still young,
I'm so sorry.

10:35.125 --> 10:36.459
<i>Thank you.</i>

10:36.510 --> 10:38.344
<i>Well, you did
the right thing coming here.</i>

10:38.428 --> 10:39.678
Why don't you
stay for dinner?

10:39.763 --> 10:42.164
No, I don't
want to impose

10:42.215 --> 10:44.800
and I really wasn't
planning on a long stay.

10:44.851 --> 10:45.851
Don't be silly.

10:45.936 --> 10:46.852
We have plenty of room.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.138
Stay with us.
Really, seriously.

10:50.273 --> 10:52.358
All right.

10:52.442 --> 10:54.059
Good, so you can
follow us to the house.

10:54.144 --> 10:56.178
So you
don't live here?

10:56.229 --> 10:58.063
No, this is
the main house.

10:58.148 --> 10:59.315
That's where
the Blaines lived.

10:59.366 --> 11:00.950
The, the foreman's house

11:00.984 --> 11:02.868
is quite a ways
over there, actually.

11:02.953 --> 11:05.571
Foreman?

11:05.655 --> 11:07.072
You didn't tell her?

11:07.157 --> 11:11.410
We were just getting to that.

11:11.495 --> 11:13.295
<i>This makes
so much sense now.</i>

11:13.330 --> 11:14.964
<i>I have a package for you.</i>

11:24.090 --> 11:25.174
<i>The funny thing is that</i>

11:25.225 --> 11:26.708
<i>John Morgan
and Alexander Blaine</i>

11:26.760 --> 11:28.710
<i>were best friends when
they came out west together</i>

11:28.762 --> 11:30.479
<i>in the 1870's.</i>

11:30.514 --> 11:32.765
<i>They were searching for gold
like everybody else.</i>

11:32.849 --> 11:34.183
<i>However,</i>

11:34.234 --> 11:35.568
the story goes that
it wasn't very long

11:35.652 --> 11:38.938
before they both fell in
love with the same woman.

11:39.022 --> 11:40.222
So what happened?

11:40.273 --> 11:42.891
Well, she chose Alexander

11:42.943 --> 11:44.994
and the feud started,
right then and there.

11:45.028 --> 11:46.862
It's been going ever since.

11:46.913 --> 11:48.747
Such a waste.

11:48.832 --> 11:51.750
So, Kennedy,
what do you do?

11:51.835 --> 11:53.919
I just finished law school.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.170
<i>So I need to take
the bar exam</i>

11:55.205 --> 11:56.672
next month
back in L.A.

11:56.706 --> 11:58.407
Well, I hope you're gonna
have time to see the ranch

11:58.458 --> 12:00.742
-before you go back.
-Yeah, I'd like that.

12:00.794 --> 12:01.877
Derek can show you around.

12:03.296 --> 12:04.380
I have stuff to do

12:04.431 --> 12:06.348
for the next couple
of days, Mom, I'm sorry.

12:09.436 --> 12:12.187
Listen, I'm sorry about
the whole "squatter" thing.

12:12.222 --> 12:14.756
<i>I think I'm just nervous.</i>

12:14.808 --> 12:16.609
This is all so sudden,
coming here.

12:18.361 --> 12:19.395
Why are you here?

12:20.447 --> 12:22.231
I'm here to close the sale.

12:25.869 --> 12:27.736
Of the ranch?

12:27.787 --> 12:30.956
Yes, but I didn't know
anyone lived here.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.993
<i>And... and now that I've seen
the property and the house,</i>

12:34.077 --> 12:36.962
<i>I hadnoidea this
all belonged to me.</i>

12:37.047 --> 12:38.547
You know, it takes more
than a piece of paper

12:38.582 --> 12:41.417
to belong to a place.

12:47.424 --> 12:48.807
I'm gonna check
on the horses, Mom.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.677
Nice meeting you.

12:51.761 --> 12:53.979
Yeah, you too.

12:56.816 --> 12:59.485
He's very protective.

12:59.569 --> 13:00.986
Loves this place
like it's his own.

13:01.071 --> 13:02.988
He learned everything
there is to know

13:03.073 --> 13:06.442
about taking care of it
from John, my husband.

13:06.493 --> 13:08.694
So when he passed away,
it was just natural

13:08.778 --> 13:10.979
Derek take over.

13:11.031 --> 13:12.031
Hasn't been easy,

13:12.115 --> 13:15.167
but we've always
taken those words to heart.

13:15.251 --> 13:17.169
<i>We've been so blessed
to live here.</i>

13:18.588 --> 13:21.090
Can't even imagine
a better place to call home.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.927
The pa... the package.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.469
Here.

13:36.356 --> 13:39.141
"To Kennedy Blaine,
care of the Circle Cross Ranch,

13:39.192 --> 13:40.309
from Gregory Talbot."

13:40.360 --> 13:41.894
He's our lawyer.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.665
This is my mother's writing.

14:06.169 --> 14:08.587
Dad must've had
this sent here.

14:10.340 --> 14:11.924
Like he sent me.

14:38.118 --> 14:39.835
Mike, I'm full.

14:55.301 --> 14:57.052
<i>"It's a classic story.</i>

14:57.103 --> 14:58.771
<i>Forbidden love.</i>

14:58.855 --> 15:00.889
<i>But for Kenny and I,
the only thing forbidden</i>

15:00.940 --> 15:03.025
<i>was letting others
try to control our fate..."</i>

15:03.059 --> 15:05.594
<i>"I'll admit, at first
it was a thrill,</i>

15:05.645 --> 15:07.362
<i>dangerous and fun,</i>

15:07.397 --> 15:08.947
<i>then it became a burden.</i>

15:09.032 --> 15:11.283
<i>Always on edge, always looking
over our shoulders..."</i>

15:11.367 --> 15:15.604
<i>"One day, Kenny said our happiness
should never be a struggle.</i>

15:15.655 --> 15:19.274
<i>He took me to his family's
ranch, the Circle Cross,</i>

15:19.325 --> 15:21.777
<i>and there we fell deeper
in love with each other th..."</i>

15:31.921 --> 15:32.888
Hey.

15:34.090 --> 15:36.809
Yeah, everything's
been good.

15:38.762 --> 15:41.263
No, I know.
But it's only a few days

15:41.314 --> 15:44.149
and I still have a month
before the exam.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.401
I'll study while I'm here.

15:46.436 --> 15:48.470
Yeah.
No, I know.

15:48.521 --> 15:50.522
Hey, listen.
I'm... I'm really tired,

15:50.607 --> 15:53.358
I think I'm gonna
turn in early.

15:53.443 --> 15:54.943
Is that okay?

15:56.496 --> 15:57.496
Okay, thanks.

15:58.948 --> 16:00.783
Goodnight, Steve.

16:39.531 --> 16:42.282
-Morning.
-Good morning.

16:42.367 --> 16:44.284
Water's hot,
would you like some tea?

16:44.369 --> 16:47.237
I actually need
to talk to Derek first.

16:47.288 --> 16:50.123
-Is he around?
-You know, he was just riding out.

16:50.208 --> 16:52.543
You might still
catch him in the stables.

16:52.594 --> 16:53.710
Thanks.

17:00.218 --> 17:01.918
Hey, there.

17:05.890 --> 17:07.457
Well, you just pop up
everywhere, don't you?

17:07.525 --> 17:09.358
<i>I could say
the same thing about you.</i>

17:17.734 --> 17:19.536
Are you looking for me?

17:19.570 --> 17:21.288
Yeah. I...

17:21.372 --> 17:23.040
I wanted to talk to you
about the ranch.

17:23.074 --> 17:24.875
What about it?

17:24.909 --> 17:26.960
When was the last time
Smith Blaine was here?

17:27.045 --> 17:28.945
The only time I see him

17:28.997 --> 17:30.714
is when he gets
another offer.

17:33.251 --> 17:35.419
You know, lucky for you
your dad had the sense

17:35.470 --> 17:38.722
not to be tempted by dollar
signs over the years.

17:38.756 --> 17:41.425
So you don't think
I should sell?

17:41.476 --> 17:42.559
A person would
have to be a fool

17:42.594 --> 17:44.311
to sell a place
like this.

17:44.395 --> 17:45.929
Even with all the money
it's losing?

17:49.484 --> 17:51.018
What are you talking
about, losing money?

17:51.102 --> 17:53.637
Smith painted a different
picture of this place.

17:53.688 --> 17:55.772
He told me how rough
things have been lately.

17:55.823 --> 17:57.608
Look, the Circle Cross
hasn't lost a dime

17:57.659 --> 17:59.576
since I took over
as foreman.

17:59.611 --> 18:02.412
The last four years
have been our best ever.

18:02.447 --> 18:05.532
Your dad put the profits back into
the ranch, hired more hands...

18:05.617 --> 18:07.200
Derek, I'm sure
you've done your best.

18:07.285 --> 18:09.419
But Smith is our accountant.

18:09.454 --> 18:11.255
He keeps very careful books.

18:12.457 --> 18:13.957
Well, he's not
the only one.

18:16.010 --> 18:17.377
My father kept
written ledgers

18:17.462 --> 18:20.163
while he ran the place.

18:20.214 --> 18:21.265
I started
putting everything

18:21.299 --> 18:23.333
on a computer
when I took over.

18:23.384 --> 18:27.337
Nothing fancy, but it
saves a lot of time.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.726
This is quite the set-up.

18:32.810 --> 18:35.946
Yeah, we got indoor plumbing,
now, and everything.

18:35.980 --> 18:37.347
Hey, no, I wasn't...

18:37.398 --> 18:38.532
<i>Look...</i>

18:38.616 --> 18:40.067
That's got all
the ranch records

18:40.151 --> 18:41.902
for the past four years.

18:41.986 --> 18:44.321
You can see for yourself
how I do things.

18:46.741 --> 18:47.708
Where you going?

18:48.993 --> 18:50.494
I got a ranch to run.

19:09.347 --> 19:11.732
It's a lot to take in
all at once.

19:11.816 --> 19:13.150
I'll say.

19:15.019 --> 19:17.270
Have you been inside
the family house yet?

19:17.355 --> 19:18.772
No, not yet.

19:18.856 --> 19:20.240
You gotta see that.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.492
I'm gonna go
get the keys.

19:22.527 --> 19:24.244
So Derek and I come over
here about once a week,

19:24.329 --> 19:26.530
make sure everything's
okay, you know.

19:26.581 --> 19:29.232
No leaks, no critters.

19:29.283 --> 19:31.501
Well, you've done
a great job.

19:31.536 --> 19:34.004
Place has been kept
so beautiful.

19:35.256 --> 19:36.790
You know, this room
pretty well tells

19:36.874 --> 19:38.792
<i>the Blaine family history.</i>

19:38.876 --> 19:40.744
My father's family.

19:40.795 --> 19:42.262
Thought you'd like this.

19:54.559 --> 19:56.360
My mom and dad always
talked about how much

19:56.394 --> 19:58.729
they loved growing up here.

20:01.816 --> 20:04.985
But after Mom died, Dad never
mentioned Circle Cross again.

20:05.069 --> 20:06.653
Yeah, well, take it
from an old woman who knows

20:06.738 --> 20:09.156
there's no greater force
in this universe

20:09.240 --> 20:12.542
than true love.

20:12.577 --> 20:15.295
<i>You're awisewoman,
not old.</i>

20:16.748 --> 20:18.465
And I'm old enough
to know the difference.

20:18.549 --> 20:20.217
Okay.

20:20.251 --> 20:22.669
I'm gonna let you look around,
I'll see you later.

20:22.754 --> 20:23.720
Okay.

21:04.178 --> 21:05.512
<i>I don't understand.</i>

21:05.596 --> 21:07.764
The ranch foreman
kept his own records?

21:07.799 --> 21:09.833
He has everything
down to the penny.

21:09.884 --> 21:13.437
And according to him,
the ranch is making money.

21:13.471 --> 21:15.188
<i>Some years
better than others,</i>

21:15.273 --> 21:17.891
and Smith says it's been
losing money the whole time.

21:17.975 --> 21:19.893
<i>What do you
know about this guy?</i>

21:19.977 --> 21:22.612
He's a cowboy.

21:22.647 --> 21:24.614
Meaning... what exactly?

21:26.751 --> 21:28.902
It's like in the movies,
except real.

21:28.986 --> 21:34.491
I mean, he's strong
and sure, stubborn.

21:34.542 --> 21:37.577
Clearly a lot smarter
than he lets on, and...

21:39.831 --> 21:42.415
and he seems
like a good man.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.701
I'm not accusing
anybody of anything,

21:44.752 --> 21:46.636
but your father
received reports

21:46.671 --> 21:49.222
<i>from Smith quarterly
for years.</i>

21:49.307 --> 21:51.207
Well, did he read them?

21:51.259 --> 21:54.427
The ranch is the least
of your father's investments.

21:54.512 --> 21:56.146
Did he ever
show them to you?

21:56.180 --> 21:58.181
No, I don't even know
where they are.

21:59.767 --> 22:02.051
Look, something is just
not adding up here

22:02.103 --> 22:04.688
and I gotta get
to the bottom of it.

22:07.191 --> 22:10.059
<i>And I'll track down
Smith's records.</i>

22:10.111 --> 22:11.661
It might take a week,
but I'll go through everything

22:11.696 --> 22:13.330
and get back to you.

22:13.364 --> 22:14.998
Thank you.

22:15.032 --> 22:18.084
How do you
like the place?

22:19.420 --> 22:20.754
It's growing on me.

23:02.997 --> 23:04.047
Yes?

23:05.132 --> 23:09.302
Hi. I'm here
to see Gabriel Morgan.

23:09.387 --> 23:10.720
My name is Kennedy Blaine.

23:17.128 --> 23:19.129
Is Mr. Morgan
expecting you?

23:21.582 --> 23:22.916
I'm his granddaughter.

23:48.859 --> 23:50.911
Have a seat.

23:50.995 --> 23:53.246
This isn't a social call,
I prefer to stand.

23:54.532 --> 23:57.250
Suit yourself.
State your purpose.

23:59.203 --> 24:01.121
Are you behind the offer
to buy Circle Cross?

24:02.873 --> 24:06.259
I wouldn't take that property
if you gave it to me.

24:06.344 --> 24:08.295
I don't want anything
owned by a Blaine.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.414
Yeah, well, I'm
a prime example of that.

24:11.465 --> 24:13.767
Your parents
should've told you.

24:13.851 --> 24:14.801
You're not wanted here.

24:14.885 --> 24:17.920
They told me,
and I stayed away

24:17.972 --> 24:19.272
until now.

24:19.357 --> 24:21.825
<i>But I'm not here for
travel advice, Mr. Morgan.</i>

24:21.892 --> 24:25.061
I just want one more
thing before I go.

24:27.281 --> 24:28.949
An explanation.

24:29.033 --> 24:30.233
For what?

24:31.485 --> 24:33.269
How you treated my mother.

24:33.321 --> 24:36.072
Your daughter. Why?

24:36.123 --> 24:40.744
Our families have had
a long history together.

24:40.795 --> 24:42.612
You can't just
roll into town

24:42.663 --> 24:45.332
and expect to understand
every little, itsy-bitsy

24:45.416 --> 24:47.500
thing between people.

24:48.886 --> 24:50.637
They were in love.
They were happy.

24:50.721 --> 24:53.306
<i>What's so wrong with that?</i>

24:53.391 --> 24:55.458
What's wrong with you?

24:55.509 --> 24:58.511
No, no, no.
I'm... I'm only laughing

24:58.596 --> 25:01.297
because your mother
stood right there

25:01.349 --> 25:03.233
25 years ago,

25:03.267 --> 25:06.903
and asked
those same questions.

25:06.937 --> 25:09.022
I don't explain,

25:09.106 --> 25:12.826
I don't justify
my actions to anybody.

25:12.910 --> 25:15.528
Now, unless you
have other business...

25:15.613 --> 25:19.499
She missed you.
We all did.

25:21.702 --> 25:23.753
Well...

25:23.788 --> 25:28.324
it was as much her choice
to do what she did

25:28.376 --> 25:30.543
as it was mine
to let her go.

25:32.930 --> 25:35.331
I think I got all
the information I need.

25:35.383 --> 25:37.801
Self-confidence...

25:37.852 --> 25:40.270
and determination.

25:40.304 --> 25:42.055
You know where
that came from?

25:44.442 --> 25:46.943
You may've been
born a Blaine,

25:46.977 --> 25:51.013
<i>but you're a Morgan,
through and through.</i>

25:51.065 --> 25:53.650
I like that.

25:53.701 --> 25:55.318
Thanks for your time.

26:03.542 --> 26:05.543
<i>I'm doing everything I can.</i>

26:05.594 --> 26:08.379
No, of course
she's gonna sell.

26:08.430 --> 26:11.048
She's not a rancher,
she's a city girl.

26:11.099 --> 26:12.466
We just need to give her
a little time

26:12.551 --> 26:14.802
to get over the whole
dewy-eyed thing

26:14.886 --> 26:16.721
with the ranch
and her parents, and the...

26:18.857 --> 26:20.274
No, listen to me.

26:20.359 --> 26:22.276
I've worked too hard
to make this happen.

26:22.361 --> 26:25.229
One way or another,
this deal's going through.

26:36.291 --> 26:37.875
<i>Sorry to bother you,
Boss, but I figured</i>

26:37.909 --> 26:39.610
<i>you'd wanna see this.</i>

26:39.661 --> 26:40.961
Check it out.

26:48.420 --> 26:50.638
<i>Looks like somebody
made themselves right at home.</i>

26:52.007 --> 26:54.642
Yeah, we checked the area,
but we didn't see anybody.

26:57.679 --> 27:00.314
They've been here
for a couple of days.

27:00.399 --> 27:01.816
<i>Could be a drifter.</i>

27:01.900 --> 27:04.268
<i>Maybe already moved on?</i>

27:05.404 --> 27:06.520
I'll clean this up.

27:06.605 --> 27:09.306
That way, if he comes back
he'll know we're onto him.

27:09.357 --> 27:11.025
Sure.

27:11.109 --> 27:13.811
Tell the others to keep
an eye out, okay?

27:13.862 --> 27:15.112
Sure thing, boss.

27:28.126 --> 27:30.511
Seriously?

27:30.595 --> 27:31.929
All right.

27:33.965 --> 27:35.716
Chewy bone.

27:35.801 --> 27:37.435
All right, truce?

27:40.856 --> 27:42.640
You know there's more
where that came from.

27:45.977 --> 27:47.061
Hello?

27:47.145 --> 27:48.279
Back here.

27:53.068 --> 27:54.017
Hey.

27:54.069 --> 27:55.069
Hey.

27:56.371 --> 27:57.788
So, what's all this?

27:57.823 --> 27:59.490
Well, I figured
since I'm a Blaine,

27:59.541 --> 28:02.042
I should be staying
in the Blaine house.

28:03.495 --> 28:05.028
<i>You wanted to know
why I'm here</i>

28:05.080 --> 28:06.914
<i>and today, it hit me.</i>

28:06.998 --> 28:09.383
I want to know more
about my family.

28:09.468 --> 28:10.835
And what better way,

28:10.886 --> 28:13.254
than to stay
in my father's old house?

28:15.423 --> 28:17.391
It's a big house
for one person.

28:17.476 --> 28:18.876
I'll be fine.

28:18.927 --> 28:20.644
Besides, it takes more
than a piece of paper

28:20.679 --> 28:22.263
to belong
to a place, right?

28:25.851 --> 28:28.102
Okay, fair enough.

28:30.188 --> 28:35.242
I, I saw
my grandfather today.

28:35.327 --> 28:36.527
You did?

28:37.696 --> 28:38.696
How'd that go?

28:40.081 --> 28:42.616
I expected him
to answer my questions.

28:42.701 --> 28:44.535
Tell me all the things
he's been holding in

28:44.586 --> 28:46.453
for so many years and...

28:47.923 --> 28:49.673
he laughed at me.

28:52.627 --> 28:53.677
Whatever he had to say,

28:53.712 --> 28:56.463
he said it to your folks
a long time ago.

28:56.548 --> 28:58.215
That old man
is so stubborn,

28:58.266 --> 28:59.767
he can argue
with a wall.

28:59.851 --> 29:01.886
And win.

29:03.522 --> 29:05.756
Hey.

29:05.807 --> 29:07.224
Don't let it get to you.

29:10.061 --> 29:12.947
Well, if he's waiting for me
to run away like my parents,

29:13.031 --> 29:14.899
he'll be waiting
for a long time.

29:20.071 --> 29:22.489
<i>Hey, Derek, listen.
I went over your records</i>

29:22.574 --> 29:23.991
<i>-for the ranch?
-Yeah?</i>

29:24.075 --> 29:25.275
They look fine to me.

29:25.327 --> 29:26.577
Well, good.

29:26.628 --> 29:28.412
What I don't understand
is why Smith would tell me

29:28.463 --> 29:30.464
we've been losing
money all along.

29:30.549 --> 29:31.749
Well, maybe
you should ask him.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.450
I will,
just after my lawyer

29:33.501 --> 29:34.969
has a chance to look
at your records.

29:35.053 --> 29:37.171
You just said
they were fine, right?

29:37.255 --> 29:39.790
Mr. Talbot has access
to all the reports

29:39.841 --> 29:41.091
that Smith had been
sending my dad.

29:41.142 --> 29:43.010
He just needs
to compare them.

29:43.094 --> 29:45.346
To make sure who's
telling the truth.

29:45.430 --> 29:47.264
No, Derek,
you don't understand.

29:47.315 --> 29:49.900
My father was
a solid businessman,

29:49.935 --> 29:52.069
but after my mother died,
he wasn't himself.

29:52.103 --> 29:54.104
He was heartbroken.

29:54.155 --> 29:55.823
I mean, I doubt he ever
looked at those reports.

29:55.907 --> 29:57.825
Smith could've been
telling him anything.

29:58.910 --> 29:59.827
Look, do me a favor.

29:59.911 --> 30:01.144
Once you get the
comparison back,

30:01.196 --> 30:03.480
talk to me first,
not Smith.

30:03.531 --> 30:05.315
Why?

30:05.367 --> 30:07.034
He thinks he's
the big dog around here.

30:07.118 --> 30:08.335
He doesn't like
to be crossed.

30:08.420 --> 30:10.621
If you have to confront him,
I would like to go with you.

30:10.672 --> 30:11.789
Let him sit across from me

30:11.840 --> 30:13.457
saying that the ranch
is losing money.

30:16.795 --> 30:19.847
Okay, will do. Thanks.

30:19.931 --> 30:21.715
No problem.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.601
Wilson, come on, boy.
Let's go home.

30:24.886 --> 30:26.270
Let's go, boy.

30:28.974 --> 30:30.140
Hey, what's wrong with you?

30:31.943 --> 30:35.562
He usually don't warm up
to anybody this fast.

30:35.647 --> 30:37.481
Well, I'm not so bad.

30:37.532 --> 30:41.235
Once you get to know me.

30:41.319 --> 30:42.369
Wilson, come on, boy.

30:42.454 --> 30:44.355
Let's go home.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.361
What's wrong with you, buddy?
You wanna go home?

30:51.413 --> 30:53.998
You want to go home?

31:10.015 --> 31:12.066
<i>I'm sorry,
am I missing something?</i>

31:12.150 --> 31:14.068
<i>I thought that the whole
point of going there,</i>

31:14.152 --> 31:16.219
<i>was to sell the ranch.</i>

31:16.271 --> 31:18.155
It was. I mean,
that's what I thought.

31:18.189 --> 31:21.725
But none of this
is what I expected.

31:21.776 --> 31:23.994
<i>Well, I'm sure
it's a wonderful place,</i>

31:24.029 --> 31:25.112
<i>with lots of nice people,</i>

31:25.196 --> 31:27.064
<i>but, Kennedy,
your life is here.</i>

31:27.115 --> 31:29.166
<i>You have
a home, friends.</i>

31:29.200 --> 31:30.784
<i>You're starting a new career
which, by the way,</i>

31:30.869 --> 31:32.619
<i>you're falling way behind
studying for the bar.</i>

31:32.704 --> 31:34.421
Yeah, yeah.
I was thinking about that.

31:34.506 --> 31:37.374
What if I took
the bar exam here?

31:37.425 --> 31:38.709
<i>You're not serious.</i>

31:38.760 --> 31:42.680
There is still a lot of work
to do with the ranch.

31:42.714 --> 31:44.465
<i>Well, it... you want
to live there?</i>

31:45.550 --> 31:47.634
I think I need
to find out what I want.

31:49.721 --> 31:51.939
<i>Kennedy...</i>

31:52.023 --> 31:54.108
<i>I miss you.</i>

31:54.192 --> 31:56.093
<i>I know we've never talked
about it in so many words,</i>

31:56.144 --> 31:59.897
<i>but I always thought
that you and I...</i>

31:59.948 --> 32:01.982
<i>that we belong together.</i>

32:02.067 --> 32:03.117
<i>Here.</i>

32:04.786 --> 32:06.653
<i>We belotogether?</i>

32:07.906 --> 32:09.439
Steve, where is this
coming from?

32:09.491 --> 32:11.274
<i>I...</i>

32:12.711 --> 32:13.844
<i>I just thought that...</i>

32:15.380 --> 32:17.447
L... Listen, it's getting late.

32:17.499 --> 32:20.501
<i>Can we talk about this
some other time?</i>

32:20.585 --> 32:22.586
<i>Sure.</i>

32:22.637 --> 32:23.921
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:25.090 --> 32:27.174
<i>Goodnight.</i>

32:27.258 --> 32:28.559
Goodnight.

33:14.716 --> 33:15.933
<i>Morning.</i>

33:16.017 --> 33:17.184
Hi.

33:17.218 --> 33:18.936
Didn't mean to scare you.

33:19.020 --> 33:21.421
No, I just... I didn't
hear you drive up.

33:21.473 --> 33:25.809
Well, I'm sorry, but is this
the Circle Cross Ranch?

33:25.894 --> 33:26.810
Yeah, that's right.

33:26.895 --> 33:28.028
A fellow in town
says you might

33:28.063 --> 33:29.530
be doing some hiring.

33:29.564 --> 33:30.731
I'm sorry,
you're gonna have to talk

33:30.782 --> 33:32.816
to the ranch foreman
about that.

33:32.901 --> 33:34.151
Derek Sterling.

33:34.235 --> 33:35.286
Derek Sterling.

33:35.370 --> 33:37.321
That's right. Yeah,
I do know the name.

33:39.074 --> 33:41.992
He lives just over there.

33:42.077 --> 33:43.377
Over there?

33:46.381 --> 33:47.581
He's a friend of yours?

33:49.134 --> 33:50.250
I own the ranch.

33:51.586 --> 33:53.754
Nice place.

33:53.805 --> 33:56.590
Kinda big, though, for you
to have all to yourself.

33:56.641 --> 33:58.258
Way out here
in the middle of nowhere.

33:59.794 --> 34:01.795
You know, why don't I call him
and tell him you're here.

34:01.846 --> 34:03.514
-I'm sure he'll be...
-No, that's okay.

34:03.598 --> 34:04.848
I could find him.

34:04.933 --> 34:05.966
Thank you,
you have a nice day.

34:09.938 --> 34:11.338
<i>Did you get his name?</i>

34:11.389 --> 34:13.556
<i>No, he just said
he was looking for work.</i>

34:13.641 --> 34:14.975
<i>I mean, anyone
from around here</i>

34:15.025 --> 34:16.275
knows we only hire
extra hands

34:16.311 --> 34:18.112
in the fall for round-up.

34:18.146 --> 34:19.612
Well, he didn't exactly
look like he knew

34:19.647 --> 34:21.065
one end of a horse
from the other.

34:21.149 --> 34:22.949
What do you mean?

34:22.984 --> 34:25.402
I don't know.
I just...

34:25.487 --> 34:29.123
I grew up in the city, and I
got the feeling so did he.

34:29.157 --> 34:30.657
He said he knew your name.

34:32.911 --> 34:33.994
What'd he look like?

34:34.045 --> 34:37.047
Stocky. Dark hair.

34:37.132 --> 34:39.299
Looked like he'd
slept in his clothes.

34:40.335 --> 34:42.168
And he had a...
A scar on his cheek.

34:44.222 --> 34:45.889
Do you know him?

34:45.974 --> 34:47.541
Probably he just

34:47.592 --> 34:49.560
heard my name
in town, you know?

34:49.643 --> 34:51.728
I'll take a look around,
just in case.

34:51.813 --> 34:53.013
All right, thanks.

34:53.063 --> 34:55.649
Hey...

34:55.683 --> 34:58.268
I was supposed to give Mom
a ride into Valentine.

34:58.353 --> 34:59.737
Would you mind?

34:59.821 --> 35:02.272
Not at all. I need
to pick up something

35:02.357 --> 35:04.891
a little more appropriate
to wear around here anyway.

35:04.943 --> 35:06.243
I appreciate it.

35:29.684 --> 35:31.301
Hey, listen.
I'm getting called back

35:31.386 --> 35:33.604
into a meeting. Can I
get back to you later?

35:33.688 --> 35:34.855
Great, thanks.

35:41.946 --> 35:43.397
What's the occasion?

35:43.448 --> 35:45.432
Well,
the Dandelion Festival.

35:45.483 --> 35:47.267
Every year, the church
raises money by selling

35:47.318 --> 35:49.536
foods, and arts and crafts,
and things, too.

35:49.571 --> 35:50.954
And we bring kids
out from the city

35:51.039 --> 35:52.539
to spend the weekend here,

35:52.574 --> 35:54.941
and they go camping,
and fishing, and...

35:54.993 --> 35:56.493
you know, getting
some fresh air.

35:56.578 --> 35:59.296
-That sounds wonderful.
-It's fun.

35:59.380 --> 36:00.998
And Pastor Morgan,
he sets up a booth

36:01.082 --> 36:04.117
every year so he wants me
to sell my, what he calls,

36:04.169 --> 36:06.503
"World famous
dandelion pies."

36:06.588 --> 36:07.787
Another Morgan.

36:07.839 --> 36:08.839
Apart from my grandfather,

36:08.923 --> 36:11.225
I haven't met anyone
on the Morgan side yet.

36:11.259 --> 36:12.726
That's easy to fix.
Come to church with us

36:12.760 --> 36:14.812
on Sunday and
I'll introduce you.

36:14.896 --> 36:17.314
I'd like that.

36:17.398 --> 36:19.817
So do you have a lot
of family here in Valentine?

36:19.901 --> 36:21.902
No, it's just
Derek and Me.

36:21.936 --> 36:26.406
Still, it must've been nice
for him growing up here.

36:26.441 --> 36:28.659
Well, Derek didn't
grow up here.

36:28.743 --> 36:29.860
John and I did.

36:29.944 --> 36:32.196
Yeah, see, back then
it wasn't easy

36:32.280 --> 36:34.248
to get a good-paying job
around here.

36:34.282 --> 36:35.616
So we moved to Chicago.

36:35.667 --> 36:37.317
John worked in a factory.

36:37.368 --> 36:40.838
We were young and we
wanted this big family,

36:40.922 --> 36:42.822
but it didn't happen.

36:42.874 --> 36:47.211
And, so... I was actually
volunteering at a city mission

36:47.295 --> 36:49.630
and Derek came up
for adoption.

36:49.681 --> 36:51.882
That's so nice.

36:51.966 --> 36:56.386
Our prayers
were definitely answered.

36:56.471 --> 36:58.388
So how long did you
live in Chicago?

36:58.473 --> 37:00.691
We didn't move
back to Valentine

37:00.775 --> 37:03.143
until Derek
was almost 16.

37:03.194 --> 37:05.362
Never would've guessed.

37:05.446 --> 37:07.698
Well, it wasn't easy

37:07.782 --> 37:10.350
for him growing up
in the city.

37:10.401 --> 37:11.401
What do you mean?

37:14.239 --> 37:17.875
<i>You know, this isn't
reallymystory to tell.</i>

37:17.959 --> 37:19.293
And we still have
a lot of shopping to do.

37:19.327 --> 37:22.162
<i>So, vamanos.</i>

37:22.213 --> 37:23.630
Right.

38:05.373 --> 38:07.040
We just missed him, boy.

38:12.213 --> 38:13.463
<i>Kennedy!</i>

38:13.548 --> 38:16.099
-Well, there you are.
-Hi.

38:16.184 --> 38:17.917
I tried to call you,

38:17.969 --> 38:20.053
but I kept getting
your answering machine.

38:20.104 --> 38:22.306
I was afraid you were
on your way back home.

38:22.390 --> 38:24.641
No, I'm staying
at the ranch.

38:24.726 --> 38:26.693
Reception's not
always the best.

38:26.728 --> 38:29.947
I was curious if you
thought about that offer.

38:30.031 --> 38:31.931
Haven't stopped
thinking about it.

38:31.983 --> 38:35.285
The other party is very
eager to close that deal.

38:35.370 --> 38:38.238
I'm sure, place is
a steal at that price.

38:39.824 --> 38:40.824
What are you saying?

38:40.908 --> 38:43.043
I think you know
what I'm saying.

38:43.077 --> 38:45.545
Mr. Talbot and I just have
to do our due diligence.

38:45.580 --> 38:46.713
Shouldn't take long.

38:48.583 --> 38:49.633
Well, then.

38:49.717 --> 38:51.134
You have a good day, June.

38:51.219 --> 38:52.753
-Say hi to Derek for me, will you?
-I will.

38:54.422 --> 38:56.056
Enjoy your stay.

38:56.090 --> 38:58.008
Will do.

39:13.354 --> 39:17.191
-Your friends miss you.
-Steve.

39:17.275 --> 39:19.860
I think he wishes
he was more than a friend.

39:19.944 --> 39:22.279
And he's not?

39:22.313 --> 39:25.065
He's a sweet guy,
met in law school.

39:25.149 --> 39:26.483
Became study partners.

39:26.534 --> 39:28.402
Spent a lot of late
nights together...

39:28.486 --> 39:30.370
And he fell in love.

39:30.455 --> 39:33.207
<i>We arenota couple.</i>

39:33.291 --> 39:34.541
He really cares about me,

39:34.626 --> 39:37.711
but if there
was anything there,

39:37.795 --> 39:40.297
I should miss him more...

39:40.331 --> 39:41.798
and I don't.

39:41.833 --> 39:45.368
Do you ride?

39:45.420 --> 39:47.037
<i>When other kids
were practicing the piano,</i>

39:47.105 --> 39:50.040
I was taking riding lessons.

39:50.091 --> 39:54.845
My parents used to always
hang around and watch.

39:54.896 --> 39:56.980
Think it must've reminded
them of this place.

40:00.652 --> 40:02.152
Hey, do you think...

40:02.186 --> 40:03.687
do you think
it'd be all right?

40:05.106 --> 40:06.690
It's your horse.

40:08.860 --> 40:10.410
I'll go get changed.

41:07.085 --> 41:08.118
What're you doing?

41:08.169 --> 41:09.336
How am I supposed
to know it was you

41:09.420 --> 41:10.387
coming out of nowhere?

41:14.092 --> 41:16.643
What? What are you looking
at me like that for?

41:16.728 --> 41:17.928
You can ride?

41:19.180 --> 41:21.315
Yeah. I mean,
a little, you know.

41:21.399 --> 41:24.067
No, I didn't know.
I know now.

41:25.320 --> 41:29.239
Since you can ride,
let me show you the place.

42:30.668 --> 42:33.587
-This is beautiful.
-Yeah.

42:35.840 --> 42:37.340
It is beautiful.

42:40.344 --> 42:42.979
Do you see that
tree line over there?

42:43.014 --> 42:46.066
Where? ...
Right there.

42:46.150 --> 42:48.318
You see? There's a valley

42:48.352 --> 42:51.238
that runs between
those hills there.

42:51.322 --> 42:53.774
Can you believe that wagon trains
used to bring settlers through here

42:53.858 --> 42:55.525
on their way west?

42:55.576 --> 42:56.777
-Really?
-Yeah.

42:56.861 --> 42:57.944
If you look close
on the trail,

42:58.029 --> 42:59.579
you can still see
where the wheels

42:59.664 --> 43:00.914
were torn in the ground.

43:03.084 --> 43:06.119
Your mother said there
was a family graveyard?

43:06.204 --> 43:08.371
Yeah. Not just
family, either.

43:08.423 --> 43:11.842
There's folks buried there, this is
as far as they got on the trail.

43:15.046 --> 43:17.848
It's a long ride out.
I'll take you next time.

43:21.385 --> 43:25.305
You know, my parents
always talked about

43:25.389 --> 43:28.258
how special this place was.

43:28.309 --> 43:30.861
I'm really glad that
I'm seeing it for myself.

43:34.615 --> 43:36.566
And what do you think
about this place?

43:37.735 --> 43:39.119
I think they were right.

43:41.789 --> 43:45.242
Thank you for showing me.

43:46.494 --> 43:47.744
My pleasure.

43:52.467 --> 43:54.501
We should...
We should start back.

43:54.585 --> 43:56.052
It'll be dark soon.

44:13.604 --> 44:14.771
I was thinking...

44:14.822 --> 44:16.139
I really think you should
stay here tonight

44:16.190 --> 44:17.357
with Mom and me.

44:17.441 --> 44:18.859
Just in case
that fellow comes back.

44:18.943 --> 44:20.443
Listen, it took me
my whole life to get here,

44:20.495 --> 44:22.662
I'm not gonna let
anybody scare me off now.

44:22.747 --> 44:24.698
Hey, look.

44:24.782 --> 44:25.866
Cuddy and Brian,
they came across

44:25.950 --> 44:27.501
some empty bottles and trash

44:27.585 --> 44:28.818
in one of the old barns.

44:28.870 --> 44:30.253
If there's someone out there,
I think we just...

44:30.288 --> 44:34.124
Hey, if I hear anything,
I'll call you, I promise.

44:36.127 --> 44:38.161
-All right.
-Okay.

44:38.212 --> 44:40.514
So, goodnight, then.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.434
Hey, Wilson. Stay.

44:44.468 --> 44:46.853
You coming with me?

44:46.938 --> 44:48.438
<i>Well, you're
such good buddies.</i>

44:48.472 --> 44:50.307
Now you can be roomies.

44:50.358 --> 44:51.725
He better not snore.

44:51.809 --> 44:53.527
He does.

44:53.611 --> 44:54.811
Heavily.

45:34.518 --> 45:36.152
You been out here
all night?

45:48.282 --> 45:50.500
Thank you.

45:52.370 --> 45:54.087
You don't need
to do this.

45:58.843 --> 46:01.011
I better get changed,
I don't wanna be late.

46:01.045 --> 46:03.546
-Late?
-For church.

46:05.132 --> 46:07.217
Are you gonna make it
to the festival?

46:07.268 --> 46:08.852
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

46:10.271 --> 46:12.055
We'll pick you up
on our way into town.

46:13.858 --> 46:14.891
Great.

46:16.227 --> 46:17.894
Thanks for the coffee.

47:19.373 --> 47:20.590
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

47:26.347 --> 47:27.464
<i>Silly old man.</i>

47:28.549 --> 47:29.716
Living up in his castle

47:29.800 --> 47:32.552
all hanging onto
that bitterness.

47:32.636 --> 47:34.888
He doesn't even know me.

47:36.807 --> 47:39.776
You know what?
We've got pies to sell.

47:39.810 --> 47:41.077
Yes, we do.

47:46.167 --> 47:48.201
<i>Well, folks, we've
got lots of exciting events</i>

47:48.252 --> 47:50.503
<i>going on at this year's
Dandelion Festival.</i>

47:50.554 --> 47:52.555
<i>A new cooking
demonstration every hour,</i>

47:52.640 --> 47:54.641
<i>with all sorts
of dandelion recipes.</i>

47:54.675 --> 47:56.676
<i>And this year's art show
and silent auction</i>

47:56.727 --> 47:58.895
<i>promises to be our best.</i>

47:58.979 --> 48:00.814
<i>But now it's time to get
all the kids together</i>

48:00.848 --> 48:02.682
<i>for the Dandelion
Scavenger Hunt.</i>

48:09.774 --> 48:12.609
<i>And make sure to stop by the
Valentine Church bake sale</i>

48:12.693 --> 48:15.745
<i>and to take home some
World Famous Dandelion Pie.</i>

48:15.830 --> 48:17.113
<i>Thank you.
Enjoy your pie.</i>

48:17.198 --> 48:18.948
Hey, guys, we're actually
running out of plates.

48:19.033 --> 48:19.949
-I'll get it.
-You sure?

48:20.034 --> 48:21.034
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

48:22.787 --> 48:24.370
<i>Support your
annual camping trip</i>

48:24.422 --> 48:25.371
<i>for inner city kids.</i>

48:29.343 --> 48:30.543
Excuse me.

48:30.594 --> 48:32.045
You must be
the long-lost cousin

48:32.096 --> 48:33.797
I've been hearing about.

48:33.881 --> 48:35.715
Tom Morgan,
welcome to Valentine.

48:35.766 --> 48:37.016
Kennedy Blaine. Thank you.

48:37.051 --> 48:38.852
I could tell you're family

48:38.886 --> 48:40.753
a mile off.

48:40.805 --> 48:42.021
You have your mother's smile.

48:42.056 --> 48:43.022
Really?

48:43.057 --> 48:45.475
<i>What a sweetheart,
that girl.</i>

48:45.559 --> 48:47.811
So, Kennedy, what do you
think of our little town?

48:47.895 --> 48:50.763
I like it. Especially what
you're doing for those kids.

48:50.815 --> 48:52.899
<i>Well, we're hoping
for the best.</i>

48:52.950 --> 48:54.701
For the last couple years,

48:54.735 --> 48:56.986
Charlie Whalen's been letting
the kids camp out at his ranch,

48:57.071 --> 48:59.155
but he's been laid up ever since
that horse of his threw him,

48:59.240 --> 49:01.958
and I'm... I'm having a hard
time recruiting anybody else.

49:03.744 --> 49:04.944
<i>Pastor Morgan?</i>

49:04.995 --> 49:06.612
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but the cookout's

49:06.664 --> 49:08.164
just about to start.

49:08.249 --> 49:09.332
Robin, what would
I do without you?

49:09.416 --> 49:11.334
Thank you so much.

49:11.418 --> 49:13.503
-Have the two of you met?
-No.

49:13.587 --> 49:15.755
Robin.
This is Kennedy Blaine.

49:15.806 --> 49:17.640
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

49:17.725 --> 49:20.059
Kennedy is one of
the Circle Cross Blaines.

49:21.645 --> 49:22.979
I heard you were in town.

49:23.063 --> 49:24.647
I understand
the ranch is for sale.

49:24.732 --> 49:27.016
Robin works with the
State Historical Society.

49:27.101 --> 49:28.518
Well,
nothing's final yet.

49:28.602 --> 49:30.186
I'm still going through
the paperwork.

49:30.271 --> 49:32.471
Well.

49:32.523 --> 49:35.191
You and I need to talk.

49:35.276 --> 49:38.077
But first, we have
to get to that cook-off.

49:38.112 --> 49:40.914
Yes, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

49:40.948 --> 49:42.665
We'll see you soon, "cuz."

49:46.287 --> 49:47.504
See you soon.

49:51.625 --> 49:53.543
Looks like you and Pastor
Morgan hit it off.

49:53.627 --> 49:54.711
We did.

49:54.795 --> 49:56.930
He is such
a lovely man.

49:56.964 --> 49:59.215
He told me about
the trouble they're having

49:59.300 --> 50:01.351
finding a campsite
for the inner city kids.

50:01.435 --> 50:03.836
What do you mean, what about
Charlie Whalen's ranch?

50:03.888 --> 50:05.305
I guess he can't do it.

50:06.473 --> 50:07.857
That's a shame.

50:07.942 --> 50:10.276
I was actually thinking

50:10.311 --> 50:12.812
maybe they could come
to Circle Cross.

50:12.863 --> 50:14.063
What do you think?

50:14.148 --> 50:16.316
-I think that's a great idea.
-Absolutely.

50:16.367 --> 50:18.234
I mean, you guys have
so much on your plates...

50:18.319 --> 50:19.569
-Kennedy, look... No, no, no.
-No.

50:19.653 --> 50:21.371
This is what we do,
okay?

50:21.455 --> 50:24.324
Just... whatever you need,
just let us know.

50:24.375 --> 50:26.159
Thank you.

50:26.210 --> 50:27.577
No, thank you.

50:27.661 --> 50:29.528
I mean, if you're free
we can take a ride.

50:29.580 --> 50:30.630
Pick out a campsite.

50:30.664 --> 50:32.549
-You don't mess around.
-No, ma'am.

50:34.335 --> 50:37.587
All right. I'll go tell
Pastor Morgan.

50:37.671 --> 50:39.756
-I'm excited.
-Me too.

50:42.977 --> 50:46.396
She's about to make
some kids very happy.

50:46.480 --> 50:48.181
More than she
will ever know.

50:49.984 --> 50:51.317
You like her, don't you?

51:13.791 --> 51:15.574
Lily Ann?

51:15.626 --> 51:17.677
She was Alexander Blaine's
daughter.

51:18.879 --> 51:20.546
She was just a child.

51:20.598 --> 51:22.682
I know.

51:22.716 --> 51:25.969
There was this outbreak
of cholera that year.

51:26.053 --> 51:28.021
They say that whatever
hope there may have been

51:28.055 --> 51:31.090
of the Blaines and Morgans
patching things up,

51:31.141 --> 51:32.976
it was lost after
John Morgan refused

51:33.060 --> 51:36.312
to come to her funeral.

51:36.397 --> 51:38.731
My parents never told me
that story growing up.

51:38.782 --> 51:40.599
Well, It's not the kind
of story you can tell

51:40.651 --> 51:41.985
a little girl, right?

51:43.404 --> 51:45.488
I guess not.

51:45.572 --> 51:48.107
But it's not the way
it works, is it?

51:48.158 --> 51:51.544
I mean, you can't just
tell the good parts.

51:51.578 --> 51:52.629
All that anger,

51:52.713 --> 51:53.997
and bitterness.

51:54.081 --> 51:55.798
<i>It's part of
the story, too.</i>

52:00.471 --> 52:02.288
<i>You know more
about my family than I do.</i>

52:02.339 --> 52:04.590
<i>-No.
-Yeah. It's a little embarrassing.</i>

52:04.642 --> 52:05.975
<i>No, no, no, you
shouldn't feel that way.</i>

52:06.060 --> 52:08.227
I mean, I just know
the history of the land.

52:08.262 --> 52:09.646
It just happens to be
your family's land,

52:09.730 --> 52:11.397
that's it.

52:11.432 --> 52:14.600
Everything out here
is so untouched.

52:14.652 --> 52:17.186
It's so different
from the city.

52:17.271 --> 52:18.438
It's like you
can sense exactly

52:18.489 --> 52:21.991
how people felt
a hundred years ago.

52:22.076 --> 52:25.445
It makes me feel...

52:25.496 --> 52:26.863
I don't know,

52:26.947 --> 52:27.864
Connected?

52:27.948 --> 52:29.582
-No way.
-No, yeah. Exactly.

52:29.616 --> 52:34.754
It's like you feel you're part of
something bigger than you, right?

52:34.788 --> 52:37.423
Did you feel different when
your parents brought you here?

52:38.625 --> 52:40.343
What?

52:40.427 --> 52:43.496
Your mom told me.
About Chicago.

52:43.547 --> 52:45.998
"About Chicago" what?
What was it?

52:46.050 --> 52:47.800
Nothing, I mean...

52:47.851 --> 52:49.552
she said you
weren't happy there.

52:52.056 --> 52:53.839
I'm sorry, did I say
something wrong?

52:53.891 --> 52:56.609
No, it's just...
just something

52:56.643 --> 52:59.178
I don't like to talk
about, that's it.

52:59.229 --> 53:01.698
-Why not?
-Just don't, okay?

53:01.782 --> 53:03.149
We should start back.

53:04.318 --> 53:05.618
Okay.

53:26.173 --> 53:28.174
<i>Sure beats
the streets, D?</i>

53:33.847 --> 53:35.148
What do you want?

53:35.182 --> 53:37.233
Now, is that any way
to greet an old friend

53:37.317 --> 53:39.885
from Chicago
after all these years?

53:39.937 --> 53:42.855
We're not friends.
We never were.

53:42.906 --> 53:45.158
Boy, we had some times,
didn't we, D?

53:45.192 --> 53:46.659
You was a wild man.

53:46.693 --> 53:47.827
You remember that night?

53:47.861 --> 53:50.446
'Cause I do,
for the last 15 years.

53:50.531 --> 53:51.864
You put yourself
in that prison, not me.

53:51.915 --> 53:54.450
-You shot that guy.
-The way I remember it,

53:54.535 --> 53:56.235
you was supposed to have
my back that night.

53:56.286 --> 53:58.755
-That was the deal.
-I told you I wasn't coming.

53:58.839 --> 54:00.339
I told you I was done
with all of that.

54:00.374 --> 54:02.875
No. The way I see it,

54:02.926 --> 54:04.177
you owe me.

54:06.180 --> 54:07.130
What're you talking about?

54:07.214 --> 54:08.798
I could've turned
you in that night

54:08.882 --> 54:11.100
And you'd have spent
the last 15 years

54:11.185 --> 54:12.769
in a cell next to me.

54:12.853 --> 54:14.771
So that's what
this is all about?

54:14.855 --> 54:15.888
You're trying
to shake me down

54:15.939 --> 54:17.523
for something that happened
when I was a kid?

54:17.558 --> 54:19.258
Something
I didn't even do?

54:19.309 --> 54:21.360
You're wasting
your time.

54:21.395 --> 54:23.312
Well, you gotta
ask yourself, D.

54:23.397 --> 54:26.232
What would all your
God-fearing neighbors think

54:26.283 --> 54:28.284
<i>if those type
of rumors got around?</i>

54:28.368 --> 54:30.036
I say that's gotta
be worth something.

54:30.070 --> 54:31.571
<i>50 thousand?</i>

54:31.622 --> 54:32.938
What do you say?

54:32.990 --> 54:34.991
Even if I was willing
to pay you off,

54:35.075 --> 54:37.610
which I'm not,

54:37.661 --> 54:38.828
I don't have
that kind of money.

54:38.912 --> 54:40.880
Yeah, but your
pretty boss does.

54:40.914 --> 54:42.165
I see you riding.

54:42.249 --> 54:43.716
I've been watching you two

54:43.750 --> 54:45.251
getting all cozy.

54:45.302 --> 54:47.336
She wouldn't mind selling
a couple horses

54:47.421 --> 54:49.338
to help you out.

54:49.423 --> 54:50.973
We're done talking.

54:51.058 --> 54:53.976
You know what? Maybe you
better look at it another way.

54:54.061 --> 54:56.262
<i>Don't look at this
as a pay-off.</i>

54:56.313 --> 54:59.515
Maybe you should look
at this as health insurance.

54:59.600 --> 55:01.734
To ensure that
nobody gets hurt.

55:08.408 --> 55:10.860
You get off of this ranch
and never come back.

55:35.958 --> 55:37.092
<i>A person
would have to be a fool</i>

55:37.160 --> 55:39.461
<i>to sell a place like this.</i>

55:39.512 --> 55:40.796
<i>It makes me feel...</i>

55:42.799 --> 55:43.998
<i>I don't know...</i>

55:44.050 --> 55:45.550
<i>Connected?</i>

55:45.635 --> 55:46.551
<i>-No way.
-No, yeah.</i>

55:46.636 --> 55:48.303
<i>Exactly.
It's like,</i>

55:48.354 --> 55:51.390
<i>you feel you're part of something
bigger than you, right?</i>

56:26.809 --> 56:28.343
Neat.

56:40.606 --> 56:41.723
They're a little excited.

56:52.001 --> 56:53.585
Hey, nice hat.

56:56.706 --> 56:58.039
Hi!

57:01.294 --> 57:02.294
Hey.

57:02.378 --> 57:04.412
All right.
How you doing today?

57:04.464 --> 57:05.514
Good!

57:05.548 --> 57:07.432
<i>-You guys happy?
-Yeah!</i>

57:07.517 --> 57:09.718
<i>-Yeah, who wants to go on a ride?
-Me!</i>

57:09.769 --> 57:10.719
Let's go there.

57:13.105 --> 57:15.524
<i>Just follow
the ladies. There you go.</i>

57:18.227 --> 57:19.394
<i>Thank you.</i>

57:55.815 --> 57:57.065
<i>So they
might not look pretty,</i>

57:57.099 --> 57:59.100
<i>but they sure taste good.</i>

57:59.151 --> 58:01.520
All right, guys.
Go wild.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.690
Hey, this is
a great thing

58:05.775 --> 58:07.859
you're doing here.

58:07.944 --> 58:10.412
I couldn't have
done it without you.

58:26.963 --> 58:28.797
Hey.

58:28.848 --> 58:30.098
Wanna give it a shot?

58:31.634 --> 58:33.468
Nah, I'm good.

58:35.805 --> 58:37.138
Let me guess...

58:37.189 --> 58:40.008
they said, "All the fresh
air will do you good",

58:40.059 --> 58:42.861
but everything just
smells weird, right?

58:42.945 --> 58:44.813
Can you do me a favor?

58:44.864 --> 58:45.847
Go be someone else's
best friend.

58:45.898 --> 58:47.515
<i>I'm doing just fine.</i>

58:47.567 --> 58:48.850
First time I came here,

58:48.901 --> 58:50.201
I held my nose
for two days.

58:50.286 --> 58:51.786
Can you believe that?

58:53.155 --> 58:54.823
And at night... gosh.

58:54.874 --> 58:56.908
At night, it's so silent

58:56.993 --> 58:58.627
It's like you can
hear the grass grow.

59:00.329 --> 59:02.831
I thought I was
gonna go crazy.

59:04.500 --> 59:05.584
When I was your age,

59:05.668 --> 59:08.637
I used to live
in the city.

59:08.671 --> 59:10.088
Basically, I grew up
being tossed

59:10.172 --> 59:12.807
from foster home
to foster home.

59:15.061 --> 59:16.678
For whatever reason,
life just kept

59:16.729 --> 59:18.179
kicking me around...

59:20.683 --> 59:22.884
'til I came here.

59:24.353 --> 59:27.238
And after I held
my nose for two days,

59:27.323 --> 59:29.491
I finally allowed
myself to just...

59:31.360 --> 59:33.528
try it.

59:34.664 --> 59:36.498
A new life grabbed me

59:37.917 --> 59:40.035
and I grabbed it back.

59:40.086 --> 59:42.587
City slicker turned...
Turned tree-hugger?

59:44.707 --> 59:46.625
Must be my genes.

59:46.709 --> 59:48.043
That's cool.

59:49.045 --> 59:51.513
I'm Derek, by the way.

59:51.547 --> 59:53.014
Danny.

59:53.049 --> 59:54.349
<i>Great
to meet you, man.</i>

59:54.383 --> 59:56.584
<i>Yeah,
nice to meet you, too.</i>

59:56.636 --> 59:59.688
One day, you'll find it.

59:59.722 --> 01:00:01.473
Just be open, man.

01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:17.939
<i>Hey.</i>

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:19.491
Hey.

01:00:21.077 --> 01:00:23.328
<i>The kids are all asleep.</i>

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.382
It was a big day,
I bet they're super tired.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:31.503
You know,
the counselors all said

01:00:31.587 --> 01:00:33.805
Danny never
talks to anyone.

01:00:33.889 --> 01:00:36.841
He just...
sits by himself.

01:00:38.644 --> 01:00:42.514
But he talks to you.

01:00:42.598 --> 01:00:45.517
Well, I used to be
just like him.

01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:49.904
What do you mean?

01:00:49.939 --> 01:00:51.990
That's the thing
I don't like to talk about.

01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:56.945
You brought it up.

01:01:06.005 --> 01:01:08.289
When my biological mother
brought me to this country,

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:10.458
she gave me up for adoption.

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:16.514
So I guess I grew up
in the city as a...

01:01:16.599 --> 01:01:18.717
an angry kid.

01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:21.352
I don't know.
I would...

01:01:21.437 --> 01:01:23.021
I would steal
things I didn't want.

01:01:23.105 --> 01:01:26.107
I would hurt people
I didn't know.

01:01:26.142 --> 01:01:28.610
Just this dumb kid running
straight to the cliff,

01:01:28.644 --> 01:01:30.979
not caring how far I'd fall...

01:01:33.866 --> 01:01:37.819
until I met my true mother.

01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:40.521
June.

01:01:40.573 --> 01:01:43.041
She never lost her faith.

01:01:45.628 --> 01:01:47.412
And that's when
she brought you here.

01:01:47.496 --> 01:01:49.581
To Valentine.

01:01:49.665 --> 01:01:52.550
That night she told me,
she said, "We're going home."

01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:56.838
I didn't know what
she was talking about.

01:01:56.889 --> 01:02:00.175
"Home"?
What is that?

01:02:00.226 --> 01:02:04.896
The city was the only
home I ever knew.

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:06.931
But the look on her face,

01:02:08.684 --> 01:02:11.352
I realized she wasn't
gonna give up on me.

01:02:13.823 --> 01:02:14.856
Somehow, she believed

01:02:14.907 --> 01:02:17.659
I could be a son
to be proud of.

01:02:23.616 --> 01:02:25.834
I couldn't
hurt her anymore.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.172
That night, I was
supposed to meet someone.

01:02:31.207 --> 01:02:33.792
We were gonna,
I don't know,

01:02:33.876 --> 01:02:37.128
break into this
warehouse, whatever.

01:02:37.213 --> 01:02:39.130
So I call him,
I tell him...

01:02:39.215 --> 01:02:41.132
I tell him I wasn't going.

01:02:41.217 --> 01:02:43.768
But he did it anyway.

01:02:43.853 --> 01:02:48.106
It turns out, there was someone
working late that night.

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:49.774
And this guy shot him.

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:53.027
And he went
to prison for it.

01:02:56.732 --> 01:02:58.616
Derek.

01:02:58.701 --> 01:03:03.321
Whoever you were,
whatever you did,

01:03:03.405 --> 01:03:06.074
that's all behind you now.

01:03:21.924 --> 01:03:23.675
-Derek.
-The man with the scar,

01:03:23.759 --> 01:03:25.894
his name is Ray Lizzaro.

01:03:25.928 --> 01:03:27.795
He spent his
last 15 years in jail

01:03:27.847 --> 01:03:30.181
and he still blames me
'cause I wasn't there.

01:03:32.351 --> 01:03:34.519
What does he want?

01:03:34.603 --> 01:03:36.521
It doesn't matter
what he wants.

01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:40.191
Look, Kennedy.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:45.613
June and the Circle Cross

01:03:45.664 --> 01:03:47.498
saved my life.

01:03:48.784 --> 01:03:53.037
That's all that matters.

01:03:53.122 --> 01:03:57.542
I never told this
to anyone.

01:03:57.626 --> 01:04:00.094
I'm glad you're
telling me.

01:04:16.445 --> 01:04:19.864
The kids.

01:04:19.949 --> 01:04:21.316
The kids.

01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:32.794
All right.

01:04:35.047 --> 01:04:37.165
Come and get it.

01:04:37.216 --> 01:04:38.199
Grab your plates.

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:40.051
All right.
Who's first?

01:04:40.135 --> 01:04:41.920
There you go.

01:04:42.004 --> 01:04:43.304
It's over here
if you want to bring...

01:04:45.007 --> 01:04:46.891
<i>Watch out.</i>

01:04:46.976 --> 01:04:49.727
-It's hot, guys.
-Got your eggs?

01:04:52.181 --> 01:04:53.681
There you go.

01:05:06.612 --> 01:05:09.330
All right, everybody.
Group photo!

01:05:09.365 --> 01:05:11.282
Come on in.

01:05:11.367 --> 01:05:13.117
Come on.

01:05:13.202 --> 01:05:15.286
All right.

01:05:15.371 --> 01:05:16.604
Hey, Danny.

01:05:19.591 --> 01:05:21.009
Everyone.

01:05:22.928 --> 01:05:25.430
All right.
One, two, three.

01:05:25.514 --> 01:05:27.882
-Cheese!
-Banana!

01:06:16.163 --> 01:06:17.464
<i>The first thing I wanna do</i>

01:06:17.498 --> 01:06:19.799
is take a long,
hot shower.

01:06:19.834 --> 01:06:22.502
I smell like a campfire.

01:06:22.553 --> 01:06:25.588
You know, I like
the smell of campfire.

01:06:27.007 --> 01:06:28.308
<i>Well, look at you.</i>

01:06:30.227 --> 01:06:32.262
Steve.

01:06:32.346 --> 01:06:33.763
You're a real cowgirl, now.

01:06:33.848 --> 01:06:35.047
What're you
doing here?

01:06:35.099 --> 01:06:37.100
Well, I've been
calling and texting.

01:06:37.184 --> 01:06:39.185
<i>I mean, I haven't
heard from you in days.</i>

01:06:39.236 --> 01:06:40.603
I was beginning to worry.

01:06:40.688 --> 01:06:44.574
We were camping with
some kids from the city.

01:06:44.658 --> 01:06:45.992
<i>I turned off my phone.</i>

01:06:46.026 --> 01:06:47.827
Just as long as you're okay.

01:06:47.862 --> 01:06:50.663
And besides,

01:06:50.698 --> 01:06:52.031
I missed you.

01:06:55.369 --> 01:06:56.786
This is Derek Sterling.

01:06:56.871 --> 01:06:58.254
<i>Derek, Steve Marrin.</i>

01:06:58.339 --> 01:07:00.707
You must be the cowboy
I heard so much about.

01:07:00.758 --> 01:07:02.125
<i>Thanks for taking
such good care of her.</i>

01:07:02.209 --> 01:07:03.676
<i>Just doing my job.</i>

01:07:08.849 --> 01:07:10.216
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:07:14.054 --> 01:07:15.388
Nice meeting you.

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:31.070
I think we should talk.

01:08:28.761 --> 01:08:30.830
<i>Where's your friend?</i>

01:08:30.881 --> 01:08:33.216
On his way back
to California.

01:08:35.135 --> 01:08:36.935
That's too bad.

01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:38.270
Look, I should've
seen it coming.

01:08:38.305 --> 01:08:39.839
-Steve's a nice...
-Look, it's too bad

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:41.841
because this, you and me,

01:08:41.892 --> 01:08:44.143
whatever this is,
it's not gonna work.

01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:46.446
What?

01:08:46.513 --> 01:08:47.479
Look, I'm really happy

01:08:47.531 --> 01:08:49.064
with all the good things
you wanna do here,

01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:51.401
and I'm gonna help you
in any way I can,

01:08:51.484 --> 01:08:54.404
but you're a lawyer.

01:08:54.488 --> 01:08:56.906
I'm a... ranch hand.

01:08:56.991 --> 01:08:59.042
You're a wealthy girl,

01:08:59.126 --> 01:09:01.544
I'm your employee.

01:09:01.629 --> 01:09:05.163
This ranch is the only
thing we have in common.

01:09:05.215 --> 01:09:06.416
You have a really
important life

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.718
outside of all
of this, I know.

01:09:10.504 --> 01:09:12.705
This is all I have.

01:09:12.756 --> 01:09:14.140
All I got.

01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:17.810
All I want.

01:09:23.517 --> 01:09:25.484
So, let's just...

01:09:25.519 --> 01:09:27.487
let's just forget about it.

01:10:00.554 --> 01:10:02.305
Talbot, you're working late.

01:10:02.389 --> 01:10:04.023
<i>Looks like
your cowboy friend</i>

01:10:04.058 --> 01:10:05.591
<i>knew what he was
talking about.</i>

01:10:05.659 --> 01:10:08.928
Circle Cross has been
making money all along.

01:10:08.979 --> 01:10:13.149
<i>And Smith Blaine has been
skimming for a long time.</i>

01:10:13.233 --> 01:10:14.433
How'd he do it?

01:10:14.485 --> 01:10:17.570
Some months he double-billed
for his time.

01:10:17.621 --> 01:10:19.956
<i>He took commissions
on horse sales</i>

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.290
<i>that never happened.</i>

01:10:21.375 --> 01:10:23.960
<i>Inflated the tax bill,
pocketing the difference.</i>

01:10:24.044 --> 01:10:26.129
So much for family ties.

01:10:26.213 --> 01:10:27.914
<i>Those offers
for the ranch?</i>

01:10:27.965 --> 01:10:31.668
They're coming from a big
development company in Denver.

01:10:31.752 --> 01:10:33.636
Development?

01:10:33.721 --> 01:10:35.254
And guess who's
on their payroll?

01:10:48.185 --> 01:10:50.269
You can't do this.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.571
I just did.

01:10:51.605 --> 01:10:54.140
My lawyer's drafting the
letter to make it official.

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:56.976
But I wanted to tell you
myself, in person,

01:10:57.044 --> 01:10:58.845
you're fired.

01:11:00.114 --> 01:11:01.831
You know, I worked
for your father

01:11:01.915 --> 01:11:03.533
for over five years.

01:11:03.617 --> 01:11:05.668
I gave him
a complete set of records

01:11:05.753 --> 01:11:07.503
of everything I did.

01:11:07.588 --> 01:11:09.505
<i>You stfrom him
for five years,</i>

01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:11.190
and those records are proof.

01:11:11.258 --> 01:11:12.842
That's ridiculous.

01:11:12.926 --> 01:11:14.844
Derek kept his own records
of the ranch.

01:11:14.928 --> 01:11:17.496
We can document every penny
you put in your pocket.

01:11:17.548 --> 01:11:19.348
You're gonna take the word
of some ranch hand?

01:11:19.433 --> 01:11:21.050
I trust
that ranch hand

01:11:21.135 --> 01:11:23.052
a lot more than
I could ever trust you.

01:11:23.137 --> 01:11:24.721
This isn't over, Kennedy.

01:11:24.805 --> 01:11:28.274
You're right,
there's one more thing.

01:11:28.308 --> 01:11:31.394
You have 30 days to pay back
the money you stole,

01:11:31.478 --> 01:11:33.279
or I'll press charges.

01:11:34.481 --> 01:11:36.149
You're fooling yourself,
you know.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.451
That ranch is
a thing of the past.

01:11:38.485 --> 01:11:40.186
<i>Sooner or later,
it'll start losing money.</i>

01:11:40.237 --> 01:11:41.520
<i>They all do.</i>

01:11:41.572 --> 01:11:43.906
Be smart, Kennedy.

01:11:43.991 --> 01:11:47.410
Take the offer
before it's too late.

01:11:47.494 --> 01:11:50.213
You can tear up that offer,

01:11:50.297 --> 01:11:51.581
along with any other.

01:11:51.665 --> 01:11:54.967
Because the Circle Cross
is not for sale.

01:11:56.336 --> 01:11:57.637
30 days.

01:12:38.011 --> 01:12:40.847
Hi, I'm looking
for Robin Donovan.

01:12:42.182 --> 01:12:43.549
Thank you.

01:12:46.937 --> 01:12:48.888
<i>Robin.</i>

01:12:48.939 --> 01:12:51.140
-Kennedy.
-Hello.

01:12:51.225 --> 01:12:53.109
I have been meaning
to catch up with you.

01:12:53.193 --> 01:12:54.477
How's everything
at the ranch?

01:12:54.561 --> 01:12:55.812
Good. Yeah.

01:12:55.896 --> 01:12:56.813
That's,

01:12:56.897 --> 01:12:58.397
that's actually
why I'm here.

01:12:58.448 --> 01:13:01.150
Is there somewhere
we can talk privately?

01:13:01.235 --> 01:13:03.435
Sure. This way.

01:13:45.863 --> 01:13:46.979
What?

01:13:47.047 --> 01:13:48.531
Pardon me, Mr. Morgan.

01:13:48.615 --> 01:13:50.199
Smith Blaine is here.

01:13:50.284 --> 01:13:52.084
He says it's important.

01:13:52.119 --> 01:13:54.537
Another visitor
from the Blaine family.

01:13:54.621 --> 01:13:56.255
I must be living right.

01:13:57.958 --> 01:14:00.509
Well, what do you want?

01:14:05.098 --> 01:14:06.515
Well, this part
of the country

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.018
used to be covered
by tall grass prairie,

01:14:09.102 --> 01:14:10.686
most of which
was farmed under.

01:14:10.771 --> 01:14:13.389
The National Register
wants to preserve what's left.

01:14:13.473 --> 01:14:14.857
I went to see
Robin Donovan

01:14:14.942 --> 01:14:17.360
and she explained it to me.

01:14:17.444 --> 01:14:19.362
Basically,
the National Register

01:14:19.446 --> 01:14:21.063
works with state societies

01:14:21.148 --> 01:14:23.849
to find places with
historic significance

01:14:23.901 --> 01:14:25.735
so they can preserve them.

01:14:25.819 --> 01:14:27.236
And they think that
the Circle Cross

01:14:27.321 --> 01:14:28.571
<i>hashistoricsignificance?</i>

01:14:28.655 --> 01:14:32.074
I mean, with the cemetery,
and the wagon trail,

01:14:32.159 --> 01:14:34.827
and all those other stories,
there's no question.

01:14:34.878 --> 01:14:37.747
So the whole ranch would be
on the National Register?

01:14:37.831 --> 01:14:40.883
Yeah, I mean, there's
still some paperwork.

01:14:40.968 --> 01:14:43.586
And, you know, some hoops
to jump through.

01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:45.087
But Robin thinks
we have a real shot.

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.391
So, if they do
want the ranch,

01:14:48.475 --> 01:14:51.510
then, how soon
would we have to move?

01:14:54.481 --> 01:14:56.515
You won't have to move.

01:14:56.566 --> 01:14:58.851
See, that's the whole point.

01:14:58.902 --> 01:15:03.239
The ranch will go on
with you and Derek

01:15:03.323 --> 01:15:04.907
just the way it is.

01:15:04.992 --> 01:15:06.158
In perpetuity.

01:15:07.995 --> 01:15:11.280
But, according to this,

01:15:11.365 --> 01:15:13.499
<i>it also means you can
neversell the ranch.</i>

01:15:16.036 --> 01:15:18.170
I mean, it's a lot of money
to be giving up.

01:15:19.373 --> 01:15:21.173
"A person would have
to be a fool

01:15:21.208 --> 01:15:24.010
to sell a place like this."

01:15:27.514 --> 01:15:28.597
Thank you.

01:15:28.682 --> 01:15:30.299
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:15:35.389 --> 01:15:37.139
Thank you.

01:16:02.582 --> 01:16:04.300
Come on, Wilson.

01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:08.254
Okay.

01:16:15.762 --> 01:16:17.730
Derek?

01:16:23.937 --> 01:16:25.071
No!

01:16:25.105 --> 01:16:27.189
Don't make a move.

01:16:49.129 --> 01:16:50.346
Hey, Derek.

01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:52.715
Hey, I think something's
going on with Wilson.

01:16:52.799 --> 01:16:54.183
He's barking like crazy.

01:17:14.287 --> 01:17:16.205
Kennedy!

01:17:17.741 --> 01:17:19.041
Wilson!

01:17:21.795 --> 01:17:23.379
What's wrong, boy?
What's...

01:17:32.672 --> 01:17:35.374
<i>Hey, just like
old times, D?</i>

01:17:35.425 --> 01:17:37.510
I give the orders,
you follow.

01:17:37.561 --> 01:17:39.378
You let her go, okay?

01:17:39.446 --> 01:17:41.046
Sure thing, D.

01:17:41.114 --> 01:17:42.948
But first I'm gonna need
some traveling money.

01:17:43.016 --> 01:17:44.900
You know, the figure
we discussed.

01:17:44.985 --> 01:17:47.403
<i>And I figure, you being
the ranch foreman,</i>

01:17:47.487 --> 01:17:49.772
you got access to cash
just in case of emergency.

01:17:49.856 --> 01:17:51.574
-Look, listen to me...
-No, you listen to me!

01:17:51.658 --> 01:17:53.559
You know me,
and you know what I can do.

01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:54.743
<i>So don't be stupid.</i>

01:17:54.828 --> 01:17:56.495
<i>Get the money.
No cops.</i>

01:17:56.530 --> 01:17:59.532
And meet me back at the
lake house in one hour.

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:01.617
Lizzaro, I...

01:18:06.506 --> 01:18:08.624
Boy, look.
Find her, okay?

01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:11.460
Let's go.
Let's go. Find her.

01:18:11.545 --> 01:18:13.846
Let's go, boy.
Go, Wilson.

01:18:48.131 --> 01:18:49.832
Help!

01:18:49.916 --> 01:18:51.350
Somebody help me!

01:18:56.506 --> 01:18:58.174
Somebody!

01:18:59.259 --> 01:19:01.093
Somebody help!
Please!

01:19:29.456 --> 01:19:31.757
<i>-Kennedy!
-Derek?</i>

01:19:37.297 --> 01:19:40.216
15 years I sat in
that prison 'cause of you.

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.218
You owe me.

01:19:42.302 --> 01:19:44.136
And if I can't
get paid one way,

01:19:44.187 --> 01:19:46.171
then I get paid
another way.

01:19:46.223 --> 01:19:47.773
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:19:48.808 --> 01:19:50.392
Please.
Please.

01:19:50.477 --> 01:19:52.678
-You don't have to do this.
-Shut up.

01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:54.230
I got nothing to lose,

01:19:54.314 --> 01:19:55.898
but you do.

01:20:22.425 --> 01:20:24.843
Get him off me!

01:20:26.479 --> 01:20:29.431
<i>Get him off me!
Okay! All right!</i>

01:20:29.516 --> 01:20:31.233
<i>-Get him off me!
-Please be okay.</i>

01:20:32.569 --> 01:20:34.937
<i>Get him off me!
Okay! All right!</i>

01:20:35.021 --> 01:20:36.355
<i>Get him off me!</i>

01:20:36.406 --> 01:20:38.857
<i>Get him off me!</i>

01:20:51.504 --> 01:20:53.088
You're sure you're okay?

01:20:53.173 --> 01:20:55.207
Yeah, I think so.

01:20:55.258 --> 01:20:57.543
I'm so sorry.

01:20:57.594 --> 01:20:59.845
<i>-Hey, it wasn't your fault.
-Itwasmy fault.</i>

01:20:59.879 --> 01:21:01.630
Okay? I should've
known Lizzaro

01:21:01.715 --> 01:21:03.549
wouldn't just let it go.

01:21:05.268 --> 01:21:08.137
<i>Do you think
we've seen the last of him?</i>

01:21:08.221 --> 01:21:10.139
They said he's going
right back to prison.

01:21:11.441 --> 01:21:14.026
This time for good.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:43.922
You've been stirring up
quite a hornet's nest

01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:45.524
<i>around here lately.</i>

01:21:45.592 --> 01:21:49.628
<i>Coming into town,
moving onto the ranch.</i>

01:21:49.679 --> 01:21:52.348
Going on about
the National Register.

01:21:53.733 --> 01:21:55.768
You seem to know
an awful lot about me.

01:21:55.819 --> 01:21:59.355
I know an awful lot
about everything.

01:21:59.439 --> 01:22:01.857
That's what comes with
spending your whole life

01:22:01.941 --> 01:22:03.409
<i>in one town.</i>

01:22:04.778 --> 01:22:06.161
What do you want?

01:22:12.702 --> 01:22:15.003
<i>Smith Blaine came
to see me the other day.</i>

01:22:15.088 --> 01:22:17.489
<i>I haven't talked
to him in years.</i>

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:21.877
<i>All of a sudden he's got
this proposition for me.</i>

01:22:23.263 --> 01:22:24.680
What kind of proposition?

01:22:24.764 --> 01:22:26.682
Well, he wants me
to team up with him

01:22:26.766 --> 01:22:29.468
to contest your inheritance.

01:22:29.519 --> 01:22:32.221
<i>Figures he can
tie it up in court.</i>

01:22:32.305 --> 01:22:34.139
<i>Wear you down.</i>

01:22:34.190 --> 01:22:38.894
Eventually build that little
golf course of his, after all.

01:22:38.978 --> 01:22:41.480
<i>Offered me 30% ownership.</i>

01:22:43.316 --> 01:22:44.616
What'd you say?

01:22:46.486 --> 01:22:49.488
I told him I don't
do business with Blaines.

01:22:49.539 --> 01:22:52.190
<i>Never have, never will.</i>

01:22:52.242 --> 01:22:53.909
Besides, the man's a crook.

01:22:53.993 --> 01:22:55.661
Yeah, I know.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.330
I fired him.

01:22:58.381 --> 01:23:00.082
Good for you.

01:23:05.805 --> 01:23:08.557
Never came to see us.

01:23:08.641 --> 01:23:12.094
Never called,
never wrote.

01:23:14.848 --> 01:23:17.149
Didn't you ever, once...

01:23:18.351 --> 01:23:20.352
just want to know me?

01:23:20.403 --> 01:23:23.322
I told your mother
when she left.

01:23:25.692 --> 01:23:27.392
It was a Blaine.

01:23:27.444 --> 01:23:29.227
And she was a Morgan.

01:23:29.279 --> 01:23:31.113
<i>Did you really think
she was gonna let</i>

01:23:31.197 --> 01:23:32.564
<i>somebody else
tell her what to do?</i>

01:23:32.615 --> 01:23:34.917
How to live her life?

01:23:36.953 --> 01:23:38.370
Did she ever forgive me?

01:23:41.424 --> 01:23:42.541
She did.

01:23:42.592 --> 01:23:44.460
<i>Over time.</i>

01:23:47.514 --> 01:23:49.765
But I think it would
mean more to her now

01:23:49.816 --> 01:23:51.316
<i>if you forgave you</i>

01:23:53.603 --> 01:23:56.405
You always tell yourself
there's plenty of time.

01:23:59.409 --> 01:24:02.077
But time goes by so fast.

01:24:04.113 --> 01:24:05.948
Don't ever put
things off, girl.

01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:09.418
<i>Don't ever wait to say
what needs to be said.</i>

01:24:13.873 --> 01:24:17.092
You're as beautiful
as she was.

01:24:22.098 --> 01:24:25.100
Well, well, well.

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:37.396
Wait.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:39.514
Wait.

01:24:39.566 --> 01:24:40.949
What's this?

01:24:46.155 --> 01:24:50.709
My God.

01:24:50.793 --> 01:24:51.743
Look at that.

01:24:58.501 --> 01:25:00.502
Thank you, Kennedy.

01:25:02.138 --> 01:25:04.723
I don't know
what to call you.

01:25:04.807 --> 01:25:06.592
Call me?

01:25:06.676 --> 01:25:09.928
You might try
hard-nosed old coot.

01:25:14.150 --> 01:25:17.819
Or you can
call me Grandfather.

01:25:19.355 --> 01:25:20.489
Grandfather.

01:25:22.692 --> 01:25:25.027
I like that.

01:25:33.419 --> 01:25:36.288
Hey, buddy.
Hey.

01:25:36.372 --> 01:25:37.673
Hey.

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:42.461
Thank you.

01:25:42.545 --> 01:25:44.680
Thank you for
saving her, okay?

01:25:53.306 --> 01:25:54.556
Derek?

01:26:07.487 --> 01:26:11.606
You were right.
The other day.

01:26:11.658 --> 01:26:14.159
We come from different worlds

01:26:14.243 --> 01:26:16.778
and the lives we've lead up to
now couldn't be further apart,

01:26:16.829 --> 01:26:18.497
but they lead us here.

01:26:18.581 --> 01:26:20.165
Now.

01:26:20.249 --> 01:26:22.668
All those things you said
would drive us apart

01:26:22.752 --> 01:26:24.886
are the same things
that brought us together.

01:26:26.422 --> 01:26:29.841
-This isn't your life, Ke...
-Being here with you?

01:26:32.395 --> 01:26:34.479
This is what I want
my life to be.

01:26:36.432 --> 01:26:39.484
This is where I belong,

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:42.070
and I'm not going anywhere.

01:27:18.975 --> 01:27:20.192
<i>There you go!</i>

01:27:21.778 --> 01:27:22.978
Well done!

01:27:29.986 --> 01:27:31.286
I'm proud of you.

01:27:34.991 --> 01:27:37.125
Look at that.
