WEBVTT

00:01.547 --> 00:02.686
I'm engaged!

00:02.711 --> 00:04.046
That's r... that's really great news, Joss.

00:04.081 --> 00:05.169
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:05.194 --> 00:06.747
Absolutely, you're getting married.

00:06.772 --> 00:08.307
<i>Previously on "Mistresses"... </i>

00:08.341 --> 00:09.908
You seem tense.

00:15.281 --> 00:16.448
How can I contact you?

00:16.482 --> 00:17.615
I'll come up with something...

00:17.650 --> 00:20.207
A way to get in touch if you need me.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.389
Who are you?

00:25.280 --> 00:26.723
I really want to see you again.

00:26.748 --> 00:28.682
Here's my number. Bye, Rebecca.

00:30.963 --> 00:32.397
I need to talk to you about something.

00:35.868 --> 00:37.801
Do you mind if I-I come in?

00:37.836 --> 00:39.937
How did you find out where I lived?

00:39.972 --> 00:41.368
Well, it wasn't easy.

00:42.140 --> 00:43.607
I wasted a lot of time trying to track down

00:43.641 --> 00:45.734
a pediatrician named Rebecca.

00:46.770 --> 00:48.951
You know, most people
just give a fake number.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.374
You really went the extra mile.

00:51.803 --> 00:53.149
- I'm sorry. I...
- It's okay.

00:53.184 --> 00:55.619
I don't blame you for not
wanting to see me again.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.357
That wasn't...

00:57.655 --> 00:59.956
It didn't have anything to
do with you, especially...

00:59.991 --> 01:01.992
Look, it doesn't matter.
It's not why I'm here.

01:03.561 --> 01:05.128
Can I come in?

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.473 --> 01:19.830
So the, uh... The bartender helped me out.

01:20.655 --> 01:22.012
He remembered you.

01:23.495 --> 01:25.381
Look, I want you to know
that I never would have

01:25.416 --> 01:27.937
gone through all the trouble of finding you

01:29.106 --> 01:32.021
if it wasn't really important.

01:32.664 --> 01:33.790
What is it, Ben?

01:34.404 --> 01:35.648
I'm sick.

01:38.538 --> 01:39.661
What do you mean?

01:40.446 --> 01:43.666
I'm not sure how long or who gave it to me.

01:45.201 --> 01:47.293
We should probably go see your doctor.

02:22.404 --> 02:24.372
- [Dog barking in distance]
- Looky here.

02:26.041 --> 02:27.375
What you got?

02:28.721 --> 02:31.078
There's one number already
programmed into the phone.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.013
You sure it came from him?

02:33.047 --> 02:34.582
Who else would it be from?

02:36.117 --> 02:37.518
Are we done now?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.387
We'll be in touch.

02:40.421 --> 02:42.322
[Scoffs]

02:44.826 --> 02:46.126
[Engine turns over]

02:47.535 --> 02:49.503
Mm, you're late.

02:49.528 --> 02:51.252
I still don't understand
what we're doing here.

02:51.277 --> 02:53.079
The engagement party next weekend is like

02:53.104 --> 02:55.544
a dress rehearsal for
the actual wedding, okay?

02:55.569 --> 02:57.670
It gives us an opportunity to iron out

02:57.705 --> 02:59.739
any of the kinks and taste free cake.

02:59.773 --> 03:01.241
Oh, well, then sold.

03:01.266 --> 03:03.276
So, we got three more RSVPs.

03:03.560 --> 03:04.693
Oh, mom?

03:05.746 --> 03:07.007
No. Well, whatever.

03:07.032 --> 03:08.114
If she doesn't show up,

03:08.148 --> 03:10.247
it'll just give me more
time to spend with Eleanor.

03:10.272 --> 03:11.317
Hmm?

03:11.351 --> 03:12.688
- The mom.
- Mm.

03:12.713 --> 03:13.680
Did I tell you we're going

03:13.714 --> 03:15.203
- registry shopping tomorrow?
- Hmm.

03:15.228 --> 03:17.045
We're probably gonna go to
dinner if you want to join us.

03:17.070 --> 03:18.173
Oh, that's sweet,

03:18.198 --> 03:20.377
but I actually have a date with Zack.

03:20.464 --> 03:21.466
Hmm?

03:21.731 --> 03:23.256
Zack asked me out, and I said yes.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.491
Is that gross?

03:24.525 --> 03:26.826
No, it's not gross. What
are you talking about?

03:26.861 --> 03:28.194
You're single. He's hot. I say...

03:28.228 --> 03:30.137
You want to ride that pony, get on it.

03:30.162 --> 03:31.529
- [Groans]
- [Laughs]

03:31.554 --> 03:32.931
Okay, you don't have to ride
the pony. Just go to dinner.

03:32.956 --> 03:34.586
I'm not even sure I want to go to dinner.

03:34.611 --> 03:36.569
- Why?
- I mean, I had a fun time

03:36.594 --> 03:38.604
hanging out with him, but...

03:38.638 --> 03:40.606
Really, should I start dating now?

03:40.640 --> 03:41.659
I'm 40.

03:41.684 --> 03:43.485
So? Switch back.

03:44.646 --> 03:48.138
Well, so, I mean, the
last guy I dated was...

03:48.894 --> 03:51.028
[Sighs] Was Harry.

03:51.484 --> 03:53.018
Hello? Dom.

03:53.052 --> 03:55.174
No, we skipped that part.

03:55.199 --> 03:57.967
We went right from cheaters
to boyfriend and girlfriend.

03:57.992 --> 04:00.194
No, no, no, see, I
prefer the term "lovers."

04:00.219 --> 04:02.020
I don't know. With Harry, it
didn't even feel like dating.

04:02.045 --> 04:03.391
It was all so easy.

04:03.416 --> 04:04.716
Did I ever tell you

04:04.741 --> 04:06.208
that the first time we ever kissed was

04:06.233 --> 04:08.092
- on a surfboard?
- Mnh-mnh.

04:08.117 --> 04:11.533
He was trying to teach me
how to do that pop-up thing.

04:11.558 --> 04:14.503
- Hmm.
- I never actually popped up.

04:14.528 --> 04:16.137
<i>I'll bet he did.</i>

04:17.243 --> 04:20.659
The point is I did not
see my life going this way.

04:20.684 --> 04:23.034
Oh, you know, neither did I.

04:23.288 --> 04:25.756
But maybe that's a good thing, honey.

04:25.781 --> 04:27.216
Just saying.

04:27.930 --> 04:30.271
To a life full of surprises.

04:30.296 --> 04:31.396
And free cake.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.557
- Ding!
- Ding!

04:34.063 --> 04:35.063
I like this one.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.195
- That's my favorite.
- Yeah, me, too.

04:45.270 --> 04:48.143
[Gasps] Whoa, Nellie. Whoa.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.757
Holy... Shish kebab!

04:51.142 --> 04:53.444
Guy never heard of curtains?!

04:53.478 --> 04:54.878
For the love of...

04:54.912 --> 04:56.713
Exactly how much did you see?

04:56.747 --> 04:59.099
Oh, I saw everything, April!

04:59.124 --> 05:00.675
Twig and berries.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.035
Okay, that's a whole lot of Harry.

05:02.060 --> 05:05.315
Oh, and it was a-a-a lot of Harry.

05:05.340 --> 05:06.931
Like, more than average.

05:06.956 --> 05:08.857
Girl, I did not need to know that.

05:08.882 --> 05:09.949
[Both laugh]

05:09.974 --> 05:11.671
Neither did I, but, hey, I'm happy for him.

05:11.696 --> 05:13.888
- Good for Harry.
- Please stop talking now.

05:13.913 --> 05:16.063
- [Bell jingles]
- [Laughing] What?

05:16.137 --> 05:17.371
Hey.

05:18.474 --> 05:20.803
Oh, hey, Karen. You okay?

05:22.069 --> 05:25.194
A man I slept with just
tested H.I.V. positive.

05:25.609 --> 05:27.973
- Oh, my God.
- Jacob?

05:28.014 --> 05:29.891
No. A different man.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.885
Okay, wait, I'm sorry.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.620
W-who else were you sleeping with?

05:41.825 --> 05:43.161
Oh, my God.

05:43.493 --> 05:45.149
This is just like the time you two started

05:45.174 --> 05:46.508
watching "Scandal" without me.

05:46.533 --> 05:51.066
Before Jacob and I got together,
I was going through a phase.

05:51.091 --> 05:52.577
She was having anonymous sex.

05:52.602 --> 05:53.803
She... what?!

05:53.828 --> 05:54.928
I slept with a few men...

05:54.953 --> 05:56.809
men I didn't know, men
who didn't know me...

05:56.834 --> 05:58.135
and now one of them is sick.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.147
You were safe, though, right?

06:00.172 --> 06:03.264
Of course I was, but
there's always a chance.

06:03.948 --> 06:05.082
Oh, my God.

06:05.107 --> 06:07.079
I-I can't believe this is happening.

06:07.104 --> 06:08.864
No, wait. Shh. Hon...
sweetheart, I know you're scared,

06:08.889 --> 06:10.357
but everything's gonna
be fine. Just breathe.

06:10.434 --> 06:11.930
What if I'm not?

06:12.024 --> 06:14.295
What if this is the
universe's way of punishing me?

06:14.320 --> 06:17.868
What I did with those men...
it was... Immoral, shameful.

06:17.893 --> 06:19.194
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:19.219 --> 06:21.527
No, stop right there
before I jezebel your ass.

06:21.552 --> 06:23.821
You listen to me. You are a grown woman.

06:23.846 --> 06:25.680
And if the universe is gonna punish you,

06:25.705 --> 06:27.306
then the universe is a sexist pig.

06:27.331 --> 06:28.731
She's right.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.605
- I don't know.
- Yeah, listen, listen, listen. I do.

06:31.639 --> 06:32.706
You're spinning, Karen.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.708
Just... and I know because I've been there.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.718
You'll feel so much
better once you get tested.

06:36.743 --> 06:38.788
I know a clinic, and they'll
give you fast results, okay?

06:38.813 --> 06:40.948
I think I'd feel more
comfortable with my own doctor.

06:40.982 --> 06:42.824
But thank you. I'll go tomorrow.

06:42.849 --> 06:44.983
[Sighs] Oh, I wish I can go with you,

06:45.008 --> 06:47.143
but I have to go back to
the FBI office tomorrow

06:47.168 --> 06:49.136
so I can help my
not-married ex-boyfriend

06:49.161 --> 06:50.462
find my not-dead ex-husband,

06:50.487 --> 06:52.853
who currently works for
some drug-dealing overlord.

06:53.158 --> 06:55.492
It's insane you don't keep alcohol here.

06:55.633 --> 06:56.664
Seriously.

06:56.689 --> 06:58.747
- [Sighs]
- Seriously.

07:00.717 --> 07:02.632
Thomas: Agent Gordon
pulled the serial number

07:02.657 --> 07:04.291
off the phone that was sent to you

07:04.325 --> 07:06.712
and was able to confirm
it was purchased in Ohio.

07:06.746 --> 07:08.397
So Paul's in Ohio.

07:08.422 --> 07:09.422
Not necessarily.

07:09.664 --> 07:11.464
We've run the phone through our systems,

07:11.498 --> 07:13.033
and it's not been used yet.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.025
No calls incoming or outgoing.

07:15.079 --> 07:16.600
He may have just purchased
the phone in Ohio.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.571
Or somebody else got it for him.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.239
We can't be sure, but the point is

07:20.274 --> 07:22.381
your husband could be
almost anywhere right now.

07:22.406 --> 07:24.255
Stop calling him my husband.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.529
All you have to do is keep
Paul on the line long enough

07:27.591 --> 07:30.620
so agent Gordon here can
pinpoint his exact location.

07:30.645 --> 07:33.114
I'll need about 30 seconds. Maybe less.

07:33.139 --> 07:35.073
Look, the key is just to
keep it conversational.

07:35.098 --> 07:36.061
Keep it light.

07:36.086 --> 07:38.049
If I keep it light, he's
gonna know something is up.

07:38.074 --> 07:40.575
I told him I'd only contact
him in case of an emergency.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.802
You're right. So make up an emergency.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.963
You know, something that matters to him.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.464
- Maybe...
- Make it about your daughter.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.421
- A health issue.
- I get it. I get it.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.403
[Sighs]

07:58.377 --> 08:00.812
- What's gonna happen to him?
- Excuse me?

08:00.837 --> 08:03.983
Once you pinpoint his
location, what's the plan?

08:04.008 --> 08:05.090
What's gonna happen next?

08:05.115 --> 08:06.415
[Sighs] Same as before.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.757
We bring him in. He
testifies against Olivos.

08:08.787 --> 08:11.256
Then after that's done,
we help him establish

08:11.290 --> 08:13.592
a new identity and a
new life somewhere else.

08:13.804 --> 08:15.870
With Miranda and Scottie.

08:15.994 --> 08:17.795
If that's what he wants.

08:20.298 --> 08:21.977
[Sighs]

08:26.646 --> 08:27.784
[Sighs]

08:31.788 --> 08:34.256
[Cellphone beeps]

08:34.280 --> 08:36.115
[Ringing]

08:37.815 --> 08:39.116
<i>Paul: April.</i>

08:39.150 --> 08:41.118
Paul. I...

08:41.152 --> 08:42.953
<i>Keep this phone with you
for the next 48 hours.</i>

08:42.986 --> 08:45.055
<i>I'll contact you when I can.  [Beeping]</i>

08:45.089 --> 08:46.223
What... what just happened?

08:46.258 --> 08:48.079
It was a message. That wasn't him.

08:48.104 --> 08:49.471
[Smack, thud]

09:07.008 --> 09:09.036
[Cellphone chimes] Ooh.

09:11.130 --> 09:13.161
It's Greta. She'll be here soon.

09:13.773 --> 09:15.638
Interesting.

09:16.545 --> 09:18.010
Is it?

09:18.045 --> 09:19.245
Isn't it?

09:20.696 --> 09:22.515
Is there something you'd like to discuss?

09:22.722 --> 09:24.245
Um, yeah.

09:24.270 --> 09:25.776
Are you seriously not gonna tell me

09:25.801 --> 09:27.402
that you're sleeping
with Leggy McVunderface?

09:30.038 --> 09:31.779
Keep your voice down, Joss.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.193
- You're acting inappropriately.
- What?

09:33.218 --> 09:35.380
Says the guy who boinked the boss!

09:35.405 --> 09:37.247
How did this even happen? When? Why?

09:37.272 --> 09:39.105
I need details, like, immediately.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.500
Wow. Okay. Silent treatment.

09:45.525 --> 09:47.259
Must mean you really like her.

09:47.455 --> 09:48.688
Excuse me. Do you really like her?

09:48.713 --> 09:50.514
It's none of your business.

09:51.643 --> 09:54.087
Come on, dude. Since when
do we not talk about stuff?

09:54.112 --> 09:56.065
- I tell you every time I have to pee.
- That's your choice.

09:56.090 --> 09:58.471
I certainly don't ask for
that level of information,

09:58.496 --> 10:00.489
nor am I obligated to
share my life with you

10:00.552 --> 10:03.467
the way you share yours
with... everyone, okay?

10:03.492 --> 10:06.517
Oh, you're talking about the time that
I got all boozy with the uber driver?

10:06.542 --> 10:08.731
Because that was a very
special circumstance.

10:08.756 --> 10:11.508
And he was a really good
listener. I miss Habeeb.

10:11.533 --> 10:13.678
Look, I... it's... I'm totally
fine if you guys keep...

10:13.703 --> 10:14.903
I don't care what you think!

10:15.833 --> 10:17.634
I'm not your girlfriend, Josslyn.

10:17.668 --> 10:19.656
I'm not your family. I'm not
even your partner anymore.

10:19.681 --> 10:21.048
So we don't have to do this.

10:21.170 --> 10:22.572
[Exhales sharply]

10:22.597 --> 10:23.732
[Footsteps approach]

10:23.757 --> 10:26.759
Hello, my two favorite
people on the planet.

10:28.012 --> 10:29.122
Before we start,

10:29.147 --> 10:31.081
does anyone happen to
bring any cashew milk?

10:33.098 --> 10:34.265
No?

10:34.299 --> 10:36.257
[Scoffs] Moving on, then.

10:47.445 --> 10:49.228
You want to talk about it?

10:49.447 --> 10:51.059
Talk about what?

10:51.570 --> 10:54.418
Whatever happened to you for
your face to look like that.

10:55.981 --> 10:58.949
I'm sorry, honey. My mind
is all over the place.

10:58.974 --> 11:00.741
You miss Daniel, don't you?

11:01.959 --> 11:03.426
[Sighs] Sorry.

11:03.460 --> 11:05.094
Never mind. May I be excused?

11:05.129 --> 11:06.762
Actually, uh, w-wait a second.

11:06.797 --> 11:09.265
Uh, I've been meaning to talk to you

11:09.300 --> 11:11.434
about that Tahoe trip I said no to.

11:11.468 --> 11:13.436
Are all of your friends
still going tomorrow?

11:13.470 --> 11:14.603
Yes.

11:14.638 --> 11:16.978
Are you trying to make me
feel worse about my life?

11:17.024 --> 11:18.574
Do you still want to go?

11:19.326 --> 11:20.576
Is that a trick question?

11:20.610 --> 11:21.936
Well, I've been thinking about it,

11:21.961 --> 11:25.089
and you've worked really
hard this semester,

11:25.114 --> 11:27.483
and I've been socking
away a few extra dollars.

11:27.517 --> 11:28.818
So if you still want to go...

11:28.852 --> 11:30.152
- I want to go.
- [Chuckles]

11:30.186 --> 11:32.447
Good, because I already
called your teacher,

11:32.472 --> 11:34.871
and she has an extra room for you. [Laughs]

11:34.896 --> 11:36.801
You'll have to share with
three other girls, but...

11:36.826 --> 11:37.960
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

11:37.994 --> 11:40.695
Thank you so much. You're so awesome.

11:44.658 --> 11:46.554
I hope the food here is okay.

11:47.536 --> 11:50.171
I've never been. But have you?

11:50.205 --> 11:54.843
Uh, no, I haven't, but I heard good things.

11:54.877 --> 11:56.243
Me too.

11:56.278 --> 11:58.236
Not from anyone I actually know.

11:58.614 --> 12:00.314
But Yelp liked it.

12:00.349 --> 12:02.484
What did we do before Yelp, huh?

12:03.357 --> 12:05.487
- Yeah, right?
- [Chuckling] Yeah.

12:09.269 --> 12:11.658
Um, so, the other day,

12:11.693 --> 12:13.927
you mentioned something about a-a new job?

12:13.962 --> 12:15.357
Oh. Right.

12:15.964 --> 12:19.100
<i>Yeah, it's not, like, a-a job job.</i>

12:19.134 --> 12:21.102
But do you remember how psyched I got

12:21.136 --> 12:23.108
- when I got that Ducation eBay?
- Mm-hmm.

12:23.132 --> 12:26.257
So I started restoring
these old bikes, and...

12:27.642 --> 12:30.588
Anyway, it's... It's a long, boring story.

12:30.613 --> 12:32.235
No, it sounds interesting to me.

12:32.950 --> 12:35.482
I'd rather hear about your work.

12:35.517 --> 12:38.993
Must be... Exciting being a lawyer.

12:39.930 --> 12:42.031
What made you want to do that?

12:42.675 --> 12:46.126
Oh, I-I was completely
obsessed with "L.A. law."

12:46.600 --> 12:48.697
So you only practice in L.A.?

12:48.722 --> 12:51.840
No, no, no, "L.A. law" was a-a TV show.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.408
Oh.

12:53.867 --> 12:56.144
I don't really watch a lot of TV.

12:56.169 --> 12:58.639
It's okay. I don't either, really.

13:02.576 --> 13:04.376
[Indistinct talking over P.A.]

13:04.411 --> 13:05.745
Just so you know,

13:05.779 --> 13:07.580
I'm not very good with blood tests.

13:07.614 --> 13:09.092
I usually faint.

13:09.253 --> 13:11.511
In fact, is it possible for me to lie down?

13:11.536 --> 13:13.111
Let's do the questions first.

13:13.136 --> 13:14.353
Then we'll worry about the blood draw.

13:14.387 --> 13:15.854
In the past 12 months,

13:15.888 --> 13:17.189
have you had a blood transfusion?

13:17.223 --> 13:18.323
No.

13:18.358 --> 13:20.312
Have you gotten any tattoos?

13:20.337 --> 13:22.305
No. My friend did, but not me.

13:22.562 --> 13:24.863
Are you an intravenous-drug user?

13:24.897 --> 13:26.031
No.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.232
In the past 12 months,

13:27.267 --> 13:29.827
have you had unprotected
vaginal, anal, or oral sex?

13:30.603 --> 13:31.903
Yes.

13:31.938 --> 13:33.438
I-I mean, maybe.

13:33.472 --> 13:35.440
- Maybe?
- It's possible.

13:35.474 --> 13:37.442
One of the times, I was... very drunk,

13:37.476 --> 13:39.110
and I'm not sure if I used a condom.

13:39.144 --> 13:42.089
I think I did, but I'm not sure.

13:42.982 --> 13:44.115
In the past 12 months,

13:44.149 --> 13:46.384
have you had unprotected
vaginal, anal, or oral sex

13:46.418 --> 13:47.618
with men who have sex with men?

13:48.639 --> 13:50.121
I-I don't know.

13:50.155 --> 13:52.423
I mean, I don't know some
of the men I slept with.

13:53.032 --> 13:56.094
I mean... I don't know much about them.

13:56.128 --> 13:58.096
In the past 12 months,
have you had sexual contact

13:58.130 --> 13:59.597
with anyone who has H.I.V. or AIDS

13:59.631 --> 14:02.633
or has had a positive test
for the H.I.V./AIDS virus?

14:04.836 --> 14:07.972
You know what? I don't feel very well.

14:08.006 --> 14:10.126
- Do you want some water?
- I have to go.

14:11.353 --> 14:12.375
Are you sure?

14:12.410 --> 14:14.022
I have to go now.

14:29.188 --> 14:31.189
[Knock on door]

14:33.192 --> 14:34.860

14:43.970 --> 14:45.044
Is Lucy... ?

14:45.069 --> 14:46.770
[Sighs] Lucy's in Tahoe for the week.

14:46.795 --> 14:47.962
[Door closes]

14:48.574 --> 14:51.342
So, agent Gordon's
gonna be here in an hour,

14:51.367 --> 14:53.168
so are you cool if he just sets up camp?

14:53.193 --> 14:54.660
Yep. He can set up wherever he wants.

14:54.685 --> 14:55.698
I don't care.

14:55.723 --> 14:56.923
Okay.

14:56.948 --> 14:58.586
I was kind of hoping we
could talk before he...

14:58.611 --> 15:00.585
There is nothing for us
to talk about, Daniel.

15:00.610 --> 15:02.311
I just want this whole thing over.

15:02.888 --> 15:04.656
I understand.

15:05.756 --> 15:07.389
No, you don't.

15:07.715 --> 15:09.183
You will never understand what you did

15:09.208 --> 15:10.342
or how badly you hurt me,

15:10.367 --> 15:12.034
so just stop acting like you do.

15:12.059 --> 15:13.393
Stop pretending like

15:13.418 --> 15:14.653
I meant as much to you as you did to me

15:14.678 --> 15:15.978
because it's only making it worse.

15:16.003 --> 15:17.076
[Scoffs]

15:20.072 --> 15:21.275
[Sighs]

15:21.300 --> 15:25.203
So, uh, where are they sending Paul?

15:25.228 --> 15:27.091
- You mean... ?
- When this is all over,

15:27.116 --> 15:28.282
will he be on the west coast?

15:28.307 --> 15:29.874
I just want to know if
I'll be able to find out

15:29.899 --> 15:30.899
for Lucy's sake.

15:32.734 --> 15:33.901
[Sighs]

15:35.956 --> 15:37.256
[Chuckles]

15:37.448 --> 15:39.282
You're not sending him anywhere, are you?

15:41.276 --> 15:44.083
[Sighs] Damn.

15:44.119 --> 15:47.314
Man, you guys are... damn!

15:47.339 --> 15:49.093
You know we gave him the opportunity

15:49.118 --> 15:50.462
to do the right thing months ago,

15:50.801 --> 15:52.405
and he didn't take it?

15:53.418 --> 15:54.718
Oh, instead, he ran.

15:54.972 --> 15:56.606
And he made the wrong choice again,

15:56.640 --> 15:58.845
which is why you find yourself
in this situation right now.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.901
He was scared. I'd
probably do the same thing.

16:00.926 --> 16:02.945
No, you wouldn't. You would
never have been in this situation

16:02.970 --> 16:04.037
because you are nothing like him.

16:04.062 --> 16:05.330
I didn't mean...

16:05.355 --> 16:06.689
You know what? It doesn't matter, okay?

16:06.714 --> 16:09.294
The FBI is not gonna make
protecting Paul a priority.

16:10.385 --> 16:12.520
Look, all we're trying
to do is catch a bad guy.

16:13.023 --> 16:15.457
<i>What if you're the bad guy?</i>

16:20.199 --> 16:21.296
Oh.

16:21.331 --> 16:22.400
[Gasps] Oh, my goodness.

16:22.425 --> 16:25.334
How much do you love this salad bowl?

16:25.368 --> 16:27.487
Oh, more than I love salad.

16:27.512 --> 16:29.313
[Both laugh] [Beep]

16:29.549 --> 16:32.137
This is seriously the
funniest thing ever. [Laughs]

16:32.162 --> 16:34.964
Hey, I'm so sorry again for
canceling on you last night.

16:34.989 --> 16:36.456
I didn't think I was
gonna be working that late.

16:36.481 --> 16:38.949
No, no, never apologize
for having a career.

16:38.974 --> 16:40.941
Once you start that, you'll never stop.

16:41.098 --> 16:43.065
Oh. I'll remember that.

16:43.090 --> 16:44.823
I don't even know why
we were there that late.

16:44.848 --> 16:46.883
I think it was so Greta could
make googly eyes at Harry.

16:46.908 --> 16:48.042
Who's Harry?

16:48.067 --> 16:49.534
He's, uh, my former
brother-in-law

16:49.559 --> 16:51.192
and the new chef at Wunderbar.

16:51.217 --> 16:53.352
Ooh. That's a funny coincidence.

16:53.377 --> 16:54.608
No, it's not.

16:54.633 --> 16:57.268
I got him the job, which I'm regretting

16:57.293 --> 16:59.152
now that he's being a
royal pain in the ass.

16:59.177 --> 17:01.644
Hmm. And he's sleeping with Greta,

17:01.669 --> 17:03.254
which is a bad idea, right?

17:03.279 --> 17:05.638
Ohh, these coffee mugs are cute.

17:05.664 --> 17:07.007
[Beep] And then I tried to talk to him,

17:07.041 --> 17:08.765
and he got all weird and defensive and s...

17:08.790 --> 17:11.267
I mean, it's not like I was
gonna judge him, obviously.

17:11.349 --> 17:13.989
That's the thing about Harry. He
goes into this really private place.

17:14.013 --> 17:15.656
It's so male, right?

17:15.911 --> 17:17.845
Oh, I don't know. [Chuckles]

17:17.917 --> 17:19.819
My Scottie isn't like that, is he?

17:19.844 --> 17:21.479
Scott? Oh, God, no.

17:21.503 --> 17:23.277
He doesn't have a private bone in his body.

17:23.301 --> 17:25.236
He's all squishy and open.

17:25.261 --> 17:26.428
[Both chuckle]

17:26.453 --> 17:28.088
Harry, on the other hand, he's a brooder.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.880
It must be an Australian thing.

17:29.905 --> 17:31.917
He's got a real dark side. It's... [Sighs]

17:31.942 --> 17:35.011
Is there something I need
to worry about here, Joss?

17:35.036 --> 17:36.137
Hmm?

17:36.162 --> 17:38.819
For a woman who's about to marry my son,

17:38.881 --> 17:41.548
you're talking an awful
lot about another man.

17:42.084 --> 17:44.085
And you might be too young to realize this,

17:44.110 --> 17:46.957
but that's unseemly.

17:47.763 --> 17:49.219
I'm sorry.

17:49.717 --> 17:51.143
You should be.

17:53.713 --> 17:57.048

18:09.061 --> 18:12.635
I was just calling to thank
you for such a... a nice night.

18:12.660 --> 18:14.054
Uh, yeah. It was fun.

18:14.079 --> 18:15.924
I thought maybe we could
do it again sometime.

18:16.048 --> 18:18.779
Uh, you know, I just got
put on a pretty big case.

18:18.837 --> 18:21.485
Um, and I'm pretty sure
it's gonna take up...

18:21.699 --> 18:24.247
A lot of my time in the coming weeks. So...

18:24.419 --> 18:27.411
Oh, man. I am such an idiot.

18:27.446 --> 18:30.247
What? No, you're not, Zack.

18:30.281 --> 18:32.464
I never should have picked that restaurant.

18:32.951 --> 18:35.252
It... That wasn't even my jacket.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.750
I-I had to borrow that from my brother.

18:37.775 --> 18:40.744
Uh, the jacket had nothing to do with it.

18:41.525 --> 18:42.640
I just...

18:42.665 --> 18:44.632
I don't think I'm ready to date yet.

18:44.722 --> 18:46.255
Well, you might be

18:46.280 --> 18:48.376
if I hadn't acted like such a stiff.

18:48.950 --> 18:50.251
I don't know what happened,

18:50.434 --> 18:53.403
but last night... that wasn't me.

18:53.437 --> 18:55.405
Yeah, it didn't seem like you.

I just wanted to make you comfortable, but

18:58.913 --> 19:01.444
<i>instead, I made us both uncomfortable.</i>

19:01.469 --> 19:04.436
Zack, the whole reason I
decided to go out with you was

19:04.461 --> 19:06.178
because I-I really like you.

19:06.203 --> 19:07.749
Well, all right, then.

19:07.818 --> 19:10.657
Give me one more shot. Tonight.

19:10.821 --> 19:13.553

but I can meet you there after.

when she was 6 years old.

to know him, but he...

23:23.289 --> 23:25.424

23:28.969 --> 23:31.270

Joss is about family, right?

It's everything to her,
probably because she never...

23:47.020 --> 23:49.288

23:49.322 --> 23:51.156
