WEBVTT

00:02.017 --> 00:05.321
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:06.156 --> 00:08.157
Hey, what're you doing there, Norm?

00:08.157 --> 00:10.160
Oh, Vera signed me up to give a speech

00:10.160 --> 00:11.661
at her Women's Auxiliary Club.

00:11.661 --> 00:12.662
(laughs)

00:12.662 --> 00:14.164
I hate public speaking.

00:14.164 --> 00:15.665
Yeah, you're not alone there, pal.

00:15.665 --> 00:17.167
Well, it's awful, you know.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.168
You're standing there

00:18.168 --> 00:20.170
in front of a group
of total strangers...

00:20.170 --> 00:22.672
palms sweating, your throat dry,

00:22.672 --> 00:24.674
your mouth feels like
it's full of cotton.

00:24.674 --> 00:26.042
your knees practically buckling.

00:26.042 --> 00:28.011
It can be a miserable
experience. I tell you.

00:28.011 --> 00:29.012
So what's the topic?

00:29.012 --> 00:32.015
"Poise: The Key to Success."

00:34.017 --> 00:37.437
(piano plays)

00:37.887 --> 00:40.190
? Making your way in the world today ?

00:40.190 --> 00:42.692
? Takes everything you've got ?

00:42.692 --> 00:46.196
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

00:46.196 --> 00:48.698
? Sure would help a lot ?

00:48.698 --> 00:51.701
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

00:54.454 --> 00:57.240
? Sometimes you want to go ?

00:57.240 --> 01:01.745
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:01.745 --> 01:07.250
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:07.250 --> 01:09.252
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:09.252 --> 01:12.255
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:12.255 --> 01:16.760
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:17.761 --> 01:20.263
? You want to go where people know ?

01:20.263 --> 01:22.766
? People are all the same ?

01:22.766 --> 01:27.270
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

01:44.337 --> 01:46.172
Thanks, Mom. Yeah, don't worry about it.

01:46.673 --> 01:48.174
I'll find somebody to sit for the kids.

01:48.174 --> 01:49.042
Bye.

01:49.042 --> 01:50.426
She can't do it?

01:50.927 --> 01:51.795
She's scared to.

01:53.179 --> 01:55.098
Oh, yeah, I'll, uh, watch
the kids for you, Carla.

01:55.098 --> 01:57.600
It's not fair. This always happens to me

01:57.600 --> 01:59.102
when I have a date on a weeknight.

01:59.102 --> 02:00.603
Oh, who's the lucky guy?

02:00.603 --> 02:01.471
My butcher.

02:01.471 --> 02:02.939
Oh, yeah? What happened to Eddie?

02:02.939 --> 02:04.357
Eddie's in Vancouver.

02:04.357 --> 02:06.359
My butcher's three blocks down.

02:06.359 --> 02:07.610
Life is short.

02:08.945 --> 02:11.231
I wouldn't mind, uh, looking
after your kids for you, Carla.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.116
What am I gonna do now?

02:14.617 --> 02:16.236
Well, I'd do it, but
I'm working on Wednesday.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.070
Yeah.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.571
Yeah, Vera and I would love to,

02:18.571 --> 02:20.073
but, uh, we have this
thing Wednesday night.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.374
Yeah, uh, Diane and I

02:21.374 --> 02:23.543
have a thing, too. Yeah.

02:23.543 --> 02:24.911
Maybe it's the same thing.

02:24.911 --> 02:26.796
I don't think so. Probably not.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.584
CLIFF: Oh, I'm, uh,
I'm not busy Wednesday.

02:31.584 --> 02:34.087
Well, guess I'm gonna
have to cancel my date.

02:36.589 --> 02:40.093
Well, is this a day to press
in your memory books or what?

02:40.093 --> 02:42.846
Well, you guys sound pretty chipper.

02:42.846 --> 02:44.147
Shall I tell them, Lilith?

02:44.147 --> 02:46.649
Out with it, or I'm liable
to burst with anticipation.

02:46.649 --> 02:47.517
(laughs)

02:49.235 --> 02:52.488
Doctors Sternin and Crane
are proud to announce

02:52.488 --> 02:55.358
that they are now officially POSSLQ's.

02:55.358 --> 02:57.193
(Frasier chuckles)

02:57.193 --> 03:00.663
It means "Persons of the Opposite
Sex Sharing Living Quarters."

03:00.663 --> 03:01.531
Yes.

03:01.531 --> 03:03.499
Oh.

03:03.499 --> 03:06.002
You see, it's a little, uh,
lovers' in-joke we picked up

03:06.002 --> 03:07.370
from a Census Bureau acronym.

03:07.370 --> 03:09.205
Oh, I love those.

03:11.207 --> 03:12.709
Well, man, hey, that's great.

03:12.709 --> 03:14.711
Congratulations. Yes, yes.

03:14.711 --> 03:15.712
Thank you.

03:15.712 --> 03:17.680
But this is... quite a surprise.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.432
You've only known each
other a few months,

03:19.432 --> 03:21.217
and you're moving in together?

03:21.217 --> 03:23.469
That's pretty impetuous.

03:23.469 --> 03:26.389
Well, a week ago, we decided to
take a chance on cohabitation,

03:26.389 --> 03:28.892
but we waited a week
before announcing the news,

03:28.892 --> 03:29.893
so as to avoid

03:29.893 --> 03:31.311
putting any undue pressure

03:31.311 --> 03:33.196
on the success or
failure of the endeavor.

03:33.196 --> 03:35.982
And now we are pleased
to announce the effort

03:35.982 --> 03:37.367
a limited success.

03:39.152 --> 03:43.539
Yes, pretty darn impetuous.

03:43.539 --> 03:45.408
Well, we thought that the two of you

03:45.408 --> 03:46.910
were responsible for Lilith and I

03:46.910 --> 03:49.412
finding each other in
this cockeyed world,

03:49.412 --> 03:51.414
so, we, uh, we thought
we'd like to have you

03:51.414 --> 03:54.417
over for dinner on Wednesday
night as our very first guests.

03:54.417 --> 03:55.919
Aw. Why, we'd be honored.

03:55.919 --> 03:57.420
Yeah, I'll be there.

03:57.420 --> 03:58.388
Great. We'll get away

03:58.388 --> 03:59.889
from the hurly-burly of this place

03:59.889 --> 04:01.758
and concentrate completely on
the lost art of conversation.

04:01.758 --> 04:03.593
Hmm. I'll be there anyway.

04:04.894 --> 04:05.895
All right,

04:05.895 --> 04:07.897
Wednesday night it is
then. Oh, uh, shall we say,

04:07.897 --> 04:09.399
oh, uh, what...

04:09.399 --> 04:10.266
8:00-ish?

04:10.266 --> 04:11.651
Wonderful.

04:11.651 --> 04:14.654
You don't know how happy this makes me.

04:17.023 --> 04:19.442
So, you and Diane have this
thing Wednesday night, huh?

04:19.442 --> 04:21.327
Well, why don't you
just come out and say it?

04:21.327 --> 04:24.113
You don't want to spend an
evening alone with my kids.

04:24.113 --> 04:27.917
BOTH: We don't want to spend
an evening alone with your kids.

04:27.917 --> 04:30.787
Neither do I.

04:30.787 --> 04:32.789
But what choice do I have?

04:32.789 --> 04:33.756
Well... Carla,

04:33.756 --> 04:37.627
I think Cliff might be
interested in watching them.

04:37.627 --> 04:39.095
Hey, hey,

04:39.095 --> 04:40.596
what are you doing Wednesday night?

04:40.596 --> 04:42.098
Pumping iron.

04:46.602 --> 04:48.604
Okay, Cliff, you're up.

04:49.105 --> 04:51.107
Be at my house Wednesday at 6:00.

04:51.107 --> 04:53.109
But remember, you asked for it.

04:53.109 --> 04:54.610
(chuckles)

04:54.610 --> 04:55.611
Here, come here. Here...

04:55.611 --> 04:58.614
obviously, she doesn't think
that I can handle the kids, huh?

04:58.614 --> 05:01.617
Yeah, but my guess is that,
uh, they'll settle down once

05:01.617 --> 05:04.120
they're confronted with a
strong male authority figure.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.622
Are you bringing your mom?

05:27.510 --> 05:29.512
I'm home, sweet potato.

05:31.514 --> 05:33.733
Just a moment, cinnamon bear.

05:54.537 --> 05:56.539
How was your day?

05:56.539 --> 05:59.042
Oh, I want to take you now, by the dip.

05:59.042 --> 06:01.044
You impulsive man.
We have guests coming.

06:01.044 --> 06:02.045
Yes, I know.

06:02.045 --> 06:03.546
It'll be our little joke on them.

06:03.546 --> 06:05.048
Every time they say the word "dip,"

06:05.548 --> 06:07.050
we'll become giddy with remembrance.

06:08.551 --> 06:10.553
The word itself will
become a syllable filled

06:10.553 --> 06:12.555
with our overwhelming passion.

06:12.555 --> 06:15.558
Dear, you're using sex
to express your aggression

06:15.558 --> 06:18.561
toward the confines of polite society.

06:18.561 --> 06:19.562
Dip.

06:19.562 --> 06:20.446
I love that.

06:25.368 --> 06:28.287
What is that heavenly aroma
coming from the kitchen?

06:28.287 --> 06:29.288
Dinner.

06:29.288 --> 06:31.290
Oh, yes, of course, dinner.

06:31.290 --> 06:33.292
Well, I'm sorry I'm
late, by the way. I got...

06:33.292 --> 06:34.794
No explanation is necessary.

06:34.794 --> 06:36.796
I know you far too well
to have expected you

06:36.796 --> 06:37.797
to be on time tonight.

06:37.797 --> 06:38.798
Oh, right.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.917
Why is that?

06:40.917 --> 06:42.218
Because I've learned that

06:42.218 --> 06:43.719
a certain self-centered insensitivity

06:43.719 --> 06:46.222
is a fundamental part of
your psychological makeup.

06:46.222 --> 06:48.224
And it only endears you to me.

06:50.226 --> 06:52.228
I'm so glad you shared that with me.

06:53.729 --> 06:56.732
Of course you can't
know everything about me.

06:56.732 --> 06:58.734
I mean, who would have thought
that I'd enjoy living with you,

06:58.734 --> 07:00.736
but here we are.

07:00.736 --> 07:02.738
You didn't expect to
enjoy living with me?

07:02.738 --> 07:04.740
Well, you do have a...

07:04.740 --> 07:06.242
uncompromising quality.

07:06.242 --> 07:07.243
Mm.

07:07.743 --> 07:09.745
A very attractive one it is, though.

07:09.745 --> 07:11.747
Well, if you were hesitant, why do it?

07:11.747 --> 07:14.250
That's the way you
arranged it, isn't it?

07:14.250 --> 07:15.751
It was your idea.

07:15.751 --> 07:17.003
Ah, yes, well,

07:17.003 --> 07:18.287
you see, you're forgetting the, uh,

07:18.287 --> 07:20.790
passive-aggressive trick you
have of leading someone else

07:20.790 --> 07:22.291
into doing something
that you want to do,

07:22.291 --> 07:23.543
thereby absolving yourself

07:23.543 --> 07:24.844
of responsibility.

07:25.344 --> 07:27.847
And very adorable it is,
too, my little parsnip.

07:31.350 --> 07:34.854
Why do you insist on
displaying your magazines

07:34.854 --> 07:37.106
in that insipid accordion design?

07:41.861 --> 07:44.363
I'm sorry if this one little
touch of theatrical flair

07:44.363 --> 07:46.365
is too much for your retentive nature.

07:47.733 --> 07:50.236
We'll go into my retentive nature later.

07:50.236 --> 07:51.621
For now, we have guests coming.

07:51.621 --> 07:53.122
You know, I see what
you're trying to do here.

07:53.122 --> 07:54.624
You want me to begin the
argument that you wish

07:54.624 --> 07:56.125
you could start yourself.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.126
Well, I will not do it.

07:57.126 --> 07:59.629
If you want to have an
altercation, you will have to...

07:59.629 --> 08:01.497
How could you be late
on a night like this?!

08:01.497 --> 08:03.966
Didn't you know I'd be
nervous making my first dinner

08:03.966 --> 08:06.469
in your house while your
stupid friends are looking at me

08:06.469 --> 08:07.720
and judging my every move?

08:07.720 --> 08:10.056
I'll never forgive you for this!

08:10.056 --> 08:12.308
Never, never, never, never!

08:12.308 --> 08:15.011
(doorbell chimes)

08:17.897 --> 08:19.815
Just a minute!

08:19.815 --> 08:22.318
Darling, I think that
was a real breakthrough.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.822
So come out of the
bathroom, and after dinner,

08:26.822 --> 08:28.324
we'll build on it.

08:28.324 --> 08:30.826
But, our-our guests are here now.

08:30.826 --> 08:31.827
Dear heart?

08:31.827 --> 08:32.828
(doorbell chimes)

08:32.828 --> 08:34.330
Darling.

08:34.330 --> 08:37.332
Coming! Coming!

08:42.538 --> 08:45.041
Hi! Come in, come in!

08:45.041 --> 08:46.042
I hope we're not early.

08:46.042 --> 08:48.544
Oh, no, no, no, your
timing is just perfect.

08:48.544 --> 08:49.545
Oh.

08:49.545 --> 08:51.514
Boy, am I hungry.

08:51.514 --> 08:52.515
Sam.

08:52.515 --> 08:53.516
Well, I am.

08:53.516 --> 08:56.519
So, where's your lovely POSSLQ?

08:56.519 --> 08:59.021
Oh, she's around somewhere.

08:59.021 --> 09:00.473
Peach blossom?

09:01.974 --> 09:03.476
Don't make yourself too beautiful.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.478
I can hardly stand to look at you now.

09:09.482 --> 09:12.485
(softly): Come on...
please come out, darling.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.986
Please.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.488
(louder): What was that?

09:15.488 --> 09:16.989
Oh, uh...

09:16.989 --> 09:18.874
got something stuck in her contact lens.

09:18.874 --> 09:20.293
Oh, I hate that. Yeah.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.161
Li-Listen, here, come sit down, relax.

09:22.161 --> 09:23.963
Uh, pour yourself some wine, whatever.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.965
Just, uh, make yourselves comfortable.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.217
Oh, oh, Diane, could you hand
me that cheese knife, please?

09:31.003 --> 09:32.004
Thank you.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.507
Uh, enjoy. I'll be right back.

09:35.391 --> 09:37.343
(lock rattling)

09:42.848 --> 09:46.852
FRASIER: What do you
think you're doing?!

09:46.852 --> 09:48.988
LILITH: Might I have a little privacy?

09:48.988 --> 09:50.273
FRASIER: We can resolve all this later,

09:50.273 --> 09:52.775
but for now, these people may
be my friends, but they are not

09:52.775 --> 09:54.777
the greatest
conversationalists in the world,

09:54.777 --> 09:56.112
and I could use your help.

09:59.415 --> 10:01.417
Good chips.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.539
Lilith. Ah.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.791
Welcome to our home.

10:12.128 --> 10:15.014
I am so happy for the both of you.

10:15.014 --> 10:16.349
Yeah, absolutely. Congratulations.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.850
Yeah, that's great.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.724
(loud crunch)

10:28.060 --> 10:30.062
Love what you've done
with this place, man.

10:30.062 --> 10:31.314
DIANE: Oh, yes, I love

10:31.314 --> 10:33.115
the masculine touches.

10:33.115 --> 10:35.284
Thank you.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.409
Say, that, uh, that dip looks good.

10:43.409 --> 10:44.710
DIANE: Mmm.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.798
Dip?

10:48.798 --> 10:50.633
Yeah, the, uh, the dip.

10:50.633 --> 10:52.134
Could you, uh, pass it, please?

10:52.134 --> 10:54.503
(chuckling): Yes, of course.

10:54.503 --> 10:56.756
Be my guest. Here you are.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.257
Oh, thank you.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.678
Oh...

11:02.678 --> 11:04.397
Oh, yeah, that is great dip.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.815
Mmm, here. Yeah, try it.

11:05.815 --> 11:07.683
DIANE: Mmm, delicious, Lilith.

11:07.683 --> 11:10.069
Frasier, have you tried
some of Lilith's dip?

11:14.857 --> 11:17.360
Yes, I-I have, yes.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.416
Well, then I don't have
to tell you how good it is.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.784
DIANE: Mmm.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.285
It's quite good.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.171
Well, I don't mean to hog it here.

11:29.171 --> 11:30.673
Uh, you guys look hungry.

11:30.673 --> 11:31.674
He-Help yourself.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.441
So, Frasier,

11:48.441 --> 11:51.110
was it good for you, too?

11:58.234 --> 12:00.236
What the hell's in this dip?

12:04.740 --> 12:07.743
Well...

12:07.743 --> 12:10.246
may I propose a toast?

12:10.246 --> 12:11.747
Mmm!

12:11.747 --> 12:13.749
To your house.

12:13.749 --> 12:14.750
Our house.

12:14.750 --> 12:15.634
Hear, hear.

12:15.634 --> 12:17.086
Yes. (Frasier laughs)

12:17.086 --> 12:19.088
(playing piano) ? Our house ?

12:19.088 --> 12:20.589
Oh, I love that.

12:20.589 --> 12:23.092
? Is a very, very, very fine house ?

12:23.092 --> 12:25.094
? With two cats in the yard ?

12:25.094 --> 12:28.097
? Life used to be so hard ?

12:28.097 --> 12:33.486
? Now everything is easy 'cause of you ?

12:33.486 --> 12:35.771
? And our... ?

12:35.771 --> 12:37.773
? Our house ?

12:37.773 --> 12:40.776
(Diane singing along): ? Is a
very, very, very fine house ?

12:40.776 --> 12:43.446
? With two cats in the yard ?

12:43.446 --> 12:45.030
(singing alone): ? Life
used to be so hard ?

12:45.030 --> 12:47.199
? Now... ? Et cetera, et cetera.

12:51.454 --> 12:54.340
You know what I love
about your relationship?

12:54.340 --> 12:56.342
No.

12:57.343 --> 13:02.348
You never seem to have
an unexpressed thought.

13:02.348 --> 13:03.716
I've noticed that.

13:05.100 --> 13:08.771
How do you maintain
that level of honesty?

13:08.771 --> 13:10.139
Well, it's simple.

13:10.139 --> 13:13.025
Frasier and I keep no
secrets from each other.

13:13.025 --> 13:14.193
Oh, come on.

13:14.193 --> 13:14.977
You don't mean to tell me

13:15.478 --> 13:16.479
you tell each other everything.

13:16.479 --> 13:17.480
Certainly. Exactly.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.865
We've bared our souls to each other.

13:19.865 --> 13:22.201
Oh, now no guy's going to
tell his brand-new girlfriend

13:22.201 --> 13:23.202
about all the women he...

13:23.202 --> 13:26.455
You know.

13:26.455 --> 13:28.741
Oh, but there must be
no secrets in that area.

13:28.741 --> 13:31.243
That's where honesty counts most.

13:31.744 --> 13:32.745
Gee, you know, I-I'm afraid

13:32.745 --> 13:34.246
I don't think that's such a good idea.

13:34.246 --> 13:36.665
You mean the two of
you, planning marriage,

13:36.665 --> 13:38.667
haven't already had this discussion?

13:38.667 --> 13:39.668
Of course we have.

13:40.169 --> 13:41.170
Well, Diane's told
us about both of hers,

13:41.670 --> 13:44.173
and we're just about up to the
Johnson Administration on mine.

13:47.643 --> 13:49.979
Uh, seriously, though, um,

13:49.979 --> 13:54.984
I-I think that we're all
entitled to our little secrets.

13:54.984 --> 13:55.985
Why?

13:55.985 --> 13:57.486
They only lead to embarrassment

13:57.486 --> 13:59.488
when they're inevitably revealed.

13:59.488 --> 14:00.856
Exactly.

14:00.856 --> 14:02.358
I know I feel better

14:02.358 --> 14:04.360
knowing that Frasier has told you

14:04.360 --> 14:05.744
he and I were once engaged,

14:05.744 --> 14:07.079
so I don't have to worry

14:07.079 --> 14:11.500
about you discovering it
at some inopportune moment.

14:19.208 --> 14:21.710
Like now, for instance.

14:29.101 --> 14:31.387
Dear...

14:31.387 --> 14:34.390
dear, I thought I told you
that Diane and I used to date.

14:34.390 --> 14:35.891
LILITH: Date, yes.

14:35.891 --> 14:37.393
That you had decided to marry

14:37.393 --> 14:39.395
and spend the rest of
your life with her, no.

14:39.395 --> 14:41.780
Semantics.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.033
And why were you afraid
to tell me that one detail?

14:44.033 --> 14:45.034
Because she still means

14:45.034 --> 14:46.535
something to you, doesn't she?

14:46.535 --> 14:48.037
She means absolutely nothing to me.

14:48.037 --> 14:50.539
I mean, if I notice her at all,
it's merely as an annoyance,

14:50.539 --> 14:52.908
like a bug flying around in a room.

14:52.908 --> 14:54.877
FRASIER: Diane, Diane, be a dear.

14:54.877 --> 14:57.379
Would you grab me the
cheese knife, please?

14:57.379 --> 14:59.665
Frasier,

14:59.665 --> 15:01.050
I'm sorry this happened,

15:01.050 --> 15:04.053
but I think it would
be best for everyone

15:04.053 --> 15:05.921
if you told her the truth.

15:05.921 --> 15:07.756
Diane's right.

15:15.014 --> 15:16.015
All right, all right.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.517
Darling, I'm going to tell you

15:18.517 --> 15:20.519
the whole truth.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.521
(latch rattling)

15:30.412 --> 15:33.916
Out with it.

15:33.916 --> 15:37.419
All right, uh,

15:37.419 --> 15:41.924
Diane and I were engaged
to be married and...

15:41.924 --> 15:44.426
she left me at the altar.

15:45.844 --> 15:49.765
The whole experience
was so... humiliating,

15:49.765 --> 15:53.769
I-I-I've just been trying
to forget it ever since.

15:53.769 --> 15:56.722
Your feelings for her were genuine?

15:57.189 --> 15:59.108
Yes.

15:59.108 --> 16:01.360
And it's only on account of her action

16:01.360 --> 16:03.362
that you're not married to her

16:03.362 --> 16:04.780
at this very moment?

16:04.780 --> 16:07.282
Well, I-I never really
looked at it that way.

16:07.282 --> 16:08.784
And if Sam were out of the picture,

16:08.784 --> 16:10.285
you'd throw me over and run
back to her, wouldn't you?

16:10.285 --> 16:11.286
I don't love her anymore.

16:11.286 --> 16:12.287
You switch your passions

16:12.287 --> 16:13.789
on and off very quickly, Dr. Crane.

16:13.789 --> 16:14.289
I do not!

16:14.289 --> 16:15.791
Then you do still love her!

16:15.791 --> 16:16.659
Well, I never did!

16:16.659 --> 16:17.960
You were going to marry her!

16:17.960 --> 16:19.461
Well, maybe I just thought I loved her!

16:19.461 --> 16:21.463
How do I know you don't
just think you love me?

16:21.463 --> 16:22.464
Well, I don't.

16:22.965 --> 16:23.966
I mean, I-I
didn't... I-I never...

16:23.966 --> 16:27.469
I will not be grilled
like a common criminal!

16:32.508 --> 16:36.512
Cheese knife?

16:41.016 --> 16:45.020
All right, thank you very much. Bye.

16:45.020 --> 16:47.022
Ordering another round for
the corner table, honey.

16:47.022 --> 16:48.524
All right, Corinne.

16:48.524 --> 16:50.909
Now listen, uh, thanks a lot
for subbin' on such short notice.

16:50.909 --> 16:52.661
Hey, this is my life.

16:53.662 --> 16:55.664
It shouldn't, uh, it
shouldn't be so bad.

16:55.664 --> 16:57.666
You know, it's not really
very crowded tonight.

16:57.666 --> 16:59.168
That's what you said the last time.

16:59.168 --> 17:00.669
When I got home,

17:00.669 --> 17:03.172
my can was dragging
this far off the ground.

17:04.173 --> 17:08.676
Thanks for sharing
that with us, Corinne.

17:10.546 --> 17:11.964
Well, that was Carla's daughter.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.464
She said that, uh, the kids

17:13.464 --> 17:15.467
are going to drop off Mr. Clavin.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.970
All right. All right.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.973
I don't think her kids
are old enough to drive.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.473
(tires screeching)

17:22.974 --> 17:24.476
What was that?

17:24.476 --> 17:25.894
(pained grunting)

17:25.894 --> 17:29.314
(tires screeching, car speeding away)

17:29.314 --> 17:31.316
Cliff! Cliff!

17:31.316 --> 17:33.318
Cliff, Cliff buddy, are you all right?

17:33.318 --> 17:35.320
(Cliff mumbling)

17:39.324 --> 17:40.325
Wait, there's a note.

17:40.826 --> 17:41.827
(muffled shouting)

17:41.827 --> 17:43.829
"Don't open until Christmas."

17:43.829 --> 17:45.330
Aw, shoot.

17:45.831 --> 17:46.832
(muffled shouting)

17:50.169 --> 17:52.471
DIANE: Now look here,
Lilith, you needn't worry

17:52.471 --> 17:55.340
about Frasier carrying a torch for me.

17:55.340 --> 17:57.259
I assure you

17:57.259 --> 17:59.061
he feels nothing but
resentment toward me.

17:59.061 --> 18:01.063
He knows I was using him

18:01.063 --> 18:04.933
to forget the real
love I felt, and feel,

18:04.933 --> 18:06.268
for Sam here.

18:06.268 --> 18:09.271
Is there any more Chex Mix?

18:12.274 --> 18:14.777
You see, Sam is my real love.

18:15.944 --> 18:18.997
I'm ashamed to say that Frasier

18:18.997 --> 18:22.501
was a convenient dalliance on my part,

18:22.501 --> 18:24.920
at a time when I needed someone,

18:24.920 --> 18:25.921
anyone.

18:25.921 --> 18:27.923
I'm sorry it was him.

18:27.923 --> 18:30.926
So, essentially, Frasier was a toy

18:30.926 --> 18:34.429
you played with briefly
and then threw away.

18:34.429 --> 18:37.432
Well, it wasn't that bad.

18:37.432 --> 18:38.934
A fellow human being,

18:38.934 --> 18:41.937
whose emotions you twisted
for your own satisfaction,

18:41.937 --> 18:44.439
with no consideration for his feelings.

18:44.439 --> 18:46.942
Frasier had some fun.

18:46.942 --> 18:50.946
We would speak nothing
but French on Sundays.

18:57.452 --> 19:01.456
I heard it all.

19:01.456 --> 19:03.458
How could I have been so blind?

19:03.959 --> 19:05.961
Don't blame yourself.

19:05.961 --> 19:07.462
That's right.

19:07.462 --> 19:09.965
You can't blame anyone
in these situations.

19:09.965 --> 19:11.333
He can blame you.

19:13.836 --> 19:16.338
Now look here.

19:16.338 --> 19:19.842
Our relationship was a two-way street.

19:19.842 --> 19:21.844
Yes, and I was run
over in both directions.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.265
Oh, Frasier, you had fun.

19:26.265 --> 19:28.267
Diane, I never had a whit of fun,

19:28.267 --> 19:30.769
especially on Sundays.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.271
And the only thing more egregious

19:32.271 --> 19:34.273
than your French
pronunciation is your syntax.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.028
(door closes)

19:40.028 --> 19:41.496
(bell rings)

19:41.496 --> 19:42.998
Dinner, everyone. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:42.998 --> 19:44.249
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

19:44.249 --> 19:47.085
Come on, this whole thing
has gone on too far here.

19:47.085 --> 19:49.087
Hey, listen up.

19:49.087 --> 19:52.591
This is what happens
when you open old wounds.

19:52.591 --> 19:53.876
I mean, I don't know

19:53.876 --> 19:55.928
what happened between Frasier and Diane,

19:55.928 --> 19:57.930
but it seems to me
they had a little fun,

19:57.930 --> 20:00.299
but they just weren't
right for each other.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.217
But now that they've found somebody

20:02.217 --> 20:03.218
that, uh, is right for them,

20:03.218 --> 20:05.721
I-I think you both should
be happy for each other.

20:05.721 --> 20:07.723
And leave it at that.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.110
(door opens)

20:12.110 --> 20:15.113
Oh.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.619
Je regrette, mes amis.

20:20.619 --> 20:21.620
I'm sorry, too, Diane.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.121
I don't know what came over me.

20:23.121 --> 20:25.123
Diane, can you forgive me?

20:25.123 --> 20:27.626
Oh, I'm the one who's sorry.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.128
And happy for both of you.

20:30.128 --> 20:31.630
Thank you.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.131
And thank you, Sam.

20:33.131 --> 20:35.634
Yes. Mmm, well, I just
thought it went on long enough.

20:35.634 --> 20:38.003
Besides, I-I have to
use the bathroom here.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.395
Would anyone like some more lasagna?

20:46.395 --> 20:47.763
DIANE: No, thank you.

20:47.763 --> 20:49.064
I think we've had our fill.

20:49.064 --> 20:52.067
Fine, then I'll just get the coffee.

20:52.067 --> 20:55.938
Lasagna?

20:55.938 --> 20:58.323
I wasn't even thinking Italian.

20:58.323 --> 21:00.242
Well, I was closest.

21:00.242 --> 21:02.744
I said something with meat.

21:02.744 --> 21:04.246
LILITH: That will be all then, Jill.

21:04.246 --> 21:06.498
You can come by and
clean up in the morning.

21:06.498 --> 21:07.916
JILL: Thank you, Dr. Sternin.

21:08.917 --> 21:11.420
You mean you had someone back there

21:11.420 --> 21:12.921
helping you with this?

21:12.921 --> 21:14.423
With the side dishes, yes.

21:14.423 --> 21:16.925
But at the risk of sounding immodest,

21:16.925 --> 21:19.928
I have to take credit
for the lasagna myself.

21:19.928 --> 21:21.346
Oh, well.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.348
DIANE: Well, bravo.

21:25.350 --> 21:26.852
Well, shall we adjourn
to the living room

21:26.852 --> 21:27.853
for some coffee?

21:28.353 --> 21:29.354
DIANE: Nice.

21:29.354 --> 21:32.858
Oh, may I propose another toast?

21:32.858 --> 21:35.360
Why stop at seven? Hah.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.364
Well,

21:39.364 --> 21:42.868
we have all learned a
valuable lesson this evening.

21:42.868 --> 21:45.370
We shouldn't be frightened of the past,

21:45.370 --> 21:46.872
or of any affairs

21:46.872 --> 21:48.740
our lovers have had. Indeed,

21:49.157 --> 21:52.160
we should be grateful
for those past experiences

21:52.160 --> 21:54.162
because they've made him or her

21:54.162 --> 21:55.664
the person we love today.

21:55.664 --> 21:57.666
Hear, hear.

21:57.666 --> 21:58.667
Well said.

21:58.667 --> 22:01.169
Oh, hey, let me, uh, fill some
of these wine glasses here.

22:05.674 --> 22:07.059
Good night, Dr. Sternin.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.310
LILITH: Good night.

22:08.310 --> 22:10.812
Oh, Sam Malone!

22:10.812 --> 22:13.181
Oh, you beautiful man!

22:13.181 --> 22:15.517
JILL: Where have you
been keeping yourself?

22:15.517 --> 22:17.519
Hey, Jill, how the hell you been, huh?

22:18.020 --> 22:20.022
Great, just great.

22:20.022 --> 22:21.523
Well, you still doing massage?

22:21.523 --> 22:23.909
Just the way you like 'em.

22:23.909 --> 22:25.777
Who is this, Sam?

22:25.777 --> 22:27.746
Uh, you know, it's gettin' kinda late.

22:27.746 --> 22:29.247
Maybe you oughta take off.

22:29.247 --> 22:31.249
Bye-bye.

22:31.249 --> 22:32.751
Huh!

22:32.751 --> 22:35.754
Why is it

22:35.754 --> 22:40.258
that we cannot go to one,
single, solitary place

22:40.258 --> 22:42.761
in the entire city of Boston

22:42.761 --> 22:45.764
without running into some woman
that you've had a fling with?

22:45.764 --> 22:47.766
Oh, come on, you're exaggerating here.

22:47.766 --> 22:49.267
Mm-hmm. At the market, at the movies,

22:49.267 --> 22:54.272
when we got our blood
test, for heaven's sake.

22:54.272 --> 22:55.774
Well, what're we supposed to do, move?

22:55.774 --> 22:57.776
I mean, come on.

22:57.776 --> 22:59.144
Excuse me.

22:59.144 --> 23:03.115
Oh, now, don't, no, don't-don't go...

23:03.115 --> 23:04.983
What-what're you so upset about?

23:04.983 --> 23:07.486
I wasn't even dating you
when I went out with Jill.

23:07.986 --> 23:09.988
That's when you were
living with Frasier.

23:10.989 --> 23:13.291
She lived with you?

23:15.160 --> 23:18.046
Well, only briefly. Uh...

23:18.046 --> 23:20.799
You said you'd never
lived with anyone but me!

23:20.799 --> 23:23.802
Yeah, open... that's right.

23:27.305 --> 23:29.307
What are you doing?

23:29.307 --> 23:31.309
I should have thought of this earlier.

23:31.309 --> 23:33.812
(chuckling)

23:33.812 --> 23:35.814
Yeah. (chuckles)

23:35.814 --> 23:38.316
LILITH: What was that?

23:38.316 --> 23:40.318
Frasier, what are you doing?

23:40.318 --> 23:41.820
(door rattling)

23:41.820 --> 23:43.822
Frasier, the door seems to be jammed.

23:43.822 --> 23:45.323
(knocking on door) Frasier?

23:45.323 --> 23:47.826
DIANE: Sam, open the door.

23:47.826 --> 23:48.827
Macanudo?

23:48.827 --> 23:50.328
Oh!

23:50.328 --> 23:51.830
Frasier! Don't mind if I do.

23:51.830 --> 23:52.831
Thank you. Open the door.

23:53.331 --> 23:54.332
You know, I don't think I can stand

23:54.332 --> 23:55.333
this caterwauling in here.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.835
Why don't we go upstairs.
(knocking on door)

23:56.835 --> 23:59.704
I've got all 13 episodes
of I, Claudius on tape.

23:59.704 --> 24:02.007
Great. Man, I love gladiator flicks.

24:02.007 --> 24:04.376
(pounding on door)

24:04.376 --> 24:07.212
LILITH: Frasier, we are not amused!
