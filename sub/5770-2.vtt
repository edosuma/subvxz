[Mindy, narrating]
IF YOU LOOK HARD ENOUGH,

00:04.743 --> 00:08.051
YOU CAN SEE LOVE
EVERYWHERE.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.705
TAKE MY COMMUTE TO WORK.

00:09.748 --> 00:12.708
EVERY STAGE OF LIFE
AND ROMANCE IS ON DISPLAY--

00:12.751 --> 00:15.928
THE SHY GLANCES
OF NEW LOVE BLOSSOMING...

00:15.972 --> 00:18.714
THE PASSIONATE EMBRACES
OF YOUNG LOVERS...

00:18.757 --> 00:21.412
TWO OLD FOLKS WHO STILL SEEM
PRETTY INTO EACH OTHER.

00:21.456 --> 00:24.067
WOULD YOU PLEASE
STOP NARRATING?I CAN'T HELP IT, DANNY.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.242
I CAN'T HAVE
THESE BEAUTIFUL INSIGHTS

00:25.286 --> 00:26.635
AND NOT SHARE THEM
WITH SOMEONE.

00:26.678 --> 00:28.028
CAN YOU SHARE 'EM
WITH THE PEOPLE OVER THERE?

00:28.071 --> 00:29.072
THEY MIGHT WANT
TO HEAR 'EM.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.595
NO, I'M STANDING
NEXT TO YOU, DANNY.

00:30.639 --> 00:32.336
I CAN'T RUN INTO SOMEONE
I KNOW ON THE SUBWAY

00:32.380 --> 00:34.121
AND NOT STAND NEXT TO THEM--
IT'S WEIRD.

00:34.164 --> 00:36.079
IT'S NOT WE--
WHAT'S WEIRD ABOUT IT?

00:36.123 --> 00:38.473
WEIRD--WEIRD WOULD BE
IF THE TRAIN STOPPED,

00:38.516 --> 00:41.128
AND WHEN YOU GOT OFF,
IT WAS SUDDENLY THE 1940s.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.390
WHOA.
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

00:42.433 --> 00:44.087
LOOK, IT'S JUST
AN EXAMPLE.

00:44.131 --> 00:45.393
I'M NOT TRYING
TO TELL YOU A STORY.

00:45.436 --> 00:47.134
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THAT'S, LIKE, A GREAT--

00:47.177 --> 00:48.700
YOU'RE KIND OF
A NATURAL STORYTELLER.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.267
OKAY.
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

00:50.311 --> 00:53.227
OR THE BITTER DIVORCEE,
CLUTCHING HIS NEWSPAPER,

00:53.270 --> 00:55.838
STEWING OVER A LIFETIME
OF RAGE AND REGRET.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.927
BUT UNDER THAT GRISTLE
AND ICY EXTERIOR,

00:57.970 --> 00:59.059
DOES A WARM HEART BEAT?

00:59.102 --> 01:00.886
NO. ONLY TIME WILL TELL.

01:00.930 --> 01:01.887
NO, TIME WON'T.

01:01.931 --> 01:04.107
YES, TIME WILL.

01:04.151 --> 01:07.067
[upbeat dance music]

01:07.110 --> 01:15.075
â™ª

01:20.167 --> 01:21.211
MORNING, YOU GUYS.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.734
MORNING.

01:22.778 --> 01:23.822
I BROUGHT YOU
THE BOTTOM HALF

01:23.866 --> 01:25.128
OF MY, UH,
MOVIE-THEATER CANDY.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.564
OOH, YES.OOH.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.436
YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT
HAPPENED TO ME THIS WEEKEND.

01:28.479 --> 01:29.437
I MET A CUTE GUY
AT A BOOKSTORE.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.482
OH.

01:31.526 --> 01:34.137
[Mindy, narrating]
LIKE ANYONE WHO GOES
TO THE BOOKSTORE,

01:34.181 --> 01:35.704
I WASN'T THERE
TO BUY BOOKS.

01:35.747 --> 01:38.141
I DO THAT ON THE INTERNET
AT, LIKE, 50% OFF

01:38.185 --> 01:39.708
AND FREE SHIPPING
AND NO TAX.

01:39.751 --> 01:40.709
OH, MY GOD.

01:40.752 --> 01:43.494
$28.95 FOR A BOOK?

01:43.538 --> 01:46.149
BUT LUCKILY, THIS TIME,
I MADE AN EXCEPTION,

01:46.193 --> 01:49.021
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT I CAN NEVER RESIST,

01:49.065 --> 01:52.851
IT'S A GOOD TOTE BAG.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.160
HEY, ARE YOU
GONNA BUY THAT BOOK?

01:57.204 --> 01:58.683
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.772
I'M ONLY ASKING BECAUSE I HAVE
TWO BOOKS AND YOU HAVE ONE.

02:00.816 --> 02:04.124
SO, IF WE COMBINE THEM,
I COULD GET A TOTE BAG.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.822
BUT WHY WOULDN'T
I GET THE FREE TOTE BAG?

02:06.865 --> 02:08.650
'CAUSE YOU'RE A GUY.
WHAT DO YOU NEED A TOTE BAG FOR?

02:08.693 --> 02:10.869
I CAN STORE
ALL MY TOTE BAGS

02:10.913 --> 02:12.001
I DON'T USE IN IT.

02:12.044 --> 02:14.003
[sighs]
ALL RIGHT, WELL, UM,

02:14.046 --> 02:15.265
I'M GONNA GO ASK
THAT OLD LADY.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.745
MAYBE SHE'LL PLAY BALL.
SEE YA.

02:16.788 --> 02:18.399
WHOA, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
MAYBE WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.

02:18.442 --> 02:21.184
HOW?
I'M THINKING
JOINT CUSTODY.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.099
YOU GET THE TOTE BAG
DURING THE WEEK.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.275
I'LL TAKE THE TOTE BAG
ON THE WEEKENDS.

02:25.319 --> 02:26.581
YEAH,
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.ALL RIGHT, GREAT.

02:26.624 --> 02:28.148
SHALL WE GO SHAKESPEARE?

02:28.191 --> 02:30.019
NO, NO.
I DON'T SUPPORT SHAKESPEARE.

02:30.062 --> 02:32.674
I HEARD A STORY THAT HE
DIDN'T WRITE ANY OF HIS PLAYS.

02:32.717 --> 02:35.155
HE MADE HIS BUTLER WRITE THEM,
AND THEN HE TOOK ALL THE CREDIT.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.374
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THE BUTLER DID IT?

02:37.418 --> 02:39.115
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY DUMB.BUT IF IT IS TRUE,

02:39.159 --> 02:41.335
ISN'T THAT THE MOST DESPICABLE
THING YOU'VE EVER HEARD?

02:41.378 --> 02:43.119
SO DID YOU GET
YOUR TOTE BAG?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.207
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT WASN'T REALLY THAT GREAT,

02:44.251 --> 02:45.252
SO I GAVE IT
TO A HOMELESS GUY.

02:45.295 --> 02:46.731
BUT BEFORE THAT,

02:46.775 --> 02:48.080
HE TOOK ME
FOR FROZEN YOGURT.

02:48.124 --> 02:50.126
YEAH, SO THAT'S
WHEN I DECIDED

02:50.170 --> 02:52.215
THAT I WANTED
TO BE AN ARCHITECT.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.043
MM, NOPE.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.263
WHAT'S WRONG?MM-MM, NOTHING.

02:56.306 --> 02:57.916
IT'S JUST,
IT DOESN'T REALLY TASTE

02:57.960 --> 02:59.091
LIKE KEY LIME PIE.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.223
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.094
NO, I AM GONNA WORRY
ABOUT IT.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.487
LET'S GO FIX THIS.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.625
THIS ONE'S BAD TOO?

03:10.668 --> 03:12.192
UH...
COME ON, LET'S GO.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.020
MM.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.674
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

03:16.718 --> 03:18.241
DO YOU MAYBE
JUST HATE YOGURT?

03:21.897 --> 03:24.073
IT'S REALLY GOOD.THANK GOODNESS.

03:24.116 --> 03:26.597
YOU KNOW, IN THE END, THIS WALK
ONLY COST ME, LIKE, $50.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.164
UM, IT WAS WORTH IT.
I WILL PAY FOR DINNER.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.557
THAT ONLY SEEMS FAIR.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.688
[Danny]
WHAT A NIGHTMARE.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.299
FOUR DIFFERENT STOPS
JUST TO ASK YOU OUT?

03:32.342 --> 03:34.562
I MEAN, HOW MUCH TIME
DOES THIS GUY HAVE ON HIS HANDS?

03:34.605 --> 03:35.563
SOUNDS LIKE A BUM.

03:35.606 --> 03:36.912
UH, THAT'S RUDE.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.522
AND IT'S NOT TRUE.WHY?

03:38.566 --> 03:39.784
BECAUSE HE DOES
HAVE A JOB.

03:39.828 --> 03:41.177
GUYS, HE'S AN ARCHITECT. UGH.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.657
[both gasp] AN ARCHITECT?

03:42.700 --> 03:44.180
I MEAN, COME ON.
NO ONE'S REALLY AN ARCHITECT.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.226
I MEAN, THAT'S A JOB
THAT GUYS HAVE IN THE MOVIES.

03:46.269 --> 03:48.140
WELL, CALL ME, UH,
REESE WITHERSPOON,

03:48.184 --> 03:50.012
'CAUSE I'M GOING ON A DATE
WITH AN ARCHITECT TONIGHT.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.013
UP HERE. WHOO.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.536
NICE.THANK YOU.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.582

YEAH.

03:54.625 --> 03:57.454
OKAY.
BYE, GUYS.

03:58.412 --> 03:59.848
HMM.
UH, BEVERLY?

03:59.891 --> 04:01.284
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

04:01.328 --> 04:03.112
OH, I'M SORRY.
DO YOU WANT SOME PRIVACY?

04:03.155 --> 04:04.853
FOR WHAT?

04:04.896 --> 04:06.463
OKAY, UM, YESTERDAY
YOU TOLD ME

04:06.507 --> 04:07.943
THAT MRS. CHANG'S
BLOOD RESULTS

04:07.986 --> 04:10.554
WOULD BE READY TODAY,
BUT THEN I CALLED THE LAB,

04:10.598 --> 04:11.860
AND THEY SAID
YOU'D NEVER SUBMITTED THEM.

04:11.903 --> 04:13.078
I DON'T KNOW.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.080
MAYBE I LEFT 'EM
AT HOME.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.082
YOU TOOK BLOOD SAMPLES
HOME WITH YOU?

04:17.126 --> 04:18.954
I WANT TO CHANGE
WHAT I SAID.

04:18.997 --> 04:21.304
BEVERLY, HAVE YOU
BEEN SMOKING IN HERE?

04:21.348 --> 04:24.089
NO, MOM, I HAVE NOT
BEEN SMOKING POT IN HERE.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.657
WHOA, WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT SMOKING POT?

04:26.701 --> 04:28.311
LOOK, I'M HUNGRY.
I'M GOING TO LUNCH.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.312
MOVE, PLEASE.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.271
I--

04:31.314 --> 04:34.709
BEVERLY!
OKAY.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.624
WELCOME TO MY OFFICE,
EVERYONE,

04:36.667 --> 04:38.321
AND THANK YOU
FOR ATTENDING THIS MEETING.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.627
PLEASE,
ENJOY THESE REFRESHMENTS

04:39.670 --> 04:41.324
THAT I'VE THOUGHTFULLY
LAID OUT FOR YOU.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.326
SO NOW ANYONE
CAN JUST CALL A MEETING?

04:43.370 --> 04:44.414
WELL,
I'M A PARTNER HERE,

04:44.458 --> 04:45.850
AND IT'S NOT UNCOMMON
FOR A PARTNER

04:45.894 --> 04:47.156
TO CALL
A PARTNER-WIDE MEETING.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.549
IS IT OSCAR BALLOT
SEASON AGAIN?

04:48.592 --> 04:50.464
NO, NOT YET.
THAT'S MARCH AND FEBRUARY.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.074
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL LET YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT.

04:52.117 --> 04:53.336
THIS IS ACTUALLY SERIOUS.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.946
WE HAVE ALL KNOWN
FOR A LONG TIME

04:54.990 --> 04:56.557
THAT BEVERLY
IS AWFUL AND BAD,

04:56.600 --> 04:58.907
BUT IT USED TO JUST BE
THAT YOU WOULD KIND OF HOPE

04:58.950 --> 05:01.083
YOU NEVER INTERACTED
WITH HER DURING THE DAY.

05:01.126 --> 05:03.128
TODAY I FOUND THESE
UNDER A CUSHION

05:03.172 --> 05:05.217
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM SOFA.

05:05.261 --> 05:06.262
BLOOD, YOU GUYS.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.350
OH.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.787
THIS ONE SAYS
"SHORT, COMMA, ASIAN,"

05:09.831 --> 05:11.354
AND THIS ONE
SIMPLY SAYS "FAT LADY."

05:11.398 --> 05:12.703
SHE'S AWFUL.
LET'S JUST SACK HER.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.705
I LIKE BEVERLY.
SHE'S OLD SCHOOL.

05:14.749 --> 05:15.924
YOU KNOW, I HATE
WHEN PEOPLE SAY "OLD SCHOOL,"

05:15.967 --> 05:17.534
WHEN ALL THEY MEAN
IS "INEFFICIENT AND RUDE."

05:17.578 --> 05:19.754
LIKE, "OH, HOW CHARMING,
THAT MEAN OLD WAITER

05:19.797 --> 05:21.321
TOLD ME TO PUT AWAY
MY CELL PHONE AT DINNER."

05:21.364 --> 05:22.713
THAT'S WHY
I ONLY EAT AT CHAINS.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.672
THAT'S NOT OLD SCHOOL.
I'M TALKING OLD SCHOOL.

05:24.715 --> 05:26.151
WHAT DOES THAT--
I DON'T--THAT HAS NO MEANING.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.414
YOU'RE RIGHT, MINDALA.

05:27.457 --> 05:28.850
BEVERLY HAS GOT TO GO. YEAH.

05:28.893 --> 05:30.982
JEREMY,
BREAK THE NEWS TO HER.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.594
YOU WANT ME TO FIRE HER?
[laughs]

05:33.637 --> 05:35.639
UH, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT, UH, NOT FOR ME.

05:35.683 --> 05:36.858
NO, NO, NO.
I'M TELLING YOU TO.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.425
LISTEN, HEARING YOU'RE FIRED
IS BAD ENOUGH,

05:38.468 --> 05:39.556
BUT FROM ME?

05:39.600 --> 05:41.471
WHY IS IT ESPECIALLY BAD
COMING FROM YOU?

05:41.515 --> 05:44.169
WELL, WE WANT TO FIRE HER,
NOT DESTROY HER.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.301
OH, GOD.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.346
JEREMY, DO IT.

05:46.389 --> 05:47.390
RIGHT.

05:47.434 --> 05:48.565
NOW, WITHOUT BEVERLY,

05:48.609 --> 05:50.306
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
TO HIRE A NEW NURSE.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.351
DANNY.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.178
OH! OH! NO, WAIT.
I WANT TO DO IT.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.180
YEAH, RIGHT.
NO, PLEASE.
PLEASE, LET ME DO IT.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.705
NOW THAT I'M IN
MY MID 20s TO EARLY 30s,

05:57.748 --> 05:59.054
I JUST REALLY
WANT TO TAKE ON

05:59.097 --> 06:00.751
MORE OF
A LEADERSHIP ROLE HERE.

06:00.795 --> 06:01.926
AND AS A WOMAN OF COLOR--

06:01.970 --> 06:03.537
OH, COME ON,
THIS AGAIN?
NO.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.626
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?I LIKE THAT KIND OF PLUCK.

06:05.669 --> 06:06.801
OKAY.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.672
MINDY,
YOU WILL BE IN CHARGE

06:08.716 --> 06:09.760
OF HIRING THE NEW NURSE.

06:09.804 --> 06:11.632
OKAY, OKAY,
SO, JUST FOR THE RECORD,

06:11.675 --> 06:13.460
THIS RESPONSIBILITY
HAS BEEN GIVEN TO SOMEONE

06:13.503 --> 06:15.375
THAT'S GOT A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN
IN HER OFFICE.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.812
[fountain whirring]THIS IS AMAZING.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.988
PEOPLE LOVE THIS.

06:20.031 --> 06:22.686
AND, GUYS, I DIDN'T SAY
"MEETING ADJOURNED."

06:22.730 --> 06:25.036
MEETING ADJOURNED.

06:27.517 --> 06:28.518
[knocks]

06:28.562 --> 06:30.433
BEVERLY,
COULD I HAVE A WORD?

06:30.477 --> 06:32.479
WHY ARE YOU WEARING
A WET SUIT?

06:32.522 --> 06:33.741
THIS ISN'T A WET SUIT.

06:33.784 --> 06:36.178
THIS IS SKINNY PANTS
AND A FITTED SHIRT.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.614
BEVERLY,
WE NEED TO TALK.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.442
CAN I SEE YOU
FOR A MOMENT OUTSIDE?

06:39.486 --> 06:41.531
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.751
BUT YOU GOT
TO ZIP ME UP FIRST.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.628
HOW DO I LOOK?

06:51.672 --> 06:53.456
LIKE A LIBRARIAN
IN A PORN MOVIE.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.023
GWEN, COME ON. NO, YOU LOOK GREAT.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.416
THIS TOOK A LOT OF TI-- SORRY.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.461
ALL RIGHT.THE ZIPPERED BUSTIER
IS A BOLD CHOICE,

06:58.505 --> 07:01.029
BUT BOLD CHOICES ARE WHAT BEING
A LEADER IS ALL ABOUT.

07:01.072 --> 07:02.857
THANK YOU.
YES.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.511
I AM GOING TO HIRE
THE HELL OUT OF SOMEONE TODAY.HIRE THEIR ASS OFF.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.513
EMPLOY THE CRAP
OUT OF THEM.
MM-HMM.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.645
OH, WAIT, YOU HAVE TO SEE
THIS GUY FROM THE BOOKSTORE.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.692
UM, IT'S HARD TO SEE HIM

07:11.735 --> 07:13.520
THROUGH THESE STRINGS
OF BLACK MATERIAL.

07:13.563 --> 07:14.999
OH, YEAH, I DIDN'T
WANT HIM TO KNOW

07:15.043 --> 07:17.132
I WAS TAKING A PHOTO OF HIM,
SO I KIND OF TOOK A PICTURE

07:17.175 --> 07:18.394
THROUGH A CURTAIN
OF MY OWN HAIR.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.701
UH, YOU KNOW,
HE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A GUY

07:20.744 --> 07:22.964

HANGING IN A STEAK HOUSE.

07:23.007 --> 07:25.053
YES, EXACTLY,
LIKE HE DIED 70 YEARS AGO,

07:25.096 --> 07:26.228
THEN HE CAME BACK TO LIFE

07:26.271 --> 07:27.272
JUST SO HE COULD GO
ON THIS DATE WITH ME--

07:27.316 --> 07:28.883
TONIGHT, BY THE WAY,
AFTER WORK.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.537
OOH, THAT IS GREAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:30.580 --> 07:32.190
JUST DON'T GO ANYWHERE
THAT DOESN'T HAVE RECEPTION,

07:32.234 --> 07:33.496
AND WHEN HE REACHES
IN HIS POCKETS...

07:33.540 --> 07:34.671
KNOW THAT IT COULD BE
A KNIFE OR A SWITCHBLADE.

07:34.715 --> 07:35.846
YES. NO, OF COURSE.

07:35.890 --> 07:36.978
WE SAW THE SAME TODAY
SHOW SEGMENT.

07:37.021 --> 07:39.589
AND IT'S SMART,
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I--

07:39.633 --> 07:40.590
OH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:40.634 --> 07:42.418
I THINK
I SEE JOAQUIN PHOENIX.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.681
WHAT?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?NO.

07:44.725 --> 07:47.728
WHAT IS HE DOING?
IS HE BEING WEIRD?

07:47.771 --> 07:50.731
[playing somber piano chords]

07:50.774 --> 07:53.560
â™ª

07:53.603 --> 07:54.909
OH, LOOK AT YOU,

07:54.952 --> 07:56.563
ALL HURT.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.434
I'M NOT HURT.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.741
I'M JUST
WORKING ON MY CHORDS.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.786
DANNY...

08:02.830 --> 08:05.528
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT
JUST YOU AND ME ANYMORE.

08:05.572 --> 08:08.009
WE DECIDED TO EXPAND.
YOU NEED TO ACCEPT THAT.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.445
REMEMBER WHEN MINDY'S OFFICE

08:09.489 --> 08:10.925
WAS USED FOR STORAGE?

08:10.968 --> 08:12.187
NOW, THAT WAS GREAT.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.623
I'D KEEP MY BIKE THERE
ALL WINTER.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.538
YES, AND YOU ADAPTED.
NOW YOU'RE FINE.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.713
FINE FOR NOW, BUT...

08:16.757 --> 08:18.541
NOW SHE'S IN CHARGE
OF THE HIRING.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.588
BEFORE LONG,
MINDY HIRES ANOTHER MINDY.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.372
THAT MINDY HIRES
TWO MORE MINDYS.

08:23.415 --> 08:24.939
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
YAP YAP YAP.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.201
"DID YOU SEE THAT MOVIE?"

08:26.244 --> 08:27.985
"DID YOU HEAR ABOUT
THAT CELEBRITY BREAKUP?"

08:28.029 --> 08:29.639
YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP.
I MEAN, WHERE DO I PUT MY BIKE?

08:29.683 --> 08:31.815
LOOK, MINDY
IS GOING TO DO A GREAT JOB

08:31.859 --> 08:34.078
HIRING THE NEW NURSE.

08:34.122 --> 08:36.646
BUT...

08:36.690 --> 08:38.430
IF YOU HAPPEN
TO SEE HER DOING SOMETHING

08:38.474 --> 08:40.084
THAT YOU DON'T THINK
IS GOOD FOR THE PRACTICE,

08:40.128 --> 08:43.435
JUST STEP IN,
LEND A HELPING HAND.

08:44.698 --> 08:45.568
COOL.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.570
WHY DID I BECOME A NURSE?

08:47.614 --> 08:50.486
UH, IT WAS JUST
A MILLION TINY, LITTLE THINGS

08:50.530 --> 08:52.227
THAT, WHEN YOU
ADDED THEM ALL UP,

08:52.270 --> 08:55.491
JUST MEANT THAT THIS IS WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.275
IS THAT FROM SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE?

08:57.319 --> 08:59.626
YES, THAT IS FROM
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.

08:59.669 --> 09:00.714
THAT IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.063
REALLY?
YES.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.847
IT USED TO BE
MY FAVORITE MOVIE,

09:03.891 --> 09:05.545
BUT NOW
IT'S GOT TO BE

09:05.588 --> 09:07.155
YOU'VE GOT MAIL. OH, NO.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.591
NO, NO, NO, NO. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WAIT. I'M SORRY.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.071
NOPE. THAT IS ACTUALLY MY FAVORITE MOVIE.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.073
SO NICE TO MEET YOU,
CLAIRE.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.509
IT WAS SO NICE
TO MEET YOU.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.597
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR HAVING ME,

09:14.641 --> 09:16.120
AND GOOD LUCK
WITH THAT DATE.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.601
THANK YOU.
BYE.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.908
UM, I LOVED HER.

09:20.951 --> 09:24.651
SEND IN
THE NEXT APPLICANT.

09:25.695 --> 09:26.827
OH, DANNY, I'M SORRY.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.263
I CAN'T HANG OUT
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

09:28.306 --> 09:29.699
I'M INTERVIEWING
NURSE APPLICANTS.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.614
I'M NOT HERE TO HANG OUT.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.921
DR. SHULMAN SAID YOU NEEDED
SOME SUPERVISION.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.618
NO, HE DIDN'T.
YEAH, HE DID.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.141
RIGHT THERE,
IN MY OFFICE.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.621
WELL, WE WILL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

09:38.665 --> 09:39.883
AS SHE STOOD THERE

09:39.927 --> 09:41.624
WITH THAT DOPEY LOOK
ON HER FACE,

09:41.668 --> 09:43.147
SHE REALIZED
SHE HAD JUST BEEN OUTRANKED

09:43.191 --> 09:44.714
BY DANIEL CASTELLANO...

09:44.758 --> 09:45.889
JERK.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.500
HANDSOME DOCTOR.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.026
DR. SHULMAN,
DANNY IS FORCING

09:52.069 --> 09:54.506
HIS BIG, FAT BUTT
IN MY NURSE INTERVIEWS,

09:54.550 --> 09:56.117
AND HE SAID THAT YOU SAID
THAT IT WAS OKAY.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.771
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE TATTLING.
SHE'S TATTLING.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.424
UH, TATTLING IS WHEN
A LITTLE GIRL DOES IT.

09:59.468 --> 10:00.904
WHEN A HOT WOMAN DOES IT,
IT'S CALLED "WHISTLE-BLOWING."

10:00.948 --> 10:02.297
I JUST WANT WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE PRACTICE.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.125
SO I WANT WHAT'S WORST
FOR THE PRACTICE?

10:04.168 --> 10:05.692
I JUST WANT TO HIRE
SOME AL-QAEDA TERRORIST

10:05.735 --> 10:07.041
TO COME AND BLOW UP
THE KITCHEN?

10:07.084 --> 10:08.259
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU DO IT ON PURPOSE,

10:08.303 --> 10:09.565
BUT, YES,
THAT COULD EASILY HAPPEN.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.827
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?THAT COULD HAPPEN!

10:10.871 --> 10:13.090
GUYS, GUYS,
IF YOU TWO WORK TOGETHER,

10:13.134 --> 10:15.832
YOU WILL AVOID HIRING
ANY AL-QAEDA TERRORISTS,

10:15.876 --> 10:17.051
FOR SURE.

10:17.094 --> 10:18.400
BUT IF--
NOW GO.

10:18.443 --> 10:20.445
SCRAM.

10:20.489 --> 10:21.925
OKAY.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.797
BEVERLY,

10:23.840 --> 10:26.451
AREN'T YOU YEARNING TO EXPLORE
OUTSIDE THESE OFFICES?

10:26.495 --> 10:28.323
AREN'T YOU LOOKING TO SEE
THE WORLD?

10:28.366 --> 10:30.368
WELL, SOMETIMES
I HAVE THIS DREAM

10:30.412 --> 10:31.979
I AIN'T WORKING HERE
ANYMORE,

10:32.022 --> 10:34.590
AND I CAN DO
WHATEVER I WANT.AND THEN WHAT?

10:34.634 --> 10:37.288
I'M THE DEN MOTHER
FOR A SHEIK'S HAREM--

10:37.332 --> 10:40.204
YOU KNOW, MAKING SURE
THEY DON'T ESCAPE--

10:40.248 --> 10:44.905
WITH A SIDE BUSINESS
WAXING 'EM AND STUFF.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.168
WELL, THIS IS STRESSFULLY
LAST MINUTE,

10:47.211 --> 10:48.822
BUT HERE, JUST CATCH UP
ON THESE RESUMES QUICK.

10:48.865 --> 10:51.694
I DON'T READ RESUMES.
I GO FROM THE GUT.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.087
I'M SORRY.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.219
SO, INSTEAD OF LOOKING
AT A CANDIDATE'S QUALIFICATIONS,

10:55.263 --> 10:57.221
YOU'RE JUST GONNA DECIDE
WITH YOUR WEIRD, LUMPY GUT?

10:57.265 --> 10:59.963
THEY'RE NOT LUMPS.
THEY'RE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.312
YOU GET THEM
FROM DOING SIT-UPS.

11:01.356 --> 11:03.271
SIT-UPS ARE
A TYPE OF EXERCISE.

11:03.314 --> 11:04.968
NOW, LET'S SET
SOME GROUND RULES.

11:05.012 --> 11:05.969
NO CRYING.

11:06.013 --> 11:07.971
WHAT?
WHY WOULD I CRY?

11:08.015 --> 11:10.365
YOU CRIED AT A BOX
OF GIRL SCOUT COOKIES.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.497
DANNY, A LITTLE BLACK GIRL
AND A LITTLE WHITE GIRL

11:12.541 --> 11:13.847
WERE PETTING A HORSE
TOGETHER.

11:13.890 --> 11:14.891
SORRY FOR BEING HUMAN.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.284
IF WE HAVE
TO DO THIS TOGETHER,

11:16.327 --> 11:17.415
HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA GO.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.156
WE BOTH HAVE THE POWER
TO NIX ANYONE.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.767
FINE, AND TO HIRE SOMEONE,
WE BOTH HAVE TO AGREE.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.290
FINE.
FINE. LET'S SHAKE ON IT.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.639
I DON'T NEED TO SHAKE.
I AGREE VERBALLY.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.380
HANDSHAKE.
VERBALLY.

11:27.774 --> 11:30.341
WHAT'S YOUR FEELING
ABOUT SOCIALIZING AT WORK?

11:30.385 --> 11:31.995
AT WORK, YOU WORK.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.997
YOU KEEP
YOUR PRIVATE LIFE PRIVATE--

11:34.041 --> 11:35.085
END OF STORY.

11:35.129 --> 11:37.392
THAT'S REALLY
REFRESHING.

11:37.435 --> 11:40.047
UM, THANKS FOR COMING IN, DEENA.
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.704
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
SHE WAS PERFECT.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.967
FOR WHAT?
THE SOVIET WEIGHTLIFTING TEAM?

11:47.010 --> 11:48.708
[Jeremy]
I WANT TO TELL YOU
THE STORY

11:48.751 --> 11:51.362
OF A LITTLE BOY
WHO WAS SENT AWAY

11:51.406 --> 11:53.582
TO BOARDING SCHOOL
MUCH TOO YOUNG--

11:53.625 --> 11:55.323
WHAT'S BOARDING SCHOOL?

11:55.366 --> 11:57.238
LIKE, A SCHOOL WHERE YOU
LEARN SNOWBOARDING?

11:57.281 --> 11:58.326
PLEASE, JUST LISTEN.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.414
WHAT'S SNOWBOARDING?

11:59.457 --> 12:01.329
OKAY, AND HOW
THAT EARLY TRAUMA

12:01.372 --> 12:04.419
CONTRIBUTED TO
A LIFELONG INABILITY TO COMMIT.

12:04.462 --> 12:07.335
BEVERLY, THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU.

12:07.378 --> 12:11.121
[sighs]
OH, I GET WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.470
THANK GOD.

12:12.514 --> 12:13.471
HOW DO YOU WANT ME?

12:13.515 --> 12:16.213
UM, NO, I-I REALLY
DIDN'T MEAN--

12:16.257 --> 12:17.475
MRS. HUTTON,
WHAT IS YOUR FEELING

12:17.519 --> 12:19.260
ABOUT BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS
IN THE OFFICE?

12:19.303 --> 12:21.697
WELL, WHEN YOU GET
TO BE MY AGE, YOUNG MAN,

12:21.741 --> 12:23.438
YOU REALLY START
TO APPRECIATE THEM.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.656
SEE, I DISAGREE
WITH THAT.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.354
YOU DISAGREE
WITH HER FEELING?

12:26.397 --> 12:27.747
A BIRTHDAY'S
NOT AN ACHIEVEMENT.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.618
EVERYONE HAS A BIRTHDAY--
SERIAL KILLERS, RAPISTS.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.576
I'M SORRY.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.187
SO SHE LIKES HER BIRTHDAY,
AND NOW SHE'S A SERIAL KILLER?

12:33.230 --> 12:34.797
THAT'S JUST THE WAY
THE CALENDAR WORKS.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.190
IF A GUY DIDN'T HAVE
A BIRTHDAY,

12:36.233 --> 12:37.452
NOW, THAT WOULD BE
INTERESTING.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.454
I'M SORRY, DANNY,
SHE'S A MILLION YEARS OLD.

12:39.497 --> 12:40.716
LET HER ENJOY
HER BIRTHDAY.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.022
BELIEVE ME, MINDY,

12:42.065 --> 12:44.502
YOU'LL FIND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES
TO EAT CAKE.

12:44.546 --> 12:45.808
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.810
TOP FIVE--
BORN TO RUN,

12:47.854 --> 12:49.377
DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN,
THE RISING,

12:49.420 --> 12:51.161
WRECKING BALL-- THANKS FOR COMING IN.

12:51.205 --> 12:55.122
PAX, MADDOX,
ZAHARA, SHILOH, KNOX.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.732
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.300
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
IT'S REALLY GREAT TO MEET YOU.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.518
HOW YOU DOING?

13:00.562 --> 13:02.520
[Mindy]
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

13:02.564 --> 13:05.001
TWO YEARS AT JOHNS HOPKINS
SCHOOL OF NURSING,

13:05.045 --> 13:07.264
WORKED IN A MEDEVAC UNIT
IN KANDAHAR, AND HERE I AM.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.745
WOW.
THESE CREDENTIALS
ARE PERFECT.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.399
I SHOULD BE
A DOCTOR, HUH?

13:11.442 --> 13:13.880
YEAH, WE ALREADY HAVE TOO MANY
OF THOSE AROUND HERE.

13:13.923 --> 13:15.446
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

13:15.490 --> 13:17.361
OH, I WAS JUST--
JUST JOKING AROUND.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.842
I DON'T THINK YOU ARE, ACTUALLY,
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER, LAURA,

13:19.886 --> 13:21.409
BECAUSE HE HAS
NO AUTHORITY HERE.

13:21.452 --> 13:22.802
ACTUALLY, I DO.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.107
ARE YOU IN CHARGE
OF BEING A DOUCHE BAG?

13:24.151 --> 13:25.326
'CAUSE YOU'RE DOING
A GREAT JOB.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.631
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.242
DR. SHULMAN
GAVE YOU A TASK

13:28.285 --> 13:29.721
THAT HE KNEW YOU WOULD FAIL
SO HE'D NEVER HAVE TO GIVE YOU

13:29.765 --> 13:31.158
ANYTHING IMPORTANT TO DO
EVER AGAIN.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.289
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:32.333 --> 13:33.551
YOU'RE JUST ANGRY,
'CAUSE DR. SHULMAN

13:33.595 --> 13:34.639
HAS ALWAYS LIKED ME
BETTER THAN HE LIKES YOU.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.032
HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU
BETTER THAN HE--

13:36.076 --> 13:36.816
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?YES, HE DOES.
YEAH, HE DOES.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.382
THAT'S WHY
HE GAVE ME THIS JOB.

13:38.426 --> 13:39.993
OH, HE GAVE YOU THIS JOB?
HE SENT ME IN HERE.

13:40.036 --> 13:42.082
HEY! HEY! HEY!
[claps]

13:42.125 --> 13:43.213
THAT'S ENOUGH.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.650
I'VE SEEN CHILD SOLDIERS
IN AFRICA

13:45.694 --> 13:46.738
WITH BETTER MANNERS.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.610
I WOULD NEVER WORK HERE.

13:48.653 --> 13:51.831
UGH! WHAT A WASTE
OF MY TIME THIS WAS.

13:53.136 --> 13:55.617
GOD, SHE SUCKED.DRAMA QUEEN. GOD.

13:58.315 --> 14:00.361
THIS IS A RIDICULOUS WASTE
OF MY TIME.

14:00.404 --> 14:03.277
MAYBE I SHOULD BE TRYING
TO HIRE SOME NEW ASSOCIATES

14:03.320 --> 14:05.409
WHO CAN ACTUALLY ASSOCIATE
WITH EACH OTHER.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.324
DR. SHULMAN,
LET'S NOT OVERREACT HERE.

14:07.368 --> 14:11.024
THE IRONIC THING IS THAT
DANNY AND I ARE BEST FRIENDS.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.416
AND WE HIDE
OUR FRIENDSHIP AT WORK

14:12.460 --> 14:13.635
FOR PROFESSIONAL REASONS.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.203
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
DANNY?
YEAH.

14:16.246 --> 14:17.421
I MEAN, UH,
DEFINITELY.

14:17.465 --> 14:18.901
ONE TIME, WE TOOK
THE SUBWAY TOGETHER.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.294
I REMEMBER THAT!

14:20.337 --> 14:21.686
THAT WAS AWESOME. WASN'T THAT GREAT?

14:21.730 --> 14:23.079
AND LAST WEEK

14:23.123 --> 14:24.602
WE WENT TO THE FLEA MARKET.
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

14:24.646 --> 14:26.256
YEAH, AND ON THE WAY HOME,
I SAVED HER FROM A MUGGER.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.432
I WAS LIKE, "GET--
NOBODY MUGS MY FRIEND."

14:28.476 --> 14:30.782
AND SHE WAS CRYING,
AND THERE WAS, YOU KNOW,

14:30.826 --> 14:33.089
SNOT EVERYWHERE.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.483
WHAT WAS WEIRD WAS
WE RAN INTO ANOTHER MUGGER,

14:35.526 --> 14:36.788
AND THIS TIME,
I SAVED HIM.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.312
SO WE WERE EVEN.

14:38.355 --> 14:39.530
UH, WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD
WAS THIS IN?

14:39.574 --> 14:41.489
IT WAS BY THE DOCKS.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.578
OKAY,
THIS IS ALL WEIRD NEWS.

14:43.621 --> 14:46.450
I JUST WISH
THAT YOU COULD APPLY

14:46.494 --> 14:49.018
THAT COLLEGIALITY
HERE AT WORK

14:49.062 --> 14:50.846
SO WE WOULDN'T BE
IN THIS MESS.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.456
[knock at door] DOCTORS?

14:52.500 --> 14:55.546
THERE'S ONE LAST NURSE CANDIDATE
THAT JUST ARRIVED.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.287
I COULD SEND HIM AWAY.
I KIND OF WANT TO.

14:57.331 --> 14:58.549
NO, HE SOUNDS GREAT.

14:58.593 --> 15:00.247
YEAH, UH, DANNY,
LET'S GO INTERVIEW THAT GUY.

15:00.290 --> 15:01.944
GREAT IDEA, FRIEND.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.511
WELL, DR. SHULMAN...
OKAY.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.382
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
AFTER YOU, FRIEND.

15:05.426 --> 15:08.385
OH, THANK YOU, MINDY.
THAT'S SO KIND OF YOU.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.261
SO YOUR NAME IS...

15:14.304 --> 15:16.306
RANSOM TOOKERS?

15:16.350 --> 15:18.178
MM-HMM.

15:18.221 --> 15:19.483
HONESTLY?

15:19.527 --> 15:22.704
YOU WOULDN'T ASK
A BLACK WOMAN NAMED DESTINY

15:22.747 --> 15:23.792
IF THAT WAS REALLY
HER NAME.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.228
[scoffs]
THIS FEELS RACIAL.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.491
YOU'RE NOT A BLACK WOMAN.

15:27.535 --> 15:30.451
OKAY, MY NAME IS MORGAN.

15:30.494 --> 15:31.974
MORGAN TOOKERS.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.410
BUT IF I WORKED HERE,

15:33.454 --> 15:34.585
I WOULD LIKE
TO GO BY "RANSOM."

15:34.629 --> 15:36.065
OH, THAT'S
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.066
WHEN I STARTED HERE,

15:37.110 --> 15:38.285
I WANTED THEM
TO CALL ME "CHLOE."

15:38.328 --> 15:39.373
MORGAN, WHY DO YOU
WANT TO BE A NURSE HERE?

15:39.416 --> 15:42.376
THIS JOB, I COULD
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.291
I THINK THE ATTITUDE OF
"I COULD TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT"

15:44.334 --> 15:45.553
IS SOMETHING YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO PROJECT,

15:45.596 --> 15:47.033
NOT ACTUALLY ARTICULATE.

15:47.076 --> 15:50.297
OKAY, BUSTED.
BUSTED.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.689
REAL TALK--

15:51.733 --> 15:54.475
SPENT A COUPLE YEARS
IN OTISVILLE IN MY LATE TEENS.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.390
IS THAT A COLLEGE?IT'S A PRISON UPSTATE.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.695
I'M REALLY INTERESTED NOW,
BY THE WAY.

15:57.739 --> 16:00.437
SHOULDN'T BE SOMETHING
YOU JUST PROJECT?

16:00.481 --> 16:02.048
UNH!

16:05.442 --> 16:07.879
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I'M NERVOUS RIGHT NOW.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.446
I'M...

16:09.490 --> 16:12.319
UGH. I GOT
ARMPIT SWEAT GOING.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.538
LOOK, MAN, MY COUSIN LOU AND I
USED TO JACK CARS.

16:14.582 --> 16:17.019
I'M NOT PROUD OF IT,
BUT I CLEANED UP,

16:17.063 --> 16:19.456
GOT MY NURSING LICENSE,
AND FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS,

16:19.500 --> 16:20.936
I'VE BEEN LIVING
WITH GRANDMOTHER.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.155
WHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?

16:22.198 --> 16:23.112
UPPER BODY.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.462
UH, I OWN
MY OWN SCRUBS.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.942
ALSO, WHEN IT COMES
TO DRAWING BLOOD,

16:26.986 --> 16:29.249
I'M SO PAINLESS
I'M LIKE A GIANT MOSQUITO.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.728
WHY DON'T WE, UH, GET BACK
TO YOUR TIME IN PRISON.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.165
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

16:32.208 --> 16:35.298
TO MAKE SURE I NEVER
GO BACK TO MY OLD LIFE,

16:35.342 --> 16:37.431
I GOT THIS TATTOO.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.433
LOOK.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.565
THIS REMINDS ME,
"NO MORE STEALING CARS"

16:41.609 --> 16:42.740
IT'S HEALED.
YOU CAN TOUCH IT.

16:42.784 --> 16:43.828
I'M OKAY, THANK YOU.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.526
INDIAN GIRLS
NEVER WANT TO TOUCH IT.

16:45.569 --> 16:46.614
[laughs]
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

16:46.657 --> 16:47.745
OTHER DOCTOR,
YOU WANT IN?

16:47.789 --> 16:48.746
I'M GOOD.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.792
YOU GOT IT.

16:50.835 --> 16:52.054
I'M SO GLAD
YOU STOPPED BY.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.143
I FEEL THAT YOU COULD BE
A FASCINATING SUBJECT

16:54.187 --> 16:55.405
OF A DOCUMENTARY SHORT.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.842
THANK YOU.
[chuckles]

16:57.886 --> 16:59.279
AND WHAT ABOUT THIS?
IS THIS GONNA HAPPEN?

16:59.322 --> 17:00.367
YOU DID NOT GET THE JOB.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.586
IS HE WRONG?
DID I GET THE JOB?

17:02.630 --> 17:03.848
HE'S CORRECT, ACTUALLY.

17:03.892 --> 17:06.764
I'M SORRY.
WE COULD NEVER HIRE YOU HERE.

17:06.808 --> 17:09.419
WOW.

17:09.463 --> 17:13.119
I'M A LITTLE DEVASTATED.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.816
[choked up]
THANK YOU.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.861
[Mindy]
THANK YOU FOR COMING BY.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.950
I CANNOT BELIEVE
WE DIDN'T FIND A NURSE.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.387
DR. SHULMAN GAVE ME
ONE RESPONSIBILITY,

17:20.430 --> 17:21.388
AND I COULDN'T EVEN DO THAT.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.216
DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.521
IT WAS PARTIALLY
MY FAULT.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.480
WHAT? IT WAS COMPLETELY
YOUR FAULT.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.960
IT WASN'T MY FAULT AT ALL.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE NICE.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.527
[Mindy]
WHY DID YOU SAY ANYTHING?

17:30.571 --> 17:32.877
HELLO. IS THERE ANY WAY
I COULD USE YOUR RESTROOM

17:32.921 --> 17:33.878
BEFORE I LEAVE?

17:33.922 --> 17:34.923
YES.

17:34.966 --> 17:36.229
MY GRANDMOTHER
LIVES IN ROCKAWAY.

17:36.272 --> 17:37.404
I CAN'T MAKE IT
ALL THE WAY.

17:37.447 --> 17:38.361
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING.

17:38.405 --> 17:40.189
I SAID "YES."

17:40.233 --> 17:41.451
ALSO, CAN I GRAB
A BOTTLE OF WATER

17:41.495 --> 17:43.410
TO REPLENISH THE FLUIDS
I'M GONNA LOSE?

17:43.453 --> 17:46.239
LET'S GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.LET'S DO IT.

17:46.282 --> 17:47.283
TAKE TWO.WHOA!

17:47.327 --> 17:50.069
[Morgan] THANK YOU, FRIEND.

18:00.818 --> 18:03.125
HEY.
HEY, UM...

18:03.169 --> 18:04.518
WHY IS BEVERLY STILL HERE?

18:04.561 --> 18:06.520
WHY ARE ANY OF US
STILL HERE?

18:06.563 --> 18:08.043
I MEAN, WHAT,
WITH NUCLEAR WAR

18:08.087 --> 18:10.480
AND THE DEGRADATION
OF OUR PRECIOUS ENVIRONMENT...

18:10.524 --> 18:12.265
YOU DIDN'T FIRE HER?

18:12.308 --> 18:13.744
NOT TRUE.

18:13.788 --> 18:15.964
I SENT HER AN EMAIL MAKING IT
VERY CLEAR SHE WAS FIRED.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.139
BEVERLY DOESN'T EVEN
CHECK HER EMAIL

18:17.183 --> 18:18.619
UNTIL HER SON VISITS
AT CHRISTMAS.

18:18.662 --> 18:21.100
I KNOW. I'M THE WORST.
[groans, chuckles]

18:21.143 --> 18:22.797
SOMEONE IN THIS OFFICE
HAS TO BE HONEST WITH HER

18:22.840 --> 18:24.233
SO THAT SHE CAN GET ON
WITH HER LIFE.

18:24.277 --> 18:27.236
[sighs]

18:29.847 --> 18:31.284
BEVERLY, I'M SORRY
I HAVE TO BE

18:31.327 --> 18:32.720
THE ONE TO TELL YOU THIS,

18:32.763 --> 18:34.200
BUT I GUESS
I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE

18:34.243 --> 18:36.941
WHO RESPECTS YOU ENOUGH
TO BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.073
YOU ARE UNRELIABLE.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.075
YOU ARE OFTEN INCOHERENT,

18:40.119 --> 18:42.991
AND THEN WHEN YOU DO MAKE SENSE,
YOU ARE SURLY AND RUDE.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.819
I'M SORRY, BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO LET YOU GO.

18:44.862 --> 18:47.213
ARE YOU FIRING ME?

18:47.256 --> 18:50.216
UNFORTUNATELY, YES.
YEAH.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.217
OHH!

18:51.260 --> 18:52.914

18:54.655 --> 18:55.699
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:55.743 --> 18:56.918

18:56.961 --> 18:58.354
SHE DIDN'T BREAK YOUR NOSE.YES, SHE DID!

18:58.398 --> 18:59.964

BREAK YOUR NOSE, OKAY?YES, SHE DID.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.276

JUST LET ME SEE IT.OKAY, OKAY.

19:10.279 --> 19:11.759
[all scream]

19:11.802 --> 19:13.152
THAT'S A LOT OF BLOOD.WHY DID THEY SCREAM
LIKE THAT?

19:13.195 --> 19:15.197
STOP FREAKING OUT!I'M NOT FREAKING OUT!

OKAY, DO YOU TRUST ME?NO.

19:25.903 --> 19:27.166
CAN YOU HANDLE PAIN?

19:27.209 --> 19:28.515
NO.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.386
OKAY, SWEETHEART, THIS
IS GONNA HURT LIKE A BITCH.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.258
WHAT?ON THREE.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.870
I DID IT ON TWO.
I DID IT ON TWO.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.654
ALL RIGHT?

19:37.698 --> 19:39.526
IT'S OVER. IT'S OVER.
OKAY.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.136
OKAY.
YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.225
COTTON BALLS
UP THE NOSTRILS.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.184
KEEP IT COOL, OKAY?

19:45.227 --> 19:46.620
NO SEX FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.535
IF YOU HAVE SEX,

19:48.578 --> 19:50.058
MISSIONARY'S
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

19:50.101 --> 19:51.929
IF YOU DO DO MISSIONARY,

19:51.973 --> 19:53.583
YOU NEED TO REMEMBER--YOU'RE HIRED.

19:53.627 --> 19:54.802

20:00.460 --> 20:02.201
YOU WOULDN'T LET ME HIRE
ANY OF THE GREAT PEOPLE

20:02.244 --> 20:03.202
I WANTED TO HIRE EARLIER.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.464
AND THEN
I WAS THE ONLY ONE

20:04.507 --> 20:06.117
PROFESSIONAL ENOUGH
TO FIRE BEVERLY,

20:06.161 --> 20:07.728
AND I GOT PUNCHED

20:15.083 --> 20:16.911

20:16.954 --> 20:18.521
DANNY, STOP IT.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.024
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH NELSON MANDELA?

20:47.115 --> 20:48.072
IT'LL HEAL SOON.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.291
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT SOON, DANNY.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.640
I CARE ABOUT NOW.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.512
MY LOOKS ARE VERY IMPORTANT
TO ME, ALL RIGHT?

20:52.555 --> 20:55.166
UNFORTUNATELY, WE LIVE
IN A SOCIETY THAT PUTS A PREMIUM

20:55.210 --> 20:56.472
ON WHITE WOMEN
WITH PERFECT NOSES,

20:56.516 --> 20:57.778
AND RIGHT NOW
I'M 0-FOR-2.

20:57.821 --> 21:00.128
CAN YOU NOT BE SO LOUD?
YOU'RE MAKING A SCENE.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.784
I'M SORRY, BABY.

21:03.827 --> 21:06.221
PLEASE, DON'T BE MAD
AT ME AGAIN.
OH, BOY.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.223
I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU UPSET, SWEETHEART.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.877
I DIDN'T HIT
THIS WOMAN, OKAY?

21:09.920 --> 21:11.313
HE DID NOT MEAN
TO HIT ME.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.488
MY HUSBAND IS NOT A MONSTER.

21:12.532 --> 21:13.620
[Danny]
THAT'S A LIE, OKAY?

21:13.663 --> 21:16.231
SHE'S--EVERYBODY,
SHE'S--SHE'S LYING.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.015
SHE'S LYING.
I WOULD NEVER MARRY THIS WOMAN.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.322
IT IS NOT HIS FAULT, OKAY?

21:20.366 --> 21:22.411
HE HAS A DISEASE.

21:22.455 --> 21:24.457
BUT HE'S A GOOD GUY, OKAY?

21:24.500 --> 21:26.589
SHOW'S OVER, EVERYBODY. JUST LEAVE US ALONE.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.635
[Danny] YEAH, COME ON, GIVE US SOME PRIVACY NOW.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.247
