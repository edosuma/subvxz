00:01.760 --> 00:05.480
(theme music playing)

01:11.400 --> 01:13.840
(mechanical whirring)

01:19.440 --> 01:21.000
Yes, absolutely.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.880
Two reports, spiral bind,
150 pages,

01:23.960 --> 01:26.800
I know exactly the jobs
you're referring to.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.960
The color of the bond?

01:29.040 --> 01:31.960
I have that information
right in front of me.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.360
The color is...
(laughs)

01:34.440 --> 01:36.040
-I can't read my own writing.
-Saffron.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.640
Saffron, one of the great colors.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.440
So... yeah.

01:40.520 --> 01:41.960
No problem.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.560
You, too.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.160
Goodbye.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.960
-You just saved my life.
-Yeah, right.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.840
So how did you remember saffron?

01:49.920 --> 01:53.840
Because you're eating rice.
Never mind.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.000
Anyway, wish me luck.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.200
I'll need it. I'm about to meet
with Michael Rosenfeld.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.120
Don't be silly.
You're so defeatist.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.400
Patty, Allegheny Systems
could go with any printer.

02:02.480 --> 02:05.240
Graham, you could land
this account. I can feel it.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.960
I'm glad one of us does, stop.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.120
What did I come in here for?

02:10.200 --> 02:12.320
The estimates to bring with you.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.040
Where are they? I hate it
when you get negative...

02:16.120 --> 02:18.880
-(telephone rings)
-...like this before a meeting.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.880
(rings)

02:20.960 --> 02:23.480
Hello. Wood &amp; Jones Printing.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.840
(tense music playing)

02:56.760 --> 03:00.920
(whispering)

03:19.680 --> 03:22.480
What?
Ah! Shh. No talking.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.600
-(Lerner) Eyes on your own paper.
-Wait a minute.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.400
Angela.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.800
-Sit down.
-That's my father.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.680
(whispering)

03:41.840 --> 03:43.560
I'll be right back.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.000
Sharon's dad had a heart attack.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.640
Oh, God.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.440
(Graham) I'm going to take her
straight to the hospital.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.800
You know what might help?

03:55.960 --> 03:56.960
Angela?

03:57.040 --> 03:58.200
What?

03:58.280 --> 04:00.240
If you went straight
to Sharon's after school.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.760
Your mom might appreciate that.
She's going to be there.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.400
You know where they keep
the spare key?

04:07.480 --> 04:09.240
Under the planter.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.800
Okay.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.240
I got to go.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.640
We should go. Okay.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.440
-(footsteps)
-(Patty sighs)

04:33.520 --> 04:35.520
I did their dishes.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.600
I'm just going to grab Camille
a sweater and stuff.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.840
She may have to
spend the night there.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.560
(Angela) <i>When I was little,</i>
<i>I practically lived at Sharon's house,</i>

04:54.640 --> 04:56.840
<i>and Sharon's room was like...</i>

04:58.280 --> 04:59.680
<i>our world.</i>

05:04.920 --> 05:08.040
(music box plays)

05:11.440 --> 05:12.600
They spelled your name wrong.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.360
Can I have some?

05:15.440 --> 05:19.320
-You'll get my germs.
-I don't care. I want my tonsils out, too.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.760
-No.
-Why not?

05:21.840 --> 05:22.920
'Cause it hurts.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.280
Squeeze my hand as hard
as it hurts.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.400
-Why?
-So I know how much it hurts.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.760
-Ow.
-(both laugh)

05:31.840 --> 05:33.520
(Patty) Angela.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.920
Listen. I think I'd better go on
to the hospital without you.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.880
-I need you at home with Danielle.
-Sure. Whatever you want.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.600
Dad's at the hospital with Sharon?

05:43.680 --> 05:47.320
Yeah. Don't worry.
I'll send her your love.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.120
Okay. Thank you.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.240
(machine beeps)

05:57.160 --> 05:58.240
-What?
-Nothing.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.280
They just keep saying the same things.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.560
-I'm going to try Kyle again.
-Okay., honey.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.080
-The boyfriend.
-All right. Good.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.400
I mean, that she has someone.

06:08.480 --> 06:13.120
-Is there anything else I can do?
-Oh, man. I just...

06:13.200 --> 06:17.600
I'm thinking these slow,
kind of underwater thoughts

06:17.680 --> 06:21.360
like I got to call his sister,

06:21.440 --> 06:24.320
but she always asks these
really disturbing questions.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.000
(voice fades)

06:27.080 --> 06:30.280
-It just hasn't hit me yet.
-I'm sorry. What?

06:30.360 --> 06:33.280
Are you hungry?
Would you like something to eat?

06:34.280 --> 06:36.280
Heart disease,
does it run in Andy's family?

06:36.360 --> 06:39.640
No, mm-mm, nothing like that.
It's weird, isn't it?

06:39.720 --> 06:43.080
Seeing him lying there on television.
I didn't even know they did that.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.240
Oh, honey, your hand is shaking.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.600
Why do I feel so normal?

06:50.360 --> 06:54.440
-It just hasn't hit me yet.
-I just have to make one phone call.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.920
(clicks tongue)

07:03.200 --> 07:05.120
-Camille.
-Oh, honey.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.640
Oh, it's okay.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.160
Why am I crying?
He's going to be fine.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.840
What did they say? Is there
any news? Where's Graham?

07:13.920 --> 07:15.640
Phone call. No, there's no news.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.680
I mean, they just, I mean,
they tried to run a test or something,

07:18.760 --> 07:21.440
but he's too unstable,
whatever that means.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.920
Oh, honey, it's okay, really.
They gave him some Xanax.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Now we just need to give you some.

07:29.760 --> 07:33.360
Here's your stuff.
I put some magazines in there.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.720
I didn't know which toothbrush,
so I brought both.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.440
I'll put these somewhere.
I'll be right back.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.640
I was calling Allegheny Systems
to reschedule.

07:44.720 --> 07:48.520
Oh, great. Oh, God, Graham.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.040
-He's exactly my age.
-I know.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.440
-We're like eight months apart.
-I know.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.320
It's terrifying.
It just can't be happening.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.080
-People our age don't have heart attacks.
-I know.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.840
-You know.
-It's a nightmare.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.600
So did you call Rosenfeld
for another appointment?

08:01.680 --> 08:02.960
Andy Cherski.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.720
My God, Andy Cherski.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.480
I've never seen Andy Cherski sneeze.
He's healthy.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.360
He's always telling me
to quit eating butter.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.600
(sniffs)

08:16.040 --> 08:17.720
Yeah, I'm seeing Rosenfeld tomorrow.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.080
Oh, sweetheart.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.360
Are you okay?

08:23.440 --> 08:25.880
I guess,
except my boyfriend's missing.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.840
He's going to be fine, your dad.

08:28.920 --> 08:31.640
-Angela sends her love. By the way.
-Okay.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.200
Camille, how can we help?
Let us help.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.880
-I don't know.
-Let us take Sharon home with us.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.080
-What?
-It's not a bad idea.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.360
If your mom gonna stay here.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.040
-Uh, Mom, can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure, hon. What?

08:44.120 --> 08:45.880
I can stay home alone by myself.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.400
You know what,
why don't you let them take you home?

08:48.480 --> 08:50.120
I mean, they're just trying
to help. Okay, honey.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.240
-I know.
-I'm going to be fine here, you know?

08:52.320 --> 08:54.360
-Okay, okay.
-I really am. You know that, right?

08:54.440 --> 08:57.520
-Are you okay?
-No, yes, I'm fine. Okay.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.520
All right, sweetie.

09:00.400 --> 09:04.200
Great.
So, I'll telephone you later, okay?

09:04.280 --> 09:06.960
I should stay here
in case Camille needs me.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.560
Oh, right.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.600
-Ready?
-Yeah.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.320
Is Sharon's dad going to die?

09:21.400 --> 09:22.880
How would I know?

09:24.240 --> 09:25.360
How old is he?

09:26.600 --> 09:29.280
The same age as dad.
They're all like the same age.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.240
-If dad dies...
-Danielle.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.520
Mom says it's nothing.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.240
She talks to me like I'm 5.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.440
(sighs)
Mom talks to everyone like that.

09:40.520 --> 09:43.040
If dad did die,
who'd give me away?

09:43.120 --> 09:44.520
What?

09:44.600 --> 09:46.000
Who'd give me away
at my wedding?

09:46.600 --> 09:48.760
-You're so weird.
-Why?

09:50.080 --> 09:51.760
Because who's going to marry you?

09:51.840 --> 09:53.560
(laughing)

09:55.480 --> 09:56.640
Hi.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.720
Daddy, you're home!

10:00.880 --> 10:02.720
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.120
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.600
(Graham) Has anyone eaten?

10:10.680 --> 10:13.360
I'm not hungry.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.680
-Yeah, me neither.
-Me neither.

10:15.760 --> 10:20.320
(Angela) <i>I felt like a really shallow</i>
<i>person because I was hungry.</i>

10:20.400 --> 10:22.320
I'd better put these away.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.480
Well, I guess I'll go to bed.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.400
I mean, I feel really tired.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.000
(Angela)<i> I wanted to hug Sharon</i>

10:45.080 --> 10:49.360
<i>and tell her things like how awful I felt</i>

10:49.440 --> 10:53.920
<i>but it was like I didn't have the right</i>

10:54.000 --> 10:56.560
<i>because we weren't friends anymore.</i>

10:56.640 --> 10:58.880
You can have the bed.
I'll sleep on this.

10:58.960 --> 11:02.160
-No. I can sleep on the floor.
-No, take the bed. You're the guest.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.960
Hold on. I'll get you a better pillow.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.520
(soft music playing)

11:28.760 --> 11:32.120
This pillow's better. The other one,
my baby cousin once peed on it.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.520
Sharon?

11:52.320 --> 11:53.800
(Graham whispering) How's Andy?

11:53.880 --> 11:55.520
Any change?

11:55.600 --> 11:57.320
He's still having
those extra heartbeats,

11:57.400 --> 12:01.160
and they still don't know why
or if he's going to need that...

12:01.240 --> 12:04.000
-The operation with the balloon.
-Angioplasty.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.720
But he's going to pull through,
right?

12:06.800 --> 12:07.800
They don't know.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.440
What kind of cereal was that
you bought?

12:10.520 --> 12:12.920
And why'd you buy all that buttermilk?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.240
I bought buttermilk?

12:15.320 --> 12:16.920
I got those estimates downstairs.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.440
Don't forget to take them
to your meeting with Rosenfeld.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.160
(Danielle) Help!
This buttermilk is stuck in my throat!

12:27.440 --> 12:28.680
Angela...

12:30.480 --> 12:33.320
Listen, I know you and Sharon
haven't been on the best terms,

12:33.400 --> 12:35.680
but I want you to make an effort...

12:35.760 --> 12:37.520
Mom, I'm not a child.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.520
I understand.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.080
Look at her. Poor kid.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.640
I'll drive her to school later.
You better get a move on, though.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.440
Honey...

12:51.440 --> 12:52.480
How are you feeling?

12:53.680 --> 12:55.000
Okay.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.440
Look.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.200
We saved you a muffin.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.480
-Right?
-Yeah.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.080
(dog barking)

13:09.040 --> 13:10.560
(birds chirping)

13:12.000 --> 13:14.880
(bell rings)

13:18.440 --> 13:20.320
Look, I said I was sorry.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.600
(Sharon)
I left five messages for you, Kyle, five.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.000
I mean, my father is in the...

13:27.200 --> 13:28.400
I mean...

13:30.640 --> 13:32.240
I need you.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.160
Right. So...

13:35.520 --> 13:39.400
I've got to create a circuit for shop,
so...

13:39.480 --> 13:42.840
-I'll call you later, okay.?
-Kyle.

13:43.480 --> 13:47.920
(door opens and closes)

13:48.000 --> 13:51.640
(crying)

13:51.720 --> 13:54.640
(crash)

13:54.720 --> 13:56.400
Look, I didn't hear
anything just now, okay.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.240
So, I mean...

13:58.320 --> 14:03.840
I heard you're having a conversation,
so I just basically tuned it out.

14:03.920 --> 14:07.240
I'm able to do that,
not hear a thing, so...

14:09.960 --> 14:12.560
(crying)

14:24.200 --> 14:25.840
Ooh.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.360
Comparing instruments?

14:28.640 --> 14:29.840
(laughs)

14:30.440 --> 14:31.840
She is such an idiot.

14:33.480 --> 14:37.000
You wouldn't believe some
of the things that girl's said to me.

14:37.080 --> 14:41.320
That was so stupid of me,
crying.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.080
No, that's okay. I mean...

14:47.200 --> 14:49.320
Well, see you later.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.280
See you on the bus.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.800
You're taking my bus?

14:58.880 --> 15:01.440
Yeah, 'cause I'm staying
at Angela's.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.360
-What?
-(Brian) Oh.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.960
So, I heard about your dad.
Tough break.

15:13.440 --> 15:16.280
So, girl in distress hurls herself
on guy with no life, huh?

15:18.720 --> 15:20.200
It's probably
just a figure of speech.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.800
See you on the bus, I mean, she probably
doesn't mean she'll actually see me.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.480
She's just being polite.
She means, yeah,

15:25.560 --> 15:28.280
we'll be on the same bus,
but not like together.

15:28.360 --> 15:33.240
-So, you're staying at Angela's house?
-Yeah. What do you care?

15:33.320 --> 15:38.480
I don't. So, is her dad cooking you up
all kinds of good food or something?

15:38.560 --> 15:40.000
What about, you know, Kyle?

15:40.080 --> 15:42.880
I mean, they've been umbilically-attached
for like a month.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.720
Kyle was probably her
popular-jock phase.

15:45.800 --> 15:49.280
Now she's moving into her
awkward-but-sensitive-guy phase, you know.

15:49.360 --> 15:52.360
-So, you're saying I'm someone's phase?
-Hey, I wish I was.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.840
Oh, well, lucky you,
living with the Chases.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.920
Yeah. Whoop-de-do.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.160
Hey, look,
if you guys are friends again,

16:00.240 --> 16:03.680
you don't have to conceal it
or anything. I can take it.

16:05.520 --> 16:08.440
-(Camille) You see that nurse right there?
-(Patty) Mm-hm.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.600
She blames me.

16:10.680 --> 16:15.840
She thinks that I brought the heart attack
on by my sexual demands.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.360
(laughing)

16:19.520 --> 16:21.600
No, actually, my sexual commands.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.240
(both laugh)

16:25.760 --> 16:27.880
What is there, good news?

16:29.200 --> 16:30.960
What makes you think that?

16:32.320 --> 16:35.520
Actually,
Andy is pretty much the same.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.520
-But I thought that...
-I was going to Allegheny Systems

16:40.600 --> 16:43.480
-and realized I forgot the estimates.
-You forgot the estimates.

16:43.560 --> 16:46.560
-Here.
-I can't believe I did this.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.120
Anyway... Wait. Here. Here.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.840
Oh, Graham, this is beautiful.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.240
It's a lemon hazelnut torte.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.680
-Thank you.
-When did you...

16:57.760 --> 17:00.000
I couldn't sleep,
I was up waiting for you.

17:00.080 --> 17:03.120
Oh, my God, Patty.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.120
You waited up for me?
I mean, I thought...

17:05.200 --> 17:06.440
Only till three.

17:06.520 --> 17:10.120
(clicks tongue) Well, I guess
I'm going to be late for this meeting.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.240
I'd better phone them.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.400
-Your husband is an artist.
-Oh, God.

17:18.480 --> 17:22.880
I can't bear it.
He's just sabotaging himself.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.000
He's sabotaging this account
that would mean so much to us,

17:26.080 --> 17:28.360
and I can't even say anything.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.400
Oh, my God, Patty, what, what...

17:30.480 --> 17:31.600
-What?
-What would I do?

17:31.680 --> 17:34.520
I mean, how would I survive?

17:34.600 --> 17:37.720
Camille, it's okay, honey.
You're going to be okay.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.560
No. You don't understand.
I need him. I'm not like you.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.720
What? Wait. What am I like?

17:43.800 --> 17:45.720
I didn't mean that.
I just mean I need him.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.320
I really need Andy to live.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.400
This is incredible.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.480
(elevator dings)

17:54.560 --> 17:57.240
Right, I'm sorry, but I...

18:04.280 --> 18:06.640
(laugh)

18:08.440 --> 18:11.200
Oh, hi.

18:15.680 --> 18:16.840
We can go downstairs.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.280
No, it's fine. I was just...

18:20.400 --> 18:21.600
I should probably go.

18:21.680 --> 18:25.520
No. No, no, don't go.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.320
So your room is...

18:30.400 --> 18:31.840
A mess.

18:31.920 --> 18:35.160
Different from the last time
I saw it.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.720
Okay, well, I'm going.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.800
(door closes)

18:53.280 --> 18:55.000
(both laugh)

19:28.760 --> 19:30.040
I'm on hold.

20:25.480 --> 20:26.960
Rosenfeld...

20:28.000 --> 20:29.400
I got to call him back.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.520
(theme music playing)

21:28.680 --> 21:32.120
(dramatic music playing)

21:53.840 --> 21:55.440
Good morning.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.480
How long have you been up?

22:08.840 --> 22:09.960
A while.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.880
You can have the first shower
if you want.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.120
That's okay. You go ahead.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.600
There's, like,
nothing edible in here.

22:25.680 --> 22:26.920
Don't be ridiculous, sweetie.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.760
That thing's crammed
full of stuff. Let me look.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.000
There's, like, nothing edible in here.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.320
So, um, do you want...

22:41.400 --> 22:42.600
Where's Angela?

22:42.680 --> 22:44.440
She left early.

22:44.520 --> 22:47.040
She must've had her reasons
or whatever.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.040
Okay, um...

22:50.120 --> 22:52.520
Well, do you want me
to bring you to the hospital,

22:52.600 --> 22:54.440
or do you just want to
go to school?

22:54.520 --> 22:56.720
-Oh, well, I...
-It's whatever you want, sweetie.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.200
Your mom says that it's up to you.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.840
I guess...

23:00.920 --> 23:02.280
I guess school.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.160
-You rescheduled with Rosenfeld, right?
-Uh-huh.

23:07.240 --> 23:10.160
And you've got the estimates,
right?

23:10.240 --> 23:11.480
I got 'em, yeah.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.800
(door opens and closes)

23:21.000 --> 23:23.920
(crying)

23:35.800 --> 23:36.800
Hey.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.360
-(toilet flushes)
-Who's in there? What happened?

23:42.080 --> 23:44.080
Nothing happened.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.360
I'm fine.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.400
Stop looking at me.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.920
Stop looking at me.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.120
What are you doing here anyway?

23:58.800 --> 24:00.760
You are playing this all wrong.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.520
What are you talking about?

24:03.600 --> 24:07.720
Please. Your dad's,
like, seriously sick, right?

24:07.800 --> 24:09.520
You shouldn't even be here.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.120
People are feeling sorry for you,
right?

24:12.360 --> 24:13.760
Use it.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.240
Take advantage.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.240
-You're saying...
-I'm saying...

24:18.920 --> 24:22.320
you have a personal tragedy
with a loved one.

24:22.400 --> 24:25.920
You shouldn't be
stuck in some stall, ballin'.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.960
I mean, isn't there
someplace else you'd rather be?

24:30.360 --> 24:33.640
-With my mom, but...
-Where's she at?

24:34.240 --> 24:37.040
At the hospital with him.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.080
But it's...

24:40.280 --> 24:42.840
it's kind of upsetting there.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.120
You should be there.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.200
I know but...

24:47.280 --> 24:51.120
-(door opens)
-Angeleeka, oh, my God.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.600
We have to go with Sharon
to the hospital.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.080
I'll get Tino to drive us.
He loves hospitals.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.840
And then Rickie will come too.
The four of us.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.360
Right? Come on.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.760
I have really been cutting bio,
like, a lot.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.360
-So...
-I don't know.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.840
I should probably
skip the hospital.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.120
(bell rings)

25:13.200 --> 25:15.880
So, I'll see you later.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.440
(indistinct chatter)

25:54.960 --> 25:56.080
Hey.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.320
Is this where you come to smoke?

26:02.280 --> 26:03.600
(Angela)<i> I'm always doing that.</i>

26:03.680 --> 26:07.400
<i>I'm always asking questions</i>
<i>I already know the answer to.</i>

26:08.520 --> 26:09.800
Uh-huh.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.560
So, are you crying or something?

26:15.160 --> 26:16.720
I guess.

26:21.560 --> 26:22.560
How come?

26:22.640 --> 26:27.080
(Angela)<i> Because I'm lonely,</i>
<i>because I have no friends,</i>

26:27.160 --> 26:30.000
<i>because I'm a terrible, terrible person.</i>

26:30.080 --> 26:32.960
Because my friend's father
is in the hospital.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.560
And he could die.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.160
(banging on fence)

27:09.360 --> 27:11.240
That's, that's rough.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.280
I better go.

27:31.600 --> 27:35.280
(bell rings)

27:41.920 --> 27:43.360
Is Sharon here?

27:43.440 --> 27:44.560
Yeah, and so is dad.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.800
But he's upstairs lying down.
He said not to disturb him.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.960
He said we should
send out for some pizza, right?

27:50.040 --> 27:52.000
And, of course.
He didn't give me any money.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.600
He's trying to starve us.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.000
Danielle,
he's just upset, you know,

27:56.080 --> 27:59.040
about Mr. Cherski and everything.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.360
-Go get your money box.
-No way.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.880
Just lay it out.
Dad will pay you back later.

28:03.960 --> 28:05.720
-You lay it out.
-I don't have any money.

28:05.800 --> 28:06.880
Is there anything to eat?

28:08.840 --> 28:10.160
We're sending out for pizza.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.520
So how, how's your dad doing?

28:13.600 --> 28:14.800
How much money do you have?

28:14.880 --> 28:17.640
None. I'm seriously hungry.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.240
(doorbell rings)

28:26.640 --> 28:28.880
Hi. Is Sharon still here?

28:28.960 --> 28:31.480
Oh, good. I mean...

28:31.560 --> 28:33.920
-Hi.
-I don't believe this.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.040
-Believe it.
-Hey, let Brian pay.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.440
-Danielle.
-(Brian) I don't mind.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.400
-Pay for what?
-Yeah. Why not?

28:39.480 --> 28:42.360
I mean, maybe he doesn't mind
paying for it.

28:42.440 --> 28:43.640
We're sending for pizza.

28:43.720 --> 28:46.120
Wow. I mean, good.

28:46.200 --> 28:48.080
I do have plenty cash on me.
It's no problem.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.120
-What's no problem?
-We were going to send for pizza.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.600
Oh, thank goodness.

28:53.680 --> 28:57.040
-I'm famished.
-I forgot to have lunch today.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.440
(Patty) Make sure you get double cheese.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.640
Oh, and get some of those
little tomatoes that daddy likes.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.360
(Danielle)
Daddy can't be disturbed.

29:04.440 --> 29:07.040
-What?
-He's lying down upstairs.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.720
Here. Get a large.

29:17.720 --> 29:20.320
(insects chirping)

29:32.240 --> 29:33.320
(sighs)

29:33.400 --> 29:34.800
Graham?

29:35.800 --> 29:38.360
What happened? Is it Andy?

29:39.480 --> 29:41.040
Nothing happened.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.400
Do, do you feel all right?
Are you coming down...

29:46.480 --> 29:49.080
I... I just want to lie here.

29:51.040 --> 29:54.520
How was your meeting with Rosenfeld?

29:55.520 --> 29:56.600
(sighs)

29:56.680 --> 29:57.760
It went okay.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.760
Did you feel like you made
all your points?

30:00.840 --> 30:02.360
Look, I...

30:03.960 --> 30:06.560
I want to tell you, and I will
tell you how the meeting went,

30:06.640 --> 30:09.720
but I really just can't talk about it now.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.840
-Okay?
-(chuckles)

30:12.920 --> 30:14.800
You know it's okay. I mean...

30:16.240 --> 30:20.600
We'll live. You know? I mean,
we don't have to have this account.

30:20.680 --> 30:21.800
I mean,
the important thing is...

30:21.880 --> 30:24.520
I'm really sorry.
I have to get out of here.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.960
-What?
-I can't breathe.

30:27.040 --> 30:30.280
Graham, if you didn't
land this account, that's...

30:30.360 --> 30:33.440
Please. Just let it be.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.880
Okay?

30:37.960 --> 30:39.920
-I can't...
-What?

30:40.000 --> 30:43.280
You... You can't what?
What is wrong?

30:43.360 --> 30:44.840
(sighs)

30:44.920 --> 30:47.160
-Where are you going?
-I'm sorry.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.320
I have to get out of this house.

31:05.960 --> 31:06.960
(car door shuts)

31:07.040 --> 31:08.640
(car drives away)

31:10.720 --> 31:12.360
They say it'll be here in 20 minutes.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.520
Great.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.720
(telephone rings)

31:20.480 --> 31:21.640
Hello?

31:24.160 --> 31:25.040
Yeah.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.200
Hold on a second.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.280
It's for you.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.840
Hello?

31:40.920 --> 31:44.240
Oh, Kyle, thank God, it's you.

31:44.320 --> 31:48.960
You know, I'm sort of not
really that hungry for pizza,

31:49.040 --> 31:51.320
-now that I think about it.
-Oh, okay. Great.

31:51.400 --> 31:55.560
Yeah, I'll be ready. Bye. Bye.

31:56.840 --> 31:58.120
Nice.

31:59.680 --> 32:00.920
What?

32:02.200 --> 32:03.680
You just made a date with Kyle?

32:03.760 --> 32:05.840
Yeah, not that
it's any of your business.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.840
I don't believe you.
What about Brian?

32:07.920 --> 32:12.000
Angela, Kyle is my boyfriend,
I hate to tell you.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.640
Brian Krakow happens to be
waiting in my living room,

32:17.720 --> 32:19.200
and I don't know
what you're doing with him.

32:19.280 --> 32:22.360
Nothing. Nothing.
We're just, we're just friends.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.000
When Kyle's not around
and you just using him.

32:25.080 --> 32:28.240
You are lecturing me
about using Brian Krakow

32:28.320 --> 32:31.160
when he is, like, so obviously in love
with you, and you totally use him.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.440
Brian's not in love with me.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.720
That's not what Rayanne Graff
says.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.040
You know what, just don't even
speak to me, okay.?

32:40.120 --> 32:44.520
I can't believe you can't even
be nice to me, at a time like this.

32:44.600 --> 32:47.920
Why do you need me to since
everybody else in the world is?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.160
(door opens)

32:53.080 --> 32:55.760
(door opens and closes)

33:01.440 --> 33:04.440
Graham? Is that you?

33:08.200 --> 33:10.640
They said the pizza
will be here in, um...

33:11.760 --> 33:13.320
20 minutes.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.160
Oh.

33:16.760 --> 33:17.760
I'm not hungry.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.280
(telephone ring)

33:34.440 --> 33:36.840
-Graham?
-No, it's me.

33:36.920 --> 33:40.520
-I'm just calling to thank you.
-Thank me?

33:40.600 --> 33:41.600
For what?

33:41.680 --> 33:43.480
For sending Graham over here.

33:43.560 --> 33:46.800
I don't know how you knew.
He's exactly who I needed.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.320
Well, good, um...

33:52.560 --> 33:54.960
How's it, how's it going?
How, how is Andy?

33:55.040 --> 33:56.720
Well, we don't, you know...

33:56.800 --> 34:00.000
We're still waiting to hear
if the angioplasty worked.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.600
Oh, and by the way. I hope
you understand about Sharon.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.080
Sharon?

34:04.160 --> 34:05.040
(Camille) <i>You know,</i>

34:05.120 --> 34:08.360
<i>she really felt like she needed to spend</i>
<i>the night in her own bed.</i>

34:08.440 --> 34:09.920
Sure. Of course.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.440
Patty, you're the greatest friend.

34:13.520 --> 34:16.200
-<i>Go back to sleep.</i>
-Okay.

34:24.720 --> 34:28.760
Here. Now, you prefer your coffee
at least two days old, right?

34:28.840 --> 34:30.280
I insist upon it.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.120
You've been amazing through all this.

34:35.200 --> 34:37.240
No. I just don't think it's hit me yet.

34:38.800 --> 34:42.720
So Andy, was he working really hard
or something?

34:43.920 --> 34:44.800
Why do you think...

34:44.880 --> 34:46.720
Why do I think he had a heart attack
at 40?

34:47.800 --> 34:50.760
Sweetie, I don't know.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.400
But he does work too hard.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.320
Actually, his new boss
is always telling him,

34:54.400 --> 34:56.560
"Go easier on yourself."

34:56.640 --> 34:59.160
The lumber business
is very unpredictable.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.480
I kept telling him
he should take some time off.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.880
But the truth of it is, he loves it.

35:05.960 --> 35:08.480
He loves his work. It's his life.

35:08.560 --> 35:11.560
It must be great to feel that way.

35:11.640 --> 35:12.800
Mrs. Cherski.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.560
-Good news.
-(door closes)

35:15.640 --> 35:17.480
The angioplasty was
a complete success.

35:17.560 --> 35:18.800
Oh, God.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.680
There was a small blockage
that we were able to clear.

35:20.760 --> 35:22.440
That's what was causing
the arrhythmia.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.920
I've prescribed a few
medications he'll need to take.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.240
But he's going to be just fine.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.480
(crying)

35:28.560 --> 35:32.160
I think... I think it finally hit me.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.160
(Graham) Thank you.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.680
(dog barking)

36:11.040 --> 36:12.640
Andy's going to be okay.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.240
Thank God.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.280
I landed the account.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.640
I don't understand. I th...

36:31.720 --> 36:33.760
When they told me, I don't know,
it was like...

36:35.160 --> 36:37.440
this moment,
because I had to admit that...

36:38.960 --> 36:40.680
I didn't want to land it.

36:42.960 --> 36:46.880
Because landing it means that...
I'm really doing this.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.840
And this is my job.
This is my life.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.920
This is it.
This is what I really...

36:59.920 --> 37:01.560
but...

37:01.640 --> 37:03.200
Look, I'm sorry
that I couldn't...

37:03.280 --> 37:05.280
-Oh, no.
-You know, handle it or whatever.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.400
It's okay.

37:06.480 --> 37:09.280
But, look, I landed it, right?

37:13.080 --> 37:14.520
It's all that matters.

37:24.680 --> 37:26.360
I don't think so.

37:28.840 --> 37:31.200
I don't think
that's all that matters.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.240
Say what you mean.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.920
I'm proud of you.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.920
I'm glad you landed the account.

37:45.520 --> 37:46.920
And you're fired.

37:48.280 --> 37:49.160
What?

37:50.760 --> 37:52.080
You're fired.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.120
Because I love you.

37:57.320 --> 37:59.640
Because I don't want to lose you.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.440
No.

38:05.520 --> 38:08.320
No, Patty, it's okay.
I can face my responsibilities.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.640
I know. I...

38:10.720 --> 38:11.960
But you're not happy.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.920
You're not. You're...

38:16.000 --> 38:17.080
(sighs)

38:18.000 --> 38:20.160
Something has to change.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.640
-What do we do? I mean...
-I don't know.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.720
-What'll I do? I don't even...
-I don't know what you're going to do.

38:31.400 --> 38:34.080
I guess you're finally
going to figure it out.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.800
(breaths deeply)

38:58.040 --> 38:59.360
(sighs)

39:00.280 --> 39:03.560
(bell rings)

39:06.560 --> 39:09.240
You know that girl Angela Chase?

39:09.320 --> 39:11.280
-That red-headed girl?
-Yeah, some redhead.

39:11.360 --> 39:12.960
It's out of a bottle.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.760
-Anyway, is she avoiding us?
-I think she is.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.800
I think we make her
physically ill or something.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.800
I think so because...

39:19.880 --> 39:21.160
Oh, Angela.

39:21.240 --> 39:24.400
-Hi.
-Very funny.

39:24.480 --> 39:25.720
So I guess you've heard.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.680
Sharon's dad's okay.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.840
That's great.
No, I hadn't heard. I'm...

39:30.920 --> 39:33.600
Obviously, the last person
in Pittsburgh to hear.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.840
So, you're friends
with Sharon now?

39:37.920 --> 39:39.720
Well, so... you are, right?

39:41.880 --> 39:45.360
Look, we all know
what's going on. Okay?

39:45.440 --> 39:47.600
-Which is that, you are jealous.
-What?

39:47.680 --> 39:50.040
And you, you are totally flipped

39:50.120 --> 39:52.640
because Rayanne finally did
something nice for once in her life.

39:52.720 --> 39:53.640
Hey.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.480
Which she did by taking
Sharon to go visit her dad.

39:55.560 --> 39:59.240
Both of you want to be sure
you're still friends, which you are.

39:59.320 --> 40:00.240
So shut up!

40:00.320 --> 40:02.360
(laughs)

40:02.440 --> 40:03.920
Let's kill him.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.920
(Rayanne) Say your prayers,
Vasquez.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.200
(knocking on door)

40:17.080 --> 40:18.440
I've been knocking, but...

40:19.200 --> 40:20.040
What?

40:21.160 --> 40:23.040
I... Your mom let me in.

40:23.120 --> 40:26.520
I came to drop off your bag.

40:28.120 --> 40:31.080
-What are you listening to?
-A group you probably hate.

40:32.440 --> 40:34.640
Well, okay. I'll go. Just...

40:37.480 --> 40:39.360
I'm glad
your dad's going to be okay.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.160
My father almost died.

40:48.920 --> 40:53.120
And you were the only person
who didn't even seem to care.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.520
People I barely knew were...

40:57.640 --> 41:00.520
were coming up to me all like,
concerned...

41:02.440 --> 41:03.240
and...

41:04.560 --> 41:07.080
you acted like
you barely even knew me.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.880
I know.
I know I acted like that.

41:12.840 --> 41:14.720
I just didn't know
what else to do.

41:14.800 --> 41:18.480
I knew I was the last person on
Earth you wanted to deal with.

41:18.560 --> 41:24.520
You were the only person
I wanted to deal with. (crying)

41:25.120 --> 41:28.400
I wanted to talk to you, too,
it just seemed like

41:28.480 --> 41:31.720
you wanted help
from everyone but me.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.880
I was really scared.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.440
I was, too.

41:49.040 --> 41:49.840
I know...

41:51.040 --> 41:53.920
I know we have
different friends now...

41:55.400 --> 41:58.440
but sometimes
I miss you so much.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.320
Me, too.

42:02.920 --> 42:06.560
It, it really hurts.

42:12.160 --> 42:15.120
Squeeze my hand
as hard as it hurts.

42:28.200 --> 42:29.680
Oh.

42:59.520 --> 43:00.440
You're in my light.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.520
So Sharon's dad
is going to be okay.

43:08.600 --> 43:10.880
I heard.
Your friend, Rickie, told me.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.880
I was just over there at Sharon's.

43:15.920 --> 43:17.960
I ended up staying
a pretty long time.

43:18.040 --> 43:20.880
Is there some reason you think
I should care about this?

43:20.960 --> 43:22.760
I don't know.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.360
You two were friends.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.400
I guess.

43:31.080 --> 43:32.880
I mean, we're not,
like, really friends.

43:32.960 --> 43:34.320
But you've been
hanging out with her?

43:34.400 --> 43:35.760
(sighs)

43:36.360 --> 43:37.640
Look...

43:40.960 --> 43:42.280
It was just...

43:43.400 --> 43:44.840
She needed me.

43:44.920 --> 43:49.320
I mean, not me,
but somebody, anybody.

43:49.400 --> 43:51.880
And I just happened to be there,
and we just...

43:52.880 --> 43:55.040
So we just, like, hung out.

43:55.120 --> 43:56.640
Or whatever.

43:56.720 --> 43:58.120
I mean, it could've been anyone.

43:59.520 --> 44:01.800
No, that's not true.

44:02.400 --> 44:04.320
It doesn't work
with just anyone.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.000
I mean, some people...

44:10.200 --> 44:12.280
I mean, I think she needed you.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.400
Why?

44:18.400 --> 44:20.480
Because of certain ways...

44:22.400 --> 44:23.840
that you are.

44:25.360 --> 44:28.120
(dog barking)

44:31.800 --> 44:33.120
What, did you...

44:34.600 --> 44:37.120
like, give this thought
or something?

44:37.720 --> 44:40.000
(laughs)
Brian, go inflate your tire.

44:49.440 --> 44:52.960
(Angela) <i>There are so many different ways</i>
<i>to be connected to people.</i>

45:03.680 --> 45:07.360
