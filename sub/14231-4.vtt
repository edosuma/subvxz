15:17.042 --> 15:19.169
They sent the wrong kit!

15:19.252 --> 15:22.672
Hmm, maybe we can paint it pink?

15:22.756 --> 15:25.008
Maybe we could paint it pink?

15:25.091 --> 15:27.260
Are you out of your pink little mind?

15:27.344 --> 15:29.596
You think anyone's stupid
enough to fall for that?
