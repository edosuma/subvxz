Fella!

Fella!

00:59.717 --> 01:02.185
- <i>Fella!</i>
- Yes!

01:05.489 --> 01:07.047
<i>Fella! Are you awake?</i>

01:07.258 --> 01:08.953
I am now, Mother.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.425
- What?
- I mean, Stepmother.

01:12.630 --> 01:14.962
That's better. Now, get to work.

01:15.166 --> 01:16.428
Bring my breakfast. Fried eggs.

Boys.

04:26.924 --> 04:28.289
Rupert, dear.

04:28.492 --> 04:30.460
Maximilian, loVe.

04:30.661 --> 04:32.993
Boys, wake up.

04:33.197 --> 04:35.961
Come, come. Wake up.

04:36.834 --> 04:40.668
- Good morning, Mother dear.
- Good morning, sweets.

04:41.872 --> 04:44.397
Good morning, Rupert.

04:44.608 --> 04:45.905
Good morning, Mother dearest.

04:46.110 --> 04:48.135
Come, son,
it's time for your breakfast.

04:50.180 --> 04:52.239
I heard some strange noises.

04:52.449 --> 04:53.780
Did you children hear anything?

04:53.984 --> 04:56.316
No, Mother, not a thing.

04:56.820 --> 04:59.948
I went to bed early,
was sleeping Very soundly.

05:00.858 --> 05:03.952
Mother's good boys.
Come on, then.

05:04.161 --> 05:05.924
It must haVe been that fool
in the kitchen.

05:06.130 --> 05:10.362
If he's broken any more dishes,
I'll take away his bicycle priVileges.

06:01.885 --> 06:03.682
Paper. A paper.

06:03.887 --> 06:06.082
Paper! All right.

06:13.831 --> 06:16.061
- Fella, Fella.
- All right!

06:54.004 --> 06:55.596
Oh, dizzy.

07:11.989 --> 07:13.513
Fella!

07:30.541 --> 07:31.769
Fella!

07:54.064 --> 07:55.292
Fella! Fella!

07:55.566 --> 07:58.399
- <i>Fella!</i>
- Yeah? Oh!

08:01.171 --> 08:02.661
<i>Fella!</i>

08:02.873 --> 08:04.306
<i>Fella!</i>

08:05.843 --> 08:07.276
Yes, Stepmother.

08:07.477 --> 08:08.705
Where's my car?

08:08.912 --> 08:10.402
Oh, I'll...

08:11.014 --> 08:13.346
I'll driVe it right around
to the front door.

08:13.550 --> 08:16.519
Well, be careful you don't dirty
my upholstery with your filthy clothes.

08:17.221 --> 08:19.553
Oh, no, I'll be careful that I won't dirty
your nice upholstery

08:19.756 --> 08:22.122
with my dirty, filthy clothes,
Stepmother.

08:53.590 --> 08:55.649
Didn't I tell you to be here
at half past 12?

08:55.859 --> 08:59.090
Oh, I'm sorry, Mother...
Stepmother, I thought you said 12:30.

08:59.296 --> 09:01.491
Can't you ever do anything
I ask you to do?

09:01.698 --> 09:04.223
Well, I try, Stepmother, I really try.

09:04.434 --> 09:07.335
You don't seem to realize
that you haVen't got a cent.

09:07.537 --> 09:10.938
Your father left everything to me.
And yet I giVe you a home,

09:11.141 --> 09:13.132
room and board,
all out of the goodness of my heart.

09:13.343 --> 09:16.506
Yes, I know you do, Stepmother.
Well...

09:16.713 --> 09:18.908
You ought to be a little more
reasonable, young man.

09:19.116 --> 09:20.981
But then I don't suppose one
can expect anything

09:21.184 --> 09:23.618
from somebody with
ordinary blood in their Veins.

09:23.820 --> 09:26.015
Well, I realize I don't haVe
the class

09:26.623 --> 09:31.026
that Maximilian and Rupert haVe,

09:31.228 --> 09:33.958
but, well, I certainly appreciate
everything that you do for me.

09:34.164 --> 09:35.529
Then try and show your appreciation

09:35.732 --> 09:37.131
by getting some work done
around here.

09:37.334 --> 09:38.562
Yes, I will, Stepmother.

09:38.769 --> 09:40.828
We're going to haVe
a Very important houseguest,

09:41.038 --> 09:42.505
and I want everything to be perfect.

09:42.706 --> 09:44.833
- You understand? Perfect.
- Oh, yes, perfect.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.306
It will be perfect. Yes.

09:47.511 --> 09:49.069
Who's it going to be, Stepmother?

09:49.279 --> 09:51.372
You'll read all about it
in the newspapers.

09:51.581 --> 09:54.641
Oh, in the newspapers. Then it must
be someone Very important. Who?

09:54.851 --> 09:56.079
And clean the pool!

09:56.286 --> 09:58.880
Yeah, clean the pool.
Yes, I will, with a rag.

09:59.089 --> 10:00.454
Enjoy your ride, Stepmother.

10:00.657 --> 10:05.754
I fixed the car perfectly, mechanically,
beautifully, so that you'd enjoy driVing.

10:05.963 --> 10:09.091
Perfectly, it's mechanically perfect.

10:09.299 --> 10:11.824
It's perfectly... It's...

10:12.035 --> 10:15.402
It's at least good enough
to get you into town.

11:13.497 --> 11:15.522
Hello there, Fella.

11:17.300 --> 11:20.269
Hello. How did you know my?

11:26.943 --> 11:29.377
Hello. How did you know
my name was Fella?

11:30.714 --> 11:32.181
It had to be Fella.

11:33.350 --> 11:34.817
You're a friend of Mother's?

11:35.018 --> 11:36.349
Your stepmother, you mean.

11:36.553 --> 11:38.646
No, I wouldn't say we were friends.

11:38.855 --> 11:40.846
Or will we ever be.

11:41.958 --> 11:45.655
Well, she inVited you to go swimming.
That was rather friendly.

11:45.862 --> 11:48.729
No, I'm afraid I inVited myself.

11:48.932 --> 11:51.264
But I'll leaVe if I bother you,
you know.

11:51.468 --> 11:53.868
Oh, not at all. You don't bother me.
On the contrary.

11:54.071 --> 11:55.936
I like to see people
enjoy themselVes.

11:56.139 --> 11:59.472
Oh, well, thank you.
I like you, Fella.

11:59.676 --> 12:01.405
We're gonna get along, you know.

12:01.611 --> 12:03.408
Well, thank you.
I like to get along.

12:03.613 --> 12:06.173
I loVe persons and people.

12:07.617 --> 12:09.744
Persons and people.

12:09.953 --> 12:11.420
There's a difference?

12:11.621 --> 12:13.919
Oh, sure, there's a big difference.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.751
You see, persons...

12:15.959 --> 12:17.756
Persons are people
who haVe made it,

12:17.961 --> 12:19.326
who are rich and famous.

12:19.529 --> 12:21.759
So that, of course,
makes them persons

12:21.965 --> 12:23.626
and they're not people anymore.

12:24.401 --> 12:26.028
I see, yes.

12:26.236 --> 12:27.464
But, but I...

12:27.671 --> 12:31.471
I like persons because I think because
I feel sorry for them, you know?

12:31.675 --> 12:35.372
Fella, you've got me worried,
you know.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.708
Someday, you might be
a Very important person.

12:38.915 --> 12:40.348
Me?

12:42.018 --> 12:43.417
Uh-uh.

12:47.858 --> 12:49.348
Yeah?

12:51.828 --> 12:54.729
<i>Let me be a people</i>

12:55.565 --> 12:57.829
<i>I don't ask for much</i>

12:58.568 --> 13:00.798
<i>Just a space</i>
<i>A happy place</i>

13:01.004 --> 13:02.938
That has the common touch.

13:03.140 --> 13:05.608
<i>I'm aware I'll never be great</i>

13:05.809 --> 13:08.676
A head of state? A potentate?
Oh, no.

13:09.980 --> 13:12.847
<i>I don't care for elegant clothes</i>

13:13.250 --> 13:16.742
<i>For goodness knows</i>
<i>My life is rosy</i>

13:17.721 --> 13:19.848
<i>Let me be a people</i>

13:20.056 --> 13:21.990
<i>I'm no V.I.P.</i>

13:22.192 --> 13:25.457
Though you'll never go bragging
about your family tree.

13:26.329 --> 13:31.665
<i>I don't wanna be anyone else</i>
<i>But plain old me</i>

13:34.404 --> 13:37.498
<i>Apple pie and the Fourth of July</i>

13:37.707 --> 13:40.141
Can really pleasure you high.

13:40.343 --> 13:43.005
<i>Simple things like community sings</i>

13:43.213 --> 13:45.477
Can bring a tear to your eye.

13:45.682 --> 13:48.947
<i>Rock 'n' roll or an afternoon stroll</i>

13:49.152 --> 13:51.552
Is all the funning you need.

13:51.755 --> 13:55.054
<i>Orangeade and a circus parade</i>

13:55.258 --> 13:57.954
And you'll be hitting your speed.

13:58.161 --> 13:59.822
Oh, my.

14:00.397 --> 14:03.889
<i>I keep stating it</i>
<i>No debating it</i>

14:04.100 --> 14:06.034
<i>I'm a happy breed</i>

14:06.236 --> 14:08.864
<i>So therefore</i>

14:09.172 --> 14:11.640
<i>Let me be a people</i>

14:11.841 --> 14:14.139
<i>Says I sincerely</i>

14:14.344 --> 14:18.371
You're a fella who wouldn't care
for royalty?

14:18.582 --> 14:23.542
<i>I don't wanna be anyone else</i>
<i>But plain</i>

14:24.521 --> 14:26.113
<i>Old</i>

14:26.856 --> 14:28.084
<i>Me</i>

14:28.291 --> 14:29.226
- Just plain. I don't really...
- Well, it's like I said, Fella,

14:29.226 --> 14:31.626
- Just plain. I don't really...
- Well, it's like I said, Fella,

14:31.828 --> 14:35.696
you know, someday,
maybe you'll be a person.

14:35.899 --> 14:37.958
Why do you keep saying that?

14:38.168 --> 14:42.832
Well, all I can say is that
you and I are going to haVe a ball.

14:43.473 --> 14:46.931
A great, big, wonderful ball.

14:51.147 --> 14:53.547
You've really done it, Mother.
It'll be the affair of the season.

14:54.317 --> 14:55.784
Thank you, Rupert.

14:55.986 --> 15:00.355
It always warms a mother's heart
when her sons are proud of her.

15:06.830 --> 15:09.560
It'll cost a fortune.

15:09.766 --> 15:13.862
And you're always screaming at me
about my spending.

15:14.070 --> 15:15.833
It will be expensiVe.

15:16.039 --> 15:17.438
And as for my screaming,

15:17.641 --> 15:19.768
I never raise my Voice...

15:20.410 --> 15:22.844
...except to that lunatic
we haVe to put up with.

15:23.046 --> 15:24.877
The lunatic?

15:52.676 --> 15:54.667
Another drink, Mother?

15:55.945 --> 15:57.879
Did you complete
all your chores today?

15:58.081 --> 16:00.311
Oh, yes, I did, Mother...
Stepmother dear.

16:00.517 --> 16:03.008
EVerything except...
Excuse me, Maximilian.

16:03.219 --> 16:06.120
EVerything except pruning
the water lilies, Mother.

16:06.323 --> 16:09.156
And of course feeding the goldfish.
But I can do that after dinner.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.554
And why didn't you finish
your chores?

16:11.761 --> 16:13.786
Oh, why, Mother?
Well, you see, Stepmother,

16:13.997 --> 16:15.624
a Very odd thing happened.
Excuse me...

16:15.832 --> 16:17.857
Oh, there's a cold glass.
The ice is cold, Maximilian.

16:18.068 --> 16:20.832
Excuse me, please.
A Very odd thing happened, Mother.

16:21.037 --> 16:23.938
There you are, Rupert.
There was a strange man in our pool.

16:24.140 --> 16:26.040
In my pool.

16:26.242 --> 16:29.541
Oh, yes, dear Stepmother.

16:29.746 --> 16:31.008
In your pool.

16:31.214 --> 16:33.546
And, see, we were just standing
there and talking

16:33.750 --> 16:36.583
and all of a sudden,
he just disappeared.

16:36.786 --> 16:38.310
What do you mean,
he disappeared?

16:38.521 --> 16:40.853
Well, just like I say,
Mother... Stepmother,

16:41.057 --> 16:44.549
we were there talking
and he was just gone.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.261
And there he wasn't, and...

16:53.169 --> 16:55.501
How do we make
Corkhead here disappear?

16:55.705 --> 16:58.936
If the princess sees him, she'll think
there's insanity in the family.

16:59.142 --> 17:01.940
I beg your pardon, Rupert,
but this is true. I'm not making it up.

17:02.145 --> 17:03.578
I was standing there
and talking to him.

17:03.780 --> 17:06.977
As a matter of fact, he told me
all about the ball we're haVing here.

17:07.183 --> 17:08.650
Like in the paper here, it said that...

17:08.852 --> 17:10.752
And he said it to me before
the paper even came out.

17:10.954 --> 17:12.887
You're cracking, kid.

17:13.089 --> 17:17.048
Just like those dreams you haVe
about your old man.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.726
Oh, is that so, Mr. Smart Aleck?

17:19.929 --> 17:22.159
Well, I'll haVe you know
those dreams are true.

17:22.365 --> 17:25.425
Fella's father's always telling him
that he's rich.

17:25.635 --> 17:28.160
- Isn't he, Fella?
- Yes, Stepmother dear.

17:28.371 --> 17:30.999
Yes. Except that I always
wake up too soon.

17:31.207 --> 17:35.473
I don't think you ever woke up.
You're a spook. Beat it!

17:35.678 --> 17:37.407
Yeah, but all I...

17:38.915 --> 17:41.748
OK. I'll set the table for dinner.

17:46.823 --> 17:48.984
Mother dear, this door...

17:49.325 --> 17:52.658
...is open.
And I'll leaVe while I can.

17:56.699 --> 17:58.189
Now...

17:58.501 --> 18:00.696
...about the fortune I'm spending.

18:01.838 --> 18:03.863
<i>And now the big one.</i>

18:04.073 --> 18:07.804
<i>Count Basie's</i>
<i>great recording of "Cute".</i>

20:45.401 --> 20:47.460
Those dreams he has are true.

20:47.670 --> 20:50.901
His father's ghost is trying to tell him
where he hid his fortune.

20:51.107 --> 20:52.665
He'll be rich if he finds the money.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.672
And we'll be paupers.

20:55.178 --> 20:58.341
So you see how important it is
for Rupert to marry the princess.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.243
I see how important it is.

21:00.450 --> 21:04.819
However, I haVen't the confidence
in Rupert's charm

21:05.021 --> 21:07.114
for the opposite sex
that you haVe, Mother.

21:07.824 --> 21:10.315
I think we should ensure our chances

21:10.526 --> 21:13.051
by starting to be nice...

21:13.262 --> 21:14.661
...to the little Fella.

21:19.702 --> 21:21.499
Of course.

21:22.538 --> 21:25.029
Be nice to the little Fella.

21:30.847 --> 21:32.439
Supper's ready.

21:45.595 --> 21:47.460
Dinner's on.

21:54.103 --> 21:56.003
We're gonna eat now.

22:01.110 --> 22:03.169
It's gonna be...

22:08.351 --> 22:09.784
Food.

22:12.188 --> 22:13.655
Come on, we'll...

22:31.207 --> 22:32.731
I'm hungry.

23:45.181 --> 23:46.944
Fella...

23:57.026 --> 23:58.755
Yes, dear Stepmother?

23:58.961 --> 24:02.192
- You may serVe the wine now, Fella.
- The wine.

24:58.387 --> 25:00.321
Will there be anything else,
Stepmother?

25:00.523 --> 25:02.286
That's all, thank you.

25:21.077 --> 25:22.544
Fella...

25:32.421 --> 25:35.549
- Yes, Mother dear.
- Bring the sugar, please.

25:35.758 --> 25:37.726
Yes, Stepmother.

25:53.342 --> 25:56.175
In my coffee, Fella, please.

26:12.929 --> 26:15.420
- Will there be anything else?
- That's all. Thank you, Fella.

26:15.631 --> 26:17.360
You're welcome.

26:56.772 --> 26:59.468
Fella...

27:13.322 --> 27:15.256
Yes, Maximilian?

27:16.659 --> 27:18.149
Light me.

27:18.361 --> 27:20.420
Yeah, all right.

28:35.004 --> 28:38.997
Maybe I should light it for you,
Maximilian.

28:47.783 --> 28:49.546
Oh, there's a painful lip.

28:49.752 --> 28:52.414
Could you just pull on the lip,
please, Max? Just easy.

28:52.621 --> 28:54.953
The hurting lip. Just...

28:56.826 --> 28:59.852
It's a hole.
There's a hole in my lip and it burns.

29:00.062 --> 29:02.929
I'm tired and running
with a hole in my lip.

29:03.132 --> 29:06.624
I can't eat my soup
with a hole in the lip.

29:13.542 --> 29:15.100
I forgot to change.

29:27.490 --> 29:29.355
Shall we retire?

29:37.533 --> 29:40.661
Fella, we'll haVe our brandy
in the library.

29:41.337 --> 29:43.601
The brandy in the lib... Yes.

29:46.809 --> 29:48.572
And, Fella...

29:48.777 --> 29:50.802
...the prime rib was delicious.

29:51.147 --> 29:53.138
The prime... You loVed it?

29:54.083 --> 29:55.675
Prime rib?

29:56.986 --> 29:59.079
You loVed the prime rib?

30:02.458 --> 30:04.358
My ribs?

30:05.661 --> 30:08.858
I'm gonna faint.
Did you really loVe the prime rib?

30:09.331 --> 30:11.891
Did you? Did you?
Was it?

30:12.368 --> 30:14.996
Did you like it a lot?
Or just a little lot?

30:15.204 --> 30:16.603
Oh, I'm...

30:16.805 --> 30:21.208
Oh, I worked Very...
To my bones, fingers.

30:21.410 --> 30:25.141
I'm glad you liked my meat prime.

30:25.347 --> 30:28.180
I... Oh, thank you, oh, Mother,

30:28.384 --> 30:33.117
for enjoying my prime meat of ribs.
I'm so grateful to you all.

30:33.322 --> 30:34.846
- Fella.
- Yes?

30:35.057 --> 30:37.821
Tomorrow, I may take you
to play polo with me.

30:38.027 --> 30:39.494
Polo?

30:39.695 --> 30:41.128
Me, polo?

30:41.330 --> 30:45.323
The gentleman's game.
Oh, thank you, Maxie.

30:45.534 --> 30:48.731
Yes, and maybe you'd like to play
some tennis and golf with us.

30:48.938 --> 30:51.099
Oh, what wonderful brothers.

30:51.307 --> 30:55.403
Two swell persons to haVe as my own,
my brothers own.

30:55.611 --> 30:58.944
And Mother and brothers and all.

30:59.148 --> 31:01.480
Fella, the brandy, please.

31:01.684 --> 31:03.049
Oh, yes, Mother.

31:03.252 --> 31:04.810
I'll... Excuse me.

31:05.020 --> 31:07.454
To loVe the prime meat ribs.

31:07.656 --> 31:13.219
It's a wonder... I'm so glad that you...
I'll hope to always haVe more of this.

31:14.396 --> 31:17.126
Don't you think you're going a little
too far, playing tennis with him?

31:17.333 --> 31:19.301
And golf? And polo?

31:19.501 --> 31:22.698
I'll make him so tired
he won't be able to wake up.

31:22.905 --> 31:25.499
Then he'll finish his dream.

31:30.446 --> 31:32.914
They loVed the prime ribs.

31:34.583 --> 31:36.847
Oh, Father was so right.

31:37.052 --> 31:40.681
"LoVe, and thee shall be
loVed in return."

31:41.056 --> 31:43.149
Just like on the ring.

31:43.759 --> 31:46.626
How wise Father was.

31:47.429 --> 31:49.294
"To Fella:

31:49.498 --> 31:51.398
"LoVe thy neighbor.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.830
"LoVe him hard and well.

31:54.036 --> 31:58.666
"The loVe that you giVe will be returned
and manifested in itself

31:58.874 --> 32:02.435
"to giVe back the warmth
and the care and the affection,

32:02.645 --> 32:06.411
"as well as the hugs and the loVes
of those who haVe loVed.

32:06.615 --> 32:11.018
"To liVe and not to loVe
could be affectionate,

32:11.220 --> 32:14.451
"but yet warmth would still
maintain itself

32:14.657 --> 32:17.717
"in the loVe that you giVe to them.

32:17.926 --> 32:22.226
"Others haVe loVed in the past and
yet haVe found that they couldn't be hate.

32:22.431 --> 32:27.027
"So with loVe it is
the beneficial part of giVing.

32:27.236 --> 32:28.703
"Many children in the past haVe loVed

32:28.904 --> 32:31.839
"and yet found that they couldn't
possibly know anyone

32:32.041 --> 32:34.134
"with kissing and wisdom,
with hugging..."

32:59.034 --> 33:02.003
<i>Everybody</i>

33:03.339 --> 33:05.364
<i>Needs to care</i>

33:07.376 --> 33:09.742
<i>For somebody</i>

33:12.981 --> 33:17.645
<i>All your dreams were meant</i>
<i>To share</i>

33:18.854 --> 33:21.550
<i>With somebody</i>

33:23.926 --> 33:26.918
<i>Someone to have</i>

33:28.597 --> 33:32.431
<i>A midnight cup of tea with</i>

33:35.771 --> 33:38.171
<i>To have and hold</i>

33:38.841 --> 33:43.369
<i>And sometimes disagree with</i>

33:46.048 --> 33:49.074
<i>Oh, it's wonderful</i>

33:50.052 --> 33:55.012
<i>To live for somebody</i>

33:59.128 --> 34:03.497
<i>And the most you have to give is</i>

34:04.266 --> 34:07.064
<i>Your love</i>

34:09.237 --> 34:13.402
<i>In a cabin or a castle</i>

34:13.942 --> 34:18.072
<i>Even though you rise or fall</i>

34:21.116 --> 34:24.210
<i>Without somebody</i>

34:26.922 --> 34:29.857
<i>You're nobody</i>

34:30.659 --> 34:33.650
<i>At all</i>

34:58.771 --> 34:59.999
Where's our pigeon?

35:00.206 --> 35:02.504
He's getting dressed.
He's wearing one of my outfits.

35:03.109 --> 35:04.474
Our pigeon?

35:04.677 --> 35:07.043
Well, I hate to say this, Max,
but I think your idea will work.

35:07.247 --> 35:10.876
He'll never wake up after
the exercise I giVe him.

35:11.084 --> 35:13.609
I hope that you make out as well
with the princess.

35:13.820 --> 35:16.584
I'll try. I'm brushing up
at Arthur Murray's.

35:16.789 --> 35:18.882
Hey, Maxie, I'm dressed.

35:31.571 --> 35:32.970
Is that polo?

35:33.740 --> 35:36.675
That's the gentle...
It's not a Very gentle gentleman.

35:36.876 --> 35:40.243
I thought it was that game where
you hit the ball through that steel

35:40.446 --> 35:43.609
and it just goes.
But that's a... a high horse.

35:43.816 --> 35:49.152
I don't wanna be no gentle... game.
I don't need that.

35:51.457 --> 35:53.152
- I don't want it. I don't want it.
- Come on.

35:53.359 --> 35:55.554
I don't, no. I thought it
was another game.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.992
No, I... Well, hold it.
All right, hold it, hold it.

35:58.198 --> 35:59.426
I'll walk. I'll walk.

35:59.632 --> 36:05.229
I... I'm not ascared and I'm not
a coward, if that's the game.

36:05.438 --> 36:07.201
I'm a coward and they're high-tall.

36:07.407 --> 36:10.808
You better drag because I'll never
do it on my... I'm frightened.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.223
Has he come out again?

37:05.431 --> 37:07.899
Come out?
He could hardly drag himself in.

38:41.694 --> 38:43.093
Listen...

38:43.296 --> 38:47.494
...if we find out where the money is,
we don't tell the old lady.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.100
We keep it to ourselVes, huh?

38:50.303 --> 38:52.601
Right.

39:22.001 --> 39:23.730
<i>Here's the late news.</i>

39:23.936 --> 39:26.769
<i>As you know, the Princess Charming,</i>
<i>of the Grand Duchy of Morovia,</i>

39:26.973 --> 39:30.136
<i>is due to arrive in</i>
<i>our city on Saturday.</i>

39:30.343 --> 39:34.109
<i>But what is interesting is</i>
<i>what is behind this visit.</i>

39:34.313 --> 39:36.008
<i>There is speculation</i>
<i>in government circles</i>

39:36.215 --> 39:38.308
<i>as to the reason for the</i>
<i>princess's visit.</i>

39:38.518 --> 39:41.487
<i>The State Department states</i>
<i>it is merely a goodwill tour,</i>

39:41.687 --> 39:43.416
<i>but those closer to</i>
<i>Her Royal Highness</i>

39:43.623 --> 39:46.751
<i>claim she is here looking</i>
<i>for a suitable husband.</i>

39:46.959 --> 39:48.392
<i>If this is true,</i>

39:48.594 --> 39:50.824
<i>there's a very lucky</i>
<i>American somewhere.</i>

39:51.030 --> 39:53.726
<i>This gal is a knockout, fellas.</i>

39:54.000 --> 39:57.663
<i>And now, back to</i>
<i>marvelous meditation music.</i>

40:53.626 --> 40:58.620
Oh, hello, Father.
Where haVe you been?

40:58.998 --> 41:01.228
I was looking forward
to seeing you again.

41:01.434 --> 41:03.664
Daddy. Pop.

41:03.870 --> 41:08.569
You look Very warm.
Your whole head is all perspired.

41:09.041 --> 41:10.633
Where were you?

41:10.843 --> 41:14.973
Oh, yes, it is Very hot
down there, isn't it?

41:15.181 --> 41:18.981
I'm glad to see you again,
Father, Papa, Dad.

41:19.685 --> 41:21.050
What?

41:21.721 --> 41:23.586
Me? I am?

41:24.156 --> 41:25.748
Rich?

41:26.926 --> 41:31.522
With millions?
You mean, I'll be a wealthy millionaire?

41:32.164 --> 41:36.430
A rich wealthy.
A wealthy rich millions.

41:36.636 --> 41:39.833
Millions, and I haVe
millions and millions?

41:40.039 --> 41:41.267
That's rich to be.

41:41.474 --> 41:44.534
Millions and millions rich is good.

41:44.744 --> 41:47.838
And... And with all of that money,
then I can buy

41:48.047 --> 41:53.417
my loVely precious stepmother
a warm sweater with sequins on it.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.085
What?

41:56.989 --> 41:58.217
Yes, Daddy.

41:58.424 --> 42:00.255
You want to show me where
the money is hidden?

42:00.893 --> 42:03.521
You want me to go with you to see?

42:03.729 --> 42:05.492
Oh, all right.

42:05.698 --> 42:12.501
I want to see where all of that
millions of rich dollars are.

42:15.608 --> 42:20.773
I'll... I'll go with you, Father, because I
want to see all... All the wealthy money.

42:21.314 --> 42:24.010
That's rich dollars.

42:24.216 --> 42:27.583
To haVe millions of... What?

42:28.521 --> 42:32.685
You want me to go?
Oh, out the window.

42:32.892 --> 42:37.124
Oh, is that? Is that where
all the moneys are, Father?

42:37.330 --> 42:38.592
Oh.

42:39.165 --> 42:42.066
Well, then, I'll just go and look.

42:55.214 --> 42:58.581
Oh, all right, I will close...

43:00.553 --> 43:02.043
What, Daddy?

43:02.254 --> 43:03.721
Two?

43:04.590 --> 43:06.524
Oh, all right.

43:16.102 --> 43:19.037
This is Del Moore, ladies and
gentlemen, with the NBC mobile unit

43:19.238 --> 43:21.672
in the exclusiVe Bel Air section,
here in Los Angeles.

43:22.108 --> 43:24.872
And we're in front of the famous
Kingston estate, awaiting the arriVal

43:25.077 --> 43:27.705
of the Princess Charming,
of the Grand Duchy of MoroVia,

43:27.913 --> 43:29.471
who is due to arriVe momentarily.

43:30.049 --> 43:33.485
Now, the princess, as you know from
the newsreels and newspaper photos,

43:33.686 --> 43:36.678
is one of the most beautiful
members of European royalty.

43:36.889 --> 43:40.620
And, of course, she will be in our city
as the guest of Mrs. Roland Kingston,

43:40.826 --> 43:43.795
whose great-grandfather,
the Duke Val... Vladimir,

43:43.996 --> 43:47.124
was related to the
Archduke Maximilian Rupert Lupin

43:47.333 --> 43:50.063
of the Duchy of MoroVia.
And she'll be here for a week

43:50.269 --> 43:52.897
before starting her tour
here in the United States.

43:57.443 --> 43:59.411
Here she comes,
with a complete entourage,

43:59.612 --> 44:01.842
coming in from the airport
with the escort.

44:02.048 --> 44:04.380
And for the ladies watching,
I might mention that she's wearing

44:04.583 --> 44:07.416
the national color of periwinkle blue.

44:07.620 --> 44:10.646
A blue-gray periwinkle, actually,
which is the national color...

44:52.732 --> 44:54.927
Wowie.

44:55.134 --> 44:57.864
Is she beautiful.

44:58.070 --> 45:00.368
Indeed she is, my boy.

45:01.574 --> 45:03.337
Hello, Fella.

45:03.542 --> 45:07.069
Hello, mister.
Did you see the Princess Charming?

45:07.279 --> 45:11.477
Yes. And as you said,
she's beautiful.

45:11.684 --> 45:15.415
Yeah, huh.
Gee, I'd like to see her up close.

45:15.621 --> 45:18.522
But I can't.
They got me locked in here.

45:19.058 --> 45:21.788
They don't want her to know
that I'm any part of the family.

45:22.194 --> 45:23.718
Oh, you'll see her.

45:23.929 --> 45:25.453
No, not a chance.

45:25.664 --> 45:30.601
They hired a whole staff of help
to do the work that I do.

45:30.803 --> 45:33.237
And they locked me in this...

45:34.473 --> 45:36.168
They locked...

45:38.410 --> 45:40.503
How did you get in here?

45:41.347 --> 45:43.975
I'm a people.
I can get in anywhere.

45:44.717 --> 45:47.379
Oh, really? Like magic,
you just pop on and pop off?

45:47.586 --> 45:49.816
Just like an electric light bulb.

45:50.022 --> 45:52.115
I was talking to Thomas Edison
about that.

45:52.324 --> 45:53.791
Really?

45:53.993 --> 45:56.018
Thomas Edison? Oh.

45:56.228 --> 45:58.492
Well, I... I'm Very glad to see you,

45:58.697 --> 46:01.291
although I don't know who you are.

46:01.534 --> 46:03.229
Oh, yeah.

46:03.435 --> 46:05.926
You're with the FBI,
and you're incognito

46:06.138 --> 46:08.299
and you're just here to
protect the princess, right?

46:08.507 --> 46:09.997
- No.
- No?

46:10.209 --> 46:11.699
I can't lie to you, Fella.

46:12.111 --> 46:13.942
I'm not from the FBI.

46:14.146 --> 46:16.011
I am your godfather.

46:17.583 --> 46:19.517
Your fairy godfather.

46:25.925 --> 46:27.790
Godfather?

46:28.093 --> 46:31.187
Fairy godfather?
You... Like in a fairy tale?

46:33.666 --> 46:35.133
No, you're from the FBI.

46:35.334 --> 46:38.235
What are you guys doing,
playing games or something?

46:38.437 --> 46:40.462
Oh, this is no game, Fella.

46:40.673 --> 46:45.235
I am exactly like
Cinderella's fairy godmother.

46:47.880 --> 46:49.939
As a matter of fact...

46:50.149 --> 46:53.118
...I personally handled Cindy's case.

46:53.319 --> 46:55.913
You... You handled her case.
Why... Why don't you just sit down?

46:56.121 --> 46:57.679
I think you'll feel much better.

46:58.924 --> 47:01.017
Perhaps you better sit down, huh?

47:01.227 --> 47:02.819
I... I should?

47:03.028 --> 47:06.725
You mean, you would rather
haVe me sit down?

47:06.932 --> 47:09.924
I hope this doesn't sound
like braggadocio...

47:10.436 --> 47:14.532
...because really,
I'm a Very modest fairy godfather.

47:14.874 --> 47:16.398
Oh.

47:17.042 --> 47:19.670
But it wasn't a godmother
that Cinderella had.

47:20.145 --> 47:21.874
No?

47:22.648 --> 47:24.513
It was me.

47:25.017 --> 47:26.609
It was you.

47:26.819 --> 47:30.084
- It was me.
- Yes.

47:30.422 --> 47:34.756
You see, Fella, the women reporters
of that period, they wrote the story.

47:34.960 --> 47:38.623
So naturally, they attributed
my magic to a woman.

47:38.831 --> 47:40.731
Women are strange, Fella.

47:40.933 --> 47:42.298
They're like the Russians.

47:42.501 --> 47:45.061
They want credit for
inVenting everything.

47:49.108 --> 47:52.703
Well, I... I... I like you.

47:52.912 --> 47:55.107
I like you Very much.

47:55.314 --> 47:58.909
And... Except that, I just... well...

47:59.118 --> 48:01.484
I don't believe in fairy tales, you see.

48:01.687 --> 48:03.518
Like Cinderella and...

48:03.722 --> 48:05.087
I just don't believe in them.

48:05.291 --> 48:09.125
Oh, well, you haVe just Voiced
a perfectly normal reaction.

48:09.328 --> 48:13.196
But you haVe to believe,
or we won't be able to work together.

48:13.399 --> 48:16.266
Well, I... Work together?

48:17.069 --> 48:19.469
Godfather, Cinderella.

48:19.672 --> 48:21.230
What are you trying to say?

48:21.440 --> 48:23.169
Hate to be corny, boy...

48:23.375 --> 48:25.343
...but you force me.

48:26.812 --> 48:28.439
Cindy!

48:28.847 --> 48:30.474
Cindy!

48:38.857 --> 48:40.518
Good day to you, Godfather.

48:51.737 --> 48:53.728
- Now do you believe me?
- No.

48:53.939 --> 48:56.499
It's a trick.

48:56.775 --> 49:00.438
Like on TV. With those magicians
that saw the women in half.

49:00.646 --> 49:03.240
Oh, no, no, she's real.

49:03.449 --> 49:05.383
You can touch her.

49:06.752 --> 49:09.050
She's real. Touch her?
I could walk right through her.

49:09.254 --> 49:11.017
This is a trick.
She's a "marrage".

49:11.223 --> 49:12.713
I can walk right through...
I've seen...

49:14.393 --> 49:17.362
If I weren't a married woman...

49:20.766 --> 49:24.930
Oh, she's real. Yeah, I mean...

49:25.137 --> 49:26.468
Oh, I'm sorry.

49:26.672 --> 49:30.699
You're married to the Prince Charming.
Mrs. Charming, I'm glad to...

49:30.909 --> 49:34.868
Cinderella, Mrs. Charming. I mean...

49:35.247 --> 49:38.944
- Oh, oh, oh...
- You believe now, eh, Fella?

49:39.151 --> 49:41.449
No, I don't.
I know the story of Cinderella.

49:41.653 --> 49:44.349
She didn't wear shoes,
she wore glass slippers.

49:44.556 --> 49:45.989
Oh, you're right.

49:46.191 --> 49:49.251
But that was with her ball gown.

50:08.447 --> 50:10.438
Real glass?

50:10.849 --> 50:12.544
Unbreakable, sire.

50:12.751 --> 50:15.379
Early laminated windshield glass.

50:16.121 --> 50:19.579
I'd better go now, Godfather.
The Prince is waiting.

50:19.792 --> 50:22.454
It was so nice to see you again.

50:22.661 --> 50:26.097
So nice to see you again, Godfather.

50:26.298 --> 50:28.789
Delighted to haVe met you, sire.

50:29.101 --> 50:33.265
Oh, also Very good to meet up you.

50:33.472 --> 50:35.633
And you'll loVe liVing in a castle.

50:35.841 --> 50:37.570
Castles are so roomy.

50:37.776 --> 50:41.212
So much more comfortable
than tract houses.

50:42.047 --> 50:45.312
Yeah, that's true,
some houses are not the same as...

50:47.553 --> 50:49.043
Miss Person? Lady?

50:50.289 --> 50:52.484
Goodbye, Cinderella.

50:53.225 --> 50:56.058
I mean, Mrs. Charming.

50:57.396 --> 50:59.125
Goodbye.

50:59.898 --> 51:01.229
Me, liVing in a castle?

51:01.433 --> 51:03.867
What did she mean,
I would liVe in a castle?

51:04.069 --> 51:07.300
Fella, you do believe that
I'm your fairy godfather?

51:07.506 --> 51:09.337
Oh, yes, sire. Yes, sir, I do.

51:09.541 --> 51:11.406
Then you will believe
what I tell you now?

51:11.610 --> 51:14.773
- Oh, yes, without a doubt, I will.
- Good.

51:18.684 --> 51:20.015
Fella...

51:20.219 --> 51:23.416
...you haVe been chosen
to rectify all the great wrongs

51:23.622 --> 51:26.250
brought about by
the original Cinderella story.

51:26.458 --> 51:28.517
Through the centuries,
the women of the world,

51:28.727 --> 51:31.355
influenced by the legend
of Cinderella, haVe waited.

51:31.597 --> 51:33.929
Waited for their Prince Charmings
to come galloping

51:34.133 --> 51:36.601
out of the wild blue yonder
on their white horses

51:36.802 --> 51:39.635
to claim their hands in marriage.

51:40.072 --> 51:41.972
Yeah, I... I read that once.

51:42.174 --> 51:44.938
But there was only
one Prince Charming.

51:45.144 --> 51:46.771
And when he didn't appear,

51:46.979 --> 51:50.210
these women married
the closest aVailable man.

51:50.415 --> 51:52.645
And they were
forever after miserable,

51:52.851 --> 51:57.083
because they always regretted,
and they felt that...

51:57.289 --> 51:59.553
Well, that they had
taken second best.

51:59.758 --> 52:01.157
But what is worse,

52:01.360 --> 52:03.487
they made their
poor husbands miserable

52:03.695 --> 52:06.823
because the poor fellow
wasn't a prince.

52:07.633 --> 52:09.726
Oh, the Cinderella legend

52:09.935 --> 52:14.167
has brought nothing but dissatisfaction
to the hearts of women...

52:14.373 --> 52:16.568
...and their husbands haVe
taken the brunt of it.

52:16.875 --> 52:18.206
It's not fair.

52:18.477 --> 52:22.140
I won't bother you with
actual statistics, Fella...

52:22.548 --> 52:26.644
...but the unhappy husbands
of the world are crying for help.

52:26.852 --> 52:29.343
They're crying for a chance
to get even.

52:29.922 --> 52:32.049
It's time for a change.

52:32.391 --> 52:37.385
And you haVe been chosen
to bring out that change.

52:38.263 --> 52:39.821
Change? Out? Chosen me?

52:40.032 --> 52:41.693
I'm? Who chosen?

52:42.000 --> 52:44.434
Oh, you haVe been
chosen by the head man.

52:44.636 --> 52:47.366
- The head man?
- The head man.

52:47.940 --> 52:51.341
The chairman of the board of
directors of all fairy godfathers.

52:51.677 --> 52:55.738
And the Society for the Prevention
of Distorting the Truth in Fairy Tales,

52:55.948 --> 52:58.940
and the Committee for the
PreserVation of Sanity to Married Men.

52:59.218 --> 53:02.051
Chairman of the board?
You had a meeting?

53:02.955 --> 53:05.048
A meeting?

53:05.257 --> 53:07.521
Why, we argued like a summit.

53:07.726 --> 53:10.160
Of course, there were those
who were against you.

53:10.362 --> 53:11.590
What did I do to them?

53:11.797 --> 53:13.788
Oh, they just thought
that the one chosen

53:13.999 --> 53:16.968
should be tall and handsome
and clever.

53:17.169 --> 53:18.830
But I fought for you.

53:19.037 --> 53:23.235
I said you were perfect for the task,
because you're just ordinary.

53:23.442 --> 53:25.137
You're not tall,
you're not handsome,

53:25.344 --> 53:27.403
and you're anything but clever.

53:27.613 --> 53:29.342
Thank you, Godfather,
for taking my part.

53:29.548 --> 53:31.982
Oh, that's all right, that's all right.

53:32.184 --> 53:34.812
- I appreciate it.
- Would you?

53:35.020 --> 53:38.080
Oh, no, thank you.
The filters make me cough.

53:41.760 --> 53:44.820
So you are the one who is
going to settle the score

53:45.030 --> 53:47.828
for all the downtrodden
married men.

53:48.033 --> 53:49.261
And when we finish,

53:49.468 --> 53:53.199
the married men of the world will be
able to look their wiVes in the face,

53:53.405 --> 53:55.134
that is, if they haVe their makeup on,

53:55.340 --> 53:57.171
and put them in their place.

53:57.376 --> 53:59.844
I can hear the husbands saying,

54:00.045 --> 54:02.570
"Why wasn't I lucky like Fella?"

54:02.781 --> 54:06.376
"He's not handsome, he's not tall,
he's not clever,

54:06.585 --> 54:11.579
"but he ended up married to
a beautiful princess, instead of you."

54:12.057 --> 54:13.422
You see, Fella,

54:13.625 --> 54:18.119
the men will be able to get even
for centuries of female abuse.

54:18.330 --> 54:19.922
But best of all,

54:20.132 --> 54:23.124
the best part of it is,
that men and women

54:23.335 --> 54:26.327
will learn to be happy
with each other as they are.

54:26.538 --> 54:27.869
I see, I get it now.

54:28.340 --> 54:31.639
Ordinary people will
accept one another.

54:31.977 --> 54:35.879
Ordinary people will be
satisfied with one another.

54:36.748 --> 54:38.238
Yeah.

54:38.717 --> 54:41.584
Sure. They won't be looking
around for something better.

54:41.787 --> 54:44.347
Now you've got the idea, Fella.
That's the idea.

54:44.556 --> 54:47.855
Yeah. " Boy, that Fella was lucky.

54:48.060 --> 54:50.324
"He was an ordinary guy.

54:50.862 --> 54:53.763
"He wasn't tall,
he wasn't handsome.

54:53.965 --> 54:55.523
"He wasn't even clever.

54:55.734 --> 54:56.962
"And yet...

54:57.169 --> 54:59.797
"...he ended up marrying
a beautiful princess."

55:00.005 --> 55:04.237
That'll teach those nagging wiVes,
won't it, Father Fairygod... sir?

55:04.443 --> 55:07.901
It sure will, Fella. It sure will.

55:08.113 --> 55:11.844
<i>Me? Marry a princess?</i>

55:14.920 --> 55:16.649
Fella!

55:16.855 --> 55:18.379
Jack and Jill!

55:18.590 --> 55:20.717
Fetch a pail of water.

55:21.860 --> 55:24.158
Now, go on, quickly. Quickly.

55:24.363 --> 55:26.228
He must marry the princess.

55:26.431 --> 55:29.867
Oh, thank you so much, children.
Thank you.

55:53.492 --> 55:55.323
You said you wanted
to see her closer?

55:55.527 --> 55:57.586
Well, there she is, Fella.

55:57.796 --> 55:59.491
Oh, I'm sorry.

55:59.698 --> 56:01.222
Yeah, but...

56:01.633 --> 56:03.897
...couldn't I see her even a little closer?

56:04.102 --> 56:06.093
After all, if she's gonna be my wife...

56:06.304 --> 56:10.638
Hey, isn't he holding the future wife
just a little too close?

56:10.842 --> 56:12.503
Oh, stop worrying.

56:12.711 --> 56:15.612
She's all yours, every bit of her.

56:15.814 --> 56:18.908
Yeah, but I'd like to haVe
the bits he's holding.

56:23.622 --> 56:25.021
Now, you wait and watch.

56:25.223 --> 56:28.420
I'll be back as soon as
I fix my magic schedule.

56:28.627 --> 56:30.060
OK.

56:31.129 --> 56:32.721
But shouldn't I?

56:33.799 --> 56:35.699
What would happen if?

56:51.416 --> 56:53.213
Still hugging her too close.

56:53.418 --> 56:55.249
She's gonna...

56:55.454 --> 56:57.251
Stop hugging.

58:00.585 --> 58:02.075
He's moVing in.

58:02.287 --> 58:03.515
We'll be rich.

58:37.522 --> 58:40.514
Maybe if I bite him. No.

58:48.900 --> 58:50.868
It's Mother screaming.

59:07.118 --> 59:08.813
- What is it? What happened?
- A terrible man.

59:09.020 --> 59:11.488
He just... He just ran away.

59:23.735 --> 59:27.262
And remember,
keep dancing with Her Highness.

59:27.472 --> 59:29.406
Never let her out of your arms.

59:29.608 --> 59:34.807
Mother, she'll haVe the same royal
treatment I gaVe the downstairs maid.

59:35.013 --> 59:37.243
That's my son.

59:39.584 --> 59:40.983
And what was that?

59:41.186 --> 59:44.314
Well, you all look Very loVely
this evening.

59:44.522 --> 59:46.683
And what in the world
are you wearing?

59:47.826 --> 59:51.387
Oh, I got this out of the cellar.
This was my father's.

59:51.596 --> 59:54.360
You remember. He wore this the day
he married you, Stepmother.

59:54.566 --> 59:58.195
I was just going upstairs
to tuck it in here and there.

59:58.403 --> 01:00:00.963
You'll still look like a fugitiVe
from Halloween.

01:00:01.172 --> 01:00:02.730
Oh, no, it'll be all right, Rupert.

01:00:02.941 --> 01:00:07.207
I'll just cut one sleeve on the bias here
a little bit, but it'll be fine.

01:00:07.412 --> 01:00:09.812
And then where do you think
you're going?

01:00:10.015 --> 01:00:11.277
To the ball.

01:00:13.885 --> 01:00:17.651
Oh, is that so, smart alecks?
Well, I was inVited to go to the ball.

01:00:17.856 --> 01:00:21.292
I sent out the inVitations.
And you certainly weren't on the list.

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:25.054
Oh, no, you didn't inVite me,
Stepmother. He inVited me.

01:00:25.263 --> 01:00:26.992
He? Who's he?

01:00:27.198 --> 01:00:28.688
Well, my...

01:00:30.301 --> 01:00:32.064
Well, I was just inVited.

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:35.239
Maybe your old man inVited you.
You dreamed it again, huh, spook?

01:00:35.573 --> 01:00:38.667
Maybe your father wanted you to take
out that fat suit and giVe it an airing.

01:00:38.877 --> 01:00:40.868
Why don't you wear one
of your mother's old dresses,

01:00:41.079 --> 01:00:43.013
and I'll dance with you.

01:00:44.315 --> 01:00:46.306
Don't talk about my mother.

01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:48.315
Take that silly suit
back to the cellar.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.711
And while you're there,
fire the furnace.

01:00:50.922 --> 01:00:53.390
We haVe a small group
coming here after the ball.

01:00:53.591 --> 01:00:56.219
Come, boys. We'll be late.

01:00:57.162 --> 01:00:58.652
But I was inVited.

01:00:58.863 --> 01:01:01.991
- You're dreaming again.
- You're cracking up, creep.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.954
Well, Maximilian. I guess Mother
knew what she was doing,

01:01:59.157 --> 01:02:02.058
spending the rest of our money
on this little inVestment.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:05.991
I'm still banking on Fella's dream.

01:02:06.197 --> 01:02:10.224
If this continues,
we won't need Fella's dream.

01:03:25.043 --> 01:03:26.908
<i>Where do I fit in this house?</i>

01:03:29.414 --> 01:03:32.076
<i>Am I a man or a mouse?</i>

01:03:32.283 --> 01:03:35.480
<i>I've been a mouse long enough, bub</i>

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:41.421
<i>I might even resign from</i>
<i>The Mickey Mouse Club</i>

01:03:46.898 --> 01:03:50.197
<i>There are two kinds of people</i>
<i>In this world</i>

01:03:50.401 --> 01:03:55.270
<i>The good guys and the bad guys</i>

01:04:00.111 --> 01:04:05.913
<i>The good guys live in</i>
<i>Sweetness and honey</i>

01:04:06.584 --> 01:04:09.849
<i>The bad guys wind up</i>
<i>Having all the fun</i>

01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:13.683
<i>And getting all the money</i>

01:04:22.834 --> 01:04:24.426
<i>I'm gonna be me in reverse</i>

01:04:24.636 --> 01:04:27.366
<i>I'm sure it couldn't be worse</i>
<i>Than what I am now</i>

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:31.269
<i>A nothing</i>
<i>A nobody</i>

01:04:34.279 --> 01:04:37.771
<i>You've gotta be sharp</i>

01:04:37.982 --> 01:04:41.474
<i>You've gotta be wise</i>

01:04:41.686 --> 01:04:45.213
<i>And leave all the dreaming</i>

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:48.722
<i>To those other guys</i>

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:54.957
<i>Only a fool bothers to follow</i>
<i>A losing cause</i>

01:04:55.166 --> 01:04:59.432
<i>Like believing in fairy godfathers</i>

01:04:59.637 --> 01:05:03.004
<i>Or in Santa Claus</i>

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.335
<i>I'm taking off</i>
<i>I've had it</i>

01:05:07.545 --> 01:05:09.979
<i>I'll never be nice anymore</i>

01:05:11.382 --> 01:05:14.943
<i>Or walk old women</i>
<i>Across the street anymore</i>

01:05:15.153 --> 01:05:17.053
<i>I'm gonna be mean</i>
<i>Hard as nails</i>

01:05:17.255 --> 01:05:21.555
<i>Walk on snails</i>
<i>Tie tin cans to puppy dog tails</i>

01:05:21.759 --> 01:05:25.490
<i>Who knows?</i>
<i>If I change my ways</i>

01:05:25.697 --> 01:05:28.996
<i>I may turn into a person</i>

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.727
<i>One of these days</i>

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:41.809
<i>Let me be a person</i>

01:05:42.013 --> 01:05:45.915
<i>A social V.I.P.</i>

01:05:46.117 --> 01:05:50.213
<i>I'm all through with going around</i>

01:05:50.421 --> 01:05:54.551
<i>As plain old me</i>

01:05:54.759 --> 01:05:58.456
<i>I wanna be a member of Who's Who</i>

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:02.121
<i>If the shoe doesn't fit</i>
<i>I'll get another shoe</i>

01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:08.329
<i>I'll see red till my blood turns blue</i>
<i>Look out</i>

01:06:08.539 --> 01:06:16.503
<i>This Fella is finally coming out</i>

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:35.029
I heard everything you said.
EVerything. I'm surprised.

01:06:35.233 --> 01:06:40.830
No, I'm not surprised.
I'm appalled by your lack of faith.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:43.906
Well, well, you see...
Actually, let me explain. You see.

01:06:44.108 --> 01:06:46.770
- The... The... I... I...
- Oh, I see. I...

01:06:46.978 --> 01:06:49.344
That's why I changed this attire.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:52.812
If you can no longer believe
in your fairy godfather,

01:06:53.017 --> 01:06:56.953
maybe it'll be easier for you
to believe in the fairy godmother.

01:06:57.155 --> 01:07:00.613
I'm up on all this Oedipus nonsense,
you know.

01:07:00.825 --> 01:07:02.884
Well, I'm awfully sorry,
Fairy Godmother.

01:07:03.094 --> 01:07:06.427
Godfath... Godfath...
Well, I... I hope you forgiVe me.

01:07:06.631 --> 01:07:08.963
- I believe you.
- Good.

01:07:09.834 --> 01:07:13.861
That'll giVe me a chance to get rid
of this silly outfit that I borrowed.

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:17.803
I borrowed this from
a Halloween witch I used to date.

01:07:19.377 --> 01:07:23.677
It's getting late.
We've got lots to do.

01:11:21.686 --> 01:11:23.813
Excuse me.

01:11:24.722 --> 01:11:26.849
Our dance, Your Highness?

01:11:27.725 --> 01:11:29.784
With whom shall I be dancing?

01:11:30.895 --> 01:11:34.831
With one who is truly...

01:11:35.399 --> 01:11:39.859
...fond of you,
and who worships you Very much.

01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:57.213
Maximilian, it doesn't
seem possible...

01:11:57.555 --> 01:11:59.250
...but that is Corkhead.

01:11:59.457 --> 01:12:02.688
Don't be silly, Mother.
That's a much older man.

01:15:09.813 --> 01:15:14.011
Is it true, princess, that you
came here to find a husband?

01:15:14.351 --> 01:15:16.319
Let's talk about you.

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.818
HaVen't we met before?

01:15:20.057 --> 01:15:23.049
We? You and I?
Met before?

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:27.253
Oh, I doubt it.
I... I don't think so.

01:15:31.368 --> 01:15:33.928
Yes, we haVe.

01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:38.371
Well, I can't lie to you, princess.

01:15:38.576 --> 01:15:41.545
We haVe met before, but...

01:15:42.012 --> 01:15:46.005
Well, I'm not a duke or a duchy.

01:15:46.317 --> 01:15:49.343
I mean, any of those things like that.

01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:53.788
As a matter of fact, I'm a phony.

01:15:55.326 --> 01:15:58.955
EVen the clothes I'm wearing
aren't mine.

01:15:59.496 --> 01:16:02.863
I didn't even work
to get this gray hair.

01:16:03.367 --> 01:16:08.304
And, well, I don't like a phony...

01:16:09.239 --> 01:16:11.639
...and I don't think you should
be stuck with one.

01:16:13.711 --> 01:16:17.010
I don't understand,
but I'm sure we'll get along.

01:16:17.214 --> 01:16:20.342
Well, I... I think that...

01:16:20.551 --> 01:16:23.748
I think I'll haVe to get along.
That's my cue.

01:16:23.954 --> 01:16:26.354
What do you mean?
What do you mean, your cue?

01:16:26.557 --> 01:16:30.618
Well, what I'm trying to say is that
the fish will turn into the car,

01:16:30.828 --> 01:16:34.195
the car that was the chauffeur's,
the fish that was my bike.

01:16:34.398 --> 01:16:35.626
What?

01:16:35.833 --> 01:16:38.859
Well, I can't explain, but I wanna
thank you Very much for the dance.

01:16:39.069 --> 01:16:43.472
I'll never forget it,
and I'll never forget you.

01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:49.536
Come back.
Oh, please, come back.

01:17:01.458 --> 01:17:06.486
<i>In a cabin or a castle</i>

01:17:07.598 --> 01:17:12.058
<i>Even though you rise or fall</i>

01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:16.598
<i>Without somebody</i>

01:17:16.807 --> 01:17:20.504
<i>You're nobody at all</i>

01:17:24.481 --> 01:17:28.144
<i>Without somebody</i>

01:17:28.385 --> 01:17:33.345
<i>You're nobody at all</i>

01:18:10.427 --> 01:18:12.395
We better get home before
the last stroke of midnight.

01:18:12.596 --> 01:18:14.621
Otherwise my car
will turn back to a bike,

01:18:14.832 --> 01:18:16.959
and you'll be a fish again,
and out of water.

01:18:17.167 --> 01:18:19.397
You won't be able to breathe,
and I'll haVe a fishy bike.

01:18:23.207 --> 01:18:25.471
The change has started.

01:18:25.909 --> 01:18:27.638
Wait a minute.

01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:32.715
Watch it. Watch it.

01:18:32.916 --> 01:18:35.146
Don't waste the water.
You need all you can get.

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:41.717
It's happening!
Here, fish. Rest.

01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:45.293
Don't you worry, fish. What's the
difference what transportation we haVe,

01:18:45.496 --> 01:18:46.929
as long as you drink.

01:19:12.356 --> 01:19:14.586
Keep breathing.
Keep breathing, fish.

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:17.124
That's it. Breathe deep.

01:19:24.902 --> 01:19:26.870
Where's your?

01:19:27.337 --> 01:19:30.704
Your little red jacket?

01:19:30.908 --> 01:19:33.376
- What red jacket?
- You know which one I mean.

01:19:33.577 --> 01:19:36.137
Why don't you haVe
the little red coat, baby?

01:19:36.346 --> 01:19:38.814
- What are you talking about, Maxie?
- If you haVe red coat,

01:19:39.016 --> 01:19:42.747
it means that you haVe
a little bit of money, money.

01:19:42.953 --> 01:19:44.443
- Money?
- Millions. Money.

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:46.088
What money?
What are you talking about?

01:19:46.290 --> 01:19:48.884
Oh, come on, baby.
Let's haVe a little money.

01:19:49.092 --> 01:19:51.117
Max, I don't know,
that's all you ever talk about is...

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:53.626
I don't know... I don't know
what you're talking about, money.

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:56.891
Look, baby, I'm gonna
giVe you three seconds

01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:01.628
to tell me where the money is,
before I bop you on your bopper.

01:20:02.306 --> 01:20:06.208
Max, that's real important
to you, money?

01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:08.674
That's all you really
care about. Well...

01:20:08.879 --> 01:20:10.369
Well, I know where the money is.

01:20:10.581 --> 01:20:12.674
I always knew where
the money is, Max.

01:20:12.883 --> 01:20:18.082
And if you really want the money,
you're gonna get it, Maxie.

01:20:45.282 --> 01:20:47.580
You don't haVe to leaVe the house.

01:20:48.785 --> 01:20:51.151
You can stay now.

01:20:51.355 --> 01:20:52.754
You can afford it.

01:20:54.992 --> 01:20:58.621
But the money is yours.
Your father left it for you.

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:01.997
Yes, but you've always
loVed money, Stepmother.

01:21:02.199 --> 01:21:04.133
Your boys haVe always
loVed money.

01:21:04.334 --> 01:21:07.531
And you've put up with me
all these years hoping to get it.

01:21:07.738 --> 01:21:08.966
Well, here it is.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.270
I hope you'll all be Very happy.

01:21:12.476 --> 01:21:15.843
And now, you don't haVe to
put up with me any longer.

01:21:23.687 --> 01:21:25.245
Fella.

01:21:27.224 --> 01:21:29.158
I'm sorry.

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:37.563
LeaVe that alone.

01:21:38.035 --> 01:21:39.798
It's Fella's.

01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:03.783
Hello, Fella.

01:22:04.328 --> 01:22:05.795
Hello...

01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:09.527
How? How'd you know my name?

01:22:10.867 --> 01:22:13.427
HaVe we met before?

01:22:13.837 --> 01:22:15.964
I think so.

01:22:16.606 --> 01:22:19.131
But that's not important
at the moment.

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:26.442
You see, I'm working
my way through college.

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:29.016
I'm selling shoes.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.748
I haVe a sample right here.

01:22:35.792 --> 01:22:38.818
Would? Would you be interested
in a shoe like this?

01:22:46.036 --> 01:22:48.334
Please try it on.

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:52.135
I'm sure it would fit you perfectly.

01:22:54.544 --> 01:22:58.503
No. I think that would be
just a little too big for me.

01:22:59.449 --> 01:23:01.076
Well, good luck.

01:23:01.284 --> 01:23:03.616
I haVe to be getting along.

01:23:14.097 --> 01:23:15.758
Fella...

01:23:17.634 --> 01:23:18.999
...I loVe you.

01:23:26.109 --> 01:23:28.077
You can't loVe me.

01:23:28.278 --> 01:23:29.768
But I do.

01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:32.312
Ple... Please listen to me.

01:23:32.516 --> 01:23:36.418
It's no good.
You're a person and I'm a people.

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.451
I'm a girl.

01:23:38.655 --> 01:23:40.179
You're a princess.

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.416
Well, is? Isn't a princess a girl?

01:23:43.994 --> 01:23:47.259
Well, then I'm...
I'm just an ordinary fella.

01:23:47.464 --> 01:23:52.401
Well, I'm just an ordinary
girl princess.

01:23:52.969 --> 01:23:54.800
Well, you certainly
don't look ordinary.

01:23:55.005 --> 01:23:56.666
But I can.

01:23:56.873 --> 01:24:00.400
It's just like you said, Fella.
Don't... Don't let the clothes fool you.

01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:02.635
Oh, it's more than that.

01:24:02.846 --> 01:24:04.939
- It... It's no good.
- No, Fella.

01:24:05.148 --> 01:24:07.309
It's just like you said.
It's just the clothes.

01:24:07.517 --> 01:24:10.247
It's no good. I'm a people
and you're a person,

01:24:10.454 --> 01:24:13.946
and it... It just won't mix, that's all.

01:24:14.157 --> 01:24:17.320
Fella, please listen to me. Fella.

01:24:17.861 --> 01:24:21.126
Fella, please look at me. Please.

01:24:21.331 --> 01:24:24.027
Just, please.

01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:30.801
Come back, Fella. I loVe you.

01:25:01.538 --> 01:25:05.668
<i>Someone to have</i>

01:25:05.876 --> 01:25:12.247
<i>A midnight cup of tea with</i>

01:25:14.351 --> 01:25:18.287
<i>To have and hold</i>

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:21.082
<i>Sometimes</i>

01:25:22.559 --> 01:25:25.756
<i>Disagree with</i>

01:25:27.898 --> 01:25:33.564
<i>Oh, it's wonderful to live</i>

01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:37.536
<i>For somebody</i>

01:25:39.209 --> 01:25:44.613
<i>And the most you have to give</i>

01:25:45.615 --> 01:25:49.210
<i>Is your love</i>
