JOE:
My father is getting married again.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.872
For five years, he's been living
with a woman named Gillian...

15:58.040 --> 16:00.124
...who studied decorating
at Caesar's Palace.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.542
Is it porcelain?

KATHLEEN: Once I read a story about a
butterfly in the subway, and today...

16:08.300 --> 16:09.717
...I saw one.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.804
It got on at 42nd
and off at 59th where...

16:12.972 --> 16:14.639
...I assume it went
to Bloomingdale's...

16:14.807 --> 16:17.058
...to buy a hat that will
turn out to be a mistake.

Listen to this:

16:22.398 --> 16:25.066
Every night a truck pulls up
to my neighborhood bagel place...

16:25.275 --> 16:28.069
...and pumps about a ton of flour
into underground tanks.

16:28.320 --> 16:32.198

Pride and Prejudice about 200 times.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.583
I get lost in the language. Words like:

"Thither."

"Mischance."

20:43.825 --> 20:45.868
...do I do it because I like it...

20:46.078 --> 20:48.496
...or because I haven't been brave?

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:56.756
...whose last book is being used
as a trivet all over the world...

01:08:57.006 --> 01:08:59.259
...you are completely crazy."

01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:03.680
She was insulting and provocative
and the only thing pleasant about her...

01:09:03.889 --> 01:09:07.142
...was the way her hair
fell across her forehead.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:11.229
Underneath that disagreeable
exterior, she may be--

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:13.398
JOE:
A real bitch.

01:09:13.607 --> 01:09:14.774
Let's not talk about it.

01:09:14.942 --> 01:09:17.609
I'm going back to the office
and I'm sure you have work to do.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:18.903
Not really.

01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:22.573
This place is a well-oiled machine,
my friend.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.493
So? What happened?

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:29.956
-He never came.
-He stood you up.

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:32.167
KATHLEEN:
I wouldn't characterize it that way.

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:33.501
I think something happened.

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:37.714
Something unexpected that
made it impossible for him to....

01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:41.176
What if he showed up,
took one look at me and left?

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:43.261
Not possible.

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.930
Maybe there was a subway accident.

01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:48.308
Absolutely.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:50.768
A train got trapped underground
with him inside.

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:51.978
And no phone.

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:54.522
KATHLEEN: You know how those
express trains create suction.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:56.566
He got sucked onto the tracks.

01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:57.775
The third rail.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.777
CHRISTINA:
He's toast.

01:10:00.112 --> 01:10:01.613
What happened?

01:10:02.364 --> 01:10:03.615
He was unable to make it.

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:05.575
He stood you up?

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:13.249
Maybe he had a car accident.
Those cab drivers are maniacs.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:17.545
They hit something and you slam
into that plastic partition.

01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:21.174
Or his elbows could be in splints,
so he couldn't dial.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.718
Or he could be unconscious.

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:24.969
In a coma.

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:27.388
Stuck in intensive care.

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:29.224
With a heart monitor beeping.

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:30.600
And like....

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:31.976
-No phone.
-No phone.

01:10:35.773 --> 01:10:37.482
What?

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:42.362
What are you saying?

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:43.988
It could be.

01:10:44.156 --> 01:10:46.616
He was arrested
two blocks from the café.

01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:48.493
Is there a picture?

01:10:51.872 --> 01:10:53.665
So that explains it.

01:10:54.166 --> 01:10:55.500
He was in jail.

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:57.669
And there was a phone.

01:10:57.878 --> 01:11:00.046
He only got one call,
so he called his lawyer.

01:11:00.297 --> 01:11:01.673
You are so lucky.

01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:03.508
You could be dead.

01:11:06.136 --> 01:11:08.846
He couldn't be the Rooftop Killer.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:12.392
Remember when you thought
Frank might be the Unabomber?

01:11:12.726 --> 01:11:15.645
Well.... That was different.

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:18.731
How long did you sit there all alone?

01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:22.694
-Not long. Joe Fox came in.
-Joe Fox?

01:11:22.861 --> 01:11:25.238
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's get to work.

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:28.574
There's got to be something to do.
There's always something to do.

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:31.828
GEORGE: Look at this.
CHRISTINA: He looks kind of cute.

01:11:32.037 --> 01:11:33.788
[DOOR BELL RINGS]

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:36.165
BIRDIE:
So?

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:38.960
He was unavoidably detained.

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:41.546
BIRDIE:
He stood you up?

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:47.885
KATHLEEN:
I've been thinking about you.

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:52.307
Last night I went to meet you,
and you weren't there.

01:11:54.059 --> 01:11:57.645
I wish I knew why. I felt so foolish.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.441
And as I waited,
someone else showed up.

01:12:01.608 --> 01:12:04.861
A man who has made
my professional life a misery.

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:07.572
And an amazing thing happened.

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.659
I was able, for the first time...

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:14.078
...to say the exact thing
I wanted to say...

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:17.206
...at the exact moment
I wanted to say it.

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:21.461
And of course, afterwards I felt terrible...

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:24.088
...just as you said I would.

01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:27.800
I was cruel, and I'm never cruel.

01:12:28.635 --> 01:12:31.679
Though I hardly believe
what I said mattered to this man.

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:34.932
To him, I am just a bug to be crushed.

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:36.934
But what if it did?

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:41.189
No matter what he's done to me,
there is no excuse for my behavior.

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:43.274
Anyway...

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:45.943
...I so wanted to talk to you.

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:49.322
I hope you have a good reason
for not being there last night.

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:53.409
You don't seem like the kind of person
who'd do something like that.

01:12:53.994 --> 01:12:56.120
The odd thing about this
form of communication...

01:12:56.288 --> 01:12:59.165
...is that you're more likely to talk
about nothing than something.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:00.917
But I just want to say...

01:13:01.126 --> 01:13:04.754
...that all this nothing has meant
more to me than so many...

01:13:04.963 --> 01:13:06.631
...somethings.

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:09.717
So thanks.

MALE AOL VOICE:
Goodbye.

01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:23.082
JOE:
I am in...

01:14:26.503 --> 01:14:28.212
...Vancouver.

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:40.975
I was stuck in a meeting
which I couldn't get out of...

01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:42.393
...and...

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:44.520
...the electricity went out.

01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:46.272
And...

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.732
...we were trapped...

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.109
...on the 38th floor.

01:14:51.778 --> 01:14:54.280
And the telephone system blew too.

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:03.289
Amazingly enough.

01:15:38.408 --> 01:15:40.159
Dear friend:

01:15:43.163 --> 01:15:46.082
I cannot tell you
what happened last night.

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:49.835
But I beg you
from the bottom of my heart...

01:15:50.003 --> 01:15:52.129
...to forgive me for not being there.

01:16:00.597 --> 01:16:02.181
For what happened.

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:08.396
I feel terrible that you
found yourself in a situation...

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:11.440
...that caused you additional pain.

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:15.653
But I'm absolutely sure...

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:19.532
...that whatever you said last night
was provoked.

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:21.450
Even deserved.

01:16:24.955 --> 01:16:29.208
Everyone says things they regret
when they're worried or stressed.

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:34.630
You were expecting to see
someone you trusted...

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.258
...and met the enemy instead.

01:16:40.887 --> 01:16:42.763
The fault is mine.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.935
Someday I'll explain everything.

01:16:48.478 --> 01:16:49.770
Meanwhile...

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:51.355
...I'm still here.

01:16:52.357 --> 01:16:53.566
Talk to me.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:56.569
Did he say anything about
wanting to meet you again?

01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:58.279
No, not really.

01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:00.364
Listen, it doesn't matter.

01:17:00.532 --> 01:17:03.367
We'll just be like George Bernard Shaw
and Mrs. Patrick Campbell.

01:17:03.535 --> 01:17:04.827
We'll write letters our whole lives.

01:17:06.538 --> 01:17:09.290
BIRDIE: Thank you for the scones.
They look lovely.

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:12.877
Birdie, where was this one taken?

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.503
Seville.

01:17:14.671 --> 01:17:16.964
KATHLEEN: When you fell madly in love?
BIRDIE: Yes.

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:20.593
So, dearie, what have you decided to do?

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:23.387
Close. We're going to close.

01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:25.222
Close.

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:30.311
Closing the store is the brave thing to do.

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:33.689
You are such a liar. But thank you.

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:40.071
You are daring to imagine that
you could have a different life.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:45.785
I know it doesn't feel like that.
You feel like a big, fat failure now.

01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:47.203
But you're not.

01:17:47.579 --> 01:17:51.707
You are marching into
the unknown, armed with...

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:52.917
...nothing.

01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:55.336
Have a sandwich.

01:17:56.463 --> 01:17:59.882
Not nothing. I have a little money saved.

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:03.928
If you need more, ask me. I'm very rich.

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:06.931
I bought Intel at six.

01:18:10.268 --> 01:18:12.978
I suppose you want me
to tell you who it was...

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:15.564
...I fell madly in love with.

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:17.733
But I'm not going to tell.

01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:19.944
Who was it, Birdie?

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:23.864
Come on, tell. Uch. That's so mean.

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:26.325
But so romantic.

01:18:26.493 --> 01:18:28.953
BIRDIE: It wasn't meant to be.
-Why not?

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.622
He ran Spain.

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:34.250
Spain?

01:18:34.459 --> 01:18:37.002
The country, he ran it. It was his job.

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:39.004
And then he died.

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:40.881
Just as well.

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.633
Milk or lemon?

01:18:44.177 --> 01:18:47.304
She fell in love with
Generalissimo Franco.

01:18:47.472 --> 01:18:49.557
Don't say that.
We don't know that for sure.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:52.810
Who else could it have been?
It was around 1960.

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:55.604
-Do you want some popcorn?
-I can't believe this.

01:18:56.815 --> 01:19:01.402
It's not like he was something normal,
like a socialist or an anarchist.

01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:03.279
It happened in Spain.

01:19:03.488 --> 01:19:05.781
People do stupid things
in foreign countries.

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:08.993
They buy leather jackets
for much more than they're worth.

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:12.538
But they don't fall in love
with fascist dictators.

01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:21.547
[WHISPERING]
Birdie is a very special person to me.

01:19:21.798 --> 01:19:24.508
She is practically my surrogate mother.

01:19:24.676 --> 01:19:26.135
[WHISPERING]
She's out of her mind.

01:19:26.303 --> 01:19:27.344
She is not.

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:31.891
I could never be with anybody who
doesn't take politics as seriously as I do.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.225
WOMAN:
Do you mind?

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:34.894
A hot dog is singing.

01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:38.189
You need quiet
while a hot dog is singing?

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:44.028
I have something to tell you, Frank.

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:47.448
-I didn't vote.
-What?

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.450
In the last mayoral election...

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:52.620
...when Rudy Giuliani was running
against Ruth Messinger...

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:54.622
...I went to get a manicure.

01:19:54.831 --> 01:19:56.874
And forgot to vote.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:58.709
Since when do you get manicures?

01:19:58.877 --> 01:20:01.962
I suppose you could never be with
a woman who got manicures?

01:20:03.089 --> 01:20:05.549
It's okay. I forgive you.

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:07.676
You forgive me?

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:19.605
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:22.817
This has been a big week.
You're closing the store.

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:26.237
No, it's not that. Really, it's not.

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:29.448
I know, I know. That was terrible of me.

01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:32.117
What was terrible?

01:20:32.285 --> 01:20:35.079
Jumping all over you when I'm the one....

01:20:36.581 --> 01:20:38.999
I don't even know how to say this.

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:41.460
What is it?

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:43.587
What?

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:47.591
You're a wonderful person.

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:49.718
So are you.

01:20:49.928 --> 01:20:54.098
And I'm so honored that
you'd want to be with me...

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:58.394
...because you wouldn't be with
anyone who wasn't truly worthy.

01:20:58.603 --> 01:21:01.313
-I feel exactly the same way.
-No, God, don't--

01:21:01.773 --> 01:21:05.109
Don't say that.
That makes it worse.

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:06.777
What?

01:21:08.321 --> 01:21:09.530
You don't love me.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:18.289
Me either.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.624
You don't love me?

01:21:22.168 --> 01:21:23.252
No.

01:21:23.628 --> 01:21:25.462
But we're so right for each other.

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:28.841
I know. I know.

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:32.928

01:36:40.586 --> 01:36:43.046
Uh, just a second!

01:36:49.887 --> 01:36:52.514
Yes, just a second.

01:37:03.275 --> 01:37:04.400
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:37:05.236 --> 01:37:06.653
What are you doing here?

01:37:07.071 --> 01:37:08.655
I heard you were sick.

01:37:08.906 --> 01:37:10.406
And I was worried.

01:37:12.076 --> 01:37:14.911
And I wanted to make sure....

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:16.246
What?

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:18.498
-Is there somebody here?
-No.

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:21.459
Oh. It's the Home Shopping Network.

01:37:21.752 --> 01:37:23.920
You buy any of those
little porcelain dolls?

01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:25.922
I was thinking about it.

01:37:26.632 --> 01:37:29.175
-You put me out of business.
-Yes, I did.

01:37:29.426 --> 01:37:31.052
-Did you come to gloat?
-No.

01:37:31.303 --> 01:37:33.179
-To offer me a job?
-I would never--

01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:36.766
I have plenty of offers.
I got offered a job by--

01:37:36.976 --> 01:37:39.102
-By my former....
-Your former?

01:37:39.937 --> 01:37:40.979
We broke up.

01:37:41.188 --> 01:37:44.607
That's too bad.
You were so perfect for each other.

01:37:45.067 --> 01:37:46.276
Oh.

01:37:47.778 --> 01:37:50.655
I don't mean to say things like that.
No matter what you've done...

01:37:50.948 --> 01:37:53.199
...there's no excuse for my saying that.

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:54.617
Every time I see you--

01:37:54.785 --> 01:37:56.995
Things like that just
fly out of your mouth.

01:37:59.582 --> 01:38:00.790
I brought you flowers.

01:38:02.793 --> 01:38:04.294
Ohh.

01:38:04.461 --> 01:38:05.503
Thank you.

01:38:10.968 --> 01:38:13.219
Why don't I just put these in some water?

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.598
You're sick. You should sit down.

01:38:22.521 --> 01:38:23.897
I need a vase.

01:38:24.899 --> 01:38:26.858
Above the refrigerator.

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:29.819
JOE:
There it is. Obviously.

01:38:30.988 --> 01:38:33.698
George says hello, by the way.

01:38:35.492 --> 01:38:36.993
He told me you were sick.

01:38:37.328 --> 01:38:38.745
How is George?

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:42.165
Great, really great.

01:38:42.499 --> 01:38:44.876
He's revolutionizing the place.

01:38:45.127 --> 01:38:46.544
You can't work in his department...

01:38:46.837 --> 01:38:49.422
...unless you have a Ph.D.
in Children's Literature.

01:38:49.715 --> 01:38:51.341
I love daisies.

01:38:52.551 --> 01:38:55.011
-You told me.
-They're so friendly.

01:38:55.346 --> 01:38:58.681
Don't you think daisies
are the friendliest flower?

01:38:58.849 --> 01:38:59.849
I do.

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:02.185
When did you break up?

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:04.687
Couple of weeks ago.

01:39:05.522 --> 01:39:08.191
Everyone is breaking up. You. Me.

01:39:08.359 --> 01:39:11.903
This other person I know broke up
with someone in an elevator.

01:39:12.154 --> 01:39:14.864
Or after it, or just outside it or....

01:39:15.157 --> 01:39:16.866
It got stuck.

01:39:17.409 --> 01:39:20.787
When I saw you at the coffee place,
I was waiting for him.

01:39:21.038 --> 01:39:22.372
And I was....

01:39:22.539 --> 01:39:23.873
Charming.

01:39:24.416 --> 01:39:25.917
I was not charming.

01:39:26.168 --> 01:39:27.877
JOE:
You looked charming. Tea?

01:39:28.045 --> 01:39:29.587
Yes. I was....

01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:32.465
I was upset and horrible.

01:39:33.092 --> 01:39:34.801
JOE: Honey?
-Yes.

01:39:34.969 --> 01:39:36.260
I was the horrible one.

01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:38.054
Well, that's true.

01:39:38.305 --> 01:39:40.765
But I have no excuse.

01:39:41.392 --> 01:39:43.559
Oh, I see what you're saying.

01:39:44.603 --> 01:39:45.812
That's interesting.

01:39:46.063 --> 01:39:48.064
Whereas I am a horrible person...

01:39:48.273 --> 01:39:51.859
...therefore I have no choice
but to be horrible.

01:39:52.111 --> 01:39:55.238
That's what you're saying.
But that's all right.

01:39:55.406 --> 01:39:58.074
I put you out of business so...

01:39:58.742 --> 01:40:00.243
...you're entitled to hate me.

01:40:01.745 --> 01:40:03.246
I don't hate you.

01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:06.416
But you'll never forgive me.

01:40:06.792 --> 01:40:08.960
-Just like Elizabeth.
-Who?

01:40:09.628 --> 01:40:11.879
Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice.

01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:13.131
She was too proud.

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:15.758
I thought you hated Pride and Prejudice.

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:18.511
Or was she too prejudiced...

01:40:18.762 --> 01:40:21.264
...and Mr. Darcy is too proud?

01:40:21.473 --> 01:40:22.849
I can't remember.

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.024
It wasn't personal.

01:40:31.316 --> 01:40:34.652
What is that supposed to mean?
I'm so sick of that.

01:40:34.903 --> 01:40:38.281
All that means is that
it wasn't personal to you.

01:40:38.490 --> 01:40:40.283
But it was personal to me.

01:40:40.492 --> 01:40:42.785
It's personal to a lot of people.

01:40:42.995 --> 01:40:46.039
What is so wrong
with being personal anyway?

01:40:47.207 --> 01:40:48.541
Nothing.

01:40:48.792 --> 01:40:52.920
Whatever else anything is,
it ought to begin by being personal.

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.676
My head is starting to get fuzzy.

01:41:03.974 --> 01:41:05.933
Why did you stop by again? I forget.

01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:08.728
I wanted to be your friend.

01:41:09.938 --> 01:41:11.314
Oh.

01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:14.275
I knew it wasn't possible.

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:18.446
Sometimes a guy
just wants the impossible.

01:41:28.373 --> 01:41:30.291
Can I ask you a question?

01:41:30.501 --> 01:41:31.667
What?

01:41:33.504 --> 01:41:36.172
What happened with that guy
at the café?

01:41:37.049 --> 01:41:38.174
Nothing.

01:41:38.383 --> 01:41:40.259
But you're crazy about him?

01:41:41.637 --> 01:41:42.678
Yes, I am.

01:41:42.846 --> 01:41:46.265
Why don't you run off with him?
What are you waiting for?

01:41:48.685 --> 01:41:50.645
I don't actually know him.

01:41:51.188 --> 01:41:52.271
Really?

01:41:54.858 --> 01:41:57.527
I only know him through....

01:41:58.362 --> 01:41:59.821
You won't believe this.

01:41:59.988 --> 01:42:01.656
JOE:
Let me guess.

01:42:02.199 --> 01:42:03.533
Through the Internet?

01:42:05.035 --> 01:42:06.577
Yes.

01:42:08.497 --> 01:42:09.580
JOE:
Hmm.

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:12.250
"You've got mail."

01:42:12.417 --> 01:42:13.876
Yes.

01:42:16.213 --> 01:42:17.588
Those are very powerful words.

01:42:18.215 --> 01:42:19.715
Yes.

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:24.554
I'm happy for him.

01:42:25.931 --> 01:42:27.682
Although....

01:42:29.017 --> 01:42:30.935
Could I just make a suggestion?

01:42:31.562 --> 01:42:32.895
What?

01:42:33.355 --> 01:42:34.814
I think...

01:42:35.357 --> 01:42:37.066
...you should meet him.

01:42:37.568 --> 01:42:40.027
No, wait, I take that back.

01:42:40.946 --> 01:42:43.823
Why would you meet somebody
you're crazy about?

01:42:44.074 --> 01:42:47.743
I hardly think I need to take advice
from a person who--

01:42:50.122 --> 01:42:52.331
I can see I bring out the worst in you.

01:42:52.583 --> 01:42:55.209
Let me help you to not say something...

01:42:55.419 --> 01:42:59.922
...you'll torture yourself about
for years to come.

01:43:13.103 --> 01:43:15.271
I hope you feel better soon.

01:43:16.607 --> 01:43:18.941
It'd be a shame to miss New York
in the spring.

01:43:23.155 --> 01:43:24.739
Thank you for the daisies.

01:43:35.792 --> 01:43:38.461
Well, you take care.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.922
I will.

01:43:42.132 --> 01:43:43.257
Goodbye.

01:43:45.135 --> 01:43:46.469
Goodbye.

01:44:03.487 --> 01:44:05.696
KATHLEEN:
I've been thinking about this...

01:44:05.948 --> 01:44:08.032
...and I think we should meet.

01:44:14.706 --> 01:44:16.332
JOE:
We should meet.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.793
And we will meet.

01:44:19.294 --> 01:44:23.297
But I'm in the middle
of a project that needs...

01:44:28.512 --> 01:44:30.179
...tweaking.

01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:51.367
Some tweaking?

01:44:52.035 --> 01:44:53.911
A project that needed...

01:44:54.079 --> 01:44:55.204
..."tweaking."

01:44:55.372 --> 01:44:59.542
-Yeah, that's what he said.
-T-W-E-A-K-I-N-G? Tweaking.

01:45:00.210 --> 01:45:03.212
It sounds to me like he's married.

01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:04.547
Three kids.

01:45:04.715 --> 01:45:07.717
That's a terrible thing to say.
He couldn't be married.

01:45:08.010 --> 01:45:09.218
How do you know?

01:45:09.386 --> 01:45:11.595
Have you said, "Are you married?"

01:45:11.888 --> 01:45:14.473
No, I'm not going to-- No.

01:45:15.892 --> 01:45:19.270
KATHLEEN: I know this is a little late
to be asking but...

01:45:20.397 --> 01:45:21.897
...are you married?

01:45:25.402 --> 01:45:26.861
JOE:
Am I married?

01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:29.030
What kind of question is that?

01:45:29.573 --> 01:45:32.491
How can you ask me that?
Don't you know me at all?

01:45:32.743 --> 01:45:34.618
Oh, wait, I get it.

01:45:35.245 --> 01:45:38.581
Your friends are saying the reason
we haven't met is I'm married.

01:45:38.749 --> 01:45:40.249
Am I right?

01:45:41.585 --> 01:45:43.753
-So he didn't answer the question.
-Yes, he did.

01:45:44.046 --> 01:45:46.922
-He did not.
-He did. He did. He nailed me.

01:45:47.215 --> 01:45:51.093
He knew what I was after which is,
by the way, exactly like him.

01:45:51.386 --> 01:45:54.597
He did not answer the question, did he?

01:45:55.891 --> 01:45:57.266
No.

01:45:58.435 --> 01:46:00.644
Maybe he's fat.

01:46:01.313 --> 01:46:03.272
He's fat. He's a fatty.

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:05.066
I don't care.

01:46:05.233 --> 01:46:07.151
You don't care that he's so fat...

01:46:07.402 --> 01:46:11.113
...he has to be removed from his house
by a crane. You don't care.

01:46:11.281 --> 01:46:12.740
KATHLEEN:
That is very unlikely.

01:46:12.949 --> 01:46:15.284
That is completely ridiculous.

01:46:15.952 --> 01:46:17.787
What's his handle?

01:46:17.954 --> 01:46:19.288
Uh....

01:46:21.083 --> 01:46:22.583
I'm not going to write him.

01:46:22.793 --> 01:46:24.835
You think I'm going to e-mail him?

01:46:27.130 --> 01:46:28.756
All right, N-Y-1 -5-2.

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:31.634
N-Y-1-5-2? 152.

01:46:31.927 --> 01:46:34.053
He's 152 years old.

01:46:34.805 --> 01:46:37.556
He's had 152 moles removed...

01:46:37.808 --> 01:46:40.684
...so now he's got
152 pockmarks on his....

01:46:41.353 --> 01:46:42.978
On his face.

01:46:43.313 --> 01:46:46.774
The number of people who think
he looks like Clark Gable.

01:46:47.067 --> 01:46:50.861
152 people who think
he looks like a Clark Bar.

01:46:51.446 --> 01:46:53.322
[KATHLEEN LAUGHS]

01:46:54.825 --> 01:46:58.411
KATHLEEN: Why'd I even tell you?
-152 stitches from his nose job.

01:46:58.662 --> 01:47:01.705
The number of his souvenir
shot glasses...

01:47:01.957 --> 01:47:05.459
...that he's collected in his travels.

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:07.962
His address.

01:47:08.213 --> 01:47:12.091
No, he would never do
anything that prosaic.

01:47:16.138 --> 01:47:19.181
The only thing I
really care about is that...

01:47:19.391 --> 01:47:22.560
...aside from the married thing
and the jail thing...

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:25.271
...is the boat thing.

01:47:26.106 --> 01:47:27.148
What boat thing?

01:47:27.315 --> 01:47:29.608
I could never be
with someone who had a boat.

01:47:31.319 --> 01:47:32.778
I have a boat.

01:47:33.572 --> 01:47:35.156
Oh.

01:47:35.323 --> 01:47:37.908
Which clinches it.
We'll never be together.

01:47:38.243 --> 01:47:39.827
-How many?
-Three.

01:47:40.078 --> 01:47:41.454
-Allow me.
-Thank you.

01:47:41.663 --> 01:47:45.291
I could never be with someone
who likes Joni Mitchell.

01:47:45.542 --> 01:47:48.586
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

01:47:48.795 --> 01:47:52.214
What does that mean? Is she a pilot?

01:47:52.424 --> 01:47:55.259
It must be a metaphor,
but I don't know what it is.

01:47:57.012 --> 01:47:58.387
JOE:
How's your book coming?

01:47:58.638 --> 01:48:01.474
KATHLEEN: There's this
children's book editor I know.

01:48:01.725 --> 01:48:04.435
She's excited to read it
when I'm finished.

01:48:04.644 --> 01:48:06.937
Who would ever have thought
that I would write?

01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:09.523
-If I hadn't had all this time....
-Uh-huh.

01:48:10.442 --> 01:48:11.859
-You know what?
-What?

01:48:12.402 --> 01:48:16.530
The truth is he was the one who
started me thinking about writing.

01:48:17.657 --> 01:48:20.993
Mr. 152 Felony Indictments.

01:48:22.037 --> 01:48:25.581
Mr. 152 Insights Into My Soul.

01:48:25.749 --> 01:48:28.000
Oh. Whoa. Yeah. Oh.

01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:30.294
No competing with that.

01:48:32.881 --> 01:48:35.090
I keep on bumping into you.

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:38.135
Hope your mango's ripe.

01:48:39.137 --> 01:48:40.638
I think it is.

01:48:41.223 --> 01:48:43.349
You want to bump into me...

01:48:43.725 --> 01:48:45.976
...on Saturday around lunchtime?

01:48:46.144 --> 01:48:47.728
-Yeah.
-Over there?

01:48:47.896 --> 01:48:49.855
-Uh-huh.
-Good.

01:48:54.444 --> 01:48:56.820
JOE:
How about meeting...

01:48:57.072 --> 01:48:58.989
...Saturday?

01:48:59.908 --> 01:49:01.700
Four o'clock.

01:49:02.077 --> 01:49:04.328
There's a place in Riverside Park
at 91st Street...

01:49:04.496 --> 01:49:07.248
...where the path curves
and there's a garden.

01:49:07.499 --> 01:49:09.875
Brinkley and I will be waiting.

01:49:10.544 --> 01:49:11.835
Okay, let's do it.

01:49:12.087 --> 01:49:13.712
Ready? And....

01:49:13.964 --> 01:49:15.214
Doot.

01:49:15.382 --> 01:49:16.757
There it goes.

01:49:17.759 --> 01:49:19.635
-Today?
-Today.

01:49:19.803 --> 01:49:20.803
Wow.

01:49:20.971 --> 01:49:23.347
I know. In Riverside Park.

01:49:24.766 --> 01:49:26.767
That would mean he's a Westsider.

01:49:26.977 --> 01:49:29.687
Maybe I've seen him
and don't even know it.

01:49:29.896 --> 01:49:32.147
JOE: You could have seen him every day
and not know it.

01:49:32.357 --> 01:49:33.691
KATHLEEN:
It's very possible.

01:49:33.858 --> 01:49:35.818
-He could be anyone.
-He could be that guy.

01:49:35.986 --> 01:49:37.987
And those flowers are for you.

01:49:39.656 --> 01:49:42.074
JOE: Could be the Zipper Man.
-Who's that?

01:49:42.325 --> 01:49:43.534
The Zipper Man.

01:49:43.827 --> 01:49:44.827
Who is that?

01:49:44.995 --> 01:49:47.496
He repairs zippers
on Amsterdam Avenue.

01:49:47.706 --> 01:49:51.166
-Will you cut it out?
-You'd never have to buy new luggage.

[KATHLEEN CHUCKLES]

01:49:52.919 --> 01:49:56.839
The timing here is everything.
He's waited until you're primed.

01:49:57.007 --> 01:49:58.007
See?

01:49:58.174 --> 01:50:02.845
Until you are absolutely convinced
that there's no other man...

01:50:03.054 --> 01:50:05.180
...that you could possibly love.

01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:06.807
Yes.

01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:09.518
You know, sometimes I wonder.

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:11.061
What?

01:50:14.524 --> 01:50:16.191
If I hadn't been Fox Books...

01:50:16.401 --> 01:50:19.612
...and you hadn't been
The Shop Around the Corner...

01:50:20.405 --> 01:50:22.740
...and you and I had just met.

01:50:23.325 --> 01:50:26.410
-I know.
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:50:27.037 --> 01:50:29.079
I'd have asked for your number.

01:50:30.874 --> 01:50:35.419
I wouldn't have been able to wait 24 hours
before calling you and saying:

01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:39.882
"How about some coffee...

01:50:40.091 --> 01:50:42.259
...or drinks or dinner...

01:50:42.552 --> 01:50:43.969
...or a movie...

01:50:45.096 --> 01:50:47.640
...for as long as we both shall live?"

01:50:51.978 --> 01:50:53.062
Joe--

01:50:53.229 --> 01:50:55.773
You and I would never have been at war.

01:50:56.650 --> 01:51:01.236
The only thing we'd fight about would be
which video to rent on a Saturday night.

01:51:04.407 --> 01:51:05.866
Who fights about that?

01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:08.577
Some people.

01:51:09.913 --> 01:51:10.913
Not us.

01:51:11.289 --> 01:51:13.082
We would never.

01:51:17.754 --> 01:51:18.921
If only.

01:51:24.302 --> 01:51:27.304
-I gotta go.
-Let me ask you something.

01:51:32.102 --> 01:51:35.813
How can you forgive this guy
for standing you up...

01:51:36.022 --> 01:51:39.274
...and not forgive me
for this tiny little thing...

01:51:40.652 --> 01:51:42.945
...of putting you out of business?

01:51:48.284 --> 01:51:49.618
How I wish you would.

01:51:52.455 --> 01:51:53.831
I really have to go.

01:51:54.124 --> 01:51:55.916
You don't want to be late.

Don't cry.

01:54:19.435 --> 01:54:20.978
I wanted it to be you.

01:54:23.147 --> 01:54:25.566
