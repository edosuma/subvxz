01:16.167 --> 01:18.300
<i>Last week on
Married With Children,</i>

01:18.334 --> 01:19.567
<i>the Bundys went on vacation,</i>

01:19.601 --> 01:22.667
<i>and got stranded
in Lucifer, New Mexico.</i>

01:24.467 --> 01:26.166
<i>They met an old prospector</i>

01:26.200 --> 01:28.099
<i>who offered to trade them
his gold mine</i>

01:28.133 --> 01:30.300
<i>for the family's old Dodge.</i>

01:30.334 --> 01:32.433
Dodge is
a damn fine car.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.400
Ran over my wife
with a Dodge.

01:35.434 --> 01:37.266
<i>Then the prospector
warned them</i>

01:37.300 --> 01:39.999
<i>gold can turn families
against each other.</i>

01:40.033 --> 01:41.400
So it'd be just like
my life now,

01:41.434 --> 01:42.900
except I'd have gold
in both fists,

01:42.934 --> 01:44.467
and I'd be saying
"Yippee, yippee."

01:44.501 --> 01:46.800
<i>With Al's car, and
Marcie's and Jefferson's money,</i>

01:46.834 --> 01:49.366
<i>they bought the mine and
set out to strike it rich.</i>

01:49.400 --> 01:51.366
<i>Well, the plot's simple enough.</i>

01:51.400 --> 01:54.600
<i>And now, Married
With Children continues.</i>

02:04.601 --> 02:05.567
See, son...

02:05.601 --> 02:07.433
I saved us
some money already.

02:07.467 --> 02:10.101
We didn't need
no pack mules.

02:18.934 --> 02:21.133
Could somebody
help us out?

02:21.167 --> 02:22.500
Well, sure, honey.

02:22.534 --> 02:24.800
Come on, you can
make it!
Come on.

02:24.834 --> 02:25.834
Go!

02:25.868 --> 02:27.300
Come on! You can do it!

02:27.334 --> 02:29.300
Hurry it up now!
Just a couple more steps!

02:29.334 --> 02:31.300
Thattaway!
There you go!

02:31.334 --> 02:33.333
Hey, all right.
That wasn't so tough.

02:33.367 --> 02:35.500
Now, let's unpack
all these picks and shovels,

02:35.534 --> 02:37.900
and the rest of this
western crap...

02:37.934 --> 02:39.433
and start digging!

02:39.467 --> 02:40.633
Daddy, it is so hot,

02:40.667 --> 02:42.967
you could lay an egg
on the sidewalk.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.567
Look, Al...we just
got done lugging

02:49.601 --> 02:52.567
all the mining supplies,
plus your necessities.

02:52.601 --> 02:56.401
You know, two 12-packs
of Aurora white...

02:57.100 --> 02:58.600
a newspaper,

02:58.634 --> 03:01.734
and the Preparation H
with sunscreen.

03:03.434 --> 03:04.834
We want a rest.

03:04.868 --> 03:06.033
Rest?

03:06.067 --> 03:07.400
There's still
three hours of--

03:07.434 --> 03:09.467
Of 100,000-degree
daylight left.

03:09.501 --> 03:11.700
Now, come on, let's go to work.
Let's go to work.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.200
Let's go, Marcie.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.600
There's gold
in them thar hills.

03:14.634 --> 03:16.200
Let's get off
our duffs.

03:16.234 --> 03:17.767
Thank you,
honey.

03:17.801 --> 03:21.234
Now, would you bend over
and give me a target?

03:22.100 --> 03:23.533
You know, Al,
I've been thinking.

03:23.567 --> 03:25.533
I believe we should
all just take a little rest.

03:25.567 --> 03:28.101
Oh. You tenderfeet.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.934
Do you realize
where we're standing?

03:30.968 --> 03:32.433
Well, I don't know
about us,

03:32.467 --> 03:35.700
but you're standing
in coyote doodie.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.867
Aside from that.

03:38.901 --> 03:40.366
Now, look here.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.867
We're in the wild,
wild West.

03:42.901 --> 03:44.934
And I wanna see a little
pioneer spirit.

03:44.968 --> 03:46.999
I wanna see me
a little gumption.

03:47.033 --> 03:49.266
I wanna see me
a little-- Ladybug.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.067
Get it off me.
Get it off me!

04:00.701 --> 04:02.999
Now, look here.

04:03.033 --> 04:04.467
I'm sick of
your female whining.

04:04.501 --> 04:06.600
Yeah!
Yeah!

04:07.334 --> 04:09.400
Now, we have a chance
to get rich here.

04:09.434 --> 04:10.633
He who dares, wins.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.467
He who seeks, finds.

04:12.501 --> 04:14.667
He who digs...

04:14.701 --> 04:16.366
golds.

04:16.399 --> 04:17.899
Now, Peg...

04:17.934 --> 04:19.333
we've seen it
with our own eyes.

04:19.367 --> 04:21.099
There's nuggets
in this here mine

04:21.132 --> 04:23.500
as big as your mother's behind.

04:25.634 --> 04:27.400
And-- And just like
your mother's behind,

04:27.434 --> 04:29.401
it's there for the taking...

04:30.300 --> 04:33.800
by anyone with the courage
to reach out and grab it.

04:36.133 --> 04:38.600
Now, I feels like
getting rich.

04:38.634 --> 04:41.433
How many of you mangy
varmints are with me?

04:41.467 --> 04:43.567
I'm with you!

04:43.601 --> 04:44.600
Let's go!
Come on.

04:44.634 --> 04:45.667
Okay. Okay!

04:45.701 --> 04:47.600
Pull that
cup down.

04:47.634 --> 04:49.266
All right, good.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.633
Now, if anybody needs me,

04:50.667 --> 04:54.201
I, uh...got a little work
to do myself.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.867
Would you
look at him?

05:05.901 --> 05:07.633
And we followed
him.

05:07.667 --> 05:09.366
What were
we thinking?

05:09.400 --> 05:11.834
He's never found
anything, you know.

05:11.868 --> 05:14.667
Not even change
in the street.

05:14.701 --> 05:18.334
He can barely find his ear
with his finger.

05:19.634 --> 05:21.166
Yeah.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.533
Or chew gum
at the same time.

05:28.634 --> 05:31.201
Should she be
out in the sun?

05:32.467 --> 05:35.433
Hey, Peg, look!
It's a flip-top lid!

05:35.467 --> 05:37.834
It was in there.

05:40.334 --> 05:42.900
Good, baby.

05:42.934 --> 05:46.001
Uh, I am dying
of thirst.

05:48.767 --> 05:50.099
Ah.

05:50.133 --> 05:51.400
Anyone else want
some water?

05:51.434 --> 05:54.167
It's not water.
It's sweat.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.401
Eureka.

06:01.133 --> 06:03.099
O, mighty one
in the heavens,

06:03.133 --> 06:05.967
who created the mountains,
the seas and beer...

06:07.968 --> 06:09.600
40 years of
plague and darkness,

06:09.634 --> 06:11.333
and now finally a light.

06:11.367 --> 06:13.300
A golden light.

06:13.334 --> 06:15.767
It's gold.

06:16.868 --> 06:18.567
What'd you find,
Al?

06:18.601 --> 06:20.800
Nothing.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.099
You know, this may be
just a hunchback,

06:26.133 --> 06:29.434
but I think
Daddy found something.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.633
Oh, my--

06:32.968 --> 06:34.433
It's gold,
all right!
Oh, my--

06:34.467 --> 06:36.266
The bozo found gold!

06:36.300 --> 06:37.800
We're rich!

06:41.367 --> 06:43.333
Get out of
there!

06:43.367 --> 06:44.400
Hey. What
are you doing?

06:44.434 --> 06:47.401
Hey, hey!
I found it first!

06:54.968 --> 06:57.033
It's so good to be
alone with you, baby.

06:57.067 --> 07:01.767
Oh. I could hold you
like this forever.

07:12.067 --> 07:15.101
This is for the apartment.

07:17.167 --> 07:19.201
This is for the Corvette.

07:20.501 --> 07:23.567
And this is
for Miss February.

07:30.634 --> 07:32.267
Is this gold?

07:32.834 --> 07:34.166
N- no, honey.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.334
Darn it, I haven't
found any real gold.

07:38.334 --> 07:40.101
I'll take that!
Hey!

07:44.968 --> 07:47.500
I- if we found this much
in three hours,

07:47.534 --> 07:49.233
imagine how much
we'll find tomorrow.

07:49.267 --> 07:51.834
<i>Oh, God!
We're actually rich.</i>

07:51.868 --> 07:54.467
What are you gonna do
with your share, Marcie?

07:54.501 --> 07:57.134
I'm gonna share mine
with the poor.

07:59.567 --> 08:00.900
No, really.

08:00.934 --> 08:02.300
What are you gonna
do with yours?

08:02.334 --> 08:04.333
I'm gonna buy
a seal coat,

08:04.367 --> 08:06.700
a diamond car
with condor floor mats,

08:06.734 --> 08:08.600
and a bald eagle hat.

08:10.300 --> 08:11.300
What about you,
honey?

08:11.334 --> 08:13.966
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.767
I have everything
I want, and...

08:17.434 --> 08:18.934
everyone I want.

08:18.968 --> 08:20.667
Hm.

08:22.734 --> 08:23.999
By the way...

08:24.033 --> 08:26.667
would you be upset if
I got a place of my own?

08:29.601 --> 08:31.101
Hey, Dad.

08:31.734 --> 08:33.368
I know what I'm gonna do.

08:33.667 --> 08:34.667
I'm gonna get me
a place

08:34.701 --> 08:37.033
right next to the old
Playboy Mansion.

08:37.067 --> 08:39.767
You know, Hef's parties might
have died down by now,

08:39.801 --> 08:41.966
but, uh, he can still
sneak over the fence

08:42.000 --> 08:44.368
and get some young stuff
at Club Bud.

08:45.067 --> 08:48.500
Here, let me get that
spittle for you, son.

08:48.834 --> 08:49.800
Kelly.

08:49.834 --> 08:52.133
What about you,
dear?

08:52.167 --> 08:53.900
Is this gold?

08:54.701 --> 08:56.201
No, pumpkin.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.867
I'll take that too, Peg!
No, no. I got it! No!

09:01.234 --> 09:03.301
My eye! All right!
My eye!

09:04.367 --> 09:05.867
Oh, Peg. Ahh!

09:08.367 --> 09:10.467
What about you, Peggy?
What are you going to do?

09:10.501 --> 09:11.800
Oh, I don't know. I--

09:11.834 --> 09:14.134
Probably make
a few changes. Ha-ha.

09:37.067 --> 09:38.467
SorryI'm late.

09:38.501 --> 09:40.166
Oh, that's all right,
sweetheart.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.667
Just take your shirt off
and put it on the moose head.

09:58.601 --> 10:00.366
You know, maybe, uh,

10:00.400 --> 10:02.700
redecorate or something.

10:03.868 --> 10:05.567
What about you, honey?

10:06.367 --> 10:07.934
Honey?

10:22.801 --> 10:25.700
And so...that's how
I defeated the robots

10:25.734 --> 10:28.867
in the first intergalactic
Super Bowl.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.733
So, what do you wanna
do now, girls?

10:32.767 --> 10:34.767
We'd just like
to serve you,

10:34.801 --> 10:36.533
beautiful
one.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.033
Well...what's
on the menu?

10:42.067 --> 10:43.600
Massage?

10:43.634 --> 10:45.700
Whipped cream bath?

10:47.434 --> 10:49.600
Spanking?

10:51.601 --> 10:53.600
Horsy ride?

10:56.100 --> 10:58.033
Or shall we go back
in our cages

10:58.067 --> 10:59.867
and frug for you again?

11:01.033 --> 11:02.233
Well, girls...

11:02.267 --> 11:04.201
it's your dream.

11:05.767 --> 11:07.567
Sorry I'm late.

11:07.601 --> 11:09.633
Oh, that's
all right, dear.

11:09.667 --> 11:12.800
Just hang up your robe
on the moose head.

11:36.067 --> 11:37.800
Oh, you know me, Peg.

11:37.834 --> 11:40.834
I probably won't even
get off the couch.

11:42.901 --> 11:44.934
Hey.
I have an idea.

11:44.968 --> 11:46.633
How about if
we all put

11:46.667 --> 11:48.166
our gold together
in one sack,

11:48.200 --> 11:51.067
and then we divvy it up
when we get home?

11:51.634 --> 11:53.667
Gee, that's a great idea
for you, Kelly.

11:53.701 --> 11:55.467
You have nothing.

11:55.501 --> 11:56.867
Yeah. I work
harder than you.

11:56.901 --> 11:58.966
Why shouldIgive you
my gold?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.500
Because...

12:00.534 --> 12:02.300
I'm your daughter.

12:02.334 --> 12:05.066
Well, y-- And you always
will be, pumpkin, but...

12:05.100 --> 12:07.034
you ain't gonna
have no gold.

12:08.834 --> 12:09.800
Hey, Dad.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.433
Didn't that
old prospector

12:11.467 --> 12:12.834
warn us all about greed?

12:12.868 --> 12:15.033
Fine. Then you give Kelly
some of your gold.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.167
Yeah.

12:18.300 --> 12:21.034
Catch you
at the mission, babe.

12:22.067 --> 12:24.800
All right. Look.
Here's what we should do.

12:24.834 --> 12:27.433
Some of us are obviously working
harder than others.

12:27.467 --> 12:30.633
So I say what everybody finds,
everybody keeps.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.567
We're all responsible
for our own goods.

12:32.601 --> 12:33.733
That makes
sense.

12:33.767 --> 12:35.066
Well said, honey.

12:35.100 --> 12:38.001
Touch my gold again,
and I'll slap you silly.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.468
All right, let's
all turn in.
All right.

12:54.367 --> 12:55.400
Ah! Ah!

12:55.434 --> 12:57.734
Oh.

13:03.801 --> 13:06.134
Must have been
a coyote.

13:06.934 --> 13:09.167
Yeah.

13:09.968 --> 13:12.200
Must have been.

13:12.234 --> 13:14.400
Good night.
Night.

13:14.434 --> 13:16.134
Good night.
Good night.

13:31.367 --> 13:33.101
Al.

13:34.334 --> 13:36.500
What?

13:38.267 --> 13:40.900
I think we should kill
Marcie and Jefferson.

13:44.501 --> 13:47.667
Peg, listen to what
you're saying.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.667
They can work for days
and gather more gold.

13:56.834 --> 13:57.934
And then...

13:57.968 --> 13:59.533
if they should
accidentally walk

13:59.567 --> 14:01.067
in front of my rifle...

14:04.267 --> 14:05.533
Oh, you're
so smart, honey.

14:05.567 --> 14:07.099
Yeah. Ah,
good night.
Good night.

14:07.133 --> 14:09.301
Good night.

14:12.067 --> 14:14.266
Al.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.533
What?

14:16.567 --> 14:18.867
I don't trust
the kids.

14:22.334 --> 14:25.200
What are you guys
talking about over there?

14:25.234 --> 14:27.966
Nothing. Nothing.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.533
You're not gonna
kill us, are you?

14:32.367 --> 14:34.733
Now, we wouldn't
do that.

14:34.767 --> 14:37.300
We love you.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.667
We love you
guys too. Huh.

14:40.701 --> 14:42.600
We gotta get
that shotgun

14:42.634 --> 14:44.134
away from Dad.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.233
We will. We will.

14:46.267 --> 14:49.667
All in due time.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.301
We love you guys!

15:02.367 --> 15:04.700
We're dead.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.934
Kelly...

15:27.968 --> 15:30.301
that's not
real gold.

15:30.901 --> 15:33.967
Darn it. I never get
any real gold.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.166
Get this away from me.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.767
Stupid.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.368
Al!

16:13.467 --> 16:15.066
What?

16:15.100 --> 16:16.767
There's a deadly
tarantula

16:16.801 --> 16:18.567
crawling on
your arm.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.934
Yeah, right.

16:25.968 --> 16:27.467
I get up to check,

16:27.501 --> 16:31.034
a shovel crushes
the back of my skull...

16:31.834 --> 16:34.333
and my gold is gone.

16:34.367 --> 16:37.600
I'm not falling
for that one, Peg.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.600
Okay, honey.
Good night.

16:43.634 --> 16:45.267
Good night.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.233
Peg...

17:12.267 --> 17:16.599
There's a tarantula on me.

17:17.367 --> 17:20.333
I need some help here.

17:20.367 --> 17:22.300
You didn't
believe me.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.500
<i>I'm not speaking
to you.</i>

17:25.501 --> 17:26.767
I believe you.
I believe you.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.567
Too late.

17:28.601 --> 17:30.767
Hey, what's going on?

17:32.367 --> 17:36.167
Daddy has a tarantula
on his arm.

17:36.868 --> 17:38.233
Wow! Look at
that thing.

17:38.267 --> 17:39.900
Dibs on Dad's gold!

17:39.934 --> 17:44.167
Hey. I know how
we could save Daddy.
Huh?

17:45.033 --> 17:46.733
Kelly.

17:46.767 --> 17:48.200
Don't.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.200
You might hurt
Daddy.

17:50.234 --> 17:51.834
We'll shoot it
off him.

17:51.868 --> 17:53.033
Yeah.

17:53.067 --> 17:55.467
Daddy...give us
your gun.

17:55.501 --> 17:57.966
No. But I'll give you
both barrels

17:58.000 --> 18:00.867
if you don't get
this monster off my arm...

18:00.901 --> 18:03.900
Oh. I'll take care
of this, you big baby.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.433
I can't believe it.
It's just a stupid spider.

18:07.467 --> 18:09.700
Oh, Peg.

18:13.701 --> 18:15.467
Oh! It's hot!
Oh, it's hot!

18:15.501 --> 18:16.467
Oh.
Oh, God!

18:16.501 --> 18:18.267
Get his gold!

18:21.067 --> 18:23.700
Gold! Gold!
Gold!

18:26.934 --> 18:28.133
Well, I guess we've

18:28.167 --> 18:29.200
played this mine out.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.233
Time to get our gold

18:30.267 --> 18:31.233
and go home.

18:31.267 --> 18:33.233
Ha-ha-ha.
Where's Daddy?

18:33.267 --> 18:34.767
Gee, I don't know. I--

18:34.801 --> 18:37.468
I haven't seen him
since he went insane.

18:39.434 --> 18:41.167
Here he comes.

18:42.634 --> 18:45.600
I killed this squirrel
for looking at my gold.

18:51.067 --> 18:53.333
Good work, Dad.

18:53.367 --> 18:54.433
Uh, Al...

18:54.467 --> 18:55.967
Hm?

18:58.334 --> 19:01.999
I think Dad's shoe-selling
days are just about over.

19:02.033 --> 19:03.999
<i>I think Dad's
shoe-wearing days</i>

19:04.033 --> 19:06.133
are just about over.

19:06.167 --> 19:07.433
Y- you know...

19:07.467 --> 19:10.200
we can't very well
take him home like this...

19:10.234 --> 19:11.266
can we?

19:11.300 --> 19:13.033
Huh. I-I know
I'm the new guy,

19:13.067 --> 19:14.867
but if I have a vote...

19:14.901 --> 19:16.533
I'd say kill him.

19:16.567 --> 19:17.533
I heard that!

19:17.567 --> 19:19.267
It wasn't me,
it was Marcie!

19:20.467 --> 19:22.800
You all thinkI'm nuts!
But I'm not!

19:22.834 --> 19:24.767
Hold on, mister!
Don't move!

19:24.801 --> 19:26.334
Ho!

19:29.467 --> 19:33.500
Well, it's not like
he was once a whole man.

19:34.167 --> 19:35.734
Claim jumpers!
Oh.

19:36.934 --> 19:37.900
The old
prospector

19:37.934 --> 19:39.233
warned us
about these guys.

19:39.267 --> 19:41.034
Huh. Just act
natural.

19:43.367 --> 19:45.667
What are you people
doing here?

19:45.701 --> 19:46.667
Hm?

19:46.701 --> 19:47.934
We're, uh--

19:47.968 --> 19:50.066
We're seeing
America.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.667
We're loving each other.

19:53.033 --> 19:54.567
What do you want?

19:54.601 --> 19:55.767
Well, this is
the third stop

19:55.801 --> 19:57.767
on the Hell Hole
National Park tour.

19:57.801 --> 20:00.633
What kind of
exhibit is this?

20:01.667 --> 20:05.633
We can see these kind of
people in Miami.

20:06.601 --> 20:08.033
Don't worry,
folks.

20:08.067 --> 20:10.133
We'll clean out the Bigfoot
family in a second.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.433
Grab your pans

20:11.467 --> 20:14.200
and share the forty-niner
experience.

20:14.234 --> 20:16.900
Yeah? Grab your butts
and kiss 'em goodbye.

20:17.567 --> 20:19.333
We own this here mine.

20:19.367 --> 20:20.900
We bought it...

20:20.934 --> 20:23.033
from some old guy...

20:23.067 --> 20:24.667
Looked like John Byner.

20:26.801 --> 20:28.233
Oh, old Zeke.

20:28.267 --> 20:31.267
Is he still selling
fake mines to rubes?

20:31.801 --> 20:34.500
Look, son, this is
a national park.

20:34.534 --> 20:37.433
And what you've got there
is fool's gold.

20:37.467 --> 20:39.900
We salt the mines
for the rubes--

20:40.467 --> 20:41.533
Uh, tourists.

20:41.567 --> 20:43.099
But if it would
make you feel better,

20:43.133 --> 20:44.800
you can each carry
a nugget home...

20:44.834 --> 20:47.333
because fun and rocks
are what we're all about

20:47.367 --> 20:49.167
at Hell Hole
National Park.

20:52.067 --> 20:53.733
Thanks a lot,
Al.

20:53.767 --> 20:55.900
Four days
in this intense heat

20:55.934 --> 20:57.066
for nothing.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.900
You are truly
a numskull!

20:58.934 --> 21:00.667
Dimwit.
Total thief.

21:00.701 --> 21:01.667
Cretin!

21:01.701 --> 21:03.800
Bombastic simpleton.

21:05.767 --> 21:09.267
<i>And a bad, bad daddy.</i>

21:10.300 --> 21:13.934
We don't have any gold.

21:14.467 --> 21:16.368
Now, listen.
Listen.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.400
Now, I came here
to get real gold.

21:19.434 --> 21:20.467
And I ain't leaving

21:20.501 --> 21:22.800
till I get real gold.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.999
<i>Under the heading,
"Isn't that bizarre,"</i>

21:37.033 --> 21:39.133
<i>today's story comes

21:39.167 --> 21:41.233

21:57.634 --> 21:59.033

<i>unbathed</i>

22:01.968 --> 22:03.834

gang?

22:09.133 --> 22:11.900
Five after 3!
