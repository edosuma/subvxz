00:08.425 --> 00:09.843
Previously on
"The Lost Symbol..."

00:09.884 --> 00:11.011
Your husband shot me.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.679
He's not my husband anymore.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.305
(grunting)

00:14.347 --> 00:15.557
Let me see some ID.

00:15.598 --> 00:16.891
SATO:
First your brother,

00:16.933 --> 00:18.059
then your father.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.060
You could be next.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.353
This is crazy.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.397
LANGDON:
A psychopath is killing people

00:22.439 --> 00:24.024
to ensure that I keep going,

00:24.065 --> 00:26.317
and your Leviathan friends
are showing up in gas masks

00:26.359 --> 00:27.736
trying to get me to stop.

00:27.777 --> 00:30.405
But I can't stop,
not if I want to get Peter back.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.948
It's a piece of rock.

00:31.990 --> 00:32.991
It's a map.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.242
The pyramid and the capstone

00:34.284 --> 00:36.828
will reveal the location
of the portal.

00:46.004 --> 00:50.592
KNOPP:
So the bottom line is,
if this contract gets awarded

00:50.633 --> 00:52.427
it'll add 10,000 new jobs.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.846
And that's in Nevada alone.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.723
Every one of those

00:56.765 --> 00:58.683
is a future vote
the senator can count on.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.811
If those projections
are even accurate.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.021
CBO sees it differently.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.606
Your boss didn't get to be chair

01:04.647 --> 01:07.484
of the Armed Services Committee
by listening to the CBO.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.778
Now, I know she'd like
to keep that position,

01:09.819 --> 01:12.197
but she's gonna have
to get reelected first.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.449
If she pushes this
over the line,

01:14.491 --> 01:16.868
we'd be happy to ensure
she meets her fundraising goals.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.328
(door opens)

01:18.370 --> 01:19.954
SECRETARY: Sir?
Your next appointment is here.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.664
He's waiting in your office.

01:24.709 --> 01:25.877
Warren.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.837
Thanks for coming in.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.632
-How have you been?
-I've been well.

01:30.674 --> 01:33.301
Still dreaming of that
cracked crab down at Nags Head.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.886
(laughs) I'm glad.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.347
Nothing gives Emily and I
more pleasure

01:37.389 --> 01:39.849
than sharing that house
with people.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.852
So, I've been trying
to push through

01:42.894 --> 01:45.980
a piece of defense legislation,
and I could use your help.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.191
Well, unless somebody's
changed the Constitution

01:48.233 --> 01:49.693
when I wasn't looking,

01:49.734 --> 01:52.445
the Architect of the Capitol
doesn't get a vote.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.822
Well, I don't need your vote.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.031
I need your access.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.825
I need to know which way
people are leaning.

01:56.866 --> 01:59.786
You're asking me
to spy on Congress?

01:59.828 --> 02:01.329
And if I was?

02:01.371 --> 02:03.790
You would strenuously object,
of course,

02:03.832 --> 02:05.834
because that would mean
betraying your oath

02:05.875 --> 02:07.002
to a sacred institution.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.963
And you would never do that,
would you?

02:10.005 --> 02:14.342
Institutions are important.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.386
When individuals are weak,

02:16.428 --> 02:19.139
they ensure
the group remains strong.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.100
You understand that.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.519
At least, you used to.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.024
Leviathan exists
to protect a secret

02:29.065 --> 02:31.526
more important
than any one person's life.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.528
More important
than Peter Solomon's,

02:33.570 --> 02:35.530
certainly more
important than yours.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.866
"We protect it from those
who would do evil.

02:37.907 --> 02:41.244
We must ensure
the mystery remains unsolved."

02:41.286 --> 02:43.788
What do you want,
Jonathan?

02:43.830 --> 02:47.542
I want to know how far
Robert Langdon has gotten.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.805
"The secret hides
within The Order."

03:00.847 --> 03:03.683
"The Order," capitalized--
what Order?

03:03.725 --> 03:07.729
It can't just mean Freemasonry,
that'd be redundant.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.481
So what?

03:09.522 --> 03:11.900
The Carthusians?

03:11.941 --> 03:13.735
Too hermetic.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.363
Franciscans? Too familiar.

03:16.404 --> 03:19.574
Friend of mine forwarded me
the tox screens from Trish.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.995
She was drugged. Ketamine.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.246
Ketamine.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.998
That's like
a party drug, right?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.708
Used to be.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.294
People use it now for pain,
depression.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.630
Put people in a coma with it
sometimes.

03:33.672 --> 03:37.550
Point is, it's not easy to get.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.260
Unless you have a contact.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.887
Like a doctor?

03:40.929 --> 03:43.056
Or pharmacist.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.601
Sophie Bastin.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.728
The janitor's wife?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.439
You said you believed her.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.442
Well, maybe I just wanted
to believe her.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.654
I'm thinking
I should pay her another visit.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.544
Hey, anything book smart
happen in 1514?

04:12.585 --> 04:14.129
Not especially.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.132
Somewhere in the middle
of the War of the Holy League,

04:17.173 --> 04:19.467
Copernicus is finishing
his theory that the sun is,

04:19.509 --> 04:21.469
in fact, the center
of the universe. Why?

04:21.511 --> 04:23.430
Because the box is dated.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.473
1514 AD.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.939
"AD" isn't a date.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.820
It's a person.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.864
* *

04:54.961 --> 04:57.005
(coughing)

04:58.673 --> 05:00.884
(labored breathing)

05:04.471 --> 05:07.098
(coughing)

05:08.224 --> 05:09.976
(grunts softly)

05:11.561 --> 05:12.896
(sighs)

05:14.773 --> 05:16.733
(groans)

05:16.775 --> 05:18.818
(panting)

05:24.949 --> 05:26.117
(exhales sharply)

05:26.159 --> 05:28.244
MAL'AKH:
You're awake.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.580
If that's what you're wondering.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.169
You seem to be recovering well.

05:36.211 --> 05:39.506
Is that what this is?

05:39.547 --> 05:42.133
Post-op?

05:45.428 --> 05:47.847
If you're going to torture me,

05:47.889 --> 05:53.937
at least have the good grace
to do it while I'm awake.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.605
(sighs)

05:56.856 --> 06:00.402
I assume you have a reason
for all this?

06:00.443 --> 06:04.322
You'll understand soon enough.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.826
But first, a statement.

06:12.455 --> 06:16.084
Think of it as, uh, a lecture.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.545
If that helps.

06:22.007 --> 06:25.552
Why Robert?
He's not even a Freemason.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.972
He's in need
of your encouragement.

06:29.014 --> 06:34.019
There are others
who will never let him succeed.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.770
Leviathan?

06:37.147 --> 06:39.733
They don't concern me.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.904
(clicks tongue)
Well, they should.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.824
-I'm not reading this.
-You will.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.286
Or you will go back
into the tank

06:51.327 --> 06:54.164
to whatever awaits you there.

06:55.749 --> 06:59.627
A.D. stands for Albrecht Dürer.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.962
German. 16th century.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.756
In medieval art,

07:02.797 --> 07:06.718
initials were often drawn
this way.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.970
Symbols used
instead of signatures.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.765
He had
the ultimate Renaissance mind:

07:11.806 --> 07:14.309
artist, philosopher, alchemist,

07:14.351 --> 07:17.187
and lifelong student
of the ancient mysteries.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.190
So we're looking
for a painting he did in 1514.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.733
An engraving.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.694
-"Melencolia I."
-Creepy.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.780
Dense with symbolism.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.865
It represents
mankind's failed attempt

07:28.907 --> 07:31.117
to transform human intellect

07:31.159 --> 07:32.202
into godlike power.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.037
Like in the Rotunda.
"Apotheosis..."

07:34.079 --> 07:35.330
"Of Washington."

07:35.372 --> 07:36.873
Exactly.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.333
That's not a coincidence.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.502
And neither is that.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.003
A magic square.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.005
Dürer accomplished
what had seemed impossible.

07:44.047 --> 07:47.342
Every number added horizontally,
vertically,

07:47.384 --> 07:49.052
diagonally and quarterly,

07:49.094 --> 07:52.097
all equals the same number: 34.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.682
(voice-over):
My earlier decryption

07:53.723 --> 07:56.601
of the pyramid
gave us meaningless letters.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.228
Using the magic square,

07:58.269 --> 08:00.563
you see that the first box
is 16.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.566
That becomes "J."

08:03.608 --> 08:04.651
Second is three, that's an "E."

08:04.693 --> 08:06.361
Then two, "O."

08:06.403 --> 08:07.362
Next box, that's "S."

08:07.404 --> 08:10.240
11's "A." "N."

08:10.699 --> 08:14.994
U-N-U-S.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.124
"Jeova...

08:19.165 --> 08:21.334
"Sanctus...

08:21.376 --> 08:23.837
Unus."

08:23.878 --> 08:26.089
What does it mean?

08:26.131 --> 08:28.383
One true God.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.551
NUÑEZ:
All right, cool.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.970
I'm gonna let you
Harvard this out.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.264
I'm gonna go see
the janitor's wife.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.102
-Great. Yeah.
-All right. Okay.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.148
(door opens)

08:43.189 --> 08:45.775
-(door closes)
-(phone vibrates)

08:56.202 --> 09:01.124
Robert, my time is running out.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.836
If you fail to locate
the portal,

09:04.878 --> 09:07.922
it won't be my hand you find,

09:07.964 --> 09:10.300
but my head.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.396
(sighs)

09:30.653 --> 09:33.156
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:35.367 --> 09:39.120
PETER:
He understands, Nare-uh-thack...
that...

09:39.162 --> 09:42.415
the present situation
is unsustainable.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.833
Ness no...

09:43.875 --> 09:47.253
he knows government personnel
are involved,

09:47.295 --> 09:49.589
and the time he needs
to get from you

09:49.631 --> 09:51.508
what he wants is waning.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.967
Act quickly.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.844
And do not prok...

09:54.886 --> 09:57.639
do not provoke contact
with others on this,

09:57.681 --> 09:58.890
or...

09:58.932 --> 10:03.061
this communication
may be my last.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.287
I went back and forth over
whether I should even show you.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.456
No, it's good.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.709
He's alive.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.879
There's something else
I wanted you to see.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.514
Is that...

10:39.556 --> 10:41.474
The capstone.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.769
Um...

10:44.811 --> 10:46.604
it came in a... in a stone box,

10:46.646 --> 10:50.817
and there was an inscription on
it that led me to an engraving,

10:50.859 --> 10:52.569
-"Melencolia I."
-I know that piece.

10:52.610 --> 10:55.321
Dad used to point it out on our
trips to the National Gallery.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.907
Do you, do you remember
any-anything he said about it?

10:59.325 --> 11:03.455
Did he... did he ever mention
the phrase "one true god"?

11:04.289 --> 11:07.083
I don't think so,
not specifically.

11:07.125 --> 11:10.587
I wish he was here to tell me
what makes it so important.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.672
Maybe I need to go and see it.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.883
There could be something hidden
in the actual engraving

11:14.924 --> 11:16.509
that you can't see
in a photo online.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.887
I could go with you.
I might remember something.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.723
-It's risky. It's risky
us even being here together.
-Look, Dad said

11:21.765 --> 11:24.392
that time was running out.
We have to finish this,

11:24.434 --> 11:27.354
-and two people
can do that better than one.
-SATO: She's right.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.357
Whoa.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.778
Heard you left the house
in a rush.

11:34.819 --> 11:35.904
Thought you might need help.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.781
Well, I don't.

11:38.865 --> 11:42.035
Wha... Wha-What's going on here?
Why is she here?

11:42.077 --> 11:44.079
She has some ideas
about who took Dad.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.581
And she helped me
with something at the lab.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.416
I think we can trust her.

11:48.458 --> 11:52.253
Warren told me the CIA
is looking for the portal, too.

11:52.295 --> 11:55.965
The CIA looks
for a lot of things.

11:56.007 --> 11:58.677
I could just take
what you've got in that bag

11:58.718 --> 12:02.889
and walk it over to Langley, if
that's how I wanted to play it.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.266
But it's not.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.310
Why else would you want to go
to the museum with me?

12:07.352 --> 12:10.772
If anything goes wrong,
I have something you need.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.315
What's that?

12:12.357 --> 12:14.150
A gun.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.497
(sighs)

12:46.182 --> 12:48.685
(door opens in distance)

12:48.727 --> 12:50.854
(door closes)

13:00.822 --> 13:02.365
(other engine starts)

13:02.407 --> 13:03.450
(clears throat)

13:19.799 --> 13:22.052
* *

13:34.064 --> 13:36.608
MAL'AKH:
The shivering is normal.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.361
You've been
to a very cold place.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.696
Hell is not a burning pit.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.448
No, in truth, it's...

13:43.490 --> 13:44.908
so very cold.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.910
What was the goal?

13:46.951 --> 13:49.662
The goal is clarity.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.546
Did you see him in the Araf?

14:00.465 --> 14:05.261
Did you live out
your poor son's death?

14:07.931 --> 14:10.558
You don't have to feel guilty.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.352
No.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.188
(chuckles softly)

14:15.230 --> 14:18.024
Death was a blessing for him.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.902
And all this you did...

14:20.944 --> 14:23.947
to find the ancient wisdom.

14:25.657 --> 14:30.453
Tell me what you think
this will bring you in the end.

14:31.204 --> 14:35.959
What did it bring
the Adepts of ancient Egypt?

14:38.503 --> 14:42.507
I will move as a god
among the masses.

14:42.549 --> 14:47.178
I will return us
to the days of the Old Kingdom.

14:47.971 --> 14:51.808
I will initiate the worthy...

14:51.850 --> 14:54.102
and destroy the weak.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.909
Excuse me,
the Albrecht Dürer exhibit?

15:09.951 --> 15:12.162
Oh, I got it. Thank you.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.594
(indistinct chatter)

15:38.646 --> 15:40.774
That's some coincidence.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.199
Let's go.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.331
Little faster.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.708
Hey, wouldn't we be safer
in the crowd?

15:58.750 --> 16:01.378
The crowd wouldn't be.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.182
Take it easy, Professor.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.975
Where's your friend?

16:16.017 --> 16:17.769
(grunting)

16:17.811 --> 16:19.562
Langdon, run!

16:21.022 --> 16:23.274
(grunting)

16:24.234 --> 16:26.069
-(yells)
-Go!

16:27.654 --> 16:29.364
(tires screech)

16:30.907 --> 16:32.075
Get in!

16:36.746 --> 16:38.456
(tires squeal)

16:45.422 --> 16:47.716
KATHERINE:
So these guys were part
of your group?

16:47.757 --> 16:49.843
They were Leviathan?

16:49.884 --> 16:51.219
Yes.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.638
I'm sorry I put you
in this position.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.223
It was my choice.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.308
It takes a while sometimes
to decide

16:57.350 --> 16:59.686
where one's loyalties lie.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.104
Warren.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.651
Thank you.

17:10.447 --> 17:13.074
I don't know what we'd do
without you.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.993
Well, I guess
you're gonna find out.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.870
I have to go.

17:16.911 --> 17:17.996
Where?

17:18.038 --> 17:19.914
Somewhere far away

17:19.956 --> 17:22.292
until this blows over.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.674
Be safe.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.385
You, too.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.480
We could offer you protection.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.939
No.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.108
If I stay, they'll find me.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.277
And they know how
to find anyone.

17:49.319 --> 17:52.947
I appreciate you
not saying anything to her

17:52.989 --> 17:54.866
about Zachary.

17:54.908 --> 17:59.412
I hope you get what
you're looking for in all this,

17:59.454 --> 18:03.375
not only for your sake
but for theirs.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.504
(phone ringing)

18:11.800 --> 18:13.635
Sato.

18:13.677 --> 18:15.011
We're fine.

18:15.053 --> 18:18.348
I'm with Langdon and Katherine
at Solomon's house.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.434
There's no need.
I can handle it.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.856
I understand.

18:31.194 --> 18:34.030
Robert,
my time is running out.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.782
(taps keyboard)

18:47.711 --> 18:48.795
Hey.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.755
Maybe you
should stop watching that?

18:50.797 --> 18:53.133
Dad used to play this game
with me.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.509
He would talk backwards,

18:54.551 --> 18:56.428
and then I'd try to guess
what he was saying.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.138
I always knew
the game had started

18:58.179 --> 19:00.390
when he said my name.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.434
And listen.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.728
He understands, Nare-uh-thack...

19:04.769 --> 19:06.396
That's "Katherine" backwards.

19:06.438 --> 19:07.897
(backwards):
Katherine...

19:08.690 --> 19:11.401
So he could have planted clues
in the audio?

19:11.443 --> 19:13.319
Mm-hmm. Here.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.864
PETER:
...situation is unsustainable.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.032
Ness no...

19:17.073 --> 19:18.199
(backwards):
On ssen...

19:18.241 --> 19:19.492
"On sen."

19:19.534 --> 19:21.870
Something sounds familiar
about that.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.748
In Japanese,
onsen is a term for hot springs.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.750
-Hot springs.
-Right.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.793
He could be trying to tell us
something about the geography.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.795
Yeah, like where he's
being held, near hot springs.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.214
-West Virginia, maybe.
-This is a long shot, you know?

19:33.256 --> 19:35.467
Maybe, but worth investigating.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.885
We don't have time.

19:36.926 --> 19:40.055
My boss knows
what happened at the museum.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.182
He's worried Leviathan
could come for those.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.850
He's told me to bring them in

19:43.892 --> 19:45.685
so our analysts
can try to crack it.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.228
KATHERINE:
You can't do that.

19:47.270 --> 19:50.065
If you do that and Mal'akh
finds out, my dad is dead.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.776
If I don't check in soon,
the Agency will send people,

19:52.817 --> 19:54.694
-and they won't be nice like me.
-There has to be another way.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.696
The other way is
to solve this thing

19:56.738 --> 19:58.573
and give Mal'akh
the answers he wants, but...

19:58.615 --> 20:00.742
without more time,

20:00.784 --> 20:02.786
I don't know how to get them.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.913
Damn it.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.540
But he doesn't know that.

20:08.917 --> 20:12.087
He doesn't know
you're at an impasse.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.922
We can fake it.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.841
-What does that mean?
-Robert tells him
he's figured out

20:16.883 --> 20:20.679
the location of the portal
and arranges a drop.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.348
A drop. So then I meet him,

20:23.390 --> 20:25.975
and, uh, what,
I'm supposed to lie?

20:26.017 --> 20:27.268
Do what you're good at.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.895
Tell him a story.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.980
Keep him occupied
while we extract Peter.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.526
You'd be going against orders.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.612
Sometimes
it takes a while to decide

20:37.654 --> 20:40.365
where one's loyalties lie.

20:41.157 --> 20:45.078
I'll keep it stripped down,
bring in one person I trust,

20:45.120 --> 20:46.496
-no more.
-Maybe one more:

20:46.538 --> 20:48.915
someone I trust.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.845
(phone vibrating)

21:03.054 --> 21:04.764
(sighs)

21:08.810 --> 21:10.812
-Hello?
-Hey. It's Robert.

21:10.854 --> 21:13.398
Langdon? I almost didn't answer.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.400
-Where are you? You okay?
-Yeah.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.818
Yeah, this is Sato's phone.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.195
-Say what?
-I'm with her and Katherine.

21:19.237 --> 21:20.780
Things have escalated.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.782
Did you find anything
on your end?

21:22.824 --> 21:24.617
Nah, I searched the whole house.

21:24.659 --> 21:26.161
This place is a bust.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.079
Okay, well...

21:28.121 --> 21:31.082
Sato has a plan-- it could be
dangerous, so I won't blame you

21:31.124 --> 21:33.835
-if you don't want to be
a part of it.
-No, I'm part of it.

21:33.877 --> 21:36.296
-What do you need me to do?
-We're gonna set an exchange

21:36.338 --> 21:37.380
to get Peter back.

21:37.422 --> 21:38.798
Can you meet us?

21:38.840 --> 21:41.801
-I'll text you the address.
-Leaving now.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.179
(floor creaks)

21:44.220 --> 21:45.347
(grunts)

21:45.388 --> 21:47.807
(objects clatter)

21:50.393 --> 21:51.853
(camera clicks)

21:55.482 --> 21:57.609
I have...

21:57.650 --> 21:59.444
the answers.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.530
I want Peter.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.452
(beeps)

22:12.165 --> 22:13.958
How's the arm?

22:16.086 --> 22:17.587
Fine, thanks.

22:20.507 --> 22:22.550
I didn't know
you two knew each other.

22:22.592 --> 22:25.178
Oh, yeah, we go way back.

22:32.310 --> 22:34.562
(phone vibrating)

22:45.031 --> 22:47.575
-Yes?
-MAL'AKH: I'll be
at 57 Caelian Street

22:47.617 --> 22:49.744
in two hours.

22:49.786 --> 22:52.747
You bring your answers.

22:54.666 --> 22:57.794
Have him ready to go
in 90 minutes.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.799
(phone vibrating)

23:07.303 --> 23:09.305
Is everything all right?

23:09.347 --> 23:11.766
Cop from the Capitol came back.

23:15.353 --> 23:18.106
He won't be a problem anymore.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.827
-SATO: What do you think?
-ADAMU: Could be worse.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.829
CCTV all through the square.

23:32.871 --> 23:35.623
If we can tap those cameras,

23:35.665 --> 23:37.167
-we'll have angles.
-Maybe.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.461
This guy doesn't do anything
without a reason,

23:39.502 --> 23:41.212
so why'd he choose this site?

23:41.254 --> 23:43.673
Who's Blake sending?

23:43.715 --> 23:45.258
I want to keep this small.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.677
Blake would never back this.

23:47.719 --> 23:48.845
He doesn't care
about Peter Solomon.

23:48.887 --> 23:50.013
So he doesn't know?

23:50.055 --> 23:52.307
-Not about this.
-We need backup.

23:52.349 --> 23:54.476
This guy's got people,
we don't know how many.

23:54.517 --> 23:56.853
Remember the M23 rebellion?

23:56.895 --> 23:59.272
UN commander snatched back
from his captors

23:59.314 --> 24:02.108
-by just two operatives.
-In a rented minivan.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.110
We were good.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.904
(chuckles)

24:07.197 --> 24:08.865
This isn't Kinshasa.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.825
This is American soil.

24:10.867 --> 24:13.161
Doing this without a permit
could blow back.

24:13.203 --> 24:15.914
Only if we don't execute.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.625
(indistinct conversation)

24:18.667 --> 24:20.960
You haven't told her?

24:22.587 --> 24:24.673
Good.

24:24.714 --> 24:26.966
It's not going to help anything.

24:27.801 --> 24:30.345
I'm gonna ask you once more:

24:30.387 --> 24:32.806
take this up the chain.

24:33.932 --> 24:37.435
We have less than two hours
to save a man's life,

24:37.477 --> 24:39.604
so I'm gonna ask you:

24:39.646 --> 24:42.691
go with me on this.

24:42.732 --> 24:44.150
Please.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.744
LANGDON:
There's a cross grain

24:54.786 --> 24:57.038
on Dürer's engraving

24:57.080 --> 25:00.041
that only appears when lit
from underneath.

25:00.083 --> 25:04.254
So when we got to the museum,
I saw it: a symbol.

25:04.295 --> 25:05.547
Which was?

25:05.588 --> 25:09.009
A Maltese cross.
An eight-pointed cross

25:09.050 --> 25:11.928
adopted by a subset
of the Knights Templar.

25:11.970 --> 25:14.264
-Suddenly it made sense to me.
-Stop.

25:14.305 --> 25:17.058
-What?
-Who was with you at the museum?

25:17.100 --> 25:18.268
No one.

25:18.309 --> 25:19.769
You said "we."

25:23.606 --> 25:25.442
Could you tell the story
backwards?

25:25.483 --> 25:27.444
-Why would I do that?
-Because the most reliable way

25:27.485 --> 25:30.947
to detect a liar is to ask them
to tell their story in reverse.

25:30.989 --> 25:33.116
-He's not gonna ask me that.
-And you need to relax.

25:33.158 --> 25:35.410
-I need to relax?
-If you don't,

25:35.452 --> 25:36.661
he'll see right through you.

25:36.703 --> 25:40.165
Let me guess,
you want me to meditate?

25:40.957 --> 25:42.959
I remember this argument.

25:43.001 --> 25:44.836
What argument?
There was no argument.

25:44.878 --> 25:46.254
Meditation was pretty much

25:46.296 --> 25:48.423
the only thing that got
me through Zach's death,

25:48.465 --> 25:51.051
and you called it "flimsy."

25:53.386 --> 25:56.306
The only thing
that got you through.

25:57.766 --> 26:02.729
You say that like
my support meant nothing.

26:03.521 --> 26:05.357
You left.

26:05.398 --> 26:07.817
You pushed me away.

26:09.652 --> 26:12.238
Okay, can we just...

26:12.280 --> 26:14.699
(scoffs)

26:14.741 --> 26:16.701
This is a perfect example.

26:16.743 --> 26:19.287
Um, I let you derail me
just then.

26:19.329 --> 26:22.165
(breath trembling):
When we're
in stressful situations,

26:22.207 --> 26:24.542
our anxiety runs wild, and...

26:24.584 --> 26:26.294
mistakes from the past,

26:26.336 --> 26:29.673
fear of what could go wrong
in the future takes over.

26:31.466 --> 26:32.842
I hear you.

26:32.884 --> 26:35.470
I-I just think
I need to simplify...

26:35.512 --> 26:37.055
all this.

26:37.097 --> 26:38.765
Yeah.

26:40.350 --> 26:43.186
You really feel like
I wasn't there for you?

26:48.400 --> 26:50.443
You're here for me now.

26:53.697 --> 26:55.990
(groans softly)

26:58.410 --> 27:00.745
-I wish you could meet him.
-(low, muffled groan)

27:00.787 --> 27:03.248
Then maybe you'd understand.

27:04.624 --> 27:07.544
Maybe you haven't
suffered enough.

27:07.585 --> 27:10.046
When you suffer like we did,

27:10.088 --> 27:13.258
when there is nothing left
to believe in,

27:13.299 --> 27:16.011
and then someone comes
into your life

27:16.052 --> 27:19.264
and shows you how it was all

27:19.305 --> 27:24.102
a necessary stage in the process
of being reborn...

27:24.144 --> 27:27.772
(takes deep breath):
well...

27:27.814 --> 27:31.985
that brings a great clarity.

27:32.777 --> 27:35.030
It allows you to believe
with a fortitude

27:35.071 --> 27:38.199
you would have never had before.

27:38.241 --> 27:42.787
And you would die
for that kind of belief.

27:43.580 --> 27:44.956
(voice-over):
You've reached Alfonso Nuñez.

27:44.998 --> 27:46.541
I'm not able to take your call.

27:46.583 --> 27:49.753
Leave a message, I'll get back
to you as soon as I can.

27:49.794 --> 27:52.047
Voice mail again.

27:52.964 --> 27:54.341
What if something happened
to him?

27:54.382 --> 27:55.675
Well, we can't worry
about that right now.

27:55.717 --> 27:56.885
Okay, Langdon.

27:56.926 --> 27:59.346
We're all in place.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.057
Can you hear me okay?

28:02.098 --> 28:04.392
SATO:
Crystal clear.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.061
Whenever you're ready.

28:07.604 --> 28:09.272
Just a walk in the park.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.734
LANGDON:
What about Nuñez?

28:12.776 --> 28:14.235
Stay focused.

28:14.277 --> 28:15.945
Don't talk.

28:19.449 --> 28:21.451
Scratch your nose
if you hear me.

28:29.959 --> 28:33.296
Langdon,
could be him at six o'clock.

28:34.923 --> 28:37.092
Sorry, false alarm.

28:45.684 --> 28:48.061
(coughs)

28:48.103 --> 28:50.271
I don't see him.
Do you see anything?

28:50.313 --> 28:51.648
Stay put.

28:51.690 --> 28:53.441
We're here on his terms.

28:56.861 --> 28:59.114
(phone vibrating)

29:01.324 --> 29:03.326
SATO:
Answer it.
Put the phone on your left ear,

29:03.368 --> 29:05.245
so there's no feedback
from the earwig.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.081
I'm in the square.
Where are you?

29:08.123 --> 29:09.874
MAL'AKH:
Closer than you think.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.626
But I'm not coming to you.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.169
You're coming to me.

29:13.211 --> 29:14.379
Now follow my directions.

29:14.421 --> 29:17.173
Do not deviate,
or I will hang up

29:17.215 --> 29:19.968
and you
will never see Peter again.

29:20.010 --> 29:21.761
Okay, I understand.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.513
Over your left shoulder,

29:23.555 --> 29:25.807
there's a trash can
on the southwest corner.

29:25.849 --> 29:28.184
Go to it. Now.

29:40.363 --> 29:41.823
I'm here.

29:41.865 --> 29:44.743
Good.
Now say goodbye to the CIA.

29:45.702 --> 29:48.663
-What?
-Toss your earpiece
in the trash

29:48.705 --> 29:50.749
and head directly north.

29:50.790 --> 29:53.668
Langdon, don't. He's bluffing.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.962
MAL'AKH:
Do it now.

30:08.558 --> 30:09.684
Hold here.

30:09.726 --> 30:13.313
You're going to cross
in ten seconds.

30:13.355 --> 30:14.564
Five.

30:14.606 --> 30:15.982
Four.

30:16.024 --> 30:18.026
-Three. Two.
-Whoa, hold on, there's a bus.

30:18.068 --> 30:20.028
-One. Go.
-Oh, shit.

30:20.070 --> 30:22.322
(horn blows)

30:24.991 --> 30:26.493
We lost him. He's alone.

30:26.534 --> 30:28.661
No, he's not.
Adamu, we lost contact.

30:28.703 --> 30:29.954
Don't let him out of your sight.

30:29.996 --> 30:32.248
ADAMU:
You got it.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.544
-(tires screeching,
horns honking)
-Hey!

30:39.422 --> 30:41.549
Adamu, do you have a visual?

30:41.591 --> 30:43.635
Stand by.

30:43.677 --> 30:44.636
He's moving north now.

30:44.678 --> 30:46.554
(audio breaking up)

30:46.596 --> 30:49.057
SATO:
Say again? You're breaking up.

30:49.099 --> 30:51.184
-He's planned all this.
-(audio breaking up)

30:51.226 --> 30:53.103
He's two steps ahead.

30:54.187 --> 30:56.064
-Adamu.
-(audio breaking up)

30:56.106 --> 30:57.440
ADAMU:
Wait.

30:57.482 --> 30:59.401
I see him.

30:59.442 --> 31:02.112
He's going into
the Caelian parking structure,

31:02.153 --> 31:04.614
-corner of H and 23rd.
-I'm coming.

31:04.656 --> 31:06.282
Listen in.

31:06.324 --> 31:10.578
If things go bad, call 911,
say there's a bomb. Got that?

31:10.620 --> 31:12.080
Yeah.

31:21.131 --> 31:23.299
MAL'AKH:
Take the stairs.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.553
Go to level 1.

31:26.594 --> 31:29.014
Section C.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.400
(low groaning)

31:42.235 --> 31:45.655
I could see your pain
when we met yesterday.

31:46.489 --> 31:49.909
You looked like Nick
before he found peace.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.286
(Nuñez grunts)

31:51.327 --> 31:55.081
-Now you'll have no more pain.
-(exhales)

32:11.181 --> 32:12.557
(grunting)

32:23.735 --> 32:25.111
Put it down.

32:25.153 --> 32:27.489
We don't have to do this.

32:27.530 --> 32:31.659
Okay? My friends are gonna give
your boss everything he wants.

32:31.701 --> 32:34.871
Okay? They get Peter Solomon
back, and everybody wins.

32:34.913 --> 32:37.165
He can't go back.

32:38.166 --> 32:40.502
He's the instrument.

32:40.543 --> 32:41.961
(pants)

32:42.003 --> 32:43.546
Instrument?

32:44.714 --> 32:46.883
What the hell
are you talking about?

32:46.925 --> 32:48.760
For the final stage.

32:48.802 --> 32:50.136
Okay, look.

32:50.178 --> 32:54.182
We can do this here or downtown,

32:54.224 --> 32:55.725
but either way
I got the gun, so...

32:55.767 --> 33:00.021
I'm taking you in, and
you're gonna tell us everything.

33:00.063 --> 33:03.191
-No!
-(grunting)

33:27.590 --> 33:29.217
I'm here.

33:29.259 --> 33:32.345
Level 1, section C.

33:32.387 --> 33:35.432
MAL'AKH:
We meet upon the level.

33:43.690 --> 33:46.359
And what have you brought
for me?

33:57.078 --> 33:58.872
Put it on the ground.

34:21.102 --> 34:23.772
And what does it say?

34:24.564 --> 34:27.609
"Jeova Sanctus Unus."

34:27.650 --> 34:29.861
It's Latin for...

34:29.903 --> 34:32.155
One true God.

34:37.827 --> 34:41.831
The pyramid and capstone
come together to form a map.

34:43.833 --> 34:46.461
I'm not saying anything else
until I see Peter.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.221
Peter!

34:56.262 --> 34:58.223
Are you okay?

35:00.934 --> 35:03.478
Now tell me...

35:03.520 --> 35:05.522
where has the map pointed you?

35:05.563 --> 35:07.190
It's not that simple.

35:07.232 --> 35:12.028
There are parts of this myth
that require greater context.

35:12.070 --> 35:13.822
Oh.

35:13.863 --> 35:15.990
Well, please...

35:16.032 --> 35:19.536
enlighten me, Professor.

35:21.371 --> 35:23.581
(panting):
As you know...

35:24.874 --> 35:28.169
...the legend says
that the Freemasons

35:28.211 --> 35:32.173
brought the ancient wisdom
from the Old World to the New.

35:32.215 --> 35:36.302
But if one goes back further,
then it was the Knights Templar

35:36.344 --> 35:39.014
who originally discovered it.

35:39.055 --> 35:40.557
And it is from them

35:40.598 --> 35:44.352
that we get this very specific

35:44.394 --> 35:47.147
protective mechanism,
this portal...

35:47.188 --> 35:48.732
I got eyes on Peter.

35:48.773 --> 35:50.775
-So, keeping all that in mind...
-There's one man with him.

35:50.817 --> 35:52.527
LANGDON:
...according to the myth,

35:52.569 --> 35:56.031
the pyramid will lead us
to a large stone

35:56.072 --> 35:58.033
covering the entrance
to a spiral staircase

35:58.074 --> 36:02.203
that descends several
hundred feet into the ground.

36:02.245 --> 36:04.539
MAL'AKH:
I know the myth.

36:05.415 --> 36:06.916
What else?

36:06.958 --> 36:09.169
You have to understand,

36:09.210 --> 36:10.920
this staircase...

36:10.962 --> 36:12.255
doesn't exist.

36:12.297 --> 36:14.716
Perhaps, not surprisingly,
it's a metaphor.

36:14.758 --> 36:17.719
A-a spiral
symbolically represents a unity

36:17.761 --> 36:20.221
of the mental,
physical and spiritual self

36:20.263 --> 36:22.932
in an expansion
of consciousness.

36:24.601 --> 36:28.605
MAL'AKH:
I'm losing my patience,
Professor.

36:39.783 --> 36:41.117
It wasn't until I saw
the, the capstone

36:41.159 --> 36:42.577
and I read the inscription

36:42.619 --> 36:45.622
that I was able
to narrow down the location.

36:45.663 --> 36:48.583
"The secret hides
within the Order."

36:50.377 --> 36:52.796
Not the Masonic Order, per se...

36:52.837 --> 36:54.506
We go now.

36:54.547 --> 36:57.634
You take Bastin.
I'll cover Mal'akh.

36:57.676 --> 37:00.595
...but the Order
of the Eastern Star.

37:00.637 --> 37:02.555
(sighs)

37:02.597 --> 37:07.977
And the Order
of the Eastern Star

37:08.019 --> 37:09.479
is headquartered here in D.C.,

37:09.521 --> 37:11.690
the Perry Belmont House on...

37:11.731 --> 37:13.191
on C Street.

37:13.233 --> 37:16.111
The Belmont House.

37:16.152 --> 37:19.406
It was finished in 1906,
but the plot of land

37:19.447 --> 37:22.158
over which the house was built
had remained undeveloped

37:22.200 --> 37:24.452
for decades
because of a very large,

37:24.494 --> 37:28.581
very problematic stone right
in the center of the property.

37:33.712 --> 37:35.213
Mal'akh!

37:35.255 --> 37:36.881
This is over.

37:37.340 --> 37:38.675
Drop your weapon.

37:39.217 --> 37:41.219
Give the bag to Langdon.

37:43.972 --> 37:45.098
Come with me, sir.

37:45.890 --> 37:48.351
What's the final stage?

37:50.353 --> 37:52.313
"Peter Solomon is the instrument
of the final stage."

37:52.355 --> 37:53.690
What does it mean?

37:54.482 --> 37:56.651
MAN:
Freeze! Right now!

37:56.693 --> 37:58.486
-Hands on your head!
-Hands on your head!

37:58.528 --> 38:00.572
-(grunts)
-(gunshot)

38:03.408 --> 38:04.909
-MAN: Left, go left.
-(engine starts)

38:04.951 --> 38:06.119
Don't shoot!

38:06.161 --> 38:07.370
-(tires squealing)
-Go, go, go, go.

38:07.412 --> 38:09.497
-Let him go. Let him go!
-Stop!

38:12.751 --> 38:14.252
(tires screech)

38:16.588 --> 38:17.589
(grunts)

38:18.381 --> 38:19.674
(tires squealing)

38:19.716 --> 38:21.801
Hold your fire!

38:37.776 --> 38:39.611
What happened?

38:39.652 --> 38:40.904
Where's my dad?

38:40.945 --> 38:43.281
Katherine...

38:46.785 --> 38:48.578
(Katherine crying)

38:48.620 --> 38:50.872
What happened?

38:50.914 --> 38:52.624
They're gone.

38:52.665 --> 38:54.292
Gone?

38:55.669 --> 38:57.962
Wait, wait.

38:58.004 --> 38:59.881
Robert? Robert?

38:59.923 --> 39:01.424
Robert!

39:05.762 --> 39:07.806
What happened?

39:14.813 --> 39:16.272
No.

39:18.483 --> 39:21.236
How did this happen?

39:21.277 --> 39:23.571
Who are all these people?

39:23.613 --> 39:27.033
There wasn't supposed to be
anyone else.

39:27.075 --> 39:28.576
They're ours. And, no,

39:28.618 --> 39:31.788
they weren't supposed
to be here.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.832
But somehow they knew.

39:44.843 --> 39:47.470
You think this was me?

39:47.512 --> 39:50.265
You seemed real eager
to tell Blake.

39:50.306 --> 39:51.891
Then his guys show up.

39:51.933 --> 39:53.852
What am I supposed to think?

40:09.743 --> 40:10.577
(gasps)

40:10.618 --> 40:12.829
MAL'AKH:
No more lies.

40:12.871 --> 40:15.081
This is your last chance.

40:15.123 --> 40:17.792
You are now free of distraction.

40:19.002 --> 40:23.840
In isolation
we find things in ourselves.

40:23.882 --> 40:26.343
Buried things.

40:26.384 --> 40:29.346
Here you will solve
the great mystery.

40:30.180 --> 40:32.349
If you don't,

40:32.390 --> 40:34.976
you will watch Peter die.

40:36.102 --> 40:38.605
And then you will die.

40:48.114 --> 40:51.785
Publish or perish, Professor.

41:13.556 --> 41:13.682
(breathing heavily)
