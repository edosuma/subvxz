00:24.199 --> 00:26.536
I'm gonna be
the greatest bowler one day,

00:26.569 --> 00:30.072
knocking pin by pin,
one by one, and we're gonna win

00:30.105 --> 00:31.674
the Astro SuperBowl
Tournament this year.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.175
Yeah we are.

00:34.176 --> 00:37.246
Look at that technique,
slow and smooth

00:37.279 --> 00:38.548
as they roll the ball
down the aisle.

00:38.715 --> 00:41.116
Strike by strike,
the balls roll.

00:41.150 --> 00:43.218
Hey, Chase,
you dreaming about joining

00:43.386 --> 00:44.353
the Guinness Book
of World Record

00:45.388 --> 00:46.288
for girl that loses
the most games in bowling?

00:46.955 --> 00:48.558
- Yeah.
- Get lost, punk.

00:49.191 --> 00:50.894
Chase, don't listen to them.

00:51.093 --> 00:52.529
This is the last day of summer,

00:52.562 --> 00:54.930
and we are finally gonna
win one of these days.

00:55.297 --> 00:56.533
You really think so?

00:57.065 --> 00:58.401
Yeah, sure we will.

00:58.668 --> 01:00.102
Our teammates are intimidating,

01:00.269 --> 01:01.170
but we round off the team,

01:01.203 --> 01:02.705
and they wouldn't have
a team without us.

01:02.739 --> 01:04.306
Now, let's just get to our lane,

01:04.339 --> 01:06.275
and let's ignore these losers.

01:06.476 --> 01:08.177
Yeah, you heard me.

01:21.223 --> 01:23.292
Hey, Chase and Pam!

01:23.460 --> 01:24.427
Hi, Mrs. Thompson.

01:24.461 --> 01:26.729
It's Roberta,
none of this formal stuff.

01:26.763 --> 01:29.064
Right, sorry,
I'm just used to being polite.

01:29.331 --> 01:31.401
We're like family here,
so don't you worry.

01:31.568 --> 01:34.303
Hey, I'm glad you're here,
you're up next.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.476
Roberta, I'm not good.

01:39.509 --> 01:41.377
In fact, I'm the worst bowler
on the team.

01:42.044 --> 01:45.113
You can't be afraid
to take risks in life.

01:45.615 --> 01:49.752
You have to take the risk
without losing who you are.

01:51.754 --> 01:55.224
Go ahead, use the Holy Roller
for this one.

01:55.658 --> 01:57.393
Slayers never die.

01:58.093 --> 02:01.631
We bowl like thunder,
we strike like lightning!

02:14.276 --> 02:15.277
Told you I'm not good.

02:16.479 --> 02:17.680
You're getting better.

02:19.382 --> 02:21.216
You girls
did a great job.

02:21.250 --> 02:22.519
I brought gifts.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.492
- What do you think?
- I love it.

02:29.526 --> 02:30.793
Oh my gosh.

02:30.827 --> 02:32.327
- You like it?
- It's so cute.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.362
Good!

02:33.863 --> 02:36.098
Yes, I'm so proud of you girls.

04:32.749 --> 04:34.751
Chase, dear, are you excited

04:34.784 --> 04:37.920
for your first day of
senior year in high school?

04:37.954 --> 04:39.321
You bet I am.

04:39.789 --> 04:41.256
Are you gonna
be needing a ride,

04:41.289 --> 04:42.825
or are you going with
your best friend, Pam?

04:42.959 --> 04:44.894
Pam's picking me up
in a couple of minutes.

04:44.927 --> 04:46.529
I appreciate you guys
letting me go to school

04:46.562 --> 04:48.196
with her, so I don't
look like a dork,

04:48.230 --> 04:49.832
bring dropped off by my mother.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.435
Can I go with you guys?

04:52.702 --> 04:55.270
No, heck no,
I don't wanna look

04:55.303 --> 04:57.707
like a little loser with
my little tag-along brother.

04:58.675 --> 05:01.276
Don't worry, Dean,
I'm taking you to school.

05:01.544 --> 05:03.780
Some of us aren't as
mean as your sister.

05:03.813 --> 05:05.948
Oh, gotta go.

05:06.449 --> 05:07.717
What about your breakfast?

05:08.985 --> 05:10.285
Take a banana.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.888
Well, have a nice day, honey.

05:11.921 --> 05:13.589
- Bye!
- Bye.

05:21.296 --> 05:22.598
Chase, let's get going.

05:22.632 --> 05:23.766
We don't wanna be late.

05:23.800 --> 05:24.801
Okay, okay.

05:36.612 --> 05:39.314
I heard that Coach Becca
went missing

05:39.347 --> 05:41.316
over the summer and
they had to hire a new coach.

05:41.349 --> 05:42.350
Oh, yeah.

05:43.318 --> 05:45.455
I also heard that
the cheerleading squad

05:45.488 --> 05:47.355
flat out did not
return this year

05:47.390 --> 05:48.624
out of grief or something.

05:48.991 --> 05:49.826
That's unfortunate.

05:51.293 --> 05:53.328
What if we join
the cheerleading team,

05:53.361 --> 05:55.431
and then rule the school
in their place.

05:55.832 --> 05:57.800
School would
never let rejects like us

05:57.834 --> 05:59.635
onto the cheerleading squad.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.619
Who are those girls?

06:16.652 --> 06:19.354
They're new and they're already
talking to Sean Patrick?

06:22.324 --> 06:23.926
We're gonna have cool friends
like that one day.

06:24.393 --> 06:26.361
This year, I'm gonna
say yes to anything

06:26.395 --> 06:27.663
that will make us cool.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.065
I've been cautious
my whole life,

06:29.098 --> 06:32.568
and I think it's about time
I start taking some risks.

06:32.835 --> 06:34.771
I love that!

06:34.804 --> 06:36.005
Yeah, yeah, me too.

06:36.405 --> 06:39.274
Finally giving into your
rebellious side, I see.

06:39.809 --> 06:41.978
Okay, so let's make a promise
to each other

06:42.011 --> 06:43.479
to say yes to
anything this year,

06:43.946 --> 06:46.849
and I mean anything,
no matter how crazy.

06:46.883 --> 06:48.050
Yes.

06:50.352 --> 06:52.588
Maybe I'll even ask
Sean Patrick out on a date.

06:54.857 --> 06:56.626
Okay, come on.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.796
Hey, Chase, hi, Pam.

06:59.829 --> 07:01.296
No.

07:02.131 --> 07:03.699
Oh, I'm so sorry!

07:04.400 --> 07:06.969
I don't really have a lot
of tolerance for losers.

07:07.637 --> 07:08.738
Yeah, sure you don't.

07:08.771 --> 07:10.940
Let her go.

07:14.610 --> 07:15.645
Choke her.

07:17.113 --> 07:19.816
You will never
ask the hottest guy

07:19.849 --> 07:21.717
in school out on a date.

07:22.518 --> 07:24.420
All right, all right,
all right, ladies.

07:24.453 --> 07:25.755
All right, what are your names?

07:26.489 --> 07:28.491
And do you even
go to school here?

07:29.859 --> 07:34.897
Maybe we do,
or maybe we don't.

07:34.931 --> 07:36.699
Don't get smart
with me, young lady.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.769
I'm sure you have
some place to be,

07:39.802 --> 07:43.005
so go get your
butts to class now.

07:43.639 --> 07:45.441
Your wish is my command.

07:48.711 --> 07:49.879
Losers.

07:49.912 --> 07:52.582
Well, can you two ladies
tell me what's going on here?

07:53.683 --> 07:55.585
No worries, it's just
a misunderstanding.

07:55.618 --> 07:56.619
We're okay.

07:57.854 --> 08:00.590
Well, I may be new here,
but I can spot

08:00.623 --> 08:02.124
a troublemaker from a mile away,

08:02.158 --> 08:04.427
and those girls
look like bad news.

08:04.994 --> 08:06.095
Yeah, we know.

08:07.897 --> 08:10.032
Well, I'm Mrs. Rooney,
I'm the new cheerleading coach.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.468
It's nice to meet you,
I'm Chase, and this is Pam.

08:12.969 --> 08:15.771
I'm holding auditions tonight
in the school gymnasium.

08:16.439 --> 08:17.974
How do you girls
feel about trying out

08:18.007 --> 08:19.041
for cheerleading squad?

08:19.542 --> 08:20.977
All the slots are up for grabs.

08:21.010 --> 08:24.380
No, couldn't be us, no way.

08:25.848 --> 08:28.451
Actually, she means yes.

08:29.018 --> 08:30.987
We'll be there,
nice to meet you, Miss Rooney.

08:31.020 --> 08:32.922
- Nice to meet you.
- Let's go.

08:35.457 --> 08:37.193
No risk, no reward, ladies.

08:51.807 --> 08:56.412
Good afternoon,
welcome to AP English.

08:57.179 --> 08:59.815
Today, we'll be working on
your summer reading.

09:00.082 --> 09:03.052
You new students who were
not with us last year,

09:03.619 --> 09:05.488
the reading assignment for them

09:05.521 --> 09:10.559
was to read the poem titled
"Rime of the Ancient Mariner."

09:10.960 --> 09:14.096
If you read it,
you already know the answer,

09:14.830 --> 09:18.701
but, before we begin,
we need to have a discussion

09:19.101 --> 09:21.938
about the main theme behind

09:21.971 --> 09:24.440
"The Rime of
the Ancient Mariner."

09:25.808 --> 09:30.479
Can anyone tell me
the main theme of this story?

09:32.581 --> 09:33.582
Anyone?

09:34.650 --> 09:36.585
Anyone? No one?

09:37.553 --> 09:38.554
Yes, please.

09:39.522 --> 09:42.558
It's a long poem about
supernatural powers,

09:42.591 --> 09:45.695
written in 1793 by
Samuel Taylor Coleridge,

09:45.728 --> 09:48.898
where a sailor is
fighting a curse

09:48.931 --> 09:50.866
put on him and his shipmates.

09:50.900 --> 09:53.002
The main theme is
moral repentance.

09:53.703 --> 09:55.171
Very well, thank you.

09:55.738 --> 09:58.007
You may continue with
your assignments.

10:03.679 --> 10:04.613
Hey.

10:06.615 --> 10:07.516
What?

10:07.550 --> 10:10.820
So, are we gonna
do this tonight or...?

10:11.887 --> 10:13.856
No, it's too scary.

10:14.023 --> 10:15.658
What if we just don't audition?

10:15.691 --> 10:17.093
What happened to saying yes?

10:18.561 --> 10:20.629
If you manage to
overcome your fear,

10:21.163 --> 10:22.965
I'll try out, too, deal?

10:23.632 --> 10:24.633
Fine.

10:25.568 --> 10:27.169
No risk, no reward, right?

10:27.870 --> 10:30.506
Let's make this
the best senior year ever.

10:33.909 --> 10:36.245
Welcome to this year's
cheerleader tryouts.

10:36.278 --> 10:40.116
My name is Mrs. Rooney, and
I'm the new cheerleading coach.

10:40.149 --> 10:42.818
Now I just want to take
a moment to show you something.

10:43.319 --> 10:46.288
This is just one of
the many trophies

10:46.322 --> 10:48.657
I've won over
the course of my career.

10:48.924 --> 10:51.060
It's special because
it was the first,

10:53.029 --> 10:55.031
but definitely not the last.

10:55.064 --> 10:57.633
- Oh, no.
- I like to think cheer is easy,

10:58.067 --> 11:00.669
and, if it was any easier,
it would be called football.

11:01.037 --> 11:02.171
Losers.

11:02.204 --> 11:04.573
So show me your best,

11:04.607 --> 11:07.076
and I promise to show
you your true best.

11:07.910 --> 11:11.147
Chase, don't worry about it.
Just focus on cheerleading.

11:12.314 --> 11:13.315
Okay.

11:13.682 --> 11:17.887
Okay, ladies,
all spots are open.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.688
Let the auditions begin.

11:19.955 --> 11:20.956
Good luck.

11:21.690 --> 11:23.292
May the best woman win.

11:50.719 --> 11:51.754
Woo!

11:56.859 --> 11:57.860
You first.

11:59.962 --> 12:01.864
You got this, okay?

13:05.861 --> 13:08.230
Wow, that was so good.

14:17.132 --> 14:19.502
- How do you think I did?
- You did really good.

14:19.536 --> 14:21.904
Not sure how I did,
but at least I tried.

14:22.938 --> 14:26.409
All right, ladies,
thank you so much for being here tonight.

14:26.443 --> 14:28.077
Y'all did a wonderful job.

14:28.411 --> 14:31.247
I will be posting
the results of this audition

14:31.280 --> 14:32.982
outside my office.

14:59.409 --> 15:00.809
I made it!

15:06.549 --> 15:08.284
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, no.

15:08.317 --> 15:09.985
That works out, actually.

15:10.019 --> 15:12.021
I don't wanna be on
the cheerleading squad, anyway.

15:12.921 --> 15:15.224
Besides, I can
still go to games.

15:16.025 --> 15:17.326
And that'll still be fun.

15:18.894 --> 15:20.362
It's funny that you
mention that, Pam.

15:21.398 --> 15:24.099
I need an assistant to
help me manage the girls,

15:24.366 --> 15:27.303
someone who can be at practice
everyday and help me out.

15:28.337 --> 15:30.172
Are you serious,
do I look like...

15:30.205 --> 15:31.206
Yes!

15:33.208 --> 15:35.010
She would love to
say yes to this.

15:35.044 --> 15:40.550
Actually, fun fact, Pam here
is the epitome of school spirit.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.084
Really?

15:49.958 --> 15:52.161
Does your brother
just read comic books all day?

15:52.194 --> 15:54.029
Something like that.

15:54.063 --> 15:55.831
It's always that nerdy stuff.

15:56.633 --> 15:58.067
Puberty sure hit him hard.

15:58.267 --> 15:59.268
He's super tall now.

16:01.236 --> 16:03.238
Oh, great, what do you want?

16:04.340 --> 16:07.510
I just wanted to apologize
for my behavior the other day.

16:08.110 --> 16:11.080
I think that you both did
a great job at the tryouts,

16:11.113 --> 16:14.116
and, Pam, I'm sorry you
didn't make it on the team.

16:14.584 --> 16:17.520
But at least you'll still be with us
at practices and at the games, right?

16:18.521 --> 16:19.622
Thanks.

16:20.390 --> 16:21.323
Let me introduce myself.

16:22.157 --> 16:24.993
I'm Cynthia, but they
call me Sin for short.

16:25.395 --> 16:27.363
This is Violet and Lucy.

16:28.130 --> 16:29.466
Well, it's nice to meet you.

16:30.966 --> 16:32.868
I'm throwing a house party,
and I would love if you guys could come.

16:34.002 --> 16:37.373
Come on, Pam, Chase,

16:37.540 --> 16:40.209
there will be plenty of alcohol
and boys there!

16:41.578 --> 16:43.979
This is a big deal.

16:44.012 --> 16:46.248
We get to go to
a cool party with boys.

16:46.281 --> 16:47.883
I know, tell me about it.

16:48.951 --> 16:54.391
Also, I'm not upset about
the whole cheerleading thing.

16:54.691 --> 16:56.258
It's all a good time.

16:56.291 --> 16:57.960
Anyway, this is much bigger.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.530
The cheerleading
parties are top notch.

17:00.563 --> 17:03.899
We get to party
and meet cool boys.

17:04.567 --> 17:06.167
It's happening, Chase.

17:06.201 --> 17:07.637
Yes, it is.

17:10.038 --> 17:11.272
Let's get out of here.

17:29.158 --> 17:31.293
You made it.

17:31.326 --> 17:33.496
Sin was just talking
about you, Chase.

17:34.329 --> 17:37.467
Sin said you would come,
but I didn't think you would.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.301
Come on in.

17:56.519 --> 17:59.087
Chase, you made it!

17:59.121 --> 18:00.457
Thank you for coming.

18:01.624 --> 18:08.363
Pam, I got you
some tequila shots.

18:11.468 --> 18:13.068
- Take it.
- I don't drink.

18:16.238 --> 18:19.041
Come on, remember?
Our promise?

18:20.610 --> 18:24.179
Just tonight.
Gotta take risks.

18:24.213 --> 18:26.114
Drink. Drink.

18:26.649 --> 18:27.450
Yay.

18:28.518 --> 18:30.185
My parents are in Europe
for the fall,

18:30.219 --> 18:32.254
so I decided to
have everyone over.

18:33.222 --> 18:34.223
Follow me, ladies.

18:35.224 --> 18:38.126
This is the first,
but it won't be the last.

18:41.397 --> 18:43.165
Oh, hey, I see
someone from chem,

18:43.198 --> 18:45.033
so I'm gonna go mingle.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.369
Remember, if anyone asks,
what's our answer?

18:47.770 --> 18:49.405
- Yes.
- All righty.

19:03.553 --> 19:05.421
Welcome to the team, Chase.

19:06.288 --> 19:08.658
Consider yourself
my new project.

19:09.358 --> 19:12.361
When I'm done with you, you
can have whatever guy you want.

19:15.498 --> 19:18.033
But, first, I wanted to
do something special.

19:19.167 --> 19:21.236
Aren't you wondering why
everyone's in a mask?

19:22.672 --> 19:26.676
Tonight is initiation night.

19:26.709 --> 19:28.711
What about Pam?

19:29.479 --> 19:32.047
Pam isn't ready yet,
but don't worry,

19:32.549 --> 19:34.316
she'll get initiated
soon enough.

19:35.652 --> 19:36.753
Hey.

19:36.786 --> 19:38.287
- Pam!
- Hey.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.823
What are you doing here, dude?
I never see you at parties.

19:40.857 --> 19:43.158
- I'm here for this guy.
- What?

19:43.191 --> 19:44.594
- A keg stand?
- Yeah.

19:45.528 --> 19:49.566
I have to tell you something,
and it's very important.

19:51.568 --> 19:54.202
You do know that we're
really vampires, right?

19:56.138 --> 19:58.508
Okay, yeah, right.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.342
And we're here to
take over the school.

20:01.477 --> 20:04.581
We want you to be a part of us.

20:05.347 --> 20:06.783
But, in order to be
a true team member,

20:07.349 --> 20:09.151
you have to drink
from this chalice.

20:09.619 --> 20:10.620
What's in it?

20:11.554 --> 20:12.555
Blood.

20:13.623 --> 20:14.624
Come on.

20:16.626 --> 20:17.794
Come on.

20:19.062 --> 20:22.130
Just act like it's one of our
special mixes of Pongo juice.

20:38.246 --> 20:44.487
Chase, Chase,
Chase, Chase, Chase,

20:44.520 --> 20:51.527
Chase, Chase, Chase, Chase,
Chase, Chase, Chase, Chase!

20:52.428 --> 20:54.162
Woo, yay!

20:54.196 --> 20:55.798
Step one, and done.

20:55.832 --> 20:57.700
The second step is for you
to make your first kill,

20:57.734 --> 20:58.835
but that will come in time.

20:58.868 --> 21:01.236
Let's celebrate, woo!

21:52.320 --> 21:53.589
It's so bright.

22:01.998 --> 22:03.331
What's going on?

22:05.333 --> 22:06.469
Not a big fan.

22:07.970 --> 22:09.572
Is everything
all right, honey?

22:10.473 --> 22:11.474
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:12.475 --> 22:14.977
Why are you wearing
sunglasses in the house?

22:24.854 --> 22:28.991
Because it's bright outside

22:29.025 --> 22:32.327
and all the cool kids
are doing it.

22:55.985 --> 22:57.887
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.655
Just had a headache,
and I don't know why.

23:00.389 --> 23:04.393
Mm. It's called a hangover,
when people drink too much.

23:04.827 --> 23:06.529
Here, take this.

23:06.562 --> 23:08.363
It'll help with the pain.

23:10.066 --> 23:13.035
Here are your term papers,
nicely done.

23:14.070 --> 23:16.005
An A-plus for you.

23:16.038 --> 23:19.374
I can see a lot of hard work
went into these.

23:19.942 --> 23:23.813
A-plus, and another A-plus.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.415
And for you, A... ow.

23:28.484 --> 23:30.386
Oh, gave myself a paper cut.

23:40.096 --> 23:43.432
Oh, I'm sorry,
she has an overactive bladder.

23:45.501 --> 23:47.302
Very well,
I'll be right back.

23:58.581 --> 24:00.516
Can I ask you a question,
Miss Rooney?

24:00.550 --> 24:01.751
What's on your mind?

24:01.784 --> 24:03.419
Why do we have
practices at night

24:03.452 --> 24:05.421
instead of after school
like other schools?

24:05.988 --> 24:07.857
Let me explain
something to you, Pam.

24:08.858 --> 24:11.661
Cheerleading requires
a lot of physical work

24:11.694 --> 24:14.897
and mental wellbeing,
and this is the best time

24:15.064 --> 24:17.099
for that physical
and mental growth.

24:17.133 --> 24:18.333
That makes sense.

24:19.669 --> 24:21.037
- Hi, Mrs. Rooney.
- Hello.

24:21.070 --> 24:22.071
Pam, ready to go?

24:23.973 --> 24:25.074
- Goodnight, ladies.
- Goodnight.

24:25.107 --> 24:26.108
Bye.

24:29.779 --> 24:31.247
Did your
migraine go away?

24:31.280 --> 24:34.083
Oh, yeah, I think whatever
you gave me this morning helped it.

24:34.116 --> 24:35.718
- That's good.
- Yeah.

24:35.751 --> 24:37.954
Oh, I forgot to grab my
pom-poms, they're in my locker.

24:37.987 --> 24:39.188
No, I just wanna go home.

24:39.222 --> 24:41.390
- Can we get it tomorrow?
- Dude, they're just right inside...

24:41.424 --> 24:42.391
Hey, Chase.

24:42.925 --> 24:44.460
Hey.

24:44.493 --> 24:46.562
I just wanted to
say that it's awesome

24:46.596 --> 24:48.030
working with you on the cheers.

24:48.531 --> 24:50.132
It's great because
you're becoming

24:50.166 --> 24:51.701
one of the cool girls now,

24:51.734 --> 24:52.969
and I can't wait
to introduce you

24:53.002 --> 24:54.737
to some of my guy friends.

24:54.770 --> 24:56.505
Thanks, Sin,
I look forward to it.

24:56.539 --> 24:57.640
See you tomorrow.

24:59.508 --> 25:01.744
You're becoming one
of the cool girls now.

25:02.845 --> 25:05.514
What? I was just joking!

25:24.166 --> 25:25.534
Your turn to bowl.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.503
Okay.

25:42.818 --> 25:44.921
- Bro, that was good.
- Did you see that?

25:47.957 --> 25:49.926
- Oh, no.
- What?

25:49.959 --> 25:54.597
Um, Sin, Sean Patrick, and the
other cheerleaders are coming.

25:56.098 --> 25:57.800
So, this is where you hide out

25:57.833 --> 26:00.703
when you're not with us
being a popular cheerleader.

26:01.837 --> 26:03.039
Sometimes.

26:03.706 --> 26:04.840
We come here twice a week.

26:04.874 --> 26:08.978
Except for now, she's
beginning to beat the old gals.

26:09.011 --> 26:10.980
Mm, wow.

26:12.081 --> 26:15.117
I just wanted to
introduce you to Sean.

26:15.952 --> 26:18.721
Sean, this is Chase and Pam.

26:19.221 --> 26:21.724
So you're the new cheerleader
everyone's been talking about.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.727
Do you think you can
teach me how to bowl?

26:27.530 --> 26:29.198
Um, sure.

26:33.235 --> 26:35.972
Hey, girls, how is
cheerleading practice going?

26:36.005 --> 26:38.774
It's going pretty well. We're learning
a lot from our new cheerleading coach.

26:38.975 --> 26:41.477
And why are you having
all the practices at night?

26:41.711 --> 26:46.682
Well, we're getting ready
for our night games, so.

26:47.283 --> 26:49.285
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.

26:49.318 --> 26:50.853
We're gonna go
upstairs to get ready.

26:51.287 --> 26:52.555
Okay.

26:59.061 --> 27:00.696
Hurry up and get
ready so we're not

27:00.730 --> 27:02.164
the last people showing
up at Sin's house.

27:02.198 --> 27:06.135
All right, just, did I tell you I'm
having trouble sleeping at night?

27:06.168 --> 27:08.704
Maybe it's because
of the new schedule.

27:08.738 --> 27:10.740
I mean, we have been
staying out a lot later.

27:10.773 --> 27:12.675
But for some reason, I get
a headache in the daylight,

27:12.842 --> 27:14.877
and I don't even wanna
go to this party tonight.

27:14.910 --> 27:17.013
There's a lot
going on right now,

27:17.046 --> 27:18.881
but you just need
to relax, okay?

27:19.248 --> 27:22.051
You're just going through
a phase, like puberty.

27:22.785 --> 27:24.653
We just gotta grow
through it, all right?

27:24.687 --> 27:27.023
Now, come on, let's go get
some alcohol for the party.

27:31.060 --> 27:32.194
Guess it's just the vodka.

27:33.662 --> 27:35.664
That's 15 dollars, young lady.

27:35.931 --> 27:37.800
Do you have $15?

27:38.667 --> 27:43.806
And, since you look like a
12-year-old, I'd like to see ID.

27:45.674 --> 27:47.076
I didn't bring my ID.

27:48.844 --> 27:52.548
No ID, no alcohol!

27:53.816 --> 27:58.821
Sell me the vodka, now.

28:01.157 --> 28:02.158
Yeah.

28:03.092 --> 28:04.093
Here, here.

28:14.770 --> 28:16.338
Oh, God, no.

28:17.706 --> 28:19.275
I pissed my pants!

28:21.110 --> 28:23.946
You did it?

28:29.386 --> 28:31.353
Now, let's go to this party.

28:52.708 --> 28:53.709
Hey, guys.

28:54.610 --> 28:55.744
Man, it looks like
you scored big time.

28:56.846 --> 28:59.014
Yep. Chase is pretty
funky fresh, if you ask me.

28:59.281 --> 29:01.617
- Really?
- It was nothing.

29:02.017 --> 29:03.018
How'd you do it?

29:04.019 --> 29:05.054
Really, it was nothing.

29:05.087 --> 29:07.089
I told the clerk to sell
me some vodka, and he did.

29:08.023 --> 29:11.127
Well, if that's the case,
who wants shots?

29:12.395 --> 29:17.366
Ooh, Chase, why don't you
and your friends come join us?

29:23.038 --> 29:25.274
Violet, you will go first.

29:40.256 --> 29:42.291
Ah, you bit me!

29:42.958 --> 29:47.363
Oops, I guess I'm just
dangerous like that.

29:48.731 --> 29:50.799
Chase, your turn.

29:56.172 --> 30:00.176
Ooh, look who gets
to kiss the hot guy.

30:01.210 --> 30:02.678
I mean, the rules
are the rules.

30:07.183 --> 30:11.454
Oh, sorry, my bad,
thought it was a snake.

30:13.189 --> 30:14.424
Come on,
let's get out of here.

30:14.457 --> 30:15.858
- It's too embarrassing.
- Bye!

30:20.095 --> 30:22.097
Your cheerleader friends
are pretty crazy, huh?

30:22.998 --> 30:23.999
Yeah, I guess so.

30:24.900 --> 30:25.801
Actually, I don't
know them that well.

30:27.102 --> 30:29.338
One day, I was the worst bowler
on the senior's bowling team,

30:29.371 --> 30:30.973
and, the next,
I am a cheerleader.

30:31.273 --> 30:32.341
It's crazy.

30:32.975 --> 30:34.343
I think it's neat
that you can bowl.

30:35.244 --> 30:37.313
No, it's embarrassing, I know,

30:37.346 --> 30:39.281
but those old ladies
are actually pretty cool

30:39.449 --> 30:40.983
if you listen to their stories.

30:42.419 --> 30:44.987
Pam and I are on the Slayers,
and we sew our names onto our shirts.

30:47.990 --> 30:49.825
I can't believe
I just told you that.

30:49.858 --> 30:51.461
No, I think it's cool.

30:51.494 --> 30:53.195
It makes you unique
and interesting.

30:53.530 --> 30:55.498
You're not just a dumb
cheerleader, after all.

30:56.499 --> 30:58.000
Thanks.

30:58.401 --> 31:00.102
Oh, man, I can't
believe I just said that.

31:00.135 --> 31:02.938
Wh... what I mean is you're
not like a stereotype

31:02.972 --> 31:03.906
like you see on TV.

31:03.939 --> 31:06.443
Oh, so you're not
the stereotypical jock

31:06.809 --> 31:07.910
we see on TV, either.

31:08.277 --> 31:09.278
I like that.

31:09.311 --> 31:12.114
Do you think maybe
we could finish that kiss

31:12.147 --> 31:15.385
or start it or whatever?

31:17.086 --> 31:18.053
Yeah, I think so.

31:42.177 --> 31:45.881
I get it, it's too soon,
I'm sorry that I ruined it.

31:45.914 --> 31:47.349
I'm just so nervous.

31:47.983 --> 31:50.019
No, no, no, no,
no, you are fine.

31:50.052 --> 31:51.320
Ummmm...

31:52.455 --> 31:53.556
I have to go now.

32:00.195 --> 32:01.464
Chase,
are you all right?

32:05.134 --> 32:06.268
Chase, what's wrong?

32:11.240 --> 32:12.241
Oh my God.

32:14.076 --> 32:15.911
Chase?

32:17.547 --> 32:18.548
Hold on.

32:20.015 --> 32:21.250
Let me in, it's me.

32:21.451 --> 32:22.519
Just a second!

32:26.355 --> 32:28.123
- Dude.
- One minute!

32:36.098 --> 32:38.200
- Why are the lights off?
- Pam, I need you.

32:38.233 --> 32:40.235
Just promise not to freak out.

32:41.236 --> 32:42.439
Chase, you're scaring me.

32:42.905 --> 32:44.073
Just promise.

32:45.508 --> 32:47.943
Okay, okay, okay,
what's wrong?

32:49.111 --> 32:50.245
Prepare yourself.

32:52.981 --> 32:58.053
Holy cow, or
not holy cow, unholy cow!

32:58.087 --> 33:01.491
- Oh my gosh, you're a vampire!
- Shh, don't say it so loud!

33:01.524 --> 33:02.991
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

33:03.393 --> 33:04.627
How did this happen?

33:04.661 --> 33:06.396
You're a vampire!

33:06.429 --> 33:08.631
Wait, were you about
to suck my blood?

33:08.665 --> 33:11.033
I can't believe I fell
for this trickery.

33:11.568 --> 33:12.569
I'm such a sucker.

33:13.503 --> 33:15.505
Or wait, you're such
a sucker.

33:15.538 --> 33:18.240
- Oh, I can't believe this.
- Stop! It's terrible.

33:18.273 --> 33:19.609
Remember at Sin's
first party when you

33:19.642 --> 33:21.544
were doing keg stands
and I was in the kitchen?

33:22.412 --> 33:24.913
Well, she made me drink
something that looked like blood.

33:25.448 --> 33:26.649
You drank blood?

33:26.683 --> 33:28.117
I thought it
was a hazing joke,

33:28.150 --> 33:30.052
like grape juice with
egg whites or something,

33:30.219 --> 33:32.321
so, yeah, I drank it,
but, ever since then,

33:32.489 --> 33:33.690
weird things have
been happening to me,

33:33.723 --> 33:36.892
and I think I almost ate
Sean Patrick just now.

33:38.260 --> 33:39.662
Oh, this makes so much sense,

33:39.696 --> 33:42.998
why Sin and Violet
and Lucy are so cool,

33:43.031 --> 33:44.534
by society's standards, that is.

33:44.567 --> 33:46.935
Pam, enough with your
"I'm too edgy" talk.

33:47.169 --> 33:51.541
It's okay, just breathe,
and think about bowling.

33:52.575 --> 33:54.411
- Why bowling?
- Just... just do it.

33:54.444 --> 33:57.580
Think about old ladies
winning at bowling.

33:58.715 --> 34:02.585
Old ladies, bowling,
old ladies, bowling.

34:08.991 --> 34:09.958
See?

34:10.926 --> 34:12.562
You're fine.
Now let's get back to the party.

34:12.594 --> 34:14.329
Really, all you can
think about is the party?

36:19.354 --> 36:20.790
<i>I'm glad
you're not mad at me</i>

36:20.823 --> 36:22.692
for the whole cheerleading
thing and now this.

36:22.725 --> 36:25.193
I can never be mad at you,
you're my best friend.

36:25.461 --> 36:27.129
Yeah, forever.

36:27.730 --> 36:31.734
So can you fly or jump really
high or anything like that?

36:32.468 --> 36:35.605
No, but all I know
is that I can see

36:35.638 --> 36:37.840
every single detail in a second,

36:37.874 --> 36:39.442
and then my teeth start to grow,

36:39.475 --> 36:42.344
and then it gets overwhelming.

36:42.612 --> 36:45.113
I knew this whole saying yes
thing was a good idea,

36:45.147 --> 36:46.849
but this is big time.

36:50.620 --> 36:53.188
Would Chase please
step up to the board

36:53.221 --> 36:56.859
and write the scansion for
the beginning of Richard III?

37:07.637 --> 37:09.171
Excuse me, Mr. Sosa,

37:09.204 --> 37:10.707
do you mind if I hang this
on your wall?

37:10.873 --> 37:12.240
No, go right ahead.

37:15.612 --> 37:18.448
So Ally's been missing
now for three days.

37:18.615 --> 37:19.716
If anyone's heard from her,

37:19.749 --> 37:20.783
can you please
tell an authority?

37:22.351 --> 37:23.519
I'm sure
she'll turn up.

37:23.886 --> 37:26.623
Now, Chase, if you
would, please explain.

37:32.662 --> 37:34.296
Um, actually,
can I go to the bathroom?

37:34.329 --> 37:36.198
- It's an emergency.
- Yes.

37:41.504 --> 37:44.239
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, hi, Carl, uh,

37:44.272 --> 37:46.241
I just have to go to the bathroom.
It's an emergency.

37:46.274 --> 37:47.275
I understand.

37:48.276 --> 37:49.812
Enchilada Wednesday.

38:02.692 --> 38:05.395
Calm down, Chase,
think of bowling.

38:05.862 --> 38:08.831
Bowling, bowling, bowling.

38:19.909 --> 38:20.710
I gotta get home.

38:22.712 --> 38:24.580
I think I learned
how to control it.

38:24.947 --> 38:27.550
I spent the rest of the
afternoon in my room practicing.

38:27.884 --> 38:28.918
Practicing?

38:29.719 --> 38:30.953
Trying to turn it off and on.

38:31.554 --> 38:33.321
Ooh, can I see it, please?

38:33.990 --> 38:35.825
Okay, but you should
keep the door open,

38:35.858 --> 38:37.593
and run out in case
I lose control.

38:43.666 --> 38:46.736
It's scary and amazing
all at the same time.

38:53.710 --> 38:55.210
Hey, Chase I, um, uh...

39:02.018 --> 39:03.586
I knew it, I knew it!

39:03.619 --> 39:04.887
Please, don't kill me, Chase!

39:05.320 --> 39:06.656
Dean, please, I can explain.

39:06.823 --> 39:08.290
Dean, it's gonna be okay.

39:08.323 --> 39:09.257
Please, don't kill me.

39:09.291 --> 39:11.594
You're a Nosferatu,
you're a devil's spawn,

39:11.627 --> 39:12.528
you're a vampire!

39:12.562 --> 39:14.864
Dean, I won't harm
a hair on your head.

39:17.299 --> 39:18.868
You have to promise
not to tell anybody,

39:18.901 --> 39:20.335
not even Mom or Dad.

39:20.368 --> 39:21.537
What the heck, Chase?

39:22.939 --> 39:25.340
My sister is a vampire, a real life
bloodsucker right in my own house!

39:25.373 --> 39:27.610
- Dean!
- I'm just so shocked.

39:27.643 --> 39:29.545
I sleep in the same room
as a vampire.

39:29.579 --> 39:30.880
I eat with a vampire.

39:30.913 --> 39:33.583
I pee in the same
restroom as a vampire!

39:33.916 --> 39:35.551
Do you even pee anymore, Chase?

39:35.585 --> 39:38.755
- Dean!
- Okay, I'm cool, I'm cool.

39:38.788 --> 39:41.323
I promise I will
explain everything,

39:41.356 --> 39:44.527
but, for right now, you have
to keep it a secret, please.

39:45.061 --> 39:48.231
Okay, big sis, but I'm sleeping
with garlic from now on.

39:48.631 --> 39:50.032
I'm gonna stock up
on some holy water.

39:55.037 --> 39:56.939
I actually think it was kind
of cute, the way he took it.

40:03.412 --> 40:04.647
Pretty good, guys.

40:07.683 --> 40:09.786
Look, there's Sean.
I'm so embarrassed.

40:09.819 --> 40:10.987
I just left him hanging there.

40:11.020 --> 40:13.389
Well, there are crazier
things going on in the world.

40:13.723 --> 40:14.924
Why don't you just
go talk to him?

40:15.825 --> 40:17.325
But what if he...

40:17.359 --> 40:19.428
Whatever your rebuttal is,
it's not the move.

40:19.462 --> 40:21.397
For goodness sakes,
you're a vampire.

40:21.430 --> 40:22.932
Go to talk to the human boy.

40:25.802 --> 40:26.936
Hey, Sean!

40:26.969 --> 40:27.970
One second, guys.

40:31.440 --> 40:32.542
Hey.

40:32.575 --> 40:34.342
I just wanted
to apologize.

40:36.746 --> 40:39.448
Um, I'm really sorry for
just running off like that.

40:39.849 --> 40:43.719
I kind of got nervous because
I've never been kissed before.

40:44.086 --> 40:46.589
I-I was nervous, too.
I kinda rushed it.

40:46.856 --> 40:48.925
We don't have to kiss,
if you don't want to.

40:49.425 --> 40:50.693
Oh, no, I do want to.

40:50.726 --> 40:52.728
Just maybe under
better circumstances.

40:52.995 --> 40:54.329
Yeah, like, uh, like what?

40:55.631 --> 40:56.666
How about a date?

40:57.400 --> 41:00.102
Yeah, yeah,
that sounds really fun.

41:00.603 --> 41:01.604
I'll pick you up Saturday?

41:02.004 --> 41:03.706
- It's a date.
- Sweet.

41:13.583 --> 41:15.117
So this is the Pig Stand,

41:15.151 --> 41:16.986
and it's been here
since the '50s,

41:17.019 --> 41:20.423
and every Saturday they have
a classic car and costume day.

41:20.890 --> 41:22.592
That's really cool.

41:23.192 --> 41:24.894
Can I be honest
with you for a second?

41:26.729 --> 41:29.699
I kinda didn't know you existed
until I saw you on the team.

41:30.867 --> 41:31.901
I'm really glad I met you.

41:32.835 --> 41:35.972
It's okay, I was
pretty invisible before.

41:37.139 --> 41:40.776
You know, Sean, I was pretty
scared of everything before,

41:40.810 --> 41:44.013
and I finally told myself that I
was gonna say yes to opportunities.

41:45.615 --> 41:47.783
Hey there, kiddos.

41:48.184 --> 41:50.753
Are we interrupting something?

41:51.621 --> 41:54.390
Actually, Sin,
we're on a date.

41:55.057 --> 41:57.460
A... a date?

41:58.060 --> 41:59.862
In this old place?

42:01.931 --> 42:04.767
I guess it never really
changes, does it?

42:05.134 --> 42:07.103
Some might say
it's our first date.

42:07.536 --> 42:12.174
Mm. Well, I will tell you
what, Chase, my dear,

42:12.942 --> 42:19.649
Sean is super scrumptious,
and just a definite 10.

42:20.917 --> 42:24.921
In fact, she could
just gobble you up,

42:24.954 --> 42:27.623
right here, in
front of everybody.

42:27.657 --> 42:30.426
Sin. What are you doing?

42:30.960 --> 42:32.828
Just having a little fun.

42:33.729 --> 42:34.964
Kudos to you.

42:36.065 --> 42:40.937
But I wouldn't tie my boat
into one dock just yet.

42:42.204 --> 42:47.076
There will be plenty of
other guys to gobble up.

42:47.109 --> 42:48.678
- Real funny, Sin.
- Sin!

42:50.246 --> 42:51.914
Or should we just
turn him now?

42:53.716 --> 42:54.784
Turn me into what?

42:56.552 --> 42:58.688
Turn you into...

43:01.724 --> 43:03.025
a male cheerleader.

43:06.996 --> 43:09.999
I am just messing
with you two lovebirds.

43:13.035 --> 43:18.174
I would think about where
your loyalties lie, though.

43:19.742 --> 43:23.612
With the squad or a with a boy.

43:26.549 --> 43:30.853
Hm. Well, anyways, tootles!

43:30.886 --> 43:33.723
We will be keeping an eye
on you two.

43:35.291 --> 43:36.826
It's just a little inside joke

43:36.859 --> 43:38.995
from when we all made
the cheerleading team.

43:39.829 --> 43:41.964
It's just Sin being Sin, right?

43:42.999 --> 43:44.500
Yeah, I guess.

43:45.267 --> 43:46.669
I guess I should head home.

43:47.770 --> 43:49.038
Yeah, no problem.

44:00.282 --> 44:01.851
I had a really
good time tonight.

44:02.318 --> 44:03.519
Me, too.

44:04.454 --> 44:05.588
That thing with Sin
was kind of weird.

44:05.621 --> 44:06.622
What did she mean?

44:07.023 --> 44:08.758
I can't really tell you.

44:09.091 --> 44:11.060
But I had a great time.

44:11.994 --> 44:13.863
- Goodnight.
- Yeah, okay.

44:13.896 --> 44:14.897
Goodnight.

44:30.646 --> 44:32.081
I'm glad you
ditched the boy toy.

44:32.681 --> 44:33.949
Did you happen to
drink from him?

44:34.683 --> 44:35.684
No, not yet.

44:39.321 --> 44:42.058
I thought my gentle
nudging would pay off,

44:42.091 --> 44:46.295
but I see you need
something stronger.

44:47.363 --> 44:48.564
What do you mean?

44:49.365 --> 44:50.666
Take my hand.

45:12.389 --> 45:16.358
This is
almost too easy, but...

45:19.962 --> 45:22.698
You, stay outside
and stand guard.

45:23.866 --> 45:28.070
Come on, girls,
let's do some damage.

45:57.434 --> 45:59.402
Uh, hello?

46:01.036 --> 46:03.639
Is... is somebody in here with me?

46:05.174 --> 46:07.877
Hello? Anybody in here?

46:08.411 --> 46:09.311
Schoo... school's closed.

46:09.345 --> 46:13.782
Oh! What is this? What?
What... oh, oh, oh!

46:32.935 --> 46:34.904
- Hey, kid.
- Yeah?

46:35.271 --> 46:38.140
I thought I told you not to sit
here anymore, comic book nerd.

46:38.174 --> 46:39.675
- Well, I...
- Well, what?

46:40.976 --> 46:42.344
You waiting for your favorite
comic book hero to come save you?

46:44.813 --> 46:47.216
Ow, ow, ow, stop it.

46:48.485 --> 46:50.453
- Ow!
- Hey, that's my little brother!

46:50.487 --> 46:51.720
What do you
think you're doing?

46:52.054 --> 46:53.155
Why don't you try that on me?

46:54.391 --> 46:55.891
You think I'm afraid of you
and this punk, Sean Patrick?

46:56.892 --> 46:59.028
All I know is if you
don't leave him alone,

46:59.061 --> 47:00.329
me and my baseball buddies
are gonna make

47:00.362 --> 47:02.097
this year very
difficult for you.

47:07.803 --> 47:08.804
Are you all right?

47:09.872 --> 47:11.140
Yeah, I'm fine, now that
you came to my rescue.

47:12.775 --> 47:17.346
Oh, Sean, this is Dean,
Dean, this is Sean, my... friend.

47:19.848 --> 47:21.484
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

47:22.218 --> 47:23.453
Do they mess with you a lot?

47:25.087 --> 47:26.121
Sometimes.

47:27.223 --> 47:27.957
I'll make sure they don't
mess with you anymore.

47:28.491 --> 47:29.358
Give me your phone.

47:29.392 --> 47:30.393
Oh, um...

47:30.826 --> 47:31.994
If you get in
anymore trouble,

47:32.395 --> 47:33.496
just give me a call, okay?

47:34.263 --> 47:35.264
Yeah.

47:37.333 --> 47:38.334
Thanks.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.841
You need to show
a little respect.

47:45.874 --> 47:47.977
- Respect?
- As captain of this team...

47:48.010 --> 47:50.946
Exactly, I'm captain.
Can you just not for a second?

47:50.980 --> 47:53.416
No, no, no, just stay here.
You can learn from this.

47:53.983 --> 47:56.352
When I speak to you as
captain of the team, I expect...

47:56.386 --> 47:58.988
The team, do you even
care about this team?

47:59.021 --> 48:01.357
I care deeply about this team.

48:01.391 --> 48:04.260
More than you will ever understand,

48:04.293 --> 48:05.861
- young lady.
- Really?

48:05.894 --> 48:07.497
You don't know
the things I go through

48:07.530 --> 48:08.864
to keep this team together.

48:09.865 --> 48:11.434
You are so ungrateful.

48:13.969 --> 48:16.005
You better change
this attitude by tomorrow

48:16.038 --> 48:19.174
or that captain position
might be in danger.

48:25.047 --> 48:26.449
Yes, master.

48:28.250 --> 48:30.252
Watch your attitude,
young lady.

48:32.422 --> 48:33.490
Pam, did you have a question?

48:34.524 --> 48:36.925
Oh, yes, do you want
me to do laundry tonight?

48:37.359 --> 48:39.928
Yes, and lock up
when you're through.

48:40.296 --> 48:42.998
- Yes, Miss Rooney.
- Bye-bye.

48:45.402 --> 48:46.935
What?

48:47.303 --> 48:49.071
She really gave
it to you, huh?

48:49.406 --> 48:51.006
Yeah, sorry about that.

48:51.907 --> 48:52.941
I'm gonna go do laundry.

48:53.876 --> 48:56.413
Please,
she's just an old lady

48:56.446 --> 48:58.180
who thinks she knows it all.

48:58.415 --> 49:00.282
Was I being careless, girls?

49:00.316 --> 49:02.318
- No way.
- You're never careless.

49:03.952 --> 49:06.021
Maybe it's time to give Rooney

49:06.055 --> 49:10.159
an attitude adjustment that
only we special girls can give.

49:10.627 --> 49:12.361
You don't wanna
hurt her, do you?

49:13.095 --> 49:14.564
Come on!

49:15.498 --> 49:17.232
It's time to get back at her.

49:18.100 --> 49:21.404
Chase, let's tell Pam that
you will fold the laundry

49:21.571 --> 49:22.938
and lock up for her.

49:24.073 --> 49:28.110
We are stealing Rooney's
precious trophy.

49:28.243 --> 49:30.079
And then, party at my house!

49:30.480 --> 49:32.848
Wait, wait,
you want me to lie to Pam?

49:33.248 --> 49:34.517
She's my best friend.

49:35.951 --> 49:37.554
You owe this to us

49:38.621 --> 49:41.624
for everything we have done
to make you cool.

49:42.224 --> 49:46.563
Popularity, cheerleading,

49:46.929 --> 49:49.499
boy toy.

49:50.667 --> 49:52.134
You can go now.

49:52.402 --> 49:54.303
I'll catch up to you!

50:16.559 --> 50:19.496
Pam, Pam, I can
finish doing the laundry

50:19.529 --> 50:21.096
and then lock up
Miss Rooney's office,

50:21.498 --> 50:23.298
and then you can just
meet us at Sin's party.

50:23.566 --> 50:25.100
You really don't have to.

50:25.134 --> 50:28.137
I mean, it's my job,
and I just wanna get it done

50:28.170 --> 50:29.439
before the big bowling game.

50:29.672 --> 50:31.408
Oh my gosh,
I completely forgot.

50:31.441 --> 50:32.442
Chase!

50:33.942 --> 50:37.146
Let me make it up to you.
I'll cover for you, and then you go home,

50:37.179 --> 50:39.416
get our Slayer shirts,
and then I'll finish

50:39.449 --> 50:41.250
doing the laundry and lock up,

50:41.283 --> 50:43.218
and just catch a ride
with Sin and the girls.

50:45.053 --> 50:47.222
Okay, but don't be late.

50:47.557 --> 50:49.426
Roberta and the Slayers
are counting on you.

50:49.459 --> 50:50.593
I'm counting on you.

50:51.694 --> 50:52.695
Come on.

50:54.329 --> 50:56.900
Between Sin's party
and being a Slayer,

50:57.299 --> 51:00.169
I'll always choose being
a Slayer, I promise.

51:17.186 --> 51:18.721
<i>Chase here,
can't talk, leave a message.</i>

51:18.755 --> 51:20.189
Hey, it's Sean.

51:20.590 --> 51:21.591
I just...

51:22.725 --> 51:24.226
Just give me a call back.

51:38.808 --> 51:42.479
Okay, Chase,
the trophy is on her desk.

51:42.512 --> 51:44.547
All you have to do
is just sneak in,

51:44.714 --> 51:46.649
grab it, and then it's ours.

51:48.618 --> 51:49.619
Why don't you do it?

51:50.185 --> 51:52.054
Because it's
pure silver, silly.

51:52.087 --> 51:54.223
We can't touch it without
it burning our skin.

51:54.524 --> 51:57.326
But since you haven't fully
turned, you can do it.

52:09.472 --> 52:11.006
Chase, where are you?

52:12.140 --> 52:13.141
You promised.

52:16.111 --> 52:18.013
- Hey, Pam.
- What are you doing here?

52:18.414 --> 52:19.782
I'm here to watch
the big victory

52:19.816 --> 52:21.751
with the two town
nerds' conquest.

52:22.284 --> 52:23.753
Yeah, if Chase ever shows up.

52:24.420 --> 52:26.321
I called her,
but she didn't answer.

52:26.355 --> 52:27.557
I left a couple of messages.

52:27.790 --> 52:30.192
That's so not Chase.

52:30.225 --> 52:31.728
Yeah, well, it is now.

52:32.094 --> 52:33.663
I guess she'd rather hang out
with the cheerleaders

52:33.696 --> 52:34.797
than with me, bowling.

52:35.832 --> 52:38.033
I bet she's partying at
Sin's house as we speak.

52:40.369 --> 52:41.704
Very funny guys.

52:45.140 --> 52:46.776
Chase, what are you
doing in my office?

52:48.444 --> 52:51.179
Uh... I...

52:52.347 --> 52:54.584
I was doing laundry for Pam.

52:55.485 --> 52:57.152
And why are you
holding my trophy?

53:01.256 --> 53:02.257
Explain yourself!

53:03.459 --> 53:05.595
Are you trying to steal
my precious trophy?

53:06.328 --> 53:07.664
Did Sin put you up to this?

53:08.263 --> 53:11.333
I'd expect it from her,
but never from you.

53:12.367 --> 53:14.437
No, I did this all by myself.

53:15.638 --> 53:18.708
I don't even think I can
explain why, honestly.

53:20.443 --> 53:22.077
Well, I'm sure you can't,

53:22.812 --> 53:23.913
but that is all the more reason

53:23.947 --> 53:28.350
I have to tell you you are off
the cheerleading team.

53:32.889 --> 53:34.089
I understand.

53:35.491 --> 53:37.527
I won't be pressing charges
or anything like that,

53:37.894 --> 53:39.729
so I hope you're grateful,

53:40.295 --> 53:42.498
but I will be
contacting your parents.

53:43.700 --> 53:45.668
I just never expected
this type of behavior

53:45.702 --> 53:48.638
from that sweet girl I met
at the beginning of the year.

53:50.372 --> 53:53.509
So you best get out of my office before
I change my mind about pressing charges.

53:54.777 --> 53:56.679
I am so disappointed.

54:03.853 --> 54:06.656
- What's going on, Chase?
- What the heck, Sin?

54:07.657 --> 54:10.225
What, it didn't go well
with Miss Rooney?

54:10.526 --> 54:12.127
She just kicked
me off the team.

54:12.528 --> 54:14.597
Did you rat us out?

54:14.931 --> 54:17.400
No, I took the blame.

54:17.433 --> 54:19.936
What would you say
if I told you

54:19.969 --> 54:22.672
I could make something
different happen?

54:23.439 --> 54:24.474
What do you mean?

54:25.708 --> 54:29.244
How badly do you wanna be
back on this cheerleading squad?

54:29.545 --> 54:31.146
It's the best thing
to ever happen to me.

54:31.414 --> 54:34.316
Being a full vampire
comes with a lot of power.

54:35.451 --> 54:36.552
How can I do that?

54:37.754 --> 54:39.889
This could've
all been avoided

54:39.922 --> 54:42.659
if you had just
completed step two.

54:42.692 --> 54:43.793
What do I need to do?

54:54.937 --> 54:59.575
I want you to kill Pam
and drink her blood.

55:01.644 --> 55:02.612
What?

55:05.848 --> 55:10.887
And gain all of the popularity
and power you ever wanted.

55:12.588 --> 55:13.589
Forever.

55:15.692 --> 55:17.560
Or suffer the consequences.

55:18.995 --> 55:21.296
No, I'm sorry,
I can't do that.

55:21.329 --> 55:23.733
I'm not cut out for this
whole vampire thing.

55:24.634 --> 55:26.869
Oh, I see.

55:27.603 --> 55:29.204
Then you must die.

55:30.338 --> 55:31.407
Come get her, girls.

55:33.876 --> 55:35.611
- Take her to my house.
- No, let go!

55:35.645 --> 55:39.281
And don't forget
to get Pam.

55:46.756 --> 55:48.524
I guess you'll have to
forfeit the game

55:48.691 --> 55:50.593
since your other
player didn't show up.

55:50.760 --> 55:53.596
Uh, can... can we just wait
10 more minutes, please?

55:53.629 --> 55:56.231
I'm sorry, rules are rules.

55:56.499 --> 55:58.233
The other team wins by default.

56:00.770 --> 56:04.474
I'm sorry, Pam,
better luck next time.

56:16.652 --> 56:17.653
Where you going?

56:18.554 --> 56:20.022
I can't believe
she didn't show up.

56:21.356 --> 56:23.291
Maybe that's what real cheerleaders
do, ditch their friends.

56:38.775 --> 56:41.444
Hey!
Hey, let go of me!

56:41.944 --> 56:43.780
Help, please!

56:51.721 --> 56:54.090
Hey, yeah, it's Dean,
I need you immediately.

56:54.123 --> 56:55.558
Meet me at the bowling alley.

57:08.971 --> 57:09.972
Get in.

57:12.975 --> 57:13.976
Drive.

57:20.716 --> 57:23.386
Okay, hold up,
what's going on?

57:23.419 --> 57:24.453
Have you seen your sister?

57:24.787 --> 57:26.389
I need you to listen to me.

57:26.823 --> 57:29.559
No matter how crazy this sounds,
you have to believe me.

57:29.592 --> 57:30.660
What are you talking about?

57:31.027 --> 57:32.728
I just saw Pam get kidnapped.

57:32.862 --> 57:33.996
What?

57:34.030 --> 57:36.732
Well wait, it was by vampires.

57:38.701 --> 57:39.802
Are you being serious?

57:39.836 --> 57:40.903
I mean, shouldn't we
call the cops?

57:40.937 --> 57:42.939
No! I'm more serious
than a heart attack.

57:43.439 --> 57:46.442
Our school has been overrun
with an infestation of vampires.

57:46.475 --> 57:48.010
Okay, that's crazy, I mean.

57:48.477 --> 57:49.412
Isn't it?

57:49.445 --> 57:51.113
Haven't you noticed
how all those new girls

57:51.147 --> 57:53.816
just came in and they suddenly
became really popular,

57:53.850 --> 57:55.651
and then just started
to run the cheerleaders.

57:55.818 --> 57:56.919
Yeah, but that's not crazy...

57:56.953 --> 57:58.988
And that's when all the kids
started to go missing.

57:59.589 --> 58:02.859
Even Carl the janitor, and he's
been working there for 20 years.

58:03.159 --> 58:04.527
And Chase is one of them.

58:05.761 --> 58:06.863
Okay, you're crazy.

58:08.931 --> 58:11.033
You know what, fine,
I know what to do.

58:11.067 --> 58:12.702
Just drive us back to my house.

58:13.169 --> 58:15.471
Okay, wacko, whatever you say.

58:16.172 --> 58:17.473
Maybe Chase will be there.

58:31.921 --> 58:33.623
Okay, what are we doing here?

58:34.590 --> 58:36.392
Chase isn't a full vampire.

58:36.592 --> 58:37.894
If she was,
she would've hunted me

58:37.927 --> 58:39.395
and my entire family by now.

58:40.029 --> 58:42.131
Heck, you probably would've
been her first victim.

58:43.900 --> 58:46.469
I think Sin, Violet,
and Lucy have been coming

58:46.502 --> 58:48.070
to our school
to feed and recruit.

58:48.871 --> 58:50.740
In fact, I even think
they killed Mrs. Becca.

58:51.540 --> 58:52.642
The old cheerleading coach?

58:52.942 --> 58:53.943
Yeah.

58:55.144 --> 58:56.679
And they've been feeding on
our school this whole time.

58:57.747 --> 58:59.515
Isn't it weird how so
many kids just go missing?

58:59.782 --> 59:01.183
If we wanna save Chase and Pam,

59:01.217 --> 59:02.785
the first thing we're
gonna have to do

59:02.818 --> 59:05.788
is find out who the head
vampire is and kill her.

59:06.689 --> 59:07.857
You're joking, right?

59:09.025 --> 59:12.128
Trust me, I've been preparing
for this my entire life.

59:12.662 --> 59:14.063
Okay, how have
you been preparing?

59:16.966 --> 59:17.967
Comic books?

59:18.935 --> 59:21.971
I hate to do
this to you, buddy,

59:22.004 --> 59:25.107
but it's finally time
for you to grow up.

59:26.943 --> 59:27.843
Okay.

59:27.877 --> 59:29.679
My parents went to
the same high school

59:29.712 --> 59:31.213
when they were younger,
so I bet if we flip

59:31.247 --> 59:33.215
through these yearbooks, we'll
find what we're looking for.

59:34.850 --> 59:37.119
They must be switching schools
in order to not get caught.

59:37.987 --> 59:39.789
Then they return
every 20 years to feed

59:39.822 --> 59:41.557
and start another
high school term.

59:45.728 --> 59:47.163
- No way.
- What?

59:47.897 --> 59:48.931
Check this out.

59:50.232 --> 59:51.200
I knew it!

59:51.233 --> 59:53.736
Sin is the leader of
this bloodsucking group.

59:54.003 --> 59:54.904
We have to kill her.

59:54.937 --> 59:56.872
Okay, okay, how
are we gonna do that?

59:57.273 --> 01:00:01.477
Um, Pam said something about
Chase going to a party.

01:00:02.211 --> 01:00:03.179
Sin's house.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.750
All right, it's time to
kill some damn vampires.

01:00:09.852 --> 01:00:10.920
I'm still pissed off.

01:00:11.887 --> 01:00:12.922
Dude, we're in a bunch
of trouble right now

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:15.057
and all you can think about is
that stupid bowling game tonight?

01:00:15.091 --> 01:00:16.826
This was our
one chance to beat

01:00:16.859 --> 01:00:17.860
the other team, and we blew it.

01:00:18.294 --> 01:00:20.229
No, no, no, you blew it,
and decided to mess around

01:00:20.262 --> 01:00:22.131
instead of doing
what we planned!

01:00:22.832 --> 01:00:23.933
I'm sorry.

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:26.602
And, most of all,
you let me down.

01:00:27.036 --> 01:00:29.038
You said that no matter
how cool you became

01:00:29.071 --> 01:00:31.507
we would still be
friends forever.

01:00:32.141 --> 01:00:33.142
I should've known.

01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:35.144
I should've known that
you would always choose

01:00:35.177 --> 01:00:37.813
being friends with Sin
and becoming a cheerleader

01:00:37.847 --> 01:00:39.815
over your supposed best friend.

01:00:39.849 --> 01:00:41.917
Come on, I just wanted
to fit in for once.

01:00:41.951 --> 01:00:43.819
I can't trust you anymore.

01:00:45.654 --> 01:00:46.789
What are you gonna do to us?

01:00:47.189 --> 01:00:48.324
Shut up.

01:00:48.357 --> 01:00:49.925
You're coming with us.

01:00:51.093 --> 01:00:52.528
You two
better not hurt her.

01:00:53.195 --> 01:00:54.530
Take her to the house.

01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:55.931
I'm gonna talk to her.

01:01:12.615 --> 01:01:13.949
Mmm.

01:01:41.243 --> 01:01:43.145
You know why you're here, right?

01:01:43.946 --> 01:01:45.147
Because you wanna kill me.

01:01:46.115 --> 01:01:47.116
Nope.

01:01:50.286 --> 01:01:51.587
Then why am I here?

01:01:53.189 --> 01:01:56.659
Tonight is initiation night.

01:01:58.661 --> 01:02:01.964
Like we did for Chase,
I want to make you

01:02:01.997 --> 01:02:04.834
popular and pretty.

01:02:05.267 --> 01:02:09.371
Tonight is your night
to join forces with us.

01:02:12.074 --> 01:02:14.743
You are the chosen one,

01:02:15.244 --> 01:02:19.748
the girl that we want to have
everlasting beauty.

01:02:25.354 --> 01:02:28.757
Now, drink this blood.

01:02:33.896 --> 01:02:36.632
It's your turn to be popular,

01:02:37.467 --> 01:02:41.871
not just the sideline
water-girl for Mrs. Rooney.

01:02:45.774 --> 01:02:51.046
Hmm. Admit it,
you wanna be popular,

01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:56.785
just like everyone else.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.921
Now...

01:03:01.157 --> 01:03:05.161
your cheerleading
uniform is waiting for you.

01:03:06.195 --> 01:03:13.135
Drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink, drink.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.443
Listen to me...
very carefully.

01:03:21.844 --> 01:03:26.048
Your life could depend
on my every word.

01:03:26.449 --> 01:03:27.783
- Okay.
- Fill these up.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:30.319
If you get a chance,
shoot those bloodsuckers

01:03:30.352 --> 01:03:32.955
in the face with
these holy water guns.

01:03:34.457 --> 01:03:36.058
Dude, how'd you
get so much holy water?

01:03:36.493 --> 01:03:37.893
Ah, religious grandmother.

01:03:39.396 --> 01:03:40.696
If that doesn't work,

01:03:42.097 --> 01:03:43.365
we're gonna have to go with the
good old stake through the heart!

01:03:44.166 --> 01:03:45.367
I made these myself.

01:03:46.368 --> 01:03:47.803
Nice.

01:03:47.836 --> 01:03:50.339
Yeah. I've been prepping
since day one.

01:03:53.108 --> 01:03:55.744
Oh, these won't kill.

01:03:56.845 --> 01:03:57.846
They're deterrents.

01:03:59.281 --> 01:04:01.484
Also, I should mention that if you
have any silver bullets or knives,

01:04:01.518 --> 01:04:03.085
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

01:04:03.118 --> 01:04:05.455
Okay. No bullets,
no silver knives.

01:04:05.488 --> 01:04:06.822
At least not on me.

01:04:06.855 --> 01:04:07.990
Are you sure this is gonna work?

01:04:08.991 --> 01:04:10.292
Do vampires suck?

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:15.998
Finally, I want you
to coat the stakes

01:04:16.031 --> 01:04:19.268
with this garlic powder so we
can stab the vampires easier.

01:04:20.102 --> 01:04:22.104
Okay, so we are gonna
have to do some killing?

01:04:22.137 --> 01:04:23.406
Don't be scared, little buddy.

01:04:23.872 --> 01:04:25.007
It's my turn to pay you back.

01:04:26.175 --> 01:04:29.878
Bullies scare me, but vampires,
vampires I can handle.

01:04:45.894 --> 01:04:46.895
Let's go get Sin.

01:05:05.548 --> 01:05:06.549
I tricked you.

01:05:08.951 --> 01:05:11.287
You really are the victim here.

01:05:12.288 --> 01:05:13.889
Your little friend
Pam has given in

01:05:13.922 --> 01:05:16.526
to exactly
what I wanted her to do.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:21.196
You see, Pam has chosen
popularity and power

01:05:21.464 --> 01:05:23.466
over your friendship.

01:05:24.567 --> 01:05:25.901
She's now going to
drink your blood

01:05:25.934 --> 01:05:27.570
and become a full vampire.

01:05:31.206 --> 01:05:32.808
It could've gone the other way,

01:05:34.209 --> 01:05:36.078
if only you could've
made the right decision.

01:05:37.346 --> 01:05:40.115
Hmm. Now it's her turn.

01:05:40.483 --> 01:05:41.817
I don't believe you.

01:05:42.351 --> 01:05:44.086
Pam doesn't care
about being popular.

01:05:45.187 --> 01:05:47.356
Pam always wanted
to be popular.

01:05:48.324 --> 01:05:49.958
For being best friends,

01:05:50.192 --> 01:05:52.595
I can't believe you couldn't
see past her façade.

01:05:54.597 --> 01:05:56.065
So is
this what you do?

01:05:56.433 --> 01:05:58.435
What do you mean what I do?

01:05:59.201 --> 01:06:01.337
You go from high school
to high school,

01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:03.939
recruiting innocent girls
to become vampires.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.008
Innocent?

01:06:07.209 --> 01:06:11.614
I recall seeing your mind
the minute I bumped into you.

01:06:12.247 --> 01:06:15.351
You were going to say yes
to anything this year.

01:06:15.385 --> 01:06:18.253
You were going to
ask Sean Patrick out.

01:06:18.655 --> 01:06:21.123
And I knew you were
going to drink the blood

01:06:21.357 --> 01:06:24.394
just to be a silly cheerleader.

01:06:25.662 --> 01:06:27.863
But, yes, that's
precisely what we do.

01:06:28.964 --> 01:06:31.835
You made it seem like the most
amazing thing in the world.

01:06:32.067 --> 01:06:36.338
Oh, it once was,
a very, very long time ago,

01:06:36.539 --> 01:06:38.273
you naïve little girl.

01:06:39.676 --> 01:06:41.143
So how old are you?

01:06:41.176 --> 01:06:45.114
Old enough to be
your mother, young lady!

01:06:47.983 --> 01:06:48.984
Boop.

01:06:51.554 --> 01:06:53.390
So do you ever think
about being normal?

01:07:02.565 --> 01:07:09.171
Every night since
I started my new life.

01:07:12.542 --> 01:07:16.111
But that is not possible,
and, if we don't feed,

01:07:16.145 --> 01:07:19.014
we get weak and disgusting,
yet we never die.

01:07:19.047 --> 01:07:21.950
It's tragic, actually.

01:07:24.421 --> 01:07:31.026
And yet being a vampire
is so much more fun

01:07:31.059 --> 01:07:36.198
than being a good little loser.

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:42.605
You're ugly under that
fake smile, vampire or not.

01:07:43.573 --> 01:07:47.209
Aw, to think
I had my money on you

01:07:47.242 --> 01:07:49.344
drinking Sean Patrick's blood.

01:07:49.712 --> 01:07:56.118
Heart beating, hairs
raising, blood pumping.

01:08:00.055 --> 01:08:02.525
But you disappointed me.

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:08.063
You were and are just weak.

01:08:09.632 --> 01:08:11.668
Pam won't fail us.

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.101
You're wrong!

01:08:14.102 --> 01:08:15.738
She's already joined us
and is coming here

01:08:15.772 --> 01:08:18.372
to do what you couldn't.

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:40.154
Whoa!

01:09:40.188 --> 01:09:42.825
Whoa, whoa, no, sorry, sorry!

01:09:42.859 --> 01:09:44.460
Just... let's... let's keep going.

01:09:45.294 --> 01:09:46.563
What the hell
are you doing?

01:10:04.146 --> 01:10:05.748
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:10:06.348 --> 01:10:07.450
Wrong way.

01:10:09.419 --> 01:10:10.420
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:10:12.488 --> 01:10:14.323
This looks like a really
good spot to set a trap.

01:10:44.787 --> 01:10:46.154
Pam!

01:10:46.188 --> 01:10:48.625
What happened to you?
Why are you wearing a cheerleading outfit?

01:10:49.191 --> 01:10:50.158
Shut up, loser!

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.629
You think Pam cares about you?

01:10:54.262 --> 01:10:55.263
Chase.

01:10:56.399 --> 01:10:58.468
I don't care about you.

01:10:58.968 --> 01:11:03.806
You knew I wanted to be on
the team, and you took my spot.

01:11:04.407 --> 01:11:05.642
Did you think for one minute

01:11:05.675 --> 01:11:07.410
that I didn't want
to be like you?

01:11:07.877 --> 01:11:08.878
I didn't know.

01:11:09.679 --> 01:11:11.279
I don't understand, Pam.

01:11:12.815 --> 01:11:13.816
Do it, Pam.

01:11:14.917 --> 01:11:17.285
This is a pure silver knife.

01:11:17.954 --> 01:11:21.891
Silver is the only thing
that can kill us vampires.

01:11:22.659 --> 01:11:24.694
But only if you stab
her in the heart.

01:11:25.828 --> 01:11:27.563
Do what you need to do,

01:11:28.464 --> 01:11:31.868
what your best friend
was going to do to you.

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.704
That's a lie,
I refused to hurt you, Pam.

01:11:34.971 --> 01:11:38.408
She was going to kill you and
then drink Sean Patrick's blood.

01:11:39.442 --> 01:11:42.478
Now I want you to kill her,

01:11:42.979 --> 01:11:45.313
and then you can go
drink Sean Patrick's blood

01:11:45.848 --> 01:11:47.717
and finish becoming one of us.

01:11:50.553 --> 01:11:51.721
Don't listen to her, Pam.

01:11:51.988 --> 01:11:53.890
I never meant to hurt you,
I'm so sorry.

01:11:54.791 --> 01:11:59.294
You kept me from being
popular my entire life.

01:12:00.563 --> 01:12:03.331
Now it's my turn to be popular.

01:12:04.567 --> 01:12:07.970
You're my best friend,
don't forget that.

01:12:09.739 --> 01:12:14.711
You want this, you need it.

01:12:16.344 --> 01:12:18.381
You were always
the better friend.

01:12:19.982 --> 01:12:22.284
Now it's your turn
to be cool.

01:12:24.387 --> 01:12:26.923
Pam, Pam, Pam.

01:12:27.289 --> 01:12:28.825
It's your destiny!

01:12:28.858 --> 01:12:32.260
Pam, Pam,
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam,

01:12:32.294 --> 01:12:36.566
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam.

01:12:36.599 --> 01:12:38.868
Slayers never die,
we bowl like lightning.

01:12:43.371 --> 01:12:44.507
And strike like thunder.

01:12:45.041 --> 01:12:46.241
What does that mean?

01:12:57.487 --> 01:12:59.489
- Those girls are vampires.
- Believe me, we know.

01:12:59.789 --> 01:13:00.823
So you know about me, too?

01:13:00.857 --> 01:13:03.325
Let's split up and hunt
these type O-negatives.

01:13:38.094 --> 01:13:40.396
You're
going to die, Sean Patrick.

01:13:44.934 --> 01:13:46.002
Pam, catch!

01:13:52.708 --> 01:13:53.810
Yes!

01:13:53.843 --> 01:13:55.011
- Damn it, Dean.
- Sorry.

01:13:55.511 --> 01:13:57.046
That was just really cool.

01:13:57.446 --> 01:13:58.548
Let's go.

01:14:01.117 --> 01:14:03.553
I am
going to drink your blood

01:14:03.586 --> 01:14:06.823
and finish what Chase
could not.

01:14:07.123 --> 01:14:09.959
If you're that thirsty,
you should go for a swim.

01:14:21.137 --> 01:14:22.839
Sean, I just wanted
to say I'm really sorry

01:14:22.872 --> 01:14:25.107
for getting you involved
in this crazy vampire mess.

01:14:25.141 --> 01:14:27.877
It's okay, I had no idea
how much trouble you were in.

01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:29.111
I mean, this is crazy.

01:14:29.745 --> 01:14:31.681
Yeah, and thank you
for protecting Dean,

01:14:31.714 --> 01:14:32.748
and coming to help us.

01:14:34.383 --> 01:14:35.818
Are you kidding me? Your brother was
the brains behind the whole operation.

01:14:36.886 --> 01:14:38.821
I just wanted to say,
before this,

01:14:38.855 --> 01:14:41.557
I was invisible, and all
I wanted was for kids like you

01:14:41.591 --> 01:14:42.625
to actually see me.

01:14:43.626 --> 01:14:45.394
I drank blood and
I betrayed my best friend

01:14:45.428 --> 01:14:49.031
when all I really wanted
was a kiss from Sean Patrick,

01:14:49.632 --> 01:14:53.069
so, before we go to
our certain doom,

01:14:56.172 --> 01:14:57.640
gimme some sugar, baby.

01:15:22.164 --> 01:15:24.033
Whoa!

01:15:24.066 --> 01:15:25.835
Uh, don't mean to
rain on your parade,

01:15:25.868 --> 01:15:27.436
but we have
a head vampire to kill.

01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:29.005
- Are you guys okay?
- We killed Violet.

01:15:29.038 --> 01:15:32.008
- We killed Lucy.
- No offense, sis, I thought you were gross,

01:15:32.041 --> 01:15:33.676
but those other vampires
sure are grosser

01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:35.511
in real life than they
are in the comics.

01:15:35.544 --> 01:15:37.046
Thanks for
the compliment, Dean.

01:15:37.513 --> 01:15:39.448
Never really thought those
comic books would come in handy.

01:15:39.482 --> 01:15:41.717
Now all we have to do is
kill the head vampire, Sin,

01:15:42.051 --> 01:15:43.586
then you'll return
to being fully human,

01:15:43.753 --> 01:15:44.787
my mean old sister again.

01:15:48.557 --> 01:15:50.059
I think she's waiting
for us in the woods.

01:15:50.092 --> 01:15:51.193
Let's go get her then.

01:16:02.238 --> 01:16:04.707
I See Violet and
Lucy didn't make it.

01:16:05.908 --> 01:16:07.209
Too bad, too sad.

01:16:07.777 --> 01:16:08.744
They were weak.

01:16:10.579 --> 01:16:12.581
No wonder you
never really had any friends.

01:16:45.014 --> 01:16:48.250
I see you brought your
tag-along, loser brother.

01:16:48.884 --> 01:16:50.953
I'm looking forward
to drinking his blood.

01:16:51.287 --> 01:16:52.088
Hey!

01:16:53.022 --> 01:16:56.625
Oh, and Pam,
always the puppy dog,

01:16:57.126 --> 01:16:59.228
following Chase into loserdom.

01:16:59.261 --> 01:17:00.262
Stop it, Sin.

01:17:01.263 --> 01:17:02.898
Oh, and of course you
brought your boy toy.

01:17:03.265 --> 01:17:04.500
I mean, I practically
handed him to you

01:17:04.533 --> 01:17:09.038
on a plate, and, yet, you still
refused to drink his blood.

01:17:26.322 --> 01:17:27.223
No!

01:17:27.256 --> 01:17:29.058
Well, what are you
waiting for, loser?

01:17:30.126 --> 01:17:31.527
Don't you wanna kill me?

01:17:36.665 --> 01:17:38.734
You can't be afraid
to take risks in life.

01:17:38.768 --> 01:17:40.136
You gotta take
risks without losing

01:17:40.169 --> 01:17:41.771
who you are or those you love.

01:17:41.804 --> 01:17:44.607
I lost myself in
your little fantasy

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.308
of becoming cool and popular.

01:17:46.342 --> 01:17:48.811
I became arrogant, like you,

01:17:49.178 --> 01:17:52.214
and I told myself that no matter what
happens at the end of senior year,

01:17:52.248 --> 01:17:54.050
this was gonna be
the best year ever,

01:17:54.083 --> 01:17:56.085
and I was gonna say
yes to opportunities.

01:17:56.819 --> 01:17:59.889
So, yes, Sin,
I say come get some.

01:18:05.628 --> 01:18:08.798
You know,
we shouldn't be doing this.

01:18:08.964 --> 01:18:10.733
We should rule
the school together.

01:18:11.734 --> 01:18:12.701
Get up!

01:18:18.174 --> 01:18:19.308
Enough of your lies, Sin.

01:18:33.122 --> 01:18:36.659
You know,
I never asked for this.

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:40.296
I didn't get a choice
like you're getting.

01:18:41.263 --> 01:18:44.100
All you have to do
is finish off Sean there,

01:18:44.333 --> 01:18:47.269
and we can be powerful together.

01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:48.971
Forever.

01:18:52.708 --> 01:18:58.013
You can either be cool
forever or just another nerd

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:02.885
with loser friends who likes
to bowl with old people.

01:19:09.024 --> 01:19:10.726
You're not gonna beat me.

01:19:23.406 --> 01:19:24.773
I can't breathe.

01:19:25.841 --> 01:19:26.809
Let her go!

01:19:27.209 --> 01:19:28.644
Chase.

01:19:31.381 --> 01:19:32.648
Your fight's with me.

01:19:35.184 --> 01:19:37.319
You're dead meat.

01:19:38.053 --> 01:19:40.423
Even if it was between
my best friend,

01:19:40.457 --> 01:19:41.891
brother, and guy I like,

01:19:43.092 --> 01:19:44.894
even if it was between being
a cheerleader and a Slayer,

01:19:44.927 --> 01:19:46.429
I don't need immortality, Sin.

01:19:46.463 --> 01:19:47.663
I like who I am.

01:20:11.421 --> 01:20:14.823
I will always be
a Slayer at heart.

01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:23.199
- Did you do it?
- I did.

01:20:23.832 --> 01:20:25.100
Sorry for the crazy year.

01:20:26.068 --> 01:20:27.803
No worries.

01:20:28.003 --> 01:20:29.238
It's been the best year yet.

01:20:30.039 --> 01:20:32.308
So did it work?

01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:33.476
Of course it did.

01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:35.144
I'd tell you to
go look in a mirror,

01:20:35.311 --> 01:20:37.112
but I'm not sure you'd
have a reflection.

01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:49.459
What are you
kids doing up so late?

01:20:50.993 --> 01:20:53.396
I came to apologize
to Sin for today.

01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:55.231
Did she have a party?

01:20:59.235 --> 01:21:01.870
Miss Rooney, you won't believe
what's happening at the school.

01:21:03.005 --> 01:21:05.274
Oh, tell me, sweetheart.

01:21:06.275 --> 01:21:07.977
Whatever are you talking about?

01:21:08.411 --> 01:21:11.381
There are vampires, real,
bloodsucking vampires,

01:21:11.414 --> 01:21:12.848
killing the kids at the school,

01:21:12.881 --> 01:21:14.750
and they tried to turn
Chase into one of them.

01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:16.519
And they were all on
your cheerleading team.

01:21:16.986 --> 01:21:19.355
We killed Violet,
we killed Lucy,

01:21:19.389 --> 01:21:20.990
we definitely killed
Sin because we thought

01:21:21.023 --> 01:21:24.126
she was the head vampire,
but Chase is still a vampire,

01:21:24.159 --> 01:21:26.295
which means she wasn't
the leader, which means...

01:21:33.503 --> 01:21:36.238
Let's just
say graduation's coming

01:21:36.272 --> 01:21:40.510
early for y'all
this year.

01:21:44.481 --> 01:21:45.515
But, Mrs. Rooney...

01:21:45.914 --> 01:21:48.050
Oh, don't be
such a little baby.

01:21:48.451 --> 01:21:50.019
I always like the girls to fight

01:21:50.052 --> 01:21:52.021
for the top spot on my team,

01:21:52.555 --> 01:21:54.424
and now, thanks to you,

01:21:55.291 --> 01:21:59.128
it seems there's plenty of
room for fresh blood.

01:22:00.597 --> 01:22:02.465
Did you really
think you fooled me?

01:22:03.299 --> 01:22:05.801
I knew Sin put you up
to stealing from me.

01:22:07.604 --> 01:22:11.040
Pam, such a shame.

01:22:11.474 --> 01:22:13.543
I really thought,
with a little encouragement,

01:22:13.576 --> 01:22:15.210
you'd finally make
it on the team.

01:22:16.479 --> 01:22:21.350
And, Chase, if you wanted
all these boys around,

01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:23.420
why didn't you just ask?

01:22:23.952 --> 01:22:25.888
We just killed your
head cheerleader.

01:22:26.955 --> 01:22:28.491
Oh, Sin was getting boring.

01:22:29.291 --> 01:22:32.027
Besides, she was
using Chase to steal

01:22:32.061 --> 01:22:34.229
the only thing that
could possibly hurt me.

01:22:36.098 --> 01:22:37.900
This was actually a silver cross

01:22:37.933 --> 01:22:39.968
before I had it
melted into this.

01:22:41.103 --> 01:22:44.973
I killed my own master with it,
so can't blame her.

01:22:46.241 --> 01:22:50.379
Still, serves her right
for not having manners.

01:22:55.385 --> 01:22:59.121
You know, I really
enjoy the smell of garlic, but nice try.

01:23:04.527 --> 01:23:05.562
Spicy!

01:23:05.595 --> 01:23:09.164
That stopped working on me
decades and decades ago.

01:23:09.466 --> 01:23:11.401
Oh, and that cross
around your neck,

01:23:12.201 --> 01:23:13.403
didn't even make me blink.

01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:20.976
Oh, come on, Chase,
just join my team.

01:23:21.009 --> 01:23:24.113
All of you, or I'll have
to turn this cutie pie

01:23:24.146 --> 01:23:25.615
into my late night snack.

01:23:25.648 --> 01:23:27.950
- Don't do it, Chase.
- Hush now.

01:23:29.386 --> 01:23:30.487
Well,

01:23:31.554 --> 01:23:32.655
what'll it be, dear?

01:23:34.256 --> 01:23:37.660
Hey you, are you ready
for some Holy Roller?

01:23:44.166 --> 01:23:45.167
Strike.

01:23:54.376 --> 01:23:56.311
You know, girls,
there are better ways

01:23:56.345 --> 01:24:00.182
to get better at bowling
than to become vampires.

01:24:18.601 --> 01:24:20.135
Come on,
let's go home.

01:24:24.339 --> 01:24:26.476
And then I just punched him
right in the face.

01:24:26.609 --> 01:24:28.277
And I kissed her,
right on the lips.

01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:29.579
Right in the face?

01:24:29.612 --> 01:24:31.313
Also, that's pretty gross.

01:24:31.346 --> 01:24:32.682
Well.

01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:35.184
Oh, that bruise.

01:24:35.452 --> 01:24:36.686
You know, the next time you try

01:24:36.719 --> 01:24:38.655
one of those crazy
cheerleading tricks,

01:24:39.021 --> 01:24:40.222
you should use a mat.

01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:42.625
No more cheerleading for me.

01:24:43.225 --> 01:24:44.226
It sucked.

01:24:45.093 --> 01:24:46.696
Oh, really?

01:24:46.729 --> 01:24:48.565
Yeah, I'm just happy to be me,

01:24:48.598 --> 01:24:51.233
a bowling nerd with my best
friend in the whole world.

01:24:51.266 --> 01:24:52.469
That's just great to hear.

01:24:53.736 --> 01:24:55.638
Oh, that's Pam,
I better be going.

01:24:55.672 --> 01:24:57.973
We're practicing for next
year's bowling tournament.

01:24:58.508 --> 01:24:59.975
Okay, be safe, honey.

01:25:02.144 --> 01:25:04.980
You coming
or what?

01:25:06.315 --> 01:25:07.316
You bet I am.

01:25:14.791 --> 01:25:16.325
I won't be needing these today.

01:25:18.461 --> 01:25:19.462
Wait up!

01:25:30.807 --> 01:25:32.374
Hey, guys, ready?

01:25:34.276 --> 01:25:36.412
Let's practice hard to
win this year's tournament.

01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:40.115
Hey, Chase, you still
thinking about joining

01:25:40.148 --> 01:25:41.384
the Guinness Book
of World Records

01:25:41.417 --> 01:25:43.118
for girl who loses
the most games in bowling

01:25:43.151 --> 01:25:44.219
again this year?

01:25:50.158 --> 01:25:52.027
You peed your pants.

01:27:07.269 --> 01:27:08.303
Buckled up?

01:27:09.405 --> 01:27:10.607
Safety first, kids.

01:27:12.508 --> 01:27:13.610
If you're watching this, hi.

01:27:16.378 --> 01:27:19.314
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, it's best.

01:27:28.625 --> 01:27:30.125
What the hell?

01:27:30.727 --> 01:27:32.327
And they're
gonna walk in here now.

01:27:33.396 --> 01:27:35.130
Oh, that's what the
"oh, no" is about?

01:27:35.665 --> 01:27:36.899
Good to know, huh.

01:27:45.541 --> 01:27:46.643
If these don't work...

01:27:49.378 --> 01:27:50.546
Where'd my stakes go?

01:27:50.947 --> 01:27:52.280
They're in the truck.

01:27:52.682 --> 01:27:53.783
But, Mrs. Rooney...

01:27:53.816 --> 01:27:55.652
Oh, don't be such a baby.

01:27:56.552 --> 01:28:01.289
I like my girls to fight for
that top seat in my team.

01:28:01.323 --> 01:28:04.326
Cut.

01:28:08.831 --> 01:28:10.667
- You all right?
- Yep.

01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:16.371
You know what, Alex,
I'm still pissed off.

01:28:17.239 --> 01:28:19.174
Dude!

01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:21.144
I just wanted to fit
in for the second time.

01:28:21.176 --> 01:28:24.414
Do you not remember when I stole
that 1966 Ford Mustang convertible,

01:28:24.447 --> 01:28:26.314
with just candy apple...
yeah, no, okay.

01:28:26.849 --> 01:28:28.418
Then you're
gonna take a piece.

01:28:28.951 --> 01:28:30.553
Can you demonstrate it for me?

01:28:31.353 --> 01:28:32.789
Can you demonstrate it for me?

01:28:35.323 --> 01:28:36.693
Gimme some sugar, baby.

01:28:38.027 --> 01:28:38.861
So.

01:28:45.868 --> 01:28:47.235
Gimme some sugar, baby.

01:28:49.739 --> 01:28:50.740
Honk...

01:28:56.813 --> 01:28:57.780
Would you excuse us?

01:28:57.947 --> 01:28:59.247
Sure.

01:28:59.281 --> 01:29:00.282
We're gonna get ready to go.

01:29:00.315 --> 01:29:02.985
- What?
- We're gonna go get ready...

01:29:03.019 --> 01:29:04.420
We're gonna go get ready.

01:29:04.454 --> 01:29:06.489
Why?

01:29:06.723 --> 01:29:07.990
You go get ready.

01:29:08.024 --> 01:29:09.459
Okay, yeah.

01:29:10.026 --> 01:29:11.461
Is that better, Aaron?

01:29:11.994 --> 01:29:12.995
Okay.

01:29:16.499 --> 01:29:17.500
Sorry.

01:29:18.901 --> 01:29:19.902
What do you mean?

01:29:20.503 --> 01:29:21.604
Take my hand.

01:29:34.316 --> 01:29:35.852
Are we about to kiss right now?

01:29:49.766 --> 01:29:50.767
Enough!

01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:55.505
Claire,
your cheek, that bruise.

01:29:55.538 --> 01:29:56.639
Claire?

01:29:56.672 --> 01:29:57.740
Did my name change?

01:29:59.075 --> 01:30:01.343
Sorry about that.
Sorry, that was my fault.

01:30:02.779 --> 01:30:04.013
You know, Chase.

01:30:06.549 --> 01:30:08.551
- What happened?
- I don't know!

01:30:08.584 --> 01:30:09.919
- I thought I was...
- She's been drinking.

01:30:09.952 --> 01:30:10.953
No, she's not.

01:30:11.687 --> 01:30:13.923
Tired Aaron is really funny.

01:30:16.058 --> 01:30:17.794
Cranky. Okay.

01:30:18.461 --> 01:30:20.029
Oh, dang flub it,
I forgot my first line.

01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:22.932
Okay.

01:30:22.965 --> 01:30:25.835
- Professional.
- Uh-uh. This is a big deal.

01:30:26.936 --> 01:30:28.037
Oh, hey, guys.

01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:30.406
Hey, Chase, are you a bowler?

01:30:30.439 --> 01:30:32.875
Because you're
right up my alley.

01:30:40.983 --> 01:30:41.984
Yeah.

01:30:43.252 --> 01:30:46.656
I was gonna, and I told myself
that, at the end of the year,

01:30:46.689 --> 01:30:47.690
I was gonna...

01:30:49.125 --> 01:30:50.693
- Sorry.
- The best year ever.

01:30:52.595 --> 01:30:54.564
Ever since then, weird things
have been happening to me

01:30:54.597 --> 01:30:57.800
and I think I just ate
Sean Patrick just now.

01:30:58.601 --> 01:31:00.603
No, I saved Sean Patrick.

01:31:02.138 --> 01:31:05.608
Movie's over,
I ate him!

01:31:07.743 --> 01:31:09.111
Was he yummy?

01:31:09.145 --> 01:31:11.447
Shut up!

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:13.115
Mm! Delightful!

01:31:13.583 --> 01:31:14.951
Okay, sorry.

01:31:52.521 --> 01:31:53.656
You're still here?

01:31:54.724 --> 01:31:58.761
<i>Teenage Vampire</i> is over,
go home.
