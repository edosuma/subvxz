How you folks doing?

25:47.937 --> 25:50.374
Okay. Not so good.

25:51.898 --> 25:53.247
Umm,

25:54.988 --> 25:56.598
wonder if...

25:56.642 --> 25:59.688
Wonder if you might be able to
help me out?

25:59.732 --> 26:00.994
I'm looking for a friend.

26:01.037 --> 26:05.738
She's about yay tall. And...

26:05.781 --> 26:09.045
she...

26:10.307 --> 26:16.618
has got blonde hair and...

26:41.251 --> 26:42.513
Thank you.

26:43.384 --> 26:44.777
Thanks for your help.

26:55.918 --> 26:59.008
Used to be a lot of people
working here.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.923
Keep your eyes open.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.969
Looks like they wandered off.

27:07.234 --> 27:08.322
That it?

27:08.714 --> 27:10.367
That's it.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.848
I hope it starts.

27:13.936 --> 27:17.157
I could hot wire
the space shuttle.

27:19.028 --> 27:21.030
All right, then do it quietly.

27:21.074 --> 27:23.554
We don't want to attract
any unwanted guests.

27:23.598 --> 27:24.251
Got it.

27:35.566 --> 27:38.352
You get it started.
I'll unhook the tiller.

27:38.395 --> 27:39.353
All right.

28:27.357 --> 28:28.489
Cooper!

28:58.258 --> 28:59.389
Climb up!

29:07.615 --> 29:09.138
Turn on the engine!

29:15.014 --> 29:15.754
Yeah!

30:01.451 --> 30:03.584
Warren!

30:13.507 --> 30:19.034
You're killing me!
You know what! You find me!

30:19.513 --> 30:21.863
I'll be right over here!

30:45.756 --> 30:47.846
Hey! Hey there!

30:49.108 --> 30:53.721
You! Did you see the...the woman
that crashed here?

30:53.764 --> 30:55.505
She's a friend of mine.
I'm looking for her.

30:56.767 --> 30:57.420
You did see her?

30:58.465 --> 30:59.988
You didn't see her?
Okay, listen.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.990
You need to focus up.
All right?

31:02.034 --> 31:05.733
Now, listen. Did you see
the woman that crashed in...

31:06.690 --> 31:07.517
Shit.

31:26.493 --> 31:30.801
So you did see her. Why didn't
you say so in the first place?

31:30.845 --> 31:32.803
Which way did she go?

31:38.070 --> 31:39.419
That way?

31:40.115 --> 31:41.377
Are you sure?

31:46.948 --> 31:47.949
Thanks, buddy.

32:01.528 --> 32:03.530
Do you smell that?

32:03.573 --> 32:06.576
Sweet fresh air.
Not a whiff of Apocalypse.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.056
We must be getting close.

32:08.100 --> 32:10.232
It's too cold up here
for the Zs.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.933
Are we there yet?

32:15.324 --> 32:16.935
A little further.

32:23.419 --> 32:24.333
Up there.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.466
I see it.

32:26.509 --> 32:27.815
Is that it?

32:27.858 --> 32:30.383
Smaller than I expected.

32:46.225 --> 32:49.619
Everybody stay put
till we check this out.

33:09.639 --> 33:11.293
Greetings, stranger.

33:11.337 --> 33:12.903
Peace, brother.

33:13.513 --> 33:16.733
So... Is this Newmerica?

33:17.299 --> 33:18.822
Not yet.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.650
What do you mean not yet?

33:20.694 --> 33:22.174
We ain't voted yet.

33:22.217 --> 33:23.523
Who's we?

33:23.566 --> 33:26.047
Anybody still alive and talking.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.093
Well what are you voting for?

33:28.136 --> 33:29.833
Our lives.

33:30.530 --> 33:32.532
Just got here, huh?

33:33.750 --> 33:36.405
Looks like you've been
on the road for a while.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.277
Whole damn Apocalypse.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.540
Brains!

33:57.426 --> 34:01.039
Looks like somebody didn't get
their bizkits.

34:01.343 --> 34:02.127
Bizkits?

34:07.828 --> 34:09.395
Hey man, don't hit him.

34:17.403 --> 34:19.057
That Talker went after Dale!

34:19.709 --> 34:23.844
Let go of me,
you zombie sons of bitches!

34:26.586 --> 34:27.848
Shh, shh, shh.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.287
Shh, shh, shh.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.076
Here you go.

34:42.341 --> 34:43.907
Shh.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.089
You can let her go now.

34:58.357 --> 34:59.401
Shh, shh, shh.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.577
It's all right.

35:08.802 --> 35:10.586
How long has she been dead?

35:10.630 --> 35:14.155
Dead? We just thought she
was sick. She's talking.

35:14.199 --> 35:16.897
No, she's dead.
So are those two.

35:18.725 --> 35:19.813
They're Talkers.

35:21.554 --> 35:22.685
Talkers?

35:22.729 --> 35:23.860
Since the Black Rain,

35:23.904 --> 35:26.515
people don't just die and turn
like before.

35:26.559 --> 35:30.171
Their bodies are dead, but
their souls remain conscious.

35:30.476 --> 35:32.173
The dead don't just walk.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.394
Now they talk.

37:19.324 --> 37:23.153
Is that your wife
and your daughter in there?

37:29.943 --> 37:32.162
Before the Black Rain,

37:33.729 --> 37:35.122
things got bad.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.564
My daughter Claudette got...

37:44.610 --> 37:46.481
She got sick.

37:47.308 --> 37:50.964
And my wife Sarah couldn't stand
to see her suffer.

37:51.617 --> 37:56.230
What I didn't know was how much
Sarah was suffering too.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.190
One day,

38:00.756 --> 38:03.672
while I was off
looking for medicine,

38:05.587 --> 38:08.895
Sarah put my daughter
in the car,

38:09.461 --> 38:11.854
drove it into the barn,

38:12.681 --> 38:14.683
and left the engine on.

38:18.383 --> 38:22.169
And that's where I found them
when I got home that day.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.869
Why...

38:27.957 --> 38:29.785
are they still in there?

38:32.310 --> 38:35.313
Why haven't you mercied them?

38:35.574 --> 38:39.142
Maybe I wanted to think
I'd find a cure.

38:39.186 --> 38:44.147
They were so beautiful
and conscious, I couldn't.

38:48.021 --> 38:49.544
I can't.

39:00.512 --> 39:04.037
Let me do this for you.

39:08.955 --> 39:11.131
Let me do it for them.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.703
Don't worry.
There's plenty for everyone.

40:02.704 --> 40:06.273
Oh, you probably don't want to
eat that unless you're dead.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.406
What's in it?

40:08.449 --> 40:11.887
Z Bizkits?
Nobody knows for sure.

40:11.931 --> 40:17.850
And nobody wants to know. Rumor
is it's trace amounts of brains.

40:17.893 --> 40:20.722
Keeps the Talkers happy...human.

40:20.766 --> 40:23.812
Without it, they eventually
turn into zombies.

40:24.247 --> 40:26.162
How's it taste, Granny?

40:26.467 --> 40:31.341
Kinda metallic.
Needs a little more sugar.

40:31.951 --> 40:33.779
That you?

40:36.999 --> 40:38.958
Everybody keeps saying that.

40:39.001 --> 40:40.438
I can see why.

40:42.135 --> 40:44.790
I'm George. This is my friend,
Lieutenant Dante.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.966
Lieutenant, huh

40:47.009 --> 40:50.796
I was, until I died.

40:52.188 --> 40:55.931
You know, we've traveled
a long way to find Newmerica.

40:55.975 --> 40:58.194
Tell me this ain't it.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.807
Newmerica doesn't exist.
At least, not yet.

41:01.850 --> 41:04.462
You know, right now Newmerica's
just an idea,

41:04.505 --> 41:07.290
a dozen outposts each trying
to make it on their own.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.858
But they can't, which is why
we're voting on a constitution

41:09.902 --> 41:11.077
to become a new nation.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.514
Do you have to be a citizen
to vote?

41:13.819 --> 41:15.951
Anybody can become a citizen.

41:15.995 --> 41:19.389
You don't even have to be alive.

41:20.216 --> 41:23.437
Well, sounds like a sweet deal.
Where do I sign up?

41:23.481 --> 41:26.788
Right up the road
is the biggest outpost, Altura.

41:26.832 --> 41:28.311
They're good friends of mine.

41:28.355 --> 41:31.358
I'll take you there
and we'll get you signed up.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.882
Anybody else want to be part of
something great?

41:33.926 --> 41:35.797
Yeah. You bet.

41:37.233 --> 41:41.281
I can vote,
even though I'm dead?

41:41.324 --> 41:42.587
All are welcome.

41:42.891 --> 41:46.416
United we live. Divided we turn.

41:47.722 --> 41:50.203
You are that woman
on the poster.

41:52.248 --> 41:55.208
Come on. I'll show you the way.

42:33.899 --> 42:37.946
Listen, Bob. I want to thank you
for your service.

42:38.468 --> 42:40.819
I think I got it from here.
