WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.142
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.242 --> 00:11.512
THANKS FOR SEEING ME.
I HAD NO ONE ELSE
TO TALK TO.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.215
- I THOUGHT MY HOUR WOULD
BE FILLED ALREADY.
- NO.

00:14.315 --> 00:17.151
- I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU CALLED.
- REALLY?

00:17.251 --> 00:20.488
LOSING A PATIENT
IS SUCH A BIG DEAL?

00:23.091 --> 00:24.792
LOSING YOU
WAS A BIG DEAL.

00:24.892 --> 00:28.429
- I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO KNOW.
- KNOW WHAT?

00:28.529 --> 00:31.599
THAT I HAVE VERY DEEP
FEELINGS FOR YOU.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.768
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
YOU'RE GOING AWAY
FOR A FEW DAYS?

00:34.868 --> 00:37.771
IT'S FOR A WEEK,
ACTUALLY.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.940
WITH HIM?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.509
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:42.710 --> 00:44.212
TO ROME.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.380
DADDY?

00:59.293 --> 01:01.762
( pen scratching )

01:20.948 --> 01:22.716
HEY.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.354
IAN'S BEING
AN ASSHOLE.

01:26.454 --> 01:27.788
WHAT?

01:28.989 --> 01:31.392
YOUR SON--
ASSHOLE.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.327
OH, COME ON, ROSIE.
HE'S HEADING BACK
TO SCHOOL

01:33.427 --> 01:35.629
IN-- WHAT? --TWO HOURS.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.567
DON'T YOU AT LEAST WANT
TO KNOW WHAT HE DID?

01:39.667 --> 01:43.204
CAN YOU TWO NOT GET ALONG
FOR JUST ONE LOUSY WEEKEND?

01:43.304 --> 01:44.638
IS THAT NOT POSSIBLE?

01:44.738 --> 01:46.774
HE WASHED MY iPOD.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.510
I HAD SOME CLOTHES
JUST SITTING ON TOP
OF THE MACHINE,

01:49.610 --> 01:52.613
HE JUST DUMPED THEM
IN WITH THE REST OF HIS
DISGUSTING SPORTS STUFF

01:52.713 --> 01:54.282
AND MY iPOD WAS
IN ONE OF MY POCKETS.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.384
- OH, JESUS.
- I KNOW.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.986
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
- I KNOW.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.355
YOUR BROTHER'S
ACTUALLY DOING LAUNDRY?

02:04.124 --> 02:06.627
( theme music playing )

02:22.576 --> 02:25.913
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT FUNNY.
HE DIDN'T EVEN OFFER
TO PAY ME BACK.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.482
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO? I CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT MY MUSIC.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.251
- MMM.
- ( cell phone beeps )

02:31.619 --> 02:34.522
- WHAT? WHO'S THAT?
- MMM.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.032
UM, HELLO?

02:45.132 --> 02:47.501
JUST--
JUST ONE SECOND.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.772
OKAY.
YOU WERE SAYING?

02:51.872 --> 02:54.408
YOU WHAT I LOVE?
THAT THERE'S NOTHING MORE
IMPORTANT IN YOUR LIFE

02:54.508 --> 02:57.144
THAT A TEXT MESSAGE
DOESN'T TAKE PRIORITY.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.380
I THINK THAT
MY GENERATION

02:59.480 --> 03:01.482
MIGHT HAVE A SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP

03:01.582 --> 03:03.083
WITH TECHNOLOGY
THAN YOURS DOES.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.052
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
READING A BOOK?

03:05.152 --> 03:07.655
OH, I'D ACTUALLY
RATHER DIE, BUT THANKS.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.458
COME ON, DAD.
GIVE ME A BREAK.
IT'S A NATIONAL HOLIDAY.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.294
OKAY.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.198
HOW CAN ANYBODY
TYPE SO FAST?

03:18.299 --> 03:20.701
I-- HERE, LET ME SEE.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.169
NO, DAD, NO.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.238
- I JUST WANT TO SEE IT.
- DAD, NO. IT'S PRIVATE.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.540
OKAY OKAY OKAY,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.448
WHAT'S "MUSM"?

03:36.317 --> 03:37.351
IT'S M-U-S-M.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.253
IT MEANS
"MISS YOU SO MUCH."

03:39.353 --> 03:41.188
OH. OKAY.

03:41.289 --> 03:44.525
SO WHO'S MISSING YOU
SO MUCH?

03:46.627 --> 03:49.763
I-- I THOUGHT WE WERE
HAVING A CONVERSATION.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.665
WE REALLY WEREN'T.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.568
SO WHO'S MISSING YOU
SO MUCH?

03:55.536 --> 03:58.171
RELAX, DAD.
JUST A FRIEND.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.907
BOYFRIEND?

04:00.007 --> 04:01.275
UH, A FRIEND
THAT'S A BOY.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.276
OH, OKAY.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.112
SO WHAT'S HIS NAME?

04:05.212 --> 04:07.515
UH, HE DOESN'T
HAVE A NAME.

04:07.615 --> 04:08.849
HE DOESN'T
HAVE A NAME?

04:08.949 --> 04:12.553
NOPE. NO, ACTUALLY
HE BELIEVES THAT NAMES

04:12.653 --> 04:15.589
ARE ANCHORS THAT
WEIGH DOWN THE SOUL.

04:15.689 --> 04:19.126
- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE KIDDING.
- I'M KIDDING.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.028
HIS NAME IS NOAH.

04:21.128 --> 04:23.497
- NOAH.
- NOAH.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.298
HUH.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.800
- FROM SCHOOL?
- NO.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.002
WHERE-- FROM WHERE?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.238
JUST FROM AROUND,
NOT FROM SCHOOL.

04:31.339 --> 04:34.074
OKAY, WE'RE PROGRESSING.
WHERE ELSE IS HE NOT FROM?

04:34.174 --> 04:38.245
- DOES IT REALLY MATTER?
- OH, COME ON. INDULGE ME,
ROSIE, PLEASE.

04:38.346 --> 04:41.649
I MET HIM AT THE CENTER,

04:41.749 --> 04:44.818
AND, DAD, HE'S THE MOST
AMAZING MUSICIAN.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.424
SO HE VOLUNTEERS
WITH YOU AT THE CENTER?

04:50.524 --> 04:53.293
NO, HE MET THERE
WITH SHELLY A COUPLE
OF TIMES.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.863
AND WHAT WAS HE BEING
TREATED FOR, TALENT?

04:57.097 --> 04:59.467
OKAY.
WHEN HE WAS 16

04:59.567 --> 05:02.102
HE HAD A FIGHT
WITH HIS STEPDAD.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.738
AH. SO...

05:04.838 --> 05:07.140
HOW OLD
IS HE NOW?

05:07.240 --> 05:08.976
HE'S 18.

05:09.076 --> 05:13.647
ANYWAY, HE THREW
A ROCK THROUGH ONE WINDOW
OF THIS GUY'S S.U.V.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.249
AND THE ASSHOLE
HAD HIM ARRESTED
TO TEACH HIM A LESSON.

05:16.350 --> 05:19.920
AND SO THE COURT
ORDERED HIM TO GO
TO ONE OF THE COUNSELORS.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.223
AND, DAD, HONESTLY,
SHELLY REALLY HELPED
HIM TO TURN IT AROUND.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.459
HE'S LIKE THE GENTLEST,
SWEETEST GUY

05:25.559 --> 05:29.363
AND HE WRITES THESE
AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL SONGS.

05:29.463 --> 05:32.099
HE JUST DIDN'T
KNOW HOW TO DEAL
WITH HIS FEELINGS BEFORE

05:32.199 --> 05:34.435
BUT NOW HE TURNS THEM
INTO LYRICS.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.270
HMM. 18.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.841
SO IS HE, UM--
IS HE ALL DONE
WITH SCHOOL?

05:42.275 --> 05:44.244
HE WORKS
AT KINKO'S, OKAY?

05:44.344 --> 05:45.713
I KNOW,
REALLY NOT GREAT,

05:45.813 --> 05:47.481
BUT I'M TRYING TO
GET HIM A NEW JOB.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.650
IN FACT, I SAW
THIS ENTRY-LEVEL JOB

05:49.750 --> 05:52.119
- IN THE CLASSIFIEDS TODAY.
- MMM.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.355
WHAT?

05:55.456 --> 05:57.224
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
REALLY GOOD AT THAT--

05:57.324 --> 05:59.593
TAKING PEOPLE
UNDER YOUR WING.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.662
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

06:01.762 --> 06:05.466
NOTHING. IT'S WHAT
I LOVE ABOUT YOU.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.136
SOMETIMES, THOUGH,

06:09.236 --> 06:11.505
YOU CAN HELP
THE MOST BY...

06:11.605 --> 06:14.141
ESTABLISHING BOUNDARIES.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.976
BOUNDARIES?

06:16.076 --> 06:19.079
WELL, HE MIGHT BE
IN MORE NEED

06:19.179 --> 06:21.048
OF A GOOD FRIEND
THAN SAY...

06:21.148 --> 06:23.951
( clears throat )
A GIRLFRIEND.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.821
OKAY.
I GET IT.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.957
YOU'RE WORRIED THAT
I'M SLEEPING WITH HIM.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.960
NO, I'M NOT WORRIED THAT
YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH HIM.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.930
SHOULD I BE?

06:38.432 --> 06:39.833
WORRIED?
SHOULD YOU BE WORRIED?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.035
- MM-HMM.
- NO, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE WORRIED.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.404
OKAY, FINE. OKAY.

06:46.474 --> 06:50.744
THE CAR WINDOW THING--
DOES HE HAVE A RECORD?

06:51.378 --> 06:53.481
DAD, REALLY...

06:53.581 --> 06:55.315
IT WAS YEARS AGO.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.552
TELL ME YOU NEVER
MADE A STUPID MISTAKE
WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.689
NO, I-- I JUST WANTED
TO BE CLEAR, THAT'S ALL.

07:01.789 --> 07:05.526
DID-- DID HE SERVE TIME
FOR THE CAR WINDOW THING?

07:05.626 --> 07:07.227
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE TO GO BECAUSE

07:07.327 --> 07:08.829
NOAH IS ROBBING
A BANK THIS MORNING

07:08.929 --> 07:11.298
AND I PROMISED HIM
I WOULD DRIVE THE
GETAWAY CAR,

07:11.398 --> 07:13.000
SO I'LL SEE YOU.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.969
- WAIT, ROSIE.
- NO, SERIOUSLY, DAD,
I'VE GOTTA GO.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.905
ROSIE, WAIT.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.541
PLEASE, ROSIE, LOOK.
ROSIE, I'M SORRY.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.510
I JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT
WHO THE BOY IS, THAT'S ALL.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.612
I DON'T THINK
YOU DO, DAD.

07:24.712 --> 07:27.881
YOU JUST WANT THE BASIC
FACTS-- THE WHO, THE WHAT
AND THE WHERE--

07:27.981 --> 07:30.017
LIKE THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
YOU ALWAYS DO THIS.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.452
YOU ALWAYS ASK
ALL THE WRONG QUESTIONS.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.823
OKAY OKAY.
SO TELL ME:

07:35.923 --> 07:38.726
WHAT QUESTIONS
SHOULD I BE ASKING?

07:41.061 --> 07:42.896
"IS HE NICE TO YOU?"

07:44.231 --> 07:47.034
YOU KNOW, "CAN YOU TALK
TO HIM ABOUT STUFF?"

07:47.134 --> 07:50.470
"DOES HE MAKE
YOU FEEL BETTER
ABOUT YOUR LIFE?"

07:50.571 --> 07:53.674
I WAS-- I WAS HOPING
WE'D GET AROUND TO THAT.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.544
WHAT, AFTER
THE INTERROGATION?

07:59.079 --> 08:02.082
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT STUFF, DAD,

08:02.182 --> 08:04.017
BUT NOT LIKE THIS.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.786
I MEAN, WHAT'S NEXT?

08:05.886 --> 08:07.921
OH, I KNOW:
THE PART WHERE YOU SAY

08:08.021 --> 08:10.724
YOU JUST DON'T WANT
ME DOING SOMETHING
I'M GOING TO REGRET LATER.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.526
I DON'T TALK
LIKE THAT, DO I?

08:12.626 --> 08:14.361
YOU MAKE ME SOUND
LIKE I'M SOME SORT OF--

08:14.461 --> 08:16.363
LIKE I'M A GRANDMOTHER
OR SOMETHING.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.998
WELL, YEAH, YOU DO.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.669
DO I?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.844
IF-- IT'S LIKE IF--

08:32.646 --> 08:35.415
IF YOU KNEW I WAS GONNA
DO SOMETHING REALLY STUPID

08:35.515 --> 08:37.250
WITH ANOTHER GUY--

08:37.350 --> 08:40.821
NOT NOAH, YOU KNOW,
SOME OTHER GUY,
SOME JERK...

08:40.921 --> 08:42.455
MM-HMM.

08:42.556 --> 08:46.560
...I MEAN, YOU WOULD
WANT TO STOP ME FROM
DOING IT. IS THAT IT?

08:46.660 --> 08:49.997
YEAH, I'D TRY TO HELP YOU
LOOK AT THE RISKS, YEAH.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.299
YEAH.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.737
YOU KNOW, IF--

08:56.837 --> 09:01.842
LIKE, IF I WAS GONNA
TAKE OFF WITH HIM...

09:04.578 --> 09:08.949
YOU KNOW, LIKE
TAKE OFF TO ROME.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.966
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ROME?

09:28.468 --> 09:30.904
( voice cracking )
I CALLED HER CELL PHONE.

09:31.004 --> 09:35.508
SHE PICKED UP,
AND I HEARD IN
THE BACKGROUND

09:35.609 --> 09:37.811
SOME GUY
SAY SOMETHING LIKE,

09:37.911 --> 09:40.648
"WHERE DO YOU WANT HIM
TO PUT THE TRAY, BABE?"

09:40.748 --> 09:43.684
THEN I HEARD
HER SHUSHING HIM,

09:43.784 --> 09:45.819
AND THEN HER VOICE
GOT ALL ECHOEY,

09:45.919 --> 09:48.989
LIKE SHE WENT
INTO THE BATHROOM
TO FINISH THE CONVERSATION.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.825
THAT WAS THAT.

09:55.896 --> 10:02.002
HE SOUNDED REALLY GROSS,
LIKE-- HE CALLED HER BABE.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.773
SO MUCH FOR "I JUST
NEED A LITTLE BREAK
FROM CARPOOLING," RIGHT?

10:07.641 --> 10:11.411
I MEAN, DAD, HERE YOU
ARE TRYING TO STOP ME
FROM MAKING A MISTAKE

10:11.511 --> 10:15.048
AND SHE IS
SLEEPING WITH SOMEONE
THAT ISN'T YOU.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.618
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY.
WHY IS SHE DOING THAT?

10:18.719 --> 10:20.788
LOOK, ROSIE, WE--

10:20.888 --> 10:23.991
WE ARE TRYING TO WORK
THIS OUT TOGETHER.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.126
DAD, SHE IS
SCREWING ANOTHER GUY.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.061
DID THIS JUST HAPPEN
OUT OF THE BLUE?

10:28.161 --> 10:29.562
ROSIE, LOOK.

10:29.663 --> 10:30.931
IT'S TAKEN
A REALLY LONG TIME

10:31.031 --> 10:32.933
FOR YOUR MOTHER AND ME
TO GET TO THIS POINT.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.169
WHAT YOUR MOTHER DID
OR DIDN'T DO ISN'T--

10:36.269 --> 10:39.506
WAIT. ARE YOU SAYING
WHAT SHE'S DOING
ISN'T WRONG?

10:39.606 --> 10:41.742
NO, WHAT I'M SAYING
IS THAT IT'S--

10:41.842 --> 10:43.543
IT'S A SYMPTOM

10:43.643 --> 10:46.346
- OF SOMETHING ELSE
THAT'S GOING ON.
- OKAY OKAY.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.981
WHATEVER IT IS,
CAN YOU FIX IT?

10:48.081 --> 10:51.151
ROSIE, I-- I AM TRYING
TO WORK ON IT.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.921
HOW HARD?
BECAUSE THIS WHOLE WEEKEND

10:54.021 --> 10:55.689
WITH IAN HOME,
IT'S LIKE, "DUM-DE-DUM.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.825
EVERYTHING IS FINE.
EVERYTHING IS NORMAL."

10:57.925 --> 10:59.492
IAN IS COMPLETELY
OBLIVIOUS.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.628
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO, BREAK
YOUR MOTHER'S CAR WINDOWS?

11:01.729 --> 11:05.432
DAD, IT WORKED.
HIS STEPDAD NEVER FUCKED
WITH HIM AGAIN THAT.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.768
WELL, IT'S-- IT'S...

11:10.237 --> 11:11.805
IT'S A BIT EXTREME,
DON'T YOU THINK?

11:11.905 --> 11:14.975
ANOTHER MAN IS TAKING
YOUR WIFE TO ROME.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.010
ISN'T THAT
PRETTY EXTREME?

11:23.784 --> 11:26.319
WHY IS SHE DOING
THIS TO US?

11:27.320 --> 11:29.189
ROSIE...

11:31.792 --> 11:36.029
JUST PLEASE TELL ME THAT
YOU WILL FIX IT, OKAY?

11:36.129 --> 11:39.299
PLEASE, TELL ME
YOU'LL FIX THIS.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.028
- HEY.
- HEY.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.330
YOU KNOW WHERE
THE GOOD DOWN PILLOW
ON MY BED WENT?

12:10.430 --> 12:14.067
I WANTED TO TAKE IT WITH ME,
AND MOM SAID YOU MIGHT
KNOW WHERE IT IS.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.304
I SOMETIMES NAP
DOWN HERE.

12:24.778 --> 12:27.080
SO, ARE YOU--

12:27.881 --> 12:29.749
ARE YOU ALL SET TO GO?

12:29.850 --> 12:32.419
UH, YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

12:35.022 --> 12:38.091
WOULD YOU MIND HANGING OUT
FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES

12:38.191 --> 12:41.094
UNTIL YOUR MOM
AND MAX GET BACK?

12:41.194 --> 12:43.496
SHE JUST CALLED ME FROM
THE SPORTING GOODS STORE.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.432
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

12:45.532 --> 12:49.169
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE
SO EXCITED ABOUT GETTING
TO WEAR A CUP.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.270
( chuckles )

12:50.370 --> 12:54.875
HE'D BE REALLY,
UH, HAPPY IF YOU, UH--

12:54.975 --> 12:56.643
IF YOU WENT TO SEE HIM
IN ONE OF HIS GAMES.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.312
IT'D MEAN A LOT TO HIM

12:59.412 --> 13:02.049
TO HAVE HIS BROTHER
COME DOWN AND WATCH
HIM PLAY,

13:02.149 --> 13:04.717
EVEN IF YOU HAD TO CUT
OUT OF SCHOOL ONE FRIDAY.

13:04.818 --> 13:07.821
YOU KNOW YOU SOUND
EXACTLY LIKE MOM, RIGHT?

13:07.921 --> 13:11.058
HOW DO YOU DO THAT, ANYWAY?
YOU GOT HER VOICE COMING OUT
OF YOUR BODY.

13:11.158 --> 13:14.694
IT'S LIKE--
WHAT YOU CALL IT?

13:14.794 --> 13:15.628
VENTRILOQUISM.

13:15.728 --> 13:18.631
YEAH. YEAH, THAT.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.068
SO WHY NO MORNING PATIENT?

13:21.168 --> 13:24.004
I THOUGHT EVERYONE'S ALWAYS
FIGHTING FOR THOSE EARLY SLOTS.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.574
UH, IT CHANGES, YOU KNOW.
THEY COME, THEY GO.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.710
I'VE HAD A FEW PATIENTS
THAT HAVE LEFT.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.680
REALLY? CURED?

13:33.780 --> 13:35.682
- WELL...
- CONGRATS.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.651
- IS THAT WEIRD?
- WHAT?

13:38.751 --> 13:41.788
YOU SPEND ALL THIS TIME
WITH PEOPLE HELPING THEM
DEAL WITH THEIR SHIT

13:41.889 --> 13:43.023
AND THEN THEY'RE GONE.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.025
IS IT LIKE ME GOING OFF
TO COLLEGE AGAIN?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.427
"GOODBYE, GOOD LUCK,
DON'T BE A STRANGER"?

13:47.527 --> 13:50.931
I THINK YOU'RE FORGETTING
I WAS THE ONE WHO ENCOURAGED
YOU TO GO TO COLLEGE.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.933
BECAUSE OF CHLOE.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.801
- NOT BECAUSE OF--
- NO, IT'S COOL.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.003
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT HER.

13:56.103 --> 13:59.772
WE WEREN'T MEANT
FOR EACH OTHER.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.075
I JUST--
I COULDN'T SEE IT.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.577
I DON'T REMEMBER
IT HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH--

14:04.677 --> 14:07.780
HEY, DAD, YOU KNOW...

14:07.881 --> 14:10.050
I DON'T KNOW
IF I EVEN LOVED HER.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.953
MAYBE I DID. I--

14:13.053 --> 14:16.056
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.324
I DON'T KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.092
DO YOU EVER TALK TO HER?

14:19.192 --> 14:22.329
SHE CALLED ONCE
AND LEFT A MESSAGE.
I LEFT HER A MESSAGE,

14:22.429 --> 14:23.396
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

14:23.496 --> 14:28.435
MMM. SO ARE YOU SEEING
ANYBODY AT THE MOMENT?

14:29.802 --> 14:31.671
NO.

14:31.771 --> 14:36.109
LOTS OF GIRLS RIGHT NOW.
IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING
FOR ME.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.579
I DON'T KNOW.
IF I'M HAVING
A MIDLIFE CRISIS AT 20,

14:39.679 --> 14:42.082
- DOES THAT MEAN I'M NOT
GOING TO LIVE PAST 40?
- (both chuckle )

14:42.182 --> 14:44.251
IT'S NOT A MIDLIFE CRISIS,
BELIEVE ME.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.086
YOU WOULD KNOW,
WOULDN'T YOU?

14:46.186 --> 14:47.988
YEAH.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.392
SO HOW MANY GIRLS
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

14:54.094 --> 14:55.095
COME ON, DAD.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.931
I JUST WANT A--
LIKE A--

14:58.031 --> 15:01.701
APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY?
I'M CURIOUS.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.604
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE, LIKE, UH...

15:04.704 --> 15:06.406
FOUR OR FIVE.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.041
FOUR OR FIVE. WOW.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.943
YOU SLEPT
WITH FIVE GIRLS?

15:11.311 --> 15:14.314
IS THAT JUST
COUNTING THIS YEAR?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.483
LOOK, FIVE IS
NOTHING, OKAY?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.251
HENRY, MY ROOMMATE,

15:18.351 --> 15:20.553
HE TOLD ME THAT
IF ANYONE ASKS

15:20.653 --> 15:22.289
TO JUST ROUND UP.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.856
APPARENTLY FIVE
IS TOTAL LOSERVILLE.

15:23.957 --> 15:26.960
REALLY? WOW.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.728
THE TRUTH IS
I GET BORED.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.965
THREE MONTHS,
YOU KNOW, THAT'S AS LONG
AS THEY EVER LAST.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.636
CHLOE WAS NINE MONTHS,

15:36.736 --> 15:38.905
BUT, I MEAN--

15:39.006 --> 15:41.874
WELL, THE LAST TWO
DIDN'T REALLY COUNT
'CAUSE SHE WAS AWAY

15:41.975 --> 15:42.909
AND I WAS AWAY.

15:43.010 --> 15:46.213
AND ANYWAY, I WAS--

15:46.313 --> 15:48.115
I WAS CHEATING
ON HER WITH MAGGIE.

15:48.215 --> 15:51.184
YOU REMEMBER MAGGIE,
RIGHT, THE VIOLIN PLAYER?

15:51.284 --> 15:53.186
YEAH.
YOU WERE CHEATING--

15:53.286 --> 15:55.522
YOU WERE CHEATING
ON CHLOE WITH MAGGIE?

15:58.691 --> 15:59.926
WHAT CAN I SAY, MAN?

16:00.027 --> 16:02.162
THERE WAS A LOT
OF BEER INVOLVED.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.171
HAVE YOU--

16:11.271 --> 16:13.640
HAVE YOU SPOKEN
TO ROSIE LATELY?

16:13.740 --> 16:14.707
ABOUT WHAT?

16:14.807 --> 16:17.744
UM...
( clears throat )

16:19.079 --> 16:20.913
I THINK THAT, UM...

16:21.014 --> 16:23.783
I THINK
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT--

16:23.883 --> 16:28.788
WELL, THERE'S--
THERE'S BEEN SOME STUFF
GOING ON BETWEEN--

16:28.888 --> 16:31.691
BETWEEN
YOUR MOTHER AND ME.

16:31.791 --> 16:35.195
I THOUGHT MAYBE--

16:35.295 --> 16:37.597
MAYBE ROSIE
HAD MENTIONED IT.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.532
WHAT KIND OF STUFF?

16:41.468 --> 16:44.437
I DON'T KNOW.
WE-- WE-- WE'VE...

16:45.305 --> 16:47.474
WE'VE BEEN
HAVING PROBLEMS.

16:47.574 --> 16:50.043
YOU GUYS ARE ALWAYS
HAVING PROBLEMS.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.245
REALLY?
YOU THINK SO?

16:52.345 --> 16:55.782
YEAH, WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

16:55.882 --> 16:57.884
WELL, THIS STUFF IS NEW,

16:57.984 --> 16:59.952
AND, UH...

17:00.053 --> 17:02.689
WELL, IT'S--
IT'S SOMETHING THAT

17:02.789 --> 17:05.725
WE REALLY HAVE TO WORK ON.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.564
WELL, IT SOUNDS BIG.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.933
YOU DIDN'T, LIKE, SLEEP
WITH SOMEONE ELSE, DID YOU?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.668
NO NO NO NO.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.172
DID MOM?

17:20.773 --> 17:22.575
LOOK, IAN, I...

17:24.043 --> 17:26.313
IS MOM HAVING
AN AFFAIR?

17:28.315 --> 17:30.950
NO, SHE'S NOT.
IT'S, UM--

17:31.050 --> 17:34.487
IT'S ME, ACTUALLY.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.090
I'VE, UM--

17:37.190 --> 17:39.392
I-- I-- MET SOMEBODY, AND--

17:39.492 --> 17:43.330
BUT WE'RE NOT
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.569
WOW.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.837
UM--

17:52.872 --> 17:54.107
DO I KNOW HER?

17:54.207 --> 17:56.509
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.715
IS SHE A PATIENT?

18:04.251 --> 18:06.253
NO, SHE'S NOT A PATIENT.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.258
WELL...

18:13.426 --> 18:16.963
ARE YOU HAPPY OR ARE YOU
MISERABLE ABOUT IT?

18:17.063 --> 18:18.331
I CAN'T TELL.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.500
I'M BOTH.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.036
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,
BUT THERE'S A PART
OF ME THAT--

18:24.137 --> 18:26.206
THAT WISHES I--

18:26.306 --> 18:28.975
I DIDN'T FEEL
THE WAY I DO,
AND THEN THERE'S--

18:29.075 --> 18:31.378
ARE YOU IN LOVE
WITH HER?

18:34.547 --> 18:35.515
I DON'T KNOW.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.849
I'M NOT SURE.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.589
SO...

18:43.923 --> 18:46.293
ARE YOU AND MOM
SPLITTING UP?

18:46.393 --> 18:50.297
WE'RE TRYING
TO WORK IT OUT
AT THE MOMENT.

18:58.538 --> 19:02.675
WELL, MAYBE IT'S
FOR THE BEST.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.777
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
MARRIED A LONG TIME.
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED LONGER

19:04.877 --> 19:07.314
THAN I'VE BEEN ALIVE.
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.951
I'D SAY YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO HAVE SOME FUN.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.520
DIDN'T I SAY
THAT TO YOU?

19:15.355 --> 19:18.491
- WHEN?
- WHEN YOU FIRST
WENT TO SCHOOL.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.561
ABOUT CHLOE, I SAID,
"YOU'RE 18 YEARS OF AGE

19:21.661 --> 19:24.664
AND YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO HAVE SOME FUN."
REMEMBER THAT?

19:24.764 --> 19:28.201
SO WHAT? I TOLD YOU
YOU WERE PROBABLY
RIGHT ABOUT IT.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.470
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR OWN ADVICE?

19:30.570 --> 19:33.440
BUT THAT'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT SITUATION.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.409
YOU WERE JUST A KID.
I'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

19:36.509 --> 19:40.547
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT, REALLY.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.549
ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, DAD?

19:42.649 --> 19:44.584
"I THINK YOU'RE A TOTAL
ASSHOLE SHITHEAD?"

19:44.684 --> 19:46.786
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SAY I'M A TOTAL ASSHOLE
AND A SHITHEAD,

19:46.886 --> 19:49.422
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.793
WHATEVER, DAD.
THIS IS STUPID.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.529
LOOK, IAN, YOU KNOW--

19:57.697 --> 20:00.333
I KNOW WHEN
MY PARENTS SPLIT UP, I--

20:00.433 --> 20:02.201
I HAD TO STRUGGLE
FOR A LONG TIME.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.437
IN SOME WAYS I'M NOT
EVEN SURE THAT I EVER--

20:04.537 --> 20:06.205
WELL, I'M NOT YOU, DAD.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.241
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO SAY?

20:08.341 --> 20:10.310
"PLEASE DON'T LEAVE"?

20:10.410 --> 20:11.811
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO OUR FAMILY?"

20:11.911 --> 20:13.413
I MEAN--

20:13.513 --> 20:15.748
OR MAYBE YOU JUST--
YOU WANT ME TO STOP YOU?

20:15.848 --> 20:19.686
LOOK, I GET IT, OKAY?
I GET WHY YOU WOULD WANT
TO BE WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.154
I CAN UNDERSTAND
HOW AFTER 23 YEARS
OF MARRIAGE

20:22.255 --> 20:23.556
YOU COULD GET TIRED
OF STUFF--

20:23.656 --> 20:26.826
ALL THE NAGGING
AND ALL THOSE LONG-SUFFERING-

20:26.926 --> 20:30.229
SILENT-BUT-DEADLY LOOKS
THAT SHE GIVES YOU WHEN
YOU LET HER DOWN.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.699
I MEAN, SHE DOES IT
TO ROSIE, TO ME--

20:32.799 --> 20:35.201
EVERYTHING FROM SOME TONE
YOU'RE USING IN YOUR VOICE

20:35.302 --> 20:36.603
TO LEAVING A WET TOWEL
ON THE BED--

20:36.703 --> 20:39.105
THEY'RE ISSUES
THAT YOU HAVE WITH HER.

20:39.205 --> 20:41.374
THEY'RE NOT
NECESSARILY MINE.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.109
YOU THINK IT'S
SO DIFFERENT WITH YOU?

20:43.209 --> 20:48.147
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE SHE'S
ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED
OR SOMETHING?

20:48.247 --> 20:50.149
I MEAN, THE WOMAN
HAS GOT A MARTYR COMPLEX.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.884
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU CAN DEAL WITH IT.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.553
UH--

20:53.653 --> 20:55.054
MARTYR?

20:55.154 --> 20:59.258
THAT WOMAN PUT
HER CAREER ON HOLD
FOR 15 YEARS FOR YOU.

20:59.359 --> 21:02.895
SHE TOOK YOU TO BASEBALL GAMES.
SHE TOOK YOU TO GUITAR LESSONS.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.632
SHE WAS ALWAYS
THERE FOR YOU.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.000
I THINK SHE'S ENTITLED
TO SOME KIND OF GRATITUDE

21:08.100 --> 21:09.702
ALONG THE LINE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

21:11.904 --> 21:13.806
I KNOW.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.444
I DIDN'T MEAN TO...

21:19.011 --> 21:20.913
JUST-- WHATEVER.

21:21.013 --> 21:24.016
DON'T SAY THAT WORD TO ME.
"WHATEVER." GOD, I HATE
THAT WORD. "WHATEVER."

21:24.116 --> 21:25.284
IT'S SUCH A COP-OUT.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.819
LOOK, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

21:26.919 --> 21:29.389
I WANT YOU TO HAVE A LITTLE
RESPECT FOR YOUR MOTHER,

21:29.489 --> 21:31.290
THAT'S ALL.
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

21:31.391 --> 21:35.094
I DO, BUT IS IT
SO IMPOSSIBLE THAT I COULD
BE GENUINELY ON YOUR SIDE?

21:35.194 --> 21:37.296
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TAKE SIDES, IAN.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.732
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO TAKE SIDES.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.206
MAYBE IT WASN'T FAIR
OF ME TO--

21:47.306 --> 21:49.008
I KNOW THIS IS A LOT
FOR YOU TO DEAL WITH--

21:49.108 --> 21:50.377
THAT'S A COP-OUT, OKAY?

21:50.477 --> 21:51.978
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT
BOTH WAYS, DAD.

21:52.078 --> 21:55.181
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO TELL,
BUT I'M TOO YOUNG
TO UNDERSTAND IT?

21:55.281 --> 21:56.416
DON'T PATRONIZE ME.

21:56.516 --> 22:00.319
I DON'T MEAN TO
PATRONIZE YOU.
I DON'T.

22:00.420 --> 22:04.724
YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TAKES
A LONG TIME TO PROCESS.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.159
I KNOW YOU HAVE
THESE FEELINGS.
I JUST WANT US TO

22:07.259 --> 22:10.329
BE ABLE TO--
TO TALK ABOUT
THEM, YOU KNOW?

22:12.599 --> 22:14.333
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.803
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT I FEEL
OR WHY I FEEL IT.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.104
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

22:18.204 --> 22:20.840
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

22:20.940 --> 22:22.542
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:31.150 --> 22:33.085
( door opens, closes )

22:39.325 --> 22:41.961
( soft piano music
playing )
