00:36.411 --> 00:38.288
First of all,
let me get something straight.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.415
This is a journal, not a diary.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.544
When Mom went out to buy this thing,

00:44.627 --> 00:47.922
I specifically told her not to get a book
that said "Diary" on it.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.549
But, of course, she didn't listen.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.012
It's been hard enough getting through
the first week of middle school

00:54.095 --> 00:56.306
without carrying this thing
around with me.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.768
Hey, this kid's got a diary.

01:01.978 --> 01:03.396
A-Actually, it's a jour--

01:09.027 --> 01:11.738
If Mom's expecting me to write down
my feelings or whatever,

01:11.821 --> 01:13.490
she's gonna be disappointed.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.744
The only reason I agreed
to write in this thing at all

01:17.827 --> 01:20.038
is because one day
I'm gonna be rich and famous.

01:20.121 --> 01:23.083
And people'll wanna read about my
early years. So I'm doing this for them.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.959
-Greg is so smart.
-So handsome.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.712
-So brave.
-And he smells terrific.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.299
But for now, I'm stuck in middle school…

01:32.467 --> 01:33.677
…surrounded by morons.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.015
But luckily, I'm not alone
in this middle school thing.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.102
My best friend, Rowley,
is in the same grade as me.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.813
I doubt he's ever gonna be
rich and famous,

01:44.896 --> 01:46.815
but it's good to have him around
for laughs.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.943
Did you know
if your hand is bigger than your face,

01:50.026 --> 01:51.945
it's a sign that your brain is shrinking?

01:52.028 --> 01:53.029
It is?

01:54.197 --> 01:55.990
Gotcha.

01:56.074 --> 01:59.244
But does this mean my brain is shrinking?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.371
Not sure.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.872
Let's check the other hand.

02:03.998 --> 02:05.792
I'm glad Rowley's along for the ride,

02:05.875 --> 02:08.128
because everything else
about middle school stinks.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.380
And I can't believe it was just a week ago

02:10.463 --> 02:12.716
that me and Rowley were actually
looking forward to this.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.300
Heads up!

02:21.766 --> 02:25.228
That was a good one.
You almost hit the front tire that time.

02:25.311 --> 02:28.732
You just need to slow down a little
so I can get locked in.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.235
-Let me get this straight.
-Come on, Rowley.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.154
So in middle school,

02:34.237 --> 02:36.489
do you just go to a different room
for each class?

02:36.573 --> 02:37.782
Come on. You got it.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.535
And you just carry all your stuff
around with you all day?

02:40.618 --> 02:42.495
No, no. No, no, no.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.872
They give you a locker

02:43.955 --> 02:47.250
so you can just ditch the books you
don't need in between periods.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.877
W-w-what about recess?

02:50.253 --> 02:52.172
There's still recess, right?

02:52.255 --> 02:54.549
I told you, like, a million times, Rowley.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.718
Recess is an elementary school thing.

02:56.801 --> 02:59.471
Aw. But I like recess.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.599
Are you gonna go,
or are you just gonna sit there?

03:02.682 --> 03:05.560
Don't you want a turn riding?
I've gone three times in a row.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.815
But you're way better at riding than me.
I can never do it as good as you.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.362
Woo-hoo!

03:19.449 --> 03:20.658
-

03:26.623 --> 03:29.709
Oh, come on, Rodrick! You made me miss!

03:29.793 --> 03:31.252
I'm okay.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.845
One of the reasons
I'm friends with Rowley is

03:40.929 --> 03:43.640
there aren't a whole lot of boys my age
in the neighborhood.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.685
In fact, aside from Rowley,
there's only really--

03:46.768 --> 03:48.228
Fregley!

03:48.311 --> 03:50.563
Why, hello, Greg Heffley.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.943
Hi, Fregley. I was just, um,
getting-- getting my football.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.570
Wanna come inside my house for a playdate?

03:58.071 --> 04:00.615
I can show you my room.

04:00.699 --> 04:04.327
You know, I'll definitely take you up
on that offer sometime.

04:05.912 --> 04:06.913
Wanna see my…

04:08.415 --> 04:09.874
secret freckle?

04:13.795 --> 04:15.130
-

04:19.718 --> 04:21.928
Should we do that one over?

04:25.181 --> 04:26.349
Who's hungry?

04:37.485 --> 04:40.030
So, did everyone have a good day?

04:40.113 --> 04:42.824
Frank, don't do that with your food.
It's weird.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.452
-It tastes better this way.
-

04:45.535 --> 04:48.038
Hey! Oh!

04:48.121 --> 04:49.497
I'm still gonna eat it.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.293
Greg, is that dirt
on your back-to-school clothes?

04:53.376 --> 04:54.961
Please don't call them that.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.339
What on earth were you doing
to get so filthy?

04:57.422 --> 04:59.591
I was throwing a football in the street
with Rowley.

05:00.342 --> 05:06.139
You were playing a sport with
your feet and hands and not a device.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.265
Wo-- Wow.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.017
I guess.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.103
Mark the calendar, Susan.
Greg here played a sport.

05:12.187 --> 05:15.231
You weren't playing that game
with Rowley, were you?

05:15.315 --> 05:17.359
You know you're banned from playing that.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.652
Somebody is going to get hurt.

05:19.736 --> 05:20.737
What?

05:20.820 --> 05:22.364
Oh! Oh, that game?

05:22.447 --> 05:23.782
No. No way.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.658
You said we couldn't play that anymore.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.703
Right. And Rowley's parents
are in full agreement.

05:28.787 --> 05:29.871
Mm-hmm.

05:29.954 --> 05:32.040
Okay, there. All clean.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.130
Speaking of Rowley,
how's he feeling about Monday?

05:39.214 --> 05:41.633
Is he looking forward
to his first day of middle school?

05:41.716 --> 05:42.926
Hmm. I'm not sure.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.470
I think he might be
a little nervous, actually.

05:45.553 --> 05:49.557
Well, he's lucky to have you
as a best friend.

05:49.641 --> 05:52.727
You know, that's all you need to get by
in this world.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.562
One good friend.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.314
Yeah.

05:56.398 --> 05:59.734
And you're lucky to have a big brother

05:59.818 --> 06:03.113
who's already gone through
the middle school experience.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.197
Right, Rodrick?

06:06.408 --> 06:08.118
-Rodrick!
-Huh?

06:08.201 --> 06:11.413
Take off your headphones.
You know the rule.

06:11.496 --> 06:15.125
Why don't you give Greg a pep talk
about middle school?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.419
Greg's going to middle school?

06:17.502 --> 06:18.837
Yes, Rodrick.

06:18.920 --> 06:23.341
Why don't you tell him
what he can expect on his first day?

06:24.592 --> 06:27.679
Here's what you need to know.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.892
First of all, watch where you sit
on the first day of school,

06:32.976 --> 06:35.520
because your teacher might make that
your permanent seat.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.275
Next, don't use the bathroom
on the second floor,

06:40.358 --> 06:42.444
no matter how bad you have to go.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.488
-There aren't any doors on those stalls.
-

06:45.572 --> 06:49.117
And finally, whatever you do,

06:49.200 --> 06:52.287
don't get the Cheese Touch.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.457
'Cause if you do,
you might as well be dead.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.002
Thank you, Rodrick,

06:59.085 --> 07:01.171
-for that wonderful pep talk.
-

07:01.254 --> 07:04.257
Greg, please forget
everything that you just heard.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.551
Especially the nonsense about the cheese.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.346
But wha-- what's the Cheese Touch?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.974
It all started
in my first year of middle school.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.893
No one knows where it came from

07:14.976 --> 07:16.561
-or who put it there.
- Don't do it!

07:16.644 --> 07:17.937
One day…
- Stay away!

07:18.021 --> 07:20.523
…a slice of Swiss cheese
appeared on the blacktop.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.608
Ew!

07:21.691 --> 07:22.692
At first,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.235
-no one would go near it.
-Ugh!

07:24.319 --> 07:25.904
And then one day…
-Hmm.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.531
…a kid named Darren Walsh got curious.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.824
No way!
-

07:29.908 --> 07:32.786
And that's what started
the Cheese Touch.

07:33.787 --> 07:38.291
The only way to get rid of the Cheese
Touch is to give it to someone else.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.878
Then one day…
-

07:41.961 --> 07:44.172
…a kid named Abe Hall moved to California.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.424
He took the Cheese Touch with him.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.635
But the cheese remained.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.471
And to this day, it sits on the blacktop,

07:51.554 --> 07:54.516
waiting to strike again!

07:54.599 --> 07:56.393
Well, that's terrifying.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.853
Don't let Rodrick scare you, Greg.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.939
Middle school's gonna be fun.

08:01.022 --> 08:05.402
Oh, and please don't mention
the-- the cheese thing to Rowley.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.363
Honestly,
it-- it'll scare him half to death.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.323
Who's Rowley?

08:10.407 --> 08:11.408
Greg's best friend.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.494
You know, the kid who's over here
almost every single day.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.829
Oh, him.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.039
I thought you were babysitting that kid.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.874
We're the same age.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.793
He's the same age as y--

08:23.712 --> 08:27.674
Oh, man. I thought he was, like,
in kindergarten or something.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.052
Middle school's gonna eat him alive.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.137
Rodrick.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.057
Let me give you
one last piece of advice, Greg.

08:36.141 --> 08:38.768
Middle school is every man for himself.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.688
You don't need some overgrown baby
weighing you down.

08:41.771 --> 08:42.856
Rodrick!

08:42.939 --> 08:44.274
That's enough.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.739
Greg, come on, man. Trust me.

08:50.822 --> 08:53.616
Cut him loose now or you both drown.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.443
-You lose!
- Woo-hoo!

09:28.526 --> 09:31.654
In your face, Greg! That's three in a row.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.406
Wanna go again?

09:33.490 --> 09:35.283
No, that's okay. We can shut it off.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.576
What's the matter?

09:36.659 --> 09:39.371
Afraid to lose?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.706
No, I'm just not in the mood.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.175
Rowley, cut it out!

09:53.551 --> 09:54.636
I mean--

09:55.261 --> 09:57.514
Don't you think
it's time to start acting our age?

09:58.181 --> 10:00.350
But you always do the chicken thing to me.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.811
It's not just that, Rowley.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.062
Look around this room.

10:04.145 --> 10:08.775
All these stuffed animals, that bedspread,
and what's with this Joshie guy anyway?

10:08.858 --> 10:10.610
Joshie's from Europe.

10:10.694 --> 10:14.364
And you're just jealous
because I discovered him first.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.701
Yeah, I'm jealous that you discovered
some stupid pop star

10:17.784 --> 10:19.786
whose fans are only six-year-old girls.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.079
Joshie says,

10:21.162 --> 10:23.832
"Follow your dreams
and respect your parents."

10:24.624 --> 10:26.751
Don't you think
it's time to grow up, Rowley?

10:26.835 --> 10:28.211
You're in middle school now.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.671
Well, not yet.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.465
"Be friendly to one another, yes?"

10:32.549 --> 10:33.967
Come on, Rowley.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.635
Middle school's no joke.

10:35.719 --> 10:40.140
There's bullies, and bathrooms with
no stall doors, and permanent seats,

10:40.223 --> 10:42.183
-and-- and--
-And what?

10:42.267 --> 10:44.436
And the cheese!

10:44.519 --> 10:45.937
What's the cheese?

10:50.817 --> 10:53.361
Please don't mention the cheese thing.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.863
It'll scare him half to death.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.282
You know what?

10:57.365 --> 10:58.825
Forget I said anything.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.871
Middle school's gonna be just fine.
In fact, it'll be great.

11:03.705 --> 11:07.709
Yeah, 'cause we're in it together.
Right, Greg? Friends till the end.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.503
Yeah, friends till the end.

11:20.055 --> 11:23.141
Hi, how was your summer?
- My summer was awesome.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.852
No, I hate camp.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.688
Oh, my gosh, I love your backpack.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.648
Did your mom
dress you this morning?

11:30.732 --> 11:32.275
Look at those high waters.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.862
I heard that Peter Mud and Alicia
Tango got their braces stuck together

11:35.945 --> 11:38.114
-over the summer.
-Move to the side, shrimp.

11:38.990 --> 11:42.786
-Come on. Let's go. I don't wanna be late.
-But what about the-- the cheese?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.038
That's just some stupid fairy tale
Rodrick made up.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.083
Stop trying to copy my style, please.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.629
Nice mom jeans, Kelsey.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.547
Hair color…

11:54.631 --> 11:57.258
You know,
maybe this isn't such a good idea.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.219
Maybe my mom can homeschool me.

11:59.302 --> 12:00.512
-Come on, Rowley.
-

12:00.595 --> 12:02.180
You can do this.

12:02.263 --> 12:06.393
We can do this. We just need
to find our lockers and we'll be fine.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.727
Heads up.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.145
- Whoa!

12:10.772 --> 12:11.773
Ugh!

12:12.482 --> 12:14.776
But I gotta go to the bathroom!
-

12:15.652 --> 12:16.653
Ugh!

12:24.244 --> 12:25.704
-

12:25.787 --> 12:29.082
…sanitary.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.792
Yep. Homeschool for sure.

12:30.875 --> 12:31.876
One step at a time.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.546
Don't make eye contact,
and they won't even notice you're here.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.673
You better not be looking
at my boyfriend, Kelsey.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.883
-

12:38.967 --> 12:41.219
Come on. I was eating that.

12:43.805 --> 12:44.973
-

12:45.056 --> 12:46.474
Help me.

12:49.644 --> 12:50.979
Mm-mmm.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.356
That was close.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.569
Kindergarten's
down the street.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.196
Not so bad.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.365
And look.
Our lockers are right next to each other.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.242
Yes!

13:05.493 --> 13:07.412
Look. They keep our schedules in here.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.830
Cool. Let me see yours.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.791
But they don't match.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.669
Well, we've got lunch together.
We'll see each other then.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.672
Oh, hey!
- See ya!

13:17.756 --> 13:18.965
What do we do now?

13:19.674 --> 13:20.759
We go to homeroom.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.719
Mine's right here.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.305
Yours is upstairs, I think.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.557
-There's an upstairs?
-

13:28.391 --> 13:30.560
-Out of the way, runt.
-Move to the side, shrimp.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.604
-Step aside, little man.
-Yes, not for long, little man.

13:32.687 --> 13:36.649
Greg! What do I do? What do I do?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.860
There was no time
to worry about Rowley,

13:38.943 --> 13:41.321
because I needed to focus
on my own situation.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.800
I was glad Rodrick gave me
a few pointers, so I knew what not to do.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.765
Oh, hey.
- Yeah. Awesome.

14:11.726 --> 14:12.811
Uh…

14:15.814 --> 14:17.273
-

14:21.319 --> 14:22.320
Exactly!

14:23.905 --> 14:25.073
But it turns out…
- Shh.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.325
…having an older brother
who went to the same school

14:27.409 --> 14:29.577
isn't such a good thing after all.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.538
-Greg Heffley?
-Huh?

14:31.621 --> 14:34.040
-As in Rodrick Heffley's brother?
-

14:34.708 --> 14:37.460
You'll be sitting
in the chair in front of my desk.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.505
-

14:42.257 --> 14:44.801
Oh!

14:44.884 --> 14:46.761
Bro, dude's with the weirdo.
-

14:46.845 --> 14:49.806
Just about everything's different
from elementary school.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.227
Wouldn't want to be him.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.979
Mm-hmm.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.691
And the biggest change
is who's popular and who's not.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.735
-Back in elementary school, it was simple.
-

15:01.818 --> 15:04.279
If you were the fastest runner,
you were the most popular.

15:04.362 --> 15:05.405
-In fifth grade…
-

15:05.488 --> 15:07.282
…the fastest runner was Ronnie McCoy.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.200
But now, all the rules have changed.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.662
Now it's all about whether or not
you have cool hair

15:12.746 --> 15:14.914
and how many followers
you have on social media.

15:15.749 --> 15:16.750
In middle school,

15:16.833 --> 15:19.586
a kid like George Deveney
is at the top of the food chain,

15:19.669 --> 15:23.298
and Ronnie McCoy is scratching his head
wondering what the heck happened.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.634
So what I'm trying to figure out
is where I fit into all this.

15:26.718 --> 15:30.680
I'm sure I'm not at the top of the ladder,
but at least I'm not at the bottom.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.516
Does this scab smell funny to you?

15:34.351 --> 15:36.436
But there's one way for sure
to get to the bottom.

15:36.519 --> 15:37.520
Come on!

15:37.604 --> 15:40.023
Run! Yeah!
-Yo, get in there for the rebound, dude.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.776
And nobody's risking that.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.071
-

15:47.447 --> 15:49.699
What are you standing around for?

15:49.783 --> 15:51.117
Get the ball!

15:51.701 --> 15:53.119
Ew. It's so gross.
-

15:56.915 --> 16:00.669
Hey, what did you get for lunch?
- Today I have a jacket.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.837
Looks pretty full up.

16:03.880 --> 16:04.881
Oh, hey.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.927
Try your luck with someone else.
Maybe try the table next door.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.012
-Eighth-graders only, newbies.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.639
Should we sit with the girls?

16:12.722 --> 16:14.516
We're out of our league here.

16:14.599 --> 16:15.600
Hey! Over there.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.395
-Take a hike.
-Hey.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.814
Band members only.
- Not today, guys.

16:21.564 --> 16:22.816
Over there. Let's go!

16:22.899 --> 16:24.984
Yeah?
Check back when we're not so busy.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.323
Uh…

16:31.449 --> 16:33.451
There's two!

16:34.661 --> 16:36.621
-

16:36.705 --> 16:38.164
And another thing.

16:38.248 --> 16:41.042
Don't use the bathroom
on the second floor.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.670
That was a big mistake.

16:43.753 --> 16:46.506
Yeah, I probably
should have warned you about that.

16:49.384 --> 16:52.429
I can't deal with this.
I need to be sitting at a table.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.348
But you said only popular kids
get seats at the table.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.476
Well, I heard Charlie Davies
is getting braces next week,

16:58.560 --> 17:00.395
so he'll definitely
drop a few spots for sure.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.981
But that's only one spot. We need two.

17:05.525 --> 17:09.654
That's all the time we get?
I didn't even get to finish my juice box.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.906
We gotta go to fifth period, Rowley.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.325
I'll meet you back here
at the door after school.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.703
But I don't want to go back out there.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.122
Keep a low profile and you'll be fine.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.876
Think good thoughts, Rowley.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.755
Good thoughts, Rowley. Good thoughts.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.882
Hey, Greg!

17:28.965 --> 17:32.260
After school, wanna come over and play?

17:32.344 --> 17:35.513
Play, play, play, play, play…

17:43.688 --> 17:45.106
Play.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.608
Play.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.943
-Play.
- Play.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.784
-

18:04.084 --> 18:07.295
-Hey, kid. Wanna come over and play?
-Huh?

18:07.379 --> 18:09.255
Um, no, thank you.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.507
Psst! Rowley!

18:10.590 --> 18:14.135
There you are! You said we were gonna
meet at the back door.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.845
"Hang out," Rowley.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.765
You say "hang out" in middle school,
not "play."

18:18.848 --> 18:20.642
I've told you that a million times.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.561
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.855
Seriously,
you gotta start listening to me, Rowley.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.524
You're gonna get us both killed.

18:28.108 --> 18:32.779
So, do you wanna hang out
and "do" video games?

18:32.862 --> 18:33.863
Better.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.993
Thankfully,
Rowley did start listening to me.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.246
We made it through
the next few weeks alive.

18:42.372 --> 18:45.834
But by the time Halloween rolled around,
Rowley started to slip again.

18:46.918 --> 18:49.921
Do you think our teachers will let us
wear our costumes to school tomorrow?

18:50.005 --> 18:53.800
No, Rowley. No!
Have I not taught you anything?

18:53.883 --> 18:56.302
They had a costume parade
in elementary school.

18:56.386 --> 19:00.056
Right, elementary school.
We're in middle school now, remember?

19:00.765 --> 19:02.600
Yeah, you keep reminding me.

19:02.684 --> 19:05.145
Listen. The only reason
I'm trick-or-treating this year

19:05.228 --> 19:06.271
is for the candy.

19:06.354 --> 19:09.232
And I really don't want anyone
knowing we're doing this, okay?

19:09.315 --> 19:12.444
-I guess.
-Listen, things are hard enough at school.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.988
I just don't wanna put a target
on our backs, you know?

19:15.697 --> 19:16.740
Fine.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.325
So wear something
that doesn't attract too much attention.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.953
-Seriously, we have to be invisible.
-Got it.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.425
Ooh!
Is that our first trick-or-treater?

19:35.508 --> 19:37.594
-Can someone get the door?
-I'm on it.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.188
What? Huh?

19:51.316 --> 19:55.487
Rowley, what are you doing?
I thought we said we were being invisible?

19:55.570 --> 19:58.531
-My mom made me add safety stuff.
-We can deal with costume stuff later.

19:58.615 --> 19:59.616
Bubby.
- Greg?

19:59.699 --> 20:00.909
Let's get out of here before--

20:00.992 --> 20:03.078
You weren't gonna leave without Manny,
were you?

20:03.161 --> 20:06.331
-Rowley, you look adorable.
-Come on.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.917
-Mom, can't someone else take Manny?

20:09.000 --> 20:13.129
Well, Rodrick's at the high school party,
I'm going to be handing out the candy,

20:13.213 --> 20:17.676
and Dad is doing that thing
that he does on Halloween.

20:17.759 --> 20:20.887
Okay. Man your stations.
Well, I'll man mine.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.140
Just making sure we're not getting
toilet-papered this year.

20:24.683 --> 20:27.185
It takes too long to get that off.
No, no. It's not happening.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.604
Good thoughts. All positivity.

20:29.688 --> 20:31.564
But Manny will just slow us down.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.900
We're trying to double our territory
this year, Mom.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.569
Well, there are only so many houses
in our neighborhood.

20:36.653 --> 20:37.821
Wait a minute.

20:37.904 --> 20:41.324
You're not planning to take the shortcut
through Snake Road, are you?

20:41.408 --> 20:42.951
-What? No.
-

20:45.078 --> 20:46.746
That-- That would be crazy.

20:46.830 --> 20:51.084
Good. Because you would be in big trouble
if you did.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.962
-Right, Manny?
-

20:55.630 --> 20:58.091
Keep to the sidewalks,
and I want you back at 8:00.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.259
It's a school night.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.219
8:00? 8:00 a.m.?

21:01.302 --> 21:03.638
All right. I-- I mean, I'm fine with that.

21:03.722 --> 21:05.140
-

21:05.223 --> 21:08.143
Fine. 8:30 and not a second later.

21:08.226 --> 21:11.104
Oh, Rowley, you know what?
Those glow sticks are a great idea.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.940
Let me see if I have any in the pantry.

21:14.024 --> 21:15.275
Okay, time to go.

21:15.358 --> 21:17.444
-Come on, Manny. You wanna get some candy?
-

21:17.527 --> 21:18.820
Arr!

21:19.654 --> 21:21.865
Thank you.
- Isn't he in your class?

21:22.365 --> 21:25.076
That's a kiddy costume!
-All right! Let's go!

21:25.160 --> 21:26.828
It's the Prince of Preschool.

21:28.163 --> 21:29.581
What a dork.

21:31.374 --> 21:32.375
Trick or treat.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.003
Trick or treat.

21:35.837 --> 21:38.715
-Candy.
-Aw. Here, take five.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.176
-Yay!
-

21:41.801 --> 21:43.011
Thanks.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.846
Aren't you too old for trick or treat?

21:51.353 --> 21:52.562
What the heck?

21:55.940 --> 21:57.609
Aw.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.570
Bye.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.076
Unbelievable.

22:10.372 --> 22:13.416
Come on, guys.
We need to pick up the pace a little.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.709
You guys are killing me.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.966
-

22:26.596 --> 22:27.806
Hi.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.934
Is that a cute little pirate I see?

22:31.017 --> 22:32.018
Mm-hmm.

22:34.104 --> 22:35.063
Aw.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.232
Here's some extra booty for your bucket.

22:37.315 --> 22:38.733
-Biggie!
-Seriously?

22:38.817 --> 22:41.903
King-size?
It'll take you a week to get through that.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.029
Bubby!

22:47.492 --> 22:48.493
Hmm…

22:49.661 --> 22:51.913
-Do you see what's happening here, Rowley?
-Hmm? Aw.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.707
This kid's our golden ticket!
-

22:58.420 --> 23:00.422
-Hmm?
-

23:00.505 --> 23:02.132
Aw.

23:02.215 --> 23:03.967
There you go.
-

23:04.050 --> 23:05.218
Oh, yes!

23:05.301 --> 23:07.178
Yay!

23:08.930 --> 23:10.348
Bubby! Candy!

23:14.352 --> 23:16.563
I can't believe we never thought
of bringing Manny.

23:16.646 --> 23:18.857
-This kid's a gold mine.
-Yeah.

23:18.940 --> 23:21.526
So we'll stop by my house,
empty these bags in my room,

23:21.609 --> 23:23.445
then head back out for another round,
okay?

23:23.528 --> 23:27.490
I don't know. I mean, Manny looks tired.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.367
He's fine. Aren't you, Manny?

23:32.412 --> 23:33.621
See? That was a nod.

23:33.705 --> 23:36.541
-Actually, I'm kind of tired too.
-

23:37.125 --> 23:40.170
Come on, Rowley.
We can stock up on candy for the year!

23:40.253 --> 23:42.255
We can't let this opportunity go to waste.

23:42.339 --> 23:44.132
But we don't need that much candy.

23:44.215 --> 23:47.093
Seriously?
You can never have too much candy, Rowley.

23:47.177 --> 23:50.430
Candy's like money in middle school.
We can buy someone's lunch seats off them.

23:51.765 --> 23:53.975
How about just like
a couple more houses, okay?

23:55.560 --> 23:56.728
It's the end of the night.

23:56.811 --> 23:58.646
Everyone's looking
to get rid of their candy.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.940
-We can make a killing.
-I don't know.

24:01.024 --> 24:03.902
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna hit Whirley Street.

24:03.985 --> 24:06.821
Whirley Street?
But that's like a mile from here.

24:06.905 --> 24:09.324
-Not if we take a shortcut.
-Snake Road?

24:09.866 --> 24:12.827
-Don't you remember what your mom said?
-She'll never even know.

24:12.911 --> 24:16.414
Twenty more minutes and we'll be back
at my house eating our candy. I promise.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.751
We're not little kids anymore.

24:30.178 --> 24:31.721
All right. That's my boy.

24:57.205 --> 24:59.207
I-- I think we made a mistake.

24:59.290 --> 25:02.085
It's gonna be worth it, Rowley.
Just think about all the candy.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.004
I don't even like candy all that much.

25:04.087 --> 25:07.090
Rowley, do not say that.
Don't even joke about it.

25:07.173 --> 25:10.802
Do you think the Goat Man is gonna get us?

25:10.885 --> 25:13.763
Are you kidding me, Rowley?
That's obviously a made-up story.

25:13.847 --> 25:17.517
-Rodrick was just trying to scare us.
-That's what you said about the cheese.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.352
And that was real.

25:19.436 --> 25:22.063
Yeah, well, a half-man, half-goat?

25:22.147 --> 25:24.274
It's not even physically possible, Rowley.

25:25.442 --> 25:28.445
-

25:32.949 --> 25:33.950
But--

25:34.034 --> 25:36.494
But if the Goat Man was real,

25:36.578 --> 25:39.622
do you think he's a goat on the top
and a person on the bottom?

25:40.248 --> 25:41.791
Or the other way around?

25:42.459 --> 25:44.502
Or do you think
he's got a split down the middle

25:44.586 --> 25:47.047
with a goat on the left side
and a person on the right?

25:48.214 --> 25:50.967
Can we stop talking about this?
I think I hear some--

25:51.051 --> 25:54.304
-

25:56.056 --> 25:58.308
-

25:58.391 --> 25:59.476
Teenagers!

26:00.143 --> 26:01.978
♪ Breaking the law, breaking the law ♪

26:02.062 --> 26:04.230
Whoa! That was close!

26:04.773 --> 26:07.776
Yeah. Um, let's just keep moving before--

26:10.987 --> 26:12.364
-

26:16.868 --> 26:19.412
♪ Breaking the law, breaking the law ♪

26:20.038 --> 26:21.539
♪ Breaking the law, breaking the law ♪

26:22.791 --> 26:23.958
♪ Breaking the law, break-- ♪

26:24.042 --> 26:25.627
-

26:25.710 --> 26:29.547
Look at these little nerds,
out past their bedtimes.

26:29.631 --> 26:33.760
Yeah. Shouldn't you be getting
a good night's sleep?

26:39.307 --> 26:42.185
Actually, we're in middle school.
My bedtime's not until 9:00.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.604
Mom let me stay up extra tonight.

26:44.688 --> 26:47.565
Yeah, we-- we better head home.
Have a good night, fellas.

26:48.650 --> 26:51.528
Ooh! Look at those bags.
Is that all candy?

26:52.070 --> 26:55.740
Mostly. But my parents handed out
miniature toothbrushes this year,

26:55.824 --> 26:57.409
so we've got those too.

26:57.492 --> 27:00.954
We-- We'd really better get going now.

27:01.037 --> 27:05.083
It would be a real pity
if that candy got wet.

27:12.048 --> 27:15.135
-

27:17.804 --> 27:19.139
-What?
-Huh?

27:22.434 --> 27:23.643
-

27:23.727 --> 27:25.895
Greg, run!

27:30.650 --> 27:32.277
Let's go!

27:39.784 --> 27:41.369
Hang on to Manny!

27:49.961 --> 27:51.796
Whoa!

27:55.216 --> 27:56.843
-Yeah!
-

28:07.729 --> 28:09.647
Yeah, baby!

28:11.399 --> 28:13.151
Not so fast!

28:14.319 --> 28:15.236
Whoo!

28:18.365 --> 28:20.867
-

28:20.950 --> 28:22.994
Whoa!
-

28:34.214 --> 28:35.256
Oh, yes!

28:36.633 --> 28:38.802
You'll pay for this!

28:42.514 --> 28:44.766
We know where you go to school!

28:48.770 --> 28:50.021
-Whoa!
-

28:59.739 --> 29:00.740
Is this…

29:01.658 --> 29:03.868
My yard! We made it, Rowley.

29:03.952 --> 29:05.453
We're alive!

29:06.579 --> 29:07.622
I told you, Rowley.

29:07.706 --> 29:10.000
If you just stick with me,
everything will be fine.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.544
Now let's get inside
and enjoy some of this candy.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.715
Ha ha! Oh!

29:16.798 --> 29:19.634
Sorry. I-I thought you were teenagers.

29:19.718 --> 29:20.844
Are you all right?

29:21.428 --> 29:22.554
You're all right.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.432
We were worried sick about you two.

29:25.515 --> 29:26.766
-Mama.
-Where were you boys?

29:28.018 --> 29:29.519
Snake Road.

29:30.687 --> 29:31.813
Busted.

29:31.896 --> 29:34.691
Mom grounded me
from playing video games for a week,

29:34.774 --> 29:36.151
which is her go-to punishment.

29:36.234 --> 29:39.904
That meant I had to figure out something
else to do with my time after school.

29:39.988 --> 29:41.031
Woo-hoo!

29:42.615 --> 29:43.616
Woo-hoo!

29:50.248 --> 29:53.084
I'm thinking I might either
run for student council

29:53.168 --> 29:56.671
or maybe sign up for the dance committee.
Or maybe I'll try out for the play.

29:56.755 --> 29:59.132
-They're doing Wizard of Oz this year.
-Uh-huh.

29:59.215 --> 30:00.925
Chirag Gupta wants to be Toto,

30:01.009 --> 30:04.596
and Patty Farrell says
Mrs. Norton already promised her Dorothy.

30:04.679 --> 30:08.683
I'm trying to decide if I wanna try out
for the Scarecrow or the Cowardly Lion.

30:08.767 --> 30:11.478
Sounds great, Rowley.
Can you go now?

30:11.561 --> 30:13.605
Well,
aren't you gonna sign up for anything?

30:13.688 --> 30:17.692
My mom says, "It's important to belong to
something when you're in middle school."

30:17.776 --> 30:18.985
Belong to something?

30:19.069 --> 30:22.113
Rowley, I can't even get a seat at lunch,
and I'm sick and tired of it.

30:22.197 --> 30:23.406
But if we were in the play,

30:23.490 --> 30:26.576
we could make friends who could invite us
to sit at their lunch table.

30:26.659 --> 30:29.704
That's a lot of work, Rowley.
And it'll take too much of my time.

30:29.788 --> 30:31.373
I need to change my situation now!

30:40.590 --> 30:42.050
Oh, yeah!

30:43.468 --> 30:45.970
Whoa!

30:46.054 --> 30:47.305
Hey, oh!

30:47.972 --> 30:49.057
Rowley!

30:50.642 --> 30:53.978
You okay? I feel so bad!
I really didn't mean to flip you.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.399
I think I hurt my arm.

30:57.482 --> 30:59.984
Yeah, I think I might have pulled
something myself.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.821
Can you believe that throw though?
I mean--

31:04.406 --> 31:05.448
Ow.

31:05.532 --> 31:07.158
Oh, man. You're really hurt.

31:09.202 --> 31:10.870
I think I'd better go home.

31:11.413 --> 31:14.374
Okay. But you can't tell your parents
how this happened.

31:14.457 --> 31:17.335
If my mom found out
we were playing this game, she'd go nuts.

31:17.419 --> 31:20.046
-I'm already grounded.
-What am I supposed to tell them then?

31:20.130 --> 31:23.174
Just say you were playing tag
and that you tripped on the curb.

31:23.258 --> 31:25.802
But whatever you do,
don't mention the Rumble Trike.

31:29.097 --> 31:30.098
Got it?

31:30.682 --> 31:31.683
Got it.

31:38.148 --> 31:41.192
So what happened at the hospital?
- They took a bunch of X-rays.

31:41.276 --> 31:43.236
The doctor says my arm is broken.

31:43.319 --> 31:44.404
Broken?

31:44.487 --> 31:47.032
Oh, man. I thought it was just
bruised or something.

31:47.115 --> 31:49.909
Nope. I've got a cast and everything.

31:49.993 --> 31:52.120
A cast? That's serious!

31:52.203 --> 31:53.580
Yeah, I know.

31:53.663 --> 31:55.874
I mean,
that's really awful and everything.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.626
-But do you know what this means?
-Yeah.

31:58.710 --> 32:02.339
I have to put a plastic bag over my arm
in the shower for a whole month.

32:02.422 --> 32:05.342
No! What this means for school.

32:06.259 --> 32:10.096
I guess I can't do
the wrestling unit in Phys Ed?

32:10.180 --> 32:13.183
Rowley! A cast is the greatest
thing that can happen to a kid.

32:13.266 --> 32:15.060
-It is?
-Yes, Rowley.

32:15.143 --> 32:18.229
-Everyone's gonna wanna sign it.
-What? They will?

32:18.313 --> 32:21.191
Yes. Kids will be begging you
to sit at their lunch table.

32:21.274 --> 32:22.275
Yeah.

32:22.359 --> 32:24.861
And I hope you'll remember
who your real friends are, Rowley.

32:24.944 --> 32:27.030
The people who helped you get
to where you are.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.823
-Yeah.
-What about your parents?

32:28.907 --> 32:29.991
Are they suspicious?

32:30.075 --> 32:33.328
I told them I tripped on a rock
playing Duck, Duck, Goose, like you said.

32:33.411 --> 32:34.746
Like I said?

32:34.829 --> 32:37.957
We were playing tag, Rowley!
And you tripped over the curb.

32:38.041 --> 32:41.586
It doesn't even make sense for two people
to play Duck, Duck, Goose. Come on!

32:41.670 --> 32:45.382
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.
-We gotta get our story straight,

32:45.465 --> 32:47.384
or they're gonna find out
about the Rumble Trike.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.594
Did you say, "Rumble Trike"?

32:55.600 --> 32:57.936
I don't know
what to do with you, Greg.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.689
First you disobey me and go to Snake Road.

33:00.772 --> 33:02.774
Then you play that-- that game.

33:02.857 --> 33:05.819
I told you someone
was going to get hurt playing that.

33:05.902 --> 33:07.737
I'm sorry, Mom. I just…

33:10.990 --> 33:12.992
Lying to me is bad enough,

33:13.076 --> 33:17.539
but telling Rowley to lie to his parents
is just-- just--

33:20.333 --> 33:21.543
Mom, I know I messed up.

33:22.585 --> 33:24.921
You can take away my video games
for the month.

33:25.005 --> 33:26.631
The year if it makes you feel better.

33:26.715 --> 33:29.884
Punishing you doesn't make me feel better,
Greg.

33:29.968 --> 33:31.761
I'm trying to raise a good kid.

33:31.845 --> 33:33.513
I do wanna be good, Mom.

33:34.639 --> 33:36.224
Well, then here's what you need to do.

33:36.307 --> 33:40.061
You need to figure out a way
to make things right by Rowley.

33:41.104 --> 33:42.522
You owe that to him.

33:43.273 --> 33:45.608
That boy is such a good friend to you.

33:46.484 --> 33:47.485
Yeah, Mom.

33:48.361 --> 33:50.488
I can't tell you how to make things right.

33:51.322 --> 33:52.699
That part is up to you.

33:56.244 --> 33:59.914
-But Mom…
-Listen to that inner voice, Greg.

34:01.041 --> 34:02.375
I know it's in there.

34:03.126 --> 34:04.377
Do the right thing.

34:10.175 --> 34:12.844
Okay,
I know what my mom wanted me to do.

34:12.927 --> 34:15.930
She wanted me to tell Rowley's parents
the truth about what happened.

34:16.973 --> 34:20.643
But here's the thing.
Rowley's dad has never really liked me.

34:20.727 --> 34:23.063
I knew if I told him what really happened,

34:23.146 --> 34:25.607
it was just gonna make him
like me even less.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.317
That wouldn't make things any better.

34:28.026 --> 34:29.903
I don't wanna get Rowley in trouble
for lying,

34:29.986 --> 34:31.780
'cause then he'd be in trouble too.

34:31.863 --> 34:36.618
So, I decided the right thing to do
was to just let things be.

34:40.872 --> 34:43.750
Because telling the truth
would make things worse for everybody.

34:54.886 --> 34:56.971
-Ooh.
-Oh, my gosh. What happened?

34:57.055 --> 34:59.265
-It looks so cool.
-Oh, you're so great.

35:00.183 --> 35:01.184
Can I sign it?

35:01.267 --> 35:03.812
And I'll tell you another thing
that I was right about.

35:05.438 --> 35:08.775
That cast. In fact, it worked even better
than I thought it would.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.320
It's so cool.

35:14.656 --> 35:17.909
Just like I predicted, getting
a seat at lunch was no problem at all.

35:24.958 --> 35:26.835
Well,
at least for Rowley it wasn't a problem.

35:26.918 --> 35:29.379
Here comes the airplane.

35:29.462 --> 35:32.882
-

35:32.966 --> 35:35.677
-Nom!
-Here comes the train!

35:35.760 --> 35:39.556
Chugga chugga chugga, choo choo!

35:41.891 --> 35:43.643
He can feed himself just fine, okay?

35:43.727 --> 35:45.228
Mmm.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.022
You know Rowley's left-handed?

35:47.105 --> 35:48.356
Who are you?

35:48.440 --> 35:51.234
I'm Greg Heffley, Rowley's best friend.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.819
I'm the one who broke his arm.

35:53.987 --> 35:55.030
You jerk!

35:55.113 --> 35:56.364
Get out of here.
- Heads up!

36:00.410 --> 36:02.328
I couldn't have Rowley
hog all the attention,

36:02.412 --> 36:04.581
so I decided to whip up
an injury of my own.

36:15.592 --> 36:19.054
It's just an infection caused by
a splinter that was left untreated.

36:23.224 --> 36:24.434
-Hey.
-

36:24.517 --> 36:26.770
Can I peek at your infection?

36:26.853 --> 36:27.979
Ew.

36:29.105 --> 36:31.858
I realized I couldn't compete
with Rowley's stupid injury.

36:34.152 --> 36:36.196
So that meant I needed
to find something of my own.

36:36.279 --> 36:38.323
And just like that, I did.

36:51.961 --> 36:54.255
Hey, Greg.
I couldn't find you after school.

36:54.339 --> 36:55.340
Huh?

36:55.423 --> 36:57.842
Sorry. I wanted to go home
and start working on my comics.

36:57.926 --> 37:00.136
Your comics? For what?

37:00.220 --> 37:01.388
The school paper.

37:01.471 --> 37:04.099
One of the cartoonists quit,
so now there's a spot open.

37:07.769 --> 37:08.895
Can I help?

37:08.978 --> 37:11.106
Sorry, Rowley. There's only one spot open.

37:16.444 --> 37:18.071
Zoo-Wee Mama!

37:19.489 --> 37:21.074
This is funny!

37:22.409 --> 37:24.744
"Oops. I've stepped in a puddle!

37:25.245 --> 37:28.248
Well, at least it's not an acid puddle!

37:28.873 --> 37:33.086
Ah! It is an acid puddle!

37:33.169 --> 37:35.005
Zoo-Wee Mama!"

37:35.088 --> 37:38.717
Zoo-Wee Mama!
Do you have any more like this one?

37:38.800 --> 37:40.427
I'm working on something better.

37:40.510 --> 37:43.179
Check this one out.
It's called "Creighton the Cretin."

37:43.263 --> 37:47.642
"Hiya, doc! Can I get a new butt?
My old one has a crack in it."

37:47.726 --> 37:50.437
"Everyone's butt has a crack in it,
you idiot!"

37:50.520 --> 37:51.521
"Oops."

37:52.480 --> 37:54.399
But when does he say, "Zoo-Wee Mama"?

37:54.482 --> 37:55.692
He doesn't.

37:55.775 --> 37:59.738
I think it'd be funnier if he said,
"Zoo-Wee Mama!"

38:02.782 --> 38:06.036
You know what? If you wanna draw
your own comic, be my guest.

38:06.119 --> 38:08.371
But we always do everything together.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.416
Yeah, well, not this time. Sorry.

38:12.542 --> 38:14.753
But can we be partners?

38:14.836 --> 38:16.838
You can write the comic,
and I can draw it.

38:17.589 --> 38:20.175
No offense, Rowley,
but you don't even draw noses on people.

38:20.258 --> 38:24.304
Sorry. This is kinda my thing,
like the way Joshie's your thing.

38:24.387 --> 38:28.308
Okay. Well, I guess I'll go work
on my comic at my house.

38:29.142 --> 38:30.185
Sounds good.

38:38.651 --> 38:39.736
See ya.

38:43.782 --> 38:47.077
-

38:47.160 --> 38:50.497
After I turned in my comic,
all I could do was wait.

38:51.289 --> 38:53.583
But after a whole week went by,

38:54.709 --> 38:56.628
Mr. Humphreys made an announcement.

38:56.711 --> 38:59.422
Attention, students.
After careful consideration,

38:59.506 --> 39:02.634
we've made a decision
on the cartoonist for the school paper.

39:02.717 --> 39:04.469
And the new cartoonist is…

39:05.178 --> 39:08.014
-Greg Heffley.
-Yes! Yes!

39:10.725 --> 39:13.478
This is possibly the biggest thing
that has ever happened to me.

39:14.729 --> 39:17.148
-That's the dude?
-He wrote that?

39:18.400 --> 39:19.818
Is that cartoon kid?

39:22.779 --> 39:24.948
For the first time since I stepped
through those double doors,

39:25.031 --> 39:26.700
I wasn't invisible.

39:26.783 --> 39:28.284
-Teacher's pet!

39:28.368 --> 39:30.286
Aren't comics supposed
to make you laugh?

39:30.370 --> 39:31.579
"Creighton the Curious Student."

39:31.663 --> 39:33.248
Did you think that was funny?
-What the--

39:33.331 --> 39:38.336
"Teacher, if x plus 43 is 89,
what would x be?"

39:38.420 --> 39:40.046
"Why, it would be 46!"

39:40.130 --> 39:43.299
"Thanks! Kids,
if you'd like to learn more about math,

39:43.383 --> 39:45.677
have Mr. Humphreys show you around

39:45.760 --> 39:49.139
the newly expanded
math and science section of the library."

39:49.222 --> 39:53.309
"And thanks to the Parent-Teacher
Organization for funding the new section.

39:53.393 --> 39:55.729
Our old books were badly outdated."

39:55.812 --> 39:57.230
They changed it?

39:57.313 --> 39:59.899
-Teacher's pet!
-Thanks for ruining my day.

39:59.983 --> 40:01.735
-What a waste of ink.
-Nerd!

40:04.904 --> 40:06.865
Boo!

40:06.948 --> 40:07.949
Teacher's pet!

40:08.033 --> 40:09.409
See? That's what happens

40:09.492 --> 40:11.953
when the school librarian
is in charge of the newspaper.

40:12.037 --> 40:14.080
They've always gotta get pushy
with their books.

40:16.041 --> 40:17.542
One week after I quit,

40:17.625 --> 40:21.171
Mr. Humphreys chose someone to replace me,
and you'll never believe who he picked.

40:21.254 --> 40:23.131
Zoo-Wee Mama!
-

40:26.426 --> 40:27.886
Zoo-Wee Mama!

40:32.390 --> 40:35.977
Zoo-Wee Mama!
-Zoo-Wee Mama!

40:37.145 --> 40:39.356
Zoo-Wee Mama!

40:41.858 --> 40:43.568
Zoo-Wee Mama!

40:47.155 --> 40:50.200
"Hey, pretty lady.
Do you wanna go on a date?"

40:50.283 --> 40:53.411
"I'm actually not a lady.
I'm one of those dogs with long hair.

40:53.495 --> 40:55.330
So, no thanks to that date."

40:55.413 --> 40:57.207
"Zoo-Wee Mama!"

40:57.290 --> 41:01.878
So a kid who can barely draw
got his comic in the school paper?

41:01.961 --> 41:05.298
It's totally unfair.
Why didn't they censor Rowley's work?

41:13.598 --> 41:15.183
You stole my comic.

41:15.266 --> 41:17.310
You said you didn't wanna do it anymore.

41:17.394 --> 41:20.146
Well, couldn't you come up
with something original for once, Rowley?

41:20.230 --> 41:22.732
Well, I can't help it
if I'm just naturally funny.

41:22.816 --> 41:24.359
Zoo-Wee Mama!

41:24.442 --> 41:25.777
Zoo-Wee Mama!

41:25.860 --> 41:29.114
-Zoo-Wee Mama!
- Zoo-Wee Mama!

41:31.866 --> 41:35.745
You know what? I hope you enjoy all this,
because I'm tired of carrying you.

41:35.829 --> 41:37.747
Maybe it's the other way around.

41:37.831 --> 41:40.917
This comic, this lunch table, that cast.

41:41.001 --> 41:43.378
You wouldn't have any of it
if it wasn't for me!

41:43.461 --> 41:45.547
Yeah, because you broke my arm.

41:45.630 --> 41:46.840
Yeah. You're welcome.

41:54.180 --> 41:57.100
Rowley deserves your respect.
-

41:58.560 --> 42:00.895
-Zoo-Wee Mama!
- Oh!

42:02.063 --> 42:03.815
Okay, I'll admit.

42:03.898 --> 42:06.609
Maybe I could have handled
the situation at lunch a little better.

42:06.693 --> 42:08.028
But I figured, after a while,

42:08.111 --> 42:10.447
me and Rowley would cool down,
things would go back to normal.

42:10.530 --> 42:12.574
So do you like DinoBlasters?

42:12.657 --> 42:13.658
No.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.618
I love it.

42:20.123 --> 42:22.167
Thing is, that hasn't happened yet.

42:28.882 --> 42:31.968
Rowley's been hanging out
with this kid Chirag every day.

42:32.052 --> 42:34.721
You know the only reason he's doing it
is to make me jealous.

42:36.639 --> 42:38.933
But two can play at that game.

42:43.188 --> 42:45.190
-You wanna see my room?
-Yeah.

43:06.795 --> 43:07.796
Yes! Come on!

43:24.187 --> 43:28.817
The one and only Greg Heffley
is on my front step.

43:30.860 --> 43:32.987
Yeah, I guess I am.

43:33.947 --> 43:36.825
So I was thinking,
me and you are neighbors.

43:36.908 --> 43:37.909
Yeah. Uh-huh.

43:37.992 --> 43:40.745
But we barely even know each other.

43:40.829 --> 43:42.330
How'd you feel about a sleepover?

43:42.414 --> 43:43.415
Tonight?

43:43.998 --> 43:46.835
Yeah. Right now.
You and me. Just a couple of pals.

43:46.918 --> 43:48.753
Woo-hoo! Come on in.

44:04.102 --> 44:06.354
-

44:09.441 --> 44:12.152
You know, maybe we should take this
one step at a time.

44:12.235 --> 44:15.947
How about if we just play
a quick game of cards and call it a night?

44:19.159 --> 44:20.577
-

44:20.660 --> 44:23.163
Hey, Greg.

44:28.585 --> 44:29.794
-

44:29.878 --> 44:32.881
Oh, Fregley.
Do you have a playmate over?

44:32.964 --> 44:35.675
Would you like for me
to knit him some socks?

44:35.759 --> 44:38.303
Yep. I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna be in therapy over this.

44:40.221 --> 44:41.598
Whoo!

44:41.681 --> 44:43.725
Greg Heffley's in my room.

44:44.642 --> 44:45.685
Woo-hoo!

44:46.311 --> 44:48.396
Yeah, but just for a short visit.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.023
In fact, I really need to be--

44:50.106 --> 44:51.608
You wanna play make-believe?

44:52.150 --> 44:55.862
You can be the church organist,
and I'll be the school hygienist.

44:58.114 --> 45:00.950
You know, that's tempting.
But I'm not really into--

45:01.034 --> 45:03.411
How about a tickle fight?

45:03.912 --> 45:06.081
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

45:06.164 --> 45:08.208
I'm gonna tickle, tickle.

45:08.291 --> 45:10.293
I got you. I'm tickling you. Ha ha!

45:12.087 --> 45:14.047
Hey! What are you doing?

45:14.130 --> 45:15.465
Give me some space here.

45:15.548 --> 45:17.092
Can't you just stay over there?

45:17.175 --> 45:20.178
Well, what do you wanna do then?

45:22.722 --> 45:24.432
I don't know. I thought if we…

45:26.559 --> 45:29.020
Mmm.

45:29.104 --> 45:32.565
Fregley! That's the only candy bar
I had that wasn't wet.

45:32.649 --> 45:34.859
Mom never lets me have chocolate.

45:34.943 --> 45:39.447
Says it makes me hyperactive and unstable.

45:42.659 --> 45:46.204
-Fregley, are you okay? Fregley!
-

45:46.287 --> 45:48.331
I've blocked out big parts
of that night.

45:48.915 --> 45:51.376
Hey, Greg.

45:51.960 --> 45:54.796
I'm so glad I can't remember
every little thing that happened.

45:58.883 --> 45:59.926
-Hey!

46:00.510 --> 46:02.595
But what I do remember

46:03.096 --> 46:05.306
is that I ended up
locked up in Fregley's bathroom

46:05.390 --> 46:07.684
while I waited
for his sugar high to wear off.

46:16.818 --> 46:18.361
Dear Gregory,

46:18.445 --> 46:21.906
I'm sorry I ate your candy
and chased you with a booger.

46:21.990 --> 46:25.535
Here, I put it on this piece of paper
so you can get me back.

46:25.618 --> 46:27.579
Signed, Fregley.

46:28.830 --> 46:30.165
What the--

46:31.833 --> 46:34.210
But if I could, I would forget everything.

47:09.496 --> 47:11.498
-

47:16.461 --> 47:18.505
Hey, Greg. Hey!

47:18.588 --> 47:20.215
Oh, hey. Hey, Rowley. What's up?

47:20.298 --> 47:22.217
I was wondering
if I could stop by your house today

47:22.300 --> 47:24.094
and pick up my copy of Twisted Wizard.

47:24.177 --> 47:25.762
Me and Chirag want to play it.

47:27.055 --> 47:30.266
Yeah, well, I've had it for a while,
so it's kind of mine now.

47:30.350 --> 47:32.894
I guess you and your new friend
will have to find something else to do.

47:32.977 --> 47:36.189
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm not the only one
with a new friend.

47:36.272 --> 47:37.399
You mean Fregley?

47:37.482 --> 47:39.484
I'm permanently scarred from that night.

47:39.567 --> 47:41.611
And it's all your fault for ditching me.

47:41.695 --> 47:44.155
I ditched you?
More like the other way around.

47:44.239 --> 47:47.450
You haven't been the same ever since
you got that stupid cast.

47:47.534 --> 47:48.702
-You've changed.
-Fight!

47:48.785 --> 47:50.495
-Oh, yeah?
- They're gonna fight.

47:50.578 --> 47:52.706
Well, you're the one who broke my arm.

47:52.789 --> 47:54.624
You can take him. Knock him down!

47:55.375 --> 47:57.627
Guys, come over. Come check out the fight.

47:58.962 --> 48:01.881
Why don't you make a move?
- Unless you're chicken.

48:01.965 --> 48:04.509
Fight, fight, fight!

48:04.592 --> 48:08.054
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

48:08.638 --> 48:10.807
Where'd you learn to fight?
Ballerina school?

48:10.890 --> 48:13.351
If you don't do something,
I'm gonna fall asleep.

48:13.435 --> 48:15.937
Who taught you how to fight? Your granny?

48:16.021 --> 48:18.857
Are you two gonna fight
or keep dancing with each other?

48:19.649 --> 48:21.568
Do they even know how to do this?

48:23.445 --> 48:24.946
-

48:25.030 --> 48:27.365
-Let's get out of here!
-Come on. Let's go!

48:31.745 --> 48:34.581
Well, look who it is.

48:34.664 --> 48:36.958
Our little friends from Halloween.

48:38.084 --> 48:39.878
We told you we'd find you.

48:39.961 --> 48:42.922
And now you're gonna pay
for busting my tire.

48:44.591 --> 48:47.927
But, like, how are they gonna pay?

48:48.011 --> 48:50.347
Yeah. Do you mean, like, with money?

48:50.430 --> 48:52.390
'Cause not everybody
carries cash these days.

48:52.474 --> 48:53.892
No, you morons.

48:53.975 --> 48:57.228
Pay, as in, like, revenge.

48:58.563 --> 49:02.359
Okay. Now we're all on the same page.

49:04.819 --> 49:08.031
Okay. Now what?

49:08.114 --> 49:09.991
I am thinking.

49:10.075 --> 49:11.076
Ooh! Ooh!

49:11.159 --> 49:13.370
-You still got that fire extinguisher?
-

49:13.453 --> 49:20.001
Nah. My mom made me
put it back in the house for "fires."

49:24.964 --> 49:26.841
What's this one looking at?

49:26.925 --> 49:29.177
Uh, it looks like…

49:30.345 --> 49:31.638
Cheese!

49:31.721 --> 49:35.475
-

49:35.558 --> 49:37.519
Now, I really can't say
what happened next.

49:37.602 --> 49:40.313
Because if Rowley ever tries to run
for president when he grows up

49:40.397 --> 49:42.607
and people find out
what those teenagers made him do,

49:42.691 --> 49:44.234
he won't have a chance.

49:46.486 --> 49:47.821
So all I'm gonna say

49:47.904 --> 49:50.031
is that the teenagers made Rowley

49:50.115 --> 49:53.660
-blank, blank, blank the cheese.
-

49:58.331 --> 50:00.625
Okay. You're next.

50:00.709 --> 50:04.754
No. But I just had lunch.
I'm not even really that hungry.

50:04.838 --> 50:06.423
You're not getting out of this.

50:06.506 --> 50:09.050
But, um, I'm lactose intolerant.

50:10.301 --> 50:12.137
It'll make me gassy.

50:29.988 --> 50:33.033
-Huh?

50:33.116 --> 50:34.659
Get out of here, you punks!

50:41.750 --> 50:42.751
You boys okay?

50:46.921 --> 50:48.882
What happened?
-They're gone.

50:48.965 --> 50:51.259
-What's going on?
-What's going on over here?

50:51.343 --> 50:52.844
The cheese!

50:52.927 --> 50:54.804
Look! There's--

50:54.888 --> 50:56.723
There's a piece missing!

50:56.806 --> 50:58.475
What?
- What?

51:01.811 --> 51:03.521
-Disgusting!
- Ew!

51:04.230 --> 51:07.484
Trust me, I was tempted to tell
everyone the truth about what happened,

51:07.567 --> 51:10.028
but then
I heard that annoying inner voice.

51:10.612 --> 51:12.697
Do the right thing, Greg.

51:12.781 --> 51:15.492
That's all you need to get by
in this world, you know?

51:15.575 --> 51:17.035
One good friend.

51:17.118 --> 51:18.661
Somebody has the Cheese Touch.

51:18.745 --> 51:20.997
Rowley Jefferson ate the--

51:21.081 --> 51:22.207
No!

51:22.290 --> 51:26.211
It was me! Those teenagers
dared me to do it, and I did it!

51:26.294 --> 51:28.046
So what? No big deal.

51:28.129 --> 51:32.884
-Greg Heffley has the Cheese Touch!
-

51:32.967 --> 51:35.804
He has the Cheese Touch.
- Oh, ew!

51:37.389 --> 51:38.723
The Cheese Touch!

51:41.434 --> 51:44.354
Okay, so I might have
bent the truth a little,

51:44.437 --> 51:47.982
but sometimes you have to do
that sort of thing to help a friend.

51:48.733 --> 51:49.734
So, uh…

51:50.276 --> 51:52.529
you, uh, wanna go to my place

51:52.612 --> 51:55.907
and, I don't know,
play some Twisted Wizard?

51:55.990 --> 51:58.243
Yeah. That'd be good.

52:05.083 --> 52:07.961
Oh, man. I totally would've had you.

52:08.044 --> 52:11.297
Are you kidding?
You were totally about to start crying.

52:11.381 --> 52:13.299
I had something in my eye.

52:13.967 --> 52:16.094
I could've taken you
with my eyes closed.

52:16.177 --> 52:18.471
I could've beaten you
with my little pinkie.

52:20.265 --> 52:22.976
Having the Cheese Touch
hasn't been as bad as I thought.

52:23.059 --> 52:24.060
Cheese Touch!

52:26.771 --> 52:29.065
The kids at school
give me plenty of space.

52:30.150 --> 52:31.901
And it's not just in the hallways.

52:32.902 --> 52:35.155
I've pretty much got the run of the place.

52:38.241 --> 52:39.534
And the best part is,

52:39.617 --> 52:42.871
getting a seat at lunch
is not a problem anymore.

52:44.622 --> 52:45.623
-Run!
-

52:45.707 --> 52:48.710
In fact,
I've got a whole table to myself.

52:55.258 --> 52:58.386
Well, maybe not entirely to myself,
but I'm fine with it.

53:00.221 --> 53:02.349
And things are good with me and Rowley.

53:02.432 --> 53:04.184
In fact, they're better than good.

53:08.355 --> 53:10.357
But if Rowley ever steps out of line,

53:10.440 --> 53:13.401
I'll let everyone know
who really ate the you-know-what.

53:16.154 --> 53:18.239
Come on. Almost there.

53:18.323 --> 53:19.741
-

53:19.824 --> 53:21.326
-I got you.
-
