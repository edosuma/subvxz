- Just got a call from Ted.

01:19.567 --> 01:21.467
We got a big salvage
job at a farmhouse.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.467
Farm house?

01:22.600 --> 01:24.033
Yeah, the first
salvage job for me.

01:24.166 --> 01:26.266
Well, I hope you bring back more
than he did because

01:26.400 --> 01:27.934

he brought back

01:28.066 --> 01:31.467

generation Priestly.

01:47.066 --> 01:49.033
Okay, Justin.
This is not light.

He's spent every summer
working at this company

01:51.600 --> 01:53.600

01:53.734 --> 01:55.700
He's been in college
for the last year.

01:55.834 --> 01:57.667
One day, he'll take
over the business.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.600
But he's gotta learn
it from the ground up.

01:59.734 --> 02:00.867
Whoa.

The salvage, the machinery.
He's gotta know it all.

02:04.300 --> 02:07.300
So, I'm gonna crunch and
Julien's gonna be my labourer?

No, he's not a
labourer anymore.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.834
He was my labourer
5 years ago.

So, I'm gonna be the labourer?
Julien's gonna smash?

Can't wait to
crawl around.

basement and the attic.

secret agenda there.

some good stuff.

02:34.734 --> 02:36.200
Well, I'm pumped about it.
I know.

It's cool.

They look beautiful.

04:05.033 --> 04:06.367

Been around for a while.

that if it spun, maybe 2, 250.

the radio part
is super cool.

05:03.367 --> 05:06.233
The turntable's a bit rough,
but I just like that style.

05:06.367 --> 05:07.767
It could be repurposed.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.967
Back in the day, farmers
didn't throw stuff away.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.100
They might use it again,
so they might have thought,

05:12.233 --> 05:14.700
we'll maybe use that old
record player one of these days

05:14.834 --> 05:18.133

just cover it up.

Alright, let's go.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.500
I don't hear any
working down here.

08:11.633 --> 08:12.967
- Oh!
- How you making out?

08:13.100 --> 08:15.133
- Found a door.
- Holy, nice.

08:15.266 --> 08:16.667
There's a door back there.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.333
The upstairs was a blowout,
but we got a door.

08:19.467 --> 08:22.767
So, we're going in.
Ready? Whoa.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.033
This is like the
master of all jackpots.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.467
Oh, look at this.
Holy ----!

08:27.600 --> 08:28.700
Holy!

08:28.834 --> 08:30.500
This is the
original exterior wall.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.867
- Look at the size of that one.
- They're huge.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.500
Look how dry
they are though.

08:34.633 --> 08:37.633
- That's cool.
- Look at that.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.567
Interesting though, eh?
Why is this here?

08:40.700 --> 08:42.033
I'm curious how
high that goes.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.667
Shoot it up there, Julien.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.367
That little room was
totally sealed off.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.333
I have no idea why,
but in this business,

08:49.467 --> 08:51.900
nothing surprises me
anymore.

08:52.033 --> 08:54.500
That's all hand-hewn.
That's wicked, man.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.000
That's what
they worked with.

08:56.133 --> 08:58.433
That's the old, old
growth pine right there.

08:58.567 --> 08:59.900
Big, huge logs.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.166
They cut 'em down,
hewn 'em off, stack 'em.

09:03.300 --> 09:07.633
That's when it was made.
Late 1700s, early 1800 style.

09:07.767 --> 09:10.266
I wonder if this is an
original 1800 panic room.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.667
- (laughs) Panic room.
- An original 1800 panic room.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.133
I'm thinking this wall
would have been left as

09:15.266 --> 09:16.700
a structural wall for
the rest of the house.

09:16.834 --> 09:18.667
Why don't we peek in the
corner on that side and

09:18.800 --> 09:20.834
over there, and we'll see if
this wall continues and

09:20.967 --> 09:22.100
made a square.

09:22.233 --> 09:23.166
That sounds
like a good idea.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.967
I think we should
take some walls out.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.400
Ted and the boys have
uncovered a mystery.

09:27.533 --> 09:30.233
Why is an original log
cabin wall hidden

09:30.367 --> 09:32.400
inside the structure
of the farmhouse?

09:32.533 --> 09:36.133
And, how much of this
cabin is still standing?

09:36.266 --> 09:37.900
- Look at that.
- Right there, it is.

09:38.033 --> 09:41.734
- Yeah, see?
- Piece... See?

09:41.867 --> 09:44.233
- We are in the old log home.
- How the hell do you know?

09:44.367 --> 09:46.367
- Well, 'cause it goes this way.
- Oh, yeah!

09:46.500 --> 09:47.700
So, it goes this way.

09:47.834 --> 09:49.800
Yeah, I thought
it went that way.

09:49.934 --> 09:51.033
This is confusing.

09:51.166 --> 09:52.200
I wonder if
that's the end of it.

09:52.333 --> 09:53.734
You think you could pull
that apart and clean it up,

09:53.867 --> 09:55.667
and expose this
whole log structure?

09:55.800 --> 09:59.133
The brick has to come off
and then the wood beams,

09:59.266 --> 10:01.700
themself, hopefully we can
pluck 'em up one by one.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.633
Leave the drywall
behind, push it in,

10:03.767 --> 10:06.900
pluck the next one.
And it's all machine work.

10:07.033 --> 10:08.800
(laughs) I would love
to save this little...

10:08.934 --> 10:10.767
like, strip it.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.567
Maybe we expose
the whole thing,

10:12.700 --> 10:14.467
the new owners
might want it.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.633
Like, I would want it
as a heritage thing.

10:16.767 --> 10:18.834
- Yeah, to keep it on site?
- Yeah, exactly.

10:18.967 --> 10:20.233
Before this place
gets wrecked,

10:20.367 --> 10:21.934
I gotta give Ryan a
heads up we may have

10:22.066 --> 10:23.900
some serious history
on our hands.

10:24.033 --> 10:26.533
It is super cool and I don't
want this place to end up

10:26.667 --> 10:28.900
being torn apart
just to sell the logs.

10:29.033 --> 10:30.734
You guys keep
exposing walls.

10:30.867 --> 10:32.000
I'm gonna go
check the basement.

10:32.133 --> 10:33.834
We haven't even looked
in the basement yet.

- It's not a box.

11:36.266 --> 11:38.767
It's a steamer trunk.
On the ships in the old days,

11:38.900 --> 11:40.533
that's what they
brought their luggage on.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.767
So, this is a suitcase?

11:41.900 --> 11:43.100
Yeah, well, essentially,
it's a suitcase,

11:43.233 --> 11:44.533
but they didn't
have suitcases.

11:44.667 --> 11:45.900
- This was the deal, man.
- Look at the detail.

11:46.033 --> 11:48.100
You could put your whole life

11:48.233 --> 11:49.467
Can we just
open the damn trunk?

11:49.600 --> 11:52.433

- Open it!

- Yes.

a lot of monetary value,

items connect with people.

buyers for these small items.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.667
So, the first use of these
was in cigarette packages to

14:40.800 --> 14:43.033
stiffen them 'cause they
were soft packages and

14:43.166 --> 14:45.467
this was so the tobacco
would be preserved.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.000
Pre-World War II,
tobacco companies used

14:48.133 --> 14:49.834
to put these little
trading cards in.

like, actors and

14:51.800 --> 14:53.800

different athletes.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.200
Every time someone
finds these tobacco cards,

14:56.333 --> 14:58.934
they're gonna immediately
look for the Honus Wagner one.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.300

$3 million on auction.

touch base with on this.

$300 in this whole tin,

but right now,

17:02.266 --> 17:03.633

picks up stuff and thinks

17:03.767 --> 17:05.467
it's worth a lot of money,
but it's not.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.100

normally?

17:07.233 --> 17:08.367
125 bucks.

things can be.

going smooth in the future.

wear your sunglasses.

17:26.266 --> 17:28.000
- No?
- Never wear sunglasses.

Say you want 1500,
and he's at 1000.

we'll do a deal at 12.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.233

people off guard, almost.

these people here?

The first man to own
the property was

36:06.700 --> 36:10.400
James Fulton in 1803.

36:10.533 --> 36:14.867
I think this was built
probably in the 1840s.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.367
By the time we got to 1878,

36:17.500 --> 36:20.600
we have the Casey family,
Daniel Casey.

36:24.867 --> 36:27.333

the old log cabin

36:27.467 --> 36:29.367

It was quite common for
them to use the back part,

36:33.133 --> 36:35.400
the log cabin, as a kitchen,
and I believe they did

36:35.533 --> 36:37.700
do that in this
particular case.

36:37.834 --> 36:40.867
Neighbours gathered together
and raised this building,

36:41.000 --> 36:42.467
so it's the
folk who make it.

- Oh, they all helped?
- They all helped.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.800

head out and say,

36:46.934 --> 36:50.000
"I'm gonna raise the
house on Saturday."

36:50.133 --> 36:52.333
And the neighbours would
come early in the morning

36:52.467 --> 36:55.133

wee drop of whiskey.

42:15.734 --> 42:17.100
First off, I just
want to say, it's--

42:17.233 --> 42:18.734
I am so happy
you guys are keeping it.

42:18.867 --> 42:20.600
We are too. (laughs)

42:20.734 --> 42:22.467
We're very excited.
This is amazing.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.066
I brought you
back some stuff.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.300
Wow.

42:25.433 --> 42:28.467
First off, this board, this was
the 1870 property owner.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.066
- Wow.
- Daniel Casey.

42:30.200 --> 42:31.400
- Oh, my gosh!
- Wow!

42:31.533 --> 42:34.567
So that was inside the wall here
when they built the addition.

42:34.700 --> 42:36.367
It's amazing that's
still here, like, in pencil.

42:36.500 --> 42:38.066
- It's cool, eh?
- Yeah. Wow.

42:38.200 --> 42:40.233
That's that, and then,
this old tin was here.

42:40.367 --> 42:43.767
- Wow.
- Yeah, eh? (laughs)

42:43.900 --> 42:45.633
So, here's some history
on the place.

42:45.767 --> 42:48.533
This was built, I think,
in 1803. James Fulton.

42:48.667 --> 42:50.333
So, older than I
initially thought. Wow.

42:50.467 --> 42:52.367
Yeah. This picture we found,
but this is from--

42:52.500 --> 42:55.567
- Look at that frame.
- Yeah, it's a cool frame too.

42:55.700 --> 42:59.066
World War I. So, their names
are on the back.

42:59.200 --> 43:00.767
- And this was in here.
- Incredible.

43:00.900 --> 43:02.467
It's a silk, sort of
from the war time, too.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.967
(gasp) Oh my gosh.

43:05.100 --> 43:06.533
Just cool little things, right?
- Yeah!

43:06.667 --> 43:08.633
The rest of the
house was 1870, right.

43:08.767 --> 43:10.300
Remember the
upstairs and the front?

43:10.433 --> 43:11.367
Yeah.

43:11.500 --> 43:12.500
A lot of people would've
just came and smashed.

43:12.633 --> 43:14.400
- Yeah.
- We kind of take our time.

43:14.533 --> 43:15.900
Yeah, but not
Daniel Casey 'cause

43:16.033 --> 43:17.433
he built around the place.

43:17.567 --> 43:18.700
Yeah, it must have meant
something to him.

43:18.834 --> 43:19.900
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

43:20.033 --> 43:22.767
We purchased the property
hoping to build a family home

43:22.900 --> 43:24.667
and ended up
with this log cabin,

43:24.800 --> 43:25.800
which was pretty amazing.

43:25.934 --> 43:27.066
We weren't
expecting it at all.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.967
So, we'll be building up
there a bit away,

43:29.100 --> 43:31.300
so we thought, why not just
keep the log cabin where it is?

43:31.433 --> 43:32.567
They did an amazing job.

43:32.700 --> 43:34.800
I'm so surprised that they
were able to keep it intact

43:34.934 --> 43:36.166
as well as they did.

43:36.300 --> 43:38.200
We're so lucky that we had so
many great people on the team

43:38.333 --> 43:40.600
that did so much work
in looking into the history

43:40.734 --> 43:43.033
of the area and actually
inspired us as well to do

43:43.166 --> 43:45.367
our own sort of research and
become more connected to

43:45.500 --> 43:47.400
the land and the
community as well.

43:47.533 --> 43:48.500
- Thanks, guys.
- Thanks so much, Ted.

43:48.633 --> 43:49.667
Thank you so
much for coming.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.266
And thanks for keeping it.
I love it.

43:51.400 --> 43:53.066
- Absolutely.
- Excellent. See you guys.

43:53.200 --> 43:54.433
- Take care.
- You too.

43:54.567 --> 43:56.567
The favourite part of my
job is giving new life to

43:56.700 --> 43:59.734
something and this is the
ultimate version of that.
