21:26.850 --> 21:29.940
YOU KNOW, I--I KEPT
MY MOUTH SHUT SO
THAT YOU COULD BE FREE.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.899
BUT...

21:31.899 --> 21:33.944
NOW YOU'RE HERE
AND--AND HE'S HERE,

21:33.944 --> 21:36.295
AND I CAN'T NOT SAY
MY PIECE,

21:36.295 --> 21:38.297
WHICH IS JUST...

21:41.300 --> 21:45.565
I WISH YOU'D
BE FREE WITH ME.

21:45.565 --> 21:47.349
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

21:48.307 --> 21:50.787
UH, THAT'S CLAUDIA.

21:50.787 --> 21:52.963
UM, I'M SORRY. HOLD ON.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.491
JUSTIN.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.928
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

22:00.928 --> 22:03.060
NO. NO,
NO, IT'S FINE.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.714
I WAS...

22:06.281 --> 22:08.327
I WAS--I WAS
JUST LEAVING.

22:09.589 --> 22:10.720
EXCUSE ME.

22:22.689 --> 22:23.777
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.561
YEAH, I KNOW,
I KNOW, I KNOW.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.737
YOU DECIDED TO GET
MARRIED TOMORROW.

22:27.737 --> 22:30.392
YOU WANT IT THAT BADLY,
BUT THEN YOU CALL ME?

22:30.392 --> 22:31.698
I MEAN, THAT
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.743
SO, SINCE WHEN HAS IT
EVER MADE SENSE?

22:33.743 --> 22:34.875
I MEAN, GETTING MARRIED,
YOU KNOW?

22:34.875 --> 22:36.572
HOW CAN 2 PEOPLE
POSSIBLY KNOW

22:36.572 --> 22:38.748
IF SOMETHING
THAT FEELS RIGHT TODAY

22:38.748 --> 22:39.880
IS GONNA FEEL RIGHT
TOMORROW?

22:39.880 --> 22:41.360
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.883
THAT'S WHAT
MAKES IT ROMANTIC.

22:42.883 --> 22:44.754
IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH.

22:44.754 --> 22:47.148
IT'S BELIEVING
THAT WE CAN MAKE
SOMETHING TOGETHER

22:47.148 --> 22:49.455
THAT'S BETTER THAN
WHAT WE CAN MAKE ALONE.

22:49.455 --> 22:52.109
AND LAURA AND ME--
I MEAN, WE LOVE
EACH OTHER,

22:52.109 --> 22:55.025
AND WE'RE GONNA
TAKE THE LEAP.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.549
OK, SO THEN,
WHAT ABOUT ME?

22:56.549 --> 22:58.202
WHY AM I HERE?

23:01.510 --> 23:04.208
[GROANS]
WELL, THAT'S THE...

23:04.208 --> 23:09.910
THE PART THAT, UH,
I WISH MADE MORE SENSE.

23:19.006 --> 23:22.749
LOOK...

23:22.749 --> 23:24.577
I WANT TO DO THIS.

23:24.577 --> 23:25.882
I WANT TO GET MARRIED.

23:25.882 --> 23:28.015
WELL, THEN, JUSTIN,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU
WANT, THEN--

23:28.015 --> 23:29.451
JULIA...

23:33.063 --> 23:34.543
I LOVE YOU.

23:36.589 --> 23:39.461
[SIGHS] I ALWAYS HAVE,

23:39.461 --> 23:44.118
AND LAURA, UM,

23:44.118 --> 23:48.905
SHE WANTS TO GET MARRIED
AND I LOVE HER, TOO.

23:48.905 --> 23:50.864
BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM
IS THAT

23:50.864 --> 23:54.215
IF I'M GONNA
TAKE THIS LEAP,

23:54.215 --> 23:57.871
I KEEP ASKING MYSELF
[SIGHS]

23:57.871 --> 24:00.569
IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE US?

24:00.569 --> 24:06.619
SHOULD I BE TAKING
THIS LEAP WITH YOU?

24:06.619 --> 24:10.449
SO I WROTE YOU
BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL.

24:10.449 --> 24:14.670
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
YOU SAID ALL THAT
STUFF AND...

24:14.670 --> 24:16.803
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

24:21.024 --> 24:22.983
I DON'T KNOW.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.250
WELL, IT'S A HARD QUESTION,
I REALIZE THAT, BUT, UH--

24:29.250 --> 24:31.905
JUSTIN, HOW CAN I
POSSIBLY KNOW?

24:36.300 --> 24:37.780
RIGHT.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.403
OK.

25:14.034 --> 25:16.210
RECEIPTS
ARE ALL THERE.

25:16.210 --> 25:17.951

BALANCES OUT.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.692
THANKS.

25:19.692 --> 25:22.042
ANY WORD
ON WHEN BAILEY'S
COMING BACK?

25:22.042 --> 25:24.000
NOT SOON ENOUGH.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.480
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.613
THEN LET ME
DO IT.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.965
JOE, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I GOT IT COVERED.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.978
HOW LONG IS THIS
GONNA GO ON?

25:44.978 --> 25:47.937
WELL, I FIGURE
BAILEY JUST NEEDS
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME--

25:47.937 --> 25:50.157
NO, I MEAN
YOU AND ME. THIS.

25:50.157 --> 25:53.943
HOW LONG IS THIS
NOT TRUSTING ME
GONNA GO ON?

25:59.819 --> 26:01.472
I DON'T KNOW, JOE.

26:01.472 --> 26:04.693
I'VE PRETTY MUCH DONE
EVERYTHING I CAN DO
TO PROVE MYSELF TO YOU.

26:04.693 --> 26:07.566
I SOLD MY CONDO,
I SOLD MY CAR,

26:07.566 --> 26:10.003
EVERYTHING
I HAVE OF VALUE.

26:10.003 --> 26:13.484
UM, I'M JUST SHY
OF PAYING BACK
WHAT I BORROWED.

26:13.484 --> 26:16.183
SEE, THAT'S JUST IT,
JOEY. YOU DIDN'T--
YOU DIDN'T BORROW.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.751
WHAT YOU DID IS CALLED
SOMETHING ELSE.

26:18.751 --> 26:21.536
I MADE A MISTAKE,
CHARLIE.

26:21.536 --> 26:24.452
I MEAN, I SEEM TO
REMEMBER YOU MAKING
ONE OR 2 MIS--

26:24.452 --> 26:26.106
JOE, THIS IS
NOT ABOUT ME.

26:26.106 --> 26:27.281
THAT'S RIGHT.

26:27.281 --> 26:29.544
IT'S ABOUT US.
YOU AND ME.

26:29.544 --> 26:32.678
IT'S ABOUT
HOW 20 YEARS
OF KNOWING ME

26:32.678 --> 26:34.244
SEEMS TO MEAN
NOTHING TO YOU.

26:34.244 --> 26:36.769
NOTHING?

26:36.769 --> 26:39.946
JOE, IT MEANS
EVERYTHING.

26:39.946 --> 26:43.079
A--A STRANGER
WALKS IN HERE AND
DOES WHAT YOU DID,

26:43.079 --> 26:47.257
AND I'M--I'M PISSED OFF,
I'M MAD, BUT THAT'S IT.

26:47.257 --> 26:50.130
[SIGHS] BUT YOU...

26:50.130 --> 26:52.741
20 YEARS, AND
THEN YOU DO THIS.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.264
I'M STILL ME,
CHAR--

26:54.264 --> 26:56.745
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW THAT, JOE?

27:02.969 --> 27:04.884
OK.

27:07.103 --> 27:08.670
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:08.670 --> 27:11.804
IF THIS IS
HOW IT IS,

27:11.804 --> 27:16.025
THEN MAYBE THERE'S
NO POINT IN ME
STICKING AROUND.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.208
I'LL CLEAR OUT
MY STUFF TOMORROW.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.839
HEY.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.579
HOW ARE YOU?

27:48.579 --> 27:50.886
OH, HELLO.

27:52.105 --> 27:53.106
JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE

27:53.106 --> 27:54.542
THEY DIDN'T
LOBOTOMIZE YOU.

27:54.542 --> 27:57.240
[LAUGHS] GOD,
I WISH THEY WOULD.

28:00.417 --> 28:03.116
WOULD YOU MIND NOT
STARING AT ME LIKE THAT?

28:03.116 --> 28:04.552
I'M SORRY,
I'M JUST--

28:04.552 --> 28:06.554
I'M FINE.

28:06.554 --> 28:08.164
RIGHT.

28:08.164 --> 28:10.427
OK.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.212
ANYWAY.

28:12.212 --> 28:15.911
LOOK, THANKS.

28:15.911 --> 28:18.305
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU SAVED ME
FROM ANYTHING.

28:18.305 --> 28:19.959
EVEN IF I GOT
THOSE PILLS DOWN,

28:19.959 --> 28:21.395
THEY JUST WOULD'VE
PUMPED MY STOMACH.

28:21.395 --> 28:24.703
WELL, THEN,
WHY DID YOU BOTHER
DOING IT?

28:24.703 --> 28:27.009
THAT'S FUNNY YOU
HAVE TO ASK ME THAT.

28:27.009 --> 28:28.010
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

28:28.010 --> 28:30.317
YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO LEAVE HERE, EITHER.

28:30.317 --> 28:33.233
I JUST WANT
TO FIGURE OUT

28:33.233 --> 28:34.625
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH ME.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.323
REALLY?

28:36.323 --> 28:39.630
LET ME SAVE YOU
SOME THERAPY BILLS.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.372
PULL UP A COUCH.

28:48.683 --> 28:52.034
YOU'RE INTO
THE CAVALRY RUSH,
SAME AS ME.

28:52.034 --> 28:53.775
CAVALRY?

28:53.775 --> 28:54.776
SURE.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.038
YOU LOVE
A GOOD CRISIS.

28:56.038 --> 28:59.215
REALLY GETS
THE BLOOD GOING.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.739
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

29:00.739 --> 29:02.349
WE'VE ALL
HEARD YOUR STORY.

29:02.349 --> 29:05.091
THOSE ORPHANS
ALL PULLING TOGETHER.

29:05.091 --> 29:09.835
LOOK, I DON'T DO
WHAT YOU DID.

29:09.835 --> 29:12.359
I DON'T GET MYSELF
INTO TROUBLE

29:12.359 --> 29:14.013
SO PEOPLE HAVE
TO COME RUSHING
TO MY RESCUE.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.885
DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S THE SAME DISEASE.

29:16.885 --> 29:21.760
SOME OF US GET OFF
ON NEEDING A 911 RESCUE.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.675
AND SOME OF US GET OFF
ON GIVING IT.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.161
TV: TRADE SECRETS WITH ME,
MR. PENDLETON.

29:32.161 --> 29:33.467
OK WITH ME.
HERE WE ARE.

29:46.219 --> 29:47.394
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

29:47.394 --> 29:50.005
TODD? TODD,
IT'S CLAUDIA.
YOU DECENT?

29:50.005 --> 29:51.180
OH, YOU'RE HERE.

29:51.180 --> 29:53.052
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

29:53.052 --> 29:55.097
I--I CAN EXPLAIN
THIS.

29:55.097 --> 29:58.318
NO, SEE, THE REMOTE,
IT'S--THE REMOTE'S
BROKEN, AND--

29:58.318 --> 30:00.059
NO. FIRST WITH
THE DANCING GIRLS,

30:00.059 --> 30:01.538
AND NOW THE PORNO?

30:01.538 --> 30:04.672
NO, THE PORNO,
IT'S--

30:04.672 --> 30:06.021
IT'S AN ACCIDENT,
ALL RIGHT?

30:06.021 --> 30:07.893
THE GIRLS DOWNSTAIRS,
I MEAN, THAT WAS--

30:07.893 --> 30:10.156
I JUST COULDN'T
HELP BUT NOTICE.
I MEAN--

30:10.156 --> 30:13.376
HELLO? WHY CAN'T YOU
NOTICE ME?

30:13.376 --> 30:15.857
WHAT?

30:15.857 --> 30:17.076
TODD, YOU KISSED ME.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.120
I MEAN, YOU KISSED ME.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.861
MAYBE IT WAS
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO,

30:19.861 --> 30:22.429
BUT--I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
I TURNED INTO YOUR SISTER
OR SOMETHING.

30:22.429 --> 30:24.039
I MEAN, DO YOU
WANT ME TO, YOU KNOW,

30:24.039 --> 30:27.086
WEAR FEATHERS AND--
AND SPARKLY THINGS,

30:27.086 --> 30:29.305
OR--OR THIS SHORT
CHEERLEADER SKIRT?

30:29.305 --> 30:32.091
I MEAN, TELL ME,
WHAT'S SUDDENLY
WRONG WITH ME?

30:32.091 --> 30:35.181
WAIT, YOU THINK THAT
I'M NOT INTERESTED?

30:35.181 --> 30:36.486
WELL, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO THINK?

30:36.486 --> 30:37.748
YOU'RE LIKE THE KING
OF MIXED SIGNALS.

30:37.748 --> 30:40.186
ME? MIXED SIGNALS?

30:40.186 --> 30:42.405
ME, ME? THE ONE
WHO IS KILLING
HIMSELF

30:42.405 --> 30:43.406
NOT TO BE A PIG.

30:43.406 --> 30:44.581
WHY?

30:44.581 --> 30:46.845
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THIS PAST.

30:46.845 --> 30:47.933
I MEAN, YOU TELL ME
THE REASON

30:47.933 --> 30:49.151
YOU'RE SCARED TO GET
INTO A RELATIONSHIP

30:49.151 --> 30:51.806
IS--IS BECAUSE OF
WHAT'S-HIS-NAME?
DEREK.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.764
I MEAN, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO THINK?

30:53.764 --> 30:55.505
EVERY TIME I WANT
TO TOUCH YOU,
I FEEL LIKE,

30:55.505 --> 30:56.942
YOU KNOW,
WHAT IF SHE JUST
WANTS TO BE FRIENDS

30:56.942 --> 30:58.987
OR AM I FORCING
MYSELF ON HER?

30:58.987 --> 31:01.685
AM I MAKING THE SAME
WRONG ASSUMPTIONS
THAT HE DID?

31:01.685 --> 31:04.427
YOU ACTUALLY--

31:04.427 --> 31:06.081
THAT'S WHAT YOU
THOUGHT?

31:06.081 --> 31:07.822
I'VE BEEN GOING INSANE.

31:07.822 --> 31:10.564
I MEAN, WE'RE TOGETHER LIKE
THOUSANDS OF HOURS A DAY,

31:10.564 --> 31:13.828
AND YOU SIT THERE AND
SMILING AND LAUGHING
AND BREATHING

31:13.828 --> 31:16.178
AND JUST SMELLING
SO UNBELIEVABLY INCREDIBLE.

31:16.178 --> 31:18.311
TODD.
AND WE'RE IN
THIS HOTEL ROOM,

31:18.311 --> 31:19.660
IN SIN CITY,

31:19.660 --> 31:21.662
AND IF I DON'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT,

31:21.662 --> 31:23.403
I'M SCARED
THAT I'M JUST GONNA--

31:30.323 --> 31:31.977
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

31:36.329 --> 31:37.808
OK?

31:42.291 --> 31:45.642
MARRIAGE IS
A SACRED COMMITMENT

31:45.642 --> 31:48.210
NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
OR WHIMSICALLY.

31:48.210 --> 31:52.345
IT'S AN OATH OF LOVE
YOU BOTH MAKE
TO EACH OTHER,

31:52.345 --> 31:56.827
TO THIS CONGREGATION,
AND TO GOD.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.133
BUT BEFORE WE PROCEED,

31:58.133 --> 31:59.874
I MUST ASK IF THERE
IS ANYONE PRESENT

31:59.874 --> 32:01.920
WHO OBJECTS
TO THIS UNION,

32:01.920 --> 32:05.749
LET THEM SPEAK NOW OR
FOREVER HOLD THEIR PEACE.

32:13.018 --> 32:16.064
VERY WELL, THEN.
THE RINGS, PLEASE.

32:17.326 --> 32:18.849
JUSTIN...

32:18.849 --> 32:23.593
DO YOU PROMISE
TO LOVE, HONOR,
AND CHERISH LAURA

32:23.593 --> 32:27.380
FOR AS LONG AS
YOU BOTH SHALL LIVE?

32:27.380 --> 32:28.729
I DO.

32:37.042 --> 32:38.913
WE'RE BOOKING
PLENTY OF SEATINGS,

32:38.913 --> 32:43.874
BUT, UH, JOE
CHANGED THE MENU,

32:43.874 --> 32:45.093
UH, TO SIMPLER DISHES,

32:45.093 --> 32:47.922
STUFF THAT'S CHEAPER.
WHICH MEANS
LESS REVENUE.

32:47.922 --> 32:48.923
CHARLIE.

32:48.923 --> 32:50.011
I THINK THAT'S A LOT
OF THE PROBLEM.

32:50.011 --> 32:52.057
IF WE UPGRADE
THE MENU,
AND INCREASE--

32:52.057 --> 32:55.582
CHARLIE, I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR THIS,
OK? PLEASE.

32:55.582 --> 32:58.759
PLEASE, JUST DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT
OVER THERE.

32:58.759 --> 33:00.108
I DON'T CARE
ANYMORE, OK?

33:00.108 --> 33:02.589
LOOK, I--I KNOW
THIS PROBABLY
DOESN'T

33:02.589 --> 33:03.938
SEEM THAT IMPORTANT
TO YOU RIGHT NOW--

33:03.938 --> 33:05.766
NO, IT'S JUST
NOT RIGHT NOW.

33:05.766 --> 33:08.856
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT EVER DID, CHARLIE.

33:10.771 --> 33:12.816
PEOPLE THINK THAT
I WAS GOOD AT THAT JOB,

33:12.816 --> 33:14.731
SO THAT I MUST
HAVE LOVED DOING IT.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.211
BAILEY, WHY ARE YOU
SUDDENLY GOING ON--

33:16.211 --> 33:19.910
YOU AND
JULIA AND CLAUD...

33:19.910 --> 33:22.609
YOU ALL HAVE THIS STUFF
THAT YOU GUYS DO

33:22.609 --> 33:25.394
BECAUSE--BECAUSE THERE'S
SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU

33:25.394 --> 33:27.353
THAT WON'T LET YOU DO
ANYTHING ELSE.

33:27.353 --> 33:31.487
BUT WHAT'S THAT FOR ME?

33:31.487 --> 33:33.968
WHAT DO I HAVE
THAT I'M GREAT AT?

33:34.838 --> 33:37.319
BAILEY. [LAUGHS]

33:37.319 --> 33:39.756
PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING
