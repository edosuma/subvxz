BUT I'M NOT
FOLLOWING YOU.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.028
I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK, OK?

32:39.028 --> 32:41.460
HEY, YOU NEED
THE VESSEL.

32:42.131 --> 32:44.433
HA HA HA!

32:44.433 --> 32:46.365
HA HA HA!

32:46.365 --> 32:50.299
NO. I'M NOT
GONNA NEED THAT.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.271
HA HA HA!

32:52.271 --> 32:54.473
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S GONNA DO?

32:54.473 --> 32:57.046
HA HA HA!

32:59.548 --> 33:02.051
[THUNDER]

33:02.051 --> 33:04.253
COMING OUT!

33:18.727 --> 33:21.330
[THUNDER]

33:32.481 --> 33:35.244
ARTHUR FERREY!

33:54.463 --> 33:57.736
YOU'RE NOT
SENDING ME BACK!

33:57.736 --> 34:01.510
YOU CAN'T KEEP KILLING
INNOCENT PEOPLE!

34:01.510 --> 34:04.143
THEY TOOK AWAY MY NAME.

34:04.143 --> 34:07.616
THEY TOOK AWAY EVERY
GOOD THING I EVER DID.

34:07.616 --> 34:11.280
NO, THEY DIDN'T.
YOU DID IT TO YOURSELF.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.752
YOU DESTROYED
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

34:13.752 --> 34:17.256
EVERYONE WILL PAY,

34:17.256 --> 34:21.460
AND YOU
CAN'T STOP ME.

34:27.496 --> 34:29.298
WHAT'S THAT?

34:29.298 --> 34:33.142
I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED
A LIGHTNING ROD.

34:33.142 --> 34:34.643
OH...

34:38.447 --> 34:40.849
DAH!
AAGH!

34:40.849 --> 34:44.082
OH, GOD...

34:48.687 --> 34:52.361
I DID IT.

34:52.361 --> 34:55.394
I DID IT. I DID IT.

34:58.597 --> 35:02.131
WHOO!

35:07.876 --> 35:10.379
WELL, HELLO.
WE MEET AGAIN, GLADYS.

35:10.379 --> 35:13.642
PLACE THE VESSEL
ON THE MAT.

35:13.642 --> 35:16.415
WHAT'S IT LIKE WORKING
IN THE PORTAL TO HELL, HUH?

35:16.415 --> 35:19.348
MUST BE A LOT
OF WACK JOBS,
A LOT OF WEIRDOS.

35:19.348 --> 35:21.590
THIS ISN'T
THE ENTIRE
VESSEL.

35:21.590 --> 35:23.892
OH, YES.
OH, RIGHT.

35:23.892 --> 35:25.454
GOT SOME VESSEL
IN THE OLD POCKETS.

35:25.454 --> 35:28.527
THE FACT THAT
YOU TWO HAVEN'T
BEEN KILLED YET

35:28.527 --> 35:30.529
ASTONISHES ME.

35:30.529 --> 35:33.462
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THANKS, GLADYS.

35:33.462 --> 35:36.405
YEAH, YEAH.
WHOA, WHOA.

35:36.405 --> 35:39.838
THAT'S MINE.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.313
OHH...

35:44.313 --> 35:45.143
PHEW...

35:45.143 --> 35:46.515
Kyle: YOU GOT TO
BE KIDDING ME.

35:46.515 --> 35:47.376
HERE WE GO.

35:47.376 --> 35:48.547
YOU WRECKED
THE NEW CAR ALREADY?

35:48.547 --> 35:50.679
IT'S NOT WRECKED,
JUST THE WINDOW.

35:50.679 --> 35:52.351
I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS.

35:52.351 --> 35:53.222
OK. WHAT IS WRONG?

35:53.222 --> 35:54.152
MOM, I JUST
WANT YOU TO KNOW

35:54.152 --> 35:56.385
I WOULD NEVER
TREAT A CAR
THE WAY SAM DOES.

35:56.385 --> 35:59.458
I WOULD NEVER
JUST THROW AWAY SUCH
A GENEROUS GIFT,

35:59.458 --> 36:02.531
YOU KNOW,
IF I SHOULD BE
SO LUCKY TO GET ONE.

36:02.531 --> 36:04.393
THANK YOU, KYLE.
THAT'S VERY NICE.

36:04.393 --> 36:05.494
I'M SURE IF YOU
ASK SAM NICELY,

36:05.494 --> 36:08.537
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
HE'D BE HAPPY
TO GIVE YOU A RIDE.

36:08.537 --> 36:11.270
IF YOU SAY
PLEASE.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.571
SAY PRETTY PLEASE.

36:12.571 --> 36:15.604
YOU SHOULD TRY NOT TO TORTURE
YOUR BROTHER.

36:15.604 --> 36:19.778
YEAH. NO. I--

36:19.778 --> 36:23.482
MOM, LOOK. I--

36:23.482 --> 36:25.654
I'VE BEEN WORKING
FOR THE DEVIL

36:25.654 --> 36:28.257
AS A BOUNTY HUNTER
FOR SOULS
THAT GET OUT OF HELL,

36:28.257 --> 36:31.660
AND I LIED TO YOU BECAUSE
I THOUGHT THAT THAT'S
WHAT YOU'D WANT TO HEAR,

36:31.660 --> 36:36.695
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

36:38.327 --> 36:40.369
HUH.

36:40.369 --> 36:42.471
SAM, I JUST WANTED
TO HEAR THE TRUTH.

36:42.471 --> 36:45.434
THAT'S IT.
THANK YOU
FOR TELLING ME.

36:45.434 --> 36:45.774
OK.

36:45.774 --> 36:48.807
I THINK WE'VE ALL
LIVED WITH THIS SECRET
FOR FAR TOO LONG,

36:48.807 --> 36:50.709
AND THAT'S PROBABLY
THE GOOD THAT'S GOING

36:50.709 --> 36:54.513
TO COME OUT OF
THIS WHOLE THING--
NO MORE SECRETS.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.715
NO MORE SECRETS.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.418
EXCEPT LET'S NOT
TELL YOUR BROTHER.

36:59.418 --> 37:01.520
DEFINITELY.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.753
Ted: I AM SO VERY, VERY
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU, SAM.

37:04.753 --> 37:05.854
I GAVE YOU RESPONSIBILITY.

37:05.854 --> 37:10.259
I GAVE YOU A TASK,
AND THIS IS HOW YOU
REPAY MY CONFIDENCE?

37:10.259 --> 37:12.331
I'M SORRY.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.463
SO, CAN YOU OFFER ME
A PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION

37:14.463 --> 37:18.437
AS TO WHY
THE STORE LOOKS LIKE
A BOMB WENT OFF?

37:18.437 --> 37:21.310
NOT REALLY.

37:21.310 --> 37:23.241
SO, YOU'LL STAND BY
BERT WYSOCKI'S ASSERTION

37:23.241 --> 37:26.375
THAT YOU WERE ATTACKED
BY NINJAS LAST NIGHT.

37:26.375 --> 37:28.577
UM...

37:28.577 --> 37:31.550
I THINK SOMETIMES...

37:31.550 --> 37:34.653
BERT HAS REALLY VIVID DREAMS
WHEN HE'S AWAKE,

37:34.653 --> 37:36.885
AND I THINK THAT
THAT WAS PROBABLY--

37:36.885 --> 37:40.629
SAM, THE SECRET
TO SUCCESS

37:40.629 --> 37:44.663
IS TO BE READY
WHEN AN OPPORTUNITY
PRESENTS ITSELF.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.765
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THAT SAYS RIGHT--

37:46.765 --> 37:51.400
WHAT I'M TRYING TO
SAY IS THAT YOU'VE
REACHED A NEW LOW.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.942
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO ABOUT THAT?

37:53.942 --> 37:56.675
FIRE ME.
OR I COULD
TEACH YOU...

37:56.675 --> 37:59.578
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT I INTEND TO DO.

37:59.578 --> 38:02.481
LITTLE PERSPIRATION
MIGHT DO YOU
SOME GOOD,

38:02.481 --> 38:03.382
SOME DIRT
UNDER THE NAILS,

38:03.382 --> 38:08.487
YOU'RE OFF THE MIDNIGHT
SHIFT ONTO GARBAGE DUTY.

38:08.487 --> 38:11.590
OK.
YEP.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.365
[SIGHS]

38:16.365 --> 38:18.427
OHH...

38:25.534 --> 38:28.407
AH...

38:28.407 --> 38:30.539
YOU MISSED
A CANDY WRAPPER.

38:30.539 --> 38:31.680
MM-HMM.
[SIGHS]

38:31.680 --> 38:35.784
OH, COME ON, SAMMY.
TURN THAT FROWN UPSIDE DOWN.

38:35.784 --> 38:39.017
YOU'RE A HERO, MAN.
YOU PUT A SOUL IN HELL.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.088
HOW DOES THAT FEEL, HUH?

38:40.088 --> 38:42.491
THAT'S PURE, UNADULTERATED
SATISFACTION.

38:42.491 --> 38:45.394
ALL THE MONEY AND TAIL
IN THE WORLD CAN'T COMPARE.

38:45.394 --> 38:47.396
WHAT'S SO SATISFYING
ABOUT IT?

38:47.396 --> 38:49.398
I'M BANISHED
TO GARBAGE DUTY,

38:49.398 --> 38:50.759
AND I'VE GOT
TWO JOBS I HATE.

38:50.759 --> 38:55.504
WELL, TRUTH IS, I'VE
ALREADY DONE YOU A SOLID.

38:55.504 --> 38:57.466
I'VE BEEN MEDDLING
WITH TED'S SCHEDULE,

38:57.466 --> 38:59.868
AND I GOT YOU
OFF THE GARBAGE DUTY.

38:59.868 --> 39:02.471
HAPPY?
GARDEN CENTER.
GREAT.

39:02.471 --> 39:05.514
THANKS TO YOU,
I GET TO SHOVEL MANURE
FOR THE NEXT 10 HOURS.

39:05.514 --> 39:08.417
OH, THAT'S
THE BITTER WIT I LOVE.

39:08.417 --> 39:12.020
SOCK IT TO ME, SAMMY.
HA HA HA!

39:20.859 --> 39:23.361
UGH!

39:32.841 --> 39:35.604
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

39:35.604 --> 39:38.847
OH, I GOT IN TROUBLE.

39:38.847 --> 39:40.709
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:40.709 --> 39:43.752
ME AND TED GOT
INTO AN ARGUMENT,

39:43.752 --> 39:45.714
AND I
ALLEGEDLY HIT HIM

39:45.714 --> 39:49.488
IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD
WITH A PINT
OF LATEX PAINT.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.959
ANDI...

39:50.959 --> 39:52.491
WHAT? ALLEGEDLY.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.722
THERE WERE
NO WITNESSES.

39:53.722 --> 39:57.165
WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
HE DIDN'T PRESS CHARGES.

39:57.165 --> 39:58.427
YEAH. WELL...

39:58.427 --> 40:00.168
AT LEAST WE'RE IN HELL
TOGETHER, RIGHT?

40:00.168 --> 40:04.433
WHAT?
HELL, YOU KNOW?
THIS SUCKS?

40:04.433 --> 40:07.035
