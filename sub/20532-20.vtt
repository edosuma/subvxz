00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.310 --> 00:12.311
<i> ¶ I was a girl in the village</i>
<i> Doing all right ¶</i>

00:12.313 --> 00:14.813
<i> ¶ Then I became a princess</i>
<i> Overnight ¶</i>

00:14.815 --> 00:17.383
<i> ¶ Now I gotta figure out</i>
<i> How to do it right ¶</i>

00:17.385 --> 00:19.218
<i> ¶ So much to learn and see ¶</i>

00:19.220 --> 00:22.354
<i> ¶ Up in the castle</i>
<i> With my new family ¶</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:25.124
<i> ¶ In a school</i>
<i> That's just for royalty ¶</i>

00:25.126 --> 00:29.328
<i> ¶ A whole enchanted world</i>
<i> Is waiting for me ¶</i>

00:29.330 --> 00:32.965
-¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
-¶ Sofia the First ¶

00:32.967 --> 00:36.668
<i> ¶ I'm finding out</i>
<i> What being royal's all about ¶</i>

00:36.670 --> 00:38.070
<i> ¶ Sofia the First ¶</i>

00:38.072 --> 00:39.405
<i> ¶ Making my way ¶</i>

00:39.407 --> 00:41.707
<i> ¶ It's an adventure every day ¶</i>

00:41.709 --> 00:43.909
<i> -¶ Sofia ¶</i>
<i> -¶ It's gonna be my time ¶</i>

00:43.911 --> 00:46.879
<i> -¶ Sofia</i>
<i> -¶ To show them all that I'm ¶</i>

00:46.881 --> 00:51.550
<i> ¶ Sofia the First ¶</i>

01:01.162 --> 01:04.496
[sighs] Great training
session today, Sofia.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.831
Know what it's time for now?

01:05.833 --> 01:07.433
More Enchantlet drills?

01:07.435 --> 01:09.868
Nope. Tea at my place!

01:09.870 --> 01:12.037
You're inviting me for tea?

01:12.039 --> 01:14.106
Wow Chrysta, you really
have changed

01:14.108 --> 01:16.041
since that whole
Wassailia thing.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.677
And everybody likes
the new, friendlier
me a lot better.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.612
Hey fairies!
How's it glowin'?

01:21.916 --> 01:22.981
[screams]

01:25.052 --> 01:27.286
Well, almost everybody.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.954
What was that all about?

01:28.956 --> 01:31.457
Oh, I've never really fit in
with the other fairies.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.559
Guess I'm a little too
rough around the edges.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.727
Most of 'em don't want
anything to do with me.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.363
Well, there's at least
one who does...

01:38.365 --> 01:40.365
[snoring]

01:40.367 --> 01:41.366
Snoozle?

01:41.368 --> 01:42.601
Ahh! Ooh!

01:42.603 --> 01:45.204
Chrysta! Chrysta the Protector,

01:45.206 --> 01:46.705
I need you!

01:46.707 --> 01:50.142
Oh, I have dreamed
the most terrible dream.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.644
You must hear my warning
immediate--

01:52.646 --> 01:55.280
-[clock chime]
-[snoring]

01:55.282 --> 01:57.316
[snoring]

01:57.318 --> 01:58.617
Is he okay?

01:58.619 --> 02:01.286
Oh, sure. Snoozle
is a Dream Fairy.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.155
Their dreams
can tell the future.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.389
They always
come true.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.624
Wow. Always?

02:05.626 --> 02:06.992
[grunts] I just dreamed
that you should

02:06.994 --> 02:08.794
take a step
to your left. Quickly!

02:09.930 --> 02:11.330
Whoa!

02:11.332 --> 02:13.665
Thanks for catching
my little girl!

02:13.667 --> 02:15.567
She's still getting
the hang of her wings.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.603
-Come along, Daisy.
-[cooing]

02:17.605 --> 02:20.005
I guess your dreams
always do come true.

02:20.007 --> 02:23.842
Yes. They're just
hard to understand sometimes.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.811
So? What did you dream?

02:25.813 --> 02:28.080
Oh! Someone
is planning to steal

02:28.082 --> 02:30.682
all the magic
from the Pixie Cup!

02:30.684 --> 02:32.251
What's the Pixie Cup?

02:32.253 --> 02:35.787
It's a magic blossom
that only opens once a year.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.257
Young fairies must pass a test

02:38.259 --> 02:42.327
in order to dip their wands
in the Pixie Cup when it opens,

02:42.329 --> 02:45.797
and from it,
receive their magic powers.

02:45.799 --> 02:49.268
But if someone steals
all it's magic for themselves,

02:49.270 --> 02:52.804
no fairy will ever
get a magic wand again!

02:52.806 --> 02:55.207
And all the beautiful, magical

02:55.209 --> 02:58.477
things we do will fade away...

02:58.479 --> 02:59.478
-We have to stop this!
-[clock chime]

02:59.480 --> 03:01.313
[snoring]

03:01.315 --> 03:03.348
Snoozle, who's the thief?

03:03.350 --> 03:04.650
I didn't see a face.

03:04.652 --> 03:08.320
But I did
dream of blue butter.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.388
Blue butter?

03:09.390 --> 03:11.156
Yes. Like I said,

03:11.158 --> 03:13.492
dreams are hard to understand.

03:13.494 --> 03:17.629
But look for blue butter
and you'll find your thief.

03:17.631 --> 03:21.900
Now, I'm off for a nap.
All this dreaming is exhaust--

03:21.902 --> 03:23.969
-[clock chime]
-[snoring]

03:27.007 --> 03:30.309
If we're gonna protect
the Pixie Cup's magic
from a thief,

03:30.311 --> 03:33.845
we need to be there
when the blossom opens.
Which is today.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.248
But only fairies taking
the Pixie Cup Test

03:36.250 --> 03:38.083
are allowed
in the Fairy Forest.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.885
Why don't we pretend
to be two fairies

03:39.887 --> 03:41.220
earning their magic wands?

03:41.222 --> 03:43.088
You mean
go undercover?

03:43.090 --> 03:44.756
How? You're not
even a fairy.

03:44.758 --> 03:45.991
Not yet.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.594
My amulet lets me
turn into a mermaid.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.095
So, maybe...

03:50.097 --> 03:53.098
I wish I was a fairy!

03:55.903 --> 03:57.903
[gasp] It worked!

03:57.905 --> 03:59.538
I've got wings
and everything!

03:59.540 --> 04:01.073
Let's go undercover.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.442
We'll pass that test,
get close to the Pixie Cup,

04:03.444 --> 04:05.944
and stop whoever
is going to steal its magic!

04:07.381 --> 04:09.414
Wait. Sofia,

04:09.416 --> 04:11.383
I have to tell you something.

04:11.385 --> 04:14.686
I already took
the Pixie Cup Test once...

04:14.688 --> 04:15.721
and failed.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.623
You never got
your fairy wand?

04:17.625 --> 04:20.092
But how could you
fail the test?

04:20.094 --> 04:22.861
You're so strong and brave.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.697
None of that matters
when you're a fairy.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.699
It's not the fairy way.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.801
[giggling]

04:29.803 --> 04:32.771
<i> ¶ Growing up</i>
<i> On the Fairy Isle ¶</i>

04:32.773 --> 04:37.276
<i> ¶ They say you're s'posed to</i>
<i>Flit around all day and smile ¶</i>

04:37.278 --> 04:40.879
<i> ¶ But there were tougher games</i>
<i> I wanted to play ¶</i>

04:40.881 --> 04:43.548
<i> ¶ And that's not</i>
<i> The fairy way ¶</i>

04:43.550 --> 04:47.819
¶ They told me
That wasn't the way ¶

04:49.890 --> 04:53.058
<i> ¶ Fitting in</i>
<i> With the fairy crowd ¶</i>

04:53.060 --> 04:57.562
<i> I tried to join their picnic</i>
<i> Up upon a pink cloud ¶</i>

04:57.564 --> 05:01.300
<i> ¶ They didn't like the way</i>
<i> I crashed their buffet ¶</i>

05:01.302 --> 05:03.302
¶ Hey, that's not
The fairy way ¶

05:03.304 --> 05:07.506
¶ No, Chrysta,
That isn't the way ¶

05:09.610 --> 05:11.443
<i> ¶ And then the pixie test ¶</i>

05:11.445 --> 05:13.312
<i> ¶ With all the rest ¶</i>

05:13.314 --> 05:16.381
<i> ¶ I had hoped at last to bond ¶</i>

05:17.851 --> 05:20.819
<i> ¶ But I messed up</i>
<i> With my frond ¶</i>

05:20.821 --> 05:24.256
<i> ¶ So I flunked</i>
<i> And missed out on my wand ¶</i>

05:25.793 --> 05:26.825
Well,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.493
maybe you failed
the test once.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.095
But you won't this time.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.264
Because you're getting
a fairy trainer.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.465
Me!

05:33.467 --> 05:35.600
What do<i> you</i> know
about fairies?

05:35.602 --> 05:37.803
You say they're all
graceful and proper?

05:37.805 --> 05:39.771
Well, I go to
princess school!

05:39.773 --> 05:41.506
I take classes in
dance and etiquette--

05:41.508 --> 05:45.277
Okay, okay,
you've got the job.
Let's do this!

05:45.279 --> 05:47.946
First lesson, don't crack your
Enchantlet when you're happy.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.614
Right. Good coaching!

05:49.616 --> 05:52.617
¶ It's not that hard
To flit with a grin ¶

05:52.619 --> 05:55.287
¶ Now that you've got
A good friend ¶

05:55.289 --> 05:57.356
¶ Here to help you
Fit in ¶

05:57.358 --> 06:01.293
¶ So follow me just like
You're dancing ballet ¶

06:01.295 --> 06:03.628
¶ Chrysta,
That's the fairy way ¶

06:03.630 --> 06:07.466
¶ Sofia,
you showed me the way ¶

06:09.370 --> 06:11.636
¶ So starting from today ¶

06:11.638 --> 06:15.207
¶ Oh, Chrysta,
You found the fairy way ¶

06:16.643 --> 06:18.643
¶ Hey! I guess
They'll have to say ¶

06:18.645 --> 06:20.679
-¶ They'll have to say ¶
-¶ I found it ¶

06:20.681 --> 06:22.881
-¶ I found the fairy way ¶
-¶ You found the fairy way ¶

06:22.883 --> 06:25.183
¶ The fairy way ¶

06:25.185 --> 06:28.387
¶ The fairy way ¶

06:28.389 --> 06:29.488
I think you're ready.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.090
Ha! Let's go
stop that thief!

06:32.092 --> 06:35.627
Oh. Um, after you.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.832
Here it is,
the Fairy Forest.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.033
Those must be
the other fairies

06:42.035 --> 06:43.502
who are going to
take the test.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.204
If they're the only ones
allowed in the forest,

06:46.206 --> 06:48.840
one of them must
be the thief.
Let's check them out!

06:48.842 --> 06:52.444
Hello everyone! Are you here
for the Pixie Cup Tests too?

06:52.446 --> 06:54.946
Indeed we are.
I am Etheria,

06:54.948 --> 06:56.748
an air fairy
from Upper Breezia.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.619
I'm Sofia, an exchange fairy
from the EverRealm.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.853
And you are...?

07:01.855 --> 07:05.023
Chrysta. From...
just down the street.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.725
Hi. I'm Sofia.

07:06.727 --> 07:07.959
I'm Flurry.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.596
So... are you excited
to take the test?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.865
Of course!
When I get that magic,

07:13.867 --> 07:17.035
I'm going to spread beautiful,
wintry frost everywhere.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.171
I cannot wait to get to
that Pixie Cup!

07:20.741 --> 07:23.408
Hey, everyone. I'm Bridget,
the Forest Keeper.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.677
Follow me, please.
Mind the puddle.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.950
I thought only fairies
were allowed in here?

07:31.952 --> 07:35.754
She's a brownie.
A kind of fairy
that doesn't have wings.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.690
And by the look of it, she never
earned her wand either.

07:40.561 --> 07:44.162
And now, your judge
for today's Pixie Cup Tests.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.998
The Sugar Plum Fairy!

07:50.337 --> 07:52.170
Glittery greetings, everyone!

07:52.172 --> 07:53.305
She looks nice.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.173
First off,
let me say,

07:55.175 --> 07:56.241
I am not nice.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.176
But I am fair.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.011
All you must do
to earn your wand

08:00.013 --> 08:02.814
is pass the three stages
of the Pixie Cup Test,

08:02.816 --> 08:05.317
and do it in a gentle,
fairy-like manner.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.618
Remember our motto.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.687
"Always Be Delicate."

08:08.689 --> 08:10.789
Oh, I'm sunk.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.324
It's just like the last time.

08:12.326 --> 08:13.525
You can do this.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.427
Just stick to the things
we worked on.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.295
And I'm sure no one
even remembers.

08:17.297 --> 08:21.333
My sparkling stars!
Do I remember you.

08:21.335 --> 08:25.670
Um, Glittery greetings,
Sugar Plum Fairy.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.306
You're that, uh,
rough and tumble fairy

08:28.308 --> 08:31.176
who failed the very first
stage of the test.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.811
I had a cold.
[nervous laugh]

08:32.813 --> 08:34.479
But she's back,
to try again.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.948
Well, I'm sure
you'll do better.

08:36.950 --> 08:37.949
Thank you.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.285
So, as I said,

08:40.287 --> 08:42.821
this test shall come
in three stages,

08:42.823 --> 08:44.289
each leading to another,

08:44.291 --> 08:46.658
until finally
you reach the Pixie Cup

08:46.660 --> 08:48.627
and gain your magic wand.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.895
That doesn't sound so hard.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.162
But if you fail,

08:51.164 --> 08:52.864
even one of the stages,

08:52.866 --> 08:55.033
no wand for you.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.168
Now, without further ado,

08:57.170 --> 08:59.204
the first stage.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.641
The Dew Drop.

09:02.643 --> 09:06.244
A proper fairy must be able
to gently dapple flowers

09:06.246 --> 09:07.979
with morning dew.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.047
Like so.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.017
Now, your turn.

09:12.019 --> 09:15.820
Remember to use the lightest,
most delicate touch.

09:19.393 --> 09:22.694
Hey, it's kind of like
Enchanted Painting at RPA.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.196
I think I'm getting
the hang of it.

09:25.198 --> 09:29.100
Whoa! You're not taming
a sea monster. Be delicate.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.235
Just dab.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.770
Oh, dab?

09:31.772 --> 09:34.372
Dab, dab, dab, dab.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.373
There you go!

09:35.375 --> 09:37.242
[gasp] That winter fairy,

09:37.244 --> 09:39.244
Flurry. She's gone.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.712
She might be up to something.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.747
Dab, dab, dab.
I can't break my rhythm.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.584
Find her, report back.
Dab, dab, dab.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.052
Dab, dab, dab.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.087
Delicately dappled.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.088
Very nice.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.356
Uh, thank you.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.592
Hmm... I see some
broken stalks.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.060
[nervous laugh] Sorry!

09:55.062 --> 09:56.528
I started out a little rough,

09:56.530 --> 09:58.029
but I got a lot better.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.865
See? Dab. Dab. Dab.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.034
Feathers down, everyone.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.437
Oh, please.
Don't let me fail.

10:05.439 --> 10:08.406
I have inspected
everyone's work, and...

10:08.408 --> 10:10.942
[laughs] you all pass.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.077
You're kidding me?!

10:12.079 --> 10:13.278
I really did it?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.446
Flurry's back.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.115
And their are twigs
on her clothes.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.985
Maybe she snuck into the woods
to go after the Pixie Cup?

10:19.987 --> 10:21.319
Maybe.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.822
But let's not jump
to conclusions.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.858
Keep watch.
If she sneaks off again,
we'll follow her.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.898
[snoring]

10:33.900 --> 10:35.333
Look, it's Snoozle!

10:35.335 --> 10:37.268
Snoozle, indeed.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.437
We need a good sleeper
for stage two.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.773
-The Tooth Pull!
-[gasping]

10:41.775 --> 10:43.675
[laughs] Not to worry.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.577
It's not as bad as it sounds.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.079
Here's the tooth,
Miss Plum.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.016
Bridget, you really must
wash your hands.

10:51.018 --> 10:54.653
Sorry. Being Forest Keeper
is a dirty business.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.962
As you all know,
the Tooth Fairy has a big job.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.797
Sometimes, she needs help.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.499
So, for this phase of the test,

11:07.501 --> 11:10.135
you must prove that
you too can carefully...

11:10.137 --> 11:11.269
Approach.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.370
Pull.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.705
And Reward.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.173
A swan! Beautiful.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.643
All without waking him up.

11:18.645 --> 11:18.977
I'll go first.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.983
Hmm. I wonder
if there's a reason

11:24.985 --> 11:26.718
Flurry wanted to go first.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.853
Because she moves
so quietly?

11:36.296 --> 11:38.863
No. So she can
sneak away again!

11:38.865 --> 11:39.931
Let's go after her!

11:41.968 --> 11:43.635
Next up, Chrysta.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.671
But Flurry's getting away.

11:46.673 --> 11:49.574
I know, I know.
I'll do this
as fast as I can,

11:49.576 --> 11:50.775
then we can follow her.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.347
[mumbling]

11:56.349 --> 11:58.983
Blue butter...

11:58.985 --> 12:00.351
That was close.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.553
You got this, Chrysta.

12:01.555 --> 12:02.721
Remember how you taught me

12:02.723 --> 12:04.422
how to feather walk
over the snow?

12:04.424 --> 12:05.423
Right!

12:05.425 --> 12:06.491
Feather walk.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.731
Better take this part slow.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.404
Wait, I don't know
how to make a swan!

12:19.406 --> 12:21.372
Make another animal then.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.141
I better go
or we'll lose Flurry!

12:27.047 --> 12:30.048
Have to reach
that flower...

12:30.050 --> 12:32.684
Flower? She<i> is</i> trying
to get to the pixie cup!

12:35.522 --> 12:36.688
[grunts]

12:36.690 --> 12:39.090
Sofia? What are you doing here?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.525
I, uh...

12:40.527 --> 12:43.595
Well, I guess you
caught me red-handed.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.297
And now you're gonna get
what's coming to you...

12:46.299 --> 12:47.298
[gasps]

12:47.300 --> 12:49.734
-A corsage!
-Huh?

12:49.736 --> 12:52.403
When I saw all
the pretty flowers
growing in the woods,

12:52.405 --> 12:55.707
I couldn't resist.
Everyone's working so hard.

12:55.709 --> 12:57.609
I wanted to make these
for them as a gift.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.644
Oh. Thank you.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.045
You're very welcome.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.481
Now I'm off to give
the rest of them out.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.421
Oh! Bridget. I'm so sorry.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.589
I didn't see you there.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.792
I was just coming to
get you, Sofia.

13:13.794 --> 13:14.793
It's your turn.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.427
Oh, thanks, Bridget.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.062
Let me get that for you.
Here.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.565
That was...
very nice of you.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.601
Nobody ever said "sorry"
to me before.

13:23.603 --> 13:24.969
Or "thanks."

13:24.971 --> 13:26.905
Or even fetched
my shovel for me.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.574
Huh. Well,
I was happy to do it.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.683
Delightful, Sofia. And now...

13:38.685 --> 13:39.918
I judge.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.520
You have all passed again!

13:42.522 --> 13:43.655
[cheering]

13:43.657 --> 13:45.990
-Except for Chrysta.
-What?!

13:45.992 --> 13:48.860
You made
an origami Frost Dragon.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.995
The reward is supposed to be
something nice.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.964
Frost Dragons are nice.

13:52.966 --> 13:56.601
If you wear gloves to protect
against their poison fangs.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.369
Chrysta wrangles them
all the time.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.604
She would know.

13:59.606 --> 14:00.672
Hmm.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.640
Then I suppose...

14:02.642 --> 14:04.609
you pass too.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.178
Yes! [laughs]

14:07.180 --> 14:10.915
I mean.
I am quite pleased.
Quite.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.719
Now, some tasteful refreshments

14:14.721 --> 14:17.322
before our third
and final stage.

14:17.324 --> 14:21.159
Bridget!
Stop snacking and serve
the appetizers.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.061
As you wish, Miss Plum.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.129
Oh, gosh, I can't help it!

14:25.131 --> 14:26.965
I just love these scones.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.300
Glittery greetings!
Chrysta, right?

14:29.302 --> 14:31.002
Nice job on the last stage.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.238
You're a lot more delicate
than we first thought.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.472
Really?!

14:34.474 --> 14:36.808
Well, I think you're all

14:36.810 --> 14:40.712
really gentle and delicate
and... gentle!

14:40.714 --> 14:42.080
We just need to do

14:42.082 --> 14:44.649
-something about your clothes.
-And your hair.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.384
Would you, by any chance,

14:46.386 --> 14:49.320
be interested in
a fairy makeover?

14:49.322 --> 14:51.856
A makeover? Are you serious?

14:51.858 --> 14:53.825
I've always wanted a makeover!

14:53.827 --> 14:55.393
Sofia, what's a makeover?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.061
Chrysta! We have to talk.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.097
I know! Can you believe it?

14:59.099 --> 15:00.865
I passed twice!

15:00.867 --> 15:02.333
Congratulations,

15:02.335 --> 15:03.568
but we need to find--

15:03.570 --> 15:05.703
I mean, maybe you were right.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.705
Maybe I can fit in after all.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.941
Maybe I can even
make some fairy friends!

15:09.943 --> 15:11.409
Yeah, but...

15:11.411 --> 15:13.745
Chrysta, you're losing sight
of the mission.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.414
It turns out,
Flurry isn't the thief.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.383
She was just making
these corsages.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.685
[sighs]
Now I'm out of clues.

15:20.687 --> 15:21.686
I need your help.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.121
You're right, Sofia.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.689
I will absolutely help you.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.257
Chrysta! We're waiting.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.294
Right after my makeover!
Whatever that is.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.767
Perfect. And now
just a few more things...

15:35.769 --> 15:39.404
More? I can barely move
as it is. [laughs]

15:39.406 --> 15:41.539
Just take teeny, tiny steps.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.675
All fairies need
to accessorize!

15:44.611 --> 15:46.744
For me?

15:46.746 --> 15:48.346
They're so elegant.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.450
-What's wrong?
-Oh...

15:52.452 --> 15:54.786
I'm really
not supposed to
take this off.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.254
Don't you wanna be
one of us?

15:56.256 --> 15:58.890
I do. I really do!
It's just...

15:58.892 --> 16:01.492
I never take off
my Enchantlet,

16:01.494 --> 16:03.828
it's an important part
of being a...

16:03.830 --> 16:05.663
protector?

16:05.665 --> 16:08.900
Wow! I look so...

16:08.902 --> 16:09.968
delicate.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.005
Well... maybe I can take it off

16:14.007 --> 16:16.741
for just a little while.
[chuckles]

16:20.447 --> 16:22.113
Okay, listen up.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.349
It's time for
the final stage!

16:28.321 --> 16:31.322
This is the Fairy Frolic.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.924
If you make it
all the way to the end

16:32.926 --> 16:34.826
the Pixie Cup will appear,

16:34.828 --> 16:37.028
and a magic wand will be yours.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.530
But remember, it isn't enough
to make it past the obstacles,

16:39.532 --> 16:40.999
you must...

16:41.001 --> 16:43.334
Always Be Delicate!

16:43.336 --> 16:44.502
Who said that?

16:44.504 --> 16:46.137
Chrysta! Mmm!

16:46.139 --> 16:47.505
I like the new you.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.240
And I'll see you
at the end of the course!

16:52.012 --> 16:53.945
Sofia, did you hear that?

16:53.947 --> 16:55.780
I'm really fitting in!

16:55.782 --> 16:57.849
But you forgot
all about our mission.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.717
And we still don't know
who the thief is.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.320
Sofia, cease your worry.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.455
I can be a delicate fairy
and a Protector.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.790
Whomever the thief is,

17:05.792 --> 17:07.125
they need to be at
the course's end

17:07.127 --> 17:08.726
when the Pixie Cup
appears, don't they?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.194
I guess so.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.163
Then I'll make sure
to get there before them.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.865
I'll volunteer
to go first!

17:13.867 --> 17:15.733
Oh, Fairy friends,

17:15.735 --> 17:17.468
if you don't mind,

17:17.470 --> 17:19.804
allow me to go first!

17:19.806 --> 17:21.606
Back up, give her some room.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.008
Oh!

17:24.010 --> 17:26.911
That's funny.
Someone left their plate here.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.147
Hmm, it's a scone.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.148
[sniffs]

17:30.150 --> 17:32.583
With blueberry butter?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.919
[gasp] Blue butter?!

17:34.921 --> 17:36.054
Snoozle's dream!

17:40.427 --> 17:43.061
A tunnel? Someone wants to go
under the trees

17:43.063 --> 17:45.930
and get to the Pixie Cup
before anyone else.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.765
And I think I know who.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.435
A certain someone
who love scones!

17:54.407 --> 17:58.242
Chrysta, that was the best
Fairy Frolic I've ever seen!

17:58.244 --> 17:59.610
You pass!

17:59.612 --> 18:03.548
At last! I'm going to be
a real fairy!

18:03.550 --> 18:06.084
Just dip this wand
into the Pixie Cup

18:06.086 --> 18:08.853
to receive your fairy magic.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.295
Ahh! A trap!

18:17.297 --> 18:18.763
Someone tricked us!

18:18.765 --> 18:19.964
But who?

18:19.966 --> 18:21.299
I'll tell you who.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.334
You can come out now,
Bridget!

18:24.370 --> 18:26.037
What?! It can't be...!

18:26.039 --> 18:29.073
All the clues pointed to her.
She was dirty all the time

18:29.075 --> 18:30.741
because she was
digging this tunnel,

18:30.743 --> 18:33.311
and... she loves scones
with blueberry butter!

18:33.313 --> 18:35.213
So<i> that</i> was
the blue butter.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.647
It's all true!

18:36.649 --> 18:39.250
I always dreamed
of being a real fairy,

18:39.252 --> 18:41.919
but when I took the tests,
you failed me!

18:41.921 --> 18:44.956
Well, you are rather
un-fairy like.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.257
Says you!

18:46.259 --> 18:48.126
So now I'm going
to help myself

18:48.128 --> 18:50.294
to<i> all</i> the fairy magic.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.496
Oh no you don't!

18:52.966 --> 18:54.298
Oh yes I do!

18:54.300 --> 18:55.399
Whoa!

18:57.070 --> 18:59.737
No, Bridget!
Don't take all the magic!

18:59.739 --> 19:02.206
There'll be none left
for any other fairy ever!

19:04.777 --> 19:05.943
[chuckles]

19:05.945 --> 19:07.345
That's the idea!

19:07.347 --> 19:08.513
[groaning]

19:09.649 --> 19:12.450
You're not going anywhere!

19:12.452 --> 19:15.153
Oh no, I took
my Enchantlet off!

19:15.155 --> 19:16.354
Bye!

19:16.356 --> 19:17.655
[laughing]

19:20.627 --> 19:22.193
We've got to stop Bridget.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.194
Right!

19:23.196 --> 19:25.029
If you can catch up to her

19:25.031 --> 19:27.298
and hold her wand
in the Pixie Cup again,

19:27.300 --> 19:29.300
the blossom's magic
will be restored.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.801
Sorry Sugar Plum Fairy,

19:30.803 --> 19:32.236
but there's no time
to be delicate.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.872
Go, Chrysta!

19:37.944 --> 19:40.144
You're not getting out
of this forest, you fake fairy!

19:40.146 --> 19:41.212
[grunting]

19:49.155 --> 19:51.055
[gulp] She really doesn't
give up!

19:54.994 --> 19:56.060
Thanks, Sofia!

19:58.298 --> 19:59.363
What's happening?

19:59.365 --> 20:00.631
Is this part
of the test?

20:03.836 --> 20:05.903
Halt! In the name
of the Protectors!

20:15.148 --> 20:18.216
So you caught up to me.
How are you gonna stop me?

20:18.218 --> 20:20.251
I have all the Fairy magic.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.153
And you don't even have a wand.

20:22.155 --> 20:24.322
No, but she has this!

20:34.867 --> 20:36.834
What if I shared
my magic with you?

20:36.836 --> 20:39.804
No, thanks.
I'm fine just as I am.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.878
Chrysta, you did it!

20:47.880 --> 20:49.247
We did it!

20:52.552 --> 20:55.453
Oh! My Fairy Frolic course!

20:55.455 --> 20:57.355
Sorry, everyone. [laughs]

20:57.357 --> 20:59.090
I guess, the truth is,

20:59.092 --> 21:01.092
I was never meant to
be delicate.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.060
I'm just... me.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.862
And if that means
I fail the test

21:04.864 --> 21:07.732
and will never fit in here,
I understand.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.768
Fail? Chrysta,
you've succeeded...

21:10.770 --> 21:12.770
in saving the magic
of the fairies!

21:14.374 --> 21:16.607
[gasp] Does this mean...?

21:20.880 --> 21:22.813
I did it, Sofia!

21:22.815 --> 21:24.615
You deserve it, Chrysta.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.250
And so does Bridget.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.052
-What?
-I don't understand.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.053
Why?

21:29.055 --> 21:31.455
Because there's more
to being a real fairy

21:31.457 --> 21:33.291
than just being gentle
and delicate.

21:33.293 --> 21:36.193
And Chrysta has
just shown us that.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.903
Really? After what I did?

21:45.905 --> 21:48.105
Oh. I was wrong
to have failed you

21:48.107 --> 21:49.573
just for being different.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.309
There is room for
all kinds of fairies

21:51.311 --> 21:52.376
on this Isle.

21:59.152 --> 22:02.453
You all passed!
Come and get your wands!

22:02.455 --> 22:04.355
We did it!

22:04.357 --> 22:06.357
At last!

22:06.359 --> 22:09.327
-Even you, Princess.
-You knew?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.962
I'm the Sugar Plum Fairy.
I know everything.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.065
But thank you
for your help.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.803
Chrysta, I love how you, whoosh!

22:18.805 --> 22:20.805
Plowed right through
those hedges!

22:20.807 --> 22:22.840
And how did you
fly so fast?

22:22.842 --> 22:25.710
And snap that magic rope-thing?
Can you show us?

22:25.712 --> 22:29.580
Why not? Ya see, it's really
all in the wrist.

22:30.817 --> 22:31.882
That's my Chrysta.
