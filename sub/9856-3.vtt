00:20.496 --> 00:21.496
Allo?

00:25.096 --> 00:26.616
- Hi, Tom.
- Good morning.

00:26.816 --> 00:27.816
Hello, Jaques.

01:30.696 --> 01:31.936
Oh, my God. Tom!

01:50.896 --> 01:53.376
Okay, take cover, take cover now!

01:56.536 --> 01:58.336
How many ways in and
out of the seventh floor?

01:58.456 --> 01:59.632
- What is going on?
- Someone is shooting

01:59.656 --> 02:01.176
from the seventh floor! How many ways?

02:01.216 --> 02:03.136
Just the stairwell and the lift, that's it.

02:03.256 --> 02:04.432
Kill the lift. Call the police,

02:04.456 --> 02:06.192
tell them there is a mass
shooting at this address.

02:06.216 --> 02:07.416
Shouldn't you just wait for...

02:26.016 --> 02:27.336
Police! I am armed!

02:45.256 --> 02:47.616
This is Probationary Officer Annette...

02:49.336 --> 02:51.496
Know the biggest mistake a rookie makes?

02:52.536 --> 02:53.776
When they draw their weapon,

02:53.936 --> 02:55.696
they only see what's
directly in front of it.

02:55.736 --> 02:57.096
It's called tunnel vision.

03:10.096 --> 03:11.696
What time is her mother coming?

03:12.216 --> 03:14.456
She said she would be on
the 5:00 p.m. from Paris.

03:14.936 --> 03:16.776
Imagine how hard that trip will be.

03:17.096 --> 03:18.496
Probably easier than her last trip.

03:19.016 --> 03:20.856
Well, on the last trip
at least there was hope.

03:22.976 --> 03:25.976
What is it about morning in The Hague, huh?

03:27.016 --> 03:29.816
The light looks like a Vermeer.

03:30.096 --> 03:32.056
Oh, you know Vermeer?

03:32.256 --> 03:33.856
Does that surprise you, Louis?

03:34.136 --> 03:35.136
Kind of.

03:35.816 --> 03:36.896
What's in the box?

03:38.496 --> 03:39.936
Anne-Marie's things.

03:44.816 --> 03:45.936
Don't forget that.

03:46.936 --> 03:49.976
Actually, I thought... you might want it.

03:53.976 --> 03:55.416
Yeah, I'd like that. Thanks.

03:57.016 --> 03:59.456
- Carlton, do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

04:14.496 --> 04:15.816
Hickman wants her nameplate?

04:16.656 --> 04:18.016
It's not so surprising.

04:18.616 --> 04:19.616
Good morning, all.

04:20.096 --> 04:22.416
Hey, glad to officially have you on board.

04:22.536 --> 04:24.136
- Glad to be on board.
- Welcome.

04:24.656 --> 04:26.256
Grazie, Eva. Grazie mille.

04:26.896 --> 04:27.896
You speak Italian?

04:28.056 --> 04:30.656
And Dutch, and German, and English.

04:30.896 --> 04:31.896
What about Irish?

04:32.336 --> 04:33.936
Sorry, nobody understands Irish.

04:34.496 --> 04:35.496
Amen.

04:37.416 --> 04:38.416
Is this me?

04:39.056 --> 04:43.216
Uh... yeah. Yeah, it's yours.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.536
This the sniper in Paris yesterday morning?

04:54.976 --> 04:57.656
Five dead, including two police officers,

04:58.016 --> 05:01.736
a young rookie with her training
officer having breakfast.

05:01.936 --> 05:03.136
Wrong place, wrong time?

05:03.536 --> 05:04.536
Appears that way.

05:04.776 --> 05:06.456
- This what you wanted to show me?
- No.

05:07.096 --> 05:08.096
It's about Rebecca.

05:09.136 --> 05:10.816
She's going to be our prosecutor.

05:12.776 --> 05:13.976
I hear she was good.

05:14.776 --> 05:15.776
Very good.

05:17.136 --> 05:21.016
- Is she ready?
- Yes. I think so.

05:21.216 --> 05:22.456
- Major?
- Yeah?

05:23.016 --> 05:25.616
I'm sorry. Dorn is here with
Moreau, the Paris detective?

05:25.976 --> 05:27.136
- I'm coming.
- Okay.

05:29.376 --> 05:31.896
If I can be of help, you let me know.

05:32.496 --> 05:33.696
Thank you very much.

05:34.296 --> 05:39.096
Here. Louis, Hickman, you recognize Moreau?

05:40.496 --> 05:43.576
He's just come from that
horrific sniper shooting in Paris

05:43.736 --> 05:45.696
to request our help tracking the shooter.

05:45.856 --> 05:47.496
There was a note left by the shooter.

05:47.656 --> 05:49.496
The original is being tested for evidence,

05:49.616 --> 05:51.176
but I... I brought you a photocopy.

05:52.256 --> 05:55.136
"The proles will refuse
to bellyfeel blackwhite.

05:55.536 --> 05:57.656
One hundred million Euro by Thursday,

05:58.016 --> 06:00.416
or five more will die somewhere in Europe.

06:00.896 --> 06:02.536
You cannot stop me. W.S."

06:03.456 --> 06:05.136
By Thursday? May I?

06:06.416 --> 06:07.416
Tomorrow.

06:38.056 --> 06:41.336
"Bellyfeel blackwhite?"
What the hell does that mean?

06:41.976 --> 06:43.376
It's Newspeak,

06:43.816 --> 06:48.296
which is, of course, the language
that George Orwell created for 1984.

06:48.416 --> 06:49.416
What does it mean?

06:49.776 --> 06:52.696
Ah, well, in Oldspeak,
it... roughly it means,

06:52.896 --> 06:55.376
"You can't pull the wool
over the peoples' eyes."

06:55.936 --> 06:58.056
In this particular instance, I...

06:58.576 --> 07:01.776
I think it means that instinctively

07:02.256 --> 07:05.976
people will reject the
notion that black is white.

07:06.336 --> 07:07.336
Black is white?

07:07.856 --> 07:09.816
It's one of the central
premises of the book.

07:09.976 --> 07:11.976
The authoritarian government insists that

07:12.416 --> 07:16.256
citizens unquestioningly believe
things that are inherently untrue.

07:16.376 --> 07:18.096
Such as black is white.

07:18.376 --> 07:20.336
He signs it "W.S."

07:20.656 --> 07:24.856
Well, because the main character
in the novel is Winston Smith.

07:25.016 --> 07:28.016
Wasn't Winston Smith a
bureaucrat? A functionary?

07:28.496 --> 07:30.656
I don't remember him being violent at all.

07:30.896 --> 07:34.136
No, he wasn't. And certainly,
he didn't kill anyone,

07:34.536 --> 07:37.176
and of all people, he would not

07:37.536 --> 07:42.136
be participant in the
multiple targeting at random.

07:42.456 --> 07:44.936
Well, then, maybe he's just
doing this to throw us off.

07:45.216 --> 07:48.656
A killer like this usually
doesn't do anything without reason.

07:48.896 --> 07:51.416
He can't honestly believe anyone's
going to give him that money.

07:51.736 --> 07:55.776
Moreau, has he been in contact
with anyone since he left that note?

07:56.256 --> 07:57.536
No. No one.

07:57.776 --> 08:00.216
Well, then, he's not
expecting to get any money.

08:00.376 --> 08:01.856
He's using this as a ruse

08:02.016 --> 08:05.216
to keep us from understanding
what his true goal is.

08:05.696 --> 08:08.136
Which starts with understanding 1984.

08:08.696 --> 08:12.696
The square, it must have
more than five people in it.

08:13.616 --> 08:14.856
Why'd he stop shooting?

08:15.336 --> 08:18.336
Initially, we thought
people must have run away.

08:18.536 --> 08:21.016
But there was only one shot heard.

08:21.416 --> 08:23.616
- One shot that killed five people?
- No, no,

08:23.896 --> 08:25.616
but there was only one shot heard.

08:25.936 --> 08:29.296
And then the female officer ran
across the square into the building.

08:29.496 --> 08:31.576
- She took a grand risk.
- Is that when he shot her?

08:31.856 --> 08:32.895
She wasn't shot.

08:33.256 --> 08:36.655
There was a confrontation
at the site of the shooting.

08:37.256 --> 08:40.296
He pushed her out the window,
seven floors to her death.

08:42.736 --> 08:44.015
So you're taking the case?

08:44.736 --> 08:47.536
Yes. But I have a question.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.096
Does your boss know you're here?

08:52.496 --> 08:54.616
Moreau, go to the scene.

08:55.136 --> 08:56.816
I'll get it authorized in the Court.

08:57.696 --> 09:00.936
That should be enough to handle any
objections that Laveaux might have.

09:15.776 --> 09:17.696
You'll be more comfortable inside.

09:18.816 --> 09:21.176
I feel like a child on
her first day at school.

09:21.496 --> 09:23.016
First day back to school,

09:23.816 --> 09:26.336
and it's a school in
which you excel, Rebecca.

09:28.336 --> 09:29.416
Here goes.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.536
Well, it's not as elegant
as the one you left.

09:34.696 --> 09:37.576
Please. It's absolutely fine.

09:45.776 --> 09:47.256
Come with me, Rebecca.

09:48.016 --> 09:50.256
I have to get authorization from the Court

09:50.816 --> 09:53.256
allowing our team to
track the sniper in Paris.

09:53.456 --> 09:55.216
It's a good place for you to start.

09:55.336 --> 09:56.736
I think that you should be a part

09:56.856 --> 09:58.576
of this case right from the very beginning.

09:58.696 --> 10:01.456
Can I... I just need
a moment to freshen up.

10:01.896 --> 10:03.176
I'll just be down the hall.

10:04.376 --> 10:07.016
Oh, God, what am I doing here?

10:08.616 --> 10:09.616
Okay.

10:11.416 --> 10:12.416
Okay.

10:12.736 --> 10:13.736
I can do this.

10:22.976 --> 10:23.976
Carl?

10:26.616 --> 10:27.816
I'm missing something,

10:28.856 --> 10:30.216
something right in front of me.

10:30.416 --> 10:31.816
Well, stay on it.

10:32.336 --> 10:34.856
We don't have much time,
and even less to go on.

10:35.656 --> 10:37.336
There are only three victim files?

10:37.776 --> 10:41.776
Yes, a sanitation worker,
a bicyclist, and an au pair,

10:42.376 --> 10:43.576
but we found no connection.

10:44.616 --> 10:46.216
Yeah, but there were five victims.

10:46.576 --> 10:47.696
What about the officers?

10:48.176 --> 10:49.616
You want to investigate them?

10:49.856 --> 10:51.296
We need to know who they were.

10:51.496 --> 10:52.216
What is it?

10:52.376 --> 10:54.816
Two Parisian officers were murdered,

10:54.936 --> 10:57.456
so our detectives are not going to be happy

10:57.616 --> 11:01.776
about an outside agency
intruding on their case.

11:01.976 --> 11:03.896
The only reason for use to be involved

11:04.616 --> 11:07.096
would be another shooting
in a different country.

11:08.536 --> 11:09.976
That's it, that's it.

11:11.736 --> 11:12.736
That's what's bugging me.

11:12.856 --> 11:16.176
"Five more will die somewhere in Europe."

11:16.736 --> 11:18.576
If he had said, "Five more will die,"

11:19.336 --> 11:21.056
the assumption would be that he meant Paris

11:21.176 --> 11:22.456
and we could not be on the case.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.496
This note has the exact right phrasing

11:25.616 --> 11:27.936
to ensure that we are involved.

11:30.563 --> 11:31.683
You think it was planned.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.563
I don't know, but...

11:34.163 --> 11:36.483
I got a hard time with
the concept of coincidence.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.116
I've felt more welcome in
the ladies changing room.

11:54.396 --> 11:56.396
Really? I've never been welcome in one.

11:56.556 --> 11:58.636
Sebastian, check up there
if there is any evidence.

11:58.756 --> 12:01.276
Arabela, come with me.
We'll talk to the witnesses.

12:01.636 --> 12:03.636
Tommy and Eva, look at the tactical.

12:03.996 --> 12:06.916
- Do you want to know how he did it?
- Mostly why he did it from there.

12:08.916 --> 12:09.916
Commissaire Laveaux.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.076
This scene is closed.

12:12.196 --> 12:13.996
I have an authorization from the ICC.

12:14.156 --> 12:15.996
This has nothing to do with the ICC.

12:16.276 --> 12:18.476
Two Parisian officers were killed.

12:18.836 --> 12:20.972
- You can't just come in here...
- You're right. You're right.

12:20.996 --> 12:23.156
You're right. You're right. You're right.

12:23.316 --> 12:25.436
The man who killed your comrades

12:25.556 --> 12:29.396
left a note threatening to do
the same somewhere in Europe.

12:29.556 --> 12:30.796
We will participate only

12:30.956 --> 12:33.916
if the case takes us outside
of France to another country.

12:34.036 --> 12:36.516
Until then, we want to provide assistance.

12:36.876 --> 12:39.276
You lost two officers
and I know what you feel,

12:39.796 --> 12:42.116
the pressure you are
under. I just want to help.

12:42.756 --> 12:43.956
I give you my word.

12:47.876 --> 12:48.916
Show them the scene.

12:49.716 --> 12:50.716
Thank you.

12:57.356 --> 12:59.876
...today in Paris where
a sniper opened fire

13:00.036 --> 13:01.476
in a public square not far from...

13:01.596 --> 13:02.756
...National University...

13:02.876 --> 13:03.876
Whiskey?

13:03.956 --> 13:05.116
...at 9:00 a.m. this morning,

13:05.196 --> 13:06.292
- two French police officers...
- Double.

13:06.316 --> 13:09.356
were killed, along with
three other civilians.

13:09.796 --> 13:11.596
The victims were pronounced
dead at the scene.

13:12.076 --> 13:13.836
The medical examiner has determined...

13:14.716 --> 13:18.236
...were struck, execution-style,
with a single bullet to the head.

13:18.516 --> 13:20.876
Police have not released the
identities of the victims,

13:21.036 --> 13:22.132
- pending notification...
- Another.

13:22.156 --> 13:23.156
of next of kin.

13:31.516 --> 13:34.156
Tearing up our authorization
form from the Court?

13:34.716 --> 13:36.436
Did I, or did I not?

13:37.036 --> 13:38.036
Ah...

13:39.196 --> 13:43.156
Seeger, this one has much to teach you.

13:43.316 --> 13:44.516
I think you all do.

13:46.453 --> 13:48.933
The coffee cart owner is ready
if you'd like to talk to him.

13:49.052 --> 13:50.052
Yeah.

13:59.572 --> 14:00.612
It's not optimal.

14:02.852 --> 14:04.732
The other side of the square would be.

14:05.092 --> 14:07.652
The sun would be behind him
at this time in the morning.

14:07.892 --> 14:09.372
Maybe he isn't that experienced?

14:09.732 --> 14:12.532
Nobody who can hit a moving target
from this range is an amateur,

14:12.692 --> 14:14.212
especially shooting into the sun.

14:14.572 --> 14:16.012
My guess would be military training.

14:16.692 --> 14:17.812
A lot of it.

14:18.732 --> 14:21.252
There are other reasons
to use this building,

14:21.372 --> 14:22.372
though, despite the sun.

14:22.892 --> 14:24.852
For instance, this floor
being under construction.

14:25.332 --> 14:28.092
Like Hickman says, that's
probably no coincidence.

14:29.012 --> 14:30.372
I'm ready for some scans.

14:38.732 --> 14:42.092
Jaques LemiÃ¨re. L-E-M-I...

14:42.412 --> 14:43.772
The other officers have your name.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.812
We just want to know what you remember.

14:46.932 --> 14:48.972
Remember? I remember all of it. I...

14:49.092 --> 14:50.172
I will never forget.

14:50.452 --> 14:53.012
How can I ever forget something like this?

14:53.132 --> 14:56.532
I mean, you watch television, but
you don't think it will ever...

14:57.332 --> 14:58.772
Not to you. Other people, but

14:58.892 --> 15:00.812
- not you...
- Jaques...

15:02.652 --> 15:03.652
breathe.

15:04.092 --> 15:07.732
Now, sit and take a
sip of water, and relax.

15:09.332 --> 15:10.532
Look at that.

15:11.372 --> 15:12.372
What?

15:12.852 --> 15:15.092
The window frame, the one he fired from?

15:15.772 --> 15:19.092
There's a smooth, almost
perfect covering of gases

15:19.212 --> 15:20.492
and gunshot residue.

15:20.932 --> 15:22.012
On what part of the frame?

15:22.572 --> 15:23.572
All of it.

15:24.052 --> 15:25.572
Top, bottom, sides.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.812
It's an even dispersement
in all directions.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.492
That's why no one heard the shots.

15:30.852 --> 15:32.772
I had just brought out Jean's breakfast.

15:32.892 --> 15:33.612
Jean?

15:33.772 --> 15:36.452
Yes, the local officer who walks this area.

15:36.692 --> 15:38.412
The one with the female officer?

15:38.532 --> 15:41.172
Yeah. Yeah, Anette, his trainee. She was...

15:43.692 --> 15:45.372
What happened to her was...

15:46.372 --> 15:48.652
- Jaques, stay focused.
- Okay.

15:49.372 --> 15:51.692
The officer arrived and ordered coffee?

15:52.492 --> 15:54.692
No. No, I prepared his order first.

15:55.052 --> 15:56.732
First? Before he arrived?

15:56.852 --> 16:01.612
Yes, Jean is here every morning,
9:00 sharp. He is very methodical.

16:02.652 --> 16:05.412
Was. He was methodical.

16:05.732 --> 16:06.732
What happened next?

16:07.092 --> 16:11.692
Um, I was taking another
order, and there was a shot.

16:11.892 --> 16:12.892
A shot.

16:13.252 --> 16:15.212
Yes, one shot, like... like a crack.

16:15.492 --> 16:19.532
I turned, and could see
it came from this building.

16:20.852 --> 16:21.852
I saw the smoke,

16:22.332 --> 16:24.532
saw the rifle being pulled back in,

16:24.892 --> 16:28.852
and I heard Anette make a
sound, and then I saw Jean.

16:29.012 --> 16:30.012
He was...

16:32.252 --> 16:33.252
he had been hit.

16:35.612 --> 16:37.932
That one shot hit the officer?

16:38.292 --> 16:39.292
Yeah.

16:40.252 --> 16:43.212
And then Anette ran
off toward the building,

16:44.092 --> 16:46.252
and it was only after that I...

16:46.572 --> 16:51.652
I noticed other people on the ground,
other people that had been shot.

16:52.012 --> 16:56.092
After the officer ran off,
the others were already shot?

16:56.652 --> 16:57.652
Yes.

16:57.692 --> 16:59.452
- You're sure.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

17:01.272 --> 17:03.112
"Bellyfeel blackwhite..."

17:05.071 --> 17:06.512
"Bellyfeel blackwhite."

17:09.432 --> 17:10.152
"Bellyfeel..."

17:10.271 --> 17:12.271
My team has gone over this note many times.

17:13.832 --> 17:15.472
It doesn't seem to make much sense, huh?

17:15.832 --> 17:17.791
We're going through 1984 as well.

17:17.912 --> 17:20.872
Forensics came back on the original.
The note is completely clean.

17:21.031 --> 17:22.752
No prints, no DNA.

17:22.912 --> 17:25.752
Can't be easy to handwrite a
note and leave no prints or DNA.

17:26.192 --> 17:27.392
Same thing I thought.

17:29.472 --> 17:30.912
Four shots in the time he had

17:31.032 --> 17:33.192
and from where he shot is remarkably good.

17:33.312 --> 17:34.952
Knows his way around forensics, too.

17:35.392 --> 17:36.832
No prints or DNA on the note.

17:37.072 --> 17:37.872
Are we looking at a cop?

17:38.032 --> 17:39.392
Sure starting to look that way.

17:39.512 --> 17:41.632
And we also know why
no one heard any shots.

17:41.792 --> 17:45.392
Yeah. The ScanGen picked up
gunshot residue and gas particles

17:45.552 --> 17:47.792
on the window frame in a wide,
in a wide diffuse pattern.

17:47.952 --> 17:50.472
Evenly spread, the way a
suppressor would dispense the gases.

17:50.712 --> 17:53.152
- But they did hear one shot.
- Yes, the last one.

17:53.312 --> 17:55.432
The one that killed the
older cop and drew the rookie.

17:55.712 --> 17:57.792
Those officers weren't
wrong place, wrong time.

17:58.299 --> 17:59.379
They were the targets.

18:02.919 --> 18:04.559
The officers were the target?

18:05.079 --> 18:06.879
The only shot that anybody heard

18:07.039 --> 18:08.959
was the one that killed
the older police officer.

18:08.999 --> 18:11.639
The witness said when
the officer was shot...

18:12.239 --> 18:13.615
The others were already on the ground.

18:13.639 --> 18:15.079
The audible shot was the last one.

18:15.399 --> 18:18.919
He used a silencer, but he
wanted the last shot heard.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.199
Why?

18:20.559 --> 18:23.079
Eva said it. To draw
the young officer to him.

18:23.559 --> 18:26.159
Why go to all this trouble
to kill two officers

18:26.319 --> 18:28.479
he could have shot while
they were having their coffee?

18:29.199 --> 18:30.639
Because he wanted a show.

18:31.119 --> 18:35.119
Sir? He says he's the sniper.
He calls himself Winston Smith.

18:36.079 --> 18:37.999
That's him. That's the note, "W.S."

18:38.359 --> 18:40.759
I'm sorry, sir, he asked
specifically for Major Daniel.

18:45.079 --> 18:46.279
Sebastian, trace the call.

18:47.999 --> 18:48.999
Winston Smith?

18:49.479 --> 18:52.599
I'm calling from a prepaid cell
phone that cannot be traced.

18:52.759 --> 18:55.759
Then we should talk in person. Let's meet.

18:55.999 --> 18:57.399
Do you find this funny?

18:57.519 --> 19:00.759
No. There is nothing funny
about murder, Mr. Smith. Nothing.

19:01.079 --> 19:02.599
- You have my note?
- Yes.

19:02.879 --> 19:05.959
Then I'm guessing by your
attitude you also have my money?

19:06.199 --> 19:09.559
You surely know that we need
more than a day to raise that sum.

19:09.719 --> 19:10.719
The European Central Bank

19:10.799 --> 19:13.199
holds money from every
country in the EU, does it not?

19:13.274 --> 19:16.594
28 countries contributing just
over three and a half million each.

19:17.034 --> 19:18.514
A statistical blip.

19:18.714 --> 19:21.114
100 million is no blip.

19:21.634 --> 19:24.474
Keep that phone with you.
I'll call you in the morning.

19:24.714 --> 19:26.754
You asked for me. Do we know each other?

19:27.194 --> 19:28.474
Everybody knows you.

19:28.754 --> 19:30.274
You and your team are quite famous.

19:30.434 --> 19:34.034
But that could be undone
doublefast, even vaporized.

19:38.754 --> 19:39.914
What the hell was that?

19:40.034 --> 19:43.034
I guess that's more Newspeak, like 1984.

19:43.194 --> 19:46.314
The money is more plausible
if you split it in 28 ways.

19:46.474 --> 19:48.354
You'll never get 28 countries to agree.

19:49.034 --> 19:51.394
Have you ever watched a session
of the European Parliament?

20:46.567 --> 20:47.567
I'm not asleep.

20:47.847 --> 20:48.967
But you are in the dark.

20:50.807 --> 20:52.367
I watched the sun go down.

20:53.607 --> 20:55.247
There was no reason to turn the light on.

20:55.887 --> 20:57.767
Sun went down two hours ago.

21:00.447 --> 21:03.007
How did it go in Paris,
at the shooting scene?

21:03.207 --> 21:04.207
Routine.

21:04.647 --> 21:07.327
Dorn is making some calls
about getting the money.

21:10.607 --> 21:11.807
No cases at home.

21:12.007 --> 21:13.007
Good idea.

21:14.007 --> 21:15.007
Agreed.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.807
So... what is troubling you?

21:18.087 --> 21:19.447
I'm not sure I can do this, Louis.

21:21.567 --> 21:23.407
Everything seemed foreign to me. So...

21:24.887 --> 21:26.167
changed.

21:27.127 --> 21:28.127
Okay.

21:31.407 --> 21:32.127
Okay.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.567
This work is too important.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.527
If you're not capable,

21:35.647 --> 21:37.928
- you should not do it...
- I didn't say I wasn't capable.

21:38.687 --> 21:39.687
I mean...

21:41.927 --> 21:45.727
what do you expect, the
first day after six years?

21:46.247 --> 21:48.527
You are the one who said you want to quit.

21:48.967 --> 21:50.447
I've never said quit in my life.

21:51.407 --> 21:52.407
I'm sorry.

21:52.967 --> 21:55.087
If you think I'm not capable of this job,

21:56.047 --> 21:58.207
you're going to be very
surprised, Mr. Daniel.

21:59.207 --> 22:00.487
Very surprised.

22:06.247 --> 22:07.407
You will be a star.

22:09.087 --> 22:10.327
You always are.

22:11.047 --> 22:12.047
Okay.

22:15.367 --> 22:16.447
Now, I'm ready for bed.

22:17.127 --> 22:20.087
- I'm not really tired.
- Did I say tired?

22:22.527 --> 22:24.727
Did the word tired ever
come out of my mouth?

22:41.647 --> 22:42.887
What time is it?

22:51.167 --> 22:51.927
I...

22:52.087 --> 22:55.367
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Nurse! Nurse!

22:57.447 --> 22:58.447
What time is it?

22:58.647 --> 23:01.447
Shh... What? What, baby?

23:02.087 --> 23:03.327
How long?

23:06.287 --> 23:07.687
Let me get the doctor, okay,

23:07.967 --> 23:09.527
and then I'll explain it all to you.

23:11.433 --> 23:12.793
Everything, okay?

24:05.793 --> 24:06.793
Yes.

24:08.433 --> 24:09.433
What?

24:11.313 --> 24:12.313
Where?

24:24.645 --> 24:26.005
Are you the team from the ICC?

24:26.325 --> 24:28.485
- Major Louis Daniel.
- Detective Ripchen.

24:28.925 --> 24:30.165
We appreciate the assistance.

24:30.725 --> 24:33.205
- We've never had anything like this...
- We are not assisting.

24:33.925 --> 24:36.405
This same man killed five
people two days ago in Paris.

24:36.565 --> 24:38.885
This is a cross-border,
systematic, ongoing crime.

24:39.045 --> 24:42.525
This is ours now, officially.
Your superiors have been notified.

24:46.005 --> 24:47.805
- Well, no one told me.
- Then make the call,

24:48.285 --> 24:49.421
and when you learn I'm right,

24:49.445 --> 24:52.205
turn over any witness
information to Detective Seeger.

24:54.405 --> 24:56.005
- Let me make some calls.
- Yeah.

25:01.965 --> 25:03.645
Well, that was pretty straightforward.

25:03.925 --> 25:05.365
We have work to do, so let's do it.

25:06.605 --> 25:10.965
Hey, mate. McConnell, Berger,
Seeger and Vittoria from the ICC.

25:11.245 --> 25:12.525
Yes, we heard you were coming.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.381
All the bodies are still in
the spots where they fell?

25:14.405 --> 25:15.405
All five.

25:15.685 --> 25:16.925
Medics didn't work on them?

25:17.085 --> 25:19.845
They were all shot through the
head. There was nothing to work on.

25:19.965 --> 25:21.141
Where did the shots come from?

25:21.165 --> 25:22.165
We don't know.

25:22.365 --> 25:25.005
No one heard a single shot to
give us a direction to look.

25:25.285 --> 25:26.325
He used suppressors.

25:26.565 --> 25:28.285
There were some searches of the rooftops,

25:28.405 --> 25:30.485
but no evidence was found in the dark.

25:30.965 --> 25:32.645
There will be another search this morning.

25:33.125 --> 25:35.845
I might be able to use the
ScanGen to establish a bullet path,

25:36.325 --> 25:37.805
a trajectory through the victims.

25:38.685 --> 25:41.405
If we can do that with two
or three, we can triangulate.

25:43.165 --> 25:44.741
But you'll need to know the exact position

25:44.765 --> 25:46.021
they were in before they were shot, though.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.845
Yeah, whether they were
sitting or standing.

25:48.045 --> 25:49.525
Did the family members stay?

25:50.005 --> 25:52.045
Yes. They are in the mosque.

25:52.805 --> 25:55.085
The Imam and his wife
are taking care of them.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.581
We can see if they remember whether
they were sitting or standing.

25:57.605 --> 25:58.805
While we scan the bodies.

26:01.805 --> 26:02.805
Famke?

26:03.085 --> 26:04.205
Can you put the kettle on?

26:07.485 --> 26:09.125
I found some old books in storage.

26:09.885 --> 26:12.245
Doesn't anyone read the
law around here anymore?

26:13.045 --> 26:14.085
You are...?

26:15.125 --> 26:17.565
Rebecca Daniel? We met yesterday?

26:17.845 --> 26:20.285
Well, I know who you are, but you're here,

26:20.725 --> 26:22.965
- and it's only 7:00 a.m.
- Don't worry.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.805
I don't expect you to be here this early.

26:25.245 --> 26:28.085
No, no, I love it. No one ever...

26:29.525 --> 26:31.125
Let me put those books away.

26:31.965 --> 26:32.965
Famke...

26:33.685 --> 26:36.005
right now I would love
a cup of black coffee.

26:36.205 --> 26:37.205
Okay.

26:37.365 --> 26:40.925
Then... I want legal
precedent on multiple homicide

26:41.365 --> 26:43.765
and all lesser included
gun and battery charges,

26:43.925 --> 26:45.725
in Paris, France and Sofia, Bulgaria.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.485
I want to be ready to charge this
sniper properly when they catch him.

26:50.405 --> 26:52.205
The books can wait.

26:53.205 --> 26:55.605
You mean if they catch him, right?

26:56.125 --> 26:59.325
Oh, Famke, you clearly
don't know my husband.

27:01.085 --> 27:02.525
Come on, you son of a bitch!

27:03.325 --> 27:05.365
Funny, you usually say
that right to my face.

27:05.765 --> 27:07.805
I don't think I've ever
caught you calling me names.

27:08.605 --> 27:11.285
"Keep that phone with you. I
will call you in the morning."

27:11.445 --> 27:13.365
- That's what he said to me.
- I was there.

27:13.925 --> 27:17.605
- He lied.
- Did he? It's still morning.

27:18.885 --> 27:20.245
He killed five more people.

27:20.405 --> 27:21.941
He said he was going
to do that in the note.

27:21.965 --> 27:24.005
"Five more on Thursday".
As far as I can tell,

27:24.725 --> 27:26.605
this whole thing happened
right about midnight.

27:27.045 --> 27:28.485
He waited until Thursday.

27:28.885 --> 27:30.885
He didn't even give me a
chance to get the money.

27:31.885 --> 27:32.885
"Me?"

27:33.845 --> 27:34.845
Us.

27:35.885 --> 27:37.325
He didn't give us a chance,

27:37.525 --> 27:39.245
and I'm sure that he
would argue that point.

27:39.285 --> 27:40.525
He said "on Thursday."

27:41.045 --> 27:42.765
That has passed, but you don't really think

27:42.885 --> 27:44.165
this is about the money, do you?

27:44.405 --> 27:45.405
What is it about?

27:46.365 --> 27:47.805
That we don't know yet.

27:48.365 --> 27:50.045
Hey, lads! We might have something.

27:51.405 --> 27:52.405
Not yet.

27:58.965 --> 28:01.005
So, I was able to scan the bodies

28:01.125 --> 28:03.621
and establish the path of the
bullets as they passed through them.

28:03.645 --> 28:05.445
Arabela, can you turn
off the lights, please?

28:11.605 --> 28:15.765
Okay, these lines are bullet trajectories.

28:17.565 --> 28:20.765
Well, Arabela and I were able to
talk to the companions of the victims

28:20.885 --> 28:22.341
about their position before they were shot.

28:22.365 --> 28:23.685
Most of them were very specific.

28:24.165 --> 28:26.085
For instance, victim one
was sitting cross-legged

28:26.205 --> 28:27.485
on a blanket watching the movie,

28:28.325 --> 28:31.605
victim two was sitting up with his
fiancÃ© leaning back against him,

28:31.725 --> 28:34.605
and victim three was walking through
the aisles coming back from the loo.

28:34.765 --> 28:37.885
Now, when I add that
information to the modelling...

28:44.725 --> 28:46.085
That's the highest point.

28:49.805 --> 28:52.005
Well, this point definitely
covers the entire square.

28:52.645 --> 28:55.245
I'll go get the ScanGen and
see if we can find any residue,

28:55.605 --> 28:56.965
make sure this is the right spot.

28:57.685 --> 28:58.685
Hey, don't bother.

29:02.885 --> 29:04.845
- "Minority of one."
- Mean something to you?

29:05.165 --> 29:06.565
It's another reference to the book.

29:06.645 --> 29:08.525
The lead character asks if being a lunatic

29:08.685 --> 29:09.965
is just being a minority of one.

29:11.285 --> 29:13.885
Just because I don't like to read
doesn't mean I'm not good at it.

29:15.085 --> 29:16.085
Guys.

29:19.645 --> 29:20.885
Enjoying yourself?

29:21.485 --> 29:24.205
There is nothing enjoyable
about murder, Mr. Daniel.

29:24.565 --> 29:25.285
Nothing.

29:25.405 --> 29:26.645
You're not interested in money.

29:26.845 --> 29:29.405
I'll be dead long before
I can spend any of it.

29:29.645 --> 29:30.645
What do you want?

29:30.845 --> 29:32.405
You used to be French, right?

29:32.765 --> 29:33.805
I am still French.

29:34.085 --> 29:36.645
No. You're European now.

29:36.925 --> 29:40.285
A citizen of the European Union.
We gave up our identities, Louis.

29:40.485 --> 29:41.925
We let a bunch of bureaucrats

29:42.045 --> 29:46.005
throw away centuries of
individuality for easier trade.

29:47.925 --> 29:48.925
For money.

29:49.285 --> 29:51.285
Even your team is an abomination.

29:51.765 --> 29:55.325
What are you doing on a
rooftop in Sofia, Bulgaria?

29:55.645 --> 29:58.485
That's how it works. How
the collective takes over.

29:58.765 --> 30:01.765
First they change your money so
you're on shaky economic ground,

30:02.085 --> 30:04.605
then they take over the familiar
forms of local government,

30:04.725 --> 30:05.725
like the police.

30:06.725 --> 30:08.045
Everything you know

30:09.085 --> 30:10.085
changes

30:10.845 --> 30:13.525
until you're just like a cog
in the wheel like Winston Smith.

30:14.605 --> 30:16.005
A functionary.

30:28.605 --> 30:30.605
Oh, Louis. Really?

30:31.965 --> 30:33.245
Isn't that beneath you?

30:33.645 --> 30:34.805
What is it you want?

30:35.365 --> 30:37.005
I want my message out.

30:38.565 --> 30:41.165
I want people to hear what I have
to say, and I want you to do it,

30:41.205 --> 30:43.285
you and your team of bastard cops.

30:44.525 --> 30:46.285
You want me to deliver your message?

30:46.805 --> 30:49.685
Mm-hmm, at a press conference
before the world's cameras.

30:51.045 --> 30:52.085
And if I don't?

30:52.565 --> 30:54.125
I have five rounds for tomorrow,

30:54.325 --> 30:56.165
and the day after that,
and the day after that.

30:56.205 --> 30:58.325
How will I contact you
to give you an answer?

30:58.525 --> 31:00.245
The press conference will be the answer.

31:00.805 --> 31:01.885
Or not.

31:04.365 --> 31:05.765
I'll get the message.

31:09.325 --> 31:11.445
Arabela, tell the press
we'll make an announcement.

31:11.565 --> 31:12.565
Yes, sir.

31:13.605 --> 31:14.965
Wait, wait, there's...

31:15.325 --> 31:17.125
there's something else
that we need from them.

31:17.245 --> 31:19.165
We need to know where on the continent

31:19.325 --> 31:21.485
that chopper's images
are broadcasting live.

31:21.605 --> 31:22.765
Absolutely live.

31:23.961 --> 31:26.001
He saw me. He saw me raise the finger.

31:26.161 --> 31:29.321
Yeah. Well, most networks add a 30
second time delay for breaking news,

31:29.561 --> 31:31.201
in case something too shocking happens.

31:31.761 --> 31:34.721
I'd like to find out what the network
considers too shocking to show.

31:35.081 --> 31:36.481
The list gets smaller every day.

31:36.881 --> 31:37.881
All right, listen up.

31:38.201 --> 31:40.361
The press doesn't like to
talk to the police in groups.

31:40.481 --> 31:42.137
They don't want to look
like they're being bullied.

31:42.161 --> 31:44.257
But separately, they all want to
make out like they're your friend

31:44.281 --> 31:45.961
so they can call on you later for a story.

31:46.201 --> 31:48.001
Any cop who trusts the press is an idiot.

31:48.961 --> 31:51.361
Let them think you will cooperate.

31:51.561 --> 31:52.801
Let them think you're friends.

31:53.041 --> 31:56.681
That's right. Hand out cards,
give them your cell number.

31:56.881 --> 31:58.161
Can I give them his cell number?

31:58.321 --> 31:59.521
Aye, and I'll give them yours.

31:59.841 --> 32:02.041
- Who gave you my cell number?
- You don't want to know.

32:04.281 --> 32:07.761
Louis, finding where those
images are broadcasting live

32:07.921 --> 32:09.281
will give us an area to look in,

32:09.761 --> 32:11.601
but we need to find a
way to narrow that down.

32:11.961 --> 32:13.161
- You have an idea?
- Yeah.

32:13.801 --> 32:15.321
Based on who I think he is.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.121
- You think?
- I'm pretty sure.

32:18.361 --> 32:19.361
And if you're wrong?

32:21.041 --> 32:22.121
People may die.

32:22.721 --> 32:23.921
People are dying now.

32:26.123 --> 32:27.123
What do you got?

32:28.043 --> 32:30.923
Only four sources broadcast
from that particular chopper live

32:31.083 --> 32:32.603
without any delay whatsoever.

32:32.963 --> 32:35.003
A station covering west
coast of Spain and Portugal.

32:35.163 --> 32:36.163
And all of Norway.

32:36.483 --> 32:38.083
Half of Austria, and all of Switzerland.

32:38.443 --> 32:39.683
Not Sofia? Not locally?

32:39.883 --> 32:41.499
They weren't broadcasting anything at all.

32:41.523 --> 32:43.859
It's too close for them. The
bodies are still on the ground.

32:43.883 --> 32:46.363
Spain and Portugal are too far
for what he's capable of doing.

32:47.203 --> 32:49.763
Paris, home, now Sofia,
and, apparently, home again.

32:49.883 --> 32:51.243
Norway seems too far as well.

32:51.443 --> 32:53.683
It is. Our best shot is
Austria or Switzerland.

32:53.883 --> 32:56.163
You guys should head in that
direction on the chopper.

32:56.563 --> 32:57.563
And do what, man?

32:57.763 --> 32:59.803
Austria and Switzerland is
a pretty big search area.

33:00.563 --> 33:01.683
Leave that to me.

33:02.203 --> 33:03.203
What do you mean?

33:03.323 --> 33:06.019
I'm going to do this press conference
and I'm going to narrow it down.

33:06.043 --> 33:08.283
Didn't he say he wanted Louis
to do the press conference?

33:08.323 --> 33:10.643
Who is doing the talking will
be the least of his problems.

33:11.003 --> 33:12.723
Especially when he
hears what I have to say.

33:13.163 --> 33:15.083
But won't that put more victims at risk?

33:15.283 --> 33:16.603
Only if it doesn't work.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.963
I'm not the guy you want on a raid
of a sniper's house anyway, am I?

33:20.443 --> 33:22.803
And I want to meet this
Mr. Winston in person.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.523
Sebastian, you should
stay and we can check out

33:25.643 --> 33:26.843
any information that comes in.

33:26.923 --> 33:28.043
We will be on the sat phone.

33:28.963 --> 33:30.403
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

33:30.683 --> 33:33.723
My name is Carl Hickman. I'm a
retired New York City detective

33:34.643 --> 33:38.643
who now works for the ICC's
investigative team out of The Hague.

33:39.843 --> 33:43.003
We are currently assisting
the Sofia, Bulgaria police

33:43.163 --> 33:45.483
in investigating this
latest cowardly attack

33:45.763 --> 33:48.843
by the same man who shot
a number of people in Paris

33:49.163 --> 33:50.243
a couple of days ago.

33:50.403 --> 33:51.643
We have actually been in

33:52.363 --> 33:54.443
contact with this piece of sh...

33:55.883 --> 33:57.083
with this perpetrator,

33:58.203 --> 34:01.923
and he asked us to have
this press conference...

34:02.363 --> 34:03.523
Cowardly's right.

34:04.862 --> 34:06.582
Shooting people from the roof of something,

34:06.662 --> 34:08.181
they don't even know they are targets.

34:08.223 --> 34:10.583
Kind of like hunting though.

34:10.902 --> 34:12.223
It's nothing like hunting...

34:12.623 --> 34:14.422
...could make a point is by murdering

34:14.583 --> 34:16.183
10 innocent people and demanding...

34:16.422 --> 34:19.822
- Another.
- Mein gott. How about just asking?

34:22.943 --> 34:24.463
...but never mind what he wants.

34:24.822 --> 34:26.623
Here's what we're going
to talk about instead.

34:27.943 --> 34:30.663
I'm going to tell you how
you can help us catch him.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.503
You know how after police
catch a serial killer,

34:33.703 --> 34:35.543
the neighbors always say
that they had no idea?

34:36.103 --> 34:38.743
"He was such a quiet guy,
he never bothered anybody."

34:38.902 --> 34:40.183
Well, that's not this guy.

34:40.623 --> 34:44.382
That's not the make-up of a
personal cause perpetrator.

34:44.943 --> 34:48.023
This guy's not quiet.
This guy bothers everybody.

34:48.223 --> 34:50.223
You know him, but you're not friends.

34:50.382 --> 34:53.783
In fact, he doesn't have
many people that he tolerates

34:53.983 --> 34:55.783
and he has no friends because he's a jerk.

34:55.983 --> 34:57.743
And he complains. Loudly.

34:57.983 --> 35:02.143
He will have complained repeatedly
about the formation of the EU,

35:02.383 --> 35:06.263
and about the loss of individual
identity under the new system.

35:06.423 --> 35:07.463
And he might have said,

35:08.183 --> 35:10.583
at different times, something
very similar to these words,

35:10.743 --> 35:13.903
"We let a bunch of bureaucrats

35:15.263 --> 35:17.903
toss out a century worth of individuality

35:18.023 --> 35:19.423
just to make trade easier.

35:19.743 --> 35:20.743
For money."

35:20.823 --> 35:21.823
Or something like...

35:22.743 --> 35:23.903
"The collective takes over.

35:24.103 --> 35:25.663
You know, first they change your money,

35:25.863 --> 35:28.383
then they change the police, and
then they change the government

35:28.423 --> 35:29.839
and they crush you like you're nothing,

35:29.863 --> 35:31.343
and you're just a cog in the wheel."

35:31.703 --> 35:32.703
That's this guy.

35:33.703 --> 35:35.943
So help us catch him,

35:36.823 --> 35:39.343
and call the number that's flashing
on the bottom of the screen.

35:40.383 --> 35:42.423
If this guy sounds familiar, call us.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.143
Thank you.

35:50.583 --> 35:51.583
Hickman.

35:55.823 --> 35:56.623
Are you sure?

35:56.823 --> 35:58.423
The description fits him perfectly.

35:58.703 --> 36:01.983
Plus, the caller said this
guy's obsessed with 1984,

36:02.143 --> 36:03.543
and that was not public info.

36:03.823 --> 36:05.103
Did they tell you his real name?

36:05.463 --> 36:07.463
Alexander Fuster, Austrian National.

36:07.903 --> 36:10.583
There are some newspaper
articles about an Alexander Fuster

36:10.783 --> 36:13.143
who fought for the French Foreign Legion

36:13.343 --> 36:14.823
and then headed a SWAT team.

36:15.343 --> 36:17.943
Europol referred him for prosecution
after an on-duty shooting.

36:18.663 --> 36:19.663
Prosecution?

36:20.423 --> 36:21.663
According to the reports,

36:21.863 --> 36:24.623
a rookie cop misidentified
a hostage as the bad guy,

36:24.943 --> 36:27.063
and Fuster killed him before
he had any authorization.

36:28.223 --> 36:30.543
Maybe that's why he took his
time with the rookie in Paris.

36:30.823 --> 36:32.903
- I'll let you know what happens.
- All right.

36:36.183 --> 36:38.663
Austria, outside Klagenfurt,

36:39.623 --> 36:40.663
the south border.

37:16.783 --> 37:17.783
It's time.

37:23.423 --> 37:25.463
The cabin is about a half kilometer in.

37:25.703 --> 37:27.423
We have a soft perimeter right now.

37:27.543 --> 37:28.663
Tell your men to find cover.

37:28.863 --> 37:30.663
He's a fierce accurate long-range shot.

38:18.623 --> 38:20.463
Alexander, come out!

38:23.583 --> 38:24.623
Are you okay, sir?

38:26.983 --> 38:28.623
You are completely surrounded!

38:30.103 --> 38:31.103
Don't make this...

38:34.543 --> 38:37.103
Tommy, how good is he?

38:37.543 --> 38:39.223
One of the best I've ever seen. Why?

38:39.863 --> 38:41.263
He could have shot me both times.

38:42.263 --> 38:43.423
He shot high.

38:43.943 --> 38:45.423
Well, you don't know that for sure.

38:48.063 --> 38:49.263
Major, I don't think that's...

38:50.303 --> 38:51.303
Alexander!

38:51.783 --> 38:54.183
I am coming out of cover!

38:54.743 --> 38:57.503
Unarmed! Let's talk!

38:58.703 --> 39:00.023
Let me know when you have a shot.

39:00.263 --> 39:01.263
Yes, Major.

39:20.223 --> 39:21.303
You didn't bring me here

39:22.063 --> 39:25.063
to shoot me without talking first.

39:25.823 --> 39:27.263
You have something to say to me.

39:31.463 --> 39:32.463
Come out.

39:33.543 --> 39:34.543
Alexander.

39:43.903 --> 39:46.343
Busybodies like you ruined my life.

39:46.863 --> 39:48.303
I didn't pull that trigger.

39:48.903 --> 39:51.423
I had no intention of hurting that hostage,

39:51.863 --> 39:53.303
and Europol knew it.

39:53.583 --> 39:55.823
And they had no authority to be in Austria,

39:55.983 --> 39:58.183
much less telling me and
my men what I could do.

39:58.663 --> 39:59.663
Europol,

40:00.303 --> 40:01.303
Interpol,

40:01.463 --> 40:03.023
and now your ICC.

40:04.623 --> 40:07.423
Leave the local police
alone, can you do that?

40:07.583 --> 40:08.823
The world is getting smaller.

40:09.183 --> 40:11.023
Every day, a bit smaller.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.903
And swallowing people.

40:13.063 --> 40:16.823
Swallowing lives, swallowing individuality.

40:16.983 --> 40:18.943
I am not losing my identity,

40:20.543 --> 40:21.703
it's growing.

40:22.463 --> 40:23.463
I am a citizen,

40:24.343 --> 40:25.823
not just of France,

40:26.823 --> 40:29.543
but a citizen of Europe, of the world.

40:30.023 --> 40:33.223
When people realize that Italian sergeants

40:33.383 --> 40:36.303
and Irish cops are bullying
their sovereign citizens

40:36.823 --> 40:40.503
and killing people they have no
jurisdiction over, they will rebel.

40:40.903 --> 40:42.743
No one has to be killed by anyone.

40:43.143 --> 40:44.143
I have a shot.

40:45.503 --> 40:46.503
Me, too.

40:47.463 --> 40:48.943
I have two snipers of my own,

40:49.863 --> 40:52.743
and right now, they both have shots.

40:53.143 --> 40:54.143
Are they good?

40:54.463 --> 40:55.143
Very.

40:55.303 --> 40:57.463
Because if they can't get
a shot off before I do,

40:57.623 --> 40:58.903
then it's lights out for you.

40:59.223 --> 41:01.263
- For both of us.
- But the difference is,

41:01.383 --> 41:02.623
I am prepared to die.

41:03.343 --> 41:06.223
I've mailed manifestos to all
the major papers of Europe.

41:06.583 --> 41:08.983
I've taped videos for the news networks.

41:09.303 --> 41:12.303
You don't have to die for
your message to be heard.

41:12.583 --> 41:14.863
Your smaller world is a visual one.

41:15.423 --> 41:19.063
Today, you pretty much do
have to die to make your point.

41:32.303 --> 41:33.623
You made your point...

41:35.583 --> 41:36.583
for nothing.

41:46.503 --> 41:48.743
Michel, we're going to
go with terrorism as well.

41:49.023 --> 41:50.023
Rebecca...

41:51.063 --> 41:53.583
we will not be prosecuting the sniper.

41:54.143 --> 41:55.023
I'm sorry?

41:55.143 --> 41:58.783
The team, he made them kill him.

41:59.423 --> 42:00.423
Is Louis all right?

42:00.823 --> 42:03.103
Oh, fine. They're on the way back home.

42:03.343 --> 42:04.343
Good.

42:04.743 --> 42:07.423
Thank you, Rebecca.

42:42.383 --> 42:43.383
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:44.423 --> 42:46.983
- Did the team go home?
- Yeah, yeah, everybody just left.

42:48.743 --> 42:50.063
Did, um...

42:52.303 --> 42:56.903
Anne-Marie's mom, did she come
by today and... and get her stuff?

42:57.623 --> 42:59.303
- No.
- Oh.

42:59.743 --> 43:00.863
She called.

43:01.383 --> 43:03.823
She came all the way to Amsterdam and then

43:05.063 --> 43:06.663
she couldn't face the office.

43:07.583 --> 43:11.263
She said coming here made
it too real, too final.

43:12.103 --> 43:15.103
Shari, my... my friend from the carnival,

43:15.463 --> 43:18.743
she... she woke up last night.

43:19.023 --> 43:22.143
Oh, she did? Why didn't you tell me?

43:22.383 --> 43:24.783
Ah, just, uh, didn't find the time today.

43:28.863 --> 43:29.863
How is she?

43:30.263 --> 43:32.143
The doctors say that she's better than...

43:32.583 --> 43:34.623
than they'd... than they'd hoped.

43:34.983 --> 43:35.983
But...?

43:36.583 --> 43:38.863
She wants to know how
long she was unconscious.

43:41.543 --> 43:44.143
I think she really wants
to know what happened.

43:44.543 --> 43:45.423
Fair question.

43:45.543 --> 43:48.063
Yeah. It's the answer that I don't like.

43:48.543 --> 43:49.543
What's the answer?

43:58.063 --> 44:02.303
Rough stuff happens to people
around me, Louis, good people.

44:02.543 --> 44:03.863
I'm not crying about it.

44:05.463 --> 44:06.623
It's just true.

44:08.903 --> 44:10.463
I have known you for years.

44:11.223 --> 44:12.783
Nothing bad's happened to me.

44:13.143 --> 44:14.383
I said "good people."

44:21.023 --> 44:23.703
Want me to come with you,
to be your moral support?

44:24.023 --> 44:25.023
No.

44:28.063 --> 44:30.783
Some walks you've got to
do on your own, you know?

44:31.623 --> 44:34.663
Yes. I do know.

44:35.943 --> 44:36.943
Thank you.

44:50.543 --> 44:52.303
Should be for everyone to see.

44:53.305 --> 44:59.659
