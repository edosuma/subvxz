39:37.560 --> 39:40.320
I got this.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.640
<i>Sign the papers.</i>

40:14.320 --> 40:17.160
Look, your brother's dead,
your power base is gone.

40:17.440 --> 40:20.880
Your lieutenants, they're already
fighting for a piece of this.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.720
Toronto.
Rhymes with money.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.840
- <i>Carla.</i>
- It's about time, Frank.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.800
Precisely what I don't have.

40:33.880 --> 40:36.640
Call Tarconi, have him
find a Detective Stanwick.

40:36.680 --> 40:40.080
- He's the one who set you up?
- No, it's the other guy, Ryder.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.920
GPS me, give Tarconi the information.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.280
<i>Tell him that Ryder is
dirty and I have proof.</i>

40:46.880 --> 40:52.200
You were at my daughter's
christening. And now all of this?

40:52.280 --> 40:56.840
It's not personal.
He just wants that building.

40:56.920 --> 40:59.680
- He won't kill me, Dad.
- He killed your uncle.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.800
No, no, if you sign this contract,

41:01.880 --> 41:04.320
then everything you've
ever worked for is gone.

41:04.400 --> 41:08.160
If I don't, then everything
I have ever lived for is gone.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.520
And now you're both dead.
[ gasping ]

41:20.360 --> 41:22.560
Ah!!!

41:26.640 --> 41:29.440
Dad, call the police!

41:30.640 --> 41:34.640
<i>Police! The Adam Smith
construction project downtown.</i>

41:58.000 --> 42:00.920
Thought you might need a hand.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.360
<i>You know, all you had
to do was say thank you,</i>

42:11.440 --> 42:12.600
and I would have stood by you.

42:12.880 --> 42:16.120
But no, I was supposed
to take the fall for everything.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.880
What the fuck does that mean?

42:18.160 --> 42:22.560
- A little appreciation goes a long way.
- Shut the fuck up, Stanwick.

42:28.280 --> 42:32.240
You should hang on to that building.
It's good to keep a little of the past alive.

42:32.280 --> 42:37.000
- It will never be torn down.
<i>- I owe you a debt of gratitude.</i>

42:37.080 --> 42:39.680
This city will never be able to
thank you for what you've done.

42:39.760 --> 42:43.200
But I must ask...
my brother's hand?

42:43.280 --> 42:45.960
Lost in the shuffle.
Best forgotten.

42:48.040 --> 42:53.040
Frank...
will I see you again?

42:53.080 --> 42:56.600
The next time I'm in Toronto,
I'll swing by.

42:57.960 --> 43:00.400
I'd like that.

43:07.320 --> 43:10.280
[ dog barking ]

43:32.200 --> 43:34.680
[ cell phone ringing ]

43:36.720 --> 43:38.560
<i>Hey, Frank.</i>

43:38.640 --> 43:41.120
When are you coming back?
I got the red car

43:41.200 --> 43:44.680
ready for you to drive again.
No mishaps this time.

43:44.760 --> 43:49.360
- How did it go seeing other clients?
<i>- Oh, it was great. Fine.</i>

43:49.440 --> 43:52.720
It was bad.
He didn't appreciate me.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.520
I appreciate you, Dieter.

43:54.560 --> 43:57.840
See? A little appreciation
goes a long way.

43:57.880 --> 44:00.600
I know, Dieter, I know.
