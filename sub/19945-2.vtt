Good morning, Claire-- Grace!

00:54.680 --> 00:56.474
Who's Claire?

00:57.058 --> 00:59.852
You're late for work... again.

00:59.935 --> 01:01.479
I'm on London time.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.522
Well, then you're eight hours late.

01:03.606 --> 01:07.610
Business day starts at 9:00 a.m.,
Pacific Standard Time.

01:08.069 --> 01:09.987
And we arrive dressed.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.073
-Having had.
-Having had what?

01:12.156 --> 01:13.741
Breakfast.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.451
At the kitchen island.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.203
Not in the workspace.

01:17.286 --> 01:21.290
I'm still picking veggie-bacon shards
out of my keyboard from yesterday.

01:21.373 --> 01:23.751
I eat and talk with gusto, Grace.

01:23.834 --> 01:27.296
Especially when it's about our biz,
about which I am highly jazzed,

01:27.379 --> 01:28.506
because I'm on a roll.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.965
I mean, I'm hot, man.

01:30.049 --> 01:33.427
Not only am I an artist,
I'm also a businesswoman.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.930
I'm a hyphenate... or slash.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.348
What do you think?

01:37.431 --> 01:38.808
I don't know, ask Claire.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.603
-I have an announcement to make.
-Oh, so do I!

01:42.686 --> 01:44.396
When do we talk about new business?

01:44.480 --> 01:47.233
All right, new business, 10:15.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.819
-Can I make my announcement?
-Nobody's stopping you.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.987
We have an appointment tomorrow
at an incubator.

01:52.071 --> 01:53.697
We're getting chickens?

01:53.781 --> 01:57.910
We are not getting chickens!
We are never getting chickens!

01:57.993 --> 02:00.329
Then why are we going to an incubator?

02:01.288 --> 02:03.207
It's a business incubator, Frankie.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.961
You know, where new businesses
find funding and start-up support.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.588
We don't belong at a bank
with our company.

02:10.214 --> 02:13.092
We belong someplace
where new ideas are embraced and--

02:15.261 --> 02:16.929
Frankie, are you even listening to me?

02:17.012 --> 02:19.557
No, not since you said
we're never getting chickens.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.685
Is it 10:15 yet?

02:22.768 --> 02:24.770
I give up. Yes, it's 10:15.

02:24.854 --> 02:26.772
Hold onto your seatbelts, or hat.

02:26.856 --> 02:28.566
No, you don't wear hats.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.860
But you should.
You have the head for it.

02:30.943 --> 02:33.195
-Okay, new business is over.
-No, no, no, no!

02:33.279 --> 02:37.241
We've talked about making a bunch
of different products for older adults.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.619
Well, older adults need easy-open condoms.

02:40.703 --> 02:43.455
And where may I ask
did this great idea come from?

02:44.039 --> 02:45.457
I had a dream.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.168
Let me set the scene for you:

02:47.251 --> 02:50.379
I was shaving a cat,
only it wasn't a cat.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.630
And it wasn't me--

02:51.714 --> 02:52.882
[door opens]

02:52.965 --> 02:55.467
Good morning. Have you seen my truck keys?

02:56.802 --> 02:58.095
Um...

02:58.178 --> 02:59.722
Your truck keys?

03:00.472 --> 03:03.976
I, uh... I think they were
on the smaller side table,

03:04.059 --> 03:08.689
next to the longer... sleep table.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.399
Thanks.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.483
See you later?

03:12.151 --> 03:13.194
[door closes]

03:14.111 --> 03:15.696
You had a "dream."

03:16.280 --> 03:18.866
Oh, there were dreams all right, Grace.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.993
Dreams fulfilled.

03:21.076 --> 03:21.952
[Grace gasps]

03:22.745 --> 03:24.747
"Dreams" plural?

03:24.830 --> 03:26.749
Multiple dreams?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.877
Frankie, how could you
not tell me about this?

03:29.960 --> 03:33.172
Grace, I am a private person.

03:33.255 --> 03:36.258
[scoffs] You are the least private person
in the world!

03:36.342 --> 03:38.552
First time I met you,
you pulled up your shirt and said,

03:38.636 --> 03:40.095
"Do these things look right?"

03:40.179 --> 03:42.389
Look, I haven't had time to tell you

03:42.473 --> 03:46.435
because my whole life has been working
with you and sleeping with Jacob.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.354
This is why we need more coffee breaks.

03:48.437 --> 03:51.982
I have been there for every "should I"
and "shouldn't I" with you two.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.817
How could you leave me hanging now?

03:53.901 --> 03:57.571
I don't know. You've made such a big deal
out of sex in the vagina.

03:57.655 --> 04:00.074
And you were right, it is a big deal.

04:00.157 --> 04:04.078
Right? Turns out sex is pretty good
with a man who's not closing his eyes

04:04.161 --> 04:05.412
and pretending you're a man.

04:05.496 --> 04:08.165
True, but condoms are hell to open

04:08.249 --> 04:10.626
and having a pair of scissors
on the bedside table

04:10.709 --> 04:12.920
just doesn't set the right... tone.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.588
You guys use condoms?

04:14.672 --> 04:18.467
I still haven't emerged completely
from perimenopause.

04:19.385 --> 04:20.928
I'm gonna bet you have.

04:21.011 --> 04:24.098
Well, regardless,
Jacob is a pretty hot number,

04:24.181 --> 04:27.518
and I don't want to wonder every time
I get a new itch or scratch down there.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.104
Okay, score one for safe sex.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.898
We're making a vibrator first.

04:32.982 --> 04:36.610
We have to concentrate on that.
I like that you're thinking.

04:36.694 --> 04:39.822
Keep that thinking cap on.
Keep it on real tight.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.371
I love our new house.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.999
I love our new fan in our new house.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.793
If I wasn't married to you,
I'd marry that fan.

04:52.876 --> 04:57.715
"Man marries ceiling fan.
Honeymoon proves tricky. News at 11:00."

04:58.924 --> 05:01.552
Enough joy for one morning. Time for work.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.804
I could stomach more joy.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.598
There's plenty of joy to be had at work.

05:06.682 --> 05:07.641
There's none.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.352
-Come on.
-No!

05:11.312 --> 05:13.522
-Up and at 'em!
-No! No!

05:13.605 --> 05:15.816
You're just a mean old lawyer.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.280
He's gonna be here in ten minutes.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.240
That's why I'm pretending to be working.

05:23.324 --> 05:26.452
Well, then here are those
imaginary file folders you asked for.

05:27.870 --> 05:28.829
Yeah.

05:30.164 --> 05:31.040
Hi.

05:32.583 --> 05:33.792
Got a sec?

05:34.376 --> 05:36.211
Yeah, I was just working.

05:36.795 --> 05:37.755
Oh, Barry's here.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.632
You can send him right in
and then get out.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.302
Okay. [clears throat]

05:44.303 --> 05:45.304
Hey.

05:47.598 --> 05:52.186
So, Sharon from HR is insisting
I do this, uh, exit interview with you.

05:52.895 --> 05:55.189
-You're actually leaving?
-Yeah.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.857
I told you I was leaving.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.360
I gave my two-weeks' notice
and I got another job.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.321
So, yeah, pretty much.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.616
How do I know that box
isn't full of office supplies?

06:06.450 --> 06:08.327
Is this funny to you?

06:10.454 --> 06:13.624
No, it's not funny to me. I honestly,
I don't understand how we got here.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.833
That's the problem.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.044
You don't.

06:18.295 --> 06:21.381
I like you, you like my dog,
we both hate Sharon.

06:21.465 --> 06:23.008
Why isn't that enough?

06:24.593 --> 06:25.594
It isn't.

06:27.513 --> 06:28.347
Not for me.

06:31.809 --> 06:35.270
I don't like how this interview is going,
so I'm canceling it and you can't exit.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.149
Goodbye, Brianna.

06:45.614 --> 06:46.698
Nope.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.376
Well, well, well.

06:57.459 --> 07:00.170
And here I had a whole speech prepared
for when you were late again.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.631
Ah, well, save it for tomorrow.

07:03.507 --> 07:06.301
-Oh, hello.
-Oh, Jacob's here.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.345
[scoffs] Yeah, I can see that.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.097
Um...

07:11.181 --> 07:13.434
Uh, the only thing is, you know,
I took a vote

07:13.517 --> 07:15.769
and we agreed to eat
at the kitchen island.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.730
This table is our office now.

07:18.814 --> 07:21.400
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.360
So many rules to keep track of.

07:23.444 --> 07:24.987
But since he's new here,

07:25.070 --> 07:28.240
he can have one last breakfast
in the conference room.

07:28.323 --> 07:29.992
Of course.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.369
And please let the minutes reflect

07:32.453 --> 07:36.498
I ate my corn flakes before work,
at the kitchen island.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.626
Along with half a pineapple
stuffed with cookie dough.

07:39.710 --> 07:40.836
Noted.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.755
So, our meeting
with the incubator is at 2:00.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.967
And I've made an outline
of exactly what I think we should say.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.802
I also hid all your clogs.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.679
Oh, not all of them.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.264
[clog thudding]

07:52.347 --> 07:53.682
Did you bring it?

07:53.765 --> 07:55.350
-What?
-You know...

07:55.434 --> 07:56.810
Oh!

07:56.894 --> 08:01.190
-New business is at 10:15.
-Oh, God. [sighs]

08:01.273 --> 08:03.192
-What now?
-Nothing, I--

08:03.275 --> 08:06.153
Frankie has a really good idea.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.989
Well, you know, it's funny.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.992
Jacob and I were talking last night
about the business--

08:12.075 --> 08:15.537
Oh. So, you two were
talking about our business?

08:15.621 --> 08:19.708
Well, you know me, Grace.
I take my work home at night.

08:20.334 --> 08:23.086
I don't just shut it down at 3:00
like you do.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.671
We work till 5:00.

08:24.755 --> 08:29.551
We were thinking,
condoms might go over well at an incubator

08:29.635 --> 08:31.011
where a lot of young men work.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.305
Well, based on what I know
about tech guys,

08:33.388 --> 08:35.349
I don't think they're having
a lot of sex.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.726
-Hear us out. We did our homework.
-Yeah.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.937
We even mocked up a package.
Show her.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.355
[Frankie] Well...

08:42.981 --> 08:46.068
You poke... and it pops right out.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.112
"Poke and Pop."

08:49.196 --> 08:51.073
We're still working on the name.

08:51.156 --> 08:55.494
Okay, you know what? That sounds
like a super fun after-work hobby.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.205
But right now,
we have a meeting in five hours.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.917
Which is why we only wanted
five minutes of your time now.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.752
Do we want the money
for the prototype

09:03.835 --> 09:06.505
or do we want to sit here
and think up new ideas?

09:06.588 --> 09:08.215
We want to sit here
and think up new ideas!

09:08.298 --> 09:09.550
We're not doing that.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.177
That should be the name
of your autobiography.

09:12.844 --> 09:13.887
I don't get it.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.348
That should be the name
of her autobiography.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.225
-[Frankie chuckles]
-[cell phone rings]

09:18.308 --> 09:19.226
Oh!

09:19.935 --> 09:21.436
Unknown caller.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.647
Maybe I shouldn't answer.

09:25.315 --> 09:28.110
Hello? Yes, this is she.

09:28.694 --> 09:30.195
Hi, Trevor.

09:30.279 --> 09:33.782
Of course I care about the snow leopards.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.577
Why? What's happening?

09:37.244 --> 09:38.370
[Frankie] Uh-huh.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.247
Oh, really?

09:44.418 --> 09:46.587
Oh, this is terrible.

09:52.801 --> 09:53.719
Jacob...

09:55.012 --> 09:57.806
I really love having
a fresh voice at the table.

09:57.889 --> 10:01.768
You know, my ex-husband had some
great ideas when I started Say Grace.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.020
But?

10:03.562 --> 10:05.188
Yeah, but, um...

10:05.272 --> 10:10.152
You know sometimes it's really hard
to get Frankie to focus on one thing.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.446
[sighs]
You've seen her try to watch fireworks.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.198
I don't want her distracted.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.743
I think you just don't like it
when you don't get your way.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.912
I don't think anyone likes it
when they don't get their way.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.706
I think you like it a lot less
than the rest of us.

10:23.749 --> 10:26.918
You know what, I think I'll be
more comfortable in the studio.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.212
Do you have a problem with me?

10:30.130 --> 10:33.383
Actually, I do.
I don't like the way you treat Frankie.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.011
You were horrible to her the day
you crashed my lunch with the boys.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.556
All right, I apologized
to Frankie for that.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.517
I didn't apologize to you.
I am so sorry.

10:43.477 --> 10:47.814
I had way too much to drink that day,
which is not an excuse.

10:47.898 --> 10:50.400
No. No, it's not.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.985
But you know what they say:

10:52.069 --> 10:55.280
when someone shows you
who they really are, believe them.

10:55.781 --> 10:58.075
That is not who I really am.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.910
Frankie forgave me for that.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.245
That's one of the things
I love about Frankie.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.789
She's very forgiving.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.792
Yes, of course you can

11:08.794 --> 11:12.047
Grace, can I have your credit card?
We're adopting a snow leopard.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.174
I'm getting my roommate's credit card.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.888
Where is the thing
that turns these into toast?

11:22.474 --> 11:24.393
-It's here somewhere.
-Oh, God.

11:24.476 --> 11:25.936
The nightmare begins.

11:27.354 --> 11:32.943
The daily deluge of emails about
Gina Taylor-Tang's divorce have started,

11:33.026 --> 11:35.612
and so has my acid reflux.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.905
What is it this time?

11:36.988 --> 11:41.702
They seem to be taking
very strong stands about the silverware.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.871
Gina is willing to let him have
the shrimp fork--

11:44.955 --> 11:48.083
No, no, wait...
now he wants her to have them

11:48.166 --> 11:52.295
so, quote, "she will have something
to eat shrimp with in hell."

11:52.379 --> 11:55.715
Really? Is this how
I have to start my day?

11:57.884 --> 11:59.803
I'm watching a hummingbird.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.222
Wait...

12:03.515 --> 12:06.184
I'm watching a family of hummingbirds.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.979
-That's an omen.
-Of what?

12:09.646 --> 12:11.732
That we'll need to get
a hummingbird feeder.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.317
I could watch them all day.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.445
Then it's settled. We're staying home.

12:16.528 --> 12:17.487
What?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.699
You can watch them all day,
but not at the office.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.617
So, like you said,
we're staying home.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.078
-You said we're staying home.
-You said it again.

12:25.662 --> 12:26.580
Where are you going?

12:26.663 --> 12:29.332
To change into my stay-at-home clothes.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.460
Robert, we have to go to work.

12:31.543 --> 12:36.047
We don't have to do anything, but unpack
and buy that hummingbird feeder.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.341
Aren't we a little too old to play hooky?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.970
Not necessarily. Watch this.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.731
[in raspy voice]
Yes, hello, Bud? Yeah, it's Robert.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.859
Hey, listen, your dad and I
are not feeling so good.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.821
So... we'll come in if you really need us,

12:59.905 --> 13:02.157
but I'd advise everyone
to wear a face mask.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.242

-We have a meeting with Highsmith.
-Oh, great.

13:34.981 --> 13:38.151
Welcome to Partner'd.
I am Tim, your mood engineer.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.987
Oh, but no,
we're all full up on chunky jewelry.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.155
Speak for yourself.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.990
Oh, no. These are for laser tag,

13:44.074 --> 13:46.535
which we encourage you
to enjoy while you're waiting.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.245

-I'll tell Highsmith you're here.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.373
In the meantime, have a seat,
help yourself to room-temperature liquids.

Oh, well, maybe later.
We drank in the car.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.512
Let's get on our phones so we fit in.

14:05.595 --> 14:09.307
I pride myself on not fitting in,
but okay.

14:09.391 --> 14:10.850
So here's the plan.

14:10.934 --> 14:14.980
I'll talk first, and I'll keep talking,
and you don't talk.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.497
That's Highsmith.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.041
Oh! That's him.

14:35.584 --> 14:36.960
Come on, Frankie.

14:37.794 --> 14:41.715
Just remember, under no circumstances
do you bring up the condoms.

14:41.798 --> 14:45.135
Got it. Unless it comes up organically,
I do not bring up the condoms.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.888
This is an incubator.
One baby at a time.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.849
But when it's an incubator for chickens,
they have a whole bunch!

14:50.932 --> 14:55.145
This is an incubator for human babies,
one human baby.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.981
And stop with the damn chickens.

-I'm gonna say "no."
-We're fine, thank you.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.214
Does this bother you? It helps me think.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.175
-Not at all.
-It's a little annoying.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.301
Great. Ready when you are.

15:26.384 --> 15:30.388
[clears throat]
Well... as you may know,

15:30.472 --> 15:34.684
baby boomers are one of the most
under-served consumer demographics.

15:34.768 --> 15:35.852
I've heard that.

15:35.936 --> 15:39.940
And it's a demo made up of by far
more single women than single men.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.691
Makes sense. Makes sense.

15:41.775 --> 15:45.487
Single women in their 60s and 70s
are the fastest-growing segment

15:45.570 --> 15:46.780
of the adult population.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.531
-Really?
-Yes!

15:48.615 --> 15:52.953
And while their bodies may have changed,
their desire has not.

15:53.036 --> 15:57.123
We at Vybrant intend to make
the very first vibrator

15:57.207 --> 16:01.169
designed specifically
for the 60-plus woman's body.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.839
-That is fucking dope!
-All right! Agh!

-Yes, dope is fresh to death.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.558
We call them "Let Her Rip."

16:26.903 --> 16:29.698
And I want to bring you home
and have you organize my closets.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.658
Well, I'm very good at that.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.702

16:34.744 --> 16:37.205
-Why not?
-We don't make things here.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.916
We're disruptors.
We disrupt markets. We break shit.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.169
You break shit? How can you
break shit without making shit?

16:43.253 --> 16:45.964
We break other people's shit.
Like, taxis become Uber,

16:46.047 --> 16:50.385
or books become E-readers, or going
to the dermatologist becomes Rashy.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.345

-Yes! That's what we are too.

those freaking condoms?

17:29.924 --> 17:32.761

They don't make anything here.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.554

And now it's all "Poke 'n' Pull"
and "Let 'Em Rip"

17:42.479 --> 17:45.356
and our vibrator
has been kicked to the curb!

but I still do.

-No, you don't.

-Yeah.

22:19.839 --> 22:23.301
Usually I'm just out with the old,
in with the new, but this is different.

22:23.384 --> 22:26.345
It's like this pain in my...

22:26.929 --> 22:28.556
red blood thing.

22:30.308 --> 22:32.351
Thank you, I wasn't sure where it was.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.147
I just hate that I hurt him.

22:36.731 --> 22:40.735
Look, honey, if it wasn't right for you,
it wasn't right for anybody.

22:41.194 --> 22:43.279
Believe me, I've been through it.

22:45.823 --> 22:47.450
I needed to hear that. Thank you.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.206
-Oh, that woman has a cane.
-Oh, God.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.750
-Ma'am!
-Go around!

22:55.833 --> 22:58.086
Ma'am, it is not safe!

23:00.296 --> 23:01.130
She's okay.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.594
So, problems in vibrator land?

23:06.677 --> 23:10.389
Yeah. We can't raise the 75-Gs
we need for our prototype.

23:10.473 --> 23:13.393
Wait, what? My mom said you guys
were fielding loan offers.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.770
Well, your mom is a big, fat, skinny liar.

23:17.355 --> 23:18.981
She must be freaking out.

23:19.565 --> 23:20.483
Kind of.

23:21.359 --> 23:24.404
I guess I could get ten dollars
from every person I know.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.447
Do you think I know 7500 people?

23:27.323 --> 23:30.451
Or, instead of getting
a little money from a lot of people,

23:30.535 --> 23:33.246
you could get a lot of money
from one person. Your favorite person.

23:33.329 --> 23:36.457
Oh, I haven't talked
to Paul Reubens in years.

23:36.541 --> 23:39.377
No, me, Frankie.

23:41.379 --> 23:43.047
Oh, I can't ask you for that.

23:43.131 --> 23:45.967
You're not asking, I'm offering.
I'm kissing up, actually.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.260
On one condition:

23:47.343 --> 23:50.513
your partner can never know
that the money came from me.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.390
She would think it was pity,
and she doesn't do pity.

23:52.473 --> 23:53.808
True dat.

23:54.475 --> 23:57.728
[sighs]
You're really going to give us the money?

23:57.812 --> 24:00.106
Ooh, "give" is a strong word.

24:00.189 --> 24:05.153
I am going to heroically loan you
the money for purely selfish reasons.

24:05.236 --> 24:09.532
Clearly, I will be single at 70
and in dire need of a good vibrator.

24:09.615 --> 24:13.536
I will hand deliver one to you
on your 70th birthday.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.913
Won't you be really super dead?

24:15.997 --> 24:21.836
If they make the advances in cryogenics
I truly believe possible, no.

24:23.546 --> 24:24.964
Okay.

24:26.048 --> 24:28.384
Here. As a thank you...

24:28.467 --> 24:30.595
take whatever you can grab.

24:31.762 --> 24:34.015
There's not falafel in there again,
is there?

24:34.098 --> 24:35.808
No, I ate that.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.604
Oh, oh, oh, you don't want that.

24:43.107 --> 24:46.986
-Oh. Packet of butter?
-No, it's a condom.

24:47.069 --> 24:48.946
A couple loose candies and a condom.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.240
The complete contents
of my tenth grade purse.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.953
[groaning]

24:56.037 --> 24:58.456
Okay. Thank you.

24:58.539 --> 25:01.042
Okay, stop, Frankie. I'm good.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.669
Thanks again for the soup.

25:04.378 --> 25:05.421
It was delicious.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.506
You're welcome,
even though you don't deserve it.

25:07.590 --> 25:08.716
[chuckles]

25:08.799 --> 25:11.093
Next time you want to take a day off,
take a day off.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.262
I fell in a puddle
on my way to the soup place

25:13.346 --> 25:15.389
and saw Mom on a park bench
laughing at me.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.392
Your mom might be
the nicest person in the world,

25:18.476 --> 25:20.645
but she does love
watching people fall down.

25:20.728 --> 25:23.523
She claims she tried to warn me.
I am quite certain she did not.

25:24.023 --> 25:28.444
Hey, listen, Bud, we're sorry we left you
with that crazy Gina Taylor-Tang.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.696
Oh, she's tough, man.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.615
She does not suffer fools.

25:32.698 --> 25:36.994
But she's smart, and I'm pretty sure
she was happy with me when she left.

25:37.078 --> 25:38.913
Happy? Gina?

25:39.413 --> 25:41.624
-[phone dings]
-Well, that's the way Bud goes.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.626
Okay, she just texted me,
and "I'm not happy."

25:44.168 --> 25:46.087
That sounds more like her.

25:47.088 --> 25:48.339
We'll be back tomorrow.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.633
[Bud] Okay. Love you.

25:50.716 --> 25:51.926
[Sol] Love you.

25:56.764 --> 25:57.640
What's wrong?

25:57.723 --> 26:00.059
I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.

26:00.685 --> 26:02.562
He knows we're not sick.

26:03.104 --> 26:07.108
Although, I still have the neck brace
and crutches from my gardening accident.

26:07.191 --> 26:09.944
We could say
we took a tumble moving boxes.

26:10.027 --> 26:13.114
Sol, I don't know if I ever
want to go back to work again.

26:13.698 --> 26:14.740
What? Why?

26:14.824 --> 26:17.034
[sighs] It's no fun anymore.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.414
Do you remember when it was fun?

26:22.665 --> 26:24.000
It's fun being with you.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.502
Yes, but why do we
have to be together there?

26:27.795 --> 26:29.880
I've been thinking about this a lot.

26:30.548 --> 26:31.924
Dare I mention the "R" word?

26:32.008 --> 26:32.967
Racism?

26:33.050 --> 26:35.136
No, silly. Retirement.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.263
[softly] Oh.

26:38.306 --> 26:40.057
It must have crossed your mind.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.310
Apparently not as much
as it's crossed yours.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.562
If you don't wanna talk about it now,
it's all right.

26:44.645 --> 26:45.938
No, I...

26:46.605 --> 26:47.898
I've thought about it.

26:47.982 --> 26:49.233
And?

26:50.401 --> 26:52.445
-I'm not sure I'm ready.
-Hm.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.155
Is this really what you want?

26:54.864 --> 27:00.453
All I want is to be in this house
dancing in two different rooms with you.

27:03.706 --> 27:06.125
You might be the sweetest man
I've ever met.

27:07.501 --> 27:08.711
Might?

27:26.979 --> 27:27.980
-Hey!
-Hi.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.191
What you doing?

27:30.274 --> 27:33.486
Well, there's this thing
called Kickstarter.

27:33.569 --> 27:38.240
Sounds awful, but it's either that
or we sell Mallory's kids for the 75,000.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.951
[chuckles] Or we can just use this.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.704
Where did you get that money?

27:43.788 --> 27:45.289
Grace, I cannot lie to you.

27:45.373 --> 27:48.626
Do you remember that prince
who wrote to me from Nigeria?

27:48.709 --> 27:49.669
-[door opens]
-Um...

27:49.752 --> 27:51.420
Well, I was cleaning out my car--

27:51.504 --> 27:55.424
Hey. I just got a few more bags to get
from the truck and I can start cooking.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.301
Oh, can I help you with that?

27:57.385 --> 27:58.969
I got it.

28:05.476 --> 28:07.812
Jacob gave me the money.

28:08.562 --> 28:10.022
Get out of here.

28:10.106 --> 28:11.982
Yes, the check. Jacob gave it to me.

28:12.066 --> 28:13.442
He can afford that?

28:13.526 --> 28:15.361
Oh, please, he's loaded.

28:15.444 --> 28:16.904
Why do you think I'm with him?

28:16.987 --> 28:19.240
See? He doesn't hate you.

28:19.323 --> 28:22.118
He believes in us and he forgives you.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.119
He does?

28:23.202 --> 28:26.914
Yes, of course he does. And he's
terribly sorry about what he said.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.958
Oh, he shouldn't be.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.377
Well, he is,
but there's one stipulation:

28:31.460 --> 28:35.256
he wants us to use the money
for the vibrator.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.258
Our vibrator.

28:38.092 --> 28:41.137
It's okay to talk about the condoms.
I didn't mean to be so--

28:41.220 --> 28:43.431
-Impossible? I'm used to it.
-Well...

28:43.514 --> 28:44.932
I was gonna say "determined."

28:45.015 --> 28:47.059
-Well, I said "impossible" first.
-[door closes]

28:47.852 --> 28:50.354
But you're not.
You are a lady with a plan.

28:50.438 --> 28:53.482
A good plan that I believe in.

28:53.566 --> 28:56.068
-Where are you going?
-Well, I have to thank him.

28:56.152 --> 28:59.697
Oh, oh, you can't!
That's the other stipulation.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.074
I said there was one, but there's two.

29:02.158 --> 29:04.160
He doesn't like messy thank yous.

29:04.827 --> 29:07.830
You want Cheetos on your salad again,
because I bought them.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.251
Jacob.

29:12.334 --> 29:13.961
Oh, Jacob.

29:14.378 --> 29:15.504
Oh.

29:16.505 --> 29:20.134
[softly]
This is how a WASP apologizes. Go with it.
