WEBVTT

00:10.810 --> 00:13.110
I'm really contemplating
telling Elaine about Jeremy.

00:13.145 --> 00:14.415
My God, not this again, dude.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.187
We have a no-alcohol
office policy.

00:16.215 --> 00:17.759
- He should respect that.
- Yeah, yeah, I know,

00:17.783 --> 00:19.783
but you found a bottle of wine
under his desk

00:19.819 --> 00:22.089
at a Christmas party.

00:22.121 --> 00:24.261
Okay, I just think
in our line of work,

00:24.290 --> 00:25.690
it's pretty inappropriate.

00:28.461 --> 00:29.761
Okay, so,

00:29.795 --> 00:32.534
let's say HR receives
an anonymous tip

00:32.564 --> 00:35.335
about some vodka
in Jeremy's top drawer.

00:35.367 --> 00:36.367
Go on.

00:36.402 --> 00:37.742
Then, hypothetically,

00:37.770 --> 00:39.081
they'd do a routine search
of his desk

00:39.105 --> 00:40.105
and find a stash.

00:40.139 --> 00:41.379
A stash that you planted.

00:41.407 --> 00:42.451
Yeah, or he could be holding.

00:42.475 --> 00:43.518
I mean, you don't truly know

00:43.542 --> 00:46.412
anybody that you work with.

00:46.445 --> 00:48.545
I mean, look at you.

00:48.581 --> 00:51.381
I know those aren't
prescription lenses.

00:54.887 --> 00:57.127
Okay, well, I know what
this is actually about.

00:57.156 --> 00:59.456
You just want
a sweet corner office.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.436
Okay, his office is just
so much closer to the bathroom.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.100
- There it is.
- Yeah, and it would make

01:03.129 --> 01:04.159
field work a lot easier

01:04.196 --> 01:05.166
if I didn't have to go back

01:05.197 --> 01:06.697
to that fucking cubicle.

01:06.732 --> 01:08.276
Since when did you not like
being in the field?

01:08.300 --> 01:10.270
I thought you liked
traveling with me.

01:13.405 --> 01:15.175
- God.
- He's weak.

01:15.207 --> 01:16.785
Shit, I thought he wasn't
supposed to teleport.

01:16.809 --> 01:18.649
He's not.

01:18.677 --> 01:20.347
Bet he needs more Factor.

01:20.379 --> 01:21.519
Do we have enough?

01:21.547 --> 01:22.617
Yeah, back in the van.

01:22.648 --> 01:24.718
- Okay.
- All right.

01:28.821 --> 01:31.161
One, two, three, fold out.

01:33.726 --> 01:35.466
Okay. All right, all right.

01:37.630 --> 01:38.700
Okay.

01:40.933 --> 01:43.833
Yep.

01:48.607 --> 01:50.707
All right.

01:50.743 --> 01:53.213
Let's go.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:23.809 --> 02:24.779
Are you okay?

02:24.810 --> 02:26.910
Jenna!

02:28.881 --> 02:30.881
I think so.

02:30.916 --> 02:32.386
You?

02:32.418 --> 02:33.888
Yeah.

02:33.919 --> 02:36.319
He... he just...

02:36.355 --> 02:37.825
Yeah.

02:37.856 --> 02:39.556
He was in your room, Henry,

02:39.592 --> 02:42.332
when I came home.

02:42.361 --> 02:43.501
I saw him, too.

02:44.763 --> 02:45.933
Where? At... at the hospital?

02:45.965 --> 02:48.405
No.

02:48.434 --> 02:49.834
When I was a kid.

02:49.868 --> 02:51.638
It was at Dippy's house,

02:51.670 --> 02:53.370
but, like, before
it was Dippy's house,

02:53.405 --> 02:55.505
when it was my house,

02:55.541 --> 02:56.511
and my dad was there.

02:56.542 --> 02:57.882
W-when you were a kid?

02:57.910 --> 02:58.920
I don't... I don't understand.

02:58.944 --> 03:00.944
They were fighting,

03:00.980 --> 03:02.750
and my dad

03:02.781 --> 03:04.821
was trying to protect me,

03:04.850 --> 03:06.590
and he didn't leave.

03:06.619 --> 03:07.929
He didn't leave me.
He didn't leave my mom.

03:07.953 --> 03:10.353
That guy took him.

03:10.389 --> 03:12.759
He was the one who took him.

03:12.791 --> 03:14.391
And now he's after you.

03:15.995 --> 03:17.365
Yeah.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.610
Hey, it's... it's my dad.

03:32.645 --> 03:34.945
He's at the hospital.
What do I do?

03:34.980 --> 03:36.880
What if they saw you disappear?

03:36.915 --> 03:38.955
Jenna, I don't know.
Don't answer.

03:38.984 --> 03:40.554
- No, I really think...
- Jenna...

03:40.586 --> 03:41.663
I really think that
I should answer it.

03:41.687 --> 03:42.987
Jenna,

03:43.022 --> 03:45.862
look at this shit.

03:45.891 --> 03:47.691
How are we supposed to
explain this?

03:47.726 --> 03:49.026
We just...

03:49.061 --> 03:50.861
We're gonna...

03:50.896 --> 03:52.896
We will figure it out, okay?

03:52.931 --> 03:57.301
We're gonna start cleaning,
and we'll figure it out.

03:59.805 --> 04:00.875
Okay?

04:03.475 --> 04:04.775
Okay.

04:04.810 --> 04:06.610
Cleo, you shouldn't go in there.

04:06.645 --> 04:08.585
- Get away from me.
- Listen, you cannot be here.

04:08.614 --> 04:09.954
I'm serious right now.

04:09.982 --> 04:11.352
- The hell I can't.
- Listen to...

04:11.383 --> 04:12.623
Hey. Cleo.

04:12.651 --> 04:14.051
Cleo!

04:14.086 --> 04:15.756
- I tried to stop her.
- Did you know?

04:15.788 --> 04:16.865
Did you know what your son
did to my daughter?

04:16.889 --> 04:18.589
Look, this isn't...

04:18.624 --> 04:19.824
Let's discuss this later.

04:19.858 --> 04:20.928
Jesus, Bill.

04:20.959 --> 04:23.529
No, not about that!

04:23.562 --> 04:25.032
Look...

04:25.064 --> 04:27.664
Not until last night,
but I spoke with Clay,

04:27.700 --> 04:29.700
and I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

04:29.735 --> 04:31.375
A misunderstanding?

04:31.403 --> 04:33.603
Your son assaulted my daughter.

04:33.639 --> 04:35.579
Now, we don't know anything
to be sure.

04:35.607 --> 04:37.447
Excuse me?

04:37.476 --> 04:38.746
What did you say to her?

04:38.777 --> 04:40.577
Why is she scared of you?

04:40.612 --> 04:41.712
Scared of me? What's...

04:41.747 --> 04:43.547
Honestly, I have no idea.

04:43.582 --> 04:46.382
I have done everything
in my power to protect her.

04:46.418 --> 04:47.688
I would never hurt her.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.890
Protect her from what?

04:48.921 --> 04:50.861
Look, Cleo, Henrietta...

04:50.889 --> 04:52.559
It's Henry, not Henrietta.

04:52.591 --> 04:54.002
I'm sure that...
That helps you think of her

04:54.026 --> 04:54.996
as some delicate little girl,

04:55.027 --> 04:56.827
but it is Henry, okay?

04:56.862 --> 04:57.862
Okay.

04:57.896 --> 04:59.836
All right, fine. Henry.

04:59.865 --> 05:01.565
But look, I'm the one

05:01.600 --> 05:03.044
who's trying to make
this right, even now.

05:03.068 --> 05:05.368
Tell me you didn't
hire me to shut her up.

05:05.404 --> 05:06.548
To keep your kid out of jail.

05:06.572 --> 05:08.612
No, of course not. I told you...

05:08.640 --> 05:10.719
You think because you've
got money and police friends,

05:10.743 --> 05:12.713
you can buy your way
out of hurting my daughter?

05:12.745 --> 05:14.485
No way. No fucking way.

05:14.513 --> 05:16.883
I'm not scared of you
and your stupid auto center,

05:16.915 --> 05:19.485
folksy businessman
of America bullshit.

05:19.518 --> 05:20.762
All right, Mrs. Coles,
it's time for you to leave.

05:20.786 --> 05:22.486
Get your hands off me!

05:22.521 --> 05:23.791
This isn't your problem, Dale.

05:23.822 --> 05:24.833
We both know that's not true.

05:24.857 --> 05:25.927
Don't make this worse.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.628
What are you even doing here?

05:32.931 --> 05:34.401
What's going on?

05:34.433 --> 05:36.703
Listen, Cleo,
I'll come by the house later

05:36.735 --> 05:38.975
and explain everything.

05:39.004 --> 05:41.004
Lucas, escort Cleo
out of the building.

05:41.039 --> 05:42.599
Come on, just...
Cleo, come on, come on.

05:44.042 --> 05:45.482
What is going on?

05:46.612 --> 05:47.612
Bill!

05:49.982 --> 05:51.722
You look good, Lucas.

05:51.750 --> 05:54.120
Glad to see it.

05:54.153 --> 05:57.753
I don't believe
we've had the pleasure, ma'am.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.990
She's a new employee
at the auto center.

06:00.025 --> 06:01.095
Don't worry.

06:01.126 --> 06:03.796
You can trust her.

06:03.829 --> 06:05.039
I think it's time for me to go.

06:05.063 --> 06:06.603
I don't think that's wise
just now.

06:09.735 --> 06:10.935
Don't you agree, Bill?

06:12.838 --> 06:14.808
You're gonna have to
stay with us for a while now.

06:17.609 --> 06:19.579
All right, come on.

06:19.611 --> 06:21.911
Just get back here.

06:21.947 --> 06:24.087
Let's get down to business,
shall we?

06:45.871 --> 06:47.171
Deputy Hulce.

06:47.206 --> 06:50.146
Aren't you a little close?

06:50.175 --> 06:52.715
Hiding in plain sight. Get in.

06:59.551 --> 07:01.991
As a reminder, you're here
as a friend of the DEA

07:02.020 --> 07:04.760
and not in any official
capacity an officer of the law.

07:04.790 --> 07:06.130
Understood.

07:06.158 --> 07:07.498
Your sidearm.

07:07.526 --> 07:08.866
You're kidding.

07:08.894 --> 07:11.064
DEA protocol.

07:13.098 --> 07:14.598
There's a headset for you.

07:14.633 --> 07:16.473
Coffee's a little cold,
but it still works.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.572
I'm good.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.582
Get comfortable. There's always
a fair amount of dick-measuring

07:20.606 --> 07:22.646
before these assholes
get down to it.

07:25.244 --> 07:28.114
Maybe you could help us
with an ID.

07:28.146 --> 07:30.516
Tall blonde in the back?
She's not in our files.

07:30.549 --> 07:32.889
Just started seeing her
around Boone Motors recently.

07:37.055 --> 07:39.855
That's Cleo Coles.

07:39.892 --> 07:42.232
She's a sales rep
at the dealership.

07:42.261 --> 07:43.861
Total bystander.

07:43.896 --> 07:45.666
So she works with Bill?

07:45.697 --> 07:46.997
On the dealership side.

07:47.032 --> 07:49.072
She's not part of
the drug business.

07:53.138 --> 07:55.238
Got a positive ID on Barbie.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.614
New employee.
All teams stand by.

07:57.643 --> 08:01.013
Can we get her out of there?

08:01.046 --> 08:03.216
Jeremiah Miller just arrived.

08:03.248 --> 08:05.788
We're not doing anything
until we see cash and drugs.

08:59.805 --> 09:01.145
Hi, sweetheart.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.573
It's me.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.248
Um,

09:04.276 --> 09:08.046
I'm sitting with you now
at the hospital and...

09:08.080 --> 09:09.580
I don't know, I just...

09:09.615 --> 09:11.055
I wanted to hear your voice.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.083
That's all.

09:13.118 --> 09:14.718
I'm gonna keep calling you.

09:22.794 --> 09:23.994
Hi, sweetheart.

09:24.029 --> 09:25.899
It's me.

09:25.931 --> 09:27.671
Um,

09:27.699 --> 09:30.899
I'm sitting with you now
at the hospital and...

09:30.936 --> 09:32.136
I don't know., I just...

09:32.170 --> 09:33.870
I wanted to hear your voice.

09:33.905 --> 09:36.305
That's all.

09:49.888 --> 09:52.928
All right. Oof!

09:52.958 --> 09:54.928
And here we go.

09:57.162 --> 10:00.762
You stitching me up
with a machete back there?

10:00.799 --> 10:02.839
Almost done, sir.

10:02.868 --> 10:05.068
Um, she's not in
her sunniest of moods,

10:05.103 --> 10:07.003
but she'd like to talk to you.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.979
Hey. If there's a free moment,

10:09.007 --> 10:11.077
could you mention how well
we did intercepting you?

10:11.109 --> 10:13.909
We could use the high marks
for our promotion, so...

10:13.945 --> 10:15.985
Give me the fucking phone.

10:19.918 --> 10:21.358
Yeah? You'd be dead

10:21.386 --> 10:23.256
if my team hadn't
tracked you down.

10:23.288 --> 10:24.658
I'm aware.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.230
What the hell happened?

10:26.258 --> 10:28.828
I need to know if,
any of my previous targets

10:28.860 --> 10:31.000
had a daughter named
Henrietta Coles.

10:31.029 --> 10:33.669
There's no evidence
to support hereditary links.

10:43.942 --> 10:46.012
Besides, those files
are classified.

10:46.044 --> 10:47.844
Well, de-fucking-classify them,
then.

10:47.879 --> 10:50.079
Listen, I get it. You're tired.

10:50.115 --> 10:52.115
We'll search the database,
if that's what you want,

10:52.150 --> 10:54.750
but I need you back
in Reston right away.

10:54.786 --> 10:55.826
All right.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.237
You gonna count it?

11:13.271 --> 11:15.171
Money isn't necessary.

11:18.043 --> 11:19.913
What are you talking about?

11:19.945 --> 11:22.745
These are gifts, free of charge.

11:25.417 --> 11:27.017
Is this some kind of a joke?

11:35.160 --> 11:38.000
It may come as a surprise
to you, Bill, but I...

11:38.029 --> 11:40.399
I rarely joke.

11:40.432 --> 11:41.932
What's going on here?

11:43.969 --> 11:45.839
After many fruitful years,

11:45.871 --> 11:48.011
we've come to the end of
the road.

11:48.039 --> 11:51.339
I began this business
in service of my community

11:51.376 --> 11:55.146
and my family,
not at the cost of them.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.022
All fields fallow in time.

11:59.050 --> 12:00.790
We will no longer
need your services.

12:04.222 --> 12:05.462
What the hell is going on?

12:05.490 --> 12:07.390
This gift is a farewell,

12:07.425 --> 12:10.325
and we only want one thing
in return.

12:12.564 --> 12:15.064
Honesty.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.300
I want to admit that you

12:17.335 --> 12:18.905
and your boy here

12:18.937 --> 12:20.377
killed my son.

12:37.322 --> 12:38.562
We need to move now.

12:38.590 --> 12:40.390
Luis signaled to wait.

12:40.425 --> 12:41.865
We need an exchange, Deputy.

12:41.893 --> 12:43.263
Without money changing hands,

12:43.295 --> 12:44.305
all we've got
are border violations

12:44.329 --> 12:45.499
and armed possession.

12:45.530 --> 12:47.500
Jeremiah is not here
for an exchange.

12:47.532 --> 12:49.172
Lucas Boone murdered his son.

12:49.201 --> 12:50.841
This is revenge.

12:50.869 --> 12:52.213
It's about to turn into
a bloodbath.

12:52.237 --> 12:53.314
There are innocent lives
in there!

12:53.338 --> 12:55.978
We move when Luis calls it in.

13:16.127 --> 13:17.527
Jenna?

13:29.107 --> 13:31.307
I cleaned everything up.

13:31.343 --> 13:34.313
But there's a crack
in one of the picture frames

13:34.346 --> 13:36.324
and the blood's not coming out,
but maybe if we just,

13:36.348 --> 13:37.988
you know,
let it soak for a minute.

13:38.016 --> 13:39.160
You know, we could try
bleaching it.

13:39.184 --> 13:40.361
I mean, it might hurt the rug,

13:40.385 --> 13:42.325
but bleach is easier to...

13:42.354 --> 13:44.354
It's easier to explain
than blood, and...

13:47.225 --> 13:49.065
What a...

13:49.094 --> 13:51.134
I can do it.

14:01.072 --> 14:03.242
Doesn't it hurt?

14:04.643 --> 14:08.143
Keeping everything inside?

14:08.179 --> 14:10.279
I mean, I'm...

14:10.315 --> 14:11.655
I don't know if that means

14:11.683 --> 14:14.883
I'm weaker, but

14:14.920 --> 14:17.360
I'm not sure if it's
strength, what you're doing.

14:21.159 --> 14:23.559
What are you talking about?

14:23.595 --> 14:26.535
I mean, I d... I just
stabbed a guy

14:26.564 --> 14:29.964
and spent, like, a half-hour

14:30.001 --> 14:31.641
cleaning the blood
out of our rug,

14:31.670 --> 14:33.170
but you're just washing
the dishes,

14:33.204 --> 14:34.415
like it's any other
day of the week.

14:34.439 --> 14:35.979
Jenna, I'm...

14:36.007 --> 14:38.107
Aren't you scared?

14:38.143 --> 14:39.643
I am.

14:39.678 --> 14:41.648
I am really fucking scared,
Henry,

14:41.680 --> 14:45.020
and you just want to pretend
like none of this happened.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.350
That's not true...

14:46.384 --> 14:48.924
No, like Clay never hurt you,

14:48.954 --> 14:50.294
like you didn't just teleport

14:50.322 --> 14:52.522
out of a hospital,
like there isn't

14:52.557 --> 14:54.427
something wrong with you,
but there is!

14:54.459 --> 14:56.459
There is something
really wrong with you.

14:56.494 --> 15:00.034
Jesus, Jenna, I know!

15:00.065 --> 15:02.665
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to cry?

15:02.701 --> 15:05.441
Do you want me to run to my mom?

15:05.470 --> 15:07.270
What do you think
she's gonna do?

15:07.305 --> 15:08.616
Do you think that she's
gonna want to just stay here,

15:08.640 --> 15:10.680
where all of this shit
has happened?

15:13.078 --> 15:15.118
She fucking likes it here.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.734
I told your mom.

15:31.763 --> 15:34.003
About Clay.

15:35.467 --> 15:37.707
What?

15:37.736 --> 15:41.576
Do you remember
what you said to her?

15:41.606 --> 15:44.446
Before your seizure?

15:44.476 --> 15:46.516
Henry, you...

15:46.544 --> 15:48.584
You started to tell her
the truth.

15:52.083 --> 15:55.023
And she asked me if I
knew anything about it,

15:55.053 --> 15:56.253
and I...

15:56.287 --> 15:59.427
No.

15:59.457 --> 16:01.497
That wasn't yours to tell.

16:10.268 --> 16:12.508
It's my dad.
I can't just keep ignoring him.

16:12.537 --> 16:13.637
Just answer it.

16:13.671 --> 16:15.511
And say what?

16:15.540 --> 16:16.580
I don't know.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.678
Tell him that I woke up,

16:18.710 --> 16:22.250
I got scared, I came home,
and I'm fine now.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.220
So lie again for you?

16:25.250 --> 16:28.550
You know, you act like
you don't have any secrets.

16:28.586 --> 16:30.386
What's that supposed to mean?

16:35.493 --> 16:37.093
Just do whatever you want.

16:37.128 --> 16:38.728
You clearly do anyway.

16:47.839 --> 16:49.709
Hi, Dad. Jenna.

16:49.741 --> 16:52.241
Listen to me. Henry is missing.

16:52.277 --> 16:54.617
You know, maybe she's
wandering around the hospital.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.657
I-I really don't know. Nobody knows.
Dad, slow down.

16:56.681 --> 16:58.492
Maybe she woke up in
the room when I wasn't there.

16:58.516 --> 17:00.094
I mean, I should have been
there, but I wasn't,

17:00.118 --> 17:01.662
and I promised Cleo.
I promised your mom,

17:01.686 --> 17:03.264
and now nobody has any idea
where the hell she is.

17:03.288 --> 17:06.127
No, Dad, it's okay.

17:06.156 --> 17:07.127
She's here.

17:07.157 --> 17:08.397
She... what?

17:08.425 --> 17:09.425
What?

17:09.461 --> 17:11.361
Yeah, she's at the house.

17:11.396 --> 17:13.096
She woke up and got scared

17:13.131 --> 17:14.631
and... I don't know.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.143
I think somebody
may have dropped her off.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.037
I don't know, but she's here.
She's okay.

17:19.637 --> 17:20.837
Okay.

17:20.872 --> 17:23.172
And you didn't think to

17:23.208 --> 17:25.108
pick up the phone
and tell me this?

17:25.143 --> 17:26.242
Hell, I've been calling

17:26.277 --> 17:27.817
and calling and calling.

17:27.846 --> 17:29.546
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Do you have any idea

17:29.581 --> 17:30.758
how worried everybody is here?

17:30.782 --> 17:32.482
I got doctors and nurses.

17:32.517 --> 17:34.287
They are scouring
this entire hospital.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.319
This is insane,
and I do not believe you.

17:36.354 --> 17:37.794
You, of all people,

17:37.822 --> 17:39.592
with everything that happened
with your mom,

17:39.624 --> 17:42.664
you should know how important
it is to call.

17:42.694 --> 17:45.294
Y-you're right. Um...

17:45.330 --> 17:47.100
I'm really sorry, Dad.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.532
And what am I
supposed to tell Cleo

17:49.567 --> 17:51.167
when she calls now?

17:51.202 --> 17:52.772
Isn't she at
the hospital with you?

17:52.804 --> 17:54.544
No, she left.
Said she had something

17:54.572 --> 17:56.172
to do for Henry.

17:56.207 --> 17:57.847
And I called, like,
a dozen times.

17:57.876 --> 17:59.353
- Nothing.
- What do you... what do you mean?

17:59.377 --> 18:01.217
Hi! Excuse me, hi!

18:01.246 --> 18:03.886
Yeah?

18:03.915 --> 18:05.415
I know where Henry is.

18:05.450 --> 18:06.790
And my daughter.

18:06.818 --> 18:08.688
Just give me a sec.
I gotta go deal with this,

18:08.720 --> 18:10.390
and I will talk to you
when I get home.

18:10.421 --> 18:11.891
Did he say she left?

18:11.923 --> 18:13.663
- Why would she leave?
- I don't know.

18:13.691 --> 18:15.202
He said she needed to
do something for me?

18:15.226 --> 18:16.226
What does that mean?

18:18.329 --> 18:20.499
Jenna, what exactly
did you tell her?

18:20.532 --> 18:22.872
I-I told you.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.345
She was beating herself up
for not knowing

18:24.369 --> 18:27.209
what was happening to you.

18:27.238 --> 18:29.908
She just needed to understand.

18:29.941 --> 18:30.911
What?

18:30.942 --> 18:32.542
What Clay did to me?

18:35.480 --> 18:37.850
Yeah.

18:37.882 --> 18:41.652
That, and... Bill.

18:41.686 --> 18:43.656
I told her that you were
afraid of him.

18:45.823 --> 18:47.893
Why? Why? Why would you do that?

18:47.926 --> 18:50.626
Because you are! Okay?

18:50.662 --> 18:52.902
You won't tell me why,
but I... I know that you are.

18:52.931 --> 18:55.731
Jenna, I don't... I wouldn't...
I wouldn't tell you

18:55.767 --> 18:58.937
because you do shit like
this, Jenna! Fuck!

18:58.970 --> 19:00.510
Shit.

19:00.538 --> 19:02.278
Henry.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.817
Henry, we thought you were
going to die, okay?

19:03.841 --> 19:05.781
And your mom... she was...

19:05.810 --> 19:08.280
She was asking me questions,
and she deserved answers.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.523
- What are you doing?
- I need your keys.

19:09.547 --> 19:10.917
- Why?
- Because my mom is off

19:10.949 --> 19:12.619
to pick a fight with
Bill fucking Boone

19:12.650 --> 19:14.290
because of some shit
that you said!

19:16.721 --> 19:18.421
Okay, well, I'm...
I'm coming with you!

19:20.525 --> 19:23.625
Well, you got some balls on you,

19:23.661 --> 19:25.731
coming in here and making
false accusations.

19:25.763 --> 19:28.303
They're not false, Bill.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.433
We found Amos' Bible
in your son's bedroom.

19:34.272 --> 19:36.272
You broke into my house?

19:36.307 --> 19:38.877
Even you had to admit
how strange it is he died here.

19:38.910 --> 19:40.780
That demanded inquiry,

19:40.812 --> 19:41.982
which paid off.

19:43.514 --> 19:44.725
I don't even know what the hell

19:44.749 --> 19:47.619
you think this Bible proves.

19:47.652 --> 19:49.322
It proves

19:49.354 --> 19:51.254
that your son was with Amos

19:51.289 --> 19:52.329
before he died.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.297
He's probably the last one...

19:56.628 --> 19:58.668
Probably the last one
who saw him alive.

20:00.531 --> 20:02.231
Well, shit, Jeremiah.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.667
You've been living on that farm
so damn long,

20:04.702 --> 20:06.242
I don't think you realize

20:06.271 --> 20:07.514
that what you're
throwing around here

20:07.538 --> 20:09.438
is a hell of a lot
of conjecture.

20:09.474 --> 20:11.844
- Isn't that right?
- Yeah, I didn't do anything.

20:11.876 --> 20:12.846
I get it.

20:12.877 --> 20:15.377
I get it. I do.

20:15.413 --> 20:17.491
You wanted to believe your son
was stronger than he was,

20:17.515 --> 20:20.485
but please, that doesn't mean
that you have to

20:20.518 --> 20:23.588
take my boy down with him.

20:31.329 --> 20:32.899
I will give you this one chance

20:32.930 --> 20:35.900
for atonement.

20:35.933 --> 20:38.403
Get down on your knees,

20:38.436 --> 20:39.976
confess to murdering my son,

20:40.004 --> 20:42.304
and beg for forgiveness.

20:42.340 --> 20:43.810
From Amos,

20:43.841 --> 20:46.511
from my wife, from God.

20:49.647 --> 20:51.947
I'm not doing that.

20:56.988 --> 21:01.028
I will do it with you.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.059
Beg for my own forgiveness.

21:07.732 --> 21:09.972
Dear Lord, we pray

21:10.001 --> 21:11.741
for all the hurt

21:11.769 --> 21:13.609
all the pain, all the sorrow,

21:13.638 --> 21:15.578
that we caused our community

21:15.606 --> 21:16.946
and our families. Please, Bill.

21:16.974 --> 21:18.474
- Do it with me. Bill!
- Stop.

21:18.509 --> 21:19.879
Do it!

21:23.414 --> 21:24.854
So you do not feel my pain.

21:24.882 --> 21:27.082
Get up.
You're embarrassing yourself.

21:29.654 --> 21:31.554
You don't think
I've suffered enough?

21:33.091 --> 21:34.861
I've got nothing to atone for.

21:36.427 --> 21:38.027
Your son crippled my boy.

21:38.062 --> 21:39.702
He put Clay
in that fucking chair

21:39.731 --> 21:41.331
for the rest of his life!

21:41.366 --> 21:43.066
What?

21:43.101 --> 21:44.401
Amos? What?

21:44.435 --> 21:45.905
Stop.

21:45.937 --> 21:47.777
Truly, Bill, my son

21:47.805 --> 21:49.083
- would never do such a sur...
- Her daughter was there!

21:49.107 --> 21:50.977
She saw everything.

21:51.008 --> 21:52.678
What?

21:52.710 --> 21:54.810
She pointed out Amos to me.

21:54.846 --> 21:56.486
She said he was the one
who did it.

21:56.514 --> 21:57.754
You brought Henry into this?

21:57.782 --> 21:59.482
I was protecting our kids.

21:59.517 --> 22:00.957
He attacked Clay and Henrietta.

22:00.985 --> 22:02.755
I told her I'd protect her,
and I meant it!

22:02.787 --> 22:04.687
This girl lied to you, Bill.

22:04.722 --> 22:07.122
My son would never do
such a thing.

22:07.158 --> 22:09.728
I swear on my life.

22:09.761 --> 22:12.731
What about the shipment
my driver lost?

22:12.764 --> 22:15.034
It was retribution.
You took the money.

22:15.066 --> 22:16.636
We didn't even know about that

22:16.667 --> 22:18.707
until you offered our money
back to us!

22:22.640 --> 22:24.910
What have you done?

22:24.942 --> 22:28.012
All of this...
This is built on delusion.

22:28.045 --> 22:31.085
Where is this girl now?
I want to speak with her!

22:31.115 --> 22:32.785
Pop, I told you she lied to you.

22:32.817 --> 22:34.417
- Lucas, stop.
- She fucking lied. No.

22:34.452 --> 22:35.963
No, this is over.
This is over right now.

22:35.987 --> 22:37.631
We don't even know if
he's telling the truth!

22:37.655 --> 22:39.695
Yes, we do!

22:39.724 --> 22:41.764
Henry made it up
to get you off her ass

22:41.793 --> 22:45.593
because... 'cause you
scared the shit out of her.

22:45.630 --> 22:48.030
And

22:48.065 --> 22:50.865
look, Amos didn't...

22:50.902 --> 22:54.702
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

23:13.658 --> 23:16.528
And he always called you
the weak one.

23:16.561 --> 23:17.901
- Wait!
- Shit!

23:17.929 --> 23:19.529
Gun!

23:22.467 --> 23:23.937
Shit! Move in! Move in!

23:23.968 --> 23:25.208
Deputy, wait!

23:25.236 --> 23:26.936
You are clear to breach.

23:34.812 --> 23:38.452
Position!

23:40.952 --> 23:43.022
I need more ammo!

23:49.126 --> 23:50.766
Brendan!

24:02.139 --> 24:03.709
Cleo, stay down!

24:03.741 --> 24:05.741
Okay.

24:10.748 --> 24:11.888
Come on! Go!

24:16.187 --> 24:19.487
Are you okay?
You're not hurt? Okay.

24:19.524 --> 24:21.124
- I'm hit!
- What?

24:21.158 --> 24:22.998
Follow me and stay close.

24:27.765 --> 24:29.205
Shit!

24:30.635 --> 24:31.935
Okay, go. Run.

24:31.969 --> 24:33.569
Okay.

24:36.874 --> 24:39.514
Go!

24:43.814 --> 24:46.014
Get down! Get down!

24:56.694 --> 24:58.094
Okay, get in.

24:58.129 --> 24:59.569
- What is it?
- You'll be safe.

24:59.597 --> 25:00.767
Just keep your head down.

25:06.170 --> 25:07.610
Stop!

25:07.638 --> 25:10.238
Drop the bag.

25:10.274 --> 25:11.714
Turn around!

25:13.144 --> 25:14.814
I... shit!

25:14.845 --> 25:15.845
Oof!

25:30.161 --> 25:32.701
Hey! Hey!

25:32.730 --> 25:34.230
Hey!

25:34.265 --> 25:35.305
Hey, move over! My God!

25:35.333 --> 25:36.703
Move the fuck over right now!

25:36.734 --> 25:37.974
Move! Please, no, Lucas!

25:54.318 --> 25:57.158
Lucas, don't!

25:57.188 --> 25:58.628
My God!

25:59.857 --> 26:00.997
My God.

26:01.025 --> 26:03.625
My God.

26:18.909 --> 26:21.349
DEA! Drop your weapons!

26:21.379 --> 26:23.119
Hands up! Freeze!

26:23.147 --> 26:24.992
Let me see your hands!
Drop your weapons right now!

26:25.016 --> 26:26.756
- You, don't move!
- That's it, easy!

26:26.784 --> 26:28.084
Hands behind your back!

26:28.119 --> 26:29.262
Okay, okay, put your hands
down right now!

26:29.286 --> 26:32.126
Face on the floor!

26:34.091 --> 26:37.191
It's over, Bill.

26:37.228 --> 26:39.398
Easy.

26:39.430 --> 26:41.370
Get down on your knees!

26:45.403 --> 26:47.843
Hey, hey, hey! Don't move!

27:03.688 --> 27:05.428
My God. That's my mom's car.

27:05.456 --> 27:07.996
Henry, I think we should
stay in the car. Henry!

27:13.698 --> 27:15.398
Mom!

27:15.433 --> 27:17.173
- Hey, stop, stop.
- Mom!

27:17.201 --> 27:20.001
Henry?

27:20.037 --> 27:21.677
Where's my mom?
It's fine, it's fine.

27:21.706 --> 27:23.946
Listen to me.

27:23.974 --> 27:25.414
We were right about Lucas

27:25.443 --> 27:28.013
and what he did to Amos Miller.

27:28.045 --> 27:30.715
And whatever Bill had you do,

27:30.748 --> 27:32.018
we got him.

27:32.049 --> 27:34.849
We got Bill Boone.

27:34.885 --> 27:37.285
Is my mom here?
Can I talk to her?

27:41.792 --> 27:44.292
- What?
- She's with Lucas.

27:44.328 --> 27:46.928
What? What does that mean?

27:46.964 --> 27:48.734
He took her.

27:51.302 --> 27:53.702
Okay, where?
Where did he take her?

27:53.738 --> 27:56.038
We're not sure yet.

27:56.073 --> 27:57.473
Are you fucking serious?

27:57.508 --> 27:59.008
But we have an APB out,

27:59.043 --> 28:00.253
and we are going
to find her, okay?

28:00.277 --> 28:01.717
How?

28:01.746 --> 28:02.776
How do you know that?

28:02.813 --> 28:03.890
You don't... you don't know that.

28:03.914 --> 28:05.054
I don't think Lucas has

28:05.082 --> 28:06.852
any intention of hurting
your mom.

28:06.884 --> 28:08.854
You just told me
he killed someone!

28:10.454 --> 28:11.994
Fuck... shit.

28:12.022 --> 28:14.022
Henry, where are you... Henry!

28:29.206 --> 28:32.046
Fuck!

28:32.076 --> 28:36.746
It's okay. Let's just...

28:36.781 --> 28:38.091
Is here anywhere in particular
that you're headed?

28:38.115 --> 28:40.915
I don't know! I...

28:40.951 --> 28:42.921
Okay, how about we...
We head back to town?

28:42.953 --> 28:44.293
No!

28:44.321 --> 28:45.791
Lucas,

28:45.823 --> 28:47.134
I need to get back
to the hospital.

28:47.158 --> 28:48.428
I need to get back to Henry.

28:48.459 --> 28:49.999
Yeah, then why did
you leave her?

28:50.027 --> 28:51.797
What?

28:51.829 --> 28:53.899
Why didn't you just stay
at the hospital?

28:53.931 --> 28:55.408
Why'd you have to come running
back in the dealership like that?

28:55.432 --> 28:57.272
I was just about to
get the fuck out of there,

28:57.301 --> 28:59.471
and then you made me
go back in, you made it worse.

28:59.503 --> 29:00.943
And I told you that, too,

29:00.971 --> 29:02.082
but you wouldn't listen to me.

29:02.106 --> 29:04.476
Nobody fucking listens to me!

29:04.508 --> 29:06.148
He never listened to me, never.

29:06.177 --> 29:07.788
If he would've just
fucking listened to me,

29:07.812 --> 29:09.812
we wouldn't have
all this fucking bullshit.

29:09.847 --> 29:11.424
Dead people everywhere...
Did you see that shit?

29:11.448 --> 29:12.518
Like, what the fuck?

29:12.550 --> 29:15.020
And yes, I messed up, okay?

29:15.052 --> 29:16.463
I did, but how am I supposed
to know the real shit

29:16.487 --> 29:18.187
when everybody keeps
fucking lying to me?

29:18.222 --> 29:19.462
Okay.

29:19.490 --> 29:20.860
Listen to me, honey.

29:20.891 --> 29:22.831
Will you listen to me?

29:22.860 --> 29:24.560
What?

29:24.595 --> 29:28.535
Listen, we're gonna just... let's
turn around, let's go back.

29:28.566 --> 29:31.136
We're not going back.

29:40.578 --> 29:42.578
What... what's wrong?

29:42.613 --> 29:44.053
Are you okay?

29:44.081 --> 29:47.021
You were right.

29:47.051 --> 29:48.528
I should've told her.
I should've fucking told her.

29:48.552 --> 29:50.122
She would've never come here.

29:50.154 --> 29:52.294
She would've known
not to fucking come here!

29:52.323 --> 29:55.963
Who? Your mom?

29:55.993 --> 29:58.863
I got a kid killed, Jenna.

29:58.896 --> 30:00.996
A kid's fucking dead,
and it's my fault.

30:04.268 --> 30:05.608
And now Lucas Boone

30:05.636 --> 30:07.306
just drove off with my mom.

30:07.338 --> 30:08.582
I mean, he just
fucking took her,

30:08.606 --> 30:10.116
and nobody knows
where the hell they are,

30:10.140 --> 30:12.910
and I don't...

30:12.943 --> 30:16.413
I don't know what to do! You...

30:16.447 --> 30:17.987
You fucking just tell me
what to do?

30:18.015 --> 30:21.355
I don't know what to do.

30:21.385 --> 30:22.455
I'm gonna call Clay.

30:22.486 --> 30:23.856
What? No.

30:23.888 --> 30:24.988
It's his brother, and Lucas

30:25.022 --> 30:26.262
might've taken your mom there,

30:26.290 --> 30:28.330
or maybe Clay knows
where he'd take her.

30:28.359 --> 30:30.399
Jenna, he's not going to
tell you shit.

30:30.427 --> 30:32.997
We'll make him.

31:17.975 --> 31:19.475
Mr. Boone, I'm Deputy...

31:19.510 --> 31:22.110
I know who you are,
Deputy Hulce.

31:22.146 --> 31:24.186
I guess you would.

31:24.214 --> 31:26.914
I told Dale to keep
an eye on you.

31:26.951 --> 31:28.651
Well, he should've listened.

31:28.686 --> 31:31.186
What makes you think he didn't?

31:31.221 --> 31:32.691
You,

31:32.723 --> 31:34.293
sitting there,

31:34.325 --> 31:36.325
handcuffed.

31:37.494 --> 31:40.034
You got a smirk on your face.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.934
Well, that's a perk
I rarely get to enjoy.

31:42.967 --> 31:46.207
Excuse us, Deputy.
Okay, Mr. Boone,

31:46.236 --> 31:48.176
we're gonna need to get
that wire back from you.

31:48.205 --> 31:51.005
Never should've gotten
that messy.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.285
Well, as long as you get
my boy Lucas back,

31:52.309 --> 31:53.579
it'll all be worth it.

31:53.610 --> 31:55.310
Right.

31:55.346 --> 31:57.123
Come on, gotta get you
processed and released.

31:57.147 --> 31:59.517
What is this?
You're not letting him go.

32:02.119 --> 32:05.059
What the fuck, Luis?

32:05.089 --> 32:07.129
The Millers were always
our primary target.

32:07.157 --> 32:08.357
- But...
- Look.

32:08.392 --> 32:09.636
Look, you're not the only person

32:09.660 --> 32:10.704
that told us about this meet.

32:10.728 --> 32:12.098
Bill set it up.

32:12.129 --> 32:14.299
The whole case against Jeremiah.

32:14.331 --> 32:16.001
Even handed us a bunch of
dirty cops.

32:16.033 --> 32:19.303
Hell, you'll probably
get a promotion.

32:19.336 --> 32:21.006
So he walks?

32:21.038 --> 32:22.008
Full immunity?

32:22.039 --> 32:24.009
Probation, time served.

32:24.041 --> 32:25.341
But what about Lucas Boone?

32:25.376 --> 32:26.486
He's got an innocent woman
with him.

32:26.510 --> 32:28.510
You know we have an APB out.

32:28.545 --> 32:29.985
We'll find them.

32:30.014 --> 32:32.484
Take today as a win.

32:32.516 --> 32:33.686
Trust me.

32:41.792 --> 32:44.392
Devil always catches up?

32:44.428 --> 32:45.668
What does that mean?

32:45.696 --> 32:47.566
Well, my stepdad is a pastor.

32:47.598 --> 32:49.138
Pretty big one, too.

32:49.166 --> 32:50.443
Like, he's got a microphone
and shit,

32:50.467 --> 32:52.567
and he's always
saying stuff like.

32:52.603 --> 32:56.743
"Strong men have to take care
of the weak, because..."

32:56.774 --> 32:58.314
I don't know. Because some...

32:58.342 --> 33:00.242
Look, I... I tried to be strong.

33:00.277 --> 33:02.017
I really, really tried.

33:02.046 --> 33:03.416
I tried to take care of
my brother

33:03.447 --> 33:06.447
and my dad, but it all got
so messed up!

33:09.586 --> 33:13.596
You don't always have to be
the strong man, Lucas.

33:13.624 --> 33:15.724
You know, when I came home
that night,

33:15.759 --> 33:17.329
I told him what I did.

33:17.361 --> 33:19.161
I mean, he asked me to do it,

33:19.196 --> 33:21.466
but the look on his face
was like...

33:24.268 --> 33:26.068
It's like I wasn't even me
he was looking at.

33:26.103 --> 33:28.373
Like I was my brother,
you know, like I was Clay.

33:28.405 --> 33:32.615
He was... He was so proud of me.

33:32.643 --> 33:34.783
Isn't that fucked up?

33:34.812 --> 33:36.782
Yeah.

33:42.820 --> 33:46.260
That man at the

33:46.290 --> 33:48.460
dealership with the hat...

33:53.363 --> 33:55.563
I killed his son.

34:00.771 --> 34:02.541
God, I thought I was
doing something right,

34:02.573 --> 34:05.543
something justified.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.813
- Henry didn't know.
- Henry?

34:11.849 --> 34:14.248
Yeah, it's not her fault.
You don't know my dad.

34:14.284 --> 34:16.083
I mean, not really. He...

34:16.120 --> 34:18.460
He makes people do things
that they don't want to do,

34:18.489 --> 34:21.429
and he has had it out for
Jeremiah for years. I knew that.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.203
I mean, shit, he probably
drove her up their farm

34:23.226 --> 34:24.627
with Amos in mind,

34:24.661 --> 34:27.601
just to get under
Jeremiah's skin.

34:29.867 --> 34:31.407
Hey, truth is, I...

34:33.904 --> 34:35.444
I am no good.

34:39.208 --> 34:40.620
I wish I were,
but I don't even think

34:40.643 --> 34:42.214
I ever had a chance.

34:45.282 --> 34:49.222
My brother and... my dad...

34:50.920 --> 34:52.690
We're not good men.

34:59.396 --> 35:01.236
I'm sorry.

35:03.767 --> 35:07.507
I am so sorry.

35:07.538 --> 35:08.738
Wait, what are we doing?

35:15.412 --> 35:17.352
Lucas, Lucas,
what are you doing?

35:17.381 --> 35:18.591
Lucas, I need to get back
to my daughter.

35:18.615 --> 35:20.415
Please get out of the car.

35:26.657 --> 35:27.657
Lucas...

35:37.768 --> 35:39.408
Get out.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.830
What's he smiling about?

36:04.861 --> 36:06.401
All have strayed

36:06.430 --> 36:09.300
and come short of God's glory.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.973
There is none righteous,
not one.

36:38.428 --> 36:40.528
When I dragged him

36:40.564 --> 36:43.704
off the road... Amos...

36:43.734 --> 36:45.734
Every step I took, he just got

36:45.769 --> 36:47.639
heavier and heavier,

36:47.671 --> 36:48.848
and he wasn't that big
of a dude,

36:48.872 --> 36:50.572
so I just kept telling myself,

36:50.607 --> 36:51.684
"Just a little bit further, man.

36:51.708 --> 36:53.308
"Just a little bit further,

36:53.343 --> 36:54.787
"and then this shit
will finally be over,

36:54.811 --> 36:56.289
"and you don't have to
think about it anymore

36:56.313 --> 36:58.553
and it's all just
gonna go away."

36:58.582 --> 37:01.252
And then,

37:01.285 --> 37:02.555
I got back to the car.

37:05.756 --> 37:08.656
I found this

37:08.692 --> 37:10.562
on the floor.

37:10.594 --> 37:11.871
I mean, I should've
brought it back

37:11.895 --> 37:13.395
and I should've left it
with Amos,

37:13.430 --> 37:15.470
or just ditched it,
but I couldn't.

37:18.869 --> 37:20.969
I think it's from his mom, and...

37:23.440 --> 37:26.380
He...

37:26.410 --> 37:27.980
I read his notes in the corners,

37:28.011 --> 37:31.611
and... things he had underlined,

37:31.648 --> 37:34.288
and his questions.

37:34.318 --> 37:36.318
Like, there's nothing
really special here,

37:36.353 --> 37:41.023
but I just go over it again
and again, and it's like,

37:41.058 --> 37:43.658
you know, at least I know
what he was thinking, you know?

38:05.349 --> 38:08.589
You can't... forgive me,
can you?

38:11.888 --> 38:13.858
For what I did?

38:22.599 --> 38:24.369
You're right.

38:24.401 --> 38:25.541
You shouldn't.

38:45.622 --> 38:46.962
I know Henry needs you.

38:50.160 --> 38:53.030
I...

38:53.063 --> 38:56.803
What about you?

38:56.833 --> 38:58.803
What about me?

39:03.807 --> 39:06.407
At least let me take
the bullets from that gun.

39:06.443 --> 39:08.483
Please.

39:12.149 --> 39:14.419
You're a good mom,
you know that?

39:17.421 --> 39:19.991
My mom, she tries, but just...

39:24.628 --> 39:26.568
- Doesn't.
- Lucas...

39:30.000 --> 39:32.540
Tell Henry I'm sorry, okay?

40:16.713 --> 40:17.813
Holy shit.

40:17.848 --> 40:19.648
My God.

40:19.683 --> 40:21.223
No, Henry...

40:21.251 --> 40:23.491
Henry, no!

40:26.490 --> 40:28.690
Mom... Would Lucas?

40:28.725 --> 40:30.125
I don't know.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.600
No, Henry!

40:31.628 --> 40:34.868
You don't even know
if she's in there!

40:36.132 --> 40:37.572
Henry!

40:39.002 --> 40:41.202
Mom?

40:45.876 --> 40:47.246
Mom?

40:47.277 --> 40:48.617
Mom?

41:00.590 --> 41:01.690
Is my mom here?

41:04.227 --> 41:05.697
Henry...

41:05.729 --> 41:08.169
Clay, is my mom here?
Is she here?

41:08.198 --> 41:09.168
No.

41:09.199 --> 41:12.639
No...

41:12.669 --> 41:13.809
Please help me.

41:17.274 --> 41:19.974
Henry...

41:37.594 --> 41:38.834
Fuck.

41:43.833 --> 41:45.173
Here.

42:19.836 --> 42:21.336
Townes?

42:34.117 --> 42:35.757
Henry.

42:40.790 --> 42:42.890
Henry.

42:44.628 --> 42:46.898
Henry. What are you doing?

42:46.930 --> 42:49.200
What are you doing?

42:52.936 --> 42:54.976
Come on.
