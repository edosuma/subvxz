14:33.893 --> 14:36.123
<i>They tell me Match
is not your younger brother.</i>

14:36.295 --> 14:39.093
<i>He was Cadmus’ first attempt
to clone Superman.</i>

14:39.265 --> 14:42.063
<i>His Kryptonian DNA
rendered him uncontrollable...</i>

14:42.235 --> 14:44.533
<i>...so they froze him and tried again.</i>

14:44.704 --> 14:47.434
<i>CONNER:
Who are "they"? Desmond? Spence?</i>

14:47.607 --> 14:48.904
<i>DUBBILEX:
Desmond, yes.</i>

14:49.075 --> 14:52.977
<i>And his superior and Cadmus’ founder,
Lex Luthor.</i>

14:53.980 --> 14:55.709
[CONNER GRUNTS]

14:55.882 --> 14:57.440
So Luthor took Match.

14:57.617 --> 15:01.519
<i>DUBBILEX:
Actually, brother, I did that.</i>

15:08.528 --> 15:09.688
<i>Turn left, brother.</i>

15:36.722 --> 15:39.282
[GROWLING]

15:41.961 --> 15:45.988
Welcome, brother, to Genomorph City.

15:56.642 --> 15:59.270
CONNER: So you're responsible
for the missing genomorphs.

15:59.444 --> 16:02.641
I am. One by one, I have liberated them...

16:02.814 --> 16:06.682
...brought them here to a new life
where all our brothers can be free.

16:06.852 --> 16:11.346
Of course, I have a dream that one day
the world you live in will accept us.

16:11.523 --> 16:15.960
But for now, no one must know
Genomorph City exists.

16:16.128 --> 16:19.393
Which is why I brought our brother here.

16:24.536 --> 16:27.471
- What have you done to him?
- He is safe.

16:27.639 --> 16:30.938
The G-Gnomes keep him docile
with their psychic abilities.

16:31.109 --> 16:32.269
And the chains?

16:32.444 --> 16:34.674
Should he escape
in his current condition...

16:34.846 --> 16:38.043
...he could set back the genomorph cause
by decades.

16:38.216 --> 16:40.980
So you hold him prisoner
like Cadmus held me?

16:41.153 --> 16:42.950
You might as well put him in a pod.

16:43.121 --> 16:45.783
Our goal is rehabilitation.

16:45.957 --> 16:48.448
We will release him when he is ready.

16:48.627 --> 16:49.889
That's not your call.

16:50.829 --> 16:52.023
[GRUNTS]

16:57.202 --> 16:58.760
[GROWLING]

17:03.875 --> 17:05.342
DUBBILEX:
Be calm.

17:38.009 --> 17:39.806
You seem to have reached consensus...

17:39.978 --> 17:43.414
...that 18 years is a suitable minimum age
for joining the league...

17:43.582 --> 17:45.072
...yet what of Miss Martian?

17:45.250 --> 17:48.515
Though she is a biological adolescent
by Martian standards...

17:48.687 --> 17:51.679
...she was born 48 Earth years ago.

17:51.857 --> 17:56.260
RED TORNADO: So, what is the deciding
factor, chronology or biology?

17:56.428 --> 17:58.862
- Take Superboy.
BLACK CANARY: Exactly.

17:59.030 --> 18:00.520
He's less than a year old.

18:00.699 --> 18:04.533
Does he have to wait 17 more
to stand beside us?

18:19.418 --> 18:20.817
My turn.

19:02.994 --> 19:05.155
GUARDIAN:
Superboy, enough.

19:09.568 --> 19:12.662
He's down. You won.

19:32.390 --> 19:34.654
It has to be this way.

19:37.929 --> 19:39.920
SUPERMAN:
No other ideas?

19:41.233 --> 19:44.828
Then here are our candidates
for new or continued membership.

19:45.003 --> 19:48.131
BATMAN: We've debated origin,
gender, size, experience...

19:48.306 --> 19:50.672
...age, temperament and background.

19:50.842 --> 19:54.107
But what is the fundamental criterion
for membership?

19:54.279 --> 19:58.909
When all is said and done,
the question must be: Whom do we trust?

19:59.417 --> 20:02.750
Trust to fight beside us.
Trust to have our backs.

20:02.921 --> 20:06.584
Trust to uphold the high standards
and ideals of the Justice League.

20:07.292 --> 20:08.850
Time to vote.

20:11.563 --> 20:13.827
There was a tracker
in that tin box you gave me.

20:13.999 --> 20:17.662
Yes. I assume you discovered it
with your x-ray vision?

20:17.836 --> 20:19.736
You initiated the cloning projects.

20:19.905 --> 20:22.066
I wanted Superman to meet his Match.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.038
And you used both of us
to locate the missing genomorphs.

20:25.210 --> 20:28.475
A good businessman
has to keep track of his assets.

20:28.647 --> 20:30.672
But none of that
is what really bothers you.

20:30.849 --> 20:34.341
Half your DNA is human.
Haven't you wondered who the donor was?

20:34.519 --> 20:37.249
Or have you just been afraid
to acknowledge the obvious?

20:37.722 --> 20:41.852
Face it, son, you have much more
in common with me than Superman.

20:42.027 --> 20:44.222
- That's a lie.
- What has he given you?

20:44.396 --> 20:47.024
Nothing. Not even affection. And why?

20:47.198 --> 20:50.895
Because Big Boy Blue lives
in a world of black and white.

20:51.069 --> 20:54.766
You were created by the bad guys, so
there must be something wrong with you.

20:54.940 --> 20:57.500
But we both know
life isn't that clear-cut.

20:57.676 --> 21:00.042
The real world is full of grays.

21:00.211 --> 21:02.577
Weren't you determined to free Match
at all costs?

21:02.747 --> 21:05.409
Yet, ultimately, you wisely agreed
to my suggestion...

21:05.584 --> 21:07.711
...to refreeze him
for the greater good of all.

21:07.886 --> 21:12.016
And though you think me a villain,
you still accepted my shields.

21:12.190 --> 21:15.682
We're more alike than you care to admit.

21:16.161 --> 21:20.393
- Take them back.
- They're a gift from a father to his son.

21:20.999 --> 21:23.092
I won't need them for this.

21:23.268 --> 21:25.031
Red sun.

21:31.076 --> 21:34.978
Two words and he shut me down.
What else can he make me do?

21:48.293 --> 21:50.784
All those in favor of ratifying the results?

21:51.329 --> 21:52.921
ALL:
Aye.

21:53.098 --> 21:54.656
All opposed?

21:59.304 --> 22:01.636
Then we are adjourned.
