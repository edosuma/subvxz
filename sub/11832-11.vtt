LINDSAY: Previously on
"The Practice"...

00:02.180 --> 00:04.010
- You know, that's easy
for you to say.

00:04.010 --> 00:05.040
It's not your personal life.

00:05.040 --> 00:06.100
- Who's got a personal life?

00:06.100 --> 00:09.020
ALL: Lucy.
- Hey!

00:09.020 --> 00:10.100
Bite it right off.

00:10.100 --> 00:11.110
I quit.

00:11.110 --> 00:13.060
- We all snipe at each other.

00:13.060 --> 00:15.110
The fact that they dish it out
to you like everybody else,

00:15.110 --> 00:17.040
that's just a sign
of being accepted.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.010
- I'm not that tough.

00:19.010 --> 00:21.010
I'm just pushy.

00:21.010 --> 00:22.090
- Our dialogue with that office

00:22.090 --> 00:24.080
is more important
than any one case!

00:24.080 --> 00:26.010
LINDSAY: I've got to deal with
them on sentencing next week.

00:26.010 --> 00:27.150
I'm sure they'll be
in great moods to--

00:27.150 --> 00:29.010
- Oh, get over your professor,
Lindsay.

00:29.010 --> 00:30.080
What'd you do,
sleep with the guy?

00:32.060 --> 00:33.060
[crash]

00:35.040 --> 00:37.140
- You know, Lindsay,
about a month or so ago,

00:37.140 --> 00:38.200
we exchanged a kiss.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.050
Should we talk about it?

00:40.050 --> 00:41.150
- Not right now, no.

00:41.150 --> 00:43.010
- You're in love with him.

00:43.010 --> 00:44.120
- What?
- What are you afraid of?

00:44.120 --> 00:45.190
Because you two work together?

00:45.190 --> 00:47.120
- Let's just decorate the tree.

00:47.120 --> 00:51.030
Uh, this Christmas party,
are we supposed to bring dates?

00:51.030 --> 00:52.200
- Do you have a date?

00:52.200 --> 00:55.160
- Well, no, I mean,
I haven't asked anyone.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.150
I was just wondering.

00:57.150 --> 00:59.190
Are you bringing anyone?

00:59.190 --> 01:00.170
- No.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.090
- Merry Christmas.

01:14.020 --> 01:15.160
- Basically,
we're getting victimized

01:15.160 --> 01:18.200
by the David versus Goliath
syndrome.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.150
Poor dying man with emphysema
going up against

01:21.150 --> 01:24.090
a giant asbestos corporation.

01:24.090 --> 01:26.100
- Well, that's pretty much
how it is, isn't it?

01:26.100 --> 01:30.120
- Yes, but we've decided
to fight David with,

01:30.120 --> 01:32.020
well, David.

01:32.020 --> 01:35.100
Putting it more directly,
we want great lawyers

01:35.100 --> 01:37.220

corporate or affluent.

01:37.220 --> 01:41.050
Your firm, particularly you,
come highly recommended.

01:41.050 --> 01:42.200
- Well, that's nice to hear.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.150
- We'd be looking for you
to handle litigation

01:44.150 --> 01:47.080
in Massachusetts--
state and federal.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.120
There are three different
class actions

01:49.120 --> 01:51.030
currently pending,
all in discovery.

01:51.030 --> 01:53.030
We'd probably
want you to take over,

01:53.030 --> 01:55.100
assuming we can work
out the transition.

01:55.100 --> 01:58.130
It would probably mean
your having to hire on,

01:58.130 --> 02:00.060
but we're not opposed
to the idea

02:00.060 --> 02:02.190
of supervising other firms.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.200
- Well, I'd have to discuss this
with my partners

02:04.200 --> 02:06.020
before I could even consider it.

02:06.020 --> 02:07.150
- Of course.

02:07.150 --> 02:09.100
Why don't you do that
and get back to me?

02:09.100 --> 02:10.080
- Great.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.070

- Thank you.

02:30.090 --> 02:32.050
Is it a lot of new business?

02:32.050 --> 02:33.230
- You could say that.

02:33.230 --> 02:36.150
- Suppose you say it.

02:36.150 --> 02:39.020
- Maybe $2 million a year or so.

should we hire

Or do we want to hire
outside firms

07:41.200 --> 07:44.090

the most practical sense,

07:44.090 --> 07:46.030

07:46.030 --> 07:48.190
My recommendation is
that we start that way,

07:48.190 --> 07:51.060
and then we expand
internally so eventually

07:51.060 --> 07:53.040
we can do all the work in-house.

Why would we--

about to stop breathing.

how much money
we're talking about?

08:49.030 --> 08:51.160

This is massive
product liability.

08:53.020 --> 08:54.070

has killed people.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.130
- The only difference
between them

09:11.130 --> 09:13.030
and half our other clients

09:13.030 --> 09:14.230
is that this one
didn't intend to kill anybody,

to pay us 20 times

09:16.090 --> 09:17.170

09:17.170 --> 09:19.080

- Is that the issue?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.090
Whether or not
we can manage this?

09:22.090 --> 09:24.210
Because that is different
than the morality objection.

09:24.210 --> 09:27.050
The management issue
doesn't fall under hypocrisy.

09:27.050 --> 09:28.150
- Hey, bite me.
- All right.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.020
- Look, I think we need to have

09:30.020 --> 09:32.020
a full partnership meeting
with Eugene.

09:32.020 --> 09:33.070
There's a lot to consider here.

09:33.070 --> 09:35.050
- This is a no-brainer.

09:35.050 --> 09:36.210
What is stopping you?

09:36.210 --> 09:38.210
- Some of us have brains.
BOBBY: All right, come on.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.000
- Excuse me?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.090
BOBBY: Come on.

09:41.090 --> 09:42.170
Let's just table this for now

09:42.170 --> 09:44.190
and we'll talk more
about it later.

09:51.140 --> 09:53.080
- Bitch.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.210
[doorbell rings]

10:07.160 --> 10:10.070

10:10.070 --> 10:11.160

10:11.160 --> 10:13.070
- Can I come in a second?

10:13.070 --> 10:14.130
- Somebody dead?

10:14.130 --> 10:17.130
- I just came by to see
your new place.

10:17.130 --> 10:18.200
- Right.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.110
- Nice.

10:20.110 --> 10:22.060
The Gilbert Carr case--

10:22.060 --> 10:24.060
- Scott, I'm not sure
if you've met my roommate,

10:24.060 --> 10:26.160
Lindsay Dole, from
Donnell, Young, Dole &amp; Frutt,

10:26.160 --> 10:29.160
Eugene Young's firm,
the lawyer repping Jerry Green.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.020
- Oh, hi.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.140
- Well, if that
isn't a hint to beat it.

10:34.140 --> 10:35.190
I'll be in my room.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.150
[door clicks]

10:41.150 --> 10:43.180
- I'm a little embarrassed
to be making this call.

10:43.180 --> 10:46.050
The primaries are
a ways off, but--

10:46.050 --> 10:48.020
- But what?

10:48.020 --> 10:49.150
- It's important
that people remember

10:49.150 --> 10:52.190
Gilbert Carr's little incident.

10:52.190 --> 10:55.080
- Oh, okay,
you're here to ask me

10:55.080 --> 10:57.220
to do something disgusting
for political gain.

10:57.220 --> 11:00.040
All right, let's hear it.

11:00.040 --> 11:03.080
- You can't just establish
probable cause and sit.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.070
You got to get out
some of the graphic details.

11:05.070 --> 11:08.030
- You want me to Kenneth Starr
Jerry Green.

11:08.030 --> 11:10.200
- In which case, we drop on him.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.070
It's in his own interest.

11:12.070 --> 11:14.130
- Yes, how lucky
that he has you.

11:14.130 --> 11:16.130
- Like I said,
I don't enjoy coming here

11:16.130 --> 11:17.130
to tell you how to do--

11:17.130 --> 11:18.200
- But here you are.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.210
Um, could you excuse me?

11:20.210 --> 11:21.210
I need to shower.

11:43.150 --> 11:45.030
- You're looking at me.

11:45.030 --> 11:48.010
Am I unzipped?

11:48.010 --> 11:50.200
- Why did you ask me if I was,

11:50.200 --> 11:53.010
you know, a lesbian?

11:55.150 --> 11:56.220
- [sighs]

11:56.220 --> 11:57.220
Truth?

11:57.220 --> 11:59.100
- No, Lucy, lie.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.150
You can tell the truth
when we're close.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.030
- I was just curious.

12:02.030 --> 12:05.070
You got no guy in your life
with a rump like yours?

12:05.070 --> 12:07.100
Plus the cropped-cut
butchy-do hair--I mean,

12:07.100 --> 12:08.150
it looks good, but I--

12:08.150 --> 12:11.130
- I have butchy-do hair?

12:11.130 --> 12:13.190
- It was just a question,
Rebecca.

12:13.190 --> 12:16.070
Hey, some of my best friends
are lesbians.

12:16.070 --> 12:18.170
Today, it's almost the thing
to be.

12:18.170 --> 12:21.180
- Well, I'm not one,
thank you very much.

12:21.180 --> 12:23.020
- You don't have
to deny it on principle.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.110

12:25.110 --> 12:26.230

ELLENOR: Yes, Dole.

12:28.180 --> 12:30.050
That name's been
moving up around here.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.010
- Excuse me?
- Never mind.

12:32.010 --> 12:33.200
- No, forget "never mind."
What's that supposed to mean?

12:33.200 --> 12:34.230
- They're gonna fight again.

LINDSAY: What's your problem,
Ellenor?

12:37.150 --> 12:39.020
- My problem?
- Yes, your problem.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.220
Besides me, do you have
a legitimate problem--

12:40.220 --> 12:42.110
- All right, cut it out.

12:42.110 --> 12:44.220
God, you guys are
both acting like kids.

12:44.220 --> 12:46.100
Cut it out.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.180
- What's wrong?

12:57.190 --> 12:59.170
- In open court?
EUGENE: Yes.

12:59.170 --> 13:02.180
- It'll be public record.
- It's public record now.

13:02.180 --> 13:05.150
Jerry, if we don't agree,
you could go to trial yourself,

13:05.150 --> 13:07.220
and you could get convicted.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.080
Now, what they're offering,
you could have a clean slate

13:10.080 --> 13:11.180
by the end of the day.

13:11.180 --> 13:13.110
- And they'll conceal my name?

13:13.110 --> 13:15.200
- First and middle initial's
the best we can do.

13:15.200 --> 13:20.080
Um, you could testify in--

13:20.080 --> 13:22.030
incognito.

13:22.030 --> 13:24.220
- You mean incognito

13:24.220 --> 13:28.010
like I was arrested incognito.

13:28.010 --> 13:29.210
- Let's not kid ourselves.

13:29.210 --> 13:31.160
The likelihood is
it's gonna get out.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.230
- Oh.

13:32.230 --> 13:34.130
- But--but maybe
there's a chance.

13:34.130 --> 13:36.070
You know, I didn't recognize you
in the cell,

13:36.070 --> 13:37.130
and I've known you for 20 years.

13:37.130 --> 13:39.210
- Testify in drag.

13:39.210 --> 13:42.190
- I'm not saying
that it's the right way to go,

13:42.190 --> 13:46.010
but--I don't know.

13:49.140 --> 13:51.030
- You haven't even
asked me about--

13:51.030 --> 13:52.030
- I don't need to know.

13:52.030 --> 13:55.090
- I need you to know.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.100
- Okay.

14:02.220 --> 14:05.100
- I like wearing
the clothes,

14:05.100 --> 14:08.060
going out,
wearing the clothes,

14:08.060 --> 14:11.080
but I am not gay,
and I've never--

14:11.080 --> 14:14.070
I-I just--I just would go out
wearing the clothes.

14:14.070 --> 14:18.040
I--I've never performed
a sexual act on a man.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.150
I've never solicited anybody.

14:23.020 --> 14:25.150
I am not a male prostitute.

14:25.150 --> 14:28.200
- Then why did you go in a room
with Gilbert Carr?

14:28.200 --> 14:31.210

It's exactly what we do

of very big exceptions.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.010
First, in criminal cases, you're
not just defending a client.

You're playing a role

15:45.170 --> 15:47.110
There is a principle
at work in criminal law.

15:47.110 --> 15:49.060
I know you know that.

15:49.060 --> 15:52.040
There's no such purpose going on
in asbestos-defense work.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.030
- And the defense
itself victimizes people.

15:54.030 --> 15:55.190
It's stall tactics
against people

15:55.190 --> 15:57.040
who have suffered real injuries.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.200
- That's true
in any defense work.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.130
Every product-liability defense
is drag and stall.

16:01.130 --> 16:04.010
We are right back to hypocrisy.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.190
Are we ready to declare
right now

16:06.190 --> 16:08.110
that we will never
represent defendants

16:08.110 --> 16:11.040
in product-liability cases?

16:11.040 --> 16:13.000
- You really want
to be an asbestos lawyer?

16:13.000 --> 16:16.210
- This is one client,
a very big, paying client

16:16.210 --> 16:18.190
that maybe will help
subsidize us

16:18.190 --> 16:21.040
in defending some
of our more worthy causes.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.130
- Now you sound like
a congressman.

16:22.130 --> 16:23.220
- Lindsay--
REBECCA: All right.

16:23.220 --> 16:25.080
We've hashed this out
long enough.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.000
Why don't we vote?
ELLENOR: Hold on.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.050
I think everybody's biggest
worry is that this work

16:29.050 --> 16:30.090
will consume us,

16:30.090 --> 16:31.090
so here's the tradeoff:

16:31.090 --> 16:32.230
we take the client

16:32.230 --> 16:35.100
and I will farm out
all of the work to other firms.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.110
- But you're the one
they want to try the cases.

16:37.110 --> 16:38.210
Isn't that the point?

16:38.210 --> 16:41.000
- I can supervise
all of the discovery,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.130
and then we get to fee split.

16:42.130 --> 16:45.100
None of you will ever even
have to look at a file.

16:48.020 --> 16:50.150
All in favor?

16:50.150 --> 16:52.070
- I guess I can go with that.

16:52.070 --> 16:54.040
- All right.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.190
- Against.

16:57.190 --> 17:00.120
That's three to three.
I decide tie-breakers.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.140
We reject the client.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.210
- One of the things
about being a partner

17:08.210 --> 17:11.060
is you get to bring in clients.

17:11.060 --> 17:13.130
- Subject to a partnership vote.

17:17.140 --> 17:19.050
- Eugene,
Gilbert Carr's lawyer's here.

17:19.050 --> 17:21.160
He wants to talk.
I showed him into your office.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.200
- I was hoping, in addition
to introducing myself,

17:29.200 --> 17:32.110
we might agree to coordinate
our respective defenses.

17:32.110 --> 17:34.190
- Let me stop you.
We've been approached by the DA.

17:34.190 --> 17:36.110
This seems to be an occasion

17:36.110 --> 17:39.010
where they'd like the Jane
to flip the john, so...

17:39.010 --> 17:41.080
- That would be politics.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.030
- This I know,

17:43.030 --> 17:45.150
but since the politics
run in my client's favor, it--

17:45.150 --> 17:48.080
- I won't presume
to tell you what to do,

17:48.080 --> 17:51.060
but what happened in that room,
the police can't prove.

17:52.210 --> 17:55.050
- They were followed up,
600 bucks on the table,

17:55.050 --> 17:57.100
and your client
had his pants down.

17:57.100 --> 17:58.200
- None of which constitutes
a crime.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.090
They can't get a conviction

18:00.090 --> 18:02.090
without the cooperation
of one of the defendants.

18:02.090 --> 18:05.230
- This may be true,
but why risk it?

18:05.230 --> 18:08.070
We're being offered immunity.

18:08.070 --> 18:11.120
- Immunity from
criminal prosecution.

18:11.120 --> 18:14.120
The court of public opinion
might be less forgiving.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.020
- Meaning?

18:16.020 --> 18:17.170
- Gilbert Carr is running
for district attorney.

18:17.170 --> 18:20.040
A prosecution against him comes
with a big microscope.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.040
Anybody who falls under it--

18:21.040 --> 18:22.140
- Is that a threat?

18:22.140 --> 18:23.180
- All I'm saying is
there's no need

18:23.180 --> 18:25.130
to turn this into a spectacle.

18:25.130 --> 18:28.070
I believe, in time, I can make
the whole matter dissipate,

18:28.070 --> 18:30.060
but if your client
takes the stand this afternoon

18:30.060 --> 18:32.000
at the probable cause hearing,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I'm sure you can appreciate
that I'd have no choice

18:34.000 --> 18:36.120
but to use my best efforts
to discredit him.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.170
- What are you gonna do,

18:37.170 --> 18:39.010
get him to admit
on the stand that,

18:39.010 --> 18:40.170
instead of your
basic transvestite,

18:40.170 --> 18:42.210
he's actually
a respected stockbroker?

18:42.210 --> 18:44.080
That won't discredit him.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.010
If anything,
it makes him more believable.

18:47.010 --> 18:50.100
- I could ask him his real name.

18:50.100 --> 18:54.000
- Let me do you a favor and tell
you something about Jerry Green.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.170
He's a decent guy
and, as of right now,

Right now I'm late

- You two being a couple,
I think it's great,

20:06.120 --> 20:08.170

kind of a power base.

20:08.170 --> 20:11.030

because of my haircut
and how I dress.

20:46.090 --> 20:48.100

I can't remember the last time
a guy asked me out--

20:53.150 --> 20:55.020

Listen, can we talk
about this later?

21:10.210 --> 21:12.170

No.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.220

to reduce the chance

21:23.220 --> 21:25.160
of him being recognized.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.100
- Eugene, I'm willing
to go initials and no address

and all, but come on,
let's face it.

21:30.140 --> 21:32.140
The whole idea
from our side is publicity.

- Maybe not.

21:43.020 --> 21:44.040
- How long you known him?

21:46.010 --> 21:48.040

He's a good man.

With any luck, we might be able
to preserve his real identity.

23:30.190 --> 23:32.040
He's not on trial,

Now, I think she'll be
sympathetic to us in there,

she doesn't owe us any favors.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.050
- Excusing you.

24:50.050 --> 24:52.100
- You know, maybe we should go
into the conference room

24:52.100 --> 24:54.040

It's a piece
of across the street,

25:18.120 --> 25:20.210

that you have been chasing.

25:28.170 --> 25:30.100
Bobby, I knew his vote.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.170
He has some success phobia

25:31.170 --> 25:33.060
that none of us will
ever understand,

25:33.060 --> 25:34.200
but you?

25:34.200 --> 25:37.230
This new client is exactly
our ticket to admission

25:37.230 --> 25:40.090
to the other world
that you want!

25:40.090 --> 25:42.090
And by you voting
to turn it down tells me

25:42.090 --> 25:44.140
that you are either more
concerned with your own success

25:44.140 --> 25:46.000
than that of the firm's,

25:46.000 --> 25:47.110
or you are suddenly
under the influence

25:47.110 --> 25:48.200
of Bobby's bedcovers.

25:48.200 --> 25:51.090
Either way,
I have got a big problem!

25:52.110 --> 25:53.110
- Are you done?

25:53.110 --> 25:54.120
- For now.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.060
- First of all,
this table

25:56.060 --> 25:58.100
never represented a world where
we we represent companies that--

25:58.100 --> 26:00.030
- That isn't what--
- You said you were done.

26:00.030 --> 26:01.160
- It has nothing
to do with this client!

26:01.160 --> 26:03.080
- You said you were done.

26:03.080 --> 26:04.190
- You just don't like the idea

26:04.190 --> 26:06.190
of anyone besides you bringing
in a blue-chip--

26:06.190 --> 26:08.000
- It's about the client!

26:08.000 --> 26:09.060
- We don't have to do it
forever.

26:09.060 --> 26:11.040
- It's not who we are.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.200
It's not who you are unless
you're under some new influence.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.120
- Oh, please.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.200
- But don't be accusing me
of being subject to--

26:15.200 --> 26:17.100
- Don't tell me who I am.

26:17.100 --> 26:19.040
- Are you somebody who wants
to cross-examine widows

26:19.040 --> 26:20.190
every day saying, "Hey, maybe
your husband had the flu"?

26:20.190 --> 26:22.110
- You have never even tried one
of these cases--

26:22.110 --> 26:24.060
- Every day, your job
will be to wear them down!

26:24.060 --> 26:25.200
- You don't even know
what you're talking about!

26:25.200 --> 26:27.120
- I don't care.
You'll be the victim eventually!

26:27.120 --> 26:29.090
- And where in the partnership
agreement does it say

26:29.090 --> 26:31.020
that we have to live up to
Lindsay Dole's moral standards

26:31.020 --> 26:32.130
of what cases we take or not?

26:32.130 --> 26:34.060
- This has got nothing
to do with me or Bobby!

26:34.060 --> 26:35.210
- The day I let you judge me
will be the day

26:35.210 --> 26:37.040
that I walk out of this office!

26:37.040 --> 26:38.090
- Hey!

26:38.090 --> 26:39.170
- I tried keeping him out,
honest.

26:39.170 --> 26:41.020
- Ellenor, in my office.

26:41.020 --> 26:43.040
- Oh, go to hell!

26:45.030 --> 26:46.130

to the evening
of January 1, 1999,

26:54.190 --> 26:57.150
did you encounter anybody
sitting in this courtroom?

26:57.150 --> 26:59.070
- The defendant.

26:59.070 --> 27:01.140
- The record will reflect
the witness has indicated

27:01.140 --> 27:02.170
Mr. Gilbert Carr.

27:02.170 --> 27:04.230
Could you describe
that encounter?

27:04.230 --> 27:07.120

on Columbus Avenue

27:07.120 --> 27:09.100
about 10:30,

27:09.100 --> 27:12.120
and he pulled up in his car
and invited me to get in.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.210
- You were dressed as a woman.

27:14.210 --> 27:16.120
- Yes.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.170
HELEN: And when he invited you
in his car, you got in.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.050
- Not at first,

27:21.050 --> 27:22.230
but eventually I got in,

27:22.230 --> 27:24.170
and we drove to an apartment

27:24.170 --> 27:26.060
and went inside.

27:26.060 --> 27:28.170
- And when you got inside,
what happened then?

27:31.010 --> 27:35.210
- He removed his trousers
and his underwear.

27:35.210 --> 27:37.070
He said he just
wanted to look at me

27:37.070 --> 27:40.010
for a minute, which he did.

27:40.010 --> 27:41.180
Then...

27:43.130 --> 27:47.000
He asked me
to serve my country.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.130
- Serve your country?

27:52.130 --> 27:54.110
- He wanted me
to sing the national anthem

27:54.110 --> 27:57.070
while he sexually gratified
himself.

27:57.070 --> 27:59.080
HELEN: Did he give you money
to do this?

27:59.080 --> 28:02.020
JERRY: He put $600 on the table.

28:02.020 --> 28:03.170
- Did you do what he asked?

28:05.070 --> 28:06.170
- Yes.

28:06.170 --> 28:08.120
HELEN: And while you sang,
did he, in fact,

28:08.120 --> 28:10.110
sexually gratify himself?

28:11.230 --> 28:13.080
- Yes.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.150
- Sir, could you step out
and show us

28:15.150 --> 28:17.110
how you were
standing while you sang?

28:17.110 --> 28:18.110
CAVERN: Objection.

28:18.110 --> 28:19.230
- I apologize, Your Honor,

28:19.230 --> 28:22.100
but I'm sure Mr. Cavern
will try to convince us

28:22.100 --> 28:24.080
that his client simply
hired Mr. Green

28:24.080 --> 28:25.200
