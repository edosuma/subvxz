a hidden message app

09:52.156 --> 09:54.681
on all of the suicidal
UnSubs' phones,

09:54.724 --> 09:58.815

that the UnSub network

10:06.040 --> 10:07.389

10:07.432 --> 10:09.130
So far, I-I can only get
the public posts,

10:09.173 --> 10:12.263

is how they're coordinating.

from actively killing

10:18.052 --> 10:19.575
to finding
others to do it for him,

10:19.619 --> 10:21.229

most of that recruitment

10:21.272 --> 10:22.709
happened online.

10:22.752 --> 10:25.581
Yeah, but a serial killer
who's willing to die?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.583
A suicide pact
takes leverage.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.541

intimate details

11:35.259 --> 11:36.739

11:36.783 --> 11:40.569

we have recovered 10.

11:40.612 --> 11:41.875

from the suspect

11:41.918 --> 11:43.703

yesterday.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.487
Yes, three of the kits
were dug up

11:45.530 --> 11:48.403
before we were able
to get to them.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.492

11:52.276 --> 11:54.191

under pressure.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.063
If an UnSub wants to take
himself out of the equation,

11:56.106 --> 11:57.760
what's the big deal?

11:57.804 --> 11:59.762
Well, the big deal
is that, uh,

11:59.806 --> 12:01.633
every suspect
is a potential lead

12:01.677 --> 12:03.592
to the head
of the network.

12:03.635 --> 12:06.334
When they die,
that lead goes away.

12:06.377 --> 12:09.206

12:22.524 --> 12:25.483

12:25.527 --> 12:28.138

anti-authority groups,

of that here.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.277

12:40.411 --> 12:42.239
