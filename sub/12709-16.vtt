WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:03.071
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.104 --> 00:05.173
We're your "archnemesises."

00:05.206 --> 00:08.808
Somebody! Help! (yells)

00:08.842 --> 00:11.211
We gotta get out of this town.
Mexico.

00:11.244 --> 00:14.048
Look, I'm not saying
it's a happy scenario,

00:14.082 --> 00:16.850
but we're dealing
with a big bad that can be
any dead person it wants.

00:16.884 --> 00:19.853
You know the rules.
I can't take corporeal form.

00:21.954 --> 00:23.824
I just don't think
I can kill anybody else.

00:23.856 --> 00:25.059
(Grunts)

00:27.428 --> 00:29.730
Look who I found.
Guess who was buying...

00:29.763 --> 00:31.765
mass amounts of blood
at the butcher shop?

00:31.798 --> 00:35.002
Andrew is our--
 Actually, he's our hostage.

00:35.034 --> 00:38.439
I like to think of myself
more as a "guestage."

00:38.472 --> 00:40.573
-BUFFY:
 They're all Slayers?
-GILES: Potential Slayers.

00:40.607 --> 00:42.676
There were many more like them
 all over the world.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.512
But now there's just a handful.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.914
-Buffy?
-Uh, Principal Wood.

00:47.948 --> 00:50.183
I'd like to take you out
to dinner if that's
all right with you.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.585
-I'd be happy
to have dinner with you.
-Great.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.854
How do you know about Slayers?

00:54.887 --> 00:57.457
My mother was one.
She was killed when I was four.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.759
-A demon--
 -A vampire.

01:01.628 --> 01:05.165
(classical music playing)

01:17.245 --> 01:20.980
Oh, hello there,
gentle viewers.

01:21.013 --> 01:24.551
You caught me catching up
on an old favorite.

01:24.585 --> 01:28.188
It's... wonderful to get lost
in a story, isn't it?

01:29.456 --> 01:33.593
Adventure and heroics
and discovery--

01:33.627 --> 01:35.996
Don't they just
take you away?

01:36.028 --> 01:37.997
Hmm.

01:39.133 --> 01:42.034
(coughing)

01:45.673 --> 01:50.478
Come with me now, if you will,
gentle viewers.

01:50.510 --> 01:53.447
Join me on a new voyage
of the mind--

01:53.480 --> 01:55.783
A little tale
I like to call...

01:55.816 --> 01:59.787
Buffy: Slayer of the Vampires.

02:02.489 --> 02:07.027
ANDREW:
 It was cold last night,
 and the wind was cruel,

02:07.060 --> 02:09.562
but the Slayer
 had a job to do.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.068
(growls)

02:22.376 --> 02:26.079
Unfortunately,
 vampires have a job to do too.

02:38.057 --> 02:42.295
Ouch! My goodness!
Things look bad for the Slayer,
don't they?

02:42.329 --> 02:46.234
She didn't see
that second vampire
concealed by cover of darkness,

02:46.266 --> 02:48.536
ready--
(Knocking)

02:48.569 --> 02:52.372
(clears throat)
ready to attack and make her
his own vampirical spawn.

02:52.406 --> 02:56.043
Let's rejoin them now to see--

02:56.075 --> 02:59.847
For God's sakes, Andrew.
You've been in here for
30 minutes. What are you doing?

02:59.879 --> 03:04.050
Entertaining and educating.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.354
Well, why can't you just
masturbate like the rest of us?

03:14.395 --> 03:15.862
(theme music playing)

04:05.413 --> 04:07.948
(snarling)

04:07.980 --> 04:10.918
-Aah!
-(panting)

04:10.950 --> 04:14.086
(Murmuring)
That was great!

04:14.121 --> 04:17.824
I completely got you dusting
that guy on film. Hey, why do
vampires show up on video?

04:17.858 --> 04:21.894
I told you I didn't want you
doing that. It's distracting.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.564
Okay, I'll cut
the footage together
and do the intro tomorrow.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.968
She was a woman in danger.
Or was she?
Are you still filming me?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.403
Stop!
But it's-- it's
a valuable record,

04:30.437 --> 04:32.572
an important document
for the ages--

04:32.605 --> 04:35.007
a Slayer in action.

04:35.042 --> 04:39.480
A nerd in pain.
Would they like that?
'Cause we could do that.

04:39.512 --> 04:43.149
But the--
the story needs to be told.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.485
And birds need to fly,
and girls need
to use the toilet,

04:45.519 --> 04:48.322
and why were you
videotaping yourself anyway?

04:48.355 --> 04:51.425
It sounds like
kinky business to me.

04:51.459 --> 04:55.329
The world's gonna wanna know
about Buffy. It's a story
of ultimate triumph...

04:55.362 --> 04:58.665
tinged with the bitterness
for what's been lost
in the struggle.

04:58.699 --> 05:01.201
It's a legacy
for future generations.

05:01.233 --> 05:03.437
If there are any.

05:03.471 --> 05:06.339
Buffy seems to think that this
apocalypse is going to actually
be, you know, apocalyptic.

05:06.374 --> 05:10.143
I think your-- your story
seems pretty pointless.

05:10.177 --> 05:13.880
Oh. I was gonna interview
you later today,

05:13.913 --> 05:18.519
'cause, you know, your unique
perspective on the whole thing.
Oh.

05:18.552 --> 05:23.891
Give it editorial balance
and, uh, glamour.

05:23.923 --> 05:27.827
Oh. Well, balance
is important.
(door shuts)

05:27.860 --> 05:31.031
People don't always
take that into account.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.000
I could bring that to you.
Absolutely.

05:34.502 --> 05:38.338
Let's explore the world
of our story, shall we?

05:38.372 --> 05:42.843
This, uh-- Buffy lives
in Sunnydale, California.

05:42.875 --> 05:46.713
Um, this is
the local high school.

05:46.747 --> 05:52.019
There's a Hellmouth--
 Hellmouth-- underneath
the high school.

05:52.052 --> 05:55.021
See, weird things happen
on a Hellmouth.

05:55.055 --> 05:58.225
It attracts all sorts of,
uh, bad people...

05:58.257 --> 06:01.093
and demons and vampires.

06:01.127 --> 06:05.932
And now there's this thing in
the basement of the high school
called the--

06:05.966 --> 06:08.569
the Seal of Danzaltha--
Danzalthar,

06:08.601 --> 06:13.372
and it's sort of a door
to the Hellmouth.

06:13.406 --> 06:16.677
Uh, due to some circumstances,

06:16.709 --> 06:22.081
it got opened up a little bit...
recently.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.452
Um, and this, uh, nasty,

06:25.485 --> 06:28.922
nasty vampire thing
came out of it.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.792
It was, uh--
It was just awful.

06:31.824 --> 06:34.862
It was awful, um--

06:34.894 --> 06:38.966
Now this whole thing--
whole thing is being
orchestrated...

06:38.999 --> 06:42.069
by something called
the First.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.704
It's made up of all the evil
in the whole world.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.441
Oh, there's also,

06:47.475 --> 06:49.776
uh, these guys.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.879
Uh, they-they--

06:51.911 --> 06:55.548
they work for the First.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.985
We don't know much about them,
except for they're very ugly,

06:59.019 --> 07:01.654
and they're...

07:01.689 --> 07:04.257
very mobile for blind people.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.427
Is that all clear?

07:08.461 --> 07:13.065
It's morning in Sunnydale.
Who the hell's got
the low-fat milk?

07:13.100 --> 07:16.903
It's morning in Sunnydale,
and the women of
command central...

07:16.937 --> 07:20.507
take the time
to fortify themselves
for the day ahead.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.343
Hey!
Women and Xander.

07:23.375 --> 07:26.613
Hey, I'm gonna do
your special intro later.

07:26.646 --> 07:29.249
The man who is the heart
of the Slayer machine.

07:29.281 --> 07:31.519
Yeah? The heart?

07:32.985 --> 07:35.588
Things are tense
in command central this morning.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.290
Buffy is clearly concerned
with some unknown danger,

07:38.324 --> 07:41.961
and the air is filled
with foreboding.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.363
Oh, um,
we're out of raisin bran.

07:44.396 --> 07:48.268
I'll put it on the list.
That's probably not the...

07:48.300 --> 07:50.637
unknown danger.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.305
Look at this place.
A damn girl's dorm
is what it is.

07:53.340 --> 07:58.110
That's nice.
Secondhand stinkiness.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.348
It's a full house.
I think it's a good time
to do some introductions,

08:01.380 --> 08:05.552
don't you, gentle viewers?
I'm Amanda,
and I grew up right here.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.620
No, not you, sweetheart.
(mouths words)

08:07.654 --> 08:09.189
(girl laughs)

08:09.221 --> 08:11.257
(sighs)
Let's start from the top.

08:12.526 --> 08:16.564
(sighs)
 You've already met Buffy.

08:16.596 --> 08:21.968
She's beautiful,
 with a lion's heart and--
 and the face of an angel.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.939
She's never afraid,
 because she knows
 her side will always win.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.978
Buffy and Spike
 have some kind of history.

08:32.010 --> 08:36.048
You can feel the heat
 between them, although,
 technically, as a vampire,

08:36.082 --> 08:38.085
he's room temperature.

08:40.385 --> 08:43.389
Anya-- a feisty waif
 with a fiery temper...

08:43.423 --> 08:47.595
and a vulnerable heart
 that she hides,
 even from herself.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.605
This lovely girl--
 I don't remember her name.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.340
Oh, for God's sake,
is he doing that again?
Can't we make him stop?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.744
I don't know. If we save
the world, it will be kind
of nice to have a record of it.

09:03.777 --> 09:07.514
If we don't save the world
then... nothing matters.

09:07.547 --> 09:12.284
Hmm. That's catchy, Amanda.
Let's make that our slogan.

09:12.318 --> 09:15.554
Yeah, it is kind of strange
how you keep savin' the world
and there's not any proof.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.258
Yeah. You know,
for future generations.

09:18.291 --> 09:23.129
And it does help
the girls with training--
you know, viewing the tapes.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.232
-Come on. No one else
thinks this is idiotic?
-XANDER: Or is it important?

09:26.265 --> 09:29.068
I mean, Buff,
I don't get why this is
botherin' you so much.

09:29.101 --> 09:33.874
Because it's a waste of time.
Come on. Someone has to agree
with me. Spike?

09:33.907 --> 09:37.076
As long as you're not pointin'
that thing at me, it seems like
a fine way to keep the boy busy.

09:37.110 --> 09:40.179
This isn't about keeping busy.
This is about war.

09:41.347 --> 09:44.283
I'm sorry to jump
all over you guys,

09:44.317 --> 09:47.788
but... I have to tell you
what's really going on.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.224
There's something new.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.927
Amanda, Dawn, you're gonna
stay home from school today.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.263
We can survive what's coming,
but not like this.

09:57.865 --> 10:02.434
I had a vision
of what's to come--
a horrible vision.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.772
Hundreds upon hundreds--
(continues indistinct)
Honestly, gentle viewers,

10:04.804 --> 10:08.240
these motivating speeches
of hers tend to get
a little long.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.409
I'll take you back in there
in a-- in a little while.

10:10.442 --> 10:13.346
But in the in-between time,
I thought you might
want to know...

10:13.379 --> 10:16.950
a little about me,
your humble host.

10:16.984 --> 10:20.187
You see, I'm--
I'm a man with a burden--

10:20.220 --> 10:23.490
a man with a dark past.

10:23.523 --> 10:27.094
You see, I was once
a super villain.

10:27.126 --> 10:31.865
Thus, the validity
of the Bronsted-Debye-Huckel
equation...

10:31.899 --> 10:35.969
at low ionic strength
has been amply tested.

10:36.003 --> 10:39.807
And the charges on
the reactant ions
are well-known,

10:39.840 --> 10:42.109
if their reagents
are properly characterized.

10:42.142 --> 10:46.278
It smells funny.
I know. Kinda sweaty.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.615
What'll it do
to Buffy?
Make her super magnetic!

10:49.649 --> 10:51.884
Wow! She won't be able
to get out of her car.

10:51.918 --> 10:54.287
And knives
and other sharp things
will fly at her.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.724
We could walk right by her,
and she wouldn't be able
to stop us.

10:56.756 --> 10:59.993
Unless we were wearing
metal belt buckles.
Then we'd stick to her.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.062
In my plan,
we are beltless.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.498
Wow! You're the best,
Andrew!

11:05.532 --> 11:09.668
Yep, and good looking
and smart too.
Yeah. Wow.

11:09.702 --> 11:15.375
Warren was cool.
And wasn't Jonathan
just the cutest thing?

11:15.408 --> 11:19.046
Well, shall we see
if Buffy's still talking?

11:19.078 --> 11:21.881
...I mean mentally,
and from what
I've seen so far,

11:21.914 --> 11:24.317
there is no way
you girls are ready.
She's not done.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.086
Even Willow looks bored,
and she usually can take
a lot of that stuff.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.923
Look at her. Oh, oh.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.392
Do you see that?
That-That's important.

11:32.424 --> 11:37.397
Willow and Kennedy have been
in kind of a bad place lately,
but things are looking up.

11:37.429 --> 11:41.735
You see, Kennedy pursued
the reluctant Willow
and won her heart,

11:41.769 --> 11:44.104
only to find herself
frightened when she
glimpsed the darkness

11:44.136 --> 11:47.240
that still lies within
the witch's mind.

11:47.274 --> 11:52.913
Sidenote:
I once had my own personal
encounter with Dark Willow.

11:52.946 --> 11:56.383
DARK WILLOW:
Jonathan. Andrew.

11:56.415 --> 11:59.552
You boys like magic,
don't you?

11:59.586 --> 12:01.388
Abracadabra.

12:02.654 --> 12:04.624
(Yelps)
"Haltem!"

12:05.893 --> 12:08.561
Okay.
Didn't see that coming.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.864
That's because we have power
you can't imagine.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.465
We do?

12:12.499 --> 12:16.369
You, Dark Willow,
wield a force of mighty evil,
it is true.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.639
-But you are new
to the game, little one.
-And you know what they say:

12:19.672 --> 12:22.809
-If at first you don't succeed--
-Holy cats. Here it comes again.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.178
I deflect thy power.

12:27.947 --> 12:30.450
Damn, that is
one effective counterspell.

12:30.482 --> 12:34.586
Thank you, little one.
Thank you.

12:34.620 --> 12:38.125
She was something.
Indeed she was.

12:39.993 --> 12:43.263
Hey, I think Buffy
stopped talking.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.631
That usually means
she had to go to work.

12:45.664 --> 12:49.001
Let's see what
the little locusts
left for breakfast, shall we?

12:52.806 --> 12:55.975
(chattering)
Not late.
Not late till the bell rings.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.613
Hey! Hey! Break it up!

13:01.815 --> 13:04.150
(bell rings)
Get in class.

13:16.328 --> 13:18.197
Uh-oh.

13:19.499 --> 13:23.269
Hey, shy girl.
Don't do this.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.437
Oh.
(slaps)

13:25.471 --> 13:26.706
Ow.

13:26.739 --> 13:29.642
You knew I was there.
Yeah.

13:29.676 --> 13:32.946
Y-You noticed me.
It's okay. I promise.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.048
- It may seem that--
- (girl sobbing)

13:37.384 --> 13:42.022
Wh-Wh-What's wrong?
The mirror said I was fat.

13:42.054 --> 13:44.657
It sai it!

13:44.691 --> 13:47.894
I can't take this semester
anymore. It's just so much
for me to handle.

13:47.927 --> 13:51.398
So not only does
Mr. Hildebad move up
the trig exam to today,

13:51.431 --> 13:54.533
but he also makes it cover three
more chapters, and I've got
an English paper due tomorrow.

13:54.567 --> 13:58.638
I feel like
I'm gonna explode.
Hey, uh, I can help.

13:58.671 --> 14:02.509
You just need to relax,
you know? Maybe one of you
guys could give him a foot rub?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.711
What?

14:04.744 --> 14:07.914
Something bad is going on.
Oh, is that right?

14:07.947 --> 14:10.216
Oh, you're hurt.
What happened?

14:10.250 --> 14:13.320
Someone threw a rock at me
as I got out of my car.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.522
I didn't really get
a good chance to see who.

14:15.554 --> 14:20.493
Yeah, well, it could've been
any of 'em-- students, teachers.
Something is going on today.

14:20.527 --> 14:25.398
Yes, well, um, that
occurred to me as I ducked
the other two rocks.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.500
Buffy, what the hell
is this?
Huh. Everything.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.370
Slowly, I may be
concussed here.

14:36.976 --> 14:42.581
Mm, there's this thing that
happens here, in this school,
over the Hellmouth,

14:42.615 --> 14:46.452
where... the way
a thing feels,

14:46.485 --> 14:51.057
i-it kind of starts
being that way for real.

14:51.091 --> 14:54.760
And I've seen
all these things before,
just not all at once.

14:54.793 --> 14:59.966
So, what-- It's like hell's
a-bustin' out all over?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.934
Exactly.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.139
So, what's the worst
that can happen?

15:06.173 --> 15:08.075
War, pretty much.

15:08.107 --> 15:12.211
Oh, I see you're
being amusing now
with comical exaggeration.

15:12.245 --> 15:16.649
Being in high school
can feel like being at war.
Now it's true.

15:16.682 --> 15:18.951
The students feel
like the teachers
are out to get them,

15:18.985 --> 15:21.788
the Chess Club
resents the French Club
for taking the activities room,

15:21.821 --> 15:24.390
and, well, everybody hates
the cheerleaders.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.559
If we don't do something
about this, we're gonna have
a riot on our hands,

15:27.594 --> 15:30.429
and a lot of other
nasty stuff too.
Like what?

15:30.462 --> 15:33.399
(boy screaming)
(explosion)

15:33.432 --> 15:36.802
(scattered shouts, screams)
He really should've
had that foot rub.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.913
Dawn is a typical American
teenager, bubbly and sweet
with a hunger for fun...

15:47.947 --> 15:50.082
and a smile that
lights up the room.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.620
(giggles) Hello.

15:53.653 --> 15:58.158
Dawn used to be a key.
I don't really know
what that means.

15:58.191 --> 16:01.760
(Andrew gasps)
Oh, hey.

16:01.793 --> 16:04.364
Heh! Here's something
I think you're going to be
interested in, gentle viewers.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.336
Look at the fine work Xander did
on replacing that window sash.

16:09.369 --> 16:12.839
You can't even tell it's new,
it blends in so well.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.907
He's extraordinary.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.379
WOOD:
And you've dealt
with this before?

16:19.412 --> 16:22.682
I mean, you've seen stuff
like this in the high school?

16:22.715 --> 16:27.820
Sure. You know,
swim team monsters
or killer prom dogs--

16:27.854 --> 16:29.322
again, not all at once.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.559
So what makes now
so special?

16:33.592 --> 16:37.697
My guess?
It's that Seal thing
in the basement.

16:37.730 --> 16:41.201
It's like all the Hellmouth's
energy is trying to escape
from that one little spot,

16:41.234 --> 16:43.235
and it's getting all--
Focusy.

16:45.837 --> 16:49.808
Careful. You're starting
to speak like me now.

16:49.841 --> 16:55.682
This is Xander and Anya
interview number one for Buffy:
 A Slayer of the Vampires.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.684
ANYA:
That's what you're calling it?
Either that or,

16:58.717 --> 17:02.554
Buffy: The Slayer
 Who Knew No Fear.
I like that one.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.192
Thank you, Xander.
That's sweet of you.

17:05.223 --> 17:09.662
I understand that exactly
one year ago today,
you left Anya at the altar.

17:09.694 --> 17:13.732
Any comment on that?
Whoa. What the hell?

17:13.766 --> 17:16.502
I just think people
will be interested.

17:16.536 --> 17:20.207
I know I am. What do you
have to say for yourself
one year later?

17:20.240 --> 17:23.343
I've apologized enough.
That's what I have to say.

17:23.375 --> 17:28.214
-But you think it was something
that called for an apology?
-Well, yes.

17:28.248 --> 17:31.417
So, you don't think it was
the right thing to do.

17:31.451 --> 17:35.855
-Of course he doesn't think
it was the right thing to do.
-It was the right thing to do.

17:35.887 --> 17:38.125
-What?
-Interesting.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.227
I feel like we're
getting to something here.

17:40.259 --> 17:43.630
Look, Anya, if had married you,
it would've been against
everything I felt was best.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.298
It wouldn't have worked.

17:45.332 --> 17:46.665
But we--

17:48.401 --> 17:51.104
we still spark.

17:51.137 --> 17:55.074
I mean, I--
I get jealous of you.
You get jealous of me.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.911
You still love me.

18:00.579 --> 18:04.284
Is that true, Xander?
Do you still love her?

18:09.122 --> 18:11.290
BUFFY:
I swear we just
covered this thing up.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.259
WOOD:
It doesn't want
to stay hidden anymore.

18:13.292 --> 18:18.765
It wants to turn these kids
into monsters and victims
and who knows what.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.000
Well, it's more
than that.

18:21.032 --> 18:23.569
Look, Robin, I, um--

18:23.603 --> 18:26.472
I had a vision
the other day.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.176
You have visions?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.444
Sometimes.
Oh.

18:32.479 --> 18:38.184
Well, how do you know
that they're not just dreams?

18:38.218 --> 18:41.453
You're running
to catch the bus naked?
That's a dream.

18:41.488 --> 18:45.825
Army of vicious
vampire creatures?
That's a vision.

18:45.857 --> 18:47.960
Also, I was awake.
A bus to where?

18:49.296 --> 18:52.964
-I mean, an army of how many?
-Hundreds.

18:52.999 --> 18:56.469
Maybe hundreds of hundreds.
I--

18:56.502 --> 18:59.806
All I know is
the last ubervamp I faced
crawled out of that very hole.

18:59.838 --> 19:03.509
Makes me awfully nervous.
What are you doing?

19:03.542 --> 19:06.979
Now, have you ever
really studied it?
You know, gotten close?

19:07.012 --> 19:09.682
Well, I know it's a goat
with its tongue out.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.852
Uh, Willow did a search
on the symbolic database,

19:12.884 --> 19:16.323
but, uh, it turns out everybody
likes a good goat's tongue--

19:16.355 --> 19:19.392
rock groups, covens
and Greek cookbooks.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.894
-She said she couldn't
narrow it down.
-And you trust her?

19:21.928 --> 19:24.663
Yes.
Why wouldn't I trust her?

19:24.696 --> 19:27.200
I don't know why any of you
should trust each other.

19:27.233 --> 19:30.670
-You've all been evil
at some point, right?
-No, that's-that's not true.

19:30.702 --> 19:36.643
I mean, yeah,
Willow had a bad patch,
but I've never been.

19:36.675 --> 19:40.346
(voice deepens)
Evil is what evil does,
and I know what you're doing.

19:43.516 --> 19:48.954
You're with that vampire,
screwing that vampire,
you filthy whore!

19:50.623 --> 19:53.559
Robin, are you okay?

19:53.593 --> 19:55.595
Ohh!

19:55.627 --> 19:57.763
What happened?

19:57.797 --> 20:02.034
I-- I think it was
controlling you.

20:02.067 --> 20:04.336
Buffy, we gotta
get rid of this Seal.

20:04.371 --> 20:07.038
We gotta shut it down before
it starts affecting everyone.

20:07.073 --> 20:10.777
Think I have
a pretty good idea
who we should talk to.

20:10.809 --> 20:14.046
Yeah? Who's that?

20:14.079 --> 20:16.949
The guy that fed it
its first drop of blood.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.917
(squealing)

20:21.953 --> 20:24.457
God, I hope that's
not a student.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.896
I thought I told you to piss off
with this bloody camera.

20:30.930 --> 20:34.300
Yet, here you are again
with that thing in my face.
Would you sod off...

20:34.334 --> 20:37.202
before I rip your throat out
and eat your--
ANDREW: Uh, Spike?

20:37.236 --> 20:40.038
The light was
kind of behind you.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.107
Oh, right.

20:42.141 --> 20:44.611
Uh... (sighs)

20:44.644 --> 20:46.945
what, this better then?

20:46.979 --> 20:49.281
(exhales sharply)

20:49.316 --> 20:51.651
I thought I told you to piss off
with that bloody camera.

20:51.683 --> 20:54.421
Here you are again
with that thing in my face.
Would you sod off--

20:54.453 --> 20:57.523
You keep dodging
the question.
I don't mean to.

20:58.958 --> 21:02.328
It's just, you know
how I feel, right?

21:02.362 --> 21:05.597
And you were the one who--
who didn't want to keep
seeing each other.

21:05.632 --> 21:09.736
And here's where we hop on
the merry-go-round
of rotating knives.

21:09.769 --> 21:14.340
I blame you and you blame me,
and we both end up
all cut to shreds.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.308
Please, just tell--

21:17.477 --> 21:19.612
Do you still love me?

21:19.645 --> 21:21.814
Yes.

21:21.847 --> 21:25.151
I still love you.
I always will.

21:25.183 --> 21:29.556
I just don't know if that
means anything for us anymore.
Well, I love you too.

21:31.289 --> 21:33.859
I don't know if that
means anything either.

21:35.461 --> 21:38.431
Well, it's nice to hear.

21:38.464 --> 21:42.501
I'm not gonna find anyone
out there like you, am I?

21:44.170 --> 21:46.238
It doesn't seem likely.

21:47.839 --> 21:50.509
I guess I'm more replaceable,
obviously.

21:50.542 --> 21:53.380
No.

21:53.413 --> 21:56.015
(continues on camcorder)
There's no one like you, Xander.
(mouthing words)

21:56.048 --> 21:59.385
You were willing to stand up
to danger, even when your hands
had no weapons.

21:59.419 --> 22:02.054
You were-were ready
to protect me with your life.

22:04.022 --> 22:06.692
Yeah, I guess we
fit together pretty good.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.796
ANYA:
We fit together great.

22:09.828 --> 22:13.566
XANDER:
You know, sometimes I want
to be back in your life.

22:13.599 --> 22:16.368
ANYA:
I hope you know
you never left my heart.

22:20.906 --> 22:23.675
(audio reversed, sped up)
(clicks)

22:23.710 --> 22:27.346
I'm not gonna find anyone
out there like you, am I?

22:27.380 --> 22:30.849
-It doesn't seem likely.
-(door opens)

22:30.883 --> 22:33.152
Heads up, Andrew.
We gotta talk.
(door shuts)

22:33.184 --> 22:34.921
We just spent the day
keeping a lid on a war.

22:34.953 --> 22:37.557
Ooh! That will be
very exciting on tape.

22:37.589 --> 22:39.759
The school is out of control
with energy from the Hellmouth.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.760
It's time for you
to help, Andrew.
Well, right now,

22:41.794 --> 22:46.164
Well, right now I'm really
more about the recording of--
No. No more watching.

22:46.198 --> 22:51.237
The Seal thing is your baby, and
you gotta get in there before
it tears everything apart.

22:51.269 --> 22:53.605
(door opens, thuds)

23:10.423 --> 23:12.659
(all chanting in Latin)

23:29.442 --> 23:32.278
(deep voice)
 Desde abajo te devora.

23:32.310 --> 23:35.181
Desde abajo te devora.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.355
Desde abajo...

23:47.292 --> 23:50.061
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

23:50.096 --> 23:53.164
-Jesús.
-Did you have it again?

23:53.199 --> 23:56.903
-I had it again.
-And that voice--

23:56.935 --> 24:00.239
(attempts to recite chant)

24:00.271 --> 24:03.142
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

24:03.174 --> 24:07.179
Let's try looking it up
again in the morning
in the diccionario.

24:07.212 --> 24:10.817
-Holy cats,
that was terrifying.
-We're fugitives,

24:10.849 --> 24:16.355
haunted by our past,
tormented by a message
we don't understand.

24:16.387 --> 24:20.326
We're hunted men,
driven mad by forces
beyond our understanding.

24:20.358 --> 24:26.097
We're men of faded power,
tortured from within by--
by a voice out of nowhere.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.669
I don't deserve this.
I wasn't even that evil.

24:29.701 --> 24:33.673
-I thought you were evil.
-Yeah?

24:33.705 --> 24:35.674
Sure.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.211
I respected your ideas for--
for evil projects,

24:40.246 --> 24:42.448
and I thought you had
good follow-through.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.284
Oh. Well, thanks.

24:45.317 --> 24:49.055
It's nice that you noticed.
WILLOW: Okay, I think we're
getting a little off track here.

24:49.087 --> 24:52.223
I don't want to do this anymore.
Everyone's staring at me.

24:52.258 --> 24:56.729
Just focus on the charm.
You have to focus on the charm
to pull the memories out.

24:56.762 --> 24:59.632
-Tell us about the Seal.
-But it tickles,
and I'm all tense.

24:59.665 --> 25:02.000
Can't I have a cool,
refreshing Zima?

25:02.034 --> 25:05.070
BUFFY: No Zima.
SPIKE: Shut your face
about the Zima. Just talk.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.673
You were the first one
to uncover the Seal
and feed it blood.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.710
-How did you know it was there?
How'd you know what to do?
-I-I don't know.

25:10.742 --> 25:13.045
Stuff happened.
I-- I forget.

25:13.078 --> 25:15.847
So remember.
Look at the charm.

25:15.882 --> 25:18.917
But I'm not a part of this.
I document.

25:18.951 --> 25:22.755
I don't participate.
I'm the detached journalist
recording with a neutral eye.

25:22.788 --> 25:27.226
Andrew! Stop it,
or I'm going to smash
this camera over your head.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.528
Actually,
I'm gonna do that anyway,
so you might as well talk.

25:29.561 --> 25:32.598
And stop going off topic.
I wasn't off topic!

25:32.632 --> 25:37.169
It's gonna get relevant
in a second, because Jonathan's
gonna go to the bathroom.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.438
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

25:44.375 --> 25:46.945
* La cucaracha

25:48.079 --> 25:50.449
* La cucaracha

25:51.584 --> 25:54.086
* La la la la la

25:54.119 --> 25:56.255
(gasps)
Did you get the knife?

25:56.288 --> 25:59.057
Oh! Oh, gosh.

25:59.090 --> 26:03.561
Gosh, I'm... glad to see you.
Me too.
You're looking good.

26:03.596 --> 26:06.699
Am I? I... probably have
pillow creases.

26:06.732 --> 26:10.769
No, no, it's good. You're a man
on the run. You got kind of
a wild, desperate thing goin'.

26:12.739 --> 26:16.474
Did you, uh--
Did you get the knife?

26:16.508 --> 26:18.877
Yeah. It wasn't easy.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.814
I had to meet this demon guy
who sells all kinds of
weird weapons and stuff.

26:21.847 --> 26:24.450
-Okay, show me.
-Well, I didn't buy them,

26:24.482 --> 26:29.421
but there were poison arrows
and this sort of
collapsible sword.

26:29.454 --> 26:32.391
-Show me the knife!
-Oh, right. (chuckles)

26:32.423 --> 26:36.929
-Quick, before
the shortcake comes back.
-Oh, it'll be a while.

26:36.962 --> 26:40.298
He's got a shy bladder.
Jonathan, you okay in there?

26:40.332 --> 26:41.667
JONATHAN:
Don't talk to me. I'm fine.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.605
Pretty knife, except the,
uh-- the stabbing.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.910
I don't--
I don't think I can do it.

26:50.942 --> 26:54.012
Jonathan has been
a good friend to me
here in México.

26:54.046 --> 26:57.148
He said he'll
buy me a burro.
No, you can stab him.

26:57.182 --> 26:59.585
That was all part
of the plan.

26:59.617 --> 27:02.354
That boy's blood is
a powerful tribute.
It's a--

27:02.387 --> 27:05.958
It's a gift
to something very big,
very important,

27:05.991 --> 27:08.193
and ultimately,
it won't even hurt him.

27:08.227 --> 27:12.097
We get a reward--
you and me and him too.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.834
We live as gods.
That's right, man.

27:14.866 --> 27:18.971
The Trio,
livin' as gods.
(Snaps Fingers)

27:19.005 --> 27:21.272
* We are as gods, oh
(unicorn whinnies)

27:21.307 --> 27:23.442
* We are gods

27:23.474 --> 27:25.510
* We are as gods,
we are as *

27:25.544 --> 27:28.980
(falsetto)
* Gods *

27:29.015 --> 27:32.451
There's power in that knife.
Drive the words deep into him.

27:32.483 --> 27:35.688
It's the only way for us
to get our reward.
Got it.

27:35.721 --> 27:39.791
If I kill him
with this knife,
we live as gods.

27:39.826 --> 27:42.795
Wait a second. Go back.
What was that part again?

27:42.828 --> 27:46.965
-You mean this part?
-* We are as gods

27:46.999 --> 27:49.902
Not that part.
We need to see that knife.

27:49.935 --> 27:53.471
-There's something there.
-Kennedy, search his stuff.
Find the knife.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.909
It's not in my stuff.
It's in the kitchen
in the cutlery drawer.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.679
You didn't have
any steak knives.

28:00.712 --> 28:03.849
You put your old murder weapon
in with our utensils?

28:03.883 --> 28:07.486
-I washed it.
-SPIKE: What are
you lookin' for?

28:07.519 --> 28:12.892
He said the First said
something about words, like,
"Drive the words deep into him."

28:12.924 --> 28:15.862
There was some carving on
the blade. I just thought
it was a pattern.

28:17.395 --> 28:19.298
Found it.

28:23.301 --> 28:27.673
Okay, you're Mr. Demon Summoner.
How are you with
demon languages?

28:27.705 --> 28:30.541
Well, you were right.
It's in Tuwarik.

28:30.576 --> 28:35.614
It's, uh, like, proto-Tuwarik.
It's really, really old.

28:35.646 --> 28:39.417
But what's the big?
We've never known anything
about this Seal.

28:39.451 --> 28:43.454
Now we know that this knife
and this language are connected
to it somehow.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.092
Andrew, do you
speak Tuwarik?

28:46.125 --> 28:49.929
Yeah, I'm okay with it.
It says,

28:49.961 --> 28:55.902
"The blood which I spill
I consecrate to
the oldest evil."

28:55.934 --> 28:58.269
-KENNEDY: Creepy.
-Wil, what are you thinking?

28:58.304 --> 29:01.440
You think you can
do something with that?
I--

29:01.472 --> 29:03.910
Let me work on it.

29:03.942 --> 29:06.144
I think it's got a shot.

29:07.814 --> 29:10.883
Guess what, Andy? You just won
yourself a free vacation

29:10.916 --> 29:13.152
to the beautiful
downtown Hellmouth.

29:13.184 --> 29:15.621
So he can do what?
Yell at it in it's own language?

29:15.653 --> 29:19.657
-Maybe.
-What? I-- I'm not following.

29:19.691 --> 29:22.661
Look, we have to deal
with the Seal right away.
We already might have to

29:22.693 --> 29:25.832
just shut the school down,
and I am not losing any more
territory to the First.

29:25.865 --> 29:28.299
Besides,
it's the only thing
we've got.

29:28.334 --> 29:32.304
The Seal responds to this
language somehow, or the First
wouldn't have needed the knife.

29:32.337 --> 29:37.308
Andrew knows the language--
can really talk to it,
maybe give it commands.

29:37.343 --> 29:40.278
Come on.
Robin, Spike, let's go.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.794
Riot that
almost happened.

29:55.827 --> 29:58.529
-Looks to me like
it happened after all.
-(distant shout)

29:59.698 --> 30:01.700
Looks to me like
it's still happening.

30:05.237 --> 30:09.441
Nice way to run a school.
There's gotta be kids
injured in here.

30:09.474 --> 30:12.010
Yeah. Easy pickings for
the likes of you, huh?

30:12.044 --> 30:14.881
Hey, here to help,
you know?

30:14.913 --> 30:17.016
Right.

30:17.048 --> 30:19.317
Check out Spike
and the principal.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.619
There's something
going on there--

30:21.653 --> 30:24.190
sexual tension you could
cut with a knife.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.696
(distant shouts)

30:32.898 --> 30:34.833
BOY:
This way! Come on!

30:36.335 --> 30:39.872
These kids went nuts,
didn't they?
No kidding.

30:39.905 --> 30:42.074
Shh. They'll hear you.

30:42.107 --> 30:44.009
Buffy, they're all
the way down-- Uuh!

30:47.413 --> 30:49.681
Spike!

30:49.714 --> 30:52.518
-SPIKE:
Kids are getting stronger.
-ANDREW: Oh, God. Oh, God.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.752
Struck down before
I achieve redemption.

31:25.917 --> 31:29.020
Spike! Don't kill 'em!
They're just students.

31:29.055 --> 31:31.423
They'll live.

31:39.097 --> 31:42.534
Okay. Spike, Wood,
I need you guys to stay here.
Hold our line of retreat.

31:42.567 --> 31:46.238
So, I'll be staying here with
these men, helping out with
that holding-the-line thing.

31:46.271 --> 31:48.173
I'll be with Buffy.

31:51.509 --> 31:56.214
We make our way down the stairs,
carefully, alert for any danger.
Oh, stop it!

31:56.248 --> 31:58.984
I was just--
No more.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.953
But I just-- I just want
the world to see what you do.

32:01.988 --> 32:05.723
What I do is too important
to show the world.
Ooh, I like that.

32:05.757 --> 32:09.961
Be quiet!
I don't want a biographer,
especially a murderer.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.931
Yeah, well, see, about that?
We just keep tossing
that word around,

32:12.964 --> 32:15.334
but that's not really
what happened.

32:15.366 --> 32:18.470
What? You stabbed
Jonathan to death.

32:18.503 --> 32:23.442
What were you trying to do?
Scratch his back from the front?
It was confusing.

32:23.474 --> 32:26.845
Jonathan and I were digging,
but Warren was there,
and only I could see him.

32:26.877 --> 32:29.115
ANDREW'S VOICE:
 Not one of them
 cares about you.

32:29.147 --> 32:32.817
JONATHAN:
But I care about them.
That's why I'm here.

32:32.851 --> 32:35.487
-Do it. Stab him.
-No. I can't do it.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.923
What?
Do it now.

32:37.955 --> 32:40.192
-This isn't right.
-Stab him. Spill the blood.

32:40.226 --> 32:42.693
Who are you talkin' to?
What isn't right?
What's wrong with you?

32:42.728 --> 32:45.096
FIRST/WARREN:
Are you a little coward?
No.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.699
-But did you actually think
I could use this?
-That's good.

32:47.732 --> 32:49.867
-JONATHAN: A knife?
-Just do it. It'll feel good.

32:49.901 --> 32:52.471
-What's going on?
-He's making me do it.

32:52.503 --> 32:56.142
You tricked me. Damn you!
I'll kill you first!

32:56.174 --> 32:58.710
Stab him!
You have to!
I'll kill you!

32:58.743 --> 33:01.180
If you fail, I'll haunt your
soul and I'll hate you forever!
I'll kill you!

33:01.212 --> 33:03.315
-(gasps)
-(thuds)

33:08.220 --> 33:10.788
No-o-o!

33:10.821 --> 33:13.125
(crying)

33:13.159 --> 33:15.560
See, I'm a man trapped
by circumstances into
paying for a crime...

33:15.594 --> 33:17.195
I didn't even--
Huh.

33:17.229 --> 33:20.298
What?
No, I just--
I thought you would say that.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.501
I saw the Seal possess Wood
like that earlier today.

33:23.535 --> 33:26.172
Yes. Yes, see--

33:26.204 --> 33:28.574
JONATHAN:
That's why I'm here.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.548
Die! Die!

33:37.615 --> 33:39.117
Die!

33:41.686 --> 33:43.755
What...

33:43.788 --> 33:45.624
(knife clatters)
have I done?

33:46.724 --> 33:49.728
Get out of my brain!

33:49.760 --> 33:52.698
(screams, sobs)

33:55.767 --> 33:58.537
You just completely changed
your entire story.
Did not.

33:58.569 --> 34:02.441
Uh, you did too.
Did-- Hey, here we are.

34:02.473 --> 34:06.112
(students chanting In Latin)
Wait.
There's someone in there.

34:06.144 --> 34:09.614
We should go.
Whoa. No.
We are going in.

34:09.648 --> 34:13.619
Just be prepared, okay?
The Seal could've done
anything to them.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.585
Go.

34:20.425 --> 34:23.329
Nope. They're okay.

34:31.802 --> 34:33.204
XANDER:
Well.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.273
Well, well.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.809
That was nice.

34:37.842 --> 34:41.947
It certainly was,
you carpenter you.
Heh-heh!

34:41.980 --> 34:45.483
It's too bad
Buffy took Spike's
chains down, huh?

34:45.516 --> 34:47.485
(sighs)
You said it.

34:50.121 --> 34:53.324
Mmm. I feel good.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.661
Uh, well, yeah.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.164
I'm a spitfire
in the bedroom.

34:59.197 --> 35:02.601
Yeah, I knew we'd always
do that again.

35:02.634 --> 35:06.271
Yeah, one more time anyway.

35:06.304 --> 35:08.773
Is that what that was?

35:08.806 --> 35:11.242
One more time?

35:11.277 --> 35:15.581
Do you think there--
there should be more?

35:15.614 --> 35:17.849
I don't know.

35:17.882 --> 35:20.385
It was nice. It felt, uh--

35:22.653 --> 35:25.291
It felt like
a "one more time."

35:25.324 --> 35:29.494
I think maybe
we're really over.

35:29.527 --> 35:33.097
Which, uh--
It's good, right?

35:33.130 --> 35:36.702
I mean,
now we can move on.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.405
Sure.

35:46.177 --> 35:50.382
I wonder what's keepin' 'em.
I thought they'd be
up here by now.

35:50.416 --> 35:52.717
How'd they make this in here,
you suppose?

35:55.085 --> 35:59.190
Woodshop, I guess.
It's nice to know they're
paying attention in class.

36:34.393 --> 36:40.898
She's like a woman fighting
for more than life. She fights
like fighting is her life.

36:40.931 --> 36:45.135
It is the air she breathes,
and she knows she will win
because there is no alternative.

36:55.813 --> 36:59.284
(panting)
It's your turn, Andrew.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.594
So you figure, what? I, uh--

37:08.626 --> 37:14.333
I stand on the Seal and hold
the knife and, like, command it
to stop glowing in Tuwarik?

37:16.134 --> 37:18.804
-Or we could do this.
-What?

37:18.836 --> 37:21.273
It doesn't really make sense,
does it?

37:21.306 --> 37:24.710
Bringing you here
to talk to it?

37:24.742 --> 37:28.579
This thing doesn't
understand words.
It understands blood.

37:28.614 --> 37:33.117
Blood opens it.
You don't want to open it.
Opening it... would be bad.

37:33.150 --> 37:36.422
Yeah, Willow did
a little research.

37:36.454 --> 37:39.391
Turns out the blood of
the person that awoke it-- you--

37:39.425 --> 37:41.559
Different kind of deal.

37:41.592 --> 37:44.094
It reverses the whole thing.

37:44.128 --> 37:46.931
So, how-- how much blood...

37:48.434 --> 37:50.668
are you gonna--

37:50.702 --> 37:54.373
I don't know.
Maybe not enough to kill you.

37:57.141 --> 38:01.447
So, this is my
redemption at last.
I buy back my bruised soul...

38:02.481 --> 38:04.815
with the blood of my heart,

38:04.849 --> 38:07.318
but-- but not enough to--
to kill.

38:07.353 --> 38:09.454
Stop.

38:09.487 --> 38:11.690
Stop telling stories.

38:11.722 --> 38:13.858
Life isn't a story.

38:13.891 --> 38:15.994
Sorry. Sorry.

38:16.027 --> 38:19.530
Shut up.
You always do this.

38:19.565 --> 38:24.101
You make everything
into a story, so no one's
responsible for anything,

38:24.135 --> 38:26.371
because they're just
following a script.

38:26.405 --> 38:30.208
Please, don't kill me.
Warren said Jonathan
would be okay.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.811
I trusted him,
and I lost my friend.

38:32.844 --> 38:36.547
You didn't lose him.
You murdered him.

38:36.581 --> 38:39.784
(whispers)
I know.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.152
You don't need to kill me.

38:42.186 --> 38:44.590
You said we could
all get through this.
I made it up.

38:45.322 --> 38:48.159
I'm making it all up.

38:48.193 --> 38:51.630
So what kind of hero
does that make me?

38:51.663 --> 38:56.001
No, you're--
you're doing great,
really. Kudos.

38:56.034 --> 39:00.005
Yeah? Well, I don't
like having to give
a bunch of speeches...

39:00.038 --> 39:02.440
about how we're
all gonna live,
because we won't.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.677
This isn't some story
where good triumphs

39:06.711 --> 39:08.880
because good triumphs.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.048
Good people
are going to die.

39:11.081 --> 39:13.719
Girls.

39:13.751 --> 39:15.887
Maybe me.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.989
Probably you.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.391
Probably right now.

39:20.425 --> 39:23.260
Don't. Please.

39:23.293 --> 39:25.597
Don't, please!

39:25.630 --> 39:30.235
When your blood pours out,
it might save the world.

39:30.268 --> 39:32.903
What do you think about that?
Does it buy it all back?

39:32.938 --> 39:35.407
-Are you redeemed?
-No.

39:35.440 --> 39:39.077
-Why not?
-Because I killed him.

39:39.110 --> 39:42.280
(crying)
Because I--

39:42.313 --> 39:47.351
I-- I listened to Warren,
and I pretended I thought
it was him,

39:47.385 --> 39:50.621
but I knew--
I knew it wasn't.

39:52.791 --> 39:57.228
And I killed Jonathan,
and now...

39:57.262 --> 40:00.231
you're gonna kill me,
and I'm--

40:00.264 --> 40:03.768
I'm scared
and I'm going to die.

40:05.402 --> 40:07.338
And this--

40:08.606 --> 40:11.275
this is--
this is what Jonathan felt.

40:14.144 --> 40:16.246
(sobbing)

40:26.190 --> 40:27.992
It stopped.

40:32.864 --> 40:34.766
Thanks.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.836
Sorry I had to--
You--

40:38.869 --> 40:41.639
So you weren't really
gonna stab me, were you?

40:41.672 --> 40:43.809
I wasn't going
to stab you.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.280
What if the--
the tears didn't work?

40:55.019 --> 40:57.322
(sniffling)

41:06.731 --> 41:08.733
What's goin' on?

41:12.036 --> 41:16.106
