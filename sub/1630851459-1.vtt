08:04.885 --> 08:06.518
Thought you said over $60.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.219
Why would I say that?
I don't know.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.988
You're the one who's always
going on about

08:10.057 --> 08:12.123
"best shelter" this,
"better than todd" that.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.959
It just seems a bit extravagant
for a cat whose vision

08:14.094 --> 08:15.427
Is 50% at best.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.262
I was just trying
to make you proud.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.831
Plus, I had to pay extra for
the drill, the laser level,

08:19.900 --> 08:21.866
The japanese chisels
for the drawbridge.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.234
We don't need a drawbridge.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.603
I agree. Should I give these
receipts to you or to joy?

08:25.639 --> 08:28.540
Me. Unless they fall
into the shredder first.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.741
Shredder's broken.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.276
Of course it is.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.812
♪ you got it, yeah, you got it ♪

08:33.947 --> 08:36.180
♪ walking down the street,
you know... ♪

08:36.250 --> 08:37.949
I can't guarantee
a lot of hours,

08:37.951 --> 08:40.351
But there will be some.
It's mostly helping kristian.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.887
Oh, 'cause I was hoping to do
more of the business stuff.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.556
More of an ideas guy.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.358
Yeah, we just need someone
who can walk the dogs.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.392
For example, you should
fix the flusher in the can

08:48.428 --> 08:49.761
And your coffee tastes
like melted plastic.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.128
Well, it used to
taste like garlic,

08:51.164 --> 08:52.564
So that's an improvement.

08:52.566 --> 08:53.731
Hey, don't stress.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.900
I just know people work
better with good coffee,

08:55.936 --> 08:56.901
So I brought in this.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.303
Oh, wow.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.472
Yeah. Makes caps, fraps,
lattes, ice cream floats

09:00.474 --> 09:02.974
If you rig the nozzle,
but I could take it home if--

09:03.109 --> 09:05.110
No, no. That's very sweet.
I'm sorry if I've been...

09:05.112 --> 09:06.711
It's just been
a bear of a week.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.747
I know, but I'm here now.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.582
Double pumpkin misto?
I'll bring it to your office.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.384
Thank you.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.290
No, umma, I haven't
gone to shoppers yet.

09:18.425 --> 09:21.459
I know halabeoji
needs his fiber powder.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.528
Yes, I know he likes orange.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.130
I like orange.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.731
Hey, joy wonder.
Ah, gotta go.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.600
Great job on the website,
but we're charging

09:28.669 --> 09:31.269
$60 for adoptions
and $30 for surrenders.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.470
Okay.

09:32.506 --> 09:34.271
I want pics of every
animal we can unload.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.407
And have you done missy's
instagram comments yet?

09:36.443 --> 09:38.543
Um, yeah. Here's one.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.478
Um, happy birthday to me.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.414
#birthday. #me. X-o missy.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.615
Okay.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.017
It's just the first draft.

09:46.152 --> 09:48.353
Good, 'cause I need
you to dig deep on this.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.088
Yes, we want
the comments to be fun,

09:50.223 --> 09:52.424
But they also need
to be true to our girl.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.225
What is missy's
internal struggle?

09:54.361 --> 09:55.627
Why do we care?

09:55.629 --> 09:58.296
What darkness is under
that warm, fuzzy exterior,

09:58.431 --> 09:59.764
But keep her likeable.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.032
Right.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.934
Just off the top of my head,
maybe something like,

10:03.003 --> 10:05.436
"meows and kisses,
come party with the misses.

10:05.505 --> 10:08.306
#ageing #catvibes."

10:08.308 --> 10:09.808
Oh my god.
That's actually really good.

10:09.943 --> 10:10.975
Why aren't you typing?

10:11.044 --> 10:12.276
Uh, yeah.
Putting it in now.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.379
Wunderbar! Send it to me in 30?
Mm-hm.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.186
What's your problem?

10:22.222 --> 10:24.322
I spilled coffee
on the new laptop

10:24.457 --> 10:26.124
And now shannon wants
a social media blitz

10:26.259 --> 10:28.325
And max is so rich
he has his own horse.

10:28.362 --> 10:30.995
I'm hearing that you
need a new laptop. Correct?

10:30.998 --> 10:32.163
Mm-hm.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.632
Well, it's your lucky day.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.300
I also need metamucil
from the drug store.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.003
Ooh, been there.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.103
(groaning)

10:43.610 --> 10:46.244
♪ it's too damn cold outside
for me to go out there ♪

10:48.548 --> 10:51.149
Liam:
If you can give me one loan,
you can give me ten.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.452
That's the saying!
Hey, there! Ross.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.554
Did you forget
my first name?

10:56.590 --> 10:59.591
Shannon!
I'm usually very good at this.

10:59.593 --> 11:01.492
So, shannon,
love the cat party idea,

11:01.528 --> 11:03.828
But then paul showed me
the condo and I was like, whoa!

11:03.963 --> 11:05.629
I know, he went
a bit over budget, but--

11:05.666 --> 11:07.364
No. It gave me an idea.

11:07.401 --> 11:08.900
A tale of two condos,
so to speak.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.369
Missy's condo and my condos.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.037
Aren't we trying
to home animals?

11:13.106 --> 11:14.739
Picture this.
People come to the party,

11:14.775 --> 11:16.040
They see missy's condo.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.910
They think, "I want to
live in a condo, too!

11:18.979 --> 11:21.713
Then they see a fabulous booth
with brochures, business cards,

11:21.848 --> 11:24.582
Scented candles, and a lovable
developer setting them up to

11:24.584 --> 11:27.852
View a one-of-a-kind
luxury condo.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.553
Ooh! What kind of
candles are we talking?

11:29.589 --> 11:31.456
No! See? Already distracting
from the animals.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.224
Just think about it.
If you have time between

11:33.293 --> 11:34.793
Hiring family
and making cappuccinos

11:34.928 --> 11:36.194
Out of your
new espresso machine.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.261
Okay, the machine is nikki's,

11:37.297 --> 11:39.464
But... You can set up
your booth.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.966
Great. My partner hugh's on it.
Say hi to ross, babe!

11:42.102 --> 11:43.067
Hello.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.469
And who's your
social strategist?

11:44.604 --> 11:47.338
I was hoping for somebody with
a blue checkmark on twitter.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.140
Joy, I need you to
add this handle

11:49.176 --> 11:51.008
To a couple
of our party posts.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.012
It's, ah,
@liamturnercondos.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.747
Ah, ah, yeah. Uh, one sec.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.949
Why are my aunt and uncle
your background?

11:58.985 --> 12:02.020
Nikki was using it,
um, 'cause I let her.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.088
She wasn't doing anything wrong.
Neither was I.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.056
What was that handle again?

12:09.596 --> 12:12.897
Nikki, just wondering why
joy's computer is engraved

12:12.933 --> 12:14.966
With your dad's name,
number, and home address?

12:14.968 --> 12:16.968
Hm. Might be time for
a background check on joy.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.436
Pictures of aunt peggy
and uncle russ

12:18.505 --> 12:19.838
Are the screen saver.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.707
Fine. My dad gave me his old
computer and I sold it, okay?

12:22.709 --> 12:24.909
'cause why do I need a computer?
To send emails like:

12:25.044 --> 12:28.045
10:41 am.
Elbow deep in poop bags. Again.

12:28.047 --> 12:29.347
Excuse me. Hi.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.281
Hi.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.315
I'm jeffrey. Max's dad.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.583
Just here to pick him up.

12:32.652 --> 12:35.119
I'm shannon. Max's boss.
Well, everybody's boss.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.454
I'm the director.
Uh, nice to meet you.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.089
How do we know
you're not a murderer?

12:39.126 --> 12:40.058
Nikki!

12:40.193 --> 12:41.726
Ah, would you
like to see some id?

12:41.728 --> 12:42.927
Pretty sure even
murderers have id.

12:42.963 --> 12:43.862
No. That's fine.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.397
Max is in the back, jeffrey.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.699
Okay. Thank you.

12:48.735 --> 12:49.900
You, too.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.806
Glad to see you believe
a potential psycho

12:54.941 --> 12:56.073
More than your own cousin.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.075
Okay, you're the one who
told him where max was.

12:58.077 --> 13:00.278
We needed a sacrifice.

13:00.347 --> 13:03.581

Come on, turbo. Let's go.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.229
I'm sure you and bella
will be very happy.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.565
She's a surprise
for my girlfriend.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.999
And just a warm,
non-judgmental reminder.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.501
Returns are $30.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.306
Great job on getting
the word out there.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.507
14 adoptions and counting!

13:29.576 --> 13:31.376
Glad to hear it.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.378
And, again, I am so sorry
about the laptop.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.914
Oh, stuff happens.
Don't worry about it.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.982
Next time,
just tell me, okay?

13:38.117 --> 13:39.984
It's just when I told you
about the bathroom mirror,

13:40.119 --> 13:41.986
You said I shouldn't.
Right.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.988
Also the spider in
the bathroom is still there.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.122
It had babies.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.224
Maybe space 'em out,
one thing a day.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.096
Hey! Nikki insisted I bring her
pleather top for the party.

13:52.098 --> 13:56.333
Oh, um, she's just finishing
up some work, hopefully.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.736
You know nikki's really turned
a corner since starting here.

13:58.738 --> 13:59.870
She looks up to you.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.873
I don't get that impression.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.440
Yeah, especially seeing
her handle the burglary.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.010
She was so assertive
and organized, just like you!

14:06.145 --> 14:07.278
Burglary?

14:07.413 --> 14:08.412
Nikki didn't tell you?

14:08.448 --> 14:09.814
First, they took
my espresso machine.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.883
A real beaut.
I won it at bridge club.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.150
Oh, no.

14:13.152 --> 14:14.686
And then they came
back for russ's laptop,

14:14.688 --> 14:17.021
Then his curling jacket.
Little bastards.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.757
Anyway, nikki called
the insurance company

14:19.759 --> 14:21.626
And now
it's all being replaced.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.427
Hey, isn't that your janitor?

14:23.496 --> 14:25.964
Hey, donna!
Does he curl?

14:26.099 --> 14:27.231
Hey.
Excuse me!

14:27.267 --> 14:28.633
My husband belongs to that club

14:28.635 --> 14:30.434
And he just had
his jacket stolen.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.637
Okay, thanks.
Hang onto yours!

14:32.772 --> 14:34.505
I said I'd meet you
in the parking lot.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.006
I needed to use the bathroom.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.242
Nikki, would you like to tell
your mom why paul is wearing

14:38.278 --> 14:41.379
A jacket that looks
exactly like uncle russ's, hm?

14:41.514 --> 14:44.883
No! I thought you were
over your klepto phase.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.985
Paul needed a curling jacket.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.321
Oh, uh, it does look
quite dashing on him.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.390
Nikki, enough!
If you want to keep this job,

14:52.459 --> 14:53.992
You give everyone
their money back

14:53.994 --> 14:55.459
And you call
the insurance company

14:55.495 --> 14:57.161
And you tell them
you found the stuff.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.796
If not, there is the door.

14:58.798 --> 15:01.666
And don't even think about
wearing that top to this party.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.100
Relax, it's vegan.

15:03.136 --> 15:06.170
Ross, how am I supposed to
sell condos without a visual?

15:06.239 --> 15:08.139
We need the cat
and the condo out here now.

15:08.274 --> 15:09.674
Kristian's just
getting her ready.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.608
Sorry, gotta go check
on the birthday girl.

15:13.212 --> 15:14.679
(sighing)

15:14.681 --> 15:16.814
I thought you'd want
the cafe magnifica

15:16.816 --> 15:18.582
From switzerland.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.951
Yes, hello,
I'd like to cancel a claim.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.820
Yeah, I can hold.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.656
Is it really
from switzerland?

15:24.791 --> 15:26.557
I saw it in the photo
of oprah's kitchen.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.759
Oh, hang up. Hang up!

15:28.795 --> 15:30.294
(gasping)

15:30.297 --> 15:31.429
Oh, wow.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.364
Yeah. It's really sad.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.500
Now, I'm kind of
rethinking the drawbridge.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.969
No, I meant missy. She's dead.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.637
Oh, my god! Missy.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.106
Her journey had just begun.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.042
Had it, though?

15:44.177 --> 15:46.511
Maybe she thought it
was too late for her.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.912
Another night alone,

15:47.914 --> 15:50.648
Overlooking a city
of strangers thinking,

15:50.717 --> 15:52.450
"what am I doing here?"

15:52.519 --> 15:54.652
And then she leapt.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.987
She just
had a heart attack.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.589
Oh. Well, that's more peaceful.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.825
Then plummeted to the ground,
snapping her hip.

16:00.827 --> 16:03.628
Liam (singing):
Happy birthday to missy!

16:03.630 --> 16:07.265
Happy birthday to-- oh, dear.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.866
She's gone.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.735
That's unfortunate.

16:10.804 --> 16:11.869
Not just for me.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.805
We all loved missy.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.475
I'm guessing it's
too late to swap cats?

16:17.610 --> 16:18.542
Liam.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.011
Mm?
A lady has died.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.546
She's not some thing that can
be replaced with a new model.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.216
Agreed, but we do need to
tell the guests something.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.517
Can missy be a dog?

16:26.652 --> 16:27.651
No!

16:27.721 --> 16:30.621
Sorry! We're all in shock.

16:30.690 --> 16:31.823
Take your time.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.761
Shannon, I know it's not
quite the same thing,

16:36.830 --> 16:39.830
But I once bowed out of
a speech at a friend's wedding

16:39.866 --> 16:42.299
Saying that I had
irritable bowel syndrome,

16:42.335 --> 16:43.835
And most people
don't question it.

16:48.574 --> 16:53.310
(guests chattering)

16:53.380 --> 16:55.046
Hi, there.

16:55.048 --> 16:58.315
Hi. Hello.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.283
(clearing throat)
hi.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.085
(tapping cup)

17:01.087 --> 17:02.252
Hey, there.

17:02.288 --> 17:03.855
Hello.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.522
(tapping cup)

17:05.558 --> 17:08.126
Hey! Shut the hell up!

17:08.261 --> 17:09.260
Go ahead.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.861
Thanks, paul.

17:10.897 --> 17:14.132
And thanks to you all
so much for coming.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.466
It means a lot to me

17:15.601 --> 17:19.203
And I, uh, know it meant
a lot to missy minks,

17:19.205 --> 17:20.838
But, as it turns out,

17:20.907 --> 17:24.675
Missy minks has gone
to a better place.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.411
A seven-story condo
built by yours truly!

17:27.414 --> 17:30.948
No. No. Yeah. No.
(clearing throat)

17:31.084 --> 17:34.085
Missy minks has passed away.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.320
God, I built it too high.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.690
She was brave in
the face of le change.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.760
When the world said,
"stay down," she flew.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.097
Some would say fell,
but she sacrificed herself

17:46.099 --> 17:48.032
So that other animals
could be adopted,

17:48.101 --> 17:52.970
Because it never is
too late to find your place,

17:52.972 --> 17:55.840
Even your last place,
in this world.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.542
Thanks, shannon.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.910
Nicely said, and it's true.

17:59.979 --> 18:03.647
We can never assume something
we treasure, a pet, a loved one,

18:03.683 --> 18:05.983
A luxury condo,
will always be there.

18:06.119 --> 18:08.852
In fact, I believe there
are only a few units left,

18:08.888 --> 18:11.255
And the prices
are very competitive.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.060
But missy will be missed.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.795
That's the takeaway.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.997
There's also
a cat condo for sale.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.266
$900 or best offer.

18:23.603 --> 18:30.741
♪

18:30.810 --> 18:32.543
Nikki and I are
just heading home,

18:32.545 --> 18:34.745
But thanks for the party.
So fun...

18:34.814 --> 18:38.849
And sad, but it's good having
you here in hamilton.

18:38.852 --> 18:40.952
Yeah,
and since my mother's here...

18:41.087 --> 18:42.953
She is?
She didn't call me.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.354
Uh, no.
Different mother.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.289
Birth mother.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.091
Oh.
So, you're looking into that.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.893
Yeah. I'm just curious...

18:48.895 --> 18:50.828
Mm-hm.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.095
What?

18:52.132 --> 18:55.299
Well, I think your birth mom
moved to manitoba.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.767
Judy from our church?

18:56.803 --> 18:58.169
She works at the agency...

18:58.304 --> 18:59.436
Oh.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.038
Have you heard anything else?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.306
Oh, she was a hair dresser.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.508
There was a rumour she
slept with the drummer from

19:04.511 --> 19:06.844
Mike and the mechanics.
You kind of look like him.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.512
Hm. Hopefully her, too.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.447
We're just lucky you happened.

19:10.449 --> 19:14.652
You've made my sister so happy
and we love you so much.

19:14.787 --> 19:15.987
Mm.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.022
Okay, let's go.
My next party's at seven.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.523
We'll have you for
dinner real soon.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.125
I'll be in the car.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.062
Yes?

19:25.064 --> 19:26.597
Honesty box?

19:26.599 --> 19:28.666
This party was off the chain.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.401
It had death, stealing.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.736
Okay, well,
you did the stealing.

19:31.871 --> 19:32.803
Point is, it was fun.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.238
Thanks.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.007
I'll see you tomorrow.
10:00 o'clock.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.307
I wake up at noon.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.610
It's not a negotiation.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.218
Liam:
I'm just saying why rent when
you can own?

19:47.287 --> 19:48.686
Oh, wow.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.223
The natural light is
amazing during the day,

19:52.358 --> 19:54.091
And the sun just sparkles
off that steel mill.

19:54.127 --> 19:55.158
Uh-huh.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.693
There's a bedroom
above the kitchen,

19:56.729 --> 19:59.897
A communal rooftop garden
and a yoga studio downstairs.

19:59.966 --> 20:03.434
I don't know. It's a bit
industrial and storage-y.

20:03.503 --> 20:07.371
But cozy,
and a toilet for every room.

20:07.506 --> 20:08.372
Oh.

20:08.507 --> 20:09.840
I'll even cover your condo fees.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.308
Why would you do that?

20:11.344 --> 20:13.176
I just want someone I can
trust who will love this place

20:13.213 --> 20:14.444
As much as I do.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.180
And occasionally let
service people in to access

20:16.315 --> 20:18.081
The building's
air filtration system.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.383
(buzzing)

20:19.518 --> 20:22.453
And surge transformer.
It used to be the utility room.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.322
You get used to the buzzing
and the whooshing.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.257
Please don't tell me sewage
comes out of the shower.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.625
Not yet.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.060
So, can I assume there's
free storage and parking?

20:30.129 --> 20:31.928
Seriously?
And wi-fi.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.631
Oh, my god.
'kay, done.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.767
Welcome home...
Shannon ross.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.271
I can't believe I'm doing this.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.741
Well, that was a verbal
confirmation, so congrats.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.011
Oh, and, uh,
great job at the party today.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.212
I know the shelter
and my condo plans took a hit,

20:49.249 --> 20:52.149
But together we are going to put
east hamilton on the map.

20:52.151 --> 20:55.619
Literally. It's often marked
industrial sector f.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.455
Thanks. I'm excited!

20:57.457 --> 20:58.756
A place to call my own.

20:58.758 --> 20:59.824
Oh, and that reminds me.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.158
The building's phone
and cable relay box

21:01.227 --> 21:02.593
Is in your linen closet.

21:02.662 --> 21:05.229
I have a guy coming
to check it tomorrow. Bye.

21:06.565 --> 21:07.597
Bye.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.039
Hey, hamilton.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.707
(door opening)
leaving the keys.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.309
I was just--

21:18.378 --> 21:19.577
