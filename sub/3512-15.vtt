WEBVTT

00:08.498 --> 00:10.800
Coffee shop's on
the south side of 67th and Lex.

00:10.834 --> 00:13.402
Take the 65th street transverse
across the park.

00:13.436 --> 00:15.738
Freaking tourists on 5th Avenue
always screw up traffic.

00:21.010 --> 00:22.978
It's Madison. Probably running late.

00:23.012 --> 00:25.447
<i>- Hey, bitch.
- Hey, Madison.</i>

00:25.482 --> 00:27.916
<i>Sure this comes as a shock</i>
<i>to you, but I'm running late.</i>

00:27.950 --> 00:29.251
Of course you are.

00:29.286 --> 00:32.521
<i>I'll meet you there as soon as...</i>

00:34.557 --> 00:36.725
<i>Just my stupid Lacrosse trophy.</i>

00:36.759 --> 00:39.394
<i>Anyways, I'm on my way in five.</i>

00:41.430 --> 00:42.664
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

00:42.699 --> 00:43.665
Uh, hear what?

00:43.700 --> 00:45.500
<i>Hold on. Stay with me.</i>

00:45.534 --> 00:48.503
<i>Who's there?</i>

00:48.537 --> 00:49.637
<i>Hello?</i>

00:53.542 --> 00:55.876
<i>Oh, my God. I think it's...</i>

00:55.911 --> 00:57.044
Madison?!

00:57.079 --> 00:58.112
<i>Aah!</i>

01:09.725 --> 01:12.193
Uh, shall I put on a little music?

01:12.227 --> 01:15.029
Are you trying
to get me in the mood, Castle?

01:15.063 --> 01:16.630
Yes, I am... in the mood to select

01:16.664 --> 01:18.298
one of these amazing wedding bands.

01:18.333 --> 01:19.633
Oh.

01:19.667 --> 01:22.402
I've weeded out the hacks
and selected five finalists.

01:22.437 --> 01:24.003
A band?

01:24.038 --> 01:25.572
What's a party without a deejay?

01:25.607 --> 01:27.006
That's rhetorical, right?

01:27.041 --> 01:28.375
Come on, Castle, I don't want

01:28.409 --> 01:30.477
some cheesy band leader
trying to imitate Sinatra

01:30.511 --> 01:33.046
when we're dancing
our first dance to "Witchcraft."

01:33.080 --> 01:34.681
I want Ol' Blue Eyes himself.

01:34.716 --> 01:36.850
Uh, well, sadly, he's not available.

01:36.884 --> 01:39.853
No, but his recordings are via a deejay.

01:39.887 --> 01:42.321
Can we go back a second? Why would
we be dancing to "Witchcraft"?

01:42.356 --> 01:44.323
- 'Cause it's our song.
- Since when?

01:44.358 --> 01:47.227
Since we sang it at the karaoke
bar in the Hamptons last summer.

01:47.261 --> 01:48.461
I thought our song

01:48.495 --> 01:50.730
was Bruce Springsteen's
"Dancing in the Dark."

01:50.765 --> 01:51.898
Since when?

01:51.932 --> 01:53.867
Since I had the boss pull you onstage

01:53.901 --> 01:55.534
Courtney-Cox style at the beacon.

01:55.569 --> 01:57.737
Do we not have a song?

01:57.771 --> 01:59.438
We must have a song.

02:01.308 --> 02:03.942
It looks like they're playing it now.

02:03.977 --> 02:05.010
Beckett.

02:05.044 --> 02:07.580
Murder at Sutton Place.

02:14.187 --> 02:16.655
Fancy address for a homicide.

02:16.689 --> 02:18.323
Fancy family.

02:18.357 --> 02:21.960
Our victim, Madison Beaumont...
she was a senior at, uh...

02:21.995 --> 02:24.897
Faircroft Preparatory Academy.
I recognize the crest.

02:24.931 --> 02:26.765
One of the many schools I attended

02:26.800 --> 02:28.000
on my road to greatness.

02:28.034 --> 02:30.435
Okay, so, there's signs of struggle.

02:30.469 --> 02:33.070
Looks like Madison put up a fight.

02:33.105 --> 02:34.238
Was she here alone?

02:34.273 --> 02:36.408
Yeah. Parents were gone for the evening.

02:36.442 --> 02:37.542
Mother's a designer.

02:37.576 --> 02:39.477
Father's some
high-powered defense attorney.

02:39.512 --> 02:40.812
- Forced entry?
- Nope.

02:40.846 --> 02:42.347
Nothing's missing, either,

02:42.381 --> 02:44.549
so probably
wasn't a burglary gone wrong.

02:44.583 --> 02:47.751
Is that blood up there on the rafter?

02:47.786 --> 02:49.320
Yes, and it's hers.

02:49.354 --> 02:50.321
How'd it get up there?

02:50.355 --> 02:53.157
Well, as far as we can tell,

02:53.192 --> 02:55.293
our killer threw Madison up there.

02:55.327 --> 02:57.428
Which is probably what killed her.

02:57.462 --> 02:59.163
She has a major intracranial injury.

02:59.198 --> 03:01.565
She was thrown against the ceiling?

03:01.599 --> 03:03.934
That is a superhuman feat

03:03.968 --> 03:05.769
bordering on physically impossible.

03:05.804 --> 03:07.103
Okay, Castle, let's hear it.

03:07.138 --> 03:09.039
What's your outlandish theory?

03:09.073 --> 03:10.341
Isn't it obvious?

03:10.375 --> 03:12.275
Madison made the Hulk angry.

03:12.310 --> 03:14.445
Well, Hulk or no Hulk,

03:14.479 --> 03:16.213
liver temp puts the time of death

03:16.247 --> 03:18.349
somewhere between 8:00
and 10:00 tonight.

03:18.383 --> 03:20.717
Which fits with our 911 call.

03:20.751 --> 03:23.419
Call came in at 9:08 from a cabbie

03:23.454 --> 03:25.688
saying that someone was
being attacked at this address.

03:25.723 --> 03:27.190
A cabbie? Did he witness the murder?

03:27.225 --> 03:28.691
We're still not clear on that.

03:28.726 --> 03:30.227
We're trying to track him down.

03:30.261 --> 03:32.295
Meanwhile, Espo's talking
with Madison's family

03:32.330 --> 03:33.596
back at the precinct.

03:35.866 --> 03:38.668
If only we'd stayed home
instead of going to dinner.

03:38.702 --> 03:41.838
We wanted to give Madison her space.

03:41.872 --> 03:44.540
- We've been fighting a lot.
- About what?

03:44.575 --> 03:48.544
Her not studying,
her not talking to us...

03:48.579 --> 03:50.946
normal teenage stuff.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.647
I have to ask.

03:53.816 --> 03:56.318
Do you know of anybody who might
want to hurt your daughter?

03:56.353 --> 03:58.020
No. No, of course not.

03:58.054 --> 04:00.722
Madison had so many friends.

04:00.757 --> 04:02.258
Her favorite thing to do

04:02.292 --> 04:04.726
was plan events for everyone to enjoy.

04:04.761 --> 04:06.929
The winter ball is in two...

04:06.963 --> 04:09.297
Two days.

04:09.331 --> 04:11.933
Well, we think whoever did this

04:11.967 --> 04:15.336
had to be unusually strong...
muscular, maybe.

04:15.371 --> 04:16.938
Do you know of anybody in her life...

04:16.971 --> 04:18.540
Oh, my God.

04:18.574 --> 04:21.041
Charles, what about Riley?

04:21.076 --> 04:22.411
Uh, who's Riley?

04:22.445 --> 04:25.579
Riley Mitchum... her ex-boyfriend.

04:25.614 --> 04:27.715
Madison broke up with him last month.

04:27.749 --> 04:29.683
He didn't take it well.

04:29.718 --> 04:30.985
Riley Mitchum...

04:31.020 --> 04:32.820
according to the Faircroft
football website,

04:32.854 --> 04:35.689
"he's 6'2" and 210 pounds."

04:35.724 --> 04:37.258
There's your Hulk, Castle.

04:37.293 --> 04:38.993
Well, though murder is at odds

04:39.028 --> 04:41.429
with the values instilled
in a Faircroft man.

04:41.463 --> 04:44.164
I haven't been back here
since I was a senior.

04:44.198 --> 04:46.434
So, this is where you graduated, huh?

04:46.468 --> 04:48.569
Well, I would have,
if it wasn't for the fact

04:48.603 --> 04:50.638
that one night,
my buddies and I sneaked in

04:50.672 --> 04:53.641
and pushed a cow up 12 flights
of stairs onto the roof.

04:53.675 --> 04:55.609
- A cow? Really?
- Yep.

04:55.644 --> 04:56.777
So, what happened?

04:56.812 --> 04:58.245
Did you guys get expelled?

04:58.279 --> 05:00.647
No, just me. I wasn't connected
like my buddies were.

05:00.681 --> 05:02.983
I was the scholarship kid,
so I got the boot.

05:03.017 --> 05:05.052
Well, I think you turned out all right.

05:05.086 --> 05:06.753
Me, too.

05:06.787 --> 05:08.288
Man, this is awful.

05:08.323 --> 05:10.257
I mean, Madison was,
like, my first love.

05:10.291 --> 05:11.959
Must've hurt when she broke up with you.

05:11.993 --> 05:13.994
Wait, y... you guys got it all wrong.

05:14.028 --> 05:15.695
I broke up with her.

05:15.729 --> 05:17.464
Mm, not according to her mom.

05:17.498 --> 05:19.599
Man, her... her parents
didn't have a clue, okay?

05:19.633 --> 05:20.934
A couple months ago,

05:20.968 --> 05:22.969
Madison started going out
all times of the night.

05:23.003 --> 05:25.638
- She wouldn't tell me what she was up to.
- Was she seeing someone else?

05:25.673 --> 05:28.575
I figured she had to be,
but I never found out who.

05:28.609 --> 05:31.243
Where were you last night?

05:31.278 --> 05:35.481
Was with... my new girl.
You can ask her.

05:35.515 --> 05:38.317
Okay, well, I'm gonna need
a name to confirm that.

05:38.352 --> 05:41.220
Excuse me.

05:41.254 --> 05:43.389
- Hey, Beckett.
- Hey, Ryan.

05:43.423 --> 05:44.523
I need you to check into

05:44.557 --> 05:46.658
Madison's phone records
and recent activity.

05:46.693 --> 05:48.393
Look for anyone new in her life.

05:48.427 --> 05:51.229
You got it. Meantime,
we located that cabbie.

05:51.263 --> 05:54.099
He says two female passengers
saw the attack on a video call.

05:54.133 --> 05:56.134
They told him to call 911.

05:56.168 --> 05:57.669
Then they bolted from the cab.

05:57.704 --> 05:59.605
But he gave us the building
where he picked the girls up,

05:59.639 --> 06:00.839
and the doorman there I.D.'d them.

06:00.874 --> 06:03.441
- Where are they now?
- Same place you are.

06:05.544 --> 06:08.313
Kris Howard? Hillary Cooper?

06:08.347 --> 06:10.982
It's about Madison, isn't it?

06:12.318 --> 06:15.220
We were Facetiming with her
when it happened.

06:15.254 --> 06:16.654
It was horrifying.

06:16.688 --> 06:18.423
Well, then, why didn't you call 911?

06:18.457 --> 06:20.691
We just panicked.

06:20.726 --> 06:21.926
We were scared.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.360
Of what?

06:23.395 --> 06:25.195
That we'd be next.

06:25.230 --> 06:28.198
Next? What, did the attacker see you?

06:28.233 --> 06:31.669
No, but...

06:31.703 --> 06:32.703
What?

06:32.738 --> 06:36.774
Look, uh, two weeks ago,

06:36.808 --> 06:39.243
this thing happened in the cafeteria...

06:39.277 --> 06:41.878
Hey. The principal said we're
not supposed to talk about it.

06:41.913 --> 06:43.847
About what?

06:45.616 --> 06:47.418
You'll have to ask him.

06:50.355 --> 06:52.256
The principal will be with you
in just a moment.

06:52.290 --> 06:54.257
Thank you.

06:54.291 --> 06:56.626
Castle, none of this adds up.

06:56.661 --> 06:58.161
What were those girls so afraid of?

06:58.195 --> 07:00.229
What happened in that cafeteria?

07:00.264 --> 07:02.032
I'd offer a theory, but I'm too busy

07:02.066 --> 07:03.332
having detention flashbacks.

07:03.367 --> 07:05.802
You must've spent a lot of time
in this hallway.

07:05.836 --> 07:07.170
More than I did in class.

07:07.204 --> 07:08.972
I bet that principal hated you.

07:09.006 --> 07:10.886
I'm wondering if "hate"
is a strong-enough word.

07:10.907 --> 07:13.176
Principal Dunnan had to hire a crane

07:13.210 --> 07:14.710
to get that cow off the roof.

07:14.744 --> 07:17.980
But I'm sure that old battle-ax
has long since retired.

07:18.014 --> 07:20.749
Put out to pasture, so to speak.

07:20.784 --> 07:24.087
Is that a bovine reference, Mr. Rodgers?

07:24.121 --> 07:28.057
Principal Dunnan,
you're, uh... still here.

07:28.091 --> 07:30.392
And, sadly, you have returned.

07:37.801 --> 07:40.603
I see you have managed
to extricate yourself

07:40.637 --> 07:43.205
from a life of delinquency, Mr. Rodgers,

07:43.239 --> 07:45.707
and become a writer... of sorts.

07:45.741 --> 07:49.578
Well, actually,
it's, uh, Mr. Castle now.

07:49.612 --> 07:51.346
You'll always be Rodgers to me.

07:51.380 --> 07:53.715
Uh, we need to ask you a few questions

07:53.749 --> 07:55.383
about Madison Beaumont.

07:55.418 --> 07:56.651
It's a terrible business.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.920
It's a real tragedy
for the entire Faircroft family.

07:58.954 --> 08:01.522
Two of her friends,
Kris Howard and Hillary Cooper,

08:01.556 --> 08:03.290
witnessed the murder over Facetime,

08:03.325 --> 08:05.927
but they're not willing to talk.
We need to know why.

08:05.961 --> 08:08.562
Apparently, it's related to something

08:08.597 --> 08:10.397
that happened in the cafeteria recently?

08:13.936 --> 08:15.369
Mr. Dunnan?

08:15.403 --> 08:17.204
I'll tell you,

08:17.239 --> 08:20.441
but you have to agree
not to make any of this public.

08:20.475 --> 08:22.409
It will damage the school's reputation.

08:22.444 --> 08:24.878
We are in the middle
of a murder investigation.

08:24.912 --> 08:28.048
You're not exactly
in the position to bargain here.

08:28.082 --> 08:31.118
Very well.

08:32.486 --> 08:34.486
I'm surprised he can use a computer.

08:34.522 --> 08:38.958
I am old, not deaf, Mr. Rodgers,
and undaunted by technology.

08:38.993 --> 08:40.226
Two weeks ago,

08:40.260 --> 08:43.897
a student captured this event
on his cellphone.

08:43.931 --> 08:45.431
- "Event"?
- Yes.

08:45.466 --> 08:49.169
I removed the video from his phone.

08:49.203 --> 08:50.970
I didn't want anyone to see it

08:51.004 --> 08:53.173
until the incident was fully understood.

08:55.008 --> 08:57.577
<i>- Alli Billings? - Hot.
- So hot. - So hot.</i>

08:57.611 --> 09:00.246
<i>- All right, all right. Rikki Gelson?
- No way!</i>

09:00.281 --> 09:01.981
<i>I'd still hit it!</i>

09:02.015 --> 09:03.616
High-school guys playing "hot-or-not"...

09:03.651 --> 09:05.318
- that's the event?
- Just wait.

09:05.352 --> 09:07.987
<i>Okay, Jordan Gibbs... hot or not?</i>

09:08.021 --> 09:09.555
<i>What?</i>

09:10.991 --> 09:12.591
Jordan is a good student,

09:12.625 --> 09:14.160
but she's a bit of a black sheep.

09:14.194 --> 09:16.662
<i>What's for lunch, Jordan... linoleum?</i>

09:16.697 --> 09:20.332
And she's being bullied by
our victim and her friends.

09:20.366 --> 09:22.834
Keep watching.

09:31.110 --> 09:32.611
<i>Aah!</i>

09:32.645 --> 09:33.978
<i>Aah!</i>

09:38.718 --> 09:41.953
That... is the event.

09:41.987 --> 09:44.455
The outcast...

09:44.489 --> 09:45.724
The mean girls,

09:45.758 --> 09:49.194
the rage that erupts
in a telekinetic attack.

09:49.228 --> 09:51.162
This is a real-life "Carrie."

10:10.949 --> 10:12.884
This has got to be a hoax.

10:12.924 --> 10:15.493
I ran into the cafeteria as soon
as the commotion started.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.894
The place was in shambles,
but if it was a hoax,

10:17.929 --> 10:19.497
the perpetrator left no evidence.

10:19.531 --> 10:22.099
Okay, well, we'll need
a copy of this for analysis.

10:22.133 --> 10:25.035
- Now, has anything like this happened
before? - No.

10:25.069 --> 10:27.037
Um, yes...

10:27.071 --> 10:28.238
at the crime scene.

10:28.272 --> 10:30.406
This explains Madison's head wound,

10:30.441 --> 10:32.175
the blood on the rafters.

10:32.209 --> 10:34.811
Jordan threw her up there
using the powers of her mind...

10:34.846 --> 10:36.079
telekinesis.

10:38.015 --> 10:40.650
Is there a history of trouble
between Jordan and Madison?

10:40.684 --> 10:41.651
Not until recently.

10:41.685 --> 10:42.952
I heard a rumor

10:42.986 --> 10:45.054
that Madison and her friends
were harassing Jordan.

10:45.088 --> 10:46.589
I reached out to her,

10:46.624 --> 10:48.625
but she said she would prefer
handling things herself.

10:48.659 --> 10:50.560
Well, if this is how she handles things,

10:50.594 --> 10:52.028
no wonder Kris and Hillary are scared.

10:52.062 --> 10:54.063
We need to speak with Jordan.

10:54.097 --> 10:56.732
I'll have her pulled from class.

10:56.767 --> 10:59.401
Cannot wait to tell Stephen
about this case.

10:59.435 --> 11:01.403
- Hmm?
- Stephen King.

11:01.437 --> 11:03.673
He won't believe it...
a real-life Carrie.

11:03.707 --> 11:05.174
Castle, uh, I can't say

11:05.208 --> 11:08.644
what happened in the cafeteria
or in Madison's bedroom yet.

11:08.679 --> 11:09.812
But I can say this...

11:09.846 --> 11:11.846
the animosity between those two girls

11:11.881 --> 11:14.015
is what makes Jordan
a person of interest

11:14.050 --> 11:16.818
and not your telekinetic fantasy.

11:16.852 --> 11:19.721
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid
that Jordan is gone.

11:19.755 --> 11:21.423
What do you mean she's gone?

11:21.457 --> 11:24.259
It seems a student in her class
came in and told everyone

11:24.294 --> 11:26.295
the NYPD was here asking about Madison.

11:26.329 --> 11:28.963
Jordan got very upset
and left the campus.

11:28.998 --> 11:32.333
Her teacher just called to inform us.

11:32.367 --> 11:33.668
Jordan's still not answering.

11:33.703 --> 11:35.336
It just keeps going right to voicemail.

11:35.370 --> 11:36.838
You sure she's not at my house?

11:36.872 --> 11:39.974
I sent my partner in to check.
She wasn't there.

11:40.009 --> 11:41.542
Ms. Papen, did Jordan ever mention

11:41.577 --> 11:42.811
a Madison Beaumont to you?

11:42.845 --> 11:45.279
No, not that I can remember.

11:45.314 --> 11:47.682
- Was she home last night?
- No.

11:47.716 --> 11:50.318
She was out till after 11:00.

11:50.352 --> 11:52.486
- Out where?
- I don't know.

11:52.521 --> 11:55.489
Look, my brother and his wife
died in a car wreck,

11:55.524 --> 11:56.790
and I took Jordan in.

11:56.825 --> 11:58.125
That's what you do.

11:58.159 --> 12:00.627
But I have two jobs
just to keep us afloat,

12:00.661 --> 12:03.263
and I wasn't home till 8:00,
and she was gone.

12:03.297 --> 12:05.199
How did she seem when she got home?

12:05.233 --> 12:07.201
Quiet, as usual.

12:07.235 --> 12:08.401
We didn't talk much,

12:08.436 --> 12:10.104
and then she just went
straight to her room.

12:10.138 --> 12:12.206
Hey, Javi...

12:12.240 --> 12:13.273
Got a second?

12:13.307 --> 12:16.210
Yeah. Excuse me.

12:16.244 --> 12:18.211
Detective...

12:18.246 --> 12:20.046
I... I know what this looks like,

12:20.080 --> 12:22.815
but... Jordan is a really good kid.

12:22.850 --> 12:24.917
You know, she got a scholarship herself

12:24.952 --> 12:26.786
to that fancy school, and, I mean,

12:26.820 --> 12:29.155
she just... she wouldn't
throw that away, you know?

12:29.189 --> 12:31.391
She... she just wouldn't do this.

12:31.425 --> 12:33.726
Yeah. It was totally Jordan.

12:33.761 --> 12:34.827
No doubt.

12:34.862 --> 12:36.495
But you never actually saw her.

12:36.529 --> 12:38.564
Well, we didn't see anyone.

12:38.598 --> 12:40.133
It was as if some invisible force

12:40.167 --> 12:42.135
threw Madison around the room
like a rag doll.

12:42.169 --> 12:44.703
- The same way Jordan attacked
us in the cafeteria. - Yeah.

12:44.738 --> 12:47.573
After you knocked into her as
she carried a tray full of food.

12:47.607 --> 12:50.842
Look, we know it was wrong of us
to mess with her, but...

12:52.211 --> 12:54.913
I mean, she's odd, you know?

12:54.947 --> 12:57.316
She's into weird stuff.

12:57.350 --> 12:59.285
Comic books?

12:59.319 --> 13:01.019
Yeah, I found them
all over Jordan's room.

13:01.053 --> 13:02.488
Big deal... she's an X-Men fan.

13:02.522 --> 13:04.256
Maybe 'cause she's one of them.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.424
Check it out.

13:06.458 --> 13:08.493
"Telekinesis unleashed."

13:08.527 --> 13:10.461
"Developing telekinetic powers."

13:10.496 --> 13:11.863
"Telekinesis for beginners."

13:11.898 --> 13:15.433
And then... there's this.

13:15.467 --> 13:18.103
- Come on, bro. Let's be serious.
- Yeah?

13:18.137 --> 13:21.439
Is this serious enough for you?

13:21.473 --> 13:23.374
That's our victim.

13:23.409 --> 13:26.377
I found it taped over Jordan's desk.

13:26.412 --> 13:28.846
Was she always into this stuff?

13:28.880 --> 13:31.716
Uh, no. It started a few weeks ago.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.451
She asked for an advance
on her allowance

13:33.485 --> 13:35.186
and then went
and bought all these books.

13:35.220 --> 13:36.587
Why?

13:36.622 --> 13:38.423
What about Jordan's friends?

13:38.457 --> 13:39.790
Would they know where she is?

13:39.825 --> 13:41.325
She doesn't have a lot of friends.

13:41.359 --> 13:43.560
She spends most of her time
in front of her computer.

13:43.594 --> 13:44.829
Do you mind if we take a look at it?

13:44.863 --> 13:46.263
It might help us
find out where she went.

13:46.298 --> 13:47.764
No, that's fine.

13:47.799 --> 13:48.999
Well, she's a teenage girl.

13:49.034 --> 13:50.767
There's got to be somebody
that she's hanging with.

13:50.802 --> 13:52.937
Well, there's one boy
that comes around now and then.

13:52.971 --> 13:55.206
He brought Jordan's homework
to the house when she was sick.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.474
His name is Lucas.

13:57.508 --> 14:01.578
Lucas Troy. And there he is.

14:01.612 --> 14:05.215
Ah, "A Starry Knight"...
the winter ball.

14:05.249 --> 14:08.719
Did I tell you principal Dunnan
expelled me just before prom?

14:08.753 --> 14:11.087
Castle, no! You didn't get to go
to your own prom?

14:11.121 --> 14:13.089
And my date
would've been Audra Dobson...

14:13.123 --> 14:15.258
so unbelievably hot.

14:15.292 --> 14:18.427
Well, if it's any consolation,
I missed my prom as well.

14:18.462 --> 14:19.595
Really? Why?

14:19.629 --> 14:21.331
Lucas Troy?

14:21.365 --> 14:23.266
Hi. I'm detective Kate Beckett.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.101
This is my colleague, Richard Castle.

14:25.135 --> 14:27.770
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah. Ye... s... sorry.

14:29.138 --> 14:31.139
I'm just trying to get this done
for tomorrow's dance.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.675
I've been at it all week.

14:32.709 --> 14:34.149
At this point, the inside of my lungs

14:34.177 --> 14:35.411
are probably cerulean blue.

14:35.445 --> 14:37.413
I'm surprised they're
not postponing the dance.

14:37.447 --> 14:39.982
Madison's parents are insisting
it go on in her memory.

14:40.016 --> 14:42.251
It's amazing... even after she's dead,

14:42.285 --> 14:43.686
everything's still all about her.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.387
Obviously, you're not a fan.

14:45.421 --> 14:47.389
I didn't like how she treated people.

14:47.423 --> 14:48.723
People like Jordan Gibbs.

14:48.758 --> 14:51.126
Yeah, but there's no way
Jordan would retaliate.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.295
The girl wouldn't
raise her hand to anyone.

14:53.329 --> 14:54.763
She didn't have to,

14:54.797 --> 14:56.831
not when she has
flying chairs in her arsenal.

14:56.866 --> 14:58.633
I heard the rumors.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.168
I wasn't there in the cafeteria,

15:00.203 --> 15:02.169
but I'm sure she had
nothing to do with that.

15:02.204 --> 15:04.773
No, but you were in her
first-period class this morning.

15:04.807 --> 15:06.775
- Do you know where she went?
- She didn't say a word to me.

15:06.809 --> 15:08.309
She just... she just took off.

15:08.343 --> 15:10.144
Lucas, we spoke with your teacher.

15:10.178 --> 15:12.480
She said that you left
right after Jordan did.

15:12.515 --> 15:15.316
You were gone for 15 minutes.
Where'd you go?

15:15.350 --> 15:17.318
Look.

15:17.352 --> 15:19.320
I... I could see she was really upset,

15:19.354 --> 15:21.188
so I just wanted to see if she was okay.

15:21.223 --> 15:22.924
So I went after her...

15:22.958 --> 15:27.661
But I lost her, uh, at the
4/5/6 subway station on 86th.

15:27.695 --> 15:31.032
Okay, so, let's start
with the cafeteria video.

15:31.066 --> 15:33.700
There's no indication
that Jordan Gibbs or anyone else

15:33.735 --> 15:36.136
is moving the tables and chairs.

15:36.170 --> 15:38.705
Frankly, I can't explain
what we're seeing here.

15:38.740 --> 15:41.809
Well, I think
I can offer an explanation.

15:41.843 --> 15:44.110
Uh, what about the Facetime call
made to Madison's friends?

15:44.145 --> 15:45.546
Is there any way to retrieve that?

15:45.580 --> 15:47.113
A video call is like a phone call.

15:47.148 --> 15:48.549
Unless someone's recording it,

15:48.583 --> 15:50.884
once the call ends, the data is gone.

15:50.919 --> 15:53.753
As for Jordan's laptop,
browser history suggests

15:53.787 --> 15:56.556
she spent hours obsessing
on all things telekinesis

15:56.590 --> 15:57.924
starting two weeks ago.

15:57.959 --> 15:59.125
Right about the time

15:59.160 --> 16:01.227
she telekinetically rearranged
the cafeteria.

16:01.262 --> 16:02.963
Clearly, Jordan realized she had powers

16:02.997 --> 16:04.530
and was trying to understand them.

16:04.565 --> 16:06.766
This is exactly like the movie "Carrie."

16:06.800 --> 16:09.034
Yes, exactly like the movie...
fictional.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.536
Jordan doesn't have powers.

16:10.571 --> 16:11.637
Hey.

16:11.672 --> 16:13.506
Got Jordan's phone records.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.575
Her service provider says that
her phone's been turned off,

16:15.609 --> 16:17.409
but she made one call
right when she ditched school.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.412
- To who?
- Number's listed to a Henderson Diagnostics,

16:20.447 --> 16:22.648
and I can't find any info
on what they do, exactly.

16:22.683 --> 16:24.450
But when I called, there was no answer,

16:24.484 --> 16:25.985
no voicemail or message, either.

16:26.019 --> 16:29.821
- Did you get an address?
- Uh, yeah... Brooklyn, off the 4/5 line.

16:31.257 --> 16:34.093
What was Jordan doing
all the way out here?

16:34.127 --> 16:36.895
I mean, it's miles away from
her house, the school, uh...

16:36.929 --> 16:38.797
Just because nobody knows
who Jordan's friends are

16:38.831 --> 16:40.192
doesn't mean she doesn't have any.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.200
And her friends hang out
in a place like this?

16:44.570 --> 16:46.404
Hi.

16:46.438 --> 16:49.240
NYPD. I'd like to ask you a few que...

16:49.274 --> 16:50.775
Y... you must be here for the doctor.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.711
He's in session now.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.479
Follow me.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.584
Excuse me. NYPD.

17:00.619 --> 17:02.887
We're looking...

17:02.921 --> 17:05.723
for...

17:09.395 --> 17:11.529
I think we're in the right place.

17:20.732 --> 17:24.280
- How did you do that?
- The power of a focused mind.

17:24.319 --> 17:25.987
Yeah, I saw that trick in Vegas.

17:26.021 --> 17:28.122
So, who are you? What is this place?

17:28.156 --> 17:31.125
I am Dr. Rampanel.

17:31.160 --> 17:34.529
And this place is my lab,
and what I do is not magic.

17:34.564 --> 17:36.197
So, then, what is it?

17:36.231 --> 17:38.299
I teach biophysics at M.I.T.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.134
I rent this space from Henderson

17:40.169 --> 17:42.336
to conduct my research in telekinesis.

17:42.371 --> 17:44.539
You study telekinesis?

17:44.573 --> 17:47.308
I teach people
how to unlock their potential.

17:47.342 --> 17:48.509
For a fee, I'm guessing.

17:48.544 --> 17:50.211
If they pay you enough,

17:50.245 --> 17:52.113
you make them believe they're special.

17:52.147 --> 17:54.514
I see you're a skeptic.

17:54.549 --> 17:56.183
Most ungifted are.

17:56.217 --> 17:59.019
What can you tell us about Jordan Gibbs?

17:59.054 --> 18:00.888
Ah, yes. Jordan.

18:00.922 --> 18:04.124
She came by last week, I think,
to have herself evaluated.

18:04.158 --> 18:06.727
How did she do? Uh, let me guess...

18:06.761 --> 18:08.062
off the charts.

18:08.096 --> 18:10.330
I really can't discuss my findings.

18:10.364 --> 18:11.731
Last week?

18:11.765 --> 18:14.401
But she called here this morning.

18:14.435 --> 18:17.537
In fact, she did, yes.

18:17.572 --> 18:19.872
And... what did she say?

18:19.907 --> 18:21.241
Uh, she was frightened.

18:21.275 --> 18:24.344
You see, Jordan doesn't yet know
how to control her powers.

18:24.378 --> 18:26.045
So, did she come here to see you?

18:26.080 --> 18:28.414
Yes. But she's gone now.

18:28.448 --> 18:30.783
You're lying.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.919
And if you don't tell me the truth,

18:32.953 --> 18:35.021
I will arrest you for obstruction

18:35.055 --> 18:37.090
- and harboring a fugitive...
- Stop.

18:37.124 --> 18:38.658
Leave him alone.

18:38.692 --> 18:40.326
He's just trying to protect me.

18:45.465 --> 18:47.099
She even kind of looks like Carrie.

18:47.134 --> 18:48.334
No, she does not!

18:48.368 --> 18:50.002
Besides, how would
that little, skinny girl

18:50.036 --> 18:52.004
throw Madison up against the ceiling?

18:52.038 --> 18:55.341
With powers we have yet to comprehend.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.876
Be careful in there. Don't anger her.

18:57.910 --> 19:00.045
We don't know what she's capable of.

19:00.079 --> 19:01.913
You're right.

19:01.948 --> 19:04.449
You should probably
go in there with me...

19:04.483 --> 19:06.121
for protection.

19:08.988 --> 19:12.290
You're a hard girl to find, Jordan.

19:12.324 --> 19:15.226
I had to get away from Faircroft.

19:15.261 --> 19:16.961
Everyone was whispering about

19:16.995 --> 19:19.997
how I was the one who killed Madison.

19:20.032 --> 19:23.668
And why would they say that?

19:23.702 --> 19:27.004
Is it because Madison was your Nemesis?

19:27.039 --> 19:28.406
She didn't used to be.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.642
For the longest time,

19:30.676 --> 19:35.412
I was invisible to Madison
and her bitch clique...

19:35.446 --> 19:38.415
just like I am to most people.

19:38.449 --> 19:40.384
And then, last month,

19:40.418 --> 19:42.853
first morning back after winter break,

19:42.888 --> 19:44.855
I was in the library reading,

19:44.890 --> 19:47.624
and I ran into her
in the Russian lit section.

19:47.659 --> 19:49.025
And she got all pissed,

19:49.060 --> 19:51.027
saying I couldn't tell anyone
that I'd seen her there.

19:51.062 --> 19:53.630
- What was she angry about?
- I have no idea.

19:53.665 --> 19:55.599
Maybe she didn't want anyone to know

19:55.633 --> 19:57.100
that she actually studies.

19:57.134 --> 20:01.071
But then, later that day,
Madison started messing with me,

20:01.105 --> 20:02.573
and it just got worse from there.

20:02.607 --> 20:04.575
So you pulled that stunt
in the cafeteria

20:04.609 --> 20:06.142
to make her scared of you.

20:06.177 --> 20:07.744
I just wanted them to stop!

20:07.778 --> 20:10.346
Is that why you killed Madison?

20:10.380 --> 20:13.349
I guess so! I... I don't know!

20:24.528 --> 20:26.662
It's a nervous habit.

20:29.333 --> 20:31.089
Jordan, there's no guessing here.

20:31.132 --> 20:34.167
Either you did
or you didn't kill Madison.

20:34.201 --> 20:36.201
I got so angry...

20:36.236 --> 20:39.839
And stuff just started flying
around the cafeteria.

20:39.873 --> 20:41.807
And then I wished
for Madison to be dead,

20:41.842 --> 20:43.509
and the next thing I knew, she was!

20:43.544 --> 20:46.512
It had to be me, right?

20:46.547 --> 20:49.015
Where were you between
8:00 and 10:00 P.M. last night?

20:49.049 --> 20:53.052
I was studying
at Lulu's Café in Astoria.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.489
We're gonna have to kick her loose.

20:57.524 --> 21:00.459
Waitress confirmed that Jordan was
at the café in Queens till 11:00.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.161
So she couldn't have killed Madison.

21:02.195 --> 21:04.396
Not with her bare hands, but who knows

21:04.431 --> 21:07.166
how far her secret
telekinetic powers might reach?

21:07.200 --> 21:08.667
Well, it turns out our victim

21:08.701 --> 21:10.468
might've had some secrets of her own.

21:10.502 --> 21:12.503
Did you track down whoever
Madison was seeing?

21:12.538 --> 21:14.606
As far as I can tell,
she wasn't seeing anybody.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.808
But these are her financials.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.678
- What kind of high-school kid has
financials? - Madison does.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.512
She had a dozen credit cards,

21:21.547 --> 21:25.249
and she was wearing them out...
Hermès handbags, Jimmy Choos.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.318
I'm talking
tens of thousands of dollars.

21:27.352 --> 21:29.153
So what? Her parents were loaded.

21:29.188 --> 21:30.354
Yeah, but mommy and daddy

21:30.389 --> 21:32.056
weren't springing for any of this stuff.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.691
The cards were in Madison's name,

21:33.725 --> 21:35.626
paid off every month through
her own secret bank account.

21:35.660 --> 21:37.128
So where was this money coming from?

21:37.162 --> 21:38.723
That's what we're trying to figure out.

21:38.730 --> 21:41.399
Plus, there's more...
a slew of credit-card charges

21:41.433 --> 21:44.367
for late-night cab rides
and convenience-store purchases.

21:44.402 --> 21:46.336
Well, and that fits with what
Madison's ex-boyfriend said

21:46.370 --> 21:47.638
about her staying out to all hours.

21:47.672 --> 21:49.506
Okay, maybe she was going out,
hitting the clubs.

21:49.540 --> 21:51.108
Yeah, but on weeknights?

21:51.142 --> 21:52.843
And there are
no bar or club charges here.

21:52.877 --> 21:54.177
And look at this.

21:54.212 --> 21:56.780
Remember how Jordan said
her troubles with Madison began

21:56.815 --> 21:59.516
when school started back up
with that run-in at the library?

21:59.550 --> 22:01.084
According to this taxi charge,

22:01.119 --> 22:04.020
Madison was out and about
that same morning at 5:00 A.M.

22:04.054 --> 22:06.856
Okay, so, she was going straight
to school from wherever she was.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.558
But why would she stay out all night

22:08.593 --> 22:10.093
and then go to the school library?

22:10.128 --> 22:13.363
What was she doing she didn't
want Jordan to know about?

22:13.397 --> 22:16.298
Students use their I.D.s to
swipe in and out of the library.

22:16.333 --> 22:18.501
These are all the times Madison Beaumont

22:18.535 --> 22:20.603
entered and exited
during this entire school year.

22:20.638 --> 22:22.204
Thank you.

22:22.239 --> 22:24.907
Okay, so, each one of Madison's
early-morning visits

22:24.942 --> 22:27.677
to the library happened
after one of her all-nighters.

22:27.711 --> 22:30.379
She swiped in and out within 5 minutes.

22:30.413 --> 22:33.382
I'm guessing she wasn't hanging
out in Russian lit to study.

22:33.416 --> 22:35.826
Castle, Russian literature...
it's right here.

22:35.858 --> 22:37.292
Thank God for the Kindle,

22:37.326 --> 22:39.895
or I'd be out of a job
in a couple of years.

22:39.929 --> 22:43.164
Kids just don't read
actual books anymore.

22:43.199 --> 22:45.742
Unless it's "Voyna I Mir"...

22:45.766 --> 22:47.367
"War And Peace,"
in its original Russian.

22:47.402 --> 22:49.769
And look... there's no dust here.

22:49.804 --> 22:52.572
It's like someone
pulled this out recently.

22:52.606 --> 22:55.742
And it's lighter
than I remember Tolstoy being.

23:01.290 --> 23:03.057
Are these bank notes?

23:03.092 --> 23:04.792
These are bonds.

23:04.826 --> 23:07.561
These are bearer bonds,
issued by the German government.

23:07.596 --> 23:10.131
These are payable to the bearer,
no questions asked.

23:10.165 --> 23:11.299
German bearer bonds?

23:11.333 --> 23:12.900
I thought that only existed
in "Die Hard."

23:12.934 --> 23:15.569
How did Madison get her hands on these?

23:15.604 --> 23:18.339
I don't know, but there's over
a million dollars' worth here.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.750
No, there must be some mistake.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.407
She may have applied
for some credit cards,

23:30.431 --> 23:32.228
but there's no way
Madison had a bank account

23:32.259 --> 23:33.721
with this much cash in it.

23:33.768 --> 23:35.470
There's no mistake, Mr. Beaumont.

23:35.504 --> 23:37.904
A... and this money is just
the tip of the iceberg.

23:37.939 --> 23:39.473
Well, aside from the shopping sprees,

23:39.507 --> 23:41.708
we found some odd charges
on your daughter's credit cards

23:41.742 --> 23:43.377
over the past few months.

23:43.411 --> 23:46.592
For cab rides taken
during the middle of the night.

23:46.632 --> 23:47.766
Do you have any idea

23:47.800 --> 23:49.468
what she was doing
or where she was going?

23:49.502 --> 23:51.470
These charges are for weeknights.

23:51.504 --> 23:53.171
School nights.

23:53.205 --> 23:54.572
So you weren't aware of this.

23:54.606 --> 23:57.875
No, Madison was in bed
by 11:00 every night, or...

23:57.909 --> 23:59.577
we thought she was.

23:59.611 --> 24:01.912
Do you think
she got mixed up in something,

24:01.947 --> 24:04.548
and... that's the reason she died?

24:04.583 --> 24:06.217
We don't know.

24:06.251 --> 24:08.552
But we did find something else
in the school library.

24:08.587 --> 24:09.753
Inside of a hollowed-out book

24:09.788 --> 24:11.455
with your daughter's
fingerprints all over it.

24:11.490 --> 24:12.656
What did you find?

24:15.533 --> 24:18.529
$2.3 million in German bearer bonds.

24:18.563 --> 24:21.799
Bearer bonds?

24:21.833 --> 24:24.167
Are these your bearer bonds,
Mr. Beaumont?

24:24.202 --> 24:27.471
Uh, no. No.

24:27.505 --> 24:29.585
Do you know where your daughter
could've gotten them?

24:31.509 --> 24:32.775
Charles?

24:32.810 --> 24:35.445
No. Um, I'm sorry.

24:35.480 --> 24:36.846
We can't help you.

24:36.881 --> 24:39.416
Come on, Diane. We're done here.

24:45.850 --> 24:46.949
There's no question

24:46.984 --> 24:48.704
Madison's dad knew about
those bearer bonds.

24:48.719 --> 24:51.454
Okay, if they have something
to do with his daughter's death,

24:51.489 --> 24:53.690
then why wouldn't he want
to tell us about them?

24:53.724 --> 24:55.492
We're not gonna know until
we know where they came from.

24:55.526 --> 24:57.327
We're tracking the serial
numbers on the bonds

24:57.361 --> 24:58.895
to see if we can locate
the original owners,

24:58.929 --> 25:00.129
but it's gonna take some time.

25:02.198 --> 25:05.001
What the hell was this girl mixed up in?

25:05.035 --> 25:08.504
And what does it have to do
with Jordan's telekinesis?

25:10.040 --> 25:13.009
Nothing, because Jordan
is not telekinetic.

25:13.043 --> 25:15.511
Well, explain that cafeteria video.

25:15.546 --> 25:17.246
I can't, Castle.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.714
But I assure you, I will.

25:19.749 --> 25:21.883
And what about Madison's death...

25:21.918 --> 25:25.187
being thrown around like
a rag doll by an unseen force?

25:25.221 --> 25:27.523
Yeah, well, unseen doesn't mean
that nobody was there.

25:27.557 --> 25:29.758
And the real question
that we should be asking

25:29.792 --> 25:31.326
is what is a 17-year-old doing

25:31.361 --> 25:34.563
with $2.3 million in bearer bonds?

25:34.597 --> 25:38.934
That probably got her killed,
not some psychic assassin.

25:38.968 --> 25:41.636
Well, perhaps we'll have to
agree to disagree on that,

25:41.671 --> 25:43.237
and agree to agree on this.

25:47.176 --> 25:51.279
"The Billboard's top 100 most
romantic songs of all time."

25:51.313 --> 25:54.115
I figure our song has got to be
on that list somewhere.

25:54.149 --> 25:57.185
No, Castle, I'm not choosing
our song off of a list

25:57.219 --> 26:00.288
that includes Def Leppard's
"Pour Some Sugar On Me."

26:00.322 --> 26:02.623
Uh, that song, I am sure,

26:02.657 --> 26:06.627
ignited many
a strip-club romance in 1987.

26:06.661 --> 26:08.629
1987...

26:08.663 --> 26:10.965
A year when The Bangles

26:10.999 --> 26:13.233
taught us how to walk like an Egyptian,

26:13.267 --> 26:16.737
Bon Jovi taught us how to live
on nothing but a prayer,

26:16.771 --> 26:19.139
and Rick Astley taught us how to laugh.

26:19.173 --> 26:20.340
You're feeling nostalgic

26:20.374 --> 26:22.076
after getting pulled back in time

26:22.110 --> 26:23.710
to your days at Faircroft Prep.

26:23.744 --> 26:26.346
Yeah, it was strange going back.

26:26.380 --> 26:29.483
Everything seems smaller, yet unchanged.

26:29.517 --> 26:31.585
I mean, the hallways are the same.

26:31.619 --> 26:33.086
The principal is the same.

26:33.121 --> 26:36.089
Same banners for school dances.

26:36.124 --> 26:38.125
A... and why didn't you go to your prom?

26:38.159 --> 26:40.259
I'm sure a 17-year-old Katherine Beckett

26:40.293 --> 26:41.928
had many a young suitor.

26:41.962 --> 26:44.931
Yeah, except rebel Becks
was a little too cool

26:44.965 --> 26:46.565
to go to a silly dance, so...

26:46.600 --> 26:50.503
We went to a poetry slam
in the East Village instead.

26:50.537 --> 26:52.538
It was one of those seminal moments

26:52.572 --> 26:54.841
that I kind of wish
I didn't skip out on.

26:54.875 --> 26:56.509
To the things we missed.

26:56.543 --> 26:58.210
And to those we didn't.

27:06.219 --> 27:08.521
All right, get back to me
as soon as you can.

27:08.555 --> 27:11.290
Hey! So, still no word
on the bearer bonds,

27:11.324 --> 27:12.724
but it's looking more and more

27:12.759 --> 27:15.160
like Madison's extracurriculars
were of a criminal nature.

27:15.194 --> 27:18.030
- What'd you find?
- It's what CSU found...

27:18.064 --> 27:19.798
an antique ring.

27:19.832 --> 27:22.600
It was at the back of the shelf
at the library.

27:22.635 --> 27:23.769
Must've slipped out of the book.

27:23.803 --> 27:25.103
But we were able to I.D. it

27:25.138 --> 27:26.972
as having been stolen
in a burglary a few weeks ago.

27:27.006 --> 27:28.306
Who did this ring belong to?

27:28.340 --> 27:30.508
Uh, to the mom of a kid
who attends Faircroft.

27:30.543 --> 27:32.510
Turns out that a dozen
Faircroft families

27:32.545 --> 27:34.512
have been burglarized
over the past 3 months,

27:34.547 --> 27:35.628
mainly watches and jewelry.

27:35.648 --> 27:37.328
Let me guess...
the dates of the burglaries

27:37.349 --> 27:39.150
match the dates
that Madison was out all night.

27:39.185 --> 27:40.218
Bingo.

27:40.252 --> 27:41.719
She must've fenced what she stole,

27:41.753 --> 27:43.721
which explains why she was able
to pay off her credit cards.

27:43.755 --> 27:44.789
It also explains

27:44.823 --> 27:46.590
the early-morning visits to the library.

27:46.624 --> 27:49.626
She'd stash her haul in Tolstoy
after each burglary,

27:49.661 --> 27:50.995
and if anyone caught on to her,

27:51.029 --> 27:52.596
they'd never be able to find the loot.

27:52.630 --> 27:53.830
And if they did find the loot,

27:53.832 --> 27:55.566
they wouldn't be able
to connect it to her.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.334
Well, I checked with all
of Madison's friends at school.

27:57.368 --> 27:59.003
None of them seem to know
what she was up to.

27:59.037 --> 28:00.771
Hey, hey. Got a hit
on those bearer bonds.

28:00.806 --> 28:02.673
Turns out, they were stolen months ago

28:02.707 --> 28:04.841
in an armed robbery
of a bank in Floral Park.

28:04.875 --> 28:06.610
The crew cleaned out
the safety deposit boxes.

28:06.644 --> 28:07.911
Hold up, are you saying

28:07.945 --> 28:09.905
that a 17-year-old
prep-school girl robbed a bank?

28:09.914 --> 28:12.749
No, but she might've robbed
the guy who robbed the bank.

28:12.783 --> 28:14.518
According to the police report,

28:14.552 --> 28:17.120
the prime suspect in the bank robbery

28:17.154 --> 28:20.924
was one Xiangzu Chen,

28:20.958 --> 28:23.993
a former triad enforcer who went
into business for himself.

28:24.028 --> 28:26.696
Now, the D.A. had enough
evidence to indict him,

28:26.731 --> 28:29.032
but his defense attorney
got him off on a technicality.

28:29.066 --> 28:30.466
The bonds were never recovered.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.535
And how does any of this
connect with Madison?

28:32.569 --> 28:34.170
Look who his defense attorney is.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.773
Charles Beaumont, Madison's father?

28:37.807 --> 28:39.675
Madison must've heard about
the bonds from her dad,

28:39.710 --> 28:41.744
where Chen was hiding them,
and how much they were worth.

28:41.778 --> 28:43.646
That's a huge score for a budding thief.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.549
And if Chen found out
that his lawyer's little girl

28:46.583 --> 28:48.417
stole $2.3 million from him...

28:48.452 --> 28:51.120
It'd be motive to bash her skull
against the ceiling.

29:02.032 --> 29:04.515
Yo, Beckett, we got a problem.

29:04.555 --> 29:06.488
- Chen's gone.
- He went into hiding?

29:06.523 --> 29:08.357
He put his house on the market,
and he moved out yesterday.

29:08.391 --> 29:10.492
That doesn't sound like
the actions of an innocent man.

29:10.527 --> 29:11.560
Where did he go?

29:11.594 --> 29:12.794
We're trying to track him down,

29:12.795 --> 29:14.096
but no one in his family's talking.

29:14.130 --> 29:15.597
Ryan's bringing in his realtor right now

29:15.631 --> 29:16.952
to see if she knows where he went.

29:16.966 --> 29:20.335
No. No, I have no idea where he is.

29:20.370 --> 29:22.003
All I know is he was willing

29:22.038 --> 29:24.406
to take a huge loss
to close immediately.

29:24.441 --> 29:26.274
He just wanted the house out of his name

29:26.308 --> 29:27.709
and the cash in his account.

29:27.743 --> 29:29.410
Where were you
supposed to send the money?

29:29.445 --> 29:32.447
He gave me a routing number
to a bank in China.

29:32.481 --> 29:34.282
Did he give you any reason

29:34.316 --> 29:36.851
why he was looking to unload so quickly?

29:36.886 --> 29:39.420
Well, he said he needed
the money for business reasons,

29:39.455 --> 29:41.422
but I could tell
he was hiding something.

29:41.457 --> 29:45.159
It's my job to know everything
about every home I sell,

29:45.194 --> 29:48.196
so I asked around.

29:48.230 --> 29:52.032
Apparently, Mr. Chen is very superstitious,

29:52.067 --> 29:56.036
- and according to the neighbors, something
happened. - What?

29:56.071 --> 29:57.205
Well, I don't know

29:57.239 --> 29:59.073
what they're putting
in the water out there,

29:59.107 --> 30:01.341
but according to the next-door neighbor,

30:01.375 --> 30:03.410
something chased Mr. Chen and his men

30:03.444 --> 30:05.345
out of the house a few nights ago.

30:05.379 --> 30:09.617
- What do you mean, "something"?
- Some thing, as in...

30:09.651 --> 30:11.619
A ghost?

30:11.653 --> 30:14.387
This neighbor said
that he looked out his window,

30:14.422 --> 30:17.557
and all of the patio furniture
was flying around the yard.

30:17.592 --> 30:19.392
It scared the hell out of Mr. Chen.

30:19.427 --> 30:21.995
He and his men left the house,
and he never returned.

30:22.029 --> 30:25.632
Obviously, that detail
was left out of the listing.

30:27.168 --> 30:29.536
So, Chen didn't just leave his house.

30:29.570 --> 30:31.070
He left the country.

30:31.105 --> 30:34.240
TSA confirms that he was
on a flight to Shanghai

30:34.274 --> 30:35.675
when Madison was murdered.

30:35.709 --> 30:38.477
- He's not our killer.
- Tell me again why he left the country.

30:41.649 --> 30:43.082
What?

30:43.117 --> 30:44.884
Well, you're not gonna want
to hear this,

30:44.918 --> 30:46.653
but I followed up with Chen's neighbors.

30:46.687 --> 30:48.720
Now, several confirmed seeing

30:48.755 --> 30:51.557
what can only be described
as a telekinetic event

30:51.591 --> 30:53.892
at Chen's property three nights ago.

30:53.926 --> 30:56.728
And remind me
how stolen German bearer bonds

30:56.763 --> 30:58.330
have nothing to do with telekinesis.

30:58.365 --> 31:00.999
You know, there's a logical
explanation, okay?

31:01.034 --> 31:03.101
I'd love to hear it.

31:04.704 --> 31:05.904
Okay, fine.

31:05.938 --> 31:09.240
Uh, Madison knew that those
bonds are in Chen's house.

31:09.275 --> 31:12.243
Her father is, after all, his lawyer.

31:12.278 --> 31:14.746
Um, so, she's looking
for the next big score.

31:14.781 --> 31:16.815
She decides to scope out the house,

31:16.849 --> 31:20.185
except Chen's guards
are around all the time.

31:20.219 --> 31:22.887
So, knowing that Chen is superstitious,

31:22.921 --> 31:25.156
she stages a supernatural event

31:25.191 --> 31:27.392
to scare everyone out of the house.

31:27.426 --> 31:30.061
That's actually really... logical.

31:30.095 --> 31:31.196
Thank you.

31:31.230 --> 31:33.150
But what about the other
events... the cafeteria?

31:33.165 --> 31:34.799
Dry run, to see
if she could pull it off.

31:34.833 --> 31:36.834
And her own death...
did she stage that, too?

31:39.604 --> 31:42.139
- Ah.
- Okay, fine. All right. You're right.

31:42.174 --> 31:44.075
Um, Madison couldn't have
done this alone.

31:44.109 --> 31:45.475
So someone else was involved.

31:45.510 --> 31:47.644
You know what? Madison
had to have had a partner.

31:47.679 --> 31:50.547
You're right... a partner
with telekinetic abilities.

31:50.582 --> 31:53.217
Or someone with the ability to fake it.

31:53.251 --> 31:56.353
And when Madison wouldn't share,
the partner went after her.

31:56.387 --> 31:59.823
So we find Madison's partner,
we'll find the killer.

31:59.857 --> 32:01.491
Hey. Just heard back from CSU.

32:01.526 --> 32:03.993
They recovered a number
of prints in Chen's house.

32:04.028 --> 32:05.596
Matched a set to Madison.

32:05.630 --> 32:06.863
And to Jordan?

32:06.897 --> 32:08.699
Not yet, but they're still in process.

32:08.733 --> 32:10.100
They also examined the patio

32:10.134 --> 32:12.435
where Chen's furniture
earned its frequent-flyer miles.

32:12.469 --> 32:13.636
Found shoe prints with traces

32:13.670 --> 32:15.404
of blue, iridescent spray paint on them.

32:15.439 --> 32:18.374
Let me guess... cerulean blue.

32:21.162 --> 32:23.122
Ooh! Can you freeze that?
Look there, on the left.

32:23.147 --> 32:25.648
Let me see if I can zoom in.

32:25.682 --> 32:28.384
It's him! It's Lucas.
He was at the cafeteria.

32:28.418 --> 32:31.019
And apparently at Chen's place,
based on that paint.

32:31.054 --> 32:34.056
So, Lucas was the one
with the power and not Jordan.

32:34.090 --> 32:35.691
Yeah, the power to stage these events.

32:35.726 --> 32:37.426
But why would he be
Madison's accomplice?

32:37.461 --> 32:39.562
- He said that he hated her.
- Maybe he came to hate her.

32:39.596 --> 32:41.230
That's why he killed her.

32:41.265 --> 32:42.598
And with everyone assuming

32:42.633 --> 32:45.400
that Jordan was the one
with the telekinetic abilities,

32:45.434 --> 32:47.870
what better way
to throw people off his scent?

32:50.306 --> 32:52.440
This is it.

32:52.475 --> 32:54.243
That gun's not gonna be much help

32:54.277 --> 32:56.678
when Lucas rips it
from your hand with his mind.

32:56.712 --> 32:58.513
Castle, for the last time,

32:58.547 --> 33:01.015
telekinesis is not r...

33:04.353 --> 33:06.388
You were saying?

33:06.422 --> 33:07.789
Come on.

33:07.823 --> 33:10.091
We're gonna finally figure out
what's going on here.

33:14.196 --> 33:15.797
Don't move.

33:15.831 --> 33:17.464
It's not what you think.

33:22.637 --> 33:24.205
Don't hurt her.

33:25.774 --> 33:28.609
She had nothing to do with this.

33:28.643 --> 33:31.279
It's all my fault.

33:40.375 --> 33:41.976
I never meant for any of this to happen.

33:41.993 --> 33:43.473
I never meant for anyone to get hurt.

33:43.489 --> 33:45.455
So, what we saw at your house,

33:45.490 --> 33:48.158
that event at the cafeteria...
that was you?

33:49.547 --> 33:51.738
Yeah. You must think I'm a freak, huh?

33:51.772 --> 33:54.608
Uh...
how did you do it?

33:54.642 --> 33:56.843
You wouldn't understand.
Most people don't.

33:56.877 --> 33:59.012
That's why I've learned
to hide what I am.

33:59.046 --> 34:00.013
Telekinetic.

34:00.047 --> 34:02.015
What?

34:02.049 --> 34:03.950
No... smart.

34:03.985 --> 34:07.087
You know, people don't like it
when you're smart,

34:07.121 --> 34:09.388
when you do things
that people don't understand.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.424
I mean, all that stuff
you saw, I rigged.

34:11.458 --> 34:14.761
Rigged? But you made
the chairs move, the tables!

34:14.795 --> 34:17.597
Right. Special effects
are kind of my hobby.

34:17.630 --> 34:19.031
It's pretty amazing, actually,

34:19.065 --> 34:21.634
what you can do with, like,
some fishing wire and magnets.

34:21.668 --> 34:23.503
And people are pretty gullible.

34:23.536 --> 34:27.906
Now, when I saw those girls
being so mean to Jordan,

34:27.940 --> 34:30.109
I just... I just wanted
to make them stop.

34:30.143 --> 34:31.944
And I figured
if I make them afraid of her,

34:31.978 --> 34:33.446
they'll leave her alone, you know?

34:33.480 --> 34:35.714
So, then, you faked the whole

34:35.748 --> 34:38.016
telekinetic event at the cafeteria.

34:38.051 --> 34:40.318
Yeah.

34:40.353 --> 34:42.320
What's going to happen to him?

34:42.355 --> 34:45.489
That all depends on what he did.

34:45.525 --> 34:48.761
He was just trying to protect me.

34:52.498 --> 34:53.665
I've never had anyone

34:53.699 --> 34:55.766
do anything like that for me before.

34:59.672 --> 35:01.139
And it worked.

35:01.174 --> 35:04.809
I convinced everybody... except Madison.

35:04.843 --> 35:06.478
She, uh, figured out what I'd done,

35:06.512 --> 35:08.379
and then she threatened to... to...

35:08.413 --> 35:10.314
to turn me in to the administration

35:10.348 --> 35:11.515
if I didn't help her.

35:11.550 --> 35:12.784
And you know... you know...

35:12.818 --> 35:15.219
you know what they would do
to a scholarship kid

35:15.253 --> 35:17.221
who terrorized a room full of students?

35:17.255 --> 35:20.058
- What did she ask you to do?
- Well...

35:20.092 --> 35:22.393
there was a house in,
uh... in Westchester,

35:22.427 --> 35:24.595
and she said she needed to get inside.

35:24.629 --> 35:26.664
And I was supposed to create a diversion

35:26.698 --> 35:27.831
to scare the owner out.

35:27.865 --> 35:29.533
Do you know what she was after
in the house?

35:29.568 --> 35:31.935
No. No idea. I just wanted
to do whatever she said

35:31.969 --> 35:33.571
so I could get on with my life.

35:33.605 --> 35:35.372
Which is why you killed her...
because she wouldn't let you.

35:35.407 --> 35:37.508
No, I... I didn't... I didn't kill anybody!

35:37.542 --> 35:39.543
Lucas, Madison was on a Facetime call

35:39.578 --> 35:40.643
when she was killed.

35:40.678 --> 35:42.645
Witnesses reported an invisible force

35:42.680 --> 35:44.280
tossing her around the room.

35:44.315 --> 35:46.750
They described it
as a telekinetic event.

35:46.784 --> 35:48.952
Now, you just admitted to motive.

35:48.986 --> 35:51.054
And out of all of our suspects,

35:51.089 --> 35:53.556
you're the only one capable
of pulling that off.

35:53.591 --> 35:55.491
Yeah.

35:55.526 --> 35:57.860
Yeah, you're right.
I did pull that off...

35:57.894 --> 35:59.229
with Madison.

36:01.898 --> 36:04.234
It was the first thing
Madison forced me to do.

36:04.268 --> 36:07.537
See, I made it look and sound
like a Facetime call,

36:07.571 --> 36:09.038
but it's... it's just a video.

36:09.072 --> 36:10.707
Apparently, one of her friends

36:10.741 --> 36:13.776
was pretty disturbed
by the cafeteria stunt,

36:13.810 --> 36:16.645
so she did this to really freak her out.

36:16.679 --> 36:18.214
<i>Aah!</i>

36:18.248 --> 36:20.682
Exactly how her friends describe it.

36:23.820 --> 36:26.421
Now, here's just the end,
with no effects.

36:26.456 --> 36:28.991
<i>- How was that?</i>
<i>- That looked good.</i>

36:29.025 --> 36:30.992
<i>Let's play it back.</i>

36:31.026 --> 36:33.161
<i>She is so gonna freak</i>
<i>when she sees this.</i>

36:33.195 --> 36:34.663
<i>She'll think your psycho sweetheart</i>

36:34.697 --> 36:35.997
<i>is coming for her next.</i>

36:36.031 --> 36:40.335
<i>All right, loser.</i>
<i>Help me get this harness off.</i>

36:40.370 --> 36:41.836
When did you make this?

36:41.871 --> 36:43.338
Uh, last week.

36:43.373 --> 36:46.174
I edited that last part out
and e-mailed it to Madison.

36:46.208 --> 36:48.042
Our killer must've gotten
their hands on this.

36:48.077 --> 36:49.678
They used the video to cover their crime

36:49.711 --> 36:51.012
by making witnesses believe

36:51.046 --> 36:52.480
they were watching the murder live.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.482
Who else knew about this video?

36:54.516 --> 36:56.717
Uh, as far as I know, just me, Madison,

36:56.752 --> 36:59.654
and whichever bitch friend
Madison pranked with this.

37:01.657 --> 37:05.025
So, then, that friend is our killer.

37:14.403 --> 37:16.003
Mind if I cut in?

37:18.607 --> 37:20.327
Principal Dunnan, what's going on?

37:20.341 --> 37:22.142
I should ask you two that.

37:22.177 --> 37:24.444
We found these inside your lockers,

37:24.478 --> 37:27.181
hidden under a false bottom inside.

37:27.215 --> 37:29.183
Care to explain?

37:29.217 --> 37:31.051
Let me help you.

37:31.085 --> 37:32.419
It's all stolen property

37:32.453 --> 37:35.355
from thefts
connected to Madison Beaumont.

37:35.389 --> 37:37.524
The two of you were partners
in her little bling ring.

37:37.558 --> 37:39.626
At least Madison was smart enough

37:39.660 --> 37:42.195
not to hide her stolen stash
in her locker.

37:42.229 --> 37:43.996
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:44.031 --> 37:45.632
I've never seen that stuff before.

37:45.666 --> 37:46.633
I think you have.

37:46.667 --> 37:48.568
We've matched each one of those items

37:48.602 --> 37:49.936
to property that was stolen

37:49.970 --> 37:52.238
from families that have
students enrolled here.

37:52.272 --> 37:53.772
And we matched your movements

37:53.807 --> 37:56.375
to the times when the burglaries
were committed.

37:56.409 --> 37:57.844
It's bad enough you stole,

37:57.878 --> 37:59.611
but from the Faircroft community?

37:59.646 --> 38:01.247
Don't say a word. My dad's a lawyer.

38:01.281 --> 38:02.681
He can get us out of anything.

38:02.716 --> 38:05.284
- Even murder?
- Murder?

38:05.319 --> 38:06.853
You must've felt betrayed

38:06.887 --> 38:09.187
when Madison went after
those bearer bonds alone.

38:09.222 --> 38:11.724
Score of a lifetime,
and she shut you out.

38:11.758 --> 38:13.759
- Is that why you killed her?
- Hello?

38:13.793 --> 38:16.528
We were halfway across town
when that happened.

38:16.563 --> 38:17.763
There are witnesses.

38:17.797 --> 38:19.197
We saw her being killed
on that Facetime call.

38:19.232 --> 38:20.566
You mean this call?

38:21.934 --> 38:23.736
<i>She is so gonna freak</i>
<i>when she sees this.</i>

38:23.770 --> 38:25.337
<i>She'll think your psycho sweetheart</i>

38:25.371 --> 38:26.537
<i>is coming for her next.</i>

38:26.572 --> 38:28.073
- Oh, my God.
<i>- All right, loser.</i>

38:28.107 --> 38:31.409
<i>Help me get this harness off.</i>

38:31.443 --> 38:33.979
What you saw
was a pre-recorded joke video

38:34.013 --> 38:35.914
that Madison made.

38:35.948 --> 38:38.383
By the time you watched it,
she was already dead.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.617
Our killer used it as an alibi

38:39.618 --> 38:41.498
to make it look like she was
halfway across town

38:41.520 --> 38:42.587
when the murder happened.

38:42.621 --> 38:44.822
She also witnessed it
alongside a friend.

38:44.857 --> 38:47.324
So what you thought was a Facetime call

38:47.359 --> 38:50.227
was actually a video...

38:50.262 --> 38:51.596
played on the killer's phone.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.831
Isn't that right, Kris?

38:53.866 --> 38:56.200
No.

38:56.234 --> 38:58.235
- Please tell me you didn't.
- Didn't what?

38:58.270 --> 39:01.538
Didn't want to play
her psycho games anymore?

39:01.572 --> 39:03.307
I just wanted out.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.376
But when I told her,
she wouldn't let me quit.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.044
She said that she would destroy me!

39:07.078 --> 39:10.480
That she would destroy us!

39:10.515 --> 39:13.017
So I thought,
why should we take the blame

39:13.051 --> 39:15.719
when she'd already given me
the perfect alibi?

39:15.753 --> 39:18.354
And all you had to do was match
the crime scene to the video,

39:18.389 --> 39:21.558
which is why you transferred
Madison's blood to the ceiling.

39:22.927 --> 39:25.094
She is captain of the cheer squad.

39:25.129 --> 39:28.031
She knows her way
to the top of the pyramid.

39:34.371 --> 39:36.406
So, what's gonna happen to Lucas?

39:36.440 --> 39:38.741
Well, I mean, his only crime was a B&E

39:38.775 --> 39:41.877
in which stolen goods
were stolen and since recovered,

39:41.912 --> 39:43.813
so he'll keep his freedom.

39:43.847 --> 39:46.849
And his scholarship,
although he will be on probation

39:46.883 --> 39:48.751
for the remainder of the term.

39:48.785 --> 39:50.920
Leniency, huh?

39:50.954 --> 39:53.722
Well, nice to see
that the administration

39:53.757 --> 39:55.991
has more compassion now
than they did in my day.

39:56.025 --> 39:57.560
Hmm.

39:57.594 --> 40:00.896
There's one thing
I need to know, Mr. Castle.

40:00.931 --> 40:02.598
It's haunted me for years.

40:02.632 --> 40:04.199
Where did you get the cow?

40:06.535 --> 40:07.869
Put it this way, sir...

40:07.903 --> 40:10.939
if you ever need one, I know a guy.

40:14.177 --> 40:16.979
All right, where do you think
you're going?

40:18.448 --> 40:20.315
They look like they're having fun.

40:20.350 --> 40:22.846
Yeah.

40:22.895 --> 40:26.365
Listen, I know you're a rebel
and you hate convention

40:26.400 --> 40:28.168
and blah, blah, blah, but...

40:28.217 --> 40:31.152
Kate, would you, uh...

40:34.092 --> 40:35.760
will you go to the dance with me?

40:53.015 --> 40:57.150
Do you regret it... that prank,
missing your prom,

40:57.184 --> 40:58.986
not being here with Audra Dobson?

40:59.020 --> 41:01.388
Not even a little bit.

41:01.422 --> 41:06.092
Everything I've ever done,
every choice I've ever made,

41:06.127 --> 41:09.362
every... terrible and wonderful thing

41:09.397 --> 41:11.531
that's ever happened to me...

41:11.565 --> 41:15.535
it's all led me to right here,
this moment, with you.

41:22.343 --> 41:23.704
I've always loved this song.

41:25.579 --> 41:30.516
Could it be we just found our song?

41:30.551 --> 41:31.717
Castle.

41:53.873 --> 41:56.841
- Talk about magnetism.
- Mm.

42:01.814 --> 42:05.050
Oh, that reminds me...

42:05.084 --> 42:06.885
I had UNIs sweep Lucas' house,

42:06.919 --> 42:08.920
and you know what they didn't find?

42:08.955 --> 42:11.890
Wires, magnets,
anything that would explain

42:11.924 --> 42:14.525
that stuff that we saw flying around.

42:19.459 --> 42:21.399
- You don't think...
- No.

42:21.433 --> 42:24.135
Now shut up and kiss me.
