00:02.502 --> 00:03.586
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:03.670 --> 00:05.422
Hello. I'm Sheldon Cooper,
and this is

00:05.505 --> 00:08.090
Why Sheldon Cooper Should Go
to College.

00:08.173 --> 00:10.427
I firmly believe that I'm ready

00:10.510 --> 00:12.470
for this next step
in my academic life.

00:12.554 --> 00:14.764
I guess our baby's
going to college.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.308
So I don't want to get married.
It's nothing personal.

00:17.392 --> 00:20.437
After everything that I've done
for you and your family.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.273
You give my grandson a job
so I'm supposed to marry you?

00:23.356 --> 00:25.608
Well, you can forget
I even asked.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.944
Oh, no.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.279
I screwed up.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.447
You're fired.

00:30.530 --> 00:33.158
Here's for firing
my grandson.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.326
Jackass!

00:39.706 --> 00:41.624
ADULT SHELDON:
I never understood
why kids didn't like

00:41.708 --> 00:42.959
being sent
to the principal's office.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.461
I thought it was great.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.547
Sheldon, you are
a remarkable young man.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.799
Thanks, and you're
a remarkable old man.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.301
Sheldon.

00:51.384 --> 00:52.802
So you sure he's got
all the credits he needs?

00:52.886 --> 00:55.096
Yeah, between his coursework
and his AP tests,

00:55.180 --> 00:57.307
he's met all
of his academic requirements.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.477
He even managed
to get a good grade in P.E.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.645
I earned extra credit
snitching on kids

01:02.729 --> 01:04.647
who were smoking
behind the equipment shed.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.025
I don't have to buy cigarettes
for a year.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.819
So he's really good to graduate?

01:09.903 --> 01:11.488
He sure is.
I got to tell ya,

01:11.571 --> 01:13.156
usually when kids leave school
after two years,

01:13.239 --> 01:14.449
it's not for college.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.535
It's for prison or pregnancy.

01:17.619 --> 01:20.288
Well, between Georgie and Missy,
we may hit the trifecta.

01:20.371 --> 01:21.539
George!

01:21.623 --> 01:22.999
Well, I'm not rooting for it.

01:23.082 --> 01:24.375
It's just a thing
that could happen.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.835
One other bit of business.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.504
Since you're graduating early,

01:27.587 --> 01:29.088
and you're
top of the class,

01:29.172 --> 01:31.674
that makes you
our valedictorian.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.176
Way to go, buddy!

01:33.259 --> 01:35.386
I'm so proud
of you, baby.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.679
You seem surprised.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.057
Well, it's quite
an accomplishment.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.850
Being top of the class
in this school?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.227
I don't think so.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.063
We're really gonna miss you.

01:46.272 --> 01:49.192
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:49.275 --> 01:52.362
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

01:52.445 --> 01:54.739
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

01:54.823 --> 01:56.908
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

01:56.991 --> 02:01.996
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

02:08.127 --> 02:10.672
I imagine my leaving
will be hard for you.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.298
Oh, yeah, being
best friends

02:12.382 --> 02:15.051
with a little kid really
boosted my game with the ladies.

02:15.134 --> 02:18.221
Makes sense.
I'm a conversation starter.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.265
Just think. You'll have
this table all to yourself.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.600
Actually,
I joined the jazz band.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.061
Those guys have their own table
in the cafeteria.

02:25.144 --> 02:27.188
Oh.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.606
They're pretty cool.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.733
The drummer's even got a goatee.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.570
Well, I'm glad I knew you before
you became a heroin addict.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.030
Where are my safety goggles?

02:36.114 --> 02:37.907
I don't have no orange today.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.701
No, I have a lab later.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.411
Just use the room goggles
like everyone else.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.954
And risk eyebrow lice?

02:43.037 --> 02:45.415
They don't just like
head hair, Tam.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.125
They must be in my locker.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.379
Don't eat my fluffernutter!

02:51.462 --> 02:53.464
I won't.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.260
Mmm.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.679
"Don't eat my fluffernutter."

03:07.186 --> 03:08.938
Hello.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.316
Thank you for seeing me.

03:11.399 --> 03:15.361
You might not be so happy I did
by the time we're done.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.285
(sighs)

03:22.368 --> 03:23.828
All right,
let me start by saying

03:23.912 --> 03:25.622
that I owe you an apology.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.082
You can finish
with an apology, too.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.251
I'm sorry we had a fight. I'm...

03:31.336 --> 03:33.004
I'm really sorry
I lost my temper,

03:33.087 --> 03:35.840
and I'm very sorry
that I took it out on Georgie.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.550
That wasn't great.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.930
But I want you to know
that I'm trying to change.

03:42.013 --> 03:45.308
'Cause that's what people do--
they change.

03:45.391 --> 03:49.020
I mean it. You know, I'm tired
of being a cranky old bastard.

03:49.103 --> 03:51.189
It's tiring
for everybody else, too.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.148
Would you please?

03:52.231 --> 03:53.942
Sorry. Go ahead.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.818
(sighs)

03:55.902 --> 03:59.405
I'm admitting I was wrong,
and that's not something I do.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.199
What do you want from me?

04:01.282 --> 04:03.701
One more chance.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.204
I don't know.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.330
Oh, come on.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.333
I went to three stores
to find these purple flowers.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.710
They are pretty.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.837
They're not as pretty as you.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.673
(laughing):
Oh, God.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.384
(laughing)

04:21.970 --> 04:24.973
Safety pins, safety scissors,

04:25.056 --> 04:27.141
no safety goggles.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.562
Did you happen to see
a pair of safety goggles?

04:31.646 --> 04:33.690
Sheldon, we're in
the middle of a test.

04:33.773 --> 04:34.691
Sorry.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.859
I can't give
you the answer,

04:36.943 --> 04:38.695
but what you have
is not even close.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.113
Out!

04:42.907 --> 04:45.034
(sobbing)

04:45.118 --> 04:47.203
These things happen.

04:47.286 --> 04:48.329
(sobbing)

04:48.413 --> 04:49.998
My mother had me
when she was young.

04:50.081 --> 04:53.001
Sorry to interrupt. I can't
find my safety goggles.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.044
Well, they're not here.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.379
I have to find them.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.756
Nothing's more important
than protection!

04:59.966 --> 05:02.176
(sobbing loudly)

05:08.141 --> 05:10.393
Dad, you need to take me home.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.602
Why? What's the matter?

05:11.686 --> 05:13.604
I don't have my safety goggles.
Let's go.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.106
Sheldon, I'm busy.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.399
You're just watching TV.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.400
I'm reviewing game tape.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.736
So you know how it ends.
I'll meet you at the car.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.571
Sheldon, I'm not
driving you home.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.573
I got practice
in 20 minutes.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.408
Then call Mom and tell her
to bring them to me.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.076
She's working, too.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.411
But I need my goggles!

05:28.494 --> 05:30.413
Then use the ones in class.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.248
And I don't want to hear
about eyebrow lice.

05:32.331 --> 05:34.584
The ones in class
are too big for me.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.586
What if they fall off and
something happens to my eyes?

05:36.669 --> 05:38.254
If I go blind,
I'll need a Seeing Eye dog,

05:38.337 --> 05:39.589
and I'm scared of dogs.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.257
Hey!

05:41.340 --> 05:44.677
Is this how you plan on acting
when you get to college?

05:46.387 --> 05:47.430
No.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.765
Good, 'cause you're gonna need

05:48.848 --> 05:50.850
to handle stuff like this
on your own.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.269
I can handle it.

05:53.352 --> 05:54.729
I hope so.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.443
ADULT SHELDON:
I ended up using
the class goggles that day

06:00.526 --> 06:02.820
and did not get eyebrow lice.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.322
But eight months later,

06:04.405 --> 06:06.574
I did contract a mild case
of pink eye.

06:06.657 --> 06:09.911
Were the two events related?
This scientist says yes.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.798
Do you think
I can make it from one end

06:21.881 --> 06:23.591
of the college campus
to the other

06:23.674 --> 06:25.927
in under ten minutes,
including a bathroom break?

06:26.010 --> 06:28.429
I don't know. How important
is the bathroom break?

06:28.513 --> 06:30.765
Very. The class schedules
are designed

06:30.848 --> 06:33.101
for fully-grown bladders,
and mine is child-sized.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.269
Then don't put your classes
so close together.

06:35.353 --> 06:38.815
Well, it's either this or I move
my labs to Tuesday afternoons.

06:38.898 --> 06:39.857
Is that bad?

06:39.941 --> 06:42.026
Yes. That's when
Professor Proton is on.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.655
Well, we'll tape it,
and you can watch it later.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.406
But what if I have a lot
of homework and can't get to it

06:47.490 --> 06:48.825
until the next day
and one of the kids

06:48.908 --> 06:50.993
in my class
spoils the episode for me?

06:51.077 --> 06:54.455
Sheldon, has anyone ever spoiled
Professor Proton for you?

06:54.539 --> 06:57.875
No.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.875
Has anyone even talked to you
about Professor Proton?

06:57.959 --> 07:00.002
Do you count?

06:57.959 --> 07:00.002
No.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.712
Then no.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.343
Thanks again for
giving me another shot.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.303
Oh, my pleasure.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.180
And I got
something else for you.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.890
(drawer opens)

07:17.186 --> 07:19.063
(drawer closes)

07:19.147 --> 07:22.316
Wow. Thank you, but why?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.653
Well, I'm trying to get better
at forgiving people.

07:25.736 --> 07:27.697
Well, I'm glad
to hear you say that,

07:27.780 --> 07:30.158
'cause I'm the one
who egged your store last night.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.660
That was you?

07:32.743 --> 07:34.996
Well, me and Meemaw.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.582
Oh.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.375
It's okay.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.043
I forgive you.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.087
Cool.
Thanks again for the money.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.926
Mm, forgiving people sucks.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.847
Bless us, Lord, for the food
we are about to receive,

07:52.930 --> 07:54.182
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.057
And thank you

07:55.141 --> 07:57.560
for Georgie getting
his job back. Amen.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.936
ALL:
Amen.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.354
That was nice of Dale.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.899
I know. He even forgave me
for egging his store.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.317
You went egging
without me?

08:04.400 --> 08:05.234
Georgie Cooper!

08:05.318 --> 08:07.612
Dale already forgave me,
and God has to.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.238
You can't get mad.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.532
Ha. Burn.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.869
Oh. Hold on.
Hold on.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.704
Your chair, milady.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.915
"Milady"?

08:18.998 --> 08:20.374
Where did that come from?

08:20.458 --> 08:21.709
I don't know.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.545
My brain.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.545
(laughs)

08:24.629 --> 08:26.631
Can I get y'all started
with some drinks?

08:26.714 --> 08:28.090
Yeah. Uh, margaritas?

08:28.174 --> 08:29.884
Mm-hmm.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.884
Split a pitcher?

08:29.967 --> 08:31.636
Mm, no, I think I'm okay.

08:31.719 --> 08:32.970
More of a beer night?

08:33.054 --> 08:34.222
No, not really.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.556
I'm gonna take a little break.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.974
I'll just stick with water.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.268
Really?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.437
Well, you know,
I don't do my best thinking

08:41.520 --> 08:43.606
after I've been drinking.
(laughs)

08:43.688 --> 08:45.066
(chuckles)

08:45.149 --> 08:46.609
Should I not get one, then?

08:46.692 --> 08:47.568
No, no, you go ahead.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.819
I don't want it to get weird.

08:48.903 --> 08:49.695
I can come back.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.781
No, no. Hey, just
bring her a margarita.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.908
No, don't.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.908
I insist.

08:53.991 --> 08:54.951
I don't want one.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.244
Yeah, you do.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.620
It's getting weird.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.872
Maybe come back.

09:00.748 --> 09:05.503
Missy, how would you and Sheldon
like a graduation party?

09:05.586 --> 09:07.505
Why would Missy have
a graduation party?

09:07.588 --> 09:09.590
'Cause I'm graduating
elementary school.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.635
That counts?

09:09.674 --> 09:12.635
Of course it counts.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.263
Yes, it's a big deal.
She's going to a new school.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.181
New friends, new teachers.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.975
Same clothes
'cause we're poor.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.018
(phone ringing)

09:19.058 --> 09:21.018
We're not poor.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.311
So I can get new clothes?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.021
We're not rich,
either.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.773
Do I really got to sit
through two graduations?

09:25.856 --> 09:29.110
Yes. It is a special day for
your brother and your sister.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.112
I'm giving the
valedictorian speech.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.863
And I'm singing
"This Land Is Your Land"

09:32.947 --> 09:34.282
with a bunch of other kids.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.576
And we are proud
of you both equally.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.453
Guess what.
The local news wants

09:39.537 --> 09:41.372
to do story on Sheldon
being valedictorian.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.332
(chuckles)
Isn't that great?

09:45.084 --> 09:46.627
What?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.713
Cheers.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.050
How is it?

09:53.134 --> 09:54.885
Good. Yours?

09:54.969 --> 09:57.013
A little watery.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.182
I want to tell you
how much I appreciate you

10:00.266 --> 10:01.642
giving Georgie his job back.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.020
Well, I didn't
do it just for you.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.188
It was
the right thing to do.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.816
I even forgave him
for egging the store.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.651
(gasps)
He egged your store?

10:10.735 --> 10:12.486
That rascal!

10:12.570 --> 10:13.863
I know you did it, too.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.865
Okay, I did.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.746
You go to church,
don't you?

10:23.998 --> 10:25.708
Yeah, when I'm not hungover.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.377
Well, maybe I'll go
with you sometime.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.546
Really? You?

10:30.629 --> 10:34.050
Yeah, I was thinking a little
religion might do me some good.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.761
Well, good for you. (chuckles)

10:36.844 --> 10:40.014
I was thinking
it was a fajita night.

10:40.097 --> 10:43.392
Your daughter runs
a Bible study, doesn't she?

10:44.977 --> 10:46.896
Uh-huh.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.565
ADULT SHELDON:
The next day, the local news
showed up to interview me

10:49.649 --> 10:52.360
and my family,
which may sound impressive,

10:52.443 --> 10:55.571
but this is the same local news
that covered a potato chip

10:55.654 --> 10:56.906
shaped like Texas.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.033
So act natural.
We're just having a chat.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.576
I'm gonna ask y'all
a few questions

11:00.659 --> 11:02.328
about Sheldon's
high school graduation.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.705
I'm graduating, also.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.416
Really? You're graduating
from high school, too?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.251
No, elementary school.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.252
Oh.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.922
My class is singing
"This Land Is Your Land."

11:13.005 --> 11:14.215
Want to hear it?

11:14.298 --> 11:16.217
♪ This land is your land... ♪

11:16.300 --> 11:18.594
Hey, can I ask my girlfriend
to the prom on TV?

11:18.677 --> 11:20.262
It would blow her mind.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.431
♪ To the New York Islands,
from the... ♪

11:22.515 --> 11:24.725
We're here
with the Cooper family.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.478
Mary, George
and 11-year-old Sheldon,

11:27.561 --> 11:30.398
who's going to be Medford
High School's valedictorian.

11:30.481 --> 11:33.609
Mom and Dad,
you must be so proud.

11:33.692 --> 11:34.944
Oh, very proud.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.570
But we're proud
of all of our children.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.407
She has to say that.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.200
I was a little worried
about missing

11:41.283 --> 11:42.785
Professor Proton,
but I'm going to tape it

11:42.868 --> 11:44.120
and watch it at night.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.413
Once I'm in college,

11:45.496 --> 11:47.415
can we push my bedtime to 8:30?

11:47.498 --> 11:49.750
Let's talk bedtime when
we're not on the news, honey.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.919
I'm sure it'll work out
since I have all summer

11:52.002 --> 11:53.796
to recalibrate
my bathroom schedule.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.005
Let's not talk
about that, either.

11:55.089 --> 11:59.301
So what's it like being the
parents of such a special child?

11:59.385 --> 12:00.761
Get it away! Get it away!

12:00.845 --> 12:02.179
Fascinating.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.476
(chicken clucking,
Sheldon screaming)

12:07.560 --> 12:09.270
Every day's a blessing.

12:09.353 --> 12:10.813
Sheldon, tell us
what you're gonna miss

12:10.896 --> 12:12.481
the most about high school.

12:13.607 --> 12:14.817
Nothing.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.318
Really?

12:16.402 --> 12:18.195
Not your teachers, your friends?

12:18.279 --> 12:19.947
I only have one friend.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.532
And I don't think
he's gonna miss me because

12:21.615 --> 12:24.160
he already found other people
to have lunch with.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.244
Oh, I'm sure
he'll miss you.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.788
And I said I'm okay with
watching Professor Proton

12:27.872 --> 12:28.998
at night,
but that'll never work.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.125
I get overtired--
everybody knows that!

12:31.208 --> 12:32.251
Maybe we could turn
the camera off.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.252
And the other day, I couldn't
find my safety goggles

12:33.335 --> 12:35.880
and I freaked out in school,
and my dad asked

12:35.963 --> 12:38.299
is this how I plan on acting
when I get to college,

12:38.382 --> 12:39.425
and I said no,
but it probably is

12:39.508 --> 12:41.844
because even though I'm smart,
I'm just a little boy!

12:42.761 --> 12:44.597
I think we have enough.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.597
Cut.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.856
Here you go, baby.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.818
I don't know if I can go
to college next year.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.069
Are you kidding me?!

12:59.153 --> 13:00.362
George.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.656
Buddy, I know you're upset.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.992
But are you kidding me?

13:05.075 --> 13:06.702
Don't listen to him.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.329
There is no pressure.

13:08.412 --> 13:11.165
If you want to spend
another year in high school,

13:11.248 --> 13:12.750
that is your decision.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.877
I don't know.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.755
May I be excused?

13:17.838 --> 13:19.715
Uh, of course.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.431
We support you, buddy!

13:34.605 --> 13:36.190
I get it.

13:36.273 --> 13:38.359
What do you get?

13:38.442 --> 13:40.277
Why you don't want to go
to college.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.738
I doubt that you do.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.575
You're scared everything's
gonna be different

13:46.659 --> 13:48.661
and it'll be hard.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.623
And you're gonna miss
the way that it was.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.876
How do you know that?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.629
'Cause that's how I feel.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.883
You're scared?

14:05.177 --> 14:06.387
Yeah.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.514
So what do we do?

14:11.642 --> 14:14.436
I guess be scared
and do it anyway.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.981
Hmm.

14:19.066 --> 14:22.236
It's comforting to know that
you feel the same way that I do.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.822
That's why I said it, dumbass.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.158
(sighs)

14:29.827 --> 14:31.745
Mom?

14:31.829 --> 14:33.122
Dad?

14:33.205 --> 14:35.249
MARY:
Yeah, baby?

14:37.835 --> 14:39.962
I'm ready to graduate.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.839
Good night.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.301
(door closes)

14:45.384 --> 14:48.137
That's because I supported him.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.805
(page turns)

14:49.888 --> 14:51.557
(sighs)

14:51.640 --> 14:52.975
(applause)

14:53.058 --> 14:54.810
PETERSEN:
Our next young speaker needs

14:54.893 --> 14:56.478
no introduction,
but that didn't stop him

14:56.562 --> 14:59.481
from writing one
and making me read it.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.358
(laughter)

15:01.442 --> 15:02.776
"Fun fact."

15:02.860 --> 15:04.111
(audience groaning, murmuring)

15:04.194 --> 15:06.280
I hear you.

15:06.363 --> 15:09.700
"The word 'valedictorian' is
from the Latin 'valedicere,'

15:09.783 --> 15:13.287
"meaning 'to say farewell.'

15:13.370 --> 15:15.497
"It is primarily used
in the United States,

15:15.581 --> 15:18.125
Canada, the Philippines
and Armenia."

15:18.208 --> 15:21.295
Maybe that fact's more fun
in Armenia.

15:21.378 --> 15:26.842
Please welcome your
valedictorian, Sheldon Cooper.

15:26.925 --> 15:29.053
Yay, Shelly!

15:32.056 --> 15:33.599
Hello.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.312
I'm not very comfortable
speaking in front of crowds.

15:38.395 --> 15:41.231
But there's a technique
to reduce stage fright

15:41.315 --> 15:43.817
by focusing on
one person in the audience

15:43.901 --> 15:46.236
and delivering your speech
just to them.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.324
That's what I'll be doing today.

15:52.576 --> 15:55.496
If it weren't for this person,
I wouldn't be here right now.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.706
They've taught me a lot,

15:57.790 --> 16:00.167
and it's by their example
that I found the courage

16:00.250 --> 16:03.921
to move forward into this new
and exciting chapter of my life.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.549
Missy...

16:09.134 --> 16:11.387
...this is for you.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.182
Change can be scary,

16:15.265 --> 16:18.560
but I know
we're going to be fine...

16:20.354 --> 16:22.272
...because like you said,

16:22.356 --> 16:24.566
"It's okay to be scared.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.276
We just have to do it anyway."

16:29.279 --> 16:33.575
So if any of my fellow graduates
are nervous about the future,

16:33.659 --> 16:36.245
know that you're not alone.

16:37.162 --> 16:40.416
I suggest you all try to be
as brave as my twin sister.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.418
That's my plan.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.086
Missy,

16:44.169 --> 16:46.755
I wish I could give you advice
about middle school,

16:46.839 --> 16:49.591
but I was so smart,
I skipped it.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.719
If you make it to high school,
we'll talk.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.595
Thank you.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.723

ADULT SHELDON:
The following day,

17:06.023 --> 17:08.944
I attended my sister's
elementary school graduation.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.738
She didn't deliver
a speech to me,

17:10.820 --> 17:12.239
but she did make eye contact

17:12.321 --> 17:14.241
while she sang

17:24.960 --> 17:26.753
ADULT SHELDON:
Later that day, we had

17:26.837 --> 17:29.089
a graduation party
for me and my sister.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.424
I don't normally care
for parties,

17:30.507 --> 17:31.967
but this one wasn't so bad.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.177
Who's ready for cake?

17:33.260 --> 17:34.428
Me!

17:34.511 --> 17:37.306
Hey, should we say grace?

17:37.389 --> 17:39.767
Heck, yeah! Let's hold hands.

17:39.850 --> 17:43.103
Oh, cool. Let's say grace.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.147
ADULT SHELDON:
Dale invited Jesus to the party,

17:45.230 --> 17:49.151
and while he wasn't
on my guest list, it was okay

17:49.234 --> 17:50.611
because it made my mom happy.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.654
And bless our
friends and family...

17:52.738 --> 17:54.990
ADULT SHELDON:
In fact, it was
the best graduation party

17:55.073 --> 17:56.950
I had ever been to,

17:57.034 --> 18:01.121
until the one we had
for my son, Leonard Cooper.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.332
ALL:
Amen.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.332
Cake!

18:03.415 --> 18:05.626
ADULT SHELDON:
I wanted his name to be

18:05.709 --> 18:09.004
Leonard "Nimoy" Cooper,
but Amy wouldn't let me.

18:09.087 --> 18:11.006
AMY:
Be happy I let you
name him Leonard!

18:11.089 --> 18:12.883
ADULT SHELDON:
Okay, okay!

18:12.966 --> 18:14.927
AMY: Love you.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.927
ADULT SHELDON: Love you, too.
