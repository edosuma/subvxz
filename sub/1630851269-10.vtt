[birds twitter]

00:55.056 --> 00:57.122
The name kalahari

00:57.291 --> 01:00.826
Is derived from the
nasetswa word kh-arla,

01:01.028 --> 01:04.029
Meaning 'the great thirst'.

The desert springs into life
once more.

01:45.439 --> 01:48.340
The green shoots of recovery
bring relief

01:48.542 --> 01:51.276
After the hardship
teof winr.

01:54.715 --> 02:00.152
And lonely wanderers seek a
return to the comforhots of me.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.978
In hakuna matata territory,

02:28.315 --> 02:32.250
Spring is definitely in the air.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.155
Greebo, one of flint's seven
week old pups,

02:37.191 --> 02:39.057
Is captivated.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.209
The neighbours,
a pair of ground squirrels,

02:57.411 --> 02:59.811
Are putting on quite a show.

03:05.319 --> 03:08.987
No-oe ne elsis at all interested
in their antics.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.890
They'd rather
acquaint themselves

03:12.059 --> 03:14.660
With their lush
new surroundings.

03:16.730 --> 03:21.099
Flint has picked a prime spot,
replenished by tnshe rai.

03:23.037 --> 03:27.539

04:02.643 --> 04:05.377
The extroverts
are soon forgotten,

04:06.814 --> 04:10.649
When a new arrival
diverts everyoneen's atttion.

04:14.021 --> 04:17.155
It's the pups' older brother
gurke -

04:19.493 --> 04:24.696
Last seen inam a stey embrace
with wren of the ubuntu clan.

04:28.002 --> 04:32.571
He's welcomed back with a good
dousing of hakuna matata scent.

04:37.911 --> 04:42.847
It's all a bit overwhelming
for young havelock...

04:43.150 --> 04:47.986
Who is moved to safety by his
unnew-fod big brother gurke.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.458

Elsewhere, ubuntu leader daisy

05:24.391 --> 05:27.392
Has her broodi
ng eyeon the horizon.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.498
She has recently
moved the family

05:33.667 --> 05:35.834
Back into the heart
of her territory

05:36.103 --> 05:40.906
And settled in a remote spot
near the u dsuallyry river bed.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.783
W that she's over half way
through her pregnancy,

05:52.019 --> 05:56.655
The biggest threat she faces
is not from rovers...

05:58.292 --> 06:01.159
...But from her closest kin.

06:05.532 --> 06:09.066
Ricky, wren and the native
are all absent,

06:09.269 --> 06:12.971
Enjoheying t charms
of roving males.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.245
But desert flings
tend to be short-lived...

06:20.514 --> 06:24.583
So there's a good chhaance tt at
least one of them will return.

06:27.755 --> 06:31.356
But they may not get
a warm welcome.

06:33.227 --> 06:36.060
Any of them coulomd be cing home
pregnant -

06:36.363 --> 06:41.032
Which would pose a deadly threat
to daisy's newborns.

06:44.037 --> 06:48.707
Should the girls show up,
daisy will be ready for them.

06:57.517 --> 06:58.984
In whiskers territory,

07:00.854 --> 07:03.054
The manor's
oldest serving mchatriar

07:03.357 --> 07:06.992
Is facing a prob  lem
she hasn't had in a while.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.196
A childcare crisis.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.200
And it's of her own making.

07:17.137 --> 07:22.307
Overnight, swift gave birth
er to h 15th litter.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.510
W the nepups
are safely underground,

07:25.679 --> 07:27.678
But foner the xt 48 hours

07:27.915 --> 07:29.781
They're at their most
vulnerable...

07:32.119 --> 07:35.887
Th...So ey need
experienced babysitters.

07:36.156 --> 07:41.626
The problem is, swift has kicked
out her most capable nannies,

07:41.962 --> 07:45.831
Os
the that are left are barely
out of daycare themselves...

07:48.469 --> 07:50.469
[playful growls]

08:01.415 --> 08:04.483
...Which means there's anfu
awl lot more mucking around

08:04.718 --> 08:06.918
Than there is mucking in.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.859
Swift does her best
to keep a lid on things but,

08:15.162 --> 08:20.065
The workload for her
and partner brreea is lentless.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.344
With all these extra demands
on her,

08:32.546 --> 08:36.581
Swift sensibly chooses
to forage close to home.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.356
At the burrow, ha-chee and fly

08:44.725 --> 08:47.291
Are doing a commenjodable b
at underground security -

08:47.561 --> 08:50.996
But they'role not d enough
to wet nur pse theups.

08:55.002 --> 08:58.837
So swift has to keep returning
to feed them.

09:02.843 --> 09:06.577
The change in family dynamics
xh  is eausting for the new mum

09:06.880 --> 09:10.282
Whose responsibilities were
demanding enough before this.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.519
If the whiskers are to thrive,

09:15.789 --> 09:20.158
Swifunt's yogsters are
going to have to grow up fast.

09:32.039 --> 09:35.407
In a far-flung corner
of the manor,

09:35.709 --> 09:39.344
Me
soone is sporting
a new radio tracker.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.481
It's belphegor!

09:43.750 --> 09:46.083
The hakuna matata rover
was last seen

09:46.353 --> 09:51.423
Playing goosebury to gurke,
and his ubuntu lover, wren.

09:51.758 --> 09:56.360
But ther se's noign of wren,
or her cousin ricky now.

09:56.630 --> 10:00.899
Ticks indicate nobody hasoo
grmed him for a while.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.637
With gurke already home,

10:05.839 --> 10:08.172
It seems the once-promising
foursome

10:08.375 --> 10:11.142
Is now down to a lonesome one.

10:14.081 --> 10:19.217
His head bobbing shows
that he feels under threat.

10:31.698 --> 10:35.934
The dishevelled isrover  also
sporting a slight limp...

10:38.905 --> 10:40.805
A clash with gerurke phaps?

10:41.108 --> 10:44.909
Or another rival male
who whisked the ladies away.

10:48.582 --> 10:49.681
It's a set-back,

10:49.916 --> 10:53.051
A
but seasoned rover
simply brushes himself down

10:53.253 --> 10:55.186
D
anstarts again.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.625
The most successful
can secure themselves

11:00.961 --> 11:06.097
The top job of dominant male
by starting a new family.

11:06.299 --> 11:10.101
But belphegor is far from
being a roving legend.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.640
Down on his luck, it looks like
this pitiful traveller

11:15.909 --> 11:19.611
May also be
on a long journey home.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.486
Belphegor isn't the only one

11:28.755 --> 11:32.290
Facing an inglorious return
to family.

11:33.593 --> 11:36.794
After being jiltbyed
desert player lewie,

11:37.064 --> 11:40.065
The native is scratching out
a lonely meal

11:40.300 --> 11:42.701
Close to the ubuntu burrow.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.638
Ants are hardly fine dining

11:46.840 --> 11:49.174
But surface bugs
are the safest option

11:49.443 --> 11:51.743
When no-ontce's wahiyong
ur back.

11:55.015 --> 11:58.283
She's facing the unenviable -
yet all too familiar -

11:58.552 --> 12:02.320
At  situion of
single desert female :

12:04.725 --> 12:08.025
Unadopted by a rover,
unacceptable to other families,

12:08.361 --> 12:13.698
And therefore fated with a short
life expectancy unless...

12:14.868 --> 12:17.802
...She can make amends with mum.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.940
Good luck with that!

12:25.378 --> 12:29.480
The native may be within
spitting distance  fof heramily

12:29.750 --> 12:33.985
But she couldn't be fu
rther away from a welcbrome ema.

12:44.196 --> 12:49.601
After travelling all morning,
belpsthegor ops for a snack.

12:52.205 --> 12:55.240
He's finally reached
a familiar landmark.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.412
Flint's favoured roadside diner,

13:01.581 --> 13:04.716
On the border unof haka matata
territory.

13:11.691 --> 13:16.494
He now has a good chance of
g pickinup the family scent...

13:16.763 --> 13:19.631
...As long as the rain
hasn't washed it away.

13:29.843 --> 13:32.844
Buimt a glpse of someone
in the distance

13:33.079 --> 13:35.113
Stops him in his tracks.

13:41.321 --> 13:45.190
Whoever it is
doesn't look like family...

13:46.426 --> 13:48.626
He needs to get closer...

13:50.330 --> 13:54.365
Maybe  nit's aew evictee
to try his luck with.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.075
But this is no female.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.112
It's none other than - pixie

14:08.248 --> 14:10.215
E
thzulu chancer last seen

14:10.550 --> 14:14.185
Making a play for daisy's girls
with his brother jay.

14:28.268 --> 14:32.770
Belphegor seems surprisingly
pleased to meet him.

14:47.888 --> 14:48.786
The boys are both in need

14:49.089 --> 14:51.055
Of gentle grooming
and companionship

14:51.358 --> 14:55.260
And it's nobody's business
but .Theirs

15:08.909 --> 15:11.275
Still close to their burrow,

15:11.444 --> 15:12.911

15:13.213 --> 15:15.747
Of the bounty the rains
have provid.De

15:26.726 --> 15:30.161
While everybody else tucks in -
is elderly brea.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.033
He's taken over lilac's duties

15:36.269 --> 15:39.704
As there's still no sign
of the rover's return.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.247
It's quite a strain
for the old boy.

15:49.549 --> 15:53.151
His heart is willing,
buirt he tes fast.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.888
And there are bolt holes
that need scrkent maing

15:58.024 --> 15:59.924
Cl  and earing too.

S  showa willingness to step up.

16:30.523 --> 16:35.159
This is loo-pin's moment
to help protect his family.

16:42.002 --> 16:46.204
As for the others, play figh   g
is the main pre-occupation.

At almost a year oldsi,

17:02.088 --> 17:07.125
But soon they too wirall attct
the attention of rovers...

17:08.928 --> 17:12.797
And theiltr loyay to their
mother will be tested.

17:15.235 --> 17:18.970
But for now,
swift can sleep easy.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.482
As dscusk deends,

17:31.818 --> 17:36.421
The native is still lurking at
the edthge of e ubuntu burrow.

17:37.824 --> 17:42.160
Given daisy's unforgiving mood,
s   she'either brave...

17:43.063 --> 17:44.695
...Or desperate.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.499
Oblivious to her presence,

17:48.802 --> 17:51.536
The rest of the family
is preparing for bed.

17:57.043 --> 18:00.411
Coming in closer
is a risky move...

18:06.953 --> 18:11.556
It turns o iut shes embarking
on an audacious strategy...

18:15.361 --> 18:18.629
... Following the others down
for the night.

18:21.668 --> 18:25.803
As long as she still has her
distinctive ubunnttu sce...

18:27.073 --> 18:29.940
She should be hidden
in the maze of t,unnels

18:30.110 --> 18:33.077
Right under her mother's nose.

18:44.958 --> 18:49.893
The native is first up; waiting
nervously as, one by one,

18:50.063 --> 18:52.630
The rest of the family surfaces.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.839
Now, shoulder to shoulder
with her siblings

19:02.142 --> 19:06.110
She is r hiskinger life
for reconciliation.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.055
They're not exactly
rolling out the red carpet

19:18.224 --> 19:21.259
T they seem
to be tolerating her.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.331
But what about the boss?

19:31.070 --> 19:33.070
[frantic growls]

19:33.406 --> 19:37.041
Pregnant or not,
there's no holding daisy back.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.282
The native must go -
once and for all.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.762
Yet again, a femfaale's te

19:58.064 --> 20:01.632
Is sealed by her heavily
pregnant matriarch.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.980
Things are getting off
to a more sedate start

20:16.115 --> 20:18.849
In hakuna matata territory,

20:19.185 --> 20:23.521
Where belphegor and pixie's
bromance is blossoming.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.958
Ey
th take some time to bathe
together in thine morng sun...

20:28.394 --> 20:30.995
Before setting off for brunch.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.468
Whether they know it or not,

20:37.804 --> 20:42.573
They are leisurely strolling
towards flint's rrnew buow

20:45.645 --> 20:48.145
Where the hakuna matarata
e also enjoying

20:48.314 --> 20:51.148
A relaxed start to the day...

20:53.753 --> 20:58.422
Until ogg and greebo
discover a deae.D snak..

21:00.360 --> 21:03.461
Ich ogg has
no intention of sharing.

21:06.199 --> 21:09.066
Not  even
with his big brother gurke.

21:10.003 --> 21:12.136
[growls]

21:20.913 --> 21:22.579
With all this providing
a distraction,

21:22.882 --> 21:25.582
Nobody notices
pixie and belphegor's arrival

21:25.718 --> 21:27.785
50 a yardsway.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.227
But belphegor has spotted them.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.163
His family!

21:46.072 --> 21:48.538
Surely this
scene  of domestic bliss

21:48.775 --> 21:52.510
Is the perfect opportunity
for a happy reunion?

21:59.118 --> 22:02.320
But belphegor seems hesitant.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.233
