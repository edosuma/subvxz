00:30.030 --> 00:32.423
<i>My name is Sebastian.
And, yeah, that's me.</i>

00:32.423 --> 00:35.209
<i>When my mother used
to dress me for pre-school,</i>

00:35.209 --> 00:38.386
<i>like I was going to Studio 54.</i>

00:38.386 --> 00:42.433
<i>Like most American stories,
mine starts a long time ago</i>

00:42.433 --> 00:43.652
<i>on another continent.</i>

00:44.870 --> 00:49.092
<i>Specifically,
the magical island of Sicilia.</i>

00:50.963 --> 00:52.443
<i>A lot of folks
like to call Sicily</i>

00:52.443 --> 00:54.880
<i>the big ball in front
of the boot of Italy,</i>

00:54.880 --> 00:56.317
<i>which makes sense</i>

00:56.317 --> 00:57.883
<i>'cause the world's been
trying to kick our ass</i>

00:57.883 --> 00:59.972
<i>since the dawn of time.</i>

01:01.409 --> 01:03.367
<i>For generations,
my people have been</i>

01:03.367 --> 01:05.543
<i>threatened by wars,</i>

01:05.543 --> 01:07.067
<i>volcanoes,</i>

01:07.067 --> 01:10.070
<i>and testicle-crushing Speedos.</i>

01:11.158 --> 01:12.768
<i>But we survived it all</i>

01:12.768 --> 01:15.336
<i>through one unstoppable force.</i>

01:15.858 --> 01:17.468
<i>Family.</i>

01:17.468 --> 01:22.256
<i>These are actual photos
of my Sicilian ancestors.</i>

01:22.256 --> 01:25.215
<i>Note the signature
Maniscalco look.</i>

01:25.215 --> 01:29.306
<i>With the curved spines
and the resting bitch face,</i>

01:29.306 --> 01:32.701
<i>like a bunch
of pissed-off candy canes.</i>

01:32.701 --> 01:35.138
<i>Over the past few centuries,</i>

01:35.138 --> 01:40.143
<i>these proud hunchback men
have operated with one goal.</i>

01:40.143 --> 01:41.449
<i>Do everything you can...</i>

01:41.449 --> 01:43.190
<i>...to give your kids
a better life</i>

01:43.190 --> 01:45.061
<i>than the one you had.</i>

01:45.061 --> 01:47.150
<i>For my father,
this meant leaving</i>

01:47.150 --> 01:49.674
<i>his beloved Sicily
for Chicago.</i>

01:49.674 --> 01:52.024
<i>So he and my mother could
give me opportunities</i>

01:52.024 --> 01:53.113
<i>they never got.</i>

01:53.113 --> 01:55.463
<i>Like shoveling snow.</i>

01:55.463 --> 01:58.727
<i>Growing a beautiful mullet.</i>

01:58.727 --> 02:00.207
<i>And going to the prom</i>

02:00.207 --> 02:01.730
<i>looking like a pit boss.</i>

02:03.297 --> 02:05.212
<i>Growing up,
my father busted his hump</i>

02:05.212 --> 02:07.214
<i>to instill in me certain rules</i>

02:07.214 --> 02:09.868
<i>of how a man should operate.</i>

02:09.868 --> 02:13.220
<i>Like, if you're awake,
you should be workin'.</i>

02:13.220 --> 02:14.743
Hey, how's
the pressure,
Mrs. Marinelli?

02:14.743 --> 02:16.440
Harder.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.963
You got to get in there, son.
I don't pay you by the hour,

02:17.963 --> 02:19.487
I pay you
by the moan, capisce?

02:22.011 --> 02:23.491
<i>Guy
with the ponytail,</i>

02:23.491 --> 02:24.927
<i>that's my dad.</i>

02:24.927 --> 02:27.364
<i>Did I mention he owns a salon?</i>

02:27.364 --> 02:30.846
<i>The man comes from a long line
of Sicilian hairstylists.</i>

02:30.846 --> 02:33.022
<i>And don't you dare
call him a barber.</i>

02:33.022 --> 02:35.329
<i>This man doesn't
just cut hair,</i>

02:35.329 --> 02:37.505
<i>he creates styles.</i>

02:37.505 --> 02:39.507
Salvo,

02:39.507 --> 02:40.899
it's beautiful.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.901
See? I told you
you had cheekbones
under there.

02:42.901 --> 02:45.426
You just needed Michelangelo
to dig them out.

02:45.426 --> 02:48.124
<i>Child labor laws
were definitely broken.</i>

02:48.124 --> 02:49.430
<i>But on the bright side,</i>

02:49.430 --> 02:52.172
<i>I had the most realistic
Chewbacca costume</i>

02:52.172 --> 02:53.999
<i>in the history of Halloween.</i>

02:56.350 --> 02:58.917
<i>He taught me
to always save your money.</i>

02:58.917 --> 03:00.484
No apps, no dessert.

03:00.484 --> 03:01.833
And if you don't
finish your main,

03:01.833 --> 03:03.618
you're paying
for your own
birthday dinner.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.450
<i>And to be resourceful.</i>

03:09.450 --> 03:10.886
You wanted me
to buy you
a skateboard,

03:10.886 --> 03:12.279
I built you
one instead.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.107
Next year,
I'm gonna
build you

03:15.107 --> 03:17.197
one of those Nintendos.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.329
<i>But one exception, cologne.</i>

03:19.329 --> 03:23.377
<i>Never cheap out
on your signature scent.</i>

03:23.377 --> 03:26.902
<i>At bedtime, our house smelled
like an Uber in Las Vegas.</i>

03:30.253 --> 03:32.734
<i>The only time I saw
my father smile is</i>

03:32.734 --> 03:33.996
<i>when we did
the chicken dance</i>

03:33.996 --> 03:35.084
<i>for my mother.</i>

03:37.565 --> 03:40.002
<i>To me, this man was a God.</i>

03:41.482 --> 03:43.701
<i>And it was all
working out great</i>

03:43.701 --> 03:45.573
<i>until I grew up,</i>

03:45.573 --> 03:49.707
<i>and fell for someone
who was my complete opposite.</i>

03:49.707 --> 03:52.232
<i>Her name was Ellie.</i>

03:53.189 --> 03:55.539
<i>I mean, look at this girl.</i>

03:55.539 --> 03:59.717
<i>The style, the positivity,</i>

03:59.717 --> 04:01.850
<i>personality.</i>

04:01.850 --> 04:04.722
<i>Yeah, this was my dream woman.</i>

04:08.117 --> 04:09.249
Sebastian!

04:10.772 --> 04:12.904
Ah! I'm so sorry
I'm late.

04:12.904 --> 04:15.342
This guy's charging
$15 for valet.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.126
So I parked it
nine blocks away.

04:17.126 --> 04:19.041
Wait a minute,
if you parked
that far away,

04:19.041 --> 04:21.043
how are you so dry?
You sweat just
getting the mail.

04:21.043 --> 04:23.219
It's the Fendi, babe.

04:23.219 --> 04:25.352
It's wicking away.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.050
- You want one?
- Yeah.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.486
You know,
everyone said
I should serve

04:29.486 --> 04:31.749
fancy food
at my opening,
and I was like,

04:31.749 --> 04:36.537
"Name one person
that doesn't like
a hot dog."

04:36.537 --> 04:39.279
<i>And get this, she's an artist.</i>

04:39.279 --> 04:41.019
<i>I mean, growing up,
I wasn't even allowed</i>

04:41.019 --> 04:42.543
<i>to do it as a hobby.</i>

04:42.543 --> 04:43.631
So how's
the show going?

04:43.631 --> 04:46.068
Oh, my God!
Freaking amazing.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.113
All my pieces sold out
in like 15 minutes.

04:48.113 --> 04:50.594
- Babe, that's incredible.
- I know, right?

04:50.594 --> 04:52.988
I mean, most of them went
to this big decorator,

04:52.988 --> 04:56.296
but they have clients
all over the world,
so I'm not complaining.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.906
Well, you shouldn't.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.734
Especially because they look,
kind of like, you know...

05:00.865 --> 05:02.432
Vaginas?

05:02.432 --> 05:05.566
Well, you know,
if you just hang
them horizontally,

05:08.046 --> 05:09.657
they kind of look
like sunsets.

05:09.657 --> 05:11.049
Oh, yeah.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.312
Right.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.661
<i>Since the day I met her,</i>

05:13.661 --> 05:15.315
<i>she's been opening my eyes</i>

05:15.315 --> 05:18.100
<i>to all kinds
of new experiences.</i>

05:18.100 --> 05:19.493
<i>Like naps.</i>

05:19.493 --> 05:21.408
Weird.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.758
The sun's coming
through the drapes.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.412
<i>And beauty treatments.</i>

05:25.412 --> 05:27.762
Hey, hot stuff.
Looking good.

05:27.762 --> 05:28.850
Wait, are you mad?

05:28.850 --> 05:30.330
Yeah.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.897
That it took 42 years
to discover avocado masks.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.856
<i>And last but not least,</i>

05:34.856 --> 05:35.900
<i>smiling.</i>

05:37.685 --> 05:39.643
Okay. Um...

05:39.643 --> 05:41.384
- It's not natural.
- That's...

05:41.384 --> 05:44.387
That's not
particularly natural.
But you know what I think?

05:44.387 --> 05:47.129
I think we just
have to build these
facial muscles,

05:47.129 --> 05:48.652
so you just
got to practice.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.698
Look at that.
Now try it.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.395
I don't... You
look great.

05:55.485 --> 05:58.706
<i>Yeah, life
with Ellie was pretty perfect.</i>

06:01.926 --> 06:03.275
I don't think
I could participate.

06:03.275 --> 06:04.451
That's just ridiculous.

06:04.451 --> 06:05.930
- You promised.
- Oh, come on!

06:05.930 --> 06:08.759
A public wedding
proposal? It's
embarrassing.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.326
I think
it's sweet.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.110
When I propose
to you,

06:12.110 --> 06:13.547
it's going
to be intimate.

06:13.547 --> 06:15.113
- Hmm.
- Just you and me,

06:15.113 --> 06:16.463
the way
it should be.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.116
- Hmm.
- No one else.

06:18.116 --> 06:19.988
Used to be,
"If I propose."

06:19.988 --> 06:21.816
You just said,
"When I propose."

06:21.816 --> 06:23.731
Okay, babe,
it's just...
I'm aggravated.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.820
Words are just
flying out
of my mouth.

06:25.820 --> 06:26.908
Well, just
so you know,

06:26.908 --> 06:29.171
the only way
I will say yes,

06:29.171 --> 06:30.607
is if there is
some element

06:30.607 --> 06:32.304
of public
humiliation involved.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.871
- Oh, well.
- Get ready.

06:33.871 --> 06:35.830
You might as well just end
the relationship right now,

06:35.830 --> 06:38.180
because we ain't
- doing that.
- Oh, we're not?

06:38.180 --> 06:39.529
I'm not
- doing this.
- But you're

06:39.529 --> 06:41.052
- such a good dancer.
- Look at these people.

06:41.052 --> 06:44.360
Uh, Ellie?
I kind of need
your help right now.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.971
Right, dude,
we are in!

06:52.455 --> 06:55.110
<i>The truth was,
I had every intention</i>

06:55.110 --> 06:57.112
<i>of asking Ellie to marry me.</i>

06:58.374 --> 07:02.422
<i>I just needed
the right place and time.</i>

07:06.469 --> 07:07.688
I see you, guy.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.690
I see you.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.344
All right? Pick it up.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.956
Thank you.
- Take a walk.
Sebastian.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.958
I'm on the phone
with my parents
and get this,

07:18.829 --> 07:20.527
they're inviting us

07:21.528 --> 07:22.703
out to the summer place

07:22.703 --> 07:25.270
for the big
4th-of-July weekend.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.664
Babe, did you
- just say "us"?
- Us.

07:27.664 --> 07:28.970
I thought this trip
was for family only.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.972
I know! I mean,
I'm so torn

07:30.972 --> 07:33.061
between thinking
this is great news,

07:33.061 --> 07:34.149
or that I might be
dragging you

07:34.149 --> 07:36.107
into an Italian version
of <i>Get Out.</i>

07:36.107 --> 07:37.805
I'm not sure. Oh, uh, uh...

07:37.805 --> 07:40.851
Yes, yes, yes,
Mother, yes. I'm
asking him right now,

07:40.851 --> 07:42.287
please hold.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.593
What do you think?

07:46.944 --> 07:49.730
Yeah.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.080
He's man-crying.
That means it's a yes.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.908
- Yes!
- I love you.

07:54.691 --> 07:55.910
I'm gonna
get you tissues.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.565
I love you.
I'm so excited.

07:58.565 --> 08:01.524
<i>So, yeah,
I'm a big crier.</i>

08:01.524 --> 08:04.614
<i>I love to just marinate
in my own tears.</i>

08:04.614 --> 08:05.920
Mmm.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.922
<i>But this was a huge deal.</i>

08:09.750 --> 08:12.666
<i>Ellie's summer place wasn't
just the perfect spot</i>

08:12.666 --> 08:14.232
<i>to propose.</i>

08:14.232 --> 08:17.714
<i>It also meant her family was
starting to accept me.</i>

08:17.714 --> 08:20.282
<i>Which was amazing, because...</i>

08:20.282 --> 08:22.545
<i>How do I put this eloquently?</i>

08:22.545 --> 08:27.419
<i>These people got
class up the ass.</i>

08:30.205 --> 08:34.296
<i>I mean, look at these people
with their perfect postures,</i>

08:34.296 --> 08:36.516
<i>and their perfect teeth.</i>

08:36.516 --> 08:38.561
<i>Even their dog went
to better schools</i>

08:38.561 --> 08:40.041
<i>than I did.</i>

08:40.041 --> 08:41.433
<i>I was intimidated,</i>

08:41.433 --> 08:43.174
<i>which really didn't
make any sense</i>

08:43.174 --> 08:47.831
<i>as their story was also
an immigrant story.</i>

08:47.831 --> 08:52.140
<i>For some reason, theirs was
considered more respectable,</i>

08:52.140 --> 08:54.708
<i>as it started 400 years ago.</i>

08:54.708 --> 08:56.753
<i>Now, this is
an actual painting</i>

08:56.753 --> 08:59.060
<i>of Ellie's
10th great grandfather,</i>

08:59.060 --> 09:03.107
<i>William Love Collins,
taking his family to America,</i>

09:03.107 --> 09:06.328
<i>on a little boat called
the</i> Mayflower.

09:06.328 --> 09:09.157
<i>You got it. That one.</i>

09:09.157 --> 09:12.595
<i>So while my father came
to chase the American dream,</i>

09:12.595 --> 09:15.685
<i>the Collins were
the American dream,</i>

09:15.685 --> 09:18.079
<i>all the way
up to Ellie's dad.</i>

09:18.079 --> 09:20.734
<i>William Love Collins XII.</i>

09:20.734 --> 09:22.431
<i>Only Italian guys I knew</i>

09:22.431 --> 09:24.564
<i>with Roman numerals
after their names...</i>

09:24.564 --> 09:26.261
<i>...are popes,</i>

09:26.261 --> 09:29.220
<i>and Rocky Balboa.</i>

09:29.220 --> 09:31.092
<i>Her dad is
the chairman and CEO</i>

09:31.092 --> 09:33.529
<i>of the luxurious
Collins Hotel Group,</i>

09:33.529 --> 09:35.009
<i>which was awkward,</i>

09:35.009 --> 09:37.707
<i>as I happened to run
a cool new boutique hotel,</i>

09:37.707 --> 09:40.188
<i>which was stealing
a lot of his Chicago business.</i>

09:40.971 --> 09:42.190
<i>Bottom line?</i>

09:42.190 --> 09:45.628
<i>His baby girl was
dating the enemy.</i>

09:45.628 --> 09:48.979
<i>But Bill wasn't even
the scary parent.</i>

09:48.979 --> 09:51.547
<i>That honor belonged
to Ellie's mother,</i>

09:51.547 --> 09:56.421
<i>whose actual birth name
was Tigger MacArthur.</i>

09:56.421 --> 09:59.686
Anna, darling,
you don't know
anything about me.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.253
<i>And this kitty's got claws.</i>

10:02.253 --> 10:04.342
<i>As an Ivy League
grad-turned-senator</i>

10:04.342 --> 10:05.822
<i>for the state of Maryland,</i>

10:05.822 --> 10:07.868
<i>it took her a long time</i>

10:07.868 --> 10:11.349
<i>to wrap her mind around
her beloved daughter dating</i>

10:11.349 --> 10:14.265
<i>some working-class
hotel manager.</i>

10:14.265 --> 10:16.659
How could I be
anti-immigrant

10:16.659 --> 10:19.836
when my daughter is
dating the son of one?

10:20.924 --> 10:22.404
<i>But this invite meant</i>

10:22.404 --> 10:25.320
<i>I was finally
breaking through.</i>

10:25.320 --> 10:27.931
<i>A holiday weekend was
my chance to charm</i>

10:27.931 --> 10:30.542
<i>the pleated pants
off these people.</i>

10:30.542 --> 10:32.893
<i>And if all went well,</i>

10:32.893 --> 10:36.026
<i>I could ask
for their daughter's
hand in marriage.</i>

10:37.898 --> 10:40.814
<i>So, I had the girl
I wanted to marry,</i>

10:40.814 --> 10:43.643
<i>the perfect spot
to propose to her,</i>

10:43.643 --> 10:46.341
<i>and now,
I just needed the ring,</i>

10:46.341 --> 10:48.648
<i>which should have
been easy to get.</i>

10:48.648 --> 10:49.736
Oh, come on. What do you mean

10:49.736 --> 10:51.520
you're not gonna
give me the ring?

10:51.520 --> 10:53.609
Grandma left it for me
to use when I'm ready
to get married.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.350
Uh, your grandmother
left it with me

10:55.350 --> 10:56.960
to make sure you just
don't give it away

10:56.960 --> 10:59.136
to some <i>puttana,</i> that's what
your grandmother did.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.225
Can you come out
of the garden so
we can talk about this?

11:03.924 --> 11:06.709
They're back.
They're back there
messing with my <i>gagootz.</i>

11:06.709 --> 11:08.668
Forget the <i>gagootz.</i>

11:08.668 --> 11:10.757
Dad, the ring,
- can I have it?
- Look at that.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.498
You know,
I don't know
about this girl,

11:13.498 --> 11:15.239
I gotta tell ya.
I'm not sure
about her.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.937
She put her feet up
on my coffee table,

11:16.937 --> 11:18.373
I don't know... You put
your feet up

11:18.373 --> 11:19.548
on your
- coffee table.
- Yeah, my coffee table,

11:19.548 --> 11:20.723
my feet.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.116
What do you
think is this?

11:22.116 --> 11:24.466
- What bites? A raccoon?
- Ants? Is it an ant?

11:25.728 --> 11:27.338
An ant. You got
to to be kidding me.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.690
Let's see.
Okay, here we are.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.909
Look at them.
That's a possum.

11:32.909 --> 11:35.216
Possum. They're dead.

11:35.216 --> 11:36.739
- Dead, gone.
- Oh, no. Come on,

11:36.739 --> 11:38.741
with the thing again... Gone from this earth.

11:38.741 --> 11:41.004
- Instant death.
- Just set a trap.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.484
Yeah, I'm gonna
set a trap.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.181
I'm gonna get
my antifreeze,
my little...

11:44.181 --> 11:45.835
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

11:45.835 --> 11:48.359
<i>I thought everything
my dad did was normal.</i>

11:49.534 --> 11:51.754
<i>If some string beans
went missing,</i>

11:51.754 --> 11:55.018
<i>I'd wake up to a yard
full of poisoned squirrels,</i>

11:55.018 --> 11:57.194
<i>birds, chipmunks,</i>

11:57.194 --> 11:58.456
<i>basically anything</i>

11:58.456 --> 12:00.850
<i>that ever helped
Cinderella get dressed,</i>

12:00.850 --> 12:03.505
<i>murdered in our backyard.</i>

12:03.505 --> 12:05.246
Come on, Dad.
Could you just admit

12:05.246 --> 12:07.378
that Ellie's not
some <i>puttana?</i>

12:07.378 --> 12:08.815
I love her, you love her.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.600
Just give me the ring
so I can propose.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.906
You really serious
about this?

12:12.906 --> 12:14.472
Yeah, Dad,
she's the one.

12:14.472 --> 12:15.735
- She's the one?
- Yeah.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.997
Okay, son, you know
what I'm gonna do?

12:16.997 --> 12:18.520
I'm gonna give
- you the ring.
- Thank you.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.740
But first I gotta
meet her family.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.437
- What? Why?
- Why?

12:25.266 --> 12:27.094
-  That's why.
- What the hell
does that mean?

12:27.094 --> 12:28.965
You got
no respect
for your roots.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.358
I mean, what are
you talking about?

12:30.358 --> 12:31.533
You don't eat
the fruit till
you make sure

12:31.533 --> 12:32.839
the tree ain't sick.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.362
And per tradition,
I need to look

12:34.362 --> 12:35.929
at the mother
and the father's eyes.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.452
I need to look them
in the eyes

12:37.452 --> 12:38.975
to make sure there's no rot.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.585
Because there could be rot.
- Not that there is.
- What?

12:40.585 --> 12:42.805
- But there could be.
- There's no rot
in this family, Dad.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.154
- You never know.
- They're classy.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.939
- You never know.
- Come on, they're
classy people.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.288
Oh, yeah.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.724
The fancier,
the dirtier.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.030
You never know
what's going on.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.727
Plus, they don't live
anywhere near here.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.337
So let me just put you
on a FaceTime,

12:53.337 --> 12:55.165
so you could
taste test them
over the phone.

12:55.165 --> 12:58.168
Hey, I'm not doing FaceTime.
This is an important moment.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.953
FaceTime, Zoom?
What are you, crazy?

12:59.953 --> 13:01.868
You don't gotta
get all upset.
No, gotta be <i>faccia con faccia.</i>

13:01.868 --> 13:04.827
Dad, I want
to do this
next weekend

13:04.827 --> 13:07.221
at their family's house
in the country.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.092
Wait... wait.
Hold on, hold on.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.659
This is the first summer

13:10.659 --> 13:12.879
since we had to say goodbye
to your poor dear mother,

13:12.879 --> 13:14.054
and you're going
to leave me alone

13:14.054 --> 13:15.751
for the goddamn 4th of July?

13:15.751 --> 13:17.100
Well, it's just that,
you know,

13:17.100 --> 13:19.407
her family invited me
to their summer house.

13:19.407 --> 13:20.843
Oh, their summer home?

13:20.843 --> 13:22.062
Oh, most people got one home,
but they got 'em

13:22.062 --> 13:23.759
for different seasons.
Oh, that's nice.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.543
Come on, Dad. So they got
more money than us,

13:25.543 --> 13:28.068
who doesn't? Plus,
it's just for one weekend.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.722
Oh, one weekend, he says.
One weekend.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.637
Fifty years ago,
I come to this country

13:32.637 --> 13:33.900
to give you a better life.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.379
Fifty years ago,

13:35.379 --> 13:38.165
I skipped every weekend
in Sicily for you.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.688
I joined the US Army

13:39.688 --> 13:41.951
to protect your freedoms.
And what thanks do I get?

13:41.951 --> 13:43.735
You go celebrate
the 4th of July

13:43.735 --> 13:44.824
with some other family,

13:44.824 --> 13:45.999
leaving me
to burn the sparklers

13:45.999 --> 13:47.870
and eat the hot dogs alone!

13:47.870 --> 13:50.003
Alone! Thank you.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.180
This is incredible.

13:59.142 --> 14:01.014
Wait, what do you mean
you're not coming?

14:01.014 --> 14:03.320
I can't leave my father.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.757
The 4th of July was
their favorite holiday.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.585
Because of his
military background?

14:07.585 --> 14:10.371
No, it's the only holiday
you don't have to buy a gift.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.155
I'm sorry, Ellie.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.157
We'll just do it
some other time.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.419
Why don't
we just bring him?

14:15.419 --> 14:16.638
What happened?

14:16.638 --> 14:19.902
I mean, if he...
loves the 4th,

14:19.902 --> 14:21.817
he's gonna flip out
at our place.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.646
There's all
kinds of fun
family activities.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.996
There's fireworks.
There's even a huge clambake

14:26.996 --> 14:28.868
with tons of fresh fish.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.304
He loves to de-bone fish.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.132
Kind of perfect.

14:33.568 --> 14:36.092
<i>My father
getting a close-up look</i>

14:36.092 --> 14:37.441
<i>at my new life,</i>

14:37.441 --> 14:39.313
<i>while I was trying
to seal the deal</i>

14:39.313 --> 14:41.184
<i>with Ellie's parents?</i>

14:41.184 --> 14:43.317
<i>What an incredible idea!</i>

14:43.317 --> 14:44.622
Nah, I don't think so.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.363
I should probably
just stay here with him.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.669
Boo!

14:48.452 --> 14:50.715
Come on.

14:50.715 --> 14:53.370
Don't you want
our families
to finally meet?

14:53.370 --> 14:55.198
Yeah, of course I do.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.158
Why is your voice
going up like that?

14:58.158 --> 14:59.289
What's going on?

14:59.855 --> 15:00.900
Are you...

15:02.249 --> 15:04.425
Are you nervous
to bring him?

15:04.425 --> 15:06.296
Ner... No.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.342
No. What? No, no.

15:08.342 --> 15:09.604
All right, fine.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.562
Don't bring him.

15:11.562 --> 15:12.694
Don't come.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.916
Don't have fun.
It's fine.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.874
<i>All right,
maybe I was a little scared</i>

15:18.874 --> 15:21.572
<i>to bring my father
into a country club environment,</i>

15:21.572 --> 15:24.184
<i>where he'd see me playing
racquet sports,</i>

15:24.184 --> 15:27.883
<i>riding around in golf carts,
and taking naps.</i>

15:27.883 --> 15:30.668
<i>But I also knew
that stubborn bastard wouldn't</i>

15:30.668 --> 15:33.410
<i>give me the ring without
a face-to-face meeting.</i>

15:34.368 --> 15:36.413
Fine. You win.
I'll ask him.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.287
Hey, don't get
all excited, all right?

15:40.287 --> 15:43.029
This guy's big on tradition.
I doubt he'll even say yes.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.465
Shit, yeah. I'm coming.

15:44.465 --> 15:46.075
No, wait, wait,
wait. Seriously?

15:46.075 --> 15:47.598
Of course, I'm coming.
What are we gonna
do instead?

15:47.598 --> 15:48.730
Spend the whole
weekend alone,

15:48.730 --> 15:49.818
just the two of us
in the house,

15:49.818 --> 15:51.037
burning the sparklers

15:51.037 --> 15:53.082
and eating the hotdogs?
Yeah, I'm coming.

15:53.082 --> 15:54.431
That's the same
example you used

15:54.431 --> 15:55.867
to guilt trip me
into not going.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.565
Well, what can I say.
I got a way with words.

15:57.565 --> 15:59.001
You know me.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.089
All right, listen.
If we're gonna do this, Dad,

16:00.089 --> 16:01.438
you gotta be
on your best behavior.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.092
Wha... What do you mean,
my best behavior?

16:03.092 --> 16:04.964
The family is uptight,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.356
they're conservative,
they're not used to...

16:06.356 --> 16:07.662
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

16:07.662 --> 16:10.056
So, you, the son, are
telling me, the father,

16:10.056 --> 16:11.057
how to behave?

16:11.753 --> 16:13.407
You hear this?

16:13.407 --> 16:15.235
Just remember the main goal
is for you to meet the family,

16:15.235 --> 16:17.367
so I can get the ring
and propose to Ellie.

16:17.367 --> 16:18.499
It's not for you
to price check

16:18.499 --> 16:19.717
their antique coffee tables.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.197
Come on, already!
I mean, how fancy

16:21.197 --> 16:22.503
could a stupid
coffee table be?

16:22.503 --> 16:24.200
I mean, seriously,
how much we talking?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.420
I don't know, Dad.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.770
I'm kidding you. <i>Mannaggia.</i>
Where's
your sense of humor?

16:28.770 --> 16:29.814
- Jeez. Come on.
- All I'm asking is

16:29.814 --> 16:31.294
dial it down with the...

16:31.294 --> 16:32.382
What, all the...

16:32.382 --> 16:33.601
This is...
What is this?

16:33.601 --> 16:35.124
Look at him.
Look at him.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.299
Dial it down
with all this
and that.

16:36.299 --> 16:37.387
You know what
he's worried about?

16:37.387 --> 16:38.693
He's worried

16:38.693 --> 16:40.129
his immigrant father's
gonna make him look

16:40.129 --> 16:41.783
like some kind
of goombah.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.176
Let me tell you something.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.829
You don't remember
this because I'm your dad

16:44.829 --> 16:46.657
but a lot of people
find me charming,

16:46.657 --> 16:48.050
pretty charming,
that's right. Right.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.356
- Right, ladies?
Yeah.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.619
And these
stuck-up rich people?

16:51.619 --> 16:52.837
They got a word for me...

16:52.837 --> 16:55.101
I remember, it's loud,
it's obnoxious,

16:55.101 --> 16:56.493
it's over-cologned.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.408
No, no. "Refreshing."

16:58.408 --> 17:00.323
"He's refreshing."
"He's so original."

17:00.323 --> 17:02.630
I've heard that all...
All the time I hear that.

17:02.630 --> 17:05.285
And I promise you
Ellie's parents
are gonna love me.

17:05.285 --> 17:06.895
I don't know about
you, but they're going
to love me.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.375
- Mm-hmm.
- Ladies,
you better get

17:08.375 --> 17:09.898
your 'dos done
by Thursday

17:09.898 --> 17:12.074
'cause the Maniscalco men,
they're going on vacation.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.512
He's worried.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.558
This kid is
worried. I'm not.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.143
What the hell
are you doing?

17:37.143 --> 17:38.970
- You can't smoke here.
- What? I'm outside.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.059
Next to an airplane!

17:40.059 --> 17:42.148
- Oh, sorry!
That's okay.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.759
<i>Mannaggia.</i>
Can't even
smoke a cigar.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.413
I got some
good news.

17:46.413 --> 17:47.979
I got us
a luxury sedan

17:47.979 --> 17:49.938
for the price
of a compact.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.505
That's nice,
but makes
me wonder

17:51.505 --> 17:53.463
how much the compact
you could've got for.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.726
Then I took
the compact price

17:55.726 --> 17:57.380
and got it
on the house!

17:57.380 --> 17:59.295
- Hey!
- Hey! Nice!

17:59.295 --> 18:01.471
- Baby, the bags.
- Yeah. How long does
it take to get there?

18:01.471 --> 18:03.343
Um, like, three hours.

18:03.343 --> 18:04.909
Hey, you guys
looking for a ride?

18:05.823 --> 18:07.477
Oh, my God.

18:07.477 --> 18:08.826
Lucky!

18:08.826 --> 18:10.437
Oh, no.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.091
Who's that,
an ex-boyfriend?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.570
Worse. Brother.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.094
Hey!

18:17.052 --> 18:20.011
<i>While I'd made
progress with Ellie's parents,</i>

18:20.011 --> 18:23.145
<i>I'd yet to make any
with the older brother.</i>

18:23.145 --> 18:26.192
<i>His name was
William Love Collins XIII.</i>

18:26.192 --> 18:28.672
<i>So, everybody called
this guy "Lucky."</i>

18:28.672 --> 18:30.196

18:30.196 --> 18:31.458
<i>what he was.</i>
Chug, chug, chug,

18:31.458 --> 18:32.633
Whoo!

18:32.633 --> 18:34.069
Oh, my God!

18:34.069 --> 18:35.679
<i>After graduating
from Princeton,</i>

bribe your kid into college,</i>

Gentlemen! Who's ready to go
hunt some endangered species?

18:46.255 --> 18:47.952
I'm just kidding.
Unless you guys
are down,

18:47.952 --> 18:49.519
I can figure
something out.

18:49.519 --> 18:51.086
<i>This meant
traveling around the world,</i>

18:51.086 --> 18:52.827

I gotta change
my shoes,

19:07.146 --> 19:09.670

the dance floor. What!

19:11.628 --> 19:14.283

Hey!

19:21.029 --> 19:22.683
I'm only joking,
Sea Bass.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.773
Hey, what's up,
Luck?[IN ENGLISH] Not much.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.166
You must be
Sebastian's brother.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.993
Hey. No, I'm
his father. Salvo.
How are you?

19:28.993 --> 19:30.517
No way! Seriously?

19:30.517 --> 19:32.083
That's crazy.
I can't tell the age

19:32.083 --> 19:33.476
of anybody over 40.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.783
Anyway. Oh, let me

19:35.783 --> 19:37.915

19:48.143 --> 19:50.232
Oh, chopper time!

19:50.232 --> 19:52.234
El... El, I don't
think this is such
a good idea.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.714
Yeah, we got
a free car,
you know.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.498
Guys, come on!

19:55.498 --> 19:58.371
Trust me, the helicopter
takes 20 minutes,

19:58.371 --> 20:01.330
and the views
are magical.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.027
Are you with me?

20:03.027 --> 20:06.030
Come on! Let's
have some fun!

Dude's name is Roger. We hang.

20:11.688 --> 20:13.255
Got a super-hot wife.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.172
Hey, if you guys
look out to your left,

20:17.172 --> 20:19.479
you'll see the beautiful
Roanoke River.

20:20.131 --> 20:21.176
Baby, look.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.266
Salvo, it's nice, right?

20:24.266 --> 20:25.746
Yeah. Yeah,
yeah, it's nice.

20:25.746 --> 20:26.964
Reminds me of 'Nam.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.930
- Huh?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
It's good.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.410
- Okay. Okay.
- I'm fine.

20:39.368 --> 20:40.848
- Oh, yeah.
- Sorry. Sorry.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.066
I got it. I got it.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.766
Had a couple
too many G and Ts.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.420
- He's kidding. He's kidding.
Yeah, yeah.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.858
- The air don't work.
No, it does.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.642
It works, it works.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.644
It's okay.
Only a couple of minutes.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.733
It's just
- a little warm, Dad.
- Son, it's...

20:56.733 --> 20:58.692
I think we got a problem here.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.041
- What?
- We got
a problem here.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.608
Oh, my God! Baby!

21:01.608 --> 21:02.957
- Yeah, I can't breathe.
- Wait, wait, wait.

21:02.957 --> 21:04.611
Take a bite out of the lemon.

21:04.611 --> 21:05.829
It'll help with
the nausea.
I'm not doing a whole lemon.

21:05.829 --> 21:06.917
I'll cut it.
I'll cut it.
Don't worry.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.136
Hey.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.311
I'll cut it
into pieces.
Hold on.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.834
I got a knife.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.140
He's got a knife.
Oh, my God.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.663
- He's got a knife.
- I'm cutting the lemon.

21:13.663 --> 21:15.578
Okay, here.
Take it. Take it.
Baby, suck it.

21:15.578 --> 21:18.059
- Suck on that.
Suck on
that lemon. Suck.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.279
Just suck!
Suck, suck, suck!

21:20.279 --> 21:22.237
Sounds like
- my Saturday night.
Suck!

21:22.237 --> 21:24.065
Dude.
Do not vom in my bird.

21:24.065 --> 21:25.196
He's not gonna vom
in your bird.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.720
Just breathe
in through the nose,

21:26.720 --> 21:28.025
- out through the mouth.
Suck on that.

21:28.025 --> 21:30.245
- It's making it worse.
- Suck it!

21:30.245 --> 21:31.377
Cradle the balls.
Suck on that!

21:31.377 --> 21:32.639
You just suck!
Just suck it.

21:32.639 --> 21:35.119
- Suck the lemon!
Take it easy, kid.

21:35.119 --> 21:36.730
I think we should
turn around.
He's freaking out.

21:36.730 --> 21:37.992
It's like 19 more minutes.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.689
You can't tough
it out for 19...It stinks!

21:39.689 --> 21:41.909
Let's bring it down.
Let's bring it... Open up the windows!

21:41.909 --> 21:43.389
I'm gonna die!

21:43.389 --> 21:44.477
Put the air conditioning
- down there.
- Bring it down.

21:44.477 --> 21:45.826
- How are you so calm?
Roger,

21:45.826 --> 21:47.654
- we're coming back.
- I'm dying!
Put it down!

21:47.654 --> 21:49.525
Put it down! Ah!

21:56.619 --> 21:59.187
I knew I should've
forced him
to join the army.

21:59.187 --> 22:01.668
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Laugh it up.

22:01.668 --> 22:02.756
Laugh it up, guys.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.801
I'm just happy
I'm on the ground.

22:07.064 --> 22:10.329
Okay, gentlemen.
Welcome to White Oak.

22:11.678 --> 22:13.244
- Wow!
- Right?

22:13.244 --> 22:14.420
Ah, boy.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.944
Um, okay, so, that's
the golf course,

22:16.944 --> 22:21.340
and then
the tennis courts are
back down there.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.168
Oh, baby, look. Right there?
That's my childhood fort.

22:24.168 --> 22:25.561
Oh.
We'd go there.

22:25.561 --> 22:26.562
whenever I needed
to get away from my family.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.347
So, basically, all the time.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.826
Yeah, I wish
I had one.

22:29.826 --> 22:32.786
Oh, look!

22:32.786 --> 22:36.790
Oh, my God! It's
Sergeant Feathers
and his family!

22:36.790 --> 22:38.835
What is this?
- Oh, my God!

22:38.835 --> 22:40.707
What are you doing?

22:40.707 --> 22:42.273
-  What up, dudes?
What are you...
Is this safe?

22:42.273 --> 22:43.623
Yeah, no, she's crazy.

22:43.623 --> 22:46.060
What's that? What are
you doing? Be careful.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.409
Get back in the car!

22:47.409 --> 22:49.368
They're gonna eat you alive!

22:49.368 --> 22:50.586
- Oh, my God!
- Aren't they
the best?

22:50.586 --> 22:51.674
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.241
They're
so beautiful!

22:53.241 --> 22:54.982
So how much
a peacock cost anyway?

22:54.982 --> 22:56.505
Don't answer that, El.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.638
I didn't know they had
peacocks in Virginia.

22:58.638 --> 23:01.815
Oh, well,
my grandfather brought
two here decades ago,

23:01.815 --> 23:03.207
but they didn't
like their cages,

23:03.207 --> 23:04.731
so he decided
to let them roam free.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.080
And now, they've
pretty much just become

23:06.080 --> 23:08.038
the official mascots
of our club.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.736
Well, they're bad luck
where I come from.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.651
They're just a bunch
of goddamn showoffs,

23:11.651 --> 23:13.609
if you ask me.
I don't like them.

23:13.609 --> 23:14.828
They're lucky
to be born that way.

23:14.828 --> 23:15.872
They could've been
born like a chicken,

23:15.872 --> 23:17.091
or a pigeon.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.701
I mean, it just has
fancy feathers,

23:18.701 --> 23:20.573
so all of a sudden,
it gets more respect.

23:20.573 --> 23:23.706
Okay, guys.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.752
We're here.
Welcome to our house.

23:27.493 --> 23:30.931
Look at this!
Are you kidding me?

23:30.931 --> 23:32.280
How much
a house like this cost?

23:32.280 --> 23:34.848
Enough
with the <i>Price is Right!</i>

23:34.848 --> 23:36.937
He's the Bob Barker
of the backseat.

23:38.504 --> 23:41.202
Oh, my little
cuddle monkey!
Hey! Hi!

23:41.202 --> 23:42.595
Hi.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.597
- Oh, my girl.
Oh!

23:44.597 --> 23:46.642
- Oh, what a beauty!
- Ellie-Bellie!

23:46.642 --> 23:48.383
<i>You know,
looking back at this,</i>

23:48.383 --> 23:50.429
<i>my dad had to be overwhelmed.</i>

23:50.429 --> 23:52.039
Family's a little
handsy, huh?

23:52.039 --> 23:54.215
It's called
love and
affection, Dad.

23:54.215 --> 23:55.956
Unlike you,
when you met me
in the delivery room

23:55.956 --> 23:57.392
and chose
to shake
my hand.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.438
What else was I
supposed to do?
We just met.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.309
Huh?

24:01.309 --> 24:02.397
Guys,
come on. I want
you to meet

24:02.397 --> 24:04.051
Sebastian's father.

24:04.051 --> 24:05.182
- Hey, Sebastian.
- Hi.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.575
Nice to see you.

24:06.575 --> 24:07.663
- Pleasure. Welcome.
Nice
to meet you.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.056
Sebastian,
so good
to see you.

24:10.318 --> 24:14.061
And you must be
the charming Salvo.

24:14.061 --> 24:16.759
So nice to
finally meet you
in person, Tigger.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.282
It's just last week
I was checking out

24:18.282 --> 24:20.197
your highlights
on TV.

24:20.197 --> 24:22.373
Oh, the CNN
or the Fox ones?

24:22.373 --> 24:23.810
No, no,
the blonde ones.

24:23.810 --> 24:25.376
You hair,
if I can say, is

24:25.376 --> 24:26.726
just like
a block
of marble.

24:26.726 --> 24:28.379
I wanna sink
my tools into it.

24:28.379 --> 24:29.903
Dad, Dad,
Dad, what are
you doing?

24:29.903 --> 24:31.426
Sorry, I mean, it's... You're gonna hit her.

24:31.426 --> 24:33.515
Well, Salvo, we've
heard you're quite
the stylist.

24:33.515 --> 24:34.777
Now, tell me this,

24:34.777 --> 24:36.170
do you think
I'm too old
to pull off

24:36.170 --> 24:37.345
a set of
frosted tips?

24:41.044 --> 24:42.437
"Frosted tips?"

24:42.437 --> 24:44.744
Good one, sir! Solid gold!

24:44.744 --> 24:46.223
All right,
I'm gonna
hit the links.

24:46.223 --> 24:47.442
Have fun!
<i>Hasta luego!</i>

24:47.442 --> 24:49.488
So, uh, why
don't you
come inside,

24:49.488 --> 24:51.141
and we'll
give you
the grand tour.

24:51.141 --> 24:52.621
Don't worry
about the bags.

24:52.621 --> 24:54.493
Wendell will
take care
of them.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.798
Mommy...

24:55.798 --> 24:57.104
That's
a pretty big dog
you got there.

24:57.104 --> 24:59.062
Oh, that's Duke.

24:59.062 --> 25:00.324
We don't get too rough
with him, 'cause we're
afraid he'll kill us.

25:00.324 --> 25:01.891
He's so big!

25:01.891 --> 25:03.110
Dad!
This is our house.

25:03.110 --> 25:04.503
Wow!
Yes.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.939
It's unbelievable.
It's so big.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.288
Oh, this is

25:07.288 --> 25:10.247
our youngest son, Doug.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.510
He's practicing... ELLIE: Hi!

25:11.510 --> 25:13.250
...his sound bowls.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.339
Oh, yeah... Sound bowls?
What is that?

25:15.339 --> 25:17.167
Oh, well, now,
a sound bowl is...

25:17.167 --> 25:18.604
It's, actually,
it's an instrument.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.910
It puts out
this vibration

25:20.910 --> 25:23.739
that relieves stress
and promotes relaxation.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.176
He's...
he's learning
to be a healer.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.615
Uh, but we're
just so proud
of him.

25:29.615 --> 25:30.964
You're so loud, Dad.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.487
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.794
Let me just...
Sorry. No, I'm
gonna close the...

25:34.794 --> 25:36.143
Play, boy, play.

25:36.143 --> 25:39.015
Play to soothe
the savage beast.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.713
Well, you don't have
to shut 'em.

25:42.062 --> 25:44.891
Wow! This house
is amazing!

25:44.891 --> 25:46.719
- Look at this!
This is nothing.

25:46.719 --> 25:48.242
You should see
the place in Aspen.

25:48.242 --> 25:50.897
Well, it's just,
you know...

25:50.897 --> 25:53.769
- Yeah.
- I love this
cocktail table.

25:53.769 --> 25:56.293
Oh, Sebastian!

25:56.293 --> 25:58.339
Good eye!

25:58.339 --> 26:01.690
The first
commercial coal mine
in the country was

26:01.690 --> 26:02.996
right down
the road
from here,

26:02.996 --> 26:05.999
and this piece is
made out
of the wood

26:05.999 --> 26:08.654
from one
of the original
mine cars.

26:08.654 --> 26:11.395
Drenched
- in history.
- Drenched.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.136
Good for you,
re-using old wood
like that.

26:13.136 --> 26:14.660
Yes.
- This guy always
gets on me

26:14.660 --> 26:16.400
about picking up
trash and putting
it in the house.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.098
Trash?

26:18.098 --> 26:19.665
It's crazy, the stuff
that people throw
away these days.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.405
It sure beats
paying for it,
I mean, right?

26:21.405 --> 26:23.538
- So, I... I take it.
- Right.

26:23.538 --> 26:25.975
Yes. Yes.
That is

26:25.975 --> 26:27.542
- so true.
- Yeah.

26:27.542 --> 26:30.284
Um, actually,
though, we did
pay for this one.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.373
A king's ransom,

26:32.373 --> 26:35.332
if I must say,
but at least
it's too rickety

26:35.332 --> 26:37.030
to put drinks on.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.553
Dad, that's
the worst.

26:38.553 --> 26:41.295
No, no, we just,
we wanted something

26:41.295 --> 26:44.037
that matched
the art
in the room.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.255
Oh, good for you,

26:45.255 --> 26:47.301
hanging up
your kids'
art work like that.

26:47.301 --> 26:53.263
No, these are
original Grandma Moseses.

26:53.263 --> 26:54.395
Can you
believe it?
I'm... I'm sorry.

26:54.395 --> 26:55.744
We
found them...
I'm sorry.

26:55.744 --> 26:57.703
What?
- I'm sorry.
I mean, I...

26:57.703 --> 26:59.313
I didn't mean
to insult your grandmother.

26:59.313 --> 27:01.576
I meant
no disrespect.
I had no idea.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.056
I mean, what was
the matter with her?

27:03.056 --> 27:04.884
Was she a little...

27:04.884 --> 27:05.972
Oh, my God.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.538
Hey, who's hungry
for lunch?

27:07.538 --> 27:09.062
- I am.
Me, me, me!

27:09.062 --> 27:10.846
We could all go
down to The Shack.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.587
Oh, Salvo,
- you're gonna love The Shack!
- What a great idea!

27:25.469 --> 27:26.557
It's me.

27:28.734 --> 27:31.127
Wow, this club
is huge, Bill.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.389
The way
you were
describing it,

27:32.389 --> 27:34.435
I expected
a place where
they're serving

27:34.435 --> 27:36.524
grilled cheese
out of a little
window, you know.

27:36.524 --> 27:39.483
Yes, I suppose
they've fixed it up
over the years.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.572
But to us
it will
always be...

27:41.572 --> 27:43.270
The Shack.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.185
This place was
built by slaves.

27:45.185 --> 27:46.708
Douglass.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.015
What, I'm not allowed
to tell the truth now?

27:49.015 --> 27:50.712
How are we supposed
to confront our problems

27:50.712 --> 27:52.888
if we don't
talk about it, Dad?

27:52.888 --> 27:54.498
No, it's true.
It's true.

27:54.498 --> 27:57.197
The... Some
of the history
down here is

27:57.197 --> 27:58.372
just...
it's brutal.

27:58.372 --> 28:00.591
- Mmm.
- It's just unthinkable.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.421
It's not on the menu,
but you can order

28:04.421 --> 28:06.423
the club sandwich
with lobster.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.295
You know, I can't
even bring
my girlfriend here

28:08.295 --> 28:09.557
because
I'm ashamed.

28:11.298 --> 28:12.821
She's
an African person.

28:12.821 --> 28:16.477
She is a person
emailing you from Africa,

28:16.477 --> 28:18.958
and to whom
you are sending
back money.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.394
We have
yet to confirm

28:20.394 --> 28:22.875
whether she's
a girl or a friend.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.920
Keep me safe
from negative energy.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.009
Hi, everyone. Welcome
to White Oak.

28:27.009 --> 28:29.925
What can
- I get you guys?
- Oh, no bread, please.

28:29.925 --> 28:32.928
Um, do you have
those crackers?
The seedy ones?

28:32.928 --> 28:35.409
- Of course.
- Gloria, do you
have kombucha?

28:35.409 --> 28:38.020
- I can check.
- Does anyone
want in on this?

28:38.020 --> 28:39.935
Ever since I've
had kombucha,

28:39.935 --> 28:42.895
my BMs have been
- ...completely regular.
Oh. All right.

28:42.895 --> 28:45.288
- I've had no problems.
- All right.
Remember, Douglass,

28:45.288 --> 28:47.813
we don't talk about
- our BMs at the table.
- No.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.597
Before I was
drinking kombucha,

28:50.206 --> 28:51.947
my feces looked like

28:51.947 --> 28:53.993
ripped,
little pieces
of paper

28:53.993 --> 28:55.603
and then after
I started drinking,

28:55.603 --> 28:57.431
they're long,
soft logs.

28:57.431 --> 29:00.390
Well, all right.
Thank you for that.

29:00.390 --> 29:02.175
Um, do you know
what you want,
Sebastian?

29:02.175 --> 29:04.438
Just a...

29:04.438 --> 29:06.745
- the Cobb salad.
Good choice.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.485
What are you, one
of my sorority sisters?

29:08.485 --> 29:10.749
Is that all
you're gonna get?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.272
You're not
gonna get
a starter?

29:12.272 --> 29:14.100
Yeah, uh,
I'm just gonna

29:14.100 --> 29:15.405
stick with the middle
of the menu.

29:15.405 --> 29:17.190
All right,
suit yourself.

29:17.190 --> 29:18.626
Salvo, what are
you gonna get?

29:18.626 --> 29:20.846
Gloria, I think
I'm gonna have the...

29:20.846 --> 29:22.935
the BLT with
the onion rings.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.980
But what's
the price
on that dish?

29:25.633 --> 29:26.852
Oh, no, we don't...

29:26.852 --> 29:31.160
Salvo, this may
sound very silly

29:31.160 --> 29:33.162
but we don't
like to put
prices on things,

29:33.162 --> 29:37.906
because it's just
an annoying reminder
of money. Right?

29:37.906 --> 29:39.690
Oh!

29:39.690 --> 29:41.431
So, everything's
for free, you mean?

29:41.431 --> 29:44.260
No. No, it is
not free.

29:44.260 --> 29:45.696
I wish it were.

29:45.696 --> 29:47.350
Nothing is free.

29:47.350 --> 29:49.570
So, what do they do?
I mean, they make up
a price, or...

29:49.570 --> 29:51.267
Oh, Dad, it's...
you know...

29:51.267 --> 29:52.529
Son, I'm talking
to Bill, here.

29:52.529 --> 29:53.792
Are you Bill?
Hello, Bill.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.228
It's fine.

29:55.228 --> 29:57.056
Everything has
- a set price.
- Mmm.

29:57.056 --> 29:59.449
And then they just
tally it up at the
end of the week,

29:59.449 --> 30:01.712
put it on my bill,
and it's
taken care of.

30:01.712 --> 30:03.236
Got it.
Okay, got it.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.759
Well, Gloria,
I would just
love to chat

30:04.759 --> 30:06.282
with somebody
who knows
the prices.

30:06.282 --> 30:07.675
Salvo, please.

30:07.675 --> 30:10.156
Please. It would
be our pleasure
to treat you.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.984
I would love that
and thank you, Tigger.

30:11.984 --> 30:14.638
But I think you do
way, way, way
too much, already.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.640
You're putting us
up in your home,

30:16.640 --> 30:19.078
that's enough already.
We want to at least,
you know, pay for the meal.

30:19.078 --> 30:20.775
- It's not a big deal.
- I know it's not
a big deal.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.124
Don't make
a big deal out
of it. It's all right.

30:22.124 --> 30:23.604
Don't worry
about it.
It's okay.

30:23.604 --> 30:25.736
So, Gloria,
just do me
a favor,

30:25.736 --> 30:27.216
find out how much
it is for the BLT.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.653
What did
you get again?
Just the Cobb salad.

30:29.653 --> 30:31.090
- Cobb salad.
Please. Please,

30:31.090 --> 30:32.569
No, we'll take
care of it.
Just let us pay.

30:32.569 --> 30:33.962
It will be
so much easier...
Just let them pay.

30:33.962 --> 30:35.703
...if you just
let them pay.
I can't let you.

30:35.703 --> 30:38.358
- ...taken care of it.
- Dad, let them pay.

30:38.358 --> 30:40.055
- Please let them pay.
- Just let us pay.

30:40.055 --> 30:41.970
- I can't let you pay.
It's so easy.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.759
I don't know
what you're
so upset about.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.805
I mean, I'm
a working guy.

30:50.805 --> 30:52.067
I like to pay
my own way.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.416
I don't want
to owe anybody anything.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.027
I'm upset because
you're supposed

30:55.027 --> 30:56.680
to be getting
to know Ellie's family.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.552
And instead,
you made a big scene.

30:58.552 --> 31:00.597
So what? Who cares?
These people are strange.

31:00.597 --> 31:01.903
Yeah, you think
they are.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.905
They are strange.
Are you kidding me?

31:03.905 --> 31:05.820
They wanna take
a break from thinking
about money.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.300
Where I come from,
that's called dying.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.997
All right, that's...

31:08.997 --> 31:11.260
It's a different life.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.566
But you still
gotta try.

31:13.175 --> 31:14.524
Try...

31:14.524 --> 31:16.091
I just don't
know, Sebastian,
I got to tell you.

31:16.091 --> 31:18.006
I don't know
how you're
gonna fit in.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.703
It ain't normal. I mean,
your mother and me,

31:19.703 --> 31:21.314
we didn't
raise you
this way, so...

31:21.314 --> 31:23.272
Yeah, you raised me
to marry an Italian

31:23.272 --> 31:24.926
who shouts
when she's happy,

31:24.926 --> 31:26.449
and grows hair
in places I didn't
even know could grow.

31:26.449 --> 31:28.060
So what? That's
a real woman.

31:28.060 --> 31:29.583
Your mother was a real woman,

31:29.583 --> 31:31.280
who put real food
on the table,

31:31.280 --> 31:33.979
not somebody
who refuses
a bread basket.

31:33.979 --> 31:35.415
All right, Dad,
even I have to admit

31:35.415 --> 31:37.721
- the crackers were awful.
- It's like
eating birdseed.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.375
Yeah. I didn't know
whether to eat 'em
with my hands

31:39.375 --> 31:40.594
or just walk
around and...

31:44.250 --> 31:46.121
Exactly, and you notice
how they try to downplay

31:46.121 --> 31:47.427
how fancy it is?

31:47.427 --> 31:48.602
Oh, yeah."Excuse me?

31:48.602 --> 31:50.038
"I'm looking at this.

31:50.038 --> 31:52.258
"Excuse me.
I got eyes.
I can see. Hello."

31:52.258 --> 31:53.781
They walk around,
saying, "Oh, yes.

31:53.781 --> 31:56.131
"The house is
60,000 square feet,

31:56.131 --> 31:57.524
"with 13 bedrooms,

31:57.524 --> 31:59.918
"but we like it
because it's cozy."

31:59.918 --> 32:01.832
And then they do
the opposite
with the furniture.

32:01.832 --> 32:03.269
They make it sound
more important

32:03.269 --> 32:04.574
than it really is.

32:04.574 --> 32:06.446
It can't just be
like a regular chair.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.143
It's got to have like
a whole back story.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.362
- Oh, yeah.
- I mean, what...

32:09.362 --> 32:11.538
"This is the chair
Thomas Jefferson sat in

32:11.538 --> 32:13.844
"when he signed
the treaty of
Who-the-Hell-Cares?"

32:13.844 --> 32:16.456
"Well, the toilet is where
Abe Lincoln took a dump.

32:16.456 --> 32:17.979
"There's a plaque
right there."

32:17.979 --> 32:20.503
"Oh, do they got a place
for his hat in there, too?"

32:20.503 --> 32:21.852
I mean, I don't know
if I'm in a house

32:21.852 --> 32:23.158
or I'm in a museum.

32:24.290 --> 32:26.727
So, tell us,
what's new
in Chicago?

32:26.727 --> 32:28.511
How's the art?

32:28.511 --> 32:31.079
Well, it's, um... Yes?

32:31.079 --> 32:32.689
- It's great.
- Yes.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.561
All my pieces
from my last show

32:34.561 --> 32:36.955
sold out at the opening.
I mean...

32:36.955 --> 32:38.957
Well, that's
something...
That's amazing!

32:38.957 --> 32:40.393
- ...to crow about.
- Yeah, right?

32:40.393 --> 32:43.222
So, now that
you're getting
all these contacts,

32:43.222 --> 32:46.051
you could probably
work from anywhere.

32:46.051 --> 32:49.793
- Mom, stop, no.
- Right, sweetie?
Right?

32:49.793 --> 32:51.578
Sebastian and I
love living
in Chicago.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.058
Oh.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.712
But we miss
having you
there in D.C.

32:55.712 --> 32:57.932
We really do.
- We really do.
- We do.

32:57.932 --> 32:59.238
These cheeks
aren't as fun

32:59.238 --> 33:00.630
to kiss
on FaceTime.

33:00.630 --> 33:01.892
Oh, my God.
I want a cheek, too.

33:01.892 --> 33:03.329
Where's my cheek?
Where's my cheek?

33:03.329 --> 33:06.636
Excuse me. Excuse me.

33:06.636 --> 33:08.116
You guys aren't supposed
to be talking

33:08.116 --> 33:09.378
- during a sound bath.
- Oh, God.

33:09.378 --> 33:11.206
Oh, of course.
Sorry. Sorry, Dougie.

33:11.206 --> 33:12.468
No. No, this is... Sorry, sorry, sorry.

33:12.468 --> 33:13.992
This is wonderful.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.907
Please keep
bathing us
in sound.

33:16.907 --> 33:19.084
- Yes.
- Go, with
your... Yeah.

33:19.084 --> 33:22.174
Dad, listen. We're here
because I wanna marry Ellie.

33:22.174 --> 33:24.393
So, it don't matter
how it works
with these people.

33:24.393 --> 33:25.829
It works with her.

33:25.829 --> 33:27.744
So, come on.
Tomorrow, please,

33:27.744 --> 33:29.746
can you give
these people
a chance?

33:29.746 --> 33:32.836
Got it. Got it.
No problem, no problem.

33:32.836 --> 33:34.969
Because at the end
of the day, son,
it's your life.

33:36.579 --> 33:37.972
- Night cologne?
- Yep.

33:46.285 --> 33:48.417
Look at this.
Pink sheets?

33:48.417 --> 33:49.462
What?

33:51.029 --> 33:52.595
Well, we're
in a dollhouse.

33:56.164 --> 33:58.514
Mom, Dad,
I would love

33:58.514 --> 34:00.386
to live closer,
you know that.

34:00.386 --> 34:02.518
- And?
- But...

34:02.518 --> 34:04.868
Sebastian has
his dad,

34:04.868 --> 34:06.870
- and a great job.
- Yeah, working

34:06.870 --> 34:08.394
for the damn Hiltons.

34:08.394 --> 34:09.830
- The Hiltons.
- Such a good gig.

34:09.830 --> 34:11.527
Do you still have
to have herpes to work there?

34:11.527 --> 34:13.703
The point is... Thank you
for that.

34:13.703 --> 34:16.619
...that he loves it,

34:16.619 --> 34:19.013
and I couldn't
just ask him
to leave.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.494
Sure, but that house
that you guys live in,

34:21.494 --> 34:24.279
- it's so cramped.
- We prefer "modest."

34:24.279 --> 34:26.716
You don't go
on vacations.
Because we're working.

34:26.716 --> 34:28.109
And
all that cologne?

34:28.109 --> 34:30.024
They made my chopper smell
like a Nordstrom's.

34:30.024 --> 34:31.460
God! I hate it

34:31.460 --> 34:34.333
when you guys
gang up on me
like this.

34:34.333 --> 34:36.378
It's not fair!
And like it or not,

34:36.900 --> 34:37.988
Mom, Dad,

34:39.164 --> 34:40.469
and Lucky... Ow!

34:40.469 --> 34:42.732
Sebastian and I are
very happy together,

34:42.732 --> 34:44.865
and we're staying
in Chicago.

34:44.865 --> 34:46.475
I'm sorry, Dougie.

34:46.475 --> 34:48.608
Okay. I can't open
chakras like this.

34:48.608 --> 34:50.479
I'm gonna go
call my girlfriend.

34:50.479 --> 34:52.786
-  Oh, no!
- It's fine.
It's fine.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.092
Oh, shit!

34:55.049 --> 34:56.181
Bitcoin's down.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.924
Will you look at us?
Walking through

35:00.924 --> 35:04.232
a gated community
as guests.

35:04.232 --> 35:05.625
Not groundskeepers.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.192
Yeah. Well,
I just hope

35:07.192 --> 35:08.758
nothing gets stolen
this weekend,

35:08.758 --> 35:10.847
'cause these people
love to blame
the immigrants.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.415
Look at this one.
Look at this one.

35:13.415 --> 35:15.591
What'd she do?
Take the gym
equipment home?

35:15.591 --> 35:16.940
- Morning!
- Hello.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.333
Beautiful day,
isn't it?
Yeah.

35:18.333 --> 35:20.335
- Beautiful.
- Yeah. Yeah.

35:20.335 --> 35:22.337
You gotta be kidding me.
What the hell's her problem?

35:22.337 --> 35:23.817
"Beautiful day."
Give me a break.

35:23.817 --> 35:25.471
She's happy, Dad.

35:25.471 --> 35:28.213
She probably had
a father that let her
sleep in past 5:45.

35:28.213 --> 35:29.475
I mean, I can't
stop thinking

35:29.475 --> 35:30.911
about how much work
I'm missing.

35:30.911 --> 35:32.565
I could've done
four dyes
and a perm by now.

35:32.565 --> 35:34.480
Two electric bills
I could've paid. Two.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.090
- Good morning.
- Hello.

35:37.265 --> 35:39.049
"Good morning."
Come on.

35:39.049 --> 35:41.269
What you talking about?
She's in a bathrobe.
I can't believe this.

35:41.269 --> 35:43.010
I mean, don't
these people
have jobs?

35:43.010 --> 35:44.533
It's a holiday weekend.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.840
Plus, they got
their money in
the stock market.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.973
Not mayonnaise jars
buried in their backyard.

35:49.973 --> 35:52.106
Just relax.
Come on, Dad.

35:52.106 --> 35:54.848
It's a beautiful day!

36:02.247 --> 36:04.510
Back and forth,
back and forth.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.860
You play this game?
Come on.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.209
The outfits?

36:08.209 --> 36:09.819
The wives
with their <i>culos</i>
hanging out

36:09.819 --> 36:11.647
for everybody
to see?

36:11.647 --> 36:13.171
And when
they hit a ball,
it sounds like

36:13.171 --> 36:14.302
they're having
an orgasm. They're
hitting a ball.

36:15.869 --> 36:17.958
Come on. The only reason
I agreed to play is

36:17.958 --> 36:19.829
so you could spend
some time with Bill.

36:19.829 --> 36:21.483
So just relax
and do what
we came to do.

36:21.483 --> 36:22.745
Yeah, I am relaxed.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.182
Look, I got
sandals on.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.358
I'm relaxed.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.534
You look like
the guy who killed
John Wick's dog.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.188
Who's that?
I don't even
know who that is.

36:32.581 --> 36:34.757
So Ellie tells me
you're quite the player.

36:34.757 --> 36:36.411
Yeah, I've taken
a couple lessons.

36:36.411 --> 36:37.978
Well, get ready
to bring it.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.285
I love my family everywhere,

36:40.285 --> 36:42.635
except on
the tennis court.

36:42.635 --> 36:43.940
- Chest-bump!
- Oh, wow!

36:43.940 --> 36:46.204
Oh, jeez, that's
uncomfortable.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.075
Let's do this.
Mom, you ready?

36:56.475 --> 36:57.998
It's time
for tennis, baby!

36:59.434 --> 37:01.349
So, hey, Bill...
Yeah?

37:01.349 --> 37:03.482
So how long
you been in the
hotel business?

37:03.482 --> 37:05.484
Oh, yes, well,
50 years.

37:05.484 --> 37:07.747
A long time.
My whole life. Yeah.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.445
But then it's...

37:10.445 --> 37:12.752
I guess it's
a pretty exciting
thing to do.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.493
I love it. I love it.
I got... I got hotel...

37:14.493 --> 37:16.625
I got... I got
hotels in
my blood.

37:16.625 --> 37:18.148
Just like
you have hair
in your blood.

37:18.148 --> 37:19.628
Right? I mean...

37:19.628 --> 37:22.631
Yo, Sea Bass.
Hope you got on
your oven mitts.

37:22.631 --> 37:24.154
'Cause here comes the heat.

37:24.154 --> 37:26.244
Oh.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.072
Oh, my God!
Sorry.

37:29.072 --> 37:30.639
What the hell was
that, Sebastian?

37:30.639 --> 37:32.554
Ellie told me you had game.

37:32.554 --> 37:34.164
- Sorry.
Didn't
come easy.

37:34.164 --> 37:35.992
I got, uh,
kicked out
of Harvard

37:35.992 --> 37:37.820
for playing
the sax. I know,
it's a long story.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.474
But my dad,
he got mad.
He said,

37:39.474 --> 37:41.215
"That's it.
You make it
on your own."

37:41.215 --> 37:43.739
He gave me
one hotel. One.

37:43.739 --> 37:45.132
- Wow.
- Yeah.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.481
That's
- impressive.
- Well...

37:48.657 --> 37:50.180
My father
gave me
a mule.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.270
Next day
it died.

37:54.881 --> 37:56.317
Gah!

37:56.317 --> 37:58.754
<i>♪ Put the macaroni
in the pot and cook it ♪</i>

38:01.583 --> 38:03.063
What's
that, Doug?

38:03.063 --> 38:04.717
It's an adult
coloring book.

38:08.373 --> 38:09.809
Hey,
man, you wanna
take a break

38:09.809 --> 38:12.377
for some more water
or some more
tennis lessons?

38:14.988 --> 38:17.251
What is going on?

38:17.251 --> 38:18.600
- What?
- You love tennis,

38:18.600 --> 38:20.036
and it's like
you're not even
trying out here.

38:20.036 --> 38:21.473
Come on, it's
just a game.

38:21.473 --> 38:22.952
Well...

38:22.952 --> 38:24.345
All right.
At least
take off

38:24.345 --> 38:25.738
this stupid
- tracksuit.
- No, it's cold.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.130
Leave it on.
- Leave it on.
- You must be sweating...

38:27.130 --> 38:28.610
No, I'm cold.
I'm cold....your tits off!

38:28.610 --> 38:30.220
You're not cold.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.703
Wait a sec. Are you
embarrassed to play

38:34.703 --> 38:36.009
because your dad
is watching?

38:36.009 --> 38:37.271
Listen, he's not
the biggest fan

38:37.271 --> 38:38.620
of sports like this.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.230
And I don't
really feel like
going over there

38:40.230 --> 38:41.536
and explaining to him

38:41.536 --> 38:43.538
that I'm paying a guy
to teach me how to play.

38:43.538 --> 38:45.584
Well, you should know
that my mother is not

38:45.584 --> 38:48.326
a "big fan"
of losing either.

38:50.589 --> 38:53.287
Yeah.

38:53.287 --> 38:55.811
Listen, at least
she stopped
chest-bumping me.

38:55.811 --> 38:57.987
The only breasts
I wanna feel in
this family are yours.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.338
Not if you lose.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.341
Sebastian,
did Ellie
ever tell you

39:03.341 --> 39:04.646
about the guy
she dated,

39:04.646 --> 39:07.388
during her semester
abroad in Scotland?

39:07.388 --> 39:09.695
Is that
Andy-frickin'-Murray?

39:09.695 --> 39:12.524
Never lost
a match with him
on my team.

39:12.524 --> 39:14.003
I wonder what
he's up to.

39:14.003 --> 39:15.527
Hey, you know what?
I'll play with my weak hand.

39:15.527 --> 39:17.833
That way
you guys have,
like, a shot.

39:19.661 --> 39:21.097
Is that cool, Mom?

39:21.097 --> 39:23.361
<i>Until then,
my nightmare had been</i>

39:23.361 --> 39:26.146
<i>letting my father
see me enjoy this life.</i>

39:33.240 --> 39:35.024
<i>So, much like the kick serve</i>

39:35.024 --> 39:38.637
<i>I learned from a Swedish pro
named Johannes,</i>

39:38.637 --> 39:40.552
<i>this would be the point</i>

39:40.552 --> 39:42.075
<i>of no return.</i>

39:45.339 --> 39:46.558
Ooh!

40:21.419 --> 40:22.637
Oh, no.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.509
You see this?

40:24.509 --> 40:27.076
Crud! I am calm!

40:27.076 --> 40:28.382
Serve!

40:31.167 --> 40:32.952
This a game
you can
pick up fast?

40:34.344 --> 40:35.433
Not at this level.

40:41.090 --> 40:42.178
My, my.

40:42.178 --> 40:44.746
Sebastian,
he's got game.

40:44.746 --> 40:46.139
You must be
very proud.

41:03.635 --> 41:05.637
Lucky! Are
you okay?

41:05.637 --> 41:06.986
No, I'm not okay.

41:06.986 --> 41:08.901
So sorry, Luck.

41:08.901 --> 41:11.077
Oh, that's okay, Sebastian.

41:11.077 --> 41:12.513
I'm sure it was
an accident.

41:12.513 --> 41:13.645
Oh, my God.

41:13.645 --> 41:15.211
Quick! Bill!

41:15.211 --> 41:18.388
Get a small cup
of ice water
for his testes.

41:18.388 --> 41:19.607
Here.
What?

41:19.607 --> 41:21.043
I'm way
ahead of you, sweetheart.

41:21.043 --> 41:22.392
No, no, no. no.
- Here, this
is ice tea.

41:22.392 --> 41:23.393
- It's not gonna hurt.
- Easy, son.
Rest easy.

41:23.393 --> 41:24.743
- Nice and cool.
- We're gonna cool

41:24.743 --> 41:26.614
my future
- grandbabies.
- Stop what you're doing!

41:26.614 --> 41:28.050
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.
Do you want me

41:28.050 --> 41:29.182
to squeeze one, sweetie...
Take these. Hold these.

41:29.182 --> 41:30.400
...just to feel
how it is?
Trust me.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.054
Don't touch.
Oh, okay.

41:32.054 --> 41:33.403
<i>When did
you learn to play tennis
like that, anyway?</i>

41:33.403 --> 41:35.928
I took a few lessons
for Ellie, all right?

41:35.928 --> 41:37.016
It's not that big
of a deal.

41:37.016 --> 41:38.452
So how much
this cost you?

41:38.452 --> 41:40.323
<i>To all
the immigrant kids watching,</i>

41:40.323 --> 41:42.543
<i>you know when
you get that question,</i>

41:42.543 --> 41:44.327
<i>you always give them
the parent price.</i>

41:44.327 --> 41:45.415
Uh, $40.

41:45.415 --> 41:46.895
Forty? You're
telling me

41:46.895 --> 41:47.983
you paid the price

41:47.983 --> 41:49.158
of a long hair blowout

41:49.158 --> 41:51.291
for somebody
to teach you
a game?

41:51.291 --> 41:53.032
I mean,
what am
I gonna say?

41:53.032 --> 41:55.164
<i>Now, just imagine
how he'd react if I told him</i>

41:55.164 --> 41:57.210
<i>the actual price was 80.</i>

41:57.210 --> 41:59.908
Next thing I know,
you'll be serving me
the bird crackers.

42:01.301 --> 42:03.042
Son, serve me
the bird crackers.
Come on.

42:03.956 --> 42:05.697
It's a hobby, Dad.

42:05.697 --> 42:07.568
A lot of people have
them, all right?

42:07.568 --> 42:09.004
Stop acting
like I'm
joining a cult.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.092
Well, it is a cult.

42:10.092 --> 42:11.354
Only instead
of Kool-Aid,

42:11.354 --> 42:12.530
they're serving champagne.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.532
Mmm.

42:16.577 --> 42:17.622
Welcome,
everyone,

42:17.622 --> 42:18.710
to the
<i>S.S. Collins.</i>

42:18.710 --> 42:21.495
Uh, fun fact.
I won this boat,

42:21.495 --> 42:22.844
playing
backgammon

42:22.844 --> 42:24.237
with Sir Richard Branson.

42:24.237 --> 42:26.631
So for us,
every voyage is
a Virgin one.

42:28.197 --> 42:29.416
- Good one, sir.
- Thanks.

42:29.416 --> 42:31.113
Now, Bill and I
have been talking,

42:31.113 --> 42:33.638
and we were
going to wait

42:33.638 --> 42:35.335
until the weekend
to do this,

42:35.335 --> 42:37.511
but, um,
now we're just
too excited.

42:37.511 --> 42:39.687
All right.
Uh, Sebastian,

42:39.687 --> 42:42.255
as a lifelong hotelier,

42:42.255 --> 42:44.605
and the father
of the most
wonderful girl

42:44.605 --> 42:46.259
in the world... I love you.

42:46.259 --> 42:48.348
...I have to say,
it just killed me...

42:48.348 --> 42:50.393
killed...
Kills us.
Kills us. Yes.

42:50.393 --> 42:51.656
We are dead,

42:51.656 --> 42:54.093
thinking that
you are working

42:54.093 --> 42:55.790
for our biggest competitor.

42:55.790 --> 42:57.400
So... Go on.

42:57.400 --> 42:58.532
Shall I?Yes.

42:58.532 --> 43:00.142
- Right now?
- Please do.

43:00.142 --> 43:01.883
Okay.
- Daddy,
what is it?

43:01.883 --> 43:05.365
On behalf
of the Collins
Hotel group,

43:05.365 --> 43:07.193
I would love you
to join our side

43:07.193 --> 43:09.238
and become
the new face

43:09.238 --> 43:12.198
of the luxurious
five-star experience,

43:12.198 --> 43:14.113
that is...
drum roll,

43:16.637 --> 43:18.030
The Barrymore Hotel.

43:18.030 --> 43:19.118
Go on. Yeah.

43:19.118 --> 43:20.293
Not kidding.

43:20.293 --> 43:22.164
What?
Are you serious?

43:22.164 --> 43:23.601
Not kidding.
Very serious.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.254
This is
your signature property.

43:25.254 --> 43:26.995
The most
prestigious hotel
in D.C.

43:26.995 --> 43:28.257
Yeah,
it better be.
We just spent

43:28.257 --> 43:30.477
$240 million
restoring it.

43:30.477 --> 43:33.219
Uh, Dad, I thought
you were saving
that job for me.

43:33.219 --> 43:34.873
We regularly drug test.

43:34.873 --> 43:36.962
Oh. Okay then.

43:36.962 --> 43:39.051
Mom, Dad,
this is
so generous.

43:39.051 --> 43:40.487
We
wouldn't do this

43:40.487 --> 43:43.098
if we didn't think
he was perfect
for the job.

43:43.098 --> 43:45.144
Come on, let's
go get some
more champagne.

43:45.144 --> 43:46.232
- Let's take a look.
- I mean...

43:46.232 --> 43:47.537
Let's take
a look at...
What?

43:47.537 --> 43:48.713
...what you're... I can't
believe this.

43:48.713 --> 43:49.888
...going to be
the new manager of.

43:49.888 --> 43:51.541
Now this was
built in 1896.

43:51.541 --> 43:53.369
It's been completely restored,

43:53.369 --> 43:55.937
down to the dings
and the doorknobs.

43:57.591 --> 43:59.593
Take a look.
No, they're all... Everything.

43:59.593 --> 44:02.074
Hey, uh, Doug,
what are you doing?

44:02.074 --> 44:04.206
Just getting
the blood flowing.

44:05.555 --> 44:06.731
Your face is
getting a little red.

44:07.470 --> 44:09.342
Yeah, I... I feel dizzy.

44:10.169 --> 44:11.953
Yeah, me, too.

44:11.953 --> 44:14.086
Oh, that's the
Jackie Onassis boardroom.

44:14.086 --> 44:16.131
She was never there,
but we wish she would
have been.

44:17.872 --> 44:20.353
This painting
in the lobby
here looks...

44:20.353 --> 44:23.748
Yes, we... There's art.
Oh, we have... Yes.

44:23.748 --> 44:25.271
This painting
in the board room.

44:25.271 --> 44:27.534
Yeah, there's
a painting.
I recognize that sunset.

44:27.534 --> 44:29.710
Wait a minute.
Did you buy
Ellie's paintings?

44:29.710 --> 44:32.147
- Does she know?
- We bought a few

44:32.147 --> 44:33.975
through this designer
that we know,

44:33.975 --> 44:35.542
it's no big deal.

44:35.542 --> 44:38.763
We're supporting
our baby's dream.

44:38.763 --> 44:41.026
Let's close this.

44:41.026 --> 44:42.331
A little champagne.

44:42.331 --> 44:44.072
Oh, good.
I'll have some.
I'll have some.

44:44.072 --> 44:45.465
Excuse me, Daddy.

44:47.554 --> 44:49.556
So, what are
you thinking?

44:49.556 --> 44:51.558
Yeah, well, Bill,
that's a very
generous offer,

44:51.558 --> 44:54.213
but Sebastian
obviously has to
think about that.

44:54.213 --> 44:55.388
Right?

44:55.388 --> 44:56.998
Yeah.
Absolutely, Dad. Yeah.

44:56.998 --> 44:59.305
Of course.
This would be

44:59.305 --> 45:00.741
a big move
for everyone,

45:00.741 --> 45:03.396
so please,
take your time.

45:03.396 --> 45:04.876
- Talk it over.
- Right.

45:04.876 --> 45:06.529
And then tell us
what day to send
the moving trucks.

45:08.227 --> 45:10.185
Dad.

45:10.185 --> 45:13.101
Oh, this is
so cool!
So cool!

45:13.101 --> 45:14.668
Hey, as
a possible member

45:14.668 --> 45:17.932
of our, um,
family company,

45:17.932 --> 45:19.934
how about we celebrate with
a little jet-booting, huh?

45:19.934 --> 45:21.719
Oh, that sounds
great, man.
Count me in.

45:21.719 --> 45:23.155
What's jet-booting?

45:24.591 --> 45:27.202
Whoo! Whoa!

45:27.202 --> 45:29.335
This is amazing, Lucky!

45:29.335 --> 45:30.858
All right! Look at you.

45:30.858 --> 45:33.078
Baby, you're doing so good!

45:33.078 --> 45:35.558
I feel like I'm flying! Whoa!

45:35.558 --> 45:37.604
- Use your core!
- I'm actually smiling.

45:37.604 --> 45:39.824
This smile is real.

45:41.042 --> 45:42.391
Salvo, would
you like

45:42.391 --> 45:44.176
to borrow some
swim trunks?

45:44.176 --> 45:45.960
We have
a hot tub upstairs.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.570
I'm fine.
I'm trying
to watch him.

45:47.570 --> 45:49.050
- Oh.
- Make sure
he's okay.

45:50.269 --> 45:52.053
Hey...

45:52.053 --> 45:53.838
I just wanted
to thank you

45:53.838 --> 45:57.015
for looking
after Ellie
in Chicago.

45:57.015 --> 45:59.626
We feel so lucky
she's met your son.

45:59.626 --> 46:01.410
Well, he's a good kid. Thanks.

46:01.410 --> 46:02.890
I'm king
of the world!

46:02.890 --> 46:04.370
Always out making
an ass of himself.

46:07.416 --> 46:09.114
I know
you guys are close,

46:09.114 --> 46:12.552
so if they do
end up in D.C.,

46:12.552 --> 46:15.598
I promise we will
take good care of him.

46:15.598 --> 46:17.078
Honestly, I wouldn't
get your hopes up.

46:17.078 --> 46:19.951
I can't imagine Sebastian
ever leaving Chicago or me.

46:19.951 --> 46:21.387
'Cause I'm
the only family
he's got.

46:22.997 --> 46:25.173
I used to say
the same thing
about Ellie.

46:28.786 --> 46:31.005
Hey, Dad!
Check it out!
I can dive!

46:34.269 --> 46:37.011
Look at that.
He's very athletic.
He's quite good.

46:37.011 --> 46:38.534
Dad!

46:38.534 --> 46:39.666
Yeah, he gets it
from my side.

46:39.666 --> 46:40.885
Whoa!

46:42.190 --> 46:43.713
Whoo-hoo!

46:43.713 --> 46:44.845
Look at this!

46:46.847 --> 46:48.196
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, shit!

46:49.589 --> 46:51.112
Sebastian,
- your suit!
- It's Versace.

46:51.112 --> 46:52.287
Do you like it?

46:52.287 --> 46:54.420
No, you moron!
It's not up!

46:54.420 --> 46:56.726
- Look down!
Oh, God!

46:56.726 --> 46:59.033
Hey, Bubba Gump! Nice shrimp!

46:59.033 --> 47:00.861
I can't get it. Whoa!

47:01.340 --> 47:02.602
Oh!

47:02.602 --> 47:03.690
Whoa! You good, man?

47:05.431 --> 47:06.780
What's the matter
with you?

47:06.780 --> 47:08.260
Pull up your pants!

47:08.260 --> 47:09.914
I can't reach it.

47:09.914 --> 47:12.655
Hey, what the hell
do I do?

47:12.655 --> 47:14.919
Son, your sail
is at half-mast.

47:14.919 --> 47:17.399
Oh, no, no, uh,
it looks like
it's full mast.

47:17.399 --> 47:18.574
Oh, no!

47:21.926 --> 47:23.275
Sebastian!

47:23.275 --> 47:24.885
No, no.
Okay, don't... TIGGER: No!

47:24.885 --> 47:26.060
- Stay down!
- No, no. No.

47:26.060 --> 47:27.801
Stay down.
Stay down.
No!

47:27.801 --> 47:29.020
- Okay. Okay.
- God!

47:29.020 --> 47:30.760
All right,
that is not appropriate.

47:30.760 --> 47:33.154
I'm going to be sick.
No, it's...

47:33.154 --> 47:35.287
Honey, my mom
can't unsee that.

47:37.289 --> 47:39.378
Hey, Sea Bass!
Say hi to TikTok.

47:45.819 --> 47:47.038
Dad, what
the hell you doing?

47:47.038 --> 47:48.430
Packing.

47:48.430 --> 47:50.476
I'm going back
to Chicago
tomorrow morning.

47:50.476 --> 47:52.173
What, are you crazy?
We're not leaving.

47:52.173 --> 47:53.740
You didn't even
give me the ring yet.

47:53.740 --> 47:55.873
Trust me.
What I saw today,

47:55.873 --> 47:57.657
you don't come back from.

47:57.657 --> 47:59.311
Oh, stop being
so dramatic.

47:59.311 --> 48:00.747
It was from far away.

48:00.747 --> 48:01.966
Nobody saw much.

48:01.966 --> 48:03.402
Yeah, that's for sure.

48:03.402 --> 48:05.230
Look, I know
I haven't seen
you naked

48:05.230 --> 48:07.101
since the delivery room,
but is it possible

48:07.101 --> 48:09.364
your <i>pisellino</i> hasn't
even grown since then?

48:09.364 --> 48:11.062
Would you put
the suitcase away?

48:11.062 --> 48:12.672
No, I'm gonna
bring you home,

48:12.672 --> 48:14.152
set you up
with some
Italian girls,

48:14.152 --> 48:15.544
help you
start over fresh.

48:15.544 --> 48:17.633
And I even got
a nice new
hairstyle for you.

48:17.633 --> 48:19.592
Dad, I'm in love with Ellie.
That wouldn't change

48:19.592 --> 48:22.029
if I accidentally showed
my balls to the entire world.

48:22.029 --> 48:23.770
Oh, is that what
you got planned
for tomorrow?

48:23.770 --> 48:25.598
Son, you gotta
stop pretending

48:25.598 --> 48:27.861
that you fit in
with these people,
because you don't.

48:27.861 --> 48:29.471
I'm not pretending.

48:29.471 --> 48:31.256
Are you serious?
I mean, every time
you're with this family,

48:31.256 --> 48:32.431
you make a fool of yourself.

48:32.431 --> 48:33.911
Because you raised me

48:33.911 --> 48:36.087
to be afraid
of trying anything new.

48:36.087 --> 48:38.045
I mean, God.
Dad, listen,

48:38.045 --> 48:40.787
I honestly...
I was nervous
to bring you here.

48:40.787 --> 48:42.310
'Cause I knew
you would just
sit here,

48:42.310 --> 48:44.182
and judge
with your black shirt,

48:44.182 --> 48:45.313
your zipper purse,

48:45.313 --> 48:46.749
your resting bitch face.

48:46.749 --> 48:48.577
Hey, I don't have
resting bitch face.

48:48.577 --> 48:50.579
We look like
Italian gargoyles.

48:50.579 --> 48:51.841
You look
like you're
gonna murder

48:51.841 --> 48:53.974
the entire neighborhood.

48:53.974 --> 48:55.715
You know what
your problem is?

48:55.715 --> 48:58.326
You're so negative,
you can't let yourself
enjoy anything,

48:58.326 --> 48:59.849
so you think I can't either.

49:00.894 --> 49:04.202
Dad, Ellie is my future.

49:04.202 --> 49:07.640
And I'm gonna keep
an open mind
about everything.

49:07.640 --> 49:09.903
Whoa, whoa. What do
you mean, everything?

49:09.903 --> 49:12.123
- Even the job offer?
- Maybe.

49:12.123 --> 49:13.167
It's a pretty good one.

49:15.604 --> 49:16.692
Unbelievable.

49:17.389 --> 49:18.390
Unbelievable.

49:20.218 --> 49:21.349
Unbelievable.

49:25.658 --> 49:27.616
First, your mother is
taken away from me.

49:27.616 --> 49:29.444
Now you wanna leave.

49:29.444 --> 49:31.925
I'm not leaving you, Dad.

49:31.925 --> 49:34.667
Ellie's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

49:34.667 --> 49:36.669
And when
I get married, not if,

49:36.669 --> 49:40.499
her family is going to be
a big part of the package.

49:40.499 --> 49:43.371
Now, I want you
to be a part of my life.

49:43.371 --> 49:45.678
But if that's gonna happen,
you gotta give me some effort.

49:45.678 --> 49:49.203
I wanna see
the Salvo at the salon

49:49.203 --> 49:51.379
that everybody loves.

49:51.379 --> 49:52.772
And if I don't,
I got no choice

49:52.772 --> 49:54.208
but to leave you behind.

49:59.605 --> 50:02.434
I don't know.
How can you say that?
How can you say that?

50:02.434 --> 50:05.741
How could you say that
to your father?

50:07.526 --> 50:10.137
You got no respect
for your family.

50:10.137 --> 50:12.748
I got enough respect to know
we could go to bed angry

50:14.228 --> 50:16.752
but not stinky.
Come on.

50:18.711 --> 50:20.495
Now, come on,
let's do our
night spritz.

50:27.807 --> 50:30.679
I miss you, and I wish
you were here for
so many reasons.

50:30.679 --> 50:32.855
So many reasons, just...

50:32.855 --> 50:35.554
For one, just tell me,
am I being an asshole?

50:35.554 --> 50:38.905
Are we really doing
the right thing
for our son?

50:38.905 --> 50:41.647
Just give me
some kind of sign, something.

50:42.082 --> 50:43.431
Please?

50:43.431 --> 50:44.998
Just let me know
what you think.

50:45.825 --> 50:47.609
I... I...

50:47.609 --> 50:49.350
Give me some sign, honey.

51:08.195 --> 51:09.849
I love you.

51:09.849 --> 51:11.242
Hi, Doug.

51:12.591 --> 51:14.419
- Hello.
- What are you doing?

51:14.419 --> 51:16.769
I was just serenading
the peacocks.

51:17.509 --> 51:18.597
Oh.

51:21.556 --> 51:23.428
Would you be
open enough

51:23.428 --> 51:26.257
to doing
a healing session
with me?

51:26.257 --> 51:27.345
A healing session?

51:27.345 --> 51:29.216
It'll be
very beneficial for you.

51:31.218 --> 51:32.350
Well, that's a nice offer,

51:32.350 --> 51:33.742
but I don't know
if I even know

51:33.742 --> 51:35.004
what you're talking about.

51:35.004 --> 51:38.225
Well, just start
by shutting your eyes,

51:39.096 --> 51:40.793
and then, really,
just focus

51:40.793 --> 51:42.447
on your breathing.

51:42.447 --> 51:43.578
In your nose.

51:44.362 --> 51:45.450
Out your nose.

51:46.364 --> 51:48.888
And if you can,

51:48.888 --> 51:52.674
really try to connect
to that little Salvo,

51:52.674 --> 51:54.981
that was afraid
when you were young.

51:56.243 --> 51:58.245
I don't even know
where he is anymore.

51:58.245 --> 52:00.160
That's so long ago.

52:00.160 --> 52:02.423
You know, I'm in another...
I'm in another life.

52:04.512 --> 52:07.254
Let me help you
find him, okay?

52:07.254 --> 52:08.777
Just stay with your breath.

52:16.524 --> 52:18.831
- Heal, little Salvo.
- Okay, I feel better.

52:20.398 --> 52:21.747
- You do?
- Mmm-hmm.

52:21.747 --> 52:23.096
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Okay.

52:23.096 --> 52:24.880
I'm gonna
go to sleep. Okay.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.012
- Thank you.
- Good night.

52:26.012 --> 52:27.666
Good night.
Good night, Doug.

52:27.666 --> 52:29.146
I'm glad
I could help.
Thank you. Yeah.

52:29.146 --> 52:31.452
Thank you.
Big help.

52:33.324 --> 52:35.543
<i>Yesterday was
a day of regrettable firsts.</i>

52:36.414 --> 52:37.806
<i>I yelled at my father</i>

52:37.806 --> 52:40.983
<i>and I showed my balls
to my future in-laws.</i>

52:40.983 --> 52:42.071
<i>But who knows?</i>

52:42.071 --> 52:44.030
<i>Maybe everybody forgot?</i>

52:44.030 --> 52:46.859
Well, there's
the big swimmer.

52:46.859 --> 52:48.382
Hey, did you
see the full moon
last night?

52:48.382 --> 52:50.167
Okay. Just... I'm talking about
your butt.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.951
All right.
Ignore him.

52:51.951 --> 52:53.692
His butt cheeks
- are the full moon.
- Yes, I understand.

52:53.692 --> 52:56.216
Um, how you
doing, kiddo?

52:56.216 --> 52:58.175
- I'm all right.
Good.

52:58.175 --> 52:59.915
- Have you seen my dad?
Yes.

52:59.915 --> 53:01.482
He is out
taking a walk

53:01.482 --> 53:02.875
with Ellie, Doug
and Tigger.

53:02.875 --> 53:04.268
- A walk?
Yes, he was...

53:04.268 --> 53:05.617
he was...
Well, here.

53:05.617 --> 53:06.879
- Speak of the devil.
So I says to him...

53:06.879 --> 53:08.924
I says, "Why would I
buy you a skateboard

53:08.924 --> 53:09.969
"when I can build you one?"

53:09.969 --> 53:13.190
Holy Mother of God.

53:13.190 --> 53:14.408
Sleepy head,
I was just
telling 'em

53:14.408 --> 53:15.627
about the time
I gave you
a skateboard

53:15.627 --> 53:16.715
for Christmas.
You remember that?

53:16.715 --> 53:18.195
Ah, I remember
that. Yeah.

53:18.195 --> 53:19.674
What time
did you get up
anyway?

53:19.674 --> 53:21.198
I got up early.
I didn't want
to wake you,

53:21.198 --> 53:22.286
so I snuck out,

53:22.286 --> 53:24.331
did my laundry,
watched TV,

53:24.331 --> 53:26.028
fixed one
of their bannisters,

53:26.028 --> 53:27.465
reorganized
the spice rack.

53:27.465 --> 53:28.553
Then when
the sun came up,

53:28.553 --> 53:30.294
I started making breakfast.

53:30.294 --> 53:32.121
Then I went
for a walk to get
to know the family.

53:32.121 --> 53:33.471
Good people,
these Collins.

53:33.471 --> 53:35.864
Good people.
Even the commie.

53:35.864 --> 53:37.170
Oh, I'm
a socialist.

53:37.170 --> 53:38.650
Well, whatever
you say,
Che Guevara.

53:38.650 --> 53:40.739
Oh, that's funny.

53:42.480 --> 53:44.830
Get over here.

53:44.830 --> 53:46.701
- What the hell's going on?
- What do you mean,
what's going on?

53:46.701 --> 53:48.137
I'm doing what
you asked me to do.

53:48.137 --> 53:49.835
Making an effort,
like you asked.

53:49.835 --> 53:52.229
Okay. No, I appreciate it.
But Jesus, the shorts.

53:52.229 --> 53:53.360
Yeah. So what?

53:53.360 --> 53:54.666
I've never seen
your legs before.

53:54.666 --> 53:56.015
Yeah, you haven't.

53:56.015 --> 53:57.321
That's right.
They're not
too bad.

53:57.321 --> 53:58.844
They look like
pretzel sticks
in socks.

53:58.844 --> 54:00.149
Don't blame me.
This is what

54:00.149 --> 54:01.368
these people
gave me,
you know?

54:01.368 --> 54:04.458
What can I tell you?
I want to join the fun.

54:04.458 --> 54:06.373
And I feel great,
and I can't wait

54:06.373 --> 54:07.809
to see what the
universe suggests

54:07.809 --> 54:09.681
after I opened
my eyes.

54:09.681 --> 54:11.813
We did
a healing session together.

54:11.813 --> 54:14.381
Yeah. Little Salvo's
not afraid anymore.

54:14.381 --> 54:16.427
- Little Salvo?
- Yeah.

54:16.427 --> 54:17.950
I hope
everyone's ready

54:17.950 --> 54:19.691
for Family Fun Day.

54:19.691 --> 54:20.953
I am. I am.

54:20.953 --> 54:22.171
Oh,
what's Family Fun Day?

54:22.171 --> 54:23.477
What?
What, are you dense?

54:23.477 --> 54:25.174
Everything you
need to know
is in the name.

54:25.174 --> 54:26.567
- Duh!
- Duh!

54:26.567 --> 54:28.047
Okay.
<i>Salud!</i>

54:28.047 --> 54:29.309
What the hell
is this?

54:29.309 --> 54:30.441
It's a big
4th of July tradition.

54:30.441 --> 54:32.878
There's relay races,
and croquet,

54:32.878 --> 54:34.140
and face painting,

54:34.140 --> 54:35.533
and a hot dog
eating contest.

54:35.533 --> 54:36.882
It's just a lot of fun.

54:43.062 --> 54:44.281
<i>I know
I'd asked the man</i>

54:44.281 --> 54:45.586
<i>to start making an effort,</i>

54:45.586 --> 54:47.153
<i>but this was crazy.</i>

54:47.153 --> 54:49.590
<i>I felt like
I created a monster.</i>

54:49.590 --> 54:51.723
<i>Except instead
of looking scary,</i>

54:51.723 --> 54:55.117
<i>he was smiling, playing games,</i>

54:55.117 --> 54:57.424
<i>dressing like
the American flag.</i>

54:57.424 --> 54:58.643
All right!

54:58.643 --> 55:00.906
The Maniscalcos.

55:00.906 --> 55:02.995
What's your
angle here?
No angle. I'm happy.

55:02.995 --> 55:04.344
I'm with my family.

55:04.344 --> 55:05.432
Say, "Fireworks."

55:05.432 --> 55:07.304
- Fireworks.
- Chee... Say firework.

55:11.438 --> 55:12.831
It's like bocce with sticks.

55:15.703 --> 55:17.226
All right.
You wanna
take a look?

55:18.619 --> 55:20.229
- Nice.
- Right?

55:20.229 --> 55:22.362
And the winner
of this year's

55:22.362 --> 55:25.757
4th of July
hot dog eating
contest is

55:25.757 --> 55:28.020
Salvo Manisculo!

55:35.810 --> 55:37.421
<i>My father was
having a great time,</i>

55:37.421 --> 55:40.337
<i>and suddenly, I was the one
who was uncomfortable.</i>

55:40.337 --> 55:42.382
<i>I wanted him
to make an effort,</i>

55:42.382 --> 55:44.515
<i>not change
who he was completely.</i>

55:48.432 --> 55:49.607
There he is.

55:49.607 --> 55:51.478
The MVP.

55:51.478 --> 55:53.175
What are you doing?
Checking out
your hardware?

55:53.175 --> 55:55.308
I just figured out
how these people
stay so rich.

55:55.308 --> 55:56.962
They do everything
on the cheap.

55:56.962 --> 55:58.529
Hear that? Plastic.

56:00.052 --> 56:01.227
Huh.

56:01.227 --> 56:03.055
Just enjoy it,
will you, please?

56:03.055 --> 56:05.013
I mean, you kicked
some ass out there today,

56:05.013 --> 56:06.798
and I think these people
are starting to like you.

56:06.798 --> 56:08.713
Yeah. Yeah. Come on.
They're just being polite.

56:08.713 --> 56:09.931
I'm serious.

56:09.931 --> 56:12.978
Bill even has
a signature scent now.

56:12.978 --> 56:15.284
Oh, yeah?
What brand?
He won't divulge.

56:15.284 --> 56:16.851
- He won't divulge?
- Yeah.

56:16.851 --> 56:18.897
- Salvo.
I wanna smell that.

56:18.897 --> 56:20.551
Oh, my God.
I've been looking
all over for you.

56:20.551 --> 56:22.553
Um, so,
my mom just
got invited

56:22.553 --> 56:24.555
to be on MSNBC
in two hours.

56:24.555 --> 56:25.686
- That's great.
- Yes.

56:25.686 --> 56:27.514
Well, it would
be, but Tyler,

56:27.514 --> 56:29.168
well, he's
in Sedona,

56:29.168 --> 56:31.692
and I have
no one to do
my hair.

56:31.692 --> 56:32.954
So we were thinking

56:32.954 --> 56:34.391
maybe you could
help her out.

56:34.391 --> 56:35.870
I mean, that's like
asking Van Gogh

56:35.870 --> 56:37.132
to draw a smiley face.

56:37.132 --> 56:39.526
Yes!
Great!

56:39.526 --> 56:40.745
Mmm.

56:43.138 --> 56:44.662
I'd be lying to you
if I told you

56:44.662 --> 56:47.534
I didn't have my eyes
on your lustrous mane
all weekend.

56:47.534 --> 56:50.232
It's nice to finally get
my hands up in here.

56:50.232 --> 56:52.452
Hmm. I am
very grateful.

56:53.018 --> 56:54.149
Ah.

56:55.716 --> 56:58.066
Are those cigars?

56:58.719 --> 56:59.720
Yeah.

57:01.461 --> 57:02.549
Can I have one?

57:03.115 --> 57:04.464
Oh, boy.

57:04.464 --> 57:06.292
This day just
keeps getting
better and better.

57:06.292 --> 57:07.859
Of course,
you can have one.

57:07.859 --> 57:08.990
Be my guest.

57:11.906 --> 57:12.951
Oh!

57:14.039 --> 57:15.649
Only the best.
Can I have one?

57:15.649 --> 57:16.998
Oh, please
join me.

57:17.608 --> 57:18.609
Okay.

57:22.090 --> 57:23.440
Fine.

57:30.882 --> 57:31.970
Mmm.

57:35.103 --> 57:36.191
You know,
I never met
a woman

57:36.191 --> 57:39.456
who smokes
cigars before.
Yeah?

57:39.456 --> 57:42.023
I got hooked
in the Navy.
Wait a minute.

57:42.023 --> 57:44.461
- You're military?
- Mmm-hmm.

57:44.461 --> 57:46.898
I thought you went to one
of those Ivy places.

57:46.898 --> 57:48.639
I enlisted
after graduation.

57:50.336 --> 57:52.904
I just felt
a duty to
my country.

57:52.904 --> 57:55.123
But mostly, I did it
to piss off my parents.

57:56.560 --> 57:57.517
You?

57:58.170 --> 57:59.388
Army.

57:59.388 --> 58:00.607
Combat?

58:00.607 --> 58:02.130
- Cook.
- Ah!

58:02.914 --> 58:04.306
Well, happy 4th to you.

58:04.306 --> 58:07.092
You, too. <i>Salud.</i>

58:07.092 --> 58:08.876
It's nice to have
another actual vet

58:08.876 --> 58:10.748
out here to celebrate.

58:13.794 --> 58:14.969
Oh!

58:29.462 --> 58:31.029
Hey.

58:31.029 --> 58:32.596
- How's it going?
- I can't hear anything.

58:32.596 --> 58:34.511
So they're either
getting along,

58:34.511 --> 58:37.601
or they're
quietly stabbing
each other.

58:37.601 --> 58:39.472
Listen, I have
great news.

58:39.472 --> 58:41.474
- What's up?
- Okay. So,
that decorator

58:41.474 --> 58:43.824
that bought all my work,
they've already
placed all the pieces.

58:43.824 --> 58:45.522
They can't say where
for privacy reasons,

58:45.522 --> 58:47.698
but it probably means
that they're gonna
want a lot more.

58:47.698 --> 58:49.743
- That's great!
- Isn't it?

58:49.743 --> 58:51.919
Wait. Why is
your voice going up?

58:51.919 --> 58:52.964
Why does your face
look like that?

58:52.964 --> 58:54.835
What's going on?

58:54.835 --> 58:55.923
Listen, babe,

58:55.923 --> 58:58.317
I...

58:58.317 --> 58:59.710
Voila.

59:01.494 --> 59:04.192
Oh, what...
What is this? What...

59:05.454 --> 59:08.327
This isn't at all
what I asked
you to do.

59:08.327 --> 59:11.635
Well, yeah.
You see, I don't
really do requests.

59:11.635 --> 59:13.419
The way I work is,
I look at your face,

59:13.419 --> 59:16.074
I get a sense
of your aura,
who you are,

59:16.074 --> 59:17.858
then I let that
dictate the style

59:17.858 --> 59:19.817
that your personality demands.

59:19.817 --> 59:22.036
I am about
to go on television,

59:22.036 --> 59:24.952
and I just...
I just wanted to
look like myself.

59:24.952 --> 59:26.606
Oh!

59:26.606 --> 59:28.826
Bill,
do I look horrible?

59:29.653 --> 59:31.437
- No, no, no.
No?

59:31.437 --> 59:32.960
It is not
horrible. It's...

59:32.960 --> 59:35.963
- Ellie?
- Um, I just
feel like...

59:35.963 --> 59:38.096
- I don't know what it is.
- Dad, couldn't
you just ditch

59:38.096 --> 59:40.098
the aura crap,
and give her
what she wanted?

59:40.098 --> 59:41.969
Whoa! That's like
asking Caravaggio
to go back in,

59:41.969 --> 59:43.754
and retouch up
the beheading
of Holofernes.

59:43.754 --> 59:44.972
- The what a... Who?
- I don't do that.

59:44.972 --> 59:46.495
Can we, as a family,
please force Doug

59:46.495 --> 59:48.149
to stop wearing
that organic de...

59:48.149 --> 59:50.108
Holy shit, Mom!

59:50.108 --> 59:51.675
Oh.

59:51.675 --> 59:53.198
Why do you have
the exact same
haircut as Salvo?

59:53.198 --> 59:55.287
- That's it.
- Oh, my God.

59:55.287 --> 59:56.418
- I don't think so.
You
guys look like

59:56.418 --> 59:57.898
those weird
boy-girl twins

59:57.898 --> 59:59.030
that, like,
just dress
the same.

59:59.030 --> 01:00:00.814
Salvo, how could
you do this to me?

01:00:00.814 --> 01:00:03.121
Wait, wait, wait.
First of all,
I didn't realize

01:00:03.121 --> 01:00:04.513
I was doing anything.

01:00:04.513 --> 01:00:06.951
I mean, to me,
you look powerful, gorgeous.

01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:10.215
You look,
dare I even
say it, sexy.

01:00:10.215 --> 01:00:11.303
Well, I am
supposed to go

01:00:11.303 --> 01:00:12.870
on TV
in 10 minutes,

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:16.047
and you have made me look
like a bitter old Italian man!

01:00:16.961 --> 01:00:18.876
Everybody,
please, get out.

01:00:18.876 --> 01:00:20.965
Go, go, go,
go, go. Sweetheart.

01:00:20.965 --> 01:00:23.228
Mommy,
maybe you...
Get out!

01:00:23.228 --> 01:00:25.099
<i>With all due
respect, Chris,</i>

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:28.407
<i>the existing policy
has been working
for two decades.</i>

01:00:28.407 --> 01:00:30.452
<i>Why change now?</i>

01:00:30.452 --> 01:00:32.019
Ah, she's kicking ass.

01:00:32.019 --> 01:00:33.630
She's pretty much
talking about you.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.196
Oh, stop being so dramatic.

01:00:35.196 --> 01:00:37.546
<i>You don't
just make
major decisions</i>

01:00:37.546 --> 01:00:39.723
based on instincts.

01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:41.072
You've gotta listen

01:00:41.072 --> 01:00:42.421
to the people
you're servicing,

01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:45.206
or someone's
gonna end
up dead.

01:00:45.206 --> 01:00:46.860
<i>All right.</i>
Yeah. Well, okay.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.079
Maybe you got a point.
<i>Uh,
Senator MacArthur,</i>

01:00:48.079 --> 01:00:49.863
I'm actually...
I'm very sorry...

01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:52.126
Sorry to cut
you short.
"Cut me short"?

01:00:52.126 --> 01:00:54.085
Did you say
"cut me short"?

01:00:54.085 --> 01:00:57.175
Is that some kind
of sick joke,
Chris, huh?

01:00:58.263 --> 01:00:59.873
Uh, as you can see,

01:00:59.873 --> 01:01:01.527
uh, very
strong feelings,

01:01:01.527 --> 01:01:03.616
uh, coming out of this story.

01:01:03.616 --> 01:01:05.966
We're gonna continue to follow
its developments for you.

01:01:05.966 --> 01:01:08.229
Listen, when this is all over,
you better apologize.

01:01:08.229 --> 01:01:09.666
Apologize?
For what?

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.102
For what?
She wanted
a touch up.

01:01:11.102 --> 01:01:12.364
You made her look
like David Bowie.

01:01:12.364 --> 01:01:14.235
What? Are you
kidding me?
I gave her a 'do

01:01:14.235 --> 01:01:15.715
that was very
age appropriate

01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:18.326
and dignified.
She should
be thanking me.

01:01:18.326 --> 01:01:19.806
I wouldn't hold
my breath, Salvo.

01:01:19.806 --> 01:01:21.112
Oh, is she really pissed off?

01:01:21.547 --> 01:01:22.853
When I left,

01:01:22.853 --> 01:01:24.768
she was googling
homemade poisons.

01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:26.378
I don't know
if it was for Salvo
or for herself.

01:01:26.378 --> 01:01:28.032
- Oh.
- I don't get it.

01:01:28.032 --> 01:01:30.469
Most women would be honored
to have their hair done

01:01:30.469 --> 01:01:33.733
by East Chicago's three-time
Hair Stylist of the Year.

01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:35.387
That was in the 80's.

01:01:35.387 --> 01:01:37.258
The 80's. So what?
That's the golden age
of hair.

01:01:41.045 --> 01:01:42.960
Hi, Mom.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.483
Would you go
talk to her?
Say something?

01:01:44.483 --> 01:01:45.614
What am
I going to say?

01:01:45.614 --> 01:01:47.138
Just say something,
all right?

01:01:47.921 --> 01:01:49.270
Hey, uh, Tig.

01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:51.142
Tig? Uh...

01:01:51.142 --> 01:01:53.622
Tigger. Tigger,
I just want

01:01:53.622 --> 01:01:55.233
to say
you looked
so good

01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:56.625
up there
on the box.

01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:58.802
Really, really.
Very, very dignified.

01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:00.107
"On the box?"

01:02:00.107 --> 01:02:03.545
Get on your feet,
and go over there.

01:02:03.545 --> 01:02:05.025
- All right?
- All right.

01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:06.592
Uh, Tig, uh...

01:02:07.332 --> 01:02:08.986
I just wanna...

01:02:10.074 --> 01:02:11.858
tell you I'm sorry

01:02:11.858 --> 01:02:14.861
for giving you
a very high-quality hairdo

01:02:14.861 --> 01:02:16.297
without your permission.

01:02:17.429 --> 01:02:19.344
I heard the word "sorry."

01:02:19.344 --> 01:02:21.302
But then you followed it up

01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:23.870
with a compliment
to yourself.

01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:25.785
Well, if I'm being
honest, I never
gave that style

01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:27.874
to anybody else before.

01:02:27.874 --> 01:02:29.354
So I really think

01:02:29.354 --> 01:02:30.834
your aura commands
the respect

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:32.661
that I typically
only reserve for myself.

01:02:32.661 --> 01:02:35.795
So I am sorry
that I, you know,

01:02:35.795 --> 01:02:38.015
didn't do exactly
what you asked for.

01:02:38.711 --> 01:02:39.756
Thanks.

01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:50.679
You know?
Hey, you know what?

01:02:50.679 --> 01:02:52.769
Let... Let me make

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.553
an offer. I would
love to make

01:02:54.553 --> 01:02:57.904
a full Italian dinner
for everybody.

01:02:57.904 --> 01:02:59.210
- That sounds so nice.
- How about that?

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:00.602
And also
as a thank you,

01:03:00.602 --> 01:03:02.300
and with great appreciation,

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.868
for letting us stay
in this beautiful home.

01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:06.434
That won't be necessary.

01:03:06.434 --> 01:03:08.306
We don't keep
a lot of food here

01:03:08.306 --> 01:03:10.787
and the markets are
closed for the holiday.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.136
Don't worry.

01:03:12.136 --> 01:03:14.007
A Maniscalco
always finds a way

01:03:14.007 --> 01:03:15.443
to feed
his family, right?

01:03:15.443 --> 01:03:17.010
Yep. You got it.

01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:18.620
I think it's
a wonderful idea.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.492
I mean, if you look
like an Italian man,

01:03:20.492 --> 01:03:22.320
why not eat like one,
huh?

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.148
No, I mean,
if you...
I meant Italian...

01:03:24.148 --> 01:03:25.802
Shut up, Bill.

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:28.413
I'll be sleeping
on the couch tonight.

01:03:35.289 --> 01:03:36.421
<i>Everybody likes to talk</i>

01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:38.902
<i>about how bad
social media is.</i>

01:03:44.168 --> 01:03:45.343
<i>But in this case,</i>

01:03:45.343 --> 01:03:47.998
<i>it really worked out
for my dad.</i>

01:03:47.998 --> 01:03:50.609
Senator Tigger MacArthur
is going viral today,

01:03:50.609 --> 01:03:53.264
and for the first time,
for all the right reasons.

01:03:53.264 --> 01:03:55.440
<i>This new haircut
is giving me like...</i>

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.224
G.I. Jane two months
out of boot camp.

01:03:57.224 --> 01:03:58.835
<i>It's giving me
gender fluidity.</i>

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.706
It's giving me fresh,
hot, gorgeous.

01:04:00.706 --> 01:04:01.968
Whoever did that haircut,

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:06.233
America thanks you. Ah!

01:04:06.233 --> 01:04:08.975
<i>Now that
Tigger's approval rating
was through the roof,</i>

01:04:08.975 --> 01:04:11.891
<i>she was happy to let
my dad back under hers.</i>

01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:15.286
So good.
So, this is delicious.

01:04:15.286 --> 01:04:16.940
I can't believe

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.202
that you put
this all together

01:04:18.202 --> 01:04:19.943
from what we have
in the kitchen.

01:04:19.943 --> 01:04:22.162
My guess is he raided
the kitchen over at The Shack.

01:04:22.162 --> 01:04:24.077
So, you might wanna call

01:04:24.077 --> 01:04:26.166
Gloria over there,
see if you got
some inventory.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.299
Mmm, mmm.

01:04:28.299 --> 01:04:29.822
What do you call
this again, Salvo?

01:04:35.523 --> 01:04:36.829
It is delicious.

01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:38.700
I'm going for seconds.
Don't tell my trainer.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.486
It's really good.
I just wish you hadn't used
my bowls.

01:04:41.486 --> 01:04:43.618
Well, you know,
I used your bowls, Doug,

01:04:43.618 --> 01:04:46.186
because I wanted
to add a special

01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:49.711
spiritual reverberation
to the meal.

01:04:49.711 --> 01:04:52.018
So, that's why,
- you know?
- Okay.

01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:53.846
- Yeah.
- So, thank you

01:04:53.846 --> 01:04:55.369
for that
- contribution.
- Okay.

01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:57.458
Salvo, it's delicious.
Delicious.

01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:59.199
Listen, given everything
you're doing for my son,

01:04:59.199 --> 01:05:00.809
this is the least
I can do. Oh.

01:05:00.809 --> 01:05:03.638
And I just wanna
say something that

01:05:04.422 --> 01:05:05.771
my father used to say.

01:05:09.731 --> 01:05:10.994
The translation is,

01:05:10.994 --> 01:05:12.996
"The family isn't
just one important thing,

01:05:12.996 --> 01:05:14.780
"it's everything."

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.913
And I like
to toast to that.
Lovely.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.827
<i>Salud!</i>
<i>Salud!</i>

01:05:18.827 --> 01:05:20.917
To everything. <i>Salud.</i>

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.527
- Cheers, everybody.
Well said.

01:05:22.527 --> 01:05:23.832
Watch it, watch it.

01:05:23.832 --> 01:05:25.312
Oh, collision!

01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:27.010
Cut him off.
- Time for some
more vino, huh?

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:29.055
Oh, yes.
- When in Rome.

01:05:29.055 --> 01:05:30.143
Because,
you know,

01:05:30.143 --> 01:05:31.362
you guys
are Italian.

01:05:33.799 --> 01:05:36.367
You got a problem
- with Italians, Bill?
- Yeah, Bill.

01:05:41.546 --> 01:05:44.244
Who got you?
Come on, Bill!

01:05:44.244 --> 01:05:45.985
I thought he was
serious.

01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:58.955
What's this?

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.260
You know, just...

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.870
...the sexiest way
I can think of

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.133
to say thank you.

01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:04.351
Here? Are you
kidding me?

01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:05.831
They're in
the next room.

01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:07.876
You know
I'm a screamer.
I know.

01:06:07.876 --> 01:06:09.052
Just come
over here.

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:14.405
Oh! Oh, yeah.

01:06:20.063 --> 01:06:21.586
Hmm?

01:06:23.892 --> 01:06:25.459
What, baby? What?
- Oh, we got
to go inside.

01:06:25.459 --> 01:06:27.809
- I'm getting eaten alive.
- What? What are
you talking about?

01:06:27.809 --> 01:06:28.985
- I saw a raccoon.
- Is that a safe word?

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:29.942
There's raccoons everywhere.
Raccoon?

01:06:29.942 --> 01:06:31.726
- Yeah.
- Where? What raccoon?

01:06:31.726 --> 01:06:33.685
There's
- some wildlife.
- Honey, there's no raccoons.

01:06:33.685 --> 01:06:35.208
Mmm.

01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:37.776
<i>Seeing
my future in-laws eat</i>

01:06:37.776 --> 01:06:41.519
<i>their family pet is
is as close to an acid trip</i>

01:06:41.519 --> 01:06:43.260
<i>as I ever wanna be.</i>

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.826
Here comes the airplane.

01:06:46.567 --> 01:06:48.482
Ah, no!

01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:51.050
This Italian food's
going to my head.

01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:03.758
<i>This was proof
the man was diabolical.</i>

01:07:03.758 --> 01:07:05.717
I murdered Sergeant Feathers.

01:07:12.419 --> 01:07:14.639
I can't believe

01:07:14.639 --> 01:07:15.770
you fed 'em
a peacock.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:17.424
How could
you do this?
Easy.

01:07:17.424 --> 01:07:19.687
My recipe called for chicken.
All the stores were closed.

01:07:19.687 --> 01:07:21.863
So what does a great chef do?
He improvises.

01:07:21.863 --> 01:07:23.648
By murdering
their beloved mascot?

01:07:23.648 --> 01:07:25.867
They still got
three left. Are
you kidding me?

01:07:25.867 --> 01:07:27.391
Where we come from,
it's called,

01:07:27.391 --> 01:07:28.740
"You gotta do what you gotta
do to feed the family."

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.524
It's called
the peasant mentality.

01:07:30.524 --> 01:07:31.743
Look around, Dad.

01:07:31.743 --> 01:07:32.787
These people
aren't peasants.

01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:34.006
And you thought
I was crazy

01:07:34.006 --> 01:07:35.312
for worrying
that you were gonna

01:07:35.312 --> 01:07:37.923
make us look like
some bad Italian stereotype?

01:07:37.923 --> 01:07:39.794
Come on. You know
I'm not doing that.

01:07:39.794 --> 01:07:41.535
Are you blind? Look at...

01:07:41.535 --> 01:07:43.015
We are
in the woods

01:07:43.015 --> 01:07:44.408
in the middle
of the night

01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:46.888
trying to get rid
of a freakin' body.

01:07:46.888 --> 01:07:48.020
That's right.

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.804
To help me get
rid of the evidence.

01:07:49.804 --> 01:07:51.589
Why does it seem like
you've done this before?

01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:55.593
- Stupid bird!
- It's dead!

01:07:55.593 --> 01:07:56.768
What are
you doing?

01:07:56.768 --> 01:07:58.117
Look at
its feathers.

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:06.038
Night cologne?

01:08:16.222 --> 01:08:18.442
Listen, son,

01:08:18.442 --> 01:08:21.271
I was just trying
to help you win
this family over

01:08:21.271 --> 01:08:23.751
by making
a good meal,
that's all.

01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:25.057
Well, if this is
your idea of help,

01:08:25.057 --> 01:08:26.276
I think I'm good, Dad.

01:08:26.754 --> 01:08:28.756
Jesus.

01:08:28.756 --> 01:08:29.888
Why do I feel
like you're trying

01:08:29.888 --> 01:08:31.368
to wreck this
for me?
Wreck it?

01:08:31.368 --> 01:08:33.544
I'm just making an effort
like you asked me to do.

01:08:33.544 --> 01:08:34.806
Well, it turns out
the only thing worse

01:08:34.806 --> 01:08:37.417
than you not trying
is you trying.

01:08:37.417 --> 01:08:39.680
Well, maybe to you,
but to me, these people,

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.334
they seem
to like me.
Like you?

01:08:41.334 --> 01:08:43.684
If I told these people
the truth about what happened,

01:08:43.684 --> 01:08:44.903
they'd never
have us back here.

01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:51.649
You know, why did
I let Ellie convince me
to bring you here?

01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:53.085
What do you mean,
"bring me here"?

01:08:53.085 --> 01:08:54.695
You're the one
who invited me,
didn't you?

01:08:54.695 --> 01:08:57.002
Yeah, I invited you
to get grandma's ring.

01:08:57.002 --> 01:08:59.396
I didn't know you were
gonna spend the whole time
sabotaging me.

01:08:59.396 --> 01:09:01.006
What are you
talking about,
"sabotaging"?

01:09:01.006 --> 01:09:02.442
How could you say that?

01:09:02.442 --> 01:09:03.965
Everything I'm
doing for you,

01:09:03.965 --> 01:09:06.229
that I've ever done
for you is for
your own good,

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:07.839
to give you
a better life.

01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:09.667
You love to say that,
but now that
I'm gonna get it,

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:11.277
it's like you're
trying to stop it.

01:09:11.277 --> 01:09:13.105
Trying to
stop what?

01:09:13.105 --> 01:09:14.541
I'm trying to make sure
that you don't make
an ass out of yourself

01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:16.021
by trying to be
somebody you're not.

01:09:16.021 --> 01:09:17.196
You're your own person.

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:18.719
You're your own man.
Be your own man.

01:09:18.719 --> 01:09:20.591
Otherwise,
it's embarrassing.

01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:22.070
Oh, man.
You know what?

01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:24.029
This is your problem.
You're so focused

01:09:24.029 --> 01:09:26.423
on other people
being embarrassed,

01:09:26.423 --> 01:09:29.382
you can't see who
the most embarrassing
person is.

01:09:29.382 --> 01:09:30.514
It's you.

01:09:32.124 --> 01:09:34.126
That's really
what you think?

01:09:38.043 --> 01:09:39.740
Let's just go
to sleep,
all right?

01:10:15.733 --> 01:10:18.823
<i>The next morning,
it was the 4th of July,</i>

01:10:18.823 --> 01:10:20.172
<i>which made sense,
'cause I was</i>

01:10:20.172 --> 01:10:22.914
<i>finally getting
my independence.</i>

01:10:22.914 --> 01:10:25.395
<i>It was an amazing feeling.</i>

01:10:25.395 --> 01:10:28.006
<i>But much like
my signature scent,</i>

01:10:28.006 --> 01:10:29.529
<i>it was a little bittersweet.</i>

01:10:31.575 --> 01:10:33.751
<i>But this was
the beginning of my new life.</i>

01:10:34.708 --> 01:10:37.015
<i>And now that I had the ring,</i>

01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:38.712
<i>it was time to make my move.</i>

01:10:44.892 --> 01:10:46.459
I've given this
a lot of thought

01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:48.113
over the last
few days,

01:10:48.113 --> 01:10:50.376
and on top
of accepting

01:10:50.376 --> 01:10:52.509
your very generous offer

01:10:52.509 --> 01:10:55.207
to run the Barrymore Hotel,

01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:58.210
I would also like
to ask your permission

01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:00.343
to propose to Ellie.

01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:04.085
Oh.

01:11:04.085 --> 01:11:06.087
Ah, that doesn't...

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:08.655
I...

01:11:11.005 --> 01:11:13.007
We're kidding!

01:11:14.835 --> 01:11:16.663
- We got him.
- Ho! You
should've seen

01:11:16.663 --> 01:11:19.492
the look
on your face. Priceless.

01:11:19.492 --> 01:11:21.233
Our answer is
an emphatic...

01:11:21.233 --> 01:11:23.104
Yes!
- Oh, God.

01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:25.803
Gee, Sebastian,
we just love you.

01:11:25.803 --> 01:11:27.370
And we just...
We cannot

01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:29.067
wait for you
and Ellie

01:11:29.067 --> 01:11:30.764
to join the party
in D.C.

01:11:30.764 --> 01:11:33.201
Yes.
And this is perfect.

01:11:33.201 --> 01:11:36.204
We're doing our family
Christmas card photo today.

01:11:36.204 --> 01:11:38.598
You can propose there,
and then be in it!

01:11:38.598 --> 01:11:41.688
Oh, thank God.
I was so nervous

01:11:41.688 --> 01:11:43.908
how you guys would react
to this, you know?

01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:46.302
Especially, what's happened
this weekend with my father.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:49.305
No. That dinner
was wonderful.

01:11:52.612 --> 01:11:54.527
-  Yeah.
- Fantastic. Memorable.

01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:56.268
Chicken <i>al cavone.</i>

01:11:56.268 --> 01:11:58.357
Fantastic.

01:11:58.357 --> 01:11:59.489
- Never had it.
Terrific.

01:11:59.489 --> 01:12:00.925
Yes.
- Don't know what's in it.

01:12:02.448 --> 01:12:04.145
What the hell kind
of elf are you
supposed to be?

01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:07.235
I'm representing
all the holiday traditions.

01:12:07.235 --> 01:12:08.759
Nice.

01:12:08.759 --> 01:12:10.195
You're as plump
as a little partridge.

01:12:10.195 --> 01:12:12.632
Yes.

01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:14.330
Oh, oh.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:15.679
Hey, you fit
right in.

01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:17.028
Uh, I don't know.

01:12:17.028 --> 01:12:18.377
Can I propose first

01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:19.944
and then put on
the tree costume?

01:12:21.162 --> 01:12:22.642
What's
- the difference?
- Oh, E... Ellie.

01:12:22.642 --> 01:12:24.601
Ellie, where's
your costume?
We... We can't

01:12:24.601 --> 01:12:25.819
do this without
our reindeer.

01:12:25.819 --> 01:12:27.386
I'm sorry, but I'm
not gonna be taking

01:12:27.386 --> 01:12:29.257
the photo this year,
because I no longer

01:12:29.257 --> 01:12:30.476
wanna be a part
of this family.

01:12:30.476 --> 01:12:33.000
Also, Sebastian
isn't taking the job,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.828
we are not
moving to D.C.

01:12:34.828 --> 01:12:36.221
and we're not gonna
spend any more time

01:12:36.221 --> 01:12:37.918
with these manipulators.
So, let's go.

01:12:37.918 --> 01:12:39.790
- What happened?
- What's happened?

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:42.488
Dad, what do all
of your hotels
have in common?

01:12:42.488 --> 01:12:44.925
Five-star experience
at a three-star price.

01:12:44.925 --> 01:12:48.059
No. The answer is

01:12:48.059 --> 01:12:49.713
their lobby art.

01:12:49.713 --> 01:12:50.844
- Oh.
- Shall we start

01:12:50.844 --> 01:12:52.280
with the Barrymore
Hotel?
Uh-oh.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.978
- Shall we? Come on.
- No, I don't
need to see...

01:12:53.978 --> 01:12:56.372
Oh, look.
Do you notice
anything familiar

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:57.808
- about the walls?
- Well, no.

01:12:57.808 --> 01:12:59.592
That's
my painting,
isn't it?

01:12:59.592 --> 01:13:01.333
Well,
what's that?
My painting.

01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:02.595
My painting.

01:13:02.595 --> 01:13:04.728
Oh, yeah,
my painting.
All right.

01:13:04.728 --> 01:13:07.078
It was
your dad's idea!

01:13:07.078 --> 01:13:08.471
- Wait. Just wait.
- It was
your dad's idea.

01:13:08.471 --> 01:13:10.081
No. One second here.
It was him.

01:13:10.081 --> 01:13:11.604
I just wanna know
how you found out.

01:13:11.604 --> 01:13:13.171
Sebastian,
did you tell her?

01:13:14.955 --> 01:13:15.956
What?

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.176
You knew
about this?

01:13:19.656 --> 01:13:22.920
Well, no,
I kind of saw...

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.313
I can't believe that
you all did this to me.

01:13:25.313 --> 01:13:27.228
Ellie, we can explain.

01:13:27.228 --> 01:13:28.621
- We can explain.
- No, Mom!

01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:31.450
This whole time
I thought I was
selling my art

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:33.409
to this cool new designer,

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:35.585
when really
my parents
just hired them

01:13:35.585 --> 01:13:36.673
to buy my work.

01:13:36.673 --> 01:13:37.891
No, no, no, darling.

01:13:37.891 --> 01:13:39.240
No, that's
not... No.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.808
Yes. Yes, that is
technically true.

01:13:41.808 --> 01:13:44.115
I thought
I was killing it
in the art world!

01:13:44.115 --> 01:13:46.030
We just wanted you
to get a jump-start

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:47.858
in a really,
really rough business.

01:13:47.858 --> 01:13:49.294
It's so terrible
out there.
You know how rough it is.

01:13:49.294 --> 01:13:50.687
It's what you
always do.
You're always...

01:13:50.687 --> 01:13:51.992
You're just stealing
our lessons.

01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:54.430
You bribe our way
onto sports teams,

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.214
you rewrite
our college essays,

01:13:56.214 --> 01:13:58.129
you hire famous rappers

01:13:58.129 --> 01:13:59.652
to emcee
our birthday parties.

01:13:59.652 --> 01:14:01.175
That was also
- not my idea.
- Okay. So what?

01:14:01.175 --> 01:14:02.525
Now you don't
like Warren G?

01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:03.874
Look, you guys are
great parents.

01:14:03.874 --> 01:14:06.006
Don't let her guilt you
into changing your ways.

01:14:06.006 --> 01:14:07.921
All I have ever wanted
was to feel like

01:14:07.921 --> 01:14:10.271
I was accomplishing
things on my own.

01:14:12.186 --> 01:14:13.666
And I can't believe
that you just didn't

01:14:13.666 --> 01:14:14.798
say something to me.

01:14:16.887 --> 01:14:18.715
Sweetheart, we, um...

01:14:18.715 --> 01:14:21.413
Oh, my gosh.
I told you.
Well, yeah.

01:14:26.287 --> 01:14:27.898
<i>I'd been
so focused on trying</i>

01:14:27.898 --> 01:14:29.943
<i>to please Ellie's family,</i>

01:14:29.943 --> 01:14:32.685
<i>that I lost sight
of what I came here to do.</i>

01:14:32.685 --> 01:14:35.819
<i>I had to find Ellie
and make this right.</i>

01:14:35.819 --> 01:14:38.430
<i>And I knew exactly
where she'd be.</i>

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:39.823
Permission
to approach?

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:00.757
Place could use
a remodel, huh?

01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:08.199
I'm sorry.

01:15:08.199 --> 01:15:09.592
I should've said something.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:11.855
Yeah, you should have.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.381
Is there anything I could do
to make it up to you?

01:15:16.381 --> 01:15:19.732
Just being in this family

01:15:19.732 --> 01:15:21.995
is like bowling
with bumpers.

01:15:21.995 --> 01:15:23.344
It's like,

01:15:23.344 --> 01:15:25.608
no matter what I try to do,

01:15:25.608 --> 01:15:27.174
they're always
setting up rails

01:15:27.174 --> 01:15:28.524
to make sure that I win.

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:31.396
And sometimes,
I just want to free bowl,

01:15:31.396 --> 01:15:32.702
because then,
that way

01:15:32.702 --> 01:15:36.401
if I bowl a strike,
then that's my strike.

01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:38.446
But if I gutter it,
then that's on me too.

01:15:38.446 --> 01:15:39.796
I understand.

01:15:39.796 --> 01:15:42.102
You want to work hard
for your own success.

01:15:42.102 --> 01:15:43.713
Yes.

01:15:43.713 --> 01:15:46.063
Do you remember
when you told me
the story

01:15:46.063 --> 01:15:48.239
about how Salvo taught
you how to swim?

01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:50.850
He dropped me in the middle
of Lake Michigan in November.

01:15:52.852 --> 01:15:54.985
Listen, I know
he's a pain in the ass,

01:15:56.595 --> 01:15:59.598
but he also raised you
to be tough and resourceful.

01:15:59.598 --> 01:16:02.427
And those are two things
I really love about you.

01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:05.735
And I kind of wish
that my parents had

01:16:05.735 --> 01:16:07.258
raised me more like that.

01:16:08.781 --> 01:16:10.087
<i>And that was the moment</i>

01:16:10.087 --> 01:16:13.569
<i>everything finally started
to make sense.</i>

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.701
<i>Here I was,
planning to propose</i>

01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:18.312
<i>to the girl of my dreams,</i>

01:16:18.312 --> 01:16:22.621
<i>and I was gonna do it
without the man who raised me?</i>

01:16:22.621 --> 01:16:25.493
<i>I realized
I had everything I wanted,</i>

01:16:25.493 --> 01:16:27.452
<i>but not what I needed.</i>

01:16:27.452 --> 01:16:28.627
I gotta go
do something first.

01:16:30.194 --> 01:16:31.282
What? What?

01:16:31.282 --> 01:16:32.979
Trust me.
Meet me
at dinner.

01:16:35.547 --> 01:16:37.070
How's he doing
back there?

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.032
Keep going,
- bro, I'm fine.
Okay.

01:16:45.252 --> 01:16:47.428
There it is. That's it.

01:16:47.428 --> 01:16:49.039
I got you, <i>mi hermano.</i>

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:51.737
You go get him.

01:16:54.479 --> 01:16:56.829
Hey, stop!
You can't be out here!

01:16:56.829 --> 01:17:00.050
Sir, you have
to get off the tarmac! Sir!

01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:01.486
Stop the plane.

01:17:15.587 --> 01:17:16.632
Son...

01:17:18.198 --> 01:17:19.635
what are you doing?

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.375
You look like
you swam here.

01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:23.073
I came here
to tell you

01:17:23.073 --> 01:17:24.640
that you're
stubborn,
you're cheap,

01:17:25.292 --> 01:17:26.990
you're obnoxious,

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:28.339
you're severely judgmental...

01:17:28.339 --> 01:17:29.427
Wait, wait.
This is what

01:17:29.427 --> 01:17:30.646
I'm getting off
the plane for?

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:32.256
Dad, but the truth is

01:17:32.256 --> 01:17:35.563
all those quirks are
part of what makes you
the greatest dad

01:17:35.563 --> 01:17:36.913
that I could
ever hope for.

01:17:38.436 --> 01:17:40.264
Okay. Now
I'm listening.

01:17:40.264 --> 01:17:42.222
Now, it ain't
always easy
being your son,

01:17:42.222 --> 01:17:45.704
but the way you raised me
made me the man I am today.

01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:48.315
The same man,
for whatever the reason,

01:17:48.315 --> 01:17:50.056
Ellie seems to love.

01:17:50.056 --> 01:17:52.363
Could never figure
that one out, either,
but you know...

01:17:52.363 --> 01:17:53.451
You got your
grandmother's ring.

01:17:53.451 --> 01:17:54.670
What else
you need
from me?

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:57.150
I need you to be part
of our lives, Dad.

01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:58.499
But you said
I was embarrassing.

01:17:58.499 --> 01:17:59.979
You are.

01:17:59.979 --> 01:18:01.633
You haven't
changed one bit
since I was a kid.

01:18:01.633 --> 01:18:03.635
You know who did?
I changed.

01:18:03.635 --> 01:18:05.376
And I think somewhere
along the way,

01:18:06.159 --> 01:18:07.421
I forgot.

01:18:08.553 --> 01:18:10.207
You're my hero, man.

01:18:12.078 --> 01:18:15.038
- Stop.
- No. You are.

01:18:15.038 --> 01:18:16.779
All the stuff
you sacrifice.

01:18:16.779 --> 01:18:19.216
Everything that's
good in my life,
I owe it to you.

01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:21.958
No. It's... it's...

01:18:21.958 --> 01:18:24.743
It's that good things
happen to good kids.

01:18:24.743 --> 01:18:26.310
You're a good boy.

01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:28.747
It's just that
I've been acting
crazier lately,

01:18:28.747 --> 01:18:30.749
because... I... I...

01:18:30.749 --> 01:18:33.796
I was so poor,
for me to give you
a better life,

01:18:33.796 --> 01:18:35.275
and now that
you're going to have it,

01:18:35.275 --> 01:18:38.104
and I'm afraid that
once you marry Ellie,

01:18:38.104 --> 01:18:40.367
I'm gonna lose
the only family I got.

01:18:40.367 --> 01:18:41.978
Oh, Dad, you're
not gonna lose me.
Don't worry.

01:18:41.978 --> 01:18:43.631
Stop... don't cry, Dad.

01:18:43.631 --> 01:18:45.372
You're going
to make me cry.
Well, I can't help it.

01:18:46.199 --> 01:18:47.984
I love you, man.

01:18:47.984 --> 01:18:49.246
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, kid.

01:18:49.246 --> 01:18:50.421
Love you.

01:18:58.081 --> 01:18:59.996
Are you crying?

01:18:59.996 --> 01:19:01.214
- What?
- Are you crying?

01:19:01.214 --> 01:19:02.650
Hell, no.

01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:05.088
I never cry!

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:16.839
Wow!

01:19:18.188 --> 01:19:20.103
I don't know
why I was
so scared.

01:19:21.582 --> 01:19:23.541
This is really beautiful.
Yeah.

01:19:24.977 --> 01:19:26.283
Oh, my God!
We're going down!

01:19:26.283 --> 01:19:27.719
- Oh, my God!
- I'm just kidding.

01:19:27.719 --> 01:19:29.677
I'm going
to kill you, Luck!

01:19:35.248 --> 01:19:36.684
<i>Ladies
and gentlemen, welcome</i>

01:19:36.684 --> 01:19:38.861
<i>to this year's
4th of July clambake.</i>

01:19:38.861 --> 01:19:40.645
Well, so far,

01:19:40.645 --> 01:19:42.778
a very
pleasant evening.

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:45.084
Mmm-hmm.
- Thank you,
my darling.

01:19:45.084 --> 01:19:46.564
Such a treat.

01:19:46.564 --> 01:19:49.262
Hats off to that
new chef, huh?

01:19:49.262 --> 01:19:52.048
Outstanding.
Of course, you can't
go wrong with lobster.

01:19:52.048 --> 01:19:53.223
Oh, sweetie,

01:19:53.223 --> 01:19:55.094
did you lose
your appetite?

01:19:55.094 --> 01:19:56.095
Do you wanna
buy me one?

01:19:58.706 --> 01:20:00.186
<i>All right,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:20:00.186 --> 01:20:02.232
<i>I hope you brought
your dancing shoes tonight...</i>

01:20:02.232 --> 01:20:03.668
<i>Because...</i>

01:20:03.668 --> 01:20:05.975
<i>Thank you, Mr. Woodrow.
Because we've got a real treat</i>

01:20:05.975 --> 01:20:07.585
<i>for you guys tonight.</i>

01:20:07.585 --> 01:20:10.370
<i>Please welcome, all the way
from Chicago, Illinois,</i>

01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:12.938
<i>Sebastian Maniscalco.</i>

01:20:16.899 --> 01:20:19.597
<i>Ellie Collins,
you asked for this.</i>

01:20:19.597 --> 01:20:21.512
I wonder what
this is about.
I don't know.

01:20:26.082 --> 01:20:27.953
<i>Eleanor Mallory Collins.</i>

01:20:27.953 --> 01:20:29.259
What are you doing?

01:20:30.956 --> 01:20:32.523
<i>Exactly what
I came here to do.</i>

01:20:34.786 --> 01:20:35.961
<i>Now, my father
said something</i>

01:20:35.961 --> 01:20:38.007
<i>really profound
this weekend.</i>

01:20:38.007 --> 01:20:40.705
<i>It's an old
Italian saying,</i>

01:20:42.185 --> 01:20:45.231
<i>"Family isn't
one important thing,</i>

01:20:47.059 --> 01:20:48.147
<i>"it's everything."</i>

01:20:50.106 --> 01:20:52.195
<i>Now, yeah, they could
be embarrassing.</i>

01:20:53.152 --> 01:20:54.327
<i>Smothering.</i>

01:20:54.327 --> 01:20:56.112
<i>Sometimes maybe
express their love</i>

01:20:56.112 --> 01:20:58.723
<i>in ways
that are pretty...</i>
Messed up.

01:20:58.723 --> 01:21:00.159
<i>Exactly.</i>
Yeah.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.511
<i>But at the end
of the day they're...</i>

01:21:04.511 --> 01:21:06.862
<i>they're just trying to do
what's best for us.</i>

01:21:08.167 --> 01:21:09.603
<i>Because they love us.</i>

01:21:12.476 --> 01:21:14.086
<i>Now here,
in this moment,</i>

01:21:14.086 --> 01:21:16.001
<i>in front
of our families...</i>

01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:22.225
Ellie...

01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:24.836
will you marry me?

01:21:26.925 --> 01:21:28.100
- Yes.
Oh.

01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:44.290
<i>And there
you have it, folks.</i>

01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:47.163
<i>An atypical
American love story</i>

01:21:47.163 --> 01:21:50.688
<i>about a man reconnecting
with his hero,</i>

01:21:50.688 --> 01:21:53.560
<i>and two different brands
of immigrant families</i>

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.953
<i>coming together.</i>

01:22:02.221 --> 01:22:03.701
Sebastian,
are you sure

01:22:03.701 --> 01:22:05.529
you won't
reconsider
our offer?

01:22:05.529 --> 01:22:06.922
No, it's
a generous offer.

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:08.445
- Yeah.
- But Ellie
and I decided

01:22:08.445 --> 01:22:10.316
to stay in Chicago
for at least
a few more years.

01:22:10.316 --> 01:22:11.578
Oh!
- Yeah.

01:22:11.578 --> 01:22:13.667
I'm not saying
a word. Heartbreaking.

01:22:13.667 --> 01:22:15.800
Dad, I was thinking
since Sea Bass isn't... Yeah.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.497
gonna take the job,
I thought I could...

01:22:18.237 --> 01:22:19.325
step up.

01:22:20.848 --> 01:22:22.067
No more drugs?

01:22:23.808 --> 01:22:25.679
Prescription?
Mostly mine?

01:22:25.679 --> 01:22:27.116
A dream come true.

01:22:27.116 --> 01:22:29.118
All right.
- Thank you.
- That's my boy, Lucky.

01:22:29.118 --> 01:22:30.728
I'm
running a hotel.

01:22:30.728 --> 01:22:32.425
- Hi.
- Hi, everybody.

01:22:32.425 --> 01:22:34.732
Um, I'd like you to meet
my girlfriend, Michelle.

01:22:34.732 --> 01:22:36.081
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm Ellie.

01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:37.517
Hi.
- She's real.

01:22:38.301 --> 01:22:39.519
That's my sister.

01:22:39.519 --> 01:22:41.391
It's very nice
to meet all of you.

01:22:41.391 --> 01:22:44.524
Did you fly
all the way
from... from...

01:22:44.524 --> 01:22:45.961
Africa....Africa

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:49.138
...to be
with Doug?

01:22:49.138 --> 01:22:51.923
Oh, well,
I love Doug.

01:22:51.923 --> 01:22:53.011
But I'm
actually here

01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:54.360
on a Fulbright scholarship.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.579
She's very smart.

01:22:55.579 --> 01:22:56.928
Very nice.

01:22:56.928 --> 01:22:59.670
Well, we're
just so happy

01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:01.237
to meet you. Lovely.

01:23:01.237 --> 01:23:03.413
Yes. You could sit... Mom. Dad.

01:23:03.413 --> 01:23:04.805
- Yes. Yes.
- Where are
we gonna go?

01:23:04.805 --> 01:23:05.893
- Right this way.
- Yeah, we gotta get

01:23:05.893 --> 01:23:08.113
our picture taken.

01:23:11.464 --> 01:23:14.554
Don't say that I never
did nothing for you.

01:23:21.953 --> 01:23:23.302
Ah.
Oh.

01:23:23.302 --> 01:23:25.087
How would
you two feel

01:23:25.087 --> 01:23:27.002
about having
the wedding

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.873
in our chapel
in D.C.?

01:23:28.873 --> 01:23:30.179
D.C.? No.

01:23:30.179 --> 01:23:31.658
Let's have it
in Sicily.

01:23:31.658 --> 01:23:33.269
Oh, Sicily.
- In my grandfather's
garden.

01:23:33.269 --> 01:23:35.053
That's where
you should... I was thinking like Napa,

01:23:35.053 --> 01:23:37.664
because I found this place
that has a big wine glass.

01:23:37.664 --> 01:23:38.926
And you can do
the whole ceremony

01:23:38.926 --> 01:23:40.058
in the wine glass.

01:23:40.058 --> 01:23:42.017
Duke! Duke! No!

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.844
What do you have
in your mouth?

01:23:43.844 --> 01:23:46.151
Duke murdered
a peacock.
