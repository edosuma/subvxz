04:45.868 --> 04:48.161
What a quiet place!

04:48.579 --> 04:52.249
Indeed yes, very quiet.
Very quiet.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.418
There's your bathroom, Miss.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.177
I see we have the same bathroom.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.848
I think I had better
introduce myself.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.976
I'm Vera Claythorne,
Mrs. Owen's secretary.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.353
Oh. My name is Emily Brent.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.816
Is there anything
you want, Miss?

05:18.359 --> 05:20.986
Well, I'd like to see Mrs. Owen.

05:22.405 --> 05:26.700
I'm Mrs. Owen's new secretary.
I expect you know that.

05:26.951 --> 05:30.037
No Miss, I don't know anything.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.456
Just the list of the
ladies and gentlemen

05:32.540 --> 05:34.041
who are invited for the weekend.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.460
Didn't Mrs. Owen mention me?

05:36.836 --> 05:39.963
I haven't seen Mrs. Owen yet.

05:40.048 --> 05:43.133
We only came here
a few days ago.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.721
This is a large house.
What staff have you here?

05:47.764 --> 05:50.307
Just me and Rogers, Miss.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.243
Does Mr. Owen
know we've arrived?

06:10.328 --> 06:13.580
- He's not here yet, sir.
- Where is Mrs. Owen?

06:13.664 --> 06:15.665
They were delayed
in London, sir.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.585
I got a letter.
They'll be here for dinner.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.712
Eight o'clock, sir.

06:24.967 --> 06:29.221
We tell the story in Ireland,
about the two Englishmen...

06:29.305 --> 06:32.766
who were cast away on a
desert island for 3 years...

06:32.809 --> 06:34.935
and never spoke to each other,

06:35.019 --> 06:37.604
because they hadn't
been introduced.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.022
I'm not English!

06:39.107 --> 06:41.274
My name is Prince
Nikita Starloff.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.026
Call me Nicky.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.529
Well, that breaks
the ice, gentlemen.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.198
I am Judge Quinncannon.

06:48.699 --> 06:53.537
How do you do, sir.
I'm Dr. Armstrong.

06:53.621 --> 06:57.374
My name is Lombard.
Philip Lombard.

06:58.709 --> 07:01.211
I'm General Mandrake.

07:01.295 --> 07:02.963
Sir John Mandrake,
isn't it General?

07:03.047 --> 07:05.715
Some years ago,
I was called in consultation.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.717
Your wife was ill.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.804
My wife is dead, sir!

07:10.888 --> 07:13.557
If you gentlemen will be
good enough to follow me,

07:13.641 --> 07:15.725
I will show you to your rooms.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.482
I'm afraid I didn't
catch your name.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.484
- Blore.
- Blore?

07:24.569 --> 07:29.573
- William Henry Blore.
- Oh, Philip Lombard.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.658
I'm afraid you've
got the wrong bag!

07:31.951 --> 07:34.077
You're very observing,
Mr. Blore.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.747
C.M., Charles Morley.
An old friend of mine.

07:37.832 --> 07:41.084
I like his taste.
I even borrow his clothes.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.808
Oh excuse me, Doctor. I thought
that this was a closet.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.935
It seems we are
sharing a bathroom.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.104
Oh, I didn't know.

08:02.106 --> 08:04.357
The only time I regret
being a bachelor

08:04.442 --> 08:05.942
is when I have to
dress for dinner.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.612
- Ah, let me help you.
- Thank you.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.281
Do you know this part
of the English coast?

08:11.365 --> 08:12.532
No. I can't say I do.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.367
Something magical
about an island.

08:14.452 --> 08:17.329
Yes, they're like
a world of its own.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.873
How would you like to spend
your last days here?

08:19.957 --> 08:23.668
Oh no thanks, I think a
weekend will be enough.

08:24.086 --> 08:27.631
We all build islands
of imagination.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.341
Represents escape.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.134
Half of my patients are sick

08:31.219 --> 08:33.220
because they're trying
to escape reality.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.722
- Well, and what's your answer?
- Oh, I tell them fairytales.

08:36.765 --> 08:39.558
I build them islands of
imagined security.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.647
Don't you believe in
medicine, Doctor?

08:43.731 --> 08:46.233
Do you believe in
justice, Judge?

08:53.741 --> 08:55.909
- Mr. Blore?
- Yes?

08:55.993 --> 08:58.078
The bathroom's yours.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.477
- Do you think they're done?
- Done enough for them.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.646
Ethel.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.524
Don't stand there gawking.
Get 'em up.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.402
Did you wash the
floor this morning?

09:30.486 --> 09:33.280
Do you suppose I have
time for everything?

09:33.364 --> 09:36.408
It's not right to go inviting
a house full of guests.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.869
I'll talk to Mr. Owen
when he comes.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.538
You tell him, we're quitting.

09:41.622 --> 09:45.542
The agency didn't tell us the
house was so big and so lonely.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.461
- You knew it was an island.
- Hmph! With only one house.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.298
Makes me nervous. Here!

09:52.300 --> 09:54.968
What they don't know
won't hurt 'em.

09:55.052 --> 09:58.263
Everyone has to eat a speck
of dirt before they die.

10:05.813 --> 10:10.859
Ladies and Gentlemen,
May I propose a toast...

10:10.985 --> 10:14.571
to our gracious hostess,
Mrs. Owen.

10:15.197 --> 10:18.325
Uh oh, Doctor! I saw you.
You drank water.

10:18.409 --> 10:21.328
- That's bad luck.
- Water never hurt anyone, sir.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.330
Especially in my profession.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.499
Don't forget the
old proverb, doctor.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.668
Never trust a man
who doesn't drink.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.171
Sounds like the Bible.
Great book.

10:31.464 --> 10:36.259
And now I give you our
charming host, Mr. Owen.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.844
Jolly good fellow!

10:37.928 --> 10:42.015
And I hope, sir, that will
conclude all possible toasts.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.142
Tell me, Miss Claythorne,

10:44.185 --> 10:46.436
why do they call this
place Indian Island?

10:46.520 --> 10:48.063
I don't know.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.107
Excuse me, sir, the boatman

10:51.192 --> 10:53.943
told me it's because it's shaped
like the head of an Indian.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.781
Oh, that accounts
for the little Indians!

10:57.865 --> 10:59.032
- Indians!

10:59.116 --> 11:02.702
We must have a toast, sir.
I drink to the Indians.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.121
Each little Indian,
individually.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.875
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Ten little Indians!

11:08.959 --> 11:12.379
Ten little Indians!
It's like the nursery rhyme.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.715
Ten little Indian boys
went out to dine...

11:15.800 --> 11:18.551
one choked his little self
and then there were nine.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.220
Oh poor little fellow.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.889
Here's to him. And what
happened to the others?

11:22.973 --> 11:25.392
Nine little Indian boys
sat up very late...

11:25.476 --> 11:27.811
one overslept himself and
then there were eight.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.062
Then what happened?

11:29.146 --> 11:31.064
You will find the rhymes
on the piano.

11:31.565 --> 11:34.651
Mr. Owen seems to be
fond of little Indians.

11:35.444 --> 11:38.571
(Ten little Indians)

11:39.198 --> 11:43.993
Eight little Indian boys
traveling in Devon.

11:44.078 --> 11:48.331
One said he'd stay right there
and then there were seven.

11:48.416 --> 11:53.586
Seven little Indian boys
chopping up some sticks.

11:53.671 --> 11:59.426
Till one chopped himself in half
and then there were six.

12:02.430 --> 12:07.350
Six little Indian boys
playing with a hive.

12:07.435 --> 12:11.771
A bumblebee stung one of
them and then there were five.

12:11.856 --> 12:16.609
Five little Indian boys
going in for law.

12:16.694 --> 12:22.282
Now one got in Chancery
and then there were four.

12:25.244 --> 12:30.039
Four little Indian boys
going out to sea.

12:30.124 --> 12:34.627
A red herring swallowed one
and then there were three.

12:34.712 --> 12:39.716
Three little Indian boys
walking in the zoo.

12:39.800 --> 12:45.889
A big bear hugged one
and then there were two.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.141
The place for nursery rhymes
is in the nursery.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.977
Don't worry judge,
he's down to the last Indian.

12:51.061 --> 12:54.481
Two Little Indian boys
sitting in the sun.

12:54.565 --> 12:59.402
One got all frizzled up
and then there was one.

12:59.487 --> 13:06.075
One little Indian boy
left all alone.

13:08.078 --> 13:13.249
So he went and hanged himself

13:13.334 --> 13:15.335
and then...

13:15.836 --> 13:17.837
there...

13:18.339 --> 13:22.675
were none.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.684
Silence please,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.437
This is your host
Mr. Owen speaking.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.357
You are charged with
the following crimes.

13:37.441 --> 13:40.276
General Sir John Mandrake:

13:40.361 --> 13:43.530
That you did deliberately
send your wife's lover,

13:43.614 --> 13:46.282
Lieutenant Arthur Masefield
to his death.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.951
Emily Brent:

13:48.035 --> 13:50.453
That you did cause and
bring about the death

13:50.538 --> 13:52.539
of your young nephew,
Peter Brent.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.875
Dr. Edward G Armstrong:

13:55.960 --> 13:58.628
That through
uncontrolled drunkenness

13:58.712 --> 14:01.631
you did kill Mrs. Mary Cleese.

14:01.715 --> 14:04.884
Prince Nikita Starloff:

14:04.969 --> 14:07.303
That you are guilty
of the murder

14:07.388 --> 14:09.472
of Fred and Lucy Marlowe.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.225
Vera Claythorne:

14:12.309 --> 14:15.144
That you did murder
your sister's fiancÃ©,

14:15.229 --> 14:16.896
Richard Barclay.

14:16.981 --> 14:21.150
Judge Francis J. Quinncannon:

14:21.235 --> 14:23.820
That you were responsible
for the death

14:23.904 --> 14:26.739
by hanging of one Edward Seaton.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.658
Philip Lombard:

14:28.742 --> 14:31.911
That you are guilty of
the deaths of 21 men,

14:31.996 --> 14:34.080
members of an
East African tribe.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.332
William H Blore:

14:36.417 --> 14:39.002
That by perjuring your testimony

14:39.086 --> 14:41.421
you did bring about the
death of James Landor.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.756
Thomas and Ethel Rogers:

14:43.841 --> 14:45.925
That you brought about the death

14:46.010 --> 14:50.096
of your invalid employer,
Mrs. Jennifer Brady.

14:51.473 --> 14:54.183
Prisoners at the bar of justice

14:54.268 --> 14:58.021
have you anything to
say in your defense?

15:12.161 --> 15:15.622
Silence please, Ladies and
Gentlemen.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.207
This is your host, Mr. Owen.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.545
What's going on here?

15:22.630 --> 15:25.381
What kind of a
practical joke is this?

15:25.466 --> 15:26.966
It's on the record.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.637
An outrageous lie.

15:37.061 --> 15:40.063
It's called Swan Song.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.566
May I ask who put it
on the gramophone?

15:43.651 --> 15:45.485
- I did, sir.
- Why?

15:45.569 --> 15:48.988
I didn't know what it was.
On my oath I didn't know! I...

15:49.239 --> 15:51.991
I was just obeying orders, sir.
That's all.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.577
- Who's orders?
- Mr. Owen's.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.163
Now let's get this quite clear.

15:57.247 --> 16:00.667
Mr. Owen's orders
were what exactly?

16:00.751 --> 16:04.379
To put the record on at
9 o'clock. It was sealed up.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.839
I... I thought it was
just a piece of music.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.092
It's the truth, sir!

16:09.176 --> 16:12.178
I haven't seen Mr. Owen.
I was telling my wife.

16:12.262 --> 16:15.431
I told you we shouldn't have
come here! I want to get away!

16:15.516 --> 16:18.434
- I won't touch that money!
- Shut up!

16:19.061 --> 16:22.271
First thing to do, Rogers,
is to get your wife to bed.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.737
May I have your
attention please.

16:29.863 --> 16:33.866
This letter to Rogers
is signed by Mr. U N Owen.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.620
I must confess I don't
know Mr. Owen personally.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.206
What kind of a man is he?

16:44.628 --> 16:46.295
Who knows him?

16:48.340 --> 16:52.385
Ha ha. You all came to a house
and you don't know the host!

16:52.469 --> 16:54.887
What about yourself,
Your Highness?

16:54.972 --> 16:59.225
Oh, with me, it's different.
I am a professional guest.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.812
I knew we shouldn't
have come here!

17:02.896 --> 17:04.146
Quiet, Ethel!

17:04.231 --> 17:06.648
I knew somebody would
find out about it some day!

17:06.733 --> 17:08.818
- I told you!
- Shut up, I tell you!

17:10.404 --> 17:12.989
She's quite out of
her head, Doctor.

17:14.157 --> 17:19.912
Hysteria induced by shock.
Give her this sedative.

17:19.997 --> 17:23.082
10 drops in half
a glass of water.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.916
Yes, sir.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.336
If she doesn't sleep, repeat
the dose in 2 hours.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.548
Oh, I hope she'll sleep, Doctor.

17:34.219 --> 17:38.431
Dr. Armstrong, we've taken all
the evidence except your own.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.850
What's your reason
for being here?

17:40.934 --> 17:43.770
Quite frankly, I came
here professionally.

17:44.354 --> 17:47.774
I received a letter from
Mr. Owen, asking me to come here

17:47.858 --> 17:50.109
and spend the weekend
and pretend to be a guest

17:50.194 --> 17:53.780
so that I might examine his wife
who had refused to see a doctor.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.199
I'll summarize our findings.

17:56.325 --> 18:00.620
We've all received letters
from old trusted friends.

18:00.704 --> 18:03.956
Inviting us to spend
the weekend here.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.375
As guests of their
friends, the Owens.

18:06.877 --> 18:10.213
Miss Claythorne was
employed through an agency

18:10.297 --> 18:11.964
and told to report to Mrs. Owen.

18:12.049 --> 18:15.635
This letter to Mr. Lombard
is the only one directly

18:15.719 --> 18:18.888
from Mr. Owen. Very peculiar.

18:18.972 --> 18:22.308
I might even
call it threatening.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.726
What do you say?

18:23.811 --> 18:26.896
I say that the only person
whose presence here

18:26.980 --> 18:29.232
hasn't been explained
is that gentleman.

18:29.483 --> 18:33.236
Well Your Honor, I see no
reason to conceal it any longer.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.987
I'm here to do a job.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.572
- I was hired.
- By whom?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.157
This man, Owen.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.159
You saw him?

18:40.244 --> 18:42.912
No. He enclosed a fat
money order with that

18:42.996 --> 18:45.414
and someone to
join the house party

18:45.499 --> 18:46.916
and to pose as
one of the guests.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.670
I run a detective agency in
Plymouth! I got me credentials!

18:51.797 --> 18:53.589
Look here, Judge.

18:53.674 --> 18:59.262
All of these letters refer to
our host as U N Owen. U N Owen!

18:59.304 --> 19:01.347
Unknown

19:01.431 --> 19:03.599
Yes, Mr. Unknown has not only

19:03.684 --> 19:06.894
enticed us here under false
pretences but he's taken the

19:06.979 --> 19:09.188
trouble to find out a
great deal about us all.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.274
- That's a lie!
- It's a fantastical idea!

19:13.443 --> 19:17.822
Listen, my friends.
The accusation is true!

19:17.865 --> 19:21.576
Now I remember.
A year ago...

19:21.660 --> 19:23.619
two people in the road...

19:23.704 --> 19:26.706
I was driving fast, fast, fast!

19:26.790 --> 19:30.877
- What happened?
- They took my license away.

19:30.961 --> 19:34.881
- What about the two people?
- I ran over them.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.632
Beastly bad luck.

19:48.312 --> 19:52.148
I'm still not clear as to the
purpose of our unknown host

19:52.232 --> 19:54.734
in getting us to assemble here.
In my opinion,

19:54.818 --> 19:57.320
this person whoever he
may be is not of normal mind.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.155
He may be dangerous.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.531
I think it would be wise

20:00.616 --> 20:01.908
for us all to leave this
island immediately.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.326
I quite agree, sir.

20:03.410 --> 20:06.078
Rogers, how soon can we get
the boat from the mainland?

20:06.163 --> 20:08.164
I can't, sir.
There's no telephone.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.082
The boat only comes
twice a week, sir.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.834
It won't come again
until Monday.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.170
And this is only Friday.

20:14.254 --> 20:17.673
- There's no boats here?
- No, sir.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.675
Why do you want to leave,
my friends?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.261
Why don't we get to the
bottom of this mystery?

20:22.346 --> 20:24.764
It's wonderful! Really!

20:24.848 --> 20:26.682
At our time of life, sir,

20:26.767 --> 20:28.851
we have no desire for
thrills as you call them.

20:28.936 --> 20:32.021
Your legal mind has lost
its taste for adventure.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.690
I am all for crime, Your Honor.

20:34.858 --> 20:40.655
May I propose a toast:
Here is to crime!

20:59.633 --> 21:03.886
How perfectly disgusting!
Drinks like an animal.

21:03.971 --> 21:07.223
- Huh? What did you say?
- He's not moving.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.392
Just plain drunk.

21:12.187 --> 21:14.230
Just plain dead.

21:15.482 --> 21:18.734
- What did the doctor say?
- Dead.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.403
What?

21:45.637 --> 21:47.930
What are you looking at, Rogers?

21:48.598 --> 21:50.599
It's broken, sir.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.351
You'll have more than that

21:52.436 --> 21:54.437
to report to the owner
of this house.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.188
But Mr. Owen isn't
the owner, sir.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.357
He's only leased
it for the weekend.

21:58.442 --> 22:01.694
Ah, then you know
more than you told us.

22:02.237 --> 22:04.280
Come, come, Rogers,

22:04.364 --> 22:06.949
are you quite sure that there
is no one else on this island?

22:07.034 --> 22:10.703
- I'd swear to it, sir.
- I believe you Rogers.

22:10.787 --> 22:14.206
But I'm afraid your story will
be questioned by the police.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.977
Don't touch!

22:37.939 --> 22:40.149
I thought you'd gone
to bed, Mr. Blore.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.401
In our profession,

22:42.486 --> 22:45.654
Doctor, we don't always
do what we appear to do.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.573
Perhaps it the same in yours.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.909
Why don't you want me
To touch that glass?

22:49.993 --> 22:51.786
I thought it would
be inadvisable

22:51.870 --> 22:54.163
for you to have your
fingerprints on it.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.332
Smell it.

23:02.005 --> 23:06.092
- Lethal solution.
- Suicide?

23:07.469 --> 23:10.679
That, I believe comes under
your profession, sir.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.115
Doctor!

23:29.574 --> 23:31.617
Doctor Armstrong!

23:31.701 --> 23:34.036
- Doctor Armstrong!
- What is it, Rogers?

23:34.121 --> 23:36.038
It's the wife, sir.
She doesn't look right to me.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.790
Go ahead I'll follow you.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.473
Good morning, Miss Brent.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.475
I hope you slept
better than I did.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.561
I slept very well, thank you.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.563
I have nothing on my conscience.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.649
Good morning, General.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.318
Good morning.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.738
General Mandrake!

24:10.490 --> 24:16.829
Yes, Juliet?
Oh! Forgive me, young lady.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.915
I was thinking of my wife.

24:20.667 --> 24:23.586
Good morning, Miss Claythorne.
What about breakfast?

24:23.670 --> 24:25.337
Do you mind if I
sit down like this?

24:29.759 --> 24:32.428
Morning, Judge.
Morning, Miss Brent.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.346
Good morning.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.348
What? Is something worrying you?

24:36.433 --> 24:38.184
I don't understand it.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.102
There are a lot of things,
I don't understand, sir!

24:40.187 --> 24:41.687
These little figures.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.272
How many were
there last night? Ten?

24:43.356 --> 24:44.690
- Ten.
- Yes, ten.

24:44.774 --> 24:48.611
Rogers found one broken
after... after what happened.

24:49.279 --> 24:53.282
- And now, how many do you see?
- Eight.

24:53.366 --> 24:56.035
- Only eight.
- That's what I counted.

24:56.536 --> 24:59.121
Oh, let Mr. Owen worry about it.
They're his Indians.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.706
- What about breakfast?
- I afraid

25:00.790 --> 25:02.708
you'll have to go
without breakfast.

25:03.376 --> 25:06.045
Mrs. Rogers died in her sleep.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.379
- What?
- What?

25:07.464 --> 25:09.131
- How?
- Heart failure?

25:09.216 --> 25:11.300
Her heart certainly
failed to beat.

25:11.384 --> 25:13.552
What caused it to fail,
I cannot say.

25:13.637 --> 25:14.887
Conscience?

25:14.971 --> 25:17.139
Oh conscience, my eye.
What about her husband?

25:17.224 --> 25:19.892
He was scared to death,
for fear his wife would talk.

25:20.769 --> 25:24.480
I'm sorry. I'm sorry there's
no breakfast prepared.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.398
But you see, my wife...

25:26.483 --> 25:28.734
- It's all right, Rogers.
- We understand.

25:31.238 --> 25:35.241
But I thought you told us,
he was dead.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.743
- His wife.
- Eh?

25:37.827 --> 25:40.996
- His wife!
- Wife?

25:42.249 --> 25:48.170
No, no, no. I don't think a man
would ever kill his wife.

25:48.922 --> 25:52.341
No matter how guilty she was.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.931
The wicked flee when
no man pursueth.

25:59.015 --> 26:03.519
Two accidental deaths in
12 hours? I don't believe it!

26:03.603 --> 26:06.105
Nor I! What do you say, Judge?

26:06.189 --> 26:09.942
How does the rhyme go,
Miss Claythorne?

26:10.694 --> 26:12.695
Ten Little Indians?

26:12.779 --> 26:16.115
One choked his little self
and then were nine.

26:17.158 --> 26:21.287
- Go on...
- One overslept himself.

26:21.371 --> 26:24.373
And then there were eight.

26:30.171 --> 26:33.465
We are eight people
on this island now.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.400
- Lombard!
- I'll be ready in a minute!

26:51.484 --> 26:53.068
Take your time!

26:54.404 --> 26:56.905
- You know I got it?
- Got what?

26:57.532 --> 27:00.242
There's one thing this
fellow Owen forgot.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.244
This island is just a bare rock.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.163
We'll catch that raving maniac.

27:04.247 --> 27:06.832
He would have to be a fool
to stay on the island.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.001
You mean Rogers is lying?

27:09.085 --> 27:11.378
Why not? The man's scared,

27:11.463 --> 27:13.172
scared out of his senses,
that's obvious.

27:13.256 --> 27:15.174
That's why I think that
he is telling the truth.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.593
A lunatic like Owen could
have found a hiding place

27:17.677 --> 27:19.011
before Rogers arrived here.

27:19.095 --> 27:21.347
It doesn't matter if
Rogers is lying or not.

27:21.431 --> 27:24.683
You agree that Mr. Owen
Esquire is hiding, don't' you.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.436
He'll certainly be dangerous.
We ought to be armed.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.356
Yes, too bad we're not allowed
to carry firearms in England.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.858
It puts the normal citizen
at a great disadvantage.

27:33.026 --> 27:35.527
You mean you
haven't any weapon?

27:35.612 --> 27:37.196
You know Blore, it's strange,

27:37.280 --> 27:39.114
but I came to the same
conclusion you did.

27:39.199 --> 27:42.785
Mr. Owen is hiding,
maybe inside this house.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.787
He appears to have an
accomplice, hasn't he?

27:44.871 --> 27:46.622
If you ask me, Rogers...

27:53.296 --> 27:57.299
I have a feeling I'm
being watched. Secretly.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.335
What do you see?

28:34.838 --> 28:38.215
I... I thought heard
a strange voice.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.343
Gentlemen, I have come
to the conclusion that

28:41.428 --> 28:44.179
the invisible Mr. Owen is hiding
somewhere on this island.

28:44.264 --> 28:48.016
Extraordinary. I was looking for
you to tell you the same thing.

28:48.101 --> 28:50.436
- That's what I think, sir.
- Me too.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.354
We've all come to
the same opinion.

28:52.439 --> 28:55.023
We must find his
place of concealment.

28:55.108 --> 28:57.526
Immediately. So long as
there's a lunatic at large,

28:57.610 --> 28:59.361
we are in mortal danger.

29:15.253 --> 29:16.962
Do you hear that?

29:25.722 --> 29:30.559
Hello, puss. Looking
for a mouse? So are we.

29:30.643 --> 29:35.314
What I'd like to know is whether
we're the cat or the mouse.

29:38.193 --> 29:41.403
Nobody in the General's room,
not even the General.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.113
I wonder where the old boy is.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.991
I don't know. I don't think he
even knows where he is himself.

29:50.663 --> 29:55.417
Nothing in there
but the Russian.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.002
I keep hearing that song

29:57.086 --> 29:59.087
he was singing last night
just before he popped off.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.172
- Ten Little Indians?
- Yes.

30:00.256 --> 30:01.840
It certainly was his swan song.

30:09.265 --> 30:11.850
One thing is certain.
He isn't inside.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.435
Therefore, he must be outside.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.270
- Brilliant thinking, Blore!
- Eh?

30:44.467 --> 30:47.886
I'm afraid it's no use
watching for the boat.

30:48.221 --> 30:50.138
It won't come till Monday.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.391
No boat will ever come, Juliet.

30:52.976 --> 30:57.729
We're here forever.
What made you love him, Juliet?

30:58.314 --> 30:59.731
Sir John!

31:01.568 --> 31:06.905
Oh. Forgive me, my child.
You don't understand.

31:30.096 --> 31:32.598
- Nobody!
- Not a living thing.

31:32.682 --> 31:34.349
Not even a hiding place.

31:38.688 --> 31:41.023
Not even a seagull
could hide down there.

31:41.190 --> 31:44.109
- I don't understand it.
- Maybe we've been wrong.

31:44.193 --> 31:46.194
Building a nightmare
out of imagination.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.530
Two people dead
isn't imagination.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.282
The Russian may have
committed suicide.

31:50.366 --> 31:51.867
And Mrs. Rogers?

31:51.951 --> 31:56.288
Well, you didn't give an
overdose last night, did you?

31:56.372 --> 31:59.541
Doctors can't afford to
make mistakes of that kind.

31:59.626 --> 32:01.877
We cannot blunder as
detectives sometimes do.

32:01.961 --> 32:03.378
It wouldn't be
your first mistake

32:03.463 --> 32:05.797
if that gramophone
record is to be believed.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.467
Gentlemen, gentlemen this
is no time for quarrelling.

32:08.551 --> 32:11.720
- Let's face it we're in a trap.
- You shouldn't forget

32:11.804 --> 32:13.639
the ten little Indians
on the dinner table.

32:13.723 --> 32:16.308
That's right. Mr. Owen's
hand is plain to see.

32:16.392 --> 32:20.020
Yes, but where the devil
is Mr. Owen himself?

32:27.612 --> 32:30.489
If Mr. Owen is on this island,
he'll catch his death of cold.

32:30.573 --> 32:33.158
If that's supposed to be a joke,
I don't see the point.

32:33.242 --> 32:35.994
All we have to do is to keep
quiet and we'll hear him sneeze.

32:36.079 --> 32:37.412
Oh.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.751
I'm sorry it's only
cold meat and salad.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.503
I did the best I could.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.254
- Okay, Rogers.
- Oh we understand.

32:46.839 --> 32:51.510
- Rogers we're only seven today.
- I'm sorry miss.

32:52.595 --> 32:54.596
You called General Mandrake?

32:54.681 --> 32:57.432
I looked in his room, Miss,
but he's not there.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.520
- Didn't he come in the house?
- I didn't see him, Doctor.

33:01.604 --> 33:03.855
Last time I saw, he was
mooning around on the beach.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.858
- He seemed quite abnormal.
- I know where he is.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.694
You stay here, Miss Claythorne.

33:12.573 --> 33:17.202
You say the General was
behaving very strangely?

33:17.286 --> 33:21.206
- Like a man out of his mind.
- In other words, a lunatic.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.375
Right ho, the old boy's barmy.

33:23.459 --> 33:26.628
Whom the Gods destroy,
they first make mad.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.133
Well? Aren't we
looking for a lunatic?

33:31.634 --> 33:34.636
He said no boat will ever come.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.722
Then he knows something.

33:37.140 --> 33:40.142
Maybe he's not as crazy
as we think he is.

33:49.944 --> 33:52.487
Doctor, you better come with me.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.073
Don't wait for us.

33:55.324 --> 33:57.659
And don't wait for the
General any longer.

34:05.626 --> 34:08.335
Poisoned glass could
mean suicide.

34:08.588 --> 34:12.049
An overdose of sedative might
have been an accident.

34:12.507 --> 34:15.427
But this instrument,

34:15.511 --> 34:19.097
which you saw me remove from
the back of the third victim

34:19.181 --> 34:23.351
means only one thing: Murder.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.149
Or an act of God.

34:29.484 --> 34:34.196
My dear lady, in my
experience of ill doing,

34:34.280 --> 34:38.074
Providence means the work of
punishment to us mortals.

34:39.118 --> 34:42.954
Evidently, Mr. Owen believes
we are guilty of certain crimes,

34:43.039 --> 34:44.956
which the law cannot touch

34:45.041 --> 34:47.626
and he's appointed himself
to execute justice.

34:47.710 --> 34:50.712
That is why he has
enticed us to this island.

34:50.797 --> 34:53.965
There's no one on this island.
I tell you. No one.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.885
- Doctor. Doctor Armstrong!
- What is it, man?

34:58.763 --> 35:02.474
There's another little
Indian figure missing.

35:03.017 --> 35:06.478
- That accounts for the General.
- I was expecting that.

35:06.729 --> 35:09.815
You just said there's
no one on this island.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.150
In a sense you may know.

35:12.401 --> 35:16.738
Nevertheless, I am now
certain that Mr. Owen is here.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.323
How can he be here?

35:18.407 --> 35:20.575
I don't believe in
the invisible man.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.369
He's not invisible.

35:22.453 --> 35:25.664
Mr. Owen could only come
to this island in one way.

35:25.706 --> 35:27.457
It's perfectly clear.

35:28.167 --> 35:32.671
Mr. Owen is one of us.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.600
Do you have to do that?

36:26.684 --> 36:29.144
I'm just studying
Mr. Owen's little scheme.

36:29.228 --> 36:31.479
Maybe you know how
the General was killed.

36:31.564 --> 36:33.231
My dear Blore, can't you read?

36:33.316 --> 36:35.567
Eight little Indians boys
traveling in Devon,

36:35.651 --> 36:39.237
One said he'd stay there
and then there were seven.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.741
The old soldier
stayed here, didn't he?

36:52.501 --> 36:54.669
Am I disturbing
your little game?

36:54.754 --> 36:55.921
Not at all, Blore.

36:56.005 --> 36:58.506
Nothing clears the mind
like a game of precision.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.091
What game are
you playing, judge?

37:00.176 --> 37:02.594
We've come to the conclusion,
the doctor and I,

37:02.678 --> 37:05.764
that this whole story is
a game of the mind.

37:05.848 --> 37:10.435
There we are. Eight of us
came to this island.

37:11.854 --> 37:13.688
The Rogers were waiting for us.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.774
Don't forget, waiting for us.

37:15.858 --> 37:18.360
One of the ten is Mr. Owen.

37:18.527 --> 37:20.487
We agree on that.

37:20.529 --> 37:24.032
Out of all of us, three persons
are definitely cleared.

37:24.116 --> 37:27.118
- Who?
- The dead ones.

37:27.453 --> 37:33.083
Our Russian friend,
Mrs. Rogers and the General.

37:34.377 --> 37:38.713
- Seven little Indians left.
- Six. One is bogus.

37:38.798 --> 37:42.717
Correct, sir.
One of us is Mr. Owen.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.971
Which one?

37:46.138 --> 37:47.639
Where's your alibi?

37:47.723 --> 37:50.308
I'm not like you Mr. Blore. I am
a well known professional man.

37:50.434 --> 37:53.436
My dear doctor, that
proves less than nothing.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.981
I too am a well known person.

37:56.023 --> 37:58.942
But doctors have
gone mad before now.

37:58.985 --> 38:02.529
Judges have gone mad
and so have policemen.

38:02.613 --> 38:05.907
And, may I say, explorers,
Mr. Lombard?

38:05.992 --> 38:07.325
You may. You may.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.160
Why do you leave
Miss Claythorne out of it?

38:09.245 --> 38:10.996
- We don't.
- Nor you, my dear lady.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.914
Well, I quite appreciate
that nobody can be

38:12.999 --> 38:15.375
- exonerated without proof.
- What about Rogers?

38:15.418 --> 38:18.253
- That's what I was thinking.
- What do we know about him?

38:18.337 --> 38:19.879
He put that record on the
gramophone, didn't he.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.423
That's a fact.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.758
How do we know Rogers
didn't lease this house

38:23.843 --> 38:25.510
and pretend to be the butler?

38:25.594 --> 38:28.263
Oh, no, no, no.
Bad psychology!

38:28.347 --> 38:30.348
You can rule
Rogers out definitely.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.934
- I don't see why.
- Look at the shape of his head.

38:33.019 --> 38:34.602
He hasn't the brains for it.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.521
And don't forget there's
something else, sir.

38:36.605 --> 38:38.106
My wife was one of the victims.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.526
In my time, Rogers,
I've had several husbands

38:41.610 --> 38:43.778
before me guilty of the
murder of their wives.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.531
Well, if you put it
that way, sir, they...

38:46.615 --> 38:48.616
they do sometimes
drive a man crazy.

38:48.701 --> 38:51.119
We must suspect each
and everyone among us.

38:51.203 --> 38:54.914
Now, I warn everybody to
be on his guard. If not...

38:59.295 --> 39:01.963
We shall all go the same way.

39:03.341 --> 39:09.721
And Mr. Owen will very soon
be alone on this island.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.812
E flat, Miss Claythorne.

39:20.566 --> 39:22.067
Aren't you afraid the others

39:22.151 --> 39:24.277
will think your
playing inappropriate.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.946
I can't stand the silence.
I have to do something.

39:26.989 --> 39:28.323
Go on playing.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.421
If it's any comfort to you,

39:43.506 --> 39:45.757
there's one person who
doesn't suspect you.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.009
Thank you.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.886
Aren't you going to
return the compliment?

39:49.929 --> 39:52.764
I haven't made up my mind
about you, Mr. Lombard.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.017
Whom do you suspect?

39:59.688 --> 40:01.439
The one nearest the fire.

40:06.487 --> 40:09.614
- I think you're wrong.
- Well, who then?

40:09.782 --> 40:12.951
A man who believes
in punishing crimes.

40:13.035 --> 40:16.913
His brain might snap and
he'd want to be executioner.

40:16.956 --> 40:19.207
After having been a judge.

41:08.841 --> 41:11.009
Rogers, I'd like to ask
you a few questions.

41:11.093 --> 41:12.677
Did you...

41:14.513 --> 41:18.516
- prepare a nice dinner?
- Just cold meat, sir.

41:18.601 --> 41:21.978
I see. I'm sure you
do your best, Rogers.

41:23.063 --> 41:26.274
Is there plenty of food
for the weekend?

41:26.817 --> 41:29.777
Oh, yes, sir. Everything
was provided for.

41:29.862 --> 41:33.281
Oh, Mr. Blore, may I
ask you a question?

41:33.365 --> 41:35.533
Of course, of course,
my dear fellow.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.745
How many will you be
for dinner tonight?

41:39.079 --> 41:43.875
But... Oh, I see what
you mean. Yes.

41:59.391 --> 42:02.227
Don't forget your vote, Rogers.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.396
In a case like this, a secret
vote is the only way

42:05.481 --> 42:08.566
to bring out into the open
how we are all thinking.

42:12.821 --> 42:17.450
No, no, no. Never touch it. No.
But under the circumstances.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.751
Now, whom do we suspect
of being Mr. Owen?

42:30.214 --> 42:32.799
Mr. Lombard, one vote.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.678
Mr. Blore, one vote.

42:38.556 --> 42:41.266
Dr. Armstrong, one vote.

42:43.018 --> 42:45.186
Rogers, one vote.

42:47.898 --> 42:50.525
Miss Brent, one vote.

42:53.028 --> 42:57.824
I see I haven't been neglected.
One vote.

42:59.034 --> 43:01.744
Another vote for you.
Rogers. You win.

43:03.414 --> 43:06.541
You mean, sir, that
I am being accused?

43:06.625 --> 43:08.960
Well, it's not
precisely a majority,

43:09.044 --> 43:10.878
but you have the most votes.

43:10.963 --> 43:13.006
They're saying its me,
because I'm only a butler.

43:13.424 --> 43:15.133
You said I didn't have
the brains to do it.

43:15.217 --> 43:17.635
- I didn't vote for you, Rogers.
- Well, who did then?

43:17.928 --> 43:20.972
Who didn't drink the cocktail
you just served?

43:21.015 --> 43:23.558
You think I poisoned
those cocktails?

43:24.852 --> 43:26.728
I'll show you, sir.

43:30.774 --> 43:32.650
Picking on an innocent man!

43:36.488 --> 43:39.073
I can't touch even
a drop of alcohol.

43:42.578 --> 43:44.078
And if that's what
you think of me,

43:44.121 --> 43:45.830
I'm not going to
serve any dinner.

43:45.914 --> 43:47.582
Oh, Rogers, come back here!

43:47.625 --> 43:49.959
You can't do that!

44:03.265 --> 44:05.767
Don't look so offended, Rogers.

44:06.268 --> 44:08.770
If it had been
anybody but you, sir.

44:08.854 --> 44:10.271
I'm sorry, Rogers.

44:10.356 --> 44:12.273
But, how do I know that
you didn't vote for me?

44:12.358 --> 44:16.736
I didn't, Your Honor.
I voted for... well...

44:16.779 --> 44:18.112
Time will tell.

44:18.197 --> 44:20.865
After all, Rogers, nobody in
this house is above suspicion.

44:21.408 --> 44:25.578
Never in my life, have I been
accused of any crime, sir.

44:25.871 --> 44:27.955
What about that
gramophone record?

44:30.042 --> 44:31.584
What about it?

44:32.169 --> 44:33.795
That woman you worked for,

44:33.879 --> 44:36.297
she left you some
money, didn't she?

44:37.466 --> 44:40.218
Let's not stand on
our dignity, Rogers.

44:40.302 --> 44:42.387
After all, she was sick.

44:42.680 --> 44:48.226
Didn't you shorten her
suffering in this world?

44:49.144 --> 44:53.064
With the complicity, of course,
of poor Mrs. Rogers?

44:53.982 --> 44:56.567
I'm not going to
argue with you, sir.

44:57.236 --> 45:00.321
But what makes you think
I would kill anybody

45:00.406 --> 45:02.907
who wasn't going to
leave me any money?

45:05.953 --> 45:07.787
No, thank you.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.251
Pardon me.

45:20.968 --> 45:23.761
Obviously, we can't
sit up all night, like this.

45:25.472 --> 45:28.891
I'm going to retire. Good night.

45:34.064 --> 45:36.607
If you don't mind,
I'll say good night too.

45:38.944 --> 45:40.862
If you don't mind,
Miss Claythorne,

45:40.946 --> 45:43.114
I would rather
go upstairs alone.

45:44.116 --> 45:46.617
May I remind you, Miss Brent,
that I am the only one

45:46.702 --> 45:48.786
whose name wasn't
mentioned in the voting.

45:48.871 --> 45:52.415
That's what I mean.
I find that fact most peculiar.

45:52.458 --> 45:55.042
I know Miss Brent won't mind
if there's a third person.

45:55.127 --> 45:57.628
Not so fast, Mr. Lombard.
I'll go with you.

45:57.713 --> 46:00.131
- The more the merrier.
- And safer.

46:24.615 --> 46:28.743
- Warm in here, isn't it?
- Yes, quite warm, quite warm.

46:28.827 --> 46:31.078
And lonely.

46:31.330 --> 46:34.415
Yes, quite lonely,
quite... quite lonely.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.794
- Rogers!
- Yes, sir?

46:39.046 --> 46:42.006
Oh, would you mind keeping us
company for a while?

46:42.299 --> 46:44.509
Anything you wish, sir.

46:47.846 --> 46:50.681
- Don't put any water in it.
- I shan't, sir.

46:53.769 --> 46:55.436
Good night, Miss Claythorne.

46:55.521 --> 46:57.355
Don't forget to lock your door.

46:57.439 --> 46:59.524
You cannot lock out the devil.

47:02.319 --> 47:04.278
I think there's another
one who's barmy.

47:04.947 --> 47:07.365
It's going to end with the
whole lot going that way.

47:07.449 --> 47:09.116
I don't fancy you will, Blore.

47:09.201 --> 47:12.703
No. It takes a lot to
send me off my head.

47:13.121 --> 47:16.123
I don't think you'll be
going that way, either.

47:16.208 --> 47:19.043
I feel quite sane at the moment.
Thank you.

47:24.132 --> 47:26.634
- Have you told him?
- Yes, sir.

47:26.718 --> 47:29.220
I know the jury's decision.

47:30.389 --> 47:33.933
You'll feel safer if I didn't
stay inside the house tonight.

47:34.017 --> 47:36.936
Well then, I shall sleep
in the woodshed.

47:36.979 --> 47:41.232
And now, if you'll excuse me.
Good night.

47:55.956 --> 47:59.584
- I'll lock it behind him.
- That's not enough, Mr. Blore.

48:04.548 --> 48:08.175
Still seven.
Lock that door, please.

48:11.138 --> 48:12.763
Put the key there.

48:14.224 --> 48:17.184
We'll have no more
Indian tricks tonight.

48:20.939 --> 48:22.690
Lock it, Mr. Blore.

48:26.361 --> 48:29.530
No wait! Now no one can
get in there but you.

48:29.615 --> 48:33.951
Oh, I see.
But, who's going to keep it?

48:43.211 --> 48:47.715
- Rogers! Open up, Rogers!
- Keep away from that door.

48:48.675 --> 48:50.718
It's me, Lombard! Open up!

48:51.094 --> 48:53.888
Do you take me for a fool,
Mr. Lombard?

48:53.972 --> 48:57.475
- Don't be silly, Rogers!
- Don't be silly yourself, sir.

48:57.559 --> 49:00.561
- This is Judge Quinncannon,
- You know my voice, Rogers!

49:00.646 --> 49:02.730
- Doctor Armstrong!
- This is Blore, Rogers.

49:02.814 --> 49:04.148
Open the door!

49:04.232 --> 49:06.317
At a time like this,
I wouldn't open the door

49:06.401 --> 49:08.569
even if it was Santa Claus.

49:08.654 --> 49:10.237
We just want to give you a key.

49:10.322 --> 49:12.823
- What for?
- Never mind, you idiot!

49:12.908 --> 49:14.825
Hurry up! It's raining!

49:15.243 --> 49:18.829
Shove it...
under the door, sir.

49:25.087 --> 49:27.630
Good night, Rogers.
Keep your door locked.

49:27.965 --> 49:30.257
Don't worry about me, sir.

49:51.488 --> 49:54.281
- Ohhh, be careful, Judge.
- Oh, I shall.

49:54.366 --> 49:57.910
You know, the common cold
kills more people than...

49:58.704 --> 50:01.080
Never mind.

50:08.130 --> 50:10.381
I need hardly advise
you to lock you doors.

50:10.465 --> 50:12.216
And put a chair
under the handle.

50:12.300 --> 50:15.052
There are ways of turning
locks from the outside.

50:17.139 --> 50:19.682
And if it should turn out that
one of you is Mr. Owen,

50:20.058 --> 50:22.810
just remember I'm
a very light sleeper.

50:22.894 --> 50:25.646
- Good night.
- Good night, gentlemen.

50:26.815 --> 50:29.025
May we all meet
safely in the morning.

50:29.234 --> 50:31.318
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

51:09.441 --> 51:12.026
Miss Brent! Miss Brent!

51:12.110 --> 51:14.195
She doesn't answer!

51:14.279 --> 51:16.781
- Is her door locked?
- Of course, try it!

51:19.284 --> 51:21.077
She's not here!

51:21.453 --> 51:24.121
You grasp the fact
very quickly, Blore.

51:24.456 --> 51:26.040
What's wrong, Mr. Blore?

51:26.124 --> 51:27.875
- Miss Brent's missing.
- I knocked on all your doors,

51:27.959 --> 51:29.293
she was the only one
that didn't answer.

51:29.377 --> 51:30.711
What's wrong with that?
It's late.

51:30.796 --> 51:32.129
We all overslept.

51:32.214 --> 51:34.632
I heard her get up.
She must gone downstairs.

51:45.977 --> 51:48.979
- I locked that door last night.
- Who opened it?

51:49.064 --> 51:50.481
Look.

51:52.901 --> 51:56.320
Good morning.
It's such a pretty pattern.

51:56.404 --> 51:58.114
I thought I'd like to copy
it for a new shawl.

51:58.198 --> 52:00.324
Was that door locked
when you went out?

52:00.408 --> 52:02.910
- Oh, yes, I opened it.
- Good morning, Miss Brent.

52:02.994 --> 52:05.496
I too like to walk
before breakfast.

52:05.580 --> 52:07.414
But I wouldn't have
gone out alone.

52:07.499 --> 52:10.918
I feel perfectly safe when
I'm alone. Thank you.

52:11.002 --> 52:12.586
I share your feeling.

52:12.671 --> 52:15.339
But didn't you know you that
Rogers was outside?

52:15.423 --> 52:18.509
Poor man.
I hope he didn't catch cold.

52:21.471 --> 52:22.847
What's that?

52:22.931 --> 52:24.515
- Someone's knocking.
- Kitchen door.

52:24.599 --> 52:26.350
Rogers, of course.
He wants to get in.

52:26.434 --> 52:28.269
That's it. We forgot
all about breakfast.

52:36.945 --> 52:39.738
- Where is he?
- Somebody was knocking.

52:42.701 --> 52:58.716
Rogers!

52:59.050 --> 53:02.469
- He's not there.
- Rogers!

53:02.554 --> 53:06.807
Know what I think?
We got our man. It's Rogers!

53:06.892 --> 53:08.976
It fits the
psychological pattern.

53:09.060 --> 53:12.229
His behavior last night
was distinctly abnormal.

53:12.314 --> 53:15.191
Psychological pattern, my eye.
I go by facts.

53:15.233 --> 53:17.735
He was officially accused,
Fact!

53:17.819 --> 53:19.236
He got drunk.

53:19.321 --> 53:21.655
He wouldn't open the door
to the woodshed. Fact!

53:21.740 --> 53:23.240
Realizing this morning,

53:23.325 --> 53:25.826
that he'd gone to the end
of his rope. He disappears.

53:25.911 --> 53:27.328
Fact!

53:27.412 --> 53:29.872
There's another fact you
haven't mentioned about Rogers.

53:30.624 --> 53:32.541
He's dead.

53:39.466 --> 53:41.258
The murderer was fastidious.

53:41.343 --> 53:43.761
He cleaned this blade
after striking down his victim.

53:43.845 --> 53:46.680
Obviously he crept up behind,
swung this chopper

53:46.765 --> 53:49.516
and brought it down,
splitting the cranium.

53:53.063 --> 53:55.606
Seven little Indian boys
chopping up sticks.

53:55.690 --> 53:59.610
One chopped himself in half
and then there were six.

54:00.153 --> 54:03.530
Would it have needed much
strength to strike the blow?

54:04.199 --> 54:06.450
Well, a woman
could have done it.

54:06.534 --> 54:08.369
If that's what you mean.

54:09.579 --> 54:12.289
Miss Claythorne was locked
in her room, Doctor,

54:12.540 --> 54:14.708
if that's what you mean.

54:14.793 --> 54:17.211
We were all in our rooms.

54:18.296 --> 54:20.297
Except...

54:22.550 --> 54:25.302
- No breakfast yet?
- No.

54:25.512 --> 54:29.223
If I had a butler like Rogers.
I'd soon get rid of him.

54:32.394 --> 54:34.478
Wait! We we've
forgotten something.

54:34.562 --> 54:36.230
- What?
- The dining room!

54:39.109 --> 54:41.235
It's still locked.
Where's the key?

54:42.028 --> 54:44.071
We found it in Rogers's pocket.

54:49.869 --> 54:53.998
One. Two. Three.
Four. Five. Six.

54:54.082 --> 54:56.917
- Another one missing?
- But the door was locked.

54:58.962 --> 55:00.671
I get it!

55:04.968 --> 55:06.677
No I don't.

55:12.183 --> 55:14.601
Did you ever hear of a
bee sting being fatal?

55:14.686 --> 55:16.353
No, why?

55:16.438 --> 55:19.023
Six little Indian boys
playing with a hive.

55:19.065 --> 55:22.901
A bumblebee stung one
and then there were five.

55:28.241 --> 55:30.868
Very stupid to kill the
only servant in the house.

55:30.952 --> 55:33.287
Now we don't even know
where to find the marmalade.

55:33.330 --> 55:35.831
Watch out for a bee.

55:40.795 --> 55:42.629
I'd be careful with
that young man.

55:42.714 --> 55:46.383
I mean to, Miss Brent.
I'm careful of everyone.

55:46.718 --> 55:49.219
A clear conscience
is the best armor.

55:49.262 --> 55:51.305
This island is in
the image of life.

55:51.639 --> 55:54.600
The innocent has to be
surrounded by criminals.

55:54.684 --> 55:57.311
That sounds like
Mr. Owen talking.

55:57.395 --> 56:00.314
I see nothing wrong with his
idea of punishing the guilty.

56:03.943 --> 56:07.071
What about his
accusations against you?

56:07.614 --> 56:09.656
I wonder if these
eggs are fresh.

56:09.741 --> 56:11.241
What about it, Miss Brent.

56:11.326 --> 56:14.036
Your young nephew, aren't
you to blame for his death?

56:14.120 --> 56:15.996
Family gossip, Miss Claythorne.

56:16.081 --> 56:17.998
My sister's boy had bad blood.

56:18.041 --> 56:19.666
From the father's side,
of course.

56:19.709 --> 56:21.418
But he was no good, naturally.

56:21.461 --> 56:23.879
I had to have him
placed in a reformatory.

56:24.255 --> 56:26.590
I do hope these
eggs aren't overcooked.

56:28.635 --> 56:30.386
What happened to the boy?

56:30.428 --> 56:32.012
Oh, I never saw him again.

56:32.055 --> 56:34.598
He added to his many sins
by hanging himself.

56:39.687 --> 56:42.856
I got it! I know who
took the last Indian.

56:42.941 --> 56:45.526
- Who?
- Rogers.

56:47.737 --> 56:50.823
He had the key to
this room. Fact.

56:50.865 --> 56:53.534
He sneaks in and
takes a little Indian.

56:53.576 --> 56:56.161
Locks the door again.

56:56.246 --> 57:00.707
Goes back to the woodshed where
he chops some sticks. Fact.

57:01.167 --> 57:04.294
- And then...
- And then...

57:04.337 --> 57:06.296
He takes the chopper and
splits his own cranium,

57:06.381 --> 57:08.465
as the Doctor would say. Fact.

57:08.550 --> 57:10.634
I'd like to see you do
that to yourself, Blore.

57:10.718 --> 57:12.553
It would take practice.

57:15.557 --> 57:19.643
Anyone inside the house could
leave without being noticed.

57:19.686 --> 57:23.063
- True, Miss Brent?
- Perfectly true.

57:23.440 --> 57:26.650
The murderer meets Rogers
outside and kills him.

57:27.152 --> 57:29.820
He then takes the key
from his victim's pocket,

57:29.904 --> 57:31.989
and you know the rest.

57:32.991 --> 57:37.327
Yes, but the key was still
in Rogers' pocket!

57:37.370 --> 57:39.163
Of course.

57:39.330 --> 57:41.832
The murderer puts the
key back in Rogers' pocket

57:41.916 --> 57:43.667
and goes to bed again.

57:43.877 --> 57:47.880
Or goes for an innocent
walk before breakfast.

57:48.548 --> 57:50.466
Sorry, Miss Brent.

57:52.635 --> 57:54.970
Anyone have more tea?

57:59.476 --> 58:01.226
Lombard!

58:09.360 --> 58:12.446
- Lombard!
- Yes, Blore?

58:23.082 --> 58:25.292
- What you doing here?
- You called me, didn't you?

58:25.376 --> 58:28.170
Yes. Oh, yes, yes.

58:28.588 --> 58:29.963
I ain't saying,

58:30.048 --> 58:32.299
but don't you think the
old judge knows too much?

58:32.342 --> 58:34.134
Describing every move...

58:34.344 --> 58:36.220
You'd think he had been
at the scene of the crime.

58:36.387 --> 58:38.972
My dear Blore, in my opinion
you haven't a chance.

58:39.140 --> 58:41.975
- Why is that?
- Lack of imagination.

58:42.060 --> 58:44.061
A criminal with a
brain like U N Owen...

58:44.145 --> 58:46.396
can think rings around you,
anytime he wants to.

58:46.439 --> 58:49.483
No man ever got the
better of me... yet.

58:49.567 --> 58:50.901
How about a woman?

58:52.278 --> 58:55.739
Yes, yes, one should
never trust a woman.

58:55.823 --> 58:57.741
She's clearly a
manic-depressive.

58:57.825 --> 58:59.826
I don't know why I
didn't see it before.

58:59.911 --> 59:02.412
She was very strange in
the kitchen this morning.

59:02.539 --> 59:04.164
We all behaved strangely,

59:04.249 --> 59:08.085
but I find no evidence.
She left no clue.

59:08.169 --> 59:09.586
But she did.

59:14.884 --> 59:16.677
What about this, eh?

59:17.178 --> 59:19.888
No sane person would
think about using seaweed

59:19.973 --> 59:21.598
as a pattern for a shawl.

59:21.683 --> 59:23.433
She tried to throw
us off the track.

59:23.518 --> 59:26.436
It's her!
I'll stake my life, it's her.

59:27.105 --> 59:28.522
Wait, Blore.

59:28.606 --> 59:30.566
Let Miss Claythorne call her.

59:30.608 --> 59:32.901
She'll be less suspicious.

59:38.825 --> 59:45.581
Miss Brent!

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.787
Miss Brent! Miss Brent!

01:00:26.247 --> 01:00:29.416
It's no use, Miss Claythorne.
She'll not answer.

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:36.590
Look at the bee!
Look at the bee!

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:41.511
Just an ordinary bee,
Miss Claythorne.

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:46.350
Nothing, but a small
mark on the neck.

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.602
Here's your bee, Doctor.

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:05.619
Somebody must have taken it.
It's not here. See for yourself.

01:01:05.703 --> 01:01:08.872
- What poison was injected?
- I can only guess.

01:01:08.956 --> 01:01:13.710
It was very potent.
She must have died immediately.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:18.340
But the bee.
That bee in her room.

01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:20.967
That's our murderer's
artistic touch

01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:24.012
He likes to stick to his
blasted nursery jingle.

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:25.889
He's mad. We're all mad.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:30.519
I'm not, Mr. Lombard. I still
have my reasoning powers.

01:01:31.312 --> 01:01:36.149
There are five of us left.
One of us is a murderer.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:39.569
- The rest of us are defenseless.
- Defenseless?

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:42.656
How do we know one of us
hasn't have a revolver?

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.242
A good point, Blore!
How do we know?

01:01:45.326 --> 01:01:49.413
Well, I know I haven't got one.
Dear me, it's against the law.

01:01:49.747 --> 01:01:51.498
How about you, Doctor?

01:01:51.582 --> 01:01:54.167
Of course not. You may search
me, gentlemen, search me.

01:01:54.335 --> 01:01:56.670
- Miss Claythorne?
- I wish I had.

01:01:56.754 --> 01:01:59.798
Quite right, Miss Claythorne,
it's an unfortunate oversight.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:01.258
One should never
be careless, when

01:02:01.342 --> 01:02:02.843
visiting a place
one doesn't know.

01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:05.846
Why didn't you tell us that
you had a revolver?

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:07.431
Nobody asked me.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.016
I've got him!
Search his pockets.

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:12.686
Aren't you wasting your time?

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.021
I know where it is.

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:20.694
Judge, you said just now that
one of us was the murderer.

01:02:20.778 --> 01:02:23.780
If I were you, I wouldn't
let Blore get at that gun.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.038
It's not here!

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:34.040
Look again, Blore.
It's got to be there.

01:02:35.376 --> 01:02:36.793
Look in his pockets!

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.545
Don't. Get him off. Get him off.

01:02:38.629 --> 01:02:39.963
It's not here.

01:02:40.047 --> 01:02:42.758
- What did you do with it?
- What did you do with it?

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:44.885
Good heavens, where is it?

01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:46.803
The one who can answer
that question,

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:49.222
is obviously not going to speak.

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:16.917
At a time like this.

01:03:17.418 --> 01:03:21.171
A game of the mind, Blore,
a game of the mind.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.842
You know the safest
thing for you to do

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:28.011
is stay in your room,
with the door locked.

01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:29.596
What about yourself?

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.098
Oh, I wouldn't stay out here
alone with any of the others.

01:03:32.433 --> 01:03:33.934
Why not?

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.603
Don't you think it strange
that there's never

01:03:36.687 --> 01:03:40.190
a third person present when
anything unpleasant occurs?

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:44.361
Mr. Owen always manages
to be alone with his victim.

01:03:44.695 --> 01:03:48.865
When a third person is
present, nothing happens.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:54.204
Doesn't that make you nervous,
out here with me, alone?

01:03:54.288 --> 01:03:56.206
But, we're not alone.

01:03:56.290 --> 01:04:01.378
I asked Mr. Blore to keep an
eye on us. He's my third person.

01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:07.384
Blore!

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.642
Look, another misfortune.

01:04:16.727 --> 01:04:18.728
Something wrong
with the machinery.

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:21.314
Batteries must be running down.

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:24.901
We've got to keep every light
in the house burning tonight.

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:27.404
I'll go to the woodshed
and see to it.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:32.659
Leave it on, Doctor,
leave it on.

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:38.665
Put you off your game,
wouldn't it, this flickering?

01:04:38.749 --> 01:04:42.419
You went away from the
window and left me alone.

01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:43.837
I've got to go to the woodshed.
You better go

01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:45.589
to your room and lock your door.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:47.007
I shall.

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:09.029
- Where's Miss Claythorne?
- I don't know.

01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:11.865
- Where's Blore?
- Went out to the woodshed.

01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:13.617
Woodshed?

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:24.127
What's wrong, Doctor?

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:31.468
Oh, I see. You and I, well,
we are alone in the house.

01:05:31.677 --> 01:05:33.386
- Lombard!
- Lombard!

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:35.055
- Come here!
- Don't leave us!

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.154
- Where's Vera?
- Vera?

01:05:51.238 --> 01:05:53.156
- Miss Claythorne! Answer me!
- Don't come any closer!

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.741
- Where is she?
- Keep back!

01:05:54.825 --> 01:05:56.493
Blore, if I you don't tell me,
I swear I'll kill you.

01:05:56.577 --> 01:05:58.912
If you make another move,
I'll brain you.

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:02.415
You know, Doctor, please
give me a chance.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.669
If you are Mr. Owen,
friend tell me.

01:06:05.878 --> 01:06:08.505
I... I won't say a
word to the others.

01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:10.590
Don't torment me this way.

01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:15.220
If you want to kill the
others, I won't interfere.

01:06:15.262 --> 01:06:17.097
I won't say a word.

01:06:17.181 --> 01:06:19.766
I'll even help you if
you spare my life.

01:06:20.017 --> 01:06:24.938
Look, I trust you.
Don't you trust me?

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:29.025
- Um... yes.
- That's more reasonable.

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.777
Don't come any closer!

01:06:32.196 --> 01:06:35.365
- Isn't your arm getting tired?
- Don't worry about me.

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:38.702
Listen, if Miss Claythorne is
safe in her room as you say,

01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:40.120
we are both behaving
like idiots.

01:06:40.204 --> 01:06:42.330
Can't get round me that way.
I prefer being a living idiot.

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:44.791
- Hang on, someone's coming.
- What?

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:50.213
Miss Claythorne! I told you
to stay locked in your room.

01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:54.300
I'm looking for... oh.

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:56.803
He's right, Vera.
You shouldn't be so careless!

01:06:56.887 --> 01:06:58.805
- Come on!
- Stay here, both of you.

01:06:58.889 --> 01:07:01.141
Now I can do what
I came out to do.

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:04.561
Do not know anything
about electricity?

01:07:04.645 --> 01:07:07.147
Don't bother me. I get it!

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:10.817
- Stay where you are!
- I shan't move an inch.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.738
Neither will I
till the light comes on.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:18.742
- Do you think it will?
- Why not?

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.328
This is no accident.

01:07:22.413 --> 01:07:24.914
Someone wants this
house to be dark at night.

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:27.417
- Who?
- The one we fear.

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:30.420
My dear, Doctor,
we've made a mistake.

01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:34.340
This trick of putting
out the lights,

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:38.428
clears two people, you and me.

01:07:38.512 --> 01:07:40.764
Now we can trust each other.

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:46.102
I see! The idea was keep
us in fear of each other.

01:07:46.353 --> 01:07:49.272
But now we can form
an alliance, you and I.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.692
And find the murderer.

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:57.030
We no longer have anything to
conceal from each other have we.

01:07:57.281 --> 01:07:59.616
Just what I was thinking.

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:04.037
Oh ho, I needed that.

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:07.123
Now?

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:09.793
Now we can tell
each other the truth.

01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:11.878
The entire truth.

01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:25.809
Who's going to speak first?

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:31.648
Very well, I shall begin.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:37.237
As you know, Mr. Owen's
saying that I was responsible

01:08:37.321 --> 01:08:40.156
for the death of one
Edward Seaton.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.908
It's perfectly true.

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:46.912
He was an innocent man
on trial for his life.

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:48.997
I'd nothing against him.

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:53.837
I wanted to ruin the reputation
of his defending counsel,

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:59.926
who lost the case,
while his client lost his life.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:05.014
Doctor? Tell us the truth.

01:09:05.432 --> 01:09:09.352
Your fate depends on it.
I'm convinced of that.

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:18.111
The gramophone
record did not lie.

01:09:18.194 --> 01:09:22.532
I operated on Mrs. Cleese while
under the influence of uh...

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:28.705
Guilty, I was, but of
drinking not of killing.

01:09:34.252 --> 01:09:36.796
I don't see where
this is getting us.

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.631
Sit down, Mr. Blore.

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:42.218
This is getting us to a
very important conclusion.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:44.386
Isn't that right, Doctor?

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:47.055
If I were you,
I would speak, Mr. Blore.

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:53.229
- I didn't kill anybody!
- We're listening, Mr. Blore.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.567
This Landor chap
was innocent all right,

01:09:57.651 --> 01:10:00.320
but I was mixed up with the
gang that was out to get him.

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:03.573
On my testimony,
he got sent up for life.

01:10:03.657 --> 01:10:05.158
That's all.

01:10:05.576 --> 01:10:07.994
But he died in prison,
didn't he?

01:10:08.495 --> 01:10:10.330
Course he did!

01:10:10.831 --> 01:10:12.999
How could I know
that would happen?

01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:15.084
What about yourself Mr. Lombard?

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:18.504
What about those 21 poor
natives in South Africa?

01:10:20.132 --> 01:10:22.425
Don't get excited, Blore.

01:10:23.135 --> 01:10:26.429
Mr. Lombard is unable
to deny a thing.

01:10:26.513 --> 01:10:29.933
Ah ha! That's the first
thing you said I believe.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:33.603
Are you leaving us,
Miss Claythorne?

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:38.524
My dear child, you're trembling.

01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:41.527
I... I'm so cold.

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:44.197
Would you like us to
postpone this inquiry,

01:10:44.281 --> 01:10:45.782
while we build a fire?

01:10:45.866 --> 01:10:52.038
That would mean going outside
to get wood, as Rogers did.

01:10:52.122 --> 01:10:55.792
No. We wait while
you get your coat.

01:10:55.876 --> 01:10:57.460
Thank you.

01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:05.468
Stay here, Mr. Lombard.

01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:08.805
Nothing can happen to her
if we all remain in this room.

01:11:24.071 --> 01:11:25.571
Aah!

01:11:31.912 --> 01:11:34.038
- Vera!
- Claythorne!

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:35.498
- Get a light!
- Haven't got one!

01:11:35.582 --> 01:11:38.251
- Who is it?
- It's me, Blore!

01:11:38.335 --> 01:11:39.585
- Guy Lombard!

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:41.504
- Where's Blore?
- How do I know in the dark.

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:43.923
Where have you
been all this time?

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.925
I went to my room
to get this candle.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:47.510
Where have you been?

01:11:47.594 --> 01:11:49.262
I've been looking
for my flashlight.

01:11:49.346 --> 01:11:51.014
Where is Blore?

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:55.226
Blore! What the devil are
you doing in my room?

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:58.604
Your room? No wonder
I couldn't find anything.

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:00.857
- What happened to you?
- Somebody bumped into me.

01:12:00.941 --> 01:12:02.608
- Did you hear anything?
- Yes, sounded like a shot.

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:04.193
Sounded like
something fell to me.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.446
You're jumpy,
both of you. Nerves.

01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:09.198
It's Vera's.

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:15.288
Vera!

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:20.209
Vera! What happened?

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:22.128
Don't be frightened, Vera.
What happened?

01:12:22.212 --> 01:12:24.881
- He was in my room.
- Who?

01:12:24.965 --> 01:12:28.718
I felt. Oh, I don't know...

01:12:28.802 --> 01:12:30.636
- Something like a hand.
- Who was it?

01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:34.140
I don't know.
My candles went out.

01:12:34.224 --> 01:12:36.225
We'll soon find out.

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:49.155
Help! Lights! Lights!

01:12:51.241 --> 01:12:52.909
Seaweed.

01:12:53.952 --> 01:12:56.537
It felt like a cold hand.

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:58.998
That's what Miss Claythorne
walked into.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.084
Who brought it in here?

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.961
Who brought it into the house?

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:09.175
- Miss Brent.
- Are you sure, Miss Brent is...

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:28.528
- Dead as a doornail.
- Where's the judge?

01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:32.865
That's funny, I thought
he came up with us.

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:34.283
So did I.

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:35.952
He was right behind
me on the staircase.

01:13:36.036 --> 01:13:40.623
Yes, I thought I bumped into
him when I heard that shot.

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:43.042
- Shot? What did I tell you?
- What?

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.710
Why, the old bloke
knew too much.

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:46.295
- You say you heard a shot?
- Yes.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.881
Well, don't you see? He took
a shot at us in the dark.

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:51.134
He'll pot us like clay pigeons,
when we go downstairs.

01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:53.219
There's one way to find out!

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:05.565
It's my own.

01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:08.484
No. It looks too easy.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.242
Alright, Judge, come outside.

01:14:17.494 --> 01:14:19.245
Don't think I can't see you.

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:33.426
He has been shot
through the head.

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:38.514
Only one shot fired.

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:48.608
Who will be next?

01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:55.281
Another one proved innocent.
Too late.

01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:58.284
He'd found the solution. That's
why he had to be silenced.

01:14:58.368 --> 01:15:02.955
- Silenced by who?
- By whom? Don't you remember?

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:12.548
One moment, Miss Claythorne!

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:18.721
Just when the judge was
about to question you...

01:15:18.805 --> 01:15:21.474
you came up here,
presumably to get your coat.

01:15:21.558 --> 01:15:23.142
True?

01:15:24.645 --> 01:15:26.229
Yes.

01:15:26.313 --> 01:15:28.231
You opened that door.

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:30.942
Wind blows out your candles,
seaweed touches your face...

01:15:30.984 --> 01:15:32.944
You scream. Perfect, perfect.

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:35.238
But, considerable time elapses,

01:15:35.322 --> 01:15:36.906
and then we find
you way down there.

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:38.658
What made you run the wrong way?

01:15:38.742 --> 01:15:41.160
She didn't know where she
was going. She was hysterical.

01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:42.662
Agreed.

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:44.664
But if Miss Claythorne
had not screamed,

01:15:44.748 --> 01:15:46.582
we would still be
in the dining room,

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:48.084
and the judge would be alive.

01:15:48.168 --> 01:15:51.170
Now wait a minute.
Don't confuse things.

01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:52.838
One of you two
pulled this trigger

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:54.173
and you're trying to pin
it on Miss Claythorne.

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:55.758
Now you wait a minute,
Mr. Lombard.

01:15:55.842 --> 01:15:57.426
We know very well that the judge

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.095
was on the point of an
important discovery.

01:15:59.179 --> 01:16:00.846
How do we know what was
in the judge's mind?

01:16:00.931 --> 01:16:03.099
I do know.
He took me into his confidence.

01:16:03.183 --> 01:16:06.519
Truth. The entire truth.

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:10.898
Miss Claythorne,
did you or did you not,

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:13.609
commit the crime, of which the
gramophone accused you?

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.695
I'd rather not talk about it.

01:16:15.779 --> 01:16:20.533
Ah, but you must. We've all
confessed our little errors.

01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:23.828
All except you.
Come now, my girl.

01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:27.582
You didn't really kill this
Barclay chap did you?

01:16:27.624 --> 01:16:30.710
Will you take my word,
if I tell you I didn't?

01:16:30.794 --> 01:16:32.545
I'm afraid, I will.

01:16:32.879 --> 01:16:34.797
Then you have my word for it.

01:16:34.965 --> 01:16:38.217
And don't ask me
any more questions.

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:42.972
Can't you see
she's telling the truth?

01:16:43.056 --> 01:16:45.141
That is precisely her mistake.

01:16:45.225 --> 01:16:47.893
- I don't see why.
- You will. You will.

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:49.729
The judge reasoned it out.

01:16:50.355 --> 01:16:53.149
Owen enticed us to this island

01:16:53.233 --> 01:16:55.026
to be punished for
our past crimes.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.485
Right.

01:16:56.570 --> 01:17:01.407
We three have admitted,
shall I say, our guilt.

01:17:01.491 --> 01:17:02.825
Right.

01:17:02.909 --> 01:17:04.493
Therefore, we cannot
be interested in

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:06.996
- the punishment of crime.
- Right.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.874
Conclusion: Owen is the one

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:12.251
who has not committed
any past crimes.

01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:15.588
I get it!
What a wonderful brain.

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:18.341
To think he couldn't
save his own life.

01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:19.759
Yes, but he saved ours.

01:17:19.843 --> 01:17:21.844
Yes of course,
that's the important thing.

01:17:23.555 --> 01:17:26.098
Do you understand now,
Mr. Lombard?

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:29.268
Oh, it's great. Convincing.
Mathematical deduction.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:33.522
Oh, wait a minute.

01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:35.775
- Oh, no!
- Not you either, Blore.

01:17:38.278 --> 01:17:39.987
Now nobody has it.

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:41.614
That's an excellent arrangement.

01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:44.617
- Now we can all sleep.
- Let's turn in, gentlemen.

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:54.377
Good night, gentlemen.

01:17:54.461 --> 01:17:57.380
Doctor, I find one
flaw in your theory.

01:17:57.464 --> 01:17:59.715
I could destroy
it in four words.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.550
Do you want to hear them?

01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:05.805
Suppose I said: I am Mr. Owen.

01:18:06.264 --> 01:18:12.269
It would be most interesting.
But quite unlikely.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:16.649
Trouble with you, Lombard,
is nobody could believe you.

01:18:17.025 --> 01:18:19.110
Too bad.
I was just trying to be helpful.

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:20.820
Good night. Sleep well.

01:18:20.904 --> 01:18:22.738
I hope I will.

01:18:23.281 --> 01:18:25.324
I'm sure I will.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.104
How long have you
been out there?

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:38.981
Shh. Not so loud.

01:19:39.065 --> 01:19:41.108
But how long have
you been out there?

01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:43.152
Ever since you
put out your light.

01:19:43.236 --> 01:19:44.653
Why?

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:50.910
I wanted to be here to
welcome Mr. Owen.

01:19:51.286 --> 01:19:54.079
Locking you in this room and
leaving the key outside

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:55.581
is a little too obvious,
isn't it?

01:19:55.665 --> 01:19:57.750
It's the doctor or Blore.

01:19:57.834 --> 01:19:59.710
And unless I am mistaken,

01:19:59.753 --> 01:20:01.921
one of them is going to come
through that door at any minute.

01:20:02.005 --> 01:20:05.841
How do I know he's
not here already? You.

01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:08.677
If you believe that you wouldn't
have opened your window.

01:20:09.012 --> 01:20:12.139
- What about me?
- Hmm. You're not smart enough.

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:15.017
A quick thinking girl would have
confessed to any old crime,

01:20:15.101 --> 01:20:17.853
in order to clear herself of
what's happened in this house.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:23.776
Are you sure, you didn't
kill this fellow, Barclay?

01:20:25.946 --> 01:20:28.280
Maybe you forgot about it.

01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:33.118
Or maybe he never existed.

01:20:33.453 --> 01:20:38.249
- Yes, he did.
- Or maybe, he was never killed.

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:42.461
Yes, he was.

01:20:44.047 --> 01:20:50.052
By someone who was close to you?
And you were suspected?

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:55.057
What happened to that someone,
who was close to you?

01:20:56.059 --> 01:20:57.977
She was my sister.

01:20:58.728 --> 01:21:02.356
I took care of her
to the very last.

01:21:04.734 --> 01:21:07.570
Oh, now I see that Mr. Owen
isn't infallible.

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:09.405
You don't belong in this house.

01:21:09.489 --> 01:21:10.906
You haven't killed
your way into it.

01:21:10.991 --> 01:21:12.324
Aren't you ashamed

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:14.660
of taking this ever so lightly,
Mr. Lombard?

01:21:14.744 --> 01:21:17.913
Don't call me Mister.
And don't call me Lombard.

01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:19.999
I'll tell you something
about Mr. Lombard.

01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:22.084
Something else that Mr. Owen
doesn't know...

01:21:22.168 --> 01:21:23.502
Listen!

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:31.427
Give me a chance to grab him
when he comes in.

01:21:31.511 --> 01:21:33.679
Don't shoot unless you have to.

01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:49.361
- He's going away.
- Down the stairs.

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:51.196
I'm going to find out.

01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:55.951
I forgot. It's locked.

01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:59.955
- I'll go around the other way.
- Take the gun.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.540
Oh you keep it,
in case I can't get back.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:02.958
But he might kill you.

01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:05.210
If he does, he's going to
make a serious mistake.

01:22:05.295 --> 01:22:09.131
The other thing he doesn't
know is I am not Mr. Lombard.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:49.004
Now, we'll find out.
It's either Blore or the doctor.

01:22:49.089 --> 01:22:50.673
The one, who's not in his room.

01:22:53.343 --> 01:22:54.802
Blore!

01:22:54.886 --> 01:22:57.680
Blore! Get up. Open the door.

01:23:01.184 --> 01:23:03.185
Who let that girl
out of her room?

01:23:03.269 --> 01:23:05.854
Never mind about her.
Come on, Blore!

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:10.776
He's not here.
Now we know who it is.

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:13.278
I heard him go downstairs.
Come on, Blore. We'll catch him!

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:17.533
How do I know you
heard the doctor?

01:23:17.617 --> 01:23:19.118
Don't be a fool, Blore.

01:23:19.202 --> 01:23:22.121
- We've no time to waste.
- Ah, life is short, isn't it?

01:23:22.205 --> 01:23:25.290
- But I heard him too Mr. Blore.
- Oh, you did, did you?

01:23:26.584 --> 01:23:28.544
That's a nice present,
you've got there.

01:23:28.628 --> 01:23:30.379
Mr. Lombard's getting generous.

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:33.382
- You go first!
- Come on, Vera!

01:23:48.606 --> 01:23:50.065
Might be a trick.

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:52.317
Right, Blore.
Maybe, he's in the house.

01:23:59.576 --> 01:24:02.745
One. Two. Three.
Three Indians only.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:06.123
He wants to make
us think, he's dead.

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:08.584
That's to throw
us off the track.

01:24:08.668 --> 01:24:12.421
You don't fool us this time,
Dr. Armstrong!

01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:17.926
Who's there?

01:24:51.711 --> 01:24:53.337
Lombard!

01:24:57.759 --> 01:25:00.094
Blore. What are you doing
down there alone?

01:25:00.136 --> 01:25:01.804
I think I know where
the doctor is.

01:25:01.888 --> 01:25:03.222
Where?

01:25:03.306 --> 01:25:04.807
I'm not sure yet.
I'll wait for you.

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:07.059
Alright. We shan't be long.

01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:00.445
I get it!

01:26:26.347 --> 01:26:28.182
Aren't you being careless,
unlocking your door

01:26:28.224 --> 01:26:29.683
when you don't know
who's out here?

01:26:29.767 --> 01:26:31.226
But I thought it was you.

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:34.563
- You heard it too, eh?
- I heard you pass my door.

01:26:35.398 --> 01:26:38.567
Not me. I thought I heard you.

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:41.320
Are you sure you haven't
been outside of your room?

01:26:41.571 --> 01:26:44.573
I wanted to ask
you the same thing.

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:48.577
Maybe, Mr. Blore came
back to his room.

01:26:48.661 --> 01:26:50.245
No, no-no.
I knocked on his door.

01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:51.872
I heard a noise
while I was dressing.

01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:54.124
- Like a door slamming?
- Exactly.

01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:55.834
You heard it too, huh?

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:00.923
- What is it?
- Oh, I don't know.

01:27:01.424 --> 01:27:03.842
I feel all the time that
there's someone...

01:27:03.927 --> 01:27:06.428
someone waiting and watching?

01:27:06.512 --> 01:27:07.846
Yes, I know what you mean.

01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:10.224
- Oh, it's just nerves.
- Then you have felt it.

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:11.975
Keep a grip on
yourself, darling.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.769
There's nothing supernatural
about this business.

01:27:13.853 --> 01:27:15.270
It's definitely human.

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:17.189
- You mean, it's the doctor?
- The mad doctor.

01:27:17.273 --> 01:27:19.524
- Hiding here?
- We'll soon find out.

01:27:21.778 --> 01:27:23.528
Aaah!

01:27:43.716 --> 01:27:45.968
He must have been
looking that way.

01:27:46.678 --> 01:27:50.138
And while he was looking,
Dr. Armstrong...

01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:53.183
That was Armstrong
we both heard.

01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:55.227
But what was Blore looking at?

01:27:57.939 --> 01:28:01.650
What do you see?
What is it?

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:05.654
- It's impossible!
- Let me see!

01:28:07.657 --> 01:28:11.660
You're going to see.
Come with me.

01:28:15.331 --> 01:28:17.666
What is it? What is it? Tell me.

01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:49.489
Look!

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:56.538
Armstrong.
He's been dead for hours.

01:28:57.415 --> 01:29:00.375
- For hours?
- Since the last tide.

01:29:00.918 --> 01:29:03.045
No footprints around the body.

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:12.512
But if he was...
Who killed Blore?

01:29:12.555 --> 01:29:15.974
Yes, there are only two people
alive on this island.

01:29:16.059 --> 01:29:17.976
- You.
- And you.

01:29:18.728 --> 01:29:21.063
So this is how it ends, Vera.

01:29:21.147 --> 01:29:25.233
This is how it ends.
We come to the truth now.

01:29:25.318 --> 01:29:27.986
Yes, the truth.
The entire truth.

01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:29.738
Don't come any closer!

01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:34.576
Oh, I see.
That's not quite right, my dear.

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:36.578
It doesn't fit in your
nursery rhyme.

01:29:36.662 --> 01:29:38.747
Don't try to talk your way out.

01:29:38.831 --> 01:29:42.834
You made one mistake,
giving me this revolver.

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:44.753
Look, I don't mind being killed.

01:29:44.837 --> 01:29:47.422
But I hate like the devil to
be killed for someone else.

01:29:47.507 --> 01:29:49.341
Didn't I tell you I
wasn't Lombard?

01:29:49.425 --> 01:29:51.343
- What is your name?
- Charles Morley.

01:29:51.427 --> 01:29:53.011
You're not a very
good detective.

01:29:53.096 --> 01:29:54.638
Mr. Blore spotted the
initials on my luggage,

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:56.098
the moment I arrived here.

01:29:56.182 --> 01:29:57.599
Why did you come here
under another name?

01:29:57.683 --> 01:30:00.018
I knew Lombard very well.
He committed suicide.

01:30:00.103 --> 01:30:02.187
I wanted to find out
if Mr. Owen's letter

01:30:02.271 --> 01:30:03.605
had anything to do with it.

01:30:03.689 --> 01:30:05.107
Do you expect me
to believe that?

01:30:05.191 --> 01:30:06.441
Why not?

01:30:06.526 --> 01:30:08.193
There's something much more
difficult to believe.

01:30:08.277 --> 01:30:09.861
That one of us is Mr. Owen.

01:30:09.946 --> 01:30:12.781
I know I'm not, and I simply
can't believe that you are.

01:30:12.865 --> 01:30:15.700
Don't try to fool me.
I know I'm not.

01:30:16.119 --> 01:30:20.288
It's got to be you.
There's no other explanation.

01:30:20.373 --> 01:30:23.041
If you're so sure, go
ahead and shoot me.

01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:25.043
You see? You have a doubt.

01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:27.462
Don't come any closer.
I'll shoot.

01:30:27.547 --> 01:30:29.047
No you won't. You can't shoot.

01:30:29.132 --> 01:30:30.799
You still trust me,
and I still trust you.

01:30:30.883 --> 01:30:33.385
There's got to
be an explanation.

01:30:36.556 --> 01:30:39.641
Yes, that's it!
You've got to shoot me!

01:30:39.725 --> 01:30:42.310
- Now shoot!
- But it won't hit you.

01:30:42.395 --> 01:30:45.313
That's what I mean! Shoot, and
don't be frightened if I fall.

01:32:04.435 --> 01:32:06.728
A game of the mind,
Miss Claythorne.

01:32:06.812 --> 01:32:09.314
You came just in time
for my last shot.

01:32:09.398 --> 01:32:11.900
And now the game is over.

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:18.490
One little Indian
boy left all alone.

01:32:18.574 --> 01:32:20.575
He went and hanged himself.

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:22.160
And then there were none.

01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:24.079
That's for you, Miss Claythorne.

01:32:24.247 --> 01:32:27.082
What if I don't agree
to hang myself?

01:32:27.166 --> 01:32:29.918
Oh, that's been taken care of.

01:32:31.254 --> 01:32:33.421
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:32:33.506 --> 01:32:36.174
Every artist has a certain
amount of vanity.

01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:39.427
We all like the
approbation of the public.

01:32:39.512 --> 01:32:41.513
And you are my last public.

01:32:41.722 --> 01:32:44.182
I had two great ideas.

01:32:44.267 --> 01:32:48.103
The first was a search for
perfect human justice.

01:32:48.187 --> 01:32:52.357
And you've seen the result.

01:32:52.858 --> 01:32:57.112
To perfect this scheme,
my second idea

01:32:57.196 --> 01:32:59.364
was to find an
unwitting accomplice

01:32:59.448 --> 01:33:02.450
among the criminals
invited here for punishment.

01:33:02.785 --> 01:33:05.620
I needed a respectable fool.

01:33:05.705 --> 01:33:08.123
And naturally I selected

01:33:08.207 --> 01:33:11.209
a man whose fear of death

01:33:11.294 --> 01:33:13.878
might make him
extremely cooperative.

01:33:13.963 --> 01:33:16.464
I proposed a scheme to confuse

01:33:16.549 --> 01:33:18.466
the imaginary Mr. Owen.

01:33:18.551 --> 01:33:20.468
It was simply this:

01:33:20.553 --> 01:33:23.013
I must appear to
be the next victim.

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.973
Remember the seaweed?

01:33:25.057 --> 01:33:27.475
Armstrong and I
placed it in your room.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:29.978
Your scream was perfect.

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:35.692
We pretended to rush out, but
according to our plan,

01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:37.402
we came back.

01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:41.323
Now, I was assumed to be dead.

01:33:41.407 --> 01:33:46.578
Killed by that gun,
I had borrowed from Mr. Lombard.

01:33:46.662 --> 01:33:49.831
And which he found
later on the steps.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.085
I counted on everyone's
confusion in the dark.

01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:58.923
And I counted on Armstrong
to play his part to the hilt.

01:34:09.518 --> 01:34:13.104
I knew no one would challenge
the doctor's authority.

01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:16.358
When he would say: He has
been shot through the head.

01:34:16.567 --> 01:34:20.028
After that, I had
to play my part.

01:34:20.112 --> 01:34:22.864
And what a part it was!

01:34:23.115 --> 01:34:26.951
No one would suspect me,
least of all the dear doctor,

01:34:27.036 --> 01:34:31.790
who thought I was about to
discover the unknown murderer,

01:34:31.874 --> 01:34:34.125
and was waiting for
me on the beach.

01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:36.795
And worrying about
the success of our plan.

01:34:36.879 --> 01:34:40.799
A few minutes later, he had
nothing more to worry about.

01:34:40.966 --> 01:34:44.886
Justice had triumphed
once again.

01:34:44.970 --> 01:34:47.555
Too late, he had
learned that drinking,

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:51.726
when it gets out of hand,
can be fatal.

01:34:51.894 --> 01:34:56.981
So you see, the whole thing
has been as inevitable

01:34:57.066 --> 01:34:58.817
as the nursery rhyme.

01:34:59.151 --> 01:35:01.486
When the boat arrives
from the mainland,

01:35:01.570 --> 01:35:03.988
there will be ten dead
bodies and a riddle,

01:35:04.073 --> 01:35:06.324
no one can solve
on Indian Island.

01:35:06.409 --> 01:35:07.992
Ten?

01:35:08.077 --> 01:35:11.413
My dear child,
I'm an old and sick man.

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:14.249
I received my death
sentence a year ago.

01:35:14.333 --> 01:35:18.086
Rather than go
painfully and slowly

01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:21.589
I choose to leave
this wicked world

01:35:21.674 --> 01:35:24.426
with a proud record
of good deeds.

01:35:26.178 --> 01:35:29.013
But how can you force me
to hang myself?

01:35:29.098 --> 01:35:31.850
The only living
person found here

01:35:31.934 --> 01:35:34.769
with nine corpses,
will certainly be hanged.

01:35:34.854 --> 01:35:37.272
As the last little Indian,
has to be.

01:35:40.484 --> 01:35:42.944
Public hanging isn't pretty.

01:35:43.028 --> 01:35:46.614
If you'll allow me to give
you a piece of friendly advice,

01:35:46.699 --> 01:35:49.117
do it now, privately.

01:35:49.201 --> 01:35:51.578
It's more dignified.

01:35:56.792 --> 01:35:59.544
And now my work is done.

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:10.013
Never should trust a woman.

01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:14.642
Thanks for the advice, Mr. Owen.

01:36:15.227 --> 01:36:16.811
But if I hadn't
trusted you, darling,

01:36:16.896 --> 01:36:18.229
and you hadn't trusted me...

01:36:18.314 --> 01:36:20.064
By the way,
why did you trust me?

01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:21.733
Why did you?

01:36:21.817 --> 01:36:25.278
On account of one thing,
Mr. Owen couldn't foresee.

01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:29.657
Aaah! Somebody!
Somebody's still alive!

01:36:34.705 --> 01:36:36.498
Good morning.

01:36:37.833 --> 01:36:40.919
- Ready to leave now?
- Ho, ho, are we!

01:36:41.003 --> 01:36:43.087
Are the others ready too?

01:36:43.839 --> 01:36:45.924
You call them.
