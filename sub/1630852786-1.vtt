00:21.153 --> 00:24.316
There are many schools of
martial arts in our country.

00:24.403 --> 00:26.642
One of which is the Southern style.

00:26.736 --> 00:32.152
Besides Hung, Lau, Choy and
Li, Mok styles,

00:32.236 --> 00:37.356
it also includes a popular style
called Wing Chun Kuen.

00:38.485 --> 00:42.858
Legend has it that Wing Chun Kuen
was founded by a Shaolin Abbess Ng Mui.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.693
She imparted her skills to a girl,
Yim Wing Chun.

00:45.777 --> 00:48.265
Hence the name Wing Chun Kuen.

00:48.360 --> 00:52.567
Yim imparted her skills
to her husband Leung Bok Chau.

00:52.651 --> 00:55.436
Leung taught Wong Wah Bo.

00:55.527 --> 00:58.310
Wong taught Leung Jan.

00:59.860 --> 01:07.432
Leung Jan's family owned a pharmacy,
Hang Sang Tong, in FoShan.

01:08.067 --> 01:12.641
He was a proficient herbalist
and qualified in bone manipulation.

01:12.734 --> 01:16.941
Leung Jan is a kind and helpful man.
He's very respected in the village.

01:17.025 --> 01:20.141
The villagers called him Master Jan.

01:20.233 --> 01:23.765
FoShan has another kind and
righteous man called Chan Wah.

01:23.858 --> 01:26.939
He's brave and would stand
against any injustice.

01:27.025 --> 01:30.306
He would help anyone in trouble.

01:30.399 --> 01:36.431
There are many Kung Fu experts in FoShan.

01:36.524 --> 01:39.724
Each has their own training school.

01:39.815 --> 01:43.679
Competition to get into
these schools was strong.

01:43.773 --> 01:46.393
Chan Wah has always been
interested in Kung Fu.

01:46.482 --> 01:49.349
He first learnt Kung Fu on his own.

01:49.440 --> 01:53.599
He later became a student of Leung Jan.

01:53.690 --> 01:56.688
He is to become the fifth generation
Wing Chun Master.

01:56.773 --> 02:01.845
Wah was working as
a cashier at Mok Kei Bank.

02:01.940 --> 02:04.724
He's known as Cashier Wah.

03:55.555 --> 03:57.759
My fellow villagers,

03:57.847 --> 04:00.251
Fatty's stall is now open...

04:00.346 --> 04:02.551
Please buy something.

04:02.638 --> 04:05.802
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've fresh rice dumplings.

04:05.889 --> 04:08.886
Every one is specially made.
Please try one.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.093
It's very tasty.

04:19.182 --> 04:21.422
Come on, please buy one.

04:21.515 --> 04:24.050
Hey! Tall one...
No, Uncle.

04:24.140 --> 04:27.138
Rice dumpling, look carefully before buying.

04:29.431 --> 04:31.801
Don't you like rice dumplings? OK...

04:34.349 --> 04:38.638
This is a special rice dumpling,
good with either sugar or salt.

04:41.307 --> 04:44.719
This is really special, it tastes wonderful.

04:46.223 --> 04:47.597
Marvelous.

04:50.016 --> 04:51.342
Hey!

04:56.099 --> 04:58.718
- Hey Fatty! I'm looking for a restaurant.
- What?

04:58.808 --> 05:02.588
Are you deaf?
Where's the restaurant?

05:02.683 --> 05:06.013
Straight from here,
then turn left and left and left.

05:06.100 --> 05:10.556
Left and left and left again.
When you see Ah Sao, you're there.

05:17.766 --> 05:21.926
- Fatty!
- Good morning, buying dumplings?

05:22.017 --> 05:24.849
- Wait.
- I've something to tell you.

05:24.933 --> 05:27.090
What? Someone in your family died?

05:27.184 --> 05:29.008
Nonsense, it's your family.

05:29.100 --> 05:32.514
All my family members have died.

05:32.601 --> 05:34.675
I'm the only survivor.

05:35.893 --> 05:39.056
Fatty, someone has been talking about you.

05:39.143 --> 05:40.719
Who's that?

05:40.810 --> 05:42.551
Spittle Mun.

05:42.642 --> 05:45.676
Spittle Mun? I don't know him.
What did he say?

05:45.768 --> 05:52.891
He said that Wing Chun Kuen is good
but what you learnt is crap.

05:55.143 --> 05:58.176
Everyone in FoShan
from three to 83 years old

05:58.268 --> 06:00.674
knows that I am a student of Leung Jan.

06:00.768 --> 06:04.050
- Really?
- How old is Spittle Mun?

06:05.311 --> 06:06.968
He's 84.

06:07.060 --> 06:09.466
No wonder.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.386
What's so good about Wing Chun?

06:11.477 --> 06:14.641
I'm good at Horse Groin Clamps.

06:14.728 --> 06:21.886
The Sifu of my Sifu was practicing
Horse Groin Clamps under a big tree.

06:21.978 --> 06:25.675
Suddenly there was a thunderstorm.

06:31.103 --> 06:32.892
A bolt of lightning felled the tree.

06:32.978 --> 06:35.218
The Sifu of my Sifu didn't move an inch.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.433
Such is the power of Horse Groin Clamps.

06:38.854 --> 06:41.223
- That's impressive.
- How is he now?

06:41.312 --> 06:45.008
He got struck by lightning and died.

06:45.103 --> 06:47.343
It's true, I was told.

06:47.437 --> 06:52.096
Spittle Mun said that
your Horse Groin Clamps isn't that good.

06:52.188 --> 06:56.561
If I'm in the stance,
ten of you can't move me.

06:56.646 --> 06:59.893
- Really?
- He's boasting.

06:59.979 --> 07:04.304
If you can handle the power of my palm,
I'll be impressed.

07:04.396 --> 07:06.434
Who do you think you are? Let's try.

07:06.522 --> 07:12.600
Let's bet then, if I can move you with
my palm, you give me all your dumplings.

07:12.688 --> 07:14.181
If you can't?

07:14.271 --> 07:16.889
Then I'll buy all your dumplings.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.017
- Good.
- Let's do it.

07:24.814 --> 07:28.760
- You're not to move once you're ready.
- OK.

07:51.732 --> 07:56.223
Hey! Mister, stop it. No! No!

07:56.315 --> 07:58.057
Mister!

07:59.606 --> 08:02.012
Why are you taking my dumplings?

08:02.106 --> 08:06.231
I'm not taking your dumplings,
I'm claiming them. You've lost the bet.

08:06.315 --> 08:07.596
Are you denying it?

08:07.692 --> 08:09.977
- I...
- I want to thank you.

08:10.066 --> 08:13.182
- Rice dumplings...
- Savory dumplings...

08:14.941 --> 08:19.432
Rice dumplings, savory dumplings,
sweet dumplings...

08:32.857 --> 08:36.224
How many?
Please come inside.

08:50.359 --> 08:52.397
Please be seated.

08:57.484 --> 08:58.942
Please be seated.

08:59.026 --> 09:01.479
Master, be seated.

09:01.567 --> 09:05.561
Damn, the table is too small for seven of us.

09:07.860 --> 09:10.395
We'll sit there, follow me.

09:17.234 --> 09:20.897
Master, I'm sorry but
this table has been reserved.

09:20.985 --> 09:22.976
Reserved? By who?

09:23.069 --> 09:26.731
Master Jan, this is his regular table.

09:26.819 --> 09:30.019
Master Jan? Never heard of him. Sit.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.568
Master...

09:34.444 --> 09:35.985
Master Jan.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.316
Third Uncle, look at them.

09:39.403 --> 09:41.441
It's nothing to do with you.

09:52.236 --> 09:54.061
So you're Master Jan.

09:54.153 --> 09:56.273
Yes, what can I do for you?

09:56.361 --> 09:58.399
Who is this girl?

09:58.486 --> 10:01.152
She's my niece.

10:01.236 --> 10:04.519
She's taken my seat,
what are you doing about it?

10:04.612 --> 10:06.733
I apologize.

10:07.863 --> 10:11.026
Kam Fung, stand up and
give your seat back to him.

10:18.654 --> 10:20.810
Bitch, trying to make fun of me?

10:22.696 --> 10:24.273
Stop it!

10:26.821 --> 10:29.356
We've just arrived and
you're already in trouble.

10:29.446 --> 10:31.187
It's not a time to fight.

10:34.612 --> 10:38.394
Gentleman, please tell me,
where is the Mok Kei Bank?

10:42.489 --> 10:46.068
Those bullies must have
taken advantage of you again.

10:47.239 --> 10:50.983
Cashier Wah, you can help someone poor.
Can you cure someone stupid?

10:51.072 --> 10:53.526
I don't think so.

10:54.906 --> 10:58.188
I want a change of career.
I'll sell watermelons next.

10:58.281 --> 11:02.025
Why? You make a loss
whenever you sell something.

11:02.113 --> 11:06.404
Even if people don't cheat you,
you end up eating all your stock.

11:07.114 --> 11:10.480
Why don't you give me some advice?
What business should I do?

11:14.114 --> 11:18.522
There's a job that you won't be cheated in
and you won't eat anything.

11:24.658 --> 11:28.486
- Fatty, not selling dumplings any more?
- I have a new career.

11:28.574 --> 11:32.235
New career? What are you selling now?
Can it be eaten?

11:38.533 --> 11:40.772
You're clearing shit now?

11:42.699 --> 11:45.899
If I don't change my career,
you'll cheat me again.

11:48.241 --> 11:52.152
Boss, we thought you were dead.
We're surprised to see you here.

11:53.866 --> 11:57.279
There's one more thing
that you'll never guess.

11:57.366 --> 12:01.657
I've opened a bank here
using the money we made together.

12:03.033 --> 12:08.983
We've been doing good business.
We've made twice as much now.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.197
Let's split the money.

12:11.284 --> 12:15.491
Iron Fist, you really are a pea-brain.

12:15.576 --> 12:18.608
Because of Mok Kei Bank

12:18.700 --> 12:23.488
I am a respectable man in this village.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.609
Boss, respectability doesn't buy food.

12:26.700 --> 12:31.653
But I can use it as a springboard.

12:33.159 --> 12:35.695
What do you have in mind?

12:38.952 --> 12:41.903
I want to control FoShan.

12:50.326 --> 12:55.233
There's still a bill in my pocket.
No wonder I couldn't balance the account.

12:55.327 --> 13:00.612
If I become the Village Head here,
you guys will have nothing to worry about.

13:00.702 --> 13:03.819
Aren't you afraid of other contenders?

13:04.827 --> 13:11.109
There's only one person in this village
who could compete with me.

13:11.203 --> 13:13.691
- Who's he?
- Leung Jan.

13:17.829 --> 13:21.822
If we want to kill the current Village Head,
it's easy.

13:21.912 --> 13:28.619
We just have to make it
look like an accident.

13:28.704 --> 13:30.576
I've already got a plan.

13:37.870 --> 13:42.243
Who's that?
Rushing around like a blind chicken?

13:42.329 --> 13:46.571
Master Yao, I've something important
to tell the Village Head.

13:48.204 --> 13:52.861
What makes you think that
the Village Head doesn't need to sleep?

13:52.953 --> 13:54.993
What's the matter?

14:10.455 --> 14:12.493
- Really?
- Yes.

14:12.581 --> 14:16.028
I didn't know that Boss Mok was like that.

14:16.122 --> 14:19.239
I hope you have not told anyone about this.

14:19.330 --> 14:21.036
I haven't.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.829
Good!

14:26.206 --> 14:30.946
This is an important matter,
you have to tell the Village Head personally.

14:31.039 --> 14:35.744
But you can't do it in his house.

14:35.831 --> 14:39.162
Let's meet at the Mountain Pavilion
early in the morning.

14:39.249 --> 14:42.081
I'll come with the Village Head.

14:57.874 --> 15:03.574
Cashier Wah, it was your misfortune
to have bumped into me.

15:03.665 --> 15:06.119
This must be the worst day of your life.

15:06.207 --> 15:08.244
What do you mean?

15:09.791 --> 15:14.579
It means that you have shit luck.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.823
Luck of a lump of shit.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.868
I don't know what are you talking about.

15:19.959 --> 15:22.956
- Where's the Village Head?
- The Village Head.

15:36.708 --> 15:38.746
My job is done.

17:14.088 --> 17:16.126
Brother Wah, what happened?

17:30.505 --> 17:32.330
Where is he?

17:33.588 --> 17:35.626
- Search inside.
- OK.

18:03.673 --> 18:05.710
What happened to him?

18:05.798 --> 18:09.045
I don't know, ask him when he's conscious.

18:20.756 --> 18:24.798
- You want Cashier Wah to come to us?
- Yes.

18:24.882 --> 18:28.923
Cashier Wah is a loyal family man.

18:30.091 --> 18:34.499
If something happens to his mother,
he'll definitely come to us.

18:35.758 --> 18:40.665
Remember, this time don't let him escape.

18:43.216 --> 18:45.254
You have a good rest.

18:46.009 --> 18:52.289
Fatty, go to my house and
tell my mother not to worry about me.

18:52.383 --> 18:54.871
OK, I'll do it now.

19:06.050 --> 19:08.504
What happened?

19:09.301 --> 19:15.416
I'm not sure, but I heard that Cashier Wah's
mother was killed by bandits last night.

19:28.969 --> 19:31.635
Where's Cashier Wah?

19:31.718 --> 19:33.460
I don't know.

19:33.552 --> 19:38.292
I've sent someone to the Mok Kei Bank
for him but he didn't go to work.

19:38.385 --> 19:41.419
- Put more men on the case, find him.
- OK.

20:01.803 --> 20:04.374
Fatty, how is my mum?

20:05.011 --> 20:06.753
She's very well.

20:06.845 --> 20:08.965
Did she tell you anything?

20:10.011 --> 20:12.298
She said...

20:13.428 --> 20:16.213
She said you shouldn't rush to see her.

20:16.304 --> 20:19.503
Fatty, besides my mum,
did you see anyone else?

20:19.595 --> 20:23.175
Yes, I saw the Village Head.

20:23.262 --> 20:26.924
- In my house?
- No, I saw him walking past.

20:29.638 --> 20:33.217
- Fatty, I have another favor to ask you.
- What?

20:33.305 --> 20:36.504
Tell the Village Head that
someone is trying to kill him.

20:36.596 --> 20:38.386
Ask him to be careful.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.757
- Is it true?
- Yes.

20:45.513 --> 20:46.887
Fatty.

20:46.971 --> 20:52.257
Tell the Village Head personally,
don't let anyone know about it.

21:08.930 --> 21:13.387
Fatty, any women bathing inside?
Why can't I see it?

21:14.806 --> 21:17.378
- Inside? Nothing there.
- Nothing?

21:17.472 --> 21:20.387
If there's nothing there,
what are you peeping at?

21:20.473 --> 21:22.178
Nothing.

21:22.264 --> 21:25.796
- If there's nothing to see, get out of here.
- All right.

21:31.681 --> 21:34.051
What are you looking at, bum?

21:43.100 --> 21:45.766
Hey! Village Head.

21:45.849 --> 21:48.598
- What is it?
- I've something to tell you.

21:48.683 --> 21:50.922
I'm busy, what is it?

21:52.974 --> 21:55.130
- Someone wants to kill you.
- What?

21:55.223 --> 21:58.009
Someone is trying to kill you,
you must be careful.

21:58.100 --> 22:01.430
Watch what you say.
Who wants to kill the village head?

22:01.516 --> 22:04.135
- I don't know.
- Then what are you on about?

22:04.225 --> 22:05.254
Nonsense.

22:10.974 --> 22:13.381
Trust me for once, I'm not lying.

22:13.475 --> 22:16.427
Who told you that?

22:21.101 --> 22:23.802
Someone, but I can't tell you his name.

22:23.892 --> 22:25.550
You are talking nonsense.

22:28.851 --> 22:32.051
Me? Talking nonsense? I don't think so.

22:37.060 --> 22:42.296
Stupid Fatty, I told you to get lost.
What are you doing here?

22:42.392 --> 22:45.640
- Nothing, nothing.
- Get lost then.

22:45.727 --> 22:48.215
- OK, I'm going.
- Scram.

22:55.894 --> 22:58.643
- Why the leg?
- I'm sorry.

22:58.728 --> 23:01.476
Looking for trouble?

23:07.686 --> 23:10.802
I'll kill you... I'll kill you!

23:13.603 --> 23:16.766
- What are you doing?
- Cramps.

23:19.727 --> 23:21.765
Much better now.

23:24.519 --> 23:26.556
Where has he gone?

23:27.769 --> 23:30.340
The next time I see you, you'll be dead.

24:16.939 --> 24:19.095
Fatty was telling the truth.

25:36.275 --> 25:37.898
Village Head!

27:48.989 --> 27:50.316
Serving The People

27:50.406 --> 27:53.522
Why isn't he here yet?
We're very busy.

27:55.947 --> 28:01.364
My fellow villagers, we've tried our best
to find the Village Head.

28:01.447 --> 28:04.530
This meeting can't happen without him.

28:04.615 --> 28:10.031
According to our constitution, if the
Village Head fails to attend without reason,

28:10.115 --> 28:14.274
we have the right to choose another head.

28:16.240 --> 28:19.239
Before we have more news
from the Village Head,

28:19.324 --> 28:26.446
I recommend that all his duties
fall to the boss of Mok Kei Bank.

28:26.531 --> 28:29.530
How about that?

28:29.614 --> 28:32.187
- Good, good, good.
- I agree.

28:38.824 --> 28:42.438
Cashier Wah, where are you going?

28:42.532 --> 28:44.488
To see my mum.

28:44.574 --> 28:46.649
You can't show yourself yet.

28:46.742 --> 28:50.403
I'll be careful.
I'll return as soon as I see her.

28:55.283 --> 28:58.565
- You won't recognize her.
- What do you mean?

29:00.033 --> 29:02.522
Your mum is dead.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.650
Fatty, say that again.

29:05.742 --> 29:10.280
I'm not lying.
I saw the undertakers carrying her out.

29:18.534 --> 29:20.276
It can't be true!

29:23.160 --> 29:26.192
Don't go! If those seven guys see you,
they won't let you go.

29:26.284 --> 29:28.358
They killed my mother. I want revenge.

29:30.285 --> 29:32.027
Listen to me.

29:33.369 --> 29:35.442
They did it to lure you out.

29:36.493 --> 29:38.614
You will fall for their trick if you go.

29:38.702 --> 29:40.905
I must avenge my mother's death.

29:44.702 --> 29:49.075
You're not their match,
they are too strong for you.

29:52.785 --> 29:55.569
If you want revenge, go beg my Sifu.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.153
Beg Master Jan.

29:57.243 --> 30:00.325
Cashier Wah is at Master Jan's.

30:00.411 --> 30:04.275
Yes, I just found out.

30:06.287 --> 30:10.991
I never expected Leung Jan to get involved.

30:11.953 --> 30:14.239
It doesn't look like it.

30:14.328 --> 30:19.448
If Leung Jan wanted to get involved,
he would do something.

30:20.287 --> 30:25.323
Anyway, Leung Jan is a nuisance to us.

30:31.037 --> 30:34.284
Let's show him who's in charge.

30:47.913 --> 30:49.904
Master Jan.

30:51.246 --> 30:53.320
Master Jan, I've not eaten for two days.

30:55.122 --> 30:57.112
Thank you.

31:06.455 --> 31:10.151
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31:22.915 --> 31:25.450
Good morning, Master Jan.

31:26.748 --> 31:30.576
What a coincidence. Please, join me.

31:37.207 --> 31:39.363
- I'll do it myself.
- Fine.

31:39.456 --> 31:41.531
Please have some tea.

31:48.082 --> 31:51.945
Master Jan, we are here specially for you.

31:52.040 --> 31:56.449
What can I do for you?

31:56.540 --> 31:59.455
A simple task, give us our man.

31:59.541 --> 32:00.785
Your man?

32:00.874 --> 32:04.821
Cashier Wah is of no use to you.

32:04.917 --> 32:08.862
You two have misunderstood.
I haven't sheltered Cashier Wah.

32:08.958 --> 32:12.158
He's just another of my patients.

32:12.249 --> 32:15.946
I've no intention of getting involved
between you and him.

32:16.041 --> 32:21.825
Until he's fully recovered,
he'll remain in my establishment.

32:21.917 --> 32:24.405
That's my responsibility.

32:24.500 --> 32:28.079
Trade him with your own life then.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.667
Stop it!

33:28.503 --> 33:31.915
Who are you?
How dare you start trouble here?

33:36.920 --> 33:39.870
These guys obey you.
You can't be good.

33:41.419 --> 33:45.662
Master Jan, how did you
get mixed up with these people?

33:45.752 --> 33:49.368
I must have offended them
when I was much younger.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.334
- Ah Mao!
- Yes.

33:52.338 --> 33:54.624
I'll pay for the damage.

33:56.379 --> 33:58.121
You don't have to.

33:58.213 --> 34:00.997
Thank you, Master Jan.

34:02.337 --> 34:06.000
- Boss Mok, I have to go now.
- Please.

34:14.546 --> 34:15.659
Herbs Encyclopedia

34:21.047 --> 34:26.000
Cashier Wah, I don't know what
dispute you have with those people.

34:27.129 --> 34:29.334
And I don't wish to know.

34:30.797 --> 34:35.206
Since you've fully recovered,
you can go now.

34:37.714 --> 34:40.877
Master Jan, why won't you adopt me?

34:41.589 --> 34:46.744
You want me to adopt you
as my student only for revenge.

34:46.839 --> 34:50.915
To learn Kung Fu for revenge
is against the principle.

34:51.006 --> 34:53.874
- Master Jan, those are bad people.
- Enough.

34:53.965 --> 34:58.290
To settle any dispute,
one party has to give in first.

34:58.381 --> 35:01.462
That's the only way to avoid bloodshed.

35:01.547 --> 35:06.585
Cashier Wah, you can go now,
I won't take you as my student.

35:16.257 --> 35:18.579
- Sifu.
- Sifu.

35:25.716 --> 35:27.375
Thank you.

35:28.549 --> 35:32.081
Sifu, is Cashier Wah
still kneeling in the study?

35:38.299 --> 35:40.966
- Third Uncle...
- How many times have I told you?

35:41.050 --> 35:43.502
No talking when you are eating.

35:52.092 --> 35:57.543
Sifu, I know.
No talking when I'm eating.

36:06.343 --> 36:10.005
Come on, please take a seat first.

36:18.467 --> 36:20.505
Don't choke yourself.

36:20.593 --> 36:25.214
Fatty, your idea didn't work.
If I kneel any longer, I'll be paralyzed.

36:27.636 --> 36:30.586
Sifu is a very conservative man.

36:30.677 --> 36:34.753
What should I do now?
Should I kneel or should I go?

36:37.428 --> 36:38.968
What next?

36:39.052 --> 36:42.004
I'm thinking about it.

36:46.677 --> 36:49.628
Third Uncle, have some tea, please.

36:52.386 --> 36:55.384
Kam Fung, has Cashier Wah left?

36:55.469 --> 36:59.629
No, but he's found another Sifu.

37:02.719 --> 37:04.046
Another Sifu?

37:10.346 --> 37:12.585
- Sifu's here, get ready.
- OK.

37:12.679 --> 37:14.716
Kneel down, kneel down.

37:28.012 --> 37:30.417
Little Sifu, have some tea, please.

37:40.346 --> 37:42.384
Fatty, what are you doing?

37:43.305 --> 37:47.513
Since you rejected him as a student,
I've decided to teach him myself.

37:47.597 --> 37:50.132
Now he is to call me Sifu.

37:55.681 --> 37:57.636
- Student.
- Here.

37:57.723 --> 37:59.796
- On your feet.
- Yes.

38:01.514 --> 38:04.464
I'll teach you some basics.

38:06.681 --> 38:09.299
Little Sifu, why are you not
using your hands?

38:09.389 --> 38:12.671
- This is the Handless style.
- What stance is this?

38:12.764 --> 38:15.548
This is the Two Gangsters stance.

38:19.180 --> 38:21.054
Push your bum forward.

38:22.682 --> 38:24.258
What's the function of this.

38:24.349 --> 38:27.512
Wing Chun practitioners' way
of healing piles.

38:27.598 --> 38:30.170
Is this Wing Chun style?

38:30.265 --> 38:33.631
Why do you care? Just do what I say.

38:39.891 --> 38:43.671
In Wing Chun, our hand
has to look like Snake or Crane...

38:44.766 --> 38:47.336
Why is your Crane slanted?

38:48.224 --> 38:50.759
This is the Slanted Crane from Wing Chun.

38:50.849 --> 38:51.963
Hand block.

38:52.058 --> 38:55.505
Left block, right block, big block.

38:55.599 --> 38:56.973
Last block, done.

38:58.808 --> 39:02.008
Why are you keeping
the blocks in your pocket?

39:02.100 --> 39:07.338
We have so many blocks,
where else can you keep them?

39:09.308 --> 39:10.967
That makes sense.

39:12.809 --> 39:17.217
In Wing Chun, we go over the bridge,
not under it. Show me your hand.

39:19.016 --> 39:21.802
- What if there's no bridge?
- No bridge?

39:25.017 --> 39:27.139
Build one yourself, stupid.

39:27.226 --> 39:29.382
Build a bridge?

39:29.475 --> 39:31.301
How do I do that?

39:33.225 --> 39:35.346
What does this look like?

39:35.434 --> 39:39.013
- A bridge.
- Yes, it's more like a bridge than a tunnel.

39:44.894 --> 39:47.346
Do you understand now?

39:47.435 --> 39:51.096
Let's have a sparring match.
We'll see whose style is better.

39:51.184 --> 39:54.634
But I warn you that Wing Chun
is unbeatable, you can't touch me.

39:54.727 --> 39:56.966
This is Cultivating Hand.

39:57.060 --> 39:59.810
This is Twisted Hand. The next is...

40:03.894 --> 40:06.014
Little Sifu, what's the next move?

40:06.101 --> 40:08.307
Back arch... It hurts!

40:09.395 --> 40:11.219
Watch out again.

40:21.144 --> 40:25.388
- Sifu...
- You are a disgrace to Wing Chun.

40:31.103 --> 40:33.094
Here, come on.

40:46.270 --> 40:48.177
He will adopt you as his student.

40:48.270 --> 40:50.557
Quick, serve Sifu some tea.

40:50.645 --> 40:52.683
Sifu.

41:12.563 --> 41:16.971
Abbess Ng Mui developed Wing Chun
after witnessing a snake and a crane fight.

41:17.063 --> 41:19.469
She later refined it to three routines.

41:19.564 --> 41:21.968
The first routine is Little Ideas.

41:49.523 --> 41:51.395
Why is it called Little Ideas?

41:51.481 --> 41:54.682
Sifu doubts that we will learn
the whole system of Wing Chun,

41:54.774 --> 41:58.435
so he won't teach us Big Thoughts,
he will only give us Little Ideas.

41:58.523 --> 42:00.561
Hence the term Little Ideas.

42:02.232 --> 42:04.269
Stay focused!

42:06.315 --> 42:10.013
Hey! We've learnt this before.

42:10.107 --> 42:14.102
- Let's practice somewhere else.
- Good idea.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.806
Searching the Bridge.

42:27.066 --> 42:28.808
Darting Fingers.

42:39.192 --> 42:43.138
Our moves come from the heart,
our strength from the ground.

42:43.234 --> 42:45.638
The Six in One Move is from your

42:45.733 --> 42:46.895
ankle,

42:46.983 --> 42:48.263
knee,

42:48.359 --> 42:49.767
waist,

42:49.858 --> 42:51.185
shoulder,

42:51.275 --> 42:53.102
elbow and wrist.

42:53.194 --> 42:56.890
Strength from the six points
merge to form the Six in One Move.

42:56.985 --> 42:59.188
The weakest part is your fist.

42:59.276 --> 43:03.140
Other parts, like your palm,
elbow and shoulder,

43:03.235 --> 43:07.809
could be attacked and defended.

43:07.901 --> 43:12.061
The fist has three points.
Two points are here, watch.

43:13.693 --> 43:15.316
The palm has three angles.

43:25.611 --> 43:27.814
Palm should be flexible.

43:27.902 --> 43:30.106
Hand can be snake or crane.

43:30.194 --> 43:34.140
The form resembles a chicken,
the force resembles a cat.

43:40.737 --> 43:43.355
The energy should be
directed at the enemy.

43:49.820 --> 43:54.442
Expend your energy only when necessary.

44:00.653 --> 44:05.855
I'm teaching you the most fundamental
technique of Wing Chun, Separate Hand.

44:05.944 --> 44:07.651
Attack me.

44:16.196 --> 44:18.353
This is Deadly Slap.

44:20.237 --> 44:22.027
Dispersing Attack.

44:24.696 --> 44:26.936
Winged Arm Darting Punch.

44:32.904 --> 44:34.397
Controlling Arm.

44:34.488 --> 44:36.526
Subdue Head, Rattle Tail.

44:39.697 --> 44:43.441
Divert the attack, Linking Fast Palms.

44:44.905 --> 44:46.612
Come again.

44:51.031 --> 44:53.104
Cultivating Hand.

44:55.532 --> 44:57.569
This is the Fiery Dragon.

45:00.573 --> 45:02.610
Follow me.

45:10.990 --> 45:13.027
Show me two fingers.

45:14.365 --> 45:16.485
When I let go, catch it.

45:20.656 --> 45:22.860
Pick it up.

45:22.948 --> 45:24.986
Let's try again.

45:31.991 --> 45:34.313
Do you know why you can't catch it?

45:35.907 --> 45:39.487
Your eyes see it and alert the brain

45:39.575 --> 45:43.402
before signaling your fingers to catch -
all this takes too long.

45:43.491 --> 45:46.939
That's why in Wing Chun
there's a technique called Sticky Hand.

45:47.033 --> 45:49.865
Sticky Hand trains the sensitivity
of your hand.

45:51.366 --> 45:54.946
It also allows you
to apply force appropriately.

45:55.033 --> 45:56.692
Do you understand?

46:02.449 --> 46:04.606
- Fatty.
- Yes, Sifu.

46:04.700 --> 46:06.737
Practice with him.

46:32.826 --> 46:35.396
Just now you are using Impetus Power.

46:36.367 --> 46:39.649
Impetus Power combined with
Directional Power

46:39.742 --> 46:43.868
will result in a momentous explosive force.

46:43.952 --> 46:46.488
This is the power of combined force.

46:46.577 --> 46:49.244
Sifu, what if the enemy uses his legs?

46:49.327 --> 46:51.234
You try.

46:53.494 --> 46:55.699
Use your arms to block high kicks.

46:59.661 --> 47:03.441
Use your legs to negate the low kicks.
Do you understand?

47:49.371 --> 47:50.449
Vengeance

47:50.537 --> 47:54.117
Cashier Wah, I'll teach you
the secrets of Wing Chun,

47:54.204 --> 47:57.405
I hope that you'll pass it on.

48:00.704 --> 48:03.739
Sifu, I won't disappoint you.

48:16.956 --> 48:18.662
Block it.

48:56.166 --> 48:59.947
You must use the fastest time
and the shortest contact

49:00.041 --> 49:03.074
to get these two dummies
back to their place.

49:49.084 --> 49:50.743
Sifu.

49:54.501 --> 49:58.958
You can't even control two dummies.

49:59.044 --> 50:02.207
If I were your third enemy,
you would be dead.

50:10.460 --> 50:13.128
Start from the top.

50:47.462 --> 50:52.166
With your skill you can defeat
more than two dummies.

50:52.254 --> 50:57.588
Your problem is that you can't concentrate.

50:57.671 --> 51:00.871
When you enter this dummy corridor

51:00.963 --> 51:03.248
you only have one thing in mind.

51:03.337 --> 51:04.332
Vengeance

53:11.676 --> 53:15.007
Fatty has improved so much.
He's been scoring.

54:00.971 --> 54:03.044
Sifu, he's...

54:05.970 --> 54:08.885
Every martial art practitioner
has weaknesses.

54:08.970 --> 54:13.675
Even someone who has mastered
the Invincible Armor technique.

54:13.762 --> 54:16.333
The most common weak points are,

54:17.137 --> 54:19.840
the eyes and the groin.

54:20.678 --> 54:24.719
To attack the weak points
is not an easy task.

54:24.803 --> 54:28.965
The human body
has 108 basic pressure points.

54:29.056 --> 54:31.839
The Invincible Armor
technique won't change this.

54:31.930 --> 54:35.212
The points are consistently
around the same area.

54:36.763 --> 54:40.342
The Invincible Armor
is not hurt by a normal punch.

54:40.429 --> 54:42.965
But would be hurt by an impetus punch.

54:44.889 --> 54:50.968
As long as you disturb his energy flow,
you have a chance to attack his weak points.

54:51.055 --> 54:55.712
The weakest points with
the biggest surface area are

54:55.805 --> 54:59.716
the feet and the side of the feet.

54:59.806 --> 55:04.925
Now, I'll teach you the Wing Chun
Six and a Half points Pole.

55:05.014 --> 55:07.763
First point, Twins on a Flute.

55:10.473 --> 55:13.968
Second point, Falling Sky.
Third point, Deadly Ground.

55:17.223 --> 55:19.546
Fourth Point, Monkey Stealing Peach.

55:19.640 --> 55:22.306
Left Block, Right Bloom.

55:27.764 --> 55:30.432
Beauty Rowing a Raft, only half a point.

55:30.515 --> 55:35.468
Put together it becomes
Six and a Half points Pole.

55:35.556 --> 55:40.925
The most difficult parts of this technique
are stabbing and dispersing.

55:41.015 --> 55:45.839
It's about the way you disperse
your energy to the tip of the pole.

55:45.933 --> 55:48.387
The pole has elasticity.

55:48.475 --> 55:52.515
Our aim is to combine its elasticity
with our applied force effectively.

55:52.600 --> 55:56.593
Now, I want you to crush this olive stone.

56:47.893 --> 56:51.969
You didn't combine
all your energy effectively.

56:52.060 --> 56:55.093
You are only able to push the stone aside.

56:56.726 --> 56:59.096
Try again.

57:23.020 --> 57:24.726
Sifu.

57:24.811 --> 57:27.478
Practice makes perfect.

57:27.561 --> 57:30.726
No pain, no gain.

57:30.812 --> 57:33.430
You should know the philosophy.

57:33.520 --> 57:37.513
Don't worry.
Pick up all the olive stones now.

57:37.603 --> 57:39.641
Try again.

57:56.937 --> 57:59.261
Don't stop.

58:07.063 --> 58:08.888
Sifu, I'm...

58:10.271 --> 58:12.724
Your target is never stationary.

58:12.813 --> 58:18.099
If you respond only to your opponent's move,
it's already too late.

58:18.189 --> 58:22.728
You have to reach the stage
when you hit whatever you see.

58:45.272 --> 58:47.063
Try again.

59:12.524 --> 59:16.732
I'm not worried about Cashier Wah.

59:16.816 --> 59:20.017
It's Leung Jan that I'm wary of.

59:21.233 --> 59:25.605
- Master Jan won't compete with you.
- I know.

59:25.691 --> 59:30.147
But he's sheltering Cashier Wah.

59:31.733 --> 59:34.483
He might cause a problem in the future.

59:34.567 --> 59:38.810
Master Jan is not a simple man.

59:43.818 --> 59:49.517
- Mister Yao, everyone has a habit.
- That's true.

59:49.609 --> 59:52.773
- Habits mean weaknesses.
- True.

59:52.860 --> 59:58.227
He might be very skilful but he's still human.

1:00:08.859 --> 1:00:10.731
Master Jan.

1:00:10.818 --> 1:00:12.974
What's happening?

1:00:13.067 --> 1:00:16.565
We are having renovations done,
please sit upstairs.

1:00:21.403 --> 1:00:23.440
Master Jan, please be seated.

1:00:58.862 --> 1:01:00.438
Master Jan.

1:01:01.320 --> 1:01:03.857
I'm very hungry.

1:01:16.321 --> 1:01:17.696
You...

1:02:35.324 --> 1:02:41.238
I've not offended you
so why are you attacking me?

1:02:41.324 --> 1:02:45.021
Killing you will get rid of
a pain in my backside.

1:05:28.998 --> 1:05:31.404
Third Uncle, Third Uncle!

1:05:33.456 --> 1:05:34.915
Stop it.

1:05:36.998 --> 1:05:39.452
You will die together now.

1:06:16.083 --> 1:06:19.365
- Junior, even Sifu lost to them.
- What should we do?

1:06:19.458 --> 1:06:21.450
- Go with Cashier Wah.
- And you?

1:06:21.542 --> 1:06:23.035
I'll take care of myself.

1:07:03.710 --> 1:07:05.784
He's escaped.

1:07:10.752 --> 1:07:14.248
Stupid Fatty,
not happy with the way you died?

1:08:01.380 --> 1:08:03.085
It's Fatty.

1:08:06.005 --> 1:08:09.086
- What have you found out.
- What happened?

1:08:09.172 --> 1:08:11.376
Mok has become the Village Head.

1:08:11.464 --> 1:08:14.130
- He's taken over the village office?
- Yes.

1:08:14.213 --> 1:08:16.333
Where are his accomplices?

1:08:20.463 --> 1:08:22.999
Let me think.

1:08:23.089 --> 1:08:24.996
I know.

1:08:25.089 --> 1:08:27.493
We'll have to attack them separately.

1:08:27.588 --> 1:08:28.998
Kam Fung.

1:08:29.089 --> 1:08:33.129
Use the Eight Slashing Knife
to counter Tiger's Long Spear.

1:08:36.297 --> 1:08:40.671
Fatty, use your Sticky Hand
to counter Thunder's technique.

1:08:41.923 --> 1:08:47.160
I'll use my Six and a Half Point Pole
against Iron Fist.

1:08:54.590 --> 1:08:56.627
Let's do it tonight.

1:09:15.465 --> 1:09:17.007
I have to go.

1:09:17.091 --> 1:09:19.247
- No don't go.
- It's getting late.

1:09:19.341 --> 1:09:21.961
- I'll come tomorrow night.
- Master.

1:09:26.924 --> 1:09:28.962
Please come again.

1:09:33.799 --> 1:09:34.913
Thunder.

1:09:37.258 --> 1:09:38.881
You!

1:09:38.967 --> 1:09:43.920
I'm Tiger, Thunder wouldn't visit
such a place.

1:09:48.008 --> 1:09:51.290
Shit. I've got the names mixed up.

1:09:51.383 --> 1:09:54.003
I'm in big trouble.

1:11:47.804 --> 1:11:49.178
Bamboo.

1:11:53.181 --> 1:11:54.887
Bamboo forest.

1:12:02.597 --> 1:12:06.093
Kam Fung, help me. He's here.

1:12:07.180 --> 1:12:10.594
It's no use. Get ready to see your dead Sifu.

1:15:16.272 --> 1:15:18.228
Your hand got stuck to mine.

1:15:35.856 --> 1:15:37.892
Sifu...

1:15:58.274 --> 1:16:00.312
Why did you die so easily?

1:16:01.773 --> 1:16:03.930
Are you really dead?

1:16:04.024 --> 1:16:06.310
I'm talking to you. Are you dead?

1:16:08.190 --> 1:16:10.229
You're really dead.

1:16:13.941 --> 1:16:19.440
If I see you down below,
I'll kill you again and again.

1:16:25.109 --> 1:16:28.060
Stupid Fatty mixed up the names.

1:16:28.151 --> 1:16:30.390
I wonder how Fatty is doing?

1:19:41.951 --> 1:19:43.491
What's happening?

1:19:43.575 --> 1:19:46.692
We have intruders.
You two take care of them.

1:19:46.784 --> 1:19:48.821
I'll go and get Boss Mok.

1:21:35.412 --> 1:21:37.783
Kam Fung, why couldn't you last longer?

1:23:26.334 --> 1:23:28.454
I give up.

1:23:35.626 --> 1:23:37.830
Does Boss Mok know Kung Fu?

1:23:37.917 --> 1:23:40.916
You're asking me?
How should I know?

1:23:42.042 --> 1:23:44.366
I think I can take on the Fatty.

1:23:46.584 --> 1:23:48.042
You.

1:23:49.751 --> 1:23:51.208
Yes.

1:23:54.835 --> 1:23:56.576
Come on.

1:24:32.878 --> 1:24:36.623
Stupid Fatty, went for my weaker leg.

1:24:56.046 --> 1:24:57.917
No, I'll do it myself.

1:25:29.922 --> 1:25:31.546
Praying mantis.

1:26:02.175 --> 1:26:04.544
Left, right, left, die.

1:26:10.299 --> 1:26:12.538
- What's wrong?
- Cramps.

1:26:15.133 --> 1:26:16.957
Much better.

1:26:26.590 --> 1:26:28.462
Where is he?

1:26:40.758 --> 1:26:44.171
Why is your head so hard?

1:26:44.384 --> 1:26:46.873
There's a plate on top.

1:26:46.968 --> 1:26:50.415
Should have kept you guessing.

1:26:50.509 --> 1:26:53.080
I'll pretend I don't know.

1:26:54.800 --> 1:26:56.542
Take that.

1:27:14.425 --> 1:27:19.250
- Why can't you feel that?
- That's my numb and useless leg.

1:27:35.636 --> 1:27:39.215
- Are you going to let me through?
- Yes, of course.

1:27:39.302 --> 1:27:41.376
Smart move.

1:27:59.970 --> 1:28:02.210
Let me down!

1:28:02.304 --> 1:28:04.094
Do you like it?

1:28:04.179 --> 1:28:06.502
I have a child and a wife, let me go!

1:28:13.304 --> 1:28:15.543
Let me down!

1:28:31.054 --> 1:28:32.548
Stupid Fatty.

1:28:49.514 --> 1:28:52.002
Thank you.

1:28:52.097 --> 1:28:54.088
Thanks a lot.

1:28:54.180 --> 1:28:56.218
You peed yourself.

1:28:56.972 --> 1:28:58.844
I know.

1:29:47.766 --> 1:29:49.591
This is Praying Mantis Grip.

1:29:52.601 --> 1:29:54.839
This is Fat Bird Pecking.

1:31:40.479 --> 1:31:42.516
Fatty, are you all right?

1:31:43.854 --> 1:31:46.851
I'm all right. Let's beat him together.

1:31:46.936 --> 1:31:49.937
- How?
- I'll take his blows, you hit him.

1:31:50.022 --> 1:31:53.719
- OK.
- I'm willing to die.

1:32:14.771 --> 1:32:16.478
Hit his head.

1:33:19.442 --> 1:33:22.274
Don't worry about me. Kill him.

1:34:18.485 --> 1:34:20.192
I'm falling.

1:34:27.194 --> 1:34:29.232
Fatty, are you all right?

1:34:30.986 --> 1:34:34.067
- Can you stand?
- I'm not dead yet.

1:34:34.153 --> 1:34:36.902
- Can you walk?
- No, you had better...

1:34:36.987 --> 1:34:39.191
You want me to carry you?

1:34:39.279 --> 1:34:41.683
No, I'll crawl out of here.

1:34:41.778 --> 1:34:43.899
Let's go, then.
