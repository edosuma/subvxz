WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:06.454
Dragon:
In a land of myth and a time of magic...

00:06.632 --> 00:08.122
The destiny of a great kingdom...

00:08.300 --> 00:10.837
Rests on the shoulders
of a young man.

00:11.261 --> 00:14.503
His name: Merlin.

00:17.142 --> 00:20.350
The prophets speak of Arthur's bane.

00:20.938 --> 00:22.929
You would do well to fear it.

00:23.106 --> 00:26.690
For it stalks him
like a ghost in the night.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.549
Ruadan: Arthur's bane is
real once it is known to us.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.655
- His end is nigh.
- So you keep saying.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.734
- Yet you cannot tell me what it is.
- The diamair will tell us.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.743
The diamair is the key
to all knowledge.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.529
Then where is this key?

00:42.042 --> 00:43.828
It is here beneath your feet.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.955
There's something out there.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.786
- Did you see that?
- I'm not sure we should go to ismere.

00:49.091 --> 00:51.207
Arthur:
I swear I'm going to rescue my men...

00:51.385 --> 00:52.545
Or die trying.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.633
Merlin!

01:01.353 --> 01:03.093
- Not so fast.
- Stop!

01:03.438 --> 01:06.475
Shouldn't we leave it to the lady morgana
to decide their fate?

01:06.984 --> 01:08.849
- Mordred.
- Hello, Arthur.

02:21.433 --> 02:22.639
Aithusa?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.222
Come.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.850
Come here.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.695
Don't worry.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.566
We're safe.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.819
No harm can come to us now.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.661
Our troubles are
all in the past.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.369
I promise.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.470
Soon we will have the diamair.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.349
Soon we will know Arthur's bane.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.932
Camelot will be ours.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.234
Arthur: Remind me, Merlin...

03:20.409 --> 03:22.070
How did we end up like this?

03:22.869 --> 03:26.453
Oh, yes, you were thinking
about your stomach as usual.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.075
I told you it was a trap.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.833
Merlin! Man: Hold!

03:37.217 --> 03:40.960
We can't let them hand us over to morgana.
We need to get out of here. We need a plan.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.304
You speak when you're spoken to.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.507
Faster.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.661
Here

04:09.666 --> 04:10.746
- drink this.
- No.

04:10.917 --> 04:14.501
- It will make it easier to bear.
- No, Gaius, you have to help me.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.336
Please, speak to the queen.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.212
- It will do no good.
- Then let me.

04:19.634 --> 04:22.467
Please, it's all I ask.
Allow me to meet with her.

04:22.637 --> 04:25.253
- I'm just a physician.
- But she listens to you.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.549
She trusts you.
Please, all I want is to talk with her.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.134
If you don't help me, Gaius...

04:31.938 --> 04:33.144
Please don't let me die.

04:33.482 --> 04:34.642
Please.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.251
What are you gawping at?

05:02.427 --> 05:04.008
Is this what you want?

05:08.183 --> 05:09.423
Catch.

05:13.605 --> 05:14.965
Mordred:
Maybe we should feed them.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.346
What for?

05:16.566 --> 05:19.433
- They'll be skin and bones.
- Morgana wants slaves...

05:19.694 --> 05:21.480
Not hogs for the fire.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.611
Then slow the pace.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.530
The quicker we get there...

05:26.785 --> 05:28.070
The quicker I get my money.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.690
- Do you want them?
- Why are you doing this?

06:44.946 --> 06:46.277
He once saved my life.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.480
I owe him a debt.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.982
Don't be so quick to judge me.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.615
You fear me, emrys. Don't you?

07:00.420 --> 07:04.629
I know the hatred and suspicion
with which men treat those with magic.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.591
You and I are not so different.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.421
L, too, have learned to hide my gifts.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.556
I promise your secret
is safe with me.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.352
What's morgana looking for in ismere”?

07:31.409 --> 07:32.409
The diamair.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.659
What's that?

07:35.163 --> 07:37.495
In the language of my people,
it means "the key."

07:38.041 --> 07:39.247
The key to what?

07:40.502 --> 07:42.367
The key to all knowledge.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.392
There is still no sign of the diamar.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.228
We're running out of time!

08:02.732 --> 08:04.268
Have faith, morgana.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.023
Arthur could be on us in days.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.482
- Or he could be dead.
- No, he escaped. I'm sure of it.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.320
He'll be in Camelot by now.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.491
Then you must speak to your spy and
discover what Arthur intends to do next!

08:14.661 --> 08:15.992
Milady...

08:17.539 --> 08:19.120
Sefa has been arrested.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.205
She is sentenced to die.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.965
That is cruel indeed

08:36.725 --> 08:39.010
You must remember
there is no greater glory...

08:39.227 --> 08:41.388
Than giving your life
for a cause that is right.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.142
She has proved herself
to be a worthy daughter.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.276
It will not be forgotten.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.358
I will double the patrols on the border.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.070
We will be ready
for when Arthur returns.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.867
There is nothing more
you can do for sefa.

09:03.334 --> 09:06.326
We must make sure
her sacrifice was not in vain.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.898
Whoa! Stop!

09:30.820 --> 09:31.980
He needs water.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.988
Get up.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.496
Not so much
of the great warrior now...

09:50.673 --> 09:52.789
Are you? Ha, ha, hal

09:52.967 --> 09:54.002
Merlin: Here

09:55.095 --> 09:56.676
I'll help him.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.136
(Gol

10:20.745 --> 10:23.452
- Milady.
- Sefa.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.405
You asked to see me.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.786
I'm sorry for what I did.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.126
It was wrong, I know.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.582
It was without thinking.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.924
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
I wouldn't. I...

10:36.928 --> 10:39.419
All I wanted was to help my father.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.013
And now I'm condemned to death.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.764
Gwen:
You understand the law, sefa.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.058
I cannot change it. Please

10:46.521 --> 10:48.261
I know you have a good heart.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.813
A reprieve... I'm begging you.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.733
- Men have died.
- I know.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.858
I'm sorry. I'm s...

10:58.116 --> 10:59.401
I'm so sorry.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.698
It was the only thing
he wanted from me.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.165
I told him I couldn't, but...

11:10.420 --> 11:11.956
I don't know. He...

11:13.381 --> 11:15.417
I wanted to make him happy...

11:16.176 --> 11:17.461
To please him.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.717
- He used you.
- I know.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.761
Milady, I don't want to die.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.387
There's nothing I can do, sefa.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.845
- The sentence stands.
- Milady.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.525
Where is it I need to sign?

11:46.331 --> 11:48.617
Perhaps you should reconsider.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.076
That sentence is a harsh one.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.543
- The law is clear.
- Sefa was naive and foolish

11:53.713 --> 11:55.328
but she doesn't deserve to die.

11:56.633 --> 12:00.501
And she won't, Gaius.
I have no intention of executing her.

12:01.596 --> 12:02.836
My aim is to catch her father.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.300
He is the threat to Camelot,
not the girl.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.133
I'm hoping her plight
will lure him here.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.718
Why did you not tell me this?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.727
Her predicament must remain genuine.

12:11.940 --> 12:15.228
If ruadan has one spy in Camelot,
he may have others.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.892
And if he has any inkling
of this, he will not come.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.437
It's a dangerous game
you're playing, my lady.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.822
Wars cannot be won
without taking risks, Gaius.

12:23.034 --> 12:26.652
The execution is set.
What happens if ruadan doesn't appear?

12:27.705 --> 12:31.539
Sefa is his daughter.
I have to believe that he will

12:49.560 --> 12:51.050
Who did this?

12:52.480 --> 12:53.560
Who?!

12:55.358 --> 12:56.689
We need to rest

13:00.697 --> 13:02.904
right. You can rest...

13:03.199 --> 13:04.439
Forever.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.501
Arthur: Run! Run!

13:34.772 --> 13:37.184
- You've got to be joking.
- Do you have a better solution?

13:51.914 --> 13:53.870
We haven't got all day, Merlin.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.394
- I'll make sure they can't get across.
- Right!

15:00.525 --> 15:02.061
Why did you spare his life?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.715
- He couldn't come after us.
- He was leading us to our deaths!

15:04.779 --> 15:06.819
He showed us kindness.
You should have killed him!

15:06.864 --> 15:09.571
What is wrong with you?
You had the chance

15:09.784 --> 15:11.024
we escaped, didn't we?

15:12.495 --> 15:14.201
Next time we might not be so lucky.

15:14.372 --> 15:18.240
I love your optimism.
Come on, we need to keep moving.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.385
You have nothing to fear.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.935
Your wounds are not yet healed.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.017
You.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.182
You saved me.

15:45.111 --> 15:50.606
- Thank you.
- I know that you are worthy of my help.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.783
I don't understand.
You think kindness.

15:53.995 --> 15:57.158
Is the preserve of humans?

15:59.834 --> 16:02.120
I've never seen a creature
like you before.

16:02.545 --> 16:03.705
No

16:04.088 --> 16:05.419
Who are you?

16:05.631 --> 16:12.423
I have been called many things
by the children of men.

16:13.431 --> 16:16.673
I am the last of my kind.

16:17.643 --> 16:21.761
Once we were revered by all.

16:22.565 --> 16:26.729
But those days are long gone.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.023
For hundreds of years, we were shunned...

16:30.198 --> 16:34.532
And hunted till I found myself...

16:34.785 --> 16:36.901
Alone.

16:37.330 --> 16:41.664
And now, even this last refuge...

16:42.210 --> 16:45.623
1s safe no more.

16:54.764 --> 16:58.473
You are weak, fair knight.

16:59.268 --> 17:05.012
You must rest, and heal yourself.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.126
Stop.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.098
Reveal yourself.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.473
Come on.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.576
- Is it ruadan?
- Leon: Most certainly.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.597
There!

19:50.773 --> 19:52.229
Give yourselves up.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.557
There's no escape.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.053
Father!

21:04.764 --> 21:06.004
I need water.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.573
- Father.
- The fight must continue.

21:26.744 --> 21:29.110
- You must cure yourself.
- I do not have such powers.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.869
Try, please.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.092
Attach this to the bird.

22:08.536 --> 22:09.867
You've done very well.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.070
You should be proud.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.744
Sefa.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.921
- You can't leave me.
- You must be strong.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.502
Feather, please.

22:27.263 --> 22:29.219
I will always love you.

23:22.693 --> 23:24.479
Ruadan: I bring bad tidings.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.902
Arthur did not return to Camelot.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.979
He makes his way to ismere.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.611
But you must not despair, morgana.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.442
Soon you will have the diamair...

23:33.621 --> 23:36.283
And Arthur's bane will be in your grasp.

23:36.582 --> 23:39.574
Soon the pendragons will be no more.

23:43.881 --> 23:46.167
Arthur:
You know what they say, Merlin:

23:46.800 --> 23:48.961
Appearances can be deceiving.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.048
Not in this case.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.150
Gwen: What is it?

24:12.826 --> 24:15.408
I believe it's a prayer.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.338
Gwen: Can you read it?

24:30.719 --> 24:31.719
(Gaius?

24:31.887 --> 24:34.879
I'm no expert in the druidic runes.

24:35.057 --> 24:38.015
Please. I know you too well.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.432
It's a call for victory over the enemies
of the old religion.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.310
I thought the druids
were a peaceful people.

24:46.568 --> 24:47.808
For the most part, they are.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.103
But for some,
the great purge changed that.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.362
They blame uther for their suffering.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.106
But he's long been dead.

24:54.284 --> 24:57.151
Some believe that Arthur
is no different from his father.

24:57.371 --> 24:58.986
Sorcery is still outlawed.

24:59.206 --> 25:01.868
For them, little has changed.

25:02.876 --> 25:05.993
So ruadan believed it was his
sacred duty to fight my husband.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.662
More than that,
there are those who believe

25:08.882 --> 25:12.124
that Arthur is destined
to die by a druid's hand.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.219
Perhaps ruadan thought
he was that man.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.885
Well, then he was mistaken.

25:36.827 --> 25:40.160
I told you you should've killed him
when you had the chance.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.999
We'll never make it in there.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.501
There's always a way, Merlin.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.890
How did you talk me into this?

26:02.102 --> 26:03.433
Genius, Merlin.

26:08.776 --> 26:10.186
(Senius?

26:11.070 --> 26:12.981
You have a bit of, um...

26:13.405 --> 26:15.145
Carrot in your hair.

26:16.158 --> 26:17.773
At least I hope it's carrot.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.546
Arthur: Ready? Merlin: For what?

26:41.433 --> 26:43.424
Our carriage awaits.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.305
Come on!

27:13.006 --> 27:14.871
Merlin:
The place is crawling with saxons.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.507
Arthur:
We'd better make sure we blend in.

27:17.678 --> 27:18.758
Arthur.

27:18.929 --> 27:22.217
Man:
Let the lady morgana see for herself.

27:25.853 --> 27:28.640
I'll get twice that
at the market at asgorath.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.650
It

27:45.956 --> 27:48.789
My lady, I am grateful
for this opportunity.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.701
I have brought you eight of the finest...

28:07.603 --> 28:09.343
Mordred.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.900
- Arthur.
- Didn't think we'd just leave you here, did you?

28:21.074 --> 28:23.406
- Where are the others?
- They're, uh...

28:23.827 --> 28:25.158
Gcattered around.

28:25.329 --> 28:28.492
- Gwaine?
- Saw him a couple of days ago, but...

28:31.668 --> 28:34.751
See if you can use it to find some more.
“Arthur.

28:36.715 --> 28:40.173
Do what you can to free the others.
We'll find Gwaine.

29:04.660 --> 29:05.695
Come here.

29:22.636 --> 29:23.921
I feared you were dead.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.256
It's dangerous
for those of us with magic.

29:29.977 --> 29:31.592
It's not been easy.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.060
For any of us.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.723
Sorcery frightens people.

29:40.070 --> 29:42.026
Even some of those
who claim to support it.

29:42.656 --> 29:43.816
You see 3 lot

29:44.658 --> 29:46.114
I've learned too.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.864
I have had to.

29:51.540 --> 29:55.499
If I was not to be burned at the stake
or exploited for another man's gain.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.576
Attitudes will change soon.

29:58.422 --> 30:00.663
The old religion
will reign once more.

30:00.841 --> 30:04.129
There'll be nothing to fear once Arthur
and his kind are cleansed from the earth.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.217
You know, we had Arthur in our grasp.

30:15.689 --> 30:16.895
He escaped.

30:20.694 --> 30:21.854
You let him go?

30:23.030 --> 30:25.237
- He got away.
- How?

30:26.366 --> 30:27.446
Who let him go?

30:28.493 --> 30:30.233
It was an accident. Kill him!

30:30.412 --> 30:32.528
That's all they had to do!

30:32.789 --> 30:34.726
- I'm a high priestess. I have the power...
- Morgana.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.602
O0f the heavens in my hand,
and yet he continues to defy me!

30:36.626 --> 30:37.832
Calm yourself.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.664
I want his annihilation, mordred.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.454
I want to put his head on a spike
and I want to watch

30:42.632 --> 30:44.372
as the crows feast on his eyes.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.845
Arthur.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.397
You must wake.

31:04.613 --> 31:05.944
What is that?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.234
The warning bell.

31:09.409 --> 31:10.990
Where are they coming from?

31:29.554 --> 31:31.761
Don't worry.
No one's gonna harm you.

31:42.442 --> 31:44.307
Trust you not to be doing any work.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.226
It's about time.

31:49.324 --> 31:52.657
Gwaine:
We're friends. Good friends.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.387
What was that?

32:17.144 --> 32:18.759
Not exactly sure.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.891
But I owe it my life.

33:18.079 --> 33:21.412
Something's wrong. The saxons...
Where have they all gone?

33:22.459 --> 33:25.371
First there are too many, now there
aren't enough. Are you ever happy?

33:30.842 --> 33:32.582
Merlin: What was that?
Arthur: What?

33:36.723 --> 33:38.259
Feel the wind.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.805
Gwaine: That wasn't the wind.

34:06.878 --> 34:10.666
- Is that what I think it was?
- Where did morgana get a dragon from?

34:11.299 --> 34:12.708
I have no idea.

34:15.136 --> 34:18.003
Get Gwaine back to percival.
I'll lure the dragon the other way.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.217
Merlin, I've always known
you were stupid...

34:20.433 --> 34:22.799
- But not that stupid.
- No, really, I'm that stupid...

34:22.978 --> 34:25.764
And if you don't believe me, watch.
Merlin!

34:29.734 --> 34:31.224
I'm going after him.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.219
Aithusa.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.705
What happened?

35:32.797 --> 35:34.503
Who did this to you?

35:36.426 --> 35:38.166
I won't harm you.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.470
What does that mean?

35:50.732 --> 35:52.472
You can't speak.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.850
Arthur: Merlin!

35:58.114 --> 35:59.650
(50.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.245
Merlin?

36:17.717 --> 36:19.207
Merlin?

36:26.434 --> 36:29.141
Morgana: How good of you
to save me the trouble of finding you.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.350
Oh dear, how remiss of you.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.098
Your bravery's matched
only by your stupidity.

36:35.819 --> 36:38.652
What on earth did you think
you would achieve by coming here?

36:39.572 --> 36:41.062
I had to free my men.

36:44.077 --> 36:45.362
Unh!

36:49.833 --> 36:51.824
This time it seems
there really is no way out.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.788
I'm sorry about what
our father did to you.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.334
Uther was never my father.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.916
But we are brother and sister.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.220
Funny how you choose to remember that
with my dagger at your back.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.344
What happened to you, morgana?

37:09.728 --> 37:12.686
As a child, you were so kind,
so compassionate.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.183
I grew up.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.436
You're right to cower before my hand.

37:21.865 --> 37:24.231
I am more powerful
than you could ever imagine.

37:24.409 --> 37:27.947
And yet with all that,
you choose to do nothing but hate.

37:28.955 --> 37:30.411
Uther taught me well.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.741
- Goodbye, Arthur pendragon.
Merlin: Arthur!

37:37.589 --> 37:38.589
Merlin: Whoa!

37:44.512 --> 37:45.547
Morgana.

37:52.353 --> 37:53.388
Please.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.139
Don't speak, dear brother.

37:58.902 --> 38:00.392
It's too late.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.540
Mordred?

38:56.876 --> 38:58.241
Arthur.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.453
Emrys.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.452
Be still.

39:43.131 --> 39:46.123
Much blood has been shed this day...

39:47.093 --> 39:49.254
And all for something...

39:50.096 --> 39:53.554
Few wise men would ever want.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.673
You mean the diamair?

39:58.104 --> 40:00.095
Morgana never found it.

40:01.149 --> 40:03.481
And she never will

40:05.987 --> 40:07.318
because it is you.

40:08.781 --> 40:11.238
You are the key to all knowledge.

40:13.536 --> 40:17.745
There are times when I feel the weight
of my destiny crushing me...

40:18.666 --> 40:20.327
But that's nothing to what you carry.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.955
It is both a blessing...

40:23.755 --> 40:25.336
And

40:26.633 --> 40:28.498
a curse.

40:30.053 --> 40:33.762
Is there anything you wish to ask me?

40:35.058 --> 40:36.389
No

40:39.187 --> 40:41.394
I don't think it would be good.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.767
You are wise, emrys.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.607
Your wisdom will live long...

40:49.822 --> 40:51.778
In the minds of men.

40:55.036 --> 40:56.401
Wait

40:58.289 --> 41:00.120
there is one question.

41:04.337 --> 41:07.249
If mordred is not Arthur's bane,
then who is?

41:26.859 --> 41:29.692
Arise, sir mordred...

41:30.488 --> 41:32.444
Knight of Camelot.

41:48.715 --> 41:50.296
Here

41:51.342 --> 41:53.424
let me help you with that.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.717
Thank you.

42:00.643 --> 42:06.058
You know, if Arthur knew you had magic,
things would be very different.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.442
Tell me something.

42:16.325 --> 42:17.815
Of course.

42:17.994 --> 42:20.610
You saved Arthur's life

42:21.539 --> 42:23.245
why?

42:24.876 --> 42:26.787
Because Arthur is right.

42:27.587 --> 42:30.044
The love that binds us
is more important...

42:30.256 --> 42:32.372
Than the power we wield.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.922
Morgana had forgotten that.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.730
It's been a big day. You must be tired.

42:57.867 --> 42:59.323
Too tired for pudding?

42:59.994 --> 43:01.700
Is there pudding?

43:03.664 --> 43:05.325
Is that my favorite?

43:11.255 --> 43:13.462
So are you going to tell me
what's troubling you?

43:14.759 --> 43:16.590
Mordred.

43:19.222 --> 43:20.758
People change.

43:22.975 --> 43:26.183
Perhaps you should give him
the benefit of the doubt.

43:29.398 --> 43:31.480
Remember what the dragon said?

43:32.485 --> 43:34.476
Arthur would meet his end
at the hands of a druid.

43:34.654 --> 43:37.020
You still believe that's him?

43:38.074 --> 43:40.065
I feel that the die is cast.

43:41.119 --> 43:43.075
And that for good or ill...

43:43.913 --> 43:46.620
Albion's great trial has begun.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.025
It has the power...

44:20.283 --> 44:22.649
To summon the spirits
of the dead

44:23.452 --> 44:24.487
ohl

44:32.837 --> 44:34.373
I know it's you, father.
