00:06.618 --> 00:10.486
Y ou know, I used to think the only reason
to kill a man was self-defense...

00:10.556 --> 00:14.287
but I just spent 45 minutes in the Volvo
with another reason.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

00:28.574 --> 00:32.634
- What's wrong with him?
- This idiot is taking a mime class.

00:40.085 --> 00:41.518
Carlton, get...

00:42.120 --> 00:44.816
I swear to God, Carlton,
get away from me with this. Stop.

00:44.890 --> 00:48.121
Stop playing. Carlton, stop or I'll hang you
with that rope!

00:56.501 --> 00:58.731
All right, that's it. That's it.

01:08.513 --> 01:10.140
I was going to throw him out
on the freeway...

01:10.215 --> 01:12.979
but you know the old saying:

01:13.051 --> 01:15.451
A mime is a terrible thing to waste.

02:32.698 --> 02:36.828
Now we are entering the kitchen.
This is where we eat.

02:40.539 --> 02:42.370
Some of us more than others.

02:44.242 --> 02:45.402
And this is your mommy...

02:45.477 --> 02:48.571
and she look like she eating
for a couple of brothers herself.

02:48.814 --> 02:51.248
Will, what are you doing
with that microphone?

02:51.316 --> 02:54.080
Making a tape for the coming attraction.

02:54.152 --> 02:56.382
Y ou know, I was going to knit
some booties or something...

02:56.455 --> 02:58.116
but you know, I had to get yarn...

02:58.190 --> 03:01.819
and needles and...
I'd have had to learn how to knit.

03:02.294 --> 03:04.888
See, look, Uncle Phil, the concept is to...

03:04.963 --> 03:07.591
aesthetically capture for posterity...

03:07.733 --> 03:10.861
the sounds that are familiar to this house.

03:11.203 --> 03:12.568
Will, I'm eating.

03:13.939 --> 03:17.306
- Y ou'll hear a lot of that.
- Y ou're grounded.

03:18.944 --> 03:21.139
Okay, that about sums up Uncle Phil.

03:21.980 --> 03:24.642
Y o, G, what sound
do you think accurately...

03:24.716 --> 03:26.946
depicts your position in the family?

03:31.723 --> 03:33.418
Y ou're sick, man. See a therapist, okay?

03:35.660 --> 03:37.890
Hey, Ashley, say something to the baby.

03:41.833 --> 03:44.233
- Care to elaborate?
- A lot.

03:45.604 --> 03:49.370
Don't feel bad. She just mad
'cause she found out she ain't adopted.

03:49.441 --> 03:51.306
So Mom's having a baby. Big deal.

03:51.376 --> 03:53.344
I bet you didn't go through all this for me.

03:53.478 --> 03:55.002
Y ou probably smoked cigarettes...

03:55.080 --> 03:57.241
and rode horseback
until the day I was born.

03:57.315 --> 04:01.445
Ashley, honey, come on, we prepared
for you and took the same precautions...

04:01.520 --> 04:03.613
as we did for Hilary and Carlton.

04:03.922 --> 04:06.015
Bungee jumping.

04:07.092 --> 04:09.253
Philip, the baby's moving,
feel my stomach.

04:09.327 --> 04:12.785
Hey, I move all the time.
Let's have a party.

04:12.898 --> 04:14.695
All you guys do is talk about the baby.

04:14.766 --> 04:18.327
The baby's clothes, the baby's room.
The baby, baby, baby.

04:18.570 --> 04:21.164
Y ou'll forget all about me
after you have it, Mommy.

04:22.207 --> 04:24.107
I can see it coming.

04:27.579 --> 04:30.309
Good morning, Geoffrey.
Morning, everybody.

04:32.284 --> 04:35.082
Geoffrey, my place isn't set,
and where's my food?

04:37.155 --> 04:39.214
Let me feed my favorite little cousin.

04:39.291 --> 04:41.486
- Oh, now, come on.
- Oh, I thought it was my turn.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.289
I thought I was your favorite cousin.

04:43.361 --> 04:46.228
What do I have to do,
spit up on your shirt?

04:48.733 --> 04:50.030
Y'all hear something?

04:50.101 --> 04:53.002
Y eah, how about me screaming
at the top of my lungs?

04:58.043 --> 05:01.103
I guess not. I be tripping, boy, tripping.

05:03.215 --> 05:06.343
- Daddy.
- There's my favorite little girl.

05:09.654 --> 05:12.817
Daddy, don't you remember me?
It's me, Ashley.

05:14.593 --> 05:16.254
She's so precious.

05:17.095 --> 05:19.086
Y ou know, she reminds me of someone.

05:19.164 --> 05:21.462
That little girl who used to hang out
around here.

05:21.533 --> 05:24.297
- Pretty little thing. Black hair.
- Amanda.

05:24.736 --> 05:25.725
Ashley.

05:25.837 --> 05:28.897
- Or was it Anna?
- No. Ashley.

05:29.140 --> 05:31.199
I'm pretty sure it was Appalonia.

05:31.276 --> 05:33.801
No, it was Ashley.

05:34.279 --> 05:37.578
- Well, hold up, was it Ashley?
- Y es.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.274
- No.
- No.

05:43.889 --> 05:46.119
Ashley, honey,
your father and I have always been here...

05:46.191 --> 05:48.352
and we will always make time for you.

05:48.927 --> 05:50.861
Hilary, why not?
I mean, it will help your ratings.

05:50.929 --> 05:52.829
I don't want to hear about it anymore,
okay?

05:52.898 --> 05:56.334
Now, here come your two
eldest siblings, Dopey and Greedy.

05:56.401 --> 06:00.098
No, Carlton, I will not plug your
stupid school play on my weather spot...

06:00.171 --> 06:02.105
today, tomorrow, or ever.

06:02.173 --> 06:05.870
Well, for your information,
<i>Brigadoon</i> is a classic musical comedy.

06:06.278 --> 06:10.009
No, man, for my money,
classic musical comedy: Milli Vanilli.

06:10.715 --> 06:14.310
Think about it,
Hilary's special because she's the oldest.

06:14.386 --> 06:18.720
Carlton's the only boy.
I was the baby, but who am I now?

06:18.990 --> 06:20.116
The whiner.

06:21.393 --> 06:23.088
Look, lighten up, Ashley.

06:23.161 --> 06:25.026
We all have our burdens to bear...

06:25.096 --> 06:28.327
I mean, when the new Banks arrives,
Dad's going to have to update his will...

06:28.400 --> 06:31.198
which means there'll be another
slice of the pie I won't be getting.

06:31.269 --> 06:33.635
I mean, what about my needs?
What about me?

06:33.705 --> 06:35.969
- What about...
- Shut up, Carlton.

06:36.341 --> 06:37.433
Good call.

06:43.214 --> 06:45.273
I can't wait till the new baby's born.

06:45.350 --> 06:48.478
Then I can do all those special things
that big sisters do.

06:48.753 --> 06:50.516
Like when you took me up
to the attic window...

06:50.588 --> 06:52.215
and told me I could fly?

06:52.490 --> 06:55.482
Or when you told me it was okay
to roller skate down the steps.

06:57.195 --> 06:59.060
Judging by your lovely
brothers and sisters...

06:59.130 --> 07:02.657
you're going to need an insurance policy
before you're potty trained.

07:02.734 --> 07:05.635
Look, I'll have you guys know
that I had a hand in raising you.

07:05.704 --> 07:09.868
I'll be a positive influence
on the new baby. Y ou just wait and see.

07:12.410 --> 07:15.607
Hilary, baby, you're 30 years old.

07:15.714 --> 07:18.274
Don't you think it's about time
you moved out on your own?

07:18.350 --> 07:20.318
That is so unfair.

07:20.385 --> 07:23.786
Mom's 50 years old
and you haven't pushed her out the door.

07:24.923 --> 07:26.550
Why do I even bother?

07:30.195 --> 07:31.184
Cindy.

07:34.499 --> 07:36.797
Aren't you forgetting something,
baby sister?

07:36.868 --> 07:40.702
- Y ou're prettier than I'll ever be.
- Something else.

07:43.108 --> 07:44.302
Good.

07:44.376 --> 07:46.367
Now, I'm feeling a little warm.

07:53.151 --> 07:56.245
So, tell me about your day at school...

07:56.488 --> 07:58.422
and move a little to the left.

07:58.556 --> 08:02.014
Well, Miss Randolph gave a pop quiz
and l...

08:02.093 --> 08:05.392
- Do you like my outfit?
- It's real pretty.

08:06.431 --> 08:09.662
Hilary, my arm is starting to hurt.

08:10.568 --> 08:13.128
Y ou poor baby. Use the other arm.

08:13.838 --> 08:16.204
Maybe you should start lifting weights.

08:16.775 --> 08:18.675
Anyway, go on with your story.

08:19.144 --> 08:23.171
Well, Myra Walker brought a hamster
to class for show and tell...

08:23.248 --> 08:27.048
- Should I color my hair?
- No, it's beautiful.

08:27.886 --> 08:29.251
It is, isn't it?

08:31.990 --> 08:33.389
Guess what?

08:33.792 --> 08:36.226
I have a little surprise for you.

08:39.230 --> 08:40.288
Ta-da!

08:40.365 --> 08:44.164
Oh, goody, a shoeshine kit.

08:45.303 --> 08:48.329
I know I spoil you,
but I just couldn't resist.

08:50.642 --> 08:52.234
Do you like my shoes?

08:53.011 --> 08:54.478
They're great.

08:54.579 --> 08:57.446
Well, you know, they'd be even better...

08:58.049 --> 08:59.710
if they were shiny.

08:59.784 --> 09:01.877
Can I put the fan down first?

09:02.587 --> 09:05.181
This time. It is your birthday.

09:06.057 --> 09:07.991
But don't make a habit of it.

09:15.667 --> 09:17.259
A spit polish.

09:18.903 --> 09:20.734
I meant on the shoes.

09:26.177 --> 09:29.112
Maybe I'd just be better off being invisible.

09:29.681 --> 09:31.410
I'm sorry, what'd you say, Ash?

09:34.486 --> 09:37.353
Hold it there, home fry.
Say a little something to spud.

09:38.423 --> 09:40.357
Hey, little bro, piece of advice:

09:40.425 --> 09:43.622
Don't lend Will a penny
even if he begs, and he will.

09:48.166 --> 09:49.997
That's your brother Carlton.

09:50.068 --> 09:52.764
Y ou'll recognize him,
he'll be the one at eye-level.

09:58.376 --> 09:59.365
Hello.

09:59.511 --> 10:02.173
Hello, Dr. Graham.
Y es, this is Philip Banks.

10:02.514 --> 10:05.005
Fine, fine, thank you, and how are you?

10:08.820 --> 10:10.048
Unusual?

10:12.323 --> 10:14.348
I see.

10:16.294 --> 10:17.522
Are you sure?

10:19.430 --> 10:21.990
Okay, I'll tell her right away.

10:22.901 --> 10:24.801
Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

10:27.739 --> 10:29.832
Vivian, you better sit down.

10:31.242 --> 10:32.834
I am sitting down.

10:33.311 --> 10:35.279
Philip, is there something wrong
with the baby?

10:35.346 --> 10:36.574
No, that was the doctor.

10:36.648 --> 10:39.412
He just said that he thinks
that we're having twins.

10:39.484 --> 10:40.576
Twins!

10:40.652 --> 10:43.883
- Oh, my God!
- Two birds! Two birds!

10:55.133 --> 10:56.464
- Come on, Daddy.
- Come on.

10:56.534 --> 10:57.694
- Philip, honey.
- Come on.

10:57.769 --> 10:59.498
I got it, y'all. Look out.

11:05.877 --> 11:07.208
What happened?

11:07.345 --> 11:08.972
Come on, get him up, get him up.

11:09.047 --> 11:11.777
I remember something about twins...

11:12.450 --> 11:14.941
and I have this incredible urge
for a sausage.

11:15.019 --> 11:17.351
Philip, the doctor called,
but there must be some mistake.

11:17.422 --> 11:19.652
I couldn't possibly be having twins.

11:19.791 --> 11:22.282
We'll have to split the inheritance
four ways...

11:22.360 --> 11:24.328
thanks to Forget-the-pill Phil.

11:25.763 --> 11:27.754
Is that all you think about?

11:29.200 --> 11:30.394
Pretty much.

11:33.404 --> 11:35.998
I don't know about y'all,
I'm excited we having twins.

11:36.074 --> 11:38.565
I mean, now you can finally have the son
you always wanted.

11:38.643 --> 11:40.440
Well, they already have me.

11:40.912 --> 11:43.437
Now, you can finally have the son
you always wanted.

11:48.853 --> 11:50.013
Hello.

11:50.955 --> 11:52.252
Y es, Doctor.

11:52.323 --> 11:54.223
Y ou know, I figured there must be
some mistake.

11:54.292 --> 11:56.817
I knew I couldn't possibly be having twins.

11:57.729 --> 11:59.094
Triplets?

12:01.299 --> 12:03.062
That's right, Mrs. Banks.

12:03.134 --> 12:05.398
Y ou'll be having three little ones...

12:05.470 --> 12:07.836
so I suggest a lot more help.

12:07.905 --> 12:09.896
Preferably a young nanny...

12:09.974 --> 12:13.137
amply endowed, with no inhibitions.

12:17.048 --> 12:20.677
Hello. Might I get you anything?

12:20.752 --> 12:23.585
- An explanation.
- Mid-life crisis.

12:24.989 --> 12:26.786
Geoffrey, why did you do it?

12:26.891 --> 12:28.654
I'm terribly sorry, madam.

12:28.726 --> 12:30.785
It was just the thought
of one more person...

12:30.862 --> 12:33.353
to clean up after
was more than I could bear.

12:33.431 --> 12:36.298
Geoffrey, this baby
is all of our responsibility...

12:36.367 --> 12:39.598
and I promise you
we will not leave you with all the work.

12:49.047 --> 12:52.312
Geoffrey, I told you,
I wanted tomatoes in my omelet.

12:52.450 --> 12:55.476
Geoffrey, I need some sliced cucumbers
for my eyelids.

13:05.363 --> 13:06.990
G, the phone's ringing.

13:07.799 --> 13:11.394
Geoffrey, you did my homework all wrong.
Do it again.

13:13.638 --> 13:15.868
Master William,
would you go change the baby?

13:15.940 --> 13:17.999
I'm trying to do 10 things at once!

13:18.076 --> 13:20.772
Sorry, no can do, G.
I'm about to go shoot some hoops.

13:20.845 --> 13:22.608
Hey, do me a favor,
spit shine my kicks for me, though.

13:22.680 --> 13:23.772
Thanks, babe.

13:28.553 --> 13:31.283
For heaven's sake, I'll get it.

13:36.294 --> 13:39.286
Hello. Hi, Daddy.

13:39.364 --> 13:41.389
Geoffrey is so lazy.

13:44.369 --> 13:46.132
So, how's Jamaica?

13:46.604 --> 13:49.334
What'd you buy me? Great. Great.

13:49.407 --> 13:51.932
Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.110
Well, what did your father say?

13:54.178 --> 13:56.544
For God's sake,
when are they coming back?

13:56.614 --> 13:58.946
They'll be home in time for graduation.

14:00.284 --> 14:02.377
- Thank heavens.
- The baby's.

14:02.453 --> 14:04.853
They figure you can handle things
until then.

14:04.922 --> 14:06.753
Look, G, check it out,
I'm a peace-Ioving brother...

14:06.824 --> 14:09.520
but if you don't hurry up with my kicks,
I'm gonna split your wig, man.

14:09.594 --> 14:11.960
- I want a new omelet.
- Homework.

14:12.029 --> 14:13.621
- Cucumbers.
- Are you ignorant?

14:15.566 --> 14:18.194
- I know you old.
- I want the omelet.

14:19.470 --> 14:21.563
When you old, you do stuff like this.

14:21.639 --> 14:23.231
What's up with my kicks?

14:23.307 --> 14:25.605
Calgon, take me away!

14:28.679 --> 14:30.613
Geoffrey, you're exaggerating.

14:31.182 --> 14:33.673
And you're lying
through your bonded teeth.

14:38.055 --> 14:41.491
Well, that's Geoffrey.
He pretends he doesn't like the family...

14:41.559 --> 14:44.221
but deep down inside he really hates us.

14:44.662 --> 14:46.095
That's not true.

14:46.164 --> 14:47.961
I can tolerate Miss Ashley.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.801
Man, I can't wait to start my own family.

14:51.936 --> 14:56.032
Y o, I want to have
a whole bunch of kids, like six...

14:56.107 --> 14:58.268
and I'm going to have them
one right after another.

14:58.342 --> 15:02.039
Will, we're talking about kids,
not malt liquor.

15:04.449 --> 15:06.076
Why don't you shut up
before we send you back...

15:06.150 --> 15:09.051
to that white family
that dropped you off on the doorstep?

15:11.289 --> 15:13.484
I don't know if I want to have kids.

15:13.558 --> 15:14.582
Why not?

15:14.959 --> 15:16.688
I told you, I don't know.

15:17.762 --> 15:19.627
Hilary, honey,
you're gonna change your mind.

15:19.697 --> 15:21.858
Having kids makes life worthwhile.

15:22.667 --> 15:25.966
Boy, I just can't wait.
I mean, I'm gonna have the perfect life...

15:26.037 --> 15:29.302
with a perfect wife and perfect kids.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.069
It's perfect.

15:35.780 --> 15:37.247
Honey, I'm home.

15:37.982 --> 15:42.146
Hi, dear, did you have a tough day
shooting the naked centerfolds?

15:42.320 --> 15:44.288
Y eah, babe, it was hell.

15:44.422 --> 15:45.821
Today we shot La Toya Jackson.

15:45.890 --> 15:49.155
And I had to keep turning the lights off
'cause she was melting.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.854
Y ou poor baby.

15:57.268 --> 15:59.702
Why don't you glue yourself
to the television set...

15:59.770 --> 16:01.465
completely ignore me...

16:01.606 --> 16:04.939
and play Nintendo
until you're too tired to make love?

16:05.943 --> 16:10.073
- Y ou mean you don't mind?
- Have I ever? I'm perfect.

16:18.256 --> 16:22.955
- Hello, Father.
- Hey, Shaquille, Barkley, Jordan.

16:26.230 --> 16:27.788
Okay, forget about that. Check it out.

16:27.865 --> 16:30.629
Why don't we go outside
and shoot some hoops?

16:30.701 --> 16:32.032
What are hoops?

16:32.537 --> 16:34.334
I think he's referring to that sport...

16:34.405 --> 16:37.238
where a spherical object
is thrown into a round receptacle...

16:37.308 --> 16:39.242
at opposite ends of a court.

16:39.777 --> 16:41.870
Y ou watch your mouth, boy.

16:41.946 --> 16:44.881
All right, look, forget basketball.
Come here, come here, come here.

16:44.982 --> 16:47.542
What do y'all say we sneak
and get some candy before dinner?

16:47.618 --> 16:51.850
But that would spoil our appetite,
and tonight we're having liver.

16:51.956 --> 16:55.357
Y eah!

16:55.426 --> 16:56.620
Shantay!

16:58.095 --> 16:59.392
Don't do that.

16:59.830 --> 17:02.594
I'm sorry, dear. Did you want something?

17:02.767 --> 17:06.134
Y es, I'd like to know
what pods these kids came from.

17:06.737 --> 17:08.967
Actually, Father, we came from a zygote.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.133
Y ou see, in human reproduction...

17:11.208 --> 17:14.734
Knock it off.
<i>E</i> ver since you won that Nobel Prize...

17:14.811 --> 17:16.939
you think you're so doggone smart.

17:17.013 --> 17:18.948
Honey, you seem tense.

17:19.050 --> 17:22.076
I am tense.
<i>E</i> verybody all perfect, baby, I don't know.

17:22.787 --> 17:24.652
Why don't I send the children away...

17:24.722 --> 17:27.213
and dress up
in that French maid's uniform...

17:27.290 --> 17:29.486
and give you a nice hot-oil massage?

17:32.563 --> 17:34.531
Y ou, you, you!

17:34.865 --> 17:36.992
Why must everything
always be about you?

17:37.568 --> 17:39.331
What about my needs?

17:40.271 --> 17:43.263
I'm sorry, honey. What do you want?

17:43.941 --> 17:46.501
I want a girl with extensions in her hair...

17:47.211 --> 17:49.907
and bamboo earrings, at least two pair.

17:51.248 --> 17:53.682
I want kids
that pick their noses sometimes...

17:53.751 --> 17:55.912
and roll me when I'm drunk.

17:56.153 --> 17:58.951
I mean, I want a dirty house.

17:59.924 --> 18:02.051
No, I want a dirty house.

18:05.930 --> 18:07.795
I want to argue in public, you know.

18:07.865 --> 18:11.426
I want you to have a headache sometime.
I want a regular life.

18:11.569 --> 18:13.662
I want a regular marriage.

18:13.738 --> 18:15.569
Sweetheart, you seem upset.

18:16.741 --> 18:19.073
Let's all give Daddy a great big hug.

18:19.143 --> 18:20.542
- No! No!
- Y eah!

18:21.045 --> 18:22.774
No!

18:26.984 --> 18:30.442
See, Will, I told you
this baby thing was a lousy idea.

18:30.621 --> 18:32.646
Kids aren't all they're cracked up to be.

18:32.723 --> 18:35.089
And I know, I used to be one.

18:35.426 --> 18:36.950
Now, stop it all of you.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.552
Now, I cannot wait
for this baby to get here.

18:38.629 --> 18:39.618
And that's not just because...

18:39.697 --> 18:42.962
I'm retaining more water
than the Hoover Dam.

18:43.401 --> 18:44.698
Ashley, honey...

18:44.769 --> 18:46.464
we're not going to forget you
when the baby comes.

18:46.537 --> 18:49.404
Y ou'll see,
this will bring us all closer together.

18:50.141 --> 18:52.439
That's true, Ash. I mean, look at us now.

18:52.677 --> 18:56.044
Last time we sat around like this
is when they reran <i>Roots.</i>

18:56.781 --> 18:58.146
Maybe you guys are right.

18:58.215 --> 19:01.582
We shouldn't be so selfish
and think about ourselves all the time...

19:01.652 --> 19:02.641
Geoffrey.

19:04.255 --> 19:08.214
Well, I guess I don't mind
sharing my inheritance with the baby.

19:08.426 --> 19:11.987
- We're not dead yet, Carlton.
- Hey, it's a cruel world, big guy...

19:12.063 --> 19:14.531
and you're not going to be in it forever.

19:14.632 --> 19:17.567
Come on. Now, now, come on,
let's not spoil the mood.

19:17.635 --> 19:19.330
Come on, let's go to dinner, huh?

19:19.403 --> 19:20.734
- Okay. Y eah.
- Okay. All right.

19:20.805 --> 19:22.295
Y ou, too, Geoffrey.

19:22.373 --> 19:25.968
Zip-a-dee, and might I add doo-dah!

19:27.044 --> 19:28.409
Maybe this will be a good idea.

19:28.479 --> 19:30.504
- I'm going to go grab my sweater.
- Okay.

19:30.915 --> 19:32.576
I don't feel good.

19:32.650 --> 19:34.743
Forget it, Hilary. Y ou're coming.

19:34.952 --> 19:37.614
Okay, but I'm not sitting
between you and the dessert cart.

19:37.688 --> 19:39.383
Last time I almost lost an eye.

19:41.659 --> 19:43.593
Okay, so where are we going?

19:43.661 --> 19:46.425
I say Snuffy's Catfish and Biscuits.

19:47.064 --> 19:49.259
Why don't we
just go eat out of a dumpster?

19:50.601 --> 19:52.262
- Come on, let's decide in the car.
- All right.

19:52.336 --> 19:53.564
How about Haitian?

19:53.637 --> 19:56.265
- Let's get some Haitian food.
- French.

19:57.007 --> 19:58.269
I'm ready.

19:58.342 --> 20:02.142
And, you know, I'm feeling really silly
about that invisible stuff.

20:03.714 --> 20:05.238
Where'd everybody go?

20:07.918 --> 20:10.785
Hey, no! Hey, wait for me! Oh, no!

20:17.828 --> 20:20.353
And all those big nasty women
you be bringing up in here, too.

20:20.431 --> 20:22.058
Y ou think Uncle Phil don't know.
He knows.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.862
He knows what you do, Geoffrey, okay?

20:23.934 --> 20:26.494
Now, I'm asking you to just do my sneaks.

20:26.570 --> 20:28.265
I want to go. I want to run some balls...

20:28.339 --> 20:29.966
going to be some girls there,
I gotta look cute.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.235
If I have dirty sneaks,
other guys going to get the girls.

20:32.309 --> 20:34.140
All I'm asking
is to have some clean sneaks...

20:34.211 --> 20:35.678
when I go dunk on some people, all right?

20:35.746 --> 20:38.681
So, Geoffrey, straighten your act up.
Okay, look, get some...

20:38.749 --> 20:41.582
<i>Ca/gon, take me away!</i>

20:42.305 --> 20:48.347
