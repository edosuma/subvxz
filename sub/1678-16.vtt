<i>OLDER TED; Kids, when it comes to love,</i>

00:17.417 --> 00:20.409
<i>the best relationships are the ones</i>
<i>that just come naturally,</i>

00:20.520 --> 00:22.249
My first solo batch.

00:22.622 --> 00:25.386
I think those need to stay in the oven
awhile longer.

00:25.492 --> 00:26.857
Here's a professional tip.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.020
If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake.

00:30.130 --> 00:31.791
- It's a beverage.
- Yeah, well...

00:31.898 --> 00:35.698
<i>Things with Victoria were fun, And easy,</i>
<i>And uncomplicated,</i>

00:35.802 --> 00:36.826
No, no.

00:36.936 --> 00:38.733
<i>It was pretty great,</i>

00:44.444 --> 00:46.605
Are you coloring in your butt?

00:46.713 --> 00:50.308
I have a big interview coming up.
And my suit has holes in it.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.442
I can't sew. I don't own navy boxers.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.020
So, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.580
- Just wear another one.
- I don't have another one.

00:57.690 --> 01:01.126
I'm flat broke. My only other suit options
are track or birthday.

01:02.529 --> 01:04.622
Dude, you show up to an interview in that,

01:04.730 --> 01:07.723
even the hippie lawyers
from Granola Mountain Earth Pals

01:07.834 --> 01:09.699
will hacky-sack you straight out the door.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.271
Okay, it's
the National Resource Defense Council

01:12.372 --> 01:13.999
and it's my dream job.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.769
Except it's only an internship
and I won't be getting paid.

01:16.876 --> 01:18.366
Mostly getting people coffee.

01:18.478 --> 01:22.471
But the people I'm getting coffee for,
their bosses are gonna save the world.

01:24.184 --> 01:27.483
Okay. Tomorrow... And I should mention
this is gonna rock your world.

01:27.587 --> 01:31.523
Tomorrow, I'm taking you
to my personal tailor.

01:32.058 --> 01:35.221
A tailor?
Barney, I make negative $300 a week

01:35.328 --> 01:37.626
and I need every negative penny of that
for my wedding.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.960
Relax. My guy does everything
for one-third the cost.

01:40.066 --> 01:44.969
And there is no way you're getting married
in that sarcastic-quotation-marks "suit."

01:45.705 --> 01:48.572
Tomorrow. Noon. My tailor.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.635
No thanks, dude.

01:55.648 --> 01:56.615
- Noon?
- Noon.

01:56.716 --> 01:57.944
- Okay.
- See you then.

02:01.121 --> 02:01.287
Hey, girls.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.151
Hey, girls.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.279
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:03.389 --> 02:04.788
Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted.

02:04.891 --> 02:07.052
It's our two-month-iversary,
so we're going out to dinner.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.594
Great. Well, that answers
all the questions I didn't ask.

02:09.696 --> 02:10.788
Robin.

02:10.896 --> 02:12.626
Oh, come on. We bust on each other.

02:12.732 --> 02:14.996
We're just at that place
in our strong friendship.

02:15.101 --> 02:16.295
Really?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.536
Get off me.

02:18.938 --> 02:20.872
Oh, see? I did it again.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.339
(LAUGHING)

02:23.042 --> 02:25.340
What are you guys up to? Dress shopping.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.970
You know, I make wedding cakes
for a lot of fancy bridal shops.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.515
If you want, I could take you shopping.
Maybe get you a discount.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.380
- Really? That would be great.
- VICTORIA: Yeah.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.645
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

02:36.256 --> 02:38.816
I should take this. Bye. Hello?

02:39.225 --> 02:41.489
Hey? I thought it was gonna be
just us tomorrow.

02:41.594 --> 02:43.755
What's with inviting Punky Brewster?

02:43.863 --> 02:47.196
Robin. You've gotta get over
this Ted and Victoria thing.

02:47.300 --> 02:51.532
You had your chance, and now he's moved
on. Can't you just be happy for them?

02:51.838 --> 02:54.102
The best I can give you
is a fake smile and dead eyes.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.674
- Sold.
- Great.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.204
Victoria, what's wrong?

03:01.314 --> 03:05.751
I've just been offered a fellowship
at a culinary institute in Germany.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.219
- Wait. Germany, Europe?
- It's for two years.

03:09.589 --> 03:13.423
I figured I didn't have much of a chance,
'cause they don't let many Americans in,

03:13.526 --> 03:15.016
but I'm in.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.129
So, this is the Europe Germany?

03:18.198 --> 03:21.258
- Ted, what other Germany would it be?
- The one in Epcot?

03:21.367 --> 03:22.766
- Ted.
- Sorry.

03:25.305 --> 03:27.398
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.708
I don't know if I'm gonna go.

03:29.809 --> 03:31.936
And, if you do,
what does that mean for us?

03:32.645 --> 03:33.737
I don't know.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.810
I just... I don't think that
long-distance really works for anyone.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.216
Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie

03:41.321 --> 03:43.915
teenagers tell each other
to get laid the summer before college.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.883
So that leaves us with...

03:48.795 --> 03:51.696
Either you stay here, or we break up.

03:53.666 --> 03:54.724
Wow.

03:56.669 --> 03:59.399
Look, let's just see how things progress
and if, by September, we still...

03:59.505 --> 04:00.767
I have to leave on Monday.

04:00.873 --> 04:02.738
- Monday, September the...
- Ted.

04:06.045 --> 04:08.036
Do you have any thoughts?

04:08.381 --> 04:12.078
Maybe we should each take some time
to think about what we want.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.584
We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.

04:14.721 --> 04:15.847
It's a date.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.386
<i>OLDER TED; And that's when</i>
<i>things got complicated,</i>

04:21.594 --> 04:25.155
- Hey, baby. How's the dress place?
- Well, everything's so fluffy and white.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.928
It's like shopping in a marshmallow.
How's Barney's tailor?

04:30.403 --> 04:34.362
Everything here is dark and sketchy,
and seems illegal.

04:34.574 --> 04:37.042
It's like shopping in Barney's mind.

04:37.143 --> 04:38.906
- Good luck, baby.
- Bye.

04:39.178 --> 04:40.304
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

04:40.480 --> 04:41.708
Hey, Barney?

04:41.814 --> 04:45.545
I'm not sure about this.
A tailor in the backroom of a pet store?

04:45.652 --> 04:48.246
Look, do you want a quality suit
and a free rabbit or not?

04:49.355 --> 04:51.346
(SPEAKING UKRAINIAN)

04:54.360 --> 04:58.160
Ted, Sergei says stop moping around.
You're distracting him from his process.

04:58.264 --> 04:59.356
You speak Ukrainian?

04:59.699 --> 05:01.064
(EX CLAIMS ADMITTEDLY)

05:01.234 --> 05:03.464
Guys. I'm kind of screwed here.

05:03.569 --> 05:07.528
I don't wanna lose Victoria,
but I can't ask her to stay just for me.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.699
And long-distance definitely
isn't an option.

05:09.809 --> 05:13.108
No, no, no. No way.
You know who likes long-distance?

05:13.212 --> 05:16.010
Girls. It's all talking and no sex.
Kill me now.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.981
Hey, don't knock
long-distance relationships.

05:19.085 --> 05:20.746
I really think they can work.

05:20.853 --> 05:22.650
- Really? You?
- BARNEY: Absolutely.

05:22.755 --> 05:25.781
I'm juggling four right now.
There's Lisa in Madrid.

05:25.892 --> 05:29.384
There's Erica in Tokyo.
There's Laura in Denmark.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.985
And Kelly on 34th Street.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.459
(SPEAKING WITH IRISH ACCENT)
The lass thinks

05:33.566 --> 05:35.431
I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.136
Ted, do you remember in college,

05:38.237 --> 05:40.432
when Lily did that summer art program
in Paris?

05:40.540 --> 05:41.507
Yeah.

05:41.607 --> 05:44.337
Well, she kept talking
about this cheesy French guy, Gabrielle.

05:44.777 --> 05:46.745
So, I went out to visit
and there was this party.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.711
And who shows up but Gabrielle.

05:48.815 --> 05:52.182
And he's got this weak-ass,
thin, French moustache.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.846
Yeah, I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew
I could take this weird little dude.

05:55.955 --> 05:58.890
So, I took him aside,
and I got all creepy quiet

05:58.991 --> 06:01.619
and got the crazy eyes going. And I said,

06:02.995 --> 06:06.624
"You stay away from Lily.
Or, I swear to God,

06:06.733 --> 06:11.136
"I'll eat that moustache
right off of your ugly French face."

06:11.237 --> 06:14.172
Yeah. No, he literally ran away.
I think he was crying.

06:15.041 --> 06:19.171
I never told Lily about it.
To be honest, I'm not very proud of it.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.613
To be even more honest, I am.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.877
Other than confirming a lot of European
stereotypes about Americans,

06:26.986 --> 06:29.216
- did that little story have a point?
- Yeah.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.688
The point is,
that even though Lily is my soul mate,

06:31.791 --> 06:33.918
long-distance still almost killed us.

06:34.026 --> 06:37.553
If you think that there's any chance
that Victoria's your soul mate,

06:37.663 --> 06:38.789
you should ask her to stay.

06:38.898 --> 06:42.026
Well, I don't know if she is.
It's still too early. But, yeah, she could be.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.899
Oh, please. You barely know this girl.
What's her favorite color?

06:45.004 --> 06:48.599
Is she a cat person, or a dog person?
Is she open to a three-way?

06:48.708 --> 06:51.541
Ted, I do more research than this
before buying a cell phone.

06:51.644 --> 06:54.340
And, FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.

06:55.515 --> 06:58.109
Look, she can't be a cat person.
I'm a dog person.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.014
I'm attracted to other dog people.

07:00.119 --> 07:02.212
- Are you sure?
- All right.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.287
- Hello?
- Hey, random question.

07:07.393 --> 07:11.693
- How do you feel about cats?
- Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.864
Good to know. Okay, goodbye.

07:16.669 --> 07:20.264
She's a cat person.
I don't know this girl at all.

07:22.141 --> 07:24.200
- Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.
- This one.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.574
Hey, hey. It's my suit.
Shouldn't I be the one to choose?

07:26.946 --> 07:28.140
(LAUGHS)

07:28.314 --> 07:29.975
Here, play with this pincushion.

07:37.156 --> 07:40.148
God, I'm gonna look hot.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.328
Marshall, I can't let you waste
a suit this nice

07:43.429 --> 07:45.795
fighting a losing battle
for our planet's survival.

07:45.898 --> 07:49.527
This is a suit for winners.
I am getting you an interview at my office.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.466
We need good men like you
in our legal department.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.869
We get sued. A lot.

07:54.674 --> 07:57.108
No way. The kid does not sell out.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.838
Oh, come on, dude.
Three months working with me,

07:59.946 --> 08:02.779
you'll make more
than Lily makes in a year.

08:03.182 --> 08:05.173
No. I've made my decision.

08:05.818 --> 08:09.083
So have I. If I ask this girl
to give up her dreams for me,

08:09.188 --> 08:12.919
and, two weeks later, it's not working out,
I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time.

08:13.025 --> 08:15.186
It's just too much pressure
on a new relationship.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.358
I'm gonna tell her to go.

08:20.266 --> 08:23.463
<i>OLDER TED; And so, I met her that night</i>
<i>to tell her my decision,</i>

08:23.569 --> 08:25.867
All right, I've been thinking
a lot about this, and...

08:25.972 --> 08:28.497
Okay, wait. Before you say anything,

08:28.774 --> 08:31.470
I wanted to give you this.

08:32.745 --> 08:36.703
This is what happens when you,
you know, let them finish baking.

08:44.155 --> 08:45.418
I want you to stay.

08:50.429 --> 08:54.388
Everything here is dark and sketchy,
and seems illegal.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.695
It's like shopping in Barney's mind.

08:56.802 --> 08:58.633
- Good luck, baby.
- Bye.

08:59.405 --> 09:02.374
Now, what sort of dress
did you have in mind, dear?

09:02.475 --> 09:06.309
Nothing too huge or poofy.
I'm not really a girly girl.

09:06.412 --> 09:08.937
But I would like to look
like a beautiful princess.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.108
- I saw a couple up front that were nice.
- By the window?

09:12.752 --> 09:16.711
No offense, dear, but those are
a little out of your price range.

09:18.257 --> 09:19.622
Where does she get off?

09:19.725 --> 09:21.352
She doesn't know
how much money I make.

09:21.460 --> 09:22.825
These women are experts.

09:22.929 --> 09:25.659
They can guess your net annual income
just by looking at your underwear.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.093
Damn you, Old Navy
and your reasonably-priced three-packs.

09:30.803 --> 09:33.772
- Well, at least we get free champagne.
- And cake.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.397
Speaking of which, Victoria,

09:35.508 --> 09:39.035
have you decided what to do
about your donut fellowship?

09:39.145 --> 09:43.172
You know, I don't know. I mean,
I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted.

09:43.282 --> 09:46.080
I even thought about long-distance,
as if that ever works.

09:46.185 --> 09:48.551
All talking and no sex. Kill me now.

09:49.722 --> 09:53.488
I know it sounds lame, but I actually think
that Ted might be the one.

09:54.694 --> 09:57.663
- That's pretty hard to walk away from.
- Well, I don't know.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.664
I'd feel a little Stepford
turning down a huge opportunity

10:00.766 --> 10:02.927
to chase some guy
I'd only known two months.

10:03.035 --> 10:07.870
But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted.
He's amazing.

10:07.974 --> 10:12.434
- He's the best guy I know.
- Yeah, in America. But German guys?

10:12.878 --> 10:16.575
I would let them bread my schnitzel
any day, if you know what I mean.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.347
- I really don't.
- Sex.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.013
Excuse me, ma'am.
This bastard's kicked. Thanks.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.689
(BOTH EX CLAIMING)

10:28.461 --> 10:29.928
That's okay, guys, I hate it.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.156
- Just horrible.
- It's bad. It's really bad.

10:32.264 --> 10:36.030
Short in the front, long in the back.
That is the mullet of wedding dresses.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.601
You know, Victoria,
Marshall and I did long-distance once.

10:41.340 --> 10:45.834
In college, I did an art course in Paris.
I was the only American there.

10:46.545 --> 10:50.675
I was really Ionely.
I only had one friend. Gabrielle.

10:50.783 --> 10:53.251
And she was kind of homely
and strange-Iooking.

10:53.352 --> 10:57.186
And she was really self-conscious
about this little moustache she had.

10:57.289 --> 11:00.588
Anyway, halfway through the semester,
she just stopped talking to me,

11:00.693 --> 11:02.058
and I never figured out why.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.062
And then I had nobody.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.360
The only thing that got me through was

11:07.466 --> 11:10.094
knowing that my soul mate
was back at home waiting for me.

11:11.203 --> 11:15.435
If Ted's your soul mate,
then it may be worth it to hang on to him.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.772
But how am I supposed to know
if we're soul mates? It's too soon.

11:18.911 --> 11:20.105
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

11:20.546 --> 11:21.535
Speak of the devil.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.342
- Hello?
- Hey, random question.

11:23.449 --> 11:27.112
- How do you feel about cats?
- Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.

11:27.219 --> 11:30.677
- A cat person. Why am I not surprised?
- Stop it.

11:31.857 --> 11:35.156
Bye. Why does Ted want to know
if I like cats?

11:35.261 --> 11:36.728
Maybe he's gonna buy you one.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.794
I did hear barking in the background.

11:39.899 --> 11:43.426
Maybe he was in a pet store.
Does he want us to get a cat together?

11:43.536 --> 11:47.165
Maybe he's using an adorable kitty
to guilt you into staying.

11:47.940 --> 11:51.307
That is low.
Do you really think that's what he's doing?

11:51.410 --> 11:54.846
Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out.
I would be on the next plane to Germany.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.075
(BOTH EX CLAIMING)

11:59.251 --> 12:01.219
Oh, God. You guys are sucky liars.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.551
- I don't know what to say.
- Ugly, ugly, ugly.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.515
You know what?
We're doing this all wrong.

12:07.626 --> 12:11.790
I'm gonna get you one of those
front-window dresses. Just for fun.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.861
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

12:17.436 --> 12:21.839
Okay. Just kind of seems like you're trying
to hustle Victoria out of the country.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.136
I'm not. I'm just trying to support her.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.178
She got a super-important
dessert scholarship.

12:27.279 --> 12:28.644
Stop being sarcastic.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.512
It is a super-important
dessert scholarship.

12:31.617 --> 12:34.085
Wow, that's hard to say
without sounding sarcastic.

12:35.187 --> 12:38.816
Look, I know you're not
Victoria's biggest fan,

12:39.258 --> 12:41.590
but she seems to make Ted happy.

12:41.927 --> 12:45.363
So think about that before you use
your miles to buy her a plane ticket.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.496
Somebody say beautiful princess?

12:48.601 --> 12:51.161
Oh, my gosh. It's perfect.

12:51.270 --> 12:55.206
Oh, this dress is totally gonna get me laid
on my wedding night.

12:56.976 --> 12:59.035
- Look how happy she is.
- Yeah.

13:00.045 --> 13:03.537
You know, I've always thought of myself
as one of those independent women

13:03.649 --> 13:06.243
who would never let any guy
mess with my career,

13:06.352 --> 13:08.752
and now I'm actually thinking about it.

13:08.854 --> 13:12.585
I feel guilty.
Like it's un-feminist or something.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.018
- I know what you mean.
- You do?

13:18.631 --> 13:22.863
Well, I'm always putting my career
ahead of my relationships

13:22.968 --> 13:27.462
and, to be honest, there's a lot
of Ionely nights in that job description.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.499
See, that's what I'm afraid of.

13:30.209 --> 13:34.543
Well, then, choosing Ted over your career
doesn't make you un-feminist.

13:36.115 --> 13:39.710
Maybe it just means
that you guys would be happy together.

13:40.786 --> 13:45.689
Robin, I think that you are the coolest.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.827
I'm so glad that we're friends.

13:48.928 --> 13:52.295
- Oh, no way, you are the coolest.
- No. No, you are.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.029
Okay, I am.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.128
I'm gonna stay.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.840
(BOTH EX CLAIMING)

14:08.981 --> 14:12.348
I am so beautiful.
Don't tell me how much it costs.

14:12.451 --> 14:15.511
Just snap my neck now
so I can die this pretty.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.881
Wow. You look incredible.

14:18.791 --> 14:22.591
Okay, okay. How much is it?
On a scale of never to never ever.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.555
Never ever, ever, ever, ever times infinity.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.093
Well, it's okay.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.233
You know, what makes a bride beautiful

14:34.340 --> 14:37.400
is that she's just happy
to be getting married.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.371
Oh, guys, I know, I look amazing,

14:43.482 --> 14:47.680
but the important thing is
that Marshall and I love each other, right?

14:47.786 --> 14:49.413
Yes, you're right.

14:49.955 --> 14:53.254
But, also, you just sat down in the cake.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.959
(GASPING)

14:56.629 --> 15:01.532
But you know what? It's gonna come out,
because it's only chocolate and raspberry.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.694
Okay, come on. Get up.
Let us see how bad it is.

15:04.803 --> 15:06.168
(DRESS RIPPING)

15:09.041 --> 15:10.008
(EX CLAIMS)

15:13.145 --> 15:17.548
- It was like this when I found it.
- And how will you be paying for this?

15:20.185 --> 15:22.153
Credit cards.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.790
I wanted to give you this.

15:30.930 --> 15:35.060
This is what happens when you,
you know, let them finish baking.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.103
I want you to stay.

15:47.646 --> 15:49.079
I have to go to Germany.

15:54.420 --> 15:57.514
- You're going?
- Yes. I have to.

15:58.057 --> 16:00.252
- So that's what you decided?
- Well, no.

16:00.359 --> 16:02.850
I mean, I actually came here tonight
leaning towards staying,

16:02.962 --> 16:05.760
but when you just told me to stay,
it made me realize that I have to go.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.491
- What is this, opposite day or something?
- No.

16:08.600 --> 16:09.931
So it is?

16:11.437 --> 16:13.928
Ted, we've only been dating
for two months.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.405
I can't let you make this decision for me.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.443
I was totally gonna tell you to go,
but then you gave me this cupcake,

16:19.545 --> 16:21.274
and it reminded me how great you are.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.940
Well, is there any chance that
you would move to Germany with me?

16:24.149 --> 16:25.912
Well, that's just crazy.

16:26.885 --> 16:27.909
Okay.

16:28.020 --> 16:31.217
So it's fine for me to make sacrifices
for you, but for you, it's crazy.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.553
But you have a job here and a life.
I'd have nothing there.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.059
- You'd have me.
- We've only been dating two months.

16:38.597 --> 16:41.122
It's not fair.
It's not fair that we have to break up.

16:41.233 --> 16:42.632
I hate this.

16:45.537 --> 16:48.165
So we're breaking up?

16:50.542 --> 16:51.873
I guess so.

16:55.481 --> 16:56.812
I guess so.

16:59.151 --> 17:00.886
God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.319
God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.

17:03.555 --> 17:07.992
It was just too much pressure too soon.
I mean, maybe it was silly to even think...

17:08.627 --> 17:11.528
Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit
and it's awesome.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.690
Well, thank you for acknowledging it.
It's weird that you hadn't.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.701
Look, I understand that you guys
had to break up eventually,

17:17.803 --> 17:19.737
- but why today?
- She's leaving tomorrow.

17:19.838 --> 17:21.499
Yeah, but she's still in town.

17:21.607 --> 17:24.040
- Yeah, she's still in town.
- Yeah.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.338
So you spend
one more amazing day together.

17:27.246 --> 17:28.736
Ted, think about it this way,

17:28.847 --> 17:31.247
if you knew that you were gonna
lose your leg tomorrow,

17:31.350 --> 17:33.443
would you sit on the couch
and cry about it,

17:33.552 --> 17:35.747
or would you run and jump

17:35.854 --> 17:38.652
and do some awesome air kicks
while you still could?

17:41.960 --> 17:43.825
Awesome air kicks, huh?

17:45.931 --> 17:47.796
- New pajama bottoms?
- You know it.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.001
So, we can sit around and cry,

17:51.103 --> 17:55.369
or we can run and do awesome air kicks
before our leg gets chopped off.

17:55.474 --> 17:59.308
- Wait, so we're sharing the leg?
- No, the leg is a metaphor.

17:59.878 --> 18:03.075
How could the leg be well enough
to do awesome air kicks one day

18:03.182 --> 18:06.709
and yet still so sick
it needs to be chopped off the next?

18:08.220 --> 18:10.120
- I don't know, Ted.
- Come on.

18:10.222 --> 18:12.986
We've had a good run. Why end on a fight?

18:13.292 --> 18:14.725
Well, what would you want to do?

18:14.827 --> 18:16.226
Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing

18:16.328 --> 18:18.125
- and never got around to.
- Like go to the Met?

18:18.230 --> 18:19.788
Yeah, we'll walk across
the Brooklyn Bridge.

18:19.898 --> 18:21.593
See some monkeys at the zoo.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.168
Go to that French-Vietnamese place
we keep passing and say we want to try.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.999
- Wow. We better get going.
- Yeah.

18:27.806 --> 18:29.171
- Big day.
- Yeah.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.801
<i>OLDER TED; And kids, that's exactly</i>
<i>what we did with our last day,</i>

18:32.911 --> 18:36.347
<i>The museum, The bridge, The restaurant,</i>

18:36.782 --> 18:38.977
<i>And all of those nice things,</i>

18:39.685 --> 18:42.586
Lily, you have to tell him.
That dress cost a fortune.

18:42.688 --> 18:45.885
No. I am just gonna wait for
the next time Marshall really screws up

18:45.991 --> 18:49.427
and then I'll just slip this in,
and it won't seem so bad by comparison.

18:49.528 --> 18:53.897
- Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.
- Yeah, but only like second base.

18:56.135 --> 19:00.003
Look at us. Two guys in suits.
You feel that slight tingle?

19:00.405 --> 19:04.466
That's every girl in the bar wanting you,
and every guy wanting to be you.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.636
Actually, it's mostly me,
but you're getting some of the splash.

19:09.781 --> 19:10.873
(GRUNTS)

19:11.083 --> 19:15.349
Hey, babe. Dollar beer night.
So I splurged and got us each our own.

19:16.088 --> 19:19.148
So, have you thought any more
about coming to work for Barney Corp?

19:19.258 --> 19:21.852
Oh, please.
Your company is not called Barney Corp.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.052
Yet.

19:23.929 --> 19:26.727
I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.

19:30.302 --> 19:32.167
Barney, this says $4,000.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.739
I thought you said
that it was one-third price!

19:34.840 --> 19:36.501
Must be a $12,000 dollar suit.

19:36.608 --> 19:38.132
Oh, well, guess you'll have
to come work at my company.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.614
You set this up.
You set this whole thing up.

19:42.714 --> 19:45.205
I most certainly did!

19:46.919 --> 19:48.614
Well, it won't work.

19:48.720 --> 19:52.019
Even if I have to get two extra night jobs,
I'll pay your precious tailor.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.058
I'm not selling my soul.

19:55.060 --> 19:57.051
Baby, I know that
this will make things harder,

19:57.162 --> 19:59.187
but I will make it work. I promise.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.789
I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.170
- What time is the interview?
- 9:00 a.m.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.762
And you'll need new shoes. Don't worry.
I know a guy.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.510
Well, I'm glad we got to spend the day
doing awesome air kicks.

20:16.615 --> 20:19.516
Yeah. I was almost too tired
for all the sex.

20:23.488 --> 20:26.889
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I'm gonna miss you, too.

20:34.032 --> 20:38.526
Hey, you know. I mean, if when I get back,
we're still single we can...

20:38.637 --> 20:39.865
Even if we're not.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.708
Okay.

21:00.792 --> 21:04.853
Look, I know it never works for anyone,
but do you wanna try long-distance?

21:04.963 --> 21:06.692
Yes. Yes.

21:10.535 --> 21:12.867
- We can beat the odds.
- Odds, schmodds.

21:12.971 --> 21:16.304
It's gonna work.
We're gonna make it work. It'll work.

21:18.143 --> 21:19.576
<i>OLDER TED; It didn't work,</i>

21:19.678 --> 21:22.306
<i>Long-distance was and is a terrible idea,</i>

21:23.248 --> 21:26.649
<i>A really terrible idea, Just awful,</i>

21:27.519 --> 21:29.419
