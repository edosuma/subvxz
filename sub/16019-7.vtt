00:27.110 --> 00:29.070
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT

00:27.110 --> 00:29.070
ALL WEEK.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.699
I MEAN, I GOTTA GET MY MORNING

00:31.740 --> 00:33.116

00:31.740 --> 00:33.116
ON MONDAY.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.743
YOU'VE GOTTA JUICE

00:33.158 --> 00:34.743

00:34.785 --> 00:36.578

WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS!

00:34.785 --> 00:36.578

00:36.620 --> 00:38.580
YOU LOSE VITAL NUTRIENTS!

00:38.622 --> 00:40.081
MAYBE YOU SUGGEST SOMETHING

00:40.123 --> 00:41.876
INSTEAD OF SHOOTING DOWN

00:40.123 --> 00:41.876
EVERYTHING I SAY.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.085
WELL, THIS JOB MEANS

00:41.917 --> 00:44.085
EVERYTHING TO ME.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.087
IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR

00:44.127 --> 00:46.087
SINCE I'VE BEEN ON WALL STREET,

00:46.129 --> 00:47.297
AND I WANNA GO

00:46.129 --> 00:47.297
INTO HARKIN FINANCIAL

00:47.339 --> 00:48.966
AT THE TOP OF MY GAME.

00:49.008 --> 00:51.343
WELL... DON'T THINK YOU CAN

00:49.008 --> 00:51.343
TALK TO ME LIKE THAT

00:51.385 --> 00:53.929
JUST BECAUSE

00:51.385 --> 00:53.929
I'M THE PERVERT IN THE WINDOW.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.055
I'M SORRY.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.743
REALLY BEEN SLACKING?

01:17.036 --> 01:19.204
THE GIRL THAT WE PAY TO CLEAN--

01:17.036 --> 01:19.204
YOLANDA.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.373

01:19.246 --> 01:21.373
I-I-I CLEAN THE APARTMENT.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.334
I'VE JUST BEEN SO BUSY

01:21.415 --> 01:24.334
GETTING READY FOR MY NEW JOB.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.419
HUH. I COULD'VE SWORN

01:25.460 --> 01:27.337
I WAS AT YOLANDA'S DAUGHTER'S

01:25.460 --> 01:27.337
QUINCEAÑERA.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.506
I WAS  SOMEWHERE

01:27.379 --> 01:29.506
WITH A DORA PIÑATA.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.341
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVEN'T

01:29.548 --> 01:31.341
STARTED THAT JOB YET.

01:31.383 --> 01:33.635
YOU'VE BEEN YIPPING ABOUT IT

01:31.383 --> 01:33.635
FOR WEEKS.

01:33.677 --> 01:36.179
I AM SO NERVOUS. IT'S LIKE

01:33.677 --> 01:36.179
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.765
YOU GOTTA MAKE

01:36.221 --> 01:37.765
A GOOD IMPRESSION.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.059
I MEAN, WHAT IF I CAN'T FIND

01:37.806 --> 01:40.059
ANYONE TO EAT LUNCH WITH?

01:40.099 --> 01:41.142
I TOTALLY KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.144
AT YOLANDA'S DAUGHTER'S

01:41.184 --> 01:43.144
QUINCEAÑERA,

01:43.186 --> 01:45.230
I WAS REALLY WORRIED THAT

01:43.186 --> 01:45.230
I WOULDN'T FIT IN, EITHER.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.232
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:45.272 --> 01:47.232
I DIDN'T. I REALLY DIDN'T.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.445
(hissing)

01:51.486 --> 01:52.780
(door bells jingle)

01:52.821 --> 01:55.365
JUNE. (singsongy) FIRST DAY

01:52.821 --> 01:55.365
AT HARKIN FINANCIAL.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.367
HOW YOU FEELIN'?

01:55.407 --> 01:57.367
EXCITED-NERVOUS-RUSHED.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.160
IS--IS MY ORDER READY?

01:57.409 --> 01:59.160
I CALLED AHEAD.

01:59.202 --> 02:03.040
TALL SKINNY LATTE FOR "JUBE"?!

02:03.082 --> 02:04.458
IT'S ON US.

02:03.082 --> 02:04.458
(sets down cup)

02:04.499 --> 02:07.086
YOU WORKED HERE FOR TEN MONTHS.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.086
IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.880
THANK YOU, MARK.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.880
WE'LL CATCH UP SOON, I PROMISE.

02:09.922 --> 02:12.257
MARK, WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE HER

02:09.922 --> 02:12.257
OUR GOING AWAY CARD?!

02:12.299 --> 02:14.175
STAY OUT OF IT, PEPPER!

02:12.299 --> 02:14.175
(scoffs)

02:14.217 --> 02:15.970
HEY, MARK, GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.805
REGRETTING

02:16.011 --> 02:17.805
GIVING YOU MY NUMBER.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.056
WHAT'S THE CRISIS?

02:19.098 --> 02:20.348
I NEED ADVICE.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.184
PEPPER AND I GOT JUNE A CARD,

02:20.390 --> 02:23.184
BUT WHEN I WENT TO SIGN IT,

02:23.226 --> 02:24.352
I GOT ALL IN MY HEAD.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.854
I MEAN,

02:24.394 --> 02:25.854
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE LIKE

02:25.896 --> 02:29.190
NOW THAT SHE'S GOT A NEW JOB,

02:25.896 --> 02:29.190
AND I'M SINGLE?

02:29.232 --> 02:31.568
I WANTED TO WRITE SOMETHING

02:29.232 --> 02:31.568
SWEET, BUT NOT TOO SWEET.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.612
THEN I PANICKED

02:31.610 --> 02:33.612
AND WROTE THIS.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.617
"DEAR JUNE, I DON'T CARE

02:35.238 --> 02:38.617
WHAT YOU DO. MARK."

02:38.659 --> 02:41.662
I CAN'T GIVE HER THAT.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.662
AND I CAN'T GET A NEW CARD.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.999
EVERYONE ELSE HAS ALREADY

02:41.703 --> 02:44.999
SIGNED THIS ONE.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.458
I KNOW YOU GOT SOME

02:45.040 --> 02:46.458
COMPLEX FEELINGS FOR JUNE,

02:46.500 --> 02:47.835
BUT I'M GONNA HELP YOU

02:46.500 --> 02:47.835
FIGURE OUT

02:47.876 --> 02:49.294
THE PERFECT THING TO SAY

02:47.876 --> 02:49.294
IN THAT CARD.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.212
LUCKY FOR YOU, AS AN ACTOR,

02:51.254 --> 02:53.090
I KNOW EVERYTHING

02:51.254 --> 02:53.090
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT WRITING.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.257
GREAT. THANKS.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.217
ALSO KNOW EVERYTHING

02:54.299 --> 02:56.217
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT MEDICINE,

02:56.259 --> 02:58.762
BEING A FIREMAN

02:56.259 --> 02:58.762
AND AN ASTRONAUT.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.433
YOU CAN GET YOUR BADGE

03:01.348 --> 03:03.433
AT SECURITY STAFF MEETINGS

03:03.475 --> 03:04.601
EVERY DAY AT 9:00 A.M.,

03:04.643 --> 03:06.227
BUT SOMETIMES YOU WILL NEED

03:04.643 --> 03:06.227
TO BE HERE EARLY

03:06.269 --> 03:07.729
FOR THE ASIAN MARKETS.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.607
OH, MR. HARKIN, IF NECESSARY,

03:07.771 --> 03:10.607
I WILL SLEEP HERE.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.026
(laughs) I LOVE IT.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.485
BUT DISCUSSING WHERE YOU SLEEP

03:12.067 --> 03:13.485
IS A VIOLATION

03:13.527 --> 03:16.237
OF THE WORKPLACE

03:13.527 --> 03:16.237
SEXUAL CONDUCT CODE...

03:16.279 --> 03:18.032
(chuckles) AND I WON'T GO DOWN

03:16.279 --> 03:18.032
THAT ROAD AGAIN.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.282
SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE,

03:18.073 --> 03:19.282
JUNE.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.409
I SEE BIG THINGS FOR YOU

03:19.324 --> 03:21.409
ON THE HORIZON.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.243
THANK YOU, SIR.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.412
(clatters)

03:24.454 --> 03:26.748
(telephone ringing in distance)

03:26.790 --> 03:28.500
(exhales deeply)

03:28.542 --> 03:29.668
'TEW!

03:29.710 --> 03:30.878
'TEW!

03:30.919 --> 03:33.254
OH, MY GOD.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.254
WAS THAT A SNEEZE?

03:33.296 --> 03:35.340
THAT WAS SUPER ADORABLE!

03:35.382 --> 03:37.258
I SNEEZE LIKE A BEAST.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.261
I'M FOX. FOX PARIS.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.930
HI. I'M JUNE COLBURN.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.265
JUST SO YOU KNOW, THE STAFF

03:41.972 --> 03:44.265
MEETINGS START AT 9:00,

03:44.307 --> 03:46.768
BUT THEY EXPECT YOU THERE

03:44.307 --> 03:46.768
BY 8:50, HAVING HAD.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.645
HAVING HAD?

03:46.810 --> 03:48.645
BREAKFAST.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.981
OH.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.981
THIS GUY WALTER

03:48.687 --> 03:50.981
WHO USED TO WORK HERE

03:51.023 --> 03:52.482
BROUGHT A BAGEL IN ONCE.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.693
HARKIN WAS PISSED.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.278
HAVING HAD,  WALTER!

03:57.320 --> 03:59.531
EVERYONE ELSE HERE  HAS  HAD!

03:57.320 --> 03:59.531
DEAR GOD!

03:59.573 --> 04:01.282
WOW. THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.282
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.450
(chuckles)

04:01.324 --> 04:02.450
OH, NO PROBLEM.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.785
I'M SO HAPPY TO HAVE

04:03.827 --> 04:05.286
ANOTHER WOMAN JUNIOR ANALYST

04:03.827 --> 04:05.286
WORKING HERE.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.664
(chuckles)

04:07.706 --> 04:09.290
ARE THOSE SEA MONKEYS?

04:09.332 --> 04:11.710
LOW-MAINTENANCE PETS. (chuckles)

04:09.332 --> 04:11.710
THEY'RE ALL NAMED SIMON.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.212
HELLO, SIMONS.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.212
(laughs)

04:13.253 --> 04:15.130
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

04:13.253 --> 04:15.130
FOR LUNCH LATER?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.673
(chuckles)

04:15.172 --> 04:16.673
HMM?

04:16.715 --> 04:19.300
AND SHE SHOWED ME WHERE TO HIDE

04:16.715 --> 04:19.300
LEFTOVERS IN THE WORK FRIDGE--

04:19.342 --> 04:20.343
BEHIND THE BATTERIES. GENIUS!

04:20.385 --> 04:22.345
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.306
AND SHE SAVED ME

04:22.387 --> 04:25.306
FROM SITTING IN HARKIN'S SEAT.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.017
UM, I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA SIT

04:25.348 --> 04:27.017
AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE,

04:27.059 --> 04:29.519
BUT HE LIKES TO SIT

04:27.059 --> 04:29.519
IN THE MIDDLE AMONG THE PEOPLE.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.813
OH, SHE'S THE BEST.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.813
WE'RE GOING FOR DRINKS TOMORROW.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.024
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.316
SHE'S YOUR NEMESIS.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.318
WHAT?

04:35.358 --> 04:37.318
THAT GIRL HAS IT OUT FOR YOU.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.113
DID SHE ASK YOU QUESTIONS

04:37.360 --> 04:39.113
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?

04:39.154 --> 04:40.321
DID SHE COMPLIMENT

04:39.154 --> 04:40.321
YOUR JEWELRY?

04:40.363 --> 04:41.698
YEAH, M-MY POWER BROOCH.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.491
SHE'S STUDYING YOU

04:41.740 --> 04:43.491
TO FIND YOUR WEAKNESS.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.827
SHE'S FIGURING OUT THE MOST

04:43.533 --> 04:45.827
EFFICIENT WAY TO TAKE YOU DOWN.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.371
DOES SHE HAVE A BACK TATTOO?

04:45.869 --> 04:48.371
DOES SHE WEAR A WIG?

04:48.413 --> 04:51.125
LOOK, UM...

04:51.166 --> 04:52.375
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

04:51.166 --> 04:52.375
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.836
I'M SURE IF THIS WERE, LIKE,

04:52.417 --> 04:54.836
COCKFIGHTING

04:54.878 --> 04:56.379
OR D-DRUG LORDING

04:56.421 --> 04:59.340
OR WHAT--WHATEVER IT IS

04:56.421 --> 04:59.340
THAT YOU DO, YOU'D BE RIGHT.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.592
BUT I'M A PROFESSIONAL,

05:00.634 --> 05:04.387
AND I DON'T WALK INTO AN OFFICE

05:00.634 --> 05:04.387
AND IMMEDIATELY GET A NEMESIS.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.347
THINK WHAT YOU WANT,

05:04.429 --> 05:06.347
BUT I KNOW THIS GIRL.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.349
I AM THIS GIRL.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.349
AND SHE'S YOUR NEMESIS.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.351
BECAUSE IF I WORKED THERE,

05:08.391 --> 05:10.351
I'D BE YOUR NEMESIS, TOO.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.271
BY THE WAY,

05:10.393 --> 05:12.271
I LOVE YOUR BROOCH.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.230
WHY, THANK YOU.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.856
JUNE! COME ON!

05:14.898 --> 05:17.358
♪ LA-LA, LA-LA, LA-LA, LA-LA ♪

05:17.400 --> 05:19.360
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?

05:19.402 --> 05:21.362
"I'M GONNA MISS YOU

05:19.402 --> 05:21.362
A LATTE"?

05:21.404 --> 05:23.240
NO PUNS. UNWARRANTED PUN.

05:23.282 --> 05:25.200
OKAY, HOW'S THIS?

05:25.242 --> 05:27.535
"JUNE, I HATE THE THOUGHT

05:25.242 --> 05:27.535
OF NOT SEEING YOU EVERY DAY.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.371
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE THINGS

05:27.577 --> 05:30.371
TO THE NEXT LEVEL"?

05:30.413 --> 05:33.250
THEN I GIVE HER THE CARD

05:30.413 --> 05:33.250
AND I LAY ONE ON HER.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.542
WHAT--W-W-W--

05:34.584 --> 05:36.377
WHY WOULD YOU FART ON HER

05:34.584 --> 05:36.377
IN HER SLEEP?

05:36.419 --> 05:37.587
WHAT?

05:37.629 --> 05:38.880
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA

05:37.629 --> 05:38.880
LAY ONE ON HER.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.381
THAT'S WHEN YOU TOOT ON SOMEBODY

05:38.922 --> 05:40.381
WHEN THEY'RE SLEEPING.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.383
WHAT? NO, IT'S NOT.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.383
IT'S KISSING.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.385
"LAY ONE ON ME"

05:42.425 --> 05:44.385
MEANS "KISS ME."

05:44.427 --> 05:47.055
OH.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.474
WELL, YOU JUST EXPLAINED

05:47.097 --> 05:49.474
THREE OF MY LAST FOUR BREAKUPS.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.892
UGH.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.061
I GOT SOME TEXTS TO SEND.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.563
(Fox and June laugh)

05:55.605 --> 05:57.482
SO YOU GUYS DO HAPPY HOUR

05:55.605 --> 05:57.482
EVERY WEEK?

05:57.524 --> 05:59.442
MM. WELL, WE GENUINELY LIKE

05:57.524 --> 05:59.442
HANGING OUT TOGETHER.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.403
WE DO.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.403
WE REALLY SUPPORT EACH OTHER

05:59.484 --> 06:02.403
OUTSIDE OF WORK, TOO.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.489
JASON WRITES PLAYS.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.407
I MAKE AND SELL

06:04.531 --> 06:06.407
MY OWN LEATHER HEADBANDS.

06:06.449 --> 06:09.328
I LOVE HEADBANDS.

06:06.449 --> 06:09.328
MY COMPANY'S CALLED

06:06.449 --> 06:09.328

06:10.329 --> 06:11.913
(all laugh)

06:10.329 --> 06:11.913
THAT'S GREAT, RIGHT?

06:11.955 --> 06:13.832
WELL, YOU DON'T

06:11.955 --> 06:13.832
LOSE 50 POUNDS AND COUNTING

06:11.955 --> 06:13.832
HAVING A SECOND MARG.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.917
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

06:13.874 --> 06:15.917
NATURE CALLS.

06:15.959 --> 06:19.296
WOW, 50 POUNDS.

06:15.959 --> 06:19.296
THAT IS... AMAZING.

06:19.338 --> 06:22.341
I MEAN, HE STILL HAS A WAYS

06:19.338 --> 06:22.341
TO GO, BUT HE LOOKS FANTASTIC.

06:22.381 --> 06:24.259
I'LL TAKE THAT...

06:22.381 --> 06:24.259
THANK YOU.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.635
AND GIVE IT TO JUNE.

06:25.677 --> 06:26.427
OH!

06:26.469 --> 06:27.595
NEW KID ALWAYS PAYS.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.723
OH. (chuckles) OKAY.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.435
I GET IT. YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN

06:31.558 --> 06:34.435
YOUR FIRST PAYCHECK YET.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.313
LET ME TALK TO THE BARTENDER.

06:36.355 --> 06:38.232
I BET I CAN GET

06:36.355 --> 06:38.232
THAT LAST ROUND TAKEN OFF.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.441
I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD

06:38.273 --> 06:40.441
TO TAKE THE SUBWAY HOME.

06:40.483 --> 06:41.693
I HAVE TO WALK EVERYWHERE.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.737
HAD TO TAKE UP

06:41.735 --> 06:43.737
DEFENSIVE JUJITSU. (chuckles)

06:41.735 --> 06:43.737

06:58.960 --> 07:00.545
LAST NIGHT, WE WENT OUT

06:58.960 --> 07:00.545

07:00.587 --> 07:02.463

07:13.892 --> 07:15.560
THAT WAS SO WEIRD.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.478

07:21.524 --> 07:23.360
WHAT? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

07:23.402 --> 07:25.153
BECAUSE I'M YOUR NEMESIS.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.281
(continues typing)

07:27.322 --> 07:28.865
(stops typing)

07:27.322 --> 07:28.865
OKAY, LOOK, JUNE,

07:28.907 --> 07:30.491
I WORKED MY ASS OFF

07:28.907 --> 07:30.491
TO GET THIS JOB.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.785
OKAY,

07:30.533 --> 07:31.785
I'M NOT ABOUT TO LET

07:31.826 --> 07:33.870

07:33.912 --> 07:35.580
SWOOP IN AND OUTSHINE ME.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.749
I'M TAKING YOU DOWN.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.584
(sneezes loudly) AAH!

07:39.626 --> 07:41.295
AHH. (sniffs)

07:41.336 --> 07:44.505
I DO SNEEZE LIKE A BEAST.

07:41.336 --> 07:44.505
THAT PART IS TRUE. (sighs)

07:44.547 --> 07:45.548

CLINK, CLINK!

07:51.638 --> 07:53.514
(giggles)

07:53.556 --> 07:56.393
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT FOX PARIS.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.393
SHE HAS IT OUT FOR ME.

07:56.435 --> 07:58.728
FAKE SARCASTIC SHOCK,

07:56.435 --> 07:58.728
I WAS RIGHT?!

07:58.770 --> 08:01.606
DO YOU WANT ME TO CRUSH HER?

07:58.770 --> 08:01.606
BECAUSE I LIVE FOR THIS STUFF.

08:01.648 --> 08:05.235
JUST SAY WHEN, NAME THE TIME.

08:01.648 --> 08:05.235
IT HAS TO BE 4:00, SO NAME 4:00.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.528
(sniffs)

08:05.277 --> 08:07.528
IS THAT PEANUT BUTTER?

08:07.570 --> 08:08.529
LOOK,

08:07.570 --> 08:08.529
FOX IS JUST THREATENED,

08:08.571 --> 08:10.740
BUT I AM NOT GONNA

08:08.571 --> 08:10.740
STOOP DOWN TO HER LEVEL.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.452
I'M GONNA FIX THIS MY WAY.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.536
I AM GOING TO KILL HER...

08:13.493 --> 08:15.536
(gasps)

08:15.578 --> 08:16.913
WITH KINDNESS.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.913
OH.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.539
IT WORKED IN THE FIFTH GRADE,

08:16.955 --> 08:18.539
WHEN BECKY SHAW STARTED A RUMOR

08:18.581 --> 08:20.541
THAT MY BOOBS CAME IN

08:18.581 --> 08:20.541
UPSIDE-DOWN.

08:20.583 --> 08:24.921
SO I MADE CUPCAKES, I SHARED

08:20.583 --> 08:24.921
THEM WITH HER AT RECESS,

08:24.963 --> 08:27.632
AND SHE TOOK BACK EVERYTHING

08:24.963 --> 08:27.632
THAT SHE SAID.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.426
CUPCAKES?

08:29.468 --> 08:31.386
JUNE, I AM TALKING ABOUT

08:29.468 --> 08:31.386
LITERALLY CRUSHING A WOMAN.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.637
THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE BOTTOM

08:31.428 --> 08:32.637
OF THIS CUP, TOO.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.348
D-DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE A MAID?

08:34.389 --> 08:36.391
IF YOLANDA SAW THIS PLACE,

08:34.389 --> 08:36.391
SHE WOULD CRY.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.560
THAT'S  WHO YOLANDA IS!

08:36.433 --> 08:39.560
IT'S JAMES' MAID!

08:39.602 --> 08:41.855
I KNEW THERE WAS A YOLANDA.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.855
HOW IS SHE DOING ANYWAY?

08:41.896 --> 08:44.565
IS SHE STILL WITH TODD OR DID

08:41.896 --> 08:44.565
JORGE FINALLY MAKE HIS MOVE?

08:44.607 --> 08:45.817
TODD FOUND OUT ABOUT JORGE.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.489
ALL RIGHT.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.573
NEW DAY. CLEAR HEADS.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.950
WE'RE GONNA NAIL

08:52.615 --> 08:53.950
THIS CARD THING.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.952
I DIDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.287
I DON'T WANT TO NOT HAVE JUNE

08:55.994 --> 08:57.287
IN MY LIFE,

08:57.329 --> 08:59.289
BUT WHAT IF IT'S TOO SOON

08:57.329 --> 08:59.289
TO DATE HER?

08:59.331 --> 09:00.623
WHAT IF I'M NOT

08:59.331 --> 09:00.623
EMOTIONALLY READY?

09:00.665 --> 09:02.792
I TOTALLY GET IT. HOW COULD

09:00.665 --> 09:02.792
YOU PUT SOMETHING IN HERE

09:02.834 --> 09:05.212
IF YOU DON'T KNOW

09:02.834 --> 09:05.212
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

09:05.253 --> 09:07.881
WE GOTTA BACK IT UP, TO ACTING,

09:05.253 --> 09:07.881
THE MOTHER OF WRITING.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.799
ALL RIGHT? LET'S ROLE-PLAY.

09:09.841 --> 09:12.635
JAMES, COME ON.

09:09.841 --> 09:12.635
JUST TRY IT.

09:09.841 --> 09:12.635
YOU BE MARK. I'LL BE JUNE.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.971
I DON'T--

09:12.677 --> 09:14.971
IT'S HARD, I KNOW.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.971
IT'S SCARY.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.307
BUT...

09:15.013 --> 09:17.307
WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.976
NO WRONG INSTINCTS.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.976
JUST TOTAL SAFE ZONE.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.769
OKAY, FINE.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.230
(breathes deeply)

09:23.271 --> 09:25.315
JUNE, I--

09:23.271 --> 09:25.315
YES, MARK?

09:25.357 --> 09:26.691
WELL, YOU...

09:26.733 --> 09:28.860
REALLY MEAN A LOT TO ME,

09:26.733 --> 09:28.860
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW--

09:28.902 --> 09:30.695
HOW COULD YOU PUT THIS ON ME

09:28.902 --> 09:30.695
RIGHT NOW?!

09:30.737 --> 09:32.447
I JUST STARTED A NEW JOB!

09:32.489 --> 09:34.408
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

09:32.489 --> 09:34.408
HOW STRESSFUL THAT IS?!

09:34.449 --> 09:36.410
PLUS YOU JUST BROKE UP

09:34.449 --> 09:36.410
WITH JENNIFER!

09:36.451 --> 09:38.745
AM I YOUR REBOUND SLUT?!

09:36.451 --> 09:38.745
I HATE YOUR GUTS!

09:39.871 --> 09:42.665
(exhales deeply)

09:44.459 --> 09:46.627
THAT FELT GREAT. LET'S PICK THIS

09:44.459 --> 09:46.627
BACK UP TOMORROW.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.713
(door opens, bells jingle)

09:49.714 --> 09:50.882
"DEAR ALLEN,

09:50.924 --> 09:52.633

(pen clicks)

09:58.932 --> 10:01.518
YOO-HOO! NEIGHBOR!

10:01.560 --> 10:03.270
HEY. I MADE YOU THESE.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.688
THEY ARE "WE GOT OFF

10:03.311 --> 10:05.688

10:05.730 --> 10:08.024
SEE THE FOOT? (chuckles)

10:08.066 --> 10:09.943
TRUCE? WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:09.984 --> 10:11.486
MM.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.654
I THINK YOU'RE TRYING

10:11.528 --> 10:13.654
TO KISS MY ASS.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.866
MWAH! MWAH! MWAH!

10:16.908 --> 10:18.368
NO...

10:16.908 --> 10:18.368
MWAH!

10:18.410 --> 10:19.369
THAT IS NOT...

10:18.410 --> 10:19.369
MMM! MMM.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.661
WHAT I...

10:20.703 --> 10:22.663
MR. HARKIN.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.666
JUNE PUT A CUPCAKE ON MY CHAIR.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.666
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.919
MAYBE IT WAS SOME SORT OF PRANK

10:25.708 --> 10:27.919
TO FIT IN?

10:27.961 --> 10:31.047
UNPROFESSIONAL, JUNE.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.047
TIGHTEN UP.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.673
THAT IS NOT

10:31.089 --> 10:32.673
A SEXUAL ADVANCE.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.717
SIR, NO, THAT IS--THAT'S NOT

10:32.715 --> 10:34.717
WHAT HAPPENED.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.553
UH, I GUESS THERE'S

10:34.759 --> 10:36.553
A FRUIT BASKET

10:36.595 --> 10:38.888
WITH AN APOLOGY NOTE FROM YOU

10:36.595 --> 10:38.888
TO ALLEN IN THE MEN'S BATHROOM?

10:38.930 --> 10:41.891
KINDA HOT IN THERE.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.891
NOT IDEAL FOR MELON.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.603
APOLOGY  UNACCEPTED.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.527
AND THEN SHE CHANGED

10:49.732 --> 10:52.527
MY OUTGOING VOICE MAIL MESSAGE

10:52.569 --> 10:54.779
TO, "HI, THIS IS JUNE.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.779
I'M SORRY I MISSED YOU.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.531
I'M GETTING AN ABORTION"!

10:56.573 --> 10:58.699
(knock on door)

10:58.741 --> 11:00.701
I GOT A PACKAGE

10:58.741 --> 11:00.701
FOR JUNE COLBURN.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.701
THAT'S... ME.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.288
OH, MY GOD! WHAT IS IT?!

11:00.743 --> 11:03.288
OPEN IT! OPEN IT!

11:03.330 --> 11:04.705
(tape rips)

11:04.747 --> 11:07.292
(gasps) IT'S A BOX OF SNAKES!

11:07.334 --> 11:09.336
OH.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.336
IT'S JUST LEATHER HEADBANDS.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.712
THAT'S FOX PARIS' SIDE BUSINESS.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.714
BUT I-I DIDN'T ORDER ANY--

11:11.754 --> 11:13.714
LET ME GUESS.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.592
YOU LEFT HER ALONE WITH

11:13.756 --> 11:15.592
YOUR CREDIT CARD AT SOME POINT.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.511
(whispers) HAPPY HOUR.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.513
(inhales sharply)

11:17.552 --> 11:19.513
OH! SCREW KINDNESS.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.432
THIS GIRL IS MY NEMESIS,

11:19.554 --> 11:22.432
AND SHE IS GONNA GO DOWN.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.225
GOT IT. ON IT.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.225
LET ME PUT ON SOME BOOTS.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.602
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.728
I'M GONNA DO THIS MYSELF.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.357
BUT WHAT--WHAT--WHAT DO YOU

11:27.770 --> 11:30.357
THINK I SHOULD DO?

11:30.398 --> 11:33.610
OKAY, YOU NEED TO PHOTOSHOP

11:30.398 --> 11:33.610
HER HEAD ON A NAKED GIRL.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.778
HOW DO I GET THAT?

11:33.652 --> 11:35.778
JUST TYPE ANYTHING

11:33.652 --> 11:35.778
INTO THE INTERNET.

11:35.820 --> 11:36.737
LITERALLY ANYTHING.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.739
"MOUSE." "HAT." "SANDWICH."

11:36.779 --> 11:38.739
ANYTHING.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.368
(Chloe) WHEN SHE LEAVES

11:40.158 --> 11:41.368
HER CUBE TO PEE,

11:41.409 --> 11:42.743
JUMP ON HER COMPUTER

11:42.785 --> 11:45.746
AND SEND THE PICTURE

11:42.785 --> 11:45.746
TO MR. HARKIN FROM HER E-MAIL.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.831
SUBJECT LINE--

11:46.873 --> 11:50.793
"GET AN EYEFUL OF THIS,

11:46.873 --> 11:50.793
BOSS MAN!"

11:50.835 --> 11:52.753
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:50.835 --> 11:52.753
YOU PEE FAST!

11:52.795 --> 11:55.756
PLEASE DON'T PRESS "SEND."

11:52.795 --> 11:55.756
PLEASE. IT'LL DESTROY MY CAREER.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.759
I KNOW THINGS HAVE GOTTEN

11:55.798 --> 11:58.759
OUT OF HAND,

11:58.801 --> 12:00.803
BUT I AM BEGGING YOU.

12:00.845 --> 12:01.762
PLEASE?

12:01.804 --> 12:03.557
(whispers) OKAY.

12:03.598 --> 12:04.641
(growls)

12:03.598 --> 12:04.641
WHOA!

12:04.683 --> 12:06.142
(click, beep)

12:04.683 --> 12:06.142
AHH.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.185
AAH! AAH! UHH!

12:07.227 --> 12:08.769
(thud)

12:08.811 --> 12:10.813
(panting)

12:10.855 --> 12:12.399
I NEVER PEE.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.401
(telephone rings)

12:14.442 --> 12:15.943
(breathes heavily)

12:15.985 --> 12:17.654
(ring)

12:17.696 --> 12:20.615
(Chloe) What the hell was that?!

12:17.696 --> 12:20.615
You had her and you let her go!

12:20.657 --> 12:21.782
I KNOW! BUT SHE...

12:21.824 --> 12:23.410
WAIT. HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

12:21.824 --> 12:23.410
WHERE ARE YOU?

12:23.451 --> 12:24.785
Well, I wanted to see

12:23.451 --> 12:24.785
how this all went down,

12:24.827 --> 12:26.287
SO I'M YOUR 4:00 MEETING.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.248
SEE ON YOUR SCHEDULE--

12:26.329 --> 12:28.248
PARKINS AND SONS?

12:28.289 --> 12:30.791
I MADE UP THAT NAME. IT SOUNDS

12:28.289 --> 12:30.791
PRETTY BAD OUT LOUD, HUH?

12:30.833 --> 12:33.503
(sighs) I CAN'T DO THIS.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.503
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

12:33.545 --> 12:34.879
JUST... (whispers) PLEASE.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.632
(normal voice)

12:34.921 --> 12:37.632
TAKE CARE OF IT FOR ME?

12:37.674 --> 12:39.634
ABOUT TIME.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.634
NOW GET OUTTA HERE.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.802
YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANNA

12:39.676 --> 12:41.802
BE AROUND TO SEE THIS.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.054
OKAY.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.810
FOX PARIS?

12:47.850 --> 12:49.810
YES?

12:49.852 --> 12:52.397
I'M CHLOE.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.397
SO?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.566
YEAH. SO.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.821
(laughter)

13:00.863 --> 13:02.449
AAH!

13:02.490 --> 13:04.825
(laughter continues)

13:04.867 --> 13:06.202
OH! HEY, JUNE.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.828
(door closes)

13:06.244 --> 13:07.828
YOUR HALF

13:06.244 --> 13:07.828
OF THIS APARTMENT SUCKS.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.080
CHLOE'S IS AWESOME. (giggles)

13:09.122 --> 13:11.332
EXCUSE ME WHILE I USE

13:09.122 --> 13:11.332
THE LADIES'.

13:11.374 --> 13:14.294
GOOD LUCK FINDING YOUR CONCEALER

13:11.374 --> 13:14.294
TOMORROW, BAG EYES.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.088
CHLOE, WHAT...

13:17.130 --> 13:18.923
OHH. OKAY.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.341
YOU ARE PRETENDING

13:18.965 --> 13:20.341
TO BEFRIEND FOX

13:20.383 --> 13:22.843
SO WE CAN ATTACK HER

13:20.383 --> 13:22.843
FROM BOTH SIDES.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.845
BURROW IN ON THE WORK FRONT,

13:22.885 --> 13:24.845
BURROW IN ON THE FRIEND FRONT,

13:24.887 --> 13:26.847
AND THEN BLOW HER UP

13:24.887 --> 13:26.847
FROM THE MIDDLE!

13:26.889 --> 13:27.848
THAT COULD NOT BE

13:26.889 --> 13:27.848
MORE WRONG.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.101
I'M SORRY. I KNOW I SAID

13:27.890 --> 13:30.101
I WOULD DESTROY FOX,

13:30.143 --> 13:31.686
BUT IT TURNS OUT

13:30.143 --> 13:31.686
SHE'S AWESOME.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.896
(whispers) WHAT?

13:31.728 --> 13:33.896
HEY, CHLOE.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.483
LOOK AT ME! I'M JUNE.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.483
(laughs)

13:36.524 --> 13:38.735
(high-pitched voice)

13:36.524 --> 13:38.735
'TEW! 'TEW!

13:36.524 --> 13:38.735
(laughs)

13:38.777 --> 13:41.446
(imitates British accent)

13:38.777 --> 13:41.446
I LIKE NUMBERS. I LIKE TEA.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.365
(squeals) THAT'S THE PERFECT

13:41.488 --> 13:44.365
JUNE! THAT'S DEAD-ON!

13:44.407 --> 13:46.867
OH, WELL, THIS HAS BEEN GREAT,

13:44.407 --> 13:46.867
BUT I GOTTA GO.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.328
YEAH, YOU SHOULD GET

13:46.909 --> 13:48.328
SOME REST.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.871
SHE'S DEALING

13:48.369 --> 13:50.871
WITH A REAL DUD AT WORK.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.457
UGH.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.457
(chuckles)

13:52.499 --> 13:53.792
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:53.832 --> 13:56.336
I STOLE YOUR ROOMMATE.

13:53.832 --> 13:56.336
I'M STEALING YOUR CLOTHES.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.756
I'LL TAKE EVERYTHING YOU OWN.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.756
(giggles) I'LL DESTROY YOU.

13:59.798 --> 14:02.883
NIGHT, CHLO! LOVE YA, GIRL!

14:02.925 --> 14:03.884
(door closes)

14:03.926 --> 14:05.094
SHE GAVE ME A WIG!

14:05.136 --> 14:06.887
♪ OOH, LA-LA-LA ♪

14:06.929 --> 14:08.097
(door slams)

14:12.935 --> 14:13.894
WHAT THE HELL?

14:13.936 --> 14:16.105
YOU WERE SUPPOSED

14:13.936 --> 14:16.105
TO TAKE FOX PARIS DOWN

14:16.147 --> 14:18.983
AND NOT INVITE HER OVER

14:16.147 --> 14:18.983
TO OUR APARTMENT FOR DRINKS.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.902
OKAY, WELL, WHEN YOU TOLD ME

14:19.025 --> 14:21.902
ABOUT YOUR WORK SITUATION,

14:21.944 --> 14:23.988
YOU LEFT OUT A LOT

14:21.944 --> 14:23.988
OF VERY IMPORTANT DETAILS.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.907
LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU SING

14:24.030 --> 14:26.907
WHEN YOU STAPLE? UGH!

14:26.949 --> 14:30.620
OR THAT FOX PARIS' COUSIN'S

14:26.949 --> 14:30.620
THE DRUMMER FOR blink-182.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.997
BUT... SHE IS MY NEMESIS!

14:33.039 --> 14:36.000
SWEETIE, IT'S OKAY.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.000
WE'LL GET YOU A NEW ONE.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.586
YOU CAN HAVE ANY KIND

14:36.042 --> 14:38.586
YOU WANT--

14:38.628 --> 14:40.630
TALL, SHORT, FAT, THIN.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.591
(gasps) ACTUALLY, YOU'D BE

14:40.672 --> 14:43.591
REALLY FUNNY WITH A FAT ONE.

14:43.633 --> 14:44.925
(scoffs)

14:44.967 --> 14:46.636
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

14:46.678 --> 14:48.596
FOX PARIS IS A MONSTER

14:48.638 --> 14:50.014
WHO'S TRYING TO GET ME FIRED

14:48.638 --> 14:50.014
AT HARKIN,

14:50.056 --> 14:52.600
AND CHLOE DECIDED

14:50.056 --> 14:52.600
TO BE HER FRIEND, AND--

14:52.642 --> 14:53.768
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M HEARING,

14:52.642 --> 14:53.768
JUNE?

14:53.810 --> 14:54.935
A LOT OF SHENANIGANS

14:54.977 --> 14:56.937
AND VERY LITTLE

14:54.977 --> 14:56.937
ABOUT ACTUAL WORK.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.607
BUT SHE--

14:56.979 --> 14:59.607
WHAT ABOUT

14:56.979 --> 14:59.607
ALL THE PREP WE DID, HUH?

14:59.649 --> 15:01.609
THIS JOB MEANS EVERYTHING

14:59.649 --> 15:01.609
TO YOU.

15:01.651 --> 15:02.943
YOU'RE SUPPOSED

15:01.651 --> 15:02.943
TO BE SHOWING HARKIN

15:02.985 --> 15:04.654
THAT YOU'RE AT THE TOP

15:02.985 --> 15:04.654
OF YOUR GAME,

15:04.696 --> 15:07.114
NOT  PLAYING  GAMES.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.659
YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:09.701 --> 15:12.953
IT SHOULD BE ABOUT THE JOB,

15:09.701 --> 15:12.953
NOT ABOUT ALL THE STUPID DRAMA.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.749
FROM NOW ON, I'M JUST GOING

15:12.995 --> 15:15.749
TO FOCUS ON THE WORK

15:15.790 --> 15:17.876
AND KEEP MY HEAD DOWN.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.253
THANK YOU, ELI.

15:26.843 --> 15:27.968
MY MOM'S SICK.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.929
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.643
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA HAVE

15:33.307 --> 15:35.643
A BREAKTHROUGH. I CAN FEEL IT.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.772
OKAY, BUT I GOTTA SAY,

15:35.685 --> 15:38.772
I'M REAL UNCOMFORTABLE.

15:38.813 --> 15:39.814
IT'S GOOD

15:38.813 --> 15:39.814
YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE.

15:39.856 --> 15:40.981
THAT MEANS

15:39.856 --> 15:40.981
WE'RE OPENING UP DOORS.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.984
NOW HANDS ON KNEES.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.069
NOT YOUR KNEES. MY KNEES.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.613
(sighs deeply)

15:46.654 --> 15:49.198
ALL RIGHT. NOW...

15:49.240 --> 15:51.075
WE'RE GONNA GET INSIDE THE MAN

15:49.240 --> 15:51.075
AND FIND THE BOY.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.787
THIS FEELS WEIRD.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.787
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

15:53.828 --> 15:55.037
I DON'T KNOW, ACTUALLY.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.206
JUST SOMETHING ONE OF MY FIRST

15:55.079 --> 15:57.206
ACTING TEACHERS HAD ME DO

15:57.248 --> 15:59.500
WHEN I WAS JUST STARTING OUT.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.043
IT'S A...

16:06.841 --> 16:07.926
OH.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.010
BREAKTHROUGH?

16:07.967 --> 16:10.010
I THINK I NEED TO LEAVE.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.391
(Chloe and Fox laugh)

16:15.433 --> 16:17.101
SERIOUSLY, FOXY,

16:15.433 --> 16:17.101
LUNCH WAS AMAZING.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.853
MMM. ANY TIME, PARKINS.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.855
(laughs)

16:18.895 --> 16:20.855
THAT'S WHAT EXPENSE ACCOUNTS

16:18.895 --> 16:20.855
ARE FOR.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.650
ABUSING COMPANY FUNDS.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.653
SO WHERE IS THIS FAMOUS

16:23.691 --> 16:26.653
BATTERY FRIDGE I'VE HEARD ABOUT?

16:26.694 --> 16:28.028
MM. OVER THERE.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.029
(singsongy) TIME FOR CAKE!

16:29.071 --> 16:31.407
1 PIECE, 20 POINTS,

16:29.071 --> 16:31.407
NO DINNER!

16:31.449 --> 16:33.952
CAKE? NO, I CAN'T. TOO BUSY.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.120
GOTTA FOCUS ON

16:33.993 --> 16:36.120
WHAT'S IMPORTANT--THE WORK.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.204
AH, SUIT YOURSELF.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.039
I'LL JUST TELL HARKIN

16:37.246 --> 16:39.039
YOU MISSED HIS CAKE

16:39.081 --> 16:41.542
'CAUSE YOU HATE HIS GUTS.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.542
HARKIN? IT'S HARKIN'S BIRTHDAY?!

16:41.584 --> 16:42.669
SAVE.

16:41.584 --> 16:42.669
(clicks key)

16:42.710 --> 16:43.962
SAVE.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.254
SAVE. OH!

16:44.003 --> 16:45.254
(beep)

16:45.296 --> 16:48.048
CRAP! I JUST OPENED

16:45.296 --> 16:48.048
THE DVD PLAYER!

16:48.090 --> 16:51.135
YAY! (giggles)

16:51.177 --> 16:55.139
THIS IS JUST A SMALL TOKEN OF

16:51.177 --> 16:55.139
APPRECIATION FROM ALL OF US--

16:55.181 --> 16:56.683
EXCEPT FOR JUNE,

16:55.181 --> 16:56.683
WHO JUST CAME IN LATE.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.559
I GUESS SHE DOESN'T CARE

16:56.724 --> 16:58.559
ABOUT YOUR BIRTHDAY.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.060
WELL, THAT'S MEAN

16:58.601 --> 17:00.060
OF YOU, JUNE.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.479
NO, I WAS SAVING DOCUMENTS.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.482
JUNE, GO AHEAD AND CUT 50 PIECES

17:01.521 --> 17:04.482
OF CAKE FOR EVERYONE. THANKS!

17:04.524 --> 17:06.734
WAIT. W-WHY DO I HAVE TO

17:04.524 --> 17:06.734
DO THIS?

17:06.776 --> 17:09.069
I WANT THE CORNER PIECE,

17:06.776 --> 17:09.069
BUT I WANT THE "I" IN MY NAME,

17:09.111 --> 17:10.738
AND I WANT IT DOTTED

17:09.111 --> 17:10.738
WITH THAT ROSE.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.073
(laughs) GO AHEAD, JUNE.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.535
(indistinct conversations)

17:15.576 --> 17:16.452
NO.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.579
UM... EXCUSE ME?

17:18.621 --> 17:20.080
I AM NOT YOUR SERVER.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.709
YOU  CUT THE CAKE

17:20.122 --> 17:22.709
IF YOU WANT IT SO BADLY.

17:22.750 --> 17:23.751
HOW'S THAT CAKE COMING?

17:23.793 --> 17:26.086
TERRIBLY, SIR.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.086
JUNE REFUSES TO--

17:26.128 --> 17:28.172
CUT THE B.S., FOX.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.172
CUT MR. HARKIN'S CAKE,  JUNE.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.340
SOMEBODY PUT CAKE IN MY MOUTH!

17:29.382 --> 17:31.509
THERE'S MELON  AND  CAKE?!

17:31.551 --> 17:34.804
CUT HARKIN'S CAKE NOW OR I WILL

17:31.551 --> 17:34.804
MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL

17:34.846 --> 17:37.557
TILL YOU EITHER QUIT

17:34.846 --> 17:37.557
OR GET FIRED.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.100
NOW FOR YOUR PRESENT.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.100
(giggles)

17:40.142 --> 17:42.102
NOW JUNE DIDN'T WANT

17:40.142 --> 17:42.102
TO GO IN WITH US,

17:42.144 --> 17:44.898
BUT THE REST OF US GOT YOU

17:42.144 --> 17:44.898
LEATHER WRIST CUFFS.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.941
(laughs)

17:44.939 --> 17:46.941
(man) OH! OH, HO HO HO!

17:46.983 --> 17:49.819
THOSE ARE HEADBANDS, SIR.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.819
THEY'RE FOR GIRLS.

17:49.861 --> 17:50.987
(under breath)

17:49.861 --> 17:50.987
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:51.029 --> 17:52.279
YOU CANNOT INTIMIDATE ME.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.991
YOU CAN STEAL MY ROOMMATE,

17:52.321 --> 17:54.991
CHARGE UP MY CREDIT CARD,

17:55.033 --> 17:57.117
DESTROY MY RELATIONSHIP

17:55.033 --> 17:57.117
WITH ALLEN...

17:55.033 --> 17:57.117
(clears throat)

17:57.159 --> 17:58.912
BUT I WILL NOT COW

17:57.159 --> 17:58.912
TO YOUR GAMES...

17:57.159 --> 17:58.912
(speaks indistinctly)

17:58.953 --> 18:01.330
BECAUSE I CAME

17:58.953 --> 18:01.330
TO HARKIN FINANCIAL TO WORK.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.374
NOW YOU CUT THE DAMN CAKE!

18:01.372 --> 18:03.374
(squish)

18:03.416 --> 18:04.584
(man gasps)

18:03.416 --> 18:04.584
AAH!

18:04.625 --> 18:06.002
(gasps)

18:06.044 --> 18:07.294
(murmuring)

18:06.044 --> 18:07.294
(gasps)

18:07.336 --> 18:08.504
(knife clatters)

18:07.336 --> 18:08.504
YOU STABBED ME!

18:08.546 --> 18:11.591
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

18:08.546 --> 18:11.591
I AM  SO  SORRY!

18:11.632 --> 18:12.759
YOU STABBED ME IN THE BACK!

18:12.800 --> 18:14.301
SOMEONE CALL 9-1-1!

18:14.343 --> 18:16.429
(mouth full)

18:14.343 --> 18:16.429
HOLY HELL, THIS IS AMAZING.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.138
I'M SORRY I PUT YOUR FRUIT

18:16.470 --> 18:18.138
IN THE BATHROOM.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.974
(crying) WHAT IS HAPPENING?!

18:18.180 --> 18:19.974
YOU'RE DYING.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.813
WE KNOW IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

18:22.435 --> 18:25.813
BUT JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE,

18:25.855 --> 18:27.189
IF YOU NEED TO OPEN

18:25.855 --> 18:27.189
ANY LETTERS,

18:27.231 --> 18:29.609
YOU CAN COME DOWN TO H.R.,

18:27.231 --> 18:29.609
AND I'LL DO IT.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.947
HEY. HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

18:33.988 --> 18:35.197
WELL, YOU GOT ME...

18:35.239 --> 18:38.576

18:35.239 --> 18:38.576

18:38.618 --> 18:42.622
FOX, I AM  SO  SORRY.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.164
DON'T BE.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.750
LOOK... (sighs)

18:45.792 --> 18:49.169
I MAY NEVER, EVER,

18:45.792 --> 18:49.169
EVER  LIKE YOU,

18:49.211 --> 18:51.672
BUT I'M GONNA

18:49.211 --> 18:51.672
LEAVE YOU ALONE...

18:51.714 --> 18:53.340

18:51.714 --> 18:53.340
'CAUSE YOU CRAZY.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.426

18:59.597 --> 19:01.808
UH, NO.

19:49.939 --> 19:53.026

BUT YOU TELL ME

20:43.325 --> 20:45.078

horns honking in distance)
