WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:01.827
ALL: (HIGH-PITCHED VOICES)
Boop. Bop.

00:03.212 --> 00:05.544
Okay, I don't want
to overstate this,

00:05.839 --> 00:08.501
but these have to be the
best wedding gift bags ever.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.165
It's gonna be hard to beat
Gwyneth Paltrow's wedding.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.959
| heard they gave away
beautiful charcoal drawings

00:12.262 --> 00:13.718
of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Ooh.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.345
| can't believe
Brooke's getting married.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.052
We've never even met
this Elliot guy.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.716
| can't believe Jane and
Alex have an older sister.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.930
| mean, we never see her,
never talk about her,

00:21.230 --> 00:23.187
she never shows up
in any of your flashbacks.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.190
Flashbacks? That's what Jane
and Alex call their photo albums.

00:26.485 --> 00:27.941
God, Penny. Know what
things are called for once.

00:28.237 --> 00:29.944
Trust me,
Brook is very real.

00:30.239 --> 00:32.526
She has a perfect job
in Hong Kong.

00:32.824 --> 00:33.939
Her hair smells like a perfect
beach made of cinnamon.

00:34.243 --> 00:35.654
She is perfect.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.535
And as maid of honor,
| need this wedding to be...

00:37.829 --> 00:38.944
Say it with me...

00:39.248 --> 00:41.330
ALL: Perfect.
Pearl Harbor.

00:41.625 --> 00:44.162
Pearl Harbor! 'Cause we want
this wedding to be da bomb! Nope.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.041
Just like that Michael
Bay movie "Armageddon.”

00:45.337 --> 00:46.827
What?

00:47.130 --> 00:49.371
Jane, you're acting extra
nuts, and I'm not talking about

00:49.675 --> 00:51.791
"mistaking the teaspoon with
the tablespoon” kinda nuts.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.005
I'm talking about "Mel Gibson
downing a 5-hour energy

00:54.304 --> 00:56.545
"and by accident showing up
at a bar mitzvah" kinda nuts.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.259
Brooke makes Jane crazy.
She out-Janes Jane.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.640
She shows up,
becomes the Jane,

00:59.935 --> 01:00.925
Jane gets bumped down
to Alex's level.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.684
And I just stay the baby.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.095
Look what Brooke got me so I
wouldn't be jealous of her ring.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.104
Oh, a little suck candy.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.731
I'm just glad
| got invited.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.608
Like, I've known Brooke my
whole life and looked up to her,

01:09.903 --> 01:11.234
but I didn't know that
she would remember me.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.487
She doesn't. You and
Max are my plus-twos

01:13.782 --> 01:14.396
and you're gonna have to
park some cars.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.031
(WHINES) Jane!

01:16.326 --> 01:17.236
Babe, everything's gonna
be fine, all right?

01:17.536 --> 01:18.617
I'll be right by your side.

01:18.912 --> 01:19.652
I'll even let
your racist cousins ask me

01:19.955 --> 01:20.660
if I know Blair Underwood.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.617
(LAUGHS)

01:22.916 --> 01:24.623
Like... Like all black people
are friends are somethin'.

01:24.918 --> 01:25.453
(LAUGHS) I mean, come on.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.915
God, I wish I was friends
with Blair Underwood.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.251
(OVEN TIMER RINGING)
J Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

01:31.550 --> 01:33.040
S Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

01:33.343 --> 01:35.209
(RINGING STOPS)
My clay beads are ready!

01:35.512 --> 01:36.923
How many of you cool cats
wanna help me crank out

01:37.222 --> 01:38.678
a few necklaces?

01:38.974 --> 01:40.840
Oh! Oh, my goodness.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.554
Yes, oh, my goodness.
(SNIFFS)

01:42.853 --> 01:43.809
I'm working with
some polymers right...

01:46.148 --> 01:46.888
Hey. What the...

01:48.942 --> 01:49.898
Alex, I can see you hiding.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.022
Can you still see me?

01:53.322 --> 01:53.982
Yes. Even more now.

01:54.948 --> 01:55.779
Fine!

01:56.700 --> 01:57.405
Nice try, though.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.447
So... (SIGHS)

02:00.746 --> 02:02.862
(THUD)

02:03.165 --> 02:04.781
When are we gonna tell
everybody about the thing?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.573
What thing?

02:06.877 --> 02:07.867
The thing about
how we broke up.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.205
Oh, right.

02:09.503 --> 02:10.369
(THUD)
That thing.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.970
Wow.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.179
So this is really happening.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.853
We're breaking up.

02:28.148 --> 02:28.808
Yeah, when you say it out
loud like that,

02:29.107 --> 02:30.222
it just really sinks in.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.855
Like when I found out
Gossip Girl was a guy.

02:34.154 --> 02:34.814
(SIGHS) Totally.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.363
So we both agree,
we don't tell everyone

02:38.659 --> 02:40.275
until after your
sister's wedding, right?

02:40.577 --> 02:42.909
Yeah, it would be too much
of a distraction. (SIGHS)

02:43.205 --> 02:44.991
Plus, my family
is SO gossipy

02:45.290 --> 02:46.496
and they always
get the story wrong.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.703
Remember that one time you
said you like Sinead O'Connor,

02:49.002 --> 02:49.958
and by the time
it got back to us,

02:50.253 --> 02:51.869
you were teaching Wicca
at a women's college?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.458
You were the only one
that I told.

02:53.757 --> 02:54.337
Exactly.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.175
Strength, courage,
composure, no carbs.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.801
Strength, courage,
composure, no carbs.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.053
(DOORBELL RINGS)
(EXHALES) Uh-huh.

03:01.348 --> 03:01.928
Here we go.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.511
Hi, Brooke.

03:04.810 --> 03:05.800
Jane.
Oh!

03:06.103 --> 03:07.719
Welcome to my home!

03:08.021 --> 03:09.477
BROOKE: Thank you.

03:09.773 --> 03:13.311
And you must be
black... Elliot. Black Elliot?

03:13.610 --> 03:15.897
Yes. That's just a nickname
that we'll stop using immediately.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.403
(CHUCKLES) Thank you for
having us to your home, Jane.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.110
Have you been renovating?
Hmm?

03:20.409 --> 03:22.446
Because it looks like everything's
covered with a thin layer of dust.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.234
Oh! (LAUGHS)
Ah.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.324
Good catch. Yeah, I must've
just cleaned thoroughly

03:26.623 --> 03:27.658
instead of compulsively.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.869
Brooke!
Hello.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.704
Gimme some love, girl.
(CHUCKLES) Nice to see you.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.119
So good to see you.
(CHUCKLES)

03:34.423 --> 03:35.959
And look what
you brought home.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.043
Mmm!
Ah. (CHUCKLES)

03:37.342 --> 03:37.956
An Elliot.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.342
Hello, everyone.
ALEX: Hi!

03:40.637 --> 03:41.718
Ah. Finally, another Elliot.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.424
(LAUGHS)
Yeah.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.260
| haven't hung out with another
Elliot in, like, two years, man.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.799
Mmm.
(CHUCKLES)

03:47.102 --> 03:48.263
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
(LAUGHS)

03:48.562 --> 03:49.723
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Uh-oh.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.056
You know, he even
smells like an Elliot.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.438
Ah. Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
(LAUGHS) Yeah. Yeah.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.849
Yeah, this is good.
Hey, yo, E. Mmm?

03:55.152 --> 03:56.017
Can I ask you
a question, man?

03:56.319 --> 03:57.525
(CHUCKLES) What's up?

03:57.821 --> 04:00.233
(STOMPS FEET)
A little somethin' somethin'?

04:00.532 --> 04:01.397
Please do.
(LAUGHS)

04:02.743 --> 04:04.404
What we be ea yin'
when they ain't around?

04:06.955 --> 04:08.411
| said, I said...

04:08.707 --> 04:10.914
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) What
we be ea yin' when they ain't around?

04:12.502 --> 04:13.708
White people be crazy?

04:14.004 --> 04:15.711
Yeah, they do!

04:16.005 --> 04:17.997
(LAUGHING)
(LAUGHS)

04:18.300 --> 04:20.632
Aah! I knew you gon' know!

04:20.927 --> 04:22.132
(LAUGHS)
They do be crazy, though!

04:22.429 --> 04:23.635
Some do.
Y'all do.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.716
(FORCED LAUGH)
(LAUGHS)

04:26.016 --> 04:26.756
Yeah, let's get you
a drink, my Elliot.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.093
All right, I'm with that.
Brooke!

04:28.393 --> 04:29.428
Little sis!
Hey!

04:29.728 --> 04:32.140
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.975
(GASPS) What'd you bring
me? What'd you bring me? On!

04:34.274 --> 04:36.140
Chinese rice candy.
You can eat the wrapper!

04:36.443 --> 04:38.525
Shut up!
Mmm-hmm.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.402
That'll save me
SO much time.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.318
| love you, sis.
| love you, too.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.903
Yay!
PENNY: Hey, girl.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.738
Uh, hi,
I'm Brooke Kerkovich.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.744
It's an...
(LAUGHS)

04:49.039 --> 04:50.575
Hi. Okay.
Oh! (LAUGHS)

04:50.874 --> 04:52.581
Brooke, Penny Hartz!

04:52.876 --> 04:53.832
(GIGGLES) I slept over
at your house a lot.

04:55.712 --> 04:56.668
Oh, I wrote that paper
on you in seventh grade.

04:57.756 --> 04:58.917
Oh! You hit me
with your car,

04:59.216 --> 05:00.798
and I had to wear
a leg brace all summer.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.674
Oh, yes. That's right.
What leg was that again?

05:02.969 --> 05:04.505
(GIGGLES) The left.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.091
No. Sorry, I'm thinking
of someone else.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.881
Yeah, totally.

05:09.184 --> 05:09.969
Yeah, I was thinking
of someone else, too.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.102
So much blonde.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.182
(PLASTIC CRINKLES)
(MOUTH FULL) Hold on. Sit down.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.224
(LOWERED VOICE)
She's an odd one. Yes.

05:18.527 --> 05:19.608
So have you talked to Dad?

05:19.903 --> 05:21.610
| can't believe
he threw his back out.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.191
He's immobilized. He's
not coming to the wedding.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.651
(GRUNTS) Should we postpone?

05:24.950 --> 05:26.782
Postpone? At this stage?

05:27.077 --> 05:27.987
(SCOFFS)
Jane, is that a joke?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.949
Yep. (LAUGHS)

05:31.248 --> 05:33.364
So... How are
the rehearsal dinner plans?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.658
Perfect. Everything is done
to your specifications.

05:35.961 --> 05:36.996
Where's Mom sitting?
Away from the band,

05:37.295 --> 05:38.376
so she doesn't try to
join them for a song.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.833
Flowers?
Hypoallergenic.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.713
All tears should be caused
by the bride's glory.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.498
Kids' table?
There isn't one.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.009
Children should be seen and
not heard and also not seen.

05:47.138 --> 05:47.923
Good.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.131
(GASPS)

05:52.477 --> 05:53.182
Ah.

05:54.563 --> 05:55.724
Hi, Mom!

05:56.022 --> 05:57.888
Well. Hi, sweetie.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.182
(LAUGHS)
Hey, Janie!

06:00.485 --> 06:02.317
Hey, Dad.
How you feeling?

06:02.612 --> 06:04.319
Amazing.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.481
Have you guys seen "Night at the
Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian”?

06:07.784 --> 06:10.651
Because it is
a masterstroke.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.446
Your dad's on a lot
of fancy pills right now.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.489
He's really not himself.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.282
Hey, Barb,
take me for a spin.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.702
Show me what the hell else
I'm paying for in this joint.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.370
Yep, he's still
pretty much himself.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.959
Yeah.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.669
Are there possibly
any other rooms available

06:24.968 --> 06:26.003
for this weekend?
WOMAN: Let me check.

06:26.303 --> 06:26.838
Why do you need
another room?

06:27.137 --> 06:28.923
Oh. Uh...

06:29.222 --> 06:30.804
You know,
'cause Dave and I just...

06:31.099 --> 06:34.558
Have so much sex that
we need a cooldown room.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.639
Okay, nobody has
that much sex.

06:36.938 --> 06:37.803
Who do you think you are,
the Fonz?

06:38.106 --> 06:38.891
(LAUGHS)

06:40.734 --> 06:42.941
Okay, fine. Dave and |
broke up last week.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.603
Oh, my God! | can't
believe it! Are you okay?

06:45.906 --> 06:47.943
Yeah. I think.
| don't know.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.108
Oh! Sweetie, I'm so sorry.
What happened?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.321
Well, we were talking about
Brooke's wedding

06:52.621 --> 06:53.406
and then we got locked
in our bedroom.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.491
Again?
It's a old building.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.407
The doors expand, the wood
separates, and we're idiots!

06:58.710 --> 06:59.575
(DOOR RATTLES)

07:01.838 --> 07:03.328
| can't believe Brooke's
marrying this Elliot guy

07:03.632 --> 07:04.713
after only, like, a year.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.498
It's kind of fast, right?

07:06.801 --> 07:08.963
Well, they both dated a lot
of people before they met.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.343
So when they met each other,
they just knew.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.425
Like when I met the
bloomin onion, | just knew.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.549
Well, we never really dated
anybody else.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.805
I'll check
the bathroom window.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.849
(SCOFFS) What...
What do you mean?

07:24.152 --> 07:26.985
| mean, we dated other people
during our break. (DOOR CLOSES)

07:27.280 --> 07:29.396
Well, I didn't really date.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.316
| would call it a series of
mind-blowing sexual experiences

07:32.619 --> 07:35.156
with a lot of beautiful women.
What about you?

07:35.455 --> 07:36.616
Yeah, I had one guy, like,
feel me up.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.280
What? It's fine.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.699
Over or under the bra?
Whatever!

07:41.002 --> 07:44.165
Was he quick with the clasp?
Doesn't matter, David.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.080
| guess we didn't really
have a true break.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.623
We're basically each other's
rebound relationship.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.335
What are you saying?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.174
| don't know.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.214
| mean, Brooke and Elliot knew
that they were right for each other

07:55.517 --> 07:56.803
'cause they both had
other real relationships.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.304
This window's still jammed.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.438
Let's... Let's try
the bedroom door again.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.691
(DOOR RATTLES)
Oh, come on!

08:06.987 --> 08:07.943
See, Dave? This is why I
don't shut the bathroom door

08:08.238 --> 08:09.273
when I'm in here.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.313
Wow. I am floored.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.106
So...
Shh!

08:13.410 --> 08:14.115
Okay, Dave and I swore that
we wouldn't tell anyone

08:14.411 --> 08:14.991
until after the wedding.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.367
BOTH: Hey!

08:16.663 --> 08:17.778
MAX AND DAVE: Hey!

08:19.207 --> 08:20.993
Hey... Back up a sec.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.703
This is huge.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.290
Alex just lets it rage
with the bathroom door open?

08:25.588 --> 08:27.170
(BLOWS AIR) Batter move!

08:27.465 --> 08:28.796
Max.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.548
Sorry. I guess
| just got used to

08:30.844 --> 08:31.879
you two dummies being
back together.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.669
You okay?
Yeah. I guess.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.929
In a way, it was kinda good.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.057
You know, being locked in
that room for a couple hours

08:39.352 --> 08:40.717
really forced us to finally
deal with our stuff.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.555
So are we really
doing this?

08:44.858 --> 08:45.689
Yeah, I guess so.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.184
It sucks but it feels right.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.477
You don't regret getting
back together, do you?

08:50.780 --> 08:52.236
No. Of course not.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.897
(WHISPERS) Okay.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.690
| would've regretted
if we stayed together

08:55.994 --> 08:57.985
just because of momentum.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.369
Oh, then we'd be right back
where we started.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.450
| don't want to
go through that again.

09:01.750 --> 09:02.410
| don't even know
where I'd find a guy

09:02.709 --> 09:03.494
who wears
rollerblades anymore.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.371
Too soon.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.455
(LAUGHS)

09:07.297 --> 09:07.911
Let's get out of here.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.747
Yep.
| mean really!

09:10.050 --> 09:10.585
(DOOR RATTLES)
(GASPS)

09:10.884 --> 09:12.466
Oh! What?

09:12.761 --> 09:15.173
Seriously? Come on!

09:15.472 --> 09:15.961
Why'd we close
this door anyway?

09:16.264 --> 09:17.754
It felt right!

09:18.058 --> 09:19.048
You're right. It did.
(DOOR RATTLES)

09:23.813 --> 09:27.898
As promised, your
perfect rehearsal dinner.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.308
Is this seating chart
laminated?

09:29.611 --> 09:32.319
Yep. I got my own machine.
No big.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.400
| did splurge
for the newest model.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.030
I'll stop bragging.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.693
Oh, yeah, I'm a card-carrying
member of the lami-nation.

09:38.995 --> 09:39.860
We even have
our own constitution,

09:40.163 --> 09:41.528
which can't we amend...

09:41.831 --> 09:43.071
'Cause it's laminated.
(LAUGHS)

09:44.793 --> 09:46.283
Isn't laminating
just a bit... Tacky?

09:48.213 --> 09:50.500
W...w...what about
for spills and stuff?

09:50.799 --> 09:52.381
How about instead of
protecting it from spills,

09:52.675 --> 09:54.086
we just don't spill,
right?

09:54.385 --> 09:55.466
Yeah. Yes.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.799
That's a good idea. You...
Good note, Brooke!

09:59.099 --> 09:59.679
(CHUCKLES)

10:00.850 --> 10:02.591
(UNDER BREATH)
Lamination, Jane?

10:02.894 --> 10:04.134
Why don't you just
cover it in glitter, you...

10:04.437 --> 10:05.097
(WHISPERS) Cheap whore?

10:07.190 --> 10:08.772
Hello, gay sir.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.308
Hello,
Countess Vonboobs.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.602
| have a secret, but I
shan't be telling you.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.021
| have a secret as well,

10:16.324 --> 10:18.110
and it's a real
doozie kurtz.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.945
My secret's so big, just
the tip will be enough.

10:20.245 --> 10:21.110
Yes, well, is your secret
bigger than the fact

10:21.412 --> 10:22.197
that Alex and
Dave broke up?

10:22.497 --> 10:23.578
Damn it, Max!
Come on.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.079
That was my secret, too!
Damn it, Penny!

10:25.375 --> 10:26.536
Why do people
tell us stuff?

10:26.835 --> 10:29.702
Did I hear you say that Alex
and Dave are breaking up?

10:30.004 --> 10:32.245
I'm sorry. I'm Alex's
second cousin Sherry.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.337
(LAUGHS) No, actually,
we did not say that.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.625
| think you might've
heard wrong.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.339
You see, Sherry...
(CHUCKLES)

10:38.638 --> 10:39.924
Alex and Dave are not
so much breaking up

10:40.223 --> 10:42.635
as they are...
BOTH: Breaking Ground.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.299
Ground on an addition
on their home.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.593
Are they starting a family?

10:46.896 --> 10:48.182
Because I knew
that I heard someone

10:48.481 --> 10:50.142
talking about a
pregnancy in the bathroom.

10:50.441 --> 10:51.897
BOTH: Sherry,
| gotta tell ya...

10:52.193 --> 10:53.399
No. You're on the nose here.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.560
(CHUCKLES)
Detective work is great.

10:54.863 --> 10:55.978
Sherlock Sherry.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.147
They're pregnant.
Super preggers.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.939
Sperm has fertilized
the egg.

11:00.243 --> 11:03.907
Right now, her uterus is
creating a nutrient-rich lining

11:04.205 --> 11:05.821
to house and protect
the young fetus.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.241
But do me a favor,
Sher Bear?

11:09.544 --> 11:10.784
Why don't we just
keep this a secret

11:11.087 --> 11:11.701
between the three
of us, huh?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.330
Great.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.374
Turn it and throw it away. Mmm.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.838
(WHISPERS) How could
you start a rumor like that?

11:19.137 --> 11:20.343
And how do you know
so much about uteruses?

11:20.638 --> 11:22.379
Uteri.
You're a woman.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.014
You should know which part
of the butt the baby comes from.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.677
And look, this secret
cannot get out.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.686
And right now, I'm feeling
a lot of heat in our direction.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.597
(EXHALES) We need to
deflect it. Change the news cycle.

11:31.900 --> 11:32.890
| was sniff in'
what you were whiff in'.

11:33.193 --> 11:33.773
Penny, don't.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.190
(SCOFFS)
(MEN LAUGH)

11:38.489 --> 11:41.197
Look at him.
Elliot's got it so easy...

11:41.492 --> 11:42.732
Because of all
the work I did.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.401
| put up with
all their weird questions

11:44.704 --> 11:46.490
and made them feel
comfortable around a black guy.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.655
Oh, my God.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.995
I'm the Jackie Robinson
of the Kerkovich family.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.125
Sure. That's not
a leap at all.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.707
| broke down
barriers, okay?

11:55.006 --> 11:57.293
And Elliot should have
to go through what I did.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.175
Actually, the true legacy
of Jackie Robinson

12:00.470 --> 12:02.711
is that Elliot shouldn't have
to go through what you did.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.721
| believe it was Medgar
Evers who once said...

12:05.016 --> 12:06.472
Dude, we get it. You
minored in black history.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.759
Afro-American Studies.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.019
And I am offended by
your use of the term "minor."

12:11.314 --> 12:12.850
Now is not the time, man!

12:15.568 --> 12:16.399
(EXHALES)

12:20.365 --> 12:21.400
All right,
Dr. Berg,

12:21.699 --> 12:24.407
| know you delivered
every child in this family,

12:24.702 --> 12:25.817
but you're in
the wrong seat.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.576
So I'm gonna need you
to make like George Clinton

12:27.872 --> 12:28.737
and get the funk
outta here.

12:29.040 --> 12:29.871
Jane.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.281
Yeah?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.541
Why are you
freaking out on Dr. B.?

12:33.836 --> 12:35.076
Because I put everyone
in the wrong place

12:35.380 --> 12:36.916
because the seating chart
is ruined.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.296
What?
| had to unlaminate it,

12:38.591 --> 12:39.501
and then I got
those weird sweats

12:39.801 --> 12:41.508
that I only get
when Brooke's around.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.010
Well, that explains why
Mom ended up by the band.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.171
J Oh, when the saints
Keep me out of this.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.431
I Go marching in
Not happening.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.388
J Oh, when the saints
go marching... No.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.270
(MOUTHS)

12:53.564 --> 12:56.397
J I wanna be there
in that number

12:56.693 --> 12:59.560
J When the saints
go marching in J

12:59.862 --> 13:00.818
Hallelujah!

13:01.114 --> 13:02.525
So...
(GASPS)

13:02.824 --> 13:04.940
The seating is
a complete mess,

13:05.243 --> 13:07.075
and I'm pretty sure that woman
doesn't even belong here.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.610
You bought me
my first maxi pad.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.529
Aw!

13:10.832 --> 13:11.822
Jane,
it's very clear to me

13:12.125 --> 13:13.286
that the pressure
is getting to you,

13:13.584 --> 13:15.291
and I think we need
to give you a simpler task.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.791
Let go.
Let go.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.831
(PAPER THUDS) Instead of
helping me get ready tomorrow,

13:21.134 --> 13:22.169
| think it would be better
if you handed out programs.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.964
And you...
Yeah?

13:25.263 --> 13:26.594
...are doing a
wonderful job. On!

13:26.889 --> 13:27.629
(CHUCKLES) Thank you. Mmm-hmm.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.598
(STAMMERS)
Yeah, that's a good plan.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.429
(SCOFFS)

13:32.729 --> 13:33.890
(CLEARS THROAT) Aw,
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

13:34.188 --> 13:35.349
I'm good.
Okay.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.683
I'm really good.
Yeah. I gotta...

13:36.983 --> 13:37.723
Actually, | gotta
check on... Okay.

13:38.026 --> 13:38.936
The thing in the...

13:41.612 --> 13:42.352
Okay, big boy,
let's go.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.486
(STRAINED VOICE)
Let's go.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.397
Are you serious?

13:45.700 --> 13:46.656
Elliot knows
Blair Underwood?

13:46.951 --> 13:48.362
Oh, yeah.
Wow.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.072
And he loves it when
people ask him about it. On!

13:50.371 --> 13:51.577
(SINGSONGY)
Here he comes.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.534
Hey, Elliot. You know
Blair Underwood?

13:53.833 --> 13:54.368
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
What? What?

13:54.667 --> 13:55.748
Oh! (SCOFFS)

13:56.044 --> 13:58.081
What? What? He... Ah!

13:58.379 --> 13:59.665
(WHISPERS)
Oh, my gosh.

13:59.964 --> 14:00.999
(NORMAL VOICE) Like all black
people are just supposed to know

14:01.299 --> 14:02.289
Blair Underwood, huh?

14:02.592 --> 14:04.674
Uh... Actually,
| do know Blair.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.711
He's a great guy. He's a
spokesman for a charity I work with.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.722
Wow! That is very
impressive, Elliot.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.052
(CHUCKLES) The stories
you must have, huh?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.137
What? No!
(ELLIOT LAUGHS)

14:14.937 --> 14:15.802
The stories are stupid!

14:16.105 --> 14:16.594
I'm impressive!

14:17.815 --> 14:19.101
I'm Jackie Robinson!

14:21.444 --> 14:22.900
Mmm...

14:23.196 --> 14:25.563
So, Alex...
Drinking, huh?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.105
In your condition?
Isn't that...

14:27.408 --> 14:29.024
Uh, acceptable
in Europe? Yes.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.783
How very French
of you, Alex.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.410
| guess it is.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.322
Ooh, la la! Pepe Le
Pew! French Stewart!

14:35.625 --> 14:37.115
And, Alex,
how are your cravings?

14:37.418 --> 14:38.704
Insane.
Totally insane.

14:39.921 --> 14:40.456
Thank you for asking.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.336
Um, this rarely happens.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.592
| feel like
I'm missing something.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.969
Like that time that everybody
turned on linen pants

14:50.264 --> 14:51.049
all of a sudden. (IN
HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) No. No. No.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.174
No, I don't, uh...

14:54.477 --> 14:55.308
PENNY: Okay,
what are we gonna do?

14:55.603 --> 14:56.343
We need to change
the news cycle again.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.307
(GASPS)

14:58.606 --> 14:59.516
| have an idea.

15:00.650 --> 15:01.685
Hey! Hey!
Hmm?

15:01.984 --> 15:03.440
Scuttle your butt
on over here, Sher.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.352
| got some grade-A goss,

15:05.655 --> 15:07.862
but you have it keep
it a secret. Okay?

15:08.157 --> 15:10.273
Jane and Brad
are on the rocks.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.566
You tastin'
what I'm wastin'?

15:11.869 --> 15:12.609
Pen, come on.
Just...

15:12.912 --> 15:13.947
Just don't tell anybody.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.362
Oh! Your secret's
safe with me.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.574
(LOWERED VOICE)
This better work, Max.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.208
(LOWERED VOICE)
Give it time. Give it time.

15:21.504 --> 15:22.494
(ALL WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)

15:36.185 --> 15:37.721
(LOWERED VOICE)
So this is hush-hush,

15:38.020 --> 15:39.351
but Brad and Jane
are divorcing

15:39.647 --> 15:40.637
because Brad
has a love child.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.978
Wow.
That was fast.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.108
They really
took it and ran.

15:45.403 --> 15:46.108
Yeah, but you know what I liked?

15:46.404 --> 15:47.314
They really
made it their own.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.527
Hello.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.032
Do not fold that!
It's not garbage.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.913
It's a guide
to your magical afternoon.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.040
Hey, um,
so Brooke heard

16:01.335 --> 16:02.825
that you were making
people feel uncomfortable.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.119
So she thought
it'd be better

16:04.422 --> 16:05.583
if you just let the
podium do your job.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.873
(MUTTERS) Sorry, Jane. | just...

16:09.177 --> 16:10.292
| lucked out that,
you know,

16:10.595 --> 16:11.756
| was born for this
whole flower girl gig.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.007
(GRUNTS)

16:15.892 --> 16:19.135
It's not at all how or when
you're supposed to do that.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.973
REVEREND: Brooke, Elliot,
we've reached the big moment.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.606
Elliot, do you take Brooke to
be your lawfully wedded wife?

16:28.571 --> 16:29.902
| do.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.609
(LOWERED VOICE)
No, no, no, no.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.740
REVEREND: And you, Brooke, take
Elliot to be your lawfully wedded husband?

16:34.035 --> 16:35.241
No!

16:35.536 --> 16:36.992
What?
No, no, not them.

16:37.288 --> 16:37.902
There is a fire,
and...

16:39.248 --> 16:41.205
Programs are on fire.
(GASPS)

16:41.501 --> 16:43.993
Everyone stay here.
I'm a volunteer firefighter.

16:44.295 --> 16:45.660
(IN NASAL VOICE) I'm
a volunteer firefighter.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.044
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Keep
reading us your resume, dude.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.705
(HISSING)

16:49.008 --> 16:50.498
Dave,
get Alex out of here.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.417
The fumes are bad
for the baby.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.882
Hey! I know I'm the
baby of the family,

16:55.181 --> 16:56.671
but I'm a big girl! If I can
get through a corn maze,

16:56.974 --> 16:57.964
| can get out of here.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.678
No,
the baby you're having.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.638
ALL: What?
(GUESTS GASP)

17:01.938 --> 17:03.895
No, it's Brad and Jane
that are having the baby.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.430
ALL: What?
(GUESTS GASP)

17:05.733 --> 17:07.223
No! It's a love child that
Brad has with some floozy.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.232
That's why they're
getting divorced.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.893
(GUESTS GASP)
ALL: What?

17:10.195 --> 17:11.685
I'm not having
a love child!

17:11.989 --> 17:12.523
Well, then
who's breaking up?

17:13.406 --> 17:14.363
Dave and I are.

17:14.659 --> 17:15.319
What?
(GUESTS GASP)

17:15.617 --> 17:16.779
| know. I...

17:17.078 --> 17:18.864
We should've told
all of you sooner, but...

17:19.163 --> 17:20.618
| have no idea where these
other stories came from.

17:20.915 --> 17:21.950
Max and Penny told us.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.205
Ah.

17:23.501 --> 17:24.741
Okay, well...
Right.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.829
Look, I'm sorry. | had to
change the news cycle,

17:27.128 --> 17:28.493
like how I told
everyone Penny was 53.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.500
Oh, come on!
No gasps on that?

17:33.803 --> 17:34.793
Well, then who did
| overhear

17:35.096 --> 17:36.507
talking about a baby
in the bathroom?

17:36.806 --> 17:38.171
| know
it's a Kerkovich girl.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.930
It wasn't me.
It was not me.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.466
It's me. All right?
(GUESTS GASP)

17:41.769 --> 17:42.383
I'm pregnant.

17:43.354 --> 17:44.515
(SPRINKLERS HISS)

(GUESTS SCREAMING)

17:48.317 --> 17:49.057

17:51.320 --> 17:53.277
(LOUDLY) Brooke,

17:54.282 --> 17:55.397
Who are you?

17:59.245 --> 18:00.451
(LIGHT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

18:08.254 --> 18:09.619
How you holding up?

18:09.922 --> 18:10.912
Well, my shotgun
wedding got soaked.

18:11.757 --> 18:12.872
Yeah.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.256
(INHALES DEEPLY)

18:14.552 --> 18:16.168
Look, I know you think
I'm perfect,

18:16.470 --> 18:17.426
but I'm actually not.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.387
You happy?
No.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.764
Yes. Very much.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.767
| Know I've always been
a little bit hard on you,

18:26.689 --> 18:28.225
but it's because I knew
how much potential you had.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.061
| knew you could be great.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.646
Maybe even better than me.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.151
(SCOFFS)

18:34.447 --> 18:35.403
That's why
| had to destroy you.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.240
(LAUGHS)
That is the nicest thing

18:39.535 --> 18:41.776
you have ever said to me.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.740
Well, you deserve it. Hmm.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.247
Plus, you only sort
of ruined my wedding.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.953
Max and Penny
really ruined it.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.334
She remembered me!
(LAUGHS)

18:50.630 --> 18:51.540
(TRAY CLATTERS)
Oh!

18:51.839 --> 18:53.329

18:53.633 --> 18:54.464
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

Again,
I'm so happy for you.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.344
BRAD: Hey, yo, E.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.755

19:08.648 --> 19:09.854
And look, I know
you being here first

19:10.149 --> 19:11.355

easier for me.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.109
Well... Although, now
that you've knocked up

19:14.403 --> 19:15.893
a Kerkovich daughter
out of wedlock...

19:16.197 --> 19:17.028
(EXHALES SHARPLY) You're
gonna have it plenty rough.

19:17.323 --> 19:17.778

19:31.462 --> 19:33.248
Barb and I are thrilled!

19:33.547 --> 19:35.754
It sure is taking
Brad long enough.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.587
It makes you wonder
what's wrong with his stuff.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.172
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
My stuff is fine!

19:40.471 --> 19:41.461
Don't worry
about my stuff!

couples, the fake couples,

19:51.232 --> 19:53.189

took a single loving peen pic

camera in this room.

Congratulations, Brooke and Elliot!

20:00.324 --> 20:01.610

child with some tramp.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.205
