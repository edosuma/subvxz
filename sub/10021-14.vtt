00:07.294 --> 00:08.386
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:08.595 --> 00:10.062
I offer up my services.

00:10.264 --> 00:13.529
The burns are well-healed.
Tell me how it happened.

00:13.734 --> 00:17.033
You put the patient first.
That's what we're supposed to do.

00:17.237 --> 00:21.367
When you prescribe schedule-two
narcotics, we cosign the order.

00:21.575 --> 00:23.805
We should arrange for a PCA.

00:24.011 --> 00:27.310
Hook Ricky up to an IV that would
deliver pain medication at home.

00:27.514 --> 00:28.776
Sign off on the Dilaudid.

00:28.983 --> 00:31.816
I can't sign off on that.
He's not on our service.

01:10.591 --> 01:11.580
Hey.

01:14.094 --> 01:15.186
Doug?

01:19.266 --> 01:21.860
- What time is it?
- It's almost 6.

01:22.069 --> 01:23.832
It's very strong.

01:25.472 --> 01:26.803
How's Ricky?

01:27.007 --> 01:28.804
He's still alive.

01:30.110 --> 01:33.170
- How's Joi?
- She's not so good.

01:33.947 --> 01:36.177
It's amazing he made it
through the night.

01:37.451 --> 01:39.976
I've gotta get to work.
What time's your shift?

01:40.554 --> 01:41.885
Seven.

01:42.956 --> 01:44.253
I'll see you there.

01:53.901 --> 01:55.163
Doug?

01:59.339 --> 02:00.533
Thanks.

02:00.941 --> 02:02.033
For what?

02:03.444 --> 02:05.173
For staying last night.

02:43.016 --> 02:46.110
I love this time of night,
just before dawn.

02:46.887 --> 02:49.355
So quiet, peaceful.

02:51.024 --> 02:53.083
When they're babies,
it's the best time.

02:53.293 --> 02:55.090
You complain about it...

02:56.063 --> 02:58.156
...but it's when you're
closest to them.

02:58.465 --> 03:01.901
Singing to them in the dark, nursing.

03:05.005 --> 03:05.994
Get any sleep?

03:07.307 --> 03:08.706
I must have.

03:09.309 --> 03:12.369
I closed my eyes for a moment,
and he was laughing.

03:12.579 --> 03:17.482
He was getting up to go to school,
kidding me about how much I worry.

03:17.684 --> 03:19.549
He always used to do that.

03:19.753 --> 03:23.814
Try to cheer me up, make me laugh.

03:26.493 --> 03:27.619
Oh, God...

03:29.696 --> 03:33.291
- When was his last booster?
- An hour ago. It won't give me more.

03:37.604 --> 03:38.730
Mommy?

03:40.707 --> 03:43.938
- Go back to sleep, sweetheart.
- I'm thirsty.

03:44.411 --> 03:46.743
I'll get you a drink of water, okay?

03:49.516 --> 03:51.711
It's okay, buddy.

03:53.954 --> 03:55.444
I'll take care of you.

04:08.468 --> 04:09.935
Dr. Ross?

04:10.737 --> 04:12.261
I increased the Dilaudid.

04:12.472 --> 04:15.066
It'll make it more difficult
for him to breathe.

04:23.784 --> 04:27.550
I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

04:31.091 --> 04:32.319
Will you please...

04:33.026 --> 04:34.516
...help us?

04:38.165 --> 04:39.530
Please?

04:43.570 --> 04:46.630
I can't watch him suffer anymore.

04:49.509 --> 04:51.374
He's suffered enough.

04:52.813 --> 04:54.144
No more.

04:55.449 --> 04:56.575
No more.

05:53.407 --> 05:57.503
<i>Recent springlike temperatures will</i>
<i>give way to freezing rain and snow.</i>

05:57.711 --> 06:01.044
Oh, man! I'm supposed to go
ice fishing tonight.

06:01.248 --> 06:03.682
Al and I are supposed to
go to Wisconsin to ski.

06:03.884 --> 06:06.318
Skiing in Wisconsin?
That's an oxymoron.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.954
Cross-country. It's great exercise.

06:09.156 --> 06:12.922
You're the moron. Sitting on the lake
in winter with your pole.

06:13.126 --> 06:15.026
"Oxymoron."
It's a figure of speech...

06:15.228 --> 06:18.493
...in which contradictory
terms or ideas are combined.

06:18.699 --> 06:22.601
I know what it means. I think
you're a fool for freezing on a lake.

06:22.803 --> 06:25.897
Who gave him that
"Improve Your Vocabulary" calendar?

06:26.106 --> 06:28.973
I did. It broadens his horizons.
What's today's word?

06:29.176 --> 06:32.043
Today's word is:

06:34.915 --> 06:37.179
"Ratiocination."

06:37.384 --> 06:40.444
That's gonna come in handy
in daily conversation.

06:40.654 --> 06:42.747
Has anyone seen Carol?

06:42.956 --> 06:44.753
It's "ratiocination."

06:44.958 --> 06:49.827
And it's "to reckon, to reason,
especially using formal logic."

06:50.030 --> 06:51.497
Jesuit high school.

06:52.165 --> 06:53.757
Hathaway's in Sutures.

06:53.967 --> 06:55.935
You're kidding! "Rocket" Romano?

06:56.136 --> 06:59.902
It's temporary until your committee
finds a permanent department head.

07:00.107 --> 07:02.940
- Why Romano?
- What? What about Romano?

07:03.143 --> 07:05.168
Anspaugh's made him Acting Chief.

07:05.379 --> 07:06.539
Of Emergency Medicine?

07:06.747 --> 07:10.183
Hey, I'm not happy about it either.
He's an egotistical, arrogant...

07:10.384 --> 07:13.512
...mean-spirited,
sexist little bullet-head.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.620
Good morning, doctors.

07:15.822 --> 07:18.848
News of my recent appointment
precedes me, I take it.

07:19.059 --> 07:21.857
What? No popping of champagne?
No ticker tape?

07:22.062 --> 07:23.689
Excuse me. I have a patient.

07:23.897 --> 07:26.457
Looking forward to working
together again, Maggie.

07:26.833 --> 07:29.768
I took the liberty of reassigning
a few minor tasks.

07:29.970 --> 07:33.667
Greene, you'll handle chart review,
Residents and medical students...

07:33.874 --> 07:36.035
...timecards and patient complaints.

07:36.243 --> 07:38.871
Dr. Weaver, joint commission
report is due.

07:39.079 --> 07:42.276
I'd like a weekly census divided
into Surgery, Pedes, and Medicine.

07:42.482 --> 07:46.350
I'd like a daily list of all consults.
You'll sit on the budget committee...

07:46.553 --> 07:49.545
...and handle all billing questions
and insurance approvals.

07:49.756 --> 07:50.814
What do you do?

07:51.024 --> 07:53.424
I supervise you. Delegation:

07:53.627 --> 07:56.687
One of the eight hallmarks
of effective leadership.

07:56.897 --> 08:00.025
Well, if you need me
I'll be in surgery.

08:00.233 --> 08:01.257
Oh...

08:03.770 --> 08:05.032
"Bullet-head."

08:07.474 --> 08:09.965
I'm offended.
Aren't you, Dr. Greene?

08:10.177 --> 08:12.202
Deeply, deeply wounded by your...

08:12.412 --> 08:14.175
...callous and uncaring remark.

08:14.381 --> 08:17.373
In fact, I might have to start
an investigation...

08:17.584 --> 08:20.348
...and interview others
who might have been hurt...

08:20.554 --> 08:22.818
...by your vicious invective
in the past.

08:27.494 --> 08:29.462
This is gonna be fun.

08:31.731 --> 08:34.198
Just get his coat and sweater off.

08:35.368 --> 08:37.836
IKid eats nothing but
French fries and pizza.

08:38.038 --> 08:40.438
The mom doesn't understand
why he's constipated.

08:41.408 --> 08:43.342
So how was Ricky when you left?

08:43.543 --> 08:44.703
Alive.

08:45.445 --> 08:47.913
I better go. I'm behind already.

08:48.348 --> 08:50.282
- Lunch?
- Sure.

08:51.885 --> 08:55.082
You sure look beautiful.
How do you do that without sleep?

08:55.288 --> 08:56.778
Good genes.

08:57.257 --> 08:58.884
You look like hell.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.951
- It's a chick flick.
- It's romantic.

09:02.162 --> 09:03.686
Isn't it four hours long?

09:03.897 --> 09:05.888
The special effects are great.

09:06.099 --> 09:08.590
- IKate Winslet gets naked.
- That's encouraging.

09:08.802 --> 09:11.168
- What you got?
- Fender bender. Tender abdomen.

09:11.371 --> 09:13.635
- Have you seen <i>Titanic</i> ?
- Chick flick.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.241
That's what I said. Lucy rented it,
wants me to watch it with her.

09:17.444 --> 09:21.175
Leonardo DiCaprio, hoop skirts
and tragic love is my idea of hell.

09:21.381 --> 09:24.612
Whatever happened
to the sensitive '90s male?

09:24.818 --> 09:27.651
The ones who love romantic
candlelight dinners?

09:27.854 --> 09:29.754
They're all gay, aren't they?

09:29.956 --> 09:33.255
I don't want to ruin it, Dale,
but in the end, the ship sinks.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.155
I hate you both.

09:37.731 --> 09:39.392
Nice package, huh?

09:39.833 --> 09:41.824
So, you two getting serious?

09:42.335 --> 09:43.700
She is.

09:45.572 --> 09:47.096
Have you two...?

09:48.174 --> 09:49.232
Consummated?

09:49.442 --> 09:53.276
I couldn't discuss it if I had.
It would damage her reputation.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.072
I'll tell you this much, though:

09:55.849 --> 09:57.373
Thongs.

09:57.951 --> 10:01.387
When the lighting's right,
you can see through her scrubs.

10:04.558 --> 10:06.185
<i>"E." "S."</i>

10:06.393 --> 10:08.293
Make it a little rounder.

10:08.728 --> 10:10.286
Yeah. "E."

10:10.997 --> 10:12.396
Reece.

10:15.569 --> 10:16.536
That's hard.

10:16.736 --> 10:18.499
You'll get the hang of it.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.468
How long will it take?

10:20.674 --> 10:25.202
It depends on how much you practice.
You're learning a new language.

10:25.645 --> 10:29.376
- Reece is already getting it.
- He's a kid. It's easier.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.813
He wants to communicate.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.912
That's it for today.

10:36.122 --> 10:38.283
How often should we...

10:38.491 --> 10:39.515
- You and me?
- Yeah.

10:39.726 --> 10:42.752
I would recommend three times a week.

10:42.963 --> 10:44.988
A hundred and fifty bucks a week?

10:46.132 --> 10:48.692
There's good video available.

10:48.902 --> 10:51.928
But I think one-on-one is better.

10:55.508 --> 10:57.669
Mr. Ekabo, how are you?

10:58.745 --> 10:59.643
Fine.

10:59.846 --> 11:01.711
How did it go with the urologist?

11:04.384 --> 11:05.942
Did you see the doctor?

11:06.219 --> 11:07.846
Yeah. Everything's good.

11:09.556 --> 11:12.787
If you have any questions
about a procedure...

11:12.993 --> 11:17.054
...or what the doctor's telling you,
I'd be happy to answer them.

11:19.666 --> 11:21.395
No questions. No.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.641
You didn't go see the urologist,
did you, Mr. Ekabo?

11:32.512 --> 11:33.809
Why not?

11:38.318 --> 11:42.220
I have not told my wife about
my needing a doctor.

11:43.590 --> 11:45.353
She will be frightened.

11:45.558 --> 11:47.617
Would you like me to explain it to her?

11:50.630 --> 11:53.292
- You would do that?
- I'd be happy to.

11:53.633 --> 11:55.931
We got a kid coming in. Full arrest.

11:56.136 --> 11:58.229
- How long?
- Coming up now.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.532
Bring your wife around.

12:02.308 --> 12:03.969
We'll talk.

12:04.177 --> 12:08.204
Then we can go ahead
and set up that urologist appointment.

12:09.315 --> 12:10.577
Okay?

12:13.353 --> 12:15.844
Where's that snow we're
supposed to get?

12:16.056 --> 12:19.025
You know what they say:
The calm before the storm.

12:19.225 --> 12:22.752
Eight-year-old male found unresponsive
in bed at home.

12:22.962 --> 12:25.294
Asystole, began CPR in the field.

12:25.498 --> 12:27.056
- Joi?
- What do we got?

12:27.267 --> 12:28.962
End-stage ALD. He's Doug's patient.

12:29.169 --> 12:32.468
- How long has he been down?
- We got him 15 minutes ago.

12:32.839 --> 12:37.139
He wasn't expected to make it.
His mother wanted him to die at home.

12:37.343 --> 12:39.334
Joi, why did you call the paramedics?

12:39.546 --> 12:40.535
I didn't.

12:40.747 --> 12:43.875
Do you want us
to use extraordinary measures?

12:44.084 --> 12:46.314
- No, I don't.
- But I do.

12:46.519 --> 12:48.180
- Who are you?
- Ricky's father.

12:49.022 --> 12:52.514
Your son is at the end stages
of a painful terminal illness.

12:52.726 --> 12:55.456
Extending his life will only
prolong his agony.

12:55.662 --> 12:57.527
Doctor, please don't let him die.

12:57.731 --> 12:59.460
Intubation kit.

13:02.669 --> 13:03.761
The leg isn't broken.

13:03.970 --> 13:06.734
- I need you.
- They're much tougher than you think.

13:08.608 --> 13:12.442
Ricky Abbott's back. His father is
insisting we resuscitate him.

13:12.645 --> 13:15.409
Carol, what meds is he on?
Where's Carol?

13:15.615 --> 13:16.582
She left to get Doug.

13:16.783 --> 13:18.410
He's on Dilaudid for the pain.

13:18.618 --> 13:20.643
Two milligrams of Narcan.

13:20.854 --> 13:25.257
Chuny, why don't you take
Mr. And Mrs. Abbott to Chairs?

13:25.458 --> 13:26.356
What's going on?

13:26.559 --> 13:28.959
Mr. Abbott asked us to try
to resuscitate.

13:29.162 --> 13:30.686
Atropine. Two of epi.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.626
He shouldn't have made it
through the night.

13:32.832 --> 13:36.131
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Dr. Ross. He was in my care.

13:36.336 --> 13:37.234
Son of a bitch!

13:37.437 --> 13:39.428
Get him out of here!

13:39.639 --> 13:41.072
Get your hands off me.

13:43.576 --> 13:45.510
Still flatline.

13:46.946 --> 13:48.243
Oh, please.

13:50.850 --> 13:52.215
Please.

13:54.587 --> 13:56.384
Sorry, Mr. Abbott.

13:56.856 --> 13:59.381
Time of death, 9:42.

14:14.307 --> 14:17.834
You'll need a couple of sutures.
You want me to get Plastics?

14:18.044 --> 14:19.671
No, you can do it.

14:20.814 --> 14:22.179
What was that all about?

14:22.382 --> 14:24.475
I didn't even know there was a father.

14:24.684 --> 14:25.673
Is he gonna be okay?

14:25.885 --> 14:27.853
A couple of stitches.

14:28.054 --> 14:29.214
How's Mike Tyson?

14:29.422 --> 14:31.913
He went to make a phone call,
took the girl.

14:32.125 --> 14:34.320
Did Joi mention there was a father?

14:34.527 --> 14:36.518
She told me they were separated.

14:37.430 --> 14:39.421
You went down like a brick.

14:39.632 --> 14:41.862
Cheap shot.
Guy caught me off balance.

14:42.068 --> 14:44.263
I didn't realize you had a glass jaw.

14:44.470 --> 14:45.494
<i>Child support...</i>

14:45.939 --> 14:48.908
...my med school loans.
I don't know how I'll shake it.

14:49.108 --> 14:51.633
How much do you have to pay
in school loans?

14:51.845 --> 14:53.107
Over 120 grand.

14:53.313 --> 14:54.837
Oh, that's barbaric.

14:55.048 --> 14:58.916
Payment's 700 a month.
That's a quarter of my take-home pay.

14:59.118 --> 15:02.281
Money woes, Peter?
Every Resident's chief complaint.

15:02.488 --> 15:05.082
I'll never understand
this country's insistence...

15:05.291 --> 15:08.158
...on forcing its highly-trained
Residents to live in poverty.

15:08.361 --> 15:13.196
Only way the public health system can
afford to provide care the freeloaders.

15:13.399 --> 15:16.368
By freeloaders, you mean people
without education...

15:16.569 --> 15:19.265
...job training, children
and the infirm.

15:19.472 --> 15:21.201
Like I said, freeloaders.

15:21.407 --> 15:24.467
You are a despicable human being.
Do you know that?

15:26.112 --> 15:28.979
- Having trouble making ends meet?
- Things are tight.

15:29.182 --> 15:31.878
Why don't you apply
to a Locum Tenens program?

15:32.085 --> 15:33.143
A Locum what?

15:33.353 --> 15:36.652
Tenens. Filling in for vacationing
surgeons in rural hospitals...

15:36.856 --> 15:39.324
...in Minnesota, the Dakotas,
on your vacation.

15:39.525 --> 15:44.155
They don't have staff to cover when
somebody's out. They pay a bundle.

15:44.364 --> 15:45.661
What's a "bundle"?

15:45.865 --> 15:48.356
Eight, ten grand for a couple weeks.

15:49.235 --> 15:50.327
Where's the big storm?

15:50.536 --> 15:54.199
Should be any minute now. They're
closing all those schools at lunch...

15:54.407 --> 15:56.136
...recommending people leave early.

15:56.342 --> 16:01.075
They emphasized the importance of
leaving early to get home safely.

16:01.281 --> 16:02.339
No, Jerry.

16:02.548 --> 16:04.778
- The National Weather Service...
- I said, no.

16:04.984 --> 16:08.215
Anspaugh said it might be months
before we get a new Chief.

16:08.421 --> 16:13.154
Months with Romano? Did we do some-
thing in a past life to deserve this?

16:13.359 --> 16:16.886
There's Viking in my family.
Maybe I pillaged Northern Europe.

16:17.096 --> 16:21.032
- Pillaged? Cool.
- Bet you looked great in a horn hat.

16:21.234 --> 16:23.794
Maybe you should consider re-applying.

16:24.003 --> 16:25.971
Once foolish, twice stupid.

16:26.172 --> 16:29.630
Don might entertain renewed interest.
I spoke to him about you.

16:29.842 --> 16:32.936
I don't know if I could
go through all that again.

16:33.146 --> 16:36.547
- Can I tell him you seemed interested?
- How about "intrigued"?

16:36.749 --> 16:38.979
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Mr. Abbott.

16:39.185 --> 16:40.209
- Who?
- Richard Abbott.

16:40.420 --> 16:42.547
His son Ricky died
here this morning.

16:43.156 --> 16:47.024
I'm Dr. Greene. I was with him
earlier, but I haven't seen him.

16:47.226 --> 16:50.662
I work with Richard down
at the state attorney's office.

16:50.863 --> 16:55.129
He's asked us to open an investigation
about his son's death.

16:55.335 --> 16:57.030
Have the police arrived yet?

17:06.244 --> 17:07.108
Hi.

17:07.313 --> 17:08.678
How are you?

17:09.848 --> 17:11.077
I'm fine.

17:13.152 --> 17:15.086
I'm sorry Richard hit you.

17:15.288 --> 17:18.815
We've been separated
since Michael died.

17:19.025 --> 17:21.721
I called him yesterday
to tell him Ricky...

17:24.196 --> 17:28.156
That he should probably try
to come see him.

17:28.735 --> 17:33.195
He was at a conference in Houston,
so I left a message.

17:33.406 --> 17:35.465
And when he arrived this morning...

17:36.576 --> 17:38.703
...and saw that Ricky was gone...

17:38.911 --> 17:42.142
...he kind of lost it.
He just wasn't ready.

17:47.387 --> 17:50.185
It's time for you to let the nurses
finish up with Ricky.

17:58.464 --> 18:00.455
Have you made arrangements for him?

18:05.071 --> 18:08.734
I think I'll go to the same funeral
home that took care of Michael.

18:08.941 --> 18:10.272
I'll call them.

18:11.277 --> 18:13.040
Give me the number, I'll call them.

18:13.613 --> 18:14.978
Thanks.

18:18.217 --> 18:19.411
Got a moment?

18:25.925 --> 18:27.324
What's up, Mark?

18:27.560 --> 18:28.891
The police are here.

18:30.163 --> 18:33.360
Mr. Abbott is accusing you
of murdering his son.

18:36.736 --> 18:38.431
She was hit in the face kickboxing.

18:38.638 --> 18:41.368
Not kickboxing. Tae-Bo class.

18:41.574 --> 18:43.166
It's aerobics, but better.

18:43.376 --> 18:45.708
It's supposed to be good
for losing weight.

18:45.912 --> 18:48.540
- I lost 16 pounds.
- Sixteen pounds? Wow!

18:48.748 --> 18:51.683
I had everybody spread out enough,
but a new guy shows up...

18:51.884 --> 18:52.782
...and she got kicked.

18:52.985 --> 18:54.543
Did you lose consciousness?

18:54.754 --> 18:56.346
No, but I was pretty dizzy.

18:56.556 --> 18:59.457
- How long did it take to lose?
- Just melted off.

18:59.659 --> 19:02.321
I hope this won't keep me
from getting back to class.

19:02.528 --> 19:05.554
Fundus is sharp, no papilledema.

19:05.765 --> 19:07.960
- Want to palpate the orbit?
- No.

19:08.167 --> 19:10.601
- Is it expensive?
- Not bad. It's worth it.

19:10.803 --> 19:12.134
You feel this?

19:13.406 --> 19:15.169
- Any numbness?
- No.

19:15.374 --> 19:18.707
- Do you have early classes?
- Any visual changes?

19:18.911 --> 19:21.038
Shapes? Things out of focus?

19:21.247 --> 19:24.239
I teach a 5:30 class.
If you buy 20, you get five free.

19:24.450 --> 19:26.315
- No kidding?
- Where's a phone?

19:26.519 --> 19:27.508
There's a pay phone.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.587
No step-off. I'm concerned
about your blurred vision.

19:30.790 --> 19:33.486
Let's get some facial films
and a visual acuity.

19:33.693 --> 19:38.062
If you think you can tear yourself
away for five minutes, stitch her up.

19:38.264 --> 19:41.529
- Your wish is my command.
- Irrigate and suture.

19:42.034 --> 19:47.062
I don't usually get a lunch break.
I eat out of the vending machines.

19:47.273 --> 19:50.265
First, lidocaine to numb the area.

19:50.476 --> 19:55.140
Then you'll feel a little bit
of wetness as I irrigate the wound.

19:57.316 --> 20:00.046
- Dr. Carter?
- Yeah?

20:01.120 --> 20:05.284
The cut's pretty deep. Should I
do a few subcutaneous first?

20:05.491 --> 20:07.118
Yeah, absolutely.

20:11.998 --> 20:14.466
I'll check back with you in a bit.

20:16.569 --> 20:18.537
Was he staring at my ass?

20:24.944 --> 20:27.913
The coroner's coming over to get
the body and do an autopsy.

20:28.114 --> 20:30.082
Roger Julian's coming from Genetics.

20:30.283 --> 20:32.444
Says Ricky was on his service.

20:32.652 --> 20:35.120
Wants to know where
the mother got Dilaudid.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.185
He was dying.

20:36.389 --> 20:39.358
You promised IKerry and I that you
wouldn't prescribe...

20:39.559 --> 20:41.857
- He was in pain.
- You promised yesterday!

20:42.061 --> 20:45.360
- The mother was begging me.
- Where did you get the machine?

20:45.565 --> 20:48.398
- I got it from Carol's clinic.
- Come here.

20:52.104 --> 20:53.435
Carol's clinic doesn't have PCAs.

20:53.639 --> 20:56.699
She called in a favor,
got it from one of her suppliers.

20:56.909 --> 20:59.605
The police are on their way
to Joi Abbott's house.

20:59.812 --> 21:01.973
They have a warrant
to impound the PCA.

21:02.181 --> 21:04.342
Are they gonna find anything strange?

21:04.550 --> 21:07.713
- Like what?
- Like the machine set with enough...

21:07.920 --> 21:09.478
...to kill 10 grown men?

21:10.223 --> 21:12.316
- I don't know.
- What? You set it!

21:12.525 --> 21:15.688
This boy was suffering.
He had end-stage ALD, in agony.

21:15.895 --> 21:17.726
The mother was watching him die.

21:17.930 --> 21:19.295
Did you help him along?

21:19.498 --> 21:22.729
I gave the mother the entry code and
showed her how to change the dosage.

21:22.935 --> 21:26.462
I don't know what she did afterwards.
You would've done the same.

21:26.672 --> 21:29.004
Anspaugh's coming
with Romano and Julian.

21:29.208 --> 21:32.405
Doug got the PCA and the Dilaudid
through Carol's clinic.

21:32.612 --> 21:33.909
What? When?

21:34.113 --> 21:36.547
Right after he told us he wouldn't.

21:36.816 --> 21:41.253
We'll have to tell Anspaugh about Doug
violating the pain study protocol...

21:41.454 --> 21:42.580
...and our covering it up.

21:42.788 --> 21:45.586
They're gonna scrutinize
everything he's prescribed.

21:45.791 --> 21:48.157
They'll interview the mother.
It'll come out.

21:48.361 --> 21:49.726
What's wrong with you?!

21:49.929 --> 21:54.628
We trusted you, and you immediately
choose to betray that trust.

21:54.834 --> 21:56.233
I'm done defending you.

21:56.435 --> 21:59.529
- You've been trying to nail me.
- I don't "nail" colleagues.

21:59.739 --> 22:04.301
If you want to destroy your own career,
that's fine. Stay away from mine.

22:08.781 --> 22:10.408
Have you called an attorney?

22:10.816 --> 22:12.545
I don't need an attorney.

22:13.552 --> 22:15.577
It was the right thing to do, Mark.

22:16.722 --> 22:18.849
He had a degenerative
genetic disorder.

22:19.058 --> 22:21.891
His brother died of the same disease
several years ago.

22:22.094 --> 22:26.622
I have a child. I don't know what
I'd do under similar circumstances.

22:26.832 --> 22:30.165
Look, I know Mr. Abbott is upset,
but his son died.

22:30.369 --> 22:34.362
There's nothing Dr. Ross or any other
physician could do about it.

22:34.874 --> 22:37.536
This PCA machine:

22:37.743 --> 22:41.110
It delivers pain medication
to the patient?

22:41.314 --> 22:43.782
A steady dose through an IV.

22:43.983 --> 22:46.850
Can the patient or their
parent program the machine...

22:47.053 --> 22:49.317
...to increase the dosage
if the patient is in pain?

22:49.522 --> 22:52.616
No. They can give
a booster every hour.

22:52.825 --> 22:56.727
But they need a code to change the
dosage. That way they can't mess up.

22:56.929 --> 22:58.590
That's what I thought.

22:58.798 --> 23:03.599
I was surprised when Mrs. Abbott said
Dr. Ross had given her the code...

23:03.803 --> 23:07.102
...and showed her how to change
the dosage before he left.

23:07.807 --> 23:09.502
Why do you think he would do that?

23:10.142 --> 23:14.875
You covered up a serious breach
of a federally-funded program?

23:15.081 --> 23:19.950
It was in the hospital's best interest
to keep it from becoming public.

23:20.152 --> 23:24.486
It'll go public now, in connection
with a high-profile euthanasia case.

23:24.690 --> 23:26.749
- Where did Ross get a PCA?
- The clinic.

23:26.959 --> 23:30.019
- God, what a fiasco!
- What about Ross?

23:30.229 --> 23:31.958
Take him out back and shoot him.

23:33.532 --> 23:37.434
We'll convene a meeting of the
disciplinary committee and investigate.

23:37.636 --> 23:41.572
Okay, but don't conclude it until
we know if the father's going to sue.

23:41.774 --> 23:42.866
Ross keeps working?

23:43.075 --> 23:46.408
You can have him dispense aspirin
if you want to, I don't care.

23:46.612 --> 23:50.173
- Don't take any further action.
- What about Hathaway's clinic?

23:50.383 --> 23:51.714
Close it.

23:52.651 --> 23:55.449
Public Relations will handle
all the press inquiries.

23:55.654 --> 23:59.181
Dr. Romano and I will make sure the
staff cooperates with the police.

24:00.793 --> 24:02.055
That's it.

24:03.596 --> 24:05.257
IKerry, Mark...

24:10.669 --> 24:12.068
I don't know what to say.

24:14.073 --> 24:18.032
When the dust settles, I'll personally
chair an investigation into this...

24:18.244 --> 24:21.372
...and the appropriate
disciplinary action will be taken.

24:22.281 --> 24:24.340
And on a more personal note...

24:26.419 --> 24:29.616
...I don't think I've ever been
more disappointed.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.127
IKerry, I'm sorry this...

25:05.324 --> 25:08.452
I just beat it in.
The roads are getting really slick.

25:08.661 --> 25:11.391
It took me forever
to navigate the IKennedy.

25:11.597 --> 25:15.226
Traffic was backed up for miles.
What's the matter? Somebody die?

25:15.434 --> 25:16.401
Somebody we know?

25:16.602 --> 25:18.229
Dr. Ross lost the ALD kid.

25:18.437 --> 25:19.631
The police are in Trauma Two.

25:19.839 --> 25:23.002
The boy's father accused Doug
of giving him an overdose.

25:23.209 --> 25:24.972
- Oh, my God!
- Coroner took the body.

25:25.177 --> 25:26.906
- Police are interviewing.
- Where's Doug?

25:27.112 --> 25:28.409
In the Pedes Room, I think.

25:28.614 --> 25:31.549
Have you seen the labs on that
drunk with the head lac?

25:31.750 --> 25:33.911
No, but he threw up on me again.

25:34.119 --> 25:35.381
Third scrub top today.

25:35.588 --> 25:39.581
We should wire a bucket to his head
like a feed bag for horses.

25:39.792 --> 25:41.555
Any word on Doug Ross?

25:41.760 --> 25:43.455
Police are interviewing Dr. Greene.

25:43.662 --> 25:46.028
Have you seen Lucy?
Dr. Edson keeps calling.

25:46.232 --> 25:49.633
Last time I saw her she was...
Hey, where's my kickboxer?

25:49.835 --> 25:53.032
Dr. Weaver moved her into Exam Two
when that MI came in.

25:53.239 --> 25:54.968
Lucy was still working on her.

25:55.174 --> 25:56.163
Suturing?

25:56.375 --> 25:59.105
- That should've taken two minutes.
- I haven't seen her.

25:59.311 --> 26:00.801
My heart's really pumping.

26:01.013 --> 26:03.038
- You're getting it.
- Five, six...

26:03.249 --> 26:04.443
...seven, eight, and...

26:13.959 --> 26:15.984
Dr. Carter, are you okay?

26:16.195 --> 26:18.925
Don't move. Chuny, a backboard
and a hard collar.

26:20.332 --> 26:21.560
I don't see any other blood.

26:21.767 --> 26:23.234
Nice kick. Damn!

26:23.435 --> 26:25.562
- What happened?
- I kicked him in the chest.

26:25.771 --> 26:29.104
I was practicing my Tae-Bo.
Now we're gonna roll him.

26:29.308 --> 26:30.400
Back under there.

26:32.177 --> 26:34.543
- Watch your stethoscope, man.
- Pull back.

26:34.747 --> 26:36.977
On my count. One, two, three.

26:38.150 --> 26:40.778
- So it's good, huh?
- Terrific. I'm definitely going.

26:40.986 --> 26:42.112
Maybe I'll come with you.

26:54.934 --> 26:56.925
Hey, Doug, I just heard.

26:57.136 --> 26:58.603
- You okay?
- Yeah.

26:59.371 --> 27:02.397
Didn't anyone explain Ricky's
medical condition to them?

27:02.608 --> 27:04.075
And they're still pursuing it?

27:04.276 --> 27:05.800
Apparently so.

27:06.412 --> 27:08.209
I don't believe this.

27:10.316 --> 27:13.285
Can I do anything for you?
Do you need anything?

27:14.386 --> 27:17.082
You know, you're the first person
to ask me that all day.

27:17.756 --> 27:19.485
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

27:19.692 --> 27:24.129
I'm supposed to work a fast track,
but I can get someone to cover.

27:24.330 --> 27:28.266
I don't have much to do. Weaver
pulled me away from seeing patients.

27:28.467 --> 27:30.901
Told me to sit here
and catch up on paperwork.

27:31.103 --> 27:32.536
For how long?

27:32.738 --> 27:35.730
From the tone of her voice,
I'd guess maybe forever.

27:37.376 --> 27:38.866
What did Mark say?

27:39.078 --> 27:41.046
They're closing ranks,
covering their asses.

27:41.246 --> 27:43.680
Dr. Ross?
You have a couple minutes?

27:43.882 --> 27:45.907
I'm gonna grab some coffee. You set?

27:46.118 --> 27:49.417
I'm down the hall in 117.
Meet you there in five?

27:49.622 --> 27:50.714
Okay.

28:04.403 --> 28:05.529
Dr. Greene?

28:05.871 --> 28:08.362
I'm sorry. Is this not a good time?

28:08.574 --> 28:10.599
No, it's fine. Come on in.

28:10.809 --> 28:13.107
Do you remember my wife, IKubby?

28:13.312 --> 28:15.007
Sure. Hi.

28:15.347 --> 28:17.508
Did you two talk about this?

28:17.716 --> 28:19.377
His back? It is worse?

28:19.585 --> 28:24.249
His back is better. I suggested he
see a urologist for his other problem.

28:25.924 --> 28:28.392
It's possible that he may
need surgery.

28:28.594 --> 28:29.526
Surgery?

28:31.563 --> 28:36.500
If this is uncomfortable for you,
I can leave for a few minutes...

28:36.702 --> 28:39.535
No, please. Stay.

29:05.364 --> 29:06.991
- How you doing?
- Hey.

29:07.199 --> 29:08.689
Have a seat, doctor.

29:08.901 --> 29:11.870
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
I got an extra one.

29:12.071 --> 29:14.539
I'll have to drink it myself.

29:14.740 --> 29:16.037
Who's that?

29:16.241 --> 29:19.404
Detective Brannigan.
He's part of the felony review team.

29:19.611 --> 29:23.012
We investigate all
the first-degree murder cases.

29:25.951 --> 29:28.852
I'm not trying to hang you out to dry
or ruin your career.

29:29.955 --> 29:34.255
But if you showed Mrs. Abbott how
to alter the PCA to deliver...

29:34.460 --> 29:38.988
...a fatal dose of Dilaudid, you can
be held accountable for Ricky's death.

29:42.701 --> 29:45.499
Now, Miss Hathaway said
that Ricky was getting...

29:45.704 --> 29:48.502
...eighty mics of Dilaudid
an hour through the PCA.

29:48.707 --> 29:50.698
"Mics" is micrograms?

29:51.376 --> 29:54.868
And that Ricky's mother
could give him a booster...

29:55.080 --> 29:57.640
...of an additional 120
every two hours.

29:57.850 --> 29:59.078
That's right.

29:59.284 --> 30:04.483
She was uncertain as to how much
Dilaudid you'd placed in the machine.

30:04.690 --> 30:08.626
It was empty when Detective Brannigan
examined it a few minutes ago.

30:08.894 --> 30:09.883
Mr. Sullivan...

30:19.171 --> 30:23.631
I've dedicated my life
to pediatric medicine.

30:24.877 --> 30:27.402
I've cared for dozens of dying kids.

30:27.613 --> 30:32.073
IKids in agony, pain you and I
can't even imagine.

30:37.156 --> 30:39.317
Ricky Abbott was gonna die.

30:40.459 --> 30:41.926
Not in a month...

30:42.561 --> 30:45.462
...or a week, or a day. In hours.

30:45.664 --> 30:51.000
And nothing I did or could have done
was gonna change that.

30:55.007 --> 30:58.101
His mother had already watched
one son die from the disease.

30:58.310 --> 31:03.304
She was sitting there watching her
second son dying a horrible death...

31:03.515 --> 31:06.211
...from something that
she passed on to him.

31:15.494 --> 31:18.520
Sometimes it's impossible
to save a kid's life.

31:18.730 --> 31:20.925
And the only thing we can do...

31:22.167 --> 31:24.397
...is save them from suffering...

31:25.671 --> 31:27.798
...leave them with a little dignity.

31:29.842 --> 31:32.003
In the end, that's all they have.

31:37.282 --> 31:41.582
Tell me, were you relieving
the child's suffering...

31:41.787 --> 31:44.654
...or were you relieving your own?

31:46.725 --> 31:49.319
If you were so certain
you were doing the right thing...

31:49.528 --> 31:53.055
...why didn't you administer
the lethal dose yourself?

31:53.632 --> 31:55.156
You're the doctor.

31:56.168 --> 31:59.729
You could've stayed and made
sure there were no complications.

32:00.072 --> 32:02.370
That he really did die with dignity.

32:03.141 --> 32:04.472
But you left.

32:06.211 --> 32:08.873
You knew that killing
that child was wrong.

32:09.081 --> 32:12.073
That's why you snuck out
of the house before dawn.

32:12.517 --> 32:14.508
You didn't want to be there, did you?

32:16.388 --> 32:18.686
You didn't want to be there...

32:18.891 --> 32:22.827
...because you knew
killing Ricky Abbott was wrong.

32:27.833 --> 32:29.926
I don't see a broken rib.

32:30.602 --> 32:32.866
Maybe a hairline fracture.

32:33.672 --> 32:38.006
- It's like an elephant sat on my chest.
- Don't get up.

32:39.778 --> 32:41.678
How did you get that cut?

32:41.880 --> 32:43.905
I think I hit it with the chart.

32:44.483 --> 32:46.348
You've taken martial arts before.

32:46.551 --> 32:48.917
IKarate when I was, like, 7.

32:50.656 --> 32:55.116
It can't hurt that bad. It's tiny.
It doesn't even need a stitch.

32:56.161 --> 32:57.128
Baby.

33:00.766 --> 33:01.824
There.

33:03.001 --> 33:03.990
Better?

33:04.770 --> 33:06.032
Much.

33:15.580 --> 33:17.571
I'm a doctor, you're a student.

33:22.154 --> 33:24.054
So we shouldn't be doing this.

33:39.805 --> 33:41.773
The storm's finally here.

33:41.974 --> 33:43.999
Romano closed my clinic.

33:47.312 --> 33:48.370
Why?

33:48.714 --> 33:51.046
Because I helped you get the PCA.

33:51.650 --> 33:53.550
Well, Ricky was dying.

33:54.319 --> 33:56.685
I was there. I know he was dying.

33:58.357 --> 34:00.917
I didn't know you were
gonna help his mother...

34:01.626 --> 34:05.824
...use a piece of my equipment to
administer a lethal dose of Dilaudid.

34:06.865 --> 34:08.889
I didn't want to get you involved.

34:09.101 --> 34:10.568
But Doug, I was involved.

34:13.472 --> 34:17.465
I mean, were you planning on
telling me any of this, ever?

34:21.746 --> 34:22.735
I don't know.

34:23.715 --> 34:25.205
I hadn't decided.

34:26.018 --> 34:29.920
What about you promising Mark
never to prescribe narcotics?

34:30.121 --> 34:32.920
Had you decided on sharing
that information with me?

34:35.092 --> 34:36.560
I thought it was right.

34:36.762 --> 34:38.627
Damn the consequences, right?

34:38.830 --> 34:41.856
I was willing to live
with the consequences.

34:43.835 --> 34:46.827
Mark and IKerry
are facing disciplinary action.

34:47.572 --> 34:49.062
My clinic has been closed...

34:49.274 --> 34:52.971
...which means hundreds of patients
have no place else to go.

34:53.445 --> 34:55.003
The police...

34:55.714 --> 34:58.911
...are questioning
the entire ER staff.

35:00.118 --> 35:02.848
Your actions carry consequences, Doug.

35:03.622 --> 35:05.419
It's not just about you.

35:10.629 --> 35:12.221
Do you even give a damn?

35:17.235 --> 35:18.793
Don't do that. Don't walk away.

35:19.838 --> 35:20.964
Why not?

35:21.173 --> 35:23.164
You don't need anybody else.

35:23.375 --> 35:26.344
You are a country unto yourself.

35:26.545 --> 35:28.672
You make decisions,
ruin peoples' lives.

35:28.880 --> 35:32.281
- Narcissism, elevated to a high art.
- Carol, Carol...

35:32.484 --> 35:33.781
What?

35:37.122 --> 35:38.487
I'm sorry.

35:42.894 --> 35:44.759
That's what you always say, Doug.

36:15.961 --> 36:20.921
<i>Some of the roadways are impassable,</i>
<i>as you can see from this video.</i>

36:21.133 --> 36:24.193
<i>Both of the airports, Midway</i>
<i>and O'Hare, are closed...</i>

36:24.402 --> 36:25.391
I'll never get home.

36:25.604 --> 36:26.832
Somebody beep me?

36:27.038 --> 36:29.370
- I did. Where have you been?
- Upstairs with Legal.

36:29.574 --> 36:31.132
We are stacked up.

36:31.343 --> 36:35.211
When Romano closed Carol's clinic,
all her cases got dumped onto us.

36:35.413 --> 36:36.846
Most of them are in Chairs.

36:37.048 --> 36:39.846
Jerry, stop watching TV
and get your tail over here.

36:40.051 --> 36:41.916
How long are the police
keeping Trauma Two?

36:42.120 --> 36:43.144
I don't know.

36:43.355 --> 36:45.880
Why does Carter have so many
old cases up?

36:46.091 --> 36:48.787
He got kicked in the chest.
Lucy's working on him.

36:48.994 --> 36:51.690
Could this day get any worse?

36:51.897 --> 36:55.458
Conni, go tell the clinic patients
we won't get to them today.

36:55.667 --> 36:56.861
They might as well go home.

36:57.068 --> 36:59.536
Chuny, go see how Carter's doing.

36:59.738 --> 37:02.639
If he can't work,
we'll call in the Jeopardy Resident.

37:02.841 --> 37:04.638
- You got it.
- Damn it, Jerry!

37:04.843 --> 37:07.403
Stop watching that TV
or I'll come over there...

37:07.612 --> 37:10.706
...rip it off the wall with my hands
and beat you to death!

37:16.021 --> 37:17.511
- Wait. Wait.
- I almost got it.

37:17.722 --> 37:19.451
No, I mean, really. Wait.

37:20.692 --> 37:22.455
Yeah, this isn't right.

37:23.428 --> 37:25.521
- We can't be doing this.
- Why not?

37:25.730 --> 37:27.721
Well, because there are rules.

37:27.933 --> 37:29.400
You think we'd get in trouble?

37:29.634 --> 37:31.761
Not we. Me.

37:32.571 --> 37:34.129
Dr. Carter, you in there?

37:34.339 --> 37:36.330
You locked that door, right?

37:36.541 --> 37:38.202
Yeah. Absolutely.

37:38.410 --> 37:39.809
Both of them?

37:43.915 --> 37:45.314
Dr. Carter, you okay?

37:45.517 --> 37:47.610
- Just a second.
- What are you doing?

37:47.819 --> 37:50.845
You just locked the door.
She knows somebody's in here.

37:53.825 --> 37:55.087
How are you feeling?

37:55.293 --> 37:57.227
Much better. Thank you.

37:59.464 --> 38:01.557
- He didn't need any stitches.
- Good.

38:01.766 --> 38:03.700
- I'm going back to work.
- You're inside out.

38:04.803 --> 38:07.203
Your sweater.
You've got it on inside out.

38:12.544 --> 38:14.512
When did it stop snowing?

38:16.147 --> 38:17.705
A few minutes ago.

38:22.354 --> 38:25.221
We don't look much like
dangerous felons.

38:25.457 --> 38:27.288
Speak for yourself.

38:28.426 --> 38:30.553
I'm so sorry about all this.

38:32.497 --> 38:33.794
You okay?

38:35.200 --> 38:36.292
Are you?

38:38.136 --> 38:39.763
I've had better days.

38:41.206 --> 38:42.537
Yeah.

38:43.942 --> 38:45.136
You know, when...

38:47.279 --> 38:49.509
When Michael died...

38:49.714 --> 38:52.182
...I cried for days.

38:52.851 --> 38:56.378
I felt that I'd died too.

39:00.225 --> 39:04.025
That I'd never feel love or joy again.

39:09.734 --> 39:11.702
Then Ricky came and read to me.

39:13.705 --> 39:16.196
He'd sit on the end of the bed...

39:16.675 --> 39:19.473
...and tell me these stupid jokes...

39:19.678 --> 39:21.942
...that he'd heard in second grade...

39:22.247 --> 39:23.509
...and he'd smile.

39:24.983 --> 39:26.177
God...

39:27.218 --> 39:30.381
I wish you'd seen him like that.

39:47.939 --> 39:49.497
You still have your daughter.

39:53.678 --> 39:55.805
I guess I should go back inside...

39:56.314 --> 39:59.545
...and see if my ex-husband's ready
to let me talk to her.

40:07.192 --> 40:09.752
Thank you, Dr. Ross...

40:14.099 --> 40:15.930
...for everything.

40:24.442 --> 40:27.878
The 92-year-old dislocated ankle
in Exam One has been reduced.

40:28.079 --> 40:30.946
Give her a Vicodin and tell her
to stay off her skates.

40:31.149 --> 40:33.447
Ninety-two years old
and she still skates?

40:33.651 --> 40:35.676
- You have something on your neck.
- Where?

40:35.887 --> 40:37.787
- There.
- It looks like somebody bit you.

40:37.989 --> 40:40.856
I think I might've hit something
when I fell down.

40:43.228 --> 40:45.788
- You bit me.
- What? No, I didn't.

40:46.564 --> 40:48.691
Guess I must've gotten carried away.

40:51.636 --> 40:53.604
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

40:53.805 --> 40:56.103
Roxanne called, twice.

40:56.608 --> 40:58.041
- So...
- So?

40:58.243 --> 41:00.711
- So what, Jerry?
- So, Lucy...

41:00.912 --> 41:02.470
Come on. Everybody knows.

41:02.680 --> 41:05.547
- I heard it from the cashier.
- Sheri from Radiology.

41:05.750 --> 41:08.719
- I'm not having this conversation.
- Answer the MICN.

41:08.920 --> 41:10.148
Nothing happened.

41:10.355 --> 41:12.721
- I gotta talk to you.
- I got patients.

41:12.924 --> 41:14.915
Listen, I'm gonna go to Anspaugh.

41:15.126 --> 41:19.062
I'll tell him I coerced you and IKerry
to go along on the drug protocol.

41:19.264 --> 41:23.826
- Coerced? How?
- I'll say I promised I'd do it myself.

41:24.035 --> 41:26.230
And that's why you didn't report it.

41:26.438 --> 41:30.772
I think there's been enough lying.
Why don't we just stick to the truth?

41:30.975 --> 41:33.068
- I'm trying to help.
- I don't want help.

41:33.278 --> 41:37.112
I made decisions of my own free will.
I'll stand behind them.

41:37.315 --> 41:38.407
You don't believe me.

41:38.616 --> 41:40.106
I don't know what to believe.

41:40.318 --> 41:43.515
You lie, undermine my authority
every chance you get...

41:43.721 --> 41:46.189
...bend the rules to fit your needs.

41:46.391 --> 41:48.154
"I'll just lie my way out of it."

41:48.359 --> 41:50.759
I'm just trying to do you a favor.

41:50.962 --> 41:54.728
Don't. I'll be lucky if I survive
the ones you've already done.

41:54.933 --> 41:59.427
We got a school bus flipped over.
Firemen need a doctor on the scene.

41:59.637 --> 42:01.104
- Where?
- Downtown somewhere.

42:01.306 --> 42:05.538
Some kids may die before we can get
them out. Weaver wants you to go.

42:05.743 --> 42:07.438
Unit 62's waiting for you.

42:07.645 --> 42:09.579
- How many?
- Fifteen, nine are still trapped.

42:09.781 --> 42:12.181
A snowplow blade went into the bus.

42:12.383 --> 42:14.214
- Where are you going?
- You need me.

42:14.419 --> 42:16.512
- You are off the service.
- I'm coming.

42:16.721 --> 42:18.188
The hell you are!

42:18.389 --> 42:20.721
- Ready to go, doc?
- Yeah, let's do it!

42:21.526 --> 42:23.994
- Get back inside.
- You got kids dying.

42:24.195 --> 42:27.130
Maybe you'll think about
that next time.

42:34.906 --> 42:37.204
- Where are you going?
- I'm driving myself.

42:37.408 --> 42:39.603
- I'm coming.
- You don't have a coat.

42:39.811 --> 42:42.177
I'll get one. Just wait.
Wait for me!

42:58.363 --> 43:01.059
We got the jaws
working the forward section.

43:01.266 --> 43:03.791
We got three kids trapped
under the blade.

43:04.002 --> 43:06.800
I was afraid they'd bleed out
before we could get them out.

43:07.005 --> 43:09.166
I got a crane coming
to lift the plow.

43:09.374 --> 43:12.309
Driver tried to stop
but it's pure ice. Plow hit him.

43:12.510 --> 43:15.968
We'll go in through the side window
and climb down to reach them.

43:16.447 --> 43:19.041
Doc, it's pretty bad in there.

43:19.517 --> 43:20.779
Watch your step.

43:21.452 --> 43:22.476
- Skipper?
- Yeah?

43:22.687 --> 43:25.315
We're gonna need O-neg.
Lots of it, okay?

43:25.523 --> 43:27.252
And get some propane heaters...

43:27.458 --> 43:29.892
...before these kids freeze to death.

43:30.094 --> 43:32.528
Hey, turn this up. I love this song.

43:33.598 --> 43:35.156
Earth, Wind and Fire?

43:35.366 --> 43:37.061
My dad used to love them.

43:38.536 --> 43:41.528
Dating me. Junior high.

43:49.180 --> 43:51.375
So you never asked me if I did it.

43:53.017 --> 43:54.041
I hope you did.

43:54.252 --> 43:56.720
I wouldn't want to suffer
the way he did.

43:57.589 --> 43:59.386
I've thought about that a lot.

44:03.861 --> 44:06.659
You know, Jeanie, you never talk
about your HIV.

44:20.011 --> 44:21.000
Hold on!
