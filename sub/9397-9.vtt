00:18.200 --> 00:19.792
Better make room.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.956
Your other mom should be dead soon.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.319
Hi. Can I help you?

00:33.720 --> 00:35.472
That's one of our shirts.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.513
Young lady, you're under arrest
for the possession of stolen property.

00:38.600 --> 00:39.589
- What?
- Yes.

00:39.680 --> 00:42.433
No, no, no! I just needed
something to sleep in. Brooke...

00:42.520 --> 00:43.953
Brooke!

00:45.720 --> 00:47.392
This is so <i>Brokedown Palace.</i>

00:47.480 --> 00:50.790
I can't believe I got arrested
for wearing a stupid tank top.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.438
Well, I told you
you should've done your laundry.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.751
I got arrested for wearing one
of your stupid tank tops that you stole.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.159
Well, sheesh!

00:57.240 --> 00:59.117
I guess we know
who the cellblock tough's gonna be.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.315
Brooke, this isn't funny!

01:00.400 --> 01:02.391
This is going on my permanent record,
on my college transcript,

01:02.480 --> 01:03.879
and I am this close
to beating your ass right now.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.518
Okay, all right. Calm down.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.195
Sorry.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.714
Look, I talked to them.
I told them that the store ripped off

01:09.800 --> 01:10.789
Brooke's designs.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.189
So all we have to do is pay them back
for the clothes, and we can go.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.713
So what do you wanna do?

01:14.800 --> 01:16.916
Well, we should call somebody,
like our parents.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.319
Mine are in California.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.118
Mine are in an RV somewhere.

01:20.320 --> 01:24.393
Mine's out to sea or dead or vanished.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.268
<i>- Operator.</i>
- Hi. Collect call, please.

01:28.360 --> 01:31.033
<i>- Party's name?</i>
- Nathan Scott.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.998
What do you mean you need money?

01:34.880 --> 01:36.632
You know what?
You're gonna rot in jail then,

01:36.720 --> 01:38.517
'cause you're not getting
another dime out of me.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.750
Aren't you supposed to be
in the studio right now?

01:40.840 --> 01:41.989
<i>I am.</i>

01:42.240 --> 01:44.435
<i>I just figured it'd be better</i>
<i>if I told you on the phone.</i>

01:44.600 --> 01:46.397
<i>Now, just relax. I'm coming in.</i>

01:51.560 --> 01:52.959
Okay, here's the deal.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.509
You gave me the money. I had the money.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.113
Then I lost the money playing poker.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.552
Forget jail. Call the morgue.
I gave you $2,000.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.551
I can get it back.
I talked to the guy I lost it to.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.551
I just need a ride.
It's about 80 miles from here.

02:07.640 --> 02:08.675
- No way.
- Okay.

02:08.759 --> 02:10.716
I figured you'd say that, too.
And I guess it's cool.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.435
It's just that without the money,
the studio won't release Haley's masters.

02:14.520 --> 02:15.794
That's the not-so-cool part.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.269
But, listen, you give me a ride,
I'll get the money back.

02:18.360 --> 02:19.793
I promise.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.349
80 miles, you don't speak.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.791
- Let's go.
- Sweet!

02:29.000 --> 02:31.878
Road trip, Nate! Right? Road trip.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.275
Okay, thank you.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.670
Oh, and Brooke keeps some extra cash
under her bed in a drawer. Okay.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.876
Hurry, please! Thank you.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.236
Great. So Nathan's coming.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.748
Yeah, I couldn't get a hold of Nathan.
I had to call Lucas.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.991
Haley, if he goes in that drawer,

02:49.080 --> 02:51.196
he's gonna find all the letters
I wrote him last summer.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.599
Good.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.596
- It could be the best thing for you.
- It could be the worst thing for me.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.079
One or the other.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.475
Well, well, so that's who tried to kill me.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.190
Okay, girls, let's go.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.597
- Not you, Martha Stewart.
- What? Why?

03:36.680 --> 03:40.275
The kid with the cash
only paid for the other two.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.594
Wait!

03:42.600 --> 03:44.079
- You guys all right?
- Yeah.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.310
- Lucas, did you not pay for Brooke?
- I paid for her.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.198
I just had them wait an extra 10 minutes
before they let her go.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.474
So you're just screwing with her?

03:50.560 --> 03:52.118
And you don't think she screwed with me?

03:52.200 --> 03:54.919
Non-exclusive dating,
the costume for the masquerade party,

03:55.000 --> 03:56.911
the "fantasy-boy-draft" misunderstanding.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.592
Look, I've done everything
she's asked me to do

03:58.680 --> 03:59.874
since she got back, and what do I get?

03:59.960 --> 04:01.757
Front row seat to her and Keller
in bed together.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.434
Well... Luke, wait, just stop, okay.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.552
It's not like
you don't have a right to be upset,

04:06.640 --> 04:08.835
but at least wait five minutes
and talk to her,

04:08.920 --> 04:10.114
and then give her a ride home.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.713
Can't do it. Are you guys coming?

04:11.800 --> 04:13.677
I gotta be at the studio right now,
and I can't wait for her.

04:13.760 --> 04:16.149
- It's okay. I'll wait for her.
- Okay, thank you.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.637
Lucas, what am I supposed to tell Brooke?

04:19.920 --> 04:21.591
Tell her to call Chris Keller.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.077
Dude, we seriously need some tunes.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.718
No, don't!

04:28.080 --> 04:29.069
It's jammed.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.436
Oh, come on, man, what's a road trip
without some road tunes?

04:35.760 --> 04:37.671
Listen to me. This is not a road trip.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.990
This is a business trip to fix your screwup.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.116
Now, we get the money,
we get Haley's song,

04:42.200 --> 04:44.031
and if you're lucky,
I don't rearrange your face.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.155
Fine.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.315
Jeez.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.592
- By the way, how's your poker game?
- Why?

04:57.680 --> 05:00.638
Just that's how we're gonna
get the money back, playing poker.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.353
Hey, I fixed it.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.954
All you had to do was keep your word,
and you couldn't do it.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.349
Take the money,
pay the studio and help Haley.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.032
I am trying to help.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.474
It's a $100 buy-in. I got about 500 bucks.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.558
Okay, it's either this,
or you can say goodbye to Haley's demo.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.032
I thought you said you lost all the money.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.348
Oh, I did.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.239
This is the money
your dad paid me last week

05:33.320 --> 05:34.673
to seduce Haley.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.353
Man, my head!

05:38.880 --> 05:40.598
I wasn't gonna do it.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.276
<i>Dan Scott would have you believe</i>
<i>that he's the "family first" candidate</i>

05:44.360 --> 05:46.271
<i>for Tree Hill Mayor.</i>

05:48.120 --> 05:50.554
<i>It's a good thing his son can't vote.</i>

05:51.200 --> 05:54.715
<i>Karen Roe, the smart choice.</i>
<i>The caring choice.</i>

05:55.120 --> 05:56.917
You must be pleased with yourself.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.952
<i>Brought to you</i>
<i>by the people for Karen Roe.</i>

05:59.040 --> 06:01.759
But I guess I should thank you.
I mean, this little commercial of yours,

06:01.840 --> 06:03.751
this could bring me a whole new
batch of viewers.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.877
- Wife beaters, S&M freaks.
- Who're you kidding?

06:07.040 --> 06:08.712
You're in trouble, and you know it.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.317
I wouldn't be so sure.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.433
This afternoon when the polls open
and we give our final speeches,

06:15.520 --> 06:16.794
you're gonna concede.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.990
Really? Or what?

06:19.160 --> 06:21.674
Or I'm gonna show the public
who tried to kill me.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.551
Notice the time and date stamp.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.876
Day of the fire, a few hours before.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.311
And wait for it, this is the good part.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.272
Gentlemen, we have a winner.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.397
I believe that's the same brand of booze
used to poison me,

06:43.320 --> 06:46.073
and I believe that's someone
you care about buying it.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.998
Someone with motive.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.030
The tangled web we weave.

06:55.840 --> 06:59.549
When you concede today,
make sure you say nice things about me.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.433
Oh, please be there, come on.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.393
Oh, thank God.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.435
Hi. How are you?

07:43.280 --> 07:44.872
Right. Okay.

07:47.760 --> 07:51.150
I don't know what to say
other than I'm so sorry.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.316
You have nothing to apologize for.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.478
- We weren't together.
- Luke...

07:55.560 --> 07:57.516
I just didn't know non-exclusive meant

07:57.600 --> 08:00.956
"Hell, I'm gonna sleep with Chris Keller."

08:01.520 --> 08:03.238
Pretty skanky move, Brooke.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.956
I am sorry.

08:07.520 --> 08:11.513
I am sorry that I did it,
and I am sorry that you had to see it.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.875
But you are looking at me right now
like I am so much worse than you,

08:15.960 --> 08:18.633
and you were with Peyton
while we were dating.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.790
I didn't sleep with Peyton.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.556
No, but you slept with Nicki.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.431
I didn't have feelings for you then.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.150
I guess that's my answer.

08:29.960 --> 08:33.554
No, it's not, Lucas.
I care about you so much.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.034
Well, you have a hell of a way
of showing it.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.474
I don't know why I did it, okay? I am...

08:46.640 --> 08:48.278
I mean, yeah, I was drinking,

08:48.360 --> 08:51.318
and I was jealous
that you were with Rachel. But I think

08:52.720 --> 08:56.759
it was really just because I was
really afraid to get close to you again.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.150
Well, you don't have to worry
about that now,

09:01.440 --> 09:02.953
do you?

09:05.960 --> 09:10.431
I didn't expect you to be kind about this,
but seeing you this way,

09:12.200 --> 09:14.873
it's even worse than I thought it would be.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.628
Good.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.673
Haley, there's a call for Chris.
Is he coming in today?

09:40.960 --> 09:42.712
He's supposed to be here right now.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.234
Yeah, can I take a message for Chris?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.912
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to get
in line, 'cause he owes me money, too.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.389
And trust me, I guarantee
it's a lot more than he owes you

09:53.480 --> 09:55.755
for some Batman costume rental.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.192
Great. Riverboat gambling.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.838
Nice move, Tom Sawyer.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.799
Let me guess. You got a gun in there,
and we're gonna rob the place.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.393
Actually, that was Plan B.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.190
Dude, this is a 1967 Gibson double.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.350
I wasn't gonna leave it
in that junker car of yours.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.192
Plus, I look cool carrying a guitar.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.273
Let's go.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.910
The guy I lost the money to, Marty,

10:31.000 --> 10:32.991
well, he kind of scares me.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.670
Poker-playing psycho named Marty.
That's perfect.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.957
Well, well, gang's all here.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.593
Nate, this is Dexter.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.598
This is Emanuelle.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.636
These are the cops. Hey, guys.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.637
And this is Marty.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.595
You're Marty?

10:49.120 --> 10:51.634
Yeah, that's right. Who the hell are you?

10:51.720 --> 10:53.676
Oh, this is Nate. He's a big poker player.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.159
What do you mean big?

10:55.400 --> 10:58.915
- Is that supposed to be some kind of joke?
- No, no. I just mean he...

10:59.520 --> 11:01.511
Hey, can we play or what? Right?

11:01.640 --> 11:02.789
I don't know. Can you?

11:02.880 --> 11:06.668
You got your buy-in, Keller,
or are you a little short?

11:10.480 --> 11:13.153
Chris Keller, the human ATM.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.438
It's your loss.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.831
What are you watching?

11:25.480 --> 11:27.357
I don't know, but they seem sad.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.797
Did you talk to Lucas?

11:32.120 --> 11:33.235
Sorry.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.872
Where did we go so wrong?

11:38.560 --> 11:40.949
Well, I slept with Chris Keller,
and you went on tour with him.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.873
No, I mean... Okay, yeah.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.118
But when did we start
letting boys dictate our happiness?

11:47.320 --> 11:48.992
I was nine.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.355
Well, I don't care. It has to stop.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.432
You've got too much talent
with your fashion line.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.589
Not anymore.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.352
Oh, so what!
So they stole a couple of designs.

11:56.440 --> 11:59.512
They didn't steal your talent.
I'm sure you've got more.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.313
- A couple of unfinished dresses.
- So finish them.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.989
Listen, we'll put together a website,

12:06.080 --> 12:07.991
and we'll sell them ourselves.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.635
- And you'd help me?
- Yeah, I'd help you.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.629
You have to help yourself first,
though, missy.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.393
Clothes over bros?

12:18.960 --> 12:20.552
Clothes over bros.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.035
Okay, this is crap.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.715
- What's that?
- You being here.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.195
It's one thing for you to haunt my dreams,
but I'm awake now.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.793
You sure about that?

12:38.240 --> 12:40.674
- Besides, guilt never sleeps.
- Guilt?

12:42.520 --> 12:45.557
Oh, okay, so that's it.
You're what, my subconscious?

12:45.640 --> 12:48.996
No, no. I'm just like
the little voice inside your head.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.196
Only I'm not so much on the inside now.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.078
Fine. I'm talking to myself. I'll play along.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.355
Hey, what are you doing here?

12:56.520 --> 12:59.830
I'm having a snack.
See, it's pretty great, actually.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.435
I eat, and you get fat!

13:03.400 --> 13:06.119
Oh, hey, I fixed this for you.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.352
"People always grieve"?

13:14.680 --> 13:15.749
You spelt it wrong.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.832
Well, if I spelt it wrong, then so did you.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.070
Who knew my subconscious
could be such a bitch?

13:21.160 --> 13:24.311
No, no, we're a bitch.
Try to keep up, okay?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.312
Oh, hey, check it out.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.278
Closet full of anxiety. Get it?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.036
Look, Ghost of Christmas Goth,

13:33.120 --> 13:35.588
what do I have to do or say
to get rid of you?

13:36.200 --> 13:37.633
That's easy.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.679
Where's your bracelet?

13:39.760 --> 13:40.909
P. Sawyer!

13:41.360 --> 13:44.193
- Oh, sorry, were you sleeping?
- I think so.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.476
I guess I lost Ellie's cancer bracelet.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.359
Nothing. What's up?

13:51.160 --> 13:54.311
I need some artwork
for my new fashion line.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.831
You mean the fashion line
that Suburban Filth owns?

13:56.920 --> 13:59.957
No, I mean my new fashion line.
Haley helped me see the light.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.713
Instead of making out,
I should be making clothes.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.312
Although clothes make you look hot,
and then boys wanna make out with you.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.119
Not the point. I'm moving on,
and I'm doing my own thing.

14:09.680 --> 14:10.874
These are perfect.

14:10.960 --> 14:14.839
So, sleep it up. Come over tonight,
'cause my stuff is gonna rock your socks.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.992
You're bluffing.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.359
Then call me and find out.

14:29.160 --> 14:32.197
I'll do more than that. I'll raise you, Marty.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.509
All in.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.679
- Dude, maybe you shouldn't do that.
- Dude, he's bluffing.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.119
Read them and weep.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.432
It's practically an orgy.

14:47.640 --> 14:51.235
A pair of threes!
You lost everything on a pair of threes?

14:51.640 --> 14:52.834
You suck at this, Chris.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.593
Keller, you look like a toilet at the airport,

14:55.680 --> 14:57.477
broke and full of crap.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.713
How about these?
This car's worth at least two grand.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.994
- Hold on.
- I'll give you 50 bucks for it.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.479
- Done.
- No way in hell!

15:05.560 --> 15:06.754
Dude, let's just get out of here.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.910
You wanna get Haley's tape back or what?

15:09.400 --> 15:13.359
I'll tell you what,
here's 50 bucks and a condom.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.477
You two can get a room.
We're playing poker.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.870
Hi. It's me.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.515
I need to ask you something.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.631
Did you try to kill Dan?

16:09.400 --> 16:13.313
Because I... I need to know the truth.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.470
Been on a hell of a roll, kid.
Nobody's that lucky.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.315
What's the matter, Marty? Short temper?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.753
- No, something's messed up.
- Yeah, your teeth.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.791
No. He's right.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.913
For the last two hours,
every time you deal, he wins.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.798
- No, not every time.
- But for the last two hours!

16:38.040 --> 16:41.112
- What are you saying, Marty?
- What I'm trying to say is this,

16:41.240 --> 16:43.879
if we turn over those cards
and he has a pair of anything,

16:43.960 --> 16:45.359
your ass is as good as dead.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.557
Man, you know what? This is crap.
Nathan, let's go.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.315
All right, hold on, hold on.
I've lost a lot tonight.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.515
Not lately.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.512
- We got a problem here?
- No problem.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.511
Yeah, no problem here.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.676
So long as that card's not a jack.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.915
Okay, look, Marty,
I don't wanna hit you because you're...

17:07.000 --> 17:08.558
You got something to say,
you say it, Keller!

17:08.640 --> 17:09.789
Ah, hell!

17:16.760 --> 17:18.478
- Running!
- Grab them!

17:36.040 --> 17:37.598
Dude, we gotta jump!

17:37.680 --> 17:39.159
No way, man! Chris Keller can't swim.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.832
It's either jump or die!

17:41.680 --> 17:43.989
You're not hearing me. I can't swim!

17:44.080 --> 17:46.196
- Do you have the money?
- Yeah, I got it right here, but...

17:46.280 --> 17:47.679
Okay, good.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.510
- What the hell!
- Go!

18:24.560 --> 18:26.915
All right, not bad.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.676
Are you serious? My cellphone's shot,

18:30.880 --> 18:33.314
we're in the middle of nowhere,
and you check your guitar?

18:33.520 --> 18:35.636
How about a thank you
for not letting you drown?

18:36.080 --> 18:38.116
Chris Keller was dog paddling just fine.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.156
Chris Keller was sinking just fine.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.558
Give me the money.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.599
Oh, I must have lost it all in the river.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.475
I should've let you drown.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.237
Wait up, man. It's spooky out here.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.318
- You okay?
- Oh, just a little nervous.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.551
You know, polls are open
and in a few minutes

19:16.640 --> 19:18.358
I give my final address.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.916
Mom, Dan just told me
he thinks someone tried to kill him.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.868
The fire was ruled an accident.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.958
But what if it wasn't?

19:27.080 --> 19:29.389
You know, and what if he does have proof?

19:29.840 --> 19:32.718
Is winning this election worth the risk?

19:33.360 --> 19:36.989
You know, maybe
you should concede, Mom.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.396
Final statements, Karen.

19:41.240 --> 19:42.798
These came for you.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.274
And you know
I have to stand by Dan tonight.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.588
I just...

19:49.120 --> 19:50.678
Good luck.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.673
They're from Andy.

20:03.920 --> 20:07.469
Whatever you say, be sure not to stumble
on the word "concede."

20:14.600 --> 20:15.953
Thank you.

20:17.640 --> 20:22.634
A few minutes ago, my son asked me
how important this election was to me.

20:23.360 --> 20:26.352
And my answer to him
is that it's very important.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.675
But what's more important?

20:30.080 --> 20:32.196
Believing in your fellow man,

20:32.600 --> 20:35.068
having faith in a person's character,

20:35.760 --> 20:38.957
trusting that a person is
who we think they are,

20:39.040 --> 20:42.396
and defending that trust
until we're given proof

20:42.480 --> 20:45.756
beyond a reasonable doubt
that we should no longer do so.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.638
I wish to concede.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.996
But not the election.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.233
I wish to concede that when I decided
to run for mayor,

20:55.800 --> 20:58.268
I underestimated my opponent

20:58.720 --> 21:02.793
and the depths to which he will go
to hurt and to humiliate others.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.914
You have seen the commercials.

21:06.680 --> 21:09.877
You have seen the real Dan Scott.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.790
Now do the right thing
and vote for Karen Roe.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.754
My opponent has decided to write me off

21:29.480 --> 21:31.914
based on a recent video
that I'm sure you've all seen.

21:32.160 --> 21:36.278
Well, I'd like to tell you that
that video is a fabrication, a fake.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.953
I'd like to tell you that,
but I'm afraid that would be a lie.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.555
It's an accurate depiction
of a man at his worst,

21:47.320 --> 21:48.673
and I'm not proud of it.

21:49.760 --> 21:53.719
And so, today I ask for understanding,
for forgiveness.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.952
For a second chance.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.399
I'm sorry.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.160
They say identification
is the first step to recovery.

22:10.680 --> 22:13.148
I stand before you a man who woke up.

22:14.280 --> 22:15.793
I'm not perfect.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.110
I'm just a guy trying to be a good husband,

22:18.840 --> 22:21.308
and a father
who sometimes comes up short.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.796
And if you elect me,
you'll be electing a work in progress,

22:24.600 --> 22:25.715
but you'll also be electing a man

22:28.440 --> 22:31.273
who will never put himself
above any of you

22:29.640 --> 22:31.551
or above the town that I love.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.469
I woke up to be your mayor,

22:37.120 --> 22:40.112
and I promise
never to sleep on the job again.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.719
Thank you.

22:56.560 --> 22:59.518
Brooke, come on!
Just show us what you have so far.

22:58.400 --> 22:59.879
- Come on!
- Okay.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.317
So, these are just prototypes,

23:03.000 --> 23:07.073
but I introduce you to my new line,
Clothes over Bro's.

23:04.960 --> 23:07.713
- Brooke, that's awesome.
- Thanks, but there's more.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.838
We've got the flaming-heart-ring T.

23:12.720 --> 23:16.235
We have C over B sweats.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.435
I like that.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.318
And the Tutor Girl-P. Sawyer inspired

23:21.640 --> 23:24.438
Clothes over Bro's concert jerseys.

23:24.520 --> 23:27.114
- These are awesome, Brooke. This rocks!
- I know.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.789
But every designer needs her couture line,

23:30.080 --> 23:33.390
so I am now introducing you
to Clothes over Bro's Upscale.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.391
- Whoa!
- Oh, my gosh!

23:43.000 --> 23:44.353
- You made that?
- Brooke!

23:45.360 --> 23:46.839
- I made that.
- Brooke, that's gorgeous.

23:47.480 --> 23:48.993
- Brooke!
- It's so cute, right?

23:49.040 --> 23:50.758
I cannot believe you made these.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.596
Oh, see, that's more me.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.389
- That's so pretty.
- That's cute.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.233
My, my, that dress
equals danger or something.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.669
Trouble.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.034
And they're all available
at clothesoverbros. Com.

24:12.560 --> 24:15.154
- Good work, dude.
- Yay!

24:15.200 --> 24:16.792
Come on, man, slow down.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.758
I'm not in shape like you. I'm weak.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.634
Dude, we're 80 miles from home,
and you gambled my damn car away.

24:26.520 --> 24:27.714
No, not exactly.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.756
Actually, I grabbed your keys right before
Marty punched me in the crotch.

24:32.760 --> 24:36.116
In other news, I actually have
about $500 left on me,

24:37.080 --> 24:39.310
so, basically, we broke even.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.830
What, you call this breaking even?
I thought we were actually winning.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.191
I should've known you can't be honest.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.034
- I can be honest.
- No, you can't.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.798
I kissed Haley at the masquerade party.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.957
Man, I was trying to help you.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.071
See, this is why I'm never honest.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.230
- Stop hitting me.
- Stop kissing my wife!

25:08.560 --> 25:10.551
I will, when you start kissing her.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.517
What the hell is wrong with you?

25:17.440 --> 25:20.113
Listen, the night
you called me to come to town

25:19.440 --> 25:21.317
was the night of the masquerade party.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.191
I thought it'd be funny
if we both went in the same costume.

25:24.560 --> 25:27.120
So, I bribed the guy at the costume shop
to tell me what you rented.

25:26.640 --> 25:30.269
But then I got there, and I saw
you and Haley weren't getting along.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.918
So I thought if I just kissed her...

25:33.200 --> 25:35.077
I know, okay, it was stupid, all right?

25:34.920 --> 25:37.559
But I did it for you. I didn't do it for me.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.431
- So, we even?
- Even?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.594
You kissed my wife,
you lost all my money,

25:46.080 --> 25:47.718
you lied to me about a poker game,

25:48.760 --> 25:51.274
and you got me attacked
by a munchkin and a transvestite!

25:50.480 --> 25:51.469
Whoa, whoa.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.399
You think Emanuelle's a dude?

25:55.360 --> 25:57.874
Emanuelle has an Adam's apple.

25:56.760 --> 25:57.909
Oops.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.832
You wanna know the worst part?

26:03.120 --> 26:05.156
Haley's the one that suffers the most.

26:05.520 --> 26:09.308
She put her heart and soul
into that song, and you screwed her over.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.431
That's nice work.
You should be proud of that.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.631
- Pretty great, huh?
- Yeah.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.275
Hey, I don't think you need
the apostrophe, though, in "Bro's."

26:28.960 --> 26:30.871
It's not really very grammatically correct.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.390
It's my fashion line,
and I'm keeping the apostrophe.

26:33.240 --> 26:36.755
Okay, well, good for you.
You did it all yourself anyway.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.471
Not really. You got me there.

26:39.080 --> 26:42.789
- Yeah, I kind of feel like a big fraud though.
- What? Why?

26:41.960 --> 26:44.030
Because I told you to put yourself
before boys,

26:51.120 --> 26:54.351
You know I told you that Nathan
kissed me at the masquerade party?

26:53.200 --> 26:54.349
Yeah.

26:56.520 --> 26:58.476
It might not have been Nathan.

26:58.480 --> 27:01.472
- I think it might have been Chris.
- Kringle?

27:01.160 --> 27:02.798
No, I didn't think so.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.669
Wow! How could you kiss Chris Keller

27:07.520 --> 27:09.670
and then think that Chris was Nathan? I...

27:09.920 --> 27:13.879
Maybe I just wanted to believe
that it was Nathan so bad that...

27:12.160 --> 27:13.991
What if I was wrong, though?

27:17.880 --> 27:20.713
He could just be trying to keep things
pleasant until the divorce is final.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.957
I do not believe that. I don't.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.159
But it's hard, isn't it?

27:28.240 --> 27:31.198
I mean, I love my clothes,

27:30.760 --> 27:33.638
but there is an ache in my heart
where Lucas used to be.

27:35.800 --> 27:39.793
I don't think covering it up with a stylish
and smartly-priced sweat top

27:40.040 --> 27:41.632
is gonna make it go away.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.519
It is stylish, though.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.799
Well,

27:52.120 --> 27:54.031
what do you know, I got them.

27:54.640 --> 27:55.675
Get out of here.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.832
No, that's everything.
That's the masters, demo.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.793
Bought and paid for.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.917
You only had 500 bucks.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.950
I got a way with people, I guess.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.469
Listen, I'm gonna be taking off.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.354
I may not see you for a while, so...

28:14.120 --> 28:15.678
Whatever.

28:20.040 --> 28:21.712
You sold your guitar?

28:26.400 --> 28:28.675
The thing was waterlogged anyway.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.997
You love that guitar.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.318
Hey,

28:37.960 --> 28:39.439
I guess this makes us even.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.594
Maybe so, but that's not why I did it.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.389
You tell Haley that song's a hit.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.280
Or maybe don't,
unless you wanna lose her again.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.068
Hey!

29:00.960 --> 29:02.678
Where're you going?

29:04.760 --> 29:06.591
Chris Keller's work here is done.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.230
- You find it yet?
- Damn it!

29:24.080 --> 29:25.672
Let me ask you something.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.469
If I have a heart attack, do you die, too?

29:31.840 --> 29:33.159
That's really sweet.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.275
Okay, I'm not arguing with you.

29:36.480 --> 29:40.109
Oh, come on, Peyton!
That's what we do, okay?

29:38.760 --> 29:40.990
We have these inner conversations daily.

29:42.480 --> 29:45.756
Am I gonna look stupid?
Am I pretty enough?

29:45.240 --> 29:47.674
Did Jake just wanna get in my pants?

29:49.280 --> 29:51.669
Should Lucas be with me
instead of Brooke?

29:52.200 --> 29:55.749
No, okay, you're wrong.
Lucas and I are just friends.

29:54.680 --> 29:55.999
And Jake loved me.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.075
Whatever you say, cheerleader.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.959
Poor me, whine, whine, mope, mope.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.397
Always the victim!

30:08.960 --> 30:11.997
My mom died. Jake left. Ellie lied.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.319
Boo-hoo.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.598
You really are a bitch.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.111
I'm not the one that sent Ellie away.

30:18.840 --> 30:22.719
People always leave,
or Peyton always drives them away.

30:23.800 --> 30:25.756
Where's the bracelet, Peyton?

30:29.560 --> 30:32.074
<i>And it looks as though Dan Scott's</i>
<i>narrow lead will hold</i>

30:35.080 --> 30:37.594
<i>in one of the closest decisions</i>
<i>we've ever seen.</i>

30:37.680 --> 30:39.079
<i>Now back to you, Bill.</i>

30:40.280 --> 30:42.748
- It's still close. You never know.
- I'm afraid I do.

30:43.840 --> 30:46.070
Dan Scott's the freaking mayor.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.399
You did your best, Mom. Don't be sad.

30:49.160 --> 30:51.230
It's not that. It's Dan.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.069
And even though he might be wrong
about the fire,

30:55.760 --> 30:59.548
if he thinks it's intentional, he won't stop
until he finds someone to blame.

30:58.240 --> 31:00.470
I worry for that person, Lucas.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.873
I really do.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.148
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

31:08.040 --> 31:11.271
<i>the soon-to-be</i>
<i>Mayor of Tree Hill, North Carolina,</i>

31:09.360 --> 31:11.635
<i>Dan Scott!</i>

31:12.680 --> 31:14.033
Wow!

31:17.280 --> 31:19.840
Hey, thank you so much.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.072
Makes you wonder, huh?

31:29.480 --> 31:32.074
Do the wicked never lose?

31:31.480 --> 31:34.552
Hi, Lucas. How's your mom doing?

31:34.320 --> 31:37.835
She's worried about you.
She just doesn't know it.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.871
What do you mean?

31:43.600 --> 31:45.477
"For everything you've done."

31:54.320 --> 31:56.914
- I don't understand.
- I think you do.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.998
That's the last shred of evidence.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.837
<i>As far as I know, there's nothing else</i>
<i>to tie you to this, Deb.</i>

32:10.880 --> 32:12.677
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>may I have your attention, please.</i>

32:14.080 --> 32:16.071
I have just received word
that in a matter of minutes,

32:15.960 --> 32:19.236
the votes will be in,
and victory will be ours!

32:18.040 --> 32:19.837
He knows it wasn't an accident.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.279
But he doesn't have proof.

32:29.160 --> 32:30.559
They said we were beaten!

32:30.720 --> 32:32.233
They said we were dead!

32:33.960 --> 32:36.030
Maybe this can finally set you free.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.754
But they should know by now,

32:40.720 --> 32:42.676
you can't kill Dan Scott!

32:42.960 --> 32:44.359
I didn't do this alone.

33:01.360 --> 33:05.069
And to that end I'd like to bring out
my beautiful and supportive wife, Deb,

33:03.640 --> 33:05.312
to enjoy the moment with me.

33:07.440 --> 33:11.035
I guess it's true what they say,
"It's lonely at the top."

33:16.240 --> 33:17.673
I can't find it.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.314
Why do you think
Ellie came to see us, Peyton?

33:58.600 --> 34:01.717
She has cancer. She has regrets.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.714
- She's closing up shop.
- She's in remission.

34:04.720 --> 34:08.190
- You know that's a lie. She's dying.
- No, she's not!

34:07.240 --> 34:10.789
- Where is the bracelet, Peyton?
- I lost it, okay!

34:10.800 --> 34:13.871
The last thing she wanted in this world
was to get to know you.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.509
And you sent her away.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.039
Hi, it's me.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.159
Lucas knows.

34:46.960 --> 34:47.995
Hi.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.632
Hey, thanks for coming.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.518
Yeah, thanks for calling me.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.073
What's wrong?

35:08.640 --> 35:10.835
Your song is great, Haley.

35:12.160 --> 35:15.152
Chris played it for me. It's a long story,

35:15.080 --> 35:17.833
but it's really great.

35:18.160 --> 35:21.516
- I just wanted you to know that.
- Oh, okay.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.713
My mom left

35:26.960 --> 35:28.518
for good, I think.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.953
Oh, and apparently,
my dad's the Mayor now.

35:32.280 --> 35:35.829
So, yeah, today has really sucked ass.

35:35.320 --> 35:38.630
Oh, Nathan, I'm so sorry.

35:38.960 --> 35:42.555
You know, for most of my life,
I would have gone through all this alone.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.708
Then I met you,
and I finally found someone

35:50.080 --> 35:52.469
I could depend on when life got like this.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.278
So I guess I called you

35:56.920 --> 35:59.798
'cause I wanted to know
if that was still there.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.230
Nathan, you can always call me.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.273
Always and forever.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.436
I want to ask you something.

36:11.720 --> 36:14.598
The night of the masquerade party,
did we...

36:15.440 --> 36:17.032
Did you kiss me?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.228
Of course I did.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.874
Oh, no, you didn't.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.398
That kiss wasn't half as good as this one.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.915
I love you for lying to me.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.433
Thanks for calling.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.632
Stay with me tonight.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.235
Oh, I was hoping you would say that.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.596
There are 82 letters in here,

37:07.120 --> 37:09.315
and they're all addressed to you.

37:38.920 --> 37:42.799
I wrote them all this summer. One a day,

37:41.640 --> 37:44.438
but I never sent them
because I was afraid.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.355
Brooke...

37:49.640 --> 37:52.029
I was afraid
of getting my heart broken again.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.398
Like before.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.791
'Cause you hurt me so bad,

37:58.920 --> 38:00.717
and I was afraid to be vulnerable.

38:01.600 --> 38:04.717
And I was afraid of you
and the way that you make me feel.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.394
And I know that doesn't matter now
after what I did,

38:06.680 --> 38:09.069
but I just thought that you should know.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.879
This is how I spent my summer, Luke.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.239
Wanting you.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.275
I was just too scared to admit it.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.268
Brooke!

38:26.200 --> 38:27.474
I'm sorry.

38:33.560 --> 38:37.951
What you did with Chris, it's okay.

38:37.760 --> 38:41.435
It's not. It can't be.
It's too much to forgive.

38:40.760 --> 38:44.355
Well, that's too bad, because I forgive you.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.920
- You can't.
- I just did.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.475
So you're gonna just have to deal with it.

38:54.440 --> 38:56.590
I'm the guy for you, Brooke Davis.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.959
And I know I hurt you last time
we were together, but...

39:03.600 --> 39:05.318
I love you.

39:06.480 --> 39:08.072
I love you, too.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.838
Pretty girl.

39:15.080 --> 39:18.117
I found her. Are you happy now?

39:20.840 --> 39:23.559
No, but you are.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.153
You can wake up now.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.558
What's up, guys? It's Brooke Davis.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.560
Want your own piece
