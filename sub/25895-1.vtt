00:14.107 --> 00:21.177
I always felt the greatest excitement
imagining the world beyond the headlights.

00:22.122 --> 00:27.194
The faster I went, the more
seductive this world would become.

00:27.455 --> 00:31.049
I never realized that there
was nothing out there...

00:31.213 --> 00:36.327
that wouldn't turn into the dull street
eternally rushing through the lights.

00:36.874 --> 00:42.123
I never realized that I was just always
searching for her...

00:42.825 --> 00:44.918
like now.

00:46.038 --> 00:48.846
A stranger in a strange country.

00:49.316 --> 00:51.909
A stranger in my own story.

00:57.788 --> 01:00.946
It feels like I've been here before.

01:02.012 --> 01:08.350
She brought me here, she wanted me to come
here to find her.

01:08.955 --> 01:12.722
That's why she turned her diary
into a bestseller.

01:13.122 --> 01:15.799
A road map of her memories.

01:15.997 --> 01:18.734
Just north of the Big Wall.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.402
<i>There's no end in sight
for the ongoing drought...</i>

01:31.426 --> 01:34.371
<i>but we'll be cooling you down
on this hottest day on record.</i>

01:34.396 --> 01:40.025
<i>Yes people. Today, August 13 2019
at 2:15 PM...</i>

01:40.050 --> 01:42.143
<i>Furnace Creek Weather station just recorded...</i>

01:42.168 --> 01:46.246
<i>an ambient air temperature
of a 137Â° Fahrenheit.</i>

01:46.418 --> 01:48.606
<i>Stay in the shade and don't touch the news...</i>

01:48.631 --> 01:50.833
<i>'cause whether they're printing
the truth or not...</i>

01:50.858 --> 01:53.895
<i>the paper may catch fire in your hands.</i>

03:25.862 --> 03:30.246
Each chapter and each word
of her life that we didn't share...

03:30.271 --> 03:32.991
pulled me closer to the ground.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.729
That was my seduction.

03:46.913 --> 03:51.588
Yes, I'm already here.
The appointment is in 15 minutes.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.696
I know.
Everything's perfectly prepared.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.360
No. You call it a day.

03:59.579 --> 04:02.112
Tomorrow we'll have a signed contract.

04:03.692 --> 04:07.130
Without a desalination plant
California will dry out.

04:08.830 --> 04:12.375
I'm not interested in postponing this,
not even for one day.

04:12.699 --> 04:16.079
Yes. Exactly...
'Advance Through Technology'.

04:16.803 --> 04:20.125
Relax, I am not distracted.

04:20.454 --> 04:22.743
I know why I'm here.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.891
I am about to enter now.

04:52.978 --> 04:57.165
The day I arrived in the dessert
Frank died.

04:58.413 --> 05:01.844
Like everything in life fades
under the silver sun that burns...

05:01.869 --> 05:05.361
through the sky like a huge magnifying glass.

05:05.958 --> 05:07.305
His looks...

05:07.489 --> 05:08.868
his smell...

05:09.462 --> 05:12.704
his words faded from my recollection.

05:13.157 --> 05:15.759
The desert became my new life.

05:16.235 --> 05:20.235
I was reborn and everytime
I returned to L.A. it felt like...

05:20.455 --> 05:23.212
life was everything but me.

05:23.397 --> 05:25.364
That was my desert.

05:30.902 --> 05:34.121
The silent ones were my favorites.

05:34.313 --> 05:37.329
They allowed me to enter my own world.

05:37.413 --> 05:39.496
I felt alive in every:

05:39.613 --> 05:41.788
Should I undress?

05:42.171 --> 05:44.563
Brought in back to life.

05:45.157 --> 05:49.295
Every:
<i>Should I undress and play with myself?</i>...

05:49.791 --> 05:52.279
had him touch me again.

05:52.676 --> 05:53.926
Him...

05:54.580 --> 05:55.831
Frank.

08:00.997 --> 08:03.045
1996.

08:03.830 --> 08:06.454
You don't get years like that anymore.

08:06.607 --> 08:08.541
It was my favourite year.

08:09.247 --> 08:13.544
I was going home to my life nude girls show
down on Bikini Lane.

08:13.863 --> 08:16.407
We were dancing and laughing a lot.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.184
Celine Dion was singing:

08:19.530 --> 08:23.032
<i>I'm everything I am because you loved me.</i>

08:27.993 --> 08:29.936
We didn't pick our names.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.747
The owner did.

08:32.158 --> 08:36.785
I became Hope
and my best friend was Destiny.

08:37.582 --> 08:40.929
He said men would fall in love with us
when we were kissing...

08:41.063 --> 08:42.730
and he was right.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.499
Hope kissing Destiny.

08:46.028 --> 08:49.757
The kiss is the beginning of cannibalism.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.300
The mornings at the pool
of the motel nearby...

09:06.325 --> 09:10.334
could double our price
for a private dance at night.

09:10.630 --> 09:14.839
On Mondays when the men who rented
the poolside rooms were gone...

09:15.001 --> 09:19.442
I would dive to the bottom
and wait for Destiny to save me.

09:19.770 --> 09:22.185
I was desperate for her...

09:22.455 --> 09:25.594
just as I was desperate for the 'Bunker'.

13:07.130 --> 13:09.558
<i>Hey, wake up people. You're not dreaming.</i>

13:09.583 --> 13:12.484
<i>With soaring temps you may encounter a mirage.</i>

13:12.509 --> 13:13.803
<i>According to local police...</i>

13:13.827 --> 13:17.116
<i>the driver of the big wreck
that crashed of county state 1-90...</i>

13:17.141 --> 13:19.798
<i>claims he swerved to avoid a huge wall...</i>

13:19.823 --> 13:22.568
<i>with shiny golden ornaments
blocking the highway.</i>

13:22.593 --> 13:25.504
<i>That's right people.
Truth is stranger than fiction!</i>

13:25.663 --> 13:30.800
<i>So keep keeping it real with us
on K-X! T Palm, north of the Big Wall.</i>

13:35.080 --> 13:38.089
Miss Archer? This is Frank calling again.

13:38.247 --> 13:40.353
Yeah. Frank Patrick!

13:42.196 --> 13:46.681
Regarding the book by your client,
Ross Sinclair.

13:48.788 --> 13:53.012
I know but the publisher
put me back in touch with you.

13:53.597 --> 13:54.650
Tonight?

13:54.790 --> 13:56.336
Great!

14:07.913 --> 14:11.685
Found this godforsaken place the other day.

14:12.116 --> 14:14.117
The Armagosa Cemetery.

14:15.009 --> 14:18.030
There was something that drew me to it.

14:19.033 --> 14:21.149
I strolled through the graves...

14:21.313 --> 14:24.370
touched by the variety of memories.

14:25.259 --> 14:28.154
One was dark black marble.

14:28.527 --> 14:32.754
The other one nothing but
a small metal plate on a post.

14:33.295 --> 14:36.324
And one was the memory of a Frank.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.877
I imagined it was him.

14:40.712 --> 14:42.993
Yesterday I went there again.

14:43.638 --> 14:46.641
Visiting 'my' Frank.

14:50.905 --> 14:55.329
Maybe one day I'll lay myself beside him...
again.

14:57.200 --> 15:02.439
But that wouldn't just be another chapter
that would be another book.

15:06.223 --> 15:07.639
Do you really think...

15:07.809 --> 15:12.202
'your' Marie will wanna see you
if you're really 'that' Frank?

15:31.358 --> 15:33.489
No, Frank...

15:34.840 --> 15:37.292
reality exists in the human mind...

15:37.408 --> 15:39.075
nowhere else.

15:40.049 --> 15:42.680
You do understand that your repeated request
to meet the author...

15:42.705 --> 15:44.705
cannot be accommodated.

15:46.494 --> 15:48.623
As I said on the phone...

15:49.361 --> 15:51.334
I'm not a stranger.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.832
But I know that this Ross...

15:55.905 --> 15:59.793
or whatever she calls herself now
is my Marie.

16:01.927 --> 16:03.332
Your Marie?

16:03.965 --> 16:06.210
Yeah, Marie Waltz!

16:06.449 --> 16:08.969
We were close years ago.

16:09.774 --> 16:11.881
She kept diaries.

16:12.195 --> 16:14.457
This book, it's her...

16:14.482 --> 16:16.675
it's our relationship.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.040
Me as a person...

16:19.158 --> 16:21.082
I'm a character in it.

16:21.262 --> 16:24.019
No, not a character in it...

16:24.666 --> 16:26.460
I am in it.

16:27.330 --> 16:29.002
I am Frank.

16:29.760 --> 16:33.458
I've known Ross for twenty years...

16:34.061 --> 16:36.210
there is no Marie.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.104
Tell Marie I'm here.

16:41.244 --> 16:43.268
It's time to go, Frank.

16:44.072 --> 16:46.265
You can let yourself out?

17:09.126 --> 17:10.763
He's here.

17:11.443 --> 17:12.856
Let's get started.

17:13.009 --> 17:16.382
I'll send you a package with instructions.

17:18.020 --> 17:20.861
Make sure you book the girl we discussed.

17:21.106 --> 17:22.358
Yes...

17:22.954 --> 17:24.392
that girl.

17:27.762 --> 17:30.194
Believe me, he'll be there.

17:32.247 --> 17:35.281
He'll follow the locations in the book.

17:35.567 --> 17:39.087
Just make sure he'll find you at the Bunker.

19:45.147 --> 19:47.186
<i>At day 11 in the Sacramento riots...</i>

19:47.211 --> 19:49.264
<i>68 more protesters have been arrested...</i>

19:49.289 --> 19:52.483
<i>following one day's police shooting
of 6, darny illigit assault...</i>

19:52.508 --> 19:55.079
<i>illegals on precinct 13.</i>

19:55.104 --> 19:59.348
<i>The east-side north of Foster Boulevard around
Cal State University has been shut down...</i>

19:59.396 --> 20:02.763
<i>and the National Guard has imposed
an 8 PM curfew.</i>

20:02.788 --> 20:06.606
<i>You're listening to KX! T Palm!
One week before Tuesday's referendum...</i>

20:06.631 --> 20:09.319
<i>the voice of love in the eye of the storm.</i>

20:09.553 --> 20:13.810
Of course I was there, at the front desk
they called off the appointment.

20:14.388 --> 20:17.256
I mean, what can you do?
It's force majeure.

20:18.478 --> 20:21.303
Except for Ed no one is authorized.

20:27.705 --> 20:30.410
Yes, the appointment has just been
postponed for a few days.

20:30.435 --> 20:32.152
Nothing has changed.

20:33.439 --> 20:36.040
Where did you send it?
To the hotel?

20:36.478 --> 20:37.782
No!

20:38.330 --> 20:40.025
I went somewhere else.

20:41.369 --> 20:44.009
I won't be available
for the next few days.

20:44.314 --> 20:46.595
Exactly. I'll be in touch.

21:32.835 --> 21:34.283
The Bunker.

21:35.217 --> 21:38.079
A shell construction of a power plant...

21:38.420 --> 21:41.187
forgotten in the midst of the desert.

21:42.281 --> 21:48.010
The concrete walls were built on someones
illusion of a blossoming future.

21:49.806 --> 21:53.230
Sometimes, when I was chained to them...

21:53.788 --> 21:56.715
I would enter the void surrounding it.

21:57.588 --> 22:02.189
With every beat of the stick
and every slap in my face...

22:03.188 --> 22:06.720
everything spoke so vividly to my soul.

22:07.767 --> 22:09.338
It was a dance...

22:10.538 --> 22:12.423
just another dance.

22:13.872 --> 22:17.883
I reentered life while I was wasting it.

22:22.529 --> 22:24.824
The men were wearing masks...

22:24.991 --> 22:28.763
and a camera was rolling
for their own protection.

22:29.802 --> 22:34.188
I became a movie star of films
that no one would ever see.

22:34.884 --> 22:36.727
It was sublime.

23:38.326 --> 23:39.868
Stay clear.

23:44.614 --> 23:45.814
One...

23:46.996 --> 23:48.196
Two...

23:50.874 --> 23:52.074
Tree...

23:57.693 --> 23:58.893
Four...

24:03.555 --> 24:04.755
Five...

24:20.851 --> 24:22.051
One...

24:28.437 --> 24:29.637
Two...

24:32.304 --> 24:33.504
Tree...

24:34.663 --> 24:35.863
Four...

24:37.024 --> 24:38.577
Stay clear!

24:40.106 --> 24:41.306
Five...

27:58.630 --> 28:01.283
How was it?
- Yeah, it was good.

28:03.512 --> 28:05.004
I'll call you.

28:05.475 --> 28:06.748
Good.

30:55.770 --> 30:58.061
Can I ask you something?

30:58.192 --> 30:59.438
Sure.

31:01.450 --> 31:04.618
That location outside in the desert...

31:06.455 --> 31:08.907
where you had your session.

31:11.396 --> 31:15.421
Is that location known for that kind of stuff?

31:21.645 --> 31:23.249
I understand.

31:24.413 --> 31:27.335
I have to disappoint you,
I don't offer it here.

31:27.434 --> 31:30.483
No, no, I just wanna talk about it.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.782
Let's start without talking.

31:43.946 --> 31:45.688
Should I undress?

31:55.413 --> 31:56.936
Should I...

31:57.637 --> 31:59.444
undress and...

31:59.955 --> 32:01.710
play with myself?

36:23.830 --> 36:27.661
We have this illusion of being
one person for all...

36:28.115 --> 36:32.708
of having a personality that is unique
in all our acts.

36:32.865 --> 36:34.649
But it isn't true.

36:35.485 --> 36:40.383
It would be an atrocious injustice
to judge us by one action alone...

36:40.967 --> 36:45.524
as if all our existence was summed up
in just that one deed.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.704
After all...

36:48.846 --> 36:51.985
a character may always ask who he is.

36:52.853 --> 36:56.415
Because a character really has
a life of his own...

36:56.801 --> 37:00.486
marked with his unique characteristics.

37:00.872 --> 37:04.368
For which reason he's always a somebody.

37:05.915 --> 37:09.274
But a person may very well be a nobody.

37:21.330 --> 37:25.989
I imagine that one day, Frank,
will ask the same question.

37:26.542 --> 37:31.339
I see him driving through deserted streets
searching for me.

37:31.721 --> 37:34.307
And I see him finding some way...

37:34.497 --> 37:36.252
who does what I do...

37:36.684 --> 37:38.790
who talks like I talking...

37:39.301 --> 37:41.926
maybe even thinks what I think.

37:43.074 --> 37:45.028
But that's not my life...

37:45.205 --> 37:47.035
not my diary.

37:47.676 --> 37:49.431
That's Franks life.

38:29.457 --> 38:30.557
Hey.

38:30.803 --> 38:31.903
Hey.

38:31.997 --> 38:34.247
I thought this was your car.

38:34.396 --> 38:35.857
Really?
- Yeah!

38:35.881 --> 38:40.107
And I was hoping to see you again,
and here you are.

38:40.615 --> 38:41.865
Yeah?

38:42.051 --> 38:44.193
Right. What do you think?

38:44.396 --> 38:47.413
Can we grab a coffee sometime together?

38:47.653 --> 38:50.288
Common, you know that's not how it works.

38:50.504 --> 38:52.411
Just come to my show.

38:53.622 --> 38:54.872
Okay.

41:10.723 --> 41:13.623
Destiny read this poem to me today.

41:14.772 --> 41:17.454
'Empty handed I entered the world...'

41:17.718 --> 41:19.824
'Barefoot I leave it...'

41:20.227 --> 41:22.420
'My coming, my going...'

41:23.192 --> 41:27.266
'Two simple happenings that got entangled...'

41:35.415 --> 41:37.376
Yes, I can hear you.

41:40.303 --> 41:42.496
You know our style.

41:43.749 --> 41:47.052
She got a rough break, kinda always do.

41:47.448 --> 41:53.943
The manuscript is fantastic and the first...
the first act is great.

41:57.721 --> 41:59.739
Yes, I've read it.

42:00.965 --> 42:03.071
We're just...

42:07.788 --> 42:09.977
she'd be my second act.

42:17.671 --> 42:20.719
A man falling in love with a ghost.

42:21.968 --> 42:25.214
Yes, it's directly from our diary.

42:25.932 --> 42:28.748
A diary from the realm of the dead.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.131
We'll talk later.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.208
Well...

43:07.832 --> 43:09.675
let me see you walk.

43:10.597 --> 43:11.627
No!

43:11.647 --> 43:13.525
Not like that.

43:17.519 --> 43:21.220
I need you to be more confident, more...
smug.

43:32.397 --> 43:36.803
What with the hair?
I told you it should be open en free.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.303
Not behind the neck.

43:39.511 --> 43:42.205
I tried it and it didn't suit me.

43:43.235 --> 43:45.165
It's not about you.

43:48.684 --> 43:51.064
Do I really look like her?

43:53.069 --> 43:55.877
She's dead, isn't she?

45:58.450 --> 45:59.809
Come in.

46:04.373 --> 46:06.919
Going to the grocery store,
do you need anything?

46:07.059 --> 46:09.843
No, thanks.
I'm leaving for a few days, so.

46:09.984 --> 46:14.042
Going back to L.A.?
- Yeah, with a stop in Joshua Tree.

46:14.230 --> 46:16.246
How is your summer so far?

46:16.468 --> 46:18.253
Not enough Vegas guys.

46:18.278 --> 46:21.073
And what about him?
- Oh, he's from Germany.

46:21.236 --> 46:23.632
I call him the German Hans.

46:24.329 --> 46:25.950
Well, at least the meter's running.

46:25.975 --> 46:29.472
Yeah, I think I'm gonna give him a discount.
He only wants to talk.

46:29.616 --> 46:33.892
I think he's looking for something
or someone. I don't know.

46:35.259 --> 46:37.291
You better watch out.

46:39.647 --> 46:42.040
You wanna come over until he wakes up?

46:42.065 --> 46:44.258
Yeah, give me five minutes.

46:44.707 --> 46:46.011
Sure.

47:14.216 --> 47:17.996
What's gonna save us
when the Vegas guys dry up?

47:18.199 --> 47:21.454
Same thing that saves the country
when it's in crisis.

47:21.624 --> 47:23.093
The movies.

47:25.702 --> 47:27.350
I love the movies.

47:27.525 --> 47:30.046
Will you make me a movie star?

47:31.764 --> 47:32.847
You and me?

47:32.872 --> 47:36.844
Yes, and the sleeping German
will be our director.

47:38.770 --> 47:40.437
You like him, right?

47:43.361 --> 47:47.007
Why don't you hire him
for one of the film jobs?

48:03.170 --> 48:04.931
So? You're awake.

48:05.404 --> 48:07.176
The heat is killing me.

48:07.459 --> 48:09.318
You get used to it.

48:09.809 --> 48:11.064
Great film.

48:11.262 --> 48:13.064
You know it?
- Yeah.

48:13.786 --> 48:15.416
Great artist.

48:15.656 --> 48:17.578
When I was a kid...

48:17.883 --> 48:20.288
I thought my Grandpa was a murderer...

48:20.372 --> 48:22.977
because he looked like Peter Lorre.

48:24.923 --> 48:27.315
Is he still alive?
- No.

48:27.495 --> 48:29.371
Did you get to know him?

48:29.580 --> 48:30.780
No.

48:30.942 --> 48:33.223
Then he could've bin a murderer.

48:35.373 --> 48:36.909
Could've been.

48:37.809 --> 48:40.083
World war two, you know?

48:40.202 --> 48:44.075
Then he probably wasn't Peter Lorre.
- I agree.

48:48.372 --> 48:52.686
An I sleep here tonight?
There are no free rooms around here.

48:52.918 --> 48:56.437
And I've been living in my car since Monday.

48:57.619 --> 48:58.869
Sorry...

48:59.025 --> 49:01.020
that's against the rules.

49:01.923 --> 49:03.173
Get it.

49:03.762 --> 49:06.781
It's also to expensive.
- Yeah.

49:12.923 --> 49:14.986
I'd like to understand.

49:16.909 --> 49:18.627
Understand what?

49:22.360 --> 49:24.293
What drives you?

49:25.517 --> 49:26.908
To what?

49:29.225 --> 49:30.988
To do what you do?

49:36.098 --> 49:37.853
Wanna join in?

49:41.455 --> 49:43.736
Nobody would book me.

49:45.788 --> 49:47.174
I would.

49:51.163 --> 49:52.936
Behind the camera.

49:55.902 --> 49:58.047
Do you have any experience?

50:01.014 --> 50:02.264
Yes.

50:09.348 --> 50:10.548
Okay.

50:10.670 --> 50:14.872
You can sleep at my place tonight
and in return you work for me.

50:23.791 --> 50:26.204
Our top clients wear masks.

50:26.405 --> 50:28.746
They're men in high positions.

50:28.891 --> 50:31.570
They're paying to make a movie,
not for sex.

50:31.734 --> 50:33.311
Only goofing.

50:33.621 --> 50:36.954
So, the films are their protection.

50:37.561 --> 50:39.918
And you'll film to protect them...

50:40.142 --> 50:41.480
and us.

50:42.704 --> 50:44.530
You and me?

50:45.646 --> 50:48.099
No, me and my friend.

50:48.788 --> 50:50.635
Who's that?

50:51.621 --> 50:53.555
You'll meet her.

53:11.139 --> 53:12.926
Tell me if it's to much.

53:13.119 --> 53:14.369
Okay.

53:23.350 --> 53:24.600
Stop.

57:26.603 --> 57:30.337
Found this godforsaken place the other day.

57:32.533 --> 57:34.551
The Armagosa Cemetery.

57:36.905 --> 57:40.401
Nothing but a small metal plate on a post.

58:03.348 --> 58:07.348
Maybe one day I'll lay myself
beside him again.

58:09.248 --> 58:12.589
But that won't be just another chapter...

58:14.247 --> 58:16.353
that'll be another book.

01:05:18.647 --> 01:05:21.162
The client just canceled the session.

01:05:21.353 --> 01:05:23.917
He paid but he's not gonna come.

01:05:24.548 --> 01:05:27.496
In fact he won't be coming back again.

01:05:48.119 --> 01:05:50.874
Destiny was turning her back on me.

01:05:51.637 --> 01:05:56.315
One of her film jobs got canceled
and she blamed it on me.

01:05:57.092 --> 01:06:01.122
People who write diaries
aren't living in the moment.

01:06:01.481 --> 01:06:03.461
She said I should end it.

01:06:03.766 --> 01:06:05.923
Maybe turn it into a book.

01:06:06.453 --> 01:06:08.749
Define a final chapter.

01:06:10.434 --> 01:06:12.878
I think she's jealous of Frank.

01:07:01.163 --> 01:07:04.963
I don't think a moment exists in the moment...

01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:08.447
once you sense that it isn't passed.

01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:10.966
My past is Frank.

01:07:11.974 --> 01:07:14.289
My diary is eternal.

01:07:15.418 --> 01:07:17.436
It is my immortality.

01:07:20.849 --> 01:07:25.734
Don't know if I'll leave this world barefoot
like Destiny once said to me.

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:30.161
I imagine those stairs of my strip club...

01:07:30.498 --> 01:07:33.935
down into the red light as my exit.

01:07:35.288 --> 01:07:40.286
And once I step through the mirrored glass
that divides me from the clients...

01:07:40.497 --> 01:07:42.579
I would finally arrive.

01:10:01.167 --> 01:10:03.362
It was like going home...

01:10:03.674 --> 01:10:07.483
entering into a long since, faded time.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.749
I saw her grave, she doesn't exist.

01:14:19.123 --> 01:14:21.711
Who doesn't exist?
- Your friend...

01:14:21.867 --> 01:14:27.615
September 30th 2001 she died.

01:14:28.991 --> 01:14:31.857
Why did you bring her back to me?

01:14:33.494 --> 01:14:35.146
You scare me.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.909
Life is draining from me.

01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:42.001
I walk with the fear of falling.

01:14:42.372 --> 01:14:44.571
Each page I turned...

01:14:44.903 --> 01:14:47.691
I was in a sort of ecstasy.

01:14:48.066 --> 01:14:51.660
Everything spoke so vividly to my soul.
- Hey, Frank.

01:14:51.763 --> 01:14:54.008
What are you talking about?

01:14:56.467 --> 01:14:57.948
Who are you?

01:15:52.219 --> 01:15:56.341
A character in search of an author
to forgive him.

01:15:57.702 --> 01:16:00.187
I wondered when you'd show up.

01:16:01.363 --> 01:16:03.381
It's her story.

01:16:04.497 --> 01:16:06.407
And it was her life.

01:16:07.088 --> 01:16:09.124
And you found me?

01:16:10.416 --> 01:16:12.069
You thought it was Marie?

01:16:12.203 --> 01:16:14.632
I mean, Marie had talents, but...

01:16:15.114 --> 01:16:18.421
no talents that would reach
beyond her diary.

01:16:18.692 --> 01:16:24.813
Of course, such a bestseller
would need a brilliant mind like yours.

01:16:27.712 --> 01:16:29.625
You took her life.

01:16:31.264 --> 01:16:33.573
You are Destiny, aren't you?

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.096
I loved the woman you destroyed.

01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:42.606
But she always loved you.

01:16:43.006 --> 01:16:46.278
Maybe that's why
she couldn't handle the child.

01:16:46.642 --> 01:16:50.170
Don't worry, I never told the girl
about her father.

01:16:50.307 --> 01:16:53.545
I like to keep my characters in the dark.

01:16:54.098 --> 01:16:57.999
What do you think of her, by the way?
I mean, you've met.

01:16:58.403 --> 01:17:00.026
This is for you.

01:17:12.506 --> 01:17:15.079
Empty handed I entered the world...

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:17.059
barefoot I leave it.

01:17:17.577 --> 01:17:22.313
My coming, my going,
two simple happenings that got entangled.

01:17:24.514 --> 01:17:27.424
In a good story the hero must die.

01:17:57.601 --> 01:17:58.851
Hello!

01:18:01.125 --> 01:18:03.277
Is anybody there?

01:18:07.651 --> 01:18:09.795
Anybody at home?

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:33.805
But she always loved you.

01:18:34.038 --> 01:18:37.457
Maybe that's why
she couldn't handle the child.

01:18:37.697 --> 01:18:40.638
What do you think about her,
by the way?

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:42.892
I mean, you've met.

01:19:45.538 --> 01:19:51.006
<i>Yes people. Today, August 13 2019
at 2:15 PM...</i>

01:19:51.275 --> 01:19:53.368
<i>Furnace Creek Weather station just recorded...</i>

01:19:53.393 --> 01:19:57.524
<i>an ambient air temperature
of a 137Â° Fahrenheit.</i>

01:22:29.413 --> 01:22:30.709
Yes...

01:22:31.161 --> 01:22:33.490
it was like going home...

01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:37.661
entering into a long since faded time.

01:22:38.597 --> 01:22:42.139
I knew I didn't have to search for her
any longer.

01:22:42.591 --> 01:22:44.738
She would find me.

01:24:43.389 --> 01:24:50.739
But seduction is inevitable
No one living escapes it, not even the dead.
