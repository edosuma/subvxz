02:07.036 --> 02:09.913
<i>She was Lo. Plain Lo in the morning.</i>

02:10.872 --> 02:13.042
<i>Standing four feet ten in one sock.</i>

02:14.210 --> 02:16.212
<i>She was Lola in slacks.</i>

02:16.421 --> 02:18.423
<i>She was Dolly at school.</i>

02:19.215 --> 02:21.384
<i>She was Dolores on the dotted line.</i>

02:22.635 --> 02:25.054
<i>In my arms, she was always...</i>

02:25.221 --> 02:27.223
<i>..Lolita.</i>

02:28.933 --> 02:30.935
<i>Light of my life.</i>

02:31.102 --> 02:33.104
<i>Fire of my loins.</i>

02:33.271 --> 02:34.856
<i>My sin.</i>

02:35.022 --> 02:36.607
<i>My soul.</i>

02:36.774 --> 02:38.776
<i>Lolita.</i>

02:42.864 --> 02:45.867
<i>But there might have been
no Lolita at all...</i>

02:46.034 --> 02:48.036
<i>..had I not first met Annabel.</i>

02:55.835 --> 02:57.837
<i>We were both 14.</i>

02:58.838 --> 03:02.300
<i>Whatever happens to a boy
during the summer he's 14...</i>

03:02.467 --> 03:04.594
<i>..can mark him for life.</i>

03:15.813 --> 03:18.066
<i>That hotel you see, the Mirana,...</i>

03:18.232 --> 03:19.817
<i>..that belonged to us.</i>

03:41.923 --> 03:43.925
<i>She wanted to be a nurse.</i>

03:47.470 --> 03:49.472
<i>I wanted to be a spy.</i>

03:53.976 --> 03:58.231
<i>All at once we were madly,
hopelessly in love.</i>

04:41.149 --> 04:43.568
<i>Four months later, she died of typhus.</i>

04:53.578 --> 04:56.372
<i>The shock of her death
froze something in me.</i>

04:56.539 --> 04:58.541
<i>The child I loved was gone.</i>

05:00.752 --> 05:02.754
<i>But I kept looking for her...</i>

05:03.671 --> 05:06.716
<i>..long after I'd left
my own childhood behind.</i>

05:12.847 --> 05:15.099
<i>The poison was in the wound, you see.</i>

05:15.266 --> 05:17.268
<i>And the wound wouldn't heal.</i>

05:28.237 --> 05:31.199
<i>I probably should have
joined the priesthood.</i>

05:31.366 --> 05:35.787
<i>Instead, I accepted a teaching post
at Beardsley College in America.</i>

05:37.372 --> 05:40.041
<i>I had a summer free
before the Fall semester.</i>

05:40.208 --> 05:43.086
<i>I thought I'd finish
a textbook I was working on.</i>

05:43.252 --> 05:46.464
<i>A survey of French literature
for American students.</i>

05:52.762 --> 05:54.764
<i>I took my advance...</i>

05:54.931 --> 05:59.852
<i>..and went to live at the house of friends
of my late uncle's, the McCoos,...</i>

06:00.019 --> 06:02.438
<i>..in the New England town of Ramsdale.</i>

06:05.066 --> 06:08.319
<i>But on arriving, I found
that it was no longer there.</i>

06:13.032 --> 06:14.826
<i>However, a friend of Mrs McCoo,...</i>

06:14.992 --> 06:17.078
<i>..a widow, Mrs Charlotte Haze,...</i>

06:17.245 --> 06:19.038
<i>..agreed to accommodate me.</i>

06:28.548 --> 06:31.259
- Goddamn dog!

06:56.993 --> 06:59.203
One minute. Something's burnin'.

06:59.370 --> 07:00.830
Lord have mercy!

07:00.997 --> 07:02.999
Mrs Haze'll be down in one.

07:05.043 --> 07:09.589
Is that Professor Humbert,
Louise? Tell him I'll be down in one.

07:09.756 --> 07:12.592
She'll be down in one!

07:19.891 --> 07:21.267
Monsieur Humbert.

07:22.685 --> 07:24.353
Uh, yes.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.522
Mrs Haze, is it?

07:27.690 --> 07:29.692
Charlotte.

07:29.859 --> 07:32.445
I am so pleased
to make your acquaintance.

07:32.612 --> 07:36.032
Frank McCoo told me all about
your scholarly pursuits.

07:38.284 --> 07:41.245
I myself just cherish the French tongue.

07:42.580 --> 07:44.582
Um... I wonder, could I...

07:44.749 --> 07:46.584
Mm. Come in.

07:48.544 --> 07:50.755
Harold and I, the late Mr Haze,...

07:50.922 --> 07:52.882
..we simply adored Mexico.

07:53.049 --> 07:56.302
The whole idea
of a culture that sophisticated.

07:56.469 --> 07:58.721
And we think of them as primitive.

07:58.888 --> 08:00.890
I mean, look at us!

08:01.891 --> 08:03.434
Indeed, yes.

08:04.102 --> 08:06.104
Upstairs.

08:06.270 --> 08:08.356
I and Lo have our rooms just there.

08:09.774 --> 08:11.776
And this is your room.

08:11.943 --> 08:14.195
Space for a desk, anything you want.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.866
And at $20 a month,
you can't beat the price.

08:20.326 --> 08:23.121
And here's the bathroom.
It's a bit of a mess.

08:32.462 --> 08:34.881
And this is the kitchen.

08:35.049 --> 08:39.010
Now, if you have any special
food needs, you just say.

08:39.178 --> 08:43.765
I don't know if Ramsdale can provide you
with foie grass, like you're used to.

08:43.933 --> 08:45.435
What's that?

08:46.561 --> 08:49.021
Uh... timetable. For when I um...

08:49.188 --> 08:53.651
I was hoping I wouldn't have to,
but I think I've got to go back to New York.

08:53.818 --> 08:58.823
- Oh, you're not too favourably impressed.
- No... There's a Baudelaire conference...

08:58.990 --> 09:03.327
This is not a neat household,
but you would be very comfortable here.

09:03.494 --> 09:05.329
Very comfortable indeed.

09:05.496 --> 09:08.541
Don't say no until you've seen the piazza.

09:08.708 --> 09:10.710
Come.

09:12.086 --> 09:14.088
Well, I call it the piazza.

09:16.007 --> 09:19.510
It's so much work
to keep it healthy and green.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.722
It's a life's work.

09:24.348 --> 09:26.350
That's my Lo.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.902
And these are my lilies.

09:37.570 --> 09:39.572
I love lilies.

09:39.739 --> 09:43.534
- Lily's a nice name, don't you think?
- Beautiful.

10:30.081 --> 10:32.083
Beautiful!

10:32.792 --> 10:34.711
How much did you say the room was?

11:31.184 --> 11:33.186
<i>A normal man,...</i>

11:33.352 --> 11:36.314
<i>..given a group photograph
of schoolgirls...</i>

11:36.481 --> 11:40.276
<i>..and asked to point out
the loveliest one,...</i>

11:40.443 --> 11:44.030
<i>..will not necessarily choose
the nymphet among them.</i>

11:46.824 --> 11:48.826
<i>You have to be an artist,...</i>

11:50.119 --> 11:55.375
<i>..a madman, full of shame
and melancholy and despair,...</i>

11:55.541 --> 11:59.754
<i>..in order to recognise the little
deadly demon among the others.</i>

12:02.215 --> 12:04.217
<i>She stands...</i>

12:05.718 --> 12:08.763
<i>..unrecognised by them,...</i>

12:08.930 --> 12:12.600
<i>..unconscious herself
of her fantastic power.</i>

12:16.687 --> 12:20.191
- See you later, alligator.
- After a while, crocodile!

12:20.358 --> 12:23.611
- Real soon, Daniel Boone.
- Get fucked, Daffy Duck.

12:46.217 --> 12:52.181
<i># Don't know why...
there's no sun up in the sky</i>

12:52.348 --> 12:55.435
<i># Stormy weather</i>

12:55.893 --> 13:00.273
<i># Since my man and I ain't together...</i>

13:00.440 --> 13:02.442
You woke me up.

13:03.443 --> 13:06.029
- Sorry.

13:09.323 --> 13:11.492
I'll stop.

14:52.552 --> 14:55.430
Dolores!
Have you made your bed?

14:56.431 --> 14:58.224
No, I have not made my bed.

14:58.391 --> 15:01.185
I asked you to make your bed, didn't I?

15:01.352 --> 15:04.063
No. You asked me if I'd made my bed.

15:04.939 --> 15:06.941
Make your bed.

15:08.317 --> 15:10.111
- Now!

15:10.278 --> 15:12.363
<i>I long for some terrific disaster.</i>

15:12.530 --> 15:14.490
<i>Earthquake.</i>

15:14.657 --> 15:16.659
<i>Spectacular explosion.</i>

15:16.826 --> 15:18.619
Make your bed!

15:18.786 --> 15:21.748
<i>Her mother instantly eliminated.</i>

15:23.291 --> 15:26.085
<i>Along with everybody else
for miles around.</i>

15:29.213 --> 15:31.215
<i>Lolita...</i>

15:31.382 --> 15:33.384
<i>..in my arms.</i>

16:07.001 --> 16:09.003
I'm sleepy today.

16:09.962 --> 16:12.048
Me too.

16:13.591 --> 16:16.052
Have you been having trouble sleeping?

16:17.637 --> 16:19.889
You can't imagine.

16:54.966 --> 16:56.551
Am I getting a zit?

16:58.136 --> 17:00.138
What?

17:00.304 --> 17:02.306
Do you see a pimple on my chin?

17:08.604 --> 17:11.315
You look absolutely perfect to me.

17:12.775 --> 17:14.944
Wanna see my chin wobble?

17:16.237 --> 17:17.905
OK.

17:26.998 --> 17:29.000
Humbert!

17:39.594 --> 17:40.636
Humbert...

17:42.346 --> 17:44.557
Is she keeping you up?

17:46.309 --> 17:48.311
I beg your pardon?

17:48.686 --> 17:50.229
No!

17:50.396 --> 17:51.731
No. No, I'm...

17:52.982 --> 17:54.984
No.

17:57.528 --> 18:00.281
Well, it's probably just a 24-hour bug.

18:00.448 --> 18:02.867
He was looking forward to meeting you.

18:03.034 --> 18:05.286
Has anybody seen my other sneaker?!

18:19.217 --> 18:21.552
Your breakfast, Professor Humbert.

18:28.351 --> 18:31.229
Don't tell Mother, but I ate all your bacon.

18:39.696 --> 18:42.824
- Dolores, that was Mrs Farlow.
- So?

18:42.990 --> 18:46.202
Rose has a temperature
and can't go to Hourglass Lake.

18:46.369 --> 18:48.663
- Oh, yeah?
- Do not use that tone with me!

18:48.830 --> 18:50.707
Are you ready for church?

18:50.873 --> 18:53.459
I'm not going to that disgusting church.

18:53.626 --> 18:56.671
- Young lady...
- No picnic, no church.

18:56.838 --> 18:59.674
That is fine with me.
It is your conscience.

18:59.841 --> 19:02.844
I want your room spick-and-span
when I get home.

19:03.010 --> 19:05.972
- And wash your hair, young lady.
- I did wash it!

19:06.139 --> 19:08.141
- When?
- A couple of months ago.

19:28.995 --> 19:30.997
I could be a dancer.

19:34.292 --> 19:36.294
That's a major option.

19:41.007 --> 19:43.009
Cos I do have a natural grace.

19:44.677 --> 19:48.514
- You know. A kind of sad beauty.
- Sort of sad is right.

19:51.392 --> 19:53.561
I'd like to see you dance sometime.

19:53.728 --> 19:57.231
Little girls always want to be
ballerinas, don't they?

19:57.398 --> 19:59.400
I know I did.

19:59.567 --> 20:02.779
But I was - how should I put it? -
a tad too... plump?

20:02.945 --> 20:05.031
- Is that the right word?
- Yes.

20:08.368 --> 20:10.370
I'll get more Vouvray.

20:15.917 --> 20:19.003
Make her take us
to Hourglass Lake tomorrow.

20:19.170 --> 20:21.464
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

20:21.631 --> 20:23.633
She'll do anything you say.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.968
She's getting a thing about you.

20:36.521 --> 20:38.523
Whisper, whisper.

20:38.689 --> 20:41.067
What are you two so cosy about?

20:41.234 --> 20:43.903
Um... Did I ever tell you both that...

20:45.154 --> 20:47.115
..I was once a...

20:47.281 --> 20:49.283
..that I was once a... um...

20:51.369 --> 20:54.914
Uh... that I...
I was once a cook in the North Pole?

20:55.081 --> 20:57.750
- A cook?
- Well, not exactly a cook.

20:57.875 --> 20:59.877
I opened a few cans.

21:01.796 --> 21:05.216
It was a weather expedition.
And I shot a polar bear.

21:05.383 --> 21:07.385
- No!
- Well, I didn't hit it.

21:07.552 --> 21:10.638
Why shoot a polar bear?
That's a lousy thing to do.

21:10.805 --> 21:13.391
Because I found it...

21:13.558 --> 21:17.103
..with its face - listen to this -
in the ice-cream mixer.

21:18.980 --> 21:22.316
I couldn't let that pass
because we lived off ice cream.

21:25.987 --> 21:27.989
You're out of your gourd, Humpy.

21:29.615 --> 21:32.035
Will you stop fidgeting with the doll?

21:33.661 --> 21:36.372
And now we all think
that Lo should go to bed.

21:36.539 --> 21:38.541
Lo?

21:38.708 --> 21:40.710
What do you mean "we", paleface?

21:42.003 --> 21:46.174
So, as I was saying, there I was
with my white polar-bear gun...

21:48.217 --> 21:50.887
- ..to blend in.

21:51.054 --> 21:53.056
It's for me!

21:55.391 --> 21:56.350
Hello?

21:57.185 --> 22:02.190
- No, I'm sorry. She's busy.
- I hope you will forgive her bad manners.

22:02.356 --> 22:04.317
- Now what?!

22:04.484 --> 22:07.028
Look! It's my modern dance creation!

22:11.741 --> 22:14.869
Dolores Haze, turn that music down!

22:17.497 --> 22:21.876
She is a pest. Just slap her hard
if she interferes with your meditations.

22:25.004 --> 22:26.422
Psst!

22:39.102 --> 22:40.853
Hum...

22:41.020 --> 22:45.441
Hum, do you know that I have
one most ambitious dream?

22:45.608 --> 22:47.944
To get a hold of a real trained maid...

22:48.111 --> 22:51.447
..like that German girl
that the Talbots spoke of...

22:51.614 --> 22:53.616
..and have her live in the house.

22:53.783 --> 22:55.785
- No room.
- Oh, chéri, chéri.

22:55.952 --> 22:59.997
You underestimate the possibilities
of our humble household.

23:00.164 --> 23:02.250
We'd put her in Lo's room.

23:02.417 --> 23:05.962
I intended to turn that hole
into a guest room anyway.

23:06.129 --> 23:08.131
But where would Lo sleep?

23:08.297 --> 23:11.592
Little Lo does not enter the picture at all.

23:11.759 --> 23:15.722
Little Lo goes straight from camp
to a good boarding school...

23:15.888 --> 23:19.851
..with strict discipline
and some sound religious training.

23:22.979 --> 23:24.939
I won't go!

23:25.106 --> 23:29.402
I want all of these name tags
sewn on your clothes by tomorrow.

23:30.945 --> 23:32.947
I don't want to go.

23:33.114 --> 23:34.741
I didn't ask your opinion!

23:34.907 --> 23:37.326
I don't want to go and you can't make me.

23:37.493 --> 23:40.663
Look, we all think it's a good idea.

23:40.830 --> 23:45.626
Professor Humbert thinks it's a good idea,
I think it's a good idea, and you are going!

23:49.088 --> 23:50.673
Double-crosser!

23:51.340 --> 23:53.051
Ow!

23:54.010 --> 23:58.097
I asked you to put that suitcase
in the car an hour ago!

23:58.306 --> 24:01.642
Louise, thank you so much
for helping the poor child.

24:04.062 --> 24:08.983
Goddamn it! Dolores, I told you
to put this lunch basket in the back seat!

24:09.150 --> 24:11.361
Why always tell me to do everything?

24:11.527 --> 24:13.738
I'm the one that won't be eating it.

24:13.905 --> 24:17.158
Louise! Brussels sprouts
and meat loaf for dinner.

24:17.325 --> 24:20.411
- All right. Drive careful.
- Thank you. Let's go!

24:20.578 --> 24:22.580
- Bye, my baby.
- Bye, Louise.

24:22.747 --> 24:25.249
- You be good. I'm gonna miss you.
- Agh!

24:26.709 --> 24:28.711
Dolores!

24:28.878 --> 24:31.005
Let's go!

24:31.172 --> 24:32.965
Speed it up!

24:33.132 --> 24:34.884
Get in the car!

24:39.847 --> 24:42.600
Now what?! That child!

24:47.730 --> 24:50.400
- Louise, maybe tenderloin.
- That'd be good.

25:38.489 --> 25:40.491
I'm waiting!

25:41.325 --> 25:44.704
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times...

25:44.871 --> 25:47.290
..not to make me wait in the car.

25:48.499 --> 25:51.753
If you weren't going to camp,
I would ground you.

26:15.818 --> 26:17.820
Mr Humble!

26:17.987 --> 26:20.865
These damn stairs
are gonna be the death of me.

26:21.032 --> 26:22.784
Mr Humble!

26:24.077 --> 26:25.661
Mr Humble!

26:25.828 --> 26:27.830
Mr Humble?

26:31.876 --> 26:33.878
I have something for you.

26:34.045 --> 26:36.214
Oh, yes.

26:36.381 --> 26:39.717
I'm leaving, but I'll be back later.

26:43.012 --> 26:45.598
What the hell he doin' in there?

26:49.310 --> 26:51.521
"This is a confession.

26:51.687 --> 26:53.690
I love you.

26:53.856 --> 26:56.192
I'm a passionate and lonely woman...

26:56.359 --> 26:58.361
..and you are the love of my life.

26:58.528 --> 27:00.530
Now you know.

27:00.697 --> 27:03.116
So please, destroy this letter and go.

27:04.033 --> 27:07.620
I shall return by dinner time
and you must be gone by then.

27:09.330 --> 27:11.874
You see, chéri, if I found you at home,...

27:12.041 --> 27:15.545
..the fact of your remaining
would mean only one thing.

27:15.712 --> 27:19.882
That you want me as much as I do you,
as a lifelong mate,...

27:20.049 --> 27:24.971
..and that you are ready to link up
your life with mine for ever and ever...

27:25.138 --> 27:27.974
..and be a father to my little girl."

27:30.184 --> 27:34.856
<i>Two weeks later,
we were married in a simple ceremony.</i>

27:35.023 --> 27:39.193
<i>Big Haze made sure little Haze
was not in attendance.</i>

27:44.741 --> 27:46.743
Mm. This is bliss.

27:46.909 --> 27:49.328
This is heaven on earth.
Isn't it, Hump?

27:49.495 --> 27:51.497
Mm.

27:54.792 --> 27:57.295
Are you working on your book?

27:57.462 --> 27:59.464
Yes.

28:07.472 --> 28:09.807
Oh, a secret drawer.
What's in there?

28:11.642 --> 28:13.644
Locked-up love letters.

28:15.146 --> 28:17.148
Where's the key?

28:18.107 --> 28:20.401
Hidden.

28:27.158 --> 28:30.286
<i>During the six weeks
we'd been married,...</i>

28:30.453 --> 28:33.956
<i>..I successfully avoided
most of my husbandly duties.</i>

28:37.418 --> 28:42.048
<i>Throughout July, I'd been offering
Charlotte various sleeping tablets,...</i>

28:42.215 --> 28:44.384
<i>..which she gobbled down happily.</i>

28:44.550 --> 28:46.552
<i>She was a great taker of pills.</i>

28:49.055 --> 28:52.934
<i># I'm in the mood for love</i>

28:53.851 --> 28:57.480
<i># Simply because you're near me</i>

28:58.272 --> 29:01.901
<i># Funny, but when you're near me</i>

29:02.568 --> 29:06.197
<i># I'm in the mood for love</i>

29:07.365 --> 29:10.952
<i># Heaven is in your eyes</i>

29:11.119 --> 29:14.706
<i># Bright as the stars we're under</i>

29:15.832 --> 29:19.335
<i># Oh, is it any wonder...</i>

29:19.502 --> 29:23.214
<i>The last dose I had tried
had knocked her out for four hours.</i>

29:23.381 --> 29:27.427
<i>But that was not enough
to guarantee me an undisturbed night.</i>

29:30.388 --> 29:32.390
Hum...

29:33.224 --> 29:35.226
At last!

29:37.311 --> 29:38.688
Mm.

29:40.815 --> 29:42.817
I think I must be immune.

29:45.945 --> 29:49.032
Wh... What would you give me
if you wanted to uh...

29:49.198 --> 29:50.950
..to knock out...

29:51.117 --> 29:52.827
..say, a cow?

29:54.454 --> 29:57.582
J-Just for... seven or eight hours.

29:57.749 --> 29:59.333
So that...

30:01.169 --> 30:04.505
..you know, the cow... would stay asleep?

30:07.008 --> 30:10.511
Even if you were
tossing and turning next to it.

30:11.554 --> 30:13.181
Well...

30:13.347 --> 30:14.724
Why don't you...

30:14.891 --> 30:16.476
..try these?

30:16.642 --> 30:18.227
They're new.

30:19.771 --> 30:22.231
My wife takes them and...

30:22.398 --> 30:25.902
..I don't hear a peep out of her
all night long.

30:27.236 --> 30:29.238
Sounds like just the thing.

30:41.334 --> 30:43.336
I'm home!

30:46.047 --> 30:47.632
Hello?

30:52.845 --> 30:54.430
Hello?

30:55.765 --> 30:57.350
Hello?

31:07.568 --> 31:09.570
"The Haze woman."

31:11.155 --> 31:13.157
"The fat cow"?

31:15.576 --> 31:17.578
"The obnoxious mamma"?

31:21.165 --> 31:25.878
Well, the "old stupid Haze woman"
is no longer your dupe.

31:26.045 --> 31:28.423
Charlotte!

31:30.633 --> 31:33.094
You're a monster.

31:33.261 --> 31:36.723
- You're a despicable, criminal monster.

31:36.889 --> 31:39.559
- Now...
- If you come near me I'll scream!

31:39.726 --> 31:41.811
- Let me just...
- Get away from me!

31:41.978 --> 31:44.105
I'm leaving tonight.

31:44.272 --> 31:46.607
You can keep this house.
I don't care.

31:48.067 --> 31:53.197
But you will never see
that miserable brat ever again.

31:55.950 --> 31:58.703
Now get out of my sight!

32:16.554 --> 32:18.556
Charlotte, you mustn't...

32:18.723 --> 32:20.725
You mustn't ruin our lives.

32:23.144 --> 32:25.146
That's...

32:25.313 --> 32:29.734
That's just...
That's just a fragment of...

32:29.901 --> 32:32.028
..a novel I'm writing.

32:33.946 --> 32:36.282
I used your name on those...

32:36.449 --> 32:38.701
..just for... convenience.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.122
I'll get us a drink.

32:59.347 --> 33:02.558
A nice stiff drink
will clear both our heads.

33:08.064 --> 33:10.483
Charlotte,
I made us a nice stiff drink!

33:12.735 --> 33:14.737
Yes?

33:16.239 --> 33:18.241
But that's ridiculous.

33:19.158 --> 33:23.996
There's this man on the phone
saying you've been killed, Charlotte.

33:24.872 --> 33:26.249
Charlotte?

34:07.248 --> 34:09.583
I'm... I'm sorry.

34:14.964 --> 34:17.050
Stand back, please.

34:18.092 --> 34:20.219
Where's my wife?

34:21.054 --> 34:24.474
- Are you Mr Humbert?
- I am.

34:26.516 --> 34:28.518
She ran right in front of me.

34:28.686 --> 34:30.855
I... I didn't even see her.

34:35.068 --> 34:36.902
Sir?

34:41.282 --> 34:43.284
I'm sorry, sir.

34:43.451 --> 34:45.411
Is this Mrs Humbert?

34:48.831 --> 34:50.375
Sir,...

34:50.541 --> 34:52.585
..is this Mrs Humbert?

34:55.670 --> 34:57.632
Oh, God...

34:58.841 --> 35:02.095
Oh, God... Oh, God!

35:14.440 --> 35:16.818
She was walking to the mailbox.

35:18.027 --> 35:20.279
She was going to mail these letters.

35:22.031 --> 35:23.616
I'm sorry.

35:24.742 --> 35:26.786
Thank you.

35:30.456 --> 35:32.875
I'll go and... lie down, officer.

35:33.084 --> 35:36.170
- Will that be all right?
- You go right ahead, sir.

35:36.337 --> 35:39.298
I'll just be across in the house if you...

37:09.222 --> 37:11.557
Is that the Enchanted Hunters Hotel?

37:11.724 --> 37:13.726
Yes. This is Mr Humbert.

37:13.893 --> 37:15.853
Tomorrow night.

37:16.020 --> 37:18.022
Just the one night, please.

37:19.899 --> 37:21.901
Yes, a room with twin beds.

37:22.068 --> 37:25.613
For two.
Well, one and a half people, really.

37:25.780 --> 37:27.657
It's just for me and my...

37:27.824 --> 37:31.577
..my short... my small daughter.

38:09.782 --> 38:11.701
She should be here any minute.

38:12.201 --> 38:14.954
I sent Charlie for her over at the barn.

38:16.998 --> 38:19.459
- Who's Charlie?
- Come on, come on.

38:21.502 --> 38:25.298
It's such a pleasure to watch
our young people make friends.

38:25.465 --> 38:28.176
- So uh... who is this Charlie?
- Here she is.

38:41.814 --> 38:43.649
Hi, Dad!

38:43.816 --> 38:47.153
# Hum and Mum, Mum and Hum

38:47.320 --> 38:51.324
# Hum and Mum, Mum and Hum

38:51.491 --> 38:53.910
# Hum and Mum, Mum and Hum...

38:54.077 --> 38:57.747
- How's Mum?
- Well... The doctors aren't quite sure.

38:57.914 --> 39:00.166
It's something abdominal.

39:02.502 --> 39:04.003
Abominable?

39:04.670 --> 39:06.172
Abdominal.

39:11.969 --> 39:15.473
She's in a special hospital
over in Lepingville.

39:15.640 --> 39:18.309
So... I thought we'd... we'd...

39:18.476 --> 39:20.853
..go over to Briceland,...

39:21.020 --> 39:24.774
..spend the night there and...
visit the hospital tomorrow.

39:24.941 --> 39:26.776
Or the next day.

39:32.031 --> 39:34.200
So, did you have a good time at camp?

39:34.367 --> 39:36.160
Mm-hm.

39:37.495 --> 39:39.497
You know, I missed you.

39:39.664 --> 39:41.666
I missed you a lot.

39:41.833 --> 39:44.419
Well, I didn't miss you.

39:44.585 --> 39:47.755
In fact, I've been
revoltingly unfaithful to you.

39:47.922 --> 39:51.426
But so what? Cos you don't care
about me any more anyway.

39:51.592 --> 39:54.595
Why do you think I don't care about you?

39:54.762 --> 39:57.807
Well, you haven't
kissed me yet, have you?

40:26.169 --> 40:27.628
Oh!

40:28.838 --> 40:32.383
- Uh, I'm sorry, officer.
- See a blue sedan, same make as yours?

40:32.550 --> 40:37.513
- They might have passed you at the turn.
- Blue sedan? No, I don't think... agh!

40:37.680 --> 40:41.517
- We didn't see a blue sedan.
- No, I don't think we did.

40:41.684 --> 40:45.104
Are you sure it was blue?
I saw one that was more purple.

40:45.271 --> 40:47.398
Or maybe it was more red.

40:47.565 --> 40:49.650
All right, OK. Thank you.

40:50.526 --> 40:53.279
- Thank you!

40:53.446 --> 40:55.782
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

41:11.506 --> 41:13.508
Wow! Looks swank!

41:23.351 --> 41:25.895
<i># No, I will never tell lies</i>

41:26.062 --> 41:29.023
<i># But still I'm called Buttercup...</i>

41:29.190 --> 41:33.069
Good evening. I have a reservation
in the name of Humbert.

41:33.236 --> 41:35.238
Twin-bedded room.

41:35.405 --> 41:38.074
I called last night.

41:38.241 --> 41:40.910
- Two people.
- Oh!

41:41.035 --> 41:42.829
I'm sorry, Mr Humbug.

41:42.995 --> 41:48.334
I held the room with the twin beds for you
till 6:30, but I didn't hear from you.

41:48.459 --> 41:53.965
We hold till 6:30. And with the flower
show and Glory of Christ convention...

41:54.132 --> 41:56.384
My name is not Humbug. It's Herbert.

41:56.968 --> 41:58.469
Humbert.

41:59.846 --> 42:04.100
Just put us in any room. Put a cot in
for my daughter. She's very tired.

42:06.519 --> 42:09.939
Perhaps I could put you in room 342.
It has a double bed.

42:10.106 --> 42:13.568
I expect we'll manage.
My wife may be turning up later.

42:17.447 --> 42:19.449
Please sign here, mister.

42:25.788 --> 42:27.957
It's a nice dog, huh?

42:28.124 --> 42:30.126
I love dogs.

42:32.170 --> 42:34.172
Well, that's my dog.

42:34.338 --> 42:36.049
He likes you.

42:36.215 --> 42:38.760
Doesn't like everybody.

42:41.012 --> 42:43.014
Who does he like?

42:44.182 --> 42:46.351
He can smell when people are sweet.

42:47.393 --> 42:49.270
He likes sweet people.

42:49.437 --> 42:51.939
Nice young people.

42:52.106 --> 42:54.108
Like you.

43:03.034 --> 43:05.036
Here we are.

43:25.264 --> 43:27.266
Thanks very much.

43:29.519 --> 43:32.397
Wait a sec. You mean
we're sleeping in one room?

43:34.273 --> 43:36.401
With one bed?

43:36.567 --> 43:38.903
I've asked them to send up a cot,...

43:39.070 --> 43:41.072
..which I'll use, if you like.

43:45.368 --> 43:47.120
You're crazy.

43:47.286 --> 43:49.831
Why, my darling?

43:49.997 --> 43:51.999
Because, my darling,...

43:52.166 --> 43:56.713
..when my darling mother finds out,
she'll divorce you and strangle me.

43:56.879 --> 43:58.381
Lo,...

43:58.548 --> 44:00.550
..listen to me a moment.

44:00.717 --> 44:03.678
For all practical purposes,
I am your father,...

44:03.845 --> 44:06.264
..and I'm responsible for your welfare.

44:06.431 --> 44:08.975
Now, we're not rich.

44:09.142 --> 44:13.771
So when we travel, we-we're sure to be...
I mean, we'll be thrown together.

44:16.149 --> 44:17.400
Sometimes.

44:17.567 --> 44:20.528
Two people sharing
the same hotel room...

44:20.695 --> 44:23.614
..are bound to... enter into a...

44:23.781 --> 44:25.950
How can I put it? Into a kind of um...

44:26.200 --> 44:28.202
The word is "incest".

44:43.426 --> 44:46.095
I feel like we're grown-ups.

44:46.220 --> 44:48.222
Me too.

44:48.389 --> 44:50.767
We get to do whatever we want, right?

44:50.933 --> 44:52.894
Whatever we want.

44:53.061 --> 44:54.645
Well, now.

44:54.812 --> 44:56.606
Who had the pie?

44:58.107 --> 44:59.650
Me.

45:03.488 --> 45:06.866
Whaddaya think? Are they me?

45:12.246 --> 45:14.248
- Don't look now.
- Why?

45:14.415 --> 45:16.417
The guy over in the corner.

45:17.251 --> 45:19.670
Don't look! He was staring at us.

45:19.837 --> 45:23.216
Don't you think that guy
looks exactly like Quilty?

45:23.383 --> 45:25.843
What, the dentist?

45:26.010 --> 45:28.596
Of course not. His brother.

45:28.763 --> 45:31.849
The writer Quilty.
You know, he writes the plays.

45:32.016 --> 45:35.269
The smoking guy.
He smokes the Dromes in the ad.

45:35.436 --> 45:37.605
We saw him in the lobby with his dog.

45:53.079 --> 45:55.623
If I tell you how naughty I was at camp,...

45:57.417 --> 45:59.419
..you promise you won't be mad?

46:00.420 --> 46:02.422
Tell me later.

46:06.217 --> 46:08.219
I want you to go to bed.

46:09.887 --> 46:12.015
I'll go downstairs while you...

46:13.349 --> 46:15.893
When I come up, I want you to be asleep.

46:16.769 --> 46:18.271
All right?

46:29.991 --> 46:32.076
I've been such a disgusting girl.

46:33.244 --> 46:35.246
Just let me tell you.

46:35.413 --> 46:37.415
Tell me tomorrow.

46:38.624 --> 46:40.626
I'm going to go now. All right?

46:42.253 --> 46:44.255
Good night, Dad.

46:56.100 --> 46:58.102
Night-night.

47:08.905 --> 47:10.907
<i>Gentlewomen of the jury,...</i>

47:12.658 --> 47:15.536
<i>..if my happiness could have talked,...</i>

47:15.703 --> 47:19.707
<i>..it would have filled that hotel
with a deafening roar.</i>

47:20.583 --> 47:22.585
<i>My only regret...</i>

47:22.752 --> 47:27.006
<i>..is that I did not immediately deposit
key number 342 at the office...</i>

47:27.173 --> 47:31.803
<i>..and leave the town, the country,
the planet, that very night.</i>

47:31.969 --> 47:38.059
The Lord knows all,
the Lord sees all, the Lord forgives all.

47:58.871 --> 48:01.290
Where the devil did you get her?

48:08.548 --> 48:12.218
- I beg your pardon?
- I said the weather's getting better.

48:18.474 --> 48:20.476
It seems so.

48:20.643 --> 48:22.645
Who's the lassie?

48:26.566 --> 48:28.568
Um...

48:30.445 --> 48:32.447
It's my daughter.

48:32.613 --> 48:35.408
You lie. She's not.

48:36.826 --> 48:37.785
What?

48:39.203 --> 48:41.205
I said July was hot.

48:43.708 --> 48:46.210
Where's her mother?

48:47.336 --> 48:49.338
Dead.

48:49.505 --> 48:51.466
Oh. Sorry.

48:51.632 --> 48:54.177
Why don't you two
lunch with me tomorrow?

48:54.343 --> 48:57.430
That clerical crowd will be gone soon.

48:58.097 --> 49:00.099
Um...

49:00.558 --> 49:02.560
We'll be gone too, thanks.

49:02.727 --> 49:04.228
Good night.

49:04.395 --> 49:07.440
Sorry. I'm very drunk. Good night.

49:11.277 --> 49:14.447
That child of yours needs a lot of sleep.

49:14.614 --> 49:17.325
"Sleep is a rose" the Persians say.

49:19.827 --> 49:21.829
Smoke?

49:21.996 --> 49:24.207
Not just now, thanks.

49:29.879 --> 49:32.340
Good night.

49:33.174 --> 49:35.176
Enjoy.

51:35.171 --> 51:38.883
Get back in the boat with Charlie.
You don't have to do that.

51:42.011 --> 51:44.222
Back in the boat.

52:02.156 --> 52:04.158
I'm thirsty.

52:09.664 --> 52:11.666
I'll bring you something.

54:47.739 --> 54:50.950
You... You played that with Charlie?
At camp?

54:51.117 --> 54:55.246
Don't tell me you never tried it
when you were a kid.

54:57.498 --> 54:59.709
Never.

55:02.003 --> 55:04.881
I guess I'm gonna have to
show you everything.

55:29.489 --> 55:31.491
<i>Gentlewomen of the jury,...</i>

55:31.657 --> 55:33.659
<i>..I was not even her first lover.</i>

55:46.964 --> 55:48.966
What are you reading?

55:49.133 --> 55:51.010
Nothing.

55:53.346 --> 55:55.473
What's the matter?

55:57.600 --> 55:59.185
Nothing.

56:01.187 --> 56:03.189
Lo...

56:05.441 --> 56:08.903
You know that friend of yours
- Charlie - at camp?

56:10.446 --> 56:12.448
Was he the first one?

56:12.615 --> 56:15.159
Can we please get off the subject?

56:23.710 --> 56:25.962
<i>I felt more and more uncomfortable.</i>

56:27.922 --> 56:30.883
<i>It was something quite special,
that feeling.</i>

56:31.259 --> 56:33.803
<i>An oppressive, hideous constraint,...</i>

56:33.970 --> 56:38.558
<i>..as if I were sitting with the small ghost
of somebody I had just killed.</i>

56:41.894 --> 56:43.271
Jesus!

56:43.438 --> 56:44.939
What?

56:45.106 --> 56:47.358
Can we stop at a gas station?

56:47.525 --> 56:49.944
We can go anywhere you like.

56:50.111 --> 56:52.113
Well, I need a gas station.

56:52.280 --> 56:54.073
I hurt inside.

56:57.160 --> 56:59.245
Well, what do you expect?

56:59.412 --> 57:03.041
I was a daisy-fresh girl,
and look what you've done to me.

57:03.207 --> 57:08.004
I should call the police and tell them
that you raped me, you dirty old man.

57:30.610 --> 57:33.905
- Just wash the windscreen, would you?
- Yes, sir.

58:07.689 --> 58:09.273
Got some cookies.

58:11.317 --> 58:14.529
I want to call Mother in hospital.
What's the number?

58:16.155 --> 58:18.366
Get in. You can't call the hospital.

58:18.533 --> 58:20.326
Why not?

58:21.536 --> 58:23.287
Just get in the car.

58:27.083 --> 58:28.584
Slam the door.

58:31.462 --> 58:34.173
Why can't I call my own mother
if I want to?

58:36.926 --> 58:38.928
Because your mother's dead.

59:35.735 --> 59:37.737
Shh... Shh...

59:48.581 --> 59:51.501
<i>We made up very gently that night.</i>

59:51.667 --> 59:54.712
<i>You see, she had nowhere else to go.</i>

01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:04.972
<i>It was then that we began
our extensive travels...</i>

01:00:05.139 --> 01:00:07.141
<i>..all over the United States.</i>

01:00:07.308 --> 01:00:11.813
<i># Now the native population
and civilisation is fine</i>

01:00:14.399 --> 01:00:18.903
<i># That civilisation
is the thing for me to see</i>

01:00:20.988 --> 01:00:23.825
<i># Whoa, bongo, bongo, bongo</i>

01:00:23.991 --> 01:00:26.994
<i># I don't wanna leave the Congo,
no, no, no, no, no, no</i>

01:00:29.789 --> 01:00:34.585
- When's the best time to buy a bird?
- I don't know. When's the best time?

01:00:34.752 --> 01:00:36.713
When it's going "cheep!"

01:00:36.879 --> 01:00:39.132
Don't say I never gave you anything.

01:00:40.967 --> 01:00:42.844
Ow! Don't! I'm trying to drive!

01:00:46.556 --> 01:00:48.307
Don't do that! Oh, no!

01:00:49.976 --> 01:00:52.061
If it goes out the window, I won't stop.

01:00:52.228 --> 01:00:55.148
Don't! What are these? Hair grips?

01:01:05.366 --> 01:01:07.076
<i># Civilisation</i>

01:01:07.243 --> 01:01:08.661
<i># No, no, no, no</i>

01:01:08.828 --> 01:01:10.830
<i># I'll stay right here</i>

01:01:19.297 --> 01:01:21.299
Look! They have Magic Fingers.

01:01:22.717 --> 01:01:24.469
Good.

01:01:24.635 --> 01:01:26.637
I need to shower.

01:01:28.056 --> 01:01:30.058
Give me a quarter and a dime.

01:01:30.224 --> 01:01:31.726
What for?

01:01:31.893 --> 01:01:34.145
For the Magic Fingers.

01:01:35.229 --> 01:01:37.440
My magic fingers aren't enough?

01:02:04.842 --> 01:02:11.516
# Amor-r-r, amor-r-r, amor-r-r-r-r

01:02:11.683 --> 01:02:16.688
# This w-word s-so s-sweet that I r-repeat

01:02:16.854 --> 01:02:20.608
# Means I adore you-u-u-u-u

01:02:20.775 --> 01:02:27.490
# Amor-r-r-r-r, amor-r-r-r-r, amor-r-r-r-r...

01:02:30.034 --> 01:02:32.036
Good shower for once, Lo!

01:02:32.203 --> 01:02:34.580
First-rate temperature control!

01:02:53.725 --> 01:02:55.268
Ow! Argh!

01:02:55.435 --> 01:02:58.563
- Agh! Lo!
- Hmm?

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:01.941
My God, Lo!
Don't flush when I'm in here!

01:03:26.716 --> 01:03:28.718
What is that?

01:03:29.886 --> 01:03:31.888
What's what?

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:38.519
That thing in your mouth.

01:03:38.686 --> 01:03:40.688
It's a jawbreaker.

01:03:41.814 --> 01:03:45.276
It's supposed to break your jaw.
Want one?

01:03:45.443 --> 01:03:48.905
Just give it to me.
I've had it with that noise.

01:03:53.368 --> 01:03:56.788
- Come on, spit it out. I've got a headache.
- It's good!

01:03:56.954 --> 01:04:00.541
Look, just give it to me, will you?
Spit it out.

01:04:31.406 --> 01:04:34.826
You look a hundred per cent better
when I can't see you.

01:04:34.992 --> 01:04:37.787
<i>We took a circuitous route -
to put it mildly.</i>

01:04:37.954 --> 01:04:41.249
<i>In the back of my mind
was our eventual destination.</i>

01:04:41.416 --> 01:04:46.963
<i>Beardsley College, where I would finally
take up my teaching position.</i>

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:52.093
<i>But in the front of my mind was
the need to keep going, keep driving.</i>

01:04:53.928 --> 01:04:57.390
Lo, that's the last time
I let you drive this car.

01:04:57.557 --> 01:04:58.808
Serve into this square.

01:05:00.643 --> 01:05:02.145
<i>And, despite our tiffs,...</i>

01:05:03.521 --> 01:05:06.691
In the square, Lo.
Try and get it in the square.

01:05:06.858 --> 01:05:11.320
<i>..despite the fuss she made, and
the danger and hopelessness of it all,...</i>

01:05:11.487 --> 01:05:12.947
Aim for my head.

01:05:13.114 --> 01:05:16.034
<i>..despite all that, I was in paradise.</i>

01:05:18.995 --> 01:05:22.999
<i>A paradise whose skies
were the colour of hell flames,...</i>

01:05:25.293 --> 01:05:27.295
<i>..but a paradise still.</i>

01:09:18.734 --> 01:09:22.321
I know you have accepted a post
at Beardsley College,...

01:09:22.488 --> 01:09:26.993
..and I know that there,
academics are first, last and always.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.580
Well, that's not us, Mr Himmler.

01:09:30.747 --> 01:09:33.499
Uh... Here at Beardsley Prep,...

01:09:33.666 --> 01:09:35.752
..what we stress are the three Ds.

01:09:35.917 --> 01:09:39.212
Dramatics, dancing and dating.

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:44.260
Now, I know that the Reverend Rigger is
behind us on this. Aren't you, Reverend?

01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:48.180
- All the way, Miss Pratt. Every inch.
- So you see, Mr Humper,...

01:09:48.348 --> 01:09:53.435
..for the modern preadolescent, medieval
dates are less vital than weekend ones.

01:09:55.271 --> 01:09:58.358
- What? Weekend what?
- Dates, Mr Humping.

01:09:58.524 --> 01:10:01.194
Uh... boys.

01:10:10.912 --> 01:10:12.914
<i># By myself alone at home</i>

01:10:13.081 --> 01:10:14.665
<i># Feelin' blue</i>

01:10:14.832 --> 01:10:18.795
<i>I was not quite prepared
for the reality of my dual role.</i>

01:10:18.961 --> 01:10:22.548
<i>On the one hand,
the willing corrupter of an innocent,...</i>

01:10:22.715 --> 01:10:25.677
<i>..and on the other,
Humbert the happy housewife.</i>

01:10:27.887 --> 01:10:29.889
Where's the river Rhine?

01:10:31.766 --> 01:10:33.768
I don't know.

01:10:33.935 --> 01:10:35.937
You should know that.

01:10:36.104 --> 01:10:39.065
- Why?
- Big battles there in the Great War.

01:10:42.235 --> 01:10:44.237
Where's the river Seine?

01:10:45.905 --> 01:10:47.907
I don't know.

01:10:48.074 --> 01:10:51.536
I thought you were supposed
to have learnt these.

01:10:51.703 --> 01:10:53.705
It's not what I'm on.

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.834
It seems to be pretty relaxed,
this school of yours.

01:11:00.753 --> 01:11:03.464
<i># When I was a kid about half past three</i>

01:11:03.631 --> 01:11:06.050
<i># My ma said
"Daughter, come here to me"</i>

01:11:06.217 --> 01:11:09.178
<i># Says "Things may come
and things may go"</i>

01:11:09.345 --> 01:11:11.848
<i># "But this is one thing
you ought to know"</i>

01:11:12.015 --> 01:11:15.143
<i># "Oh, t'ain't what you do,
it's the way that you do it"</i>

01:11:15.309 --> 01:11:17.854
<i># "T'ain't what you do,
it's the way that you do it"</i>

01:11:18.021 --> 01:11:20.857
<i># "T'ain't what you do,
it's the way that you do it"</i>

01:11:21.024 --> 01:11:21.983
<i># "That's what...</i>

01:11:48.634 --> 01:11:50.636
I'm supposed to be in a play.

01:11:51.888 --> 01:11:54.307
- What play?
- I don't know.

01:11:54.515 --> 01:11:56.517
Some play.

01:11:58.311 --> 01:12:00.313
At school.

01:12:04.567 --> 01:12:06.986
With the boys from Butler's Academy?

01:12:09.447 --> 01:12:11.866
I don't know.

01:12:12.033 --> 01:12:14.035
Maybe.

01:12:15.745 --> 01:12:17.747
I don't think it's a good idea.

01:12:19.332 --> 01:12:21.751
You're depriving me of my civil rights.

01:12:21.918 --> 01:12:24.504
Where did you learn that language?

01:12:27.882 --> 01:12:29.884
I'm intelligent.

01:13:04.877 --> 01:13:07.547
I have a right to be in a play if I want.

01:13:09.215 --> 01:13:11.217
Not if I say you don't.

01:13:26.774 --> 01:13:28.776
D'you like that?

01:13:34.115 --> 01:13:36.117
You want more, don't you?

01:13:54.385 --> 01:13:56.387
I want things, too.

01:13:58.348 --> 01:14:00.350
What?

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.853
Things.

01:14:05.646 --> 01:14:08.358
You know how my allowance
is a dollar a week?

01:14:10.026 --> 01:14:12.028
Yes, I know.

01:14:12.195 --> 01:14:14.614
Well, I think it should be two dollars.

01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:26.459
I said, I think it should be two dollars.

01:14:30.797 --> 01:14:32.715
A dollar fifty.

01:14:42.642 --> 01:14:45.353
I really do think it should be two dollars.

01:14:49.148 --> 01:14:50.358
Am I right?

01:14:51.734 --> 01:14:53.611
Am I right?

01:14:56.072 --> 01:14:57.865
God, yes.

01:14:58.032 --> 01:14:59.826
Two dollars.

01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:03.287
And I get to be in the play.

01:15:07.834 --> 01:15:10.878
Oh, rosy mistress of the night.

01:15:11.045 --> 01:15:13.548
You have enchanted
many a hunter's heart.

01:15:13.715 --> 01:15:16.801
But this time, my temptress,...

01:15:16.968 --> 01:15:18.845
..you have met your match.

01:15:19.012 --> 01:15:21.889
For far more than a hunter,...

01:15:22.056 --> 01:15:23.433
..I...

01:15:25.351 --> 01:15:27.020
..am a poet.

01:15:27.186 --> 01:15:30.815
- The night has fallen, Rodrigo.
- The...

01:15:30.982 --> 01:15:32.483
Hold it! Hold it! Mona...

01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:35.528
Give us a moment.
I'd like a word with Dolores.

01:15:37.363 --> 01:15:41.659
When you say "your larking charms",
use your charms for the hunter.

01:15:41.826 --> 01:15:43.745
Because you're the witch.

01:15:43.911 --> 01:15:46.414
You're bringing the hunter to your lair.

01:15:48.207 --> 01:15:50.209
- Hi, Mr Humbert.
- Hello, Mona.

01:15:51.377 --> 01:15:53.171
Some play, huh?

01:15:53.338 --> 01:15:56.174
You're nymphs.
Use your nymph's charms.

01:15:56.341 --> 01:15:57.759
Seduce the hunter.

01:15:57.925 --> 01:15:59.927
Look. See right there?

01:16:00.845 --> 01:16:05.266
That's the actual playwright, Clare Quilty.
Can you believe it?

01:16:05.433 --> 01:16:07.894
Let the music transform you.

01:16:08.061 --> 01:16:10.605
You'll feel that you've become a witch.

01:16:10.772 --> 01:16:14.484
- You're a witch!

01:16:14.650 --> 01:16:17.904
- This play any good, Mona?
- Yeah. It's very political.

01:16:18.071 --> 01:16:20.073
Witch! Witch!

01:16:20.239 --> 01:16:22.200
More wind! More wind!

01:16:22.367 --> 01:16:24.035
You're a witch!

01:16:24.202 --> 01:16:26.204
Aren't you?

01:16:26.371 --> 01:16:28.373
More wind! I need more wind!

01:16:29.582 --> 01:16:31.793
The witches now! The witches' dance!

01:16:31.959 --> 01:16:33.336
In the wind!

01:16:38.216 --> 01:16:41.135
<i>As she grew cooler
towards my advances,...</i>

01:16:41.302 --> 01:16:44.639
<i>..I became accustomed
to purchasing her favours.</i>

01:16:45.473 --> 01:16:48.434
<i>Where she hid the money,
I never knew.</i>

01:16:49.394 --> 01:16:50.353
Stop it!

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:55.066
<i>I was convinced she was storing it away
in order to finance her escape from me.</i>

01:16:58.194 --> 01:17:01.614
You can't expect me to pay extra
in the middle!

01:17:01.781 --> 01:17:03.533
Ow! Argh!

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.411
She's a lovely child, Mr Haze,...

01:17:06.577 --> 01:17:10.915
..but the onset of sexual maturing
seems to be giving her trouble.

01:17:11.082 --> 01:17:15.294
- Isn't that your observation, Reverend?
- To the tee, Miss Pratt.

01:17:15.461 --> 01:17:19.924
So, you see, it is the general impression
that 14-year-old Dolores...

01:17:20.091 --> 01:17:24.303
..is morbidly disinterested
in sexual matters.

01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:27.724
Does she never speak
about these... matters?

01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:29.559
Well...

01:17:29.726 --> 01:17:31.686
That's just it.

01:17:40.278 --> 01:17:41.654
What's just it?

01:17:41.821 --> 01:17:43.823
That's... just it.

01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:46.200
She hasn't said anything.

01:17:46.367 --> 01:17:48.661
She hasn't breathed a word.

01:17:51.497 --> 01:17:53.499
Uh... But who has?

01:17:57.211 --> 01:18:00.006
Are... Are you saying that I've...

01:18:00.173 --> 01:18:02.175
Exactly.

01:18:02.342 --> 01:18:04.802
This is a very serious matter.

01:18:04.969 --> 01:18:07.055
What we're trying to say to you...

01:18:07.221 --> 01:18:09.640
..is that someone in the family,...

01:18:09.807 --> 01:18:12.018
..maybe you,...

01:18:12.185 --> 01:18:14.771
This is very difficult for me.

01:18:14.937 --> 01:18:16.981
Well, let me put it this way.

01:18:17.148 --> 01:18:21.152
Someone in the family
ought to instruct that dear child...

01:18:21.319 --> 01:18:23.738
..in the process of human reproduction.

01:18:23.905 --> 01:18:25.573
I'm so sorry.

01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:28.534
- I'm so sorry.
- I see that I've embarrassed you.

01:18:28.701 --> 01:18:32.205
Yet you, as her father,
ought to take the matter well in hand.

01:18:32.372 --> 01:18:35.416
Yes. Worry not, Miss Pratt.

01:18:37.752 --> 01:18:40.088
I... um... I have... this matter in hand.

01:18:40.254 --> 01:18:42.006
Oh, well,...

01:18:42.173 --> 01:18:44.717
..that's all I need to say.

01:18:55.978 --> 01:18:56.938
Yes?

01:18:58.231 --> 01:18:59.816
Oh, yes?

01:19:02.151 --> 01:19:03.736
She missed?

01:19:05.738 --> 01:19:07.240
Oh.

01:19:07.824 --> 01:19:09.200
Bye.

01:19:17.333 --> 01:19:19.419
How are the piano lessons going?

01:19:19.585 --> 01:19:21.587
Fine.

01:19:21.754 --> 01:19:24.674
Great. Excellent. Wonderful.

01:19:24.841 --> 01:19:26.843
Terrif. Perfect.

01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:29.470
Especially since you missed the last two.

01:19:34.308 --> 01:19:36.310
Where were you?

01:19:41.774 --> 01:19:43.776
Where was I?

01:19:43.943 --> 01:19:46.195
I should have told you before.

01:19:48.614 --> 01:19:52.035
I was in the park.
I was rehearsing the play with Mona.

01:19:52.201 --> 01:19:54.203
That's your story?

01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:56.372
That's what I was doing.

01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:59.292
OK. Give me Mona's phone number.

01:19:59.459 --> 01:20:03.629
- Mona's phone number?
- Just give me Mona's phone number.

01:20:03.796 --> 01:20:06.507
Klausen 57241.

01:20:20.313 --> 01:20:22.315
Is Mona there, please?

01:20:23.441 --> 01:20:27.570
- Mona, this is Dolores' father.
- Oh, hello, sir.

01:20:27.737 --> 01:20:29.739
Mona, were you and Dolores...

01:20:29.906 --> 01:20:33.951
..rehearsing the play in the park
for the past two Tuesday afternoons?

01:20:34.118 --> 01:20:35.703
Um... Let's see.

01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:37.413
The last two Tuesdays?

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:41.042
One of them, Mona, was yesterday.

01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:44.003
You know, sir, that's... absolutely right.

01:20:44.170 --> 01:20:46.172
I feel awfully bad about it.

01:20:46.339 --> 01:20:48.216
I alone am to blame, sir.

01:20:48.383 --> 01:20:51.678
The whole rehearsing in the park thing
was my idea.

01:20:51.844 --> 01:20:54.889
We did it cos we didn't want
to get on your nerves.

01:21:01.437 --> 01:21:03.439
Well?

01:21:03.606 --> 01:21:05.900
Did she confirm?

01:21:06.067 --> 01:21:08.069
She did.

01:21:08.236 --> 01:21:11.572
And I've no doubt
she'd been well instructed by you.

01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:18.121
In fact, I've no doubt
you've told her all about us.

01:21:25.044 --> 01:21:26.879
Look, Lo, this has got to stop.

01:21:27.046 --> 01:21:30.633
I don't know what you're up to,
but whatever it is,...

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:35.638
..I'll yank you out of Beardsley as fast as
I can pack a suitcase unless this stops!

01:21:35.805 --> 01:21:37.181
Unless what stops?

01:21:37.348 --> 01:21:39.851
- You know what!
- Take it easy, mister!

01:21:40.018 --> 01:21:43.438
- Show me every penny...
- Leave me alone, you pervert!

01:21:43.604 --> 01:21:47.900
- You're running away from me, I know.
- Yes, I am! Anyone'd run away from you!

01:21:48.067 --> 01:21:50.528
- Show me what you hid!
- I earned that money!

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.204
Go ahead, murder me.
Like you murdered my mother.

01:22:00.371 --> 01:22:01.247
I'm sorry.

01:22:01.414 --> 01:22:03.791
Murder me like you murdered my mother!

01:22:03.958 --> 01:22:04.959
Shut up. Shut up!

01:22:05.126 --> 01:22:07.670
Murder me like you murdered my mother!

01:22:07.837 --> 01:22:10.006
- Stop that!
- Go ahead! Murder me!

01:22:10.173 --> 01:22:13.051
Go on, murder me!
I'm asking you to murder me!

01:22:13.217 --> 01:22:15.219
- Shut up!
- Murder me! Murder me!

01:22:15.386 --> 01:22:19.015
- Dolores, shut up!
- I hate you! I hate you!

01:22:19.182 --> 01:22:21.184
Calm down.

01:22:21.351 --> 01:22:23.019
- Calm down!

01:22:23.186 --> 01:22:26.064
- Come back, Lo!

01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:28.900
Murderer!

01:22:29.067 --> 01:22:30.401
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:22:31.736 --> 01:22:33.571
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:22:41.537 --> 01:22:46.000
I do not know who you people think
you are, screaming and carrying on!

01:22:46.167 --> 01:22:49.504
My daughter's friend.
I'm sorry. I really can't stay.

01:24:14.756 --> 01:24:17.759
Oh, good. I was just trying
to reach you at home.

01:24:17.925 --> 01:24:20.803
- I've come to a decision.
- You have?

01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:22.764
Yeah.

01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:24.932
So buy me a drink.

01:24:25.099 --> 01:24:27.101
What would you like?

01:24:27.268 --> 01:24:29.437
Um... I'd like, uh, ice-cream soda...

01:24:29.604 --> 01:24:31.606
..with extra chocolate syrup.

01:24:31.773 --> 01:24:33.775
Please.

01:24:35.485 --> 01:24:38.154
Nothing for me, thanks.

01:24:52.210 --> 01:24:53.169
Lo...

01:25:14.399 --> 01:25:15.983
So tell me.

01:25:22.198 --> 01:25:24.492
What's the rush?

01:25:41.384 --> 01:25:43.803
Pay her and let's blow this joint.

01:26:00.194 --> 01:26:02.196
<i>And do you know what she said,...</i>

01:26:02.363 --> 01:26:05.533
<i>..this girl who had been spurning me,
mocking me,...</i>

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:08.786
<i>..plotting her escape from me
only hours before?</i>

01:26:08.953 --> 01:26:12.290
<i>She said she wanted
to leave Beardsley then and there.</i>

01:26:12.457 --> 01:26:14.667
<i>She wanted to take another trip,...</i>

01:26:14.834 --> 01:26:17.962
<i>..only this time she would choose
where we would go.</i>

01:26:18.129 --> 01:26:20.798
- OK? I choose? OK?
- Yes.

01:26:21.466 --> 01:26:23.885
<i>Did Humbert hum his assent?</i>

01:26:24.052 --> 01:26:26.054
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:28.222
<i>I sealed my fate gratefully.</i>

01:27:09.555 --> 01:27:11.557
Lolita.

01:27:14.936 --> 01:27:17.188
Take me to bed.

01:27:39.252 --> 01:27:41.754
Look out for cigarette hangover.

01:27:41.921 --> 01:27:43.589
<i>Hi. I'm Clare Quilty.</i>

01:27:43.756 --> 01:27:46.092
<i>Remember, over a million smokers...</i>

01:27:46.259 --> 01:27:48.261
So we have to be in...

01:27:49.303 --> 01:27:51.305
..Wace in exactly one week.

01:27:51.472 --> 01:27:53.558
But why Wace in a week?

01:27:53.725 --> 01:27:58.855
Cos we gotta see the... ceremonial dances
when they open the Magic Caves.

01:27:59.022 --> 01:28:02.400
And... exactly two weeks
and four days later,...

01:28:02.567 --> 01:28:05.111
..we have to arrive in Elphinstone. See?

01:28:07.196 --> 01:28:08.698
Yes.

01:28:08.865 --> 01:28:11.034
That's where we climb the Red Rock.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.038
We have to climb this rock
exactly two weeks and four days later?

01:28:15.204 --> 01:28:17.206
Exactly.

01:28:17.373 --> 01:28:19.375
Oh, I'm so excited.

01:28:42.315 --> 01:28:47.528
<i>I cannot tell you the exact day I first knew
for certain that we were being followed.</i>

01:29:08.883 --> 01:29:12.970
Lo, reach into the glove compartment
and get the pad and pencil.

01:29:17.266 --> 01:29:20.144
Got it? Now write this down.

01:29:21.312 --> 01:29:23.106
Connecticut.

01:29:23.272 --> 01:29:24.649
How do you spell that?

01:29:24.816 --> 01:29:26.275
C-O-N-N.

01:29:26.442 --> 01:29:27.944
Is that it?

01:29:28.111 --> 01:29:29.696
No. Now write down...

01:29:29.862 --> 01:29:31.364
..PJ...

01:29:31.531 --> 01:29:33.491
..44...

01:29:33.658 --> 01:29:35.535
..396.

01:29:36.994 --> 01:29:38.746
All right, give it to me.

01:29:44.502 --> 01:29:46.045
All right.

01:29:46.212 --> 01:29:49.632
Put it in the glove box.
Don't put gum on it cos it'll get...

01:29:49.799 --> 01:29:52.135
Why have you got your gum everywhere?

01:29:52.301 --> 01:29:53.928
Put that in the glove box.

01:29:54.929 --> 01:29:57.015
There's a detective following us.

01:29:59.517 --> 01:30:01.936
He looks rather like my Uncle Gustave.

01:30:13.573 --> 01:30:15.575
<i>He was clever, our pursuer.</i>

01:30:15.742 --> 01:30:17.744
<i>He kept changing cars.</i>

01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:20.121
<i>But his presence was as real to me...</i>

01:30:20.288 --> 01:30:22.290
<i>..as my own breath.</i>

01:30:28.004 --> 01:30:32.842
<i>Then suddenly he would disappear
and I'd wonder if I'd imagined everything.</i>

01:31:50.670 --> 01:31:52.422
Lo! What did that man say to you?

01:31:52.588 --> 01:31:55.633
# Bags around your eyeballs
which is red instead of white

01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:58.886
- What did he say to you?
- The guy I was talking to?

01:31:59.053 --> 01:32:01.723
- Yeah. Look...
- # Shucks, I shoulda known...

01:32:01.848 --> 01:32:03.850
Just tell me what he said to you.

01:32:04.017 --> 01:32:06.894
He asked me if I had a map.
He must've been lost.

01:32:07.061 --> 01:32:09.063
# My heart's plumb gone

01:32:09.230 --> 01:32:11.482
# Cos you used temptation

01:32:12.692 --> 01:32:15.820
# It'd be thrilling... if 'n you're willing

01:32:15.987 --> 01:32:20.658
Look, I've told you about
talking to strangers. You've no idea...

01:32:20.825 --> 01:32:22.827
Lo, listen to me.

01:32:22.994 --> 01:32:26.664
You're very young
and people can take advantage of you.

01:32:26.831 --> 01:32:28.833
Very hard to imagine.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.794
That man was the cop
who's been following us.

01:32:31.961 --> 01:32:34.756
You have to tell me
exactly what you told him.

01:32:34.922 --> 01:32:39.344
If he really is a cop, the worst thing
we can do is let him know we're scared.

01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:41.679
Then he'll know that we're guilty.

01:32:41.846 --> 01:32:43.848
Or rather, that you're guilty.

01:32:53.524 --> 01:32:57.987
<i># Don't sit under the apple tree
with anyone else but me...</i>

01:33:06.287 --> 01:33:08.289
# With anyone else but me

01:33:08.456 --> 01:33:11.250
# With anyone else but me, no, no, no

01:33:38.528 --> 01:33:40.697
# With anyone else but me, no, no, no

01:33:40.863 --> 01:33:42.782
# Anyone else but you

01:33:42.949 --> 01:33:45.952
# No, no, don't go under the apple tree

01:33:50.623 --> 01:33:53.710
There's something wrong
with the steering.

01:33:53.876 --> 01:33:55.962
Oh, whoa!

01:33:56.129 --> 01:33:57.463
Ow! Watch it!

01:33:58.589 --> 01:34:00.425
What are you doing?!

01:34:06.055 --> 01:34:07.932
You got a flat, mister.

01:34:39.547 --> 01:34:41.549
<i># Open the door, and let me in</i>

01:34:47.638 --> 01:34:49.807
<i># Richard, why don't you open the door?</i>

01:35:03.279 --> 01:35:04.781
Hey...

01:35:04.947 --> 01:35:06.532
Hey!

01:35:06.699 --> 01:35:08.493
Hey, you! Come back here!

01:35:11.079 --> 01:35:12.038
Lo!

01:35:12.205 --> 01:35:13.581
Lo! Lo!

01:35:13.748 --> 01:35:14.707
Lo!

01:35:14.874 --> 01:35:16.292
Put on the handbrake!

01:35:16.459 --> 01:35:19.003
Pull the handbrake up! Lo!

01:35:21.255 --> 01:35:24.384
Lo! Pull on the handbrake. Stop the car.

01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:27.470
Put the handbrake on. Down there! Pull it!

01:35:27.637 --> 01:35:29.138
- Ow!

01:35:30.515 --> 01:35:31.599
Jesus Christ!

01:35:31.766 --> 01:35:34.477
What did you think you were doing?

01:35:34.644 --> 01:35:36.646
You should thank me.

01:35:36.813 --> 01:35:39.065
The car was rolling and I stopped it.

01:35:41.901 --> 01:35:44.570
You should thank me.

01:35:48.408 --> 01:35:51.285
Pass me the pad
in the glove compartment.

01:35:53.746 --> 01:35:56.582
It was smart of us
to write his number down.

01:36:00.044 --> 01:36:01.421
What...?

01:36:01.587 --> 01:36:03.256
What have you...

01:36:15.393 --> 01:36:16.978
Lo...

01:36:31.325 --> 01:36:33.328
Lo...

01:36:38.583 --> 01:36:40.585
Lo, I'm sorry.

01:36:40.752 --> 01:36:43.421
- I'm sorry!

01:36:51.137 --> 01:36:53.806
Come here. Come here.

01:36:53.931 --> 01:36:55.933
Get away!

01:36:57.435 --> 01:36:59.645
Lo...

01:36:59.812 --> 01:37:01.814
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:37:01.981 --> 01:37:03.441
I'm sorry.

01:37:28.383 --> 01:37:31.469
Shall I walk down to the town
and get you some fruit?

01:37:32.595 --> 01:37:34.597
Bananas.

01:37:43.481 --> 01:37:45.483
Just bananas?

01:37:46.818 --> 01:37:49.737
Just bananas.

01:38:01.290 --> 01:38:04.419
<i># Open the door, Richard</i>

01:38:04.585 --> 01:38:08.089
<i># Open the door and let me in</i>

01:38:08.256 --> 01:38:10.925
<i># Open the door, Richard</i>

01:38:11.050 --> 01:38:15.763
<i>- # Richard...</i>
- # Why don't you open that door?

01:38:24.897 --> 01:38:29.027
<i># Borrow confidently from HFC</i>

01:38:29.193 --> 01:38:33.823
<i>Quilty can't be here in our studio
because he's in Wace, Texas tonight...</i>

01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:36.993
<i>..working on the premiere
of his brand-new play.</i>

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.996
<i>But I want to welcome
his writing partner,...</i>

01:38:40.163 --> 01:38:43.291
<i>..the lovely and talented
Miss Vivian Darkbloom.</i>

01:38:43.458 --> 01:38:45.668
<i>Let's give her a warm Texas welcome.</i>

01:39:16.115 --> 01:39:18.284
You've been out.

01:39:19.410 --> 01:39:21.412
I just got up.

01:39:26.542 --> 01:39:28.544
Don't lie to me.

01:39:32.715 --> 01:39:34.717
Well, I did go out for a second.

01:39:35.927 --> 01:39:39.722
You were gone so long.
I wanted to see if you were coming back.

01:40:29.564 --> 01:40:32.525
You tell me who it is! Who is it?

01:40:32.692 --> 01:40:35.194
Who is it? Tell me who it is.

01:40:37.196 --> 01:40:39.615
You tell me. Who is it?

01:40:40.616 --> 01:40:41.534
Who...?

01:40:41.701 --> 01:40:44.495
- Tell me.

01:40:44.662 --> 01:40:45.747
Please, tell me.

01:40:57.967 --> 01:40:59.594
Please tell me.

01:40:59.761 --> 01:41:01.763
Please tell me.

01:41:13.524 --> 01:41:15.318
Please tell me.

01:41:17.487 --> 01:41:19.030
Please!

01:41:19.197 --> 01:41:21.032
Please... tell... me!

01:41:21.199 --> 01:41:23.201
Please... please...

01:41:24.243 --> 01:41:26.245
Please...

01:41:26.412 --> 01:41:28.414
..tell me!

01:41:28.581 --> 01:41:29.791
Please...

01:41:29.957 --> 01:41:31.167
..please...

01:41:31.334 --> 01:41:32.669
..please...

01:43:19.776 --> 01:43:21.778
I'll show you to room number 29.

01:43:21.944 --> 01:43:23.946
It's one of our nicer rooms.

01:43:24.113 --> 01:43:27.492
Say, what's wrong
with your little daughter? Is she ill?

01:43:27.659 --> 01:43:30.078
Oh, no. She's just feeling a bit... um...

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:35.625
My God, Lo!

01:43:35.792 --> 01:43:37.377
Are you all right?

01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:41.047
I don't feel... I don't feel very well.

01:43:41.881 --> 01:43:43.883
It's a virus.

01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:47.136
Nothing serious.
I've had 40 cases in two weeks.

01:43:47.303 --> 01:43:50.973
- So can I take her home?
- We're gonna keep her here overnight.

01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:53.309
Keep her hydrated, help her sleep.

01:44:04.529 --> 01:44:08.074
Why don't you get some sleep?
It won't help if you catch it.

01:44:08.241 --> 01:44:10.702
I think I have already.
I feel dreadful.

01:44:10.868 --> 01:44:12.870
- Maybe I should stay.
- Go.

01:44:13.037 --> 01:44:14.956
Call us in the morning.

01:44:15.123 --> 01:44:17.333
- Here, I'll take those.
- Thank you.

01:44:47.321 --> 01:44:49.449
Uh, yes, hello. This is Mr Humbert.

01:44:49.615 --> 01:44:53.536
I'm calling to see how my... daughter,
Dolores Haze, is.

01:44:53.703 --> 01:44:55.705
Oh, she's much better.

01:44:55.872 --> 01:44:58.166
She was up early. No trace of fever.

01:44:58.333 --> 01:45:01.586
And when Uncle Gustave came for her,
we signed her out.

01:45:03.338 --> 01:45:06.007
Who? Wh... Wh... Who?

01:45:06.132 --> 01:45:08.384
Uncle Gustave, Dolores called him.

01:45:08.551 --> 01:45:12.180
He had a sweet little dog.
He was the nicest man. Had a big smile.

01:45:12.347 --> 01:45:13.723
Wait, Ted.

01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:17.935
- And you let her go with him?
- Oh, yes. He paid the bill in cash.

01:45:18.102 --> 01:45:22.940
They said to tell you not to worry,
and they'll be at Grandpa's expecting you.

01:45:23.107 --> 01:45:26.778
- Then they went off in that nice Cadillac.

01:45:26.944 --> 01:45:28.946
Hello?

01:45:47.048 --> 01:45:48.591
Hey!

01:45:48.758 --> 01:45:50.426
Hey!

01:46:00.311 --> 01:46:01.270
Nurse!

01:46:01.437 --> 01:46:03.439
- Where is she?
- Who?

01:46:03.606 --> 01:46:06.067
Who took her?
Somebody took my daughter.

01:46:06.234 --> 01:46:09.195
- You need to talk to the doctor.
- But who took her?

01:46:09.362 --> 01:46:11.531
My daughter was in there last night.

01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:13.992
- Who took her away?
- Hey, relax, pal!

01:46:14.158 --> 01:46:17.620
Don't tell me to relax!
I'm looking for my daughter! Doctor!

01:46:17.787 --> 01:46:19.497
Doctor! Doctor!

01:46:19.664 --> 01:46:21.666
What have you done with her?

01:46:21.833 --> 01:46:23.918
Where is she? Where is she?

01:46:24.127 --> 01:46:26.838
Tell me where she is! Where is she?

01:46:27.005 --> 01:46:29.590
Where has she gone?
Where? Where? Where?

01:46:32.051 --> 01:46:34.137
You leave me alone, you bastards!

01:46:34.303 --> 01:46:36.014
You fucking fiends!

01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:38.182
Tell me where she is!

01:46:40.435 --> 01:46:42.437
Get me to that man!

01:46:44.313 --> 01:46:46.858
I'm just looking for my daughter!

01:46:48.026 --> 01:46:51.571
- I said relax!
- I want to know where she -

01:46:53.531 --> 01:46:56.242
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:46:56.409 --> 01:46:57.869
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:46:58.036 --> 01:46:59.746
Sorry.

01:46:59.912 --> 01:47:02.081
I'm sorry. I'm just a little bit...

01:47:02.248 --> 01:47:06.127
I think I may just have...
had a little too much to drink. Sorry.

01:47:06.294 --> 01:47:09.589
I'm very worried
about my daughter, you see.

01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:12.216
But she's with her Uncle Gustave.

01:47:12.383 --> 01:47:14.385
So she'll be all right.

01:47:14.552 --> 01:47:16.721
I'm very sorry. Please forgive me.

01:47:16.888 --> 01:47:19.223
She's gone to her... grandpa's farm.

01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:22.435
She'll be absolutely fine there.

01:47:22.602 --> 01:47:24.604
What better place for her?

01:47:24.771 --> 01:47:27.106
I'm... I'm fine.

01:47:27.273 --> 01:47:29.275
Please, I'm sorry.

01:47:29.442 --> 01:47:31.444
So sorry. Thank you very much.

01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:33.613
Sorry... Sorry.

01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:35.782
So sorry.

01:47:50.838 --> 01:47:52.840
<i>I searched all our old haunts...</i>

01:47:53.007 --> 01:47:56.594
<i>..and for several months
the trail remained warm.</i>

01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:03.559
<i>The thief, the kidnapper,
whatever you want to call him,...</i>

01:48:03.726 --> 01:48:05.395
<i>..he was clever.</i>

01:48:05.561 --> 01:48:07.563
<i>He would disguise his name.</i>

01:48:07.730 --> 01:48:10.274
<i>But I could always tell his handwriting.</i>

01:48:11.776 --> 01:48:13.569
Um... Sir!

01:48:17.824 --> 01:48:19.909
<i>He had very peculiar Ts, Ws and Ls.</i>

01:48:20.076 --> 01:48:22.578
Do you know his name?

01:48:24.163 --> 01:48:26.165
What does he look like?

01:48:28.626 --> 01:48:30.628
- Let me help.
- No, please...

01:48:32.630 --> 01:48:35.216
Ladies, I'm sorry. We're trying to find...

01:48:35.383 --> 01:48:38.636
<i>It must be hard
for you who already know who it was...</i>

01:48:38.803 --> 01:48:41.055
<i>..to understand my mystification.</i>

01:48:49.647 --> 01:48:52.316
<i>Or maybe you think
I was imagining things.</i>

01:48:52.483 --> 01:48:54.068
..my daughter.

01:48:55.361 --> 01:49:00.074
<i>Maybe you think it impossible that
there could have been another like me.</i>

01:49:00.241 --> 01:49:05.038
<i>Another mad lover of nymphets following
us over the great and ugly plains.</i>

01:49:05.204 --> 01:49:07.415
<i>Well, you are right, of course.</i>

01:49:07.582 --> 01:49:09.584
<i>There was no-one else like me.</i>

01:49:18.843 --> 01:49:21.387
<i>Eventually the trail went cold and dead.</i>

01:49:25.683 --> 01:49:28.353
<i>And I went back to cold, dead Beardsley.</i>

01:50:23.032 --> 01:50:25.910
"Dear Dad, how's everything?"

01:50:26.911 --> 01:50:29.330
"I'm married. I'm going to have a baby."

01:50:31.666 --> 01:50:34.377
"I guess it'll come
right around Christmas."

01:50:36.337 --> 01:50:38.464
"This is a hard letter to write."

01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:41.592
"I'm going nuts
because we don't have enough...

01:50:41.759 --> 01:50:44.095
..to pay our debts and get out of here."

01:50:45.638 --> 01:50:48.391
"Dick has been promised
a big job in Alaska."

01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:52.979
"Are you still mad at me?"

01:50:54.188 --> 01:50:59.110
"Please send us a cheque, Dad. We could
manage with three or four hundred,...

01:50:59.277 --> 01:51:01.654
..or even less. Anything is welcome."

01:51:02.447 --> 01:51:05.616
"I have gone through
much sadness and hardship."

01:51:05.783 --> 01:51:07.785
"Yours expecting, Dolly."

01:51:09.454 --> 01:51:11.456
"Mrs Richard F...

01:51:13.583 --> 01:51:15.585
..Schiller."

01:52:34.998 --> 01:52:37.375
Well!

01:53:08.239 --> 01:53:10.241
Come in.

01:53:23.212 --> 01:53:25.214
You, Molly, stay out.

01:53:25.381 --> 01:53:27.216
Good girl.

01:53:27.383 --> 01:53:29.802
Husband at home?

01:53:29.969 --> 01:53:31.763
Yeah.

01:53:31.929 --> 01:53:34.891
Where do you wanna sit?
The rocker or the divan?

01:53:35.975 --> 01:53:37.977
Come sit with me on the divan.

01:53:44.859 --> 01:53:46.444
Is that him?

01:53:47.904 --> 01:53:49.864
Up the ladder?

01:53:50.031 --> 01:53:52.700
You want me to call him in?

01:53:53.618 --> 01:53:55.370
No.

01:53:55.536 --> 01:53:58.206
He's not the one I want.

01:53:59.957 --> 01:54:02.251
He's not the what?

01:54:02.418 --> 01:54:04.545
You know what I mean.

01:54:04.712 --> 01:54:06.923
Where is he?

01:54:07.090 --> 01:54:09.092
Look...

01:54:09.676 --> 01:54:14.222
Dick has nothing to do with all that stuff.
He thinks you're my father.

01:54:14.389 --> 01:54:16.641
Please don't bring up all that muck.

01:54:18.393 --> 01:54:21.729
- All right, I'll find out myself.
- You really don't know?

01:54:28.987 --> 01:54:30.989
My God, Dad, it was Quilty.

01:54:31.155 --> 01:54:33.282
It was Clare Quilty.

01:54:41.416 --> 01:54:43.418
Yes.

01:54:48.923 --> 01:54:51.050
Yes, of course.

01:55:10.111 --> 01:55:11.904
Quilty.

01:55:13.031 --> 01:55:15.033
Yeah.

01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:20.913
He was the only man
I was ever really crazy about.

01:55:25.710 --> 01:55:27.920
What about me?

01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:57.492
Where did he take you?

01:56:01.537 --> 01:56:03.790
Just tell me.

01:56:04.999 --> 01:56:07.835
Well, everybody knew he liked little girls.

01:56:08.002 --> 01:56:12.882
He used to film them in his mansion
over in Parkington, Pavor Manor.

01:56:15.343 --> 01:56:18.513
But I wasn't gonna do all those things.

01:56:20.014 --> 01:56:22.016
All what things?

01:56:22.183 --> 01:56:24.268
Two girls and two boys or...

01:56:24.435 --> 01:56:26.521
..I don't know, three or four men.

01:56:26.688 --> 01:56:29.148
And Vivian was filming the whole thing.

01:56:29.315 --> 01:56:33.152
I said "No, I'm not gonna blow
all those beastly boys."

01:56:33.319 --> 01:56:35.446
"I want you."

01:56:38.783 --> 01:56:40.660
So he threw me out.

01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:52.422
<i>I looked and looked at her...</i>

01:56:54.465 --> 01:56:57.760
<i>..and I knew,
as clearly as I know that I will die,...</i>

01:56:57.927 --> 01:57:02.515
<i>..that I loved her more than anything
I'd ever seen or imagined on earth.</i>

01:57:06.644 --> 01:57:10.606
<i>She was only the dead leaf echo
of the nymphet from long ago...</i>

01:57:11.858 --> 01:57:14.235
<i>..but I loved her, this Lolita,...</i>

01:57:14.402 --> 01:57:17.864
<i>..pale and polluted
and big with another man's child.</i>

01:57:18.031 --> 01:57:21.200
<i>She could fade and wither - I didn't care.</i>

01:57:23.202 --> 01:57:25.872
<i>I would still go mad with tenderness...</i>

01:57:25.997 --> 01:57:27.999
<i>..at the mere sight of her face.</i>

01:57:51.522 --> 01:57:53.524
Lolita...

01:57:55.818 --> 01:57:59.906
From here to that old car
that you know so well...

01:58:00.073 --> 01:58:02.325
..is a stretch of 25 paces.

01:58:05.119 --> 01:58:07.622
Make those 25 steps...

01:58:07.789 --> 01:58:09.791
..with me, now.

01:58:09.957 --> 01:58:14.379
You're saying you'll give us some money
if I go to a motel with you?

01:58:14.545 --> 01:58:16.506
No... No!

01:58:16.673 --> 01:58:21.177
I'm saying leave here and come live
with me, die with me, everything with me.

01:58:22.345 --> 01:58:24.347
You're crazy.

01:58:24.514 --> 01:58:27.225
If you refuse, you still get the money.

01:58:27.392 --> 01:58:28.810
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:58:30.603 --> 01:58:32.605
There. Have it.

01:58:41.614 --> 01:58:43.491
Oh my God.

01:58:43.658 --> 01:58:46.953
You're giving us four thousand bucks?

01:58:50.206 --> 01:58:51.833
- Thank you...
- No...

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.002
Don't touch me.

01:58:54.168 --> 01:58:56.170
I'll die if you touch me.

01:58:57.505 --> 01:59:02.218
Just tell me...
there's a chance you'll come with me.

01:59:04.012 --> 01:59:06.014
No, honey.

01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:08.516
I'd almost rather go back with Clare.

01:59:11.978 --> 01:59:13.980
Oh...

01:59:14.147 --> 01:59:16.149
I'll go now.

01:59:18.276 --> 01:59:22.613
- Can I call Dick in to say goodbye?
- No. I don't want to see him, at all.

01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:25.825
I just want to go.

01:59:35.293 --> 01:59:38.504
Lo, can you ever forget
what I've done to you?

01:59:43.676 --> 01:59:45.678
Say goodbye, Molly.

01:59:46.763 --> 01:59:48.765
Say goodbye to my dad.

02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:58.126
Dick! Guess what!

02:01:19.063 --> 02:01:21.399
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,...</i>

02:01:21.566 --> 02:01:26.487
<i>..I have to say that I regret all I did
before that last goodbye in Coalmont.</i>

02:01:28.531 --> 02:01:32.118
<i>But I regret nothing of what came after.</i>

02:03:08.089 --> 02:03:10.091
Now, who are you?

02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:15.972
Are you, by any chance, Brewster?

02:03:22.353 --> 02:03:25.148
You know, you don't look
like Jack Brewster.

02:03:25.314 --> 02:03:28.818
I mean, the resemblance
is not particularly striking.

02:03:28.985 --> 02:03:33.489
Somebody told me he had a brother
with the same phone company.

02:03:33.656 --> 02:03:35.658
I'm neither of the Brewsters.

02:03:42.707 --> 02:03:44.208
Pull over!

02:03:45.293 --> 02:03:46.794
Pull over!

02:03:50.006 --> 02:03:52.425
Do you recall a little girl named...

02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:56.054
..Dolores Haze?

02:04:00.266 --> 02:04:02.685
You see, I'm her father.

02:04:04.062 --> 02:04:05.563
Nonsense.

02:04:05.730 --> 02:04:09.192
You're a foreigner.
You're an agent of a foreign power.

02:04:09.359 --> 02:04:11.444
You're a foreign literary agent.

02:04:11.611 --> 02:04:14.030
She was my daughter.

02:04:14.197 --> 02:04:16.199
She was my child.

02:04:16.366 --> 02:04:18.743
Oh, you know,
I adore children myself.

02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:20.912
And fathers...

02:04:21.079 --> 02:04:23.122
I love fathers.

02:04:26.668 --> 02:04:28.461
Ah...

02:04:28.628 --> 02:04:29.587
Sit down!

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:33.299
Oh. There they are.

02:04:33.466 --> 02:04:35.718
Now we need matches.
You got a light?

02:04:35.885 --> 02:04:38.471
Quilty, I want you to concentrate.

02:04:41.849 --> 02:04:43.518
You're about to die.

02:04:43.685 --> 02:04:46.020
Ooh.

02:04:53.987 --> 02:04:55.571
Jesus!

02:04:56.948 --> 02:05:01.244
Do you want to be executed
standing up or sitting down?

02:05:01.411 --> 02:05:04.831
Just let me think, let me think.
It's not an easy question.

02:05:04.998 --> 02:05:07.458
Try to understand what is happening.

02:05:07.625 --> 02:05:08.459
I- I- I- I...

02:05:08.626 --> 02:05:12.005
- Remember Dolores Haze.
- I'm willing...

02:05:12.171 --> 02:05:15.508
I'm willing to try. I am. Just...

02:05:15.675 --> 02:05:17.343
OK. Listen.

02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:19.512
I made a mistake, which I regret,...

02:05:19.679 --> 02:05:21.597
..sincerely.

02:05:21.764 --> 02:05:27.270
I couldn't have any fun with your Dolly.
I'm practically impotent is the sad truth.

02:05:27.437 --> 02:05:32.150
But she had a swell vacation, met some
remarkable people. Hey, do you know -

02:05:46.873 --> 02:05:48.333
Stay still!

02:05:50.043 --> 02:05:52.003
Oh, God...

02:05:52.837 --> 02:05:54.839
You cheated me.

02:05:57.467 --> 02:05:59.469
You cheated me of my redemption.

02:06:01.971 --> 02:06:05.641
- You have to die.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

02:06:05.808 --> 02:06:09.645
My memory and my eloquence
are not at their best today.

02:06:09.812 --> 02:06:14.150
But really, you have to admit
you were never an ideal stepfather.

02:06:14.317 --> 02:06:16.319
Hm?

02:06:16.486 --> 02:06:18.946
I did not force your protégée to join me.

02:06:19.113 --> 02:06:22.116
It was she who made me
remove her to a happier home.

02:06:22.283 --> 02:06:24.577
Look around you. See?

02:06:24.744 --> 02:06:26.746
You see this house?

02:06:26.913 --> 02:06:31.501
It's very cool in the summer. Comfortable.
I suggest that you move in, hm?

02:06:34.337 --> 02:06:36.547
I think you'll be happy here.

02:06:37.632 --> 02:06:39.634
You can use my wardrobe.

02:06:40.593 --> 02:06:43.763
We have the most reliable
and bribable charwoman.

02:06:43.930 --> 02:06:46.391
"Cleaning lady" is the American term.

02:06:46.557 --> 02:06:50.144
She has not only daughters,
she has granddaughters.

02:06:50.311 --> 02:06:53.606
And I know a thing or two
about the chief of police...

02:06:53.773 --> 02:06:55.817
..that makes him my slave.

02:06:55.984 --> 02:06:58.069
My slave. Drop the gun.

02:06:58.236 --> 02:07:00.738
And here's another thing...--
Drop the gun.

02:07:00.905 --> 02:07:04.784
...I have, upstairs,
the most unique collection of erotica.

02:07:04.951 --> 02:07:06.327
Drop the gun. Drop the gun.

02:07:06.494 --> 02:07:10.623
Also, moreover, I can arrange
for you to attend executions.

02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:13.793
Not everybody knows
the chair is painted yellow.

02:07:16.295 --> 02:07:17.672
Somebody help!

02:08:23.321 --> 02:08:24.989
Aargh! Agh!

02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:27.992
That hurts, sir.

02:08:28.159 --> 02:08:30.745
That hurts atrociously, my dear fellow.

02:08:41.422 --> 02:08:43.424
God...

02:08:43.591 --> 02:08:46.678
You should not continue
in this fashion, really.

02:09:17.375 --> 02:09:19.168
Get out!

02:09:19.335 --> 02:09:21.004
Get out of here!

02:11:30.383 --> 02:11:33.761
<i>What I heard then was
the melody of children at play.</i>

02:11:33.928 --> 02:11:35.930
<i>Nothing but that.</i>

02:11:38.307 --> 02:11:41.477
<i>And I knew that
the hopelessly poignant thing...</i>

02:11:41.644 --> 02:11:44.480
<i>..was not Lolita's absence from my side...</i>

02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:49.193
<i>..but the absence of her voice
from that chorus.</i>

02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:12.582
<i># When I was a kid about half past three</i>

02:16:12.749 --> 02:16:15.084
<i># My ma said
"Daughter, come here to me"</i>

02:16:15.251 --> 02:16:18.212
<i># Says "Things may come
and things may go"</i>

02:16:18.379 --> 02:16:20.923
<i># "But this is one thing
you ought to know"</i>

02:16:21.090 --> 02:16:24.344
<i># "Oh, t'ain't what you do,
it's the way that you do it"</i>

02:16:24.510 --> 02:16:27.597
<i># "T'ain't what you do,
it's the way that you do it"</i>

02:16:27.764 --> 02:16:30.308
<i># "T'ain't what you do,
it's the way that you do it"</i>

02:16:30.475 --> 02:16:32.477
<i># "That's what gets results"</i>

02:16:38.733 --> 02:16:41.402
<i># You've learned your ABCs</i>

02:16:41.527 --> 02:16:44.072
<i># You've learned your DFGs</i>

02:16:44.237 --> 02:16:48.325
<i># But this is something
you don't learn in school</i>

02:16:50.161 --> 02:16:52.871
<i># So get your hip boots on</i>

02:16:53.039 --> 02:16:55.375
<i># And then you'll carry on</i>

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:58.378
<i># But remember, if you try too hard</i>

02:16:58.544 --> 02:17:00.546
<i># It don't mean a thing</i>

02:17:00.713 --> 02:17:01.880
<i>Take it easy!</i>

02:17:02.048 --> 02:17:04.467
<i># T'ain't what you make,
it's the way that you make it</i>

02:17:04.634 --> 02:17:07.344
<i># T'ain't what you snake,
it's the way that you snake it</i>

02:17:07.512 --> 02:17:10.223
<i>- # T'ain't what you sing
- # It's the way that you sing it</i>

02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:12.933
<i>- # That's what gets results

02:17:13.101 --> 02:17:15.770
