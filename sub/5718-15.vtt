WEBVTT

00:04.372 --> 00:06.807
Okay, Mom,
have a safe flight.

00:06.874 --> 00:09.510
(CHUCKLES)
Yes, I'll call
and check in on Dad.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.680
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Please don't send us
anything from Korea.

00:12.746 --> 00:15.049
Because we still have
three pounds
of roasted silkworm

00:15.116 --> 00:17.418
from your last trip!

00:17.485 --> 00:19.087
Okay, no. Here.
The kids want
to say goodbye.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.827
Aww, they're
blowing kisses.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.531
Okay, safe flight.
Love you, too.

00:30.598 --> 00:31.899
(CHUCKLES)

00:31.965 --> 00:33.267
Whew!

00:33.334 --> 00:34.835
For the next two weeks,
she's Korea's problem.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.605
Have fun, Korea!

00:37.671 --> 00:39.407
Well, she's a picnic
next to your father.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.209
We're going on a picnic?

00:41.275 --> 00:43.544
(SCOFFS) Come on.
My dad's not that bad.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.913
Oh, yeah.
Tell us again about that time
when you were a kid

00:45.979 --> 00:48.282
and you thought
you saw him smile.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.451
Look, my sister
saw it, too,
so I'm not lying.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.987
He's got a good heart.
So he's a little gruff.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.456
A little gruff?

00:55.523 --> 00:57.258
At our wedding,
he told my cousin Janice

00:57.325 --> 00:58.892
she was dressed
like a tramp.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.060
Was he wrong?

01:00.128 --> 01:01.529
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

01:04.632 --> 01:06.367
Dad?

01:06.434 --> 01:08.102
What are you
doing here?

01:08.169 --> 01:10.338
Is that mom's suitcase?
Did she forget it?

01:10.404 --> 01:12.606
No. Mom gone.
I stay with you.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.442
Quality time.

01:14.508 --> 01:17.878
Um, D.K., did we
miss an e-mail
from you about this?

01:17.945 --> 01:20.381
No e-mail.
Quality time!

01:30.591 --> 01:32.926
Ugh.

01:32.993 --> 01:35.095
Hey, why'd you leave
Lisa's party last night?

01:35.163 --> 01:37.131
Oh, I caught a cold.

01:37.198 --> 01:41.101
Now my head hurts,
I'm dehydrated,
and kind of queasy.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.203
Did you drink
too much?

01:42.270 --> 01:43.871
Not alcohol.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.006
I just had nine glasses
of that punch

01:46.073 --> 01:47.608
with all the fruit in it.

01:47.675 --> 01:48.842
The sangria?

01:48.909 --> 01:50.711
I guess.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.714
Anyway, that virus
hit me so hard,

01:53.781 --> 01:57.851
I barfed all over
my Uber driver.

01:57.918 --> 02:00.854
And then I needed
to go home and make
mac and cheese.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.792
And then I fell asleep
on my kitchen counter.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.260
I never do that.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.564
Okay, couple of things.
Um...

02:10.631 --> 02:13.567
There is alcohol
in nine sangrias...

02:14.968 --> 02:17.438
And your mystery virus
is a hangover.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.540
What?

02:19.607 --> 02:22.109
I have a hangover?
Mmm-hmm.

02:22.176 --> 02:25.546
Wow. I'm kind of
a cool-ass bitch.

02:28.582 --> 02:31.252
Oh, you guys.
I have a serious problem.

02:31.319 --> 02:34.121
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
easy on the volume, bro.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.990
I totally tied one off
last night.

02:37.057 --> 02:38.992
Whew!

02:39.059 --> 02:41.161
Okay, look.
After that party,

02:41.229 --> 02:44.898
I did something
real stupid dumb.
JULIE: Oh, girl...

02:44.965 --> 02:48.269
We all does cray d's
when we're gettin' krunk.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.603
It's all good.

02:51.138 --> 02:53.541
That's got to stop
right now.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.277
Okay,
so what happened?
Yeah, what did you do?

02:56.344 --> 02:57.578
It's not what I did.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.351
Permission
to come aboard...

03:03.417 --> 03:04.452
Again?

03:07.120 --> 03:08.556
(SCREAMS)

03:24.638 --> 03:26.073
Say something.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.409
Eww?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.378
Not that!

03:30.444 --> 03:32.179
You slept with Pat?
(SCOFFS)

03:32.246 --> 03:33.481
Our boss, Pat?

03:33.547 --> 03:35.416
Shh!
Don't say it so loud!

03:35.483 --> 03:37.050
What?
You and Pat?

03:40.521 --> 03:42.055
Man, did I pick
the right day

03:42.122 --> 03:44.625
to come in late
wearing quiet footwear.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.126
Oh, God.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.929
Oh, Damona and Pat!
Whoo!

03:51.932 --> 03:54.935
I can't believe
I'm gonna ask this,
but was it...

03:55.936 --> 03:57.070
Okay?

03:59.607 --> 04:01.275
Child, please.
When I'm driving
the train,

04:01.342 --> 04:02.943
it always gets
to the station.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.413
To the station!
(LAUGHS)

04:07.748 --> 04:08.949
Here's the thing.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.784
I don't like him
like that,

04:10.851 --> 04:12.886
but I think it meant
more to him
than it did to me.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.589
Wait,
is the station an...

04:15.656 --> 04:16.857
Oh.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.693
To the station!
(LAUGHS)

04:20.561 --> 04:22.029
(IMITATES TRAIN CHUGGING)

04:23.731 --> 04:25.265
Choo! Choo!

04:28.302 --> 04:30.203
(SIGHS)

04:30.270 --> 04:32.873
Okay, look, he told me
I'm the first woman he's been
with since his wife left him,

04:32.940 --> 04:35.843
and I could tell
last night was kind of
filling a void for him.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.045
Oh, my God,
I have so many

04:38.111 --> 04:39.480
"filling the void" jokes
in my head right now.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.716
Really?
I don't have any.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.151
You guys!

04:44.217 --> 04:45.319
Help me!

04:45.386 --> 04:46.854
Okay, okay. You just...
You just, just...

04:46.920 --> 04:48.622
Got to get out
in front of it, you know?

04:48.689 --> 04:50.458
Just tell Pat
that this was just
a one-time thing.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.894
Ugh, that's gonna be
so awkward.
He's my boss!

04:53.961 --> 04:55.663
You're right.
Just quit, girl.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.866
Okay, fine.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.702
I'll just tell him
it was a small mistake.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.071
Three small mistakes,
about 20 minutes apart.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.238
Eww!

05:05.305 --> 05:07.074
Stop saying "eww".

05:07.140 --> 05:09.276
Ooh!
Stop saying, "ooh!"

05:09.343 --> 05:10.911
(LAUGHS)

05:10.978 --> 05:12.212
To the station!

05:20.954 --> 05:23.156
Whoa. What's with that
cozy blaze?

05:23.223 --> 05:25.859
Oh, your dad
fixed the fireplace.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.795
It turns out having
a retired engineer
around the house

05:27.861 --> 05:29.096
is pretty helpful.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.098
And to think,
you're the one
who wanted him

05:31.164 --> 05:34.201
out in the street
with paper bags
for shoes.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.505
Ah, yes,
my exact words.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.339
But I'm glad you talked
some sense into me,

05:39.407 --> 05:41.274
because he also
re-caulked the
kids' bathtub,

05:41.341 --> 05:42.910
and he fixed
the ice maker.
Why?

05:42.976 --> 05:45.613
'Cause it didn't
make ice.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.416
Well, sounds like Dad
got ahold of my to-do list.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.518
Yeah, we dug it out
of the family archives.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.686
Mmm, mmm,
ooh, good one.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.988
The first thing on it was
"assemble Molly's crib."

05:55.556 --> 05:57.124
Ha-ha.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.827
I'm digging
your stand-up routine
about how I don't do stuff.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.595
Look, I'm a very
busy man, Al,

06:01.662 --> 06:05.599
but it just so happens
I plan on doing a lot
of those things this week.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.701
Oh, good.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.269
So, you're gonna go back
and hang those curtains
in our old house?

06:09.336 --> 06:12.406
Oh, keep them coming, Al.
Comedy gold.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.775
Whoo! Whoo!

06:14.842 --> 06:17.144
Whoo!
What are you doing?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.979
D.K.: Organizing
junk drawer.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.914
Why is there picture
of me and your
mother in here?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.450
We gave you as gift!

06:22.516 --> 06:23.884
Oh, there it is.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.419
I've been looking
all over for it.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.387
Yeah, why'd you stick it
in there, Allison?

06:28.956 --> 06:30.390
Okay, I'll see
you guys later.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.525
DR. KEN:
Where are you going?

06:31.592 --> 06:33.326
To Sadie's house
to watch Mockingjay.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.695
On a school night?

06:34.762 --> 06:36.329
(DISHWASHER WHIRRING LOUDLY)
I said it was okay

06:36.396 --> 06:38.365
if it had
a strong female lead!

06:38.432 --> 06:40.033
What's wrong
with dishwasher?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.368
It's old!

06:41.435 --> 06:43.904
Why can't I
watch a movie
on a school night?

06:43.971 --> 06:45.205
Because you're 10!

06:45.272 --> 06:46.440
I'm 11!

06:46.507 --> 06:49.109
You know what I mean!

06:49.176 --> 06:51.512
This dishwasher
so loud.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.180
Eh, the rinse cycle's
a little wonky.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.281
We're used to it.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.083
It's the soundtrack
of my youth.

06:57.818 --> 06:58.852
You need new one.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.622
Yeah, I know.
It's on my
to-do list, okay?

07:01.689 --> 07:03.624
Allison told me
about your to-do list.

07:03.691 --> 07:04.792
You write fiction?

07:04.858 --> 07:06.960
(ALL LAUGH)

07:07.027 --> 07:09.630
Oh, so, I guess
you were the opening act
for him, huh?

07:09.697 --> 07:11.398
Anyone else
going up tonight?

07:12.566 --> 07:13.734
So what time
will you be home?

07:14.367 --> 07:15.803
Mol?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.004
Your mom's
talking to you.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.840
Put down phone.
It's rude.

07:19.907 --> 07:22.776
Oh, sorry.
I didn't realize
I was doing that.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.077
When will you be home?

07:24.144 --> 07:25.345
I don't know.
11:00?

07:25.412 --> 07:27.781
No. School night.
You be home by 10:00.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.417
Okay, Dad. We got this.
Her curfew's 11:00.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.752
Last night,
she stayed up late.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.787
This morning,
she was very tired.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.756
You know,
I was dragging today.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.825
See?
Listen to your body.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.860
Nature's curfew.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.295
Okay.
Thanks, Grandpa.
See you at 10:00.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.500
Can you believe that?

07:46.567 --> 07:48.769
I know!
He even fixed Molly!

07:57.578 --> 07:59.947
Hey. How'd your talk
go with Pat yesterday?

08:00.013 --> 08:01.414
It didn't.
He never came in.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.851
And he didn't call
or text?
Nope.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.287
Oh, sorry.
Force of habit.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.323
I haven't heard
from him at all.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.458
Maybe you're off
the hook.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.660
I hope so.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.062
The last thing I want
is an awkward conversation.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.196
Listen up, people.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.266
I have an announcement
to make

08:19.332 --> 08:22.536
about an exciting
development in my
personal life.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.572
Oh. Please.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.406
Please, no.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.308
We all know
how rumors spread
around the office...

08:28.375 --> 08:32.145
And that's why
nobody should talk
about anything to anybody.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.781
Back to work, people.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.150
Damona...
I want do this.

08:37.217 --> 08:41.722
I want to get out ahead
of the gossip mill
and let you all know

08:41.789 --> 08:43.991
that I will be
getting back together

08:44.057 --> 08:45.192
with my ex-wife,
Tiffany.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.261
That's right.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.397
We're in the process
of mending fences...

08:50.463 --> 08:51.732
Like the one
in her front yard

08:51.799 --> 08:53.901
that I drove through
in a rage last month.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.604
But seriously,

08:56.670 --> 08:59.372
I'd like to thank you all
for your unspoken
congratulations.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.211
Well, hey!
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

09:04.277 --> 09:05.478
Lucky you.
You get to skip

09:05.545 --> 09:07.681
that awkward conversation
after all.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.717
Yeah, it looks like
that night with you

09:09.783 --> 09:11.885
meant absolutely
nothing to him.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.187
You must be
so relieved.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.023
Oh, I am so relieved!

09:16.690 --> 09:17.858
(ALL CHUCKLE)

09:17.925 --> 09:20.027
Great, 'cause it just
meant nothing.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.329
I mean,
less than nothing.
Like, nothing.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.598
Damona...
Oh.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.566
I feel I owe you
an explanation.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.501
Oh, no. You don't
owe me a thing

09:28.568 --> 09:31.338
except maybe,
at some point, my bra.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.974
Ah, already in the mail.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.209
Book rate,
should arrive in eight
to 10 business days.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.379
But I want
to thank you.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.181
For what?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.316
Well, helping me
to put things
into perspective.

09:43.383 --> 09:46.019
Hmm.
I mean, sure.
We had fun.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.755
Raw, animalistic...

09:49.522 --> 09:51.058
Boundary-pushing fun.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.528
But it was empty.

09:55.595 --> 09:59.132
I mean, it was devoid
of any real romance
or feeling.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.468
Uh-huh.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.338
But if it
wasn't for you

10:05.405 --> 10:07.474
and that
hollow experience

10:07.540 --> 10:09.810
that we stumbled
upon together...
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

10:09.877 --> 10:11.378
...I might never
have appreciated

10:11.444 --> 10:13.046
the depth
of what I have
with Tiffany.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.481
(SMACKS LIPS)

10:14.547 --> 10:16.249
Glad I could help.
Aw.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.952
Oh, and I wanted you
to have this.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.587
Oh.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.690
(CHUCKLES)
What is this?

10:22.756 --> 10:25.292
That's the tracking number
for your brassiere.

10:31.398 --> 10:35.535
Guess which baller
hit a fancy appliance store
on his way home from work

10:35.602 --> 10:37.637
and walked out
with a floor model.

10:37.705 --> 10:40.340
Holla!

10:40.407 --> 10:43.310
Actually,
you don't have to holler.
The baller was me.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.412
A floor model dishwasher?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.715
Yeah, it's just got
a tiny scratch
on the door.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.316
You really have
to look for it, though.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.550
Found it.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.552
Oh, here's another.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.321
Okay, the point is,

10:54.387 --> 10:57.024
I'm pretty good
at taking care
of my nest, yo.

10:57.090 --> 11:00.193
Your dad bought us
a dishwasher
this afternoon, yo.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.064
European, new.
In box.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.667
Oh, no dings.

11:07.735 --> 11:10.037
Remember our frosted
drinking glasses?

11:10.103 --> 11:12.405
Turns out
they were just dirty.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.241
And grandpa
installed it himself.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.078
(SIGHS)
No bigs, you know.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.813
I was gonna install
this one myself.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.050
According to this,
you paid an extra $200
for me to install it.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.252
Well, that, that's
obviously a typo.

11:25.318 --> 11:28.856
Well, you signed it
and initialed it
in four places, so I...

11:28.922 --> 11:33.193
Okay, thank you,
delivery guy/memory expert.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.662
Now, can you start
uninstalling this one,
please?

11:35.729 --> 11:38.098
Ken, are you crazy?
We're not taking
this one out.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.033
It has
smart washing technology!

11:40.100 --> 11:41.468
And Wi-Fi.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.070
You can turn it on
from your car.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.637
Which mom just
let me do.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.540
Wait, wait, wait.
It's on?

11:47.607 --> 11:49.642
Yeah, it's super quiet.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.946
It's like our dishes
are being licked clean
by angels.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.584
Beautifully put.
I'd keep that one.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.119
That thing's cherry.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.687
Fine. You know what?

12:00.754 --> 12:02.189
Take your
stupid dishwasher

12:02.255 --> 12:03.323
and your clipboard
of lies

12:03.390 --> 12:04.925
and go back
to Appliance World,
okay, pal?

12:04.992 --> 12:06.760
You can't return
floor models,

12:06.827 --> 12:08.395
so I'll just leave it
in your driveway.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.097
No, it's gonna get
all dinged up.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.666
Don't worry, Dad.
A few more won't make
a difference.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.769
Look,
there's another one.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.771
Oh, and Maytag
Is spelled wrong.

12:21.875 --> 12:22.976
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

12:24.011 --> 12:25.278
Hey. Um...

12:26.847 --> 12:29.049
I kind of think
we should talk

12:29.116 --> 12:31.051
about what happened
between us.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.353
Oh, good.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.088
Yeah, it's been
on my mind, too.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.624
Please.
Oh.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.528
Damona...

12:42.562 --> 12:44.898
I'm sorry
I mailed your bra
book rate.

12:47.567 --> 12:50.170
Wait. Are we talking
about my bra?

12:50.637 --> 12:52.139
No.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.441
No, we're talking
about my behavior,

12:54.507 --> 12:57.410
which was unacceptable.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.412
But I realized
there was something
behind it.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.282
Oh. Mmm-kay.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.852
It's just...

13:06.286 --> 13:08.956
I've been
burned before.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.224
I mean, priority mail
costs twice as much,

13:11.291 --> 13:13.827
and sometimes
the difference is
only like a day.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.497
Are you serious
right now?

13:17.564 --> 13:19.732
Yeah, and express mail,
well, that's a total sham.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.135
Don't even get me st...
Okay, okay, okay!

13:22.202 --> 13:24.704
Will you stop it
with the postal rates?

13:24.771 --> 13:27.841
Well...
You are acting like
nothing happened between us.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.709
(CHUCKLES)

13:29.776 --> 13:31.644
I'm sexy.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.580
Men don't sleep
with me

13:33.646 --> 13:35.682
and then go running back
to their ex-wives.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.885
They come back
wanting more.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.119
Well, I'm sorry
if your feelings
were hurt...

13:39.186 --> 13:41.889
I don't get
my feelings hurt.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.091
I hurt feelings.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.660
Your boat
smells like cheese!

13:51.899 --> 13:53.666
Hey, what's going on?

13:53.733 --> 13:55.969
I helped Grandpa
replace the
broken shingles

13:56.036 --> 13:57.604
before El Nino comes.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.172
I thought
you were afraid
of climbing ladders.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.341
I thought I was, too,
but Grandpa
said I wasn't.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.642
You're not.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.244
See? I'm not!

14:06.179 --> 14:07.480
I told you
that you weren't.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.682
Yeah, but Grandpa's
more believable.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.956
And look!
He even gave me
my own tool belt.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.291
Time to make him
a man.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.260
Somebody's got
to do it, huh?

14:20.327 --> 14:21.962
(BOTH LAUGH)

14:22.029 --> 14:23.796
I know it's time
to make him a man.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.832
I have a reminder
on my phone.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.538
(IMITATING D.K.)
Time to make him a man.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.140
Somebody's got to do it.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.474
(LAUGHS)

14:39.812 --> 14:41.514
Ooh, Wi-Fi.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.583
You can turn it on
from the car.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.018
Ooh, yes.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.001
(DISHWASHER POWERS DOWN)

15:02.502 --> 15:04.904
Let's see you start it
from the car now.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.875
(CHUCKLING)

15:12.412 --> 15:13.846
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

15:22.122 --> 15:24.191
Dad, Grandpa just sold
the driveway dishwasher

15:24.257 --> 15:26.793
for a hundred bucks
more than you paid for it.

15:26.859 --> 15:29.896
And that's what you call
a Park negotiation.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.198
Yeah, great technique.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.765
You just keep
glaring at them

15:32.832 --> 15:34.667
until they're
so uncomfortable,
they cave.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.403
It worked on your mother.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.238
Proposal took 17 minutes.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.345
(SOFTLY)
Okay, please stop.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.347
(CELLPHONE CHIMES)

15:47.414 --> 15:51.151
Huh? I just got a text
from the dishwasher.
(CELLPHONE CHIMES)

15:51.218 --> 15:55.188
Me too.
There's some
kind of error.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.357
Well, you know
what they say about
European appliances.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.758
That they're the best
in the world?

15:58.825 --> 16:00.460
They raise the value
of your home?

16:00.527 --> 16:02.629
They combine elegance
and efficiency?

16:03.863 --> 16:05.498
Hmm.
Makes no sense.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.367
Should work.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.669
Well, it doesn't.
So much for the value
of our home.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.406
I'm gonna text its friends,
see if they know anything.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.344
Anyone have contact info
for the wine fridge?

16:17.410 --> 16:18.678
That's not
how it works, honey.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.447
You're right.
I'll just call it.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.051
It's ringing.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.594
Well, your father pulled
the entire dishwasher
out from the wall,

16:34.661 --> 16:36.463
and he's re-checking
every wire and hose.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.531
Boy, what is it with him
and that thing?

16:38.598 --> 16:40.633
He's like the Moby Dick
of dishwashers.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.637
Or maybe the dishwasher
is Moby Dick?

16:44.704 --> 16:46.373
I'll be honest,
never read it.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.241
Not a huge
Michael Crichton guy.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.079
Okay.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.846
What's going on with you?

16:53.913 --> 16:55.715
Nothing.
Really?

16:55.782 --> 16:57.950
I was the one
who was so against
your father's visit,

16:58.017 --> 17:00.253
but everything he's done
since he got here
has upset you.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.255
I don't have any issues
with my dad, okay?

17:02.322 --> 17:04.657
What the hell is this?

17:04.724 --> 17:06.226
You broke dishwasher
on purpose?

17:06.293 --> 17:08.728
Oh, look, an issue.
I'll be upstairs.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.599
Oh.
Where'd you find that?

17:12.665 --> 17:15.502
You know where.
In junk drawer
I organized!

17:16.836 --> 17:18.071
I went looking
for a wrench

17:18.138 --> 17:19.872
and I find lies!

17:21.808 --> 17:23.076
What's wrong with you?

17:23.143 --> 17:25.545
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

17:25.612 --> 17:27.180
Look, ever since
you got here,
all you've done is

17:27.247 --> 17:28.381
fix everything!

17:28.448 --> 17:29.816
So? What's wrong
with that?

17:29.882 --> 17:31.418
You made me look bad
in front of my family!

17:31.484 --> 17:32.885
It's like you think
I'm not man enough

17:32.952 --> 17:35.222
to take care of things
on my own.
It's like I'm soft.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.057
Oh, yeah. You're soft.
You're soft
like marshmallow.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.993
Aha! So you're not
gonna deny it.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.796
You're so soft,
if I ever fall out
of building,

17:43.863 --> 17:45.198
I hope I land on you.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.435
Okay.
Kind of doubling down.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.138
Ken...

17:51.204 --> 17:53.240
I had to learn
how to fix things

17:53.306 --> 17:55.242
because we had
no money.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.410
But you,
you're a doctor.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.878
(SCOFFS) Oh.
Much better.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.079
Because I have money?

18:00.147 --> 18:03.082
No. Because
you fix people.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.618
Much better
than fixing dishwasher

18:05.685 --> 18:08.221
or bathtub
or roof tiles

18:08.288 --> 18:10.056
or ceiling fan or...

18:10.123 --> 18:12.892
Okay, can we get back
to how I'm better
than you?

18:12.959 --> 18:15.495
I didn't mean
to make you feel bad.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.865
But you're a
very important,
busy man.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.867
I'm trying to do
what I could
to help you.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.037
I'm proud of you, son.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.343
Thanks, Dad.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.813
Should we hug?

18:33.880 --> 18:34.947
Nah.

18:36.583 --> 18:37.784
We hugged
at Thanksgiving.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.085
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.289
Hey, where are you going?
To fix dishwasher.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.556
Oh, come on, Dad.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.958
I took it off.
I'll put it back on.

18:46.025 --> 18:48.861
So what do you think?
Super glue or duct tape?

18:48.928 --> 18:50.363
Hand it over,
cotton ball.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.698
(CHUCKLES)

18:53.065 --> 18:54.501
Oh, also,
if you have a minute,

18:54.567 --> 18:57.404
the vacuum's blowing out,
not in, so...

18:57.470 --> 18:58.971
I'll look at it.
(CHUCKLES)

19:01.574 --> 19:04.244
Ah...
Dishwasher, vacuum.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.879
(CHUCKLING)
Man, I am really
getting stuff done.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.694
Damona.

19:23.863 --> 19:27.400
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said
today in my office,

19:27.467 --> 19:30.102
and, uh,
I, I just want you
to know that, uh...

19:31.771 --> 19:34.341
What happened
between us...

19:34.407 --> 19:36.008
You know,
the sex stuff...

19:37.677 --> 19:41.781
Well, not only
was it great, but it...

19:41.848 --> 19:43.516
It did mean
something to me.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.152
But you said...
I know I...

19:46.219 --> 19:48.821
That was just because
I didn't think you cared.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.691
But what you
showed me today
is that you do.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.960
Well, I was, you know,
just being emotional,

19:54.026 --> 19:56.062
'cause you know
how I get about
postal rates.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.163
Oh, yeah.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.401
And you should
probably also know

20:01.468 --> 20:05.137
that when I announced
that I was getting back
together with my ex-wife,

20:05.204 --> 20:07.274
I may have spoken
a little too soon.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.808
How much too soon?

20:08.875 --> 20:10.577
Before I actually
spoke to her.

20:12.245 --> 20:16.283
Yeah, seems she does
not share my enthusiasm
for the idea.

20:16.349 --> 20:20.019
Or for old-fashioned
serenades in her
place of work.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.288
(CHUCKLES)

20:21.354 --> 20:22.955
I guess
air-traffic controllers

20:23.022 --> 20:24.857
have to
"stay focused."

20:25.558 --> 20:26.926
(LAUGHS)

20:28.261 --> 20:31.964
So I'm back on the boat
in every sense.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.735
Meaning, the gangplank
is extended.

20:37.103 --> 20:38.405
The mast is up.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.006
I get the metaphor.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.274
Ah.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.177
Anyway, I'm sorry
to hear about your wife.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.414
Ah, well, thank you.
Thanks.

20:48.214 --> 20:49.716
(BOTH CLEAR THROATS)

20:57.089 --> 20:58.725
(SCOFFS) So, I hurt
your feelings, huh?

20:58.791 --> 21:00.593
(SCOFFS)
I didn't say all that.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.929
(CHUCKLES) No, no.
Ah, totally, totally.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.897
Yeah, yeah.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.366
So, uh...

21:07.066 --> 21:08.535
Feel like maybe...

21:10.069 --> 21:11.338
Grabbing some dinner?

21:13.239 --> 21:14.841
Sure. Let's go.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.108
BOTH: Okay.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.010
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

21:18.077 --> 21:19.412
Hey, now,
just to be clear,

21:19.479 --> 21:21.147
when I say
"grab some dinner," I meant
go back to my boat...

21:21.213 --> 21:22.549
It's clear.
Oh, okay.
