WEBVTT

00:09.418 --> 00:10.353
- Mommy!
- Yeah?

00:10.921 --> 00:12.356
- Guess what?
- What?

00:12.423 --> 00:13.858
Miss Mornie gave me a green ticket.

00:13.926 --> 00:15.461
I got to go to the prize box.

00:15.528 --> 00:17.531
Prize box? That's fantastic, Sophie.

00:17.598 --> 00:19.032
You know what I think?

00:19.100 --> 00:21.604
I think that daddy would
like to hear about this.

00:25.278 --> 00:27.514
Hey. It's Hardy. I'm
approaching the third floor.

00:27.582 --> 00:29.517
What unit was that disturbance call?

00:29.584 --> 00:30.852
Unknown.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.354
Somewhere on floor 3.

00:34.191 --> 00:36.694
Roger that. I'll find it.

00:36.762 --> 00:38.029
Hey, Jimmy, you know what?

00:38.097 --> 00:39.531
I was supposed to be punched
out about 40 minutes ago.

00:39.599 --> 00:40.700
Sorry, bro.

00:40.767 --> 00:42.034
You caught the call.

00:48.077 --> 00:49.345
Hey!

00:49.413 --> 00:51.047
What the hell you...

00:56.654 --> 00:59.725
Hey, this is Nick. You know
what to do after the beep.

01:00.694 --> 01:04.162
It's me. Um, guessing

01:04.230 --> 01:06.629
you're not going to make
it home for dinner again.

01:06.697 --> 01:08.865
Sophie really needs her father.

01:08.933 --> 01:11.702
When you get home, we
need to talk about this

01:11.770 --> 01:13.905
because something has to change.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074

01:39.099 --> 01:41.601
12.50 a share.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.169
It's the best I can do.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.605
If I'm going to pull the trigger,

01:44.672 --> 01:47.141
it has to be at the right price, Don.

01:49.444 --> 01:51.345
You know, something tells
me you can do a lot better.

01:51.413 --> 01:53.481
I can't do better.

02:01.625 --> 02:03.759
Well...

02:03.827 --> 02:06.062
I guess we're done here.

02:09.501 --> 02:11.902
You walk out of here now,
don, and the deal's off.

02:11.970 --> 02:15.705
Are you sure there's no
more money on the table?

02:18.576 --> 02:22.279
Fine. $13. Not a penny more.

02:22.347 --> 02:24.582
My absolute limit.

02:28.254 --> 02:30.288
Great. We have a deal.

02:30.356 --> 02:31.890
You drive a hard bargain.

02:31.958 --> 02:34.226
And you have a private jet. Seems fair.

02:41.533 --> 02:43.134
Not bad. I pay you 10 grand,

02:43.201 --> 02:44.669
and you make me 15 million.

02:44.737 --> 02:46.204
Teach me.

02:46.271 --> 02:48.172
The science, I mean.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.507
Well, you got 8 years, have you?

02:49.575 --> 02:50.942
I want to shadow you. I
want to watch what you do.

02:51.010 --> 02:53.111
How you do it. I'm a quick study.

02:53.179 --> 02:55.013
I'll pay you 30 grand for the week.

02:55.081 --> 02:58.517
50.

02:58.584 --> 03:01.920
Yeah?

03:01.988 --> 03:03.689
Right. Get Loker down there with a camera.

03:03.756 --> 03:05.290
40.

03:05.358 --> 03:06.625
Oh, a cop's been shot.

03:06.693 --> 03:08.660
I'm on retainer with the city.

03:10.063 --> 03:12.997
45. Take it or leave it.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.867
So why's the FBI on this?

03:16.935 --> 03:18.701
Well, there was a shooting
on a federal housing project.

03:18.769 --> 03:21.536
Ah, there he is. Captain
James, D.C. police.

03:21.604 --> 03:24.306
Dr. Cal Lightman. Given
our present situation,

03:24.373 --> 03:25.640
Lightman's the man.

03:25.708 --> 03:27.042
What's the situation?

03:27.109 --> 03:30.244
One of the bullets rendered
Officer Nick Hardy a quadriplegic.

03:30.312 --> 03:31.779
He can't speak, can't move,

03:31.847 --> 03:33.447
and we can't get a clear response

03:33.515 --> 03:35.115
to any of our questions.

03:35.183 --> 03:37.617
So you want me to help
identify the shooters.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.951
Yes.

03:39.019 --> 03:42.454
911 got a call from the Eastmont Projects.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.056
Tenants heard shots,

03:44.124 --> 03:47.125
and they saw 2 kids running from
the building in bloody shirts.

03:47.193 --> 03:48.793
Now, they were caught a few blocks away,

03:48.860 --> 03:50.961
but no shirts and no murder weapon.

03:51.029 --> 03:53.463
But residue on one of their hands shows

03:53.531 --> 03:55.031
that he recently fired a gun.

03:55.099 --> 03:57.899
But without the weapon, we
can't prove it was the gun.

03:57.967 --> 04:00.634
Yeah. And the surgeon says that
Hardy doesn't even have much time...

04:00.702 --> 04:03.406
maybe a few days, but more
than likely, a few hours.

04:03.473 --> 04:05.609
Why are you so worried now?

04:05.677 --> 04:06.943
That's one of my men in there.

04:07.011 --> 04:08.912
You're concerned you don't
have the whole story yet.

04:08.980 --> 04:10.146
Look, the kids that we picked up,

04:10.214 --> 04:12.415
they're just runners
for a small-time dealer.

04:12.482 --> 04:13.916
They never carried weapons,

04:13.984 --> 04:16.084
and they have no history of violent crime.

04:16.152 --> 04:17.586
And then, one day, they just shoot a cop.

04:17.653 --> 04:20.821
No, no. See, I think
someone told them to gun up.

04:20.889 --> 04:22.456
But the question for you is,

04:22.523 --> 04:26.292
can you read a man who
can barely move his eyes?

05:04.359 --> 05:06.560
Mrs. Hardy?

05:06.628 --> 05:08.328
I'm Cal Lightman.

05:09.831 --> 05:11.597
You Sophie?

05:11.665 --> 05:13.332
How you doing, Sophie?

05:16.670 --> 05:18.037
These are my colleagues.

05:18.105 --> 05:20.006
They told me you'd come.

05:23.710 --> 05:25.644
Um, Mrs. Hardy, maybe I can
take you and your daughter

05:25.712 --> 05:28.547
to get something to
drink in the cafeteria.

05:34.119 --> 05:37.754
I love you. We'll be right back.

05:39.424 --> 05:41.191
Ah, he liked that.

05:41.259 --> 05:43.359
Look at the muscles around the eyes.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.795
They contracted a bit.

05:46.863 --> 05:48.697
It made him happier.

05:56.171 --> 05:57.504
While you're at it, Clara,

05:57.572 --> 05:59.406
try and get ahold of Foster.

06:12.184 --> 06:14.819
Come on.

06:14.887 --> 06:18.355
Nick, I'm here to help find
out who did this to you.

06:18.423 --> 06:19.757
I know you can't answer questions

06:19.824 --> 06:21.191
the way you normally would,

06:21.259 --> 06:26.529
but you just think it, and
I'll try to do the rest, ok?

06:26.596 --> 06:28.030
I want to state for the record

06:28.098 --> 06:30.232
that this show-up is beyond unorthodox.

06:30.299 --> 06:32.967
Shut up, counselor.

06:33.035 --> 06:34.302
You getting something?

06:36.271 --> 06:39.040
All right, Nick. Are you 90 years old?

06:40.843 --> 06:44.245
Are you 30 years old?

06:48.483 --> 06:50.217
There.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.552
Right there.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.320
His pupils.

06:54.421 --> 06:56.289
Can you bring those two over?

06:57.891 --> 06:59.725
And lean them right in.

07:01.427 --> 07:04.596
I know you're tired, but I need
you to concentrate, all right?

07:04.663 --> 07:08.599
Were these two boys
there when you were shot?

07:10.300 --> 07:11.533
It's a positive affirmation.

07:11.601 --> 07:13.401
That's a "yes" to you, counselor.

07:13.469 --> 07:15.970
All right. One at a time.

07:18.374 --> 07:20.542
Did this one shoot you?

07:23.612 --> 07:26.046
Nothing? Ok.

07:26.114 --> 07:28.382
And the other?

07:28.450 --> 07:31.552
In he comes now.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.987
Did this one shoot you?

07:36.457 --> 07:37.891
There it is.

07:39.359 --> 07:42.257
Right. Well, they were
both there when he was shot,

07:42.324 --> 07:44.658
but this one, he pulled the trigger.

07:44.726 --> 07:46.760
What's your next trick,
reading tea leaves?

07:46.828 --> 07:48.194
This is all total garbage.

07:48.262 --> 07:49.896
I'm giving my clients
back to social services

07:49.964 --> 07:50.997
and taking them back to county.

07:51.064 --> 07:53.265
No, you're not.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.867
We know you were working with someone.

07:55.935 --> 07:57.635
If you fess up now,

07:57.703 --> 07:59.504
we can protect you from that person.

07:59.571 --> 08:02.673
Look at that... honest fear, it is.

08:02.741 --> 08:04.675
Do not say anything. There
are no questions here.

08:04.743 --> 08:06.510
My clients have a right
against self-incrimination.

08:06.577 --> 08:09.345
They also have a right
to self-preservation.

08:09.413 --> 08:12.014
They cooperate, maybe we can cut a deal,

08:12.082 --> 08:15.550
because we are going to find
who you were working for.

08:15.618 --> 08:16.818
We were doing a job for...

08:16.886 --> 08:18.786
I told you, you don't
have to say anything.

08:18.854 --> 08:20.454
We were slanging drugs for Tevon,

08:20.522 --> 08:21.855
and suddenly, this cop creeped up on us.

08:21.923 --> 08:23.824
In our neighborhood,

08:23.892 --> 08:26.760
someone comes up behind you,

08:26.827 --> 08:29.028
you don't ask questions. You shoot.

08:31.265 --> 08:34.433
Went down before we even
knew he was the police.

08:36.269 --> 08:37.702
He's lying.

08:37.770 --> 08:39.904
Clara, how do I know he's lying?

08:39.972 --> 08:41.773
For 45 grand, why don't you tell me?

08:41.840 --> 08:44.107
Ok. Um, here we go.

08:45.343 --> 08:47.677
Went down before we even
knew he was the police.

08:47.745 --> 08:49.846
There.

08:49.913 --> 08:51.280
Duping-delight.

08:51.348 --> 08:53.449
Some people can't help just
the tiniest hint of a smile

08:53.517 --> 08:55.050
when they think they've
gotten away with a lie.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.986
Who's Tevon? Their
language is all past tense.

08:58.054 --> 09:00.722
It's like they're unconsciously
cutting ties from this person.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.391
Tevon's the dealer they clocked for.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.726
He runs the projects. Real scumbag.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.128
Yeah, well, may have been
running drugs for him,

09:06.195 --> 09:07.529
but that's not who they were working for

09:07.596 --> 09:08.630
when they bumped into Hardy.

09:08.697 --> 09:10.698
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

09:10.766 --> 09:12.033
Sure as the lie on his face.

09:12.101 --> 09:13.535
So whoever they were really working for

09:13.602 --> 09:14.869
scares them enough that

09:14.937 --> 09:16.137
they would rather serve up Tevon.

09:16.205 --> 09:17.637
Or maybe there's a rival dealer

09:17.705 --> 09:20.004
trying to recruit some of Tevon's runners.

09:20.072 --> 09:21.370
We should go talk to him.

09:21.438 --> 09:22.972
I already told you, that's
not who they were working for.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.339
So why do you want to go and see him?

09:24.407 --> 09:26.541
Well, the first rule of
policeman, Dr. Lightman...

09:26.609 --> 09:28.043
Um, stop for coffee?

09:28.110 --> 09:30.845
Follow every lead.

09:30.913 --> 09:33.514
- Hey, Emily.
- Hey.

09:33.582 --> 09:37.317
Cal, we need to talk. Maybe alone.

09:37.385 --> 09:39.219
- Uh-oh.
- I'll just go get a snack

09:39.286 --> 09:40.720
while you two talk about Clara.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.521
Oh, good grief. Sit down.

09:42.589 --> 09:44.323
What about Clara?

09:44.391 --> 09:46.291
Our accountant says we
can't make payroll next week.

09:46.359 --> 09:47.959
Terrific. Start the layoffs, then.

09:48.027 --> 09:49.127
The situation is serious.

09:49.195 --> 09:50.795
And keeping your daughter here as buffer

09:50.863 --> 09:52.296
is not going to keep me from
yelling until I get through to you.

09:52.364 --> 09:53.798
All right, calm down.

09:53.865 --> 09:56.333
What about Clara...
formally, Mrs. Bailout?

09:56.401 --> 10:00.070
Maybe she's more valuable
than just a one-day ridealong.

10:00.137 --> 10:01.504
Let me get this straight.

10:01.572 --> 10:05.774
You're asking me to ask Clara for a loan?

10:05.842 --> 10:07.109
She could know people...

10:07.176 --> 10:08.843
people with money who
could use our services...

10:08.911 --> 10:10.778
She's our client, Gillian. I
don't ask clients for loans.

10:10.846 --> 10:12.246
And I don't mix business with pleasure.

10:12.314 --> 10:13.747
Pleasure?

10:14.649 --> 10:16.917
Hi.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.319
If you want to discuss
some kind of business deal,

10:19.387 --> 10:20.453
I'm open to it.

10:20.521 --> 10:21.621
Well, that's much appreciated,

10:21.688 --> 10:24.790
but, you know, your money's no good here.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.960
This would probably be a bad time to ask

10:28.027 --> 10:30.395
for the $300 I need for the dance.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.730
Since when does it cost $300 to dance?

10:32.798 --> 10:35.132
I need a new dress, shoes...

10:35.200 --> 10:37.067
Hair, manicure.

10:37.135 --> 10:40.036
Well, clearly outnumbered here.

10:42.372 --> 10:43.939
There you are.

10:44.007 --> 10:45.874
- Thank you.
- I want receipts.

10:47.877 --> 10:49.477
I just keep coming to
you with this problem,

10:49.544 --> 10:50.811
and you keep ignoring it.

10:50.879 --> 10:52.545
Well, find a loan, then.

10:52.613 --> 10:54.881
- I know some money men.
- I could help you with this.

10:54.949 --> 10:56.082
Ready?

10:56.150 --> 10:57.483
Yes.

11:02.522 --> 11:04.756
Whoa. You don't think
you're coming along, do you?

11:04.824 --> 11:05.790
Absolutely.

11:05.858 --> 11:06.958
No, she's my colleague.

11:07.026 --> 11:08.893
Wherever I go, she goes.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.929
Fine, but she's signing a waiver.

11:10.996 --> 11:12.830
- Ok.
- No, I tell you what,

11:12.898 --> 11:14.064
why don't you go with Foster

11:14.132 --> 11:15.165
and sign the necessary papers?

11:15.233 --> 11:16.566
While you're at it, you can give her

11:16.634 --> 11:17.834
the names of those money men.

11:17.901 --> 11:20.703
Glad to help. To the right.

11:20.770 --> 11:22.771
Let's go before she comes back now.

11:26.041 --> 11:27.307
Tevon moves around the projects

11:27.375 --> 11:28.809
every few months.

11:28.876 --> 11:31.911
Makes it harder for the
U.Cs to keep a bead on him.

11:31.978 --> 11:34.913
Our intel says he's on the fourth floor.

11:34.981 --> 11:37.482
Problem is, we don't know which apartment.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.492
We're the cops. Who wants
to be strip-searched?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.567
Well, there's your apartment.

11:52.635 --> 11:54.835
It's the first one down on the left.

11:54.903 --> 11:56.503
And how do you know that?

11:56.570 --> 11:58.271
If you put a drop of water
in front of a swarm of ants,

11:58.339 --> 12:00.006
you know, they'll avoid it
'cause they think it's dangerous.

12:00.073 --> 12:01.340
The kids did the same thing...

12:01.407 --> 12:02.541
they steered clear of that apartment.

12:02.608 --> 12:04.209
Probably for the same reason.

12:04.276 --> 12:06.144
All right.

12:06.211 --> 12:07.478
Whoa, no. No.

12:07.546 --> 12:09.980
You're a civilian, all right?
You stay in the stairwell.

12:10.048 --> 12:13.783
Well, can I have a badge and
a gun? Can you deputize me?

12:13.851 --> 12:16.119
Yeah, nice try. Listen,

12:16.186 --> 12:18.020
you get in any trouble, you call us.

12:18.088 --> 12:20.255
All right. Thank you very much.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.427
I walked this beat 20 years.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.761
Pretty tough, all right?

12:27.829 --> 12:29.229
Mm-hmm.

12:36.603 --> 12:37.703
Yeah?

12:37.771 --> 12:39.338
Police. Tevon in?

12:39.406 --> 12:41.273
No. Tevon ain't here.

12:41.341 --> 12:42.807
Well, I guess we're just going to
have to wait for him, then, huh?

12:42.875 --> 12:45.009
Yo, man, drop it!

12:45.077 --> 12:46.878
Hey, drop the gun. What
are you doing? We're cops.

12:46.946 --> 12:49.448
Man, I got shot by a guy
saying they was cops before.

12:49.515 --> 12:51.917
I ain't going for it then,
I ain't going for it now.

12:51.984 --> 12:56.120
So y'all drop the gun, or
I'm pulling the trigger.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.367
Son, you are playing this all wrong.

13:02.435 --> 13:03.902
No. What's wrong is y'all
creepin' round my door

13:04.170 --> 13:05.603
trying to cap me, man.

13:05.671 --> 13:06.871
Captain James, this is officer Lightman.

13:07.139 --> 13:08.239
We got S.W.A.T. outside.

13:08.306 --> 13:11.075
The sniper has the subject in
sight through the south window.

13:11.343 --> 13:13.944
Good. I hope they shoot your
ass in the back of the head.

13:14.011 --> 13:15.111
Shut up, bitch!

13:15.179 --> 13:16.346
Officer James, please respond.

13:16.413 --> 13:17.680
Do we greenlight the sniper?

13:17.747 --> 13:19.181
Let me tell you something.

13:19.448 --> 13:21.216
Those snipers are going to
put a bullet in your brain

13:21.284 --> 13:23.385
unless you drop that gun right now.

13:23.452 --> 13:26.087
You have 3 seconds. Put the gun down.

13:26.155 --> 13:27.588
Put it down.

13:28.156 --> 13:31.423
1, 2...

13:31.491 --> 13:33.458
All right, yo.

13:33.526 --> 13:35.192
Ain't knew y'all was really cops, man.

13:35.260 --> 13:37.094
Thought y'all was here
to mess with my business.

13:37.161 --> 13:38.628
All right. Cool, cool. Be.

13:38.696 --> 13:39.796
Put it down.

13:39.864 --> 13:42.632
Easy, man. Cool.

13:44.167 --> 13:46.802
Hey, man. Look. All this is
just one big honest mistake.

13:46.870 --> 13:47.903
- I know it was.
- All right. Cool.

13:47.971 --> 13:48.937
So was this. Hey!

13:49.005 --> 13:51.573
Hey! Hey, come on, man.

13:51.641 --> 13:52.573
Take a walk, honey.

13:53.642 --> 13:55.976
Hey! Hey, man!

13:56.044 --> 13:59.413
Man, this ain't justice, man.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.180
Hey, what this is about?

14:01.248 --> 14:03.348
Who's your deputy now, then?

14:04.951 --> 14:07.385
Yo, man, those kids are
straight-up liars, man.

14:07.453 --> 14:09.721
All I told them to do was run product,

14:09.788 --> 14:11.655
and by product, I mean chewing gum.

14:11.722 --> 14:14.890
He's telling the truth,
except for the gum part.

14:14.958 --> 14:16.891
See, man? Listen to him.

14:16.959 --> 14:18.625
What do you know about
the cop that got shot?

14:18.693 --> 14:21.294
I know Jack, man.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.596
Matter of fact, where my lawyer at?

14:24.664 --> 14:28.331
Where's your stash, Tevon?

14:28.398 --> 14:31.033
'Cause far as I can tell,
you've got drugs hidden,

14:31.100 --> 14:33.468
ooh, 3 feet from where I'm standing.

14:33.535 --> 14:34.902
Listen up, little English muffin.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.303
You ain't about to get in my head, man.

14:36.371 --> 14:37.871
You better get your ass a warrant.

14:37.939 --> 14:39.642
Where am I going to get
a warrant, you wanker?

14:39.710 --> 14:42.379
I'm not a cop.

14:42.447 --> 14:45.215
All right, then. How about...

14:45.282 --> 14:47.016
I start over here?

14:47.084 --> 14:49.018
You think? Eh?

14:55.091 --> 14:58.661
Hey, man. Come on, man!
That ain't necessary.

14:58.728 --> 15:00.129
Come on, man.

15:06.235 --> 15:07.802
What about in here?

15:07.870 --> 15:09.236
All right, man. Cool.

15:09.304 --> 15:11.104
All right. I'll tell you
what you want to know.

15:11.171 --> 15:13.806
Tell you all I know.

15:13.874 --> 15:15.974
Look, I heard a lot of loud shouting

15:16.042 --> 15:18.309
and some gunfire going
on directly below me.

15:18.377 --> 15:21.312
Then I seen those two punks
digging out of the back lot.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.313
Go on, ask your boy over
there. He know everything.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.915
He'll tell you I'm telling
the god-honest truth.

15:24.982 --> 15:27.650
Yeah, well, he's got a point.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.852
You heard shouting from below you?

15:31.220 --> 15:33.154
Listen, Hardy was answering

15:33.221 --> 15:34.989
a domestic disturbance call.

15:35.057 --> 15:37.491
Arguing was coming from the third floor.

15:37.559 --> 15:40.161
But he was shot before he
got to the right apartment.

15:40.228 --> 15:43.330
Yeah, but did anyone talk to those
tenants during the follow-up investigation?

15:43.397 --> 15:45.864
Well, there were some
apartments where no one was home.

15:45.932 --> 15:48.830
Maybe whoever was arguing downstairs

15:48.898 --> 15:50.665
saw someone with the shooters,

15:50.733 --> 15:53.167
but they got too scared
to talk, so they bolted.

15:53.235 --> 15:57.737
Yeah. It's like I always say,

15:57.805 --> 15:59.271
follow every lead.

16:00.306 --> 16:01.839
Right, Tevon?

16:01.907 --> 16:04.274
Whatever, man.

16:04.342 --> 16:06.109
I'm really uncomfortable with this.

16:06.176 --> 16:07.510
Knock, say it's you,

16:07.577 --> 16:08.944
and he opens the door voluntarily.

16:09.012 --> 16:11.346
We don't have 3 hours
to wait for a warrant.

16:13.915 --> 16:15.015
Yeah, Lightman.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.349
You ditched me,

16:16.417 --> 16:18.117
which is not good for
business or pleasure.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.218
It gave me minor pleasure.

16:20.286 --> 16:21.686
Ugh, sure.

16:23.154 --> 16:26.556
Hey.

16:26.624 --> 16:28.557
How you doing?

16:28.625 --> 16:30.826
- Good.
- Yeah?

16:30.893 --> 16:33.161
- What's your name?
- Olivia.

16:33.229 --> 16:34.897
What? Who's Olivia?

16:34.964 --> 16:36.632
Is that your doll?

16:37.700 --> 16:39.100
Can I have a look?

16:42.771 --> 16:44.739
Take a seat.

16:44.807 --> 16:47.008
It's all right. I won't bite you.

16:47.075 --> 16:49.109
What the hell is going on?

16:51.045 --> 16:54.080
I'm on the phone with a very mean lady

16:54.148 --> 16:56.383
who wants me to hear her secret.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.518
I don't want to hear her
secret. I want to hear yours.

16:58.586 --> 17:00.686
You got a secret, don't you, Olivia?

17:01.588 --> 17:02.855
Such professional behavior.

17:02.923 --> 17:05.924
I can't imagine why your
company's drowning in red ink.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.998
Mr. Jenkins isn't home.

17:12.066 --> 17:13.532
He's dead.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.303
Oh, yeah? When did he die?

17:16.371 --> 17:19.705
Last night. I saw them
taking him away in a bag.

17:19.773 --> 17:21.273
Who took him?

17:21.342 --> 17:22.608
The corner men.

17:22.676 --> 17:24.577
It said it on their backs.

17:24.645 --> 17:28.748
Hey, sweetheart,

17:28.816 --> 17:31.586
do you mean the coroners took him away?

17:31.653 --> 17:33.755
Did they have "coroner" written in yellow

17:33.823 --> 17:35.757
on the back of their jackets?

17:35.825 --> 17:38.927
Uh-huh. And they had a belt...

17:38.995 --> 17:40.128
Like yours.

17:40.196 --> 17:43.131
What do you mean, a belt with a gun?

17:43.199 --> 17:45.900
Like the police?

17:47.936 --> 17:49.770
How many cops work these projects?

17:49.837 --> 17:51.705
- About a dozen.
- I want pictures.

17:51.772 --> 17:53.539
I've got the district
book in my car, but...

17:53.607 --> 17:55.040
Good, I'll grab it on the way out.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.675
You're takin' a hell of a leap

17:56.743 --> 17:58.443
that cops were moving this body.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.011
I mean, how's a little
girl supposed to know

18:00.078 --> 18:02.279
if what she saw in the middle of the night

18:02.346 --> 18:04.213
were coroners, criminals, or cops?

18:04.281 --> 18:06.514
Coroners don't have guns,

18:06.582 --> 18:08.115
and criminals don't carry

18:08.183 --> 18:09.950
their weapons in holsters.

18:11.552 --> 18:13.419
Right, Olivia?

18:14.554 --> 18:17.156
See?

18:18.827 --> 18:21.630
Where is he?

18:21.898 --> 18:23.265
Where's Lightman?

18:23.333 --> 18:24.566
He left before us. I
thought he was here already.

18:24.633 --> 18:25.966
That was the morgue.

18:26.034 --> 18:28.702
No 70-year-old white males have
come in in the past 24 hours.

18:28.770 --> 18:30.910
Plus, there were no signs of
foul play at Jenkins' apartment.

18:30.978 --> 18:32.480
It's like the old man just vanished.

18:32.548 --> 18:34.319
And none of this means it was cops taking

18:34.387 --> 18:35.522
a body out of the building.

18:35.590 --> 18:36.990
Well, that's what we're
trying to find out.

18:37.058 --> 18:38.425
Follow every lead, remember?

18:38.493 --> 18:39.826
There isn't a single witness

18:39.894 --> 18:42.495
who was at that scene to
corroborate your theory.

18:42.563 --> 18:44.396
Actually, there was a witness.

18:44.464 --> 18:47.532
And I think I know why
Lightman isn't here.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.201
All right. Nick, these are pictures

18:50.269 --> 18:51.902
of the cops that work those projects.

18:51.970 --> 18:53.303
Let's see if any of them were there

18:53.371 --> 18:54.971
when you were laying
on the floor, shall we?

19:44.285 --> 19:46.519
That's officer Hollander.

19:48.088 --> 19:49.621
That's confirmation.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.989
Well done, mate.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.528
And another.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.830
Your pupils are on fire.

20:03.001 --> 20:05.502
You're on a roll.

20:05.570 --> 20:07.303
And again.

20:10.006 --> 20:11.607
You've been holding on long enough

20:11.674 --> 20:13.742
just to tell me this, haven't you?

20:22.081 --> 20:25.016
Do you want me to help you
say good-bye to your family?

20:26.651 --> 20:28.652
Right, then.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.428
Hey.

20:39.495 --> 20:42.096
Hi. Um,

20:42.164 --> 20:43.898
your husband wants you to know something.

20:43.966 --> 20:45.600
Wants to tell you something.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.701
I'm going to translate, if that's ok.

20:47.769 --> 20:49.603
Mm-hmm.

20:59.445 --> 21:02.480
Ok. Nick,

21:02.547 --> 21:03.981
when Janine was with you earlier,

21:04.049 --> 21:07.384
you were happy. You showed happiness.

21:09.286 --> 21:10.987
Is that 'cause you love her?

21:12.622 --> 21:14.523
Yeah, that's a yes.

21:16.759 --> 21:18.326
I see remorse.

21:18.394 --> 21:20.895
Am I reading that right?

21:21.996 --> 21:23.997
We'd been fighting.

21:24.064 --> 21:26.265
He was working long hours, and...

21:26.333 --> 21:28.266
I wanted him home.

21:30.271 --> 21:32.173
Where he'd be safe.

21:32.241 --> 21:35.344
Yeah.

21:35.411 --> 21:38.880
Do you care about any of that anymore?

21:40.249 --> 21:43.017
No. He loves you very much,

21:43.084 --> 21:44.685
you and Sophie.

21:44.753 --> 21:46.687
He always will.

21:50.190 --> 21:52.924
You can't fake that look.

22:04.803 --> 22:08.205
What... what's he saying now?

22:10.541 --> 22:13.142
Nothing.

22:13.210 --> 22:15.110
He's gone. I'm sorry.

22:15.178 --> 22:17.546
What?

22:17.614 --> 22:18.714
No.

22:36.229 --> 22:38.430
How did you read remorse on him?

22:38.498 --> 22:41.065
I didn't. I read it on her.

22:55.379 --> 22:57.146
All of these men are in the same unit.

22:57.214 --> 22:58.614
They cover the Eastmont Projects.

22:58.682 --> 23:01.216
But why would my men sneak a body out

23:01.284 --> 23:03.652
in the middle of the night and
leave one of their own to die?

23:03.719 --> 23:06.454
I know. It doesn't seem sporting, does it?

23:06.521 --> 23:07.855
Now, we're going to need
a lot more information

23:07.923 --> 23:09.790
before we confront these officers.

23:09.857 --> 23:12.626
We got a 70-year-old white
male matching our description

23:12.693 --> 23:14.027
that just turned up. Hey, you see?

23:14.095 --> 23:16.363
The coroner just misplaced
the body in the morgue.

23:16.431 --> 23:17.530
It happens all the time.

23:17.598 --> 23:18.765
I knew my guys were clean.

23:18.833 --> 23:20.500
Yeah, but we didn't find
this body in the morgue.

23:20.568 --> 23:22.335
We found it in a dumpster
3 blocks from the projects

23:22.403 --> 23:24.503
in a body bag like
that little girl said...

23:24.571 --> 23:26.171
badly beaten and stabbed to death.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.974
All right. Let's see how
you handle the morgue.

23:40.082 --> 23:43.750
Yeah, that's Mr. Jenkins, all right.

23:43.818 --> 23:45.418
Ok, I IDed a guy.

23:45.486 --> 23:46.920
Now I got to go back
to running a building.

23:46.987 --> 23:48.888
Hey, what are you so ashamed of?

23:48.956 --> 23:52.291
Nothing.

23:52.359 --> 23:53.725
You see my face?

23:53.793 --> 23:55.227
What's the expression on my face?

23:55.294 --> 23:56.628
What's it say to you? Does it say anger?

23:56.696 --> 23:58.396
Does it say impatience?

23:58.464 --> 24:00.398
Look, I'm just creeped out
by dead bodies, that's all.

24:00.465 --> 24:01.732
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:01.799 --> 24:03.700
All right, come here. Come here.

24:03.768 --> 24:06.102
All right. Look at this
guy. Go on. Look at it.

24:07.705 --> 24:11.073
See, you are telling the truth when
you say that you're creeped out,

24:11.141 --> 24:12.841
but why no shame for this one?

24:12.909 --> 24:15.077
What's your problem
with Jenkins over there?

24:15.145 --> 24:16.411
Nothing.

24:16.479 --> 24:17.612
You asked me to come
identify Mr. Jenkins...

24:17.680 --> 24:20.148
You see, that's a lie.
That's a lie right there.

24:21.617 --> 24:22.884
Come here.

24:22.951 --> 24:24.552
Identify him again.

24:24.620 --> 24:26.487
Identify him again.

24:28.456 --> 24:30.757
It's Mr. Jenkins.

24:30.825 --> 24:33.059
You see? Right there, that's deceit.

24:33.127 --> 24:34.794
Why are you lying about this man's name?

24:34.861 --> 24:36.462
I don't have to be here.

24:36.530 --> 24:38.030
You don't have no authority...

24:38.098 --> 24:39.364
let me explain something to you.

24:39.432 --> 24:41.766
Your building are registered
as section 8 housing.

24:41.834 --> 24:43.368
That's a federal program.

24:43.435 --> 24:45.770
So trust me, I have the authority.

24:50.808 --> 24:53.710
Why don't you take a wild
guess on what this is.

24:54.878 --> 24:57.713
That's the tenant list.

24:57.781 --> 24:58.948
The unit Jenkins lived in

24:59.015 --> 25:00.882
was registered with the federal government

25:00.950 --> 25:02.985
as a Mr. Kashdan.

25:03.052 --> 25:05.320
There's hundreds of tenants
covering 3 buildings.

25:05.388 --> 25:06.688
I can't keep track of them.

25:06.756 --> 25:08.123
- That's a lie.
- All right.

25:08.191 --> 25:09.591
How about we try this again?

25:09.659 --> 25:10.759
What do you know about Jenkins' death?

25:10.826 --> 25:12.093
I don't know anything.

25:12.161 --> 25:15.029
That building is filled
with junkies and gangbangers.

25:15.097 --> 25:16.264
The place is dangerous.

25:16.332 --> 25:17.965
Ok. That's lie number 2.

25:18.033 --> 25:19.933
One more of those, and I'm going to let

25:20.001 --> 25:21.435
Reynolds and James out there flip a coin

25:21.503 --> 25:23.203
over who locks you up tonight.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.905
I'll take heads.

25:27.508 --> 25:31.778
Look, I converted the
building to section 8 housing.

25:31.846 --> 25:35.615
I provide an apartment, the
feds pay me 90% of the rent.

25:35.683 --> 25:37.450
But you know what you really get is

25:37.518 --> 25:39.853
a building full of
crackheads and ex-cons.

25:39.921 --> 25:42.389
Things just got out of hand.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.795
You know, I'm smelling fear here.

25:48.863 --> 25:50.830
Oh, yeah.

25:50.898 --> 25:53.033
Of this one.

25:53.100 --> 25:55.435
And this one.

25:56.604 --> 25:58.205
And these other two.

25:58.272 --> 25:59.639
How does he know that?

25:59.707 --> 26:00.974
Eyelids.

26:01.042 --> 26:03.577
Uppers are severely
raised, lowers are tensed.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.913
Why are you so afraid of these cops?

26:09.317 --> 26:10.818
Look, a few years ago,

26:10.885 --> 26:12.252
they tell me they're gonna round up

26:12.320 --> 26:13.487
all the skells in the building,

26:13.555 --> 26:15.956
force 'em out, whether
they want to go or not.

26:16.024 --> 26:19.026
I would replace the
crackheads and the hookers

26:19.094 --> 26:21.528
with people who wouldn't
completely ruin the place.

26:21.596 --> 26:24.431
But you'd leave the original
tenants on the federal register

26:24.499 --> 26:27.635
so that the government would
continue to pay their rents.

26:27.702 --> 26:29.336
So you would get 2 rents per unit.

26:29.404 --> 26:31.439
But I didn't get any of the money.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.508
The cops kept it all. Uh-uh.

26:34.943 --> 26:37.911
Ok. I got 10%.

26:37.946 --> 26:39.379
But the cops took the rest of it.

26:39.447 --> 26:40.747
6 figures a year.

26:40.815 --> 26:44.383
And you told no one about this?

26:44.451 --> 26:46.218
Who am I supposed to go to

26:46.286 --> 26:48.521
when the problem are the police?

26:52.526 --> 26:54.093
Did you kill Jenkins?

26:54.161 --> 26:55.461
No.

26:55.529 --> 26:57.797
That's true.

26:59.299 --> 27:03.336
Jenkins threatened to rat
if we didn't cut him in.

27:03.403 --> 27:07.173
He was a big mouth, crazy old man.

27:07.241 --> 27:11.177
I tried to tell him not to make waves.

27:15.964 --> 27:17.698
His testimony alone
isn't going to be enough.

27:18.065 --> 27:19.833
His name is the only name
on those rent documents.

27:20.050 --> 27:22.485
Nothing leads us to the cops.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.820
Well, let me have a crack
at the shooters, then.

27:25.388 --> 27:27.655
These kids, they know the
cops can get them anywhere,

27:27.723 --> 27:28.889
even in prison.

27:28.957 --> 27:30.657
That's why they panicked
and shot officer Hardy

27:30.724 --> 27:32.324
and tried to serve Tevon up.

27:32.392 --> 27:33.925
Nothing scares a con like a dirty cop.

27:33.993 --> 27:36.426
If Hardy hadn't stumbled on those kids...

27:36.494 --> 27:39.095
It's what cops call mutt-luck.

27:39.963 --> 27:42.030
You all right there, Captain?

27:42.098 --> 27:44.264
'Cause I'm sensing a little guilt.

27:44.332 --> 27:45.998
Yeah, well, you'd feel guilty, too

27:46.066 --> 27:47.665
if you assigned a man
with a wife and daughter

27:47.733 --> 27:50.168
to the beat that got him killed.

27:50.236 --> 27:52.673
Listen, we'll take over
the investigation from here.

27:52.740 --> 27:54.610
I appreciate everything
you guys have done.

27:54.677 --> 27:57.750
Thank you very much. Ok.

28:04.432 --> 28:05.700
- Now?
- Yeah, go on.

28:05.768 --> 28:07.605
Ok. Ok.

28:08.710 --> 28:10.713
- Ta-da.
- Aww.

28:11.548 --> 28:12.815
Look at you.

28:12.883 --> 28:14.150
You look beautiful, Em.

28:14.218 --> 28:16.086
Thank you.

28:16.154 --> 28:18.158
I can't believe you
made me get dressed here.

28:18.226 --> 28:19.662
Well, you know, for 300 bucks,

28:19.730 --> 28:21.632
at least I should get a picture, right?

28:23.568 --> 28:24.670
There.

28:27.811 --> 28:29.145
You know, there was a time

28:29.213 --> 28:31.581
when me and your mum
couldn't get you into a dress.

28:31.648 --> 28:35.150
I used to eat nothing but yellow
foods, too, but things change.

28:35.218 --> 28:37.485
I wish they didn't have to.

28:37.553 --> 28:39.587
So, what's going on with you tonight?

28:39.654 --> 28:42.756
I'm working late. I've got a client.

28:42.824 --> 28:44.390
Oh, with Clara.

28:44.458 --> 28:46.592
What? No. It's business.

28:46.660 --> 28:48.594
No. That's... that's a lie.

28:48.661 --> 28:50.262
I can see that thing your eyes are doing.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.063
- What?
- They did it again.

28:52.130 --> 28:53.365
Do me a favor.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.266
You've have better luck
reading a Chinese phone book.

28:55.334 --> 28:56.567
All right, here we go.

28:56.635 --> 28:58.236
Oh! All right, now.

28:58.303 --> 28:59.570
- You see this?
- Mm-hmm.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.738
No less than 6 inches
between you and Dick.

29:01.806 --> 29:03.006
- Dad?
- What?

29:03.074 --> 29:04.741
Come on. It's Richard, and you know it.

29:04.808 --> 29:06.242
Oh, in that case, 12 inches.

29:10.646 --> 29:12.346
- You got a coat?
- Yeah, this is a coat.

29:12.414 --> 29:14.014
- That's not a coat.
- Yes.

29:14.082 --> 29:16.183
- It's a shrug.
- You look great.

29:16.251 --> 29:18.418
I've spent a fortune and
not looked half as good.

29:18.486 --> 29:19.986
Thank you.

29:22.055 --> 29:23.155
Have fun with your client.

29:23.223 --> 29:25.257
You have fun, too.

29:25.324 --> 29:27.258
The equity fund manager's
waiting at the boardroom.

29:27.325 --> 29:28.992
Yeah. We should go.
We're going to be late.

29:29.060 --> 29:32.995
Good luck. You can fill me in over dinner.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.635
So to speak. Or not.

29:35.703 --> 29:37.538
Focus.

29:41.743 --> 29:43.811
Right. John and George, right?

29:43.878 --> 29:45.212
They're talking about their new secretary.

29:45.279 --> 29:47.380
And John says, "I took her out last night,

29:47.448 --> 29:49.148
and we went at it all night.

29:49.216 --> 29:51.183
Yeah, she's better than my wife."

29:51.251 --> 29:53.185
So the next day, George comes in. He says,

29:53.253 --> 29:54.653
"I took her out last night.

29:54.720 --> 29:57.088
We went at it all night.

29:57.156 --> 29:59.556
I think you're right. I think
she is better than your wife."

30:03.961 --> 30:05.894
Right. Well, you're the boss,

30:05.962 --> 30:07.295
you know, 'cause everyone else,

30:07.363 --> 30:10.132
they waited just a millisecond
before they laughed.

30:10.199 --> 30:12.667
You, you laughed, but truth,
you found it offensive, right?

30:12.735 --> 30:14.168
Being the family man that you are, right?

30:14.236 --> 30:16.170
You, you got turned on by it.

30:16.238 --> 30:17.939
And you...

30:18.007 --> 30:21.175
well, you'd heard it before,
but you laughed anyway.

30:21.243 --> 30:23.744
Your laugh was fake. So.

30:23.811 --> 30:26.446
That's what we do,
gentlemen. We read people.

30:26.513 --> 30:28.381
If you're lying, cheating, or deceiving,

30:28.448 --> 30:29.615
your face will let us know

30:29.683 --> 30:31.684
before anything you're saying ever does.

30:31.752 --> 30:34.587
Well, I look forward to working with you.

30:43.128 --> 30:45.462
Well, you sure know how
to show a girl a good time.

30:45.530 --> 30:47.664
Well, it's been a while, has it?

30:47.731 --> 30:51.400
You know, everyone needs
a reminder now and then.

30:51.468 --> 30:54.502
So, what's this really all about, Clara?

30:54.570 --> 30:56.938
- I don't follow.
- Oh, that's 'cause

30:57.005 --> 30:59.240
you've been too busy
trying to lead, haven't you?

30:59.309 --> 31:02.244
Mmm. I paid good money for that privilege.

31:02.311 --> 31:04.278
Doing you a favor. 45 grand?

31:04.346 --> 31:06.213
That's chump change for
someone like you, isn't it?

31:06.281 --> 31:08.815
Now, if you were really
interested in what I do,

31:08.883 --> 31:10.283
you'd have made a play for me by now.

31:10.351 --> 31:13.287
Well, no. I mean, not play for me.

31:13.354 --> 31:14.754
A play for firm.

31:14.822 --> 31:17.558
Over your dead body.

31:18.660 --> 31:21.093
What's your game, Cal?

31:25.029 --> 31:26.962
Hello, Em.

31:27.030 --> 31:28.797
What?

31:28.865 --> 31:29.965
Now, say that again.

31:30.033 --> 31:35.403
All right. You say nothing until
I get there, you understand?

31:35.471 --> 31:37.338
- Nothing.
- What's wrong?

31:37.406 --> 31:38.539
You take the car.

31:38.607 --> 31:40.541
The bastards arrested
my daughter for drugs.

31:40.609 --> 31:42.443
Oi!

31:55.128 --> 31:56.461
Cal Lightman. Where's my daughter?

31:56.878 --> 32:00.080
Mr. Lightman, let's talk in here.

32:00.148 --> 32:03.149
Where's my daughter, officer?

32:03.216 --> 32:06.151
I can understand your
concern, also being a dad.

32:06.219 --> 32:08.652
These kids today, huh?

32:08.720 --> 32:09.987
Yeah. So, where is she?

32:10.055 --> 32:12.655
Take a breath. It's ok. She's coming.

32:12.723 --> 32:15.825
Seriously, take a breath, pal.

32:15.893 --> 32:20.596
Well, see, I just want her back.

32:20.663 --> 32:21.897
You're going to let her go, right?

32:21.964 --> 32:24.665
You seem like a smart guy, doting dad.

32:24.733 --> 32:27.735
We all make mistakes. Correct?

32:27.802 --> 32:29.503
Oh, yeah.

32:29.571 --> 32:33.172
There a reason not to let her go?

32:33.240 --> 32:35.741
Oh, no. Can't think of one.

32:35.809 --> 32:37.143
All right.

32:43.516 --> 32:44.783
All right, well, thank you.

32:44.851 --> 32:47.519
Don't mention it.

32:47.586 --> 32:49.554
That's it, then?

32:49.622 --> 32:52.858
You tell me if that's it.

32:55.963 --> 32:57.631
I think we understand each other.

32:57.699 --> 32:59.967
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

33:01.503 --> 33:04.638
Here she is now.

33:04.706 --> 33:06.941
Dad! I didn't do it, I
didn't do anything. I swear.

33:07.008 --> 33:09.444
I know that, love. I
absolutely, sweetheart.

33:09.512 --> 33:11.013
Count yourself lucky, Emily.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.681
Most kids around here don't get bail

33:12.749 --> 33:14.116
when they're caught with enough cocaine

33:14.184 --> 33:17.386
for an "intent to distribute."

33:17.454 --> 33:21.223
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

33:32.002 --> 33:33.603
I want to officially notify you

33:33.671 --> 33:36.440
that this is now an FBI investigation.

33:36.508 --> 33:37.775
Wait a minute. Wait.

33:37.843 --> 33:40.111
I came down here because you told me

33:40.178 --> 33:42.613
you were looking for a new
focus in the investigation.

33:42.681 --> 33:45.616
Yeah. The new focus is the
relationship between you

33:45.684 --> 33:47.017
and your boy Hollander.

33:47.085 --> 33:50.321
I told you I'd take care
of Hollander and his men.

33:50.389 --> 33:52.590
He crossed a line. That was my daughter.

33:52.658 --> 33:54.159
Yeah, and I'm sorry about that.

33:54.227 --> 33:56.461
You know what? That better be
genuine concern for my Emily,

33:56.529 --> 33:57.829
'cause as you can see,
my blood is well up,

33:57.897 --> 33:59.698
my judgment is way out
of whack, so keep talking.

33:59.766 --> 34:01.367
Those men were totally out of line.

34:01.434 --> 34:02.535
You know, the other night,

34:02.602 --> 34:04.969
you lied about the reasons for your guilt.

34:05.037 --> 34:06.703
You are to blame for Hardy's death,

34:06.771 --> 34:08.205
but not because you sent
him off to the projects,

34:08.272 --> 34:10.106
but because you're up to your eyes in this

34:10.172 --> 34:11.440
with Hollander and his thugs.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.542
Or should I say your thugs?

34:12.609 --> 34:14.011
And that wasn't a bloody question.

34:14.079 --> 34:16.714
You know what? This is a lot
more complicated than you think.

34:16.781 --> 34:19.248
Why? Whose side are you on, James?

34:19.317 --> 34:23.485
'Cause on the one hand, you
grieve for Hardy's death, right?

34:23.553 --> 34:25.219
But somehow, you're involved with

34:25.288 --> 34:26.721
the men responsible for it. So...

34:26.789 --> 34:28.188
He was a good man. James,

34:28.257 --> 34:29.590
why don't you save the B.S. for his widow

34:29.657 --> 34:31.324
and answer the question?

34:31.391 --> 34:33.657
You guys think that I'm
running a crew of dirty cops?

34:33.725 --> 34:35.391
No, I don't think it. I see it.

34:35.460 --> 34:36.659
Why are you protecting them?

34:36.728 --> 34:37.995
I'm not protecting them.

34:38.062 --> 34:39.029
No, you're protecting yourself.

34:39.097 --> 34:40.630
I'm coming at you, James,

34:40.697 --> 34:42.598
with everything I've got,
and you know that, don't you?

34:42.666 --> 34:44.300
Not just because of my daughter,

34:44.368 --> 34:46.034
but because of Hardy's wife and kid.

34:46.101 --> 34:48.003
You do remember them?

34:49.304 --> 34:51.605
A lot of people in those
projects are good people,

34:51.672 --> 34:53.442
just trying to live their lives.

34:53.510 --> 34:57.546
Which is hard enough without
dealers and pimps and scumbags.

34:57.614 --> 35:00.381
Well, I smell police vigilantism.

35:00.449 --> 35:03.581
Well, the people in that
building called it safety.

35:03.647 --> 35:06.810
You don't have to see what we see,

35:06.878 --> 35:09.579
day after day, year after year.

35:09.647 --> 35:11.580
4 years ago,

35:11.646 --> 35:14.513
I pulled a baby out of a
dumpster for the last time.

35:14.581 --> 35:19.082
That's when I had Hollander
and his crew set an example

35:19.150 --> 35:21.749
of a couple of the problem tenants,

35:21.817 --> 35:23.917
so the rest of the trash would know

35:23.985 --> 35:26.419
that they were not
tolerated in my projects.

35:26.486 --> 35:29.154
- Your projects?
- My projects!

35:29.221 --> 35:31.122
Somebody's got to own them.

35:31.189 --> 35:35.192
If we just did things by the
book, which doesn't exist, anyway,

35:35.260 --> 35:37.062
nothing would get done.

35:38.564 --> 35:41.166
I swear on my mother's grave,

35:41.233 --> 35:44.435
I didn't know Hollander
was running a rent scam,

35:44.502 --> 35:46.236
and I didn't know anything
about any killings.

35:46.303 --> 35:48.937
So, you really believed that
you were doing good there.

35:49.005 --> 35:50.271
I know I was doing good.

35:50.339 --> 35:53.507
You can't be that naive.

35:54.842 --> 35:57.942
Naive? No. Arrogant.

35:58.010 --> 36:01.946
Arrogant enough to believe that
my men would never let me down.

36:02.013 --> 36:04.715
Yeah, well, they did.

36:04.782 --> 36:06.216
So you're going to help us end this,

36:06.284 --> 36:07.884
if it's the last thing you do.

36:07.952 --> 36:11.888
You're going to go pick up
Hollander and bring him back here.

36:11.955 --> 36:14.390
We'll grab the other turd.

36:23.531 --> 36:24.731
Officer Tressler,

36:24.799 --> 36:26.833
FBI. You're under arrest.

36:26.900 --> 36:29.702
You can't just arrest an officer
of the law 'cause you feel like it.

36:29.769 --> 36:32.504
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

36:32.572 --> 36:35.807
Now you know how my daughter felt.

36:43.404 --> 36:45.939
Oh, there he is.

36:46.007 --> 36:48.076
I'm glad you could come.

36:48.143 --> 36:50.946
What's the matter? Did I strike a nerve?

36:51.013 --> 36:53.181
What, don't you like being
yanked out of your life

36:53.249 --> 36:54.549
to be here with me?

36:54.617 --> 36:56.317
You got nothing on me. This is bull.

36:56.385 --> 36:57.752
How's your daughter doin'?

36:57.819 --> 37:00.387
Oh, she's doing fine.
Grades have dropped a bit.

37:00.455 --> 37:01.755
Now, the boys have
already started talking.

37:01.823 --> 37:04.991
We've just got a couple
of quick questions for you.

37:25.348 --> 37:27.616
You have no right to keep
us here. Get me a lawyer.

37:27.684 --> 37:30.952
People who show genuine guilt and remorse

37:31.020 --> 37:32.453
are more likely to confess.

37:32.521 --> 37:33.688
You read that on which one?

37:33.755 --> 37:35.622
Officer Tressler. At the police station,

37:35.690 --> 37:37.424
Lightman read that
Tressler wasn't comfortable

37:37.492 --> 37:39.092
with what his partners
were doing to Emily.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.927
Yeah. If a member of a group dynamic feels

37:40.995 --> 37:43.295
that the group has strayed
from its moral code,

37:43.363 --> 37:45.631
that member's discomfort manifests itself

37:45.698 --> 37:47.466
in physical distancing from the group,

37:47.533 --> 37:49.634
micro-expressions of disagreement.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.803
And Lightman said that
this guy was showing

37:51.871 --> 37:53.738
all of those at the precinct.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.306
He's doing it right now. He's
on the opposite side of him.

38:00.477 --> 38:02.343
Hi.

38:02.411 --> 38:03.878
How you doing? You know what?

38:03.945 --> 38:07.246
He's the worst kind of
cop, don't you think?

38:07.314 --> 38:08.547
He's a good cop.

38:08.615 --> 38:11.582
His voice trailed off.
He doesn't believe that.

38:11.650 --> 38:13.651
I'm sorry. Could you say that again?

38:13.719 --> 38:16.120
It's mind games. It's all mind games.

38:16.188 --> 38:17.488
You know, you can go.

38:17.556 --> 38:19.626
Yeah, we don't need you anymore.

38:19.694 --> 38:22.698
We've got him. Seriously, off you go.

38:24.200 --> 38:27.302
What? What, you scared, are you?

38:27.369 --> 38:29.671
You scared to leave
without your boyfriend here?

38:31.573 --> 38:32.907
I think I want a lawyer.

38:32.975 --> 38:34.509
He used the word "think."

38:34.576 --> 38:36.477
He's equivocating. He
wants to unburden himself.

38:36.545 --> 38:39.313
You know, I think I know
what Captain James was doing,

38:39.381 --> 38:40.647
or thought he was
doing, in those projects.

38:40.715 --> 38:44.218
He was taking out trash, right?

38:44.286 --> 38:47.922
Ooh, look at you. That's pride, that is.

38:47.990 --> 38:51.225
He's puffed up like a peacock.

38:51.293 --> 38:53.194
- Lawyer.
- Now, that's fair enough.

38:53.261 --> 38:54.562
Yeah, you can have a lawyer.

38:54.629 --> 38:57.031
But I'm not asking you to say
anything to incriminate you.

38:57.098 --> 38:59.599
No. Not verbally, anyway.

38:59.667 --> 39:00.900
His face has already
told me you killed Hardy.

39:00.968 --> 39:02.601
That's a lie. I did not!

39:02.669 --> 39:05.437
No, no, I'm sorry. I mean had
him killed. Had him killed.

39:05.505 --> 39:06.973
Had him killed. That's it. Right.

39:07.041 --> 39:09.945
Those kids...

39:11.481 --> 39:12.614
It was an accident.

39:12.682 --> 39:14.616
Well, now we're getting somewhere.

39:14.684 --> 39:17.051
Ok. Ok. We're through.
We're through here. Let's go.

39:17.119 --> 39:18.386
Here we go.

39:18.453 --> 39:20.287
You know, you left Hardy,

39:20.355 --> 39:23.222
a father and a husband,

39:23.290 --> 39:25.357
to bleed out alone.

39:26.893 --> 39:28.826
He's gonna do you next,
you know that, don't you?

39:28.894 --> 39:30.228
All right. Shut up. That's enough.

39:30.295 --> 39:32.163
Make me.

39:32.230 --> 39:35.734
Go on. Make me.

39:35.802 --> 39:38.038
No. I want you to...

39:38.105 --> 39:40.941
make me.

39:41.877 --> 39:43.444
Then you went after my daughter.

39:43.512 --> 39:44.679
- No.
- No?

39:44.747 --> 39:46.181
Well, his Adam's apple says yes.

39:46.248 --> 39:48.817
You know, look at it. It's
like a cork in a storm.

39:48.885 --> 39:51.220
And you see that look? That's very common

39:51.288 --> 39:54.123
on people with intent to commit murder.

39:54.191 --> 39:56.894
16, my daughter.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.362
She's 16.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.031
Some man you are.

40:00.099 --> 40:01.900
Don't look at him. He can't help you.

40:03.436 --> 40:05.538
I didn't want to.

40:05.606 --> 40:06.973
You didn't want to what?

40:07.040 --> 40:08.241
What, threaten my family?

40:08.308 --> 40:10.076
No, but you did, though, didn't you?

40:10.143 --> 40:11.143
You went along with it, didn't you?

40:11.211 --> 40:12.311
'Cause you're scared of him.

40:12.379 --> 40:15.048
- I'm not. No.
- No?

40:15.116 --> 40:16.383
- Coffee break?
- Yes.

40:16.450 --> 40:18.452
Yes.

40:22.991 --> 40:25.093
Wait.

40:25.161 --> 40:27.829
I only knew about the
two boys killing Jenkins.

40:30.867 --> 40:31.968
Excuse me?

40:32.035 --> 40:35.171
We saw Hardy lying there, bleeding out.

40:35.239 --> 40:37.174
But Jenkins was already dead.

40:37.241 --> 40:38.575
His apartment door was wide open.

40:38.643 --> 40:40.477
- That's enough.
- We closed it,

40:40.545 --> 40:41.779
and we moved the body later.

40:41.847 --> 40:45.483
You killed Jenkins to shut
him up about your rent scam.

40:45.551 --> 40:47.051
That's it.

40:47.119 --> 40:48.887
I just wanted to make a few extra bucks,

40:48.955 --> 40:51.056
and then, this Jenkins
guy starts causing trouble.

40:51.124 --> 40:52.157
- Shut up.
- What are you doing?

40:52.225 --> 40:53.559
You're smarter than this. Come on.

40:53.627 --> 40:55.728
And next thing I know, Hollander
tells me that he's dead,

40:55.796 --> 40:58.064
and we have to move the body.

40:58.132 --> 41:01.068
Oh! Lightman!

41:05.972 --> 41:07.971
You know, prison's too good for you, mate.

41:08.038 --> 41:10.272
But I suppose it will have to do.

41:11.306 --> 41:13.672
I've made a couple of calls.

41:13.740 --> 41:16.040
I've let them know you're coming.

41:21.541 --> 41:23.304
I said 45 grand, by the way.

41:23.372 --> 41:26.302
Consider it a discount for ditching me.

41:26.370 --> 41:27.633
Oh, yeah.

41:27.701 --> 41:30.564
Hey. So, Captain James will cut a deal,

41:30.632 --> 41:33.565
but the rest of 'em are
looking at a life sentence.

41:33.633 --> 41:35.400
Well, if I was on James' jury,

41:35.468 --> 41:38.503
I'd be inclined to give
him a second chance.

41:38.570 --> 41:39.670
Here.

41:39.738 --> 41:42.673
Hmm.

41:42.741 --> 41:44.007
Would you like some more good news?

41:44.075 --> 41:45.675
- Yeah?
- You got the loan?

41:45.743 --> 41:46.743
7 figures.

41:46.811 --> 41:48.845
It'll keep us afloat for at least a year,

41:48.912 --> 41:51.947
long enough to get us back on our feet.

41:52.015 --> 41:53.782
Congratulations.

41:53.850 --> 41:56.017
Well done, Foster.

41:56.085 --> 41:57.819
You should thank Clara for getting
us in touch with the equity firm.

41:57.886 --> 42:00.121
I'm just excited we're
going to be working together.

42:00.189 --> 42:01.956
- Excuse me?
- Come again?

42:02.023 --> 42:04.391
Well, as the majority
investor of that equity firm,

42:04.459 --> 42:05.792
I can't wait to turn this place

42:05.860 --> 42:08.361
into the cash-cow it should be.

42:08.429 --> 42:10.329
Sky's the limit.

42:11.298 --> 42:12.931
I'll leave you two to celebrate.

42:12.999 --> 42:16.101
I'll call you tomorrow
to talk over some details.

42:16.169 --> 42:17.936
Your place or mine?

42:18.004 --> 42:20.171
Well, your place is mine, now.

42:25.578 --> 42:27.212
That's the best you can do?

42:27.280 --> 42:31.282
So, you've been hanging
around with me for,

42:31.350 --> 42:33.117
you know, a few days now.

42:33.185 --> 42:34.252
That makes you an expert, does it?

42:34.319 --> 42:36.987
I told you, I'm a quick study.

42:37.055 --> 42:40.357
I believe in business and pleasure.

42:43.927 --> 42:45.661
Proud of you.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.396
- For what?
- Admit it.

42:47.464 --> 42:49.898
You were holding out for
more than just a handshake.

42:51.233 --> 42:53.534
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

42:55.804 --> 42:58.905
7 figures.

42:58.973 --> 43:00.707
You know, this is all your fault.

43:00.775 --> 43:03.009
You're welcome.
