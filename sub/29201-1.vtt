00:43.292 --> 00:45.156
Come on, hurry up!

00:45.358 --> 00:47.158
We're late, on stage!

00:47.810 --> 00:49.310
- Did someone see the baby?
- Where do you put it?

00:49.521 --> 00:52.294
- Behind !
- I'll see if the audience is there.

00:52.351 --> 00:53.851
Someone saw the baby!

00:54.274 --> 00:56.273
The spectators are there, quickly!

00:56.360 --> 00:59.174
- Someone saw the baby!
- Did you look in the closet!

00:59.806 --> 01:02.002
- Oh, yes, the wardrobe.
- Where should I put the tree?

01:02.057 --> 01:03.791
We said the tree behind.

01:05.253 --> 01:07.494
- Hey, did you see the baby?
- I think he was there.

01:07.562 --> 01:10.447
- And you, did you see the pig?
- He just passed.

01:10.497 --> 01:11.249
Oh good.

01:11.671 --> 01:14.474
We are not ready, the
spectators wait.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.132
You, do the intro for the
urge someone to wait.

01:17.218 --> 01:18.772
- What now ?
- Yes.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.161
I'm not ready.

01:22.341 --> 01:24.746
Well, hello dear public.

01:24.916 --> 01:27.993
Welcome to our show, we
are the troupe of the flowered val

01:28.017 --> 01:30.485
and we are going to
interpret three pieces.

01:30.606 --> 01:32.840
The first is entitled
a baby to deliver.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.722
This is the story of a stork

01:34.866 --> 01:36.741
We can not find the baby anymore
must change title.

01:36.866 --> 01:38.769
- What do you mean ?
- Because there are no more babies.

01:39.275 --> 01:41.681
- What do you replace it with?
- Good question.

01:44.043 --> 01:47.277
Guys, I found, we
replaced by a watermelon.

01:47.632 --> 01:49.514
Ah, good, very good.

01:50.022 --> 01:52.991
Our first will be titled
a watermelon to deliver.

01:53.039 --> 01:56.374
This is the story of a stork who
must deliver a baby watermelon

01:56.542 --> 01:58.909
to his watermelon parents and who ...

01:58.925 --> 02:00.196
It's ok, we found the baby.

02:00.306 --> 02:01.821
Ah, where was he?

02:01.977 --> 02:03.377
Behind the watermelon.

02:04.455 --> 02:06.367
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

02:06.407 --> 02:08.970
here, a baby to deliver!

02:10.435 --> 02:13.102
We are not ready,
we are not ready!

02:13.127 --> 02:14.840
Excuse us, we are not
not quite ready

02:15.108 --> 02:15.750
Take this !

02:16.124 --> 02:18.324
- The scale !
- I'm taking care of it !

02:18.433 --> 02:21.020
AH!

02:23.353 --> 02:24.953
It's good, we're ready!

02:25.126 --> 02:28.562
Ladies and gentlemen,
a baby to deliver!

03:09.651 --> 03:13.103
- What are you doing ?
- Well, I ... garden!

03:13.105 --> 03:15.565
- I will help you !
- No, no, that's nice.

03:15.605 --> 03:17.145
- It'll be fine.
- What are you doing ?

03:17.205 --> 03:20.570
- We garden.
- I love it, I'll help you.

03:20.716 --> 03:23.475
No, thank you, I do not need help.

03:23.523 --> 03:24.523
I cut it!

03:24.610 --> 03:28.676
You know, do not touch my beans,
it's hard enough to grow.

03:28.726 --> 03:30.630
- OK.
- Well, I cut weeds.

03:30.662 --> 03:33.638
- That's it !
- What about me?

03:35.201 --> 03:36.535
Yeah, squash!

03:39.274 --> 03:41.647
Stop, what are you doing?

03:41.711 --> 03:44.977
Ben I cut the bad
herbs, that's what you told me!

03:45.002 --> 03:47.548
But, these are not bad
herbs, they are carrots.

03:55.924 --> 03:59.360
STOP, it's toxic!

04:00.279 --> 04:02.389
- Mmmmmm!
- What?

04:03.064 --> 04:04.644
It is to eliminate the caterpillars.

04:04.659 --> 04:07.118
But there is not any
caterpillars, come on, ouste!

04:07.198 --> 04:10.635
There may be no caterpillars,
but there are huge pests.

04:10.725 --> 04:11.971
These are tomatoes!

04:12.035 --> 04:13.857
So, I stopped your
tomato invasion.

04:13.881 --> 04:16.635
- It's not true !
- Do not thank me, especially.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.558
Well, what to do now!

04:18.921 --> 04:21.459
Nothing, leave the camp!

04:21.538 --> 04:24.061
Hula, we do that to help!

04:24.109 --> 04:25.791
It's okay, go elsewhere!

04:25.865 --> 04:27.920
Do not you want this tree to be cut?

04:27.959 --> 04:31.101
I warn you, the first
who touches my apple tree!

04:32.766 --> 04:36.472
- Wow !
- A baby !

04:37.232 --> 04:38.232
I'm a dad.

04:38.859 --> 04:40.970
But where does it come from?

04:44.025 --> 04:45.025
Rrrh!

04:48.854 --> 04:49.854
Ah!

04:51.757 --> 04:56.681
Ah, I'm suffering!

04:57.761 --> 04:59.126
What happened to you ?

04:59.158 --> 05:03.174
I was flying peacefully
when all of a sudden....

05:03.487 --> 05:05.574
this tree hit me.

05:05.686 --> 05:06.979
Oh no, this is an apple tree.

05:06.990 --> 05:09.815
The violence of shock
broke my wings.

05:10.648 --> 05:13.385
I can not fly anymore.

05:13.481 --> 05:17.231
You can stay, the time that
it repairs, it does not matter.

05:17.263 --> 05:20.063
Not serious, but it's
a disaster !

05:20.146 --> 05:21.971
A tragedy !

05:22.129 --> 05:27.259
If I do not deliver on time
this little girl, she will be an orphan.

05:30.598 --> 05:35.478
Unless someone devotes himself
to do it for me.

05:35.510 --> 05:38.656
What, but I'm only one
pig, I do not know how to do that.

05:38.689 --> 05:40.482
No worries, it's very easy.

05:40.516 --> 05:43.243
- No, it's impossible.
- Make an effort !

05:43.260 --> 05:45.259
Enough, do not insist.

05:45.522 --> 05:47.894
Would you dare to give up this child?

05:47.911 --> 05:50.506
We can take care of it!

05:51.983 --> 05:53.495
- I'll take care of it, finally.

05:53.536 --> 05:55.004
Certainly not, you
are only a pig.

05:55.083 --> 05:56.882
- You do not know how to do it.
- But if !

05:56.915 --> 05:59.859
- It's easy.
- That's enough, do not insist!

06:00.292 --> 06:02.292
Here, her name is Pauline.

06:02.569 --> 06:05.172
Here is his bottle and his address.

06:05.253 --> 06:08.375
Thank you and have a good trip !

06:08.454 --> 06:11.454
Wait, you do not realize!

06:11.502 --> 06:12.628
What is the problem ?

06:12.652 --> 06:15.294
But they are unable to
take care of a baby.

06:15.349 --> 06:16.991
These are public dangers.

06:17.015 --> 06:19.063
Listen, it's not because
you do not like children

06:19.096 --> 06:21.523
that we must prevent
others to take care of it.

06:21.580 --> 06:23.214
But, look at them, they are .....

06:23.612 --> 06:25.262
Where are they ?

06:27.909 --> 06:30.975
- You're sure it'll work!
- But yes !

06:31.245 --> 06:33.006
There is the address to deliver.

06:33.070 --> 06:36.028
Of course, if you throw hard enough,
there will be no problem.

06:36.069 --> 06:37.489
Here we go !

06:37.523 --> 06:40.634
STOP, stop, you are crazy!

06:40.785 --> 06:42.515
Put this rope.

06:42.945 --> 06:46.010
A baby in a catapult,
it's too dangerous.

06:46.035 --> 06:47.844
Well, it was just for
send her home.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.955
Come on, come here!

06:50.379 --> 06:53.466
Now, bring this baby back to the stork.

06:53.530 --> 06:55.728
Oh, hey, that's okay, here we go.

06:57.589 --> 06:59.359
AH!

07:11.732 --> 07:16.579
You know, I thought, the catapult
is not a good idea.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.669
And if we went on foot!

07:18.697 --> 07:20.768
- That's a good idea
- Oh no,

07:21.114 --> 07:23.088
You do not understand,
we're not going anywhere,

07:23.113 --> 07:24.939
we bring this baby back to the stork.

07:24.962 --> 07:28.295
- We can not handle it.
- Of course if, on the road!

07:28.426 --> 07:30.402
Because you know where Avignon is!

07:30.427 --> 07:31.529
Of course, it's at .....

07:32.892 --> 07:34.415
We will ask.

07:35.225 --> 07:38.291
I thought I understood that
you go to Avignon.

07:38.748 --> 07:41.643
We, we know well, we go
every summer with the family.

07:41.706 --> 07:45.384
It's not complicated, when
you are at the crossroads,

07:45.416 --> 07:48.677
the 4th on the right is 782.

07:48.763 --> 07:50.937
Do not take it, go straight;

07:51.025 --> 07:53.159
then take the 2nd left

07:53.389 --> 07:57.055
turn right, immediately
on the left, the roundabout

07:57.143 --> 07:59.640
- you take.....
- Atchoum!

08:01.505 --> 08:02.505
It's pollen.

08:03.501 --> 08:05.401
I found someone to help us.

08:05.790 --> 08:07.861
Here, Mr. Wolf!

08:08.851 --> 08:10.525
Hello, gentlemen!

08:10.605 --> 08:13.528
I have to eat before leaving.

08:13.616 --> 08:15.283
Go ahead, no problem.

08:15.949 --> 08:17.536
But, it's a wolf!

08:17.840 --> 08:20.435
- Mr. Wolf is a wolf.
- Do not stay here.

08:20.512 --> 08:23.718
- He will eat us.
- No, he's having a snack.

08:23.806 --> 08:27.472
- It's ready soon.
- Take your time.

08:30.048 --> 08:32.460
Do not stay here!

08:33.943 --> 08:37.390
Excuse him, he's in a hurry,
we do not have to .....

08:37.780 --> 08:41.058
- leave immediately.
- At table !

08:44.159 --> 08:46.088
You were right !

08:53.452 --> 08:54.952
The truck !

09:09.060 --> 09:11.202
At first, he looked nice!

09:12.517 --> 09:15.357
- Hum, ah!

09:22.010 --> 09:24.168
Good idea, the truck!

09:24.741 --> 09:28.674
No, I think I forgot
the bottle in the truck.

09:28.909 --> 09:32.694
Ah, you scared me, I thought
that you had forgotten the baby.

09:35.220 --> 09:38.953
- I do not believe that.
- Do not worry, we'll find her.

09:44.981 --> 09:46.790
We found her!

09:58.658 --> 09:59.658
Pauline!

10:02.636 --> 10:04.262
We were so afraid of losing you.

10:04.374 --> 10:06.611
Do not worry, we stop the nonsense.

10:07.008 --> 10:08.897
Go, on the way!

10:10.490 --> 10:13.203
We'll deliver it, this baby, hang on!

10:13.888 --> 10:15.483
How to start this thing!

10:17.755 --> 10:19.040
My truck!

10:22.553 --> 10:25.155
Here we go, now,
where are we going ?

10:25.183 --> 10:28.289
- We must turn there.
- No, it's on the other side.

10:31.891 --> 10:34.073
Do what I tell you, it's
me watching.

10:36.392 --> 10:38.392
It's you or me driving!

10:40.426 --> 10:42.783
- Over there.
- Not at all.

10:43.901 --> 10:45.168
Give me the card.

10:47.589 --> 10:51.152
- So there it is !
- No, thank you, it's you driving.

11:08.737 --> 11:12.291
The baby, where is Pauline?

11:12.886 --> 11:16.071
- Not here.
- Not here either.

11:16.182 --> 11:19.903
But where is she, Pauline!

11:25.953 --> 11:28.619
Water is your element, go get it.

11:28.871 --> 11:31.689
- Slowly !
- What, gently?

11:31.731 --> 11:33.604
Yes, that is, in fact,

11:33.783 --> 11:38.298
Uh, you'll laugh, but
I do not know how to swim.

11:38.368 --> 11:40.542
What, but float!

11:40.612 --> 11:44.580
It's good, I found a way to .....

11:44.626 --> 11:46.919
go find Pauline
safely.

11:47.302 --> 11:50.730
Wait ... uh, I'm going
maybe come with you.

11:52.307 --> 11:56.343
Right, left ..... very well!

11:56.986 --> 11:59.091
Gently, that's right!

12:00.663 --> 12:03.003
We arrive.......

12:05.321 --> 12:08.524
I hold you, it's good,
we can go !

12:18.438 --> 12:22.033
Who do you say thank you, Pauline!

12:26.521 --> 12:33.113
Ouch, wow!

12:42.025 --> 12:43.684
Uh, are you ok?

12:44.723 --> 12:46.508
You are angry !

12:48.713 --> 12:52.443
Come on, do not worry, we do
a good team, three!

12:52.539 --> 12:56.102
We will get there, look, we have
a car to go faster.

12:56.148 --> 13:00.846
Come and see, it's thundering, a
little gas, a match and ...

13:05.457 --> 13:08.170
That's it, we give up!

13:08.239 --> 13:10.239
What do you mean !

13:10.843 --> 13:13.029
We stop the fees, we come back to the farm.

13:13.664 --> 13:16.259
And Pauline, we have to bring her back
at their parents place.

13:16.288 --> 13:19.224
His parents, we do not know
not even where it is!

13:19.304 --> 13:22.268
We left for 8 hours and we
is still 200 m from the farm!

13:22.292 --> 13:24.268
Oh, you're exaggerating!

13:26.185 --> 13:28.432
There is, at least, 300 m!

13:28.639 --> 13:32.916
Remember what the stork said,
if we do nothing, she will be an orphan.

13:32.967 --> 13:35.340
With us, she was almost
devoured by a wolf,

13:35.404 --> 13:36.714
kidnapped by a butcher

13:36.738 --> 13:39.698
not to mention the catapult she
nearly drowned in a lake.

13:39.729 --> 13:42.466
Is it good for a baby?

13:42.650 --> 13:46.856
And you acted without thinking,
you are two morons!

13:46.912 --> 13:52.435
- Oh yes, you think without acting.
- Well, we try at least.

13:52.472 --> 13:54.400
So, try without me.

13:54.457 --> 13:57.520
(Baby's words)

14:03.123 --> 14:06.044
Oh, sorry, Pauline!

14:06.227 --> 14:09.203
We must face the facts,
we can not take care of you.

14:10.246 --> 14:14.380
We must entrust you to humans,
they will take care of you.

14:19.556 --> 14:21.460
Hey, there are two coming.

14:25.024 --> 14:26.557
Uh, no, not those!

14:45.062 --> 14:47.855
- Ah, ah ...
- Chum!

14:51.166 --> 14:52.650
Ah!

14:56.912 --> 14:58.277
But what is this ?

14:58.333 --> 14:59.333
Rabbit!

14:59.628 --> 15:03.336
You killed him, assassins!

15:04.749 --> 15:05.949
Rabbit, talk to me!

15:06.243 --> 15:08.710
- Pauline!
- You saved her life.

15:08.735 --> 15:10.468
I can leave alone.

15:11.767 --> 15:13.648
Stay with us, Rabbit!

15:13.680 --> 15:15.947
- I'm in a tunnel!
- No.

15:16.053 --> 15:19.370
- I see a light at the bottom.
- Turn back.

15:19.511 --> 15:21.336
Someone is talking to me!

15:21.724 --> 15:25.851
It's a carrot, she wants
I'm eating it, I'm coming!

15:27.479 --> 15:30.249
What is this,
a dart!

15:31.601 --> 15:33.334
Stop, he's not dead.

15:33.735 --> 15:35.069
He's just drugged.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.437
Humans shot him with
a dart of tranquilizer.

15:42.310 --> 15:46.111
- He is really calm!
- Bizarre, it's for wild beasts.

15:48.573 --> 15:51.373
- It's broken.
- Thanks, I noticed.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.954
Well, where is the rabbit?

15:54.782 --> 15:59.141
- Is it there!
- Uh, I do not think so.

15:59.157 --> 16:00.069
Ask him !

16:00.094 --> 16:02.498
- Go ahead, you know him better.
- Yes, but you ask the questions better.

16:02.528 --> 16:05.210
- Rabbit, is it you?
- Carrot!

16:06.129 --> 16:08.629
- Carrot!
- Yeah, I'm ....

16:08.687 --> 16:12.579
- It's good, we're leaving.
- ????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ...

16:12.815 --> 16:15.489
- ????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ....
- I did not understand.

16:18.041 --> 16:20.168
????? ???????? ?????????? ?? !

16:33.415 --> 16:35.169
How are you feeling better?

16:35.765 --> 16:38.756
Er, yes, where are we?

16:38.970 --> 16:42.208
- In the forest, you remember!
- Who is he ?

16:43.513 --> 16:47.044
- We do not really know.
- ????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ....

16:47.225 --> 16:51.034
????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ...

16:51.167 --> 16:54.635
????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ..

16:55.068 --> 16:59.296
Yes, he speaks to us since yesterday
evening and we do not understand anything.

16:59.471 --> 17:02.265
He says he comes from China
and escaped from the zoo

17:02.305 --> 17:04.670
and last night's humans have
tried to capture him.

17:04.707 --> 17:07.563
????? ???????? ?????????? ??

17:07.643 --> 17:09.714
????? ???????? ?????????? ??

17:09.864 --> 17:15.035
????? ???????? ?????????? ??

17:15.075 --> 17:17.075
????? ???????? ?????????? ??

17:17.305 --> 17:20.092
- Do you speak Chinese?
- Yes.

17:20.267 --> 17:22.134
????? ???????? ?????????? ??

17:22.358 --> 17:24.301
- What's he saying ?
- Thank you.

17:24.382 --> 17:25.556
Why ?

17:25.615 --> 17:28.432
He wants to go home, so I told him
says that it can be sent by mail.

17:28.569 --> 17:31.529
We put it in a package, a
Chinese address and hop!

17:31.573 --> 17:34.326
- He arrives directly at home.
- Direct at home!

17:34.653 --> 17:37.002
Yes N !

17:37.931 --> 17:39.272
You are a genius !

17:42.805 --> 17:44.246
???? ???? ?? ??????? ???????

17:44.342 --> 17:46.691
???? ???? ?? ??????? ???????

17:46.787 --> 17:48.440
???? ???? ?? ??????? ???????

17:51.996 --> 17:54.860
Come on, you'll be good at home.

17:55.020 --> 17:57.020
It's time to say goodbye.

17:57.306 --> 18:00.401
Your parents are very lucky!

18:02.290 --> 18:04.099
Yes N !

18:04.362 --> 18:07.671
Who am I, goodbye, Pauline!

18:10.115 --> 18:11.115
Yes N !

18:11.686 --> 18:13.805
Now, you have to drop those packages.

18:13.883 --> 18:14.883
I have an idea.

18:20.609 --> 18:24.085
Oh, no, it's not a good idea!

18:24.598 --> 18:28.241
I summarize, this one goes into
China and that one in Avignon.

18:32.933 --> 18:35.099
This is the one who goes to Avignon, then!

18:36.701 --> 18:39.549
That's it, that's what
I thought, you confirm!

18:39.915 --> 18:41.987
Hey, there are people waiting.

18:42.031 --> 18:44.071
Sir, you confirm!

18:44.932 --> 18:46.963
All right, let's go.

18:50.780 --> 18:52.265
What did you do ?

18:52.868 --> 18:55.550
I may have switched the packages.

18:55.590 --> 18:59.723
There is a chance in two for
Pauline go to China!

18:59.780 --> 19:01.637
There is a chance in two for
that she finds herself at home.

19:03.719 --> 19:05.519
It is necessary to recover this parcel.

19:15.011 --> 19:16.011
Pauline!

19:17.598 --> 19:20.276
Do not worry, now
everything will be alright.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.266
One last parcel and en route.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.130
I admit, I did not think.

19:44.659 --> 19:46.143
In my opinion, we arrived.

19:54.147 --> 19:55.583
Ah, here we are.

19:59.652 --> 20:01.596
Oh, we arrived.

20:04.868 --> 20:07.312
I do not believe that !

20:07.408 --> 20:08.739
Serious, it's just a detour.

20:08.906 --> 20:10.286
Yes N !

20:10.700 --> 20:13.294
But how are you doing for
to be so carefree!

20:13.522 --> 20:16.307
We are going to raise a baby in China and
it does not bother you more than that!

20:17.364 --> 20:19.713
On the plane, you can not
not control everything.

20:19.944 --> 20:21.594
You have to let go.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.125
- We failed.
- What?

20:24.285 --> 20:27.411
We failed, Pauline does not
will never find his parents.

20:27.955 --> 20:30.875
- Oh there, do not worry.
- We will find a solution.

20:30.946 --> 20:36.382
We will find a solution, of course, we
can take the controls of the plane!

20:37.835 --> 20:40.168
Take care of Pauline, we're coming back.

20:40.995 --> 20:43.701
Yes N !

20:43.909 --> 20:46.972
Well, I say to my wife, you'll see
that they will put us a supplement.

20:50.570 --> 20:54.982
Well, that did not disappoint, all that
to be able to raise the prices.

20:56.628 --> 20:58.945
Me, I never put my feet back.

20:59.414 --> 21:01.814
Where are you going this year?

21:09.292 --> 21:12.657
They succeeded !

21:13.754 --> 21:16.619
Otherwise, there is Greece, it's not bad.

21:20.243 --> 21:22.012
Atchoum!

21:25.479 --> 21:26.835
Pauline!

21:33.715 --> 21:35.294
Pauline!

21:37.076 --> 21:40.091
- And now, what are we doing?
- I do not know.

21:45.979 --> 21:47.979
There is only one thing to do.

21:59.787 --> 22:03.104
- Touch !
- We only have to open it!

22:03.129 --> 22:04.851
Yes N !

22:24.607 --> 22:25.807
- Mr. Tarsier!
- What?

22:25.866 --> 22:26.683
????? ?? ?????????

22:26.882 --> 22:29.483
???????? ?? ??????? ?????

22:29.797 --> 22:31.860
Wait, if you are there,

22:32.654 --> 22:33.987
we are at home

22:34.835 --> 22:36.486
at Pauline's.

22:38.805 --> 22:40.605
This time, you are at home.

22:40.804 --> 22:42.548
This is where our paths
separate,

22:42.573 --> 22:44.702
I hope you'll be
happy with your parents.

22:45.536 --> 22:47.194
Yes N !

22:58.123 --> 23:02.037
Oh, Henry, we have a new baby!

23:02.227 --> 23:05.298
64a is the house next door.

23:05.730 --> 23:07.595
I want my mom.

23:13.335 --> 23:16.375
Look, it's our baby,
he arrived.

23:16.471 --> 23:18.802
Yes N !

23:18.842 --> 23:21.698
- She's cute!
- How are we going to call him?

23:22.120 --> 23:23.120
Pauline!

23:25.366 --> 23:29.470
- And here we are delivered, this baby.
- Yes, we did a good job.

23:33.863 --> 23:35.569
Goodbye, Pauline.

23:52.152 --> 23:55.254
Ah, it's good to be
back home.

23:57.580 --> 24:00.849
- Well, I'm tired,
- I'm going to bed.

24:01.710 --> 24:03.472
- Good night !
- So good night !

24:04.420 --> 24:10.563
So here I tell them, my wing is
broken because of the fir tree.

24:11.357 --> 24:13.928
And they believed me, those idiots.

24:14.705 --> 24:16.680
Will know where they are now.

24:16.776 --> 24:17.776
Ben there!

24:18.436 --> 24:22.118
- Good evening!
- Uh, well, goodnight!

24:22.142 --> 24:23.959
I leave you !

24:24.268 --> 24:26.116
Your wing is better!

24:26.149 --> 24:28.910
Hula, yes, much better.

24:29.017 --> 24:31.270
And you, the baby!

24:31.469 --> 24:33.645
Pauline, she's at her parents' house.

24:33.828 --> 24:36.661
We found a way to
revolutionary transport.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.566
Much faster.

24:39.142 --> 24:40.409
It interests you ?

24:42.696 --> 24:46.640
You will see, it's simple, you
take a tree, a rope and hop

24:46.665 --> 24:48.363
directly to destination.

24:48.379 --> 24:50.903
Uh, it's not dangerous!

24:50.951 --> 24:54.923
Not at all, come on, put yourself there!

24:55.511 --> 24:57.463
- Like that!
- Here !

24:57.510 --> 24:59.724
Wow, then, it works!

24:59.756 --> 25:01.025
AH!

25:09.159 --> 25:12.887
And here it was, our first
piece, a baby to deliver

25:13.102 --> 25:14.989
Here is now our 2nd piece

25:15.053 --> 25:16.743
AH!

25:17.292 --> 25:18.736
Uh, are you ok?

25:18.808 --> 25:21.601
Obviously, I'm an actor,
it's a waterfall.

25:21.923 --> 25:24.993
- By the way, how was the show?
- Excuse me,

25:25.025 --> 25:28.024
We feel that the quality of the game is not
not the same between all the actors.

25:28.049 --> 25:30.857
- Please...
- If you liked my service,

25:30.882 --> 25:34.245
this summer I will play a piece
conceptual where I sit

25:34.294 --> 25:37.933
on a chimney and walled in
A deafening silence

25:37.974 --> 25:40.271
highlighting the anxiety
of this stork

25:40.280 --> 25:42.755
face to the emptiness of his existence!

25:43.081 --> 25:45.105
Yes, thanks, so ...

25:45.130 --> 25:47.742
I will be 12 in Mulhouse,
the 17th in Munster ....

25:47.816 --> 25:52.876
So, ladies and gentlemen,
the big bad fox.

25:53.306 --> 25:54.306
The big bad fox.

26:05.770 --> 26:06.770
Ooh!

26:34.292 --> 26:35.292
Hello !

26:36.544 --> 26:40.091
I warn you that today, if
you're messing up, you're tidying up!

26:46.470 --> 26:48.439
- Hello !
- It's okay !

26:50.662 --> 26:52.442
- A hand ?
- What do you mean !

26:58.813 --> 27:00.289
AH!

27:00.314 --> 27:02.513
Oh no, it's the 3rd
times this week.

27:02.577 --> 27:05.130
- That's enough !
- No, but, I'm hungry.

27:05.177 --> 27:06.177
I do not care.

27:09.456 --> 27:10.908
Ouch!

27:11.022 --> 27:14.093
Come back there kind of male
cracked, come back I tell you!

27:14.137 --> 27:18.016
- Take this !
- AH!

27:18.675 --> 27:20.785
You fall well, I come
to finish your basket.

27:21.032 --> 27:24.587
I especially put you turnips because
I had a good harvest.

27:24.678 --> 27:26.741
Do not hesitate to tell me
what you think!

27:26.941 --> 27:29.195
- Well, well, good evening.
- Hello !

27:33.936 --> 27:34.936
Hum!

27:44.293 --> 27:46.944
- So, my friend!
- So, nothing!

27:47.114 --> 27:49.181
- Nothing !
- Well, nothing,

27:49.464 --> 27:51.241
- Still, I did everything like you.
- That is to say ?

27:51.273 --> 27:54.678
You know the thing you do, grrr!

27:55.412 --> 27:57.078
- Your thing here!
 - Oh that.

27:57.126 --> 27:59.507
GRRR!

27:59.588 --> 28:01.961
That's it and it did not work!

28:03.077 --> 28:04.942
At this rate, we die of hunger.

28:04.974 --> 28:07.100
Why not you, it would be simpler!

28:07.126 --> 28:10.101
You go to the farm, you do your thing and
you bring us a plump chicken.

28:11.326 --> 28:15.088
Too dangerous, these idiots me
duck as soon as I approach.

28:15.620 --> 28:17.887
While you, you do not risk anything.

28:18.042 --> 28:20.422
Nothing, we see that the hen does not
you've never broken the face.

28:20.486 --> 28:23.049
If only you did a
a little effort to frighten him!

28:23.240 --> 28:24.477
It's not complicated !

28:24.502 --> 28:26.327
It's not my fault if
no one is afraid of me.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.005
Apparently, the thing that I can
scare is not born yet.

28:32.316 --> 28:36.164
Not born yet, diantre,
you are a genius !

28:36.455 --> 28:37.235
What?

28:37.434 --> 28:39.281
You are not able to
bring back a hen.

28:39.829 --> 28:41.908
But you can capture
the most harmless,

28:41.968 --> 28:45.235
the most naive and innocent
creatures.

28:45.712 --> 28:47.378
- A chicken ?
- No.

28:47.403 --> 28:49.704
A chick still in his egg!

28:50.116 --> 28:54.659
- Ah!
- Good night my angels.

29:18.927 --> 29:22.188
Thank you for throwing your garbage elsewhere.

29:26.046 --> 29:27.913
The wolf, you have to hide, fast!

29:36.619 --> 29:37.619
This way !

29:45.376 --> 29:48.661
BO .., wake up!

29:48.859 --> 29:52.573
- Wake up !
- Not right now, I sleep.

29:53.771 --> 29:55.612
My eggs are gone.

29:56.740 --> 29:58.311
Well, yes!

29:58.778 --> 30:00.095
They may be
went for a walk!

30:00.120 --> 30:03.758
No, it's the fox, go get it
and bring me back my eggs.

30:03.783 --> 30:06.592
Oh there, I have something else to do.

30:06.881 --> 30:09.484
You'll get them now!

30:09.492 --> 30:11.730
I did not even take
my breakfast.

30:13.326 --> 30:16.365
Let me at least take a shower.

30:16.571 --> 30:19.462
- Do not you want coffee too?
- No, I'm trying to stop.

30:34.887 --> 30:35.887
Hum!

30:49.698 --> 30:51.441
At table !

30:52.711 --> 30:54.266
- Mom !
- Huh!

30:54.322 --> 30:56.314
MOM !

30:56.394 --> 30:59.980
- How are you, mom?
- Mom !

31:01.810 --> 31:03.272
Leave me, not the muzzle!

31:03.296 --> 31:04.946
Hello Mom !

31:06.665 --> 31:09.212
Help !

31:10.275 --> 31:13.100
But that is not possible,
Hey, here you are!

31:14.023 --> 31:15.085
Is everything ok, my friend?

31:15.125 --> 31:16.839
I think I made a
Mishandling.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.947
They take me for their mother.

31:19.261 --> 31:20.994
Reassure yourself, it's normal.

31:21.068 --> 31:24.379
At birth, they consider the
first thing like their mother.

31:24.435 --> 31:28.030
- This thing is you.
- What, I do not want to be their mother.

31:28.094 --> 31:31.800
And why not, it's a detail,
we just have to eat them!

31:32.170 --> 31:35.559
- Mom !
- Yes, it's true !

31:36.818 --> 31:39.016
- Not now.
- Oh no.

31:40.912 --> 31:42.515
- Why not !
- Look at them

31:42.603 --> 31:45.476
They are not bigger than a
chestnut, wait a few months

31:45.532 --> 31:49.777
to fatten them up and we'll have
big fat chicks.

31:50.786 --> 31:53.374
A few months, but who will
to take care of them, meanwhile?

31:53.549 --> 31:55.602
- Well you!
- Me !

31:55.769 --> 31:59.903
Out of the question, it's your
idea, you take care of it.

32:00.014 --> 32:04.038
All because you are not able
to scare three little chicks.

32:04.562 --> 32:07.197
- Of course yes.
- Prove it to me.

32:08.676 --> 32:12.050
Right now, it's complicated,
give me a little time and you'll see.

32:12.074 --> 32:15.590
At the right time, I will iron
in some months.

32:15.640 --> 32:18.846
We'll see if you've become a
big bad fox.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.325
Drop it off !

32:29.331 --> 32:30.616
We sleep now.

32:30.640 --> 32:35.100
- A story, a story ....!
- You want me to surround you, too!

32:37.669 --> 32:42.336
- Yes N..... !
- It's okay, we calm down.

32:42.526 --> 32:45.542
Okay, so, once upon a time

32:45.598 --> 32:48.379
three little chicks that do not
did not want to go to sleep.

32:48.920 --> 32:51.035
Yet their mother told them,

32:51.099 --> 32:54.662
if you make noise, the big bad guy
Fox will come and eat you.

32:54.831 --> 32:59.219
But, the little chicks are
cheated and continued.

33:00.049 --> 33:07.265
So, the big bad fox
heard them and swallowed the first,

33:07.300 --> 33:11.192
Gobbled the second and devoured the third.

33:12.945 --> 33:20.480
And since then, we never have
saw the three little chicks again.

33:23.709 --> 33:26.169
Unable to scare them.

33:29.437 --> 33:30.837
What are you doing there ?

33:30.862 --> 33:33.151
We are afraid of the big bad fox.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.739
Go back to sleep in your basket.

33:35.842 --> 33:38.337
No, we want to sleep with mom.

33:38.544 --> 33:41.123
- I'm not your mom.
- We want mom

33:45.678 --> 33:47.559
I have good news for you.

33:47.645 --> 33:49.779
- You found the fox!
- Better than that !

33:49.852 --> 33:54.229
My eggs, my darlings, you are
my hero, where were they?

33:54.254 --> 33:55.920
There, in the thing .....

33:56.710 --> 33:58.977
Well, everything is fine that ends well.

33:59.999 --> 34:02.808
Um, you're sure they're mine!

34:02.834 --> 34:03.834
Yes on.

34:04.341 --> 34:06.579
You would not have them
found in a fridge?

34:06.699 --> 34:08.239
It's not right, it's not my style.

34:08.280 --> 34:12.415
So, tell me since I date the date
of expiry on my eggs?

34:12.978 --> 34:14.677
Oh yes, it's funny!

34:15.370 --> 34:19.632
I assure you, you react from
disproportionately!

34:32.237 --> 34:34.579
Mummy mummy !

34:34.746 --> 34:37.280
- Where are you ?
- There is no more mom here.

34:37.532 --> 34:41.083
Here is the big bad fox!

34:41.181 --> 34:46.547
So, tremble miserable because
I will unveil you!

34:48.810 --> 34:52.416
So, I said, I came to devour you.

34:52.670 --> 34:55.728
Again and again... !

34:56.031 --> 34:57.780
Do it again, mom!

34:57.805 --> 35:02.359
- Grrr, I'll eat you up!
- To me, I want to try!

35:02.416 --> 35:04.137
- Mom !
- What?

35:04.304 --> 35:06.771
Do you want to play dinette with me?

35:06.850 --> 35:12.351
- The dinette, and then what, again!
- Yes N !

35:12.673 --> 35:16.539
It's nice, today, Madam
the Duchess of Berciou!

35:16.773 --> 35:19.471
You will resume well
little tea, is not it!

35:20.446 --> 35:22.896
Madam, you are holding your
cup upside down!

35:24.041 --> 35:28.152
- That's correct.
- We saw the mean fox!

35:29.970 --> 35:32.738
How's the big bad guy
fox, it's impossible!

35:32.763 --> 35:35.163
If, as we have seen, he comes to eat us.

35:35.330 --> 35:37.627
- Hi my friend.
- Oh it's you !

35:37.666 --> 35:41.412
But no, it's not him
nasty fox!

35:41.443 --> 35:43.948
Do not be afraid,
he is only a wolf.

35:43.972 --> 35:45.839
He looks tall and mean.

35:46.036 --> 35:49.290
Big and nasty, but,
there is nothing in there.

35:49.329 --> 35:53.868
It's about me that you have to be afraid,
hold on, I'll break his face.

35:55.424 --> 35:56.979
We can talk to each other in private!

35:57.312 --> 36:00.787
- No way.
- Please !

36:00.809 --> 36:02.792
I will not pretend to be beaten.

36:03.063 --> 36:04.928
I have a reputation to hold, me!

36:04.988 --> 36:07.670
But, if you accept, they will think
that it's me, the mean fox.

36:07.695 --> 36:10.464
And why would I give you this service?

36:11.300 --> 36:14.180
Because .... you are my friend!

36:17.483 --> 36:20.446
- Do you see it now?
- I see nothing.

36:20.484 --> 36:23.547
There, look, the
big bad fox!

36:23.791 --> 36:27.632
Gre .., it's me the biggest and
the meanest fox.

36:27.697 --> 36:30.236
Lies, it's me ...

36:30.514 --> 36:32.914
It's me, the big bad fox!

36:32.982 --> 36:33.982
Mom !

36:34.076 --> 36:37.708
You will take the correction
that you deserve, take this!

36:37.765 --> 36:40.359
Teaser, butor, take this and that!

36:41.734 --> 36:44.068
You bow to power!

36:46.269 --> 36:50.260
- Mom beat him!
- Get me dirty camp ringworm!

36:51.352 --> 36:53.019
Finally, take your time!

37:02.640 --> 37:04.576
Is it really you, the mean fox?

37:04.624 --> 37:06.576
Yes it's me !

37:06.902 --> 37:10.500
So, that means we are
foxes, us too!

37:10.526 --> 37:11.128
Huh!

37:11.344 --> 37:15.457
You realize, we are the
children of the big bad fox!

37:15.482 --> 37:18.696
We are the most crackers
strong and the meanest.

37:18.721 --> 37:20.735
But no, you are chicks!

37:20.760 --> 37:23.561
Chicks, we eat them,
we devour them!

37:23.570 --> 37:26.434
You are chicks, you
must be afraid of me!

37:26.514 --> 37:28.831
But no, you are our mother.

37:29.125 --> 37:34.172
- We will never be afraid of you.
- That's enough, I do not want to see you anymore!

37:36.874 --> 37:38.469
- Mom !
- Mmmh!

37:38.842 --> 37:40.175
It's for you!

37:40.702 --> 37:43.979
Flowers, are the big ones
wicked foxes love flowers?

37:44.238 --> 37:46.563
- Uh no.
- So what !

38:01.120 --> 38:03.897
Mom, you are beautiful!

38:06.676 --> 38:07.676
Knock Knock knock !

38:07.748 --> 38:09.835
Hum, what is it?

38:10.905 --> 38:11.873
I have a request!

38:12.032 --> 38:15.789
Oh yes, if it's for the fox,
I'll take care of it....

38:15.937 --> 38:19.841
I do not come for that, sign
this authorization for my club.

38:19.866 --> 38:22.739
- Your club of what?
Extermination of the foxes.

38:22.925 --> 38:26.813
You are unable to defend us,
we will get rid of it ourselves.

38:26.908 --> 38:30.399
So, if I sign, you do not
ask nothing more.

38:30.499 --> 38:33.506
- That's the same.
- I support you 100%.

38:34.124 --> 38:37.465
I always thought that the car
defense is the way of the future.

38:39.271 --> 38:44.508
My dear friends, welcome to
fox extermination club.

38:44.539 --> 38:45.880
But, what are you doing here?

38:45.920 --> 38:48.893
- Well, meeting my club!
- Do it elsewhere!

38:48.925 --> 38:53.534
You just gave us your
okay, look at Article 3 paragraph 4.

38:53.574 --> 38:56.391
The dog's niche will serve as a platform
for club meetings.

38:56.743 --> 38:58.067
Enough time,

38:58.092 --> 39:03.163
in the program, list the defects
of our current watchdog.

39:03.441 --> 39:04.575
Who wants to start?

39:04.599 --> 39:08.003
Slack, incompetent ....

39:16.180 --> 39:18.092
This is me the biggest bad fox.

39:18.124 --> 39:20.552
- No it's me.
- It's me.

39:21.074 --> 39:25.007
Ah, I'm not the biggest,
but the most nasty.

39:25.364 --> 39:28.387
- But stop !
- The children, at the table!

39:30.321 --> 39:31.587
More turnips!

39:31.773 --> 39:34.760
But, foxes do not eat
turnips, but chicks.

39:34.872 --> 39:37.002
You will eat chicks when
The chickens will have teeth.

39:37.065 --> 39:38.707
- It's soon ?
- It's later !

39:38.756 --> 39:40.819
It's now
wants chicks.

39:41.311 --> 39:43.898
And here, a big chick well plump.

39:44.468 --> 39:46.769
It shows that this is
not a real chick.

39:46.793 --> 39:49.527
- He looks like you !
- That's not true.

39:49.536 --> 39:51.257
You look like a rotten chick.

39:51.266 --> 39:53.290
- No it's you !
- It's you !

39:53.315 --> 39:57.362
Listen, the only one that looks
to a fox, that's

39:57.387 --> 40:00.867
Me, and when I grow up,
I will be beautiful as mother.

40:00.982 --> 40:04.582
I will have a beautiful fur
and all fangs sharp.

40:04.623 --> 40:07.811
So, that's fine, because when
you will be great, you will be in my ....

40:09.549 --> 40:10.549
What will I be?

40:13.838 --> 40:15.678
Well, go for a ride, kids.

40:15.695 --> 40:17.988
Yeah!

40:19.683 --> 40:22.611
- Pass your way, rotten chick!
- What's going on yet?

40:22.770 --> 40:25.049
- Out of our way.
- Otherwise, you break your face.

40:25.064 --> 40:27.832
Te te te te, let Sir
Quiet wolf, children.

40:27.857 --> 40:29.506
Wolves are only
big poop bags.

40:29.531 --> 40:30.443
Go play somewhere else.

40:30.674 --> 40:32.816
Well, that's okay!

40:33.231 --> 40:34.825
Big poop bags!

40:35.072 --> 40:37.406
They do not think so!

40:38.081 --> 40:40.006
Who's afraid of the poop bag!

40:40.095 --> 40:42.107
It's not us ........

40:42.132 --> 40:45.473
My friend, it's high time to
enjoy these small poultry.

40:46.077 --> 40:48.961
What, now, but you said
to wait until they are big and fat.

40:48.986 --> 40:50.420
They are good enough.

40:50.476 --> 40:52.745
But, we can not eat them.

40:52.778 --> 40:53.897
- Why not ?
- because.....

40:53.922 --> 40:55.968
- Because ?
- Because they are sick.

40:55.992 --> 40:58.459
Sick, but they look good.

40:58.619 --> 41:00.491
But, we're not sick, Mom!

41:00.571 --> 41:04.524
La la, oh yes, I'm sick!

41:04.972 --> 41:08.817
See, come back tomorrow,
they will be healed.

41:11.382 --> 41:13.477
Children, in the
basket, we're going away.

41:15.735 --> 41:17.710
You are leaving, I thought
that they were sick

41:17.735 --> 41:19.679
Exactly, we were going to get some fresh air.

41:19.723 --> 41:21.452
Well, I'll come with you.

41:21.620 --> 41:23.484
Well, this ride was
nice, see you tomorrow!

41:23.844 --> 41:26.748
- What's going on, mom?
- It's Monsieur Wolf who annoys you?

41:26.852 --> 41:30.046
- Come on, we'll devour him.
- No, we do not devour anyone.

41:30.078 --> 41:31.958
Help me dig.

41:35.377 --> 41:38.520
Come, children, we have
dug quite far from the wolf.

41:42.544 --> 41:46.390
Come here, you would not try
not to rip off your old friend!

41:47.438 --> 41:49.525
Me, never of life.

41:50.158 --> 41:53.565
- No, wait, wait!
- I do not have your patience.

42:09.247 --> 42:12.675
- Where are we going, Mom?
- Mr. Wolf is angry.

42:14.196 --> 42:17.157
The only place he will come
never look for us.

42:18.652 --> 42:19.652
Hum!

42:22.658 --> 42:24.938
But, what do you want?

42:24.963 --> 42:27.668
- I'm a chicken ...
- You're not a chicken but a ..

42:28.685 --> 42:31.867
I'm a chicken and looking for
a refuge for my chicks.

42:32.053 --> 42:34.929
I would like to help you
but we are complete.

42:34.937 --> 42:39.350
Oh no, the wolf wants us
to devour, I beg you.

42:39.501 --> 42:43.508
Well, I'm fine, I'll see if there is any
someone's place!

42:43.587 --> 42:45.714
But, do not complain
if you are cramped.

42:45.722 --> 42:48.922
Thank you, here, at least, nobody
do not want my death.

42:51.574 --> 42:54.540
- Your chicks are charming.
- We are not pous .....

42:56.263 --> 42:59.583
I should have had chicks too,
they would be the same age as they are.

42:59.671 --> 43:02.867
But, it was not counting on
this fox sausage.

43:08.665 --> 43:10.665
- It's time.
- What?

43:10.919 --> 43:12.260
To go to school.

43:17.689 --> 43:19.600
We do not want to go to school.

43:19.608 --> 43:22.607
Listen, I'm a chicken,
you are chicks,

43:22.679 --> 43:24.616
so, you go to school as
all the little chicks.

43:24.625 --> 43:27.461
But, we are foxes,
we eat the chicks.

43:27.485 --> 43:30.517
Hush, you are
chicks, come on, zou!

43:31.372 --> 43:33.332
And do not eat your
little comrades.

43:33.888 --> 43:38.481
So, you're the new ones, well,
answer, I will not eat you.

43:41.524 --> 43:43.849
Come, I have to show you
Something.

43:44.465 --> 43:46.948
- Ready!
- Ready.

43:48.874 --> 43:52.072
Here is our heart of defense and
extermination of foxes.

43:52.103 --> 43:56.888
It aims to train hens to
to defend oneself and to slay foxes.

43:57.223 --> 43:59.134
We offer different types of activity,

43:59.182 --> 44:01.934
each of them develops
a different way

44:01.975 --> 44:03.508
to exterminate a fox.

44:06.263 --> 44:09.548
If you're interested, you
can benefit from 10%.

44:10.857 --> 44:13.658
Uh, yes, I'll think about it.

44:17.129 --> 44:18.104
Knock Knock knock.

44:18.232 --> 44:20.207
I'm coming very soon.

44:22.875 --> 44:24.256
Ah, it's you

44:24.433 --> 44:27.613
- Mom, we brought back to eat.
- Hello Madam !

44:27.875 --> 44:29.383
What are you doing with this chick?

44:29.423 --> 44:31.764
- Well, we'll eat it.
- He agree.

44:31.842 --> 44:34.223
We play fox
eat the chicks.

44:34.477 --> 44:37.599
We do not play, let go of this chick
and go home!

44:37.624 --> 44:39.457
- But Mom !
- No is no.

44:42.196 --> 44:43.463
Bye Madam !

44:44.298 --> 44:47.322
Children, we do not eat chicks.

44:47.404 --> 44:50.149
- We want to go back to the forest.
- we can not.

44:50.213 --> 44:52.513
- But why ?
- Because of the wolf.

44:52.656 --> 44:56.711
You're afraid of the wolf, since you're here,
you're just a wet hen.

44:56.768 --> 45:00.434
You are afraid of everything, of the forest,
wolf, chickens.

45:00.627 --> 45:03.372
We're tired of you, we
wants to live with the wolf.

45:03.507 --> 45:05.594
He, at least, is not afraid.

45:05.634 --> 45:09.775
So, go ahead, go live with him,
I'm sick of your whims.

45:09.807 --> 45:11.616
The wolf would leave us
to eat chicks.

45:11.688 --> 45:13.521
The wolf would eat you.

45:13.761 --> 45:15.411
Hmm, what?

45:16.419 --> 45:17.679
We have two words to tell you.

45:17.698 --> 45:19.332
It seems like your chicks, at school

45:19.357 --> 45:21.838
have tried to bite
some of their comrades.

45:21.886 --> 45:24.275
They tried to devour my Michel.

45:24.291 --> 45:26.274
- Hello Madam !
- But, no, finally I ...

45:26.299 --> 45:28.298
They say it's cool to be a fox

45:28.377 --> 45:34.964
- They threaten to devour.
- Down!

45:35.099 --> 45:38.833
Ladies, no violence
to one of our comrades!

45:38.939 --> 45:40.963
Keep your strength for the fox.

45:47.340 --> 45:49.974
So it was you from the beginning.

45:50.062 --> 45:53.618
And you strutted in front of
me with my ........

45:55.967 --> 45:57.379
my chicks.

45:57.487 --> 45:59.788
Children, where are you?

46:01.383 --> 46:03.845
- Where are they, where did you put them?
- What?

46:04.631 --> 46:06.725
- But, in the henhouse.
- They are not there.

46:07.369 --> 46:09.122
Impossible, I just talked to them.

46:09.466 --> 46:11.664
They were punished because they
wanted to go see the ...

46:11.974 --> 46:13.775
The what ?

46:13.968 --> 46:18.142
Mr. Wolf, where are you?

46:19.248 --> 46:22.303
Ah, Mr. Wolf, we
would like to change mom.

46:22.335 --> 46:26.409
Ours has become a wet chicken,
do you want to take care of us!

46:26.441 --> 46:28.726
With pleasure, children!

46:28.806 --> 46:32.472
- Do not do that, please.
- Where are they?

46:32.519 --> 46:35.376
In the forest, they are
went to see the wolf.

46:35.409 --> 46:38.011
You think I'm pretty stupid
to swallow that.

46:39.793 --> 46:43.625
If he told the truth, if he wanted them
to devour, it would already be done, no!

46:44.265 --> 46:47.377
Trust him, he'll go
find your chicks.

46:47.426 --> 46:50.043
And after that, we'll be done
with all these stories.

46:50.091 --> 46:52.145
You think it's not worth it!

46:52.181 --> 46:52.866
The wick!

46:52.891 --> 46:56.215
Do not worry, do not you see
I'm trying to save your life!

46:56.240 --> 46:59.812
- BOOM!
- AH!

46:59.983 --> 47:01.450
Well, I would have tried!

47:02.529 --> 47:03.773
You know, Mr Wolf,

47:03.798 --> 47:06.157
we know a place filled
chicks and hens.

47:06.285 --> 47:08.647
If we went there to devour them!

47:08.680 --> 47:12.972
We'll go, but before that,
I have something to do.

47:12.997 --> 47:14.711
What are you going to do ?

47:14.790 --> 47:16.417
Open the appetite.

47:16.442 --> 47:19.393
- Ah!
- Mom !

47:20.194 --> 47:22.543
Save yourself before the
Wolf does not catch you.

47:22.591 --> 47:23.991
He wants to devour you.

47:26.421 --> 47:29.063
Mom, help, mom!

47:29.191 --> 47:31.197
- Give them back to me!
- GRR ...

47:31.586 --> 47:33.713
- Give me back my children!
- Your children?

47:33.800 --> 47:37.475
These are not your children, you have them
Stolen in the hen to devour them!

47:37.500 --> 47:40.904
You remember, devour simple
chicks, you can not do it.

47:41.096 --> 47:44.674
Look how pathetic he is
your big bad fox!

47:44.695 --> 47:48.172
He is not able to devour you
and even less to save you.

47:48.229 --> 47:51.030
- Mom !
- Say goodbye to your mom.

47:55.473 --> 47:58.163
Run away, children, go!

48:01.233 --> 48:02.669
Leave them!

48:03.188 --> 48:04.101
- No !

48:04.149 --> 48:08.789
It's enough of you and your whims,
it's time to finish.

48:08.806 --> 48:09.806
Excuse me !

48:12.024 --> 48:14.714
Did you try to
to eat my chicks?

48:14.824 --> 48:18.446
Chickens everywhere, a real feast!

48:18.478 --> 48:19.359
We are doomed.

48:19.438 --> 48:23.365
I repeat, did you have
tried to eat my chicks?

48:23.381 --> 48:24.381
Myself !

48:24.786 --> 48:28.083
And I'm going to skip the entry for
go to the main course.

48:28.124 --> 48:29.813
Do not annoy him especially!

48:29.854 --> 48:31.393
Get away, children!

48:31.477 --> 48:33.683
Mom will break the figure
to the ugly sir.

48:33.826 --> 48:34.651
Sorry !

48:34.850 --> 48:36.024
We go, girls!

48:44.240 --> 48:45.640
Well, I'm going to leave.

48:46.129 --> 48:47.803
To attack !

48:47.978 --> 48:50.900
Infernal picking technique.

48:52.750 --> 48:54.377
Wow!

48:57.788 --> 48:59.351
Go girls !

49:00.024 --> 49:02.224
Send it as far as possible.

49:03.079 --> 49:04.079
Children!

49:04.199 --> 49:06.675
- The children!
- We are here.

49:06.925 --> 49:08.037
Children!

49:09.879 --> 49:12.740
I am so happy
to find you

49:12.851 --> 49:15.708
So, are you our mom?

49:15.884 --> 49:20.312
Of course, it's always been me.

49:24.098 --> 49:25.875
You're still the !

49:28.544 --> 49:30.170
But, I would just like them
say goodbye !

49:30.195 --> 49:32.265
No way, go away.

49:39.005 --> 49:40.538
Goodbye, children.

49:58.965 --> 50:01.020
Maybe we can
Find an arrangement !

50:01.359 --> 50:03.986
We'll find one, arrangement!

50:07.801 --> 50:11.999
- GRRR!
- Yah, wow!

50:12.405 --> 50:14.648
- It was good ?
- Excellent.

50:14.792 --> 50:17.550
The catch was good, the
throw, a little soft.

50:17.678 --> 50:21.900
I remember, we must understand the
two feet and a remote-shifted

50:22.025 --> 50:23.427
to flatten it to the ground.

50:23.435 --> 50:25.657
In case of aggression, you can
also grab the ears.

50:25.689 --> 50:29.972
Above all, the simplest is to catch
directly the tail and then ...

50:31.917 --> 50:34.050
Well, it's over for today

50:34.122 --> 50:36.844
Tomorrow, bring back your boxing gloves.

50:36.896 --> 50:39.340
- It's good, we can go.
- Yes it's good.

50:42.717 --> 50:45.764
- Mom !
- The children!

50:45.994 --> 50:48.470
- Was it good, school?
- Yes !

50:48.526 --> 50:51.066
- You did not bite anyone?
- No.

50:51.336 --> 50:53.869
- Good.
- So, we can go play.

50:54.188 --> 50:56.267
- Bring them back for dinner!
- Yes.

50:56.315 --> 50:58.515
- What are we playing!
- To the wolf and the hen.

50:58.546 --> 51:00.719
And now, everything is good that ends well.

51:00.807 --> 51:04.481
He teaches you to defend yourself against
the foxes and he sees his chicks.

51:04.506 --> 51:08.685
Yeah, let's say I would have preferred
a less amateur fox.

51:08.917 --> 51:12.877
I'm sure he does the trick,
what's next with him?

51:12.960 --> 51:15.206
It will help us settle
catapults to fox.

51:15.262 --> 51:17.915
Oh yes, it must be damn
love them these chicks.

51:18.098 --> 51:19.780
Now that he is happy!

51:19.836 --> 51:21.281
What should not be
to be happy.

51:29.841 --> 51:33.805
We are already coming to our last
piece, we must save Christmas.

51:33.838 --> 51:36.528
- Bye Madam !
- Bye, Michelle, see you tomorrow.

51:36.576 --> 51:38.794
This is our last show!

51:38.819 --> 51:40.485
Look where you brought the show!

51:40.667 --> 51:42.903
Michelle, you annoy the audience.

51:42.928 --> 51:45.166
They want to eat me but I'm starving

51:45.254 --> 51:48.055
- It's theater.
- Can someone pick up Michelle?

51:48.166 --> 51:49.721
Uh, I'll take care of it, if you want.

51:49.761 --> 51:52.822
No, I'm fine, I do not want to disturb you.

51:52.846 --> 51:54.084
It does not bother me.

51:54.187 --> 51:57.321
That's good, look, she's gone.

51:58.131 --> 52:01.478
Well, since we do not need to
me, if he comes back, do not hesitate!

52:01.503 --> 52:02.774
Goodbye everyone !

52:02.814 --> 52:05.710
Yes, I will tell you .....

52:06.171 --> 52:09.781
Ladies, gentlemen, our
last piece, we must save Christmas.

52:18.750 --> 52:20.448
Ah!

53:22.969 --> 53:26.231
♫ la la ♫

53:26.412 --> 53:29.491
♫ la la ♫

53:30.020 --> 53:33.138
♫ la la ♫

53:33.409 --> 53:36.885
♫ la la ♫

53:38.454 --> 53:39.454
Merry Christmas !

53:39.835 --> 53:42.375
Thank you, but Christmas is tomorrow.

53:42.415 --> 53:45.692
Tonight, there is Santa Claus passing by.

53:46.042 --> 53:47.835
You realize, Santa Claus!

53:47.891 --> 53:49.550
Yes it's good.

53:49.677 --> 53:53.092
And if you were going to make a man
of snow, meanwhile.

53:53.267 --> 53:54.894
A snowman !

53:55.660 --> 53:56.913
Ah ah ah!

53:57.255 --> 53:58.564
Real kids!

53:58.636 --> 54:02.032
It's you who has the Christmas decorations,
I need something that slams.

54:02.136 --> 54:04.323
You know they believe
again to Santa Claus!

54:04.348 --> 54:06.069
You talk about two idiots
who are on your roof.

54:09.190 --> 54:10.697
But, what are you doing, stop!

54:10.705 --> 54:12.451
We recover the snow for
to do the guy.

54:12.523 --> 54:14.221
But not on my roof!

54:16.611 --> 54:16.571
Well, no one has walked
on it, it is all clean.

54:16.611 --> 54:19.444
- Come down, it's dangerous.
- Okay.

54:20.095 --> 54:21.722
Can you help me down,
please !

54:21.916 --> 54:24.558
- Go ahead.
- Ouch!

54:31.288 --> 54:34.129
- But it's not true !
- It was not on purpose.

54:34.201 --> 54:37.502
- With all the snow on the ground.
- Yes, but it's less clean.

54:37.539 --> 54:42.237
So, we have the snow, we miss it
nose, arms, knees.

54:42.261 --> 54:43.903
The TV antenna will be perfect for the arms.

54:43.928 --> 54:45.197
- Oh yeah.
- Stop!

54:45.229 --> 54:47.845
Tree branches will go very
good for a snowman.

54:48.029 --> 54:51.020
Yeah, you always have good ideas.

54:52.886 --> 54:55.219
Why do you care
of these two imbeciles?

54:55.243 --> 54:57.275
But no, I'm watching them.

54:57.407 --> 55:00.287
- We never know.
- Let them fend for themselves.

55:00.433 --> 55:02.218
Well, protect them.

55:02.243 --> 55:04.599
You do not protect them,
you cover them.

55:04.894 --> 55:06.203
They will never grow up.

55:06.322 --> 55:07.989
Oh, you always exaggerate.

55:12.311 --> 55:14.351
But why ?

55:14.913 --> 55:17.179
Ben, to recover this branch.

55:18.159 --> 55:19.722
Leave me alone.

55:20.269 --> 55:22.626
And do not approach your cabin.

55:24.889 --> 55:27.365
- Do you want help to repair?
- No.

55:28.969 --> 55:29.969
He is angry.

55:31.107 --> 55:33.376
But still, his
Roof was a little worn.

55:33.583 --> 55:35.583
Above all, he is likely!

55:37.025 --> 55:39.794
And if, from now on, we
became responsible adults!

55:39.874 --> 55:42.123
- You are right.
- No more rounds, kids.

55:42.148 --> 55:43.004
Yeah!

55:43.084 --> 55:45.084
- Snowmen, finished!
 Even the sledge?

55:45.124 --> 55:47.449
Even the sledge, the age of
reason has arrived.

55:47.509 --> 55:50.191
- Santa !
- Santa Claus, it's over.

55:50.261 --> 55:52.482
- No, Santa Claus up there!
- What?

55:53.677 --> 55:57.166
Santa Claus is stuck
we must help him!

55:57.191 --> 55:58.966
Yes but how !

56:00.459 --> 56:03.121
Hold on, Mr. Christmas, I'm coming!

56:06.190 --> 56:07.257
Do not panic !

56:10.092 --> 56:11.092
Here!

56:17.514 --> 56:19.894
Sir, Christmas, how are you?

56:20.030 --> 56:24.655
- But what did we do?
- I think we killed Santa Claus!

56:39.624 --> 56:40.758
What are you doing ?

56:41.162 --> 56:44.312
We, nothing!

56:45.172 --> 56:47.592
Yeah, I see you're trying
to hide something.

56:47.637 --> 56:50.454
Not at all, we unblock the snow.

56:52.361 --> 56:55.710
You move the snow,
well then !

57:00.937 --> 57:04.797
I know you made a mistake
and do not say the opposite!

57:04.907 --> 57:10.271
Not at all, uh, we got
do a big mistake!

57:10.309 --> 57:12.192
We killed Santa Claus!

57:17.541 --> 57:19.938
Ah, ah, ah!

57:20.970 --> 57:23.570
But, it's a plastic Santa Claus!

57:24.073 --> 57:25.708
You did not kill anything.

57:28.272 --> 57:30.279
They are cute !

57:31.779 --> 57:33.151
- Hold on !
- Mmm!

57:33.160 --> 57:36.246
We too had trouble
accept it, but it is so.

57:36.634 --> 57:38.754
Thousands of children will be
private gifts!

57:38.890 --> 57:40.090
They are sad !

57:41.287 --> 57:42.887
They are heartbroken!

57:45.984 --> 57:48.115
I know what we will do, we
will replace Santa

57:48.140 --> 57:50.464
and distribute gifts
to the whole world

57:50.489 --> 57:52.279
so that the Christmas spirit does not
do not die this night!

57:52.304 --> 57:53.986
Yes that's it !

57:54.096 --> 57:56.405
We need someone
to play Santa Claus!

57:56.489 --> 57:57.750
Someone very plump.

57:57.775 --> 58:01.258
With good cheeks, a complexion
pink and a jovial look!

58:01.580 --> 58:04.341
That's enough, I do not have the
time to play with you.

58:04.707 --> 58:06.793
I have a roof to repair,
you remember !

58:06.818 --> 58:08.468
Well, what, it's the costume
that bothers you!

58:08.857 --> 58:10.261
You should do the goblin.

58:10.460 --> 58:13.673
All right, then, I'm going
to do Santa Claus!

58:13.740 --> 58:17.001
- Go ahead, do it!
- I can do the goblin!

58:28.013 --> 58:31.290
Um, you know where I can find
the blue garlands!

58:31.374 --> 58:33.564
Uh, yes, in the shed.

58:33.701 --> 58:37.063
Tell me, should not we
to watch the rabbit and the duck?

58:37.088 --> 58:37.745
No.

58:37.857 --> 58:40.420
- You do not think that ....
- No.

58:41.027 --> 58:43.194
- Or just the ...
- No more.

58:43.281 --> 58:45.899
- Thank you for your advice.
- You're welcome.

58:49.376 --> 58:52.297
- There you go.
- You would not have fattened!

58:52.546 --> 58:54.014
Looks like that
Bullfight a little.

58:54.023 --> 58:56.300
And what are you doing with
this thing on the head?

58:56.781 --> 58:58.312
It's my elf hat!

58:59.114 --> 59:01.135
Since when do elves wear
feathered hats?

59:01.373 --> 59:02.643
Yes of course !

59:02.992 --> 59:04.523
Wait, I have other models.

59:05.216 --> 59:06.216
Here !

59:11.798 --> 59:12.798
This is not good.

59:13.354 --> 59:14.354
No more.

59:14.592 --> 59:15.592
Bof!

59:18.963 --> 59:19.963
Stop!

59:20.011 --> 59:21.734
Come back, again!

59:21.995 --> 59:22.995
Perfect.

59:26.500 --> 59:27.767
So, the itinerary!

59:28.151 --> 59:30.642
Departure point, the farm.

59:30.841 --> 59:33.444
- And for the destination?
- Every household in the world.

59:33.501 --> 59:34.834
And checkmark without toll.

59:36.020 --> 59:39.678
Houla, it's a 12-year journey,
7 months, 120 days and 32 minutes.

59:39.780 --> 59:43.080
In one night, put only
homes with good children!

59:44.088 --> 59:47.245
Ah, yes, it's shorter,
7 years, 6 months and 11 minutes.

59:47.500 --> 59:49.847
- They always exaggerate.
- I print.

59:49.974 --> 59:52.283
Great, we only have to
make the sled.

59:55.133 --> 59:56.743
I can borrow a wrench!

59:56.902 --> 59:58.561
It is to boost the engine
of the lawn mower.

59:58.593 --> 01:00:01.399
Yes, go ahead, her name is back.

01:00:03.042 --> 01:00:06.283
Lawn mower, lawn mower, te ...

01:00:06.318 --> 01:00:09.585
And fuchsias, do we have
garlands fuchsias?

01:00:09.699 --> 01:00:10.999
Did you hear what he said?

01:00:11.078 --> 01:00:13.253
- They will do something stupid!
- Let him do it.

01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:15.173
I'm talking to you about something important!

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:17.422
But, it's important,
they will hurt themselves.

01:00:17.454 --> 01:00:20.652
If you get involved, it's you who
will have pain, leave them.

01:00:20.677 --> 01:00:24.367
But, there is something to worry about,
we talk about lawnmowers!

01:00:24.392 --> 01:00:28.058
The worry is in you,
the solution is in them.

01:00:28.328 --> 01:00:29.995
- In them ?
- Of course.

01:00:30.122 --> 01:00:32.122
- You do not know.
- Here.

01:00:32.542 --> 01:00:35.009
- I let them grow.
- That's it.

01:00:35.113 --> 01:00:37.359
And what do we do for
garlands fuchsias?

01:00:38.769 --> 01:00:41.864
And now, a beautiful sled.

01:00:42.007 --> 01:00:44.284
Yes, the Christmas spirit
just have to stand.

01:00:48.294 --> 01:00:50.802
Hey, maybe something needs to be done!

01:00:50.857 --> 01:00:52.174
But no.

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:54.391
- It looks like she's broken.
- Wait, I'll fix it.

01:00:54.821 --> 01:00:57.931
- This piece is useless.
- Go ahead to see.

01:01:00.394 --> 01:01:03.251
- There, it's really dangerous.
- Leave them, they learn.

01:01:03.759 --> 01:01:05.512
And if we put gas!

01:01:08.194 --> 01:01:10.710
- Do you think it's full?
- It's too dark.

01:01:10.758 --> 01:01:14.424
- Wait, I have matches.
- It's not possible !

01:01:14.531 --> 01:01:16.459
Give me this can and
loose the matches.

01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:17.507
(Explosion)

01:01:23.145 --> 01:01:24.700
You are stubborn!

01:02:10.336 --> 01:02:13.700
Why everything you do
turns into disaster?

01:02:13.812 --> 01:02:16.734
Do not worry, I have the
situation well in hand.

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:19.512
I will speak to the gentleman
and everything will work out.

01:02:22.683 --> 01:02:26.064
You fall well, this is
a terrible mistake!

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:29.236
Let me explain,
you make a mistake.

01:02:29.808 --> 01:02:31.069
Do you know who I am ?

01:02:31.219 --> 01:02:33.917
I will not let myself go!

01:02:35.243 --> 01:02:36.996
Uh, please!

01:02:37.073 --> 01:02:40.009
Guys, the Christmas meal has arrived.

01:02:40.251 --> 01:02:41.551
At table !

01:02:41.631 --> 01:02:43.411
Wait, you can not do that.

01:02:43.436 --> 01:02:45.078
Oh really? Why ?

01:02:45.316 --> 01:02:48.420
Uh, because I'm Santa

01:02:48.768 --> 01:02:52.742
and if you eat us, children
will have no gifts tonight.

01:02:52.767 --> 01:02:55.679
Ah, ah ah!

01:02:55.704 --> 01:02:56.552
The other there!

01:02:56.595 --> 01:02:58.690
- AH!
- No !

01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:01.071
Dad, I want to receive my gifts.

01:03:01.265 --> 01:03:03.193
Do not eat Santa Claus!

01:03:03.486 --> 01:03:07.398
Finally, sweetie, you see that
it's not the real Santa Claus!

01:03:07.468 --> 01:03:10.587
But if he has a red cap
and a white beard.

01:03:10.644 --> 01:03:12.524
The truth always comes out of
the mouths of children.

01:03:13.231 --> 01:03:14.897
The rabbit, we can eat it!

01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:18.047
Oh no, I need my elf
to distribute the gifts.

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.566
If he needs it!

01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:21.988
So, the pig, it is useless!

01:03:22.032 --> 01:03:23.658
- It's not false.
- But!

01:03:23.937 --> 01:03:27.908
But, not at all, I
am very helpful, i ....

01:03:28.083 --> 01:03:29.686
I'm the one pulling the sled

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.412
And guys, is not it
reindeer work?

01:03:32.468 --> 01:03:36.466
Yes, but it's the crisis, so, the
reindeer .... it has become too expensive.

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.388
While pigs, not at all.

01:03:38.431 --> 01:03:42.952
If he pulls the sled, then he does not
do not eat it, eh dad!

01:03:50.054 --> 01:03:51.054
Okay !

01:03:53.236 --> 01:03:58.085
If you help us out, the
kids are waiting for their presents.

01:03:59.113 --> 01:04:02.375
Ah ah ah .....

01:04:02.394 --> 01:04:06.861
You are nice, if there was a
mean, we would already be outside!

01:04:08.586 --> 01:04:09.586
I have an idea !

01:04:09.967 --> 01:04:12.834
The pig can fly
above the fence

01:04:12.898 --> 01:04:14.725
and go get the keys to the paddock.

01:04:14.734 --> 01:04:16.448
Fly away?

01:04:16.543 --> 01:04:19.162
It's you who pulls the
Santa's sleigh !

01:04:19.225 --> 01:04:22.724
- So, fly!
- Or, we can eat you.

01:04:22.954 --> 01:04:26.961
Fly, but without sled,
it will be complicated!

01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:28.874
- But no !
- AH!

01:04:30.308 --> 01:04:34.474
- Look, dad, he's flying.
- Yeah, he falls, especially.

01:04:35.292 --> 01:04:37.791
Thin, he fell into
the big Dudu pen.

01:04:37.903 --> 01:04:40.140
You will see that it is he who will
nibble at my place.

01:04:40.466 --> 01:04:43.545
Nice, nice, ouch ....

01:04:45.994 --> 01:04:47.147
He wants to play with!

01:04:47.219 --> 01:04:49.385
He managed to fly over the fence.

01:04:49.846 --> 01:04:51.790
Yes, but Dede too!

01:04:52.262 --> 01:04:53.796
They are heading towards us!

01:04:58.282 --> 01:05:02.229
Open me!

01:05:08.631 --> 01:05:10.013
You managed to open the door!

01:05:17.795 --> 01:05:19.728
And here we are free.

01:05:19.873 --> 01:05:22.841
Now, we have to save Christmas,
are you ready to help us?

01:05:23.017 --> 01:05:27.151
- Oh yes !
- Oh no !

01:05:28.047 --> 01:05:30.158
Oh yeah !

01:05:30.579 --> 01:05:33.404
But, of course, darling,
we will save Christmas!

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.095
So, you have to find the most
gifts to distribute to children.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.477
Yeah!

01:05:38.802 --> 01:05:41.668
- I'm going for a sled!
- Yeah!

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:45.310
- I found it !
- Yeah!

01:05:45.389 --> 01:05:47.540
Come on, let's go dad!

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:49.693
But yes, sweetie.

01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:52.263
Lets' go !

01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:41.153
I think that's the
time to slip away!

01:06:41.202 --> 01:06:45.669
So, that's moving forward, otherwise we can
you find another use!

01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:49.777
The beautiful gift, there are some
are going to be spoiled this year.

01:06:50.021 --> 01:06:52.481
It'll make them happy, all that!

01:06:52.752 --> 01:06:55.537
We can be proud, we have never
had a Christmas so beautiful.

01:06:56.664 --> 01:06:59.354
That's it, the sled is ready,
we will be able to deliver!

01:06:59.442 --> 01:07:02.018
We will not deliver anything at all
return to the farm discreetly.

01:07:02.074 --> 01:07:04.168
But the children are waiting for Santa Claus!

01:07:04.177 --> 01:07:05.524
But, it will not start again!

01:07:05.612 --> 01:07:09.453
Santa Claus does not exist, they are
stories told to kids.

01:07:11.685 --> 01:07:14.025
Dad, that's right
what does the pig say?

01:07:14.218 --> 01:07:17.003
Come on, we have gifts to deliver.

01:07:17.093 --> 01:07:19.330
He will not fly
all alone, the sled.

01:07:23.156 --> 01:07:27.195
Thank you, friends, thanks to you,
we saved Christmas!

01:07:27.304 --> 01:07:29.375
Bravo!

01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:33.145
- Bravo!
- Oh, yes, congratulations!

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.607
Thank you !

01:07:36.846 --> 01:07:38.303
Merry Christmas !

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:42.572
Merry Christmas !

01:07:50.601 --> 01:07:52.418
Here, he steals!

01:08:13.536 --> 01:08:16.250
My darling, you are beautiful,
in this costume!

01:08:16.471 --> 01:08:18.542
What's hot in this thing?

01:08:18.837 --> 01:08:20.645
Fortunately I do not
only once a year.

01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:23.209
Here, the hat!

01:08:24.161 --> 01:08:26.094
The kids are impatient!

01:08:26.367 --> 01:08:28.875
I tell you there are many Santa Claus!

01:08:29.287 --> 01:08:30.502
Whatever.

01:08:30.604 --> 01:08:35.424
If, it is obliged, if it must deliver the
gifts to all children the same night,

01:08:35.443 --> 01:08:39.109
they must be at least five!

01:08:39.124 --> 01:08:41.821
But, he's too strong, that's all!

01:08:41.837 --> 01:08:43.477
Maybe, but still!

01:08:43.502 --> 01:08:44.984
We will ask him.

01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:48.277
Children, guess who has just arrived!

01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:51.810
Well, we have the presents, a chimney,
the children are waiting for us!

01:08:51.843 --> 01:08:54.764
You're crazy, you're not going
not go down there.

01:08:55.162 --> 01:08:57.337
You think it's the
children going to ride?

01:08:57.353 --> 01:08:58.462
Congratulations the spirit of Christmas!

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:02.118
But, if the chimney is clogged,
you will be stuck

01:09:02.834 --> 01:09:04.928
You're right, go first
to unclog it.

01:09:04.966 --> 01:09:06.609
Oh yes, go ahead!

01:09:06.871 --> 01:09:09.596
If all goes well, type 3 times
on the wall and we arrive.

01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:14.117
Merry Christmas, children!

01:09:18.937 --> 01:09:20.580
Darling, go get me the broom.

01:09:22.872 --> 01:09:26.245
Guys, you have to get me out of here!

01:09:26.558 --> 01:09:29.104
It's the signal, the way is free, hop!

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.810
Merry Christmas !

01:09:33.241 --> 01:09:35.573
You will see what you will take!

01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:41.395
I do not know if there is
several Santa Claus!

01:09:41.728 --> 01:09:43.939
Oh yes, and the other, what is it for?

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.765
I do not know, he pulls the sled.

01:09:45.791 --> 01:09:47.925
Is it not the reindeer
who pull the sled?

01:09:47.952 --> 01:09:49.885
Pigs are cheaper.

01:09:55.464 --> 01:09:56.869
Did I miss something ?

01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:02.625
AH!

01:10:06.937 --> 01:10:08.897
Well, it's not bad, for a start!

01:10:09.183 --> 01:10:13.104
- Whew, we continue!
- No, we stop the nonsense.

01:10:13.184 --> 01:10:15.477
The distribution of gifts
is finished.

01:10:15.774 --> 01:10:18.742
- Santa !
- Santa Claus is ter_mi_né.

01:10:18.973 --> 01:10:20.972
No, but up there!

01:10:22.948 --> 01:10:25.249
He is stuck, quick, you have to help him.

01:10:25.579 --> 01:10:27.285
Yes, but, be responsible!

01:10:29.301 --> 01:10:32.124
There is no Santa Claus.

01:10:32.418 --> 01:10:34.632
Wait, that can not
not be Santa Claus.

01:10:34.994 --> 01:10:35.922
They understood !

01:10:35.962 --> 01:10:39.184
It's a replacement, we have
killed the truth this morning.

01:10:39.248 --> 01:10:40.514
Finally, you killed him.

01:10:40.787 --> 01:10:43.612
It's not me, it's gravity,
he was drawn to the ground.

01:10:44.177 --> 01:10:47.939
Stop, you did not kill anyone,
it was a plastic Santa Claus.

01:10:47.964 --> 01:10:49.503
like this one !

01:10:49.742 --> 01:10:51.218
And that's also plastic!

01:10:56.372 --> 01:10:57.641
What is this ?

01:10:57.793 --> 01:11:00.817
Eho, you come help me!

01:11:01.056 --> 01:11:02.896
I will not take long!

01:11:03.429 --> 01:11:05.587
- Plastic!
- Hold on, I'm coming!

01:11:09.616 --> 01:11:10.616
I hold it !

01:11:14.314 --> 01:11:17.242
Do not panic, I have the
situation well in hands.

01:11:22.654 --> 01:11:25.535
- There you go !
- Whew, it was less one.

01:11:25.758 --> 01:11:27.315
I do not understand what happened,

01:11:27.331 --> 01:11:30.450
I was coming out of a chimney when
there was an explosion.

01:11:30.469 --> 01:11:33.016
It looked like a trolley
supermarket.

01:11:34.406 --> 01:11:36.941
A trolley on a roof,
I have too much imagination.

01:11:37.188 --> 01:11:42.694
Thank you, I do not know what you
did, you saved my life.

01:11:42.853 --> 01:11:45.527
And most importantly, you saved Christmas.

01:11:49.893 --> 01:11:53.754
That's not all, I have
a tour to finish.

01:11:53.804 --> 01:11:55.364
Come on, we have to go.

01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:58.091
Wait, you are the real Santa Claus.

01:11:58.643 --> 01:12:00.436
Of course, who do you want me to be?

01:12:00.476 --> 01:12:04.492
No, it's that, I saw you more ...

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.787
How to say, more ....

01:12:07.969 --> 01:12:10.569
You have to go through the chimneys!

01:12:11.003 --> 01:12:13.367
Well, I'll drop you off!

01:12:18.384 --> 01:12:21.201
I was wondering, reindeer,
it does not cost too much?

01:12:21.226 --> 01:12:25.253
Sure, it's a budget, but, we
use it from one year to another.

01:12:25.391 --> 01:12:27.724
- Of course.
- I can drive ?

01:12:29.216 --> 01:12:32.473
Look at the
landscape, it's pretty!

01:12:32.777 --> 01:12:34.443
Ah, yes, it's pretty.

01:12:46.309 --> 01:12:47.309
Wow!

01:13:26.192 --> 01:13:28.326
- Merry Christmas !
- Merry Christmas !

01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:34.278
What are all these gifts!

01:13:34.303 --> 01:13:35.754
It's Santa Claus!

01:13:35.977 --> 01:13:38.348
Do not tell me that you believe,
you too, to those idiots!

01:13:38.563 --> 01:13:40.325
Now you know !

01:13:40.344 --> 01:13:44.322
- Buoy !
- Me, a carrot peeler.

01:13:44.481 --> 01:13:45.775
I have to find a carrot.

01:13:46.067 --> 01:13:48.558
Oh there, two real kids.

01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:51.442
The important thing is that all
world finds happiness.

01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:09.492

01:14:50.282 --> 01:14:53.012
We forgot the salvation, we go back,
