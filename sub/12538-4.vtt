WEBVTT

00:03.402 --> 00:05.042
Previously on Rogue...

00:05.065 --> 00:06.780
Cheat never partied alone.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.678
You need to find out who was here with him.

00:08.690 --> 00:10.942
Yeah, if they're still alive.

00:11.062 --> 00:13.377
No, I don't think that's Sarah.

00:13.389 --> 00:14.962
Who else knew about the money?

00:15.082 --> 00:17.329
Maybe Cheat flashed
some cash to some hooker.

00:17.368 --> 00:19.380
What, she kills him and
makes it look like an OD?

00:19.402 --> 00:21.426
That doesn't explain the bullet holes.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.122
Now that's Sarah.

00:23.914 --> 00:25.785
So whoever came late to the party...

00:25.805 --> 00:27.305
They find her,

00:28.341 --> 00:29.541
and all hell breaks loose.

00:29.591 --> 00:30.991
Kendra Willis.

00:31.383 --> 00:33.116
Her DNA was all over Cheat's body.

00:33.216 --> 00:35.378
- Yeah, I knew it.
- Yeah, I'm going to pick her up.

00:35.876 --> 00:39.353
There's more. The blood by
the water... it's Sarah's.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.627
Kendra's dead.

00:41.747 --> 00:43.147
You sure it was an execution?

00:43.633 --> 00:46.106
- Yeah.
- Then it is Massoud, no doubt about it.

00:46.206 --> 00:48.570
Why don't you move your
families. Put them in a hotel.

00:48.670 --> 00:51.610
- Downtown, somewhere safe.
- That was my source at the Pentagon.

00:51.710 --> 00:54.077
Ethan Kelly and his buddies
were working private security

00:54.077 --> 00:55.518
based out of Karachi, Pakistan.

00:55.539 --> 00:57.237
We have to send someone in.

00:57.487 --> 00:58.687
Will you do it?

00:58.943 --> 01:00.511
You want to find Sarah?

01:01.167 --> 01:02.567
You go in after her.

01:44.943 --> 01:48.613
And that was some smooth groove
for you there, Carson City.

01:48.713 --> 01:53.088
It's going to be a warm 71 degrees
down down here in Eagle Valley.

01:53.188 --> 01:57.728
And if you're lucky enough to take the day
off, you just head out on to the Lincoln...

02:19.438 --> 02:20.838
Hey!

02:21.583 --> 02:22.983
Hey!

02:26.095 --> 02:27.651
Why do you keep coming around here?

02:29.814 --> 02:31.072
Stop! Stop!

02:31.172 --> 02:32.572
I want to talk to you!

02:49.500 --> 02:51.754
I've never seen someone reach
for a light switch so fast.

02:51.779 --> 02:54.605
Oh yeah? That's right, I forgot
that 9 in your belt was ornamental.

02:54.693 --> 02:55.993
It's been 6 days.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.650
You think I moved my family into a hotel

02:57.668 --> 02:59.653
because I like finding
strange hairs on my pillow?

02:59.689 --> 03:03.031
Just to be clear, your working theory
is that he tracked us from a desert,

03:03.093 --> 03:05.153
clear across the world to San Fransisco.

03:05.178 --> 03:06.853
But that we really gave him the slip

03:06.953 --> 03:09.642
by moving them into a Days
Inn, 10 minutes down the road.

03:10.037 --> 03:11.498
What, are you saying that I'm paranoid?

03:11.618 --> 03:13.536
No. I'm saying is that if it was Massoud,

03:13.656 --> 03:15.101
we'd be cold by now.

03:15.221 --> 03:16.271
6 It's not him.6 Right.

03:16.299 --> 03:18.252
Well either way, that money's
been out there for 6 days.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.747
Somebody's going to start spending

03:19.774 --> 03:21.530
and the second they do
those treasury servers

03:21.558 --> 03:22.683
- go for our neck.
- Stop saying that shit man.

03:22.683 --> 03:23.926
Just stop saying that.

03:23.972 --> 03:26.579
- Ray, you're scaring Spud.
- Yeah, Ray, you're scaring Spud.

03:26.585 --> 03:27.960
Well you should be fucking scared.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.890
As long as that money's
out there we're exposed.

03:30.885 --> 03:31.920
Okay.

03:32.005 --> 03:34.809
- Do you have any suggestions?
- Yeah, we get the motherfucker that did Cheat.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.275
We don't know who killed Cheat.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.544
Fine, fine. We find out
where the cash is flagging.

03:38.620 --> 03:40.508
That gets us the
motherfucker that did Cheat

03:40.536 --> 03:42.182
and we bury him in the goddamn dirt.

03:42.605 --> 03:44.105
Nobody's burying any body.

03:44.554 --> 03:47.325
Not with San Francisco's
finest on our asses, Ray.

03:48.026 --> 03:50.016
We need to be careful, you hear me?

03:51.226 --> 03:52.626
Oh yeah? Now who's scared?

03:52.938 --> 03:55.426
- Do you guys want coffee?
- Yeah, look.

03:55.968 --> 03:57.368
It's very simple, Raymond.

03:57.797 --> 03:59.662
We don't have enough clean cash

03:59.681 --> 04:02.132
to service the contracts
that we have right now.

04:03.653 --> 04:05.053
We need new business.

04:05.420 --> 04:06.663
- Business?
- Yeah.

04:06.935 --> 04:08.802
How can you think of business right now?

04:10.634 --> 04:12.265
You know that if the tables
were turned and it was you,

04:12.293 --> 04:14.113
rotting away in a box 6 feet under

04:14.121 --> 04:17.899
Cheat would rain hellfire down on
this city to find the guy that did it.

04:20.591 --> 04:23.695
If we don't get new business we go under.

04:24.853 --> 04:26.053
And then all of this

04:26.162 --> 04:27.562
is for shit.

04:31.189 --> 04:33.194
Fine. Then let Spud decide.

04:33.904 --> 04:35.538
- What?
- What?

04:35.946 --> 04:37.161
Grow a set, pick a side.

04:37.188 --> 04:38.834
- There are no fucking sides.
- There are sides.

04:38.853 --> 04:40.302
There are precisely 2 sides.

04:40.316 --> 04:42.329
Business as usual or sweet,

04:42.347 --> 04:43.902
retributive justice.

04:43.934 --> 04:45.214
This is ridiculous.

04:45.237 --> 04:47.405
Man my heart's beating so fast right now.

04:48.197 --> 04:49.597
Spud?

04:57.633 --> 05:00.608
I think that we should... we
have to go after the money.

05:04.341 --> 05:05.731
Fine.

05:10.757 --> 05:13.871
I'll get a contract, so
your families don't starve.

05:38.585 --> 05:40.131
Oh. You scared me.

05:40.158 --> 05:41.558
Sorry.

05:43.706 --> 05:46.761
Look, I know that you're going
to take this the wrong way,

05:47.653 --> 05:49.876
but no one would blame you
if you sat this one out.

05:51.877 --> 05:53.413
Well that's very kind of no one.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.007
She's gone, Travis.

05:57.455 --> 05:58.967
Well I'm glad you cleared that up.

05:59.791 --> 06:00.918
Jesus!

06:00.918 --> 06:03.470
You have no idea what a
friend looks like, do you?

06:04.476 --> 06:08.123
You can't burn down the world every
time it deals you a shitty hand.

06:09.376 --> 06:12.399
You're referring to my son's
murder as a  shitty hand?

06:18.786 --> 06:20.372
If you're going to do this

06:20.492 --> 06:22.504
I need you focused.

06:24.077 --> 06:26.208
Do I look unfocused to you?

06:27.137 --> 06:28.710
No.

06:29.271 --> 06:31.838
You look exactly like I
did a couple of years ago.

06:33.824 --> 06:35.204
A guy in Cleveland

06:35.231 --> 06:38.376
was strangling stay-at-home moms
to death while the kids watched.

06:38.496 --> 06:40.463
Three deep before it came to me.

06:41.817 --> 06:43.694
And I caught that son of a bitch.

06:45.562 --> 06:47.679
But while I was soaking up the win...

06:48.160 --> 06:49.792
Two more bodies turned up.

06:51.887 --> 06:53.453
So...

06:53.573 --> 06:56.735
I know what it's like to feel responsible.

06:56.954 --> 06:59.112
To take it personally.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.079
I got the wrong man.

07:04.064 --> 07:06.989
And those women's deaths are on me now.

07:13.106 --> 07:15.712
Don't do this for Sarah.

07:15.832 --> 07:18.971
Because she's just another
mission casualty right?

07:21.173 --> 07:22.373
No.

07:22.493 --> 07:24.013
Because in my experience,

07:24.036 --> 07:26.311
dead people are really
bad at giving forgiveness.

07:53.818 --> 07:55.218
Hi.

07:56.495 --> 07:58.267
Uh, Tom's in the den.

07:58.387 --> 08:00.039
You want to come in?

08:00.039 --> 08:01.639
Great.

08:03.606 --> 08:05.896
Thank you, Shelly.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.541
- Here.
- Thank you.

08:08.661 --> 08:10.959
The Belushi's want us for six

08:10.970 --> 08:13.209
and we still have to stop for the keesh.

08:13.329 --> 08:14.729
So a...

08:14.754 --> 08:17.396
Mm-hmm. OK.

08:22.261 --> 08:23.866
So, what's up?

08:24.591 --> 08:26.893
I might need you to take Evie for a while.

08:27.568 --> 08:30.346
OK. Yeah, sure. No problem.

08:30.366 --> 08:31.766
Do you remember...

08:32.025 --> 08:34.187
You remember my UC? I told you about her.

08:34.409 --> 08:36.062
- Sarah?
- Yeah.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.210
Yeah sure, the $20 sandwich, right?

08:39.309 --> 08:40.710
Yeah.

08:42.429 --> 08:43.933
Yeah.

08:47.461 --> 08:49.062
So there's a problem.

08:51.525 --> 08:53.372
There was a complication.

08:53.989 --> 08:55.757
But you're alright?

08:58.816 --> 09:01.317
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm being ridiculous.

09:03.397 --> 09:05.571
And you have a keesh to get to...

09:07.000 --> 09:08.756
Is she dead?

09:11.287 --> 09:13.945
Yeah. Yeah, we think so.

09:15.861 --> 09:18.740
Well I'm sorry to hear
that. That's terrible.

09:19.529 --> 09:22.113
And they want me to go back undercover.

09:22.233 --> 09:24.175
Try to find out what happened to her.

09:24.423 --> 09:25.960
Ah...

09:27.573 --> 09:30.288
OK, so what a... what'd you tell them?

09:31.957 --> 09:34.244
Nothing. I'm still thinking about it.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.305
You're going to talk to Evie though.

09:36.396 --> 09:37.796
Yeah.

09:38.249 --> 09:40.243
Course, I'm going to talk to her tonight.

09:41.653 --> 09:43.309
Grace.

09:44.736 --> 09:47.701
She's never going to say anything, so I am.

09:48.673 --> 09:51.717
She has loved these
last few months with you.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.748
And all I'm saying...

09:54.261 --> 09:56.390
is, maybe it's someone else's turn.

09:59.043 --> 10:00.869
I'm responsible, Tommy.

10:02.656 --> 10:04.331
Somehow, I doubt that.

10:14.499 --> 10:16.477
Golubovic, Harriet.

10:21.565 --> 10:23.282
Next.

10:24.581 --> 10:26.573
Hamm, Nickolas Barbara.

10:29.519 --> 10:30.919
Next.

10:31.591 --> 10:33.213
Nice cravat, though.

10:49.839 --> 10:51.303
What are you robbing me?

10:51.423 --> 10:54.127
Only of your clutter, dear.

10:54.247 --> 10:56.839
Honestly, I don't know
how you live in this place.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.067
Well, it is certainly getting harder.

10:59.086 --> 11:01.640
And I thought it'd be good for you
to do something nice for others,

11:01.640 --> 11:02.646
once in a while.

11:02.766 --> 11:05.527
- And it's good for the soul.
- Please, just stop it.

11:05.859 --> 11:08.237
- Mother.
- What's the matter?

11:08.751 --> 11:12.272
It's been exciting, having you here...

11:13.050 --> 11:16.800
But I may have to go away
for a while. For work.

11:17.029 --> 11:20.244
And I'm sure Marty can't wait to
have you back all to himself, so...

11:20.253 --> 11:22.919
- Work?
- Yeah, for a while.

11:23.397 --> 11:25.144
What about Evie?

11:25.818 --> 11:28.587
- She's going to stay with Tom.
- No, that's not what I meant.

11:29.044 --> 11:30.781
You made her a promise.

11:31.194 --> 11:33.800
- I'm sorry.
- I don't think you are.

11:34.112 --> 11:37.231
You made her a promise and now
you're breaking that promise.

11:37.469 --> 11:39.047
How can you do that to her?

11:39.047 --> 11:40.847
Do what? I'm not doing anything.

11:40.853 --> 11:42.454
That's ridiculous.

11:43.712 --> 11:46.433
The last time you left
your family for work...

11:46.553 --> 11:48.308
Sam died.

11:49.451 --> 11:51.850
Why would you ever do that to them again?

11:51.970 --> 11:53.870
Are you really that selfish?

11:53.876 --> 11:56.140
- That's enough.
- Are they coercing you?

11:56.448 --> 11:58.272
Threatening you?

11:58.711 --> 12:00.279
Are they making you do this?

12:00.302 --> 12:02.543
You don't understand,
I have a responsibility.

12:02.554 --> 12:03.886
To your daughter.

12:04.111 --> 12:06.067
And what the hell would
you know about that?

12:06.698 --> 12:08.098
Mmm?

12:08.933 --> 12:10.574
Nothing, Grace.

12:12.751 --> 12:14.878
I know nothing about it.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.675
Yes, sir.

12:24.943 --> 12:26.343
Understood.

12:33.305 --> 12:36.103
Hey, I think I found some
workable options for Travis.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.824
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

12:39.140 --> 12:40.592
What are you talking about?

12:40.754 --> 12:42.154
The DoD.

12:42.288 --> 12:45.267
We're talking about the details
of this classified investigation.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.484
That you leaked.

12:46.511 --> 12:49.896
- to an unauthorized contact at the DoD.
- I didn't leak details, I made an inquiry.

12:49.924 --> 12:51.371
Yeah, without my permission!

12:51.491 --> 12:52.921
Without your permission?

12:53.001 --> 12:54.843
So that's what this is about?
You want to measure dicks?

12:54.874 --> 12:57.642
Do you have any idea of
the shit storm you caused?

12:57.742 --> 13:00.880
No, Elliot. I have no fucking
idea of the shit storm I've caused

13:00.894 --> 13:03.212
because you don't tell me a damn thing!

13:03.738 --> 13:08.362
And why the hell does the DoD care
about laundered money in San Fran?

13:08.462 --> 13:10.428
Okay, I am not going to repeat myself.

13:10.455 --> 13:11.653
Alright?

13:12.129 --> 13:13.984
You know what I know.

13:14.921 --> 13:17.661
But now my boss has the
undersecretary on his jock

13:17.662 --> 13:20.552
and I look like the asshole who
can't keep his people in line.

13:20.590 --> 13:23.850
I can't tell you how much I don't
care if you look like an asshole.

13:30.558 --> 13:32.819
This is the last time we
have this conversation.

13:34.506 --> 13:36.006
Is that clear?

13:42.181 --> 13:43.681
Is that clear?

13:44.581 --> 13:46.045
Crystal.

13:47.546 --> 13:49.691
And you can stop looking
for Travis's handler.

13:51.823 --> 13:53.323
You found someone?

13:54.556 --> 13:55.956
Elliot?

13:57.701 --> 13:59.530
I decided to keep it in-house.

14:00.106 --> 14:02.394
Oh no. I'm am not a handler.

14:02.982 --> 14:04.804
Don't worry, I'll be around more.

14:05.231 --> 14:06.631
Oh, to keep an eye on me.

14:07.328 --> 14:09.377
Well maybe if someone had
kept an eye on you in Cleveland

14:09.385 --> 14:11.341
you wouldn't be in this
situation right now.

14:11.397 --> 14:13.709
There'd certainly be a few
less bodies in the ground.

14:34.712 --> 14:35.984
What?

14:37.359 --> 14:38.559
What?

14:38.584 --> 14:40.300
You've been staring at me all night.

14:40.762 --> 14:42.513
Either you're really
afraid of zombies or you're

14:42.547 --> 14:44.814
too chicken to ask me if
I'm having sex with Billy.

14:45.382 --> 14:47.718
No, I what... Wait. Are you?

14:47.748 --> 14:50.352
Oh, yeah. He totally rocks
my world. Want the deets?

14:50.370 --> 14:51.585
Oh, Evie.

14:51.685 --> 14:53.068
Mom.

14:53.306 --> 14:55.410
No. I wasn't...

14:58.098 --> 15:00.090
But I... I did...

15:00.506 --> 15:02.305
I did want to, um...

15:06.478 --> 15:09.664
to tell you how much I've enjoyed
these last few months with you.

15:15.521 --> 15:17.140
Obviously.

15:17.436 --> 15:18.836
I'm delightful.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.030
Kind of.

15:33.173 --> 15:36.165
I swear to God I'd rather just
split for Tijuana at this point.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.520
Next.

15:40.864 --> 15:42.746
Chisari, Julian Bates.

15:54.711 --> 15:56.308
What?

15:56.954 --> 15:58.297
Come take a look.

15:58.306 --> 16:00.181
I'm not getting up.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.770
Assistant U.S. Attorney...

16:04.207 --> 16:05.607
out of San Fran,

16:06.657 --> 16:09.478
taking a run at a counsel
seat, that could be interesting.

16:09.685 --> 16:12.448
OK, I don't know if you missed the
point of the exercise, fucktard,

16:12.473 --> 16:14.633
but I thought we were tracking
the money as a means of

16:14.651 --> 16:16.441
avoiding the need for a lawyer.

16:16.561 --> 16:19.525
He worked a case for the
Treasury in the past year.

16:19.625 --> 16:22.271
- Two cases.
- OK. Let me see that.

16:22.391 --> 16:23.971
Come on. Shift!

16:27.740 --> 16:30.311
Maybe you think we can find someone better.

16:31.285 --> 16:32.685
Huh, fucktard?

16:38.213 --> 16:39.877
Well, at least have a nectarine.

16:39.977 --> 16:42.333
Are you insane? It has twice
the calories of a peach.

16:42.578 --> 16:44.395
That can't possibly be true.

16:44.677 --> 16:46.959
Not everyone has your metabolism.

16:47.059 --> 16:49.087
Evie, honey. You gotta eat something.

16:49.115 --> 16:50.340
I'll grab an espresso on the way out.

16:50.460 --> 16:52.105
Two seconds, I can make you a waffle.

16:52.147 --> 16:53.547
You're being weird.

16:53.869 --> 16:55.269
Just... just wait.

16:55.364 --> 16:56.779
- Fine, give me the nectarine.
- No.

16:56.825 --> 16:58.869
No, I need to talk to you about work.

16:59.761 --> 17:01.901
It's fine. Grandma already did it.

17:04.436 --> 17:05.637
What?

17:05.692 --> 17:08.196
I'm 16. It's not that big of a deal.

17:09.023 --> 17:11.159
Plus, Grandma's here to
buy me beer if I need it.

17:11.857 --> 17:13.391
Joke. It's a joke.

17:14.821 --> 17:16.494
I already talked to your dad

17:16.496 --> 17:19.031
and I think I would feel
better if you stayed with him.

17:19.193 --> 17:20.844
And do you care how I feel?

17:21.746 --> 17:24.955
- Of course I care.
- Mom, I just got used to it here.

17:25.053 --> 17:27.321
My friends are here. My school is here.

17:27.564 --> 17:28.964
Billy's here.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.189
Just another adult to help supervise me.

17:31.209 --> 17:34.299
- That's not funny.
- It'll be fine, Grace.

17:35.068 --> 17:39.074
I think I remember how to appropriately
ruin the fun of a 16-year old girl.

17:39.649 --> 17:41.049
And eat your breakfast.

17:41.615 --> 17:43.171
Real men don't go for that

17:43.190 --> 17:45.046
super skinny look.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.684
Come on.

17:49.804 --> 17:51.147
Ugh! Fine.

17:52.346 --> 17:54.989
I'm going to leave my emergency
number on the refrigerator,

17:55.017 --> 17:57.669
so if there's a problem, then you call...

17:57.688 --> 18:00.021
Then they will text my cover phone.

18:00.039 --> 18:02.609
And it says your data plan's
out of date. Yeah, yeah.

18:02.729 --> 18:04.318
It's not my first rodeo.

18:04.438 --> 18:06.735
Thanks, mom. You're the best.

18:08.873 --> 18:10.831
- I love you.
- I love you too!

18:20.096 --> 18:22.656
OK. I don't think waitress is an option.

18:22.776 --> 18:26.868
What if I was an accountant with
a specialty in money laundering?

18:27.661 --> 18:29.710
- That's it.
- You think?

18:30.112 --> 18:32.664
That's officially the worst
idea you've had all day.

18:33.542 --> 18:36.501
OK. These have to be the most
boring criminals I've ever seen.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.993
Corporate intelligence,
security consulting.

18:39.001 --> 18:40.758
Four bodies in two weeks?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.715
Well, I would start offing bodies too,

18:42.733 --> 18:44.324
if my job was running background checks

18:44.324 --> 18:46.273
on medical equipment supply companies.

18:46.302 --> 18:50.229
Swat Valley. Military
intelligence. Drugs and money.

18:50.349 --> 18:52.903
Tell me one more time,
this is not terrorism.

18:53.647 --> 18:55.136
It's not terrorism.

18:55.236 --> 18:56.718
Would you even know if it was?

18:56.745 --> 18:58.803
We're looking for a money source.

18:58.831 --> 19:01.474
How hard can it be? Pretend
it's your ex-husband.

19:02.464 --> 19:05.389
Jesus Christ! Would you two
just go fuck each other already?

19:08.243 --> 19:10.604
Well you might as well
put our divers on standby

19:10.630 --> 19:13.767
so they can fish my body out of
the bay when Ethan Kelly makes me.

19:14.255 --> 19:16.017
I still think we stick with hooker.

19:18.074 --> 19:21.275
All this guy does is watch and
analyze people for a living.

19:21.295 --> 19:23.013
He's a walking bullshit meter.

19:24.751 --> 19:26.993
They've got a pitch coming up at AFG Labs.

19:27.039 --> 19:28.127
What's that?

19:28.142 --> 19:29.520
Um, a pharmaceutical company.

19:29.542 --> 19:32.481
- Well who runs it?
- President is Jack Merrimer.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.479
VP, Nate Schembre.

19:34.579 --> 19:36.396
Well, maybe we could use them.

19:36.415 --> 19:38.446
Looks like our boys are down a man.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.147
Maybe they could use a new driver.

19:40.267 --> 19:43.074
OK. Kelly ran human intel in
the military for four years,

19:43.086 --> 19:46.413
and he vets people for a living. He's
gonna see through any cover we throw at him.

19:46.954 --> 19:49.742
So maybe we could use
that to our advantage.

20:04.807 --> 20:05.968
- Hi.
- Thank you.

20:06.334 --> 20:07.931
- It's good to see you.
- See you then.

20:10.642 --> 20:12.210
Nate Schembre?

20:12.691 --> 20:14.401
You are Nate Schembre, yeah?

20:15.173 --> 20:17.264
You played for Michigan, tight-end, '05?

20:17.384 --> 20:18.099
Yeah.

20:18.219 --> 20:20.948
- Ethan Kelly man, good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

20:21.184 --> 20:23.496
Didn't you guys go to the
national championship game?

20:23.631 --> 20:25.961
Yeah, we did. We lost.

20:26.655 --> 20:29.152
I'm sorry man, I actually
had money on you guys.

20:29.252 --> 20:30.370
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.489
Sorry about that.

20:31.609 --> 20:33.671
- You play?
- Yeah, Harvard.

20:35.225 --> 20:38.619
Man, I broke so many fingers,
catching hot rods across the middle...

20:38.638 --> 20:41.445
By the end of the season, I
mean my hands were like mitts.

20:42.105 --> 20:44.903
Every time the temperature drops, my
knuckles look like a noodle squirming.

20:44.928 --> 20:48.067
- Cheers!
- Yeah, man. You as well.

20:55.055 --> 20:56.427
So, what about now?

20:57.259 --> 20:58.421
- What's your racket?
- Hey.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.725
Well, I actually run a
private security business.

21:00.845 --> 21:02.976
Excelsior Intelligence.

21:04.021 --> 21:05.290
You?

21:05.525 --> 21:08.039
Pharmaceuticals. AFG Labs.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.362
No shit. I think I have a
meeting with your boss, uh...

21:11.406 --> 21:13.155
What is it? 12:30 on Tuesday.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.002
What?

21:18.697 --> 21:20.189
Nothing, uh...

21:22.954 --> 21:24.416
It's a "fuck off" meeting.

21:24.576 --> 21:25.858
I'm sorry?

21:25.978 --> 21:28.438
Jack's had a standing
1:00 lunch reservation

21:28.457 --> 21:30.387
at Monte Bianco since before I signed up.

21:30.432 --> 21:32.762
Hasn't missed a saltimbocca in a decade.

21:33.504 --> 21:36.983
Well, I guess I'll have to be more
impressive than prosciutto-lined veal.

21:37.103 --> 21:38.609
Yes, you will.

21:38.655 --> 21:41.463
- Jesus!
- Damn. Did I... I'm so...

21:41.508 --> 21:43.713
- I got it all over your shirt. That is...
- No, it's...

21:43.731 --> 21:45.750
You know what, let's just
put this right down here.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.101
It's fine.

21:47.179 --> 21:49.516
- Look-it, that is a disaster.
- Yeah, look at that.

21:49.636 --> 21:51.579
I'll bet they have a spare one in the back.

21:51.588 --> 21:53.408
Why don't I go ask them. You are so cute.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.081
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Yeah.

21:56.173 --> 21:58.351
- You don't go any where.
- Alright, I'll be here.

21:59.978 --> 22:01.853
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

22:01.937 --> 22:03.337
Good night.

22:09.697 --> 22:11.409
Well, you're no hooker.

22:14.226 --> 22:15.552
Johnny Hooker?

22:15.799 --> 22:17.957
Robert Redford? The Sting.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.157
Yeah, I'm more of a Paul Newman type.

22:21.414 --> 22:22.621
Hmm, I bet.

22:22.657 --> 22:24.057
Hold on.

22:24.746 --> 22:26.146
You give me the wallet...

22:27.109 --> 22:28.309
And you leave.

22:28.382 --> 22:29.782
And I don't call the cops.

22:30.874 --> 22:34.238
Now, you're not as much fun as
that goofy red hair makes you look.

22:34.954 --> 22:38.333
And you're not as charming as the pseudo
southern accent makes you sound, honey.

22:38.378 --> 22:40.163
And where does that leave us, Sugar?

22:40.283 --> 22:42.274
Oh, I guess a little tired and irritated.

22:42.677 --> 22:44.645
I'm sorry, that's not my idea of a party.

22:51.349 --> 22:54.175
You sure you know what to do
in this situation, handsome?

23:09.842 --> 23:11.242
How was that?

23:12.933 --> 23:14.333
Unsatisfying.

23:34.629 --> 23:36.213
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.755
I think you dropped that.

23:39.349 --> 23:41.864
- Thanks.
- You got it. Have a good night.

23:48.780 --> 23:51.365
Chisari has a week spot for this site.

23:51.665 --> 23:54.164
I'm telling you. This is our way in.

24:02.044 --> 24:03.567
Did you ever think you were gay?

24:04.906 --> 24:06.306
What?

24:06.351 --> 24:07.751
You know, in high school...

24:08.133 --> 24:10.701
When the girls wouldn't
pay attention to you,

24:10.741 --> 24:12.886
start thinking maybe
it's something different?

24:12.953 --> 24:14.469
No. Never thought that.

24:14.716 --> 24:16.866
Right. Good, good. Me neither.

24:19.994 --> 24:22.052
We got a request from Chisari.

24:26.389 --> 24:28.894
I've been standing outside for 15 minutes.

24:28.937 --> 24:30.997
Find someone who can find my car for me.

24:30.997 --> 24:33.113
I'm sorry, sir. Your
wife redeemed the ticket.

24:33.233 --> 24:34.633
My wife!?

24:34.766 --> 24:36.966
My wife is in Trinidad with my brother!

24:36.975 --> 24:38.466
And the vindictive bitch that she is,

24:38.500 --> 24:41.245
I really doubt she came back
her just to steal my fucking car!

24:41.365 --> 24:42.565
Is there a problem, sir?

24:42.601 --> 24:44.338
Yeah, yeah. There's a problem.

24:44.384 --> 24:46.625
There's a huge car-sized problem.

24:46.745 --> 24:49.445
I run security, so maybe there's
something I can help you with.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.063
Well, you can help me find my car!

24:55.753 --> 24:57.177
Hey Eth, what's up?

24:57.285 --> 25:00.144
Hey you got a second? I need you
to borrow some satellites for me.

25:00.177 --> 25:01.694
Yeah, sure. What you got?

25:01.814 --> 25:04.853
I'm looking for a black '68
Mustang aftermarket GPS rig.

25:04.869 --> 25:07.898
License plate is 3 Juliet Tango.

25:16.661 --> 25:18.061
Nah.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.523
We ain't seen nothing like that here.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.128
Well it was probably a couple of hours ago.

25:23.137 --> 25:24.811
Maybe one of your guys knows something.

25:25.125 --> 25:27.349
It's just me and Smootch
here, grinding it out.

25:27.449 --> 25:28.918
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

25:29.222 --> 25:31.846
- Hey yo, Smootch?
- Yeah, what?

25:32.330 --> 25:34.820
Opie over here is searching for a vehicle.

25:34.940 --> 25:37.002
Of alleged prolonged acquirement.

25:37.102 --> 25:38.669
You know anything about that?

25:39.087 --> 25:41.285
'86 Stang? Black?

25:41.966 --> 25:44.033
- Yeah.
- Tan, leather seats?

25:44.214 --> 25:48.300
Brought in by some Zoë
Saldana-looking thing?

25:48.520 --> 25:50.008
Yeah, that's right.

25:50.706 --> 25:52.365
No, I ain't seen nothing like that.

25:54.657 --> 25:56.156
There it be, Opie.

26:32.003 --> 26:33.467
Where to?

26:33.664 --> 26:36.742
Couple hundred dollars, you tell me
the last cab that came to this address?

26:36.862 --> 26:38.262
And where it was going.

27:04.869 --> 27:07.283
Well look at you, Cracker Jack.

27:07.846 --> 27:09.240
Did you miss me?

27:09.360 --> 27:10.855
Like a UTI.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.497
- How much did you get for it?
- Nothing.

27:14.528 --> 27:17.985
I just like driving them into the
bay and watching them sink, you know?

27:19.829 --> 27:23.980
'68 390 GT Fastback.
I'm guessing about 110.

27:24.100 --> 27:27.099
But Fig and Smootch aren't really
running an auction house, now are they?

27:27.216 --> 27:29.217
So what? 50? Maybe 55?

27:29.226 --> 27:31.202
Please!

27:31.221 --> 27:34.065
A vortech v1 blower and a Paxton hat,

27:34.185 --> 27:36.049
aluminum valve covers and intake,

27:36.154 --> 27:39.719
original AK dash tach, 5
spoke Intra 17 inch wheels?

27:39.758 --> 27:40.958
Damn!

27:41.101 --> 27:43.615
How can you see a classic
like that in pieces?

27:43.954 --> 27:47.317
Yeah, wait til I start rattlin'
off the product codes, precious...

27:47.417 --> 27:50.557
You know McQueen used to drive that car.
You should show a little bit of respect.

27:50.677 --> 27:53.515
Well, let's all observe
a moment of silence then.

28:00.069 --> 28:01.469
Cash or cops?

28:01.706 --> 28:03.404
I already heard that one tonight.

28:05.807 --> 28:09.230
Well, maybe that's a sign that your life
isn't heading in the ideal direction.

28:16.082 --> 28:18.366
Can I have auto theft, please?

28:24.591 --> 28:27.287
No, no. That's OK. It's the wrong number.

28:30.973 --> 28:32.642
Jesus!

28:32.826 --> 28:34.629
Maybe you are driving them into the bay.

28:41.340 --> 28:43.073
- _
- Says here your phone bill's due.

28:43.841 --> 28:45.615
You wanna read my emails too?

28:52.608 --> 28:54.514
The guy deserved it, by the way.

28:55.050 --> 28:57.404
Had his hands all up in
my titties at the club.

28:57.404 --> 28:58.410
Oh yeah?

28:58.429 --> 29:01.456
Oh, I guess it's been a disappointing
night for him all around then, hasn't it.

29:03.477 --> 29:04.877
Thanks.

29:05.194 --> 29:06.615
This has actually been fun.

29:06.735 --> 29:08.289
Here.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.311
Get yourself a maid.

29:26.719 --> 29:27.919
Mom, what's wrong?

29:27.944 --> 29:30.832
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out
which remote is for the audio...

29:30.871 --> 29:33.212
The gray one, the black or the silver?

29:33.231 --> 29:34.895
No. No.

29:35.417 --> 29:38.307
Vivian, this number that you dialed

29:38.427 --> 29:40.292
is for emergencies only.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.930
So am I supposed to just
sit here and read all night?

29:43.450 --> 29:46.161
- Why didn't you ask Evie?
- She's out with Billy.

29:46.979 --> 29:48.954
Wait... Now?

29:48.972 --> 29:50.162
At midnight?

29:50.282 --> 29:51.682
Oh, please.

29:52.043 --> 29:55.375
When you were 16, sometimes
I wouldn't see you for days.

30:11.461 --> 30:12.852
She acts like it's a big deal, you know?

30:12.853 --> 30:14.980
Like life would cease to
exist if she wasn't around.

30:15.654 --> 30:18.078
I mean, yeah. It's been
OK having her here, but...

30:18.681 --> 30:21.248
Go do your thing. Geez, it's not
a crime to have a job, you know?

30:21.368 --> 30:23.794
- Yeah.
- Plus Grandma's here.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.407
Although I think that actually might
of worked against me in this situation.

30:28.843 --> 30:30.078
Huh.

30:30.949 --> 30:32.950
Then a little baby alien
exploded out of her chest

30:32.968 --> 30:35.089
and started feasting on my grandma's face.

30:36.250 --> 30:37.650
Jesus, Billy!

30:38.336 --> 30:40.751
- Sorry, I just...
- God, you're such a lightweight.

30:45.082 --> 30:46.311
Did you know...

30:46.431 --> 30:49.329
My dad was working for
your mom when he died?

30:50.234 --> 30:51.634
What?

30:52.623 --> 30:54.757
He wasn't even supposed
to be working that night.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.589
Um...

30:58.245 --> 31:01.522
- No, I didn't know that.
- And she didn't care, she just...

31:02.353 --> 31:03.908
Used him.

31:07.429 --> 31:08.805
I'm sure that's not true.

31:08.819 --> 31:10.420
'Til he was all used up.

31:12.303 --> 31:13.703
Um.

31:18.102 --> 31:19.803
I'm going to go get us some drinks, OK?

31:19.830 --> 31:21.074
Yeah.

31:26.016 --> 31:27.416
Hold on.

31:28.133 --> 31:29.333
- Hey!
- Hi.

31:29.417 --> 31:31.995
- Can I get a whiskey and a beer, please?
- Sure thing!

31:32.205 --> 31:33.863
Hey.

31:38.298 --> 31:39.698
One for me?

31:40.250 --> 31:42.932
I'm digging that milk chocolate
thing you got going on...

31:44.236 --> 31:45.636
Hey!

31:46.244 --> 31:47.845
Billy!

31:51.793 --> 31:53.193
Stop!

31:53.637 --> 31:55.037
Stop it!

31:58.556 --> 31:59.956
Fuck!

32:01.786 --> 32:03.979
Oh my God, Billy! You OK?

32:26.185 --> 32:27.853
What do you want?

32:30.117 --> 32:31.517
I just want to talk.

32:32.623 --> 32:34.680
I'm billing the Bureau
for the time, so talk.

32:34.730 --> 32:37.504
Can you just put down
the gloves for a second?

32:37.604 --> 32:39.401
OK, Lenny. Alright, peace.

32:39.746 --> 32:41.980
Peace, Lenny. It's all... alright,

32:42.004 --> 32:43.929
- I want peace.
- Fine.

32:44.865 --> 32:46.371
Is that it?

32:46.398 --> 32:48.301
Can I um... Can I come in?

32:53.306 --> 32:54.706
Thanks.

33:01.205 --> 33:02.678
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

33:02.688 --> 33:04.513
That I should have turned
down the promotion in protest?

33:04.544 --> 33:07.034
How about acting like
Cleveland wasn't all my fault?

33:07.069 --> 33:08.734
It was all your fault.

33:10.649 --> 33:14.348
It was your task force Lenny, not
mine, not any one else's. It was yours.

33:14.677 --> 33:17.827
You fucked up and if you have to
stay mad at me forever, then fine.

33:17.842 --> 33:19.794
Tell me you want out and I'll let you out.

33:20.871 --> 33:22.684
- What?
- Out.

33:23.814 --> 33:26.666
If you want out, just say it
and I'll call DC and have them...

33:26.942 --> 33:30.152
Send a replacement. Because I
can't keep  going on like this.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.173
If that's what you want.

33:36.165 --> 33:37.565
It's not what I want.

33:40.615 --> 33:42.396
It's the last thing that I want.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.377
Look, I'm sorry.

33:46.497 --> 33:48.313
I'm sorry that I've been a dick, but...

33:48.316 --> 33:51.499
Don't think that I don't
realize, for one second how...

33:51.759 --> 33:53.637
how lucky I am to have you here.

33:55.290 --> 33:57.820
Alright, and you... you
deserve a second chance.

33:57.849 --> 33:59.238
But right now I am...

33:59.358 --> 34:01.689
I am in way over my head.

34:02.447 --> 34:03.721
And I need you

34:03.748 --> 34:06.190
at 100%, because that's
the only way this works.

34:15.263 --> 34:17.108
Thank you.

34:17.391 --> 34:18.791
For apologizing.

34:19.174 --> 34:20.574
OK, good.

34:25.621 --> 34:27.109
Alright, have a good night.

34:33.228 --> 34:35.264
I just opened a bottle...

35:24.320 --> 35:26.843
Hi, this is Julian Chisari.

35:26.884 --> 35:28.590
I have a reservation for tonight.

35:28.965 --> 35:32.858
Yeah, I was wondering if
I could request room 404.

35:33.792 --> 35:38.248
Yeah, my partner and I
just really love the gray...

35:38.789 --> 35:40.189
wall color.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.852
Really love gray.

35:46.095 --> 35:47.495
Oh, OK. Thank you.

35:49.493 --> 35:51.666
- You put the camera in the shower?
- Yeah.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.279
OK. We're done.

35:58.529 --> 36:00.740
How does it feel to sleep with the boss?

36:01.645 --> 36:03.438
You tell me.

36:04.885 --> 36:06.285
Who was your last?

36:06.678 --> 36:08.285
Boss?

36:08.738 --> 36:10.151
Come on, you know what I mean.

36:12.527 --> 36:14.528
A New York City fireman.

36:15.796 --> 36:17.330
God, really?

36:17.967 --> 36:20.946
Honest to God, a New York City fireman.

36:21.301 --> 36:22.701
Wow.

36:23.215 --> 36:25.089
God, how do I compete with that?

36:25.466 --> 36:27.098
You don't!

36:31.940 --> 36:33.682
How about you?

36:35.429 --> 36:36.829
Me?

36:38.831 --> 36:40.231
What?

36:42.349 --> 36:46.154
You want me to regale you with tales
of my many, many, many conquests?

36:49.653 --> 36:52.201
God, there it is. Right there...

36:52.942 --> 36:56.654
How ridiculous you can be. That's
why I knew I was in trouble.

36:56.704 --> 36:58.104
Come on, you missed me.

37:01.094 --> 37:05.326
Well at least I understand
now why you hired me.

37:05.336 --> 37:07.872
Oh, please. I barely had an orgasm.

37:21.855 --> 37:23.367
Come on.

38:43.868 --> 38:46.009
I wanna see about some more of that.

38:47.119 --> 38:48.606
Storm the castle!

38:49.054 --> 38:50.610
Oh, my God!

38:56.034 --> 38:57.234
Yeah!

38:57.258 --> 38:58.658
My liege!

39:01.888 --> 39:03.288
I'm so, so sorry.

39:03.688 --> 39:05.255
You send that forward.

39:11.488 --> 39:13.421
Oh, yeah. I got that right there.

39:13.541 --> 39:15.413
Look at that guy, look at that guy.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.050
- You're not, you're not...
- Wait a second, wait a second.

39:19.250 --> 39:20.325
Oh, my God.

39:22.303 --> 39:24.423
Oh, come on. When you've been
married as long as I have,

39:24.457 --> 39:26.280
you got to get ideas where you find them.

39:27.505 --> 39:28.903
Ooohhh.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.914
- Is that..
- That's gotta hurt, right there.

39:36.224 --> 39:37.624
How you doing?

39:38.570 --> 39:40.495
Good. I think.

39:42.341 --> 39:43.859
Nice to be back.

39:45.568 --> 39:47.060
Yeah? Any problems?

39:47.068 --> 39:48.468
My mother's insane.

39:48.915 --> 39:51.610
Well, I'll make a note
of that in the case file.

39:53.754 --> 39:55.154
How about you?

39:55.738 --> 39:57.138
You ready?

39:57.504 --> 39:58.683
Yeah.

39:59.177 --> 40:01.002
I briefed the guys at AFG Labs.

40:01.102 --> 40:02.502
They're playing ball.

40:03.663 --> 40:05.063
Good.

40:05.690 --> 40:08.607
So, uh... what's he like up close?

40:09.589 --> 40:10.989
Mmmm.

40:11.914 --> 40:13.482
Typical dreamboat.

40:14.944 --> 40:17.178
Confident. Mysterious.

40:18.101 --> 40:20.193
Knows his 1st gen American muscle.

40:20.313 --> 40:22.244
Is he gonna cause us any problems?

40:23.567 --> 40:25.637
They never do until they do.

40:26.464 --> 40:27.969
Well, we'll be waiting.

40:28.966 --> 40:30.477
Yeah.

40:31.738 --> 40:34.143
Well, I'm going to stay ready just in case.

40:35.579 --> 40:37.582
And if I sleep,

40:37.628 --> 40:39.970
it's gonna be with my safety off tonight.

40:40.678 --> 40:42.078
What does that mean?

40:42.501 --> 40:43.958
Come on, Lenny.

40:46.112 --> 40:48.245
Sarah's disciplinary record.

40:49.885 --> 40:51.787
My shooting reviews.

40:53.029 --> 40:55.525
Those serial murders
you botched in Cleveland?

40:57.626 --> 41:00.138
We were hired because
they had leverage on us.

41:00.531 --> 41:02.125
On all of us.

41:04.495 --> 41:07.902
I'm not going to sit here and
pretend that someone's got my back.

41:09.871 --> 41:13.143
That's how you get two in the skull
and tossed in the back of a trunk.

41:15.915 --> 41:17.596
Keep your head up.

41:43.745 --> 41:45.145
Stop.

41:45.274 --> 41:47.413
Yeah! My liege!

41:50.333 --> 41:52.063
Impressed?

41:52.400 --> 41:55.403
Fortunately, but I don't think
your constituents will be.

41:55.523 --> 41:57.761
You are running for city counsel, right?

41:57.770 --> 41:59.261
Are you two insane?

41:59.381 --> 42:00.781
This is San Fransisco.

42:00.881 --> 42:03.121
I couldn't get elected if I
wasn't fucking male prostitutes.

42:03.129 --> 42:04.943
But what would your
husband think about that?

42:04.989 --> 42:06.944
We have an open marriage, pissfuck.

42:07.511 --> 42:09.936
He was probably sucking
cock in the room next to me.

42:13.593 --> 42:14.993
Holy shit!

42:15.770 --> 42:17.170
Is that all you got?

42:17.930 --> 42:20.883
You're trying to blackmail an
Assistant U.S. Attorney with a sex tape?

42:20.888 --> 42:23.481
Oh, you two shitheads are so fucked.

42:23.729 --> 42:26.161
Whip out that video again and
I'll show you how fucked you are.

42:26.195 --> 42:29.252
Ooh, you hear that Spud?
He wants you to whip it out.

42:32.764 --> 42:35.782
Yeah, you might want to take
a real close look at the date

42:35.791 --> 42:38.233
on this ID card of that
kid you just defiled.

42:39.935 --> 42:43.441
Yeah, we would have gotten a copy of
his driver's license, but... you know.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.770
- He doesn't have one yet.
- Jesus!

42:47.061 --> 42:49.732
He said he was... he said he was 18.

42:50.270 --> 42:53.312
I'm sure that's going to go
over really well with the voters.

42:54.037 --> 42:56.150
OK. Here's what's going to happen now.

42:56.815 --> 43:00.047
We're going to give you the serial
numbers of some marked bills.

43:00.661 --> 43:02.288
Talk to your friends at the Treasury.

43:02.306 --> 43:04.722
Let us know when and where they show up.

43:04.842 --> 43:07.126
- Simple.
- I don't have friends at the Treasury.

43:07.813 --> 43:09.797
I worked a case there six months ago.

43:09.917 --> 43:11.544
Well, that's your problem.

43:12.184 --> 43:13.746
Piss fuck!

43:14.922 --> 43:18.319
There is nothing more frustrating
than forfeiting market position

43:18.339 --> 43:20.928
to leaks of trade practices and designs.

43:21.128 --> 43:22.400
Now,

43:22.721 --> 43:24.961
I know it's getting a little late in
the morning, but if you would direct

43:25.006 --> 43:28.802
-  your attention please to...
- Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Kelly.

43:29.945 --> 43:32.485
Feel free to leave your
literature with my team.

43:33.365 --> 43:37.261
Sir? What if I told you I know a
wonderful Italian restaurant on the 2nd?

43:37.679 --> 43:39.164
It's not even open to the public yet.

43:39.284 --> 43:42.375
They make a saltimbocca
that makes Monte Bianco

43:42.384 --> 43:43.884
look like Hungry Man.

43:44.266 --> 43:46.500
We can continue the conversation
there, what do you say?

43:46.729 --> 43:49.692
My daughter is the head
chef at Monte Bianco.

43:56.351 --> 43:57.970
Almost had it there, Harvard.

44:04.455 --> 44:06.170
It was a good pitch.

44:07.066 --> 44:09.244
Just came in a little
hard on the landing, maybe.

44:09.289 --> 44:10.689
Yeah, thanks.

44:11.509 --> 44:15.178
Jack's a traditionalist. But deep
down, he knows you're not wrong.

44:15.935 --> 44:18.687
- Wrong about what?
- This business is changing.

44:18.955 --> 44:21.422
We've lost ground to Bryant
Moore for 7 straight quarters,

44:21.459 --> 44:23.425
due to people exactly like yourself.

44:24.093 --> 44:27.885
I'm starting to worry that if they get their
happy pill out of pre-clin before we do...

44:27.898 --> 44:31.034
I might have to start taking an
adjunct gig at U.S.F. this fall.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.080
Well,

44:33.403 --> 44:36.453
- let me know if they're hiring.
- Think I can do you one better.

44:37.487 --> 44:39.013
Help me level the playing field.

44:39.829 --> 44:43.419
Get me the bio-informatics
on Bryant Moore's SSRI

44:43.675 --> 44:46.202
and I will get Jack to
reconsider his position.

44:50.734 --> 44:53.290
- How'd AFG go?
- It was good. It was fine.

44:53.390 --> 44:56.717
- I need you to run a background check for me.
- Some more pharma folks?

44:57.029 --> 44:58.429
Nah.

45:12.937 --> 45:14.337
Her.

45:14.457 --> 45:17.711
- Who's she?
- Someone who might come in useful.

45:27.356 --> 45:29.228
Get there. God damn it.

45:32.414 --> 45:34.072
They're up!

45:36.585 --> 45:38.242
How many do they have?

45:39.119 --> 45:40.856
Whoa! I got a match.

45:43.093 --> 45:44.493
I got two matches.

45:45.280 --> 45:46.680
Two already.

45:48.037 --> 45:50.514
Another one, Erica Potter.

45:50.889 --> 45:52.609
Jacqueline Parker.

45:53.914 --> 45:55.314
Sloan Townsend.

45:56.715 --> 45:58.333
Marylin Cobb.

45:58.613 --> 46:02.111
That last one's got warrants outstanding
for Grand Theft Auto in Arizona and

46:02.120 --> 46:03.578
a B and E in South Carolina.

46:03.678 --> 46:05.871
Wow. Your friend is an interesting woman.

46:07.032 --> 46:09.145
Or should I say, women.

46:14.367 --> 46:15.885
That's all 6?

46:16.005 --> 46:17.888
That was painless.

46:18.428 --> 46:20.061
Hey, good work.

46:29.853 --> 46:31.840
- Hold on.
- What?

46:32.075 --> 46:33.457
I got something here.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.109
- What, another match on Cybil?
- What is that, 6?

46:36.126 --> 46:38.534
- No, it's 7.
- This one's different.

46:38.927 --> 46:41.414
Someone tried really hard to hide this one.

46:42.816 --> 46:46.499
I found it sifting through the cache of
the Oakland Police Department backlogs.

46:46.619 --> 46:49.511
Looks like it goes with the
imprint from an old arrest report.

46:49.544 --> 46:51.011
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second.

46:51.946 --> 46:53.094
Is that...

46:53.395 --> 46:54.804
Yeah.

46:56.735 --> 46:58.832
What the hell have you gotten us into?

47:15.164 --> 47:17.204
Hey, do you know who this is?

47:17.853 --> 47:19.480
Jackie Hayes?

47:23.432 --> 47:25.127
Oh, yeah.

47:27.717 --> 47:29.482
Yeah, I know Jackie Hayes.
