<i>[bright folk music]</i>

00:05.373 --> 00:07.508
- "Come meet me,
Arthur Cochran.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.710
I'm single and a doctor"?

00:09.743 --> 00:11.679
I don't think
I've ever said that.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.247
I do drink a lot.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.549
- Stuff I've agreed to
on a bender...dang.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.552
I still have
so much makeup to sell.

00:18.586 --> 00:21.522
- Wow, Arthur,
your head looks so huge.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.225
You're like a giant,
grumpy PEZ dispenser.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.526
I'll see you at Singles Night.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.027
- No, you will not
see me at Singles Night.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.597
And who decided
it was okay to use my photo?

00:29.630 --> 00:32.433
- Sorry!
I needed to entice all ages,

00:32.466 --> 00:34.402
and you're in
a demographic sweet spot.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.937
To the elderly widows,
you're a hot young renegade

00:36.970 --> 00:38.706
who does not have time
for blood thinners,

00:38.739 --> 00:40.108
and to the middle-aged
divorcees,

00:40.141 --> 00:42.009
you're not their husband.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.445
- The elderly widows are the
reason we have Singles Night

00:44.478 --> 00:46.547
at 2:00 in the afternoon.
- My wife just died.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.449
I'm not interested
in dating anyone.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.584
- I'm not a monster.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.953
I just love love
and I'd love to be the reason

00:52.986 --> 00:55.723
a couple falls in love.
It doesn't have to be you.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.892
- Who's the "Second First
Church of the Cumberlands"?

00:58.926 --> 01:00.528
- We are.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.130
- That's a ridiculous name
for a church.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.232
I've been calling it
the First Second

01:04.265 --> 01:06.367
Church of the Cumberlands,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.936
which is also
a ridiculous name for a church.

01:08.969 --> 01:12.373
- Aww, you've been
talking about us.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.108
- Not in the way
you were hoping.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.909
[bell ringing]

01:15.943 --> 01:22.483
<i>* </i>

01:22.516 --> 01:24.285
- We need to talk.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.786
- If this is about
that cinnamon bun I ate,

01:25.819 --> 01:27.087
it's only 'cause
I sneezed on it.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.422
It was basically garbage.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.758
- Girl, don't eat garbage.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.493
Why are you in here
hiding from Dwayne?

01:32.526 --> 01:34.262
- Dwayne's here?
No way.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.096
[chuckles awkwardly, sighs]

01:36.130 --> 01:37.431
It's just so awkward

01:37.465 --> 01:40.067
with Singles Night/afternoon
coming up.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.170
We still haven't spoken
about how he showed up

01:42.203 --> 01:43.804
on my lawn
and asked me out yet.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.439
- It's not surprising.
You still haven't told

01:45.473 --> 01:47.275
the line cook your name
is not Jeanine.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.777
- Oh, please.
Ginny's a difficult name,

01:49.810 --> 01:53.314
and plus, I don't wanna confuse
Athanasios Pappadopolis.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.784
It just sucks.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.520
Dwayne and I used to be so
close, and now it's so awkward.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.121
- I mean, do you want
to go out with him?

02:01.155 --> 02:03.291
- No.
Well, I mean, maybe.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.293
I don't know.
Just not right now.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.627
- Just be honest with him.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.962
- I mean, every time
I look at him, I still see

02:08.996 --> 02:11.665
the enormous third grader who
was my square-dancing partner.

02:11.699 --> 02:14.202
- Whenever I look at him,
I see a paying customer

02:14.235 --> 02:16.337
who's waiting
to give his order.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.806
- On it.
- Thank you.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.809
- Athanasios.
- Jeanine.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.479
- Hey, Dwayne, the usual?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.315
Vegan lumberjack,
tofu over hard?

02:27.348 --> 02:28.882
- Yes indeed.
- Mm-hmm.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.851
- So Ginny--Ginny?

02:32.853 --> 02:35.723
You're probably not going
to Singles Night, huh?

02:35.756 --> 02:38.459
- Actually, I am.
- Oh, well good.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.228
Save me a dance?

02:40.261 --> 02:41.362
- Sure.
- All right.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.563
- I'll put you
on my dance card.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.131
- Okay.
- That's a thing, isn't it?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.066
I mean, I don't know,
I could never afford cotillion.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.901
I just kissed boys behind
the country club dumpster.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.437
[laughs awkwardly]
I'll see you there.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.039
- You know you just
agreed to go out on a date

02:52.072 --> 02:53.374
with him, right?

02:53.407 --> 02:54.675
And admitted you
were fast and poor.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.245
- [whispers] Oh, my God...

02:57.278 --> 03:00.681
<i>choir: * Hallelujah,
Thine the glory *</i>

03:00.714 --> 03:05.353
<i>* Revive us again </i>

03:07.255 --> 03:08.856
- I'll check the wiring,

03:08.889 --> 03:11.692
but most flickering lights
are caused by ghosts.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.727
- [sighs]
Well, I appreciate it.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.665
Just when you think things
can't get more primitive--

03:17.698 --> 03:19.267
[gasps]

03:19.300 --> 03:22.503
- The human larynx
is remarkably vulnerable.

03:22.536 --> 03:26.374
- Easy, old timer.
No one has to get hurt here.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.576
Psych!
[shouts]

03:28.609 --> 03:30.511
- No dice, stumpy.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.845
- [groans]

03:31.879 --> 03:33.347
[bottles jingle]

03:33.381 --> 03:35.416
[groaning]
Only my mama calls me stumpy.

03:35.449 --> 03:38.085
Oh, God,
I fell on my keys, Art.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.186
- [choking] It's all right.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.522
This Hannibal Lecter rip-off

03:41.555 --> 03:43.457
is my father-in-law.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.893
[coughs] The hell are you
doing here, Tinsley?

03:45.926 --> 03:47.261
Besides breaking and entering.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.897
- I saw this at the VA.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.534
My daughter's been dead
a month,

03:53.567 --> 03:56.370
and you're the poster boy
for Singles Night.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.071
- I'm done with
the phase of my life

03:58.105 --> 03:59.773
where I have to explain
myself to you.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.309
We are no longer related.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.143
Now get the hell
off of my boat.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.379
- Actually,
this boat belongs to me,

04:05.413 --> 04:08.148
so how about you
get the hell off my boat?

04:09.517 --> 04:11.385
- Whoever's boat it is...

04:11.419 --> 04:13.253
it's haunted!

04:13.287 --> 04:15.389
- It's my haunted boat.
- I said it's my boat.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.890
- It's my boat!
- Get off my boat.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.091
- Get off my boat.
- It's my boat!

04:20.494 --> 04:23.230
- Jean told me
that you gave her the boat.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.399
- Well, Jean told me
that you were a Baptist,

04:25.433 --> 04:27.468
so it looks like both
of us got some bad intel.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.437
- So what's
your plan here, Tinsley?

04:29.470 --> 04:31.071
- Well,
before there were witnesses,

04:31.104 --> 04:32.606
I was going
to render you unconscious

04:32.640 --> 04:34.342
and then just
drive my boat away.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.143
- Well, raise
a glass to witnesses.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.245
Well, what should we do?

04:38.278 --> 04:41.915
Should we play Monopoly
while you berate me?

04:41.949 --> 04:43.751
Listen to records
while you berate me?

04:43.784 --> 04:46.086
I berate myself, you decide
I'm not doing it right

04:46.119 --> 04:48.155
and then you berate me?

04:48.188 --> 04:51.124
- Whichever you want
to start with, 'cause, uh,

04:51.158 --> 04:53.927
we're gonna play all the hits.
- [sighs]

04:53.961 --> 04:56.163
- Reverend Jax,
why the emergency rehearsal?

04:56.196 --> 04:57.698
- Our sister church
is coming to Singles Night.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.367
I thought we could
knock their socks off

04:59.400 --> 05:01.935
with an impromptu
choir performance.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.337
- Where's Arthur?
- Yeah.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.305
By now I'm guessing
he's at the bottom of the lake.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.675
His father-in-law's
as lethal as I'd be

05:07.708 --> 05:09.610
if I still had my Bowflex.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.212
- Local climate never
did agree with you.

05:12.245 --> 05:15.115
Might be best to leave,
before it turns against you.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.117
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I can wait you out.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.488
I brought my own rations.

05:20.521 --> 05:24.324
Your horned-up church
has been sending me

05:24.358 --> 05:27.561
care packages
ever since Jean died.

05:27.595 --> 05:30.197
The Lord provides.

05:30.230 --> 05:34.735
Apparently dark chocolate,
but nobody's perfect.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.807
- God, I hate the way you chew.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.411
- Hurry up! We'll be late
for Singles Night/afternoon.

05:43.444 --> 05:47.481
Oh. Well, we better get going.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.749
We don't wanna be late
for whatever

05:48.782 --> 05:50.050
the opposite of porn is.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.085
- Okay, listen.
If I gave Dwayne the wrong idea

05:52.119 --> 05:54.321
at the Moonbow,
I need to send a clear signal

05:54.354 --> 05:55.556
that I am not interested

05:55.589 --> 05:57.558
in romantic involvement
whatsoever.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.394
- We need an outfit that
sends the right message.

06:00.428 --> 06:03.731
<i>[upbeat twangy music]</i>

06:03.764 --> 06:07.901
What do we think the message
is we're sending here?

06:07.935 --> 06:11.038
- I wanna be hot, but not
hot to Dwayne, who's a vegan,

06:11.071 --> 06:13.240
so I'm wearing a leather skort

06:13.273 --> 06:15.543
and this shirt
that Wayne bought for me.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.546
- You like if cheese fries
for the table were a person.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.383
You look like...
a half-priced hooker.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.387
- See, right now, it's like,
"Who's that nerd?"

06:27.421 --> 06:30.758
But when I wanna attract a guy,
I take the glasses off...

06:32.125 --> 06:33.461
And boom.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.395
- The "Pretty Woman"
montage is over.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.565
I'm picking your outfit.
- That's a good plan.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.868
- All right,
I hear the bus coming.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.136
Go long, man.
- [groans]

06:45.305 --> 06:47.641
- Oh, nope, false alarm.
It's just a pickup truck.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.243
Come on back.
- Wayne, you're here early!

06:50.277 --> 06:52.412
If everyone has
your open-hearted enthusiasm,

06:52.446 --> 06:54.815
this night is gonna definitely
end in a love connection.

06:54.848 --> 06:58.251
And you brought Cash
to an adults-only event.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.554
- Oh, yeah.
Chicks friggin' salivate

07:00.588 --> 07:02.556
over single dads,
and when they show up,

07:02.590 --> 07:05.325
they're gonna see me mid-throw
in an idyllic Toblerone

07:05.358 --> 07:07.227
of father-son bonding.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.562
- My feet hurt, man.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.230
- Hey, no more false alarms,
I promise.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.466
Oh. All right, no,
I hear it for sure.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.702
Fly pattern--go.
- [groans]

07:16.269 --> 07:18.739
- Man, I'm really sorry,
but I lied.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.073
Come on back.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.975
- Oh! Here they are.
- What?

07:22.009 --> 07:24.945
[groans]
Where did it come from?

07:24.978 --> 07:26.647
Change of plans, man.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.582
I'm just gonna
tussle your hair instead.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.818
- I'm sweaty.
- Oh, God, man--what...

07:30.851 --> 07:33.854
you only ran twice.
What in the world?

07:43.463 --> 07:47.100

zipper placement is crucial.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.436
There's a distinct line
between...

07:49.469 --> 07:52.005
"I'm not wearing anything
under this," and,

07:52.039 --> 07:54.174
"I'm with maintenance."

07:56.143 --> 07:57.978
Mmm--here we go.

Be direct.
He can take it.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.290
He's a grown man.
He's sort of two grown men.

- Nice jumpsuit.
- You're too sweet.

08:12.425 --> 08:15.495

Just like my coffee.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.798

Did you know Hawaii

08:17.831 --> 08:19.833
grows the most coffee
in the United States?

08:19.867 --> 08:20.968
Which is weird,

08:21.001 --> 08:22.636
'cause I always associate it
with pineapples

08:22.670 --> 08:24.672
and overweight guys
playing the ukulele,

08:24.705 --> 08:26.740
but actually that's
stereotyping, just like

08:26.774 --> 08:28.642
thinking how everybody
in Kentucky owns a racehorse

08:28.676 --> 08:30.510
or marries their cousin,
which actually shows

08:30.544 --> 08:31.879
a true lack of understanding
about how expensive

08:31.912 --> 08:33.747
it is to board a horse,
but haters gonna hate.

08:33.781 --> 08:34.882
Would you excuse me?

08:36.449 --> 08:39.252

You know, for all
of Germany's shortcomings,

08:48.361 --> 08:51.164
they really make
a hell of a clock.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.367
[vocalizing]

08:56.704 --> 08:59.372
- All right, that's it.
I'm leaving.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.241
- I really thought
you'd last longer

09:01.274 --> 09:02.910
before waving
your little white flag.

09:02.943 --> 09:06.747

is you gotta let 'em know that
you ain't interested, okay?

Your best bet is to, like,
kiss some other girl

No, I'm Georgia.

You can have it.

you care about Jean.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.246

to make pickles.

18:11.324 --> 18:14.827
chorus: * It's electric,
boogie woogie, woogie *

18:14.861 --> 18:18.331
- * Ooh, it's shakin'

18:18.365 --> 18:21.468
chorus: * It's electric,
boogie woogie, woogie *

18:21.501 --> 18:24.571
* Jiggle-a-mesa-cara
she's a pumpin' like a matic *

18:24.604 --> 18:26.239
* She's movin' like electric

18:26.273 --> 18:27.807
* She sure got the boogie

18:27.840 --> 18:33.413
- * Ola ola eh, ola eh

18:33.446 --> 18:39.352
chorus: * Don dela don deloh!
- * Ola ola eh, ola eh

18:39.386 --> 18:42.422
chorus: * Don dela don deloh!

18:42.455 --> 18:45.525
[cheers and applause]

18:50.129 --> 18:53.032
[insects chirping]

18:56.236 --> 18:59.206
- Are you shopping for a plot?

19:03.543 --> 19:06.479
- I know what you did.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.282
I don't need
or want your sympathies.

19:09.316 --> 19:12.719
- I wasn't doing it for you.
I was doing it for Jean.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.188
She asked me
to look out for you.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.892
- Well, she asked me
not to kill you.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.294
- [snorts]

19:21.328 --> 19:23.996
<i>[gentle music]</i>

19:24.030 --> 19:25.965
<i>* </i>

19:25.998 --> 19:28.535
- You wanna know
the real reason

19:28.568 --> 19:31.003
I haven't been by
since the funeral?

19:33.440 --> 19:36.108
It's just too damn hard.

19:38.678 --> 19:42.415
- I thought I'd feel that way,

19:42.449 --> 19:45.918
but this is...

19:45.952 --> 19:49.322
this is where I feel close
to her.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.324
This and--

19:51.358 --> 19:55.628
and that
and the boat.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.166
As hard as it is
for you to visit

20:00.199 --> 20:03.270
is as hard as it is
for me to leave.

20:08.775 --> 20:13.179
- Keep the boat.
She'd want you to have it.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.583
- Thank you, Tinsley.

20:17.550 --> 20:21.521
Hey, would you mind coming
by later to fix those wires,

20:21.554 --> 20:23.523
'cause I don't know
how to do that.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.359
I know you can hear me!

20:26.393 --> 20:27.694
[gasps] Jesus.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.462
- I was hopeful
that Singles Night

20:29.496 --> 20:31.030
would end in a love connection,

20:31.063 --> 20:33.400
but I'll settle
for a family connection.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.735
- That is not
what happened here.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.137
- I think you
"doth protest too much."

20:38.170 --> 20:40.239
Hamlet said that
in the Shakespeare play,

20:40.273 --> 20:42.875
"Everyone Loses When Your
Mother Marries Your Uncle."

20:42.909 --> 20:45.978
[indistinct chatter]

20:54.754 --> 20:56.155
- What's going on there?

20:56.188 --> 20:58.124
- Oh, just another
fella in our family

20:58.157 --> 20:59.726
hitting the jackpot
with a woman

20:59.759 --> 21:01.594
who's out of his league.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.908
- Well, that was
a fun Singles Night.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.445
- Yeah, but Harper
does have concerns

21:18.478 --> 21:20.012
about Dad as a father figure.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.449
- Hmm.
- Pretty and smart.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.618
You're in a lot
of trouble, son.
