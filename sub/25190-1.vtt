03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Eileen.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Please stop by the church
to see my in a few days.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Please.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.999
Now is the time to surround
yourselves with the

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
love, peace, and strength
that the Lord gives to you.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
So I'll see you
both in a few days?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Take care of your mother Anna.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Excuse me.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
I'm sorry. I recognize you.
Have we ever met?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm his dealer Cecily.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
I sold Nathan many fine
pieces through the gallery.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Hey mom. I'm going to
go wait in the car.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
Magnificient and proud, and now?
Reduced to ashes!

07:05.000 --> 07:07.999
Now Buddy... you know you are
inclined to exaggeration.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.999
Listen darling! If things
continue the way they are

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
we're going to have to call off
the whole fucking sha-bang!

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
I'm on my way.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.999
Cecily, darling look at you in
your cunty little bolero jacket

07:32.000 --> 07:33.999
you look divine!

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Hello Buddy.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Have a seat. You're
cafe' is percolating.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.480
As our your thoughts
on you art show.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
The afflicted drama of it all.
Never ending!

07:57.000 --> 07:59.999
You know how it is Cecily.
Tortured artist loses his muse

08:00.000 --> 08:00.000
and then...

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
So find a new one.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.999
A new one? One doesn't
simply find a muse darling;

08:07.000 --> 08:11.999
A muse presents itself to
the artist and so far?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
No one is knocking on
this old queen's door!

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Oh Buddy.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
The show must go on.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.999
Certainly you have enough
pieces to work into

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
a presentation.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.999
Think of all the times
this has happened before.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.999
And it always worked,
because, well..you

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
made it work. So do that now.
Make it work.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Failure is not an option.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
OK.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Activate "diva mode".

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
So. What about you Cecily?

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
Last time we talked, my child,
you were feeling abit "off".

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Yes. Well...

10:07.000 --> 10:08.280
Is it with piece that moves you?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Yes but it's not
just the artwork.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Art serves as a great
excavator of human emotions.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Raising to the surface
that which either true.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Well... um...

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Well I don't see why not.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yes. Very good then.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
She was my miracle baby. I
thought i couldnt have children.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
I never married but i
dated a man for awhile.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Needless to say... we
weren't very careful.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.999
I thought what was there to protect?
Doctors deemed

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
me infertile.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
Then... by the grace of God...
Gabriella came along.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
She was a fun, beautiful child.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Very unique; like you seem.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
She was placed at the
gifted program at school

15:10.000 --> 15:11.360
she was so far ahead
of her peers.

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
Gabriella was a ballerina.
An artist. My world.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
My heart and soul.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.240
For a more indepth examination.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
I will let Nola know
to get ahold of you...

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
regarding my inquiries.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.999
Nola. I have not seen you some time.
How long

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
have you been working
with Oliver?

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
Yes dear. I do think
we should talk.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
As I feel I have a
buyer for this piece.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
But... somebody who would not
settle on market prices.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Let's step into my office.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Cecily!

21:23.000 --> 21:24.160
May I see you again sometime?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Back for round two?

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Well yea. Drawing and
writing actually.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.999
I have an affinity for creating
martial arts-based comic

26:31.000 --> 26:33.999
characters. Each with
a different skill.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
One is a kata master,
another knows kung fu.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Very creative. I like that.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.440
It's nice to have a
creative outlet.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.480
Yes. Well it's more
than that for me.

26:48.504 --> 26:50.503
It's almost like therapy.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.080
Hmm. I'm not sure I follow.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.999
Well what I mean is; sometimes
my thoughts get the

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
best of me.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Recent events in my life have...

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
made me feel like I'm spinning,
spiraling into a dark place.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
This... lifts me to a place
where I feel alive again.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Like there is some
sort of purpose.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I am involved in the
art world myself.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Really?

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
I am an art director at
Mison' de la Art Galli.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
And I like to make art
myself sometimes.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Looks like we have
stuff in common.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
Yes well. I must excuse myself.
I have to use the restroom.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.999
I aint never done good in
the romance department.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
The ladies... they want to
wrangle with... you know.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I'm surprised to see
so many men here.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.999
Well we men want a happy,
healthy relationship just like

33:27.000 --> 33:28.999
the next female.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
We just have a hard time
expressing needs or

33:34.000 --> 33:35.999
being in touch with our
feelings as do our female

33:36.000 --> 33:42.000
counterparts but both sexes
struggle with that at times.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Everybody's different.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.080
But that's not a bad thing.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
That is very well put.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
I am here for help.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
And I admit this is not the
most natural experience for me.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.999
But i will speak frankly in
hopes that yourself or another

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
group member may have some
insights to share with me.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
I'd rather not reveal to
many details at this point.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.040
I hope to have my audience
"get it" at the opening.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
Hmmm. uh-huh. I see. Well
I'd like to be there.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
So what else is new?

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
As am I.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.080
I find it strange you're
wearing sunglasses indoors.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.200
Could you remove them perhaps?

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
My eyes are sensitive to
the gallery lighting.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Oliver is relentless Cecily.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
He calls late at night drunk,
requiring me to be his

41:33.000 --> 41:35.999
entertainment for the evening.
Then the next day, I'm

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
required to be responsible for
all of his personal needs.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Oliver did this to you?

41:47.000 --> 41:48.160
If only it was that simple...

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
No. I have a husband.
One of which is

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
unemployed. Depends
soley on my income.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
So I confided in him regarding
Oliver's behavior and this...

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
was his response. He finds
me cheap and disgusting.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
And tainted... by
Oliver's hands.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
Whatever fillment they gave
you was only fleeting.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
Now I am here to give you
something eternal and permanent.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
True freedom.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.999
Well..I'm not sure what
exactly you talking about

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
but it sounds wonderful.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
And I hope we can
continue all of this...

48:40.000 --> 48:42.999
So darling, when are your
pieces finally going to be

48:43.000 --> 48:46.999
ready to show? I've already
picked out my ensemble! I hope

48:47.000 --> 48:49.999
it's still in style
for the opening!

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Buddy you know you
can't force great art.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
Besides, my art is a visual
representation of my life's purpose.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.999
And lately I have been
questioning everything!

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Immensely.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.999
Hello. I'm Sarah Ann. I have
a very important message

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
for you today.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
So as you can see, this is a
message that can increase

50:56.000 --> 50:58.320
the meaning of your life... and
your relationship with God.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Excuse me. I was just
baking some cookies.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Would you like some tea?

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
Please.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.999
What of the stories
of Moses and Jobe?

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
Those who recieved direct
guidance from God.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
They were specific cases...
made to serve a purpose.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
How can you compare
yourself to their level?

52:57.000 --> 53:02.000
Come. I have something
to show you.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Can you feel it Sarah Ann?

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
Can you feel the soul
of God in this room?

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
This is where communion
takes place.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
And I must trust the power of
God i feel moving through me.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.160
This is great. I knew it was
a good idea for us to get

57:41.184 --> 57:42.224
to know each other better.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
Yes. Worth the time
and effort it seems.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
So. I'm interested in knowing
more about your art Cecily.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
Well I don't like to speak much
of my creative endeavors...

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I'd rather let my
art speak for me.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
But if you would like
to speak of your work,

58:08.000 --> 58:09.240
I am more than happy to listen.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
In fact, I'm quite intrigued
by what i have heard thus far.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.999
My work is an extension
of what I'm feeling.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
And my soul.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
It's the only way I can
express myself really.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Sometimes i feel so
vunerable Cecily...

58:27.000 --> 58:28.400
This is hard for
me to admit but...

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
I trust you. I don't know why
but for some reason... I do.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.999
I have been through some
very challenging experiences

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
through my upbringing as well
as my romantic relationships.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
Growing up, neither of my
parents were in the picture.

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
The only family i had
was my Grandmother.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
And she could not care for a
young child on a daily basis.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Where's Doctor Wagner?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.999
Can you believe this Cecily?
Just when i thought

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I had someone
reliable in my life.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So you mean to tell me Doctor
Wagner never arrived tonight?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Buddy, It's Cecily.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.999
I came to counseling
before my show tonight and

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
my instructor is absent.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.320
It is very strange of him to
cancel without notification.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Anyway I was hoping we could
talk before my show tonight.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.160
I'm feeling abit anxious about
such a prominent reveal

01:04:57.184 --> 01:04:59.999
and my feelings for Lucas
are part of the issue.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.999
Please call me back so we can
discuss things before I go

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
on tonight.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.080
I hope you will attend the
opening as planned Buddy.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Goodbye.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.999
"Cecily, I've had
an emergency come"

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.240
up with my dear mother. I'll
be with you spirit tonight!

01:05:55.264 --> 01:05:58.264
I hope your show will be wonderful!
See you soon!

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Buddy.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And Doctor Wagner missed a
very important meeting.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.999
Everyone seems to have
vanished on me when I

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
needed them the most.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Everyone except you.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I'm going to get a coffee.
Would you like some?
