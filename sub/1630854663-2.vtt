00:11.920 --> 00:15.720
(solemn music)

00:25.520 --> 00:28.920
(foreboding music playing)

00:38.080 --> 00:40.080
(camera clicks)

00:46.480 --> 00:48.480
(camera clicks repeatedly)

01:10.160 --> 01:13.120
(theme music)

01:30.080 --> 01:32.260
Who else had access
to the time capsule?

01:32.360 --> 01:35.020
Kalana Baker read
out the murder letter,

01:35.120 --> 01:36.780
then Mick asked Lynn Walcott

01:36.880 --> 01:38.580
to put everything back
in the time capsule.

01:38.680 --> 01:39.660
Who's Mick?

01:39.760 --> 01:41.820
Compton.
He's a local elder.

01:41.920 --> 01:42.940
Ah, but he's a lawyer

01:43.040 --> 01:44.460
and he thought the
letter might be important.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.580
So I locked everything back up
in the evidence room.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.740
So you were the only
person alone with it?

01:48.840 --> 01:50.840
Yes, sir.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.440
(elastic band snapping)

02:03.400 --> 02:05.400
Thanks.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.200
I'm sorry you
saw that.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.520
My parents are going to... Ah!

02:22.760 --> 02:24.060
Hazel, I'm going to
have to ask you

02:24.160 --> 02:26.280
not to tell your
parents yet.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.640
The fewer people that know
at this stage the better.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.080
It's my sister's hair.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.300
I believe you.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.300
But we need proof. Everything
has to be forensically tested.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.400
And how long will that take?

02:45.520 --> 02:47.540
Unfortunately probably
a couple of weeks.

02:47.640 --> 02:50.620
Look, I'm not asking
you to lie, okay?

02:50.720 --> 02:54.140
I'm just asking you to wait
before you tell anyone.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.400
That's bullshit.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.820
That's just word play.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.320
Could you lie to your
mother about this?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.600
I don't know.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.520
Now I know in some...

03:18.840 --> 03:20.380
...some cultures,

03:20.480 --> 03:23.160
hair has, um, power.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.760
I was wondering
if cutting Isabel's hair,

03:29.880 --> 03:33.580
could have had specific
cultural meaning maybe?

03:33.680 --> 03:35.220
That's the first place you go?

03:35.320 --> 03:37.980
Black magic killed my sister?

03:38.080 --> 03:41.160
That is not what I'm saying.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.320
You know what?

03:45.080 --> 03:47.080
Keep your tea.

03:50.840 --> 03:54.600
(solemn music)

03:55.600 --> 03:57.600
Ah, fuck!

03:57.920 --> 04:00.440
(insects chirp)

04:01.960 --> 04:05.460
(elastic band snapping)

04:05.560 --> 04:08.120
(crying)

04:11.680 --> 04:15.760
(elastic band
continues snapping)

04:30.560 --> 04:33.400
(footsteps)

04:37.840 --> 04:39.140
Fuck!

04:39.240 --> 04:41.100
I'm sending it off
to forensic in Brisbane,

04:41.200 --> 04:44.180
and I thought you, um, might
want to check it out first.

04:44.280 --> 04:45.940
(Quinn) It's wild.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.740
Hey boss. What do you
reckon it all means?

04:47.840 --> 04:50.280
I reckon you oughta
get me a coffee.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.780
This was not
a crime of opportunity.

04:58.880 --> 05:02.160
I mean how would the stranger
know about the time capsule?

05:02.840 --> 05:04.840
That's personal.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.340
I mean there's
no sexual assault.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.460
The body was moved and then
dumped outside the cemetery

05:11.560 --> 05:13.260
and the hair
was cut post-mortem.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.820
And why put it in here to be
discovered 25 years later?

05:16.920 --> 05:18.920
Come on.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.500
You want me to
take a squiz at the video?

05:21.600 --> 05:23.100
I probably know
everyone in it.

05:23.200 --> 05:28.060
Um, actually I'm sending it
to Brisbane to get digitised.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.860
It'll be back next week.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.260
You can check it out then,
hey?

05:32.360 --> 05:34.020
This is all pointing to
Isabel Baker

05:34.120 --> 05:36.600
being murdered
by somebody she knew.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.500
There's never been any
evidence to support that theory.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.600
There is now.

05:44.560 --> 05:47.880
(solemn music)

05:48.840 --> 05:50.840
What time are you
leaving tomorrow?

05:51.480 --> 05:53.420
I'm going to stay
a little longer.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.100
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.680
Just until we sort out what's
going on with Aunty Izzy's case.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.160
Right.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.440
What's the new
detective like?

06:05.640 --> 06:08.040
Not local,
so that's a good start.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.400
Can I put a Black Lives Matter
slogan on the mural?

06:16.800 --> 06:19.760
I don't think Nan would
be too happy changing it.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.860
But Aunty Izzy
was an activist.

06:22.960 --> 06:26.740
She was a teenager.
You've got time.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.240
Growing up here with kin,
it's a gift.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.800
She never would have wanted to
cast a shadow over you.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.420
Sarge, I put those songs
on a playlist on your phone,

06:43.520 --> 06:45.900
like you asked.

06:46.000 --> 06:46.900
Thank you.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.160
It's under
'Time Capsule Mixtape'.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.460
(soft music plays from phone)

06:53.560 --> 06:55.560
Good work.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.240
(music playing)

07:01.680 --> 07:05.160
(loud music playing)

07:19.360 --> 07:22.480
(music continues)

07:24.760 --> 07:25.940
She's such a slut.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.060
Just ignore them.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.320
Hector! Stop filming.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.460
Oi, fuck off Tampon.

07:33.560 --> 07:36.300
Got your favourite,
Yum Yum tart.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.860
Aunty Rosa, thank you.

07:38.960 --> 07:39.820
Who's this?

07:39.920 --> 07:42.500
Ah, Hector Ford.
Pleased to meet you.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.460
Hector's filming our documentary
for the time capsule project.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.060
Hope you're including
our community.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.500
(Hector) Definitely.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.940
Could I come and interview you?

07:50.040 --> 07:51.820
I got time now. Hop in.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.660
We'll show you
the real Ashford.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.700
Let's show him the
workers' camp at the mill.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.800
Have fun.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.760
Hey.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.640
(background chatter)

08:18.800 --> 08:21.180
Hey, Dad.
I picked up the mail.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.740
Ta, love.
Tell Mum I might be late.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.840
Yep.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.260
(couple talking indistinctly)

08:31.360 --> 08:33.360
Hector!

08:34.960 --> 08:37.220
-Hey Steve.
-Izzy.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.320
What are you doing?

08:40.440 --> 08:41.540
Who is that?

08:41.640 --> 08:43.260
Chloe's Dad.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.300
He was coming on
to that girl.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.100
I'm serious, I saw the girl...

08:46.200 --> 08:48.280
Hector! We're not
a tourist attraction.

08:55.640 --> 08:59.840
(solemn music)
(cane rustling)

09:09.800 --> 09:12.680
(car tires on dirt road)

09:25.840 --> 09:27.840
(car doors slamming)

09:32.320 --> 09:34.060
It is totally gothic out here.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.580
What does that mean?

09:35.680 --> 09:36.340
Poor.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.440
No, atmospheric.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.020
You know what this means,
Butch?

09:44.120 --> 09:46.320
You've gotta take it
easy for a few weeks.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.220
-Can't.
-Why?

09:48.320 --> 09:49.700
I need the harvest.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.580
I gotta work.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.980
Butch, you've gotta to
listen to your body.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.420
You've gotta
get off the farm.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.980
You're not a young
fella anymore.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.940
Sis, it's all I know
how to do.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.700
That's what I've been
telling Izzy.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.460
You need to get
that education.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.500
Make something
of your life.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.740
Take them chances
that we didn't get.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.620
You got big
responsibilities.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.720
Yes, Aunty.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.140
Our great great grandfather,

10:14.240 --> 10:17.300
he was a chief,
a leader of his people,

10:17.400 --> 10:20.260
and then one morning
he went down to the beach,

10:20.360 --> 10:22.360
and never came back.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.340
He was taken.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.740
All our strong young men
from Vanuatu... taken.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.820
All their blood,
their strength.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.940
Gone from us
into this dirt.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.220
What do you mean
"taken"?

10:34.320 --> 10:38.060
Kidnapped. Brought over here
to slave in these fields,

10:38.160 --> 10:39.900
just so your great great
grandparents

10:40.000 --> 10:41.780
can have sugar in their tea.
-Yeah.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.880
All this...

10:44.280 --> 10:46.880
This is built on the backs
of our people.

10:52.480 --> 10:56.480
(Indigenous music playing)

11:40.640 --> 11:42.640
You don't have to
make me coffees.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.080
I just wanted a sticky beak.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.300
Time capsule inventory.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.180
It's written the morning
before Isabel was killed.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.260
You notice anything?

11:53.360 --> 11:55.380
No.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.480
The purple glitter pen.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.060
It's the same as in
the one with her letter.

12:03.160 --> 12:07.780
Well done. And at the start
of the letter she's -

12:07.880 --> 12:09.980
in love with Ashford,
but by the end

12:10.080 --> 12:13.120
it's full of "predators
disguised as friends".

12:13.640 --> 12:15.640
And The Ankou.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.800
Reaper of souls.
I looked it up.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.200
Get a grip, Constable.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.520
As hot and bothered as a
virgin on his wedding night.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.640
Why don't you carry
a firearm?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.620
Tends to make
people anxious.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.020
Why Cold Case? Homicide
too stressful for you?

12:38.120 --> 12:41.120
I guess I enjoy cleaning
up after people.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.440
Smug bastard!

13:04.560 --> 13:07.560
(whistling)

13:08.680 --> 13:10.900
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Detective.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.540
-Lynn Walcott.
-James.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.500
Walcott, huh?

13:15.600 --> 13:17.740
Any relation to the mill?

13:17.840 --> 13:20.600
-We own it.
-Wow!

13:21.040 --> 13:22.620
You're wondering why
I'm not lying on a beach

13:22.720 --> 13:23.980
drinking mint juleps?

13:24.080 --> 13:25.220
Yes, I am actually.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.140
(laughs)

13:26.240 --> 13:27.460
Would you like to
come through?

13:27.560 --> 13:30.200
Ah, no, I won't take up
too much of your time.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.520
What do you remember about
Isabel Baker?

13:36.360 --> 13:40.940
She was lovely,
kind, thoughtful.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.700
A little bit of
a drama queen?

13:42.800 --> 13:44.260
No.
(laughs)

13:44.360 --> 13:45.700
No, not at all,
the opposite.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.580
What do you think she was
trying to say in her letter?

13:47.680 --> 13:49.020
It was pretty extreme.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.280
Honestly, I have no idea.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.480
It didn't sound like her.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.020
You're taking it
seriously though?

13:59.120 --> 14:01.120
Well, she was murdered.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.880
(sound of water bubbling)

14:06.960 --> 14:09.240
Tell me about
the time capsule.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.380
It was a project for
the detention kids.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.860
Creative punishment,
it was... meant to be fun.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.540
And when was it locked?

14:18.640 --> 14:20.660
On the morning of the formal,

14:20.760 --> 14:24.280
we all got together to do an
inventory of the contents.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.520
It wasn't actually
locked though.

14:31.240 --> 14:34.380
Well, how long was it
unlocked before it was interred?

14:34.480 --> 14:36.480
Oh, about a week.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.940
Okay.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.740
I'm glad that you're...
looking into this.

14:41.840 --> 14:48.120
But I did want to say
- Troy Turner did his job.

14:48.560 --> 14:54.140
Well, me being here is not a
reflection of his investigation.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.780
No, you're here because
Mick Compton made a fuss.

14:57.880 --> 15:01.120
He thinks more would have been
done if Izzy was white.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.460
He might be right.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.100
No, he's wrong.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.260
Every soul in Ashford wanted
that monster caught.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.880
Except for
whoever killed her.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.760
(shells rustle in the wind)

15:17.600 --> 15:20.420
Hey, we've got a visitor.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.420
This is the new fella,
Detective Cormack.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.580
-Hey.
-Hi. James.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.200
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.160
Yeah, we've met.

15:31.080 --> 15:34.820
I, um - I wanted
to introduce myself.

15:34.920 --> 15:38.640
I will be conducting
interviews over the next while.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.620
Now, I appreciate that it
may be difficult for you guys.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.660
We're a strong family.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.760
And God protects us.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.680
You're a believer?

15:50.800 --> 15:52.800
I have my beliefs.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.080
-Please.
-Thank you.

16:01.720 --> 16:02.860
Okay.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.500
In Isabel's letter,
she talks about The Ankou.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.460
That letter's bad business.

16:07.560 --> 16:11.480
The truth is Jesus' way,
not the dark way.

16:14.800 --> 16:19.040
Did Isabel have any interest
in that dark way?

16:20.800 --> 16:22.980
I'm just trying to understand
the language that she used.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.660
You don't think
we are too?

16:24.760 --> 16:25.820
Kids go
through phases.

16:25.920 --> 16:26.980
Not our Isabel.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.080
She sounded
so scared, Joe.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.300
When was our
girl ever scared?

16:33.400 --> 16:34.940
God has a plan.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.080
Sometimes it's not enough.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.560
Sometimes it's no comfort.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.560
Can I talk to you
for a second?

16:52.600 --> 16:54.300
Yeah, you need to
slow down.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.400
That was way
too much today.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.160
No one is going to talk to you
unless they trust you.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.840
They'll trust me...

17:05.440 --> 17:07.440
...if you trust me.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.900
Yeah well, I've
known you for five minutes.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.400
You've already got me lying
to my whole family.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.320
Thank you for not telling
them about the hair.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.200
Very nice to meet you.

17:26.120 --> 17:27.500
What was that all about?

17:27.600 --> 17:29.380
What do you mean?

17:29.480 --> 17:31.620
Secrets.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.240
You got too many, girl.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.320
(phone rings)

17:44.360 --> 17:46.360
Come on!

17:46.880 --> 17:48.340
(woman on phone)
Mick Compton's office.

17:48.440 --> 17:51.340
Hi. It's Detective
James Cormack.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.300
I was wondering if I
could speak to Mick, please.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.560
(woman on phone) He's at a
meeting, can I take a message?

17:56.760 --> 18:01.540
Um... did my number come up
on your caller ID?

18:01.640 --> 18:02.500
(woman on phone) Yep.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.340
Okay, great.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.460
Have him call me on that,
please, when he's free.

18:05.560 --> 18:08.000
It's regarding the
Isabel Baker murder.

18:12.120 --> 18:16.900
Ho, ho ho. Yes.

18:17.000 --> 18:17.900
(video recording playing)

18:18.000 --> 18:19.420
(Isabel on video) ...and the
primary industry is sugar.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.700
(laughing)

18:20.800 --> 18:23.220
(Hector on video) Tash just did
like the maddest kick flip,

18:23.320 --> 18:24.860
you should get
that on film, Tampon.

18:24.960 --> 18:25.820
Go on,
do another one.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.420
(Tash on video) No, I don't
perform on command.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.700
(Chloe voiceover) Dear 2019.
My name is Chloe Walcott,

18:31.800 --> 18:36.020
and in 1994 my life is
pretty sweet.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.420
I just bought my first car

18:38.520 --> 18:41.480
and in a few weeks I'll
be road tripping my head off.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.700
(loud machinery noises)

18:46.800 --> 18:48.380
This is
one big set-up.

18:48.480 --> 18:49.740
Well the mill operates
around the clock

18:49.840 --> 18:51.420
in crushing season.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.860
We process 1.4 million
tonnes of cane

18:54.960 --> 18:57.080
from farms across
the entire valley.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
It's a lot of sugar.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.200
The local dentist must be rich.

19:13.160 --> 19:17.580
I know, um, you and Isabel
were best friends, so...

19:17.680 --> 19:19.880
I'm sorry.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.640
She's been dead
longer than she was alive.

19:32.640 --> 19:36.440
This, is Millie.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.020
We were going to drive
her to Sydney,

19:41.120 --> 19:46.120
party for the summer and
then come back and, start uni.

19:47.760 --> 19:51.240
I'm guessing Isabel never told
her parents about your plan.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.920
She was terrified
of Pastor Joe.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.340
He was very strict.

20:00.440 --> 20:05.780
Really? You never witnessed
any abuse from Joe, did you?

20:05.880 --> 20:11.340
No. God, no.
Joe loved Isabel.

20:11.440 --> 20:14.180
He was just a
protective father.

20:14.280 --> 20:17.160
What about her mood
the weeks leading up to it?

20:18.880 --> 20:21.440
Is this really
because of the letter?

20:22.160 --> 20:25.620
I don't believe she wrote it.
It's probably Hector's idea.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.300
Was he really into the occult?

20:28.400 --> 20:30.460
Wouldn't surprise me.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.080
I'm not saying
that he was...

20:33.720 --> 20:35.780
It's just he enjoyed
provoking people.

20:35.880 --> 20:37.880
(bell rings)

20:40.840 --> 20:43.180
You know it's not
just about the letter.

20:43.280 --> 20:45.420
We've got some
new evidence now.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.520
Are you sure you didn't notice
any mood changes?

20:49.560 --> 20:51.560
No.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.120
What about the
night she died?

20:58.360 --> 21:02.740
Well, she finally dumped Anton.

21:02.840 --> 21:03.860
Do you know why?

21:03.960 --> 21:05.180
(laughs)

21:05.280 --> 21:07.280
Because he's a prick.

21:08.440 --> 21:11.200
He was screwing Tasha
behind Izzy's back.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.240
What do you remember
about the blue car?

21:20.000 --> 21:24.420
I - I only saw it
for a moment.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.800
I didn't see the driver.

21:28.840 --> 21:32.260
I'm sorry. I wish I'd
paid more attention.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.360
Yeah.

21:35.280 --> 21:38.000
The last time you saw her,
what time was that?

21:39.120 --> 21:41.520
I walked her
to the intersection.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.440
Ah it was -
it was around 12.30.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.320
First day of the
rest of our lives.

21:53.480 --> 21:57.760
She turned and blew me a kiss.

22:03.680 --> 22:06.240
(loud machinery sounds)

22:11.760 --> 22:13.760
(phone ringing)

22:14.400 --> 22:16.740
(Turner on phone) Hey Chloe,
how's things?

22:16.840 --> 22:17.980
What new evidence, Troy?

22:18.080 --> 22:20.880
What the fuck is going on?

22:26.960 --> 22:28.960
(man sighing)

22:33.440 --> 22:35.720
Hm-Mmm.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.880
Sneaking out?
You getting us coffees?

22:49.600 --> 22:51.680
So what was last night then?

22:55.360 --> 22:57.360
I don't know.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.320
Relapse.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.480
You prick.

23:07.080 --> 23:11.040
We were drunk.
It shouldn't have happened.

23:13.160 --> 23:17.840
Why not? You're not
married anymore...

23:19.040 --> 23:20.380
It could be fun.

23:20.480 --> 23:26.460
Tash, I'm just not - um...

23:26.560 --> 23:28.560
It's a bad time.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.160
Because of that letter?

23:33.400 --> 23:36.640
You're not still pining
after Isabel, are you?

23:37.760 --> 23:39.760
I've got work.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.720
You fucking are.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.740
She's been dead
25 years, you loser.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.840
What's wrong
with you?

23:59.240 --> 24:00.300
(video recording on TV)

24:00.400 --> 24:03.020
This is my family's
mill, the heart of Ashford.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.100
We drive the economy
of this great region.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.500
The mill has given countless
jobs to people far and wide,

24:08.600 --> 24:11.420
and our sugar is
exported all over the world.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.140
Basically we put
Ashford on the map,

24:13.240 --> 24:15.380
which is why it should really
be called "Walcottsville".

24:15.480 --> 24:16.900
"Walcottsville"?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.260
None of you would be
here if it wasn't for the mill.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.660
Hector, you can
edit this out, right?

24:20.760 --> 24:22.980
(Hector) Yeah I can,
but it's pretty funny.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.780
"It's Wallcottsville".

24:24.880 --> 24:27.280
(solemn music)

24:32.680 --> 24:36.660
(Hector voiceover) Hello class
of 1994. This is Hector Ford.

24:36.760 --> 24:40.680
This is what life was like
back in the '90s in Ashford.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.240
Quit it.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.740
Seriously, quit it.

24:47.840 --> 24:48.980
(Hector) I can see up your nose.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.500
Turn it off.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.540
Hector Ford is a stalker.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.640
(Hector) Whahh!

24:55.040 --> 24:56.180
Do you
think in the future

24:56.280 --> 24:58.580
they'll still
be using brooms?

24:58.680 --> 25:01.040
(Hector) No. Robots for sure.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.840
I can't wait
for that day.

25:04.360 --> 25:07.000
(suspenseful music)

25:29.520 --> 25:32.280
(keys jangling)

25:41.520 --> 25:44.920
(suspenseful music)

25:56.040 --> 25:58.280
(car engine starts)

26:19.440 --> 26:22.600
(car driving then stopping)

26:29.560 --> 26:32.620
God understands
our suffering.

26:32.720 --> 26:38.080
The white bird on the water,
turned into a blackbird.

26:39.480 --> 26:43.820
God has seen, and He has said,

26:43.920 --> 26:47.340
"I carried you on eagle's wings
and brought you to myself".

26:47.440 --> 26:49.180
(congregation shouting)
Hallelujah!

26:49.280 --> 26:51.780
Joseph was sold as a
slave by his brothers,

26:51.880 --> 26:53.740
sold into Egypt.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.380
But God was with him.

26:55.480 --> 27:00.300
And though men meant it for
evil, God meant it for good.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.100
(congregation) Praise Jesus.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.820
We are blessed to welcome
our new friends

27:04.920 --> 27:06.920
to our congregation today.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.340
(clapping)

27:09.440 --> 27:10.900
Thank you Pastor Joe,

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
for welcoming us and helping us
find our feet here in Ashford.

27:22.440 --> 27:26.560
(singing a traditional
Tanna Island hymn)

27:50.720 --> 27:53.020
(indistinct chattering)

27:53.120 --> 27:55.380
Hector, what are you doing here?

27:55.480 --> 27:57.660
I wanted to see you,

27:57.760 --> 27:59.580
and I thought I could
film the church

27:59.680 --> 28:00.980
for the time capsule video,

28:01.080 --> 28:02.620
because your Aunty said we
should include your community.

28:02.720 --> 28:03.420
(laughs)

28:03.520 --> 28:04.640
You're going to have to ask
Dad for permission

28:04.720 --> 28:06.020
for any of that.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.120
Oh, okay.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.180
Is Hector your
new boyfriend?

28:12.280 --> 28:14.880
No. He's just as
annoying as you are.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.880
(indistinct chattering)

28:22.440 --> 28:24.440
Why's Chloe here?

28:28.680 --> 28:29.780
What are you doing?

28:29.880 --> 28:31.220
Millie's fixed.
Come on.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.620
I can't.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.740
Oh, my God,
Hector's stalking you.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.700
Come on. No one's gonna know
that you're even gone.

28:37.800 --> 28:38.900
Okay.

28:39.000 --> 28:39.860
No one's gonna
know it's your car,

28:39.960 --> 28:42.060
and I'm going to
distract Hazel. Let's go.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.160
Okay.

28:44.760 --> 28:47.320
(van starting
and driving off)

28:50.800 --> 28:53.740
So, jack and tire
is underneath.

28:53.840 --> 28:54.580
Yeah.

28:54.680 --> 28:55.820
Do you know
how to change it?

28:55.920 --> 28:58.260
Yeah. Yep.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.620
Yeah. Righto.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.160
When are you telling your Dad
you're going to Sydney anyway?

29:03.880 --> 29:05.880
When I get my exam results,
if they're good enough.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.860
It's for your valuables.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.460
Don't leave anything
in the glove box.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.720
It will get ripped
off, okay?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.820
Do you think Dad'll
ever forgive me?

29:18.920 --> 29:21.240
-Probably not.
-So I shouldn't go?

29:21.840 --> 29:24.400
Nuh, gammin, gammin.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.180
But Pastor Joe
is a proud man.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.440
You're his pride,
so just don't disrespect him.

29:39.840 --> 29:41.140
Hey.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.780
Anton said he wants
to meet you later.

29:42.880 --> 29:43.780
What should I tell him?

29:43.880 --> 29:45.940
Tell him to piss off.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.260
Tell him I'll be
where we arranged.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.140
Okay.
See ya, Tampon.

29:49.240 --> 29:50.300
(giggling)

29:50.400 --> 29:51.900
You should start soon.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.940
Izz, Izz, I need to show
you that video of Chloe's Dad.

29:55.040 --> 29:55.960
You will believe me
when you see it.

29:56.040 --> 29:58.300
Not now. I don't have long till
Mum and Dad get home.

29:58.400 --> 29:59.700
I need to meet Anton.

29:59.800 --> 30:00.940
I could come with you.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.040
I'll see you
at school tomorrow.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.240
Anton?

31:03.360 --> 31:07.480
(suspenseful music)

31:25.920 --> 31:27.960
(heavy breathing)

31:30.080 --> 31:32.100
Jisas plis helpem mi!

31:32.200 --> 31:34.320
(loud motorbike sounds)

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
(motorbike roars)

31:44.920 --> 31:47.320
(loud crashing noise)

32:01.800 --> 32:05.200
(suspenseful music)

32:11.240 --> 32:14.000
(foreboding music)

32:27.000 --> 32:30.040
(intense music)

32:54.600 --> 32:58.680
(dreamlike music)

33:18.800 --> 33:21.720
They found something
else in the time capsule.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.720
It was wrapped in an
Ashford high T-shirt.

33:28.160 --> 33:30.400
It was Izzy's hair.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.080
But...

33:49.160 --> 33:51.200
...it was also plaited.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.840
He plaited it?

34:02.520 --> 34:04.880
I'm sorry.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.980
I don't understand.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.080
I do.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.640
It's someone from here.

34:12.280 --> 34:17.320
It's someone we trust,
took her from us.

34:30.440 --> 34:32.460
Dad can't carry
this alone.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.560
You have to step up.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.000
I know, but how?

34:38.520 --> 34:40.780
Am I supposed to help this
white bully man now?

34:40.880 --> 34:43.980
Yes. If that's
what it takes.

34:44.080 --> 34:46.600
Izzy's speaking to us
from beyond.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.960
Hazel, you've got to let
her back in.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.160
(cane cutter)

35:01.160 --> 35:04.160
(birds chirping)

35:07.840 --> 35:11.860
(Anton voiceover) Dear 2019.
My name is Anton Bianci.

35:11.960 --> 35:14.940
In 2019, I predict I'll be

35:15.040 --> 35:17.020
hopefully running
the Mars colony,

35:17.120 --> 35:19.460
but probably just
running the farm.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.220
Either way
I expect Izzy and I

35:21.320 --> 35:23.380
will have about
three kids by then.

35:23.480 --> 35:26.040
-Coffee, Kath?
-Yes, thanks love.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.560
Okay.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.540
What was your relationship
like with Isabel?

35:41.640 --> 35:46.000
You've read the file.
She was my first love.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.980
Most people get to
remember that fondly.

35:50.080 --> 35:54.340
Yeah. In your statement you said
you were with Natasha Hopkins

35:54.440 --> 35:56.440
on the night of the murder.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.440
Had you been seeing
her for long?

36:00.120 --> 36:02.320
No, Tash was just sex.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.420
What would you say the
difference between sex,

36:07.520 --> 36:09.780
and say an affair is?

36:09.880 --> 36:12.940
Well, if it's serious,
you know, you cook, you eat...

36:13.040 --> 36:15.040
Before you fuck 'em.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.600
(Kath laughs)

36:19.080 --> 36:20.860
Tasha didn't mean anything?

36:20.960 --> 36:22.860
Is that how Isabel felt?

36:22.960 --> 36:25.460
She was pretty angry
the night of the formal.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.900
Hormones.
They were teenagers.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.740
Hormones make teenagers crazy.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.660
I'm not proud about what
happened with Tasha,

36:31.760 --> 36:33.620
but it didn't
mean anything.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.740
It wasn't real.

36:35.840 --> 36:38.220
I loved Izzy,
and she knew that.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.380
Hector just - got her wound
up that night, that's all.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.740
Yeah, in what way?

36:41.840 --> 36:43.920
I don't know,
you're the Detective.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.000
Maybe he wasn't a
pillow biter back then.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.320
So Isabel wasn't
angry with you?

36:58.000 --> 37:00.500
We argued about
a road trip.

37:00.600 --> 37:01.780
That's in my statement.

37:01.880 --> 37:06.060
So she broke up with you so
she could go on a road trip?

37:06.160 --> 37:08.100
No, no, no,
we had our own plans.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.260
Okay.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.340
And she changed her mind?

37:10.440 --> 37:11.780
No, she didn't
change her - look,

37:11.880 --> 37:14.280
she was never going away
on that trip with Chloe.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.680
Her Dad would
have stopped her.

37:17.840 --> 37:20.840
I'm not the one who
fucked up our future.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.160
The man who killed her did.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.700
Police should have found
that blue car.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.060
Exactly.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.580
And what sort of crazy person
takes the hair off a dead girl?

37:33.680 --> 37:36.040
A crazy man, that's who.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.800
What do you make of her letter?

37:42.440 --> 37:43.900
It's bullshit, it's not her.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.260
And The Ankou?
What is that?

37:46.360 --> 37:49.200
Just some
Islander mumbo jumbo.

37:50.280 --> 37:53.840
Actually it's Celtic.
It means Death's Shepherd.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.920
All right, guys, I'm
sorry for interrupting.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.840
Maybe we should do
this another day.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.380
We own the
farm supply store in town.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.480
I'll be doing the
books there later tonight.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.760
Perfect.

38:19.480 --> 38:22.120
(waves rippling)

38:28.520 --> 38:34.320
It's beautiful.
Calming.

38:35.560 --> 38:37.560
Usually.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.400
I told my parents
about Izzy's hair.

38:47.480 --> 38:48.300
It's okay.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.540
They won't saying anything,

38:50.640 --> 38:52.640
but they gotta know it was
someone from here.

39:02.920 --> 39:07.880
Do you ever think it could
have been someone local?

39:09.600 --> 39:11.760
No, we had no reason to.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.440
Hear any gossip at the time?

39:17.200 --> 39:18.820
A bikie enforcer.

39:18.920 --> 39:20.580
Because there was a bunch of
bikies that rode through town

39:20.680 --> 39:22.340
the day of her funeral.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.740
And satanic ritual
gone wrong.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.160
And that last one
really hurt Dad.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.580
Are you a believer?

39:30.680 --> 39:32.380
I have my moments.

39:32.480 --> 39:35.280
But life's pretty
confusing either way.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.920
You know, I always envied
people who had faith.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.260
It felt like they were plugged
into this big battery,

39:43.360 --> 39:46.740
just never run out of energy.

39:46.840 --> 39:49.080
So where do you get
your energy from?

39:52.360 --> 39:54.500
Anger.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.340
You?

39:56.440 --> 39:58.440
Guilt.

39:58.760 --> 40:01.720
Maybe knowing what
happened will help.

40:03.040 --> 40:06.780
They say that darkness
gives birth to monsters.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.980
Turn on the light,
they're gone.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.380
Are they though?

40:11.480 --> 40:14.720
I hope so. Otherwise my job's
pretty fucking pointless.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
You know your tattoo...

40:23.880 --> 40:25.960
...it's the same day
Izzy died.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.360
What's the go with that?

40:33.280 --> 40:36.800
It's also the day my brother
Ritchie went missing.

40:41.080 --> 40:43.080
It's a long story.

40:43.640 --> 40:45.640
Maybe one day I'll...

40:46.400 --> 40:48.560
...I'll be
able to tell it.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.080
Just a coincidence.

40:58.560 --> 41:02.100
I'm Kalana Baker, niece
of Isabel Baker,

41:02.200 --> 41:05.140
who was murdered here in Ashford
by someone she knew.

41:05.240 --> 41:09.340
Like her, I'm a proud
Australian South Sea Islander.

41:09.440 --> 41:13.900
I love my country. But every day
I have to walk past this.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.180
The founder of my home town.
A brave pioneer.

41:18.280 --> 41:20.780
And the man who kidnapped and
enslaved my ancestors

41:20.880 --> 41:22.880
to work in
his cane fields.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.880
Australia needs to admit its
built on black bodies.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.920
Come on, arrest me.

41:35.480 --> 41:37.740
(brushing sounds)

41:37.840 --> 41:39.820
Aunty Izzy would never
have apologised.

41:39.920 --> 41:40.940
She never would have
done any of this.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.660
She was too busy chasing boys.

41:42.760 --> 41:43.820
Now, scrub it properly.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.220
You heard the rumour?

41:45.320 --> 41:46.060
What rumour?

41:46.160 --> 41:49.920
About Izzy's hair.
Is it true?

41:52.280 --> 41:54.840
Keeping secrets for the
bully man now?

41:57.840 --> 42:00.360
I don't have to
explain myself to you, Mick.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.720
You're not the
only one who lost her.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.540
Why didn't you tell me?

42:08.640 --> 42:11.380
Because the new fella asked me
not to for the investigation.

42:11.480 --> 42:12.820
So he matters more than me?

42:12.920 --> 42:14.980
Hey, you show some
respect to your mother.

42:15.080 --> 42:16.380
And what's this
on your Insta?

42:16.480 --> 42:18.100
Vandalising a
public statue?

42:18.200 --> 42:19.540
I was correcting
a public lie.

42:19.640 --> 42:22.380
Is Kalana Baker so weak,
that when trouble comes,

42:22.480 --> 42:24.140
you're going to give in
to your bad angel.

42:24.240 --> 42:25.580
That statue's
the bad angel.

42:25.680 --> 42:26.620
You need to stay out of trouble

42:26.720 --> 42:28.060
and stop throwing
away your opportunities

42:28.160 --> 42:29.300
before you've even earnt them.

42:29.400 --> 42:30.860
Oh, my God, listen to yourself.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.900
You sound like a white
social worker.

42:33.000 --> 42:33.880
Aunty Izzy would be
ashamed of you.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.960
(slapping sound)

42:44.640 --> 42:46.640
I've gotta
go lay down.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.880
(car driving,
then stopping)

43:00.200 --> 43:02.840
(solemn music)

43:17.040 --> 43:19.120
Hello.

43:24.720 --> 43:26.540
Anton?

43:26.640 --> 43:28.800
(bumping sound)

43:34.880 --> 43:36.880
Ah, Jesus.

43:38.960 --> 43:40.860
Are you all right?

43:40.960 --> 43:42.620
Yeah.

43:42.720 --> 43:44.380
What happened mate?

43:44.480 --> 43:46.480
Don't know.

43:47.840 --> 43:50.960
Come on. I'll help you up.

43:53.960 --> 43:56.200
(Anton groans)

43:58.480 --> 44:00.480
Oooh!

44:01.240 --> 44:03.220
That's a nasty one.

44:03.320 --> 44:05.320
Yeah.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.620
Maybe we should
get you to a doctor.

44:08.720 --> 44:12.040
Nuh, nuh, nuh, I'm fine.

44:13.480 --> 44:15.480
Fair enough.

44:20.120 --> 44:21.140
Come on.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.240
Who did it?

44:23.840 --> 44:25.840
I don't know,
he came from behind.

44:27.800 --> 44:30.200
-He just came from behind?
-Yep.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.660
What about when you
were on the ground, hey,

44:33.760 --> 44:35.060
and he's kicking ya?

44:35.160 --> 44:36.900
Maybe you recognised
his shoes.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.980
Nuh, cause I had
my eyes closed.

44:39.080 --> 44:41.060
Must be a concussion
then, huh?

44:41.160 --> 44:42.420
Messing with your memory.

44:42.520 --> 44:43.780
Yeah, must be.

44:43.880 --> 44:45.220
Well, you can't drive home.

44:45.320 --> 44:46.860
What, why not?

44:46.960 --> 44:48.960
Concussion.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.920
You got someone to call?

44:55.520 --> 44:57.520
Okay.

44:57.880 --> 45:00.440
I'll get you a towel.
We'll get you cleaned up.

45:08.520 --> 45:11.400
(phone chiming)

45:18.840 --> 45:20.840
Hello.

45:22.040 --> 45:24.160
No, you can't
say anything.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.960
I'm not going back yet.
I'm staying in Ashford.

45:30.080 --> 45:33.600
I can meet you wherever
you want. Please.

45:38.640 --> 45:42.000
(Car driving
and then stopping)

45:57.280 --> 45:59.060
A bit melodramatic,
isn't it, mate?

45:59.160 --> 46:01.160
You seriously
can't drive?

46:01.840 --> 46:03.700
I'm fine.

46:03.800 --> 46:05.800
It's his idea.

46:06.360 --> 46:08.520
Big hero from Brisbane?

46:09.640 --> 46:12.040
I got it from here,
mate, thanks.

46:13.520 --> 46:15.820
Maybe you shouldn't
be driving either.

46:15.920 --> 46:17.920
Mate, I'm fine,
I've only had one.

46:18.520 --> 46:21.100
I'll blow in a breathalyser
for you if you want.

46:21.200 --> 46:23.360
(sighs)

46:25.280 --> 46:26.740
Just take it easy.

46:26.840 --> 46:28.700
Let's get you home, boy.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.440
We're not done talking
about who did this to you.

46:36.160 --> 46:40.680
What about you? Do you know
who might have done it?

46:43.640 --> 46:48.040
Someone's boyfriend?
Someone's husband?

46:51.600 --> 46:53.680
He loves it.

46:58.960 --> 47:02.920
(car starting and taking off)

47:07.920 --> 47:09.920
(laughing on video recording)

47:33.880 --> 47:36.880
(suspenseful music)

48:00.360 --> 48:03.160
(phone rings)

48:09.680 --> 48:12.100
Hey boss.
You're up late.

48:12.200 --> 48:14.540
The world doesn't stop just
'cause you're not here, James.

48:14.640 --> 48:16.700
So we tracked down
the rego on that car.

48:16.800 --> 48:18.460
It hadn't been
renewed since 94.

48:18.560 --> 48:21.100
Your victim's from
Vanuatu, is that right?

48:21.200 --> 48:22.460
Mm-hm.

48:22.560 --> 48:24.100
Well so is
the car's owner.

48:24.200 --> 48:27.120
He's a Pastor of a church
in regional NSW.

48:32.960 --> 48:36.380
Two Pastors from
Vanuatu walked into a bar.

48:36.480 --> 48:37.860
Have you heard this one?

48:37.960 --> 48:38.820
Are you having
a stroke?

48:38.920 --> 48:41.600
The victim's father was
also a Pastor.

48:43.480 --> 48:46.300
Maybe there's some
kind of connection there.

48:46.400 --> 48:49.480
How about I interview the
car owner in person then?

48:53.000 --> 48:55.760
Yeah. Yeah, please,
that'd be great.

48:56.320 --> 48:59.740
I'll send you some details
that I need from the interview.

48:59.840 --> 49:02.360
-Great.
-Okay, thanks boss.

49:03.600 --> 49:06.720
(suspenseful music)

49:22.840 --> 49:26.120
(Isabel voiceover) In 2019, I
predict that Ashford will be...

49:27.800 --> 49:31.120
...still full of predators
disguised as friends.

49:38.080 --> 49:41.700
I've seen The Ankou here,
sharpening its scythe,

49:41.800 --> 49:43.800
waiting to
reap our souls.

49:55.400 --> 49:57.500
There are people here
I trusted.

49:57.600 --> 50:00.120
But now I know they
feed on suffering.

50:04.760 --> 50:08.280
(suspenseful music)

50:09.360 --> 50:12.620
One day, when I'm
safe from their clutches,

50:12.720 --> 50:15.560
I'll expose them,
and their cruelty.

50:22.280 --> 50:24.420
You promised.

50:24.520 --> 50:26.560
We agreed we'd take it
