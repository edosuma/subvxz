WEBVTT

00:11.667 --> 00:14.041
Now if school policy
allowed me to do so

00:14.125 --> 00:15.583
I would tell you
how these methods

00:15.667 --> 00:18.750
of birth control can be used,
and what they do.

00:18.834 --> 00:22.417
'But I cannot.
I will be fired, so..'

00:22.500 --> 00:24.333
Oh, ain't no
thing,
Ms. Danbury.

00:24.417 --> 00:26.500
Carrie Swett
can tell us.

00:26.583 --> 00:27.750
Ha.

00:27.834 --> 00:30.333
But can't you teach us
about abstinence?

00:30.417 --> 00:31.834
That's legal, right?

00:31.917 --> 00:33.542
Oh, what do you need
to know about it, Quinn?

00:33.625 --> 00:35.250
You live it.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.250
(Danbury)
'If you refrain from
sexual intercourse'

00:37.333 --> 00:39.208
a practice known
as abstinence

00:39.291 --> 00:40.625
you will not
get pregnant.

00:40.709 --> 00:42.625
And if you feel
you can't
abstain

00:42.709 --> 00:44.375
well, let me
give you a hint.

00:44.458 --> 00:46.291
These items on this
sheet here might help.

00:47.333 --> 00:49.125
Yeah, Ms. Danbury.

00:49.208 --> 00:52.500
Is it true that oral
copulation isn't sex?

00:52.583 --> 00:54.208
not

00:54.291 --> 00:57.458
And President Clinton
is a liar.

00:57.542 --> 00:59.542
It's not technically.

00:59.625 --> 01:01.458
Yes, I'd like to hear
from an expert.

01:01.542 --> 01:03.500
- Shut up!
- 'Jerry!'

01:03.583 --> 01:06.834
Okay, well, it's a form
of sexual activity yes.

01:06.917 --> 01:09.083
Whether or not
you consider it as..

01:09.166 --> 01:11.125
You know what?
I can't talk to you about
this.

01:11.208 --> 01:13.333
But it's current
events!
Come on.

01:13.417 --> 01:15.458
You can't get
pregnant from oral
sex

01:15.542 --> 01:19.375
but you can get STD's,
so please be careful. Please.

01:19.458 --> 01:21.166
Or you'll end up
like Carrie
Swett.

01:21.250 --> 01:22.792
Jerry Wood, out!

01:22.875 --> 01:24.125
'Now!'

01:25.875 --> 01:26.917
Saved!

01:31.750 --> 01:33.709
Kidding, Swett.

02:11.125 --> 02:16.000
I did not have sexual
relations
with that woman

02:16.083 --> 02:17.709
'Ms. Lewinsky.'

02:17.792 --> 02:19.917
'I never told anybody to lie.'

02:20.000 --> 02:22.625
'Not a single time, never.'

02:22.709 --> 02:25.125
'These allegations are false'

02:25.208 --> 02:28.500
'and I need to go back to work
for the American people.'

02:28.583 --> 02:29.542
'Thank you.'

02:34.667 --> 02:36.959
- You got here fast.
- You, too.

02:37.041 --> 02:38.875
We've been up all night.
What's your excuse?

02:38.959 --> 02:41.166
Uh, late night
with friends.

02:43.834 --> 02:46.458
- You?
- What?

02:46.542 --> 02:48.709
- I got a life.
- Yeah, right.

02:48.792 --> 02:50.792
You see Gordon at
the office this
morning?

02:50.875 --> 02:52.750
IAD guy?
Thought he was done.

02:52.834 --> 02:55.291
Wants Scotty for round two.

02:55.375 --> 02:56.917
What's the deal
with the van?

02:57.000 --> 02:57.917
Abandoned.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.917
Junkies been using it.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Southeast does
a search for narcotics

03:02.083 --> 03:04.250
this turns up in
the wheel well.

03:04.333 --> 03:05.917
Belonged to Carrie Swett.

03:07.542 --> 03:10.458
15-year-old girl assaulted
and left for dead

03:10.542 --> 03:12.917
in Fairmount Park
back in '98.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.417
Found partially nude.
Blunt force trauma to the
head.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.083
That area,
kids get busy there.

03:18.166 --> 03:20.125
Not that I remember.

03:20.208 --> 03:21.125
That was a theory.

03:21.208 --> 03:22.875
Lovers Lane turned ugly.

03:22.959 --> 03:25.291
Oh, Carrie had
herself
some boyfriends.

03:25.375 --> 03:26.542
Oh, that kind of 15.

03:26.625 --> 03:29.417
Hmm.
So, who owns the van?

03:29.500 --> 03:32.875
Last and only registered
owner
is a Walter Peranski.

03:32.959 --> 03:35.417
Custodian at
Carrie's high school.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.125
Wow. So, Carrie was pretty
much open for business.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.625
Job gives this
guy opportunity.

03:40.709 --> 03:43.500
Maybe her reputation
gives motive.

03:43.583 --> 03:46.291
Think a janitor would know
how to clean up after
himself.

04:23.208 --> 04:24.375
Carrie Swett, 15

04:24.458 --> 04:26.500
beat to death
in Fairmount Park.

04:26.583 --> 04:29.542
Only child. Dad's in Ohio,
out of the picture.

04:29.625 --> 04:32.709
Mother, Sheila, tends bar
at a dive in Kensington.

04:32.792 --> 04:36.333
Says Carrie went out
for a soda, 7:00 P.M. May 17.

04:36.417 --> 04:37.333
Didn't come back.

04:37.417 --> 04:38.834
No murder weapon
at the site.

04:38.917 --> 04:41.667
ME says skull fractures
are irregular

04:41.750 --> 04:43.333
caused by a heavy rock.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.417
Carrie's shirt's off

04:45.500 --> 04:47.333
but no signs
of a sex
crime.

04:47.417 --> 04:51.166
Doer couldn't close the deal,
gets embarrassed, lashes out?

04:51.250 --> 04:53.250
Could be Carrie
rebuffed him.

04:53.333 --> 04:55.375
Well, CSU flagged
her footprints.

04:58.542 --> 05:01.375
Oh, she fought, tried to run.

05:01.458 --> 05:03.166
Yeah, looks like it.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.667
Carrie's wearing a ring
on her wedding finger.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.875
Engraved with the name
Timothy and a heart.

05:09.959 --> 05:12.375
- Who's Timothy?
- Never found him.

05:12.458 --> 05:13.750
Guys they interviewed in '98

05:13.834 --> 05:16.166
laughed at the idea
of buying her a ring.

05:16.250 --> 05:19.208
They said, "It didn't take a
dime to get her ready to go."

05:19.291 --> 05:20.166
Nice.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.709
Someone did care
about Carrie

05:21.792 --> 05:24.000
enough to buy her this ring.

05:24.083 --> 05:27.458
Maybe. But then, where's
he been all these years?

05:32.959 --> 05:36.583
Boss?
You got a sec?

05:38.000 --> 05:41.083
I made an appointment
with the Shrink.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.542
- Good.
- Yeah.

05:42.625 --> 05:46.917
Know you weren't happy
me not keepin' it
together.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.625
Well, it's required.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.166
You're mad I went
in the room with him.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.667
Ed.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.291
I shouldn't
have
let it happen.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.083
But you were shot.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.417
There's nothing
you could have done.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.875
It was my
house,
my guys.

06:01.959 --> 06:03.667
It wasn't your fault.

06:05.667 --> 06:09.000
It shouldn't
have
been you, Lil.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.667
Let me know when you're
done your counseling.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.166
I swear to God,
this is a mistake.

06:22.250 --> 06:24.625
Sit down, Wally.

06:24.709 --> 06:26.458
I've never done
anything illegal.

06:26.542 --> 06:27.959
What about
ditchin' your van?

06:28.041 --> 06:30.625
It-it broke down.
I didn't wanna pay for a tow.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.291
Listen, what happened to
that girl is a terrible
thing

06:35.375 --> 06:36.625
but it wasn't me!

06:36.709 --> 06:39.792
What do you know about
Carrie Swett's reputation?

06:39.875 --> 06:42.250
Girl like that
puts
it on the glass.

06:42.333 --> 06:43.417
She's asking for it.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.792
She had very low
self-respect, I thought.

06:45.875 --> 06:49.458
Yeah. She gave it out
to everybody, huh?

06:49.542 --> 06:51.375
Why not you,
right, Wally?

06:51.458 --> 06:53.000
She was a kid.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.792
Don't be perverted.

06:54.875 --> 06:59.583
How'd Carrie Swett's shirt
wind
up hidden in your van, huh?

06:59.667 --> 07:01.250
Somebody put it in there.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.542
We look like idiots to you?

07:03.625 --> 07:04.750
No.

07:05.583 --> 07:07.917
- Maybe..
- Maybe?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.333
The baseball team,
the captain.

07:09.417 --> 07:11.375
I used to let him go in
there with girls, you know.

07:11.458 --> 07:12.917
Frisky business
during the lunch hour.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.250
- Slow down.
- And this one time--

07:14.333 --> 07:15.667
Take a breath.

07:15.750 --> 07:18.417
I saw him
with Carrie
Swett.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.375
One time, I saw him go
into my van with her!

07:20.458 --> 07:21.667
Who was this guy?

07:21.750 --> 07:23.959
He was captain of the
baseball team back in '98.

07:24.041 --> 07:27.375
Uh...uh, Jerry Wood.
Jerry Wood.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.625
And you let him use
your
van for getting busy?

07:29.709 --> 07:32.000
I didn't think he
was killin'
anybody!

07:32.083 --> 07:33.750
Look, you gotta believe me.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.500
No. I-I thought
it was heavy
petting.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.208
That's what I thought.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.667
We'll look into
the guy, Wally.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.917
Just don't go thinking
your ass is in the clear.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.083
I won't.

07:51.041 --> 07:52.375
You used to get busy
with Carrie Swett

07:52.458 --> 07:54.125
back in high school?

07:54.208 --> 07:55.834
Yeah, why?

07:55.917 --> 07:57.542
We're looking
into a theory.

07:57.625 --> 07:58.875
Been talking
to some guys.

07:58.959 --> 08:00.709
And there were
a lot of guys.

08:00.792 --> 08:04.000
[laughs]
Yeah. True.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.875
We heard
she liked it
rough.

08:05.959 --> 08:07.542
'You know, maybe one of
these guys is trying'

08:07.625 --> 08:10.834
to give Carrie what she
wants,
accidentally goes too far.

08:10.917 --> 08:11.875
Could happen.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.125
So, how was she

08:13.208 --> 08:15.083
when you two were
hitting it, kinky?

08:15.166 --> 08:17.500
She was pretty
boring,
actually.

08:17.583 --> 08:19.000
Lots of
kissy-kissy,
blah, blah.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.667
I tried to mix it up once.

08:22.750 --> 08:24.667
Yeah?
How did that
go?

08:24.750 --> 08:26.917
About the fourth
time
we had done it

08:27.000 --> 08:29.083
brought her to this
van
in the parking lot.

08:30.208 --> 08:32.250
We found her shirt
in that van.

08:32.333 --> 08:36.083
And when Carrie's dead body
was found, no shirt.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.458
You get how
that's adding up?

08:37.542 --> 08:39.709
Whoa.
I didn't kill her.

08:39.792 --> 08:41.083
What happened in the van?

08:41.166 --> 08:42.625
It was just a prank.

08:48.792 --> 08:51.583
I shouldn't even be here after
what you said in health class.

08:51.667 --> 08:52.875
I'm sorry.
Don't be mad.

08:56.333 --> 08:59.250
If you like me, why
can't
you be nice to me?

08:59.333 --> 09:03.417
- Because I'm complicated.
- Me, too.

09:04.709 --> 09:07.792
So, why isn't your
shirt off, pretty girl?

09:13.375 --> 09:15.083
Do you care
about me at
all?

09:15.166 --> 09:16.333
I do.

09:16.417 --> 09:18.750
I think you're really
different from other girls.

09:18.834 --> 09:21.583
- In a good way?
- In a beautiful way.

09:36.917 --> 09:38.917
- 'In a good way?'
- 'In a beautiful way.'

09:39.000 --> 09:40.375
What was that?

09:44.291 --> 09:46.709
- Is that a leopard print
bra?
- Oh.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.667
We were just kidding!
Wait!

10:01.375 --> 10:04.000
She runs away like
a freakin' track
star

10:04.083 --> 10:05.709
so I ditched the shirt.

10:05.792 --> 10:08.417
Romantic guy like you,
you ever call the girl again

10:08.500 --> 10:09.834
take her into the woods?

10:09.917 --> 10:12.166
The night she died,
I had an away game.

10:13.250 --> 10:16.041
You're a Grade D
slice of jackass, Jer.

10:16.125 --> 10:17.792
Better hope your
alibi holds up.

10:24.417 --> 10:27.208
The shirt we found
had Carrie's name in
it.

10:27.291 --> 10:30.458
She used to do that, so I
wouldn't borrow her clothes.

10:30.542 --> 10:31.917
It didn't stop me.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.083
You see this picture?

10:38.125 --> 10:40.166
- Hmm.
- Pretty girl.

10:40.250 --> 10:43.166
- Real open-hearted.
- Yeah.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.959
Sheila, you know if Carrie
was hanging out

10:46.041 --> 10:47.709
with anybody from
the baseball team?

10:49.458 --> 10:53.125
Here we go.
Carrie and the boys...again.

10:53.208 --> 10:54.542
She was a pretty girl.

10:54.625 --> 10:56.000
People paid attention.

10:56.083 --> 10:57.542
But if you're implying
that what happened to her

10:57.625 --> 10:58.875
in those woods
was her fault.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.375
That's not
what we're
saying.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.709
We just wanna know who
she was spending time with.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.917
Like I told you guys all
along,
she was a teenager.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.291
She didn't exactly share
the details with her ma.

11:10.709 --> 11:13.291
But I knew something was up.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.625
Meaning what?

11:15.709 --> 11:21.208
Someone, something
was making her change.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.250
I need new clothes.

11:26.333 --> 11:28.375
I'm sick of people
looking at me all the
time.

11:28.458 --> 11:30.208
They look 'cause
you're adorable.

11:30.291 --> 11:32.083
Not adorable.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.834
Sexy.

11:33.917 --> 11:35.834
I'm not the kind
of girl you marry.

11:35.917 --> 11:37.375
First off, you're way
too young for
marriage--

11:37.458 --> 11:39.709
That's not what
I'm saying.

11:39.792 --> 11:41.959
Mom, don't you get sick
of guys whistling at you

11:42.041 --> 11:43.333
and looking at your chest?

11:43.417 --> 11:45.917
- You got a woman's body.
- I don't want it.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.208
Look, just ignore the boys.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.250
And don't let anyone treat
you how you don't like.

11:51.333 --> 11:52.917
There's Tina.
I gotta go.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.542
Uh, just exactly what are you
guys doing here on a Saturday?

11:55.625 --> 11:56.625
Mom, it's nothing.

11:56.709 --> 11:57.917
We just wanna hang out.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.500
And I don't have to
tell you everything!

11:59.583 --> 12:02.583
Sheesh, I didn't know
it was an FBI secret.

12:04.709 --> 12:05.792
I love you, Care-bear!

12:18.458 --> 12:21.792
It kills me that she didn't
know how special she was.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.291
- Hmm.
- So..

12:23.375 --> 12:26.166
...Carrie was going to
school on a Saturday.

12:28.375 --> 12:31.000
Who was this Tina?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.542
Never brought her around.

12:33.625 --> 12:35.583
I don't know.

12:35.667 --> 12:39.000
Girls were never
very nice to Carrie.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.417
Yeah.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.458
'Thanks, Sheila.'

12:46.041 --> 12:48.041
(Sheila)
'Every year on her birthday'

12:48.125 --> 12:51.500
I light candles
and make a wish.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.959
Maybe this year, you guys
will find who did it

12:56.041 --> 12:58.709
and my wish will
come true.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.125
I found her.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.208
Friend Carrie's
mom described.

13:17.458 --> 13:18.667
Tina Quinn.

13:20.291 --> 13:21.834
Oh, there's your Timothy.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.417
The guy from Carrie's ring?

13:23.500 --> 13:24.959
He's in the picture?

13:25.041 --> 13:26.417
Book from the Bible.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.834
Timothy.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.125
"Flee also youthful lusts

13:29.208 --> 13:30.458
"but follow righteousness

13:30.542 --> 13:31.917
"faith, charity, peace

13:32.000 --> 13:36.542
with them that call on the
Lord
out of a pure heart."

13:36.625 --> 13:38.291
Hearts Wait Club.

13:38.375 --> 13:39.875
Tina's the president.

13:39.959 --> 13:41.542
What's that about?

13:41.625 --> 13:44.166
Playing youthful lusts,
apparently.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.667
It's a purity ring.
Carrie's ring.

13:46.750 --> 13:47.875
Purity, like..

13:47.959 --> 13:49.917
Like, till I'm married

13:50.000 --> 13:53.083
this finger belongs to God,
and so does my virginity.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.542
Veronica's babysitter has one.

13:55.625 --> 13:58.583
Doesn't stop her from getting
busy on my couch, though.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.291
So, Carrie Swett was meeting
this Tina on Saturdays

14:01.375 --> 14:03.667
to go to the Chastity Club.

14:03.750 --> 14:06.917
School prude's trying
to reform the tramp.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.792
Guess there was a guy
in Carrie's life after
all.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.000
The big guy.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.959
I've been
talking
to everyone.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.542
Piecing together
a complete
picture

14:21.625 --> 14:24.667
of the hostage
situation on May
12th.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.625
Right.

14:26.709 --> 14:28.458
Which is what
we did last time.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.959
So, you fired
your weapon,
uh..

14:34.041 --> 14:35.500
...let's see.

14:35.583 --> 14:39.458
Two times intending
to take out Ed
Morrison.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.208
Oh, I did take him out.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.291
When you fired
your weapon

14:43.375 --> 14:45.458
what was your
line of sight?

14:45.542 --> 14:46.709
I already told you.

14:49.375 --> 14:54.125
[clearing throat]
I was on the blind side
of a two-way mirror.

14:54.208 --> 14:55.417
Rush and I had a verbal cue.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.041
She could see me,
so that's how I got him.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.125
What was the
verbal cue?

15:00.208 --> 15:01.583
It was "Hey."

15:01.667 --> 15:03.375
"Hey?"

15:05.208 --> 15:08.417
And when did you
establish this verbal
cue?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.917
It was, uh, that morning..

15:11.000 --> 15:12.125
...in her apartment.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.959
What were you doing in
your partner's
apartment?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.291
In the morning?

15:18.375 --> 15:20.041
Her mother died.

15:20.125 --> 15:21.250
I was checking in on her.

15:21.333 --> 15:24.250
I had time saved up,
don't worry.

15:24.333 --> 15:26.875
Does your Lieutenant know
that
you violated the perimeter

15:26.959 --> 15:28.709
established by SWAT
when you came upstairs

15:28.792 --> 15:29.917
the evening of May 12th?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.625
Yeah.

15:31.709 --> 15:34.834
You disobey orders
often,
Detective Valens?

15:34.917 --> 15:36.083
What're you talking about?

15:36.166 --> 15:37.750
You know, like when
you told Mitch Hathaway

15:37.834 --> 15:40.417
that his son was molested
and murdered by Cliff
Burrell.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.500
Who told you that?

15:44.583 --> 15:46.166
You sent a murderer
on a vigilante mission

15:46.250 --> 15:48.000
that nearly ended in a man
getting thrown off a roof.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.834
- Is that in my record?
- Oh, I can't tell you
that.

15:50.917 --> 15:54.041
Only supervisors have
access to personnel files.

15:56.625 --> 15:59.750
Have you ever had counseling
for your anger problem?

16:00.959 --> 16:02.875
Screw you.

16:02.959 --> 16:05.208
Go find out who stole the
quarters from the piggy bank.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.458
Carrie Swett.

16:27.542 --> 16:29.208
I think about that
all the time.

16:30.458 --> 16:31.542
So tragic.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.041
She was a member
of your virginity club?

16:34.125 --> 16:36.417
Hearts Wait Club.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.959
She came to a few
meetings, sure.

16:39.041 --> 16:42.083
How's a girl like Carrie
wind up at your club?

16:42.166 --> 16:45.041
I asked her in
the hall one day.

16:45.125 --> 16:47.834
You didn't have to
have your V-card.

16:47.917 --> 16:49.583
That like Amex?

16:49.667 --> 16:51.959
You could re-virginize.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.250
Take a vow
and erase the
past.

16:55.917 --> 16:58.333
Carrie was
really into
that.

16:58.417 --> 17:02.166
I can't imagine how hard it
is to be a girl right now.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.542
You're trying to wait for
love,
and you turn on the TV

17:04.625 --> 17:08.333
and you see singers and
actresses giving it up for
free.

17:09.375 --> 17:10.500
(Manny)
'How about us?'

17:10.583 --> 17:11.625
'Trying to stay strong'

17:11.709 --> 17:13.041
when even
the President can't.

17:13.125 --> 17:14.917
And that's
why
we're here.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.333
'Because it's easier'

17:16.417 --> 17:19.250
I think to make a
commitment and stay strong

17:19.333 --> 17:20.625
with other people
by your side.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.333
Definitely.
Like a diet.

17:24.417 --> 17:27.333
'Nathan, I don't
know why anyone'

17:27.417 --> 17:30.458
isn't talking about
"That woman," Monica Lewinsky.

17:30.542 --> 17:33.125
'My father was seduced
by a girl like that'

17:33.208 --> 17:35.792
who knew he was married.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.208
Why would someone do that?

17:38.291 --> 17:39.333
(Carrie)
'I know why.'

17:40.792 --> 17:42.083
You're lonely.

17:43.834 --> 17:45.125
You want affection.

17:45.208 --> 17:48.583
And you think that
after it'll be different.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.458
- They'll like you.
- And do they?

17:53.959 --> 17:55.125
No.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.375
And usually you don't
even like yourself.

18:06.917 --> 18:09.125
God sees you

18:09.208 --> 18:10.834
and He doesn't judge you.

18:10.917 --> 18:13.291
He forgives the things
that you regret.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.083
I feel so dirty.

18:20.709 --> 18:22.875
I want to start over.

18:22.959 --> 18:24.500
You can.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.834
(Rush)
'So, this Nathan..'

18:36.917 --> 18:39.500
Nathan O'Donnell.

18:39.583 --> 18:42.417
He was the Youth Pastor.
We loved him.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.375
He was only 22, but we
thought he was very grown up.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.250
He was the one who gave out
the purity rings?

18:47.333 --> 18:51.291
Yeah. You went to his
office,
took your purity oath.

18:51.375 --> 18:53.375
- After hours?
- Yeah.

18:53.458 --> 18:56.500
It was you,
Nathan and God.

18:59.375 --> 19:00.625
It wasn't weird.

19:00.709 --> 19:03.667
No, nothing weird about that.

19:25.792 --> 19:26.875
Nathan O'Donnell?

19:28.500 --> 19:29.458
Philly PD.

19:29.542 --> 19:31.667
Got a few questions
we'd like to ask.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.125
Sure.

19:33.208 --> 19:35.500
Carrie Swett.

19:35.583 --> 19:37.166
Oh.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.667
I remember her, of course.

19:38.750 --> 19:41.500
Why don't you come downtown with
us take us down memory lane?

19:41.583 --> 19:43.792
Wait, I, um..

19:43.875 --> 19:46.041
She attended a handful
of Hearts Wait Club
meetings

19:46.125 --> 19:48.250
but I didn't,
I didn't really know
her.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.333
So, just a coincidence
you left the school a month

19:50.417 --> 19:51.500
after Carrie was murdered?

19:51.583 --> 19:53.041
No, actually.

19:54.917 --> 19:57.125
It was rattling.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.750
Made me really
search for
answers.

19:59.834 --> 20:00.875
Us, too. Come on.

20:00.959 --> 20:02.208
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

20:02.291 --> 20:04.792
Look...I remember

20:04.875 --> 20:08.125
that things
changed
in the group

20:08.208 --> 20:09.333
just before she was killed.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.959
Changed, how?

20:11.041 --> 20:12.792
I-I don't know if
this means
anything

20:12.875 --> 20:16.041
but, um,
that last
meeting

20:16.125 --> 20:19.458
the mood was weird,
and Carrie was
different.

20:19.542 --> 20:20.667
What do you mean?

20:20.750 --> 20:22.375
I used to have
them share
secrets.

20:22.458 --> 20:24.458
It was a trust exercise.

20:24.542 --> 20:27.583
But, uh, Carrie
stopped trusting
us.

20:31.875 --> 20:36.500
Sometimes I feel like
I don't work out enough.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.333
And I'm gross.

20:38.417 --> 20:39.500
Okay.

20:39.583 --> 20:42.375
I think my parents
are mad I don't do

20:42.458 --> 20:44.125
more extracurriculars.

20:44.208 --> 20:45.458
Um...I don't know.

20:45.542 --> 20:49.041
I guess I feel like
nobody knows me truly.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.250
Sometimes I feel so
overwhelmed with life

20:53.333 --> 20:56.542
I wanna go to sleep
and never wake up.

20:56.625 --> 20:59.417
Those are your deep,
dark secrets?

20:59.500 --> 21:03.250
I thought this club was about
trust and being your true
self.

21:03.333 --> 21:06.417
Why aren't you
guys being
real?

21:06.500 --> 21:09.333
What about when you have
something in your mind

21:09.417 --> 21:11.000
that you can't share?

21:12.542 --> 21:15.291
God can lift that weight
off your shoulders.

21:17.458 --> 21:21.166
Write down something
that only God can hear.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.125
Are you sure no one's
gonna read these?

21:36.208 --> 21:37.917
I'm sure.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.041
Now, when you're done,
put them in there.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.792
I'll see you next week.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.083
Oh, my God.

22:18.291 --> 22:19.333
No.

22:20.917 --> 22:22.166
Carrie!

22:25.500 --> 22:27.583
She read that thing,
turned pale as a
ghost.

22:27.667 --> 22:31.250
You're saying she read one
of these kids' secrets?

22:31.333 --> 22:32.375
You still got that can?

22:32.458 --> 22:33.458
No, it was years ago.

22:33.542 --> 22:34.667
I threw it away.

22:34.750 --> 22:36.750
Didn't want to see
what Carrie read?

22:36.834 --> 22:38.458
[sighs]
No, I..

22:38.542 --> 22:39.917
I guess I was thinking

22:40.000 --> 22:42.792
"How serious could a teenager's
secret really be?"

22:42.875 --> 22:46.250
Well, whatever it was,
Carrie was dead that night.

22:46.333 --> 22:48.542
Meaning whoever wrote it
took it pretty serious.

22:57.458 --> 23:00.041
Our Hearts Wait Club kids
are all here, boss.

23:00.125 --> 23:02.458
One of these do-gooders
took out Carrie Swett

23:02.542 --> 23:04.458
'cause she found
out their secret.

23:04.542 --> 23:06.792
(Rush)
'Not very
Christian of them.'

23:06.875 --> 23:09.375
At the very least, they might
have something on each other.

23:09.458 --> 23:12.125
So remind them it's not
high school anymore.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.625
Put on the heat

23:13.709 --> 23:15.834
they'll probably snitch
on each other in a
second.

23:32.083 --> 23:34.792
My secret was about how
I felt strange about sex.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.250
I had guilt issues.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.250
Big deal,
I was raised Catholic.

23:38.333 --> 23:41.250
Laurie, we think
someone killed Carrie

23:41.333 --> 23:42.667
for a secret she read.

23:43.792 --> 23:44.709
We were kids.

23:44.792 --> 23:46.500
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

23:46.583 --> 23:50.834
You're saying nobody in that
group had something to hide?

23:50.917 --> 23:54.000
There were things you
just didn't talk about..

23:54.083 --> 23:55.667
...but Carrie did.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.208
Like what?

23:58.834 --> 24:01.333
Have you spoken with
Phil DiPreta?

24:01.417 --> 24:02.709
You think we should?

24:02.792 --> 24:05.542
No one else thought
it was a secret

24:05.625 --> 24:07.583
how Phil was.

24:07.667 --> 24:10.166
But he did.

24:10.250 --> 24:13.375
One time after the first
meeting Carrie came to

24:13.458 --> 24:15.166
she made a big mistake.

24:37.208 --> 24:41.875
I'm trying to swear off
guys,
too, especially that one.

24:41.959 --> 24:43.709
What? Come on.

24:43.792 --> 24:45.709
I know you're afraid
to just tell the club

24:45.792 --> 24:47.166
but you should
just be honest.

24:48.750 --> 24:50.583
I am honest.

24:50.667 --> 24:51.709
I don't know
what you mean.

24:51.792 --> 24:54.041
Sorry, I gotta go.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.667
It's okay to be gay.

24:55.750 --> 24:57.667
What? Shut up.

24:57.750 --> 24:58.875
Oh, sorry, I..

24:58.959 --> 25:02.125
I am not..
I am not that!

25:02.208 --> 25:04.458
You're just some nobody,
so shut your mouth.

25:13.166 --> 25:16.166
- Phil's gay?
- No.

25:16.250 --> 25:17.542
Ask him.

25:17.625 --> 25:20.083
He'll tell you it's
the biggest sin there is.

25:22.542 --> 25:25.667
You're saying
Carrie was off
base?

25:25.750 --> 25:28.875
I am married with two kids.
What do you think?

25:28.959 --> 25:31.917
So it didn't bother
you,
her calling you a
gay?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.542
Yeah, of course it did.

25:33.625 --> 25:36.917
So maybe the two of you get
into
a fight, it gets out of hand.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.583
No. No way.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.875
Laurie said you were livid

25:40.959 --> 25:43.000
says you're against
all that stuff.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.208
Laurie?

25:46.208 --> 25:48.000
Well, of course Laurie would
tell you to talk to me.

25:48.083 --> 25:49.291
She got something
against you?

25:49.375 --> 25:51.125
She had something
against Carrie.

25:51.208 --> 25:52.500
Her and Manny.

25:52.583 --> 25:54.333
The boyfriend?

25:54.417 --> 25:58.375
Pretended to be Mary
and Joseph, so perfect.

25:58.458 --> 26:00.333
But that's not the case.

26:00.417 --> 26:01.875
And Carrie Swett
knew all about it.

26:19.333 --> 26:20.417
Are you okay?

26:23.291 --> 26:24.667
I'm freaked out.

26:24.750 --> 26:25.917
What's wrong?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.500
Did you have a fight
with Manny?

26:29.542 --> 26:32.083
How do you know
if you're pregnant?

26:32.166 --> 26:33.667
You can't be pregnant.

26:33.750 --> 26:35.333
- You guys don't--
- No, we do.

26:37.417 --> 26:39.625
'I know, I'm a
terrible person.'

26:39.709 --> 26:43.417
I say I won't, and then
when we're together I want
to.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.291
No, you just need
to use protection.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.458
He won't talk about it.

26:49.542 --> 26:51.375
After we do it, he cries.

26:51.458 --> 26:54.667
Why?
You guys are in love.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.291
I think you're lucky.

26:56.375 --> 26:57.667
I'm not.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.083
[sniffling]
I'm dirty.

27:02.417 --> 27:03.792
What are you guys
talking about?

27:06.166 --> 27:07.250
You told her, didn't you?

27:07.333 --> 27:08.959
- It's okay, Manny--
- Don't..

27:09.041 --> 27:12.792
...talk to my girlfriend
ever
again or I'll make you pay.

27:28.625 --> 27:29.875
(Vera)
'So Manny didn't want anyone'

27:29.959 --> 27:32.709
to know about them
knocking boots?

27:32.792 --> 27:37.125
He was the most repressed,
controlled person ever.

27:37.208 --> 27:40.291
And that can poison
you on the inside.

27:40.375 --> 27:41.458
I think.

27:53.959 --> 27:57.125
Carrie Swett knew that you
and Laurie were making a mockery

27:57.208 --> 27:58.667
out of the club.

27:58.750 --> 28:00.417
Had a pregnancy scare?

28:00.500 --> 28:02.875
I was ashamed of that.

28:02.959 --> 28:04.917
We were lucky it
was just a scare.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.959
Ashamed enough
to pick Carrie off

28:07.041 --> 28:08.583
and let your secret
die with her?

28:08.667 --> 28:11.083
Not at all.

28:11.166 --> 28:12.750
I slipped, yes.

28:12.834 --> 28:15.000
Sure did...a few times.

28:15.083 --> 28:19.083
I lost my way in high school but
I found my way back through God.

28:19.166 --> 28:20.667
Seems like once
Carrie showed up

28:20.750 --> 28:23.333
quite a few of you
"Lost your way."

28:24.959 --> 28:28.792
Anything you'd like to
get off your chest, Manny?

28:28.875 --> 28:31.041
I usually try to stay
away from female drama

28:31.125 --> 28:35.291
but one time after school
I saw something kind of
weird.

28:41.208 --> 28:42.625
(Tina)
'Carrie!'

28:42.709 --> 28:44.083
'Don't just run
away from me.'

28:44.166 --> 28:45.458
(Carrie)
'I don't get it.'

28:45.542 --> 28:46.792
'You made me feel
like I was the bad--'

28:46.875 --> 28:49.500
Carrie, come
back.
Carrie!

28:49.583 --> 28:51.542
You're looking for love
in the wrong place.

28:51.625 --> 28:52.750
You're just like me.

28:52.834 --> 28:54.709
I am nothing like you.

28:54.792 --> 28:57.458
It was wrong and I am telling.

28:57.542 --> 28:58.875
No one will believe you.

28:58.959 --> 29:01.250
You're just some slut
with a whore for a mother.

29:07.041 --> 29:09.959
After Carrie died,
Tina kind of went funny.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.041
What do you mean?

29:11.125 --> 29:12.583
She walked around, like

29:12.667 --> 29:15.500
with her hair all dirty
and not talking to
anybody.

29:15.583 --> 29:17.959
You don't think she was
just mourning her friend?

29:18.041 --> 29:20.333
They weren't friends.

29:20.417 --> 29:24.166
Tina's friends play by her
rules
or they don't play at all.

29:24.250 --> 29:26.083
'Carrie was done.'

29:42.250 --> 29:44.375
No.

29:44.458 --> 29:48.000
No, I am not
a person who yells.

29:48.083 --> 29:49.458
I am not a person
who shoves.

29:49.542 --> 29:50.625
That is not me.

29:50.709 --> 29:52.667
Witness saw
you, Tina.

29:52.750 --> 29:55.250
(Rush)
'You were looking for
love in the wrong place.'

29:55.333 --> 29:58.041
Maybe you didn't
deserve that ring?

29:58.125 --> 30:00.333
I was a virgin
until my wedding night.

30:00.417 --> 30:03.041
You cannot slander
my character.

30:03.125 --> 30:04.542
And where'd you say
your hubby was now?

30:04.625 --> 30:05.875
He's in Iraq.

30:07.792 --> 30:11.959
Oh, Tina, you just tell
yourself lies, don't you?

30:12.041 --> 30:15.166
We got the papers
from the courthouse.

30:15.250 --> 30:19.583
He filed for an
annulment
three months ago.

30:19.667 --> 30:22.375
He says the marriage
was never consummated.

30:22.458 --> 30:25.333
Can't let go of that
purity pledge, huh,
Tina?

30:25.417 --> 30:27.000
That's none of
your business.

30:27.083 --> 30:29.166
What happened to you?

30:29.250 --> 30:32.041
Why are you stuck in time
like the club never ended?

30:32.125 --> 30:36.083
- Some kind of trauma?
- Yeah...actually.

30:36.166 --> 30:37.834
But you guys don't
even see it.

30:39.834 --> 30:41.875
I'm having these..

30:41.959 --> 30:43.750
...thoughts and dreams
and I'm not sure

30:43.834 --> 30:45.375
if it's the devil
inside of me

30:45.458 --> 30:48.000
or if it's God
guiding me or what.

30:51.667 --> 30:52.917
What kind of thoughts?

30:57.500 --> 30:58.458
Sex thoughts.

30:59.875 --> 31:02.417
Okay.
That's
normal.

31:02.500 --> 31:03.750
About you.

31:03.834 --> 31:06.208
It's not normal.

31:06.291 --> 31:07.291
What's wrong with me?

31:07.375 --> 31:09.000
Hey, hey, hey.

31:09.083 --> 31:10.458
You don't even
have to look at
me.

31:10.542 --> 31:13.500
You can turn
around if you
want.

31:14.166 --> 31:16.166
Okay?

31:16.250 --> 31:18.458
Okay.

31:27.250 --> 31:30.125
In one of them

31:30.208 --> 31:33.500
we were in my house

31:33.583 --> 31:36.875
and I was like..

31:36.959 --> 31:39.792
"Let's go for a swim."

31:39.875 --> 31:42.083
(Nathan)
'In the pool?'

31:43.542 --> 31:45.625
And then..

31:45.709 --> 31:49.000
I was like..

31:49.083 --> 31:52.709
"Don't wear your bathing suit,
Nathan, and I won't wear mine."

31:52.792 --> 31:53.959
(Nathan)
'Uh-huh.'

31:55.375 --> 31:57.291
'Go on.'

31:57.375 --> 31:58.875
So we were both
in the pool--

31:59.000 --> 32:00.250
I..

32:00.333 --> 32:02.959
Sorry, are you..

32:03.041 --> 32:04.750
Nathan!

32:04.834 --> 32:06.000
Oh, my God.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.250
What is wrong with you?

32:09.417 --> 32:10.458
Carrie!

32:10.542 --> 32:11.917
Carrie!

32:13.583 --> 32:16.542
Nathan was insanely mad.

32:16.625 --> 32:20.875
Said he'd never be able to be
hired as a minister if she
told.

32:20.959 --> 32:23.917
Did he say anything
after she was
killed?

32:24.000 --> 32:25.667
I don't know.

32:25.750 --> 32:28.417
He disbanded the club.

32:28.500 --> 32:31.875
Put in for a transfer the
day
after her body was found.

32:42.125 --> 32:44.875
You told these kids to
trust you as a man of
God.

32:44.959 --> 32:47.083
You were a snake in the grass.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.625
I was weak.

32:48.709 --> 32:50.709
Tina..

32:50.792 --> 32:52.417
'...kept coming to my
office every week'

32:52.500 --> 32:54.208
with these elaborate stories.

32:54.291 --> 32:57.291
Oh, right, so now
Tina's to blame.

32:57.375 --> 32:59.709
No, it was my fault.

33:01.125 --> 33:04.000
Tina was a troubled girl

33:04.083 --> 33:07.792
and instead of helping her,
I took advantage.

33:07.875 --> 33:10.917
Carrie Swett knew what you were
doing and you beat her to death.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.750
I am to blame
for their corruption

33:14.834 --> 33:17.375
but I did not lay a hand
on Carrie Swett.

33:17.458 --> 33:19.542
You saying one of them
did?
The kids?

33:25.166 --> 33:29.208
I was supposed to be their
guide and I was so lost.

33:35.291 --> 33:37.041
Nathan, if you know
anything about it

33:37.125 --> 33:38.583
you need to do right by her.

33:41.792 --> 33:42.917
I read it.

33:44.333 --> 33:46.125
The secret Carrie found.

33:46.917 --> 33:47.959
When?

33:48.041 --> 33:49.792
The day she disappeared
after the meeting.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.583
I thought maybe Tina had
written
something about me, so..

34:02.542 --> 34:04.333
What did it say?

34:08.625 --> 34:10.750
"Carrie is going to die."

34:12.500 --> 34:13.625
Which one wrote it?

34:14.625 --> 34:15.834
I don't know.

34:17.083 --> 34:18.792
I kept them hidden away.

34:20.875 --> 34:22.542
God, forgive me.

34:41.208 --> 34:43.959
Well, one of you confessed.

34:44.041 --> 34:47.166
"Carrie is going to die."

34:47.250 --> 34:49.625
You wrote it down.

34:49.709 --> 34:53.375
You wanted God to
take your burden away

34:53.458 --> 34:54.750
but He didn't.

34:56.667 --> 34:58.625
Did He, Phil?

34:58.709 --> 35:00.375
- I didn't write that.
- Phil.

35:00.458 --> 35:01.709
Calm down.

35:03.542 --> 35:04.959
You used to be good kids.

35:06.250 --> 35:09.125
Good students,
traditional values.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.417
'What happened?'

35:11.834 --> 35:13.166
Carrie happened.

35:13.250 --> 35:15.333
She came and corrupted you.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.917
Talking to you
about premarital sex

35:18.000 --> 35:19.959
and you about being gay

35:20.041 --> 35:23.417
and, well, you.

35:23.500 --> 35:24.834
Everybody knows about you.

35:30.959 --> 35:34.375
No? Oh, you didn't share
with the group?

35:36.500 --> 35:39.834
Carrie saw you and Nathan..

35:42.041 --> 35:45.750
Nathan crossed a line
with me, that is true.

35:45.834 --> 35:48.750
And you came back every
week to let him cross it.

35:48.834 --> 35:51.875
Little Miss Virginity
exposed by the slut.

35:51.959 --> 35:53.750
- Please.
- Right?

35:53.834 --> 35:58.875
Why is it some great mystery,
how some screwed-up girl died?

35:58.959 --> 36:01.875
Didn't just die,
she was stoned to death.

36:01.959 --> 36:04.291
Kind of fitting.
But you know that.

36:04.375 --> 36:06.125
She was a corruptive
influence on all of us.

36:06.208 --> 36:07.834
No, she wasn't.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.333
What we were doing
wasn't corrupt.

36:13.583 --> 36:14.917
True.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
It wasn't until you
went into the woods.

36:19.166 --> 36:20.417
See her footprints.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.709
Oh, she ran like hell,
didn't she?

36:22.792 --> 36:26.542
Then she stopped and
changed directions here

36:26.625 --> 36:29.375
here, here and here.

36:31.875 --> 36:33.083
Four times.

36:33.166 --> 36:35.417
Something got in her way.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.250
Something strong,
wouldn't let her escape.

36:38.333 --> 36:41.125
One, two, three,
four obstacles.

36:41.208 --> 36:44.125
You were all there
in the woods with her.

36:44.208 --> 36:48.083
You killed
Carrie Swett together.

36:48.166 --> 36:52.375
You all made Carrie
die for your sins.

36:54.041 --> 36:57.834
You have to confess..

36:57.917 --> 36:59.125
...to be forgiven.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.500
I hated her
for using that word.

37:20.458 --> 37:22.542
Gay.

37:22.625 --> 37:25.250
So I tricked Carrie into
coming to the woods with me.

37:28.291 --> 37:30.709
I don't want
to be
different.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.166
I don't want
to be alone.

37:33.250 --> 37:35.041
You don't have to be.

37:35.125 --> 37:37.166
You can love someone.

37:37.250 --> 37:38.583
You can be who you are.

37:48.417 --> 37:49.750
You want to go for a walk?

37:53.041 --> 37:54.166
Sure.

38:02.291 --> 38:03.500
(Valens)
'And then what?'

38:03.583 --> 38:05.834
- I can't do this.
- Manny, don't.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.000
Please stay.

38:07.959 --> 38:09.041
I wrote it down.

38:11.792 --> 38:14.208
What we were
going to do.

38:15.917 --> 38:17.667
I wanted someone to stop us.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.709
I waited for her..

38:24.792 --> 38:26.625
...with Tina.

38:27.875 --> 38:30.208
'Tina convinced us.'

38:30.291 --> 38:33.542
I wanted to get rid
of Carrie, too.

38:33.625 --> 38:36.333
'And everything
she reminded me of'

38:36.417 --> 38:38.875
'but then we were in
the woods and it was real'

38:38.959 --> 38:42.166
and I wanted to run,
but my feet wouldn't--

38:42.250 --> 38:43.417
Shut up!

38:43.500 --> 38:44.542
Shut up!

38:44.625 --> 38:46.208
What are we gonna do
when she gets here?

38:46.291 --> 38:47.417
What are we gonna do?

38:47.500 --> 38:49.041
We kill her.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.542
We stepped out of the shadows..

39:00.917 --> 39:02.792
'...and I think
right away she knew.'

39:13.000 --> 39:15.166
And then we made
a circle around her.

39:29.542 --> 39:30.750
I don't know who
started yelling

39:30.834 --> 39:32.792
'but we were just
calling her names.'

39:32.875 --> 39:35.166
- 'Bitch.'
- 'Slut.'

39:35.250 --> 39:36.834
- 'You're dirty.'
- Whore!

39:40.208 --> 39:41.458
Please, Phil, help me.

39:41.542 --> 39:43.041
What are you doing?

39:43.125 --> 39:46.375
You have to stop saying things
to me that are not true!

39:48.417 --> 39:49.500
Laurie.

39:49.583 --> 39:53.125
You poisoned us and
now God doesn't love us.

39:53.208 --> 39:55.291
You guys..

39:55.375 --> 39:56.458
Please!

39:59.125 --> 40:01.125
And then..

40:01.208 --> 40:02.417
I hit her.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.792
You're taking him away from me!

40:06.375 --> 40:08.750
We can't..

40:08.834 --> 40:10.166
'Deuteronomy.'

40:11.375 --> 40:14.667
'A whore should be stoned.'

40:14.750 --> 40:18.041
"So shall thou put
evil away among you!"

40:20.542 --> 40:22.125
No!

40:27.000 --> 40:28.041
Do it!

40:33.125 --> 40:34.834
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

40:43.333 --> 40:45.208
She's still..

40:46.917 --> 40:48.166
She's still breathing.

40:48.250 --> 40:49.500
Manny, do something.

40:53.417 --> 40:55.166
- Manny!
- I can't!

41:07.625 --> 41:09.250
(Manny)
'I let her die in the
woods.'

41:09.333 --> 41:11.291
(Phil)
'I hit her. I helped kill
her,
it was a blur.'

41:11.375 --> 41:14.375
(Laurie)
'I killed her.
I don't know why I did.'

41:14.458 --> 41:15.917
(Tina)
'I killed Carrie.'

41:18.125 --> 41:20.834
(all)
'I killed Carrie Swett.'
