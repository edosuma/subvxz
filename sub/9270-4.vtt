Don't... Don't, sir.

00:44.080 --> 00:48.150
I'm sorry... I'm sorry, sir.

I'm so sorry, sir. I'm so sorry.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.710
Well, isn't this cosy?

01:30.760 --> 01:32.670
Sid has plenty of room in the front.

01:32.720 --> 01:36.510
Oh, no, I'm perfectly comfortable
here, thank you.

01:36.560 --> 01:40.910
It'll be a real privilege to finally
meet the great St Clare.

01:40.960 --> 01:45.830
I heard he killed 20 Nazis
with the Broken Sword.

01:45.880 --> 01:50.180
I doubt anyone could kill 20 men
in combat with a sword.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.460
'Ello...

02:01.440 --> 02:03.040
It's not a race...

02:13.280 --> 02:16.150
Company... halt!

02:16.200 --> 02:18.440
March! Left, right...

02:19.210 --> 02:23.310
Oi! No. You can't park here,
this is a parade ground.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.030
How am I supposed to know that?

02:25.080 --> 02:29.070
Good morning. I'm RSM Davis,
this is Lieutenant Graham.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.950
~ Father Brown.
~ Lady Felicia Montague.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.100
Mrs McCarthy, parish secretary.

02:33.150 --> 02:36.470
It's an honour to be invited to
such a solemn occasion.

02:36.520 --> 02:39.470
The Kembles appreciate the
fundraising you've done for the
memorial.

02:39.520 --> 02:40.710
It's really nothing.

02:40.760 --> 02:44.870
We'll be starting with reception at
1100 hours, lunch at 1200.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.550
Then there'll be a display
of marksmanship at 1245.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.910
Then we'll reconvene at St Mary's
for the memorial 1600.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.670
Oh, four o'clock.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.590
The unveiling of the Dunkirk
Memorial will be at 1800.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.590
As long as I'm back at St Mary's
by two o'clock.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.990
Ooh.. 0.1400 hours.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.910
Do you want to show me where I'm
supposed to park the thing?

03:03.960 --> 03:06.230
Do I look like a skivvy?

03:06.280 --> 03:10.230
The Colonel said our guests were to
be shown every courtesy, sir.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.750
I gather you served in the Glosters,
Father? A fine regiment.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.110
Indeed.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.910
Yes, I was in the trenches
in Flanders in the first war

03:17.960 --> 03:20.710
and a chaplain in the second.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.860
Would you like to follow me?

03:25.570 --> 03:28.870
So, where did you
do your national service?

03:28.920 --> 03:30.710
Not here, that's for sure.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.750
CARTER SNORTS

03:32.800 --> 03:34.900
So, you shirked your duties.

03:35.230 --> 03:39.430
Impressive. One look at Carter
and you've sized him up.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.510
Carter.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.030
Sullivan.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.350
The Third was almost surrounded.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.910
We were half a day's
march from the beaches at Dunkirk.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.590
There was a Panzer division
closing in on our position.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.910
The only way out was
a country bridge,

03:52.960 --> 03:56.270
held by a German unit,
their reinforcements minutes away.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.020
Colonel St Clare led from the front.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.630
The Colonel always
leads from the front!

04:02.680 --> 04:07.900
When he ran out of bullets, he used
his sword. It broke on German bones.

04:07.950 --> 04:11.150
Unusual to carry
a sword into battle, surely?

04:11.200 --> 04:15.310
Yes. Some mocked him.
But not after Dunkirk.

04:15.360 --> 04:20.070
Dark days indeed. We needed
all the heroes we could find.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.510
Brave man.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.750
It's down to him
so many of us got out alive.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.280
Yes. Less than half of us.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.880
At ease, gentlemen.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.940
Welcome.

04:42.990 --> 04:46.750
A lot of people
talk about me and the Broken Sword.

04:46.800 --> 04:51.790
But we are gathered to honour those
brave men who didn't come home.

04:51.840 --> 04:56.200
Dulce et decorum est pro
patria mori.

04:59.890 --> 05:04.790
It's probably best to keep an eye
on Major Rawlings. He's drunk.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.940
He's going to cause trouble.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.350
Hope it's the good stuff.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.000
It's for the guests.

05:12.090 --> 05:14.190
Thank you.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.340
Felicia?

05:16.640 --> 05:19.430
Has it really been 13 years?

05:19.480 --> 05:22.670
Looking at you, I'd swear
it couldn't possibly be so long.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.710
Charming as ever, Laurence.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.860
Shall we?

05:31.450 --> 05:35.750
Some of the men wondered
if we'd ever see Blighty again.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.400
Outnumbered, trapped...

05:38.560 --> 05:42.460
Then we saw the Colonel
striding out of the trees.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.750
You, sir, were a giant.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.430
If the Jerries thought the Third
would go down without a fight

05:47.480 --> 05:49.030
they had another thing coming.

05:49.080 --> 05:52.990
We would have followed you to
the ends of the earth.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.430
You made us believe.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.200
A toast. To our great hero.

06:00.590 --> 06:03.990
Who lets us
all bask in his reflected glory.

06:04.040 --> 06:07.990
~ Sit down.
~ Without him and his sword,
none of us would be here.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.760
Get a grip, man.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.870
St Clare cannot stand
the truth, it embarrasses him!

06:14.920 --> 06:16.270
Enough!

06:16.320 --> 06:22.190
The truth, that we owe it all,
our lives, our glory, to him.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.630
To St Clare. And the Broken Sword.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.950
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.550
for those who wish to attend,
the men of the Third will now

06:29.600 --> 06:33.400
display their marksmanship
at the shooting range.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.910
I hope you don't mind me
being so... forward

06:39.960 --> 06:43.230
but you seem very
agitated by something.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.880
Is there anything I can do to help?

06:47.190 --> 06:51.990
Unless you can take me back
to before the charge of the Third,

06:52.040 --> 06:53.950
then I doubt you can help me,
Father.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.640
But thank you.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.220
Rawlings?

07:06.400 --> 07:09.000
Rawlings, do not walk away from me!

07:09.430 --> 07:13.830
I'd quite like to see the display,
could we stay an hour?

07:13.880 --> 07:15.710
It's not really my sort of thing.

07:15.760 --> 07:20.190
~ I'll just get back to St Mary's and
get everything ready. Enjoy!
~ Thank you.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.240
Just keep your mouth shut!

07:26.200 --> 07:28.870
I'll deal with you later, Major.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.390
Sergeant, there's been
an incident at the museum.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.110
The sword's been stolen.

07:33.160 --> 07:36.470
OK. Thank you, Sergeant.
I'm sorry, I'm needed in the museum.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.670
The Sergeant will escort you
to the shooting range.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.820
Thank you.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.220
Shall we?

07:45.240 --> 07:47.640
BARKED COMMANDS IN DISTANCE

07:51.440 --> 07:54.000
Oh, I do love a man in uniform.

07:55.390 --> 07:57.990
Everything in hand, Sergeant Major?

07:58.040 --> 08:01.040
Yes, m'lady.
Have you the time, Father?

08:02.130 --> 08:04.230
12:43.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.670
You haven't seen the colonel?

08:05.720 --> 08:08.550
~ 'Fraid not.
~ Can't you just start without him?

08:08.600 --> 08:10.990
No, we can't just start without him.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.350
All right, please yourself.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.070
How about you keep your mouth shut?

08:14.120 --> 08:16.220
Oh, hello..

08:16.720 --> 08:19.230
I don't take orders from you.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.270
Here, you do.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.110
CARTER SNORTS

08:22.160 --> 08:26.360
I see, you think cos you're army
you're better than me?

08:27.200 --> 08:29.510
He's quick, this one, eh?

08:29.560 --> 08:32.750
I don't like guys that duck
out of national service.

08:32.799 --> 08:36.950
That's as bad as cowardice.
And I despise cowards.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.760
~ Sid.
~ Calm down, Father, let Mr
Carter stand up for himself.

08:41.809 --> 08:46.990
If you two still want to lock horns,
we can settle it with a contest.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.030
I've got more important
things to do.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.750
Just what I thought. All mouth.

08:51.800 --> 08:56.800
How about five shots each then
fastest around the assault course?

08:58.160 --> 09:00.260
I'm in.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.100
~ I don't think this is...
~ Shhhh. It'll be fun.

09:07.690 --> 09:09.790
Is he a good shot, your man?

09:09.840 --> 09:12.350
Many a rabbit stew testifies
to his prowess.

09:12.400 --> 09:16.110
GUNSHOTS

09:16.160 --> 09:19.110
Lieutenant Graham's no more than
capable.

09:19.160 --> 09:23.510
And he's never been the fastest
on the assault course. The driver?

09:23.560 --> 09:25.760
Sid the Whippet, we call him.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.380
Apologies.
I was unavoidably delayed.

09:31.150 --> 09:32.750
Army versus civvy street?

09:32.800 --> 09:35.350
Yes, sir. Shooting, then once round
the assault course.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.500
Excellent.

09:39.480 --> 09:42.380
Do you care to make this
interesting?

09:42.920 --> 09:46.120
I'll have one pound
on Lieutenant Graham.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.200
If you'd do the honours, Father.

09:54.930 --> 09:59.630
I hope you're not going to give me
the cold shoulder all day.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.590
You have good reason to be angry.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.750
Oh, I'm not angry, Laurence.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.990
When you didn't come back, well,
message received loud and clear.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.640
No explanation necessary.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.590
Felicia, the war...

10:13.640 --> 10:16.080
Oh, the war(!)

10:21.400 --> 10:23.000
How did they do?

10:24.280 --> 10:27.390
Five clean hits each, no bullseyes.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.430
I make that a tie.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.080
Now we have a contest.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.320
Five bullseyes. Jolly well done.

10:54.010 --> 10:56.510
Whenever you're ready, gentlemen.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.240
A WOMAN SCREAMS

11:07.190 --> 11:08.790
Get the medics.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.590
He's too late for medics.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.240
For Lady Felicia!

11:17.450 --> 11:19.750
Stabbed by the Colonel's sword.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.830
Yes, I can see that, thank you.
Look, could you get back, please,
Father?

11:22.880 --> 11:25.550
~ Lieutenant...
~ Have you seen anyone else?
~ No.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.710
I'll call my officers,
secure the scene.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.630
This is my jurisdiction, Inspector.

11:29.680 --> 11:33.310
Very well, Lieutenant, but I can
offer the full assistance of
the local constabulary.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.830
I can handle this, Inspector.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.310
Lieutenant, this man's immortal
soul...

11:38.360 --> 11:41.390
Is none of my concern.
Finding his killer, however, is.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.640
Let him continue, Lieutenant.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.340
Thank you.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.240
At least we know what time he died.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.990
Father?

12:05.040 --> 12:08.430
The Lieutenant wants everyone
in the officers' mess, please.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.790
The scabbard was stolen
with the sword.

12:10.840 --> 12:13.710
Yes, the theft was discovered at
12:30.

12:13.760 --> 12:17.880
So, the killer had
the sword from 12:30 until 12:43.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.030
And it appears the thief cut
themselves in the process.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.030
Perhaps you should check everyone
with a laceration.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.430
On an army base, Father?

12:29.480 --> 12:34.020
Have you any idea how many
of the men get injured every day?

12:34.070 --> 12:36.070
This'll steady your nerves.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.590
Thank you.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.150
Can I get you anything else, ma'am?

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
Oh, no, thank you, my dear.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.790
No, thank you.
I'd rather keep my wits about me.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.550
All the mess staff have alibis.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.790
~ They were here, in
the mess, clearing up.
~ All of them?

12:49.840 --> 12:52.910
From 12:30 when the sword was
stolen until 12:43,

12:52.960 --> 12:54.430
when the murder was committed?

12:54.480 --> 12:57.910
~ Yes.
~ The lieutenant made it quite
clear we were to keep our noses out.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.230
Technically,
he said to keep YOUR nose out.

13:00.280 --> 13:04.480
Everyone except military police
is to keep out of this.

13:05.110 --> 13:07.110
We'll be taking statements.

13:07.160 --> 13:10.470
The only people here that don't have
alibis for 12:43 are the Colonel...

13:10.520 --> 13:12.800
And, apparently, you.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.790
I didn't kill him.
I only met him this morning.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.070
You don't have an alibi.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.230
~ I was in the Rolls.
~ Anyone see you?

13:23.280 --> 13:26.150
~ I dunno.
~ Shame.
~ Look, if I needed a witness

13:26.200 --> 13:28.670
I'd have got his name,
rank and serial number.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.670
And anyway, even if I did want to
kill him, I wouldn't use
a broken sword!

13:31.720 --> 13:33.870
I'd have got a whole one,
wouldn't I?

13:33.920 --> 13:35.150
Well, you tell me.

13:35.200 --> 13:40.190
Look, if you think I did kill him,
then you tell me, why?

13:40.240 --> 13:41.840
No, I ask the que...

13:47.480 --> 13:49.580
Out.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.180
Out!

13:53.010 --> 13:56.510
It was dreadful. I almost
fell on top of him.

13:56.560 --> 14:01.150
You know, one thing I don't
understand, why steal the scabbard
as well?

14:01.200 --> 14:02.750
Easiest way to carry a sword.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.910
The killer might still have it.

14:04.960 --> 14:07.110
Perhaps you should tell
the Lieutenant, Father.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.110
I'm sure you'll be very welcome.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.760
This way, please, Father.

14:13.950 --> 14:19.150
12:43, RSM Davis informs me you
were at the shooting range with him.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.510
Did you see or hear anything?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.030
Yes.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.680
I saw you arrive just
after 12:43.

14:26.850 --> 14:28.950
Sorry?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.630
Well, the watch was smashed at 12:43,

14:31.680 --> 14:35.390
so, you had time to get from Major
Rawlings to the shooting range.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.040
Are you accusing me?

14:37.880 --> 14:39.990
I'm only trying to help.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.670
I am not a suspect.
You answer my questions.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.030
Surely everyone is a suspect?

14:46.080 --> 14:48.790
Have you established the whereabouts
of everyone on the base?

14:48.840 --> 14:52.940
The soldiers? Yes,
all their alibis have been conf...

14:54.640 --> 14:57.480
You answer my questions!

14:58.480 --> 15:00.580
Glad to.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.720
Excuse me, miss.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.580
Simone.

15:14.320 --> 15:17.190
I see you've hurt your hand, Simone.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.030
An accident in the kitchen, Father.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.910
Hope it's not too serious.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.600
Just a nick. Thank you.

15:22.650 --> 15:26.270
Will you be coming to St Mary's
for the service?

15:26.320 --> 15:27.710
I don't go to church any more.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.360
May I ask why?

15:30.280 --> 15:33.780
My father died in Dunkirk.
Where was God then?

15:35.400 --> 15:38.430
Sorry, I shouldn't have.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.430
Please come to the service.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.470
I want the day to
be about the families.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.590
Too often I think the military
forgets

15:44.640 --> 15:47.840
that their brave soldiers
have loved ones.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.800
I'll think about it.

15:54.430 --> 15:57.030
Sir, I'll take your statement next.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.310
Then you'll be free to return
to your duties.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.460
Good.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.510
Lieutenant, about the alibis...

16:05.560 --> 16:07.520
Please, don't interfere.

16:10.050 --> 16:12.950
Helping the Lieutenant again,
Father?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.750
Many hands make light work.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.400
Why not just shoot him?

16:18.410 --> 16:23.510
Perhaps the killer wanted Major
Rawlings to know why he was dying.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.030
And he was very vexed about Dunkirk.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.910
I can't think why.
It was the making of him.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.070
~ How?
~ His predecessor, Major
Murray, died in battle.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.670
Rawlings was promoted.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.320
Dead man's shoes.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.060
Observe...

16:52.840 --> 16:57.440
.. as the pupil
surpasses his master.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.109
Or perhaps not.

17:06.160 --> 17:09.109
I went straight from
the officers' mess to my office.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.710
I was there
until I left for the shooting range.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.359
I didn't see Rawlings.

17:13.890 --> 17:15.990
Are we done?

17:16.040 --> 17:19.630
No. That's your final word, sir?

17:19.680 --> 17:21.780
Yes.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.589
Where were you at 12:43?

17:24.640 --> 17:27.030
In my office, alone.

17:27.079 --> 17:31.470
Sir, I have information that says
you didn't go straight

17:31.520 --> 17:34.110
to your office
from the officers' mess.

17:34.160 --> 17:38.160
You were seen in an altercation
with Major Rawlings.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.640
Map of Dunkirk.

17:43.040 --> 17:45.040
He was obsessed by Dunkirk.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.990
All these units heading
towards evacuation.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.270
Except this company
of Royal Engineers,

17:52.320 --> 17:54.510
moving towards
the 9th Panzer Division.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.950
~ Why would you do that? I
thought it was an evacuation.
~ It was.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.470
A company of Royal Engineers
against a Panzer Division,

18:00.520 --> 18:03.710
that'd be lambs to the
slaughter.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.470
Father, what are you up to?

18:06.520 --> 18:09.350
I saw you sneaking out of the mess.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.150
~ I tried to be inconspicuous.
~ I noticed.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.070
If the Lieutenant finds you...

18:14.120 --> 18:17.350
I gather military prisons make
Kembleford cells look like the Ritz.

18:17.400 --> 18:21.870
Mind you, not even the Ritz
looks like the Ritz these days.

18:21.920 --> 18:25.430
Ah, breaking and entering, even
better.

18:25.480 --> 18:29.030
Nice of you to join us,
Inspector. What do you want?

18:29.080 --> 18:32.830
To see Lieutenant Graham
clap Father Brown in irons
and throw away the key?

18:32.880 --> 18:35.470
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.630
"13 years I have carried this
burden. I have told no-one.

18:38.680 --> 18:43.080
"But as you remember our comrades,
I cannot stay silent."

18:44.440 --> 18:46.540
What is it?

18:46.590 --> 18:50.310
Looks like the early drafts
of a tormented conscience.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.670
~ I need your help.
~ Of course.

18:52.720 --> 18:55.030
What do you need me to do?

18:55.080 --> 18:57.180
Father?

19:02.960 --> 19:05.660
I need to talk to Lieutenant Graham.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.720
I hope you know what you're
doing, Father.

19:20.610 --> 19:24.510
What Major Rawlings and I
talked about is private.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.830
All you need to know is that
I left him outside the mess

19:26.880 --> 19:28.070
and I did not kill him.

19:28.120 --> 19:31.470
Sir, you were seen using
physical force against him.

19:31.520 --> 19:36.710
If it was any concern of yours,
I would tell you, Lieutenant!

19:36.760 --> 19:39.950
Sir, what evidence we have
points to you.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.190
It would help if someone could
verify...

19:42.240 --> 19:45.150
Wait! I received a telephone call.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.510
Who from, sir?

19:46.560 --> 19:47.950
Fortescue at the War Office.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.790
Immediately after the call,
I came to the shooting range.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.110
KNOCK AT DOOR

19:52.160 --> 19:55.430
He telephoned me at my desk,
which proves I was there!

19:55.480 --> 19:58.190
Let me confirm this with Fortescue,
sir.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.840
~ Lieutenant Graham...
~ I'm busy.
~ But it's important.
~ Enough!

20:06.160 --> 20:07.760
Whisky, please.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.390
You've been questioned?

20:13.440 --> 20:15.750
Yes, Graham's checking my alibi.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.710
Then I can get on with my job.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.750
What did it do to you, Laurence?

20:20.800 --> 20:25.510
~ I'm sorry?
~ The war. Dunkirk.

20:25.560 --> 20:30.360
~ I thought you didn't
want an explanation.
~ I didn't. But now...

20:31.000 --> 20:32.600
Why didn't you come back?

20:34.160 --> 20:35.760
War changes men.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.350
We saw things
we didn't think we'd see,

20:40.400 --> 20:42.830
did things we didn't know
we had in us.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.080
Some of those things...
I'm not proud of.

20:49.120 --> 20:53.070
I can't talk here. My quarters?

20:53.120 --> 20:55.220
Ten minutes?

21:03.120 --> 21:05.220
No luck?

21:05.360 --> 21:06.960
Best get after him.

21:07.010 --> 21:08.710
Why?

21:08.760 --> 21:12.430
If it was him, he'd have to get rid
of any incriminating evidence.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.670
Unless, of course, you think it
was the Lieutenant?

21:14.720 --> 21:17.390
We can't rule out Mrs McCarthy
either, can we?

21:17.440 --> 21:20.940
You may mock, Inspector,
but you may be right.

21:20.990 --> 21:25.190
Even if he did kill Rawlings,
he didn't steal the sword.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.350
~ Then who did?
~ Well, I believe it's
that young waitress.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.910
Whoever stole the sword
cut their hand on the cabinet

21:31.960 --> 21:33.670
and she has a cut hand.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.390
But she's got an alibi.

21:35.440 --> 21:38.760
GUNSHOTS

21:41.200 --> 21:42.950
No, Father, no!

21:43.000 --> 21:44.310
GUNSHOT

21:44.360 --> 21:46.630
Father, run! Father, run!

21:46.680 --> 21:48.780
GUNSHOT

21:51.560 --> 21:53.660
Get down!

21:55.280 --> 21:56.880
He's finished.

21:59.670 --> 22:01.670
You could have been killed.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.950
If he wanted me dead, I would be.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.030
St Clare's certainly handy with
a rifle.

22:06.080 --> 22:09.710
Yes, that was pistol, not a rifle.

22:09.760 --> 22:12.830
Which makes our shooter an even
more exceptional shot.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.150
I want every handgun on the base
checked to make sure

22:15.200 --> 22:16.670
it hasn't been fired.

22:16.720 --> 22:20.070
Someone's tried to murder you, I
really need you to get off the base.

22:20.120 --> 22:23.190
And I need you to show me
Rawlings's watch.

22:23.240 --> 22:26.640
I warned you to keep out.
Put him in Cell 3.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.360
You going to do something?

22:31.400 --> 22:34.470
Lieutenant, as much as it pains me

22:34.520 --> 22:38.480
to say this, sometimes
the priest is right.

22:39.230 --> 22:43.830
You've been very helpful,
Mr Fortescue. Thank you very much.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.980
Goodbye.

22:47.210 --> 22:49.310
Sir.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.990
Now...

22:51.040 --> 22:53.040
This better be good.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.510
Was this exactly how you found it?

22:58.560 --> 23:02.390
Yes. Just so you know,
that telephone call was from
the War Office,

23:02.440 --> 23:07.830
confirming that they called
the Colonel at his desk at 12:43
precisely,

23:07.880 --> 23:10.950
leaving one person still
without an alibi.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.800
~ Really? ~ Really.
~ Me? ~ You.
~ Again. ~ Again.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.870
This isn't Major Rawlings' watch.

23:19.920 --> 23:23.830
Major Rawlings' watch
was in his room.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.550
How do you know it's in his room?

23:25.600 --> 23:27.030
The crown is extended.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.070
Which you only do to reset the time.

23:29.120 --> 23:32.030
The killer realised that
Major Rawlings had

23:32.080 --> 23:37.030
forgotten his watch, used their
watch, set the time to 12:43,

23:37.080 --> 23:38.680
and broke it...

23:39.170 --> 23:42.870
.. and put their watch
on Major Rawlings' wrist.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.550
Why on earth would they do that?

23:44.600 --> 23:50.500
Make us think the murder was at 12:43
and they've given themselves
an alibi.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.710
Am I right, Sid?

23:54.760 --> 23:57.660
So, the Colonel's alibi is
worthless.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.750
Here we are.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.900
Privacy.

24:06.210 --> 24:10.110
You've faced German guns.
Am I really so fearsome?

24:10.160 --> 24:11.760
You have no idea.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.680
I came back for you.

24:15.960 --> 24:20.470
June 1940. I... I came to
Kembleford.

24:20.520 --> 24:23.190
I was going to sweep you
off your feet.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.830
I saw you at the square.

24:25.880 --> 24:29.080
You were, of course, beautiful.

24:30.280 --> 24:32.680
You wore your blue floral dress.

24:34.200 --> 24:38.100
The day the Kembleford men
came back from Dunkirk.

24:39.240 --> 24:42.150
Seeing you there...

24:42.200 --> 24:44.400
You deserved
better than me.

24:54.290 --> 24:57.190
~ You still have it.
~ HE LAUGHS SLIGHTLY

24:57.240 --> 24:59.520
Of course I still have it.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.860
You had a disagreement with
Rawlings today.

25:10.320 --> 25:11.920
What was it about?

25:12.440 --> 25:14.940
Has someone sent you to ask that?

25:17.800 --> 25:19.900
Felicia?

25:31.080 --> 25:32.680
The scabbard...

25:34.400 --> 25:38.030
The key to the murder
lies in Dunkirk.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.310
At lunch, Rawlings said something
about

25:41.360 --> 25:44.480
wanting to go back to BEFORE
the charge.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.680
Are you all right?

25:55.960 --> 25:58.260
I'm sorry, Laurence. I had to.

25:58.310 --> 26:00.870
I can't be an accessory to murder.

26:00.920 --> 26:04.310
Felicia, you must believe that
I didn't kill him.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.960
I wish I could.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.320
Can we go now, please?

26:17.370 --> 26:21.350
Now that I've made an arrest,
you're no longer suspects.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.190
So, yes, you can go.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.940
Thank you for your patience, Father.

26:27.440 --> 26:30.040
There is some unfinished business.

26:31.200 --> 26:35.630
Well, Lieutenant and Sid.
The assault course.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.070
You're not actually suggesting
that goes ahead?

26:38.120 --> 26:39.630
It'd be good for morale.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.990
It'd send out the right message
to the men.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.710
And I want to collect my winnings.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.470
Are you both off your rocker?

26:45.520 --> 26:47.120
One moment, please.

26:54.010 --> 26:56.310
I think it's an excellent idea.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.150
You don't think the Colonel did it?

26:59.200 --> 27:01.230
He didn't kill Rawlings.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.270
Lieutenant Graham will be
off his guard.

27:03.320 --> 27:07.150
I want you to find out if he knows
what happened between St Clare

27:07.200 --> 27:11.000
and Rawlings at Dunkirk
before the charge.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.700
All right, but you owe me one.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.940
Well, can't blame you for trying
to wriggle out it.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.950
Go!

27:26.000 --> 27:28.100
ARMY OFFICERS: Come on, Sid!

27:34.370 --> 27:38.870
Are you putting on a brave face,
Regimental Sergeant Major?

27:38.920 --> 27:41.790
I would've died or spent
the rest of the war in a POW camp

27:41.840 --> 27:43.840
if it wasn't for the Colonel.

27:43.890 --> 27:47.190
I can't believe it
unless the evidence is overwhelming,

27:47.240 --> 27:49.550
but we still have a regiment to run.

27:49.600 --> 27:52.270
You said the sword was
stolen before 12:30?

27:52.320 --> 27:56.350
~ Yes.
~ But before 12:30, we were
in the mess with the Colonel.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.270
So, he couldn't have stolen
the sword.

27:59.320 --> 28:03.320
~ Maybe he had someone
steal it for him?
~ Possibly, but who?

28:03.370 --> 28:06.030
Something happened
before the charge at Dunkirk,

28:06.080 --> 28:10.520
something that haunted
Major Rawlings until he died.

28:13.760 --> 28:18.460
Is it possible Lieutenant Graham had
something to do with it?

28:19.200 --> 28:21.910
Could he have killed Major Rawlings?

28:21.960 --> 28:24.110
He was a corporal.
They were officers.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.990
If they were in cahoots,
I'd have seen it.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.670
It was a long time ago, though.

28:28.720 --> 28:32.030
I remember everything before
we attacked.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.470
'I remember Rawlings
pursuing Major Murray.'

28:35.520 --> 28:37.150
Davis. A message to HQ. Urgent.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.600
Sir, speak to the Colonel first!

28:43.120 --> 28:45.190
Just keep comms on standby.

28:45.240 --> 28:47.340
Yes, sir.

28:52.630 --> 28:54.230
What was the message?

28:54.280 --> 28:55.510
'I never found out.'

28:55.560 --> 28:58.510
There was a company of Engineers
on the other side of the forest,

28:58.560 --> 29:00.710
maybe the Colonel wanted them
to attack the enemy.

29:00.760 --> 29:04.260
The point is,
Lieutenant Graham wasn't there.

29:04.440 --> 29:09.110
So, no, I don't think
he killed Major Rawlings.

29:09.160 --> 29:12.480
SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT

29:29.040 --> 29:31.140
Thank you.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.860
Well done. The better man won.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.390
You could've won that.

29:57.440 --> 30:00.640
What happened with Rawlings
after the charge?

30:00.690 --> 30:03.070
The Father's trying to clear
the Colonel.

30:03.120 --> 30:07.110
~ Yeah, and I'm not going to warn him again.
~ He was right about the watch, wasn't he?

30:07.160 --> 30:10.860
Come on, do you want to help
the Colonel or not?

30:13.320 --> 30:17.820
The only time I saw them was
when I came up to get orders.

30:19.760 --> 30:24.060
'Rawlings was coming
out of the woods with the Colonel.'

30:24.770 --> 30:28.270
Men, the Germans have reinforcements
arriving,

30:28.320 --> 30:31.630
but the Engineers are on the other
side of the forest and will slow
them down.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.430
Our only chance is to attack
the bridge now.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.590
Sir, the men aren't ready.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.240
We attack now!

30:40.090 --> 30:43.990
Right, you've got your orders.
Let's get a move on.

30:44.040 --> 30:47.470
Get all your kit, canteens sitting
there. You all right, lads?

30:47.520 --> 30:49.120
OK... OK, sir?

30:49.990 --> 30:51.590
'That was all I saw.'

30:51.640 --> 30:53.670
Next thing I knew
he led the charge,

30:53.720 --> 30:56.020
we were fighting for our lives.

30:59.100 --> 31:03.600
All this place needs now is a quick
sweep and we're ready.

31:03.650 --> 31:08.270
Regimental Sergeant Major Davis said
three men went into the trees,

31:08.320 --> 31:11.590
Lieutenant Graham said two men
came out,

31:11.640 --> 31:15.840
which means Major Murray was
left behind in the woods.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.880
Where does a wise man hide a leaf?

31:19.450 --> 31:21.550
In a forest?

31:21.600 --> 31:23.600
What if there's no forest?

31:25.600 --> 31:27.200
You plant one.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.880
Father, 15 minutes.

31:32.000 --> 31:38.310
Either Major Rawlings or Colonel
St Clare planted a forest of bodies,

31:38.360 --> 31:43.190
by committing the Third to the attack
against the Germans before they were
ready.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.840
Why would you do that?

31:46.080 --> 31:48.380
To hide Major Murray's murder?

31:49.000 --> 31:52.070
Ohh, talk, talk, talk!

31:52.120 --> 31:55.230
Oh, I know I can rely on you.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.550
None of this proves that the Colonel
didn't steal the sword

31:58.600 --> 32:00.200
and didn't kill Rawlings.

32:00.570 --> 32:03.470
I think the waitress stole
the sword.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.630
Miss Murray?

32:04.680 --> 32:06.430
Miss who?

32:06.480 --> 32:08.580
Murray.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.380
Simone?

32:14.960 --> 32:16.560
Simone Murray.

32:18.440 --> 32:20.040
Major Murray's daughter?

32:20.790 --> 32:25.190
I'm so glad you decided to come here
today to honour him.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.310
You must be so proud.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.230
Yes, he was a hero.

32:30.280 --> 32:34.080
It must have been very hard,
losing him so young.

32:34.960 --> 32:38.960
He was a wonderful father.
I miss him every day.

32:39.330 --> 32:42.630
I never understood why you
stole the sword.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.150
Until I heard your name.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.070
Did you kill Major Rawlings?

32:46.120 --> 32:48.220
No!

32:48.890 --> 32:51.190
I don't think the Colonel did.

32:51.240 --> 32:56.280
And it would be terrible for such
a hero to be hanged.

32:57.530 --> 32:59.630
He's no hero.

32:59.680 --> 33:04.590
He's a traitor. My father was
the only one who stood up to him.

33:04.640 --> 33:07.230
The Colonel ordered you to get
these co-ordinates to HQ,

33:07.280 --> 33:09.990
requesting the Engineers launch
a diversionary attack.

33:10.040 --> 33:13.190
~ Yes, they've to mobilise in an hour.
~ He didn't tell you?
~ Tell me what?

33:13.240 --> 33:15.750
~ He's sending them to their deaths.
~ We don't know that.

33:15.800 --> 33:19.510
Liar! You had me recce
those co-ordinates this morning.

33:19.560 --> 33:22.710
There's a German Panzer
division waiting.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.710
If HQ know about those tanks,
they'll never send the Engineers.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.670
~ They'll be slaughtered!
~ This is war.

33:27.720 --> 33:31.070
Their sacrifice will help more men
get home to fight another day.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.190
Sacrifice?

33:33.240 --> 33:36.390
You don't even have the decency to
warn them and give them a fighting
chance.

33:36.440 --> 33:39.910
~ It's for the greater good.
~ No. You do nothing
for the greater good.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.510
If those tanks aren't delayed,

33:41.560 --> 33:44.070
we will all be killed. I will not
stand by and let that happen.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.190
Nah, you just want to save
your own neck.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.550
Prove me wrong.
Send HQ another message

33:49.600 --> 33:52.430
and tell them what awaits
the Engineers.

33:52.480 --> 33:56.190
I will not send those men to die
just to save us.

33:56.240 --> 33:59.120
You are a coward and a traitor.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.160
Are you going to stand for this?

34:04.280 --> 34:06.380
Oh, I see.

34:06.730 --> 34:11.230
Well then, let's see if HQ think it's
for the greater good.

34:11.280 --> 34:14.280
~ Stop!
~ It's not too late for them to...

34:22.600 --> 34:27.230
Sir, what are you going to do now?

34:27.280 --> 34:28.750
Bring forward the attack.

34:28.800 --> 34:32.150
But the men are dead on their feet!
We need to prepare for the final
surge.

34:32.199 --> 34:35.800
If we attack now,
no-one will notice he's dead.

34:36.080 --> 34:41.580
'His Engineers never made it back
to their families, to save his
neck.'

34:41.670 --> 34:45.469
My father was the only one who
tried to stop him.

34:45.520 --> 34:49.719
Major Rawlings' conscience finally
caught up with him.

34:50.840 --> 34:53.469
And he told you?

34:53.520 --> 34:57.150
No... He told your accomplice,

34:57.200 --> 34:58.870
who made a thief of you.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.520
I'm not a thief.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.480
How did you cut your hand?

35:06.480 --> 35:08.190
In the mess kitchen.

35:08.240 --> 35:11.070
And where were you
when the sword was stolen?

35:11.120 --> 35:13.160
I... I went for a walk.

35:13.970 --> 35:16.070
Left the others to clean up.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.350
Of course you did.

35:18.400 --> 35:21.270
Thank you, Miss Murray.

35:21.320 --> 35:25.470
Father, the Third will start
arriving any minute now.

35:25.520 --> 35:30.920
When they arrive, would you be so
kind as to send someone in to see me?

35:31.160 --> 35:33.260
Who?

35:35.330 --> 35:37.430
You asked to see me, Father?

35:37.480 --> 35:38.670
I owe you a pound.

35:38.720 --> 35:43.390
Ah. An honourable man always
pays his debts. One way or another.

35:43.440 --> 35:46.150
Please,
give it to the poor in the parish.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.390
Thank you.

35:47.440 --> 35:51.440
Oh, Regimental Sergeant Major,
do you have the time?

35:53.870 --> 35:57.070
I knew Simone Murray had
stolen the sword,

35:57.120 --> 35:58.710
but she had an impeccable alibi

35:58.760 --> 36:01.060
and I couldn't square the two.

36:02.230 --> 36:06.430
She said when the sword was stolen
she'd left the mess

36:06.480 --> 36:08.390
and gone for a walk.

36:08.440 --> 36:14.030
What she didn't know was that
you had already lied
that she was still in the mess.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.980
You killed Major Rawlings,
didn't you?

36:22.240 --> 36:24.470
He sent you a letter.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.550
Yes?

36:26.600 --> 36:30.550
He thought it best if the Colonel
confessed everything himself.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.590
A wise and decent man.

36:32.640 --> 36:34.870
When St Clare left Major Murray
fatally wounded,

36:34.920 --> 36:37.470
Rawlings at least
ended his suffering.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.390
But that's the only decency
he ever had.

36:39.440 --> 36:42.670
He was burdened
by Major Murray's death.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.510
Did you want to avenge that?

36:44.560 --> 36:46.660
No.

36:47.210 --> 36:51.910
St Clare gave us instructions to be
battle-ready in one hour.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.550
The men were still
getting their weapons ready

36:54.600 --> 36:57.230
when he brought forward the charge.

36:57.280 --> 37:01.070
Some of the rifles jammed
because of the rush.

37:01.120 --> 37:06.870
A lot of my men, good men, died to
hide his cowardice.

37:06.920 --> 37:10.310
Maybe that doesn't make you angry,
Father, but it does me.

37:10.360 --> 37:13.150
I served in two World Wars.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.510
Of course it makes me angry.

37:15.560 --> 37:17.750
Why not just let him
suffer the consequences?

37:17.800 --> 37:20.430
Rawlings told me
everything in the letter.

37:20.480 --> 37:24.590
If the Colonel didn't confess,
I was to take it to the army.

37:24.640 --> 37:28.030
But he underestimated me.
I'll never expose St Clare.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.350
Why?

37:29.400 --> 37:31.500
The shame.

37:31.680 --> 37:35.030
The shame would destroy
this regiment.

37:35.080 --> 37:40.390
I will not have the world know
that we were led by a traitor
and a coward.

37:40.440 --> 37:43.110
If he was a coward,
how did he lead you into battle?

37:43.160 --> 37:44.430
He didn't!

37:44.480 --> 37:47.470
As soon as we engaged the enemy,
he ducked behind us.

37:47.520 --> 37:51.510
Everyone else was busy trying not to
get killed but I saw him!

37:51.560 --> 37:56.510
And afterwards, when they called
St Clare "the great hero",

37:56.560 --> 37:58.230
well,

37:58.280 --> 38:03.470
like you said, Father,
the country needed heroes.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.750
I kept my mouth shut.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.830
So, you made Miss Murray steal
the sword for you,

38:08.880 --> 38:12.510
bring it to you, then you killed
Rawlings?

38:12.560 --> 38:14.390
Don't feel sympathy for him.

38:14.440 --> 38:18.120
You hid the scabbard
in the Colonel's quarters...

38:18.170 --> 38:21.470
.. so it'd look like he'd committed
the murder.

38:21.520 --> 38:26.270
Lady Felicia saved me the trouble of
giving Lieutenant Graham an
anonymous tip-off.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.470
But why shoot at me?
It was you, wasn't it?

38:28.520 --> 38:30.830
I saw you break into Rawlings'
quarters.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.990
I only wanted to scare you.

38:33.040 --> 38:36.550
Nothing can stop the Colonel
paying for what he did.

38:36.600 --> 38:40.910
He's lived with the glory,
now he knows the world despises him
as a murderer.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.350
Pity it's for the wrong murder.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.950
The regiment comes first.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.110
Tell the Colonel.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.990
Tell him everything.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.910
I killed Rawlings.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.430
I know you didn't.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.080
They'll hang you.

38:59.130 --> 39:03.230
Is it because the honour
of the regiment comes first?

39:03.280 --> 39:07.780
Or that you'd rather be
known as a murderer than a traitor?

39:11.860 --> 39:16.260
This regiment has been my life,
it's what I was born for.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.310
If the truth comes out now,

39:18.360 --> 39:20.350
how long do you think
I could live with the shame?

39:20.400 --> 39:23.150
How much longer can you live
with the lie?

39:23.200 --> 39:26.300
I've become very good
at living with it.

39:27.840 --> 39:32.750
I made one... terrible mistake

39:32.800 --> 39:36.500
and it has cost me more than you
will ever know.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.820
Will you hear my confession?

40:05.480 --> 40:10.080
Do you repent for what you did to
Major Murray and your men?

40:11.240 --> 40:13.240
Every day and every night.

40:21.900 --> 40:25.000
Confession must be sincere
and absolute.

40:25.050 --> 40:27.950
As long as you put your reputation
first,

40:28.000 --> 40:31.100
I fear God will not see
true repentance.

40:35.410 --> 40:37.510
I can't.

40:37.560 --> 40:42.710
Don't you think that Simone
deserves to hear, from you,

40:42.760 --> 40:44.860
what happened to her father?

40:44.910 --> 40:48.950
Don't you think the families
of the other men that died

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
deserve to know the truth?

41:02.640 --> 41:07.440
You can dress it up as justice or
revenge but murder is murder.

41:08.400 --> 41:11.350
~ You'll tell no-one?
~ Me?

41:11.400 --> 41:13.310
No.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.960
CHURCH BELL RINGS

41:44.150 --> 41:45.750
I told no-one.

41:45.800 --> 41:49.670
But I think
the Colonel told everything.

41:49.720 --> 41:52.070
Regimental Sergeant Major Davis,

41:52.120 --> 41:54.430
I'm arresting you on suspicion of
the murder

41:54.480 --> 41:56.430
of Major Rawlings.

41:56.480 --> 41:59.150
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

41:59.200 --> 42:05.100
but what you say will be
taken down in writing
and may be given in evidence.

42:15.070 --> 42:18.470
The sword was all that
mattered to St Clare.

42:18.520 --> 42:21.310
I thought stealing it would
hurt him.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.960
Will we see you at Mass on Sunday?

42:33.520 --> 42:36.430
Sinclair killed her father.

42:36.480 --> 42:40.980
And then rushed the Third into battle
to cover his murder.

42:41.960 --> 42:46.270
Poor girl. Her father
cut down by a traitor.

42:46.320 --> 42:48.420
She's right.

42:49.510 --> 42:53.110
Well, they will call him a coward
and a traitor

42:53.160 --> 42:56.310
but he has just made the bravest
decision of his life.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.910
If only he'd made it during the war.

42:58.960 --> 43:01.060
Indeed.

43:01.360 --> 43:06.320
But war does rather tend to show
a man what he really is.
