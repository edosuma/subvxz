00:09.567 --> 00:12.303
<i>Previously on</i>
Mayor of Kingstown <i>...</i>

00:12.303 --> 00:13.805
Milo broke something.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.807
He took it and he broke it.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.842
And that's why
we're not letting him leave.

00:17.842 --> 00:19.844
But you have to
let shit play out.

00:19.844 --> 00:21.712
Bunny, we're this fucking close.

00:21.712 --> 00:23.114
I'm gonna get you out of here.

00:23.114 --> 00:24.582
I can't bide my time, Mike.

00:24.582 --> 00:26.150
Just stay the course.

00:26.150 --> 00:29.120
The <i>only course I see
is the one I'm making.</i>

00:29.120 --> 00:30.588
What the fuck?

00:34.826 --> 00:37.095
<i>We had an inmate,
took him to the infirmary,</i>

00:37.095 --> 00:41.332
docs examining him, they're
gonna find a ton of trauma.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.767
<i>Just be plain, Carney.</i>

00:42.767 --> 00:45.636
- He's one of the three.
- Three what?

00:47.972 --> 00:50.641
Hey!
He wasn't fucking resisting CO!

00:50.641 --> 00:51.909
You with the ACLU, Carney?

00:51.909 --> 00:53.778
Get you some alone time, son.

00:53.778 --> 00:56.781
They put a beatdown on him, Mike
and drug his ass to solitary.

00:58.549 --> 01:00.751
I heard all about you.
White savior bullshit.

01:00.751 --> 01:02.286
You ain[t savin' shit.

01:02.286 --> 01:04.388
<i>What, you think if
Mike McLusky could fix this,</i>

01:04.388 --> 01:05.990
<i>he would have fixed it by now?</i>

01:24.436 --> 01:26.171
<i>They're farming out
inmate labor to companies</i>

01:26.171 --> 01:28.841
<i>all across the state.</i>

01:28.841 --> 01:33.445
<i>Know what they're paying?
$0.16 an hour.</i>

01:33.445 --> 01:36.482
<i>That's fucking free labor.</i>

01:36.482 --> 01:38.751
<i>They're spending more money
on food for guard dogs</i>

01:38.751 --> 01:40.853
<i>than they are for the inmates.</i>

01:40.853 --> 01:42.588
There's no way out for them.

01:42.588 --> 01:44.256
And you don't want there to be.

01:44.256 --> 01:46.558
You need that cycle,

01:46.558 --> 01:48.160
that's how you get paid.

01:48.160 --> 01:51.597
Is that why you came
all the way up here, Mike?

01:51.597 --> 01:55.000
To explain to me
how my company works?

01:55.000 --> 01:58.404
It's all been tried,
and this is where we've landed.

01:58.404 --> 02:00.339
So you can join in,

02:00.339 --> 02:05.277
or you can get crushed
by the wheels of progress.

02:05.277 --> 02:07.746
Yeah. Well...

02:08.213 --> 02:10.716
I need a favor.

02:10.716 --> 02:12.317
Is that so?

02:12.317 --> 02:13.952
Trying to get something done.

02:13.952 --> 02:17.156
I'm tired of the trees
that I'm barking up.

02:17.156 --> 02:19.525
So you and your
wheels of progress

02:19.525 --> 02:22.227
can help me
move something along.

02:22.227 --> 02:25.030
And what do I get?

02:25.030 --> 02:26.598
You get me.

02:26.598 --> 02:29.435
I'll owe you something.

02:31.437 --> 02:33.405
So I have a guy at Anchor Bay.

02:33.405 --> 02:35.007
And you want him
moved to Warwick?

02:35.007 --> 02:37.209
No. Fuck, no. I want him out.

02:37.209 --> 02:39.545
I have a deal
with the DA's office.

02:39.545 --> 02:41.914
He's got the paper on his desk.
Case needs a little shove.

02:41.914 --> 02:43.415
And reelection's
around the corner.

02:43.415 --> 02:46.452
Those fuckers need money.
Contracts are being gifted out,

02:46.452 --> 02:47.653
most of them
under your umbrella.

02:47.653 --> 02:49.088
I need someone
to get his attention,

02:49.088 --> 02:50.556
to put this paper
under his fucking nose

02:50.556 --> 02:53.692
and make him fuckin' sign it.

02:53.692 --> 02:54.927
If I could, I'd kick open
the fucking door

02:54.927 --> 02:57.262
and get done myself.

02:58.330 --> 03:00.232
Okay.

03:02.501 --> 03:03.736
Okay.

04:37.329 --> 04:39.965
So you telling me Bunny in the
hole ain't a fucking problem?

04:39.965 --> 04:42.401
Bunny'll be out by noon.

04:42.401 --> 04:46.205
Besides, even in that hole,
motherfucker still making moves.

04:47.573 --> 04:49.808
Still smell that crispy,
bitch-ass motherfucker

04:49.808 --> 04:50.876
in the air.

04:50.876 --> 04:53.579
That was AB sanctioning shit.

04:53.579 --> 04:55.881
They got the guards, bro.

04:55.881 --> 04:57.716
As long as you got the guards,
you got the yard.

04:57.716 --> 04:59.585
Yeah, well,
that balance about to shift.

04:59.585 --> 05:01.486
How you see that?

05:01.486 --> 05:03.922
I gotta earn, Raph.

05:03.922 --> 05:06.458
You gotta be slinging in
to be earning out.

05:06.458 --> 05:07.926
Know what I'm saying?

05:07.926 --> 05:09.995
When Bunny get out,
no matter if he gotta

05:09.995 --> 05:13.665
drop that cracker hisself,
shit's going down.

05:13.665 --> 05:16.368
We gettin' our shit back.

05:16.368 --> 05:17.769
I don't see it, bro.

05:17.769 --> 05:20.606
That's cause you got
one fucking eye.

05:27.012 --> 05:29.147
Man, I'm fucking with you, man.

05:30.582 --> 05:32.517
Play your card.

05:46.531 --> 05:48.000
Yo, Raph.

05:49.601 --> 05:51.837
Oh, it's on me, huh?

05:52.371 --> 05:54.106
I didn't know you motherfuckers
were so eager to lose.

05:54.106 --> 05:55.774
We ain't losing today.

05:55.774 --> 05:58.543
Shit, we'll see about that.

06:01.313 --> 06:03.382
Fuck you still doin'
with a diamond?

06:03.382 --> 06:04.483
Reneggin'-ass bitch.

06:04.483 --> 06:07.052
Yo, hold up, Hush.
Kid's still learnin'.

06:07.052 --> 06:08.820
Then why is he at
the fucking table, D?

06:08.820 --> 06:11.323
Y'all needed a fourth.

06:11.957 --> 06:15.894
You think Bun gonna
take out a pig or what?

06:22.167 --> 06:24.403
Shit's about to pop.

06:26.104 --> 06:27.639
No shit.
Motherfuckers owe us--

06:27.639 --> 06:29.408
Blade!

06:30.909 --> 06:32.110
Shit.

06:57.769 --> 07:00.105
Go!

07:33.271 --> 07:36.174
- Thank you, Rebecca.
- You're welcome.

07:36.174 --> 07:38.243
Hey, thanks for calling me back.

07:38.243 --> 07:40.178
He should be out
by the end of the day.

07:40.178 --> 07:41.613
<i>He should be?</i>

07:41.613 --> 07:43.115
Never should have been in AdSeg
in the first place,

07:43.115 --> 07:44.216
he's your inmate.

07:44.216 --> 07:45.384
<i>I don't run this prison,</i>

07:45.384 --> 07:47.819
I just oversee inmates
from Kingstown.

07:47.819 --> 07:49.287
<i>Just get him out,</i>

07:49.287 --> 07:50.889
all right, he can't run shit
from inside that box.

07:50.889 --> 07:52.324
Put him in general pop.

07:52.324 --> 07:54.693
There's a toasted Mexican
who I think would beg to differ.

07:54.693 --> 07:58.063
Well, that wasn't Bunny. Okay?
That was AB makin' a play.

07:58.063 --> 07:59.564
And you know it.

07:59.564 --> 08:01.533
Want to reduce the numbers
of browns or blacks.

08:01.533 --> 08:05.237
That's my point, Mike.
Anchor Bay is AB.

08:05.237 --> 08:08.340
Half them COs in here
are Aryan affiliated

08:08.340 --> 08:11.476
or sympathetic to the cause.

08:11.476 --> 08:15.447
<i>I'm only here for a few days
pushing paper, doing checks.</i>

08:15.447 --> 08:18.617
I can't do shit until I find out
who's pulling the strings here.

08:18.617 --> 08:21.286
Yeah, okay. Okay, great. Look,
I'm just gonna go in myself.

08:21.286 --> 08:23.121
How's that?
Can you give me visitors?

08:23.121 --> 08:25.924
<i>Can you do that, at least?</i>

08:25.924 --> 08:27.025
Yeah.

08:27.025 --> 08:29.027
Thank you.

08:29.961 --> 08:31.530
Fuck.

08:39.037 --> 08:40.605
What's going on?

08:40.605 --> 08:42.641
Hey babe!

08:45.043 --> 08:46.111
- Baby.
- Huh?

08:46.111 --> 08:48.213
Did your mom need a shed or...

08:48.213 --> 08:51.850
Uh, I don't know.
Probably. Right? I mean...

08:51.850 --> 08:55.253
I went to the store and I saw it
and I thought to myself,

08:55.253 --> 08:57.389
you know, that would be a good
place for her to put her

08:57.389 --> 09:00.725
gardening stuff and shit.
And so I built it,

09:00.725 --> 09:05.497
- and I got two more.
- Right.

09:28.214 --> 09:29.916
Did he say what it was about?

09:29.916 --> 09:32.285
Sounded like shit,
that's all I know.

09:32.285 --> 09:33.820
He said call you, call Kyle.

09:33.820 --> 09:34.921
Said come down here and meet.

09:34.921 --> 09:36.456
- That's all, that was it?.
- No, Ian.

09:36.456 --> 09:38.191
He told me the
fucking meaning of life,

09:38.191 --> 09:39.325
I just don't wanna
share it with you.

09:39.325 --> 09:41.628
Strange, that's all I'm saying.

09:41.628 --> 09:43.062
Hey, Donna.
What kinda pie you got?

09:43.062 --> 09:44.764
Banana cream and pecan.

09:44.764 --> 09:46.399
Like, in one pie?

09:46.399 --> 09:48.334
No, it's two pies.
It's two different kinds of pie.

09:48.334 --> 09:51.037
- Are they fresh?
- Meh...

09:51.037 --> 09:52.038
Donna, can I get a beer?

09:52.038 --> 09:53.106
Sure thing.

09:53.106 --> 09:54.240
Gimme a piece of pie, too.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.675
Which?

09:55.675 --> 09:57.543
I don't care. Surprise me.
Both of 'em, one each.

09:57.543 --> 10:01.147
Christ. Really?
Stop with the pie, he's here.

10:01.147 --> 10:02.815
- What's going on?
- Did you call Kyle?

10:02.815 --> 10:03.983
Yeah, He's on his way.

10:03.983 --> 10:05.985
Yeah, I'll wait.

10:05.985 --> 10:07.387
I can't, as much as I'd like to

10:07.387 --> 10:08.655
watch this clown eat pie all day.

10:08.655 --> 10:10.089
- Come on, you'll love it.
- Gotta get over to Anchor

10:10.089 --> 10:13.292
and wherever else.
What's going on?

10:15.361 --> 10:19.832
- I got a heart attack letter.
- Holy fuck.

10:19.832 --> 10:22.001
- When?
- This morning.

10:22.001 --> 10:23.169
DA said it's time to lawyer up,

10:23.169 --> 10:27.106
get my shit in order
and everything.

10:27.106 --> 10:29.942
- Shit.
- Hey.

10:29.942 --> 10:32.779
What's up?
What's the big deal?

10:35.114 --> 10:37.417
Heart attack letter.

10:37.417 --> 10:38.451
Oh, fuck.

10:38.451 --> 10:39.719
Yeah, they're coming for me.

10:39.719 --> 10:41.120
Yeah. You know who?

10:41.120 --> 10:42.355
DA, what do you think?

10:42.355 --> 10:44.857
No, I mean, who's rollin'?

10:44.857 --> 10:46.392
What do you mean?

10:46.392 --> 10:48.261
They ain't comin' after you
because of inmate testimony.

10:48.261 --> 10:51.164
Okay? Somebody rolled.

10:52.331 --> 10:53.533
You want something, hon?

10:53.533 --> 10:54.600
No.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.002
Just give us a second,
would ya, Donna?

10:56.002 --> 10:57.870
Thanks, Donna.
I appreciate it.

10:57.870 --> 10:59.338
We're all good.

11:01.374 --> 11:02.442
Who you thinking?

11:02.442 --> 11:03.676
We're a fucking family, Mike,

11:03.676 --> 11:06.079
nobody in there's
rolling on anybody.

11:06.079 --> 11:07.113
Somebody did.

11:07.113 --> 11:08.381
It was self-defense, Mike.

11:08.381 --> 11:10.283
I mean, there were hundreds
of them in there.

11:10.283 --> 11:11.951
You know, we would have
gotten torn apart.

11:11.951 --> 11:13.152
Self-defense.

11:13.152 --> 11:14.387
Bullshit, they should be suckin'
my dick,

11:14.387 --> 11:15.888
throwin' me a goddamn parade.

11:15.888 --> 11:18.925
We stopped that fucking thing
from the inside.

11:18.925 --> 11:21.561
Look, I hear you, I get it.
But they want a pound,

11:21.561 --> 11:23.362
and apparently wanna
take it from you.

11:23.362 --> 11:24.831
What about those
National Guard assholes?

11:24.831 --> 11:26.332
I mean, those fucking idiots
are playing video games

11:26.332 --> 11:28.334
up on those walls.

11:28.334 --> 11:30.870
Doesn't matter, Robert,
they have something.

11:30.870 --> 11:33.106
And if you say it's
not one of your guys,

11:33.106 --> 11:37.510
I gotta believe you, but I got
my money on one of these guys.

11:37.510 --> 11:41.013
Got a crisis of conscience or
sweet deal with the DA,

11:41.013 --> 11:42.582
something like that.

11:42.582 --> 11:45.284
I'll look around,
see what I can dig up.

11:45.284 --> 11:46.853
So what we do in the meantime?

11:48.221 --> 11:50.857
Get your story straight.

11:50.857 --> 11:52.825
Okay?

11:52.825 --> 11:54.527
Yeah.

11:54.527 --> 11:55.895
Doing anything after this?

11:55.895 --> 11:56.863
- Me?
- Yeah.

11:56.863 --> 11:58.464
- No, why?
- Got an errand.

11:58.464 --> 12:00.600
I can get you on the books.
Get you some baby scratch.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.068
Yeah, sure.

12:02.068 --> 12:03.736
We should talk
this shit through.

12:03.736 --> 12:04.604
Yeah. Yeah.

12:04.604 --> 12:05.905
What are you doing tonight?

12:05.905 --> 12:09.609
Tonight? Tonight.
Tracy's working tonight, so...

12:09.609 --> 12:11.944
- 9:00. I'm going to be there.
- Okay.

12:11.944 --> 12:13.412
You find this guy, all right?

12:13.412 --> 12:15.548
You find him, and we will
be fine, right Mike?

12:15.548 --> 12:18.084
Yeah. Yeah.
Just find out who's talking,

12:18.084 --> 12:20.386
and then we'll take the next
steps to take care of it, okay?

12:20.386 --> 12:22.488
- Yeah.
- Don't worry about it.

12:22.488 --> 12:24.490
In the meantime, just don't say
anything to anybody

12:24.490 --> 12:26.225
about this shit, okay?

12:26.225 --> 12:27.994
Keep your chin up.
We're all good.

12:27.994 --> 12:29.695
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- 100 percent.

12:31.531 --> 12:34.300
- This is fucked up, right?
- Yeah, it's fucked up.

12:34.534 --> 12:37.303
Hey, hold on.
Give me a second, huh?

12:45.611 --> 12:47.580
Hey, Rebecca, I need an address.

12:47.580 --> 12:51.117
Okay? All I got is
the last name, Davidson,

12:51.117 --> 12:54.287
He's a guard over at Anchor Bay.

12:54.287 --> 12:56.923
All right, well just--just text
it to me when you get it, okay?

12:56.923 --> 12:58.424
Bye, thank you.

12:58.424 --> 12:59.826
The fuck is that?

12:59.826 --> 13:02.495
There's too much talk about it.
I grabbed 'em.

13:02.495 --> 13:05.731
Fucking Jerry in the lockup.
He gave me 5 minutes,

13:05.731 --> 13:09.302
got him tickets to
the Molly Hatchet concert.

13:10.570 --> 13:13.773
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.

13:24.116 --> 13:26.452
Christ.

13:39.665 --> 13:41.167
Fucking heart attack letter, huh?

13:41.167 --> 13:44.370
- Yeah.
- Geez.

13:44.370 --> 13:47.139
Your DA friend didn't wanna
tell you?

13:47.139 --> 13:48.875
People say a lot of things, Kyle.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.344
It's hard to tell
when they mean it.

13:51.344 --> 13:52.678
Yeah.

13:53.946 --> 13:57.483
You can't be going off
and doing shit. Okay?

13:57.483 --> 13:59.552
What?
What do you mean?

13:59.552 --> 14:02.922
I mean the fucking bonds.
The fuck you think I mean?

14:02.922 --> 14:06.092
You can't go walking in
to fucking lockup.

14:06.092 --> 14:09.528
without tellin' me or Stevie
or somebody, all right?

14:09.528 --> 14:11.731
- They got cameras in there.
- Mike! I was KPD.

14:11.731 --> 14:13.900
I know where everything is
in there. I wiped the drives.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.001
Don't worry, we're good.

14:15.001 --> 14:17.637
And you don't think
it looks suspicious?

14:17.637 --> 14:19.805
Who gives a fuck
if it looks suspicious?

14:19.805 --> 14:22.108
As long as it doesn't
come back on us. Right?

14:22.108 --> 14:24.510
Just stay inside the lines,
that's all I'm askin'.

14:24.510 --> 14:26.646
Stay inside lines,
just a little bit. All right?

14:26.646 --> 14:29.448
Let the world settle down.
You settle down.

14:29.448 --> 14:33.986
No more Rambo shit.
Jesus, you got a lot going on.

14:36.255 --> 14:37.556
Yeah...

14:43.763 --> 14:47.800
Do you think I'm going to be
a good dad?

14:47.800 --> 14:52.104
What do you mean?
Yeah, of course.

14:53.139 --> 14:55.207
I mean, bringing
the kid into this world,

14:55.207 --> 14:56.475
raising them in this town?

14:56.475 --> 14:59.679
Yeah, that's fucked up.

15:00.379 --> 15:02.715
At least you're not.

15:04.850 --> 15:07.687
You're gonna be fucking great.

15:15.594 --> 15:17.296
What are we doing?

15:17.296 --> 15:18.931
Gotta make a stop.

15:18.931 --> 15:20.800
Huh?

15:22.902 --> 15:24.603
Aw, Jesus.

15:24.603 --> 15:27.707
If I'm not back in 5 minutes.
All right?

15:30.142 --> 15:31.777
Five minutes.

15:32.378 --> 15:33.946
The fuck?

15:44.590 --> 15:46.025
Hey, you Davidson?

15:46.025 --> 15:48.094
Depends. You sellin' something,
or servin' me papers?

15:48.094 --> 15:51.497
Naw, Mike McLusky.

15:51.731 --> 15:53.499
Talk to you for a minute?

15:53.499 --> 15:55.267
Ah, fucking A.

15:55.267 --> 15:56.902
Yeah, brother. Come on in.

15:56.902 --> 15:59.205
Yeah, I mean,
the place is kind of a mess.

16:03.876 --> 16:06.212
Get this out of your way here.

16:08.314 --> 16:10.116
Get you a beer or something?

16:10.116 --> 16:12.251
Nah, I'm good.

16:20.092 --> 16:21.794
Have a seat, brother.

16:21.794 --> 16:24.663
Nah, I'm good.
Just be here for a minute.

16:24.663 --> 16:27.466
So look, I hear, um,

16:27.466 --> 16:29.902
you're the big shit
over at Anchor.

16:29.902 --> 16:32.938
Some say.

16:32.938 --> 16:38.144
Okay, I need you back off
Bunny Washington.

16:39.378 --> 16:41.747
I can't do that, Mike.

16:41.747 --> 16:45.551
I wasn't really asking.

16:48.154 --> 16:50.556
Are you threatening me?

16:50.556 --> 16:53.492
It's just a delicate balance
going on over there.

16:53.492 --> 16:57.730
And you pushing the scale to AB

16:57.730 --> 17:00.800
is not really helping me here.

17:06.439 --> 17:08.474
You know,

17:08.474 --> 17:10.910
we had our own balance in there.

17:10.910 --> 17:13.045
Yeah.

17:19.685 --> 17:22.688
The fuck are we doing?

17:22.688 --> 17:25.691
What's it look like, Mike?

17:26.692 --> 17:29.128
I'm not here to fight you.

17:29.128 --> 17:30.796
I came here as a courtesy,

17:30.796 --> 17:32.832
tell you that this
is going to happen

17:32.832 --> 17:36.402
with or without
your cooperation.

17:36.402 --> 17:39.405
So...

17:39.405 --> 17:42.475
Get the fuck
out of my house.

17:42.475 --> 17:44.443
Fuck.

17:44.743 --> 17:46.245
- Hey, back up!
- What the fuck? All right!

17:46.245 --> 17:47.379
- Relax!
- Back the fuck up!

17:47.379 --> 17:49.882
Relax, Kyle...

17:50.282 --> 17:52.585
Think you can lay a hand
on my brother, motherfucker?

17:52.585 --> 17:55.488
I will paint the walls
with your goddamn brains.

17:55.488 --> 17:59.158
Look, dickhead, just do
what I fucking say, all right?

17:59.158 --> 18:01.627
And don't do fucking anything,
all right?

18:01.627 --> 18:05.898
Don't fuck with Bunny.
It's not that fucking hard.

18:05.898 --> 18:07.766
You know, you're gettin'
something on the side,

18:07.766 --> 18:11.003
maybe get a little bit less.

18:11.537 --> 18:12.838
- Hey. Hey, hey.
- All right!

18:12.838 --> 18:15.040
You fuck around.
I'm going to come back here.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.076
And I'm gonna ruin your world.
You understand?

18:17.076 --> 18:20.846
Bunny wakes up in gen pop, period.

18:20.846 --> 18:22.615
Don't fuck with Bunny.

18:22.615 --> 18:24.750
Let's go.

18:25.050 --> 18:26.819
Thought you were one of us, Mike.

18:26.819 --> 18:28.754
You thought fucking wrong.

18:29.054 --> 18:32.024
- Let's go.
- Hey, look at me.

18:32.024 --> 18:34.727
Look at me,
just do what he says.

18:35.561 --> 18:38.063
Fuck it Kyle.

18:38.063 --> 18:40.065
Let's go.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.968
What the fuck did I tell you?
What are you doing?

18:42.968 --> 18:44.136
I was looking through
the window.

18:44.136 --> 18:44.904
The fucking window?

18:44.904 --> 18:46.138
Yeah, you said 5 minutes.

18:46.138 --> 18:47.606
That wasn't fucking 5 minutes, motherfucker.

18:47.606 --> 18:48.774
Well, it felt like 5 minutes.

18:48.774 --> 18:52.311
Well, it's fucking wasn't.

18:53.445 --> 18:55.748
Pistol whippin' motherfuckers.

19:00.252 --> 19:02.388
- Buy you a fucking watch!
- It felt like 5 minutes.

19:58.752 --> 20:00.120
Ma?

20:00.120 --> 20:03.891
<i>Yeah, we're in here!</i>

20:05.993 --> 20:09.596
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh.

20:09.596 --> 20:13.767
I forgot.

20:13.767 --> 20:18.105
You know, um...
Sorry for keeping you up.

20:19.273 --> 20:22.042
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

20:22.042 --> 20:24.077
I thought we were talking.

20:24.077 --> 20:27.047
In the kitchen.
I won't keep him a minute.

20:27.047 --> 20:29.149
Take your time.
Take your time.

20:31.885 --> 20:34.354
- Everything's fine, Mom.
- Yeah. Okay. All right.

20:34.354 --> 20:37.591
And did you work
with Michael today?

20:37.591 --> 20:38.759
Yeah. Yeah.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.327
How was that?

20:40.327 --> 20:43.163
It was good. Good.
Yeah, everything's good.

20:43.163 --> 20:47.234
Just trying to figure out
this KPD thing with Ian, Right?

20:47.234 --> 20:51.405
So I just, you know.
But everything's good. Yeah.

20:51.405 --> 20:52.673
You good?

20:52.673 --> 20:55.843
Me? Yeah, well...

20:56.543 --> 20:59.313
Yeah.
Thanks.

21:00.447 --> 21:02.950
- Is that it? 'Cause I just--
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

21:02.950 --> 21:04.918
Go, go honey. Go.

21:04.918 --> 21:05.953
No, everything's fine.

21:05.953 --> 21:09.089
- Okay, thanks.
- Goodnight.

21:43.757 --> 21:46.193
It's about motherfuckin' time.

21:55.469 --> 21:58.138
I'ma own this prison by the time
I'm done with you motherfuckers.

21:58.138 --> 22:01.675
Well, that shackle shuffle says
something else to me, but

22:01.675 --> 22:02.876
keep hope alive, Bun.

22:02.876 --> 22:04.111
It ain't about hope no more, Carney.

22:04.111 --> 22:05.279
That's the difference between

22:05.279 --> 22:07.514
taking control
and taking charge.

22:07.514 --> 22:10.117
And I know I ain't in control
of this shit no more.

22:10.117 --> 22:13.387
But I sure as fuck will
take charge up in this bitch.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.720
All right, thanks.

22:50.824 --> 22:53.060
Bunny.

22:55.696 --> 22:57.097
Makin' the move today.

22:57.097 --> 22:59.132
Mitch'd already made that move.

22:59.132 --> 23:01.702
Yeah, well, I'm not Mitch.

23:01.702 --> 23:05.072
No, you ain't.

23:07.174 --> 23:11.678
There's been, um, no drive-bys
the last few days.

23:11.678 --> 23:16.917
No mass murders,
no innocent people being killed.

23:16.917 --> 23:20.053
Something must be going right.

23:20.053 --> 23:21.621
Answer me this.

23:21.621 --> 23:24.391
How many times
I'm supposed to let you fuck me?

23:24.391 --> 23:26.226
I told you to keep it quiet
inside here.

23:26.226 --> 23:27.928
What the fuck did you do?

23:27.928 --> 23:30.163
You torched the fucking
Mexican gatekeeper.

23:30.163 --> 23:32.032
That's not exactly
keepin' it quiet, is it?

23:32.032 --> 23:34.134
Quiet ain't a thing in here, Mike.

23:34.134 --> 23:36.570
Quiet maybe keep you clean
for a minute,

23:36.570 --> 23:38.205
but sooner or later, some mottherfucker

23:38.205 --> 23:39.940
gonna hit you with a question.
So you better be ready

23:39.940 --> 23:43.110
with a loud-ass motherfucking
answer, Mike!

23:43.110 --> 23:45.612
You ain't doing for me.
So I gotta raise my voice now.

23:45.612 --> 23:49.983
I have a new angle. Okay?
And I'm hitting on all sides.

23:49.983 --> 23:53.153
So you're good in here.
You understand?

23:53.153 --> 23:55.889
You're gonna be out in minutes,
I'm telling you.

23:55.889 --> 23:57.657
Look, Mike,
I'm tired of being told.

23:57.657 --> 24:00.360
All right?

24:00.360 --> 24:03.797
I'm tired of being the
dog dragged by the wagon.

24:03.797 --> 24:06.166
I ain't layin' down and gettin'
dragged along no more.

24:06.166 --> 24:08.435
No, I'm taking this shit
into my own hands now.

24:08.435 --> 24:13.040
- Come on, please.
- No more please, man.

24:14.341 --> 24:16.410
There was a mark on you.
You know that?

24:17.611 --> 24:21.448
I move that shit, I moved that
shit outta history with you.

24:21.448 --> 24:25.619
You moved it?
Bunny, to who?

24:27.854 --> 24:29.256
Where the fuck did you move it?

24:29.256 --> 24:30.490
Don't worry about it, Mike.

24:30.490 --> 24:32.392
You just keep
pulling your strings.

24:32.392 --> 24:35.028
Get me out of here.
I'll try to clear the way.

24:35.028 --> 24:39.132
Help me help you, brother Mike.

24:39.132 --> 24:41.735
Who's wearing it, Bunny?

24:41.735 --> 24:44.237
That's need to know shit.

24:44.237 --> 24:47.074
Yo ass don't need to.

24:47.074 --> 24:49.709
Whatever it is you're doing,
don't.

24:49.709 --> 24:51.678
You hear me?

25:09.357 --> 25:12.293
Thank you.

25:13.061 --> 25:15.463
The rest are in the yard.

25:16.598 --> 25:21.836
- Um, Sir. Can you uncuff him?
- No, ma'am.

25:21.836 --> 25:24.305
I'm guessing you're required
to stay in the room.

25:24.305 --> 25:26.975
Yes, ma'am.
Unless you're his attorney,

25:26.975 --> 25:28.409
in which case
you have the privilege.

25:28.409 --> 25:32.447
Oh, no. Well, I'm not.
So, thanks.

25:34.282 --> 25:36.551
Hello, Jacob.

25:36.551 --> 25:38.987
Hello.

25:38.987 --> 25:41.289
You wanted to talk to me?

25:47.862 --> 25:49.530
I've been...

25:50.765 --> 25:56.638
I've been having a pretty crappy
time right here.

25:58.906 --> 26:04.712
Uh, I'm 18 now.
My lawyer, he got me a deal.

26:05.913 --> 26:10.752
I just--I just have to go a year
without incident.

26:11.919 --> 26:14.455
But if I mess up or anything,

26:14.455 --> 26:19.293
my--my sentence goes
eight and state.

26:19.293 --> 26:22.463
Oh, man,
you don't want to mess up.

26:22.463 --> 26:24.532
Yeah.

26:25.566 --> 26:29.137
Uh, the Woods
came to me last week.

26:29.137 --> 26:31.606
- The Woods?
- The white boys.

26:31.606 --> 26:36.310
If I don't join up with them,
I'm--I'm going to be all alone.

26:36.310 --> 26:37.845
And if I'm all alone,
I won't have a chance

26:37.845 --> 26:39.047
of making it a year.

26:39.047 --> 26:41.416
I don't think I--
I understand...

26:41.416 --> 26:45.453
I know--I know who your son is.

26:45.453 --> 26:48.156
And Mike McLusky.
That's your son, right?

26:48.156 --> 26:49.624
Yeah, mm-hmm.

26:49.624 --> 26:53.828
He was inside, right?
He was with the Brotherhood.

26:53.828 --> 26:56.531
Wasn't he?

26:58.533 --> 27:02.804
Well, I mean, I guess he did
everything he had to do

27:02.804 --> 27:05.073
- to survive.
- Right.

27:05.073 --> 27:08.009
I thought that, you know,

27:08.009 --> 27:12.814
I'm gonna--I'm gonna mess
this up if I can't stay away

27:12.814 --> 27:16.884
from these people and all.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.722
I thought that maybe,

27:21.723 --> 27:26.427
maybe you could,
you could speak to your son.

27:27.462 --> 27:33.034
Or, maybe he can,
he could help me. You know, he--

27:33.034 --> 27:35.603
he could help me with them.

27:35.603 --> 27:39.407
Or he could help me get moved.

27:41.075 --> 27:44.145
I just don't--

27:44.145 --> 27:48.616
I just hope that maybe you could
speak to your son for me.

27:49.817 --> 27:52.787
I will.

27:52.787 --> 27:54.722
I will speak to him.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.850
Hey, hey.
How you doing? Mike McLusky.

28:22.850 --> 28:23.985
Nice to meet you, Mike.

28:23.985 --> 28:25.520
Mike? How'd you find me?

28:25.520 --> 28:27.755
Rebecca and your assistant
are, you know, tight.

28:27.755 --> 28:30.792
Yeah, I just want to take a
minute of your time to, um,

28:30.792 --> 28:33.161
- talk about our arrangement.
- Yeah. Not now, Mike.

28:33.161 --> 28:34.762
What arrangement is that?

28:34.762 --> 28:36.297
Well, you did a deal
with people I know.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.466
We got you peace in the streets.

28:38.466 --> 28:40.501
Got you peacocking
in front of the press.

28:41.736 --> 28:44.071
So I think it's about time
you held up your end of the deal

28:44.071 --> 28:47.108
and sign them the fuck out.

28:47.108 --> 28:49.310
You think that. Huh?

28:49.310 --> 28:52.146
Fuck yeah I do.

28:52.146 --> 28:54.315
Talked to my friend
over at Warwick.

28:54.315 --> 28:56.851
I understand that there's a
major negotiation

28:56.851 --> 28:59.487
within the city happening,
and with a reelection coming up,

28:59.487 --> 29:00.888
- Mike...
- What?

29:00.888 --> 29:03.658
- Please.
- First of all, your friends

29:03.658 --> 29:06.460
at Warwick have a lot more to
lose by crossing me

29:06.460 --> 29:08.796
than they have to gain
by supporting you.

29:08.796 --> 29:11.566
And second of all, these people
you're advocating for

29:11.566 --> 29:13.801
are dangerous criminals.

29:13.801 --> 29:16.237
They were arrested because they
present a menace to society.

29:16.237 --> 29:17.738
Now, why would I release them?

29:17.738 --> 29:19.707
Because you made a fucking deal
with them. That's why.

29:19.707 --> 29:23.411
Deals are made and broken all
the time, Mr. McLusky.

29:23.411 --> 29:25.913
Hand shakes, verbal, paper.
None of it matters.

29:25.913 --> 29:29.650
It fucking matters.
Matters to them.

29:29.650 --> 29:31.953
Deal's all they got,
word is bond.

29:31.953 --> 29:34.322
Interesting.
Whatever happened to, uh,

29:34.322 --> 29:37.625
no honor among thieves, huh?

29:38.593 --> 29:40.895
You tell him
about Milo Sunter?

29:43.664 --> 29:45.132
Milo Sunter's dead.

29:45.132 --> 29:46.534
Yeah. Maybe.

29:46.534 --> 29:49.437
Or more likely just walking
around the streets

29:49.437 --> 29:51.806
of your fucking city
with no DNA

29:51.806 --> 29:53.741
or anything on the records
of the dead.

29:53.741 --> 29:55.943
Now, if you hold up to your
fucking end of the deal,

29:55.943 --> 30:00.381
I can give you something
to bait the hook.

30:00.381 --> 30:01.716
Can flush him out.

30:01.716 --> 30:02.917
Or I'll just go to
the fucking press

30:02.917 --> 30:04.585
and tell 'em
you knew Milo escaped

30:04.585 --> 30:07.722
- and did fuck all about it.
- That's DOC. It's not on me.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.557
Do you think your voters
know the difference?

30:09.557 --> 30:11.259
You're the face.

30:11.259 --> 30:14.161
- I didn't know.
- You didn't?

30:14.161 --> 30:16.597
Assistant DA knew.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.535
No one's gonna believe
that you didn't.

30:21.769 --> 30:24.238
All right, let's get it done.

30:24.238 --> 30:26.574
Good to see you, Evelyn.

30:43.791 --> 30:47.261
You got a second?

30:47.261 --> 30:49.530
What's up?

30:51.299 --> 30:53.034
What's this?

30:53.034 --> 30:55.002
I need your signature.

31:00.241 --> 31:03.911
Our friend from Tent City died.

31:03.911 --> 31:05.146
What?

31:05.146 --> 31:08.883
Today. This morning.

31:16.157 --> 31:19.694
You think we can

31:19.694 --> 31:23.030
just sweep this under the rug?

31:24.966 --> 31:27.301
It's backdated.

31:27.301 --> 31:28.970
Our asses are covered.

31:28.970 --> 31:32.840
Inmates were involved
in a mutual combat.

31:32.840 --> 31:38.012
He was found unresponsive
and tended to immediately.

31:38.012 --> 31:43.351
Usual story.
No one saw anything.

31:43.351 --> 31:45.653
He sure ain't fucking talking.

31:48.022 --> 31:50.224
They will see
his infirmary records.

31:50.224 --> 31:55.229
Did he have follow-up care?

31:58.165 --> 32:02.536
Didn't want to complain
about the pain.

32:02.536 --> 32:05.973
Didn't want to be seen
as a pussy.

32:11.479 --> 32:13.814
Leave it here.

32:36.285 --> 32:37.787
Shit is brutal.

32:37.787 --> 32:40.189
I heard they got motherfuckers
digging graves or some shit.

32:40.189 --> 32:43.092
Fucking slave labor.
That's what this shit is.

32:43.092 --> 32:44.527
This big business.

32:44.527 --> 32:46.062
That's what this shit is.

32:47.363 --> 32:49.432
Shit gettin' done
on the outside?

32:49.432 --> 32:52.101
That's what they say, cuzzo.

32:58.741 --> 33:00.243
Fuck this hayseed doing?

33:09.785 --> 33:11.554
No bad intentions, brother.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.823
I ain't your brother.

33:14.790 --> 33:17.660
Well, spit it.
The fuck you want?

33:19.161 --> 33:22.632
That bitch jumped at you
wasn't sanctioned.

33:23.199 --> 33:26.202
Guy was a lone wolf and earned
himself a green light.

33:31.607 --> 33:34.243
Wasn't just you on that pier.

33:34.243 --> 33:38.381
If you're makin' moves to speed
things up, we got resources.

33:38.381 --> 33:40.616
I'm just saying.

33:43.252 --> 33:45.688
Hey CO!

33:46.956 --> 33:49.659
This pallet jack is fucked.

33:57.466 --> 33:59.201
Look at this shit...

33:59.902 --> 34:02.004
Fucking peckerwoods
bein' so friendly for?

34:02.004 --> 34:03.272
I don't know.

34:03.272 --> 34:05.374
I know we gotta
get the fuck up outta here.

34:12.181 --> 34:13.683
Fuck.

34:22.325 --> 34:23.759
Bitch ass.

34:32.468 --> 34:35.137
Oh, fuck no!

34:54.090 --> 34:55.558
What's up?

34:55.558 --> 34:57.860
Just checking in.
We doin' good?

34:57.860 --> 35:01.163
- All good, G.
- Yeah. What about the salon?

35:01.163 --> 35:03.633
Nobody even whispering
around this way no more.

35:03.633 --> 35:05.635
Shit's feeling like shit again.

35:05.635 --> 35:07.937
Come on.

35:25.321 --> 35:27.089
That's quiet.

35:27.089 --> 35:28.290
Yeah.

35:28.290 --> 35:33.162
Castle's intact.
Just needs its king back.

35:42.338 --> 35:43.706
Yeah, it's Mike.

35:43.706 --> 35:44.707
<i>This is a collect
call from...</i>

35:44.707 --> 35:46.275
<i>Bunny Washington.</i>

35:46.275 --> 35:47.910
<i>At the Anchor Bay
Correctional facility.</i>

35:47.910 --> 35:50.479
<i>To accept the charge of $2.40
for 15 minutes, press 1,</i>

35:50.479 --> 35:53.849
<i>to refuse press--
You may begin your call now.</i>

35:53.849 --> 35:56.686
- Hey, Bunny.
- I ain't got long. Aight?

35:56.686 --> 35:57.887
I just want to let you know

35:57.887 --> 35:58.988
that the path's
been cleared and shit.

35:58.988 --> 36:02.258
Okay? Time for you
to do your thing.

36:02.258 --> 36:04.493
What thing?

36:04.493 --> 36:07.463
Your mayor thing, man.
Get me outta this place, Mike.

36:10.099 --> 36:12.902
What path's been cleared, Bunny?

36:20.176 --> 36:22.044
<i>I did my shit,
now it's your turn.</i>

36:34.824 --> 36:36.392
Get that bitch of yours
to sign the papers

36:36.392 --> 36:38.694
and send my black ass home.

36:38.694 --> 36:40.830
Catch you later, Mayor Mike.
