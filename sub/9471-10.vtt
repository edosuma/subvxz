the sewer a little bit

11:40.664 --> 11:41.997

14:11.164 --> 14:12.372
Maybe for birthdays

14:12.373 --> 14:13.747
or, like, nephews graduating
or something.

14:13.748 --> 14:15.247
- But, like, this is where I want to be.
- Yeah.

14:15.248 --> 14:17.288
- Up here.
- Exactly. The older I get...

one of these, by the way?
