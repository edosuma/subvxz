00:25.315 --> 00:29.685
Hi David, this is Charlie. I call to you
a happy birthday wish

00:29.693 --> 00:31.715
Sorry to those tickets
could not give.

00:31.720 --> 00:35.325
I know you counted on me,
but my brother said ...

00:35.331 --> 00:38.260
Call you next week.
We can also agree.

00:38.265 --> 00:40.155
Have a good birthday.

00:40.161 --> 00:42.272
You can reach me on my cell ...

01:35.052 --> 01:37.648
You think you know all about pain?

01:38.091 --> 01:40.389
Talk again with my second wife.

01:41.311 --> 01:45.535
When she was 19, she became
between two fighting cats.

01:45.540 --> 01:49.265
One attacked her, climbed on her,
like a tree.

01:49.305 --> 01:54.650
Comments left on her thighs, breasts
and belly, you can still see.

01:54.697 --> 01:59.305
There were 30 stitches needed.
She had high fever for days.

02:00.387 --> 02:03.341
That is real pain, says my second wife.

02:14.423 --> 02:18.240
If I replace the man
under the car could reach ...

02:18.245 --> 02:19.844
I would have done that.

02:21.591 --> 02:25.900
But also can feel his pain,
might have mitigated the mine.

02:27.637 --> 02:29.491
It was the fiftieth.

02:30.566 --> 02:34.385
A period of foreign
suppressions and secrets.

02:34.389 --> 02:37.675
A period in which even the guilty
showed a rare innocence.

02:39.592 --> 02:41.356
Remembering what happened.

02:42.164 --> 02:44.092
Remembering what we had done.

02:46.884 --> 02:49.427
I am now on the wrong side
of the fifty.

02:50.674 --> 02:52.870
I earn $ 300,000 per year
Wall Street ...

02:52.880 --> 02:54.552
twice married, no children ...

02:54.556 --> 02:57.754
a house in the countryside,
a flat of the firm in the city

02:58.688 --> 03:02.015
My current wife knows nothing af
of what happened many years ago.

03:02.019 --> 03:04.352
I do not know whether I had ever
will tell.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.921
Why should I?

03:18.325 --> 03:23.012
Nothing in my life was still good
Since the summer of 1958.

03:24.445 --> 03:30.215
When Ruth, Donnie, Willie, and we all
met with Meg Loughlin ...

03:30.219 --> 03:32.853
and her sister Susan.

04:04.558 --> 04:06.627
What are you looking for?

04:09.147 --> 04:11.738
Crayfish.
- Can I look?

04:12.123 --> 04:15.131
I'm Meg.
- I'm David.

04:18.079 --> 04:19.957
What they are beautiful.

04:21.137 --> 04:24.000
I catch them, look for some
and let them go.

04:24.008 --> 04:25.458
Bite?

04:25.944 --> 04:28.895
Sometimes.
Usually they try to run away.

04:37.204 --> 04:39.709
Have you ever seen a crayfish?

04:39.892 --> 04:44.368
There are none in New York.
Well lobsters. They can hurt you.

04:44.727 --> 04:46.914
Can you as a pet?

04:47.177 --> 04:49.102
They are there to eat.

04:49.142 --> 04:51.205
Crayfish are also eaten.

04:51.210 --> 04:53.805
In Louisiana and Florida and such.

04:53.806 --> 04:56.146
So much to eat is not.

04:56.728 --> 04:58.625
We will try some large
to catch.

04:58.633 --> 05:01.024
Can I try it?
- Yeah.

05:05.265 --> 05:06.706
What is that?

05:07.431 --> 05:11.283
We have had an accident.

05:13.349 --> 05:16.895
Do you have more scars?

05:16.896 --> 05:19.734
A few, but this is the worst.

05:34.106 --> 05:36.745
I have one.
A big one.

05:40.192 --> 05:41.809
In my first attempt.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.025
Good catch.
Did you know that they sometimes kill each other?

05:46.030 --> 05:48.976
You could she recover?
- I always do.

05:50.916 --> 05:52.655
I must go back.

05:54.112 --> 05:56.131
But I wanted to look around.

05:56.775 --> 05:58.610
We had never
talked.

05:58.614 --> 06:01.047
Thanks, David, it was fun.

06:01.957 --> 06:03.320
Where you going now?

06:03.428 --> 06:05.865
We stay with our family,
the Chandlers.

06:05.870 --> 06:09.552
The Chandlers? We are their neighbors.
- Goodbye, David.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.685
BASED ON TRUE FACTS.

06:29.687 --> 06:35.478
Yet one days longer with your sister
and you could call the mad house.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.000
Will you help, David?

07:10.568 --> 07:13.280
Hello, Woofer.
- Hi, Dave.

07:13.283 --> 07:16.168
What's in that can?
- Pier.

07:16.220 --> 07:18.196
Donnie is here somewhere?

07:27.533 --> 07:29.858
You're crazy, Woofer.
Seriously disturbed.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.960
I'm black too.

07:31.962 --> 07:35.675
I will complete this stabbing
to an ant war.

07:35.677 --> 07:37.180
Want to bet who will win?

07:37.184 --> 07:41.067
The red will win.
Red ants always win.

08:02.207 --> 08:04.404
In there without calling.

08:04.542 --> 08:06.847
Hey buddy, I am.

08:22.786 --> 08:24.653
Are you there?

08:58.262 --> 09:01.965
That was not funny.
- The face that you drew was.

09:01.974 --> 09:03.801
Help me out with this.

09:05.011 --> 09:06.470
In order to fastest.

09:13.541 --> 09:15.972
Dwarf.
- Mormel.

09:19.816 --> 09:22.435
So you've met her.
- Who?

09:22.911 --> 09:25.860
Oh, your cousin.
Yes, in the rock.

09:25.868 --> 09:28.090
She caught a crayfish
at her first attempt.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.625
Yes, she is quite good at things.

09:30.632 --> 09:33.585
She is beautiful, no?
- She's your cousin?

09:33.592 --> 09:36.400
Step-niece. Ma says
The one difference.

09:36.408 --> 09:40.060
She has one sister, huh?
- Susan? That is disabled.

09:40.064 --> 09:42.480
She did thanks
that accident.

09:42.484 --> 09:45.260
They should always very cautious steps.

09:45.264 --> 09:48.689
She wears those things,
such as polio patients.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.960
Both parents are dead.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.280
Ma said that they were killed.

09:54.287 --> 09:56.875
Ma says she does not know
who had aanreed.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.711
In fact they were
hit by a Chrysler.

10:00.933 --> 10:03.373
Therefore they are now with us.

10:03.840 --> 10:08.278
Ma says Meg lucky.
That she has come good.

10:08.963 --> 10:11.316
What do you louts here?

10:12.640 --> 10:16.677
We go to the carnival.
They have them up this morning.

10:16.798 --> 10:18.775
We shall see.

10:19.595 --> 10:23.351
Another summer between children
and fairs. It can not go wrong.

10:27.420 --> 10:30.234
There's dumb and stupid.

10:30.269 --> 10:32.645
Keep your big mouth,
before I do that for you.

10:32.650 --> 10:35.605
Dad wants to know where you go.
He says you've grounded.

10:35.609 --> 10:37.595
Tell Dad to hell runs.

10:37.602 --> 10:41.285
Now you're in trouble well.
I'll tell him.

10:42.208 --> 10:45.940
Then tell him what you and Cheryl
you did yesterday with pillow.

10:45.945 --> 10:48.629
Hey, fellas.
- Hello Willie.

10:48.963 --> 10:52.480
How was the dentist?
- Shut up, idiot.

10:52.483 --> 10:56.940
Ma was mad at you. She says that
it was your turn to babysit.

10:56.944 --> 11:00.811
I am on, guys.
Time for some real action.

11:02.980 --> 11:06.853
It is summer.
Why we played the game yet?

11:25.237 --> 11:28.545
Are you sure she sees nothing?
- She sees no balls.

11:28.664 --> 11:31.686
Ready to run away?
The big tree is the safe zone.

11:39.588 --> 11:43.256
Stop it, Eddie. I know it's you.
- Shut up.

12:09.672 --> 12:11.335
Hey, bitch.

12:20.269 --> 12:22.045
Walk Donnie!

12:35.601 --> 12:36.832
I got you.

12:43.241 --> 12:48.100
What happens now?
- Now they tell the truth.

12:48.108 --> 12:52.176
A person may ask. The rest looks on.
- I first.

12:53.014 --> 12:54.540
Tell the truth.

12:54.889 --> 12:58.634
Have you kissed a boy?
- No. But you do.

12:59.574 --> 13:01.955
Tell us how you and Cheryl
playing with yourself.

13:01.962 --> 13:04.450
We did not.
- Liar.

13:05.670 --> 13:07.940
Have you ever sucked?

13:08.495 --> 13:11.972
A thick, long, hot dick?

13:12.408 --> 13:14.929
Hold on.
I tell Dad.

13:16.803 --> 13:18.434
What is that?

13:19.640 --> 13:22.241
Tell us what you bitches
those pillows did.

13:32.546 --> 13:34.275
High, huh.

13:34.438 --> 13:35.856
Beautiful.

13:36.777 --> 13:38.465
Are we agreed on?

13:39.730 --> 13:41.922
If you want me.

13:42.027 --> 13:46.162
If you're afraid
it is not very.

13:46.645 --> 13:48.469
Sure.

13:49.864 --> 13:51.666
Forward.

14:00.438 --> 14:03.773
It seems like I can fly
and the whole world.

14:06.073 --> 14:07.581
My parents.

14:10.036 --> 14:15.832
They always like to
bring to an amusement park.

14:16.734 --> 14:19.055
That will now no longer come.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.583
I heard what happened.

14:25.386 --> 14:26.916
Sorry.

14:31.885 --> 14:35.408
This is great, David.

14:37.227 --> 14:39.154
You look as if you do
whole days doing.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.322
Are you serious?

14:41.422 --> 14:42.692
Of course.

14:43.978 --> 14:46.420
I have two tickets,
if you want again.

14:46.422 --> 14:47.997
Very happy.

14:48.549 --> 14:52.943
But I had asked home
of Ruth.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.826
Sometimes she's very funny.

14:58.870 --> 15:01.148
Ruth is great,
exactly one of the gang.

15:15.341 --> 15:20.085
What that whole fair miss,
hoochiecoo is an old-fashioned.

15:20.090 --> 15:21.430
What is a hoociecoo?

15:21.433 --> 15:25.608
Hoochiecoo.
You know, the hoochiecoochie ...

15:25.611 --> 15:28.853
Dancing girls, Ralphie.

15:29.068 --> 15:30.345
And the oddities show.

15:30.350 --> 15:33.197
When I was as old as you,
those things still existed.

15:33.232 --> 15:36.800
I once saw a man with three arms.
- Something does not exist.

15:36.807 --> 15:38.945
Speak to your mother.
I really saw that.

15:39.341 --> 15:41.863
I saw a man with three arms.

15:42.089 --> 15:47.426
One was a tiny stump,
that came here.

15:48.438 --> 15:51.094
What else did you see?

15:51.129 --> 15:53.009
Things in bottles.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.803
Stillborn babies.

15:54.813 --> 15:59.009
Little things shrunk.
Cats and goats, everything.

15:59.953 --> 16:02.930
When I was a little girl,
The fair was worthwhile.

16:02.934 --> 16:04.740
Tell me more
hoochiecoo about that.

16:04.745 --> 16:08.043
I still do not understand it well.
What should the proposals?

16:08.049 --> 16:11.779
Dancing girls, I said.

16:12.573 --> 16:16.890
Some were half naked.
In a very short skirt ...

16:16.896 --> 16:18.960
and a tiny bra.

16:19.325 --> 16:24.560
Or a jewel in the navel.
And painted dark circles.

16:24.565 --> 16:27.337
Here and here.

16:28.228 --> 16:30.929
What do you think that?

16:32.602 --> 16:39.048
But something will our social committee
no sponsors. Not at all.

16:41.193 --> 16:43.203
They would like to do that.

16:43.213 --> 16:44.785
She would really like to.

16:45.487 --> 16:47.860
But they all have one woman.

16:48.732 --> 16:50.755
Drink your beer, boys.

16:50.761 --> 16:52.970
Time to go to the carnival to leave.

16:55.237 --> 16:58.088
We may not last night
not miss.

16:59.506 --> 17:03.354
I go with the boys
get an ice cream at the fair.

17:03.404 --> 17:05.375
Stay here for your
sister to care.

17:05.378 --> 17:07.650
And stay out of the ice box.

17:07.853 --> 17:09.304
You may not be too thick.

17:09.896 --> 17:13.265
Especially if you once
hoochiecoo to the dance.

17:23.641 --> 17:25.545
That I had heard.

17:25.838 --> 17:28.349
Maybe I read it in Playboy.

17:28.354 --> 17:31.444
You read that in Playboy
and I screwed all the bunny's.

17:32.014 --> 17:34.155
My father buys every month
Playboy, asshole.

17:34.160 --> 17:38.075
Have you seen that with Jane Mansfield?
- Yeah, I saw that.

17:38.656 --> 17:42.770
The biggest tits I ever saw.
- Bigger than that of Carol Baker?

17:42.778 --> 17:46.491
Greater than that of June Wilkinson?
- Bigger than Willie.

17:47.863 --> 17:49.160
Where is Donnie?

17:49.164 --> 17:52.108
He may not out of ma
before he has finished eating.

17:53.415 --> 17:55.465
One of you has already seen a woman?

17:56.910 --> 18:00.237
A real woman, I mean.
- Counts Meg them?

18:08.487 --> 18:09.999
See anything?

18:10.065 --> 18:12.545
I'm not even elbow.

18:17.423 --> 18:19.855
Hey, wait.

18:36.236 --> 18:39.476
To hell with her.

18:40.894 --> 18:43.776
Maybe get her
to join the game.

18:47.538 --> 18:50.295
Fucking assholes.

18:55.899 --> 18:57.716
Piers.

18:57.934 --> 18:59.434
I do this.

18:59.591 --> 19:02.948
Look closely again, then
you do the rest.

19:21.655 --> 19:25.105
Looks nice.
Greasy and flavorful.

19:25.110 --> 19:26.747
Take this down.

19:27.331 --> 19:30.394
Note that I want to keep the garden.

19:31.901 --> 19:36.290
And not in the woods.
The wood for themselves.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.381
I will not.

19:41.165 --> 19:44.370
Are you dissatisfied because of
some worms, darling?

19:44.374 --> 19:47.480
No, I just do not ...
- Have you ever.

19:48.301 --> 19:52.832
Here we get a lesson
of femininity, boys.

19:52.965 --> 19:55.407
The sensitive Meg.

19:55.426 --> 20:00.124
You know how girls do
sensitive, not?

20:00.159 --> 20:04.428
And Meg is a lady.
Without doubt.

20:05.329 --> 20:09.510
What am I in hell?

20:09.517 --> 20:13.167
Am I not a lady you think then?
- No, I just wanted ...

20:13.202 --> 20:15.630
Note well what you say.

20:15.633 --> 20:19.300
I suffer no such insinuations
of a child ...

20:19.306 --> 20:22.129
that not even her own face
can clean.

20:23.817 --> 20:27.615
Scroll down and help your sister
with the laundry.

20:27.619 --> 20:31.175
When you're done,
I show you something else.

20:31.610 --> 20:33.905
My boys can handle this.

20:33.940 --> 20:35.659
Right, boys.

20:40.516 --> 20:43.253
A cheeseburger and a lemonade.

20:43.491 --> 20:45.114
Hi Meg, how are you?

20:45.714 --> 20:50.947
Want to buy me something?
I have not eaten in two days.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.277
Can I still get one?

21:00.737 --> 21:02.701
Why did not you eat?

21:04.058 --> 21:05.676
I can not.

21:05.983 --> 21:09.046
Why not?
- I can not.

21:09.569 --> 21:12.490
I do not understand.
- Ruth says I am overweight.

21:15.612 --> 21:20.459
That says it for you to tease.
- David No, she hates me.

21:20.502 --> 21:22.157
Everybody hates me.

21:29.686 --> 21:32.690
Why was she so angry last?

21:32.694 --> 21:35.908
Maybe they just
irritable.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.850
She was not accustomed to
girls in the house.

21:47.808 --> 21:50.082
It is not just this once.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.597
It happens all the time.

21:53.897 --> 21:56.143
I can never do anything right.

21:56.176 --> 21:59.448
When I lie in bed at night
I can think of nothing else.

22:05.051 --> 22:09.857
Before we came here to
I painted.

22:10.323 --> 22:12.567
Just in watercolor.

22:15.364 --> 22:17.930
I do not think I
very good, but ...

22:17.935 --> 22:19.833
My mother liked it.

22:20.043 --> 22:23.569
I've tried, but I
here can not paint.

22:23.790 --> 22:27.837
Because I know what Ruth would do.
I know what she will say.

22:29.346 --> 22:31.372
She would look at me.

22:31.674 --> 22:35.199
And say I'm a stupid weight
and my time trying to peel fresh.

22:35.234 --> 22:37.564
That does not sound like the Ruth I know.

22:38.795 --> 22:41.990
Come on, why do not you?

22:42.025 --> 22:45.055
Why do not you paint watercolor
for Ruth?

22:45.062 --> 22:46.755
She will love it.

22:46.761 --> 22:49.601
I really can not.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.221
Create one for me.

22:53.077 --> 22:56.946
Would you really want?
- Very happy.

23:02.267 --> 23:04.726
I make a painting.

23:06.618 --> 23:12.505
And thanks for everything, David.
- Sure.

23:30.488 --> 23:34.491
I do not want you hanging around outside.
I need your help in the house.

23:35.583 --> 23:38.640
Better to continue immediately.
- Yes, Mrs. Chandler.

23:38.643 --> 23:40.617
Aunt Ruth.

23:49.399 --> 23:53.019
In hell, you even know?

23:55.808 --> 23:57.484
Stupid bitch.

23:58.518 --> 24:01.060
Dinner is ready.

24:02.054 --> 24:05.708
Give the stuff here.
It will brains.

24:06.706 --> 24:10.724
Hello there.
- Hello Mrs Moran. I'm Meg.

24:11.583 --> 24:14.835
How nice to finally
meeting.

24:14.841 --> 24:18.872
Want to come and eat?
- I can not, I ...

24:19.753 --> 24:22.318
I did this to David.

24:29.353 --> 24:33.337
Thanks, Meg.
- It is a bit stupid.

24:33.488 --> 24:36.183
Throw it away but
if you do not like.

24:41.962 --> 24:43.981
What have we here?

24:49.597 --> 24:51.922
That is really nice.

24:53.393 --> 24:55.822
She has something, right?

24:56.708 --> 25:01.181
Mrs. Chandler is happy
to her house.

25:17.974 --> 25:21.025
You must be David.
- Yes. Hi Susan.

25:21.031 --> 25:22.820
Meg says you're nice.

25:23.437 --> 25:27.389
What you got?

25:30.760 --> 25:35.076
I have something for you.
- Turn off the TV, Ralphie.

25:35.661 --> 25:38.596
What is it, David?
- A present.

25:39.725 --> 25:41.381
Meg.

25:46.320 --> 25:49.203
She has painted for you.

25:57.207 --> 25:59.838
It is beautiful, Meg.

26:08.535 --> 26:10.670
Do not kid me.

26:11.135 --> 26:15.030
She made this for you, Davy.
- Surely not.

26:15.036 --> 26:16.230
Just look.

26:16.235 --> 26:20.379
It's a boy to a river.
Course is for you.

26:20.479 --> 26:24.500
Take it. I will not.
- They made it real for you, Ruth.

26:24.505 --> 26:26.515
She just wanted ...
- Do not, David.

26:26.518 --> 26:28.557
Come learn something, guys.

26:29.082 --> 26:31.512
Listen well.
This is important.

26:31.894 --> 26:34.665
You just need love but are
for a woman.

26:34.672 --> 26:38.165
Then she does all kinds
good things for you.

26:38.407 --> 26:39.483
Look at David.

26:39.487 --> 26:43.099
He was kind to Meg
and she gave him a painting.

26:43.187 --> 26:46.782
That is what you got, huh David?

26:48.050 --> 26:50.035
Is that all they gave you?

26:50.039 --> 26:54.235
You're a bit young,
but these days you never know.

26:54.239 --> 26:58.940
Today, girls
so easy. That is their problem.

26:58.945 --> 27:04.350
Promise them a trifle,
and you usually get what you want.

27:04.358 --> 27:07.551
Believe me, I know
I am talking about.

27:07.717 --> 27:09.555
Look at your father, Davy.

27:09.558 --> 27:12.730
He fucked half
the women in this city.

27:12.736 --> 27:15.190
Everyone knows that.
Even your mother knows that.

27:15.196 --> 27:16.985
Do not be ashamed.

27:16.990 --> 27:22.345
He is at least a hard worker,
that his family maintains decent.

27:23.563 --> 27:27.835
Your father would have his own business
when we married.

27:27.841 --> 27:31.800
We would be richer than
my parents were when I was little.

27:31.802 --> 27:35.893
And they were quite rich,
believe me.

27:36.805 --> 27:38.534
And look what I got.

27:38.803 --> 27:43.223
And that beautiful Irish bastard
Noorderzon to the left.

27:43.591 --> 27:47.560
Believe me Fri
Girls are stupid.

27:47.631 --> 27:49.625
Girls are easy.

27:50.709 --> 27:52.248
Bitches.

27:52.283 --> 27:55.178
Through and through.

27:57.669 --> 28:00.570
Take this painting on back, Meg.

28:00.574 --> 28:03.003
I know you've made for Davy.

28:03.612 --> 28:06.739
And try to make me anything else wise.

28:08.153 --> 28:11.499
What I would like to know, Meggie ...

28:11.600 --> 28:14.129
What do you get to this?

28:14.448 --> 28:18.361
We all know that David
a nice guy, but ...

28:18.628 --> 28:21.165
From him you expect nothing.

28:21.170 --> 28:25.606
I only hope that this painting
the only thing you gave him.

28:26.640 --> 28:31.949
You have all men want in the house.
And that's not your painting.

28:35.390 --> 28:41.360
If you guys now what they want
Makes no more than a slut.

28:41.369 --> 28:43.354
You know what a slut is?

28:44.079 --> 28:47.571
Can you, Susan?
Of course not, you're too young.

28:47.766 --> 28:50.840
I will tell you what a slut.

28:50.847 --> 28:55.775
This is someone who's legs
spreads open for a man ...

28:55.782 --> 28:58.901
so he could slip inside.

28:58.936 --> 29:01.761
Stop giggling, Ralphie.

29:02.491 --> 29:06.135
Anyone who is a slut
deserves a punishment.

29:06.140 --> 29:09.889
There will everyone in this city
to accept them.

29:10.869 --> 29:12.597
I am warning you, darling.

29:12.599 --> 29:16.400
If I notice that you hang the slut ...

29:16.409 --> 29:21.043
your ass is a lawn
Aunt Ruth and the lawnmower.

29:23.032 --> 29:25.029
Who wants a beer?

29:35.247 --> 29:38.255
As if I am yesterday.

29:38.259 --> 29:41.791
I always painted for my mother.
I also wanted to try.

29:42.902 --> 29:48.065
I do not care what you
your mother did. You're a slut.

29:48.072 --> 29:52.684
Want to waste your time
a boy?

29:54.992 --> 29:58.200
Hands off.
- You are a liar and a slut.

29:58.209 --> 30:00.581
You can not forget your sister.

30:01.990 --> 30:05.301
What an exemplary behavior.
- Yeah, I think the whole day to him.

30:06.157 --> 30:11.087
So do you act so.
The whole day fantasizing about one boy.

30:12.124 --> 30:15.322
Good night, girls.
It was blissful.

30:50.412 --> 30:52.080
Hold on.

30:56.832 --> 31:00.259
Come watch, David.
She creeps.

31:00.483 --> 31:03.018
Leave me alone, please.
- Grab her.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.508
Why did you do that, bitch?

31:06.511 --> 31:08.630
You've seen what he did.
- He did nothing.

31:09.436 --> 31:11.890
You have his face scratched.
- I'm going to tell Mama.

31:12.257 --> 31:15.150
I want nothing with you
face.

31:15.893 --> 31:19.035
Your sister is a fucking whore.

31:19.042 --> 31:23.065
Can someone tell me
what happens here?

31:23.071 --> 31:26.306
Meg has Woofer attacked.
- She scratched his face.

31:26.869 --> 31:28.545
Someone should have challenged her.

31:28.551 --> 31:32.690
We were tickling her
and when she scratched in Woofers face.

31:32.695 --> 31:34.882
You too, David?

31:35.277 --> 31:40.468
Did you also tickled Megan?
- No, I just came inside.

31:41.553 --> 31:45.470
I do not blame you, sweetie.
I suggest you just one question.

31:45.505 --> 31:48.796
Where is she now?
- I do not know. She ran away.

31:48.887 --> 31:51.566
Susan, you saw what happened here?

31:51.601 --> 31:56.823
And you tried her
to stop when they hit Ralphie?

31:58.176 --> 32:01.785
I could not.
- You had to try, sweetheart.

32:02.004 --> 32:04.522
Meg is finally your sister.

32:06.332 --> 32:09.503
Do you know what it means ...

32:09.533 --> 32:15.340
the accomplice to
of someone doing something?

32:17.551 --> 32:19.935
This means that you may owe.

32:19.937 --> 32:23.885
Even though you yourself might
nothing specifically done ...

32:23.889 --> 32:28.615
yet you somewhere complicit.
Do you understand me?

32:30.381 --> 32:32.630
I will try to explain.

32:32.637 --> 32:34.921
You love your sister, right?

32:35.002 --> 32:40.550
Because you love her,
it would also forgive you, no?

32:40.555 --> 32:43.745
She wanted to hurt him.
She was just angry.

32:43.751 --> 32:48.765
Of course.
But you forgive her, right?

32:50.622 --> 32:53.480
So there you are totally wrong, sweetheart.

32:53.483 --> 32:57.785
This Makes her accomplice.

32:57.791 --> 33:01.670
What they did was wrong.
This is misconduct.

33:01.674 --> 33:07.028
If you forgive her because of you
love her, you're wrong.

33:07.786 --> 33:12.809
Go to on this side of the bed.

33:13.400 --> 33:16.862
Pull your skirt up
and your underpants down.

33:17.574 --> 33:19.588
Come on, do it.

33:19.941 --> 33:23.012
Let Aunt Ruth not force.

33:24.249 --> 33:27.150
Disobedience.
It also comes with.

33:27.158 --> 33:30.300
I give it five for your complicity.

33:31.554 --> 33:33.450
Ten Meg.

33:33.455 --> 33:38.500
And another five for disobedience.
That makes twenty.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.400
Stay here, guys.

33:40.405 --> 33:41.840
Girls just cry.

33:41.847 --> 33:43.995
There is nothing to do.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.756
This is for her own good.
Your presence there contributes to this.

33:55.022 --> 33:57.027
Dare not to touch her ...

33:57.593 --> 34:01.735
Not as fun as your little sister
be beaten.

34:01.742 --> 34:03.382
Right, Megan.

34:03.537 --> 34:06.300
You might teach people
your own age to address.

34:10.866 --> 34:14.509
Hold on, vixen.
- I'm not ready, sweetie.

34:19.614 --> 34:22.487
Please stop.

34:29.608 --> 34:32.128
You have two more credits.

34:35.030 --> 34:36.780
Give me that ring, Meg.

34:37.549 --> 34:40.284
That was my mother.
- Your mother is dead.

34:40.286 --> 34:43.380
You live in my house,
I determine the rules here.

34:43.385 --> 34:45.670
Give me the damn ring.

34:46.145 --> 34:47.889
I gotta go.

34:51.710 --> 34:56.980
This is only a small domestic
disagreement. It remains among us.

34:57.164 --> 34:58.875
You saw what you saw ...

34:59.109 --> 35:02.686
but nobody goes
else to.

35:03.103 --> 35:04.998
Understood?

35:18.717 --> 35:22.670
Hey guys, what do you want?
- A red popsicles.

35:22.746 --> 35:26.985
For me a brown cow.
- Thanks, guys.

35:31.258 --> 35:35.224
What time does the fireworks?
- Around half past eight, I think.

35:55.131 --> 35:57.057
Come sit with us.

36:01.196 --> 36:04.746
Donnie, get a few beers.

36:18.972 --> 36:22.039
You sent a policeman
to my mother.

36:23.950 --> 36:26.490
Sit down, Willie.

36:28.197 --> 36:30.831
Sit down, I say.

36:33.579 --> 36:37.007
What I wonder is
what you expected, Megan.

36:39.336 --> 36:42.534
What went through your head?

36:43.693 --> 36:48.770
Did you really think he is you
road would bring?

36:48.778 --> 36:50.376
You and Susan.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.868
You are away?

36:57.678 --> 37:01.819
I assure you
that it will not happen.

37:03.865 --> 37:08.476
He takes you nowhere,
because he did not care.

37:10.727 --> 37:12.267
What's left?

37:13.136 --> 37:15.153
What else can you do?

37:16.674 --> 37:20.085
Did you think I scared him
would be?

37:34.093 --> 37:36.212
The question is.

37:36.505 --> 37:38.362
What do we do now?

37:40.892 --> 37:47.055
Nothing on this man or to the
Any man scares me.

37:47.061 --> 37:51.010
If you did not know, I hope
that you have by now.

37:51.019 --> 37:55.287
But I can not even five feet
the police to let go.

37:56.972 --> 37:59.355
So the question is ...

37:59.530 --> 38:01.380
What do we do?

38:04.558 --> 38:08.984
Was there a place where you
can go, I would send you there.

38:10.563 --> 38:15.690
I is not stupid slut needed
to damage my reputation.

38:15.695 --> 38:19.828
And they pay me enough
to be stabbing you in much trouble.

38:21.713 --> 38:24.525
I will have another good
about it.

38:27.294 --> 38:29.321
Go to your room.

38:45.726 --> 38:48.818
I mean everyone.

38:54.270 --> 38:56.175
You too, Davy.

38:56.559 --> 39:00.034
Sorry, but I must
think hard work.

39:01.304 --> 39:04.809
Would you go for a beer?
- No, thanks.

39:06.368 --> 39:10.007
Tell your papa but not who gave it to you.

39:10.127 --> 39:13.125
Thanks, Ruth.
- Aunt Ruth.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.370
Have you even thought about?
- What?

39:21.486 --> 39:23.482
Meg to the game
to participate.

39:23.830 --> 39:25.846
We now have our own game.

39:33.338 --> 39:35.299
I think not, David.

39:36.429 --> 39:38.761
I stayed there so often before sleep.

39:38.946 --> 39:40.643
The last time no longer.

39:41.358 --> 39:44.735
Is it because Megan and Susan?
- Yes.

39:46.356 --> 39:50.055
I do not understand.
For me this is the same as before.

39:50.061 --> 39:54.815
It is not the same,
and you know well what is at stake.

39:54.818 --> 39:57.945
I do not know, ma.
- What is it about?

39:58.528 --> 40:02.768
He wants to spend the night there again.
- Besides?

40:03.710 --> 40:05.428
Let him sleep.

40:08.369 --> 40:11.845
You clearly know the latest
developments not.

40:11.873 --> 40:16.358
When the Chandlers live now
two young girls.

40:16.838 --> 40:20.785
Do not be silly, Robert.
- You're silly.

40:20.791 --> 40:22.560
Is there any coffee?

40:31.691 --> 40:33.817
Thanks, Dad.
- Sure.

41:39.169 --> 41:40.640
Now we are complete.

41:40.645 --> 41:43.550
The game is something to tell.

41:43.554 --> 41:46.360
What say?
- A secret.

41:46.365 --> 41:50.135
Sounds good. But how do they
with the gag in her mouth?

41:50.140 --> 41:52.150
They may still not
talk, Mom.

41:52.157 --> 41:55.360
You want something, Meggie?
- No, she's not ready.

41:55.363 --> 41:56.823
What happens now?

41:57.024 --> 42:00.656
Now we take a book.

42:10.237 --> 42:11.780
Confession it.

42:14.074 --> 42:16.287
Take a book down.

42:20.168 --> 42:25.035
Let's see how long they stand it.
- It must have hurt after a while.

42:25.808 --> 42:27.075
She is still too easy.

42:27.079 --> 42:30.815
Should they not be allowed
to confess to?

42:30.821 --> 42:34.785
No, not so fast.
Take away the other book, Willie.

42:41.973 --> 42:44.913
We have to undress her.
- Yes, her dress.

42:45.155 --> 42:47.250
Shut up.
- I do not think this is good ...

42:47.254 --> 42:49.131
We got the admission.

42:51.103 --> 42:52.667
Let her undressed.

42:53.465 --> 42:55.555
That is the game, right?

42:55.825 --> 42:58.227
Then we start it.
- I got it.

42:58.339 --> 43:01.875
Want to save her clothes, ma?
But then I just underpants.

43:01.880 --> 43:03.823
No, I do not care.

43:11.548 --> 43:13.398
I want to hurt you.

43:13.750 --> 43:15.866
But if you try something ...

43:17.353 --> 43:19.428
I will have to.

43:20.136 --> 43:22.140
Do not be stupid.

43:34.168 --> 43:35.633
Please.

44:17.187 --> 44:19.549
No stairs.

44:25.280 --> 44:28.370
Ready to confess, Megan?

44:28.380 --> 44:30.216
Let me do the rest.

44:30.957 --> 44:33.024
Then let her confess.

44:41.388 --> 44:43.642
Now you can confess.

44:44.241 --> 44:45.966
Get the ropes.

44:54.450 --> 44:57.917
Do you untie my arms?
They really do hurt.

44:58.610 --> 45:01.868
You get no more.
- Come, confession.

45:02.040 --> 45:04.160
Tell us how you play with yourself.

45:04.170 --> 45:06.403
You stick your finger in there might not?

45:06.438 --> 45:10.427
Tell us what you do.
- In the sly.

45:13.633 --> 45:16.014
Is David here?
- Yes, that is here.

45:21.421 --> 45:24.220
Where is Susan?
- That there is.

45:24.226 --> 45:27.020
The hell with Susan,
where is your confession?

45:27.028 --> 45:29.216
I have nothing to confess!

45:34.862 --> 45:37.753
Let me go.

45:39.653 --> 45:41.575
Touch not that girl.

45:41.579 --> 45:44.655
I do not want one of you
touch her.

45:45.152 --> 45:47.490
One girl even if it is not proper.

45:47.494 --> 45:50.425
Keep your hands off her.
Understood?

45:53.444 --> 45:56.245
First we have the gag
back into her mouth.

45:56.248 --> 45:57.858
That is totally disgusting.

46:02.643 --> 46:03.965
So it is not dirty.

46:03.971 --> 46:07.026
They may not all night
are called. Push him into it.

46:14.005 --> 46:17.202
Maybe you have a slightly
thinking, girl.

46:17.252 --> 46:19.430
About two things even.

46:19.435 --> 46:20.562
First.

46:20.567 --> 46:25.285
Your little sister before you can hang
instead of you.

46:25.292 --> 46:26.570
And second.

46:26.576 --> 46:31.625
I know what nasty things you did.
And I wanted them to hear from you sometimes.

46:31.630 --> 46:36.180
Perhaps this confession
yet so no children's game.

46:36.187 --> 46:39.125
Either I hear it from one ...

46:39.130 --> 46:42.290
I hear either of the other.

46:42.294 --> 46:44.465
Think about it.

47:05.288 --> 47:07.507
I wonder how it feels.

47:08.374 --> 47:12.555
As long standing position with hands
tied above her head.

47:15.698 --> 47:17.466
It must hurt.

47:18.387 --> 47:20.139
Terribly hurt.

47:21.274 --> 47:23.827
Have you seen her?

47:24.437 --> 47:26.519
How they looked.

47:27.663 --> 47:30.690
Down there.
- I've never seen anything like it.

47:31.482 --> 47:33.780
Let us go see what they make.

47:33.786 --> 47:37.300
Then we have another good look.
- Are you crazy? Mama would hear.

47:37.304 --> 47:40.300
We can silently.
- Are you kidding?

47:40.302 --> 47:43.555
Even if farting
under the sheets, they hear it already

47:56.496 --> 47:57.908
Silence.

47:58.242 --> 48:00.285
She'll want some water.

48:00.292 --> 48:03.282
You idiot. If we give her water
we must remove the prop.

48:03.317 --> 48:06.090
So what?
She will not make noise.

48:06.347 --> 48:09.520
You will make any noise he Meg?

48:09.524 --> 48:12.645
Otherwise make your mom awake.

48:12.651 --> 48:17.041
If they make noise, they find problems.
She is not stupid.

48:36.038 --> 48:39.825
My arms and my shoulders
do so much.

48:39.830 --> 48:42.397
Maybe we can ...
- A little.

48:42.919 --> 48:47.150
On one condition.
- All you ask.

48:47.290 --> 48:50.415
You must promise that you will not fight
and you will tell it to anyone.

48:50.422 --> 48:51.652
Never.

48:52.203 --> 48:54.511
What say?
- You know.

48:57.582 --> 49:01.268
We will hurt you,
we only want to touch it.

49:01.419 --> 49:03.105
None of you will touch me.

49:03.112 --> 49:07.425
Wrong. Who will stop us?
- I.

49:07.432 --> 49:10.480
Really? How?

49:11.339 --> 49:14.940
You will only get one chance to
touching me, you bastards ...

49:14.958 --> 49:18.083
for I will start screaming.

49:22.973 --> 49:24.910
That leaves the ropes where they are.

49:24.915 --> 49:27.002
And you get back a lump in your mouth.

49:27.052 --> 49:28.981
And that's that.

49:29.554 --> 49:31.076
Well.

49:31.090 --> 49:33.013
Gag me.

49:34.281 --> 49:37.056
And then make out of here.

49:37.653 --> 49:39.490
We do that.

49:39.525 --> 49:40.985
Open your mouth.

49:41.195 --> 49:42.685
Remember our deal.

49:42.693 --> 49:44.541
You got your water.

49:45.182 --> 49:49.423
But we have not been.
Understood?

49:52.147 --> 49:55.381
Come on guys, learn the ropes
looser. Ruth will not see.

49:55.488 --> 49:58.882
Look at her.
It takes long before the morning.

50:10.187 --> 50:11.981
Goodbye.

50:25.043 --> 50:26.532
Forward.

50:32.688 --> 50:35.625
Eat your toast on, sweetie.

50:35.874 --> 50:41.607
Come on sweetie, eat some of.
- Better not.

50:41.932 --> 50:44.875
I will not squander food, Meg.

50:44.882 --> 50:46.840
I made that toast for you.

50:46.845 --> 50:49.268
What do you want me to do?
Discard it?

50:49.604 --> 50:51.800
Put him there.
I eat it later on.

50:51.807 --> 50:53.735
This attracts insects.

50:53.802 --> 50:55.970
Cockroaches and ants.

50:55.977 --> 50:59.050
I do not want bugs in the house.

50:59.056 --> 51:02.250
You must eat now.
While fresh.

51:02.254 --> 51:06.685
I would eat it,
but I can hardly swallow.

51:06.690 --> 51:08.785
I will drink tea.
Is that good?

51:08.790 --> 51:11.640
Nobody has said
it would be easy.

51:11.645 --> 51:17.215
You're a woman, Meg.
And that's not easy.

51:18.732 --> 51:19.954
Eat.

51:23.440 --> 51:27.140
You have broken my head, damn.

51:31.011 --> 51:33.240
Do you think tea is cheap?

51:33.248 --> 51:35.925
I've not broken.

51:35.930 --> 51:37.630
What is this?

51:38.359 --> 51:41.165
Who will clean up the mess?

51:41.173 --> 51:44.015
I do though.
I promise.

51:44.022 --> 51:46.249
Susan, come here.

51:47.398 --> 51:52.463
You love Meg down, the
case they mean or stupid to do.

51:53.961 --> 51:56.047
Come stand here.

51:57.643 --> 51:59.915
So we clean the floor.

51:59.921 --> 52:02.056
We start with the slut.

52:02.642 --> 52:04.850
We will insert a new regulation.

52:04.854 --> 52:06.385
Once you disobey ...

52:06.392 --> 52:09.837
speaks to me, strengthens me energy,
anything, missy ...

52:09.872 --> 52:12.290
will pay them.

52:12.294 --> 52:14.013
We will try that.

52:14.261 --> 52:16.373
Do you think honestly, Suzie?

52:16.589 --> 52:20.196
Do you think you should pay
for what your dirty sister doing?

52:20.696 --> 52:23.861
No.
- Of course not.

52:24.325 --> 52:27.065
But nobody says
that life is fair.

52:28.779 --> 52:32.659
Put the dress the girl up
and pull her panties down to Mama.

53:05.002 --> 53:06.240
Where you going?

53:06.245 --> 53:07.550
I need help with my dad.

53:07.553 --> 53:11.337
We will later play in the water tower.
Involvement

53:34.718 --> 53:37.688
Have you ever seen a guy
a girl look whack?

53:38.591 --> 53:42.625
I think so.
Drunks or children.

53:42.630 --> 53:45.945
Have you ever wondered
or could do?

53:45.951 --> 53:48.440
You mean if I got talking?

53:54.356 --> 53:55.893
This is a difficult question.

53:56.093 --> 53:59.003
A woman is a man
sometimes rod hunting.

53:59.053 --> 54:03.030
But you must always think
that the weaker sex.

54:03.034 --> 54:05.243
And you're not tough.

54:10.519 --> 54:12.340
But despite ...

54:12.348 --> 54:13.956
I have seen women who
it deserved.

54:13.965 --> 54:16.265
If you work in a bar that you see sometimes.

54:16.270 --> 54:19.440
A woman has too much to drink.
She is bold and boisterous.

54:19.443 --> 54:22.340
Sometimes they give a stab at the man
who is with her. What should they do?

54:22.345 --> 54:23.803
Sit?

54:25.347 --> 54:26.925
So he gives her a slap.

54:26.930 --> 54:30.464
But you just said ...
- There are exceptions to the rule.

54:31.253 --> 54:33.801
You should never hit a woman.

54:34.173 --> 54:36.598
And I care but
you never see it.

54:37.268 --> 54:38.925
But sometimes ...

54:40.376 --> 54:42.475
you are bound.

54:42.480 --> 54:45.005
Because they have driven too far.

54:45.499 --> 54:47.687
But for both parties.

54:49.201 --> 54:50.705
Good advice.

54:50.711 --> 54:55.009
Keep your hands off and makes you
your own business. Man or woman.

54:55.317 --> 54:57.532
You will avoid problems.

55:33.722 --> 55:36.381
Hi, Susan.

55:38.488 --> 55:40.525
Ruth is here somewhere?

55:41.006 --> 55:43.921
She is top of the rest.

55:50.115 --> 55:52.775
I can not stop them.

55:52.831 --> 55:56.296
Do you?
- I know.

55:58.894 --> 56:01.376
I would do it I can.

56:14.337 --> 56:17.077
Do not you think it enough?
- Not dicks.

56:21.891 --> 56:24.197
Get up, piece of shit.

56:25.041 --> 56:26.802
Your turn to tie her down.

57:38.461 --> 57:41.022
Were you forget something, David?

58:37.549 --> 58:39.573
Sorry.

58:42.132 --> 58:44.600
I have something to say.

59:23.667 --> 59:25.345
Stop moving.

59:30.745 --> 59:33.415
Good morning, David.

59:35.456 --> 59:39.847
Take a beer if you want.
- Maybe later.

59:43.735 --> 59:45.671
Goddamn, Donnie.

59:51.537 --> 59:54.224
Now we close fires.

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:01.441
Shut up.

01:00:02.481 --> 01:00:05.904
Shut up or I'll do it again.

01:00:10.535 --> 01:00:14.307
You go look.
Careful.

01:00:15.676 --> 01:00:17.272
Did you hear me?

01:00:18.132 --> 01:00:22.013
I said:
Shut up or I'll do it again.

01:00:24.128 --> 01:00:27.085
Do they handle
when someone at the door?

01:00:27.942 --> 01:00:30.110
Should you not control that, Ruth?

01:00:30.114 --> 01:00:32.423
Suppose again
Mr. Jennings is.

01:00:32.639 --> 01:00:34.806
Who?
- The police, Ruth.

01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:43.000
I can monitor her for you.

01:00:43.005 --> 01:00:46.323
Her guard.
- To ensure that they are not running away.

01:00:49.553 --> 01:00:53.187
But monitor her.
Good idea.

01:00:59.491 --> 01:01:04.930
If I hear a noise, I died
you both. I promise.

01:01:04.938 --> 01:01:09.080
Not simply punish, but murder.
Death.

01:01:09.089 --> 01:01:14.554
Do you understand that, David?
Is that clear? Well.

01:01:14.994 --> 01:01:16.880
Very good.

01:01:33.431 --> 01:01:34.880
Here she comes.

01:01:35.896 --> 01:01:37.315
Good afternoon, Mrs. Chandler.

01:01:37.317 --> 01:01:40.830
I was in the neighborhood and come to see
how the girls go.

01:01:40.836 --> 01:01:44.295
That is kind.
They make it very well.

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:46.424
Come in, please.

01:01:54.511 --> 01:01:56.555
The girls are going shopping.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.945
Want a cup of coffee?
- No thanks, Mrs. Chandler.

01:01:59.952 --> 01:02:04.409
Or a glass of lemonade?
It is such a hot day.

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:10.334
No thanks.

01:02:10.902 --> 01:02:14.174
I will help you out, Megan.
I have some money saved.

01:02:14.608 --> 01:02:16.639
Everything is okay.

01:02:17.052 --> 01:02:20.513
I make sure that nothing
Susan happens.

01:02:21.582 --> 01:02:26.852
And that is all right
when you return.

01:02:27.725 --> 01:02:29.613
Go to the police.

01:02:30.406 --> 01:02:32.574
And show them this.

01:02:36.639 --> 01:02:38.893
Tonight.
I promise.

01:02:48.924 --> 01:02:51.240
He is my shadow.

01:02:51.304 --> 01:02:53.555
Ms. Chandler, I ...

01:02:53.562 --> 01:02:55.835
Everyone calls me Ruth.

01:02:56.332 --> 01:03:00.170
I got a call from
Ms Marina from the street.

01:03:00.174 --> 01:03:02.420
Apparently, her eldest son, Tony ...

01:03:02.423 --> 01:03:05.485
We know Tony very well.
A very sweet boy.

01:03:05.489 --> 01:03:11.319
He told his mother that his boys
Meg saw whack away.

01:03:11.815 --> 01:03:16.245
You know that children always exaggerate.
It would have been a familieruzietje.

01:03:16.252 --> 01:03:18.973
He told her that she
used as a punching bag.

01:03:19.699 --> 01:03:22.024
Something my boys would never do.

01:03:28.459 --> 01:03:30.845
How did he know?
- What did he know?

01:03:30.851 --> 01:03:34.022
Did you tell him?
- As told? What do you mean?

01:03:34.027 --> 01:03:35.950
Do not kid me, David.

01:03:35.954 --> 01:03:38.430
According to her ma told you that Jennings
at the door.

01:03:38.436 --> 01:03:39.985
How did you know that he was?

01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:42.500
I assumed that.
- You had or guessed.

01:03:42.505 --> 01:03:45.100
I just wanted Ruth ...
- What did you do to her?

01:03:45.105 --> 01:03:49.156
I wanted her here wegkrijgen.
She looked exactly a zombie.

01:03:49.397 --> 01:03:51.709
She was indeed quite strange.

01:03:53.001 --> 01:03:54.728
That is true.

01:03:55.523 --> 01:03:58.405
What happens to Meg?
- What do you mean?

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:02.962
We need something that burns
lubrication, for they become infected.

01:04:04.144 --> 01:04:05.745
To hell with her.

01:04:06.388 --> 01:04:08.842
I'm not quite finished with her.

01:04:10.657 --> 01:04:12.555
But then ...

01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:14.392
I am perhaps.

01:04:16.131 --> 01:04:17.551
I do not know.

01:04:19.462 --> 01:04:21.477
I just do not know.

01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:14.913
Turn that TV softer, Ralphie.

01:05:51.245 --> 01:05:53.030
I will leave the back door.

01:05:53.863 --> 01:05:57.788
They will think that I forgot.
Give me half an hour.

01:05:57.792 --> 01:06:03.060
Here, take this.
- I can not do this, David.

01:06:04.097 --> 01:06:06.795
If something goes wrong.

01:06:06.799 --> 01:06:09.045
And they find it in me.

01:06:09.053 --> 01:06:11.825
Then they will know you were here.

01:06:12.877 --> 01:06:16.132
And then we never get any chance.

01:06:18.565 --> 01:06:20.608
Hide it for me.

01:06:20.611 --> 01:06:22.410
Among the large stone.

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:31.435
You have really gone, believe me.

01:06:32.878 --> 01:06:36.017
I'm so sorry.

01:06:37.475 --> 01:06:40.386
It is the last thing you did
that is important.

01:08:15.917 --> 01:08:19.322
Come in and close the door.

01:08:54.808 --> 01:08:56.526
Stay here.

01:08:58.609 --> 01:09:01.473
There good for you, girl.

01:09:07.636 --> 01:09:10.792
You will now have a disease,
but that's not bad.

01:09:10.796 --> 01:09:13.122
Today they
there treatments.

01:09:14.545 --> 01:09:17.474
I want my mommy.
- Shut up, dammit.

01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:23.575
Who wants another round?
Eddie? Davy?

01:09:23.578 --> 01:09:24.600
I want it.

01:09:24.604 --> 01:09:28.984
I do not know. So right after your brother.
That seems incest.

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:31.685
Come on, ma.
- No, not really.

01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:34.654
It would be here hooker
do not care, but ...

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.962
it seems to me ...

01:09:37.283 --> 01:09:42.526
much more appropriate as it would be Eddie
or Davy.

01:09:43.658 --> 01:09:48.381
Perhaps you are wise guys.
I would not touch her in any case.

01:09:48.416 --> 01:09:51.490
But I'm just not a man.

01:09:51.499 --> 01:09:54.785
I just want to cut her.
- Me too.

01:09:54.789 --> 01:09:56.095
Cutting?

01:09:56.101 --> 01:10:00.055
Why let her fuck you Donnie?
- Shut up, I am talking to Ralphie.

01:10:00.778 --> 01:10:02.290
What do you mean cut, baby?

01:10:02.296 --> 01:10:05.861
Something in her letter, so everyone
knows that she is a whore.

01:10:12.585 --> 01:10:15.593
We cut it, ma.

01:10:20.696 --> 01:10:23.469
This show you do not do?

01:10:24.105 --> 01:10:26.300
The boys have decided.

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:29.566
So we do it.

01:10:30.041 --> 01:10:33.790
You know what that slut
wanted to do last night?

01:10:33.795 --> 01:10:35.916
She tried to get out of here.

01:10:36.245 --> 01:10:39.083
Someone left the door open.

01:10:39.118 --> 01:10:44.590
We think it was Donnie.
He was here last.

01:10:44.595 --> 01:10:48.360
And he's always been kind to her.

01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:52.600
Why can not I?
- What then?

01:10:52.604 --> 01:10:53.880
Fuck her.

01:10:53.887 --> 01:10:57.550
As I say, damn.
That's incest.

01:10:57.554 --> 01:11:01.493
Would you mess your brothers in dirt?
You're disgusting.

01:11:01.497 --> 01:11:04.487
Just like your father.
Say nothing to me.

01:11:04.679 --> 01:11:06.362
This may not make you, Ruth.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.001
No?

01:11:08.358 --> 01:11:10.150
This is not right.

01:11:10.159 --> 01:11:14.134
Please tell me no
hear or what not, boy.

01:11:14.808 --> 01:11:18.650
Never say that to me.

01:11:22.413 --> 01:11:24.040
Here we go.

01:11:26.026 --> 01:11:28.135
We will have heat.

01:11:28.139 --> 01:11:30.545
Otherwise she gets an infection.

01:11:35.051 --> 01:11:38.552
I'm outta here.
- You're not going anywhere.

01:11:39.854 --> 01:11:42.000
I want to see this.

01:11:42.007 --> 01:11:44.500
Close your eyes, damn.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.695
See?

01:12:38.843 --> 01:12:40.885
That there forever, Meggie.

01:12:40.892 --> 01:12:43.097
You will never have married.

01:12:43.307 --> 01:12:46.931
You will no
exposing your clothes.

01:12:48.973 --> 01:12:51.202
That is best for you.

01:12:51.473 --> 01:12:53.166
No man will want you.

01:12:53.168 --> 01:12:55.425
You will never have problems with children.

01:12:55.431 --> 01:12:57.008
Price you happy.

01:12:57.857 --> 01:13:00.985
You liked to be nice to see.

01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:02.870
To be sexy.

01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:07.000
This world is a woman
more ugly.

01:13:10.874 --> 01:13:14.045
So many states they are no longer.
- I told you.

01:13:14.053 --> 01:13:16.349
A woman knows such things.

01:13:21.925 --> 01:13:24.288
She does not look out.

01:13:24.668 --> 01:13:26.415
Fuck me.

01:13:26.418 --> 01:13:29.415
You would better her
hang again.

01:13:31.677 --> 01:13:33.082
Hold on.

01:13:34.099 --> 01:13:38.595
We have ensured
that no man will want her.

01:13:38.602 --> 01:13:40.829
But the problem is.

01:13:49.685 --> 01:13:51.999
That Meg perhaps even
a man wants.

01:13:52.369 --> 01:13:54.580
Then life becomes a torture.

01:13:54.586 --> 01:13:58.969
A woman is not over her
a body man.

01:13:59.004 --> 01:14:02.917
She wants him only
at a particular place.

01:14:03.296 --> 01:14:05.760
You know what I'm talking about?

01:14:05.764 --> 01:14:08.140
That'll come, dear.

01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:12.008
A woman wants a man
between her legs.

01:14:12.012 --> 01:14:13.939
In a small place.

01:14:14.106 --> 01:14:17.008
If you spot away ...

01:14:17.058 --> 01:14:19.076
You know what happens then?

01:14:19.542 --> 01:14:22.735
Then you take away her desire.

01:14:22.739 --> 01:14:25.761
You take that away forever.
That succeeds.

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:28.105
In some countries they always do.

01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:32.558
It is very common
as a girl a certain age.

01:14:32.937 --> 01:14:37.173
In Africa, for example,
in New Guinea.

01:14:37.479 --> 01:14:40.668
They find it even
a civilized custom.

01:14:41.013 --> 01:14:45.305
So I wonder
why would we not do?

01:14:45.802 --> 01:14:50.091
We just take
that one little spot away.

01:14:50.495 --> 01:14:52.791
We burn it away.

01:14:52.898 --> 01:14:56.844
Then our work will be perfect.

01:15:03.119 --> 01:15:05.815
What do you think you going?

01:15:05.819 --> 01:15:09.655
Wanted this to your whore of a mother
to tell?

01:15:09.661 --> 01:15:12.345
If you wanted to send Jennings agent?

01:15:12.561 --> 01:15:14.695
Now hear her.

01:15:14.699 --> 01:15:19.410
I do not know what to do with you
to do, but I find something.

01:15:19.416 --> 01:15:23.840
Be happy that you have no place
as it has.

01:15:23.846 --> 01:15:28.863
But you yourself have two boyfriends
where you can to make sure.

01:15:31.359 --> 01:15:33.105
Tie him up, boys.

01:15:39.573 --> 01:15:41.215
Where were we?

01:17:41.281 --> 01:17:44.605
You hate me?
- Not at all.

01:17:47.128 --> 01:17:48.833
And even Meg.

01:17:49.662 --> 01:17:52.003
It's all my fault.

01:17:52.472 --> 01:17:57.400
Without Meg yesterday i had to
run away and never return.

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:59.547
She has tried, Susan.

01:18:01.732 --> 01:18:03.550
But they have caught her.

01:18:03.553 --> 01:18:06.828
She grabbed her when she came up
to fetch me.

01:18:07.831 --> 01:18:11.470
She could not leave.

01:18:11.474 --> 01:18:13.353
I left the door open.

01:18:14.067 --> 01:18:17.030
She would come and collect you later.

01:18:17.034 --> 01:18:19.585
Why is not immediately fled?

01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:23.269
Probably because ...

01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:27.183
It happens that Ruth ...

01:18:28.121 --> 01:18:30.654
touching me.

01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:34.590
At one time she did me bleed.

01:18:34.596 --> 01:18:36.004
I told Meg.

01:18:36.007 --> 01:18:41.035
That was very angry and told Ruth
she knew what she did with me.

01:18:41.038 --> 01:18:43.902
And when Ruth began beating her.

01:18:43.912 --> 01:18:45.798
She hit her very much.

01:18:46.502 --> 01:18:48.780
She had to run away without me.

01:18:48.783 --> 01:18:51.982
I've never liked it
pain was made.

01:18:53.838 --> 01:18:57.790
Calm down, it will be fine.

01:19:00.688 --> 01:19:04.872
No Meg, do not.

01:19:06.626 --> 01:19:09.227
I'm here, and Susan is there.

01:19:12.649 --> 01:19:16.375
It hurts so much.

01:19:16.383 --> 01:19:17.866
Do not move.

01:19:23.936 --> 01:19:25.644
Sorry, Megan.

01:19:26.821 --> 01:19:28.926
I am so sorry.

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:31.537
It is good, Susan.

01:19:34.732 --> 01:19:37.817
We have tried.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.000
Is it night?

01:19:42.007 --> 01:19:44.120
Therefore, I think ...

01:19:44.123 --> 01:19:46.937
my parents are worried
if I did not come home.

01:19:46.972 --> 01:19:51.625
I can not, David.
- Rest.

01:19:54.441 --> 01:19:57.445
I have to find something that I
can hurt them.

01:19:57.452 --> 01:19:59.568
So we miscarry.

01:19:59.863 --> 01:20:01.675
There is nothing.

01:20:01.681 --> 01:20:04.699
You know how many times
I've tried?

01:20:04.734 --> 01:20:06.460
There is something.

01:20:09.227 --> 01:20:10.798
Maybe.

01:20:12.671 --> 01:20:15.496
But there must have something else
done.

01:21:33.307 --> 01:21:35.430
Put the knife away.

01:21:35.433 --> 01:21:37.458
Throw it away, I say.

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:44.261
Take him away.

01:21:59.591 --> 01:22:01.525
What happened?

01:22:01.527 --> 01:22:03.948
It was Ruth, Mr. Jennings.

01:22:04.362 --> 01:22:06.195
It was Ruth.

01:22:06.591 --> 01:22:08.974
She has done Meg.

01:22:09.054 --> 01:22:10.811
Because that gave her problems.

01:22:11.977 --> 01:22:14.665
Stay here with her.

01:22:43.661 --> 01:22:45.480
Not talking.

01:22:46.742 --> 01:22:49.015
Would you do me a favor?

01:22:49.451 --> 01:22:51.266
Of course.

01:22:54.505 --> 01:22:57.858
Want the ring of my mother
return?

01:23:33.508 --> 01:23:35.359
Thank you.

01:23:40.468 --> 01:23:44.043
I thought it was a dream.

01:23:47.986 --> 01:23:51.779
That you tried to help me.

01:23:54.745 --> 01:23:56.695
A dream.

01:23:59.945 --> 01:24:02.969
But it was no dream.

01:24:03.985 --> 01:24:08.221
You have not abandoned me.

01:24:13.088 --> 01:24:16.086
Do you mind?

01:24:24.321 --> 01:24:27.023
Now she can ...

01:24:29.021 --> 01:24:32.557
I do not hurt anymore.

01:24:38.953 --> 01:24:43.333
You will now take care of me, right?

01:24:48.292 --> 01:24:51.124
And Susan too?

01:24:59.156 --> 01:25:02.104
I do not think I will save.

01:25:04.935 --> 01:25:07.224
I love you.

01:26:04.354 --> 01:26:06.685
The past always catches up to you.

01:26:06.687 --> 01:26:08.894
Whether you like it or not.

01:26:11.559 --> 01:26:16.029
This can be a gift,
or a curse. If you allow that.

01:26:38.251 --> 01:26:41.456
I will never be the gift
Meg Loughlin forgotten.

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:46.140
Although I am haunted by
the agony that I have failed ...

01:26:46.143 --> 01:26:48.330
somebody to save.

01:26:50.362 --> 01:26:52.309
But as she taught me ...

01:26:53.557 --> 01:26:56.745
What you did last,
is important.
