00:09.884 --> 00:11.761
Hey, y'all, it's your girl Joya

00:11.845 --> 00:13.847
about to do an interview
with her daughter,

00:13.930 --> 00:16.599
future NYU student. What what?

00:16.683 --> 00:20.478
#momlife, #Tischlife, #Joyalove.

00:20.895 --> 00:21.813
[kisses]

00:22.981 --> 00:24.024
You ready now?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.859
-Yes, camera ready.
-[Drea] Great.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.153
-So, tell me--
-One more thing. Sorry.

00:28.236 --> 00:31.656
Hey, everybody. Should I move to New York
with my daughter? Oh!

00:32.574 --> 00:35.660
[Drea] <i>So if you can't tell,</i>
<i>my mom's been going through it.</i>

00:35.744 --> 00:37.620
Has been for a minute.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.330
Ever since she left the law firm,

00:39.414 --> 00:42.250
she's been trying to figure out
what her next move might be.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.169
There was a YouTube cooking channel.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.797
What you want to do
is get these peppers real small,

00:47.881 --> 00:49.966
as small as you possibly--

00:50.050 --> 00:51.426
Ow! Shit.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.429
There was a political podcast.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.766
If you're gonna get out there
and be the leader of the free world,

00:57.849 --> 00:59.976
I want you to do something good
with your hair.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.146
And now in the last few months,
she's decided to write a book.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.774
I probably
should have mentioned this earlier, but

01:05.857 --> 01:07.859
based on everything
she's done in the past,

01:07.942 --> 01:10.987
I never thought there was a chance in hell
she'd finish this thing.

01:11.071 --> 01:15.283
In an attempt to promote her miracle book,
she's been introduced to social media.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.452
It hasn't been great.

01:17.994 --> 01:21.122
Mom, can you please take a second
from your followers

01:21.206 --> 01:24.084
-and answer a couple questions for me?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

01:24.167 --> 01:27.253
So, why did you introduce yourself
like that at my school?

01:28.004 --> 01:28.963
Like what?

01:29.714 --> 01:33.301
Oh, fuck! Give her two cc's of Propofol
before she wakes up!

01:33.593 --> 01:36.679
That should keep her asleep another hour
or two until I can get back.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.432
No. No, it's not unethical.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.476
It's called how I practice medicine.

01:41.851 --> 01:45.438
Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn't
have gotten your nursing degree online!

01:47.732 --> 01:49.442
Let me know if you need any, uh, help

01:49.526 --> 01:51.444
deciphering that fine print
on the auction form.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.570
Yeah. I got it.

01:52.987 --> 01:56.449
It's just I-- I had a client once
who thought she was buying a blender

01:56.533 --> 01:59.285
and instead she got a beach house.
You know? [chuckling]

01:59.619 --> 02:01.037
I'm Joya. I'm a lawyer.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.289
I don't see what the problem is.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.875
Did you have to say that you're a lawyer?

02:06.084 --> 02:07.794
Couldn't you have just stopped
at your name?

02:07.877 --> 02:09.546
I could have, yeah,

02:09.629 --> 02:13.466
but to give objective resonance
to the fact that I was offering--

02:13.550 --> 02:16.052
free, I might add-- legal advice,

02:16.136 --> 02:19.931
I thought it would be good to mention
that I am, in fact, a lawyer.

02:20.014 --> 02:24.018
I think you were standing there
in your designer sweats and Prada boots

02:24.102 --> 02:25.812
and you saw a woman in scrubs,

02:25.895 --> 02:28.398
probably drenched
in some kind of bodily fluid,

02:28.481 --> 02:32.610
I mean, clearly committing malpractice,
but, um... also bossing up,

02:32.902 --> 02:35.029
and it kind of made you miss being a boss.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.740
It made you feel
like you had to reach inside your bag

02:37.824 --> 02:41.077
and pull out the most awkward,
unnecessary flex of all time.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.246
The hell are you talking about?

02:43.329 --> 02:46.791
I don't have to miss being a boss,
because I am a boss.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.085
Are you, though?

02:49.169 --> 02:50.086
Yeah, I am.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.840
I graduated at the top of my class
and I am a corporate fucking lawyer.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.216
I guess.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.553
I mean, Mom, you haven't been
in a courtroom in what? Like...

02:58.678 --> 02:59.512
three years?

02:59.596 --> 03:02.098
You're smart because you're my daughter,

03:02.348 --> 03:04.976
but I forgot more than you know.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.897
I love you, but I will take you down.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.649
<i>♪ You either with me or against me, ho ♪</i>

Can you believe this little bitch?

03:25.747 --> 03:27.373
She came for me.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.625
Like, hard.

03:28.708 --> 03:29.876
Am I a lawyer?

03:29.959 --> 03:32.086
That's completely out of line.
Am I right?

03:32.170 --> 03:36.174
<i>Absolutely wrong because you definitely,</i>
<i>technically, by the rule of the law</i>

03:36.257 --> 03:38.051
<i>are absolutely still a lawyer.</i>

03:38.134 --> 03:39.344
<i>-Technically.</i>
-[Joya] Mm-hmm.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.511
Damn straight I am.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.430
I haven't practiced in three years.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.974
It doesn't matter if I hadn't practiced
in three decades.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.018
I got that JD, okay?

03:47.101 --> 03:48.102
[woman on phone] <i>You did, girl.</i>

03:48.186 --> 03:49.270
[Joya] And had six kids!

03:49.354 --> 03:51.898
Even if I had given
all those six kids away,

03:51.981 --> 03:53.191
that is still my degree.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.902
<i>Look at God! Won't he do it? Yes, he will.</i>

03:55.985 --> 03:58.321
Can you please not do that,
'cause it makes me feel

03:58.404 --> 04:00.490
like you're not taking me seriously
when you do that.

04:06.579 --> 04:10.083
Look Par Par, I don't know what you did,
but I'm glad you did it.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.627
Like, it had to be done.
So, thank you so much.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.337
It should have been me, but...

04:14.587 --> 04:17.340
as usual, it was you,
and it's probably always going to be you.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.175
But thank you so much.

04:19.425 --> 04:22.262
You're the hero this family deserves,
like a real hero.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.348
You're Malcolm X, you're James Baldwin.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.685
You're Latrell Sprewell
choking PJ Carlesimo.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.979
<i>You're Arya Stark,</i>
<i>you're Tyrion Lannister.</i>

04:31.938 --> 04:34.691
This is the toughest part
about making a documentary.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.484
The proverbial moral quandary.

04:36.859 --> 04:39.028
I mean, you see a woman set on fire.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.906
What do you do?
Do you put out the fire?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.659
Or do you zoom in and let her burn?

04:47.370 --> 04:49.747
<i>You're that old white dude</i>
<i>who landed the plane in the Hudson,</i>

04:49.831 --> 04:52.458
although he's not really a hero.
He kinda just crashed good.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.584
You're the Pope.

04:54.043 --> 04:57.463
Not-- Not John Paul, he's cool.
You're the new one.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.299
The one who's, like, down gay people.

05:00.758 --> 05:03.386
So what's your take on mom not working?

05:03.761 --> 05:07.140
Your mom's a hard-working lady.
Always has been, that's her thing.

05:07.223 --> 05:08.933
She's a trooper, I love that about her.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.727
I don't think she ever took off

05:10.810 --> 05:13.354
really more than three months
for any of you guys.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.480
Um...

05:14.772 --> 05:16.482
then when she was pregnant
with little Brook,

05:16.566 --> 05:19.944
she got this thing called pre-eclampsia,
he ended up coming, like...

05:20.278 --> 05:22.572
a couple of months early.
It was-- It was crazy.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.033
Um, we didn't know if he was
gonna make it, to be honest with you.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.784
He was in the NICU for a while.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.786
Shit, we didn't know if she'd make it.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.706
So, when they both
ended up pulling through,

05:31.789 --> 05:33.499
we knew they'd need some time,

05:33.875 --> 05:36.753
so we decided she'd stay home,
you know, be with the kids.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.088
Be a mom for a while,
something she hadn't done before.

05:39.547 --> 05:43.092
That was a little over three years ago.
Twelve hundred...

05:44.052 --> 05:46.095
and 31 days, to be exact.

05:46.637 --> 05:50.016
Well, how long did you think it'd take?
And what'd you think she'd be doing?

05:50.099 --> 05:52.226
We never really set an exact time,

05:52.852 --> 05:54.896
but I don't think any rational person
would think

05:54.979 --> 05:58.316
we'd be looking at our 4th calendar year
with no end in sight.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.235
I guess I figured she'd be...
taking care of the kids,

06:01.319 --> 06:03.654
you know, since that's what
she said she'd be doing.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.283
Not ignoring you guys
and doing whatever it is she does.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.118
What-- What it she doing right now?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.370
Is she still doing the book?

06:10.453 --> 06:11.537
-Is that her thing?
-Yes, Dad.

06:11.913 --> 06:12.955
Hm. Okay.

06:13.998 --> 06:17.043
I'm sure they don't think
that I'm, like, doing this--

06:17.126 --> 06:18.878
-Hey, babe!
-Yo! What up?

06:19.128 --> 06:21.130
I made some breakfast, if you want some.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.051
-You made chili con quiles?
-Yeah.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.970
-Mmm. Killed it.
-You remember Lavette?

06:28.054 --> 06:30.306
Um, I do. What up, Lavette? How are you?

06:30.390 --> 06:31.808
-Good. Nice to see you.
-Good to see you.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.059
-Yet again.
-Say hi to Jasmine.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.977
-[Kenya] Hey Jas, everybody's here.
<i>-Hey!</i>

06:35.061 --> 06:35.937
[Kenya] Working woman.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.565
-What's going on? Where are the kids?
-I dropped them off at school.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.110
You dropped them off?

06:42.193 --> 06:44.112
While you're getting
your hair and makeup done?

06:44.195 --> 06:46.072
No, I had them dropped off.
It's the same thing.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.615
Hmm.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.033
[softly] No, it's not.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.576
-Did you say something?
-Huh?

06:51.661 --> 06:53.037
Did-- It sounded like you said something.

06:53.121 --> 06:56.249
No. I was--
I'm gonna get some of this bacon...

06:56.332 --> 06:58.167
-Okay.
-...that you made.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.377
-[Joya] Huh?
-Huh?

06:59.794 --> 07:01.546
Did you--
Did you want to say something to me?

07:01.629 --> 07:03.798
-No.
-You didn't say anything about the bacon?

07:04.424 --> 07:05.341
I don't think so.

07:05.716 --> 07:08.136
-He definitely said something.
-He definitely said something.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.638
-He definitely said something.
-He's on that shit right now with me.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.224
<i>-Maybe you should listen to him more.</i>
-[Joya] Huh? 

07:13.516 --> 07:14.767
-[Joya] What?
<i>-Hmm? </i>

07:16.060 --> 07:18.438
[Drea] So, Mom,
this new chapter in your life,

07:18.521 --> 07:20.231
what do you call it? What are you doing?

07:20.314 --> 07:21.607
Well, essentially,

07:21.691 --> 07:25.736
I am just taking my life experiences
and sharing them with people.

07:26.237 --> 07:30.408
And I'd like to see myself as, you know,
an inspiration to black women.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.492
You do?

07:32.326 --> 07:33.286
Yeah.

07:34.579 --> 07:35.663
Like, really?

07:36.664 --> 07:37.707
Yeah, really.

07:39.959 --> 07:40.793
Really?

07:41.752 --> 07:43.421
Why? You don't?

07:44.547 --> 07:47.508
[sighs] We're not supposed to be going
back and forth. Let's just keep going.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.636
Let me explain to you
why I'm an inspiration.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.722
Somebody like Michelle Obama.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.057
-She's the GOAT, obviously.
-[mouthing] Michelle Obama?

07:55.141 --> 07:56.309
[Joya] We all love her.

07:56.392 --> 07:59.645
Untouchable. I will put respect
on her name forever, but...

08:00.271 --> 08:01.522
she's royalty, right?

08:01.606 --> 08:03.941
The woman hasn't driven a car in 15 years.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.904
I'm in the trenches with working moms,
doing the damn thing

08:07.987 --> 08:09.155
every day.

08:09.238 --> 08:11.449
"Trenches" feels strong.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.242
So does "working."

08:13.743 --> 08:14.785
I'll be honest with you,

08:14.869 --> 08:17.914
"Mom" even feels like
a little bit of a stretch at this point.

08:17.997 --> 08:22.335
You know Lupe was hired originally
as Brooklyn's newborn nurse, right?

08:22.877 --> 08:23.836
[Drea] Really?

08:23.920 --> 08:26.631
Yeah. The super expensive person

08:26.714 --> 08:30.551
with a super specific job
of taking care of a newborn infant.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.011
-[electricity crackling]
-[laughing]

08:32.094 --> 08:33.888
[Kenya]<i> There's usually</i>
<i>a pretty short window</i>

08:33.971 --> 08:36.891
<i>because they're for newborn infants.</i>

08:37.725 --> 08:39.018
That's the name.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.561
Newborn nurse.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.396
Why don't you just get rid of her?

08:42.480 --> 08:45.149
We can't just get rid of Lupe. Okay?

08:45.233 --> 08:49.487
That $25 an hour we pay her barely
supports her family back in Guatemala.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.155
How much are we paying her?

08:51.239 --> 08:54.659
Besides, her Coco Fresco's license
just expired.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.245
It didn't expire.
It was revoked and it should've been!

08:57.328 --> 09:00.248
She could've killed somebody!
Things are made out of dairy!

09:00.706 --> 09:02.917
We live in Encino,
it's 95 degrees outside.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.336
I don't care
how big your umbrella is, Lupe.

09:05.419 --> 09:08.339
You can't just shove them in some kind
of handmade woven wicker basket

09:08.422 --> 09:11.467
and put ice on top of them, start
handing them out to neighborhood kids.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.010
Fuck is wrong with you?

09:14.011 --> 09:17.014
And it's pretty obvious
that Brooklyn's outgrown a newborn nurse.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.100
[gentle instrumental music]

09:19.183 --> 09:21.185

18:54.007 --> 18:55.134
-If you have to.
-Oh. Uh...

18:55.801 --> 18:56.760
Well,

18:57.052 --> 19:01.807
I mean, I-- I guess I could see
if my husband could go instead, but I...

19:02.349 --> 19:04.685
No. No, it's-- it's--
It's fine. Seriously.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.938
Are you sure?
Because it kind of doesn't feel fine.

19:08.021 --> 19:10.107
Leez, it's fine. Look, I get it.

19:10.190 --> 19:13.986
You're a mom who has a job
and you're trying to manage both of them.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.530
That's admirable,
you know what I'm saying?

19:16.613 --> 19:19.908
You're not managing this one, you know,
great, but I feel like--

19:20.242 --> 19:24.538
I'm also into the fact that you probably
made an agreement with your husband,

19:24.621 --> 19:27.708
and you're sticking to that,
which is super great.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.501
I respect that, trust me.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.254
You know, but you're not sticking
to this one very great,

19:32.337 --> 19:34.965
but it's cool. Seriously.
Do what you have to do.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.843
I got kids too, but I'm here.

19:38.260 --> 19:42.014
[sighing] I can-- I can--
You know what? I can cancel.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.266
Honestly, you can go.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.351
No, it's okay. I'm gonna stay.

19:49.771 --> 19:50.689
Okay.

19:52.149 --> 19:52.983
Okay.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.526
You cool, playboy?

19:55.819 --> 19:56.862
Yeah, I'm--

19:56.945 --> 19:59.615
I'm cool. I'm-- I'm coolio.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.033
All right. Let's get back to work.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.993
And you are staying?

20:03.076 --> 20:05.162
-Yeah, I'm staying.
-She's staying. Okay.

20:05.954 --> 20:06.955
Your choice, though.

20:07.039 --> 20:07.998
Wanna take five real quick?

20:08.081 --> 20:09.541
-[Broadway] Yeah, I think we should.
-Yeah.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.752
-You're staying, though, right?
-Yeah.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.545
-You're in?
-[sniffling]

20:13.629 --> 20:14.671
[Kenya] Okay, cool.

20:15.505 --> 20:18.217
One thing I hate?
Fucking crying at work.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.636
It makes everybody feel weird.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.262
Check that shit at the door, dude.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.556
Don't bring your emotions to work,
work is work.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.016
Leave the personal stuff at home.

20:26.099 --> 20:29.186
Me and Jo had an agreement!
We had a deal!

20:29.978 --> 20:34.024
You renege on a deal in the streets,
in the streets you can end up dead.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.194
-That's real talk. Real real.
-[Kenya] That's the rule of the streets.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.488
So you're saying
he's going to kill his wife.

20:39.571 --> 20:43.575
-He's not going to kill his wife.
-I mean, a deal is a deal.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.328
Wait, what-- what is it
that you're actually saying?

20:46.411 --> 20:47.496
[Leeza] Oh, my gosh.

20:47.579 --> 20:48.872
Dude, I'm telling you.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.874
This is not the woman I married.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.501
-Really?
-No.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.836
What, do you think it's,
like, a man trapped inside?

20:54.920 --> 20:57.297
Like on some reverse
Bruce Jenner type shit?

20:57.381 --> 20:59.591
Caitlyn! Her name is Caitlyn!

20:59.675 --> 21:02.427
His mama named him Bruce.
I'm finna call him Bruce.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.972
-God, you are so ignorant.
-Bitch, you ignorant.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.014
[all overlapping] Whoa.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.683
-[Leeza] Okay, ow.
-[Broadway] Damn!

21:07.766 --> 21:10.894
I know that Broadway
probably went through a lot as a kid,

21:10.978 --> 21:14.022
but my God, he's like a character
out of a Hughes brothers movie.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.567
I don't think
you can call a woman a bitch.

21:17.651 --> 21:20.529
I have the HR manual. You cannot.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.072
[Mikayla] Thank you.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.992
Their name is Caitlin, right?

21:25.075 --> 21:26.910
-That's how we's to be--
-Better.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.829
So you're saying your wife has changed.

21:28.912 --> 21:31.206
That's not the woman I married.
I married a lawyer.

21:31.748 --> 21:34.167
Yo, blood, I mean, she's still a lawyer.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.503
Matter of fact, she's helping me prep
my slip and fall case

21:36.586 --> 21:38.463
I got against a children's hospital.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.382
What?

21:40.465 --> 21:43.343
I mean, I appreciate everything they did
for little Broadway, but...

21:43.593 --> 21:46.722
man, them floors in the burn ward
are hella overwaxed.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.099
My God.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.519
How-- How is little Broadway?

21:52.602 --> 21:55.439
Thanks for asking. He's good.
Both eyes are almost open now.

21:55.522 --> 21:56.440
[Mikayla] Oh, my God.

21:56.523 --> 21:59.484
How did he get burned in the first place,
if you don't mind me asking?

21:59.568 --> 22:01.570
I don't know. I wasn't there.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.488
Oh, were you...

22:03.989 --> 22:04.906
here?

22:05.407 --> 22:07.034
[Kenya groans]

22:07.117 --> 22:08.744
I mean, he's a lot.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.370
-A lot.
-Yeah.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.040
Like, he's just in my grill all day.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.292
I feel not even comfortable
in my own house

22:15.375 --> 22:17.419
'cause he's just watching
every little move,

22:17.502 --> 22:19.546
fuckin' micromanaging me.

22:19.629 --> 22:20.797
This morning,

22:20.881 --> 22:24.009
he was mad because I didn't physically
take the kids to school.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.054
I mean, who cares? Did they make it there?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.013
Mm.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.349
A-- Are you asking?

22:30.432 --> 22:33.685
Because I don't know.
I mean, I hope they made it.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.937
I mean, there's probably somebody
that knows, right?

22:36.396 --> 22:39.358
Yeah, me. I know.
I'm their mom. I got them there.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.944
You know, I-- I actually agree with you.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.697
Maybe he's, like, sipping Lean
or something. I don't know.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.157
-[scoffs]
-[Jasmine] What?

22:47.240 --> 22:49.576
Sipping Lean. It's like the new hot thing.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.079
It's not new, and you know
when someone's sipping Lean.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.581
-Lean is cheap and it's easy to hide.
-Oh, my God.

22:55.123 --> 22:58.502
I don't-- It's not that,
but I do not know what his problem is.

22:58.585 --> 23:01.463
I mean,
I kept up my end of the bargain, right?

23:01.546 --> 23:03.090
I didn't work for a while,

23:03.173 --> 23:06.301
but now
I am contributing financially again

23:06.385 --> 23:07.677
-because of the book...
-[both] Yeah.

23:07.761 --> 23:10.847
...and now I've regained
some of the ground that I lost to him.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.350
-But he's now just fucking with me!
-Wait, wait.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.519
-Sorry, you lost ground to him?
-[Joya] Yeah.

23:15.602 --> 23:18.146
I mean, you're talking about all of this
like you guys are at war.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.900
I'm sorry, as someone who represents
several women who were previously married,

23:22.025 --> 23:23.402
-they are definitely at war.
-Mm-hm.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.279
-Come on!
-And you remember, Jas,

23:26.363 --> 23:28.657
I mean, I was the one
who was making more money.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.991
I was the breadwinner.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.785
I get it, but I just don't think

23:31.868 --> 23:34.830
that, um, there should be a competition
between you guys.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.290
"Breadwinner" has the word "winner" in it.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.876
-Implies that there's a breadloser.
-[Lavette and Jasmine chuckle]

23:39.960 --> 23:41.420
Do I look like a loser to you?

23:41.503 --> 23:45.257
Oh, my God, no wonder you're getting
such wack vibes outta him. Come on!

23:45.549 --> 23:47.634
I mean, isn't marriage
supposed to be a partnership?

23:47.717 --> 23:49.886
Spoken like a true breadloser.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.304
-[scoffs]
-[Jasmine] Okay.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.306
I'm just saying, seriously, like,

23:53.390 --> 23:55.809
this is-- Is this what you guys agreed on?

23:55.892 --> 23:58.979
Girl, he was super supportive about this.

23:59.062 --> 24:02.899
He was like, "Take time off!
Take all the time you need!"

24:02.983 --> 24:05.402
-[Lavette] Yeah, they start like that.
-And then, all of a sudden,

24:05.485 --> 24:07.904
acted like he hit his head
and had amnesia.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.906
I mean, but hadn't you just almost died?

24:10.031 --> 24:13.243
I mean, people say all kinds of shit
during a traumatic experience.

24:13.326 --> 24:16.538
I thought I was going to die
during a flight once,

24:16.621 --> 24:20.333
and it was rough,
and I let a guy give me cunnilingus.

24:21.918 --> 24:22.919
A stranger.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.588
And that didn't count.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.465
Oh, no, that absolutely counted,

24:26.548 --> 24:30.302
and you can absolutely take him literally
because you two had a deal.

24:30.385 --> 24:31.261
-Right?
-Yes.

24:31.344 --> 24:33.388
He reneged on an agreement.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.849
That's the kind of shit
you get shot for in the streets.

24:35.932 --> 24:37.851
That's the kind of shit
that'll get you fucked up.

24:37.934 --> 24:41.146
-That's what I'm saying. A deal is a deal.
-It's some bullshit. For sure.

24:41.229 --> 24:44.191
Do you understand how crazy it is

24:44.274 --> 24:45.692
to think that, in this world,

24:45.775 --> 24:50.071
the idea of two successful black people
being married is, like, almost insane?

24:50.155 --> 24:52.782
I never even thought it was possible
until I saw <i>The Cosby Show.</i>

24:52.866 --> 24:55.952
And as soon as I saw that,
I was like, "That's what I want."

24:56.286 --> 24:59.206
And that's what me and Jo were.
And now we're not.

25:00.123 --> 25:02.584
I mean, can't you cut her a little slack?

25:02.667 --> 25:06.922
She worked really hard for over 20 years
and she had, like, 15 kids for you.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.381
[Kenya] You sound ridiculous.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.467
Leeza, she had, like, six kids,

25:10.717 --> 25:13.720
And every day of her life
has basically been like the life of Riley.

25:14.221 --> 25:16.181
Didn't she almost die in childbirth?

25:17.015 --> 25:19.768
That was, like, three years ago.
She's been fine ever since.

25:21.811 --> 25:23.563
You know your dad's a bad guy, right?

25:24.314 --> 25:26.066
-Yeah, you know it.
-I...

25:26.858 --> 25:29.319
I'm not saying I don't understand
people growing and maturing

25:29.402 --> 25:31.196
and changing and all that dumb shit.

25:31.279 --> 25:33.532
But like, what's up with her
suddenly wanting to be

25:33.615 --> 25:37.369
like, an influencer, slash author,
slash whatever the fuck it is she's doing?

25:37.452 --> 25:38.787
What's that all about?

25:38.870 --> 25:40.413
Maybe she's just an attention whore.

25:41.164 --> 25:43.375
Dawg, do you have to call my wife
a whore?

25:43.917 --> 25:44.793
Oh, okay, then.

25:44.876 --> 25:48.213
I just thought that "attention bitch"
would be so much more disrespectful,

25:48.296 --> 25:50.757
but I don't know y'all relationship.

25:51.174 --> 25:54.177
All right, just pause, Broadway.
Stop talking.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.512
Um...

25:55.595 --> 25:58.265
Maybe she's trying to protect
her marriage.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.475
This is relationship insurance.

26:00.934 --> 26:03.144
She's branding the two of you
as a power couple.

26:03.228 --> 26:06.439
That way, if you step out,
you're not just stepping out on her.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.775
You're stepping out on the beloved brand.

26:08.858 --> 26:10.235
[all] Whoa. 

26:10.318 --> 26:11.152
[Nelson] Damn!

26:11.695 --> 26:13.530
That shit is diabolical.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.240
It's personal branding.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.742
Yes, JoJo! Yes.

26:17.826 --> 26:21.371
And I got to be the Hollywood wife
and arm candy

26:21.454 --> 26:23.456
whether I like it or not, right?

26:24.082 --> 26:26.710
And I'm the smart, pretty lawyer

26:26.793 --> 26:28.920
that elevates his game.

26:29.254 --> 26:32.716
So why can't I use the same thing
to elevate my game now?

26:32.799 --> 26:34.426
-[Lavette] Absolutely.
-You know, I get it.

26:34.551 --> 26:35.635
You know, I get all of it.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.887
But... you know,

26:38.013 --> 26:41.266
don't you think all of this and that

26:41.349 --> 26:42.350
is just a bit much?

26:42.434 --> 26:44.853
Who's that? That's one of Jo's friends
who was fucking some guy

26:44.936 --> 26:46.730
that she just met on the airplane.
I don't know.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.106
Do I think that's too much?

26:48.189 --> 26:49.357
-Hell no.
-Okay.

26:49.441 --> 26:53.194
No, this, all of this,
is reparations, okay?

26:53.403 --> 26:56.448
Between breastfeeding,
studying for the bar,

26:56.531 --> 26:59.117
helping the kids study
for their stupid tests,

26:59.200 --> 27:01.369
being in my heels all day
running around in court,

27:01.453 --> 27:03.538
then coming home,
making sure everybody's fed.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.333
Not to mention the fact
that I got to run back out

27:06.416 --> 27:08.710
for all of his
last-minute red carpet events,

27:08.793 --> 27:10.337
and make sure I don't look ratchet

27:10.420 --> 27:13.423
next to some Brazilian broad
who's been in the spa all day.

27:13.506 --> 27:16.051
I mean, I haven't slept for 15 years.

27:16.134 --> 27:19.304
So yes, hell yes, I'm grabbing my moment.

27:19.387 --> 27:22.891
I put his ass in the spotlight
so I'mma take some of that too.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.225
Well, what about your girls?

27:24.809 --> 27:26.061
What about my girls?

27:26.269 --> 27:30.482
I mean, don't you think just giving up
a high-powered position

27:31.107 --> 27:32.317
might have an effect on them?

27:32.400 --> 27:35.320
Giving up?
I didn't give anything up. I'm just...

27:35.445 --> 27:36.905
starting something new.

27:36.988 --> 27:39.949
I teach my kids to bet on themselves

27:40.033 --> 27:41.951
and to take risks like their mom does.

27:42.369 --> 27:45.413
Guys, that was just my friend
who used to do Lean.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.500
He ran down all the symptoms.
We have a serious problem.

27:49.376 --> 27:50.210
Oh, my God.

27:51.586 --> 27:52.420
Well...

27:53.713 --> 27:54.714
Well, what?

27:55.507 --> 27:58.677
Is what I'm doing
having a positive effect on you?

27:59.260 --> 28:01.680
Oh, my God. Yes!
Mom, you're killing it.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.098
I mean, you're a dope lawyer

28:03.181 --> 28:05.266
and you look better
than all of my friends' moms.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.769
And now have a book
that you're about to drop on 'em

28:07.852 --> 28:09.062
and shut down Borders.

28:09.145 --> 28:11.439
I think Borders is already shut down.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.857
Okay, shut up, nerd.

28:13.441 --> 28:14.651
My point is

28:15.026 --> 28:16.111
you are "goals."

28:16.820 --> 28:18.571
-Thanks, babe.
-No problem.

28:21.157 --> 28:22.117
Drea?

28:22.200 --> 28:23.034
[Drea] Hm?

28:23.576 --> 28:25.620
I mean, you're definitely "goals,"

28:25.912 --> 28:27.580
depending on what your goals are.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.500
And what's that supposed to mean?

28:31.876 --> 28:34.796
You should just do whatever you want
and not worry about what I think.

28:34.879 --> 28:37.716
Yeah, that's-- that is not
how motherhood works at all.

28:37.799 --> 28:38.842
[chuckles]

28:39.384 --> 28:42.429
If you're asking if I still wish
you were practicing...

28:43.054 --> 28:45.140
the answer is...

28:45.473 --> 28:46.349
um...

28:46.599 --> 28:47.976
Yeah?

28:48.560 --> 28:49.477
...complicated.

28:50.061 --> 28:53.523
I mean, when you were working a lot,
there were definitely times

28:53.606 --> 28:56.025
where you seemed seconds
from a mental breakdown.

28:56.443 --> 28:57.444
I was.

28:57.861 --> 28:58.778
There was...

28:59.738 --> 29:03.408
weeks-- years actually, that I wasn't sure
I was going to make it through.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.744
To be honest, your whole childhood.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.080
But the only reason
I barely kept it together

29:09.164 --> 29:11.207
was because you needed me to.

29:11.624 --> 29:12.959
What I mean is,

29:13.334 --> 29:15.044
you're the reason I'm so driven.

29:15.503 --> 29:18.465
Watching you hustle
had a huge impact on me.

29:19.132 --> 29:22.469
Even as a little kid,
I saw the impact it had on other people

29:22.552 --> 29:24.429
when I told them my mom was a lawyer.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.389
It made me feel proud.

29:27.015 --> 29:27.891
But...

29:28.308 --> 29:31.603
now that I'm old enough
to actually see you argue a case in court,

29:31.895 --> 29:32.771
I can't.

29:33.229 --> 29:35.315
Just because
we can't see her do it right now

29:35.398 --> 29:37.484
doesn't mean
we'll never see her do it again.

29:37.567 --> 29:40.695
Or maybe you do something
that'll inspire us more.

29:42.822 --> 29:45.325
[scoffs]
I guess I didn't think of it like that.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.369
For what it's worth, Mom,

29:48.453 --> 29:52.874
I'm always going to be proud of you
because you're kind of my hero.

29:54.417 --> 29:57.796
But I do hope that I get the chance
to see you in action again,

29:58.296 --> 29:59.130

30:46.594 --> 30:48.763
Like, there's obviously a problem here.

30:50.598 --> 30:53.101
All right, you wanna know
what my problem is, Jo?

30:53.810 --> 30:56.145
-Yeah.
-It's that I'm trying, man.

30:56.437 --> 30:58.690
I just don't know
that this is working for me.

30:58.773 --> 31:00.149
Whatever it is we're doing.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.070
Okay. [scoffs] Well...

31:05.864 --> 31:08.533
this not working for you
is not working for me.

31:08.658 --> 31:09.492
Of course.

31:09.576 --> 31:12.036
So, like, instead of just being weird,

31:12.120 --> 31:14.289
why not come talk to me
about the way you're feeling?

31:14.372 --> 31:16.499
What do you think I'm trying to do now?

31:16.583 --> 31:20.128
I was trying to do it, but--
What does it matter, dude? We're here.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.005
What is going on, man?

31:22.088 --> 31:24.757
Like, it used to be me and you,
like Bonnie & Clyde,

31:24.841 --> 31:26.050
Jay and B, like...

31:26.634 --> 31:27.927
all of a sudden now,

31:28.011 --> 31:30.221
I feel like we're more competitors
than partners.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.224
What are you talking about?
You've always been competitive.

31:33.308 --> 31:36.311
-You're, like, the king of competition.
-Can I please finish?

31:37.103 --> 31:37.937
Yeah.

31:38.521 --> 31:39.898
I don't know what's going on,

31:39.981 --> 31:41.983
but whether it's silly shit or work shit,

31:42.066 --> 31:44.903
I'm always-- It's like you're always
trying to one-up me.

31:45.528 --> 31:48.531
-I don't want to use the word "jealous"--
-But you just did.

31:49.490 --> 31:50.909
Okay, you know what it is?

31:51.784 --> 31:52.744
Honestly?

31:53.328 --> 31:56.539
And you're not gonna like this,
but I feel like you have beef with me

31:56.623 --> 31:59.834
because you wake up next to someone
every day who loves what they do,

32:00.084 --> 32:02.837
and you haven't quite figured out
what it is you want to do yet

32:02.921 --> 32:04.547
and I'm paying the price for it.

32:06.424 --> 32:10.178
I can't believe that you would think that,
and then say it out loud.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.931
And by the way, if it were true,
just for the sake of argument,

32:13.014 --> 32:14.432
okay, let's say I was unhappy,

32:14.515 --> 32:17.435
wouldn't it kind of be on my partner,
my husband,

32:17.518 --> 32:19.812
the father of my six kids to, like,

32:19.896 --> 32:22.398
support me? Like, talk me through that?

32:22.482 --> 32:25.401
Figure my shit out with me
instead of just, like...

32:25.777 --> 32:27.111
being angry and resentful

32:27.195 --> 32:29.572
and throwing little jabs at me
on a daily basis?

32:29.656 --> 32:32.283
I'm not trying to throw jabs at you, dude.
I'm just saying, like, I--

32:32.367 --> 32:34.035
I don't even recognize you sometimes.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.870
I had a tiny bit of contouring.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.914
No, I'm not talking about that, dude!

32:37.997 --> 32:40.208
You know what?
Maybe I am talking about that.

32:40.291 --> 32:45.588
When did I suddenly not realize that you
hated the life we built together so much?

32:45.672 --> 32:49.300
I don't hate the life we built together.
It's just very different.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.177
This-- It's changed! It's not what we--

32:51.260 --> 32:53.137
But we knew that that would happen.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.057
We knew what we were headed to together.
We had a plan.

32:56.724 --> 33:00.478
And I feel like, all of a sudden,
it feels like you abandoned that plan,

33:00.853 --> 33:03.439
you know, because we got some money.

33:04.232 --> 33:05.942
-Oh, wow.
-Oh, wow.

33:06.025 --> 33:07.902
Seriously. What a fucking asshole.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.113
-Okay, I'm-- 'Cause I'm--
-I was the money, okay?

33:10.196 --> 33:12.865
-I know that! I know that!
-I busted my ass!

33:13.324 --> 33:15.827
Worked, was a mother, was your wife,

33:15.910 --> 33:18.287
worked all the time
so that you could have the freedom

33:18.371 --> 33:19.664
to just, like, go off

33:19.747 --> 33:21.958
and come up with whatever stupid shit
you were coming up with.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.251
-Stupid shit? Really?
-That's because of me.

33:23.334 --> 33:26.587
But my stupid shit
is paying for this life.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.424
Okay? And nobody's saying
that you didn't bust your ass

33:29.507 --> 33:31.676
or don't bust your ass or aren't dope.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.678
You're my girl, like, I love you.

33:33.970 --> 33:36.305
But all of a sudden,
with you not working,

33:36.389 --> 33:38.725
you now have more nannies,
more housekeepers,

33:38.808 --> 33:41.436
you've somehow convinced the gardener
to start washing the cars.

33:41.519 --> 33:42.770
That's just efficient.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.064
But what is that efficiency getting us?

33:45.148 --> 33:46.232
Other than, what,

33:46.315 --> 33:49.193
you to become the basketball-wife version
of John Grisham?

33:51.612 --> 33:52.864
Okay, you know what? I'm...

33:52.947 --> 33:56.701
I'm just going to walk away now
because this is about to get ugly.

33:57.368 --> 34:02.206
And I'mma take my basketball-wife,
John Grisham ass upstairs, take a bath,

34:02.290 --> 34:03.666
have a glass of wine.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.168
You're welcome to join me,

34:05.251 --> 34:06.753
but if you don't, that's cool.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.629
-I'm just not going to do this.
-You're not gonna do what?

34:08.713 --> 34:10.923
I'm not doing--
I'm just not doing this ugliness.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.216
Okay.

34:16.012 --> 34:19.682
In the movies, we always see
that arguments have an ending.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.019
But in real life, they don't.

34:23.936 --> 34:25.646
They just stop to start up again.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.858
<i>And the best you can hope for is that</i>

34:29.025 --> 34:31.194
