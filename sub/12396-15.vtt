This isn't right, Shawn. Nope.

53:02.549 --> 53:06.052

Who is it from?

53:32.496 --> 53:33.863
There's no return address.

53:33.914 --> 53:35.164
This dude has a strange relationship

53:35.232 --> 53:36.249

Nothing. Not anymore.

Whatever it is, maybe
it's still lying around.

53:42.372 --> 53:44.423
Bottom line, Z brought it to the house,

53:44.508 --> 53:46.008
Elisa finds it,

53:46.076 --> 53:48.427
and whatever she does
with it makes her dead.

Ooh.

01:09:57.479 --> 01:09:58.613
Steak? You mean pie.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.614
You're thinking pie.

01:09:59.681 --> 01:10:00.898
No, I mean steak.

01:10:00.983 --> 01:10:02.450
I have pie after I have steak.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.907

01:10:09.992 --> 01:10:11.742

01:10:11.827 --> 01:10:14.578

01:10:16.331 --> 01:10:18.332
Yang, do not go towards
the light. Stay with me.

01:10:18.383 --> 01:10:21.168
Stay right here with me and
tell us who the killer is.

01:10:21.219 --> 01:10:25.256
I can't do that. That
would spoil the ending.

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:28.309

Oh, fellows, I don't have
time. I'm on in a few.

01:13:16.897 --> 01:13:19.114
It's funny. You had plenty
of time to try and kill me.

01:13:19.136 --> 01:13:20.470
What?

01:13:20.537 --> 01:13:21.305
You played Jack the Ripper

01:13:21.306 --> 01:13:22.770
in the original production, didn't you?

01:13:23.305 --> 01:13:24.772
And in this current incarnation,

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.224
you've been relegated
to the much smaller role

01:13:26.308 --> 01:13:27.725
of the inspector.

01:13:27.735 --> 01:13:28.868
Which could have easily been played

01:13:28.936 --> 01:13:30.653
by a local black actor regardless

of the racial makeup
of 19th-century London.

01:13:33.157 --> 01:13:36.326
You took out your revenge
on Elisa and the producer

01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:38.128
and anybody else who had any kind of stake

01:13:38.212 --> 01:13:41.414
- in this current production.
- Yep.

01:13:41.465 --> 01:13:44.417
- And...
- And that's it.

01:13:44.468 --> 01:13:46.719
No, there's more. Tell him the more.

01:13:46.787 --> 01:13:47.587
There's no more. That's it.

01:13:47.638 --> 01:13:49.005
What?

01:13:49.090 --> 01:13:50.423
That is the flimsiest theory

01:13:50.474 --> 01:13:51.925
you've ever come up with, Shawn.

01:13:51.976 --> 01:13:53.176
By no means the flimsiest theory that...

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:54.894
Why are you working against me on this?

01:13:54.962 --> 01:13:56.312
That's not a motive for
someone that killed someone.

01:13:56.397 --> 01:13:57.931
He killed the critic to save the show.

01:13:57.982 --> 01:14:00.133
Maybe he thought he deserved
to be rewarded for that.

01:14:00.184 --> 01:14:03.103
- It doesn't make sense.
- It doesn't make sense?

01:14:03.154 --> 01:14:05.271
I saw you practicing your spin move.

01:14:05.322 --> 01:14:06.356
But everybody in the play does that move.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.907
It's how you get off a rope.

01:14:07.975 --> 01:14:09.526
We're taught that on the first day.

01:14:09.610 --> 01:14:11.194
Look, I don't know why
you did what you did.

01:14:11.278 --> 01:14:12.812
And I don't care, but I
can prove that you did it

01:14:12.863 --> 01:14:14.831
because Yang slashed our attacker

01:14:14.915 --> 01:14:16.482
across the chest right before he turned

01:14:16.534 --> 01:14:18.118
and stabbed her to death.

01:14:18.169 --> 01:14:19.836
- Now take off your shirt.
- And do it slowly.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.821
Yeah, but not...

01:14:21.872 --> 01:14:23.456
- not because we're titillated.
- No.

01:14:23.507 --> 01:14:24.507
Because we don't want any funny business.

01:14:24.592 --> 01:14:25.875
Right.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.460
Look, this is getting really weird.

01:14:27.511 --> 01:14:29.095
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah.

01:14:29.163 --> 01:14:31.047
I lost a lot of oxygen because of you

01:14:31.132 --> 01:14:33.800
and the only clinically insane
friend that I've ever had.

01:14:33.851 --> 01:14:36.936
Now, take off that shirt
or I'll do it for you.

01:14:37.004 --> 01:14:39.389

01:14:46.513 --> 01:14:48.648
- Gus, take off his shirt.
- What?

01:14:48.699 --> 01:14:50.700
I'm not taking off an
unconscious guy's shirt, Shawn.

01:14:50.784 --> 01:14:52.202
- He's a killer.
- I don't care.

01:14:52.286 --> 01:14:54.154
Oh, for Pete's sake.

01:15:00.211 --> 01:15:02.328
Gah.

01:15:04.048 --> 01:15:06.032

embarrassing for both of us.

Yes, and you idiots are doing his play.

No, we're doing a Jack the Ripper story.

01:15:38.819 --> 01:15:41.104
Ben, the director, wrote this new version.

01:15:41.155 --> 01:15:42.989
It's a completely different show.

01:15:45.025 --> 01:15:46.943
I've heard tell they've seen him.

01:15:46.994 --> 01:15:49.078
- Seen who?
- The Ripper.

- Shawn, I'm almost done.

01:15:53.701 --> 01:15:55.368
Where are you?

01:15:55.452 --> 01:15:57.453
First of all, the correct
question is when am I?

01:15:57.504 --> 01:15:59.922
And the answer is 1888, London.

01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:02.715
I believe the east end.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.367
You are at the show?

01:16:04.418 --> 01:16:06.202
Yes, and I know what was in that envelope.

01:16:06.253 --> 01:16:07.887
A script. Z's original script.

01:16:07.971 --> 01:16:09.672
He mailed it to himself
and kept it at the theater.

01:16:09.723 --> 01:16:11.474
It's like a poor man's copyright.

01:16:11.541 --> 01:16:13.542
So they re-launched the show
based on his original script

01:16:13.594 --> 01:16:14.977
that they screwed up in the first place.

01:16:15.045 --> 01:16:16.562
