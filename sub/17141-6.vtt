00:05.005 --> 00:07.007
Hey, guys.
It's me, Miranda.

00:07.090 --> 00:11.804
So I, um, am a voice teacher
as well as a singer,

00:11.887 --> 00:14.097
and... A professional singer.

00:14.181 --> 00:18.185
So... [sighs] I don't have
any voice students right now,

00:18.268 --> 00:20.771
but I would like to get some, so...

00:20.854 --> 00:23.273
I'm going to give you a free voice lesson,

00:23.356 --> 00:27.235
when usually they cost a lot of money,
because they are not cheap.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.946
[fast-forwarding]

00:30.573 --> 00:35.327
[vocalizing]

00:35.410 --> 00:36.411
That's a scale.

00:36.494 --> 00:38.163
[fast-forwarding]

00:38.246 --> 00:43.711
<i>♪ Bumble bee</i>
<i>Bumble bee, bumble bee ♪</i>

00:44.712 --> 00:47.422
[inhales deeply]
So, that's a scale with a word.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.007
Once again, that is more advanced.

00:49.091 --> 00:50.718
[fast-forwarding]

00:52.427 --> 00:53.596
<i>-So--</i>
-[door opens]

00:53.679 --> 00:56.599
[scoffs] <i>My freaking uncle's here.</i>

00:56.682 --> 00:59.476
[Jim] Miranda! I know you're upset
we had to cancel <i>Annie,</i>

00:59.560 --> 01:02.062
but did you finish
the free voice lesson video yet?

01:02.145 --> 01:04.313
-Yes.
-[gasps] And?

01:04.397 --> 01:07.943
And it was a horrible idea.
It gives away all my singing secrets.

01:08.777 --> 01:12.280
Miranda, tutorial videos
are all the rage right now.

01:12.364 --> 01:15.117
This video is gonna be a hit.
[whispers] Trust me.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.369
[bicycle bell rings]

01:18.286 --> 01:19.454
Don't post it.

01:21.832 --> 01:24.960
[sighs heavily] Of course.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.632
[theme music playing]

01:32.384 --> 01:35.345
So then, he starts making noise
while I'm trying to film his stupid video

01:35.428 --> 01:36.805
that I didn't even wanna make
in the first place,

01:36.889 --> 01:38.056
and it was a total waste of time.

01:38.140 --> 01:41.393
And I stepped in an ice cube puddle
this morning with my socks on. [scoffs]

01:41.476 --> 01:43.395
I'm sorry, Miranda.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.022
I had no idea things were that bad.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.690
I know. [scoffs]

01:46.774 --> 01:49.026
Not to mention,
I should be more famouser by now!

01:49.735 --> 01:52.905
Uncle's Five Phase Plan
is taking way too long to get me famous.

01:52.988 --> 01:55.407
Well, maybe this will cheer you up.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.662
[humming]

02:05.709 --> 02:07.335
[whooshing]

02:08.252 --> 02:09.797
-[imitates fanfare]
-Patrick!

02:09.880 --> 02:12.090
-That's stealing!
-Sorry.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.258
Give me another one.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.468
I'm sorry. I'm just...

02:15.552 --> 02:18.722
I'm really nervous for my audition
at the magic club tomorrow,

02:18.806 --> 02:21.725
so I'm just practicing everywhere I can.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.476
-Magic club?
-Yeah.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.270
It's this group
of really prestigious magicians.

02:25.353 --> 02:26.939
And if I get in, I get all the perks.

02:27.022 --> 02:31.443
I'm talking, I get a certificate.
I get to pay dues.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.862
I should get into that thing.

02:33.946 --> 02:37.282
That way I can skip to the magician phase
and get famous faster.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.870
Okay, well, would you like me
to teach you some tricks?

02:41.954 --> 02:46.291
Okay, I'll come over later and we can
spend the whole day together doing magic.

02:47.835 --> 02:48.836
Okay.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.004
Okay, yeah.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.382
Yes, and, uh, then I will sign you up
for the next auditions,

02:54.466 --> 02:55.843
which are in like six months,

02:55.926 --> 02:58.053
which gives us plenty of time to rehearse.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.931
Six months?
That's like a year.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.557
[groans]

03:09.647 --> 03:11.399
Well, why... [clears throat]

03:14.319 --> 03:16.154
Why don't you just take my place?

03:17.614 --> 03:18.949
Really?

03:20.575 --> 03:21.701
Yeah.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.288
I don't mind waiting another six months...

03:26.206 --> 03:28.625
and you deserve it more than I do.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.587
I do, don't I? [slurps]

Oh.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.149
Home sweet home.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.319
Hmm.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.408
Uh-huh.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.076
[Miranda] Guess what, Uncle Jim.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.412
I'm skipping ahead
to the last phase of your little plan.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.705
You're not ready to become a magician yet.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.666
I haven't gotten you a wand or anything.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.626
Patrick's gonna teach me.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.086
Patrick? [chuckles]

04:13.170 --> 04:15.297
Patrick is gonna teach you about magic?

04:15.380 --> 04:19.134
What does a popsicle salesman
know about magic?

04:19.216 --> 04:21.678
Well, you're taking way too freaking long
to make me famous.

04:21.762 --> 04:25.849
Miranda, my Five Phase Plan
has been scientifically formulated.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.561
You can't just go skipping willy-nilly
from phase to phase.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.229
That's not how it works.

04:31.313 --> 04:34.942
-Let's do... the free voice lesson video.
-No, too late!

04:35.025 --> 04:37.778
Patrick already got me an audition
at a big magic club tomorrow.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.362
Magic club?

04:39.446 --> 04:41.907
There's such a thing in the world
as a magic club?

04:41.990 --> 04:43.575
Mmm-hmm.

04:43.658 --> 04:47.329
That sounds suspicious.
No, I'm not going to allow you to go.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.039
What? Yeah, right.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.959
-[sighs]
-Okay.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.336
-Now that that's settled...
-Oh, no.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.213
-No.
-[Jim] Ah, perfect.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.505
No, Jim, what're you doing?

04:57.589 --> 05:01.093
Well, I can't live in my room.
My toilet is overflowed with poop.

05:01.176 --> 05:04.512
But... we all live in the living room.
All of us.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.556
Don't worry.
I'll be outta here before you know it.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.767
All I have to do is rip out the floors,
tear down the walls in my room,

05:09.852 --> 05:14.564
redo the plumbing with a longer pipe,
rewire the circuitry and boil everything.

05:15.607 --> 05:16.774
Oh, and paint.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.610
You won't have any privacy.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.113
Well, I appreciate your concern
about my private area, Bethany, and...

05:21.196 --> 05:24.407
[takes deep breath] I will come up
with a plan to make my private area...

05:24.491 --> 05:25.533
less exposed.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.745
[gasps] Ooh, sticks and cheese!

05:28.829 --> 05:30.247
-No, no, no.
-Mom.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.082
Well, these are for Emily.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.791
Emily?
Are you serious?

05:33.876 --> 05:35.418
-Excuse me.
-Oh.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.964
Why does everyone
keep taking away my snacks today?

05:39.839 --> 05:41.341
-Huh.
-Jim!

05:41.424 --> 05:42.467
[stapler clicking]

05:42.550 --> 05:44.011
When I said you wouldn't have any privacy,

05:44.094 --> 05:46.304
I didn't mean stapling a sheet
to the ceiling.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.891
Now you're just gonna have to find
a private place that's less public.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.393
Bethany, I have a lot
on my plate right now.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.769
I am building a new bedroom.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.647
I am trying to get Miranda
to upload a new video.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.441
I am working on my Five Phase Plan poster.

05:58.525 --> 06:02.237
And not to mention that I have to
investigate a suspicious magic club.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.823
But, sure, I'll squeeze a move
in there for you, Bethany.

06:05.908 --> 06:08.201
Thank you.
I'd appreciate that.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.206
That magic club is not suspicious.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.541
Oh, and by the way...

06:14.624 --> 06:17.252
I'm gonna become a magician
no matter what you say.

06:17.335 --> 06:20.130
Oh, no, you're not,
because I am in charge.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.340
Are you?

06:26.303 --> 06:29.139
[takes deep breath] Yes, I am.

06:29.932 --> 06:34.227
Emily, I thought you might be hungry,
so I made you some snacks.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.813
Honey, you haven't eaten anything.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.774
Strangely enough,
none of it seemed appetizing.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.777
Well... what if I add
a little bit of ketchup?

06:42.860 --> 06:44.779
You love ketchup.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.240
Ooh!

06:48.200 --> 06:49.451
Honey?

06:49.534 --> 06:51.078
Oh, honey.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.289
You can't just stay in here
and paint every day.

06:54.372 --> 06:57.625
I don't understand why you
won't come inside and talk to us.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.841
You wanna talk?
Okay.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.135
My only friend
thinks I'm a liar and a loser.

07:07.219 --> 07:08.886
And now everyone at school
knows the one thing

07:08.971 --> 07:11.431
I've been trying to keep a secret
my entire life.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.100
[sighs]

07:13.183 --> 07:16.019
Oh, sweetie. [sighs]

07:16.103 --> 07:18.646
I know, as a mother...

07:19.606 --> 07:22.150
there are some things
that I could say to you

07:22.234 --> 07:24.194
that would make you feel better.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.949
I'm listening.

07:31.368 --> 07:34.287
Oh! You want me to say them now?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.081
Uh...

07:37.249 --> 07:38.250
You...

07:39.209 --> 07:41.711
What do you think I should say to you?

07:43.921 --> 07:48.676
So, you want me to tell you
what to tell me to make me feel better?

07:48.760 --> 07:52.139
Well, see, now you're just...
being confusing. [chuckles]

07:54.224 --> 07:56.726
Okay. Thanks for the ketchup, Mom.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.398
I also have some soy sauce packets.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.109
And some lefts...
Like, some other stuff.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.780
So watch my... position here.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.497
Here, you try.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.333
Okay. Well, now you see it...

08:21.501 --> 08:22.960
What the heck?
It didn't disappear.

08:23.045 --> 08:24.587
Here, maybe if I help you...

08:24.671 --> 08:26.048
Maybe I can...

08:34.306 --> 08:35.640
You smell like lettuce.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.601
-[clears throat]
-What are you doing here?

08:38.684 --> 08:41.395
I just came by to let you know
that I decided to green light

08:41.479 --> 08:45.775
this whole "skipping ahead
to phase five magic" idea.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.485
So... [clears throat]
we're good to go.

08:47.569 --> 08:51.614
You can just come home with me,
and I'll teach you some magic. Please.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.200
No, Uncle Jim, we're fine.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.327
All right, that's great.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.371
Patrick! Come...
Can I talk to you over here?

08:58.455 --> 09:01.374
Over here, Patrick.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.255
[whispering] Listen, okay?

09:07.339 --> 09:10.342
Let me give you a piece of advice, pal.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.844
I've been working with Miranda
a long time.

09:12.927 --> 09:17.099
And you may think it's cute
to swoop in and try to take over,

09:17.182 --> 09:19.184
but let me tell you something.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.520
You are in way over your head.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.024
But don't worry... [chuckles]
'cause I'll be here...

09:27.817 --> 09:31.113
to pick up the pieces... as per ushe.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.492
Now it's time for me to disappear.

09:42.290 --> 09:46.002
You know, Miranda, maybe...
maybe if I teach you a simpler trick.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.713
[groans]
I want you to teach me real magic.

09:48.796 --> 09:52.175
Oh, well, there isn't actual magic.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.468
Magic isn't real.

09:54.886 --> 09:55.887
It's not?

10:00.767 --> 10:03.270
Uh... no, it...

10:03.353 --> 10:04.812
it is.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.231
There's real magic.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.025
It just...
[stammering] It isn't this stuff.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.902
This is just card tricks.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.820
Real magic...

10:14.239 --> 10:17.242
It's... [sighs]
making a connection with someone.

10:17.325 --> 10:22.205
Or, uh... seeing the love of your life
walk across the room.

10:23.873 --> 10:28.253
Hearing... angels sing
in the voice of the girl next door.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.342
That doesn't sound like real magic at all.

10:34.426 --> 10:37.094
[scoffs] Patrick, I'm kind of offended
that you're trying to teach me

10:37.179 --> 10:39.096
these little dinky, stupid magic tricks.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.266
If I'm gonna do magic, it needs to be big.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.311
Bigger, right.

10:46.688 --> 10:47.689
Big?

10:49.106 --> 10:50.192
Yeah.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.402
Yes! Uh, yes, of course.

10:52.485 --> 10:56.323
[stammers] You can be a stage magician.
And I can be your assistant.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.783
Mmm, sounds good to me.
[chuckles]

10:58.866 --> 11:00.368
[stammering]
And we can do a big finale.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.954
Uh, uh, and we'll figure out a routine,
and then...

11:03.037 --> 11:04.706
then this.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.375
You usher me into this box.

11:07.459 --> 11:10.545
-And you're gonna take swords...
-Ooh.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.172
...and you're gonna put them
through these slots here.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.841
-Okay, right now?
-No, not right now. Please, not right now.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.926
Uh, and then you take them out,

11:17.009 --> 11:19.971
and I will exit the box
completely uninjured.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.433
So this box is actually magic?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.352
Uh, no. No, I just...

11:27.520 --> 11:29.397
Yes, this box is magic.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.359
[sighs] That's incredible.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.693
Yeah.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.654
But you might wanna learn
some sword flourishes.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.072
Just, uh... [whooshes]

11:38.155 --> 11:39.949
sword flourish.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.743
[Miranda] Mmm.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.411
Okay.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.622
So just a little flourish.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.998

24:16.955 --> 24:19.583
when we're not in a box
getting stabbed with swords?

24:19.667 --> 24:22.169
[Miranda] Is he okay? Let's find out.

24:22.253 --> 24:23.379
[grunts]

24:24.296 --> 24:25.964
Not a trace of blood.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.217
Yes!

24:28.300 --> 24:29.968
I did it.

24:30.927 --> 24:31.928
[groans]

24:34.181 --> 24:36.142
The last one.

24:36.225 --> 24:37.768
[exhales heavily]

24:38.810 --> 24:40.521
Ta-da!

24:42.398 --> 24:43.857
[clears throat]

24:45.067 --> 24:47.111
Um, excuse me? [scoffs]

24:47.194 --> 24:48.195
I just bowed.

24:48.279 --> 24:50.197
That means you're supposed to applaud.

24:51.615 --> 24:54.368
Hello?
Are your ears working?

24:55.619 --> 24:56.995
[scoffs]

24:57.079 --> 24:59.040
Do your eyeballs not work, everyone?

24:59.123 --> 25:01.042
Hello? Did you not see
what just happened?

25:01.125 --> 25:03.710
This is a freaking real magic box!

25:05.046 --> 25:06.380
Nothing?

25:06.463 --> 25:09.800
[sighs] Oh, you think
you're so much better than me.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.678
With your little card tricks,
and your little scarves,

25:12.761 --> 25:14.221
and your little stupid doves.

25:14.305 --> 25:15.847
-She's going off script.
-What is happening?

25:15.931 --> 25:17.057
[Miranda] I hope they poop in your jacket!

25:17.141 --> 25:19.810
'Cause I know they're in there.
'Cause all of your magic is fake!

25:19.893 --> 25:23.021
But this, this is real magic!

25:23.105 --> 25:26.317
Can you stab a freaking person
in the freaking heart?

25:26.400 --> 25:28.110
[Patrick and Bethany scream]

25:45.336 --> 25:47.879
Okay, I need to start over.
This box is broken.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.007
[sirens wailing]

25:52.968 --> 25:54.720
[Jim] Emily, you're out of the garage.

25:54.803 --> 25:55.929
Bethany couldn't get you out,

25:56.012 --> 25:58.515
but one little talk
with Uncle Jim is all it takes.

25:58.599 --> 26:02.269
Hey, you weren't invited to Miranda's
big magic show audition, were you?

26:02.353 --> 26:03.895
What?

26:03.979 --> 26:06.940
Well, the reason I'm asking
is because I was told that I couldn't go,

26:07.023 --> 26:09.485
and then I find out
that Bethany was there?

26:09.568 --> 26:12.363
I don't know. I just find it
very hurtful and confusing

26:12.446 --> 26:13.530
that I wasn't invited.

26:13.614 --> 26:16.408
And not only that, they didn't
invite me to the hospital after.

26:16.492 --> 26:19.661
They just had some total rando
from the ER do it.

26:19.745 --> 26:20.787
Wait.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.498
What about the ER?

26:22.581 --> 26:26.793
Oh, um, I guess, uh,
Patrick and your mother got stabbed...

26:26.877 --> 26:29.004
in a... in a magic trick?

26:29.087 --> 26:31.798
Or... they stabbed each other in a...

26:31.882 --> 26:33.550
I don't know.
I didn't write it down.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.177
I should've written it down.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.015
What?

26:43.394 --> 26:44.478
Miranda.

26:45.812 --> 26:46.855
Hey, Patrick.

26:47.981 --> 26:49.065
You look tired.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.527
Oh, a little.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.530
-It must be from all the dancing.
-Yeah.

26:54.613 --> 26:59.785
Mmm. Doctors say it's 'cause I lost 10%
of my total blood volume on the way here.

26:59.868 --> 27:03.164
But I agree.
It's probably the dancing.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.000
Hey! There they are.

27:07.083 --> 27:09.461
-So, big performance today, huh?
-[Patrick sighs]

27:09.545 --> 27:12.798
I wasn't invited,
so I was wondering how it went.

27:12.881 --> 27:15.426
Oh, Patrick got stabbed.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.846
A stabbing. Well, that is not ideal,
but Miranda, this is what happens

27:19.930 --> 27:23.600
when you try to learn magic
from a magician and not a manager.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.353
What? I mean,
it wasn't anyone's fault, really.

27:26.437 --> 27:29.690
Well, if you look around the room,
only one of us got stabbed, Patrick.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.983
He's got a good point.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.445
-[Jim] But hang in there.
-[groaning softly]

27:35.362 --> 27:37.531
[Jim] I missed you. [chuckles]
[Miranda] I missed you. Jinx.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.659
[chuckles] I didn't say it just because
we were saying at the same time.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.161
I wasn't saying it because
I saw your mouth moving,

27:43.245 --> 27:45.581
and then I jumped in there and said it.
I really meant it.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.917
I missed you. I mean it.
I missed you.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.796
I... missed you so much, Miranda.

27:52.879 --> 27:55.048
I missed you a real lot more.

27:56.217 --> 27:57.676
Patrick, thank you.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.387
Thank you for bringing us together.

28:01.638 --> 28:02.764
Ow...

28:02.848 --> 28:03.890
Yes, "Ow."

28:04.725 --> 28:06.142
It hurt being away.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.190
How you feeling?

28:13.108 --> 28:15.068
-Okay.
-Yeah? Still in pain?

28:15.151 --> 28:16.612
Yeah.

28:16.695 --> 28:21.199
I mean, but I have fibromyalgia, so...
that's kind of a way of life for me.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.329
Okay. Uh, good news.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.706
There's no internal damage
from your stab wound.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.333
[sighs]

28:29.416 --> 28:34.045
However, there was an abnormality on
one of your kidneys from your ultrasound.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.547
So we're gonna run a few more tests.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.424
Abnormality? I...

28:38.342 --> 28:39.343
What does that mean?

28:39.426 --> 28:40.886
Well, we have some concerns.

28:40.969 --> 28:44.598
But, uh, let's get the results back
and see if we can't rule out a few things.

28:46.975 --> 28:48.143
I'll be in touch.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.272
Okay. Sure.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.152
[sighs]

28:57.236 --> 28:58.820
Mom?

29:00.489 --> 29:01.990
Emily.

29:03.367 --> 29:04.493
Are you okay?

29:07.203 --> 29:10.165
Yes. Yes.
I'm totally fine.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.669
It was just a few stitches. So...

29:13.752 --> 29:14.753
Okay.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.798
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

29:20.634 --> 29:22.344
I'm better now.

29:23.845 --> 29:24.971
Good.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.936
I was stabbed.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.028
Oh, hey.
You still here?

29:40.111 --> 29:42.448
Do you want to go sit in the waiting room?
It's much more comfortable.

29:45.075 --> 29:47.744
No... I wanna stay with Patrick.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.669
[Patrick sighs]
