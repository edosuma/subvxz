The burritos...
...are out of control, Baby Jack!

00:27.761 --> 00:30.764
We should've
listened to that donkey.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.535
There's only one way
to deal with burritos.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.237
Eat 'em!

00:47.248 --> 00:49.083
Love it. Classic.

00:49.117 --> 00:52.620
Babies vs Dogs is such
an awesome show, yo.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.088
It is the fun!

00:54.122 --> 00:55.856
It's hysterical.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.291
It's inventive.

00:57.325 --> 00:58.759
It's garbage!

00:58.792 --> 00:59.960
Control Freak?

00:59.993 --> 01:03.597
What's the meaning of this,
you sanctimonious sofa spud?

01:03.631 --> 01:06.100
Well, you were praising
something that I find atrocious.

01:06.134 --> 01:09.803
So, I'm here to ruin your enjoyment
of it by pointing out its flaws.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.272
No!

01:11.305 --> 01:12.706
The colors are so bright,

01:12.740 --> 01:15.243
it's like a rainbow puked
all over the screen.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.177
Come on!

01:16.210 --> 01:17.845
They're supposed to be heroes

01:17.878 --> 01:19.280
but all they do is tell jokes!

01:20.681 --> 01:21.815
Well, like you're an authority...

01:21.849 --> 01:23.251
And speaking of jokes,

01:23.284 --> 01:26.287
the humor is random
and not funny at all.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.158
What?

01:30.191 --> 01:31.825
I feel bad for kids today.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.662
Superhero cartoons used to be
so much better.

01:34.695 --> 01:38.599
They had everything.
Action, adventure, drama.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.635
Actually, those old superhero
cartoons were terrible.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.705
People only watched them because
there was nothing else on TV.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.840
You Philistines!

01:46.874 --> 01:49.277
I won't waste my breath
explaining to you

01:49.310 --> 01:52.146
why classic superhero
cartoons are superior.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.181
I'll show you.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.785
Make way for the Teen Titans.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.654
A quintet of triumphant
teenage talent.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.756
Robin, boy wonder

02:02.790 --> 02:04.792
with a multitude
of glorious gadgets.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.363
Cyborg, a mighty mixture
of machine and man.

02:09.397 --> 02:12.233
Raven, a mystical magician.

02:12.266 --> 02:16.570
Beast Boy, the missing link between man and beast.

02:16.604 --> 02:21.642
And Starfire, fast and strong
alien warrior princess.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.912
A fearless fivesome
fighting crime in their prime.

02:24.945 --> 02:27.881
They are the Teen Titans. Go!

02:31.852 --> 02:34.322
We're in the tower
but it's been altered.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.956
Holy hard drives, so have we.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.192
Our heads are proportional
to our bodies now.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.894
But I can only
move my head and arms.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.364
Only the eyes and the mouth
are doing the movements.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.366
Suffering servos, me too.

02:45.399 --> 02:48.469
Why do you keep saying stuff
like "suffering servos," Cyborg?

02:48.502 --> 02:51.405
I don't know, I'm trying to
say other stuff but I can't.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.374
Galloping gigawatts.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.576
Flying fiber optics.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.449
Our appearance, movement, and
speech have all been altered.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.551
Ooh, lookin' good.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.453
Like real superheroes.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.256
What have you done to us,
you wretched rapscallion?

03:08.289 --> 03:11.825
I've put you in the very first
Teen Titans cartoon.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.694
When you clowns used to be good!

03:13.727 --> 03:16.230
If it's so good,
why can we barely move?

03:16.264 --> 03:18.599
Because the budgets
for old cartoons were so low,

03:18.632 --> 03:20.901
they didn't have the money
for fancy animation.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.371
It has a certain charm, don't you think?

03:23.404 --> 03:25.706
I can only
turn into one animal, yo.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.245
Release us or suffer
the consequences.

03:31.279 --> 03:35.549
Not until you've learned to appreciate
the quality of this classic cartoon.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.385
Enjoy your adventure, Titans.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.354
I think this is going to be
your best episode to date.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.655
Freak out.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.991
Curses! We must
escape this place.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.926
I wish to move more
of the body parts.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.428
Me, too.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.530
I'm sick of just turning
my head side to side.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.831
You heard Control Freak.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.801
Our only escape is to
play out this adventure.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.869
But how will we know when
the adventure is to begin?

03:57.405 --> 03:59.307
Suddenly Titans Tower
finds itself under attack

03:59.340 --> 04:00.908
by strange flying beasts.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.546
Shivering shock absorbers,

04:05.579 --> 04:07.348
we're under attack by dinosaurs!

04:07.381 --> 04:09.817
And I thought things couldn't
get any worse.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.251
Don't worry, gang.

04:11.285 --> 04:14.722
A stun Birdarang will bring these
overgrown pigeons down to Earth.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.731
Looks like they're headed to a
mysterious island in unchartered waters.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.799
Let's follow them
in the T-Jet, gang.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.302
And so the Teen Titans find themselves

04:28.336 --> 04:31.839
en route to a mysterious island
in search of the robot dinosaurs.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.073
Hey, who said that?

04:33.106 --> 04:33.907
That's the narrator.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.009
He explains things
to the audience.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.979
Dancing diodes, isn't that
just lazy storytelling?

04:39.012 --> 04:41.349
The narrator
took offense at this comment.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.351
It is not lazy storytelling.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.652
He is setting the mood.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.654
Nah, you's bein' lazy.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.556
Every writer knows you are
supposed to do the showing

04:48.589 --> 04:50.391
and not the telling.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.393
How do you show
with a limited budget?

04:52.426 --> 04:54.495
These stories would make no
sense if I weren't here,

04:54.528 --> 04:55.529
explaining everything.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.030
I am not the problem.

04:57.064 --> 05:00.334
I am the glue
holding everything together.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.935
The narrator stopped
defending himself

05:01.969 --> 05:05.005
because the Titans had arrived
at the mysterious island.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.544
Golly, gosh, gee,
gosh, gosh, gosh, gee.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.513
This island is the big.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.415
We still need to
find those dinosaurs.

05:14.448 --> 05:17.351
I'll used my dinosaur
tracking Birdarang.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.719
You have one of those?

05:18.752 --> 05:19.853
Of course.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.623
Wow, everything is really
convenient in this story.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.794
It's that way.

05:29.397 --> 05:33.701
And so, the Titans find
themselves at the lair of the dinosaurs.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.470
How would you know that
if I didn't tell you, hmm?

05:36.504 --> 05:37.405
You're welcome.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.739
Be quiet, Titans.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.708
We need to remain undetected.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.510
The Titans
quietly entered the...

05:42.543 --> 05:44.812
- I said quiet!
- Sorry.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.951
And I thought things
couldn't get any worse.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.023
Welcome to your doom,
interlopers.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.791
You must be
the one-dimensional villain

05:57.825 --> 06:00.528
that will never be seen again
after this episode.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.062
I am Doctor Otto von Death,

06:02.095 --> 06:04.465
and I am anything
but one-dimensional.

06:04.498 --> 06:07.167
You see, I've created
a dinosaur army

06:07.200 --> 06:09.870
which I plan to launch
all over the world

06:09.903 --> 06:12.573
using my rocket.

06:12.606 --> 06:16.143
And like the asteroids that rained
down and wiped out the dinosaurs,

06:16.176 --> 06:21.081
so too will my dinosaur army rain
down and wipe out the human race.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.753
Sure doesn't get more
one-dimensional than that.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.522
I am not one-dimensional!

06:28.556 --> 06:32.025
Then tell us why you wants to destroy
the world with dinosaurs, yo.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.160
It's...

06:33.193 --> 06:34.662
Not easy to say exactly.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.731
I grew up a strange boy
not like the rest.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.167
It wasn't easy.
I wanted a normal life.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.471
Went to college, got
married, had kids, you know.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.774
But these days, my wife is always on
my case about something or the other.

06:46.807 --> 06:50.143
My daughter moved to
Colorado with her boyfriend.

06:50.177 --> 06:53.447
Said she couldn't live another day in my house.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.983
My son isn't working
or going to school.

06:56.016 --> 06:59.653
He just sits in his room
on the computer all day.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.489
I don't even know
what he's doing in there.

07:01.522 --> 07:05.626
On top of all this, I was turned
down for term life insurance

07:05.659 --> 07:06.794
because of my high cholesterol.

07:06.827 --> 07:10.464
So, I suppose all of this
end of the human race stuff

07:10.498 --> 07:15.068
is really just a reflection of my
desire to put an end to my own misery.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.672
Bubbling backstory.
That's some depth.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.207
Oh, give me a break, Otto.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.477
So life dealt you a crummy hand.
Get over it.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.012
Now you sound like my wife.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.648
It's time I put an end
to you pests.

07:34.722 --> 07:37.157
Now, to launch
my dinosaur rocket

07:37.190 --> 07:39.560
and destroy the world!

07:43.597 --> 07:45.198
Oh, no.

07:45.232 --> 07:48.636
How are the Teen Titans going to
get themselves out of this one?

07:48.669 --> 07:49.770
Shall we the go?

07:52.172 --> 07:53.240
Oh, right.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.776
The heroes always escape
these death traps.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.978
We've got a world to save.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.213
Titans, go!

08:00.247 --> 08:01.582
Stop right there.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.084
Ah, the Teen Titans?

08:04.117 --> 08:06.654
We are putting an end
to this experiment.

08:06.687 --> 08:10.057
Not if my T-rex
puts an end to you first.

08:15.529 --> 08:19.299
Oh, oh, oh! It looks like we're
headed for an epic climax!

08:19.332 --> 08:20.801
Let's do it, Titans!

08:22.235 --> 08:25.205
An ice Birdarang
should down this dino!

08:27.641 --> 08:30.578
A fire Birdarang
should down this dino!

08:33.113 --> 08:35.683
An electric Birdarang
should down this dino!

08:38.251 --> 08:41.154
- An...
- Ah! Enough with the Birdarangs already.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.222
My turn.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.697
- Is that all?
- I gots this.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.732
Time for the big guns, yo.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.033
Here we go!

08:56.804 --> 08:59.907
Oh, I was hoping you would turn
into something more impressive.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.542
- I shall destroy the dinosaur!
- Ooh!

09:07.380 --> 09:09.650
Ah! This is so disappointing.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.586
You were right, Titans.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.756
These old superhero cartoons
are hard to watch now.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.390
But on a positive note,

09:17.424 --> 09:20.628
it looks like that T-rex is going
to destroy you once and for all!

09:22.730 --> 09:23.797
Think again.

09:29.637 --> 09:30.771
What?

09:30.804 --> 09:32.272
Go get'em, boys.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.625
I used to think the character
design of those babies was stupid.

09:51.659 --> 09:55.929
But now I realize their simplicity
enables them to be much more expressive!

09:55.963 --> 09:57.798
Ow, ow, ow.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.037
The animation on those dogs
is very interesting.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.860
Let's get out of here, gang.

10:32.833 --> 10:33.967
We did it, team.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.703
- Yeah!
- Woof, woof!

10:38.739 --> 10:39.907
We's back, yo.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.176
I learned something
today, Titans.

10:43.210 --> 10:46.680
Not everything old is good.
Not everything new is bad.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.381
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We get it.

10:48.415 --> 10:52.285
Now back to Babies
vs Dogs all day marathon!
