01:38.932 --> 01:44.061
People have to realize, we cannot
make everybody totally safe,

01:44.062 --> 01:48.024
even if we allocated the entire
federal budget towards security.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.693
I promise you there is
not an easier job...

01:51.737 --> 01:56.192
in the whole federal government than
riding first class in airplanes from...

02:00.120 --> 02:01.370
Yeah.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.244
I know. I'm sorry.

02:03.874 --> 02:07.251
No, no, you can trust me. I'm fine.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.501
What? I can't hear you.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.674
I can't hear you!

02:37.658 --> 02:39.610
Hey, man, you got a light?

02:40.202 --> 02:42.120
Sir. Excuse me.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.914
Excuse me, sir. You got a light?

02:44.915 --> 02:46.537
Yeah. Sorry.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.456
May I have your attention, please?

02:53.882 --> 02:55.925
So, where you off to?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.183
Where you headed?

03:09.439 --> 03:11.607
I'm headed to Amsterdam.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.735
May I have your attention, please?

03:14.736 --> 03:17.196
The white zone is for
the immediate loading

03:17.197 --> 03:19.741
and unloading of passengers only.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.540
Here you go, sir.
Enjoy your flight.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.542
Everyone and their mother's
in the game right now.

03:29.543 --> 03:33.462
You got Korean phones, Japanese
phones, Scandinavian phones.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.837
OS is trying to keep up with the hardware
from 15 different manufacturers.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.714
Right!

03:38.969 --> 03:42.012
That's what I've been saying.
No one listens to me!

03:42.013 --> 03:46.684
Dude, you're preaching to the choir!
It makes absolutely no sense.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.973
Really? I guess I'm in your way.

03:51.398 --> 03:54.226
New Yorkers, man, I swear to God.
Give me two minutes.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.279
Clear.

04:05.704 --> 04:06.996
Right this way, sir. Please.

04:06.997 --> 04:11.667
Listen to me. Listen to me. I cannot
stay in London for three days.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.495
Get me on the next flight back.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.755
Please, look. This is...

04:16.757 --> 04:19.005
This is a bad time for...

04:20.844 --> 04:24.719
"You have to do what you have to
do." Well, guess what? So do I.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.567
Here.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.198
Long flights are the worst.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.571
No, thanks.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.171
Hi, baby.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.087
Good evening, passengers.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.727
There's a mix-up
with my reservation.

05:11.728 --> 05:15.057
I was supposed to have a window
seat and they put me in an aisle.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.857
Maybe you could move
some people around,

05:16.858 --> 05:18.150
'cause I was guaranteed
the window seat.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.672
I'm sorry about that, Ms. Summers.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.997
At this time we are inviting
passengers with small children,

05:31.998 --> 05:34.621
or who require assistance,
to board at this time.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.217
Once again, in the boarding area,

05:43.218 --> 05:46.387
we are ready to begin our priority
boarding Flight 10 to London.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.264
We'll begin general boarding
in just a few minutes.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.640
Are you all set to board?

05:49.641 --> 05:50.933
So we have to go on the runway?

05:50.934 --> 05:52.643
Come on, sweetheart.
Is this everything?

05:52.644 --> 05:54.812
Yeah. My mom checked
my big bag for me.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.689
Have you flown by yourself before?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.642
No. This is my first time.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.437
You're gonna have a lovely time.

06:01.862 --> 06:05.531
Welcome aboard. Yes, just through
there and down to the left.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.242
Nancy, this is Becca. It's her
first time on an airplane.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.661
Wonderful. Who's waiting
for you in London?

06:10.662 --> 06:11.871
My dad.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.495
Well, we've a seat by the
window all picked out for you.

06:22.716 --> 06:27.342
Look, I know it may seem scary,
but flying's really quite fun.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.762
I believe this little
guy made a run for it.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.177
What's his name?

06:34.769 --> 06:36.145
Henry.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.856
Yeah, he looks like a Henry.
That's a good name.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.604
- Well...
- Becca.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.861
Becca, I think Henry's
a little scared.

06:43.862 --> 06:46.906
Maybe you can show
him how it's done.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.111
Good girl.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.925
I'm sorry, am I in your way?

07:10.055 --> 07:11.472
Again?

07:12.390 --> 07:14.092
We are right up here.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.435
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.521
As a reminder, all carry-on luggage
must fit in the overhead bin

07:19.522 --> 07:22.521
or be safely stowed under
the seat in front of you.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.860
If you're having trouble
fitting your luggage,

07:24.861 --> 07:26.734
we'll be happy to check it for you.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.742
Thank you for choosing British
Aqualantic. Enjoy the flight.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.535
Do you know, is there
somebody sitting there?

07:33.536 --> 07:35.371
- Do you know who has that seat?
- No, sorry.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.290
Is somebody sitting here?

07:37.832 --> 07:41.210
Hey, I'm on the plane. And guess what?
They effed up my reservation.

07:41.211 --> 07:44.088
We land at 7:35.
Did they book a car?

07:44.089 --> 07:45.172
Hang on. Hang on.

07:45.173 --> 07:49.426
Excuse me. Sir? I'm here in 3B.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.886
I was wondering if maybe
you'd switch seats

07:50.887 --> 07:52.304
with me so I could have the window?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.889
Do you care?

07:53.890 --> 07:56.593
Do you speak English?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.978
Okay. Thank you.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.228
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sir?

08:02.565 --> 08:04.817
Hi. I'm right here, I'm in 3B

08:04.818 --> 08:07.569
and I was just wondering if maybe
you would prefer the aisle,

08:07.570 --> 08:09.738
or if you don't care, if you would

08:09.739 --> 08:11.240
switch with me for the window seat?

08:11.241 --> 08:15.617
A lot of people just sleep
anyway, so I was wondering if...

08:20.583 --> 08:22.126
Sure. Why not?

08:22.127 --> 08:25.297
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate that.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.715
Sorry, let me get out of your way.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.213
Let me help you.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.714
There's room right up here.

08:37.475 --> 08:40.727
Aqualantic is pleased to offer
extensive in-flight entertainment

08:40.729 --> 08:43.272
with hundreds of video and music
programming at your fingertips.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.066
Oh, God.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.109
Hello? Are you there?

08:47.110 --> 08:48.193
Your phone.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.278
- What?
- Hello?

08:49.279 --> 08:50.446
- Your phone.
- Oh, shit.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.905
- Hello?
- Hi. Hi, hi.

08:51.906 --> 08:55.326
I'll call you when we land, okay?
All right, bye.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.618
Rough day, huh?

08:56.619 --> 08:58.120
Yeah, you have no idea.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.705
Hi, excuse me.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.623
Could I get a gin and tonic,
when you get a chance?

09:01.624 --> 09:04.373
- Of course.
- Make that two, please.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.753
God.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.138
- Nancy, right? Gwen.
- Yeah.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.264
Thank God for you.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.891
Girl doesn't show up and leaves me

09:18.892 --> 09:20.476
to handle two cabins.
You're a lifesaver.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.978
If I pass out, just promise to
catch me before I hit the floor.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.726
Not if I do first.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.483
Can I get you gentlemen
anything before we taxi?

09:27.484 --> 09:29.652
No, thanks, Nance, I'm fine.

09:36.826 --> 09:37.910
What?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.328
Nothing.

09:39.329 --> 09:43.373
Ground, this is AQ-10, we're ready
to disconnect ground power.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.576
You naughty boy.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.879
Naughty.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.223
Thank you.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.852
Didn't you order gin and tonic?

10:03.853 --> 10:05.020
Did I?

10:05.021 --> 10:06.894
'Cause she brought you a water.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.147
It's not my lucky day.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.425
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

10:35.426 --> 10:39.721
welcome aboard British Aqualantic
Flight 10, non-stop service to London.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.723
I'm your captain, David McMillan,

10:41.724 --> 10:43.600
flying with First
Officer Kyle Rice.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.227
And we expect a smooth
ride this evening

10:45.228 --> 10:48.230
- with a flight time of just over six hours.
- Seatbelts, thank you.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.809
We should have you in
the air momentarily.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.610
This is a beautiful
picture they took of her.

10:53.611 --> 10:57.031
Sir, could you move your
seat-back forward? Thank you.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.281
Flight attendants, please
be seated for takeoff.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.164
What's that for? Is that for luck?

11:05.165 --> 11:07.374
Something like that.
My daughter gave it to me.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.877
Better than a gin and tonic, I bet.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.170
It is.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.851
I'm Jen.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.719
Bill.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.939
- You fly much?
- All the time, actually.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.733
Yeah, I can tell.

11:34.944 --> 11:38.318
It's just the takeoff.
Once we're in the air, I'll...

11:43.328 --> 11:44.494
You'll have a seizure?

11:44.495 --> 11:45.912
I'll be fine. I promise.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.875
You actually fly all the time?

11:49.876 --> 11:52.704
Some things you never get used to.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.717
How old's your daughter?

12:03.306 --> 12:05.554
Now, she's, uh, 17.

12:05.767 --> 12:06.892
What's her name?

12:06.893 --> 12:08.185
Olivia.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.519
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.973
I like that name, it's a nice name.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.776
So, Why'd she give you the ribbon?

12:15.485 --> 12:20.822
Some kids have blankets, stuffed animals.
Olivia had ribbons.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.776
This was hers when she was little.

12:30.166 --> 12:35.463
She'd tie it to a finger or
toe before going to bed.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.839
And then in the morning,
she'd make me guess.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.966
- Where she put it?
- Yeah.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.759
That's cute. That's really cute.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.178
Yeah, and then she grew up.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.802
I suppose I need it
more than she did.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.973
Anyway.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.186
So, what do you do for a living?

12:56.359 --> 12:57.902
Well...

12:59.487 --> 13:00.570
I fly a lot.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.897
Oh. yeah?

13:01.906 --> 13:05.158
Yeah, but I think that

13:05.159 --> 13:07.494
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.496
- Get some sleep, sure.
- Yeah, it's gonna be a long flight.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.745
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sleep well.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.141
- Stop!
- Baby...

13:32.854 --> 13:36.815
- You're crazy!
- You're so hot, baby, I can't stop it! I can't!

13:36.816 --> 13:38.650
People are watching!

13:38.651 --> 13:42.321
No, no, no. Nobody's
watching. Nobody.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.617
Oh, my God.

13:47.035 --> 13:49.077
In front of my mom,
with no pants on

13:49.078 --> 13:51.079
and half a Toblerone in his mouth.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.907
He didn't.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.285
Do you know him?

18:21.642 --> 18:23.101
Excuse me.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.804
What kind of tea do you have?

18:25.688 --> 18:28.898
I'll have chamomile. Thanks.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.476
Certainly.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.412
- This your idea of a joke?
- What're you talking about?

19:24.413 --> 19:26.289
If you have a problem with
me, say it to my face.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.249
Don't play games on a
flight in a secure network.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.459
You need to calm down, partner.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.629
I was a cop for 25 years.
I knew men like you.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.005
Men like me?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.465
Men like me follow
goddamn protocol.

19:35.466 --> 19:36.883
We're not even supposed
to be talking right now.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.802
It's a secure network, Jack!

19:39.303 --> 19:41.143
Bill, what the hell are
you talking about?

19:44.433 --> 19:45.976
Don't deny you sent these.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.107
Bill, I didn't send these.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.400
See for yourself.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.456
Then someone on this flight is
threatening to kill a passenger

20:08.457 --> 20:13.712
unless $150 million is transferred
in the next 18 minutes.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.004
Who knows about this?

20:15.005 --> 20:16.377
You and me.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.347
I say no way. It's bullshit.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.683
Any threat to an aircraft
requires immediate landing.

20:26.684 --> 20:30.353
Right, yeah, all right.
If there is a threat.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.688
Come on, Bill.
You wanna be the agent

20:31.689 --> 20:32.981
who lands an international flight

20:32.982 --> 20:34.566
because some asshole knows
your personal problems?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.359
Sends you a couple of joke texts?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.820
Bill, I gotta ask you, how
many have you had today?

20:38.821 --> 20:40.447
A threat's a threat!

20:40.448 --> 20:41.573
Okay.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.783
You really need to think this
through, partner, all right?

20:43.784 --> 20:45.243
Listen, how do you
kill somebody aboard

20:45.244 --> 20:46.884
a crowded plane and
get away with it?

20:47.872 --> 20:50.165
Pretty hard to pull that
off, don't you think?

20:50.166 --> 20:55.213
Bill, if there's not a
situation, you don't create one.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.299
I'm going to see the captain.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.592
You keep your eye
on the main cabin.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.922
Bill? Don't panic
the cockpit. Bill?

21:10.394 --> 21:12.187
I tell you, it's five hours in

21:12.188 --> 21:15.267
and then, out of nowhere, he
suddenly sits up and he says...

21:24.450 --> 21:27.494
- How do we validate the threat?
- We can't.

21:27.495 --> 21:30.872
Captain? TSA says a full cross
check on the passenger manifest

21:30.873 --> 21:33.246
could take 25 to 30 minutes.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.672
We can divert the flight,
if this is for real.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.424
The nearest airport?

21:41.425 --> 21:43.426
Well, it's 95 minutes
back to Halifax,

21:43.427 --> 21:46.596
two hours to Iceland,
three to London.

21:46.597 --> 21:49.175
We're midway over the Atlantic.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.233
You Okay?

21:58.234 --> 22:02.029
It's this juice fast I'm on.
Gives me the shakes.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.863
It's your call, Bill.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.953
Do we have a situation?

22:14.041 --> 22:15.917
Can we review the footage?

22:15.918 --> 22:18.419
It's recorded directly
to the black box.

22:18.420 --> 22:21.005
But I can watch all the camera
feeds live from the galley?

22:21.006 --> 22:22.207
Yeah.

22:22.591 --> 22:23.925
Get back on the line with TSA.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.969
See if they can back trace
this account number.

22:25.970 --> 22:29.299
In the meantime, I'll need
the passenger manifest.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.921
I'll see if I can find him.

22:32.226 --> 22:35.520
But in 10 minutes, I'd like you
to switch off the network system.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.691
We don't want him checking to
see if a transfer's been made.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.310
Nancy, come with me.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.748
Two cameras in business,
six in coach.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.000
We're gonna need more eyes.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.293
I'll get another attendant.

22:58.294 --> 22:59.961
How well do you know the crew?

22:59.962 --> 23:01.835
Not very well.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.179
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

23:10.180 --> 23:12.382
Will you come with me, please?

23:15.144 --> 23:16.516
Now?

23:18.439 --> 23:19.856
You want me to come right now?

23:26.488 --> 23:27.822
This is a bad idea.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.449
She was sitting beside
me when this started.

23:29.450 --> 23:32.201
The only two people I trust on
this airplane are you and her.

23:32.202 --> 23:34.746
Trust me with what?
What's going on?

23:36.457 --> 23:38.666
I text, you circle any
passenger with a phone

23:38.667 --> 23:40.793
or acting like they have a phone.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.795
I'm not sure I understand what
it is you want me to do...

23:42.796 --> 23:44.669
Please, just do as I ask.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.380
Ladies and gentlemen, looks like

24:25.381 --> 24:26.589
we've hit some
unexpected turbulence.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.634
Please return to your seats and
keep your seatbelts fastened

24:29.635 --> 24:31.835
until it's safe to move about
the cabin. Thank you.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.453
There. 9B.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.841
Seat 9B. David Norton.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.825
22C.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.617
Austin Reilly.

25:53.177 --> 25:54.469
2F.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.429
Jason Cole.

25:59.683 --> 26:00.884
14C.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.311
14C, Charles Wheeler.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.024
13B.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.022
Fahim Nasir.

26:12.613 --> 26:13.696
5B.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.323
5B. Iris Marianne.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.321
You better answer it.

26:21.705 --> 26:22.952
Hello?

26:25.709 --> 26:27.286
Bill?

26:30.297 --> 26:31.999
Bill?

26:36.553 --> 26:37.887
- Who is this?
- This is Philip Marenick.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.890
I'm with TSA. I understand from
the captain you have a situation.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.183
I need to speak to my supervisor.

26:42.184 --> 26:44.352
Listen, I'm calling from
the DHS here in D.C.

26:44.353 --> 26:46.521
From here on out,
I am your supervisor.

26:46.522 --> 26:47.605
Now, Agent Marks, I need you...

26:47.606 --> 26:50.525
I'm going to run seat numbers by you.
I need red flags and priors.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.527
- That's a very serious request you put in.
- 20G.

26:52.528 --> 26:53.820
Agent Marks, I need you to take me

26:53.821 --> 26:55.029
through the events
from the beginning.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.989
And we're looking into tracing
the account number you gave us.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.074
20G again.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.516
And as you know, protocol
dictates in these situations...

27:00.953 --> 27:02.912
we corroborate everything with
the second officer on board.

27:02.913 --> 27:03.996
20G again.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.039
It's not him.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.709
It's not who? Look, I'd rather
not jump to any conclusions.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.545
Listen, Bill, I don't think
you're in a position to sort out

27:10.546 --> 27:12.373
who's a suspect or
not at this point.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.377
Agent Marks?

27:19.888 --> 27:21.089
Bill?

27:21.348 --> 27:23.975
Agent Marks, I need some sort
of acknowledgment from you.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.348
Bill?

27:26.061 --> 27:27.763
Agent Marks?

27:28.230 --> 27:29.438
Marks, you need to answer me.

27:29.439 --> 27:30.982
Hang on.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.243
Marks, are you there?

27:42.244 --> 27:43.991
Go back to your seat.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.001
You son-of-a-bitch!

27:50.002 --> 27:51.169
Keep your voice down.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.122
- Hand it over!
- What're you...

27:53.797 --> 27:56.591
Bill, look at me, okay?
I need this money.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.633
I can cut you in...

27:57.634 --> 27:59.093
- Give me the goddamn phone, Jack.
- Just listen to me.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.762
Give me the phone...

28:09.354 --> 28:11.189
Jack! You son-of-a-bitch.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.607
- Give it up, Marks.
- Stop it!

28:12.608 --> 28:14.060
- Give it up.
- Stop it.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.819
Damn it, Jack!

28:21.617 --> 28:23.660
Stop it. Stop it!

28:24.036 --> 28:25.704
Stop fighting!

28:33.170 --> 28:34.622
Jack!

28:51.563 --> 28:53.060
Don't do this, Jack.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.685
Stop it!

28:58.570 --> 28:59.737
Don't.

28:59.738 --> 29:00.863
Don't.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.862
Don't do this, Jack!

29:05.661 --> 29:06.987
Don't!

30:59.733 --> 31:01.859
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your captain speaking.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.277
I apologize for the
inconvenience...

31:03.278 --> 31:04.612
Shit.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.280
But our network is
down for the moment.

31:06.281 --> 31:08.824
If you just bear with us, we'll
attempt to restart the Internet.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.451
- Turn the network back on.
- What?

31:10.452 --> 31:11.952
The network, turn it on.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.996
We'll keep you posted.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.452
I need the network system back on.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.121
Go ahead, Nance.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.844
The account number you gave us.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.263
It's in your name.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.018
What?

31:36.019 --> 31:37.516
TSA just confirmed it.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.145
That doesn't make any sense.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.859
You know me.
You know I'd never do...

31:43.860 --> 31:45.733
I know, I know.

31:46.321 --> 31:49.695
Look, the 20 minutes are up.
Has anything happened?

31:54.454 --> 31:56.122
No.

31:56.123 --> 31:57.832
It's probably just a hoax.

31:57.833 --> 32:02.209
Some elaborate middle finger
to the airline industry.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.839
Excuse me. Are you waiting?

32:04.840 --> 32:06.674
No. Go ahead.

32:06.675 --> 32:07.925
Agent...

32:07.926 --> 32:09.469
Hi, ma'am.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.348
Agent Marenick, who you spoke with,

32:14.349 --> 32:17.435
will continue to handle the
investigation from D.C.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.519
David...

32:18.520 --> 32:21.815
And they've asked me to take
your badge and your gun.

32:22.691 --> 32:24.859
- No.
- Bill.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.232
- No.
- Bill...

32:27.446 --> 32:28.738
I don't have a choice here.

32:29.156 --> 32:30.778
I'm the air marshal.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.905
- Bill...
- Okay. Okay.

32:36.163 --> 32:38.706
Look, just sit back, relax,

32:38.707 --> 32:40.082
- and...
- Enjoy the flight.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.876
Enjoy the flight, yeah.

32:59.561 --> 33:01.395
Was it him? The guy in 20G?

33:01.396 --> 33:03.394
No, it was nothing.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.733
I dropped my stupid
phone in the sink.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.693
Oh, God, I do that all the time.

33:07.694 --> 33:10.029
I lost like five
phones in six months,

33:10.030 --> 33:12.281
and then I learned
this little trick.

33:12.282 --> 33:13.859
Here we go.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.529
So, should I be worried?

33:18.038 --> 33:19.455
No, not at all.

33:19.456 --> 33:21.784
It was a mistake to
involve you, I'm sorry.

33:21.875 --> 33:24.954
So, if it's not him, then
why do you have his phone?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.421
I have to be careful, even when

33:27.422 --> 33:28.756
there's nothing to
be concerned about.

33:28.757 --> 33:29.798
It's my job.

33:29.799 --> 33:33.424
As a passenger, don't I have the
right to know what's going on?

33:33.553 --> 33:36.263
- Listen... Jen, right?
- Yeah.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.808
It's an innocent prank.
Some kid with a cell phone.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.935
If it was on the ground,
I'd catch him

33:40.936 --> 33:42.728
in two seconds flat, but up here,

33:42.729 --> 33:45.105
traveling at 500 miles an hour,
I can't track his phone.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.190
There's nothing I can do.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.511
There's nothing you can do?
Aren't you an air marshal?

33:50.111 --> 33:51.403
Ma'am, please return to your seat.

33:51.404 --> 33:52.981
Did you just call me "ma'am"?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.449
Please return to your seat.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.992
Seriously? Did you call me "ma'am"?

33:56.993 --> 33:58.536
Now.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.530
Okay, Bill.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.373
I'm going.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.167
- Thank you.
- Ugh.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.875
Agent Hammond?

35:27.876 --> 35:29.578
Just a moment.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.312
Nancy.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.403
Sorry. The indicator
must be broken.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.447
I was looking for Agent Hammond.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.235
What's wrong?

36:13.213 --> 36:15.211
Nancy, wait. Wait!

36:16.716 --> 36:18.634
Nancy, please.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.302
Calm down, calm down.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.762
Calm down.

36:21.763 --> 36:24.057
Please, I can explain this.

36:24.391 --> 36:25.808
Okay?

36:29.771 --> 36:31.598
This is a setup.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.149
The captain just told
me that the account

36:34.150 --> 36:36.610
they want the money
wired to is in my name.

36:36.611 --> 36:39.564
Do you think I would
extort $150 million

36:39.781 --> 36:42.484
using an account in my own name?

36:42.492 --> 36:45.320
He was transporting cocaine, Nancy.

36:45.829 --> 36:48.539
Whoever we're looking
for knew that.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.493
He threatened Hammond,
made him paranoid.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.830
I found out, and Hammond
tried to kill me.

36:55.422 --> 36:58.924
The person who's doing this,
he wants it to look like this.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.675
Like two federal agents are
the ones doing this, not him.

37:03.930 --> 37:07.350
Jack pulled a gun on me.
I had no choice.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.520
Nancy?

37:12.355 --> 37:14.853
I had no choice.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.528
You know me.

37:19.946 --> 37:23.025
You know I could never
do something like this.

37:24.492 --> 37:25.818
Look at me.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.327
I need you to believe me.

37:37.172 --> 37:38.874
I believe you.

37:42.135 --> 37:45.384
In 13 minutes, someone else will
die, unless I find him first.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.384
I need you to help me.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.690
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?

37:56.691 --> 37:58.525
My name is Bill Marks.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.361
I'm the federal air marshal
assigned to this flight.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.655
I apologize for the disturbance.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.991
The TSA has recently
instituted a policy

38:05.992 --> 38:08.535
of random searches aboard
international flights.

38:08.536 --> 38:12.539
Unfortunately, this is one of
three lucky flights this month.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.374
I'm gonna be coming
through the cabin.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.293
If I call your name
and seat number,

38:16.294 --> 38:18.337
please stand up and
move into the aisle.

38:21.174 --> 38:24.343
If you're in possession of an
illegal substance, item or weapon,

38:24.344 --> 38:25.719
it's best to just step forward now.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.514
Captain, you might
want to hear this.

38:28.515 --> 38:31.892
I need everybody to place both
hands on the seat in front of you.

38:31.893 --> 38:34.187
What the hell is he doing?

38:34.729 --> 38:36.146
Right now!

38:36.147 --> 38:39.772
Contact TSA, tell them we
have a possible hijacking.

38:40.568 --> 38:44.113
- Nancy, what's going on?
- It's just a random search.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.151
Thank you.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.576
Excuse me.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.450
Jennifer Summers?

38:52.330 --> 38:54.414
Should I have told you
about the bomb in my bag?

38:54.415 --> 38:57.494
Let's not use that word
on a plane, please.

38:57.919 --> 39:00.712
When I move on to the main
cabin, you watch business class.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.214
If you see anything suspicious,

39:02.215 --> 39:03.674
anything at all, get my attention.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.217
- Scream, if you have to.
- Okay.

39:05.218 --> 39:07.219
American paranoia.

39:07.220 --> 39:10.390
Iris Marianne, 5B.
Stand up, please.

39:12.892 --> 39:16.141
Is that how older men
pick up younger women?

39:16.688 --> 39:18.438
Fondle first, talk later?

39:18.439 --> 39:19.982
Phone.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.819
Why don't you enter your number?

39:24.237 --> 39:26.117
You're a little young for me.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.792
Who does this guy think he is?

39:38.793 --> 39:41.337
It's all right. Just calm down!

39:42.130 --> 39:43.755
- Just married?
- Yesterday.

39:43.756 --> 39:45.632
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.967
Sit down.

39:46.968 --> 39:49.094
It's nothing to worry about.
Happens all the time.

39:49.095 --> 39:51.054
- 13B, Fahim Nasir.
- Bullshit.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.178
- Stand.
- Thank you, sir.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.315
Feeling okay?

40:01.316 --> 40:03.317
Flying is not my cup of tea.

40:03.318 --> 40:04.568
Tell me about it.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.445
- You're a doctor.
- How do you know?

40:06.446 --> 40:08.572
Your bag. Can you
fetch it up, please?

40:08.573 --> 40:10.867
Sure. It's right down here.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.332
What kind of doctor?

40:18.333 --> 40:19.666
Molecular neuroscience.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.710
Sounds interesting.

40:22.003 --> 40:24.421
Hey, look, man, some of us
need to get some sleep.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.624
Sir, sit down. Be quiet.

40:27.175 --> 40:30.049
14C, Charles Wheeler? Stand.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.175
There was nothing in his bag?

40:37.352 --> 40:38.894
What's the purpose of your trip?

40:38.895 --> 40:41.438
I have a client in Brighton.
I'm a bankruptcy attorney.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.482
Yeah? You any good?

40:43.691 --> 40:46.777
- Why? Oh, you need one?
- Sit down.

40:46.778 --> 40:51.404
Sir, you need to keep your hands on
the seat in front of you. Thank you.

40:52.825 --> 40:54.527
This sucks.

41:00.124 --> 41:01.708
This is crazy. Are we next?

41:01.709 --> 41:03.210
Just relax.

41:03.211 --> 41:07.416
Okay, 22C. Austin Reilly. Stand.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.218
Hey, look. Can we move this along?
Seriously, man.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.262
I'm not gonna tell you again.

41:14.514 --> 41:16.807
Mr. Reilly, what do
you do for a living?

41:16.808 --> 41:18.555
NYPD.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.644
London your final destination?

41:20.645 --> 41:23.730
My fairy brother's getting married
to a guy with a British accent.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.774
Mind if I take a
look at your phone?

41:26.401 --> 41:28.820
Come on, man. Are you serious?

41:30.321 --> 41:33.115
This is some Big Brother-type shit.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.613
Take your seat.

41:36.077 --> 41:39.079
You, step into the aisle.
Come on, up!

41:39.080 --> 41:40.414
Up! Right now!

41:40.415 --> 41:42.082
Nah, man, I'm good.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.376
I'm not asking. Shades off.

41:44.377 --> 41:45.836
Come on. What is it,
like 2:00 a.m.?

41:45.837 --> 41:47.879
Why don't you go back up there
so I can go back to sleep, man?

41:47.880 --> 41:50.007
- Shades.
- No, dude!

41:50.008 --> 41:52.631
Come on, man! Yo, chill!

41:54.721 --> 41:56.430
Let me see your phone.

41:56.431 --> 41:58.178
I don't have a phone, man.

41:59.392 --> 42:00.517
Jesus.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.977
This isn't yours?

42:01.978 --> 42:03.437
Man, I ain't never
seen that before.

42:03.438 --> 42:06.642
Looks a hell of a lot like the
one you were using at the gate.

42:17.744 --> 42:18.945
This is ridiculous.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.450
Sit down.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.408
Gladly.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.651
What happened to Amsterdam?

42:51.652 --> 42:53.320
I'm connecting to London.

42:53.321 --> 42:56.948
Show me your boarding pass.
What's your name?

42:56.949 --> 42:59.201
Tom Bowen. Why?

42:59.202 --> 43:00.952
Man, take it easy.

43:00.953 --> 43:02.329
Move!

43:02.330 --> 43:04.498
I didn't do anything!

43:05.666 --> 43:07.000
Look, I have rights!

43:07.001 --> 43:08.794
Come here.

43:10.713 --> 43:12.422
- Marenick?
- Marks, what the hell is going on there?

43:12.423 --> 43:13.507
Listen to me. The threat is real.

43:13.508 --> 43:15.675
I want you to stop doing whatever
you're doing immediately.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.845
I have a suspect in custody.
I need a background check.

43:18.846 --> 43:21.848
Seat 24E, Tom Bowen, B-O-W-E-N.

43:21.849 --> 43:24.976
You have unlawfully subdued
innocent passengers, Marks.

43:24.977 --> 43:26.019
I don't have time for this.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.313
You called your supervisor before
the flight and threatened him.

43:28.314 --> 43:30.023
- What?
- He wouldn't book you an overtime flight

43:30.024 --> 43:31.483
and you said you'd do
what you had to do.

43:31.484 --> 43:33.276
- I didn't threaten anyone.
- Is that right? Marks?

43:33.277 --> 43:36.363
I need to run a full check
on Tom Bowen, seat 24E.

43:36.364 --> 43:38.490
- Marks, damn you!
- Now! You're wasting time.

43:38.491 --> 43:41.034
Marks... Agent Marks, you are hereby
relieved of duty. Do you hear me?

43:41.035 --> 43:44.871
In three minutes, someone on this
plane is gonna die. Do you hear me?

43:44.872 --> 43:48.458
Bowen is clean, Bill. He's a
schoolteacher, for Christ's sake.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.661
He has family in London.

43:51.045 --> 43:54.875
Everyone on that flight is clean.
Everyone except you.

43:56.300 --> 43:57.672
Marks?

43:59.846 --> 44:01.798
You said Amsterdam.

44:02.140 --> 44:03.849
I never asked you
where you were going.

44:03.850 --> 44:05.475
You volunteered that information.

44:05.476 --> 44:07.185
Why would you lie
to a federal agent?

44:07.186 --> 44:09.229
Look, I didn't know you
were a federal agent.

44:09.230 --> 44:11.523
Why would you lie to a stranger?

44:11.524 --> 44:15.729
You can answer questions now, or
in federal custody when we land.

44:16.070 --> 44:17.195
Look. Okay, Jesus.

44:17.196 --> 44:19.531
He said he'd give me $100 if I asked
you where you were flying. Okay?

44:19.532 --> 44:21.032
I don't know why I said Amsterdam.

44:21.033 --> 44:22.868
I swear to God, I didn't know
you were a federal marshal.

44:22.869 --> 44:24.411
- Bullshit!
- I swear to God!

44:24.412 --> 44:27.205
He said he wanted to play a prank
on his friend. Will, right?

44:27.206 --> 44:28.790
Bill.

44:28.791 --> 44:30.375
Bill. Whatever, man.
I did it for 100 bucks.

44:30.376 --> 44:32.419
- Who was he?
- I don't know!

44:32.420 --> 44:33.503
What does he look like?

44:33.504 --> 44:37.757
He was white with brown hair, a European
accent, like 30, 35 years old...

44:37.758 --> 44:39.926
- Is he on this plane?
- I don't know, I didn't see him.

44:39.927 --> 44:42.012
When I went back, he didn't
pay me, he was already gone.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.847
- You'd know him if you saw him?
- I don't know!

44:43.848 --> 44:47.058
I never saw him get on
the plane, man, I swear!

44:47.059 --> 44:48.977
Humor me. Look!

44:51.105 --> 44:53.064
God damn it!

44:53.065 --> 44:54.767
Come on, look.

44:55.610 --> 44:57.235
I don't see him.

44:57.236 --> 44:58.608
Look.

45:01.949 --> 45:05.119
- Come on, look!
- God damn it! I don't see him!

45:06.954 --> 45:08.288
- Right there.
- Where?

45:08.289 --> 45:10.207
Right there. The glasses.

45:10.208 --> 45:11.910
Come on, move.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.463
This is crazy.

45:16.464 --> 45:19.008
You! You. Look at me.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.135
Look at me! What's your name?

45:22.136 --> 45:23.762
Michael. Michael Tate.

45:23.763 --> 45:25.597
- Well?
- It's not him.

45:25.598 --> 45:28.642
- You're sure?
- Yeah, God damn it, I'm sure!

45:29.060 --> 45:30.477
Look, if I'd seen him
get on the plane,

45:30.478 --> 45:32.812
I would've gone and
asked him for my money.

45:32.813 --> 45:34.606
What's going on?

45:34.607 --> 45:36.980
Nancy, watch business class.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.197
Turn around.

45:47.828 --> 45:49.951
- Are you serious?
- Don't talk.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.792
Now, sit down.

45:53.793 --> 45:55.370
Don't move.

46:40.381 --> 46:41.548
Oh, God.

46:41.549 --> 46:42.921
Nancy!

46:58.524 --> 47:01.022
Everybody remain in your seats.

47:01.527 --> 47:04.571
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain in your seats

47:04.572 --> 47:06.240
and keep your seatbelts fastened.

47:13.914 --> 47:16.249
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain in your seats

47:16.250 --> 47:18.873
and keep your seatbelts fastened.

47:21.213 --> 47:22.964
Nancy, are you okay?

47:22.965 --> 47:24.633
- Yeah.
- You sure?

47:24.717 --> 47:25.842
What's happened?

47:34.727 --> 47:38.229
He started having chest pains, then
he just collapsed over the yoke!

47:38.230 --> 47:39.807
- Come on, come on!
- Wake up!

47:40.941 --> 47:42.275
- Sit down!
- What the hell was that?

47:42.276 --> 47:44.027
Everything's under control.

47:44.028 --> 47:45.862
Excuse me. Excuse me.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.280
Is the captain okay?

47:47.948 --> 47:49.199
- Dr. Nasir?
- I didn't do anything, I...

47:49.200 --> 47:51.034
Come with me, now.

47:51.035 --> 47:55.080
Marshal! Is someone gonna tell
us what the hell is going on?

47:55.081 --> 47:56.122
I need your help.

47:56.123 --> 47:57.666
Hey! People are scared!

47:58.125 --> 48:00.210
We have a right to know
why you searched us.

48:00.211 --> 48:02.962
Why this plane almost went down!

48:02.963 --> 48:05.215
Hey, Marshal, you and I are
gonna have a conversation.

48:05.216 --> 48:07.967
Don't you walk away from me.

48:07.968 --> 48:09.302
Doctor, cockpit, now!

48:09.303 --> 48:10.804
You're letting that
guy in the cockpit?

48:10.805 --> 48:12.889
Here's what's gonna happen. You're
gonna get back to your seat,

48:12.890 --> 48:15.975
you're gonna sit down, and
you're gonna shut up.

48:15.976 --> 48:17.018
Or what?

48:17.019 --> 48:18.436
From one cop to another,

48:19.313 --> 48:21.015
you know.

48:33.744 --> 48:36.163
There was nothing I could do.

49:07.528 --> 49:11.198
Excuse me, miss? You were sitting
next to that guy, the marshal?

49:11.532 --> 49:13.734
You know what's happening?

49:14.034 --> 49:15.736
I have no idea.

49:18.664 --> 49:20.537
There's no evidence of assault.

49:21.041 --> 49:24.544
It could be poison.
Induced anaphylaxis.

49:24.545 --> 49:26.296
- What?
- Allergic reaction.

49:26.297 --> 49:28.545
Without an autopsy, I...

49:30.551 --> 49:31.634
Yeah.

49:31.635 --> 49:32.886
Doctor, would you mind seeing

49:32.887 --> 49:36.681
if any of the passengers in
coach need medical assistance?

49:36.682 --> 49:37.883
This...

49:38.559 --> 49:41.353
This stays between us. Please.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.183
Nancy, go with him.

50:07.087 --> 50:08.588
Kyle.

50:08.589 --> 50:12.544
Kyle, did the captain leave the
cockpit since I last spoke with him?

50:14.929 --> 50:16.930
- You?
- No.

50:16.931 --> 50:18.389
Did anyone else enter?

50:18.390 --> 50:19.933
No.

50:20.726 --> 50:24.103
Has he had anything
to eat or drink?

50:24.104 --> 50:25.521
I don't think so.

50:26.065 --> 50:28.733
Have you or the captain had any
reason to unlock this door?

50:28.734 --> 50:29.776
Of course not.

50:29.777 --> 50:31.402
So you and he were both alone here,

50:31.403 --> 50:33.323
on the flight deck, for
the past 20 minutes?

50:33.948 --> 50:35.114
You bastard.

50:35.115 --> 50:36.199
Don't get emotional.

50:36.200 --> 50:37.992
I'm getting emotional? Look at you!

50:37.993 --> 50:39.452
Rice, if you have a
problem with me...

50:39.453 --> 50:41.120
I have a problem with my
friend dying next to me.

50:41.121 --> 50:42.830
I have a problem with being accused

50:42.831 --> 50:44.499
of not only murder,
but also hijacking.

50:44.500 --> 50:45.917
I didn't accuse you of hijacking.

50:45.918 --> 50:49.254
Christ, I've heard about you.
About your problems with money.

50:49.255 --> 50:51.089
With drinking. TSA.

50:51.090 --> 50:53.800
They gave a paranoid
alcoholic a gun and a badge

50:53.801 --> 50:55.468
and they put him on my plane.

50:55.469 --> 50:57.171
Brilliant.

50:57.263 --> 50:58.972
You're gonna hit me?

50:58.973 --> 51:01.471
Don't tell... Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

51:05.896 --> 51:10.192
This door stays locked until
this plane lands safely. Okay?

51:16.991 --> 51:19.284
- Marenick...
- Marks, God damn it, I thought I told you...

51:19.285 --> 51:21.286
The captain's dead.

51:21.287 --> 51:22.495
Excuse me?

51:22.496 --> 51:25.707
The cockpit was secured,
locked from the inside.

51:25.708 --> 51:28.167
Let me guess, were
you inside, Bill?

51:28.168 --> 51:30.628
The co-pilot said the man
just collapsed beside him.

51:30.629 --> 51:34.465
It could be induced anaphylaxis,
I think it's called.

51:34.466 --> 51:36.509
Induced... What are
you talking about?

51:36.510 --> 51:38.838
Poisoning, I don't know how.

51:39.430 --> 51:43.182
It was just he and the co-pilot,
and the co-pilot, I trust.

51:43.183 --> 51:44.267
For now.

51:44.268 --> 51:46.561
"For now"? I don't
know about this, Bill.

51:46.562 --> 51:48.646
Marenick, you need to
transfer the money.

51:48.647 --> 51:49.772
Where is Agent Hammond?

51:49.773 --> 51:51.973
I need to corroborate
everything you're telling us.

51:52.318 --> 51:53.526
Hammond's dead.

51:53.527 --> 51:54.652
What?

51:54.653 --> 51:56.529
- He had cocaine in his carry-on.
- Jesus Christ!

51:56.530 --> 51:57.905
I confronted him, he pulled a gun.

51:57.906 --> 52:01.159
- Are you serious?
- Marenick. Transfer the money.

52:01.160 --> 52:02.452
Buy me time. I'll find him.

52:02.453 --> 52:03.661
Transfer the money.

52:03.662 --> 52:06.205
$150 million into your account?

52:06.206 --> 52:08.625
Is that something you're
seriously asking me to do, Bill?

52:08.626 --> 52:11.711
The moment we land, arrest me,
freeze the funds. Just transfer it.

52:11.712 --> 52:13.171
I can't do that, Bill.

52:13.172 --> 52:14.672
The airline believes
paying the demand

52:14.673 --> 52:16.591
will set a dangerous and
irreversible precedent.

52:16.592 --> 52:18.801
Christ, there are 150
people on this plane.

52:18.802 --> 52:20.803
Which makes me wonder why you
haven't cut the network.

52:20.804 --> 52:23.181
You have 150 people panicking,

52:23.182 --> 52:26.684
contacting their families, while we're
trying to handle the situation.

52:26.685 --> 52:28.269
You attribute all
this to a passenger,

52:28.270 --> 52:31.189
but you can give me no
proof he actually exists.

52:31.190 --> 52:33.191
I won't cut the network. I need
to communicate with this guy.

52:33.192 --> 52:35.568
Then, Agent Marks, I can't
continue talking to you.

52:35.569 --> 52:36.653
What does that mean?

52:36.654 --> 52:39.949
It means we will not
negotiate with a terrorist.

52:44.244 --> 52:45.445
Nancy.

52:47.414 --> 52:49.457
Who else in the crew has
access to the cockpit?

52:50.292 --> 52:51.709
Just me.

52:55.381 --> 52:58.551
Would you like to see
my phone, Agent Marks?

53:23.826 --> 53:25.326
Is your interview in the morning?

53:25.327 --> 53:26.953
Yeah. If we ever make it there.

53:26.954 --> 53:28.454
Yeah, if we ever land, right?

53:28.455 --> 53:29.956
Exactly. But it shouldn't...

53:29.957 --> 53:31.374
I'm sorry. I'll get up.

53:31.375 --> 53:33.751
No. Please, don't worry about it.
Zack, this is Bill.

53:33.752 --> 53:34.877
Bill, Zack.

53:34.878 --> 53:37.171
We were just talking and
Zack was telling me

53:37.172 --> 53:39.545
that he's a programmer
for smart phones.

53:39.883 --> 53:41.084
Is that right?

53:41.844 --> 53:43.928
Yeah. I'm interviewing
at Paige in the morning

53:43.929 --> 53:45.930
for a software analytics position.

53:45.931 --> 53:48.516
Which, technically, isn't
programming. But...

53:48.517 --> 53:50.309
Look, I'm sorry for being
such an asshole earlier...

53:50.310 --> 53:52.603
Yeah, but you were a
programmer, right?

53:52.604 --> 53:55.523
I was telling him that I
keep losing my phone,

53:55.524 --> 53:56.649
and because I keep my ringer off...

53:56.650 --> 53:59.023
It'd be nice if there
was a way to find it.

53:59.153 --> 54:01.863
Yeah, but apparently, it's
pretty simple, right?

54:01.864 --> 54:03.990
- I didn't say it was simple...
- GPS?

54:03.991 --> 54:05.408
Carrier signal triangulation?

54:05.409 --> 54:06.868
No.

54:06.869 --> 54:10.037
Basically, you just send an intrusion
virus attached to a picture text

54:10.038 --> 54:12.457
that switches the phone
from silent to ring.

54:12.458 --> 54:15.168
Most phones load images
automatically, so if you...

54:15.169 --> 54:17.795
What if there's no
cell phone coverage?

54:17.796 --> 54:20.339
If it's two phones on
a smaller network?

54:20.340 --> 54:22.675
It's the same protocol.
Even over Wi-Fi.

54:22.676 --> 54:25.174
How fast could you do
something like that?

54:25.763 --> 54:26.846
What, like right now?

54:26.847 --> 54:27.930
Yes.

54:27.931 --> 54:29.432
There are variables.

54:29.433 --> 54:30.558
The phone and the network.

54:30.559 --> 54:32.560
If the other phone is
even turned on or not.

54:32.561 --> 54:35.313
It's on. But the target
number is anonymous.

54:35.314 --> 54:38.108
You have to send it
from this phone.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.155
Jesus.

54:44.740 --> 54:46.157
Marshal, I don't know about this.

54:46.158 --> 54:47.325
Can you do it?

54:47.326 --> 54:50.119
This dude is talking about killing people.
Can he see us right now?

54:50.120 --> 54:51.321
I'm here.

54:52.080 --> 54:54.582
I guess I can give it a shot.
But I can't guarantee...

54:54.583 --> 54:55.917
How fast?

54:55.918 --> 54:57.495
Thirty minutes?

54:58.086 --> 54:59.287
Twenty?

55:00.297 --> 55:02.340
We have less than eight minutes.

55:02.674 --> 55:05.753
You can do it. That's why
they want to hire you, right?

55:06.220 --> 55:07.797
Eight minutes.

55:08.472 --> 55:09.673
Okay.

55:11.099 --> 55:12.642
Tell me when it's ready.

55:13.018 --> 55:14.219
Thanks, ma'am.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.363
Hey, hey.

55:24.822 --> 55:26.489
What did you see up there?

55:26.490 --> 55:28.783
I'm really not at liberty to say.

55:28.784 --> 55:31.533
What, are you like a
doctor or something?

55:35.582 --> 55:37.208
What the hell?

55:37.209 --> 55:40.461
Ladies and gentlemen, if I
can have your attention.

55:40.462 --> 55:42.881
The business cabin is now closed.

55:43.507 --> 55:47.844
I repeat, the business cabin
is now closed to everyone.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.929
Flight attendants, if
you could do your best,

55:49.930 --> 55:52.014
please, to accommodate
all passengers.

55:52.015 --> 55:53.387
Thank you.

56:00.357 --> 56:02.066
I have a family, for Christ's sake!

56:02.067 --> 56:04.068
We have a situation.

56:04.069 --> 56:06.320
Hey, man, you gonna tell us what
the hell is going on or not?

56:06.321 --> 56:08.489
Is the captain all right or not?

56:08.490 --> 56:13.077
The... The situation
is quite complicated.

56:13.078 --> 56:14.328
Complicated? Come on!

56:14.329 --> 56:15.663
But I can assure you...

56:15.664 --> 56:16.914
This is bullshit!

56:16.915 --> 56:18.082
Everything's in hand!

56:18.083 --> 56:19.458
Everything is under control!

56:19.459 --> 56:21.419
Everyone, calm down!

56:21.420 --> 56:22.879
I want to see the captain.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.832
I'm gonna head up there myself.

56:26.550 --> 56:27.800
That's it. Move aside, Marshal.

56:27.801 --> 56:29.218
Wait, wait. Free travel.

56:29.678 --> 56:31.470
Free flights!

56:31.471 --> 56:32.847
Free travel.

56:32.848 --> 56:35.308
The airline company will guarantee

56:35.309 --> 56:37.685
one year's international
free travel.

56:37.686 --> 56:41.898
If you sit down, remain
quiet, and do what I say.

56:41.899 --> 56:44.443
Free international travel.

56:44.902 --> 56:46.149
Thank you.

56:46.320 --> 56:47.778
Twelve months.

56:47.779 --> 56:48.980
Free.

56:49.031 --> 56:50.281
Guaranteed.

56:50.282 --> 56:52.905
One year. Free travel. Thank you.

56:55.746 --> 56:56.913
Kyle, it's Bill.

56:56.914 --> 56:58.286
Why are we turning?

56:58.999 --> 57:01.208
I've been instructed not to
communicate with you, Marks.

57:01.209 --> 57:04.458
Did they tell you to cut
the network? Listen to me.

57:05.380 --> 57:08.549
The men who issued those
instructions are not on this plane.

57:08.550 --> 57:12.845
This is your plane. These
are your passengers. Rice!

57:12.846 --> 57:13.888
Kyle!

57:13.889 --> 57:17.059
We've been diverted north.
55 minutes.

57:17.601 --> 57:19.018
Did they tell you
to cut the network?

57:19.019 --> 57:20.562
I have orders, Marks.

57:20.938 --> 57:23.356
Give me five minutes. Five minutes.

57:23.357 --> 57:24.857
Land the plane wherever you want,

57:24.858 --> 57:26.317
but do not switch that network off.

57:26.318 --> 57:29.987
Do you hear me? I have a plan.
I can find this guy.

57:29.988 --> 57:31.610
Five minutes.

57:39.581 --> 57:41.916
I hope we can trust this guy.

57:41.917 --> 57:43.167
I trust him.

57:43.168 --> 57:47.339
Yeah, well, I'd rather not end
up an accessory to a hijacking.

57:47.714 --> 57:49.423
- Okay.
- Zack.

57:49.424 --> 57:51.717
It's done.
Here it is.

57:51.718 --> 57:52.919
Good man.

57:54.638 --> 57:56.806
You think the captain's still
in control of the plane?

57:56.807 --> 57:58.391
The plane almost goes down,

57:58.392 --> 58:00.935
there's a guy waving his gun
around, tying people up.

58:00.936 --> 58:02.812
I'd say he pretty
much took control.

58:02.813 --> 58:07.234
So you think the thing about free
international flights was bullshit, or...

58:09.027 --> 58:11.904
At what point do we do something?

58:11.905 --> 58:14.907
Gentlemen, would you please
return to your seats?

58:14.908 --> 58:16.909
You don't know what's
going on either, do you?

58:38.765 --> 58:41.184
So, what's the air
marshal up to now?

58:43.895 --> 58:45.146
Ladies and gentlemen,

58:45.147 --> 58:47.481
I need every passenger to raise
their hands above their heads

58:47.482 --> 58:49.855
and remain silent for
the next 60 seconds.

58:51.153 --> 58:53.071
This is not a request.

58:56.533 --> 58:58.235
Up.

58:59.453 --> 59:01.326
Flight attendants, too.

59:06.209 --> 59:07.831
Up!

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.105
- Hands behind your head.
- What the fuck...

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.546
Hands behind your goddamn head!

01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:16.063
Remove the phone. With one hand.

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:22.531
I've never seen that phone before.

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:24.825
Miss, undo his seatbelt.

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.498
Stand up, now.

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:30.502
You searched me.
My phone was in my bag.

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:32.044
Into the aisle.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:33.546
Whatever you think I've done...

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:36.382
Shut up. Front of the plane. Move!

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:37.967
You're making a mistake.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.715
Turn around.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:41.763
Take it easy!

01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:43.673
What's going on?

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:48.011
Listen to me, please!
That's not my phone!

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:50.229
Who are you?

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:52.023
Just a passenger!

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:54.525
Why did you open the
account in my name?

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:55.818
I don't know what
you're talking about!

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.445
Answer the question, or
I will break your arm.

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:00.239
You got the wrong guy!

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.948
We found him, Nancy. We got him.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.667
Why me? Why?

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:13.211
Why me?

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.501
Why?

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:20.586
Nancy, get the doctor. Now!

01:01:58.548 --> 01:01:59.265
Bill? Bill?

01:01:59.266 --> 01:02:00.504
Bill? Bill?

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:08.891
Okay, let's break this down.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:11.810
First, he ties up that guy, then he takes
another guy and brings him out back.

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:13.854
What, is he gonna pick
us off one by one?

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:17.309
That's the doctor right there. Hey.

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:21.529
You want to let us all
know what's going on?

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.993
- And the captain?
- Dead.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:36.370
The co-pilot is flying.
Behind locked doors.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:51.767
- Are you all right?
- Me? Fine. I'm great.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.936
You shouldn't be seeing all this.

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:58.809
All right, Doc. So, we got a
dead passenger and a dead pilot.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:01.777
The plane took a hard
turn 15 minutes ago.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.612
That doesn't happen mid-flight.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.031
The marshal closed
off business class,

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:08.409
moved all the
passengers to the back.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.283
Does this scenario ring any bells?

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:13.136
You think he's gonna
crash the plane?

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:20.356
Flight 10, this is
Royal Air Force 114,

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:22.730
call sign Jackrabbit. How copy?

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:12.699
Excuse me.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.410
I was told I could stay
here with my husband.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:15.828
Of course.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:18.623
You used the lavatory about an
hour ago. Do you remember that?

01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:20.659
I don't have Alzheimer's.

01:05:21.709 --> 01:05:24.287
Do you know if someone else
went in there after you?

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:28.333
Yes, she was standing
there blocking the aisle.

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:29.591
Who?

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:30.839
The redhead.

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:33.638
The woman you were sitting next to.

01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:47.356
What are you doing in here?

01:05:47.986 --> 01:05:50.821
I'm drinking. I'm sorry, I shouldn't.
That's just terrible.

01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:52.569
I've been wondering.

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:56.535
Why the window seat?

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:58.579
What? Why the window seat?

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.914
Why did you sit next to me?

01:06:00.915 --> 01:06:02.708
- What?
- I found a hole

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:05.961
in the first class toilet,
clear shot to the captain.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:09.257
The guy who died had one of
these imbedded in his skin.

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:11.793
Ever seen one before?

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:13.260
No.

01:06:13.261 --> 01:06:16.513
The toilets were locked 10
minutes before the captain died.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.887
Five minutes before that,
I saw a woman enter.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.226
She's 70 years old.

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.187
She said you went in after her,

01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:27.063
and she doesn't have Alzheimer's,
if you're wondering.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:31.153
Are you asking me if I
saw someone else go in,

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:32.947
or if I killed the captain?

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.988
Did you see someone else?

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:39.119
No.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.867
Then answer the question.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:43.875
You're a dick.

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:47.628
You switched seats to be next to
me, which made you trustworthy.

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:49.254
You engaged me in conversation.

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:50.339
To relax you because
you were scared...

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.548
Yet you evaded personal questions.

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:54.468
You mean, like where I work. Yeah,
that's a great personal question.

01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:55.969
You inserted yourself
into the investigation.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:57.221
Are you serious?

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:58.680
Tracking the phone,
that was your idea.

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.890
Are you kidding me?

01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:02.434
I am the only person on this
plane who has stood by you.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:03.810
You've been lying to
me this entire time.

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:05.896
You've been lying to me since the
second you boarded this plane.

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:08.691
Oh, God! Okay, fine, fine!

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.612
Seven years ago my heart failed,

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:16.281
and I was dead for like 43 minutes.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.116
Aortic arch aneurysm.

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:20.285
They tried to fix it,
but when I woke up,

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:21.954
they told me it was
something they couldn't fix

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:25.876
and that one day it would fail
again and I would just die.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:29.920
And that's okay with me because
we're all gonna die someday,

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:32.464
and none of us know when
it's gonna be, right?

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:35.635
But when I fly, which is a lot,

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.053
I like to look out the
window instead of

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.721
at the back of the
seat in front of me

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:42.471
or a folding tray table, because
one day might be today.

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:48.647
Why do you like the aisle?

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:50.312
Dick.

01:07:57.115 --> 01:07:58.612
Wait a second.

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:02.744
Here.

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:06.866
Let me pour you a real drink.

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.380
Thanks.

01:08:17.468 --> 01:08:19.045
I'm sorry.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:23.933
I hate flying.

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:26.803
Really?

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.187
I always kind of
liked it, you know?

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:31.773
Six hours in the same spot,
nobody can get to you.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.359
Nothing to do but just
be present, you know?

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:36.233
You have no control.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:39.823
Control is an illusion.
There is no control.

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.906
Over anything.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.703
You need to listen to this.

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:51.627
Where a federal bomb squad and
investigators are searching

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:54.337
a car that allegedly
belongs to Bill Marks.

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:58.466
Sources tell us that Marks parked
his car here at the airport today

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:01.303
before boarding British
Aqualantic Flight 10,

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:03.889
the way he had boarded
so many flights before,

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.224
in the guise of an
everyday passenger,

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:07.643
but carrying a mandate

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.479
from the United States
Department of Homeland Security.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.731
His job, to protect the flight.

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:16.568
And he was also, as always,
carrying a concealed handgun.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:20.322
Well, we know this is the hijacker's
phone. Can it tell us anything?

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.241
It's password protected.
I can't get in.

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:24.444
Did you try guessing?

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:36.880
This is a transatlantic flight
from New York to London,

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:39.299
the airline now confirming this is,

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.049
in fact, a hijacking in progress.

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:48.392
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything, I swear to God.

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:51.015
I just was messing around with it.
I didn't do anything.

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:08.453
Open every bag in this cabin.

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:11.957
And the horrific twist
is that the hijacker

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:13.792
is now believed to be
the one person who

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:15.627
was authorized to carry
a gun onto the plane.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:18.880
You're looking for a package.
You'll know if you find it.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.958
- Every bag. Go! Now!
- Okay.

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:22.467
Marenick.

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:24.010
- Marks?
- Order this plane down to 8,000 feet.

01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:25.345
Marks, listen to me.

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:26.972
I have reason to believe
there's a bomb on the plane.

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:29.099
- Agent Marks, just listen to me.
- We need to drop altitude now.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.143
A bomb at this height would
tear this plane apart.

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:33.228
and questions already
swirling around

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.230
Bill Marks and his state of mind

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.690
as he boarded the flight...

01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:39.151
Bill, when you send
me a text and you say

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:41.361
that you're out of options, you and
I both know that's not the case.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:43.196
Who else received that message?

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:44.948
Clearly, we got it here at TSA.

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:46.908
We're getting calls from
the FBI, the White House,

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:48.493
and now the press is involved.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:51.955
You have our attention. There's no
need to take this any further, Bill.

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:55.584
No one else has to die. I know it feels
like no one is listening, but I am.

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:56.752
We'll work it out together.

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:58.295
Marenick, you're not getting this!

01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:00.922
Bill, listen to me.
Let's talk this through.

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.716
You're talking to me
like I'm a terrorist.

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:03.842
You know how this works.

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:06.511
If you try to bring that plane any
lower into civilian airspace,

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.013
you will be shot down.

01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:09.681
You're a threat to ground, Bill.

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:11.224
Just wait for your
money and sit tight.

01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:15.146
A stark picture of a man in a
dangerous psychological state.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:18.566
Bill, stay with me. I need
you to cooperate with us...

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:20.233
What now?

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:22.778
Officials say he was originally
from Northern Ireland.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:24.738
He became a decorated New York City

01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:26.698
police officer with a young family.

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:29.576
He became distraught when his
8-year-old daughter, Olivia,

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:31.286
passed away from cancer.

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:34.164
Over the next decade, sources
say he became withdrawn,

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:36.333
got divorced in 2003.

01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:39.037
Suspended and later
fired from the NYPD,

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:41.087
it was then, in the summer of 2003,

01:11:41.088 --> 01:11:44.591
that he transferred to the
Federal Air Marshal Service.

01:11:44.592 --> 01:11:46.593
And there, his
colleagues and neighbors

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:49.304
saying he's a quiet man who
kept mostly to himself.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.598
This is a costly program, as well.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:54.392
There's no question. This is what
happens when you put an unstable,

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:56.102
angry man in a position of power.

01:11:56.103 --> 01:11:57.729
This guy wasn't even
born in the U.S.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.314
He could be IRA, for all we know.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:00.398
Thank you.

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:03.610
Since 9/11, we've put 4,000
air marshals in the sky.

01:12:03.611 --> 01:12:05.153
Where do these people come from?

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.780
I've seen these guys myself.

01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:08.907
They walk right past
the security line

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:10.992
and they're barely qualified
to carry a badge.

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.994
Walked right past security.

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:15.205
There's controversy around the
air marshal program already.

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:16.957
Is this the final blow?

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:17.002
We give these people
absolute power in the sky.

01:12:17.003 --> 01:12:19.793
We give these people
absolute power in the sky.

01:12:19.794 --> 01:12:21.586
We give them guns and
we put them on planes,

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:25.837
and we're surprised when we have
incidences of drug smuggling.

01:13:02.336 --> 01:13:04.209
Oh, God.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:19.845
Now!

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:22.139
Go, go, go!

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.273
Grab him! Grab him! Get the gun!

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:28.069
- Help me, man!
- Wait!

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.817
Hey, stop it!

01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:31.823
Stop it!
No, no, no, no.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:33.116
Stay down!

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:37.671
- Take him down! Kick his ass!
- Somebody stop him.

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:48.215
Stop it!

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:50.710
Oh, my God!

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:53.550
Stop!

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:56.723
Help me, man!

01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:58.176
Let go of him!

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:00.852
Stop!

01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:11.363
Get him to the ground!
Hold him steady!

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.405
Get his legs!

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:13.823
Hold him, God damn it!

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:15.617
- Grab his legs!
- Listen to me!

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:16.701
- Listen to me!
- Shut up!

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:19.162
Listen to me, please!
Please, go into the bathroom!

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:20.455
- Pin him down!
- In the bathroom!

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.248
- You're done, Marshal!
- There's a dead body!

01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:23.375
Shut the hell up! Shut up!

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:24.501
There's a dead body
and a briefcase!

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:25.835
In the briefcase
you'll find a bomb!

01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:27.253
Bullshit, you're lying!

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:28.797
There is a bomb on this plane.

01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:32.214
Believe me, please!

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:35.345
Get off of him.

01:14:35.346 --> 01:14:38.220
I said get off of him! Get off him!

01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:40.681
Do it now. Get back, back!

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:43.353
Back away, all of you.

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:45.395
You don't know what you're
doing with that gun.

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:47.770
Come on. What is he doing?

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:50.068
Bowen, give me the gun.

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:51.903
- Tom, please.
- No, stay where you are.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:55.278
I'm NYPD, we got it covered!
Put it down!

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:57.777
Is there a bomb on this plane?

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:07.252
I want you to tell me what
the hell is going on.

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:09.626
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax!

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:13.508
A passenger on board
this flight has

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:16.258
threatened to kill
someone every 20 minutes

01:15:17.388 --> 01:15:19.966
unless they're paid $150 million.

01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:23.386
And now, three people are dead.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:27.147
The bomb will explode in
less than half an hour.

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:31.143
Now, they want you to believe
that I'm responsible.

01:15:32.403 --> 01:15:34.612
Everything you've heard
about me is true.

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:38.818
I've lost my family, my job.
I'm an alcoholic.

01:15:40.578 --> 01:15:43.705
My daughter was diagnosed with
acute leukemia at the age of five,

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:48.126
and I spent my days at work
instead of being at home,

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:52.377
looking after her, because I was
afraid of watching her die!

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.300
I'm not a good father.
I'm not a good man.

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.934
I'm not hijacking this plane.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:06.061
I'm trying to save it!

01:16:07.605 --> 01:16:11.730
And I will save it!
If you work with me.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.828
You're NYPD. So was I,

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:26.331
and you look as if you were
a better officer than I was.

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:28.205
Cut him loose. Nancy.

01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:41.638
We need to start moving all
the luggage towards the back.

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:42.889
And move the women and children,

01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:44.610
move them up to the
front of the plane.

01:16:44.892 --> 01:16:46.226
That's your plan?

01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:48.770
My job is to prepare for the
worst possible outcome.

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:50.605
Well, my job is to prevent it.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:53.559
Women and children, no exceptions.
Men move up in coach.

01:16:56.654 --> 01:16:57.904
What the hell are you thinking?

01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:00.198
There's a plan of
action that exists

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:03.618
called the Least Resistant
Bomb Location Protocol.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.703
You place the bomb
against the rear door

01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:07.781
and stack anything and
everything against it.

01:17:07.832 --> 01:17:12.127
Every bag, blanket, every pillow.
Nullify it as best you can.

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:14.921
At this height a bomb would
tear this plane apart,

01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:19.384
but we descend to 8,000
feet, pressure equalizes,

01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:21.178
and then we have a chance.

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:24.889
So you're just gonna
let the bomb go off?

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:27.642
Of course not, I'm gonna stop it.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:30.517
But if I can't, I'd rather
be prepared, wouldn't you?

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:34.604
The man who brought this bomb
on the plane may try something.

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:36.485
Can I trust you to stop him?

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.986
You're damn straight you can.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:48.622
Hey, Reilly, sorry about the nose.

01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:51.792
It was never my best feature.

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:55.879
Can't you get them to wire the money?
Just try something?

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.297
This was never about the money.

01:17:57.298 --> 01:17:58.966
Then what's it about?

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:02.962
I'm not sure. They used
an account in my name.

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:05.513
They want an air marshal
to take down a plane

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:08.099
with 150 people on board,

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:11.053
and they want the whole
world to see it.

01:18:11.478 --> 01:18:14.397
I was never supposed
to find that bomb.

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:24.691
Look.

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:28.328
That's not good.

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:30.247
Do you know what that means?

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:37.003
Aqualantic Flight 10, this
is Royal Air Force 114,

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:39.672
call sign Jackrabbit. How copy?

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:41.549
Copy, Jackrabbit.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:44.260
We will be your escorts to
the designated landing zone.

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:46.137
Do not deviate from
your current course

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:47.972
or altitude without authorization.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:50.346
- Do you copy?
- Copy.

01:18:51.685 --> 01:18:52.886
Kyle.

01:18:54.104 --> 01:18:55.480
- Kyle.
- Yes, Marks?

01:18:55.481 --> 01:18:56.522
We have a new situation.

01:18:56.523 --> 01:18:58.441
Yeah, no shit.

01:18:58.442 --> 01:19:00.818
I need you to drop the
plane to 8,000 feet.

01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:03.196
Get to the lowest pressure
deferential you can.

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:04.990
One PSI, 1.5 at most.

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:07.408
Wait, Bill, that's
explosives protocol.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:11.614
Yes, we have 16
minutes, give or take.

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:13.707
You know we have company, right?

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:16.209
Two typhoons are
flanking me right now.

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:18.169
They're watching, and
you want me to...

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:20.838
Kyle, we need to drop altitude now.

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:24.259
Look, I have orders, Marks. Any
suspicious activity and they...

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.677
Rice!

01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:29.180
There is a bomb on this plane. We
have to descend to 8,000 feet.

01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:32.892
All right, give me 10 minutes.
If we drop now, I lose speed.

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:35.728
Ten minutes at this altitude,
maybe I can get us close enough,

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:37.480
close enough to land in Iceland.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:39.183
Ten minutes. Thanks.

01:20:08.679 --> 01:20:13.057
It's an RDX explosive. Very
professional. Maybe military.

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:14.259
Is that blow?

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:17.930
Are you positive it
can't be disarmed?

01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:20.315
This is a calibrated
pressure trigger.

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:23.067
The only way to disarm a bomb
is to remove the trigger.

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:27.739
But remove the trigger, the pressure
releases, the bomb goes off.

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.907
- Well, can't we just dump it?
- Same principle in reverse.

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:31.826
The low pressure outside the plane

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:33.619
won't hold the trigger.
You try to dump it...

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:34.704
The bomb goes off.

01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:36.914
- Isn't there like a wire you can cut?
- No.

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:38.499
So, if this guy doesn't
get his money,

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.043
he's gonna kill himself
and everyone aboard?

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:41.669
I can't believe this.
This is crazy.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.629
- Why aren't we looking for this guy?
- We're out of time.

01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:45.340
That's a bullshit answer,
Marshal, you know it.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:46.549
Take it easy.

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:49.177
There's 150 passengers and crew.
It could be anyone.

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:51.929
Let's find him! Let's pay
him, let's do something.

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.974
It's not about the money,
and even if I find him...

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:58.642
I don't think he ever intended
to get off this plane.

01:20:59.229 --> 01:21:01.147
My God, we're all gonna die.

01:21:04.234 --> 01:21:05.526
No!

01:21:06.153 --> 01:21:10.448
We gotta place the bomb here. Stack
all available luggage over it.

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:12.116
And direct the explosion outward.

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:15.535
At 8,000 feet, the pressure
will equalize. Then we land.

01:21:15.536 --> 01:21:18.206
- With a hole in the fuselage?
- And this has worked before?

01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:21.000
It's never been tried before.

01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:22.919
- That you know of.
- You're not being helpful, Doctor.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.128
We're so screwed.

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:25.296
It could work! We've got to try!

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:28.546
Come on! Grab every able hand!
Let's get this done!

01:21:30.094 --> 01:21:33.264
Marshal, if they're setting
this thing off, no matter what,

01:21:34.348 --> 01:21:36.050
what are they waiting for?

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:39.394
Just grab what you
can, go to the back.

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:40.812
All right, you guys form a chain,

01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:43.516
send those bags back
as fast as you can.

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:49.147
Please remove all luggage
from the overhead bins.

01:21:56.954 --> 01:22:00.704
Kyle, how close are we?
We need to descend, now!

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:02.618
No, give me three minutes.

01:22:03.377 --> 01:22:05.294
Three minutes, okay.

01:22:05.295 --> 01:22:08.881
Look at your watch. Three minutes
from now, not a second longer.

01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:11.961
No matter what happens,
drop down 8,000 feet.

01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:13.469
Okay.

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:15.760
- Take this.
- Lighter luggage up front.

01:22:15.806 --> 01:22:18.808
Keep piling please. Bring
the heavier luggage down.

01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:20.056
Keep them going.

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:23.396
Sir, keep that with
you, I just need...

01:22:23.397 --> 01:22:24.598
Your nose.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.437
Yeah, it's bleeding, thanks.

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:28.317
You have a displaced fracture.

01:22:28.318 --> 01:22:31.279
Look, it's a broken nose, it's
normal, I don't need you to fix it.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.029
Look, I'm going to set your nose.

01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:35.825
Here, hold this.

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:36.951
Just make it quick, all right?

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:38.369
Apply some pressure.

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.079
Okay.

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:42.620
On three. One...

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:53.926
Sweetheart, you've got to come out.

01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:56.387
It's all right, I'll hold your hand.
But it's not safe.

01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:57.972
- Gwen, what's going on?
- Please.

01:22:57.973 --> 01:22:59.348
We need to hurry.

01:22:59.349 --> 01:23:03.060
Sorry. I'm sorry, I need your help.
She won't come out.

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:06.265
What's wrong? Are you scared?

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:09.146
I wanna see my daddy.

01:23:09.443 --> 01:23:11.771
I know you do, sweetheart.
I know you do.

01:23:12.613 --> 01:23:16.113
You know, I was a daddy once to
a little girl just like you,

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:18.994
and when she was scared,
you know what she'd do?

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:23.122
She had a magic ribbon,
very powerful.

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:26.577
It'll protect you,
just like your daddy.

01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:30.087
You wanna see it?
I have it in my pocket.

01:23:30.088 --> 01:23:33.382
I carry it all the time.
Here it is. Here.

01:23:33.383 --> 01:23:36.511
You wrap it around your
hand, just like that.

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:38.806
That's it, hold on to it now.

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:42.434
Are you bribing me?

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:46.354
Yes, I am.

01:23:48.732 --> 01:23:52.401
This is my friend, Jen.
She's gonna look after you.

01:23:52.402 --> 01:23:53.861
- Jen, this is Becca.
- Hey.

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:56.656
Don't worry, you'll see your
father soon. I promise.

01:23:58.283 --> 01:23:59.826
Can I have the window seat?

01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:04.827
You mean this old seat?
Mm-hm.

01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:12.630
Ladies and gentlemen, we're
about to begin our descent.

01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:16.217
I need you to return to your
seats and fasten your seatbelts.

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:18.803
Please stay calm. Everyone,
please get back to your seats.

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:21.973
Yeah?

01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:23.599
Marks, we transferred the money,

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.184
150 million US into your account.

01:24:25.185 --> 01:24:27.311
It's too late for the money.
Whatever he's doing...

01:24:27.312 --> 01:24:29.772
You can stop now, Marks.
You have your money.

01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:30.940
The jets will escort you in.

01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:32.817
I have to bring this plane
down to 8,000 feet.

01:24:32.818 --> 01:24:35.152
You will not descend
into civilian airspace.

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:38.781
You think he wants the money?
You think that will stop him?

01:24:38.782 --> 01:24:41.033
If you transferred
the money, prove it.

01:24:41.034 --> 01:24:44.787
You want proof? Here's your proof,
$150 million was transferred

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:51.168
to account CH-1000-23000-A-10982.

01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:54.839
Confirmation code R48940.

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:59.051
We'll escort you into
a military air field,

01:24:59.052 --> 01:25:01.679
you will not be arrested,
no questions will be asked.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.974
There is a bomb on this plane.
It isn't mine. It will go off!

01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:07.852
- And we have to prepare...
- You're in command of a hijacked vessel

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:09.520
and you will not dive that
plane into civilian airspace.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:10.605
I will!

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:12.356
Then, Marks, God damn it,
we will shoot you down!

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:15.860
Someday, they'll fish this plane's
black box out of the Atlantic Ocean,

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:17.862
and the world will know these
people could have been saved.

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:19.447
The world already
knows what's going on

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:20.906
in that plane, Bill.
You are hijacking it.

01:25:20.907 --> 01:25:22.450
- That's what you're telling them.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:24.201
That's what your hostages
are telling them.

01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:27.413
That video is playing on every major
news network on repeat, Bill.

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:30.333
- What video?
- One of your hostages uploaded a video.

01:25:30.334 --> 01:25:32.835
You're taking a man, dragging
him around at gunpoint,

01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:34.837
stumbling over
terrified passengers.

01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:37.381
How do you expect us to believe
anything that you're saying

01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:39.467
when you clearly are
abusing those hostages?

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:41.218
We've seen everything
we need to know.

01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:43.092
But we're trying to negotiate...

01:25:49.269 --> 01:25:51.395
Your phone, now! The phone!

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:53.439
Show me the video that
you uploaded! Come on!

01:25:58.236 --> 01:26:00.859
I apologize for my son.

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:05.823
Humor me. Look!

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:08.621
- Look.
- I don't see him.

01:26:08.622 --> 01:26:09.869
Come on, look.

01:26:12.084 --> 01:26:13.709
- Right there.
- Where?

01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:15.662
Glasses.
Come on, move.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.423
God damn it!

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:21.126
You. Look...

01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:30.635
God damn it!

01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:47.949
Stay where you are.

01:26:48.495 --> 01:26:50.038
Bill, don't test me!

01:26:54.668 --> 01:26:56.495
Bill.

01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:58.747
Reilly, drop!

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:02.258
Reilly, get down!

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:04.336
You gave me an unloaded weapon?

01:27:04.511 --> 01:27:06.088
Overhead bin, 4B!

01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:08.965
Everybody, down! Stay down!

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:14.808
- Hey, get out of there, move!
- What?

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.689
Hey, man!

01:27:23.155 --> 01:27:24.527
You looking for this?

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:27.154
Give me that.

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:29.785
What are you doing?

01:27:42.716 --> 01:27:44.175
- Get back!
- Okay, okay.

01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:47.097
Jackrabbit, I have shots fired outside
this cockpit, need to descend.

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:51.175
That's a negative, Flight 10, do not deviate
from your current course or altitude.

01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:56.055
Turn around.

01:27:56.354 --> 01:27:57.772
I need all of you to put your hands

01:27:57.773 --> 01:27:59.270
on the seat-back in front of you.

01:27:59.399 --> 01:28:00.942
Do it now!

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:03.353
- Move.
- Don't test me.

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:05.067
Step back!

01:28:05.363 --> 01:28:06.864
Put your hands up!

01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:08.073
Sit!

01:28:08.074 --> 01:28:09.867
Sit, sit!

01:28:12.329 --> 01:28:14.288
He was supposed to be in
the seat next to mine.

01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:16.207
Yeah. He was close enough.

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:21.585
Listen, whatever I've done to
you, whatever it is, I'm sorry.

01:28:22.047 --> 01:28:23.373
Stay down!

01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:25.800
Bill, I'm not mad at you.

01:28:26.384 --> 01:28:27.756
You're my hero.

01:28:27.886 --> 01:28:30.679
People everywhere are gonna
remember the name Bill Marks.

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.807
An alcoholic, self-destructive,

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:34.892
suicidal man with a gun
and a federal badge

01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:36.018
who changed everything.

01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:37.937
What do you think doing
this is gonna change?

01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:40.189
Two minutes outside
the window. Suit up.

01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:42.066
Every one of these people
boarded this plane

01:28:42.067 --> 01:28:43.859
believing their country
would protect them.

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.437
That you would protect them.

01:28:48.782 --> 01:28:50.241
Everyone!

01:28:50.242 --> 01:28:51.785
We're gonna be okay!

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:53.824
There's an air marshal on board.

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.703
Do you have any idea
how easy this was?

01:28:57.749 --> 01:29:00.251
You're right, I failed.
You've made your point.

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:02.795
No, Bill, you failed miserably!

01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:07.547
Three thousand people died
that day, including my father!

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:10.967
So I joined up 'cause I wanted to
go fight the cowards that did it.

01:29:11.096 --> 01:29:14.348
But I just ended up fighting in a
war that I still don't understand

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:17.223
and came home to a country
where nothing had changed.

01:29:17.853 --> 01:29:19.100
Until now.

01:29:19.437 --> 01:29:22.311
Security is this
country's biggest lie.

01:29:22.566 --> 01:29:27.146
In our homes, in our cities,
in our planes, no one's safe,

01:29:27.612 --> 01:29:30.986
and one day somebody worse than
me is gonna expose that lie,

01:29:31.533 --> 01:29:32.700
and the last thing our
children will see

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:34.778
is our failure as it destroys them.

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:39.456
You, Bill, you are that lie!

01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:41.166
You should just have
handed out pamphlets.

01:29:41.167 --> 01:29:42.914
It would have been a lot easier.

01:29:46.965 --> 01:29:48.799
You can't change the
world with words, Bill,

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.010
unless you write those words in
the evening news with blood.

01:29:51.011 --> 01:29:52.136
We gotta go.

01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:55.681
You're military. These are the
people you fought to protect.

01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:59.018
I swore to protect my country,
and that's what I'm doing.

01:29:59.019 --> 01:30:00.811
- You believe that?
- I do.

01:30:00.812 --> 01:30:03.606
I also believe we'll be
$150 million richer.

01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:06.150
You'll never get that money.
It's in an account in my name.

01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:08.103
It's in a trust in your name.

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:11.155
I die, the money moves.

01:30:11.156 --> 01:30:14.992
To 100 accounts, 27 countries, each
of those into 100 other accounts.

01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:17.202
When do you think
you're gonna jump?

01:30:17.203 --> 01:30:19.330
35,000 feet? You'll be
dead in four seconds.

01:30:19.331 --> 01:30:21.909
We'll jump when the pilot
follows explosive protocol

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:24.211
and drops us down to 8,000 feet.

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:26.880
Anything you think of, we've
thought of a thousand times.

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:29.673
They've been instructed to shoot
us down if we try to descend.

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:31.175
That's bullshit!

01:30:31.176 --> 01:30:33.218
They're not gonna kill
all these people.

01:30:33.219 --> 01:30:37.344
This is a hijacked flight. We're
a classified threat to ground.

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:41.888
If you don't disarm that bomb, everyone
on board will die, including you.

01:30:42.228 --> 01:30:43.554
Did you think of that?

01:30:43.897 --> 01:30:46.190
- Look, I'm prepared to die.
- We're not gonna die.

01:30:46.191 --> 01:30:48.943
Say again, Jackrabbit.
I need to descend.

01:30:48.944 --> 01:30:50.316
That's a negative, Flight 10.

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:53.280
I'm gonna stick with the plan.
We descend, we jump.

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:54.823
The plane goes down,
we have enough money.

01:30:54.824 --> 01:30:56.200
We can do whatever we want.

01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:59.655
Think about it, Tommy. We can
disappear and never come back.

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:03.958
You hear me? Never be found, ever.
Mission accomplished, right?

01:31:04.334 --> 01:31:06.377
But right now we need to get
the hell off this plane.

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:10.253
Zack, you and I both know we were
never getting off this plane.

01:31:12.217 --> 01:31:15.967
Zack, whatever your name
is, you don't have to die.

01:31:16.262 --> 01:31:18.760
If you won't save these
people, save yourself.

01:31:19.099 --> 01:31:20.767
Disarm the bomb.

01:31:22.477 --> 01:31:24.145
Come on, do it.

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:43.497
He was a martyr,
like you and me, Bill.

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:46.917
Real heroes don't need to be
remembered or recognized.

01:31:46.918 --> 01:31:48.961
Real heroes do
whatever's necessary.

01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:50.914
I guess I wouldn't understand.

01:31:51.756 --> 01:31:53.754
- Fuck it!
- I guess you wouldn't.

01:32:17.323 --> 01:32:18.649
No!

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.794
20,000! Come on, you wanker!

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:57.731
8,000 feet! Come on, come on!

01:32:59.824 --> 01:33:01.401
Bill!

01:33:17.092 --> 01:33:18.293
8,000!

01:33:39.864 --> 01:33:42.658
- AQ 10, climb back up to 25,000 feet!
- There's a bomb on board!

01:33:42.659 --> 01:33:44.379
I need to get this
plane on the ground.

01:33:48.873 --> 01:33:51.997
Nancy, move, move!
Everybody down, heads down!

01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:54.378
Hey. Bill!

01:33:54.379 --> 01:33:56.081
I'm getting off this plane!

01:33:56.881 --> 01:33:58.924
Am I in your way, asshole?

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:21.905
Get down!

01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:24.279
Do it quick! Heads down!

01:34:30.707 --> 01:34:32.204
Get down!

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:44.804
Come on, Kyle! You can do this!
You can do this, come on.

01:34:51.436 --> 01:34:52.936
Severe damage to your fuselage.

01:34:52.937 --> 01:34:54.514
Are you able to maintain control?

01:35:01.237 --> 01:35:02.438
Shit!

01:35:07.118 --> 01:35:08.945
Fuel dump in progress.

01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:11.501
- Copy that, Flight 10.
- Come on, damn it!

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:14.751
A little longer, come on!

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:32.598
Oh, God!

01:35:36.814 --> 01:35:38.641
Get the belt! Get the belt!

01:35:42.111 --> 01:35:44.359
- Hang on!
- Bill, help me!

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:46.365
Becca, I have you!

01:35:46.783 --> 01:35:49.031
Hang onto me! Hang onto me!

01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:08.762
You okay? Are you okay?

01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:14.890
- Door is disarmed.
- Release your seatbelts!

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:18.855
- Take her. Everybody.
- Come on with me.

01:36:18.856 --> 01:36:21.316
Undo your seatbelt!
Move to the front, quickly.

01:36:21.317 --> 01:36:23.895
Leave everything. Come
this way, up to the front.

01:36:24.404 --> 01:36:26.481
One at a time, please.

01:36:26.531 --> 01:36:28.404
Leave everything.

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:32.869
Leave everything.

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:34.117
Up to the front.

01:36:34.872 --> 01:36:36.198
Leave everything.

01:37:13.703 --> 01:37:16.531
All passengers and
crew accounted for.

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:18.832
And you, are you all right?

01:37:19.334 --> 01:37:20.911
That was a hell of a landing.

01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:29.384
Less than one hour ago,
British Aqualantic Flight 10

01:37:29.385 --> 01:37:33.135
made an emergency landing after
a bomb exploded mid-air.

01:37:33.765 --> 01:37:37.768
This following an attempted hijacking,
yet in an unbelievable twist,

01:37:37.769 --> 01:37:40.854
the suspected hijacker, U.S.
Air Marshal Bill Marks,

01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:42.647
turned out to be the hero.

01:37:42.648 --> 01:37:46.068
It was Marks who confronted
and killed the hijackers,

01:37:46.069 --> 01:37:48.271
saving the lives...

01:37:48.863 --> 01:37:51.031
- Yeah?
- It's Marenick.

01:37:51.616 --> 01:37:54.158
It's my turn to break
protocol, Agent Marks.

01:37:54.159 --> 01:37:55.494
I'm calling from my personal line

01:37:55.495 --> 01:37:57.954
and I'll deny this
conversation ever took place.

01:37:57.955 --> 01:38:02.877
Listen, Bill, what you did on that
plane, what you were up against,

01:38:03.211 --> 01:38:05.880
I want you to know I
was wrong about you.

01:38:07.382 --> 01:38:09.550
And you'll have my full support.

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.545
Appreciate that.

01:38:13.262 --> 01:38:15.009
And, Bill,

01:38:15.431 --> 01:38:17.178
we're gonna need that money back.

01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:20.478
What money?

01:38:21.646 --> 01:38:23.769
Take care, Agent Marks.

01:38:38.121 --> 01:38:39.948
Marshal!

01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:44.709
Reilly, you son of a gun.

01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:46.503
Next time, give me a loaded weapon.

01:38:46.504 --> 01:38:48.377
Next time, don't get shot.

01:38:48.673 --> 01:38:50.045
Deal.

01:38:58.349 --> 01:38:59.949
I'm gonna give you
back your ribbon.

01:39:01.102 --> 01:39:02.519
I don't need it anymore.

01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:06.065
That-a-girl.

01:39:06.858 --> 01:39:08.560
It's your dad.

01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:13.147
Daddy.

01:39:25.376 --> 01:39:27.999
- Hey, I was looking for you!
- Hey.

01:39:29.255 --> 01:39:31.506
- Do you know where we are?
- Iceland.

01:39:31.507 --> 01:39:34.092
Ah! Well, never been to Iceland.

01:39:34.093 --> 01:39:37.888
I mean, I've seen it, few times
from plane windows, but...

01:39:37.889 --> 01:39:39.306
Thank you.

01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:41.266
For what?

01:39:41.267 --> 01:39:44.596
You stood by me, even
after all that happened.

01:39:45.521 --> 01:39:46.563
Why?

01:39:46.564 --> 01:39:48.107
You're a good man.

01:39:48.399 --> 01:39:51.102
I bet your daughter would
have been proud of you.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.733
Thanks, ma'am.

01:40:00.495 --> 01:40:01.578
So...

01:40:01.579 --> 01:40:02.780
Mm-hm.

01:40:03.539 --> 01:40:04.956
Where you headed?

01:40:08.252 --> 01:40:09.999
Depends.
