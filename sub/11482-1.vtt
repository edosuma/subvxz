00:26.287 --> 00:28.332
I believe in curses.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.421
My town is cursed,

00:30.465 --> 00:33.207
a curse that moves
from person to person.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.606
Can I have another beer?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.739
Before I moved
here, right after winning State,

00:43.782 --> 00:46.307
the school's best and brightest get
in a van and head to the after-party.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.573
Riding along inside
one of them...

00:51.616 --> 00:52.661
the curse.

00:55.577 --> 00:56.752
Then the curse found a new home.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.669
Watch me.
Wait, what are you doing?

01:00.712 --> 01:02.453
The prom king.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.244
When I was a freshmen,
the curse found my sister.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.812
And when she broke up
with her boyfriend,

01:13.856 --> 01:15.945
just a regular
high school break up,

01:15.988 --> 01:17.251
the kind that everyone
goes through...

01:18.817 --> 01:20.471
that's when the curse came out.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.038
Her boyfriend gets really mad.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.562
He hits her.

01:26.869 --> 01:28.827
But that's not enough for him.

01:28.871 --> 01:31.003
He wants real revenge.

02:18.007 --> 02:18.834
Dad!

02:20.052 --> 02:21.228
Dad, wake up.

02:22.359 --> 02:23.534
Daddy?

02:27.930 --> 02:30.280
Mike, what are you doing?

02:30.324 --> 02:32.326
No, Mike.
Don't. You can't hurt me.

02:34.589 --> 02:35.764
Dad!

02:37.331 --> 02:39.333
Girls?

02:42.510 --> 02:44.033
Hey, Mike.

02:49.734 --> 02:52.389
Cindy! No!

02:52.433 --> 02:54.086
No!

02:54.130 --> 02:56.872
No! My baby!

02:56.915 --> 02:59.048
My baby!

03:07.230 --> 03:09.667
Then the curse moved again.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.408
I felt it.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.369
I feel it.

03:20.156 --> 03:22.724
Maybe no one else at my high
school knows, but I know.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.944
It's here...

03:25.988 --> 03:27.381
waiting.

03:36.172 --> 03:39.175
Ellie, hey!

03:39.219 --> 03:41.699
Oh my God, you missed it.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.572
Creepy Ben went psycho on Miss Higgins
when she called him out for being late.

03:44.615 --> 03:47.183
It was insane.
Wow, sorry I missed it.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.011
Wow, bitch much?

03:49.054 --> 03:50.752
Uh-oh, incoming.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.234
Hey, Ben.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.586
Can I talk to you?

03:58.629 --> 04:01.066
Uh, I've got practice.

04:01.110 --> 04:03.286
And then homework, and...

04:03.330 --> 04:05.375
I'm gonna be pretty tired later.

04:05.419 --> 04:08.160
So...

04:08.204 --> 04:10.032
maybe tomorrow
before third period?

04:11.294 --> 04:12.861
Is everything okay here?

04:12.904 --> 04:14.471
Yeah, right?

04:14.515 --> 04:15.994
Yeah.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.956
Ben, weren't you headed
to the principal's office?

04:22.871 --> 04:23.872
Ben.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.004
No.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.271
Thanks, Coach Reeves.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.142
It's no problem.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.797
You ladies have yourself
a good practice.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.494
The team's going to need all
the help we can get tomorrow.

04:45.894 --> 04:48.331
"You girls have a good practice.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.942
Especially you, Morgan."

04:50.986 --> 04:52.204
Oh my God.
This again?

04:52.248 --> 04:54.032
It did seem kind of...

04:54.076 --> 04:56.644
No, it's nothing. Stop.

04:56.687 --> 04:57.993
Oh, there's Nicholas.

04:58.036 --> 04:59.516
Making out with
your hot boyfriend

04:59.560 --> 05:01.431
is not a valid reason
to be late for practice.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.440
So, am I going
to see you tonight?

05:10.484 --> 05:11.876
Dee and I are going to Morgan's.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.443
We're going to cram
for the chem test.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.053
Oh, I see how it is.

05:15.097 --> 05:16.577
Choosing your friends
over me, okay.

05:16.620 --> 05:19.362
Well, just three
innocent cheerleaders

05:19.406 --> 05:21.190
all alone in a big house.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.931
No parents, pillow fights
in our underwear,

05:22.974 --> 05:24.889
talking about boys.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.891
Which boys?

05:26.935 --> 05:28.284
I'll never tell.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.199
You know, I could
just come over.

05:30.242 --> 05:31.766
I like innocent cheerleaders
in their underwear.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.202
Perv.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.596
Ellie, come on.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.381
I'd so rather stay
here with you...

05:38.425 --> 05:40.209
Nah, I've gotta go, too,

05:40.252 --> 05:42.472
and I'd be a terrible person
if I tried to lure you away.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.300
Oh, lure me.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.128
Go.
You are no fun.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.045
Bye.
Bye.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.491
Ready.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.058
Two, three, four.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.353
Hey.
Hey.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.667
Is your brain broken yet?

06:46.710 --> 06:48.973
Yeah, just about.

06:49.017 --> 06:51.889
You know, maybe I should just stay
here tonight and study on my own.

06:51.933 --> 06:54.414
Why is that?

06:54.457 --> 06:57.286
Because Morgan, Dee, and I can't seem to
get any studying done when we're together.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.244
You should go to Morgan's.
Mom.

06:59.288 --> 07:01.290
Ellie.
You'll be safe there.

07:01.333 --> 07:02.422
I know.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.381
But maybe I won't stay
the whole time.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.777
Are you sure you don't
need me here?

07:09.820 --> 07:12.780
I need you to be a 16-year-old girl
who wants to be away from her mother.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.436
Morgan's dad is gonna
be there, right?

07:16.479 --> 07:18.350
Yeah.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.657
Okay, well, go.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.398
Have fun.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.443
Life is short.

07:35.585 --> 07:38.196
I'm just saying that you should.
He's really fricking hot.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.633
Not saying a word.

07:39.676 --> 07:40.982
Unless you already have.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.331
Wait, have you?

07:42.374 --> 07:45.029
You slut.

07:45.073 --> 07:47.467
No, I haven't. God.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.730
You should.
It just makes sense.

07:49.773 --> 07:52.210
Even though Nicholas is new,
he's already, like,

07:52.254 --> 07:53.647
the king of the school.

07:53.690 --> 07:56.040
And you're at least
a duchess or something.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.825
"A duchess or something"?

07:57.868 --> 07:59.435
Wait, why is she not the queen?

08:00.697 --> 08:02.438
I'm the queen.
Oh.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.658
Well, not Nicholas' queen,
of course, but...

08:04.701 --> 08:06.181
I'm still the queen.

08:06.224 --> 08:09.227
The structure of this
aristocracy is confusing.

08:09.271 --> 08:12.100
Anyway, I think you
and he should just do

08:12.143 --> 08:13.971
what comes naturally.

08:14.015 --> 08:16.321
For the good of the kingdom.
Ugh, stop.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.541
I would totally do him
if I were you.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.369
Don't talk about
her man like that.

08:20.412 --> 08:23.633
She knows that I would
never lay a hand on him.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.679
It's not your hand
she's worried about.

08:25.722 --> 08:27.202
Ew.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.640
What about you, Morgan?

08:30.684 --> 08:31.946
Speaking of laying a hand
on somebody.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.471
What?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.732
You don't know
what I'm talking about?

08:36.777 --> 08:38.256
What are you talking about?

08:38.299 --> 08:39.562
You can't tell me
that you haven't noticed.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.085
Noticed what?

08:43.131 --> 08:44.261
What is this?

08:46.090 --> 08:47.657
I don't know.
It was in my room.

08:47.701 --> 08:48.963
My mom must have put it
there or something.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.880
Ellie, how can you not know
what I'm talking about?

08:52.923 --> 08:54.969
Shut up.

08:55.012 --> 08:57.537
Our little Morgan here has been getting
pretty cozy with Coach Reeves.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.495
Oh, that.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.105
Stop.
Is that really a thing?

09:01.149 --> 09:02.933
No, it's...
We have a...

09:04.413 --> 09:06.328
A connection.
A connection?

09:06.371 --> 09:07.547
Is that what you call it?

09:07.590 --> 09:09.157
Did you sext him?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.680
You totally sent him
Morgan porn.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.987
Why don't you go make out
with Creepy Ben again.

09:13.030 --> 09:15.729
Oh my God.
Again?

09:15.772 --> 09:17.208
Dee, you kissed Creepy Ben?

09:17.252 --> 09:19.733
More than once.
More than once?

09:19.776 --> 09:21.865
I was drunk.

09:21.909 --> 09:23.867
Both times.
It was a huge mistake,

09:23.911 --> 09:25.434
and I never want to talk
about it again.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.610
At least I'm not
screwing the coach.

09:27.654 --> 09:30.526
I'm not either. Okay, we'll get back
to your Bencounters in a minute.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.094
But first, did Coach
Reeves touch you?

09:33.137 --> 09:34.965
No, it's not like that.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.054
What was it like when
he didn't touch you?

09:37.098 --> 09:38.795
Stop.
You do like older guys.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.537
That's true. Clearly
she has daddy issues.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.756
Well, at least I have a dad.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.067
I'm sorry.

09:52.635 --> 09:53.680
I'm gonna go.

09:56.944 --> 09:59.033
What the hell?

09:59.076 --> 10:00.643
Ellie, I'm really sorry.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.992
No, I know.
I just want to be alone.

10:06.562 --> 10:07.650
Ellie, come on.

10:49.257 --> 10:50.562
I'm gonna shower.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.521
All right, I'm gonna
do this homework.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.019
Good morning, class.

11:13.411 --> 11:16.414
Okay, notes away.

11:16.458 --> 11:17.589
It's test time.

11:18.982 --> 11:21.028
And I've decided to give
you guys a break

11:21.071 --> 11:23.117
and make it multiple choice.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.771
Hey, you've reached Dee.
Make me laugh.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.904
Okay, this is insane.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.514
Dee and Morgan
dumping out on us?

11:29.558 --> 11:32.213
I just tried them again
for, like, the hundredth time.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.041
Who's going to lead
with Dee gone?

11:35.738 --> 11:37.479
You take it, Ellie.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.787
Okay.

11:40.830 --> 11:41.918
Let's try not to suck.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.272
So, boss.
One sec.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.451
Hey.
Hey.

11:53.495 --> 11:54.801
Morgan and Dee show?

11:54.844 --> 11:56.367
No, not yet.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.804
Why are you surprised?

11:57.847 --> 11:59.457
Morgan is a flake.

11:59.501 --> 12:02.765
Not when it comes to cheer.
Yeah.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.333
Nicholas, I know she is cute, but
can we save it for later, please?

12:05.376 --> 12:07.204
Thank you. Focus.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.948
You're down
a few girls today, huh?

12:11.992 --> 12:14.168
Yeah, I was...
Any idea where they might be?

12:15.822 --> 12:17.301
I was actually gonna ask you.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.782
Why would I know?

12:20.957 --> 12:22.916
I know you and Morgan are...

12:22.959 --> 12:26.093
What? What about Morgan?

12:26.136 --> 12:28.095
Nothing, I just know
you guys are close.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.749
I like everybody
on your team, Ellie.

Hey, Nick.
Hi, Dad.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.369
You know, you really
played great out there.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.893
You almost pulled it off
in that final drive.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.460
Yeah, I guess.

14:12.503 --> 14:13.983
Hey, give me a sec, all right?

14:15.115 --> 14:16.725
Hey, why the rush?

14:16.768 --> 14:18.074
Something's up.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.511
I can't believe
they didn't show.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.426
And why didn't they
answer my texts?

14:22.470 --> 14:23.775
I'm sure they're fine.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.908
Yeah, well, they better
be dead, pregnant,

14:25.952 --> 14:27.388
or in the hospital,
or all of the above.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.913
Look, my dad is over there.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.480
Let us give you a ride home.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.221
We can hang.

14:34.264 --> 14:35.875
No, I can't.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.311
I gotta go find out
where they are.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.277
Morgan?

15:59.132 --> 16:00.960
Oh my God.

16:10.273 --> 16:17.411
911, what's your emergency?

16:20.501 --> 16:22.285
I don't know, maybe 9:00?

16:22.329 --> 16:23.983
Did you see anybody
when you left?

16:25.810 --> 16:27.551
You sure?

16:27.595 --> 16:29.466
I know this is hard for you,
with all you've been through,

16:29.510 --> 16:31.642
but I need you to try
and remember.

16:31.686 --> 16:34.645
Was there a plan for anyone else to
come over, maybe guys from the team?

16:34.689 --> 16:36.212
No.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.127
No, why would someone take them?

16:38.171 --> 16:39.737
We're gonna find your friends.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.395
Oh my God, Ellie.

16:45.439 --> 16:46.962
Oh God, thank God you're okay.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.485
Hi, Jane.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.183
Pete, God.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.273
Their parents, Dee's mom,

16:53.316 --> 16:54.752
are they here?
Do they know?

16:54.796 --> 16:56.189
Dee's mom is at the station.

16:56.232 --> 16:57.929
Ellie was very lucky
to have left when she did.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.111
Hank. Hank.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.895
You can't go in there.
It's a crime scene.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.330
Pete, what's going on.
Where's my daughter?

17:08.375 --> 17:10.029
Hey, she's not here.
Neither is Dee.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.421
Morgan!
Just calm down.

17:11.464 --> 17:12.553
Hank, come on.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.730
Ellie.

17:15.772 --> 17:16.948
What did she say?

17:16.992 --> 17:18.472
Hank...

17:18.515 --> 17:19.690
Jane, please.
She was here...

17:19.733 --> 17:21.257
I'm sorry, I have
to get her home.

17:22.650 --> 17:23.912
I'm sorry.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.308
Take it easy.
Come on.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.420
You better get some of
this before I eat it all.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.206
I'm good.
You sure?

17:59.948 --> 18:01.210
What are you doing here?

18:07.260 --> 18:09.088
Dad, I'm afraid.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.527
You do not want
to look out there.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.720
Honey?

18:35.375 --> 18:37.942
Ellie?

18:37.986 --> 18:39.944
Maybe it's better if
you stay home today.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.685
They'll understand.
No.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.602
Honey, we've been through
this kind of thing.

18:45.646 --> 18:47.256
I'm gonna go.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.562
I wanna go.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.303
Fine, then I'll drive you.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.000
I told Nicholas I'd go with him.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.741
And you told me Morgan's dad
was going to be home.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.310
I... thought he would be.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.207
Oh, you can call me Don.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.296
Okay, Don.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.039
Ellie, I am just...

19:31.082 --> 19:32.997
I'm just so sorry about
everything that's been happening.

19:33.041 --> 19:35.174
Dad, come on. I don't think
she wants to talk about that.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.741
No, it's okay. I know
everyone is thinking about it

19:37.785 --> 19:40.396
and what happened to me.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.877
Well, if there's anything
that I can do for you,

19:42.920 --> 19:43.921
or for your mom.

20:23.831 --> 20:25.354
This is so messed up.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.184
I mean, I can't stop
thinking about it.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.925
You were almost
there that night.

20:32.579 --> 20:35.277
It's my fault.
No, don't say that.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.932
Before my family moved here,
stuff like this didn't happen.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.245
Why'd you leave Morgan's house?

20:48.508 --> 20:51.250
I mean, I'm sure
you had a reason.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.816
Everybody wants to know.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.296
Did they nominate you
to find out?

20:54.340 --> 20:55.602
Ellie, come on.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.259
I left because...

21:01.390 --> 21:03.349
Morgan...

21:03.392 --> 21:04.872
We had a fight.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.830
It was stupid. I don't
want to talk about it.

21:11.574 --> 21:12.706
Okay.

21:14.795 --> 21:17.319
Sorry.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.060
Attention, all students.

21:19.103 --> 21:21.802
Please return to your
homerooms immediately.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.587
What's that about?
I don't know.

21:29.505 --> 21:30.854
Miss Taylor, what happened?

21:32.508 --> 21:35.119
Um...

21:35.163 --> 21:37.383
They...

21:37.426 --> 21:38.819
Well, what is it?
They found...

21:40.124 --> 21:41.387
Morgan's...

21:41.430 --> 21:42.475
body.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.219
What do we do?
Do we go home?

21:48.263 --> 21:49.699
Well, what about Dee?
Where's Dee?

21:51.005 --> 21:53.050
I... They don't know.

21:53.094 --> 21:56.489
All students,
immediately return to your homeroom

21:56.532 --> 21:58.447
until further notice.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.493
Get me out of here, please.

22:00.536 --> 22:01.842
Wait, Ellie.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.455
I made this happen.

22:06.499 --> 22:09.023
Of course you didn't.
I did, I know I did.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.764
Ellie, stop.

22:10.807 --> 22:12.853
I got in a fight with Morgan,
I left, and now she's dead.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.769
Probably Dee too.

22:15.812 --> 22:18.380
No, Dee could still be okay.

22:18.424 --> 22:19.947
No, they won't find her.

22:21.209 --> 22:22.950
Honey...

22:22.993 --> 22:25.300
whatever happens, okay,

22:25.344 --> 22:27.302
you didn't cause this.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.521
Stop thinking that.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.917
I let that happen.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.228
I can't keep doing this, Ellie.

22:40.271 --> 22:41.534
I can't.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.538
I'm gonna go make us some tea.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.502
Mom!

22:55.461 --> 22:57.071
Mom!

22:57.114 --> 22:58.681
And neither one of you
brought this in the house?

23:00.030 --> 23:01.684
Morgan had one

23:01.728 --> 23:02.946
in her room that night.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.863
We're gonna figure this out.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.822
Pete, we can't stay here.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.214
We're not safe.

23:10.258 --> 23:12.042
I'm gonna have an officer
watch the house.

23:12.086 --> 23:15.306
No one is going to be able
to get near you, I promise.

23:15.350 --> 23:16.917
But I need you to bring
Ellie to the station.

23:18.048 --> 23:19.485
Now?
Yes.

23:21.791 --> 23:23.924
I'll go ahead and call down there
and let them know you're coming.

23:43.639 --> 23:44.945
Would you be Ellie Davis?

23:44.988 --> 23:46.468
Yeah.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.775
Special Agent
Ramon Martinez, FBI.

23:48.818 --> 23:50.603
I'm Jane, Ellie's mom.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.605
Would you mind if we ask Ellie
a few questions in private?

23:54.171 --> 23:56.173
I'd rather be...
It won't take long.

23:56.217 --> 23:57.871
We'll get you home in time
for a good night's sleep.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.222
Go ahead.
Thank you.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.397
Right this way.

24:05.835 --> 24:08.577
We're in the process of
compiling information, Coach Reeves.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.492
And we're fortunate to be
partnering with the FBI.

24:11.754 --> 24:14.148
Hang on just one second.
Hi, Ellie.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.541
Why don't you wait by my desk.

24:15.584 --> 24:17.368
Agent Martinez, I need you in here.
Okay.

24:18.935 --> 24:21.155
Okay, if you wouldn't mind
taking a seat.

24:21.198 --> 24:22.461
Be right back, thanks.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.164
Nice.

24:57.583 --> 25:00.673
The kidnapping has already
resulted in one homicide.

25:00.716 --> 25:03.284
The homicide of one young
Morgan Wheeler.

25:03.327 --> 25:05.068
You're familiar
with her, aren't you?

25:05.112 --> 25:08.985
Yeah, Morgan and
I exchanged texts on occasion.

25:10.857 --> 25:12.946
How about 87 separate occasions?

25:12.989 --> 25:15.078
I was responding.

25:15.122 --> 25:17.298
I thought it was rude
to just ignore her.

25:17.341 --> 25:20.736
You don't want to
be rude to a 17-year-old girl

25:20.780 --> 25:22.869
when you're the high school
football coach.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.697
Nicky, why don't you
make sure Ellie's comfortable.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.612
I resent the implication.

25:42.932 --> 25:44.630
Ellie.

25:45.761 --> 25:47.546
Yeah?

25:47.589 --> 25:49.635
Sorry you had to wait. Just a
couple of quick questions.

25:49.678 --> 25:51.288
Okay.

25:51.332 --> 25:53.900
Did Morgan mention anything
about Coach Reeves?

25:53.943 --> 25:55.815
Like what?

25:55.858 --> 25:57.599
Connecting outside school?

25:58.818 --> 26:00.515
No.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.474
She had a crush on him.
We'd joke around about it.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.172
We?
Yeah, me and Dee.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.347
And what did Morgan say?

26:06.390 --> 26:08.479
She denied it.

26:08.523 --> 26:11.570
We were just being silly.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.963
I did see Coach Reeves at her
locker that night, after the game.

26:15.269 --> 26:16.662
Only, he didn't take anything.

26:18.838 --> 26:20.448
What are you doing about Dee?

26:20.491 --> 26:21.797
Everything we can, Ellie.

26:21.841 --> 26:23.625
Like what, though?
Are you even looking?

26:23.669 --> 26:26.193
We won't stop looking
until we find her.

26:26.236 --> 26:27.760
I promise.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.285
Okay, Ellie.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.467
Hey. All done?
Yeah.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.684
And I heard her body parts
were spread out over, like, a mile

27:22.728 --> 27:24.860
along the side of the road.

27:24.904 --> 27:27.341
God, somebody just threw
her away like that?

27:27.384 --> 27:28.777
Out of a car window,
or something.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.913
Oh, hey, Ellie.

27:33.956 --> 27:36.742
How are you?
Really sorry about your friends.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.094
Hey.

27:41.137 --> 27:42.573
What were you doing
there that night?

27:42.617 --> 27:44.445
What was I doing where?
At Morgan's.

27:44.488 --> 27:46.534
I saw you on the street,
in the crowd.

27:46.577 --> 27:49.493
What were you doing there?
Trying to find my friends.

27:49.537 --> 27:51.931
Hey.
Don't you ever touch me again, or I...

27:51.974 --> 27:55.282
You'll what? You'll kill me?

27:55.325 --> 27:58.415
What were you doing there? You
don't live anywhere near Morgan.

27:58.459 --> 28:02.245
Gee, Officer. I think I
should talk to my lawyer.

28:02.289 --> 28:03.682
What if I tell
the police I saw you?

28:05.074 --> 28:07.729
Go ahead, tell them.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.731
I wasn't hat Morgan's that night.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.778
And about what
you think you saw,

28:12.821 --> 28:15.432
everyone knows you're
a crazy bitch with PTSD.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.294
Ellie, there you are.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.517
I miss them.
Me too.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.303
Are you scared?

29:00.347 --> 29:03.219
They should have caught
whoever it is by now.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.308
It's been three days.
If they did that to Morgan,

29:05.352 --> 29:06.570
what are they going
to do to Dee?

29:08.398 --> 29:10.400
Remember last year at State,

29:10.444 --> 29:13.403
when that crazy girl got in Dee's
face and she just shut her down?

29:13.447 --> 29:17.843
Yeah, and the best part was,
we kicked their ass.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.497
The last thing Dee would want
is for us to give up on her.

29:20.541 --> 29:21.672
Yeah.

29:39.778 --> 29:45.435
<i>♪ You look so lovely tonight ♪</i>

29:45.479 --> 29:49.048
<i>♪ You're breaking up
like a dying satellite ♪</i>

29:52.878 --> 29:54.836
<i>♪ Atmosphere so bright ♪</i>

29:56.882 --> 29:59.014
You scared the crap out of me.

29:59.058 --> 30:01.495
I had to see you.
How did you get around the cops?

30:02.888 --> 30:04.672
Patience.

30:10.721 --> 30:14.421
You okay?
I'm just thinking about everything.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.249
Morgan, Dee...

30:16.292 --> 30:17.946
us.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.166
Yeah?
What about us?

30:22.429 --> 30:24.257
I don't know, there's
just a lot going on.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.259
I know.

30:26.302 --> 30:27.564
We need a distraction.

30:27.608 --> 30:30.654
Maybe... I should just...

30:30.698 --> 30:32.961
focus on my stuff and
let you focus on yours.

30:35.007 --> 30:37.270
Focus on your stuff?
What does that mean?

30:37.313 --> 30:39.620
Look, I don't think
you should be around me.

30:39.663 --> 30:42.275
For your own safety.

30:42.318 --> 30:45.931
Being with you is the first thing, in a
long time, that's made me feel normal.

30:45.974 --> 30:48.368
Look, I just need you to give
me a second to figure this out.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.459
Wow.

30:52.502 --> 30:54.635
Okay.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.855
Thanks so much for pulling away
exactly when we need each other most.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.987
Okay, wait.
That came out wrong.

30:59.031 --> 31:01.033
You don't have to go.
Enjoy your space.

31:01.076 --> 31:04.775
<i>♪ Do things that you
want me to do ♪</i>

31:07.213 --> 31:11.434
<i>♪ Staring out into
the midnight blue ♪</i>

31:19.529 --> 31:20.879
Hey, Ellie.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.536
You know, out of all the students, this
has got to be the toughest for you.

31:28.234 --> 31:30.584
Okay.

31:30.627 --> 31:34.066
Look, I know you saw me
at the police station.

31:34.109 --> 31:36.807
I don't know what you think was
going on between me and Morgan,

31:36.851 --> 31:39.332
but I would never hurt her.

31:39.375 --> 31:40.899
Was there something going
on with you and Morgan?

31:41.987 --> 31:43.771
Of course not.

31:43.814 --> 31:45.120
Then why were you at her locker?

31:48.558 --> 31:50.909
The police were satisfied
with what I told them,

31:50.952 --> 31:52.823
and I hope you are too.

31:56.044 --> 31:58.046
I get it.

31:58.090 --> 31:59.526
I'm going to be late for class.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.136
Okay.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.616
Hey.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.271
Let's hope they find Dee soon.

32:30.687 --> 32:32.820
It's only been the cheerleaders.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.691
They must be, like, obsessed.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.824
The one time it
pays to not be popular.

32:36.867 --> 32:38.608
And I heard they
had to do things.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.959
Like, sexual things.

32:41.002 --> 32:43.439
Dee must be so
freaked out right now.

32:43.483 --> 32:44.658
If she's even alive.

32:44.701 --> 32:45.789
Where did you hear that stuff?

32:45.833 --> 32:47.095
I just...
Where?

32:47.139 --> 32:48.314
Where did you hear it?

32:48.357 --> 32:50.446
Just stop, okay.
Nobody knows anything.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.144
She was just talking...
Just shut up, okay!

32:52.187 --> 32:54.015
Even if you did hear something,
and I know you didn't,

32:54.059 --> 32:55.234
keep it to yourself!
Ellie.

32:55.277 --> 32:56.844
That's enough.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.674
Go to class, all of you.

33:18.561 --> 33:20.085
Hello?

33:21.477 --> 33:25.003
No, no, he's always been kind.

33:25.046 --> 33:28.180
He wouldn't hold anything
back about Dee, I'm sure of it.

33:28.223 --> 33:29.833
I know Jane.
Chief Patterson?

33:29.877 --> 33:32.010
I think he has to ask.

33:34.490 --> 33:36.623
Last night was awful.
Mom?

33:47.155 --> 33:48.548
You shouldn't have
brought that here.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.301
Please.

34:02.344 --> 34:04.085
I'm so scared.

34:29.676 --> 34:30.719
Ellie?

34:33.636 --> 34:35.333
How do you know when
it's time to share a secret?

34:37.161 --> 34:39.077
Would you like to tell
me something?

34:39.120 --> 34:41.469
Well, how do you know? Are
there, like, rules or something?

34:44.255 --> 34:48.042
I suppose if people are getting
hurt, that would be a time.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.175
Okay, but what if you
don't know that for sure?

34:52.177 --> 34:53.569
What would make someone
do what they did to Morgan?

34:56.442 --> 34:57.530
I don't know.

34:58.748 --> 34:59.880
Evil.

35:12.458 --> 35:13.850
You like him.

35:16.157 --> 35:18.246
Oh, Coach Reeves and I
work together.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.987
But you like him,
and you're married.

35:23.295 --> 35:25.123
Please don't say anything.

35:25.166 --> 35:27.429
Morgan knew about
you guys, didn't she?

35:27.473 --> 35:29.170
That was her
Coach Reeve's secret.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.519
No one else knows.

35:31.955 --> 35:33.174
I gotta go.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.176
Ellie?
I won't tell.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.308
Ellie.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.365
So in 1803...
Hey, Nicholas.

35:50.409 --> 35:54.064
When Jefferson closed
the deal with Napoleon,

35:54.108 --> 35:56.328
and purchased Louisiana.

35:57.938 --> 35:59.853
Mr. Ryder?

35:59.896 --> 36:01.289
Class has already begun.

36:06.468 --> 36:10.820
Listen, what's happening
is so messed up,

36:10.864 --> 36:12.387
but we can't let this
tear us apart.

36:13.910 --> 36:14.998
I need you with me.

36:16.304 --> 36:17.479
I want you with me.

36:18.654 --> 36:20.439
Yeah?
Yeah.

36:23.442 --> 36:24.834
I have to show you something.

36:24.878 --> 36:25.922
Okay.

36:28.447 --> 36:29.839
Wait, where is it?

36:29.883 --> 36:31.276
What? What is it?

36:31.319 --> 36:32.712
No, someone left
a note in my locker.

36:32.755 --> 36:34.714
Hey, hey, calm down.
No, you don't understand.

36:34.757 --> 36:36.237
You have to see it.
Someone took it.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.021
He took it back.
Ellie, stop. What did it say?

36:39.588 --> 36:40.894
They're after me, Nicholas.

36:40.937 --> 36:42.374
They know me.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.232
Ellie, what is it?

37:17.452 --> 37:18.714
Oh my God.

37:20.063 --> 37:22.109
None prior to this one?
No.

37:22.152 --> 37:24.242
Any other communication?

37:24.285 --> 37:25.852
There was a note.

37:25.895 --> 37:27.332
Do you have it?

37:27.375 --> 37:29.290
I lost it,

37:29.334 --> 37:31.379
or whoever wrote it stole
it back out of my backpack.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.773
What did it say?

37:33.816 --> 37:36.079
Just threats about breaking into my house
and not saying anything to anyone.

37:36.123 --> 37:37.559
Where did you find it?

37:37.603 --> 37:39.300
My locker at school,
this morning.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.259
What are you going
to do about this?

37:41.302 --> 37:43.522
We'll need to keep the phone,
sorry, Ellie.

37:43.565 --> 37:44.827
Run some searches.

37:46.394 --> 37:48.222
Unfortunately there are
a lot of people out there

37:48.266 --> 37:49.963
that know just enough
to do this kind of thing.

37:50.006 --> 37:51.747
I wouldn't worry about it.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.271
How can I not worry about this?

37:53.314 --> 37:55.011
What about Ben Forester?

37:55.055 --> 37:57.144
He was at Morgan's house
that night you were there.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.928
I saw him in the crowd.

37:58.972 --> 38:00.539
We'll look into it.

38:00.582 --> 38:02.802
You don't believe me about Ben?

38:02.845 --> 38:05.805
What I need you to do now
is take Ellie home.

38:05.848 --> 38:07.328
Lay low.

38:07.372 --> 38:09.156
We've got surveillance
on the house.

38:09.199 --> 38:12.202
We'll update you as soon as
there is any new information.

38:12.246 --> 38:13.856
Okay, let's go, honey.
Come on.

38:26.391 --> 38:27.827
Mom, could I ask you something?

38:28.958 --> 38:31.352
What's up?

38:31.396 --> 38:32.701
Could you make
your chicken piccata tonight?

38:35.748 --> 38:37.619
Sure.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.491
Let's go to the store
and grab what we need.

38:39.534 --> 38:41.362
Actually, do you mind if I just stay here?
I'm kind of tired.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.670
Okay.

38:44.713 --> 38:46.149
I'll be right back.

40:02.051 --> 40:03.270
Who is it?

40:03.313 --> 40:05.054
A friend of Ben's.

40:05.098 --> 40:06.752
He doesn't have any friends.

40:06.795 --> 40:08.318
My name is Ellie.

40:12.192 --> 40:13.846
He's not here.
I know.

40:15.543 --> 40:17.763
What do you want?
Um...

40:17.806 --> 40:19.155
I'm a friend of Ben's.

40:19.199 --> 40:21.070
You said that.
What do you want?

40:21.114 --> 40:23.725
I was hoping I could just go in
his room and leave something.

40:23.769 --> 40:26.424
Is that what you were hoping?

40:26.467 --> 40:28.513
Yeah, we're in
sociology together.

40:28.556 --> 40:30.428
We're studying random
acts of kindness.

40:30.471 --> 40:32.473
And you wanted to surprise
Ben with something kind?

40:32.517 --> 40:33.953
Yeah.

40:33.996 --> 40:36.259
Get the hell out of here.

40:36.303 --> 40:39.567
What? You don't think I know how
you little bitches treat my kid?

40:39.611 --> 40:41.439
I know who you are.

40:41.482 --> 40:43.789
No cheerleader is ever
gonna do something for him.

40:43.832 --> 40:46.356
Okay, but...
And he's not taking sociology.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.097
Wait, please.
I'll call the cops.

41:17.736 --> 41:19.564
You gonna tell her
he didn't do nothing?

41:19.607 --> 41:21.304
Lynn, you stay where you are.

41:21.348 --> 41:23.568
What do you mean? He left
those things in our houses.

41:23.611 --> 41:25.221
He snuck in and left them.

41:25.265 --> 41:27.093
Yeah, I did, but I
didn't hurt anybody.

41:27.136 --> 41:29.443
Ben, you can wait until
you have a lawyer.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.751
Well, how do you know... We were out of
town the night those girls went missing.

41:32.794 --> 41:35.144
That's enough.
Three damn hours away.

41:35.188 --> 41:38.017
We were busy watching Ben's
grandma die, you little bitch.

41:38.060 --> 41:40.062
You get back on the porch,
your boy is in enough trouble.

41:40.106 --> 41:41.760
Don't make it worse.

41:41.803 --> 41:44.284
No, but why would he leave
those stupid, creepy statues?

41:44.327 --> 41:46.112
Because I wanted
you all to like me.

41:46.155 --> 41:47.766
You have no idea how hard it is

41:47.809 --> 41:49.332
to be on the outside
of everything.

41:49.376 --> 41:50.943
I know exactly what it's like,

41:50.986 --> 41:53.336
but I don't scare people by
breaking into their houses.

41:53.380 --> 41:55.687
I didn't mean...
And I don't leave notes in their locker.

41:55.730 --> 41:57.906
I was afraid...
And I don't text threats to them.

41:57.950 --> 41:59.865
I didn't text you.

42:02.389 --> 42:04.609
Yeah, I wrote the note,
but I didn't text you.

42:06.175 --> 42:07.873
See?

42:09.265 --> 42:11.877
I took it back.
I'll take that.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.879
Go inside, Ben.

42:13.922 --> 42:15.141
Go on.

42:50.959 --> 42:53.092
Did it ever occur to you what might
have happened if he were the killer?

42:53.135 --> 42:54.528
He's not the killer, Mom.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.617
What the hell were you
thinking, Ellie?

42:56.661 --> 42:58.663
When I got that call...
Why is no one looking for Dee?

42:58.706 --> 43:00.752
She's still out there.

43:00.795 --> 43:03.232
I know you think you're
helping, but you need to stop.

43:03.276 --> 43:04.973
Well, somebody
has to do something.

43:05.017 --> 43:07.106
What happened is not your fault.

43:07.149 --> 43:09.108
Not what happened
to your dad, your sister,

43:09.151 --> 43:10.631
not Morgan and Dee, none of it.

43:10.675 --> 43:12.764
You say somebody needs
to do something,

43:12.807 --> 43:15.418
they are, the cops
are doing something.

43:15.462 --> 43:17.072
It's not your job to fix this, Ellie.
It's not.

43:18.987 --> 43:20.423
And I can't lose you too.

43:28.910 --> 43:31.391
Have a good evening, ma'am.
Thank you.

43:45.274 --> 43:48.060
Ellie! Stace, please
don't lecture me.

43:48.103 --> 43:50.584
I wasn't going to.
Sorry, everyone else is.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.804
Did you really citizen's
arrest Creepy Ben?

43:52.847 --> 43:54.544
No, I was wrong about him.

43:54.588 --> 43:56.503
Whatever, at least
you did something.

43:56.546 --> 43:58.766
Not really.

43:58.810 --> 44:00.942
Even if he's not guilty of, you know,
he's gotta be guilty of something.

44:00.986 --> 44:02.422
I gotta go.

44:07.862 --> 44:08.994
Hey.
Hey.

44:10.473 --> 44:12.040
Why haven't you been
answering my calls?

44:12.084 --> 44:13.563
The cops took my phone.

44:13.607 --> 44:15.174
Why?

44:15.217 --> 44:16.523
I got a text.

44:16.566 --> 44:18.177
A threat.

44:18.220 --> 44:21.049
Ben? No, no, he's weird,
but he's not the killer.

44:22.311 --> 44:23.399
You just need to be careful.

44:24.531 --> 44:25.793
I miss you.

44:25.837 --> 44:27.534
I only see you at school now.

44:27.577 --> 44:30.015
I know, it's... complicated.

44:30.058 --> 44:32.713
Yeah? Well, they made a
memorial for Morgan,

44:32.757 --> 44:34.410
where they found her body.

44:34.454 --> 44:36.325
Maybe we should go together.

44:36.369 --> 44:37.892
Yeah, maybe.

44:37.936 --> 44:39.415
I think it would
be good for you.

44:42.941 --> 44:44.507
Bleachers, after school?

44:44.551 --> 44:45.639
Sure.

44:52.864 --> 44:54.430
Hey, Stace, can I
borrow your phone?

44:54.474 --> 44:55.693
Sure.

45:02.482 --> 45:04.745
Hey, Mom.
Ellie? Is everything okay?

45:04.789 --> 45:06.921
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm just at practice.

45:06.965 --> 45:08.401
I borrowed Stacy's phone.

45:08.444 --> 45:09.837
Okay.

45:09.881 --> 45:11.752
I was wondering if
I could borrow your car.

45:11.796 --> 45:13.449
Why?

45:13.493 --> 45:15.016
To go to Morgan's memorial.

45:15.060 --> 45:16.452
No, not by yourself.

45:16.496 --> 45:18.933
No, I know, Mom. I'm
not going to go alone.

45:18.977 --> 45:21.196
Who are you going with?
With Nicholas.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.721
Be careful.
Cool, bye.

45:36.037 --> 45:37.256
Thanks, Stace.

46:02.672 --> 46:03.891
You guys, it's Ellie.

46:16.556 --> 46:17.818
Hi, Morgs.

46:22.518 --> 46:23.868
I'm so sorry.

46:26.044 --> 46:28.655
Ellie.
Oh, hi, Mr. Wheeler.

46:30.831 --> 46:32.050
Sorry about what?

46:34.095 --> 46:35.749
She was my friend,
and I'm sorry...

46:36.837 --> 46:37.969
for her...

46:38.012 --> 46:39.666
for you.

46:41.494 --> 46:42.625
You're lucky.

46:45.585 --> 46:47.065
You're lucky you
decided to go home, eh?

46:55.508 --> 46:57.162
You really shouldn't
be out here alone, Ellie.

47:09.478 --> 47:11.176
Please let him be gone.

51:30.609 --> 51:32.089
Hello?

51:34.003 --> 51:35.222
Dee!

51:39.183 --> 51:41.837
Oh my God, thank you.
Thank you.

51:41.881 --> 51:43.274
You're gonna be all right, okay?

51:43.317 --> 51:46.538
He killed her.
He killed Morgan.

51:46.581 --> 51:48.322
Who? Who killed her?

51:48.366 --> 51:50.933
I don't know.
I didn't see his face.

51:50.977 --> 51:53.893
He said he'd kill me too.

51:53.936 --> 51:56.635
No, he's not.
He did things, Ellie.

51:56.678 --> 51:57.984
He's not going
to kill you, okay?

51:58.027 --> 52:00.160
Help me untie your feet.

52:00.204 --> 52:01.466
No, help me.

52:02.989 --> 52:04.033
Come on, help me.

52:18.918 --> 52:20.615
Oh my God.

52:23.705 --> 52:25.403
We're dead.
Come on, I need you to move.

52:25.446 --> 52:26.665
Come on.

52:43.943 --> 52:45.336
Okay, come on.

52:45.379 --> 52:46.337
Okay, okay, okay...

52:47.642 --> 52:48.948
Go, go, go.

52:50.776 --> 52:51.864
Ellie, hurry!

53:02.744 --> 53:04.311
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go.

53:12.232 --> 53:13.842
Come on.

53:13.886 --> 53:15.322
My car is down the hill. Run!

53:29.902 --> 53:31.208
Hurry, Dee.
This way.

53:33.297 --> 53:34.689
I can't make it, Ellie.

54:09.333 --> 54:10.508
Come on.

54:10.551 --> 54:11.813
Listen.

54:14.120 --> 54:15.948
Dee, we have to split up.

54:15.991 --> 54:17.515
I'll lead him away from you.

54:17.558 --> 54:19.038
Run!

54:19.081 --> 54:20.431
Meet me at the car!

54:27.307 --> 54:28.613
Leave her alone!

54:51.244 --> 54:52.419
Oh my God, Dee. Come on.

54:58.817 --> 55:00.645
Look out, Dee!

55:26.671 --> 55:27.846
Thank you.

55:29.848 --> 55:31.502
Ellie, are you sure
you didn't recognize him?

55:33.112 --> 55:34.679
We've already been through this.

55:34.722 --> 55:36.724
She couldn't see his face.

55:36.768 --> 55:39.161
Have you been able to find out
whose building it is?

55:39.205 --> 55:41.120
The property's deed is known.
We're checking.

55:41.163 --> 55:43.340
We already have tissue
from under Morgan's nails

55:43.383 --> 55:44.993
and now Dee's.
Come on, Ramon.

55:45.037 --> 55:46.386
They don't need to hear this.

55:46.430 --> 55:48.170
It's okay.
I want to know.

55:49.563 --> 55:51.783
So you didn't
recognize his voice?

55:51.826 --> 55:53.698
Why would she
recognize his voice?

55:53.741 --> 55:55.874
Honey, what were you thinking,
going after that car?

55:57.963 --> 55:59.268
You should have come to us.

55:59.312 --> 56:01.358
Come to you?

56:01.401 --> 56:02.968
You haven't been able
to do anything.

56:05.231 --> 56:06.319
We're leaving town.

56:06.363 --> 56:07.755
We can't allow you to do that.

56:07.799 --> 56:09.148
Ellie is a witness.

56:09.191 --> 56:11.193
I have to keep my daughter safe.

56:11.237 --> 56:14.066
And the best way to do that is to
let us continue our surveillance.

56:14.109 --> 56:16.198
Keep Ellie home from school.

56:16.242 --> 56:19.419
Contain her movements, because she
can't be counted on to do it herself.

56:19.463 --> 56:20.768
I found Dee.

56:20.812 --> 56:22.422
Yes.

56:22.466 --> 56:25.382
And now she's dead.

56:25.425 --> 56:28.123
That's it, we're going.
I'll have a patrol car take you home.

56:28.167 --> 56:30.387
We need to run forensics
on your car.

56:30.430 --> 56:31.779
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

56:31.823 --> 56:33.912
Ellie...

56:33.955 --> 56:35.217
thank you for
letting us use this.

56:36.610 --> 56:38.220
Let's go.

57:07.467 --> 57:09.121
All the guys on
the team signed it for you.

57:09.164 --> 57:10.470
Everybody's thinking about you.

57:13.430 --> 57:15.257
Thanks, that's really nice.

57:21.133 --> 57:22.656
Whoa.

57:22.700 --> 57:24.441
Your mom?

57:27.095 --> 57:28.401
Hey.

57:28.445 --> 57:29.533
Ellie.

57:32.536 --> 57:34.538
Ellie.
Let's get out of here.

57:37.454 --> 57:39.281
Like, to town?

57:39.325 --> 57:41.109
Just get in your car, drive
away, and not come back.

57:42.197 --> 57:43.808
Really?

57:43.851 --> 57:46.071
You're the only one
who understands me, right?

57:51.772 --> 57:52.817
Right?

57:53.905 --> 57:54.993
What?

57:57.212 --> 57:58.736
Why did you bail on me that day?

58:01.216 --> 58:03.523
I should have been with you
at Morgan's memorial.

58:03.567 --> 58:04.872
So what?

58:04.916 --> 58:06.265
You could protect me?
Yeah.

58:06.308 --> 58:08.093
Thank God you weren't there.

58:08.136 --> 58:09.921
If something happened
to you too, I'd...

58:09.964 --> 58:11.531
Look, I'm sure people
would really care.

58:11.575 --> 58:12.837
Don't talk like that, okay?

58:13.925 --> 58:15.535
I need you.

58:15.579 --> 58:16.797
Your dad needs you.

58:19.583 --> 58:21.846
His life would be a lot
better if I wasn't around.

58:24.718 --> 58:27.286
Look, Ellie.

58:27.329 --> 58:29.114
I don't want to lose you.

58:31.159 --> 58:32.509
You're not gonna lose me.

58:34.598 --> 58:35.729
I'm right here.

58:37.775 --> 58:39.254
Just you and me.

58:49.613 --> 58:50.831
Wait, what is that?

58:54.226 --> 58:55.967
Oh, that's the car
that I followed.

58:56.010 --> 58:57.446
It took me to Dee.

58:59.797 --> 59:01.538
I... I have to go.

59:03.322 --> 59:04.671
Wait, what?

59:04.715 --> 59:05.759
It's starting again.

59:05.803 --> 59:07.108
Where are you going?

59:07.152 --> 59:10.198
It's not you, Ellie.

59:10.242 --> 59:11.417
I'm the one who is cursed.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.474
What was that all about?

59:25.518 --> 59:27.302
Nothing.

59:27.346 --> 59:29.435
You can't say that.

59:29.478 --> 59:30.697
Not now.

59:30.741 --> 59:32.133
Okay, is "I don't know" enough?

59:32.177 --> 59:34.962
Honey...

59:35.006 --> 59:37.748
you're a brave,
smart, kind girl.

59:37.791 --> 59:40.968
Mom. You don't ever need
to be chasing after a boy.

59:41.012 --> 59:42.666
If he's not being straight with you...
Stop.

59:44.755 --> 59:47.148
Hm, he's cute.

59:47.192 --> 59:48.628
He's a good football player.
Mom.

59:49.847 --> 59:51.109
Don't.

01:00:14.567 --> 01:00:16.482
Ellie?

01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:18.223
Ellie, come here.

01:00:24.142 --> 01:00:25.447
Have you seen my hat?

01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:26.840
You know, my good one.

01:00:28.537 --> 01:00:29.626
You're not really here, are you?

01:00:32.019 --> 01:00:33.368
It's right in front of you.

01:00:39.548 --> 01:00:41.246
It's always been
right in front of you,

01:00:41.289 --> 01:00:43.291
all along.

01:00:43.335 --> 01:00:45.946
You've got so much
blood on your hands.

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:47.295
Look.

01:01:01.179 --> 01:01:03.355
Ellie.

01:01:03.398 --> 01:01:05.444
What is this?

01:01:05.487 --> 01:01:06.837
I don't know.

01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:11.145
Pack your things, right now.

01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:27.335
Yeah, Bill?

01:01:27.379 --> 01:01:29.250
Her description
sounds like a Lincoln,

01:01:29.294 --> 01:01:32.297
and the tire tracks from
the bunkhouse are fresh.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:35.474
Get me the brand,
and we'll contact

01:01:35.517 --> 01:01:37.389
stores for recent customers.

01:01:37.432 --> 01:01:39.086
Okay, thanks, Bill.

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:48.095
We're going to run an immediate
triangulation on the phone.

01:01:48.139 --> 01:01:49.836
You can't stop this.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.533
It's part of the curse.

01:01:51.577 --> 01:01:54.449
Jane, we finished the
forensics on your car.

01:01:54.493 --> 01:01:56.713
Take it. I want you both
to get out of town.

01:01:56.756 --> 01:01:58.584
They can't just leave, not now.

01:01:58.627 --> 01:02:01.195
You take Ellie to your mom's
in Sacramento, you stay there.

01:02:01.239 --> 01:02:03.371
We're close.
We're already packed.

01:02:03.415 --> 01:02:05.547
Good.
I know where to find them.

01:02:13.642 --> 01:02:14.861
Mom, I have to say
bye to Nicholas.

01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:16.776
No.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.517
Please, we don't know how long
we're going to be gone for.

01:02:44.412 --> 01:02:46.371
I think Nicholas
is upstairs studying.

01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:50.375
Hey, Nick.
Ellie's here.

01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:52.464
We just have a minute.
Please, come in. Sit down.

01:02:53.987 --> 01:02:55.815
Can I get you something to eat?

01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:57.425
No, thank you.
We're fine.

01:02:57.469 --> 01:02:59.123
Is that okay if I
just go up and find him?

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:01.038
Oh, yeah, sure.
Okay.

01:03:01.081 --> 01:03:02.256
Please, sit down.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.568
Nicholas?

01:03:12.136 --> 01:03:13.137
You up here?

01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:47.127
Ellie?

01:03:47.171 --> 01:03:48.694
Hey.

01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:51.436
There you are.

01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:55.875
You okay?
Yeah.

01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:57.268
Um...

01:04:00.445 --> 01:04:03.143
I was just thinking
about what you said earlier,

01:04:03.187 --> 01:04:04.188
before you left.

01:04:07.147 --> 01:04:08.409
What are you doing here?

01:04:08.453 --> 01:04:10.237
I came to say goodbye.

01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:11.935
For now.
We're leaving.

01:04:15.068 --> 01:04:17.636
What if things weren't exactly
as you think they are?

01:04:19.333 --> 01:04:20.639
About me?

01:04:20.682 --> 01:04:21.988
Like how?

01:04:24.817 --> 01:04:26.036
Ellie.

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:44.837
What's going on, Chief?
Something happen?

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.361
We're clearing up some
loose ends in our investigation.

01:04:47.405 --> 01:04:49.668
Following up on some
recent purchases.

01:04:49.711 --> 01:04:51.278
You mind if we take
a look around?

01:04:54.194 --> 01:04:56.936
Of course.
Dad, Dad, no.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:59.634
We don't have to do this.

01:04:59.678 --> 01:05:02.159
We've got nothing to hide, son.
Look around all you want.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.132
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:27.749
We'll start out here
and move around the perimeter.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.200
The tires match.

01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:51.643
Looks like blood.

01:06:03.785 --> 01:06:05.222
Could be the Wheeler girl.

01:06:35.295 --> 01:06:37.994
I think we should go.

01:06:38.037 --> 01:06:39.647
Look what we found
in Nicholas' room.

01:06:39.691 --> 01:06:42.694
What is that? I've never
even seen that before.

01:06:50.354 --> 01:06:51.616
Oh my God.

01:06:51.659 --> 01:06:53.922
Nicholas, what have you done?

01:06:53.966 --> 01:06:56.882
Dad, I don't even
know what that is.

01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:59.058
There's no way that he did this.
Nicholas Ryder...

01:06:59.102 --> 01:07:02.105
you're under arrest for the murders
of Dee James and Morgan Wheeler.

01:07:05.543 --> 01:07:07.371
The last text was
to Ellie Davis.

01:07:07.414 --> 01:07:12.202
What? Dad, tell them I didn't do it.
That isn't mine.

01:07:12.245 --> 01:07:14.334
It will be okay, Nick.
Ellie...

01:07:14.378 --> 01:07:15.988
We'll get this straightened out.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.642
Don't worry.

01:07:21.776 --> 01:07:23.343
Ellie, I...

01:07:51.676 --> 01:07:54.026
At that moment, when
they showed his knife,

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.549
I had this chill.

01:07:55.593 --> 01:07:57.595
It was like after the attack.

01:07:57.638 --> 01:07:59.988
Like I was falling into this
pit, right in their living room.

01:08:01.816 --> 01:08:04.906
Yes, Karen.
All over again.

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:08.258
And I looked at Ellie,
and she was just devastated.

01:08:08.301 --> 01:08:11.087
Now, I'm thinking how lucky she was
that somehow he didn't kill her too.

01:08:13.132 --> 01:08:15.439
Just the other day,
I'm watching them in the yard.

01:08:15.482 --> 01:08:17.962
He's really upset,
and he storms off.

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:19.791
That could have been...

01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:21.270
He could have attacked her.

01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:26.276
He could have done anything.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.908
Hi.

01:08:49.951 --> 01:08:52.737
Ellie, does your mom
know you're here?

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:54.478
Yeah, I wanted to see Nicholas.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.044
You need an adult
if you want to visit him.

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.308
Okay, you're an adult.

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:02.573
I just want to ask him something.
One thing.

01:09:09.274 --> 01:09:11.799
I'm going to stay with you.
No touching, understand?

01:09:11.843 --> 01:09:13.104
Okay.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.889
I don't know how
he's doing today.

01:09:16.761 --> 01:09:18.415
Shit, stay here.

01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:20.156
Nicholas!

01:09:57.889 --> 01:09:58.933
I'll get it.

01:10:03.242 --> 01:10:06.376
Miss Davis?
Yes.

01:10:06.419 --> 01:10:08.029
We've gotten everything
we need off this.

01:10:08.073 --> 01:10:09.944
She can have it back.
Oh, thank you.

01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:13.992
Um, I'm so sorry

01:10:14.035 --> 01:10:15.341
for all you've been through.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:18.301
Is she okay?

01:10:19.606 --> 01:10:21.217
She will be.

01:10:22.566 --> 01:10:23.958
It's just that...

01:10:24.002 --> 01:10:26.613
I don't understand
how Nicholas...

01:10:26.657 --> 01:10:27.832
could do this.

01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:30.878
I mean, are you sure?

01:10:30.922 --> 01:10:33.794
An innocent man doesn't commit
suicide when he's arrested.

01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:37.015
Right.

01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:41.280
This was ugly and hard,

01:10:41.324 --> 01:10:43.630
but it's done now.

01:10:43.674 --> 01:10:46.198
You've both lived through
enough tragedy.

01:10:48.113 --> 01:10:49.245
It ends here.

01:11:35.334 --> 01:11:39.120
Good morning, Ellie.
Hi, Mrs. Taylor.

01:11:39.164 --> 01:11:42.254
All right,
today, we are returning to...

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.038
carbon bonding.

01:11:44.082 --> 01:11:47.651
Can anyone tell me what they
remember from yesterday?

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.133
Hey, Ellie.
You ready?

01:11:52.177 --> 01:11:53.265
We need you.

01:12:26.385 --> 01:12:28.953
I told you, I'm not answering any
questions, so stop calling me, all right?

01:12:28.996 --> 01:12:30.868
It's Ellie.

01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:32.130
Ellie?

01:12:33.566 --> 01:12:34.915
You all right?

01:12:34.959 --> 01:12:36.743
I hope it's okay
that I'm calling.

01:12:39.877 --> 01:12:41.966
It's fine.

01:12:42.009 --> 01:12:43.271
You okay?

01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:48.015
I'm so sorry
about what's happened.

01:12:48.059 --> 01:12:49.626
But I don't know,
something just feels...

01:12:50.888 --> 01:12:51.889
strange.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.414
Wrong.

01:12:55.458 --> 01:12:58.461
I know. I don't know why
he did the things that he did.

01:12:58.504 --> 01:13:01.028
No, I mean that
the Nicholas that I know...

01:13:01.072 --> 01:13:02.378
knew...

01:13:04.205 --> 01:13:06.251
he could never have done this.

01:13:06.294 --> 01:13:07.513
Any of it.

01:13:07.557 --> 01:13:09.341
But...

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.082
he must have, right?

01:13:13.476 --> 01:13:14.477
Yeah.

01:13:17.784 --> 01:13:19.482
I remember on that last day...

01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:22.441
he was going
to tell me something.

01:13:24.095 --> 01:13:26.793
Did he... say anything to you?

01:13:28.795 --> 01:13:30.536
No.

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:31.755
Not a word.

01:13:37.978 --> 01:13:40.372
I gotta go, Ellie.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:42.418
Okay, but if you ever need someone to...

01:14:47.874 --> 01:14:49.180
Where's your phone, Dee?

01:15:11.898 --> 01:15:13.117
Ellie.

01:15:14.379 --> 01:15:15.336
Hi.

01:15:17.121 --> 01:15:18.165
Come in.

01:15:36.836 --> 01:15:38.534
And you are...

01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:52.765
Chief Patterson?

01:15:54.114 --> 01:15:56.073
How did you know
I'd be arriving?

01:15:56.116 --> 01:15:58.292
Intuition.

01:15:58.336 --> 01:16:02.209
Marjorie Fuller?
Yes, I've been traveling with my husband.

01:16:02.253 --> 01:16:05.561
I just found a whole bunch of
messages on my home voice mail from,

01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:06.605
well, I guess from you.

01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:08.520
Yes, we called.

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:10.478
San Vicente Police checking up
on the bunkhouse ownership.

01:16:12.002 --> 01:16:14.221
Is this about Nicky?
Did you know Nicholas?

01:16:15.483 --> 01:16:17.616
He's my nephew.
Oh.

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.400
I'm Don Jackson's sister.

01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:21.228
Don Jackson, not Don Ryder?

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.492
That's one of his made-up names.

01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:28.235
I...

01:16:28.279 --> 01:16:29.454
just wanted you to have this.

01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:32.805
Oh, this is beautiful.

01:16:36.896 --> 01:16:38.768
I'm just so sorry
for everything that...

01:16:40.465 --> 01:16:41.771
what he put you through.

01:16:42.946 --> 01:16:44.077
Both of us.

01:16:49.561 --> 01:16:52.259
We had to keep moving because
he kept getting into trouble.

01:16:55.349 --> 01:16:56.699
But I never thought anything...

01:16:57.874 --> 01:16:59.484
anything like this.

01:17:04.489 --> 01:17:06.317
You just rode your bike
over here, didn't you?

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:09.059
Yeah.

01:17:11.148 --> 01:17:12.628
I always thought
that was so sweet.

01:17:14.368 --> 01:17:16.370
You riding your bike.

01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:22.376
You know what I need?

01:17:24.509 --> 01:17:25.510
What?

01:17:27.338 --> 01:17:28.513
A hug.

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:32.517
Come on, please.

01:17:44.007 --> 01:17:45.225
I've got something for you.

01:17:46.836 --> 01:17:48.098
Stay right here.

01:17:51.884 --> 01:17:53.930
When Don and I were kids,
our dad, he...

01:17:55.453 --> 01:17:57.542
he was arrested...

01:17:57.585 --> 01:17:58.804
for assaulting these girls.

01:18:00.545 --> 01:18:01.720
He hurt them pretty badly...

01:18:03.374 --> 01:18:04.984
and he got locked up for it.

01:18:07.117 --> 01:18:09.859
Don blamed the girls.

01:18:12.209 --> 01:18:14.472
He was sure they were lying.

01:18:14.515 --> 01:18:15.952
And he never got over it.

01:18:17.518 --> 01:18:18.737
No.

01:18:25.788 --> 01:18:27.920
Jane?
Is everything okay?

01:18:27.964 --> 01:18:29.792
Are you with Ellie?
No.

01:18:29.835 --> 01:18:31.924
She's at Don's. She was
feeling sorry for him.

01:18:31.968 --> 01:18:33.099
Why?

01:18:33.143 --> 01:18:34.622
Don is the killer, not Nicholas.

01:18:34.666 --> 01:18:36.581
Oh my God.

01:18:36.624 --> 01:18:38.322
If you're home, stay there.

01:18:38.365 --> 01:18:39.715
Oh my God!

01:19:19.972 --> 01:19:22.105
You know, I feel like

01:19:22.148 --> 01:19:25.282
you brought me here
to your town.

01:19:25.325 --> 01:19:26.805
You, and your sister,

01:19:26.849 --> 01:19:28.198
and your friends.

01:19:30.591 --> 01:19:32.158
You framed your own son.

01:19:33.464 --> 01:19:34.944
That was your fault.

01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:37.120
Nicholas was never
supposed to know.

01:19:37.163 --> 01:19:38.686
You just couldn't let it go.

01:19:40.253 --> 01:19:43.604
Girls like you walk around
like you're royalty.

01:19:43.648 --> 01:19:45.563
You have no idea how much
everybody hates you.

01:19:45.606 --> 01:19:46.912
You sick asshole.

01:19:46.956 --> 01:19:48.435
You killed people I loved.

01:19:48.479 --> 01:19:50.698
Yeah.

01:19:50.742 --> 01:19:52.352
Do you recognize this?

01:20:57.243 --> 01:20:58.505
You stupid bitch!

01:21:10.169 --> 01:21:11.301
Ellie?

01:21:41.157 --> 01:21:42.636
