00:01.609 --> 00:03.414
Those monsters are on the loose,
we need to smoke them out.

00:03.974 --> 00:05.008
We'll start with the Hilltop.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.641
Previously on
"The Walking Dead"...

00:07.917 --> 00:10.675
Open up, ain't nobody leavin'
until they look around.

00:10.951 --> 00:13.813
You are gonna get me
my cash.

00:14.055 --> 00:18.227
They wanted us to stay quiet but
there are good people here.

00:18.503 --> 00:19.813
They need to know the truth.

00:20.089 --> 00:21.882
You want me to look
for secret files?

00:22.158 --> 00:24.468
Yes, and steal them.
This involves the Miltons?

00:24.744 --> 00:26.572
The young psychopath,
at least.

00:26.848 --> 00:30.227
My name is Lance Hornsby and I'm
here to offer you a job.

02:05.882 --> 02:07.434
I'm not a baby anymore, Mom.

02:07.434 --> 02:08.779
Right. I forgot.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.951
I don't wanna go.

02:14.951 --> 02:18.606
It's only temporary.
Okay?

02:18.606 --> 02:21.606
I promise.

02:21.606 --> 02:23.779
I wanna help.
I know you do, Hershel,

02:23.779 --> 02:25.434
but not this time, okay?

02:28.537 --> 02:29.675
How far
do you think?

02:29.675 --> 02:31.813
12 miles south,
give or take.

02:31.813 --> 02:33.882
Should get there before dark
if we move fast.

02:35.986 --> 02:38.606
Then we'll be back
before you know it.

02:38.606 --> 02:40.331
Okay?

02:52.641 --> 02:54.262
I got you.

03:12.331 --> 03:14.400
Call it.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.744
Tails, I guess.

03:17.813 --> 03:19.675
Over there, please.

03:22.537 --> 03:24.365
Gonna give us
the assignment, sir?

03:27.262 --> 03:28.606
You'll know soon enough.

03:37.710 --> 03:40.227
Morning.
Oh, my God.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.227
I thought
you were still asleep.

03:43.227 --> 03:45.744
Well, I was --
soundly so.

03:47.917 --> 03:50.779
I thought we had a lovely night,
didn't we?

03:50.779 --> 03:52.296
Yeah, we did.

03:52.296 --> 03:54.124
What are you reading?

03:54.124 --> 03:55.606
Um, just...

03:55.606 --> 03:57.641
stuff on physics.

03:57.641 --> 03:59.917
"An object in motion" --
you know.

03:59.917 --> 04:01.296
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

04:01.296 --> 04:03.020
Well...

04:07.055 --> 04:08.882
Just so you know...

04:10.227 --> 04:12.400
you are the most remarkable
human I have ever met

04:12.400 --> 04:14.779
in my heretofore
uneventful life.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.089
Okay, let's not get carried away here.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.124
You're beautiful
in every way.

04:20.848 --> 04:22.779
Thank you.

04:31.296 --> 04:32.882
I have to
get ready for work.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.882
If you're having hesitation
about what

04:40.882 --> 04:42.779
I've asked you to do...

04:45.124 --> 04:46.503
No.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.262
I said I'll do it.

04:48.262 --> 04:49.986
I just, um...

04:52.400 --> 04:53.641
Hey.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.296
You can tell me.

04:58.675 --> 05:02.296
I just can't stop thinking about
what happens after we do this.

05:02.296 --> 05:05.848
This place pushes on people
to keep things the same.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.779
I just worry they'll keep
pushing till we all break.

05:26.710 --> 05:27.744
Clear.

05:33.986 --> 05:35.296
This room is clear!

05:36.434 --> 05:37.779
They're not splitting up.

05:37.779 --> 05:40.089
-Clear!
-Yeah, they will.

05:40.089 --> 05:42.365
This might be our best shot.
No, it's too risky.

05:42.365 --> 05:44.434
We need to just get through this
and get back home.

05:44.434 --> 05:46.296
There is no "getting
through this," all right?

05:46.296 --> 05:48.434
We are in the shit till we find
a way to fight our way out.

05:48.434 --> 05:51.710
Look, we keep heading north,
away from our group.

05:51.710 --> 05:53.779
We find our moment, we take it.

05:53.779 --> 05:55.882
Hey, what's with the chit-chat?

05:55.882 --> 05:57.296
Man, we need a break.

05:57.296 --> 05:58.951
Been doing this
for a while now.

05:58.951 --> 06:01.020
And we'llkeep
doing this for a while,

06:01.020 --> 06:04.020
if that's what it takes.

06:04.020 --> 06:05.744
Hey, you check
Charleston yet?

06:05.744 --> 06:07.917
Why?
What's in Charleston?

06:07.917 --> 06:09.779
There's a rumor up
on the rooftops

06:09.779 --> 06:11.813
they trade
for weapons and stuff.

06:11.813 --> 06:14.296
Might be something, might not.

06:14.296 --> 06:16.848
Move!

06:45.262 --> 06:46.917
Romano, what's your 20?

06:54.400 --> 06:58.227
13 miles past the last outpost.

06:58.227 --> 07:01.606
Second location is cleared,
one more to go.

07:01.606 --> 07:02.848
Copy that.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.331
Let's move.

07:11.606 --> 07:13.882
Hornsby's checking in on us.

07:13.882 --> 07:16.262
We need to watch our backs.

07:16.262 --> 07:17.744
Yeah.

07:34.055 --> 07:36.917
Sounds like it's getting closer.

07:36.917 --> 07:38.710
Because it is.

07:44.537 --> 07:46.227
Mom?

07:47.675 --> 07:48.779
I'm okay.

07:48.779 --> 07:50.468
No, you're not.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.951
Hershel...

07:56.813 --> 07:58.882
Everything I've done...

08:00.572 --> 08:03.400
And everything I still do...

08:03.400 --> 08:05.537
is so that
we have choices.

08:05.537 --> 08:08.986
The place that we're going
right now, you may not like it.

08:08.986 --> 08:11.262
But I promise you,

08:11.262 --> 08:13.813
it is the right choice.

08:13.813 --> 08:15.503
For now.

08:31.813 --> 08:34.433
Oh, you made it!
This way.

08:41.917 --> 08:43.744
Exciting.

08:43.744 --> 08:45.468
Don't you think?

08:52.468 --> 08:54.400
Things are coming together.

08:58.262 --> 09:00.193
You get the scalp of the woman
who killed your family,

09:00.193 --> 09:02.710
and I finally get to do
my job without interference.

09:04.779 --> 09:07.158
Everybody wins.

09:07.158 --> 09:08.779
Well...

09:08.779 --> 09:10.089
not everybody.

09:26.744 --> 09:28.020
I'll need to see.

09:33.606 --> 09:36.020
When she's dead.

09:36.020 --> 09:38.813
I'll need to see her
when she's dead.

09:38.813 --> 09:40.089
You will.

09:40.089 --> 09:41.779
Come on.

10:13.089 --> 10:15.572
Okay, this thing is stuck.

10:31.917 --> 10:33.606
Maggie.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.951
Hey, kid.

10:38.951 --> 10:41.572
And you're sure this guy
Hornsby and his men are coming?

10:41.572 --> 10:44.193
Yes, Elijah spotted a few of
them 5 miles

10:44.193 --> 10:46.296
outside our walls last night.

10:48.503 --> 10:49.641
Thoughts?

10:51.710 --> 10:53.434
You helped us,

10:53.434 --> 10:56.641
and I am grateful.

10:56.641 --> 11:00.055
And I got no problem
watching the kid at all.

11:00.055 --> 11:04.193
But, Annie, my wife,
is pregnant,

11:04.193 --> 11:07.365
so there is no way
I'm gonna sit in some

11:07.365 --> 11:10.986
Whisperer worm hole
while you're out --

11:10.986 --> 11:13.296
I don't know --
saving some shithole of a home

11:13.296 --> 11:14.813
that's not worth saving.

11:14.813 --> 11:16.158
Negan, don't.

11:16.158 --> 11:20.020
Actually, he's right.

11:20.020 --> 11:23.296
Maybe Hilltop
isn't worth saving.

11:23.296 --> 11:25.572
Those people are.

11:25.572 --> 11:28.882
This fight that I'm in,
that I started,

11:28.882 --> 11:30.779
with Hornsby --

11:30.779 --> 11:33.503
it's not gonna end
until I end it.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.986
And I got no doubt  you will.

11:37.020 --> 11:39.779
But I also got no doubt that you are firmly

11:39.779 --> 11:43.331
in the crosshairs
of this Lance asshole, so...

11:47.020 --> 11:48.296
So I'm coming with you.

11:48.296 --> 11:50.882
No.
I'll finish it.

11:50.882 --> 11:53.572
Maggie, we can help fight --
No, please.

11:53.572 --> 11:55.848
I need you to stay here --
with Hershel,

11:55.848 --> 11:58.055
with those others.

11:58.055 --> 12:01.434
Keep them away from Hilltop
and safe until this is over.

12:02.227 --> 12:04.331
He doesn't exactly trust me,  you know?

12:06.813 --> 12:08.503
But I'm starting to.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.779
You saved him...

12:14.779 --> 12:16.434
at Riverbend.

12:18.951 --> 12:22.503
Whatever else happens,

12:22.503 --> 12:26.089
and whatever else has happened,

12:26.089 --> 12:27.710
I will never forget that.

12:30.537 --> 12:32.331
Wow.

12:32.331 --> 12:35.227
You have big balls,
Maggie Rhee.

12:38.055 --> 12:40.158
I got you.

12:40.158 --> 12:41.606
And I got your boy.

12:47.606 --> 12:48.779
Annie...

12:48.779 --> 12:51.537
He'll be waiting for you
when this is done.

12:51.537 --> 12:53.331
I promise you that.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.124
Thank you.

13:01.710 --> 13:03.641
Oh, shit.

13:03.641 --> 13:06.296
If that ain't a sign
from the Man Upstairs.

13:28.262 --> 13:31.020
You at the second location?

13:31.020 --> 13:33.365
Clearing that now.

13:33.365 --> 13:35.331
Finish.

13:35.331 --> 13:38.227
Then head back.

13:38.227 --> 13:40.055
Copy that, sir.
We'll head back.

13:46.020 --> 13:49.158
One last sweep, then home.

13:49.158 --> 13:51.710
All right, great.

13:51.710 --> 13:53.262
I'll lead.

15:01.986 --> 15:04.331
Cover left, cover left!

15:05.813 --> 15:07.710
Aah!

15:15.296 --> 15:17.020
Keep 'em surrounded!

15:26.400 --> 15:27.882
Flanking left!
Cover me!

15:54.848 --> 15:56.917
Moving up!
Cover me, cover me!

16:05.606 --> 16:07.400
Watch that left!
Watch that left!

17:06.606 --> 17:08.951
Where's Hornsby?

17:08.951 --> 17:10.675
Screw you.

17:23.606 --> 17:25.124
It's your choice.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.331
Maybe...

17:37.331 --> 17:39.503
Maybe 10 miles out.

17:39.503 --> 17:42.710
He said he wanted...

17:42.710 --> 17:44.503
Said he wanted
to clear the field.

17:48.710 --> 17:50.365
"Clear the field"?

17:50.365 --> 17:52.158
Leave only allies behind.

17:54.296 --> 17:56.193
Maggie.

17:56.193 --> 17:57.641
Romano, you there?

18:02.572 --> 18:04.262
He ain't here anymore.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.158
Move!
Now!

18:23.951 --> 18:25.882
And when this world fell,

18:25.882 --> 18:27.710
we gathered up
the scattered pieces,

18:27.710 --> 18:30.020
and we put them
back together again.

18:30.020 --> 18:34.503
It wasn't easy,
and we faltered at times.

18:34.503 --> 18:36.020
But we found a reason to live

18:36.020 --> 18:40.193
when everything
outside these walls...

18:40.193 --> 18:41.882
was dead.

18:45.365 --> 18:47.124
Max?

18:51.331 --> 18:53.020
You okay?

18:53.020 --> 18:54.365
You seem...

18:54.365 --> 18:56.779
far away.

18:56.779 --> 18:59.296
No, I'm good.

18:59.296 --> 19:01.124
I'm right here.

19:01.124 --> 19:04.400
Max, if you're having
a bad day, you can tell me.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.503
I do get it, you know?

19:06.503 --> 19:09.089
Always having to be "strong,"
never show any emotion.

19:09.089 --> 19:10.951
But if we can't show that
to each other,

19:10.951 --> 19:12.641
who can we show it to?

19:12.641 --> 19:14.055
I appreciate it, Pamela.

19:14.055 --> 19:16.365
You know I do.
But...

19:16.365 --> 19:18.089
I am really okay.

19:26.537 --> 19:29.468
Oh, before I forget.

19:29.468 --> 19:32.951
Accounting sent over
the Founders' Day budget.

19:32.951 --> 19:35.813
There's a $50,000 surplus.

19:35.813 --> 19:37.365
Well, that's great.

19:37.365 --> 19:42.089
I was gonna suggest something,
if you're open to it?

19:42.089 --> 19:44.917
How about starting
a scholarship fund

19:44.917 --> 19:47.124
for our less-fortunate
families?

19:47.124 --> 19:50.813
I've put together a proposal,
and we could...

19:50.813 --> 19:52.262
Is that...
okay?

19:52.262 --> 19:54.779
Of course! I love your
out-of-the-box thinking.

19:54.779 --> 19:58.675
But any extra funds go
right back into the event.

19:58.675 --> 20:01.986
It's our biggest day
of the year.

20:01.986 --> 20:03.537
Sure.

20:03.537 --> 20:05.848
I understand.

20:05.848 --> 20:07.227
You really should
get going.

20:07.227 --> 20:10.296
You've got that
5:00 dinner.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.675
Yes, thank you.

20:14.882 --> 20:17.193
I don't know what I'd do
without you, Max.

20:21.227 --> 20:23.331
You're leaving soon,
too, right?

20:25.331 --> 20:26.813
Right behind you.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.744
Hey.

21:38.503 --> 21:40.606
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

21:40.606 --> 21:41.986
No, Sebastian, hi.

21:41.986 --> 21:43.468
Uh, no, you didn't.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.917
Is there something
that I can help you --

21:44.917 --> 21:47.468
Yes, uh, is -- is...

21:47.468 --> 21:49.193
Uh, is my mom pissed at me?

21:49.193 --> 21:52.158
You know, 'cause I keep asking
for her, and -- and...

21:52.158 --> 21:53.710
nothing, so...
It's just been

21:53.710 --> 21:54.986
a hectic
afternoon, so --

21:54.986 --> 21:56.331
I gotta talk to her,
so could you just --

21:56.331 --> 21:58.882
If you could get her
for me, Max...

21:58.882 --> 22:00.296
She's actually at
a work dinner,

22:00.296 --> 22:02.400
but I can get word
to her for you.

22:03.917 --> 22:05.917
"Get word to her"?

22:07.055 --> 22:09.227
Yeah, yeah, why --

22:09.227 --> 22:12.986
Why don't you go "get word"
to her for me.

22:12.986 --> 22:14.744
Her only child.

22:16.020 --> 22:19.055
That is such bullshit.

22:19.055 --> 22:21.020
I'm really sorry,
Sebastian,

22:21.020 --> 22:22.503
but I was actually
on my way out, so...

22:22.503 --> 22:24.468
Oh, you never stop!

22:25.951 --> 22:28.227
But, working, working, hey.

22:28.227 --> 22:30.158
You just...
Oh, God,

22:30.158 --> 22:31.813
I mean, you even
take it home with you?

22:31.813 --> 22:33.262
Oh, no, that's --
I -- I got it.

22:33.262 --> 22:34.986
It's okay.
That's fine.

22:37.468 --> 22:42.262
Always clumsy after one too many
afternoon coffees, you know?

22:50.813 --> 22:54.710
Yeah, it's, uh...

22:54.710 --> 22:56.296
poor man's drug.

22:57.813 --> 22:59.468
Caffeine.

24:14.089 --> 24:16.089
No sign of Hornsby.

24:16.089 --> 24:18.503
Asshole always has
somebody else do his dirty work.

24:18.503 --> 24:20.641
See if we can recover
any of their weapons.

24:20.641 --> 24:22.296
Follow their trail back
to their camp,

24:22.296 --> 24:24.400
and then we end this.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.813
On it.

24:25.813 --> 24:26.917
You ready, bud?

24:26.917 --> 24:28.503
As ever.

24:28.503 --> 24:30.675
Let's do it.

24:32.641 --> 24:36.400
Marco!

24:36.400 --> 24:37.503
Get down!

24:46.089 --> 24:47.744
No.
Marco!

24:49.468 --> 24:51.020
Go, go.

26:02.158 --> 26:04.641
How many?

26:04.641 --> 26:06.365
Three.

26:09.882 --> 26:11.537
Leah, your 20?

26:14.434 --> 26:16.675
Leah, what the hell was that?!

26:16.675 --> 26:18.296
I drew 'em out.

26:18.296 --> 26:20.089
I'm doin' this my way.

26:20.089 --> 26:21.813
Your way got my men killed!

26:21.813 --> 26:23.744
Collateral damage.

26:30.434 --> 26:33.227
I've got others fanned
over a 20-mile perimeter.

26:33.227 --> 26:35.089
We'll find them.

26:35.089 --> 26:36.744
You goddamned better.

26:47.813 --> 26:50.055
His troopers are here.

26:50.055 --> 26:51.917
He's gotta be close.

26:51.917 --> 26:53.848
Yeah.

26:53.848 --> 26:55.537
We got walkers, too.

27:05.710 --> 27:08.813
He set traps for them.

27:08.813 --> 27:10.503
These aren't for them.

27:40.020 --> 27:42.813
What is it?

27:42.813 --> 27:44.020
Leah.

27:48.020 --> 27:50.779
I think we should split up,
cover more ground.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.537
You sure it was her?

28:16.537 --> 28:17.779
Yes.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.158
Go, please.

28:19.158 --> 28:20.468
I'll lead
Leah and the others away.

28:20.468 --> 28:21.710
I am not gonna leave you.

28:21.710 --> 28:24.227
I will not risk losing you two.

28:24.227 --> 28:26.158
We can handle ourselves,
Maggie, okay?

28:26.158 --> 28:28.606
We'll draw them away, too,
and then, when everyone's safe,

28:28.606 --> 28:30.296
we'll just go meet up
with the others.

28:32.331 --> 28:34.089
I'll find you.
Go.

29:12.641 --> 29:15.296
Tyler Davis is on this list.

29:16.710 --> 29:18.744
And the woman Rosita tried
to help out

29:18.744 --> 29:22.468
during the heist
is on here, too.

29:22.468 --> 29:25.503
I counted 200 more.

29:25.503 --> 29:27.537
What about these numbers?

29:27.537 --> 29:29.365
They look like...
codes?

29:29.365 --> 29:30.882
Maybe coordinates?

29:30.882 --> 29:33.882
So you think this is about
where they're hiding people.

29:35.193 --> 29:37.158
Why don't we write about that?

29:37.158 --> 29:40.434
No, not yet.

29:40.434 --> 29:43.572
I need proof.

29:43.572 --> 29:47.606
Something this big,
this explosive?

29:47.606 --> 29:49.951
We -- We need a key
to crack the code.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.503
U-Until we have that,

29:53.503 --> 29:56.537
I'll write about
Sebastian's heist...

29:57.572 --> 29:59.365
and hang it around
Pamela's neck.

29:59.365 --> 30:03.744
I mean, when everyone finds out
that she's not on their side,

30:03.744 --> 30:06.331
they're gonna question
everything about this place.

30:06.331 --> 30:08.848
Hence
the aforementioned uprising.

30:10.882 --> 30:13.193
No, hey, hey, hey!
It's -- It's okay.

30:13.193 --> 30:16.537
I thought we could use help,
so I told him to come.

30:19.055 --> 30:21.089
Sorry I'm late.

30:21.089 --> 30:23.193
Trying to round up
a few more for the cause.

30:23.193 --> 30:24.641
-Geez.
-I told him

30:24.641 --> 30:27.986
we'd needed more people
to get the article out.

30:27.986 --> 30:31.951
And I got a whole network, ready
and willing to ride at dawn.

30:36.917 --> 30:38.400
We're doing this?

30:49.331 --> 30:50.951
Let's ride.

33:45.158 --> 33:48.537
I have waited for
this moment for a long time.

33:54.331 --> 33:56.089
I know what you want.

33:59.710 --> 34:02.227
I wanted it myself
for a long time.

34:04.331 --> 34:06.882
You can't kill me.
That would be too easy.

34:08.536 --> 34:11.193
If that was what you wanted,
you would've done it already.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.951
You want me to suffer.

34:22.641 --> 34:25.467
Feel everything that you felt.

34:25.467 --> 34:27.123
All the pain.

34:30.848 --> 34:32.158
'Cause somewhere inside you,

34:32.158 --> 34:34.089
you think that'll take
away your pain.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.089
It won't.

34:44.262 --> 34:46.710
You're wrong.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.606
It's not just you.

34:51.675 --> 34:54.193
By the time I'm done...

34:55.813 --> 34:58.606
Everyone you love will be dead.

35:24.951 --> 35:27.744
Then I guess
that makes us even.

35:27.744 --> 35:29.675
I took your family,

35:29.675 --> 35:31.262
you take mine.

35:37.089 --> 35:38.882
Nature has a way of
taking care of these things.

35:38.882 --> 35:40.675
It's not nature.

35:40.675 --> 35:43.468
Or fate.

35:43.468 --> 35:44.744
It's us.

35:46.779 --> 35:50.710
I killed your people
because it was what I wanted.

35:51.641 --> 35:53.744
If this is what you want,
Leah...

35:58.296 --> 35:59.779
Go ahead.

36:01.744 --> 36:05.158
You want it, so do it.

36:05.158 --> 36:06.641
Go on.

36:09.572 --> 36:10.641
Hyah!

37:35.710 --> 37:37.606
They're in there!

37:47.365 --> 37:48.572
Sir, are you okay?

37:48.572 --> 37:49.986
Let it go!
On the other side!

37:49.986 --> 37:51.262
Who's my backup here?

37:51.262 --> 37:52.744
Hold your fire!

38:19.089 --> 38:21.124
Now we take it all.

41:21.951 --> 41:23.572
Oh, shit.

41:24.020 --> 41:26.468
If that ain't a sign
from the Man Upstairs.

41:26.917 --> 41:30.089
The locusts, in some ways
it's an atmospheric element.

41:30.365 --> 41:31.951
It's just part of, like,

41:32.227 --> 41:35.468
the sense of the world itself
is hostile.

41:35.951 --> 41:38.882
I think for our heroes,
this overwhelming sound

41:39.158 --> 41:41.468
is part of, like,
what makes things complicated,

41:41.917 --> 41:44.986
because it makes it harder to
hear Leah coming, for example.

41:45.262 --> 41:47.503
But, on the other hand,
they're looking at it

41:47.986 --> 41:50.331
as kind of like
this unsettling thing,

41:50.606 --> 41:52.331
which is this a problem
for them

41:52.606 --> 41:54.468
in terms of, like, being,
like, a harbinger

41:54.572 --> 41:57.055
of more problems to come.

41:57.331 --> 41:59.468
Seems like
it's getting closer.

41:59.572 --> 42:01.158
Because it is.

42:01.434 --> 42:03.227
There's just a lot
running through their heads

42:03.468 --> 42:08.331
as they're seeing, like, nature
just act up and be their enemy.

42:14.227 --> 42:15.193
Maggie.

42:15.468 --> 42:17.193
I think, like,
a lot of things

42:17.468 --> 42:19.193
started to shift
in that relationship,

42:19.468 --> 42:20.710
'cause there's a couple
of things

42:20.986 --> 42:22.434
that I think are really key.

42:22.537 --> 42:23.710
Go.

42:24.951 --> 42:28.158
Negan put the call out to help   to Maggie.

42:28.434 --> 42:30.296
So, when they were in a jam,

42:30.572 --> 42:32.262
that's the person
that he sent a letter to,

42:32.537 --> 42:35.951
and he sent that rider
to Hilltop to call for help.

42:36.227 --> 42:38.055
And the thing is, Maggie came.

42:38.331 --> 42:39.710
And I think for Maggie's side,

42:40.158 --> 42:44.158
she saw that Negan vowed to make
sure that Hershel stayed okay,

42:44.434 --> 42:47.124
and that was the end result.

42:47.400 --> 42:50.365
He doesn't exactly trust me,
you know?

42:51.710 --> 42:53.193
But I'm starting to.

42:53.503 --> 42:56.124
She has not forgiven him,

42:56.400 --> 42:59.124
and I don't think she's ever
going to forget.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.641
But there is something different
about the idea

43:02.089 --> 43:05.606
of saying, like, "But I can
trust you as an ally."

43:05.710 --> 43:07.779
I got you.

43:08.055 --> 43:09.606
And I got your boy.

43:10.055 --> 43:12.503
She knows she has to trust
somebody with Hershel

43:12.779 --> 43:16.572
because something is coming that
she's going to have to face.

43:16.641 --> 43:18.020
I'll finish it.

43:18.296 --> 43:20.296
Maggie, we can help fight --
No, please.

43:20.572 --> 43:22.675
I need you to stay here --
with Hershel,

43:22.744 --> 43:24.262
with those others.

43:24.537 --> 43:26.813
Maggie also trusts Annie.

43:27.296 --> 43:30.158
I think she gets the vibe
that Annie is a good person.

43:30.434 --> 43:33.158
I think she thinks that Annie
grounds Negan

43:33.434 --> 43:35.262
in some kind of way
that's interesting.

43:35.537 --> 43:37.434
Like, she's, like,
reading all those dynamics.

43:37.710 --> 43:40.572
She's feeling like the person
that he wound up with

43:41.020 --> 43:44.262
is somebody that is as good
a person as, like, any of us.

43:44.537 --> 43:46.055
And I think she's right.

43:47.124 --> 43:48.951
I don't want to go.

43:49.227 --> 43:52.055
It's only temporary,
okay?

43:52.331 --> 43:53.606
I promise.

43:54.089 --> 43:57.572
She's really realizing,
like, maybe she's holding

43:58.055 --> 44:00.468
onto something
that's the wrong version

44:00.744 --> 44:02.055
of what she wants to hold onto.

44:02.331 --> 44:05.882
And I think what she wants
to hold onto

44:06.158 --> 44:07.331
is a sense of community,

44:07.606 --> 44:09.986
the memory of the people
that she lost.

44:10.262 --> 44:12.572
You know, Glenn is buried
at the Hilltop.

44:12.848 --> 44:16.744
But does the Barrington house
itself matter?

44:17.193 --> 44:19.744
And I think, like, that's
something that she's kind of

44:19.848 --> 44:21.710
taking from the conversation.

44:21.813 --> 44:22.951
She's come to the conclusion

44:23.227 --> 44:24.537
that people
are the most important,

44:24.813 --> 44:27.020
but that does mean that we have
to make a stand here.

44:34.503 --> 44:35.641
Follow their trail back
to their camp,

44:35.710 --> 44:37.400
and then we end this.

44:37.641 --> 44:39.744
She really is
like a good war leader,

44:39.813 --> 44:41.503
and she's a good strategist.

44:41.744 --> 44:44.400
I think the thing that she did
not see coming was Leah.

44:46.641 --> 44:48.055
That is a fight of pure hatred.

44:48.331 --> 44:51.193
They cannot stand each other.

44:51.468 --> 44:55.055
When you get caught
in a cycle of violence,

44:55.331 --> 44:58.400
and, like, revenge,
where is the end point

44:58.675 --> 45:00.572
when it's one retaliation
after another,

45:00.848 --> 45:03.158
because Maggie feels like Leah
was the aggressor.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.675
"Her and her people
came and killed my people."

45:05.158 --> 45:07.537
And Leah feels like,
"But we made a deal with you

45:07.779 --> 45:10.055
in good faith, and then you shot
my people in the back,

45:10.331 --> 45:11.813
and you tried to kill me."

45:12.296 --> 45:15.951
I have waited for
this moment for a long time.

45:16.227 --> 45:17.572
I know what you want.

45:17.848 --> 45:20.917
I wanted it myself
for a long time.

45:21.193 --> 45:22.503
They cannot see eye-to-eye

45:22.779 --> 45:24.641
because they're both people
who are leaders

45:24.917 --> 45:28.227
that feel like the other person
was responsible for the murder

45:28.503 --> 45:29.744
of everybody that they loved.

45:29.848 --> 45:31.606
Yah!

45:33.606 --> 45:36.434
For Leah, she also wants to see
Maggie suffer the way she did.

45:36.710 --> 45:40.020
And so, in some ways,
that might have been her mistake

45:40.503 --> 45:44.468
as a villain, rather than just
taking a shot when she could.

45:47.606 --> 45:49.365
For Daryl,
Maggie's like his sister,

45:49.641 --> 45:52.365
and Daryl always feels
like he owes a debt to Maggie.

45:52.641 --> 45:54.675
So, there's not even, like,
a moment of like,

45:54.779 --> 45:55.951
"What do I choose?"

45:56.227 --> 45:57.296
There's nothing to choose.

45:57.572 --> 45:59.020
The only choice he could make
is Maggie.

46:01.193 --> 46:02.537
Sir, are you okay?

46:02.813 --> 46:05.468
For Hornsby, this is a
no-good, very bad, horrible day.

46:05.744 --> 46:07.675
Part of what's still driving
Hornsby

46:07.951 --> 46:10.537
is he doesn't want this
to get back to Pamela.

46:10.813 --> 46:14.227
And the bigger
this mess becomes,

46:14.503 --> 46:15.813
the harder it's gonna be
to cover it up.

46:16.296 --> 46:19.124
Now it's just become, like,
"I need to wipe out the threat."

46:19.400 --> 46:20.606
Everybody who is out here,

46:20.848 --> 46:22.055
like, they've got a target
on their back now.

46:27.434 --> 46:29.572
Call it.

46:29.675 --> 46:30.779
Tails, I guess.

46:32.262 --> 46:34.882
We've been talking a lot
about luck

46:34.986 --> 46:36.331
in this block of episodes.

46:36.606 --> 46:37.641
We want to believe

46:37.917 --> 46:40.331
that everything
is within our control.

46:40.606 --> 46:42.400
But is it truly all
within our control?

46:42.675 --> 46:44.262
I think that's something
that all of our characters

46:44.537 --> 46:46.917
in varying ways
are grappling with.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.331
And we've got a lot
of characters in this episode

46:49.606 --> 46:50.744
that are feeling like,

46:51.227 --> 46:54.296
"I want to, like, snatch fate
into my hands

46:54.572 --> 46:55.675
so that it's not just
a flip of the coin."

46:55.951 --> 46:57.813
It's not just what somebody
tells you

46:57.882 --> 46:59.468
is gonna happen to you.

46:59.744 --> 47:01.848
I think that's really, like,
where a lot of our characters

47:02.296 --> 47:05.434
are feeling at sea when they
reach this block of episodes,

47:05.710 --> 47:08.262
and that's gonna, like, inform
where they want to, like,

47:08.537 --> 47:10.193
continue going as we get
into the final block

47:10.468 --> 47:11.641
of the series.
