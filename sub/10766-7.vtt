WEBVTT

00:05.551 --> 00:06.575
What's up, Prince?

00:06.652 --> 00:09.177
Me and Carlton just checking out
these college brochures.

00:09.254 --> 00:11.245
I've already set my sights on Princeton.

00:11.323 --> 00:12.551
It has a balanced curriculum...

00:12.624 --> 00:15.559
with the largest repository
of classical literature.

00:15.627 --> 00:18.687
Y eah, well,
I got my sights set on this school...

00:18.764 --> 00:22.564
with the largest repository of girls
with the big old butts. Oh, yeah!

00:25.003 --> 00:27.995
Which reminds me,
I brought your CD player back.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.615 --> 00:40.949
See, Jazz,
now this is not my CD player, see...

00:41.019 --> 00:43.749
'cause my CD player
has the wires on the inside.

00:44.723 --> 00:47.624
I'm sorry, man.
How can I make it up to you?

00:48.160 --> 00:50.253
Jazz, how about paying for it?

00:50.329 --> 00:52.820
Why would I want to buy
a broken CD player?

02:02.067 --> 02:03.193
- Hey, Aunt Viv.
- Hi, guys.

02:03.268 --> 02:05.361
- Hey, Judge.
- Now, Will, please.

02:05.437 --> 02:07.200
I haven't even announced that I'm running.

02:07.272 --> 02:09.365
I don't think you'd have to announce it,
Mr. Banks.

02:09.441 --> 02:11.534
If you ran, we'd hear you coming.

02:20.552 --> 02:23.282
I'm running for Superior Court Judge.

02:23.355 --> 02:25.118
He still could use the exercise.

02:25.190 --> 02:27.124
Will, Carlton...

02:27.592 --> 02:31.585
I want you guys to be on your best
behavior tomorrow and look presentable.

02:31.663 --> 02:34.530
It's navy-blue jacket,
gray slacks, power tie.

02:34.599 --> 02:38.000
Whoa, Uncle Phil, you sure you wouldn't
want Carlton to wear Aunt Viv's apron?

02:40.172 --> 02:41.196
No.

02:43.942 --> 02:46.069
Oh, Jazz, I need you to bring over
my blue jacket.

02:46.144 --> 02:49.341
Don't worry, man, I'll have it back to you
first thing tomorrow morning.

02:49.414 --> 02:50.881
Y ou won't even be able to tell I wore it.

02:50.949 --> 02:53.144
Jazz, what did you do to my jacket?

02:56.121 --> 02:58.385
Y ou told me to get it cleaned.

02:59.024 --> 03:00.616
So I washed it.

03:01.993 --> 03:05.394
I don't believe you, man,
first my CD player, now this.

03:05.464 --> 03:09.594
- Y ou make a doorknob look smart, man.
- No need to get testy.

03:10.435 --> 03:12.699
At least I got out all the A.1. sauce.

03:14.039 --> 03:15.165
Whoa, hold up.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.338
<i>Underdog's</i> on.

03:19.044 --> 03:21.569
<i>E</i> xcuse me, but I'm watching the <i>E</i> agles.

03:21.646 --> 03:23.238
Well, excuse me...

03:23.315 --> 03:26.546
but you once preferred the whimsy
of a y ogi and a Boo Boo.

03:27.285 --> 03:29.253
Will, I hardly know you.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.488
Will, put on your jacket.

03:32.557 --> 03:35.287
We're leaving for the press luncheon
in 10 minutes.

03:36.094 --> 03:39.188
Hey, have you been undressing
my Teddy Ruxpin again?

03:43.802 --> 03:48.000
- Vivian, you look so sexy.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

03:48.073 --> 03:49.904
Now go upstairs and change.

03:50.342 --> 03:52.776
What, don't you want to project
the right image?

03:52.944 --> 03:55.845
Hey, I'm happy that this fits over my belly.

03:56.248 --> 03:58.944
- Which reminds me, I'm hungry.
- Viv...

04:00.252 --> 04:01.412
Daddy?

04:01.486 --> 04:05.616
I am a young adult, and I have my rights.
If you force me to wear this, I'II...

04:06.291 --> 04:08.816
I'll hold my breath
until my face turns blue.

04:09.594 --> 04:12.154
Ashley, you're 13 years old,
you'll do what I say.

04:12.230 --> 04:15.097
- But that's not fair.
- Call a cop.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.531
Mommy!

04:17.736 --> 04:19.636
Well, I'm ready.

04:19.704 --> 04:22.571
I've been waiting all my life
to hear you say that.

04:23.642 --> 04:26.110
I meant,
I'm ready for the press conference.

04:26.178 --> 04:29.579
Y ou know, sometimes I lose sight
of why I want to be a judge.

04:29.648 --> 04:33.379
Then you open your mouth,
and it all comes flooding back.

04:33.451 --> 04:36.352
Thank you. See, Will, I inspire him.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.486
No, no, not yet. Not now, Jazz.

04:38.557 --> 04:42.323
Oh, no! No, you're on the one-yard line!
Fumble? Herschel, pick it up!

04:42.894 --> 04:46.762
Well, it's painfully obvious
that my presence is no longer required.

04:50.569 --> 04:53.697
Here, Carlton.
<i>E</i> ventually, you'll grow into it.

04:56.474 --> 05:00.376
<i>E</i> xcuse me, sir,
but how's your day been going so far?

05:00.445 --> 05:05.041
- Well, wonderful, Geoffrey, thank you.
- Well, down the toilet it goes.

05:15.794 --> 05:18.092
Judge Robertson,
what are you doing here, sir?

05:18.163 --> 05:20.688
Philip, it's good to see you again, my boy.

05:20.999 --> 05:23.968
How long has it been: 10, 15 years?

05:26.872 --> 05:30.273
- We just had dinner a few weeks ago, sir.
- We did?

05:31.176 --> 05:33.041
Did I leave here with my pants on?

05:33.111 --> 05:34.442
Y es.

05:34.512 --> 05:35.740
Oh, thank God.

05:37.682 --> 05:40.310
But that means
you must throw a lousy party.

05:41.620 --> 05:45.420
But enough about you, Philip.
Look, Philip, you got to help me.

05:46.825 --> 05:48.850
Y ou're the only one I can trust.

05:49.327 --> 05:52.819
I just heard that they found someone
to run against me.

05:52.898 --> 05:55.765
Judge, we discussed that over dinner.
I'm running against you.

05:55.834 --> 05:57.096
What?

05:57.903 --> 05:59.393
How dare you!

06:00.305 --> 06:01.795
Get out of my house!

06:02.240 --> 06:03.229
Out!

06:04.075 --> 06:06.100
Lionel, show him the door.

06:17.188 --> 06:19.656
Go, go, go, touchdown!

06:22.227 --> 06:24.821
Will, Will. Put that thing away.

06:24.896 --> 06:27.091
- Uncle Phil, they just tied it up.
- I don't care.

06:27.165 --> 06:28.632
- Mr. Banks.
- Y es.

06:32.203 --> 06:33.602
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

06:33.672 --> 06:36.072
And welcome to this afternoon's
press conference.

06:36.141 --> 06:39.907
It is my pleasure
to introduce to you Mr. Philip Banks.

06:43.048 --> 06:45.073
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen of the press...

06:45.150 --> 06:47.311
and thank you very much for coming.

06:47.619 --> 06:49.678
I'd like to take this opportunity...

06:49.754 --> 06:53.713
to formally announce my candidacy
for the office of Superior Court Judge.

06:54.893 --> 06:58.624
Thank you. I plan on restoring faith
in the judicial system.

06:58.697 --> 07:03.134
And I ask you: Do you really want six more
years of the same tired plea-bargaining?

07:03.201 --> 07:04.463
Y es, yes!

07:09.107 --> 07:10.096
What?

07:11.376 --> 07:13.810
Judge Robertson has been in office
six straight terms...

07:13.878 --> 07:15.812
how do you intend to break that streak?

07:15.880 --> 07:18.314
By focusing on the issues
and not personality.

07:18.383 --> 07:21.375
Once the voters see where I stand,
I'm sure I'll win this election.

07:21.453 --> 07:24.479
Y ou idiot, you don't even deserve
to sit on the bench.

07:29.527 --> 07:30.585
What?

07:33.298 --> 07:35.698
Judge Robertson.

07:38.536 --> 07:42.870
- I didn't know he had kids.
- He doesn't. And that's not his wife.

07:43.208 --> 07:45.699
And am I crazy
or does he look 10 years younger?

07:45.777 --> 07:47.972
That's unbelievable.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.109
Is that brisket I smell?

07:54.719 --> 07:57.153
- Lovely family.
- Thank you.

07:57.222 --> 07:58.814
- Who are they?
- Rented.

08:01.426 --> 08:06.056
Judge Robertson, how does it feel
to be running against your own student?

08:06.131 --> 08:08.156
Philip Banks is a gentleman...

08:08.233 --> 08:10.394
and one of the smartest students
I ever had.

08:10.468 --> 08:13.301
A man who would bring honor
to the bench.

08:13.371 --> 08:15.703
Don't get me wrong, I want the job.

08:17.842 --> 08:21.209
But I can't think of another person
that I would mind losing to...

08:21.279 --> 08:22.337
but this man here.

08:22.714 --> 08:24.181
I love you, my son.

08:24.916 --> 08:26.144
What a guy.

08:28.486 --> 08:30.920
Mr. Banks, what's your response?

08:37.195 --> 08:38.559
<i>E</i> xcuse me.

08:40.732 --> 08:44.030
Mr. Banks, we're looking for your nephew,
a William Smith.

08:44.736 --> 08:46.101
Oh, my God.

08:47.005 --> 08:49.132
It's over, it's all over.

08:51.242 --> 08:53.073
Are you Will Smith?

08:54.412 --> 08:57.279
No, Rahjim Shabaz, Muslim activist.
<i>Sa/aam a/aikum.</i>

08:58.516 --> 09:00.245
Will, what's wrong?

09:02.087 --> 09:04.715
Y ou're under arrest, Shabaz.

09:22.474 --> 09:23.839
Sit down, Smith.

09:24.309 --> 09:27.745
Oh, okay, it's like that, right? All right.

09:27.912 --> 09:31.143
It's cool. I'm gonna sit down.
All right, I'm sitting down right here.

09:31.216 --> 09:33.411
And you think
that just 'cause you got that badge...

09:33.485 --> 09:35.453
and all your tough cop friends
walking around...

09:35.520 --> 09:36.885
and your cute little walkie-talkie...

09:36.955 --> 09:39.719
that you can talk to folks
any old way you want to do it.

09:39.791 --> 09:43.158
Well, I tell you right now,
if you ain't have all that stuff...

09:43.228 --> 09:46.527
we'd be squawking a different language
up in here right now.

09:49.234 --> 09:51.031
What are you trying to say?

09:55.640 --> 09:59.041
I think I made myself real clear
when I said what I just said.

10:00.044 --> 10:01.033
Y eah.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.048
Y eah, I guess you did.

10:04.115 --> 10:06.208
Mr. Officer, your stuff fell off.

10:09.420 --> 10:11.047
Hip-hop cop.

10:12.223 --> 10:14.453
Blue looks nice on you, too.

10:14.526 --> 10:17.757
Match that big blue vein
throbbing in your neck right now.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.361
I'm Philip Banks, the boy's attorney.

10:23.434 --> 10:25.664
I'd like to speak to my nephew alone,
please.

10:25.737 --> 10:27.466
What's up now, tough guy?

10:31.743 --> 10:34.143
- No problem, sir.
- That's right.

10:41.052 --> 10:44.249
- I guess we told him, right, Uncle Phil?
- Sit down.

10:49.460 --> 10:53.089
Will, how could you get $2,000 worth
of parking tickets...

10:53.164 --> 10:55.792
when I told you
to get rid of that car months ago?

10:55.867 --> 10:59.394
Actually, I did get rid of it.
See, I gave it to a friend.

11:01.039 --> 11:02.472
Look, I swear to you, Uncle Phil...

11:02.540 --> 11:04.235
there ain't no way
I got them parking tickets.

11:04.309 --> 11:05.833
Look at the printout. Huh?

11:07.912 --> 11:11.075
"Snuffy's Chicken Shack,
Big Ben's Barbeque...

11:11.149 --> 11:14.312
"Alice's All Nude Review."
What do you call this?

11:15.687 --> 11:17.484
One hell of a Friday night.

11:19.023 --> 11:21.116
Can I see that, Uncle Phil?

11:25.196 --> 11:28.688
Wait a minute, Uncle Phil,
these are all Jazz's hangouts.

11:28.766 --> 11:31.098
He must have gotten
all these parking tickets.

11:31.169 --> 11:33.660
I'm serious. I told him I'd kill him.

11:34.672 --> 11:37.835
How could he go
to Alice's All Nude Review without me?

11:40.111 --> 11:42.705
Well, hello, Philip, my boy.
Welcome to City Hall.

11:42.780 --> 11:46.739
Thank you. Will, wait in the car
and don't even touch the steering wheel.

11:46.851 --> 11:47.840
Y es, sir.

11:50.054 --> 11:52.716
Hey, Judge. Judge. Judge, check it out.

11:52.790 --> 11:54.985
Look, brother ran into a little misfortune.
Right?

11:55.059 --> 11:57.254
I got like $2,000 worth of parking tickets.

11:57.328 --> 12:01.196
I was just wondering, I don't know,
maybe you might be able to do a...

12:04.302 --> 12:06.395
I thought he was selling condoms.

12:12.944 --> 12:15.208
I apologize for my nephew, Judge.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.738
And I hope this little incident didn't cause
any undue embarrassment. I mean...

12:18.816 --> 12:21.808
- the press is going to have a field day.
- Well, I certainly hope so.

12:21.886 --> 12:23.046
This is just the beginning.

12:23.121 --> 12:25.351
Y ou know,
I was browsing through the police files...

12:25.423 --> 12:27.687
and bingo, up pops your nephew's name.

12:27.759 --> 12:30.125
Parking tickets up the ying-yang.

12:30.194 --> 12:32.321
So I busted his bony butt.

12:33.298 --> 12:34.356
Pretty good, huh?

12:34.432 --> 12:37.230
- <i>E</i> xcuse me?
- Oh, wake up, knucklehead.

12:37.302 --> 12:39.202
Y ou're in the big leagues now.

12:39.270 --> 12:41.795
I may be old, I may be senile...

12:41.873 --> 12:44.865
and I haven't been able to find my car
for the past half hour...

12:44.942 --> 12:48.639
but I can beat your butt
in a political campaign any day.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.907
Y ou're dead meat, Tiny.

13:09.233 --> 13:12.259
I always knew Will would be the downfall
of this family.

13:12.337 --> 13:14.635
But no one ever listens to me.

13:15.106 --> 13:17.597
What, honey? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

13:18.543 --> 13:20.204
I can't believe this.

13:20.278 --> 13:23.679
I mean, Will being arrested means
we're all going to be investigated.

13:23.748 --> 13:26.581
I mean, this is how
they knocked off Imelda Marcos.

13:26.951 --> 13:29.613
I'll just die if they touch my shoes.

13:32.290 --> 13:34.850
I'd die if you made your own bed.

13:36.027 --> 13:37.961
Get off me, man, just get off me.

13:38.763 --> 13:40.628
Thank you, thank you.

13:40.698 --> 13:42.427
Will.

13:42.567 --> 13:44.626
I'm so glad you're home.

13:45.036 --> 13:48.164
Carlton said
you were probably doing 5 to 10 by now.

13:49.474 --> 13:52.238
- Are you all right, sweetheart?
- Y eah, I'm fine, Aunt Viv.

13:52.310 --> 13:55.939
- Well, good, now I can break your legs.
- Vivian, Vivian, I'll handle this.

13:56.013 --> 13:57.810
Now we have to make a statement
for the press.

13:57.882 --> 14:00.373
So put on an apron, grab the cookie jar.

14:00.451 --> 14:01.713
Forget it.

14:02.253 --> 14:04.653
And I ate all the cookies before lunch.

14:05.590 --> 14:08.184
Okay, okay,
then we'll have to grab the cutest kid.

14:09.994 --> 14:13.930
Ashley, you'll do. Come on, smile,
sweetheart. Let's go, Vivian, come on.

14:14.632 --> 14:15.724
Okay.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.132
Are you ready to talk to us now?

14:18.202 --> 14:19.794
Man, this has been
the worst day of my life.

14:19.871 --> 14:22.772
And as soon as I see Jazz,
I'm going to make it the worst day of his.

14:22.840 --> 14:26.276
Will, you seem embittered.
Jail will do that to a man.

14:26.344 --> 14:29.074
Now that you've done hard time,
a book may be in order.

14:29.147 --> 14:32.412
Criminals sell. I can sell criminals.
Y ou're a criminal.

14:33.985 --> 14:38.149
Really? And you're too short
to ride the teacup ride at Disneyland.

14:40.358 --> 14:43.088
What's up, Will?
Man, what's with all the reporters?

14:43.161 --> 14:45.959
I ain't seen no chalk outlines or nothing.

14:47.665 --> 14:49.929
That's 'cause I didn't murder you yet.

14:50.435 --> 14:52.528
What's got your BVDs in a bunch?

14:53.371 --> 14:57.432
Well, for starters, you ruined
the most important day in my uncle's life.

14:57.508 --> 14:59.840
Haagen-Dazs opened in Bel-Air?

15:00.144 --> 15:02.635
Jazz, I trusted you with my ride
over the summer...

15:02.713 --> 15:04.874
and you got $2,000 worth
of parking tickets.

15:04.949 --> 15:06.473
And you didn't even tell me.

15:06.551 --> 15:08.883
Y ou're right, I should have told you.

15:10.221 --> 15:12.746
Will, I got $2,000 worth of parking tickets.

15:14.058 --> 15:18.552
- What do you plan to do about that, Jazz?
- I'll take care of it, man. I promise.

15:21.399 --> 15:23.026
Can I borrow $2,000?

15:24.168 --> 15:26.898
This is not a joke, man. I trusted you, Jazz.

15:26.971 --> 15:29.599
I trusted you,
and you got me tossed into jail.

15:30.041 --> 15:31.838
Friends don't do that to each other, man.

15:31.909 --> 15:34.139
I mean, friends are supposed to be there
for each other.

15:34.212 --> 15:36.373
Friends aren't supposed to set you up
to take a fall.

15:36.447 --> 15:40.281
And most importantly, friends are
supposed to be honest with each other.

15:40.351 --> 15:43.149
And you obviously don't fit that mold.

15:43.221 --> 15:45.712
So from this point on,
you can consider our friendship over.

15:45.790 --> 15:47.189
Y ou're no longer welcome in this house.

15:47.258 --> 15:50.659
And I'd appreciate it
if you just got the hell out of my crib.

15:53.064 --> 15:55.760
Ain't you going to even bother
to throw me out?

15:58.236 --> 15:59.965
Y ou're not worth it, man.

16:09.013 --> 16:10.674
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Will.

16:12.016 --> 16:14.780
Hey, hey G,
you want to go watch some <i>Underdog?</i>

16:14.852 --> 16:17.116
Why, do I look like a moron?

16:24.695 --> 16:26.219
Banks residence.

16:26.297 --> 16:29.698
G, look, if that's Jazz,
tell him I do not want to talk to him.

16:29.767 --> 16:32.133
It's for me. It's my accountant.

16:34.705 --> 16:36.434
So what are you wearing?

16:41.579 --> 16:44.548
Hey, Carlton, man, how about we
shoot down to The Wing King, man...

16:44.615 --> 16:46.173
get a big bucket of ribs?

16:46.250 --> 16:47.842
Do I look like Jimmie Walker?

16:50.221 --> 16:51.813
Forget you then, man.

16:53.157 --> 16:54.749
Hey, hey, hey, Ashley.

16:54.825 --> 16:57.293
I just got the new video boxing.
Come on, you want to play?

16:57.361 --> 16:59.329
Sorry, homey, homework.

17:02.900 --> 17:03.924
Hey, Hil, you want to...

17:04.001 --> 17:06.834
No, Will, I don't want ribs,
I don't want to wax your ride...

17:06.904 --> 17:09.270
and I don't even know what a Chumpy is.

17:12.410 --> 17:14.275
Okay. All right.

17:14.345 --> 17:18.076
It's like that, right? It's like that.
Y'all going to flee me like that, right?

17:18.148 --> 17:21.811
My suggestion to you, my despondent,
desperate, ne'er-do-well cousin...

17:21.886 --> 17:24.752
is to make amends
with your partner in delinquency.

17:25.656 --> 17:26.781
What?

17:28.859 --> 17:31.760
Call him, Will. I'm sure Jazz is sorry.

17:31.829 --> 17:34.525
Why should I call him
after what he did to me?

17:35.166 --> 17:39.398
Y ou know, forget it. I don't need him.
I don't need you. I don't need nobody.

19:03.220 --> 19:05.780
I just want to get up to my room,
Uncle Phil.

19:06.123 --> 19:07.818
I don't want no trouble.

19:08.592 --> 19:10.992
It's all right, Will, I'm not mad anymore.

19:11.962 --> 19:13.896
- Oh, my God, Philip, look at this.
- What?

19:13.964 --> 19:15.454
It's all in the paper.

19:15.533 --> 19:19.128
They got a picture of me
throwing a reporter in the pool.

19:20.037 --> 19:22.801
What a wonderful way
to start my campaign.

19:22.873 --> 19:26.365
My nephew gets arrested.
My wife looks like...

19:27.211 --> 19:29.202
y ou look wonderful, sweetheart.

19:30.948 --> 19:32.176
I don't know.

19:32.516 --> 19:35.781
Actually, Aunt Viv, you got a, kind of a...

19:35.853 --> 19:39.186
homicidal, sumo-wrestler thing going.

19:41.492 --> 19:43.357
Oh, but you working it, girl.

19:44.795 --> 19:47.025
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

19:47.131 --> 19:48.689
What are you doing here?

19:48.766 --> 19:51.030
I was out
for my morning constitutional and...

19:51.435 --> 19:53.926
I must have walked farther than I thought.

19:54.038 --> 19:56.563
But since I'm here, bean pie for all.

19:57.208 --> 20:00.575
Y ou know, just my way of saying...
y ou know.

20:01.112 --> 20:04.479
- Oh, that's very nice, Jazz.
- Thank you, Jazz.

20:05.349 --> 20:07.909
I guess you two want to be alone.

20:09.420 --> 20:12.082
I don't get it, Philip,
why did he give us a bean pie?

20:12.156 --> 20:14.454
What am I, Freud? Grab a fork, Vivian.

20:17.528 --> 20:18.620
Well...

20:19.663 --> 20:21.392
I guess I ought to be going.

20:21.465 --> 20:24.263
Y ou probably got college applications
to fill out.

20:26.504 --> 20:28.665
Well, yeah, actually, I do.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.336
Y ou probably want to hang out
with educated people...

20:32.409 --> 20:35.276
who drink their malt liquor in a glass.

20:36.213 --> 20:38.113
What are you talking about, Jazz?

20:38.182 --> 20:41.174
Face it, Will. Y ou're going to go off
to college to be somebody...

20:41.252 --> 20:44.153
and I'm going to be stuck here
living foot to mouth.

20:47.558 --> 20:49.822
I think you mean hand to mouth, Jazz.

20:50.528 --> 20:53.361
Don't try to impress me
with your fancy education.

20:54.665 --> 20:57.429
Y ou're going to go off next year
to some big old college...

20:57.501 --> 21:00.902
and I'll be sitting here by the phone
waiting for you to call.

21:02.239 --> 21:06.266
- Y ou're not making any sense, Jazz.
- Y ou used to think that was cute.

21:11.749 --> 21:15.742
Wait a minute. Y ou mean this whole thing
is about me going off to college?

21:16.620 --> 21:18.349
Oh, comes the dawn.

21:19.690 --> 21:21.851
My mother told me you was no good.

21:22.693 --> 21:24.957
I knew I should have listened to her.

21:25.396 --> 21:28.854
See, I promised myself
I wasn't going to cry.

21:32.102 --> 21:34.832
- Look, come on, Jazz.
- Get your hands off of me.

21:35.439 --> 21:38.704
I'm not a faucet to be turned on and off
at your whim.

21:38.776 --> 21:40.266
I have emotions.

21:43.113 --> 21:47.277
Jazz, yes, it's true that I'm going off
to college, man, but...

21:47.351 --> 21:49.751
Come on, you like family to me.

21:51.055 --> 21:53.580
Jazz, just 'cause somebody moves away
from the family...

21:53.657 --> 21:55.318
that doesn't mean they break up.

21:55.392 --> 21:58.919
That just means that, you know, the family
has to work harder to stay together.

21:58.996 --> 22:00.987
Y ou understand what I'm saying?

22:07.071 --> 22:08.197
No.

22:09.540 --> 22:11.565
But at least you talking to me.

22:11.642 --> 22:14.907
Come on, Jazz, you know
you're always going to be my homey.

22:16.547 --> 22:18.515
Why didn't you say that in the first place?

22:18.582 --> 22:21.016
I did say that.
Why don't you clean out your ears?

22:21.085 --> 22:23.645
Now, I know you ain't talking
about nobody's ears.

22:23.721 --> 22:26.849
Hey, come on, man, let's jet down
to the mall, pick up some Chumpies.

22:26.924 --> 22:30.690
Will, could you do one thing for me?

22:30.761 --> 22:33.286
Y ou know, just for old time's sake.

22:35.833 --> 22:37.391
Sure, no problem, man.

22:48.045 --> 22:50.445
Jazz, I trusted you with my ride
over the summer...

22:50.514 --> 22:52.243
and you got me tossed...

22:52.316 --> 22:53.647
I mean shoot.

22:59.890 --> 23:01.448
I said, "shoot," Mom.

23:03.894 --> 23:06.055
"I raised my boy better than that."

23:07.498 --> 23:09.557
"Oh, God."
