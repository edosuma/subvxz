<i>In last week's episode of</i> Soap,

00:04.070 --> 00:05.571
<i>Carol told Jodie</i>

00:05.572 --> 00:07.072
<i>she'd love to marry him.</i>

00:07.073 --> 00:09.575
<i>But Carol's father was</i>
<i>not in love with the idea.</i>

00:09.576 --> 00:12.077
<i>Chester is coming home</i>
<i>to his loved ones</i>

00:12.078 --> 00:14.079
<i>and would love it if he knew</i>
<i>who they were.</i>

00:14.080 --> 00:17.082
<i>Mary's professor would love</i>
<i>to see more of Mary...</i>

00:17.083 --> 00:18.083
<i>but Mary would love it</i>

00:18.084 --> 00:20.085
<i>if her professor would</i>
<i>leave her alone.</i>

00:20.086 --> 00:22.087
<i>Burt has met Mary's professor</i>

00:22.088 --> 00:24.089
<i>and would love Mary</i>
<i>to leave school.</i>

00:24.090 --> 00:26.091
<i>Eunice would love</i>
<i>to see more of Dutch,</i>

00:26.092 --> 00:27.593
<i>who she loves, but she can't,</i>

00:27.594 --> 00:29.595
<i>because Dutch is</i>
<i>running from the police</i>

00:29.596 --> 00:30.596
<i>who would love to catch him.</i>

00:30.597 --> 00:33.098
<i>Elaine told Danny she loves him</i>

00:33.099 --> 00:36.101
<i>and hopes it's not too late</i>
<i>for him to love her too.</i>

00:36.102 --> 00:37.603
<i>Danny would love to love her.</i>

00:37.604 --> 00:40.105
<i>And Sally told Burt</i>
<i>she loves him,</i>

00:40.106 --> 00:42.608
<i>and she'd love to be his lover.</i>

00:42.609 --> 00:44.109
<i>Confused?</i>

00:44.110 --> 00:46.112
<i>You won't be after</i>
<i>this week's episode of...</i> Soap.

00:52.118 --> 00:54.119
<i>This is the story</i>

<i>Jessica Tate,</i>

00:56.122 --> 00:58.624

01:37.163 --> 01:40.165
So you see, colonel,
if we leave before dusk,

01:40.166 --> 01:42.167
we could seize and destroy
that bunker.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.169
And that would be
a good thing to do, you say.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.671
It's the only logical step

01:45.672 --> 01:48.674
in the liberation of France.

01:48.675 --> 01:49.675
Bentley...

01:50.677 --> 01:52.678
Could you help me?
Sure.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.179
My wife
will be down in a moment.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.182
Oh.
What does she look like?

01:57.684 --> 02:00.686
Dumpy broad, short black hair...

02:00.687 --> 02:02.188
nose like a fish.

02:03.690 --> 02:04.690
What's her name?

02:04.691 --> 02:06.191
Eric.

02:06.192 --> 02:08.193
Thanks.

02:08.193 --> 02:09.695
The bunker, colonel.

02:09.696 --> 02:13.198
Major, are you sure
that I'm "Colonel" Tate?

02:13.199 --> 02:15.201
Positive, sir.

02:17.203 --> 02:18.204
Boland...

02:21.708 --> 02:22.708
What is that?
Steak.

02:22.709 --> 02:23.709
It's burnt!

02:23.710 --> 02:25.211
You like it that way.

02:27.213 --> 02:28.714
Good morning, darling.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.716
Ah, Monica. Right?

02:30.717 --> 02:33.218
Jessica.

02:33.219 --> 02:35.220
Chester, dear.
I'm your wife.

02:35.221 --> 02:39.225
You are? Hey, great.

02:41.227 --> 02:42.728
We get along, don't we?

02:42.729 --> 02:44.730
Yes.

02:44.731 --> 02:45.971
How are you feeling today, Dad?

02:46.733 --> 02:47.733
Dad?

02:47.734 --> 02:50.235
I just introduced myself to him
in the bathroom.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.237
But darling,
he only remembers things

02:52.238 --> 02:53.739
for a little while.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.241
About five seconds.

02:56.242 --> 02:57.242
This is Billy, Chester.

02:57.243 --> 03:00.746
Oh... Billy Chester.

03:00.747 --> 03:03.248
No, I'm your son, Billy.

03:03.249 --> 03:06.752
My son? My own son.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.254
Oh, what a wonderful thing.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.257
A son, Geraldine.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.761
A fine, strong son.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.763

03:31.277 --> 03:32.277
No, thanks.

03:32.278 --> 03:35.280
Keep it from the rest
of the troops,

03:35.281 --> 03:36.782
but the colonel is a lunatic.

03:37.784 --> 03:39.284
Good morning.

03:39.285 --> 03:41.286
Good morning.
Have we met?

03:41.287 --> 03:43.789
Begging the colonel's pardon,
sir,

03:43.790 --> 03:44.790
but what about our mission?

03:44.791 --> 03:48.294
Oh! Oh, quite right, major.
Quite right.

03:52.298 --> 03:54.800
Promise me you'll be here
when I return, Marjorie.

03:54.801 --> 03:55.801
Yes.

03:55.802 --> 03:56.802
Well, I'm off.

03:56.803 --> 03:58.805
I'll say.

Mother, what are we
gonna do about Daddy?

04:09.816 --> 04:11.316
What do you mean?

04:11.317 --> 04:13.318
I think he needs to be somewhere

04:13.319 --> 04:15.320
where he can get proper care.

04:15.321 --> 04:16.822
He can't get that here.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.322
Maybe there's some place

04:18.324 --> 04:20.325
that has some sort of therapy
that could help him.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.327
Oh, Eunice.

04:22.328 --> 04:26.832
You mean put Daddy away...
in an institution?

04:26.833 --> 04:28.333
But darling, the doctor said

04:28.334 --> 04:30.836
that he might snap out of it
any time.

04:31.838 --> 04:32.838
And maybe not.

04:32.839 --> 04:36.842
Eunice, I don't
want him to come out of it

04:36.843 --> 04:38.844
with a bunch of strangers.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.345
I mean, if he looks up

04:40.346 --> 04:42.848
and sees a bunch of faces
he doesn't recognize,

04:42.849 --> 04:45.351
he might not know
he's come out of it.

04:53.359 --> 04:57.362
Dad and Gramps just blew up
Mr. Kirby's garage.

04:57.363 --> 05:01.366
Mr. Kirby's going
to be very upset.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.869
Especially since he was
parking his car at the time.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.381
Here it is.
I packed it up for you.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.382
Thanks.

05:17.383 --> 05:18.383
I think everything is here.

05:18.384 --> 05:19.885
Great. Uh, before I forget,

05:19.886 --> 05:21.887
I wanna give you back your key.

05:21.888 --> 05:22.888
Why don't you keep it?

05:22.889 --> 05:24.389
What am I gonna do with it?

05:24.390 --> 05:26.391
Well, you never know.
Maybe someday, you'll...

05:26.392 --> 05:27.893
Then I'll ring the bell.

05:27.894 --> 05:28.894
Just because
you're getting married

05:28.895 --> 05:30.395
doesn't mean we have to stop...

05:30.396 --> 05:31.396
It does.

05:31.397 --> 05:32.397
Come on.

05:32.398 --> 05:34.399
My blue v-neck. You know,
I thought I lost that.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.902
Listen, you know
a lot of guys have mistresses.

05:36.903 --> 05:38.404
You'll have me.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.406
But that is not mine, Dennis.

05:41.407 --> 05:42.407
That is yours.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.408
No, it isn't.

05:43.409 --> 05:44.910
Well, it's not mine.

05:44.911 --> 05:46.912
Sure, it is. You bought it
at the flea market.

05:46.913 --> 05:50.415
Dennis, never in my life
have I bought a ceramic hippo.

05:50.416 --> 05:51.416
It's yours.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.918
Why is it mine?
Because you hate it?

05:52.919 --> 05:53.919
Fine. It's not yours, it's mine.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.921
I love it.
I wish I had two.

05:55.922 --> 05:56.922
All right, I'll keep the hippo.

05:56.923 --> 05:59.424
If you think she won't like
the hippo, I'll take it.

05:59.425 --> 06:00.926
It has nothing to do with her.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.427
Hey,
it doesn't go with her decor.

06:02.428 --> 06:03.929
I understand.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.431
It clashes with Early Uptight.

06:06.933 --> 06:07.933
Goodbye, Dennis.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.434
Jodie, wait. I'm
sorry. Please, wait.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.436
What do you want me to do,
crawl?

06:11.437 --> 06:13.438
I mean, I rebuff you
just one little time...

06:13.439 --> 06:15.440
Rebuffed?

06:15.441 --> 06:16.942
You got married.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.944
Well, still, how long are you
gonna make me pay for it?

06:18.945 --> 06:20.946
That's not what I'm doing,
Dennis.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.447
That's not what I'm doing
at all.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.449
Oh, come on. Don't tell me
you're marrying Carol

06:24.450 --> 06:25.450
because you've
suddenly gone straight.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.953
No, I'm marrying her
partly because I should

06:27.954 --> 06:29.454
and partly because I want to.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.457
And what about us?
I thought you loved me.

06:33.960 --> 06:34.960
I do.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.964
Then how can you marry her?

06:38.965 --> 06:40.966
Dennis, she's having my baby.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.468
So she's having your baby.
So what?

06:43.469 --> 06:44.970
And, anyway,
how do you know it's yours?

06:44.971 --> 06:46.471
It's mine.

06:46.472 --> 06:47.472
I mean, it could be anybody's.

06:47.473 --> 06:48.473
It probably is.

06:48.474 --> 06:49.975
Dennis, come on.

06:49.976 --> 06:51.977
Jodie, the little slut
has got more guys jumping her

06:51.978 --> 06:52.979
than the hurdles.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.983
And you're gonna
be the jerk that supports her.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.985
Well, I hope you're happy
with spit-up on your shoulder

06:59.986 --> 07:01.146
and a milkman with your wife.

07:21.007 --> 07:22.007
Eunice.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.513
Eunice!

07:28.514 --> 07:29.515
Damn!

07:32.018 --> 07:34.019
Dutch!

07:34.020 --> 07:35.020
Eunice, is that you?

07:35.021 --> 07:37.022
Who is it, please?

07:37.023 --> 07:39.024
What do you mean, who is it?
It's me.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.525
Dutch!

07:40.526 --> 07:42.027
Eunice, keep it down, will you?

07:42.028 --> 07:44.529
We don't want the whole
world to know we're up here.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.031
Oh, it's okay.
Only Mrs. Mendelbaum knows.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.532
Who's Mrs. Mendelbaum?

07:47.533 --> 07:49.034
She's the super
of this building.

07:49.035 --> 07:51.036
She buzzed me in.
Didn't she buzz you in?

07:51.037 --> 07:52.537
Eunice,
I just escaped from prison.

07:52.538 --> 07:53.539
Nobody has to buzz me in.

07:55.041 --> 07:59.044
Eunice, what are you
doing on that roof?

07:59.045 --> 08:01.046
You said to meet you on a roof.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.048
So here I am, on a roof...
meeting.

08:03.049 --> 08:06.051
Eunice, I said
814 Delancey Street.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.052
You're on 816 Delancey Street!

08:07.053 --> 08:09.554
You said 816 Delancey Street.

08:09.555 --> 08:10.555
No, I didn't.

08:10.556 --> 08:12.557
Yes, you did.
You said 816 Delaney Street.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.059
I know this

08:14.060 --> 08:15.560
because your birthday is
August 16th.

08:15.561 --> 08:16.561
Eight-sixteen, see?

08:16.562 --> 08:19.564
Eunice, my birthday is
August the 14th.

08:19.565 --> 08:22.067
Oh! Oh...

08:22.068 --> 08:25.071
Well, Dutch,
come over to my roof, okay?

08:27.573 --> 08:28.934
No, Eunice. It's
better this way...

08:30.076 --> 08:31.076
because this is goodbye.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.078
What?

08:33.078 --> 08:34.078
This is goodbye.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.580
Are you crazy?

08:35.581 --> 08:38.082
You call me down to a slum
in the middle of the night

08:38.083 --> 08:39.083
for goodbye?

08:39.085 --> 08:40.585
Well, yeah.

08:40.586 --> 08:43.587
I come down here
on a subway full of flashers,

08:43.589 --> 08:47.092
right into the middle
of junkie heaven for goodbye?

08:48.094 --> 08:49.594
Stay right there, Dutch.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.596
Don't move from your roof.

08:51.597 --> 08:54.599
I'm coming right over there
to push you off.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.101
Eunice! Eunice!
This is crazy.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.603
You can't be involved with me.
It's no good for you.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.105
And if I'm with you,
I'm gonna get caught.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.606
Don't worry about it.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.108
In another two minutes,
you're gonna be dead!

09:03.109 --> 09:05.110
Eunice! Don't try
to come across there.

09:05.111 --> 09:07.112
You could fall!

09:07.113 --> 09:09.114
Eunice? Eunice,
what is it?

09:09.115 --> 09:10.615
I'm scared of heights, Dutch.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.117
Stay right there.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.118
Oh, I feel nauseous.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.119
Don't move.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.120
What if I throw up?

09:15.121 --> 09:16.121
Don't look down.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.623
Oh, I hate you!

09:18.624 --> 09:20.125
Eunice, I love you.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.626
Yeah, you love me so much
you're leaving me.

09:21.627 --> 09:23.128
But I'm doing it for you.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.129
I'm leaving you for you.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.630
Don't do me any favors.

09:25.631 --> 09:28.633
I don't want you to leave me.
I hate you.

09:28.634 --> 09:30.635
No, I don't. I love you.

09:30.636 --> 09:33.638
Okay. Okay.
I won't do it.

09:33.639 --> 09:34.720
I'll take you with me.
Oh...

09:40.646 --> 09:41.646
Dutch.
Eunice.

09:41.647 --> 09:42.647
Oh, Dutch...

09:42.648 --> 09:45.650
Eunice, we're six stories up.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.152
We can't make love in mid-air.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.155
What do you think,
I'm a dragonfly?

09:51.157 --> 09:52.157
Back up, honey.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.158
Okay, darling.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.159
Listen, here's the plan.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.161
My grandmother
has a little farm,

09:56.162 --> 09:57.662
upstate New York.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.664
Now, nobody knows it's there.

09:59.665 --> 10:01.666
I'm gonna give you my directions
how to get there.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.168
And you read 'em very carefully.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.669
And I'll be there
tomorrow night.

10:04.670 --> 10:05.670
Oh, Dutch!

10:05.671 --> 10:08.673
A farm, our own little farm!

10:08.674 --> 10:10.175
Oh, I'm so happy.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.676
Oh...

10:11.677 --> 10:12.677
Honey?

10:12.678 --> 10:15.180
Yes, darling.
Let go.

10:15.181 --> 10:18.183
Here. Here's
the directions.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.684
Here.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.186
Now, you come as soon
as you can.

10:21.187 --> 10:24.689
Okay. Goodbye, my darling,
and be careful.

10:24.690 --> 10:29.194
Ah, don't hug me.
Just kiss me.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.195
I'd better go.

10:30.196 --> 10:32.197
And remember, mum's the word.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.698
Okay. Shh.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.201
Mum's the word.

10:39.205 --> 10:40.706
Mrs. Mendelbaum!

11:03.729 --> 11:05.730
Where is it?

11:05.731 --> 11:07.733
I smelled it
coming up the driveway!

11:08.734 --> 11:11.736
Oh! I love popcorn.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.238
You know, when I go
to the movies,

11:13.239 --> 11:14.739
it's just to eat the popcorn.

11:14.740 --> 11:15.740
I don't care what's playing.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.242
Me too.

11:17.243 --> 11:20.745
You know, one day
when you were 2 years old,

11:20.746 --> 11:22.247
I gave you some popcorn,

11:22.248 --> 11:24.750
and you shoved it
up your little nose.

11:29.255 --> 11:33.759
It wasn't a sad story.
What's the matter?

11:35.261 --> 11:36.262
I'm pregnant.

11:38.764 --> 11:42.267
Oh, Corinne.
Oh, That's wonderful!

11:42.268 --> 11:44.769
I mean,
that is really wonderful.

11:44.770 --> 11:45.771
No?

11:47.273 --> 11:49.774
It's a terrible time
to have a baby.

11:49.775 --> 11:53.278
Tim can't find a job,
and we're living here.

11:53.279 --> 11:54.779
He's so depressed.

11:54.780 --> 11:57.282
How can I have a baby
when everything's wrong?

11:57.283 --> 12:00.286
You mean you want to wait
until everything's right?

12:01.787 --> 12:03.288
You might never have a baby.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.293
But you see...

12:08.294 --> 12:09.794
when I thought of me pregnant,

12:09.795 --> 12:12.797
I kind of pictured it
differently, you know.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.799
Like, I pictured

12:14.800 --> 12:18.303
a little Cape Cod house
with a vegetable garden,

12:18.304 --> 12:20.805
and Tim going off to work,

12:20.806 --> 12:22.807
and me fixing food

12:22.808 --> 12:25.310
in my little country kitchen.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.812
The only thing I got
right was the food.

12:27.813 --> 12:30.315
It's just not how I pictured it.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.318
Nothing ever is.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.561
Do you think it would be wrong
if I didn't have the baby?

12:37.823 --> 12:40.325
It isn't a question of wrong.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.827
But I do think
that if you don't want a baby,

12:42.828 --> 12:44.329
then you shouldn't have a baby.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.332
You know what?

12:47.333 --> 12:49.835
I think you want the baby.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.339
I do.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.841
It's just...
I'm afraid to have a baby

12:56.842 --> 12:57.842
when we have nothing.

12:57.843 --> 13:01.846
Oh... you have
more than nothing.

13:01.847 --> 13:03.348
I mean,
you may not have the kitchen

13:03.349 --> 13:05.351
and the garden and the house,
but you have Tim.

13:06.352 --> 13:09.854
He loves you very much.

13:09.855 --> 13:12.857
That's much better than
a Cape Cod kitchen, Corinne.

13:12.858 --> 13:14.359
It's a Cape Cod house, Ma.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.861
Much better
than a Cape Cod house, Corinne.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.363
I know.

13:20.366 --> 13:23.869
Why do you want
to live on Cape Cod?

13:26.372 --> 13:28.373
I mean, it's very damp, Corinne.

13:28.374 --> 13:30.876
You're never gonna
have a nice hairdo.

13:31.877 --> 13:33.378
I don't wanna live on Cape Cod.

13:33.379 --> 13:36.382
Then why do you want
a house there?

13:38.884 --> 13:39.885
It's a type of house, Ma.

13:42.388 --> 13:43.889
Oh.

13:45.891 --> 13:47.392
You're scared, aren't you?

13:48.394 --> 13:53.898
You know, every time
I was pregnant, I was scared.

13:53.899 --> 13:54.899
I was always afraid

13:54.900 --> 13:56.401
I wouldn't know
how to be a mother...

13:56.402 --> 13:58.403
although I already was a mother.

13:58.404 --> 13:59.904
But I was always scared

13:59.905 --> 14:01.906
that I wouldn't know
how to do it.

14:01.907 --> 14:02.908
And I did it.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.910
Do you think
I'd be a good mother?

14:05.911 --> 14:08.913
Oh, you'll be
a wonderful mother...

14:08.914 --> 14:09.915
Like me.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.420
It's kind of exciting, you know?

14:15.421 --> 14:16.921
I know.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.423
I'm gonna have a baby.

14:18.424 --> 14:21.426
You told me.

14:21.427 --> 14:22.927
A baby!

14:22.928 --> 14:25.930
A baby!

14:25.931 --> 14:28.934
My baby is going to have a baby.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.441
Now, I don't want you to think

14:36.442 --> 14:37.942
that I started that train strike

14:37.943 --> 14:39.444
just to drive you home.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.446
Thanks for the ride.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.947
You have incredible eyes.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.950
No, they cross.

14:45.951 --> 14:47.952
Listen, I've got a headache.

14:47.953 --> 14:49.393
Could I trouble you
for some aspirin?

14:49.955 --> 14:51.456
I don't think we have any.

14:51.457 --> 14:52.957
Could you look?

14:52.958 --> 14:56.962
Oh, yes. Wait right here.

15:23.489 --> 15:24.989
Hello...

15:24.990 --> 15:26.991
Oh...
Hi.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.493
Jeez, I'm sorry.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.495
We thought we were alone.
Obviously.

15:30.496 --> 15:31.996
Hi.

15:31.997 --> 15:32.997
Hey, Ma.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.499
Sit down.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.501
Professor Martins
was just having some aspirin,

15:36.502 --> 15:38.002
and then he's leaving, so sit.

15:38.003 --> 15:40.004
Oh, no, no, it's okay.
We really have to go.

15:40.005 --> 15:42.006
Oh, don't
be silly. Stay.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.007
There's no reason to leave.

15:43.008 --> 15:44.509
Oh, no, that's okay.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.010
We have tickets
to go see <i>Chorus Line.</i>

15:46.011 --> 15:48.012
Oh, forget it.
It's a terrible play.

15:48.013 --> 15:50.515
It got awful reviews.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.517
Don't waste your
time. Stay here.

15:52.518 --> 15:55.019
But Ma, <i>Chorus Line</i>
has been a hit

15:55.020 --> 15:56.521
for a couple of years.

15:56.522 --> 15:57.522
Oh, <i>Chorus Line.</i>

15:57.523 --> 15:58.523
Yeah.

15:58.524 --> 16:01.526
I thought you said <i>Conga Line.</i>

16:01.527 --> 16:03.027
Because <i>Conga Line</i>
was a terrible play.

16:03.028 --> 16:06.030
No, it's <i>Chorus Line</i>
we're seeing.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.031
Good night, Ma.

16:07.032 --> 16:08.533
Good night, Mare.
Good night.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.034
Good night, professor.

16:10.035 --> 16:11.035
Good night. Good night.

16:15.541 --> 16:18.043
Well, did the devil
and Miss Jones leave?

16:19.545 --> 16:21.546
Hi, Chuck. Hello, Bob.
How are you?

16:21.547 --> 16:22.547
Uh, right now?

16:22.548 --> 16:24.048
How do you say...
looking for action.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.049
No, we were...

16:25.050 --> 16:26.551
just on our way out, Mary.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.052
Oh, no, don't go.
Stay.

16:28.053 --> 16:30.555
Sit down. Let's chat
for a while.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.056
Oh, not tonight, Mary.
Not tonight.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.559
Because tonight
I got me a date with a doll.

16:39.565 --> 16:40.565
How was the aspirin?

16:40.566 --> 16:42.567
Oh, fine. Fine.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.569
Good.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.571
Well, good night.

16:46.572 --> 16:49.073
Oh, so soon?

16:49.074 --> 16:51.076
Good night.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.078
How'd you get that?

16:54.079 --> 16:55.079
What, my neck or...

16:55.080 --> 16:59.083
No, that... that scar.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.085
Oh, oh, that. Well, uh...

17:01.086 --> 17:02.587
when my sister and I were young,

17:02.588 --> 17:04.088
we saw this Errol Flynn movie,

17:04.089 --> 17:07.090
and we were practicing a duel
with coat hangers, and she won.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.594
Oh, how horrible. Horrible.

17:09.595 --> 17:12.096
Well, it happened
over 36 years ago.

17:12.097 --> 17:13.178
I'm over the initial shock.

17:14.599 --> 17:15.599
Anatole!

17:15.601 --> 17:17.101
What in the world are you doing?

17:17.102 --> 17:18.603
Well, I'm just attracted to you,

17:18.604 --> 17:20.104
and I can't help
showing my feelings.

17:20.105 --> 17:21.105
Well, I can't help showing

17:21.106 --> 17:22.106
my feelings either.

17:22.107 --> 17:23.608
Get out.
Mary...

17:23.608 --> 17:24.608
Anatole, please.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.109
What are you doing?
No, wait.

17:40.626 --> 17:43.628
Well, I'm not just gonna
stand here.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.630
I'll go tell him...

17:45.631 --> 17:47.132
I'll tell him what?

17:48.634 --> 17:51.636
Look, Burt, do something.

17:51.637 --> 17:53.639
Do... what can I do? Do what?

17:56.141 --> 18:00.144
Oh, God! Get me away from here.

18:00.145 --> 18:02.647
Oh, boy!

18:03.649 --> 18:04.649
Well, you are lucky

18:04.650 --> 18:06.150
my husband wasn't here
to see this,

18:06.151 --> 18:08.153
because you would
not be alive to groan.

18:09.655 --> 18:10.655
Get out!

18:32.678 --> 18:34.179
Burt...

18:38.183 --> 18:39.684
Come in.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.686
I didn't know who else to call.

18:41.687 --> 18:43.688
Well, what happened?

18:43.689 --> 18:45.691
You said "any time."

18:47.192 --> 18:48.192
That's right.

18:48.193 --> 18:51.696
Any time, anywhere, any place...

18:51.697 --> 18:54.198
Well, I know it's late,
but here I am anyhow.

18:54.199 --> 18:56.701
Burt, What happened?

18:56.702 --> 18:59.203
Nothing much.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.206
I went home and found Mary
and her professor...

19:03.208 --> 19:04.208
Mary and her pro...

19:05.210 --> 19:08.713
I found Mary
and her professor...

19:11.216 --> 19:12.216
Oh, no.

19:12.217 --> 19:15.219
Yeah. I didn't know
what to do.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.721
I didn't know
whether to burst in or what.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.723
I felt like bursting in.

19:18.724 --> 19:19.724
I was so angry,

19:19.725 --> 19:21.726
but I didn't know what to do
once I burst in.

19:21.727 --> 19:25.730
I mean, I wasn't gonna kill him,
so why burst in?

19:25.731 --> 19:27.231
What was I gonna do?

19:27.232 --> 19:28.733
Burst in,
put out some Taco chips,

19:28.734 --> 19:29.735
and talk about it?

19:33.238 --> 19:35.239
So I just went into a bar,

19:35.240 --> 19:37.742
and I had a drink...
or 17.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.745
It's okay, though,

19:40.746 --> 19:43.248
because I hold my liquor
very well.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.252
Hey!

19:48.253 --> 19:52.256
Hey, maybe it was the professor
and some other woman.

19:52.257 --> 19:53.758
Maybe Mary loaned them
the couch.

19:56.762 --> 19:57.763
There.

20:09.274 --> 20:11.776
That wasn't
very strong, though, Sal.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.778
That was ginger ale, Burt.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.280
I think you've had enough.

20:16.281 --> 20:18.783
Hey, you know what?

20:20.285 --> 20:22.286
It was probably the upholsterer.

20:22.287 --> 20:25.289
Mary wanted new slipcovers
for the couch,

20:25.290 --> 20:27.792
and he was getting a look at it.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.795
An upholsterer who looked
like the professor,

20:30.796 --> 20:34.298
getting a good look
at the couch...

20:34.299 --> 20:36.801
on top of Mary.

20:36.802 --> 20:38.804
I'm gonna kill him!
I'm gonna break...

20:42.808 --> 20:44.809
Crazy place for a table.

20:44.810 --> 20:48.313
Who put the table in here?

21:08.834 --> 21:12.336
Burt, you're not going home.

21:12.337 --> 21:14.338
You're too drunk,
and you're too upset.

21:14.339 --> 21:15.840
What's he do?

21:15.841 --> 21:18.342
What's he do,
recite poetry to her?

21:18.343 --> 21:20.344
Is that the big attraction?

21:20.345 --> 21:22.346
Is that what does it,
a little poetry?

21:22.347 --> 21:25.850
A guy comes along,
tells you your eyes are pools...

21:25.851 --> 21:27.852
off comes the pantyhose?

21:27.853 --> 21:29.854
Is that what I have
to go through life

21:29.855 --> 21:31.355
worried about?

21:31.356 --> 21:34.358
Guys who rhyme their way
into my marriage?

21:34.359 --> 21:36.861
I can't believe
she did that to you.

21:36.862 --> 21:37.862
I mean, I just can't believe it.

21:37.863 --> 21:40.364
Well, if you can't believe it,

21:40.365 --> 21:42.867
can you imagine the trouble
I'm having here?

21:44.369 --> 21:47.371
How could she ever do that
to you?

21:47.372 --> 21:48.372
If I was married to you,

21:48.373 --> 21:51.375
I'd never even look
at another man.

21:51.376 --> 21:52.376
You wouldn't?

21:52.377 --> 21:54.879
Oh, are you kidding?

21:54.880 --> 21:58.883
Doesn't she know
how lucky she is?

21:58.884 --> 21:59.884
She should thank God
she has you.

21:59.885 --> 22:02.888
Instead, she's off...
God! That makes me sick.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.891
How could she do that to you?

22:06.892 --> 22:08.392
And in your own house, no less.

22:08.393 --> 22:09.894
And on our couch.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.395
On your couch.

22:11.396 --> 22:13.397
I picked that couch out.

22:13.398 --> 22:14.398
You didn't.

22:14.399 --> 22:18.402
The color,
I picked out the color.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.905
It's a good color.
It goes with everything.

22:20.906 --> 22:23.408
Oh, it's going with everything
now.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.411
Oh, Mary...

22:27.412 --> 22:30.414
I never thought
she would do that.

22:30.415 --> 22:32.917
I mean, how could she do
what she's doing?

22:32.918 --> 22:34.418
And now what am I gonna do

22:34.419 --> 22:35.920
now that she's done
what she did?

22:35.921 --> 22:38.923
Oh, God.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.925
It's who I married...

22:40.926 --> 22:42.928
I wanna die.

22:45.931 --> 22:47.933
Burt, you can't leave.

22:49.434 --> 22:50.935
I could,
if I could find the door.

22:52.437 --> 22:56.440
You're in absolutely
no condition to go anywhere.

22:56.441 --> 22:57.942
You're sleeping here tonight.

22:57.943 --> 22:59.443
Where?

22:59.444 --> 23:01.445
On the couch.

23:01.446 --> 23:05.449
Oh, well,
as long as it's on the couch.

23:05.450 --> 23:06.451
With me.

23:20.966 --> 23:23.467
<i>Will Eunice be happy</i>
<i>living on a farm with Dutch?</i>

23:23.468 --> 23:25.970
<i>Will Jodie be happy with Carol?</i>

23:25.971 --> 23:27.471
<i>Or will he be unhappy</i>
<i>without Dennis?</i>

23:27.472 --> 23:28.973
<i>How happy will Tim be</i>

23:28.974 --> 23:31.475
<i>when he finds out</i>
<i>Corinne is pregnant?</i>

23:31.476 --> 23:32.977
<i>Will Burt make Sally happy?</i>

23:32.978 --> 23:35.980
<i>And if he does,</i>
<i>how happy will that make Burt?</i>

23:35.981 --> 23:37.481
<i>Will Mary be happy</i>

23:37.482 --> 23:39.483
<i>studying English</i>
<i>in the professor's class...</i>

23:39.484 --> 23:41.485
<i>or should</i>
<i>she take karate instead?</i>

23:41.486 --> 23:43.487
<i>For the sake</i>
<i>of everyone's happiness,</i>

23:43.488 --> 23:45.489
<i>should Jessica put Chester away?</i>

23:45.490 --> 23:46.991
<i>Or should she let him</i>
<i>go through life</i>

23:46.992 --> 23:48.993
<i>as a happy-go-lucky idiot?</i>

23:48.994 --> 23:50.494
<i>These questions and many others</i>

23:50.495 --> 23:52.495
<i>will be answered on next week's</i>
<i>episode of...</i> Soap.

23:59.504 --> 24:02.006
