00:02.669 --> 00:04.737
(man panting, grunting)

00:09.776 --> 00:12.244
(heavy door creaks open)

00:14.180 --> 00:16.382
(man panting)

00:19.552 --> 00:20.652
(grunting)

00:30.397 --> 00:33.399
Stop! No!

00:33.401 --> 00:34.700
(panting)

00:34.702 --> 00:36.568
(grunting wildly)

00:38.171 --> 00:40.239
(screaming)

00:43.276 --> 00:44.777
You're delicious.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.445
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.147
Hang on a second.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.182
Now you're saying
your attacker looked like me?

00:50.184 --> 00:51.750
But ten minutes ago,
you said,

00:51.752 --> 00:53.519
"I couldn't see him
'cause I was blindfolded."

00:53.521 --> 00:56.321
That is technically right,
but by the sound of his voice,

00:56.323 --> 00:59.158
I could... I could
totally picture him.

00:59.160 --> 01:02.494
Sanders: So this
"shadowy figure," who looks

01:02.496 --> 01:04.263
Just like my colleague here,

01:04.265 --> 01:06.098
Grabs you off the street...
Blindfolds you.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.099
...Blindfolds you,

01:07.101 --> 01:09.068
Drives you to a dark room,

01:09.070 --> 01:10.469
Reeking of brimstone,

01:10.471 --> 01:13.105
Cuts off a hunk of your leg,
and then...

01:13.107 --> 01:14.673
And he eats it!

01:14.675 --> 01:16.208
Right in front of me!

01:19.746 --> 01:21.280
Only...

01:22.315 --> 01:23.315
What?

01:23.317 --> 01:26.618
Now that I think about it...

01:26.620 --> 01:28.287
He sounded more like you.

01:29.389 --> 01:32.257
(distorted):
Absolutely delectable.

01:34.661 --> 01:37.129
Okay, owen.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.464
Thanks for sharing your story.

01:38.466 --> 01:42.367
I'm telling you,
this city is writhing

01:42.369 --> 01:46.238
Hardly go to the grocery store
anymore without some

01:46.240 --> 01:49.108
Dahmer-looking bag boy
salivating over me.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.110
(cell phone chimes)
well, it's a good thing

01:51.112 --> 01:53.112
That you escaped this
particular psychopath.

01:56.149 --> 01:58.150
You know what?
Owen, it's been fun,

01:58.152 --> 01:59.351
But that's the morgue calling.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.619
We got to go.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.689
We'll start a file
and we'll keep an eye out.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.691
Make sure you go see a doctor.

02:05.693 --> 02:06.758
Yeah, have him
check your head.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.127
Uh, excuse me?

02:08.129 --> 02:09.628
Make sure
you get in bed.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.363
Right. Okay.
Yeah...

02:16.669 --> 02:19.471
Hey, man, sorry.
I heard you were looking for me.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.741
I had some lunatic at pd
talking about a people-eater.

02:22.743 --> 02:26.178
I heard about it,
and that's why I asked for you.

02:26.180 --> 02:29.314
That story might not
be so loony.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.484
A worker just
called this in.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.253
Found it at
the garbage dump.

02:34.255 --> 02:38.323
These, uh, rectangular
wounds exhibit a serration

02:38.325 --> 02:40.225
Of a steak knife.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.161
What are those particles
around the wound?

02:42.163 --> 02:44.530
Seasoning of
salt and sage.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.166
Per hodges's microscope,
not my taste buds.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.167
I get it.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.268
This is a prank, right?

02:49.270 --> 02:50.369
This is real.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.638
A-a crude
dismemberment like this

02:52.640 --> 02:55.807
Leaves me little doubt
that this meat is murder.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.644
World-class restaurants,
endless buffets--

02:58.646 --> 03:01.346
All those tasty
choices,

03:01.348 --> 03:05.517
And we've got a cannibal
in las vegas.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.260
♪ who... Are you?

03:15.262 --> 03:18.230
♪ who, who, who, who?

03:18.232 --> 03:21.533
♪ who... Are you?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.535
♪ who, who, who, who?

03:23.537 --> 03:24.937
♪ I really wanna know

03:24.939 --> 03:27.739
♪ who... Are you?

03:27.741 --> 03:29.908

♪ <i>who...</i> ♪

03:29.910 --> 03:33.312
♪ come on, tell me who are you,
you, you ♪

03:33.314 --> 03:35.314
♪ are you!

03:48.228 --> 03:50.862
Nick pulled prints
from the hand,

03:50.864 --> 03:53.599
Then he went up to the lab
to run them.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.300
Looky there.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.436
Second instar maggots...

03:59.372 --> 04:01.573
...On our cannibal's leftovers.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.308
What do you think?

04:03.310 --> 04:04.643
Two, three days into decomp?

04:04.645 --> 04:09.314
Two marks on the bone
indicate a serrated knife

04:09.316 --> 04:12.718
Cut through muscle and tendons,
allowing disarticulation.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.320
No medical expertise necessary.

04:15.322 --> 04:16.588
Well, it's really
no different than

04:16.590 --> 04:18.523
Pulling a drumstick
off a raw chicken.

04:18.525 --> 04:20.759
A little different, doc.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.996
Nick gave me some photos
of the other guy.

04:23.998 --> 04:25.764
Owen linder, right?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.633
The dinner who got away.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.835
Look at this--
the wound on mr. Linder's leg

04:29.837 --> 04:33.839
Exhibits the same distinct
blade flaw as these wounds.

04:36.409 --> 04:39.478
So, same knife,
same assailant maybe.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.013
But I heard
owen's story won't help much.

04:41.015 --> 04:42.781
He didn't see his attacker.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.683
He claims that he was
abducted off the street,

04:44.685 --> 04:47.886
<i>Blindfolded,</i>
<i>then driven to some room.</i>

04:47.888 --> 04:49.621
(grunting, yelling)

04:49.623 --> 04:52.691
<i>The pain of his leg</i>
<i>being filleted</i>

04:52.693 --> 04:55.294
<i>Made him break free</i>
<i>and run blindly into the night.</i>

04:58.364 --> 05:00.699
So, no idea where he ran from?

05:00.701 --> 05:02.668
Mm-mm. By the time
the cops showed up,

05:02.670 --> 05:04.303
He was completely turned around.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.370
Okay, boys.

05:05.372 --> 05:08.407
The, uh, print
on the hand says

05:08.409 --> 05:10.809
The arm belongs to a local:
Dennis hagel.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.611
Former endoscopic surgery tech.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.346
Got fired for
stealing meds.
Hmm.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.782
So, patrol's out there right now
looking for the rest of him.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.851
I hope they find him alive
and otherwise intact.

05:21.821 --> 05:25.557
You are a deeply
bizarre man.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.793
Oh, yeah? Well, you're no
walk in the park, you know.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.328
Not you.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.530
I was talking about owen linder.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.598
I've been doing some
digging on this guy.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.866
There's more to his story?

05:34.868 --> 05:36.735
A twisted prologue.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.037
Owen has been spending
some serious time

05:39.039 --> 05:41.540
In a very dark corner
of the internet.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.009
"vore."

05:44.011 --> 05:45.811
Sanders:
Short for vorarephilia--

05:45.813 --> 05:47.846
An erotic, compulsive fixation

05:47.848 --> 05:49.481
That involves eating

05:49.483 --> 05:52.384
Or being eaten by
other living things.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.619
Cannibalism.

05:54.621 --> 05:57.556
Well, that's just one room
in the vore fetish madhouse.

05:57.558 --> 06:01.460
Others involve man-eating plants
and giant hungry cats

06:01.462 --> 06:03.528
And a whole pornucopia of things

06:03.530 --> 06:04.896
You don't even want
to know about.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.531
You're right there.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.100
But owen here

06:08.102 --> 06:09.901
Is into plain old cannibalism.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.636
At least the idea of it.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.572
I mean, he is all
over these sites.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.408
Doing what?

06:16.410 --> 06:18.710
Doing what other
vore enthusiasts do:

06:18.712 --> 06:20.779
Talking about his desire
to be devoured.

06:20.781 --> 06:25.150
Of having his flesh
chewed up and swallowed.

06:25.152 --> 06:29.688
Yeah, but his fantasy became
a... A bloody reality.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.958
So, what do you think,
that he asked for what happened?

06:32.960 --> 06:37.129
That he offered himself up
to a... A real-life cannibal?

06:37.131 --> 06:40.966
I think that owen and I
need to chew the fat.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.742
Did I forget to mention
this part of the story?

06:50.744 --> 06:53.812
I could tell you guys barely
believed me about the attack,

06:53.814 --> 06:55.847
Much less if it looked
like I asked for it.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.849
So you didn't ask for it?

06:57.851 --> 07:00.118
For a guy to help himself
to a hunk of my leg?

07:00.120 --> 07:01.486
Are you nuts?!

07:01.488 --> 07:02.821
It was supposed to be
role-playing.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.689
I thought I made that
very clear to him.

07:04.691 --> 07:05.991
Clear to who?

07:05.993 --> 07:07.692
Your attacker?

07:07.694 --> 07:09.928
Yeah.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.596
Who was he?
I don't know.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.433
Guy responded privately
to one of my web posts.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.835
Said he was a "pred"
looking for "prey."

07:16.837 --> 07:18.503
Went by the name "eater."

07:18.505 --> 07:19.805
Wanted to meet up.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.674
So you made a... Date?

07:22.676 --> 07:24.910
Yeah. "eater" told me, uh, to
wait in front of my house,

07:24.912 --> 07:26.545
And he sneaks up.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.046
(snaps fingers)
blindfold.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.515
Puts me in the car,
takes me to his place.

07:30.517 --> 07:32.083
You went willingly?

07:32.085 --> 07:33.452
Oh, yeah.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.020
Yeah, but I figured,
you know, we'd...

07:35.022 --> 07:37.956
We'd get out the condiments,
you know, slather up and...

07:37.958 --> 07:38.990
All right. All right.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.892
All right. That's enough.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.227
Right.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.929
So, after he cut you up...

07:43.931 --> 07:46.198
...Everything else
you told us...

07:46.200 --> 07:48.834
My daring escape
and flee to freedom--

07:48.836 --> 07:50.469
All true.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.638
I swear.
All right.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.106
We're gonna need to see

07:55.108 --> 07:57.476
All your online correspondence
with this "eater."

07:57.478 --> 07:58.643
All right, sure,

07:58.645 --> 08:00.145
But it won't help you track him.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.547
"eater" was strictly anonymous.

08:02.549 --> 08:05.717
No way he's leaving
any digital breadcrumbs behind.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.652
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.954
Well, he did leave us this.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.056
Part of a meal.

08:11.058 --> 08:14.159
Named... Dennis hagel.
You know him?

08:14.161 --> 08:17.496
Maybe he frequented
the same vore sites.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.065
Maybe he shared
the same interests.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.067
Vegas local.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.169
He worked in endoscopic surgery.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.705
Oh.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.874
Like when they stick a camera
down your throat?

08:28.876 --> 08:30.008
Into your belly?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.743
Yeah.

08:34.113 --> 08:36.681
What is it, owen?

08:39.552 --> 08:42.020
There's something
you need to see.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.957
Sidle: Greg just
sent over this video.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.859
Owen linder claims
it's a snuff film that's been

08:47.861 --> 08:49.928
Making its way around
the online vore community--

08:49.930 --> 08:52.831
A snuff film like
no one's ever seen before.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.900
According to owen,

08:54.902 --> 08:56.902
This lady's name
is "miss feed."

08:56.904 --> 08:59.804
Hi, out there.

08:59.806 --> 09:03.241
It's another...
Sunny day in vegas.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.076
Want to have some fun?

09:05.078 --> 09:06.645
Webcam stripper.

09:06.647 --> 09:10.949
She offers a unique service
to vore-heads like owen

09:10.951 --> 09:12.684
That dream of being gobbled up.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.719
You look so yummy.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.756
Mmm. And I'm just so hungry.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.257
I can't wait...

09:20.826 --> 09:22.894
...To devour you.

09:24.797 --> 09:25.797
(gagging)

09:25.799 --> 09:27.599
This is new.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.004
Endoscopic camera.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.105
Possibly manned by

09:34.107 --> 09:35.941
Our disarmed victim,
dennis hagel.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.243
Can't be too many people
with that skill-set

09:38.245 --> 09:39.978
Involved with
this kind of stuff.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.046
Yeah.

09:44.116 --> 09:45.784
And we've reached her stomach.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.786
Lovely.

09:47.788 --> 09:48.787
(squishing)

09:48.789 --> 09:51.590
Whoa. What was that?

09:51.592 --> 09:54.693
Oh, my god.
It's a knife.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.161
She's getting stabbed.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.630
Let it play.

09:59.865 --> 10:01.866
(sloshing)

10:01.868 --> 10:04.369
All that blood--
an artery was hit.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.104
She's dying.

10:08.741 --> 10:11.743
Uh, wh-what does
the video's metadata say?

10:12.979 --> 10:14.913
Originated
three days ago,

10:14.915 --> 10:17.816
But it bounced through proxies,
obscuring any other information.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.819
So, we have a murder victim
with no name

10:20.821 --> 10:22.320
And no idea where
the crime scene is.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.023
Video's all we got to work with.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.993
Well, if we can stand
a closer look,

10:27.995 --> 10:30.061
There might be something in here
that can help us.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.897
Let's split it up.
Go frame by frame.

10:32.899 --> 10:35.066
Listen, stephanie, why
don't we reschedule.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.036
I'm completely jammed up
in traffic on the strip.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.270
Okay. Bye.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.740
Who you hiding from?

10:41.742 --> 10:44.042
Head of my share-free
election committee.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.978
A smart woman,
tons of energy, but...

10:46.980 --> 10:48.313
You can't stand her.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.081
Well, you're welcome
to take refuge

10:50.083 --> 10:51.182
In here if you want.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.151
I mean...

10:53.153 --> 10:55.353
Election's over a year away.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.922
They're already pressuring me
about my image, my platform,

10:57.924 --> 10:59.924
Soliciting contributions.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.927
Getting appointed, I avoided
that whole campaign circus.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.796
Well, no one's gonna run
against you this time.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.931
So, your job
should be safe, right?

11:06.933 --> 11:08.133
Well, that's
the other thing.

11:09.268 --> 11:12.303
I don't know if I want it.

11:13.806 --> 11:15.006
Really?

11:15.008 --> 11:18.009
Sometimes I miss the lab.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.046
The way you get to work
here, it's clean, honest.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.714
You don't have to
get your hands dirty.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.183
Well, for a vegas sheriff,
your hands are pretty clean.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.018
Unless you've started

11:27.020 --> 11:29.821
Planting bodies in the desert
like the good old days.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.856
Not yet, but I can certainly
understand the impulse.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.125
Some of the decisions I've
had to make in this job,

11:34.127 --> 11:36.094
Some of the ugliness
in this town.

11:36.096 --> 11:39.330
We've had a big helping
of that today.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.733
Yeah.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.968
A killer with a taste
for human flesh,

11:43.970 --> 11:46.404
Preying on those
who fantasize about it.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.405
That's the headline.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.873
Well, we better
solve it

11:48.875 --> 11:50.208
Before it hits the news.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.811
Came by to see
what you got.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.180
Got a crazy story from one vic,

11:55.182 --> 11:56.781
An arm

11:56.783 --> 11:58.116
From another

11:58.118 --> 12:00.051
And a snuff film from the third.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.454
That's it?
No other physical evidence?

12:02.456 --> 12:04.055
No.

12:04.057 --> 12:08.059
And no reason to think
that this maniac is gonna stop.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.061
(sighs)

12:10.063 --> 12:12.430
You want to have some fun?

12:13.365 --> 12:16.201
♪

12:38.824 --> 12:40.458
♪

13:07.220 --> 13:10.255
So, it turns out,
trying to solve a murder

13:10.257 --> 13:13.291
From inside the victim
is a hell of a lot trickier

13:13.293 --> 13:15.293
Than it sounds.
The best luck I've had

13:15.295 --> 13:16.895
Is with the murder weapon.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.863
The knife is serrated.

13:18.865 --> 13:22.066
Same kind of knife that cut
our other two victims.

13:22.068 --> 13:25.136
And I noticed an unusual detail
in that freeze-frame.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.372
Engraved symbol.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.574
The cyrillic name
of a russian village.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.276
"marilsk."

13:31.278 --> 13:33.077
So, either the killer
is from there

13:33.079 --> 13:34.145
Or just a collector.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.413
Either way,

13:35.415 --> 13:38.483
We still have no idea
who or where "miss feed" is.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.052
Actually, we do.
As luck should have it,

13:41.054 --> 13:42.554
Her strange eating habits
weren't just limited

13:42.556 --> 13:44.222
To her work.
I noticed this

13:44.224 --> 13:46.291
In my analysis of
the stomach video.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.894
Jelly donut wrapped
around hamburger.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.197
There's only one place in town
that serves that sandwich.

13:52.199 --> 13:55.466
Hangover grill--
and I'm never going there again.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.601
I got the credit card receipts

13:56.603 --> 13:58.069
From the day
"miss feed" was killed,

13:58.071 --> 13:59.504
And I ran them
through dmv.

14:01.373 --> 14:04.309
"miss feed" is actually
miss brenda waring.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.344
Her home address
is in henderson.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.548
Lvpd!

14:35.374 --> 14:36.241
Brody:

14:36.243 --> 14:38.076
Cameraman.

14:41.614 --> 14:42.914
We got it.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.249
Why don't you
get some air.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.516
Thank you.

14:51.257 --> 14:54.092
Brenda waring wasn't
just killed, she was butchered.

15:00.666 --> 15:03.368
Salt and sage.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.436

Causing this picture

16:01.094 --> 16:02.660
Brenda was meticulous,
very organized.

I don't think
she would've let it

left the door unlocked.

16:26.052 --> 16:28.419
Nice neighborhood,
middle of the day-- why not?

16:28.421 --> 16:30.488
All the darkness,
all the weirdness

16:30.490 --> 16:33.992
Was kept in this corner
of her world.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.260

16:45.237 --> 16:47.605

16:53.046 --> 16:55.079
<i>He was taken out quickly.</i>

16:55.081 --> 16:58.049
The target of the killer's rage
appears to have been brenda.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.218
Dozen stab wounds centered
around her stomach.

17:00.220 --> 17:03.488
That's quite a statement,
considering her line of work.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.256
Assailant had to know her
as "miss feed."

17:05.258 --> 17:07.625
Maybe an obsessed
or jilted client.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.761
After consuming brenda,

17:09.763 --> 17:13.064
The psycho didn't seem
to have an appetite for dennis.

17:15.100 --> 17:17.368
Apparently, uh,

17:17.370 --> 17:18.669
He bagged dennis's arm to go.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.171
It might not have been
all he took.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.473
I haven't been able to find

17:22.475 --> 17:25.109
A purse anywhere around here.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.045
No wallet.

17:27.047 --> 17:30.148
A cannibal, a killer...

17:30.150 --> 17:31.749
And a thief?

17:32.584 --> 17:34.452
Hodges: In some
cannibalistic cultures,

17:34.454 --> 17:37.221
It was believed that
eating someone's flesh

17:37.223 --> 17:39.757
Was a way to absorb
their strength,

17:39.759 --> 17:43.327
Their, uh, spiritual
essence, their wisdom,

17:43.329 --> 17:44.395
Their skills.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.798
You've studied this?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.566
Caribbean cruise
when I was 11.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.535
I was prepared
for any encounters.

17:50.537 --> 17:54.205
So, I was thinking,
"miss feed"

17:54.207 --> 17:56.374
Feasted on all of those clients.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.310
So, maybe the killer
was after her,

17:59.312 --> 18:02.080
Fed on her
because he saw her

18:02.082 --> 18:04.615
As a sort of
human turducken.

18:04.617 --> 18:08.586
All those spirits
inside of her...

18:08.588 --> 18:11.823
Would make for a
very powerful meal.

18:11.825 --> 18:14.592
But "miss feed"
only dealt in simulation.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.228
She never actually
ingested any flesh.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.497
This killer
is brunching on people.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.299
His logic might be
slightly out of whack.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.300
(cell phone vibrates)

18:22.302 --> 18:24.635
He's also out of cash.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.672
Just got a hit that someone used
brenda waring's credit card.

18:30.509 --> 18:33.311
Charging up
your sister's plastic?

18:33.313 --> 18:35.713
That's a strange way of grieving
your sister's death, colleen.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.487
Yeah, I stole from brenda.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.455
But that was
five days ago.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.656
I didn't hurt her.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.258
I was in jail
until this morning

18:47.260 --> 18:49.293
When I used her card.

18:49.295 --> 18:52.130
We know that you didn't
kill your sister, colleen.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.198
You were locked up
at the time of the murder.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.600
Meth possession.

18:55.602 --> 18:59.437
But maybe you know
who did this to brenda.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.540
(crying):
I told her they would hurt her.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.676
Kind of guys who'd ask her
to do those things.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.578
She's tempting them.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.180
And the demons
wouldn't stay boxed

19:09.182 --> 19:11.349
Inside the computer forever.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.684
I tried to warn her.

19:13.686 --> 19:17.321
All the wicked people out there.

19:20.559 --> 19:23.427
So, these, uh,
demons you mentioned--

19:23.429 --> 19:26.631
The clients that
your sister performed for--

19:26.633 --> 19:30.768
Did she ever tell you
about any of them?

19:32.538 --> 19:35.206
Problems she may have had
with them?

19:35.208 --> 19:37.742
Last time I saw her
was five days ago.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.944
And something...

19:39.946 --> 19:42.914
Somebody had scared her.

19:42.916 --> 19:45.650
Brenda, if one of those online
pervs said something to you,

19:45.652 --> 19:46.717
Threatened you...

19:46.719 --> 19:48.486
It wasn't one of my clients.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.754
It's fine.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.556
I don't know why you even
deal with these freaks!

19:51.558 --> 19:53.758
These urges
that some of them have--

19:53.760 --> 19:55.326
If I can't help them,

19:55.328 --> 19:56.694
They could end up
hurting themselves.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.597
You can understand
that, right?

19:59.599 --> 20:02.200
And if you came here for
money to use, forget it.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.534
(door slams)

20:03.536 --> 20:05.870
Colleen: <i>She wouldn't give me</i>
<i>what I wanted,</i>

20:05.872 --> 20:07.905
<i>So I took it.</i>

20:07.907 --> 20:11.642
I scavenged what I
could get from her.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.710
(sobs softly)

20:12.712 --> 20:14.845
And now she's gone.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.517
Okay, this is
totally none of my business,

20:19.519 --> 20:21.586
But did I hear that

20:21.588 --> 20:22.620
You asked nick out?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.722
No, I did not ask nick out.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.524
But we do have
a work date.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.992
We're going
to this party.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.329
"the feast of the cannibals"?

20:31.331 --> 20:33.798
Yeah, I found
the invite

20:33.800 --> 20:36.300
In brenda waring's
recovered purse.

20:36.302 --> 20:39.737
"join us to indulge your palate
for the darkest of delicacies,

20:39.739 --> 20:42.707
Among the city's
most refined aficionados."

20:42.709 --> 20:44.542
This can't be real.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.777
The address is at a
foreclosed-on mansion

20:46.779 --> 20:48.446
In seven hills,

20:48.448 --> 20:49.647
So it's gonna be a party
of trespassers.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.616
But I think it's a
good chance to talk

20:51.618 --> 20:54.518
See if they know anything
about the murders

20:54.520 --> 20:56.787
At "miss feed's"
and the elusive "eater."

20:56.789 --> 20:58.723
Fetish is
a small community.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.758
There's got to be somebody at
the party who knows something.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.395
Yeah, maybe even our killer
cannibal himself will be there.

21:04.397 --> 21:07.431
Mm-hmm. Well, don't wear
anything too appetizing.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.517
C-note's a c-note.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.885
Yeah, it is.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.020
And that should just about cover
your trespassing ticket.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.925
I assure you, the feast
is a perfectly benign

23:47.927 --> 23:51.495
Role-playing fantasy
among consenting adults.

23:51.497 --> 23:54.598
Predators and prey,
all pretend.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.767
Well, there's someone out there
who shares your appetites,

23:56.769 --> 23:59.003
But who is definitely
not pretending.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.005
Do tell.

24:01.007 --> 24:05.042
Nothing gets gobbled up faster
around here than gossip.

24:09.915 --> 24:11.949
That's an interesting
cuff link, mr. Korlov.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.684
It's an heirloom.

24:13.686 --> 24:16.153
It's the crest of my
ancestors' village.

24:16.155 --> 24:20.024
It's a bloody family
saga worthy of tolstoy.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.660
I could talk your
lovely ear off with it.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.962
Think I'll keep my ear.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.698
Is there someplace more private
where we could speak?

24:32.237 --> 24:34.638
Brenda.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.608
So you knew her--
not just as "miss feed."

24:37.610 --> 24:40.110
She and her cameraman,
dennis hagel,

24:40.112 --> 24:42.146
Were murdered.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.514
Butchered.

24:43.516 --> 24:45.249
Parts of them were eaten.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.484
For real.

24:46.486 --> 24:49.720
And the knife...

24:49.722 --> 24:52.056
That was used
in the slaughter

24:52.058 --> 24:55.759
Has the same symbol
as on your cufflinks, gary.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.803
I know what it is to live
in the jaws of a compulsion--

25:05.805 --> 25:08.205
To have one
sinister impulse

25:08.207 --> 25:11.542
Ticking, relentless,
through your every fiber.

25:11.544 --> 25:15.112
But my impulse is not
to feed on flesh.

25:20.218 --> 25:21.919
Mr. Korlov...

25:23.955 --> 25:25.823
Rather, to be fed upon.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.928
"miss feed..."

25:30.930 --> 25:32.229
Brenda... Was an angel.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.731
She was helping me

25:33.733 --> 25:36.267
To heal from this.

25:36.269 --> 25:38.102
What happened to you?

25:40.272 --> 25:44.208
Korlov: <i>I met this</i>
<i>pitch-black soul online,</i>

25:44.210 --> 25:46.577
<i>A man named "eater."</i>

25:46.579 --> 25:48.846
<i>I brought him offerings--</i>

25:48.848 --> 25:52.816
<i>Pieces of my flesh,</i>
<i>surgically removed.</i>

25:52.818 --> 25:55.920
<i>"eater" would dine</i>
<i>on my offerings.</i>

25:57.255 --> 26:01.592
The arrangement was
mutually satisfying.

26:01.594 --> 26:05.629
I gave him that antique knife
as a gift,

26:05.631 --> 26:07.698
To use during our dinners.

26:10.035 --> 26:11.335
<i>It was bliss.</i>

26:11.337 --> 26:14.138
<i>I knew it would destroy me,</i>

26:14.140 --> 26:16.240
<i>Piece by piece,</i>

26:16.242 --> 26:18.309
So I sought out brenda.

26:20.045 --> 26:23.113
Seeking salvation
through her services.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.848
So you were one of her clients

26:24.850 --> 26:26.216
That she would
virtually consume.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.918
Yes.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.889
And I-I told "eater"
I'd found a healthier way

26:31.891 --> 26:34.658
To... Quench my impulses.

26:34.660 --> 26:35.793
And how did he take that?

26:35.795 --> 26:39.263
Having food ripped
from his mouth?

26:39.265 --> 26:41.131
Evidently, not well.

26:43.068 --> 26:45.603
You were face-to-face
with "eater."

26:45.605 --> 26:47.805
Did you get a good look at him?

26:49.641 --> 26:53.277
Korlov: <i>Yes. I looked</i>
<i>right into his eyes.</i>

26:55.180 --> 26:56.814
Sidle:
If you believe him,

26:56.816 --> 26:58.616
Gary korlov said
that he was blindfolded

26:58.618 --> 27:01.051
On trips to and from
"eater's" place,

27:01.053 --> 27:03.887
But he was permitted to watch
"eater" dine on his flesh.

27:03.889 --> 27:05.189
That's only fair,
I guess.

27:05.191 --> 27:08.892
Korlov cooperated
on a police sketch of "eater."

27:08.894 --> 27:12.196
So, we still don't know where
this guy's "dining room" is?

27:12.198 --> 27:13.797
That's what we're
working on now,

27:13.799 --> 27:15.866
Starting with the fact
that owen linder--

27:15.868 --> 27:18.268
Our escaped victim--
ended up here...

27:19.804 --> 27:21.038
...And he couldn't run too far

27:21.040 --> 27:22.206
From "eater's" lair.

27:22.208 --> 27:25.075
Let's call it a one-mile radius.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.343
Korlov recalled
certain details of his visits.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.078
He said it felt like
an industrial space,

27:28.080 --> 27:30.214
And he said on one visit,
he heard a train

27:30.216 --> 27:32.683
<i>That was close enough</i>
<i>to disturb the dinner.</i>

27:32.685 --> 27:35.119
Rails cut through the north end
of that search radius.

27:35.121 --> 27:38.288
Well, let's lose
the south half.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.823
Mm.

27:39.825 --> 27:42.192
It is still
way too much ground to cover.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.293
Factories,
warehouses.

27:43.295 --> 27:46.263
Russell:
Mm.

27:47.966 --> 27:50.034
Sanders:
You know,

27:50.036 --> 27:52.236
Linder had said something
in his first interview--

27:52.238 --> 27:55.172
We thought he was just a
nut job with a crazy story--

27:55.174 --> 27:59.209
But he said he smelled...
Brimstone while being attacked.

27:59.211 --> 28:01.278
Brimstone? Sulfur.

28:02.781 --> 28:06.784
Sanders: This company here
produces organic pesticides.

28:06.786 --> 28:09.119
Sulfur is a major
component of those.

28:11.289 --> 28:12.923
Russell:
Well, the company may have

28:12.925 --> 28:15.059
Gone out of business
a couple years ago,

28:15.061 --> 28:17.327
But the odor of sulfur
would have lingered.

28:17.329 --> 28:20.364
May not be the only thing
hanging around there.

28:23.068 --> 28:26.136
(heavy door creaks open)

28:37.115 --> 28:38.949
Padlock on the door

28:38.951 --> 28:40.250
And not a soul around.

28:42.353 --> 28:44.021
Perfect place
for "eater" to feed.

28:47.425 --> 28:49.193
Smells like bleach.

28:53.031 --> 28:55.466
Sanders:
He cleaned up.

29:09.214 --> 29:11.281
He knew we'd
be coming.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.083
He set the table for us.

29:13.085 --> 29:17.054
Sidle: Murder weapon,
napkin left like that--

29:17.056 --> 29:18.789
Does it mean he's done?

29:18.791 --> 29:21.992
Or just done
with the first course.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.795
Ecklie: <i>A dead end?</i>
<i>Greg and sara didn't find</i>

29:24.797 --> 29:26.864
Any prints, dna?

29:28.199 --> 29:29.266
All right.

29:29.268 --> 29:32.436
Uh... Keep me
looped in, d.B.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.271
Sorry, bill.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.006
Crime lab.

29:36.008 --> 29:38.108
When I was sheriff,
that department was three geeks

29:38.110 --> 29:40.110
With a microscope
I believe they ordered

29:40.112 --> 29:42.012
Off the back
of a comic book.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.313
(chuckles)
hard to think the lab

29:43.315 --> 29:45.315
Ever produced a man
fit for the tin star,

29:45.317 --> 29:46.784
But you've proven yourself.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.185
Well, I appreciate that.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.888
Now you're telling me
you want to pansy out,

29:50.890 --> 29:52.089
Retreat from your duty?

29:52.091 --> 29:55.192
I'm just not sure...
Whether to run again.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.261
That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.163
I've been doing some
thinking...
Eh, thinking is

29:59.165 --> 30:00.931
Crime lab stuff-- sheriff
doesn't have to think.

30:00.933 --> 30:03.200
Sheriff has a gut
tells him what to do.

30:07.238 --> 30:09.139
I hear you.

30:11.843 --> 30:15.145
Listen, conrad...

30:15.147 --> 30:17.414
I know the job's
rough as hell,

30:17.416 --> 30:19.950
Politics can be bloodier
than the crime scenes,

30:19.952 --> 30:22.419
And with the... The scrutiny
you're under nowadays,

30:22.421 --> 30:26.256
You don't even have
some of the... Release valves

30:26.258 --> 30:29.026
Sheriffs used
to be afforded.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.861
But here's the thing:

30:30.863 --> 30:34.298
You're the sheriff,
and you don't answer to anyone.

30:34.300 --> 30:38.836
Not your campaign staff
or the crime lab

30:38.838 --> 30:40.537
Or not even your own voice
in your own head

30:40.539 --> 30:42.072
When it starts doubting you.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.440
You're the sheriff,
and you make it

30:43.442 --> 30:45.843
So the people in this city
can sleep at night.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.444
That's it.

30:47.446 --> 30:50.113
And you're gonna
keep doing that.

30:52.317 --> 30:55.052
Thanks, bill.

30:55.054 --> 30:58.355
Now, what's this I hear
about a killer cannibal?

30:58.357 --> 31:00.324
Tell me you got
this creep in a cage.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.359
I wish I could.
All we've got now

31:02.361 --> 31:04.962
Is a sketch
of the suspect.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.430
Just released it
to the press.

31:06.432 --> 31:09.299
That face on the news--
every numbskull

31:09.301 --> 31:13.003
In the city is gonna be spinning
a stephen king story for you.

31:13.005 --> 31:16.440
You're supposed to be curing
nightmares, not causing them.

31:18.009 --> 31:19.610
Newsman: Police are asking
anyone with information

31:19.612 --> 31:22.079
On the suspect
to call their tip line.

31:22.081 --> 31:26.083
Sir, you-you believe
you saw the suspect?

31:26.085 --> 31:28.285
I'm sorry,
did you say "undead"?

31:28.287 --> 31:30.053
All this says something

31:30.055 --> 31:32.356
About our city's
collective imagination.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.591
Or maybe their
amphetamine use.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.293
Man: Listen to me!
I'm telling you,

31:36.295 --> 31:38.328
I got him! I caught
the cannibal!

31:38.330 --> 31:40.330
What's going on?
I swear to god,

31:40.332 --> 31:41.932
I got him cuffed up
in the car outside!

31:41.934 --> 31:43.000
Somebody help me!

31:43.002 --> 31:45.402
Send stokes out here.

31:45.404 --> 31:48.005
Come here.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.274
He's right over here.

31:51.209 --> 31:53.410
Uh... Right here.
Right here.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.345
He's right, uh...

31:55.347 --> 31:56.613
What?

31:56.615 --> 31:58.482
No... What...?

31:58.484 --> 32:00.150
Give me your light.

32:14.399 --> 32:17.167
Our cannibal ate his way out?

32:24.309 --> 32:26.376
♪

32:53.571 --> 32:55.105
The hell
were you thinking,

32:55.107 --> 32:59.109
I saw him, I just reacted.
It's my training.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.477
Your training?

33:00.479 --> 33:02.145
You're an office
security guard;

33:02.147 --> 33:04.014
You don't apprehend
serial killers.

33:04.016 --> 33:06.083
Well, apparently,
neither do you guys.

33:06.085 --> 33:08.018
Take a seat, todd.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.623
Let's just get
this all straight.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.659
So you saw this guy
outside your building...

33:15.661 --> 33:18.395
I was at my watch post;
and I'd seen

33:18.397 --> 33:20.163
The news, the sketch
of the suspect.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.532
And there he was.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.568
Same awful face
just passing by outside.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.636
So, I grabbed my taser,
I went out there...

33:26.638 --> 33:30.574
I tackled him and I cuffed him
in my car.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.175
Did he say anything
when you were driving here?

33:32.177 --> 33:35.479
No, he was silent.
He was just staring at me.

33:35.481 --> 33:38.415
Waiting for his chance.

33:43.554 --> 33:45.322
No hits on the prints

33:45.324 --> 33:48.592
Or dna from the hand, but
with an injury like that,

33:48.594 --> 33:51.061
I'm guessing, suspect's not
getting very far anyway.

33:51.063 --> 33:52.362
That would be true

33:52.364 --> 33:54.197
If this were the suspect's hand.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.700
What are you talking about?
Once the wound was cleaned,

33:56.702 --> 33:59.403
The tissue exhibited
significant deterioration.

33:59.405 --> 34:01.438
That hand was disembodied
at least 24 hours ago.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.440
Really?

34:03.442 --> 34:05.509
Phillips: And the tool marks
on the ligament indicate

34:05.511 --> 34:07.778
That a knife was used,
not teeth.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.315
The security guard is a liar.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.185
You know why
we're in here, todd?

34:15.187 --> 34:16.720
'cause the only real thing
about your story

34:16.722 --> 34:18.822
Is a severed human hand.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.824
Whose hand is it?
I don't know.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.359
Ecklie:
You killed somebody.

34:22.361 --> 34:24.127
You took their hand
to fake a story,

34:24.129 --> 34:25.629
To make yourself
look like a hero.

34:25.631 --> 34:28.665
No! I didn't
hurt anyone.

34:31.169 --> 34:32.636
He gave it to me.

34:32.638 --> 34:33.770
Who gave it to you?

34:33.772 --> 34:36.473
Him.

34:36.475 --> 34:39.509
Enough. Listen to me,
you twisted little...

34:39.511 --> 34:43.480
He approached me one night
when I was at work alone.

34:43.482 --> 34:47.551
I don't know why
he chose me, but he did.

34:47.553 --> 34:50.253
He knew the names of my
little niece and nephew.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.488
He had pictures.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.757
He said that if I
didn't do this for him,

34:53.759 --> 34:55.492
That he was gonna...

34:59.230 --> 35:02.399
He gave me the hand
and a bottle of blood,

35:02.401 --> 35:05.502
And he told me what he wanted it
to look like.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.479
I was just supposed
to drive here

35:15.481 --> 35:16.780
And say that I'd caught
the cannibal.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.181
Give it a rest.

35:18.183 --> 35:21.751
This is all a little bit
hard to believe.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.487
I'm a good person.

35:25.423 --> 35:27.824
I-I never would've thought

35:27.826 --> 35:30.627
That I'd cooperate with
a monster like that.

35:30.629 --> 35:34.431
And it wasn't even the threat--
my niece and nephew.

35:36.834 --> 35:38.835
There was something
about this guy.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.637
When he was near me,

35:40.639 --> 35:42.372
There was this...

35:42.374 --> 35:46.676
This power...
Buzzing off of him.

35:48.346 --> 35:51.581
He could get you to do
whatever he wanted.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.650
Like you were
face-to-face

35:53.652 --> 35:56.853
With the devil himself.

36:00.558 --> 36:02.359
(gasping)
todd? Todd!

36:02.361 --> 36:04.561
Hey, dad, this is for real.

36:04.563 --> 36:07.664
Todd? Okay, okay,
turn your head.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.699
He's seizing.
Keep your tongue...

36:09.701 --> 36:11.234
Ecklie:
Get medical!

36:21.846 --> 36:23.380
Any word?

36:23.382 --> 36:25.849
Todd burris is dead.
Cyanide poisoning.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.317
Hospital ran tox

36:27.319 --> 36:29.719
And gave us his possessions
and clothing.

36:29.721 --> 36:30.787
Maybe he dosed himself.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.923
Could've snuck a pill
into pd.

36:32.925 --> 36:35.258
Once his story started
unraveling,

36:35.260 --> 36:38.261
He knew he was gonna
get arrested, humiliated.

36:38.263 --> 36:39.729
Didn't want to face it.

36:39.731 --> 36:42.265
Or the matter of where exactly
he got that human hand.

36:44.902 --> 36:47.404
What if there's some truth
to todd's story?

36:47.406 --> 36:50.574
He spent his dying
words telling it.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.810
Okay, I suppose
last words deserve a chance.

36:53.812 --> 36:57.447
So, according to todd,
the cannibal forced him

36:57.449 --> 36:59.749
To stage the bloody scene
in the car.

36:59.751 --> 37:00.884
But why would he do that?

37:00.886 --> 37:03.220
I mean, just to mess
with the cops?

37:03.222 --> 37:07.357
Sidle: Maybe to fuel the fire
of his own myth.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.759
You know, the tale of
the killer cannibal who eats

37:09.761 --> 37:11.294
Through his own wrist to escape.

37:11.296 --> 37:13.797
That's boogeyman-level stuff.

37:13.799 --> 37:15.332
Lives on in urban legend.

37:15.334 --> 37:19.502
So, "eater" uses todd
to spread his tale,

37:19.504 --> 37:23.540
Then somehow
magically doses him

37:23.542 --> 37:25.575
With cyanide
to take him out.

37:25.577 --> 37:29.279
Or todd was just
another attention hound

37:29.281 --> 37:30.547
With a vivid imagination.

37:35.453 --> 37:38.255
He didn't imagine it.

37:38.257 --> 37:39.789
This watch belonged
to dennis hagel,

37:39.791 --> 37:40.824
Our slain cameraman.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.826
And this fabric...

37:42.828 --> 37:44.828
Ripped from brenda
waring's lingerie.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.363
Tokens from our victims.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.931
Why?

37:47.933 --> 37:51.601
Maybe "eater's" trying to send
a message that he's real.

37:53.004 --> 37:56.840
There is another
possibility

37:56.842 --> 37:58.842
How todd could have
these items

37:58.844 --> 38:00.944
And why he would use
his last dying words

38:00.946 --> 38:03.413
To spread the myth of "eater."

38:03.415 --> 38:05.849
There was this...

38:05.851 --> 38:08.952
Power buzzing off of him.

38:08.954 --> 38:12.289
Sanders: <i>To paint an image,</i>
<i>more than just a killer,</i>

38:12.291 --> 38:13.590
<i>But as something supernatural.</i>

38:13.592 --> 38:16.993
Like you were face-to-face
with the devil himself.

38:16.995 --> 38:20.330
What if the myth he was
spreading was his own?

38:20.332 --> 38:21.965
Todd burris was "eater."

38:23.467 --> 38:26.369
Did these horrific acts,
took tokens from his victims.

38:26.371 --> 38:29.639
All because he wanted
to create his own legend.

38:29.641 --> 38:33.009
To live on, not just as some
no-name rent-a-cop...

38:33.011 --> 38:36.546
But as the nightmare
that devoured and disappeared.

38:40.685 --> 38:44.387
Finlay: Mr. Korlov,
the man you knew as "eater,"

38:44.389 --> 38:46.323
With whom
you had those meals...

38:48.492 --> 38:50.593
...Is this him?

38:57.368 --> 38:58.868
This is just flesh.

38:58.870 --> 39:01.638
You can't tell the
true essence of a man

39:01.640 --> 39:03.039
Just by looking
at his flesh.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.908
I asked you a question.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.976
And I would appreciate
an answer.

39:08.412 --> 39:09.946
The being that I dealt with

39:09.948 --> 39:13.750
Looked just like I described
to you and your sketch artist.

39:13.752 --> 39:16.853
A gaunt, glinty-eyed
lucifer himself.

39:18.456 --> 39:20.724
Are you sure you want
to stick with that story?

39:20.726 --> 39:23.393
Because when we find out
that you're lying,

39:23.395 --> 39:25.095
There will be consequences.

39:27.965 --> 39:30.767
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

39:30.769 --> 39:34.938
Is this the man
you knew as "eater"?

39:37.875 --> 39:41.144
A force like "eater" will
never be captured like this.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.146
Ecklie:
<i>That's the horror story</i>

39:43.148 --> 39:44.647
They want us to believe.

39:44.649 --> 39:46.082
Todd burris and
gary korlov

39:46.084 --> 39:47.851
Were in this together.

39:47.853 --> 39:49.986
A murderer and his pr man.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.922
You know, we don't
know that for sure.

39:52.924 --> 39:53.957
(sighs)

39:53.959 --> 39:55.592
Autopsy on burris

39:55.594 --> 39:59.028
Didn't find any human tissue
in his stomach contents.

39:59.030 --> 40:01.998
D.B., the last victim
was attacked two days ago.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.533
Evidence was already digested.

40:03.535 --> 40:05.135
And search of
burris's home

40:05.137 --> 40:06.970
Didn't find trace from
any of the victims.

40:06.972 --> 40:09.105
So he was careful.
What's your point?

40:09.107 --> 40:10.740
What do you mean,
what's my point?

40:10.742 --> 40:12.976
My point is "eater"
could still be out there.

40:12.978 --> 40:14.978
He never existed.
"eater" is a myth.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.913
Todd burris
was the cannibal.

40:16.915 --> 40:20.850
I understand that that's the
most likely explanation, conrad,

40:20.852 --> 40:23.153
But until we find
physical evidence...

40:23.155 --> 40:25.755
D.B., the press release
already went out.

40:27.024 --> 40:29.125
Why would you do that?
What if we're wrong?

40:30.961 --> 40:34.063
Look, I get it, all right?
I've been in your shoes.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.632
World looks different
when you're sitting

40:35.634 --> 40:37.100
Behind a microscope,
tweezing for

40:37.102 --> 40:39.502
Any split hair of doubt...
That's the job!

40:39.504 --> 40:41.504
Well, my job now
is to make the people

40:41.506 --> 40:43.173
In this city feel safe.

40:43.175 --> 40:46.209
All right? Not the ones
dabbling in some deviant corner,

40:46.211 --> 40:48.678
But the rest,
who are living their lives,

40:48.680 --> 40:51.214
Going to work,
supporting their families.

40:51.216 --> 40:54.184
Sounds like you've
decided to run after all.

40:57.221 --> 40:59.222
Case is closed.

41:01.091 --> 41:02.926
News anchor:
<i>Police have identified</i>

41:02.928 --> 41:07.130
The man responsible for the
grisly crimes as todd burris,

41:07.132 --> 41:09.098
A las vegas security guard
who is now deceased.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.099
Woman:
Here you go.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.568
Thank you.
You're welcome.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.770
Been a long one.

41:13.772 --> 41:15.472
That's fine.
Thanks.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.740
...Sheriff conrad ecklie
thanked the city's residents

41:17.742 --> 41:19.709
For their help in apprehending
the perpetrator

41:19.711 --> 41:22.846
And bringing him to justice.

41:28.786 --> 41:31.020
Oh, sorry, sorry.
