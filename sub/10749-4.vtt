00:30.936 --> 00:33.406
The Red Door.

00:36.076 --> 00:40.288
"We don't need no education!"

00:40.380 --> 00:41.343
Yes you do.

00:41.378 --> 00:43.127
You've just used the double negative.

00:50.693 --> 00:51.885
Notice anything?

00:52.067 --> 00:53.696
- What?
- Yes.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.068
Your eyes, something's wrong
with your eyes.

00:56.256 --> 00:57.665
No... I have a new cup.

00:57.711 --> 00:59.016
What's wrong with my eyes?

00:59.072 --> 01:00.797
It's not very distinctive, is it?

01:00.836 --> 01:02.495
How's anyone supposed to know
it's yours?

01:02.534 --> 01:04.120
There's a picture of me on it.

01:05.306 --> 01:06.409
No, there isn't!

01:07.190 --> 01:08.611
- Yes there is.
- No there isn't!

01:08.656 --> 01:10.079
- Moss!
- Yes there is.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.591
I'm sick of my things going walk about.

01:12.785 --> 01:13.900
With this picture,

01:13.951 --> 01:17.684
everyone knows that a certain Mr. Moss
might be looking for his cup...

01:17.767 --> 01:19.375
There is nothing on the cup!

01:19.457 --> 01:22.353
Wrangle with him and you'll find
your handful my friend.

01:22.389 --> 01:23.540
Wrangle! With who?

01:23.649 --> 01:24.983
There's no one there!

01:25.243 --> 01:26.675
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:27.579 --> 01:29.138
Did you have a nice week-end?

01:29.428 --> 01:31.388
- It was alright, thanks.
- Not you!

01:32.129 --> 01:33.385
I did too.

01:34.156 --> 01:35.165
Nice scarf.

01:35.295 --> 01:37.936
- I'm not wearing a scarf.
- Not you, Moss!

01:38.512 --> 01:40.496
Notice anything new about Moss?

01:41.882 --> 01:42.856
His eyes?

01:43.015 --> 01:44.459
What is wrong with my eyes?

01:44.541 --> 01:46.138
No, he has a new cup.

01:46.349 --> 01:47.864
It's the talk of the office.

01:47.940 --> 01:49.936
Yes, I think I read about it in Hits.

01:50.323 --> 01:52.989
Receptionist 3rd floor,
Gloria what's-her-name...

01:53.235 --> 01:55.214
Have you seen her baby?

01:55.495 --> 01:57.332
I didn't even know she was pregnant.

01:57.386 --> 01:58.619
She was onto here!

01:58.806 --> 02:01.472
Yeah, I thought she was stealing
office equipment.

02:02.411 --> 02:04.114
That's how I got that monitor home.

02:13.370 --> 02:15.148
- Do you want to seat here?
- Thank you.

02:19.262 --> 02:21.804
- What?
- Ask me where it is...

02:21.978 --> 02:24.161
- Where what is?
- The picture.

02:26.161 --> 02:27.466
Where is the picture, Moss?

02:27.544 --> 02:28.935
It's on the base, Roy.

02:29.012 --> 02:30.655
OK, well, let's see it then!

02:31.120 --> 02:35.196
Sure, I pour hot water all over myself,
and we all have a good chuckle.

02:35.275 --> 02:36.974
Everyone except muggins here.

02:39.593 --> 02:40.885
Show you in a minute.

02:41.221 --> 02:42.999
Can I ask you two a question?

02:43.088 --> 02:44.557
Please, Christ, yes!

02:44.911 --> 02:46.504
Wait, wait. One moment, wait.

02:49.439 --> 02:50.498
Ok. Go.

02:50.793 --> 02:53.843
How can you two live like this?

02:54.148 --> 02:57.228
- How can you two...
- Don't google the question Moss!

02:58.830 --> 03:00.060
What are you talking about?

03:00.131 --> 03:01.812
It's so disgusting in here.

03:01.847 --> 03:03.635
I mean I know nobody comes down here,

03:03.706 --> 03:06.218
but it doesn't mean you have to live
like animals, you know...

03:06.272 --> 03:08.085
I mean for a start
you could clean that window

03:08.095 --> 03:09.553
and you'd have a bit of light in here.

03:09.588 --> 03:10.668
What window?

03:10.711 --> 03:11.971
That one up there.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.422
Yeah, that's not a window.

03:13.546 --> 03:14.679
Yes it is.

03:14.776 --> 03:17.277
Get it clean, you'll have
some light in here.

03:17.396 --> 03:19.348
I think that we have plenty of light...

03:23.759 --> 03:25.370
light to be doing fine!

03:25.864 --> 03:27.821
I mean look at that CD tray.

03:28.030 --> 03:29.692
Isn't that important,

03:29.924 --> 03:34.021
when you'd like to actually put CDs
in there at some point?

03:34.262 --> 03:35.885
Well, yes, ideally, but

03:36.068 --> 03:37.653
I haven't the heart to move them.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.446
I mean, how did that even happen?

03:45.613 --> 03:47.719
Ok. Now, I'm curious.

03:48.626 --> 03:50.208
Give us a look at the picture then.

03:50.249 --> 03:51.330
What picture?

03:51.427 --> 03:52.857
The picture on the cup.

03:53.088 --> 03:54.101
Right!

03:57.152 --> 03:58.408
Behold!

04:01.419 --> 04:02.675
There's nothing there!

04:03.107 --> 04:04.205
What?!

04:05.157 --> 04:06.450
This isn't my cup!

04:15.541 --> 04:16.866
What is that?

04:17.377 --> 04:18.904
Goat's cheese salad?

04:20.026 --> 04:21.259
You don't like goat's cheese?

04:21.308 --> 04:22.990
I don't like goat's anything!

04:23.820 --> 04:25.230
I don't like goats...

04:25.346 --> 04:28.611
being involved in any stage
of the food production process.

04:29.722 --> 04:32.852
Would I blow everyone's mind
if I ate dessert first?

04:36.752 --> 04:38.452
What are you eating anyway?

04:38.559 --> 04:40.027
It's  a bucket of fried chicken.

04:40.887 --> 04:43.341
You know, it comes in a real bucket now.

04:44.462 --> 04:45.660
Tell me,

04:45.786 --> 04:47.940
what's behind that red door?

04:52.004 --> 04:53.214
Nothing.

04:53.266 --> 04:54.829
Well, there must be something behind it.

04:54.858 --> 04:57.141
There's nothing behind the red door,
Jen.

04:57.188 --> 04:58.674
- Well then I can just go...
- No Jen!

04:58.712 --> 05:00.955
It's just a boring old store room,
that's all.

05:01.050 --> 05:04.065
It's just a store room where we keep
the snibbits.

05:04.325 --> 05:05.697
What's a snibbit?

05:06.567 --> 05:08.074
It's a kind of planch.

05:08.727 --> 05:10.257
A planch for the computers?

05:10.353 --> 05:11.918
Yes. Computer planch.

05:12.092 --> 05:13.947
Well, if it's a store room,

05:14.053 --> 05:16.352
- you can store some of this stuff.
- No! Jen, Jen!

05:16.388 --> 05:19.077
Look, I know that you wanna make
your mark down here and,

05:19.222 --> 05:21.898
and that's really sweet, but,

05:22.072 --> 05:25.570
you can't just go messing around
with the snibbits door room,

05:25.705 --> 05:26.749
willy-nilly.

05:26.873 --> 05:30.797
You... You can't upset the whole harmony
of the place.

05:31.442 --> 05:33.191
Harmony! What harmony?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.745
Look,  I know that the place
looks like a bit of a mess,

05:35.780 --> 05:39.232
but it's actually a very delicate
ecosystem.

05:41.867 --> 05:43.872
Everything is connected.

05:46.890 --> 05:48.839
It's like the rainforest.

05:50.988 --> 05:52.479
You change one thing,

05:53.242 --> 05:54.968
even the tiniest bit,

05:55.085 --> 05:58.296
and the whole rainforest dies.

06:00.926 --> 06:03.814
You don't want the rainforest to die, do you?

06:03.861 --> 06:06.198
No, I really don't want
the rainforest to die.

06:06.368 --> 06:09.080
That's what will happen
if you open the red door.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.069
Hello, I.T., have you tried
turning it off and on again?

06:16.759 --> 06:18.943
Ok, but are you sure
that it's plugged in?

06:20.550 --> 06:21.972
Ok, well I'll be up in a minute.

06:24.143 --> 06:25.365
What was that about?

06:25.728 --> 06:26.656
Just a girl on four.

06:26.753 --> 06:27.774
Oh, a job?

06:27.798 --> 06:28.875
You gonna go?

06:29.110 --> 06:30.730
Yeah. In a while.

06:30.906 --> 06:31.904
It can wait.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.851
But why can it wait?
She probably needs to get on,

06:33.869 --> 06:35.209
she needs her computer, you know.

06:35.218 --> 06:37.428
Yeah well, I am reading a comic.

06:37.879 --> 06:38.843
I knew it.

06:38.888 --> 06:41.212
Every time I used to phone I.T.
in my last job

06:41.247 --> 06:43.936
it's a good couple of hours
before someone got to me.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.462
That is how we do it.

06:45.509 --> 06:47.228
You can't go up straight away

06:47.264 --> 06:48.344
or they'll all expect it.

06:48.371 --> 06:49.576
You're killing the rainforest!

06:49.602 --> 06:51.027
Stop saying that!

06:51.056 --> 06:52.845
Look there's more than that:
me and this girl,

06:52.862 --> 06:53.656
I asked her out once,

06:53.692 --> 06:55.946
she said no, it all got
a little bit embarrassing

06:55.969 --> 06:57.449
and ever since then, whenever I go up,

06:57.484 --> 07:00.766
she treats me like I'm some sort of
sexually frustrated cretin.

07:03.725 --> 07:05.158
Get up there now, please.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.036
You're not the head of this department.

07:07.095 --> 07:08.762
No, I'm relationship manager.

07:08.797 --> 07:10.276
I'm the one you gets the complaints.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.621
I'm the one who gets in trouble.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.152
I'm the one whose name is on the line...

07:13.159 --> 07:14.098
Oh God! All right,

07:14.157 --> 07:16.752
I will go up just to shut you up.

07:17.768 --> 07:20.199
Watch her!

07:42.149 --> 07:43.605
For God's sake!

07:52.820 --> 07:54.559
There's someone under here.

07:55.467 --> 07:56.691
Yes!

07:57.571 --> 07:58.757
Hello!

07:59.352 --> 08:00.447
Hello?

08:08.202 --> 08:09.555
Did you get it fixed?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.438
Oh, yeah.

08:11.544 --> 08:12.633
Well, left him to it.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.236
- Just can't have him in sight.
- Yeah.

08:14.283 --> 08:16.146
Do what you need and just go.

08:30.938 --> 08:32.388
What are you laughing at?

08:32.484 --> 08:34.532
This flipping circuit board, Jen,

08:35.798 --> 08:39.836
Some chump has run the data line
right through the power supply.

08:40.570 --> 08:41.921
Amateur  hour!

08:42.868 --> 08:44.510
I've got tears in my eyes.

08:49.727 --> 08:51.312
Roy's stuck under a desk.

08:52.645 --> 08:54.326
Stuck under a desk?!

08:55.128 --> 08:58.103
Yes. It is an unusual text, isn't it?
It's not just me?

08:58.219 --> 09:00.152
No, it's unusual.

09:00.886 --> 09:02.605
I'd best investigate.

09:02.799 --> 09:03.842
Yes.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.407
You investigate.

09:05.697 --> 09:07.291
I'll hold the fort.

09:53.312 --> 09:55.253
Listen, I'm really sorry
about your hand.

09:55.324 --> 09:58.374
Oh, don't worry about it.
I must have cut it when I swooned.

09:58.422 --> 09:59.838
I startled you a bit.

10:00.383 --> 10:02.296
I didn't know there were anyone else
down here.

10:02.354 --> 10:04.054
I thought it was just the three of us.

10:04.189 --> 10:07.339
I often work at nights so, perhaps
that's why you haven't seen me.

10:07.614 --> 10:09.619
Gosh, it's very cold in here, isn't it?

10:10.102 --> 10:11.474
Air conditioning.

10:11.610 --> 10:13.136
Keep these things cool.

10:13.291 --> 10:14.431
Yes, what are they?

10:14.566 --> 10:15.745
I've no idea.

10:17.774 --> 10:19.243
They have put me in charge of them.

10:19.281 --> 10:20.576
Moss and Roy.

10:21.214 --> 10:22.605
I don't know their names.

10:24.852 --> 10:26.123
I mean,

10:26.528 --> 10:28.801
I don't know any of these stuff
even does.

10:29.139 --> 10:30.647
What's going on there?

10:32.212 --> 10:33.468
I don't know.

10:33.885 --> 10:35.488
Is it good that it's doing that?

10:36.938 --> 10:38.503
Usually, it doesn't do that.

10:38.831 --> 10:40.764
And I think I should tell them, but,

10:40.841 --> 10:42.542
but often I just look away.

10:44.278 --> 10:45.515
And this one:

10:45.902 --> 10:46.887
Flash.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.124
Flash.

10:48.278 --> 10:49.303
Flash.

10:49.419 --> 10:50.404
Then wait for it.

10:50.578 --> 10:51.583
Nothing for a while.

10:52.045 --> 10:53.320
Here it comes.

10:54.595 --> 10:55.948
Double flash.

10:57.243 --> 10:58.306
Brilliant.

11:00.122 --> 11:01.764
It's obvious you are going mad.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.121
So, let me get this straight.

11:04.237 --> 11:06.112
You stay down here all the time.

11:06.884 --> 11:09.714
I pop out occasionally
when I have to get supplies.

11:11.898 --> 11:13.482
And you don't know why you're here,

11:13.598 --> 11:15.009
or what you do.

11:15.182 --> 11:16.206
Correct.

11:16.284 --> 11:19.617
So this is your job?
This is what you want for a career?

11:19.753 --> 11:20.989
No.

11:21.173 --> 11:22.700
You don't understand.

11:22.777 --> 11:25.308
I'm not here because...
I want to be here.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.564
This is...

11:27.104 --> 11:28.805
This is my punishment.

11:30.321 --> 11:33.181
You  see, I used to be Denholm's
second in command.

11:35.567 --> 11:36.843
Do I amaze you?

11:38.516 --> 11:40.545
So, how did you end up down here?

11:41.105 --> 11:44.545
That's the question I've been
asking myself for 4 long years.

11:45.434 --> 11:48.501
Oh I... couldn't help noticing
that you're bleeding.

11:48.559 --> 11:50.301
- Yes. No it's fine it...
- Just let me...

11:50.377 --> 11:51.960
- Please I can help.
- I'll deal

11:51.988 --> 11:53.901
with myself at home
but the risk is, honestly....

11:53.921 --> 11:54.945
Oh  my...

11:55.022 --> 11:55.931
Oh my God.

11:56.780 --> 11:59.002
Please, excuse, excuse me,
what are you doi...

11:59.910 --> 12:01.727
Get off me! Get...

12:06.042 --> 12:07.008
Thank you.

12:07.085 --> 12:08.361
That should clear up nicely.

12:10.148 --> 12:13.047
Yes, there was a time
when things were very different.

12:22.953 --> 12:25.474
<i>I was one of Reynholm Industries'
top guys.</i>

12:25.609 --> 12:27.658
<i>You should have seen me,
I was magical.</i>

12:27.860 --> 12:29.724
<i>Here's me saying some pretty
important stuff</i>

12:29.725 --> 12:31.570
<i>to a group of people circled
around me.</i>

12:32.855 --> 12:34.536
<i>In a boardroom,
I was a wizard.</i>

12:34.671 --> 12:35.946
<i>A punchy character.</i>

12:36.042 --> 12:37.240
<i>Here's me with a graph.</i>

12:39.221 --> 12:40.747
<i>Things were moving fast.</i>

12:40.844 --> 12:44.593
<i>So fast, my career was advancing
by leaps and bounds.</i>

12:45.182 --> 12:47.385
<i>Adam saw greater things for me.</i>

12:48.959 --> 12:50.679
<i>They were crazy heady days.</i>

12:51.838 --> 12:53.964
<i>It seemed like these days
would last forever.</i>

12:54.485 --> 12:55.973
<i>But it all changed.</i>

12:59.973 --> 13:01.731
So, what happened?

13:01.905 --> 13:03.760
It's quite a long story actually.

13:03.799 --> 13:05.866
Really? Don't worry about it then.

13:37.209 --> 13:40.339
Oh my good gracious me, look at that!

13:42.909 --> 13:43.918
Quick!

13:44.258 --> 13:45.207
What is it?

13:45.343 --> 13:46.773
I can't explain it.

13:47.015 --> 13:48.928
You're just going to have to come
over here,

13:49.082 --> 13:51.362
and look out this window for a while.

13:52.821 --> 13:54.753
Whatever it is, we're not interested.

13:54.950 --> 13:58.202
Well. I have to say you're missing out.

13:58.636 --> 13:59.589
Fine.

14:01.718 --> 14:02.955
Jiminy!

14:03.226 --> 14:04.095
Jones!

14:04.173 --> 14:05.802
Look, the nature of the things

14:05.803 --> 14:08.191
that is happening has changed...
slightly,

14:08.558 --> 14:10.827
rendering it yet more interesting.

14:11.570 --> 14:14.071
Someday, I will tell my kids about this.

14:14.410 --> 14:15.885
But you can't even tell us...

14:16.287 --> 14:17.919
How are you gonna tell your children?

14:17.954 --> 14:21.664
Oh, you have no...
interest in the world.

14:30.564 --> 14:31.974
Are you sure it's okay to come out?

14:32.032 --> 14:34.013
Yeah, don't you worry about those two.

14:34.138 --> 14:36.308
And listen Richmond,
I've always wanted to know yeah,

14:36.331 --> 14:38.920
why do you never see
any Cockney Goths?

14:39.306 --> 14:40.582
That's you cheerful.

14:41.895 --> 14:43.432
It's spoiled for the rest of us.

14:43.832 --> 14:46.286
And how come you never see
Goths driving cars?

14:46.557 --> 14:47.851
We drive cars...

14:47.987 --> 14:49.281
We're just like you really...

14:49.436 --> 14:51.194
except that we listen to
Cradle of Filth.

14:52.605 --> 14:54.499
Cradle of Filth,
I presume that's a band.

14:54.976 --> 14:57.847
It's not literally a cradle of filth?

14:57.870 --> 14:59.242
Oh no. That would be horrible.

15:01.561 --> 15:02.786
Cradle of Filth are actually

15:02.838 --> 15:05.703
one the best contemporary
dark-wave bands in the world.

15:07.146 --> 15:09.294
I'll never forget the first time
I heard them.

15:14.037 --> 15:15.428
Changed my life.

15:16.239 --> 15:17.649
Blew my mind.

15:18.364 --> 15:20.722
I was lucky I discovered them
when I did!

15:21.021 --> 15:22.586
Because it was around that time that

15:22.798 --> 15:25.059
things started to go wrong
for me at work.

15:25.348 --> 15:26.798
I don't know what happened.

15:27.281 --> 15:29.696
Suddenly, people just weren't
returning my calls.

15:30.778 --> 15:32.188
In my strategy meetings,

15:32.266 --> 15:33.773
they'd seemed distracted.

15:34.323 --> 15:35.367
Distant.

15:35.483 --> 15:36.835
I couldn't put my finger on it

15:37.096 --> 15:38.623
but something was wrong.

15:39.531 --> 15:40.574
I'll tell you.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.806
It was good to have
the Filth to come home to

15:42.807 --> 15:44.332
after another disappointing day.

15:44.912 --> 15:46.400
You've got to help Roy!

15:46.864 --> 15:48.274
Richmond's out of his room.

15:48.371 --> 15:50.903
He's not in his room,
he's supposed to be in his room.

15:50.941 --> 15:52.641
Why is he out of his room?

15:52.796 --> 15:56.979
Well, he's gotta come out
and play with us for a while.

15:57.114 --> 15:58.564
But the rainforest and...

15:59.530 --> 16:01.056
What's wrong with you Moss?

16:01.597 --> 16:03.646
Roy's stuck underneath a lady's desk.

16:04.108 --> 16:05.118
What! Still?!

16:05.153 --> 16:07.178
Look, I know that normally
this would be very funny

16:07.185 --> 16:09.546
but he's been under there too long
for reasonable explanation.

16:09.574 --> 16:12.090
That woman looks down, she's going
to assume he's a desk rabbit.

16:12.131 --> 16:14.150
- What's a desk rabbit?
- I just made that up.

16:15.584 --> 16:16.814
But that's probably going to be

16:16.815 --> 16:18.438
what they'll sort of call
people like Roy.

16:18.466 --> 16:20.390
But Roy is not a desk rabbit,
he's my best friend.

16:20.418 --> 16:23.110
Unless you do something so tumble you,
me and Tim Burton over there.

16:24.772 --> 16:25.942
What can I possibly do? I...

16:25.950 --> 16:27.691
Look, she could look under there
any minute.

16:27.701 --> 16:29.983
- It could already be too late.
- I don't know what to do...

16:30.011 --> 16:32.251
You're relationship manager,
that falls under relationship.

16:32.270 --> 16:33.591
Alright, alright.

16:33.614 --> 16:34.858
Just shut you up.

16:39.612 --> 16:40.810
Hello Richmond.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.317
How are things?

16:42.463 --> 16:43.549
Oh you know.

16:43.745 --> 16:44.824
Not brilliant.

16:46.904 --> 16:48.658
He's supposed to be in his room.

17:05.027 --> 17:07.920
There's a builder outside,
taking off his shirt.

17:08.090 --> 17:10.539
- Like in ads?
- Yeah, like in ads...

17:23.643 --> 17:25.508
- Easy one downstairs?
- They're fine, yeah.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.776
I left Moss and Richmond in charge.

17:27.861 --> 17:28.974
Good, well Moss...

17:29.076 --> 17:30.952
Richmond!
He's not out of his room, is he?

17:30.988 --> 17:31.821
Yeah.

17:31.845 --> 17:34.397
What did I say about the red door?
I said don't open the red door!

17:34.420 --> 17:36.012
It was the only thing that I asked you!

17:36.013 --> 17:37.262
What have you got against him?

17:37.342 --> 17:38.233
Just don't like him.

17:38.335 --> 17:40.368
Oh God, you're just like
the rest of them,

17:40.385 --> 17:43.368
the people that turn their backs on him
as soon as he became a Goth.

17:43.779 --> 17:45.602
He obviously hasn't told you
about the funeral.

17:46.637 --> 17:49.171
I think that you should ask him
about the funeral.

17:56.288 --> 17:57.280
Hello Denholm.

17:57.443 --> 18:00.062
Hi Jen.
I'm just enjoying this cup of tea.

18:02.210 --> 18:03.040
Brilliant!

18:03.220 --> 18:04.453
How you doing Jen?

18:04.521 --> 18:06.695
Yeah. Just to say...

18:07.825 --> 18:09.708
I met Richmond.

18:10.829 --> 18:11.770
I see.

18:13.157 --> 18:15.082
It's not for me to say Denholm, but

18:15.716 --> 18:18.797
it sounds like you two
had a good relationship at one point.

18:19.918 --> 18:21.510
You should speak to him.

18:21.613 --> 18:23.427
I'll thank you to keep out of this Jen.

18:23.641 --> 18:26.182
- Goths are people to.
- Enough!

18:34.119 --> 18:36.191
There's absolutely no point to anything.

18:36.499 --> 18:40.898
You're right, no point, it's all futile,
can't even find my cup.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.518
Try to look on the bright side.

18:44.672 --> 18:46.931
Ah!  The bright side!

18:47.565 --> 18:48.806
Sometimes, you just think

18:48.926 --> 18:51.878
what would actually change
if I just killed myself.

18:52.768 --> 18:53.915
You're right.

18:54.411 --> 18:56.140
I could just kill myself.

18:56.602 --> 18:58.433
And it'd be so easy, wouldn't it?

18:58.605 --> 19:00.933
So very, very easy.

19:01.780 --> 19:03.167
Richmond!

19:04.966 --> 19:06.180
Get back to your room!

19:06.216 --> 19:08.084
What's the point of sending him
back to him room,

19:08.090 --> 19:09.223
what's the point of anything?

19:09.273 --> 19:11.016
Come on, get brush! Come on!

19:11.132 --> 19:12.484
But she said I could come out.

19:12.508 --> 19:14.750
Well you can't come out.
You're bringing everyone down.

19:14.797 --> 19:16.456
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, he is!

19:16.919 --> 19:18.272
- Come on!
- Thank you.

19:18.427 --> 19:19.934
Okay well then, tell her,

19:20.079 --> 19:22.223
why they sent you down here.
Tell her what you did.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.736
I didn't do anything,
I don't know why I'm down here.

19:24.832 --> 19:26.880
So Denholm just amorted you
for nothing, did he?

19:27.276 --> 19:28.590
No, he changed.

19:28.784 --> 19:31.663
After his father died.
I don't think he ever fully recovered.

19:32.309 --> 19:34.194
From the moment I saw him
at the funeral,

19:34.570 --> 19:36.425
I could tell there was something
different.

19:47.488 --> 19:49.130
Bloody good of you to come, thanks.

19:49.439 --> 19:50.270
Thanks.

19:50.386 --> 19:52.203
Bloody good service, wasn't it? Yeah?

19:53.732 --> 19:55.255
- Thank you.
- Watch your bloody hand!

19:58.308 --> 19:59.412
I'm so sorry.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.315
Here.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.783
It's Cradle of Filth.

20:04.078 --> 20:06.261
It got me through
some pretty bleak times.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.793
Try track 4, Coffin Fodder.

20:09.198 --> 20:11.904
It sounds horrible,
but it's actually quite beautiful.

20:24.782 --> 20:26.367
Relationship manager.

20:28.376 --> 20:29.961
Yes. Yes of course.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.028
First thing tomorrow.

20:35.259 --> 20:36.592
That was Denholm.

20:37.558 --> 20:38.872
He wants to see you.

20:51.405 --> 20:52.738
What is it?!

20:58.420 --> 21:00.101
I can't believe you want me back.

21:00.255 --> 21:01.647
You've got Jen to thank for that.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.029
Her words the other day,
moved me deeply.

21:04.802 --> 21:06.425
Very deeply indeed.

21:06.792 --> 21:08.280
Really? What did she say?

21:08.570 --> 21:09.575
Like I remember!

21:09.729 --> 21:12.280
Point is: it's the effect of her words
that's important.

21:12.983 --> 21:14.761
I now know that treating someone
differently

21:14.819 --> 21:17.283
just because of the colour
of their skin is wrong.

21:17.541 --> 21:20.032
I don't see why things can't get back
to the way they were.

21:21.528 --> 21:22.917
I just don't know what to say.

21:22.941 --> 21:24.493
You're back with the big guys Richmond!

21:24.498 --> 21:25.134
Great!

21:25.157 --> 21:26.954
That's if you're prepared
to take me on again.

21:27.485 --> 21:28.625
You know how demanding I am.

21:29.804 --> 21:30.790
Stop it.

21:30.826 --> 21:32.256
You know how changeable I can be.

21:32.844 --> 21:33.984
Yes Mr. Denholm.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.279
Call me Denholm!

21:35.414 --> 21:36.786
All right, thanks Denholm.

21:37.404 --> 21:39.508
No no. I don't like that.
Don't do it again.

21:39.895 --> 21:40.919
All right, sorry.

21:40.958 --> 21:42.987
In fact, I've changed my mind
about the whole thing.

21:43.122 --> 21:44.764
What? You mean I have to stay down here?

21:44.784 --> 21:45.575
Yes!

21:45.576 --> 21:47.218
And leave me alone you goblin!

21:50.324 --> 21:52.206
Oh well. I suppose it's not quite so bad

21:52.207 --> 21:54.324
now that I don't have
to stay in that room.

21:54.498 --> 21:55.696
Yes, yes.

21:55.768 --> 21:57.725
Well, we're happy to have you.

21:59.424 --> 22:01.182
My milky lens has popped out.

22:03.462 --> 22:04.487
Don't step on it.

22:04.581 --> 22:06.359
You've got... to help me find it.

22:07.325 --> 22:10.397
Oh, actually,
I think it's just popped round the back.

22:10.649 --> 22:12.272
It does that sometimes.

22:13.045 --> 22:13.914
Come on.

22:14.436 --> 22:16.233
Come on. Come on fellow.

22:17.779 --> 22:19.073
Come on.

22:20.201 --> 22:21.159
There.

22:23.911 --> 22:25.418
How about that then?

22:26.481 --> 22:28.104
That looks great!

22:30.191 --> 22:32.046
Told you it was a window.

22:34.087 --> 22:35.111
Bloody lens.

22:41.514 --> 22:42.558
I'd... really ought to...

22:43.080 --> 22:44.683
Actually, I'm gonna...

22:50.051 --> 22:51.543
Thank God.

22:52.258 --> 22:54.499
At least, everything is back to normal.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.572
As long as no one goes through
that door.
