WEBVTT

00:07.883 --> 00:09.123
It looks like
a snow globe.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.544
It's a story catcher.

00:10.677 --> 00:13.384
You hold it in your hand,
you look into the lens

00:13.514 --> 00:16.051
and you describe
a memorable event
about living in Eureka.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.263
Have we had
any of those?

00:17.392 --> 00:18.848
No, nothing
comes to me.
Mmm.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.844
So it's basically
a glorified
video recorder?

00:21.980 --> 00:24.232
Um, more like
a brain recorder.

00:24.358 --> 00:28.101
It creates a wireless
neural connection
through the optic nerve

00:28.237 --> 00:30.899
to see memories,
as you recall them.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.272
Can it help you find
something that's lost,
like a wallet?

00:33.408 --> 00:36.024
You're cute.
No, it's for the Eureka
time capsule project.

00:36.161 --> 00:40.245
All the stories will be
collected and preserved
in a living video diary.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.864
So no pressure?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.742
Okay, so what...
What am I
supposed to say?

00:44.878 --> 00:47.745
Oh, maybe something
about your first time
in Eureka.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.668
Your arrival was
definitely memorable.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.837
Thanks, Vince.
It's a nice way
to put that.

00:52.970 --> 00:55.632
Well, I've kind of
blocked all that
out of my head, so...

00:55.764 --> 00:57.720
Here, let me
refresh your memory.

00:57.849 --> 00:58.838
(BEEPS)

00:59.393 --> 01:00.849
Here we go.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.305

01:03.939 --> 01:08.399

we didn't exactly click.

(BEEPS)

01:16.577 --> 01:17.566
(BEEPS)

01:19.871 --> 01:20.826
Pretty impressive, Jo.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.196
It's Deputy Lupo.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.868
Where'd you learn
to do that anyway?

01:26.044 --> 01:28.421
Well, that explains
some things.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.003
What things?

01:30.757 --> 01:32.793
Nothing.
None of my business.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.508
If you've got something
to say, say it.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.713
Okay. It's just the whole
tough girl image.

01:38.849 --> 01:39.964
I mean, it's fine
and everything,

01:40.100 --> 01:43.308
but some guys might
find it intimidating.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.721
Oh, unless of course
you're into chicks,
and that's fine, too.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.222
Stop talking.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.525
Like a little blonde
ray of sunshine.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.185
Hmm.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.779
Well, you know,
on the plus side,

01:55.907 --> 01:57.989
if this whole
waitressing thing
doesn't work out,

01:58.118 --> 02:00.700
I can always fall back
on my life of crime.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.820
Oh, that's
a good plan.
(CHUCKLES)

02:02.956 --> 02:04.912
So, what? So now that's
recorded on this?
Mmm-hmm.

02:05.042 --> 02:08.876
As you talk, it translates
your synaptic impulses
into images

02:09.004 --> 02:11.290
that can be downloaded
onto my computer in my lab.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.835
Oh, so they're
like happy little
memory balls.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.468
(JO CHUCKLING)

02:15.594 --> 02:17.255
Yeah, just like that.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.764
And this is fun,
but I got birthing class
with Allison.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.006
Oh, yeah, she's in for
the home stretch, huh?

02:22.142 --> 02:24.599
Yeah. I'm on call
24 hours a day.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.890
Tess, can I get
another story thing?

02:28.023 --> 02:29.854
I think mine overloaded.
CARTER: Oh, you think?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.144
You've been the center
of every disaster
this town's ever had.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.778
Not all of them.

02:33.904 --> 02:38.614
Uh, death ray,
homicidal smart house,
ooh, force field bubble.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.607
Yeah, keep a tally.
We'll start a pool.

02:40.744 --> 02:41.950
JO: Yeah.
That's not funny.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.819
Come on.
I gotta go.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.911
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, wait, wait,
don't forget yours.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.660
Think of something good,
will you?

02:53.006 --> 02:54.086
I'll try.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.331
Okay.

02:58.553 --> 03:02.546
So, uh, Tess,
anyone else talk
about me?

03:03.642 --> 03:05.223
That's classified.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.311
I thought
you were closing up.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.438
Do I have to
do everything?

03:19.574 --> 03:21.189
Hi. How's it going?

03:21.326 --> 03:23.112
Hey, ljust tried
to page you.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.110
Why... You didn't
get my message?

03:25.247 --> 03:27.829
(STAMMERS)

03:27.958 --> 03:29.994
Yeah. I must have
left it at the cafe'.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.913
Carter, that pager
has an encrypted signal

03:32.045 --> 03:34.912
that could reach you
in a cave in China
ifl go into labor,

03:35.048 --> 03:36.424
but only if you
don't lose it.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.835
Well, I'll pick it up
right after
the birthing class.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.334
How's that?
Ah, see?
That was the message.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.676
Class has been canceled.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.387
They do a sonic cleaning
of Global Dynamics
once a year.

03:44.516 --> 03:47.929
The entire facility is
shut down for
the long weekend.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.972
But it's graduation day.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.720
I've been practicing
my breathing.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.722
(LAUGHS) Well, you'll
get to use it soon enough.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.599
Hey, and it's my breathing.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.272
Oh, right.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.815
Oh, boy. Um...

04:00.157 --> 04:02.364
You know,
this place is going to
seem empty without you.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.824
Well, I'll only be
on maternity leave
for six weeks.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.365
I'm sure that you
won't even miss me.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.746
Hey, what is
a sonic cleaning,
anyway?

04:09.875 --> 04:14.039
Only the most sophisticated
sterilization process
ever created.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.373
Uh, Carter,
this is Dr. Kinnison.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.007
(YELLING)
Hi. How are you?

04:18.133 --> 04:20.249
(YELLING)
Why are you yelling?

04:20.427 --> 04:23.760
Uh, Dr. Kinnison pioneered
an acoustic cleaning process

04:23.889 --> 04:26.551
that will sterilize
this facility in 48 hours.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.344

We've got three stragglers,
Ashe, Bubay and Fargo.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.558
I'm sure they're
still locking up.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.435
Hmm.
(CHUCKLES)

04:40.572 --> 04:42.984

that any biological

04:43.116 --> 04:44.617
have been removed
or contained

04:44.743 --> 04:47.530

have been secured.

You can help me.

Nothing. I've never
seen it before.
I found it in my pocket.

turn it on.

this for Dr. Fontana.

The cleaning's
about to start.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.373
Right. I have
this nagging feeling

07:06.509 --> 07:08.841
there's something
I was supposed to do.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.006
Like securing
your experiment?

07:11.473 --> 07:12.588
That sounds familiar.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.511
Now what experiment
would that be exactly?

07:29.658 --> 07:31.990
I'm gonna guess
that experiment.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.302
Unbelievable.
What happened?

07:53.014 --> 07:53.878
Ifl had to
take a guess,

07:54.015 --> 07:59.305
I'd say that
someone's chemical mixture
became unstable and ignited.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.687
You're supposed to
monitor these things
so that this doesn't happen.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.147

on that project?

an off-site infirmary.
I'll have him checked out.

Is this yours?

11:47.624 --> 11:49.785
Thanks. I was wondering
where that was.

11:49.918 --> 11:50.873
Yeah. Okay.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.084
Why don't you come
with me? We're going to
check you out, okay?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.828
Okay.
All right?

11:55.465 --> 11:56.705
So, I spoke to Henry.

11:56.841 --> 12:00.584
They're suffering
from lacunar amnesia,
selective memory loss.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.304
So they can
remember their work
but not each other?

12:04.432 --> 12:05.672
Well, so far.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.094
But if the pathways
in their striate cortex
get infected,

12:08.228 --> 12:10.014
this could turn into
retrograde amnesia.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.886
So what could cause it?
I mean, it seems odd

12:12.023 --> 12:15.140
that they'd suffer
from the same thing
at exactly the same time.

12:15.276 --> 12:18.768
I don't know. Trauma, injury.
Maybe exposure
to chemicals in their lab.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.361
All clear,
Dr. Blake.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.607
I found Fargo
in Lab 511
and hustled him out.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.859
Well, that's Tess' lab.
What's he doing down there?

12:25.995 --> 12:29.487
(STAMMERS) Wait,
is that where she keeps
the time capsule thingy?

12:29.624 --> 12:30.830
Yeah. Why?

12:30.959 --> 12:32.699
Okay, can you hold
the cleaning
until we get back?

12:32.835 --> 12:34.826
No problem.
Oh, thanks.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.294
There you go.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.289
I don't understand.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.292
I found one of
Tess' memory balls
inside Dr. Ashe's pocket

12:42.428 --> 12:44.419
and Henry said
that Dr. Bubay
has one, too.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.170
(TYPING)
Yeah, that's because
everyone has one.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.093
Well, is it possible
that the recording
of these memories

12:48.226 --> 12:49.807
somehow makes people
forget them?

12:49.936 --> 12:50.891
No, it doesn't
work that way.

12:51.020 --> 12:55.138
The neural link copies
memories to the story nest,
it doesn't erase them.

12:55.275 --> 12:59.314
Huh. It's through that
that you guys can
watch the recordings?

12:59.445 --> 13:03.188
Well, you just
input a memory and put
the Halo interface on.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.032
Awesome.

13:06.995 --> 13:07.984
(ALARM SOUNDING)

13:08.121 --> 13:10.282
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Sterilization protocols
initiated.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.406
ALLISON: Oh, no.
You told me to put it on.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.874
No, no, no, not you.
Kinnison must have started
the sonic cleaning.

13:15.003 --> 13:15.992
I'll hit the failsafe.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.244
Okay.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.007
Tell me the failsafe
didn't just fail.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.802
It should have been activated
as standard safety protocol.

13:29.934 --> 13:33.802
AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning.
Sonic sterilization
to commence in 60 minutes.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.475
What does a sonic
sterilization do?

13:36.607 --> 13:39.019
Well, it fires a blast
of coherent phonons

13:39.152 --> 13:42.644
that vibrate
any organic matter
at a subatomic level.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.319
Sounds uncomfortable.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.906
Well, it will completely
dismantle any germs,
allergens,

13:47.035 --> 13:48.900
or biological impurities,

13:49.037 --> 13:50.652
including us.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.249
(BANGING ON DOOR)

14:02.592 --> 14:04.002
(BEEPING)

14:04.135 --> 14:06.126
No one's answering.
Everyone's left
the building.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.093
All right, well,
let's try to call someone
outside the building.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.177
You want to try Henry?

14:09.307 --> 14:12.390
Section Five blocks
standard cell signals.
Security issues.

14:12.518 --> 14:16.761
AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning.
Sonic sterilization
to commence in 50 minutes.

14:16.898 --> 14:18.763
Okay. Um...

14:18.900 --> 14:20.606
There's got to be
some way to contact
someone, though, right?

14:20.735 --> 14:22.771
The G.D. communication
network shuts down

14:22.904 --> 14:24.860
to minimize
electrical interference
during the cleaning.

14:24.989 --> 14:29.483
But the failsafe should
have sent an emergency alert
to Kinnison.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.569
Let's hope
he can hear it.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.161
(BEEPING)

14:40.380 --> 14:41.961
Dr. Kinnison.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.924
You're beeping.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.041
Right. Sorry.
Could I get
a refill please?

14:46.177 --> 14:47.292
Sure.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.295
Huh?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.010
I wonder what
that means.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.644
Here you go.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.886
Uh, Jo, your soup's
coming right up.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.105
(STAMMERS)
I ordered soup?

15:01.984 --> 15:03.770
White bean
with truffles.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.938
Sounds good.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.652
Hi, Henry.
Hey.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.066
Hey, Henry.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.615
You okay?

15:10.743 --> 15:14.156
Aside from being
painfully average,
yeah, I'm super.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.243
(LAUGHS) What?

15:15.373 --> 15:17.739
She's having a little trouble
thinking of a story
for the time capsule.

15:17.875 --> 15:18.910
Uh-huh.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.329
Because I haven't done
anything that exceptional.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.793
I mean, as entertaining
as they may be,

15:22.922 --> 15:25.413
I don't think
anyone wants to hear
about my mistakes.

15:25.550 --> 15:29.543
Well, you know
that mistakes make
exceptional possible.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.298
Well, here, look.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.420
(BEEPS)

15:32.557 --> 15:35.845
For example, um,
when you and your dad
came into town,

15:35.977 --> 15:38.343
I was tinkering
in my garage.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.139
Here goes nothing.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.269
Yeah.

15:47.905 --> 15:48.894
(LAUGHING)

15:51.993 --> 15:54.985
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

16:11.429 --> 16:14.717
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.391
HENRY: That failure
changed our approach

16:22.523 --> 16:25.640
to creating
artificial gravity
for space travel.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.400
Yeah!

16:27.528 --> 16:28.517
(LAUGHS)

16:29.238 --> 16:35.029
So, here in Eureka,
mistakes can lead
to new directions.

16:35.161 --> 16:38.198
Sometimes the wrong path
leads to the right path.

16:38.331 --> 16:42.574
So just give it time
and you will find
your own path.

16:43.002 --> 16:43.957
(CHUCKLES)

16:44.587 --> 16:46.043
Thanks, Henry.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.333
When did I order soup?

16:54.764 --> 16:58.256
I just don't understand
how Kinnison could forget
that we're down here.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.849
Well, everyone was given
a story catcher, right?

17:00.978 --> 17:03.390
Oh, my God, including him,
which means
the amnesia is spreading.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.512
We have to
get out of here.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.014
All right, we have
to break our way out.

17:06.150 --> 17:10.940
Right. Through a titanium door
that can take 20 tons
per square inch of pressure.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.276
Why is everything
such overkill
with you people?

17:14.408 --> 17:16.990
Well, it's supposed
to keep us safe.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.451
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. ljust...

17:19.580 --> 17:21.445
| just don't know
how this happened.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.992
It's okay.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.784
We're going to
figure it out.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.999
But first,

17:30.049 --> 17:32.540
I'd like to figure out
what Fargo was doing
down here.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.087
How do I use this?
| just put it on?

17:34.220 --> 17:37.007
Yeah. Just close your eyes
and say a name.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.676
Show me Douglas Fargo.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.889
(IN SPANISH)

(IN SPANISH)

18:43.581 --> 18:45.037
(IN SPANISH)

19:23.120 --> 19:28.205
There's only one memory,
and it's a shared dream
with Fargo as a hero.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.870
Well, what were
you expecting?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.958
Well, lots.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.999
I mean, the guy
never met a button
he didn't push.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.918
He is pathological.

19:37.051 --> 19:37.961
Yeah.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.679
And, I mean,
Fargo was irritated
this morning

19:40.805 --> 19:44.718
when he found out that
people's memories were going
to make him look like Fargo.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.262
Well, what would
make him think that?

19:48.521 --> 19:49.852
Well, me.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.561
Great. Good job.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.680
(TYPING)

19:52.817 --> 19:55.729
You know what? You're right.
Dozens of files have been
deleted from the mainframe.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.943
If Fargo erased memories
from the story nest

19:58.072 --> 19:59.903
while the neural connection
was still active,

20:00.032 --> 20:02.489
it could start
wiping people's minds.

20:05.496 --> 20:08.613
You know, actually,
if the neural connection
is still active,

20:08.749 --> 20:10.785
I might be able
to use the story nest

20:10.918 --> 20:13.159
to make contact
with people
outside of G.D.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.796
Great. And you know
how to do that?

20:14.922 --> 20:19.131
Yeah, ljust have
to access the mainframe,
then I should be able to...

20:21.220 --> 20:22.335

this come from?

to access the neural net

24:17.539 --> 24:18.870
You gave me a pager.

24:18.999 --> 24:22.332
It has a super signal
so that you can reach me
in a cave in China.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.416
Do you remember that?

24:23.545 --> 24:25.046
Yeah. I remember
that you forgot it.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.378
Right. At Cafe Diem.

24:26.507 --> 24:29.340
Now, is that on
the same network as G.D.?

24:29.802 --> 24:30.837
Um...

24:30.970 --> 24:32.926
No, no. I think it has
its own frequency.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.046
Great. Give me yours.
Oh, okay.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.888
Uh, what for?

24:38.268 --> 24:40.975
I think we have a shot
at getting out of here.

24:44.942 --> 24:46.648
(PAGER BEEPING)

24:46.777 --> 24:49.359
Hey, Vince,
I'm still waiting
on that cordon bleu.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.400
Oh, my goodness.
That sounds delicious.
I'll take one.

24:52.533 --> 24:53.648
What?

24:56.286 --> 24:58.993
Dr. Kinnison, please,
that PDA is driving
me crazy.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.239
What are you
talking about?

25:01.375 --> 25:02.535
That.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.575
That's not me.
(BEEPING CONTINUES)

25:05.587 --> 25:07.543
Oh, for the love of God!

25:16.056 --> 25:19.423
"911, trapped in S-5,
L-511. Help."

25:19.935 --> 25:21.175
What are you
talking about?

25:21.311 --> 25:23.973
My dad's pagerjust
got this from Allison.
She says she's trapped...

25:24.106 --> 25:25.846
What's "S-5, L-511"?

25:25.983 --> 25:28.690
That's Section Five,
Lab 511. That's my lab.

25:28.819 --> 25:31.811
But they just shut G.D. down
for a sonic cleaning today.

25:31.947 --> 25:35.485
Tess, my dad
didn't come back after
that birthing class.

25:36.201 --> 25:40.535
Hey, Jo, Fargo,
have you guys seen
Allison or Carter?

25:42.875 --> 25:45.287
Are you serious?
Tess, what the hell's
going on?

25:45.419 --> 25:49.628
I don't know.
Henry, we have to get to G.D.
Something is really wrong.

25:49.757 --> 25:51.372
Uh, sorry.
What's G.D.?

25:51.925 --> 25:53.051
(GASPS) What?

25:53.719 --> 25:57.758
Kinnison, you need to use
your PDA to shut down
the sonic cleaning at G.D.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.505
There are people
still in there.

25:59.641 --> 26:00.972
Oh. Uh...

26:01.185 --> 26:02.220
Sonic cleaning?

26:02.352 --> 26:04.809
Okay, never mind.
I'm going to
borrow this.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.644
Is that okay?
Sure.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.139
It's not mine.

26:09.359 --> 26:11.224
Zoe, come on. Let's go.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.478
(CHUCKLES) What
was all that about?

26:14.615 --> 26:16.025
I have no idea.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.657
So you come
here often?

26:21.538 --> 26:25.827
AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning.
Sonic sterilization
to commence in 20 minutes.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.866
Well, hopefully somebody
will find my pager.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.415
Well, watching
the memory helped.

26:31.340 --> 26:32.580
It did?

26:32.716 --> 26:34.923
(STAMMERS) Well,
we can focus on the ones
that had the most impact

26:35.052 --> 26:37.418
and those memories
could bring back others.

26:37.554 --> 26:40.091
Well, the strongest memories
are tied to emotions.

26:40.224 --> 26:43.716
Well, we've definitely
been witness
to a lot of those.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.138
All right, well,
you better show me.

26:48.065 --> 26:49.180
Okay.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.854
Um...

26:55.948 --> 26:58.655
"Allison Blake
and Nathan Stark."

27:03.705 --> 27:06.321
Allison Blake
and Nathan Stark.

27:07.251 --> 27:08.491
Nathan?

27:09.503 --> 27:10.492
Allison.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.960
I swear
I was just about
to call you.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.374
You're moving back
to Eureka?

27:13.507 --> 27:15.213
Moved actually.
Yesterday.

27:15.342 --> 27:18.459
Same office, same house.
Surprise!

27:20.097 --> 27:22.213
Nathan, thank you.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.173
Now you're official.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.300
I've made up my mind.
So have I.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.637
(CLEARS THROAT)
Uh, hey, guys.

27:30.774 --> 27:31.809
Kind of busy.

27:31.942 --> 27:34.024
Yeah, I need to
talk to Allison.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.609
About what?

27:36.196 --> 27:41.156
Nathan,
Global needs you.
I need you.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.287
Really?

27:45.998 --> 27:47.829
And Carter's right,
the two of you do
work well together.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.870
Oh, you just know
how to ruin the moment.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.835
I won't be happy
until we're together.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.544
Marry me, Allie.

27:58.969 --> 28:00.425
Again.

28:02.681 --> 28:03.796
Hey.

28:04.474 --> 28:06.305
(LAUGHS) Are you ready?

28:08.312 --> 28:09.973
Momentous, huh?

28:10.314 --> 28:11.474
Yeah.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.108
I'll always be
here for you.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.769
You know that, right?

28:18.906 --> 28:20.521
No matter what.

28:20.949 --> 28:23.986
Are you okay?
You look pale.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.280
Carter.

28:36.924 --> 28:38.380
Where's Nathan?

28:40.344 --> 28:41.629
(GASPING)

28:48.101 --> 28:49.602
(CRYING SOFTLY)

29:04.117 --> 29:05.573
I remember.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.735
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

29:10.624 --> 29:13.240
I thought I was going to
lose you there.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.627
You'll never lose me.

29:18.006 --> 29:22.124
AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning.
Sonic sterilization
to commence in 15 minutes.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.843
Allison, if that page
didn't reach anyone,

29:24.972 --> 29:28.760
you're the only one
who can get us
out of here. So...

29:29.726 --> 29:31.182
Okay, I'll try.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.808
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

29:37.734 --> 29:38.940
Allie?
Hmm?

29:41.029 --> 29:43.441
You're crushing
the bones in my hand.

29:44.825 --> 29:47.908
Oh, that was
a contraction.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.861
I just started
my labor.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.245
Ooh!

29:55.877 --> 29:57.162
Oh, boy.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.968
If we don't get out
of here soon, there's
going to be three of us.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.382
Yeah.

30:08.515 --> 30:12.099
You were saying you thought
you could call for help
using the neural net?

30:12.227 --> 30:14.309
Yeah, ifl could
remember how it works.

30:14.438 --> 30:17.396
Breathe. Breathe.
Just like in class.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

30:17.983 --> 30:22.067
I know, Carter.
The classes were
for you, not for me.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.310
Oh.

30:23.447 --> 30:27.190
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Sonic sterilization
to commence in 12 minutes.

30:27.784 --> 30:28.819
This is really bad.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.785
Yeah. Well, we've been
through worse, so...

30:32.998 --> 30:34.784
That is an unfortunate
choice of word.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.623
(STAMMERS) We've
been through a lot,

30:37.753 --> 30:41.587
and I need you to
remember everything

30:41.715 --> 30:43.922
if we stand a chance
of getting out of here.

30:44.051 --> 30:45.712
Okay, show me more.

30:49.306 --> 30:51.888
Say, "Show me Eureka."

30:54.269 --> 30:55.679
Show me Eureka.

30:56.396 --> 31:00.105
Here's to scientific leaps
and the beginning
of the universe.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.176
Hang on!

31:37.312 --> 31:39.428
We're at 1,000 degrees.
You have to do it now.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.770
I'm trying!

31:40.899 --> 31:42.105
(GRUNTING)

31:43.860 --> 31:46.021
How hard is it
to push a button?

31:46.822 --> 31:47.937
(SHOUTING)
You want to do it?

31:48.073 --> 31:49.279
Carter!

31:57.124 --> 32:00.161
You're right.
We've had some rough times,
but this is worse.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.284
But I am getting
my memories back.

to commence in 10 minutes.

32:06.383 --> 32:07.873
(GROANING)
And that's not helping!

32:08.009 --> 32:11.797
Okay, okay, you can do this.
You can do this.
What do you need?

32:11.972 --> 32:14.008
Just give me the keypad.
I'll try.

32:14.141 --> 32:15.722
Okay. There you go.
Okay. What...

32:15.851 --> 32:17.807
Get this thing
off of me.

32:19.688 --> 32:20.894
Wait. You know
what to do?

32:21.022 --> 32:22.808
Yeah, check your lab
for Allison and Dad.

32:22.941 --> 32:23.930
While I shut off
the sonic cleaning.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.149
Wait, wait, hold on.
I don't have clearance
for Section Five.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.393
I mean, you had
to override security

32:27.529 --> 32:28.814
just to get me through
the front door, right?

32:28.947 --> 32:30.653
Oh, okay.
Come here.

32:32.409 --> 32:33.398
Uh...

32:34.786 --> 32:37.027
Press your thumb down
right there.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.163
You now have
complete access
to Section Five.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.498
Really? Awesome.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.207
Just don't
touch anything.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.872
I'll be in
Allison's office.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.664
I've tried to
override the system,
but this isn't working.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.006
I'm sorry.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.046
(SIGHING)
It's okay.

32:52.846 --> 32:54.336
We'll, uh...

32:55.432 --> 32:57.047
We'll find another way.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.933
This isn't
how I pictured
things going.

33:01.730 --> 33:02.970
I know.

33:03.273 --> 33:05.889
It's bad timing.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.103
(SIGHING) Hmm.

33:08.403 --> 33:10.894
I'm really happy
that you're here.

33:19.915 --> 33:22.327
I'll always
be here for you.

33:25.045 --> 33:26.535
No matter what.

33:28.048 --> 33:31.882
You know, this isn't
how I pictured it
going for us, either.

33:32.302 --> 33:33.417
Yeah.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.591
Bad timing.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.430
Okay.

33:40.060 --> 33:42.517
Dad!
Zoe, how did
you get in here?

33:42.896 --> 33:45.182
Tess violated
about a dozen
security protocols.

33:45.315 --> 33:46.475
Awesome!
Where is she?

33:46.608 --> 33:47.563
Um, she's shutting down
the sonic cleaning.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.273
Oh, thank God. Oh!

33:49.778 --> 33:51.643
Allison. Oh, wow.

AUTOMATED VOICE:
Sonic sterilization

33:55.492 --> 33:56.481
You said she was
shutting that down.

33:56.618 --> 33:57.903
She was.

33:58.954 --> 34:00.410
Where were you
when you two split?

34:00.539 --> 34:02.279
Um, in the rotunda,
about five minutes ago.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.121
Okay, it takes five seconds
to get to my office.

34:04.251 --> 34:05.707
Something's wrong,
you better go find her.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.575
Okay.
And I'm in no shape to move.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.248
You have to stop
the sonic cleaning.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.871
Yeah, Zoe?
Yeah, Dad, I'll stay
with her. Go.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.123
Okay. Time the contractions.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.375
Okay.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.338
Come here.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.551
Okay.

34:17.681 --> 34:20.047
Uh, you okay?
(GROANING) No.

34:23.311 --> 34:26.599
Oh, thank God.
How's it going?

34:27.482 --> 34:30.519
Hi, I'm Tess.
And you would be?

34:32.946 --> 34:34.436
Totally screwed.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.612
Tess, my name is Jack.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.574
And Fargo has...
You know Fargo.

34:47.711 --> 34:51.750
And, yeah, he messed
with something of yours
called a story nest.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.592
Now, what it's doing
is making the entire town
lose their memories.

34:54.718 --> 34:56.128
AUTOMATED VOICE: Two minutes
before sonic sterilization.

34:56.261 --> 35:00.129
You have two minutes
to shut off
a sonic sterilization.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.171
Sonic...

35:02.309 --> 35:03.594
Okay, um,

35:03.727 --> 35:06.810
your name is
Tess Fontana.
Uh...

35:07.522 --> 35:10.764
You run Section Five,
and right now
you are the only one

35:10.900 --> 35:14.028
who can save
the lives of everyone
in this facility.

35:14.154 --> 35:15.815
Okay, you're
really starting
to freak me out here.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.608
Okay, okay.

35:17.866 --> 35:21.029
Um, do you even remember
arriving in Eureka?

35:23.121 --> 35:24.702
Well, no.
No.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.246
Do you remember
being caught
in another dimension?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.411
Another... No.

35:30.879 --> 35:33.165
Do you remember
the meteor shower?

35:34.466 --> 35:35.672
Go on.

35:36.509 --> 35:37.498
Um...

35:38.470 --> 35:42.588
It was you and me
and we were on
the hood of my jeep.

35:43.892 --> 35:47.180
And I held your hand.

35:48.396 --> 35:49.897
And it was dark.

35:50.023 --> 35:51.559
Okay, wait, wait.

35:51.691 --> 35:54.228
Wait, this is starting
to come back to me now, um...

35:54.361 --> 35:56.272
Keep going,
give me more.
Give me...

36:05.955 --> 36:07.286
(SOFTLY) Hey.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.757
Jack.
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Sonic sterilization...

36:19.886 --> 36:23.003
Okay. You have to shut off
the sonic sterilization.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.640
Okay. Okay.

36:24.766 --> 36:29.055
AUTOMATED VOICE:
...28, 27, 26...

36:29.187 --> 36:30.427
Tess?

36:30.563 --> 36:32.770
Hold on.
It'll come to me.

36:32.899 --> 36:36.812
It could be a code
or a sequence
or a protocol.

36:36.945 --> 36:38.651
You tend to
love protocols.

36:38.780 --> 36:39.769
I love protocols.

36:39.906 --> 36:42.739
AUTOMATED VOICE:
...18, 17...

36:42.867 --> 36:44.573
What? What is it?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.113
Kinnison's PDA.

36:46.830 --> 36:50.322
Okay. I think
if! swipe it, maybe...
(TYPING)

36:50.458 --> 36:53.040
AUTOMATED VOICE:
...10, 9...

36:53.169 --> 36:55.205
Sonic procedures canceled.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.913
Sterilization protocols
deactivated.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.205
That's it?

36:59.342 --> 37:01.924
I'm sorry, I just forgot.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.673
Okay, Tess,
this isn't over.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.888
Unless we permanently
reverse what Fargo's done,

37:07.016 --> 37:09.302
everyone in the town
is going to
lose their memory.

37:09.436 --> 37:10.346
Fargo, he's at the cafe.

37:10.478 --> 37:11.888
Okay, get him here
as quick as you can.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.181
Okay.
Where are you going?

37:13.314 --> 37:15.441
I have to deliver a baby.
A baby?

37:15.567 --> 37:16.773
(WAILS)

37:16.901 --> 37:19.017
Okay, so how far
apart are they?

37:19.154 --> 37:22.066
Uh, 90 seconds.
I think you're in transition.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.235
How in God's name
do you know that?

37:24.367 --> 37:26.904
Tesla's sex ed classes
can be pretty thorough.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.901
Okay, I'm going to have
to start pushing soon.

37:29.038 --> 37:29.868
Don't forget to breathe.

37:29.998 --> 37:30.987
Yeah, you, too.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.079
Okay.
Here we go.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.539
You sure you're
up for this?

37:33.668 --> 37:34.748
I am your partner.

37:34.878 --> 37:35.993
Okay.

37:36.129 --> 37:37.539
(MOANING)

37:39.424 --> 37:40.789
I got him.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.298
Oh, you could warn a guy.
What?

37:43.428 --> 37:44.588
How did you
get his memory back?

37:44.721 --> 37:47.633
Remote Halo.
Jo's story catcher
had some doozies.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.803
Yeah, and now I remember
all my failures.
Thanks for that.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.221
Just fix it so I don't forget
the birth of my daughter.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.185
All right,
now's your chance
for redemption, Fargo.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.806
But I'm not
exactly sure
what I did.

37:57.942 --> 37:58.897
Um...

37:59.027 --> 38:02.815
She started doing something
with the neural net,
the neural connection.

38:02.947 --> 38:06.030
Right. Maybe we can
reverse the neural flow...

38:06.159 --> 38:07.239
(ALLISON SHOUTING)

38:07.368 --> 38:09.859
That is making it
very difficult
to concentrate.

38:09.996 --> 38:13.329
I'm sorry for distracting you.
Okay, she's coming.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.914
Ready?
Uh-huh.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.159
Push.
(WAILS)

38:17.295 --> 38:19.001
Oh, my God. I see her.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.245
(MUMBLING GIBBERISH)

38:20.381 --> 38:21.416
Would you...
What are you doing?

38:21.549 --> 38:23.881
I'm trying to generate
a large-scale upload.

38:24.010 --> 38:25.250
If it works,
all the recorded memories

38:25.386 --> 38:26.796
should be transmitted
back to everyone

38:26.930 --> 38:29.672
in one giant burst
through their story catchers.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.924
Fargo, that is brilliant.

38:32.393 --> 38:34.725
Or it'll permanently
erase them.

38:35.688 --> 38:37.189
I don't want us
to forget this.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.055
We won't. We won't.
Okay.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.770
Okay.
All right, this is it.

38:41.903 --> 38:42.892
You can do it, Allie.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.769
You can do it, Fargo.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.271
What if I push this button

38:46.407 --> 38:49.945
and permanently erase
the greatest scientific minds
of the 21st century?

38:50.078 --> 38:51.739
Push the button, Fargo!

38:51.871 --> 38:53.452
It's a lot of pressure.

38:53.581 --> 38:54.866
Push the button!
Push the button!

38:54.999 --> 38:57.285
But Eureka might
forget itself!

38:57.627 --> 38:59.788
Push the damn button, Fargo!

38:59.921 --> 39:01.127
(GROANS)

39:02.340 --> 39:03.625
(BEEPING)

39:17.564 --> 39:18.974
(EXCLAIMS)

39:24.320 --> 39:25.275
One more time.
Okay.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.815
She's almost here, okay?
Okay.

39:26.948 --> 39:27.983
Push.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.105
(YELLING)

39:31.244 --> 39:32.279
What are you...

39:34.122 --> 39:35.111
(PLATE SHATTERS)

39:39.752 --> 39:40.741
Yes!

39:40.879 --> 39:42.119
Hey, whoa, all right.
Easy, easy!

39:42.255 --> 39:43.836
(SCREAMING)
Oh, crap.

39:46.634 --> 39:47.623
This.

39:48.595 --> 39:49.710
This.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.098
(EXCLAIMS)

40:00.064 --> 40:02.396
Get everybody
out of there! Now!

40:04.485 --> 40:06.396
These are the moments
we're going to
remember the most.

40:06.529 --> 40:07.609
If we're lucky.

40:20.919 --> 40:21.954
Henry.

40:22.587 --> 40:23.918
When did you get here?

40:24.047 --> 40:25.628
I'm not sure.

40:25.757 --> 40:29.500
Um, but you know what?
That soup smells good.

40:30.053 --> 40:32.339
I... I'll get you some.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.716
Has anyone seen my PDA?

40:39.228 --> 40:42.140
I think you
did it, Fargo.
I did, didn't I?

40:42.690 --> 40:44.430
Take that, posterity.

40:47.236 --> 40:48.487
Oh, wow.

40:48.821 --> 40:49.901
Oh, God.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.737
(SIGHS)

40:52.951 --> 40:56.614
Say hello
to your daughter.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.320
Hey, there.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.864
That was amazing.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.036
You were amazing,
both of you.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.000
I don't even remember.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.919
Hey, that's not funny.

41:07.048 --> 41:08.128
(ALL CHUCKLE)

41:08.800 --> 41:10.336
She is beautiful.

41:11.344 --> 41:12.754
What's her name?

41:12.887 --> 41:14.502
This is Jenna.

41:14.931 --> 41:16.216
Jenna Stark.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.097
After Nathan's mom.

41:18.226 --> 41:19.841
Well, hi, Jenna.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.843
(BABY CRYING)

41:23.106 --> 41:25.097
I guess I'm officially
on maternity leave.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.098
Yeah, you've earned it.

41:28.236 --> 41:31.478
So what do you think, Tess?
You think you can handle
this place on your own?

41:31.614 --> 41:32.569
Me?

41:32.699 --> 41:35.941
Well, you're already doing
a greatjob in Section Five,

41:36.077 --> 41:38.693
and clearly you can
handle a crisis.

41:39.122 --> 41:42.990
Yeah, I'll try to
keep those to a minimum
while you're gone.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.415
Well, I'd appreciate it.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.160
(FARGO MOANS)

41:50.883 --> 41:52.009
You okay?

41:53.302 --> 41:55.133
That's a memory
I wish I could forget.

41:55.263 --> 41:57.424
We will pretend
that you did.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.841
She's so wrinkly,
but cute.

42:00.977 --> 42:02.683
(SOFTLY) I know. I know.

42:05.023 --> 42:06.354
You okay?

42:06.983 --> 42:08.723
I'm better than okay.

42:09.068 --> 42:12.231
I think I might have
found my path.

42:14.657 --> 42:16.818
So much for
the time capsule.

42:16.951 --> 42:19.613
Yeah, well, um,
when you fix it,

42:19.746 --> 42:22.488
I think I know
what memory
I'd like to use.

42:22.707 --> 42:23.992
What's that?

42:25.460 --> 42:26.996
I think this one.

42:31.007 --> 42:32.463
Hey, yeah.

42:32.884 --> 42:35.000
Carter. Carter.
