WEBVTT

00:02.043 --> 00:03.253
- Ace McFumbles here.

00:03.336 --> 00:06.589
In two days, it's the Parents
&amp; Pigskins Game.

00:06.673 --> 00:07.924
Bulldogs players
and their parents

00:08.007 --> 00:09.134
will team up for
flag football.

00:09.217 --> 00:13.805
You'll see screaming,
whining, and bad sportsmanship.

00:13.888 --> 00:15.807
And that's just the parents.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.976
Here's a highlight
from last year.

00:18.059 --> 00:21.438
He's at the ten,
the nine, the eight.

00:22.897 --> 00:25.150
[sighing]
I love this game.

00:25.233 --> 00:29.612
It always makes me feel
better about my own life.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.114
- [whistle shrills]

00:31.197 --> 00:32.907
- All right, Bulldogs,
after hours of deliberation,

00:32.991 --> 00:35.702
I've carefully
selected the teams

00:35.785 --> 00:38.037
for the Parents
&amp; Pigskins Game.

00:41.541 --> 00:44.043
- You just threw the magnets
on the board, didn't you?

00:44.127 --> 00:46.880
- Didn't even open
my eyes for it.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.715
- Newt, we're
on the same team.

00:48.798 --> 00:49.674
- [palm slap]

00:49.758 --> 00:51.050
- Well, looks like it's
you and me, Troy.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.635
Are you playing
with your mom?

00:52.719 --> 00:53.887
- Nah, she's got work

00:53.970 --> 00:55.305
and my dad's still
deployed overseas,

00:55.388 --> 00:56.890
so, I think I'm gonna
ask my Uncle Milton.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.975
- Oh, is he any
good at football?

00:59.058 --> 01:00.351
- Well, he spends all day
doing computer security

01:00.435 --> 01:01.811
for the government,
so, I doubt it.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.315
- Oh, he works
with computers.

01:05.397 --> 01:06.274
Interesting.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.359
Sawyer, can I talk
to you for a second?

01:08.443 --> 01:09.402
- Yeah.

01:09.486 --> 01:12.864
- Did you hear that?
Troy's uncle is a nerd.

01:12.947 --> 01:16.534
- So, are you guys
startin' a club?

01:16.618 --> 01:18.328
- No.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.622
This is my chance to finally
beat Troy at something.

01:20.705 --> 01:22.123
He beats me at everything.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.459
But this time,
I'm gonna win.

01:24.542 --> 01:25.251
My dad's really good.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.253
He played four
years in college.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.171
And your dad was all-state
in football, right?

01:28.254 --> 01:32.050
- Yep, all six years
of high school.

01:32.133 --> 01:35.929
- Yes, this is the moment
I've been waiting for.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.972
Hey, Dixon, we're gonna
crush you so bad,

01:38.056 --> 01:40.975
they'll have to
use dental records

01:41.059 --> 01:42.185
to identify your body.
- Whoa, there.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.187
That's a little aggressive,
don't you think, Newt?

01:44.270 --> 01:46.856
- Well, maybe you don't
like "Winner Newt."

01:46.940 --> 01:47.941
But you'd better
get used to it.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.610
Sawyer, you, me,
okay, man, let's bounce.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.862
- BELLA: What?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.989
- Hey, I like Winner Newt.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.950
But I'm also
afraid of him.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.576
- NEWT: Sawyer,
get out here!

01:58.660 --> 02:00.370
- Coming!

02:00.453 --> 02:02.539
- So, uh, what about
you, Bella?

02:02.622 --> 02:03.373
You gonna ask your mom?

02:03.456 --> 02:04.707
- Football isn't
really her thing.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.043
She thinks a quarterback

02:07.126 --> 02:09.878
is the change you get back
from a soda machine.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.048
I'll probably ask
my uncle, too.

02:12.131 --> 02:14.259
- Well, I'm really
looking forward to this game.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.802
And since I don't
have to play,

02:15.885 --> 02:17.387
it's gonna be me,
a food vendor,

02:17.470 --> 02:20.890
and a hot bag of mini-donuts.
[chuckling]

02:20.974 --> 02:23.977
Maybe two hot bags.
[chuckling]

02:24.060 --> 02:27.188
- We have got to get that
man a girlfriend.

02:27.272 --> 02:30.400

{\an8}I need Uncle Dale's
phone number.

03:15.111 --> 03:17.614
{\an8}- Address book?
I'm a modern mom.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.781
{\an8}It's all in my smart phone.

03:18.865 --> 03:19.741
{\an8}Where is my smart phone?

03:19.824 --> 03:22.911
{\an8}I'll get the address book.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.287
{\an8}Why do you need to talk
to Uncle Dale?

03:24.370 --> 03:25.538
{\an8}- I'm gonna ask him to play

03:25.622 --> 03:26.831
{\an8}in the Parent-Kid
flag football game.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.208
{\an8}- Hey, I'm your parent.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.168
{\an8}Why don't you play
with me, instead?

03:30.251 --> 03:32.462
- Oh, I didn't think
you'd be interested.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.173
- Since you joined the team,
I've been getting more into it.

03:35.256 --> 03:39.135
I even read "The Moron's
Guide to Football."

03:39.218 --> 03:41.804
The name is insulting,
but it is very educational.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.973
Come on, quiz me.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.309
- Okay, how many points
is a touchdown?

03:46.392 --> 03:48.728
- Six and then you can have
one of those kicky guys

03:48.811 --> 03:51.147
kick it for a point

03:51.230 --> 03:54.108
or one of those little speedy
guys run it in for two.

03:54.192 --> 03:57.236
- Okay, you did say "kicky guy,"
but I'll allow it.

03:57.320 --> 03:57.987
- Well, can I play?

03:58.071 --> 04:00.657
- Yeah, let's do
this thing.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.574
- I just have one thought.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.993
What if we played
with the other team,

04:04.077 --> 04:05.703
instead of against them?

04:05.787 --> 04:08.081
That way, we'd all win.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.166
- Mom, no.

04:10.249 --> 04:12.502
- Okay, well, what if every
down was a first down?

04:12.585 --> 04:14.545
- No.

04:14.629 --> 04:15.463
- What if you got more
points for team spirit?

04:15.546 --> 04:18.507
- Yeah, I'll talk
to Coach about that.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.515
- So, I was thinking,

04:25.598 --> 04:26.975
for the cheer booth at
the game, we could sell...

04:27.058 --> 04:31.020
drum roll...
[imitating drumming]

04:31.104 --> 04:34.315
...your mom's tamales!

04:34.399 --> 04:38.319
- First, what kinda
drums are those?

04:38.403 --> 04:41.447
And second, my mom would
never reveal her recipe.

04:41.531 --> 04:48.538
- "A," they're clearly bongos
and, "B," maybe she will.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.915
- That recipe's
a closely-guarded secret--

04:50.999 --> 04:53.251
like her age,
her real hair color,

04:53.334 --> 04:55.211
and what really happened
to our hamster.

04:55.294 --> 04:59.966
Hamsters don't just pack
up and move away.

05:00.049 --> 05:01.759
- Hola.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.637
- Just ask her nicely.
Try opening with a compliment.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.223
You need to turn to it.

05:07.306 --> 05:08.850
- Mom, your hair
looks great.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.977
What'd you put in it?

05:11.060 --> 05:13.980
- What do you want?

05:14.063 --> 05:15.565
- Actually, Pepper
and I love your tamales,

05:15.648 --> 05:20.069
and were hoping you'd share your
secret tamale recipe with us.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.239
- I'm glad you
like my tamales.

05:23.322 --> 05:24.866
- So, you'll give
us the recipe?

05:24.949 --> 05:27.243
- No.
- Please!

05:27.326 --> 05:28.411
We wanna make them
for a cheer fundraiser

05:28.494 --> 05:29.579
and we swear not to
tell anyone.

05:29.662 --> 05:34.584
By the way, did I mention
how much I love your shoes?

05:34.667 --> 05:36.836
- Well, mija. No.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.963
- Ohhhh...

05:39.047 --> 05:42.383
- I won't give you my recipe,
but I will make them for you.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.969
And it's here to do
with you outta my way.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.597
- Really? Thanks, Mom.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.600
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.268
- Are you sure you
don't need any help?

05:52.351 --> 05:57.857
I'm guessing
the answer is, uh, "no."

05:57.940 --> 05:59.525
- Sí.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.073
- Mr. Huggins,
this is my dad, Vance.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.115
He played
quarterback at Yale.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.118
- Started all four years.

06:09.202 --> 06:09.827
- Pleasure to meet
you, Vance.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.370
Name's Cleveland.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.624
'Course all my old teammates
call me "Stucky."

06:14.707 --> 06:15.875
- Why's that?

06:15.958 --> 06:19.796
- 'Cause every pass they threw
would stick to my hands.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.589
- Would it make more sense
to call you "Sticky"?

06:21.672 --> 06:23.257
- Yeah, but the team already
had another Sticky,

06:23.341 --> 06:27.512
and you do not wanna
be Sticky #2.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.180
- Sticky, Stucky, who cares?

06:29.263 --> 06:30.306
Can we just stop
with the stories.

06:30.389 --> 06:31.516
We need to practice.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.143
- Easy, Newt.
It's just a game.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.187
- Sorry. I just really
wanna beat Troy.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.064
I'm also feeling
a lot of pressure.

06:38.147 --> 06:40.066
Brenda accidentally
shrunk my undies.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.317
- Been there, son.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.527
- Hey, don't worry.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.988
Troy and his nerd uncle
are no match for us.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.698
- That's right.
Check this out.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.785
Think he can handle a pass
from my golden slingshot?

06:50.868 --> 06:53.329
- [laughing]

06:53.412 --> 06:54.539
Does a heifer's tail
pull south on a full moon?

06:58.709 --> 07:00.837
- That means "yes."
Yes, he can.

07:00.920 --> 07:01.838
[chuckles]

07:01.921 --> 07:05.091
Oh, man, our team's
looking pretty good.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.384
- Yeah.
[laughs]

07:06.467 --> 07:08.010
Oh, hey, Troy.
Where's your uncle?

07:08.094 --> 07:09.387
- Running late.
But it's okay.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.638
He doesn't need
too much practice.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.391
Besides, the game's
just for fun.

07:15.476 --> 07:16.894
- Troy's up to something.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.188
I mean, when has he ever
said a game was just for fun?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.065
He always has to win.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.400
- Yeah, when we were kids,

07:22.483 --> 07:25.903
he refused to play "Simon Says"
unless we called it "Troy Says."

07:25.987 --> 07:29.490
And he never let
me be "Troy."

07:29.574 --> 07:31.909
- Okay, this is slightly
different than normal football.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.871
Instead of tackling,
you rip off one of these flags.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.540
- Oh! That was easy.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.959
- The other team's
flags, Mom.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.419
You just tackled yourself.

07:41.502 --> 07:42.503
- You'd think in "The Moron's
Guide to Football"

07:42.587 --> 07:45.214
they'd have a section
on flag football.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.383
[laughing]
Morons.

07:47.466 --> 07:50.178
- Okay, let's work
on your catching.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.179
Do you remember how
to run a button hook?

07:51.262 --> 07:54.765
- Of course, I do.
It is such a cute name.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.518
- Set! Hike!

08:01.022 --> 08:05.067

08:05.151 --> 08:06.694

08:08.279 --> 08:10.323
- Hey, she's just learning.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.158
That's okay, Mom.
We'll get it.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.868
Let's...let's go again.

08:13.951 --> 08:17.079
Okay...

08:17.163 --> 08:19.832
Set! Hike!

08:21.375 --> 08:25.338
- Ow! [gasping]
You throw so fast!

08:25.421 --> 08:27.798
- BOYS: [laughing]

08:27.882 --> 08:30.426

- Uncle Milton,
you made it.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.451
- Hey, Bud.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.245
- Here, let me
help you with those.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.330

Water's over here,

09:04.377 --> 09:05.503
- TROY: Thanks, Coach.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.546
Uh, so, are you ready
to start practice?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.966
- Hey, Buddy, I'm sorry.
That was work.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.884
