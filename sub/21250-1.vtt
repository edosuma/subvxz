<i>Liv...</i>

00:16.649 --> 00:18.417
<i>Liv, wake up.</i>

01:11.571 --> 01:13.238
Come on! Hurry!

01:17.544 --> 01:19.778
Hurry!
Let's go! Almost there!

01:19.780 --> 01:21.046
Don't look down.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.481
Look at me, look at me.

01:33.226 --> 01:34.860
Come on. Keep coming.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.796
It's okay, it's okay.
There you go. Grab my hand.

01:40.633 --> 01:42.034
I got you.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.635
Oh, hello, miss grey.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.470
Hi.
How are you?

02:51.472 --> 02:52.704
Well, thank you.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.173
Sorry to
keep you waiting.

02:54.175 --> 02:55.641
Oh. No.
Not a problem at all, sir.

02:55.643 --> 02:58.610
Listen, I wanted
to tell you myself

02:58.612 --> 03:01.880
that you have the highest
consistent gpa of your class

03:01.882 --> 03:04.349
which means, at this rate,

03:04.351 --> 03:06.885
you're going to be the person
to beat for valedictorian.

03:09.289 --> 03:11.323
That's great.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.559
I thought
you'd be more excited.

03:13.561 --> 03:18.163
Oh, I am.
But there is still a whole year left, so...

03:18.165 --> 03:20.699
Where are you thinking
you'll apply for next fall?

03:20.701 --> 03:21.900
Yale.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.735
I've always planned
on going to Yale.

03:23.737 --> 03:27.372
Well, you have a very impressive record,
miss grey.

03:27.374 --> 03:32.511
I think you're gonna have
a lot of wonderful opportunities.

03:32.513 --> 03:36.048
If you like, I've made up
this list of schools

03:36.050 --> 03:38.183
that I think
would be wonderful

03:38.185 --> 03:42.221
for you to consider
along with Yale.

03:42.223 --> 03:45.023
I'm sure if you
set your mind to it,

03:45.025 --> 03:47.659
you could get into
all of them.

03:47.661 --> 03:51.396
<i>At the beginning of every year,
we have endless time.</i>

03:51.398 --> 03:52.698
You're the top of our class.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.865
You should be
celebrating tonight.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.434
I might be.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.070
I don't want to celebrate
something that I might be.

03:58.072 --> 04:00.205
Come on.
It's a Monday. No.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.274
<i>It's like we pretend
that death isn't coming.</i>

04:02.276 --> 04:05.744
<i>I mean, we're all
gonna die, aren't we?</i>

04:05.746 --> 04:08.247
<i>All right. Show of hands.</i>

04:08.249 --> 04:10.449
<i>Who in here
is not going to die?</i>

04:13.386 --> 04:14.519
<i>Anyone?</i>

04:16.589 --> 04:19.391
<i>Death is not something
that we like to think about,</i>

04:19.392 --> 04:22.127
<i>but without death,
we have no context,</i>

04:22.129 --> 04:24.429
<i>and if we have no context,
we have no meaning.</i>

04:24.431 --> 04:26.531
<i>Why are we breathing?</i>

04:26.533 --> 04:28.867
<i>I want you to take
a look around right now.</i>

04:30.403 --> 04:32.771
<i>There's your meaning.</i>

04:32.773 --> 04:36.608
<i>Individually, we cannot create a life
of meaning in the face of history,</i>

04:36.610 --> 04:42.714
<i>but together, your community,
your family, your friends,</i>

04:42.716 --> 04:45.784
<i>you can build a life of
meaning and leave a legacy.</i>

04:45.786 --> 04:47.319
<i>Let us pray.</i>

04:47.321 --> 04:49.288
All right.
Now we're definitely throwing a party.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.756
Oh, my god, shut up!

04:50.758 --> 04:52.557
It's not for you.
It's for the community.

04:52.559 --> 04:54.126
Otherwise my life
is meaningless.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.328
Come on.
My parents aren't home.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.096
My place.
Your face.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.766
Wait, what are you doing
to my sister's face?

05:00.768 --> 05:02.267
I'm throwing it a party.

05:02.269 --> 05:04.636
Brack told her she's
number one in our class.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.838
Hey, don't tell Casey about it, though.
She's gonna be really weird.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.507
All right.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.575
<i>Amen.</i>
- Amen.

05:10.577 --> 05:14.946
<i>And now for a few words from
your senior class president,</i>

05:14.948 --> 05:16.648
<i>Mr. Matthew grey!</i>

05:24.324 --> 05:26.024
Hey.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.593
The party is for you.

05:28.595 --> 05:29.961
I have something special
i want to give you.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.163
<i>Thank you!</i>

05:31.165 --> 05:33.031
Oh, no. What?

05:33.033 --> 05:34.700
<i>Let me hear you make some
noise for our seniors!</i>

05:36.770 --> 05:39.104
You're gonna have to brave a party
on Monday night to find out.

05:58.658 --> 06:00.192
<i>We'll always be together.</i>

06:04.330 --> 06:05.731
<i>So how far did
you run today, baby?</i>

06:06.999 --> 06:09.234
Um, just around
the loop and back.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.802
Did you go to the top?

06:11.504 --> 06:13.739
No.
Why not?

06:13.741 --> 06:16.007
You go to the top,
it's exactly 5 miles.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.709
I used to run it
every morning.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.245
You're young.
You shouldn't have any problem.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.347
My back these days,
won't let me do anything.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.349
And I asked you to stop
making these potatoes.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.650
I'm gaining weight again.

06:25.652 --> 06:26.818
You love them.

06:28.187 --> 06:30.322
I'm sorry your
back's hurting, daddy.

06:35.161 --> 06:38.363
Olivia's gonna be
valedictorian.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.065
Really?
Matt...

06:40.067 --> 06:41.266
What?

06:41.268 --> 06:42.834
Sweetheart, that's amazing.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.202
Why didn't you
say something?

06:44.204 --> 06:46.438
'Cause there's still
a whole year.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.541
Well,
what's gonna change?

06:49.543 --> 06:51.910
Olivia, sweetheart,
you don't have to be so modest.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.546
It's gonna help people
to take you more seriously.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.248
And let's face it,
you're a beautiful girl,

06:56.250 --> 06:58.517
and that's the first thing
and sometimes the only thing

06:58.519 --> 07:00.051
people see
when they look at you.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.286
Just like your mom.

07:03.389 --> 07:05.123
What about you, Matthew?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.025
Are you gonna let your
sister be the smart twin,

07:07.027 --> 07:08.894
or do grades not matter for
the senior class president?

07:08.896 --> 07:10.529
Nah, not really.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.898
All right.
Well, you better stay on track, Mattie boy,

07:12.900 --> 07:14.766
'cause you're going to get
tapped your freshman year.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.268
Tom!
What?

07:17.036 --> 07:18.603
I was.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.872
I barely kept my grades
with that social scene.

07:20.874 --> 07:21.907
Phew!

07:21.909 --> 07:23.608
Ugh!

07:25.711 --> 07:28.046
I don't know.
I feel like i shouldn't have come.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.148
This is the first
night of school.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.718
You're right.
You should go home, study.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.253
We need to wean
Julian off you, anyway.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.555
Shut up.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.594
Listen, Liv,
this is your night, okay?

07:42.596 --> 07:44.996
I'm not gonna drink.
I'll stay sober.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.432
We'll get home early.
Everything will be fine.

07:47.434 --> 07:50.101
You just have to
do one thing for me.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.237
What?
Have fun.

07:55.942 --> 07:57.242
How am I gonna do it?

07:57.244 --> 07:59.444
You just kind of
got to mingle and dance.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.012
No!

08:01.014 --> 08:03.415
How am I ever
gonna be away from you?

08:08.020 --> 08:09.521
I think it's gonna
be all right.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.523
You won't even
think about me.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.657
You won't.

08:14.293 --> 08:16.161
We want to get
the circle going.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.596
Come on, give me a circle.

08:18.966 --> 08:22.334
All right!
Let's go create a legacy.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.277
How you doing, man?
What's up, man?

08:32.279 --> 08:33.611
Come on.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.113
There he is.
Oh, come on now.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.148
What's up, Dave?
What's up?

08:37.150 --> 08:40.784
J! Tie this girl to a seat
and give her a shot

08:40.787 --> 08:42.187
before she changes
her mind.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.389
Hey, where are
your parents?

08:44.391 --> 08:47.192
Now, what is the point of buying
a goddamn houseboat, Cheryl,

08:47.194 --> 08:48.827
if you can't use it?

08:48.829 --> 08:50.562
Lucky.

08:51.163 --> 08:52.664
Here.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.366
Uh, I'm good, man.
I'm good. I shall abstain.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.500
No, Matt. Come on.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.636
Hey, I can
totally drive home.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.704
Ladies, gentlemen!

08:59.706 --> 09:03.475
A moment of your time, please,
to celebrate my wonderful sister.

09:03.477 --> 09:04.709
Oh, my god.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.845
May her reign
of academic glory

09:06.847 --> 09:11.349
actually realize without her
collapsing in total flames of failure.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.184
Liv!

09:13.186 --> 09:15.120
Thanks, bro. Thanks.
Cheers, Liv.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.657
Oh, come on,
all of it.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.525
Oh! Matt!
Shit. Sorry.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.661
Hey, Casey.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.229
How you doing, girl?
Good. How are you?

09:24.231 --> 09:25.830
Good.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.866
Hey. Hey.
Hey, Liv!

09:27.868 --> 09:29.701
Congrats. Matt told me.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.069
Oh, cool.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.173
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool.

09:35.175 --> 09:38.009
Uh... 11:45 at the car, okay?
Don't be late.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.011
Try and have some fun.
Okay.

09:42.448 --> 09:44.716
Hi.
Hi.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.551
Here.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.853
Um... I think I should
probably just stick with one.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.966
Can we just stay in here?

10:00.968 --> 10:03.868
I don't wanna go back out.
It's too loud out there.

10:06.072 --> 10:07.872
Yeah, we can stay in here.

10:12.578 --> 10:15.146
I want my present.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.217
Okay.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.450
Sorry.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.652
It's okay.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.025
Hey.

11:03.796 --> 11:06.164
There are lyrics, i promise.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.035
I know.

11:15.374 --> 11:17.676
Yeah, I hear your point,
but the question is...

11:17.678 --> 11:19.844
Yes?
...Have you read it?

11:19.846 --> 11:21.346
<i>The catcher in the rye?</i>
Uh-huh.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.982
That is offensive.
No, no, no.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.318
I'm not talking about, like,
"hey, I'm 15 and angsty..."

11:27.320 --> 11:29.721
Petrovich.
What up, dude?

11:29.723 --> 11:34.325
I mean, actually read it.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.194
I mean, the last passage

11:36.196 --> 11:37.696
where he's watching his
sister on the merry-go-round.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.831
I mean, come on,
that is just heartbreaking.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.833
It's great.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.002
Did you say great?
Yeah.

11:44.004 --> 11:47.172
Oh, my god.
You heartless wench.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.041
You do not deserve
what's behind this door.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.309
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.809
Shit!

13:02.248 --> 13:03.481
Let's go.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.152
I didn't know
what time it was.

13:08.754 --> 13:09.821
Now.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.807
I keep on banging my head
on this window.

14:02.809 --> 14:06.110
Oh, wait until you get to bed and
close your eyes. You'll be spinning.

14:09.481 --> 14:12.150
I can't believe you.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.686
You were the one
who told me to have fun.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.688
Just... don't.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.723
You left me, anyways.
Don't.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.692
The second we got there to be with Casey.
Liv...

14:20.694 --> 14:22.393
Liv, shut up,
all right?

14:22.395 --> 14:25.163
What is your problem?
You are.

14:25.165 --> 14:28.399
You have something to drink
and you turn into a complete idiot.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.336
What happened, Matt?

14:31.338 --> 14:32.437
Nothing.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.508
He's like family.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.743
It's disgusting.

14:39.345 --> 14:40.478
It's wrong.

14:40.480 --> 14:44.082
You told me
to have fun.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.184
You said it.
Yeah, I did.

14:46.186 --> 14:51.022
I did, and you went out there
and you acted like a drunken slut.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.590
You know what?
It's none of your business.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.659
None of my business?
It's none of your business!

14:54.661 --> 14:56.928
None of my business. I'm your brother!
Of course it's my business!

14:56.930 --> 15:00.265
Yeah, well,
i don't need you to look out for me!

15:03.702 --> 15:04.769
What?

15:07.540 --> 15:09.540
Matt!

15:09.542 --> 15:12.577
<i>Am I gonna die?</i>

15:12.579 --> 15:14.913
<i>It was an accident.</i>

15:14.915 --> 15:16.080
I love you, Matt.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.452
<i>I love you, too.</i>

15:44.443 --> 15:45.610
Hi.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.414
Hi.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.915
Hey.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.317
How are you doing?

15:52.319 --> 15:53.851
I'm okay.
What about you?

15:55.654 --> 15:57.021
Where is she?

16:05.931 --> 16:07.598
I'm gonna go upstairs.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.767
All right,
sweetheart.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.036
Sweetheart. Hi.
Hi.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.606
Here.
Oh, no, thanks...

16:15.608 --> 16:18.676
Have something to eat.
You should.

16:21.447 --> 16:22.513
Thanks.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.733
Olivia?

18:03.615 --> 18:05.149
I brought you some dinner.

18:08.387 --> 18:09.787
Thanks.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.456
<i>I didn't mean to push you.</i>

18:46.492 --> 18:48.192
<i>It was an accident.</i>

18:49.461 --> 18:52.763
They died because
i touched them.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.298
The mom left.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.567
<i>She left them alone.</i>

18:56.569 --> 18:58.603
<i>I didn't want you to see.</i>

18:58.605 --> 18:59.937
Am I gonna die?

18:59.939 --> 19:01.405
You can't die

19:01.407 --> 19:03.674
because we're gonna
die at the same time.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.576
I promise.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.878
Promise me, too.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.780
I promise.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.647
I called you in here
just to check in with you,

19:42.649 --> 19:44.649
to see how you are.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.785
So, how are you?

19:50.489 --> 19:53.558
Um,
it hasn't been the greatest month of my life.

19:55.861 --> 20:00.998
Miss grey,
your brother was an incredible young man.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.035
I can't express to you how
sorry we are for your loss.

20:04.037 --> 20:07.338
For the loss we all felt
from his passing.

20:07.340 --> 20:14.045
But to lose a twin,
it must have been beyond difficult.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.980
I'm sure anyone
could understand

20:15.982 --> 20:20.051
you falling behind a bit
during these times.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.353
Do I not have
the highest grades anymore?

20:22.355 --> 20:26.057
Olivia, this isn't
about your work.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.693
Your teachers have assured
me that you can catch up.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.028
Who does?

20:31.030 --> 20:34.098
You're a very motivated young woman,
aren't you?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.334
I will make it up.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.771
Mr. brack, miss Hayden's
here to see you.

20:40.773 --> 20:44.742
Listen, if there's
anything you need from me,

20:44.744 --> 20:47.612
please, let me know.

21:49.007 --> 21:50.241
<i>Liv...</i>

21:51.810 --> 21:54.712
Liv, wake up.

22:00.619 --> 22:03.220
Matt? Matt!

22:09.127 --> 22:11.462
I missed you so much!
I missed you, too.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.464
Please don't ever
leave me again, okay?

22:13.466 --> 22:15.366
I didn't.

22:15.368 --> 22:16.834
I didn't.
Where were you?

22:16.836 --> 22:18.803
Just hold me, okay?

22:18.805 --> 22:20.838
Just hold me.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.039
Okay.

22:22.808 --> 22:24.475
You left me here.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.845
I wouldn't.
Please, don't.

22:27.847 --> 22:31.215
I'd never leave you.
I'm right here.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.050
Liv, you promise me?

22:34.019 --> 22:35.252
I'm right here.

22:42.994 --> 22:44.395
I love you, Liv.

22:50.168 --> 22:52.069
I love you, too, Matt.

24:17.722 --> 24:18.956
<i>Punnett square,</i>

24:18.958 --> 24:20.958
a diagram that
is used to predict

24:20.960 --> 24:22.960
an outcome of
a breeding experiment.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.931
It is used to determine the
probability of an offspring

24:26.933 --> 24:30.100
having a particular genotype,
such as eyes.

24:30.102 --> 24:34.271
So in this cross,
what would the genotype be?

24:34.273 --> 24:35.639
Liv?

24:37.442 --> 24:38.509
Liv.

24:39.578 --> 24:41.645
What?
The diagram.

24:43.615 --> 24:44.682
Um...

24:46.618 --> 24:47.685
Anyone else?

24:48.653 --> 24:50.187
Casey.

24:50.189 --> 24:52.823
Blue. Their children would
both have blue eyes.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.024
Good.

25:02.801 --> 25:04.368
Son of a bitch!

25:15.313 --> 25:17.781
How'd you always
make it look so easy?

25:20.819 --> 25:23.387
I hated you
so much for that.

25:27.158 --> 25:29.460
Never seemed like you cared.

25:33.198 --> 25:38.168
So it always felt like i had to
care enough for the both of us.

25:38.170 --> 25:42.072
I mean, I feel like i had to
carry around this huge weight.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.251
And now I see
that I wasn't...

26:00.525 --> 26:05.396
We were both carrying it,
so it was easy,

26:05.398 --> 26:08.065
and now that you're gone,
everything is so heavy.

26:15.373 --> 26:17.808
It's too heavy for me
to carry it alone.

26:22.781 --> 26:24.515
I can't be here alone.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.086
I can't be here
without you.

26:30.889 --> 26:32.156
Yes, you can.

26:34.726 --> 26:36.594
But you don't have to.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.801
Want me to help you study?

26:47.439 --> 26:48.505
Yeah?

26:49.741 --> 26:50.808
What is this?

26:52.744 --> 26:53.978
What is this, bio?

26:56.915 --> 27:00.084
All right.
Bio charades.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.052
Come on.
You know the drill.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.655
Sit.

27:04.657 --> 27:05.956
Let me grab this.

27:06.891 --> 27:07.992
Okay.

27:12.964 --> 27:15.265
What are you doing?
Are you serious?

27:15.267 --> 27:17.201
It's rna transcription, duh.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.638
Come on.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.407
One more hour of this and
you will kill it tomorrow.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.317
I promised you.

27:34.285 --> 27:35.719
Didn't I?

27:38.456 --> 27:39.590
Yeah.

27:40.959 --> 27:42.626
Okay.

27:42.628 --> 27:45.629
Here's what we're gonna do.

27:45.631 --> 27:48.699
Pick your words,
and if you get them all right,

27:50.135 --> 27:51.702
we're eating cookie dough!

27:54.205 --> 27:56.140
All right?

27:56.142 --> 28:00.210
But I'm gonna eat some now
'cause, well, I'm starving,

28:00.212 --> 28:04.381
and you're just going to have
to watch me eat it and drool.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.183
All right?
Pick your words.

28:44.189 --> 28:46.090
I miss recess, too.

28:58.436 --> 28:59.937
We don't have to talk.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.914
I don't know.

29:10.916 --> 29:17.087
Right now, honestly, I feel fine.
Talking is fine.

29:17.089 --> 29:23.227
Because it just feels
like he's home sick or...

29:23.229 --> 29:26.764
I don't know, he's, like,
in a different class or...

29:26.766 --> 29:28.766
Like this whole day
is just gonna go by

29:28.768 --> 29:31.568
and I just missed him because
he just went to the bathroom,

29:31.570 --> 29:35.372
and he just turned around the corner from me,
but...

29:35.374 --> 29:38.075
But when I get back home,
he's gonna be sitting right there,

29:38.077 --> 29:39.877
right across
from me at dinner.

29:41.780 --> 29:45.949
Just like every day and every
night that I've ever known.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.185
He's always right there,
right next to me.

29:55.760 --> 29:58.228
How long have you had
that dogtooth necklace?

30:01.099 --> 30:02.599
Uh...

30:02.601 --> 30:04.568
Since I was 10.

30:06.070 --> 30:08.005
It's always
kind of scared me.

30:10.608 --> 30:12.476
Why?

30:12.478 --> 30:14.945
Just 'cause it snapped.

30:14.947 --> 30:17.147
That something you love
so much one morning

30:17.149 --> 30:19.650
could just wake up
and try to kill you.

30:19.652 --> 30:22.519
Ah, he was just old,
i think.

30:22.521 --> 30:26.456
My uncle was sad
when he had to put him down.

30:26.458 --> 30:29.059
You know,
he just wanted something to remember him by.

30:30.295 --> 30:32.629
It's a good thing.
Yeah.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.531
It's always
brought me good luck.

30:42.140 --> 30:45.275
I don't think I've ever
seen you take that off.

30:45.277 --> 30:46.844
Never had a reason to.

30:55.553 --> 30:57.988
Um... I gotta go
to band practice.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.723
Can we keep
doing this, though?

31:00.692 --> 31:02.593
Talking and not talking.

31:04.395 --> 31:05.462
Yeah.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.299
Hey, keep him safe for me.

31:09.301 --> 31:10.400
I will.

31:12.503 --> 31:13.737
Hey...

31:14.706 --> 31:16.406
I still want my present.

31:17.008 --> 31:18.475
Still wants you.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.838
Katie, well done.

31:47.840 --> 31:48.906
Casey.

31:50.508 --> 31:52.209
Work harder next time.

31:52.211 --> 31:53.277
Liv?

31:56.447 --> 31:57.848
Good to have you back.

32:32.317 --> 32:35.085
Look, I'm in the middle
of dinner with my family.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.987
Let me call you back
in an hour.

32:38.489 --> 32:40.257
How was school, sweetheart?

32:40.259 --> 32:42.759
Um, better.
I'm getting caught up.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.161
Well, that's good.

32:45.263 --> 32:46.830
All right. Thanks.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.640
Oh, my god!
I can't believe I forgot.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.342
What?
To buy candy!

32:58.344 --> 32:59.609
Do you still have
some at your desk?

32:59.611 --> 33:01.778
Just ignore them, okay?
They'll go away.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.482
Would you just sit,
please!

33:05.484 --> 33:08.085
I'd like to have dinner
with my family tonight.

33:24.469 --> 33:25.836
Hey, dad?
Mmm-hmm.

33:25.838 --> 33:27.637
Can I go over
to Julian's tonight?

33:27.639 --> 33:30.007
What? Tonight?

33:30.009 --> 33:31.708
It's a school night.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.510
Dad, it's Halloween.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.978
Everybody's out.

33:34.980 --> 33:37.147
I finished all of
my homework for tonight,

33:37.149 --> 33:39.182
and I promise you I'll have much
more time to catch up this weekend.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.685
This isn't like you.
What?

33:41.687 --> 33:43.854
Going to parties.
It's not a party.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.224
She said she's finished
everything, tom.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.192
So what, you're in
on this with her?

33:49.194 --> 33:52.362
I just don't want her
moping in her room anymore.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.298
Really, I don't have to go.
I just wanted to hang out with him.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.634
Look,
if Julian and any of his other friends

33:57.636 --> 33:59.236
wanna come over here
and hang out,

33:59.238 --> 34:00.670
they're more than welcome.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.239
I can't even believe
that his parents

34:02.241 --> 34:03.907
are letting him
throw another party.

34:06.045 --> 34:07.878
Samantha, please, would you just
go get the candy out of my desk?

34:15.521 --> 34:17.721
Trick or treat!

34:24.228 --> 34:25.328
Okay.

34:27.031 --> 34:30.400
But I want you home early.
Understood?

34:30.402 --> 34:31.534
Of course!

34:31.536 --> 34:32.869
Before midnight.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.704
Yes.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.907
Yes, sir. I promise.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.442
Thank you, daddy.

35:13.144 --> 35:14.778
Hey.
- Hey.

35:17.415 --> 35:18.782
You're going?

35:18.784 --> 35:20.183
Yeah. They said yes.

35:21.652 --> 35:23.787
Go. See you in the car
in five minutes.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.055
Okay.
Thanks.

35:40.238 --> 35:42.172
You've worked hard
this week.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.341
Go have fun.

35:46.277 --> 35:48.845
I don't wanna go
in there without you.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.814
You're never without me.

36:17.342 --> 36:18.642
You scared me.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.243
Come dance with me.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.836
Yeah. Just a minute.

37:46.731 --> 37:48.531
Hey.
Hi.

37:48.966 --> 37:50.267
Hey.

37:50.269 --> 37:51.868
Uh, sorry. It's all yours.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.404
Oh, well...
Okay. Here.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.239
I brought you a drink.

37:56.241 --> 37:57.407
Oh.

37:57.409 --> 37:58.708
Thanks.

38:02.813 --> 38:05.248
I put something in it.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.883
I'm just kidding.

38:07.985 --> 38:09.653
It's so loud in here.

38:09.655 --> 38:13.490
Why don't we just go outside
and we can have a smoke.

38:13.492 --> 38:15.625
Um... no, that's okay.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.993
Are you sure?

38:16.995 --> 38:18.662
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm cool. Thanks, though.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.430
Thanks for the drink.
Okay.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.499
See you later.
Yeah.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.800
I was thinking maybe i could
give your present another shot.

39:32.169 --> 39:33.303
Sorry.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.708
You know,
one of these days

39:38.710 --> 39:40.910
we're gonna get to spend more
than just five minutes together.

39:41.579 --> 39:42.912
I know.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.383
I know. Okay? I'm sorry.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.354
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

39:51.356 --> 39:53.823
I just really shouldn't have
come out tonight.

40:00.931 --> 40:02.932
I'm happy
you're taking care of him.

40:15.045 --> 40:17.614
And I really hope
he's taking care of you.

40:26.390 --> 40:27.590
I'm sorry.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.259
I'm sorry,
i really have to go.

40:37.635 --> 40:38.968
I'm sorry.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.904
I'm so sorry
it took so long.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.071
What's wrong? Hey?

40:42.073 --> 40:43.640
I totally took forever.

40:43.642 --> 40:45.642
It's okay. It's okay.
It was stupid. I'm sorry.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.544
It's all right.
Hey. Shh.

40:48.078 --> 40:50.280
Breathe.

40:50.282 --> 40:52.816
Breathe.
It's okay. I'm here.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.184
I'm here.

40:55.085 --> 40:56.653
I'm here.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.696
Your makeup looks
really pretty like that.

41:07.765 --> 41:09.332
Oh, my god!

41:09.334 --> 41:10.433
Oh, Jesus.

41:10.435 --> 41:12.602
No, no, no.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.037
No, no, no. Hey.

41:14.605 --> 41:15.872
Your eyes.

41:24.515 --> 41:25.748
Thanks.

41:29.653 --> 41:32.589
I'm kind of surprised
you stayed out so late

41:32.591 --> 41:34.057
on a school night.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.598
<i>How are you feeling, Olivia?</i>

42:17.835 --> 42:19.235
I'm fine.

42:19.237 --> 42:21.371
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little bit tired.

42:21.373 --> 42:24.574
How are your, uh,
applications coming along?

42:25.743 --> 42:27.176
They're good.

42:27.178 --> 42:29.345
Um, I decided not to do
early decision to Yale,

42:29.347 --> 42:33.216
so that I could apply to all of
the schools that you recommended.

42:33.218 --> 42:34.817
Hmm...

42:34.819 --> 42:41.024
Your, um, teachers tell me
that you're caught up

42:41.026 --> 42:43.126
with all your
assignments and tests.

42:45.597 --> 42:47.897
So, am I back to
being valedictorian?

42:47.899 --> 42:51.768
I'm really impressed
with your dedication, Olivia.

42:51.770 --> 42:53.469
Keep up the good work.

43:07.618 --> 43:09.319
The steak's cold,
Samantha.

43:40.150 --> 43:41.718
I'm gonna go study.

43:54.565 --> 43:56.599
I'm tired.

43:56.601 --> 43:59.135
Come on, Liv.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.837
What are we writing about?

44:03.308 --> 44:07.343
Hey, hey. Do not let him
distract you, okay?

44:07.345 --> 44:09.512
Look, every single
person in the country

44:09.514 --> 44:11.414
our age is
writing one of these.

44:11.416 --> 44:12.949
It's exciting.
How are you gonna make yours different?

44:12.951 --> 44:14.450
I don't know.

44:18.122 --> 44:20.323
Liv, hey.

44:20.325 --> 44:22.191
What? Put it down.
Concentrate.

44:22.193 --> 44:24.293
I am!
No, you're not!

44:24.295 --> 44:25.695
You're sitting there
trying to think

44:25.697 --> 44:26.963
of a funny way
to text him back.

44:26.965 --> 44:29.098
Now put the phone down!

44:30.267 --> 44:31.601
Now tell me...

44:32.803 --> 44:35.872
What are we
gonna write about?

44:35.874 --> 44:37.473
I don't know! Okay?
What are we gonna write about?

44:37.475 --> 44:39.709
What are we gonna write about?
I don't know!

44:45.282 --> 44:46.549
Okay.

44:48.318 --> 44:49.385
All right.

44:50.487 --> 44:51.554
Get up.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.226
Matt.

44:58.295 --> 44:59.362
Get up!

46:44.735 --> 46:45.868
You always wait.

46:47.471 --> 46:51.174
You wait for everyone to
leave before you change.

46:53.277 --> 46:55.077
I'm on my period.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.414
I need to
talk to you.

47:00.984 --> 47:02.318
Okay. About what?

47:02.320 --> 47:03.920
You look sick.

47:07.291 --> 47:09.458
I'm fine.

47:09.460 --> 47:11.661
A lot of people are
worried about you.

47:12.162 --> 47:13.830
Okay.

47:13.832 --> 47:15.932
If you need to talk, then I'd be happy...
I don't.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.369
Okay. Well,
i want to talk.

47:23.974 --> 47:25.374
I lost him, too.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.045
I'm not saying
it's the same thing,

47:29.047 --> 47:32.315
but it would be nice to
be able to talk to you.

47:32.317 --> 47:35.785
Okay. Well,
I'm not really here to make you feel nice!

47:40.123 --> 47:41.190
I'm sorry.

47:51.568 --> 47:53.369
What do you
wanna talk about?

47:54.171 --> 47:55.404
That night.

47:57.341 --> 47:59.709
Did he say
something to you?

48:00.744 --> 48:02.345
Like what?

48:02.347 --> 48:04.647
About me.
About what I said.

48:04.649 --> 48:08.117
Please,
i just need to know.

48:08.819 --> 48:09.886
Please.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.288
Um...

48:13.557 --> 48:15.758
I don't really remember.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.394
Okay. We were
fighting in the car

48:19.529 --> 48:21.163
and then we crashed.

48:22.366 --> 48:23.933
It was my fault.

48:26.169 --> 48:27.737
He was mad at me.

48:28.705 --> 48:31.207
What are you talking about?

48:31.209 --> 48:35.378
We were talking
and flirting,

48:35.380 --> 48:39.282
and I thought it was finally
gonna be the start of something,

48:40.550 --> 48:43.786
and I was just so happy.

48:43.788 --> 48:45.788
Then he went away.

48:45.790 --> 48:48.190
I mean, he was still there,
but he was...

48:49.593 --> 48:51.794
He was somewhere else.

48:53.430 --> 48:55.965
He said it was a mistake.

48:57.701 --> 49:01.404
I mean, you don't
just look at someone

49:01.406 --> 49:05.074
on their knees
and say that to them!

49:05.076 --> 49:09.445
I just wanted to
say something mean.

49:09.447 --> 49:12.915
I just wanted to say
something to hurt him.

49:12.917 --> 49:14.050
What did you say?

49:16.954 --> 49:19.055
I said,
"then go find your sister.

49:19.057 --> 49:20.456
"She's the one you
really want to..."

49:30.801 --> 49:32.168
Let me guess.

49:37.507 --> 49:40.076
Hi.
<i>- Hi.</i>

49:40.078 --> 49:42.611
<i>Um... I was just gonna
leave you a message.</i>

49:42.613 --> 49:43.713
What's up?

49:45.315 --> 49:47.783
<i>I've been calling you.</i>

49:47.785 --> 49:50.953
I know. I'm sorry.
I've just been a little bit sick.

49:50.955 --> 49:53.022
<i>Yeah, everyone is.</i>

49:53.024 --> 49:55.257
<i>I just talked to Casey,
and she can barely get out of bed.</i>

49:57.861 --> 49:59.228
Is she okay?

50:00.464 --> 50:01.697
<i>Yeah.</i>

50:01.699 --> 50:03.532
<i>She said staying home
today helped.</i>

50:04.468 --> 50:06.135
<i>Are you okay?</i>

50:06.137 --> 50:07.203
What?

50:08.171 --> 50:10.039
<i>I said, are you okay?</i>

50:11.608 --> 50:16.012
Casey didn't stay home today.
I saw her in ballet.

50:16.014 --> 50:18.047
<i>I mean,
maybe she went home early,</i>

50:18.049 --> 50:20.149
<i>but she wasn't in
cans this morning.</i>

50:20.151 --> 50:22.084
<i>She told me
she slept all day.</i>

50:26.356 --> 50:27.823
<i>Liv?</i>

50:27.825 --> 50:29.825
Yeah.

50:29.827 --> 50:31.427
<i>Do you want me to come over?</i>

50:34.498 --> 50:37.233
No. You don't want to
come over here.

50:37.235 --> 50:38.901
<i>I mean, you can come here.</i>

50:40.370 --> 50:42.038
<i>I can make you some soup.</i>

50:44.674 --> 50:46.542
<i>Let me take care of you.</i>

50:48.545 --> 50:50.079
Where are you going?

50:52.682 --> 50:55.718
Um, I thought you and dad
were going out to dinner.

50:56.520 --> 50:57.753
He canceled.

50:58.688 --> 50:59.822
Why?

51:05.696 --> 51:08.664
I'm just gonna go
over to Julian's.

51:08.666 --> 51:10.266
He wants my help with calc.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.935
Did you eat?

51:12.937 --> 51:14.937
I left you some pasta.

51:14.939 --> 51:17.273
Mmm-hmm. I did.
It was really good.

51:22.412 --> 51:24.780
Hey, mom. You okay?

51:27.084 --> 51:28.818
I'm fine, baby.

51:31.555 --> 51:33.823
You say hi to
Julian for me, yeah?

51:52.443 --> 51:54.844
Hi.

52:02.253 --> 52:04.286
Yeah, I wanted it
to be nice.

52:04.288 --> 52:05.955
Thanks.
Yeah.

52:06.957 --> 52:08.257
Houseboat?

52:08.259 --> 52:09.758
Yep.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.627
One would think that
i didn't have parents.

52:15.432 --> 52:17.466
You, um...

52:17.468 --> 52:20.002
Have you eaten yet?

52:31.781 --> 52:34.617
It's not a great soup,
but it's really gonna suck if it's cold.

52:34.619 --> 52:37.319
I'm just really not
that hungry these days.

52:41.191 --> 52:42.491
Okay.

52:48.965 --> 52:50.866
You know,
i miss him a lot.

52:52.469 --> 52:54.803
I think about him.

52:54.805 --> 52:56.972
We weren't really
that close anymore,

52:56.974 --> 53:00.409
but I've never
known anyone who's died.

53:04.047 --> 53:05.447
Yeah, me neither.

53:09.219 --> 53:11.320
I guess
that's pretty lucky.

53:11.322 --> 53:12.888
It doesn't feel that lucky.

53:15.225 --> 53:16.559
Liv...

53:18.495 --> 53:21.330
I really miss him.

53:21.332 --> 53:24.133
I can't even begin to
imagine how much you do.

53:25.368 --> 53:27.269
But look,
I'm here for you.

53:28.505 --> 53:30.406
Whatever you need,
i will do it.

53:36.814 --> 53:38.013
Sorry.

53:38.015 --> 53:39.748
No, you're fine.

53:39.750 --> 53:41.584
I think it's trying
to tell you something.

53:41.586 --> 53:44.653
Yeah. I think
i am a little hungry.

53:45.422 --> 53:46.488
Here.

54:06.910 --> 54:08.544
Is it terrible?

54:08.546 --> 54:12.081
No. No,
i mean, it's soup.

54:12.083 --> 54:14.750
No, it's glorified
spaghettios.

54:22.759 --> 54:25.961
I'm so sorry that
i haven't been here more.

54:25.963 --> 54:27.696
No, you're doing great.

54:30.233 --> 54:30.933
I'm really not.

54:34.771 --> 54:39.308
I've been, um, talking
to people differently.

54:42.779 --> 54:44.313
It's like...

54:45.582 --> 54:47.149
It's like there's
some part of me

54:47.151 --> 54:49.652
that can't get close
enough to see them.

54:49.654 --> 54:54.490
So, it makes it
really hard to care.

54:59.629 --> 55:01.030
What about me?

55:03.099 --> 55:04.533
I see you.

55:07.971 --> 55:10.706
It's just that sometimes
there's something in-between.

55:12.942 --> 55:15.110
What?

55:15.112 --> 55:16.945
Is it me?
Sorry.

55:16.947 --> 55:19.114
Oh, hey. Whoa.
What's wrong?

55:19.116 --> 55:20.616
Nothing. I'm so sorry.

55:20.618 --> 55:22.951
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

55:22.953 --> 55:25.654
It's okay.
It's okay. It's fine.

55:27.457 --> 55:28.524
Come here.

55:30.794 --> 55:32.361
Oh, my god.

55:33.163 --> 55:34.697
Sorry.

55:34.699 --> 55:36.465
No, if you don't want to,
it's not a big deal.

55:36.467 --> 55:38.200
No, it's not that.
It's okay.

55:42.305 --> 55:43.872
You are so beautiful.

55:43.874 --> 55:45.808
Do you want me to go, Liv,
so you can be alone?

55:45.810 --> 55:46.975
No.

55:46.977 --> 55:49.311
Yes. You are.

55:49.313 --> 55:52.481
You need to know that because I see
you not taking care of yourself.

55:52.483 --> 55:54.316
Don't let him
distract you, Liv.

55:54.318 --> 55:55.951
What do you mean?

55:55.953 --> 55:58.120
Liv, I'm just...
I'm worried about you.

55:58.122 --> 55:59.688
Oh, now he wants
to look after you.

55:59.690 --> 56:01.056
I'm fine.

56:01.891 --> 56:03.292
I miss him, too.

56:04.828 --> 56:08.664
You will not use me
to get in my sister's pants.

56:08.666 --> 56:10.566
Can we please
not talk about him?

56:10.568 --> 56:12.401
He's gonna go to college.

56:12.403 --> 56:14.536
He's gonna meet other girls.

56:14.538 --> 56:18.374
Smarter, prettier girls who aren't
messed up in the head like you.

56:18.376 --> 56:19.508
What happens next year?

56:19.510 --> 56:20.843
He's gonna leave you, Liv.

56:20.845 --> 56:22.878
What do you mean?
When you leave.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.446
Liv...

56:25.915 --> 56:27.015
I...

56:27.017 --> 56:29.017
I like you.

56:29.019 --> 56:31.186
All right.
I've liked you for as long as i can remember.

56:31.188 --> 56:32.521
He's gonna hurt you, Liv.

56:32.523 --> 56:33.856
He's gonna hurt you.
I know it.

56:33.858 --> 56:35.324
I just don't
want it to hurt.

56:35.326 --> 56:37.259
No, I would never hurt you.

56:37.261 --> 56:39.395
I'll never leave you
because I love you.

56:39.397 --> 56:41.296
Liv, I love you.

56:50.039 --> 56:51.507
I want you.

56:53.677 --> 56:55.344
Uh... are you sure?

56:55.346 --> 56:56.912
Yes.

56:56.914 --> 56:58.514
Okay. Okay.

56:58.516 --> 57:00.182
Uh...

57:00.184 --> 57:01.617
Um... uh...

57:01.619 --> 57:03.552
Wait. Wait one second, okay?
Okay.

57:03.554 --> 57:04.620
Shit!

57:09.626 --> 57:11.193
You shouldn't
be here for this.

57:11.195 --> 57:13.195
Where do you want me to go?
Please, not for this.

57:13.197 --> 57:15.097
Just go away, just for a little while.
Liv. Liv, listen,

57:15.099 --> 57:17.433
you can't just pick and choose when
you want me to be around, okay?

57:17.435 --> 57:18.934
That's not how it works!

57:18.936 --> 57:19.968
Please just go away.
Just for a little while.

57:19.970 --> 57:21.303
No!
Matt!

57:25.408 --> 57:28.043
Do you really need
his love that bad?

57:31.815 --> 57:32.981
Weird.

57:36.619 --> 57:39.822
Let's see how long you can
last without me this time.

59:02.472 --> 59:03.505
Matt!

59:13.049 --> 59:15.050
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean...

59:16.686 --> 59:20.889
Um... I think, uh,
maybe you should go.

59:20.891 --> 59:22.558
Please, please.
Let me just...

59:22.560 --> 59:24.393
Okay. No, you need help!

59:25.528 --> 59:27.930
Julian.

59:27.932 --> 59:32.267
I'm sorry.
I don't know how or what, but you need help.

59:39.008 --> 59:41.376
Look, I know things have been
messed up this past year...

59:41.378 --> 59:42.644
"Messed up"?

59:43.746 --> 59:46.381
This is not my fault.

59:46.383 --> 59:51.286
I can't just pretend that
you saying that is okay.

59:51.288 --> 59:53.922
Okay, but everything else
before that was okay?

59:56.559 --> 59:57.626
Yeah, I...

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:01.964
Liv. Liv!

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:07.636
Get help.

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:09.671
Fuck you!

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:20.482
All right, and I haven't given you a
lot of assignments during the break,

01:00:20.484 --> 01:00:22.918
but please,
do a little bit of reading.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.786
I'm really excited
for all of you.

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:27.589
I know you've all gotten
in your college applications.

01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:30.092
Congrats on that.

01:00:30.094 --> 01:00:31.727
Uh, but definitely
for the people

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:33.996
who are waiting
for early enrollment,

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:35.397
don't freak out.

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:37.132
Enjoy your vacations.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:39.368
Enjoy your families.
Get some good rest.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:50.779
You all have my email,
don't be afraid to use it.

01:00:50.781 --> 01:00:52.481
I'll see you in January.

01:00:52.483 --> 01:00:54.449
Pick up your papers before you go.
Hey, Casey.

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:56.952
Case?
- Bye, everyone.

01:00:56.954 --> 01:00:59.755
Bye, guys. Good job.
I'll see you after the break.

01:00:59.757 --> 01:01:01.990
Olivia.
I'd like to speak to you.

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.863
Good job, guys.
Hey.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.335
This isn't you.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:16.004
Well, my name's on it.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:18.273
You have never
gotten below an a-

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:21.476
on a pop quiz
in my class, ever.

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:24.479
You make everything up.
You come back as yourself, and now this?

01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:26.548
He thinks you don't
work hard enough.

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:28.950
What's going on?

01:01:29.886 --> 01:01:31.119
What?

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:36.024
Are you on something?

01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:39.161
No.

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:41.997
Some of the other teachers have
been expressing their concern.

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:44.833
About my grades?
No, about you.

01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:48.336
What about me?
About you not being yourself.

01:01:48.338 --> 01:01:51.006
You just said that,
so then who am I?

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:53.508
You want to know what I think?
I think that you're overworked.

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:55.711
I think you're
taking on too much.

01:01:55.713 --> 01:01:58.847
Can we go? I'm starving.

01:01:58.849 --> 01:02:00.115
I'll be fine.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:07.089
Can I help you?

01:02:07.091 --> 01:02:09.257
Geez, this again?

01:02:09.259 --> 01:02:10.926
I'm fine, thank you.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:14.996
I'm gonna have to
call your parents.

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.769
Because I got
one bad grade?

01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:23.171
No, because
i think you need help.

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:25.674
Help? With what exactly?

01:02:25.676 --> 01:02:27.876
Studying?
I'm not concerned about your grades.

01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:29.578
I'm really not.
So what is it about?

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.747
Okay.
You keep on telling me that I need help,

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:34.750
so I just need to understand what
exactly I need so much help to do?

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:36.918
I'm concerned
about your health.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.019
Shut up!

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:48.497
I'm not
your enemy here, Liv.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.000
He is.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:56.772
You know what?

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:58.974
Fine.

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:01.309
Call them.

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:04.880
Why don't you
tell them that,

01:03:04.882 --> 01:03:06.414
with everything else that's
gonna suck this Christmas,

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:08.550
they need to worry about
the academic standing

01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:11.987
of their remaining child.

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:16.191
'Cause I really think my family
needs one more thing to grieve for.

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:22.531
Liv.

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:57.232
<i>You promised me, Liv.</i>

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:02.571
<i>You promised me.</i>

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:10.545
What the hell
are you doing?

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:15.383
Hey?

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.588
Sorry.

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.225
Are you okay?

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:35.370
We did it.

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:51.519
<i>...to take your call.</i>

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:53.388
<i>Please leave a message
and we'll get back to you.</i>

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.390
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:56.725
<i>Hi.</i>

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:59.227
<i>Uh, Craig Donovan
calling again.</i>

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:02.931
<i>I'm not sure if you've seen
my other message, but...</i>

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:04.900
<i>I understand the holidays
are a busy time,</i>

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:08.169
<i>but I'd really like to speak
with you about Olivia.</i>

01:05:09.773 --> 01:05:11.239
<i>You can reach me any time
on my personal cell,</i>

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:14.910
<i>619-178-1974. Thank you.</i>

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:29.291
<i>Message erased.</i>

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:51.840
This is the '59.

01:06:51.842 --> 01:06:53.808
It's pretty darn good.

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:56.144
Livvy! Come on
in here, sweetheart.

01:06:56.146 --> 01:06:57.946
Say hello
to Harvey and Kate.

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:03.184
Hi.

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:05.186
Merry Christmas, gorgeous.

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:07.489
Well, you certainly
made good on the buffet.

01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:09.991
She's like me.
Beanpole till I was 30.

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:12.127
I can't
eat like that anymore.

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:14.195
Tell them what
you did today, sweetheart.

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.530
Dad...

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:16.898
She applied
to 20 schools.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.733
All the ivies,
plus the sister schools,

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:20.735
and probably a whole bunch
more i have no idea about.

01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:23.071
But Yale is the only one she
really cares about. Right, baby?

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:25.173
Skinny minnie is
pulling her weight.

01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:26.574
Well, don't forget
about dessert, sweetheart.

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.510
I brought four pies,
plus ice cream that,

01:07:28.512 --> 01:07:30.345
lord knows,
we don't need to be eating.

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:31.980
I forgot about them.

01:07:31.982 --> 01:07:33.448
I'll just go put them out.

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.418
Whole foods.

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:49.397
Hello.

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.868
Yeah, hello, Mr. Donovan.

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:57.238
Hey, it's time to celebrate.

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.140
Come here.

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.677
Come out.

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:07.549
You did it, Liv.

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:09.551
You proved them all wrong.

01:08:09.553 --> 01:08:12.654
And now you're gonna
prove it to yourself.

01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:14.622
Okay.

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:17.959
Sit.

01:08:21.397 --> 01:08:22.663
Sit.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.634
Hey, it's okay.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:34.242
Matt, Matt, Matt...

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.477
Hey. Liv, Liv, I got you.

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:37.879
It's okay.
I've got you.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:40.682
Okay?

01:08:42.384 --> 01:08:43.852
It's okay.

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:48.223
I got you, it's okay.
You're okay, you're okay.

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.163
Okay?

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.133
Yeah.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.469
Feels good, right?
Yeah.

01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:03.872
I'm proud of you.

01:09:07.408 --> 01:09:10.845
Told you we'd get out
of here. Didn't I?

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:17.152
Come on.
Matt, what are you doing?

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:19.654
It's okay.
Matt, no, please!

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.622
Hey. Please,
don't make me do this!

01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:24.359
Hey, hey.
Hey, it's okay.

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.362
Relax.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:35.203
This isn't
going away, Liv.

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:38.540
It's not gonna end after graduation,
all right?

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:40.274
Do you think dad's
just suddenly gonna go

01:09:40.277 --> 01:09:41.475
let you do
whatever you want?

01:09:41.478 --> 01:09:43.211
He's not. Okay?

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:46.648
You're going to his school,
you're taking over his firm,

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.416
just like
he wanted me to do.

01:09:51.153 --> 01:09:52.819
Hey.

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:54.556
They're never
gonna love you.

01:09:57.861 --> 01:09:59.227
Not like I do.

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.797
Not like I do.

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:07.035
Hey. Hey, look at me.

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:09.704
Hey. It's okay.

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:12.874
It's okay.

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:22.517
Liv?

01:10:22.519 --> 01:10:24.352
That's it,
i got you.

01:10:24.354 --> 01:10:25.753
I got you.

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:27.989
Okay?

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:31.025
I got you.

01:10:31.027 --> 01:10:32.493
I just wanted you
to feel free.

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.769
I love you.
- I love you.

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:43.771
Will it hurt?

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.775
Nothing's ever
gonna hurt again.

01:10:49.044 --> 01:10:50.712
You have to do this, Liv.

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:51.746
You promised me.

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:53.081
Tom!

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:41.663
She'll be okay, won't she?

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:45.133
You never
cared about her.

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:46.601
You've never even cared
what she wants in life...

01:11:46.603 --> 01:11:48.069
Mom!

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:49.771
What's it about?
It's about control.

01:11:49.773 --> 01:11:52.140
Daddy!

01:11:52.142 --> 01:11:53.908
Please!
What are you... no!

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:55.176
Hold her arm,
hold her arm! Steady.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:04.552
Matt!

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.588
Matt!

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:18.933
Please, don't leave me.

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:33.181
Mealtime.

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:40.355
If you miss a meal, Olivia,

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:42.190
you have to drink
a replacement shake.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.794
I can't move.

01:12:46.796 --> 01:12:48.296
It's your meds.

01:12:48.298 --> 01:12:49.997
I drooled through
my first three weeks here.

01:12:49.999 --> 01:12:52.066
You just have to
force yourself to sit up.

01:12:52.068 --> 01:12:53.568
Your body will normalize.

01:12:57.806 --> 01:13:00.441
<i>You don't even exist to me!</i>

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:03.044
<i>You don't even exist.</i>

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:06.414
<i>You are nothing.</i>

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:09.417
<i>You are shit!</i>

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:10.985
Betsey,
what do you have?

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:14.088
Nothing.

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:17.658
May I see it?

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:18.960
It's a book.

01:13:21.363 --> 01:13:23.531
Betsey?
No, it's mine.

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:25.867
Betsey.
This is healthy. Okay?

01:13:25.869 --> 01:13:28.936
I'm not reading about
calories or recipes.

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:30.571
I'm not looking at models.

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:32.039
It's a health magazine.

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:33.274
It's a trigger.

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:35.443
Everything is
a goddamn trigger!

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:58.766
Do you remember the first time
you restricted food, Olivia?

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.235
I what?
- Sweetheart,

01:14:01.237 --> 01:14:03.304
we hardly ever
see you eat anymore.

01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:06.107
I eat.

01:14:06.109 --> 01:14:10.111
Fruit, and just
part of your dinner.

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:11.879
I eat at school.

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:13.881
You've got to put some meat
on those bones, little girl.

01:14:13.883 --> 01:14:16.451
Yeah.
Daddy's orders, little girl.

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.389
Okay.

01:14:21.391 --> 01:14:24.258
I understand that I do
need to put on weight.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.161
Um, so how much weight do I have
to put on before I can go home?

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:30.898
Have you been feeling particularly
stressed or anxious this past year?

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:37.572
<i>Mealtime, Olivia.</i>

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:53.354
Don't. I need that.

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:00.394
I'm not that hungry
right now.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:06.501
Are you sure?
Yeah.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.571
Oh, can I just
eat it in my room?

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.541
I'll get you a shake.

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:28.756
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:35.396
Matt...

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:40.535
I'm sorry.
Shut up.

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:51.679
I don't wanna be
here either, you know,

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:53.481
but at least
we're in here together.

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:00.988
Here...

01:16:03.025 --> 01:16:05.359
Come on, have this.
I'm not hungry.

01:16:05.361 --> 01:16:07.728
I told you
to shut up, Liv!

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:11.766
I do not wanna hear your voice!
Do you understand?

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:13.668
We could have been
out of here, okay?

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:18.005
This is your fault!
You're the reason I'm here!

01:16:18.007 --> 01:16:20.508
We had a chance to be free,
and you couldn't take it.

01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:22.143
You were too scared.

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:25.913
Now we're here.

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.749
Are you finished, Olivia?

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:30.151
Get out!

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:34.589
Refusing to take meals
and refusing shakes

01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:36.891
forces us to administer
enteral feedings.

01:16:36.893 --> 01:16:38.192
I'll drink it!

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:39.727
You were given
that option, Olivia.

01:16:39.729 --> 01:16:40.962
What?

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:42.463
I said I'll drink it!

01:16:42.465 --> 01:16:44.699
You did this to yourself.

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:55.676
You did this to yourself.

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:07.388
This is your session,
Olivia.

01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:09.991
We don't have to talk
if you don't want to.

01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:13.060
This place is insane.

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:15.329
Why?

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.066
I told her I would eat.

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:21.268
And then you didn't.

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:25.706
Well, the meds that you're having
me take make me feel sick.

01:17:27.275 --> 01:17:29.276
Then, perhaps you should
get food enterally

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:31.045
until you don't
feel sick anymore.

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:35.750
You haven't eaten
normally in months.

01:17:35.752 --> 01:17:38.319
You might not
feel hungry anymore.

01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:41.222
Well, I get hungry.
I just...

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.459
What?

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:47.261
What happens
when you get hungry?

01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:50.264
I was very busy
this year.

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:52.867
I had a lot of work to do,
so I just forgot.

01:17:52.869 --> 01:17:54.135
You forgot to eat?

01:17:54.137 --> 01:17:56.971
Mmm.

01:17:56.973 --> 01:18:00.775
You and your brother did a lot of the
same things together, didn't you?

01:18:00.777 --> 01:18:03.511
You shared the same friends,
similar schedules.

01:18:03.513 --> 01:18:04.945
Yeah.
Shared a car?

01:18:04.947 --> 01:18:07.982
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:10.184
After he passed,
it must have been difficult

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:12.820
to engage in
those things alone.

01:18:12.822 --> 01:18:16.791
Are you asking me if after the
accident things were difficult?

01:18:16.793 --> 01:18:20.494
I'm asking how did you do everything
you did before with Matt, alone?

01:18:20.496 --> 01:18:21.896
I just did it.

01:18:28.337 --> 01:18:30.671
He even smells
like bullshit.

01:18:31.741 --> 01:18:33.507
Is there something funny?

01:18:33.509 --> 01:18:36.711
No. Nothing's
funny anymore.

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.684
Do you remember
when you became so busy

01:18:43.686 --> 01:18:45.519
that you started
to forget to eat?

01:18:45.521 --> 01:18:47.855
I didn't always forget.

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:49.757
When you started
to restrict.

01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:51.926
I didn't restrict!

01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:53.661
But you hid food,
didn't you?

01:18:53.663 --> 01:18:55.262
Food that you told your
family you were eating?

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:58.265
You hid it behind a tree.

01:18:58.267 --> 01:19:00.568
A tree that was very important
to you and your brother.

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:02.536
He thinks he knows
our story, Liv.

01:19:02.538 --> 01:19:04.572
Were you hiding the food so
that you didn't have to eat it?

01:19:04.574 --> 01:19:05.706
No.
Don't even bother.

01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:07.441
Then why hide the food?

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:09.376
I hid the food...
Get us out of here!

01:19:09.378 --> 01:19:11.512
Was there a reason
you started hiding it?

01:19:11.514 --> 01:19:16.083
A voice that
told you not to eat?

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:17.952
What's he talking...
What?

01:19:17.954 --> 01:19:20.287
Is there a voice that tells
you or tells you not to eat?

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:22.790
No.

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:24.091
Is there a voice that tells
you to do other things?

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:25.559
When to work,
to sleep, to speak?

01:19:25.561 --> 01:19:27.261
Is he kidding?

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.463
Doesn't everyone have a voice
that tells them what to do?

01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:31.532
Right.
Your conscience?

01:19:31.534 --> 01:19:32.767
Does your conscience
tell you not to eat?

01:19:32.769 --> 01:19:34.435
No.
Who does?

01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:36.137
Why are you asking me this?

01:19:36.139 --> 01:19:37.972
Because, often,
people with an eating disorder

01:19:37.974 --> 01:19:41.542
describe a voice in their
head that sounds different.

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:43.043
I don't have
a problem with food.

01:19:43.045 --> 01:19:44.612
This isn't about food,
really.

01:19:44.614 --> 01:19:46.781
Do you find you feel
out of control? Overwhelmed?

01:19:46.783 --> 01:19:50.217
Yeah, I feel stressed
a lot and I feel scared.

01:19:50.219 --> 01:19:51.452
Because of school.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:53.554
No, because of everything.

01:19:53.556 --> 01:19:57.224
Well, when you feel stressed or scared,
what helps you the most?

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:03.264
Liv, I wanna go, Liv.
I wanna go right now.

01:20:03.266 --> 01:20:04.765
I wanna go home.
- Now.

01:20:04.767 --> 01:20:06.267
When can I go home?

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:08.235
When you eat, Olivia.

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:11.438
Okay. Then I will.
I promise you, I will.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.408
I just need to do it
alone in my room, please.

01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:16.844
You have a history
of sabotaging food,

01:20:16.846 --> 01:20:19.647
of either ruining it
or hiding it.

01:20:19.649 --> 01:20:22.750
The way you spilled
the replacement shake.

01:20:22.752 --> 01:20:24.451
We have to make sure
that you're eating, Olivia.

01:20:24.453 --> 01:20:25.653
You're not hungry.

01:20:25.655 --> 01:20:27.254
I'm not that hungry.

01:20:27.256 --> 01:20:28.956
If you don't,
your body will give out.

01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:30.524
He's lying!

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:31.959
But more specifically,
your heart will give out,

01:20:31.961 --> 01:20:33.127
and then you will die.

01:20:33.129 --> 01:20:34.461
He's lying, Liv.

01:20:34.463 --> 01:20:37.398
Slowly,
but horribly and certainly.

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:40.801
Let's go. Now!

01:20:40.803 --> 01:20:42.937
I wanna go back to my room.

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:47.608
You can go if you like.

01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:58.285
You and your brother loved each
other very much, didn't you?

01:20:58.287 --> 01:21:01.222
What do you think he would say
to you if he saw you in here?

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:25.613
What's wrong, Liv?

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.952
Nothing. I love you.

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:46.133
Matt, am I gonna die?

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:51.605
Quiet.

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:33.714
I wanna be that happy.

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:37.651
I just wanted you
to feel free.

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:40.254
Sorry.

01:22:40.256 --> 01:22:41.722
<i>You can't die</i>

01:22:41.724 --> 01:22:43.557
because we're gonna
die at the same time.

01:22:43.559 --> 01:22:44.925
No, we won't.

01:22:44.927 --> 01:22:46.226
<i>Quiet.</i>

01:22:46.228 --> 01:22:47.528
Please, don't tell.

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:50.097
I promise.

01:22:50.099 --> 01:22:51.765
Promise me, too.

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:54.435
I promise.

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.510
Dr. rothstein?

01:23:03.512 --> 01:23:05.946
I know it's early,
but I really do need to talk to you.

01:23:05.948 --> 01:23:07.348
Olivia, what's wrong?

01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:08.716
I'm just scared.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.952
Hey.

01:23:11.954 --> 01:23:13.654
Tell him what he
wants to hear.

01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:15.622
What is it?

01:23:15.624 --> 01:23:17.291
Come on in. Have a seat.

01:23:17.293 --> 01:23:18.859
I can't.

01:23:18.861 --> 01:23:21.495
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can. Just lie.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:25.065
Tell him you'll get better.
You'll put on weight. Anything.

01:23:26.434 --> 01:23:30.404
Just sit down,
and get us out of here.

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:44.385
I don't wanna do this.
- Yes, you do.

01:23:44.387 --> 01:23:47.388
Whatever you wanna say.
- Take your time.

01:23:54.329 --> 01:24:00.167
When I was born,
my brother was with me.

01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:01.835
He was always with me.
What are you doing?

01:24:01.837 --> 01:24:05.005
My whole life,
I've never known anything else.

01:24:05.007 --> 01:24:07.841
And when things
got really bad this year,

01:24:07.843 --> 01:24:10.411
I didn't know how...

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:13.147
I just couldn't.

01:24:13.149 --> 01:24:14.581
When he passed.

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:17.317
Liv,
what are you doing?

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.587
When he passed.

01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:22.189
When he...

01:24:22.191 --> 01:24:24.725
Liv, I'm right here.

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:26.527
Liv, I'm right here! Okay?
I couldn't...

01:24:26.529 --> 01:24:28.162
You promised me, Liv!

01:24:28.164 --> 01:24:29.663
You promised me!

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:34.234
I couldn't...

01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:36.737
I couldn't...

01:24:36.739 --> 01:24:38.172
Breathe, Olivia.

01:24:38.174 --> 01:24:39.440
What? You want me to go?

01:24:39.442 --> 01:24:40.941
Do you want me to go?
No, no, no!

01:24:40.943 --> 01:24:42.242
Please, please!

01:24:42.244 --> 01:24:44.344
Deep breaths.

01:24:44.346 --> 01:24:45.746
Deep breaths, Olivia.

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:49.783
Come on.

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:52.352
When he...

01:24:52.354 --> 01:24:53.454
When he what?

01:24:53.456 --> 01:24:54.888
When he came...

01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:57.591
You are nothing
without me.

01:24:57.593 --> 01:25:00.461
You wanna see how long you can
last without me this time, huh?

01:25:00.463 --> 01:25:02.296
Olivia, you can do this.
You're strong.

01:25:02.298 --> 01:25:03.997
You are weak
without me!

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:06.600
When Matt died...

01:25:06.602 --> 01:25:07.901
You promised me, Liv!
What are you doing?

01:25:07.903 --> 01:25:09.069
When Matt died...

01:25:09.071 --> 01:25:10.404
What are you doing?

01:25:10.406 --> 01:25:11.939
What are you doing
right now?

01:25:11.941 --> 01:25:14.074
We promised that we would
die together, and I didn't.

01:25:14.076 --> 01:25:15.242
That's not your fault.

01:25:15.244 --> 01:25:16.643
That's your fault.

01:25:16.645 --> 01:25:17.911
And I begged for him
to come back to me.

01:25:17.913 --> 01:25:19.713
I did.
And I thought that he did.

01:25:19.715 --> 01:25:21.048
And I did.

01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:22.249
I thought that he
came back for me.

01:25:22.251 --> 01:25:24.451
Liv, I did
come back for you.

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:26.920
I'm right here.
Look at me!

01:25:26.922 --> 01:25:28.489
How can you
do this to me?

01:25:28.491 --> 01:25:30.958
I've been right here
by your side the whole time.

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:37.064
I hate you.

01:25:37.066 --> 01:25:39.166
I don't love you anymore.

01:25:39.168 --> 01:25:42.769
I never did love you.
I made up the whole thing.

01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:44.638
You're nothing without me.

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:47.841
So come with me.

01:25:48.843 --> 01:25:50.177
I'm taking you with me.

01:25:50.179 --> 01:25:51.512
No, you're not!

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:56.350
You're not!

01:25:56.352 --> 01:25:58.685
Because you're not
my brother.

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.760
You're not my brother.

01:26:19.807 --> 01:26:21.441
You're okay.

01:26:23.945 --> 01:26:25.279
It's okay.

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:37.157
<i>When you come
into the world with someone,</i>

01:26:37.159 --> 01:26:40.227
<i>everything you've ever seen,</i>

01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:43.964
<i>everything you've
ever touched or smelled</i>

01:26:43.966 --> 01:26:47.334
<i>is with them by your side.</i>

01:26:47.336 --> 01:26:50.737
<i>And a world without them
doesn't even seem possible.</i>

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:57.044
<i>When he left this world,
I made up a new one.</i>

01:26:57.046 --> 01:26:59.846
<i>One where I could see him.</i>

01:26:59.848 --> 01:27:04.518
<i>First, in dreams,
and then when I was awake.</i>

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:07.921
<i>The more time that
I spent in our world,</i>

01:27:07.923 --> 01:27:12.693
<i>the more I could feel myself
slipping away from this one.</i>

01:27:12.695 --> 01:27:15.762
Do you think that's what
he would have wanted?

01:27:15.764 --> 01:27:19.399
No, Matt wouldn't
have wanted me to die.

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:23.437
He would have
wanted me to live, a lot.

01:27:23.439 --> 01:27:28.041
He would have wanted me
to have fun and to grow up,

01:27:28.043 --> 01:27:32.512
see new things,
fall in love.

01:27:32.514 --> 01:27:36.617
But that voice wasn't Matt.

01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:39.152
I know that.

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:43.890
You have lunch out today.

01:27:43.892 --> 01:27:45.859
Yeah.

01:27:45.861 --> 01:27:48.562
Take deep breaths.

01:27:48.564 --> 01:27:52.866
And just remember, health is a choice,
and you can make it.

01:27:58.072 --> 01:27:59.606
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah.

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:02.709
I'm just looking for him.

01:28:02.711 --> 01:28:04.011
Great.

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:09.983
Hi.
Hi.

01:28:17.126 --> 01:28:18.458
I missed him.

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:19.826
Yeah, he missed you.

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:22.629
Hey. So, um...

01:28:23.831 --> 01:28:27.234
I'm sorry that
i didn't visit.

01:28:27.236 --> 01:28:28.635
You know, it just
kind of seemed like...

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:30.170
No, I didn't want you to.

01:28:30.172 --> 01:28:32.205
I didn't want you
to see me like that.

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:38.312
Hey, what can I get you?
Hi.

01:28:40.415 --> 01:28:41.982
Um...

01:28:41.984 --> 01:28:44.184
You go first.
Okay.

01:28:44.186 --> 01:28:49.423
I'm gonna do the deluxe
burger with cheddar.

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:51.925
And for you?

01:28:51.927 --> 01:28:54.261
Mmm...

01:28:54.263 --> 01:28:58.298
Just, I think a salad
with some mixed Greens.

01:28:58.300 --> 01:28:59.833
Anything on top?
Chicken, quinoa?

01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:01.268
No. Thanks.

01:29:04.872 --> 01:29:07.007
Thanks. Hey, actually,
could we get onion rings to start?

01:29:07.009 --> 01:29:08.675
Sure.
Thank you.

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:11.712
Sorry.

01:29:11.714 --> 01:29:14.648
They just make me eat so much I
just really wanna have a salad

01:29:14.650 --> 01:29:17.551
and to not have to drink
the dressing in the end.

01:29:17.553 --> 01:29:19.453
They make you
drink dressing?

01:29:19.455 --> 01:29:22.055
Well,
everything is portioned out for weight gain.

01:29:22.057 --> 01:29:24.491
So if you have
anything left over,

01:29:24.493 --> 01:29:27.227
then you
kind of have to...

01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:29.796
I'm sorry,
we don't really have to talk about this.

01:29:29.798 --> 01:29:32.332
Okay.

01:29:32.334 --> 01:29:35.369
Seriously, if I was still bad,
i would have ordered everything that you did

01:29:35.371 --> 01:29:37.003
and then I would have
shoved it under my dress

01:29:37.005 --> 01:29:39.039
and probably when you went
to the bathroom,

01:29:39.041 --> 01:29:40.440
I might have, like,
found a tree outside to go plant it under.

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:44.711
It's okay.
You can laugh.

01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:53.086
So do you...

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:56.223
I don't know,
do you still...

01:29:56.924 --> 01:29:58.425
Not really.

01:29:58.427 --> 01:30:01.495
Um, I just feel him.

01:30:01.497 --> 01:30:06.733
Like, right before i go to bed or
right when I'm about to turn a corner.

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:10.170
But I think
that's probably just...

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.775
Phantom twin syndrome.

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:18.578
Well, you know what,

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:20.380
I think it's good
that you don't.

01:30:20.382 --> 01:30:24.117
I mean,
not that it's good that you don't, but...

01:30:24.119 --> 01:30:26.253
I don't know,
i think it's...

01:30:26.255 --> 01:30:28.188
I think it's good
that you're here.

01:30:29.123 --> 01:30:30.190
Yeah.

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:33.193
I am here.

01:30:36.297 --> 01:30:39.800
Hey, I, um...
I brought my guitar,

01:30:39.802 --> 01:30:41.701
if you wanna sit
in the park, after.

01:30:41.703 --> 01:30:43.570
That sounds nice.

01:30:43.572 --> 01:30:45.038
I might even
play you my song.

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.973
Whoa!
It's been a long time coming.

01:30:46.975 --> 01:30:49.776
I don't think i could handle it.
It would be too much!

01:30:50.979 --> 01:30:52.245
Onion rings to start.

01:30:52.247 --> 01:30:53.413
Thank you.

01:30:53.415 --> 01:30:55.081
And a mixed Greens salad.

01:30:55.083 --> 01:30:56.983
Your burger will be
out in a second.

01:30:56.985 --> 01:30:58.752
Can I get you
anything else?

01:30:58.754 --> 01:31:00.687
Uh, no,
i think we're good.

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:09.996
Hey?

01:31:11.466 --> 01:31:13.066
Hey.

01:31:14.269 --> 01:31:16.303
If this is too much,
we can go.

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:19.506
No.

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:29.249
I'm fine.
