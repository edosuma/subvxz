It's momentos
from our relationship.

20:42.843 --> 20:46.444
Like the superglue you used
to fix my ed hardy sandal

20:46.446 --> 20:48.513
At the gathering
of the juggalos.

20:48.515 --> 20:51.316
And now
I want to add this.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.852
Why don't you do it?

20:53.854 --> 20:55.988
You found me, stan!
Your turn!

20:55.990 --> 20:58.923
199, 198...

20:58.925 --> 21:00.793
Bye!
Have a great time!
