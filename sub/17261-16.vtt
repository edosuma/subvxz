{\an5}(male TV announcer)
The Cincinnati Bengals
are at their own one-yard line,

00:09.342 --> 00:12.220
and barring a miracle, this game
belongs to the Cleveland Browns.

00:12.303 --> 00:15.765
Well, that must make
you happy, huh, Elka?

with the mayor of Cincinnati.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.311
{\an1}She bet him
that if Cleveland wins,

00:20.395 --> 00:22.439
{\an1}he has to wear
the Browns mascot costume

00:22.522 --> 00:26.276
{\an1}for a week
and dress like a dog.

00:26.359 --> 00:31.906
I hope that costume
won't be too ruff on you.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.789
You kiss your mom that way?

01:20.872 --> 01:22.665
No, it's just that you're
wearing the same perfume

01:22.749 --> 01:23.792

01:23.875 --> 01:25.168
Oh, yeah, I was at
the mall today,

01:25.251 --> 01:26.795
and some girl asked me
if I like Shalimar,

01:26.878 --> 01:29.422
and while I was trying to
remember if it was a disco band

01:29.506 --> 01:32.550
or a perfume, she got me.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.593
I'll go wash it off.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.011
Don't use the kitchen sink.

You don't need a plumber.

me to grab you a beer

in the back yard?

the <i> Love, Actually</i> test.

02:01.287 --> 02:04.707
Joy, you know the reason
every guy fails that test?

02:04.791 --> 02:06.584
It's because guys
don't like <i> Love, Actually.</i>

02:06.668 --> 02:08.711
Bob is not like other guys.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.713
I believe he is the one guy

who will love that movie
as much as I do.

Doesn't Bob remind you
a little bit of Colin Firth?
