Julia's wrapping up.

We should head home.

They should've taken us

Liam, the EMTs cleared us.

Hey, wait. H-Hold on.

Hold on, hold on.
I'm-I'm good. I'm good.

04:40.169 --> 04:42.222
Hold on.. Uh, wait a second,
wait a second.

04:42.322 --> 04:42.939
I-I got an idea.

04:43.039 --> 04:45.610
And I-I think
it might be a, um...

04:45.710 --> 04:50.194
Matter of fact,
I know it's a good idea.

04:50.294 --> 04:53.343
Stella Blue,
you never got the chance

04:53.443 --> 04:54.459
to hear my graduation speech.

-Dear God, no.
-WALKER: This is gonna be fun.

05:01.773 --> 05:03.507
Son, you sure you're okay?

05:03.607 --> 05:04.862
I'm fine, Daddy.
I'm-I'm fine.

05:04.962 --> 05:08.171
Just my-my baby girl has to hear
her graduation speech.

05:08.271 --> 05:09.048
I practiced.

05:09.148 --> 05:12.117
Okay. (clears throat)
Stella.

05:12.217 --> 05:15.824
There are moments
a parent thinks about

05:15.924 --> 05:17.259
from day one.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.252
Your-your first words.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.328
Uh, your-your first steps.

05:20.428 --> 05:24.633
Really going for that
long-term retrospective, huh?

05:24.733 --> 05:25.510
Hush, you.

05:25.610 --> 05:30.094
Anyway, graduation has been
one of those moments.

05:30.194 --> 05:32.964
Mostly because for 16 years

05:33.064 --> 05:37.747
we envisioned it
alongside your mother.

05:37.847 --> 05:39.740
She and I sitting together,

05:39.840 --> 05:42.171
watching you cross that stage,

05:42.271 --> 05:45.759
whispering to each other
about how much we wish

05:45.859 --> 05:49.287
we had gotten rid
of Augie first.

05:50.044 --> 05:53.253
Okay, I thought that was
kind of a fun... Tough crowd.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.126
Okay, okay, all right.

05:55.226 --> 05:56.800
I guess what
I'm trying to say is

05:56.900 --> 06:00.547
even though
your mother isn't here,

06:00.647 --> 06:02.221
she would be so proud

06:02.321 --> 06:04.972
of the woman you've become.

06:05.072 --> 06:07.044
A Sauber woman,
in just a few months.

emotionally preparing myself

when I drop you off at college.

That's why you have
a follow car. I got you, Stella.

09:53.511 --> 09:54.726
It's not just a car.
You know that...

09:54.826 --> 09:57.636
I mean, how many times,
right here, did Emily talk about

09:57.736 --> 10:00.068
taking the kids to college
in that Mustang?

10:00.168 --> 10:02.938
And I'm not gonna
let some mechanic ruin that.

10:03.038 --> 10:04.492

at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.634
-Yeah?
-It'll be here, Dad.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.308
Great. See?
How easy was that?

10:11.408 --> 10:15.254
-And that's the positivity
I'm looking for.
-(chuckles): Yeah.

10:15.354 --> 10:16.769
I'll take care
of everything else.

10:16.869 --> 10:19.440
Only thing now is,
uh, "go team" on three.

10:19.540 --> 10:21.792
-(clears throat) One, two...
-I got to go.

10:21.892 --> 10:26.415

-Oh, Dad.

is really particular with prep,

10:49.395 --> 10:52.484

you can take it from here?

10:52.584 --> 10:53.680
Yeah, no, I got this. Um...

10:53.780 --> 10:56.032
Hey, look, I've been meaning
to talk to you about something.

10:56.132 --> 10:56.948
Wait, where you going?

10:57.048 --> 11:00.297
I thought we were tag-teaming
this before your date night.

11:00.397 --> 11:01.811
It's a day of dates, Dad.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.286
Pumpkin patch in the a.m.

11:03.386 --> 11:05.040
Live music for lunch.

11:05.140 --> 11:05.997
And, if you don't mind,

11:06.097 --> 11:09.206
a candlelit dinner
back at our place.

11:09.604 --> 11:11.856
Consider me MIA.

11:11.956 --> 11:13.132
(chuckles)

11:13.232 --> 11:14.487
I got to get this right.

11:14.587 --> 11:16.639
It's Stella's last weekend,

11:16.739 --> 11:19.230
and today might
be my last chance.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.024
Your last chance for what?

11:21.124 --> 11:23.575
A lot of our friends are
breaking up before college,

11:23.675 --> 11:26.604
and I don't want to be
on waiver wires.

11:26.704 --> 11:29.753
I-I got to go. Uh, what was it
you needed to say?

11:29.853 --> 11:30.949
Uh... nothing.

11:31.049 --> 11:33.381
-I got this.
-Okay, yeah.

11:33.481 --> 11:36.370
And please,
make sure to check IDs,

11:36.470 --> 11:37.805
even if it looks
like they're 35.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.519
This family does not need
any more trouble

11:39.619 --> 11:41.512
from a guy
on a one-day pinch hit.

11:41.612 --> 11:46.056
Don't worry, I'm a bartender.
Watch this.

11:46.156 --> 11:49.225
-Okay.
-(chuckles): Okay. All right.

11:51.816 --> 11:54.806
Yo, you drinking that?

11:58.872 --> 12:01.203
(scoffs softly)

12:01.303 --> 12:04.432
Oh, there was
an obstacle course.

12:04.532 --> 12:06.066
There was some bragging.

12:06.166 --> 12:07.740
Mistakes were definitely made.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.212
Eh, just a few more days
to James' hell week,

12:10.312 --> 12:11.288
and you're done with training.

12:11.388 --> 12:13.440
Another thing
for me to look forward to.

12:13.540 --> 12:14.397
(short chuckle)

12:14.497 --> 12:16.609
How's it going in here?

12:17.167 --> 12:19.499
Is everything all right?

12:19.599 --> 12:21.691
Maybe that was
the wrong question to ask.

12:21.791 --> 12:24.362
No, no, no. It's-it's okay.

12:24.462 --> 12:26.455
Have you read it?

12:27.292 --> 12:28.587
Electrocution and waterboarding?

12:28.687 --> 12:31.457
I... just can't bring myself
to do it.

12:31.557 --> 12:33.091
Yeah, probably
the better choice.

12:33.191 --> 12:34.965
I mean, how does someone
come back from this--

12:35.065 --> 12:35.882
this kind of torture?

12:35.982 --> 12:38.911
You mean, how will Walker
come back from medical leave?

12:39.011 --> 12:42.060
Yeah, I'm sure
he's squared away.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.970
Mandatory therapy and PT.

12:45.070 --> 12:46.684
That was utterly unconvincing.

12:46.784 --> 12:51.188
Ugh!
It's because I'm unconvinced.

12:51.288 --> 12:52.942
And at the same time,
I cannot somehow make

12:53.042 --> 12:55.134
Walker being waterboarded
about me.

12:55.234 --> 12:56.569
Yeah, that'd be a real bad look.

12:56.669 --> 13:00.077
Maybe this conversation
stays in this cubicle.

13:00.177 --> 13:01.990
Yeah.

13:02.090 --> 13:03.186
Look.

13:03.286 --> 13:06.614
I fixed Walker's hand
when he came back too early,

13:06.714 --> 13:08.846
and I tried to fix Micki's arm

13:08.946 --> 13:12.792
when she went
through barbed wire.

13:12.892 --> 13:13.988
They hurt themselves.

13:14.088 --> 13:17.775
But that could've just as easily
been the Ranger next to them.

13:17.875 --> 13:21.761
So you're saying
I'm not being selfish?

13:21.861 --> 13:24.671
I'm saying that you should
know for yourself

13:24.771 --> 13:28.079
if Walker's squared away.

13:31.348 --> 13:32.085
(knocking)

13:32.185 --> 13:35.513
Hey. So, August
is joining us today?

13:35.613 --> 13:36.708
Love you, too, man.

13:36.808 --> 13:39.299
We just got off the phone
with Deon.

13:39.399 --> 13:40.415
And it was not good.

13:40.515 --> 13:41.531
We can't foot the bill anymore,

13:41.631 --> 13:44.282
so I guess there's no kickback
to lie to dad for us.

13:44.382 --> 13:45.518
COLTON:
I've had a good tip week.

13:45.618 --> 13:48.148
Maybe I can throw extra
to help keep up the charade

13:48.248 --> 13:49.703
till you guys
cross the Oregon border?

13:49.803 --> 13:51.417
Okay, so kick the can?

13:51.517 --> 13:52.214
No, buy us time.

13:52.314 --> 13:53.370
For your date?
Okay, cool.

13:53.470 --> 13:55.204
So then whenever she's chilling
in her dorm,

13:55.304 --> 13:58.392
I take the heat
for most of this? No, thanks.

13:58.492 --> 14:01.322
Hey, no one's saying that.

14:03.076 --> 14:07.042
Look, if I'm leaving for Sauber
tomorrow...

14:07.142 --> 14:07.560
If?

14:07.660 --> 14:10.590
I just mean...
I can't leave Augie with this.

14:10.690 --> 14:11.347
I won't.

14:11.447 --> 14:13.818
Okay, then what if we just...

14:13.918 --> 14:15.014
rented a look-alike, right?

14:15.114 --> 14:17.725
'67 Mustang?
Dad's none the wiser.

14:17.825 --> 14:19.598
No, I think he'd be the wiser.

14:19.698 --> 14:21.830
You got a better plan
you're sitting on?

14:21.930 --> 14:24.581
Actually, I do.

14:24.681 --> 14:27.232
We steal the real thing back.

14:28.706 --> 14:29.483
What?

14:29.583 --> 14:32.911
I've been doing some digging
the past few weeks.

14:33.011 --> 14:33.948
I searched local hashtags,

14:34.048 --> 14:36.021
and after
some late-night scrolling

14:36.121 --> 14:39.369
I found some car club
enthusiasts posting about it.

14:39.469 --> 14:42.039
About her--
the woman who robbed us.

14:42.139 --> 14:44.989
Her handle's S-Nines,
and she's been using

14:45.089 --> 14:46.265
Mom's Mustang to drag race.

14:46.365 --> 14:50.809
Yeah, I-I've seen this
on a flyer at The Side Step.

14:50.909 --> 14:52.363
Yeah, Desert Speed Wars.

14:52.463 --> 14:54.197
Car shows, late-night races.

14:54.297 --> 14:54.914
But, Stella,

14:55.014 --> 14:58.661
you really think you want to go
and confront them?

14:58.761 --> 15:01.412
I don't see any other way.

15:01.512 --> 15:02.567
But also, this isn't your mess,

15:02.667 --> 15:04.760
so I completely understand
if you don't want to get...

15:04.860 --> 15:08.826
Just stop. I-I wouldn't miss
our last day for anything.

15:08.926 --> 15:11.456
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

15:11.556 --> 15:13.688
And this might be
the only child in me speaking,

15:13.788 --> 15:15.961
but I am amazed at the lengths
you two have gone

15:16.061 --> 15:17.276
to, like, keep this charade up.

15:17.376 --> 15:19.508
I mean, we're talking
grand theft audio now?

15:19.608 --> 15:23.096
Like, what won't you guys do
for your dad?

15:23.196 --> 15:26.085
Well, I mean, you kind of
haven't seen him this summer.

15:26.185 --> 15:28.796
And it's not GTA, it's...

15:28.896 --> 15:32.224
it's taking back what's ours,
what's mine.

15:32.324 --> 15:35.492
Thankfully, Uncle Hoyt
taught me a thing or two

15:35.592 --> 15:37.625
about how to hot-wire.

They're used to getting
the short end of the stick.

16:07.361 --> 16:08.138
I wouldn't say that.

16:08.238 --> 16:12.124
I would just say that August and
Stella are dealing with change

16:12.224 --> 16:13.399
in their own ways.

16:13.499 --> 16:14.157
Right.

-Exactly.

16:18.641 --> 16:19.896
Augie can't shut up about it.

16:19.996 --> 16:22.368
Mostly about getting
a bigger room.

16:22.468 --> 16:24.879
Yeah. It's their own ways.

eight years old, Em and I went

19:47.429 --> 19:48.964
over-bought--
camping equipment.

19:49.064 --> 19:51.076

tents, water purifiers,

19:51.176 --> 19:53.428
one of those little,
uh, cast iron things

19:53.528 --> 19:54.943
where you heat sauce
above a camp fire.

19:55.043 --> 19:57.534
Geez, that must have
added, like, six pounds

19:57.634 --> 19:58.610

Cass, but I got it covered.

21:03.483 --> 21:06.532
-I am squared away.
-Fine.

21:06.632 --> 21:08.565
Then I can go first.

21:08.665 --> 21:09.880
Okay.

21:09.980 --> 21:10.478
Fine.

21:10.578 --> 21:12.870
I'm scared to get back
in the truck with you, Walker.

21:12.970 --> 21:17.374
Okay? Lately, this is stuff
I never saw as a trooper.

21:17.474 --> 21:21.380
Chemical weapons?
Torture?

21:22.098 --> 21:23.632
I leave my house in the morning

21:23.732 --> 21:27.140
and I don't know
if I'm coming back at night.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.973
And I get that
that's part of the job.

21:29.073 --> 21:31.963
But if every day
I have to push that down,

21:32.063 --> 21:34.354
I need to feel safe with you.

21:34.454 --> 21:35.470
And this guy?

21:35.570 --> 21:37.344
He doesn't make me feel safe.

21:37.444 --> 21:39.217
-(water dripping)
-Do you hear that?

21:39.317 --> 21:42.486
Wow, that's really
your response?

21:42.586 --> 21:44.718
Yes, I hear the water leak.

21:44.818 --> 21:48.047
Good, yeah.
Yeah, I hear it, too.

21:52.989 --> 21:54.165
Aah!

21:54.265 --> 21:56.875
But I-I hear you,
as well, Cassie, I do.

21:56.975 --> 21:58.709
Trust me,
I learned from my mistake

21:58.809 --> 22:00.742
of going back too soon
with the Rodeo Kings.

22:00.842 --> 22:02.855
-No, but this isn't that.
-I know this isn't that.

22:02.955 --> 22:07.578
That's why I'm doing
the therapy and the PT.

22:08.376 --> 22:10.986
Cassie, I would never
do anything

22:11.086 --> 22:13.736
to hurt you
or put you in harm's way.

22:13.836 --> 22:17.543
You know that, right?

22:17.982 --> 22:20.134
Cassie?

22:23.403 --> 22:26.353
Think I found your stuff.

22:27.668 --> 22:29.322
Whoa, Stella's cake's
looking good, Mama.

22:29.422 --> 22:33.706
-Thanks.
-Dibs on leftovers
for the road trip crew.

22:33.806 --> 22:35.739
Auggie will thank me later.

22:35.839 --> 22:38.529
Did you make this cake?

22:38.629 --> 22:40.602
No.

22:40.702 --> 22:42.715
Well, then ask
instead of calling dibs

22:42.815 --> 22:44.110
like you're eight years old,

22:44.210 --> 22:45.465
and you and Cordi want

22:45.565 --> 22:47.777
the same superhuman samurai.

22:47.877 --> 22:49.571
(laughs)

22:49.671 --> 22:50.687
He always got it.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.760
That's only because
you wanted to just

22:52.860 --> 22:54.952
piss him... make him mad.

22:55.052 --> 22:56.546
I think, well...

22:56.646 --> 22:59.895
I might be old enough
to concede that that's true.

22:59.995 --> 23:01.927
(both chuckle)

23:02.027 --> 23:04.160
Can you believe
she's going away?

23:04.260 --> 23:06.671
-Mm.
-Our Stella Blue.

23:06.771 --> 23:08.744
I've been trying
to push it out of my head

23:08.844 --> 23:11.893
until after
the road trip, but...

23:11.993 --> 23:13.965
Sweetie.

23:14.065 --> 23:15.081
Hmm?

23:15.181 --> 23:16.636
Are you sure about that?

23:16.736 --> 23:17.393
Yeah, we've been,

23:17.493 --> 23:19.386
we've been talking
about this road trip for years.

23:19.486 --> 23:21.658
Yeah, but have you
heard your brother

23:21.758 --> 23:24.847
say that you're going, lately?

23:24.947 --> 23:27.358
I just, I don't want you
to get your hopes up

23:27.458 --> 23:29.232
if you don't.

23:29.332 --> 23:32.181
I'll talk to him.

23:32.281 --> 23:35.510
Haven't you done that already?

23:36.586 --> 23:37.403
Look.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.994
We found an equilibrium
around here.

23:40.094 --> 23:42.186
A... fragile one.

23:42.286 --> 23:43.940
Why am I not surprised?

23:44.040 --> 23:46.013
-Sweetie...
-No, no. By all means.

23:46.113 --> 23:48.723
Let Cordell dictate
how everybody else

23:48.823 --> 23:52.072
has to act just because
that's what's best for him.

23:52.172 --> 23:54.822
I'm so glad that's priority.

23:54.922 --> 23:57.851
I was in there, too, you know.

23:57.951 --> 23:59.526
That's not what I meant.

23:59.626 --> 24:00.203
(knocking)

24:00.303 --> 24:03.811
-Somebody else better get that.
-(door slams)

24:08.395 --> 24:10.806
Oh, look at you, just walking
into people's homes.

24:10.906 --> 24:12.879
-Guess I'm rubbing off on you.
-You are not

24:12.979 --> 24:14.952
-rubbing off on me, I was...
-Mm-hmm.

24:15.052 --> 24:17.941
Anyways, how's everything going
with Walker?

24:18.041 --> 24:19.456
Honestly, not...

24:19.556 --> 24:20.412
Great!

24:20.512 --> 24:21.608
-We're all here.
-Barnett, hey!

24:21.708 --> 24:23.801
I didn't know you were
coming over. Well, that's good.

24:23.901 --> 24:27.109
'Cause I need some help
with the heavy lifting.

24:27.209 --> 24:28.743
(laughs)
Sure.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.975
Uh, so Stella's not back yet?

24:31.075 --> 24:32.729
No, she's, uh...

24:32.829 --> 24:33.965
Awesome. No, she's...

24:34.065 --> 24:36.476
You hear about this whole saga
with the Mustang?

24:36.576 --> 24:37.951
-No.
-Two months in the shop.

24:38.051 --> 24:41.259
Honestly, I don't even think
a-anything was wrong with it.

24:41.359 --> 24:43.133
If-if Augie wasn't
such a bad liar

24:43.233 --> 24:45.206
I would be certain
that something's up.

24:45.306 --> 24:47.358
They've been weird all summer.

24:47.458 --> 24:48.195
Kids.

24:48.295 --> 24:51.524
TREY:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh...

24:52.401 --> 24:54.134
-The Mustang?
-Yeah.

24:54.234 --> 24:57.921
It's not supposed to be
at Desert Speed Wars, is it?

24:58.021 --> 25:00.990
Desert Speed Wars, the car show?

25:01.090 --> 25:02.066
Yeah.

25:02.166 --> 25:04.299
It better not be.

25:04.399 --> 25:08.265
Then I think you might
have yourself a problem.

25:08.903 --> 25:11.354
(indistinct chatter)

25:11.454 --> 25:14.463
We just need them away from
the car for a minute or two.

25:14.563 --> 25:17.014
You give me an opening
and I'll handle the rest.

25:17.114 --> 25:19.764
Okay, so, like, distract,

25:19.864 --> 25:22.315
smash and then grab?

25:22.415 --> 25:24.269
Less smash.

25:24.369 --> 25:26.860
But, yes, grab and go.

25:26.960 --> 25:27.617
(man sighs)

25:27.717 --> 25:31.125
I'm pretty sure you did clip
that guy in the race, though.

25:31.225 --> 25:33.218
(laughs)

25:34.174 --> 25:36.944
You know, pumpkin patch
would have been nice.

25:37.044 --> 25:40.890
But, uh, this is
one hell of a last date.

25:40.990 --> 25:43.402
What do you mean, a last date?

25:43.502 --> 25:46.351
Uh, no, no, um...

25:46.451 --> 25:48.065
I don't know, it's just...

25:48.165 --> 25:51.055
the Oregon of it all?

25:51.155 --> 25:53.606
You've been sending
mixed signals.

25:53.706 --> 25:55.439
What are you talking about?

25:55.539 --> 25:57.393
You haven't registered
for classes.

25:57.493 --> 25:59.864
Or opened the college
survival kit I made you.

25:59.964 --> 26:03.013
And just like you said
about your dad, you...

26:03.113 --> 26:06.481
you've been
kind of off all summer.

26:06.581 --> 26:08.553
Thought it might be about me.

26:08.653 --> 26:10.068
About us.

26:10.168 --> 26:11.344
Colton.

26:11.444 --> 26:12.978
I'm not breaking up with you.

26:13.078 --> 26:15.330
-(laughing)
-Unless...

26:15.430 --> 26:16.525
Is that what you want?

26:16.625 --> 26:18.479
No, no, no, no, no.
Of course not.

26:18.579 --> 26:20.312
I love you and I don't want...

26:20.412 --> 26:22.565
That's not...

26:23.282 --> 26:23.979
Hey, guys?

26:24.079 --> 26:26.012

My family knows a thing or two

28:04.687 --> 28:06.939
-about vehicle relocation,
too, remember?
-Mm-hmm.

28:07.039 --> 28:10.526

that I've been off all summer.

But, babe, it wasn't
anything to do with us.

28:18.359 --> 28:20.631
Don't clip it, though.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.700
Nice.

(engine sputtering)

28:26.092 --> 28:28.423
Um, yeah, you might want
to speed this up a little bit.

28:28.523 --> 28:32.210
STELLA:
Mm-hmm, almost there.

Hey, that's my car!

(clicker chirps)

28:59.375 --> 29:03.042
(engine sputter, stops)

29:05.593 --> 29:08.025
Hey!

29:10.416 --> 29:12.429
Wait a second.

29:12.529 --> 29:13.505
You're the Ranger's daughter.

29:13.605 --> 29:15.897
-From the tip line.
-STELLA: And you're the woman

29:15.997 --> 29:17.810
who kicked my family
when we were down.

29:17.910 --> 29:21.158
Do you have any idea
what this car meant to me?

29:21.258 --> 29:23.032
What it meant to my family?

29:23.132 --> 29:25.184
I think you should
get out of here.

29:25.284 --> 29:27.416
No one needs to get hurt.

29:27.516 --> 29:27.975
No.

29:28.075 --> 29:31.721
You gonna call the Rangers,
then? Call your dad?

29:31.821 --> 29:33.595
He doesn't need this right now.

29:33.695 --> 29:34.950
That's why we're here.

29:35.050 --> 29:37.581
-Come on, Stella,
let's just bounce.
-STELLA: No.

29:37.681 --> 29:39.933
This car has been
in my family for 20 years.

29:40.033 --> 29:42.683
My late uncle
gave it to my late mom,

29:42.783 --> 29:43.520
and you ruined it.

29:43.620 --> 29:44.995
I think it was
the other way around.

29:45.095 --> 29:49.599
I was supposed to take that car
to college with my dad.

29:49.958 --> 29:52.289
He's okay, by the way.

29:52.389 --> 29:53.246
Back from captivity.

29:53.346 --> 29:56.554
You know, after being kidnapped
in his own front yard.

29:56.654 --> 29:59.663
But the one thing
that he's been set on

29:59.763 --> 30:02.454
since he has been home
is this road trip.

30:02.554 --> 30:03.809
For 16 years, him and my mom

30:03.909 --> 30:06.240
have talked about it.
Do I even want to go?

30:06.340 --> 30:09.230
Who could care
about a thing like that

30:09.330 --> 30:10.625
at a time like this?

30:10.725 --> 30:13.994
Do I even want to go to college?

30:15.229 --> 30:17.800
No one's bothered to ask.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.952
Even though I just wish

30:20.052 --> 30:24.357
that somebody
would bother to ask me.

30:25.792 --> 30:28.323
But I am not asking you,
I am telling you.

30:28.423 --> 30:30.994
You are not taking this
away from him.

30:31.094 --> 30:33.066
Hell or high water, that car

30:33.166 --> 30:36.395
is in my driveway by tonight.

30:38.787 --> 30:41.118
Condolences to your mom.

30:41.218 --> 30:42.593
And to your uncle.

30:42.693 --> 30:46.679
And to whatever happened
to your dad.

30:47.596 --> 30:50.007
Family pressure...

30:50.107 --> 30:51.681
can be complicated.

30:51.781 --> 30:55.667
Look, nice try
on the hotwire, but...

30:55.767 --> 30:58.059
just take her home.

30:58.159 --> 30:58.976
Consider the mods yours.

30:59.076 --> 31:03.699
With the promise you won't
have your dad come arrest me.

31:07.367 --> 31:10.157
I promise I'll try.

31:12.469 --> 31:14.681
AUGUST: If you didn't grab my
arms, I would have slipped

31:14.781 --> 31:16.753
-and fallen under the wheel.
It would've been bad.
-Oh, my God,

31:16.853 --> 31:20.141
I am so happy you got in.
(chuckles)

31:20.241 --> 31:21.816
Man.

31:21.916 --> 31:24.207
Here we are.

31:24.307 --> 31:26.479
You know, I got to
hand it to you, Stel.

31:26.579 --> 31:27.954
Thanks, but you were right.

31:28.054 --> 31:30.106
It turns out it was
more smash and grab.

31:30.206 --> 31:32.857
-I mean, it's not
a bad right hook, right?
-No.

31:32.957 --> 31:36.664
I see the car's out of the shop.

31:37.660 --> 31:38.716
Incredible.

31:38.816 --> 31:40.470
So, tell me.

31:40.570 --> 31:43.281
How was Desert Speed Wars?

31:54.521 --> 31:55.816
What? You charmer.

31:55.916 --> 31:56.932
Your first "I love you"?

31:57.032 --> 31:58.886
I thought you would have
said that already.

31:58.986 --> 31:59.882
The first day you met her.

31:59.982 --> 32:02.632
Well, yeah, I know,
but there's been a lot

32:02.732 --> 32:05.622
of other stuff going on, so...

32:05.722 --> 32:07.017
Well, that's fair.

32:07.117 --> 32:09.249
Um, look, that's actually
what I wanted

32:09.349 --> 32:12.698
to talk to you about, son, um...

32:14.611 --> 32:17.022
Your mother and I have decided

32:17.122 --> 32:20.311
we're gonna give it
another shot.

32:22.344 --> 32:24.356
-(laughs)
-What's so funny?

32:24.456 --> 32:25.791
I've so known this was coming.

32:25.891 --> 32:27.904
-You didn't know
this was coming.
-Yes.

32:28.004 --> 32:29.458
You guys literally spent
a calendar year

32:29.558 --> 32:34.302
conjuring new and different ways
not to sign divorce papers.

32:36.335 --> 32:37.112
Yeah, you're right.

32:37.212 --> 32:39.862
Just follow your heart, Dad.

32:39.962 --> 32:42.792
Thanks.

32:43.589 --> 32:46.399
Well, I'm ready to fight for it.

32:46.499 --> 32:49.947
That does mean
that I'm gonna go to Thalia

32:50.047 --> 32:52.298
and help her open
her private practice.

32:52.398 --> 32:53.494
Are you asking me
to come with you?

32:53.594 --> 32:56.603
No, not asking you...
I saw the way you look at her.

32:56.703 --> 32:58.277
"I love you," no, I...

32:58.377 --> 33:03.519
I was just hoping that you would
maybe look after the ranch.

33:04.038 --> 33:04.934
Yeah.

33:05.034 --> 33:06.289
And Geri offered to help.

33:06.389 --> 33:09.359
Oh, yeah, thank God.
Adult supervision.

33:09.459 --> 33:12.189
You need it.

33:12.289 --> 33:15.438
(chuckles)

33:17.391 --> 33:19.403
When did they hang
Denise the deer back up?

33:19.503 --> 33:22.273
COLTON:
Oh, um, Mom insisted.

33:22.373 --> 33:23.987
Just told Aunt Geri
that was gonna be

33:24.087 --> 33:26.339
water under the bridge
and all that.

33:26.439 --> 33:28.731
Austin's been good for you, huh?

33:28.831 --> 33:30.086
(Colton chuckles)

33:30.186 --> 33:33.315
We-we can call it a mixed bag.

33:33.415 --> 33:36.783
But, um, good for us.

33:36.883 --> 33:39.533
Yeah.

33:39.633 --> 33:42.782
♪Heart attack kid.♪

33:44.336 --> 33:47.066
Both of you... sit!

33:47.166 --> 33:48.940
And I can't believe

33:49.040 --> 33:50.773
I have to say this explicitly,

33:50.873 --> 33:51.770
but do not go anywhere

33:51.870 --> 33:54.082
until I'm back home
and that woman

33:54.182 --> 33:56.394
-and her goons are in jail.
-Dad, don't.

33:56.494 --> 33:58.267
You don't have to do anything.

33:58.367 --> 33:59.383
-Excuse me?
-We're here,

33:59.483 --> 34:00.938
we're safe,
the Mustang is fine.

34:01.038 --> 34:02.453
-Can't it all just be over?
-Okay.

34:02.553 --> 34:06.459
That's not how this works,
and... matter of fact...

34:06.818 --> 34:08.471
...I'm not leaving these
with you.

34:08.571 --> 34:10.903
No, you know what, I can't
wrap my head around this!

34:11.003 --> 34:13.972
Why didn't you two come to me?
I thought we were past the point

34:14.072 --> 34:16.045
of keeping secrets
from each other.

34:16.145 --> 34:17.041
Yeah, so did we.

34:17.141 --> 34:19.772
What's that supposed to mean?

34:21.167 --> 34:23.897
Dad, come on.

34:23.997 --> 34:26.249
Ever since a horrible
homecoming dinner

34:26.349 --> 34:29.318
you insisted we have,
you have been

34:29.418 --> 34:30.714
-putting on a show.
-I-I am...

34:30.814 --> 34:34.839
-squared...
-Squared away.
-Yeah, we've heard that.

34:35.318 --> 34:37.051
This is why
we didn't come to you.

34:37.151 --> 34:40.121
We were afraid of being
the people who burst

34:40.221 --> 34:43.270
your bubble because
if you spiraled and got hurt

34:43.370 --> 34:45.302
because of something
that we did,

34:45.402 --> 34:48.132
I don't think
I'd ever forgive myself.

34:48.232 --> 34:49.488
And I know it sounds silly,

34:49.588 --> 34:53.912
but we were afraid that
the Mustang would break the dam.

34:54.012 --> 34:55.746
The-the Mu...
(laughs)

34:55.846 --> 34:58.995
I mean, look at you now, Dad.

34:59.672 --> 35:03.000
Those kidnappers
took a piece of you.

35:03.100 --> 35:06.289
And we just didn't
want to lose any more.

35:12.468 --> 35:14.161
I had no idea

35:14.261 --> 35:17.430
y'all felt this way.

35:17.530 --> 35:21.137
It's-it's kind of hard not to.

35:21.237 --> 35:22.771
I never want either of you

35:22.871 --> 35:27.495
to feel like there's something
you can't tell me.

35:27.814 --> 35:28.989
In that case,

35:29.089 --> 35:32.517
August, can you
give us a minute?

35:41.765 --> 35:44.156
I love you.

35:46.907 --> 35:49.657
(clears throat)

35:57.829 --> 36:00.539
I'll go first.

36:05.721 --> 36:09.667
You don't want
to go to college, do you?

36:10.145 --> 36:11.959
How'd you know?

36:12.059 --> 36:13.234
Just kind of had a feeling

36:13.334 --> 36:17.300
I wasn't the only one keeping
appearances up this summer.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.289
Are you mad?

36:20.389 --> 36:21.844
No.

36:21.944 --> 36:23.319
No, I'm not mad.

36:23.419 --> 36:26.109
I'm just... confused.

36:26.209 --> 36:28.142
Uh, you-you seemed so excited.

36:28.242 --> 36:30.613
I don't think
I ever really was, though.

36:30.713 --> 36:32.925
It just... it seemed
like the next thing.

36:33.025 --> 36:35.715
And Mom wanted me to,
you wanted me to...

36:35.815 --> 36:38.785
But this is your future,
Stella Blue.

36:38.885 --> 36:42.173
What do you want to do next?

36:42.273 --> 36:44.266
If not Sauber?

36:45.023 --> 36:46.757
I don't know.

36:46.857 --> 36:50.006
A gap year, maybe?

36:50.484 --> 36:52.018
It's just, you were taken.

36:52.118 --> 36:56.822
And suddenly college felt...
really small.

36:58.376 --> 37:00.588
Okay, um...

37:00.688 --> 37:03.817
-okay.
-Okay.

37:03.917 --> 37:07.404
Then we'll figure it out...
together.

37:07.504 --> 37:10.374
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

37:16.911 --> 37:19.303
(sniffles)

37:23.090 --> 37:27.155
I hear you gave your mama
a piece of your mind.

37:28.152 --> 37:30.882
Um, it's possible
that I overreacted.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.716
Well, you don't say?

37:32.816 --> 37:36.961
She didn't mean to put you out
like that, you know.

37:37.559 --> 37:39.332
I know. I'll, uh...

37:39.432 --> 37:41.724
I'll apologize in the morning.

37:41.824 --> 37:43.279
Goodnight, dad.

37:43.379 --> 37:46.408
No, William, hold on.

37:47.763 --> 37:50.314
Sit down.

37:54.300 --> 37:56.034
All right.

37:56.134 --> 37:58.784
Now, we're gonna do this

37:58.884 --> 38:00.658
exactly once.

38:00.758 --> 38:03.807
And it was
your mother's idea, so...

38:03.907 --> 38:06.996
if we both leave this room
feeling uncomfortable,

38:07.096 --> 38:08.949
we can blame her and...

38:09.049 --> 38:11.540
stoically go hammer fences.

38:11.640 --> 38:14.310
(short chuckle)

38:15.825 --> 38:17.519
'73...

38:17.619 --> 38:19.472
and '74...

38:19.572 --> 38:22.222
weren't easy on me.

38:22.322 --> 38:24.813
I'd, uh...

38:24.913 --> 38:27.683
Well, I was back.

38:27.783 --> 38:32.108
But it was like I could
still smell the napalm.

38:32.208 --> 38:34.459
And I thought...

38:34.559 --> 38:35.815
well, hell...

38:35.915 --> 38:38.007
brews and banter
down at the VFW--

38:38.107 --> 38:40.598
that's all the help I needed.

38:40.698 --> 38:43.887
'Cause those people got it.

38:46.318 --> 38:48.331
I reckon that's
why you're so fixated

38:48.431 --> 38:49.885
on talking to your brother.

38:49.985 --> 38:52.038
'Cause he gets it, don't he?

38:52.138 --> 38:54.469
What you two
went through in there.

38:54.569 --> 38:56.701
How did you-how did you stop it?

38:56.801 --> 38:58.336
The smell?

38:58.436 --> 39:00.448
Met a woman.

39:00.548 --> 39:03.777
No, not like that.

39:04.614 --> 39:08.181
She took me out
on the open range.

39:08.281 --> 39:12.406
On a horse that was
as broken as I was.

39:12.506 --> 39:15.037
They helped me
sort out my storm.

39:15.137 --> 39:17.867
You saw a-a therapist?

39:17.967 --> 39:19.462
You, of all people--

39:19.562 --> 39:23.089
you saw an equine therapist?

39:23.189 --> 39:25.042
Cordell's seeing a therapist.

39:25.142 --> 39:28.291
Is that why he won't talk to me?

39:28.690 --> 39:30.662
Son, I think
every time he looks at you,

39:30.762 --> 39:35.187
he sees a fresh hell
he's trying too hard to forget.

39:35.665 --> 39:36.721
I see it, too.

39:36.821 --> 39:38.993
Just because Cordell's
not ready to talk

39:39.093 --> 39:43.757
doesn't mean that you don't
have to talk to someone.

39:44.195 --> 39:46.866
You hear me?

39:49.736 --> 39:51.748
All right.

39:51.848 --> 39:54.320

you were still here.
-(laughs) Well...

40:09.945 --> 40:11.400
Abby made a cake.

40:11.500 --> 40:14.070
-Yeah.
-And suddenly, no occasion.

40:14.170 --> 40:16.063
Sacrifices had to be made.

40:16.163 --> 40:19.053
