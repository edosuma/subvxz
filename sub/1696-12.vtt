00:12.381 --> 00:16.283
Darling, are you done
packing yet? We gotta get to the airport.

00:16.585 --> 00:19.315
Uh, almost got it.

00:25.794 --> 00:29.286
- Daddy, got any room in your suitcase?
- No.

00:29.364 --> 00:31.229
- But what about that...
- No.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.291
- But what about the...
- No.

00:35.337 --> 00:37.430
Excuse me, Miss Montana,

00:38.373 --> 00:40.671
there's a girl out here
who wants to see you.

00:40.742 --> 00:43.643
Claims she's Maddie
from the candy counter.

00:43.712 --> 00:46.340
You want me to tell her you're not here?

00:46.582 --> 00:49.847
But she's right there. I can see her.

00:50.219 --> 00:52.847
Not if her bodyguard says you can't.

00:53.488 --> 00:55.683
Sorry, Hannah, can't see you.

00:56.291 --> 00:58.885
By the way,
love the top.

00:59.862 --> 01:02.387
Hey, Roxy, she's a friend of mine.
She can come in.

01:02.464 --> 01:06.867
You're in luck. She's here.
Hey, I got my eyes on you.

01:08.237 --> 01:10.501
Hey, Maddie,
just the tush I've been looking for.

01:10.572 --> 01:12.301
Can you close my suitcase?

01:12.374 --> 01:15.366
Wait till I tell my friends that
I sat on Hannah Montana's suitcase.

01:19.381 --> 01:21.576
You're not heavy enough. Here.

01:22.951 --> 01:24.919
Hold these phone books.

01:27.890 --> 01:30.017
I just wanted to say goodbye
and thanks for the tickets.

01:30.092 --> 01:31.525
Your concert was awesome.

01:31.593 --> 01:33.891
Thanks. Now bounce up and down.

01:35.030 --> 01:37.498
Well, we are a full-service hotel.

01:38.300 --> 01:41.167
<i>I want my mullet back</i>

01:41.236 --> 01:44.603
<i>My old Camaro and my eight-track</i>

01:45.173 --> 01:49.576
Wow, that guy sounds just like
the singer my mom used to listen to.

01:50.012 --> 01:53.345
Oh, what did they call him? You know,
the "Honky-Tonk Heartthrob. "

01:53.415 --> 01:55.246
Oh, you're talking about Robbie Ray?

01:55.317 --> 01:58.081
Yeah, yeah, that's the guy.
He had a couple of top 10 songs.

01:58.153 --> 02:00.917
Actually, three number ones,
two top fives,

02:00.989 --> 02:03.924
Music Video of the Year.
But who's counting?

02:04.226 --> 02:07.093
Oh, my gosh, you're Robbie Ray.

02:07.763 --> 02:09.788
My mom thought you were dead.

02:09.865 --> 02:12.561
She's gonna be so excited you're alive!

02:12.801 --> 02:14.666
I'm kind of happy about that myself.

02:14.736 --> 02:17.967
Yeah, what about we take some of
the happy and put it over here?

02:18.040 --> 02:19.701
I'm on the case.

02:20.142 --> 02:21.632
So, why aren't you still performing?

02:21.710 --> 02:25.146
Oh, no, this old dog stopped howling
a long time ago.

02:25.380 --> 02:28.508
<i>Howling Dogs. </i>
That was my mom's favorite album.

02:28.984 --> 02:31.214
- Don't you miss singing?
- Maybe a little.

02:31.286 --> 02:33.277
Wow. It must've taken something huge

02:33.355 --> 02:35.482
to make you walk away
from a career like that.

02:35.557 --> 02:36.922
Yeah, it did.

02:36.992 --> 02:39.984
These days, my life's all about
managing Hannah Montana.

02:40.062 --> 02:41.620
That's just the way I like it.

02:41.697 --> 02:44.928
Well, darling, we got a plane to catch.
Let's get ready to head for the airport.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.230
Man, I couldn't live with myself

02:47.302 --> 02:51.568
if I knew I was the person holding
Robbie Ray back from howling again.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.132
Wow.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.577
Well, it was nice meeting you.

02:56.645 --> 02:59.739
Hope you enjoyed your stay
at the Tipton Hotel.

03:01.717 --> 03:02.911
Holding him back?

03:04.086 --> 03:06.554
Well, not for long.

03:16.999 --> 03:18.626
<i> Come on!</i>

03:18.700 --> 03:21.168
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

03:22.571 --> 03:26.029
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

03:26.308 --> 03:30.142
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

03:30.212 --> 03:34.239
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

03:34.950 --> 03:38.181
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

03:38.253 --> 03:43.486
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

03:43.592 --> 03:47.722
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:47.796 --> 03:49.821
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

03:49.898 --> 03:51.525
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

03:51.600 --> 03:55.559
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:56.071 --> 03:57.538
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:57.606 --> 04:00.439
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

04:07.382 --> 04:10.112
I can't believe this is your dad.

04:11.787 --> 04:13.755
It's lucky records were so big.

04:13.822 --> 04:16.791
There's no way you'd fit
all that hair on a CD.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.384
It's called a mullet.

04:19.528 --> 04:24.022
"Business in the front,
a party in the back. " Oh, yeah!

04:24.900 --> 04:26.959
Before your dad was a dad,
he was cool.

04:27.035 --> 04:30.129
Before my dad was a dad,
he was an accountant.

04:31.073 --> 04:34.270
"Addition in front,
subtraction in the back. "

04:34.976 --> 04:37.308
- That's not the same, is it?
- No.

04:37.612 --> 04:41.207
You should've seen the look on his face
when that girl in Boston recognized him.

04:41.283 --> 04:43.751
I don't care what he says.
I know he misses being on stage.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.979
He even had his own doll!

04:47.789 --> 04:49.552
<i>Yeah, doggies. </i>

04:50.625 --> 04:53.856
You guys. You guys,
you gotta check this out. Look.

04:54.229 --> 04:56.720
It's labeled <i>"Robbie Palooza. "</i>

04:56.998 --> 04:59.831
Cool, Dad had his own palooza.

05:00.535 --> 05:02.400
My dad had his own calculator.

05:02.471 --> 05:03.460
Yeah.

05:09.878 --> 05:11.470
Look how much fun he's having.

05:11.546 --> 05:15.380
I can't believe it.
You've got a great voice, he's awesome.

05:16.084 --> 05:17.813
What's your talent?

05:18.420 --> 05:21.514
Oh, uh, well, I don't like to brag,
but, uh...

05:27.462 --> 05:30.363
And when I'm clammy,
I can do it behind my knees.

05:31.566 --> 05:32.658
Ew!

05:32.734 --> 05:36.261
Slow down, Son,
gonna give yourself another rash.

05:36.938 --> 05:39.270
Whoa, <i>Robbie Palooza. </i>

05:39.341 --> 05:41.206
What are you watching
this old thing for?

05:41.276 --> 05:44.370
Mr. Stewart, you were incredible.
What happened?

05:48.783 --> 05:51.877
I mean, why aren't you still performing?

05:54.289 --> 05:56.257
That was a long time ago.

05:56.324 --> 05:58.019
These days, I got my hands full

05:58.093 --> 06:00.823
watching over Miley
and Sir Toots-A-Lot.

06:02.164 --> 06:04.598
Come on, Dad, we're practically adults.

06:04.666 --> 06:07.260
I mean, if you wanna go back out
and howl with the dogs,

06:07.335 --> 06:08.734
there's nothing holding you back.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.998
Sweetheart, that was 10 years ago.

06:11.072 --> 06:14.007
I bet my old manager doesn't even
remember my name.

06:15.477 --> 06:18.241
Robbie Ray, open this door!

06:18.446 --> 06:21.506
Well, is that your old manager,
Marty Klein?

06:21.583 --> 06:23.175
I believe it is.

06:24.319 --> 06:26.514
What a weird coinkidink.

06:27.389 --> 06:29.152
You guys are smooth.

06:29.424 --> 06:31.722
Where is my Honky-Tonk Heartthrob?

06:31.793 --> 06:34.057
There he is. Look at you.

06:34.129 --> 06:36.495
You look exactly the same.
No, you look better.

06:36.565 --> 06:39.056
I hate you. I love you. Give me a hug.

06:39.601 --> 06:42.695
Madman Marty, the one man party.

06:42.771 --> 06:45.137
- I've missed you, old buddy.
- Stop it, you'll make me cry.

06:45.207 --> 06:49.371
And look,
there's handsome young Jackson.

06:49.444 --> 06:51.912
And pretty little Miley,

06:51.980 --> 06:56.212
who I have not spoken to or had
contact with in any way whatsoever.

06:57.953 --> 06:59.853
Especially on the phone.

06:59.921 --> 07:03.288
- It's okay, Marty. He knows I called you.
- Good, 'cause I'm a terrible liar.

07:03.358 --> 07:06.054
Hi, sweetheart.
Blondes are big this year.

07:06.127 --> 07:08.527
If you got any talent, call me.

07:10.332 --> 07:14.735
So, Marty, got anything interesting
to tell my father?

07:14.803 --> 07:16.668
Don't rush me, kid.
I'm building to the big finish.

07:16.738 --> 07:17.830
Okay.

07:17.906 --> 07:20.807
So, I called The Roadhouse
in San Diego.

07:21.509 --> 07:24.137
You say the word and all next week,

07:24.212 --> 07:27.375
you, Robbie Ray,
are the special guest star.

07:27.849 --> 07:31.307
Ladies and gentlemen, Marty Klein!

07:33.655 --> 07:35.555
Whoa, let's just slow down a minute.

07:35.624 --> 07:39.424
You walked away at the top because
you wanted to be with your babies.

07:39.494 --> 07:41.155
Well, take a look.

07:41.263 --> 07:42.924
They're not babies anymore.

07:42.998 --> 07:45.694
I believe Mr. Klein is correct, Father.

07:47.369 --> 07:49.769
Oh, come on, Dad,
you know you wanna be on stage again.

07:49.838 --> 07:52.329
- Here's your chance.
- Think about it, handsome.

07:52.407 --> 07:56.104
You, the lights, the stage,

07:56.177 --> 07:58.202
the screaming crowd.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.942
Robbie, Robbie, Robbie...

08:01.016 --> 08:04.213
Okay, okay, okay. I appreciate
what you all are trying to do, but...

08:04.286 --> 08:06.777
You'll think about it. Fantastic.
That's all I wanted to hear.

08:06.855 --> 08:09.790
And now, I'm leaving
before I hear anything else.

08:09.858 --> 08:14.454
Goodbye, good luck.
Ladies and gentlemen, Marty Klein!

08:16.031 --> 08:20.491
So, you've thought about it, you'll do it,
you'll love me for thinking of it.

08:20.568 --> 08:23.833
Ladies and gentlemen, Miley Stewart!

08:24.706 --> 08:25.866
Come on.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

08:28.109 --> 08:30.373
Even if I was considering singing again,

08:30.445 --> 08:32.970
I'd get up on that stage
and I wouldn't even know what to say.

08:33.048 --> 08:34.345
Oh, I do.

08:35.383 --> 08:37.977
<i>Y'all ready to howl</i>
<i>with the dog?</i>

08:46.795 --> 08:50.094
<i>I want my mullet back</i>

08:50.899 --> 08:54.335
<i>My old Camaro and my eight-track</i>

08:55.337 --> 08:58.932
<i>Fuzzy dice hanging loose and proud</i>

08:59.474 --> 09:03.035
<i>ZZ Top, they're playing loud</i>

09:03.111 --> 09:06.012
You are the meanest man
I have ever met!

09:06.081 --> 09:07.139
Why?

09:07.215 --> 09:09.615
To keep a talent
so incredibly awesome as this

09:09.684 --> 09:12.812
away from a world
that needs you so desperately.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.486
It's just so selfish.

09:16.191 --> 09:18.091
I can't even look at you.

09:21.963 --> 09:25.922
Okay, darling, let's say I was
thinking about singing again.

09:26.301 --> 09:30.533
I can't take you guys with me and I sure
can't leave you home alone for a week.

09:30.605 --> 09:32.436
And you won't have to.

09:32.507 --> 09:35.032
I did a little research,
made a few phone calls,

09:35.110 --> 09:37.943
and I think I came up
with the perfect solution.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.845
May I present, direct from
the International House of Nannies,

09:40.915 --> 09:43.475
the lovely and responsible Inga.

09:48.089 --> 09:49.920
Nice try, Jackson,

09:50.058 --> 09:54.427
but there's no way I can leave this
young lady here alone to nanny you.

09:55.363 --> 09:57.228
You know, I thought you might say that.

09:57.298 --> 09:59.789
Which is why I hired three nannies.

10:03.605 --> 10:07.564
Now, I don't know about you,
but I feel very, very, very nannied.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.671
Ladies, I appreciate you taking
the time to come over here,

10:11.746 --> 10:14.044
but this just isn't gonna work out.

10:18.453 --> 10:20.648
Robbie Ray was huge in Sweden.

10:21.189 --> 10:22.486
Robbie Ray?

10:22.557 --> 10:24.081
Honky-Tonk Heartthrob?

10:24.159 --> 10:25.558
<i> Ja, ja. </i>

10:28.296 --> 10:29.695
One thing.

10:29.831 --> 10:31.492
You only had one thing to get.

10:31.566 --> 10:33.363
Yeah, and I got three.

10:33.435 --> 10:36.199
Forgive me for being an overachiever.

10:36.271 --> 10:38.637
So, ladies, who wants

10:38.706 --> 10:41.573
to go boogie boarding with the son
of the Honky-Tonk Heartthrob?

10:41.643 --> 10:42.905
You betcha.

10:42.977 --> 10:44.205
By golly.

10:44.279 --> 10:45.507
<i> Ja, ja. </i>

10:45.580 --> 10:47.207
Yeah, come on.

10:50.652 --> 10:53.052
Come on, Daddy.
I know you really wanna do this.

10:53.121 --> 10:55.021
Miley, why you pushing so hard?

10:55.089 --> 10:58.024
Because I know the way I feel
when I'm on stage.

10:58.092 --> 11:01.721
I mean, don't you remember
that feeling? Don't you want it again?

11:01.796 --> 11:03.787
- Of course I do, but...
- But nothing.

11:03.865 --> 11:06.197
"But" is just a word you use
when you're afraid to try.

11:06.267 --> 11:07.825
That's something I learned
from my daddy.

11:07.902 --> 11:10.097
Oh, so now you listen to me.

11:11.206 --> 11:12.798
And you should, too.

11:12.874 --> 11:16.241
Okay, if you wanna know the truth,
I did make some calls,

11:16.311 --> 11:19.007
but I just couldn't find anybody I trust
to watch you kids.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.571
So you're saying
if you could find someone, you'd go?

11:21.649 --> 11:24.709
Sure. It would be fun,
but it's just not in the cards.

11:24.786 --> 11:29.780
Well, shuffle them again, Daddy,
and say hello to my backup plan.

11:31.593 --> 11:34.892
Don't worry, hot stuff.
Roxy will take care of everything.

11:34.963 --> 11:37.363
You just go get your mullet back.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.431
Okay, kids, I'll see you
at the end of the week

11:47.509 --> 11:49.807
when you come down for the last show.
Wish me luck.

11:49.878 --> 11:53.143
- Hey, knock them dead, Dad.
- You're gonna do great.

11:56.017 --> 11:57.951
What a beautiful scene.

11:58.820 --> 12:02.586
A man and his children
sharing a heartfelt goodbye.

12:03.558 --> 12:05.822
You know what it reminds me of?

12:05.894 --> 12:08.692
The fact that my car is running
and gas is $3 a gallon!

12:08.763 --> 12:10.196
Let's move!

12:12.066 --> 12:14.694
"Ladies and gentlemen, Marty Klein!"

12:16.738 --> 12:18.933
- Good luck, Dad.
- Bye, Daddy, love you.

12:19.007 --> 12:22.272
Do you believe it? Dad's actually
gonna go out and perform again.

12:22.343 --> 12:24.709
I just wish we didn't have to wait
a whole week to see him.

12:24.779 --> 12:26.644
Yeah, I'm in agony.

12:28.483 --> 12:30.110
And I'm over it.

12:30.718 --> 12:33.585
Oh, Cooper's throwing a party.
Don't wait up.

12:33.655 --> 12:35.020
Oh, can you drop me off at Lilly's?

12:35.089 --> 12:38.115
Slow your roll, children.
Your daddy left me in charge.

12:38.192 --> 12:42.128
And that means, until he gets home,
you're not leaving my sight.

12:43.364 --> 12:45.355
I got my eyes on you.

12:47.368 --> 12:49.529
What exactly does she mean by that?

12:50.238 --> 12:51.671
Good night, kids.

12:51.739 --> 12:53.434
Good night, Roxy.

13:21.102 --> 13:24.560
My eyes may be closed,
but my brain is on red alert.

13:32.680 --> 13:33.840
Hi-ya!

13:45.860 --> 13:47.487
What is going on?

13:48.930 --> 13:51.455
- What time is it?
- 6:00 a. m.

13:51.532 --> 13:53.500
It's time for our morning jog.

13:53.568 --> 13:54.660
Jog?

13:54.736 --> 13:55.794
Mmm-hmm.

13:55.870 --> 13:58.737
Now, let's get on those running shoes
and move, move, move!

13:58.806 --> 14:00.831
You're in Roxy's army now.

14:03.711 --> 14:07.670
Hurry up. Last one down
has to stretch out my hamstrings.

14:12.186 --> 14:14.347
I still can't believe your dad
was up on stage last night.

14:14.422 --> 14:15.946
So, how did it go?

14:18.593 --> 14:19.992
Did he call?

14:21.829 --> 14:23.057
Jackson?

14:35.410 --> 14:37.207
Boy, you're really out.

14:42.917 --> 14:44.976
Don't even think about it.

14:46.821 --> 14:49.119
Roxy was like this all night.

14:50.425 --> 14:51.483
Hi-ya!

14:52.694 --> 14:53.991
Hi-ya!

14:54.562 --> 14:56.723
- Couldn't you just tell her to lighten up?
- Oh, sure.

14:56.798 --> 14:59.392
I tell her to lighten up,
she gets upset, she leaves,

14:59.467 --> 15:02.561
Dad has to come home early,
and once again, I've ruined his dream.

15:02.637 --> 15:03.934
Why are we whispering?

15:04.005 --> 15:06.235
Because Roxy's everywhere.

15:06.307 --> 15:09.105
Because she's got her eyes on me.

15:10.445 --> 15:13.437
Okay, now you're just paranoid.
I don't see her anywhere.

15:13.514 --> 15:16.278
Oh, yeah? Here.
Hit me with this magazine.

15:16.617 --> 15:17.845
What?

15:17.919 --> 15:20.615
Just do it. Trust me, I'll be fine.

15:20.688 --> 15:21.780
Okay.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.096
Roxy's like a puma.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.940
I can't do this anymore.

15:41.809 --> 15:44.437
It's only five more days.
Just do it for Dad.

15:44.512 --> 15:46.605
Okay.
- And shift.

15:49.817 --> 15:52.615
Roxy, I didn't think
that the Marines did yoga.

15:52.687 --> 15:54.518
Oh, I didn't learn this in the Corps.
Mmm-mmm.

15:54.589 --> 15:58.821
I learned it when I was touring India
with world famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma.

15:58.893 --> 16:01.088
He calls me his "Yo-Yo Mama. "

16:02.730 --> 16:05.221
- This hurts.
Oh, it's supposed to.

16:05.299 --> 16:08.996
Feel that negative energy
leaving your body.

16:09.070 --> 16:12.164
Get out all that frustration and anger.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.935
Yeah.

16:14.008 --> 16:16.602
- Mmm. Now, doesn't that feel good?
Uh-huh.

16:16.677 --> 16:19.237
Yeah, in about an hour
you'll be able to do this.

16:22.150 --> 16:24.050
Ooh, I need a pedicure.

16:26.187 --> 16:27.484
Uh, I'll get it.

16:27.555 --> 16:31.821
Yeah, you better. It's gonna take me
a little while to get out of this.

16:35.196 --> 16:37.630
Hey, Jackson. Going to the movies.
Thought you might wanna...

16:37.698 --> 16:40.292
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
- Now where do you think you're going?

16:40.368 --> 16:44.270
To the movies with my friends. Please?

16:44.338 --> 16:46.033
Okay, okay, I get it.

16:46.107 --> 16:48.905
It's Saturday,
you wanna have a good time.

16:48.976 --> 16:50.466
I'm not gonna stop you.

16:50.545 --> 16:52.740
- Really?
- Really. Just let me get my purse.

16:52.814 --> 16:54.805
Miley, come on,
we're going to the movies.

16:54.882 --> 16:56.941
Oh, no. No, no, no. No way.

16:57.018 --> 16:59.748
Uh, Roxy, I'm not really up for a movie.

16:59.821 --> 17:02.381
And besides, I wanna learn that...
The foot thing you just did.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.549
You know, I've always wanted
to bite my own toenails.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.923
Mmm-mmm. I promised your dad
I'd watch both of you,

17:06.993 --> 17:08.757
and both of you is who I'm gonna watch.

17:08.829 --> 17:11.799
- But, I...
- Listen, I just need an aisle seat, okay?

17:11.866 --> 17:15.267
Roxy loves the big drink,
but the big drink don't love Roxy.

17:15.336 --> 17:18.669
Oh, you know what?
We just remembered we got to...

17:18.739 --> 17:21.765
Because, you know...

17:21.843 --> 17:22.935
Bye.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.210
But wait...

17:26.079 --> 17:27.877
I can't believe you just did that.

17:27.949 --> 17:30.281
- I cannot believe...
- You're angry, aren't you?

17:30.351 --> 17:32.342
- Yeah.
- That yoga didn't work for you, did it?

17:32.420 --> 17:33.409
No.

17:33.487 --> 17:37.321
That's because you need some
acupuncture. I'll go get my needles.

17:38.459 --> 17:43.055
That's it. Five days?
I can't take five more minutes of this.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.655
- Jackson, where are you going?
- San Diego.

17:45.733 --> 17:48.327
<i>I want my daddy back</i>

17:48.703 --> 17:49.829
Jackson.

17:51.639 --> 17:54.472
Jackson, you don't think
that I miss him, too?

17:54.542 --> 17:57.443
The way he sings to us in the morning
when he's making us pancakes,

17:57.511 --> 18:00.344
how happy he is
when we come home from school.

18:00.414 --> 18:03.042
No one's called me "Bud" in 48 hours.

18:03.117 --> 18:04.846
Well, that's why I'm going to get him.

18:04.919 --> 18:08.787
But, Jackson, it's not about
what we want. It's about what he wants.

18:08.856 --> 18:10.050
Jackson!

18:11.192 --> 18:12.955
Turn around, girl,
we gotta stop that boy.

18:13.027 --> 18:15.860
- But, Roxy, how did you...
- Look, I just don't have my eyes on you.

18:15.930 --> 18:17.591
I got my ears on you, too.

18:17.665 --> 18:19.292
Let's move. It's a long drive.

18:30.378 --> 18:34.041
<i>I want my mullet back</i>

18:34.448 --> 18:38.282

18:43.190 --> 18:46.887

18:47.194 --> 18:50.891

18:56.203 --> 19:00.003
<i>Things have changed, man</i>
<i>that's a fact</i>

19:00.474 --> 19:04.308
<i>I want my mullet back</i>

19:05.246 --> 19:08.807
- Have you said anything to him yet?
- No, I just got here.

19:09.684 --> 19:12.050
Oh, he's really good.

19:12.153 --> 19:14.644
Are you kidding? He's great.

19:15.122 --> 19:17.590
Quiet. Robbie Ray's got his groove on.

19:17.658 --> 19:19.489
Howl, doggy! Howl!

19:25.800 --> 19:29.327
<i>My old Camaro and my eight-track</i>

19:29.670 --> 19:32.264
Let's go, let the man rest. Go, go, go.

19:33.140 --> 19:34.164
Now.

19:34.241 --> 19:37.870
Hey, guys, what are you doing here?
Everything all right?

19:38.179 --> 19:40.079
Well, the, uh, truth is...

19:41.449 --> 19:42.677
Jackson.

19:42.950 --> 19:45.475
We just couldn't wait to hear you play.

19:45.553 --> 19:47.282
You were so great, Dad.

19:47.355 --> 19:48.879
I'm proud of you.

19:48.956 --> 19:50.355
Thanks, baby, but you know

19:50.424 --> 19:53.518
I would've never have got back up there
if it wasn't for you.

19:53.594 --> 19:55.084
Guess what I just heard?

19:55.162 --> 19:57.221
Toby Keith has a new opening act.

19:57.298 --> 20:00.790
You know who it is?
Don't guess, I'll tell you. It's you.

20:01.335 --> 20:03.997
- Me?
- Six beautiful weeks.

20:04.071 --> 20:07.336
One of which is in, yes, Hawaii.

20:08.376 --> 20:10.810
Ladies and gentlemen, Marty Klein!

20:12.146 --> 20:13.511
Six weeks?

20:13.581 --> 20:15.640
- Wow, that's...
- Awesome.

20:16.117 --> 20:20.554
So incredibly awesome. Really.

20:22.156 --> 20:24.624
They're gonna love you in Hawaii.

20:27.228 --> 20:28.889
Excuse me, Jackson.

20:29.163 --> 20:30.824
Miley, wait up.

20:31.332 --> 20:33.527
You kids sure must love your dad
if you're willing to do

20:33.601 --> 20:35.626
six weeks of Roxy Time.

20:35.970 --> 20:37.301
Six weeks?

20:47.581 --> 20:49.708
Hey, Bud. You all right?

20:49.784 --> 20:52.878
- I'm sorry.
- For what? For crying?

20:53.354 --> 20:55.584
Hey, if you don't want me to go,
just say so.

20:55.656 --> 20:58.784
Daddy, you gave up your whole life
so I could have my dream.

20:58.859 --> 21:01.191
How can I stop you from having yours?

21:01.262 --> 21:03.127
You kids are my dream.

21:03.431 --> 21:05.763
I didn't give up my career
'cause I had to.

21:05.833 --> 21:07.596
I gave it up 'cause I wanted to.

21:07.668 --> 21:09.761
But I saw you up here tonight.

21:09.837 --> 21:11.964
You did so good
and you looked so happy.

21:12.039 --> 21:13.199
I was.

21:13.507 --> 21:16.704
But I was a lot happier when I saw
you kids coming through the door.

21:16.777 --> 21:19.974
So, does that mean you don't want
to do the tour anymore?

21:20.047 --> 21:22.242
Six weeks away from you kids?

21:22.683 --> 21:24.412
I think I'd miss you too much.

21:24.485 --> 21:26.214
We'd miss you, too.

21:28.789 --> 21:32.486
Well, maybe you can just do
the Hawaii part and take us.

21:34.795 --> 21:37.457
Mom, quick,
get the curlers out of your hair!

21:37.531 --> 21:38.964
Robbie Ray is still here!

21:41.268 --> 21:42.667
Too close, candy girl.
