00:10.300 --> 00:12.779
<i>Well, my husband is
always criticising me...</i>

00:12.814 --> 00:16.400
<i>...because in restaurants I like to
listen in on strangers' conversations.</i>

00:16.600 --> 00:19.600
<i>I don't know why he makes
such a big deal out of nothing.</i>

00:20.100 --> 00:22.800
Well June, I suppose...

00:23.100 --> 00:25.856
...your lack of interest makes
your husband feel invisible.

00:25.891 --> 00:27.000
Imagine what it must be like...

00:27.220 --> 00:31.520
...to sit across from someone who's
constantly scanning, searching...

00:31.700 --> 00:33.012
...craning their neck to see...

00:33.047 --> 00:35.800
Just what the hell
is going on out there?

00:35.980 --> 00:38.880
<i>Oh gosh, you're right!
I've been insensitive.</i>

00:39.000 --> 00:39.842
<i>It's just common decency...</i>

00:39.877 --> 00:44.900
<i>-...to stay focused on the
other person.</i> -Huh? What?

00:45.900 --> 00:49.500
-Oh, well, good for you, Jane!
<i>-June!</i> -Oh, yeah, well, whatever!

00:49.720 --> 00:52.920
Er, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
KACL 780.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.400
What is going on?

00:58.600 --> 01:00.573
Oh, our beloved
station manager decided...

01:00.608 --> 01:03.300
-...we're not getting our raise
this year! -What?

01:03.600 --> 01:06.010
This is an outrage!
I have a contract!

01:06.045 --> 01:08.900
Don't palpitate, it doesn't
apply to the on-air talent.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.700
Oh, thank God.

01:19.820 --> 01:22.720
I'm sorry... I was
being selfish, wasn't I?

01:24.180 --> 01:27.180
I, er, feel very ashamed.
It is nevertheless...

01:27.400 --> 01:29.520
...er, an outrage.
It's not a personal outrage...

01:29.555 --> 01:32.200
...but certainly a,
a family of man outrage.

01:32.620 --> 01:35.220
Frasier, I spent that raise already -
on my new diamond earrings!

01:35.390 --> 01:39.290
I love them. I love them
so much, I slept with them!

01:39.500 --> 01:42.036
Well, Roz, as long as
you're doing it for love...

01:42.071 --> 01:44.000
...it's a step in the right direction!

01:45.620 --> 01:49.220
Real supportive, Frasier! We've been
getting that raise every year...

01:49.450 --> 01:53.550
...and now this Nazi in nylons comes
waltzing in here and cancels it...

01:53.800 --> 01:55.048
...with some vague crap about...

01:55.083 --> 01:57.700
...corporate belt-tightening.
This isn't fair!

01:58.820 --> 02:00.038
Oh, oh, actually you're right!

02:00.073 --> 02:03.420
Er you, maybe you should tell
her what you just told me.

02:03.620 --> 02:05.404
Er, except I would leave out
the "Nazi in nylons" bit.

02:05.439 --> 02:08.419
It's not your best icebreaker.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.701
Oh, you're damn right
we're gonna tell her!

02:10.735 --> 02:15.000
-We've all been here a hell of a lot
longer than she has! -That's right!

02:15.200 --> 02:17.800
She pushes us, we push back!

02:19.340 --> 02:23.340
-She's standing right behind me,
isn't she? -Yeah.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.500
Is there a problem? Nope? Good.

02:27.620 --> 02:32.220
Kate? -Doc...? -Er, these people...
would like to speak with you.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.602
No, I'm sorry,
I can't talk right now.

02:34.637 --> 02:37.120
-I've got a meeting.
-Well I-I'm sorry, excuse me?

02:37.360 --> 02:39.267
I think your meeting
can wait five minutes.

02:39.302 --> 02:41.360
Now they're a little upset
about your memo.

02:41.540 --> 02:44.640
-I think you should discuss it with
them. -Dr Crane... I wrote the memo...

02:44.820 --> 02:47.044
I signed the memo,
I posted the memo.

02:47.079 --> 02:49.520
If I had anything more to say,
I would have put it...

02:49.800 --> 02:53.300
-...Anybody?
-In the memo? -Bravo.

02:55.340 --> 02:58.340
Okay. If she wants to play
tough, we'll play tough back.

02:58.550 --> 03:03.050
We still have a lot of power
here. Now we could go on strike...

03:03.760 --> 03:07.060
Look, look, you know er, I,
I think you should listen to Roz.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.038
Every year in exchange
for your hard work...

03:09.073 --> 03:11.220
...you receive a five percent raise.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.816
Now, you've fulfilled
your part of the bargain.

03:12.851 --> 03:14.840
She has blithely changed the deal.

03:15.010 --> 03:18.610
In the 'hood, they
call that "being dissed."

03:18.840 --> 03:22.140
Yes, my streetwise friend.

03:22.520 --> 03:26.320
-You have a right to stand
up for yourselves. -Okay.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.840
We gonna do this? Are we
together? -What's the point?

03:30.020 --> 03:34.220
If we strike they'll just replace us.
They only care about the on-air people.

03:34.510 --> 03:37.710
Aaah, so we'll get their support!
Frasier just said he's on our side!

03:37.860 --> 03:39.960
I did?

03:40.340 --> 03:42.740
Well, well, yes I,
I did, I did, yes. But...

03:42.920 --> 03:44.166
...my meagre endorsement is...

03:44.201 --> 03:46.520
...is meaningless without the
support of the... other talent.

03:46.700 --> 03:50.300
Did you hear that? Frasier's
gonna get everyone on our side!

03:52.340 --> 03:54.460
Er I, I'd love to,
to help, but you know...

03:54.495 --> 03:55.740
I'm already in hot water
with that woman!

03:55.940 --> 03:58.540
You can't ask me to raise
a mutiny against her!

03:58.710 --> 04:03.310
"The needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few or the one."

04:03.460 --> 04:08.260
James Tiberius Kirk,
Captain, Starship Enterprise.

04:11.460 --> 04:14.460
Go away, you annoying little man.

04:14.940 --> 04:16.540
Please?

04:19.579 --> 04:23.280
Oh alright, alright! You organise
your people, I'll talk to mine!

04:25.000 --> 04:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:36.860 --> 04:38.660
Hey, beat it.

04:42.460 --> 04:45.660
Hey, if you can't run with
The Bulldog, stay on the porch.

04:50.860 --> 04:51.917
-Niles.
-Good evening, Frasier.

04:51.952 --> 04:54.460
You left your Mont Blanc
in my car, so I...

04:55.080 --> 04:56.680
Oh.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.580
I see cocktails.
Hors d'oeuvres. Mingling.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.304
If I were the suspicious type...

05:03.339 --> 05:06.360
...I'd say you were throwing
a party to which I was not invited.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.640
-Feel like a wiener, Niles?
-Indeed I do.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.359
Niles, this is not a party.

05:14.394 --> 05:17.440
And dad, that is fourteen-dollar-
a-pound andouille sausage.

05:17.660 --> 05:21.360
Wow. Means Eddie ate
about thirty bucks' worth.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.372
Niles, these people are
colleagues from the station.

05:25.407 --> 05:27.940
We're here to discuss a labour dispute.

05:28.380 --> 05:30.580
Oh, well. Fight on, people!

05:30.760 --> 05:32.310
You know, there is no greater friend...

05:32.345 --> 05:34.060
...to the working man
than my own Maris.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.400
Remember, when our stable
boy Wakim's appendix burst?

05:37.680 --> 05:41.880
She had him driven back to the
border at her own personal expense!

05:43.460 --> 05:47.060
-Ah, good evening, Frasier!
-Gil, Sheryl, Floyd!

05:47.240 --> 05:52.140
Oh! What a stunning apartment!
The palette is pure, subtle elegance!

05:52.370 --> 05:57.070
The detailing... well, it's
inspired! And the furnishings...

05:57.560 --> 06:01.760
Oh, dear. Is that a chair?

06:02.340 --> 06:06.840
-That is my father's chair.
-Oh. Well... this must be your father!

06:07.040 --> 06:09.552
-Hi - Marty Crane.
You put on quite a show!

06:09.587 --> 06:10.940
Oh, you've heard
my little programme?

06:11.140 --> 06:14.140
No, I mean just coming
through the door.

06:16.280 --> 06:19.780
Doc, doc! Can we hurry this thing
up? I got a charity event tonight.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.880
She's not much to look at,
but what the hell.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.580
Okay, well,
since we're all here...

06:26.660 --> 06:29.052
Er, now, regarding management's
claim of financial distress...

06:29.087 --> 06:30.260
I've done some checking around...

06:30.460 --> 06:31.930
...and I've found that
the advertising revenues...

06:31.965 --> 06:35.060
...are up eleven-and-a-half per cent...

06:35.680 --> 06:38.180
-Gil Chesterton, the
restaurant critic! -Yes.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.860
Oh, I just love those wicked things
you say when the food is bad!

06:42.060 --> 06:45.760
Well, keep bringing these and
you won't be disappointed!

06:47.860 --> 06:49.073
The wage freeze is unwarranted.

06:49.108 --> 06:51.760
It is simply a ploy of an
overly ambitious station manager...

06:51.960 --> 06:53.035
...and typical of this woman!

06:53.070 --> 06:55.160
She has terrorised us,
she has tampered with our shows.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.280
-It's time we said no to this Princess
of Darkness! -I got a better idea.

06:59.450 --> 07:03.450
Why don't we just walk up to Mike
Tyson and tell him he talks funny?

07:04.980 --> 07:07.180
What about our support staff?

07:07.400 --> 07:10.024
If we don't back this strike,
they may lose their jobs!

07:10.059 --> 07:11.700
They're powerless without our support.

07:11.850 --> 07:14.450
Frasier, old man,
why do they need raises?

07:14.650 --> 07:18.450
You're talking about people
who eat corn dogs and nachos.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.074
That statement is appallingly elitist.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.200
Well thank you,
Mister Everyday People!

07:26.480 --> 07:29.880
Hey, I'm sure we'd all like to help
these people, but we need our jobs.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.167
We're working stiffs too...

07:31.202 --> 07:33.550
...living from paycheck-to-
paycheck just like they are.

07:33.780 --> 07:37.080
Excuse me, someone's blocking me
in downstairs. Who has a BMW?

07:41.300 --> 07:43.800
A red BMW.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.080
-With a red interior.
-Oh, that's me!

07:47.660 --> 07:49.356
Just give me your key;
I'll leave it to the doorman.

07:49.391 --> 07:52.360
-Oh, no no. I was just leaving.
-Oh, I'm going too.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.459
Where are your ethics?
Where's your conscience?

07:55.494 --> 07:58.400
Where's your john?
I need to slap on some Canoe.

08:00.820 --> 08:03.729
Hey, I'm with you people!
To heck with the workers.

08:03.764 --> 08:06.120
-They're not yours!
-Hey, damn right!

08:06.350 --> 08:10.141
And chances are, after the station
manager crushes the little people...

08:10.176 --> 08:12.050
...she won't come after you big shots.

08:12.250 --> 08:14.850
Right. Why would she...?

08:15.480 --> 08:18.206
Well, I mean er, supposing
she's trying to save money...

08:18.241 --> 08:19.680
...you're the big ticket items.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.554
Erm, after all this, well, she
won't have to worry about...

08:22.589 --> 08:24.880
...the support staff backing
you guys up, will she?

08:25.020 --> 08:27.520
Oh but no, that's crazy.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.419
You're not suggesting that... Kate
might be coming after our money next?

08:31.454 --> 08:32.880
No, she wouldn't do that!

08:33.000 --> 08:35.750
She's a peach, right?
Soft as a cream puff.

08:35.929 --> 08:38.380
And we all know no-one
here is overpaid...

08:38.580 --> 08:41.880
Suddenly, I'm feeling
very Norma Rae.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.273
Great! I'll get us some more wine.

08:44.308 --> 08:46.500
Dad, that was brilliant,
using reverse psychology!

08:46.620 --> 08:50.100
I guess living with me is
rubbing off on you a little bit.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.262
Well, I guess it's only natural
that environmental factors...

08:53.297 --> 08:56.300
-...would influence personality
development... -Alright.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.416
Well, oh wait I, I hope I didn't hit...

08:58.451 --> 09:01.480
-...some long-repressed
Oedipal nerve... -Very funny.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.542
Because the last thing
we want is for you...

09:03.577 --> 09:05.680
...to be sublimating your
anger passive/aggressive...

09:05.880 --> 09:07.791
Oh, alright!
Just stop it, you wise ass!

09:07.826 --> 09:11.080
Ha-hey! Looks like I'm
rubbing off on you, too!

09:18.320 --> 09:20.433
Alright, people! I have spoken...

09:20.468 --> 09:22.420
-...with the on-air talent, and I...
-Shhh!

09:22.670 --> 09:25.270
Ixnay, Dr Crane...

09:30.300 --> 09:34.700
Ah, yes. You've really dropped
the cone of silence now.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.400
Anyway, I have delivered on my
promise: the talent is behind you.

09:40.540 --> 09:43.640
If you strike, we strike.
All for one and one for all!

09:44.420 --> 09:48.520
-Okay! So who is our spokesperson -
who is leading the charge? -I am.

09:48.750 --> 09:52.850
-You want to make something of it?
Oh shoot, I smiled again!

09:55.420 --> 09:58.220
Rozalinda, a word.

10:02.820 --> 10:04.562
Our leader is Noel Shempsky?!

10:04.597 --> 10:07.020
The man has all the
backbone of a paramecium!

10:07.900 --> 10:09.711
Well, do you think that it's my idea?

10:09.746 --> 10:12.100
Noel and I were the
only two who volunteered.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.555
'Course, they voted me down.

10:13.590 --> 10:16.550
I'm smarter than he is,
more confident, more articulate...

10:16.760 --> 10:20.860
...but those stupid little
wusses think I'm a hot-head!

10:21.220 --> 10:23.277
But Noel, Roz!

10:23.312 --> 10:26.220
A lot of people's jobs are riding
on this - including mine!

10:26.420 --> 10:29.186
-Then you do it! -Me?
-Yes! -No no, me? -Oh, please!

10:29.221 --> 10:31.420
Me? No, no, I've done
enough already, oh...

10:31.640 --> 10:33.434
Dr Crane, I can see
that you're concerned...

10:33.469 --> 10:36.340
...about my negotiating skills.
But don't be...

10:36.520 --> 10:39.220
I have a secret weapon.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.640
I can faint at will.
Check it out...

10:49.160 --> 10:53.060
Okay people, there's been a coup.
I am now your leader!

10:53.960 --> 10:57.160
To the lair of the She-Wolf!

11:04.320 --> 11:06.402
Wow. What have we here?

11:06.437 --> 11:08.720
We are dissatisfied
with the wage freeze...

11:08.900 --> 11:11.500
...and we demand to
speak to you about it.

11:11.700 --> 11:14.200
-Don't we?
-Yes!

11:14.820 --> 11:18.420
Alright, but aren't you people
still on the clock?

11:23.340 --> 11:27.940
Well hi-ho the dairy-o,
the cheese stands alone.

11:29.040 --> 11:33.640
They're a shrewd group. They only flex
their muscles when they have to.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.520
Well done!

11:37.220 --> 11:39.520
Yeah, right.
Will you get in here?

11:42.220 --> 11:45.920
I'm kinda surprised to see you here.
This really isn't your fight, is it?

11:46.040 --> 11:49.740
I am honoured to have been chosen
by my colleagues to speak for them.

11:49.960 --> 11:50.817
Oh. That's a shame.

11:50.852 --> 11:54.460
I was kinda looking forward
to seeing Shempsky faint.

11:55.740 --> 11:58.940
Well, we have a lot to do,
so we may as well just get to it...

11:59.350 --> 12:02.350
Is that a, a new hairdo?
It's very fetching.

12:02.940 --> 12:06.440
Oooh, is that a new tie?
It just lights up your pretty face.

12:08.940 --> 12:09.931
Look, what is it about us?

12:09.966 --> 12:12.940
I mean, why all this friction
between us? For my own part...

12:13.140 --> 12:16.340
...your intolerable
smugness reminds me of my ex-wife.

12:16.540 --> 12:19.340
But... what is the source
of your antipathy toward me?

12:19.540 --> 12:22.772
Was there some intimidating male
figure in your childhood?

12:22.807 --> 12:24.640
A father? A, a priest?

12:24.840 --> 12:28.640
A department store Santa... I
don't know, I'm just spit-balling here!

12:28.960 --> 12:35.060
-I have an idea about the source of our
antagonism. -Good. Do let me hear it.

12:35.740 --> 12:41.740
I'm a woman, I'm as smart as you,
and I'm your boss. -Coincidences, all!

12:42.440 --> 12:44.788
Doc... I don't want to
analyse your hang-ups.

12:44.823 --> 12:47.140
I already got a full-time job.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.917
Let's just get down to business, okay?

12:48.952 --> 12:51.860
Oh, very well. There's really
very little to discuss.

12:52.140 --> 12:54.331
These people were promised
a raise. They have fulfilled...

12:54.366 --> 12:56.440
...their part of the bargain;
it's time for you to honour yours.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.760
-You have twenty-four hours.
-Or?

12:58.910 --> 13:01.781
We walk, en masse.
Including the on-air talent.

13:01.816 --> 13:03.510
-I've seen to that myself.
-You have.

13:05.660 --> 13:09.560
-Why are you gunning for me?
-Gunning? For you?

13:09.740 --> 13:12.130
This isn't about you, it's about what
you're doing to those people.

13:12.165 --> 13:13.740
It's the shame of Seattle!

13:13.860 --> 13:18.360
No, no; this is about your ego,
which is the size of Seattle!

13:18.680 --> 13:21.039
Every suggestion,
every decision I've made...

13:21.074 --> 13:23.080
...has been met by
this impenetrable wall...

13:23.280 --> 13:26.580
...of arrogance masquerading
as righteousness.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.122
That's a desperate shot...

13:28.157 --> 13:29.960
...attacking me because
I have a social conscience!

13:30.110 --> 13:33.610
No, what you have is a fat contract,
and so do the rest of your cronies.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.359
So when it came time
for staff raises...

13:35.394 --> 13:37.480
...there was no more
money left in the till!

13:37.730 --> 13:41.130
Oh, you are twisting things to
make it look like it's my fault!

13:41.380 --> 13:45.280
Oh, it's true what they say: the devil
comes disguised as a beautiful woman!

13:47.140 --> 13:48.250
There would've been raises...

13:48.285 --> 13:51.340
...if you hadn't taken all the
money to pay for those Armani suits.

13:51.560 --> 13:52.597
Oh, oh, what about you?

13:52.632 --> 13:56.060
Let's not overlook that pricey
little Fendi scarf you're wearing!

13:56.200 --> 13:58.222
Well, what about this
designer cologne on you?

13:58.257 --> 14:00.300
Well, how about those
pouty lips that must have...

14:00.460 --> 14:03.260
-...cost you a fortune in collagen
injections! -These lips are mine...

14:03.480 --> 14:06.480
-...you arrogant gasbag!
-You intractable despot!

14:06.650 --> 14:09.550
-Blowhard! -Tyrant!
-Ass! -Shrew!

14:15.160 --> 14:17.460
Get out...!

14:19.660 --> 14:21.460
Now!

14:33.140 --> 14:36.340
-Hey, Niles!
-Maris found a grey hair.

14:37.280 --> 14:40.080
Daphne, get Niles a brandy.

14:40.460 --> 14:42.381
It was right at the apex
of her widow's peak.

14:42.416 --> 14:44.560
Better bring the bottle!

14:44.860 --> 14:47.320
She blames me, dad. She said...

14:47.355 --> 14:49.860
...it's from the stress
I caused her last night when I...

14:50.140 --> 14:53.640
...thoughtlessly turned on the light
while she was getting undressed.

14:57.860 --> 14:59.960
Oh! Good evening, Dr Crane!

15:00.160 --> 15:01.362
Oh, let me take that for you.

15:01.397 --> 15:04.960
After all, you are the
friend of the working man!

15:05.180 --> 15:06.171
Thank you, Daphne.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.480
-Defender of the little people...
-Alright, Daphne...

15:08.660 --> 15:11.170
Standing up to the boss
on behalf of the downtrodden...

15:11.205 --> 15:12.860
...selflessly risking your own...

15:12.990 --> 15:15.790
Don't you have
some meat to boil?

15:17.980 --> 15:22.480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I apologise,
it's just been a, a, a bad day.

15:23.180 --> 15:28.480
I was elected by the employees to
present our demands to, to Kate.

15:28.980 --> 15:33.180
Oh well, that was a smart move!
Did you give her a good tongue-lashing?

15:39.700 --> 15:44.100
-In a manner of speaking, yes.
-I'm proud of you, son.

15:44.460 --> 15:48.260
No, don't be, dad - I'm a fraud.

15:48.480 --> 15:52.380
...I, I was in her office...
tempers flared and...

15:53.500 --> 15:56.700
...the next thing I knew,
we were......locked in a...

15:56.870 --> 16:00.270
-...passionate kiss!
-Ooooh, go on!

16:01.500 --> 16:04.400
Daphne, I'm really not that comfortable
talking about this in front of you.

16:04.580 --> 16:08.580
Oh, no need to be shy around me.
I'm a professional health care worker!

16:08.780 --> 16:11.756
I've seen it all! I've helped your
father in and out of the bathtub.

16:11.791 --> 16:13.080
Okay, Daphne...

16:13.660 --> 16:16.207
-I've seen his bits!
-Hey! Oh, for God's sake!

16:16.242 --> 16:19.060
Just tell her, will you?

16:19.200 --> 16:23.000
Frasier: Oh, alright. It was like
nothing I've ever experienced before.

16:23.220 --> 16:29.020
It was just... pure sex!
Overwhelming, unexpected, animal-like!

16:29.180 --> 16:32.780
Oh well, that! We've all experienced
that, who hasn't? Pfff!

16:36.800 --> 16:39.200
I'm no stranger to
that feeling meself.

16:39.410 --> 16:43.310
It can strike without warning.
And you don't know who it will be!

16:43.600 --> 16:46.800
Why, you could be standing next
to a person month after month...

16:47.000 --> 16:48.125
...and then the
next thing you know...

16:48.160 --> 16:50.800
...you're tearing
each other's clothes off!

16:51.500 --> 16:54.900
-There's a word for it...
-Hope.

16:56.800 --> 17:00.096
Oh, this is madness! I'm
actually lusting after a woman...

17:00.131 --> 17:03.400
...that does nothing but grate
on my nerves. I can't stand her!

17:03.550 --> 17:06.163
Oh really, Dr Crane! Would
a man want to have sex...

17:06.198 --> 17:07.550
...with a woman he doesn't even like?

17:07.700 --> 17:09.800
-Yes!
-Absolutely!

17:11.420 --> 17:16.420
Maybe she's been harbouring
feelings for me.

17:17.099 --> 17:19.714
Is it possible that she could have
been lusting after me all this time?

17:19.749 --> 17:21.800
Oh, it could be. But...

17:22.020 --> 17:24.018
...you know, you were in
the middle of a negotiation.

17:24.053 --> 17:27.020
Maybe she laid that smackeroo
on you just to rattle your brain.

17:27.220 --> 17:31.820
Dad has a point. Your musk-drenched
animal magnetism aside...

17:32.020 --> 17:34.123
...it's quite possible that she
was simply manipulating you.

17:34.158 --> 17:36.620
Oh, I hardly think so.

17:36.820 --> 17:39.820
The woman's passion...
seemed genuine.

17:40.020 --> 17:43.120
Yes - it always does.

17:44.500 --> 17:48.400
Do you suppose it's possible she's
just using sex to sway me to her side?

17:48.600 --> 17:51.000
Well, figure it out. Who made
the first move? You or her?

17:51.170 --> 17:54.470
There was no first move. It was more
like spontaneous sexual combustion.

17:54.640 --> 17:58.040
-There's always a first
move. Think. -Alright.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.409
I was standing in front
of her desk like so.

18:01.444 --> 18:03.400
She was facing me...
Niles, you be Kate.

18:03.530 --> 18:06.030
-I will not.
-Look, just stand up!

18:06.200 --> 18:10.300
I'm always the girl! In every
prep school play I was the girl!

18:10.900 --> 18:13.500
Guinevere, Marian the Librarian,
Ado Annie. Well, no more.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.431
I'm through with it!

18:14.466 --> 18:17.370
When do I get to be
Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo'?!

18:17.500 --> 18:19.362
This is getting menowhere!
Alright.

18:19.397 --> 18:22.900
I'll just have to go down there
and confront her myself.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.880
Find out if what she was feeling
was actually genuine or...

18:27.080 --> 18:29.728
...she was simply being
a conniving femme fatale!

18:29.763 --> 18:31.280
Oh, come on now, Dr Crane!

18:31.440 --> 18:34.340
It's not like men have never
used sex to get what they want.

18:34.470 --> 18:37.720
How can we possibly use sex
to get what we want?!

18:37.860 --> 18:41.360
Sex is what we want!

18:57.700 --> 18:59.940
-Kate.
-Frasier.

19:01.420 --> 19:05.620
-Er... I think we have some issues
to discuss. -Me too. Have a seat.

19:05.820 --> 19:08.820
-I'd prefer to stand.
-Me too.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.720
-Let's talk about the kiss.
-Yeah. Let's. -Alright.

19:12.900 --> 19:15.900
Why did it happen?
Some possibilities:

19:16.320 --> 19:20.920
Er, frustration; passion;
the stress of the situation;

19:22.100 --> 19:25.900
-Manipulation.
-Manipulation...

19:26.140 --> 19:29.179
That is interesting.
-What's interesting is that...

19:29.214 --> 19:31.040
...you focused on manipulation. Why...?

19:31.220 --> 19:34.620
-Because there's a possibility
of manipulation. -So, you admit...

19:34.800 --> 19:37.700
-...that you were manipulating me!
-Me? I'm talking about you!

19:37.820 --> 19:40.220
How dare you think
I'd do a thing like that!

19:40.320 --> 19:41.814
Well, it's not unheard of
for a woman like you...

19:41.849 --> 19:44.720
...to use her feminine wiles
to get what she wants.

19:44.940 --> 19:46.738
Oh, very clever!
What about you using your...

19:46.773 --> 19:49.140
...masculine wiles to
get what you want?

19:50.020 --> 19:51.567
You think my wiles are masculine?

19:51.602 --> 19:55.920
No, I am not going down
that road again.

19:56.740 --> 20:00.240
'Course you're not. Because
at the end of that road...

20:00.460 --> 20:05.760
...is a cul-de-sac of vulnerability.
That's not you, is it?

20:06.020 --> 20:11.220
-No, you're cement-hard.
-"Cul-de-sac of vulnerability"?

20:12.840 --> 20:15.735
Alright, listen. You see me for a
couple of hours out of every day...

20:15.770 --> 20:19.240
...and you think you
know me? The me me?

20:19.590 --> 20:24.090
Alright, I can be tough - okay,
I've gotta be. I can also be tender...

20:24.320 --> 20:28.520
...spontaneous...
shy... lusty...

20:28.820 --> 20:32.120
-...playful.
-Kittenish?

20:33.890 --> 20:36.690
I could climb you
like a scratching post.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.060
Damn it!

20:41.940 --> 20:45.340
Stop! What are we doing?!

20:46.940 --> 20:48.638
Now... there are people out
there counting on us!

20:48.673 --> 20:49.740
Right, you're absolutely right.

20:49.940 --> 20:53.140
We've gotta put personal pleasure
aside until we get this thing resolved.

20:53.260 --> 20:54.313
Absolutely. We owe it to them.

20:54.348 --> 20:57.160
If it takes every minute of
every hour of every day...

20:57.340 --> 20:58.809
...and every ounce of
strength we have...

20:58.844 --> 21:01.340
...we have got to settle
this strike! Alright.

21:01.540 --> 21:04.040
Those people deserve
a five percent raise.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.000
-I'll give you three.
-Four! -Done.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.220
-Hey, any news?
-Frasier's hanging tough!

21:16.420 --> 21:20.020
-He just keeps pounding that desk
and saying, "More, more, more!" -Okay!

21:30.640 --> 21:32.240
Good news.

21:32.440 --> 21:37.340
-She's offered three percent.
-Take it! -No, never!

21:37.940 --> 21:42.240
I'm going to get you four! I don't care
if I have to stay in there all night!

21:45.040 --> 21:47.240
Frasier! Frasier! Frasier!
