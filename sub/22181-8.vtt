[thunder rumbling]

00:44.312 --> 00:45.746
Hey, Doc,

00:45.779 --> 00:47.481
you really think
you can make
that thing work?

00:47.515 --> 00:48.749
We need to make it work

00:48.782 --> 00:52.120
if we're ever gonna bring hope
back to this darkened world.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.088
[arrows whooshing]

01:08.702 --> 01:11.205
[grunting]

01:26.920 --> 01:29.190
[man 1] You're the best
they could send?

01:30.924 --> 01:33.661
[man 2] Funny,
I was gonna say the same thing.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.599
[neck cracking]

01:41.602 --> 01:44.172
[metal clashing]

[groaning]

02:19.973 --> 02:21.775
[panting]

02:22.876 --> 02:24.578
There are more like me,

02:25.579 --> 02:28.616
and one day
they will free this world.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.719
[man 1] That day may come,
but you won't be here
to see it.

02:33.421 --> 02:36.424
That flag died a long time ago.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.292
Well, it still means something.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.396
[man 1] Yeah.
It's a bull's-eye.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.793
With this, my reign
will last for eternity.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.378
[siren wailing]

03:31.345 --> 03:33.314
[tires screeching]

03:33.347 --> 03:34.815
[Iris West] Barry,
we have a major problem.

03:35.383 --> 03:35.983
Yep.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.318
Fighting it right now.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.819
No, no, it's about our wedding.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.020
[creature growling]

03:40.053 --> 03:41.855

the best time.

[grunts]

03:50.531 --> 03:51.665
[yelling]

03:51.699 --> 03:54.502
Well, the caterers need
a final count tomorrow morning

03:54.535 --> 03:56.437
and not everyone has
RSVP'd yet.

03:57.805 --> 03:58.972
[panting]

03:59.006 --> 04:01.775
Who hasn't RSVP'd?

04:01.809 --> 04:03.444
[Felicity over radio]
Hey, Oliver,
we gotta talk.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.547
Earth to Oliver.

[crashing]

04:09.950 --> 04:11.452
[all grunting]

04:11.985 --> 04:14.288
I'm a little busy

04:14.322 --> 04:15.823
right now.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.292
Well, it's not like
you're dealing with
Damien Darhk,

04:18.326 --> 04:19.627
I mean, these are
just some ninjas.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.796
[Oliver] If you were here,
you might have a
little more respect

04:22.830 --> 04:24.365
for "just some ninjas".

04:25.032 --> 04:26.334
Okay, this is serious.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.836
Barry and Iris need to know
if we're going to
their wedding.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.371
[all grunting]

04:31.805 --> 04:33.374
Of course we're going.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.410
Okay, so I'll RSVP yes, then?

04:39.713 --> 04:42.350
-Barring further ninjas.
-Perfect.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.722
[horse neighing]

04:53.461 --> 04:56.029
[man] Please, sir,
alms for the poor?

04:56.063 --> 04:57.998
Out of the way, old man.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.334
Royal business in Nottingham.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.470
It'll be your neck
if we're late.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.640
It's Robin Hood!

05:08.409 --> 05:09.643
Not quite.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.480
[men screaming]

05:15.483 --> 05:16.784
-[Professor Stein] Oh, dear.
-[Sara] Hey, guys,

05:16.817 --> 05:20.688
did we RSVP
for Iris and Barry's wedding?

05:20.721 --> 05:23.624
[grunting]
We definitely did not.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.893
Then that's a serious
breech of courtesy.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.698
Weddings are the worst.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.041
All right, team, let's go!

05:41.074 --> 05:43.677
We got a wedding to
prepare for!

05:47.515 --> 05:48.482
[man] Wrong answer.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.384
When I tell you
to get someone on the phone,

05:50.418 --> 05:52.486
that doesn't mean five minutes,

05:52.520 --> 05:53.921
that means right now.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.924
I don't care if they're busy,
you make it happen.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.693
Otherwise, you're not gonna
be able to afford a phone.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.795
-[car alarm chirps]
-[crashing]

06:03.831 --> 06:05.499
My car!

06:05.533 --> 06:07.034
I'm scrambling a strike team.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.268
There's no time,
she's on her own.

06:08.301 --> 06:11.071
Supergirl, identify the threat
so we can help you fight it.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.074
Whatever it is,
it came out of deep orbit
and it is mad.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.444
-So it's alien?
-Well, it's definitely
not NASA.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.512
-Is it Czarnian?
-Or Hellgrammite.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.013
[Supergirl grunts]

06:20.047 --> 06:21.682

[Supergirl grunts]

06:41.569 --> 06:43.704
These guys are so last year.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.845
I heard there was a fight.
Is Kara okay?

06:52.713 --> 06:54.882
Fine. She's Supergirl.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.120
So, Mon-El just showed up
like nothing was wrong?

07:00.153 --> 07:02.890
I think he was just trying
to make things seem normal.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.158
Normal? The man I love,

07:05.192 --> 07:07.995
and thought was dead, is alive.

07:08.028 --> 07:11.231
And every night I'd make up
all these scenarios of how
I'd see him again

07:11.264 --> 07:15.769
and now he's actually here,
but, guess what? He's married.

07:15.803 --> 07:16.704
[sighs]

07:16.737 --> 07:18.906
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't be complaining.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.775
I know you're still dealing
with the pain of Maggie.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.544
At least, we have each other.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.013
And misery loves company.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.180
God, that's depressing.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.315
[Alex] Mmm-hmm.

07:28.348 --> 07:31.018
Yep. And on that note,
I'm gonna get another drink.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.661
Hey.

07:41.929 --> 07:42.930
What's this?

07:43.831 --> 07:46.199
-Oh, wedding invitation.
-"Barry Allen."

07:46.233 --> 07:48.235
As in, wait, the Flash,
Barry Allen?

07:48.268 --> 07:50.137
The one and only.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.171
Oh. When is it?

07:52.239 --> 07:53.674
Tomorrow, I guess.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.908
-Are you going?
-Do I look like

07:54.942 --> 07:57.911
the kind of person that's
in the mood to go to a wedding?

07:57.945 --> 08:00.681
Besides, I'm not
the only one on
that invitation.

08:00.714 --> 08:04.685
You're right.
This is not a time
for us to go out

08:04.718 --> 08:07.087
or have any fun,
this is our time

08:07.120 --> 08:12.860
to wallow, to drown
our sorrows, and put on
breakup weight.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.161
No.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.363
I was just kidding.

08:16.396 --> 08:18.098
I know that you're incapable
of putting on weight.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.232
Which I totally resent.

08:19.266 --> 08:24.772
I mean, we are not going to
just sit here and wallow.

08:24.805 --> 08:29.176
We are going to get ourselves
out of this funk

08:29.209 --> 08:31.912
and off of this couch,

08:31.945 --> 08:35.115
and we're going to get
our mojo back.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.684
What? Wait, what are we doing?

08:36.717 --> 08:37.885
[device beeps]

08:40.287 --> 08:41.789
We're going to that wedding.

08:56.136 --> 08:59.339
Iris, you are really glowing.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.440
Aw.

09:00.473 --> 09:03.711
Wait, it's pregnant women
who glow, brides blush.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.746
Right. Blushing bride I can do,

09:05.779 --> 09:07.881
the other one, not just yet.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.249
Oh, It doesn't get
better than this, ladies.

09:09.282 --> 09:13.353
I know. It feels so good
to just be away from it all.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.122
-Everything.
-Where's Mon-El?

09:15.155 --> 09:16.624
[sighs]

09:16.657 --> 09:18.158
You know what?
It's a long story,

09:18.191 --> 09:21.294
but thank you for letting me
bring my sister as my plus-one.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.997
Yeah. Absolutely. I'm actually
really excited to meet her.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.265
-Me, too.
-[electricity crackling]

09:25.298 --> 09:27.000
-[woman gasps]
-[gasps] Uh...

09:27.034 --> 09:30.671
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should have warned you.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.140
I take a lot of keratin.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.844
-Super strong nails.
-So, um,

09:36.877 --> 09:39.747
you and Oliver?
You guys next, you think,

09:39.780 --> 09:40.714
to walk down the aisle?

09:40.748 --> 09:42.382
Maybe once the city
is not being attacked

09:42.415 --> 09:43.884
and Oliver
is no longer under indictment

09:43.917 --> 09:44.918
and he's spent
enough time with his son

09:44.952 --> 09:46.654
who is still mourning
the loss of his mother.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.656
-So, any day now.
-Any day now.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.123
[chuckles]

09:50.157 --> 09:52.626
Well, cheers, Iris,
to your big day.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.361
-To your big day.
-[all] Cheers.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.896
-Thanks, girls.
-Cheers to you.

09:58.966 --> 10:02.035
You know, I mean,
I've been in love with Iris
since I was ten.

10:02.069 --> 10:05.639
How am I supposed to fit
all that love into one vow?

10:05.673 --> 10:07.908
I've already written
38 pages, single spaced.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.342
[Oliver] You could
always speed-read it.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.945
No, no one would understand me.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.914
I don't know what to do,
man, I need help.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.650
Barry, when you're up there,

10:16.684 --> 10:18.719
-and you look into her eyes...
-Damn.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.087
...the words will come.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.554
And if they don't,

10:21.588 --> 10:24.792
the look on your face
will tell her everything that
she needs to know.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.128
You clean up nice, my friend.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.731
[chuckles] Thanks.
Yeah, you, too.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.232
I can't believe
you're really doing this.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.333
Yeah, man.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.035
What can I say, I got the girl.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.870
And, so did you.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.806
You ever think
about making it official?

10:39.272 --> 10:40.808
Again? Yeah.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.010
Um...

10:43.043 --> 10:44.745
I think that with everything
going on right now,

10:44.778 --> 10:47.147
it's just not the right time.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.784
-You love her?
-I love her so much.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.286
Put a ring on her.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.757
People like us are always
going to be getting
into trouble, right?

10:56.790 --> 10:57.991
Having someone we love
by our side

10:58.025 --> 11:00.293
just makes getting out
of that trouble
that much easier.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.995
We have something to fight for.

11:02.029 --> 11:02.996
[sighs]

11:03.030 --> 11:05.432
If I can have
my happy ending,
so can you.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.867
I promise.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.305
I'm supposed to be
the all-knowing mentor.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.808
I have been known to catch up.

11:17.811 --> 11:18.979
What's wrong?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.815
You didn't react to my joke.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.250
Oh.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.384
That's fine, he got it.

11:27.821 --> 11:31.391
I call it,
"The calm after the Firestorm."

11:31.424 --> 11:32.425
[Jax] What is it?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.828
[Harrison] It's efficient
decelerating serum.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.496
[stammers] It's a cure?

11:36.529 --> 11:39.166
We've spent months
trying to devise a solution

11:39.199 --> 11:40.934
to neutralize the
Firestorm matrix.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.103
Uh, separate ourselves
without blowing up.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.671
Or switching bodies.
We read your notes.

11:44.704 --> 11:48.208
Although, why you wouldn't
want to switch bodies with him
is beyond me.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.110
What Squidward here
means to say is,

11:50.143 --> 11:53.814
we took the data you
extrapolated from Newton and
Curie and Galileo...

11:53.847 --> 11:55.248
Hacks, every one of them.

11:55.282 --> 11:59.019
...and we ran it through
a Conway class
nucleo-dynamic synthesizer.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.522
Hold your applause,
I only built it myself.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.157
[Harrison] First off,
nobody was clapping.

12:04.191 --> 12:07.427
Second, that explains
why it couldn't splice a proton
for a neutrino field.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.863
I'll splice the proton
from your neutrino field.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.132
"Fields." I've got
a million fields.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.034
Really? Are all your fields
this unbearable?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.936
Gentlemen,
we appreciate your efforts,

12:15.969 --> 12:18.471
but how do you account
for the destabilization

12:18.505 --> 12:19.873
of the Firestorm matrix?

12:19.907 --> 12:21.274
-We trick it.
-We trick it.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.743
Quark spheres.

12:23.777 --> 12:27.147
They'll convince the matrix
that our genetic codes
are connected,

12:27.180 --> 12:30.050
when, in actuality,
they're not.
That's genius.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.085
And, you're sure this'll work?

12:32.119 --> 12:33.887
No powers for either of us?

12:33.921 --> 12:36.123
Guaranteed to put out
the fire in Firestorm.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.257
[Harrison]
One of you takes it...

12:37.290 --> 12:38.792
[Cisco] Boom.
You're back to your
old selves.

12:38.826 --> 12:39.993
No offense.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.264
Uh, just to be safe,
I'd like to have
Gideon run some tests,

12:44.297 --> 12:45.298
calculate dosage.

12:45.332 --> 12:48.468
We could take this
directly after the ceremony.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.204
[stammers] I can't wait to tell
Clarissa and Lily

12:51.238 --> 12:52.806
that I'm finally coming home.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.908
This is fantastic news,
isn't it?

12:54.942 --> 12:58.278
Yeah, it's great.
It's everything we wanted,
so thanks, guys.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.980
-You're welcome.
-You're welcome.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.486
[thunder cracking]

13:07.988 --> 13:10.123
[tense music playing]

13:19.967 --> 13:21.501
Hail victory!

13:21.534 --> 13:22.970
[all] Hail Fuhrer!

13:28.241 --> 13:30.944
The rebels' technology
is impressive.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.513
It's a good thing
you stopped them when you did.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.482
-Can you make it work?
-Yes.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.619
But I need time to test it.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.488
To ensure they
haven't set a trap.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.124
[wind whooshing]

13:47.127 --> 13:49.029
[woman] You have one day.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.200
You heard her.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.043
[knocking on door]

14:03.076 --> 14:04.511
Almost time for
the rehearsal dinner.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.280
Of course. I was just finishing
up some personal work.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.549
Come in, my dear.
How are you doing?

14:10.317 --> 14:11.318
I'm okay.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.925
Yes, the last wedding
we attended together...

14:17.958 --> 14:19.192
Was mine.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.062
Ronnie was such a great man.

14:22.095 --> 14:25.232
I should know.
I might have spent more time
with him than you did.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.134
-He was the best.
-Hmm.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.402
I think he'd be
so happy for you, though.

14:29.436 --> 14:33.006
You know Cisco and Wells
needed my help to come up
with that cure, right?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.641
Of course, my darling.

14:34.674 --> 14:37.945
Caitlin, I saw your
brilliance written all over it.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.179
[Caitlin chuckles]

14:39.212 --> 14:41.448
So what will you do
when you're
no longer Firestorm?

14:43.050 --> 14:44.451
Be a better husband, I hope.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.353
And father.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.422
There's a project
I promised Lily
we would work on together.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.691
And, most importantly,

14:51.724 --> 14:54.461
I'll be spending time
with my grandson.

14:54.494 --> 14:58.165
I plan to regale him
with thousands
of bedtime stories

14:58.198 --> 15:01.534
from all my adventures,
and I intend to
teach him chess.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.070
That sounds lovely.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.737
We better get going.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.640
Joe said that he'd lock up
anyone who missed his speech.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.709
Oh. You better run along.
[kisses]

15:09.742 --> 15:11.244
-I'll be right with you.
-Okay.

15:28.661 --> 15:33.433
* I will always
Come back to you *

15:33.466 --> 15:38.205
* Even in the mean time
I will always standby *

15:38.238 --> 15:40.473
* A mirror on the shelf

15:42.742 --> 15:45.245
* Call you in the night time

15:45.278 --> 15:47.147
* Call you in the day time

15:47.180 --> 15:49.682
* Canvas up to you

15:53.320 --> 15:54.988
I never pegged you
as a wedding guy.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.623
I never pass up
on a free buffet.

15:57.724 --> 15:58.725
Or an open bar.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.132
Sorry, didn't I try
and kidnap you, once?

16:05.165 --> 16:07.367
Yes. And I wouldn't
try that again.

16:14.041 --> 16:18.111
Somebody who drinks
like that is looking to make
something go away.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.013
Yeah, well... [clears throat]

16:20.047 --> 16:23.483
And what are you
looking to make go away?

16:23.516 --> 16:27.287
Nothing. I just like
the taste of scotch.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.422
[smacks lips]
Fair enough.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.759
I just called off
my engagement.

16:32.792 --> 16:36.029
-Ooh.
-Yeah. So being here...

16:36.063 --> 16:37.364
Really brings up a lot.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.665
What, did you
catch him cheating?

16:38.698 --> 16:40.100
Uh-uh.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.434
Her.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.469
[chuckles]

16:42.502 --> 16:43.436
It wasn't anything like that.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.739
We just wanted
different things, you know?

16:46.773 --> 16:48.341
Wish I had realized
that sooner.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.577
Had to make a break for it
before later came around.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.011
So, let me guess,

16:52.045 --> 16:55.182
being at the rehearsal dinner
for the world's most
perfect couple

16:55.215 --> 16:57.184
is probably
the last place that
you wanna be.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.618
It stings a little, yeah.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.521
To making things go away.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.756
-[glasses clinking]
-And loving
the taste of scotch.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.601
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.136
[both chuckle]

17:16.169 --> 17:18.071
This is really nice.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.240
-Thanks for having us.
-Of course.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.708
Um, actually, I wanted
to ask you for a favor.

17:21.741 --> 17:25.612
By the way, your sister
seems to be tipping the elbow
pretty heavy.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.214
[Kara] Oh, that's fine.
[Barry] Oh.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.216
[Kara] No one can drink Alex
under a table.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.751
She's just had
a rough go of it lately.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.621
She's not the only one,
I'm guessing.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.090
I just noticed you don't have
your plus-one with you.

17:37.124 --> 17:40.393
Oh, I am pluses zero
these days.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.529
Sorry.
What happened with Mon-El?

17:43.830 --> 17:46.399
What didn't happen? [scoffs]

17:46.433 --> 17:48.401
-The end of the world.
-Faced that three times.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.103
-Time travel.
-I've been there, a lot.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.571
He's married to someone else.

17:51.604 --> 17:52.772
Uh-oh.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.309
That's...

17:56.343 --> 17:58.145
I've got nothing for that.
I'm sorry.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.446
I mean, it's my own fault.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.449
I keep forgetting that my life
should only be
about Supergirl,

18:02.482 --> 18:07.220
but then, you know,
life keeps finding a way
to remind me.

18:07.254 --> 18:10.657
I finally got Oliver to admit
it's okay to have
love in his life,

18:10.690 --> 18:11.824
now I've got to
convince you, too?

18:11.858 --> 18:14.161
Barry, it's different
for you guys, you're human.

18:14.194 --> 18:17.297
And you're what? Other than
an alien, I mean... You know.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.565
Alone.

18:22.369 --> 18:25.205
Anyway, what was the favor
you wanted to ask me?

18:25.238 --> 18:26.373
Oh, um...

18:26.406 --> 18:28.675
The last adventure
that we had together,

18:28.708 --> 18:31.611
I learned about a very cool,
new, non-superpower

18:31.644 --> 18:33.580
-ability that you have.
-Yes.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.115
I was wondering
if you might mind
breaking it out?

18:42.589 --> 18:44.224
You're late, as usual.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.592
Sorry. Had to change.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.295
-Don't you have a time machine?
-Yes. Very droll.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.631
Jefferson, I need to talk
to you. Would you excuse us
for a minute?

18:55.502 --> 18:57.204
Where have you been, man?

18:57.237 --> 18:58.271
Cooking.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.407
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
this event's catered.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.774
Not food.

19:02.709 --> 19:03.843
This.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.512
Wait, I thought that the cure

19:05.545 --> 19:08.348
STAR Labs made for us
was a blue one, not...

19:08.381 --> 19:09.616
It is. This isn't the cure.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.585
This is a molecular
resequencing smart virus

19:12.619 --> 19:15.222
with a non-normative
reciprocal action.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.624
Do you just make up
scientific words to make
yourself sound smarter?

19:17.657 --> 19:20.593
The contents of this file
will rewrite your DNA

19:20.627 --> 19:22.362
and give you superpowers.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.496
Are you serious?

19:23.530 --> 19:24.597
What kind of powers?

19:24.631 --> 19:27.267
Well, I extrapolated it
from the genetic abilities

19:27.300 --> 19:28.901
of a Microhexura Montivaga.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.170
The spruce-fir moss spider.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.441
You're trying
to turn me into Spider-Man?

19:34.474 --> 19:37.744
Well, no. I mean,
you won't be super strong

19:37.777 --> 19:40.247
and able to lift ten times
your body weight.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.348
Nor will you be able to
shoot webs

19:41.381 --> 19:43.516
from a subdermal gland
in your wrist flexor muscle.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.385
But I'll have spidey-sense?

19:45.418 --> 19:46.486
No, I'm afraid not.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.787
So what powers will I have?

19:47.820 --> 19:50.523
You'll be able to
stick to things.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.592
Incredible adhesion.
Like glue.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.895
You'll just be stuck
right on something,
no sliding off.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.196
Mmm.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.666
The spectacular Sticky Man.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.236
Well, I'm sure Cisco
could fashion you a more
exciting sobriquet.

20:03.270 --> 20:06.673
The important thing is,
you can still have
what you want.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.309
You told me,
when we began
our latest adventures,

20:09.342 --> 20:13.346
that all you wanted
was superpowers and be able to
be on the Waverider.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.415
-Yeah, but...
-Now you can have both.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.550
You may not be able
to be Firestorm anymore,

20:17.584 --> 20:20.219
but you can still be a Legend.

20:20.953 --> 20:21.788
[scoffs]

20:21.821 --> 20:23.990
I thought that would
make you happy.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.892
Yeah, you would think that.

20:25.925 --> 20:26.993
[clinking]

20:28.928 --> 20:31.631
Can I have everybody's
attention for a second?

20:32.465 --> 20:33.733
Grab a drink.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.636
All right.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.372
So, the old man
has a few words to say.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.908
What can I possibly say

20:41.941 --> 20:47.013
about Barry and Iris that
everyone in this room doesn't
already know?

20:48.381 --> 20:49.916
How they're special,

20:50.950 --> 20:52.552
and kind,

20:53.052 --> 20:54.287
and brave.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.023
But we all know that, so,

20:57.056 --> 20:59.859
I'm gonna talk to you all
about somebody you might
not know.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.260
Me.

21:03.396 --> 21:08.668
For the longest time,
I have been happy

21:08.701 --> 21:11.070
just to be Dad to these two.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.805
And then Wally comes along

21:13.540 --> 21:14.674
and...

21:16.643 --> 21:18.678
Then watching them

21:19.746 --> 21:22.715
face what they have
in the last few years

21:22.749 --> 21:25.752
with grace, and trust,

21:27.019 --> 21:29.522
and love, so much love...

21:29.556 --> 21:33.693
You see two people
who love like that

21:33.726 --> 21:35.061
and you want it, too.

21:37.430 --> 21:40.299
-Oh, I'm in this speech.
-Yes, you are.

21:42.435 --> 21:43.636
So,

21:44.437 --> 21:46.706
Barry, Iris,

21:48.841 --> 21:50.410
thank you

21:50.443 --> 21:51.844
for showing me
how to love again.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.547
For showing me

21:54.581 --> 21:58.618
that love is the most
important thing we have.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.654
[Joe sniffles]

22:01.688 --> 22:02.989
I love you guys.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.094
-To Barry and Iris.
-[all] To Barry and Iris.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.110
It's no surprise,
but that was a lovely speech.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.145
It was the perfect speech,
straight from the heart.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.380
Yeah.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.083
We should consider
doing something along
these lines.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.786
Along what lines?
What do you mean?

22:33.820 --> 22:36.956
I mean, the friends and family,

22:36.989 --> 22:40.026
and crab cakes, and toasts,
and those lines.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.595
Oh, yeah?
You wanna have
a rehearsal dinner?

22:42.629 --> 22:44.897
What exactly would
we be rehearsing?

22:44.931 --> 22:47.900
The thing that
we would do the next day.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.873
Did I have some
of Cisco's 10,000-proof
cocktail

22:53.906 --> 22:55.608
that he gives to Barry
so that he can get drunk,

22:55.642 --> 22:56.743
or are you asking me
to marry you?

22:56.776 --> 22:58.645
-What if I was?
-What?

22:58.678 --> 23:00.980
That was silly. I am.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.983
I mean, I don't wanna
get down on one knee and
make it overly formal,

23:04.016 --> 23:07.053
because I'm a little bit sore
from handling those ninjas,
but...

23:07.754 --> 23:11.023
Felicity Megan Smoak,

23:12.659 --> 23:13.926
will you marry me?

23:15.027 --> 23:16.028
No.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.164
-No?
-Yes.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.932
-Yes?
-No. No, no.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.835
No. Yes, as in I meant no, no.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.837
No.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.839
I'm not understanding
what's going on here.

23:26.873 --> 23:29.208
I love our life,
I love what we have,

23:29.241 --> 23:30.877
I love William, I...

23:31.811 --> 23:33.045
Are you framing this
for a "but"?

23:33.079 --> 23:34.747
Let's just talk
about this another time.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.048
This might come
as some surprise,

23:36.082 --> 23:37.684
but I'm actually
physically incapable

23:37.717 --> 23:38.785
of talking about
anything else right now.

23:38.818 --> 23:39.986
We don't need a piece of paper

23:40.019 --> 23:41.821
to show each other
that we love each other.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.022
I totally agree with that.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.992
This has nothing to do
with any types of
pieces of paper.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.894
This has to do with
you and me taking
the opportunity

23:47.927 --> 23:49.696
to get up in front of
the people that we love,

23:49.729 --> 23:51.564
to have the people
who love us present,

23:51.598 --> 23:53.165
and make a commitment
to one another.

23:53.199 --> 23:56.035
Yeah, and the commitment part
is great. I'm so down for
the commitment part.

23:56.068 --> 23:58.938
-Mmm-hmm.
-Super on it with that,
but not the legal part.

23:59.739 --> 24:00.973
I'm still not understanding.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.609
-Just forget about it.
-No, Felicity...

24:02.642 --> 24:04.010
Oliver, I don't wanna
marry you.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.481
[chuckles sheepishly]

24:20.793 --> 24:22.895
[soft music playing]

24:25.998 --> 24:31.571
* A face in the crowd
Is watching me *

24:31.604 --> 24:32.972
[wind whooshing]

24:33.005 --> 24:38.745
* Don't you forget that
Love cannot be *

24:38.778 --> 24:41.480
* Taken for granted

24:42.014 --> 24:44.083
Man, I wish I could sleep-fly.

24:46.986 --> 24:53.025
* But I never seem to work out
How it ends *

24:53.059 --> 24:59.165
* And I think it's almost
Never making sense *

24:59.198 --> 25:02.935
* And it's hard to control *

25:02.969 --> 25:07.940
* 'Cause love is emotional *

25:09.809 --> 25:16.749
* Inside the walls
Of monasteries *

25:16.783 --> 25:20.052
* Men make their rounds

25:20.086 --> 25:23.690
* And knowledge
Is their friend *

25:23.723 --> 25:26.626
* Written down

25:26.659 --> 25:27.760
[thuds]

25:27.794 --> 25:31.330
* Reminding us that love
Is a concept *

25:31.363 --> 25:33.900
* A road to redemption

25:33.933 --> 25:37.003
* That's alright *

25:37.036 --> 25:43.042
* But I never seem to work out
What they meant *

25:43.075 --> 25:47.313
* And I think it's almost
Never making sense *

25:47.346 --> 25:50.016
[Mick] Ah. Professor.

25:50.049 --> 25:53.352
Your daughter insisted
I not walk around your
house naked,

25:53.385 --> 25:56.122
so I found one of your dresses.

25:56.856 --> 25:57.757
[clicks tongue]

25:57.790 --> 25:59.158
You're out of milk.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.995
* I feel like a lone star

26:03.029 --> 26:06.098
* Out there
On the edge of the universe *

26:06.132 --> 26:09.201
* Kids sleeping
With their headphones *

26:09.235 --> 26:12.238
* All crying in the car
On the way home *

26:12.271 --> 26:15.007
* Mom's crying
In the front seat *

26:15.041 --> 26:18.344
* Now they're playing
Our song on the radio *

26:43.903 --> 26:46.372
Well, look what the
cat dragged in.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.107
Why is it so bright here?

26:48.140 --> 26:49.909
I mean, don't they have
clouds on this Earth?

26:49.942 --> 26:51.043
-Where have you been?
-Jeez.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.012
Why didn't you come back
to Joe's?

26:53.045 --> 26:54.914
-I was out.
-"Out?"

26:54.947 --> 26:56.683
Out doing what?

26:56.716 --> 26:59.852
Jogging. Fully clothed.

26:59.886 --> 27:02.154
-Why?
-Well, you had me so worried.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.690
You can't just disappear
on another Earth.

27:03.723 --> 27:07.660
Look, I didn't do anything that
I wouldn't have done
on our Earth.

27:07.694 --> 27:09.095
-Okay.
-Per se.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.229
Hey.

27:11.964 --> 27:15.001
Hey, Kara. [stutters] Alex.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.970
Yeah, that's...

27:19.872 --> 27:21.207
-Sara.
-Sara. Okay.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.242
-That's me, I'm Sara.
-[laughs] I knew that.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.377
That's so funny. How are you?

27:25.411 --> 27:27.814
How are you?
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

27:27.847 --> 27:29.148
It's such a perfect day
for a wedding.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.349
-How are you doing?
-I'm good.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.084
A little hungover,
but I'll survive.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.652
How are you? How's your butt?

27:34.987 --> 27:36.823
I heard you fall
out of bed this morning

27:36.856 --> 27:38.290
and it sounded like it hurt.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.927
Yeah, a little.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.394
[stammers]

27:42.929 --> 27:43.796
[laughs]

27:43.830 --> 27:46.265
All right,
I will catch you guys inside.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.939
-You...
-It was not what it
sounded like.

27:52.972 --> 27:55.942
-...didn't.
-I did. I did.

27:55.975 --> 27:58.878
Like, twice, I think.
Three times.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.947
-My God, what did I do?
-[laughing]

28:00.980 --> 28:03.382
What did I do?
Do you know what I did?

28:03.415 --> 28:06.986
-Uh, not the specifics, no.
-Look, I had a one-night stand.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.855
-You did.
-Kara, it's horrible.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.156
-No.
-I'm terrible.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.860
It's such a guy thing to do.
I am a horrible, terrible guy.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.428
No, you're a healthy,
single lady.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.197
And you just had
a really great time
at a wedding,

28:18.230 --> 28:19.999
there's nothing
wrong with that.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.467
-You didn't do anything wrong.
-I didn't?

28:21.500 --> 28:22.501
No. And Sara's awesome.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.137
Except for the fact
that she's an assassin.

28:26.238 --> 28:28.107
-She's an assassin?
-Mmm-hmm.

28:28.140 --> 28:31.043
-Sassy assassin.
-[laughs]

28:31.077 --> 28:33.412
Get into this church now.

28:33.445 --> 28:36.215
Welcome to the
West/Allen wedding,
can I show you to your seat?

28:36.248 --> 28:37.616
Are you here for the
bride or groom?

28:37.649 --> 28:41.487
Well, considering I've tried
to kill the groom
a couple of times,

28:41.520 --> 28:44.824
it's probably best
I sit on the bride's side.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.292
[woman laughs]

28:46.325 --> 28:48.494
Uh, well, that would be
the left side.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.362
Great.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.100
[indistinct conversation]

28:54.133 --> 28:56.969
[groans and exhales]

28:57.003 --> 28:58.270
Do I know you?

29:00.372 --> 29:01.740
I hate cops.

29:02.341 --> 29:05.177
-Hi, David.
-Hi, Cecile.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.179
And lawyers.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.849
Friend from work?

29:11.583 --> 29:12.785
Not quite.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.889
[waitress] Would you like some
sparkling water?

29:20.226 --> 29:22.228
-Sparkling?
-Excuse me?

29:22.261 --> 29:23.562
[Barry] Oh, um...

29:23.595 --> 29:26.065
I just thought
you might be a little parched.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.034
Big day, jitters and all.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.101
You're getting married.

29:29.135 --> 29:30.236
-I am.
-Today.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.971
Today. Yes, I am. Today. Yeah.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.339
Yeah.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.909
So, sparkling water?
I have lemon, I have lime.

29:36.943 --> 29:39.211
-I'm good. Thank you.
-Okay.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.214
-I'm really excited to be here.
-Oh.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.315
I mean, at a wedding.

29:43.349 --> 29:46.418
Any wedding. It just
so happens to be your wedding.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.388
-You love weddings.
-I really do.

29:49.421 --> 29:50.923
-That's cool.
-Actually.

29:50.957 --> 29:55.261
And, I don't know,
I just feel like this is gonna
be one for the ages.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.530
I'm really happy
I got to see it.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.600
Have we met?

30:01.633 --> 30:05.337
No. No, I'm a complete
and total stranger.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.139
[stutters]
Good luck up there.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.575
Just remember to say "I do."

30:10.442 --> 30:11.911
Right.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.412
-Okay.
-All right.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.888
That's my cue. You sit.
Take that.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.961
[music playing]

30:36.635 --> 30:41.941
* Can't say how the days
Will unfold *

30:41.974 --> 30:46.946
* Can't change what the
Future may hold *

30:46.979 --> 30:49.048
* But I want you in it

30:49.081 --> 30:52.885
* Every hour, every minute

30:52.919 --> 30:57.890
* This world can race by
far too fast *

30:57.924 --> 31:02.929
* Hard to see
While it's all flying past *

31:03.963 --> 31:05.597
* But it's clear now *

31:05.631 --> 31:08.968
* You're standing here now *

31:09.001 --> 31:15.074
* I am meant to be
Wherever you are next to me *

31:15.107 --> 31:19.278
* All I want to do

31:19.311 --> 31:22.081
* Is come running home to you

31:22.114 --> 31:25.284
* Come running home to you

31:25.317 --> 31:30.022
* And all my life
I promise to *

31:30.056 --> 31:32.358
* Keep running home to you

31:32.391 --> 31:36.662
*Keep running home to you

31:36.695 --> 31:38.664
[whispers] I wish your parents
were here to see this.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.033
They are.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.470
Everyone, please be seated.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.007
Welcome to you all.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.076
I'm honored
to be presiding over
the wedding

31:50.109 --> 31:52.411
of Barry Allen and Iris West.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.314
Although I don't know
them well,

31:55.347 --> 31:57.316
I know that this is
a good match.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.685
How do I know that? Well...

31:59.718 --> 32:00.586
[clears throat]

32:00.619 --> 32:02.989
Because of you,
because of all of you.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.423
Looking out at their friends

32:04.456 --> 32:05.958
-and their family...
-[Mick snoring]

32:05.992 --> 32:09.328
...and seeing the joy on
all your faces,

32:09.361 --> 32:11.497
seeing how happy
you are for them,

32:11.530 --> 32:13.365
tells me everything
I need to know.

32:14.700 --> 32:18.704
It tells me that
these two people
deserve to be together.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.107
They deserve to be happy

32:21.740 --> 32:23.175
and fulfilled.

32:23.209 --> 32:25.111
And they deserve
a long life together.

32:26.212 --> 32:28.047
And now to the standard
housekeeping.

32:28.080 --> 32:31.483
Does anyone have just cause
why these two should
not be married?

32:32.518 --> 32:35.387
Speak now,
or forever hold your peace.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.490
[guests gasping and screaming]

32:41.060 --> 32:43.695
[dramatic music playing]

32:46.498 --> 32:48.634
Peace is overrated.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.702
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

32:51.237 --> 32:52.538
Nazis?

32:53.672 --> 32:55.374
-I hate Nazis.
-I hate Nazis.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.179
[gunshots]

33:02.814 --> 33:04.516
[bullets clatter]

33:12.258 --> 33:14.093
Get everybody out of here!

33:14.126 --> 33:15.761
Go, get 'em out, okay?

33:15.794 --> 33:17.296
-Hey.
-I love you.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.131
-I love you.
-Go.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.500
Out! Out. Out, everybody out.

33:25.804 --> 33:27.173
[gunfire continues]

33:30.276 --> 33:33.212
I think it's time
you introduced these guys to
your mean roommate.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.751
[distorted voice]
Where did she get this outfit?

33:42.621 --> 33:44.556
That's what I'm talking about.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.499
[yelling]

33:53.799 --> 33:55.067
[gunfire]

34:03.342 --> 34:05.444
-Who are you?
-Come find out.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.063
[Kara grunts]

34:41.213 --> 34:43.515
One weapon, two humans.

34:57.363 --> 34:58.697
[rattling]

34:59.365 --> 35:00.666
Wanna fight?

35:41.940 --> 35:43.309
[man whimpers]

35:50.849 --> 35:51.883
[groans]

35:53.819 --> 35:55.621
Cisco, up top!
I need a breach!

36:17.008 --> 36:18.677
[metal clanging]

36:22.881 --> 36:24.216
[groans]

36:34.893 --> 36:36.228
[gunfire]

36:46.305 --> 36:47.673
[distorted voice] Stay down.

36:52.578 --> 36:53.945
[grunts]

36:53.979 --> 36:55.314
[glass shattering]

37:11.430 --> 37:12.364
[distorted voice] No!

37:12.398 --> 37:13.399
[groaning]

37:17.769 --> 37:20.272
Fall back.
Everybody fall back.

37:21.673 --> 37:22.841
[explosion]

37:30.682 --> 37:31.950
Best wedding ever.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.865
[Barry] Iris.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.035
I'm so sorry.

37:51.570 --> 37:52.838
I know, babe.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.841
And, I'm fine.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.009
The most important thing
is that we're both okay.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.946
And look, who knew
that Monique Lhuillier

38:00.979 --> 38:02.648
could survive a gunfight.

38:02.681 --> 38:03.915
[chuckles]

38:04.950 --> 38:06.752
I am going to marry you.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.789
I know.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.603
There must be
some way to wake him up.

38:24.636 --> 38:26.572
I honestly think
the world has gone mad.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.975
He's definitely got
a concussion.
It's not too bad, though.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.843
He'll be out
for a little while.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.947
May I ask why
you're dressed like that?

38:35.981 --> 38:37.115
Oh.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.885
I become Killer Frost
whenever I'm angry or scared,

38:39.918 --> 38:41.920
and something tells me
I'm gonna be both of those

38:41.953 --> 38:43.389
before this is all over.

38:44.055 --> 38:45.357
Astonishing.

39:02.140 --> 39:03.809
[Wally]
So, what's the game plan?

39:03.842 --> 39:04.910
There is none yet.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.012
Whoever attacked us
knows who we are,

39:07.045 --> 39:10.782
so I think just get Joe
and Cecile as
far away as possible.

39:10.816 --> 39:13.018
Oh, no way, man.
I have to help out. Come on.

39:13.051 --> 39:15.654
You're helping
by keeping our family safe.

39:15.687 --> 39:16.855
[Joe] He's right.

39:16.888 --> 39:19.625
Until we know what these
people want,
nobody's safe.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.468
[door beeping]

39:34.540 --> 39:36.374
[door shuts]

39:40.011 --> 39:41.947
You wiped the minds
of the guests at the wedding?

39:41.980 --> 39:45.851
Yep. Everyone's
secret identity remains secret.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.152
Any idea where they fled?

39:47.185 --> 39:50.088
No. I flew over the
entire city,
there's no trace of them.

39:50.121 --> 39:52.958
Well, clearly they attacked
because you all were there.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.961
Killers, heroes, then what?

39:55.994 --> 39:59.498
If I know my history,
ethnic cleansing,
world domination.

39:59.531 --> 40:00.866
Make America Aryan again.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.701
Which it never was.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.503
Hashtag "melting pot."

40:04.536 --> 40:05.671
I hate Nazis.

40:05.704 --> 40:08.474
Their appearance seems
quite a severe course of action

40:08.507 --> 40:11.610
in support of a cause
that was defeated over
70 years ago.

40:11.643 --> 40:14.513
Apparently they didn't know
about the Yalta Conference.

40:14.546 --> 40:15.947
What's a Yalta?

40:15.981 --> 40:18.584
That woman
didn't seem surprised
to see me.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.085
How did she even know
you were on this Earth?

40:20.118 --> 40:21.787
And how was she
as strong as you?

40:21.820 --> 40:23.489
That archer matched me,

40:24.490 --> 40:26.492
shot for shot.

40:26.525 --> 40:28.527
You know, I think
it's time we got some answers.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.563
[Jax] Yeah,
he ain't exactly talking.

40:32.864 --> 40:34.199
So let's make him talk.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.146
[footsteps approaching]

40:51.583 --> 40:54.185
[Dark Arrow]
The Kryptonian was stronger
than we anticipated.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.021
[Overgirl] Next time,
she won't be so lucky.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.225
What did you do?

41:03.762 --> 41:05.096
What did you do?

41:06.097 --> 41:08.767
You were supposed to wait
until we were ready

41:08.800 --> 41:10.235
before you attacked!

41:12.571 --> 41:14.640
Opportunity knocked
in the form of a wedding.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.074
We answered.

41:16.107 --> 41:18.944
Opportunity knocked
and you answered.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.046
Well, now,
because of your recklessness,

41:21.079 --> 41:22.213
we have lost Prometheus.

41:22.247 --> 41:26.251
Boys, boys, boys, don't fight.

41:26.284 --> 41:30.589
You need to save your power,
your anger, for those heroes.

41:33.725 --> 41:36.261
We will have another chance
to achieve victory.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.832
And when we do,

41:40.866 --> 41:44.135
we will kill every last
one of them.
