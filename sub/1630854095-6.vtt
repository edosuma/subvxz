trying to keep costs down.

08:34.122 --> 08:36.080
The reason that
I'm courting cake-eaters

is trying to convince them
that war fighter safety

08:38.518 --> 08:40.563

aren't mutually exclusive.

-not just rubbing elbows.
-Oh, well,

08:44.741 --> 08:46.961

since I let Bravo

for something actionable.

Drones aren't
fucking actionable?

Not when the Syrian government

has told the world
that they were ours.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.661

to force Command's hand.

09:34.704 --> 09:37.228
Commander Nouri, she was right.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.404
We just used the YPJ
and abandoned 'em.

for the Crampton attack

09:42.190 --> 09:44.496
said CIWZ didn't fail,
it was jammed,

09:44.540 --> 09:46.411
which is pretty
sophisticated tech

09:46.455 --> 09:48.631
for the al-Sham brigade
to have access to.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.633
Yeah, that's a lot of tech
for a local militia.

09:50.677 --> 09:54.289
I agree, which is why I believe
Yasiri's militants

09:54.332 --> 09:55.986
are a proxy
for someone stronger.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.336
-Probably a state actor.
-A state actor-- who?

09:58.380 --> 09:59.860
I'm trying to figure that out.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.296
Instead of trying, start doing.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.559
Says the guy who twice
had Yasiri in his crosshairs

10:03.603 --> 10:04.778
and came home empty.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.303
-[knocking]
-ERIC: Everyone okay?

10:10.261 --> 10:12.133
What's going on?

10:12.176 --> 10:13.395
Just spinning our wheels here

10:13.438 --> 10:15.223
instead of getting
the job done in Syria.

10:15.266 --> 10:18.356
No one likes tucking tail,
but orders are orders.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.751
JASON [sighs]:
You know what? Clay's getting

10:21.795 --> 10:24.188
more work done at Green Team
than we are here combined.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.668
-Mm.
-DAVIS: What?

10:27.017 --> 10:28.715
Something wrong with Clay?

10:28.758 --> 10:30.630
-There was.
-I'm sorry.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.370
What do you mean, "there was"?

10:32.414 --> 10:34.808
Spenser's superior
suggested he take some time off

10:34.851 --> 10:37.680
-after some erratic behavior.
-"Erratic behavior."

10:37.724 --> 10:39.508
What do you mean,
erratic behavior?

10:39.551 --> 10:41.118
Probably the same stuff you'd do

10:41.162 --> 10:43.381
if you went from being
the Navy's deadliest weapon

10:43.425 --> 10:45.819
to training the Navy's
deadliest weapon, Master Chief.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.211
He'll be fine.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.215
As the two of you
should be, too.

10:51.259 --> 10:54.958
And whatever this argument is,
wrap it up.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.351
Yes, sir.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.356
I had no idea.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.054
I'm here, and I had no idea.

11:04.098 --> 11:05.839
Just take care of Syria,
all right?

11:05.882 --> 11:07.144
I'll worry about Clay.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.420
-[crickets chirping]
-[owl hooting]

11:26.468 --> 11:29.036
[groaning]:
Here we go.

11:29.079 --> 11:32.343
Let's get this party started.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.171
Whoa.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.607
[Sonny coughs]

11:35.651 --> 11:38.045
CLAY: So, this is how
the Unabomber lived.

11:38.088 --> 11:40.003
SONNY:
Oh, yeah.

11:40.047 --> 11:42.614
[whispering]:
Be careful. They're listening.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.530
It's not exactly
a nice thing to say

11:45.574 --> 11:47.402
about the ultimate team guy.

11:47.445 --> 11:49.534
He's got our picture
in his vacation home.

11:51.101 --> 11:54.714
He wanted us with him,
even when he got away.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.585
[chuckles] Wow.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.680
-There we go.
-Metal made these?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.769
Oh, yeah, man.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.641
Never seen his drawings before?
He is quite the artist.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.687
That guy said more to me
on his Medevac flight

12:11.731 --> 12:14.124
than the three years
I operated next to him.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.656
Is this a treasure map?

12:27.790 --> 12:29.487
You think he buried cash
in the woods?

12:29.531 --> 12:32.012
If Metal played John Dillinger
in his downtime,

12:32.055 --> 12:34.014
would you be surprised?

12:34.057 --> 12:35.406
Oh, man.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.104
I forgot. Check this out.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.933
-Oh, yes, we get settled in.
-[bag unzipping]

12:39.976 --> 12:41.543
Then we can watch

12:41.586 --> 12:43.893
the original adventures
of Topper Harley.

12:43.937 --> 12:46.243
I'm, uh, assuming, uh,

12:46.287 --> 12:48.245
you want to have
the bottom bunk, yeah?

12:48.289 --> 12:50.552
[pills rattling]

12:53.337 --> 12:55.209
Mm.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.254
Thought you were fixing
to do rehab clean.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.169
I was.

12:59.213 --> 13:01.128
And then I realized
I lost my fucking leg.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.829
I-I've seen you chug Vikes
after ops.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.657
You're-you're gonna
bust my balls

13:08.700 --> 13:11.138
-for taking one now and then?
-I-I get it, I get it.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.967
Look, the natural stuff
doesn't always cut it

13:14.010 --> 13:16.621
after a long day of Green Team.

13:16.665 --> 13:19.494
Now, do you want to watch me
pee in a cup,

13:19.537 --> 13:21.888
or do you want to watch
Valeria Golino

13:21.931 --> 13:24.325
shoot an olive from her
belly button into her mouth.

13:24.368 --> 13:27.154
Well, technically,
Charlie Sheen triggers the olive

13:27.197 --> 13:29.504
by pressing on her belly.

13:35.292 --> 13:36.859
Ooh.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.253
That's a telltale sign
right there, there's a rat.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.341
Shit.

13:40.384 --> 13:42.169
There are sharks
in the homestead.

13:42.212 --> 13:44.388
[sighs] Well...

13:45.737 --> 13:47.261
...if not a Navy movie...

13:49.393 --> 13:52.788
...how about a Navy board game?

13:52.832 --> 13:56.009
-Even if you do cheat.
-[chuckles]

13:57.140 --> 13:59.099
[bag rustling, zipping]

13:59.142 --> 14:01.666
MANDY:
No need to overthink it.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.625
Based on the itinerary
I've planned,

14:03.668 --> 14:05.888
you can pack lightly.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.542
Oh. [chuckles]

14:07.585 --> 14:10.458
Your mind is not
on our getaway at all.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.025
Huh?

14:12.068 --> 14:13.635
Are you still
thinking about Clay?

14:16.029 --> 14:18.422
Did I ever tell you
about Theo Papadakis?

14:19.510 --> 14:21.773
-Used to be in Bravo?
-Yeah, lost his leg

14:21.817 --> 14:23.384
to a grenade in Afghanistan.

14:23.427 --> 14:24.994
After his injury,
he was out of sight

14:25.038 --> 14:26.953
and out of mind to me,
and I just...

14:26.996 --> 14:28.911
I thought I was over that.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.827
And it looks like I'm just doing
the same thing with Clay.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.916
You were front-sight focused
on deployment.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.136
Yeah, I spent more time
looking over my shoulder at Omar

14:36.179 --> 14:38.965
instead of checking in on Clay.

14:39.008 --> 14:42.011
He deserves better from the guy
that put him inside the wire.

14:42.055 --> 14:44.013
Really? You're back here?

14:44.057 --> 14:46.407
-Even Clay doesn't blame you.
-Well, he doesn't have to.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.497
He doesn't have to, all right?

14:49.540 --> 14:51.803
You know, I'm...
I'm the one who ignored

14:51.847 --> 14:55.024
the warning signs of my head.

14:55.068 --> 14:58.723
I put him right on the path
to get hit by those RPGs.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.247
So, you only stopped
beating yourself up

15:00.290 --> 15:01.509
because you thought he was okay?

15:03.206 --> 15:04.947
-Yeah.
-Clay's struggling

15:04.991 --> 15:06.383
is hard on everyone.

15:07.994 --> 15:11.084
If you need to check on him,
I understand.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.347
How am I gonna do that?
We're packing up right now.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.349
-We're on our way out.
-We are.

15:15.392 --> 15:19.831
But it sounds like Clay
needs his team leader.

15:19.875 --> 15:23.748
And I'm pretty sure
that a very wise

15:23.792 --> 15:26.490
and very handsome man
once told me

15:26.534 --> 15:27.970
there's no choice in duty.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.104
Yeah.

15:34.324 --> 15:37.501
A lot easier if we just use
flintlock and gunpowder.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.113
It's not sportsmanlike,

15:40.156 --> 15:43.943
but we're opting
for stealth over power.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.728
I'm not sure how stealthy
we're gonna be,

15:46.771 --> 15:48.512
the way you run your mouth.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.732
The deer are gonna hear us
from a mile away.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.821
Hey, man, I may have
the right to remain silent.

15:52.864 --> 15:53.909
I just don't have
the ability to.

15:53.953 --> 15:54.954
Mm-hmm.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.349
You know,
we could just hang here

15:59.393 --> 16:01.003
and pound some beers
and act out Hot Shots!

16:04.224 --> 16:06.574
You serious? Come on, man,

16:06.617 --> 16:09.446
we've been planning
this bow-hunting trip forever,

16:09.490 --> 16:11.057
Ernest Heming-Clay.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.798
And it ain't like you
to hide in the shadows

16:13.842 --> 16:15.235
of your mother's apron.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.290
You gonna tell me the timing

16:27.334 --> 16:28.900
of this "can't do nothing"
attitude

16:28.944 --> 16:33.470
and popping pills
is just all a coincidence?

16:33.514 --> 16:36.473
Told you, man, Green Team's
been kicking my ass lately.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.260
You think I'm proud of that?

16:41.391 --> 16:43.567
Or needing pills
to numb the pain?

16:43.611 --> 16:46.222
What else you think
it's numbing?

16:46.266 --> 16:48.659
Falling out of contact with me
while I was overseas,

16:48.703 --> 16:50.270
not spending time
with your family.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.968
Clay, these are all problems
that are just gonna snowball.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.491
[sighs]

16:58.321 --> 17:01.107
When I was kicking doors,
I liked feeling dangerous.

17:02.195 --> 17:05.154
Now Stella looks at me
like I amdangerous.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.156
Thinking I'm a threat to Brian
hurts worse than anything

17:07.200 --> 17:08.723
that's come along
with this injury,

17:08.766 --> 17:10.594
and that's why I removed
myself from the situation.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.945
Wow. Look at that right there.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.819
Herc-Clay-les finally feels
what it's like to be human,

17:17.862 --> 17:19.125
just like the rest of us.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.565
Let me give you a piece
of advice from a guy

17:24.608 --> 17:26.915
that's been pissing
in the wind his entire life.

17:28.047 --> 17:32.181
You need to get comfortable
with being uncomfortable.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.097
And I'll tell you what.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.839
For all that you
and your wife have been through,

17:37.882 --> 17:39.667
you sure as shit owe it to her

17:39.710 --> 17:42.757
to prove that you are still
the stand-up guy that she loves.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.498
[laughing]:
I'm sorry.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.630
There it is right there, look,
you're smiling again, man.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.284
See, look at them pearly whites.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.766
Let's go hunting, man. Come on.

17:51.809 --> 17:54.073
Let's do this.
Let's kill some shit.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.729
I've had my fill
of sucking at things of late.

18:00.905 --> 18:03.343
But if you're up
for an adventure,

18:03.386 --> 18:05.432
we could go see where
Metal's treasure map leads.

18:05.475 --> 18:06.868
Yeah?

18:06.911 --> 18:09.000
Well, it's time
to fucking shine.

18:09.044 --> 18:11.090
Let's go.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.874
Yep.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.267
Is that so you can zoom in
on the stuff

18:14.310 --> 18:15.485
that your old eyes can't see?

18:15.529 --> 18:16.921
Shut your face, Pegleg.

18:16.965 --> 18:19.141
Just in case we have
an emergency out there,

18:19.185 --> 18:21.491
we got this map here
for toilet paper.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.145
[laughs]

18:23.189 --> 18:25.365
-Here's Jason! Ha-ha!
-Whoa!

18:26.844 --> 18:28.803
Boy Scouts earn
your archery badge yet?

18:30.196 --> 18:32.154
SONNY:
Are you kidding me?

18:32.198 --> 18:34.635
What is with the, uh,
coordinated ambush here?

18:34.678 --> 18:36.550
Well, you know, Davis told us
you were here, right?

18:36.593 --> 18:37.594
Davis?

18:37.638 --> 18:39.596
Yeah, and, uh,
Ray wanted to come,

18:39.640 --> 18:42.947
but a, uh, vet center opening
has him in a time crunch, so...

18:42.991 --> 18:45.167
No reason this can't be
the bachelor party

18:45.211 --> 18:46.995
that Bravo 6 never had.

18:47.038 --> 18:49.780
Unless you got a sasquatch
planning to strip for us,

18:49.824 --> 18:51.608
there's not a lot
of group activities up here.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.958
-Ugh.
-Ooh, what's, uh...

18:54.002 --> 18:55.395
what do you got there?

18:55.438 --> 18:57.048
Metal was a man of mystery.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.876
-JASON: Buried treasure, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.183
Wouldn't put it past Metal
to pull off the Lufthansa heist.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.142
Or it could be Saddam's gold.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.274
Or the missing money
from the Captain Phillips raid.

19:05.318 --> 19:07.146
SONNY: Brock, how many times
do I gotta tell you,

19:07.189 --> 19:11.106
what happens on the Indian Ocean
stays on the Indian Ocean.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.064
Well, it's ours now.

19:13.108 --> 19:16.764
So, you know what?
I say we go hunting.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.769
♪

19:35.261 --> 19:39.743
Jesus, Brock, you almost
walked us into some poison ivy.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.267
Threat of a rash
make you consider

19:41.310 --> 19:43.225
finding some shirts
with sleeves?

19:43.269 --> 19:46.359
Clay, I live by a code--
"sun's out, guns out."

19:46.402 --> 19:49.579
Hold up, man, this symbol
means we need to gain elevation.

19:50.754 --> 19:51.799
Oh.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.193
Up that way.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.498
Six, take us out, will you?

19:55.542 --> 19:56.630
Come on.

20:05.900 --> 20:10.121
The, uh, robot foot's
not built for this terrain.

20:10.165 --> 20:12.211
It's the end of the road
for me, boys.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.388
You know what, look,
we'll find a secondary infil.

20:15.431 --> 20:16.867
There's gotta be a switchback
around here somewhere.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.217
Sonny, Trent, recon, will you?

20:19.653 --> 20:21.916
You guys just go ahead,
climb up without me, all right?

20:21.959 --> 20:24.266
Dude, I could
fireman-carry you up there.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.746
No, hey, don't fucking touch me.

20:31.491 --> 20:34.320
Look, y-you guys just... just
go on ahead without me, man.

20:34.363 --> 20:36.060
You don't need me
slowing you guys down.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.586
You know what, this whole
tree-hugging hiking thing's

20:39.629 --> 20:40.935
a bunch of bullshit.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.291
If you don't know
what the problem is,

30:15.335 --> 30:16.423
you cannot work the problem.

30:16.466 --> 30:17.772
He's taking pills, Sonny.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.340
Yeah, Jace, I know
he's taking pills, okay?

30:20.383 --> 30:22.429
But what you don't know
is that he's left his home

30:22.472 --> 30:23.822
and he's crashing at my place.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.824
You know what?
He's gaslighting all of us.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.173
I was making progress, okay?

30:27.216 --> 30:28.870
It fucked up his head even more,

30:28.914 --> 30:31.133
the fact that we made him fail
in front of his teammates.

30:31.177 --> 30:33.744
-I did...
-Guys, he's right there.

30:33.788 --> 30:35.181
All right, look, I feel bad

30:35.224 --> 30:36.530
that I wasn't there
when he got hurt.

30:36.573 --> 30:38.097
You guys were down
a medic in the field.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.185
Ah, fuck.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.841
[sighs] It's just--

30:42.884 --> 30:45.669
it's just hard not to...
[sighs]

30:45.713 --> 30:47.497
It's hard not to feel
like we failed him.

30:48.585 --> 30:50.674
Just seeing him
down like this...

30:50.718 --> 30:52.894
Guess we shouldn't be surprised.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.417
It's not just...

30:54.461 --> 30:56.202
He's lost more than a leg.

30:57.246 --> 31:00.075
Yeah. The brotherhood.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.903
His sense of purpose.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.906
I know I lost that
when I walked away.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.908
[sighs]

31:06.952 --> 31:09.258
You know, I'm happy he survived.
We all are.

31:09.302 --> 31:10.781
But, I mean,
seeing him like this...

31:10.825 --> 31:13.915
I get why some operators
feel warriors

31:13.959 --> 31:15.438
are meant to die
on the battlefield.

31:15.482 --> 31:17.484
[vehicle approaching]

31:17.527 --> 31:20.182
Oh, we got some action.
No way.

31:20.226 --> 31:22.358
You think these ass-clowns
followed us home from the bar?

31:22.402 --> 31:24.795
It's a long way to drive
for another beatdown.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.188
Whoa.

31:26.232 --> 31:27.929
SONNY:
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

31:30.279 --> 31:32.891
-Round ten!
-Hah!

31:33.761 --> 31:35.632
Whoa.

31:35.676 --> 31:37.939
[chuckles] I didn't realize
I was stepping into the Octagon.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.245
[door closes]

31:39.288 --> 31:41.247
-You made it.
-Yeah.

31:41.290 --> 31:42.639
Me and Naima made good progress,

31:42.683 --> 31:44.554
but this isn't the fun
I was expecting.

31:44.598 --> 31:45.947
The hell's going on?

31:45.991 --> 31:48.254
Ah, it's a fucking long story,
Ray, long story.

31:48.297 --> 31:52.258
There's a rat.
And it ate all our food.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.786
[knocking at door]

31:58.829 --> 32:01.223
-[door opens]
-RAY: Yo.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.400
Jameelah made you cookies.

32:04.444 --> 32:07.012
Don't open 'em, man.
This place has rats.

32:07.055 --> 32:08.709
Passing on
double-chocolate chunk.

32:08.752 --> 32:10.102
It's as bad as the guys said.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.581
I don't need
your pep talk, Ray.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.975
I'm not your kid.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.064
No, you're not.

32:17.283 --> 32:18.501
You're my brother.

32:20.155 --> 32:24.290
And I am sorry that
I haven't been in touch more.

32:24.333 --> 32:26.031
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.381
You've been through worse,
a lot worse, and you're fine.

32:28.424 --> 32:30.687
[scoffs]

32:30.731 --> 32:33.821
I did not get anywhere close
to being fine...

32:35.605 --> 32:37.085
...until I admitted
that I wasn't.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.742
And being with
my brothers helps.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.439
Lightens the load.

32:43.483 --> 32:45.093
You're on your own.

32:45.137 --> 32:47.269
I can handle my shit.

32:47.313 --> 32:50.055
[chuckles] Well,
your ego's healthy, anyway.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.363
But I'm here to tell you
you cannot.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.630
You know, when I was instructing
the Green Team,

33:00.674 --> 33:02.328
Jace sent me there
as punishment.

33:03.938 --> 33:06.593
And it is hard
telling kids how to do stuff

33:06.636 --> 33:08.508
when you'd rather
be doing the stuff.

33:08.551 --> 33:10.249
Green Team was my choice.

33:10.292 --> 33:13.774
The circumstances
around that choice have changed.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.951
You can reevaluate.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.998
If it's not scratching
the itch to serve,

33:20.041 --> 33:22.304
you know, there...
there are other ways.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.132
Is that what your vet center
is for you?

33:25.438 --> 33:26.874
It's another way to serve?

33:26.917 --> 33:28.528
Guys lucky enough
to come home

33:28.571 --> 33:30.965
aren't lucky if they end up
like Brett, Swann, or Sam.

33:33.098 --> 33:35.361
Just trying to fill a need.

33:36.579 --> 33:39.278
You think I'm headed
where they ended up?

33:40.670 --> 33:43.151
Boys make it sound like
you're nearing a slippery slope.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.894
What do you think?

33:51.029 --> 33:53.422
I used to look at the future

33:53.466 --> 33:55.511
and all I saw was possibilities.

34:00.299 --> 34:02.518
And now I'm scared of what's
around the next corner.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.568
[sighs]

34:08.611 --> 34:12.746
Do you know why I pushed Jace
so hard to draft you to Bravo?

34:12.789 --> 34:14.704
'Cause my raw talent
made me a ninja operator?

34:14.748 --> 34:16.402
RAY:
[chuckles] Shit.

34:17.490 --> 34:19.840
Brilliant tactical skills aside,

34:19.883 --> 34:21.929
you were the guy who saw
what needed to be done,

34:21.972 --> 34:23.061
and you did it.

34:24.671 --> 34:28.240
The leg does not change that.
Hmm?

34:29.806 --> 34:31.330
Fighting for Swanny,
taking the heat for me

34:31.373 --> 34:32.679
on the Marsden letter,
stepping up

34:32.722 --> 34:35.334
to protect Jason
and-and Bravo over his TBI?

34:35.377 --> 34:37.684
I mean, even as the low man,

34:37.727 --> 34:39.729
you always found a way
to make an impact.

34:39.773 --> 34:42.689
It was not the rifle
that made you shine, man.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.908
You are still that guy, Clay.

34:44.952 --> 34:47.824
You just--
you gotta find a new way

34:47.868 --> 34:49.870
to use all of that
God-given raw talent.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.491
[Ray exhales]

35:02.535 --> 35:05.103
Our boy's down right now,
but we can pick him up.

35:06.452 --> 35:09.455
Reminded him that, uh,
none of us carry this alone.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.980
Just like you told me.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.895
Hmm.

35:14.938 --> 35:18.028
You got any idea
how Davis found out

35:18.072 --> 35:20.553
that I lost Yasiri
in my crosshairs?

35:22.032 --> 35:24.122
You ever hear
of something called AAR?

35:26.602 --> 35:28.822
-I had to fill it out as OIC.
-Mm.

35:28.865 --> 35:30.258
I documented everything
in a way

35:30.302 --> 35:32.042
that wouldn't bring
any blowback to you.

35:35.176 --> 35:36.917
-Hmm.
-Oh.

35:37.918 --> 35:39.267
I see.

35:41.182 --> 35:43.402
Your paranoia had you thinking
it was Omar, huh?

35:46.753 --> 35:48.320
You been handling your business

35:48.363 --> 35:50.191
after those TBI symptoms
flared up?

35:50.235 --> 35:51.801
Yeah, I'm good.
I had another round

35:51.845 --> 35:53.716
of stem cells last week.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.502
Take care of the problems
that need to be worked on.

35:56.545 --> 35:58.982
And Omar's not one of them,
that's for sure.

35:59.026 --> 36:00.549
Jace, you gotta learn
to trust Omar,

36:00.593 --> 36:01.898
for your sake and for Bravo's.

36:01.942 --> 36:05.032
Why?
Why do I gotta do that?

36:08.253 --> 36:09.993
Because I'm retiring
after I hit my 20.

36:14.084 --> 36:17.000
[clears throat] Well, that's
four months from now.

36:17.044 --> 36:19.394
I don't want it
to overshadow this trip.

36:20.961 --> 36:22.702
But I wanted you to know
sooner than later.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.182
What, you just decide this?

36:24.225 --> 36:26.184
Naima and I paused
the conversation

36:26.227 --> 36:27.359
a couple times,
but finally finished it.

36:27.402 --> 36:29.491
Going all in
on the vet center, huh?

36:29.535 --> 36:31.145
Could be a chance to have
more of an impact

36:31.189 --> 36:32.538
than I've been having
with my rifle,

36:32.581 --> 36:34.192
if Syria's any indication.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.150
Syria's not on you.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.804
I know, but...

36:37.847 --> 36:39.109
JASON:
Whoa.

36:39.153 --> 36:40.459
-Hey.
-Yeah.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.461
I also know
that you weren't a big fan

36:42.504 --> 36:43.940
when I became warrant officer.

36:43.984 --> 36:47.074
-Mm-hmm.
-Omar's the real deal, Jay.

36:47.117 --> 36:49.250
And I'm not-- I'm not saying
he totally makes up

36:49.294 --> 36:52.819
for me and Clay,
but you will be supported...

36:53.863 --> 36:55.909
...assuming you ever decide
to read him in on your head.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.258
Mm-hmm.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.436
Say something, brother.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.917
Ray, what the hell
did you say to Clay?

37:03.960 --> 37:06.702
-He took off.
-What do you mean, he took off?

37:06.746 --> 37:09.183
I mean, he's gone,
along with a loaded rifle.

37:18.671 --> 37:20.107
Okay, look,
when was the last time

37:20.150 --> 37:22.414
-you had eyes on him?
-About a half hour ago.

37:22.457 --> 37:24.894
All the cars are still here,
so he's gotta be on foot.

37:24.938 --> 37:26.635
SONNY:
His leg's really bothering him,

37:26.679 --> 37:29.421
so I'm guessing he couldn't
get more than a mile.

37:29.464 --> 37:30.987
No, you know what, he's drunk,

37:31.031 --> 37:32.772
he's hopped up on pills.

37:32.815 --> 37:34.904
He's not thinking clear.

37:34.948 --> 37:36.515
I know when I was away
from Bravo,

37:36.558 --> 37:37.820
I took a few walks in the woods

37:37.864 --> 37:39.387
I didn't intend
to come back from.

37:46.307 --> 37:48.178
All right, Brock,
we gotta split the train.

37:48.222 --> 37:50.311
I want you to drive the route
back to the bar,

37:50.355 --> 37:52.182
see if he's there
causing any more trouble.

37:52.226 --> 37:54.924
Ray, Sonny, and I will split up
and cover the woods on foot.

37:54.968 --> 37:56.361
You stay here,
just in case he comes back.

37:56.404 --> 37:57.536
All right, let's move.

37:57.579 --> 37:58.841
SONNY:
You got it.

37:58.885 --> 38:01.540
Hey, Jace, look.
I was, uh, out of line

38:01.583 --> 38:04.369
by saying, uh...
you made it worse for Clay.

38:04.412 --> 38:06.588
Look, man, we're all on tilt
after seeing him like this.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.938
I know, but the truth is,
I probably was the one

38:08.982 --> 38:10.331
that made it worse
by bringing him up here.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.637
We could have stayed
at my apartment,

38:11.680 --> 38:12.986
played video games,
and there's less a chance

38:13.029 --> 38:14.422
of him getting triggered
on a hike

38:14.466 --> 38:15.989
that he couldn't complete.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.296
What's important right now
is we find our brother, right?

38:18.339 --> 38:20.341
-Roger that.
-Let's go.

38:20.385 --> 38:22.125
[sighs]

38:23.692 --> 38:25.694
♪

38:52.286 --> 38:53.809
Wanna play stump?

38:55.681 --> 38:56.899
I win.

38:58.466 --> 38:59.728
Yeah. I, uh,
probably should have

38:59.772 --> 39:01.861
thought that one through, huh?

39:06.735 --> 39:08.476
Team guys and competition.

39:10.304 --> 39:12.567
-It's like leopards and spots.
-[chuckles]

39:14.482 --> 39:16.049
How'd you find me?

39:16.092 --> 39:19.226
Oh, you know, I just thought
about what I would do, right?

39:22.098 --> 39:24.971
Just fucking adapt
and overcome.

39:25.014 --> 39:27.060
Or die trying.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.630
Ray thinks I became a SEAL
to serve.

39:33.936 --> 39:36.983
I did it to prove
that I'm better than my dad.

39:37.026 --> 39:38.376
That I'm the best.

39:40.552 --> 39:42.815
That's why I was chasing
your footsteps all those years.

39:42.858 --> 39:44.251
Yeah, well, you know what,
you're definitely in

39:44.294 --> 39:46.775
the Frogman Hall of Fame
for me, that's for sure.

39:46.819 --> 39:50.431
-I get in on a sympathy vote?
-[chuckles]

39:50.475 --> 39:52.607
Well, you're definitely not
a first-ballot hall-of-famer

39:52.651 --> 39:55.436
like me, but you earned it.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.525
You fucking earned it, man.

39:57.569 --> 39:58.918
Look...

40:00.615 --> 40:02.312
But I want you to remember
what you told me

40:02.356 --> 40:05.577
back at the--
at the Bulkhead, right?

40:05.620 --> 40:07.274
There's more to life
than operating.

40:07.317 --> 40:09.494
Says the guy who kept
his teammates in the dark

40:09.537 --> 40:10.799
about his TBI.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.411
You're still hiding it
from Command.

40:13.454 --> 40:15.935
Yep. That's me, I'm that guy.

40:15.978 --> 40:19.025
Puts up walls all around him
just so he can push people away,

40:19.068 --> 40:21.331
the people that care about him.

40:21.375 --> 40:22.855
That's what you're doing
right now.

40:24.465 --> 40:29.339
All those years
you wanted to be like Bravo 1,

40:29.383 --> 40:31.864
it took losing your leg
to get there.

40:35.781 --> 40:38.479
So, what'd this map
lead you to, anyway?

40:40.525 --> 40:42.178
Not any solutions.

40:42.222 --> 40:45.007
It all depends on what kind
of problem you're working.

40:46.922 --> 40:49.534
-Teaching at Green Team...
-Mm-hmm.

40:50.578 --> 40:53.886
-...hanging with my brothers.
-[sighs]

40:55.191 --> 40:56.497
I don't fit in.

40:58.717 --> 41:01.241
I might be a team guy,
but I'm not an operator anymore.

41:01.284 --> 41:02.808
Come on, man.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.418
We know brothers
who have come back
