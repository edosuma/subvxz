"The Tao produced One; One produced Two;
Two produced Three; Three produced All things."

00:32.833 --> 00:34.249
"Tao Te Ching by Laozi"

00:55.041 --> 00:56.165
A dog killed him,

00:56.166 --> 00:57.374
but not this dog!

00:57.375 --> 00:58.707
The real murderer is...

01:01.166 --> 01:02.457
Beat me to it again!

01:12.708 --> 01:14.332
Purpose of your trip to America?

01:15.583 --> 01:17.290
I... I...

01:17.291 --> 01:18.832
Why are you here?

01:22.333 --> 01:24.249
To... attend a wedding...

01:43.666 --> 01:44.832
"Chin Fong"

02:11.208 --> 02:12.874
"Chin Fong"

02:17.166 --> 02:18.582
Surprise!

02:20.250 --> 02:21.124
Old Chin!

02:21.125 --> 02:22.749
Welcome to New York!

02:23.250 --> 02:24.499
I lent the helicopter out,

02:24.500 --> 02:26.290
so this'll have to do.

02:26.708 --> 02:27.790
I'm hot, aren't I?

02:27.791 --> 02:28.415
You are really...

02:28.416 --> 02:29.540
Really hot?

02:29.541 --> 02:30.332
Really disgusting!

02:31.083 --> 02:33.624
College has not made you any smarter!

02:33.625 --> 02:34.582
Music!

02:34.583 --> 02:35.374
Go!

03:01.416 --> 03:02.374
Where is Ah Xiang?

03:02.375 --> 03:03.707
Waiting at the cocktail party.

03:03.708 --> 03:05.540
I'll show you around for a couple of days,

03:05.541 --> 03:07.874
Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty...

03:08.291 --> 03:09.915
I wanna check out Queen's manuscript.

03:09.916 --> 03:11.707
Qui Yin? What?

03:12.458 --> 03:13.332
Ellery Queen...

03:13.791 --> 03:15.332
This Queen guy's everywhere

03:15.333 --> 03:16.874
and now he's in New York too?

03:17.875 --> 03:18.832
Hooking up already?

03:18.916 --> 03:19.832
What are you talking about..

03:19.833 --> 03:20.832
Do you know Crimaster?

03:21.041 --> 03:21.749
What is this?

03:22.375 --> 03:24.332
Crimaster, an app.

03:24.416 --> 03:26.124
It is THE community for
all the detectives in the world.

03:26.291 --> 03:27.665
A lot of people upload real cases

03:27.666 --> 03:28.624
for others to crack,

03:28.625 --> 03:30.249
and in some countries,
the success rate of cases solved

03:30.250 --> 03:31.790
has gone up quite a bit thanks to it.

03:32.208 --> 03:33.249
How come your name's there?

03:33.500 --> 03:34.874
That is the ranking of detectives...

03:34.875 --> 03:36.249
You are ranked No.2?

03:36.291 --> 03:37.165
In He Nan?

03:38.375 --> 03:39.165
In the world.

03:39.166 --> 03:40.415
What about my ranking?

03:40.583 --> 03:41.332
You're not on it.

03:42.916 --> 03:44.290
So? Without me in the PPT...

03:44.291 --> 03:45.165
APP...

03:45.208 --> 03:46.915
Can you call it a ranking?

03:46.916 --> 03:48.290
A world wide ranking?

03:48.291 --> 03:49.082
You can't be in it...

03:49.083 --> 03:50.457
you must correctly answer
99 reasoning questions

03:50.458 --> 03:51.415
in order to join the community.

03:51.416 --> 03:53.124
Are you questioning my IQ?

03:53.333 --> 03:54.499
Question number 1...

03:55.625 --> 03:56.290
Sick!

03:56.458 --> 03:58.415
Whoever plays this kind of game is just sick!

04:07.291 --> 04:08.124
Old Chin,

04:08.458 --> 04:10.040
everyone is waiting for you.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.040
The reception is here?

04:22.333 --> 04:24.040
Yes, let's go...

04:43.208 --> 04:44.540
They... are here for the wedding too?

04:44.541 --> 04:46.540
Of course, they are all friends
and relatives of Ah Xiang.

04:46.541 --> 04:48.290
Tomorrow we are going to celebrate together.

04:51.000 --> 04:51.707
Who's that?

04:52.333 --> 04:53.790
Ah Xiang's cousin.

04:54.708 --> 04:55.582
How about this white guy?

04:55.708 --> 04:57.040
Ah Xiang's ex-boyfriend.

04:57.083 --> 04:57.915
You know

04:57.958 --> 04:58.915
before she met me

04:58.916 --> 05:00.207
she used to be quite adventurous

05:00.583 --> 05:01.374
And he is?

05:01.958 --> 05:03.165
Ah Xiang's cousin...

05:04.541 --> 05:05.332
Japanese?

05:05.583 --> 05:06.790
Half Chinese and half Japanese.

05:07.000 --> 05:07.790
And this one?

05:08.166 --> 05:09.457
Ah Xiang's grandmother.

05:12.125 --> 05:12.999
She lives in San Ya,

05:13.000 --> 05:13.957
she's tanned.

05:13.958 --> 05:15.582
- You...
- Why do you

05:15.583 --> 05:16.540
have so many questions?

05:16.541 --> 05:17.540
First you should get over the jet lag...

05:17.541 --> 05:18.874
Do I have too many questions
or do you have a problem?

05:18.875 --> 05:20.374
- What about me?
- You are getting married tomorrow?

05:20.416 --> 05:21.832
- Yes.
- Where is Ah Xiang?

05:21.875 --> 05:23.040
- She...
- See!

05:23.375 --> 05:24.832
Every time she's mentioned,
your eyes shift to the left,

05:24.875 --> 05:25.957
a classic sign of lying.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.957
There is absolutely no wedding atmosphere

05:28.041 --> 05:29.749
because if there was
people would not be ignoring the "groom".

05:29.833 --> 05:30.874
And most importantly,

05:30.916 --> 05:32.624
you always check the calendar
before doing anything even taking a shower,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.499
so tell me how come
you chose tomorrow to get married?

05:34.500 --> 05:35.499
"Avoid wedding,
burial, and house moving"

05:36.458 --> 05:37.499
you tricked me here for a case, didn't you?

05:37.791 --> 05:38.790
How do you know?

05:40.250 --> 05:41.457
The armed doormen imply that
the owner of this house

05:41.458 --> 05:42.499
is an individual of certain importance.

05:43.208 --> 05:44.457
Ah Xiang's "cousin" is using a portable server

05:44.708 --> 05:46.749
which processes information 10 times
faster than a regular computer.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.999
She's using Linux commands,

05:49.000 --> 05:50.124
which reminds me of

05:50.125 --> 05:52.249
the Hong Kong girl hacker Kiko,
ranked No.5 on Crimaster.

05:52.416 --> 05:53.540
She solves her cases by
hacking into police database

05:53.541 --> 05:55.415
and stealing information from it.

05:55.458 --> 05:57.499
She can remove every penny from your account.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.999
My account is penniless!

06:00.333 --> 06:01.540
M37K combat knife,

06:02.041 --> 06:02.874
B9 belt

06:02.916 --> 06:03.915
and Danner combat boots

06:04.291 --> 06:05.790
are all usual US military equipment.

06:06.041 --> 06:07.082
Ranked No.9 that must be

06:07.083 --> 06:08.207
US veteran detective

06:08.208 --> 06:09.374
Wild Bull Billy,

06:09.375 --> 06:10.165
who promotes the use of extreme violence

06:10.166 --> 06:11.082
to solve crimes.

06:11.750 --> 06:12.499
So?

06:12.500 --> 06:14.790
I can beat up 10 of him with my Mojia Boxing!

06:14.791 --> 06:16.207
I saw...

06:16.291 --> 06:17.582
I saw a man,

06:17.583 --> 06:18.665
a lying man!

06:18.666 --> 06:20.207
Even the Indonesian
Psychic Detective Aaimali Kunana

06:20.208 --> 06:21.624
can tell that you are lying!

06:22.416 --> 06:24.457
Ranked No.7, she relies on divination

06:24.458 --> 06:25.457
rather than reasoning

06:25.458 --> 06:26.749
to solve a puzzle.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.874
Can she beat my Dowsing Rod?

06:29.541 --> 06:30.999
He needs no introduction.
Noda Hiroshi from Japan,

06:31.000 --> 06:32.624
the one who's competing
with me for the No.2 spot.

06:32.708 --> 06:34.540
So... How did you infer that?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.124
No need to infer.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.415
He thinks he's hot

06:37.666 --> 06:39.749
and posts way too many nude selfies.

06:44.250 --> 06:45.332
I cannot beat this one.

06:45.958 --> 06:46.999
What about the PRESERVED EGG?

06:47.125 --> 06:47.915
Who's the PRESERVED EGG?

06:48.250 --> 06:49.749
The No.1.

06:49.916 --> 06:51.249
The No.1, "Q",

06:51.333 --> 06:52.707
is an anonymous user in Canada.

06:52.916 --> 06:54.707
I'm not sure that he or she is in this crowd.

06:54.791 --> 06:56.040
Plus, during the last 3 minutes

06:56.041 --> 06:57.540
they have all checked out the hallway.

06:58.166 --> 06:58.874
1 time,

06:59.125 --> 06:59.790
5 times,

06:59.791 --> 07:00.540
3 times,

07:00.541 --> 07:01.165
2 times.

07:01.166 --> 07:02.874
Everyone is obviously
waiting for a very important person...

07:02.958 --> 07:04.374
The owner of this house
is not hard to look up...

07:04.500 --> 07:05.457
Uncle Seven - Wu Zhiyuan,

07:05.625 --> 07:07.582
the highest ranked leader of all Chinese gangs,

07:07.708 --> 07:09.540
the "Godfather of Chinatown".

07:10.375 --> 07:12.457
His grandson Wu Zhihao
was murdered four days ago.

07:12.583 --> 07:13.707
You are not the one who asked me to be here,

07:13.875 --> 07:14.874
he is, right?

07:17.291 --> 07:19.040
I knew I couldn't fool you...

07:19.041 --> 07:20.332
You know I hate being lied to.

07:22.916 --> 07:23.874
Old Chin,

07:24.833 --> 07:26.374
Ah Xiang is married!

07:26.833 --> 07:28.665
I'm not the groom!

07:30.083 --> 07:31.207
She is married to this guy!

07:31.458 --> 07:32.749
He is not as handsome as me,
not as slim as me,

07:32.750 --> 07:33.790
not as elegant as me.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.457
He's such a playboy and

07:35.458 --> 07:36.665
dresses like a peasant!

07:37.916 --> 07:39.749
Just because he's richer than me!

07:40.666 --> 07:42.457
So I need to have a lot of money

07:42.625 --> 07:44.499
to win Ah Xiang back!

07:45.291 --> 07:46.624
So... what does this have to do with me?

07:47.125 --> 07:48.124
5 million!

07:48.250 --> 07:49.374
Dollars!

07:50.041 --> 07:51.457
If we solved

07:51.625 --> 07:52.415
Uncle Seven's grandson's murder,

07:52.416 --> 07:54.457
if you get 2.5 million, I get 2.5 million.

07:54.791 --> 07:55.582
To hell with your 2.5.

07:55.583 --> 07:56.374
Old Chin!

07:56.458 --> 07:58.540
Are you really going to abandon me?

07:58.541 --> 08:00.374
- I'm your uncle!
- Cousin.

08:00.416 --> 08:01.290
We got the same blood running
through our veins!

08:01.291 --> 08:02.332
I'm gonna go see Queen's manuscript!

08:02.666 --> 08:03.665
Old Chin!

08:04.166 --> 08:04.915
Do you know

08:04.958 --> 08:06.665
how much Ah Xiang means to me?

08:07.041 --> 08:09.540
I would die for her!

08:10.250 --> 08:11.499
I will

08:11.875 --> 08:14.999
never love another woman.

08:36.916 --> 08:37.832
Ah Xiang?

08:42.916 --> 08:44.249
Officer Chen!

08:44.375 --> 08:45.707
Welcome!

08:48.291 --> 08:49.374
Mr. Lu,

08:49.416 --> 08:50.957
did you invite these clowns?

08:51.416 --> 08:52.540
They may look like nobodies,

08:52.833 --> 08:54.457
but you have no idea how hard

08:54.541 --> 08:55.999
it was to get them all to come -

08:56.291 --> 08:58.290
you are looking at a real

08:58.291 --> 09:00.499
"World Detective Contest".

09:02.916 --> 09:03.957
Why is there a kid here?

09:05.250 --> 09:06.207
Officer,

09:06.416 --> 09:08.207
I am the detective,

09:08.500 --> 09:10.582
he is just my butler.

09:23.708 --> 09:24.374
Uncle Seven...

09:25.833 --> 09:27.374
The doctor says

09:28.500 --> 09:29.624
I have one week left

09:30.125 --> 09:31.749
at most.

09:31.791 --> 09:33.040
I want to

09:33.458 --> 09:37.040
find Jason's murderer

09:37.041 --> 09:39.332
before I die.

09:39.833 --> 09:41.457
- Understood.
- Let's start.

09:41.791 --> 09:42.624
OK.

09:42.791 --> 09:43.624
Hurry up!

09:46.125 --> 09:47.832
Ladies and Gentlemen,

09:48.416 --> 09:50.207
I am Guofu Lu,

09:50.541 --> 09:52.499
Uncle Seven's godson

09:52.791 --> 09:53.915
as well as...

09:54.000 --> 09:55.374
Shut up!

10:00.416 --> 10:02.124
Let Officer Chen speak!

10:02.291 --> 10:03.415
OK, OK...

10:04.750 --> 10:05.540
Listen,

10:05.541 --> 10:07.249
this is the first and last time

10:07.250 --> 10:08.749
that I will share this info with you...

10:08.958 --> 10:09.915
Yes, yes.

10:09.916 --> 10:11.249
...for Uncle Seven's sake.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.832
I bet you can't understand a word.

10:13.833 --> 10:14.707
Old Chin!

10:14.958 --> 10:15.874
You're still here?

10:16.666 --> 10:18.957
I know deep down in your heart
you care about me!

10:20.416 --> 10:21.832
I'll only say this once...

10:22.083 --> 10:22.874
Four days ago,

10:22.875 --> 10:23.874
on July 1 st,

10:23.875 --> 10:24.874
Jason Wu's body

10:24.875 --> 10:26.832
was found in a temple in Chinatown.

10:26.833 --> 10:27.665
Time?

10:27.875 --> 10:28.999
10:17am.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.624
He was found by the temple's staff.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.332
Someone cut his chest open

10:32.333 --> 10:33.665
and removed the heart.

10:33.958 --> 10:35.332
The perpetrator made a Y-shaped

10:35.333 --> 10:36.707
incision on the victim's chest.

10:36.750 --> 10:39.290
No fingerprints were found
but two details stand out.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.332
First, "sevoflurane" residue collected from

10:41.333 --> 10:43.165
the deceased's nasal cavity and left hand

10:43.166 --> 10:44.165
prove he was poisoned

10:44.166 --> 10:46.124
before being dragged to the crime scene.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.207
Second, from the wounds' vital reaction,

10:48.208 --> 10:49.749
we know the deceased's heart was removed

10:49.750 --> 10:52.582
while he was unconscious but still alive.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.415
Any questions?

10:57.916 --> 10:59.999
The killer is left handed?

11:00.333 --> 11:01.124
That's right.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.415
We also suspect, from the cut's direction...

11:03.625 --> 11:04.915
No need to suspect.

11:05.250 --> 11:08.790
The truth is the sevoflurane
is found on the victim's left hand

11:08.875 --> 11:10.332
approve of that

11:10.583 --> 11:12.165
What's the time of death?

11:12.666 --> 11:14.540
Sometime between 9 and 10 AM.

11:14.541 --> 11:15.332
OK.

11:15.791 --> 11:18.624
Knowing that the gate of Zao Wang Temple

11:18.625 --> 11:19.915
opens at 10am

11:19.916 --> 11:20.624
So?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.332
So here's what's interesting:

11:23.833 --> 11:27.374
The suspect dragged the victim
to the temple and killed him there.

11:28.041 --> 11:29.624
The autopsy said

11:29.625 --> 11:32.790
the victim was killed between 9-10AM.

11:33.375 --> 11:37.582
However, the temple gate only opens at 10am.

11:37.833 --> 11:39.874
Anyways, what I want to say is

11:39.875 --> 11:42.999
even though the suspect could have been seen

11:43.000 --> 11:45.874
why he chose this place, this time

11:45.875 --> 11:47.540
to "punish" the victim

11:48.000 --> 11:50.290
Do you know why?

11:56.250 --> 11:58.124
What is he talking about?

11:58.166 --> 11:59.874
He's taking away

11:59.875 --> 12:00.874
our "Detective Chinatown" limelight!

12:00.875 --> 12:02.540
Go ahead, say something.

12:02.666 --> 12:03.624
Say something.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.749
Chinatown,

12:06.750 --> 12:08.249
Chinese temple,

12:08.250 --> 12:09.540
Chinese people...

12:10.083 --> 12:13.582
I reckon this has nothing to do with religion,

12:13.708 --> 12:15.874
It's connected to Feng Shui.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.790
Chinese geomancy

12:19.250 --> 12:22.499
Anyone here knows anything about Feng Shui?

12:24.458 --> 12:25.707
Why are you pointing at me?

12:25.875 --> 12:27.040
Don't you want to have the limelight?

12:27.750 --> 12:28.499
It's your turn!

12:28.791 --> 12:29.582
My turn?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.374
My turn?

12:31.750 --> 12:32.707
Two years ago

12:32.708 --> 12:34.165
These two solved a gold robbery

12:34.166 --> 12:35.874
and murder case in Bangkok.

12:36.041 --> 12:38.749
They call themselves Detective Chinatown.

12:38.958 --> 12:41.165
Chin Fong is currently a first year student

12:41.166 --> 12:42.915
at the Chinese Police Academy.

12:43.125 --> 12:45.957
Presently ranked No.2 on Crimaster,

12:45.958 --> 12:48.124
but often surpassed by No.3,

12:48.291 --> 12:49.999
Mr. Noda Hiroshi.

12:52.625 --> 12:53.999
As for Mr. Tang Ren...

12:54.208 --> 12:57.165
Intel shows he's more than likely a fraud.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.582
So obviously this is a partnership made of

13:00.583 --> 13:02.082
an "angel" and a "devil",

13:02.416 --> 13:03.665
a genius

13:04.666 --> 13:05.540
and an idiot.

13:07.958 --> 13:08.999
I think I heard my name,

13:09.000 --> 13:09.957
what is that girl saying about me?

13:10.083 --> 13:10.790
She said you're hot.

13:16.583 --> 13:17.582
Chin Fong says that

13:17.583 --> 13:18.749
he knows Feng Shui

13:19.083 --> 13:20.832
Let's take him to the murder site

13:21.291 --> 13:23.749
and show us what he knows

13:24.333 --> 13:25.415
No need for everyone to go,

13:25.416 --> 13:26.290
I'll just bring these two

13:26.291 --> 13:27.290
and that will be enough.

13:27.458 --> 13:28.665
You know Feng Shui?

13:28.750 --> 13:29.499
Ah?

13:29.708 --> 13:30.499
Just say YES!

13:30.666 --> 13:31.540
Oh... YES!

13:31.625 --> 13:33.249
So, do you wanna join me tomorrow morning?

13:33.250 --> 13:34.915
- YES! YES!
- YES! YES!

13:35.083 --> 13:36.499
Do you think we need to bring the rest?

13:36.500 --> 13:37.540
YES! YES!

13:41.375 --> 13:42.499
Quiet.

13:43.666 --> 13:45.207
Ladies and Gentlemen,

13:45.625 --> 13:48.540
I have arranged rooms for everyone,

13:49.041 --> 13:51.665
So have a good night sleep.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.874
Investigation officially starys tomorrow.

13:56.041 --> 13:58.040
You will have enough time.

13:59.250 --> 14:03.957
Including tonight, you will have one week.

14:18.333 --> 14:19.832
Feng Shui master, what have you found?

14:20.208 --> 14:21.207
Well...

14:21.583 --> 14:23.374
Wait, I'm a detective,
not a Feng Shui master!

14:37.625 --> 14:38.415
Yes,

14:38.666 --> 14:40.457
the murderer came in through here.

14:41.083 --> 14:42.457
And the back...

14:42.458 --> 14:43.790
There is no surveillance video,

14:43.791 --> 14:44.874
we've checked...

14:45.208 --> 14:46.207
You can speak Chinese?

14:46.666 --> 14:48.707
You don't know your opponent at all.

14:48.708 --> 14:49.790
I'm mixed.

14:50.416 --> 14:52.082
I told you he is a "chuaner (mix breed)"!

14:52.083 --> 14:53.790
So... the last person to see the victim was...

14:53.833 --> 14:56.124
Jason left his house
the day before around 11 PM,

14:56.333 --> 14:57.665
and no one saw him afterwards.

14:57.708 --> 14:59.082
But his car actually drove away

14:59.083 --> 15:00.790
the next day at 4:05AM,

15:01.000 --> 15:02.957
and 20 minutes later
was parked somewhere nearby,

15:02.958 --> 15:03.957
where the surveillance camera couldn't see.

15:03.958 --> 15:04.749
All that time?

15:04.791 --> 15:06.082
Did he sleep in the car?

15:06.083 --> 15:07.874
The surveillance camera did not get the driver?

15:08.041 --> 15:08.957
If it did,

15:08.958 --> 15:10.415
would she be here?

15:10.458 --> 15:13.207
If you hack into the public grid again,

15:13.250 --> 15:14.582
I will arrest you.

15:14.583 --> 15:16.165
But Officer Chen, you'd need proof for that.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.249
What's on the tape?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.790
The murderer brought the victim here,

15:19.333 --> 15:20.499
but didn't start immediately.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.207
- Specific location.
- Specific time.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.665
Specific method.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.124
Specific 5 million.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.374
SHUT UP!

15:28.041 --> 15:29.832
If I'm not welcome here,

15:29.833 --> 15:31.665
I'll get my ass outta here.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.749
Please do...

15:34.875 --> 15:36.874
but can you grab your own ass?

15:38.125 --> 15:38.790
Well,

15:39.500 --> 15:40.707
I'm leaving!

15:53.375 --> 15:53.999
Hey,

15:54.333 --> 15:55.374
what are you doing?

15:55.958 --> 15:57.124
To get close to the murderer,

15:57.125 --> 15:58.832
you must put yourself in the victim's position.

15:58.833 --> 15:59.665
Get up,

15:59.708 --> 16:01.290
you are ruining the crime scene...

16:02.083 --> 16:02.790
Get up,

16:02.916 --> 16:03.790
Don't move!

16:18.791 --> 16:19.499
Tang,

16:20.000 --> 16:21.207
do you know what this is?

16:23.833 --> 16:24.707
I'm sure,

16:24.916 --> 16:26.040
that this is a...

16:26.416 --> 16:27.749
...symbol.

16:28.458 --> 16:29.290
Of course it's a symbol,

16:29.375 --> 16:30.540
but of what?

16:30.625 --> 16:31.999
How should I know?

16:32.250 --> 16:33.665
Can't find it online.

16:33.791 --> 16:34.999
Let's stop wasting time.

16:35.000 --> 16:35.957
Officer Chen,

16:36.125 --> 16:38.415
you are NYPD's

16:38.416 --> 16:39.332
criminal profiling specialist.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.540
Would you please share with us

16:41.541 --> 16:43.207
the killer's profile?

16:44.458 --> 16:45.374
Male,

16:45.625 --> 16:46.415
Chinese,

16:46.750 --> 16:48.790
25-40 years old,

16:48.791 --> 16:49.665
single,

16:49.791 --> 16:51.290
has stable income,

16:51.458 --> 16:52.749
with some education

16:53.125 --> 16:54.332
and a decent job.

16:54.583 --> 16:57.124
He doesn't necessarily appear violent,

16:57.500 --> 16:59.499
and may even be a gentle man.

16:59.541 --> 17:02.290
Had a relative suffer
an unnatural death.

17:02.416 --> 17:03.207
Ok,

17:03.375 --> 17:05.165
that's similar to the profile that I have.

17:05.165 --> 17:06.457
Is Officer Chen

17:06.458 --> 17:07.582
aware of

17:07.583 --> 17:09.499
the East River case

17:09.500 --> 17:11.124
that happened a week ago?

17:12.790 --> 17:14.332
On June 28th at 6AM,

17:14.500 --> 17:16.332
a man who was fishing in the area

17:16.333 --> 17:17.915
found the body of a white female.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.749
It had the same Y-shape cut,

17:20.000 --> 17:21.915
except that this victim lost a kidney.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.749
Sell kidneys in exchange for phone?

17:24.040 --> 17:25.207
Exactly

17:25.250 --> 17:27.207
I'm wondering why you haven't

17:27.208 --> 17:29.082
connected these two murders?

17:29.375 --> 17:30.374
Officer Chen?

17:30.708 --> 17:33.374
First of all, the districts are different.

17:33.583 --> 17:34.540
Besides, these two cases

17:34.541 --> 17:36.040
do not have a lot in common.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.957
Don't have a lot in common?

17:38.916 --> 17:40.790
According to your substation's data,

17:40.875 --> 17:43.499
Michelle, this 35-year-old Saleswoman,

17:43.625 --> 17:45.915
also inhaled a large amount of sevoflurane

17:45.916 --> 17:48.540
and had her kidney removed while unconscious.

17:48.541 --> 17:49.832
OK, besides that?

17:49.833 --> 17:50.832
An Asian male,

17:50.833 --> 17:51.915
a Caucasian female,

17:51.916 --> 17:52.749
one missing a heart,

17:52.750 --> 17:54.124
the other a kidney?

17:54.125 --> 17:54.999
My gut feeling tells me

17:55.333 --> 17:56.749
if we don't catch the killer soon,

17:56.791 --> 17:58.124
he will strike again.

17:58.125 --> 17:58.874
Agreed.

18:00.875 --> 18:01.540
Kiko,

18:01.666 --> 18:03.457
Can you access the surveillance video

18:03.458 --> 18:04.790
for the next two days after the crime?

18:04.833 --> 18:05.707
Piece of cake...

18:06.166 --> 18:07.665
You cannot do this!

18:08.333 --> 18:10.207
I will take the responsibility!

18:10.500 --> 18:11.457
But Uncle Seven...

18:12.291 --> 18:13.415
Officer Chen,

18:14.583 --> 18:16.165
I don't have much time left...

18:16.333 --> 18:17.790
Hurry.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.415
Kiko, split the screen,

18:26.416 --> 18:27.707
and get me the surveillance video

18:27.708 --> 18:29.624
of the temple's front gate

18:29.625 --> 18:30.707
for the next 2 days after the crime!

18:30.708 --> 18:31.957
No problem. That'll take some time...

18:31.958 --> 18:32.749
Two days...

18:32.791 --> 18:34.040
too long...

18:35.208 --> 18:35.915
Fast forward.

18:37.208 --> 18:38.165
4 times!

18:39.500 --> 18:40.415
8 times!

18:40.416 --> 18:41.165
16 times!

18:44.375 --> 18:45.332
Come on, Old Chin!

18:45.333 --> 18:47.124
Be the fastest man in the world!

18:47.125 --> 18:47.999
32 times!

18:48.708 --> 18:49.665
32 times!

18:51.791 --> 18:52.957
What are they doing?

18:53.166 --> 18:54.749
81 % of the murderers

18:54.750 --> 18:56.207
will return to their crime scene

18:56.208 --> 18:58.499
to enjoy their "work of art",

18:58.791 --> 19:00.290
except this time it's bad luck

19:00.291 --> 19:02.290
for the killer because of us.

19:02.291 --> 19:03.457
- Stop!
- Stop!

19:04.583 --> 19:05.457
Go back 7 min...

19:05.458 --> 19:06.540
Go back 9 min...

19:07.416 --> 19:08.749
- Stop!
- Stop!

19:08.750 --> 19:09.957
Zoom in on the person next to the police car.

19:09.958 --> 19:12.040
Zoom in on the lower right corner
on the person who's about leave.

19:20.166 --> 19:21.582
I will upload the picture to our database,

19:21.583 --> 19:22.749
we should soon know who he is.

19:22.833 --> 19:24.124
No need, I already found him.

19:25.291 --> 19:26.249
His name is Song Yi.

19:26.250 --> 19:27.415
He arrived in the US two years ago.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.749
His visa has already expired.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.499
- He has a sister named Song Chian
- Illegal immigrant

19:30.500 --> 19:31.915
who came to America two years before he did.

19:31.916 --> 19:33.415
She went missing a year ago,

19:33.500 --> 19:34.415
hasn't been found.

19:34.458 --> 19:35.749
Any other information?

19:35.750 --> 19:36.874
It's all I have for now.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.165
Chinese, male,

19:38.166 --> 19:39.040
right age,

19:39.041 --> 19:40.457
it must be this bastard!

19:40.750 --> 19:42.249
Uncle Seven, let's go get him.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.207
Let's go!

19:43.625 --> 19:44.665
Not fair!

19:44.666 --> 19:46.915
We are the ones who found the guy!

19:46.916 --> 19:48.332
YOU, OUT!

19:50.375 --> 19:51.332
Everyone,

19:51.708 --> 19:54.332
whoever catches this Song Yi

19:54.958 --> 19:57.582
and brings him to me

19:57.791 --> 19:59.665
gets the 5 million,

20:01.833 --> 20:02.957
under one condition:

20:03.583 --> 20:06.957
you must prove he is the real killer.

20:07.708 --> 20:08.999
Alright let's go

20:10.000 --> 20:11.249
I'll head to the station

20:11.250 --> 20:12.499
to get a warrant for his arrest.

20:12.625 --> 20:14.165
Wish you luck.

20:14.416 --> 20:15.207
Officer Chen,

20:15.208 --> 20:16.457
I see romance in your path,

20:16.458 --> 20:18.207
you will meet your true love.

20:18.208 --> 20:19.332
Tell me your birth date

20:19.333 --> 20:20.915
and I'll predict your future marriage.

20:22.250 --> 20:24.207
Only six days left.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.374
If they don't find the killer by then

20:28.375 --> 20:31.707
I will give all my money to the church

20:31.708 --> 20:34.624
and you will get nothing.

20:35.958 --> 20:37.499
Also,

20:38.166 --> 20:41.874
we haven't discussed the things

20:43.208 --> 20:45.874
that you have done behind my back...

20:47.166 --> 20:47.915
Understood.

20:48.458 --> 20:49.124
Understood.

20:49.125 --> 20:50.415
The odds of an innocent person

20:50.416 --> 20:53.124
appearing at both crime scenes

20:53.125 --> 20:54.124
is almost zero,

20:54.125 --> 20:55.332
therefore this case

20:55.333 --> 20:56.707
is basically solved...

20:56.875 --> 20:57.832
boring.

20:58.208 --> 20:59.624
I'm going back to Japan this afternoon.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.374
Let's find

21:01.375 --> 21:03.582
a more difficult case next time,

21:03.708 --> 21:04.540
shall we?

21:04.583 --> 21:06.540
Old Chin, don't be fooled by him.

21:06.583 --> 21:07.957
I could say I'm going to the Moon!

21:09.041 --> 21:10.999
This dude will give up 5 million dollars?

21:11.041 --> 21:12.249
Is he stupid?

21:12.833 --> 21:15.249
Do you know who needs money?

21:15.375 --> 21:17.249
Everyone needs money!

21:17.625 --> 21:18.832
Poor people.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.582
I have WeChat, add me...

21:23.666 --> 21:24.415
OK...

21:25.166 --> 21:26.124
I don't mean to be rude,

21:26.208 --> 21:27.957
but we actually added each other last night.

21:28.125 --> 21:29.707
But you were the one that wanted to add me.

21:29.708 --> 21:30.832
Is there a difference?

21:31.333 --> 21:32.457
See you later,

21:32.458 --> 21:33.207
everyone.

21:33.541 --> 21:34.249
Chin Fong,

21:36.958 --> 21:38.457
have fun hunting!

21:44.125 --> 21:45.290
What is this?

21:45.291 --> 21:46.665
We can team up.

21:46.708 --> 21:48.290
Catch the guy and split the money?

21:49.250 --> 21:51.165
The money is all yours.

21:51.291 --> 21:52.499
What's in it for you?

21:52.666 --> 21:56.915
I don't want anyone messing up my plans.

22:01.541 --> 22:02.957
That guy likes that girl,

22:02.958 --> 22:04.165
and that girl likes you.

22:04.541 --> 22:05.707
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:05.708 --> 22:07.749
New York is huge.
Where will we find the 5 million dollar man?

22:08.125 --> 22:09.165
He is Chinese,

22:09.166 --> 22:10.707
and where does a Chinese go

22:11.125 --> 22:12.290
to survive in New York?

22:12.291 --> 22:13.749
Chinatown?!

22:21.333 --> 22:22.165
Hey...

22:22.166 --> 22:23.790
The Wind & Moon Night Club
is looking for a male escort,

22:24.208 --> 22:25.790
and Xiang Manlou Restaurant
is looking for a cook.

22:28.458 --> 22:29.832
We... are not looking for a job,

22:30.333 --> 22:32.290
bi - bi - big... big... sister...

22:32.291 --> 22:34.582
Big?

22:35.708 --> 22:37.540
I must have scared you, young man.

22:37.541 --> 22:38.582
It's not you!

22:38.583 --> 22:39.957
He was born with the stutters.

22:41.500 --> 22:42.624
Have you ever seen this man before?

22:42.833 --> 22:43.582
NO!

22:44.083 --> 22:44.915
Let's go!

22:49.541 --> 22:50.665
Sister...

22:51.416 --> 22:53.582
OK, young man.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.040
His family name is Song.

22:56.166 --> 22:56.915
Let me tell you...

22:56.958 --> 22:58.915
he switched jobs about 30 times
in just one year...

22:59.375 --> 23:01.124
What a dumbass.

23:03.625 --> 23:04.874
All of his files are here,

23:04.958 --> 23:06.249
you can go through them yourselves.

23:10.916 --> 23:11.832
Young man,

23:12.083 --> 23:14.165
has a handsome guy like you

23:14.500 --> 23:15.957
ever thought about taking a part time job

23:16.041 --> 23:16.874
in Chinatown?

23:16.958 --> 23:17.665
Shut up,

23:17.750 --> 23:18.457
you're distracting him!

23:18.750 --> 23:19.624
Bah!

23:20.333 --> 23:21.665
Come, come closer.

23:22.541 --> 23:23.290
Look at you,

23:24.208 --> 23:26.082
what a gloomy face.

23:26.583 --> 23:27.874
Disaster will befall you

23:28.041 --> 23:29.415
within three days!

23:31.041 --> 23:32.540
Are you trying to tell my fortune?

23:32.666 --> 23:33.749
When I started this business

23:33.750 --> 23:34.957
you hadn't got your period!

23:35.291 --> 23:36.999
You know what?

23:37.333 --> 23:39.040
The disaster is right there.

23:39.125 --> 23:40.124
Pervert!

23:40.208 --> 23:41.749
This is a nation of laws.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.207
I'll call the police!

23:43.375 --> 23:44.165
Let's go!

23:46.291 --> 23:48.165
How can you find a person with just a phone?

23:48.750 --> 23:51.040
We're gonna lose our 5 million.

23:51.416 --> 23:52.707
You care about the 5 million,

23:53.541 --> 23:55.249
but I just want to know why he did it.

24:00.916 --> 24:02.374
What are you doing?

24:35.458 --> 24:36.999
The Manhattan Distance

24:37.208 --> 24:38.790
is a mathematical model with

24:38.791 --> 24:40.707
which I can accurately calculate
the murderer's place of residence.

24:41.041 --> 24:43.040
I changed the crime scene to his work place

24:43.041 --> 24:44.124
and got the same result.

24:44.541 --> 24:45.665
When I apply the X and Y coordinates

24:45.666 --> 24:47.457
of the crime scene into the formula,

24:47.708 --> 24:49.165
it reveals the killer's pattern.

24:49.333 --> 24:50.707
I can then use it
to further derive the probability

24:50.708 --> 24:51.999
of his whereabouts.

24:52.166 --> 24:53.832
The dots with the highest probabilities are
connecting and forming a zone,

24:53.958 --> 24:55.207
which is most likely

24:55.208 --> 24:56.707
where the criminal lives!

25:00.083 --> 25:01.290
I found it!

25:18.041 --> 25:20.374
We're gonna capture this sicko soon,

25:20.541 --> 25:21.915
I'm getting excited.

25:23.125 --> 25:25.415
Everyone says America produces serial killers,

25:25.541 --> 25:26.874
do they all look alike?

25:27.000 --> 25:27.749
Generally speaking,

25:28.250 --> 25:30.165
serial killers all have
the three "McDonald" elements...

25:30.208 --> 25:31.582
Coke, burger and fries?

25:32.375 --> 25:33.624
I'm getting hungry.

25:33.958 --> 25:36.207
Bed wetting, arson and animal abuse.

25:37.041 --> 25:37.790
Cut into strips...

25:37.958 --> 25:39.499
Cut into strips...

25:40.250 --> 25:41.124
Cut into slices...

25:41.208 --> 25:42.540
Cut into slices...

25:43.125 --> 25:44.249
Cut into cubes...

25:44.250 --> 25:45.332
Cut into cubes...

25:45.333 --> 25:47.249
What entree (Zhu3 Shi2) would you like?

25:47.333 --> 25:50.290
What pig slop (Zhu1 Shi2) would you like?

25:50.500 --> 25:52.374
It's

25:53.458 --> 25:54.707
entrée (Zhu3 Shi2),

25:55.125 --> 25:56.874
not pig slop (Zhu1 Shi2)...

25:56.875 --> 26:00.499
It's pig slop (zhu1 shi2)...

26:00.708 --> 26:02.207
Pig (zhu1 )...

26:07.583 --> 26:08.874
Entrée,

26:08.875 --> 26:10.332
not pig slop.

26:10.333 --> 26:11.957
Pig slop.

26:12.250 --> 26:13.040
Wrong.

26:13.750 --> 26:14.665
What's wrong?

26:15.291 --> 26:17.832
Remember we said the murderer's left handed?

26:18.291 --> 26:19.874
This Song Yi is right handed.

26:36.541 --> 26:37.999
Do you wet the bed?

26:39.625 --> 26:41.082
No.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.374
Have done it before.

26:44.166 --> 26:45.582
I knew it,

26:45.750 --> 26:46.790
you sicko!

26:46.916 --> 26:48.040
You also set things on fire

26:48.166 --> 26:49.749
and kill small animals, don't you?

26:49.750 --> 26:50.665
You also kill people.

26:50.666 --> 26:51.499
Not only kill people,

26:51.500 --> 26:53.290
you take out their kidneys and hearts.

26:53.541 --> 26:54.915
Cut into strips, cut into slices

26:55.000 --> 26:56.415
and cut into cubes?

27:02.416 --> 27:03.207
Everyone,

27:03.208 --> 27:04.665
it's a misunderstanding,

27:04.666 --> 27:05.499
a joke.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.707
Just a joke?

27:06.708 --> 27:08.040
Who are you?

27:09.291 --> 27:10.332
You don't remember?

27:10.541 --> 27:11.707
It's me, little Tang.

27:11.916 --> 27:14.332
When we were children,
we used to pee together.

27:15.083 --> 27:16.582
I used to wet the bed way more than he did.

27:16.583 --> 27:18.207
And I peed higher than him,

27:18.875 --> 27:20.082
farther than you...

27:21.666 --> 27:22.540
It's all your fault.

27:22.791 --> 27:24.124
What do we do now?

27:24.375 --> 27:26.999
All this bed wetting talk made me wanna pee!

27:33.166 --> 27:34.499
We were wrong,

27:35.375 --> 27:36.290
he's not the murderer.

27:36.583 --> 27:37.915
I don't care if he's the murderer or not.

27:37.916 --> 27:39.457
We get him, we get the 5 million!

27:39.500 --> 27:40.499
In your dreams.

27:40.583 --> 27:41.499
Uncle Seven made it clear:

27:41.666 --> 27:43.165
we must prove he's the murderer.

27:44.250 --> 27:45.457
And why isn't he?

27:45.458 --> 27:46.832
Just because he's not a lefty?

27:46.833 --> 27:47.707
Of course my instincts also say no!

27:47.708 --> 27:49.415
My instinct says he's our guy!

28:04.625 --> 28:05.499
Mr. Song,

28:06.208 --> 28:07.165
nice to meet you.

28:07.583 --> 28:08.415
Take him!

28:09.083 --> 28:09.749
Hurry up!

28:15.000 --> 28:15.707
Students,

28:16.041 --> 28:16.874
my students!

28:23.166 --> 28:23.999
Students,

28:24.000 --> 28:24.874
students!

28:25.125 --> 28:27.040
Time to fight the bad guys!

28:27.250 --> 28:28.624
Help me!

28:28.708 --> 28:30.790
I am your teacher.

28:30.791 --> 28:32.332
You are greatly indebted to me!

28:32.333 --> 28:33.374
Students,

28:33.375 --> 28:34.290
shoot,

28:34.291 --> 28:35.457
shoot them!

28:35.458 --> 28:36.457
Shut your mouth!

28:36.458 --> 28:38.457
- Students...
- Gag him!

28:39.250 --> 28:39.874
Gag him!

28:56.083 --> 28:56.957
Boss..

29:13.083 --> 29:14.665
Take that!

29:17.083 --> 29:18.582
Get out.

29:25.125 --> 29:26.290
Release the bastard

29:26.625 --> 29:28.082
on the way back.

29:28.125 --> 29:30.040
Release him first

29:31.958 --> 29:32.790
Release him?

29:33.541 --> 29:35.124
Then catch him,

29:35.333 --> 29:36.582
and kill him.

29:37.833 --> 29:38.624
I see...

29:38.958 --> 29:40.249
A dead man cannot defend himself.

29:40.250 --> 29:42.707
So Uncle Seven will have to
believe he's the murderer,

29:42.708 --> 29:43.499
right?

29:45.291 --> 29:47.832
Kid, you are way too smart...

29:48.708 --> 29:49.665
Watch and learn.

29:58.791 --> 30:01.332
Do I laugh like a bad guy?

30:01.416 --> 30:02.457
Actually, Boss,

30:02.458 --> 30:03.999
you look more like a bad guy
when you are not laughing!

30:16.166 --> 30:17.707
They're gonna kill him!

30:18.625 --> 30:20.124
You are going to lose the person and the money.

30:20.125 --> 30:20.999
Old Chin,

30:21.125 --> 30:22.290
in the name of justice,

30:22.291 --> 30:24.790
we cannot just let them get away with this!

30:24.958 --> 30:26.207
In the name of justice? You sure?

30:26.375 --> 30:27.874
Let's save him. Now!

30:27.875 --> 30:29.665
Aren't you afraid they'll know it's us?

30:32.708 --> 30:34.124
Go and see.

30:34.583 --> 30:35.749
What?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.499
Let's go!

30:51.458 --> 30:53.499
Think this dumb lunk understands any Chinese?

30:53.541 --> 30:54.540
Try him!

30:57.000 --> 30:57.707
Brother,

30:58.125 --> 30:58.957
what's your name?

30:59.500 --> 31:01.082
I don't speak Chinese.

31:04.083 --> 31:05.707
I can teach you a few words,

31:05.833 --> 31:07.082
what do you wanna learn?

31:10.333 --> 31:12.040
Bastard, don't run!

31:12.291 --> 31:13.582
How do you say that?

31:15.750 --> 31:16.499
Daddy!

31:16.541 --> 31:17.457
Hit me!

31:18.083 --> 31:18.790
Daddy!

31:19.166 --> 31:20.040
Hit me!

31:20.208 --> 31:20.874
Yeah.

31:21.541 --> 31:22.999
Daddy! Hit me!

31:24.666 --> 31:25.874
Daddy! Hit me!

31:26.000 --> 31:27.040
Daddy! Hit me!

31:27.416 --> 31:28.415
Daddy! Hit me!

31:28.416 --> 31:29.457
Daddy! Hit me!

31:33.916 --> 31:34.790
Donald Duck

31:36.000 --> 31:37.374
That's a chicken.

31:39.500 --> 31:40.499
"Dog shit!"

31:40.666 --> 31:41.915
"Let horse come on!"

31:42.666 --> 31:43.540
What's he saying?

31:43.708 --> 31:45.290
He says "bullshit, wanna fight?"

31:46.333 --> 31:48.249
"Give you face, you don't want!"

31:49.458 --> 31:50.499
I told him, "you are shameless!"

31:50.500 --> 31:51.415
"Dog leg!"

31:51.708 --> 31:53.082
He says we are tools!

31:53.625 --> 31:54.624
"Dog son!"

31:55.583 --> 31:56.874
"Kiss my ass!"

31:58.500 --> 31:59.999
"Give him some color."

32:00.583 --> 32:01.415
What?

32:30.666 --> 32:31.874
Come, let's beat them up.

32:31.875 --> 32:33.124
Okay, okay, let's go.

32:36.333 --> 32:37.207
Stay here.

32:37.958 --> 32:38.707
Get them!

32:59.416 --> 33:00.290
Spider man?

33:00.458 --> 33:01.915
They're gonna kill you, run!

33:01.916 --> 33:03.499
Hurry up.

33:04.666 --> 33:06.707
Catch them!

33:06.750 --> 33:07.957
Come on!

33:08.208 --> 33:09.082
Catch them!

33:11.041 --> 33:12.957
The chicken too!

33:20.458 --> 33:21.499
Keep running!

33:35.208 --> 33:36.374
Daddy! Hit me!

33:36.375 --> 33:37.249
What?!

33:46.833 --> 33:47.707
Tang Ren?!

33:48.250 --> 33:49.707
It's not me! Not me!

33:49.708 --> 33:51.499
Kill him!

34:04.041 --> 34:05.040
Honey!

34:08.083 --> 34:09.248
Get down!

34:57.875 --> 34:59.207
Catch them all!

35:19.333 --> 35:20.207
This way!

35:27.541 --> 35:28.332
This way!

35:28.583 --> 35:29.457
There they are.

35:29.500 --> 35:30.582
Catch them!

35:30.583 --> 35:31.832
Catch 'em all!

35:56.958 --> 35:59.249
I want the three naked guys!

36:18.583 --> 36:19.957
You wanna mess with me?

36:20.583 --> 36:22.874
I want the three Chinese men!

36:52.333 --> 36:53.040
Hello?

36:53.416 --> 36:54.749
Uncle Seven?

36:55.625 --> 36:56.624
You just had a baby?!

36:56.625 --> 36:57.499
I'll be right there.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.249
You are getting marry tomorrow?!

36:59.250 --> 37:00.499
Of course I'll be there.

38:03.333 --> 38:06.124
You gotta take the bullet, kid...

39:11.666 --> 39:12.624
Don't tell anyone

39:12.708 --> 39:13.999
about what happened in there.

39:14.583 --> 39:16.665
- What happened in there?
- Stop it!

39:17.541 --> 39:18.415
Stop it!

39:18.833 --> 39:19.915
What the hell are you laughing at?

39:19.916 --> 39:21.915
I was trying to save you!

39:22.208 --> 39:23.707
Why are they after me?

39:23.708 --> 39:24.707
Because you killed someone,

39:24.750 --> 39:25.832
sicko!

39:25.916 --> 39:27.374
Who did I kill?

39:27.833 --> 39:29.749
Zao Wang Temple and East River.

39:30.041 --> 39:31.332
Why were you at the crime scenes?

39:32.083 --> 39:33.290
I'm a detective,

39:33.458 --> 39:34.999
of course I'm interested in homicides.

39:35.416 --> 39:36.374
You're a detective?

39:36.541 --> 39:38.624
You are a freaking detective?

39:40.375 --> 39:41.707
Have you heard of "Crimaster"?

39:42.000 --> 39:42.915
Master of Crimes.

39:43.333 --> 39:44.874
I'm on it.

39:45.208 --> 39:46.707
What's your ranking?

39:46.916 --> 39:48.790
Currently around #1000...

39:48.791 --> 39:49.832
# 1998?

39:49.875 --> 39:51.790
1998 is around 1000?

39:51.875 --> 39:53.999
Do you know how difficult it is?

39:54.041 --> 39:56.624
Took me a year and half
to answer the 99 entry questions!

39:56.833 --> 39:57.915
But enough about me,

39:58.125 --> 40:00.124
what do you guys do?

40:00.125 --> 40:01.207
You say you are on Crimaster

40:01.250 --> 40:02.374
and you don't know who he is?

40:02.833 --> 40:04.082
Have you heard of Chin Fong?

40:04.875 --> 40:05.749
Chin Fong?

40:06.458 --> 40:07.290
Yes.

40:07.666 --> 40:08.540
You are my idol!

40:10.333 --> 40:11.290
...and you are?

40:11.583 --> 40:12.790
Chin Fong is my assistant,

40:12.875 --> 40:14.582
I'm just a tad better than him.

40:16.708 --> 40:17.540
Q?

40:18.083 --> 40:19.124
The legendary "Q"?!

40:19.208 --> 40:20.499
"Q" my ass!

40:20.833 --> 40:21.707
I'm Tang Ren,

40:22.208 --> 40:24.499
world-renowned Chinatown detective,

40:24.500 --> 40:25.415
Tang Ren!

40:26.708 --> 40:27.582
Tang Ren?

40:27.958 --> 40:28.832
Yes.

40:29.375 --> 40:30.499
Never heard of it.

40:30.666 --> 40:31.665
Enough chitchat.

40:31.666 --> 40:32.415
Old Chin,

40:32.416 --> 40:33.832
let's bring him to Uncle Seven

40:33.875 --> 40:35.540
and claim our 5 million.

40:35.666 --> 40:36.540
He's not the murderer.

40:36.708 --> 40:37.999
You can't get that money.

40:38.416 --> 40:39.957
You can't just say that

40:39.958 --> 40:41.040
based on one hand.

40:41.083 --> 40:41.915
What hand?

40:42.250 --> 40:43.332
Where were you

40:43.333 --> 40:44.582
on the night of June 30th

40:44.625 --> 40:45.499
and the following morning?

40:45.500 --> 40:47.124
I was working in a bar the whole time.

40:47.125 --> 40:47.874
Do you have any proof?

40:48.625 --> 40:50.415
I have witnesses.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.999
Tell that to the police.

40:54.583 --> 40:56.040
Don't take me to the cops,

40:56.291 --> 40:57.290
I'm here illegally,

40:57.291 --> 40:59.332
I don't give a shit if you're illegal or not.

40:59.708 --> 41:00.415
Alright.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.665
Did you forget
what happened to you in Thailand?

41:02.666 --> 41:04.624
Old Chin, I... but I'm your uncle!

41:05.250 --> 41:06.582
Listen, you want the money,

41:06.625 --> 41:07.707
I want the truth,

41:07.875 --> 41:08.957
the best way is

41:08.958 --> 41:10.082
to find the real murderer.

41:10.083 --> 41:11.582
- Agreed!
- Agreed my ass,

41:11.666 --> 41:12.540
Say it again?

41:12.958 --> 41:14.082
So... what do you suggest we do with him?

41:14.458 --> 41:15.540
Both the cops

41:15.541 --> 41:16.499
and the goons are after him.

41:16.500 --> 41:17.749
You can't get rid of me.

41:17.958 --> 41:18.790
The great Chin Fong will uncover the truth

41:18.791 --> 41:19.790
and prove my innocence.

41:20.208 --> 41:21.207
You really think you're with us now?

41:21.208 --> 41:21.999
Not you,

41:22.000 --> 41:23.040
I'm with Chin Fong.

41:24.583 --> 41:25.457
Say it again?

41:34.625 --> 41:35.749
Again?

41:36.000 --> 41:38.040
We can't investigate wearing this.

41:38.416 --> 41:39.374
Be careful,

41:39.458 --> 41:40.540
this is America.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.332
So what?

41:50.416 --> 41:51.915
Sleep tight!

41:52.125 --> 41:54.124
We have a busy day tomorrow.

41:54.125 --> 41:55.165
Sleep my ass!

41:55.708 --> 41:57.165
Last night I was in a huge mansion,

41:57.333 --> 41:59.124
now because of you look where I am!

41:59.500 --> 42:00.499
Give me back my 5 million.

42:00.833 --> 42:01.832
Stop hitting me!

42:02.125 --> 42:03.540
I've had it with you.

42:03.833 --> 42:04.665
Yeah?

42:05.000 --> 42:06.124
You've had it...?

42:08.375 --> 42:09.290
Stop it, you two!

42:10.041 --> 42:11.207
Just sleep while you can,

42:12.000 --> 42:13.374
I'm afraid later we won't be able to.

42:14.833 --> 42:15.874
It won't be that bad, will it?

42:16.458 --> 42:17.374
First,

42:17.500 --> 42:18.415
time is running,

42:18.458 --> 42:19.457
we have 5 days left.

42:20.083 --> 42:21.124
Second, I have a feeling

42:21.458 --> 42:22.749
that the murderer will soon strike again.

42:42.541 --> 42:43.582
What are you, a boy band?

42:44.541 --> 42:45.582
Chinese?

42:48.125 --> 42:49.082
This is a robbery!

42:50.958 --> 42:52.207
Are you kidding me?

42:52.916 --> 42:54.957
What's left to rob?

42:55.708 --> 42:56.749
Cut the bullshit.

42:56.958 --> 42:57.999
This is a robbery.

43:46.208 --> 43:47.290
5th Avenue.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.707
Right under our President's Trump Tower.

43:49.708 --> 43:51.957
What is this, some Chinese circus?

43:51.958 --> 43:53.332
One is our main suspect, Song Yi.

43:53.333 --> 43:54.624
The other two were hired by Uncle Seven.

43:54.625 --> 43:56.499
I don't know how they got together.

43:56.541 --> 43:57.749
Why hire these idiots?

43:57.750 --> 43:58.832
Are we useless?

43:58.833 --> 44:00.915
Can these Chinese handle this case?

44:01.125 --> 44:02.957
Don't let these so called detectives

44:02.958 --> 44:04.457
get in our way or we'll lock' em up!

44:04.458 --> 44:05.249
And issue a warrant

44:05.250 --> 44:06.332
for these two's arrest!

44:06.333 --> 44:07.665
But they're detectives, not criminals.

44:07.666 --> 44:08.540
Shut up!

44:08.541 --> 44:10.040
They are if they're with the criminal!

44:10.041 --> 44:12.374
The President should
build another wall on the West Coast

44:12.416 --> 44:13.832
to keep these fobs out.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.457
The white female lost her kidney,

44:24.750 --> 44:26.457
the Asian male lost his heart,

44:26.708 --> 44:27.999
there is no correlation between the two!

44:28.166 --> 44:29.124
If we find it

44:29.500 --> 44:30.999
we can crack this case.

44:31.416 --> 44:32.249
I warn you, 5 Million,

44:32.416 --> 44:34.040
do not steal my lines!

44:34.333 --> 44:35.874
The report indicates
this is not the primary crime scene.

44:36.666 --> 44:38.457
The river dragged the body here.

44:38.791 --> 44:40.874
- The river...
- East River's so long,

44:41.083 --> 44:42.207
where do we start looking?

44:43.291 --> 44:44.374
Damn it, you are still stealing!

44:45.458 --> 44:46.374
This will tell us.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.624
The water's speed is 0.4 meters per second.

44:49.916 --> 44:51.665
Based on the time of death and the time
the body was discovered

44:51.666 --> 44:52.832
we can calculate...

44:52.833 --> 44:53.999
It should be here!

44:55.958 --> 44:57.540
That's a residential area,

44:57.541 --> 44:59.124
an unlikely place to commit a crime.

44:59.625 --> 45:00.874
I'm thinking

45:00.875 --> 45:02.207
its farther upstream,

45:02.291 --> 45:03.290
somewhere around here.

45:03.625 --> 45:04.665
It's...

45:07.333 --> 45:09.290
Go ahead, I'm not gonna steal your lines.

45:12.833 --> 45:13.957
I don't want the money any more,

45:13.958 --> 45:15.415
I'm calling Lu Guofu now.

45:15.916 --> 45:17.457
An abandoned ship factory.

45:53.208 --> 45:54.124
This is it!

45:54.250 --> 45:55.832
What's with the blood trail?

45:56.458 --> 45:57.999
I thought the killer had
dumped the body into the river,

45:58.708 --> 45:59.415
but it seems

46:00.083 --> 46:02.040
the victim crawled there herself.

46:02.458 --> 46:03.624
Crawled there herself...

46:03.791 --> 46:05.957
But if she wanted to live,
wouldn't she crawl this way?

46:33.708 --> 46:34.874
There's only one explanation.

46:35.708 --> 46:37.040
The killer was standing right here!

46:37.291 --> 46:38.957
This is the first time he used sevoflurane.

46:39.166 --> 46:40.499
He must have used too little,

46:41.041 --> 46:42.665
so after removing the kidney,

46:43.291 --> 46:44.249
she woke up.

46:45.791 --> 46:46.957
How cruel.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.249
So the East River crime scene

46:48.250 --> 46:49.707
was just a coincidence?

46:50.333 --> 46:51.499
Notify your Officer Chen,

46:52.125 --> 46:53.124
don't let them fall behind too much.

46:55.208 --> 46:56.374
My Officer Chen?

46:56.625 --> 46:58.040
Old Chin, say it again.

46:58.750 --> 46:59.915
Whose? She's mine...

47:03.375 --> 47:04.540
It's that symbol again,

47:04.875 --> 47:06.832
this is a serial killer as expected.

47:07.041 --> 47:08.207
We need to find someone

47:09.083 --> 47:10.457
who knows what this means!

47:11.208 --> 47:13.415
Looks like we gotta go to my master.

47:13.666 --> 47:14.832
Your... master?

47:16.000 --> 47:16.749
That's right.

47:16.916 --> 47:18.957
The expert on astronomy, geography,

47:19.041 --> 47:20.582
music, literature and painting.

47:20.833 --> 47:22.332
The wisest man.

47:22.333 --> 47:23.332
The 46th generation descendant

47:23.416 --> 47:24.582
of the South Style Mojia boxing:

47:24.958 --> 47:26.624
Mo You-Chian!

47:29.333 --> 47:30.999
Is this place going out of business?

47:31.000 --> 47:32.124
Stop talking shit.

47:32.916 --> 47:34.499
I'll show you how great my master is!

47:34.500 --> 47:35.457
See,

47:38.166 --> 47:39.540
how impressive!

47:40.625 --> 47:42.082
How come they all look photoshopped?

47:42.250 --> 47:43.249
If you don't shut up

47:43.333 --> 47:44.374
I'll cut you in half!

47:49.916 --> 47:50.749
Listen,

47:50.833 --> 47:53.624
your should move your body more aggressively.

47:54.166 --> 47:55.707
Look! My master!

47:55.708 --> 47:57.290
Still teaching online at this age,

47:57.291 --> 47:59.790
with students all over the world.

47:59.833 --> 48:00.582
Relax,

48:00.583 --> 48:02.415
be bolder.

48:05.625 --> 48:06.790
He sure is your master.

48:09.875 --> 48:11.040
Master!

48:11.625 --> 48:12.499
Signing up?

48:12.541 --> 48:13.832
$20 per class.

48:13.833 --> 48:15.749
10 classes get 20% off, 20 classes get 30% off.

48:15.875 --> 48:17.832
Extra discount with
China Merchants Bank credit card.

48:18.916 --> 48:20.082
Master,

48:20.125 --> 48:21.290
It's me, Tang Ren.

48:21.333 --> 48:22.207
It's been so long.

48:22.208 --> 48:23.499
I missed you so much.

48:26.125 --> 48:27.082
Tang Ren?

48:27.125 --> 48:27.874
Yes!

48:31.583 --> 48:33.374
What a pretty girl,

48:34.166 --> 48:35.665
what's your name?

48:36.666 --> 48:38.124
I am a man.

48:39.416 --> 48:40.290
Oh...

48:41.166 --> 48:42.290
I'm getting too old,

48:42.291 --> 48:43.707
my mind's a bit rusty.

48:46.250 --> 48:47.249
Who did you say

48:47.333 --> 48:48.290
you were?

48:48.291 --> 48:49.457
Tang Ren, master...

48:49.833 --> 48:50.624
Tang Ren?

48:50.625 --> 48:52.207
You don't recognize me?

48:53.125 --> 48:53.832
Oh...

48:53.916 --> 48:55.540
What a pretty girl,

48:55.791 --> 48:57.249
what's your name?

48:57.333 --> 48:59.040
I think we came to the wrong place.

48:59.791 --> 49:01.082
Just ask him the question.

49:02.000 --> 49:02.790
Master,

49:03.291 --> 49:04.040
can you help me

49:04.041 --> 49:05.499
understand what it means?

49:07.583 --> 49:08.957
What's your name?

49:11.166 --> 49:12.249
My name is Chin Fong.

49:12.250 --> 49:13.832
Little Fong,

49:13.916 --> 49:15.790
what a pretty girl.

49:17.958 --> 49:18.874
Yes, master,

49:19.208 --> 49:20.915
can you please help me

49:20.916 --> 49:22.040
understand what this symbol means?

49:23.958 --> 49:25.124
This one...

49:26.041 --> 49:27.540
should be an evil,

49:27.541 --> 49:29.832
ancient Chinese "soul trapping" talisman.

49:29.875 --> 49:30.874
Soul trapping?

49:32.041 --> 49:32.957
What does it do exactly?

49:32.958 --> 49:36.124
Usually, this talisman is used by

49:36.125 --> 49:38.540
killers afraid of their victim's spirit

49:38.541 --> 49:40.999
coming back to haunt them.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.332
So they use the talisman

49:42.333 --> 49:43.957
to trap the spirit

49:43.958 --> 49:45.165
where it was killed,

49:46.208 --> 49:48.332
forever.

49:48.458 --> 49:49.999
This is a very unusual

49:50.750 --> 49:52.999
and evil

49:53.208 --> 49:54.374
practice.

49:55.083 --> 49:56.249
I remember

49:56.500 --> 49:58.749
there is a book that

49:58.750 --> 50:00.457
talks about it in detail.

50:00.458 --> 50:02.707
Master, please remember, which book?

50:09.916 --> 50:11.832
What a pretty girl...

50:12.583 --> 50:14.374
Can you stop saying that?

50:14.916 --> 50:15.707
...Master,

50:16.000 --> 50:17.790
Think, which book mentions this symbol?

50:18.416 --> 50:19.582
Yin Yang Wu Ji Shuo.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.499
You can find it in

50:21.541 --> 50:23.040
the NYC library!

50:41.833 --> 50:42.665
Found it!

50:45.041 --> 50:45.915
Is it this one?

50:49.708 --> 50:50.457
Yes,

50:50.541 --> 50:51.540
this is the one,

50:51.666 --> 50:52.874
just as Master Mo said.

50:56.791 --> 50:57.790
Someone ripped it off.

50:58.375 --> 50:59.332
What could it be?

51:00.166 --> 51:01.124
Maybe it's the key

51:01.791 --> 51:02.957
to this whole case.

51:03.625 --> 51:04.790
You're overthinking.

51:05.208 --> 51:06.374
Probably someone needed toilet paper

51:06.500 --> 51:07.915
when they were reading in the bathroom.

51:08.291 --> 51:10.457
Excellent reasoning!

51:10.458 --> 51:11.707
They don't call me Detective Chinatown

51:11.791 --> 51:12.957
for no reason!

51:16.625 --> 51:17.832
"Can you do me a favor?"

51:17.833 --> 51:18.582
"Say it"

51:19.375 --> 51:21.040
"New York Public Library,
the borrowing record of a book"

51:21.125 --> 51:22.040
"OK, send me the title"

51:22.041 --> 51:23.207
"ls everything ok?"

51:23.208 --> 51:24.124
"Our work are suspended by NYPD"

51:24.125 --> 51:25.499
"Everyone starts their holiday"

51:25.500 --> 51:27.832
"Only you two have
special rights, so keep going!"

51:28.000 --> 51:29.457
"We have special rights?"

51:29.541 --> 51:33.582
"Don't you know you two
are police's wanted person?"

51:36.333 --> 51:37.540
We're wanted by the police.

51:38.083 --> 51:38.790
What?

51:39.083 --> 51:40.124
Why do they want us?

51:40.125 --> 51:41.374
We haven't committed any crime.

51:42.416 --> 51:43.582
We're on the run with the suspect,

51:44.041 --> 51:45.040
of course we are wanted too!

51:47.375 --> 51:49.749
I'm wanted again,

51:49.750 --> 51:50.957
- all because of you!
- Alright.

51:51.250 --> 51:52.540
Forget it, there's no turning back now.

51:52.958 --> 51:53.957
We have to find the real killer

51:54.208 --> 51:55.207
to prove our innocence.

51:59.083 --> 52:00.999
I've discovered the best use

52:01.000 --> 52:01.957
for this book!

52:01.958 --> 52:03.749
It perfectly covers the noodles!

52:07.708 --> 52:08.749
Hurry up and eat it

52:08.875 --> 52:12.207
"Sending you the borrowing record.
There is a person you can't think of."

52:29.708 --> 52:30.790
"Can you help me check what's
on the missing page of this book?"

52:30.791 --> 52:31.790
"Boss I'm not your employee. Sleep now."

52:31.791 --> 52:32.665
"Talk to you tomorrow"

52:32.666 --> 52:34.082
"This is crucial. Please be sure
to check it for me tomorrow."

52:34.083 --> 52:36.082
"You didn't even say "thank you".
Are we that close?"

52:36.083 --> 52:37.249
"Thank you."

52:37.250 --> 52:38.957
"People with high IQ are all low at EQ?"

52:41.666 --> 52:42.540
Are you flirting?

52:42.750 --> 52:43.957
Who told you that?

52:44.208 --> 52:45.624
How can you waste time on flirting?

52:46.041 --> 52:47.290
I can always tell when you lie.

52:48.041 --> 52:49.040
We have no more leads,

52:49.416 --> 52:50.332
what's next?

52:51.666 --> 52:52.832
Find a place to sleep.

52:53.541 --> 52:54.707
We are wanted fugitives,

52:54.708 --> 52:56.040
we can't stay in hotels.

52:56.500 --> 52:57.665
Hotel my ass.

52:58.291 --> 53:00.582
I had to ask Master Mo
for money to get the noodles.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.290
There's a park nearby.

53:02.625 --> 53:04.040
The benches are not bad to sleep on.

53:04.458 --> 53:05.165
God damn it,

53:05.166 --> 53:06.124
because of you,

53:06.125 --> 53:07.457
all I do is sleep in tunnels and parks.

53:08.000 --> 53:08.874
Let's go.

53:22.625 --> 53:23.790
Song Yi,

53:24.583 --> 53:26.832
Why did you come to America?

53:28.333 --> 53:29.499
For the American Dream.

53:29.750 --> 53:32.124
You're an illegal immigrant,
you get no American Dream.

53:34.041 --> 53:35.290
You have a sister.

53:35.625 --> 53:37.040
She went missing a year ago.

53:38.166 --> 53:39.249
What happened?

53:39.625 --> 53:40.790
Just went missing,

53:41.000 --> 53:42.832
disappeared into thin air.

53:45.541 --> 53:47.540
New York is a beautiful city,

53:48.958 --> 53:50.124
but it has another name...

53:52.041 --> 53:53.207
Sin city?

53:54.125 --> 53:55.999
There are lots of hidden dangers here.

53:57.291 --> 53:59.499
Especially for people like us.

54:00.458 --> 54:01.624
Aren't you a detective?

54:01.625 --> 54:02.707
Why don't you go look for her?

54:26.916 --> 54:28.082
Get him!

54:28.833 --> 54:30.040
Call the cops, save the victim!

56:35.916 --> 56:37.082
5 million?!

56:38.083 --> 56:38.915
Are you OK?

56:39.291 --> 56:40.707
Did you see his face?

56:40.708 --> 56:42.207
Chin Fong... Tang Ren...

56:42.208 --> 56:43.457
Here!

56:46.041 --> 56:47.207
The victim is dead.

56:47.625 --> 56:48.540
Where's the killer?

56:48.791 --> 56:49.665
He got away!

56:53.166 --> 56:53.957
Song Yi,

56:55.000 --> 56:56.790
is there anything you're hiding from us?

56:57.791 --> 56:58.540
OK,

56:59.541 --> 57:00.499
I will tell you everything.

57:03.291 --> 57:04.040
I'd already read the book

57:04.041 --> 57:05.374
you were looking for. A few days ago...

57:05.375 --> 57:06.874
- What?
- Let him speak!

57:06.875 --> 57:09.665
Because someone told me it had a clue.

57:09.666 --> 57:10.457
Who?

57:10.458 --> 57:11.207
Q...

57:11.916 --> 57:13.832
- Q?
- The Preserved Egg ranked No.1?

57:13.958 --> 57:14.582
Yes.

57:14.708 --> 57:15.665
He's also the one

57:15.666 --> 57:17.874
who told me
about the two crime scenes I visited.

57:17.875 --> 57:18.915
He's not in the US,

57:18.916 --> 57:20.957
but he's highly interested in the case.

57:21.333 --> 57:22.332
How did you guys make contact?

57:22.416 --> 57:23.624
Crimaster's Private Chat.

57:23.750 --> 57:25.207
Have you been in touch recently?

57:25.666 --> 57:26.582
Ever since I'm wanted,

57:26.583 --> 57:28.040
he stopped replying.

57:29.416 --> 57:31.165
Shit, I'm in this position because of him.

57:31.166 --> 57:32.207
I know!

57:32.708 --> 57:33.749
Could the killer

57:33.750 --> 57:35.165
be "Q"?

57:35.583 --> 57:37.749
He set you up,

57:38.166 --> 57:39.874
just like how I got set up in Thailand.

57:39.875 --> 57:40.790
What? Could that be?

57:43.791 --> 57:44.957
It's possible.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.624
Otherwise what's his purpose?

57:47.708 --> 57:49.457
He is the No.1 detective.

57:49.500 --> 57:50.749
My idol!

57:50.791 --> 57:51.957
He's No.1?

57:51.958 --> 57:54.415
That's because I didn't play
that "PPT" with you guys.

57:54.958 --> 57:56.040
This case just gets more and more interesting.

57:56.041 --> 57:57.915
Old Chin, where do we go now?

57:58.583 --> 57:59.749
Back to the crime scene.

58:00.291 --> 58:01.790
We need to know more about the victim.

58:17.875 --> 58:19.040
What a baby.

58:21.375 --> 58:22.540
- Thank you.
- You are welcome

58:37.833 --> 58:39.332
You OK?

58:40.083 --> 58:40.874
Sorry.

58:40.875 --> 58:42.624
It's another anonymous caller?

58:42.625 --> 58:43.415
Yeah.

58:44.208 --> 58:45.665
I'm sorry you have to see me like this.

58:45.666 --> 58:47.290
It's perfectly normal,

58:47.541 --> 58:50.582
I don't think women
should have to see that type of thing.

58:52.541 --> 58:53.415
Want some gum?

58:53.416 --> 58:54.040
Yeah.

58:54.916 --> 58:55.749
Thanks.

58:55.750 --> 58:57.207
Remember, no breakfast next time.

58:57.208 --> 59:01.249
That's the trick. It stops the puking stuff.

59:01.250 --> 59:02.457
It's fine.

59:09.375 --> 59:10.540
Shit, how did the cops get here so fast?

59:10.958 --> 59:12.124
Didn't you ask me to call them?

59:12.208 --> 59:13.124
Did I?

59:13.166 --> 59:14.957
You did. "Call the cops, save the victim!"

59:16.166 --> 59:17.749
Do you do whatever I tell you to?

59:17.750 --> 59:18.707
I want you to get me 5 million,

59:18.708 --> 59:19.540
can you do that?

59:19.541 --> 59:20.540
You two stop it,

59:22.041 --> 59:23.499
did you see what organ the victim is missing?

59:24.083 --> 59:25.999
It was so dark and I was scared.

59:27.208 --> 59:29.249
We must get the victim's detailed file
as soon as possible.

59:29.375 --> 59:31.290
The murderer will kill again. Soon.

59:31.666 --> 59:33.540
We have to find out his pattern
before that happens.

59:34.791 --> 59:35.624
What the hell!

59:36.125 --> 59:37.165
What's this Lao-wai (foreigner) doing?

59:37.166 --> 59:38.332
Act so charming...

59:38.458 --> 59:39.624
What do you want from her?

59:39.708 --> 59:41.124
You have competition now,

59:41.541 --> 59:42.540
a strong contender.

59:42.583 --> 59:43.332
Strong?

59:43.583 --> 59:44.832
I don't think so.

59:45.125 --> 59:45.790
Let's take a look

59:46.916 --> 59:48.124
at your rival.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.415
Why don't they go back to the police station?

59:51.833 --> 59:53.165
In the US, coroners don't get paid much,

59:53.208 --> 59:54.415
a lot of them are part time.

59:54.500 --> 59:56.165
There are less than 500
full time positions in the US,

59:56.166 --> 59:57.790
but every year 2.5 million people die.

01:00:11.083 --> 01:00:12.665
It's over, the entire hospital is his,

01:00:12.666 --> 01:00:13.582
brother Tang Ren...

01:00:13.583 --> 01:00:14.499
You...

01:00:15.625 --> 01:00:16.790
...Happy Year of the Dog.

01:00:20.166 --> 01:00:22.124
If he's so rich,
why is he still a forensic doctor?

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:23.332
Is it to get girls?

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.707
It's called giving back, get it?

01:00:24.916 --> 01:00:25.999
Volunteering, get it?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:26.707
Stop talking.

01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:28.082
We cannot do anything

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:29.582
dressed like this.

01:00:36.041 --> 01:00:37.540
We are in the women's changing room!

01:00:37.541 --> 01:00:38.540
All women products!

01:00:38.583 --> 01:00:39.374
Let's get changed!

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:26.457
Let's get it.

01:01:52.666 --> 01:01:54.207
Damn, he has a wife.

01:01:55.416 --> 01:01:56.957
I knew he was a douchebag.

01:02:02.666 --> 01:02:04.374
He even has a bed in his office?

01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:06.165
Why would you put a bed in here?

01:02:06.375 --> 01:02:08.332
What an animal!

01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:10.624
Found it!

01:02:12.208 --> 01:02:12.999
White male,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.790
lawyer,

01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:15.374
lost a liver,

01:02:16.208 --> 01:02:17.374
cut with the left hand in the same way.

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:34.915
Excuse me?

01:02:36.958 --> 01:02:38.124
Who are you?

01:02:40.041 --> 01:02:41.207
Cleaning staff.

01:02:41.666 --> 01:02:42.832
Cleaning staff?

01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:46.624
Can you leave? Are you done?

01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:47.915
Can you leave please?

01:02:48.583 --> 01:02:49.499
Yes.

01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:56.999
I like her stocking

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.374
Apparently I have cleaning staff.

01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:01.499
Apparently

01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:08.832
I'm sorry about your wife,

01:03:10.125 --> 01:03:11.582
she was so beautiful.

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:12.707
I miss her so much.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.957
When it's just the two of us
we can speak Chinese.

01:03:19.041 --> 01:03:20.207
James,

01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:21.790
I just wanted to say that...

01:03:22.125 --> 01:03:23.624
life goes on.

01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:29.832
It's not that easy.

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.374
I haven't been with another woman.

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:34.165
Since I lost her

01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:36.707
Actually...

01:03:37.416 --> 01:03:38.582
you could.

01:03:44.208 --> 01:03:45.374
Can I take a look?

01:03:45.666 --> 01:03:46.832
Of course.

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:50.207
Please. It's a bit messy

01:03:50.208 --> 01:03:51.957
hope you don't mind.

01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:04.165
What... kind of woman do you like?

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:06.040
Like you.

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.582
Slim, sophisticated like you.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.665
Really?

01:04:19.291 --> 01:04:20.874
You sure you like the slim kind?

01:04:21.375 --> 01:04:24.165
Yes. What's wrong?

01:04:24.833 --> 01:04:26.082
Am I interrupting?

01:04:29.208 --> 01:04:31.082
Laura, this is Desiree,

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:33.124
my lovely assistant.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:37.540
Hi Laura

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:42.957
Are you OK?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:44.832
Yeah.

01:04:45.291 --> 01:04:47.415
Sorry, it's me who's interrupting.

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:48.499
You are not interrupting.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.040
- Sorry
- What did I do?

01:04:50.041 --> 01:04:52.665
Laura! Are you OK?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.040
Let me walk you out.

01:05:00.208 --> 01:05:01.374
Stop!

01:05:03.708 --> 01:05:04.874
Where is Song Yi?

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:06.290
Where did you hide him?

01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:07.790
You got the wrong guy,

01:05:08.166 --> 01:05:09.040
he's not the murderer!

01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:10.457
He's not the killer.

01:05:10.458 --> 01:05:11.915
We saw the murderer last night.

01:05:11.958 --> 01:05:13.249
We did!

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:14.624
Why should I believe you?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.999
It was us who called the cops last night!

01:05:17.083 --> 01:05:19.249
The ship factory too!

01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:21.457
We wouldn't help him if he was the killer.

01:05:21.458 --> 01:05:22.999
I still want the 5 million!

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:23.707
Well,

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:25.374
even if he is not the killer,

01:05:25.416 --> 01:05:26.832
you need to come to the station
with me to clear this up.

01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:28.582
We can't.

01:05:28.916 --> 01:05:30.665
The killer's about to take his next victim.

01:05:31.041 --> 01:05:32.082
Give me some time,

01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:33.790
I'm about to crack his pattern.

01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:35.249
You really think you're a genius detective?

01:05:35.333 --> 01:05:37.040
Only three days left
till Uncle Seven's deadline.

01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:39.082
You think you'll beat the NYPD?

01:05:41.833 --> 01:05:42.624
I will try.

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:46.624
We will try.

01:05:56.583 --> 01:05:57.749
I'll pretend I didn't see you.

01:05:58.583 --> 01:05:59.749
If you lose,

01:05:59.916 --> 01:06:01.540
you go on a date with me!

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:03.665
OK.

01:06:03.958 --> 01:06:05.499
But what if you lose?

01:06:06.208 --> 01:06:07.665
I'll go on a date with you.

01:06:10.416 --> 01:06:11.374
Just once.

01:06:11.541 --> 01:06:12.874
I see you're not that dumb

01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:14.540
when it comes to girls.

01:06:14.583 --> 01:06:16.707
I'm great at everything!

01:06:17.291 --> 01:06:18.457
But where is 5 million?

01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:22.124
"Diagram of the Ultimateless"

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.665
Where is Song Yi?

01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:51.749
I'm not telling, even if you kill me.

01:06:51.875 --> 01:06:52.790
I'm not telling, even if you kill him.

01:06:52.791 --> 01:06:54.332
You wanna play tough?

01:06:57.458 --> 01:06:58.832
I really don't know,

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:00.749
we lost him at the hospital!

01:07:00.833 --> 01:07:01.582
Plus, he's not the killer,

01:07:01.583 --> 01:07:02.915
what's the point?

01:07:02.916 --> 01:07:04.332
I don't care if he's the killer or not!

01:07:04.916 --> 01:07:06.915
I've only three days left,

01:07:07.166 --> 01:07:08.374
if I don't bring him,

01:07:08.416 --> 01:07:10.499
I don't get a penny from the old man!

01:07:11.083 --> 01:07:12.249
Some love and kindness please?

01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:13.707
If

01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:14.999
I lure him in,

01:07:15.666 --> 01:07:17.290
what's my cut?

01:07:17.708 --> 01:07:18.874
Tang,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.165
you're shameless.

01:07:20.416 --> 01:07:21.957
Shut up, I'm your uncle.

01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:23.290
Cousin!

01:07:23.541 --> 01:07:24.624
I don't want an uncle like you.

01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:26.207
Stupid little stutterer. School-reject!

01:07:26.416 --> 01:07:28.415
Liar. Pervert. Old hoodrat!

01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:29.915
I'm gonna knock your teeth out...

01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:31.082
Bring it on!

01:07:35.458 --> 01:07:36.290
Little stutterer!

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:37.874
Pervert!

01:07:38.875 --> 01:07:40.540
Respect!

01:07:41.416 --> 01:07:42.624
Take them to the dungeon.

01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:45.040
- Flunker
- Old pervert!

01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:47.249
Bite me.

01:07:48.166 --> 01:07:49.540
Bite me.

01:07:49.541 --> 01:07:50.582
You little stutterer.

01:07:50.583 --> 01:07:51.749
You're a dead man!

01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:54.290
Die!

01:07:55.625 --> 01:07:57.207
Can you open the door?

01:07:57.333 --> 01:07:58.999
It opens from the outside,

01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:00.915
what can I do?

01:08:01.875 --> 01:08:03.040
You think we're in a movie?

01:08:03.291 --> 01:08:04.874
Things happen miraculously?

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:07.124
It's over.

01:08:07.666 --> 01:08:09.332
Just three days left,

01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:11.165
my 5 million dream is hopeless.

01:08:11.791 --> 01:08:12.957
Since we're stuck in here,

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:15.124
let's go over the case.

01:08:15.416 --> 01:08:16.624
This is what we have so far.

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:19.249
Based on the sevoflurane residues
found in the body,

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:20.499
the characteristics of the wound

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.082
and the symbol left at the crime scene,

01:08:22.082 --> 01:08:24.374
we're officially treating these
as related cases.

01:08:24.375 --> 01:08:26.332
Everyone, we're facing a serial killer!

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:29.874
Usually there's a clear pattern

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.540
in serial murders,

01:08:32.207 --> 01:08:33.332
but in this case,

01:08:33.957 --> 01:08:35.290
besides the symbol,

01:08:35.832 --> 01:08:37.082
there's nothing else.

01:08:38.875 --> 01:08:40.832
There's a three-day gap
between the first and second murder,

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:43.332
then a seven-day gap
between the second and third one.

01:08:43.625 --> 01:08:44.832
No hunting pattern

01:08:44.832 --> 01:08:45.999
in terms of time

01:08:46.666 --> 01:08:48.290
or location.

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:50.957
There's also usually some sort of criteria
in choosing a victim:

01:08:51.416 --> 01:08:52.749
young women, for example,

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.290
or a specific occupation.

01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:55.915
But again,

01:08:56.916 --> 01:08:58.457
no victim pattern either.

01:08:59.291 --> 01:09:01.040
Maybe he's just randomly killing people

01:09:01.082 --> 01:09:02.499
we're overthinking?

01:09:04.291 --> 01:09:05.582
He's been careful not to leave evidence,

01:09:05.582 --> 01:09:07.207
methodical even.

01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:08.915
It cannot be random killing,

01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:11.082
we just haven't found the connection yet.

01:09:11.125 --> 01:09:13.374
Only if we find it,
can we know the killer's next prey,

01:09:13.791 --> 01:09:15.332
even the location.

01:09:15.457 --> 01:09:16.415
If we can't

01:09:16.416 --> 01:09:18.207
those Americans can't either.

01:09:18.375 --> 01:09:19.124
No.

01:09:19.875 --> 01:09:21.082
Not unless they use...

01:09:21.832 --> 01:09:23.415
Locard's Exchange Principle!

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:25.082
Time is running, I suggest

01:09:25.082 --> 01:09:26.874
we use all our Lab Resources across the city

01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:28.165
to cross examine again

01:09:28.166 --> 01:09:30.040
all of the physical evidence
the three crime scenes.

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:31.665
This is our only chance

01:09:31.666 --> 01:09:33.332
to anticipate the killer's next move.

01:09:34.332 --> 01:09:35.999
I'm sure you don't want a fourth victim,

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:36.874
right?

01:09:38.832 --> 01:09:41.082
What did the girl hacker send you?

01:09:41.375 --> 01:09:42.124
A photo...

01:09:42.625 --> 01:09:43.624
Lu Guofu's goon took it

01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:45.124
before I had a chance to check.

01:09:45.625 --> 01:09:46.790
A nude pic?

01:09:47.332 --> 01:09:49.040
A photo about the Yin Yang Wu Xing!

01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:50.790
Ah!

01:09:51.082 --> 01:09:52.957
Who says there's no connection
among the victims?

01:09:53.082 --> 01:09:54.707
Of course there is.

01:09:55.083 --> 01:09:56.707
What connection?

01:09:56.833 --> 01:09:58.207
They're all dead!

01:09:59.708 --> 01:10:00.832
No, no.

01:10:01.041 --> 01:10:03.124
Take me through each case again.

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:04.540
The cases...

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:05.707
Ok,

01:10:06.333 --> 01:10:07.415
listen.

01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:09.957
The first case -

01:10:10.375 --> 01:10:11.290
Chinatown

01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:12.790
Zao Wang Temple.

01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.665
The victim is Uncle Seven's grandson, Jason,

01:10:15.666 --> 01:10:16.457
Chinese

01:10:16.458 --> 01:10:17.290
male.

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:19.374
The killer took his heart.

01:10:20.333 --> 01:10:21.374
Time of death?

01:10:21.666 --> 01:10:23.749
July 1 st, between 9-10 AM.

01:10:25.125 --> 01:10:26.374
Of course! Zao Wang,

01:10:26.416 --> 01:10:28.999
the Kitchen God, is related to Fire.

01:10:29.208 --> 01:10:29.874
The heart organ

01:10:29.875 --> 01:10:32.332
belongs to the Fire Element.

01:10:32.333 --> 01:10:33.957
And in Chinese Astrology, this date and time,

01:10:34.041 --> 01:10:35.790
July 1 st from 9-10 AM,

01:10:35.791 --> 01:10:37.082
is a Fire hour.

01:10:37.416 --> 01:10:38.832
Can't be a coincidence, can it?

01:10:39.833 --> 01:10:40.790
Next one!

01:10:42.208 --> 01:10:44.832
Second case, East River -

01:10:45.125 --> 01:10:46.124
I know this one.

01:10:46.125 --> 01:10:47.665
The victim is a white female!

01:10:47.666 --> 01:10:49.249
Correct. Saleswoman,

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.082
killer took her kidney.

01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:53.665
Judging from the geography along the river

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.415
the location belongs to water

01:10:55.541 --> 01:10:56.540
in the Five Elements.

01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:58.040
So does the kidney organ.

01:10:58.041 --> 01:10:58.874
Water Element.

01:10:58.875 --> 01:11:00.790
Time of death is June 27th,

01:11:01.166 --> 01:11:02.457
between 11 PM - 1AM.

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:05.332
Water date, water hour!

01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:10.749
The third case happened at 3AM this morning.

01:11:11.125 --> 01:11:12.999
July 7th - wood date,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.999
3AM - wood hour,

01:11:15.416 --> 01:11:17.040
park and liver,

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:18.915
no doubt are both wood!

01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:21.249
You're a human camera,

01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:22.040
you must still remember

01:11:22.041 --> 01:11:23.790
the three victims'
"Eight Characters of Birth Time".

01:11:28.125 --> 01:11:30.457
There're dates of birth, no time.

01:11:30.708 --> 01:11:31.957
The East River victim:

01:11:31.958 --> 01:11:33.999
December 5th, 1982, at 11 pm

01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:37.624
Zao Wang Temple victim:
May 22nd, 1986, 11 am

01:11:38.041 --> 01:11:41.999
Washington Park victim:
February 27th, 1974, 6am

01:11:43.416 --> 01:11:44.582
Of course,

01:11:44.583 --> 01:11:46.374
the three victim's fortunes are

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:47.249
water, fire and wood respectively.

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:48.165
It's clear now

01:11:48.166 --> 01:11:51.082
the killer chose the time, the location,
the victims and the organs

01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:53.332
all according to the Five Elements Theory.

01:11:53.583 --> 01:11:55.457
Tang, you're something else.

01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:57.082
But why did he do it?

01:12:55.583 --> 01:12:56.999
What did you see this time?

01:12:58.083 --> 01:12:59.165
I see.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.624
The killer's using New York City as his altar.

01:13:01.958 --> 01:13:04.457
Five elements, five victims,

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:05.707
five organs to practice alchemy.

01:13:06.625 --> 01:13:07.582
He... wants to...

01:13:08.333 --> 01:13:09.832
become immortal!

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:33.499
Tang,

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:34.624
can you tell me

01:13:34.625 --> 01:13:36.124
what's the nearest Metal date?

01:13:38.375 --> 01:13:39.957
So soon! It's today.

01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:40.749
Today?

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:42.665
What about the hour?

01:13:42.666 --> 01:13:44.290
Metal,

01:13:44.541 --> 01:13:46.665
Between 3pm to 7PM!

01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:49.832
We have less than 10 hours,

01:13:50.166 --> 01:13:51.457
we need to get out of here.

01:13:51.458 --> 01:13:53.707
You know the time, but do you know where?

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:57.082
Let me find out.

01:14:25.041 --> 01:14:26.124
Found it?

01:14:27.541 --> 01:14:28.582
No.

01:14:28.583 --> 01:14:30.249
I don't remember the map's every detail

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:32.040
and cannot put together a lot of the buildings.

01:14:32.791 --> 01:14:34.457
If I had a digital map I could do it,

01:14:35.833 --> 01:14:37.207
but those goons took our phones.

01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:38.540
Somebody,

01:14:38.666 --> 01:14:39.624
anybody!

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:40.624
Hey!

01:14:40.625 --> 01:14:41.707
Hey!

01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:42.540
Open the door!

01:14:42.541 --> 01:14:43.665
Someone open the door,

01:14:43.666 --> 01:14:44.790
please!

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.749
Tell your boss

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:50.165
we know who the killer is!

01:14:50.166 --> 01:14:52.207
Let us out and we'll find him!

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:54.540
Do we look stupid to you?

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.457
It's already 1:40PM,

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:06.165
there's only one hour left
before he kills again.

01:15:09.333 --> 01:15:10.165
Open the door.

01:15:10.875 --> 01:15:12.332
Open the door!

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.749
- Someone
- Come!

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:14.582
Let us out of here!

01:15:14.708 --> 01:15:15.999
There are two days left,

01:15:16.041 --> 01:15:17.332
don't you want to solve the case?

01:15:17.666 --> 01:15:19.457
Go to your boss again,

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.874
we really do know the killer's next move.

01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:22.374
One more person will die

01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:24.082
if we don't act and
your Uncle Seven's revenge will never happen.

01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:25.374
What are you trying now?

01:15:26.291 --> 01:15:27.415
You want our empathy?

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:29.749
We

01:15:30.083 --> 01:15:31.540
won't fall for that.

01:15:40.125 --> 01:15:42.165
Old Chin, I don't think we'll make it.

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:43.207
But it's alright

01:15:43.208 --> 01:15:44.332
he still needs to kill one more person

01:15:44.333 --> 01:15:45.999
We still have a chance.

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:48.249
But we're talking about someone's life here!

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:50.124
But we're stuck here. What can we do?

01:15:51.958 --> 01:15:53.165
Don't you know some ancient prayers?

01:15:53.166 --> 01:15:55.040
Try them!

01:15:58.375 --> 01:15:59.540
Fine!

01:16:05.041 --> 01:16:06.249
...Master

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.457
of the Dipper

01:16:07.458 --> 01:16:08.582
and North star...

01:16:09.291 --> 01:16:10.499
In the name of...

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:11.874
the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord...

01:16:11.875 --> 01:16:13.249
And...

01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:14.124
Open!

01:16:18.458 --> 01:16:19.874
Thank you,

01:16:20.166 --> 01:16:22.249
Grand Supreme Elderly Lord!

01:16:22.333 --> 01:16:24.040
You should thank the Mother Queen.

01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:34.207
What's going on?

01:16:34.458 --> 01:16:35.915
I hacked into their lunch delivery

01:16:35.916 --> 01:16:37.707
and slipped some "special seasonings"
into their food.

01:16:38.166 --> 01:16:39.790
Why didn't you hack their breakfast?

01:16:40.166 --> 01:16:41.832
You should be grateful I'm here at all.

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.874
Who knows why they had lunch so late?

01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:45.415
Are you in a rush?

01:16:45.541 --> 01:16:47.290
In a rush to save a life!

01:16:52.958 --> 01:16:54.082
What kind of black technology is this?

01:16:54.458 --> 01:16:55.249
Awesome battery life.

01:16:58.583 --> 01:16:59.499
Hello.

01:16:59.708 --> 01:17:00.457
Yes.

01:17:02.791 --> 01:17:05.457
After cross examining,
eliminating and filtering evidence

01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:06.832
in collaboration with the other labs,

01:17:06.833 --> 01:17:08.207
we discovered a material that

01:17:08.208 --> 01:17:10.290
does not belong to any of the crime scenes.

01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:11.499
What is it?

01:17:11.541 --> 01:17:12.290
Sugar.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.332
Kiko

01:17:13.458 --> 01:17:14.290
you know what this is?

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:17.749
Wande,

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:18.707
an abandoned sugar refinery.

01:17:20.208 --> 01:17:21.999
Wait... who told you we were there?

01:17:22.458 --> 01:17:24.165
WeChat, right?

01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:26.665
When you added me,

01:17:26.666 --> 01:17:28.165
you started tracking me through GPS.

01:17:28.791 --> 01:17:29.790
So... you?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.624
She never quit the game,

01:17:32.666 --> 01:17:34.124
she's just been waiting
for us to solve the case

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:35.832
and catch the killer herself

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.749
ahead of everyone.

01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:40.290
When Noda Hiroshi left,

01:17:40.291 --> 01:17:41.749
you guys were my only option

01:17:44.833 --> 01:17:46.124
So sneaky!

01:17:47.916 --> 01:17:48.999
The fact is

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:51.207
you didn't disappoint me.

01:17:53.666 --> 01:17:54.499
What?

01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:55.749
He didn't disappoint you

01:17:56.541 --> 01:17:57.957
because I cracked the case!

01:17:58.666 --> 01:18:00.749
Old Chin, tell her it was me.

01:18:02.916 --> 01:18:04.124
Look... "Q" just posted on Crimaster.

01:18:04.125 --> 01:18:04.915
What is he saying?

01:18:05.583 --> 01:18:07.540
He says whoever wants the 5 million

01:18:08.166 --> 01:18:09.582
should go to the Wande sugar refinery now.

01:18:09.666 --> 01:18:10.582
That's where the killer will strike next.

01:18:12.708 --> 01:18:14.040
Thank God we're almost there!

01:18:14.416 --> 01:18:15.665
Damn this Preserved Egg

01:18:15.666 --> 01:18:17.582
what's in it for him?

01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:32.415
5 million?

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.124
Where you been?

01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:36.457
I was nearby when I saw "Q" 's post.

01:18:38.208 --> 01:18:40.165
It's time. Everyone, be careful.

01:18:48.416 --> 01:18:49.374
Let's split into two groups

01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:50.457
call if you find anything.

01:18:53.458 --> 01:18:54.332
Turn it off!

01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:56.082
We'll be exposed.

01:19:07.333 --> 01:19:08.290
Remember,

01:19:08.666 --> 01:19:09.749
do not

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:11.749
attack the cops.

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:11.540
Police!

01:20:14.875 --> 01:20:16.415
I'm gonna kill you.

01:20:16.958 --> 01:20:18.165
Pervert!

01:20:19.958 --> 01:20:20.874
Song.

01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:26.040
It's dark as hell.

01:20:26.416 --> 01:20:27.957
How am I gonna catch 5 million?

01:20:28.125 --> 01:20:30.165
You never know.

01:20:30.375 --> 01:20:32.332
Fortune favors the brave.

01:20:48.666 --> 01:20:49.749
Are you stupid?

01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:50.582
Why did you turn on the light?

01:20:50.583 --> 01:20:51.915
What if Song Yi escapes?

01:20:58.333 --> 01:20:59.749
Nobody moves.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.540
This is a crime scene...

01:21:01.541 --> 01:21:03.832
Daddy, hit me!

01:21:07.791 --> 01:21:08.832
You are stupid.

01:21:09.458 --> 01:21:10.457
You think you are the boss now?

01:21:10.958 --> 01:21:12.124
I'll turn it on if I want to!

01:21:12.416 --> 01:21:13.457
Yes, I am your boss.

01:21:17.958 --> 01:21:20.290
Damn it. I am the boss.

01:21:21.291 --> 01:21:22.415
I am.

01:21:24.125 --> 01:21:24.999
I am.

01:21:47.291 --> 01:21:48.874
Stop playing with the lights.

01:21:48.958 --> 01:21:50.540
What is this, a dance club?

01:21:50.583 --> 01:21:52.249
Arrest them all.

01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:55.165
We're detectives,

01:21:55.166 --> 01:21:56.374
not criminals.

01:21:56.375 --> 01:21:57.582
Yeah!

01:21:57.583 --> 01:22:00.332
You just assaulted a police officer, asshole.

01:22:00.375 --> 01:22:01.624
Everyone to the station.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:02.457
Everyone!

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:03.999
Including the little one.

01:22:04.291 --> 01:22:06.582
Cordon this place up and call Forensics.

01:22:07.583 --> 01:22:08.999
And let these guys go.

01:22:13.333 --> 01:22:14.749
Why are you letting them go?

01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:16.790
Don't you get it?
They're Uncle Seven's people.

01:22:17.083 --> 01:22:18.707
The mayor needs the Chinatown vote.

01:22:19.041 --> 01:22:20.999
The Chinese are useful when it comes to voting

01:22:21.208 --> 01:22:22.749
cause they're so many.

01:22:31.416 --> 01:22:33.749
Why lock us up with the killer?

01:22:36.583 --> 01:22:38.040
- He... he
- Allow me.

01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:40.207
He's not the killer.

01:22:40.208 --> 01:22:41.874
The three of them saw the real murderer.

01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:43.540
So... we won't get the money?

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:44.457
You still can

01:22:44.458 --> 01:22:47.249
but you need to catch the real killer.

01:22:47.291 --> 01:22:49.249
But tomorrow is the last day.

01:22:49.416 --> 01:22:50.582
It's impossible.

01:22:50.583 --> 01:22:51.749
If it weren't for you people,

01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:53.124
I would have gotten the money already.

01:22:56.791 --> 01:22:58.124
Is Lu Guofu missing a lung?

01:22:58.666 --> 01:22:59.832
What else do you know?

01:23:00.083 --> 01:23:01.665
The killer is using New York City as his altar,

01:23:01.666 --> 01:23:02.749
choosing his victims
according to the Five Elements.

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:04.207
The next one is Earth.

01:23:04.208 --> 01:23:05.874
He'll kill in Midtown Manhattan.

01:23:05.875 --> 01:23:07.040
Today's Earth Element hours
show some variables.

01:23:07.041 --> 01:23:09.415
7-9AM,

01:23:09.416 --> 01:23:13.082
1-3PM or 7-9PM are all possible!

01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:14.999
This is his last victim.

01:23:15.208 --> 01:23:16.374
If we don't catch him now

01:23:16.375 --> 01:23:17.832
we might miss our chance.

01:23:17.875 --> 01:23:18.957
I understand,

01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:20.999
Detectives.

01:23:21.625 --> 01:23:23.624
But midtown is very big.

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:25.290
Where do we start?

01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:27.749
I'll get the autopsy report.

01:23:28.541 --> 01:23:30.874
You guys focus on saving Song Yi.

01:23:31.458 --> 01:23:32.915
Your testimonies are

01:23:33.291 --> 01:23:34.874
not enough to acquit him.

01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:43.040
We can't quit now.

01:23:43.291 --> 01:23:44.832
What can we do?

01:23:44.916 --> 01:23:47.249
I feel like I'm missing something.

01:23:48.375 --> 01:23:49.582
It's hard

01:23:49.833 --> 01:23:51.790
Who'd have thought

01:23:52.083 --> 01:23:54.124
Lu Goufu would be the fourth victim?

01:23:57.916 --> 01:24:00.540
Tang, you are amazing!

01:24:00.541 --> 01:24:01.582
What?

01:24:01.916 --> 01:24:02.874
You just said that you couldn't have guessed

01:24:02.875 --> 01:24:04.040
the fourth victim would be Lu Guofu, right?

01:24:04.166 --> 01:24:06.207
- Yes?
- But how did the killer know?

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:07.082
What do you mean?

01:24:07.708 --> 01:24:08.457
I mean,

01:24:09.083 --> 01:24:10.249
you managed to calculate their elements

01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:11.957
which are water, fire, wood,

01:24:12.458 --> 01:24:13.665
but they have no relation,

01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:16.082
then how did the killer know them?

01:24:16.875 --> 01:24:18.249
- Right.
- Unless...

01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:20.624
The killer had access to their information.

01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:21.999
Say, he works in insurance,

01:24:22.333 --> 01:24:24.249
or a bank... or a police station.

01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:27.207
We need to compare data.

01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:29.540
But we don't have a computer!

01:24:30.208 --> 01:24:32.332
Don't insult me.

01:24:33.416 --> 01:24:34.749
How can a hacker

01:24:35.666 --> 01:24:36.457
not have a computer?

01:24:52.791 --> 01:24:55.249
Won't you go blind staring
at such a tiny screen?

01:24:55.291 --> 01:24:57.499
Do you ring?

01:24:58.375 --> 01:24:59.207
What do you mean?

01:24:59.208 --> 01:25:00.124
Cuz you're dumb as a doorbell.

01:25:00.833 --> 01:25:02.749
How dare you!

01:25:12.125 --> 01:25:14.124
Hi, looking for James?

01:25:14.416 --> 01:25:15.165
Yes...

01:25:15.708 --> 01:25:17.499
He should be in the autopsy lab.

01:25:17.541 --> 01:25:19.332
Want me to call him?

01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:23.207
I'll go myself.

01:25:23.541 --> 01:25:25.124
Thank you.

01:25:26.333 --> 01:25:27.874
Bank, insurance company, shopping malls...

01:25:27.875 --> 01:25:28.957
The victims' data doesn't match anywhere.

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:30.832
Unless it's police station.

01:25:31.291 --> 01:25:32.124
Chin Fong.

01:25:33.416 --> 01:25:34.499
Chin Fong.

01:25:57.625 --> 01:25:58.624
There is another possibility.

01:26:00.625 --> 01:26:01.332
Hospital.

01:26:01.333 --> 01:26:02.749
Check if the victims

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:04.415
have been to the same hospital.

01:26:04.625 --> 01:26:05.374
Got it.

01:26:07.375 --> 01:26:08.290
What did you remember?

01:26:09.541 --> 01:26:10.582
I hope I'm wrong.

01:26:23.125 --> 01:26:24.665
I'm here to get the autopsy report.

01:26:26.458 --> 01:26:27.499
Am I interrupting you?

01:26:29.666 --> 01:26:30.707
Oh, it's not done yet.

01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:33.290
You look pale...

01:26:34.666 --> 01:26:36.540
I didn't sleep well last night.

01:26:37.083 --> 01:26:38.832
So this is this the fourth victim?

01:26:39.041 --> 01:26:39.624
Yes.

01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:41.290
Is there a problem?

01:26:44.958 --> 01:26:45.832
I'm just wondering

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:47.374
why a Chinese man would...

01:26:49.666 --> 01:26:50.707
Would you like some coffee?

01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:52.915
Sure.

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:53.665
Good

01:26:55.083 --> 01:26:56.040
I'll be right back.

01:27:02.375 --> 01:27:03.707
What are you thinking exactly?

01:27:04.583 --> 01:27:05.957
Sherlock Holmes once said

01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:07.624
there is no perfect crime.

01:27:08.333 --> 01:27:09.790
The truth has always been in front of us,

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:11.165
just buried under all the noise.

01:27:11.416 --> 01:27:12.207
Our work as detectives

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:14.207
is to filter it out,
leaving only the essential details.

01:27:15.708 --> 01:27:16.499
And so?

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.165
We've been so focused on the Chinese rituals...

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:21.082
but who says the killer has to be Chinese?

01:27:22.083 --> 01:27:23.749
I recalled what we know so far

01:27:24.166 --> 01:27:25.999
and found there are some details I neglected.

01:27:26.833 --> 01:27:28.332
The killer had a surgical knife.

01:27:29.416 --> 01:27:31.499
His wife is Chinese and he knows the language.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.082
The cancer treatment pills.

01:27:33.625 --> 01:27:34.707
The mug's position

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:35.749
showing he's left handed.

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.207
More importantly,

01:27:37.625 --> 01:27:39.415
I just remembered his wife's name

01:27:39.916 --> 01:27:41.124
was on the library's check-out sheet.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.374
I see!

01:27:42.458 --> 01:27:44.665
You mean his wife's the killer?

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:46.332
I got the data,

01:27:49.125 --> 01:27:50.832
they all have been to the same hospital.

01:27:51.125 --> 01:27:52.457
The name is...

01:28:29.333 --> 01:28:30.457
Please call the chief,

01:28:30.458 --> 01:28:31.540
we know who the killer is.

01:28:31.541 --> 01:28:32.915
You have to believe us.

01:28:32.958 --> 01:28:34.332
I also know who the killer is.

01:28:35.708 --> 01:28:37.082
It's one of you.

01:28:37.458 --> 01:28:38.332
Damn it.

01:28:39.541 --> 01:28:40.374
What do we do now?

01:28:40.625 --> 01:28:41.999
They'll never believe us!

01:28:42.208 --> 01:28:43.374
Call Ying,

01:28:43.375 --> 01:28:44.749
she'll believe us.

01:28:44.958 --> 01:28:46.457
She just said that
she was going to get the autopsy report.

01:28:46.708 --> 01:28:47.624
Officer Chen...

01:28:48.250 --> 01:28:48.999
What's her element?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.665
I've compared our birth dates

01:28:50.666 --> 01:28:51.749
and we are perfect match.

01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:54.374
I'm Metal and she is Earth.

01:28:57.625 --> 01:28:59.499
James's hospital is in Midtown Manhattan,

01:28:59.750 --> 01:29:01.707
and his last name has
the word Field in it. As in Earth.

01:29:03.083 --> 01:29:04.457
The hospital is his last altar

01:29:04.458 --> 01:29:06.707
and Chen Ying his last offering.

01:29:16.458 --> 01:29:17.665
Did you get through?

01:29:17.666 --> 01:29:18.499
Yes,

01:29:18.875 --> 01:29:19.957
but she's not picking up!

01:29:20.625 --> 01:29:22.540
Oh no! Something must have happened.

01:29:22.875 --> 01:29:23.707
Don't panic.

01:29:23.916 --> 01:29:25.124
Officer Chen left here around 2PM,

01:29:25.833 --> 01:29:26.707
the killer is waiting
for an Earth time to do it

01:29:26.708 --> 01:29:27.874
which is 7-9PM.

01:29:28.333 --> 01:29:29.124
We still have time.

01:29:29.125 --> 01:29:30.124
We don't!

01:29:30.208 --> 01:29:31.540
We can't even get out of here!

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:32.915
Tang Ren is right.

01:29:32.916 --> 01:29:33.957
We can't rely on anyone

01:29:33.958 --> 01:29:35.165
but ourselves now.

01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:36.040
To save her,

01:29:36.041 --> 01:29:37.332
we need to get out of here.

01:29:37.708 --> 01:29:38.915
And how we're gonna do that?

01:29:38.916 --> 01:29:40.290
This is the NYPD.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:41.499
Maybe

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.207
it's time we all work together.

01:29:57.708 --> 01:29:59.832
You all say you're great detectives,

01:30:00.166 --> 01:30:02.707
Why do I feel like you're a bunch of frauds?

01:30:02.833 --> 01:30:03.999
You're the fraud!

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.040
Which one do you mean?

01:30:05.041 --> 01:30:07.374
I can crush you in a second. Wanna try?

01:30:07.375 --> 01:30:08.707
When I solved my first case

01:30:08.708 --> 01:30:11.124
you were still swimming in your daddy's balls.

01:30:11.958 --> 01:30:12.957
Alright,

01:30:12.958 --> 01:30:13.874
big shots.

01:30:14.125 --> 01:30:16.124
Look. We already found the murderer

01:30:16.125 --> 01:30:18.707
and the time and place of his next move.

01:30:19.291 --> 01:30:20.415
Will you help us?

01:30:20.625 --> 01:30:22.082
How do we help you?

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:23.665
Prison break?

01:30:23.916 --> 01:30:24.915
Precisely.

01:30:25.541 --> 01:30:26.999
Prison break.

01:30:29.666 --> 01:30:32.290
I hope you can help them get out.

01:30:34.791 --> 01:30:38.374
Because this is not
just a matter of saving a life,

01:30:38.791 --> 01:30:39.874
but more importantly...

01:30:39.875 --> 01:30:40.999
What?

01:30:41.041 --> 01:30:42.957
We call ourselves detectives,

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:46.832
but if we can't work together
to solve this case,

01:30:47.541 --> 01:30:48.999
what does that say about us?

01:30:52.791 --> 01:30:54.665
Wouldn't that be a shame?

01:31:01.708 --> 01:31:04.582
What the...?! Why would you do that?

01:31:06.083 --> 01:31:08.040
Hey, what are you doing?!

01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:24.707
Don't just stand there.

01:31:24.708 --> 01:31:25.374
Go!

01:31:39.083 --> 01:31:41.332
Chinese Kung Fu!

01:31:41.666 --> 01:31:42.332
Go!

01:32:36.291 --> 01:32:37.749
5 million!

01:32:38.250 --> 01:32:38.957
Catch them!

01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:59.499
Here!

01:33:00.416 --> 01:33:01.874
Here!

01:33:31.041 --> 01:33:31.957
Master!

01:33:31.958 --> 01:33:33.040
Tang Ren,

01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:34.499
You're in trouble?

01:33:35.083 --> 01:33:36.624
Help me, Master!

01:33:37.333 --> 01:33:38.790
In Chinatown

01:33:38.791 --> 01:33:41.457
as long as you're my student,

01:33:41.583 --> 01:33:42.624
who can dare to...

01:33:43.541 --> 01:33:44.665
I... AM... MO YOU-CHIAN!

01:33:44.666 --> 01:33:46.040
- I don't care who you are.
- I am...

01:33:46.125 --> 01:33:47.165
- You are?
- I...

01:33:47.166 --> 01:33:48.707
- You?
- MO YOU-CHIAN!

01:33:49.583 --> 01:33:50.332
Stop!

01:33:52.166 --> 01:33:53.290
Stop my ass.

01:34:06.166 --> 01:34:07.207
When the tiger is gentle,

01:34:07.208 --> 01:34:08.749
some people think it's Hello Kitty.

01:34:09.875 --> 01:34:11.582
Master, you are the best.

01:34:36.916 --> 01:34:39.249
Child, the car is over there.

01:34:39.291 --> 01:34:41.124
Master can only help you until here.

01:34:41.166 --> 01:34:42.082
Outside of Chinatown you're on your own.

01:34:42.083 --> 01:34:43.540
- Thank you, master.
- ...WAIT!

01:34:46.708 --> 01:34:48.999
This girl is so pretty.

01:34:49.125 --> 01:34:50.082
What's your name?

01:34:50.083 --> 01:34:51.582
Master, he's my partner,

01:34:51.583 --> 01:34:52.540
he can't be your wife.

01:34:52.583 --> 01:34:53.415
See ya!

01:34:53.416 --> 01:34:54.665
Let's go!

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.874
Shen Zhou Car Rental, at your service.

01:34:57.875 --> 01:34:58.707
No time

01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:59.707
for product placement!

01:35:04.083 --> 01:35:04.915
Shen Zhou

01:35:04.958 --> 01:35:05.915
reminds you to drive safe!

01:35:06.416 --> 01:35:08.249
Remember to give me a 5 star rating!

01:35:22.791 --> 01:35:23.415
What time is it?

01:35:24.375 --> 01:35:25.415
6:20PM.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.165
It's OK to lead the police to the hospital,

01:35:28.166 --> 01:35:29.624
just make sure they don't catch us.

01:35:29.625 --> 01:35:30.999
Got it! I'm the best driver.

01:36:30.625 --> 01:36:31.415
Get in, fast!

01:36:32.625 --> 01:36:33.582
Come on!

01:36:33.583 --> 01:36:34.457
Faster!

01:36:43.083 --> 01:36:44.540
We are surrounded!

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.665
This is what I call an action movie!

01:36:50.083 --> 01:36:51.290
Look! Look over there!

01:36:52.041 --> 01:36:52.957
Tencent Live!

01:36:53.458 --> 01:36:54.999
It's hard not to be famous now!

01:37:34.916 --> 01:37:35.832
Shoot!

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:46.790
Thank you, thank you.

01:39:02.041 --> 01:39:03.082
Let's go.

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:22.249
It's a big place, where do we start?

01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:26.957
Will the compass work?

01:39:26.958 --> 01:39:27.707
Shut up!

01:39:27.708 --> 01:39:28.999
This rod knows everything.

01:39:29.166 --> 01:39:30.915
The rod and I are one, united by the Gods.

01:39:32.083 --> 01:39:32.790
GO!

01:39:34.833 --> 01:39:35.499
It's here.

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:44.332
Here.

01:40:30.083 --> 01:40:30.874
It's not here, hurry up!

01:40:30.875 --> 01:40:31.665
Time's running out.

01:40:32.416 --> 01:40:33.290
Wait!

01:40:39.625 --> 01:40:40.332
What are you doing?

01:41:49.083 --> 01:41:49.832
Are you OK?

01:41:51.625 --> 01:41:52.374
Are you OK?

01:41:56.208 --> 01:41:57.040
Stop that.

01:41:57.958 --> 01:41:58.707
Officer Chen is all right,

01:41:59.083 --> 01:42:00.332
it's the sevoruflane.

01:42:01.125 --> 01:42:01.999
But where's the killer?

01:42:24.208 --> 01:42:24.957
Old Chin.

01:42:49.291 --> 01:42:50.040
Old Chin!

01:43:03.541 --> 01:43:04.332
Come out.

01:43:05.041 --> 01:43:06.082
Come out!

01:43:08.416 --> 01:43:09.165
Thank you.

01:43:11.416 --> 01:43:12.082
Of course.

01:43:12.083 --> 01:43:12.790
Come out.

01:43:14.125 --> 01:43:15.457
Bring your ass here, will ya?

01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:18.624
This is your last chance,

01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:20.457
or I'll ruin your precious ritual.

01:43:22.166 --> 01:43:23.415
Want to become immortal?

01:43:23.958 --> 01:43:25.165
In your dreams!

01:43:26.166 --> 01:43:26.915
Come out!

01:43:36.625 --> 01:43:37.374
You have cancer?

01:43:38.333 --> 01:43:39.832
That's why you're doing this?

01:43:42.833 --> 01:43:44.290
I used to believe God

01:43:44.875 --> 01:43:47.582
but he failed me, took away my beloved wife.

01:43:47.833 --> 01:43:49.457
I turned to science,

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:52.499
Again it failed me.

01:43:52.875 --> 01:43:54.749
And threatened my own life!

01:43:55.541 --> 01:43:57.165
I have one choice

01:43:58.791 --> 01:44:00.249
and that is...

01:44:00.833 --> 01:44:01.707
TAO.

01:44:02.541 --> 01:44:04.207
The Five Organs Alchemy Ritual is a fraud.

01:44:04.291 --> 01:44:05.582
Created by evil cults.

01:44:05.583 --> 01:44:06.707
There is no "TAO" in it at all

01:44:06.708 --> 01:44:08.957
The Tao produced One.

01:44:09.208 --> 01:44:10.790
One produced Two.

01:44:10.916 --> 01:44:12.915
Two produced Three.

01:44:13.541 --> 01:44:15.832
Three produced all things.

01:44:16.125 --> 01:44:18.374
We all are part human,

01:44:18.375 --> 01:44:19.790
part beast

01:44:20.583 --> 01:44:22.582
part divinity.

01:44:24.291 --> 01:44:26.040
Do you know who I am?

01:44:26.541 --> 01:44:29.124
Do you know how many lives I've saved?

01:44:29.125 --> 01:44:30.540
Hundreds!

01:44:30.541 --> 01:44:32.124
Thousands of lives!

01:44:32.125 --> 01:44:33.582
Like a God!

01:44:34.791 --> 01:44:36.374
I am

01:44:36.375 --> 01:44:37.540
God!

01:44:40.458 --> 01:44:45.415
Why can't I sacrifice a few mortal lives

01:44:45.833 --> 01:44:50.874
in exchange for one immortal life

01:44:53.166 --> 01:44:55.874
and keep saving lives.

01:44:58.041 --> 01:45:00.832
Isn't that how it should be?

01:45:01.625 --> 01:45:04.915
Isn't that how it should be?

01:45:05.166 --> 01:45:06.249
You are not god,

01:45:06.250 --> 01:45:07.624
you're crazy!

01:45:08.166 --> 01:45:09.915
You got the alchemy positions all wrong.

01:45:10.666 --> 01:45:12.165
Have you seen the 86's version
of "Journey to the West"?

01:45:12.666 --> 01:45:14.082
The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's alchemy pots

01:45:14.083 --> 01:45:16.124
are lined up in a row.

01:45:18.250 --> 01:45:19.749
The road is between yin and yang,

01:45:20.791 --> 01:45:22.040
you save lives during the day,

01:45:22.333 --> 01:45:23.249
and slaughter at night.

01:45:24.125 --> 01:45:25.332
Whether it is a god who saves,

01:45:25.333 --> 01:45:26.624
or a beast who kills,

01:45:27.541 --> 01:45:29.499
both are two extremes.

01:45:30.833 --> 01:45:31.915
Only the center is where

01:45:32.708 --> 01:45:34.457
all things carry Yin and embrace Yang,

01:45:34.583 --> 01:45:36.290
and by breathing together,
they live in harmony... meaning, humanity.

01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:39.082
You misinterpreted Tao,

01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:40.749
trying to be god

01:45:40.875 --> 01:45:41.832
or be a beast,

01:45:43.416 --> 01:45:44.624
you forgot how to be a human.

01:45:46.208 --> 01:45:48.124
He is neither god

01:45:48.125 --> 01:45:49.082
nor beast in my eyes,

01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:50.915
he's 5 million!

01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:53.499
Fuck it!

01:46:01.416 --> 01:46:02.165
Okay,

01:46:02.166 --> 01:46:03.082
understood.

01:46:06.041 --> 01:46:06.832
Bye.

01:46:11.625 --> 01:46:12.707
I have good news

01:46:13.166 --> 01:46:14.165
and bad news,

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:15.957
which one do you want to hear first?

01:46:16.375 --> 01:46:17.582
Let's go with the good one.

01:46:18.625 --> 01:46:20.124
No, the bad one first.

01:46:21.458 --> 01:46:23.499
Uncle Seven died an hour ago,

01:46:24.291 --> 01:46:25.874
your 5 million are gone.

01:46:27.166 --> 01:46:28.582
What? What is the good news then?

01:46:29.083 --> 01:46:30.332
The good news is that

01:46:30.333 --> 01:46:32.290
all the assets under his name

01:46:32.291 --> 01:46:33.999
are transferred to the church!

01:46:35.583 --> 01:46:37.040
Aren't those all bad news?

01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:39.499
Tang Ren,

01:46:40.416 --> 01:46:41.332
thank you!

01:46:41.583 --> 01:46:42.915
I am at your service.

01:46:56.416 --> 01:46:57.540
Hey, where is 5 million?

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:58.832
I guess he left.

01:46:59.708 --> 01:47:00.790
He is an illegal immigrant after all.

01:47:01.666 --> 01:47:03.665
What? This kid did not even say goodbye?

01:47:04.291 --> 01:47:05.499
So, what did you guys talk about?

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:07.374
Not much.

01:47:08.666 --> 01:47:09.874
Nothing important.

01:47:21.416 --> 01:47:22.707
Was it you who killed Lu Guofu?

01:47:25.166 --> 01:47:25.999
Are you kidding me?

01:47:28.666 --> 01:47:29.749
The first time I had doubts about you

01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:30.707
was in the library.

01:47:31.666 --> 01:47:33.040
Kiko told me that

01:47:33.291 --> 01:47:35.207
your name was on the check-out sheet.

01:47:35.208 --> 01:47:37.290
Of course you soon gave us
a reasonable explanation,

01:47:37.291 --> 01:47:39.999
Because someone told me it had a clue.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:40.957
Who?

01:47:40.958 --> 01:47:41.540
Q...

01:47:41.541 --> 01:47:42.832
but I still couldn't understand

01:47:42.916 --> 01:47:45.540
why the murderer had
to tear out the "Wu Ji Map".

01:47:45.541 --> 01:47:46.540
Someone ripped it off.

01:47:47.541 --> 01:47:48.874
You tore out the last page.

01:47:49.166 --> 01:47:50.582
What? Are you serious?

01:47:52.125 --> 01:47:53.749
Then tell me, why would I do that?

01:47:55.291 --> 01:47:56.874
Because after seeing this map

01:47:58.375 --> 01:48:01.790
you clearly understood the Killer's pattern.

01:48:03.583 --> 01:48:04.707
Wow, I must be a genius then.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:05.957
Found it!

01:48:06.958 --> 01:48:08.540
What is my reason for doing that?

01:48:09.666 --> 01:48:11.540
Because you didn't want me to see the map,

01:48:12.416 --> 01:48:14.165
so you could kill and blame it on him.

01:48:14.875 --> 01:48:16.040
Blame it on him?

01:48:17.625 --> 01:48:18.665
Let me finish.

01:48:20.250 --> 01:48:21.874
That night when we left the library...

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.665
It was you that led us
to the murderer in the park

01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:27.790
because you knew I suspected you.

01:48:28.291 --> 01:48:29.457
There's a park nearby.

01:48:29.708 --> 01:48:31.124
The benches are not bad to sleep on.

01:48:31.333 --> 01:48:32.332
And there was nothing better

01:48:32.833 --> 01:48:34.499
to dispel my suspicions about you

01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.290
than letting us witness the murderer in action.

01:48:37.208 --> 01:48:38.207
After the hospital visit,

01:48:38.208 --> 01:48:39.540
you thought we might get in your way,

01:48:40.125 --> 01:48:42.374
so you took the opportunity
to notify Lu Guofu about our whereabouts...

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.540
You drugged Lu Guofu,

01:48:44.958 --> 01:48:46.665
then took his lungs like the killer would.

01:48:46.958 --> 01:48:48.665
And then replaced the victim
at the Sugar Refinery

01:48:49.375 --> 01:48:50.624
with Lu Guofu's body.

01:48:50.875 --> 01:48:52.207
Where is the other corpse?

01:48:53.916 --> 01:48:55.957
I think it's inside the trunk
of the car you brought.

01:48:58.583 --> 01:49:00.540
I think that day you did not arrive with us.

01:49:01.208 --> 01:49:04.124
You were actually leaving the refinery
when you saw us...

01:49:04.833 --> 01:49:06.290
You must have calculated the timing

01:49:06.625 --> 01:49:08.790
and informed the other Detectives.

01:49:09.250 --> 01:49:11.290
But you couldn't have known that
Kiko would come to save us,

01:49:11.416 --> 01:49:12.540
which caused us to arrive earlier.

01:49:12.541 --> 01:49:14.957
It was "Q" who notified everyone.

01:49:15.541 --> 01:49:16.999
Remember our conversation that day?

01:49:17.041 --> 01:49:19.582
Could the killer be "Q"?

01:49:19.958 --> 01:49:22.124
He set you up,

01:49:22.583 --> 01:49:24.457
just like how I got set up in Thailand.

01:49:24.458 --> 01:49:25.249
What? Could that be?

01:49:28.250 --> 01:49:29.499
It's possible.

01:49:30.541 --> 01:49:32.040
Otherwise what's his purpose?

01:49:32.458 --> 01:49:35.207
You claimed you had been
following "Q" 's instructions.

01:49:36.041 --> 01:49:39.165
I couldn't figure out "Q" 's purpose behind it.

01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:42.249
You just said you must be a genius...

01:49:42.958 --> 01:49:44.249
True, it takes a genius to understand

01:49:44.250 --> 01:49:45.249
the killer's pattern

01:49:45.250 --> 01:49:46.540
just by reading a map.

01:49:48.916 --> 01:49:50.249
And that genius is you...

01:49:51.875 --> 01:49:53.290
you are "Q"!

01:49:56.083 --> 01:49:56.999
I am "Q"?

01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:59.874
Only "Q" could have figured it
all out ahead of me.

01:50:02.125 --> 01:50:02.874
What is it?

01:50:03.833 --> 01:50:05.457
The genius committed a perfect crime?

01:50:06.041 --> 01:50:07.582
Assuming you went to the first crime scene out

01:50:07.583 --> 01:50:08.707
of curiosity,

01:50:09.125 --> 01:50:12.040
then starting from the second victim, Jason Wu,

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.915
you must have planned it all out

01:50:15.625 --> 01:50:18.165
so you could be involved in this case

01:50:18.458 --> 01:50:20.082
in order to get close to Lu Guofu.

01:50:20.416 --> 01:50:22.749
Tang Ren and I are merely your tools.

01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:24.582
You did it

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.957
for your sister, didn't you?

01:50:28.625 --> 01:50:29.874
I checked Lu Guofu's background.

01:50:30.708 --> 01:50:32.707
He secretly ran an underground human
trafficking ring in New York,

01:50:32.708 --> 01:50:34.957
we haven't discussed the things

01:50:34.958 --> 01:50:35.999
selling illegal immigrants to South America

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.332
into prostitution.

01:50:37.333 --> 01:50:39.874
That you have done behind my back...

01:50:40.625 --> 01:50:42.249
A lot of women died because of him.

01:50:43.791 --> 01:50:44.540
Yes.

01:50:45.708 --> 01:50:46.707
He is a real scum.

01:50:51.083 --> 01:50:53.040
You theory is so good

01:50:53.208 --> 01:50:54.415
that I almost want to believe it.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.040
It was your right hand

01:50:57.416 --> 01:50:59.374
that dispelled my suspicion.

01:51:00.250 --> 01:51:02.207
Because after visiting the two crime scenes,

01:51:02.833 --> 01:51:04.915
you found out that the murderer
was actually left handed, like you.

01:51:05.833 --> 01:51:07.749
So you switched to use your right hand.

01:51:08.375 --> 01:51:10.207
Even when you got on the carriage

01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:11.540
you used your right hand!

01:51:12.291 --> 01:51:13.040
But...

01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:15.207
at the moment you saved me,

01:51:15.875 --> 01:51:17.290
you had no time to think

01:51:17.291 --> 01:51:18.790
and acted on instinct.

01:51:20.125 --> 01:51:21.249
That's when you used your left hand!

01:51:28.833 --> 01:51:30.082
Your "divine" action

01:51:30.875 --> 01:51:32.874
has revealed the beast inside of you.

01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:35.207
I saved you,

01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:38.124
and all you can think about is this.

01:51:40.041 --> 01:51:41.082
Chin Fong,

01:51:42.125 --> 01:51:43.249
are you a god or a beast?

01:51:45.625 --> 01:51:46.374
So you admit it?

01:51:47.958 --> 01:51:50.332
Why admit something you have no proof of?

01:51:50.666 --> 01:51:53.165
You must not have had time
to get rid of the body in your trunk.

01:51:55.125 --> 01:51:55.874
And these...

01:52:00.833 --> 01:52:02.624
I took them from your classroom.

01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.707
We can test them for fingerprints

01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:09.624
to see if you used the left hand
or the right hand.

01:52:12.958 --> 01:52:14.082
Should I do it?

01:52:21.666 --> 01:52:23.165
Do you remember that Crimaster case?

01:52:24.125 --> 01:52:25.832
The one who killed
the Government Official is the dog,

01:52:26.833 --> 01:52:28.540
but the one who replaced his dog
with a killer dog

01:52:28.541 --> 01:52:29.915
was his wife.

01:52:33.375 --> 01:52:35.082
It's not the animal that kills,

01:52:37.541 --> 01:52:39.249
but the barbarity.

01:53:16.666 --> 01:53:17.915
Chin Fong,

01:53:19.791 --> 01:53:21.915
When you stare at the abyss,

01:53:23.708 --> 01:53:25.707
the abyss stares back at you.

01:53:27.041 --> 01:53:28.124
So

01:53:29.250 --> 01:53:30.332
you can look,

01:53:34.583 --> 01:53:36.040
but not for too long.

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.790
Don't forget to call me if you ever come back.

01:53:44.875 --> 01:53:46.249
One word go, JIA! JIA! JIA! JIA!

01:53:46.291 --> 01:53:46.999
What??

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.999
I indeed mean to!

01:53:49.041 --> 01:53:50.582
Q's IP was deeply encrypted.

01:53:50.583 --> 01:53:52.457
I spent the entire night to decode it

01:53:52.666 --> 01:53:53.749
and you are right,

01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:55.040
he's not in Canada.

01:53:56.625 --> 01:53:57.582
I know.

01:53:58.500 --> 01:53:59.582
But he's not in the US either...

01:54:00.625 --> 01:54:01.374
What?

01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:02.374
He's not Q.

01:54:02.875 --> 01:54:03.874
Are you disappointed?

01:54:10.208 --> 01:54:11.499
If you do not let go,

01:54:11.666 --> 01:54:13.040
I will report you
for assaulting an officer of the law.

01:54:15.250 --> 01:54:17.499
This represents the long standing friendship
between China and the United States.

01:54:17.958 --> 01:54:19.124
Thank you, Tang Ren.

01:54:20.875 --> 01:54:21.749
No problem.

01:54:22.708 --> 01:54:23.832
Please visit Beijing

01:54:25.416 --> 01:54:26.165
when you have time.

01:54:26.166 --> 01:54:26.999
I have time right now!

01:54:28.291 --> 01:54:29.124
Right now?

01:54:29.166 --> 01:54:30.040
Yes,

01:54:30.666 --> 01:54:31.790
right now!

01:54:31.791 --> 01:54:34.415
You got it again and I didn't.

01:54:34.791 --> 01:54:35.832
How did I get it?

01:54:35.833 --> 01:54:37.499
Don't be stupid,

01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.207
don't you see what "right now" means?

01:54:39.250 --> 01:54:40.707
What does it mean?

01:54:40.708 --> 01:54:41.790
How do you write it in Pin Yin?

01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:44.040
LI-KE-YOU... like you!

01:54:44.041 --> 01:54:45.165
Kid,

01:54:45.208 --> 01:54:47.499
you should improve your English,

01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.207
or you won't be able to be my partner anymore.

01:54:49.958 --> 01:54:50.957
This is him...

01:54:51.875 --> 01:54:52.915
What?

01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:55.915
Such a difficult case!?

01:54:57.250 --> 01:54:59.457
Ok, I'm on it.

01:55:01.041 --> 01:55:02.249
- What...
- Old Chin,

01:55:02.250 --> 01:55:04.832
there is a huge case waiting.

01:55:04.875 --> 01:55:06.082
Forget about Beijing.

01:55:06.083 --> 01:55:07.790
We're changing our flight to Tokyo.

01:55:09.125 --> 01:55:10.832
NOOOOOO!!!

01:55:22.625 --> 01:55:25.915
Too difficult!!!

01:55:31.916 --> 01:55:35.207
Wait, where is Ah Xiang?

01:56:16.041 --> 01:56:17.540
Please...

01:56:17.708 --> 01:56:19.874
Old Chin, please...

01:56:19.916 --> 01:56:20.957
I lost the 5 million

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.040
and I lost Ah Xiang.

01:56:22.416 --> 01:56:24.540
All I'm asking is this...

01:56:25.166 --> 01:56:26.457
Please.

01:56:26.458 --> 01:56:27.207
Old Chin.

01:56:27.208 --> 01:56:28.207
Ah Xiang?

01:56:28.541 --> 01:56:29.707
Ah my ass!

01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:38.124
Ah Xiang!

01:56:38.208 --> 01:56:38.999
Tang Ren,

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.165
what are you doing here?

01:56:40.333 --> 01:56:41.082
Ah Xiang,

01:56:41.375 --> 01:56:43.082
did you come to find me?

01:56:43.125 --> 01:56:45.082
I knew you'd come to find me!

01:56:45.416 --> 01:56:46.790
I came here to find you.

01:56:47.541 --> 01:56:48.582
It's you.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.499
You son of a bitch.

01:56:51.666 --> 01:56:53.040
I've had it with you.

01:57:03.916 --> 01:57:04.874
Move you ass like this,

01:57:04.875 --> 01:57:05.832
and your hands this way,

01:57:05.833 --> 01:57:06.957
like this...

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.790
Old Chin, please.

01:57:28.916 --> 01:57:30.540
Please...

01:57:31.958 --> 01:57:33.665
Please...

01:57:38.291 --> 01:57:40.665
"'Crimaster' No.2
Detective Chinatown(Tang Ren, Chin Fong)"

01:58:50.916 --> 01:58:53.499
Happy Chinese New Year!

01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:56.749
Wishing you happiness and prosperity.
