00:00.300 --> 00:02.110
On the subject of babies...

00:02.160 --> 00:04.470
I would like a baby with you.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.550
I just moved in with my girlfriend, Tina.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.310
She was having an affair with my husband.

00:09.360 --> 00:13.270
- Probably best I don't come round for dinner.
- I'm focusing on Bridie.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.870
- All your eggs in one basket.
- Golden eggs.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.830
- You're fired.
- You fired Tracey?

00:18.880 --> 00:22.470
- I'd like to see you again.
- Should I come round to the house?

00:22.520 --> 00:24.750
Let's meet somewhere more discreet.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.160
Didn't catch your employer's name.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.550
Can I talk to you about something?

00:31.600 --> 00:33.440
Olivia's pregnant.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.950
Pregnant?

00:39.000 --> 00:42.960
How? I mean, I know how, but...

00:44.520 --> 00:47.030
how could you let this happen?

00:47.080 --> 00:49.080
I didn't mean to.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.240
Hiya.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074

01:04.200 --> 01:07.070
How far gone is she?

01:07.120 --> 01:10.270
- A couple of months.
- What? - Maybe three.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.640
Does Karen know?

01:13.120 --> 01:15.120
Jesus.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.750
Pathetic fallacy.

01:19.800 --> 01:23.110
Come on, Olivia, I thought you knew this.

01:23.160 --> 01:27.030
How about if Tess loses the
baby at the end of chapter three?

01:27.080 --> 01:29.590
- Yeah, well, that might work.
- Mum.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.910
- Ellie, have you got
this test tomorrow? - Um...

01:32.960 --> 01:36.990
- Yes. - Can you help your sister
revise? You might learn something.

01:37.040 --> 01:40.320
Come on, Bridie, let's take it next door.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.720
Have you two had a row?

01:56.240 --> 01:58.080
No.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.750
So, why aren't you talking?

02:00.800 --> 02:05.470
- Maybe we haven't got anything to say.
- That doesn't usually stop you.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.910
If you had had a row,
what would it be about?

02:08.960 --> 02:13.280
Look, we have not had a row, all right?

02:14.360 --> 02:16.880
They've so had a row.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.040
Liv doesn't want to tell her mum and dad.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.160
I'm not supposed to be telling you.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.350
We agreed to keep it a secret just...

02:34.400 --> 02:36.310
.. while we decide what's best.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.000
She'll have an abortion, won't she?

02:39.640 --> 02:42.360
It's not the only option, though, is it?

02:45.520 --> 02:47.760
She wants to keep it.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.120
Not her, no.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.360
Er, where, where is it we're, um...

03:23.520 --> 03:25.550
No, no. Get off!

03:29.000 --> 03:30.880
Argh!

03:33.600 --> 03:34.390
Please!

03:34.640 --> 03:37.070
I'm not just a financial advisor!

03:37.120 --> 03:39.240
I'm a father!

03:49.520 --> 03:52.840
- Why have you brought me here?
- The boss will explain.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.190
Mr Marsden, thanks for swinging by.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.760
- I'm not sure I had much
choice in the matter. - No.

04:06.800 --> 04:10.550
But if you'd known who it was, you
wouldn't exactly have come running.

04:10.600 --> 04:14.000
- Since I don't know who you are
I can't say. - Hazard a guess.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.519
Um...

04:19.440 --> 04:21.829
Are these your grandchildren, Ruby?

04:21.880 --> 04:24.750
They're my Gordon's kids.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.270
Maybe he should look
over this before I sign.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.790
These rates won't last for long.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.510
They're keeping him in till Friday.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.910
- Is Gordon in hospital?
- Prison. GBH.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.320
- Oh, shit.
- "Oh, shit" indeed.

04:40.920 --> 04:44.950
I explained that initially her
investment may appear to lose value.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.350
You're screwing my wife.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.790
- I'm sorry?
- You will be.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.430
- I don't even know her.
- You telling me this isn't you?

04:53.480 --> 04:55.830
Oh, God.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.550
So you're Nikki's husband?

04:58.600 --> 05:00.550
And this.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.670
- That's not how it looks. I can explain.
- I can't wait.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.600
I'm her financial advisor.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.470
Is that it? I admit you
didn't have a lot of time,

05:12.520 --> 05:15.830
but I was expecting something
a little more imaginative.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.350
It's the truth, which often is mundane.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.730
Snog at a hotel.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.950
It was just a peck on the cheek.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.870
Legging it from my house.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.950
- She didn't want you to
know I was there. - Oh.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.310
And why was that, then?

05:31.360 --> 05:33.670
This is our little secret, David.

05:33.720 --> 05:37.720
My husband mustn't know I'm
even contemplating leaving him.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.870
Well, she asked me not to tell you.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.200
And I'm asking that you do.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.680
So, which one of us are
you going disappoint? Hm?

05:53.720 --> 05:56.790
- Where's David?
- Er, I don't know.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.230
- Um, on a date.
- Really?

05:59.280 --> 06:02.700
Nah. He doesn't use the
Internet, that's his only chance.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.910
What about that colleague of yours?

06:06.960 --> 06:09.710
- What colleague?
- The one you like.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.550
Sarah.

06:11.600 --> 06:15.590
- I don't like her that much.
- You told me you thought she was attractive.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.550
- Nah. She wouldn't be interested.
- Right. I'm off.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.590
Good luck, son.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.720
Bye.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.040
Olivia's pregnant.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.870
- Nikki, it's David Marsden.
- 'David. How are you?'

06:51.920 --> 06:54.430
- I've just met your husband.
- George?

06:54.480 --> 06:57.990
- He'd seen me on the CCTV at your house.
- That's his business --

06:58.040 --> 07:00.280
home security.

07:02.280 --> 07:06.110
Listen, if he asks
you're opening a nail bar.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.750
- What? - Well, it's a sort
of salon where women go to...

07:09.800 --> 07:11.990
Yeah, I know what a nail bar is.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.550
He thinks you've asked me to
help you write a business plan.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.750
- Whatever you think's best, David.
- It's not Olivia.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.350
- My son's the one having second thoughts.
- Matt wants to keep it?

07:22.400 --> 07:24.150
Are they crazy?

07:24.200 --> 07:26.190
I know. That's what I told him.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.510
Oh, no.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.830
Matthew, no, son. That is crazy.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.670
- You're 16, she's 17!
- It's no worse than you at 50!

07:34.720 --> 07:36.470
49.

07:36.520 --> 07:40.350
- I'm not still at school!
- But we love each other, Dad!

07:40.400 --> 07:42.350
- Oh.
- We can make this work.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.120
Matthew, son, it's not that easy. Jesus!

07:49.520 --> 07:50.310
Come here.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.390
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, don't worry.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.750
Did you manage to persuade him?

07:55.800 --> 07:57.790
Well, no, but Karen will.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.430
- I've managed to convince him to tell her.
- What about David?

08:00.480 --> 08:05.190
That's up to Olivia and Karen,
but, first things first.

08:05.240 --> 08:09.000
- Matt's going around there to tell
Karen now. - By himself? - Mm-hm.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.640
Adam. I can't really see
that happening, can you?

08:13.800 --> 08:16.190
- No.
- No.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.910
Do you think I should do it?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.830
You could do it. You'd be good at that.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.550
Oh, no, I'm not going to...

08:23.600 --> 08:25.600
I've just been abducted.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.350
- Dropped round on Mum
and Sheila earlier. - Oh.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.390
Did you have to use the sat nav?

08:37.440 --> 08:39.390
That's hilarious.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.750
Anyway, I do visit when I can.

08:41.799 --> 08:45.590
It's just, I'm not needed as much
now, with Sheila living with her.

08:45.640 --> 08:49.670
- Jen, visiting your mum isn't
meant to be based on need. - Oh.

08:49.720 --> 08:54.030
Anyway, Sheila had some news,

08:54.080 --> 08:57.910
and you are never in a million years

08:57.960 --> 08:59.990
- going to guess what it is.
- She's met someone.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.670
You've met someone?!

09:01.720 --> 09:03.710
Well, don't sound so surprised.

09:03.760 --> 09:07.230
I'm a very attractive
woman, so Marvin says.

09:08.580 --> 09:09.750
Marvin!

09:09.800 --> 09:12.190
Ooh. Does his guide dog agree?

09:13.240 --> 09:14.870
Ask her where they met.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.150
Through the church, I imagine.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.550
Over the Internet.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.640
- Oh, God, he's not on death row, is he?
- No, he's Canadian.

09:26.620 --> 09:29.390
Oh, come on, Jen, you could've
been a bit more supportive.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.430
Oh, I was only joking.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.830
- Well, did she laugh?
- Not so much. - Right.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.910
Tell you what, I'm going
to call her myself.

09:37.960 --> 09:42.560
- Tell her how pleased I am
to hear her news. - Great.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.760
Saint bloody Peter.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.590
We're not going to publish this year

09:57.640 --> 10:00.160
unless you agree to any changes!

10:00.840 --> 10:01.970
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:02.020 --> 10:03.760
It'll take as long as it takes!

10:03.810 --> 10:06.470
- Kids. - Yeah. - Tea? - Yeah.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.880
Matt, your dad's here!

10:09.280 --> 10:11.750
Ramona, can you answer the phone?

10:11.800 --> 10:13.790
I'm already on the phone!

10:13.840 --> 10:17.350
- I don't pay you to talk to your mother.
- Bueno. Tengo que ir, Mama.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.950
- Si, la jefe me llama, siempre trabajo...
- How are things?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.990
Er, yeah, um, good.

10:23.040 --> 10:27.270
Er, about that, er, have you got a moment?

10:27.320 --> 10:30.390
- Well, if I did I'd spend
it lying in a bath. - Hm.

10:30.440 --> 10:33.150
- Why, what's up?
- Dad, what are you doing here?

10:33.200 --> 10:36.150
- Come to take you home I imagine. - Ah.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.080
Probably. Olivia.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.590
Son, um, do you think
this might be a good time

10:46.640 --> 10:49.200
- to, er...
- Go? Yeah.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.750
- I've got an essay to
write. Biology. - Mm.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.270
Which, as we know, is not
your strongest subject.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.430
Karen, is Benjamin.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.710
I'm so sorry, I have to
take that. Will it keep?

11:01.760 --> 11:04.400
Yes. Yeah, it will.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.430
Benjamin, hi.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.720
- Guys.
- Please.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.080
Come on.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.960
- Is, er, this the queue for tea? - Hm?

11:49.320 --> 11:51.470
Sorry. No, help yourself.

11:51.520 --> 11:54.870
Um, 500 teas here, no English Breakfast.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.710
Oh, pineapple and redcurrant. Very you.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.750
Yeah, perhaps if it came with a
vodka and an umbrella, otherwise no.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.630
Yeah, I bring my own. Irish Breakfast?

12:04.680 --> 12:06.990
Oh, good man. Thanks.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.350
So, look, I've been thinking.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.150
Your girlfriend and my husband's
fling needn't stop us being friends.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.910
- She wasn't my girlfriend at the time.
- He was my husband.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.800
- Still is.
- You took him back?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.680
We tried to make another go
of it after Tina chose you.

12:25.480 --> 12:29.550
I thought we were doing
pretty well until he left.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.880
- Sarah, I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.070
Have you told her we're working together?

12:37.120 --> 12:41.040
Um, no, that, er, hasn't come up.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.230
Listen, we've got to be friends.

12:45.280 --> 12:49.110
You're the only person here who's
my vintage or gets my jokes.

12:49.160 --> 12:53.800
- Oh, no, they do get them. They just
don't find them funny. - Oh, I see.

12:59.240 --> 13:02.110
- Did you get my apology?
- Yes, thank you.

13:02.160 --> 13:05.910
- You said you had a business proposition?
- You lied to me.

13:05.960 --> 13:09.870
Look, I swear, I'm NOT having
an affair with your wife.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.680
Relax, I'm talking about the nail bar.

13:14.640 --> 13:18.430
- Nikki told me everything. - Oh.
- She's been unhappy, I didn't notice.

13:18.480 --> 13:22.190
I've been busy. She said you were
going help her squirrel money away

13:22.240 --> 13:25.350
- to fund a future escape.
- I wouldn't go that far.

13:25.400 --> 13:29.120
- I think she just wanted options.
- Yeah, well, I understand.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.710
I'm impressed by the advice you gave her.

13:33.760 --> 13:37.670
Better than I've been getting.
I've just fired my financial guy.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.630
- Because of me?
- Because he's a lazy sod.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.510
My affairs were all over the shop,

13:42.560 --> 13:46.190
and now the tax man's
breathing down my neck.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.430
- And he has halitosis.
- Yeah.

13:48.480 --> 13:52.590
I've checked you out. You've had
your run-ins with the authorities.

13:52.640 --> 13:56.480
Cut a fair few corners as I
heard it. Got away with it, mind.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.110
I like that.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.710
- You could be useful to me.
- What about Nikki? - We've made up.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.280
Besides, what's mine is hers.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.390
Well, half is on divorce.

14:09.440 --> 14:13.070
Speaking from experience,
it needn't be that much.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.650
I knew you were the right man.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.590
It's Bingo time. Eyes
down, hearing aids up.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.440
Here's your first number.

14:24.680 --> 14:28.150
Oh. Average life expectancy
of a Glaswegian...

14:28.200 --> 14:29.880
56.

14:30.680 --> 14:34.670
I don't know, Trace. Jen's not
as charitable as she used to be.

14:34.720 --> 14:38.400
That's the pressure of being
management. It's not her fault.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.360
Granny's gone to heaven, 87.

14:47.840 --> 14:51.470
You're very forgiving,
considering she gave you the boot.

14:51.520 --> 14:55.640
I'm sure it's just a phase. She'll
be back to herself in no time.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.430
- 69.
- Yep.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.310
Oh.

15:08.360 --> 15:12.510
- Jen? - What did you say to
Sheila about this bloke of hers?

15:12.560 --> 15:15.550
Nothing. I just made encouraging noises.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.590
Argh! You idiot!

15:17.640 --> 15:21.280
She's only gone and booked
a flight to go and see him.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.230
You assured me it would
be out by Christmas.

15:28.280 --> 15:32.110
- I said if it all goes well. Well, it isn't.
- Can I have a word, please?

15:32.160 --> 15:35.830
- Not now. - Miss that deadline,
we can kiss our investment goodbye.

15:35.880 --> 15:39.510
- I am fully aware of the repercussions.
- It's very important.

15:39.560 --> 15:43.550
- What part of "not now" don't you understand?
- Yo intendo todo, senora!

15:43.600 --> 15:46.950
Carry on like that and you'll be on
the next train home to Torremolinos!

15:47.000 --> 15:49.270
Karen, focus. You need to
get Bridie under control.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.550
How dare you accuse me!

15:51.600 --> 15:53.670
- I caught you in my room!
- Not again!

15:53.720 --> 15:56.110
- I need to talk to you.
- Not now!

15:56.160 --> 15:58.270
- Where's it gone, then?
- How dare you accuse me!

15:58.320 --> 15:59.950
What's going on?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.550
- I had a wrap of coke in my room.
- That's Josh's room.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.950
- She's nicked it. - What?
- I was looking for my hairbrush.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.830
- Are you doing drugs?
- No!

16:07.880 --> 16:11.670
- A little weed, but she's doing coke!
- She took it. It was in my purse!

16:11.720 --> 16:15.030
- I wasn't in your purse!
- Ellie, don't walk away from me.

16:15.080 --> 16:18.070
Why are you cross with me? She
brought cocaine into the house!

16:18.120 --> 16:21.310
- You're the one who stole it!
- We will talk.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.230
- Ellie, have you got that cocaine?
- No! Why are you believing her?

16:24.280 --> 16:26.550
- I know what you're like!
- What's that mean?

16:26.600 --> 16:28.750
You've just admitted that you smoke weed.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.470
- All the kids do!
- They don't.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.110
- Your sister doesn't.
- Oh, no, she's Little Miss Perfect.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.870
- She works hard, doesn't steal.
- Neither do I!

16:37.920 --> 16:41.800
- Why can't you be more like her?
- Oh, what, pregnant?

16:45.760 --> 16:47.560
Oh.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.310
- I'll be gone a fortnight.
- Two weeks?

16:59.360 --> 17:01.630
I do believe that's a fortnight, yes.

17:01.680 --> 17:05.270
- What if you don't like this fella?
- Then I'll come back early.

17:05.319 --> 17:08.069
But there's no risk, we get on so well.

17:08.119 --> 17:12.119
- Yeah, online. - It is much harder
when you're breathing the same air.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.990
Oh, good news. He's kosher.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.869
- Jewish?
- No. He checks out.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.910
His picture's on the
Mounted Police website.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.310
- I told you he was a Mountie.
- And...

17:24.359 --> 17:26.630
wait, he's got a Facebook page.

17:26.680 --> 17:31.070
His hobbies include
hiking... and bell-ringing.

17:31.120 --> 17:34.590
- Mm, he's a campanologist.
- It doesn't mention his sexuality.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.710
- I'll let you know.
- Urgh!

17:37.760 --> 17:41.950
- Whilst I'm gone you'll have to check on Mom.
- I won't need checking on.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.990
Since I've been living with her
I've noticed a deterioration.

17:46.040 --> 17:49.790
Probably doesn't help you insisting
on doing everything for her.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.510
Oh, God. Sorry.

17:52.560 --> 17:56.630
Look, it has been amazing
you being on hand.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.950
I couldn't do what you do.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.350
For the next two weeks you're going
to have to. That's a fortnight.

18:03.400 --> 18:07.400
Well, no, sorry. I'm way too busy.
You'll do it, won't you, pet?

18:08.200 --> 18:10.390
Oh, it's pet now, is it?

18:17.640 --> 18:21.550
I always thought that anyone
who got pregnant as a teenager

18:21.600 --> 18:24.000
was a complete idiot.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.030
- Turns out that idiot is me.
- No, you listen.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.840
Accidents can happen to anyone, Olivia.

18:32.080 --> 18:36.440
- I'm just sorry you felt you couldn't
tell me, darling. - I tried to.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.070
I wanted to, but...

18:39.120 --> 18:42.630
you're under so much pressure
trying to finish this book.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.910
You don't need me adding to your problems.

18:44.960 --> 18:49.950
There is nothing more important
to me than you, OK? Nothing.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.030
Oh, please don't tell Dad!

18:53.080 --> 18:56.880
- Oh, darling, we have to.
- He'll be so disappointed.

18:58.480 --> 19:02.520
At least wait until me and Matt
have decided what we're going to do.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.270
What are you thinking?

19:06.320 --> 19:09.590
Matt doesn't want me to have an abortion.

19:09.640 --> 19:12.510
Well, not really Matt's decision, darling.

19:12.560 --> 19:16.840
I know, but I want us to
be in agreement about it.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.830
OK.

19:19.880 --> 19:23.070
Well, we'll have to talk to him. Hm?

19:23.120 --> 19:26.590
- Maybe tell Adam so he can.
- Oh, Adam already knows.

19:33.980 --> 19:34.960
Hi, Tina.

19:37.940 --> 19:40.110
How could you not tell me?

19:40.160 --> 19:42.950
I tried to. I only found out yesterday.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.430
- That is not something you sit on.
- You shooed me out!

19:46.480 --> 19:48.550
- You shouldn't have let me!
- I did tell him that.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.350
What, you knew?

19:50.400 --> 19:52.910
- Have you told David yet?
- No, I have not.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.830
I'm not going to. She can have the
abortion, he'll be none the wiser.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.150
- So she's decided to have one?
- She won't make the appointment,

20:00.200 --> 20:02.990
- not until Matt's on board.
- You know what they're like at that age.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.150
They watch Romeo and Juliet,

20:05.200 --> 20:07.390
think theirs is the greatest
love story ever told.

20:07.440 --> 20:11.350
- He's a hopeless romantic.
- I've tried to talk sense into him.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.910
Try harder! He needs to be supporting her!

20:13.960 --> 20:16.150
- I can't tell him what to think!
- You can!

20:16.200 --> 20:18.790
- That's not how I father my son!
- You didn't father him at all

20:18.840 --> 20:20.990
- when he was away at school!
- Whoa!

20:21.040 --> 20:22.990
No! Don't you be so touchy-feely!

20:23.040 --> 20:26.190
- It's Matt's fault we're in this mess!
- Olivia didn't take the pill!

20:26.240 --> 20:30.550
All right. I think it's fair
to say they're both responsible.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.990
- Evening, all. - Oh,
Jesus. - Oh, Jesus.

20:33.040 --> 20:36.630
- Oh, Karen, what are you doing here?
- I was just on my way out.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.390
Oh, you can share my good news.

20:38.440 --> 20:40.750
I've just been offered a
major piece of new business.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.830
Well, I am very pleased for you, David.

20:45.380 --> 20:47.770
Oh. She might've been more enthusiastic.

20:57.380 --> 20:58.570
David.

20:59.220 --> 21:01.220
Robyn, hi.

21:05.100 --> 21:09.700
- May I? - Oh, thank you. Glass of
Chablis. Make sure it's chilled.

21:12.060 --> 21:14.060
Thank you.

21:15.500 --> 21:20.170
So, you look well. Are you seeing someone?

21:20.220 --> 21:24.210
- Oh, that's your first question?
- Your wardrobe's improved.

21:24.260 --> 21:27.220
Oh, thanks. I'm not, as it happens.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.540
Why, are you regretting our divorce?

21:31.940 --> 21:34.100
Olivia came to see me earlier.

21:35.380 --> 21:38.700
- She wanted my advice.
- What, about a career in the law?

21:40.060 --> 21:44.900
That's what I expected it to
be about, and it was, in a way.

21:45.340 --> 21:48.580
When, do you think, is the, um,

21:49.220 --> 21:51.540
the best time to have a baby?

21:52.100 --> 21:55.490
- Nine months after getting pregnant.
- No, I mean,

21:55.540 --> 21:58.820
- from the perspective
of your career. - Ah.

21:59.740 --> 22:01.930
Well, the best time is never.

22:01.980 --> 22:05.290
If I'd had a child I'd have
a desk now, not an office.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.570
Do you regret your choices?

22:07.620 --> 22:10.930
That's what we lawyers call a moot point.

22:10.980 --> 22:15.130
Oh, um, open to debate but
of no practical application.

22:18.180 --> 22:23.090
If you had your time again
and found you were pregnant

22:23.140 --> 22:27.930
at say, oh, I don't know, 17,

22:27.980 --> 22:30.020
would you keep the baby?

22:31.380 --> 22:35.660
- I'm asking for a friend.
- One of Olivia's friends is pregnant?

22:36.740 --> 22:38.770
I wonder who it could be.

22:38.820 --> 22:41.180
Olivia's pregnant, David.

22:50.100 --> 22:53.930
Mum knows I'm leaving tomorrow.
She's done this on purpose.

22:53.980 --> 22:57.290
Oh, Sheila, calm down. Where
did she say she was going?

22:57.340 --> 23:00.330
- I don't know, I wasn't listening.
- Maybe she's gone to the shops.

23:00.380 --> 23:03.010
She's been gone four hours,

23:03.060 --> 23:06.650
and anyway, I do the shopping.
She can't be relied upon any more.

23:06.700 --> 23:09.090
- Have you called her friends?
- I called you.

23:09.140 --> 23:14.010
Well, call them, then call me. To
be honest, I've got people over.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.060
Oh, charming.

23:20.220 --> 23:23.130
- Oh, God.
- Was everything all right, love?

23:23.180 --> 23:25.450
- Mom's gone missing.
- What?

23:25.500 --> 23:29.250
- I mean, she hasn't. Sheila's being
a drama queen. - Runs in the family.

23:29.300 --> 23:32.250
- Can we order, please? I'm starving.
- Shouldn't we wait for David?

23:32.300 --> 23:34.370
- Where is he?
- He met Robyn for a drink.

23:34.420 --> 23:37.570
- I'll have a Supreme.
- Robyn? Why? - I don't know.

23:37.620 --> 23:39.970
- I think I'll have the Four Seasons.
- You always do.

23:40.020 --> 23:44.090
- I'll just have the same as
Adam. - Supreme. - Funky Chicken!

23:44.140 --> 23:48.970
- I want a Margherita with olives.
- Hang on, I can't keep up!

23:49.020 --> 23:51.250
Hi, hi, yeah. Order a pizza, please.

23:51.300 --> 23:54.820
Hi, David. What kind
of pizza would you like?

23:55.140 --> 24:00.330
- David?
- Olivia is pregnant by your son.

24:00.380 --> 24:02.530
Bloody hell.

24:02.580 --> 24:05.530
- You knew?
- David, what pizza would you like?

24:05.580 --> 24:08.050
- Why didn't anyone tell me?
- David, choose a pizza.

24:08.100 --> 24:10.850
- She's a virgin.
- Sorry, I'll have to call you back.

24:10.900 --> 24:14.410
- I'm so sorry. We should've told you.
- Had to find out about it from Robyn.

24:14.460 --> 24:17.330
- Robyn? - Seems I'm the last
to know. - We didn't know.

24:17.380 --> 24:19.530
- How does she know?
- Know what?

24:19.580 --> 24:21.770
- Olivia went to see her?
- Olivia's up the duff.

24:21.820 --> 24:25.730
- Bloody hell!
- They'll think my daughter's a slut.

24:25.780 --> 24:27.690
- David!
- She's 17!

24:27.740 --> 24:29.690
Maybe we should all just pull back here.

24:29.740 --> 24:34.650
- Pity your blasted son
didn't. - Bastard? - Blasted.

24:34.700 --> 24:37.690
- Olivia wants to have an abortion, OK?
- Oh, my God.

24:37.740 --> 24:40.050
- Once Matt's used to the idea.
- What's it to do with him?

24:40.100 --> 24:45.730
- He's the father! - It's Olivia's
choice and I support her whatever.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.930
Sorry, excuse me.

24:47.980 --> 24:51.210
- It's Matt. Hi.
- Hey, Dad.

24:51.260 --> 24:54.210
- Are you with Karen?
- Yeah. And David.

24:54.260 --> 24:57.090
He knows.

24:57.140 --> 24:59.620
Oh. Er, one sec.

25:01.340 --> 25:03.330
No. No, it's fine.

25:03.380 --> 25:07.100
- Can you put them on as well, please?
- Oh, all right.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.130
Gather round.

25:09.180 --> 25:12.250
Er, hey, Mum.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.650
- Dad. - Hi, darling. - Olivia.

25:14.700 --> 25:18.570
So, Liv and I have
talked everything through.

25:18.620 --> 25:21.290
I explained to Matt that
being a single mum at my age

25:21.340 --> 25:22.970
really isn't a great idea.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.770
- And I totally get that.
- Thank God.

25:25.820 --> 25:29.530
Which is why...

25:29.580 --> 25:33.490
- I've asked Liv to marry me.
- Excuse me?

25:34.540 --> 25:37.020
- And, um, I've said yes.
- What?

25:38.580 --> 25:41.620
- You're going to be grandparents!
- Oh, sweet Jesus.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.090
Look, the police are on it.

26:06.140 --> 26:09.770
- There's nothing we can do but wait.
- This is my fault.

26:09.820 --> 26:13.530
I knew she couldn't
cope with me going away.

26:13.580 --> 26:16.090
- Have they found Grandma yet?
- No.

26:16.140 --> 26:18.810
- Ring her mobile.
- I did.

26:18.860 --> 26:21.020
Ring it again.

26:23.580 --> 26:24.530
It's Grandma.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.660
Come here.

26:27.780 --> 26:30.570
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm not sure, love,

26:30.620 --> 26:34.370
but there's a nice young man
here. I'll ask him to explain.

26:34.420 --> 26:37.730
- She's OK. - Oh. - I'll kill her.

26:37.780 --> 26:40.140
Right. If we could come to order.

26:42.820 --> 26:45.890
So, the first item on the agenda.

26:45.940 --> 26:49.730
- Why are you sat at the
head of the table? - What?

26:49.780 --> 26:52.970
- Well, it's not really fair, is it?
- It doesn't matter.

26:53.020 --> 26:56.860
- Do you want to sit here?
- Really? - No, no, no, it's fine.

27:00.420 --> 27:04.410
- So, the first item on the agenda.
- We really don't need an agenda.

27:04.460 --> 27:07.490
- We all know what we're here for.
- Right.

27:07.540 --> 27:10.020
So, who wants to go first?

27:18.020 --> 27:20.730
♪ It's funny how it tears me apart

27:20.780 --> 27:24.130
I told you this wasn't the right way.

♪ First it breaks your
head then your heart

Why am I in the back?

27:29.540 --> 27:31.700
Because you're the youngest.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.340
I'm 48.

27:35.780 --> 27:38.450
And three quarters.

27:38.500 --> 27:41.620
♪ It's chewing at my bones and my brains

27:42.460 --> 27:46.260
♪ It's working through
the flesh that remains

27:46.980 --> 27:50.020
♪ Why can't this feeling leave me

27:50.900 --> 27:52.970
♪ And just fade away? ♪

27:53.020 --> 27:56.490
There you are! What are you
doing all the way out here?

27:56.540 --> 27:58.650
I thought I'd visit Irene.

27:58.700 --> 28:01.290
- Who's Irene?
- My sister.

28:01.340 --> 28:06.060
- Out Halifax way.
- Oh, Mum. She's long dead.

28:06.540 --> 28:09.250
- I told you.
- I meant her grave.

28:09.300 --> 28:13.010
It's round here somewhere.
I couldn't find it.

28:13.060 --> 28:16.690
- I ran out of petrol in the middle of nowhere.
- Why didn't you call?

28:16.740 --> 28:18.740
My phone had died.

28:19.660 --> 28:23.170
I don't know any of
your numbers. I used to.

28:23.220 --> 28:25.690
Well, your memory's not what it was.

28:25.740 --> 28:28.730
For God's sake. Nobody
knows numbers any more.

28:28.780 --> 28:31.780
- It's all right.
- I slept in the car.

28:33.700 --> 28:36.900
- I thought I was going to die.
- Oh.

28:38.180 --> 28:41.370
Oh, you've missed your flight.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.580
I'm just glad you're safe.

28:45.500 --> 28:49.210
- You are not getting married.
- We don't need your permission.

28:49.260 --> 28:53.290
I think what Dad means to
say is, is that a good idea?

28:53.340 --> 28:57.090
Marriage, it isn't something
you just rush into.

28:57.140 --> 29:00.770
Says the man whose last one
lasted all but six weeks.

29:00.820 --> 29:04.650
We will support you, OK, in
whatever decision you make.

29:04.700 --> 29:09.410
- We're having the baby. - You need
to think through all the consequences.

29:09.460 --> 29:13.250
- We have. - Have you? Where
are you going to live?

29:13.300 --> 29:16.730
Well, we hadn't thought that far ahead.

29:16.780 --> 29:20.450
- It's really not that far ahead.
- We can live with you, can't we?

29:20.500 --> 29:23.730
- You can forget any sort of a career.
- I can still study!

29:23.780 --> 29:27.330
- You'll help with babysitting.
- Yeah, but, you know,

29:27.380 --> 29:30.010
Tina and I might have our own plans now.

29:30.060 --> 29:33.930
- Your mum's time is taken up with
her business. - Thank you, David.

29:33.980 --> 29:37.290
- Where were you when we were bringing
up our three? - Childcare, then.

29:37.340 --> 29:41.650
- How will you pay for it?
- I'll get a job, outside of school.

29:41.700 --> 29:43.620
Like a paper round?

29:45.060 --> 29:48.010
Let's look at the alternative.

29:48.060 --> 29:51.020
Having an, er, er, a termination.

29:53.780 --> 29:57.410
Listen, Matt, um, I haven't
told you this before,

29:57.460 --> 30:00.530
but your mother had an abortion

30:00.580 --> 30:03.980
- a couple of years before
you were born. - Really?

30:06.900 --> 30:11.570
- So I could've had an older
brother? - Yeah. - Look, er,

30:11.620 --> 30:14.690
your mum and dad were on a break.

30:14.740 --> 30:17.290
I don't think we were on a...

30:17.340 --> 30:22.090
OK, look, the point is things
could've been very different.

30:22.140 --> 30:24.570
You might not even have been born.

30:24.620 --> 30:26.860
Eh? And your mother...

30:28.140 --> 30:31.290
I know that she never
regretted her decision.

30:31.340 --> 30:34.330
On balance, then, perhaps it's difficult

30:34.380 --> 30:37.690
to find an argument in
favour of keeping it.

30:37.740 --> 30:41.330
I can think of one, which
none of you have considered

30:41.380 --> 30:43.900
- for even a second.
- Hm?

30:44.540 --> 30:49.370
Right now inside Liv's belly
is a little boy or little girl.

30:49.420 --> 30:52.580
OK, it looks like a tadpole,

30:54.180 --> 30:58.460
but it can kick and punch and...

30:59.420 --> 31:01.060
swallow.

31:02.140 --> 31:04.540
And it came from me and Liv.

31:06.380 --> 31:10.610
- And you're all saying kill it
without hesitation. - Look, wait...

31:10.660 --> 31:12.650
- Matt.
- This is about our screw-up,

31:12.700 --> 31:16.370
- not learning from mistakes
you've all made. - Matt's right.

31:16.420 --> 31:19.210
- We'll decide.
- No, what? Wait.

31:19.260 --> 31:22.300
Matthew? Son, come...

31:31.060 --> 31:33.220
There it is.

31:37.580 --> 31:39.580
Irene Louise.

31:40.740 --> 31:43.340
Ahh. She died very young.

31:45.580 --> 31:48.380
I still miss her.

31:51.700 --> 31:53.700
Come on, give us a squirt.

31:56.860 --> 31:58.660
OK.

32:25.260 --> 32:27.260
Pub?

32:44.700 --> 32:46.420
Hello?

32:47.700 --> 32:50.300
- Gosh, what's happened to you?
- Um...

32:51.980 --> 32:55.090
George beat seven shades
of shit out of me.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.970
- What?
- Oh.

32:58.020 --> 33:01.410
I've got to stop doing that
because it hurts. I'm joking.

33:01.460 --> 33:04.370
- I've had a nose job.
- Really? - Mm. - Why?

33:04.420 --> 33:08.130
It was a present from George.
I've always hated my nose.

33:08.180 --> 33:10.290
I couldn't see anything wrong with it.

33:10.340 --> 33:13.810
- You weren't looking closely enough.
- It looks bloody painful. - It is.

33:13.860 --> 33:16.490
I'm on a cocktail of
painkillers and cocktails.

33:16.540 --> 33:18.130
It helps take the edge off.

33:18.180 --> 33:21.250
I look forward to seeing
the Mona Lisa results.

33:21.300 --> 33:24.970
God, I hope it's better than hers. I
was just saying how I broke my nose.

33:25.020 --> 33:28.250
- Your car accident?
- George thinks I should be embarrassed

33:28.300 --> 33:30.850
- to talk about plastic surgery. - No.

33:30.900 --> 33:34.730
I thought you were. I've had my last bloke

33:34.780 --> 33:38.610
send over my accounts for you
to look at. Can we have coffee?

33:38.660 --> 33:42.810
- Yeah, cup or a mug?
- I think perhaps a large pot.

33:43.460 --> 33:45.410
Preferably strong.

33:45.460 --> 33:48.450
- It doesn't work!
- Bridie, you haven't tried.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.890
Sorry, I know you don't
want me to disturb you.

33:51.940 --> 33:55.650
- So why are you? - It's Benjamin.
- Tell the little twerp I'm out.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.930
- No, this is my sister. He's here.
- You seem a little on edge, Karen.

33:59.980 --> 34:02.180
No shit, Sherlock.

34:04.380 --> 34:05.570
Disturbingly so.

34:05.620 --> 34:09.650
Do you what Benjamin, I've got one
daughter who is pregnant at 17,

34:09.699 --> 34:11.409
another one who may or
may not be doing drugs --

34:11.460 --> 34:14.210
either way I have no idea, I can't believe
a word that comes out of her mouth,

34:14.260 --> 34:17.690
an author who's too smart to
listen to any sound advice,

34:17.739 --> 34:21.050
a PA who's incompetent,
and a business partner

34:21.100 --> 34:24.330
who I'm guessing isn't about
to give me any good news. Right?

34:24.380 --> 34:28.130
About all of it or just the last bit?

34:28.179 --> 34:30.620
As it happens you are.

34:34.100 --> 34:36.010
I'm dissolving our partnership.

34:36.060 --> 34:39.650
I assume you can't afford my
share so I shall buy you out.

34:39.699 --> 34:43.690
- You're forcing me out of my own business?
- You can't cope, Karen.

34:43.739 --> 34:46.130
This way you'll receive a
return for your efforts.

34:46.179 --> 34:47.860
I'll see myself out.

34:53.860 --> 34:55.980
- Here you go. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

34:58.700 --> 35:02.090
- What did you get?
- Pistachio and goji berry.

35:02.140 --> 35:05.250
- It's minging.
- So what's new in your world?

35:05.300 --> 35:09.010
Oh, nothing much. I'm
going to be a grandad.

35:09.060 --> 35:12.530
Oh, congratulations.

35:12.580 --> 35:15.010
Yeah. My son's 16.

35:15.060 --> 35:17.330
- How old is the girl?
- 17.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.450
So at least that's good news.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.580
Her parents are old friends of mine.

35:22.380 --> 35:25.330
We're not so friendly at present, though.

35:25.380 --> 35:29.180
Oh, never mind. You have
new friends to compensate.

35:31.020 --> 35:33.010
You coming to this meeting?

35:33.060 --> 35:35.330
- Is it in the treehouse?
- On the beanbags.

35:35.380 --> 35:38.530
Don't worry, I'll help
you to your feet, Grandad.

35:38.580 --> 35:40.860
Cheeky bastard.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.180
(Shit.)

35:56.340 --> 36:00.330
I tried your idea, about
the ending. It works.

36:00.380 --> 36:02.690
- Yeah. - I'm going to
go home to write it.

36:02.740 --> 36:05.020
I think that would be best.

36:10.260 --> 36:14.020
- Oh. - Oh, my God,
are you crying? - No.

36:15.340 --> 36:18.740
Don't worry, Ramona. I
won't let Benjamin win.

36:20.180 --> 36:22.090
What?

36:22.140 --> 36:24.210
I'm sorry, why are you upset?

36:24.260 --> 36:26.290
It doesn't matter.

36:26.340 --> 36:28.450
Oh, you had a call.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.570
Um, I forgot to write down who from.

36:31.620 --> 36:35.130
- Ramona, what is it?
- My mother.

36:35.180 --> 36:38.490
She had a heart attack a few days ago.

36:38.540 --> 36:41.490
- Oh, my God, why didn't
you tell me? - I tried.

36:41.540 --> 36:44.210
Oh. Well, is she OK?

36:44.260 --> 36:47.530
I don't know. She's in the hospital.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.690
My sister's with her. They don't get on.

36:50.740 --> 36:53.610
- Well, do you want to see her?
- My sister?

36:53.660 --> 36:57.970
- No, your mother.
- I can't go. You need me here.

36:58.020 --> 37:01.450
- No, no, no, I want you to.
- Are you firing me?

37:01.500 --> 37:04.610
No. The thought had
crossed my mind, Ramona.

37:04.660 --> 37:08.050
But, no, honestly, your job's
safe, but you've got to go.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.980
It's family. It's the
most important thing.

37:12.220 --> 37:14.290
- Thanks.
- Mum?

37:14.340 --> 37:17.460
- Do you have a moment?
- Yeah.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.820
- You OK?
- Yeah.

37:36.700 --> 37:38.700
You OK?

37:40.180 --> 37:42.970
I've made an appointment at the clinic.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.020
I'm going to have an abortion.

37:49.860 --> 37:53.460
OK. Does Matt know?

37:57.740 --> 38:00.940
Yeah, he agrees it's
the right thing to do.

38:05.260 --> 38:07.730
You know, you and Liv, Matt,

38:07.780 --> 38:11.770
you're going to be fine parents one day.

Mum, I won't go if you don't want me to.

Don't be silly, love.

38:40.860 --> 38:43.250
I'm sure I'll manage.

38:43.300 --> 38:45.860
I'm not sure she will.

38:49.700 --> 38:55.140
Um, Mum, would you like to
come and stay with me and Pete?

38:55.700 --> 38:58.050
Just while Sheila's away.

38:58.100 --> 39:00.090
Oh, well,

39:00.140 --> 39:03.370
it would be lovely to
see those grandchildren.

39:03.420 --> 39:05.660
You'd be very welcome, Barbara.

39:06.980 --> 39:09.050
Come on, Pete. Chop, chop.

39:11.420 --> 39:14.410
You've got a lot of gear for a fortnight.

39:14.460 --> 39:18.170
Well, when I told Marvin
I had to change my ticket

39:18.220 --> 39:21.170
he said why don't I get an open one?

39:21.220 --> 39:23.970
Well, when are you coming back?

39:24.020 --> 39:26.890
That's the thing. I don't think I am.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.980
Oh.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.370
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:44.420 --> 39:47.540
- (It'll be all right.)
- You OK?

39:51.060 --> 39:55.210
- You told Dad?
- Darling, he wanted to be here for you.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.620
- He's not going to come
into the clinic, OK? - OK.

39:59.220 --> 40:01.260
All right, sweetheart?

40:02.860 --> 40:04.500
Matt.

40:10.580 --> 40:12.620
Should we get some coffee?

40:13.700 --> 40:17.290
- Grandma's here!
- Blimey, got more luggage than Sheila.

40:17.340 --> 40:19.770
I brought a few knick-knacks with me.

40:19.820 --> 40:23.050
- Thought it'll make it feel
more like home. - Grandma!

40:23.100 --> 40:25.090
- Oh!
- Not for us it won't.

40:25.140 --> 40:28.090
- Hi, Gran!
- Oh, my.

40:28.140 --> 40:30.530
Who is this handsome young man?

40:30.580 --> 40:33.170
- You all right?
- I'll give you a hand.

40:33.220 --> 40:35.220
Oh, thanks, love.

40:44.580 --> 40:48.850
- Karen. - I've really
screwed things up, David.

40:48.900 --> 40:51.220
It's not your fault.

40:53.940 --> 40:56.250
I've been too absorbed with work.

40:56.300 --> 40:58.290
You've had to be.

40:58.340 --> 41:00.890
I feel like I've failed.

41:00.940 --> 41:02.930
Karen.

41:02.980 --> 41:07.170
The girls could not have a better
role model. Liv's made a mistake.

41:07.220 --> 41:11.340
It's not like she's gone off the
rails, using drugs or something.

41:12.220 --> 41:15.730
She's a good kid. This
doesn't change that.

41:15.780 --> 41:18.770
- It's gonna have an impact,
though, isn't it? - Yeah.

41:18.820 --> 41:21.130
We'll both keep an eye on it.

41:21.180 --> 41:24.610
She'll be fine. She's
like you. She's strong.

41:24.660 --> 41:27.780
And she has two parents who love her.

41:36.100 --> 41:38.140
Um, I think we ought to go.

41:39.420 --> 41:41.980
- Will you come, too?
- Yes, darling.

42:00.060 --> 42:02.060
Ten weeks.

42:04.060 --> 42:06.050
Can we see it?

42:06.100 --> 42:08.490
The scan.

42:08.540 --> 42:10.650
If Olivia gives her consent.

42:10.700 --> 42:12.370
Mm-hm.

42:12.420 --> 42:14.260
Are you sure?

42:15.100 --> 42:17.100
Yeah, I want to.

42:23.580 --> 42:27.020
- I'm sorry, David.
- It's not your fault.

42:27.900 --> 42:31.210
No, but if she was my daughter,

42:31.260 --> 42:34.580
I'd hate for her to be going through this.

42:37.580 --> 42:39.220
Thanks.

42:46.780 --> 42:50.170
Do you think we're better
parents than our parents were?

42:50.220 --> 42:52.050
How do you mean?

42:52.100 --> 42:56.050
Well, you know, every
generation tries to improve

42:56.100 --> 42:59.570
on what they see as the
failings of the past.

42:59.620 --> 43:03.050
I just wonder if, you know,
maybe we've gone too far

43:03.100 --> 43:05.450
and nowadays there's less discipline.

43:05.500 --> 43:09.140
We encourage our kids to
question received wisdom.

43:10.380 --> 43:14.370
You know, maybe we should
just have strict boundaries.

43:14.420 --> 43:18.690
- Then they'd be less likely to get
into trouble. - You really think so?

43:18.740 --> 43:22.100
I don't know. I don't know.

43:26.140 --> 43:29.610
Mifepristone. It blocks
the hormone progesterone,

43:29.660 --> 43:32.770
causing the lining of the
uterus to break down.

43:32.820 --> 43:34.970
So it kills the foetus?

43:35.020 --> 43:37.300
It ends the pregnancy, yes.
