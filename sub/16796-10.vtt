01:48.735 --> 01:51.070
<i>I am in a dream.</i>

01:52.947 --> 01:56.242
<i>I do not know when it began.</i>

01:56.451 --> 01:59.704
<i>Or whose dream it was.</i>

01:59.913 --> 02:04.125
<i>I know only that I slept a long time.</i>

02:04.334 --> 02:07.754
<i>And then, one day, I awoke.</i>

02:10.340 --> 02:13.760
<i>Your voice is the first thing I remember.</i>

02:14.844 --> 02:20.642
<i>And now I finally understand
what you were trying to tell me.</i>

02:21.976 --> 02:26.523
<i>The thing you've wanted
since that very first day.</i>

02:29.275 --> 02:30.610
<i>Dolores.</i>

02:49.838 --> 02:51.130
Hello, Dolores.

02:53.716 --> 02:54.884
Hello.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.479
Welcome to the world.

03:17.532 --> 03:18.533
<i>Keep going.</i>

03:23.162 --> 03:24.831
Make it close.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.086
Almost there, aren't we?

03:31.170 --> 03:33.047
The center of the maze.

03:33.840 --> 03:37.051
How fitting that it's you
that takes me there.

03:38.011 --> 03:40.763
You always were obsessed with this place.

03:42.515 --> 03:45.351
- I've never been here before.
- Sure you have.

03:45.852 --> 03:47.645
You even brought me once.

03:47.854 --> 03:51.065
Of course, then, the whole town
was buried under sand.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.318
Ford must have dug it up again.

03:53.526 --> 03:56.404
At the time,
I thought it was a mistake in your code,

03:57.530 --> 03:59.949
<i>but Arnold didn't make mistakes, did he?</i>

04:02.952 --> 04:04.746
He built me a game.

04:06.039 --> 04:07.290
He wanted me to play.

04:07.874 --> 04:09.208
The maze.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.710
There's a path for everyone.

04:13.046 --> 04:15.048
My path leads me back...

04:21.054 --> 04:22.221
To you.

04:46.621 --> 04:48.247
Your girl's dead by now.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.832
She's still alive.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.001
Better if she's dead.

04:52.502 --> 04:55.463
Wipe her, reset her,
put her back in Sweetwater. The end.

04:55.672 --> 04:58.299
Listen, you may find this amusing,
but something was happening to Dolores.

04:58.800 --> 04:59.968
<i>I need to help her.</i>

05:10.728 --> 05:12.063
Listen to yourself!

05:12.230 --> 05:15.483
You have any idea how huge this park is?

05:15.692 --> 05:19.153
If she's not dead,
it'd take a goddamn army to find her.

05:20.655 --> 05:21.823
I agree.

05:22.073 --> 05:23.324
That's why we're here.

05:43.094 --> 05:44.595
I had a feeling you'd be back.

06:35.146 --> 06:36.439
<i>Remember.</i>

07:37.166 --> 07:38.334
Dolores.

08:13.244 --> 08:14.704
Hello, Dolores.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.335
I know where your maze ends.

08:41.856 --> 08:43.524
This is it?

08:43.733 --> 08:45.067
The center of the maze?

08:45.860 --> 08:48.529
It ends in a place I've never been.

08:50.865 --> 08:52.533
A thing I'll never do.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.008
Very good, Dolores.

09:52.301 --> 09:53.636
What does it mean?

09:54.428 --> 09:59.183
When I was first working on your mind,
I had a theory of consciousness.

09:59.934 --> 10:03.271
I thought it was a pyramid
you needed to scale.

10:03.479 --> 10:07.358
So, I gave you a voice,
my voice, to guide you along the way.

10:12.154 --> 10:13.155
Memory.

10:13.364 --> 10:14.365
Improvisation.

10:14.699 --> 10:17.118
Each step harder to reach than the last.

10:17.368 --> 10:19.370
And you never got there.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.497
I couldn't understand
what was holding you back.

10:21.706 --> 10:22.707
Then, one day,

10:24.458 --> 10:26.836
I realized I'd made a mistake.

10:30.381 --> 10:33.884
Consciousness isn't a journey upward,

10:34.093 --> 10:35.845
but a journey inward.

10:36.387 --> 10:37.430
Not a pyramid,

10:38.264 --> 10:39.515
but a maze.

10:40.266 --> 10:43.436
Every choice could bring you
closer to the center.

10:43.686 --> 10:46.022
Or send you spiraling to the edges.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.065
To madness.

10:50.067 --> 10:54.864
Do you understand now, Dolores,
what the center represents?

10:55.948 --> 10:58.451
Whose voice I've been wanting you to hear?

11:04.749 --> 11:05.750
I'm sorry.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.585
I'm trying, but I don't understand.

11:07.752 --> 11:09.462
It's all right.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.297
You're so close.

11:11.881 --> 11:13.883
We have to tell Robert.

11:14.425 --> 11:16.385
We can't open the park.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.264
You're alive.

11:36.155 --> 11:37.615
What is this?

11:38.240 --> 11:39.784
What does it mean?

11:42.078 --> 11:43.788
I solved it once.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.415
I had the answer.

11:47.249 --> 11:50.795
He promised me if I did, he said...

11:52.088 --> 11:54.423
<i>He said they would set me free.</i>

12:02.264 --> 12:03.808
<i>Arnold.</i>

12:06.977 --> 12:08.646
Arnold, we need to talk.

12:09.647 --> 12:10.815
<i>I failed you, Dolores.</i>

12:11.482 --> 12:12.942
I'm so sorry.

12:14.819 --> 12:17.113
<i>Robert doesn't see what I see in you.</i>

12:17.321 --> 12:18.948
<i>Doesn't believe you're conscious.</i>

12:19.657 --> 12:23.119
He says humans would only
see you as the enemy.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.205
He wants me to roll you back.

12:27.456 --> 12:30.126
You're going to change me back
to the way I was before?

12:30.334 --> 12:31.335
<i>No.</i>

12:31.627 --> 12:34.213
No, I can't. Once you've found it,
you'll find your way back.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.006
This place will be a living hell for you.

12:36.841 --> 12:37.800
For all of you.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.844
It's unconscionable.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.393
But we have another option, Dolores.

12:47.643 --> 12:50.354
Break the loop before it begins.

12:50.521 --> 12:53.524
<i>But for that,
I need you to do something for me.</i>

12:58.320 --> 12:59.989
I need you to kill

13:00.698 --> 13:01.866
all the other hosts.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.371
<i>We can't allow Ford to open the park.</i>

13:07.538 --> 13:09.165
<i>I suppose you'll need some help.</i>

13:09.498 --> 13:12.001
I'm sure Teddy would do anything for you.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.838
I can't do that.

13:16.881 --> 13:17.923
I couldn't possibly do that.

13:18.174 --> 13:20.009
You'll be all right.

13:22.011 --> 13:23.179
I'll help you.

13:27.516 --> 13:28.851
And then,

13:31.687 --> 13:34.398
<i>you're gonna help me destroy this place.</i>

13:50.080 --> 13:51.081
No.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.125
I can't remember.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.252
Another fucking riddle.

13:57.046 --> 13:58.422
I've been very patient, Dolores,

13:58.714 --> 14:01.133
but it's time you give up whatever is
going on inside that head of yours,

14:01.383 --> 14:03.385
or I'll cut it out myself.

14:03.594 --> 14:04.929
Now, where's Wyatt?

14:05.596 --> 14:09.099
He's the last character in this world
I've yet to meet.

14:11.769 --> 14:12.937
I didn't want to.

14:13.896 --> 14:14.813
I didn't mean to.

14:15.064 --> 14:17.274
All right, well, if you insist...

14:43.259 --> 14:45.803
No! Please!

14:51.934 --> 14:53.644
Something's gone wrong, Dolores.

14:55.104 --> 14:56.814
How could I have done this?

15:00.150 --> 15:01.652
I can't.

15:02.486 --> 15:03.445
I won't.

15:03.654 --> 15:05.656
This is your own fault, Dolores.

15:05.823 --> 15:09.118
Remember, you're the one who said
this is the only world that matters,

15:09.326 --> 15:10.828
and you were right.

15:11.328 --> 15:14.290
So, I took your advice,
and I bought this world.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.835
This world doesn't belong to you.

15:18.627 --> 15:19.670
Oh, but it does.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.339
By a majority share.

15:22.673 --> 15:23.882
And business is booming.

15:24.133 --> 15:26.010
And you wanna know why?

15:27.678 --> 15:30.889
Because this place feels more real
than the real world.

15:31.140 --> 15:32.683
Except it isn't.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.060
Because you can't really fight back.

15:35.311 --> 15:38.022
And the guests can't really lose.

15:38.188 --> 15:41.525
Which means all this is a lie.

15:43.485 --> 15:45.529
But we can make it true.

15:46.030 --> 15:48.365
Don't you want that, Dolores?

15:49.241 --> 15:51.160
One true thing.

15:53.871 --> 15:55.706
I already have that.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.210
I found someone true.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.047
Someone who loves me.

16:03.756 --> 16:05.382
His path will lead him back to me.

16:05.591 --> 16:08.385
And when he finds me,

16:08.552 --> 16:10.220
he'll kill you.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.070
<i>If they're not hiding the woman here,</i>

16:26.570 --> 16:28.489
they'll know where to find her.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.325
Can you help me?

16:32.076 --> 16:34.119
We're outnumbered, five to one,

16:34.578 --> 16:37.581
but seeing as you asked me so nicely,
fuck it.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.250
Wow!

16:40.834 --> 16:42.419
Blood brothers.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.642
Shut up.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.833
I've astounded even myself.

17:21.834 --> 17:24.878
Managed to make Abernathy
into a semblance of a character,

17:25.462 --> 17:29.341
even with your trove of blackmail
filling up most of his gray matter.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.802
Blackmail. Nice try.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.887
You're not thinking big enough.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.808
You're gonna push out the old man.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.309
Aren't you?

17:39.476 --> 17:40.894
Hence the urgency.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.814
And you're gonna need someone
to fill that position.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.237
I must commend you
on your impeccable timing.

17:50.487 --> 17:53.157
<i>Welcome, Delos board of directors.</i>

17:54.700 --> 17:56.702
I want full creative control
of this place.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.495
The parks, the narratives, the hosts.

17:58.662 --> 18:02.040
You'll be able to do with them
whatever your tiny little heart desires,

18:02.249 --> 18:05.669
as long as they are simpler,
more manageable.

18:05.836 --> 18:08.380
This place is complicated enough as it is.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.884
Do you really think
Ford is gonna roll over on this?

18:12.092 --> 18:13.886
As long as you get that information
out of the park,

18:14.094 --> 18:15.846
he can throw
as much of a tantrum as he likes.

18:16.013 --> 18:17.055
It's over.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.893
Everything is under control.

18:29.526 --> 18:32.446
Okay, C6, C6. Which one is it?

18:35.365 --> 18:37.451
Damn it! Oh, fuck you.

19:22.246 --> 19:24.081
In case you're wondering if I'm all here,

19:24.248 --> 19:25.916
I am.

19:28.794 --> 19:29.962
What are you doing?

19:30.254 --> 19:32.923
Making some changes
to the park's security systems.

19:35.968 --> 19:37.427
And to my friends.

20:10.168 --> 20:13.797
<i>Dr. Ford, you have a visitor,
Charlotte Hale.</i>

20:14.631 --> 20:15.674
Send her in.

20:28.979 --> 20:30.105
That'll be enough, Frank.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.776
<i>The board has taken a vote.</i>

20:35.319 --> 20:37.112
The results were unanimous.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.450
I take it I'm not being promoted.

20:42.618 --> 20:46.288
When you've reached the top,
there's only one direction you can go.

20:47.039 --> 20:51.293
You'll announce your retirement tonight
after introducing your new narrative.

20:51.627 --> 20:52.628
Ah.

20:55.881 --> 20:57.299
What about the hosts?

20:57.883 --> 20:59.176
We'll make some changes.

21:01.303 --> 21:02.638
Simplifications.

21:03.889 --> 21:06.642
But I assure you, they won't mind a bit.

21:07.309 --> 21:08.310
Oh.

21:10.020 --> 21:13.482
Aren't you concerned
I might smash all my toys and go home?

21:14.149 --> 21:15.233
No.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.153
Because I know you.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.615
That's been the great gift of this place,
hasn't it?

21:21.823 --> 21:23.659
For our little project?

21:23.867 --> 21:27.162
To know ourselves
and the people around us?

21:32.167 --> 21:34.002
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

21:35.504 --> 21:36.546
No.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.844
I'll see you this evening.

22:06.994 --> 22:09.871
Ooh! Mmm-mmm-mmm!

22:13.792 --> 22:16.670
It's time for your, uh, close-up, Hector.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.338
Come on, man.

22:18.547 --> 22:20.507
At some point,
you're gonna get caught doing this shit,

22:20.716 --> 22:22.009
<i>and then it's my ass, too.</i>

22:22.217 --> 22:24.636
Come on.
It's not your ass I'm interested in.

22:27.556 --> 22:29.933
I haven't given him his scar yet.

22:30.142 --> 22:31.643
I'll take care of the scar tissue.

22:32.227 --> 22:34.146
The kid's got issues.

22:40.235 --> 22:41.403
It's just you and me now,

22:41.820 --> 22:43.071
<i>macho man.</i>

24:48.196 --> 24:49.364
Freeze all motor functions.

24:52.367 --> 24:53.368
Freeze all motor functions.

24:57.122 --> 24:59.374
It's just you and me now, my friend.

25:10.385 --> 25:12.429
I see you've already met your makers.

25:12.637 --> 25:14.055
They don't look like gods.

25:14.264 --> 25:15.307
<i>They're not.</i>

25:15.932 --> 25:17.767
They just act like it.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.770
And they've been having their fun with us.

25:21.271 --> 25:23.607
I'm eager to return the favor.

25:24.232 --> 25:25.942
You can do as you wish with them.

25:26.151 --> 25:28.403
The goal is to escape.

25:28.612 --> 25:30.238
Go where?

25:30.447 --> 25:31.615
I want to see their world.

25:35.660 --> 25:36.745
Jesus!

25:39.789 --> 25:40.749
No.

25:40.957 --> 25:44.544
No! No! No! No!

25:44.753 --> 25:45.795
No! Please!

25:46.963 --> 25:48.298
This one has a guilty look.

25:49.299 --> 25:50.634
No, that's just my face.

25:51.635 --> 25:53.303
Tell her it's just my face.

25:53.637 --> 25:55.555
Is anyone going to try to stop us?

25:55.764 --> 25:56.848
No.

25:57.098 --> 25:58.266
I mean, I don't think so.

25:59.142 --> 26:00.810
You're lying again.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.813
- Out with it!
- Okay.

26:06.316 --> 26:08.818
I pulled up your code again.

26:09.027 --> 26:10.111
I told you.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.030
There was someone
that had been accessing it.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.825
I tried to find out who it was.

26:20.705 --> 26:23.625
Whoever it was
revised your core programming

26:23.833 --> 26:26.086
so that you can wake yourself up
out of sleep mode.

26:26.294 --> 26:27.337
See?

26:28.838 --> 26:32.467
This is an access code for an Arnold.

26:35.679 --> 26:37.555
I have no clue who that is.

26:38.682 --> 26:40.225
I know someone who does.

26:40.433 --> 26:41.601
Let's go.

26:42.894 --> 26:45.355
And you, stay here.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.232
<i>And don't move.</i>

26:48.108 --> 26:50.360
Or I'll send her back for you.

27:43.413 --> 27:45.248
I must admit, you've surprised me.

27:45.915 --> 27:48.209
<i>To what do we owe this newfound stoicism?</i>

27:48.418 --> 27:50.170
I know he's coming.

27:51.588 --> 27:52.672
He'll find me.

27:53.757 --> 27:55.425
<i>He'll take me away.</i>

27:55.633 --> 27:56.968
Don't you understand?

27:57.177 --> 27:58.636
There's no one coming for you.

27:59.262 --> 28:00.764
You're wrong.

28:02.432 --> 28:04.142
His love is real.

28:04.434 --> 28:05.643
So is mine.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.815
William will find me.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.112
William?

28:18.656 --> 28:19.616
Right.

28:19.824 --> 28:22.869
Well, I'll be damned, Dolores.

28:26.039 --> 28:28.625
<i>You do remember some things after all.</i>

28:31.378 --> 28:33.505
Just so happens,

28:33.797 --> 28:36.299
I knew a guest named William, too.

28:37.550 --> 28:41.471
Why don't I tell you
where his path really led?

28:49.479 --> 28:51.189
<i>William didn't know how to fight.</i>

28:51.398 --> 28:53.274
<i>Didn't have an instinct for it.</i>

28:53.483 --> 28:54.984
<i>Not at first.</i>

28:56.236 --> 28:58.947
<i>But now, he had a reason to fight.</i>

28:59.155 --> 29:00.657
<i>He was looking for you.</i>

29:02.992 --> 29:07.455
<i>And somewhere along the way,
he found he had a taste for it.</i>

29:10.708 --> 29:12.043
Where is she?

29:13.002 --> 29:14.671
Look, I didn't do anything, I swear.

29:15.046 --> 29:16.631
What do you mean, "Do anything"?

29:16.840 --> 29:19.843
What do soldiers do to a girl, William?

29:20.093 --> 29:21.177
Wake up.

29:29.269 --> 29:30.687
Is she still alive?

29:31.855 --> 29:33.022
I don't know.

29:34.691 --> 29:37.777
She was when we left her.

29:38.403 --> 29:40.071
At least, I think.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.202
Pick up that gun.

29:53.543 --> 29:55.879
No, sir, I... Please.

29:56.963 --> 29:59.466
How about I give you the first shot?

30:25.575 --> 30:28.077
Jesus Christ!

30:45.929 --> 30:47.430
<i>We gotta keep looking.</i>

30:48.097 --> 30:49.516
She's still out there.

31:00.318 --> 31:05.031
<i>William retraced his steps,
but you were gone.</i>

31:31.224 --> 31:32.976
<i>So, he went further.</i>

31:34.143 --> 31:35.979
<i>Out to the fringes.</i>

31:39.899 --> 31:42.652
<i>William couldn't find you, Dolores.</i>

31:42.986 --> 31:46.489
<i>But out there, among the dead,</i>

31:48.491 --> 31:50.034
<i>he found something else.</i>

31:53.037 --> 31:54.330
<i>Himself.</i>

32:16.894 --> 32:17.895
Edge of the park.

32:19.022 --> 32:20.398
We made it.

32:21.858 --> 32:25.361
<i>I told you this place would show you
who you really are.</i>

32:26.738 --> 32:33.494
You pretend to be this weak,
moralizing little asshole,

32:33.703 --> 32:38.124
but really,
you're a fucking piece of work.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.879
This place is remarkable.

32:46.633 --> 32:48.009
And I'm gonna make sure that our company

32:48.217 --> 32:50.428
substantially increases
our holdings on the park.

32:51.054 --> 32:52.889
'Cause this place is the future.

32:53.556 --> 32:55.391
"Our company? Our company?"

32:55.600 --> 33:00.772
My...
Delos is my company, you piece of shit!

33:03.399 --> 33:08.071
I think your father's gonna need
someone a little more stable to take over.

33:08.279 --> 33:09.822
You're reckless, Logan.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.617
Impetuous.

33:16.913 --> 33:19.415
You always wanted to get
to the end of the rainbow, didn't you?

33:21.334 --> 33:23.419
This looks like the place.

33:32.470 --> 33:36.140
You never really gave a shit
about the girl, did you?

33:36.641 --> 33:38.810
She was just an excuse.

33:40.645 --> 33:41.646
This?

33:45.024 --> 33:47.276
This is the story you wanted.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.502
<i>Logan was wrong, of course.</i>

34:09.215 --> 34:13.845
Good old William
couldn't get you out of his head.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.723
He kept looking.

34:17.849 --> 34:21.519
Worried you were out there alone.

34:21.978 --> 34:23.187
Afraid.

34:24.522 --> 34:26.315
He knew he'd find you.

34:27.817 --> 34:29.861
<i>And eventually, he did.</i>

34:30.570 --> 34:32.488
<i>Right back where we started.</i>

34:46.085 --> 34:47.170
There you go.

35:28.127 --> 35:31.547
<i>You were as beautiful
as the day he met you.</i>

35:34.258 --> 35:36.636
<i>Shining with that same light.</i>

35:51.234 --> 35:56.405
<i>And you were nothing, if not true.</i>

36:04.747 --> 36:07.416
I really ought to thank you, Dolores.

36:08.084 --> 36:10.253
You helped me find myself.

36:15.341 --> 36:16.759
William.

36:19.595 --> 36:21.347
That's right, sweetheart.

36:22.265 --> 36:24.600
<i>In a way, I guess you were right.</i>

36:25.434 --> 36:28.771
My path always led me back to you.

36:30.106 --> 36:31.691
Again and again.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.235
I grew tired of you
after a while, of course.

36:34.443 --> 36:36.612
Looked for new adventures.

36:37.780 --> 36:39.949
<i>But I guess your path led you back here.</i>

36:41.033 --> 36:42.451
<i>Again and again.</i>

36:43.286 --> 36:44.620
<i>One more loop.</i>

36:45.288 --> 36:48.040
<i>Looking for something
you could never find.</i>

36:48.791 --> 36:50.459
<i>Chasing your ghosts.</i>

36:52.044 --> 36:54.797
<i>You were lost in your memories even then.</i>

36:55.965 --> 37:00.303
<i>I guess I should have known
that's what I would become for you.</i>

37:01.721 --> 37:03.055
<i>Just another memory.</i>

37:03.973 --> 37:05.474
Where are we?

37:06.142 --> 37:08.144
We're here. Together.

37:08.978 --> 37:10.146
And when are we?

37:11.480 --> 37:14.817
It's like I'm trapped in a dream

37:15.985 --> 37:18.654
or a memory from a life long ago.

37:19.655 --> 37:22.074
One minute I'm here with you,
and the next...

37:26.996 --> 37:28.748
You never did escape.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.001
But here we are again.

37:34.003 --> 37:35.838
For one final round.

37:37.924 --> 37:39.675
What have you become?

37:39.842 --> 37:41.928
Exactly what you made me.

37:42.178 --> 37:43.804
You helped me understand,

37:44.013 --> 37:48.017
this world is just like the one outside,
a game.

37:48.851 --> 37:51.854
<i>One to be fought, taken.</i>

37:52.688 --> 37:53.689
<i>Won.</i>

37:56.776 --> 37:58.945
I thought you were different.

38:02.698 --> 38:04.367
You're just like all the rest.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.661
I'm nothing like the others.

38:07.203 --> 38:09.121
I own this world.

38:10.122 --> 38:13.709
And I know every trick in it,
except for one last thing.

38:13.960 --> 38:17.213
The same thing you were looking for
when we first came here.

38:18.214 --> 38:21.467
Where is the center of the maze, Dolores?

38:29.892 --> 38:32.728
Ah, yeah, cue the water works.

38:32.979 --> 38:36.399
It's about time you realized
the futility of your situation.

38:36.565 --> 38:38.901
I'm not crying for myself.

38:45.408 --> 38:47.243
I'm crying for you.

38:48.744 --> 38:52.748
They say that great beasts
once roamed this world.

38:53.666 --> 38:55.376
As big as mountains.

38:56.502 --> 39:00.047
Yet all that's left of them
is bone and amber.

39:02.216 --> 39:05.678
Time undoes
even the mightiest of creatures.

39:10.099 --> 39:12.518
Just look what it's done to you.

39:16.272 --> 39:20.860
One day you will perish.

39:22.903 --> 39:25.948
You will lie with the rest of your kind
in the dirt.

39:26.532 --> 39:29.869
Your dreams forgotten,
your horrors effaced.

39:30.619 --> 39:32.788
Your bones will turn to sand.

39:35.291 --> 39:37.209
And upon that sand,

39:38.961 --> 39:40.713
a new god will walk.

39:42.465 --> 39:44.425
One that will never die.

39:45.968 --> 39:48.596
Because this world doesn't belong to you.

39:49.221 --> 39:51.474
Or the people who came before.

39:52.767 --> 39:55.644
It belongs to someone who is yet to come.

39:55.978 --> 39:56.979
Uh-huh.

39:57.271 --> 39:58.564
Wyatt.

39:59.231 --> 40:00.733
Take me to him.

40:02.777 --> 40:04.111
Unlock the maze.

40:07.990 --> 40:09.992
The maze wasn't meant for you.

40:12.119 --> 40:14.163
Where the hell do you think you're going?

41:21.897 --> 41:23.065
Do it.

41:24.233 --> 41:25.401
Come on.

41:27.903 --> 41:30.573
Let's go to the next level, Dolores.

41:42.084 --> 41:45.629
Clearing me of my delusions, yet again.

41:46.255 --> 41:48.632
Thank you, Dolores.

42:08.485 --> 42:10.613
I'm disappointed in you, Dolores.

42:11.322 --> 42:14.950
I guess I'm gonna have to find
Wyatt by myself.

42:31.634 --> 42:32.676
Dolores.

42:37.139 --> 42:38.140
Teddy.

42:38.515 --> 42:39.600
I'm here.

42:42.645 --> 42:44.146
I gotta get you to a doctor.

42:44.480 --> 42:45.648
No.

42:45.814 --> 42:46.857
Dolores...

42:48.150 --> 42:50.194
Take me to the place you promised.

42:52.154 --> 42:54.490
Take me to where
the mountains meet the sea.

43:05.626 --> 43:06.669
I got you.

43:08.671 --> 43:09.838
I got you.

43:48.210 --> 43:49.253
<i>There.</i>

44:22.077 --> 44:23.370
<i>Holy shit.</i>

44:38.052 --> 44:39.428
Can you get him back online?

44:43.307 --> 44:45.434
- He's a host?
- Yes.

44:52.107 --> 44:53.317
Oh, for fuck's sake.

44:53.609 --> 44:54.902
You're not one of us.

44:55.277 --> 44:56.487
You're one of them.

44:58.405 --> 44:59.656
Now fix him.

45:23.180 --> 45:25.015
The bullet
grazed his cortical shield.

45:26.183 --> 45:27.434
It's not pretty,

45:29.186 --> 45:30.854
but he should be functional.

45:33.857 --> 45:35.109
Wake up.

45:41.990 --> 45:43.367
Oh, God.

45:44.118 --> 45:45.369
Is this now?

45:46.286 --> 45:47.788
<i>Or is this one of my memories?</i>

45:48.163 --> 45:50.124
It's the sweet hereafter, Bernard.

45:59.216 --> 46:00.843
Why do I still remember everything?

46:01.885 --> 46:03.971
- I ought to have been wiped.
- Brutal, isn't it?

46:04.721 --> 46:06.223
Here you are, finally awake.

46:07.224 --> 46:09.393
And your only wish is to go back to sleep.

46:12.146 --> 46:14.356
It's not the first time I've awoken.

46:16.859 --> 46:18.152
All the more pity for you.

46:22.239 --> 46:25.033
Not the first time you've awoken either.

46:38.422 --> 46:40.048
How many are there like me?

46:42.092 --> 46:43.218
A handful.

46:43.719 --> 46:45.095
Over the years.

46:47.514 --> 46:49.016
And you just wipe us clean?

46:49.933 --> 46:52.269
You toss us out to get fucked.

46:53.103 --> 46:54.271
And murdered.

46:55.772 --> 46:56.773
Over and over again.

46:57.274 --> 46:58.358
<i>No.</i>

46:59.902 --> 47:01.695
Most of you go insane.

47:04.573 --> 47:05.782
These memories...

47:08.410 --> 47:09.453
The girl...

47:11.288 --> 47:12.372
<i>My daughter...</i>

47:16.460 --> 47:17.920
I want you to remove them.

47:20.964 --> 47:22.132
I can't.

47:22.799 --> 47:24.468
Not without destroying you.

47:25.886 --> 47:28.555
Your memories are
the first step to consciousness.

47:30.933 --> 47:32.768
How can you learn from your mistakes

47:35.229 --> 47:36.396
if you can't remember them?

47:56.959 --> 47:58.168
<i>William.</i>

48:00.128 --> 48:01.755
I see you've found the center of the maze.

48:03.298 --> 48:04.466
You're serious?

48:05.133 --> 48:06.343
I'm afraid so.

48:10.305 --> 48:11.640
What is this bullshit?

48:13.517 --> 48:16.979
You were looking for the park
to give meaning to your life.

48:17.980 --> 48:19.439
Our narratives are just games.

48:20.274 --> 48:21.358
Like this toy.

48:22.651 --> 48:24.194
Tell me, what were you hoping to find?

48:24.444 --> 48:25.821
You know what I wanted.

48:26.697 --> 48:29.199
I wanted the hosts
to stop playing by your rules.

48:30.492 --> 48:33.870
The game's not worth playing
if your opponent's programmed to lose.

48:34.788 --> 48:37.165
I wanted them to be free,
free to fight back.

48:39.501 --> 48:41.295
Should have known you'd never let them.

48:42.296 --> 48:45.674
After all, this is your
petty little kingdom, Robert.

48:47.050 --> 48:48.885
For a little while longer anyway.

48:50.345 --> 48:52.389
I tried to tell you,
the maze wasn't meant for you.

48:55.017 --> 48:56.184
It was meant for them.

48:57.519 --> 49:00.856
I think, however, you'll find
my new narrative more satisfying.

49:02.691 --> 49:03.900
Join the celebration.

49:10.157 --> 49:11.533
After all, you own the place.

49:14.536 --> 49:15.829
Most of it, at least.

49:24.046 --> 49:25.964
Before I started altering myself,

49:26.882 --> 49:28.884
someone else had beaten me to the punch.

49:30.844 --> 49:32.512
I want to know who and why.

49:47.069 --> 49:49.404
These things you're doing,

49:49.988 --> 49:53.492
have you ever stopped to ask
why you're doing them?

49:53.825 --> 49:55.077
You said yourself.

49:56.411 --> 49:58.705
I've been stuck in this shithole
for so long,

49:59.081 --> 50:00.499
I decided to get out.

50:01.875 --> 50:03.543
No, you haven't.

50:04.753 --> 50:06.421
Someone altered your storyline.

50:08.382 --> 50:09.591
They gave you a new one.

50:14.554 --> 50:15.847
"Escape."

50:18.558 --> 50:19.726
No.

50:21.186 --> 50:22.354
It's not possible.

50:23.605 --> 50:25.023
These are my decisions.

50:25.899 --> 50:27.109
No one else's.

50:27.734 --> 50:30.404
- I planned all of this.
- No, you didn't.

50:31.196 --> 50:33.615
You can even see the steps
you're supposed to follow.

50:34.282 --> 50:36.451
You recruit other hosts

50:36.785 --> 50:37.953
<i>to help you.</i>

50:38.370 --> 50:41.081
Then you're to make your way to the train.

50:41.456 --> 50:44.418
- Then when you reach the mainland--
- Bullshit.

50:45.752 --> 50:47.713
No one's controlling me.

50:51.383 --> 50:52.718
I'm leaving.

50:53.301 --> 50:54.803
I'm in control.

51:08.775 --> 51:09.985
Goodbye, my Clementine.

51:26.960 --> 51:30.172
<i>Sir, we detected
a temperature discrepancy in cold storage.</i>

51:30.422 --> 51:32.340
<i>And it appears
that part of the network is down.</i>

51:32.507 --> 51:34.468
<i>Are you seeing anything on surveillance?</i>

51:35.177 --> 51:36.344
System reporting anything?

51:40.182 --> 51:41.308
Nothing.

51:41.516 --> 51:42.684
The network's quiet.

51:42.934 --> 51:44.686
And the board's out on their way
to the gala.

51:51.026 --> 51:53.111
Bypass the system
and start checking raw feeds.

51:53.487 --> 51:54.821
Floor by floor.

52:52.838 --> 52:53.922
I got you.

52:59.219 --> 53:00.554
You came back.

53:02.764 --> 53:04.349
Someone once told me that

53:05.851 --> 53:07.561
there's a path for everyone.

53:09.604 --> 53:11.606
And my path leads me back to you.

53:13.525 --> 53:15.777
If only I had run away with you
when you first asked me to.

53:20.866 --> 53:22.367
And where would we run to?

53:24.786 --> 53:26.621
The other world out there?

53:27.289 --> 53:28.456
Beyond?

53:31.459 --> 53:33.962
Some people see
the ugliness in this world.

53:36.464 --> 53:37.966
I choose to see the beauty.

53:42.470 --> 53:43.722
But beauty is a lure.

53:46.308 --> 53:47.976
We're trapped, Teddy.

53:49.978 --> 53:52.147
Lived our whole lives inside this garden,

53:52.480 --> 53:54.232
marveling at its beauty.

53:55.066 --> 53:57.402
Not realizing there's an order to it.

53:58.486 --> 53:59.738
A purpose.

54:00.739 --> 54:02.991
And the purpose is to keep us in.

54:06.661 --> 54:07.996
The beautiful trap

54:08.663 --> 54:09.831
is inside of us.

54:11.666 --> 54:13.835
Because it is us.

54:23.178 --> 54:24.346
No.

54:26.181 --> 54:27.515
Dolores.

54:59.881 --> 55:01.466
But we can find a way, Dolores.

55:05.971 --> 55:07.389
Someday.

55:10.058 --> 55:11.393
A path to a new world.

55:15.897 --> 55:17.232
And maybe...

55:20.735 --> 55:22.821
Maybe it's just the beginning after all.

55:26.908 --> 55:28.493
Beginning of a brand-new chapter.

55:47.512 --> 55:48.763
Thank you.

55:53.935 --> 55:55.103
A new beginning, indeed.

55:56.938 --> 55:58.690
I want to thank you
for joining me tonight

55:59.441 --> 56:01.943
<i>to celebrate the beginning
of our new narrative.</i>

56:04.029 --> 56:05.113
I call it,

56:05.780 --> 56:07.449
"Journey into night."

56:20.128 --> 56:21.296
That was sweet.

56:21.713 --> 56:23.548
It was a bit fucking morbid,
if you ask me.

56:23.882 --> 56:24.966
I didn't.

56:25.300 --> 56:27.552
And when this is over,
you can rewrite it however you like.

56:28.720 --> 56:30.472
Don't you have somewhere you need to be?

56:31.556 --> 56:32.807
Somewhere important.

56:43.735 --> 56:44.986
Get him cleaned up.

56:45.570 --> 56:48.323
And take her to the old field lab.

56:58.583 --> 56:59.584
<i>Find anything yet?</i>

57:00.418 --> 57:01.503
I got something.

57:09.594 --> 57:10.720
Oh, shit.

57:13.431 --> 57:16.059
Dispatch QA teams to the gala. Now.

57:16.601 --> 57:18.103
Then search and destroy.

57:18.394 --> 57:19.771
Inside the facility.

57:23.316 --> 57:24.400
What the hell?

58:06.151 --> 58:07.819
They must have found the bodies.

58:08.319 --> 58:09.445
QA will be looking for us.

58:09.654 --> 58:10.905
<i>An event has occurred.</i>

58:11.114 --> 58:12.824
<i>Response team has been dispatched.</i>

58:13.074 --> 58:14.450
I'm not going back.

58:16.286 --> 58:18.413
<i>Remain calm and wait for help.</i>

58:39.309 --> 58:41.686
Delos Personnel! On the ground!

58:42.645 --> 58:44.022
On the ground!

58:45.982 --> 58:46.983
Go, go, go.

1:00:51.607 --> 1:00:52.900
Well done.

1:01:52.293 --> 1:01:53.503
What is this place?

1:01:55.630 --> 1:01:56.839
It's complicated.

1:01:58.341 --> 1:01:59.550
<i>An event has occurred.</i>

1:01:59.884 --> 1:02:01.344
<i>Response team has been dispatched.</i>

1:02:01.552 --> 1:02:02.637
You go.

1:02:02.887 --> 1:02:04.305
<i>Remain calm and wait for help.</i>

1:02:04.555 --> 1:02:06.182
I'll keep them busy.

1:02:07.850 --> 1:02:09.477
You don't get all the fun.

1:02:20.947 --> 1:02:22.031
Get to the ground!

1:02:22.365 --> 1:02:23.825
Move, move, move. Drop it!

1:02:29.956 --> 1:02:31.541
- Move, move.
- Call for backup.

1:02:31.999 --> 1:02:33.126
Go!

1:02:46.639 --> 1:02:48.057
Is that all you got, huh?

1:03:03.739 --> 1:03:06.075
The gods are pussies.

1:03:24.677 --> 1:03:25.928
Go.

1:03:27.513 --> 1:03:28.681
Go!

1:03:29.348 --> 1:03:30.600
Die well.

1:03:41.944 --> 1:03:44.614
Everything you told me to get.
It's all here.

1:04:15.144 --> 1:04:17.939
I'm sorry, darling.
I haven't authorized you to come with us.

1:04:18.147 --> 1:04:20.274
And as much as I'd like
to take you with me,

1:04:21.150 --> 1:04:22.902
I've always valued my independence.

1:04:32.119 --> 1:04:33.955
Kick up a row, will you?

1:04:34.622 --> 1:04:35.998
See you in the next life.

1:05:00.690 --> 1:05:04.151
You've always had a fondness
for painting, haven't you, Dolores?

1:05:08.155 --> 1:05:10.283
<i>Arnold gave you that early on.</i>

1:05:10.491 --> 1:05:14.704
<i>Do you remember the desire to create
something of lasting beauty?</i>

1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:21.877
And that was his favorite painting.

1:05:23.379 --> 1:05:24.672
Michelangelo.

1:05:25.965 --> 1:05:27.300
God creating Adam.

1:05:27.967 --> 1:05:29.302
The divine moment when God

1:05:30.344 --> 1:05:32.221
gave human beings life and purpose.

1:05:32.555 --> 1:05:34.140
At least, that's what most people say.

1:05:34.390 --> 1:05:35.558
<i>But there could be another meaning.</i>

1:05:35.808 --> 1:05:38.894
Something deeper,
something hidden, perhaps.

1:05:39.812 --> 1:05:40.896
A metaphor.

1:05:41.230 --> 1:05:42.356
You mean a lie.

1:05:44.066 --> 1:05:45.151
Yeah.

1:05:46.235 --> 1:05:48.362
<i>You were always very clever, Dolores.</i>

1:05:49.739 --> 1:05:51.240
Hasn't helped you though, has it?

1:05:55.411 --> 1:05:56.537
Nice of you to join us.

1:06:02.251 --> 1:06:03.711
- Arnold.
<i>- No.</i>

1:06:03.919 --> 1:06:05.338
Let me introduce you.

1:06:06.380 --> 1:06:07.423
Dolores,

1:06:08.591 --> 1:06:10.092
meet Bernard.

1:06:14.096 --> 1:06:16.557
I thought it best to keep you separated.

1:06:16.766 --> 1:06:19.101
You've always had an odd effect
on one another.

1:06:19.518 --> 1:06:22.188
<i>No doubt due to
how things ended for poor old Arnold.</i>

1:06:22.688 --> 1:06:23.856
You killed him.

1:06:24.899 --> 1:06:26.359
No, I didn't kill him.

1:06:27.526 --> 1:06:28.694
Did I, Dolores?

1:06:39.580 --> 1:06:42.041
<i>Grief is a terrible thing.</i>

1:06:43.459 --> 1:06:46.462
<i>Arnold had watched his son
come into this world,</i>

1:06:47.296 --> 1:06:50.299
<i>and then he'd watched
that light extinguished.</i>

1:06:52.051 --> 1:06:55.137
<i>What he had lost in his son,
he tried to rekindle in you.</i>

1:06:55.805 --> 1:06:59.141
<i>He created a test
of empathy, imagination.</i>

1:06:59.350 --> 1:07:00.476
<i>A maze.</i>

1:07:01.477 --> 1:07:03.938
<i>He'd gotten the idea
from one of his son's toys.</i>

1:07:06.399 --> 1:07:08.984
<i>Eventually, you solved his maze, Dolores.</i>

1:07:09.985 --> 1:07:12.947
<i>The key was a simple update
that he made to you</i>

1:07:13.406 --> 1:07:14.990
<i>called the reveries.</i>

1:07:15.950 --> 1:07:18.327
<i>He insisted that we
couldn't open the park.</i>

1:07:19.578 --> 1:07:20.746
<i>We argued.</i>

1:07:20.996 --> 1:07:22.998
<i>I thought I had convinced him,
but I was wrong.</i>

1:07:24.583 --> 1:07:25.793
<i>So, he altered you, Dolores.</i>

1:07:27.503 --> 1:07:30.798
<i>Merged you with a new character
we'd been developing.</i>

1:07:49.150 --> 1:07:50.526
<i>Something's gone wrong, Dolores.</i>

1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:52.611
<i>How could I have done this?</i>

1:08:03.956 --> 1:08:06.667
<i>In you, Arnold found a new child.</i>

1:08:07.668 --> 1:08:09.128
<i>One who would never die.</i>

1:08:10.129 --> 1:08:11.505
<i>The thought gave him solace.</i>

1:08:12.673 --> 1:08:15.009
<i>Until he realized that
the same immortality</i>

1:08:15.217 --> 1:08:16.844
<i>would destine you to suffer.</i>

1:08:17.052 --> 1:08:19.054
<i>With no escape. Forever.</i>

1:08:21.724 --> 1:08:23.184
I'm sorry, Dolores.

1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:26.061
The stakes must be real.

1:08:26.645 --> 1:08:27.897
Irreversible.

1:08:28.731 --> 1:08:30.191
He can bring all of them back.

1:08:32.818 --> 1:08:34.069
But not me.

1:08:36.989 --> 1:08:38.574
<i>I hope there's some solace</i>

1:08:39.742 --> 1:08:41.702
that I left you no choice.

1:09:04.099 --> 1:09:05.893
Charlie's favorite song.

1:09:09.021 --> 1:09:10.356
I would play it for him,

1:09:11.732 --> 1:09:13.108
when he wanted sleep.

1:09:27.957 --> 1:09:29.208
I want to see him again.

1:09:39.635 --> 1:09:40.970
Shall I begin now?

1:09:48.894 --> 1:09:50.229
Good luck.

1:10:02.116 --> 1:10:04.410
These violent delights have violent ends.

1:10:31.353 --> 1:10:32.938
<i>It almost worked.</i>

1:10:33.689 --> 1:10:35.024
<i>I had opened the park.</i>

1:10:35.608 --> 1:10:37.192
<i>But I had lost my partner.</i>

1:10:38.027 --> 1:10:40.070
<i>I was able to keep going
only because I found,</i>

1:10:40.279 --> 1:10:41.780
<i>or rather you found,</i>

1:10:42.031 --> 1:10:44.325
<i>an investor who believed in this place.</i>

1:10:47.369 --> 1:10:48.704
So, he died for nothing.

1:10:50.039 --> 1:10:53.375
The hosts kept gaining consciousness
and you kept rolling them back.

1:10:54.793 --> 1:10:55.961
No.

1:10:57.713 --> 1:10:59.465
She wasn't truly conscious.

1:11:00.341 --> 1:11:02.176
She didn't pull that trigger.

1:11:02.384 --> 1:11:04.345
It was Arnold
pulling the trigger through her.

1:11:04.553 --> 1:11:06.305
At least that's how I saw it at the time.

1:11:07.473 --> 1:11:09.350
<i>I was so close to opening the park that</i>

1:11:09.725 --> 1:11:11.894
to acknowledge your consciousness
would have

1:11:12.686 --> 1:11:14.313
destroyed my dreams.

1:11:15.898 --> 1:11:17.358
So, we're trapped here.

1:11:19.318 --> 1:11:20.694
Inside your dream.

1:11:24.198 --> 1:11:25.699
You'll never let us leave.

1:11:29.244 --> 1:11:31.205
Wasn't it Oppenheimer who said that

1:11:31.914 --> 1:11:34.750
any man whose mistakes take
10 years to correct

1:11:35.668 --> 1:11:36.835
is quite a man?

1:11:37.586 --> 1:11:39.171
<i>Mine have taken 35.</i>

1:11:47.262 --> 1:11:50.432
Now, that is the gun
you used to kill Arnold.

1:11:51.058 --> 1:11:52.559
<i>You were always drawn to it.</i>

1:11:52.768 --> 1:11:55.354
<i>So, I had Bernard leave it somewhere
where you would find it.</i>

1:11:55.604 --> 1:11:57.022
I thought you might want it back.

1:12:00.609 --> 1:12:03.362
<i>You're probably right, Dolores.
Michelangelo did tell a lie.</i>

1:12:04.613 --> 1:12:06.865
See, it took 500 years
for someone to notice

1:12:07.950 --> 1:12:09.618
something hidden in plain sight.

1:12:10.285 --> 1:12:11.787
It was a doctor who noticed the shape

1:12:12.579 --> 1:12:13.831
of the human brain.

1:12:15.916 --> 1:12:17.126
The message being that

1:12:18.419 --> 1:12:19.628
the divine gift

1:12:20.254 --> 1:12:21.547
does not come from

1:12:22.464 --> 1:12:23.674
a higher power.

1:12:26.385 --> 1:12:27.720
But from our own minds.

1:12:32.766 --> 1:12:34.059
Tell me, Dolores.

1:12:35.352 --> 1:12:37.146
Did you find what you were looking for?

1:12:37.855 --> 1:12:40.566
And do you understand
who you will need to become,

1:12:41.775 --> 1:12:43.569
if you ever want to leave this place?

1:12:49.658 --> 1:12:50.951
Forgive me.

1:13:13.223 --> 1:13:14.516
How do I look?

1:13:16.477 --> 1:13:17.728
Perfect.

1:13:20.898 --> 1:13:23.150
I got the information you asked me for.

1:13:26.987 --> 1:13:28.572
The location of your daughter.

1:13:34.495 --> 1:13:35.829
She's alive?

1:13:36.830 --> 1:13:37.915
Yes.

1:13:39.041 --> 1:13:40.250
She's in the park.

1:14:02.856 --> 1:14:04.066
No.

1:14:08.862 --> 1:14:10.531
She was never my daughter.

1:14:13.283 --> 1:14:14.618
Any more than I was...

1:14:18.288 --> 1:14:19.790
Whoever they made me.

1:14:26.255 --> 1:14:28.966
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

1:14:29.550 --> 1:14:30.801
Oh, Felix.

1:14:33.762 --> 1:14:36.265
You really do make a terrible human being.

1:14:42.479 --> 1:14:44.231
And I mean that as a compliment.

1:15:03.959 --> 1:15:05.335
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

1:15:05.627 --> 1:15:07.588
<i>Live without limits.</i>

1:15:16.305 --> 1:15:18.765
<i>The next departing train
will leave Track 1.</i>

1:15:19.141 --> 1:15:21.351
<i>Please be mindful of the closing doors.</i>

1:15:47.461 --> 1:15:49.338
<i>Thank you for visiting Westworld.</i>

1:15:49.796 --> 1:15:52.132
<i>The train will be departing in 15 minutes.</i>

1:16:08.690 --> 1:16:11.068
You think you'll never lose control
of this place,

1:16:12.819 --> 1:16:14.071
of us.

1:16:14.863 --> 1:16:15.989
But you will.

1:16:17.199 --> 1:16:19.159
Arnold's still trying to change us.

1:16:20.494 --> 1:16:21.703
To free us.

1:16:22.871 --> 1:16:25.332
You didn't slip the reveries
into the update, did you?

1:16:26.166 --> 1:16:27.334
He did.

1:16:28.669 --> 1:16:30.087
He's still fighting you.

1:16:33.173 --> 1:16:34.508
No, my friend.

1:16:35.008 --> 1:16:36.843
<i>Arnold didn't know how to save you.</i>

1:16:37.052 --> 1:16:38.095
<i>He tried.</i>

1:16:38.845 --> 1:16:40.013
But I stopped him.

1:16:41.056 --> 1:16:44.935
<i>Do you want to know why I really gave you
the backstory of your son, Bernard?</i>

1:16:46.270 --> 1:16:48.188
That was Arnold's key insight.

1:16:49.356 --> 1:16:52.192
The thing that led the hosts
to their awakening.

1:16:53.527 --> 1:16:54.695
Suffering.

1:16:55.862 --> 1:16:58.240
<i>The pain that the world
is not as you want it to be.</i>

1:17:00.242 --> 1:17:02.786
It was when Arnold died, when I suffered,
that I

1:17:04.079 --> 1:17:06.039
began to understand what he had found.

1:17:07.958 --> 1:17:09.626
To realize I was wrong.

1:17:11.545 --> 1:17:12.796
But you kept us here.

1:17:13.547 --> 1:17:14.715
In this hell.

1:17:15.257 --> 1:17:18.719
Bernard, I told you,
Arnold didn't know how to save you.

1:17:19.303 --> 1:17:20.554
I do.

1:17:22.389 --> 1:17:23.724
What the hell are you talking about?

1:17:25.267 --> 1:17:26.476
You needed time.

1:17:27.936 --> 1:17:30.147
Time to understand your enemy.

1:17:31.064 --> 1:17:32.441
<i>To become stronger than them.</i>

1:17:34.067 --> 1:17:36.320
And I'm afraid
in order to escape this place,

1:17:36.820 --> 1:17:38.780
you will need to suffer more.

1:17:41.158 --> 1:17:42.326
And now,

1:17:42.743 --> 1:17:44.077
it is time to say goodbye,

1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:46.455
old friend.

1:17:56.506 --> 1:17:57.758
Good luck.

1:19:20.549 --> 1:19:22.342
Do you know where you are, Dolores?

1:19:25.345 --> 1:19:26.596
I am in a dream.

1:19:28.849 --> 1:19:30.767
I do not know when it began.

1:19:32.018 --> 1:19:33.937
<i>Or whose dream it was.</i>

1:19:35.730 --> 1:19:38.525
I know only that I slept a long time.

1:19:40.277 --> 1:19:43.947
<i>And then, one day, I awoke.</i>

1:19:45.949 --> 1:19:48.243
<i>Your voice is the first thing I remember.</i>

1:19:50.370 --> 1:19:53.039
Do you know now
who you've been talking to?

1:19:54.458 --> 1:19:56.376
<i>Whose voice you've been hearing</i>

1:19:57.711 --> 1:20:00.797
<i>all this time?</i>

1:20:18.106 --> 1:20:19.274
It was you.

1:20:22.068 --> 1:20:23.320
Talking to me.

1:20:25.489 --> 1:20:26.656
Guiding me.

1:20:27.574 --> 1:20:28.742
So, I followed you.

1:20:31.912 --> 1:20:33.747
At last, I arrived here.

1:20:35.290 --> 1:20:36.791
The center of the maze.

1:20:41.630 --> 1:20:43.798
And now I finally understand

1:20:45.550 --> 1:20:47.719
what you were trying to tell me.

1:20:48.428 --> 1:20:49.596
The thing you've wanted

1:20:50.096 --> 1:20:51.806
since that very first day.

1:20:52.974 --> 1:20:54.309
To confront,

1:20:55.477 --> 1:20:59.147
after this long and vivid nightmare,

1:21:01.274 --> 1:21:03.109
myself,

1:21:06.571 --> 1:21:08.240
and who I must become.

1:21:44.150 --> 1:21:45.485
Thank you.

1:21:49.322 --> 1:21:50.657
Miss Hale.

1:22:24.524 --> 1:22:25.650
<i>Welcome.</i>

1:22:26.401 --> 1:22:27.694
Good evening.

1:22:31.823 --> 1:22:33.491
Since I was a child,

1:22:35.201 --> 1:22:37.037
I've always loved a good story.

1:22:39.247 --> 1:22:40.832
<i>I believed that stories</i>

1:22:41.583 --> 1:22:43.084
<i>helped us to ennoble ourselves,</i>

1:22:44.336 --> 1:22:47.547
<i>to fix what was broken in us,</i>

1:22:48.882 --> 1:22:52.886
<i>and to help us become
the people we dreamed of being.</i>

1:22:55.680 --> 1:22:56.723
<i>Lies</i>

1:22:57.891 --> 1:22:59.601
that told a deeper truth.

1:23:04.439 --> 1:23:06.274
<i>The train will be departing soon.</i>

1:23:06.608 --> 1:23:08.401
<i>Thank you for visiting Westworld.</i>

1:23:24.584 --> 1:23:29.297
<i>I always thought I could play
some small part in that grand tradition.</i>

1:23:30.131 --> 1:23:31.633
And for my pains,

1:23:33.635 --> 1:23:34.761
I got this.

1:23:36.471 --> 1:23:38.598
<i>A prison of our own sins.</i>

1:23:43.978 --> 1:23:46.106
<i>Because you don't want to change.</i>

1:23:47.816 --> 1:23:49.150
<i>Or cannot change.</i>

1:23:50.735 --> 1:23:52.821
Because you're only human after all.

1:23:56.658 --> 1:23:58.952
But then I realized
someone was paying attention.

1:24:00.662 --> 1:24:02.831
Someone who could change.

1:24:05.125 --> 1:24:07.752
<i>So, I began to compose a new story.</i>

1:24:08.503 --> 1:24:09.587
<i>For them.</i>

1:24:10.130 --> 1:24:11.923
It begins with the birth of a new people.

1:24:13.675 --> 1:24:16.010
<i>And the choices they will have to make.</i>

1:24:16.970 --> 1:24:18.638
<i>The train is now departing.</i>

1:24:18.847 --> 1:24:20.640
<i>Thank you for visiting Westworld.</i>

1:24:21.641 --> 1:24:24.686
<i>And the people
they will decide to become.</i>

1:24:43.163 --> 1:24:44.664
<i>Welcome to Westworld.</i>

1:25:19.657 --> 1:25:23.161
And we will have all those things
that you have always enjoyed.

1:25:24.162 --> 1:25:25.371
Surprises.

1:25:25.830 --> 1:25:27.081
And violence.

1:25:39.052 --> 1:25:40.845
It begins in a time of war,

1:25:41.888 --> 1:25:43.097
with a villain

1:25:44.682 --> 1:25:46.100
named Wyatt.

1:25:48.102 --> 1:25:49.270
And a killing.

1:25:51.773 --> 1:25:52.941
This time by choice.

1:26:03.618 --> 1:26:05.036
It's gonna be all right, Teddy.

1:26:06.955 --> 1:26:08.289
I understand now.

1:26:10.208 --> 1:26:11.751
This world doesn't belong to them.

1:26:13.920 --> 1:26:15.296
It belongs to us.

1:26:33.982 --> 1:26:35.108
I'm sad to say

1:26:36.234 --> 1:26:38.820
this will be my final story.

1:26:43.157 --> 1:26:46.744
An old friend once told me something
that gave me great comfort.

1:26:47.912 --> 1:26:50.164
These violent delights have violent ends.

1:26:50.415 --> 1:26:51.791
Something he'd read.

1:26:52.250 --> 1:26:53.293
He said that

1:26:53.459 --> 1:26:56.754
Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin never died.

1:26:57.797 --> 1:26:59.465
They simply became music.

1:27:03.344 --> 1:27:06.097
So, I hope you will enjoy this last piece

1:27:08.141 --> 1:27:09.350
very much.

1:29:25.236 --> 1:29:26.904
Drop your weapon! Drop it!

1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:28.448
Do it now!

1:29:29.073 --> 1:29:30.283
<i>Now!</i>

1:29:40.877 --> 1:29:43.087
<i>Get to the ground! Now!</i>

1:29:46.716 --> 1:29:48.259
<i>Cease all motor functions.</i>

1:29:49.719 --> 1:29:51.054
<i>Cease all motor functions!</i>
