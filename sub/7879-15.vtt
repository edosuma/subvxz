00:40.693 --> 00:42.603
Jeff and Hayley are killing me!

00:42.728 --> 00:45.880
I don't care if you are Sean
Connery, that's my jet ski.

00:49.868 --> 00:51.469
You know what time it is?
Shh!

00:52.593 --> 00:54.148
Dad, Jeff worked a long day,

00:54.273 --> 00:56.765
and now all he wants to do
is watch <i>Bones</i> and relax.

00:56.931 --> 00:59.253
Hey, Bones, look at this bone.

00:59.378 --> 01:01.305
I know.
But did you see this bone?

01:01.430 --> 01:02.623
Where'd you find that bone?

01:02.748 --> 01:04.074
Same place you got your bone.

01:04.199 --> 01:06.775
It was just sitting
here, next to this bone.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.596
Dr. Brennan, bone call.

01:08.721 --> 01:09.897
They said it was important.

01:10.022 --> 01:12.940
Something about a bone?

01:17.329 --> 01:18.906
Morning, Mr. S.

01:19.031 --> 01:20.074
You mind keeping that running?

01:20.199 --> 01:21.790
I'm 'a need to rinse off.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.015
Can I get the syrup?

01:28.140 --> 01:29.199
Oh, sure thing, Mr. S.

01:29.324 --> 01:30.340
Let me just...

01:38.067 --> 01:38.943
That's it!

01:39.068 --> 01:40.642
I can't live like this anymore!

01:40.808 --> 01:41.612
Stan.

01:41.737 --> 01:43.213
He took all the syrup!

01:43.338 --> 01:46.166
I asked for the syrup
and he took all the syrup!

01:46.291 --> 01:47.334
I work hard!

01:47.459 --> 01:49.359
Why do I have to share
with these (bleep)?!

01:49.525 --> 01:52.773
Dad, Jeff and I want to move out
just as bad as you want us to.

01:52.898 --> 01:54.875
But I'm going to school
full-time and Jeff's already

01:55.000 --> 01:57.094
working double shifts
at the Koo Koo Ranch.

01:57.219 --> 01:58.660
I'm only making minimum wage.

01:58.826 --> 02:00.230
Give me a break, the minimum wage is

02:00.355 --> 02:01.663
plenty for you guys to live on.

02:01.829 --> 02:02.800
No, it's not.

02:02.925 --> 02:05.625
After taxes,
Jeff only makes $938 a month.

02:05.791 --> 02:07.838
That's almost
a thousand dollars, a cold G.

02:07.963 --> 02:09.378
I could easily live on that.

02:09.544 --> 02:10.907
I'd love to see you try.

02:11.032 --> 02:11.965
Yeah, me, too.

02:12.131 --> 02:14.028
Are you calling me out, Jeff?

02:14.153 --> 02:15.796
You calling me out, Jefe?

02:15.921 --> 02:17.564
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

02:17.689 --> 02:20.534
Francine and I are going to live
out of this house for one month

02:20.659 --> 02:24.338
on $938, just to prove
to you guys how easy it is.

02:24.463 --> 02:27.105
If we succeed, then you two
mooches have to move out.

02:27.271 --> 02:28.482
Oh, you are on.

02:28.648 --> 02:29.910
I don't know, Stan.

02:30.035 --> 02:31.745
A reverse <i>Brewster's Millions?</i>

02:31.870 --> 02:33.147
Is this really necessary?

02:33.272 --> 02:34.248
Absolutely.

02:34.373 --> 02:37.418
Okay, a reverse BM it is.

02:37.543 --> 02:39.953
Hey, that came out funny.

02:40.078 --> 02:42.795
Was that a joke, do you think?

03:18.030 --> 03:19.991
Childish bitches!

03:20.783 --> 03:21.910
Losers!

03:22.076 --> 03:23.597
Pushing a toy across the floor

03:23.722 --> 03:26.623
is nothing like
driving a real Ferrari.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.302
Shut up, Klaus!
You don't know.

03:28.427 --> 03:29.737
You don't know
what you're talking about.

03:29.862 --> 03:30.794
What do you know?

03:30.960 --> 03:34.608
I know because I drove
a real Ferrari.

03:34.733 --> 03:36.410
Testarossa Spider.

03:36.535 --> 03:37.694
Bright yellow.

03:37.819 --> 03:40.247
Topless down the Autobahn.

03:40.372 --> 03:41.698
Ah.

03:41.823 --> 03:44.601
You two will never know
how that feels.

03:44.726 --> 03:47.421
People like you don't drive Ferraris.

03:47.546 --> 03:50.090
You just push little ones
with your hand,

03:50.215 --> 03:52.092
like playing with yourselves.

03:52.217 --> 03:53.794
And just like
playing with yourselves,

03:53.919 --> 03:57.445
it can never compare
to the real thing.

03:57.611 --> 04:00.184
I'm talking about hot fur, gentlemen.

04:00.309 --> 04:03.754
Hot fur and Ferraris...
not for you two!

04:06.381 --> 04:08.192
Speaking of, I got to pack.

04:08.317 --> 04:10.394
I'm headed to Vegas in an hour.

04:10.519 --> 04:11.762
You're going to Vegas?
With who?

04:11.887 --> 04:13.080
Oh, some of my boys.

04:13.205 --> 04:15.249
My boy Larry owns the night club Tao,

04:15.374 --> 04:18.175
so, you know, we should
have a pretty good time.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.892
Here's your $938 in cash.

04:25.017 --> 04:26.560
Enjoy your month of poverty.

04:26.685 --> 04:30.130
And enjoy your last month
of sucking money from my veins

04:30.255 --> 04:34.168
like a leech that attached
itself to my leg in the, uh...

04:34.293 --> 04:38.005
Big-Big Mooch Swamp, near, um...

04:39.831 --> 04:43.777
Looking for a town name that
also implies... Freeloadburg!

04:47.119 --> 04:49.683
Uh-uh, you can't take the SUV.

04:49.808 --> 04:51.919
You could never afford that
on minimum wage.

04:52.044 --> 04:54.254
Then, how are we supposed to
get to the apartment we found?

04:54.379 --> 04:56.080
The same way the maids get around.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.360
We can't ride on the bus.

05:00.485 --> 05:02.302
We're white.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.847
Francine, it's fine.

05:03.972 --> 05:05.749
But when we come back in 30 days,

05:05.874 --> 05:08.109
you two freeloaders
better start packing.

05:33.618 --> 05:35.829
Hey, Rog, I was thinking
about taking a joy ride

05:35.954 --> 05:37.764
on a Brazilian topless beach.

05:37.889 --> 05:40.567
That is, if your
imagination's up for it.

05:40.692 --> 05:42.269
Klaus was right, it's embarrassing

05:42.394 --> 05:43.403
playing with that toy car.

05:43.528 --> 05:44.504
We're not doing it anymore!

05:45.731 --> 05:46.940
I'm sorry, Steve.

05:47.065 --> 05:49.610
The fish has just got me all twisted.

05:49.735 --> 05:52.477
Can't believe Klaus has done
something that I haven't.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.480
So, why don't we just
drive a real Ferrari then?

05:55.646 --> 05:56.750
If I could afford one,

05:56.875 --> 05:58.218
do you think I'd be
living in this attic?!

06:00.145 --> 06:01.288
I'm sorry, Steve.

06:01.413 --> 06:02.322
I-I'm just... boom!

06:03.648 --> 06:04.992
I'm sorry, Steve.

06:05.117 --> 06:06.126
That was building.

06:06.251 --> 06:08.512
Th-That was physics is all that was.

06:08.637 --> 06:11.698
I just can't stand that Klaus
has driven a real Ferrari.

06:11.823 --> 06:14.568
Maybe one of us knows
someone with a Ferrari?

06:14.693 --> 06:15.686
Are you testing me?!

06:15.811 --> 06:17.104
Do you want another piece of pie?!

06:17.229 --> 06:18.739
Hey, "test."

06:18.864 --> 06:19.973
There it is, of course.

06:20.098 --> 06:22.066
All we have to do
is test-drive a car.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.162
Here, put this on.
Why?

06:25.287 --> 06:26.797
Because, if we're going
to test drive Ferraris,

06:26.922 --> 06:28.096
we need to look the part.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.167
Like Al Pacino in <i>Scent of a Woman,</i>

06:30.292 --> 06:31.818
when he convinces that sales guy

06:31.943 --> 06:34.288
to let him
and Chris O'Donnell take a car.

06:34.413 --> 06:38.148
Interesting fact: Chris
O'Donnell, no mental handicap.

06:40.774 --> 06:44.821
I just love the original details
in these old buildings.

06:44.987 --> 06:45.966
This place is perfect.

06:46.091 --> 06:47.657
For $350 a month, we'll take it.

06:47.823 --> 06:48.936
$350?

06:49.061 --> 06:50.577
No, this is $1,250.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.239
Not according to this listing.

06:52.364 --> 06:53.640
Mm-hmm, okay.

06:53.765 --> 06:56.610
You all are looking for
1345 <i>South</i> Sycamore.

06:56.735 --> 06:58.376
This is <i>North</i> Sycamore.

06:58.542 --> 07:02.349
Neighborhoods always get worse
when you head south.

07:02.474 --> 07:03.965
How far south is it?

07:04.131 --> 07:08.261
South.

07:11.149 --> 07:12.266
Well, here we are.

07:24.296 --> 07:25.820
I like it.

07:30.735 --> 07:32.245
Charlotte!

07:32.370 --> 07:34.214
Charlotte, I know
you in there, bitch!

07:34.339 --> 07:35.148
Leave me alone!

07:36.608 --> 07:37.517
It's okay, it'll be okay.

07:37.642 --> 07:38.518
We have light.

07:38.643 --> 07:39.953
L-Look at me.

07:40.078 --> 07:42.146
As long as we have light, we're okay.

07:46.668 --> 07:47.944
Open, bitch!

07:48.069 --> 07:50.781
Oh, can't we just let Jeff
and Hayley live at the house?

07:50.906 --> 07:52.716
And encourage their
freeloading lifestyle?

07:52.841 --> 07:53.817
No way!

07:53.942 --> 07:54.885
Look, it's just one month.

07:55.010 --> 07:55.919
We'll get used to it.

07:57.112 --> 07:57.954
Oh, back you go!

08:03.185 --> 08:04.361
It's okay.
It's over, Francine.

08:04.486 --> 08:05.362
She's dead.

08:05.487 --> 08:07.364
She's finally dead.

08:07.489 --> 08:08.856
She's dead now.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.649
New plan, baby.

08:28.774 --> 08:31.018
New Pontiac Aztek plan.

08:31.143 --> 08:32.019
What?

08:32.144 --> 08:33.421
We can't live there.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.323
That's how dumb people
live on minimum wage.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.058
This is how smart people
live on minimum wageg.

08:38.225 --> 08:40.145
So we're going to live in a car?

08:40.311 --> 08:42.397
It's not just a car,
it's a tent on wheels.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.148
But how can we afford this?

08:44.273 --> 08:47.569
We only have $938
for the whole month.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.787
I only paid 400 bucks
for this bad boy.

08:49.912 --> 08:51.756
400? How?

08:51.881 --> 08:53.858
Well, first I had to find
a Pontiac dealership,

08:53.983 --> 08:55.226
which wasn't easy.

08:55.351 --> 08:57.728
Then I told them I
wanted to buy an Aztek.

08:57.853 --> 08:59.864
Then I paid them $400.

08:59.989 --> 09:02.700
So, between the car
and the money we wasted

09:02.825 --> 09:06.437
on that apartment,
we have less than $200 left.

09:06.562 --> 09:08.355
What are we supposed to eat?

09:08.480 --> 09:10.057
Potatoes and rice!

09:10.182 --> 09:12.526
Cheap, and enough to
last us the whole month.

09:12.651 --> 09:14.345
Whoa, whoa, easy boy.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.479
W-What do you want?

09:15.604 --> 09:16.714
You want the potatoes?

09:16.839 --> 09:19.183
Y-You want us to dance?
Is that what you want?

09:19.308 --> 09:20.585
He wants us to dance, Francine.

09:20.710 --> 09:21.719
Dance, Francine!

09:21.844 --> 09:23.137
Dance to stay alive!

09:23.262 --> 09:24.288
Is this what you want?!

09:24.413 --> 09:26.191
Is this how you like it?!

09:28.859 --> 09:31.128
Afternoon.

09:31.253 --> 09:34.131
My associate and I are here
to test drive your Ferraris.

09:34.256 --> 09:37.235
Uh, sorry, sir, but we don't
just let these cars

09:37.360 --> 09:38.620
out the door so easily.

09:38.786 --> 09:39.954
What's your quota, Freddy?

09:40.120 --> 09:41.623
What? My name's Andrew.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.908
How many Ferraris you sell
this month, though?

09:44.033 --> 09:44.976
Freddy, the '80s are over.

09:45.101 --> 09:46.377
Are you trying to tell me

09:46.502 --> 09:48.045
these things are just
walking out of the store?

09:48.212 --> 09:49.981
I said my name is Andrew.

09:50.106 --> 09:52.550
L-Look, people always
want to buy Ferraris.

09:52.716 --> 09:54.619
Well, if you like it that much,
why don't you sleep with it?

09:54.744 --> 09:55.720
Why you selling it?

09:55.845 --> 09:57.388
That's an odd thing to say.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.824
If this car performs
the way I expect it to,

09:59.949 --> 10:02.927
you will get a certified check
of 101,000 and change

10:03.052 --> 10:04.962
when you come in here
tomorrow morning.

10:05.087 --> 10:07.698
This is a $320,000 car.

10:07.823 --> 10:10.101
Freddy, for you, 107 all in.

10:10.226 --> 10:12.937
Plus a case of champagne
to go with your leftover turkey.

10:13.062 --> 10:15.906
Uh, okay, I feel like
you're quoting something.

10:16.031 --> 10:18.175
I-I don't feel like I'm
in on the joke, though.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.677
Don't worry about the boy.

10:19.802 --> 10:22.179
He drives so smooth you can
boil an egg on the engine.

10:22.304 --> 10:24.666
When we bring the car back,
I'll peel the egg for you.

10:24.832 --> 10:28.319
We're not having
a real conversation, are we?

10:28.444 --> 10:29.887
Y-You're just waiting
for me to finish

10:30.012 --> 10:31.464
so you can say your next thing.

10:31.630 --> 10:34.025
Freddy, you're no
spring chicken, are you?

10:34.150 --> 10:37.094
Come on, man, you
don't have to do this.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.563
Two thousand.

10:39.688 --> 10:42.316
And unless you take it,
you're gonna make me cry.

10:42.441 --> 10:45.395
I'm a gray ghost, too.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.855
I can't believe that worked!

10:48.021 --> 10:49.123
This is amazing!

10:49.248 --> 10:50.358
So, where are we going?

10:50.483 --> 10:53.477
To find Klaus, so he can
see exactly what's up.

10:53.602 --> 10:56.614
Find us some kick-ass
driving music, compadre.

11:00.576 --> 11:01.744
Yeah!
Yeah!

11:09.535 --> 11:11.829
I can't get warm.

11:11.954 --> 11:13.922
I know what'll warm us up.

11:17.059 --> 11:17.902
Sex.

11:18.027 --> 11:19.103
No, Stan.

11:19.228 --> 11:21.347
Those homeless people
are watching us.

11:21.513 --> 11:23.474
It's okay.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.443
Francine, we don't have much,

11:25.568 --> 11:27.111
but we do have each other.

11:27.236 --> 11:28.996
I think we should sex each other.

11:29.121 --> 11:29.947
He's right.

11:30.072 --> 11:32.116
I don't want to sex, Stan.

11:32.241 --> 11:33.384
Go away!

11:33.509 --> 11:35.152
<i>You</i> go away!

11:35.277 --> 11:36.921
Is this what you want for Hayley?

11:37.046 --> 11:39.023
Is this how you want her to live?

11:39.148 --> 11:41.058
You mean young and free,
listening to great music,

11:41.183 --> 11:43.711
surrounded by a community that's
looking out for each other?

11:43.836 --> 11:45.713
Hey, guys, you gonna do it or what?

11:45.838 --> 11:49.042
My boner's <i>freezing</i> out here.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.956
You sure, Francine?

11:56.081 --> 11:56.924
It's awfully refreshing.

11:57.090 --> 11:58.859
I'm depressed.

11:58.984 --> 12:01.137
I'm gonna go take a nap in the car.

12:01.386 --> 12:02.986
Wait. Where's the car?

12:07.017 --> 12:08.061
No!

12:08.227 --> 12:09.503
No, that's where we live!

12:09.628 --> 12:10.971
No!

12:11.096 --> 12:12.607
Stan, it's time to go home.

12:12.831 --> 12:15.042
And let Jeff and Hayley win?
Never!

12:15.167 --> 12:17.545
Look, Francine,
I know things look bleak,

12:17.670 --> 12:19.697
but if we stick together
and believe in each other,

12:19.822 --> 12:21.089
we can overcome anything.

12:23.626 --> 12:26.496
I just need to find
a place to take a (bleep).

12:32.960 --> 12:35.212
I got back to the room
at, like, 6:00.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.847
The sun was definitely up.

12:36.972 --> 12:39.950
I seriously can't go to strip
clubs when I drink, you guys.

12:49.309 --> 12:52.814
Come... on...

12:52.980 --> 12:57.402
You... gotta...

12:57.568 --> 13:02.573
be... kidding...

13:03.574 --> 13:05.967
me...!

13:07.828 --> 13:09.880
I don't want to do this, Stan.

13:10.005 --> 13:11.115
You're hungry, right?

13:11.240 --> 13:13.284
Just trust me, this will work.

13:13.409 --> 13:15.319
Ooh! What are these?!

13:15.444 --> 13:17.304
They're Jonah's Pizza Nosh.

13:17.429 --> 13:19.607
Made with three cheeses.
Great for a snack.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.475
Mmm! Lisa, try one.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.211
This might be the taste
you've been looking for.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.147
And is this one a different flavor?

13:26.272 --> 13:27.681
No, they're all the same.

13:27.806 --> 13:31.576
Lisa, try the other flavor and
tell me which one we should buy.

13:34.513 --> 13:35.723
Good, right?

13:35.848 --> 13:37.925
Now, I'm a successful
businessman on the go,

13:38.050 --> 13:40.778
who sometimes has to shovel food
in my mouth like a bear.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.670
Will these accommodate
my fast-paced lifestyle?

13:44.490 --> 13:45.790
They do!

13:48.243 --> 13:49.820
Francine, wait!

13:49.945 --> 13:51.005
I'm going home, Stan.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.841
Face it, we've lost!

13:53.966 --> 13:56.210
We've got no food, we've
got nowhere to sleep!

13:56.335 --> 13:58.445
That's not true.
We could sleep under a car.

13:58.570 --> 13:59.613
They're everywhere,

13:59.738 --> 14:01.674
and you can't get
fully raped under a car.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.467
Hayley was right.

14:03.592 --> 14:05.569
Minimum wage isn't enough to live on.

14:05.694 --> 14:08.014
I'm done!

14:08.263 --> 14:10.183
Yeah, go on and quit, you quitter!

14:10.349 --> 14:11.592
No, Francine, I'm sorry!

14:11.717 --> 14:12.593
Don't go!

14:12.718 --> 14:13.811
You!

14:13.977 --> 14:15.813
That's the guy, Jonah.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.532
So I hear you like
to sample things excessively

14:18.657 --> 14:19.967
and then not buy.

14:20.092 --> 14:22.236
Is that what you like to do?

14:23.654 --> 14:26.540
Those pizza bagels are my life.

14:26.665 --> 14:30.286
I make those tiny bagels by hand.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.697
That's right, Jonah, mush that face.

14:33.822 --> 14:35.733
I love you, baby.

14:35.858 --> 14:37.275
You are my queen, Rebecca.

14:41.646 --> 14:42.830
We can't do this anymore.

14:42.955 --> 14:44.565
I have to think about the election.

14:44.690 --> 14:47.136
You can't just use me up
and then leave me!

14:47.302 --> 14:48.752
I'll call your wife!

14:50.973 --> 14:52.456
You stay away from my family!

14:52.581 --> 14:53.976
I'll kill you!

14:55.084 --> 14:57.928
No! Come back!

15:01.623 --> 15:02.819
Good morning!

15:20.209 --> 15:21.462
Are you the Hamburglar?

15:21.628 --> 15:22.903
I'm the Hamburrobber!

15:23.028 --> 15:24.438
I did this to you!

15:24.563 --> 15:26.300
Tell your friends!

15:45.016 --> 15:47.511
Hello. I'm here about the job.

15:47.636 --> 15:49.013
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:49.138 --> 15:50.714
You're thinking that's
blood.

15:50.839 --> 15:52.716
It's just ketchup from
the Dumpster burger.

15:52.841 --> 15:54.118
Okay, time to go.

15:54.243 --> 15:55.519
W-Wait, please!

15:55.644 --> 15:57.321
I just need enough money
to get through the month

15:57.446 --> 15:58.656
so my daughter'll move out!

15:58.781 --> 16:00.960
You don't understand!
Please!

16:01.126 --> 16:03.077
Then I'm taking your shoes!

16:06.271 --> 16:08.582
Wait! You can have the shoes!

16:08.707 --> 16:11.218
Just leave the orthotics!

16:11.343 --> 16:16.348
They were specifically designed
by Dr. Ross for my feet only!

16:16.899 --> 16:18.676
I pronate!

16:18.801 --> 16:21.536
They help reduce the stress
to my ankles!

16:24.173 --> 16:25.234
Yah, God!

16:27.960 --> 16:30.137
Shoes.

16:30.262 --> 16:31.805
Burgundy dress shoes.

16:31.930 --> 16:33.374
New shoes, man?

16:33.499 --> 16:35.943
Nice stitching...

16:36.068 --> 16:37.344
wooden sole...

16:37.469 --> 16:39.179
Where were these made?

16:39.304 --> 16:40.314
I don't know.

16:40.439 --> 16:41.732
Just, get out of here, man!

16:41.857 --> 16:42.783
Shoes.

16:42.908 --> 16:43.734
Got shoes here.

16:43.859 --> 16:45.302
Where'd you get those?

16:45.427 --> 16:47.087
Don't worry about it.
They're my shoes, okay?

16:47.212 --> 16:48.966
They look too small for you.

16:49.281 --> 16:50.758
Just ten bucks, man.
They'll fit you.

16:50.883 --> 16:52.559
They'll fit you nice.
Wear 'em to a party.

16:52.684 --> 16:54.795
Wear 'em with chinos
and no socks; it's a solid look.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.057
What's it matter
where they came from?

16:56.223 --> 16:58.332
It matters because I'm a cop.

16:58.457 --> 16:59.477

Leg is busted.

17:34.693 --> 17:36.070
Bleeding out.

17:36.195 --> 17:38.605
Excuse me, Rude-y Huxtable.

This is a free clinic.

17:40.332 --> 17:42.561

17:47.890 --> 17:49.800
How long have you been waiting?

17:49.925 --> 17:51.635
Six, seven hour.

What are you here for?

17:52.995 --> 17:54.738
My elbow feel funny.

My elbow feel strange.

17:57.649 --> 18:00.227
I-I am, I am just,
I am very near death.

18:00.352 --> 18:01.328
Can I go before you?

18:01.453 --> 18:04.515
No. My elbow feel funny.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.669
Ah!

18:28.523 --> 18:30.090

18:30.215 --> 18:31.792

18:31.917 --> 18:33.794
It'll make you all better.

18:33.919 --> 18:36.096
Sure, it's a natural remedy!

18:36.221 --> 18:37.264
Huff on this!

18:37.389 --> 18:38.367
What's in it?

18:38.533 --> 18:40.117
My body waste, silly.

18:40.242 --> 18:43.220
Huff on it, now.

18:43.345 --> 18:45.906
Whoa, hey, hey,
don't huff it all now.

18:46.031 --> 18:47.465
We's sharing.

18:49.818 --> 18:52.563
I'm thinking about pulling a job.

18:52.688 --> 18:55.833
A rob job.

18:55.958 --> 18:58.602
Yeah...!

18:58.727 --> 19:00.170
We do this job.

19:00.295 --> 19:02.506
One last jobber.

19:02.631 --> 19:05.742
And then we're out
of the game for good.

19:05.867 --> 19:07.711
I means it.

19:07.836 --> 19:09.780
One... final...

19:09.905 --> 19:11.915
jobber.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.862
I know just the place.

to amaze and inspire me!

It's a real Schtibly.

19:37.382 --> 19:39.026
A Schtoobly?

19:39.151 --> 19:40.594
No, a Schtibly.

19:40.719 --> 19:42.596
A Schtibly!

19:42.721 --> 19:45.199
Wow-wow!

Shh.

Die! Die! Die!

19:59.447 --> 20:00.998
Dad?!

20:01.123 --> 20:02.743
Stan, what are you doing?!

20:06.695 --> 20:08.205
I'm-I'm robbing us.

20:08.330 --> 20:09.806
I-I don't know!

20:09.931 --> 20:12.192
It's just, I just, it's too hard!

20:12.317 --> 20:13.293
You guys were right.

20:13.418 --> 20:14.995
You can't live on minimum wage.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.531
I did things out there!

20:17.656 --> 20:19.533
I did things
with my hands and my mouth

20:19.658 --> 20:22.736
that I'm not proud of just to get by!

20:22.861 --> 20:24.438
It-It's what you do!

20:24.563 --> 20:27.207
It's what you got to do!

20:27.332 --> 20:30.010
Dad, it's been less than two days.

20:30.135 --> 20:32.813
So, I guess this means we can stay?

20:32.938 --> 20:35.048
You can stay here
as long as you need.

20:35.173 --> 20:40.203
I'm just so happy that you kids
are here, safe with us.

20:40.328 --> 20:42.823
This, this huff has just got me
so emotional.

20:42.948 --> 20:43.924
I love you all so...

20:45.744 --> 20:46.996
Who is this guy?!

20:52.334 --> 20:53.600
What's he doing?

20:53.725 --> 20:54.801
He's dying.

20:54.926 --> 20:55.802
No, he's drawing something.

20:55.927 --> 20:57.214
Hey, he's playing Pictionary!

20:57.380 --> 20:59.306
Ooh, I love Pictionary!

20:59.431 --> 21:01.558
Is it, uh, is it an angel?

21:01.683 --> 21:02.442
No, tree.
Tree, tree!

21:02.567 --> 21:03.694
It's a tree!
