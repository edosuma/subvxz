WEBVTT

01:54.865 --> 01:56.992
That was pretty big.

02:02.331 --> 02:05.000
Oh, wow.
Patrick, look at that one.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.669
Look at that over there!

02:10.714 --> 02:13.967
Wow, look at this one.
Patrick, Patrick, can you catch it?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.517
Let’s go, Max.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.978
Sit.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.613
All right, sweetie. Come on.
You wanna take the doll?

02:34.696 --> 02:36.907
I bet this
totally messes it up.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.455
Sit.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.415
Max, heel.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.590
Honey, stay here for a second.
Mommy will be right back.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.934
Okay, Max, stay close.

03:08.397 --> 03:09.940
Patrick, stay on the blanket.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.073
Go, Max, in.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.584
Hi, Maja.
You okay?

03:29.126 --> 03:30.210
Hi, Sarah.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.756
How’s Lewis doing?
Patrick?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.675
Yeah, good.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.386
Did you make it to
the parent-teacher conference on Monday?

03:39.469 --> 03:41.513
I couldn’t make it.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.605
Take a look
at this waiting list.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.276
Ever think
we’d get this busy?

04:00.157 --> 04:01.658
I guess it’s good for business.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.911
Good for business. Right.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.958
- You should tell your husband that.
- Deep breath.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.755
Good.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.257
A lot of new guys
at the refinery these days.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.551
- You seem surprised I’m one of ’em.
- No, not at all.

04:19.635 --> 04:20.636
What do you do there?

04:20.719 --> 04:23.430
- Shift manager.
- Shift manager?

04:23.514 --> 04:26.016
It’s all right, Doc.
I don’t mind talking about it.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.520
6th Marine Division.
Lost the legs in Okinawa, second landing.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.231
- You serve?
- Medical Corps.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.316
But they only
sent me over in ’46.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.193
Can you lie on your back
for me, please?

04:39.071 --> 04:42.032
Yeah, I was in
an army hospital in Greece.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.659
Part of the reconstruction.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.496
It’s awful what happened
to the combat vets.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.998
Well, it’s not like
any of us chose it.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.001
Yeah?

04:53.085 --> 04:55.379
Anything you want to add
to the order before I call it in?

04:55.462 --> 04:56.547
Uh...

04:57.714 --> 05:00.342
We need Thorazine,

05:00.425 --> 05:02.970
Bentyl and some aspirin.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.097
It’s already on.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.891
And we’re running low on dressings,
so I put that on too.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.518
Eddie, this is my wife, Maja.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.812
- She helps run the office.
- Pleasure to meet you, ma’am.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.815
We met at that army hospital in Greece
I was telling you about.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.651
Couldn’t get enough of the local gals
so you brought one home with you.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.903
- Yeah.
- Actually, I’m Romanian.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.031
I was thinking maybe we could invite Eddie
over for dinner one of these nights.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.283
He’s new at the refinery.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.368
Oh, I don’t know, Doc.
I don’t want it to be awkward.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.621
No, it’s not awkward. Come on.
You deserve a proper welcome.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.707
What do you say, Maja? Wednesday?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.917
Sure.
Nice to meet you.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.259
Why did you invite
that guy for dinner?

06:25.802 --> 06:26.929
Why not?

06:29.348 --> 06:30.933
You didn’t have to invite him.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.811
Well, he’s new in town,
and he’s...

06:34.895 --> 06:36.897
You know,
it must be hard for him.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.152
He doesn’t need your pity.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.612
You made him feel awkward.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.322
- No, I didn’t.
- Yes, you did.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.823
I don’t think so.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.033
Yes, you did.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.037
No, I didn’t.

06:57.584 --> 07:01.755
Do you know that Mrs. Jackson
is arranging a lemonade contest?

07:01.839 --> 07:04.925
Patrick’s class?
Can you believe it?

07:05.008 --> 07:07.678
Everything in this country
is a competition.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.472
Well, you know, some things
are acts of kindness,

07:10.556 --> 07:12.683
like inviting a veteran,

07:12.766 --> 07:15.769
an injured veteran, over for dinner
’cause he’s new in town.

07:15.853 --> 07:18.480
Mmm. You just want to
save everyone, Doctor.

07:23.569 --> 07:24.903
Maybe I do.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.494
Some more than others.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.496
- Really?
- Really.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.292
- Really?
- Really.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.804
Why don’t you
take them out?

07:50.888 --> 07:53.515
- It took me one hour to put them in.
- Yeah?

07:53.599 --> 07:56.226
I’ll make you
look pretty right now.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.352
How?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.731
How?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.274
Have you heard
about the glow?

08:02.357 --> 08:03.775
Oh, you’re so ridiculous.

08:03.859 --> 08:06.153
I’m ridiculous?
Look at you with these curlers.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.988
Shut up. Get off me.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.827
Mommy, Mommy!

08:14.453 --> 08:15.495
Shit!

08:16.705 --> 08:18.624
I can’t sleep.
It’s too dark.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.542
You’re lying on my glasses.

08:20.626 --> 08:23.128
- They’re in my butt.
- Take your butt...

08:23.212 --> 08:25.172
Daddy’s messing up
Mommy’s curlers.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.132
We were wrestling.

08:27.216 --> 08:30.177
Daddy will be in,
in a minute.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.263
- Just stay right here.
- Yeah, you stay. Don’t move.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.102
- You can’t go in naked with Patrick.
- I know.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.270
I’m getting
my underwear.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.568
- Bear.
- Very good.

08:46.652 --> 08:48.737
- Clown.
- Good.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.198
And what about
this one?

08:52.366 --> 08:53.700
- Boat.
- Good.

08:56.495 --> 08:57.996
- Rabbit.
- Good.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.207
He’s catching your accent.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.333
The R’s.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.751
No, he’s not.

09:02.835 --> 09:04.169
- Is he?
- Mm-hmm.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.297
Then you tell him
how to say it.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.507
Rabbit.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.425
- Rabbit.
- Exactly.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.929
Yeah. Always say it like Daddy
and your teachers, not like me.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.098
A rabbit.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.891
- Rabbit.
- Oh, really?

09:17.975 --> 09:19.393
- Very funny.
- Patrick Reed.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.104
- I like that one.
- Patrick Reed.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.106
Rudolph the reindeer.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.899
Rudolph the reindeer.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.026
- Do you wanna do it instead?
- I would love to.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.028
- Okay, go ahead.
- Bear.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.239
How many eggs?

09:33.115 --> 09:34.157
One...

09:35.325 --> 09:36.451
two...

09:38.912 --> 09:39.913
three.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.373
What about over there?

09:41.456 --> 09:44.459
Four. Four eggs.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.837
We need a spare for this,
and I don’t have time.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.380
Do you mind
going to Mitchell’s?

09:48.463 --> 09:50.215
Sure,
I’ll do it today.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.433
Okay. Let’s do it.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.311
I’m still missing some files
for the new workers.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.687
You mind
calling the refinery?

10:03.770 --> 10:06.148
- Ask for them?
- I already did. I’ll call them again.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.453
No, we just moved here
from Virginia.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.666
The weather’s a lot better here,
I can tell you that.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.210
That’s, what? Five, six...

10:26.293 --> 10:27.586
- Seven.
- Seven.

10:30.422 --> 10:34.051
But I like knowing that
I have a good hardware store near me.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.220
- Thank you so much. Have a good day.
- Thank you, sir.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.346
Have a good day.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.271
You all right, Maja?

11:54.131 --> 11:55.299
Thanks again.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.134
You have a good
rest of your day.

12:30.501 --> 12:33.670
What are you looking for?

12:33.754 --> 12:36.298
What are you doing over there?
Come here.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.135
Hi, sweetie.

12:40.219 --> 12:43.639
So they didn’t have today’s paper.
I brought yesterday’s.

13:18.549 --> 13:21.134
I still don’t understand.
Did they find all the parcels?

13:21.218 --> 13:22.511
I mean, it says here...

13:28.600 --> 13:30.352
Then they don’t
have that number.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.313
See?

13:36.191 --> 13:38.110
It says here, but then you have the...

13:39.945 --> 13:41.238
Quiet, Max.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.537
Annabel.
I told you these aren’t toys.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.497
Do I have to
take the delivery tomorrow?

13:50.581 --> 13:52.541
I mean, I have to be
at the refinery at 5:00.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.334
I know, I know.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.044
I’m not taking the car.
I’m walking.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.838
- Tell them I’ll be late.
- Come on, let’s go back inside.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.799
- Rachel!
- I said I’d call them later.

14:21.987 --> 14:24.114
Where the hell
have you been?

14:24.198 --> 14:26.241
You forgot
to pick up Patrick.

14:28.452 --> 14:31.663
Um, I’m sorry.
I lost track of time,

14:31.747 --> 14:33.248
and I thought school
must have called...

14:33.332 --> 14:35.459
Yeah, his teacher had to
bring him home.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.295
Did something happen?

14:39.630 --> 14:41.340
- No.
- Then where were you?

14:41.423 --> 14:43.467
With Diane,
I told you.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.178
Diane? No. No, you didn’t
tell me anything.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.604
Are we doing this again?

14:58.774 --> 15:00.275
Is this where we are now?

15:03.237 --> 15:04.780
No. I’m fine.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.378
I’m sorry
I didn’t pick you up today.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.715
Mommy had to
deal with something.

15:33.267 --> 15:34.643
I played with Rick.

15:36.395 --> 15:38.272
Did you play
with the football?

15:39.189 --> 15:40.607
- Baseball.
- Mmm.

15:45.654 --> 15:48.448
- You want to see how high we can make it?
- Mm-hmm.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.242
Why don’t you use these?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.997
- Can I get a bag for these?
- Oh, sure.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.756
- What do I owe you?
- I’ll put it on your account.

18:06.170 --> 18:10.215
Hello. I’m so glad you passed by.
My car broke down.

18:13.302 --> 18:17.055
I’m really not an expert,
but I’ll take a look if you want.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.558
Would you?
This happened before.

18:20.559 --> 18:22.477
I think I have some plugs
back here.

18:22.561 --> 18:24.563
I just don’t know
what they look like.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.860
I really don’t know much
about any...

21:28.622 --> 21:29.665
What do you want?

21:31.041 --> 21:32.251
What do you want?

21:34.503 --> 21:36.129
Please... please.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.131
Don’t look at me.

21:39.216 --> 21:40.759
Look away!

21:43.053 --> 21:45.430
I have children. Please.

22:11.248 --> 22:12.666
What do you want?

22:58.962 --> 22:59.963
Hello.

23:01.882 --> 23:03.634
- How is everything?
- Great.

23:03.717 --> 23:05.010
They play
so nicely together.

23:07.346 --> 23:08.931
I promised to take them
to the movies.

23:09.014 --> 23:10.682
Oh, sure.
What’s playing?

23:12.643 --> 23:14.478
Uh, <i>Sleeping Beauty.</i>

23:18.106 --> 23:19.983
I have days like that too.

23:20.067 --> 23:21.652
<i>...we’d be a much healthier nation.</i>

23:21.735 --> 23:25.781
<i>Okay, Irving. We’ll work by the cookie jar
and it’ll solve both problems.</i>

23:27.991 --> 23:30.244
<i>Wow. Did you see those...</i>

23:30.327 --> 23:31.328
Hey.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.330
- Hey.
- Hey, bud.

23:34.122 --> 23:35.249
How was your day?

23:35.332 --> 23:37.501
Good.
I went to Stuart’s house.

23:37.584 --> 23:38.836
Nice.

23:38.919 --> 23:40.462
- You have fun?
- Yeah.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.302
<i>Hello, Sarge.</i>

23:47.386 --> 23:49.263
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

23:51.181 --> 23:52.182
What is it?

24:00.607 --> 24:04.152
I always told you
that my family wasn’t in the war.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.239
That we were living in Bucharest.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.660
It’s not true.

24:12.953 --> 24:15.289
I was in a German camp
for two years.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.794
What are you talking about?

24:22.421 --> 24:24.339
Why were you in a camp?

24:26.717 --> 24:28.552
It wasn’t...

24:28.635 --> 24:31.555
just my grandfather
who was a Roma.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.557
A Gypsy.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.726
It was my mother too.

24:35.809 --> 24:37.019
And my father.

24:37.853 --> 24:39.813
All of us actually.

24:42.608 --> 24:44.193
I didn’t tell you because...

24:45.986 --> 24:47.112
Why not?

24:52.409 --> 24:55.495
When Romania joined the war,

24:55.579 --> 24:58.040
they gave us to the Nazis.

24:58.123 --> 25:02.252
And when the Nazis were losing later,
and the Russians came,

25:02.336 --> 25:04.505
everything was falling apart.

25:04.588 --> 25:07.633
Prisoners, guards,
everyone was escaping.

25:07.716 --> 25:10.761
I was in a small group,
mostly women.

25:10.844 --> 25:14.097
We were heading west,
back to Romania, back home.

25:14.806 --> 25:16.308
We thought we made it.

25:18.852 --> 25:23.190
We were sleeping when
some German soldiers, SS, found us.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.235
They were drunk.

25:26.318 --> 25:28.070
They shot some of us. They...

25:31.031 --> 25:34.493
They did horrible things to the women.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.119
Worse than you can imagine.

25:38.872 --> 25:40.958
Why didn’t you ever tell me this?

25:52.094 --> 25:53.846
I tried to deal with it alone.

25:53.929 --> 25:57.850
I tried to make it go away
so you would never have to know, but...

26:08.861 --> 26:09.987
Lewis...

26:11.280 --> 26:12.614
he’s in the trunk...

26:13.615 --> 26:14.950
of our car.

26:16.702 --> 26:18.412
Just... Just... Whoa...

26:20.539 --> 26:22.124
What are you talking about?

26:22.207 --> 26:24.501
What? Who?

26:35.762 --> 26:37.973
What the hell did you do?

26:38.056 --> 26:40.392
What are we supposed
to do with him?

26:40.475 --> 26:43.061
- We have to kill him.
- What? What are you talking about?

26:43.145 --> 26:44.646
- Nobody saw me take him.
- No.

26:44.730 --> 26:47.524
We’re not killing anyone, okay?
We’re gonna take him to the police...

26:47.608 --> 26:48.901
- No. No, no, no.
- Yes. Yes.

26:48.984 --> 26:50.652
- The police will investigate.
- We can’t go to the police.

26:50.736 --> 26:52.821
- Then we’ll have to let him go.
- We can’t let him go.

26:52.905 --> 26:55.365
- I kidnapped him. I tried to kill him.
- Shh! Quiet.

27:06.752 --> 27:08.378
You don’t believe me.

27:08.462 --> 27:11.381
I don’t know what to believe.
I mean, you never told me any of this.

27:11.465 --> 27:14.676
You looked me in the eye and you told me
something very different. Right?

27:14.760 --> 27:17.304
We’ve dealt with a lot of issues.

27:17.387 --> 27:19.973
Psychiatrists, nightmares,
sleeping in the car.

27:21.350 --> 27:22.559
Because of him.

27:22.643 --> 27:23.977
The show is done.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.524
Mommy, the show is done.

27:28.607 --> 27:31.568
Hey, bud, go brush your teeth.
Mommy will be right in.

27:36.281 --> 27:37.324
Patrick!

27:38.659 --> 27:42.412
We have to bring him in.
He’ll wake up soon.

27:44.540 --> 27:45.582
Okay.

27:45.666 --> 27:47.167
Just for one night.

28:13.068 --> 28:14.069
Okay.

28:16.822 --> 28:17.990
Here.

28:19.408 --> 28:20.951
Here.

28:47.603 --> 28:48.729
Water...

28:51.565 --> 28:52.900
Water...

29:25.182 --> 29:26.517
You don’t remember me?

29:35.901 --> 29:37.110
What is your name?

29:39.863 --> 29:41.532
Thomas.

29:41.615 --> 29:42.699
Thomas Steinmann.

29:47.621 --> 29:50.457
Doing a good job
hiding that German accent.

29:50.541 --> 29:51.708
I’m not German. I’m Swiss.

29:51.792 --> 29:52.793
Swiss...

30:01.343 --> 30:02.594
Karl.

30:03.595 --> 30:05.806
Someone called you Karl.

30:05.889 --> 30:08.642
My name is Thomas Steinmann.

30:08.725 --> 30:11.478
I... I just moved to this town.

30:11.562 --> 30:12.938
I work at the refinery.

30:13.021 --> 30:15.899
I have a wife, Rachel...

30:16.900 --> 30:18.151
two children.

30:18.235 --> 30:21.655
I don’t know who you’re
confusing me with, but...

30:21.738 --> 30:23.365
just let me go.

30:23.448 --> 30:25.284
I won’t tell anyone.
I promise.

30:25.367 --> 30:26.493
I got hit in the head.

30:26.577 --> 30:29.121
I’m confused.
I won’t recognize your faces.

30:29.204 --> 30:31.874
Just let me go.
I need to see my family again.

30:31.957 --> 30:33.792
You will never see your family again!

30:35.294 --> 30:37.546
Does he even
look the same to you?

30:37.629 --> 30:40.215
Well, no, I mean...

30:40.299 --> 30:42.759
Yes, his eyes.
I will never forget those eyes.

30:42.843 --> 30:44.678
- We need to be certain.
- I am certain.

30:44.761 --> 30:46.638
Well, I need to be certain too.

30:52.603 --> 30:53.979
I mean,

30:54.062 --> 30:57.399
what’s the likelihood that a guy
that attacked you 15 years ago

30:57.482 --> 31:00.110
halfway around the world, he ends up
two blocks away from our house?

31:00.194 --> 31:01.445
Yes.

31:01.528 --> 31:03.197
Yes, I know.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.406
Exactly.

31:12.164 --> 31:13.707
Maja. Maja.

31:13.790 --> 31:14.917
Maja, wait!

31:16.001 --> 31:17.127
Maja.

31:20.923 --> 31:22.758
How dare you?

31:22.841 --> 31:26.053
How dare you look me in the eyes
and deny who you are?

31:26.136 --> 31:27.471
I’m not...

31:27.554 --> 31:30.098
I will never
forget your face, Karl.

31:31.767 --> 31:33.477
I remember your whistle.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.312
You woke us up.
You hit me.

31:36.813 --> 31:39.024
Your hands smelled of alcohol.

31:39.107 --> 31:42.027
Your eyes, the way you looked at me
when you were choking me.

31:43.153 --> 31:44.279
My sister...

31:45.155 --> 31:47.950
My sister, Miriah, remember her?

31:50.160 --> 31:52.371
Your Nazi friends dragged her away.

31:52.454 --> 31:54.331
I must remind you
of someone.

31:54.414 --> 31:57.376
The way I talk, the way I look.
Maybe my accent.

31:57.459 --> 32:00.504
I was never in the war.
I was in Switzerland the entire time.

32:00.587 --> 32:01.672
I worked as a clerk.

32:01.755 --> 32:03.841
- Shut up!
- I have documents to prove it.

32:03.924 --> 32:07.135
You have to give me a chance to prove it.
You’ll be an accomplice...

32:16.603 --> 32:17.604
Coward!

32:20.190 --> 32:21.775
You coward!

32:34.538 --> 32:37.082
What if he managed
to get up from the chair?

32:39.084 --> 32:40.752
He could kill us all.

32:43.422 --> 32:45.757
He won’t. He’s tied.

32:49.845 --> 32:50.971
You had a sister?

32:53.974 --> 32:56.602
I don’t want to
talk about it now.

33:58.956 --> 34:00.123
I...

34:12.803 --> 34:13.971
I have to go.

34:23.397 --> 34:24.481
I have to go.

35:11.236 --> 35:13.155
I was a civilian the entire war.

35:14.281 --> 35:16.825
I lived in Zürich.
I met my wife there.

35:17.826 --> 35:19.411
And we immigrated in ’46.

35:40.807 --> 35:41.808
Help!

35:50.943 --> 35:52.611
Help! Help!

36:17.261 --> 36:18.262
Shit.

36:23.517 --> 36:25.811
Okay, I’m gonna go.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.020
No, I’ll do it.

36:36.196 --> 36:37.531
Did you hear that?

36:40.409 --> 36:42.494
I think it came from over there.

36:44.204 --> 36:46.707
- Did you hear it too?
- It woke us up.

36:48.333 --> 36:50.085
You think we should
call somebody?

36:54.047 --> 36:57.009
Nah. Let’s wait and see
in the morning.

37:00.012 --> 37:01.847
Okay. Well, good night.

37:01.930 --> 37:03.056
Good night, Jim.

37:14.985 --> 37:16.320
I’m gonna check on Patrick.

37:39.009 --> 37:40.010
No. No.

37:40.093 --> 37:41.261
Easy.

37:48.727 --> 37:50.062
It’s dislocated.

37:52.564 --> 37:54.441
Okay, I’m gonna
set it back for you.

37:54.525 --> 37:56.318
- Okay?
- No.

37:56.401 --> 37:58.195
- Yes. Yes.
- No, no, no.

37:58.278 --> 38:00.948
Okay, take a deep breath.

38:17.714 --> 38:19.132
I have children.

38:20.551 --> 38:22.302
I have two little children.

38:23.554 --> 38:25.973
My family depends on me.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.643
What did I...

38:31.937 --> 38:33.313
I’m not him.

38:38.277 --> 38:41.738
How’d I be able to prove it,
if you refuse to even listen to me?

39:04.970 --> 39:07.097
Mommy, can you cut my sausage?

39:10.350 --> 39:11.518
- Good morning.
- Morning, Lewis.

39:11.602 --> 39:12.603
Morning.

39:18.859 --> 39:22.321
I’m gonna go to the clinic and check
the files of the new refinery workers.

39:23.363 --> 39:25.365
No. Lewis,
don’t leave me alone with him.

39:25.449 --> 39:28.535
Yes. And I need to tell Albert
I’m not going to be in most of the day.

39:32.748 --> 39:35.042
If this guy truly is
one of the new ones,

39:35.125 --> 39:37.044
maybe his file
will be in the office.

39:39.713 --> 39:40.923
Right?

39:41.006 --> 39:42.049
Yeah.

39:43.926 --> 39:44.968
Yeah.

40:14.248 --> 40:15.624
Hey, Todd, my apologies.

40:15.707 --> 40:18.335
You’re gonna have to see Albert today.
I’m running late.

40:18.418 --> 40:20.504
Yes, sir, I have that down.

40:20.587 --> 40:21.797
And how long?

40:24.424 --> 40:26.176
Yes, it may be
a bit longer, but...

42:02.189 --> 42:04.233
I hope that comes
with a good story.

42:05.359 --> 42:08.570
Oh, it’s nothing.
I just... bumped my head.

42:11.281 --> 42:14.868
Remember Maja was having sleeping
problems maybe nine, ten years ago,

42:14.952 --> 42:16.870
you referred me to someone?

42:16.954 --> 42:20.415
The psychiatrist from, uh...
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

42:20.499 --> 42:22.000
- Nussbaum.
- Mm-hmm.

42:22.084 --> 42:25.128
I just tried to reach out to him,
but I couldn’t.

42:25.212 --> 42:26.755
He retired.

42:29.842 --> 42:31.134
Everything okay?

42:31.218 --> 42:33.387
Yeah, she’s just having
nightmares again.

42:33.470 --> 42:35.097
It’s not a big deal.

42:36.390 --> 42:38.475
I can find him for you.

42:38.559 --> 42:39.726
Anything I can do?

43:58.764 --> 44:01.850
This is insanity.
I’m a father. I have a...

44:08.357 --> 44:09.816
- Please stop.
- No more lies!

44:22.287 --> 44:24.081
Why are you doing this?

44:29.586 --> 44:32.548
It took me years
to put that night behind me,

44:32.631 --> 44:36.134
to stop seeing your face
in my dreams.

44:36.218 --> 44:39.555
I tried to forget you,
but you came here.

44:39.638 --> 44:42.057
- My name is Thomas Steinmann.
- Oh, shut up.

44:43.058 --> 44:45.143
I know who you are.

44:45.227 --> 44:46.937
And you know who I am.

44:52.317 --> 44:54.152
<i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

44:59.324 --> 45:00.784
<i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

45:00.868 --> 45:02.619
I would never say
something like that.

45:02.703 --> 45:04.663
<i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

45:05.622 --> 45:06.790
Say it.

45:08.709 --> 45:09.835
Say it!

45:11.795 --> 45:12.796
No.

45:14.590 --> 45:16.842
<i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

45:16.925 --> 45:17.926
Say it!

45:27.019 --> 45:29.188
- <i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>
- Louder.

45:30.814 --> 45:32.232
- Louder!
- <i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

45:32.316 --> 45:34.067
Scream it like you did then.

45:35.027 --> 45:36.987
- Scream it!
- <i>Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

45:37.070 --> 45:39.281
<i>Zigeuner Fotze.
Zigeuner Fotze.</i>

45:39.364 --> 45:40.949
That’s right.

45:41.658 --> 45:43.535
I’m the Gypsy cunt.

45:49.416 --> 45:50.459
I never said that.

45:51.210 --> 45:52.544
I never met you before.

46:09.937 --> 46:11.271
<i>What’s your name?</i>

46:17.069 --> 46:18.195
What’s your name?

46:21.698 --> 46:23.116
My name is Maja.

46:24.576 --> 46:26.119
Your name is Karl.

46:27.371 --> 46:29.623
And my sister’s name was Miriah.

46:34.336 --> 46:37.464
I want you to tell me
what happened that night.

46:39.550 --> 46:41.301
Everything you remember.

46:43.303 --> 46:45.305
I have nightmares about it.

46:47.933 --> 46:49.977
But I only see fragments.
I remember...

46:50.060 --> 46:52.521
If you only remember fragments,
how can you...

46:52.604 --> 46:54.189
Shut up!

47:02.948 --> 47:04.283
I remember...

47:06.368 --> 47:08.120
I remember being hit.

47:10.038 --> 47:13.292
I remember seeing soldiers
dragging my sister.

47:15.294 --> 47:16.920
I remember you.

47:18.338 --> 47:21.967
I remember you on top of me.
Inside me.

47:22.843 --> 47:24.553
But I...

47:24.636 --> 47:26.388
I don’t know if I...

47:28.390 --> 47:30.142
Did I run away?

47:31.435 --> 47:33.312
Did I leave her there?

47:36.899 --> 47:38.901
It’s running in my mind on a loop,

47:38.984 --> 47:41.195
but I can’t piece it together.

47:42.654 --> 47:44.740
Why my sister was shot
and not me.

47:44.823 --> 47:46.617
Why I survived and she didn’t.

47:49.953 --> 47:52.080
You have to help me remember.

47:54.416 --> 47:56.335
If you do, I won’t kill you.

47:58.754 --> 48:01.131
It’s your only way out of here alive.

48:05.219 --> 48:08.847
<i>Doctor, could it possibly be
that this is some kind of delusion?</i>

48:08.931 --> 48:11.683
I couldn’t possibly speculate
on something like that.

48:12.684 --> 48:13.852
If I remember correctly,

48:13.936 --> 48:16.188
she stopped coming in
after a few sessions anyway.

48:17.272 --> 48:19.816
<i>Why did she suddenly tell you all this?</i>

48:23.529 --> 48:26.490
We had a fight,
and she just said it.

48:27.616 --> 48:28.700
Look, this...

48:28.784 --> 48:32.037
She is talking about something
from 15 years ago.

48:32.120 --> 48:33.997
More. More.

48:34.081 --> 48:35.874
Can she be certain of the details?

48:35.958 --> 48:37.709
How could she be certain
of the details?

48:38.585 --> 48:41.421
Well, that’s a tough one.

48:41.505 --> 48:43.465
Victims of trauma sometimes remember

48:43.549 --> 48:45.259
the smallest details perfectly.

48:45.342 --> 48:48.220
<i>Other times they replay
the event in their mind</i>

48:48.303 --> 48:51.473
<i>so many times
it becomes confused.</i>

48:51.557 --> 48:54.268
The memory of a memory,
essentially.

48:54.351 --> 48:56.270
Very often the struggle to remember,

48:56.353 --> 48:58.021
to piece together the event,

48:58.105 --> 49:00.858
<i>becomes the central focus
of the victim’s life.</i>

49:00.941 --> 49:02.025
<i>In such cases,</i>

49:02.109 --> 49:04.319
it’s really impossible to tell.

49:38.854 --> 49:40.856
Why are you
taking care of him?

49:44.484 --> 49:45.485
Off.

49:54.077 --> 49:57.164
I need to talk to you, Lewis.
I have information that’ll help you,

49:57.247 --> 49:58.624
but I can only tell you, not her.

49:58.707 --> 50:01.084
You don’t
set the conditions here.

50:03.212 --> 50:05.756
- You gave him our names?
- It doesn’t matter.

50:05.839 --> 50:07.508
What do you mean?
Of course it matters.

50:07.591 --> 50:10.886
Lewis? I need to talk to you.
I have concrete information.

50:10.969 --> 50:13.180
- You said you want to know the truth.
- Tell me.

50:13.263 --> 50:15.599
Wait a minute. Say it.

50:15.682 --> 50:17.684
- Say it now!
- No! It’s about my family.

50:17.768 --> 50:20.103
She would use the information
and hurt them.

50:21.271 --> 50:24.316
You know it’s true.
I’ll tell it only to you.

50:32.491 --> 50:34.034
We said we were gonna
do things together.

50:34.117 --> 50:35.661
You torture him
when I’m not here?

50:35.744 --> 50:38.247
- You call that torture?
- Yeah, I do.

50:38.330 --> 50:40.040
I saw his file in the clinic.

50:40.123 --> 50:42.876
He was born in Switzerland.
He was born there.

50:42.960 --> 50:44.628
He took a new identity.

50:44.711 --> 50:46.380
You don’t know that.
How do you know that?

50:46.463 --> 50:49.675
You always do that! Doubting me.
And you’re letting him see it.

50:49.758 --> 50:51.093
How do you think
he will ever confess

50:51.176 --> 50:52.386
if he thinks you’re on his side?

50:52.469 --> 50:54.555
I told you not to touch him
when I’m not in the house!

50:54.638 --> 50:57.140
- I was waiting for you!
- We had a plan! No?

50:57.224 --> 50:59.560
We do things together.
Together!

51:07.276 --> 51:08.277
Stay here.

51:19.162 --> 51:20.747
What did you do to my wife?

51:21.790 --> 51:23.667
- Nothing.
- What did you do to my wife?

51:23.750 --> 51:26.170
Nothing.
I never met her before.

51:26.253 --> 51:28.839
Never. I was in Zürich
the whole war.

51:28.922 --> 51:30.883
I worked in
the Department of Transport.

51:30.966 --> 51:32.801
Building C of the ministry.
You can check it.

51:32.885 --> 51:34.845
Where’d you go
to elementary school?

51:36.388 --> 51:38.432
Uh... Alfred Beale on Linden.

51:38.515 --> 51:40.267
High school?

51:40.350 --> 51:43.020
The Gymnasium down the street.
<i>Sport und Wissenschaft.</i>

51:43.103 --> 51:45.272
Give me the names of
a few of your classmates.

51:45.355 --> 51:47.357
I don’t remem...

51:47.441 --> 51:50.235
Stefan, Jan, Hobie.

51:50.319 --> 51:53.363
You don’t remember the names
of people in your high school?

51:53.447 --> 51:54.948
Here’s who I went
to high school with:

51:55.032 --> 51:57.868
Caroline Beale,
Jack Holland, Ben Rubins.

51:57.951 --> 51:59.620
Okay, I can name more.
You want me to name more?

51:59.703 --> 52:02.039
Stefan’s last name was Fröhlich.

52:03.540 --> 52:04.791
Does it even matter?

52:34.571 --> 52:36.114
Officer Brouwer.

52:36.198 --> 52:37.699
- Jim.
- Hey, Maja.

52:37.783 --> 52:39.409
Can you give us
a minute?

52:40.327 --> 52:41.537
Sure. Sure.

52:41.620 --> 52:43.163
It’s about the other night.

52:44.289 --> 52:46.375
- What other night?
- I told the sheriff.

52:46.458 --> 52:47.793
I hope everything’s okay.

52:50.379 --> 52:51.713
Can we go inside?

52:53.006 --> 52:54.675
Sure. Sure.

53:00.973 --> 53:02.933
Who was your supervisor
when you were a clerk?

53:03.016 --> 53:04.810
A guy named Michael Nagel.

53:04.893 --> 53:05.894
Michael Nagel?

53:08.272 --> 53:10.357
How do I find Michael Nagel?
Where do I find him?

53:10.440 --> 53:11.859
Zürich, probably.

53:11.942 --> 53:13.026
- Probably?
- Yes.

53:13.110 --> 53:14.570
- Sure. Look it up.
- Okay.

53:16.071 --> 53:17.531
Michael Nagel.

53:21.410 --> 53:23.245
Michael Nagel.
Michael Nagel.

53:24.288 --> 53:26.748
Serves in
the transport department.

53:26.832 --> 53:28.417
- Building C.
- Building C.

53:29.918 --> 53:33.255
If I send him a picture of yours,
will he verify who you are?

53:33.338 --> 53:34.965
Your name and that you were
with him during the war?

53:35.048 --> 53:36.758
- I would think so, yes.
- You would think so?

53:36.842 --> 53:38.427
It was 15 years ago.

53:38.510 --> 53:40.429
You gonna kill me if he happened
to have forgotten me?

53:40.512 --> 53:43.098
Give me something concrete
or I’m going upstairs.

53:43.182 --> 53:45.684
Didn’t come home last night.
Didn’t show up at work this morning.

53:45.767 --> 53:47.769
We have reason to believe
there’s foul play.

53:47.853 --> 53:50.647
His name’s Thomas Steinmann,
and this is Rachel, his wife.

53:50.731 --> 53:51.732
Hello.

53:51.815 --> 53:53.650
They just moved
to Spruce recently.

53:53.734 --> 53:55.402
So Jim White here is telling me that

53:55.485 --> 53:58.322
the two of you heard
a weird scream for help last night.

53:58.405 --> 54:00.073
It was actually
early morning.

54:00.157 --> 54:02.868
Yeah, around 5:00 a.m.

54:02.951 --> 54:05.329
Something like that.
But like I said, when I heard it,

54:05.412 --> 54:08.373
it was like a real, "Help."
A real deep one.

54:08.457 --> 54:09.625
"Help!"

54:11.001 --> 54:14.713
Yeah, but it came
from down the street.

54:14.796 --> 54:17.257
I was in the bedroom.
I ran out.

54:17.341 --> 54:20.135
From the inside
it was hard to tell. Just the...

54:20.969 --> 54:22.137
general direction.

54:26.099 --> 54:28.519
...only remembers fragments.
She’s making things up.

54:28.602 --> 54:30.437
- She’s insane!
- Don’t talk about my wife like that.

54:30.521 --> 54:31.939
Don’t ever say that again!

54:32.022 --> 54:34.149
You were saying you had
something for me. Now say it! Say it.

54:34.233 --> 54:35.651
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Just say it!

54:35.734 --> 54:38.445
Is Lewis home?

54:38.529 --> 54:40.572
No, he’s at the office.
Do you need him?

54:40.656 --> 54:44.284
I have something for you.
Just calm down.

54:44.368 --> 54:48.247
I have a way for you to know that if you
release me, I can’t go to the police.

54:53.043 --> 54:56.421
When I came to the US,
I had a visa,

54:56.505 --> 54:59.049
and then I got naturalized
through my marriage to Rachel.

54:59.967 --> 55:01.718
But Rachel was still married

55:01.802 --> 55:03.470
to her first husband in Colorado.

55:04.513 --> 55:05.806
We didn’t tell anyone

55:05.889 --> 55:08.308
and got our marriage license
in Virginia.

55:08.392 --> 55:10.602
We knew we broke the law,
but we had no choice.

55:10.686 --> 55:12.688
It was the only way
for me to stay in the US.

55:12.771 --> 55:15.983
I’m telling you this
so you have something on me.

55:16.066 --> 55:18.318
If you release me,
I can’t go to the police.

55:18.402 --> 55:23.407
We falsified federal documents.
We lied under oath to a federal officer.

55:23.490 --> 55:26.410
My wife would go to jail. I’d be deported.
Our life would be destroyed.

55:29.663 --> 55:33.208
This is your guarantee that
I don’t go to the police, see?

55:37.129 --> 55:38.255
So...

55:38.338 --> 55:40.174
So why don’t you search
this street?

55:40.257 --> 55:41.508
We will in a couple days.

55:41.592 --> 55:43.760
We haven’t started
an official investigation yet.

55:45.971 --> 55:48.307
Okay, I got something.
He told me...

55:48.390 --> 55:49.474
Lewis?

55:50.184 --> 55:51.435
I thought you were out.

55:51.518 --> 55:54.771
Me too.
What are you doing home?

56:00.694 --> 56:01.737
I was...

56:02.654 --> 56:04.865
I was just cleaning
the basement.

56:04.948 --> 56:07.910
I was just telling Maja
about the screams from last night.

56:07.993 --> 56:09.620
Everybody’s kind of...

56:10.787 --> 56:13.332
Yeah. Yeah,
she told me about that.

56:13.415 --> 56:16.460
I... must’ve slept
right through it.

56:16.543 --> 56:18.420
Uh, this is Rachel Steinmann.

56:18.504 --> 56:21.340
- Her husband’s missing.
- Nice to meet you.

56:23.634 --> 56:24.635
Hello.

56:25.844 --> 56:27.179
The hell happen to you?

56:28.305 --> 56:30.307
Oh, this is...

56:40.609 --> 56:42.569
Okay. Uh...

56:42.653 --> 56:44.279
I think that’s all we need
for today.

56:45.614 --> 56:47.282
- Lewis.
- Ed.

56:47.366 --> 56:48.450
Jim.

56:52.829 --> 56:55.415
Katie really wants to see you
at the clinic.

56:55.499 --> 56:57.584
- Is tomorrow okay?
- Tomorrow? Yeah. Sure.

56:57.668 --> 56:58.919
Just tell her to stop by.

57:02.256 --> 57:03.298
Thank you.

57:06.093 --> 57:07.094
Bye, Jim.

57:13.308 --> 57:14.643
We’re gonna get caught.

57:21.316 --> 57:23.110
So that’s her.

57:23.193 --> 57:24.194
Yeah.

57:27.906 --> 57:29.366
She must know something.

57:32.286 --> 57:34.705
He couldn’t have hidden it
from her all these years.

57:34.788 --> 57:35.873
You did.

57:43.046 --> 57:44.089
I’m sorry.

57:46.967 --> 57:48.552
What did he give you?

57:48.635 --> 57:50.554
What?

57:50.637 --> 57:52.806
What was it he wanted
to tell only you?

57:57.394 --> 58:00.147
He told me about a clerk in Zürich.

58:02.441 --> 58:03.942
He said it was about his family.

58:04.026 --> 58:05.360
I told you what he said.

58:13.952 --> 58:18.207
Shh, shh, shh.

59:26.066 --> 59:28.402
- Rachel?
- Hello.

59:28.485 --> 59:31.613
Hi, I’m Maja.
You were at my house.

59:31.697 --> 59:33.574
Oh. Yes, of course. Yeah.

59:33.657 --> 59:34.992
How are you?

59:35.075 --> 59:37.744
I just wanted to come and say hi.
See if you need anything.

59:37.828 --> 59:40.163
You’re new here

59:40.247 --> 59:43.125
and your husband is a foreigner
in this country like me, so...

59:44.293 --> 59:45.878
Thanks for offering.

59:45.961 --> 59:48.172
How did you know
he was a foreigner?

59:48.255 --> 59:50.048
Oh, Officer Brouwer told me.

59:50.132 --> 59:52.509
He’s... German, right?

59:53.135 --> 59:54.511
Swiss.

59:56.763 --> 59:58.724
This is Patrick, by the way.

59:58.807 --> 01:00:00.767
- Hi, Patrick.
- Hi.

01:00:00.851 --> 01:00:02.477
I’m Rachel.
This is Annabel.

01:00:02.561 --> 01:00:04.313
Annabel,
come say hi to Patrick.

01:00:09.067 --> 01:00:10.527
Hi.

01:00:10.611 --> 01:00:12.905
- Hi.
- You like dogs?

01:00:12.988 --> 01:00:15.157
Why don’t you go
introduce Patrick to Max?

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.076
You wanna go
and say hi to the dog? Go.

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:21.288
He’s sweet.
He won’t bite.

01:00:22.956 --> 01:00:25.292
So... no news?

01:00:29.254 --> 01:00:30.923
Where are you from, Maja?

01:00:31.006 --> 01:00:32.549
I’m from Romania.

01:00:32.633 --> 01:00:35.302
I met my husband Lewis
after the war in Europe,

01:00:35.385 --> 01:00:37.763
and then we moved here together.

01:00:37.846 --> 01:00:39.431
Like us.

01:00:41.475 --> 01:00:42.559
Excuse me. I’m sorry.

01:00:43.393 --> 01:00:45.187
Hey, come here.

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:46.396
You’re okay.

01:00:49.024 --> 01:00:50.734
Come here.
You’re okay, buddy.

01:00:50.817 --> 01:00:53.570
Yeah. There you go.

01:00:53.654 --> 01:00:55.656
This is Tommy.
Say hi.

01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:57.074
Hi, Tommy.

01:00:58.367 --> 01:01:00.285
Yeah, there you go.
Hello!

01:01:01.203 --> 01:01:02.204
Hello.

01:01:05.207 --> 01:01:09.002
I was in communications.
Civilian volunteer division.

01:01:09.086 --> 01:01:12.756
It was part of the Marshall Plan
after the war.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.924
That’s where I met him.

01:01:14.842 --> 01:01:16.176
For me, it was an adventure.

01:01:17.636 --> 01:01:19.888
I just wanted to get away
from there.

01:01:19.972 --> 01:01:22.224
That’s what Thomas
always says.

01:01:22.307 --> 01:01:26.436
Sometimes I think that’s why
he was eager to marry so fast.

01:01:27.855 --> 01:01:29.314
You married fast?

01:01:29.398 --> 01:01:30.649
Very.

01:01:30.732 --> 01:01:33.151
He really wanted to
get out of Europe immediately.

01:01:33.819 --> 01:01:34.903
Why?

01:01:34.987 --> 01:01:37.698
I think for someone
that endured the war,

01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:39.283
just had had enough.

01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:42.744
He was in the war?

01:01:42.828 --> 01:01:44.997
I thought the Swiss
were neutral.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.876
Well, I think the violence
affected everyone there.

01:01:48.959 --> 01:01:51.503
He was a clerk in Zürich.

01:01:51.587 --> 01:01:54.590
The least heroic role
you could imagine.

01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:59.845
Do you wanna stay for dinner?

01:02:00.554 --> 01:02:02.347
I think the kids would like that.

01:02:03.098 --> 01:02:04.308
Go get it!

01:02:07.477 --> 01:02:09.938
...kids are gonna get it.

01:02:10.022 --> 01:02:12.107
The dog thought
the human was gonna get it.

01:02:12.191 --> 01:02:14.484
I... I think we have to
get back home.

01:02:33.253 --> 01:02:36.507
I went to see his wife today.
Rachel.

01:02:38.926 --> 01:02:40.260
Was that smart?

01:02:40.928 --> 01:02:42.971
That son of a bitch.

01:02:43.055 --> 01:02:45.474
He thinks he can
just put the past behind.

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.520
Start a new life and...

01:02:50.437 --> 01:02:51.855
have a nice family.

01:02:54.316 --> 01:02:56.818
You know what
I hate most about this?

01:02:56.902 --> 01:03:01.156
When I first saw him,
my instinct was to move.

01:03:02.658 --> 01:03:04.117
To run away.

01:03:06.203 --> 01:03:09.748
’Cause we moved...
we moved around a lot when I was a kid.

01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:14.545
The Romanians threw us
from one place to another.

01:03:16.547 --> 01:03:17.589
And that man just...

01:03:19.258 --> 01:03:22.928
suddenly comes here, and I should move.
I should move again.

01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:25.180
Why didn’t you tell me this?

01:03:25.264 --> 01:03:27.808
Why did you downplay
your heritage to me? Why?

01:03:32.855 --> 01:03:34.356
Being a Roma...

01:03:37.192 --> 01:03:38.527
was very hard.

01:03:41.947 --> 01:03:46.994
We were of the caste, the group,
of Roma that are craftsmen.

01:03:48.495 --> 01:03:52.416
Metal, wood, jewelry.

01:03:52.499 --> 01:03:56.628
That’s how me and my sister survived
in the camp, ’cause we were good at it.

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.883
You never told me about her.

01:04:01.884 --> 01:04:03.093
Miriah.

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:08.307
She was... three years younger.

01:04:12.477 --> 01:04:14.855
She was my everything.

01:04:14.938 --> 01:04:18.525
I had lots of brothers and sisters,
but she was my light.

01:04:23.822 --> 01:04:27.993
It was me and her
who were in the camp together.

01:04:29.077 --> 01:04:31.413
We survived
the whole war together.

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:36.877
And then...

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.839
it was only... the last days we...

01:04:55.812 --> 01:04:56.980
Lewis.

01:05:00.609 --> 01:05:02.110
Do I look like a...

01:05:04.821 --> 01:05:06.823
Do I look different to you now?

01:05:15.666 --> 01:05:16.792
Yes.

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:17.918
Yes?

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:23.131
And no.

01:05:25.717 --> 01:05:27.469
You’re different,
but I mean...

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.265
it’s you.

01:05:32.474 --> 01:05:35.394
I just need to get used to
this new person.

01:05:39.982 --> 01:05:41.525
And your past.

01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:48.156
All of a sudden,
your past is here too.

01:06:34.828 --> 01:06:37.331
It took me two hours
to figure out how it works.

01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:41.251
I’m not sleeping.

01:06:41.793 --> 01:06:42.878
Too worried.

01:06:44.213 --> 01:06:46.840
Maybe your husband
can prescribe something?

01:06:46.924 --> 01:06:49.843
I can get you sleeping pills.
I have lots at home.

01:06:49.927 --> 01:06:51.929
I have the same problem.

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.348
After the war.

01:06:58.852 --> 01:07:00.020
Thomas too.

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:10.531
You should really meet him
when he’s back.

01:07:10.614 --> 01:07:13.784
He’d be so happy to know
another European in this town, I’m sure.

01:07:16.328 --> 01:07:17.621
We’re very similar.

01:07:19.289 --> 01:07:21.583
You know, both of us
married Americans and...

01:07:22.584 --> 01:07:24.962
got out of there
as soon as possible.

01:07:34.596 --> 01:07:37.766
When you marry they say,
"Till death do you part,"

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:42.604
but you can never imagine
what that means, you know?

01:07:42.688 --> 01:07:44.189
Till death do us part.

01:07:50.237 --> 01:07:51.780
He’s not dead.

01:07:52.823 --> 01:07:53.949
I know it.

01:07:59.663 --> 01:08:01.164
That’s beautiful.

01:08:04.543 --> 01:08:05.669
Look inside.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.974
You’re Jewish?

01:08:19.057 --> 01:08:21.268
Yeah.

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:24.770
I have no idea how he got it made
in Europe at that time

01:08:24.854 --> 01:08:26.523
with everything that was going on.

01:08:27.566 --> 01:08:29.651
He got it for you
when you were still there?

01:08:29.734 --> 01:08:30.861
Yeah.

01:08:32.571 --> 01:08:34.156
It’s very beautiful.

01:08:43.665 --> 01:08:44.666
What?

01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:47.669
What have you done?

01:08:52.925 --> 01:08:56.178
You married a Jew right after the war
and took off to the States?

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.013
What?

01:08:58.095 --> 01:08:59.973
Where did you get her that ring?

01:09:00.057 --> 01:09:01.683
How do you know?

01:09:01.767 --> 01:09:04.435
Did you steal your ring
in a camp too?

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.812
Let’s see.

01:09:05.895 --> 01:09:07.898
You stay away from my family,
you crazy bitch!

01:09:26.332 --> 01:09:28.877
No. No, no.

01:09:36.385 --> 01:09:40.805
Is this another ring you stole in a camp,
you Nazi pig, huh?

01:09:40.889 --> 01:09:42.307
You stay away from my family.

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:44.017
Let me see your ring.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:46.478
No! Don’t touch me!

01:09:46.562 --> 01:09:47.604
Don’t touch me!

01:09:59.324 --> 01:10:01.118
Let’s see if you stole this ring too.

01:10:01.201 --> 01:10:03.495
I didn’t. I swear. I swear!

01:10:03.579 --> 01:10:05.372
Tell me who you are, Karl.

01:10:05.455 --> 01:10:06.915
What’s your last name?

01:10:06.999 --> 01:10:09.376
My name is Thomas Steinmann.
I’m not the man you think I am!

01:10:09.459 --> 01:10:10.544
No more lies!

01:10:10.627 --> 01:10:11.753
- I have no idea...
- Last chance!

01:10:11.837 --> 01:10:13.213
I just want to
go back to my family.

01:10:13.297 --> 01:10:15.591
- I want my sister back!
- It’s not me!

01:10:21.346 --> 01:10:23.432
You crazy, sadistic bitch!

01:10:30.314 --> 01:10:32.191
Maja?

01:10:32.274 --> 01:10:34.985
Maja?

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.696
- Maja?
- Who’s there?

01:10:39.198 --> 01:10:40.324
Lewis.

01:10:40.407 --> 01:10:42.784
You want to sleep
at Albert’s tonight? Good.

01:10:44.119 --> 01:10:46.371
Stay right here.
I’m gonna get your pajamas, okay?

01:10:46.955 --> 01:10:49.041
Lewis. Lewis.

01:10:51.293 --> 01:10:52.669
What’s that, Mommy?

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:59.301
It’s just some red paint.
Mommy’s okay.

01:10:59.384 --> 01:11:00.761
Let’s...

01:11:00.844 --> 01:11:02.137
Hey, I...

01:11:04.348 --> 01:11:06.183
Okay, go in the room
and stay there.

01:11:06.266 --> 01:11:07.893
Don’t move.
Don’t come out.

01:11:10.812 --> 01:11:12.648
Lewis. Lewis, look.

01:11:12.731 --> 01:11:14.149
Look. Do you see?

01:11:14.233 --> 01:11:16.235
- What happened?
- Do you understand what this means?

01:11:18.445 --> 01:11:21.532
Lewis, look. His ring.
It’s a Jewish star.

01:11:21.615 --> 01:11:23.659
Like his wife, but he’s not Jewish.
Do you understand?

01:11:23.742 --> 01:11:25.327
He stole it
like all the other Nazis.

01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:27.412
No, I did it for my wife.
It meant a lot to her.

01:11:27.496 --> 01:11:28.664
Do you understand
what this means?

01:11:28.747 --> 01:11:30.874
- She wanted me to.
- Lewis, are you listening to me?

01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:32.751
I did it for my wife.

01:11:32.835 --> 01:11:35.546
What are you doing? Why are you
helping him? Lewis, listen to me.

01:11:35.629 --> 01:11:36.630
Enough!

01:11:38.799 --> 01:11:40.634
Coward!

01:11:40.717 --> 01:11:42.719
- Stop helping him! Why are you helping?
- I said that’s enough.

01:11:42.803 --> 01:11:44.054
That’s enough!

01:14:00.274 --> 01:14:01.900
<i>I know exactly...</i>

01:14:03.944 --> 01:14:08.282
<i>I know exactly how it feels
to hold a secret that long.</i>

01:14:11.243 --> 01:14:12.744
<i>The fear of letting it out.</i>

01:14:17.165 --> 01:14:18.625
<i>Karl.</i>

01:14:20.127 --> 01:14:22.254
There was always a part of me

01:14:22.337 --> 01:14:24.590
that was eager to let it out.

01:14:25.924 --> 01:14:27.050
Always.

01:14:31.388 --> 01:14:33.390
And I know you have that too.

01:14:35.809 --> 01:14:37.102
I know you do.

01:14:38.478 --> 01:14:40.314
I can see it.

01:14:57.831 --> 01:14:59.416
Give me what I want, Karl.

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.587
Do it for your family.

01:15:05.464 --> 01:15:07.090
For Annabel and Tommy.

01:15:10.219 --> 01:15:12.179
If you do, I will let you go.

01:15:17.142 --> 01:15:19.228
It’s your only way out of here.

01:15:21.438 --> 01:15:22.981
You believe me, right?

01:15:29.488 --> 01:15:31.657
You know it’s your only way out.

01:15:34.701 --> 01:15:35.702
Yes.

01:15:37.996 --> 01:15:40.040
If you die here,

01:15:40.123 --> 01:15:41.959
who will take care of your children?

01:15:43.252 --> 01:15:45.087
Will you really
do this to them?

01:15:46.296 --> 01:15:47.881
Yes. I will kill you.

01:16:32.342 --> 01:16:33.635
How’s Patrick?

01:16:36.555 --> 01:16:37.764
He’s okay.

01:16:39.016 --> 01:16:40.350
He’s a strong kid.

01:16:45.105 --> 01:16:47.733
Albert’s niece is there,
so he’s good.

01:16:53.238 --> 01:16:54.990
I was afraid
you wouldn’t come back.

01:17:10.047 --> 01:17:12.132
We have to put an end to this.

01:17:16.887 --> 01:17:17.930
Listen.

01:17:22.935 --> 01:17:25.395
I got confirmation from Switzerland.

01:17:25.479 --> 01:17:27.356
His story checks out.
He was really there.

01:17:28.398 --> 01:17:29.441
He was there.

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:35.948
And...

01:17:38.867 --> 01:17:40.410
I talked to Dr. Nussbaum.

01:17:40.494 --> 01:17:44.373
And he said that in cases like this,
people can get confused.

01:17:44.456 --> 01:17:46.333
- Lewis, please.
- It’s natural.

01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:49.336
- No, it’s possible.
- You just want this to go away.

01:17:53.465 --> 01:17:57.135
Thomas told me that his marriage
was based on false information.

01:17:57.219 --> 01:18:01.223
When they met in Europe, she was
still married to another man in Colorado.

01:18:02.975 --> 01:18:04.518
When did he say this?

01:18:04.601 --> 01:18:07.062
When you were upstairs,
and I was alone with him.

01:18:07.145 --> 01:18:08.397
You didn’t tell me this.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.650
He gave it to me
so that we have something on him.

01:18:11.733 --> 01:18:14.653
We can release him and know
he won’t go to the police.

01:18:18.699 --> 01:18:20.450
We can get out of this, Maja.

01:18:21.827 --> 01:18:23.579
Get our lives back to normal.

01:18:25.289 --> 01:18:27.207
My life will never be normal.

01:18:33.630 --> 01:18:35.132
Can’t we move on...

01:18:36.717 --> 01:18:38.385
and put it behind us?

01:18:40.262 --> 01:18:41.889
Even if it is him.

01:18:44.683 --> 01:18:48.478
Can you forgive... for our sake?

01:18:49.646 --> 01:18:52.608
Please? For our sake.

01:19:06.288 --> 01:19:08.123
What do you want?

01:19:12.503 --> 01:19:14.254
What do you want?

01:19:17.674 --> 01:19:19.885
I want him to confess.

01:19:19.968 --> 01:19:21.261
Why?

01:19:21.345 --> 01:19:24.598
If you’re so sure it’s him, why?

01:19:27.726 --> 01:19:29.937
I need you to hear it.

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.398
- I don’t need to hear it.
- Yes, you do.

01:19:33.482 --> 01:19:35.067
I don’t need to hear it.

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:37.986
Imagine all this ending,
and you’re still not sure.

01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:41.198
You’d always think I’m crazy,
and that I attacked an innocent man.

01:19:41.281 --> 01:19:43.116
- I won’t.
- Yes, you will.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.160
Maybe not today or tomorrow,

01:19:45.244 --> 01:19:49.414
but if this stays unresolved,
you won’t be able to live with it.

01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:53.961
I know you, Lewis.

01:20:25.617 --> 01:20:26.702
Hi, sweetie.

01:20:28.579 --> 01:20:29.746
You okay?

01:20:30.998 --> 01:20:32.332
What’s wrong? Hey.

01:20:34.668 --> 01:20:35.878
What’s wrong?

01:20:37.713 --> 01:20:39.464
I just wish Dad was here.

01:20:44.845 --> 01:20:48.223
Uh... Daddy will be back
in a few days.

01:20:48.307 --> 01:20:49.558
Okay?

01:20:49.641 --> 01:20:51.435
Do you know
what he told me?

01:20:51.518 --> 01:20:54.897
He told me he bought you and Tommy
a really special present.

01:20:57.316 --> 01:20:59.484
Don’t be rude.
Go play with Patrick, okay?

01:21:12.206 --> 01:21:16.543
You know, Rachel, what you just did...
out there right now.

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:21.507
I do that to Patrick all the time.

01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:23.258
Ever since he was born.

01:21:24.593 --> 01:21:26.345
I lie to him.

01:21:26.428 --> 01:21:29.932
I lie to him when he...
when he asks about my family,

01:21:30.015 --> 01:21:32.059
what happened to them in the war.

01:21:35.479 --> 01:21:38.899
I even lie to him about who I am.

01:21:38.982 --> 01:21:42.736
I... I feel like I’m protecting him, but...

01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:51.495
He asks me all these questions,
and I don’t know what to say.

01:21:52.663 --> 01:21:53.872
Annabel does the same.

01:21:53.956 --> 01:21:56.250
It’s okay, I don’t know
what to tell her either.

01:21:58.794 --> 01:21:59.920
Why not?

01:22:04.091 --> 01:22:05.926
Thomas doesn’t
talk about his family.

01:22:07.761 --> 01:22:08.804
Why?

01:22:09.847 --> 01:22:10.848
I don’t know.

01:22:12.683 --> 01:22:15.435
I’ve realized the past few days there’s...

01:22:16.728 --> 01:22:20.148
so much that I don’t know
about Thomas.

01:22:20.232 --> 01:22:24.236
I’m filling out these forms,
these police forms. I...

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:30.742
I have nobody to call
to say he’s missing.

01:22:30.826 --> 01:22:33.871
His family in Europe, I don’t...

01:22:33.954 --> 01:22:37.916
Just even to ask if he’s ever
done anything like this before

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.252
or just to talk.

01:22:40.335 --> 01:22:44.131
I’ve tried to ask questions about
his family, but he doesn’t like it.

01:22:44.214 --> 01:22:47.092
His past or it’s these nightmares.
He just explodes.

01:22:47.176 --> 01:22:50.637
I don’t understand why
he has nightmares in the first place.

01:22:50.721 --> 01:22:52.514
He wasn’t even in the war.

01:22:55.517 --> 01:22:57.102
Sometimes I look at him...

01:22:58.437 --> 01:23:00.230
I don’t talk about this,

01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:02.482
so if you’d...

01:23:02.566 --> 01:23:06.236
Could you please just not repeat
what I’m saying to you?

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.321
Yeah.

01:23:19.416 --> 01:23:21.710
I had to lie to Rachel.

01:23:21.793 --> 01:23:24.588
It was to protect her
and the children.

01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:28.425
Many Germans did it after the war.
They lied about being German.

01:23:28.509 --> 01:23:31.094
I wouldn’t have even been able
to emigrate to this country otherwise.

01:23:32.346 --> 01:23:34.515
I was in the army.

01:23:34.598 --> 01:23:38.018
I was in the army,
but I never met you.

01:23:38.101 --> 01:23:39.520
Just stop.

01:23:39.603 --> 01:23:41.647
Your wife told me enough.

01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:44.066
If you keep lying to me,
you will die here.

01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:46.818
If you tell me the truth,
you can go home.

01:23:46.902 --> 01:23:49.530
You can have breakfast
with Annabel and Tommy tomorrow.

01:23:50.656 --> 01:23:52.574
I don’t want to kill you.

01:23:52.658 --> 01:23:54.868
But you have to stop lying to me.

01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:04.545
We were sleeping
in that old, empty building.

01:24:06.338 --> 01:24:07.798
My sister was
being dragged away.

01:24:09.007 --> 01:24:11.009
<i>Two men were holding me down.</i>

01:24:11.093 --> 01:24:12.886
Someone was pouring
alcohol on me.

01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:15.138
My eyes were burning,
and I couldn’t see.

01:24:21.478 --> 01:24:22.855
<i>I remember that I was running.</i>

01:24:22.938 --> 01:24:25.190
I was running, but I don’t know if...

01:24:26.567 --> 01:24:30.237
<i>Did I leave her there?</i>

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.406
I know you were there.
You have to tell me.

01:24:33.991 --> 01:24:37.202
Why do you have nightmares, Karl?

01:24:37.286 --> 01:24:40.789
What do you see in your nightmares?
Do you see my face?

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.041
Do you see my sister?

01:24:43.125 --> 01:24:45.752
- Karl!
- Do you see me run away?

01:24:48.297 --> 01:24:49.756
Karl.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.258
Karl, look at me.

01:24:51.341 --> 01:24:54.136
I don’t want to shoot you, but I will.

01:24:54.219 --> 01:24:56.597
If you don’t tell me what you know,
I will kill you.

01:24:57.347 --> 01:24:58.807
Did I leave her?

01:24:58.891 --> 01:25:01.602
Did I leave her there? Did I...
Did I run away from her?

01:25:01.685 --> 01:25:04.271
Did I run away? Did I run away?

01:25:06.273 --> 01:25:08.025
Did I run away?

01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:11.361
Did I run away?

01:25:11.445 --> 01:25:13.697
- Did I run away?
- We shot everyone.

01:25:14.698 --> 01:25:16.450
We must have just missed you.

01:25:16.533 --> 01:25:19.578
There were... Russians were nearby.
We had to leave quickly.

01:25:23.749 --> 01:25:27.127
Rachel and the children,
they must never know.

01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:30.172
They will never know.

01:25:30.255 --> 01:25:33.300
When I saw you
the first time, I thought you...

01:25:33.383 --> 01:25:34.468
I thought you were dead.

01:25:34.551 --> 01:25:36.845
Dieter was undressing you.

01:25:42.476 --> 01:25:44.144
Did I run away?

01:25:46.146 --> 01:25:47.272
You never left.

01:25:48.398 --> 01:25:50.025
I never left.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.364
Some people
didn’t even resist.

01:25:56.532 --> 01:25:59.910
I managed to not think of it
for... a long time.

01:25:59.993 --> 01:26:01.828
But it kept coming back.

01:26:03.622 --> 01:26:07.459
That horrible feeling.
It was like living inside a nightmare.

01:26:07.543 --> 01:26:08.919
All the amphetamines...

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.297
I didn’t sleep for... five nights.

01:26:13.841 --> 01:26:17.010
The year before,
I was in high school.

01:26:17.094 --> 01:26:19.847
I don’t understand how
I could become that person.

01:26:19.930 --> 01:26:21.849
I don’t understand how I could do that.

01:26:23.684 --> 01:26:25.477
How I could do those things.

01:26:32.442 --> 01:26:34.820
I don’t recognize...

01:26:34.903 --> 01:26:38.282
I don’t recognize that person
that I was 15 years ago.

01:26:38.365 --> 01:26:40.701
I don’t recognize him,
but I know I did it.

01:26:49.918 --> 01:26:50.919
I did it.

01:27:06.435 --> 01:27:07.936
What did you...

01:27:15.277 --> 01:27:16.528
What did you do?

01:27:35.088 --> 01:27:36.590
What have you done?

01:28:37.442 --> 01:28:38.652
Lewis?

01:28:58.964 --> 01:29:00.090
Hey.

01:29:05.888 --> 01:29:07.890
I don’t know how to do this.

01:29:10.142 --> 01:29:11.560
I can’t do it.

01:29:12.394 --> 01:29:14.938
- I can’t do it.
- Yes, you can.

01:29:15.898 --> 01:29:17.065
Yes, you can.

01:29:19.276 --> 01:29:22.321
This is done. This is over.

01:29:23.739 --> 01:29:26.450
We must never
talk about this again.

01:29:26.533 --> 01:29:27.618
To anyone.

01:29:34.416 --> 01:29:35.459
Lewis.

01:29:36.710 --> 01:29:38.420
You’re a good man.

01:29:44.009 --> 01:29:48.680
You asked me to find a way
to let go, to forgive.

01:29:48.764 --> 01:29:49.932
I couldn’t.

01:29:50.933 --> 01:29:52.267
I didn’t.

01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:57.940
You told me you didn’t need
to hear what happened.

01:29:58.023 --> 01:29:59.691
And I didn’t listen to you.

01:30:03.028 --> 01:30:05.030
And now we’re here together.

01:30:06.657 --> 01:30:08.408
And we move on together.

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.373
Lewis, look at me. Look at me.

01:30:19.878 --> 01:30:21.755
You go to work.

01:30:21.839 --> 01:30:24.883
I’ll go to Albert’s.
I pick up Patrick.

01:30:24.967 --> 01:30:26.385
Take him to school.

01:30:28.345 --> 01:30:29.555
We move on.

01:30:50.158 --> 01:30:52.911
Good to see you, buddy. Happy Fourth.

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:58.959
Okay, I already took it.

01:30:59.042 --> 01:31:01.044
You guys can put it on your side.

01:31:22.357 --> 01:31:25.152
Jimmy.
Jimmy, come here.
