00:00.234 --> 00:02.381
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:02.406 --> 00:03.936
What is happening
to our family?

00:03.961 --> 00:05.504
Mom, getting kicked out
of the church.

00:05.504 --> 00:07.590
Georgie having a baby
out of wedlock.

00:07.590 --> 00:09.717
We really are white trash.

00:09.717 --> 00:11.886
But the church is still
your family.

00:11.886 --> 00:14.889
I'd just hate to see you
walk away from the Lord.

00:14.889 --> 00:18.768
Feels like
he's walking away from me.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.135
You looking for
a new church?

00:26.135 --> 00:27.511
Not yet.

00:27.511 --> 00:29.305
'Cause I can see you
going Catholic.

00:29.305 --> 00:32.391
You got a "get thee
to a nunnery" vibe.

00:33.851 --> 00:36.103
Oh. Mom. Really?

00:36.103 --> 00:37.772
Passion's Harvest?

00:37.772 --> 00:41.108
The main character's name
is Passion.

00:41.108 --> 00:43.569
She's inherited
her daddy's farm,

00:43.569 --> 00:46.614
and there's a stud
in the stable.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.491
Oh, that's terrible.

00:48.491 --> 00:51.869
Read it, then tell me
how terrible it is.

00:51.869 --> 00:53.496
I'm not reading this trash.

00:53.496 --> 00:55.831
So you're literally judging
a book by its cover?

00:57.208 --> 00:58.584
All right.

00:58.584 --> 01:00.377
Fine. I'll give it a look.

01:01.420 --> 01:03.589
How come you've dog-eared
all these pages?

01:03.589 --> 01:05.591

01:25.402 --> 01:29.907
Ethically, can science
ever go too far?

01:29.907 --> 01:32.743
Just because we can
do something,

01:32.743 --> 01:34.829
does that mean
we should do something?

01:34.829 --> 01:36.413
Yes.

01:36.413 --> 01:37.998
I haven't finished.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.501
I'm sorry, go on. Ethically,

01:40.501 --> 01:43.629
should science have
any limitations?

01:43.629 --> 01:44.839
No.

01:44.839 --> 01:46.757
Interesting.

01:46.757 --> 01:49.176
What about human cloning?

01:49.176 --> 01:51.178
More of me? Yes, please.

01:51.178 --> 01:53.430
Well, what about more of
everyone else?

01:54.598 --> 01:56.058
No, thank you.

01:56.058 --> 01:57.935
What about, uh, dinosaurs?

01:57.935 --> 02:00.521
Herbivores, yes.
Carnivores, no.

02:00.521 --> 02:04.066
Well, what about the herbivores
who can squash you like a bug?

02:04.066 --> 02:06.777
Good point. No dinosaurs.

02:06.777 --> 02:09.572
So, cloning is unethical?

02:09.572 --> 02:11.031
Right.

02:11.031 --> 02:13.033
But what if we were
to clone Albert Einstein?

02:13.033 --> 02:14.577
That would be swell.

02:14.577 --> 02:16.370
At some point,
I'm going to need a sidekick.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.038
So, cloning is ethical?

02:18.038 --> 02:19.999
Right, because Albert Einstein,
unlike the dinosaur,

02:19.999 --> 02:21.458
harmed no one.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.711
I think the victims
of the atomic bomb,

02:23.711 --> 02:27.590
which his discoveries
helped create, might disagree.

02:27.590 --> 02:29.592
So, what's the right answer?

02:29.592 --> 02:33.387
That's why we're here,
to find that out.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.680
Why don't you just tell us?

02:34.680 --> 02:36.682
Why don't you?
I asked you first.

02:36.682 --> 02:38.100
You're it, no backsies.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.981

03:22.227 --> 03:24.146
Hey.

03:24.146 --> 03:25.940
What are you doing here?

03:25.940 --> 03:28.692
I was at the grocery store and
I picked some things up for you.

03:29.652 --> 03:31.987
Thanks, but I can buy
my own groceries.

03:31.987 --> 03:33.906
I know,
but you're eating for two.

03:33.906 --> 03:35.491
I thought I should help out.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.161

03:39.161 --> 03:41.205

pregnant ladies like those.

03:41.205 --> 03:43.582
Okay, I'm throwing up enough
as it is.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.002
Why is it so dark in there?

03:47.002 --> 03:48.754
No reason.

03:48.754 --> 03:50.714
What's with the candles?
Are you on a date?

03:50.714 --> 03:52.800
You think I'd dress like this
on a date?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.301
I think you look good.

03:54.301 --> 03:55.886
Well, I don't,
and if I was on a date,

03:55.886 --> 03:57.179
it'd be none of your business.

03:57.179 --> 03:59.765
Then why are you
sitting in the dark?

04:01.433 --> 04:03.060
Okay. It's not a big deal.

04:03.060 --> 04:04.812
I was a little short
on the power bill this month.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.730
How come?

04:06.730 --> 04:08.440
Well, waiting tables
and morning sickness,

04:08.440 --> 04:09.942
not a great combination.

04:09.942 --> 04:11.694
Definitely got reflected
in my tips.

04:12.695 --> 04:14.488
Don't worry.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.156
I'll pay to get
your power turned back on.

04:16.156 --> 04:19.326
I'm not a charity case.
I can figure this out on my own.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.661
But you can't even watch TV.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.538
What kind of life is that?
It's fine.

04:22.538 --> 04:24.665
I can hear the neighbors fight.
That's almost as good as TV.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.292
Hmm. Well,
I'll leave you with this.

04:27.292 --> 04:28.669
There's some ice cream in there.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.837
You might want to
make that a priority.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.131
Okay. Good night.

04:32.131 --> 04:33.674
I got you the kind
with three different flavors

04:33.674 --> 04:35.175

what you liked.

she knew she looked good.

04:49.356 --> 04:52.026

Why not?

05:52.669 --> 05:54.713

of any ethical argument

05:54.713 --> 05:56.090
and present it.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.800

But I want to
take the right side.

06:04.431 --> 06:07.059
Maybe there is no right side.

06:07.059 --> 06:10.270
This is torture,
and that can't be ethical.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.523

You picked a subject.

06:12.523 --> 06:13.982
And a side.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.735
Oh. Good.
Torture is unethical.

06:16.735 --> 06:18.403
That's clearly
the correct position.

06:18.403 --> 06:20.447
I agree.

06:20.447 --> 06:21.949
But what if there's a bomb

06:23.784 --> 06:28.122
and someone says that the only
way to find out its location

06:28.122 --> 06:29.706
is through torture?

06:29.706 --> 06:30.999
Answer that.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.292
Let's see.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.919
Batman plays
by Gotham City rules

06:33.919 --> 06:36.213
and would use torture,
but Superman's got

06:36.213 --> 06:37.548
those Midwest values.

06:37.548 --> 06:39.383

Guess we'll have to make

06:56.718 --> 06:58.845
I guess so.

06:58.845 --> 07:00.722
What do you say...

07:00.722 --> 07:02.807
we get out of here?

07:02.807 --> 07:05.310
What do you have in mind?

07:05.310 --> 07:06.644
I don't know.

07:06.644 --> 07:09.272
I was thinking
maybe we take a walk.

08:02.033 --> 08:03.994
I was also short on the rent,

08:03.994 --> 08:06.913

09:06.885 --> 09:08.470
Yeah, he asked for help.

Yep.

09:10.847 --> 09:12.974
How long have you known him?
All my life.

09:12.974 --> 09:14.934

No.

09:14.934 --> 09:16.561
Hello.
Hang on.

09:16.561 --> 09:18.146
Is this some kind of prank?

09:18.146 --> 09:20.273
It's not a prank. I just
need help with my homework.

No.

09:23.276 --> 09:25.070
Is it real heavy?
You need help lifting it?

09:25.070 --> 09:27.238
No, I need your opinion
on an ethical dilemma.

09:27.238 --> 09:29.616
Should robots have
the same rights as humans?

09:29.616 --> 09:31.493
That depends.

09:31.493 --> 09:33.119
What's "ethical" mean?

09:47.425 --> 09:50.095
Don't shoot!

'Cause I can go slower.

09:58.436 --> 10:00.647

10:04.359 --> 10:06.194
I'm in the wrong apartment.

10:06.194 --> 10:07.904
I just said that.

10:07.904 --> 10:09.614
I can explain.

10:09.614 --> 10:11.282
My girlfriend-- well,
she's not really my girlfriend,

10:11.282 --> 10:12.951
but she's having my baby.

10:12.951 --> 10:14.369
She got evicted,

10:14.369 --> 10:16.204
and I came to get her stuff.

Yes.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.460
You're the dumb bastard
that knocked her up?

10:22.460 --> 10:25.547
Yes, that's me!
Not a robber, dumb bastard!

10:25.547 --> 10:28.007
Aw, hell.

10:28.007 --> 10:30.385
Put your hands down.

10:30.385 --> 10:32.554
I ain't gonna shoot you.

10:36.307 --> 10:38.309
I saw the padlock on her door.

10:38.309 --> 10:41.479
Yeah, and all her stuff's
in there.

10:41.479 --> 10:42.897
I came to get it for her.

10:42.897 --> 10:44.691
I like that girl.

10:44.691 --> 10:46.192
She's a good one.

10:46.192 --> 10:47.569
I agree.

10:47.569 --> 10:49.154
Why don't you marry her?

10:49.154 --> 10:50.905
I'm trying. She don't want to.

10:50.905 --> 10:54.742
So, you think getting her
toothbrush's gonna change that?

10:55.702 --> 10:57.078
Couldn't hurt.

10:58.204 --> 10:59.956
So, what do you say, can I go?

10:59.956 --> 11:01.374
Yeah.

11:01.374 --> 11:03.168
Thank you, sir.
Good night, sir.

11:03.168 --> 11:05.086
Sorry to bother you, sir.

11:05.086 --> 11:07.547
Nice kid.

11:09.090 --> 11:11.009
Glad I didn't kill him.

11:13.768 --> 11:17.146
Sometimes I feel like,
at my age,

11:17.146 --> 11:18.939
I should have
everything all figured out.

11:18.939 --> 11:21.108
But I don't.

11:21.108 --> 11:23.778
Nobody has it all figured out.

11:23.778 --> 11:25.946
You ever get scared?

11:25.946 --> 11:28.491
Oh, yeah.
All the time.

11:28.491 --> 11:31.660
I mean, like right now, I...

11:31.660 --> 11:33.996
I'm scared you won't like me.

11:33.996 --> 11:35.748
Oh, Dusty.

11:37.458 --> 11:40.336
You don't have to
worry about that.

11:40.336 --> 11:42.505
You promise?

11:42.505 --> 11:45.591
With God as my witness.

11:45.591 --> 11:48.803
Well, I hope he's not watching
right now,

11:48.803 --> 11:50.805
'cause I'm about to kiss you.

11:52.473 --> 11:53.808
What you writing?

11:53.808 --> 11:57.228
Oh. Uh,
just making a list of chores

11:57.228 --> 11:59.146
that need to get done.

11:59.146 --> 12:01.649
Well, that doesn't
sound like fun.

12:01.649 --> 12:03.359
Well...

12:03.359 --> 12:05.528
one of them is.

12:05.528 --> 12:07.363
I'll get to the rain gutters.

12:07.363 --> 12:08.697
You just got to...

12:10.032 --> 12:11.367
Mm. Mmm.

12:11.367 --> 12:13.160
What's happening?

12:13.160 --> 12:15.663
Why don't you come
to the bedroom and find out?

12:18.290 --> 12:19.834
Weird day.

12:19.834 --> 12:21.168
Did you have any problems

12:21.168 --> 12:22.628
getting into the apartment?

12:22.628 --> 12:24.255
No.

12:24.255 --> 12:25.756
In the right window,
out the right window.

12:25.756 --> 12:26.924
Easy peasy.

12:28.175 --> 12:30.136
You can hang your dresses
and whatnot on the barbell.

12:30.136 --> 12:31.554
Fancy.

12:31.554 --> 12:34.431
So we're clear, uh,

12:34.431 --> 12:36.642
just 'cause we're
sleeping together

12:36.642 --> 12:39.186
doesn't mean we're...
"sleeping" together.

12:39.186 --> 12:40.980
I understand.

12:40.980 --> 12:42.523
If you want, you can take the
bed and I'll sleep on the floor.

12:42.523 --> 12:44.525
Oh, I can't ask you to do that.

12:44.525 --> 12:47.111
It's okay. I got a sleeping bag,
and I'm young.

12:48.070 --> 12:50.865
We'll share the bed, just, uh,
keep your hands to yourself.

12:50.865 --> 12:53.659
Works both ways.
You keep your hands to yourself.

12:53.659 --> 12:55.369
I'll manage.

12:55.369 --> 12:57.538
Well, if you find you can't,
that's okay, too.

12:57.538 --> 12:59.915
Hey, uh, what's
the bathroom situation?

12:59.915 --> 13:02.001
Oh, I pay rent. You can use
the one in the house.

13:02.001 --> 13:04.587
Good, I was afraid
you were gonna say that sink.

13:05.963 --> 13:07.381
The sink?

13:07.381 --> 13:08.716
That's kind of gross.

13:08.716 --> 13:10.384
I'll be right back.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.349
Looks like
you're just a sink again.

13:22.730 --> 13:23.981
Oh, George.

13:23.981 --> 13:25.399
Mm, you like that?

13:25.399 --> 13:26.942
I love that.

13:26.942 --> 13:28.152
How about
we turn the lights off?

13:28.152 --> 13:29.403
Yes, please.

13:29.403 --> 13:30.446
Tickles!

13:30.446 --> 13:32.323
Get out. Get out.

13:32.323 --> 13:33.324
What?

13:33.324 --> 13:34.575
I'm using the sink.

13:34.575 --> 13:36.243
Sweet.

13:40.872 --> 13:42.505
Good morning. Morning.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.115
Did someone have a sleepover?

13:44.115 --> 13:46.617
Mandy's gonna be staying with me
for a little bit.

13:46.617 --> 13:47.910
Mm-hmm.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.036
It's not like that.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.497
Didn't say it was.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.791
Go ahead and take a seat, I'll
make you some scrambled eggs.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.418
Since when do you make eggs?

13:55.418 --> 13:56.627
I can make eggs.

13:56.627 --> 13:57.920
He can't make eggs.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.171
Actually,
my stomach's a little queasy.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.423
How about just some toast?

14:00.423 --> 14:02.133
Great. Toast, I can do.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.635
Good morning, everyone.

14:04.635 --> 14:05.886
Niblingo.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.555
I'm sorry, what?

14:07.555 --> 14:09.265
It's an honorific
I came up with to

14:09.265 --> 14:11.726
describe a woman who's carrying
my future niece or nephew

14:11.726 --> 14:13.602
but is not related to me by law.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.354
You remember Sheldon.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.480
I do.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.523
Yeah.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.816
I'm glad you're here.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.192
I have a question
about robot ethics

14:20.192 --> 14:21.360
I was hoping
you could help me with.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.737
Sheldon,
leave her alone.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.947
No, it's okay,
he can ask me a question.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.783
I'm his, uh... What am I?

14:27.783 --> 14:30.453
Niblingo.
Niblingo. What's your question?

14:30.453 --> 14:33.205
Ethically, should a robot
be programmed to never kill,

14:33.205 --> 14:34.957
even if killing
would save lives?

14:34.957 --> 14:36.751
Where's the dang toaster?

14:36.751 --> 14:38.961
Welcome to breakfast
at our house.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.264
Fire!

14:50.264 --> 14:52.725
What? What? Where?

14:52.725 --> 14:55.227
You know, thanks
for keeping an eye on things.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.270
Sorry.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.105
I didn't get much sleep.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.774
Oh, you and Mary fighting again?

14:59.774 --> 15:02.068
Oh, no, we're getting
along real good.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.110
Okay.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.446
I mean... real good.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.656
Yeah. I-I said okay.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.116
It's like she's
a different person.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.243
That reminds me of a film.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.371
A lady fell off a boat,
she hit her head,

15:14.371 --> 15:17.917
and when she woke up, she was
a completely different person.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.752
What's your point?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.253
Did Mary fall off a boat
recently?

15:21.253 --> 15:23.255
Not that I know of.
Well, you should ask her.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.924
We're not boat people, Dale.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.302
Something strange is going on
in the bedroom.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.512
Uh-huh.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.138
I mean, I'm happy about it.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.973
You know,
it's actually pretty great.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.558
I just...

15:34.558 --> 15:36.143
I don't understand why.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.563
See, now I'm with you there.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.023
When I was married to June,

15:41.023 --> 15:42.691
she was going through
the change. Hmm.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.069
She became downright frisky.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.154
I think Mary's a little young
for the change.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.280
Well, you'd think.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.907
Nature's curious.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.118
I went to school with a kid
whose hair turned gray

15:52.118 --> 15:53.911
in the tenth grade.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.539
We called him Whitey. Clever.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.749
He used to buy us liquor.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.835
Oh, anyway,

16:00.835 --> 16:02.336
what I'm saying is that

16:02.336 --> 16:04.547
have the family medic
do a once-over on her.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.757
You know, kick the tires,
see how she's rolling.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.300
Yeah, thanks, Dale.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.885
I tell you my wife wants
to have sex with me,

16:09.885 --> 16:11.303
you tell me
she needs to see a doctor.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.888
Well, I'm sorry.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.975
You making a woman hot,
that's completely normal.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.858
Hey.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.151
I thought you were working.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.278
Oh, I'm on lunch break.

16:27.278 --> 16:28.487
Brought you something to eat.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.823
Oh, thank you.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.741
Oh, I also got you
some ginger ale for your tummy.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.245
Why do you look
like you're gonna cry?

16:37.496 --> 16:39.039
'Cause I am.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.749
What's wrong?

16:40.749 --> 16:43.461
My whole life.

16:43.461 --> 16:47.047
A year ago, I was a TV
weather girl in San Antonio,

16:47.047 --> 16:49.592
and now I'm living in a garage
with the 17-year-old

16:49.592 --> 16:50.843
who got me pregnant.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.595
I'll be 18
before you know it.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.263
But not before you're a father!

16:54.263 --> 16:56.891
Okay, well, what can I do?

16:56.891 --> 16:59.143
Nothing, you're doing great.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.728
That's how screwed up
my life is right now,

17:00.728 --> 17:02.438
you're the best part of it.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.357
Thank you.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.984
I'm really trying.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.070
I know you are.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.364
It's gonna be okay.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.867
Is it?

17:14.867 --> 17:18.454
I peed in the sink last night.

17:19.413 --> 17:22.082
Trust me, I'll fix this.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.793
Now, here's the guest room.

17:24.793 --> 17:27.588
Make yourself at home.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.839
Thank you so much.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.799
It's only temporary,
I promise.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.218
Oh, no problem.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.385
Stay as long as you need.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.762
Bathroom's right down the hall.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.972
Oh, boy, a bathroom.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.807
I'll go get
the rest of your stuff.

17:38.807 --> 17:39.975
Thank you.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.393
Question about your TV...

17:41.393 --> 17:42.686
I want it. Gotcha.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.397
I started working
on this presentation

17:45.397 --> 17:48.317
to address specific
ethical dilemmas.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.027
The laws of robotics,

17:50.027 --> 17:51.820
whether torture
can be justified,

17:51.820 --> 17:54.114
and cloning people
for fun and spare parts.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.116
But I realized
before resolving

17:56.116 --> 17:58.327
any of these moral quandaries,
the real decision is

17:58.327 --> 17:59.995
who gets to decide.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.580
Do we put it up for a vote?

18:01.580 --> 18:03.832
Does everyone get to decide
for themselves?

18:03.832 --> 18:05.167
Should it be by committee?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.168
Is that committee

18:06.168 --> 18:07.628
elected or appointed?

18:07.628 --> 18:09.964
You see where I'm going?
You probably don't.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.465
For the smartest decision,

18:11.465 --> 18:13.133
we need the smartest person.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.970
Ladies and gentlemen, in
the field of scientific ethics,

18:15.970 --> 18:17.263
we can't rely on

18:17.263 --> 18:19.306
democracy or plutocracy.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.724
We need an autocracy,

18:20.724 --> 18:24.270
or to be more precise,
a "Sheldocracy."

18:26.355 --> 18:30.067
Um, I don't think
this was the assignment.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.860
Sorry, Dr. Sturgis,
I pick the assignments now.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.529
Everybody,
for next class,

18:33.529 --> 18:35.114
I want 500 words
on what you can do

18:35.114 --> 18:36.490
to further the Sheldocracy.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.117
Punishment for typos
will be severe.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.660
Class dismissed.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.828
Hey, that's my line.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.079
No, it isn't.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.872
Why don't you see me
after class.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.208
Class dismissed.

18:52.478 --> 18:54.105
And I'm telling you,

18:54.105 --> 18:56.107
your feelings are valid.

18:56.107 --> 18:58.317
I don't know.

18:58.317 --> 19:01.112
Hey. Hey.

19:01.112 --> 19:03.572
Look at me.

19:03.572 --> 19:05.950
I know.

19:07.910 --> 19:10.371
Now, tell me about
the rest of your day.

19:11.330 --> 19:13.624
Dusty...

19:13.624 --> 19:16.210
I think I'm done talking.

19:17.753 --> 19:19.588
Do you mean...?

19:19.588 --> 19:22.049
I do.

19:26.178 --> 19:28.239
Mom,
I've really got to go!

19:28.502 --> 19:30.711
Use the sink in the garage!
