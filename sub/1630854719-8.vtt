01:24.083 --> 01:25.710
<i>Revelation 21.</i>

01:27.629 --> 01:30.089
<i>"And I saw a new heaven and a new Earth.</i>

01:30.715 --> 01:33.927
<i>"For the first heaven
and the first Earth were passed away.</i>

01:35.595 --> 01:38.932
"And I heard a great voice
out of heaven say, 'Behold

01:40.391 --> 01:42.977
"'the tabernacle of God

01:42.977 --> 01:44.395
"'is with men.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.901
And God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes.'"

01:59.536 --> 02:03.164
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.041
It's okay, it's okay.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.550
I've read this passage too many times.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.561
Do you remember what comes next?

02:29.107 --> 02:32.026
"'And God will wipe away
all tears from their eyes,

02:32.902 --> 02:34.821
"'that there will be no more death,

02:35.780 --> 02:38.116
"'neither sorrow, nor crying,

02:39.242 --> 02:41.786
"'neither will there be any more pain,

02:42.537 --> 02:44.873
for the former things are passed away.'"

02:45.957 --> 02:47.959
Do you know what that means?

02:52.255 --> 02:53.298
Good.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.310
When can we bury him?

03:16.988 --> 03:19.115
The ground is too cold to dig.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.368
We'll bury your father in the spring.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.873
Bless you, God bless you.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.335
We'll get through this, Joyce.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.186
How much do we have left?

03:49.771 --> 03:52.315
Venison, elk, rabbit.

03:55.526 --> 03:57.320
Keep the whole town on rations,

03:59.864 --> 04:01.199
maybe a week.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.159
Two at best.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.333
Josiah and Martin
think they spotted some deer

04:10.333 --> 04:13.086
the other night, couple miles east.

04:14.629 --> 04:15.922
It was dark.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.383
See what you wanna see sometimes.

04:19.717 --> 04:20.843
Anyway.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.474
James.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.310
Yeah?

04:30.645 --> 04:32.563
I sensed doubt in there.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.151
They haven't lost faith in ya, David.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.277
They're just scared.

04:38.277 --> 04:39.904
Not from them.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.913
I still believe.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.293
It's been a--

04:54.460 --> 04:56.671
The last six months have been hard.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.548
For all of us.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.511
But I need to know you're with me.

05:06.514 --> 05:07.432
Yeah.

05:09.684 --> 05:10.601
Good.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.689
Now go get our guns.
We're goin' huntin'.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.567
All right.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.128
You thirsty?

06:27.095 --> 06:29.180
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

08:39.268 --> 08:40.811
No fucking way.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.500
Well, what do you think?

09:04.794 --> 09:06.587
I don't see anybody.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.589
You think we can just take it?

09:10.967 --> 09:13.886
Yeah. Quickly.
Whoever shot it's probably nearby.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.558
Don't!

09:20.643 --> 09:22.395
Drop your rifles!

09:23.854 --> 09:25.189
Now!

09:31.654 --> 09:34.573
Turn and face me, slow.

09:35.116 --> 09:38.119
Any sudden moves,
I put one right between your eyes.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.121
Ditto for buddy boy.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.165
You're quite a hunter.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.542
We didn't even hear you coming.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.669
Turn around and walk away.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.337
- Okay.
- Just go!

09:48.337 --> 09:50.423
Okay,
all I ask is 10 seconds of your time.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.216
- I just wanna talk.
- I won't say it twice.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.592
Please. Just 10 seconds.

09:53.592 --> 09:55.177
My name is David.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.804
This is my friend, James.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.141
We're from a larger group:
women, children,

10:00.141 --> 10:02.310
and we're all very, very hungry.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.896
I'm from a large group, too.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.815
Also hungry.

10:08.899 --> 10:12.153
Well, even so,
ya can't drag this back on your own.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.114
We're not asking for charity.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.532
We can trade you

10:16.532 --> 10:17.700
for some of the deer. We have--

10:17.700 --> 10:19.577
What do you need?
We have boots.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.120
Medicine?

10:22.455 --> 10:24.373
Like, for infections.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.376
We do.
Back in our village.

10:27.376 --> 10:28.627
You're welcome to follow us.

10:28.627 --> 10:30.838
I'm not following you anywhere.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.549
Buddy boy can go get it.

10:33.549 --> 10:36.260
He comes back, you get half the deer.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.054
Anyone else shows up, I put one--

10:38.054 --> 10:40.806
Put one right between my eyes.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.308
That's right.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.563
All right, go talk to Howard.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.774
He's got a case with some penicillin.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.860
Bring back two bottles and a syringe.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.907
It's not code, James. Do as I said.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.297
Ten steps back.

11:17.551 --> 11:18.886
Keep going.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.058
That's your dad's gun?

11:25.643 --> 11:27.186
He the one that's sick?

11:28.062 --> 11:29.980
That's why you're out here on your own?

11:31.690 --> 11:32.608
Well, look,

11:33.567 --> 11:35.736
it's a four-mile round trip
back to our settlement.

11:35.736 --> 11:38.489
It's gonna be a while before
James gets back.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.199
I have some oil and matches in my pack.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.827
We could take shelter,

11:42.827 --> 11:44.578
start a fire.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.169
Bring him with us.

11:52.878 --> 11:53.796
Go.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.027
You know, you really shouldn't be
out here all on your own.

12:17.027 --> 12:19.780
From where I'm sitting,
you shouldn't be out here on your own.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.991
Fair enough.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.202
So what's your name?

12:27.621 --> 12:29.206
It's hard to trust strangers. I know.

12:29.206 --> 12:31.834
But I honestly mean you no harm.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.755
And for what it's worth,
there's room for you in our group,

12:36.755 --> 12:38.424
if you want.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.676
You're inviting me to your Hunger Club?
Thanks.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.179
It's true. We're hungry.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.389
But we're still here.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.100
I'm a decent man

12:48.100 --> 12:51.270
just tryna take care of the people
who rely on me.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.105
You're their leader?

12:53.105 --> 12:55.399
Wasn't my choice. It was theirs.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.400
But

12:57.359 --> 12:58.444
yes.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.946
They "chose to follow you."

13:01.447 --> 13:03.824
Is this some weird cult thing?

13:05.451 --> 13:06.952
Well, you sorta kinda got me there.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.329
I am a preacher

13:08.329 --> 13:11.832
but just pretty standard Bible stuff.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.834
- What?
- The whole world ended

13:13.834 --> 13:15.753
and you still believe that shit.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.172
I actually started believing
after the world ended.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.966
Before that, I was a teacher.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.594
Math. Taught kids about your age.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.597
So you went from teacher to preacher
because, what?

13:26.597 --> 13:27.598
It fuckin' rhymes?

13:28.432 --> 13:29.767
Yeah, exactly.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.978
But seriously.

13:36.732 --> 13:40.319
Well, I found God, after the Apocalypse,

13:40.319 --> 13:42.947
which is either the best time
or the worst time to find Him,

13:42.947 --> 13:44.365
hard to say.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.953
But when the Pittsburgh QZ
fell in '17,

13:48.953 --> 13:50.788
Fireflies and FEDRA.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.083
I left with a few others

13:54.083 --> 13:56.502
and that's how
I ended up with our flock.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.921
Long way from Pittsburgh.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.593
Yeah, we'd settle somewhere,
and then raiders would come,

14:04.593 --> 14:06.220
so we'd move again.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.473
And as we wandered, we picked up

14:09.473 --> 14:12.851
new people along the way until,

14:12.851 --> 14:14.144
we ended up here.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.981
Well, your luck had to run out
sooner or later.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.607
Luck?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.278
There's no such thing as luck.

14:23.487 --> 14:27.116
No, I believe everything happens
for a reason.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.035
It does.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.329
It does. I can prove it to you.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.330
Okay.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.877
We didn't expect this winter
to be so cruel.

14:38.877 --> 14:42.089
Nothing'll grow.
Gameâ€™s been hard to find.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.676
So I sent four of our people
to a nearby town

14:45.676 --> 14:48.512
to scavenge what they could.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.432
And only three of 'em came back.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.727
And the one that didn't was a father.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.478
He had a daughter just like you.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.273
And her dad was taken from her.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.860
Turns out, he was murdered

15:02.860 --> 15:04.695
by this crazy man.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.072
And get this.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.617
That crazy man

15:10.618 --> 15:12.745
was traveling with a little girl.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.249
You see?

15:18.626 --> 15:20.753
Everything happens for a reason.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.921
James, lower the gun.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.301
She is the one that killed Alec,
isn't she?

15:27.301 --> 15:29.303
She didn't kill anybody.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.014
Lower the gun.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.231
Did you bring the medicine?

15:42.024 --> 15:43.942
- Yeah, but--
- Throw it to her.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.820
David.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.498
Back away.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.212
I know you're not with a group.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.547
You won't survive for long out there.

16:05.547 --> 16:06.799
I can protect you.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.188
So you're just gonna let her get away?

16:58.100 --> 17:00.602
Okay, the fuck do I put this, Joel?

17:01.311 --> 17:02.229
Joel?

17:03.021 --> 17:05.149
Joel, where the fuck do I put this?

17:07.025 --> 17:07.860
Fuck it.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.740
Only five more left.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.587
What is it?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.090
Venison.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.333
Big one.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.558
If you've heard a rumor,

19:44.558 --> 19:48.186
yes, we found a girl who was with the man
who took Alec from us.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.733
When the sun rises, I'll lead a group out
to pick up her trail.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.735
Won't be hard to find in the snow.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.487
We'll follow it
to wherever they're hiding

19:58.113 --> 20:00.032
and we'll bring that man to justice.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.576
You should kill him.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.202
You should kill both of them.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.794
I know you think you don't
have a father anymore.

20:55.253 --> 20:58.382
But the truth is, Hannah,
you will always have a father.

20:59.424 --> 21:02.344
And you will show him respect
when he's speaking.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.285
Thank you.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.880
Lord, bless this food and grant that we...

21:38.880 --> 21:41.216
May thankful for thy mercies be.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.635
To teach us to know by whom we're fed,

21:43.635 --> 21:46.638
bless us with Christ, the living bread.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.934
- Amen.
- Amen.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.536
Stay alert.

24:14.536 --> 24:17.581
If this man's not already dead,
he's dangerous.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.875
What about the girl?

24:20.458 --> 24:21.710
We bring her back with us.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.424
I don't mean to question
your sense of mercy, David.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.050
We can let her go.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.721
But we bring that girl back with us,
she's just another mouth to feed.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.348
If we leave her out here, she'll die.

24:36.224 --> 24:37.726
Yeah, but maybe that's God's will.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.666
Joel! Joel, wake up.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.668
Joel, wake the fuck up, Joel.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.515
Okay, okay, look at me.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.434
There are men coming, okay?

25:19.434 --> 25:22.562
I'm gonna lead them away from you
but if anybody makes it down here,

25:22.562 --> 25:24.814
you fucking kill them. You got it?

25:24.814 --> 25:26.566
Joel.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.568
Joel, do not fall asleep.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.297
Come on.

26:06.439 --> 26:08.066
Hey, motherfuckers!

26:09.818 --> 26:10.860
Shit!

26:12.612 --> 26:14.406
Go! Let's go.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.699
Alive!

26:29.254 --> 26:30.463
Keep comin', fuckers!

26:40.765 --> 26:42.267
I got her!

27:03.997 --> 27:04.831
Do it.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.665
Two of you with me. Drag the horse.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.295
The rest of you, stay here.
Go door to door.

27:54.214 --> 27:56.049
You so hungry for vengeance?

27:57.258 --> 27:58.760
Deliver it.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.870
I started worrying you wouldn't wake up.

31:17.875 --> 31:19.669
Let me out.

31:19.669 --> 31:22.255
Well, that's certainly the goal.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.590
Hungry?

31:23.590 --> 31:25.466
Why am I in a cage?

31:25.466 --> 31:27.302
Because I'm afraid of you.

31:27.302 --> 31:30.221
You're a dangerous person.
You've certainly proven that.

31:30.847 --> 31:33.766
The others, they want me to kill you
for all that's happened.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.356
Did you hear me say
the others wanna kill you?

31:40.356 --> 31:41.524
Yeah.

31:41.524 --> 31:44.319
- But I stopped them.
- Fuck you.

31:46.029 --> 31:49.282
- Why don't we just start with your name?
- Eat shit.

31:49.282 --> 31:51.451
Hey, listen to me!

31:51.451 --> 31:53.286
You can't survive on your own.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.829
No one can.

31:55.371 --> 31:56.706
But I can help you.

31:57.290 --> 31:58.833
Let me protect you.

31:59.208 --> 32:01.127
I'm not on my own.

32:02.962 --> 32:04.714
Right. Your friend.

32:06.799 --> 32:08.718
And how is he?

32:12.055 --> 32:14.599
I can see how much you care about him

32:14.599 --> 32:16.059
so I know it hurts.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.603
But even so

32:19.395 --> 32:21.314
you gotta face reality.

32:23.066 --> 32:25.985
That part of your life, it's ending.

32:26.861 --> 32:29.822
And what I'm offering you is a beginning.

32:30.990 --> 32:33.326
But if you can't find a way to trust me

32:35.078 --> 32:37.205
then, yes, you are alone.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.905
Timothy?

33:17.620 --> 33:18.538
Oh, shit.

33:33.177 --> 33:35.555
Stop, stop. Please.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.395
- Leave him alone.
- You're next.

33:43.229 --> 33:44.397
Please,

33:44.397 --> 33:46.315
I don't know any girl.

33:46.315 --> 33:48.943
- Oh, fuck!
- Jesus!

33:50.319 --> 33:52.488
- Marco.
- No-no, no-no-no.

33:52.488 --> 33:55.158
He can't help you. You focus right here.

33:55.158 --> 33:57.160
Or I'll pop your fuckin' kneecap off.

34:01.539 --> 34:02.665
She's alive.

34:03.499 --> 34:04.417
Where?

34:06.252 --> 34:09.547
Fuck! Fuck! The town!

34:09.547 --> 34:11.132
What town?!

34:11.758 --> 34:13.009
Silver Lake.

34:18.848 --> 34:21.100
It's not a real town name.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.685
It's a resort.

34:22.685 --> 34:24.353
A resort?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.532
You're gonna point to where we are

34:37.408 --> 34:39.327
and where your "resort" is.

34:39.786 --> 34:43.164
And it better be the exact same spot
your buddy points to.

34:43.164 --> 34:44.582
Okay.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.808
That's where we are.

35:02.225 --> 35:03.768
I swear.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.938
Go ask him. He'll tell you.
I'm not lying.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.860
No, no!

35:13.444 --> 35:16.739
Shit! Jesus! No!

35:18.908 --> 35:20.576
Why the fuck did you do that?!

35:20.576 --> 35:22.578
He told you what you wanted!

35:25.873 --> 35:28.334
You motherfucker. Fuck you.

35:28.334 --> 35:30.253
I ain't tellin' you shit.

35:30.253 --> 35:33.047
- It's okay, I believe him.
- No, no.

35:33.047 --> 35:34.006
No!

36:26.642 --> 36:29.395
For what it's worth,
this is just deer meat. I swear.

36:31.772 --> 36:34.400
You're gonna chop me up
into little pieces.

36:35.776 --> 36:37.320
I'd rather not.

36:38.195 --> 36:40.323
Please, just tell me your name.

36:44.118 --> 36:46.287
- If you wanna judge me--
- Judge you?

36:46.287 --> 36:49.498
You're eating people, you sick fuck!

36:56.923 --> 36:57.840
Yes.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.135
There are only a few of us that know.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.803
But I would've told you.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.972
Sooner or later. I guess sooner.

37:04.972 --> 37:07.308
- You're an animal.
- Well, yes, we all are.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.643
That's sorta the point.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.189
It was a last resort.

37:13.189 --> 37:15.191
You think it doesn't shame me?

37:15.816 --> 37:17.902
But what was I supposed to do?

37:17.902 --> 37:19.111
Let them starve?

37:19.111 --> 37:22.281
These people who put
their lives in my hands,

37:22.281 --> 37:25.326
who expect me to keep them safe,
who love me?

37:25.326 --> 37:26.953
Yeah, maybe.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.497
You don't believe that.

37:30.373 --> 37:32.291
I don't think your friend would either.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.086
Didn't he take another
man's life to save yours?

37:35.086 --> 37:37.004
He was defending himself.

37:37.004 --> 37:39.006
He was defending you.

37:41.467 --> 37:43.010
But you knew that.

37:44.637 --> 37:46.305
You see a lot.

37:46.305 --> 37:47.974
So do I.

37:47.974 --> 37:50.393
And you know what I see
when I look at you?

37:53.270 --> 37:54.188
Me.

37:55.398 --> 37:57.316
You remind me of me.

37:58.067 --> 38:02.196
You're a natural leader,
you're smart, loyal.

38:04.031 --> 38:05.241
Violent.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.163
You don't know anything about me.

38:11.163 --> 38:12.331
But I do.

38:12.873 --> 38:15.251
If I let you out of that cage right now,

38:15.251 --> 38:17.461
put that knife of yours in your hand,

38:17.461 --> 38:19.463
you'd stick me in a second.

38:20.089 --> 38:22.133
You have a violent heart.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.968
And I should know.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.641
I've always had a violent heart.

38:32.893 --> 38:35.688
And I struggled with it for a long time.

38:35.688 --> 38:38.441
But then the world ended
and I was shown the truth.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.777
Right, by God.

38:41.777 --> 38:42.778
No.

38:43.946 --> 38:45.489
By Cordyceps.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.326
What does Cordyceps do? Is it evil?

38:49.326 --> 38:50.911
No.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.997
It's fruitful. It multiplies.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.374
It feeds and protects its children

38:55.374 --> 38:58.919
and it secures its future
with violence, if it must.

39:02.506 --> 39:03.841
It loves.

39:05.676 --> 39:08.304
Why are you telling me all of this?

39:08.304 --> 39:10.222
Because you can handle it.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.933
The way the others can't.

39:14.769 --> 39:17.229
They need God. They need heaven.

39:17.229 --> 39:18.439
They need

39:20.566 --> 39:21.776
they need a father.

39:22.985 --> 39:24.528
You don't.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.155
You're beyond that.

39:27.823 --> 39:29.992
I'm a shepherd surrounded by sheep,

39:29.992 --> 39:31.827
and all I want

39:33.162 --> 39:34.705
is an equal.

39:37.124 --> 39:38.250
A friend.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.837
What about my friend?

39:43.214 --> 39:45.341
Like I said, loyal.

39:49.678 --> 39:52.223
I can tell the others
to stop looking for him.

39:54.683 --> 39:56.018
They'll spare him.

39:57.269 --> 39:58.354
Really?

39:58.354 --> 39:59.980
They'll just let him go?

39:59.980 --> 40:00.981
Yes.

40:02.066 --> 40:05.611
If he leaves us in peace,
they will just let him go.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.697
They do what I tell them to do.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.034
They follow me.

40:14.453 --> 40:16.580
And they would follow us.

40:18.749 --> 40:21.293
Lord knows I could use the help. I--

40:22.086 --> 40:23.629
Look what's happened.

40:27.508 --> 40:31.637
Think of what we could do together,
as strong as we are.

40:33.139 --> 40:35.057
We'd make this place perfect.

40:35.891 --> 40:38.644
We'd grow, spread out.

40:39.395 --> 40:42.523
And we'd do whatever
we needed for our people.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.986
Imagine the life we could give them.

40:54.577 --> 40:56.912
Imagine the life we could build.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.647
You little cunt.

41:27.943 --> 41:30.279
Let's see what I go tell the others now.

41:31.780 --> 41:32.907
Ellie.

41:34.241 --> 41:35.492
What?

41:35.492 --> 41:38.370
Tell them that Ellie is the little girl

41:38.370 --> 41:40.873
who broke your fucking finger!

41:42.333 --> 41:43.667
How did you put it?

41:44.585 --> 41:46.337
"Tiny little pieces"?

43:38.907 --> 43:41.702
No! No! No!

43:42.286 --> 43:43.871
Get off of me!

43:43.871 --> 43:44.913
Get off!

43:50.502 --> 43:53.047
- Wait, wait!
- Shut up!

43:53.589 --> 43:55.758
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

43:55.758 --> 43:57.593
Don't! Don't do it! Please, don't do it!

43:57.593 --> 43:59.887
- Please, don't! Don't!
- You had your chance.

43:59.887 --> 44:01.513
I'm infected!

44:02.139 --> 44:03.682
I'm infected.

44:05.684 --> 44:07.436
And now so are you.

44:09.772 --> 44:12.524
Roll up my sleeve. Look at it. Look at it!

44:21.200 --> 44:22.534
What did you say?

44:23.369 --> 44:26.205
Everything happens for a reason, right?

44:27.414 --> 44:28.332
David.

44:29.333 --> 44:30.250
No.

44:30.918 --> 44:33.587
No, she would've turned by now.
This isn't real.

44:33.587 --> 44:35.547
It looks pretty fuckin' real to me.

45:39.194 --> 45:41.113
There's no way out, Ellie.

45:41.989 --> 45:45.325
The doors are locked. And I have the keys.

45:48.579 --> 45:49.705
Ellie?

45:51.623 --> 45:53.625
Ellie!

45:58.464 --> 46:00.883
Ellie.

46:01.467 --> 46:03.719
I know you're not infected.

46:03.719 --> 46:07.431
No one infected fights
this hard to stay alive.

46:11.226 --> 46:13.770
So, how did you do it?

46:16.315 --> 46:17.774
What's the secret?

46:18.400 --> 46:22.029
Or are you just that fucking special?

46:23.530 --> 46:26.158
No one likes being humiliated, Ellie.

46:27.409 --> 46:29.745
You don't know how good I am!

46:31.330 --> 46:33.874
You don't know what I could've given you!

46:34.500 --> 46:36.627
If you had just let me!

46:38.754 --> 46:40.881
Well, I have news for you.

46:43.383 --> 46:45.719
Neither one of us is dying today.

46:47.930 --> 46:50.182
You see, I've changed my mind.

46:50.182 --> 46:52.935
I've decided you do need a father.

46:52.935 --> 46:54.937
So I'm gonna keep you

46:55.604 --> 46:57.022
and I'm gonna teach you.

46:59.733 --> 47:00.651
Ellie.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.367
Ellie.

47:15.332 --> 47:16.542
Fuck.

47:38.647 --> 47:40.315
I thought you already knew.

47:41.275 --> 47:43.777
The fighting is the part I like the most.

47:45.279 --> 47:47.447
Don't be afraid.

47:47.447 --> 47:49.157
"There's no fear in love."

48:35.120 --> 48:37.039
No! Get off of me!

48:37.831 --> 48:38.957
Get off!

48:39.499 --> 48:40.917
- It's me.
- Get--

48:42.044 --> 48:42.919
It's me.

48:44.212 --> 48:45.631
Hey, look.

48:46.089 --> 48:48.717
It's me. It's me.

48:50.510 --> 48:52.304
- It's okay.
- He--

48:53.180 --> 48:54.514
It's okay.

48:55.557 --> 48:57.017
It's okay, baby girl.

48:57.601 --> 48:58.727
I got you.

49:00.729 --> 49:01.855
I got you.

49:04.483 --> 49:05.651
Okay.
