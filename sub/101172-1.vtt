[Granny] What would you recommend
that I'd really like?

01:18.166 --> 01:19.416
[manager] Uh, this.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.625
[Granny] And this one, right here.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.250
-Mm-hm.
-And a salad, I think.

01:24.333 --> 01:25.250

Have you a reservation, sir?

-He's not here yet?

01:41.958 --> 01:44.416
I have a reservation under Grace.

01:46.583 --> 01:48.500

[Grace] Declared missing
from a shipwrecked ocean liner,

02:04.291 --> 02:06.916
only to return alive
after five-and-a-half years

02:07.000 --> 02:08.458
on a desert island.

02:08.541 --> 02:09.500
[chuckles]

02:09.875 --> 02:11.791
Ever since I first read your story,

02:11.875 --> 02:13.708
I've been dying to turn it into a book.

02:14.166 --> 02:15.583
Thanks for being here.

02:16.125 --> 02:19.000
You're way more handsome
in real life than in your pictures.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.375
[spits, coughs]

02:20.458 --> 02:22.333
-[Grace] You haven't had lunch yet, right?
-Uh...

02:23.125 --> 02:24.291
Um, not yet.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.458
That's good. I ordered ahead for us.

02:26.541 --> 02:28.250
[Chuck] Oh. Uh, thank you.

02:28.333 --> 02:31.416
Let's just cover the basics
while we're waiting for our lunch to come.

02:32.291 --> 02:33.875
Is it all right if I record?

02:33.958 --> 02:35.208
[Chuck] Yeah, it's okay.

02:35.291 --> 02:36.458
-[recorder clicks]
-Right.

02:37.041 --> 02:38.833
How have you been since your return?

02:39.500 --> 02:40.916
Busy, I guess.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.583
Adjusting to city life again
has been a little rough.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.291
Has it, now?

02:45.375 --> 02:47.208
Oh! Are there strange habits

02:47.291 --> 02:49.166
that you can't break
from your life in the wild,

02:49.250 --> 02:50.583
like capturing and eating pets,

02:50.666 --> 02:53.375
or running around town
with only a spear and a loincloth?

02:53.458 --> 02:55.041
[gasps]
Uh, no.

02:55.125 --> 02:56.541
Not like that at all.

02:56.875 --> 03:00.375
It's just it hasn't been easy
being around this many people.

03:01.458 --> 03:03.791
[gasps, sighs]
Yes, of course.

03:04.125 --> 03:06.833
Well, I really appreciate
you doing this interview.

03:06.916 --> 03:09.750
I had heard you were turning down
everybody that asked for one.

03:11.208 --> 03:14.375
Well, I've been rather torn about that.

03:15.750 --> 03:19.000
I've been worried that no one
would believe what I've been through,

03:19.083 --> 03:20.125
not all of it.

03:22.166 --> 03:24.541
But there are some
remarkable little creatures

03:24.625 --> 03:26.250
that the world should hear about.

03:26.791 --> 03:28.500
"Remarkable creatures"?

03:28.583 --> 03:30.625
But weren't you stranded
on the island all alone?

03:31.666 --> 03:34.166
[sighs deeply]

03:34.666 --> 03:36.958
I was alone, and yet I wasn't.

03:37.041 --> 03:39.208
I discovered some special friends.

03:39.291 --> 03:41.083
What kind of special friends?

03:41.166 --> 03:42.875
Sounds pretty mysterious.

03:43.250 --> 03:44.791
-[Chuck] After the ship went down...
-Hm?

03:45.166 --> 03:48.041
I floated in a ducky tube
until I spotted an island.

03:48.125 --> 03:49.500
A desert island so small,

03:49.583 --> 03:52.125
it took five steps to walk
from one end of it to the other.

03:52.208 --> 03:54.416
[sighs deeply]

03:54.791 --> 03:57.708
[Chuck] <i>And after six long months
alone on the island,</i>

51:42.166 --> 51:45.541
<i>a hundred thousand to a million
little fishy miracles.</i>

51:46.291 --> 51:50.625
<i>And when the time comes,
they will leave their parents' embrace</i>

51:50.708 --> 51:53.333
<i>to start a new journey in the vast world.</i>

51:54.166 --> 52:00.166
<i>Like their parents, they must survive
many hardships and seek out a partner,</i>

52:00.250 --> 52:04.458

with little miracles of their very own.</i>

-Wow! Awesome!
-[chef] For real?

52:11.333 --> 52:13.375
Those bugs are like a phoenix
or something.

52:13.458 --> 52:17.458
Yes, they are. Those little boogers
could survive any danger ever! Uh...

52:21.625 --> 52:24.291
Lots of people seem interested
in this story of yours.

52:24.375 --> 52:26.500
It's the first time that's happened.

52:26.791 --> 52:27.958

-Huh?

52:28.041 --> 52:30.583
Please! Please keep telling us your story!

52:31.208 --> 52:34.958
This is the best story I've heard
in my 84 years on Earth.

52:35.083 --> 52:36.250
So true!

52:36.333 --> 52:38.583
I'm dying to try some of that
tasty bug cuisine.

52:38.666 --> 52:40.125
Mmm-mmm.

52:40.208 --> 52:43.333

53:04.083 --> 53:05.166
Hmm.

53:05.250 --> 53:08.125
If I'm honest here,
this is hard to swallow.

53:08.208 --> 53:10.291
It sounds like a fantasy movie.

53:11.625 --> 53:13.458
And you haven't heard the half of it.

53:14.375 --> 53:17.708
