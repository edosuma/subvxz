about women. We're objects.

00:16.182 --> 00:18.059
Cheryl was obsessed with you.

00:18.143 --> 00:21.521
-I was afraid she might hurt you.
-Cheryl threatened me.

I can't trust you, V.

Welcome to <i>Carrie: The Musical</i>.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.126
Hey, Fangs.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.462
Okay, next. Introductions.

03:33.004 --> 03:36.841
I'm, uh, Archie.
I'm playing Tommy Ross, the boy next door. I'm Betty.
I play Sue Snell, the good girl.

03:42.096 --> 03:45.516
Veronica Lodge,
playing mean girl Chris Hargensen.

03:46.768 --> 03:50.438
I'm Cheryl Blossom,
playing the iconic role of Carrie White.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.318
Tone deaf.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.822
-I am.

04:00.823 --> 04:03.201
-Mom.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.410
Settle down.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.996
-It's untraditional.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.458
But nothing's more amateur
than age-inappropriate casting.

04:10.541 --> 04:15.004
I'm looking forward to getting to know
this woman, get under her skin.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.507
And spend some time
with my daughter Elizabeth.

04:19.717 --> 04:24.055
Sorry. I thought rehearsal
was in the Music Room.

04:24.138 --> 04:27.308
No problem. All are welcome here.

04:28.142 --> 04:31.145
<i>So,</i>  <i>Chuck Clayton...</i>

04:31.229 --> 04:34.023
Why did you say yes
to being in the musical?

04:35.024 --> 04:37.360
I'm trying to reform my image.

04:37.568 --> 04:41.531
And, yeah, maybe it's counter-intuitive
to be playing the villain,

04:42.115 --> 04:45.618
but somebody's gotta do it.
And I wanna do it right.

04:46.369 --> 04:51.082
You know, show up, put in the work,
be a member of the team.

04:53.584 --> 04:58.423
And, who knows, maybe then people will
start to change their minds about me.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.468
Kind of weird, huh? The two of us
playing boyfriend and girlfriend.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.305
Easy there, Arch.
Big Brother's watching.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.934
No, I mean, things are strained
with the four of us,

05:10.018 --> 05:13.855
but we're here for Kevin, to do this play.
Let's make it painless.

05:13.938 --> 05:18.067
Archie, Veronica lied to all of us,
you included.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.612
Conspiring with her parents
against the school?

05:21.696 --> 05:25.158
It's fine that you're doing
what Tommy Ross would do,

05:25.241 --> 05:28.286
which is stand by her.
But from where I'm standing?

05:28.369 --> 05:32.290
Veronica's as much of a privileged,
selfish, spiteful mean girl

05:32.373 --> 05:34.334
as the part she's playing.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.670
Okay, Act One, Scene One.

05:38.379 --> 05:41.966
Actually... before we begin...

05:43.885 --> 05:47.221
I've heard whisperings
that some of you ensemble-vultures

05:47.305 --> 05:49.974
don't think I'm fit to play, or sing...

05:50.058 --> 05:51.893
-No.
-the role of Carrie White.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.647

07:17.937 --> 07:22.483
I found a letter in my locker
from someone alleging to be--

I'm about to say this.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.280

07:32.160 --> 07:33.995
It's a prank. Look at it.

Why would the Black Hood,
who was shot dead by my dad,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.752

that the role of Carrie be recast?

07:41.836 --> 07:45.131

pretty small potatoes for the Black Hood.

07:45.214 --> 07:49.218
Yeah. Still, Jug,
you can't tell anyone about this.

Ronnie, I need to ask you something.

09:40.663 --> 09:45.293
What? You want us to take that sexy new
Firebird of yours to Lovers' Lane?

09:50.715 --> 09:53.884
I was gonna ask if I could keep it
at the Pembrooke.

09:53.968 --> 09:54.802
Why?

09:56.137 --> 09:58.681
I haven't told my dad about the Firebird.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.017
And our dads are literal rivals.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.811
If my dad finds out
yours gave me this gift,

10:03.894 --> 10:05.855
it'll trigger World War III.

10:06.188 --> 10:09.358
Fine. Our garage is your garage. About the election,
you really think Fred has a shot?

10:16.616 --> 10:20.953
In our favor, he's essentially running
on a platform of family values

10:21.037 --> 10:24.582
with none of his family by his side.
Mary's gone, thank God.

10:25.041 --> 10:29.545
And, well, Archie and Fred,
they've never been so distant, have they?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.674
We just need to keep it that way.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.512
No way is this legit.

10:38.596 --> 10:42.099
It's a legit threat,
but it's not from the real Black Hood.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.102
No. This is a classic
<i>Phantom of the Opera</i> tactic.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.864
That's a good point.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.285

Ugh. That's terrible.
It was probably Cheryl.

11:07.291 --> 11:10.002

that she shouldn't,

11:10.086 --> 11:12.380

11:13.506 --> 11:15.466
That's nice of you to say, Betty.

11:16.092 --> 11:20.763

without even letting you audition...

11:23.849 --> 11:26.268
Would you say you feel angry?

11:26.852 --> 11:28.854
I mean, I was born to play Carrie.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.859
So, not to be given a shot at it,
yeah, it makes me angry.

11:40.658 --> 11:44.495

Okay, Veronica,
I am obsessed with everything.

17:32.843 --> 17:36.513
Thank you. It helps to be off-book
and in full costume.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.725
Don't be so modest.

17:40.768 --> 17:43.479
You're the literal embodiment of Chris.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.440
Never has a role been
so perfectly typecast.

17:46.523 --> 17:47.441
Betty.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.445
What was that, Betty?

17:52.571 --> 17:54.114
I mean, think about it.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.076
Spoiled rich girl, check.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.621
Major daddy issues, check.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.081
Bad to the bone,

18:02.164 --> 18:06.585
trying to control everyone,
including her boyfriend and best friend,

18:06.668 --> 18:08.003
check, check, check.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.009
How could you be so mean?
-Archie--

18:14.093 --> 18:17.513
Betty, you have no idea
what's going on with Veronica.

18:18.514 --> 18:22.392
All this intense stuff with her family,
the pressure she's under.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.228
She's trying her best

18:24.311 --> 18:27.231
-under insane circumstances.

18:27.397 --> 18:30.943
Please, help me understand
so I can let this go.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.820
It's not for me to say, Betty.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.656
You remember how quickly she forgave you

18:35.739 --> 18:38.867
when the Black Hood made you say
those horrible things?

18:39.076 --> 18:43.163
So, really, who should be playing Chris
and who should be playing Sue?

18:47.417 --> 18:49.294
Archie, Betty, can you join us?

18:49.378 --> 18:52.214

19:39.011 --> 19:41.847
I agree with what you said back there.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.059
If there's anything
playing Chris has illuminated,

19:46.351 --> 19:49.563
it's that I've been a terrible friend.

Afternoon, gentlemen.

20:50.457 --> 20:54.753
I came to check on the show I'm producing,
and lo and behold, Fred Andrews.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.633
I'm just donating my free time, Hiram.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.806
-Mr. Lodge--

21:05.889 --> 21:09.601
In the new Firebird I bought him?
For the help he's given me.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.897
Yeah, it's a pretty smooth ride.

21:15.983 --> 21:16.900
Yeah.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.363
A young man never forgets his first car.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.046
<i>Dad, it's just a car.</i>

21:38.130 --> 21:42.134
Just a car?
Did I raise you to be that spoiled?

21:44.678 --> 21:46.930
This doesn't have to be a big deal.

21:47.597 --> 21:49.433
It is to me, son.

21:51.018 --> 21:54.438
I was planning on us
picking out an old jalopy.

21:54.521 --> 21:58.400
We could've fixed it up,
like me and Grandpa Artie did.

22:06.950 --> 22:10.746
Honey, I'm sure you're probably
still upset with me,

22:10.829 --> 22:14.499
but I still miss you,
and I am worried about you.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.755
I love you, Chic.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.008
Please call me when you can.

22:27.804 --> 22:29.139
Mom?

22:30.474 --> 22:35.687
Your brother won't return my calls.
Not that I blame him, for what I did.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.232
I'm gonna get water.
Do you want anything?

22:40.233 --> 22:44.529
Jughead, the sandbag was an accident,
and the letter was a prank, right?

22:44.613 --> 22:45.447
Seems like it.

22:45.530 --> 22:48.950
That's what I thought,
but I found this in my locker.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.994
A letter from the Black Hood.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.997
"This is your last warning
to replace Cheryl.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.416
Next time, the sandbag won't miss."

23:03.131 --> 23:07.052
Cheryl, it's your safety.
I have to recast the role of Carrie.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.638
I will not succumb to thespian terrorism and allow myself to be ousted from this.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.268
After the fires
I've walked through, Kevin, the world needs to see me
up on that stage,

23:18.105 --> 23:20.232
a phoenix reborn in the spotlight.

23:20.315 --> 23:23.193
Well, they'll have to wait, Cheryl.

23:24.361 --> 23:27.656
-Mother.
-Even in a town as twisted as Riverdale,

23:27.739 --> 23:32.911
students require parental approval
to partake in extracurricular activities,

23:32.994 --> 23:35.080
As I reminded Principal Weatherbee

23:35.163 --> 23:38.792
when I told him you didn't have
my approval to do the musical,

23:38.875 --> 23:39.918
and never will.

23:40.502 --> 23:43.839
So, you just feast
on broken dreams now, is that it?

23:43.922 --> 23:47.968
Playing a murderous telekinetic teen
who kills her mother?

23:48.635 --> 23:49.845
Please.

23:49.928 --> 23:54.057
This matricidal revenge fantasy,

23:54.975 --> 23:56.601
never gonna happen.

23:57.686 --> 23:58.770
That's final.

24:11.116 --> 24:17.164
Due to some circumstances, Cheryl
will no longer be playing Carrie White.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.420
Penelope Blossom
isn't much of a stage mom.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.425
Cheryl's by the gym bleachers.

24:31.928 --> 24:34.556
Cheryl's understudy will assume the role.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.057
Understudy?

24:36.141 --> 24:38.852
I appointed one
after the sandbag incident.

24:41.563 --> 24:42.439
Midge Klump.

24:48.445 --> 24:50.071
<i> Screw the musical.</i>

24:50.655 --> 24:54.618
I just wanted to prove to everyone
that I'm still me.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.120
But maybe I'm not.

24:58.455 --> 25:03.210
Toni, even Carrie White could stand up
to her mother.

25:03.668 --> 25:07.005
Cheryl, you gotta show your mother
who's in charge.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.425
I don't know if I can anymore.

25:11.426 --> 25:14.721
I'm not the same girl
who burned down Thornhill.

25:14.804 --> 25:15.847
Sure you are.

25:16.640 --> 25:21.228

And where's my tea?

27:40.158 --> 27:41.451
Mom.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.162
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

27:44.245 --> 27:45.997
Everything is crumbling.

27:47.707 --> 27:48.875
I've lost everyone.

27:48.958 --> 27:52.796
No, I haven't lost everyone.
I've driven everyone away.

27:56.299 --> 28:00.595
I gave my son away when he was born.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.057
And then I just did it again.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.727
And your father and I aren't together

28:07.811 --> 28:11.981
because we're still fighting
about something that happened years ago.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.903
And you and I have never been so frayed.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.920
<i>My mom's always been</i>
<i>a woman on the verge.</i>

28:35.130 --> 28:37.674
I have to do something
to help her, Jughead.

28:40.051 --> 28:45.181
Something to make her feel less alone
and abandoned.

28:48.435 --> 28:51.396
Guys, the programs are in,
and they look amazing.

28:51.479 --> 28:54.524
Make sure to get them signed
on opening night.

29:03.992 --> 29:07.245
-Gotta get the sets in.

29:07.328 --> 29:09.456
Yeah. I guess I just assumed--

29:09.539 --> 29:12.333
That I would quit
because we had a disagreement?

29:12.417 --> 29:14.252
That's not the way I roll.

29:19.424 --> 29:22.010
When Kevin came to me about Carrie,

29:22.093 --> 29:24.888
he said I was the embodiment
of Tommy Ross.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.516
Loyal, selfless...

29:29.976 --> 29:32.729
a hero, a force for good.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.733
But I'm none of those things.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.738
I'm not the hero of any story.

29:41.821 --> 29:44.574
<i>Lately I've been going down</i>
<i>this dark path,</i>

29:44.657 --> 29:46.618
<i>ignoring how much it hurt my dad.</i>

29:47.243 --> 29:49.329
<i>I gotta get something off my chest.</i>

29:50.830 --> 29:55.168
You may be my boss, but please,
don't try to get between me and my dad.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.670
Because I promise you, sir...

29:59.297 --> 30:03.760
that is a battle you will lose,
every time.

30:09.599 --> 30:11.476
Thank you for the Firebird...

30:14.687 --> 30:16.815
but I won't be needing it anymore.

30:33.122 --> 30:34.749
Oh, who are we kidding?

30:35.375 --> 30:39.337
It's opening night.
We're too nervous to eat, anyway.

30:46.052 --> 30:46.970
Alice?

30:58.231 --> 30:59.107
Thank you. Welcome.

31:05.321 --> 31:06.823
I'm allergic to peonies.

31:06.906 --> 31:11.077
But how would you know that?
We've only been married for decades.

31:18.459 --> 31:22.046
I'd really like to come back home, Alice.

31:23.631 --> 31:25.466
If you'll have me.

31:35.685 --> 31:40.565
If we do this, Hal, there can't
be any more secrets between us.

31:47.196 --> 31:49.824
-Yeah. There's something you should know
about Chic.

32:06.049 --> 32:10.386
To be honest, I always suspected
that Chic wasn't mine.

32:13.514 --> 32:15.058
I don't care, Alice.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.102
I wanna come home.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.025
Alice.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.743
Our secrets can't hurt us anymore.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.750
We can be together again.

32:57.517 --> 33:01.646
-I do, but this couldn't wait.

33:03.523 --> 33:05.441
I gave back the Firebird, Dad.

33:05.525 --> 33:09.696
Then I sold some of my stuff
so I could buy this off Junkyard Steve.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.841
It needs a lot of work, Dad...
but I'm up for it if you are.

33:37.306 --> 33:41.936

Claudius

35:59.365 --> 36:02.243
Do you know whose blood this is, Mommy?

36:03.244 --> 36:06.539
This is Jason's blood.
This is Daddy's blood.

36:07.248 --> 36:12.044
And the next blood to be spilt
will be yours.

36:12.128 --> 36:14.005
Cheryl, dear God.

36:14.797 --> 36:17.550
You've been in cahoots with Daddy's twin.

36:17.633 --> 36:20.595
You tried to kill Nana Rose,

36:20.970 --> 36:23.931
and then you shipped me off
to a ghoulish nunnery.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.018
But your depraved gambits are finished.

36:28.019 --> 36:33.900
If you so much as pluck one hair
from Nana Rose's little head...

36:35.943 --> 36:37.236
I'll end you.

36:41.657 --> 36:45.119
I burned one house down,
I'll happily burn another.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.747
Nightmare Child, what do you want from me?

36:47.997 --> 36:49.582
I wanna be emancipated.

36:50.666 --> 36:55.046
I want Thistlehouse all to myself
and my Nana.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.008
Start packing, Mommy.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.262
You and Uncle Claudius are pig-people

37:03.596 --> 37:06.724
and should live amongst the pigs.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.779
Thank you. Hello. Good to see you.

37:19.862 --> 37:22.823
Thank you. How are you?

37:28.829 --> 37:30.289
Hal. Come here.

37:34.710 --> 37:35.795
Did you bring it?

37:38.005 --> 37:38.839
Thanks.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.561
-I don't know.

37:56.857 --> 37:57.984
Fangs.

37:58.067 --> 38:01.112
I was giving Midge some last-minute notes.

38:01.195 --> 38:03.656
Hurry up. It's ten minutes to places.

38:13.374 --> 38:14.917
Hey, Ethel?

38:17.503 --> 38:19.130
I'm doing final interviews.

38:20.381 --> 38:21.215
Ethel?

38:50.244 --> 38:53.164
QED, folks, it was Ethel.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.166
What was?

38:56.042 --> 38:57.209
Uh...

38:57.293 --> 39:00.212
-Just the magazines.
-I know what you're thinking.

39:00.296 --> 39:01.130
You're wrong.

39:01.213 --> 39:04.675
-Those were for my vision board.
-It's okay. Tell me.

39:05.259 --> 39:07.511
Get out of my dressing room, Jughead.
Sounds like a guilty conscience to me.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.435
-Hey, Moose.
-Out of my way, Jug.

39:33.537 --> 39:36.791
when I say that your behavior
throughout rehearsals

39:36.874 --> 39:41.003
has been nothing short of that
of a proper Victorian gentleman.

39:41.087 --> 39:41.962
Um...

39:42.922 --> 39:44.507
What does that mean?

39:45.424 --> 39:48.302
Your pariahship is officially over.

39:51.680 --> 39:52.723
Hey, Betty. Chic...

39:58.938 --> 39:59.897
you made it.

40:00.481 --> 40:04.026
-Of course. I wouldn't miss this.
Five minutes to places!

40:06.445 --> 40:11.492
You should get back to your seat, Chic.
You're not really allowed to be backstage.

40:12.618 --> 40:13.452
No problem.

40:16.831 --> 40:17.998

All right, Carrietta,
it's time to come out of your closet.

41:23.898 --> 41:27.568
Uh, Kevin, did you re
Why isn't she on her knees?

41:28.319 --> 41:29.695
