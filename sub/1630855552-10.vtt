00:22.491 --> 00:25.163
What, you thinking
of going to college now?

00:25.263 --> 00:26.833
Yeah. Maybe.

00:26.933 --> 00:29.104
Bro, you got to be smart
to go to college. Fuck.

00:29.204 --> 00:30.875
Besides, like...

00:30.975 --> 00:33.011
you got to come here to learn,
not snag.

00:33.111 --> 00:35.984
That's, like, the only reason
to go to college, I think.

00:36.084 --> 00:38.624
I'm going on a snagging spree
if I go to college.

00:38.724 --> 00:40.594
You going to college?

00:40.694 --> 00:42.565
It was a joke, dummy.

00:42.665 --> 00:44.836
Of course it was, bro.

00:44.936 --> 00:47.340
Snag spree, whatever.

00:47.441 --> 00:49.210
Snagadelic, baby.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.148
- Snagaholic.
- What?

00:51.248 --> 00:53.386
Bro!

00:53.487 --> 00:54.722
Elora!

00:54.822 --> 00:56.325
Elora!

00:56.426 --> 00:57.695
Elora!

00:59.499 --> 01:00.901
What's going on?

01:01.001 --> 01:03.305
- Fuckin' bitch.
- There are baddies here.

01:03.405 --> 01:05.844
- You need to hook me up with...
- Y'all have an appointment?

01:06.979 --> 01:08.750
Uh, they're with me.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.085
Moral support.

01:10.185 --> 01:11.856
One of us goes to college,

01:11.956 --> 01:13.059
- we all go.
- Mm-hmm.

01:13.159 --> 01:14.695
- That's right.
- Okay.

01:14.795 --> 01:18.035
Well, y'all can't go
in there with her.

01:18.837 --> 01:21.275
- Thank you.
- Stupid.

01:21.375 --> 01:23.614
Okay.

01:23.714 --> 01:25.382
Now...

01:28.021 --> 01:30.126
It ain't supposed to be there.

01:30.226 --> 01:32.832
Aunties night out,
my birthday.

01:32.932 --> 01:34.367
Yeeh!

01:34.468 --> 01:36.506
God, we's rugged.

01:36.606 --> 01:38.843
Brings me comfort.

01:42.217 --> 01:44.020
So...

01:44.120 --> 01:45.824
Says here you dropped out
of high school.

01:45.924 --> 01:47.193
Why'd you do that?

01:47.293 --> 01:50.467
I guess I was just
in a different place.

01:50.567 --> 01:53.205
Now you know college is
harder than high school.

01:54.041 --> 01:55.544
You really gonna have to study.

01:55.644 --> 01:56.979
I understand.

01:57.079 --> 01:59.084
Okay, okay, so what
do we want to major in?

01:59.184 --> 02:01.489
Um...

02:01.590 --> 02:03.960
Maybe, uh, maybe mental health?

02:04.060 --> 02:07.066
Like, maybe work
as a mental health advocate.

02:07.166 --> 02:10.239
Or something, I-I don't know.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.645
Uh-huh, okay.

02:12.745 --> 02:15.884
Uh, well,
what about a scientist?

02:15.984 --> 02:18.088
Or a tribal leader?

02:18.188 --> 02:20.259
No.

02:20.359 --> 02:22.598
Okay.

02:22.698 --> 02:24.469
So mental health.

02:24.569 --> 02:26.138
Yeah.

02:26.238 --> 02:27.608
Now you need to remember
your first semester's

02:27.708 --> 02:28.777
gonna be a lot of fun.

02:28.877 --> 02:30.280
So I suggest

02:30.380 --> 02:32.718
that you get focused
on your basics.

02:32.818 --> 02:34.054
Do some studies
that you're best at,

02:34.154 --> 02:35.690
so you can really pull in
those A's.

02:35.790 --> 02:38.864
'Cause we all know what you
little shitasses gonna be up to.

02:38.964 --> 02:41.503
Y'alls gonna be partying,
y'all gonna be snaggin'.

02:41.603 --> 02:44.073
What?
My freshman year was lit.

02:44.173 --> 02:47.146
I went to OU.
We had us a 49 spot

02:47.246 --> 02:49.083
that we liked to call the field.

02:49.183 --> 02:52.123
Get your 49 songs ready.

03:01.175 --> 03:04.280
♪<i>♪ 49. ♪</i>

03:05.417 --> 03:08.456
I'd trade spots
with you in a minute.

03:08.556 --> 03:11.027
Mm, but anyway.

03:11.127 --> 03:13.299
There are no more scholarships available.

03:13.399 --> 03:15.369
Looks like they took 'em all up.
I mean, that's just

03:15.470 --> 03:17.240
what happens
when you're an older student.

03:17.340 --> 03:19.712
I-I'm not older.

03:19.812 --> 03:23.653
Yeah, but it's better to come
here right after high school.

03:23.753 --> 03:25.924
I mean, there's still
financial aid available.

03:26.024 --> 03:28.463
Yeah, so...

03:28.563 --> 03:30.734
we just need-- Oh.

03:30.834 --> 03:33.038
I see here
that your mom has passed.

03:34.141 --> 03:36.245
I'm sorry. Well, then

03:36.345 --> 03:39.117
we'll just need your father's
financial information.

03:39.217 --> 03:41.088
Uh, I don't have a dad.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.258
Girl, like your mom's a virgin?

03:43.358 --> 03:45.697
Shoot.
Last time I heard that story

03:45.798 --> 03:48.202
was when our Lord Savior
Jesus Christ was born now.

03:48.302 --> 03:49.572
What? No.

03:49.672 --> 03:51.041
I just, I don't live with him.

03:51.141 --> 03:52.478
I've never lived with him.

03:52.578 --> 03:54.715
You got a daddy.
He's on your birth certificate.

03:54.815 --> 03:56.719
I just, I don't even know him.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.024
I don't know how I'm supposed
to get that information.

03:59.124 --> 04:00.661
Dang, you kids.

04:00.761 --> 04:01.963
Always think I'm your therapist.

04:02.063 --> 04:04.034
Now, listen,
you ain't the first

04:04.134 --> 04:05.503
to not have no daddy.

04:05.604 --> 04:07.841
But you gonna need a daddy
to get this cheddar.

04:07.941 --> 04:09.879
I just, I don't...

04:09.979 --> 04:11.749
I don't know where to start.

04:11.849 --> 04:13.251
Grandfather Google.

04:13.352 --> 04:15.624
You think I know my dad?
Hell no.

04:15.724 --> 04:18.530
But I know his shoe size. Hell,
I even know his blood type.

04:18.630 --> 04:20.667
I know everything.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.706
So...

04:27.279 --> 04:29.652
So they're not gonna
give you money

04:29.752 --> 04:32.458
until they know that your dad,
whom you've never known,

04:32.558 --> 04:34.729
also doesn't have
a lot of money?

04:34.829 --> 04:36.632
Pretty much.

04:36.732 --> 04:38.235
Huh.

04:38.335 --> 04:40.372
Well, where's he at, then?

04:40.473 --> 04:42.545
- Let's go look for him.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:42.645 --> 04:46.117
What? Just show up and say,
"Hey, it's me, your daughter"?

04:46.217 --> 04:47.988
- Pretty much.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.391
- Why not?
- It's just business.

04:49.492 --> 04:51.361
It's not like you have
to move in with him.

04:51.462 --> 04:53.733
Yeah, or you can have
a relationship

04:53.834 --> 04:56.171
with him like I do with my dad.

04:56.271 --> 04:58.175
Can I borrow
your mom's car tomorrow?

04:58.275 --> 05:00.513
Yeah, should be okay.

05:00.613 --> 05:02.150
Yo, can I get shotgun?

05:02.250 --> 05:03.653
You want us to go with you?

05:04.789 --> 05:06.659
Uh, I should go alone.

05:06.759 --> 05:09.130
Like Luke
when he went to Dagobah?

05:09.230 --> 05:11.502
Uh... exactly.

05:25.096 --> 05:27.200
Thank you.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.171
- That gonna be it, Rick?
- Yeah.

05:29.271 --> 05:30.673
That's all for today.

05:30.773 --> 05:33.011
What you got there?

05:33.847 --> 05:35.917
That'll be 18...
million dollars.

05:36.017 --> 05:38.289
All right, how about 20?

05:38.389 --> 05:40.092
Make sure
that's not counterfeit.

05:40.192 --> 05:42.396
Yeah, well, you got
to keep me honest.

05:44.367 --> 05:45.904
- Thanks.
- See ya next time.

05:46.004 --> 05:47.641
Yeah.

05:56.593 --> 05:58.964
Can I help you?

05:59.064 --> 06:01.635
Oh, uh, I'm good. Thanks.

08:52.243 --> 08:53.813
Hey, look at me.

08:53.913 --> 08:55.650

08:58.923 --> 09:00.626
Look at me.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.408
I'll be damned.

09:17.561 --> 09:19.932
- Hey, Rick.
- Hey there.

09:20.032 --> 09:21.635
Get y'all something to drink?

09:21.735 --> 09:23.706
Yeah, I'd love
some coffee, thanks.

09:23.806 --> 09:26.044
Uh, me, too.

09:26.144 --> 09:27.615
I come here some mornings.

09:27.715 --> 09:30.854
They got great breakfast.
I don't know if you're hungry.

09:30.954 --> 09:32.458
No. I-I had chips.

09:32.558 --> 09:34.360
Chips for breakfast, huh?

09:34.461 --> 09:36.832
Why not?

09:36.932 --> 09:39.237
No... no reason.

09:39.337 --> 09:41.575
You know, I like chips.

09:44.581 --> 09:47.654
You look exactly
like your mother.

09:49.190 --> 09:51.629
Yeah, heard that my whole life.

09:51.729 --> 09:53.165
I bet.

09:53.265 --> 09:55.470
I looked you up once.

09:56.606 --> 09:59.144
On the, uh,
the old internets.

09:59.244 --> 10:00.680
That's kind of weird.

10:00.780 --> 10:02.416
Well, it...

10:02.517 --> 10:03.619
I mean, I was curious, you know.

10:03.719 --> 10:06.191
I wasn't sure if I was ever...

10:06.291 --> 10:08.529
gonna meet you in person.

10:09.330 --> 10:11.435
Why is that?

10:11.535 --> 10:14.608
Why didn't you think
you were every gonna meet me?

10:17.747 --> 10:20.921
I don't... I don't know. I...

10:21.021 --> 10:22.824
Uh...

10:22.924 --> 10:26.565
I'm-I'm glad that you...
you came to find me, though.

10:27.366 --> 10:29.036
I didn't.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.775
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

10:31.875 --> 10:34.347
I did come to find you, but not
to, like, pressure you, or--

10:34.448 --> 10:36.051
- Uh--
- I'm-I'm not looking for a dad.

10:36.151 --> 10:39.791
I just literally found out
you existed last week.

10:39.891 --> 10:42.664
I just need some information
from you.

10:42.764 --> 10:45.336
What-what kind of information?

10:45.437 --> 10:47.907
Uh, I'm filling out paperwork
for school.

10:48.007 --> 10:51.113
- Some financial aid stuff.
- Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, right.

10:51.214 --> 10:53.953
- Oh, thanks.
- All right.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.726
Uh...

10:56.826 --> 10:58.228
Anything to eat?

10:58.328 --> 11:01.067
Yeah. You know, I was thinking
about, uh, getting some pie.

11:01.167 --> 11:02.403
- Okay.
- You want pie?

11:02.504 --> 11:03.773
Uh, no, I'm good.

11:03.873 --> 11:05.610
Oh, no.
They have really good pie.

11:05.710 --> 11:08.483
They have good, um, cherry,
coconut, butterscotch, um--

11:08.583 --> 11:10.586
I'm fine. I'm good, thanks.

11:12.190 --> 11:15.763
Okay. Yeah, no. You know,
me, too. Coffee's fine.

11:15.864 --> 11:17.967
Yeah, I need to lay off
the sugar.

11:18.067 --> 11:21.307
- Let me know
if you change your minds.
- Okay, I will.

11:23.946 --> 11:27.086
Wow, that's...

11:27.186 --> 11:28.321
You get that from me.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.258
- What?
- The sugar.

11:30.358 --> 11:32.330
I love sugar.

11:32.431 --> 11:34.501
Everyone loves sugar.

11:36.439 --> 11:38.408
That's true.

11:38.509 --> 11:40.880
Good point. Uh...

11:43.720 --> 11:48.429
It's funny. You know,
I've thought about meeting you

11:48.529 --> 11:51.602
a-a lot, and I...
I thought I would have...

11:51.702 --> 11:55.509
all these things to say,
and now I'm...

11:56.745 --> 11:59.350
I'm really nervous.

12:02.624 --> 12:06.565
There's... there's nothing
to be nervous about.

12:07.901 --> 12:10.473
There's nothing
we can do right now anyway.

12:10.573 --> 12:12.811
Yeah. I mean,

12:12.911 --> 12:15.015
well--

12:15.115 --> 12:18.088
I would...
I'd like to get to know you.

12:18.188 --> 12:19.892
Yeah.

12:19.992 --> 12:22.396
I don't know
if that's for the best.

12:23.198 --> 12:25.236
Yeah?

12:25.336 --> 12:26.839
Yeah.

12:26.939 --> 12:28.976
Okay.

12:29.945 --> 12:32.082
Well, did you know
that I named you?

12:32.918 --> 12:35.222
- You did?
- Yeah. Elora.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.728
Did you know that it's, uh,
from the movie <i>Willow?</i>

12:37.828 --> 12:41.033
Yeah, how could I not?
Reminded of it basically

12:41.134 --> 12:43.439
every time I talk
to somebody over the age of 30.

12:43.539 --> 12:45.609
Well, sorry. I was a...

12:45.710 --> 12:47.881
I was a bit of a...
of a movie nerd. You know,

12:47.981 --> 12:50.152
- and Ron Howard made
that movie and--
- Is it cool if I...

12:50.252 --> 12:52.189
You know, he's from Oklahoma.
Yeah, yeah, sure.

12:52.289 --> 12:54.394
Sure, sure, yeah.
I just thought it was cool

12:54.495 --> 12:57.300
he was from Oklahoma, and...

12:57.400 --> 13:00.005
- Ooh.
- Just fill...

13:01.575 --> 13:03.311
- ...this section out.
- Uh-huh.

13:03.411 --> 13:05.784
And then, uh, they might need
you to email some stuff over.

13:05.884 --> 13:08.021
I'll... I could get you
the information.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.858
Okay.

13:09.958 --> 13:12.396
- Okay, looks pretty simple.
- Yeah.

13:12.497 --> 13:14.568
Oh, college, huh?

13:14.668 --> 13:17.239
That's great. That's... Yeah.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.577
I never went to college.

13:21.381 --> 13:23.117
What <i>do</i> you do?

13:24.120 --> 13:27.026
Uh... I paint houses.

13:27.126 --> 13:29.697
Look, I... just...

13:29.798 --> 13:32.837
I feel like I should tell you
that I'm sorry.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.075
You know, I am.
I'm really sorry

13:35.175 --> 13:37.079
that I wasn't there
for you ever.

13:37.180 --> 13:39.651
And I could tell you...
I don't know. I mean,

13:39.751 --> 13:41.655
- you know, obviously,
I was young.
- Wait.

13:41.756 --> 13:44.393
Listen. You really don't have
to do all that.

13:44.495 --> 13:47.934
- No, I--
- Okay? I'm... I'm grown.

13:48.034 --> 13:50.806
There was a time where I wished
you might have been there,

13:50.906 --> 13:53.780
or a dad was there, but...

13:53.880 --> 13:55.884
I had a lot of people
looking out for me.

13:55.984 --> 14:00.025
So everything I need from you
fits on that piece of paper.

14:01.795 --> 14:04.567
Right. Well, uh...

14:06.538 --> 14:08.643
Um, let's get to it.

14:08.743 --> 14:11.982
Uh... Shit.

14:12.083 --> 14:15.088
You have a pen?
I don't... I don't have mine.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.670
- It's okay.
- No, I-I can--

14:22.770 --> 14:24.541
No, I got it.

14:26.010 --> 14:29.183
Excuse me. Hey, um, I'd like
to borrow a pen from you.

Hmm.

18:11.094 --> 18:13.098
What about their mom?

18:14.300 --> 18:19.309
Oh, yeah. Well, she got a bit
of an opiate addiction,

18:19.409 --> 18:23.419
so, you know,
we separated a few years ago,

18:23.519 --> 18:25.221
and I got custody.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.359
She's in treatment now,
and, you know, we're all hoping

18:27.460 --> 18:30.165
she keeps it clean,
'cause the kids really miss her,

18:30.265 --> 18:31.400
especially Marty.

18:37.713 --> 18:40.519

18:40.619 --> 18:42.523
Yeah. Guilty.

- You don't want any milk,
do you?
- It's all right.

18:55.950 --> 18:58.154
Yeah, so I'm about as white

your mother and me had been
breaking up off and on all year,

21:15.429 --> 21:17.700
and then
she invited me to your party,

21:17.800 --> 21:20.439
and I thought
we were getting back together.

21:21.875 --> 21:23.478
But we weren't.

I blamed your mom.

You know, and then,
I blamed your grandmother Mabel.

21:32.061 --> 21:34.299
But the truth is it's...

21:35.301 --> 21:37.673
It's me.

21:37.773 --> 21:39.276
I was too fucked-up, you know?

21:39.376 --> 21:42.115
I-I... I wasn't ready.

21:42.215 --> 21:45.623
Plus, I have
a bad habit of running

21:47.827 --> 21:50.031

No, no, no. Hey, look,

22:23.632 --> 22:25.636

No. It-It'd be really fun.

22:36.424 --> 22:38.695
The truth is, they...
they would be really stoked.

22:38.795 --> 22:40.566
I mean, we don't have
to tell them anything.

22:40.666 --> 22:42.637

You're a friend, whatever.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.173

22:44.273 --> 22:46.043

my daughter a joint, huh?

23:24.921 --> 23:27.025
Is that your car?

23:27.126 --> 23:29.430
Uh, borrowed it.

23:29.531 --> 23:32.937
Well, if you got a little extra
cash, I got a pickup for sale.

23:38.281 --> 23:40.185
How'd you meet my mom?

23:40.285 --> 23:43.726
Mm, we were friends,
me and your mom.

23:43.826 --> 23:45.596
I mean, uh, I don't think

23:45.696 --> 23:49.504
I could remember the first,
you know, moment I met her.

23:49.604 --> 23:51.273
We partied together back then.

23:51.373 --> 23:53.545
You know, that was
before I quit drinking.

23:53.646 --> 23:56.083
And I don't know. I just
ran with that whole crowd.

23:56.183 --> 23:58.387
You know, that's how we met.

23:59.189 --> 24:02.161
I'm assuming I wasn't planned?

24:03.799 --> 24:06.003
Sorry.

24:06.103 --> 24:07.807
Oh, it's okay.

24:07.907 --> 24:10.746
No, we were probably together
only four months

24:10.846 --> 24:12.984
when she told me
that she was pregnant.

24:13.084 --> 24:16.991
I mean, we... we were not great
together, your mom and me.

24:17.091 --> 24:19.998
I mean... I mean, I was-I was...
I was crazy about her.

24:20.098 --> 24:21.468
Really crazy. Like, too crazy.

24:21.568 --> 24:23.772
I probably would've
gotten sick of me, too.

24:23.872 --> 24:27.078
It's just,
we fought all the time.

24:27.179 --> 24:29.082
We were...

24:29.182 --> 24:30.586
We were so young.
I mean, fuck.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.924
We had no business
having a baby.

24:33.892 --> 24:36.732
I mean, that's-that's not...
that's not an excuse.

24:36.832 --> 24:38.267
I was too young.

24:38.367 --> 24:40.605
I should have tried
a lot harder.

24:43.277 --> 24:45.181
It's just...
I don't know.

24:45.281 --> 24:47.185
You know, and now, I-I've...

24:47.285 --> 24:49.490
With these kids...

24:50.693 --> 24:52.797
...you know, I got a...
I got a second chance

24:52.897 --> 24:55.134
to be a better father.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.750
You never get
the first pancake right, hmm?

25:03.786 --> 25:05.423
I'm not comparing you
to a pancake.

25:05.523 --> 25:07.025
That's not what I'm doing.
I'm sorry.

25:07.125 --> 25:09.864
I'm just, like...

25:09.964 --> 25:11.333
I'm talking about you

25:11.434 --> 25:13.137
like you're not standing
right in front of me,

25:13.237 --> 25:14.908
and I'm sorry.

25:15.008 --> 25:16.711
Why didn't you?

25:16.811 --> 25:20.852
Try to stick around?
Or... did you?

25:23.391 --> 25:26.196
I did, uh, for a bit.

25:27.467 --> 25:29.036
I mean, it's still
pretty fucked-up

25:29.136 --> 25:30.104
no matter what, right?

25:30.204 --> 25:32.341
Leaving a kid?

25:33.110 --> 25:35.414
Yes, it is, definitely.

25:35.515 --> 25:40.493
Uh... I could offer you,
like, a hundred reasons,

25:40.593 --> 25:43.097
but it... it doesn't matter.

25:43.197 --> 25:44.233
You know, I mean,
I'm not a perfect person.

25:44.333 --> 25:45.736
You know, I-I-I...

25:45.836 --> 25:47.506
Nobody's saying
you have to be perfect. It's...

25:47.606 --> 25:49.410
I don't think.
I'm not saying that.

25:49.511 --> 25:51.614
No, and-and nobody
has accused me of that.

25:51.714 --> 25:53.051
It's just-just...

25:53.151 --> 25:55.355
I don't know. Here-here I am,
and I got these new kids.

25:55.456 --> 25:57.125
And I've known about...

25:57.225 --> 26:00.566
I mean, I've-I've always known
that you were there. I-I...

26:02.269 --> 26:04.405
I just... I don't understand

26:04.507 --> 26:06.277
why I didn't just go down there

26:06.377 --> 26:08.414
and knock on your door
like you did.

26:08.515 --> 26:10.853
I mean, I could have done this
a lot earlier.

26:10.953 --> 26:14.359
And now it seems
so stupid and weak.

26:17.165 --> 26:18.869
Pretty weak.

26:18.969 --> 26:21.541
This is our stop.

26:22.341 --> 26:24.547
That's life, right?

26:24.647 --> 26:26.918
Fuck up and try to fix it

26:27.018 --> 26:29.457
or not to fuck up again.

26:34.199 --> 26:36.437
Can I ask you some things?

26:38.240 --> 26:40.913
- Yup.
- I don't...

26:41.013 --> 26:43.383
What's your favorite subject
in school?

26:43.485 --> 26:46.023
- You know?
- Dropped out.

26:46.123 --> 26:48.026
Oh, wow. Like me.

26:48.127 --> 26:50.398
You, uh... you play any sports?

26:50.499 --> 26:53.505
I used to play basketball
and then I quit.

26:53.605 --> 26:55.909
Oh, yeah?
Who-who was your coach--

26:56.009 --> 26:57.245
was it Bobson?

26:57.345 --> 26:58.982
- Yeah.
- Oh!

26:59.082 --> 27:00.185
Shit.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.421
- For real.
- I mean,

27:01.521 --> 27:03.157
he can't even play basketball.

27:03.257 --> 27:04.961
I mean, did y'all suck?
I mean...

27:05.061 --> 27:07.232
We were pretty good.
A bunch of rez girls.

27:07.332 --> 27:09.035
Yeah? Did you shoot the three?

27:09.136 --> 27:12.375
I mean, I don't see you
dunking anytime soon.

27:13.478 --> 27:15.715
I was point guard.

27:15.815 --> 27:18.622
I got some points and then
I cussed Bobson out and quit.

27:18.722 --> 27:21.727
I like that. Does he still have
that crazy red mane of hair?

27:23.598 --> 27:24.967
Hardly. He's pretty bald now.

27:25.068 --> 27:26.705
Yeah, well, I still got
a full head of hair, huh?

27:26.805 --> 27:28.340
I mean, I got that going for me.

27:29.142 --> 27:30.712
Right.

27:33.150 --> 27:35.522
Where are you staying now?

27:37.292 --> 27:40.398
At my... at my grandma's.

27:40.499 --> 27:42.503
I got the house
after she passed.

27:44.105 --> 27:47.378
Oh, I-I didn't...
I didn't know that she passed.

27:48.147 --> 27:49.851
Uh, I'm sorry.

27:49.951 --> 27:51.822
- Yeah.
- You know, it's another thing.

27:51.922 --> 27:56.062
I don't know if this is
a-a cop-out, or... I just...

27:56.163 --> 27:58.034
I didn't want
to take you away from all that.

27:58.134 --> 28:01.641
You know, I didn't want to take
you away from your family,

28:01.741 --> 28:04.613
from your people. I...

28:06.250 --> 28:08.621
And-and I was a coward.

28:10.057 --> 28:12.094
It was a cop-out.

28:13.097 --> 28:14.767
Yeah?

28:18.641 --> 28:20.546
I called after your mom's wreck,
you know,

28:20.646 --> 28:22.415
to see if I could come over.

28:24.319 --> 28:26.223
But Mabel...

28:26.323 --> 28:28.361
She didn't want me to.

28:28.462 --> 28:30.599
And I decided to honor that.

28:30.699 --> 28:32.903
I didn't even go to the funeral.

28:34.306 --> 28:37.646
Just sat at home and cried.

28:42.790 --> 28:45.027
And you were relieved?

28:46.130 --> 28:48.367
Relieved?

28:49.637 --> 28:51.574
To not have to raise a kid.

28:51.674 --> 28:54.513
Oh, no. No. God, no.

28:59.155 --> 29:00.625
Yes.

29:00.725 --> 29:02.729
Yes, I was relieved.

29:04.533 --> 29:07.839
And then I got to be
a shitass for a decade.

29:09.209 --> 29:11.814
It wasn't worth it.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.958
I look nothing like you.

29:17.058 --> 29:19.095
Mm-mmm.

29:21.468 --> 29:24.607
I mean, this is so, uh...

29:24.707 --> 29:25.775
- Crazy?
- Yeah!

29:25.875 --> 29:27.245
This. It's like I'm-I'm...

29:27.345 --> 29:29.016
I know what I want to...

29:29.116 --> 29:31.019
Oh, saved by the bell.

29:34.192 --> 29:36.430
Hey, kids! Hey, Sam.

29:36.530 --> 29:38.234
Hey.

29:38.334 --> 29:39.670
Hey, Megan!

29:39.770 --> 29:41.874
I want you
to meet my new friend.

29:41.974 --> 29:44.279
This is Elora.

29:44.379 --> 29:46.217
Elora is...

29:46.317 --> 29:48.254
your sister, Elora Danan.

29:48.354 --> 29:49.657
Uh, Elora, this is

29:49.757 --> 29:53.163
Megan, Ally
and my main man Marty.

29:53.263 --> 29:54.500
We have another sister?

29:54.601 --> 29:56.069
Yes, we do. Can you believe it?

29:56.169 --> 29:58.875
There's more of us!
We can outnumber 'em now, huh?

29:58.975 --> 30:00.579
Will you eat pizza with us?

30:00.679 --> 30:02.549
Oh, that's right.
Today's pizza Friday.

30:02.650 --> 30:06.056
- You want to join us?
That's right. No. Yeah.
- I-I...

30:06.156 --> 30:08.093
Yeah, you-you, uh...
Elora's got some people

30:08.193 --> 30:09.730
that's she's got
to meet later, um, but

30:09.830 --> 30:11.133
she's gonna walk back
to the house with us.

30:11.233 --> 30:12.503
Right?

30:12.603 --> 30:14.974
- Come on, guys.
- Hey.

30:17.746 --> 30:20.586
You know what?
I'll eat pizza with you.

30:22.355 --> 30:23.758
Did you hear that?

30:23.858 --> 30:25.862
Our brand-new sister

30:25.962 --> 30:29.235
is gonna have pizza Friday
with us, huh?

30:29.336 --> 30:31.440
That's pretty good news, right?

30:31.540 --> 30:34.780
Hey, it was Ally, Marty
and Megan?

30:34.880 --> 30:36.350
Nice.

30:36.451 --> 30:37.686
All right, let's dive in, everybody.

the Creek expression

30:39.991 --> 30:41.192
