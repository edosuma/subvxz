GEORGIE (VOICEOVER):
Previously on "Heartland."

00:04.295 --> 00:05.672
VAL: About Georgie--

00:05.797 --> 00:07.590
I don't think she wants
this badly enough.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.175
 There is nothing
Georgie wants more

00:09.300 --> 00:10.510
than to win the fall finale.

00:10.635 --> 00:13.304
 I'm going to come
to a training session.

00:13.430 --> 00:14.848
I expect to be impressed.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.267
 I saw that lady who owns
Flame talking and Dylan.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.560
 So?

00:18.685 --> 00:20.228
 She wants Dylan to
ride one of her horses.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.604
 That doesn't make any sense.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.273
 I'm just telling
you what I heard.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.066
 No, you're trying to
make it sound like Dylan

00:25.191 --> 00:26.443
is going after Flame.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.945
 Yeah, well that seems
pretty obvious to me.

00:29.070 --> 00:32.365
 Yeah, you uh, you got my
email about Jade Virani.

00:32.490 --> 00:35.410
I'd really like to see her
in your program, Billy.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.162
Well, you have better
rodeo training.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.080
You got scholarship money.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.082
 This bird, what is it?

00:41.207 --> 00:42.584
 It's a sacred Falcon.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.878
 I saw one this morning.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.922
 The bird's a Warrior,
a symbol of bravery.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.384
Keep it to balance out
the dark, and to remind

00:51.509 --> 00:54.346
yourself to be brave
enough to let the light in.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.140
 Good job.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.480
 Nice.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.899
Hey, that was a
really good practice.

01:48.024 --> 01:48.817
 Thank you.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.193
 Yeah.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.444
Well, I wanted to
tell you something,

01:51.569 --> 01:52.862
but didn't want to
steal your focus there,

01:52.987 --> 01:54.447
but I got some news.

01:54.572 --> 01:55.240
 OK.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.616
 I got some great news.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.284
OK?

01:58.410 --> 02:00.495
Remember I was talking about
you going to school down South?

02:00.620 --> 02:01.830
 Yeah.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.873
 OK, well I called a
coach, a buddy of mine

02:03.998 --> 02:05.583
at a Texas College.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.711
One of his kids dropped
out of the program,

02:07.836 --> 02:11.381
scholarships become available,
and guess who they want?

02:11.506 --> 02:12.507
 Me?

02:12.632 --> 02:14.509
 That's right.

02:14.634 --> 02:18.346
Full ride, all expenses paid.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.723
 But school starts next week.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.182
 Yeah so?

02:21.307 --> 02:22.142
That's right.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.269
You better get packing.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.311
 But I would I'd have to--

02:25.437 --> 02:26.271
I'd have to drop out of USC.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.147
I really like it.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.815
There

02:28.940 --> 02:31.151
 You're not thinking of
turning this down, are ya?

02:31.276 --> 02:33.862
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

02:33.987 --> 02:34.779
 Well--

02:34.904 --> 02:35.947
I get it.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.532
Too much information too fast.

02:37.657 --> 02:38.616
I know.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.035
OK, tell you what.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.746
You just let her sink in.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.372
I'll put the information
on the school together.

02:44.497 --> 02:45.832
You just think
about it overnight.

02:45.957 --> 02:49.836
We'll talk about it
tomorrow, but this is great.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.839
I'm so proud of you.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.549
OK.

02:54.674 --> 02:55.842
Congratulations.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.055
[music playing]

03:00.180 --> 03:01.222
 Easy.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.145
[horse grunts]

03:07.270 --> 03:08.355
 You both seem a bit tight.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.398
Just a smoother
approach, next time.

03:13.109 --> 03:14.486
Yeah, that's it.

03:17.906 --> 03:18.698
OK.

03:18.823 --> 03:19.699
Look.

[horse grunting]

03:28.541 --> 03:30.293
[sigh]

03:30.418 --> 03:32.879
 Sorry, I couldn't
find the distance.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.047
 That's OK.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.340
 No, it's not.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.758
Not really.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.843
They only get higher
as the season goes on.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.054
 Yeah, but there's
nothing wrong with knocking

03:41.179 --> 03:42.222
a few jumps in practice.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.807
It's all part of the process.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.352
 Right, but this feels like
a repeat of all the issues

03:47.477 --> 03:49.813
she was having with
the devils lake jump.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.441
 Yeah, but she jumped that
fine in the competition.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.778
 In a rather pedestrian
time, if you'll recall.

03:56.903 --> 03:57.779
[clap]

03:57.904 --> 03:58.780
 That's right.

03:58.905 --> 03:59.739
You weren't there.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.910
 I certainly hope your
busy schedule isn't

04:04.035 --> 04:06.079
going to continue to get in the
way of our prep for the fall

04:06.204 --> 04:07.539

04:07.664 --> 04:10.625
Georgie, something's
got to give here.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.962

isn't going to cut it.

When you're on my team,
you're first place,

 Hey.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.396
 Georgie, do you
have your phone?

04:31.521 --> 04:33.356
Because Tim wants
your mom in on this.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.066
 Yeah, sure.

04:35.191 --> 04:38.153
 OK, Grandpa, what is this
whole family meeting about?

 I'm not sure.

This is your dad's deal.

your mom on the phone?

- Yeah.
- Good.

OK. where's Ty?

We need Ty.

 He's in Vancouver.

04:52.792 --> 04:53.460

two years being sober.

Hi, Georgie.

 Hey, Lou.

 Hi honey, it's Dad.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.895
 Well, I have something
I want to tell everyone.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.856
I was sitting on my porch this
morning having a cup of coffee,

05:14.981 --> 05:18.234
looking at the fall colors,
thinking about family,

05:18.360 --> 05:20.445
about life, about
how important it

05:20.570 --> 05:22.447
is not to miss opportunities.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.328
I know, I don't talk
like this normally.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.704
 No kidding.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.247
Where are you going
with this, Dad?

05:31.373 --> 05:37.337
 Well, I had an epiphany
about your mom, about Marian.

05:39.881 --> 05:43.009
It's been 10 years
since your mom passed.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.344
 Wow.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.513
 Yeah, I guess it
has been 10 years.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.889
 I'd like to do
something special.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.226
I think we should do
another Memorial ride,

It'll recharge your batteries.

should pass where we don't do

07:05.425 --> 07:06.968
something to remember your mom.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.888
And we all get caught up
in our day to day routines,

of what's important.

high school reunion next week

07:17.270 --> 07:19.105

need to talk to them.

 She's got to chill out to.

It's just a dance.

 Yeah I can't think of
anything I'd rather do less.

 Really?

08:58.955 --> 09:00.331
 Yeah.

It's a competition to see
who has the fanciest dress.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.753
It's just really
pretentious and lame.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.545
 Yeah.

So lame.

- No.
- What?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.027
Why not?

09:29.152 --> 09:30.737
 I just didn't,
uh, get the chance.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.155
 But you were just with her.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.948
 Yeah, well, I
brought up the formal,

09:34.074 --> 09:35.408
and she just kind
of thinks it's lame.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.284
 Oh.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.285
 So--

09:37.410 --> 09:38.495
 That's too bad.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.246
You know, even a
down to earth girl

09:40.372 --> 09:41.748
like George who does
actually like to get

09:41.873 --> 09:43.416
dressed up once in a while.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.251
How you gonna know what she
wants if you don't ask her?

09:45.377 --> 09:46.336
 See ya, OK?

09:46.461 --> 09:47.921
 I love you.

09:48.046 --> 09:48.922
Ask her!

09:49.047 --> 09:51.091
 Mom, stop!

09:51.216 --> 09:59.307
[music playing]

09:59.432 --> 10:01.059
 What's this?

10:01.184 --> 10:02.769
 We're doing
something different.

10:02.894 --> 10:03.812
 OK.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.105
 We're going smaller.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.774
No lower jumps, no
combinations, no lines.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.818
I don't want you to think
about counting stripes.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.444
 That doesn't make any sense.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.988
 You know Georgie, you are
going to complete this course

10:14.114 --> 10:17.534
as fast as you can,
make nice sharp turns,

10:17.659 --> 10:19.160
and I think that
sounds like fun.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.912
 Yeah, that actually
does sound kind of fun.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.414
 OK.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.833
We've been putting way too
much pressure on ourselves,

10:24.958 --> 10:26.543
and I think it's getting to us.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.587
I mean, yes, this is hard
work, but we're also supposed

10:29.713 --> 10:30.588
to be enjoying it, right?

10:30.714 --> 10:31.923
 Yeah.
Sounds good to me.

10:32.048 --> 10:32.674
 OK.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.467
Let's go.

10:34.592 --> 10:35.802
 That's it.

10:35.927 --> 10:36.970
I want to see you
guys just having fun.

10:37.095 --> 10:37.971
Relax.

10:41.099 --> 10:41.766
 OK.

10:41.891 --> 10:42.642
Don't think about it.

10:42.767 --> 10:43.601
Just do it.

10:43.727 --> 10:44.769
There you go.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.440
 Nice.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.693
Oh, that was good, Georgie.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.194
 Hey, Val.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.237
 What's going on here?

10:54.362 --> 10:55.697
What's with the
miniature course?

10:55.822 --> 10:57.991
 We're just going
back to the basics.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.200
 The basics?

10:59.325 --> 11:01.202
The fall finale has
real jumps, remember?

11:01.327 --> 11:04.372
 Yes, and we are working
our way back to those.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.207
 Oh, well, that's good to hear.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.042
Take your time.

11:07.167 --> 11:07.834
 Val.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.377
 This is ridiculous.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.921
It's no wonder she's
going backwards, Amy.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.341
 I'm doing what I need
to do to get them ready.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.384
Can you please just
trust me to do my job?

11:19.971 --> 11:21.348
 Let me guess.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.725
Time for another break?

11:23.850 --> 11:33.485
[emotional music]

11:33.610 --> 11:36.571
 You were, uh, a little
scattered out there today.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.573
 Yeah, of course, I
have a stupid scholarship

11:38.698 --> 11:40.909
hanging over my head.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.243
 Stupid.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.413
 I just, I don't want
to talk about it, OK?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.248
 Right.

11:47.374 --> 11:51.336
Jade, can I tell
you a little story?

11:51.461 --> 11:52.212
[sigh]

11:52.337 --> 11:53.254
 OK.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.008
 When I was about
your age, there

11:57.133 --> 12:00.720
was a big trucking
company down on South,

12:00.845 --> 12:03.973
and they ran a rodeo series.

12:04.099 --> 12:09.604
They were looking for
one cowboy to sponsor,

12:09.729 --> 12:11.690
be the face of the whole thing.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.651
And it was big
money, but it meant

12:14.776 --> 12:19.197
being away from everything
for an entire season.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.949
 Let me guess,
you didn't take it,

12:21.074 --> 12:22.325
you missed your opportunity--

12:22.450 --> 12:26.287
 No, my friend turned
it down, and I took it.

12:26.413 --> 12:34.295
And it was incredible, but I
was away from home for a year

12:34.421 --> 12:36.923
and that was hard.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.134
But my career took
off after that,

12:39.259 --> 12:43.096
and I think every buckle
that I ever won was

12:43.221 --> 12:44.973
on account of that experience.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.394
 Well, what happened
to your friend?

12:49.519 --> 12:54.232
 He got a job, good
job, at a grain elevator.

12:54.357 --> 12:58.278
I think he's
probably still there,

12:58.403 --> 13:00.989
but he never had to
be homesick, right?

13:09.789 --> 13:12.417
 Look Val, I know it looks like
we're goofing around in there,

13:12.542 --> 13:13.877
but I needed that.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.004
Jumping hasn't been
much fun, lately.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.131
 At this level
Georgie, the fun is

13:18.256 --> 13:20.592
in accomplishing all the goals
you set out for yourself.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.052
 Winning.

13:22.177 --> 13:23.720
 Well, that is the
point of all of this.

13:23.845 --> 13:27.682
And with a horse like Flame, I'm
giving you every opportunity.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.976
But I think I made a mistake.

13:30.101 --> 13:34.481
Oh, no, I'm not blaming
you this is all my fault.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.483
I should have found a real
trainer for you right from the

13:36.608 --> 13:37.484
get go.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.903
 A real trainer?

13:40.028 --> 13:42.864
 Amy is amazing
at what she does,

13:42.989 --> 13:45.325
but this is so specialized,
and she's obviously distracted.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.201
 Well, yeah.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.285
She has a baby.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.203
 Exactly.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.704
Being a new mom's a lot of work.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.498
I get it.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.667
I wish I didn't have to, but
I think I need to let him go.

13:53.792 --> 13:54.626
 No.

13:54.751 --> 13:55.877
Amy's my trainer.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.254
 I knew this was
going to upset you,

13:58.380 --> 14:01.049
but now I need you to be able to
separate your personal feelings

14:01.174 --> 14:02.509
from the business of jumping.

14:02.634 --> 14:05.553
 This isn't
supposed to be a job.

14:05.679 --> 14:11.017
 Looks, I feel I
have to make a change.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.561
If you can't deal with
that, maybe I have to look

14:13.687 --> 14:15.980
for a new rider as well.

14:16.106 --> 14:20.568
[emotional music]

14:29.994 --> 14:33.164
 Hey, why did you bring him in?

14:33.289 --> 14:35.375
 I don't feel like
doing this right now.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.003
 Look, you can't let
Val get to you, Georgie.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.879
 It's kind of hard
not to do that.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.756
 I know she can
be a bit much, OK?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.883
But she's not going to change.

14:44.009 --> 14:45.135
So if you want to
keep riding Flame,

14:45.260 --> 14:46.761
than Val's expectations
are something

14:46.886 --> 14:48.138
you have to put up with.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.056
 Yeah, I'm starting to
wonder if it's worth it.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.891
 Hey, we can deal with her.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.560
 She went on and
on after you left.

14:53.685 --> 14:54.853
 About what?

14:54.978 --> 14:58.857
 Oh, I don't know
just the same,

14:58.982 --> 15:02.110
but it's getting exhausting.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.695
 OK, we'll take a break.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.280
But we're going to get
back at it this afternoon.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.448
Georgie.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.199
[sigh]

15:08.324 --> 15:10.076
 Can you believe she
wants to get rid of Amy?

15:10.201 --> 15:11.119
 No.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.454
That's super harsh.
- I know.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.496
I haven't told her yet.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.123
I don't know what
I'm going to say.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.751
 Well, maybe you don't
have to say anything.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.419
Maybe just kick
butt in practice,

15:19.544 --> 15:21.338
and you can show Val that
Amy's the right coach for you

15:21.463 --> 15:23.214
by clearing all the jumps.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.758
 You make it sound
like it's easy.

15:24.883 --> 15:25.633
 No.

15:25.759 --> 15:26.801
I know it's not.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.262
But I also know you can do it.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.473
 I wish I was as
positive as you are.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.059
[phone beeping]

15:34.184 --> 15:35.727
 It's Olivia again.

15:35.852 --> 15:36.936
 Posting about the formal?

15:37.062 --> 15:38.438
 Yeah.

15:38.563 --> 15:41.316
Yeah, it hasn't stopped,
but forgot about her.

15:41.441 --> 15:45.570
Actually, I think it
could be kind of fun,

15:45.695 --> 15:48.239
and I was actually thinking
about going myself,

15:48.365 --> 15:50.825
and I was wondering if
you wanted to go with me.

15:50.950 --> 15:55.288
 Honestly, it's
not really my thing.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.790
 Yeah, yeah.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.084
I just hope you're not
trying to save face.

15:59.209 --> 16:00.877
 What do you mean by that?

16:01.002 --> 16:02.962
 It's just, you don't have to
be some uppity girl like Olivia

16:03.088 --> 16:04.464
to enjoy it.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.508
I just mean, don't
feel embarrassed

16:06.633 --> 16:09.135
if you do want to go.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.554
 It's not that
I'm against going.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.972
It has nothing to
do with Olivia.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.141
The truth is, I I--

16:15.266 --> 16:17.310
I'm worried about giving
you the wrong idea.

16:17.435 --> 16:18.520
I mean, we're just friends.

16:20.814 --> 16:21.648
 I know.

16:21.773 --> 16:22.774
I know.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.150
I get it.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.653
So, you just want to
go as friends, then?

16:30.031 --> 16:31.950
 OK, as long as we're clear.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.535
 Crystal.

16:33.660 --> 16:39.124
[music playing]

16:39.249 --> 16:40.166
[knock on door]

16:40.291 --> 16:43.336
 Amy, may look who I found.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.171
 Hello.

16:45.296 --> 16:46.881
Hello.
Hello.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.008
 Welcome, Lou.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.928
 Oh, it's so good to be back.

16:52.053 --> 16:55.890
And you just keep getting
more and more beautiful

16:56.016 --> 16:57.517
every time I see you.

16:57.642 --> 16:58.518
[baby talks]

16:58.643 --> 17:01.187
 Yes you do.

17:01.312 --> 17:05.608
Oh, OK, now I'm glad dad
demanded I come back.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.319
He really is keyed up
to do this ride, hey?

17:08.444 --> 17:12.406
 Yeah, you know, Dad really
hasn't been Dad lately.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.867
 Yeah, I've noticed that too.

17:14.992 --> 17:18.454
 Why do you think it's
suddenly so important to him?

17:18.579 --> 17:22.000
 Oh, I gave up trying
to get inside your dad's

17:22.125 --> 17:24.252
had a long time ago.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.546
I'll just take you
bags up the house.

17:26.671 --> 17:27.756
 OK.

17:27.881 --> 17:34.137
[music playing]

17:34.262 --> 17:37.349
 So, I picked Lou
up at the airport.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.309
 Good.

17:39.434 --> 17:44.189
Well, I'm glad the whole
family's going to be together.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.066
How is she?

17:46.191 --> 17:48.526
 Well, she thinks
something's up.

17:48.651 --> 17:51.196
And so does Amy.

17:51.321 --> 17:54.866
This secret you're holding onto.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.451
you need to face it, Tim.

17:56.576 --> 18:00.622
We all need to face it together.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.957
 Or What?

18:03.083 --> 18:03.917
You're going to tell them?

18:04.042 --> 18:07.796
 No, I didn't say that.

18:07.921 --> 18:12.634
But I am starting to feel like
I'm lying to my own family.

18:12.759 --> 18:17.681
[emotional music]

18:17.806 --> 18:21.768
 Anyway, I just
thought you should know.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.400
[door opens]

18:28.525 --> 18:29.275
 Mom.

18:29.401 --> 18:30.485
 Hi!

18:30.610 --> 18:31.403
 Hey!

18:31.528 --> 18:32.570
 Oh, I'm so glad you're home.

18:32.696 --> 18:33.780
 Me too, sweetie.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.031
I missed you.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.491
This ride is going
to be so much fun.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.992
 Yeah.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.078
 I'm just planning our
family dinner for afterwards.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.538
 Oh, Wow.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.623
Looks delicious, but I'm
not going to be here.

18:43.748 --> 18:44.499
 What?

18:44.624 --> 18:45.709
Why not?

18:45.834 --> 18:47.127
 Uh, don't make a
big deal out of it,

18:47.252 --> 18:49.713
but Wyatt asked me
to this formal thing.

18:49.838 --> 18:50.964
 Oh.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.549
That sounds fun.

18:52.674 --> 18:53.883
Does that mean you two are--

18:54.009 --> 18:54.926
 No.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.094
We're just friends.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.971
 OK.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.347
But you still need a dress.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.515
 No, I already have
a dress, the one I

19:00.640 --> 19:01.975
wear to that barbecue with Amy?

19:02.100 --> 19:03.226
 That was a summer
dress, Georgie.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.519
You need something
new, something

19:04.644 --> 19:06.730
that's going to make a splash.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.189
We can go shopping
this afternoon.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.649
 No, I can't.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.359
I have a training
session I can't miss.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.652
Val's been all over me lately.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.112
 It's just one
training session.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.488
 Mm.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.032
No, she has me seriously
stressed out, Mom.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.783
 Well, that's not good.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.452
You want to talk about it?

19:20.577 --> 19:21.161
 It's OK.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.412
Later.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.914
 OK, but you
still need a dress.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.458
 It's too bad Katie's
away in Vancouver.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.501
she'd love to help me with that.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.837
Can I go get you a
dress on my own, please?

19:30.962 --> 19:31.921
 OK.

19:32.047 --> 19:32.964
Knock yourself out.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.132
- All right.
- Got to go.

19:34.257 --> 19:35.467
 See you in a bit.

19:35.592 --> 19:36.509
 Yeah.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.097
 Got your text.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.015
Here I am.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.516
 What is this about?

19:43.641 --> 19:45.101
 Well, I think you were right.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.562
Getting back to the basics
was exactly what I needed.

19:47.687 --> 19:51.024
I wanted to show Val
how much it's helped us.

19:51.149 --> 19:52.484
 All right.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.569
Let's see.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.487
[sigh]

19:55.612 --> 19:56.571
 OK, bud.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.745
[horse grunts]

20:06.247 --> 20:07.499
 That's it.

20:07.624 --> 20:08.416
 Nice.

20:12.212 --> 20:15.215
 Come on, stay relaxed.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.759
[horse jumps]

20:17.884 --> 20:22.097
[music plays]

20:22.222 --> 20:24.265
[horse jumps]

20:36.945 --> 20:40.990
 Well, I guess taking
time out of your training

20:41.116 --> 20:42.951
for a little bit of fun
wasn't the answer, huh?

20:43.076 --> 20:43.868
 Come on, Val.

20:43.993 --> 20:44.786
That's not fair.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.539
 No, don't bother Amy.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.416
Nothing about this
is fun anymore.

20:49.541 --> 20:50.959
Every time I'm going
up to that jump,

20:51.084 --> 20:53.294
all I can picture is how
mad you'll be if I miss it,

20:53.420 --> 20:55.797
or that fire Amy on the spot.

20:55.922 --> 20:56.965
 OK, let's not--

20:57.090 --> 20:58.550
 No, she wants to
find a new trainer,

20:58.675 --> 21:01.511
and I'm not OK with that.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.972
 The problem isn't
Amy, and it's not Flame.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.266
It-It-It's not me either.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.559
The problem is you, Val.

21:07.684 --> 21:10.061
You're the reason
this isn't working.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.438
 Really.

21:11.563 --> 21:13.356
You want to blame
me for all this?

21:13.481 --> 21:18.778
 No, what I'm saying is
I can't do this anymore.

21:18.903 --> 21:24.492
So find a new trainer, and a
new rider, because I'm done.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.910
I quit

21:26.036 --> 21:36.338
[emotional music]

21:36.463 --> 21:40.842
[music playing]

21:40.967 --> 21:41.885
[knock on door]

21:42.010 --> 21:42.969
 Come in.

21:43.094 --> 21:45.305
[door opens]

21:45.430 --> 21:48.224
 How are you doing?

21:48.350 --> 21:49.809
 I didn't sleep
very well last night.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.061
 Oh.

21:51.186 --> 21:53.938
 I'm really going to
miss jumping Flame.

21:54.064 --> 21:55.565
 You thinking about
going back to Val?

21:55.690 --> 21:56.358
 No.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.152
I can't stand her.

21:59.277 --> 22:03.239
I think I did the right
thing, but it still sucks.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.659
 I don't normally support
quitting on anything,

22:06.785 --> 22:10.205
but in this case, I'm
really proud of you.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.790
 Thanks.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.375
Is that the dress?

22:13.500 --> 22:14.209
 You wanna see it?

22:14.334 --> 22:15.669
 Yes.

22:15.794 --> 22:16.461
 OK.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.380
I really hope you like it.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.300
 It's beautiful.

22:22.425 --> 22:23.385
How much did you spend on this?

22:23.510 --> 22:24.761
 Don't worry.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.262
Your mom knows how
to find a bargain.

22:26.388 --> 22:27.639
Why don't you try it on?
- Yeah.

22:27.764 --> 22:28.723
I'll be down in a minute.

22:34.646 --> 22:35.522
 OK.

22:35.647 --> 22:36.898
Pancakes are ready.

22:37.023 --> 22:37.899
 Wow.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.109
What's all this?

22:39.234 --> 22:40.360
 I thought this
was appropriate.

22:40.485 --> 22:41.736
I used to make these
for your mother.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.488
It's pretty much the
only thing I did make.

22:43.613 --> 22:47.951
Anyway, we should have a good
breakfast before this ride.

22:48.076 --> 22:50.370
 Oh, sweetheart,
you look so grown up.

22:50.495 --> 22:52.247
 You look beautiful.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.790
 Thanks.

22:53.915 --> 22:54.874
Now, why don't you run
upstairs and change, OK?

22:55.000 --> 22:55.750
 Yeah.

22:55.875 --> 22:56.918
 Come down, grab some pancakes.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.169
 Sure.

22:58.294 --> 22:59.587
 Jack, would you take
over for me, please?

22:59.713 --> 23:01.589
I'm going to get the
horses packed up.

23:01.715 --> 23:05.051
Let's get this show on the road.

23:05.176 --> 23:11.057
[music playing]

23:39.169 --> 23:39.961
 Hey, Jen.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.463
 Hey.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.881
Thank you so much for
looking after Wendy.

23:43.006 --> 23:44.466
Her schedule and
everything's in the kitchen.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.051
 Yeah, don't worry.
We'll be fine.

23:46.176 --> 23:47.385
 OK.

23:47.510 --> 23:49.095
 And I'll be around
too, just in case

23:49.220 --> 23:52.599
that kid needs to be hog tied
into a diaper, or whatever.

23:55.185 --> 23:55.977
 Hey.

23:56.102 --> 23:56.895
 Hey.

23:57.020 --> 23:58.146
 How is the diner this morning?

23:58.271 --> 23:59.439
 Great.
Busy.

23:59.564 --> 24:00.648
 Good.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.152
 Hey.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.487
 Hey.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.404
 I will see you later.

24:06.529 --> 24:09.115
 OK.

24:09.240 --> 24:13.203
 So I uh, I brought Venus
over from the dude ranch.

24:13.328 --> 24:14.746
 You didn't have to do that.

24:14.871 --> 24:18.458
 I know, but she's your
favorite horse to ride, so.

24:18.583 --> 24:19.668
 Thank you.

24:24.047 --> 24:26.007
 Come on.

24:26.132 --> 24:31.930
[music plays]

24:32.055 --> 24:36.267

[leaves rustling]

24:47.320 --> 24:57.706
[horse neighs]

24:57.831 --> 25:01.459
 Not many rides like
this in New York City.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.294
 No.

25:03.420 --> 25:04.337
I miss it.

25:04.462 --> 25:06.339
 Riding?

25:06.464 --> 25:08.133
 Everything.

25:08.258 --> 25:09.759
 It's like you said.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.219
You won't be there forever.

25:11.344 --> 25:12.387
 Yeah.

25:12.512 --> 25:14.389
I know.

25:14.514 --> 25:17.892
 Oh, your mom would have
been so proud of you.

25:18.018 --> 25:19.310
 I don't know.

25:19.436 --> 25:21.396
She wasn't exactly thrilled
when I went to New York

25:21.521 --> 25:23.023
the first time.

25:23.148 --> 25:26.192
 Well, no one wants to
see their child move away.

25:26.317 --> 25:29.195
That doesn't mean she
wasn't proud of everything

25:29.320 --> 25:30.739
you've accomplished.

25:34.367 --> 25:35.285
 She was.

25:35.410 --> 25:36.244
Trust me.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.791
 You go on up
ahead and doing Dad.

25:41.916 --> 25:44.127
You two should be
leading this thing.

25:44.252 --> 25:45.211
 OK.

25:48.631 --> 25:52.093
[horse neighs]

25:57.015 --> 26:00.268
 So what was she
like, your mom?

26:00.393 --> 26:01.686
 You would have loved her.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.813
 She was a really
strong person.

26:03.938 --> 26:05.982
 So passionate about horses.

26:06.107 --> 26:08.610
 Yeah, but she was
always there for us.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.320
If we needed to be picked up,

26:10.445 --> 26:14.824
 Or if we needed a good swift
kick in the butt, she had too.

26:14.949 --> 26:17.744
 She was not afraid
to speak her mind,

26:17.869 --> 26:19.913
but she always had our back.

26:20.038 --> 26:21.456
Always.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.458
 She was a lot
like you, actually.

26:23.583 --> 26:28.463
Like what you did the other day,
quitting on Val to protect me.

26:28.588 --> 26:32.300
 That means a lot, but
that's not the reason I quit.

26:32.425 --> 26:34.010
Not entirely.

26:34.135 --> 26:37.347
 Well, I appreciate you
trying to protect me,

26:37.472 --> 26:42.060
and I love coaching you,
Georgie, but maybe Val's right.

26:42.185 --> 26:44.020
Maybe someone else
could take you further.

26:44.145 --> 26:44.771
 No.

26:44.896 --> 26:46.314
That's not true.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.149
You're a great coach.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.150
I didn't quit for you.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.194
I quit for me.

26:51.319 --> 26:55.657
It feel so good just to ride,
again, out here with Phoenix,

26:55.782 --> 26:58.118
just doing what I love to do.

27:03.581 --> 27:08.086
[music playing]

27:38.825 --> 27:39.784
 Thanks for this.

27:39.909 --> 27:41.703
This was a-- was a great idea.

27:48.293 --> 27:50.837
 Boy, every time
I come up here,

27:50.962 --> 27:53.048
reminds me of when
Marion was just a girl.

27:55.550 --> 28:01.014
She was always off riding
on a trail somewhere.

28:01.139 --> 28:05.894
One time, Lindy and I lost
track of her for an entire day.

28:06.019 --> 28:08.897
Boy, we looked everywhere.

28:09.022 --> 28:12.817
And I finally found
her way up here,

28:12.942 --> 28:18.698
just staring out at all this.

28:18.823 --> 28:24.537
Said she was up here for hours
already, almost in a daze.

28:24.662 --> 28:28.083
She thought this was the most
beautiful place on Earth.

28:30.835 --> 28:34.589
This is Marion's spot.

28:34.714 --> 28:39.886
And I stand here now, looking
out at all these mountains,

28:40.011 --> 28:46.851
and I can almost feel
it right here with me.

28:54.275 --> 28:57.862
 There's something
I need to say,

28:57.987 --> 29:05.036
because being here brings back
different feelings for me,

29:05.161 --> 29:15.046
feelings of pain, guilt.
I'm sure that Marion spent

29:15.171 --> 29:21.094
countless hours here
trying to figure out just

29:21.219 --> 29:25.515
what was wrong with her husband,
how she was going to keep

29:25.640 --> 29:26.808
our young family together.

29:29.477 --> 29:32.230
I hurt her.

29:32.355 --> 29:34.065
And she did not deserve it.

29:38.528 --> 29:42.949
I know where I put
you through Marion,

29:43.074 --> 29:44.492
when I put our family through.

29:48.455 --> 29:51.207
And today's not
about looking back,

29:51.332 --> 29:52.834
it's about moving forward.

29:55.879 --> 30:00.633
but I need you to know that
I worked hard on my recovery.

30:00.759 --> 30:04.179
And there was just one
piece of that program

30:04.304 --> 30:06.931
that I was too afraid to finish.

30:10.685 --> 30:18.818
I just couldn't say I
was sorry, not to you.

30:23.239 --> 30:24.866
So I want to say it today.

30:29.954 --> 30:38.463
I want to say in front of our
family, Marion, I'm sorry.

30:42.967 --> 30:48.765
I'm so sorry for everything.

30:48.890 --> 31:00.985

[falcon caws]

[music plays]

31:22.632 --> 31:25.552
 Hey.

31:25.677 --> 31:26.970
 Oh my God, what time is it?

31:27.095 --> 31:30.557
 It's exactly the time
I said I'd pick you up.

31:30.682 --> 31:34.019
 I'm sorry, I guess the ride
went longer than I thought.

31:34.144 --> 31:35.478
 Nice suit, you look good.

31:35.603 --> 31:36.771
I'll get changed.

31:36.896 --> 31:38.606
 OK, um, hold on.

31:38.732 --> 31:40.066
Hold on, hold on.

31:40.191 --> 31:42.861
As much as I would love
to see your dress, maybe

31:42.986 --> 31:44.195
I should get changed.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.697
I got jeans and a
t-shirt in the car.

31:45.822 --> 31:47.240
- Seriously?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:47.365 --> 31:48.908
I've got like half my life
in the trunk of the car.

31:49.034 --> 31:51.494
 No, I mean, why
would you get changed?

31:51.619 --> 31:53.747
 I can see you're enjoying
your time with Phoenix.

31:53.872 --> 31:56.791
So get him tucked up, get me
a horse, I'll go for a ride.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.043
 Really?

31:58.168 --> 31:59.586
 Well, what would be more fun?

31:59.711 --> 32:01.463
Comparing dresses
with Olivia at formal,

32:01.588 --> 32:04.799
or watching the
sunset on horseback?

32:04.924 --> 32:08.970
[music playing]

32:24.444 --> 32:25.987
 What are you doing
here all by yourself?

32:29.074 --> 32:32.869
 Some people have
a spot, a place

32:32.994 --> 32:39.584
they go to contemplate
their thoughts,

32:39.709 --> 32:42.921
and I guess this is mine.

32:43.046 --> 32:44.130
The rodeo.

32:47.342 --> 32:50.679
It's given me some of my
biggest highs, and lows.

32:54.766 --> 32:59.688
But just being here
makes me feel alive.

33:02.732 --> 33:03.608
 Yeah.

33:03.733 --> 33:04.609
Me too.

33:09.948 --> 33:11.741
 I know you're struggling
with this decision

33:11.866 --> 33:13.785
about whether to take
the scholarship or not,

33:13.910 --> 33:16.996
and I understand.

33:17.122 --> 33:19.207
Just let me know either way.

33:24.379 --> 33:26.339
 I won't be disappointed
if you say no.

33:29.426 --> 33:30.385
 Well, I've decided.

33:33.847 --> 33:36.224
I'm going to go.

33:36.349 --> 33:37.225
 Really?

33:41.229 --> 33:44.065
 Everything I learned
here, everything

33:44.190 --> 33:52.866
I've learned from you, can't
go to waste, and you're right.

33:52.991 --> 33:54.242
It's something I need to do.

33:58.997 --> 33:59.748
 You won't regret it.

34:07.005 --> 34:10.257
 Well, I leave tomorrow,
so I got to go pack.

34:13.803 --> 34:17.014
 Jade, stop by here, OK?

34:17.139 --> 34:18.850
Tomorrow, before we leave.

34:18.975 --> 34:20.060
 OK.

34:24.731 --> 34:27.984
 Is there something
you're not telling me?

34:28.109 --> 34:29.527
 About what?
The school?

34:29.652 --> 34:30.527
 No.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.447
About you.

34:32.572 --> 34:34.114
You're sitting here
all by yourself.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.743
It's pretty weird.

34:36.868 --> 34:39.329
It just seems like over the
last little while, you just--

34:39.454 --> 34:40.455
you haven't been yourself.

34:49.089 --> 34:50.130
 I'm good.

34:53.885 --> 34:55.804
 OK.

34:55.929 --> 35:02.727
[music plays]

35:02.852 --> 35:04.312
[sigh]

35:09.192 --> 35:09.943
 Hey.

35:10.068 --> 35:10.944
Hi.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.404
 Hey.

35:12.529 --> 35:14.239
 Just wanted to see
how you two were doing.

35:14.364 --> 35:15.824
 Better now.

35:15.949 --> 35:18.827
 Pretty emotional day,
Dad, what you set up there.

35:18.952 --> 35:20.286
 Yeah.

35:20.412 --> 35:22.664
Well, I meant every word of it.

35:22.789 --> 35:26.126
 It was beautiful, Dad.

35:26.251 --> 35:31.297
 Yeah, I was trying to figure
out what that Shaman meant.

35:31.423 --> 35:32.298
 What, Altan?

35:32.424 --> 35:33.800
What did he say to you?

35:33.925 --> 35:38.972
 When he said that I had
a shadow hanging over me,

35:39.097 --> 35:42.809
you know, I think that that
had to do with your mother.

35:42.934 --> 35:44.936
 When did you see a shaman?

35:45.061 --> 35:49.149
 You know, I realized
I can't bury things.

35:49.274 --> 35:50.775
Not anymore.

35:50.900 --> 35:53.820
It's not good for me,
It's not good for anyone.

35:56.448 --> 36:01.286
I need to tell you something,
and I don't want you to panic.

36:01.411 --> 36:02.829
 Dad, what is this about?

36:02.954 --> 36:07.042
 I went in for a
checkup, and Dr. Virani

36:07.167 --> 36:09.210
had me get an MRI on my brain.

36:09.336 --> 36:10.128
 Why-- why would you--

36:10.253 --> 36:11.004
You got an MRI?

36:11.129 --> 36:13.298
 Just a sec.

36:15.884 --> 36:20.013
They found something,
but it could be nothing.

36:20.138 --> 36:24.392
Or it could be bad.

36:27.020 --> 36:28.021
 How bad?

36:28.146 --> 36:28.897
 We don't know yet.

36:34.944 --> 36:36.321
 I'm gonna positive.

36:36.446 --> 36:40.825
[emotional music]

36:45.705 --> 36:46.539
 Hey.

36:46.664 --> 36:47.582
 Hey.

36:47.707 --> 36:50.168
 I couldn't sleep last night.

36:50.293 --> 36:51.836
How are you doing?

36:51.961 --> 36:52.754
 You heard my Dad said.

36:52.879 --> 36:54.506
It's probably nothing.

36:54.631 --> 36:55.382
 Yeah.

36:55.507 --> 36:56.257
We don't know that.

36:56.383 --> 36:57.592
I mean, what if it's--

36:57.717 --> 36:59.386
 It's not.

36:59.511 --> 37:01.096
 Amy, but what if it is?

37:01.221 --> 37:03.598
I mean, what is that gonna mean?

37:03.723 --> 37:07.185
 Lou, we can't obsess
about the what ifs.

37:07.310 --> 37:08.103
OK?

37:08.228 --> 37:10.230
You heard Dad.

37:10.355 --> 37:12.023
He's going to be fine.

37:12.148 --> 37:13.817
[baby cries]

37:13.942 --> 37:15.610
 I-- I need to go.

37:15.735 --> 37:16.611
 OK, go.

37:25.412 --> 37:27.247
 Morning Lou.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.752
What's wrong?

37:32.877 --> 37:35.130
 You know about Dad.

37:35.255 --> 37:38.633
 He told you.

37:38.758 --> 37:39.426
 Yea.

37:39.551 --> 37:41.386
And I've been away.

37:41.511 --> 37:44.180
I haven't even
been here for him.

37:44.305 --> 37:45.849
 I'm sure he's going to--

37:45.974 --> 37:48.309
 I don't want to hear that
he's going to be OK, Grandpa.

37:48.435 --> 37:51.396
 I just want--

37:51.521 --> 37:52.480
I don't know what I want.

37:56.401 --> 37:57.986
I'm scared, Grandpa.

37:58.111 --> 38:00.780
I can't lose him.

38:00.905 --> 38:01.823
I'm scared.

38:17.213 --> 38:18.006
 Hey.

38:18.131 --> 38:19.132
 Hey.

38:19.257 --> 38:20.759
Tim told me you were going.

38:20.884 --> 38:22.302
 Yeah.

38:22.427 --> 38:23.845
Look, I'm sorry I didn't call.

38:23.970 --> 38:28.725
I-- It's just um, you're
like one of my best friends,

38:28.850 --> 38:30.602
and I thought that
if we talked, it

38:30.727 --> 38:32.520
might make me want to not go.

38:32.645 --> 38:33.813
 You don't need explain.

38:33.938 --> 38:37.484
Just came to do
this for good luck.

38:37.609 --> 38:38.651
 Come here kid.

38:43.615 --> 38:44.699
 I'll see you soon.

38:44.824 --> 38:45.700
 Yeah.

38:48.787 --> 38:49.621
 OK.

38:49.746 --> 38:50.914
I'm here.

38:51.039 --> 38:52.374
I don't have a lot of
time because my mom's

38:52.499 --> 38:53.541
driving me to the airport, so--

38:53.667 --> 38:54.668
 OK, thanks for coming.

38:57.420 --> 39:02.676
I won these at saddle bronc
champ, Calgary stampede.

39:02.801 --> 39:06.304
I've worn them
every rodeo since.

39:06.429 --> 39:07.681
They're yours now.

39:13.269 --> 39:14.813
 Thank you.

39:14.938 --> 39:16.564
For everything.

39:16.690 --> 39:17.691
 Well, you earned it.

39:20.819 --> 39:22.070
I'm going to miss you.

39:22.195 --> 39:24.364
 Yeah, me too.

39:24.489 --> 39:25.323
 You know, I'm--

39:25.448 --> 39:26.408
I'm proud of you.

39:29.244 --> 39:30.245
 OK.

39:30.370 --> 39:31.371
You want to squeeze me so hard.

39:31.496 --> 39:32.372
I'll be back for
Christmas break.

39:32.497 --> 39:33.873
 OK, right.

39:33.998 --> 39:35.625
You'd better call me
before then, though.

39:35.750 --> 39:36.918
 OK.

39:37.043 --> 39:39.254
 I want to know what's
going on down there.

39:39.379 --> 39:40.839
 I will.

39:40.964 --> 39:41.756
Bye.

39:45.051 --> 39:46.511
 Right.

39:46.636 --> 39:50.098
[music playing]

40:02.027 --> 40:04.029
 Hey Georgie, any
idea why there's

40:04.154 --> 40:05.113
a Westfield trailer here?

40:10.535 --> 40:12.120
 Hey.

40:12.245 --> 40:13.204
Your trailer showed up at
heartland to pick up Flame.

40:13.329 --> 40:14.706
Why?

40:14.831 --> 40:15.915
 OK, I can explain.

40:16.041 --> 40:18.752
 You're riding him
now, is that it?

40:18.877 --> 40:21.046
Wow, was Wyatt ever
right about you.

40:21.171 --> 40:22.088
 Oh, Yeah?

40:22.213 --> 40:23.590
 Yeah.

40:23.715 --> 40:25.258
He said you were angling
for this the whole time.

40:25.383 --> 40:26.426
I can't believe I trusted you.

40:26.551 --> 40:28.470
 Yeah, I heard
back from my vet.

40:28.595 --> 40:31.139
He's putting Arrow on stall
rest into the end of the season.

40:31.264 --> 40:33.767
I wasn't angling on anything.

40:33.892 --> 40:36.227
But somebody needs to John
Flame i the fall finale.

40:36.353 --> 40:37.771
You're the one who quit.

40:37.896 --> 40:40.065
 You've got exactly
what you were after.

40:40.190 --> 40:43.568
 No, not yet.

40:43.693 --> 40:44.819
I want to win this thing.

40:51.701 --> 40:52.660
 Dylan's riding Flame now.

40:52.786 --> 40:53.995
That's why his trailer was here.

40:54.120 --> 40:55.080
 Wow.

40:55.205 --> 40:56.873
Val didn't waste
any time, did she?

40:56.998 --> 40:58.583
 I'm so mad at both of them.

40:58.708 --> 41:00.335
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.796
 I think I have an idea.

41:02.921 --> 41:05.590
I was watching you and
Phoenix on the ride yesterday.

41:05.715 --> 41:09.678
You two still have
quite the connection.

41:09.803 --> 41:10.512
 Yeah.

41:10.637 --> 41:11.846
Of course we do.

41:11.971 --> 41:13.640
We basically arrived
here together.

41:13.765 --> 41:14.766
 Wouldn't it be
cool if you could

41:14.891 --> 41:17.352
win the fall finale with him?

41:17.477 --> 41:18.895
 What?

41:19.020 --> 41:20.897
 Georgie, you don't have
to give up your dream.

41:21.022 --> 41:24.442
You just need to
find the right horse.

41:24.567 --> 41:25.694
 You'd train us?

41:25.819 --> 41:28.655
 I think you're stuck with me.

41:28.780 --> 41:29.447
 OK.

41:29.572 --> 41:30.532
Yeah, let's do it.

41:30.657 --> 41:31.700
Let's be Val and Dylan.

41:31.825 --> 41:32.534
 Great.

41:32.659 --> 41:34.744

 Hey.

Just the two girls
I was looking for.

41:40.166 --> 41:42.669
 Really?

41:42.794 --> 41:47.090
 All the reminiscing
about your mom

41:47.215 --> 41:51.553
brought back memories for me,
from when you were a baby.

41:55.598 --> 41:57.726
There's something I think
you and I should do together.

42:06.526 --> 42:08.194
 Boo!

42:08.319 --> 42:10.196
Oh, my God.

42:11.489 --> 42:12.824

42:12.949 --> 42:16.369

He's riding Flame now.

42:18.788 --> 42:21.499
 Oh, I'm sorry, but
I'm not surprised.

42:21.624 --> 42:22.917
 It's OK.

42:23.043 --> 42:23.710
It's fine.

42:23.835 --> 42:25.253
Just forget about him.

42:25.378 --> 42:27.589
I'm-- I'm going to ride
Phoenix in the fall finale.

42:27.714 --> 42:28.423
 That's great.

42:28.548 --> 42:29.382
 Yeah.

42:29.507 --> 42:30.717
 Yeah.

42:30.842 --> 42:32.010
 Is that why you
wanted to meet me?

42:32.135 --> 42:34.763
You wanted to tell
me that stuff?

42:34.888 --> 42:36.389
 No, I--

42:36.514 --> 42:39.476
I wanted to say that I had a
really great time yesterday.

42:39.601 --> 42:43.063
The ride was amazing, and
I'm glad that you get me.

42:43.188 --> 42:44.230
 Yeah, Yeah.

42:44.356 --> 42:46.441
I had a lot of fun too.

42:46.566 --> 42:47.776
I always do when we hang out.

42:50.487 --> 42:52.572
 Yeah, me too.

42:52.697 --> 42:55.533
I also came here to do this.

just about this age

43:10.131 --> 43:12.092

did this with you.

43:14.094 --> 43:14.886
Yeah.

things, little things, little--

Don't let them pass you by.
