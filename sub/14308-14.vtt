PRESTON CAMPING TRIP!

00:20.067 --> 00:21.533
BIRD CALLER.

00:21.567 --> 00:23.400
- AFFIRMATIVE, TOTES,
YUPPERS.

00:23.433 --> 00:25.567
- PACKED, ORGANIZED,
AND READY TO GO!

00:25.600 --> 00:27.600
- YE-EAH!

00:32.000 --> 00:33.833
- MAKING FRANKIE JEALOUS
BY SHOWING HER

00:33.867 --> 00:36.833
ALL THE COOL CAMPING GEAR!
- FRANKIE.

00:36.867 --> 00:38.300
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN CAMPING?

00:38.333 --> 00:39.700
- WE'RE FROM NEW YORK.

00:39.733 --> 00:41.533
MOM'S IDEA OF CAMPING
WAS HAVING US

00:41.567 --> 00:45.900
SLEEP IN THE LIVING ROOM
WITH THE NATURE CHANNEL ON.

00:45.933 --> 00:48.400
WITH ONE PULL OF THE CORD,

00:48.433 --> 00:51.300
IT BLOWS UP INTO
A HUGE RAFT!

00:51.333 --> 00:53.533
- NOT IN HERE, IT DOESN'T.

00:53.567 --> 00:54.867
I TOLD YOU FIVE TIMES--

00:54.900 --> 00:57.400
ONLY ADULTS CAN OPERATE
THIS EQUIPMENT.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.667
- HATE IT WHEN YOU TREAT ME
LIKE A LITTLE KID!

00:59.700 --> 01:02.833
I HATE IT, I HATE IT,
I HATE IT!

01:02.867 --> 01:05.800
- OOH! CAMPING.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.067
FUNZIES.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.267
I WISH WE GOT
THE NATURE CHANNEL HERE.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.667
- MM.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.267
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:12.300 --> 01:13.800
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
COME WITH US?

01:13.833 --> 01:15.900
- THAT'D BE AWESOME!

01:15.933 --> 01:18.067
I JUST NEED
A TOOTHBRUSH, FLASHLIGHT,

01:18.067 --> 01:19.600
AND A COUPLE
OF MY MANNEQUIN HEADS.

01:19.633 --> 01:21.667
I'LL PROBABLY BRING
TANYA AND BIG GURT.

01:21.700 --> 01:24.067
THEY'RE THE MOST OUTDOORSY.

01:24.067 --> 01:27.533
- I'M NOT SURE.
IT'S KINDA LAST-MINUTE.

01:27.567 --> 01:28.933
- OMG! TMI.

01:28.967 --> 01:33.267
ROFLAGPWATTHYO!

01:33.300 --> 01:34.800
FRANKIE, LOOK OUT.

01:36.900 --> 01:39.367
- MICHELLE, I HATE TO BE
BUDDY BUTINSKY,

01:39.400 --> 01:41.267
OR TOMMY TWO CENTS OR--

01:41.300 --> 01:42.767
- MILES.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.700
- CAMPING MIGHT BE GOOD
FOR TAY.

01:44.733 --> 01:46.900
IT'S A CHANCE TO DISCONNECT
WITH HER PHONE

01:46.933 --> 01:48.067
AND RECONNECT
WITH HER FAMILY.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.800
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MILES.

01:49.833 --> 01:52.400
TAYLOR, YOU COULD USE
A TECHNOLOGY BREAK.

01:52.433 --> 01:54.400
- NO, THANKS.
I ALREADY ATE.

01:54.433 --> 01:56.767
- THIS'LL DO THE TRICK.

01:58.333 --> 02:01.500
CAMPING?
WITHOUT MY PHONE?

02:01.533 --> 02:03.700
NOOOOOO!

02:03.733 --> 02:05.633
- LOL.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.667
SEND.

02:12.067 --> 02:14.633
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:14.667 --> 02:17.433
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:17.467 --> 02:20.267
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:20.300 --> 02:23.500
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:23.533 --> 02:25.700
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:25.733 --> 02:27.300
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:27.333 --> 02:30.067
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:30.067 --> 02:32.900
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:32.933 --> 02:34.733
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:34.767 --> 02:38.667
*

02:38.700 --> 02:40.500
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:40.533 --> 02:42.833
*

02:47.533 --> 02:49.467
- I LOVE HEADING
TO THE GREAT OUTDOORS

02:49.500 --> 02:51.133
WITH ONLY
THE BARE ESSENTIALS.

02:51.167 --> 02:53.367
- READY FOR THE WILDERNESS!

02:53.400 --> 02:56.067
ANYONE WANNA GIVE ME A HAND
WITH THE REST OF IT?

02:56.067 --> 02:58.133
- WELL, YEAH.

02:58.167 --> 02:59.900
THIS IS JUST EVENINGWEAR.

03:00.067 --> 03:01.200
- OH, NO.

03:01.233 --> 03:03.800
CAMPING IS ALL ABOUT
ROUGHING IT.

03:08.233 --> 03:11.067
- OKAY. NOW I'M READY.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.767
- FORGET ALL THAT.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.600
EVERYTHING YOU NEED
TO SURVIVE IN THE WILDERNESS

03:14.633 --> 03:17.067
IS...RIGHT UP HERE.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.900
SO LET'S FINISH
LOADING UP THE CAR!

03:19.933 --> 03:22.533
HAH HAH HAH!

03:22.567 --> 03:24.067
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE GOING TO

03:24.067 --> 03:25.800
SLEEP IN THE WOODS
ON PURPOSE.

03:25.833 --> 03:28.567
WHAT'S WITH THE SCARF?

03:28.600 --> 03:30.067
- IT'S A KERCHIEF!

03:30.067 --> 03:32.867
AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

03:32.900 --> 03:36.800
THEY ONLY AWARD IT TO THOSE
FEW SELECT GHOST SCOUTS.

03:36.833 --> 03:39.167
WHO GOT THEIR ORDER FORM IN
ON TIME.

03:42.567 --> 03:45.767
- HEY.
THERE'S THAT COOL RAFT.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.867
- YEP. THERE IT IS.

03:48.900 --> 03:52.467
- OPENING IT WOULD BE WRONG.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.067
- SO VERY WRONG.

03:55.067 --> 03:56.900
WHOO!

03:56.933 --> 03:59.467
- THIS IS AWESOME!

03:59.500 --> 04:04.533
- HERE COMES THE RAPIDS!
LOOK OUT FOR...

04:04.567 --> 04:07.100
ANGRY DAD!
REVERSE COURSE, REVERSE COURSE!

04:07.133 --> 04:09.600
- LOUIE!

04:10.600 --> 04:13.167
- THESE TWO HAPPENED!

04:13.200 --> 04:15.200
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
NOT TO TOUCH THAT?

04:15.233 --> 04:16.767
YOU GUYS COULD HAVE
GOTTEN HURT.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.433
- WHY DO YOU GROWNUPS
ALWAYS SAY THAT?

04:19.467 --> 04:20.733
- BECAUSE UNLIKE KIDS,

04:20.767 --> 04:22.467
WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
CONSEQUENCES.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.067
AND HERE'S ONE--
YOU CAN'T GO CAMPING NOW.

04:25.067 --> 04:26.633
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

04:26.667 --> 04:29.133
CAN I AT LEAST
TELL YOU MY SIDE?

04:29.167 --> 04:31.433
- NO. IT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU'RE GONNA LEARN.

04:31.467 --> 04:33.967
- DARN WE'LL GO ANOTHER TIME.
WHERE'S MY PHONE?

04:34.067 --> 04:36.200
- WE'RE STILL GOING.

04:36.233 --> 04:37.833
JUST NOT LOUIE.

04:37.867 --> 04:39.567
I'LL GET HIM
A GHOST SITTER.

04:39.600 --> 04:44.067
- WAIT. IT WAS MY IDEA.
I'M THE PUPPET MASTER HERE.

04:44.067 --> 04:46.433
- IN THAT CASE,
YOU'RE NOT GOING EITHER.

04:46.467 --> 04:50.600
- OH...DID NOT
THINK THAT ONE THROUGH.

04:50.633 --> 04:52.833
- I'LL CALL MRS. GUNDERSON.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.767
NOT HER!

04:54.800 --> 04:59.467
SHE'S A TYRANT!
AND SO MANY WARTS...

04:59.500 --> 05:02.200
- SHE'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU TWO NEED.

05:04.733 --> 05:08.767
- HEY! LOOK AT ME
DISREGARDING RULES!

05:08.800 --> 05:11.967
YOU CAN'T TRUST ME!
I'M A LOOSE CANNON!

05:14.900 --> 05:17.967
- ALL RIGHTY, AS SOON AS
MRS. GUNDERSON GETS HERE,

05:18.067 --> 05:20.200
WE'RE OFF.
SHE'S ALWAYS ON TIME.

05:20.233 --> 05:24.667
SHE SHOULD BE
HERE IN FOUR, THREE, TWO--

05:24.700 --> 05:26.533
ROSALYN!
YOU'RE EARLY.

05:26.567 --> 05:28.100
- I'M EXACTLY ON TIME.

05:28.133 --> 05:31.867
YOUR WATCH IS TWO SECONDS SLOW.
FIX IT!

05:31.900 --> 05:34.867
- HI, MRS. GUNDERSON.
I'M MICHELLE--

05:34.900 --> 05:36.433
- HUNCHED LIKE A GARGOYLE!

05:36.467 --> 05:37.800
STAND UP STRAIGHT!

05:37.833 --> 05:40.867
YOU'RE A LADY!

05:40.900 --> 05:42.900
- THANKS FOR CALLING THAT
TO MY ATTENTION.

05:47.133 --> 05:50.800
- UH, I-I'M DOING FINE,
MRS. GUNDERWARTS--

05:50.833 --> 05:52.467
I MEAN, WARTERSON--

05:52.500 --> 05:54.767
I MEAN--WARTS!

05:57.067 --> 05:58.733
- TAYLOR.

05:58.767 --> 06:00.200
IT'S 80 DEGREES OUT.

06:00.233 --> 06:02.500
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
TRYING TO HIDE YOUR PHONE.

06:02.533 --> 06:03.800
HAND IT OVER.
- WOW.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.767
YOU'RE GOOD, MOM.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.867
- TEENAGERS. THEY ALWAYS THINK
THEY'RE SMARTER THAN WE ARE.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.233
AM I RIGHT?
- YOU'RE A SIMPLETON.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.633
HOW'D ALL THIS GET HERE?

06:17.667 --> 06:19.067
WEIRD.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.933
- YOU MUST BE GUNDERSON.

06:24.967 --> 06:28.167
HOW DO YOU DO?
- I DO VERY WELL, THANK YOU.

06:28.200 --> 06:31.067
- THE DAY IS YOUNG.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.600
- YOU THINK YOU'RE CUTE,
TINY HIPSTER?

06:36.767 --> 06:39.500
YOU'RE A MONSTER!

06:39.533 --> 06:41.133
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.133
WHERE'S THE OTHER ONE?

06:43.167 --> 06:44.900
- I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN A WHILE.

06:44.933 --> 06:46.633
HE'S PROBABLY
STILL MAD AT ME.

06:49.067 --> 06:51.433
- LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT A STOWAWAY.

06:51.467 --> 06:52.567
LOUIE.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.133
- NO, I AM-A LUIGI,

06:54.167 --> 06:55.700
A FUN-LOVING SOCCER BALL.

06:55.733 --> 06:58.767
LET'S

06:58.800 --> 07:01.067
- LOUIE,
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU.

07:01.067 --> 07:03.167
UPSTAIRS--NOW!

07:03.200 --> 07:05.600
- I NO KNOW THIS LOUIE
YOU SPEAK OF.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.533
PEPPERONI-A PIZZA!

07:10.100 --> 07:13.600
- SON, YOU COME OUT OF
THAT BALL OR I'M COMING IN!

07:13.633 --> 07:15.067
- YOU CAN'T.
WE BOTH KNOW

07:15.100 --> 07:18.200
ONLY ONE GHOST CAN POSSESS
AN OBJECT AT A TIME!

07:18.233 --> 07:20.800
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

07:22.067 --> 07:23.433
- HEY, YOU CAN'T
GET IN HERE TOO.

07:23.467 --> 07:24.900
- LET'S GO, LOUIE! OUT!

07:24.933 --> 07:28.100
- I'M-A LUIGI!
- NO, YOU'RE NOT!

07:28.133 --> 07:31.533
- OOF!
- UHH!

07:31.567 --> 07:33.567
- AH...WE'RE LUCKY, LOUIS.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.467
TWO GHOSTS POSSESSING AN OBJECT
AT THE SAME TIME--

07:36.500 --> 07:38.600
SOMETHING BAD
COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

07:43.833 --> 07:47.133
- I FEEL WEIRD, POPS.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.067
- AAH!
- AAH!

07:49.067 --> 07:52.067
- YOU LOOK LIKE ME!
- YOU LOOK LIKE ME!

07:53.433 --> 07:54.967
- WE SWITCHED FORMS!

07:57.067 --> 07:58.800
SON, THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

07:58.833 --> 08:02.567
NOW I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO
GET US BACK TO NORMAL.

08:02.600 --> 08:03.967
LOUIE?

08:04.067 --> 08:06.100
LOUIE...

08:06.133 --> 08:08.233
OH, THAT KID'S IN TROUBLE
NOW!

08:10.567 --> 08:12.900
WHAT THE--

08:12.933 --> 08:14.833
- YOU'RE NOT SNAPPING
ANYWHERE.

08:14.867 --> 08:17.067
- DON'T TELL ME YOU'VE FORGOTTEN

08:17.100 --> 08:19.867
ABOUT THE FAMOUS
GUNDERSON MITTENS!

08:19.900 --> 08:21.833
AS LONG AS THESE
ARE ON YOUR HANDS,

08:21.867 --> 08:24.467
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY GHOSTING POWERS.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.200
- LOOK, ROSALYN,
THERE'S BEEN A CRAZY MIX-UP--

08:27.233 --> 08:29.867
- DON'T CALL ME ROSALYN,
YOU PINT-SIZED HOOLIGAN!

08:31.600 --> 08:34.567
- I'M NOT LOUIE.
IT'S ME, RAY.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.200
- NICE TRY.

08:36.233 --> 08:38.167
I JUST SAW YOUR FATHER
IN THE HALLWAY,

08:38.200 --> 08:41.700
AND HE TOLD ME YOU'D SAY
YOU'D SWITCHED FORMS.

08:41.733 --> 08:43.533
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

08:45.733 --> 08:48.533
LOOK, LADY--WHOA!
THAT'S A LOTTA WARTS!

08:51.667 --> 08:54.367
- MOM, THINK THIS THROUGH.
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.533
IT'S CALLED THE WILD-ER-NESS,

08:56.567 --> 08:59.767
NOT THE SAFETY-DER-NESS.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.867
YEAH.
LET THAT SINK IN.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.067
- HONEY, RAY'S A CAMPING
EXPERT.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.900
WE ARE ABSOLUTELY
IN SAFE HANDS.

09:06.933 --> 09:09.500
- * I'M GOING CAMPIN'!
HEY!

09:09.533 --> 09:11.733
* I'M HITTIN' THE WOODS,
'CAUSE I GOT THE GOODS *

09:11.767 --> 09:14.633
* I'M LOU--

09:14.667 --> 09:16.200
HEY, FAMILY.

09:16.233 --> 09:18.633
UH, LET US DEPART NOW.

09:18.667 --> 09:22.133
- I CALL FRONT SEAT.
- OH, NOT FAIR!

09:22.167 --> 09:24.967
HE ALWAYS GETS FRONT SEAT!
ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS!

09:27.200 --> 09:29.200
- WHOA, DAD.

09:29.233 --> 09:31.100
YOU CAN HAVE IT.
YOU'RE THE GROWNUP.

09:31.133 --> 09:33.533
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

09:34.733 --> 09:38.467
I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.133
I'M IN CHARGE!

09:41.167 --> 09:42.867
YOU GOT A SPOT
ON YOUR KERCHIEF.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.467
- OH, NO!
- MADE YA LOOK.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.667
PFFT!

09:45.700 --> 09:47.733
LET'S GO CAMPING!

09:58.733 --> 10:01.033
- HA!
YEAH!

10:01.067 --> 10:04.033
THIS SPOT'S COOL.
LET'S CAMP HERE AND STUFF!

10:07.033 --> 10:08.633
- WOW, RAY, WHEN YOU SAID,
"LAST ONE OUT

10:08.667 --> 10:11.400
IS A SMELLY DOO-DOO HEAD WHO
HAS TO CARRY EVERYTHING,"

10:11.433 --> 10:13.733
I THOUGHT YOU WERE KIDDING.

10:22.433 --> 10:24.033
- DAD, GHOST SCOUT RULE
NUMBER 42

10:24.067 --> 10:25.633
SAYS TO FIRST SECURE
ALL THE FOOD

10:25.667 --> 10:27.433
SO STRAY ANIMALS
DON'T WANDER INTO CAMP.

10:27.467 --> 10:29.333
- MEH MEH MEH MEH MEH
MEH-MEH-MEH.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.200
I'M MILES.
I MEMORIZE STUFF.

10:31.233 --> 10:34.367
SET UP MY HAMMOCK!

10:36.067 --> 10:38.967
I COULD LOSE
MY KERCHIEF FOR THIS.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.600
- SPEAKING OF COMFORT...

10:42.600 --> 10:44.067
HA HA!

10:44.100 --> 10:46.700
- I'M NOT SURE
I LIKE CAMPING RAY.

10:49.533 --> 10:51.167
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
MRS. GUNDERSON

10:51.200 --> 10:54.533
PUT THESE MITTENS ON ME
AND TOOK AWAY MY POWERS.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.267
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE WEARING

10:56.300 --> 10:59.267
THAT STUPID MATCHING OUTFIT
YOUR DAD BOUGHT YOU.

10:59.300 --> 11:02.167
- HEY, THE SASS
STOPS NOW, YOUNG LADY.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.600
- OH, GIVE IT UP.

11:03.633 --> 11:06.567
NO ONE'S BUYING
THE "I'M RAY" ACT.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.567
- FIRST OF ALL,
THIS ISN'T AN ACT.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.567
AND SECONDLY--I'M RAY!

11:12.600 --> 11:13.667
- OKAY.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.633
IF YOU'RE REALLY RAY,

11:15.667 --> 11:18.500
THEN YOU'LL HAVE NO PROBLEM
SPELLING THE WORD PHANTOM.

11:18.533 --> 11:20.467
- FINE. P--

11:20.500 --> 11:23.267
RAY! IT IS YOU!

11:23.300 --> 11:26.500
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
- I KNOW.

11:26.533 --> 11:29.700
WE WERE POSSESSING THE SAME
OBJECT, AND THIS HAPPENED.

11:29.733 --> 11:32.333
- I'M TALKING ABOUT LOUIE
OUT THERE TOASTING MARSHMALLOWS

11:32.367 --> 11:36.333
AND LEAVING ME HERE TO ROT
WITH NO-FUN GUNDERSON AND YOU!

11:36.367 --> 11:40.300
I MEAN...AND YOU!

11:40.333 --> 11:42.600
WE'VE GOT TO FIX THIS.

11:42.633 --> 11:44.067
- THE GHOST BOOK!

11:44.100 --> 11:46.200
THAT HAS THE ANSWER
TO EVERYTHING.

11:48.733 --> 11:51.633
RAY PRESTON,
YOU ONE SMART COOKIE.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.133
HA-HA-HA!

11:55.633 --> 11:57.333
READING?

11:57.367 --> 12:00.600
DID I SAY IT WAS PLAYTIME?

12:00.633 --> 12:02.300
BACK TO CLEANING!

12:05.700 --> 12:08.400
- I CAN'T BELIEVE RAY
HIRED THAT BATTLE AX.

12:08.433 --> 12:10.333
HE'S SUCH A DOOF!

12:10.367 --> 12:14.067
- STILL IN HERE, FRANKIE.

12:14.100 --> 12:17.467
- WHOO, POW!

12:17.500 --> 12:19.233
POW!

12:19.267 --> 12:22.267
EXPLODING LUNCH MEAT?
BEST DAY EVER!

12:26.100 --> 12:28.300
- LAUNCHING BOLOGNA
ALL OVER A CAMPSITE?

12:28.333 --> 12:32.167
JIMINY CRICKETS,
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE!

12:32.200 --> 12:33.933
COME ON, DORK-A-TRON.

12:33.967 --> 12:35.333
IT'S FUN.

12:35.367 --> 12:38.933
- DID YOU JUST CALL ME
"DORK

12:38.967 --> 12:40.333
- UH...

12:40.367 --> 12:44.233
IT'S FRENCH, UH,
FOR "BELOVED SON".

12:44.267 --> 12:48.967
- OH. MERCI.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.233
- YES!

12:50.267 --> 12:51.467
I DID IT!

12:51.500 --> 12:53.467
I ASSEMBLED THE TENT!

12:53.500 --> 12:57.633
I BATTLED NATURE,
AND I WON!

12:57.667 --> 13:00.233
HOW DO I GET OUT?

13:00.267 --> 13:02.067
THE FLAP WON'T OPEN!

13:02.100 --> 13:05.100
I'M TRAPPED!

13:07.133 --> 13:11.700
NEVER MIND.
I'M OUT.

13:11.733 --> 13:14.733
REALLY?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.700
- OOH.
HEY.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.967
- NOT NOW, FRANKIE.

13:24.067 --> 13:25.533
- IT'S MILES.

13:25.567 --> 13:27.933
YOU KNOW THERE'S NO PHONE
IN YOUR HANDS, RIGHT?

13:27.967 --> 13:29.333
- YES.

13:29.367 --> 13:30.633
SORTA.

13:30.667 --> 13:33.400
I DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYMORE.

13:33.433 --> 13:36.167
IT'S JUST, I MISS MY FRIENDS
AND ALL THE GOSSIP.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.333
- TAYLOR, YOU'RE SITTING
RIGHT NEXT TO A FRIEND

13:38.367 --> 13:40.433
WITH PLENTY OF GOSSIP
UP HIS SLEEVE.

13:40.467 --> 13:41.967
HA.

13:42.067 --> 13:43.467
YOU GOT STUFF TO DISH?

13:43.500 --> 13:45.367
- SURE.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.400
WELL, LET'S SEE.

13:47.433 --> 13:49.533
YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT ME
GETTING MY SCOUT'S KERCHIEF.

13:49.567 --> 13:52.567
THAT GOT PRETTY POLITICAL.

13:56.733 --> 13:58.533
UH-OH.

13:58.567 --> 14:00.100
WHAT?

14:00.133 --> 14:02.067
NO WAY.

14:03.367 --> 14:04.700
- THAT GROUP OF SQUIRRELS
DOWN THERE

14:04.733 --> 14:06.767
IS INVOLVED
IN A MAJOR LOVE TRIANGLE.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.633
- YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
SQUIRRELS?

14:08.667 --> 14:10.567
- SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.067
LOGAN'S A BAD-BOY SQUIRREL

14:12.067 --> 14:13.433
FROM THE WRONG SIDE
OF THE POND.

14:13.467 --> 14:15.533
HE WAS CAUGHT SWAPPING ACORNS
WITH AVA.

14:15.567 --> 14:19.067
OOOH!

14:19.067 --> 14:21.067
RUSTY, HER FIANCE,
WAS SUPPOSED TO MARRY HER,

14:21.067 --> 14:23.400
BUT THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.

14:23.433 --> 14:24.667
- MILES, DO YOU REALLY THINK

14:24.700 --> 14:26.333
THAT I'M SO STARVED
FOR GOSSIP

14:26.367 --> 14:28.633
THAT I REALLY CARE
WHAT SOME SQUIRREL IS SAYING?

14:28.667 --> 14:31.300
PFFT.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.267
SO DOES AVA LOVE LOGAN?

14:33.300 --> 14:35.200
SHE'S CONFUSED.

14:35.233 --> 14:37.233
RUSTY GIVES HER STABILITY,
BUT WITH LOGAN,

14:37.267 --> 14:40.067
IT'S ONE DAY AT A TIME.

14:40.067 --> 14:42.267
UH-OH.
THIS IS BAD!

14:42.300 --> 14:44.700
IS THE ENGAGEMENT OFF?

14:44.733 --> 14:47.733
- NO! THERE'S A HUGE BEAR
IN OUR CAMPSITE!

14:57.500 --> 14:59.500
I'M GETTING REAL T--

15:01.367 --> 15:02.600
BEAR!

15:02.633 --> 15:04.367
RAY, DO SOMETHING!

15:04.400 --> 15:09.133
- UH, RIGHT!
I'M ON IT!

15:09.167 --> 15:12.300
- I MEANT DO SOMETHING
FOR ME!

15:12.333 --> 15:14.333
- OH, I KNEW THAT.

15:14.367 --> 15:17.933
TAKE THIS, BEAR!

15:17.967 --> 15:22.267
- S-SO I'LL BE MAULED
BY A FUNNY BEAR?

15:28.300 --> 15:30.367
THANK YOU, MILES.
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.567
- I WEAR THE KERCHIEF.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.300
IT'S WHAT WE DO.

15:37.233 --> 15:40.267
- ALL RIGHT, TIME TO GET
THAT BOOK BACK.

15:40.300 --> 15:41.667
- WAIT HERE.

15:41.700 --> 15:44.500
I'LL GO GET MY CROSSBOW
AND LAUGHING GAS.

15:44.533 --> 15:46.933
- NO, THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU KIDS.

15:46.967 --> 15:49.267
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO HATCH
SOME CRAZY PLAN,

15:49.300 --> 15:52.467
WHEN ALL IT TAKES IS
A LITTLE MATURITY AND CHARM.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.967
WATCH AND LEARN, LITTLE ONE.
HA!

15:57.967 --> 15:59.633
GOOD EVENING, MRS. GUNDERSON.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.233
- IT WAS.

16:02.267 --> 16:04.100
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:04.133 --> 16:06.267
- ROSALYN, I THINK YOU AND I
GOT OFF

16:06.300 --> 16:09.267
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

16:09.300 --> 16:13.367
WOW, GOT A LITTLE DISTRACTED
BY YOUR SPARKLING EYES.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.500
WHAT COLOR
WOULD YOU CALL THAT?

16:15.533 --> 16:19.467
- COAL.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.067
- ANYWAY, I THOUGHT
IF WE TOOK A MOMENT TO HAVE

16:22.100 --> 16:23.700
A MATURE CONVERSATION,

16:23.733 --> 16:25.967
WE CAN REACH
AN UNDERSTANDING.

16:28.567 --> 16:30.667
YOU ARE SO NOT GETTING
A CHRISTMAS CARD

16:30.700 --> 16:35.267
FROM THE PRESTONS
THIS YEAR, MADAM!

16:35.300 --> 16:38.133
- I'M SURE I'LL MISS
THE WACKY PHOTO OF YOU ALL

16:38.167 --> 16:41.633
IN A FAKE SNOWBALL FIGHT!

16:41.667 --> 16:45.500
THAT'S YOUR CARD?

16:45.533 --> 16:48.067
YOU CAN TAKE ME
OFF THAT LIST TOO.

16:48.067 --> 16:50.067
- THAT WOMAN WOULDN'T EVEN
LISTEN TO ME.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.500
- WELCOME TO KID WORLD.

16:51.533 --> 16:54.333
NOT ALWAYS FUN TO NEVER BE
TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

16:54.367 --> 16:56.567
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS, FRANKIE,

16:56.600 --> 16:58.933
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

16:58.967 --> 17:00.533
- DEPENDS.

17:00.567 --> 17:03.567
YOU WILLING TO GET
YOUR HANDS DIRTY?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.100
- OKAY, RAY.

17:07.133 --> 17:08.467
WE'RE IN A TREE.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.367
ANYTIME NOW,
LOVE TO HEAR YOUR PLAN.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.067
I GOT NOTHING.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.967
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING?

17:20.067 --> 17:21.933
I'M LOUIE.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.200
- WE ACCIDENTALLY
SWITCHED FORMS.

17:25.233 --> 17:27.267
I TOOK OVER BEFORE MY DAD
COULD STOP ME.

17:29.067 --> 17:32.200
- THE RAINBOW WIG
MAKES SENSE NOW.

17:32.233 --> 17:35.233
- AT FIRST, IT WAS FUN,
BUT NOW IT STINKS.

17:35.267 --> 17:37.200
BEING AN ADULT
IS A LOT OF WORK.

17:37.233 --> 17:38.633
SOMEONE ELSE LEAD.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.300
- LET ME SEE
IF I'VE GOT THIS STRAIGHT.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.200
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE,
IN A TREE,

17:42.233 --> 17:43.600
WITH A WILD BEAR
BENEATH US,

17:43.633 --> 17:46.233
AND I AM THE ONLY ADULT?

17:46.267 --> 17:48.533
- YUH-HUH.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.067
- OH, I KNOW.

17:50.067 --> 17:52.500
I CAN JUST CALL FOR HELP
ON MY CELL PHONE.

17:52.533 --> 17:55.600
OHHH.

17:55.633 --> 17:57.567
- OKAY, MILES,
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN HELP

17:57.600 --> 17:59.067
GET RID OF THE BEAR?

17:59.100 --> 18:01.567
- OH, YEAH, TALK TO HIM.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.433
YOU CAN COMMUNICATE
WITH ANIMALS.

18:03.467 --> 18:04.733
- OH, GROW UP, TAYLOR.

18:04.767 --> 18:06.300
I CAN'T TALK TO ANIMALS.

18:06.333 --> 18:09.467
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.133
- SO THERE WAS NEVER
A RUSTY?

18:11.167 --> 18:14.100
- LET IT GO, WOMAN.

18:14.133 --> 18:15.400
AND, LOUIE...

18:15.433 --> 18:17.100
- THERE'S SOMETHING
ON YOUR SHIRT.

18:18.333 --> 18:19.500
UH--PFFT!

18:19.533 --> 18:22.067
- THERE'S A BEAR HERE,
PEOPLE!

18:22.067 --> 18:23.667
- FINE.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.200
I CAUSED THIS.

18:25.233 --> 18:27.300
I'M GONNA SAVE
THIS FAMILY.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.367
YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET RID
OF A BEAR?

18:29.400 --> 18:32.400
WITH A BIGGER, MEANER BEAR!

18:34.567 --> 18:38.567
CHECK ME OUT!
HA!

18:38.600 --> 18:40.500
HUH? UH-OH.

18:40.533 --> 18:44.167
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.633
- HE LIKES YOU!

18:45.667 --> 18:47.600
THINK YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO
ON YOUR FIRST DATE.

18:47.633 --> 18:51.433
- OH, YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!

18:51.467 --> 18:53.700
- THANKS, LOUIE!

18:53.733 --> 18:55.967
GREAT WORK!

18:56.067 --> 18:57.500
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

18:57.533 --> 18:58.700
- THE BEAR CAN'T HURT HIM.
HE'S A GHOST.

18:58.733 --> 19:00.167
HE'LL REMEMBER THAT.

19:05.067 --> 19:08.533
- EVENTUALLY.

19:08.567 --> 19:10.067
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.333
- YOU CAN,
BUT IF YOU'RE CAPTURED,

19:12.367 --> 19:14.133
NO NAMES.

19:14.167 --> 19:17.167
SEE YA ON THE OTHER SIDE.

19:31.667 --> 19:34.200
- MRS. G,
THE VACUUM'S BROKEN.

19:34.233 --> 19:37.100
I REALLY WANT THINGS
TO LOOK NICE FOR MY DAD.

19:37.133 --> 19:39.500
HE'S A CARING, THOUGHTFUL GUY.

19:39.533 --> 19:41.700
- I ALWAYS FOUND HIM
FULL OF HIMSELF.

19:41.733 --> 19:44.733
LET ME SEE THAT THING.

19:48.333 --> 19:49.567
OOH, OH, WHOA!

19:49.600 --> 19:51.633
WHOA, OH, OH!

19:51.667 --> 19:53.267
AAH, TURN IT OFF!
AAH!

19:53.300 --> 19:55.233
TURN IT OFF NOW!
OH!

19:55.267 --> 19:57.367
- DARN THING WON'T SHUT OFF.

19:57.400 --> 20:01.400
- OH, TURN IT OFF!

20:03.400 --> 20:06.300
- AH!
SQUEAKY CLEAN, MRS. G.

20:06.333 --> 20:09.700
LOOKS LIKES SOMEONE CAN SKIP
HER BATH TONIGHT.

20:09.733 --> 20:11.600
- BATHING IS FOR THE WEAK.

20:11.633 --> 20:15.200
OUT.

20:15.233 --> 20:17.600
OUT!

20:17.633 --> 20:20.033
- WE DID IT!
NICE.

20:20.067 --> 20:22.600
I HAVEN'T HAD THAT MUCH FUN
IN A LONG TIME.

20:22.633 --> 20:25.433
SO WHAT DO YOU AND LOUIE
USUALLY DO TO CELEBRATE?

20:25.467 --> 20:30.233
- ONE TIME, WE POURED OATMEAL
IN RAY'S SAXOPHONE.

20:30.267 --> 20:32.500
O...KAY.

20:32.533 --> 20:35.533
WE REALLY GOTTA
SWITCH YOU BACK.

20:39.433 --> 20:41.367
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT ALMOST
BEING EATEN BY A BEAR

20:41.400 --> 20:44.267
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL CLOSER
TO THOSE AROUND YOU.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.467
DID I LEAVE MILES AND TAYLOR

20:45.500 --> 20:48.600
IN THE CAR?

20:52.967 --> 20:54.533
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

20:54.567 --> 20:58.367
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY
FOR YOURSELF, YOUNG MAN?

20:58.400 --> 21:01.500
- DAD, I'M SO SORRY.
- YOU SHOULD BE.

21:01.533 --> 21:03.467
- I THOUGHT BEING AN ADULT
WOULD BE AWESOME,

21:03.500 --> 21:04.700
BUT I'M NOT READY
FOR THAT.

21:04.733 --> 21:08.067
IT'S REALLY HARD.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.167
- YEAH, IT IS.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.333
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
SO IS BEING A KID.

21:13.367 --> 21:18.100
SOMETIMES GROWNUPS NEED
TO LISTEN MORE.

21:18.133 --> 21:21.067
SO YOU READY
TO SWITCH BACK?

21:21.067 --> 21:23.300
- YES, SIR.

21:23.333 --> 21:25.067
- THE GHOST BOOK SAYS
WE HAVE TO DO

21:25.067 --> 21:27.467
EXACTLY WHAT WE DID BEFORE
TO GET BACK TO NORMAL.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.600
SO LET'S DO THIS!
HA!

21:33.367 --> 21:35.300
WHOO-HOO!
HA, HA!

21:35.333 --> 21:36.600
WHOO!

21:36.633 --> 21:38.467
- WHOO-HOO!

21:38.500 --> 21:39.700
- EVERYBODY'S OKAY.

21:39.733 --> 21:42.633
OOF!

21:48.367 --> 21:50.067
YOU'RE ON MY LIST, TWERP.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.667
YOU'RE OUT THERE
HAVING A BLAST,

21:51.700 --> 21:53.567
AND YOU LEAVE ME HERE
WITH GUNDERSON AND RAY?

21:53.600 --> 21:55.667
FYI, I HAD TO WORK
REALLY HARD

21:55.700 --> 21:58.600
TO MAKE YOUR DAD FUN.

21:59.900 --> 22:04.733
WE SWITCHED BACK, FRANKIE.
I'M RAY.
