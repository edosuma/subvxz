WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:08.425
[coyote howling]

00:10.760 --> 00:12.554
Well, say something! What's happening?

00:12.637 --> 00:14.848
Oh, my God!

00:15.390 --> 00:16.725
He's still alive.

00:16.808 --> 00:20.270
Okay, confirm a theory I'm working on.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.814
Am I a severed head?

00:22.981 --> 00:25.150
When you bit him, he must have turned.

00:25.608 --> 00:28.111
-And we didn't kill his brain.
-We didn't know.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.529
Okay. So, that's a yes?

00:29.904 --> 00:30.739
Fuck.

00:31.781 --> 00:35.076
All this time, you've just been
lying awake here in this hole?

00:35.160 --> 00:37.245
In a pudding of my own guts.

00:37.328 --> 00:40.874
Oh, God, that must have been awful.
Although, you did attack me.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.917
But look what you did to me!

00:43.543 --> 00:44.669
God, I miss gesturing.

00:45.628 --> 00:46.921
So, what happens now?

00:47.005 --> 00:50.049
You can't live like this, so...

00:50.842 --> 00:53.094
I guess we have to kill you...?

00:53.178 --> 00:54.220
Are you asking me?

00:54.304 --> 00:56.681
No, I was trailing off
because it's uncomfortable.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.477
None of this is ideal, Gary.
And, clearly, mistakes were made.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.689
But we would like to send you off
with as much dignity as possible.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.316
[Joel] Would you like to hear some music?

01:06.399 --> 01:09.194
We've got satellite radio,
so we've got everything.

01:09.277 --> 01:13.323
Sometimes too much.
Do we really need 400 channels in our car?

01:13.406 --> 01:14.949
-I know, right?
-Okay.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.243
Before you kill me,
I do have one last request.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.121
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's not the way satellite works.

01:20.205 --> 01:23.500
-You just get the channels.
-It's ridiculous, the amount you pay.

01:23.583 --> 01:27.086
No, I-- I mean there's something
I want you to do for me before I die.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.798
Something... incredibly important.

01:29.881 --> 01:34.260
-Really? You want us to do you a favor?
-You buried me alive.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.012
Not knowingly.

01:36.095 --> 01:38.139
[motorcycles revving]

01:39.557 --> 01:41.935
Dirt bikers. We should get out of here.

01:42.018 --> 01:44.604
Okay. We'll find somewhere
to bury the rest of him,

01:44.687 --> 01:46.481
and then take him home and hear him out.

01:46.564 --> 01:49.567
-I don't wanna take him home.
-Do you have a better idea?

01:51.236 --> 01:52.362
God damn it.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.247
There.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.958
-Good as new.
-Hey, can I be in the living room?

02:05.041 --> 02:06.251
It's kind of spooky down here.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.920
The only reason it's spooky down here
is because you're down here.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.923
We could put you in a garden of lollipops
and it would still be spooky.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.801
So Gary, what is your request?

02:14.884 --> 02:18.888
Well, I had a lot of time to reflect
on my life while I was buried out there.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.684
I wasn't a good person.
Hurt a lot of people,

02:22.767 --> 02:24.686
-only thought about myself.
-Blah, blah, blah.

02:24.769 --> 02:27.021
What do you need from us, Head?

02:27.105 --> 02:29.274
There was only one thing I ever did
I was proud of.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.860
I always took care of my niece, Kayla.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.655
She's had a lot of bad breaks,
but I was the one person in her life

02:35.738 --> 02:38.324
who always made sure she and her baby
had food to eat,

02:38.408 --> 02:39.993
a roof over their heads.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.203
That's really nice.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.664
He assaulted you. He's a creep.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.792
People can be more than one thing, Joel.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.713
Look, in my office, there's a deed
to a summer house I own on Lake Michigan.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.716
I want you to give it to Kayla
so she and her little girl can...

02:54.799 --> 02:58.052
get out of their crappy apartment
in Long Beach, start a new life.

02:58.636 --> 03:02.307
You do that for me,
then I'll be ready to die.

03:02.974 --> 03:07.645
I think being separated from your penis
has made you a better man.

03:08.229 --> 03:11.816
Maybe.
It certainly has given me more free time.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.485
Please, I'm the only family Kayla has.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.863
I can't bear her thinking
that I've abandoned her.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.948
-No, fucking...
-Joel?

03:25.622 --> 03:27.707
[sighs] I think we should do this.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.545
God damn it. But then, this is it.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.882
We deliver the deed to his niece,
and then lights out.

03:35.965 --> 03:39.886
Absolutely. See?
You were wondering if we were bad people.

03:39.969 --> 03:43.598
But only good people would do a favor
for the severed head of their victim.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.850
I think at best,
we're in a moral gray area.

03:50.396 --> 03:53.483
I fed Gary.
I gave him pieces of the Serbian guy,

03:53.566 --> 03:57.487
most of which fell through his neck
into the vase, but he seemed to enjoy it.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.573
Hey, what would you think if,
for the bookshelves in here,

04:00.657 --> 04:03.534
I built them out of cherry wood,
like this?

04:03.618 --> 04:05.745
Oh. Yeah, this is nice.

04:05.828 --> 04:09.582
And what would you think if,
instead of driving 50 miles to Long Beach,

04:09.666 --> 04:14.337
we mailed that deed to Gary's niece
in an envelope, like this?

04:14.671 --> 04:16.631
We'd still be good people.
Maybe even better

04:16.714 --> 04:18.800
because our carbon footprint
would be smaller.

04:19.217 --> 04:20.885
I know, but it's Gary's last wish.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.930
And Kayla deserves to know
why she's never gonna see her uncle again.

04:24.013 --> 04:27.392
And we owe it to her
to deliver that lie in person.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.476
I know.

04:29.018 --> 04:31.187
[sighs] I just wanted to have
one normal day.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.857
I know, things have been crazy
these last few weeks,

04:34.941 --> 04:36.693
but I just feel so guilty.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.695
Gary loved his niece,
and now thanks to me,

04:38.778 --> 04:41.531
that poor girl's gonna be all alone
in the world.

04:41.906 --> 04:45.118
I get it. I just had a different vision
of what today would look like.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.370
Well, what did you want to do, sweetheart?

04:47.453 --> 04:49.831
Well... I need a haircut.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.751
This is insane. And I wanted to buy wood
for the bookshelves.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.462
And there's this new Chinese place
on Riverside I'd like to try.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.756
We haven't had a date night since
this all started.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.550
You know, normal stuff.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.053
We can go see Gary's niece
and still do all of that.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.390
I would love nothing more
than to have a date night with you.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.183
Great. I also haven't written

05:09.267 --> 05:11.102
a restaurant review for Yelp
in a long time,

05:11.185 --> 05:12.645
and my followers rely on me.

05:12.729 --> 05:16.190
Elite status is a privilege and a burden.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.443
Yeah, I was kind of hoping that Yelp thing
would die with me.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.653
But I know it's important to you,
so I pretend I care.

05:20.820 --> 05:21.654
Thank you.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.865
[Abby] Where's my phone charger?

05:24.574 --> 05:26.743
Mom,
did you take it with you to the basement?

05:27.827 --> 05:30.538
Shit. We can't let her find Gary's head.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.874
I know. I'm not worried about her
being shocked.

05:32.957 --> 05:36.002
-I'm just tired of her criticizing us.
-Uh, I have one.

05:36.085 --> 05:39.756
-I'll bring it down to you. Just hang on.
-We have to keep her out of there today.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.799
Oh, God, but if we tell her,
"Don't go into the basement,"

05:41.883 --> 05:44.010
-the second we leave...
-She'll go to the basement.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.386
So, what do we do?

05:51.267 --> 05:52.935
I want you to clean the basement today.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.438
Sure, I'll get right on that.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.192
Is this you guys?

05:59.275 --> 06:01.444
"Human body parts
found near Rocky Peak Park."

06:01.778 --> 06:02.779
No.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.198
But it sure sounds like us.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.825
God, this guy was really ripped to pieces.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.536
Think there's someone
out there like you?

06:10.620 --> 06:12.830
Let's not make everyone's problems
our problems.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.666
People get ripped to pieces all the time.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.336
-No, they don't.
-They do for the purpose of my argument.

06:18.419 --> 06:21.130
We have a lot on our plate,
let's not go looking for more.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.425
It really makes you wonder, though.
Who could've killed this poor guy?

06:25.093 --> 06:27.303
Thank you for taking me to lunch.
It was fun.

06:27.386 --> 06:29.514
Thank you for inviting me
back to your apartment,

06:29.597 --> 06:32.850
where you live by yourself
with the bed and everything.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.063
You know, I still feel bad
you didn't eat anything.

06:37.146 --> 06:39.524
Was Panda Express a bad choice
for a first date?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.651
-Yes.
-Cool.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.444
But also, I just wasn't hungry.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.493
[Ramona exhales]

06:50.576 --> 06:52.286
[jaw cracking]

06:55.373 --> 06:57.917
There are a million things
I wanna do to you.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.129
There's a million things
I've had done to me.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.299
But I did all of them myself.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.094
Actually, it's just one thing
a million times.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.303
Can I have some water?

07:13.391 --> 07:14.809
I'll get you that water.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.312
Jesus Christ, it's happening.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.611
Okay.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.989
Oh. Stay calm, Eric.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.908
Dumber people than you
do this successfully all the time.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.579
Wake up, old friend,
your days of leisure are over.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.247
[squelching]

07:40.084 --> 07:41.127
Fuck me.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.714
[phone ringing]

07:46.883 --> 07:47.758
Hey, Romeo.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.013
I don't have time for gentle ribbing.
I'm in Ramona's bathroom.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.056
She's undead.
I think she brought me here to kill me.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.684
-Oh, my God. Run!
-I can't, she's right outside.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.269
Okay, uh, lock the bathroom door.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.604
What's her address? I'll be right there.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.648
34 Sunbird, apartment 2D. Hurry!

08:02.732 --> 08:04.650
And don't take McBean.
It's a parking lot at this hour.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.360
If I were you, I'd get
on Magic Mountain Parkway

08:06.444 --> 08:08.571
-and go all the way to Rose--
-Eric, I'll find it!

08:09.906 --> 08:10.740
Oh, God.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.035
[suspenseful music playing]

08:14.911 --> 08:16.412
I should've brought more protection.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.413
[Ramona screams]

08:21.083 --> 08:24.253
I'm sorry that we're not gonna make it
back in time for your hair appointment.

08:24.337 --> 08:28.007
It's all right. It's not your fault.
There was traffic on the 405.

08:28.090 --> 08:31.677
I just don't understand why people
slow down to look at a mattress.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.722
Well, it was brand-new
and it had a cowboy boot next to it.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.807
It invites questions.

08:36.891 --> 08:37.725
[elevator dings]

08:39.810 --> 08:41.729
If we hurry, we can still
make the lumberyard

08:41.812 --> 08:43.439
and get Chinese food on the way back.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.443
Unless the other cowboy boot
shows up and fucks us.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.862
-Hi!
-Hi!

08:49.946 --> 08:51.531
-Kayla Lawson?
-Yes?

08:51.614 --> 08:54.033
We're John and Wendy Darling.
We called earlier.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.786
Yeah, you have some news
about my Uncle Gary? Is he okay?

08:56.869 --> 08:57.703
You know Gary.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.581
No matter how bad things get,
he always comes out <i>ahead.</i>

09:00.665 --> 09:02.291
-We're doing that now?
-No, I'm done.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.209
Okay.

09:06.128 --> 09:09.549
Really? So Uncle Gary
just dropped everything and left?

09:09.632 --> 09:12.677
He said he loves you very much,
but he needed to change his life.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.346
So he gave up
all of his material possessions,

09:15.429 --> 09:18.599
and moved to a remote village
to help the poor.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.395
-I wonder why he didn't call.
-Great question.

09:22.478 --> 09:26.190
Because he gave up all of his possessions,
so obviously he doesn't have his phone.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.108
Great answer.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.653
-Did he say where he was going?
-I'll take this one.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.321
I think it was Guatemal--

09:32.405 --> 09:36.242
No, he kept it vague
because he didn't want anyone to find him.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.326
Yeah, that's better.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.495
For everyone.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.039
Holy shit. [chuckles]
Well, good for Uncle Gary.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.626
See, I always thought that he would just
grope the wrong woman one day

09:45.710 --> 09:46.544
and she'd kill him.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.297
[both laughing]

09:49.380 --> 09:52.550
-Nothing could be further from the truth.
-Nothing.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.553
Anyway, he wanted to make sure
you were taken care of.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.389
So he asked us to give you this.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.893
It's a deed to a house in Michigan.
Six acres on a lake.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.146
All paid for and all yours.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.647
[laughs] Oh, my God.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.108
I spent the summers here
when I was little.

10:09.191 --> 10:13.279
See, my parents are divorced, so these are
some of the happiest memories that I have.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.866
Thank you. Thank you so much.

10:17.950 --> 10:21.203
And thank you for driving all the way
down here just to give this to me.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.582
You are such good people.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.752
Thank you, Kayla. We're trying to be.

10:27.835 --> 10:31.088
Sometimes we do things we're not proud of,
and to balance the moral scales...

10:31.172 --> 10:33.341
-You're welcome.
-You're right, that's better.

10:34.008 --> 10:37.136
Fuck! Fuck you, Uncle Gary!

10:37.595 --> 10:40.097
And fuck you, nice people.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.642
You've given me this gift
and now I can't even use it.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.185
Kayla, what is it?

10:44.268 --> 10:46.228
It's this guy, Boone. [sniffles]

10:46.312 --> 10:48.230
I was dating him for a couple weeks,

10:48.314 --> 10:49.774
and he's pissed because
I broke up with him.

10:49.857 --> 10:52.610
And he has my car.
He won't give it back.

10:52.693 --> 10:56.739
I can't live on a lake
in the middle of nowhere without a car!

10:56.822 --> 10:57.948
[baby crying]

10:58.032 --> 10:59.575
Now I woke the baby.

11:00.534 --> 11:03.245
[Kayla sobbing]

11:04.955 --> 11:07.917
Does it feel like we've done enough?
I think we may have done enough.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.629
Joel, it was Gary's last wish
that we get her to Michigan.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.507
And we haven't done that yet.
We have to go and get her car back.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.885
I know. It just
the cherry wood I wanted is on sale,

11:17.968 --> 11:21.889
and it's a very fast moving wood.
I guess we could just get pine.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.225
The Toyota Camry of the forest.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.811
We are doing a good thing, honey.

11:26.894 --> 11:30.481
And you are gonna get your Chinese food,
I promise.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.191
[sniffling]

11:33.943 --> 11:37.571
Listen, Kayla, if you give us
the address to your ex-boyfriend,

11:37.655 --> 11:39.532
we will go there and get your car back.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.325
Oh, my God. Really?

11:42.159 --> 11:43.661
Thank you so much.

11:48.666 --> 11:49.917
Here's his address.

11:50.751 --> 11:54.422
[sighs] You guys, I really appreciate it.
Really.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.133
-[Joel] Of course.
-It's our pleasure.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.343
You know, I should probably warn you
about my ex.

12:00.010 --> 12:00.845
Warn us?

12:00.928 --> 12:02.096
Uh...

12:02.179 --> 12:03.556
You'll probably be okay.

12:05.057 --> 12:05.891
Thank you.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.730
-Well, that felt good, didn't it?
-Yeah.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.358
Except for the ominous part at the end.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.110
Oh, you noticed that, too?

12:19.989 --> 12:20.823
Wow.

12:22.241 --> 12:26.120
That was... awesome. [chuckles]

12:26.203 --> 12:27.538
Your nose is bleeding.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.207
That happens sometimes when I get excited.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.089
My cat did that once.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.341
Your tongue is way softer.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.219
Eat this, bitch!

12:44.054 --> 12:44.889
Oh.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.850
Oh, she didn't attack you. You had sex.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.477
Thrice.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.770
Didn't occur to you to text me an update?

12:51.854 --> 12:54.023
Mmm, no, it really didn't.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.610
Hey, befor you judge me,
you took almost 40 minutes to get here

12:57.693 --> 12:59.361
when you thought I was gonna die.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.363
Look, putting on my mom's kill-suit
was a whole big thing,

13:01.447 --> 13:03.365
and then traffic was a nightmare.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.075
You took McBean, didn't you?

13:05.993 --> 13:06.827
Yeah, yes.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.662
That's a good look on you.

13:09.038 --> 13:09.872
Thank you.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.084
-Are you really undead?
-Uh-huh.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.337
Did my mom bite you?

13:16.921 --> 13:17.796
No.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.840
-Then how did it happen?
-I don't know.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.718
I woke up one morning,
vomited, died,

13:22.801 --> 13:26.430
then went on a hike, a jogger
yelled at me to get out of his way,

13:26.514 --> 13:29.308
and I smashed his head in with a rock
and ate his brain.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.393
Why do joggers think they own the road?

13:31.477 --> 13:32.770
It makes me so mad.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.146
You're so supportive.

13:38.067 --> 13:38.943
[clicks tongue]

13:39.026 --> 13:41.362
-Okay, you guys are-- are good.
-[Ramona] Wait.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.658
We met at the Rite Aid.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.576
You said your mom was sick.
How is she?

13:48.827 --> 13:50.120
She's doing better. Why?

13:50.204 --> 13:53.374
I wanted to see if she's having
the same problem as I am.

13:54.917 --> 13:55.751
[tearing]

13:55.835 --> 13:57.253
-Oh, my God.
-[Abby] Jesus.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.171
It came off a week ago.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.548
I Velcroed it back on.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.971
Don't worry, babe. I can help you.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.436
Maybe he's not so bad. He has a bird bath.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.565
He's inviting birds to come
and play on his front lawn.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.234
We have a hummingbird feeder
and we kill people.

14:20.317 --> 14:24.029
I'm just saying, you can't always judge
a person by their aviary accessories.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.114
[doorbell rings]

14:25.781 --> 14:26.615
Yeah?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.076
-Boone Tarver?
-Yeah.

14:29.159 --> 14:32.371
I'm Hume Cronyn
and this is my wife, Jessica Tandy.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.165
[Sheila] We're friends of Kayla,

14:35.249 --> 14:38.252
and we'd really like it if you'd consider
giving her her car back.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.880
It would be the right thing to do,
and as a bird bath owner,

14:40.963 --> 14:42.840
I know you're always looking for ways
to help others.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.134
Fuck that shit. Even if Kayla
was a beautiful bird,

14:45.217 --> 14:46.802
I wouldn't give that bitch her car back.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.596
What if we gave you $400?

14:48.929 --> 14:49.930
Yeah, okay.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.141
Wow. Okay. That was fast.

14:52.474 --> 14:53.767
Would you do it for 300?

14:53.851 --> 14:56.812
-No, that's not how it works.
-Okay. I wasn't sure if you knew that.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.981
I tell you what, you seem like
nice white people.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.691
You pay me cash, I'll do it for 350.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.069
Really? Okay.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.696
[scoffs] Come on in.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.658
Um, he said, "nice white people," right?

15:11.452 --> 15:15.372
Maybe he said, "Nice <i>right </i>people."
Like, we do things properly.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.416
I heard "white," but maybe.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.295
Yeah, make yourselves comfortable.
I'll get the keys.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.796
Great. Thanks, Boone.

15:23.964 --> 15:27.176
All right, I'll drive the car back to
Kayla's house, and you can pick me up.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.888
And by 8:00 p.m.,
you are gonna be balls deep in <i>bok choy.</i>

15:30.971 --> 15:32.598
-I promise.
-Thank you.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.435
Wow, look at those bookshelves.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.354
[gasps, chuckles]

15:38.437 --> 15:40.189
Looks like he built them himself.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.524
[camera shutter clicks]

15:44.360 --> 15:46.111
What the fuck?

15:46.695 --> 15:49.823
Cherry wood. And look at these corners.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.910
I guarantee you
this guy has his own miter saw.

15:53.953 --> 15:54.954
Whoa.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.497
Didn't notice that.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.166
Tongue and groove.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.670
God, I respect a man
who's unafraid to embrace the past.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.839
[suspenseful music]

16:07.967 --> 16:09.343
What the hell?

16:12.972 --> 16:13.806
Jesus.

16:13.889 --> 16:16.767
The chances these are all gifts seem slim.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.894
[whispers] This is what Kayla was
warning us about.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.020
Boone is a Nazi.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.313
Yeah.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.525
Yeah.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.527
What?

16:26.610 --> 16:28.904
Remember when we were looking
for our first person to kill,

16:28.988 --> 16:31.240
and we said,
"Who would be the perfect candidate?"

16:31.323 --> 16:33.909
-Yeah.
-Get the tarps out of the car, baby.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.246
Because we just found
our young, single Hitler!

16:38.539 --> 16:39.415
[Sheila exhales]

16:43.877 --> 16:46.630
Okey-dokey. It'll take a few minutes
to prepare the serum.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.383
Why don't you have a seat right here
and relax.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.970
You'd make a really good receptionist
at a medical or dental office.

16:53.053 --> 16:54.263
Thank you.

16:54.346 --> 16:58.267
And your calm and dispassionate demeanor
would make you a wonderful 911 operator.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.727
Thank you.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.438
I like how we're already finding
little ways to validate each other.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.940
I could get used to this.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.444
Right. Okay.

17:11.739 --> 17:12.948
Hey, isn't Ramona great?

17:13.657 --> 17:16.201
I was so worried my first time
would be with my cousin, Sophie.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.786
She gives such good massages.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.247
But now instead of doing
something creepy and desperate--

17:20.330 --> 17:23.083
-You're having sex with a dead woman.
-Undead.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.878
You know, I always thought
my obsession with the supernatural

17:25.961 --> 17:28.213
would hurt my chances with girls,
but really...

17:28.297 --> 17:30.340
it was just preparing me
for my deflowering.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.258
Why stop there?

17:31.341 --> 17:34.011
Maybe you could have a threesome
with a mermaid and a hobbit.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.514
Are you okay? You seem a little hostile.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.392
I'm fine. Let's just finish this serum
so your girlfriend's head

17:40.476 --> 17:42.352
doesn't fall off when you're porking her.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.729
Well, for your information,

17:43.812 --> 17:46.440
I recently found out
I'm a gentle, giving lover.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.653
I don't wanna kill this guy.
We talked about this, honey.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.114
We can't keep
murdering people impulsively.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.908
But there's no one here.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.577
And this is a truly bad guy

17:58.660 --> 18:01.747
who's responsible
for killing millions of people.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.791
-Indirectly.
-No.

18:03.874 --> 18:04.708
Why not?

18:04.792 --> 18:07.294
Because I gave up my haircut
and I gave up my cherry wood.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.671
And there's no scenario
where we kill this guy

18:09.755 --> 18:11.215
and I still get Chinese food.

18:12.466 --> 18:15.260
-Oh! There he is.
-Sorry it took so long.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.263
I popped a couple of Oxys before you came
and they just kicked in,

18:18.347 --> 18:21.225
-so I'm moving kind of slow.
-He's moving kind of slow.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.976
-I don't care.
-My whole body's numb.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.063
I shit you not, I slammed my finger
in the door, I felt nothing.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.564
-He feels nothing.
-I don't care.

18:27.648 --> 18:28.857
Hey, you guys like fun, right?

18:28.941 --> 18:33.695
There's a funeral down the street
for a gay, Jew lady-doctor.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.740
You wanna go shout stuff
at her colored foster kids?

18:36.824 --> 18:38.951
[sighs] Jesus. He's perfect.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.577
-Thank you.
-Not tonight.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.413
-But I just wanna eat this gentleman now.
-Did you just say you wanna--

18:43.497 --> 18:45.374
No, you're high. You misheard me.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.251
We can go get Chinese food another time.

18:47.334 --> 18:51.046
-It's always another time.
-But I'll be quick. I promise.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.133
-[door opens]
-Hey, Boone. Bad news.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.592
Oh, shit.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.220
They moved that funeral to yesterday.
Shifty Jews.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.932
I told the crew that we'd just all
hang out here tonight.

19:02.099 --> 19:02.933
Who are you?

19:03.433 --> 19:06.645
We were just leaving. [chuckles]
Right, sweetheart?

19:09.565 --> 19:10.399
Yes.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.405
Whoa. You ain't going nowhere.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.909
Not until you buy raffle tickets
for our softball team.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.454
-No, we need to skedaddle.
-Oh, hang on.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.581
You guys have a whole team?

19:26.456 --> 19:28.667
Are you all Nazi-ish?

19:28.750 --> 19:30.669
Damn right. You like Nazis?

19:30.752 --> 19:32.796
I don't know, I've never had one.

19:33.505 --> 19:37.384
-Maybe you should try one sometime.
-Oh, I definitely will.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.345
-I'll take this whole book.
-Awesome.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.848
-Hundred bucks.
-You play ball, Hume?

19:42.931 --> 19:47.102
-We're looking for a white fielder.
-Wait. Did you say "white" fielder?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.020
Right.

19:49.354 --> 19:54.026
Wait. "Right" like yes,
you need a <i>white </i>fielder,

19:54.109 --> 19:56.904
or "right" like no,
you need a <i>right </i>fielder?

19:56.987 --> 19:58.822
-What?
-Honey, let's go.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.325
Yeah, I'm done here.

20:03.118 --> 20:07.039
Okay. Holding still, holding still.

20:07.122 --> 20:09.416
I'm releasing the serum into your spine,

20:09.499 --> 20:12.211
almost there, your hair smells great.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.129
Taking the needle out...

20:14.213 --> 20:17.174
And it snapped off inside you.

20:17.633 --> 20:18.467
How do you feel?

20:19.176 --> 20:20.969
-Fine.
-Let's just leave it there.

20:21.970 --> 20:25.015
Okay, remember, this isn't a cure.
It just arrests your symptoms.

20:25.098 --> 20:28.268
-So you're gonna stay exactly as you are.
-Which is awesome.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.186
Okay.

20:30.145 --> 20:32.231
I have to be at work in ten minutes.

20:32.731 --> 20:33.941
Thanks for helping me.

20:34.024 --> 20:37.819
Wait. Before you leave, tomorrow night's
half-price at the trampoline park.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.363
-You wanna go?
-No.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.242
-Okay. How about a movie Friday night?
-No.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.618
Magic Mountain on Saturday?

20:45.202 --> 20:46.119
-No.
-No.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.373
Wow, look at us, already on the same page.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.291
I think she's blowing you off.

20:52.167 --> 20:55.337
I suspected Abby's "sick" mother
was undead,

20:55.420 --> 20:58.757
and thought she might be able to help me
with my deterioration.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.175
The only reason I slept with you

21:00.259 --> 21:02.594
was to create an emotional bond
so you'd lead me to her.

21:04.179 --> 21:05.806
But now you've fallen for me?

21:05.889 --> 21:08.475
I think your dignity
also snapped off inside her.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.979
Sorry, Eric. I got the serum,
and I don't need you anymore.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.356
We had some fun, but I'm kind of a loner.

21:14.690 --> 21:15.983
See ya later, alligator.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.735
Or... maybe never again, crocodile.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.286
Wow.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.495
[door closes]

21:30.998 --> 21:33.667
When my parents find out
there's another undead person,

21:33.750 --> 21:35.127
they're gonna freak out.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.048
How are you feeling?

21:40.299 --> 21:41.174
Not great.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.885
I shouldn't have given you
such a hard time about Ramona.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.762
No. No, it's okay.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.848
I'm sorry I couldn't stop
talking about her.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.309
I wasn't trying to make you jealous.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.435
I wasn't jealous.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.895
I was angry.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.898
-Angry?
-Yeah, you scared the hell out of me.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.652
When you called me from Ramona's,
I thought you were gonna die.

22:01.236 --> 22:02.738
I'd never see you again.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.489
I'm sorry.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.366
Don't ever do that to me again.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.328
I won't.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.419
I should clean the basement.
I promised my parents.

22:17.502 --> 22:18.503
Yeah, I should get home.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.130
-Hey, thanks for everything.
-Thank you.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.214
Yup, yup.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.349
-[Sheila chuckles]
-Mm.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.186
I'm sorry I was so insistent
on killing Boone.

22:34.269 --> 22:36.772
You know, being selfless
doesn't come easy to the undead.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.191
Hey, we made it here,
we're having our date night.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.734
I am in pork heaven.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.196
[Joel] Mm.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.492
You know what's great
about a lobster tank?

22:49.451 --> 22:50.452
[Joel] Hmm?

22:50.535 --> 22:54.456
You have a stockpile of live, fresh,
tasty food whenever you want it.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.168
Well-observed.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.050
This is my lobster tank.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.636
And these gentlemen are my lobsters.

23:07.719 --> 23:11.807
And whenever I get hungry,
we can just reach in and grab one,

23:11.890 --> 23:13.350
and have a tasty meal.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.728
Wow, Nazi-lobsters.
That's intense.

23:18.230 --> 23:22.067
But actually, right now,
I'd just like to enjoy my meal.

23:22.609 --> 23:24.945
Have one normal evening
with normal conversation.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.071
Of course.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.201
It's just that if we know who we're
gonna kill next, then we can plan better,

23:31.284 --> 23:33.120
and have more time
for non-murder-y things.

23:33.703 --> 23:36.081
But, yes, normal conversation.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.751
Look at that.
What a beautiful fish.

23:41.419 --> 23:44.631
You know the food's authentic
when they serve the fish with the head on.

23:45.841 --> 23:48.051
Speaking of,
now that we've dealt with Kayla,

23:48.135 --> 23:51.596
-we have to kill Gary's head tomorrow.
-That's right. How should we do that?

23:51.680 --> 23:54.432
Well, the weather has been great.
Something outside would be nice.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.101
We could take him to Pike's Ridge.

23:56.184 --> 23:58.937
Set him on that boulder
overlooking the valley, tell him a joke,

23:59.020 --> 24:01.815
and while he's laughing,
drive an ice pick through his brain.

24:01.898 --> 24:05.443
Oh, that's good. I was thinking we'd
count to three, but then do it on two.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.987
But your way is better.

24:08.155 --> 24:11.950
I'm sorry. I'm doing it again.
You wanted normal conversation.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.119
No, it's okay.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.788
Maybe for us, this is normal.

24:18.248 --> 24:21.084
God, I know we have to kill Gary now,
but how great would it be

24:21.168 --> 24:23.837
-to put him out for Halloween.
-Oh, my God!

24:23.920 --> 24:27.716
And we could make the Anderson's corn maze
look like the bullshit that it is.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.343
[both laughing]

24:32.387 --> 24:35.473
-No, we have to kill him tomorrow.
-Absolutely.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.395
[Gary singing]

24:41.229 --> 24:42.898
[Gary whispering] And the crowd goes wild.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.442
Go, go! Go, go!

24:45.525 --> 24:47.944
Gary! Gary!

24:48.028 --> 24:49.112
You're the best!

24:49.196 --> 24:51.698
God, ladies and gentleman, please,
you got to settle down, please.

24:51.781 --> 24:53.909
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome, Detroit.

24:53.992 --> 24:54.910
"You're in Michigan."

24:54.993 --> 24:56.453
Welcome, Michigan!

24:56.536 --> 24:59.206
Acoustics in here are not bad.

25:00.707 --> 25:03.043
Hey! What's up? I'm Gary.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.003
Not today.
