WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.199
For the last time,

00:03.230 --> 00:05.790
give me your leg.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.468
No.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.728
What is this?

00:08.770 --> 00:10.806
This is a court order,
Mr. Riley.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.808
It means we get to take
a look at your leg.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.705
Now.

00:14.740 --> 00:17.072
I don't understand
what any of this is.

00:17.110 --> 00:18.077
WATSON:
Sure you do.

00:18.110 --> 00:19.714
During the 16 months you worked

00:19.750 --> 00:21.047
as a guard at the Aster museum,

00:21.080 --> 00:22.047
you've stolen

00:22.090 --> 00:23.045
a Faberg egg,

00:23.090 --> 00:24.512
a Cape of Good Hope stamp,

00:24.550 --> 00:26.814
and a scrap
of Ancient Egyptian papyrus.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.758
That's ridiculous.

00:27.790 --> 00:29.724
HOLMES: We became
quite certain that a woman

00:29.760 --> 00:32.058
named Adrien Harper was selling
the pilfered items

00:32.100 --> 00:33.590
on the Japanese black market.

00:33.630 --> 00:35.427
But the mystery remained.

00:35.460 --> 00:37.496
Who was her inside man?

00:37.530 --> 00:38.827
We were at the opening of
the new Tiffany exhibit tonight.

00:38.870 --> 00:40.098
We saw her signal you.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.164
Mr. Riley...

00:41.200 --> 00:43.304
your prosthesis.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.083
HOLMES: Miss Harper was
actually quite discreet

01:00.120 --> 01:01.314
when signaling which item

01:01.360 --> 01:03.123
she expected you to smuggle.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.320
It was only

01:04.360 --> 01:07.295
your clumsy nods
which gave you away.

01:07.330 --> 01:09.321
Adrien Harper is
currently shackled

01:09.370 --> 01:11.668
to a table in an interview room
down the hall.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.260
Her testimony will be more
than enough to convict you.

01:14.300 --> 01:17.269
So this is all
rather superfluous.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.198
But I suppose we are
all dressed up

01:24.710 --> 01:27.178
Most prosthesis

01:27.220 --> 01:28.676
don't have a hidden compartment.

01:28.720 --> 01:29.846
Do they, Mr. Riley?

01:29.890 --> 01:31.517
NASH: Okay, you made
your point.

01:31.550 --> 01:34.155
Time to give me a minute alone
with our friend.

01:34.190 --> 01:36.351
I beg your pardon, Detective.

01:36.390 --> 01:37.880
This is our case.
We only included you--

01:37.930 --> 01:40.228
Let's not fight in front
of the perp, okay?

01:40.260 --> 01:42.399
I said I can take
it from here.

01:42.430 --> 01:44.364
Come on.

01:48.740 --> 01:50.332
Hey, I need that!

01:53.540 --> 01:55.201
We've been going
in circles for two weeks

01:55.240 --> 01:56.878
because Nash missed
the guy's prIors,

01:56.910 --> 01:58.468
and now it's
"I'll take it from here."

01:58.510 --> 02:00.239
_ The man is an
Ingrate and a clod.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.372
We'll be luclq if he checks

02:01.420 --> 02:03.183
that Riley signs
his own confession.

02:03.220 --> 02:05.916
Looks like you two had
an interesting night.

02:05.950 --> 02:07.713
HOLMES:
The museum business is settled.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.625
No thanks to Detective Nash.

02:09.660 --> 02:11.548
Oh? Is there a problem?

02:11.590 --> 02:12.921
Too many to enumerate.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.291
This chair would be a more
suitable collaborator.

02:14.330 --> 02:15.649
He's not wrong.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.565
I don't know
what to tell you guys.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.919
But if you want to be
consulting detectives,

02:18.970 --> 02:20.631
you got to consult with someone.

02:20.670 --> 02:21.932
You've burned
through half the squad

02:21.970 --> 02:24.200
since Bell transferred
to Demographics.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.901
Well aware, but I believe
I have a solution.

02:25.940 --> 02:26.804
You.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.899
You could take on
more casework yourself.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.443
I understand the rote
administrative elements

02:31.480 --> 02:32.947
of your position demand
much of your time,

02:32.980 --> 02:34.618
but you could rely
on us to carry

02:34.650 --> 02:36.186
the bulk of your
investigative load.

02:36.220 --> 02:38.211
I'm sorry, I've got

02:38.250 --> 02:41.219
some rote administrative work
to do.

02:41.260 --> 02:42.955
Why don't you take him
for a walk?

02:42.990 --> 02:45.185
Crash a prom or something.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.460
MAN:
Hashemi and Mukerji,

02:49.500 --> 02:50.967
I want you listening
to the chatter

02:51.000 --> 02:52.763
coming out of Bensonhurst.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.836
Sengupta and Theil,

02:54.870 --> 02:57.862
you're gonna vet
this Moti Bagul fella.

02:57.910 --> 03:01.277
And last but not least-- Bell.

03:01.310 --> 03:04.768
To the young man who picked
against the Knicks

03:04.810 --> 03:08.268
in the pool yesterday,
a special prize.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.244
You and, uh, Wozniak,
you get to visit

03:11.290 --> 03:13.884
Nemetz Oil Recycling.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.286
A man of advanced years called
the tip line 'cause he thought

03:16.330 --> 03:19.595
he saw a man with dark features
up to no good there.

03:21.430 --> 03:23.227
You have fun.

03:23.270 --> 03:25.226
I hear Port Morris

03:25.270 --> 03:27.465
is really beautiful this
time of year. (chuckles)

03:27.500 --> 03:29.331
Okay, that's it.

03:29.370 --> 03:32.305
Do some good out there.

03:32.340 --> 03:34.228
What did you do?

03:34.280 --> 03:35.702
Research and analysis.

03:35.740 --> 03:37.298
Thought that was the job.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.875
Yeah, not when you're picking
NBA games with the boss.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.876
That's when blind loyalty
is expected.

03:41.920 --> 03:42.989
Mm-hmm.

03:43.020 --> 03:44.487
Well, what is this?

03:44.520 --> 03:46.954
Guy was seen wheeling a
barrel onto the premises

03:46.990 --> 03:49.754
of an oil recycling
center after hours.

03:49.790 --> 03:52.759
You make a bomb, got some
toxic chemicals left over,

03:52.800 --> 03:55.325
that's a good way to make
sure they never turn up.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.328
More like someone didn't want
to pay the drop-off fee.

03:57.370 --> 03:58.962
Hey, it's field work.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.991
It's the first
I've seen in a while.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.803
Well, as long as
I'm the only one

04:02.840 --> 04:04.307
carrying a gun in
this relationship,

04:04.340 --> 04:06.672
I go where you go.

04:06.710 --> 04:08.473
So don't sign us up for
any more field work

04:08.510 --> 04:10.375
until the spring, okay?

04:10.410 --> 04:11.672
(drawer closes)

04:13.350 --> 04:15.568
MAN: I was on duty
the night you're talking about

04:15.620 --> 04:17.349
and I didn't
see a thing.

04:17.390 --> 04:18.641
IfI had to guess,

04:18.690 --> 04:20.385
this guy who called you

04:20.420 --> 04:23.355
probably just saw
Rajiv or Amit working.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.654
Got a few
Indian employees here.

04:25.690 --> 04:27.419
One of them was
probably just

04:27.460 --> 04:30.020
shuffling some inventory
toward the loading dock.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.890
What's up with
these green ones?

04:31.930 --> 04:34.364
Uh, semi-toxic stuff.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.038
Comes to us from mechanics,
service stations.

04:36.070 --> 04:38.368
They give us their used oil,

04:38.410 --> 04:39.707
we got to take their
transmission fluid

04:39.740 --> 04:41.332
and Freon in
the bargain.

04:41.380 --> 04:44.440
Those get dumped in a landfill
up near Saratoga.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.619
That's why we came.
I'm gonna have a look.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.538
I'm gonna check
the security tapes.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.286
Where it's not
nine degrees.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.389
*

05:22.420 --> 05:24.342
(taps echoing lightly)

05:24.390 --> 05:25.982
(taps thudding)

05:27.120 --> 05:29.088
BELL (muffled):
Careful.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.758
MAN (muffled):
I got it.

05:31.830 --> 05:33.024
Ugh!

05:33.060 --> 05:35.324
I think
I'm gonna be sick.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.832
This is Bronx Intel
to Central K.

05:40.870 --> 05:43.100
Please advise Captain Gregson
we need detectives

05:43.140 --> 05:46.906
and additional units at Nemetz
Oil Recycling In Port MOIâ€˜lâ€˜lS.

05:46.940 --> 05:49.545
We got a homicide here.

06:11.470 --> 06:14.462
You never call,
you never write.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.628
Yet when somebody jams
a body in a barrel...

06:17.670 --> 06:19.479
Yeah, I wish it was
a happier occasion.

06:19.510 --> 06:21.569
Now, we got a call.

06:21.610 --> 06:23.601
Tipster thought they saw
a guy wheeling a drum

06:23.650 --> 06:25.402
onto the premises
last Friday.

06:25.450 --> 06:26.542
I found the
luclq winner.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.468
How?

06:28.520 --> 06:30.579
With my eyes.

06:30.620 --> 06:32.588
UPC tag was low,

06:32.620 --> 06:34.713
but the barrel had a
fresh coat of paint.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.182
It was older
and dented.

06:36.220 --> 06:37.926
Did they get
the guy on tape?

06:37.960 --> 06:39.791
System must have been
set up by chimps.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.457
There's blind
spots all over.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.990
So, nothing
in the other barrels?

06:43.030 --> 06:44.793
Well, whoever took
this guy's head and hands

06:44.830 --> 06:47.560
knew better than to dump them
in the same spot as the body,

06:47.600 --> 06:49.636
and he's got no
clothes, no I.D.--

06:49.670 --> 06:51.900
this thing is ice cold.

06:51.940 --> 06:53.737
GREGSON:
How's the new gig?

06:53.780 --> 06:56.135
It's nice people.
Big job.

06:56.180 --> 06:58.501
But the threat
briefings we get...

06:58.550 --> 06:59.642
I used to
sleep better.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.511
HOLMES:
I've read about your detail.

07:01.550 --> 07:03.882
A municipality-- even as one
as large as New York--

07:03.920 --> 07:05.979
launching its own
counter-terrorism unit--

07:06.020 --> 07:07.453
fascinating experiment.

07:11.190 --> 07:12.657
Well, we should
get to this.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.588
Um, it was good
to see you, Marcus.
You too.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.495
Hey.
Mm-hmm?

07:20.770 --> 07:23.500
You know Bell's not gonna
hold onto that anger forever.

07:23.540 --> 07:24.734
Time heals all wounds,

07:24.770 --> 07:27.534
sometimes it just
takes a larger dose.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.468
Well, if that
were true,

07:29.510 --> 07:31.774
it would be a_ tremendous comfort
to thIs gentleman.

07:34.820 --> 07:36.617
Without a face,
dental records,

07:36.650 --> 07:39.551
or hands... even the chance
of getting some sediment

07:39.590 --> 07:40.784
from underneath
his fingernails...

07:40.820 --> 07:43.618
identification may
prove beyond our grasp.

07:43.660 --> 07:44.957
Well, we could get luclq.

07:44.990 --> 07:46.025
DNA might match somebody

07:46.060 --> 07:47.721
in the NYPD CODIS system.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.263
Well, that is a job
for a computer. Ours...

07:50.300 --> 07:52.939
is to inspect
this man's rusty tomb.

07:52.970 --> 07:54.892
Now...

07:54.940 --> 07:57.932
Well, it's the same cast
as the others, but it's older.

07:57.970 --> 07:59.904
Brought in from elsewhere,

07:59.940 --> 08:05.139
and recently painted
to match the Nemetz inventory.

08:05.180 --> 08:09.276
Barrel was previously sky blue,
which could limit

08:09.320 --> 08:11.117
our scope of inquiry to

08:11.150 --> 08:12.686
Navy shipyards...

08:12.720 --> 08:14.278
and,uh".
Handsome Bobby.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.550
Beg your pardon?

08:16.590 --> 08:19.525
I think I might
know who this is.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.222
That's him.
That's Handsome Bobby Pardillo.

08:22.260 --> 08:24.569
I take it "Tiny Bobby Pardillo"
was already taken.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.296
This was the last time
he was seen-- 21 years ago,

08:27.340 --> 08:29.160
walking out of court,
after his father

08:29.200 --> 08:30.667
was acquitted of racketeering.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.133
The body that Detective Bell
found was fresh.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.909
It was less than 72 hours old.

08:34.940 --> 08:37.647
Bobby was missing,
but he was never presumed dead.

08:37.680 --> 08:40.046
Federal undercovers heard
that he was on the lam

08:40.080 --> 08:42.810
for a beef that he had
with the Ferrara family.

08:42.850 --> 08:44.909
At the risk of stating
the obvious,

08:44.950 --> 08:47.555
uh, our body
in the barrel has got to be

08:47.590 --> 08:49.922
a couple hundred pounds lighter.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.997
These scars-- they're from
laparoscopic gastric surgery.

08:53.030 --> 08:55.089
He had lap band.
Dropped so much weight

08:55.130 --> 08:57.018
he had to have
the excess skin removed.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.265
But the knees are another
piece of the puzzle.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.564
I can't even guess how many
surgeries this guy's had.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.602
If you feel the patella,
you can tell it's artificial.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.959
Handsome Bobby was
on those crutches

09:05.010 --> 09:06.637
because Big Teddy Ferrara
had him kneecapped

09:06.680 --> 09:10.309
over gambling debts-- that's
how the whole feud started.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.614
And severing heads
and hands was SOP

09:12.650 --> 09:14.049
for the Ferrara
button men, right?

09:15.150 --> 09:16.811
What?

09:16.850 --> 09:19.751
Big Teddy, kneecapped,
button men.

09:19.790 --> 09:21.314
From where
does this expertise come?

09:21.360 --> 09:23.180
Grade school. I grew up
in Queens, there were always

09:23.230 --> 09:25.027
kids around who said
their dads were in the Mob.

09:25.060 --> 09:26.698
I was curious,
and it was fun

09:26.730 --> 09:29.153
to follow it all in papers.
The Mob was like a soap opera

09:29.200 --> 09:31.691
back then.
Oh, Handsome Bobby
was a pretty big story.

09:31.730 --> 09:33.698
I'm surprised you never
heard his name.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.264
Well, it's likely I
did, but ejected it
from my memory.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.609
Mafia law interests me _about
as much as the criminal

09:37.640 --> 09:40.131
derring-do of the Freemasons
or the druids.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.808
After decades of
police scrutiny and the
relentless tide of modernity,

09:42.850 --> 09:45.102
La Cosa Nostra poses a less
potent threat to New Yorkers

09:45.150 --> 09:46.742
than 20-ounce sodas.

09:46.780 --> 09:49.078
Give or take a
body in a barrel.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.849
Well, for now, let's just
assume that you're right.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.812
While we're waiting
for the DNA to come back,

09:52.860 --> 09:55.112
we should hit up as many
Ferrara soldiers as we can find.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.821
You think any of them will talk?

09:56.860 --> 09:58.680
HOLMES:
I doubt that their
cherished omert

09:58.730 --> 10:00.027
has held up any better
than their stranglehold

10:00.060 --> 10:01.994
on the bootleg liquor trade.

10:02.030 --> 10:04.328
But it might be advantageous to
talk to Handsome Bobby's father.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.964
He may be able to identify the
remains, and if he does,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.731
he might be able to tip us
to which of his rivals
decapitated his son.

10:10.770 --> 10:13.807
(breathing deeply)

10:13.840 --> 10:15.171
That's him.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.870
Our sympathies.

10:17.910 --> 10:20.708
Mr. Pardillo,
I'm sure you understand

10:20.750 --> 10:22.889
there's a few questions
we'd like to ask you.

10:22.920 --> 10:26.651
_ When was the last
time you saw your son?

10:26.690 --> 10:28.351
Couple of months ago.

10:28.390 --> 10:31.052
We had to keep it quiet,
as you know.

10:31.090 --> 10:33.149
He was suspected
of killing a made guy

10:33.200 --> 10:35.725
in the Ferrara family in 1992.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.069
He was a good boy.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.989
Made it big
up in Albany.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.804
Fresh start, no old ties.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.831
How did you manage
to stay in touch?

10:45.870 --> 10:47.838
It would appear

10:47.880 --> 10:48.733
that one of your
son's old enemies

10:48.780 --> 10:50.145
managed to find him.

10:50.180 --> 10:51.704
I'm wondering if
your communiqus

10:51.750 --> 10:53.377
could have been used
to trace back to him.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.411
We did e-mail.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.714
Made it look like
insurance spam.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.889
Bobby was smart,
very smart.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.957
He got surgery,
stayed out of sight.

11:02.990 --> 11:04.958
He only came into town

11:04.990 --> 11:06.696
for the doctors.

11:06.730 --> 11:08.994
We couldn't find
a good gastro guy upstate.

11:09.030 --> 11:11.362
Somebody must have spotted him
on the street.

11:12.430 --> 11:13.897
Do you have any idea who

11:13.940 --> 11:15.430
in the Ferrara family
might have done this?

11:15.470 --> 11:17.836
Some malandrine.

11:17.870 --> 11:21.829
Look, I understand Bobby rubbed
some people the wrong way.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.245
I get that.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.818
But to deny a man
a proper burial?

11:26.850 --> 11:29.444
I'm a law-abiding citizen,

11:29.480 --> 11:31.482
but if I wasn't,

11:31.520 --> 11:33.818
the mutt that done this

11:33.860 --> 11:35.816
would be in the ground tomorrow.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.828
You got
any more questions,

11:37.860 --> 11:39.851
you call my lawyer.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.327
GREGSON:
Come on, I'll walk you out.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.895
(bell dings, elevator doors
rattle open and shut)

11:47.340 --> 11:49.467
Obviously, he's intent
on retaliation.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.502
If we're gonna find the killer
before he does,

11:51.540 --> 11:53.371
I suggest you dig
into all police files

11:53.410 --> 11:55.731
pertaining to the Ferrara family
current infrastructure.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.839
The suspect may present himself.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.472
And while I'm doing that,
you're going to...

11:59.510 --> 12:01.319
Pay a visit
to the Demographics unit.

12:01.350 --> 12:03.443
If we can identify the man
that called in the tip

12:03.490 --> 12:05.287
regarding the barrel,
then he might be able

12:05.320 --> 12:07.788
to pick the killer out
of a Ferrara family photo array.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.412
You know you can just call
and find out if it's possible

12:09.460 --> 12:10.825
to locate the tipster.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.259
I could, if I was content
to trust

12:12.290 --> 12:14.929
another person's judgment
about what is possible.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.929
DA SILVA:
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but
according to our tech people,

12:17.970 --> 12:20.859
the man who saw your perp
didn't give his name.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.835
Odd.
Actually, it isn't.

12:23.870 --> 12:25.963
Uh, at least not
for the Demographics Unit.

12:26.010 --> 12:27.807
People want
to call in tips

12:27.840 --> 12:30.377
about people
from certain backgrounds,

12:30.410 --> 12:33.948
but in case they're wrong, they
don't want to come off racist.

12:33.980 --> 12:36.369
And we don't pressure
because, uh,

12:36.420 --> 12:38.547
we don't want the_ information
to stop coming in.

12:38.590 --> 12:41.912
Do we end up
on the occasional goose chase?

12:41.960 --> 12:45.987
Ye_ah. But it's worth_ it for
the intel we get that is good.

12:46.030 --> 12:48.828
And the number used
to place the call?

12:48.860 --> 12:50.293
Our tech people traced it
to a pay phone

12:50.330 --> 12:52.890
down the street
from the recycling place.

12:52.940 --> 12:56.489
Vocal analysis
tells us he's old,

12:56.540 --> 12:58.269
from the area.

12:58.310 --> 13:01.131
That narrows it down
to about a million folks.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.069
Mmm.
Anyway,
I'm sorry.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.203
Not what you wanted to hear.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.979
Well, I suppose we should be
grateful that the man thought

13:08.020 --> 13:09.476
to call it in at all.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.385
You know...
(exhales)

13:11.420 --> 13:14.389
try this number.

13:14.420 --> 13:18.584
Our tech people should be able
to... work some other angle

13:18.630 --> 13:20.928
for you.
Feel free to drop

13:20.960 --> 13:23.428
my name. I'm at your service.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.267
Actually, Deputy Commissioner,

13:25.300 --> 13:27.962
my reasons for coming to see you
were twofold.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.300
I wanted you to know that
I'm at your service as well.

13:45.550 --> 13:47.552
Holmes.

13:49.660 --> 13:51.252
What was that?
As I mentioned before,

13:51.290 --> 13:53.599
I think the work down here
is very worthy.

13:53.630 --> 13:55.598
Preventing terror attacks
and the like.

13:55.630 --> 13:58.360
And since pattern recognition is
something of a hobby of mine...

13:58.400 --> 14:00.095
Wait, you volunteered
to work here?

14:00.140 --> 14:02.062
The deputy commissioner thought
that you might object at first,

14:02.100 --> 14:03.965
given our past,
but I assured him

14:04.010 --> 14:05.898
we're both professionals
willing to put

14:05.940 --> 14:07.339
our personal differences
aside in the interest

14:07.380 --> 14:09.530
of the greater good.
Watson and I will now

14:09.580 --> 14:10.979
be splitting our time
between this unit

14:11.010 --> 14:12.307
and Captain Gregson's squad.

14:12.350 --> 14:14.910
Did I mischa_racterize
your profe55ionalism?

14:14.950 --> 14:17.339
You mischaracterized
our relationship.

14:17.390 --> 14:21.508
Perhaps what you and I require
is an airing of grievances.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.448
You have a problem with me?

14:23.490 --> 14:26.459
You seem incapable
of accepting my sincere apology.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.299
A bit petty, don't you think?

14:28.330 --> 14:30.127
What do you call latching on
to my new unit

14:30.170 --> 14:31.899
when you know
I don't want you around?

14:31.930 --> 14:33.534
For this unit?
A profound stroke of luck.

14:33.570 --> 14:35.891
I think Watson and I
could do great things here.

14:35.940 --> 14:37.407
Uh, with the help of analysts

14:37.440 --> 14:39.362
like yourself,
of course.

14:39.410 --> 14:41.935
Or do you prefer the term
"number cruncher"?

14:41.980 --> 14:43.242
This isn't over.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.271
My point.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.511
Sherlock!

14:59.060 --> 15:00.948
Should I be afraid?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.968
Let's say you wish
to cut a person's head off.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.160
To avoid a posthumous spray

15:04.200 --> 15:05.667
from your would-be victim's
jugular,

15:05.700 --> 15:08.134
you lay them facedown,
loom over them like so.

15:08.170 --> 15:09.569
I've been attacking a ham hock
from this position

15:09.600 --> 15:11.136
for the last 15 minutes,
trying to replicate

15:11.170 --> 15:12.239
the wounds that we saw.

15:12.270 --> 15:13.271
I've come _
to the conclu5ion

15:13.310 --> 15:14.334
that our killer is left-handed,

15:14.380 --> 15:16.473
probably quite tall.

15:16.510 --> 15:17.670
His name is Dante Scalice,

15:17.710 --> 15:20.144
and he's a capo
in the Ferrara family.

15:20.180 --> 15:23.013
Did you collect these people's
trading cards as a child?

15:23.050 --> 15:25.041
Actually, before tonight,
I'd never even heard of him,

15:25.090 --> 15:28.014
but he's in all the
Ferrara files and he is a fit

15:28.060 --> 15:30.028
for something
that Robert Pardillo said.

15:30.060 --> 15:32.153
Didn't it strike you as odd
that he was so outraged

15:32.190 --> 15:34.055
that his son didn't get
a proper burial

15:34.100 --> 15:35.658
and in the next breath
he's hinting

15:35.700 --> 15:37.292
that the mutt who'd done this

15:37.330 --> 15:38.991
was gonna be in the
ground tomorrow?

15:39.030 --> 15:41.169
I thought it was
a simple quid pro quo.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.134
I don't think _"mutt"
was a generic slur.

15:43.170 --> 15:45.138
I think it was a slip
of the tongue, Pardillo's way

15:45.170 --> 15:47.331
of referencing
the killer's mixed ancestry.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.008
Dante Scalice's father
is from Sicily.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.348
His mother is from Israel.
In the Jewish faith,

15:52.380 --> 15:55.178
the dead are supposed to be
buried as quickly as possible.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.609
So Pardillo is a respectful
angel of vengeance

15:57.650 --> 16:00.187
looking to honor the customs
of his would-be victim?

16:00.220 --> 16:03.053
I know it doesn't sound like
much, but take a look at this.

16:03.090 --> 16:04.626
These were taken
from a raid

16:04.660 --> 16:07.094
last year, in New Jersey,
at a club.

16:07.130 --> 16:09.758
Dante Scalice
owns the place.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.064
Check out the _barrel
they use for collecting grease.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.988
Sky blue.
Just like the one

16:14.040 --> 16:17.999
Handsome Bobby was stuffed into
before someone painted it green.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.179
Well, I don't think it's
enough evidence for an arrest,

16:20.210 --> 16:22.337
but perhaps
we can find some more.

16:25.210 --> 16:27.417
You really think
he did it here?

16:27.450 --> 16:30.749
You know what? All this stuff's
over a week old.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.746
I'm starting
to think Mr. Scalice...

16:32.790 --> 16:35.054
hasn't cleaned_ house
Since the crime.

16:35.090 --> 16:38.253
We can't go inside.
His car's right there.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.155
He's obviously home.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.656
(dog barking)

16:42.830 --> 16:44.422
That's our cue.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.132
(door opens)

16:48.170 --> 16:50.661
Hey.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.268
The hell'd you do
to my garbage?

16:52.310 --> 16:55.108
Mr. Scalice, we're
consultants for the NYPD.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.404
There's no point in denying it.
We're investigating you

16:57.450 --> 17:00.169
for the murder of
Robert Pardillo, Jr.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.074
I don't know what you're talking
about or what you're doing here,

17:02.120 --> 17:04.384
but unless you have a warrant,
you need to go.

17:04.420 --> 17:06.308
I just told you that
Handsome Bobby was dead.

17:06.350 --> 17:08.079
You don't find
that surprising?

17:08.120 --> 17:09.519
WATSON:
Where were you
last Friday night?

17:09.560 --> 17:11.084
I have an alibi.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.223
I have an alibi
for any time you want.

17:13.260 --> 17:15.524
But I got nothing to say to you
unless you have a warrant.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.222
Well, in that case, we'll
just come back later.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.231
Calling Captain Gregson?

17:24.270 --> 17:25.498
He'll need to send men

17:25.540 --> 17:27.076
to Scalice's nightclub
in New Jersey.

17:27.110 --> 17:28.372
There might still
be evidence there.

17:28.410 --> 17:29.729
But after
that cock-up,

17:29.780 --> 17:31.600
the chances of him
spending a day in prison

17:31.650 --> 17:33.208
just plummeted.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.687
I was right.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.711
Not one day in prison.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.668
Bomb squad thinks the explosive
used was Tovex.

17:50.700 --> 17:53.669
Real popular
in building demolition.

17:53.700 --> 17:55.634
Half the Pardillo family's
revenue comes

17:55.670 --> 17:57.262
from construction and concrete.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.460
They sell union books,
work no-show jobs, but...

17:59.510 --> 18:01.671
Yeah, the problem is
they all use the same stuff.

18:01.710 --> 18:04.178
That's why Tovex is damn
near impossible to trace.

18:04.210 --> 18:05.746
If we don't get
the evidence to charge

18:05.780 --> 18:09.409
Pardillo quick, this might just
be the first shot fired.

18:09.450 --> 18:11.839
There hasn't been anything like
a Mob war since I was a kid.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.256
Yeah? Well,
this is how they start.

18:14.290 --> 18:15.257
MAN_:
Captain,

18:15.290 --> 18:16.518
Holmes is asking for you inside.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.755
All right.

18:18.790 --> 18:21.759
This sliver of supraorbital
ridge is all that remains

18:21.800 --> 18:23.722
of Handsome Bobby's head.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.897
If the man didn't
have such

18:25.930 --> 18:29.263
a Neanderthal brow, it would've
dissolved with the rest of him.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.404
Scalice left that
on the stove?

18:31.440 --> 18:33.738
No, I found it in the cupboard
beneath the sink.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.429
I suppose if one

18:35.480 --> 18:37.368
must witness a fireball
consume a human life,

18:37.410 --> 18:39.605
let it be a man who dissolves
heads in battery acid.

18:39.650 --> 18:41.208
Well, odds are

18:41.250 --> 18:43.218
that's closure on the
Handsome Bobby case,

18:43.250 --> 18:45.582
but it also means that
the goalposts just moved.

18:45.620 --> 18:46.587
Pardillo, Sr.

18:46.620 --> 18:50.158
Mmm. We gotta hang
this car bombing on him quick.

18:50.190 --> 18:52.329
The last thing we need is
for this thing to escalate.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.157
Well, I'll get back
into the files,

18:54.200 --> 18:55.792
see which one
of Pardillo's soldiers

18:55.830 --> 18:57.798
might've planted the bomb
in Scalice's car.

18:57.830 --> 18:59.798
That is one course
of action, yes.

18:59.830 --> 19:03.129
But this bucket is not the only
thing of interest I found here.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.206
WATSON:
They're e-mails.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.901
They're correspondence
exchanged between

19:09.940 --> 19:11.407
the recently decapitated
Handsome Bobby

19:11.450 --> 19:12.849
and his father Robert.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.815
How did Scalice
get his hands on these?

19:15.850 --> 19:18.683
Probably the same way he got
hold of Bobby's phone records.

19:18.720 --> 19:19.880
A care package

19:19.920 --> 19:22.855
from your National
Security Agency.

19:25.230 --> 19:28.199
I don't have a clue what
you want me to do with this.

19:28.230 --> 19:29.788
HOLMES:
An acknowledgment

19:29.830 --> 19:31.866
that the American government is
in bed with the American Mafia

19:31.900 --> 19:33.959
would be a lovely place
to start.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.968
Said government's reasons
for wanting

19:36.000 --> 19:38.560
Handsome Bobby Pardillo dead
would be even lovelier.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.828
For the last time, I don't work
for the government.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.542
I do Web development--
that's what we do here.

19:43.580 --> 19:46.549
Mr. McNally-- if that is indeed
your real name--

19:46.580 --> 19:49.344
please be advised that
this is not Ms. Watson and 1's

19:49.380 --> 19:52.884
first time engaging with the
American Intelligence community.

19:52.920 --> 19:56.356
I_would be remiss if I delved
into our preVIous dealings,

19:56.390 --> 19:59.951
but suffice it to say that yours
is one of several NSA fronts

19:59.990 --> 20:01.855
that I have identified
in the last 18 months.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.960
Lantera Digital Solutions
does not exist.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.422
It is a cheap facade

20:06.470 --> 20:07.767
with an expensive view,

20:07.800 --> 20:09.267
and it would calm my
nerves considerably

20:09.300 --> 20:11.905
if we could all just be
adult and admit as much.

20:11.940 --> 20:13.908
We found those printouts
at the home

20:13.940 --> 20:16.602
of a high-ranking member
of the Ferrara crime family.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.904
They're copies of e-mail
correspondence between

20:18.950 --> 20:20.918
Robert Pardillo
and his son Bobby--

20:20.950 --> 20:23.544
disguised as spam,
but apparently not well enough.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.784
Bobby's dead now.

20:24.820 --> 20:27.812
There are also
phone records.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.420
Impossible to explain,
as they're only days old.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.883
They were generated
by someone or something

20:32.930 --> 20:35.649
with access to a cell phone
carrier's computer system.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.668
You are holding the means
by which a killer

20:37.700 --> 20:38.962
triangulated
his victim's location

20:39.000 --> 20:41.560
and hunted him down.

20:41.600 --> 20:46.799
These unassuming alphanumeric
sequences are stamped on

20:46.840 --> 20:50.640
every document which is
generated by the PRISM system,

20:50.680 --> 20:52.898
PRISM being a proprietary
program which was created

20:52.950 --> 20:56.010
for the sole use of the
National Security Agency.

20:56.050 --> 20:58.348
I'm not a deranged lunatic,
Mr. McNally,

20:58.390 --> 21:00.278
but, by all means,
keep pushing me.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.878
I'm not saying
anything because

21:01.920 --> 21:05.583
I don't know anything.
This is a Web development shop.

21:05.630 --> 21:09.020
Well, I suppose all we can do
is thank you for your time.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.994
Yeah. Sorry I can't help
with anything else.

21:11.030 --> 21:15.763
Even so, please expect
a small token of our gratitude.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.598
Did you know that there are
several subscription-based

21:18.640 --> 21:20.403
Web sites for plushy
enthusiasts?

21:20.440 --> 21:21.839
And it would
be my great pleasure

21:21.880 --> 21:22.835
to treat you to a membership

21:22.880 --> 21:24.040
with each and every one of them.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.605
If I'm wrong about what
you do here,

21:26.650 --> 21:27.674
then you will not
have to explain

21:27.720 --> 21:28.869
to your Federal overlords

21:28.920 --> 21:30.945
why you find stuffed
animals so arousing.

21:33.620 --> 21:34.882
(door shuts)

21:43.100 --> 21:44.465
Hey.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.762
Hey.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.734
I heard you lost a
suspect this morning.

21:50.770 --> 21:52.408
I'm glad you're okay.
Yeah.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.977
I'm picking up the bomb squad's
report right now.

21:55.010 --> 21:57.706
What-What brings you back?

21:57.750 --> 22:00.947
Um, I'm actually here
to talk to the captain

22:00.980 --> 22:03.949
about this time-sharing plan
your partner's got.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.844
You two helping out
in Demographics?

22:05.890 --> 22:07.983
Sorry, but I don't think
it can work.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.848
Wait-- what?

22:10.890 --> 22:13.358
Yeah, we deal with
sensitive material over there.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.027
Our CI's are skittish.

22:15.060 --> 22:16.994
A little friction
could lead to big problems.

22:17.030 --> 22:17.962
I just don't think

22:18.000 --> 22:20.389
his bull-in-a-china-shop
routine is a good fit.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.829
When Sherlock dropped by
your unit yesterday...

22:22.870 --> 22:24.565
He_volunt_eered
his serwces.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.464
He didn't tell you?

22:26.510 --> 22:29.377
I'm sorry-- I doubt
I get a real vote
in this, anyway,

22:29.410 --> 22:31.799
but you gotta get
why I don't want
to see him around.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.579
For what it's worth,
he's really...

22:33.620 --> 22:35.645
I know, I know, but can
you do me a favor?

22:35.680 --> 22:39.013
'Cause he listens to you.
Can you tell him to back off?

22:47.160 --> 22:49.720
(muffled explosion)

22:52.030 --> 22:54.032
(muffled explosion)

22:58.210 --> 23:00.906
So... cadmium?

23:00.940 --> 23:02.828
Well, according to the bomb
squad, there wasn't any...

23:02.880 --> 23:04.575
What are you...
what are you doing?

23:04.610 --> 23:06.498
I'm detonating a series
of controlled explosions

23:06.550 --> 23:09.110
using Tovex,
the main ingredient used

23:09.150 --> 23:12.813
in the bomb
which killed Dante Scalice.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.011
(coughs) If we
can tie the bomb

23:15.060 --> 23:17.449
to a particular Pardillo
construction site,

23:17.490 --> 23:21.051
then we can shift our
focus to the NSA strand
of the investigation.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.852
It's not the first time,

23:22.900 --> 23:24.527
of course, that your
government was thought

23:24.570 --> 23:26.526
to have ties to the Mob.
It was theorized

23:26.570 --> 23:29.789
that the CIA teamed up
with the Mafia in 1963

23:29.840 --> 23:31.137
to assassinate JFK.

23:31.170 --> 23:32.967
Not true, of course.

23:33.010 --> 23:34.932
The truth is
much stranger.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.403
Inconclusive, again.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.638
You know...
I have an idea.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.545
Why don't we call
our new boss,

23:42.580 --> 23:43.842
Deputy Commissioner
Da Silva?

23:43.890 --> 23:45.448
I'm sure he can

23:45.490 --> 23:48.118
put you in touch
with an explosives expert.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.980
I was gonna tell you.

23:50.020 --> 23:51.885
You should have.
I would have explained

23:51.930 --> 23:54.148
how little interest
I have in working

23:54.200 --> 23:56.555
for Demographics.
The unit is swimming with data.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.899
It's a fascinating vantage point
from which to view the city.
I can understand

23:59.930 --> 24:01.693
why sifting through
the world's biggest haystack

24:01.740 --> 24:03.708
would appeal to you,
but we both know

24:03.740 --> 24:06.208
that is not what
this is about.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.777
Detective Nash
and the museum thief.

24:08.810 --> 24:11.176
Detective Petersen
and the Somalian chef.

24:11.210 --> 24:15.146
Since Bell left, we've had
one bad date after another.

24:15.180 --> 24:16.875
You're trying to force
some sort of reunion,

24:16.920 --> 24:18.547
because you don't like
consulting for anyone else.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.956
I'm hardly that naive.
Even ifI did think

24:20.990 --> 24:23.208
(cell phone chimes)
the relationship
was reparable...

24:28.700 --> 24:31.760
Interesting.
It appears...

24:31.800 --> 24:33.062
Yes?

24:33.100 --> 24:34.931
Actually,
I'm not at liberty to say.

24:34.970 --> 24:37.666
I'll be back
by morning.

24:37.710 --> 24:40.270
You won't want to touch
any of this while I'm gone.

24:40.310 --> 24:42.699
(elevator bell dings)

24:55.190 --> 24:57.181
McNALLY:
Mr. Holmes.

24:58.860 --> 25:01.249
Coded text messages,

25:01.300 --> 25:02.255
frequency jammer,

25:02.300 --> 25:04.518
meeting in an unfinished
sewage treatment plant--

25:04.570 --> 25:06.094
you must be
the most security-conscious

25:06.130 --> 25:07.893
Web developer at Lantara.

25:07.940 --> 25:11.307
My superiors insisted
we not be seen together.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.672
You're meant to understand
that this is, by no means,

25:13.710 --> 25:15.735
an invitation for you to
visit our office again.

25:15.780 --> 25:19.204
We saw the records
you found.

25:19.250 --> 25:22.242
We had to make sure
we didn't have a breach,
a backdoor into our system.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.214
We don't.
PRISM is secure.

25:24.250 --> 25:26.684
So you're saying
the NSA has a mole?

25:26.720 --> 25:28.950
No, I'm not.

25:28.990 --> 25:31.925
Someone at the agency
found Bobby Pardillo

25:31.960 --> 25:34.599
via his e-mails and
his phone records,
so unless you're

25:34.630 --> 25:36.257
telling me that Dante
Scalice is moonlighting

25:36.300 --> 25:39.167
as a government cryptologist,
you have a leak.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.930
This came through channels.

25:41.970 --> 25:44.200
It was requested by a cop.

25:46.210 --> 25:49.338
So you would have me believe
that the NSA makes a habit

25:49.380 --> 25:51.143
of conducting
electronic surveillance

25:51.180 --> 25:53.205
of questionable legality
for any local authority

25:53.250 --> 25:54.911
who requests it?

25:54.950 --> 25:57.248
No. NYPD has a unit--
Demographics, it's called.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.145
They work to prevent
terrorist attacks.

25:59.190 --> 26:02.079
Yes, I am familiar
with that group.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.281
What Deputy Commissioner
Da Silva wants, he gets.

26:04.330 --> 26:07.288
He wanted Robert
Pardillo Jr. found.

26:07.330 --> 26:09.218
That said, the events

26:09.260 --> 26:12.161
of the last few days
aren't sitting right
with some of my bosses.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.895
We thought
you should know.

26:13.940 --> 26:17.330
Did the deputy commissioner
say why he wanted him found?

26:17.370 --> 26:20.168
No. He protects eight
million lives, Mr. Holmes.

26:20.210 --> 26:22.269
He doesn't need to say why.

26:29.220 --> 26:31.188
He told you Deputy Commissioner
Da Silva is dirty,

26:31.220 --> 26:32.881
as in Bell's_ new boss
Da Silva?

26:32.920 --> 26:35.980
It has the ring
of truth.
It has the ring

26:36.020 --> 26:38.887
of something-- you yanked his
chain, now he's yanking yours.

26:40.190 --> 26:42.055
The Demographics Unit
is in touch with half

26:42.100 --> 26:44.921
the country's
intelligence-gathering agencies.

26:44.970 --> 26:47.791
Now, if Da Silva was to give
even the flimsiest

26:47.840 --> 26:50.229
counterterrorism context
for wanting Pardillo Jr. found,

26:50.270 --> 26:52.704
then no good spook is going
to blink at that request.

26:52.740 --> 26:55.129
Well, why would he do
something like that?
Historically,

26:55.180 --> 26:57.671
money is the most effective
corruptor of lawmen.

26:57.710 --> 27:00.747
But there's always
the possibility that
the Ferrara family

27:00.780 --> 27:02.270
made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.788
Either way, Da Silva gave
the command, and a man

27:04.820 --> 27:07.311
who had eluded the Mafia
for more than two decades

27:07.350 --> 27:09.386
was found in a
few keystrokes.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.285
So what now?

27:11.330 --> 27:13.321
If we're gonna make
an allegation against

27:13.360 --> 27:15.294
the fourth-highest-ranking
police official in New York,

27:15.330 --> 27:17.764
we're gonna need more than
the shadovw utterances

27:17.800 --> 27:19.825
of some third-rate
Deep Throat.

27:19.870 --> 27:23.931
Investigating Da Silva
without alerting him is
going to be a challenge.

27:23.970 --> 27:26.768
We're going to
need some help.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.808
BELL: You guys are
really something.

27:29.840 --> 27:33.207
I can only imagine
what it must sound like.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.877
I'm sorry.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.217
(scoffs):
For which part?

27:36.250 --> 27:38.684
Lying and telling me
you needed me to come here

27:38.720 --> 27:40.915
to answer questions about
the morning I found the corpse,

27:42.360 --> 27:43.918
very well plot against him
at your office.

27:43.960 --> 27:46.224
Given the commissioner's
electronic omnisaence,

27:46.260 --> 27:49.821
I thought it wise
to provide a credible
pretext for our meeting.

27:49.860 --> 27:51.828
Just in case.
He's not corrupt.

27:51.870 --> 27:53.929
You don't have a shred of proof

27:53.970 --> 27:56.097
against him.
These accusations
are not my own.

27:56.140 --> 27:57.903
They come
from the NSA.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.430
But you are correct--

27:59.470 --> 28:01.404
we have no proof.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.101
That's why
you're here.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.199
Well...

28:05.250 --> 28:07.275
forget it.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.972
He assigned you
to investigate
an anonymous tip,

28:10.020 --> 28:13.319
which led directly
to the discovery of
Handsome Bobby's remains.

28:13.350 --> 28:15.352
Now, I cannot

28:15.390 --> 28:18.882
currently explain why
he may have wanted them found...

28:18.930 --> 28:20.898
but it's a startling coincidence

28:20.930 --> 28:23.967
that his was the name
the NSA decided to drop.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.867
Maybe you're just not as smart
as you think you are.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.993
Maybe the biggest
spy agency

28:29.040 --> 28:31.338
on the planet managed
to sell you a line.

28:31.370 --> 28:32.962
It's possible.

28:33.010 --> 28:35.331
But we want_ to make sure.
Bear in mind,

28:35.380 --> 28:37.132
if your boss
did decide to out Bobby,

28:37.180 --> 28:39.171
it's possible he did so
for a very good reason.

28:39.210 --> 28:40.848
The man may have
been a pederast,

28:40.880 --> 28:42.472
or a homegrown terrorist,
or both.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.044
I can conceive
of any number

28:44.090 --> 28:45.341
of _scenarios where
this all gets swept

28:45.390 --> 28:47.517
under the rug, but we
should know the truth

28:47.550 --> 28:50.348
before we decide,
don't you agree?

28:50.390 --> 28:53.791
You know, I expect
this kind of garbage from him.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.889
Excuse me.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.003
Detective?
Uh, you said your piece.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.201
I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to you
smear a good cop.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.003
It's not about smearing,
this is about...

29:09.040 --> 29:11.042
What is it with you?! Huh?

29:11.080 --> 29:13.071
What, I-I won't
forgive you,
so you want

29:13.110 --> 29:16.045
to send me on a witch hunt,
wreck my career?

29:16.080 --> 29:18.082
Oh, your "career"? Is that
what you're calling it, is it?

29:18.120 --> 29:19.883
Sitting behind a desk,
analyzing data?

29:19.920 --> 29:22.115
Oh, I'm sorry, wasn't it
you who, just two days ago,

29:22.160 --> 29:24.025
told my boss you wanted
a piece of the action?

29:24.060 --> 29:26.028
I was attempting to get
a rise out of you,

29:26.060 --> 29:28.153
to remind you that
no matter where you go

29:28.200 --> 29:30.054
or how tedious
the work you undertake,

29:30.100 --> 29:32.193
it will not change what
you are-- a detective.

29:32.230 --> 29:33.959
I am a detective.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.558
Well, you still carry
the title, yeah.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.329
But it's more than that,
isn't it?

29:37.370 --> 29:39.964
It's a calling.
It's your calling.

29:40.010 --> 29:43.036
You are not an analyst;
you are not an assessor of data.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.105
You transferred from Major
Crimes either because your pride

29:45.150 --> 29:47.914
would not allow you to occupy
the same space as me

29:47.950 --> 29:49.872
or because you're feeling
sorry for yourself.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.444
In either case,
a pathetic excuse.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.446
I have a tremor in my hand.

29:53.490 --> 29:56.254
I can't shoot,
can't get out on the street

29:56.290 --> 29:58.588
and work cases because of you!

29:58.630 --> 30:01.394
Bollocks! You could've _
stayed in Major Crimes until
you completed your rehab!

30:01.430 --> 30:03.967
You're assuming my rehab
can be completed!

30:04.000 --> 30:05.262
Because I have
faith in you!

30:05.300 --> 30:06.961
I have faith in
your perseverance!

30:08.270 --> 30:10.238
Be my friend,
don't be my friend--

30:10.270 --> 30:12.101
whatever--
but don't be so foolish

30:12.140 --> 30:15.507
as to confuse punishing me
with punishing yourself!

30:17.310 --> 30:20.939
You know what I thought
the first time I met you?

30:22.350 --> 30:24.910
Man, it comes easy
for that guy.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.247
Oh.

30:26.290 --> 30:28.383
Well, I'm sorry.

30:28.420 --> 30:31.583
It doesn't come that easy
to the rest of us.

30:31.630 --> 30:35.191
I am a drug addict, Marcus.

30:35.230 --> 30:36.492
A drug addict.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.919
And it might seem
like an abstraction to you

30:38.970 --> 30:41.165
_ because I have been sober
Since I made your acquaintance.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.634
But two years ago,
I was as pitiable a soul

30:43.670 --> 30:45.137
as you will ever meet.

30:47.010 --> 30:49.308
With help, I fought back,

30:49.340 --> 30:52.343
and I got a little bit better.

30:52.380 --> 30:56.248
I know what I'm supposed
to do with my life.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.078
Do you?

31:09.400 --> 31:12.221
(sighs)
This doesn't feel right.

31:13.700 --> 31:17.067
Well, forget your fantasies
of stone-walled Mafia compounds,

31:17.100 --> 31:19.568
it's actually quite a good place
to "go to the mattresses."

31:19.610 --> 31:21.202
It's incongruous.

31:21.240 --> 31:23.379
I'm not saying that we've
got the wrong place.

31:23.410 --> 31:25.549
I don't think Big Teddy's
mistress lied to us.

31:25.580 --> 31:28.515
Neither would you with
the threat of deportation
hanging over your head.

31:28.550 --> 31:30.415
Rather fiendish of you.

31:33.320 --> 31:36.983
of accusing a violent
crime boss of having
a cop on the take

31:37.020 --> 31:38.578
without backup.

31:38.630 --> 31:42.350
Well, I suppose we could
always announce our arrival.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.095
(blowing whistle loudly)

31:44.130 --> 31:46.428
All right, make it quick.

31:46.470 --> 31:49.598
Couple of...
police errand boys

31:49.640 --> 31:52.165
(chuckles):
or whatever you are.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.371
Well, actually, Mr. Ferrara,
we suspect you

31:54.410 --> 31:57.436
of having a police errand boy
of your own, and that's

31:57.480 --> 31:58.947
why we're here.

31:58.980 --> 32:00.447
That right?
You fancy yourself

32:00.480 --> 32:03.938
a businessman-- so which
of these deals sounds better?

32:03.990 --> 32:06.982
You tell us how Dante Scalice
managed to locate

32:07.020 --> 32:10.080
Handsome Bobby Pardillo,
and in exchange,

32:10.120 --> 32:11.348
we will not divulge

32:11.390 --> 32:13.187
your assistance.
Or...

32:13.230 --> 32:15.653
don't tell us what you know,
and you can add

32:15.700 --> 32:18.260
two new enemies _
to a long and growmg list.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.359
(chuckles)
You threatening me?

32:20.400 --> 32:22.231
We think it's only
a matter of time

32:22.270 --> 32:24.067
before police prove
that Scalice was working

32:24.110 --> 32:27.432
under your orders
when he killed Bobby Pardillo.

32:27.470 --> 32:28.607
Give us the name
of the officer

32:28.640 --> 32:30.471
we believe you have
on your payroll,

32:30.510 --> 32:32.546
and we will talk to our captain,
see if a deal can't be struck.

32:32.580 --> 32:34.275
We don't have a cop.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.345
Dante didn't have a cop.

32:36.380 --> 32:39.588
And if one of you has sent him
that packet, it's news to me,

32:39.620 --> 32:41.588
and it's your problem.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.485
Packet?

32:43.520 --> 32:46.057
FERRARA: Dante got it in
the mail ten days ago,
out of nowhere.

32:46.090 --> 32:48.058
"A bolt from the blue," he said.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.024
Telling me that there's all
this crap about our old friend.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.423
I said to him, "You know what?

32:52.470 --> 32:55.689
Who cares about
Bobby Pardillo anymore?"

32:55.740 --> 32:59.301
You think I like being out here
in the sticks

32:59.340 --> 33:01.001
with a gun under my pillow?

33:02.640 --> 33:05.768
See, I didn't tell him
to do what he did.

33:05.810 --> 33:10.213
And you can take that back
to your, uh, pigpen.

33:10.250 --> 33:14.050
Sir, uh, Casey said I might
be able to get a minute?

33:14.090 --> 33:15.455
Of course.

33:15.490 --> 33:17.651
I just wanted to talk
to you about something.

33:17.690 --> 33:19.749
When Holmes came over here
the other day,

33:19.790 --> 33:21.758
he asked you
about the tip we got

33:21.800 --> 33:24.496
about the barrels?
Yeah.

33:24.530 --> 33:26.327
It's just... he reached out
to me this morning.

33:26.370 --> 33:27.667
He thought the tip
might have been fake.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.531
(scoffs)
Fake?

33:29.570 --> 33:33.301
He thinks maybe someone
wanted us to find that body.

33:33.340 --> 33:35.501
To what end?

33:35.540 --> 33:37.531
Not a clue.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.469
But that's sort of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

33:40.510 --> 33:43.070
You know my history
with the guy, and now you see

33:43.120 --> 33:44.815
that some of the theories
he comes up With

33:44.850 --> 33:46.408
can be pretty out there,

33:46.450 --> 33:48.315
and I just don't think

33:48.360 --> 33:51.488
he'll be a good fit around here.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.657
Consider him gone.

33:53.690 --> 33:55.829
I trust your judgment.

33:55.860 --> 33:58.420
Just not about the Knicks.

33:58.470 --> 34:01.394
WATSON: We officially need
a new pizza place.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.089
This one is taking forever!

34:03.140 --> 34:05.608
We visit a Mobster in hiding,
and you order Italian.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.335
Can a Godfather marathon
be far behind?

34:07.370 --> 34:08.632
It certainly seemed

34:08.680 --> 34:10.568
like Big Teddy was
telling the truth, right?

34:10.610 --> 34:12.168
But if Da Silva wasn't working

34:12.210 --> 34:13.609
for the Ferraras,
I don't get it.

34:13.650 --> 34:15.572
There is no trace of any grudge

34:15.620 --> 34:16.814
against Handsome Bobby
in the old case files.

34:16.850 --> 34:19.114
Well, perhaps the motive
is not from the past,

34:19.150 --> 34:20.515
but from the present.

34:20.550 --> 34:21.585
We must ask ourselves,

34:21.620 --> 34:23.611
"What might compel

34:23.660 --> 34:26.288
"a decorated officer
to risk his career

34:26.330 --> 34:29.356
_ in order to facilitate the
demise of a washed-up gangster?"

34:29.400 --> 34:32.267
(knocking on door)
Oh. Finally.

34:32.300 --> 34:35.497
(sighs)
You know what?

34:35.540 --> 34:38.703
Maybe after dinner,
we can... Marcus.

34:40.170 --> 34:41.501
Come in.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.303
Thanks.

34:47.710 --> 34:50.315
So, I, uh...

34:50.350 --> 34:52.648
I had a talk
with the deputy commissioner.

34:52.690 --> 34:53.816
You shared our suspicions?

34:53.850 --> 34:56.387
I asked him about
the tipster,

34:56.420 --> 34:58.650
same as you,
and he didn't blink.

34:58.690 --> 35:00.851
He was comfortable, open.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.120
But there was something
in his voice.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.390
It bothered me.
Couldn't tell you why.

35:05.430 --> 35:07.421
You have instincts.

35:07.470 --> 35:09.290
My point is,
I wanted to know.

35:09.340 --> 35:10.659
I had to.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.258
So I walked him out,

35:12.310 --> 35:14.369
and I doubled back.

35:14.410 --> 35:16.537
Found this in
his office.

35:16.580 --> 35:17.899
What is it?

35:17.940 --> 35:20.602
Proof that you were right.
He's dirty.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.180
It's a career case.
It's three career cases.

35:29.220 --> 35:31.359
The deputy commissioner
has enough there

35:31.390 --> 35:32.926
to put Robert Pardillo
behind bars

35:32.960 --> 35:35.394
for about a thousand years.

35:35.430 --> 35:36.852
Well, if you line up
the sentences

35:36.900 --> 35:38.367
back to back,
you might be right.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.618
Accessory to
murder, racketeering,

35:40.670 --> 35:42.365
tampering with union elections.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.858
I still can't believe
how old some of this stuff is.

35:45.910 --> 35:48.276
Da Silva must have been working
on this since the '705.

35:48.310 --> 35:49.709
BELL: It makes no sense.
He had the goods

35:49.740 --> 35:52.470
on a Mob boss for over 30 years,
never told a soul.

35:52.510 --> 35:55.240
Then he flips the guy's son
to his enemies?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.508
This was in the file.

35:56.550 --> 35:58.211
Yeah, I noticed.

35:58.250 --> 36:01.549
The handwriting
is Robert Pardillo's.

36:01.590 --> 36:04.423
I just compared it to a sample
the police had on file.

36:04.460 --> 36:06.325
The article was written
12 days ago,

36:06.360 --> 36:08.328
a mere 48 hours
before Dante Scalice

36:08.360 --> 36:11.420
received the packet which helped
him locate Handsome Bobby.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.825
Everything else in the dossier
predates the Internet.

36:13.870 --> 36:16.634
This could be the straw that
broke the camel's back.

36:16.670 --> 36:19.309
But it's just an article
on a union election.

36:19.340 --> 36:20.967
It could also be
the Rosetta Stone

36:21.010 --> 36:23.274
which unlocks the meaning of the
file, and gives us Da Silva's

36:23.310 --> 36:25.471
true motive.
Which was?

36:25.510 --> 36:27.307
He sacrificed Pardillo
Junior in an effort

36:27.350 --> 36:29.318
to wriggle out from under
Pardillo Senior's thumb.

36:29.350 --> 36:30.772
That doesn't make any sense.

36:30.820 --> 36:32.742
Doesn't it?
Think it through.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.849
The oldest evidence here
dates back

36:34.890 --> 36:38.485
to Da Silva's first year
as a beat cop in Murray Hill.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.929
He's been cleaning up

36:39.960 --> 36:41.825
the Pardillo family's
messiest missteps

36:41.860 --> 36:43.919
since he joined the force,
which strongly suggests why

36:43.960 --> 36:46.360
he was put on the force
in the first place.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.368
Da Silva is Deputy Commissioner.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.594
You think he's a Mob plant?

36:49.640 --> 36:52.461
At first.
But as you say, he rose.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.705
You_can't achieve his rank
Via subterfuge alone.

36:54.740 --> 36:57.379
He was, by all accounts,
an excellent police officer.

36:57.410 --> 37:00.800
I believe_he was converted
to his new cause.

37:00.850 --> 37:02.715
The guy's closing in
on a gold watch.

37:02.750 --> 37:05.412
It's a little late in the day
to grow a conscience,

37:05.450 --> 37:07.884
don't you think?
Louis Martinez.

37:07.920 --> 37:08.955
His candidate
for treasurer

37:08.990 --> 37:10.719
of the local 127--

37:10.760 --> 37:13.854
a construction union which has
prowded health benefits

37:13.890 --> 37:16.723
and a steady income to the
Pardillo family for the last

37:16.760 --> 37:18.318
50 years.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.463
Martinez is a reformist,
churchgoing citizen.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.434
His election would be
a crippling blow

37:22.470 --> 37:24.028
to a decaying
crime family.

37:24.070 --> 37:25.799
That clipping...

37:25.840 --> 37:29.276
Is a death sentence--
yes, I suspect so.

37:29.310 --> 37:30.834
(knocking on door)
Oh.

37:33.510 --> 37:36.274
BELL:_You're not
suggesting Da Silva's

37:36.320 --> 37:38.311
been ordered to kill
this Martinez guy?

37:38.350 --> 37:40.409
His role will
most likely be

37:40.450 --> 37:43.317
to cover up the murder, as it
has been so often in the past.

37:43.360 --> 37:46.488
BELL: All right,
back up a second.

37:46.530 --> 37:47.929
Why have Handsome Bobby killed?

37:47.960 --> 37:49.496
Having him killed

37:49.530 --> 37:50.929
was not the point.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.393
Having him found dead was.

37:52.430 --> 37:53.727
And with due respect
to your contribution,

37:53.770 --> 37:55.465
Da Silva orchestrated

37:55.500 --> 37:56.967
both the death
and the discovery.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.763
I imagine that he tracked

37:58.810 --> 38:01.472
Scalice's progress
with an assist from Big Brother.

38:01.510 --> 38:04.479
He wanted a Mob war.
A chain reaction

38:04.510 --> 38:06.068
of violent reprisals

38:06.110 --> 38:08.340
which would at least
weaken the Pardillo family.

38:08.380 --> 38:10.439
At best, it would result
in the death

38:10.480 --> 38:12.448
of the one man_
who knew his origins.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.856
The only way Da Silva
sails off into retirement

38:14.890 --> 38:16.585
is if the boss dies.

38:16.620 --> 38:18.383
That file is unusable

38:18.430 --> 38:20.421
as a nuclear arsenal.

38:20.460 --> 38:22.325
He kept it solely
to remind Pardillo

38:22.360 --> 38:24.590
of their mutually-assured
destruction.

38:24.630 --> 38:26.666
Well, it won't be much use
to a DA, either.

38:26.700 --> 38:28.463
I stole it from his office.

38:28.500 --> 38:31.401
_ It would be inadmissible
in any case against Da Silva.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.499
He might not go to jail, but
he certainly won't keep his job.

38:33.540 --> 38:35.076
Neither would
the detective.

38:35.110 --> 38:36.532
Fortunately, I don't think

38:36.580 --> 38:39.401
that level of self-sacrifice
Will be necessary.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.577
All right, thanks.

38:43.620 --> 38:44.939
Uh, Commissioner?

38:44.990 --> 38:46.946
Thought you'd
want to hear this.

38:46.990 --> 38:50.517
The lab was able to link the car
bomb that killed Dante Scalice

38:50.560 --> 38:53.882
to explosives from one of Robert
Pardillo's construction offices.

38:53.930 --> 38:56.353
Apparently, they went and
pulled the security tapes.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.425
They got the old man
giving the nod himself.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.563
Is that right?
Captain Gregson said

39:00.600 --> 39:02.033
he's gonna hold off
on the warrant

39:02.070 --> 39:03.799
till they know
Pardillo's whereabouts,

39:03.840 --> 39:06.400
but with a little luck, should
be wrapped up by end of day.

39:06.440 --> 39:11.377
Well, that's a damn fine
collar for Tommy Gregson.

39:11.410 --> 39:13.002
You tell him I said so.

39:13.050 --> 39:15.678
All right.

39:18.020 --> 39:21.786
(phone ringing)

39:21.820 --> 39:23.981
DA SILVA:
Robert?
You're late.

39:24.020 --> 39:25.681
I'm on my way.

39:25.730 --> 39:27.425
What the hell is the matter
with you?

39:27.460 --> 39:29.155
I shouldn't even be showing
my face here.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.553
DA SILVA:
There's a nice Barolo

39:30.600 --> 39:32.124
down in the galley.
Go help yourself.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.832
Be there in 15.

39:34.870 --> 39:37.566
PARDILLO:
I don't think you understand
the spot that I'm in.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.409
Yeah, I know.

39:39.440 --> 39:41.738
You got problems.
You got problems.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.499
But we gotta get
on the same page,

39:44.550 --> 39:46.472
how we're handling Martinez.

39:46.510 --> 39:48.842
Bobby, I wouldn't
have asked you here

39:48.880 --> 39:51.542
if it wasn't serious, huh?

39:51.590 --> 39:52.739
Something you got to see.

39:52.790 --> 39:54.451
Won't take five minutes.

39:54.490 --> 39:56.151
BELL (over bullhorn):
Commissioner Da Silva,

39:56.190 --> 39:58.556
put down your weapon.
You're surrounded.

39:59.790 --> 40:01.599
(siren wailing)
Police! Don't move!

40:01.630 --> 40:03.450
Stay right there!
Do not move!

40:03.500 --> 40:04.694
Let me see your hands!

40:04.730 --> 40:06.425
(siren whoops)

40:06.470 --> 40:07.425
OFFICER:
Clear the boat!

40:07.470 --> 40:09.028
Robert Pardillo...

40:09.070 --> 40:11.061
come out with your hands
behind your head.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.000
(sirens wailing)
It's safe.

40:13.040 --> 40:15.429
We're not gonna let the
deputy commissioner hurt you.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.675
OFFICER:
All right, lock it down! Go!

40:17.710 --> 40:19.575
(siren whoops)
Move! Move!

40:21.550 --> 40:23.438
A silencer.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.584
You were gonna take me
on a boat ride?

40:25.620 --> 40:26.609
You son of a bitch!

40:26.650 --> 40:29.187
(grunting)
Come over here,

40:29.220 --> 40:31.051
you rat bastard!

40:31.090 --> 40:33.479
(sirens approaching)

40:35.530 --> 40:40.820
(sirens continue,
getting closer)

40:44.840 --> 40:47.729
"We're not gonna let him
hurt you" was a nice touch.

40:47.770 --> 40:50.637
(laughs quietly)

40:50.680 --> 40:53.501
(indistinct radio communication
in distance)

40:53.550 --> 40:54.812
No kidding.

40:54.850 --> 40:56.613
(laughs)

40:56.650 --> 40:58.845
I bet he did.

41:00.190 --> 41:01.953
And-and thank you, sir.

41:01.990 --> 41:04.254
All right. Bye.

41:04.290 --> 41:06.053
You're allowed a television

41:06.090 --> 41:08.490
in your room
at Beacon Correctional, correct?

41:08.530 --> 41:10.020
You could hear all that?

41:10.060 --> 41:11.493
I couldn't.

41:11.530 --> 41:12.861
The deposed deputy
commissioner is going

41:12.900 --> 41:14.731
to a minimum security
facility upstate

41:14.770 --> 41:16.567
for the remainder
of his natural-born life.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.602
He struck a deal.

41:18.640 --> 41:21.200
You testify against Robert
Pardillo and his entire family,

41:21.240 --> 41:23.504
you get basic cable.

41:23.540 --> 41:24.973
I would have thought
bread and water would suffice.

41:25.010 --> 41:26.500
Well, he's never gonna
have a good night's

41:26.550 --> 41:27.801
sleep again.
That's for sure.

41:27.850 --> 41:29.977
Department's gonna take
a black eye on this one.

41:30.020 --> 41:31.510
(groans)

41:31.550 --> 41:33.984
Small price to pay
for cutting out a cancer, no?

41:34.020 --> 41:35.681
GREGSON:
While you're here,

41:35.720 --> 41:37.187
I wanted to thank you

41:37.220 --> 41:39.529
for straightening everything
out with Marcus.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.949
It's good to
have him back.
What?

41:51.140 --> 41:52.835
They're good-looking kids, man.

41:52.870 --> 41:54.838
Yeah, they're
gonna love you.

41:54.880 --> 41:58.543
The crazy guy at Dad's office
who bankrolled their new bikes.

41:58.580 --> 42:00.002
For a desk.

42:00.050 --> 42:01.870
Well, you sold low.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.672
I would've went
twice as high.

42:03.720 --> 42:05.585
You're an odd one, Bell.

42:05.620 --> 42:07.986
Don't know what
to tell you, man.

42:08.020 --> 42:10.011
It's my desk.

42:12.130 --> 42:14.724
