JENNIFER: What happened to me?

00:08.958 --> 00:13.541
BANNER: I'm sorry. I tried to warn you.
My blood got into your system.

00:13.625 --> 00:17.416
JENNIFER: So I turn into a Hulk now too.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.583
(GROWLS)

00:18.708 --> 00:19.875
Who the hell are you?

00:19.958 --> 00:23.000
-She-Hulk! She-Hulk! She-Hulk!
-HOLLIWAY: Ms Walters?

00:23.083 --> 00:26.083
We just started a Superhuman Law Division,

00:26.166 --> 00:28.958
and I want the She-Hulk
to be the face of it.

00:29.041 --> 00:31.583
I can't wait to take on whatever case
you assign me...

00:31.666 --> 00:36.041
Your first case is the parole of
Emil Blonsky. Also known as Abomination.

00:36.125 --> 00:37.333
EMIL: Jennifer Walters.

00:37.416 --> 00:42.125
I've already got a winning strategy,
and it is 100% in the bag.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.666
You might wanna
take a look at the news right now.

00:44.750 --> 00:47.416
After shocking footage leaked
showing the Abomination

00:47.500 --> 00:50.875
participating in what appears to be
an underground fight club,

00:50.958 --> 00:52.750
after having escaped from prison.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.875
Do you wanna explain to me
why you failed to mention

01:43.958 --> 01:47.625
that you not only escaped from prison,
but you were also recorded doing so?

01:47.708 --> 01:50.708
You said to my face that you never
turn into the Abomination anymore.

01:50.791 --> 01:53.458
No, I said I choose not to.

01:53.541 --> 01:56.875
You know, these were
extenuating circumstances.

01:56.958 --> 01:59.625
You understand that
this constitutes another crime

01:59.708 --> 02:01.666
and totally destroys
your chances at parole?

02:02.583 --> 02:03.583
What?

02:03.666 --> 02:08.083
Nah, 'cause I was forced to leave my cell,

02:08.166 --> 02:11.708
but I returned of my own free will.

02:11.791 --> 02:16.208
Who forced you to escape this
insanely high-security prison undetected?

02:16.291 --> 02:21.375
A Sorcerer Supreme of the Mystic Arts,
and his name is...

02:21.458 --> 02:24.041
Wong. Just Wong.

02:24.125 --> 02:26.625
And his Internet presence
is a little chaotic.

02:26.708 --> 02:29.916
He's either a sorcerer
who lives in New York,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.083
or a librarian who lives in Nepal.

02:32.166 --> 02:33.500
Can you get to him?

02:33.583 --> 02:35.875
Yes, Jen. It's me.
Of course I can get to him.

02:35.958 --> 02:38.750
I sent a thirst trap. It was a picture
of me with a bunch of books.

02:38.833 --> 02:40.708
Yeah, well, let's just hope he calls back.

02:40.791 --> 02:42.250
If Blonsky's telling the truth,

02:42.333 --> 02:46.333
this guy busted him out of his prison cell
and probably ruined my entire case.

02:47.458 --> 02:50.375
I know you can't wait to see Wong.
I get it.

02:50.458 --> 02:52.166
I wanna make sure that you don't think

02:52.250 --> 02:55.541
this is one of those cameo every week
type of shows. It's not.

02:56.541 --> 02:57.791
Well, except Bruce.

02:58.291 --> 03:00.583
And Blonsky. And Wong.

03:02.208 --> 03:04.416
Just remember whose show this actually is.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.750
(NEWS THEME PLAYING)

03:10.833 --> 03:13.708
Attorney Jennifer Walters
of law firm GLK and H

03:13.791 --> 03:18.416
has been tapped to represent Emil Blonsky,
also known as the Abomination,

03:18.500 --> 03:20.458
in his upcoming parole hearing.

03:20.541 --> 03:22.291
The news has stirred up much controversy.

03:22.375 --> 03:23.875
Ever since it's been revealed that

03:23.958 --> 03:27.666
Jennifer Walters has
a superhero alter-ego called She-Hulk,

03:27.750 --> 03:31.625
the statuesque green lawyer
has been plagued by public backlash,

03:31.708 --> 03:34.166
with many questioning her qualifications.

03:34.333 --> 03:41.333
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

03:42.500 --> 03:46.958
They took the Hulk's manhood away,
but then they gave it to a woman?

03:47.666 --> 03:50.666
MAN 2: I don't get it. Why are you turning
every superhero into a girl?

03:50.750 --> 03:53.625
MAN 3: So we have a MeToo movement,
and now all the male heroes are gone?

03:53.708 --> 03:56.625
I have no problem with female heroes.
Just saying make your own.

03:56.708 --> 03:58.458
I don't know about y'all, but I'd smash.

03:58.541 --> 04:01.458
We have Gideon Wilson, the prosecutor

04:01.541 --> 04:04.333
who put the Abomination away
all those years ago. Gideon.

04:04.416 --> 04:07.000
First, I would like to say,
it is frankly appalling that

04:07.083 --> 04:09.833
anyone would work towards
freeing a monster like the...

04:10.583 --> 04:14.083
-Have you seen this insanity?
-I don't care what anybody says about me.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.416
There's something in this country
called due process.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.791
-Emil deserves a fair hearing.
-You have to respond.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.375
You have to be
in control of your own narrative.

04:22.375 --> 04:23.791
Jennifer Walters speaking.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.708
Yes, I will be right there.

04:28.208 --> 04:29.500
Holliway beckons.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.166
(SIGHS) Come on. This case is huge.

04:32.250 --> 04:35.083
People wanna know
every single detail about your life.

04:35.166 --> 04:36.291
You're a public figure now.

04:36.375 --> 04:39.333
The office has been flooded with
calls and requests for interviews,

04:39.416 --> 04:40.541
so you should do one.

04:40.625 --> 04:42.958
People only care
because I'm representing Emil Blonsky.

04:43.041 --> 04:45.625
Once that's over,
this whole media circus will die down.

04:45.708 --> 04:49.750
No, Jen, this is not gonna go away
just because you're ignoring it.

04:49.833 --> 04:51.541
Every minute I spend on this crap

04:51.625 --> 04:53.958
is one less minute
I spend focusing on my job.

04:54.416 --> 04:58.000
DENNIS: This is absolutely ridiculous.
I am incredibly upset.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.958

doesn't have any Red Bulls?

05:03.375 --> 05:05.875
-Dennis.
-No way... Not Jen Walters.

05:05.958 --> 05:09.833
Ms. Walters is head
of the Superhuman Law Division.

05:09.916 --> 05:12.916
We have too much history for me to be
comfortable with her on the case.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.916
I would love to know what this is about
and not work on it.

05:16.833 --> 05:18.416
-You wanted to see me?
-Ah, yes.

05:18.500 --> 05:22.083
Mallory Book is also
in the Superhuman Law Division.

05:22.166 --> 05:26.250
Yeah. No, I can't talk to a 10
about embarrassing man stuff.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.958
She could be my next fiancÃ©e.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.291
Happy to not be involved.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.375
Is he a lawyer?
He looks cool. I'll take him.

05:35.250 --> 05:39.750
Well, our friend,
Mr. Bukowski from the DA's office,

05:39.833 --> 05:43.916
needs help on a delicate matter.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.833
He's been defrauded by an ex-girlfriend

05:45.916 --> 05:49.250
and wants to file a suit against her
to get his money back.

05:49.333 --> 05:52.291
Yeah. I bought her jewelry,
flew her to Bali for a photo-shoot,

05:52.375 --> 05:54.458
paid off her Volkswagen Passat.
Subscribed to...

05:54.541 --> 05:56.166
But why the Superhuman Law Division?

05:56.250 --> 06:00.208
The girlfriend in question is
a shapeshifting Light Elf from New Asgard.

06:00.291 --> 06:01.416
Wow, Dennis.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.333
Okay. Well, to be fair, I thought
I was dating Megan Thee Stallion.

06:04.416 --> 06:05.416
I'm sorry. What?

06:05.500 --> 06:08.541
Sorry. You thought you were
dating Megan Thee Stallion?

06:09.166 --> 06:12.416
Multiple Grammy award-winner megastar
Megan Thee Stallion?

06:12.500 --> 06:14.583
What part of "shapeshifter"
did you not get?

06:14.666 --> 06:15.833
(CHUCKLES)

06:15.916 --> 06:19.125
-You thought she drove a Passat?
-This is why I don't want Walters.

06:19.208 --> 06:20.833
(CHUCKLES) I'm so sorry.

06:21.625 --> 06:22.833
(WHOOSHING)

06:24.083 --> 06:26.458
Ms. Walters, I received your message.

06:26.541 --> 06:29.916
Uh, Mr. Wong. Great entrance.
Perfect timing.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.500
-I really need to take this.
-You may go.

06:32.583 --> 06:35.625
Thank you. Uh, Pug, good luck.

06:35.708 --> 06:36.791
Dennis...

06:36.875 --> 06:38.750
(LAUGHS)

06:38.833 --> 06:39.958
Sorry.

06:40.458 --> 06:42.666
Everything Mr. Blonsky told you
is factual.

06:42.750 --> 06:46.041
I extracted him from the prison
against his own wishes,

06:46.125 --> 06:48.083
because I required a worthy opponent

06:48.166 --> 06:50.583
as part of my training
to become Sorcerer Supreme.

06:50.666 --> 06:54.458
And as Sorcerer Supreme, I insist that
he not be punished for my actions.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.875
Again, I am not the one
who will be punishing him.

06:57.958 --> 07:00.708
The parole board will not release him
after seeing this video.

07:00.791 --> 07:04.916
I know what you're thinking, Ms. Walters,
and I'm not erasing everyone's memories.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Not again.

07:06.083 --> 07:08.291
That is not what I was thinking.
That is highly unethical.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.708
Yeah, it's also very messy, believe me.

07:10.791 --> 07:13.166
-Okay.
-We'll send him to the Mirror Dimension.

07:13.250 --> 07:15.375
-Don't know what that is, but no.
-Shadow Dimension?

07:16.541 --> 07:20.000
What you can do to help is show up
at the hearing and explain everything.

07:20.083 --> 07:23.541
Very well.
We'll reserve sorcery for strategy B.

PUG: So, Mr. Bukowski,
how much money in cash and gifts

07:29.625 --> 07:32.541
did you spend on
the Megan Thee Stallion imposter?

07:32.958 --> 07:34.541
Oh, man. (GROANS)

07:35.041 --> 07:39.500
How about I just say a number,
and you tell me higher or lower, okay?

07:39.583 --> 07:44.125
Considering that you bought her
a mid-sized sedan, how about $50,000?

07:45.583 --> 07:46.750
100?

07:47.291 --> 07:52.208
-200?
-(CHUCKLES) $200,000? I am not a fool.

07:53.250 --> 07:57.333
-No, it was more like 175.
-100... $175,000?

07:58.166 --> 08:00.541
That's a house
in parts of the country, Mr. Bukowski.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.083
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, right.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.541
So, are you gonna help me or not?

08:05.625 --> 08:08.875
I'm gonna start building your case,
and I will be in touch, Mr. Bukowski.

08:10.583 --> 08:11.666
All right.

08:17.708 --> 08:18.750
Okay.

08:32.458 --> 08:34.958

I'm gonna drop the case.

08:35.041 --> 08:36.458
Wait. What? Just now? You just...

08:36.541 --> 08:41.541
The truth is, I think somewhere
deep inside, I knew. You know?

08:41.625 --> 08:43.291
I gave those things 'cause I wanted to.

08:43.375 --> 08:47.458
I was just embarrassed
to get found out in such a public way.

08:48.083 --> 08:50.833
But at some point in time,
you gotta take personal responsibility.

08:50.916 --> 08:54.875
-I have to say, this is unexpected.
-Well, it's just money after all.

08:56.208 --> 08:59.833

outside the ultra-high security prison

where the man known as the Abomination
will appear before a parole board.

09:46.291 --> 09:49.250
There is much public furor
over the possible release of...

09:49.333 --> 09:51.583
Wait. Is that her?
She-Hulk, can we get a word?

09:51.666 --> 09:54.000
Is it true you were

That was Jennifer Walters,
also known as She-Hulk,

rumored to have been
rejected by the Avengers.

-Okay.

10:16.458 --> 10:17.458
Is Wong about?

10:17.541 --> 10:21.333
No. I don't understand how
a guy with zero commute time is late.

10:21.416 --> 10:24.916
We are here today to determine
whether Emil Blonsky is

10:25.541 --> 10:29.541
suitable for return to society
after having served his minimum sentence.

10:29.916 --> 10:32.458
In light of recent evidence
of a prison escape,

10:32.541 --> 10:35.458
I think we all know how this is gonna go.
So, let's keep this brief.

10:35.541 --> 10:39.875
As Mr. Blonsky's counsel, I would love to
address the alleged prison escape.

10:39.958 --> 10:41.416
We do have a witness

10:41.500 --> 10:45.041
who is able to clear Mr. Blonsky
of any wrongdoing on his part.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.666
Then we'll start with that then.

10:47.333 --> 10:51.958
Well, yes, the witness is prepared
to give a statement

10:52.791 --> 10:54.458
after Mr. Blonsky gives his.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.583
MAN: Are we really entertaining
the idea of releasing

10:57.666 --> 11:00.166
someone who's been documented
escaping from prison?

11:00.250 --> 11:04.708
Now hold on. Mr. Blonsky,
do you feel you have been rehabilitated?

11:04.791 --> 11:06.125
Uh...

11:09.416 --> 11:14.375
Let's start by saying
that I feel great remorse,

11:14.791 --> 11:17.875
great shame to those that I've harmed.

11:18.416 --> 11:21.958
So, to answer your question,
yes, I feel I have been rehabilitated.

11:22.708 --> 11:28.166
I've spent every day of my incarceration
focused solely on redemption.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.166
I have changed.

11:30.791 --> 11:34.125
Emotionally, physically,
metaphysically, spiritually,

11:34.208 --> 11:36.916
karmically, cosmically,
inter-dimensionally...

11:37.000 --> 11:38.333
Et cetera.

11:38.416 --> 11:42.208
What Mr. Blonsky is trying to say
is that the man you see before you

11:42.291 --> 11:44.958
is not the same Emil Blonsky as before.

11:45.041 --> 11:48.166
All he wants now
is to be a contributing member of society.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.166
If released,
would you have a place to live?

11:51.250 --> 11:53.375
Yeah. You can rely on that.

11:54.583 --> 11:58.958
Mr. Blonsky does own a plot of land
on which he plans to work and reside.

11:59.666 --> 12:01.083
He's going into farming?

12:01.166 --> 12:05.791
No. Actually, he plans to open
a meditation retreat on the property.

12:05.875 --> 12:08.291
So, just very... Well, you know...

12:08.375 --> 12:13.000
And how does Mr. Blonsky
intend to fund this endeavor?

12:14.416 --> 12:16.500
Mr. Blonsky is currently

12:16.583 --> 12:20.250
in a long-term committed relationship
with several pen pals.

12:20.333 --> 12:23.708
All of whom have pledged
to financially support him.

12:23.791 --> 12:25.375
Excuse me. If I could...

12:25.458 --> 12:27.833
-May I clarify? Yeah.
-No.

12:27.916 --> 12:33.875
Blair, Ruth, Marta, Sheila, Alejandra,
Yvonne and Nicolette are my soulmates.

12:34.333 --> 12:37.583
We met through the prison pen pal program.

12:37.666 --> 12:40.291
They are my better eighths.

12:42.541 --> 12:44.666
(CLICKS TONGUE) Love you.

12:46.791 --> 12:50.083
I don't think we need to get into that
any further. Any other questions?

12:52.708 --> 12:55.000
Blonsky started the prison's
literacy program.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.333
He's helped countless prisoners
learn how to read.

12:57.416 --> 13:00.625
He leads guided meditation
and yoga for the prisoners.

13:02.541 --> 13:06.041
-(SOBS) He saved me from a bad marriage.
-That's it, Carl. Let it flow.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.791
Now the library is more than
just a quiet place to shiv someone.

13:08.875 --> 13:12.875
Instead of toilet wine,
prisoners make toilet kombucha.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.208
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

13:15.291 --> 13:17.708
-I release you, Linda.
-Proud of you, Carl.

13:17.791 --> 13:21.125
-I love you so much.
-Yeah, okay, we're done with Carl.

13:21.208 --> 13:23.333
(CARL SOBS)

13:23.416 --> 13:27.625
Is that all? Because there's still
the matter of Mr. Blonsky's escape.

(ABOMINATION ROARS ON VIDEO)

13:34.083 --> 13:35.083

13:35.583 --> 13:41.375
Yes, there were extenuating circumstances
that the witness will explain.

13:42.291 --> 13:44.041
(SOFTLY) If he ever decides to show up.

13:47.875 --> 13:50.000
My apologies, Ms. Walters and Emil.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.916
-Ah! Finally.
-I lost track of time.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.166
I've asked Wong here today

13:55.250 --> 13:59.125
because he is the man responsible
for Emil Blonsky leaving prison.

13:59.208 --> 14:02.791
And I do think you will see this
whole thing in a totally different light

14:03.125 --> 14:04.208
after hearing from him.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.333
Have you ever heard of a kumite?

14:10.416 --> 14:11.583
Mmm-mmm.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.833
I'd like to move for dismissal
of all charges against my client.

14:15.916 --> 14:17.000
On what grounds?

14:17.083 --> 14:21.125
Runa is the daughter of an Elfin diplomat
on Asgard and now in New Asgard.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.958
-Did you know about this?
-As such, she has diplomatic immunity.

14:24.041 --> 14:28.458
She may have diplomatic immunity in
New Asgard, but we are not in New Asgard.

14:28.541 --> 14:30.208
Excuse me, Your Honor,

14:30.291 --> 14:35.041
but Asgard is not a place, it is a people.
Therefore, I...

14:35.125 --> 14:38.333
Thor's inspirational speeches
are not admissible in court.

14:39.166 --> 14:41.041
Your Honor, this case is very cut and dry.

14:41.125 --> 14:45.750
My client was defrauded of $175,000
by a scam artist.

14:46.208 --> 14:47.458
He deserves compensation

14:47.541 --> 14:49.958
for the financial and emotional trauma
that he's suffered.

14:50.041 --> 14:53.125
My client and Mr. Bukowski
were in a consensual relationship

14:53.208 --> 14:55.375
-and engaged in role-play.
-Oh, gross.

14:55.458 --> 14:58.208
No rational adult would have
believed my client's texts

14:58.291 --> 15:00.333
-were from the real Megan Thee Stallion.
-(SCOFFS)

15:00.416 --> 15:02.583
Mr. Bukowski knew he was dating Miss Runa

15:02.666 --> 15:04.958
and went along with it
until it no longer suited him.

15:05.041 --> 15:06.041
I did not.

15:06.125 --> 15:08.958
This was a relationship gone bad,
not a scam.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.500
Mr. Bukowski was blinded by love.

15:11.583 --> 15:15.541
He absolutely believed that he was dating
the real Megan Thee Stallion.

15:15.625 --> 15:20.458
I must say, I find it hard to believe that
Mr. Bukowski could be fooled so easily.

15:20.541 --> 15:23.250
And the onus is on you
to prove that, Mr. Pugliese.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.958
That being said,
I'll allow this to go to trial.

15:26.041 --> 15:29.291

your motion to dismiss is denied.

(CHUCKLES)

15:51.041 --> 15:53.375
Come on, Runa.
This is getting a little broad.

15:54.583 --> 15:57.916

This is very good for us.

16:06.250 --> 16:07.250
Yuck.

16:07.333 --> 16:11.083
In regard to Mr. Blonsky
vacating his cell, I gave him no choice.

16:11.958 --> 16:14.791
But it was absolutely
his choice to return.

16:16.166 --> 16:20.541
I offered him asylum at the Kamar-Taj,
which is lovely this time of the year.

16:21.208 --> 16:23.416
But he was quite adamant he be returned

16:23.500 --> 16:27.416
to serve out his sentence
and repay his debt to society.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.291
Thank you.

16:32.416 --> 16:37.708
So you see, Emil Blonsky was forced
out of his cell against his will.

16:38.125 --> 16:42.291
And even when offered instant freedom,
he chose to return to his cell.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.583
These are not the actions of a criminal

16:44.666 --> 16:48.291
but of a reformed man
who truly wants to do the right thing.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.916
Well, that may be true of Emil Blonsky,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.875

uncontrollably becomes Abomination,

Ladies and gentlemen, I beg you to forgive
Mr. Blonsky's enthusiasm.

18:01.708 --> 18:05.333
He didn't intend to frighten anyone.

18:06.666 --> 18:10.583
In fact, this proves
that in every instance,

18:10.666 --> 18:17.000
Mr. Blonsky could have broken free
but has chosen to remain in his cell.

18:17.083 --> 18:23.083
As his stellar prison record reflects,
Mr. Blonsky spent his entire incarceration

18:23.166 --> 18:27.458
practicing a strict regimen
of training and self-discipline

18:27.541 --> 18:30.500
so that he may
walk among his fellow citizens

18:30.583 --> 18:35.583
with no chance of becoming
a rampaging Abomination again.

and a productive citizen.

you've just admitted to facilitating
a prisoner escape, which is a crime.

19:08.166 --> 19:09.208
I must depart.

19:23.416 --> 19:24.583

How do you plan to take Blonsky down
when he rampages again?

What about claims that
you're one of Blonsky's rumored soulmates?

19:31.833 --> 19:34.000
Is there any truth to the rumors

-from a Mafia hit gone wrong?
-What?

undoubtedly hoping to avoid the protesters

19:41.041 --> 19:43.041
that are gathered
just outside the gates here.

19:43.125 --> 19:46.500
And then I get to my car,
and some protester has written on it,

20:26.625 --> 20:29.583
Oh, I killed him in my head several times,
in many different ways.

20:29.666 --> 20:32.041
And yet he was convinced
that she had a crush on him.

20:32.125 --> 20:35.333
-The man is almost terminally deluded.
-I'd call him gross.

20:37.166 --> 20:39.458

to say that under oath?

20:40.625 --> 20:42.541
I swear the testimony

20:42.625 --> 20:45.041
is the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

Jen is gonna help us clinch this.
Trust me.

20:52.958 --> 20:56.416
Ms. Walters, how would you describe
your relationship to Mr. Bukowski?

20:56.500 --> 20:59.541
We worked together for several years
at the DA's office.

20:59.625 --> 21:02.375
Would you say that
you know Mr. Bukowski fairly well?

21:02.833 --> 21:05.916
Definitely. We worked regularly
on cases together,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.916
so I've spent a lot of time
with Mr. Bukowski.

21:10.291 --> 21:13.916
Did he ever share his personal life
with you? Specifically, his dating life.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.916
Yes, he would,
prolifically and unprompted.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.208
You wanted to know.

21:19.250 --> 21:23.708
How would you characterize Mr. Bukowski
in relation to his romantic life?

21:25.208 --> 21:28.791
Self-absorbed, chauvinistic, conceited.

21:28.875 --> 21:33.583
He once described himself
as a New York 10 and an LA 11.

21:33.666 --> 21:35.041
(LAUGHS)

21:35.500 --> 21:38.208
He nicknamed his office the Dennisphere...

21:38.291 --> 21:40.166
Objection. Relevance.

21:40.250 --> 21:44.666
Mr. Bukowski, need I remind you that
you're not representing yourself here?

21:45.125 --> 21:46.750
And this is your witness.

21:46.833 --> 21:50.375
But I agree.
Mr. Pugliese, get to your point.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.958
It's been stated many times
in this courtroom

21:53.041 --> 21:55.041
that a man of reasonable intelligence

21:55.125 --> 21:58.291
would never think that he was
dating the real Megan Thee Stallion.

21:58.708 --> 22:03.250
In your opinion, Ms. Walters, do you think
that Dennis Bukowski would believe

22:03.333 --> 22:07.125
that he could actually pull
Megan Thee Stallion?

22:07.208 --> 22:12.333
Yes. Dennis Bukowski is
an almost pathologically entitled man.

22:12.416 --> 22:15.708
He would absolutely believe that
he's dating the real Megan Thee Stallion

22:15.791 --> 22:17.875
because he is truly that delusional.

22:18.583 --> 22:20.208
No further questions, Your Honor.

22:27.083 --> 22:32.166
In the case of Bukowski v. Runa,
I award full damages to Dennis Bukowski

22:32.250 --> 22:36.041
in the amount of $175,000.

22:36.125 --> 22:37.250
In addition,

22:37.333 --> 22:43.541
we also sentence the defendant to 60 days
for impersonating a judge.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.291
No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:45.791 --> 22:47.791

There's only one Megan Thee Stallion.

Ah!

You guys think I have a shot with
the real Megan Thee Stallion?

22:54.500 --> 22:55.500
Should I go back?

22:55.583 --> 22:58.625
No. No. Please, don't do that.
Thanks for that testimony in there, Jen.

22:58.708 --> 22:59.750
It was my pleasure.

22:59.833 --> 23:02.458
The sad part is that elf's just gonna
get a slap on the wrist.

23:02.541 --> 23:04.666
I wish there was a way
we could remove her powers

23:04.750 --> 23:07.041
and make sure
she doesn't victimize anyone else.

23:07.125 --> 23:10.291
Oh! Did Dennis Bukowski
just give me an idea?

Here with us in the studio, the lawyer
responsible for his release, She-Hulk.

24:31.458 --> 24:34.166
Yeah, my name is Jennifer Walters,
not She-Hulk,

24:34.250 --> 24:38.166
and my client's name is Emil Blonsky,
not the Abomination.

24:38.875 --> 24:39.875

The high-profile nature of this case
and the fact that you yourself are a Hulk

has catapulted you into the public eye.

24:47.166 --> 24:50.000
So, tell us, how did you come up
with the name She-Hulk?

24:50.083 --> 24:52.916
Oh! Funny story, I didn't.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.708
Some random guy on the news
came up with it

24:55.791 --> 25:00.083
after thinking about it for,
like, two seconds, but it stuck.

25:00.416 --> 25:04.916
So, now whether I like it or not,
I am forever She-Hulk.

Great. We have to take a break.

you better be able to back it up.

an Asgardian construction worker?

No. Once she turned into She-Hulk,
I couldn't pierce that nasty green skin.
