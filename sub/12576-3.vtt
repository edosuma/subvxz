WEBVTT

00:39.456 --> 00:44.794
Gentlemen, the John Deere 518r
walk-behind tiller.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.004
Look at it, son.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.424
Five horsepower briggs and stratton engine

00:49.424 --> 00:54.095
16 heat-resistant tines,
13-inch super lug tires

00:54.179 --> 00:56.181
and if I'm not mistaken,

00:56.181 --> 00:58.808
this model comes with a hat.

00:58.892 --> 00:59.934
Can I have it?

01:04.272 --> 01:06.524
You know, Bobby should see this, too.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.567
Hey, Bobby!

01:08.318 --> 01:11.738
Now, Bobby, there is a lot
you can learn from PBS

01:11.738 --> 01:13.823
thanks to the support of viewers like me.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.659
Bobby, come meet our new rototiller.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.205
Later, Hank. This is educational TV time.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.958
What we're about to see is British comedy.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.919
You may not understand all of it at first

01:25.919 --> 01:28.713
because it's more sophisticated
than what we're used to.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.800
That man is wearing a dress.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.343
Exactly.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.678
Well, I can't wait any longer.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.639
Bobby's just going to
have to watch the tape.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.350
- Ooh. Look at that.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.855
- Uh-oh.
- What the... Ah!

01:46.397 --> 01:47.816
MAN 1 (on TV): <i>Oh, posh.</i>

01:47.816 --> 01:50.235
<i>I've a run in my stocking.</i>

01:50.235 --> 01:51.694
MAN 2 (on TV): <i>Yes, prime minister.</i>

01:54.322 --> 01:55.865
Made in America

01:55.949 --> 01:58.034
cannot just be a marketing gimmick.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.327
Like dolphin safe.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.204
It's got to stand for something.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.288
What's wrong, Dad?

02:02.372 --> 02:05.625
Well, this dang rock
busted up my rototiller.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.086
A rock? That is no rock.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.631
This is an arrowhead. An Indian arrowhead.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.049
I led a field trip once

02:13.133 --> 02:14.926
to the museum of Texas Cultures.

02:14.926 --> 02:18.012
A little girl swallowed one
just like this by mistake.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.556
She thought it was a rock, too.

02:19.556 --> 02:23.017
We learned in school,
you don't call them Indians anymore.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.395
You call them Native Americans.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.356
It's like saying same-sex
partner instead of...

02:28.356 --> 02:29.524
- HANK, PEGGY: Bobby!

02:43.663 --> 02:44.539
Cool, Dad.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.498
What is that?

02:45.832 --> 02:47.125
Some old Indian thing.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.918
What's it for?

02:49.002 --> 02:53.423
Well, I don't know much about Indians,
but I do know tools,

02:53.423 --> 02:56.217
and if I had to guess,
I'd say you jam one of these

02:56.301 --> 02:58.761
in the back of a white man's skull,

02:58.845 --> 03:00.430
twist the handle like so,

03:00.430 --> 03:02.807
and then your blood runs out
through the hole here.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.105
Yep, that's what it's for.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.692
I thought the tribes that used to live
around here were peaceful.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.611
Well, I'm going to get
to the bottom of this.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.030
I'd hate to use a tool improperly.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.789
Uh... Hi, Nancy.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.958
Oh, uh, sorry, sug.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.251
Dale's at work.

03:30.335 --> 03:31.920
Huh... Yeah.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.590
Uh... Yeah, I'm not looking for Dale. Uh,

03:36.549 --> 03:38.968
I'm looking for John Redcorn.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.063
John Redcorn, it's for you.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.698
Hank. Nancy has a therapeutic
massage today...

04:01.616 --> 04:02.825
for her migraines.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.913
Listen, I found this Indian, uh...

04:07.872 --> 04:09.832
Native Indian thing in my yard

04:10.333 --> 04:12.377
and I was wondering
if you knew what it was.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.921
It's a tool used
for straightening the shaft of an arrow.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.589
Uh-huh. In a pinch, though,

04:16.673 --> 04:19.259
you could jam it into
someone's brain stem, right?

04:20.301 --> 04:22.387
Yes, but that's true of almost any tool.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.347
Well, yeah, sure, I guess.

04:24.847 --> 04:27.600
A treasure such as this
is priceless to my people.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.562
Really? What do you suppose
it's worth to my people?

04:32.563 --> 04:35.608
A museum or university might
give you fifty dollars.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.235
Fifty dollars, huh?

04:38.152 --> 04:40.488
Well, that'd get me
a new rototiller blade.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.699
Hank, think about what you're doing.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.785
It is wrong to take what belongs
to another person and...

04:45.785 --> 04:47.120
John redcorn?

04:48.538 --> 04:49.664
Well, food for thought.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.472
Hey, man, sign a petition
to legalize hemp?

05:06.556 --> 05:07.598
What's hemp?

05:07.682 --> 05:10.184
"It's a cheap and durable source of fibers

05:10.268 --> 05:13.187
that can be used
for making clothing, rope, and paper."

05:13.688 --> 05:15.773
Typical government over-regulation.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.817
Why wouldn't they legalize this stuff?

05:17.817 --> 05:19.819
Well, because, you know, it's...

05:19.819 --> 05:22.989
Basically... Marijuana?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.784
The volcano erupted so suddenly

05:26.993 --> 05:28.411
that the village and everyone in it

05:28.411 --> 05:29.996
were instantly encased in lava

05:29.996 --> 05:32.206
creating a snapshot,
if you will, of daily life

05:32.290 --> 05:33.750
at that exact moment

05:33.750 --> 05:34.959
and when we archaeologists

05:35.043 --> 05:36.753
go and develop that snapshot

05:36.753 --> 05:38.588
believe me, no one is smiling.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.175
- See you tomorrow.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.680
That's right, they're breasts.

05:47.764 --> 05:48.931
Big deal.

05:50.641 --> 05:53.436
Uh. Excuse me, professor. I'm Hank Hill.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.230
I left a message on your voice mail.
I don't know if you got it.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.858
- It said to press pound but I...
- The artifact guy, yeah.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.151
You don't have to hit pound.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.069
So...

06:01.069 --> 06:03.446
- ...what do you got for me?
- Well, I got this arrowhead

06:03.446 --> 06:05.990
and this here is a shaft-straightener.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.910
So, uh, what do you think they're worth?

06:08.910 --> 06:11.621
Well, the arrowhead, that's worth nothing.
That's garbage.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.623
Here, You want me to throw
it away for you? It's on me.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.750
Uh, how about the other one?

06:16.459 --> 06:18.336
A cad-do tribesman might have traded this

06:18.836 --> 06:20.755
for, say, a new loincloth.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.049
What's a crotch-sized
piece of leather go for these days?

06:23.049 --> 06:24.842
I certainly do not know.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.636
It can't be more than ten dollars, right?

06:26.636 --> 06:28.054
Now, hold on a minute.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.431
An Indian friend of mine
said it was sacred.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.225
Le me explain something to you, Mr. Hill.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.144
To the Native Americans,
everything is sacred,

06:35.228 --> 06:36.145
the sun, the dirt.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.856
Do you want to pay me for the air
you've been breathing since you came in?

06:38.940 --> 06:39.982
That's sacred, too.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.192
Look, I don't want to argue this.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.194
I'll just take the ten dollars.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.279
Count it. It's all there.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.659
- Ah, okay.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.834
You had no right to sell

06:57.834 --> 06:58.918
those artifacts, Hank.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.878
This home belongs to the both of us.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.380
What are you so upset about?

07:02.380 --> 07:04.257
I got ten dollars for some junk

07:04.257 --> 07:06.300
that Bobby would've just
ended up swallowing.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.802
Those objects were cultural.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.054
They could've expanded Bobby's mind,

07:10.513 --> 07:14.517
and I, for one, want my son's brain
to swell up as big as it'll go.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.399
What are you doing?

07:21.399 --> 07:23.860
You're eating fried chicken for breakfast?

07:23.860 --> 07:27.780
Nuh-uh. We're making bones for Bobby's
social studies project.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.199
It's a Native American Necklace

07:30.283 --> 07:31.993
like the tonkawa wore.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.786
I was going to bring in the arrowhead

07:33.870 --> 07:36.414
and get an A and maybe even go to college.

07:36.414 --> 07:39.625
But mom says you sold out
my future for ten dollars.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.544
I hope you're happy.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.213
That's still mom talking.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.012
I am sorry, gentlemen,
but we are not in the market

07:51.012 --> 07:52.054
for a new religion.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.931
Who, me? Oh, no, no, no.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.391
I'm an archaeologist.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.185
Professor John Lerner, PhD.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.936
Oh! Peggy Hill.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.063
You know, I'm a teacher, too.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.773
Substitute Spanish, mm-hmm.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.860
Your husband came to see me
the other day with a cad-do arrowhead.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.447
Well, I am the one who first determined
it was not a rock.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.741
Well, you are a friend to archaeology.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.952
And archaeology can use
all the friends it can get

08:15.036 --> 08:16.621
with the red tape we put up with.

08:16.621 --> 08:20.208
Look at this. Those pieces
your husband found weren't worth much

08:20.208 --> 08:23.127
but who knows, tomorrow, if we poke
around here a little

08:23.211 --> 08:25.379
I might find something
of real cultural value.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.798
Oh, please, be my guest.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.050
No, that's what I'm saying.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.802
They want paperwork,
a homeowner's signature.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.387
Technically, I shouldn't even be here.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.388
Don't be silly.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.431
Give me that.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.894
I thank you, archaeology thanks you

08:39.894 --> 08:42.605
and most of all,
I want you to thank yourself.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.565
Oh, no. I couldn't.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.317
For advancing the cause
of knowledge, Peggy.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.527
Come on now. I wanna hear it.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.654
Well... thank you, Peggy Hill.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.863
You are welcome.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.741
You see, the secret is pretending
they're special.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.743
I probably could have gotten
the title to her house

08:55.910 --> 08:57.495
if I had complimented her stupid glasses.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.540
What was that about?

09:00.540 --> 09:03.417
Nothing. The professor, my friend,
just wanted to know

09:03.501 --> 09:05.920
if he could poke around the lawn
tomorrow for some artifacts.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.505
I, of course, said yes.

09:07.505 --> 09:11.008
How could you do that, Peggy,
without even asking me?

09:11.092 --> 09:14.262
Well, you sold that arrowhead
without asking me.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.097
Fine. We're even.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.975
But I think you owe my lawn an apology.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.061
We're waiting.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.523
Uh, Peggy?

09:28.276 --> 09:29.443
You can't just think it.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.404
You got to say it out loud!

09:34.532 --> 09:35.449
Hank

09:35.533 --> 09:37.952
I thought you told Dale
not to mow at this hour.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.620
What?

09:40.329 --> 09:41.747
That's not Dale's mower.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.208
That's not a mower at all.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.505
No!

09:54.093 --> 09:55.720
No!

10:04.353 --> 10:07.023
"Therefore, after the referred-to
‘dang ol aforementioned antiquities

10:07.607 --> 10:08.774
pursuant to the public domain.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.776
Title nine of the state resource code."

10:11.235 --> 10:12.862
I tell you what, man, it's airtight.

10:12.862 --> 10:16.198
Boomhauer, I didn't understand
a word you just said.

10:17.074 --> 10:18.659
Damn legalese.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.954
I never thought I'd see the day
when my own government would go around

10:22.038 --> 10:23.914
stealing people's land.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.291
Think about it, Hank.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.794
Isn't that what happened to the peoples
who lived here before us?

10:39.347 --> 10:40.765
Whoa! Whoa! What are they doing?

10:40.765 --> 10:42.266
That's my privacy hedge!

10:42.350 --> 10:44.435
- Hi, Uncle Hank.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.686
Mm. I hope you don't mind

10:45.770 --> 10:47.271
but I borrowed your razor.

10:47.772 --> 10:48.773
All right, that's it!

10:48.773 --> 10:50.900
Everybody off my property.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.318
I said off!

10:52.318 --> 10:54.070
Don't make me call the cops!

10:54.070 --> 10:55.196
Go right ahead.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.365
And while you're at it,
tell them you're trespassing

10:57.365 --> 10:59.408
on a protected archaeological site.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.285
What I am about to say

11:01.369 --> 11:03.329
goes against everything I believe,

11:04.080 --> 11:06.832
but you played dirty,
and you leave me with no choice.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.835
You are sued, mister.

11:09.919 --> 11:13.339
You're all witnesses,
and you're all being sued, too.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.341
And you're the witness to that.

11:16.592 --> 11:17.760
Here I want all your names.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.137
And I don't want any Seymour butts

11:20.221 --> 11:21.430
or IP Freelie's.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.391
My wife's a substitute teacher.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.642
I know all the tricks.

11:28.896 --> 11:29.855
What do you think it is?

11:29.939 --> 11:31.315
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.735
Mm. I think it's a clay pot.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.987
- More likely a ceramic bowl.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.156
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You may be right.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.741
Yes. Would you excuse me?

11:45.871 --> 11:48.999
Peggy, you won't believe what that
idiot professor did.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.961
He got dirt all over my compost heap.

11:51.961 --> 11:55.464
Hank, please, Professor Lerner
is no idiot.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.841
In fact, he's a genius.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.176
And that's as far from idiot
as you can get

11:59.260 --> 12:00.720
before reaching madness.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.638
Maybe we should invite
the professor to dinner.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.390
Bobby could learn a lot from him.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.684
Don't turn dinner into school, Peggy.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.937
Dinner's one of the few
things Bobby's good at.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.772
Well, he is good with a fork and knife,

12:11.856 --> 12:12.940
I grant you that.

12:12.940 --> 12:15.401
But it's time for him
to move to the next level,

12:15.860 --> 12:19.113
learning the art of conversation
and drinking without a straw.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.367
I'll never forget when
the king tut exhibit came to my hometown.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.161
I'm standing in that museum

12:25.161 --> 12:27.371
amongst these
priceless artifacts, thinking,

12:28.289 --> 12:29.415
I can do better.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.834
Three years later, I had my first PhD.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.669
From the University of Chicago.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.464
That's one of the finest
schools in the country.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.631
School?

12:37.715 --> 12:39.842
They don't even have a football team.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.427
Oh, so you like football, huh, Bobby?

12:42.178 --> 12:45.347
Did you know that the cad-do Indians
played a game like football?

12:45.598 --> 12:46.891
They called it chunkee

12:46.891 --> 12:49.560
Only they used sticks, darts,
and rolling disks of stone.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.979
Tell me more, professor.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.063
Right, Mom?

12:59.069 --> 13:02.615
Mmm.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.786
Alright, if the cad-do could play chunkee
with a stone disk

13:07.328 --> 13:08.913
why couldn't they invent the wheel?

13:08.913 --> 13:10.289
- Peggy...
- No. Uh-uh.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.541
You cannot just blow my mind and leave.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.918
Sorry, big day tomorrow.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.586
We're digging up your rose bushes.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.670
Oh, how exciting.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.464
Maybe you and Bobby
would like to assist me?

13:18.464 --> 13:20.382
I don't believe it. Our first dig.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.717
I remember my first dig.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.677
The Finis Frost site.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.347
That's where I discovered my first
Wahashaw bracelet.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.015
This is a replica.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.477
The real one is very fragile
and it doesn't go with this sweater.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.562
Oh, it's just beautiful.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.231
A man wearing jewelry.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.440
That's funny.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.483
Like on PBS...

13:37.483 --> 13:38.609
Bobby, shh.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.779
A Wahashaw bracelet is not jewelry.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.113
It's a badge of honor.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.908
A young brave would give one
of these to a girl he liked

13:45.908 --> 13:47.326
as a symbol of their bond.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.661
Wahashaw means connection,

13:50.579 --> 13:51.872
but it can also mean much more.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.209
Huh. Kind of like <i>aloha.</i>

13:55.751 --> 13:58.003
It means hello and goodbye.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.214
- Well. actually, it's more like--
- Well, <i>aloha.</i>

14:00.339 --> 14:01.173
Goodbye.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.470
Before we discuss this ancient
Indian burial ground

14:06.554 --> 14:07.638
I'd like to say two things.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.890
First, thank you to Mrs. Peggy Hill

14:09.974 --> 14:11.642
for organizing this field trip.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.520
Secondly, if a bony hand
reaches out from the soil

14:14.520 --> 14:16.438
and tries to drag you into its grave

14:16.522 --> 14:18.274
- remain calm.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.901
Seriously, remain calm.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.279
Now, who can tell me

14:23.279 --> 14:25.823
what Indian tribes are native to Arlen?

14:25.823 --> 14:26.824
Hmm.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.580
Ah, Mrs. Hill, enlighten us, please.

14:33.455 --> 14:36.041
Well, if I'm not mistaken, and I could be,

14:36.584 --> 14:39.336
the cad-do were the earliest
settlers of this region.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.421
That's exactly right.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.638
<i>A high-pressure system
comin' in can mean lower temperatures...</i>

14:49.722 --> 14:50.806
Where have you been?

14:51.348 --> 14:54.143
You missed action sports
and half of action weather.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.062
Bobby and I have been in the yard all day
digging things up.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.816
Oh, by the way, he knows his cat
didn't run away now.

15:01.483 --> 15:03.027
So, what did I miss?

15:03.027 --> 15:07.239
Another new soccer league,
30 percent chance of rain.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.157
Rain?

15:08.157 --> 15:09.992
Oh, I'd better warn the professor.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.244
He left the top down on his Saab.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.830
I guess I'll just go to bed.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.501
What in god's name?

15:19.585 --> 15:21.921
Stadium lights... like the cowboys use.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.506
Well, now the professor can dig all night
if he wants to.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.759
The cowboys would treasure my lawn,

15:26.759 --> 15:29.345
not turn it into some
kind of a freak show.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.263
Oh, it hasn't been all bad, Hank.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.474
We may have lost a lawn,

15:33.474 --> 15:34.975
but Bobby gained a role model.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.894
I'm his role model.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.563
Not that bracelet-wearing egghead.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.483
I really don't see what you have
against the professor.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.776
I think we all would benefit

15:43.776 --> 15:45.194
from spending more time with him.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.821
Now if you'll excuse me,
I really should go warn him.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.531
His Saab has leather seats.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.669
Alright, now you take
the brush, okay.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.713
And just ever so gently,
gingerly, sweep it away.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.882
- You're very good at this.
- Mm-hm.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.552
I know what you're thinking, Hank,
and it's not true.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.514
Every once in awhile,
a guy suspects his wife

16:13.514 --> 16:14.932
has a thing for another man.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.725
That's not what I'm thinking at all.

16:17.267 --> 16:20.229
I'm thinking about... cheese logs.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.814
Uh-huh.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.650
My Nancy's going
to Corpus Christi this weekend

16:24.650 --> 16:26.777
for some migraine workshop.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.779
I'm suspicious as hell.

16:28.779 --> 16:31.448
- See you, sug.
- Feel better!

16:31.532 --> 16:33.075
Bring me back a shot glass.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.038
Good thing John Redcorn's going with her.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.957
He can keep an eye on things.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.601
What are you making?

16:59.685 --> 17:01.937
I'm making a problem go away.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.690
Uh-huh. What you got, possums?

17:04.690 --> 17:07.401
Nope. This jerk archaeologist who...

17:07.401 --> 17:08.986
You know what works for me?

17:08.986 --> 17:11.655
You slip a capful of arsenic
into a side of bacon.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.658
Well, that would be murder, Bill.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.417
What do you think would happen
if this know-it-all

17:23.417 --> 17:26.336
found a fake artifact
and thought it was real?

17:26.420 --> 17:28.255
What would Peggy think of him then, huh?

17:29.006 --> 17:31.925
Uh... I-- I mainly just know
about possums.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.036
Mmm. Mm-hmm!

18:05.709 --> 18:06.919
Find anything?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.629
Hmm? No, not yet.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.881
Huh. You've been at it all morning.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.342
Think you'd have turned up
something by now.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.052
Well, archaeology is a game of patience.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.846
You know, that sounds a lot like fishing.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.057
Sometimes when you're not having any luck

18:20.057 --> 18:22.810
in one spot, you move to a new spot,

18:22.810 --> 18:23.852
like over there.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.396
Yup, that's where I'd fish.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.773
Right over there.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.861
Professor, come quick!

18:32.945 --> 18:34.613
- I've found something.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.828
Peggy, no. Leave that alone!

18:40.828 --> 18:42.079
You don't know what you're doing.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.123
Is that what you think?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.708
Well, I'm not quite sure
Professor Lerner would agree with you.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.001
You would be surprised

18:48.085 --> 18:49.670
what I've learned from him this week.

18:49.670 --> 18:50.587
Now...

18:51.505 --> 18:52.965
what do you suppose it is, professor?

18:52.965 --> 18:55.968
Oh, no, no. Tell us what
you think it is, Peggy.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.177
Okay.

18:57.845 --> 19:02.099
Well, this is most likely
a Tonkawa warrior necklace

19:02.724 --> 19:04.977
made from the... hmm...

19:05.602 --> 19:07.437
finger bones of his enemy.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.065
Really? Finger bones. Fascinating.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.567
How did you come to that conclusion?

19:12.359 --> 19:14.820
Well... They're bones, and...

19:14.820 --> 19:15.988
they're the size of fingers.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.656
So I just put two and two together

19:17.656 --> 19:18.740
and I added a thumb.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.828
You know, I just got a crazy idea.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.205
Let's find out what it really is.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.123
Scott?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.879
Uh, it looks like a
bunch of chicken bones.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.088
Correct. Barbara?

19:33.755 --> 19:37.217
- Scratched up with a belt sander.
- Of course. Andrea?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.011
And strung together with kite string.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.179
Bingo.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.763
They make it look so easy, don't they?

19:42.222 --> 19:43.140
You know their secret?

19:43.682 --> 19:44.975
They're archaeologists.

19:44.975 --> 19:45.934
What?

19:46.852 --> 19:47.895
I don't understand.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.523
Oh, I get it.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.818
Archaeologists, right. Archaeologists.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.822
Oh, I am such an idiot.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.909
Don't you believe it, Peggy.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.202
They're not so smart.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.162
I didn't use kite string.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.123
I used baling twine. Ha!

20:08.207 --> 20:09.124
You?

20:09.750 --> 20:10.584
But why?

20:11.335 --> 20:13.754
It's not enough that you think I'm stupid,

20:13.754 --> 20:15.756
you have to make me look stupid, too?

20:15.756 --> 20:18.008
What? I wasn't trying to...

20:18.008 --> 20:20.886
Peggy, you're the only one
around here I actually respect.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.971
I was trying to make him look stupid.

20:25.015 --> 20:28.143
Oh. don't tell me you were jealous.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.186
No!

20:29.186 --> 20:30.395
I was just, uh...

20:30.979 --> 20:34.358
mad because you were spending
all your time with that guy

20:34.858 --> 20:38.195
and, uh... I wanted you
to spend it with me.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.781
Jealousy had nothing to do with it.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.659
Ooh.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.993
Oh, Hank.

20:45.786 --> 20:49.039
I have something in my eye,
but I am also crying.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.926
What are you laughing at?

21:00.926 --> 21:03.887
Well, it's funny, isn't it? Sounds like
I could have scored with your wife

21:03.971 --> 21:05.347
for the price of a fake bracelet.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.390
What?

21:09.393 --> 21:10.936
Okay, okay, you pushed me in.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.814
Whatever it takes to make you
feel good about yourself.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.859
Mr. Hill, violence doesn't solve anything.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.569
So, why don't we just discuss this like...

21:20.487 --> 21:22.447
You know what's ironic about this?

21:22.531 --> 21:24.199
You're the one who looks stupid right now.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.702
Okay.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.412
So, you're stronger than I am.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.038
- You've proven that. Fine.
- Mm-hm.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.250
<i>I'm starting to enjoy this.
I'm really am.</i>

21:33.417 --> 21:35.085
<i>I want you to push me in the hole.</i>

21:35.085 --> 21:36.670
<i>Please, push me in the hole.</i>

21:36.670 --> 21:37.587
<i>Okay.</i>

22:09.911 --> 22:11.955
<i>You'll get tired of this
long before I do.</i>
