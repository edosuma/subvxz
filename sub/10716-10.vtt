WEBVTT

00:22.256 --> 00:24.158
You're not working today,
are you?

00:24.192 --> 00:26.861
I thought you were gonna
spend time with Maddie
before we leave.

00:26.895 --> 00:29.130
Oh, I just gotta go see
someone about a case.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.966
Shouldn't take long.
I'll be back before
she wakes up.

00:35.003 --> 00:37.138
I got a call from
a woman a few days ago.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.640
Said she knew my mother,
knows who killed her.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.042
Think she does?

00:41.075 --> 00:44.778
Probably just another dead end
like all the others,

00:44.812 --> 00:48.983
and I'll put it away again
till next time.

00:49.017 --> 00:51.485
You've been looking
at that book since I met you.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.087
Yeah.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.556
I'll be back in time
to take you guys for lunch.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.326
Maybe we can stop at the beach
on the way to the airport.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.094
Maddie'd like that.

01:31.025 --> 01:33.294
**

01:52.080 --> 01:55.216
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

01:55.249 --> 01:57.885
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

01:57.986 --> 02:00.388
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

02:00.421 --> 02:02.456
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

02:02.490 --> 02:05.526
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

02:05.559 --> 02:07.996
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

02:08.029 --> 02:10.999
* I got a feeling
and I can't let go *

02:10.999 --> 02:12.200
* I can't let go

02:25.613 --> 02:27.281
* I feel

02:31.152 --> 02:33.687
I moved back to L.A.
a few years ago

02:33.721 --> 02:36.024
after my husband passed.

02:36.057 --> 02:41.129
I was born here.
I wanted to die here.

02:41.162 --> 02:44.798
I had no idea you'd grown up
to be a detective

02:44.832 --> 02:46.767
till I saw your name
in the paper--

02:46.800 --> 02:49.770
- yours and Marjorie's.
- That case had nothing
to do with my mother.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.473
It was just a lawyer dragging
her name through the mud,

02:52.506 --> 02:54.042
trying to get to me.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.478
You said you know
who killed her.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.247
Yes, I do.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.849
I think I do, at least.

03:01.882 --> 03:05.553
We were good friends,
your mother and I.

03:05.586 --> 03:09.523
I babysat you many a day,
many nights.

03:09.557 --> 03:13.427
Tell me about the night
she was killed.

03:15.663 --> 03:18.066
We were careful.

03:18.066 --> 03:20.068
We had our regulars,

03:20.101 --> 03:24.138
and we took referrals,
I guess you'd say.

03:24.172 --> 03:27.641
That night, I had more dates
than I could handle,

03:27.675 --> 03:29.777
and I gave one of my regulars
to Marjorie.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.380
Who was he?

03:32.413 --> 03:35.983
He called himself Mitch.
It's the only name
I never knew him by.

03:36.084 --> 03:37.851
What did he look like?

03:37.885 --> 03:41.655
Big, tall, surfer.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.091
Broad shoulders.

03:43.091 --> 03:45.759
He had that look--

03:45.793 --> 03:48.162
tan, sun-streaked hair.

03:48.196 --> 03:52.866
- Did he ever hurt you?
- He could be a little rough.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.936
He liked to show you
that he was in control.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.738
Did he choke you?

03:59.240 --> 04:02.009
He put his hands
on my throat a few times.

04:02.110 --> 04:05.113
- Nothing more than that.
- Did you warn her?

04:05.146 --> 04:07.381
Did you tell her
what he was like?

04:07.415 --> 04:09.717
I did. I told her
he liked it rough.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.454
How could I know what
he was gonna do that night?

04:13.487 --> 04:16.690
Where did you send her
to meet this Mitch?

04:16.724 --> 04:19.560
City Center Hotel downtown.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.162
Room 7.

04:21.195 --> 04:24.632
I remember that,
because Marjorie said

04:24.665 --> 04:26.134
it was her lucky number.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.838
And you didn't go
to the police after
they found her?

04:30.871 --> 04:33.307
We didn't go
to the police.

04:33.341 --> 04:36.477
We didn't talk to the police.
We couldn't trust them.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.847
So you did nothing.

04:42.483 --> 04:47.288
When they found Marjorie,
I was so scared, I left town.

04:47.321 --> 04:50.358
At Union Station,
I made an anonymous
call to the police.

04:50.391 --> 04:53.761
I talked to a detective.
I told him about Mitch.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.297
Then I got on a train,
and I left.

04:56.330 --> 04:59.167
I left the town,
I left the life.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.769
What about the detective?
Do you remember his name?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.037
No, I don't.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.174
I got it from the newspaper.

05:06.174 --> 05:07.275
It said he was
the one in charge.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.843
Was it Caffrey?
John Caffrey?

05:09.877 --> 05:11.312
I don't know.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.181
I'm sorry,
I don't remember.

05:13.181 --> 05:15.916
And you thought
that would do it?

05:15.949 --> 05:19.086
An anonymous call
on your way out of town?

05:19.187 --> 05:21.989
That's all she was worth?

05:22.022 --> 05:23.624
Your close friend.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.828
Look, I thought
you would want to know this.

05:27.861 --> 05:31.799
I'm dying.
It was now or never.

05:36.237 --> 05:38.606
But you had to wait
until you were dying
to tell me.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.209
Harry...

05:42.376 --> 05:44.845
Thank you for telling me
at last.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.859
Turned off.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.505
- Want some of this?
- No, thanks.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.540
Forget it, Mom.
I've already tried
to convert him.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.542
Come on, it's really good.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.444
They start making
rocky road gelato,

07:23.477 --> 07:25.178
I'll give up ice cream.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.115
How'd your interview go
this morning?

07:28.148 --> 07:30.951
Something to follow up on.
We'll see.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.321
Not getting my hopes up.

07:36.490 --> 07:39.960
Can you push me on the swing?
My dad's busy.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.430
- Is it okay?
- Sure.

07:42.463 --> 07:44.031
- I'm Maddie.
- I'm Cora.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.041
Look at you.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.610
Even out here, you feel
like you need to protect her.

07:56.644 --> 08:00.348
- She's my little girl.
- She's not so little anymore.

08:00.348 --> 08:04.017
She'll always be my baby.
I worry about her.

08:04.051 --> 08:08.622
- And you.
- I'm gonna be okay.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.392
I was worried about you
before all this happened.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.529
I know you are.

08:17.698 --> 08:22.069
Harry, my world is
upside down right now.

08:22.102 --> 08:26.840
I don't know about work,

08:26.874 --> 08:29.142
my marriage,

08:29.176 --> 08:32.846
anything in my future.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.916
Reggie and I, we've...

08:35.949 --> 08:39.086
moved into that space.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.254
Now what?

08:41.288 --> 08:43.190
Couples take each other
for granted.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.858
Don't really talk anymore.

08:44.892 --> 08:48.061
You know, where we were
right before it was over.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.263
Well, that was my fault.
I blew it.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.866
We both did.

08:52.900 --> 08:56.003
I just don't wanna make
the same mistakes I did before.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.574
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it
to sound like that.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.642
It's okay.
I get it.

09:10.418 --> 09:14.021
Hey, guys.
Group hug?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.023
Maddie sandwich.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.961
I'm really gonna miss you,
Dad.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.430
Miss you, too.

09:56.864 --> 09:57.931
Need a room?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.536
LAPD.

10:02.570 --> 10:05.773
I'm working a cold-case
homicide from '79.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.976
How far back do your
registration records go?

10:09.009 --> 10:12.946
We got records that go back
to the day this place opened

10:12.980 --> 10:15.348
back in '53.

10:15.382 --> 10:19.286
So a cold-case homicide, huh?

10:19.319 --> 10:22.022
We didn't have
any murders here in '79.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.257
I'd remember.
I was here.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.327
Had a couple in '80,
but nothing in '79.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.799
Her body wasn't found here.
She might have been here
the night she was killed.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.801
You said you remember
those murders in '80?

10:33.834 --> 10:36.136
Oh, you always remember
the murders.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.871
Both women.

10:37.905 --> 10:40.741
One got stabbed.
The other got
her head bashed in.

10:40.774 --> 10:44.177
Blunt force trauma,
I think you call it.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.379
They ever get solved?

10:46.413 --> 10:48.516
Nothing ever
gets solved here.

10:50.684 --> 10:54.555
The registries are in the back
in the cabinets,

10:54.588 --> 10:56.189
and they ain't in order,

10:56.223 --> 10:59.192
and there are a few pages
missing here and there.

11:02.229 --> 11:07.200
Ah, knock yourself out.
I've got to get back
up to the counter.

11:07.234 --> 11:11.204
Gotta make sure my preverts
have a place to comingle
for the night.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.940
- Yeah, no problem.
- Okay.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.235
Mitch.

11:57.685 --> 12:01.221
You find what
you're looking for?

12:01.254 --> 12:02.590
Mind if I borrow this?

12:02.623 --> 12:05.793
If you promise
to bring it back.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.761
You said you remember
the murders.

12:07.795 --> 12:10.197
Do you remember a customer
named Fox Mitchell?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.733
No, I don't remember him.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.802
Is there anyone
in Room 7 tonight?

12:14.835 --> 12:18.338
Seven?
No, seven is open.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.907
I need to see it.

12:30.618 --> 12:33.353
Not like it was
back then.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.756
I know.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.940
I am glad you found time
to meet me.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.376
- I know you're
incredibly busy.
- What can I do for you?

14:03.410 --> 14:07.715
I need to know
where we stand, Irv.

14:07.715 --> 14:11.551
You made a promise,
a commitment to my candidacy.

14:11.584 --> 14:15.255
But you have to know
there will be consequences

14:15.288 --> 14:17.725
should anything change.

14:17.725 --> 14:19.727
Are you talking about
your grand jury?

14:19.727 --> 14:21.561
We're ready to issue
its findings.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.831
So issue them.

14:23.864 --> 14:27.500
The fallout will be intense

14:27.534 --> 14:30.170
for LAPD and you personally.

14:30.203 --> 14:34.407
Let me make something clear
to you, Mr. District Attorney.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.477
I agreed to accept the position
of interim chief of police

14:37.510 --> 14:39.179
to honor my son

14:39.212 --> 14:42.049
and help lead the department
out of this current crisis.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.617
But I will not be accepting
the job permanently,

14:44.651 --> 14:46.353
no matter who wins
the election.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.757
You're just gonna walk away?

14:49.790 --> 14:52.092
That's what interim means.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.662
And the Waits video?

14:55.763 --> 14:58.531
They have it.

14:58.565 --> 15:02.002
- Who has it?
- Them.

15:09.977 --> 15:13.781
- You didn't.
- Yes, I did.

15:13.781 --> 15:16.549
I think your grand jury
should have all the facts

15:16.583 --> 15:18.251
if they want to sit
in judgment.

15:18.285 --> 15:21.054
They should know who ordered
Raynard Waits' cuffs removed.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.890
They should know
who ordered that field trip.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.792
They should know
who was really responsible.

15:24.792 --> 15:27.327
You son of a bitch,
fuck you.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.941
Bosch.

15:44.845 --> 15:48.215
So I happened to be doing
my appointed rounds
in the bullpen earlier.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.251
I couldn't help but notice
a delivery on your desk
from archives.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.320
Two open cases from 1980?

15:53.353 --> 15:54.621
Good. That was quick.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.723
What was quick?
What are you doing?

15:56.824 --> 15:59.026
I ordered two unsolveds
from archives.

15:59.059 --> 16:02.629
- Your mother's case,
that was 1979, right?
- It was.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.831
I'm looking into
the possibility

16:03.831 --> 16:05.465
these other two cases
were connected.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.836
Unless I missed a memo,
you and Edgar were assigned
to the Nash task force.

16:08.836 --> 16:09.903
Where are you going
with this?

16:09.937 --> 16:12.139
For now, we're just
pushing paper, for RHD,

16:12.172 --> 16:14.207
tracing guns,
waiting for Nash
to raise his head.

16:14.241 --> 16:17.410
- What about Veronica Allen?
- She gets arraigned tomorrow.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.512
Edgar's putting together
the first discovery package.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.747
It's all well in hand.

16:20.848 --> 16:22.515
So meantime,
over the weekend,

16:22.549 --> 16:24.084
I got a call
on my mother's case.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.986
I spoke to a witness,
gave me a new lead.

16:26.019 --> 16:29.122
- You got a call?
- I got a call.

16:29.156 --> 16:32.259
Harry, these cases
are 35 years old.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.295
It doesn't matter.
Forget our victims?
What's that say about us?

16:35.328 --> 16:36.864
I know, I know,

16:36.897 --> 16:39.666
but we have a dedicated
cold case unit downtown.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.601
Maybe, but they're not
working these cases.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.270
And you know how it goes
down there.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.139
They pull a case, look for DNA
and fingerprints to run.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.708
If there's no magic bullet,
the case goes right back to
archives.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.912
So there was no DNA
or fingerprint evidence
in these cases.

16:51.945 --> 16:53.881
- None.
- All right.
So what's the connection?

16:53.881 --> 16:55.248
Why'd you pull them?

16:55.282 --> 16:57.184
The connection is
the City Center Hotel.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.352
A friend of my mother's
contacted me,

16:59.386 --> 17:01.955
told me my mother went there
the night she was murdered.

17:01.989 --> 17:04.191
- This is new information.
- Okay.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.759
I looked at
the murder journals
downtown in RHD,

17:06.793 --> 17:08.996
and there were entries
on two other cases

17:09.029 --> 17:11.564
associated with that place.

17:11.598 --> 17:12.966
A woman was murdered there

17:13.000 --> 17:14.902
seven months after
my mother's death.

17:14.902 --> 17:17.004
Another one was found
wrapped in a bedspread

17:17.037 --> 17:19.806
in an alley off Selma
six month after that.

17:19.907 --> 17:22.375
The bedspread came
from the City Center Hotel.

17:22.409 --> 17:25.378
- And the cause of death
was the same in all three?
- The guy was smart.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.547
Different M.O.s,
different races
on the victims.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.717
The only connection
is the hotel and that
they were prostitutes.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.020
Harry, this is
the longest of longshots.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.355
Exactly why I pulled
the files--

17:35.388 --> 17:37.925
to dig in and see.

17:37.958 --> 17:39.792
Maybe we should loosen
his shackles.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.694
Bosch, just do it.

17:41.728 --> 17:45.132
How the fuck did the Times
get this?

17:45.165 --> 17:47.034
Forget it, pal.
Come on.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.437
Barrel, when are you getting
that knee looked after?

17:50.470 --> 17:53.140
- September.
- Till then, he's got
the gag walk.

17:55.976 --> 17:58.111
What do you think it means?

17:58.145 --> 18:01.081
Above my pay grade.
Can't say I'm sorry
that it got out.

18:01.114 --> 18:04.151
I think O'Shea's run for mayor
just took a tumble.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.452
Yeah, huh?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.962
Okay, I'm almost done
for the day.

18:14.962 --> 18:16.964
I'll be there
in about an hour.

18:16.997 --> 18:18.698
Tell your brother
to have his shoes on

18:18.731 --> 18:20.433
and to be ready.

18:25.238 --> 18:29.609
Okay, so we collected
a total of six weapons
at the bank plaza

18:29.642 --> 18:31.979
and 68 shell casings.

18:32.012 --> 18:35.248
Two groups--
the Nash crew
and the Marks crew.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.051
What I'm focused on
as a priority is the Nash crew.

18:38.085 --> 18:42.522
Four weapons collected here,
here, here, and here--

18:42.555 --> 18:45.058
this being where the
submachine gun was recovered.

18:45.092 --> 18:47.427
And what do you have so far?

18:47.460 --> 18:50.663
Four different weapons,
one thing in common--

18:50.697 --> 18:52.299
obliterated serial numbers,

18:52.332 --> 18:54.434
most likely with
a metal sander,

18:54.467 --> 18:56.403
which still gives us
a halfway decent shot

18:56.436 --> 18:58.005
to restore
the numbers with acid,

18:58.005 --> 18:59.539
but it takes time.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.740
We don't have time, Lester.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.010
You can't force science.

19:03.043 --> 19:05.112
The acids we use
to restore serial numbers

19:05.145 --> 19:07.380
take a few days minimum
to do their magic.

19:07.414 --> 19:11.018
But call me tomorrow.
Maybe I'll have something.

19:11.051 --> 19:12.885
Anything on the ammo
I should know?

19:12.919 --> 19:15.488
Well, we could pretty much
match each weapon

19:15.522 --> 19:18.158
to the casings by caliber
and location.

19:18.191 --> 19:21.028
Everyone on Nash's crew
was shooting reloads.

19:21.028 --> 19:23.596
- All four weapons?
- Correct.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.498
Nash is a firearms dealer.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.400
Makes sense he might
recycle his brass.

19:27.434 --> 19:30.937
Did you find
a reloader at his house?

19:31.038 --> 19:33.240
No, we did not.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.608
**

20:20.787 --> 20:23.856
Are you sure that coin
you flipped came up heads?

20:23.890 --> 20:25.325
Come in!

20:29.096 --> 20:31.631
- It's you again.
- Yeah, it's me.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.639
Curry brand, my favorite.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.942
Fox Mitchell.

20:42.975 --> 20:47.380
Mr. Right To The Point, huh?
What was the name?

20:47.414 --> 20:50.016
You heard me--
Fox Mitchell.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.752
Um, his name
in the murder book?

20:52.785 --> 20:55.088
- No.
- Well, then
there's your answer.

20:55.122 --> 20:58.158
If it's not in the book,
it's not part of the case.

20:58.191 --> 21:01.194
Except you got
an anonymous call
about him from a woman

21:01.228 --> 21:02.929
after they found
my mother murdered.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.364
She gave you the hotel name,

21:04.397 --> 21:06.333
room number
where she was killed.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.869
Does that ring a bell now,
Detective Caffrey?

21:09.902 --> 21:12.239
Can't say it does.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.541
And how do you know
I got the call?

21:14.574 --> 21:16.676
Could have been my partner,
could have been anybody.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.846
She said she called
the detective named
in the newspaper.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.814
You were the point man
in the media,

21:21.848 --> 21:22.982
your name in every story.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.752
The City Center Hotel,
Room 7.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.888
That's where she was killed
before he dumped her body.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.324
You knew.
You were told.

21:31.358 --> 21:34.394
Don't tell me what I fuckin'
knew or what I was told.

21:34.427 --> 21:37.063
If it's not in the book,
it's not in the case.

21:37.164 --> 21:38.598
End of story.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.633
I'm gonna go out and smoke
one of these cupcakes,

21:40.667 --> 21:42.402
and you're gonna get
the fuck out of here.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.036
All these years,
I've been coming to you,

21:44.070 --> 21:47.274
asking about her case,
listening to your bullshit.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.709
But I know now, Caffrey.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.411
I know you took a dive.

21:51.444 --> 21:54.381
Don't you bring
that shit in here.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.683
Don't you fucking dare.

21:56.716 --> 22:00.753
I cleared 36 murder cases
in my time, you little shit,

22:00.787 --> 22:02.255
so don't you come in here

22:02.289 --> 22:04.957
playing junior detective
on my time.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.326
Who was Fox Mitchell?

22:06.359 --> 22:08.861
- I'm telling you to get--
- No, I'm telling you.

22:08.895 --> 22:11.264
She went to him.

22:11.298 --> 22:14.801
That night, she went to him,
and you knew.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.370
You were told.

22:17.404 --> 22:20.807
Who was Fox Mitchell?
Who was he?

22:26.045 --> 22:28.981
Fox Mitchell was
an alias, okay?

22:29.015 --> 22:31.218
- He was a snitch.
- A snitch for who?

22:31.218 --> 22:32.952
Major Narcotics.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.754
And you were told
to lay off him.

22:34.787 --> 22:37.590
I got the message.
Yeah, loud and clear.

22:37.624 --> 22:40.393
He was a prized
and productive informant.

22:40.427 --> 22:43.263
Big arrests, big seizures,
cocaine.

22:43.296 --> 22:44.897
They wanted to keep him
in place.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.699
You didn't even talk
to him off book?

22:46.733 --> 22:49.336
I did the right thing.
I asked narcotics

22:49.369 --> 22:51.238
to make him available
for questioning.

22:51.238 --> 22:53.039
That request was denied.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.107
So you just laid down on it.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.510
- I had no choice.
- Fuck that, no choice.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.879
And what about his real name?
Did you ever get it?

22:59.912 --> 23:01.548
The assholes
wouldn't give it to me.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.483
And what about Josephine Ford
and Cindy Black?

23:03.516 --> 23:07.420
- Who the fuck are they?
- Murder victims like my mother.

23:07.454 --> 23:09.456
- Never heard of them.
- Of course not.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.259
You were too busy
looking the other way.

23:12.259 --> 23:15.262
Bosch, don't be
so fucking judgmental.

23:15.262 --> 23:17.730
You know the department,
you know how it works.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.766
You get told to steer clear
of something,

23:19.799 --> 23:22.935
you steer clear,
or you get fucking rolled.

23:22.969 --> 23:26.539
And how was I supposed
to know for sure

23:26.573 --> 23:30.142
that this guy
was even the killer?

23:30.176 --> 23:33.045
She got killed.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.714
And who gets her case?

23:34.747 --> 23:36.616
You.

23:36.649 --> 23:39.286
My mother got you.

23:39.319 --> 23:41.488
She never had a chance.

23:59.306 --> 24:02.108
Defendant Allen, up.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.544
Attorney conference, now.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.156
He went berserk,

24:17.189 --> 24:19.392
yelling and screaming.

24:19.426 --> 24:22.929
He picked up a pair
of scissors.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.598
So I-- I...

24:25.632 --> 24:27.934
grabbed the closest thing
I could put my hands on

24:27.967 --> 24:29.436
to defend myself.

24:29.469 --> 24:32.972
And then he lunged at me,
and I--

24:33.005 --> 24:34.206
I hit him.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.176
- With the trophy?
- Yes.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.546
And how many times
did you hit him?

24:39.579 --> 24:44.351
Once or twice I don't--
I don't really remember.

24:44.384 --> 24:47.086
I was terrified.
I thought he was gonna kill me.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.956
- You feared for your life.
- I did.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.894
So is that enough?

24:54.927 --> 24:57.364
I can work with this.

24:57.397 --> 25:00.066
We'll dig deep
into Father Tabakian,

25:00.099 --> 25:01.801
find out all about him,

25:01.834 --> 25:03.870
all his secrets.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.372
Right now, he's the victim.

25:05.405 --> 25:08.841
By the time we get to trial,
you will be.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.377
Yeah.

25:21.821 --> 25:24.991
Detective Bosch.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.926
Ms. Chandler.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.562
- Didn't I say our paths
would cross again?
- Yes, you did.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.531
'Cause according to you,
I'm the kind of guy

25:31.564 --> 25:33.700
who can't stop stepping
on his own dick.

25:33.733 --> 25:36.636
And once again,
you've proven me right.

25:36.669 --> 25:39.506
You're defending
Veronica Allen?

25:39.539 --> 25:42.409
She called, I accepted.

25:42.442 --> 25:45.578
Thought it was time
to blow the dust off
my criminal court skills.

25:45.612 --> 25:49.982
High-profile case like this,
maximum media, perfect.

25:50.016 --> 25:53.319
Win or lose, can't bill
the city for this one.

25:53.420 --> 25:55.588
From what I hear,
the lady's near broke.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.624
I'm not too worried
about it.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.192
I think she can scrape
something together.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.094
Anyway, it's not
about the money.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.663
It's the challenge.

26:03.696 --> 26:06.666
And honestly, when I heard
your name, catnip.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.968
You two are made
for each other.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.803
I couldn't
agree with you more.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.274
How does the defendant plead?

26:15.307 --> 26:18.645
Not guilty, Your Honor.
Not guilty.

26:21.548 --> 26:24.784
We're talking about ignoring
exculpatory evidence.

26:24.817 --> 26:28.187
The detective in this case
has a history of misconduct.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.757
I proved that
several months ago
in the civil court,

26:30.790 --> 26:33.560
and I fully expect
to prove it again.

26:33.593 --> 26:36.829
- And so it begins.
- It never ended.

26:47.507 --> 26:49.576
Yeah.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.981
- What can I do for you?
- Thanks for the time.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.717
- I work Hollywood homicide--
- I know who you are.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.085
Here.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.959
So I'm working a case,
cold case,

27:06.993 --> 27:09.962
a string of murders,
late '70s, early '80s.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.565
A name keeps coming up
as a possible witness.

27:12.599 --> 27:15.001
It turns out the name's
an alias for a C.I.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.503
who was working for Majors.

27:16.503 --> 27:19.506
This guy was on
keep-away status back then.

27:19.506 --> 27:21.674
We're looking at nearly
40 years gone by,

27:21.708 --> 27:24.511
so I'm thinking
the C.I.'s probably
not making cases anymore.

27:24.544 --> 27:26.613
And you want the name?

27:26.646 --> 27:30.983
It's gotta be in one of
these snitch boxes, right?

27:31.017 --> 27:34.621
It doesn't matter
how many years ago it was.

27:34.654 --> 27:37.990
You need command staff approval
to access the C.I. files.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.526
You have that?

27:41.260 --> 27:44.531
What I got is a woman
who was strangled and left
in a Dumpster,

27:44.564 --> 27:47.033
another one stabbed,
and a third one beaten to death,

27:47.066 --> 27:49.001
and nobody gave a shit
about it back then,

27:49.035 --> 27:51.437
because the one guy who might
know something about it

27:51.538 --> 27:55.742
was making cases
for Major Narcotics.

27:58.578 --> 28:03.315
When I was a boot,
my T.O. wrote me up
three times for bullshit.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.685
He was one of those guys
took great joy

28:05.718 --> 28:07.620
in bending people over.

28:07.654 --> 28:10.557
- I've known a few of those.
- Complete asshole.

28:10.557 --> 28:13.225
Which, of course, meant
he rose through the ranks,

28:13.259 --> 28:16.563
wormed his way up to captain.

28:16.563 --> 28:18.297
Then I heard last year,

28:18.330 --> 28:19.899
a detective
in Hollywood division

28:19.932 --> 28:23.469
threw his ass through
a plate glass window,

28:23.570 --> 28:25.572
right in the fuckin'
watch office.

28:25.572 --> 28:28.808
That really made my day.

28:28.841 --> 28:31.778
We have a major operation
going tonight.

28:31.811 --> 28:34.046
I got here early
to plan it out.

28:34.080 --> 28:37.684
It's gonna be a long one,
and I need to start
stacking caffeine.

28:37.717 --> 28:39.952
You want something
from the break room?

28:39.986 --> 28:42.789
I'll probably brew a fresh pot.
It'll take a while.

28:44.591 --> 28:48.327
Uh, thanks.
I take it black.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.162
Okay. Back in a bit.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.317
God damn you.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.358
Hey, partner.
Where you been?

30:26.392 --> 30:28.327
Downtown. What's up?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.496
I think I've got something
here that we should
take a look at.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.132
- Run it.
- Firearms pulled numbers
on the weapons

30:33.165 --> 30:35.367
Nash and his crew
were using at the bank.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.336
Only partials
on two of them,

30:37.369 --> 30:39.471
but full serials
on the other two--

30:39.505 --> 30:42.441
Nash's SIG MPX

30:42.474 --> 30:44.176
and O'Grady's Beretta.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.445
- You run them through ATF?
- And here's the thing.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.214
Both weapons
were originally bought

30:48.247 --> 30:50.449
by Nash under his federal
firearms license.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.251
- Bought legit.
- Completely legit.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.453
And they were sold completely
legit to a second party--

30:54.486 --> 30:57.990
a hunting preserve
and gun range
up in Canyon Country.

30:58.024 --> 31:00.026
- Okay.
- According to ATF,

31:00.059 --> 31:02.161
but weapons were reportedly
stolen last year

31:02.194 --> 31:04.731
during a burglary
up at the hunting preserve.

31:04.731 --> 31:06.532
They were among several guns
reported stolen.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.434
So they were stolen,
but then they end up back

31:08.467 --> 31:11.237
in the possession
of the original dealer
and somebody on his crew?

31:11.270 --> 31:13.873
Sounds like a big coincidence,
doesn't it?

31:13.906 --> 31:16.075
What's that word you like?
Cahoots? That's what this is.

31:16.108 --> 31:18.978
Exactly. I mean,
Nash sells guns to this place,

31:19.011 --> 31:20.780
then he steals them back,

31:20.813 --> 31:24.016
takes off the serial number
and gives them to his crew.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.885
I mean, the original buyer,

31:25.918 --> 31:28.254
he's probably collecting
insurance on the whole deal.

31:28.287 --> 31:31.157
- That's like
laundering weapons.
- And something else.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.092
All of the ammo
that was used out there

31:33.125 --> 31:35.094
at the bank from
these weapons?
Reloads.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.797
I mean, every gun range
I've been to

31:37.830 --> 31:39.131
has a reloader
or sells recycled ammo.

31:39.165 --> 31:40.900
So we better go up there
and talk to this guy,

31:40.933 --> 31:42.401
maybe get a line on Nash.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.103
I mean,
that would be the plan.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.108
Except for this.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.442
Donald Boehner?

31:50.476 --> 31:52.544
Died eight months ago,
natural causes.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.480
I called up there
at the gun camp.

31:54.513 --> 31:57.784
A recording came on,
said they're no longer
open for business.

31:57.817 --> 31:59.819
- We check it out anyway.
- Yeah.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.864
- Chain's been cut.
- Probable cause.

32:44.897 --> 32:47.066
Works for me.

33:01.848 --> 33:03.282
Pull it over here.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.729
We'll go the rest on foot.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.365
I'm gonna grab the tube.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.549
Back up?

33:37.583 --> 33:39.451
Let's wait and see
what we got.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.586
- Bosch!
- I'm good!

35:41.807 --> 35:43.209
I ain't coming out here
vertical!

35:43.242 --> 35:45.244
You know that,
don't you, Bosch?

35:45.277 --> 35:48.147
That's up to you, Nash!
Doesn't have to be that way!

35:48.180 --> 35:51.017
What's the fuckin'
point?

35:51.017 --> 35:55.121
Trial? Prison?
Fuck that!

35:55.154 --> 35:56.588
You'd rather die here?

36:01.060 --> 36:03.629
Oh, you wanna make
a deal, Harry?

36:03.662 --> 36:05.497
I can give you Veronica!

36:05.531 --> 36:07.033
Yeah! Pictures!

36:07.033 --> 36:09.235
Tapes!
I got it all right in here!

36:09.268 --> 36:12.338
I'll tie it up
in a nice little bow for you!

36:12.371 --> 36:16.542
Or I can light it on fire
while we're waiting for SWAT!

36:16.575 --> 36:20.046
There's always
a deal to be made, Nash!
Put your weapons down!

36:20.046 --> 36:21.480
That's where we start!

36:21.513 --> 36:22.848
Bullshit!

36:22.881 --> 36:25.784
It starts when you get
a D.A. out here

36:25.817 --> 36:27.386
and put it in writing!

36:27.419 --> 36:30.256
SWAT comes, you go out
of here in a fuckin' bag!

36:30.289 --> 36:33.392
I put my gun down!
You put your gun down!

36:33.425 --> 36:35.661
Bullshit!
You know how this works!

36:40.632 --> 36:41.533
Bosch!

36:58.817 --> 37:01.087
Shit.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.851
This guy's gone.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.420
Cuff him anyway.

37:43.562 --> 37:44.730
Where are you going?

37:44.763 --> 37:47.599
- Evidence on Veronica.
- No, no, no, Harry, come on.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.835
Forget it.
She's not worth it.
Come on.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.991
So I just got off
the phone with RHD.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.228
You are technically
still on their books,

39:22.261 --> 39:25.331
but they can handle the mop up
on the case from here.

39:25.364 --> 39:27.233
So after your appointments
with Behavioral,

39:27.233 --> 39:30.068
I am prescribing some
downtime for you both.

39:30.101 --> 39:33.038
- Stay home a few days.
- Thanks, Lieutenant.

39:33.071 --> 39:37.476
But next Monday,
you're back in rotation.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.578
- Got that, Harry?
- Yeah, got it.

39:42.448 --> 39:44.082
Harry, you on
vacation already?

39:44.115 --> 39:46.252
You zoned out there.

39:46.285 --> 39:49.255
Just thinking about the one
loose end in this whole thing.

39:49.288 --> 39:51.490
- Layla?
- Yeah.

39:51.523 --> 39:54.293
I wonder where she is
with all that money.

39:54.326 --> 39:56.428
**

40:21.920 --> 40:23.422
Grazie.

40:55.587 --> 40:59.291
- Bosch.
- Sorry, Chief.
I don't want to intrude.

41:07.065 --> 41:10.336
I just wanted to watch this.

41:10.336 --> 41:13.138
The unveiling won't be
till next Sunday.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.707
- I can come back.
- That's not necessary.

41:30.489 --> 41:33.759
- I've done worse.
- Excuse me?

41:33.792 --> 41:37.262
That's what you said to me
first day in your hotel room.

41:37.363 --> 41:40.065
"I've done worse."

41:40.098 --> 41:41.967
What are we talking about,
Bosch?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.735
- Arno Epperson.
- Who?

41:43.769 --> 41:47.739
Arno Epperson,
also known as Fox Mitchell.

41:52.478 --> 41:55.381
Those are names
I haven't heard in a long time.

41:55.381 --> 41:58.784
I found your photo
in his snitch file.

41:58.817 --> 42:02.388
We won't go into how
you came to have that file.

42:02.388 --> 42:04.590
- What about him?
- I want to know where he is.

42:04.623 --> 42:06.925
- I wouldn't know.
- But you know who he is.

42:06.958 --> 42:10.128
I worked with him
on some major cases
when I was in Narcotics.

42:10.161 --> 42:13.832
21 tons of coke
in a warehouse in '92.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.501
That had to have given
you a step or two

42:15.534 --> 42:18.003
up the department ladder.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.439
We used a lot of informants.

42:20.472 --> 42:22.107
That's how you make cases
in that world.

42:22.140 --> 42:24.175
What are you
looking at him for?

42:24.209 --> 42:27.946
The murder of Marjorie Lowe,
my mother.

42:27.979 --> 42:30.582
Jesus.

42:32.618 --> 42:35.120
You tied Epperson
to your mother's murder?

42:35.153 --> 42:36.522
No, he did it.
And this department,

42:36.555 --> 42:39.090
the D.A.'s office
protected him afterward.

42:39.124 --> 42:41.827
Put him in
the relocation program.

42:41.860 --> 42:44.095
There may have been
other victims as well,

42:44.129 --> 42:45.063
besides my mother.

42:52.571 --> 42:56.141
Informants have always
necessitated looking away
at times--

42:56.174 --> 42:58.744
the greater good
rationalizations.

42:58.777 --> 43:02.080
But if he did something
like that, I was certainly
unaware of it.

43:02.113 --> 43:05.283
Somebody was,
but he was too important
to their investigation

43:05.316 --> 43:08.286
to take a fall for a few
murdered prostitutes.

43:08.319 --> 43:11.056
He got a free pass.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.058
Hard to believe.

43:13.091 --> 43:16.495
You know, a week ago,
you told me the murderer
of a cop.

43:16.528 --> 43:20.466
Your son was about
to be swept under the rug.

43:20.499 --> 43:23.068
You didn't find that
hard to believe.

43:25.937 --> 43:29.307
I don't have access
to relocation files,
but you do.

43:29.340 --> 43:31.042
You're the Chief of Police.

43:34.045 --> 43:36.014
I'll see what I can find out.

43:36.047 --> 43:37.315
- I'll call you.
- When?

43:37.348 --> 43:38.750
Soon.

43:55.934 --> 43:59.304
- What's up, man?
- Looking for Big Wave Dave.

43:59.337 --> 44:01.507
- He around?
- Dave?

44:01.540 --> 44:05.276
Uh, no,
he's not here anymore.

44:05.310 --> 44:07.212
Really?
He said he'd be here.

44:07.245 --> 44:10.381
- Impossible.
- How's that?

44:10.415 --> 44:13.018
He's been dead a while now.

44:13.051 --> 44:16.522
Yeah, he got cancer.

44:16.555 --> 44:19.591
- When?
- About two years ago.

44:19.625 --> 44:22.761
Felt funny.
Went in for a checkup.

44:22.794 --> 44:25.163
Five weeks later,
he was dead.

44:25.196 --> 44:26.932
Took him fast.

44:30.669 --> 44:34.039
- Were you a friend of his?
- No.

44:34.072 --> 44:37.709
- You go to the funeral?
- Yeah, I went. Why?

44:40.712 --> 44:44.182
- This him?
- Yeah, Dave Aronson.

45:12.110 --> 45:13.645
You won, didn't you?

45:16.281 --> 45:17.816
Got away with it.

45:32.130 --> 45:35.300
* Wish I were with you

45:35.333 --> 45:38.436
* But I couldn't stay

45:41.039 --> 45:43.975
**

45:44.009 --> 45:49.214
* Every direction
leads me away *

45:54.686 --> 45:58.624
* Pray for tomorrow

45:58.657 --> 46:01.359
* But for today

46:08.066 --> 46:10.168
* All

46:10.201 --> 46:13.538
* I want

46:13.639 --> 46:16.174
* Is to be home

46:23.915 --> 46:27.653
* Stand in the mirror

46:27.653 --> 46:30.055
* You look the same

46:35.661 --> 46:38.997
* Just lookin' for shelter

46:39.030 --> 46:42.868
* From the cold and the pain

46:47.673 --> 46:52.678
* Someone to cover

46:52.678 --> 46:55.113
* Safe from the rain

47:00.285 --> 47:03.221
* And all

47:03.254 --> 47:07.125
* I want

47:07.158 --> 47:10.128
* Is to be home

47:13.865 --> 47:17.703
* Echoes and silence

47:17.703 --> 47:20.005
* Patience and grace

47:26.244 --> 47:29.280
* All of these moments

47:29.314 --> 47:32.784
* I'll never replace

47:37.588 --> 47:41.259
* Fear of my heart

47:41.292 --> 47:44.262
* Absence of faith

47:46.564 --> 47:49.267
* And all

47:49.300 --> 47:53.739
* I want

47:53.772 --> 47:56.808
* Is to be home
