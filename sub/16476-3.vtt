00:47.004 --> 00:49.788
investigating the unsolved
murder of college athlete

00:49.790 --> 00:52.498
Mike Tasker, considered a "golden boy"

00:52.523 --> 00:54.293
for Hudson University's basketball team.

00:54.295 --> 00:55.677
Three years ago,

00:55.679 --> 00:59.298
Mike was found shot to
death in Central Park,

00:59.300 --> 01:01.383
the apparent victim of
a robbery gone bad.

01:01.385 --> 01:04.102
With no leads since the murder,

01:04.128 --> 01:05.554
the case had gone cold...

01:05.556 --> 01:07.055
That is, until earlier this year

01:07.057 --> 01:09.452
Open and Shut unearthed
a rape allegation

01:09.477 --> 01:11.977
from another college
student named Reese Burton

01:11.979 --> 01:13.812
that the police knew nothing about.

01:13.814 --> 01:16.899
Three years ago, she
filed an anonymous complaint

01:16.901 --> 01:19.651
accusing Mike of sexually
assaulting her on campus.

01:19.653 --> 01:22.037
The next week, Reese bought a gun,

01:22.039 --> 01:23.705
began stalking Mike,

01:23.707 --> 01:25.591
and the following
week, she threatened him.

01:25.616 --> 01:27.996
That was the night he was killed.

01:28.022 --> 01:29.402
All of this was unknown

01:29.427 --> 01:31.697
until my investigation began.

01:31.699 --> 01:33.549
Three years later, Reese's DNA

01:33.551 --> 01:35.167
has been placed at the
scene of the murder,

01:35.169 --> 01:36.502

Last time a stranger approached me

02:52.296 --> 02:54.913

02:54.915 --> 02:56.632
Ellen Huff sandbagged me

02:56.634 --> 02:59.084

said to make me into a killer.

02:59.086 --> 03:01.470

03:13.601 --> 03:16.768
Well, I thought we were through.

03:18.939 --> 03:20.939
Why do you think I'm innocent?

03:26.030 --> 03:30.115
Because rape survivors
react in different ways.

03:30.117 --> 03:32.351
And rage is one of those.

03:33.621 --> 03:36.455
Enough rage to kill their perpetrator?

03:36.457 --> 03:37.956
Absolutely.

A few weeks later, Mike was dead

04:34.815 --> 04:36.481

04:36.483 --> 04:37.864
I got a job, made new friends,

04:37.889 --> 04:39.318
put it behind me.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.436
And then, three years later, Ellen Huff

04:41.438 --> 04:43.355
uncovers your complaint against Mike?

04:43.357 --> 04:46.191
Yeah, this claim that
I filed anonymously.

04:46.193 --> 04:49.528
'Cause I didn't want to
forever be that girl...

04:49.530 --> 04:50.862
that girl that was raped.

04:50.864 --> 04:53.198
After Ellen outed me,

04:53.200 --> 04:54.950
the police reopened the case.

04:54.952 --> 04:57.836
They said that my hair matched
a hair on Mike's jacket,

04:57.838 --> 05:02.207
and boom, my world is upside-down.

05:02.209 --> 05:04.092
But Ellen twisted all the facts.

05:04.094 --> 05:06.428
What about this hair on the jacket

05:06.430 --> 05:07.913
that's a perfect DNA match?

05:07.915 --> 05:10.215
That makes sense.

05:10.217 --> 05:13.301
The night Mike was killed, he
was wearing the same jacket

05:13.303 --> 05:15.470
as the night he wore when he...

05:18.058 --> 05:20.442
...you know.

05:22.696 --> 05:24.780

09:54.551 --> 09:55.634
Huh.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.103
Never seen the trend line spike so fast.

09:58.105 --> 09:59.337
I mean, 70's a problem.

09:59.339 --> 10:01.890
80's.... intent to convict.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.909
90's... burn her at the stake.

10:04.911 --> 10:06.778
(exhales)

10:06.780 --> 10:08.396
She's guilty.

10:08.398 --> 10:09.108
I agree.

10:09.133 --> 10:10.682
MIRROR JUROR 2: Who heard
her making the threat?

10:10.684 --> 10:11.766
I mean, did that really happen?

10:11.768 --> 10:14.269
It was Mike's friend, Rob McKellen.

10:14.271 --> 10:16.071
They're bringing things
up from the podcast.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.315
I thought we put together
people who hadn't heard it.

10:18.340 --> 10:21.776
I did, and we instructed
them not to listen to it.

10:21.778 --> 10:23.111
What?

10:23.113 --> 10:26.581
These two were downloading
the podcast during lunch?

10:26.583 --> 10:28.116
As soon as they left the building.

10:28.118 --> 10:29.200
It's wet paint.

10:29.202 --> 10:31.536
They can't help but touch it.

10:31.538 --> 10:33.755
It's corrupted every member of the jury.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.424
BENNY: <i>We need to sequester the jury.</i>

10:36.426 --> 10:40.879
Judge Rand has denied
22 requests for sequesters

10:40.881 --> 10:45.350
out of 22, citing "a
waste of taxpayer dollars."

10:45.352 --> 10:47.052
Well, the podcast is already out there.

10:47.054 --> 10:49.387
It's been field-tested
by 25 million people.

10:49.389 --> 10:51.189
BENNY: If Amanda follows
Ellen's narrative,

10:51.191 --> 10:52.273
she'll get a conviction.

10:52.275 --> 10:53.525
Or...

10:53.527 --> 10:56.027
we replace Ellen's
story with a better one.

10:56.029 --> 10:58.730
I'm listening.

10:58.732 --> 11:01.032
Let me tell you a little story

11:01.034 --> 11:03.568
about an incompetent journalist.

11:03.570 --> 11:06.321
She takes a rape
victim and falsely accuses her

11:06.323 --> 11:08.206
of murder.

11:08.208 --> 11:09.324
(beeps)

11:11.161 --> 11:13.428
It's time to put Ellen on trial.

11:13.430 --> 11:16.481
We are going to dismantle her podcast.

11:16.483 --> 11:18.883
Reese Burton and her defense
team have subpoenaed my files

11:18.885 --> 11:20.752
in a desperate
attempt to distract the jury

11:20.754 --> 11:21.886
from a guilty client.

11:21.888 --> 11:23.471
Ms. Huff? Will you be sharing

11:23.473 --> 11:24.723
your information with the court?

11:24.725 --> 11:26.474
Freedom of the press is
one of our most sacred

11:26.476 --> 11:28.460
constitutional rights.
Woodward and Bernstein,

11:28.462 --> 11:30.863
Daniel Ellsberg. I, too,
protect my sources.

11:30.888 --> 11:31.930
(laughs) But are...

11:31.932 --> 11:33.648
Aren't those journalists
from some of the greatest

11:33.650 --> 11:35.266
news organizations in the country?

11:35.268 --> 11:37.185
Sadly, those dinosaurs
are no longer relevant.

11:37.187 --> 11:39.821
Today, citizen journalists
fulfill the important work

11:39.823 --> 11:41.689
of the Fourth
Estate, and I'll go to jail

11:41.691 --> 11:44.275
before compromising the
integrity of my podcast.

11:44.277 --> 11:46.611
(excited chatter)

11:48.682 --> 11:52.167
And the cell door closes on Open
and Shut with Ellen Huff.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.452
We don't have to worry about her
releasing any more episodes

11:54.454 --> 11:55.787
as long as she's in jail.

11:55.789 --> 11:57.956
So, you're a reporter now?

11:57.958 --> 12:01.425
I'm a citizen journalist.
I have a blog, check it out.

12:01.450 --> 12:03.620
CABLE: Yeah, we write about
anything and everything

12:03.645 --> 12:05.296
having to do with Reese's case.

12:05.298 --> 12:07.682
With Ellen in jail, we
can control the narrative,

12:07.684 --> 12:08.800
so, Cable,

12:08.802 --> 12:10.552
why don't you go
behind Instagram on Mike,

12:10.554 --> 12:11.970
see what social media has to say.

12:11.972 --> 12:13.938
We have a jury pool list yet?

12:13.940 --> 12:16.474
70 have daughters.

12:16.476 --> 12:18.026
82 have sons.

12:18.028 --> 12:20.111
People with daughters
should be on our side.

12:20.113 --> 12:21.362
Let's build a full motivational matrix

12:21.364 --> 12:23.481
of every possible
juror's thoughts on Mike,

12:23.483 --> 12:26.901
Reese, rape on campus
and college basketball.

12:26.903 --> 12:29.454
Which jurors have
abuse in their background?

12:29.456 --> 12:31.739
I'm still investigating,
but... it's a lot.

12:31.741 --> 12:34.209
I mean, statistically, one in four.

12:34.211 --> 12:37.295
So, Danny, let's dig
into the witness list.

12:37.297 --> 12:40.665
We need alternative
theories, unfollowed leads.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.802
Our case hinges on finding the
facts that Ellen ignored.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.920
On it.

12:45.922 --> 12:47.839
How'd you know she'd put herself in jail

12:47.841 --> 12:49.808
if we subpoenaed her raw interviews?

12:49.810 --> 12:51.893
Well, the podcast gave her notoriety,

12:51.895 --> 12:54.395
- but...
- Oh.

12:54.397 --> 12:56.815
Falling on the sword gave
her what she really wanted.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.517
Legitimacy.

12:59.519 --> 13:01.603
How much time you think we've bought?

13:01.605 --> 13:03.855
Well... as long as
Ellen's integrity will hold up

13:03.857 --> 13:06.441
against the county jail food.

13:06.443 --> 13:07.942
(crunches)

13:07.944 --> 13:10.161
Two days, max.

13:14.630 --> 13:16.568
CHUNK: <i>Reese, you're
going to appear in front of</i>

13:16.593 --> 13:17.747
<i>the jury today.</i>

13:17.772 --> 13:21.667
What you wear in court is
as important as what you say.

13:21.669 --> 13:24.086
You're wearing...

13:24.088 --> 13:25.471
I don't know what you're wearing.

13:25.473 --> 13:29.375
But it's at least three sizes too big.

13:29.377 --> 13:31.210
They're comfortable.

13:31.212 --> 13:33.679
That's not comfort,
Mama, that's camouflage.

13:33.681 --> 13:36.181
If you hide in front
of the jury in all that,

13:36.183 --> 13:38.267
they're gonna think
you have something to hide.

13:39.603 --> 13:42.554
Silk. It softens the look,

13:42.556 --> 13:44.390
and I'm sewing your pockets shut.

13:44.392 --> 13:46.692
Why?

13:46.694 --> 13:49.661
(chuckles) Look... your
hands are in your pockets...

13:49.663 --> 13:52.531
People automatically think you're

13:52.533 --> 13:54.700
being dishonest when they
can't see your hands.

13:54.702 --> 13:55.784
How we doing?

13:55.786 --> 13:57.236
Is it too late to run?

13:57.238 --> 13:59.321
I usually advise my clients to run

13:59.323 --> 14:00.656
before they get arrested.

14:00.658 --> 14:03.208
Um...

14:03.210 --> 14:05.110
Dr. Bull, this is, um...

14:05.112 --> 14:07.079
- this is... getting a little too real...
- Reese, it's okay.

14:07.081 --> 14:09.298
You're having a panic
attack. Come sit down.

14:09.300 --> 14:11.633
Just repeat after me. Okay?

14:11.635 --> 14:16.088
One, two, three,
seven, eight, four, two.

14:16.090 --> 14:18.474
(exhales) What?

14:18.476 --> 14:19.758
One, two, three,

14:19.760 --> 14:21.643
seven, nine, 11, six.

14:21.645 --> 14:23.896
(gasping): One, two,

14:23.898 --> 14:26.315
three, nine...

14:28.652 --> 14:32.688
One, two, three...

14:32.690 --> 14:34.440
seven, nine,

14:34.442 --> 14:36.608
eleven...

14:37.661 --> 14:39.828
six.

14:41.832 --> 14:44.500
How did you do that?

14:44.502 --> 14:49.037
The mind can't freak out and
count numbers out of order.

14:49.039 --> 14:51.256
How long you been
having these panic attacks?

14:51.258 --> 14:54.209
Ever since...

14:54.211 --> 14:56.595
Mike. I, um...

14:56.597 --> 15:00.516
(sniffles) I usually just go
running and it calms me down.

15:00.518 --> 15:02.518
Well, when this is over,

15:02.520 --> 15:05.471
you're gonna go
running whenever you want.

15:05.473 --> 15:08.173
Not because you have to.

15:09.477 --> 15:11.643
Which do you prefer?

15:11.645 --> 15:13.145
Still life with fruit,

15:13.147 --> 15:14.763
or this abstract painting? Your Honor,

15:14.765 --> 15:16.899
we're trying to hold a
voir dire session here,

15:16.901 --> 15:18.784
not an auction at Sotheby's.

15:18.786 --> 15:20.886
I prefer neither, Mr. Colón.

15:20.888 --> 15:22.154
Understood, Your Honor,

15:22.156 --> 15:24.656
but I do have the
right to ask the question.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.825
Not for long. Proceed.

15:28.245 --> 15:29.711
Uh, definitely the fruit.

15:29.713 --> 15:31.497
I like to know what I'm looking at. Hmm.

15:31.499 --> 15:33.081
What are we doing with art...

15:33.083 --> 15:35.918
and fruit? How does this help?

15:35.920 --> 15:37.386
People who like abstract paintings

15:37.388 --> 15:41.340
are open to new ideas. New stories.

15:41.342 --> 15:42.592
We just don't want to let the other side

15:42.616 --> 15:44.426
know what we're fishing for.

15:44.428 --> 15:47.162
How many of you prefer the fruit?

15:47.164 --> 15:49.932
Okay. Jurors number
four, seven and 12...

15:49.934 --> 15:52.684
Move to strike, Your Honor.

15:54.522 --> 15:56.822
BENNY: What should
the penalty be for rape?

15:56.824 --> 15:57.990
Prison.

15:57.992 --> 15:59.191
Five years minimum.

15:59.193 --> 16:00.425
He has a daughter?

16:00.427 --> 16:02.244
Granddaughters. Twin teenagers.

16:02.246 --> 16:04.530
- He dotes on him.
- BULL: He's in.

16:04.532 --> 16:05.998
Tell me about this ray of sunshine,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.033
Tom.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.002
MARISSA: 64. Divorced.

16:10.004 --> 16:11.803
Three times.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.373
We did a motivational matrix on Tom.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.041
Yeah, Bull.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.295
He uses very aggressive
language when he's online.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.562
Who's next if we bounce him?

16:20.564 --> 16:22.381
Uh, Wade Macklin. 32.

16:22.383 --> 16:26.969
Unmarried. Uh, professional organizer.

16:26.971 --> 16:30.522
Well, I like the sweater and the scruff.

16:30.524 --> 16:33.559
But he puts things in
boxes for a living.

16:33.561 --> 16:35.827
We only have one strike left.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.230
Hmm.

16:38.232 --> 16:41.116
(sighs) Okay.

16:41.118 --> 16:42.734
Does Wade have a pet?

16:42.736 --> 16:44.453
Labradoodle.

16:44.455 --> 16:46.154
He had back surgery last year.

16:46.156 --> 16:47.873
Cost Wade a whopping six grand.

16:47.875 --> 16:48.957
So cute.

16:48.959 --> 16:51.293
Oh, Wade.

16:51.295 --> 16:55.130
He may be rigid, but he has a heart.

16:55.132 --> 16:57.466
He loves his dog.

17:02.590 --> 17:04.172
The defense would
like to thank this juror

17:04.174 --> 17:08.510
for his time and service.
Move to strike, Your Honor.

17:08.512 --> 17:09.595
I'm 32 years old.

17:09.597 --> 17:11.063
I'm 32 years old.

17:11.065 --> 17:12.263
I lived in Paris for two years.

17:12.266 --> 17:14.066
I lived in Paris for two years.

17:14.068 --> 17:15.099
I'm an artist.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.734
I'm an artist.

17:16.737 --> 17:17.903
I work on Wall Street.

17:17.905 --> 17:19.538
I work on Wall Street.

17:19.540 --> 17:22.521
We managed to assemble a
mirror jury that makes me tingly

17:22.546 --> 17:24.992
in its perfection. Their
demographics line up

17:24.994 --> 17:26.778
82% with the actual jury.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.997
- BULL: How's the initial polling?
- Uh, three on the fence.

17:28.999 --> 17:30.415
Nine strongly in favor of conviction.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.217
Doesn't sound like
perfection if you're Reese.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.368
What... exactly as predicted,

17:33.370 --> 17:34.703
given the court of public opinion.

17:34.705 --> 17:36.705
At least these are the
type open to considering

17:36.707 --> 17:38.006
an alternate narrative.

17:38.008 --> 17:40.509
Cable, what did you find on Mike

17:40.511 --> 17:42.377
that the jury has not heard yet?

17:42.379 --> 17:44.463
A lot, starting with the fact

17:44.465 --> 17:46.865
that Hudson University had dozens

17:46.867 --> 17:48.216
of unreported sexual assault claims.

17:48.218 --> 17:50.806
And none of them
ended in criminal charges.

17:50.831 --> 17:53.021
And this story about sexual
assault on the Hudson campus

17:53.023 --> 17:54.856
that was in the New York Ledger

17:54.858 --> 17:56.558
today... is that a coincidence?

17:56.560 --> 17:59.311
Ellen doesn't have a
monopoly on exposés.

17:59.313 --> 18:00.862
Well, let's make
sure it links to our blog,

18:00.864 --> 18:04.283
though it doesn't help
enough with our case against Ellen.

18:04.285 --> 18:05.534
No, but...

18:05.536 --> 18:06.718
this does.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.687
Another Jane Doe filed an assault charge

18:08.689 --> 18:10.072
against Mike on campus

18:10.074 --> 18:11.239
that same semester.

18:11.241 --> 18:12.958
How could Ellen have missed that?

18:12.960 --> 18:14.376
Well, either she didn't do her homework,

18:14.378 --> 18:15.744
or it didn't fit her narrative.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.629
Let's find out who this Jane Doe is.

18:17.631 --> 18:19.131
I've got this one.

18:19.133 --> 18:21.733
DANNY: What if it was
Mike's girlfriend, Gina Stefano?

18:21.735 --> 18:23.969
In the podcast, she
said they were soul mates.

18:23.971 --> 18:26.505
But if so, their souls
bonded over their hot tempers.

18:26.507 --> 18:28.340
Apparently, these two fought constantly.

18:28.342 --> 18:30.475
BULL: She's the prosecution's
next witness.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.511
Benny, let's prepare a cross.

18:32.513 --> 18:34.613
♪ ♪

18:44.158 --> 18:46.652
Mike's former teammates and coach.

18:46.677 --> 18:48.360
AMANDA: When did you first
learn about Mike and Reese?

18:48.362 --> 18:50.329
We were on a break, when he had this...

18:50.331 --> 18:51.663
drunken hookup with Reese.

18:51.665 --> 18:52.831
And that didn't upset you?

18:52.833 --> 18:54.282
No.

18:54.284 --> 18:55.951
Mike told me everything.

18:55.953 --> 18:57.669
BULL: They're here for the prosecution.

18:57.671 --> 19:00.622
Amanda's good. I can see why

19:00.624 --> 19:02.311
you had a thing for her.

19:02.336 --> 19:04.126
Reese became obsessed with him,

19:04.128 --> 19:06.764
started stalking him.

19:06.789 --> 19:09.514
If I had known that she bought a gun,

19:09.516 --> 19:10.582
I would've told

19:10.584 --> 19:12.351
the police back then.

19:12.353 --> 19:14.603
Right on script. That's
the podcast verbatim.

19:14.605 --> 19:16.021
AMANDA: Nothing further.

19:18.025 --> 19:22.294
Ms. Stefano, did you and
Mike Tasker ever fight?

19:22.296 --> 19:25.564
- Sure. Every couple does.
- One friend reported

19:25.566 --> 19:27.833
that you often threw
dishes at each other.

19:27.835 --> 19:30.369
(scoffs) Okay, not often.

19:30.371 --> 19:32.394
Mike could get out of
line. Every once in a while,

19:32.419 --> 19:33.822
I had to pop him one.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.207
We were both very passionate.

19:35.209 --> 19:37.609
So passionate that you filed
an assault claim against him?

19:37.611 --> 19:39.411
Under a Jane Doe, is that correct?

19:39.413 --> 19:41.079
AMANDA: Objection, relevance.

19:41.081 --> 19:43.382
Your Honor, the
deceased is not on trial here.

19:43.384 --> 19:44.756
- I'll allow it.
- GINA: Look,

19:44.781 --> 19:46.418
I was just mad at him, okay?

19:46.420 --> 19:47.886
And I dropped it, like, a week later.

19:47.888 --> 19:49.654
We were both under a lot of pressure,

19:49.656 --> 19:51.640
and things got heated, and that's all.

19:51.642 --> 19:55.093
So you, a self-described
hothead, you were angry?

19:55.095 --> 19:56.094
(scoffs) Sure.

19:56.096 --> 19:57.145
- And under pressure.
- Yeah.

19:57.147 --> 19:58.980
- Did you kill Mike Tasker?
- Objection.

19:58.982 --> 20:00.148
Sustained.

20:00.150 --> 20:02.651
Did you ever tell Ellen
Huff about your turbulent

20:02.653 --> 20:04.236
relationship with Mike?

20:04.238 --> 20:05.987
She never asked.

20:05.989 --> 20:09.324
BENNY: So, Ellen Huff was
not interested in the truth.

20:10.994 --> 20:13.033
BENNY: She never asked.

20:17.626 --> 20:19.775
Just picked up Aaron and Claudia.

20:19.777 --> 20:21.811
Claudia read the Ledger's rape story

20:21.813 --> 20:24.947
and is convinced that Ellen
did a poor job reporting the facts.

20:24.949 --> 20:27.233
I take it you hacked her computer,

20:27.235 --> 20:28.484
implanted your news story.

20:28.486 --> 20:30.623
It wasn't very secure.

20:30.648 --> 20:33.956
Okay, Amanda's next
witness up is Rob McKellen.

20:33.958 --> 20:37.293
Fraternity brother and
Mike's best friend.

20:37.295 --> 20:39.521
What's all this about pedicures?

20:41.582 --> 20:43.132
Chunk.

20:43.134 --> 20:44.917
Back in college, he
and Mike Tasker traded

20:44.919 --> 20:47.753
a bunch of e-mails back
and forth scheduling pedicures.

20:47.755 --> 20:49.839
Pedis.

20:49.841 --> 20:51.674
Any of your teammates get pedis?

20:51.676 --> 20:53.559
Pedicures? (laughs)

20:53.561 --> 20:56.095
Who we talking about, these guys?

20:56.097 --> 20:58.931
No.

20:58.933 --> 21:02.685
Not these guys. I'm
thinking pedis... is code.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.540
BENNY: You ever get a
pedicure, Mr. McKellen?

21:08.565 --> 21:10.192
Objection, relevance.

21:10.194 --> 21:11.377
RAND: I'm curious.

21:11.379 --> 21:12.745
What? No, I...

21:12.747 --> 21:13.863
No?

21:13.865 --> 21:15.848
Then how do you
explain these e-mail exchanges

21:15.850 --> 21:18.868
between you and Mike
Tasker discussing your pedicures?

21:18.870 --> 21:21.329
What are you talking about?

21:21.354 --> 21:23.756
They're in evidence, Mr. McKellen.

21:23.758 --> 21:25.341
Subpoenaed by the state.

21:25.343 --> 21:26.375
See?

21:26.377 --> 21:28.294
You need an eye for detail

21:28.296 --> 21:29.962
to spot the significance.

21:29.964 --> 21:33.382
The prosecution didn't
notice that you used "pedicure"

21:33.384 --> 21:37.770
as code for PEDs, did they?

21:37.772 --> 21:39.271
Did you and Mike Tasker ever use

21:39.273 --> 21:42.274
performance-enhancing
drugs, also known as steroids?

21:42.276 --> 21:44.110
(page flips)

21:48.983 --> 21:50.399
Can I plead the Fifth, Your Honor?

21:50.401 --> 21:52.568
You may, Mr. McKellen.

21:53.788 --> 21:57.039
Podcast made Rob look like a Boy Scout.

21:57.041 --> 21:58.457
Should've known better.

21:58.459 --> 22:00.159
I like this attorney.

22:00.161 --> 22:01.327
He does his homework.

22:02.964 --> 22:05.247
Rob looks like my broker.

22:05.249 --> 22:07.133
I hate my broker.

22:08.553 --> 22:09.974
BENNY: Are you aware that

22:09.999 --> 22:11.554
steroids can make people aggressive?

22:11.556 --> 22:12.471
I've heard that.

22:12.473 --> 22:13.923
But I plead the Fifth.

22:13.925 --> 22:15.474
You have a gun collection?

22:15.476 --> 22:16.509
So what?

22:16.511 --> 22:18.961
Including three nine-millimeter
side arms?

22:18.963 --> 22:20.963
Have they been checked for
the ballistics in this case?

22:20.965 --> 22:22.598
I'm not on trial here. She is.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.567
Yeah, because of
what you told Ellen Huff.

22:24.569 --> 22:26.018
Objection.

22:26.020 --> 22:27.019
Withdrawn.

22:27.021 --> 22:28.437
Mr. McKellen,

22:28.439 --> 22:30.773
you were the last person to
see Mike alive that night,

22:30.775 --> 22:31.941
weren't you?

22:33.945 --> 22:37.113
Whatever.

22:37.115 --> 22:38.447
Whatever.

22:40.451 --> 22:42.084
Quite a job you did on Rob.

22:42.086 --> 22:43.285
He went up as a witness

22:43.287 --> 22:45.504
for the prosecution,
came down a suspect.

22:45.506 --> 22:47.490
At least according to Ethel and Sydney.

22:47.492 --> 22:50.292
BULL: And yet Wade is
even more convinced

22:50.294 --> 22:51.961
that Reese killed Mike Tasker.

22:51.963 --> 22:54.430
Oy, how is that even possible?

22:54.432 --> 22:56.298
It's called "backfire effect."

22:56.300 --> 22:58.717
When someone like
Wade locks into a story,

22:58.719 --> 23:00.853
even when they're shown
evidence to the contrary,

23:00.855 --> 23:02.605
they dig their heels in even more.

23:02.607 --> 23:04.690
BENNY: So the only narrative
Wade trusts is Ellen's.

23:04.692 --> 23:05.975
MARISSA: Fact that she's in jail

23:05.977 --> 23:09.028
only further confirms her integrity.

23:09.030 --> 23:11.614
Then it's time to break her out of jail.

23:11.616 --> 23:13.983
I'm gonna go play reporter.

23:13.985 --> 23:15.651
ANGELA: <i>Danny, you know how much trouble</i>

23:15.653 --> 23:16.986
<i>I could get in for this?</i>

23:16.988 --> 23:20.289
You are a patriot and my favorite
SoulCycle partner.

23:20.291 --> 23:21.824
You're lucky I can't stand Ellen.

23:21.826 --> 23:24.076
She thinks she's in a hotel.

23:24.078 --> 23:27.496
ELLEN: I had no idea jail
would be such a boon for the podcast.

23:27.498 --> 23:30.049
Another 100,000 downloads in two days.

23:30.051 --> 23:32.384
I've had three publishers
approach me about a book.

23:32.386 --> 23:33.502
This is a dream.

23:33.504 --> 23:35.471
That's taken completely out of context.

23:35.473 --> 23:37.606
How did you get that? It's
just.. hold on a second.

23:37.608 --> 23:38.841
I got to put this.

23:38.843 --> 23:39.444
This is new,

23:39.469 --> 23:41.560
so I got to... put this in here

23:41.562 --> 23:42.561
and then it goes to record,

23:42.563 --> 23:43.813
and I got to...

23:43.815 --> 23:45.347
- press that.
- Okay.

23:45.349 --> 23:47.266
- Thanks.
- (lock buzzes)

23:47.268 --> 23:48.267
(latch clicks)

23:48.269 --> 23:50.069
Um, so why did you say that?

23:50.071 --> 23:51.821
I recognize you from
the press conference.

23:51.823 --> 23:52.905
Who do you work for?

23:52.907 --> 23:54.573
(sighs) I work for a lot of people.

23:54.575 --> 23:57.076
This is a popular blog
that follows the trial,

23:57.078 --> 23:58.911
and, I got to say,

23:58.913 --> 24:01.197
the argument for the
defense has a lot of merit.

24:01.199 --> 24:03.916
Mm, everything I wrote was true.

24:03.918 --> 24:05.034
(laughs)

24:05.036 --> 24:06.752
Yeah, of course.

24:06.754 --> 24:07.753
But, I mean, it's pretty clear

24:07.755 --> 24:09.672
you left out a few key details, right?

24:09.674 --> 24:12.541
Like, um... Gina and Mike

24:12.543 --> 24:14.352
and their turbulent relationship.

24:14.377 --> 24:16.545
Kind of gives Gina motive.

24:16.547 --> 24:18.547
Well, she didn't buy a gun.

24:18.549 --> 24:19.882
But Rob had a gun collection

24:19.884 --> 24:21.116
and he was dealing steroids.

24:21.118 --> 24:24.053
All the top players on
their team did steroids.

24:24.055 --> 24:25.771
Really?

24:25.773 --> 24:26.889
When'd you find that out?

24:26.891 --> 24:28.390
And why didn't you report that?

24:28.392 --> 24:30.893
It's not relevant.

24:31.779 --> 24:34.063
So you just...

24:34.065 --> 24:36.899
you just decide which
facts are relevant,

24:36.901 --> 24:39.368
and then you deliberately
leave out other ones?

24:39.370 --> 24:41.453
No, you've got the
story completely wrong.

24:41.455 --> 24:42.488
No, I got my story.

24:42.490 --> 24:44.073
Good, all right, listen,

24:44.075 --> 24:45.207
my editors are all over me

24:45.209 --> 24:46.292
to file this story.

24:46.294 --> 24:48.177
Wait, what are you gonna print?

24:48.179 --> 24:51.497
That you only care about your
podcast ratings, and that

24:51.499 --> 24:53.082
you got to have information suggesting

24:53.084 --> 24:54.967
Gina and Rob are suspects

24:54.969 --> 24:57.136
and that's why you haven't
released your files

24:57.138 --> 24:58.170
to the court.

24:58.172 --> 25:01.757
But I am releasing my
files to the court.

25:01.759 --> 25:03.809
When did that happen?

25:04.679 --> 25:06.512
Just now.

25:07.765 --> 25:09.064
(soft chuckle)

25:09.066 --> 25:11.183
- (phone clacks on table)
- Okay.

25:11.185 --> 25:14.603
Uh... so...

25:14.605 --> 25:16.438
you're trying to kill my story.

25:17.491 --> 25:19.808
(lock buzzes)

25:19.810 --> 25:22.077
(latch clicks)

25:22.079 --> 25:23.779
Okay.

25:23.781 --> 25:27.283
Here's the deal.

25:27.285 --> 25:28.334
No more press conferences

25:28.336 --> 25:31.170
and no more podcasts until

25:31.172 --> 25:32.655
after the trial is over.

25:32.657 --> 25:34.757
Deal.

25:34.759 --> 25:38.427
And I get access to the files.

25:38.429 --> 25:41.013
Ugh.

25:41.966 --> 25:44.183
(snickers) I'm a big fan, by the way.

25:44.185 --> 25:46.302
All right, thanks.

25:46.304 --> 25:48.604
(rock music playing)

25:48.606 --> 25:50.022
Oh!

25:50.024 --> 25:52.608
(chuckling): That was terrible.

25:52.610 --> 25:53.475
(grunts)

25:53.477 --> 25:55.144
Darts are pure chance, my friend.

25:55.146 --> 25:57.112
- Uh-huh.
- Here we go.

25:57.114 --> 25:59.315
Oh, Amanda, what are you doing here?

26:03.391 --> 26:05.871
Oh, that's better. Look at that.

26:05.873 --> 26:07.156
Magic.

26:07.158 --> 26:09.325
(chuckles)

26:10.995 --> 26:14.296
How far in advance did you know
Amanda was prosecuting the case?

26:15.082 --> 26:16.332
How long you been missing Amanda?

26:16.334 --> 26:17.366
(dart hits board)

26:17.368 --> 26:18.534
What?

26:18.536 --> 26:20.669
Come on, man. I'm over her.

26:20.671 --> 26:24.807
You haven't seriously dated anyone
since you guys broke up.

26:26.677 --> 26:29.228
It's because I
haven't found anyone I liked.

26:29.230 --> 26:30.396
I'm picky.

26:30.398 --> 26:32.815
Ha. Like other dart players I know.

26:35.269 --> 26:37.186
Ah.

26:37.188 --> 26:38.854
Check you out.

26:38.856 --> 26:41.323
Stage managing my life with Amanda,

26:41.325 --> 26:42.825
pouring your life into Reese's.

26:42.827 --> 26:45.694
You ever gonna get
serious with a woman again?

26:45.696 --> 26:47.696
- (dart hits board)
- Whatever.

26:47.698 --> 26:50.532
REPORTER: And now we have
Ellen Huff live just moments...

26:50.534 --> 26:52.785
- Oh, there's Ellen.
- Right.

26:52.787 --> 26:54.753
- No, really.
- I have decided to share research

26:54.755 --> 26:56.255
from my investigation with the courts,

26:56.257 --> 26:57.373
so long as they protect my sources.

26:57.375 --> 26:59.792
And I promise you the truth is in there.

26:59.794 --> 27:02.094
- I'll keep you posted. Excuse me.
- (reporters clamoring)

27:02.963 --> 27:04.963
I told her no press conferences.

27:04.965 --> 27:06.882
No, technically it's not.

27:06.884 --> 27:09.551
They were waiting
for her at her apartment.

27:09.553 --> 27:12.354
(sighs) Are you her lawyer now?

27:12.356 --> 27:15.391
All right, let's finish these
drinks and go say hi.

27:18.145 --> 27:22.064
(sirens wailing)

27:24.618 --> 27:26.235
- BULL: Hey, what's going on here?
- OFFICER: Hold up there.

27:26.237 --> 27:27.569
DETECTIVE: It's all right,
Officer, I know him.

27:27.571 --> 27:29.822
- Let 'em through.
- BULL: Thanks, Detective.

27:31.968 --> 27:33.972
What happened?

27:34.011 --> 27:36.745
Looks like gravity.

27:36.747 --> 27:37.863
AMANDA: Forced entry,

27:37.865 --> 27:39.148
signs of a struggle.

27:39.150 --> 27:40.339
Ellen was pushed.

27:40.364 --> 27:43.635
We need your client at the
precinct for questioning.

27:56.755 --> 27:59.466
(foghorn blows in distance)

28:03.117 --> 28:04.933
- (panting)
- Hey.

28:04.935 --> 28:06.752
- You're fast.
- How'd you find me?

28:06.754 --> 28:08.120
Figured you needed to go for a run

28:08.122 --> 28:10.822
after you heard about Ellen's death.

28:10.824 --> 28:13.542
Are the police looking for me?

28:13.544 --> 28:17.095
You have about an hour.

28:17.097 --> 28:19.464
(crying): I'm sorry, I...

28:19.466 --> 28:21.600
I had to get out of my apartment.

28:21.602 --> 28:23.719
I, uh... I couldn't breathe.

28:23.721 --> 28:26.054
(breathing heavily): I... I...

28:26.056 --> 28:27.139
saw my photo on the news.

28:27.141 --> 28:29.308
Hey, hey, look at me. Look
at me for a second.

28:29.310 --> 28:30.776
- Come here, come here.
- No.

28:30.778 --> 28:33.195
Come here, it's okay.
Let's count, all right?

28:33.197 --> 28:34.313
- No.
- Remember?

28:34.315 --> 28:35.647
Say it.

28:35.649 --> 28:38.317
Seven, eight, nine, 11, one.

28:38.319 --> 28:40.652
Do it, look at me, look at me.

28:40.654 --> 28:42.321
Seven, eight, nine, 11, one.

28:42.323 --> 28:43.538
(out of breath): Seven.

28:43.540 --> 28:44.990
Eight. Nine.

28:44.992 --> 28:48.160
(breathing steadies)

28:48.162 --> 28:50.295
You're okay?

28:50.297 --> 28:52.914
I told you.

28:52.916 --> 28:54.967
(inhales sharply)

28:54.969 --> 28:57.386
You're okay.

29:00.641 --> 29:04.259
You've been running since your
senior year of college.

29:04.261 --> 29:06.645
And I have some news for you.

29:06.647 --> 29:09.314
What happened to you isn't gonna change.

29:09.316 --> 29:11.183
But you can't let it define you.

29:11.185 --> 29:12.684
You don't know what it's like!

29:12.686 --> 29:16.405
No, I don't know
exactly what it's like for you.

29:16.407 --> 29:18.240
How could I?

29:18.242 --> 29:20.942
But I do know what
it's like to be trapped.

29:20.944 --> 29:24.613
And helpless and afraid

29:24.615 --> 29:28.784
and too young to be
able to do anything about it.

29:31.622 --> 29:33.505
Is that why you do what you do?

29:33.507 --> 29:36.458
Why you're out here?

29:36.460 --> 29:40.345
In the middle of the night?

29:40.347 --> 29:44.016
Is that why you decided to help me?

29:47.855 --> 29:50.639
Well...

29:52.359 --> 29:54.309
- Understanding...
- (sniffs)

29:54.311 --> 29:57.529
why people do the things they do...

29:59.533 --> 30:02.534
...is really just understanding
yourself.

30:02.536 --> 30:03.902
And once you do that,

30:03.904 --> 30:05.787
you don't have to run anymore.

30:05.789 --> 30:07.622
Not from panic,

30:07.624 --> 30:09.741
not from whatever happened.

30:10.744 --> 30:11.960
We're gonna win.

30:11.962 --> 30:15.080
(sniffles) Okay.

30:17.634 --> 30:19.201
BULL: <i>You see, this is</i>

30:19.203 --> 30:20.919
time-stamped video footage
showing Reese

30:20.921 --> 30:22.337
entering her own apartment building

30:22.339 --> 30:24.056
at the time of Ellen's death.

30:25.325 --> 30:26.925
What's your e-mail?
I'll send it to you.

30:26.927 --> 30:29.561
- She could've left another way.
- Yeah. Maybe she has

30:29.563 --> 30:31.096
a jetpack.

30:31.098 --> 30:33.398
BENNY: Detective cleared my client.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.933
AMANDA: Don't go far.

30:34.935 --> 30:36.518
We have court in the morning.

30:36.520 --> 30:40.238
Amanda, clearly, the real
killer saw Ellen's press conference

30:40.240 --> 30:42.657
and got to her before she
could reveal his identity.

30:42.659 --> 30:46.078
You are free to bring that
theory up at trial.

30:46.080 --> 30:50.165
I know what Benny would do if
he was still in the D.A.'s office.

30:50.167 --> 30:53.785
He would drop the case and
go after the real killer.

30:55.339 --> 30:58.623
We still have a
subpoena for Ellen's files.

30:58.625 --> 31:00.292
They're now in
evidence for Ellen's murder.

31:00.294 --> 31:02.878
In which my client was
called in for questioning.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.713
You're not trying to keep
the files from me, are you?

31:04.715 --> 31:07.632
Come on, Amanda. I know you
wouldn't willfully engage

31:07.634 --> 31:09.134
in prosecutorial misconduct.

31:09.136 --> 31:10.969
Benny, have at it.

31:10.971 --> 31:12.938
You can take this by evidence
on your way out.

31:12.940 --> 31:14.473
But you can't keep assuming

31:14.475 --> 31:16.224
all your clients are innocent.

31:16.226 --> 31:19.478
All?

31:19.480 --> 31:24.032
I had a 93% conviction rate
when I worked for the D.A.'s office.

31:24.034 --> 31:26.401
One person, one innocent person...

31:26.403 --> 31:27.986
Forget it.

31:27.988 --> 31:30.038
There's a reason why I quit.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.456
You didn't quit. You were fired.

31:32.376 --> 31:35.043
I quit when I
realized I worked for a place

31:35.045 --> 31:37.712
that cared more about
getting convictions than having them.

31:39.583 --> 31:41.633
I'll see you in court.

31:42.753 --> 31:43.752
Cable.

31:43.754 --> 31:46.671
Have you convinced the public

31:46.673 --> 31:48.840
that Reese was not
involved in Ellen's death yet?

31:48.842 --> 31:50.759
Making progress.

31:50.761 --> 31:53.011
A couple of news
outlets picked up my story.

31:53.013 --> 31:54.896
BENNY: What story?

31:54.898 --> 31:56.064
"Sources report Reese

31:56.066 --> 31:57.883
has been cleared and
has an ironclad alibi.

31:57.885 --> 31:59.351
Therefore, the real killer

31:59.353 --> 32:01.686
may have killed Ellen
before she could reveal

32:01.688 --> 32:03.572
his or her true identity.

32:03.574 --> 32:06.775
The police are investigating
other suspects at this time."

32:06.777 --> 32:09.444
Throw suspicion on
someone other than Reese.

32:09.446 --> 32:11.146
Genius.

32:11.148 --> 32:12.781
And it might even be true.

32:12.783 --> 32:14.950
BENNY: Good use of media
to control the story.

32:14.952 --> 32:16.284
And here's the kicker:

32:16.286 --> 32:18.370
two naughty, naughty jurors

32:18.372 --> 32:19.504
clicked through to our blog

32:19.506 --> 32:21.256
and read the article.

32:21.258 --> 32:22.374
Hmm. It's nice work.

32:22.376 --> 32:23.375
That'll filter down

32:23.377 --> 32:25.177
to the rest of the jury by dinner.

32:25.179 --> 32:26.878
You know, if hacking doesn't
pan out for you,

32:26.880 --> 32:29.214
I think you have a
career as a shoddy journalist.

32:29.216 --> 32:30.966
- Thank you.
- In-in the best way.

32:30.968 --> 32:33.301
That means a lot.

32:33.303 --> 32:36.471
Danny, you find
anything in Ellen's file?

32:36.473 --> 32:37.496
No, not yet.

32:37.521 --> 32:39.524
This woman recorded
hundreds of hours of interviews.

32:39.526 --> 32:41.126
If we don't get anything from Ellen,

32:41.128 --> 32:43.195
- you think Wade will cave?
- BULL: No.

32:43.197 --> 32:44.563
We'll get a hung jury.

32:44.565 --> 32:46.982
Well, that may not be a bad thing.

32:46.984 --> 32:49.367
The D.A.'s not gonna want
to retry this case.

32:49.369 --> 32:51.369
Yeah, I understand, Benny,

32:51.371 --> 32:52.871
but anything short of not guilty,

32:52.873 --> 32:55.040
and Reese has to live the
rest of her life knowing the cops

32:55.042 --> 32:58.043
could come knocking on the
door and arrest her for murder.

32:58.045 --> 33:00.462
But it's not like we're
gonna put Reese on the stand.

33:00.464 --> 33:01.630
Are we?

33:01.632 --> 33:02.831
Without Ellen,

33:02.833 --> 33:04.583
Reese is the best witness we have

33:04.585 --> 33:06.668
and the only one who
might influence Wade.

33:06.670 --> 33:08.386
Not to mention...

33:08.388 --> 33:10.422
it's a story Reese needs to tell.

33:10.424 --> 33:12.557
It's one thing for
Reese to have a panic attack

33:12.559 --> 33:14.309
while sitting at a table

33:14.311 --> 33:15.810
where she can count to herself.

33:15.812 --> 33:16.895
On the witness stand...

33:16.897 --> 33:18.930
Amanda will destroy her.

33:18.932 --> 33:21.766
Make her look guilty when she freezes.

33:21.768 --> 33:23.318
That's what I'm counting on.

33:24.988 --> 33:27.606
If I say the wrong thing up there,

33:27.608 --> 33:29.991
they'll put me away for
the rest of my life.

33:29.993 --> 33:31.409
That's why we're here.

33:31.411 --> 33:33.245
To practice.

33:35.499 --> 33:38.283
Now, I'm gonna play the
role of the prosecution.

33:38.285 --> 33:42.454
<i>Ms. Burton, two weeks before
Mike Tasker's murder...</i>

33:42.456 --> 33:45.123
You bought a nine-millimeter
handgun, didn't you?

33:45.125 --> 33:46.508
Yes or no?

33:46.510 --> 33:48.677
Amanda's gonna try and
limit your answers to yes or no,

33:48.679 --> 33:50.795
but you have the
right to explain yourself.

33:50.797 --> 33:54.382
Yes, because I was
frightened for my life.

33:54.384 --> 33:57.135
She's very good at
restating what you said,

33:57.137 --> 33:58.762
but in her words and not yours.

33:58.787 --> 33:59.804
- Correct her.
- AMANDA: Frightened?

33:59.806 --> 34:01.890
And like everyone, you had a choice.

34:01.892 --> 34:03.108
Fight or flight.

34:03.110 --> 34:05.026
You chose fight. Threatened him.

34:05.028 --> 34:07.195
No, I threatened him
to stay away from me.

34:07.197 --> 34:09.531
You threatened to
kill him with your gun.

34:09.533 --> 34:10.614
BENNY: Objection!

34:10.617 --> 34:12.284
Badgering the witness.

34:12.286 --> 34:14.753
If you're not done with
an answer, you say...

34:14.755 --> 34:16.705
- I wasn't finished.
- Amanda knows

34:16.706 --> 34:17.822
you have panic attacks.

34:17.824 --> 34:19.741
She's gonna try and
elicit one on the stand.

34:19.743 --> 34:22.494
And when she does, you...

34:22.496 --> 34:24.013
will be ready.

34:24.038 --> 34:25.224
AMANDA: Mike sexually assaulted you.

34:25.248 --> 34:25.841
Yes.

34:25.866 --> 34:27.581
You reported it to the university.

34:27.583 --> 34:28.178
Yes.

34:28.203 --> 34:29.717
- And they dragged their heels.
- Yes.

34:29.719 --> 34:30.835
But that was something that...

34:30.837 --> 34:32.504
And you were furious
about that, weren't you?

34:32.505 --> 34:34.505
- Of course I was.
- You kept that rage inside.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.007
- I didn't say "rage."
- AMANDA: The entire campus

34:36.009 --> 34:37.676
turned up for Mike
Tasker's memorial service.

34:37.678 --> 34:39.594
REESE: A lot of people went, yes,

34:39.596 --> 34:41.110
who weren't raped by him.

34:41.175 --> 34:42.581
But you were glad Mike Tasker was dead.

34:42.606 --> 34:44.322
You can admit that.

34:44.440 --> 34:47.109
Can't you?

34:49.690 --> 34:51.356
Ms. Burton.

34:51.358 --> 34:53.908
Why does this topic make
you so uncomfortable?

34:53.909 --> 34:55.025
(breathing heavily)

34:55.027 --> 34:56.578
Ms. Burton, do you need a break?

34:56.580 --> 34:58.446
BULL: <i>Before a panic attack,</i>

34:58.448 --> 35:00.198
<i>people have their own</i>

35:00.200 --> 35:01.533
warning signs.

35:01.535 --> 35:04.703
The room starts to buzz, yeah?

35:04.705 --> 35:09.841
That can be your cue to
melt down or to start coping.

35:09.843 --> 35:11.406
What if I pass out?

35:11.431 --> 35:13.678
- You'll wake up.
- What if I throw up?

35:13.680 --> 35:14.546
We'll get you a bucket.

35:14.548 --> 35:16.214
You have an answer for everything.

35:16.216 --> 35:18.466
So do you.

35:18.468 --> 35:21.302
For every question Amanda's
going to ask,

35:21.304 --> 35:23.521
you have the truth.

35:23.523 --> 35:26.224
And no panic attack or prosecutor

35:26.226 --> 35:27.308
can take that from you.

35:27.310 --> 35:28.760
RAND: <i>The court will recess.</i>

35:28.762 --> 35:31.062
No, I don't need a break, Your Honor.

35:31.064 --> 35:32.731
No further questions, Your Honor.

35:32.733 --> 35:33.815
But she asked a question

35:33.817 --> 35:35.567
implying that I'm hiding something.

35:35.569 --> 35:37.419
I have the right to answer.

35:37.421 --> 35:39.404
Go ahead, you may answer.

35:39.406 --> 35:40.622
(sniffles)

35:42.576 --> 35:44.743
(Reese breathes heavily)

35:45.712 --> 35:48.646
(sniffles)

35:48.648 --> 35:50.582
(exhales)

35:55.138 --> 35:56.755
You're right.

35:56.757 --> 35:58.640
I couldn't stand Mike,

35:58.642 --> 36:00.675
but I was the last
person who wanted him dead.

36:00.677 --> 36:02.994
I wanted him alive

36:02.996 --> 36:05.597
because I wanted him
to pay for what he did.

36:05.599 --> 36:07.565
I wanted him to go to prison.

36:07.567 --> 36:10.485
I wanted him to feel what I felt

36:10.487 --> 36:14.105
and I wanted to ask him, "How
powerful do you feel now?"

36:16.026 --> 36:18.410
And I'll never get that chance.

36:18.412 --> 36:21.613
He is the one at peace, not me.

36:23.950 --> 36:27.001
Yes, I get these panic attacks

36:27.003 --> 36:29.954
because I was raped and bullied,

36:29.956 --> 36:33.041
which is exactly how
you're making me feel.

36:35.462 --> 36:37.846
I couldn't stand up for myself then,

36:37.848 --> 36:41.182
but I am stronger now.

36:41.184 --> 36:44.352
So, ask your questions, Ms. Prosecutor.

36:44.354 --> 36:47.305
I have nowhere else to be.

36:47.307 --> 36:50.275
I did not kill Mike Tasker.

37:00.854 --> 37:02.954
Yeah, she gets panic attacks.

37:02.956 --> 37:06.491
I get it, but the prosecution's
built a bulletproof case.

37:06.493 --> 37:08.359
No way I can acquit,

37:08.361 --> 37:10.228
especially since Ellen's dead.

37:10.230 --> 37:11.996
That podcaster lady had it all.

37:11.998 --> 37:15.583
All that's left is my closing argument.

37:15.585 --> 37:17.669
And we've got two hours.

37:17.671 --> 37:19.921
Ellen's got to have
something in her audio files.

37:19.923 --> 37:21.089
Danny.

37:23.477 --> 37:25.393
This looks promising.

37:27.147 --> 37:29.430
Ellen's raw, unedited audio.

37:29.432 --> 37:31.182
You're gonna want to hear that.

37:36.857 --> 37:39.330
Looks like we have reasonable doubt.

37:45.024 --> 37:47.159
We all know what
happened to Mike Tasker.

37:47.161 --> 37:48.377
Right?

37:49.797 --> 37:51.497
ELLEN: Reese was obsessed.

37:51.499 --> 37:52.715
Stalked him around campus.

37:52.740 --> 37:54.755
When he turned down her advances,
she bought a gun

37:54.780 --> 37:56.302
and threatened him.

37:56.304 --> 37:58.387
Social media.

37:58.389 --> 38:01.340
Twitter, blogs, Facebook.

38:01.342 --> 38:02.725
(laughing): It can be

38:02.727 --> 38:07.913
a terrific tool for
staying in touch, for connecting.

38:07.915 --> 38:10.349
For cat videos.

38:10.351 --> 38:11.817
But, you see, there's a difference

38:11.819 --> 38:14.236
between entertainment and the truth.

38:14.238 --> 38:17.740
And this podcast is a
work of pure fiction.

38:17.742 --> 38:19.692
How do I know?

38:19.694 --> 38:22.361
ELLEN: Once police matched
Reese's blonde hair...

38:22.363 --> 38:24.080
Shoot, brown. I need to start over.

38:24.082 --> 38:25.614
ENGINEER: I thought you
were going to bring up Mike

38:25.616 --> 38:26.699
and the team's steroid use.

38:26.701 --> 38:29.668
ELLEN: No, it gets too complicated here.

38:29.670 --> 38:30.753
I'm not gonna get into it.

38:30.755 --> 38:31.871
ENGINEER: Very good. Take two.

38:31.873 --> 38:32.831
That's an example

38:32.856 --> 38:35.007
of how Ellen chose the facts...

38:35.009 --> 38:36.542
to make a compelling case.

38:36.544 --> 38:41.046
Ellen thought it was "too complicated"

38:41.048 --> 38:43.232
to introduce Mike's steroid use,

38:43.234 --> 38:46.051
Gina's temper and assault charge,

38:46.053 --> 38:47.970
even Reese's panic attacks.

38:47.972 --> 38:52.057
I mean, Ellen's limited version
of the story may have made

38:52.059 --> 38:55.394
for compelling entertainment,
but that doesn't make it true.

38:56.898 --> 39:01.617
And it cost Reese her
job, her reputation,

39:01.619 --> 39:03.786
and it publicized to the whole world

39:03.788 --> 39:06.122
that she was raped.

39:06.124 --> 39:08.157
And you know what? It
landed her right here...

39:08.159 --> 39:10.409
on trial for murder.

39:14.916 --> 39:18.884
Please don't make the
same mistake Ellen did.

39:20.388 --> 39:22.588
She's not a murderer.

39:22.590 --> 39:25.424
She's a survivor.

39:25.426 --> 39:27.593
That's the true story.

39:36.454 --> 39:40.105
On the charge of
murder in the first degree,

39:40.107 --> 39:42.074
how do you find?

39:45.096 --> 39:49.498
WOMAN: We, the jury, find
the defendant, Reese Burton...

39:49.500 --> 39:52.117
not guilty.

39:53.504 --> 39:55.337
RAND: Court adjourned.

39:55.339 --> 39:57.540
(gavel strikes)

39:57.542 --> 40:00.259
(laughs)

40:00.261 --> 40:01.293
Will you look at that?

40:01.295 --> 40:03.045
I... I see the coach and his team

40:03.047 --> 40:04.680
aren't here for the verdict.

40:04.682 --> 40:08.300
Maybe you should look into
that doping scandal.

40:19.397 --> 40:20.713
(cork pops)

40:20.715 --> 40:22.398
CABLE: Enemy alert.

40:22.400 --> 40:23.649
Say the word,

40:23.651 --> 40:25.451
I hit the burn button. We lose it all.

40:25.453 --> 40:27.203
It's all right, Cable. She called ahead.

40:27.205 --> 40:29.622
We picked up Rob for questioning.

40:29.624 --> 40:31.156
He crumbled pretty quickly.

40:31.158 --> 40:33.325
Turns out Mike was about
to blow the whistle

40:33.327 --> 40:35.327
on the team using steroids,

40:35.329 --> 40:37.913
so the coach had
motive to kill Mike and Ellen.

40:37.915 --> 40:40.082
You were right.

40:40.084 --> 40:42.084
Mm.

40:42.086 --> 40:44.637
You came all the way
here to tell us this?

40:45.506 --> 40:48.190
Actually, I came to talk to you.

40:48.192 --> 40:51.577
Mm, I haven't had a sip of this yet.

40:51.579 --> 40:53.846
I'm gonna go play guitar.

40:56.100 --> 40:58.267
I was impressed.

40:58.269 --> 41:02.136
That passion... that's
what I first remember about you

41:02.161 --> 41:03.439
when you started at the D.A.'s office.

41:03.441 --> 41:04.440
(lightly chuckles)

41:04.442 --> 41:05.858
Look, Amanda, you don't have to.

41:05.860 --> 41:08.661
No, I do.

41:08.663 --> 41:11.747
That's why I was so upset after
your press conference.

41:11.749 --> 41:14.166
Well... you know how I felt.

41:17.255 --> 41:19.088
I just...

41:19.090 --> 41:22.041
felt like you weren't
taking me into account.

41:22.043 --> 41:23.342
I was still working there.

41:23.344 --> 41:25.010
Yeah.

41:25.012 --> 41:27.079
I could've handled that differently.

41:27.081 --> 41:29.265
Yeah.

41:31.352 --> 41:34.303
But I do get why you did it.

41:34.305 --> 41:35.971
Thanks.

41:35.973 --> 41:37.306
That means a lot.

41:37.308 --> 41:41.060
Just to be clear, don't
ever come up against me

41:41.062 --> 41:42.278
with a guilty client.

41:42.280 --> 41:45.564
Well... don't ever
prosecute an innocent one.

Huh?

Winning a case like this.

42:49.847 --> 42:51.764
Helping Reese.
