But I respect you wanting
to do it on your own.

23:48.432 --> 23:50.369
- Thank you.
- Well, make no mistake.

23:50.468 --> 23:51.937
It feels dumb.

23:52.035 --> 23:54.306
I set up your idiot cousin,
Adam, with a hedge fund.

23:54.404 --> 23:56.541
And he now owns a yacht.
- Mm-hmm.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.011
- But you are so much
smarter than him.

23:59.110 --> 24:00.440
So I know you can do it.

24:00.544 --> 24:02.014
- I really think I can.

24:02.113 --> 24:04.183
I mean,
it's only been one class,

24:04.281 --> 24:06.051
but kind of clicks for me.

24:06.150 --> 24:08.687
- Well, remember,
if it stops clicking,

24:08.786 --> 24:10.722
I can text Meghan Markle
and get you a job

24:10.821 --> 24:12.491
as her assistant like that.

24:12.589 --> 24:15.060
