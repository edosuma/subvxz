WEBVTT

00:35.744 --> 00:36.828
Ready.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.984
<i>Thank you all for being here.</i>

01:07.067 --> 01:08.443
<i>Today we mourn.</i>

01:08.527 --> 01:11.238
<i>We mourn the tragic loss of Silvia.</i>

01:11.780 --> 01:14.992
Fermin and his family invite

01:15.075 --> 01:18.912
anyone who has anything to say to Silvia

01:19.872 --> 01:24.251
or express your words as you want.

01:24.751 --> 01:28.088
Our town was poisoned by
the mercury from the mines.

01:28.672 --> 01:32.509
We had to abandon our dead
and our ancestors.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.054
The poison had filtered into their bones.

01:36.138 --> 01:41.476
Here we found a family who healed
our bodies and nourished our souls.

01:42.978 --> 01:47.774
Silvia always inspired us
to move forward and find our path.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.698
My wife was strong.

01:55.866 --> 01:58.118
Her will to live infused me.

01:59.203 --> 02:03.624
No matter how difficult life would get,
she never showed any worry.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.959
She lived for everyone.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.295
My love.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.885
In the world that we live in today,

02:14.968 --> 02:19.932
it is radical and rebellious
to live like Silvia.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.268
So today, we get to celebrate her

02:23.352 --> 02:25.312
and ask God,

02:25.896 --> 02:27.147
that like her,

02:27.731 --> 02:29.983
he gives us the capacity she had

02:31.401 --> 02:33.278
to overcome our challenges

02:34.571 --> 02:40.035
and to continue, with courage,
to walk towards a better world.

02:40.118 --> 02:45.207
I know Silvia wants us to continue
to strive to find a place of peace.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.292
We thought Casa Roja would be that place.

02:48.085 --> 02:53.382
Unfortunately, Casa Roja cannot escape
the forces of this corrupt world.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.260
Goodbye, Silvia. Goodbye, Casa Roja.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.190
Hello?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.192
Hey, it's me.

04:35.943 --> 04:36.944
<i>Hi.</i>

04:37.027 --> 04:39.613
<i>It's Dina. She left us.</i>

04:40.656 --> 04:42.157
What do you mean, "Left us"?

04:42.741 --> 04:43.992
<i>It's okay. I found her.</i>

05:30.873 --> 05:33.876
Sit down. Read that. Closely.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.684
You texted.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.648
Not you.

05:59.568 --> 06:00.819
I'm sorry.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.409
You should be.

06:17.878 --> 06:18.879
Right.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.090
Let's find somewhere quiet to talk, okay?

07:04.591 --> 07:05.968
That was really mean.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.052
I know.

07:09.221 --> 07:12.015
And sadly, that was kind of the point.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.270
And it backfired.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.564
Weird. Who would've thought
punching someone in the gut

07:18.647 --> 07:19.648
would make them wanna leave?

07:19.731 --> 07:21.358
Honey,
I was trying to get you to understand--

07:21.441 --> 07:26.238
Maybe we just stop
with the teachable moments, Dad.

07:27.406 --> 07:29.575
And let me speak for a minute.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.035
Yeah.

07:32.995 --> 07:33.996
All ears.

07:36.039 --> 07:40.669
There's no life for me here.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.008
Not one that I want, anyway.

07:47.926 --> 07:48.927
And…

07:49.678 --> 07:53.807
And not one you or Mom would want either,

07:54.600 --> 07:57.811
if either of you were being truthful.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.484
I wanna go home.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.904
- Can I talk now?
- No.

08:07.779 --> 08:08.864
I'm not done.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.869
I wanna go home.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.290
But the problem is…

08:20.417 --> 08:21.543
I don't have one.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.715
I have a family, but…

08:28.926 --> 08:30.219
I don't have a home.

08:31.512 --> 08:35.097
So, as you like to say,
"What's the solution?"

08:39.602 --> 08:40.729
You can talk now.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.481
I--

08:44.107 --> 08:45.108
I--

08:47.945 --> 08:49.071
I don't have one.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.700
You know,
that's such a better answer sometimes.

08:54.993 --> 08:57.204
So, what do you wanna do?

09:00.123 --> 09:01.124
Truthfully?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.044
I don't know.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.965
And that's okay.

09:10.759 --> 09:11.760
But…

09:13.554 --> 09:16.765
whatever I decide,
I need you to support it.

09:17.599 --> 09:18.851
I can do that.

09:20.143 --> 09:23.522
And the door is wide open.
And I mean that.

09:24.898 --> 09:25.941
No bullshit.

09:28.110 --> 09:31.405
And the door is wide open if you
ever decided you wanna come back.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.702
And all that being said…

09:38.912 --> 09:41.206
I don't have a solution to this. But…

09:45.586 --> 09:47.045
I do have an idea.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.340
I'll tell you when your mom gets here.

10:02.978 --> 10:04.563
Did you bring everything?

10:38.722 --> 10:39.723
Hey.

10:47.773 --> 10:51.026
I had a plan to try
to get you back to the States.

10:52.653 --> 10:53.654
It didn't work.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.451
I have nothing to offer you now.

11:04.456 --> 11:05.874
Maybe we're out of options.

11:07.251 --> 11:09.211
I think it's time I turned myself in.

11:09.711 --> 11:10.921
What good would that do?

11:19.179 --> 11:21.390
Maybe I need you
more than I thought I did.

11:27.229 --> 11:30.315
It kills me to think
that we couldn't take care of you enough.

11:30.399 --> 11:32.985
That you felt like you had
to do this on your own.

12:44.389 --> 12:48.268
It's in the middle of nowhere.
It's truly off the radar.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.062
Barely exists on most maps.

12:51.772 --> 12:56.443
Look. Got a mountainous trade wind shelter
on the west coast.

12:56.527 --> 12:59.112
Probably rains on that part of the island
most days.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.615
Perfect for crab cultivation.

13:02.157 --> 13:06.286
Other side, bright sunshine,
more than ample source of lumber.

13:06.787 --> 13:10.249
Fresh water, and the interior
drops off on a downward southern slope.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.334
Can farm on it. Build on it.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.546
Take a shower? You pick a waterfall.

13:16.046 --> 13:19.508
Hungry? Just pluck a mango on the way.
Litchis, bananas, coconuts.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.303
It's paradise.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.226
There's nothing there.

13:30.644 --> 13:31.645
Not yet.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.816
And who builds all this?

13:38.026 --> 13:41.196
- Us. Casa Roja does.
- Oh, my God.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.990
We move the whole operation down there.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.157
What's it called?

13:44.658 --> 13:46.785
It's called the same place
we already live.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.912
No, it's not.

13:49.788 --> 13:52.082
No cartels. No Zetas. Just us.

13:52.666 --> 13:53.709
True sanctuary.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.211
The Mosquito Coast.

13:57.421 --> 13:58.755
The last stop.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.340
Who owns it?

14:00.883 --> 14:01.884
You do.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.304
We do. It belongs to the Foxes.

14:07.139 --> 14:08.223
I like it.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.976
- 'Cause, I mean--
- No.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.186
We're going back.

14:13.604 --> 14:16.148
The three of us or all of us,
but we're going back regardless.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.233
We have to make a decision today.

14:18.317 --> 14:21.028
Or you could stay here and make Camp Fox.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.238
Good luck with that.
But you're doing it on your own.

14:23.322 --> 14:24.448
Mom.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.909
We're going home.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.911
I'm sorry, and where is that, exactly?

14:29.578 --> 14:31.455
Wherever we make home, but not there!

14:31.955 --> 14:34.291
And what does home look like, Margot?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.460
Oh, yeah, of course.
Dina's a kid who rammed a cop car,

14:36.543 --> 14:38.921
so back home, she'd probably just get
a slap on the wrist.

14:39.421 --> 14:40.672
But you?

14:41.465 --> 14:43.592
Domestic terrorism. Murder.

14:43.675 --> 14:46.094
- Dad, stop.
- No.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.179
Why are you being such a shit?

14:47.262 --> 14:49.848
You're not better off
than the rest of us, Allie.

14:49.932 --> 14:53.101
It was you who pulled the plug
on the NSA Sandpiper program.

14:53.185 --> 14:54.853
You sold out, only to regret it.

14:54.937 --> 14:59.233
So stop playing it off like it's
some heroic move. It's not. It's selfish.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.317
Guys!

15:00.400 --> 15:03.695
Hey, I'm not the one that's proposing
going back to that shithole.

15:03.779 --> 15:06.198
Forget prison, the whole country's
surrounded by barbed wire.

15:06.281 --> 15:07.658
The whole fucking thing's a prison!

15:07.741 --> 15:10.244
Jesus Christ! Shut up!

15:12.913 --> 15:16.834
When do you guys ever stop
for fucking once,

15:17.751 --> 15:19.086
to think about us?

15:19.670 --> 15:21.296
To think about what we want.

15:21.380 --> 15:25.217
- Honey, we've always thought about you--
- Bullshit, Mom.

15:26.176 --> 15:30.556
Since we've got here, all it's been is
your plan and Dad's plan and nothing else.

15:31.557 --> 15:33.642
You haven't asked me what I thought once.

15:34.226 --> 15:36.520
You haven't fucking asked Dina
what she thought once.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.565
You're doing the same fucking shit
that you always fucking do.

15:39.648 --> 15:41.525
You're making decisions for all of us.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.278
And you're putting ropes on our necks
and fucking dragging us

15:44.361 --> 15:45.696
like we're fucking dogs!

15:46.196 --> 15:49.950
Dina and I are powerless.
We sacrificed everything.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.076
What about you, Dad?

15:51.159 --> 15:55.539
What have you sacrificed for us?
Name one thing.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.708
No questions. No vote.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.669
No fucking idea what's happening.
What you guys are doing.

16:01.253 --> 16:06.633
I'm so fucking sick
of hearing about what's best for us.

16:06.717 --> 16:08.177
"For the kids."

16:08.260 --> 16:10.679
You treat us
like we're pieces of luggage, or--

16:10.762 --> 16:12.639
or your fucking puppets.

16:14.266 --> 16:15.809
When do we get a say?

16:15.893 --> 16:18.395
I mean, you're raising us
to be so independent, right?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.063
At what age do we get a say?

16:21.565 --> 16:23.066
Jesus Christ, Mom.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.570
I've spent my entire fucking life thinking
that Dad was the reason

16:26.653 --> 16:28.071
that we're living like this.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.990
And it was you.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.452
You lied to me my entire life.

16:37.539 --> 16:38.707
To both of us.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.543
I still don't know why.

16:42.794 --> 16:46.173
I don't even fucking know
how a lie can last that long.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.717
How does it go that long

16:48.800 --> 16:51.887
before one of you fucking owns up
and tells the fucking truth?

16:55.140 --> 16:56.183
Can we start there?

16:59.436 --> 17:00.854
I made a mistake.

17:03.315 --> 17:05.817
She's right. We both did.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.362
Allie, stop.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.911
You were so small.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.622
You were this big.

17:19.873 --> 17:20.874
And…

17:22.166 --> 17:26.046
before you could even speak,
we chose not to tell you.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.130
You too.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.885
And then time passed,
and again, we chose not to tell you.

17:31.969 --> 17:34.972
And then more time passed. You grew older.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.391
You learned to talk, and…

17:38.475 --> 17:40.227
and again we chose not to tell you.

17:40.811 --> 17:44.398
And then more time passed, and again
we chose not to tell you until it--

17:44.898 --> 17:46.900
it no longer mattered anymore,

17:47.484 --> 17:48.485
until it did.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.280
It does matter.

17:53.365 --> 17:54.366
This secret…

17:58.120 --> 18:02.457
that we kept has been like a poison.

18:05.878 --> 18:10.799
Sometimes I would look at you
laughing or playing, being silly,

18:11.300 --> 18:12.467
sometimes sleeping.

18:15.012 --> 18:18.223
And I would ask myself, this poison…

18:22.269 --> 18:24.855
when is the right time
to give it to my children?

18:30.652 --> 18:31.653
No.

18:32.613 --> 18:35.240
There is no right time,
so we never gave it to you.

18:36.617 --> 18:40.704
We thought we could start over.
It almost worked.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.208
God, I need a minute. Excuse me.

19:05.854 --> 19:08.440
You know, the truth is,

19:09.358 --> 19:11.568
I think I only know
how to live off the grid.

19:19.493 --> 19:20.869
I'm sorry I left you.

20:00.909 --> 20:01.952
What the fuck?

20:02.953 --> 20:04.121
No, Dina, don't look.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.541
Fucking Richard Beaumont is here.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.209
What?

20:09.293 --> 20:10.377
What is he doing here?

20:10.460 --> 20:12.671
Charlie, what are you doing?

20:15.007 --> 20:17.009
We made it, Papa.

20:17.092 --> 20:17.968
Finally.

20:18.468 --> 20:23.223
What we're building is going to make
this hotel look like fourth rate.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.456
Anyway-- Here we go.

20:47.539 --> 20:50.292
Finally.
I thought you went to the wrong hotel.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.376
Hello.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.628
- Good to see you.
- You too.

20:52.711 --> 20:53.921
- Sir.
- Sir.

20:54.004 --> 20:55.130
Please, let me introduce you.

20:55.714 --> 20:57.591
- This is my daughter, Claire.
- Hi.

20:57.674 --> 21:00.636
The Bautistas. And this is her pal, Annie.

21:00.719 --> 21:02.429
- I'm the plus-one.
- Nice to meet you.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.349
- All right, should we do this?
- Let's do it.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.560
- I am in agreement.
- Okay.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.979
Okay, enjoy yourselves.

21:11.063 --> 21:13.440
So, just wanted you to meet…

21:18.529 --> 21:20.864
- Bye! Have fun.
- Nice to meet you.

21:20.948 --> 21:23.116
- Little bit of a jog, but…
- I need this margarita.

21:51.979 --> 21:52.980
Charlie.

22:00.404 --> 22:02.364
Charlie, this is crazy.

22:12.541 --> 22:13.876
Charlie.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.339
What's wrong?

22:19.423 --> 22:21.216
I just saw some people I recognize.

22:23.260 --> 22:24.636
From where? Who?

22:24.720 --> 22:26.013
Developers.

22:26.555 --> 22:28.473
Richard singled them out to me.

22:29.183 --> 22:30.809
Maybe they're just staying here.

22:32.060 --> 22:35.731
Yeah. Let's just get the kids
and get the fuck out of here.

22:38.942 --> 22:40.194
We're just right in here.

22:40.736 --> 22:42.446
Excellent. Thank you.

22:43.197 --> 22:45.908
The video conference is ready.
The investors are logging on.

22:45.991 --> 22:48.994
Fantastic. Well, I think you can tell
where we're supposed to sit.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.038
- Why don't you take the middle?
- Thank you.

22:51.121 --> 22:52.873
Put the star in the center. Right?

22:52.956 --> 22:54.583
Yes, of course.

22:57.711 --> 22:58.712
Okay.

22:59.796 --> 23:01.590
Well, it's exciting stuff.

23:01.673 --> 23:04.092
Three signatures and we are gonna be

23:04.176 --> 23:06.970
one of the biggest developers
in the hemisphere.

23:07.596 --> 23:09.014
Northern and Western.

23:09.723 --> 23:10.724
Here they are.

23:11.683 --> 23:13.101
- Hello.
- Hello.

23:13.644 --> 23:15.062
Can you see us?

23:28.534 --> 23:29.743
Now, you two.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.828
Elevator, corridor, front staircase.

23:31.912 --> 23:34.373
- Conference room entrance.
- Got it.

23:34.957 --> 23:36.208
- You ready?
- Yes.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.043
Good. Let's go.

23:50.931 --> 23:53.392
- Where the hell are they?
- I can't find them anywhere.

24:00.274 --> 24:02.067
Shit. It's one of Guillermo's guys.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.151
You sure?

24:05.279 --> 24:07.239
I've seen him kill a guy with a machete.

24:07.322 --> 24:08.907
What the fuck is he doing here?

24:08.991 --> 24:09.992
Allie.

24:36.101 --> 24:37.603
Guillermo's guys work with Richard.

24:38.103 --> 24:39.938
- What makes you say that?
- He told me.

24:40.439 --> 24:41.690
- Who?
- Richard.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.736
All right, I'm gonna go check the beach.

24:45.819 --> 24:46.820
Okay.

25:05.547 --> 25:06.548
What?

25:13.180 --> 25:14.848
Gunmen on the third floor.

25:14.932 --> 25:16.558
Secure all guests and points of entry.

25:16.642 --> 25:18.185
Thank you all for joining us.

25:18.268 --> 25:20.229
We'll send the paperwork over
once we sign.

25:21.438 --> 25:24.274
Do you wanna do the honors and sign first?

25:24.358 --> 25:25.859
Nobody move!

25:25.943 --> 25:28.028
Hands on the table! You heard it!

25:30.072 --> 25:32.741
You sons of bitches! Do you know who I am?

25:44.545 --> 25:46.463
What the hell is going on?

25:49.675 --> 25:51.927
Charlie, what are you doing here?

25:52.427 --> 25:54.721
I saw those guys down there with guns
come up here.

25:55.222 --> 25:56.431
Is your mum here?

25:56.515 --> 25:59.518
You're a fucking liar and a hypocrite.
Everything you said before is a lie.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.311
- Answer me. Is your mum here?
- Fuck you.

26:03.814 --> 26:07.025
Pick up.

26:10.112 --> 26:11.321
Forget it, lady.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.288
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

26:19.997 --> 26:21.164
You may not know who I am,

26:21.248 --> 26:23.876
but I sure as hell know who you are,
Carter Albrecht.

26:25.460 --> 26:26.795
You are a criminal.

26:26.879 --> 26:29.423
You've committed crimes against humanity
and nature.

26:29.506 --> 26:34.178
You avoided a truth countless times
with your corruption and greed.

26:34.261 --> 26:35.554
They're not at the beach.

26:35.637 --> 26:38.056
We're out of time.
They're here to blow this place up.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.349
How do you know?

26:39.433 --> 26:41.727
Because I was at his house.

26:41.810 --> 26:43.687
I saw them, limpet mines.

26:43.770 --> 26:47.107
They're not the kind of shit you source
without a purpose.

26:48.358 --> 26:49.359
Hey.

26:50.527 --> 26:53.071
- Mom, Dad.
- Hey, where the hell is Charlie?

26:53.155 --> 26:54.156
I don't know.

26:54.239 --> 26:55.407
Richard grabbed him, took him.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.868
I knew it.
Did he see you? Was he with anyone?

26:57.951 --> 27:00.370
No, there was another group of armed men.

27:00.454 --> 27:02.497
- They have Charlie.
- Where did he take him?

27:02.581 --> 27:04.499
I don't know. Somewhere upstairs.

27:04.583 --> 27:06.502
- Right. Show me.
- Okay.

27:08.295 --> 27:09.755
You're polluting this planet.

27:11.632 --> 27:12.925
You've destroyed it.

27:18.889 --> 27:21.683
You are no better than a murderer.

27:23.852 --> 27:27.523
So, you'll confess to a worldwide jury.

27:28.232 --> 27:33.403
You and your platforms have tens
and thousands of followers. Right?

27:34.613 --> 27:39.493
So when the media picks up on this stream,
you'll have millions more.

27:43.163 --> 27:44.206
Excuse me.

27:44.289 --> 27:45.541
As a safety precaution,

27:45.624 --> 27:48.502
we're asking all guests
to return to their rooms, please.

28:01.348 --> 28:03.267
What the fuck is he doing here?

28:07.771 --> 28:09.773
Mister Dad!

28:11.316 --> 28:12.860
Beautiful little sister.

28:15.863 --> 28:17.322
We got a 30-minute window.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.623
<i>"My name is Carter Albrecht.</i>

28:27.207 --> 28:29.585
<i>I was born in Montauk, New York.</i>

28:30.878 --> 28:34.840
I ordered my companies to get rid
of 40 million liters of toxic waste

28:34.923 --> 28:39.803
and heavy metals from the mine
by pumping it into the Pasión River.

28:40.512 --> 28:43.182
<i>Which was the largest mining
environmental disaster</i>

28:43.265 --> 28:45.392
in the history of Central America.

28:45.893 --> 28:49.354
I admit my guilt, and I ask that…

28:54.526 --> 28:58.113
justice be done
that is commensurate with the crime."

28:59.114 --> 29:00.115
Fuck you.

29:01.783 --> 29:02.868
Fuck you.

29:04.244 --> 29:06.371
Get off me! Just-- Don't touch me!

29:08.248 --> 29:09.291
Third floor.

29:10.292 --> 29:11.293
What's that sound?

29:12.961 --> 29:13.795
All right.

29:19.885 --> 29:21.178
Stop! Don't move!

29:39.363 --> 29:40.614
Everybody down!

29:41.114 --> 29:43.325
- What was that?
- Fucking National Guard. I told you.

29:43.408 --> 29:44.785
Stay calm. Hallway.

29:46.078 --> 29:47.287
We gotta wrap this up.

29:47.371 --> 29:48.997
- No.
- We gotta wrap this up now!

29:49.081 --> 29:51.041
No. Continue.

29:51.124 --> 29:54.628
<i>"My name is Andrea Bautista."</i>

29:54.711 --> 29:58.298
I'm hit! I'm hit!

30:00.801 --> 30:02.344
You're going to be okay.

30:03.637 --> 30:04.847
All right, come on.

30:08.267 --> 30:09.726
Mom, it's not this floor.

30:09.810 --> 30:11.478
Hey. What are you doing?

30:11.562 --> 30:13.355
I'm gonna sweep the second floor.

30:13.438 --> 30:15.274
If there are devices,
this is where they'll be.

30:15.357 --> 30:17.401
- You don't know who's down there.
- They've got Charlie.

30:23.115 --> 30:27.703
"I hired a militia to forcibly remove
a village from the property."

30:27.786 --> 30:28.996
Faster, already.

31:09.077 --> 31:11.496
There's a couple of guys
with guns at the end of the hallway.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.919
We're in this stairwell,
right off the lobby.

31:17.002 --> 31:19.171
There's a second stairwell
that goes up the back.

31:19.254 --> 31:20.422
Yep, I've seen it.

31:21.798 --> 31:23.842
Guys, this whole place is laced.

31:24.343 --> 31:27.221
We've gotta get him out now.
Richard could want payback.

31:27.304 --> 31:28.305
Okay.

31:29.473 --> 31:31.934
I'm gonna check out that staircase,
see if I can do anything.

31:32.017 --> 31:35.562
- Okay, I'll come with you.
- No. Stay.

31:35.646 --> 31:37.481
No sense in all of us going, all right?

31:37.564 --> 31:39.066
What are you gonna do?

31:40.609 --> 31:42.027
Find another way.

31:44.488 --> 31:45.489
Hurry up.

31:45.989 --> 31:46.990
Yeah.

31:50.786 --> 31:55.040
<i>"There was a superficial
investigation into the killings,</i>

31:55.123 --> 31:58.126
but $600 to the prosecutor
took care of that."

32:01.672 --> 32:02.798
Why is he doing this?

32:04.424 --> 32:05.425
Richard?

32:06.218 --> 32:07.386
Yeah.

32:09.221 --> 32:10.514
He thinks he's being good.

32:14.643 --> 32:16.436
<i>"Ask only for justice."</i>

32:18.313 --> 32:20.440
Here it is. Justice.

32:20.524 --> 32:21.775
Sign it.

32:22.359 --> 32:23.861
So I give everything to you now?

32:23.944 --> 32:25.904
Yes, because you don't deserve it.
Now sign it.

32:31.201 --> 32:33.453
Please help. My brother is insane.

32:33.537 --> 32:37.040
<i>He killed my mother, and now he's going
to kill me and my father too.</i>

32:37.124 --> 32:39.168
- <i>Please help!</i>
- <i>Look, all right.</i>

33:03.817 --> 33:07.654
"I am Rafael Claudio Bautista.

33:07.738 --> 33:14.203
I have fathered fourteen children by girls
as young as 11 who live on my land.

33:14.786 --> 33:16.705
I've also raped the land.

33:17.206 --> 33:20.792
I burned 6,000 hectares
of the last reserve

33:20.876 --> 33:24.213
of the Scarlet Macaw six years ago."

33:26.006 --> 33:27.174
Sign it!

33:34.848 --> 33:36.308
Okay, we're out of here.

33:37.226 --> 33:38.352
Give me the detonator.

33:41.563 --> 33:42.940
Please give me the detonator.

33:58.497 --> 33:59.540
Charlie, let's go.

34:55.554 --> 34:56.847
Oh, shit.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.724
Charlie, go!

34:58.807 --> 34:59.808
Margot, door!

35:03.729 --> 35:05.981
- Dad!
- I wouldn't come closer, kid.

35:09.234 --> 35:12.863
Gotta say, I'm not best pleased
to see you and your family here.

35:12.946 --> 35:15.616
And I'm sorry for shooting you
in the back and all.

35:15.699 --> 35:18.076
But you seem inert to threats of violence.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.453
Times up, Allie.

35:19.536 --> 35:22.789
Your death will be slow,
but I'll show mercy to your family.

35:23.290 --> 35:24.333
Charlie, go to your mother.

35:24.416 --> 35:26.126
- Dad!
- Charlie.

35:26.627 --> 35:27.711
Don't be like your daddy.

35:29.129 --> 35:30.297
Charlie.

35:30.380 --> 35:31.423
Fuck off, Bill.

35:32.382 --> 35:34.218
Charlie, we have to go now.

35:34.718 --> 35:36.803
You ain't faster than a bullet.

35:38.305 --> 35:41.475
Charlie, go with your mother.

35:42.726 --> 35:43.852
Dad!

35:43.936 --> 35:45.062
It's okay.

35:46.813 --> 35:48.148
Do it for us.

35:49.066 --> 35:50.150
Come, sweetie.

36:19.471 --> 36:21.515
No, stop telling us to calm down!

36:24.768 --> 36:27.479
Please, just let us through.
My dad is up there.

36:39.950 --> 36:43.120
We've done this process before.

36:43.620 --> 36:47.457
The terrain and journey to get there
will be long and difficult.

36:47.541 --> 36:51.420
Please leave anything heavy
and of no value.

37:11.023 --> 37:13.150
- How's it going?
- Okay.

37:26.455 --> 37:27.664
I remember this.

37:43.388 --> 37:45.265
Let's go.

40:14.414 --> 40:17.251
Grab some stuff and take it over there.

40:19.211 --> 40:20.295
Charlie.

40:20.838 --> 40:24.132
How are you? Welcome. How was the trip?
