WEBVTT

00:22.814 --> 00:25.397
Well, I am happy to report
that my potato salad

00:25.609 --> 00:28.192
is once again the
hit of the potluck.

00:28.403 --> 00:29.939
<i>- That's great, honey.
- I feel bad</i>

00:30.155 --> 00:31.316
for Pam Staples.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.319
No one's touching
her potato salad.

00:34.243 --> 00:37.111
If you feel bad,
then why are you smiling?

00:37.329 --> 00:39.616
'Cause sometimes your
mommy's a big ol' hypocrite.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.707
Howdy, Coopers!
How we doing today?

00:42.918 --> 00:44.625
- Pastor Jeff.
- Thank you, Pastor Jeff.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.293
Y'all remember
my wife Selena.

00:46.505 --> 00:47.746
<i>- Hi, Selena.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

00:47.965 --> 00:48.955
<i>Â¿QuÃ© tal?</i>

00:49.174 --> 00:50.130
You're married
to her?

00:51.176 --> 00:51.962
Why, yes, I am.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.670
You can think it...
you don't need to say it.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.629
How are you liking Medford,
Selena?

00:57.808 --> 00:59.094
<i>Â¿CÃ³mo te gusta Medford?</i>

01:03.689 --> 01:04.724
She likes it fine.

01:05.065 --> 01:05.725
Oh.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.519
She needs to use
the little girls' room.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.270
Mary, could I talk to you
for a second?

01:12.656 --> 01:13.521
Sure.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.739
Don't worry.
I'll bring her right back.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.575
Wasn't worried, but okay.

01:17.995 --> 01:18.826
Okay.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.366
His Spanish is terrible.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.164
That's not what
she said at all.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.331
Oh.

01:25.794 --> 01:26.750
I don't know if you've heard,

01:26.962 --> 01:28.373
but our church secretary,

01:28.589 --> 01:30.672
Elizabeth Sohinki,
is currently seeking treatment

01:30.882 --> 01:32.669
for a little problem
with... shall we say...

01:32.884 --> 01:34.500
under-the-counter medications.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.586
Oh. So that rumor's true.

01:36.805 --> 01:37.716
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Well, she did</i>

01:37.931 --> 01:39.763
always seem extremely alert.

01:39.975 --> 01:42.137
Alert, shaky, sweaty. Anyway,

01:42.519 --> 01:44.101
we need someone to step in
and fill the position.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.020
I was wondering
if you might consider it.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.099
It's not just bookkeeping.

01:49.318 --> 01:52.186
<i>I'd be in charge of handling the
maintenance issues... you know,</i>

01:52.487 --> 01:53.898
plumbing, electric,
what have you.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.232
And I'd also head
the planning committee

01:57.534 --> 01:58.570
<i>for all the
social events,</i>

01:58.785 --> 02:00.742
which, of course,
includes the big three:

02:00.996 --> 02:02.612
baptisms, weddings, funerals.

02:02.831 --> 02:06.165
And here is the cherry on top.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.580
The sign in front of the church
with all the clever sayings...

02:09.795 --> 02:11.253
"Be an organ donor,
give your heart to Jesus"?

02:11.465 --> 02:12.455
Exactly.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.837
Guess whose job it would be
to write those.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.334
Yours.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.256
Already working on a couple.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.383
<i>Listen to this.</i>

02:22.225 --> 02:26.515
"The best vitamin
for a Christian is B1."

02:28.899 --> 02:29.605
What?

02:31.234 --> 02:32.224
<i>You know, be one.</i>

02:32.444 --> 02:33.560
Like be a Christian.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.021
And also B1 the vitamin.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.572
Well, now that you
explained it, it's funny.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.241
Yeah. Might be a thinker.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.785
But there's a lot more
where that came from.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.080
What about the twins?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.787
Well, I'll still get 'em off
to school every day.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.501
And when they get home,

02:50.712 --> 02:53.079
Mom can keep an eye on 'em
till I get back.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.751
Think she'll go for it?

02:54.966 --> 02:57.083
Are you kidding?
She loves 'em like crazy.

02:57.469 --> 02:58.255
Fat chance.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.927
Oh, come on.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.097
<i>You</i> come on.
I'm in the prime of my life.

03:03.308 --> 03:06.221
I got my water aerobics
and my salsa dancing

03:06.436 --> 03:07.768
and my bowling league.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.595
But you love your grandchildren.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.102
I love ice cream, too,
but I don't want to eat it

03:12.317 --> 03:14.354
from 3:00 to 6:00
five days a week.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.151
Well, I'm very disappointed.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.820
And I'm fine with that.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.397
Why don't you just
get a babysitter?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.858
Kinda defeats the purpose
of making extra money.

03:22.077 --> 03:22.908
Oh, yeah, right.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.486
All right, let's
think about it.

03:25.122 --> 03:25.953
Georgie.

03:26.164 --> 03:26.904
Football practice.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.116
- And I don't trust him whe <i>n I'm</i> home.
- Oh.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.876
Okay, now, what are we
talking about here?

03:32.170 --> 03:35.789
Sheldon is intelligent
and responsible,

03:36.007 --> 03:39.591
and Missy...
is his sister.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.294
I think they'll be
fine home alone

03:41.513 --> 03:43.800
all by themselves for a couple
hours after school.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.886
- You think?
<i>- I do.</i>

03:46.101 --> 03:48.218
As a matter of fact, I actually
think it'll be great for them.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.144
These kids today
are so coddled,

03:50.355 --> 03:51.971
I honestly think
y'all are raising

03:52.190 --> 03:54.523
a whole generation
of sissies.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.526
Is that the way you speak
about your grandchildren?

03:58.655 --> 03:59.645
Yes.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.044
Hi.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.425
How'd it go
with your mom?

04:25.640 --> 04:26.972
She's not interested
in watching 'em.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.016
Doesn't want to give up
her afternoons.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.560
Of course. Sorry.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.598
You know what, it's okay.

04:35.901 --> 04:36.937
The timing wasn't right.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.518
Maybe when the kids are older.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.063
Okay.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.947
I guess
I'll go get dinner started.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.708
How about this?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.124
Go ahead and take the job.

05:02.010 --> 05:02.750
Yeah, if it turns out

05:02.969 --> 05:04.301
Sheldon and Missy can't
look out for themselves

05:04.513 --> 05:06.300
for a couple hours
after school,

05:06.515 --> 05:09.633
then... well, we'll cross
that bridge when we come to it.

05:09.893 --> 05:10.724
Are you sure about this?

05:10.936 --> 05:12.552
Yeah. Actually,
probably good for 'em.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.763
Teach 'em a little
responsibility.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.064
That's exactly
what my mom said.

05:17.275 --> 05:17.981
Really?

05:19.069 --> 05:20.560
Well, I still like
the idea.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.188
Mmm.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.237
<i>Thank you, God, for this food</i>

05:27.452 --> 05:29.034
<i>we're about to receive,
and for the nourishment</i>

05:29.246 --> 05:31.613
<i>of our bodies, and bless
the hands that prepared it.</i>

05:31.832 --> 05:33.539
Amen.

05:34.543 --> 05:35.750
So, kids,

05:35.961 --> 05:38.248
we have a little family
business to discuss.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.920
- You're pregnant?
- No.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.918
- We're getting a puppy?
- No.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.340
I'm not sure I care.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.798
Starting next Monday,
I'm gonna take

05:47.013 --> 05:48.970
a full-time job
at the church.

05:49.391 --> 05:51.428
Well, who's going
to take care of us?

05:51.643 --> 05:54.181
Well, nothing will change in the
morning... I'll make breakfast,

05:54.396 --> 05:56.262
<i>take you both to school.
Then, after school,</i>

05:56.481 --> 05:58.268
you'll come home,
do your homework,

05:58.525 --> 06:00.141
watch TV,
play with your toys

06:00.402 --> 06:01.893
till I come home around 6:00.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.445
Well, why can't Meemaw
take care of us?

06:04.656 --> 06:06.943
- 'Cause she's not the person you think she is.
- George...

06:07.158 --> 06:08.945
You're really gonna leave
these two alone?

06:09.452 --> 06:10.112
Yes.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.036
That's a brave choice.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.572
Look, this job is important
to your mother.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.124
We expect you both to
step up and be responsible.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.743
I can do that.

06:19.671 --> 06:20.377
Missy?

06:21.339 --> 06:22.705
I'm thinking about it.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.166
Very brave.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.848
Okay, let's go over it
one more time.

06:37.188 --> 06:40.101
House key's under the
plastic owl by the front door.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.017
There's after-school snacks
in the fridge.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.228
One for each of you.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.482
Emergency numbers are
right there by the phone.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.567
First aid kit is
in the hall closet.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.119
And you won't be needing it,

06:54.331 --> 06:57.745
but under the kitchen sink
is a fire extinguisher.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.495
Ooh, that looks fun.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.954
For fires only, and don't be
starting one just to use it.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.881
It's like
she can read my mind.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.416
Don't worry, Mom.

07:07.636 --> 07:08.843
We'll make you proud.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.340
I know you will, baby.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.216
All set for your first day?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.923
- I believe I am.
- Mm.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.053
- Mwah.
- Mwah.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.054
Go get 'em.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.511
Thanks for waking me up.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.684
I woke you up
40 minutes ago.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.515
Well, you didn't do
a very good job.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.233
Bye, y'all.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.823
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.286
<i>Okay, later.</i>

07:38.041 --> 07:40.658
Sorry to bother you, Peg,
is Pastor Jeff available?

07:40.877 --> 07:43.585
Jeff! You available?!

07:43.797 --> 07:44.787
<i>On the phone.</i>

07:45.173 --> 07:46.709
He's on the phone.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.602
You know, my mother's had some
luck cutting back on the smoking

08:00.814 --> 08:02.055
by chewing that nicotine gum.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.559
Got some right here.

08:05.777 --> 08:06.893
So you do.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.026
<i>Come on in.</i>

08:08.446 --> 08:09.311
Go on, you heard him.

08:11.741 --> 08:12.902
Thank you.

08:13.743 --> 08:14.449
Hey, hey.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.576
Hey, Mare.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.404
Uh, you finding everything
you need?

08:18.623 --> 08:19.864
Oh, you bet.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.746
So, I've been going
over the books,

08:22.961 --> 08:25.328
and I think we have
enough money in our budget

08:25.547 --> 08:27.504
to purchase
a personal computer

08:27.716 --> 08:29.708
to handle all
the church business.

08:31.011 --> 08:31.751
Okay.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.756
Well, uh, why don't you
leave the paperwork here,

08:33.972 --> 08:35.087
and I'll-I'll take
a look at it.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.092
Of course.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.756
That's for your perusal.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.099
Everything okay?

08:43.565 --> 08:44.521
What?

08:44.733 --> 08:46.599
Yeah. Right as rain.

08:46.818 --> 08:47.899
<i>All righty.</i>

08:48.611 --> 08:49.897
Hey, if you have a minute,

08:50.113 --> 08:52.901
I would love to talk to you
about the sign out front.

08:53.742 --> 08:54.949
Yeah, sure.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.663
So far so good.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.476
<i>Hello?</i>

09:31.488 --> 09:32.774
Anybody?

09:35.950 --> 09:37.031
They weren't kidding.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.833
Maybe I'll just have
one little peek.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.545
How come you're not
eating your snack?

09:50.965 --> 09:54.549
I prefer my snack to be a
reward for homework well done.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.927
You're like an old person.

09:57.263 --> 09:57.878
Thank you.

10:08.108 --> 10:08.973
What's your homework?

10:09.192 --> 10:10.478
Non-Euclidean geometry.

10:10.693 --> 10:11.479
How about you?

10:11.945 --> 10:12.981
"Symonyms."

10:14.447 --> 10:15.858
You mean synonyms.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.236
I'm pretty sure
she said "symonyms."

10:21.246 --> 10:22.202
Did you see that?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.033
Someone's out there.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.958
Oh, no. They're
in the backyard.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.410
What do we do?

10:32.715 --> 10:33.330
Aah!

10:46.563 --> 10:48.771
Would one of you please
get me a towel?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.526
Why were you sneaking
around out there?

10:58.741 --> 11:00.152
Yeah, you scared us.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.576
I was checking up on you two.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.495
And in case you're wondering,
you scared me back.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.323
Well, why didn't you knock?

11:07.542 --> 11:10.956
Because you two are supposed
to be doing this on your own.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.833
And you don't
think we can.

11:13.047 --> 11:13.912
Of course I do.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.418
I'm the one who told your mother

11:15.633 --> 11:17.465
that you were fine by yourselves
in the first place.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.418
Then why were you
checking up on us?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.050
That's called being two-faced.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.506
We'll be okay on our own.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.432
Yeah, we need to prove
we can do this.

11:26.853 --> 11:27.843
All right.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.765
I respect that.

11:30.273 --> 11:34.313
And I'm happy to keep this
little incident a secret.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.189
Really? I'm
telling everyone.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.815
It was hilarious.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.731
I'm going bowling.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.621
When we first started dating,
everything was wonderful.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.452
That's when
it <i>is</i> wonderful.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.575
All the problems started
once we got married.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.502
Well, marriage will do that
to a relationship.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.046
I-I got Selena
a credit card

11:56.257 --> 11:58.214
to make small purchases
for the house.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.385
You know...
...coffee maker, DustBuster.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.007
You know what she did?

12:03.223 --> 12:04.714
She went to that
Sharper Image store

12:04.933 --> 12:06.390
and she bought a massage chair.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.809
Oh, I sat in one of those
at the mall.

12:09.020 --> 12:09.726
It was terrific.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.179
It's $2,000.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.435
Oh. Well, seeing as I know
how much you make,

12:14.651 --> 12:15.732
you can't afford that.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.402
I... uh-uh.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.445
<i>Of all the afflictions</i>

12:20.657 --> 12:24.150
<i>that can befall a child,
one reigns supreme.</i>

12:24.369 --> 12:26.986
<i>Beyond scraped knees
and paper cuts,</i>

12:27.288 --> 12:31.407
<i>nothing strikes fear into the
hearts of kids around the world</i>

12:31.626 --> 12:33.288
<i>like a splinter.</i>

12:33.503 --> 12:38.089
No!

12:38.716 --> 12:41.083
<i>Tell me why you were pretending
to have amnesia.</i>

12:41.302 --> 12:42.793
I've got a splinter!

12:43.680 --> 12:44.420
So?

12:44.639 --> 12:45.595
So, it's an emergency!

12:45.807 --> 12:46.638
Call Meemaw!

12:46.849 --> 12:47.805
Oh, calm down.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.430
- We can take care of this.
- No, we can't!

12:50.645 --> 12:53.558
Sheldon, if we can't handle
a little splinter,

12:53.773 --> 12:55.605
they're never gonna leave us
alone again.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.391
You're right.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.646
So, what do we do?

12:58.861 --> 12:59.726
Let me see it.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.779
Oh, boy.
That's a deep one.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.281
Hey, it's throbbing
really bad.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.157
Mom would take it out
with tweezers.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.285
Well, where would
we find tweezers?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.078
Let's see what we got.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.458
Band-Aids...

13:15.753 --> 13:17.244
<i>cotton balls.</i>

13:17.839 --> 13:19.205
What's "gowz"?

13:19.424 --> 13:21.336
It's gauze, and the fact
that you don't know that

13:21.551 --> 13:23.087
is not filling
me with hope.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.799
Where would Mom
keep the tweezers?

13:27.015 --> 13:29.302
- Sometimes she uses a needle on splinters.<i>
- No.</i>

13:29.517 --> 13:31.975
No needles. Anything
but needles.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.807
Wait, she has tweezers
in her makeup bag.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.559
She plucks her eyebrows
with them.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.099
And sometimes her mustache.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.440
Anything?

13:46.701 --> 13:47.657
Nope.

13:48.703 --> 13:49.363
<i>Wait.</i>

13:49.704 --> 13:51.036
Maybe they're
in her room.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.364
We're not allowed to go
in Mom and Dad's room.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.749
Want me to get the needle?

13:58.713 --> 14:00.170
Let's make this quick.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.622
Why are you whispering?

14:01.841 --> 14:04.003
That's how people speak
when they're being naughty.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.049
I wouldn't know.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.877
I'm naughty all the time.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.807
You're really not coming in?

14:17.231 --> 14:19.063
No. But you're doing great.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.150
What's wrong?

14:26.532 --> 14:28.319
This really is naughty.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.900
I told you.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.073
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

14:36.292 --> 14:37.749
There's just a Bible
and a flashlight.

14:40.671 --> 14:41.502
What do I do?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.956
Answer it but sound calm.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.426
Hello.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.549
Hey, it's Dad.

14:49.764 --> 14:50.800
How you guys doing?

14:51.057 --> 14:51.843
We're great.

14:52.809 --> 14:53.640
Glad to hear it.

14:53.851 --> 14:54.716
I'm watching TV,

14:54.936 --> 14:56.393
and Sheldon's reading quietly.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.100
I knew you could handle this.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.931
- I'm proud of you.
- You know what?

15:01.150 --> 15:02.436
I'm proud of us, too.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.109
Okay, baby doll,

15:04.320 --> 15:05.527
I'll be home in a couple hours.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.604
Stay out all night.
We got this.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.027
Wha... Love you, too.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.077
That was intense.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.781
I don't think I'm cut out
for this latchkey life.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.288
You answer it this time.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.586
I can't; I'm supposed to be
reading quietly.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.163
Answer it, Sheldon.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.878
Well, I'm not going in there.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.051
Hello. Cooper residence.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.628
Sheldon speaking.

15:30.847 --> 15:31.963
Hey, Shelly.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.297
Oh, hello, Mom.

15:33.808 --> 15:34.924
How's your day going?

15:39.272 --> 15:40.137
Shelly?

15:41.107 --> 15:44.271
Shelly? Shelly? You there?

15:44.527 --> 15:46.063
Yes, I'm here.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.028
She wants to know
how my day's going.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.195
Say it's going good.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.193
I can't say that.

15:50.408 --> 15:51.148
Why not?

15:51.367 --> 15:52.027
It's bad grammar.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.108
How are you supposed to say it?

15:53.327 --> 15:54.568
"It's going well."

15:54.787 --> 15:56.369
Oh, that's nice.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.072
I've got to get back to work,

15:58.291 --> 16:01.250
but I love you
and miss you very much.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.001
Okay.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.125
I handled that really <i>well.</i>

16:09.594 --> 16:10.425
Got a minute?

16:10.636 --> 16:12.377
Sure, come on in.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.547
I just wanted to apologize.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.929
I-It was wrong of me to unload
my personal business on you.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.680
Here it is,
your first day and all.

16:19.896 --> 16:20.761
Oh, that's fine.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.312
Always happy to lend an ear.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.435
Great, 'cause I didn't
tell you everything.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.813
Really?
'Cause you told me a lot.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.815
This morning,
while Selena was in the shower,

16:29.030 --> 16:31.317
I went through her purse
and I took the credit card.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.065
- Oh, my.
- Now,

16:33.284 --> 16:36.027
do you think that's stealing,
or is it doing the right thing?

16:36.245 --> 16:38.988
You know, saving us
from bankruptcy and whatnot?

16:39.624 --> 16:42.617
Wow. Um, yeah,
that's complicated.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.249
Um... going through her purse...
probably wrong,

16:46.464 --> 16:47.830
but on the other hand...

16:48.841 --> 16:50.082
...well, there is no other hand.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.917
You can't be
doing things like that

16:52.136 --> 16:53.172
and have a healthy marriage.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.628
Why don't you just talk to her?

16:54.847 --> 16:56.634
Explain
your financial situation?

16:57.517 --> 16:58.473
That...

17:00.603 --> 17:02.686
Oh, we're closing
the door now, okay.

17:04.397 --> 17:05.809
That's not so easy.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.061
Because of the language barrier?

17:08.486 --> 17:10.978
That, and I implied,
when we were dating,

17:11.196 --> 17:14.190
that I was... well-to-do.

17:14.407 --> 17:17.320
Oh, Pastor Jeff,
why would you do that?

17:17.662 --> 17:18.698
You saw her.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.119
Uh, she is the kind of woman

17:20.330 --> 17:23.243
that can make a man do
bad things.

17:23.667 --> 17:28.083
Well, I... I don't know
what to say to that.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.506
Maybe you ought to pray on it.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.125
You're right.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.051
You're absolutely right.

17:36.097 --> 17:36.962
I'll do that now.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.217
I'll do the same.

17:38.683 --> 17:39.514
Thank you.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.932
God, please give me the strength

17:48.150 --> 17:51.109
to not spread this juicy gossip
about Pastor Jeff.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.151
Amen.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.026
What are you doing?

17:55.324 --> 17:58.408
I'm reading quietly, so I don't
have to lie about it later.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.445
Found 'em.

18:01.664 --> 18:02.825
The tweezers?

18:03.040 --> 18:05.032
Mom's needles
and her magnifying glass.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.583
Absolutely not.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.376
Let me at least try.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.289
No.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.041
You're being a baby.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.374
Nothing you can say
will change my mind.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.084
What if it gets infected
and turns green

18:15.303 --> 18:16.669
and they have to cut it off?

18:19.390 --> 18:20.756
I think it's numb.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.136
Great, put your hand out.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.638
Wait, how do you plan
on sterilizing the needle?

18:28.357 --> 18:29.848
Mom uses a lit match.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.808
We're not allowed
to play with matches.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.314
What else would work?

18:34.238 --> 18:35.149
Alcohol.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.371
Stick your finger in there.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.494
I'll do the needle.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.201
Okay. I hope I don't get drunk.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.210
How long till you're sterile?

18:51.422 --> 18:52.037
I don't know,

18:52.256 --> 18:53.417
but I'm getting lightheaded.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.344
No matter what happens,
hold still.

19:08.064 --> 19:08.850
I can't do it.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.647
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

19:10.858 --> 19:11.598
Just let me get it.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.649
What if you slip
and stab me in the eye?

19:13.861 --> 19:15.147
I'm not gonna slip.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.275
Who always wins when we play...

19:17.490 --> 19:19.106
Be right back.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.406
<i>In 1989
the Milton Bradley Company</i>

19:27.625 --> 19:30.584
<i>had dozens of board games
on the market,</i>

19:31.587 --> 19:35.501
<i>but only one
where you were the doctor.</i>

19:38.386 --> 19:40.548
<i>Operation came complete</i>

19:40.763 --> 19:42.504
<i>with a red light-up nose,</i>

19:42.723 --> 19:46.012
<i>13 plastic body parts
for players to remove</i>

19:46.227 --> 19:51.643
<i>and, most importantly,
one pair of genuine tweezers.</i>

19:57.071 --> 19:59.609
<i>My sister performed
a medical procedure using</i>

19:59.824 --> 20:01.440
<i>a children's board game,</i>

20:01.659 --> 20:04.197
<i>while I bravely sat very still.</i>

20:17.007 --> 20:20.250
<i>I guess you could say
there were two heroes that day.</i>

20:26.475 --> 20:28.182
Gee, how do you suppose
that happened?

20:29.770 --> 20:32.683
- Hello?
<i>- In here.</i>

20:33.357 --> 20:35.394
Why does the kitchen smell
like whiskey?

20:35.943 --> 20:36.899
Ask her.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.103
Oh, dear Lord!

20:41.323 --> 20:43.406
Wait till you hear
what I did to Meemaw.

20:43.617 --> 20:46.735
<i>Our show came at number one.</i>

20:46.954 --> 20:48.536
<i>I did it! I did it!</i>
