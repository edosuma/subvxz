01:49.776 --> 01:50.878
Boy: I'll give you a boost
if you want.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.108
Laura: I don't need your help.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.068
Keith: Ooh. Hell,
she got you, buddy.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.484
Toss them beers. Here you go.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.819
You got it? Okay, let's go!

01:59.119 --> 02:01.405
All right. All right.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.244
Hold up, hold up! The beer.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.864
Take this. Take this. Come on.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.960
These damn shoes!

02:24.811 --> 02:27.644
Whoo! Come on in, it's warm!
Come on, buddy!

02:29.691 --> 02:32.103
Look, you can even wash your hair!

02:32.861 --> 02:34.351
I washed mine last month.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.153
Whoo!

02:43.830 --> 02:45.821
Laura, Keith, come here!
Look what I found.

02:46.708 --> 02:47.977
Scruffy boy: Holy shit.
Keith: What the hell's that?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.881
Laura: What is it?
Worker 1: The hell you doing?

02:50.128 --> 02:51.868
Get out of here, now!

02:52.255 --> 02:54.120
Geez! Come on!

02:58.178 --> 02:59.714
Worker: Goddamn kids.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.611
Turn off the beam, fool!

04:27.726 --> 04:30.342
Tom: Steve from dow,
Ted from union carbide...

04:30.812 --> 04:33.679
Jerry from exxon
and Andy from allied.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.522
Welcome to taft law, gentlemen.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.273
Before we get started,
a little housekeeping.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.228
Um, all of you know
this young man

04:42.324 --> 04:44.485
as the dedicated taft associate

04:44.576 --> 04:46.316
who for the past eight years has

04:47.287 --> 04:49.369
buried himself
in the superfund law.

04:49.664 --> 04:50.944
I'm not paying for that cleanup.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.699
Still it is my pleasure
to share with you

04:54.169 --> 04:57.332
that just last week, Rob bilott
was welcomed as a partner

04:57.422 --> 05:00.255
here at taft,
stettinius & Hollister.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.882
Good morning. Taft law.
One moment. I'll connect you.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.552
Good morning. Taft law.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.561
One moment, please.

05:16.608 --> 05:19.020
It's the governor's office
calling for uh,

05:19.694 --> 05:20.854
calling for Mr. Burke.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.032
May I help you?

05:25.408 --> 05:27.364
Wilbur tennant
calling on Robbie bilott.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.998
Rondell: Epa has saddled them
with the whole bill

05:30.038 --> 05:32.029
and given your client's
history at that site,

05:34.292 --> 05:38.160
I'll take it back to them.
Good. Tab 12, middletown...

05:38.338 --> 05:40.454
I know. I'm sorry.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.127
But they won't leave.
Who's they?

05:43.927 --> 05:46.168
I don't know.
They say they know you.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.308
Um... Robert bilott?

05:53.770 --> 05:56.227
Um, yes.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.641
They call it a landfill.
A dump's what it is.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.856
They told my brother and me
no chemicals, just trash.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.187
But we ain't stupid.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.030
I made them videotapes myself.
All the proof you need.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.998
They're poisonin' the creek,
killing my animals.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.118
I'm in the middle of a meeting.
So, I want a lawyer.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.821
Every damn one in parkersburg's
too yella to take my case.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.622
Rob. He wants you back in there.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.541
They all scared shitless
at dupont.

06:18.628 --> 06:19.868
Well, I ain't scared of nobody.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.544
Okay. Kathleen is my paralegal.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.747
She's gonna give you
a directory of lawyers.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.252
That's why
I called your grandma.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.552
What? My neighbor who tells me,

06:29.639 --> 06:30.799
call Alma white.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.466
Her grandson's some fancy environment
lawyer down in Cincinnati.

06:39.858 --> 06:43.100
Sir, I am a corporate
defense attorney.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.027
S07?
I defend chemical companies.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.989
Well, now you can defend me.
Tom: Rob!

06:50.368 --> 06:52.233
Uh, 30 seconds, Tom.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.115
Uh, I'm sorry, Mr... Tennant.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.243
I can offer you a referral.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.201
But I just don't see how I
can be of any help to you.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.377
You can start by watching
them tapes for one thing.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.954
Oh, let's go, Earl.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.877
I'm sorry.
I... I wish you all the luck.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.237
I don't need
your damn luck, boy!

07:08.261 --> 07:09.626
I need your help! Tom: Rob!

07:13.058 --> 07:14.138
Come on.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.394
I'm not arguing
with the overall analysis.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.560
My only point is that
whatever we decide upon...

07:32.243 --> 07:33.403
Lawyer: Thank you, gentlemen.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.072
Do you know where we're going?

07:37.916 --> 07:39.656
There's a place
right around the corner.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.829
Yeah? What the hell
was that all about?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.420
He knows my grandmother. Really?

07:45.715 --> 07:47.876
Well, my mom's from
West Virginia.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.833
Uh, from a town, parkersburg.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.760
Not us. My...
My father was air force.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.053
We... we moved around a lot,

07:54.140 --> 07:55.368
but we spent the summers there.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.633
Dow lawyer: Come on, terp. You're buying.
Of course I am.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.227
You can be
from West Virginia, Rob.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.513
I won't tell anyone.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.404
Tom: All right, gentlemen.
Morton's it is.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.525
Still deigned to eat
with us lowly associates?

08:18.164 --> 08:19.745
You can't drive an American car.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.000
Taft-hartley, union busting?

08:24.087 --> 08:25.748
We practically invented it.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.041
"We?"

08:27.132 --> 08:28.963
Besides, I know
a highly esteemed partner

08:29.050 --> 08:30.130
who still drives American.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.503
Some real clunkers too. Okay,

08:31.678 --> 08:33.339
yeah, but he collects them.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.128
That's different. Like his

08:35.223 --> 08:36.713
no-name college and law school.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.035
No offense. Are you
listening to this?

08:38.059 --> 08:39.390
Hey, you guys go ahead,
all right?

08:39.894 --> 08:42.385
Look, I didn't mean anything by it.
No. I gotta make a call.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.541
It's all right.
I'll see you there.

08:43.565 --> 08:44.930
Okay, we'll save you a fish log.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.018
You can be such an asshole.
James: Karla, it was a joke.

08:50.572 --> 08:51.932
Karla: Yeah.
James: We always joke.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.030
Karla: Oh, yeah. You guys are
a couple of jokesters.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.288
Alma: You've
reached the residence of Alma white.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.620
I can't come to the phone
right now...

09:09.716 --> 09:12.048
He's good. He's home
early tonight actually.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.050
Sarah's mom: Tell him I
said, howdy, partner.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.635
She says, "howdy, partner."

09:17.098 --> 09:18.804
Are we ever gonna
see him again on Sundays?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.928
Yes, he can still come
to Sunday dinners, mom.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.179
He's a partner, not the
President of the United States.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.015
I wanna make...
Do you have my bundt pan?

09:25.106 --> 09:26.106
Returned it.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.293
Where?
I looked under the counter.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.683
It's the right hand cupboard,
in the plastic. Yeah.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.560
Okay, well, we just sat down.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.655
All right, dear.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.820
So, I gotta go.

09:34.908 --> 09:35.908
Love to Rob and Teddy.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.512
All right, see you Sunday.
Love to dad.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.577
Talk to you later.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.972
Can you pretend to be
surprised about the cake?

09:39.996 --> 09:41.327
She wants it to be very special.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.239
Oh, and the granite samples
came in.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.853
Can you pick them up
on your way home tomorrow?

09:45.877 --> 09:47.333
Mmm. Rob?

09:47.587 --> 09:48.702
Hmm? Uh, sure.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.630
You okay?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.097
Yes.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.380
Bless us, our lord and thy gifts

10:00.475 --> 10:02.161
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty

10:02.185 --> 10:03.391
through Christ our lord. Amen.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.559
Thank you, god.
Thank you for our family.

11:04.831 --> 11:05.831
Thank you.

11:45.788 --> 11:50.202
Hi, grammers. What on earth!

11:52.337 --> 11:54.023
I tried to call,
but you weren't picking up.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.414
Alma: Oh, well, you know me.
My two fake knees.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.750
What are you doing here?

12:02.680 --> 12:05.763
A farmer came to see me.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.471
Wilbur tennant?

12:09.979 --> 12:11.185
You do know him.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.355
I don't socialize with him,
if that's what you mean.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.734
Inez Graham owned the farm
next to his.

12:19.322 --> 12:22.064
I used to take you and Beth over
there when you were little.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.281
That's the place?

12:38.299 --> 12:39.299
Hmm.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.841
You rode that pony. Ar!

12:44.514 --> 12:45.924
Rob: I loved that place.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.132
Alma: Saw a cow
for the first time.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.099
Learned to milk it.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.720
I remember
you sittin' there for hours

12:53.815 --> 12:56.272
making sure you got
every last drop.

12:56.818 --> 12:57.933
Just like you.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.779
There.

13:01.698 --> 13:02.698
Rob: Hmm.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.484
So you gonna help him?

13:05.493 --> 13:06.493
Huh?

13:55.168 --> 13:58.626
You come up the holler,
dump's up the hill.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.085
Since I started
complaining about my creek,

14:04.177 --> 14:06.543
fence goes up. All blocked off.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.845
Hi, I'm Rob.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.604
Sandra.

14:17.148 --> 14:21.187
Wilbur: The state, any veterinarian
I've called in parkersburg,

14:22.445 --> 14:24.527
they will not
return my phone calls.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.195
Like I bite the hand that feeds.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.442
No, it's all right. I've already...
This here's a gall.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.262
Look at the size of it.
Ain't never seen

14:30.286 --> 14:31.992
no gall that big.
Bigger than the heart.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.412
That your cows'?

14:34.499 --> 14:35.579
Look at them teeth.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.501
Black as night. Here.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.715
Hoof, all turned in on itself.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.794
Half my calves born
with hooves like that.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.599
Tumor, I done
cut off the back a heifer.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.266
How'd ya like
that on your table?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.181
Rob: What am I looking for?

15:03.277 --> 15:04.517
You blind, boy?

15:05.321 --> 15:07.903
Stones as white
as the hairs on my head.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.532
Bleached! That's chemicals,
I'm telling ya.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.245
My animals drink this water.
Cool off in 'er.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.666
Get them bloody welts,
them dead eyes.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.743
Charge at me, crazy-like.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.874
Animals that used to eat
out of my own hand.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.667
Rob: Where are the rest of them?

15:32.515 --> 15:33.595
Come on.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.442
Beginnin', I'd bury 'em.
Each one. They're family.

15:51.159 --> 15:54.196
It got to be so many,
pile 'em up, set fire to...

15:57.665 --> 15:59.872
How many did you lose?

16:00.501 --> 16:02.958
190.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.663
190 cows?

16:06.757 --> 16:08.668
You tell me
nothing's wrong here.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.885
And this landfill
wasn't always here?

16:20.605 --> 16:24.974
No. My brother Jim used to dig
ditches over at the dupont plant.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.600
Got sick, couldn't
do it no more.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.896
One day they come to him, offering to
buy his land right up that holler.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.191
They promised no chemicals.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.026
And I assume you
reached out to dupont?

16:37.121 --> 16:38.986
Dupont, the state, the feds.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.447
I called everybody
there is dozens of times.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.580
Epa finally comes out here.
Oh, they did.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.579
All for some report.
What did it say?

16:47.924 --> 16:49.380
You think they're gonna show me?

17:15.284 --> 17:16.444
Sarah: Okay.

17:20.623 --> 17:24.866
He's been like this all day.
Okay. Go on.

17:29.924 --> 17:32.006
Of course, you're
a perfect angel for daddy.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.133
Did you get the tile?
Um, I'm sorry. No.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.472
Rob.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.348
I didn't drive into town today.
I'm sorry.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.475
What do you mean
you didn't drive into town?

17:48.109 --> 17:49.565
I had to go to parkersburg.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.269
Parkersburg? Why'd you
have to go to parkersburg?

17:54.657 --> 17:56.648
I may have a client there.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.530
In West Virginia? What kind
of a case would you have?

18:01.581 --> 18:04.448
He's a farmer. He knows
my grammer. Not well, but...

18:05.167 --> 18:09.080
So, you saw her?
Was your mother there?

18:09.171 --> 18:12.413
Oh, come on, Sarah. I didn't
sneak off to see my mother.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.674
So, why did you sneak off?
I didn't.

18:18.681 --> 18:21.969
Our speaker tonight's no
stranger to the taft family.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.764
Phillip Donnelly, Phil to us,

18:26.188 --> 18:28.895
serves as in-house
corporate counsel at dupont.

18:29.692 --> 18:33.355
Not only one of America's most
revered chemical companies,

18:34.030 --> 18:36.942
but one of the few
giants of the industry

18:37.033 --> 18:40.241
that taft doesn't represent.
Not yet anyway!

18:40.745 --> 18:42.906
Managing partner:
That's the spirit, James.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.661
We asked Phil here tonight, not
just to show him what he's missing,

18:48.044 --> 18:51.286
but to hear how a renowned
leader of our industry

18:51.839 --> 18:55.798
stays that way.
Please welcome Phil Donnelly.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.387
Wish me luck. Go get 'em, Phil!

19:02.558 --> 19:06.050
At dupont, we're not producing
chemicals for chemical's sake.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.885
We're producing them
for people's sake.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.513
To make folks' lives easier.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.065
Happier, longer.

19:14.403 --> 19:18.612
That's why better living
through chemistry

19:19.450 --> 19:21.486
is not just a slogan at dupont.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.660
It's our DNA.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.583
Hey, Rob. Hello, Phil.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.078
Is it true what Tom tells me?
Yeah, it's true.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.533
Well, good on them. They're lucky
to have you. Thanks, Phil.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.457
Like I always tell
my younger associates,

19:38.552 --> 19:40.793
just keep your head down
and do the work.

19:40.888 --> 19:45.052
Thanks. Uh, Phil, can I ask
you sort of an odd question?

19:45.267 --> 19:46.473
Shoot.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.135
Does the name
wilbur tennant ring a bell?

19:50.398 --> 19:52.229
Tennet, did you say? Tennant.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.060
No. Not that I recall.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.767
Mr. tennant"s a farmer
from West Virginia.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.070
His property abuts one of
your landfills, dry run.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.818
And his cows
have been getting sick.

20:01.909 --> 20:05.993
He thinks possibly because of the runoff
from the landfill into his creek.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.820
You're kidding me.
How did this come to you?

20:07.915 --> 20:11.078
Kim: Hey, Phil!
He's a farmer. He's...

20:12.044 --> 20:14.080
My grandmother's
from parkersburg.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.253
Really? Washington works.
Great plant.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.873
Right. She knows the tennants.
So grandma's on your back?

20:18.968 --> 20:20.708
Something like that.
Anyway, uh...

20:21.971 --> 20:25.555
The farmer said the epa came out,
took a look around. I wondered...

20:25.725 --> 20:27.590
The name of the landfill again?
Dry run.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.721
Dry run. Dry...

20:30.062 --> 20:32.082
You know, that does ring a
bell, now that you mention it.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.937
We may have even sent
some folks out there.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.147
If I remember correctly,
help epa check it out.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.477
That's gotta be it. So, I'd love
to share whatever came of that

20:39.572 --> 20:41.608
with Mr. tennant.
Help settle his nerves.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.528
Absolutely. Soon as I'm back in
Wilmington, I'll take a look.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.493
Thanks, Phil. I really appreciate it.
Happy to do it.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.947
Now, let's get a drink and
toast you, my friend. You.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.032
Okay.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.458
Mr. tennant!

21:10.144 --> 21:13.011
Mr. tennant, I have the report.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.394
Sons of bitches! Who the
hell they think they are?

21:19.195 --> 21:21.186
Who gives them the right?
It's an evaluation.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.067
Evalu, hatchet job's what it is.

21:25.075 --> 21:28.238
I been farming my
entire life. Entire lifel

21:28.662 --> 21:31.529
you read that. You tell me
you recognize my farm.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.080
Mr. tennant... read it!

21:36.462 --> 21:38.999
"The herd health
investigation revealed

21:39.089 --> 21:41.375
"deficiency in herd management.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.674
"Including poor nutrition,

21:45.304 --> 21:49.889
"inadequate veterinary care
and lack of fly control."

21:50.100 --> 21:51.681
You see any flies here?

21:52.812 --> 21:53.892
It's snowing.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.349
Can't stop making excuses
for 'em, can you?

21:58.108 --> 22:00.941
It could be pests.
They consulted a vet.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.776
Whose vet? Dupont?

22:06.116 --> 22:09.825
Look at yourself. Swallowin' whole,
whatever they been feeding ya.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.152
Can't tell truth from lie.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.080
You even watch them tapes
I gave you?

22:15.167 --> 22:18.375
Sir, I am trying to help! Quiet.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.458
Trying to help. Stop movin'.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.509
Easy, now. Easy.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.470
Get in. Slow.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.209
Forgive me, girl.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.031
Jesus.

24:25.923 --> 24:28.123
Radio dj: Need something to
warm you up right about now?

24:28.550 --> 24:30.541
Well, how about this?

24:34.348 --> 24:39.058
Man:
Almost heaven, West Virginia

24:40.104 --> 24:45.940
blue Ridge mountains,
shenandoah river

24:47.361 --> 24:52.321
life is old there,
older than the trees

24:52.449 --> 24:57.489
younger than the mountains
blowing like the breeze

24:57.663 --> 25:03.033
country roads, take me home

25:03.419 --> 25:06.126
to the place...

25:06.463 --> 25:09.170
I belong

25:09.341 --> 25:12.003
West Virginia...

25:12.219 --> 25:14.881
Mountain mama

25:15.180 --> 25:17.296
take me home...

25:17.516 --> 25:22.476
Wilbur: This cow's eyes are cloudy
with pink eyes is what they'll call it.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.137
Anyway, her eyes are sunk
way back in her head.

25:25.899 --> 25:29.016
She's poor as a whippoorwill.

25:30.779 --> 25:35.443
And I'm gonna cut her open and
find out what caused her to die.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.946
Because I was feeding
her enough feed...

25:38.037 --> 25:40.403
That she should've gained weight
instead of losin' weight.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.072
This is what
her teeth looks like.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.660
That's the upper one.

25:47.838 --> 25:52.423
But this one here, I've never seen
anything like it in my lifetime.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.242
Even the veterinarian,
he admitted...

25:55.304 --> 25:58.888
He never saw anything like this
before in his life either.

26:08.776 --> 26:13.315
So, what are you
proposing we do?

26:13.489 --> 26:17.983
File a claim, trigger discovery and
find out what's in that landfill.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.988
You wanna sue dupont? Targeted.

26:22.122 --> 26:25.706
Property dispute. Routine stuff.
Not routine. Not around here.

26:25.793 --> 26:28.375
I know, but, Tom,
if you'd actually seen it.

26:28.462 --> 26:32.546
His farm is like a graveyard.
There's something very wrong.

26:32.633 --> 26:35.215
So, he should
hire a local lawyer.

26:35.302 --> 26:38.135
None of them will do it. They're
all terrified of dupont.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.424
Well, what does that tell you?
We know dupont.

26:41.183 --> 26:42.719
They're gonna wanna hear

26:42.810 --> 26:45.472
if some of their local guys
are screwing something up.

26:45.562 --> 26:48.554
Oh, so they're gonna
thank us for suing.

26:48.649 --> 26:50.185
Better us than the epa.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.933
I mean, new partners are supposed
to bring in business, right?

26:53.028 --> 26:55.440
So, your farmer
can swing 275 an hour?

26:55.531 --> 26:57.442
It'd be on contingency.

26:58.033 --> 27:01.070
Jesus. What are we,
coupon chasers now?

27:01.161 --> 27:04.904
It's a small matter for a family friend.
I'll get in and I'll get out.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.663
Help a guy that needs it.
Who? The farmer or you?

27:30.107 --> 27:32.018
Surgical. You hear me?

27:32.109 --> 27:33.440
Absolutely. Thank you.

27:35.946 --> 27:38.779
Phil: Come on, Rob. Of
course, I'm gonna take your call.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.774
Even though, I was,
I admit, a little surprised.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.284
I mean, getting
sued by taft law.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.829
It's not every day.
Or any day, frankly.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.331
I know. I'm sorry.

27:49.418 --> 27:52.910
Look, you and I are friends.
This is a minor issue.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.212
No reason it should get messy.

27:55.299 --> 27:59.133
Thank you. I totally agree. Yeah,
I'm putting you on speaker phone.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.422
So, you wanna know
if we violated our permits.

28:04.725 --> 28:05.760
Pretty much, yeah.

28:06.393 --> 28:09.009
Okay, then. I'll have our
guys send over anything...

28:09.104 --> 28:11.436
Related to hazardous wastes
at dry run.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.686
And I'll tell them to hurry
it up this time. How's that?

28:14.776 --> 28:18.314
Thank you. That sounds great. And
don't stress. I forgive you.

28:18.697 --> 28:19.732
Thanks, Phil.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.301
You took your baby
into the office?

28:43.388 --> 28:46.471
I needed a bigger trunk. Why?

28:47.100 --> 28:49.591
Discovery for the tennant
case came in today.

28:49.686 --> 28:54.680
Oh. Oh, you started before me.
You're so fast! Whoa.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.561
Good boy.

28:56.652 --> 28:58.563
Rob's missing such a lovely day.

28:59.529 --> 29:02.692
Law's a jealous mistress, mom.
Means it comes with the territory.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.114
Let's go over here!

29:04.451 --> 29:07.451
Sarah's brother: Nice! Thank you! That's
what I'm talking about right there.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.291
All right. Let's go. One more.
One more. All right.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.302
Poly...

29:33.480 --> 29:34.640
Is that...

29:51.456 --> 29:52.946
No.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.173
How's my favorite plaintiff's attorney?
Hey, help me out, will ya?

30:03.260 --> 30:05.626
You're a run of a mill
dump, nothing but trash.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.294
You sound like
my first girlfriend.

30:08.807 --> 30:13.016
Why a requisition order
for 55-gallon containers?

30:13.395 --> 30:15.681
Conspiracy. Standard size drums.

30:15.772 --> 30:20.812
Ash, ash-byproduct, glass tubing,
plastic, paper waste. It's just trash.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.853
You pile it onto a truck, drive it away.
You don't pack it into drums.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.355
So, they've got liquid waste.
Not hazardous.

30:26.825 --> 30:30.158
Or they'd have to disclose it.
So, what is killing these cows?

30:30.329 --> 30:32.741
It's not paper and ash. Well,
maybe it's human error.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.274
They're dumping something in
there they don't know is toxic.

30:35.625 --> 30:39.584
Kim, it's dupont. They know
more than the epa does.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.666
Everyone knows more
than the epa does.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.796
Why else would they
let us regulate ourselves?

30:46.136 --> 30:48.878
What? Do we?

30:49.097 --> 30:50.507
Do we what?

30:51.808 --> 30:54.891
The epa only started
regulating chemicals in '76.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.013
Yeah?

30:56.104 --> 30:59.688
They grandfather in every
existing chemical, non-hazardous,

30:59.775 --> 31:03.734
unless they knew it was hazardous
or a company told them it was.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.527
We're saying the same thing.
No, we're not. I'm saying

31:06.615 --> 31:10.107
what if a company didn't tell?

31:11.828 --> 31:13.534
What if

31:13.622 --> 31:17.410
the reason Phil Donnelly agreed
to discovery on hazardous

31:17.501 --> 31:19.116
is because he knows

31:19.753 --> 31:22.836
whatever's in that landfill
isn't even regulated?

31:23.215 --> 31:25.957
Okay, now you are sounding
like a plaintiff's attorney.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.167
I've got a meeting.
Hey, oh, wait, one second.

31:29.388 --> 31:33.176
Have you heard of this,
um, pfoa?

31:34.101 --> 31:35.216
No.

31:35.435 --> 31:38.723
You know, it's mentioned here, but
I can't find anything about it

31:38.814 --> 31:41.294
in any of the literature. I don't
even know if it's a chemical.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.850
Ask Phil. Well, thank you.

31:45.529 --> 31:48.249
Secretary: As I said, Mr.
Donnelly is still out of town.

31:48.323 --> 31:51.907
I called last week and left two messages
and haven't heard back from him.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.833
I'll be sure to tell him
that you called again.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.573
Okay. Damn it.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.330
Your tickets to the chemical
alliance dinner. Argh...

31:59.668 --> 32:02.455
And, no, dark suit is not
the same as black tie.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.127
Wouldn't he be going?

32:35.871 --> 32:39.034
I don't know if Rob told you, but
I was a receptionist at taft

32:39.124 --> 32:40.614
before law school.
Is that right?

32:40.709 --> 32:42.669
But well, I think the
right bilott ended up there.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.413
Harold, you're not
getting away from me.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.369
Would you excuse me?
Sure, it was...

32:46.465 --> 32:48.831
It's great to see you.
When is the...

32:48.925 --> 32:50.881
That's funny.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.343
Right away, I saw a little
of myself in Rob.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.630
Oh! One black sheep to another.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.094
My dad was a steel worker, you know.
Was he?

32:59.269 --> 33:01.180
Have you seen Phil?

33:01.730 --> 33:03.220
Kim: No.

33:03.523 --> 33:06.890
So, you're an attorney?
Oh, recovering.

33:07.194 --> 33:09.685
I represented employers
in workmen's comp disputes.

33:09.779 --> 33:12.020
But now, I stay at home
with our baby.

33:12.365 --> 33:14.902
Well, that's the thing
with lady lawyers.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.221
I wanna say hi to the dow folks.
Have you seen them?

33:17.245 --> 33:18.655
No, I've been looking for Phil.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.227
Did I tell you they
sent me some work?

33:20.332 --> 33:23.790
Dow? That's great! Just a small project.
Like a try-out.

33:23.877 --> 33:27.165
But if I impress them, can you
imagine if I brought on dow?

33:27.255 --> 33:29.792
None for me, thank you.

33:30.884 --> 33:31.919
You're not...

33:34.095 --> 33:35.095
I'm, uh...

33:36.348 --> 33:38.259
You're... she's...

33:38.350 --> 33:40.011
I'm...

33:40.101 --> 33:42.968
I'm gonna wait as long as I can
to tell the firm. Obviously.

33:43.063 --> 33:44.644
Would you excuse
us for a moment?

33:44.731 --> 33:46.813
These lady lawyers
need a quick sidebar.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.265
Of course. No. No.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.520
He signs your paycheck. Be nice to him.
Don't leave me.

33:52.989 --> 33:55.401
Sarah: Congratulations. Karla: I know.
I can't believe it.

34:01.331 --> 34:02.411
Excuse me.

34:12.133 --> 34:13.339
Phil: Rob, how are you?

34:13.426 --> 34:14.820
Phil, I've been
trying to reach you.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.739
So sorry, all this traveling. How
about I give you a shout tomorrow?

34:16.763 --> 34:18.616
We're gonna need to broaden
discovery to everything

34:18.640 --> 34:20.380
in that landfill,
hazardous or not.

34:24.563 --> 34:25.598
Excuse me.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.055
You kidding me?

34:28.149 --> 34:29.149
Rob: No.

34:31.653 --> 34:33.814
I think whatever's causing
the problems in there

34:33.905 --> 34:36.988
isn't something the epa
regulates or knows to regulate.

34:37.617 --> 34:38.617
Sorry?

34:38.702 --> 34:42.035
I'm seeing things in your
documents I don't understand.

34:42.122 --> 34:44.362
You're seeing ghosts, is what
you're seeing, and frankly,

34:44.416 --> 34:45.747
you're making an
ass of yourself.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.495
Okay, then, help me out.

34:47.586 --> 34:48.826
I mean, like this.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.162
I mean, what is this pfoa?

34:52.841 --> 34:54.502
What's that stand for?

34:56.344 --> 34:57.629
Jesus.

34:57.721 --> 35:00.007
You're on a goddamn
fishing expedition.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.097
You wanna flush your
career down the toilet

35:03.184 --> 35:04.219
for some cowhand?

35:04.311 --> 35:05.892
Be my guest. I'm
done helping you.

35:05.979 --> 35:08.436
Phil, I need to insist
on broadening discovery.

35:08.773 --> 35:09.808
Sue me! Uh...

35:10.900 --> 35:11.935
I'm already suing you.

35:12.027 --> 35:13.233
Dow lawyer: Welcome, everyone,

35:13.320 --> 35:16.778
to the 14th annual Ohio
chemical alliance...

35:16.865 --> 35:18.480
Fuck you! Awards dinner.

35:21.494 --> 35:22.529
Hick!

35:25.999 --> 35:28.991
Dow lawyer: So, let's
get the fun started!

35:49.939 --> 35:51.520
I'm sorry.

35:51.608 --> 35:53.564
Sarah: You're not the only
one who's sacrificed.

35:59.949 --> 36:02.136
I just hope
you know what you're doing.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.978
Tom: You know the difference between
business and pleasure, right?

36:11.002 --> 36:14.620
So, why on earth would you
engage in business conversations

36:14.714 --> 36:16.625
at a public function? Rob: Tom!

36:17.425 --> 36:19.962
He's hiding something.
You saw his reaction.

36:20.053 --> 36:21.839
Yeah, me and everyone
in that room.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.795
Taft in a pissing
match with dupont.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.801
I am gonna get a court
order and force them

36:25.892 --> 36:27.244
to tell me everything
that's in that landfill.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.600
Jesus Christ! Now you wanna
actually take them to court.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.724
And I'm gonna need local
counsel in West Virginia.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.396
What happened to routine stuff?

36:33.483 --> 36:35.348
Ask Phil Donnelly. God!

36:36.277 --> 36:37.557
Larry: Of course,
I remember you.

36:38.822 --> 36:41.108
Yeah, last time I saw you,
I think Phil Donnelly was

36:41.199 --> 36:43.485
trying to get you to go
out on the links with us.

36:43.576 --> 36:44.611
Yeah.

36:47.497 --> 36:48.532
You what?

37:02.429 --> 37:03.714
Sir. Thank you.

37:10.019 --> 37:11.019
Good morning.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.931
Good morning, Larry. Morning.

37:22.782 --> 37:23.782
Morning, miss Claire.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.737
Don't you look nice.

37:26.828 --> 37:28.238
Save it for the
judge, Mr. winter.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.991
Filing clerk:
You're suing dupont.

37:37.046 --> 37:38.081
Larry: Yes, ma'am.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.455
You represent dupont.

37:40.550 --> 37:41.550
My old firm did.

37:42.552 --> 37:43.952
I've been out on
my own for a while.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.920
Good luck with that.

37:51.478 --> 37:53.844
Phil: Just wanted to
let you know personally

37:53.938 --> 37:57.271
that your court-ordered
discovery is on the way.

37:57.358 --> 37:58.939
Thanks, Phil.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.109
Phil: No, it's my pleasure.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.528
Discovery.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.004
Son of a bitch.

38:22.091 --> 38:24.423
No admission of liability.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.964
And non...

38:29.390 --> 38:31.847
Non-disclosure of
any and all terms.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.760
Pardon me a moment.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.242
Thanks.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.945
Holy Jesus!

38:54.999 --> 38:56.330
What in the... thanks.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.375
World?

38:59.462 --> 39:01.544
I guess the joke's on me.

39:01.631 --> 39:02.631
Yeah.

39:04.092 --> 39:05.945
No one can go through all this crap.
Not in a million years.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.049
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's
what they're banking on.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.756
Oh, god! Damn it! Oh, god, Rob!

39:18.147 --> 39:21.230
Here, let me... no, no, no, you
shouldn't be around this stuff.

39:22.569 --> 39:25.481
You sure? I'm positive.
Thank you, though.

39:26.239 --> 39:27.274
Yeah.

39:28.783 --> 39:29.818
Good luck.

39:51.347 --> 39:52.803
1957.

40:57.372 --> 40:59.363
Man: Hey, Sally, what is
the hold up back here?

41:02.168 --> 41:03.808
Hey, Bobby. How you...
What're you having?

41:06.047 --> 41:07.047
Usual.

41:08.841 --> 41:10.547
Eggs over bacon and grits.

41:12.178 --> 41:13.213
Same.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.140
Bobby: I need two over,
grits, fried.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.221
Wilbur: Wilbur tennant.

41:31.364 --> 41:33.524
Kathleen: He's not in his office.
Can I take a message?

41:36.119 --> 41:38.201
But he really can't get
to the phone right now.

41:38.287 --> 41:39.572
I want service!

41:40.081 --> 41:42.441
I'll let him know that you called again.
For Christ's sakes.

41:44.877 --> 41:47.334
Is she getting accustomed
to being at mom and dad's?

41:47.422 --> 41:49.233
Beth: You know grammer.
She misses her own house.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.669
What? She misses her own house.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.046
I have a bad cell.

41:54.137 --> 41:56.378
I said grammer
misses her own house.

41:56.472 --> 41:57.928
Okay, can you...

41:58.349 --> 41:59.634
Can I talk to her?

41:59.726 --> 42:01.006
She and mom are at the doctor's.

42:01.686 --> 42:04.348
Will you tell grammers I called?
Rob, you're breaking up.

42:04.439 --> 42:05.519
And mom too?

42:05.606 --> 42:07.142
Let's try again on Sunday.
All right.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.190
"C-8."

42:23.458 --> 42:25.790
You know you look like
a crazy person, right?

42:25.877 --> 42:28.243
What was the name of that guy
that you brought by the...

42:28.671 --> 42:32.004
What guy? The chemistry expert.

42:32.091 --> 42:33.877
The guy who does the models.
Gillespie.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.055
Here you go.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.057
Thank you.

42:40.475 --> 42:42.215
Kim Burke
had an expense account.

42:42.852 --> 42:45.138
Oh, sorry. It's not
that kind of case.

42:45.897 --> 42:50.015
Are you familiar
with something called pfoa?

42:51.736 --> 42:52.771
No.

42:55.448 --> 42:56.779
No. No.

42:57.450 --> 43:01.989
I did read something recently
about a pfos, I think it was.

43:02.121 --> 43:05.079
That sounds related.
And what was that?

43:05.708 --> 43:08.666
Long-chain fluorocarbon,
synthetic.

43:09.796 --> 43:13.084
I'm sorry. Chemistry was
my worst class in high school.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.498
Boy, you in the wrong
line of work.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.959
Tell me about it. So?

43:18.387 --> 43:20.844
So, synthetic. All right?
Man-made.

43:21.933 --> 43:23.048
Frankenstein.

43:23.851 --> 43:24.931
And?

43:25.645 --> 43:29.729
Long-chain fluorocarbon is a sequence
of carbon atoms, add a fluoride.

43:30.983 --> 43:34.771
All right. In the lab you take
a carbon atom... mmm-hmm.

43:34.862 --> 43:38.025
And then you add
another carbon atom.

43:38.574 --> 43:39.574
And then another

43:40.409 --> 43:42.024
and another... look.

43:43.621 --> 43:46.363
You're making a chain. Right?

43:49.252 --> 43:51.243
Right? Could it be...

43:52.171 --> 43:54.127
Eight? Eight carbons?

43:54.215 --> 43:56.752
Well, sure. Yeah, in the lab
you can do almost anything.

43:57.468 --> 44:00.676
And why would you want to?
Make this, I mean.

44:02.723 --> 44:06.386
Well, a chain like that's pretty much
unbreakable, biochemically speaking.

44:06.477 --> 44:09.389
So, uh, industrial uses,
I imagine.

44:10.231 --> 44:11.641
3m made it.

44:12.150 --> 44:14.232
They don't anymore.
That's what I read.

44:14.777 --> 44:17.314
Why did they stop? Didn't say.

44:19.782 --> 44:20.782
What if...

44:22.451 --> 44:23.941
What if you drank it?

44:26.581 --> 44:27.581
Drank it?

44:28.583 --> 44:30.244
You don't.
Well, what if you did?

44:30.793 --> 44:32.909
Ready to order? Yeah,
I think I'd like a...

44:34.046 --> 44:35.206
But what if you did?

44:36.549 --> 44:39.086
That's like saying,
"what if I swallowed a tire?"

44:40.720 --> 44:43.132
I don't know. You wanna be
the guy that finds out?

44:44.807 --> 44:45.807
Tuna melt.

45:05.161 --> 45:10.201
Preacher: Let us all begin with hymn
number 452 in our hymnal books.

45:10.291 --> 45:13.249
"Here I am, lord." Please rise.

45:16.505 --> 45:21.044
All: I, the lord of sea and sky

45:21.135 --> 45:25.549
I have heard my people cry

45:26.057 --> 45:30.266
all who dwell in deepest sin

45:30.895 --> 45:34.228
my hand will save

45:36.484 --> 45:37.769
does it makes sounds?

45:38.778 --> 45:40.338
Female voice: Asteroid ahead.

45:40.571 --> 45:43.313
You hold like that.

45:43.407 --> 45:45.568
Male voice:
Are you ready to blast off?

45:58.881 --> 46:00.746
Teddy: I'm taking off that.

46:31.622 --> 46:32.987
Rob: You said it had fluoride?

46:33.791 --> 46:35.477
Dr. Gillespie: What?
Mr. bilott, it's Sunday.

46:35.501 --> 46:38.208
That chemical, you said
it had a fluoride atom.

46:39.755 --> 46:42.747
It's a fluorocarbon, so, yes.
Somewhere along the chain...

46:42.842 --> 46:45.208
What would it do to your
teeth if you drank it?

46:45.303 --> 46:47.385
Don't tell me if you
shouldn't, if you did.

46:47.471 --> 46:49.711
If you drank a lot of it, what
would it do to your teeth?

46:50.224 --> 46:52.510
Well, in trace amounts
fluoride hardens teeth.

46:52.601 --> 46:57.311
But too much, it's gonna stain 'em.
I mean, even turn 'em black.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.681
So, can I get back
to my family now?

47:05.323 --> 47:06.563
What? Where are you going?

47:06.991 --> 47:09.528
It's in their water.
What? What is?

47:47.198 --> 47:48.638
Doctor: How long's
the coughing been?

47:50.117 --> 47:52.699
Wilbur: Couple...
Couple of months.

47:53.245 --> 47:54.245
A year.

47:54.705 --> 47:58.323
You a smoker? No.

47:59.085 --> 48:01.005
Roll up your sleeve.
We're gonna take some blood.

48:15.601 --> 48:18.468
Thought you left him inside.
I did.

48:23.150 --> 48:24.390
Oh, baby.

48:34.203 --> 48:35.203
You move this?

48:36.163 --> 48:37.163
What?

48:37.248 --> 48:39.580
Did you go through this? No!

48:44.713 --> 48:45.713
They been here.

48:47.550 --> 48:48.585
They been here!

49:17.455 --> 49:18.570
What happened?

49:20.416 --> 49:21.416
Wash up.

49:30.718 --> 49:31.753
Crystal: Dad?

49:34.513 --> 49:35.548
What is it? Quiet.

49:45.858 --> 49:49.146
Wilbur: This is my land,
damn you! You get out of here!

49:49.904 --> 49:50.939
Go on!

49:52.406 --> 49:53.521
Go on!

49:55.242 --> 49:59.076
Sandra, girls, get on!
Go on, get in! Get in!

50:01.165 --> 50:02.496
I know you!

52:14.840 --> 52:15.875
Rob?

52:41.659 --> 52:45.072
Holy crap, Rob! What?

52:45.162 --> 52:47.949
I thought someone was
breaking in, for god's sakes!

52:48.040 --> 52:49.496
No, it's just me.

52:49.583 --> 52:51.663
Rob, you need to tell me
what in the hell's going on.

52:54.797 --> 52:56.128
We're being poisoned.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.419
Rob. What?

53:00.511 --> 53:04.174
I mean it. Dupont is
knowingly poisoning us.

53:04.264 --> 53:06.550
You mean the farmer. His land.

53:07.393 --> 53:08.473
All of us.

53:10.729 --> 53:12.139
Please don't look at me
like that.

53:13.691 --> 53:15.431
They're already poisoning
the baby.

53:17.277 --> 53:19.768
No. I'm not listening to this.
Sarah.

53:20.155 --> 53:21.770
Stop it! Just stop it, okay?

53:22.700 --> 53:25.442
Do you hear yourself? You are
acting like a crazy person.

53:25.536 --> 53:28.528
Tearing up our floor.
Scaring me half to death.

53:28.622 --> 53:31.238
I know it's my job to support
you, but that does not mean

53:31.333 --> 53:33.745
you get to come into our
home, to our family

53:33.836 --> 53:36.748
and tell me that our unborn
child is being poisoned. No!

53:36.839 --> 53:39.296
I'm sorry. Can I please explain?

53:39.383 --> 53:41.123
Explain what? All of it.

53:41.927 --> 53:46.011
And if you still think I'm crazy,
I'll drop it. I swear to god.

53:48.684 --> 53:49.890
I swear to you.

54:06.410 --> 54:08.366
There is a man-made chemical

54:10.205 --> 54:12.617
that was invented
during the Manhattan project.

54:13.667 --> 54:16.158
It repelled the elements,
especially water.

54:16.795 --> 54:21.129
So they used it to make the first
ever waterproof coating for tanks.

54:21.216 --> 54:22.581
It was indestructible.

54:22.676 --> 54:26.760
Then some companies thought,
"hey, why just the battlefield?

54:26.847 --> 54:30.715
"Why not bring this chemical
into American homes?"

54:30.934 --> 54:32.390
Rob's here.
Tom: All right. Good.

54:33.312 --> 54:34.312
He'll see you now.

54:38.317 --> 54:40.103
Rob: Dupont was one
of those companies.

54:41.862 --> 54:44.399
So they took
this chemical, pfoa.

54:45.199 --> 54:46.860
They renamed it c-8.

54:47.868 --> 54:50.530
And they made their own
impenetrable coating,

54:50.621 --> 54:53.237
but not for tanks. For pans.

54:54.875 --> 54:56.615
They called it teflon.

54:57.211 --> 55:00.624
A shining symbol
of American ingenuity,

55:00.714 --> 55:02.921
made right here in the usa,

55:03.008 --> 55:05.090
in parkersburg, West Virginia.

55:07.012 --> 55:09.219
But right from the start,
something wasn't right.

55:09.932 --> 55:13.095
The men, and workers
who made teflon

55:13.185 --> 55:15.676
were coming down
with nausea, fevers.

55:15.771 --> 55:17.181
Dupont wanted to know why.

55:17.856 --> 55:20.518
So they laced cigarettes
with teflon.

55:20.609 --> 55:23.100
They told a group of their
workers, "hey, smoke these."

55:23.904 --> 55:25.735
Duponters did as they were told.

55:27.282 --> 55:29.318
Almost all of those men
were hospitalized.

55:33.914 --> 55:35.450
That's 1962.

55:35.999 --> 55:39.958
One year after teflon launched
and already dupont knew.

55:40.587 --> 55:44.250
The dust, they just sent right up the
smoke stacks, released into the air.

55:45.050 --> 55:47.632
The sludge, tossed
it into the Ohio.

55:47.719 --> 55:51.928
Or, uh, packed into drums and
chucked it into the chesapeake.

55:52.724 --> 55:54.885
But then their drums
started washing up.

55:55.394 --> 55:57.806
So, dupont starts
digging ditches

55:57.896 --> 55:59.852
on the grounds
of the Washington works plant.

55:59.940 --> 56:02.181
And in those pits, they dumped

56:02.276 --> 56:05.860
thousands of tons
of toxic c-8 sludge and dust.

56:06.321 --> 56:09.063
One of the men that they hired
to dig those ditches

56:09.157 --> 56:11.819
was wilbur tennant's
brother Jim.

56:12.703 --> 56:15.035
But they weren't the only ones
covering their tracks.

56:15.581 --> 56:19.324
3m who pioneered these
chemicals for scotchgard,

56:19.418 --> 56:20.783
they were testing them
on monkeys.

56:21.336 --> 56:22.746
Most of the monkeys died.

56:23.380 --> 56:25.746
It wasn't like dupont
didn't know that because

56:25.841 --> 56:28.173
they were doing
their own tests on rats.

56:29.052 --> 56:30.667
Watched their organs balloon.

56:31.930 --> 56:33.761
Now the rats
are getting cancers.

56:34.391 --> 56:37.975
Tested them on pregnant rats
and watched them give birth

56:38.061 --> 56:40.347
to pups with deformed eyes.

56:41.064 --> 56:44.272
So, they yanked all the young
women off the teflon line

56:44.776 --> 56:46.016
and never told them why.

56:50.365 --> 56:55.029
Sue Bailey's job was scrubbing
these huge steel vats

56:55.120 --> 56:58.157
where they held the liquid c-8.
She was pregnant.

56:58.624 --> 57:00.706
I love youl! Would you stop?

57:02.836 --> 57:07.205
Rob: She gave birth to a baby with
one nostril and a deformed eye.

57:07.299 --> 57:10.837
Remember how dupont had seen
those deformities in the rats?

57:14.056 --> 57:15.592
Oh, god. What about his eyes?

57:16.141 --> 57:18.223
Blue. Just like all newborns.

57:18.310 --> 57:20.676
But they're normal,
the lids, the pupils?

57:20.771 --> 57:24.229
Mr. bilott, relax. He's perfect.

57:25.025 --> 57:27.186
Hey. Hi, Charlie.

57:27.277 --> 57:29.859
Rob: So sue goes to dupont.

57:29.947 --> 57:32.689
She says, "why did you pull me
off the teflon line?

57:33.492 --> 57:38.111
"Did c-8 make my baby this
way?" "No," they tell her.

57:38.205 --> 57:42.539
Then all of her records from
her time at teflon disappear.

57:42.626 --> 57:47.336
One year later, they put all
of the women back on teflon

57:47.422 --> 57:50.164
and never say a thing.

57:56.807 --> 57:57.807
He's here.

58:02.062 --> 58:03.768
Rob: Dupont knew everything.

58:04.773 --> 58:08.231
They knew that the c-8
they put into the air

58:08.318 --> 58:10.309
and buried into the
ground for decades

58:10.404 --> 58:12.065
was causing cancers.

58:12.155 --> 58:15.898
They knew that their own workers
were getting these cancers.

58:15.993 --> 58:19.030
They knew that the consumers
too were being exposed

58:19.121 --> 58:22.454
and not just in teflon.
In paints,

58:22.916 --> 58:27.205
in fabrics, in,
uh, raincoats, boots.

58:28.839 --> 58:30.295
To this day...

58:32.342 --> 58:36.460
Rob: For 40 years you knew
c-8 was poison.

58:36.555 --> 58:39.968
You knew the "happy pan"
was a ticking time bomb.

58:40.559 --> 58:43.096
And you knew exactly why.

58:43.270 --> 58:45.511
Because c-8,
it stays in us forever.

58:48.942 --> 58:53.185
And knowing all of this,
still you did nothing because

58:53.780 --> 58:56.021
doing something,

58:56.908 --> 58:59.866
"would essentially
put the long-term viability

58:59.953 --> 59:03.946
"of this product's segment
on the line."

59:06.710 --> 59:08.996
You were making too much money.

59:09.921 --> 59:13.129
One billion dollars a year just
in profits, just in teflon.

59:14.426 --> 59:17.964
And so you pumped
millions more pounds

59:18.055 --> 59:21.218
of toxic c-8 into the air,
into the water

59:21.475 --> 59:24.467
so much so you could
actually see it foam.

59:25.312 --> 59:30.773
C-8 was everywhere. There was nowhere
left for you to contaminate.

59:34.905 --> 59:37.066
And that's when
they came to Jim.

59:37.741 --> 59:41.359
They knew he was sick and needed the
money and they needed his land.

59:42.079 --> 59:45.196
And when they got it,
they dug up all the c-8

59:45.373 --> 59:48.160
from every single pit
at Washington works.

59:48.251 --> 59:51.584
Fourteen million pounds
of toxic c-8 sludge

59:51.797 --> 59:55.005
and they dumped it, again.
This time right up there.

59:55.175 --> 59:58.167
Steps from your creek,
from your house.

59:59.012 --> 1:00:02.129
That's what your cows
have been drinking, Earl.

1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:08.727
Put 'em behind bars.

1:00:08.814 --> 1:00:10.520
Whole damn lot of 'em,
right in jail.

1:00:10.690 --> 1:00:12.021
I understand, believe me.

1:00:12.109 --> 1:00:15.101
But this is a civil case. The
most we can hope for is damages.

1:00:15.237 --> 1:00:19.230
Don't want no money!
Whole damn world need...

1:00:25.580 --> 1:00:28.572
Needs to see what they done.
You're right. They should.

1:00:30.168 --> 1:00:32.750
And it kills me that they won't.

1:00:33.797 --> 1:00:36.379
But that would mean
going to trial

1:00:36.550 --> 1:00:38.962
and proving
that c-8 killed your cows.

1:00:39.136 --> 1:00:41.673
And every scientist who knows
anything about any of this

1:00:41.847 --> 1:00:43.838
already works
for these chemical companies.

1:00:43.974 --> 1:00:46.386
That's not an accident, Earl.

1:00:46.977 --> 1:00:52.142
Earl, these companies, they have
all the money all the time,

1:00:52.232 --> 1:00:53.688
and they'll use it. Trust me.

1:00:53.817 --> 1:00:55.557
I know. I was one of them.

1:00:57.028 --> 1:00:59.440
You're still one of 'em.

1:01:02.576 --> 1:01:06.819
You can't be serious. You know
what I put on the line here?

1:01:06.997 --> 1:01:10.160
You want a prize? Some medal
'cause for once in your life

1:01:10.250 --> 1:01:12.662
you took the side
of the little guy?

1:01:13.086 --> 1:01:16.328
Sorry, no prize. All you get is
your share of this blood money.

1:01:16.631 --> 1:01:19.464
And you sleep real good tonight.
Talk to your family.

1:01:19.926 --> 1:01:22.167
It ain't just my cows
was poisoned.

1:01:22.262 --> 1:01:24.423
What do you think
I fed my family on?

1:01:24.639 --> 1:01:27.756
Wilbur, please.

1:01:29.352 --> 1:01:31.513
Leave this place!

1:01:32.856 --> 1:01:36.599
Start over. Give your family
a fighting chance!

1:01:36.776 --> 1:01:38.767
Too late for that.

1:01:41.698 --> 1:01:44.030
We got it, Sandra and me.
The cancer.

1:01:45.744 --> 1:01:47.735
Surprise, surprise.

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:45.500
Sarah: In here.

1:02:51.559 --> 1:02:53.345
How'd it go?

1:02:55.522 --> 1:02:56.762
What's wrong?

1:02:57.607 --> 1:02:59.063
Rob?

1:02:59.901 --> 1:03:00.901
Rob, what is it?

1:03:06.866 --> 1:03:08.572
Sarah: What happened?
What happened?

1:03:09.202 --> 1:03:11.193
Oh, honey, honey, honey.

1:03:12.956 --> 1:03:15.368
Sarah: You saw a man hurting and

1:03:17.043 --> 1:03:19.455
you did the Christian thing.
You helped him.

1:03:19.963 --> 1:03:24.377
How? How?
Either he dies penniless

1:03:24.551 --> 1:03:27.509
or he lets dupont just keep
pillaging his community.

1:03:27.595 --> 1:03:29.005
How is that helping?

1:03:33.351 --> 1:03:35.342
Gotta get some sleep.

1:03:47.073 --> 1:03:50.031
I can't believe a freaking case
settlement could shut this up.

1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:55.362
Have you read their
confidentiality agreements?

1:03:56.249 --> 1:03:58.865
You've uncovered
a threat to the public.

1:03:59.461 --> 1:04:01.702
This goes beyond lawyering.

1:04:01.796 --> 1:04:04.082
That's... that's all
I know is lawyering.

1:04:04.174 --> 1:04:06.415
Fine. Then be the lawyer.

1:04:06.968 --> 1:04:08.458
You know dupont
better than anyone.

1:04:08.636 --> 1:04:09.876
What haven't they thought of?

1:05:09.823 --> 1:05:11.779
God. Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1:05:12.283 --> 1:05:13.283
What is that?

1:05:13.368 --> 1:05:16.201
Rob: Uh, a memo
and 136 exhibits.

1:05:49.112 --> 1:05:51.023
Rob: Wil, Sandra,
this is your copy.

1:06:11.676 --> 1:06:15.339
The epa announced a public hearing
into this family of chemicals

1:06:15.430 --> 1:06:17.921
I've been looking into.
I heard about it from Tucker.

1:06:18.183 --> 1:06:20.390
Tom: Monsanto Tucker?
Union carbide now.

1:06:20.518 --> 1:06:21.558
He says to me, "is it true

1:06:21.603 --> 1:06:23.139
"that a taft lawyer sent a
phone book's

1:06:23.229 --> 1:06:24.665
"worth of confidential
dupont documents

1:06:24.689 --> 1:06:26.270
"to the entire
federal government?"

1:06:26.357 --> 1:06:28.939
Internal documents, not confidential.
Very different.

1:06:29.027 --> 1:06:31.109
So you're testifying.
Rob: I signed up to testify.

1:06:31.196 --> 1:06:32.196
And the next thing I hear

1:06:32.280 --> 1:06:34.271
is dupont has petitioned a judge

1:06:34.365 --> 1:06:37.027
to stop me from testifying,
from flying to d.C,

1:06:37.118 --> 1:06:38.179
from even picking up the phone

1:06:38.203 --> 1:06:39.283
they filed for a gag order.

1:06:39.370 --> 1:06:41.110
Yes! This is what
we're up against.

1:06:41.206 --> 1:06:42.446
Jesus. Tom: David.

1:06:42.540 --> 1:06:43.601
Come on, Tom.
What do you expect?

1:06:43.625 --> 1:06:44.705
Where do we stand?

1:06:44.792 --> 1:06:46.623
Well, the judge rejected
the gag order,

1:06:46.711 --> 1:06:48.201
so I fly out Monday.

1:06:48.671 --> 1:06:52.163
Nice. I guess we'll
just watch on c-span.

1:06:54.469 --> 1:06:55.959
You ever do
anything like this again,

1:06:56.054 --> 1:06:59.717
I will cut your balls off and
serve them to dupont myself.

1:07:00.099 --> 1:07:01.509
Get out of here.

1:07:04.521 --> 1:07:05.886
Good luck in Washington.

1:07:07.148 --> 1:07:08.433
Thanks, Tom.

1:07:08.942 --> 1:07:12.730
Rob: This material
is a perfluoro...

1:07:12.904 --> 1:07:14.735
Or a pfoa.

1:07:14.906 --> 1:07:18.364
It's also known as fc 143,

1:07:19.327 --> 1:07:22.569
ammonium perfluorooctanoates.

1:07:22.664 --> 1:07:27.408
It has been shown
by dupont's own science

1:07:28.461 --> 1:07:30.577
that pfoa c-8

1:07:31.589 --> 1:07:35.673
is possibly life threatening
to human health.

1:07:36.094 --> 1:07:41.634
We are asking this agency
to do something.

1:08:02.370 --> 1:08:04.611
The presidential election
in four decades.

1:08:04.789 --> 1:08:06.529
Just look at these latest polls.

1:08:07.041 --> 1:08:08.681
Joe: Did you forget
to pay the water bill?

1:08:09.586 --> 1:08:10.746
Darlene: What?

1:08:10.837 --> 1:08:12.919
You forget to pay
the water bill?

1:08:14.549 --> 1:08:15.880
No.

1:08:16.718 --> 1:08:18.083
We got a notice.

1:08:18.636 --> 1:08:19.842
What's it say?

1:08:21.931 --> 1:08:24.843
"Pfoa is a persistent chemical

1:08:24.934 --> 1:08:26.470
"that is slow to be eliminated

1:08:26.561 --> 1:08:29.928
"from the blood stream of people
who have been exposed to it.

1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:32.180
"The dupont company has advised

1:08:32.275 --> 1:08:35.517
"the lubeck water district
that low concentrations

1:08:35.612 --> 1:08:38.570
"have been found
in the district's Wells.

1:08:38.656 --> 1:08:39.936
"Dupont has advised the district

1:08:39.991 --> 1:08:43.028
"that it is confident
these levels are safe."

1:08:44.203 --> 1:08:46.034
What the hell does that mean?

1:08:47.874 --> 1:08:49.785
Joe: A letter came last fall.

1:08:50.376 --> 1:08:52.662
James: Made no sense to me,
so I started making calls.

1:08:52.754 --> 1:08:55.040
Darlene: I told Joe don't
kick that hornet's nest.

1:08:55.673 --> 1:08:58.289
It's not like we didn't know
what we'd signed up for.

1:08:59.594 --> 1:09:00.709
Sarah: What do you mean?

1:09:01.471 --> 1:09:03.462
Oh, I was married before Joe

1:09:04.182 --> 1:09:06.093
to a chemist at dupont.

1:09:06.643 --> 1:09:08.429
Dream job. Paid real well.

1:09:08.519 --> 1:09:11.511
And the perks!
Presents for no reason.

1:09:11.606 --> 1:09:15.064
We'd get this catalogue.
Just pick whatever you want.

1:09:16.027 --> 1:09:17.312
And little stuff.

1:09:17.403 --> 1:09:18.813
Like he'd bring home this soap,

1:09:18.905 --> 1:09:20.486
this miracle powder.

1:09:20.573 --> 1:09:22.613
You put it in the washing
machine or the dishwasher,

1:09:22.700 --> 1:09:24.660
just wipes stuff clean
like you would not believe.

1:09:25.662 --> 1:09:28.119
One day he comes home and says,

1:09:28.206 --> 1:09:29.946
"can't bring that stuff
home no more."

1:09:30.041 --> 1:09:31.781
"Why?" won't tell me.

1:09:32.126 --> 1:09:34.333
Then he'd get sick for weeks.

1:09:35.129 --> 1:09:37.211
The teflon flu,
the guys would call it.

1:09:37.965 --> 1:09:40.081
We knew something wasn't right.

1:09:40.593 --> 1:09:43.426
But this house,
we bought it just by

1:09:43.513 --> 1:09:46.596
showing the bank
my husband's dupont ID.

1:09:46.683 --> 1:09:49.971
Put both our kids
through college. Engineers.

1:09:51.604 --> 1:09:54.311
In this town, that doesn't
come without a price.

1:09:54.649 --> 1:09:57.356
My brother Kenny
didn't know that price.

1:09:57.527 --> 1:09:59.563
He joined dupont at 19.

1:09:59.654 --> 1:10:01.986
Died on the operating table
two years later.

1:10:02.448 --> 1:10:05.531
Ulcerative colitis. Darlene:
Just like Dan Schiller had.

1:10:05.618 --> 1:10:06.903
Who's Dan?

1:10:07.078 --> 1:10:09.694
Darlene: A chemist at dupont.
Worked with my ex-husband.

1:10:10.164 --> 1:10:12.906
Joe: And Roger, what's his name?

1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.490
Darlene: Wilkins, the foreman.

1:10:14.627 --> 1:10:16.868
Steven gellar. Randy field.

1:10:16.963 --> 1:10:19.579
Randy's was kidney cancer.
He survived.

1:10:19.674 --> 1:10:22.211
His wife didn't.
No, June's was thyroid.

1:10:22.301 --> 1:10:23.882
It was supposed to be treatable.

1:10:24.262 --> 1:10:25.593
They didn't catch it in time.

1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:27.921
But they caught it in their son.

1:10:29.976 --> 1:10:32.058
Rob: Were your children
born healthy?

1:10:32.145 --> 1:10:34.181
Yes. Yes, they were. Good.

1:10:34.355 --> 1:10:38.268
But we wanted
a third and couldn't.

1:10:38.359 --> 1:10:39.565
I went to my doctor.

1:10:39.652 --> 1:10:42.359
He says, "you need a hysterectomy.
You need it right away."

1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:45.400
I'm so sorry.

1:10:45.491 --> 1:10:47.072
Bad luck, I guess.

1:10:48.786 --> 1:10:50.151
I was 36.

1:10:51.581 --> 1:10:52.787
Rob: Mr. kiger,

1:10:52.874 --> 1:10:55.081
you think I could get
a copy of that letter?

1:11:07.597 --> 1:11:09.553
What's wrong with your hand?

1:11:09.932 --> 1:11:12.093
Nothing. It's fine.

1:11:17.106 --> 1:11:18.971
Whoa, Rob?

1:11:21.110 --> 1:11:22.816
Rob, what are you doing?

1:11:24.781 --> 1:11:27.022
I mean, it's not enough
to poison these people?

1:11:27.116 --> 1:11:28.526
They gotta swindle them too?

1:11:28.618 --> 1:11:30.154
Okay, calm down. All right?

1:11:30.244 --> 1:11:31.950
Dupont wrote that letter!

1:11:32.038 --> 1:11:33.994
Not the water authority.
How do you know that?

1:11:34.081 --> 1:11:36.697
You think I don't know what a
dupont letter looks like by now?

1:11:36.793 --> 1:11:38.124
Okay. Okay.

1:11:38.586 --> 1:11:39.746
I mean, Jesus!

1:11:39.837 --> 1:11:41.543
It's evil, Sarah.

1:11:41.631 --> 1:11:43.587
It's fucking evil!

1:11:43.674 --> 1:11:45.835
What's fack?

1:11:46.761 --> 1:11:47.876
Perfect.

1:11:47.970 --> 1:11:49.730
It's nothing, sweetie.
It's nothing. Oh, boy.

1:11:49.806 --> 1:11:51.467
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey.

1:11:51.557 --> 1:11:52.993
Can you give
Charlie the bottle, please?

1:11:53.017 --> 1:11:55.554
Where's his bottle?
It's in the bag.

1:11:55.645 --> 1:11:57.886
What is all this?
It's from grammer's.

1:11:58.272 --> 1:12:00.354
It was left in her mailbox.

1:12:00.858 --> 1:12:02.894
"Medical claims, now and forever"?
Here, bud.

1:12:02.985 --> 1:12:04.441
"Now and forever."
Is that that...

1:12:04.570 --> 1:12:05.605
That...

1:12:06.364 --> 1:12:08.355
Medical monitoring. Is that...

1:12:10.034 --> 1:12:12.446
I thought you said
that wasn't gonna pass?

1:12:14.705 --> 1:12:17.572
Tom: Morning. David: Guys.

1:12:24.006 --> 1:12:26.918
Rob: Our lead plaintiff
is Mr. Joe kiger.

1:12:27.009 --> 1:12:30.593
Potential plaintiff,
if the partnership approves.

1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:33.012
Mr. Joe kiger, a phys ed teacher

1:12:33.099 --> 1:12:35.215
from parkersburg, West Virginia.

1:12:35.309 --> 1:12:39.803
On behalf of
the 70,000 local residents,

1:12:39.897 --> 1:12:42.764
whose water
dupont knowingly poisoned

1:12:42.859 --> 1:12:44.190
for the last 40 years.

1:12:44.277 --> 1:12:45.277
A class action?

1:12:45.361 --> 1:12:46.521
Let him finish.

1:12:46.612 --> 1:12:48.352
The kigers were notified

1:12:48.447 --> 1:12:51.780
by their local water company
that dupont had found

1:12:51.868 --> 1:12:55.656
small concentrations of c-8
in their water supply,

1:12:55.746 --> 1:12:57.202
but not to worry

1:12:57.290 --> 1:13:00.657
because those concentrations
were safe.

1:13:00.751 --> 1:13:03.663
Why? Because dupont said so.

1:13:08.009 --> 1:13:10.295
This is what dupont
considers safe.

1:13:10.678 --> 1:13:13.169
That's something like
one drop of water

1:13:13.264 --> 1:13:15.346
in an olympic size
swimming pool.

1:13:15.433 --> 1:13:17.924
In other words,
even a trace of c-8

1:13:18.019 --> 1:13:19.930
renders water unsafe.

1:13:20.021 --> 1:13:22.353
But dupont told
the local water authority,

1:13:23.566 --> 1:13:25.557
"your Wells have got even
less than that."

1:13:25.651 --> 1:13:27.733
Except that was a lie. A lie?

1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:30.436
Yes. Dupont has been
secretly testing

1:13:30.531 --> 1:13:31.862
these Wells for decades.

1:13:31.949 --> 1:13:34.907
They knew they had
contaminated those Wells

1:13:34.994 --> 1:13:37.906
up to six times that level.

1:13:37.997 --> 1:13:40.659
And thanks to the tennant
case, now we know too.

1:13:40.750 --> 1:13:43.366
David: Hold on. This stuff
is unregulated, right?

1:13:43.461 --> 1:13:44.997
I mean, as far as
epa's concerned,

1:13:45.087 --> 1:13:47.123
it might as well be Rose petals.

1:13:47.214 --> 1:13:49.455
The epa hasn't
set a standard, that's true,

1:13:49.550 --> 1:13:51.211
but dupont did.

1:13:51.427 --> 1:13:54.260
And all the law requires
to win a case like this,

1:13:54.347 --> 1:13:56.588
is to show that dupont exceeded

1:13:56.682 --> 1:13:59.219
what dupont itself
considers safe.

1:13:59.435 --> 1:14:00.595
Self-regulation.

1:14:00.728 --> 1:14:02.664
Managing partner: If what you're
saying is right... it is right.

1:14:02.688 --> 1:14:06.055
Then why would dupont tell this
water district anything at all?

1:14:06.150 --> 1:14:07.606
Seems to me that they're being

1:14:07.693 --> 1:14:09.433
a good corporate citizen here.

1:14:09.862 --> 1:14:12.854
That's how long
you have to file suit.

1:14:13.282 --> 1:14:14.567
One year from the moment

1:14:14.659 --> 1:14:17.196
you realize your water's
been contaminated.

1:14:17.662 --> 1:14:21.746
This letter looks like it's telling
people their water is safe.

1:14:21.832 --> 1:14:24.995
In fact, it's notifying them
that it isn't.

1:14:25.086 --> 1:14:26.747
Dupont has started the clock.

1:14:27.129 --> 1:14:28.244
David: Smart.

1:14:28.839 --> 1:14:29.954
We would've counseled that.

1:14:30.049 --> 1:14:32.085
Rob: It was sent 11 months ago.

1:14:32.176 --> 1:14:34.633
The moment they realized
we knew.

1:14:35.304 --> 1:14:37.511
In 30 days, they're home free.

1:14:37.598 --> 1:14:40.180
So that's the proposed
case in brief.

1:14:40.267 --> 1:14:42.007
But there's something else
to consider.

1:14:42.103 --> 1:14:43.343
Partner: You think?

1:14:43.646 --> 1:14:44.726
Rob.

1:14:44.814 --> 1:14:47.726
C-8 bio-accumulates.
It builds up inside of us.

1:14:48.109 --> 1:14:50.395
Some class members
who aren't sick today

1:14:51.654 --> 1:14:53.110
will get sick tomorrow.

1:14:53.197 --> 1:14:55.939
We need a way to protect
them into the future.

1:14:56.033 --> 1:14:58.136
Jesus, Tom! If you're even thinking
about using medical monitoring...

1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:00.492
Hold on. Hold on.

1:15:00.579 --> 1:15:04.197
Medical monitoring
is a claim now permitted

1:15:04.291 --> 1:15:05.497
in West Virginia courts.

1:15:05.584 --> 1:15:07.540
Partner: Oh, come on.
Let's hear him out.

1:15:07.628 --> 1:15:10.290
It say if a company
exposes a community

1:15:10.381 --> 1:15:11.996
to something
that makes them sick,

1:15:12.091 --> 1:15:15.299
they must monitor the health of
that community indefinitely.

1:15:15.386 --> 1:15:19.254
Everybody get that? You're creating
liability from mere exposure.

1:15:19.348 --> 1:15:21.054
It's also unprecedented.

1:15:21.142 --> 1:15:23.258
Exactly! Which is why
not six months ago,

1:15:23.352 --> 1:15:25.013
we fought tooth and nail
against it.

1:15:25.104 --> 1:15:27.811
And you lost.
Our clients have the right

1:15:27.898 --> 1:15:29.729
to avail themselves of the law.

1:15:29.817 --> 1:15:32.308
Potential clients.

1:15:36.490 --> 1:15:37.490
James: Okay.

1:15:38.117 --> 1:15:41.405
I know you, Rob.
I know your passion.

1:15:42.163 --> 1:15:44.404
You got a great settlement
for your farmer.

1:15:44.498 --> 1:15:45.829
You should be proud of that.

1:15:46.792 --> 1:15:50.376
And perhaps as the newest
partner at this table,

1:15:50.463 --> 1:15:51.999
I should be more circumspect.

1:15:52.089 --> 1:15:56.173
But what he's proposing here is

1:15:56.802 --> 1:15:59.043
nothing less than a shakedown

1:15:59.138 --> 1:16:02.130
of an iconic American company.
We do not represent dupont.

1:16:02.224 --> 1:16:04.306
No, you don't represent anyone.

1:16:05.978 --> 1:16:07.809
Is this what we have become?

1:16:07.897 --> 1:16:10.639
Plaintiff's attorneys.
Ambulance chasers.

1:16:10.733 --> 1:16:12.653
Why don't you just admit it?
Rob, you wanna flip.

1:16:12.735 --> 1:16:14.851
You wanna take everything
that you know

1:16:14.945 --> 1:16:17.357
about how
chemical companies operate

1:16:17.448 --> 1:16:19.905
and turn it against dupont.
Like an informant.

1:16:19.992 --> 1:16:21.178
That's enough.
James: Isn't that right?

1:16:21.202 --> 1:16:22.533
Tom: Okay! Isn't that right?

1:16:22.620 --> 1:16:23.985
Isn't that right? Yes.

1:16:24.538 --> 1:16:27.951
Okay, then, I...
I say we take a vote

1:16:28.042 --> 1:16:30.158
and determine whether or not

1:16:30.252 --> 1:16:31.742
we continue in the tradition

1:16:31.837 --> 1:16:34.169
that has distinguished this
firm from everyone else...

1:16:34.256 --> 1:16:36.713
Tom: Okay, I'm running
this meeting. Okay?

1:16:37.384 --> 1:16:38.384
You got that?

1:16:39.386 --> 1:16:41.047
Has anyone even read
the evidence

1:16:41.138 --> 1:16:42.218
this man has collected?

1:16:43.432 --> 1:16:45.718
The willful negligence,
the corruption?

1:16:47.186 --> 1:16:48.186
Read it!

1:16:48.979 --> 1:16:50.979
And then tell me we should
be sitting on our asses!

1:16:51.649 --> 1:16:55.517
That's the reason
why Americans hate lawyers.

1:16:56.320 --> 1:16:59.357
This is the crap that fuels
the Ralph naders of the world.

1:16:59.448 --> 1:17:02.155
We should want to nail dupont.

1:17:03.035 --> 1:17:04.991
All of us should!

1:17:05.079 --> 1:17:07.286
American business is better
than this, gentlemen.

1:17:07.373 --> 1:17:09.989
And when it's not,
we should hold them to it.

1:17:10.084 --> 1:17:12.166
That's how you build
faith in the system.

1:17:13.546 --> 1:17:16.288
We're always arguing
that companies are people.

1:17:17.341 --> 1:17:20.799
Well, these people
have crossed the line!

1:17:21.929 --> 1:17:23.590
To hell with them!

1:17:27.309 --> 1:17:28.799
Harry: It may come as a surprise

1:17:28.894 --> 1:17:31.806
to corporate defense types
like yourselves,

1:17:31.897 --> 1:17:33.762
but there's more to the law
than just flooding

1:17:33.858 --> 1:17:35.439
the other side in papers.

1:17:35.526 --> 1:17:38.734
From where I sit,
you have to touch people.

1:17:39.488 --> 1:17:41.399
These girls,
they handle the calls

1:17:41.490 --> 1:17:43.651
from the class action members.

1:17:43.742 --> 1:17:46.199
And there's thousands of 'em
on any given case.

1:17:46.829 --> 1:17:49.912
And it's here that we come
to know their pain.

1:17:49.999 --> 1:17:51.535
Isn't that right, Hazel?

1:17:51.625 --> 1:17:54.913
Yes. We hear it every day

1:17:55.004 --> 1:17:58.167
and it's my job to make
a jury feel that pain.

1:17:58.257 --> 1:18:00.748
Not out of pity,
but out of fear.

1:18:01.302 --> 1:18:03.634
Whatever it is
that happened to my client,

1:18:03.721 --> 1:18:05.507
that juror has to think,

1:18:06.557 --> 1:18:08.093
"that could happen to me."

1:18:08.267 --> 1:18:09.677
Rob: You just keep hammering it.

1:18:09.768 --> 1:18:11.929
One part per billion.
One part per billion.

1:18:12.021 --> 1:18:14.433
It's their own documents.
Their own scientists.

1:18:14.523 --> 1:18:15.558
Harry: Absolutely.

1:18:15.649 --> 1:18:18.061
Rob: They set that standard,
they have to live with it.

1:18:18.152 --> 1:18:20.143
Harry: Yeah, I think
we can relax, Rob,

1:18:20.237 --> 1:18:23.479
though, there's no way they're gonna
prevail with a motion to dismiss.

1:18:23.574 --> 1:18:25.155
This is procedural.

1:18:25.492 --> 1:18:27.403
It's nonsense.
We'll get a trial today.

1:18:30.122 --> 1:18:32.363
Rob: Okay, I'll catch
you guys in there.

1:18:35.961 --> 1:18:37.292
Wilbur: I wouldn't drink that.

1:18:40.883 --> 1:18:41.883
Earl.

1:18:44.011 --> 1:18:45.217
How ya doing?

1:18:46.222 --> 1:18:47.428
Still here.

1:18:49.266 --> 1:18:50.676
That's somethin', right?

1:18:51.810 --> 1:18:53.596
Yes, that's something.

1:18:54.563 --> 1:18:55.803
Sandra: Good to see ya, Robbie.

1:18:59.485 --> 1:19:00.725
Can't let 'em

1:19:02.238 --> 1:19:03.444
shut you down.

1:19:05.449 --> 1:19:07.906
I won't. I promise.

1:19:08.702 --> 1:19:10.033
Whole world

1:19:11.705 --> 1:19:13.411
needs to know.

1:19:15.542 --> 1:19:18.249
They will, Earl. They will.

1:19:20.339 --> 1:19:23.206
Hey, Rob? It's time.

1:19:25.594 --> 1:19:27.334
I have to go.

1:19:43.779 --> 1:19:45.394
We are here
on defendant's motion

1:19:45.489 --> 1:19:49.107
to dismiss the case
brought by Mr. kiger, et al.

1:19:50.369 --> 1:19:54.078
Now, which one of you
is Mr. Wallace?

1:19:54.832 --> 1:19:56.447
Edward Wallace, your honor,

1:19:56.542 --> 1:19:59.079
on behalf of the e.I.
Dupont de nemours and company,

1:19:59.169 --> 1:20:00.625
better known as dupont.

1:20:00.754 --> 1:20:02.244
Yes, I've heard of it.

1:20:02.339 --> 1:20:04.000
Your motion. Thank you.

1:20:05.009 --> 1:20:08.877
Your honor, we're here today because
of a uniquely American invention.

1:20:09.638 --> 1:20:10.638
Teflon.

1:20:11.098 --> 1:20:13.805
Since 1961, teflon
has liberated housewives...

1:20:13.892 --> 1:20:16.929
No, no, no.
Excuse me. Homemakers...

1:20:17.021 --> 1:20:19.307
This is a courtroom,
Mr. Wallace.

1:20:19.398 --> 1:20:21.138
Not the home shopping network.

1:20:23.319 --> 1:20:25.275
Plaintiffs have alleged
that dupont

1:20:25.362 --> 1:20:27.398
did not meet
its own standard of safety

1:20:27.489 --> 1:20:29.946
with regard to the level of c-8

1:20:30.034 --> 1:20:31.319
in the local water supply.

1:20:32.161 --> 1:20:33.571
That's irrelevant, your honor.

1:20:34.246 --> 1:20:35.656
We ask you to dismiss on grounds

1:20:35.748 --> 1:20:37.659
that the only standard
that matters,

1:20:37.750 --> 1:20:40.412
is the one that elected
government deems safe.

1:20:40.502 --> 1:20:41.662
Rob: Not if it's unregulated.

1:20:41.712 --> 1:20:43.794
It's government's job
to make these determinations.

1:20:43.881 --> 1:20:45.417
Not any one company.
It's a trap.

1:20:45.507 --> 1:20:46.872
They can't revert back to...

1:20:46.967 --> 1:20:48.082
I got it.

1:20:48.177 --> 1:20:49.963
Is there a problem,
Mr. deitzler?

1:20:50.054 --> 1:20:51.760
Apologies, your honor,

1:20:51.847 --> 1:20:55.510
but dupont has been hiding
the dangers of this chemical

1:20:55.601 --> 1:20:57.933
from the government
for a while now.

1:20:58.020 --> 1:21:00.477
And they're asking you
to let them off the hook

1:21:00.564 --> 1:21:02.850
because they've succeeded
in their strategy.

1:21:02.941 --> 1:21:05.023
Government doesn't regulate c-8.

1:21:05.110 --> 1:21:06.470
Wallace: Actually,
that's not true.

1:21:06.570 --> 1:21:07.570
No, no.

1:21:07.654 --> 1:21:09.690
The West Virginia's
c-8 working group

1:21:09.782 --> 1:21:11.272
has just issued a standard.

1:21:11.950 --> 1:21:13.110
Here with us today,

1:21:13.202 --> 1:21:15.122
is the governmental official
who led that effort,

1:21:15.496 --> 1:21:17.032
Dr. Mary sue kimball.

1:21:19.625 --> 1:21:22.116
And, Dr. kimball,
as a senior member

1:21:22.211 --> 1:21:24.452
of the state's department
of environmental protection,

1:21:24.546 --> 1:21:26.082
isn't it, in fact, your duty,

1:21:26.215 --> 1:21:28.415
to protect the citizens of West Virginia...
Mr. Wallace.

1:21:29.426 --> 1:21:30.541
I'll cut to the chase.

1:21:32.221 --> 1:21:33.961
What is the level of c-8
in drinking water

1:21:34.056 --> 1:21:36.217
that the state of West Virginia

1:21:38.602 --> 1:21:39.996
Harry: Watch it go from one
part per billion to?

1:21:40.020 --> 1:21:41.020
Five. Ten?

1:21:41.105 --> 1:21:42.766
150 parts per billion.

1:21:46.985 --> 1:21:49.977
Of all six water districts
represented in this suit,

1:21:50.364 --> 1:21:52.355
do they fall below
this maximum level?

1:21:52.449 --> 1:21:53.449
Well below.

1:21:54.660 --> 1:21:55.695
Nothing else, your honor.

1:21:57.079 --> 1:21:58.740
Your witness, Mr. deitzler.

1:21:58.831 --> 1:22:00.287
Wait. Who's on
the working group?

1:22:00.374 --> 1:22:01.705
Dupont, of course, and who else?

1:22:01.792 --> 1:22:03.186
Who did the water testing?
Mr. deitzler?

1:22:03.210 --> 1:22:04.871
When was it done?
One moment, judge.

1:22:04.962 --> 1:22:06.293
Rob: What was the sample size?

1:22:06.380 --> 1:22:07.460
We should be able to see...

1:22:07.506 --> 1:22:11.419
Going once, going twice...

1:22:11.510 --> 1:22:15.423
Dr. kimball, who were
the members of this cabal

1:22:15.514 --> 1:22:17.129
you call the c-8 working group?

1:22:17.224 --> 1:22:18.680
Objection.

1:22:19.017 --> 1:22:20.553
Cool it, Mr. deitzler.

1:22:22.104 --> 1:22:23.435
Go ahead, Dr. kimball.

1:22:23.897 --> 1:22:25.307
Agency officials,

1:22:25.399 --> 1:22:29.062
representatives of the scientific
community, um, stakeholders.

1:22:29.153 --> 1:22:30.893
Stakeholders?
Which stakeholders?

1:22:30.988 --> 1:22:34.446
Oh, wait, let me guess.
It rhymes with bouffant?

1:22:35.617 --> 1:22:37.357
Dupont is a stakeholder. Yes.

1:22:37.453 --> 1:22:38.613
So, I see.

1:22:38.704 --> 1:22:40.945
So, don't you find it peculiar
that on the Eve

1:22:41.457 --> 1:22:43.118
of a class action lawsuit,

1:22:43.208 --> 1:22:46.700
where dupont might be
considered liable

1:22:46.795 --> 1:22:49.286
for poisoning this community,

1:22:49.381 --> 1:22:52.214
they get you
to come in here suddenly

1:22:52.301 --> 1:22:56.089
and reverse decades of their
so-called heralded science?

1:22:57.222 --> 1:22:59.178
That's false.
I don't work for dupont.

1:22:59.266 --> 1:23:00.506
I didn't say you did.

1:23:01.351 --> 1:23:03.467
But now you bring it up,
we'll check back in a month.

1:23:03.562 --> 1:23:05.322
Your honor... you honestly,
was gonna plan on

1:23:05.355 --> 1:23:10.190
telling this community that they
can drink 150 times more c-8?

1:23:10.277 --> 1:23:11.983
I mean, come on,
people, bottoms up.

1:23:12.070 --> 1:23:13.070
Honestly, judge...

1:23:13.155 --> 1:23:15.316
All right, Mr. deitzler, enough.

1:23:16.575 --> 1:23:18.065
We'll be unveiling
the new standard

1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:19.616
at an upcoming public hearing.

1:23:20.287 --> 1:23:23.199
Unveiling. Oh,
that sounds like a party.

1:23:24.041 --> 1:23:25.041
We'll be there!

1:23:31.048 --> 1:23:33.790
Their safety standards thing,
that's all a sham.

1:23:33.884 --> 1:23:35.624
Thanks to the judge's decision,

1:23:35.719 --> 1:23:37.630
we will have our day in court.

1:23:37.721 --> 1:23:38.927
Man in crowd: Yes, we will!

1:23:39.014 --> 1:23:41.346
Because if the state
of West Virginia

1:23:41.433 --> 1:23:43.298
won't stop
the dupont corporation

1:23:43.393 --> 1:23:45.634
from literally
poisoning its citizens,

1:23:45.729 --> 1:23:49.062
then we, the citizens,
will stop them ourselves.

1:23:51.193 --> 1:23:53.479
Barbara Walters: Good evening
and welcome to 20/20.

1:23:53.570 --> 1:23:57.859
Well, it coats the pots you cook
with so the food doesn't stick.

1:23:57.950 --> 1:24:01.067
It protects the carpet
your baby crawls on.

1:24:01.161 --> 1:24:02.947
I miss carpet.

1:24:03.038 --> 1:24:05.245
Walters: Your skin lotion,
even your makeup.

1:24:05.332 --> 1:24:07.197
We're talking about teflon.

1:24:07.292 --> 1:24:10.284
And tonight our 20/20
investigation uncovers

1:24:10.379 --> 1:24:14.543
alarming information about
this much-used material.

1:24:14.633 --> 1:24:17.170
It is very alarming, Barbara.
I cook with teflon.

1:24:17.261 --> 1:24:20.378
I didn't know until I watched this
report that you're about to see,

1:24:20.472 --> 1:24:22.178
that if teflon
gets hot enough...

1:24:22.266 --> 1:24:24.052
Millions of people
have in their homes.

1:24:24.142 --> 1:24:25.495
Teflon has become
such a familiar...

1:24:25.519 --> 1:24:28.682
Substance that is also used in clothing
and cars. Even in contact lenses.

1:24:28.772 --> 1:24:32.105
Already found in the blood
of most Americans.

1:24:35.445 --> 1:24:38.466
Millions of homes across
Australia. Teflon, a non-stick surface...

1:24:38.490 --> 1:24:40.572
Male newscaster: The
environmental protection agency

1:24:40.659 --> 1:24:45.574
this morning announced it has opened a
priority review of the chemical c-8,

1:24:45.664 --> 1:24:48.280
currently the subject
of a class action lawsuit

1:24:48.375 --> 1:24:50.240
against the chemical giant
dupont.

1:24:50.335 --> 1:24:51.335
Darlene: Joe!

1:24:53.463 --> 1:24:56.455
Joe! Oh, my lord!
Joe, just wait!

1:24:56.550 --> 1:24:59.542
Wait for the fire department,
please, honey!

1:24:59.928 --> 1:25:01.919
Please don't go crazy!

1:25:02.014 --> 1:25:03.950
Newscaster 1: Have triggered a
mass panic amongst Chinese consumers.

1:25:03.974 --> 1:25:06.716
Newscaster 2: Just throw away
your non-stick pans, many experts...

1:25:06.810 --> 1:25:09.017
Newscaster 3: Are your pans
making you sick?

1:25:09.104 --> 1:25:10.810
That's the question
being asked...

1:25:10.897 --> 1:25:14.060
Newscaster 4: Kitchen
implements coated in teflon.

1:25:14.693 --> 1:25:17.685
Joe: The house was empty.
It belongs to my father.

1:25:18.071 --> 1:25:20.153
I don't know
how it could've started.

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:21.480
Fire captain: His name kiger?

1:25:23.118 --> 1:25:25.234
Think someone might have
got the wrong house?

1:25:33.837 --> 1:25:36.954
All-American mom: All of this
hullabaloo is just silly.

1:25:37.883 --> 1:25:41.091
Teflon is completely safe
for cooking.

1:25:41.178 --> 1:25:43.965
That is why we founded
the cook healthy campaign,

1:25:44.056 --> 1:25:45.592
to set the record straight.

1:25:45.724 --> 1:25:50.639
And besides being completely safe,
it is also...

1:25:57.903 --> 1:25:59.109
Copy that.

1:26:02.115 --> 1:26:03.480
All the way down.

1:27:08.223 --> 1:27:09.367
Videographer:
We're now on the record.

1:27:09.391 --> 1:27:13.259
This is the videotaped deposition
of Charles o. Holliday, Jr.,

1:27:13.353 --> 1:27:16.311
taken by the plaintiffs in
the matter of kiger et al

1:27:16.398 --> 1:27:19.606
v. The e.I. Dupont
de nemours and company.

1:27:19.693 --> 1:27:21.399
Court stenographer:
Raise your right hand.

1:27:22.112 --> 1:27:24.819
Do you swear to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

1:27:24.906 --> 1:27:26.021
I do.

1:27:27.451 --> 1:27:29.407
Rob: Uh, please state your name.

1:27:30.203 --> 1:27:31.943
Charles o. Holliday, Jr.

1:27:32.372 --> 1:27:35.739
And are you presently employed?

1:27:36.668 --> 1:27:37.828
Yes.

1:27:38.295 --> 1:27:40.331
What is your position?

1:27:41.298 --> 1:27:44.540
I'm the chairman and chief executive
officer of the dupont company.

1:27:45.886 --> 1:27:50.505
In dupont's most recent filing with the
securities and exchange commission,

1:27:50.599 --> 1:27:55.013
you state, "based on over 50
years of industry experience

1:27:55.103 --> 1:27:57.344
"and extensive scientific study,

1:27:57.439 --> 1:28:01.432
"dupont believes there is
no evidence that pfoa causes

1:28:01.526 --> 1:28:05.940
"any adverse human health effects
or harms the environment."

1:28:06.031 --> 1:28:08.147
You signed
that legal filing, correct?

1:28:08.241 --> 1:28:10.983
I don't recall the exact statement,
but that sounds right to me.

1:28:11.077 --> 1:28:15.116
Are you aware that dupont
has, in its own files,

1:28:15.207 --> 1:28:20.201
studies dating back to the 1970s
that say just the opposite?

1:28:20.504 --> 1:28:23.416
That pfoa, or c-8,
as it's called,

1:28:23.507 --> 1:28:26.590
has potentially life-threatening
effects on human health?

1:28:26.676 --> 1:28:29.588
I'm not familiar with the exact
studies we may have in our files.

1:28:29.679 --> 1:28:32.967
Then I'll take you through them.
Uh, exhibit 9.

1:28:38.313 --> 1:28:41.771
Uh, you were just
handed exhibit 9.

1:28:42.108 --> 1:28:46.192
Uh, do you see the date
march 13th, 19797? Yes.

1:28:46.321 --> 1:28:49.028
Do you see the dupont
logo at the top? Yes.

1:28:49.157 --> 1:28:52.866
Do you see this word
here, highlighted? Yes.

1:28:52.953 --> 1:28:55.615
Would you read it for me, please?
"Receptors."

1:28:56.456 --> 1:29:00.074
Do you know what that word
refers to, receptors?

1:29:00.627 --> 1:29:03.539
Um, in this context, I do not.

1:29:03.630 --> 1:29:05.245
It means human beings.

1:29:05.757 --> 1:29:07.839
Dupont refers
to the men and women

1:29:07.926 --> 1:29:11.669
that your company
exposed to c-8 as receptors.

1:29:11.763 --> 1:29:16.382
And in these receptors,
your scientists found,

1:29:16.476 --> 1:29:20.719
"significantly higher incidents
of allergic endocrine

1:29:20.814 --> 1:29:22.679
"and metabolic disorders."

1:29:22.774 --> 1:29:27.393
As well as, "excess risk of
developing liver disease."

1:29:27.487 --> 1:29:29.478
Do you see that? Yes.

1:29:31.157 --> 1:29:34.615
Moreover, you have
infertility at teflon.

1:29:34.703 --> 1:29:36.944
Occurrences of leukemia.

1:29:37.038 --> 1:29:39.324
You have excess of cancers.

1:29:39.416 --> 1:29:41.452
Bladder, kidney, oral, pharynx.

1:29:41.543 --> 1:29:44.034
Next paragraph. 78.

1:29:44.129 --> 1:29:46.666
Do you see that heading? Do you
see that date? Do you see that?

1:29:46.756 --> 1:29:49.247
Exhibit 96. Exhibit 53.

1:29:49.342 --> 1:29:51.424
I'd like to move on
to birth defects.

1:29:51.511 --> 1:29:52.711
We've gone almost seven hours.

1:29:52.762 --> 1:29:55.629
Mr. holliday, you're aware
that in 1981

1:29:55.724 --> 1:29:59.467
3m notified dupont that it had
conducted studies on rats.

1:29:59.561 --> 1:30:00.971
And these studies showed

1:30:01.062 --> 1:30:04.896
that sustained c-8 exposure
can cause facial deformities?

1:30:04.983 --> 1:30:06.723
I'm not aware of a study by 3m.

1:30:06.818 --> 1:30:11.403
How about dupont's own studies that
showed the same thing in humans?

1:30:14.492 --> 1:30:18.280
That's dupont's
pregnancy study from 1981.

1:30:18.580 --> 1:30:20.224
Does that look like
a dupont document to you?

1:30:20.248 --> 1:30:21.328
It looks to be.

1:30:23.376 --> 1:30:27.039
Are you aware that dupont has
denied that any such study

1:30:27.130 --> 1:30:29.587
ever even took place?

1:30:30.884 --> 1:30:33.546
I'm not familiar with specific
statements we've made about that.

1:30:33.637 --> 1:30:37.300
Seven pregnant women,
all dupont employees,

1:30:37.390 --> 1:30:39.426
all from the teflon line.

1:30:40.226 --> 1:30:42.308
Do you see this here?

1:30:42.395 --> 1:30:46.809
"Child, four months,
one nostril,

1:30:46.900 --> 1:30:49.107
"eye defect.” yes.

1:30:49.194 --> 1:30:52.402
Two of the seven women,
nearly 30%, gave birth

1:30:52.489 --> 1:30:56.357
to babies that had the exact facial
deformities that your company

1:30:56.451 --> 1:30:58.692
already knew about.
We're done here.

1:31:00.872 --> 1:31:01.987
Sir.

1:31:03.375 --> 1:31:05.206
His parents named him bucky.

1:31:08.922 --> 1:31:10.287
Bucky Bailey.

1:31:12.175 --> 1:31:14.541
This is your receptor.

1:31:23.019 --> 1:31:24.384
Now we're done.

1:33:01.409 --> 1:33:05.118
Newscaster: The environmental protection
agency has levied the largest fine

1:33:05.205 --> 1:33:09.039
in agency history against
the chemical giant, dupont.

1:33:09.501 --> 1:33:14.120
The epa concluded the company failed
to report the health dangers of c-8

1:33:14.214 --> 1:33:16.796
used in the manufacture
of teflon.

1:33:17.300 --> 1:33:21.043
Dupont will pay the epa
16.5 million.

1:33:22.347 --> 1:33:26.340
It earns a billion dollars in
profits from teflon each year.

1:33:33.483 --> 1:33:34.814
Mediator: To recap,

1:33:34.901 --> 1:33:38.109
we've agreed that dupont will
clean local water supplies.

1:33:38.196 --> 1:33:41.780
Install infiltration systems
in all six water districts.

1:33:42.700 --> 1:33:46.409
Additionally, dupont will pay 70
million in cash to the class.

1:33:46.496 --> 1:33:48.703
Three days' revenue
on the teflon line.

1:33:49.874 --> 1:33:53.742
Mediator: Which leaves our most
challenging issue. Medical monitoring.

1:33:53.837 --> 1:33:56.920
We've agreed to establish
an independent science panel

1:33:57.006 --> 1:34:01.545
comprised of three scientists who
have no relationship to either side.

1:34:02.387 --> 1:34:05.845
This independent panel will
study the members of this class

1:34:05.932 --> 1:34:09.766
to determine whether c-8 exposure
has led to increased incidents

1:34:09.853 --> 1:34:11.844
of disease in this region.

1:34:12.647 --> 1:34:15.480
If the panel finds that there
are probable scientific links

1:34:15.567 --> 1:34:18.980
to a particular disease, the
health of everyone in the class

1:34:19.070 --> 1:34:22.983
will be monitored for
that disease in perpetuity

1:34:23.074 --> 1:34:26.487
at dupont's cost,
up to 235 million.

1:34:26.578 --> 1:34:29.365
And any class member
who develops that disease

1:34:29.455 --> 1:34:32.117
can sue dupont for damages.

1:34:32.959 --> 1:34:34.119
However...

1:34:34.711 --> 1:34:38.624
If the science panel fails to
establish probable scientific links,

1:34:39.340 --> 1:34:40.500
then this case is over.

1:34:40.592 --> 1:34:44.130
No monitoring.
No lawsuits. No exceptions.

1:34:44.929 --> 1:34:48.592
Good. Well, gentlemen, you are now
officially in the hands of science.

1:34:49.934 --> 1:34:54.394
Harry: Well, wouldn't have
pegged you as a Mai Tai guy.

1:34:55.273 --> 1:34:57.730
It's festive. Wouldn't have
pegged you for that either.

1:34:57.817 --> 1:35:00.559
We have something to celebrate.
Yeah?

1:35:00.653 --> 1:35:01.733
Larry: Do we?

1:35:03.072 --> 1:35:06.860
Look, how do we know
that the panel's gonna prove

1:35:06.951 --> 1:35:09.567
that dupont made
all these people sick?

1:35:10.330 --> 1:35:12.821
I'm no scientist,
but even I know you'd need

1:35:15.835 --> 1:35:17.496
thousands of blood samples
and...

1:35:17.587 --> 1:35:19.828
Harry: From people
who don't trust us.

1:35:19.923 --> 1:35:23.211
"Hey, folks, we wanna stick you with
some needles. You won't mind, will ya?"

1:35:24.385 --> 1:35:26.797
I know these people, you know.

1:35:27.513 --> 1:35:30.050
They're gonna
take the money and run.

1:35:30.141 --> 1:35:31.256
Wouldn't you?

1:35:31.351 --> 1:35:36.015
I think they want more than just the money.
I think they...

1:35:36.981 --> 1:35:39.518
They wanna know if they're
gonna get sick or not.

1:35:39.609 --> 1:35:42.601
Or if they have c-8 in their
blood, and what that's gonna do

1:35:42.695 --> 1:35:45.107
to them and their families.

1:35:46.366 --> 1:35:48.857
So, we're just gonna trust
that they show up?

1:35:48.952 --> 1:35:52.410
Trust, but verify.
What does that mean, Rob?

1:35:53.706 --> 1:35:56.743
Well, come in for an exam.

1:35:56.834 --> 1:36:00.201
Um, give us a blood sample.

1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:02.962
Then, we'll give you your check.

1:36:05.843 --> 1:36:07.925
On second thought,
make mine a Mai Tai.

1:36:08.012 --> 1:36:09.012
All around, please.

1:36:10.431 --> 1:36:12.547
Rob bilott. Yeah.

1:36:12.684 --> 1:36:14.845
Where'd you pull that out of?

1:36:15.061 --> 1:36:17.552
Woman: Healthy drinking
water is vital to all of us.

1:36:17.647 --> 1:36:20.730
That's why scientists need
to know if the chemical c-8

1:36:20.817 --> 1:36:22.307
causes any health problems.

1:36:22.402 --> 1:36:26.190
Starting today, you can help by completing
a health questionnaire and having...

1:36:29.242 --> 1:36:31.028
Oh, come on!

1:36:31.119 --> 1:36:32.972
Radio dj: Medical Van's downtown.
Well, how about you?

1:36:32.996 --> 1:36:36.989
You gonna get your blood tested?
Guest: Nah. I hate needles.

1:36:37.083 --> 1:36:39.119
Radio dj: It's $400, buddy.

1:36:39.919 --> 1:36:40.919
Guest: Really?

1:36:41.004 --> 1:36:43.120
Radio dj:
Got your attention, didn't I?

1:37:11.743 --> 1:37:15.201
Woman: Okay. Okay.
All right. All right.

1:37:15.788 --> 1:37:17.494
Yeah. That'll work.

1:37:17.582 --> 1:37:19.243
We bring them back here.

1:37:20.376 --> 1:37:22.867
Draw the blood,
hand them a check.

1:37:22.962 --> 1:37:25.203
Rob: $4007? Each.

1:37:25.298 --> 1:37:27.129
Lots of money around here.

1:37:27.300 --> 1:37:29.111
How many you brought
with you today, miss luannn?

1:37:29.135 --> 1:37:31.501
My husband,
and my three kids, and me.

1:37:31.596 --> 1:37:33.052
Dr. Brooks: $2,000.

1:37:33.139 --> 1:37:35.972
Not too shabby right before Christmas.
Yup.

1:37:36.976 --> 1:37:39.058
But you ain't
gonna find nothing.

1:37:39.145 --> 1:37:42.228
Dupont's good people.
You'll see.

1:37:45.985 --> 1:37:47.504
Gigi, gigi, gigi!

1:37:47.528 --> 1:37:50.520
It's your turn to put
the angel on the top.

1:37:51.032 --> 1:37:53.398
You do it, sweetie.
Gigi's too pooped.

1:37:53.493 --> 1:37:56.451
Why don't you get your uncle
Ben to give you a boost?

1:37:56.537 --> 1:37:59.495
Ooh. Mom, you okay?

1:37:59.582 --> 1:38:00.582
Yeah.

1:38:00.666 --> 1:38:02.156
Seriously, it's huge.

1:38:02.251 --> 1:38:04.229
They're gonna be making you
partner this year. I know it.

1:38:04.253 --> 1:38:06.118
Well, they'd better. I mean...

1:38:06.381 --> 1:38:07.996
Mommy, come see!

1:38:08.091 --> 1:38:09.234
Hey, baby,
did you hang that ornament?

1:38:09.258 --> 1:38:11.249
Sarah: Rob, can you get that?
Karla: Let me see.

1:38:11.344 --> 1:38:12.550
Rob: Okay, I'm coming.

1:38:16.557 --> 1:38:17.557
Hello?

1:38:17.642 --> 1:38:20.008
Larry: Rob, you sitting down for this?
Larry, what's wrong?

1:38:20.103 --> 1:38:23.516
Sixty-nine thousand.
Sixty-nine thousand what?

1:38:23.606 --> 1:38:26.723
Sixty-nine thousand people got tested.
Sixty-nine thousand!

1:38:26.818 --> 1:38:28.934
Do you realize
how much data this is?

1:38:29.028 --> 1:38:30.422
It's what we needed, Rob!
This is it!

1:38:30.446 --> 1:38:32.937
Oh, my god. You were right
all along, my friend.

1:38:33.032 --> 1:38:34.442
Merry Christmas! Thank you!

1:38:34.534 --> 1:38:36.024
You bet. Thank you!

1:38:36.119 --> 1:38:37.404
Talk real soon.

1:38:39.122 --> 1:38:41.078
Hey, who was that?
You won't believe it.

1:38:41.165 --> 1:38:43.781
Daddy, guess what I just did?
What? What'd you just do?

1:38:43.876 --> 1:38:45.707
I put the angel on the top.

1:38:45.795 --> 1:38:47.160
Yeah? Uncle Ben lifted me.

1:38:47.255 --> 1:38:49.871
He did? Like this? Oh!

1:38:49.966 --> 1:38:53.754
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Guests: Merry Christmas!

1:39:08.568 --> 1:39:13.107
Minister: We are gathered here today
in the memory of wilbur Earl tennant.

1:39:13.614 --> 1:39:16.481
"The lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want.

1:39:17.076 --> 1:39:19.738
"He makes me lie down
in green pastures.

1:39:20.246 --> 1:39:25.081
"He leads me besides still waters.
He restoreth my soul.

1:39:25.168 --> 1:39:28.660
"Even though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

1:39:28.754 --> 1:39:30.915
"I will fear no evil..."

1:40:03.498 --> 1:40:05.184
Teddy: Quick, everybody.
Mustard or ketchup?

1:40:05.208 --> 1:40:07.369
Charlie: Teddy, for the tenth
time, that's my ketchup.

1:40:07.460 --> 1:40:10.452
Sarah: Charlie, don't start. Charlie: What?
It's mine. I got it.

1:40:10.546 --> 1:40:13.208
He's got his own, okay? Young
farmer: You're that lawyer.

1:40:13.591 --> 1:40:14.751
Finish up.

1:40:16.385 --> 1:40:20.128
My brother's Dale lamb. You took his blood.
Said you'd help him.

1:40:20.890 --> 1:40:23.427
Yeah, I did. We're... we're
working on it. I promise.

1:40:23.518 --> 1:40:24.849
He's dead.

1:40:26.604 --> 1:40:28.390
Testicular cancer.

1:40:30.441 --> 1:40:33.057
Left three little boys
younger than yours.

1:40:38.282 --> 1:40:40.489
But you enjoy your family.

1:40:43.079 --> 1:40:44.079
Okay. Everybody up.

1:40:44.163 --> 1:40:45.824
I'm not finished. I said up.

1:41:24.704 --> 1:41:28.242
Well, Darlene can't even leave the
house without being harassed!

1:41:29.542 --> 1:41:33.205
First, they blame us
for suing dupont,

1:41:33.296 --> 1:41:36.754
and now they hate on us 'cause
they ain't seen nothing from it!

1:41:36.841 --> 1:41:39.833
Rob: I'm sorry, Joe... well,
that ain't good enough!

1:41:40.094 --> 1:41:43.632
And they wonder why in the
hell it takes four damn years

1:41:43.723 --> 1:41:47.181
to read a lousy blood sample,
and I don't blame 'em!

1:41:47.602 --> 1:41:51.720
We trusted you, Rob.
We put our faith in you.

1:41:51.814 --> 1:41:54.180
- I know, Joe. I'm so...
- All right?

1:41:58.654 --> 1:42:02.738
Rob: Isn't there just some
kind of a progress report?

1:42:02.825 --> 1:42:06.067
Anything that I can
share with these folks?

1:42:06.162 --> 1:42:08.653
I mean, they...
They have been waiting.

1:42:08.748 --> 1:42:10.225
Panel assistant:
I'm sorry, Mr. bilott.

1:42:10.249 --> 1:42:11.989
The panel is still
in the process of

1:42:12.084 --> 1:42:13.995
analyzing complex data
and modeling

1:42:14.086 --> 1:42:16.828
from thousands of samples
and medical histories.

1:42:16.964 --> 1:42:20.081
I'm so sorry. Could you hold a moment?

1:42:30.269 --> 1:42:32.430
Sarah: Charlie,
don't pick at your food.

1:42:34.148 --> 1:42:35.388
Tony: What's a hooker?

1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:39.100
Where did you learn that?

1:42:39.195 --> 1:42:41.937
He told me that
Mary magdalene was a hooker.

1:42:43.699 --> 1:42:46.862
What? She was. You're
supposed to say prostitute.

1:42:46.952 --> 1:42:49.364
Sarah: And then she found god

1:42:49.455 --> 1:42:52.242
and became one of Jesus's
most fervent disciples.

1:42:53.959 --> 1:42:55.479
See? I was just
teaching him the Bible.

1:42:55.961 --> 1:42:58.418
I can't today. So everybody up.

1:42:59.048 --> 1:43:00.538
Everybody up!

1:43:08.391 --> 1:43:11.599
Can we still afford it? What?

1:43:12.561 --> 1:43:13.846
Catholic school.

1:43:29.662 --> 1:43:31.698
My brother's back in rehab.
Did you know that?

1:43:34.667 --> 1:43:37.659
No, I'm sorry. Today's...

1:43:39.338 --> 1:43:41.795
Today's mom's first day
at chemo.

1:43:42.425 --> 1:43:43.425
I forgot.

1:43:43.509 --> 1:43:46.251
'Cause it's not
about your case, Rob.

1:43:46.512 --> 1:43:47.718
Carl

1:43:47.805 --> 1:43:49.090
Tony: Gosh. Okay. Jimmies.

1:43:55.104 --> 1:43:58.847
Teddy forged my signature, and
Tony's quitting football. Tony.

1:43:58.941 --> 1:44:00.932
But how would you
know about that, right?

1:44:01.026 --> 1:44:03.108
Because all you see,
all that you...

1:44:03.195 --> 1:44:06.687
You... the boys have ever seen
is you, obsessing about this...

1:44:11.203 --> 1:44:12.909
Have I ever complained?

1:44:16.667 --> 1:44:19.534
Say something,
for god's sakes, Rob!

1:44:19.628 --> 1:44:21.584
No. No?

1:44:21.672 --> 1:44:23.458
No. No.

1:44:24.508 --> 1:44:26.544
Because I knew that
you needed something.

1:44:26.635 --> 1:44:29.377
Some connection... something.

1:44:29.472 --> 1:44:30.472
And...

1:44:30.890 --> 1:44:31.890
So I took it on.

1:44:33.058 --> 1:44:37.017
But if you want to start accounting,
if you want to start with,

1:44:37.104 --> 1:44:39.140
"oh, can we afford," then...

1:44:42.485 --> 1:44:44.191
I don't know, Rob.

1:44:45.154 --> 1:44:47.896
Can the boys afford a father who
can't string two words together?

1:44:47.990 --> 1:44:50.527
Can our marriage
afford 13 years of...

1:44:50.618 --> 1:44:52.483
Thirteen years of this?

1:44:55.164 --> 1:44:58.748
How about it, Rob? You wanna talk about it?
About our lives?

1:45:02.922 --> 1:45:04.253
Of course not.

1:45:06.008 --> 1:45:08.215
I'll tell mom
you asked about her.

1:45:11.180 --> 1:45:14.547
Tom: What in god's name is that panel
doing? Why are we still getting bills?

1:45:14.934 --> 1:45:17.175
Overhead. Uh...

1:45:17.269 --> 1:45:18.349
Local counsel.

1:45:18.437 --> 1:45:21.019
Harry's call center...
$1,000 an hour.

1:45:21.106 --> 1:45:23.438
That... that was
a technical expert.

1:45:23.526 --> 1:45:27.735
We needed to do filings when dupont
started lobbying Washington...

1:45:27.822 --> 1:45:29.528
That's Washington's problem,
not ours.

1:45:29.615 --> 1:45:31.335
That's why you got them involved.
Your memo.

1:45:31.367 --> 1:45:34.109
It was just a fine, Tom.
It's a fine. Sixteen million.

1:45:34.203 --> 1:45:37.036
It's... it's nothing for these people.
It's pocket change.

1:45:37.122 --> 1:45:39.601
Yes, but if they get charged with
criminal concealment, game over.

1:45:39.625 --> 1:45:42.241
You said DOJ was investigating.
Not anymore.

1:45:42.378 --> 1:45:44.209
What? They dropped
the investigation.

1:45:44.338 --> 1:45:46.829
They dropped... what? They dropped it.
No reason given.

1:45:49.677 --> 1:45:53.511
Tom, our government is
captive to dupont.

1:45:53.973 --> 1:45:56.806
This case,
it's the only hope we have.

1:45:56.892 --> 1:45:59.304
They know that, and they're
trying to make it as expensive

1:45:59.395 --> 1:46:02.182
as they can to force you
to make me stop.

1:46:04.358 --> 1:46:06.223
Just tell me how much longer.
I...

1:46:07.319 --> 1:46:10.777
I... I can't. I. 1 wish I could.

1:46:12.366 --> 1:46:13.651
Tom, I... are you okay?

1:46:13.742 --> 1:46:15.278
Um, I'm fine. I'm just...

1:46:15.369 --> 1:46:19.738
Rob, I'm a managing partner
now. I have a firm to run.

1:46:20.249 --> 1:46:24.083
I know. And Tom, I think there
could be a huge payout here...

1:46:24.169 --> 1:46:25.534
You think I'm in this for money?

1:46:26.338 --> 1:46:27.453
No, I... you think I am...

1:46:27.548 --> 1:46:32.008
Letting you drag this firm's
reputation through a meat grinder

1:46:32.094 --> 1:46:33.709
for some kind of
plaintiff's payoff?

1:46:36.181 --> 1:46:38.888
I... I don't know why you're doing it.

1:46:43.147 --> 1:46:45.433
Rob, listen, I... I'm sorry,

1:46:45.524 --> 1:46:48.106
but you're gonna have to
take another pay cut.

1:46:48.193 --> 1:46:51.105
Tom, that's...
That's my fourth pay cut.

1:46:51.196 --> 1:46:54.154
Rob: I... I'm down
to a third now.

1:46:54.241 --> 1:46:56.641
Tom: You don't have any clients.
No one will take your calls.

1:46:58.203 --> 1:47:02.446
What am I supposed to do here?
Now, I'm on your side, but...

1:47:02.791 --> 1:47:03.791
Rob?

1:47:04.710 --> 1:47:07.122
Amy? Amy!

1:47:07.212 --> 1:47:09.203
Tom's secretary: Kathleen!
Tom: Get some help!

1:47:09.298 --> 1:47:10.898
Tom's secretary: Kathleen!
Get some help!

1:47:11.133 --> 1:47:13.124
Kathleen: Rob! Rob!

1:47:23.354 --> 1:47:25.561
Tom: Looks like
we should, uh, cancel

1:47:25.648 --> 1:47:28.765
my 4:00 with Jerry and...

1:47:28.859 --> 1:47:31.441
I don't know.
We're waiting to find out.

1:47:31.528 --> 1:47:32.608
It was, uh...

1:47:35.783 --> 1:47:38.445
Make... make sure that,
uh, Jerry knows that...

1:47:39.787 --> 1:47:41.323
I... I have to go.

1:47:42.206 --> 1:47:43.696
Mrs. bilott? Yes.

1:47:43.791 --> 1:47:46.999
We think your husband's
most likely experienced a Tia.

1:47:47.086 --> 1:47:49.293
A transient ischemic attack.

1:47:49.380 --> 1:47:53.794
Blood is briefly cut off to the brain,
mimicking the symptoms of a stroke.

1:47:55.302 --> 1:47:59.295
Uh, excuse me. A Tia?
This wasn't short.

1:47:59.515 --> 1:48:01.881
It... it kept going on.

1:48:01.976 --> 1:48:03.307
What about poison?

1:48:03.936 --> 1:48:05.267
I'm sorry?

1:48:05.771 --> 1:48:08.012
Could someone be poisoning him?

1:48:08.107 --> 1:48:11.440
No, Mrs. bilott.
This is neurological.

1:48:12.111 --> 1:48:13.726
You just said
it wasn't a stroke.

1:48:13.821 --> 1:48:15.607
Well, not this time.

1:48:15.698 --> 1:48:17.258
What does that mean?
Well, it means that

1:48:17.366 --> 1:48:19.357
he needs to never miss his medication.
Mmm-hmm.

1:48:19.451 --> 1:48:22.614
And needs to reduce all sources
of stress in his life.

1:48:22.955 --> 1:48:25.287
He's under
enormous pressure at work.

1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:29.208
Well, that needs to change.
But he's a young man.

1:48:29.294 --> 1:48:30.854
He shouldn't be
having these incidences.

1:48:32.381 --> 1:48:34.337
He's sedated, but
you can see him.

1:48:34.466 --> 1:48:37.708
I'll check in on him tomorrow.
Thank you. Thank you.

1:48:45.310 --> 1:48:47.892
I'll give you some privacy.

1:48:49.773 --> 1:48:52.640
Anything you need, call me.

1:48:56.030 --> 1:48:58.737
I need you to stop making
him feel like a failure.

1:49:05.205 --> 1:49:09.073
I appreciate the stress that your
family must be going through.

1:49:09.168 --> 1:49:12.626
Please don't talk to
me like I'm the wife.

1:49:16.383 --> 1:49:19.591
Did Rob ever tell you about
moving around as a kid?

1:49:22.014 --> 1:49:24.721
Ten times before senior year.

1:49:24.808 --> 1:49:26.844
No friends, no ties, no...

1:49:26.935 --> 1:49:29.472
Just him, his sister, his folks.

1:49:31.565 --> 1:49:33.806
Then I came along and
you came along and...

1:49:36.278 --> 1:49:38.485
Taft, it's not just a job.

1:49:38.572 --> 1:49:41.484
To himit's... it's home.

1:49:45.245 --> 1:49:47.782
And he was willing
to risk all that

1:49:48.082 --> 1:49:50.619
for a stranger who
needed his help.

1:49:52.127 --> 1:49:57.121
Now, you and I may not
know what that is,

1:49:59.343 --> 1:50:01.254
but it's not failure.

1:50:35.587 --> 1:50:39.830
Lord, you have searched my heart

1:50:40.259 --> 1:50:45.253
parishioners: And you
know when I sit and when I stand

1:50:45.764 --> 1:50:48.972
your hand is upon me

1:50:49.059 --> 1:50:52.517
protecting me from death

1:50:52.688 --> 1:50:57.808
keeping me from harm

1:50:59.736 --> 1:51:05.902
oh, lord, I know you are near

1:51:10.330 --> 1:51:15.245
standing always at

1:51:15.335 --> 1:51:18.498
my side

1:51:45.741 --> 1:51:48.027
Bailey: Hey, do you
know the score?

1:51:49.328 --> 1:51:53.037
The game? Sorry,
my radio's busted.

1:51:54.666 --> 1:51:55.951
Sorry.

1:51:56.251 --> 1:51:58.207
Don't worry about it.
It'll be a surprise.

1:51:58.503 --> 1:52:00.164
Bucky, come on. We'll be late.

1:52:02.007 --> 1:52:03.042
Have a good one.

1:53:45.527 --> 1:53:48.167
Leary: Hey,
Rob, bill leary. We haven't met.

1:53:48.363 --> 1:53:50.103
I'm the new comptroller
out of Indianapolis.

1:53:50.449 --> 1:53:53.737
Listen, we need to talk about these
unbilled hours and these unreimbursed...

1:54:10.427 --> 1:54:12.884
Hello? Dr. frank: Mr. bilott?

1:54:13.513 --> 1:54:14.673
Yes?

1:54:14.765 --> 1:54:17.928
I guess I should start
by apologizing for taking...

1:54:18.352 --> 1:54:20.593
Well, seven years to call you.

1:54:20.687 --> 1:54:22.678
Who is this? Oh, yes, of course.

1:54:22.814 --> 1:54:26.557
It's Dr. Karen frank from the...
Science panel?

1:54:27.944 --> 1:54:31.732
Again, I'm so sorry to have kept
you waiting this long, Mr. bilott.

1:54:32.115 --> 1:54:34.857
But there was just so much data...
Please, doctor, please,

1:54:35.202 --> 1:54:36.202
can you...

1:54:36.286 --> 1:54:38.493
Would just please
tell me what's happened?

1:54:38.580 --> 1:54:41.287
What's happening?
What you've found out?

1:54:41.375 --> 1:54:44.708
Yes. You gave us an
unprecedented amount of data.

1:54:45.295 --> 1:54:48.287
The largest epidemiological
study in human history.

1:54:49.049 --> 1:54:53.133
It's irrefutable. We have linked
sustained exposure to c-8

1:54:53.220 --> 1:54:56.758
to six categories of
serious illness.

1:55:01.645 --> 1:55:04.808
Kidney cancer,
testicular cancer...

1:55:05.399 --> 1:55:08.141
Thyroid disease, preeclampsia...

1:55:08.235 --> 1:55:10.977
High cholesterol,
ulcerative colitis.

1:55:12.322 --> 1:55:16.110
3,535 people in the class
already have these diseases.

1:55:17.035 --> 1:55:18.821
Many more will develop them.

1:55:20.831 --> 1:55:24.164
Thanks to you the entire
class will be monitored...

1:55:24.251 --> 1:55:27.539
And those who get sick
cah seek restitution.

1:55:29.297 --> 1:55:32.789
You did a good thing here,
Mr. bilott. You did good.

1:55:35.512 --> 1:55:37.093
Thank you.

1:57:30.126 --> 1:57:33.539
Rob? What happened?

1:57:38.009 --> 1:57:39.465
Rob?

1:57:41.721 --> 1:57:43.461
Dupont, they're reneging.

1:57:45.809 --> 1:57:48.095
Which part? All of it.

1:57:49.104 --> 1:57:50.640
They're tearing up
our agreement.

1:57:51.022 --> 1:57:52.558
Rejecting the science panel.

1:57:52.649 --> 1:57:55.982
They're gonna fight
every claim in court.

1:57:56.069 --> 1:57:59.561
Thousands of claims. People,
sick people, they'll give up.

1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:01.571
They can't fight dupont!

1:58:02.033 --> 1:58:04.775
How can they go back on...

1:58:04.911 --> 1:58:06.993
Sarah. They can't go
back on everything.

1:58:07.080 --> 1:58:08.365
They're a titan of industry.

1:58:08.456 --> 1:58:09.767
They can do whatever
the hell they want.

1:58:09.791 --> 1:58:10.951
Nothing else matters.

1:58:11.042 --> 1:58:12.578
They can fight
you all they want.

1:58:12.669 --> 1:58:14.349
It doesn't take away
from what you've done!

1:58:14.421 --> 1:58:17.663
Of course, it does. That's
exactly what it does!

1:58:19.217 --> 1:58:21.337
They want to show the world
that it's no use fighting.

1:58:21.428 --> 1:58:24.215
Look, everybody, even
he can't crack the maze

1:58:24.306 --> 1:58:25.466
and he's helped build it!

1:58:26.474 --> 1:58:28.339
The system is rigged!

1:58:29.644 --> 1:58:31.509
They want us to think
it'll protect us,

1:58:31.605 --> 1:58:32.685
but that's a lie.

1:58:32.772 --> 1:58:34.683
We protect us. We do.

1:58:34.941 --> 1:58:36.056
Nobody else.

1:58:37.986 --> 1:58:40.693
Not the companies.
Not the scientists.

1:58:40.780 --> 1:58:42.520
Not the government. Us.

1:58:45.994 --> 1:58:49.157
A farmer with a 12th grade
education told me that.

1:58:51.458 --> 1:58:55.827
On day one, he knew
and I thought he was crazy.

1:59:03.178 --> 1:59:04.793
Isn't that crazy?

1:59:09.100 --> 1:59:11.091
No.

2:00:16.668 --> 2:00:18.283
Court officer: All rise.

2:00:18.503 --> 2:00:19.913
The honorable Timothy burg...

2:00:20.004 --> 2:00:23.462
United States district judge for the
Southern district of Ohio presiding.

2:00:23.550 --> 2:00:26.132
This court is now in session
pursuant to the adjournment.

2:00:26.219 --> 2:00:27.925
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

2:00:28.012 --> 2:00:30.378
All persons having business
with this honorable court

2:00:30.640 --> 2:00:33.507
draw near, give their attention
and they shall be heard.

2:00:33.601 --> 2:00:36.343
God save the United States
and this honorable court.

2:00:36.438 --> 2:00:38.019
Please be seated.

2:00:38.106 --> 2:00:40.518
And we're here this
morning for a jury trial.

2:00:41.151 --> 2:00:45.611
So, 3,535 claims.

2:00:46.156 --> 2:00:48.397
At a rate of four
or five cases a year,

2:00:48.491 --> 2:00:50.482
we can all expect
to be here till...

2:00:51.578 --> 2:00:54.695
Well, the year 2890.
If we're lucky.

2:00:55.582 --> 2:00:56.867
Guess we'd better get started.

2:00:57.542 --> 2:00:59.453
Mrs. Johnson, is your
attorney present?

2:01:00.754 --> 2:01:01.754
Good morning, your honor.

2:01:01.838 --> 2:01:03.044
Rob bilott for the plaintiff.

2:01:03.798 --> 2:01:05.880
Oh, still here, huh?

2:01:06.843 --> 2:01:07.843
Still here.
