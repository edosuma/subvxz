00:00.125 --> 00:02.936
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:02.961 --> 00:04.994
I remember. Everything.

00:05.297 --> 00:06.663
I love you.

00:07.692 --> 00:08.725
Henry?

00:08.760 --> 00:10.159
You broke the curse.

00:10.195 --> 00:12.762
When I pass the dagger
on to this Guardian,

00:12.797 --> 00:14.497
the Darkness will finally rest.

00:14.532 --> 00:16.165
And I will be reunited with Belle.

00:16.201 --> 00:17.734
Trying to get back to your beloved

00:17.769 --> 00:20.503
has made you the worst version of you.

00:23.975 --> 00:25.341
Hello, Dearie!

00:25.377 --> 00:27.844
Did you really think a
wish realm could hold me?

00:27.879 --> 00:29.712
I need to figure out what my story is.

00:29.748 --> 00:32.115
It's time I figure out where I belong.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

01:23.097 --> 01:24.934
I knew I'd find you.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.620
Don't worry. I got this.

02:06.602 --> 02:08.535
You saved me.

02:08.570 --> 02:10.237
My hero.

02:12.975 --> 02:15.275
Henry?

02:15.311 --> 02:16.977
What are you doing here?

02:17.012 --> 02:19.212
I, uh...

02:19.248 --> 02:21.048
was in the neighborhood.

02:21.083 --> 02:23.817
Thought you could use another
familiar face when you woke up.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.218
Well, thank you.

02:25.254 --> 02:27.587
I don't know what I would
have done without your support.

02:32.161 --> 02:33.260
Isn't he sweet?

02:33.295 --> 02:35.262
Like the brother I never had.

02:46.375 --> 02:49.609
Some scars go more than skin deep.

02:49.645 --> 02:53.613
And I have a feeling that
one goes right to the bone.

02:53.649 --> 02:57.117
Rumplestiltskin. What
are you doing here?

02:57.851 --> 02:59.720
I come all the way from the Wish Realm

02:59.755 --> 03:01.988
just to see you, and that's my welcome?

03:03.035 --> 03:05.769
I don't care what version
of the Dark One you are.

03:06.462 --> 03:07.961
I'm not in the mood for your games.

03:07.996 --> 03:10.731
Games? I don't have
time for games, Dearie.

03:10.766 --> 03:12.466
I'm here to offer you a deal.

03:12.501 --> 03:13.600
No.

03:13.635 --> 03:16.002
All your deals come with a price.

03:16.038 --> 03:18.205
And I'm not interested in paying it.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.107
And why not?

03:20.142 --> 03:23.276
I can get you a happy
beginning, middle, and an end.

03:23.312 --> 03:26.446
Beautiful princess. Sparkling castle.

03:26.482 --> 03:29.015
Anything you dream can be yours.

03:29.051 --> 03:31.385
Thanks, but I'll be all right.

03:32.451 --> 03:33.854
Perhaps.

03:34.787 --> 03:36.323
Don't threaten me.

03:36.358 --> 03:38.658
Not a threat, Dearie.

03:39.373 --> 03:41.461
An observation.

03:42.272 --> 03:44.364
But good luck.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.768
If things don't improve,
consider this a standing offer.

03:48.350 --> 03:50.070
I'll be here for you.

03:51.284 --> 03:52.906
Always.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.107
No need.

03:54.143 --> 03:55.842
I know your tricks.

03:55.878 --> 03:57.345
You make people feel desperate

03:57.370 --> 04:00.013
so they start losing hope...

04:00.167 --> 04:02.384
- Hm.
- and think that doing the wrong thing

04:02.409 --> 04:04.375
is their only option.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.845
I'll find my happy ending the right way.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.113
I don't need your help.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.387
We'll see about that.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.507
Okay.

04:35.542 --> 04:39.010
One hot cocoa with
cinnamon for my daughter

04:39.757 --> 04:42.680
and one drink special for my wife.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.049
My mom calls it "The Weed Killer."

04:45.085 --> 04:46.518
I love it.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.286
Especially the plant sprig.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.054
How about a toast?

04:50.090 --> 04:51.956
Oh, good idea.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.424
To being together.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.361
We can drink to that, too.

04:56.396 --> 04:58.162
And eat to it.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.898
We brought some of Sabine's beignets.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.032
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.767
Hey, Alice.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.002
How's your father?

05:04.037 --> 05:05.436
He should be discharged
from the hospital

05:05.472 --> 05:06.638
and back home today.

05:06.673 --> 05:09.240
So things are starting
to look right side up.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.942
Oh, I'm glad.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.510
Yeah. Us too.

05:13.804 --> 05:15.188
- How about we all get some food? Yeah?
- Yep.

05:15.213 --> 05:16.180
- Yeah.
- Yes.

05:16.205 --> 05:18.283
Hey, Remy, will you
take those to the bar?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.918
Do I smell beignets?

05:19.953 --> 05:21.486
- Mm-hmm.
- Sure!

05:21.521 --> 05:23.588
Hey, uh...

05:23.623 --> 05:27.158
not to ruin the fun, but
I just wanted to check in.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.227
See if you've heard from Facilier.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.596
Uh, no, I haven't.

05:32.167 --> 05:33.331
You think we should be worried

05:33.366 --> 05:35.500
that he might be up to something?

05:35.535 --> 05:37.576
I don't know.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.345
Starfish?

05:51.370 --> 05:53.585
Yes, Papa, it's me.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.321
It's, uh...

05:56.356 --> 05:57.488
it's nice to hear your voice.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.592
Try looking across the street.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.935
Now, I know I can't come any closer.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.804
Not without putting you
back in that awful hospital.

06:12.839 --> 06:14.806
But I did want to see you.

06:14.841 --> 06:17.542
Yeah, I know. It's okay.

06:17.577 --> 06:19.444
How are you? How's Robin?

06:19.479 --> 06:21.212
Yeah, good. Great.

06:21.281 --> 06:23.781
We, uh... we've just
come back from a party.

06:23.817 --> 06:24.849
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.084
Everyone sends their best.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.848
We were celebrating the
end of the curse and...

06:30.523 --> 06:32.290
everyone being together.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.761
Yeah, sounds fun.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.830
Yeah, it was.

06:39.560 --> 06:45.103
But then I started thinking
about how no curse...

06:45.513 --> 06:47.372
you and me...

06:47.407 --> 06:49.440
well, we can't be together.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.009
I know it's hard right now,

06:51.044 --> 06:53.411
but it won't be like this for too long.

06:53.446 --> 06:56.530
I promise you. I will
find a way to fix this.

06:56.983 --> 06:58.702
Okay.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.086
I love you.

07:03.226 --> 07:05.156
I love you, too, Starfish.

07:18.838 --> 07:21.606
Samdi?

07:23.510 --> 07:25.143
Are you in here?

07:32.752 --> 07:34.786
Facilier?

07:58.511 --> 07:59.744
Gold.

08:02.417 --> 08:03.915
What happened to you?

08:03.950 --> 08:05.950
Did Facilier do this?

08:11.858 --> 08:14.959
I'm sorry, Regina.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.228
Facilier's dead.

08:19.065 --> 08:23.167
I'm afraid my alter
ego from the Wish Realm

08:23.203 --> 08:25.236
made an unexpected appearance.

08:27.703 --> 08:29.136
He's here?

08:31.611 --> 08:33.244
What the hell does he want?

08:35.708 --> 08:38.049
Wow! They look delicious, Luce.

08:38.083 --> 08:40.351
They're to make up for all
the celebrations we missed

08:40.385 --> 08:42.754
because of the curse.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.356
So, is everyone ready to make a wish?

08:45.391 --> 08:46.924
You know, this whole
story started years ago

08:46.960 --> 08:48.159
with a wish on a cupcake.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.562
When my mom wished not to be
alone and we were reunited.

08:51.598 --> 08:56.367
And now, finally, I'm
reunited with my family.

08:56.402 --> 08:58.302
Honestly, I don't even
know what to wish for,

08:58.338 --> 09:00.772
because I just got
everything I could ever want.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.440
Me too.

09:04.511 --> 09:05.610
All right.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.078
Here we go.

09:13.759 --> 09:15.219
Ella?

09:15.255 --> 09:16.988
Lucy?

09:17.023 --> 09:19.703
I'm afraid you're not gonna
be able to find them, Dearie.

09:19.728 --> 09:22.627
At least not without my help.

09:22.662 --> 09:24.162
What happened?

09:24.197 --> 09:26.297
Where are my family?
What did you do to them?

09:26.332 --> 09:28.266
Well, I sent them back to my home.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.867
In the Wish Realm.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.992
Rather ironic, don't you think?

09:32.017 --> 09:35.830
An entire world created by a wish.

09:36.442 --> 09:39.177
They can be quite powerful things.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.479
Why are you doing
this? What do you want?!

09:41.514 --> 09:43.514
I know you don't remember,

09:43.550 --> 09:45.983
but I warned a younger
version of you once.

09:46.019 --> 09:49.687
That you'd never get your
happy ending without my help.

09:49.722 --> 09:52.657
So now I'm gonna prove my point.

09:52.692 --> 09:55.293
- How?
- By striking a deal, of course.

09:55.328 --> 09:58.029
If you ever want to
see your family again,

09:58.064 --> 10:01.666
you're gonna get me something I want.

10:01.701 --> 10:05.269
My lesser half's copy
of the Dark One Dagger.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.540
H-He's determined to
surrender his dagger

10:09.576 --> 10:12.944
to some "guardian," and
I can't let that happen.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.802
It won't just destroy
his power, you see?

10:15.827 --> 10:17.861
It'll destroy mine, too.

10:18.724 --> 10:22.353
Love has poisoned him.

10:22.388 --> 10:26.224
Love is a weakness, and he's infected.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.226
What makes you think I can get it?

10:28.261 --> 10:29.994
That I would get it?

10:30.029 --> 10:34.031
I think we both know the
answer to that, Dearie.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.000
You're motivated.

10:36.035 --> 10:39.036
I prey on desperate souls, remember?

10:39.072 --> 10:41.706
And right now, with your family gone,

10:41.741 --> 10:44.876
that soul is you.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.407
Sounds like this Rumplestiltskin

11:00.442 --> 11:01.975
is even more dangerous than the last,

11:02.011 --> 11:03.045
if he got the better of you.

11:03.070 --> 11:04.824
Ah, his victory is temporary.

11:04.849 --> 11:05.983
My revenge won't be.

11:06.008 --> 11:07.574
Our revenge.

11:08.217 --> 11:09.983
You're not the only one he hurt today.

11:10.052 --> 11:11.385
To revenge, then.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.053
A companion we all know far too well.

11:14.123 --> 11:15.355
I'm glad I found you.

11:15.391 --> 11:17.906
Henry. What's wrong?

11:17.931 --> 11:20.994
Rumplestiltskin took Lucy and Ella.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.755
He said he's gonna keep them
in the Wish Realm until I...

11:23.994 --> 11:25.927
until I give him the Dark One Dagger.

11:28.395 --> 11:29.895
I should have seen this coming.

11:31.098 --> 11:32.764
You don't have to worry, Henry.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.501
We're gonna get your
family back. Together.

11:35.536 --> 11:37.603
So, what are you suggesting?
I give up the dagger?

11:37.638 --> 11:39.104
No, of course not.

11:39.140 --> 11:41.340
We don't negotiate with villains.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.408
We kick ass and protect
the people we love.

11:44.678 --> 11:46.712
That would actually make
a pretty good family motto.

11:46.747 --> 11:49.381
But right now, my family
is stuck in the Wish Realm,

11:49.416 --> 11:50.649
and we have no way to get to them.

11:50.684 --> 11:53.285
Whoa, whoa. Don't be so sure about that.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.287
The Wish Realm was my home port,

11:55.322 --> 11:57.087
and I may have a route back.

11:59.860 --> 12:02.227
I never thought I'd say this again.

12:04.565 --> 12:07.032
Captain Hook is ready to go back home.

12:13.707 --> 12:15.474
There you are.

12:15.509 --> 12:18.377
Thought you'd be out celebrating.

12:19.547 --> 12:21.680
The curse is broken, Your Majesty.

12:21.715 --> 12:24.683
People should be
cooking beignets for you.

12:25.619 --> 12:28.487
Cooking helps me clear my head.

12:28.827 --> 12:30.856
Or at least it used to help Sabine.

12:32.826 --> 12:35.227
It's a crazy thing, isn't it?

12:35.435 --> 12:37.369
Remembering who you really are.

12:37.394 --> 12:39.828
But that is just it...

12:40.069 --> 12:41.710
I don't know who I am.

12:42.380 --> 12:43.802
I mean, yesterday, I was Sabine,

12:43.837 --> 12:47.105
and all I had to worry about
was the price of butter.

12:47.141 --> 12:51.510
And then the curse breaks,
and now I'm Tiana, and...

12:51.868 --> 12:53.879
I was a...

12:53.914 --> 12:55.047
I mean, I was...

12:55.082 --> 12:56.481
A queen.

12:56.866 --> 12:58.944
It's okay to say it.

12:59.753 --> 13:02.413
Well, I sure don't feel like one.

13:03.757 --> 13:06.858
A real queen would be out
there helping her people,

13:06.894 --> 13:10.562
and I'm hiding in here, stress baking.

13:10.598 --> 13:12.431
I mean, I was cursed a really long time.

13:12.466 --> 13:15.701
Maybe I just... forgot how to be Tiana.

13:15.736 --> 13:19.171
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

13:19.206 --> 13:21.017
Did you forget yesterday?

13:22.587 --> 13:26.945
You can call yourself Sabine
or Tiana or anything you want,

13:27.361 --> 13:28.914
but the woman who
risked her life for me...

13:28.949 --> 13:31.550
That was a queen.

13:31.919 --> 13:33.585
It's my queen.

13:35.062 --> 13:38.264
You always did have a way
with words, Prince Naveen.

13:38.292 --> 13:40.525
Mm.

13:40.561 --> 13:43.595
The good news is, Rogers was right.

13:43.631 --> 13:45.931
Alice did have a looking
glass in her boxcar.

13:45.966 --> 13:47.266
Amongst other things.

13:47.301 --> 13:49.167
Well, my daughter was always a pack rat.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.870
- What's the bad news?
- Well, it's cracked.

13:51.905 --> 13:54.406
Which means it's possible
its magic may not work.

13:54.441 --> 13:56.408
Well, there's only one way to find out.

13:56.443 --> 13:58.210
As long as you understand.

13:58.245 --> 13:59.611
Taking on this Rumplestiltskin

13:59.647 --> 14:01.780
in his own patch won't
be a walk in the park.

14:01.815 --> 14:03.248
He'll make sure of that.

14:03.284 --> 14:05.217
You think he's expecting us?

14:05.252 --> 14:06.618
Well, I would.

14:06.654 --> 14:08.487
And I'd prepare something unpleasant.

14:08.904 --> 14:10.756
Well, hey, listen.

14:10.791 --> 14:12.024
Maybe I should do this alone.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.659
Stop it, Henry.

14:13.694 --> 14:15.494
You're not leaving your mother behind.

14:16.075 --> 14:18.068
We're all with you till the end.

14:24.672 --> 14:27.839
All right, one last grand adventure.

14:27.875 --> 14:29.341
Let's go get your family.

14:40.054 --> 14:41.987
Hook?!

14:42.022 --> 14:43.855
Gold?!

14:43.891 --> 14:46.124
What happened to them?

14:46.538 --> 14:48.527
I'm not sure.

14:49.108 --> 14:51.430
But we've got bigger
things to worry about.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.532
Where are we?

14:53.567 --> 14:56.201
Rumple's castle.

14:56.236 --> 14:58.270
The Wish Realm edition.

14:58.305 --> 15:00.972
Looks a lot darker than the original.

15:01.008 --> 15:03.308
By the looks of it, a
few things have changed

15:03.344 --> 15:05.077
since the last time I was...

15:07.881 --> 15:10.549
- here.
- Yes, they certainly have.

15:14.021 --> 15:16.521
Peter Pan?

15:16.557 --> 15:18.290
What happened to you?

15:18.325 --> 15:19.458
What happened to this land?

15:19.493 --> 15:20.959
My son happened.

15:20.994 --> 15:23.995
He never forgives, and he never forgets.

15:24.031 --> 15:25.438
Guess neither of us grew up.

15:25.463 --> 15:26.798
Your son took my family.

15:26.834 --> 15:28.300
I need to know where they are.

15:28.335 --> 15:31.103
Your guess is as good as mine.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.205
But I recommend you abandon all hope

15:33.240 --> 15:35.019
of finding them and leave.

15:35.044 --> 15:38.841
Because while good things
come into my son's castle...

15:39.731 --> 15:41.398
they never come out.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.815
Still no sign of Roni or Henry.

15:53.862 --> 15:55.837
And if this place is
part of the Wish Realm,

15:55.872 --> 15:57.405
I've certainly never been to it.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.473
Well, I can't account for the others,

16:01.311 --> 16:03.945
but I know exactly where we are.

16:03.980 --> 16:05.934
This is my old home.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.006
Or at least this realm's version of it.

16:09.031 --> 16:11.986
I never wanted to see this place again.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.951
Which is why we're here.

16:16.987 --> 16:19.254
This Rumple's pushing buttons.

16:19.289 --> 16:21.022
He cracked Tilly's looking glass

16:21.057 --> 16:23.705
to manipulate exactly
where we all ended up.

16:24.298 --> 16:26.247
And this detour is meant to?

16:30.500 --> 16:34.135
To remind me of when I became a coward.

16:39.058 --> 16:41.509
I used this to hobble myself

16:41.725 --> 16:44.726
to avoid fighting in the Ogre's War.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.617
But this is one battle
I won't back away from.

16:49.653 --> 16:51.085
If this Rumplestiltskin wants a fight,

16:51.121 --> 16:52.420
that's exactly what he's gonna get.

16:52.455 --> 16:54.856
Hey, look. You tried that once before,

16:54.891 --> 16:57.859
and you ended up as insulation
in a voodoo doctor's wall.

16:57.894 --> 17:00.295
So, what do you propose we do?

17:00.330 --> 17:01.996
This realm is my home.

17:02.304 --> 17:05.137
I know a place where
we can go to get help.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.772
My old hideout.

17:11.808 --> 17:14.175
I-I know. It's a bit cluttered.

17:14.211 --> 17:15.843
But it is beachfront property.

17:16.430 --> 17:18.946
All this created by a wish.

17:18.982 --> 17:21.015
Well, we're all created somehow.

17:21.050 --> 17:23.251
Make no mistake, I'm as real as you.

17:23.286 --> 17:25.053
I wouldn't dare suggest otherwise.

17:25.088 --> 17:26.588
Good. Because the Wish version of you

17:26.623 --> 17:28.690
seems to be creating real
problems for everyone here.

17:28.725 --> 17:30.525
Can we get to the solution you promised?

17:30.560 --> 17:34.028
Because all I see is a cave
where booze goes to perish.

17:34.958 --> 17:36.536
Truth is,

17:37.544 --> 17:39.634
this is where I came to do the same.

17:41.838 --> 17:45.540
I gave up on ever being
reunited with Alice.

17:45.575 --> 17:46.908
If it wasn't for a good friend,

17:46.943 --> 17:49.677
I might never have charted
the right course again.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.367
Ariel.

18:12.402 --> 18:15.270
Many years, and pounds, have passed

18:15.305 --> 18:17.005
since I last saw you, Captain.

18:17.492 --> 18:18.773
Look out!

18:18.808 --> 18:19.907
The Dark One!

18:23.242 --> 18:26.447
Perhaps you should bring your
fish-tailed friend up to speed.

18:26.483 --> 18:29.317
Uh, short version, Ariel...

18:29.352 --> 18:31.252
Looks like the villain, but isn't.

18:31.288 --> 18:33.757
The truth is, I'm here
to help rid this place

18:33.782 --> 18:37.191
of the Rumple you rightly fear.

18:37.227 --> 18:40.194
We were hoping that you might
be able to give us an advantage.

18:40.230 --> 18:41.392
You don't happen to have some squid ink

18:41.412 --> 18:43.179
that would could use to defeat our foe?

18:43.743 --> 18:47.216
I may have saved a few drops.

18:51.704 --> 18:53.370
Use it wisely, Hook.

18:54.844 --> 18:56.930
There are a lot of lives at stake.

19:04.083 --> 19:06.669
Maybe this is the wrong place.

19:06.704 --> 19:08.938
If Wish Rumple really
had Ella and Lucy here,

19:08.973 --> 19:10.973
why isn't it guarded?

19:12.247 --> 19:15.311
I think you may have spoken too soon.

19:15.346 --> 19:18.481
Never took the Dark
One for an animal lover.

19:18.516 --> 19:22.885
Let's not confuse who
tugs the leash 'round here.

19:22.921 --> 19:25.254
Hello, darling.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.124
Cruella De Vil.

19:28.462 --> 19:32.094
Well, I thought you were
above being Rumple's lapdog.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.263
I'm not anyone's anything.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.165
I was just promised a couple of new furs

19:36.201 --> 19:37.333
for a fun evening of killing

19:37.368 --> 19:40.002
whoever came knocking at the door.

19:40.038 --> 19:42.638
Oh, then again,

19:42.674 --> 19:44.240
perhaps we can strike a bargain

19:44.275 --> 19:46.876
for you to be my chew toy.

19:46.911 --> 19:50.613
Fancy a little, uh, scratch
behind the ear, darling?

19:50.648 --> 19:52.481
Twisted's not really my type.

19:55.453 --> 19:57.353
Your loss.

19:57.388 --> 19:59.055
I got this.

20:27.251 --> 20:29.185
I mean, surely, such a noble group

20:29.220 --> 20:32.421
wouldn't murder an unarmed woman, hmm?

20:32.457 --> 20:34.724
Oh, no, of course not.

20:34.759 --> 20:37.526
But we would certainly
tighten your leash.

20:42.100 --> 20:45.167
Now, be a good girl

20:45.203 --> 20:49.234
and tell me where Rumple put
Henry's wife and daughter.

20:50.758 --> 20:53.019
Your little mutts are in the dungeon.

20:53.044 --> 20:56.045
But knowing where they
are and freeing them

20:56.080 --> 20:58.547
is a completely different animal.

21:10.295 --> 21:11.694
I hear their voices.

21:19.096 --> 21:20.236
Daddy!

21:20.271 --> 21:21.937
Ella! Lucy!

21:21.973 --> 21:23.439
Daddy!

21:23.474 --> 21:25.474
Daddy, help us, please!

21:25.510 --> 21:27.910
Yes.

21:27.945 --> 21:29.945
Well, you wanted a happy ending.

21:29.981 --> 21:32.448
Now you can stick yours on a shelf.

21:32.483 --> 21:35.017
You magicked them in.
I can magic them out.

21:35.053 --> 21:37.787
Wrong, Dearie. This
bauble is unbreakable.

21:37.822 --> 21:40.022
No one can set them free but me.

21:40.058 --> 21:43.592
And given that I don't want
to, inside, they shall stay.

21:43.628 --> 21:44.994
They don't deserve this.

21:45.029 --> 21:47.229
You've only got yourself to blame.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.165
I told you you'd get your family back

21:49.200 --> 21:50.566
when you brought me the dagger.

21:50.601 --> 21:53.336
But you tried to cheat
the terms of our deal.

21:53.371 --> 21:56.054
My grandfather needs that
dagger to get back to Belle.

21:56.079 --> 21:57.773
I can't trade my happy ending for his.

21:57.809 --> 21:58.808
It's not right.

21:58.843 --> 22:00.209
Blah, blah, blah.

22:00.244 --> 22:02.712
Blathering your misguided nonsense!

22:02.747 --> 22:06.282
And you want to trade
your happiness for his.

22:06.317 --> 22:08.349
And people say I'm crazy.

22:09.146 --> 22:11.520
We're not trading anything.

22:11.556 --> 22:13.856
We'll figure out another
way to get them out.

22:13.891 --> 22:15.991
Yeah, maybe you will, maybe you won't.

22:16.027 --> 22:17.460
But the real question is,

22:17.495 --> 22:19.795
will you do so in time?

22:22.400 --> 22:23.466
What?

22:23.501 --> 22:25.301
Dad.

22:25.336 --> 22:26.302
What have you done?

22:26.337 --> 22:28.037
Added some incentive.

22:28.072 --> 22:31.073
The globe will be filled
with snow by midnight.

22:31.109 --> 22:32.541
And in this fairy tale,

22:32.577 --> 22:35.511
your Cinderella won't
lose a coach or a dress.

22:35.546 --> 22:40.316
She and your daughter
will lose their lives.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.516
Mom, stop. You're making it worse.

22:58.552 --> 23:00.084
It's going to be fine, Henry.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.974
They're freezing in there.

23:05.009 --> 23:06.742
I'll find a way to get them out.

23:08.413 --> 23:11.414
It may not be quite as simple as that.

23:12.128 --> 23:14.217
The magic that created this prison

23:14.252 --> 23:16.548
cannot be undone like that.

23:16.573 --> 23:18.554
The only way to free your family

23:19.606 --> 23:21.592
is by going after
Rumplestiltskin himself.

23:21.627 --> 23:24.495
No. No, he'll just
make it worse for them.

23:24.530 --> 23:26.130
You don't want to use
your mother's magic

23:26.165 --> 23:27.197
or your grandfather's plan.

23:27.233 --> 23:28.732
What do you suggest, mate?

23:28.768 --> 23:32.736
I suggest that we consider
the one sure way to save them.

23:32.772 --> 23:34.149
No.

23:34.174 --> 23:36.673
We give up the dagger if it's
the only way to save my family.

23:36.709 --> 23:38.175
- It's not an option.
- Why not?

23:38.210 --> 23:39.710
Because I seem to remember
that you were willing

23:39.745 --> 23:42.446
to cast a curse when it came
to taking care of your own son.

23:42.481 --> 23:44.014
Henry. You're better than that.

23:44.049 --> 23:45.249
Maybe.

23:45.284 --> 23:47.618
But maybe it's time that
we all ask ourselves...

23:47.653 --> 23:49.553
Who really deserves their happy ending?

23:50.589 --> 23:51.789
Oh.

23:51.824 --> 23:54.308
You're letting your
emotions cloud your judgment.

23:55.394 --> 23:58.162
The Captain and I have
already found a way

23:58.197 --> 24:00.130
to gain the upper hand.

24:00.353 --> 24:03.620
So you stay here, and
I'll deal with him.

24:07.273 --> 24:08.939
We're just letting him go?

24:08.974 --> 24:10.973
What if he's really going to
cut his own deal with Rumple?

24:10.998 --> 24:12.709
I'll go with him. Make
sure he's stays honest.

24:12.745 --> 24:14.044
You don't have any magic.

24:14.079 --> 24:15.179
I'll go.

24:17.316 --> 24:19.476
There's a library in this castle.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.586
Find a spell that'll
work on that snow globe...

24:22.769 --> 24:24.611
before it's too late.

25:16.876 --> 25:19.109
We really do hate this place.

25:19.144 --> 25:21.879
Bane of our existence, Dearie.

25:21.914 --> 25:25.482
And yet, after everything
we've been through to escape it,

25:25.517 --> 25:27.885
all you want to do is give up our power

25:27.920 --> 25:30.420
and drag us right back.

25:33.025 --> 25:36.093
Might as well hobble
both our legs this time.

25:36.128 --> 25:39.129
I didn't come here to revisit history.

25:39.164 --> 25:40.697
Or repeat it.

25:40.733 --> 25:42.032
Of course.

25:42.067 --> 25:43.367
I know that.

25:43.402 --> 25:44.534
I know you.

25:44.570 --> 25:46.503
I am you.

25:46.538 --> 25:49.506
You're looking for a
loophole to help your grandson

25:49.541 --> 25:53.343
and his family escape
their frosty predicament.

25:53.379 --> 25:57.714
Well, perhaps you don't
know me... or yourself...

25:57.750 --> 25:59.116
Quite as well as you think.

26:00.719 --> 26:03.954
That's not the loophole
I'm here to discuss.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.420
Really?

26:12.765 --> 26:15.599
I've been trying to rid
myself of my copy of the dagger

26:15.634 --> 26:18.001
for quite some time now.

26:18.037 --> 26:20.771
And every time I try
to do it the right way,

26:20.806 --> 26:23.140
by giving it to someone pure,

26:23.175 --> 26:25.075
it's always a burden.

26:25.110 --> 26:27.678
A corrupting force.

26:27.713 --> 26:30.080
And foisting that onto an innocent?

26:30.115 --> 26:32.149
Well, that can never be right.

26:32.184 --> 26:34.985
Indeed. That is a sticky wicket.

26:35.020 --> 26:40.390
But you... you want the darkness.

26:40.426 --> 26:44.227
Giving it to you, I'm not spreading it,

26:44.263 --> 26:46.563
I'm not burdening anyone.

26:46.598 --> 26:48.598
I think the real loophole

26:48.634 --> 26:50.901
I've been looking for all this time...

26:51.450 --> 26:52.936
is you.

26:54.512 --> 26:56.707
So...

26:56.742 --> 27:02.145
you want to make a deal
and give me the dagger now.

27:02.181 --> 27:04.681
What could possibly have changed?

27:04.717 --> 27:07.584
Well, I've finally
realized the one enemy

27:07.619 --> 27:09.886
I can never defeat...

27:09.922 --> 27:11.929
is myself.

27:12.804 --> 27:17.828
So you take the dagger

27:18.296 --> 27:21.031
and all the darkness that goes with it,

27:21.382 --> 27:23.433
and I get to go free

27:23.617 --> 27:26.317
and get the happy ending I deserve.

27:29.541 --> 27:32.776
Well, it's not exactly
the way I expected this

27:32.811 --> 27:34.778
to play out, but I'll take it.

27:40.285 --> 27:41.785
Squid ink.

27:45.190 --> 27:47.758
Now who's weak?

27:47.793 --> 27:49.826
This can't hold me for long.

27:49.862 --> 27:52.095
It doesn't have to.

27:52.131 --> 27:54.564
You see, you made a miscalculation

27:54.600 --> 27:56.199
bringing me here.

27:56.235 --> 27:58.668
It did remind me of my weakness,

27:58.704 --> 28:01.204
but not because of that hammer.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.006
Because of you.

28:04.443 --> 28:09.155
You see, without Belle, you
are just a pathetic beast

28:09.180 --> 28:11.930
who needs to be put out of his misery.

28:12.727 --> 28:15.018
And I'm the only one who can do it.

28:15.054 --> 28:16.386
You do that,

28:16.422 --> 28:20.957
and you will never see
your precious Belle again.

28:20.993 --> 28:24.461
If that means ridding the realms of you,

28:24.496 --> 28:27.364
that's a risk I'm willing to take.

28:29.701 --> 28:30.834
Regina!

28:30.869 --> 28:32.002
What the hell are you doing?

28:32.037 --> 28:33.870
Get out of here.

28:34.186 --> 28:35.305
Too late.

28:35.340 --> 28:37.808
Impeccable timing, Dearie.

28:42.815 --> 28:48.185
That dagger was never
why I was after Henry.

28:48.220 --> 28:49.653
What?

28:49.688 --> 28:51.521
Haven't you figured it out?

28:51.557 --> 28:55.192
Thought the hammer would
have jogged your memory.

28:55.598 --> 28:59.640
The day we hobbled
ourselves, we met a seer,

28:59.954 --> 29:03.255
and she gave us a prophecy.

29:04.503 --> 29:08.004
Beware, Rumplestiltskin.

29:08.040 --> 29:10.974
The boy will be my undoing.

29:11.009 --> 29:13.276
Yes.

29:13.312 --> 29:15.045
And today's the day

29:15.080 --> 29:18.682
that prophecy finally comes to pass.

29:32.498 --> 29:35.829
I think I just figured out
a way to save my family...

29:36.502 --> 29:38.301
without handing over the dagger.

29:38.337 --> 29:39.469
Well, that's great news.

29:39.505 --> 29:40.804
Well, what... what do we need to do?

29:40.839 --> 29:41.838
There's no time. I have to go.

29:41.874 --> 29:43.073
Yeah, of course. I'm coming with you.

29:43.108 --> 29:44.174
No, I can do this on my own.

29:44.209 --> 29:45.342
But you don't have to.

29:45.377 --> 29:46.843
No, you're not doing this alone.

29:48.714 --> 29:50.213
I was afraid you'd say that.

29:54.654 --> 29:56.186
I'm sorry, but if you
knew where I was going,

29:56.221 --> 29:57.487
you wouldn't help.

29:57.523 --> 30:00.690
You'd try to stop me.

30:00.726 --> 30:03.126
And no one is stopping me.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.533
Turn around, brigand.

30:26.270 --> 30:28.122
Do not be fooled.

30:28.700 --> 30:32.279
I am blind, but my sword is still sharp.

30:32.322 --> 30:33.988
I can see that.

30:34.016 --> 30:35.036
And you can put it down.

30:35.061 --> 30:36.727
I'm not here to fight.

30:37.252 --> 30:40.420
I'm here for the Author's pen.

30:41.836 --> 30:43.693
You should be warned, lad...

30:44.217 --> 30:47.051
That pen is a dangerous thing.

30:47.086 --> 30:48.853
I know all about it.

30:48.888 --> 30:50.121
And I don't care.

30:50.156 --> 30:52.189
I care.

30:52.492 --> 30:55.760
I have fought many a
battle protecting it,

30:55.785 --> 30:59.220
some of which have cost me a great deal.

31:00.737 --> 31:02.366
But I will not relinquish it

31:02.402 --> 31:04.735
to anyone other than a True Author.

31:04.771 --> 31:06.671
And there hasn't been
one of those in this realm

31:06.706 --> 31:08.172
for a very long time.

31:08.207 --> 31:10.374
I'm not from this realm.

31:10.410 --> 31:13.411
Look, it's a long and complicated story,

31:13.446 --> 31:15.179
but basically, in another land,

31:15.214 --> 31:16.847
I am the True Author.

31:16.883 --> 31:18.215
Now, I need my pen,

31:18.251 --> 31:19.817
so whatever test you
have to put me through

31:19.852 --> 31:21.585
to figure that out, do it.

31:23.336 --> 31:25.045
As you wish.

31:36.769 --> 31:40.308
That is indeed a complicated story.

31:41.573 --> 31:44.130
The timelines alone,

31:44.155 --> 31:46.635
they make one's head spin.

31:47.948 --> 31:52.216
Only a True Author
would weave such a tale.

31:52.897 --> 31:54.919
So, what? So, that's the test?

31:54.954 --> 31:56.153
It is.

31:56.189 --> 31:58.923
You see, every story an
Author has ever written

31:58.958 --> 32:01.223
lives in his heart.

32:02.161 --> 32:04.328
You have done good work.

32:05.926 --> 32:09.066
Could use a little more
romance, perhaps, but...

32:09.102 --> 32:11.202
maybe in your next book.

32:11.237 --> 32:12.837
So then I passed?

32:12.872 --> 32:15.406
It is an honor to meet you.

32:15.698 --> 32:17.093
Likewise.

32:17.578 --> 32:19.877
So. Where's the pen?

32:19.912 --> 32:22.113
In its rightful place.

32:22.468 --> 32:24.415
Look to your hand.

32:33.298 --> 32:34.531
Thank you.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.896
I noticed you haven't
written in quite some time.

32:38.931 --> 32:41.098
So I must remind you...

32:41.134 --> 32:44.802
The Author's true job
is to record the stories,

32:44.837 --> 32:46.904
not to create them.

32:47.302 --> 32:49.640
So no matter how many stories
you have already written,

32:49.675 --> 32:54.627
you must choose each time
how you will use the pen.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.409
Choose wisely...

32:58.518 --> 33:00.050
Henry.

33:11.397 --> 33:13.164
Ugh!

33:13.199 --> 33:14.598
Finally.

33:14.634 --> 33:17.935
It's filthy in here, and
Dalmatian is a bitch to clean.

33:17.970 --> 33:19.470
Try a dry cleaners.

33:19.505 --> 33:20.604
I'm not gonna let you out,

33:20.640 --> 33:22.540
but you do have something I need.

33:22.575 --> 33:25.075
This pen requires a special kind of ink

33:25.111 --> 33:26.744
that's pretty hard to find.

33:26.779 --> 33:29.213
But I happen to know the
one place it still exists.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.119
No.

33:35.154 --> 33:36.854
No!

33:36.889 --> 33:39.490
No, no, no, no, no!

33:39.525 --> 33:40.724
No!

33:44.931 --> 33:46.831
Ohhh!

33:46.866 --> 33:49.567
I will skin you alive for this!

33:55.942 --> 33:57.741
I'll take that.

33:58.978 --> 34:00.611
And that.

34:02.448 --> 34:03.614
You see?

34:03.649 --> 34:04.949
Press the right buttons,

34:04.984 --> 34:07.218
and anyone will do what you want.

34:07.253 --> 34:09.652
Even the Truest Believer.

34:09.688 --> 34:11.822
You were after the pen.

34:11.858 --> 34:13.190
Plot twist.

34:13.226 --> 34:16.293
Well, whatever you have
planned, it won't work.

34:16.329 --> 34:17.962
Only the Author can use it.

34:17.996 --> 34:19.496
And I don't care what you do to me.

34:19.532 --> 34:20.764
I'll never write a word for you.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.733
But I will.

34:24.186 --> 34:25.636
Hello, Henry.

34:25.670 --> 34:26.904
You're...

34:26.938 --> 34:28.706
you're Wish Realm Me.

34:28.741 --> 34:30.107
Surprised?

34:30.141 --> 34:32.042
There's versions of other characters.

34:32.250 --> 34:34.050
Why shouldn't there be two of us?

34:35.915 --> 34:37.281
If you're any version of me,

34:37.315 --> 34:38.916
you should know that this is wrong.

34:39.237 --> 34:41.284
I am you.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.954
Except for one difference.

34:43.989 --> 34:46.190
None of my wishes ever came true.

34:47.270 --> 34:48.859
You made a deal with him.

34:48.895 --> 34:50.860
Well, it's what I do.

34:50.897 --> 34:52.830
When you said I wouldn't
get my happy ending

34:52.864 --> 34:55.266
without your help, you
weren't talking about me.

34:55.534 --> 34:57.835
You were talking about him.

34:58.212 --> 35:00.604
Po-tay-toh. Po-tat-toh.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.340
How could you do this?

35:03.913 --> 35:07.819
I tried finding my
happiness the right way,

35:08.702 --> 35:10.547
but I got desperate.

35:10.864 --> 35:12.664
Looks like you did, too.

35:15.755 --> 35:17.922
And now that we've
gotten to know each other,

35:17.957 --> 35:20.591
what do you say, Henries?

35:20.626 --> 35:23.661
I think it's time we
started a new story.

35:24.180 --> 35:26.035
Mine.

35:35.341 --> 35:37.174
Oh, God.

35:37.209 --> 35:38.175
Henry.

35:39.912 --> 35:41.211
Your Majesty.

35:41.247 --> 35:43.380
It's been a while since
you killed my grandparents

35:43.416 --> 35:44.715
with your bare hands.

35:44.750 --> 35:46.916
Back to try and finish off the family?

35:46.941 --> 35:48.685
Oh, no, no, no, no. That wasn't...

35:48.721 --> 35:51.588
Such pain. Such anger. I'm riveted.

35:51.624 --> 35:53.533
Aren't you riveted?

35:54.462 --> 35:56.393
No.

35:56.429 --> 35:57.828
The Author's pen.

35:57.863 --> 35:58.962
How?

35:58.998 --> 36:01.632
I screwed up, big-time.

36:01.667 --> 36:03.100
Hook, I'm sorry I hit you.

36:03.135 --> 36:04.201
Mom, I'm just...

36:05.638 --> 36:07.204
I'm sorry.

36:07.239 --> 36:08.505
What's he gonna write?

36:08.541 --> 36:10.541
Look, whatever deal you made with him,

36:10.576 --> 36:12.009
you do not have to honor it.

36:12.044 --> 36:14.912
Trust me, there's always a loophole.

36:14.947 --> 36:16.480
And I'll help you find it.

36:16.515 --> 36:19.716
Why would I break a deal that's
gonna give me what I want?

36:19.752 --> 36:21.185
Smart boy.

36:21.220 --> 36:25.396
And now we must attend
to my humble needs.

36:25.834 --> 36:29.059
We have immortality
and power, you and I,

36:29.094 --> 36:31.995
and you want to throw it
all away for both of us

36:32.031 --> 36:34.765
just to get to Belle.

36:34.800 --> 36:37.401
Well, I'm afraid, in the
stroke of a pen, Dearie,

36:37.917 --> 36:42.139
I'm gonna make sure
you never see her again.

36:45.811 --> 36:47.244
Don't do this.

36:47.279 --> 36:48.512
We can help you.

36:48.547 --> 36:50.247
This isn't the right path for you.

36:50.282 --> 36:51.248
You know that.

36:51.283 --> 36:53.250
Take a letter, boy.

36:53.285 --> 36:55.285
It goes something like this.

36:56.422 --> 36:58.589
"The powers of the Guardian"...

36:58.624 --> 36:59.623
No. No, no, no.

36:59.658 --> 37:01.725
"are no more."

37:06.896 --> 37:08.470
Done.

37:13.372 --> 37:14.671
Well written.

37:14.707 --> 37:17.741
My eternity feels eternal again.

37:17.776 --> 37:18.809
Oh, oh, oh!

37:18.844 --> 37:20.652
And now...

37:22.043 --> 37:24.948
enjoy a taste of winter
in your tiny prison.

37:26.752 --> 37:29.887
Henry! Where'd they go?

37:29.922 --> 37:32.923
I reunited Henry and the
others with his family.

37:32.958 --> 37:35.025
Bound to be quite the reunion.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.928
Then why am I still here?

37:37.963 --> 37:42.640
Because we're finally back to
what I'm getting out of this.

37:43.210 --> 37:46.236
I watched you crush
my grandparents' hearts

37:46.272 --> 37:48.725
and take away my mom.

37:49.857 --> 37:52.576
And that story still needs its ending.

37:56.549 --> 37:58.482
Oh, look.

37:58.517 --> 38:00.517
There's a one-bedroom
right here in the Heights.

38:00.553 --> 38:02.452
Oh, it looks pretty good
in the pictures. See?

38:02.488 --> 38:03.820
I don't need to see it.

38:03.856 --> 38:05.656
I love it.

38:05.691 --> 38:08.625
If it comes with a built-in
Margot, that's all I need.

38:08.661 --> 38:11.028
Aww.

38:11.063 --> 38:12.729
Uh...

38:12.765 --> 38:14.464
Tilly! Are you okay?

38:14.500 --> 38:15.465
What's wrong?

38:15.501 --> 38:17.034
I don't know.

38:17.069 --> 38:18.569
- Something's changed.
- What?

38:18.604 --> 38:19.803
My father and the others, they're...

38:19.838 --> 38:20.871
they're in danger.

38:20.906 --> 38:22.039
Something's wrong in the Wish Realm.

38:22.074 --> 38:24.007
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. We have to go.

38:24.043 --> 38:25.509
They need our help.

38:27.580 --> 38:28.745
I'm sorry.

38:28.781 --> 38:31.348
There's not enough
beignet magic in the world

38:31.383 --> 38:32.549
to open a portal.

38:32.574 --> 38:34.679
No, you must have something.

38:34.815 --> 38:36.520
Maybe, as queen...

38:36.555 --> 38:38.622
you can help us find some magic?

38:39.329 --> 38:40.687
Right.

38:41.091 --> 38:42.930
Queen.

38:48.567 --> 38:50.867
Folks. Please listen.

38:50.903 --> 38:54.237
Our people, o-our friends
are in trouble and...

38:59.784 --> 39:02.652
Hey! Everyone, listen up.

39:07.436 --> 39:10.754
These two young women
are known to many of you.

39:10.789 --> 39:13.123
They need to get to the
Wish Realm to help others,

39:13.158 --> 39:15.926
perhaps even save lives.

39:15.961 --> 39:18.862
You may not feel that
you can help, but...

39:19.951 --> 39:21.562
I think you can.

39:23.469 --> 39:26.403
You may have a pair of silver slippers

39:26.438 --> 39:29.873
or a magic hat or a bean,

39:29.908 --> 39:32.643
something you haven't
thought of in years.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.856
Find it.

39:35.637 --> 39:37.401
Your realm needs you.

39:40.471 --> 39:43.205
Your queen needs you.

39:51.997 --> 39:53.797
Your Majesty?

39:54.213 --> 39:55.446
Remy?

39:55.471 --> 39:56.733
Do you have something?

39:56.769 --> 39:58.802
Years ago, before the curse,

39:58.837 --> 40:01.562
I was preparing a cassoulet,

40:04.543 --> 40:06.209
and I found this.

40:07.867 --> 40:09.734
A magic bean.

40:10.849 --> 40:13.250
I-I hid it in case I ever needed it,

40:13.285 --> 40:16.920
but after what you just
said, I want you to have it.

40:23.073 --> 40:24.539
Thank you.

40:33.038 --> 40:35.472
- Do you want to come with us?
- Ah, no, thank you.

40:35.498 --> 40:37.999
I should stay here and
watch over my people.

40:38.477 --> 40:39.852
These are some strange times,

40:39.877 --> 40:42.707
and they need their queen right now.

40:44.049 --> 40:46.016
No, no curtsies or bows.

40:46.051 --> 40:47.084
Come on.

40:52.658 --> 40:53.757
All right.

40:56.361 --> 40:57.694
Thanks for the loan of the truck.

40:57.730 --> 40:59.296
Good luck in the other realm.

40:59.331 --> 41:00.831
Thanks. We may need it.

41:00.866 --> 41:03.366
But we're gonna make a quick stop first.

41:03.402 --> 41:05.235
Where? Where are you going?

41:05.270 --> 41:07.170
To get help from some friends.

41:32.273 --> 41:35.170
