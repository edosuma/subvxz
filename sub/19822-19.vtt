00:00.835 --> 00:02.101
(Anika) Then Tess got Bruhl

00:02.169 --> 00:03.669
to confess his plan
about taking your house

00:03.738 --> 00:05.270
right into the hidden camera.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.939
Then, she took off her
hood and Bruhl saw

00:07.008 --> 00:08.207
it was actually her and not Saganash,

00:08.275 --> 00:09.842
and went all, "What?"

00:09.910 --> 00:11.010
(laughter)

00:11.078 --> 00:12.611
Yo, Tess deserves an Oscar

00:12.680 --> 00:13.879
for that performance, all right?

00:13.948 --> 00:15.647
She was on fire! (all
laughing, shouting)

00:15.716 --> 00:18.484
<i>You all did a phenomenal job.</i>

00:18.552 --> 00:20.119
<i>I'm very proud of you.</i>

00:34.969 --> 00:36.335

00:36.404 --> 00:37.636
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

00:37.705 --> 00:39.772
<i>We'll be on the next

00:39.840 --> 00:42.741

see all of you again.</i>

00:42.810 --> 00:44.143

thinking about Sophie?

00:58.826 --> 01:00.125
Where do you think she is?

01:01.495 --> 01:03.228
(Max) Probably with her dad.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.864
Celebrating, after she
gave him the letter

01:05.933 --> 01:07.132
about the deed to our house.

01:07.201 --> 01:10.702
She wouldn't do that.
Maybe she's not with him.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.571
Maybe he kidnapped her.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.840
You think Saganash would
kidnap his own daughter?

01:14.909 --> 01:16.008
Yeah, right.

01:16.077 --> 01:18.210
Now he has the deed and
we have jack squat.

01:18.279 --> 01:21.013
Actually, that's not entirely true.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.048
I have the letter.

01:23.117 --> 01:26.051
I mean, I have a picture of the letter.

that the whole feud between the
Saganashes and the Hunters

02:55.442 --> 02:57.176
was based on a misunderstanding,

we could end this thing.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.415

He said, "Now I know where
the relatives are."

03:20.201 --> 03:22.935
How does he know that?
There was no location

03:23.003 --> 03:24.269

03:24.338 --> 03:25.804
I have no idea.

have the blue diamond,

03:38.686 --> 03:40.519
He didn't send her.

She ran away from him,

08:45.459 --> 08:47.025
Okay, look at the timing.

No one knew the relatives
had the diamond.

She goes back to her old
man, comes back here,

08:51.598 --> 08:53.765
gives us a little story, and

08:53.834 --> 08:55.400
This isn't Sophie's fault.

08:55.469 --> 08:57.335

08:58.605 --> 09:00.805
Yeah, correlation doesn't
imply causation.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.944
It means, just because two things

09:06.013 --> 09:08.013
happen one after another,
doesn't mean one

09:08.081 --> 09:10.615
is caused by the other.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.685
I... I think in this case, it does.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.186
What do you mean? You set us up?

09:15.255 --> 09:17.355
No! No, I would never do that.

diamond so we can get it back?

09:49.623 --> 09:52.290

They actually think

11:18.412 --> 11:19.978
I'm on their side.

11:20.047 --> 11:23.114

against my own father.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.417
<i>Why are you telling me this?</i>

11:25.485 --> 11:29.888
Um, just... just to let you know
that I am on... on your side.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.824

11:32.893 --> 11:35.894

just letting you know.

Yeah. Yeah, it is.

We still have the green
diamond, after all.

The green diamond?

12:41.628 --> 12:43.161
Oh, yeah.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.330
It's bigger than the blue one
and the red one put together.

12:45.398 --> 12:50.201

forgery of "The Night Watch"?

Would someone please tell
me what's going on here?

to test her? I sure did.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.881
And old Sophie here
just flunked the test

15:16.950 --> 15:18.883
worse than I ever did in any
of Miss Clutterby's classes.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.985
I didn't tell my dad anything...
Oh, don't even!

How else did he find out?
A little birdie?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.724

Did you tell him?

15:26.793 --> 15:28.426
No, I swear!

Well then, how did he find out?
I don't know!

I don't even blame you.

I trust you.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.689
You do? Why?

16:02.862 --> 16:05.530

16:05.598 --> 16:08.533

16:08.601 --> 16:10.201
Wait. Before you go,

16:10.270 --> 16:13.037

five minutes to fix it.

we're here, isn't it?

Pretty heavy tool.
