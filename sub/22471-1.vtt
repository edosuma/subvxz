09:27.167 --> 09:28.633
S... Steve.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.137
Okay... "Steve."

09:33.473 --> 09:35.774
[♪♪♪]

09:42.149 --> 09:43.481
Thank you.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.183
You're welcome.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.921
They have an amazing section
of wedding magazines and books

09:49.957 --> 09:51.890
in here
I'm gonna show you.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.359
Oh, my gosh.
Is that Johnny Blake?

09:54.394 --> 09:56.328
He's here?

09:56.363 --> 09:58.229
[Maddie]:
That's definitely him.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.332
Oh, my goodness.
He's so gorgeous.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.334
Wonder what
he's doing in Fool's Gold.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.402
His sister's
getting married.

10:04.438 --> 10:05.637
Johnny!

10:05.672 --> 10:07.138
Hey!

10:07.174 --> 10:08.306
Hey!

10:08.375 --> 10:11.042
Oh! I can't believe
you're here.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.577
Yeah! I, uh, came down early.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.678
Why?

10:13.714 --> 10:16.047
To help with
the wedding, of course.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.694
Well, then there's someone
you need to meet.

10:17.718 --> 10:21.086
This is my wedding planner,
Maddie Krug.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.088
Hey. Johnny Blake.
Nice to meet you.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.557
Ginger didn't tell me
she had a brother.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.959
Or that her brother
was you.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.594
You're you.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.096
Well, I am me.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.898
I think. Yep. Ha.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.367
Definitely me.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.135
I probably should've
mentioned this earlier.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.303
That would've been great.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.538
Johnny came early
to help with the wedding.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.307
Isn't that sweet?

10:42.342 --> 10:45.410
But I still feel weird about
you paying for all of it.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.778
You are out of your mind

10:46.813 --> 10:49.581
if you think I'm gonna let you
spend a dime, Ginge.

10:49.616 --> 10:50.849
Sky's the limit. Tch.

10:50.884 --> 10:55.453
Okay. Sky is the limit.
Got it.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.155
[Maddie chuckles awkwardly]

10:57.190 --> 10:58.630
- [cell buzzing]
- Oh, uh, excuse me.

10:59.960 --> 11:03.762
It's just my business partner.
I'll be one minute.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.597
[beeps phone on]

11:05.632 --> 11:06.798
Hello?

11:06.867 --> 11:08.500
<i>Hey, can you stop</i>

11:08.535 --> 11:09.912
at the office supply store
on the way back?

11:09.936 --> 11:11.514
<i>Yeah, but I don't know
how long I'm gonna be,</i>

11:11.538 --> 11:12.837
<i>because
I'm having coffee</i>

11:12.873 --> 11:14.973
with Ginger
and her brother... Johnny Blake.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.374
<i>[Isabel laughs]</i>

11:16.443 --> 11:17.642
<i>Johnny Blake?</i>

11:17.678 --> 11:20.845
Yeah, well I am having tea
with George Clooney.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.247
<i>Anyways, we need
printer paper.</i>

11:22.282 --> 11:24.215
- No, no, Isabel, I'm serious.
<i>- Bye!</i>

11:24.251 --> 11:26.251
[beep]

11:26.286 --> 11:28.420
[exhales deeply]

11:33.226 --> 11:35.460
Hi. Ahem.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.529
So. Where were we?

11:37.597 --> 11:40.665
That's right.
You were being you.

11:40.734 --> 11:41.900
[chuckles feebly]

11:41.935 --> 11:42.967
So...

11:43.036 --> 11:44.369
Ginger just told me

11:44.404 --> 11:45.982
that you own
the local wedding dress shop,

11:46.006 --> 11:48.173
but you've never actually
planned an entire wedding?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.542
Yeah.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.577
Is that something you think
you can handle, Maggie?

11:54.414 --> 11:55.613
It's Maddie.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.649
And, um, yeah, I do.

11:57.684 --> 12:00.618
Johnny, she knows everything
about weddings.

12:00.654 --> 12:02.020
She also knows
my name will

12:02.055 --> 12:03.066
bring her tons
of free publicity

12:03.090 --> 12:04.389
to her store.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.657
Actually, I agreed

12:05.692 --> 12:08.059
to do this wedding
before I knew who you were.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.895
It's true, Johnny.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.630
[sighs] I'm sorry.
It's just...

12:12.666 --> 12:15.900
you know, usually,
people want something from me.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.436
Well, I don't.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.017
So, back
to my wedding planning.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.707
Ginger, I'm not sure

12:22.743 --> 12:24.343
I'm really the right
person for this job.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.877
You are.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.245
She is!

12:28.348 --> 12:29.447
Please do it.

12:30.684 --> 12:32.150
Look, if you're
who Ginger wants,

12:32.185 --> 12:33.518
then, uh...

12:33.587 --> 12:34.827
I'm not gonna
stand in your way.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.625
All right.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.026
Then there are

12:42.062 --> 12:44.006
some wedding magazines over here
we should look at...

12:44.030 --> 12:45.196
"Jimmy."

12:45.232 --> 12:46.564
It's Johnny.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.166
Hah.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.668
I see what you did there.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.406
[♪♪♪]

13:00.247 --> 13:01.412
You realize

13:01.481 --> 13:03.681
you're acting like
you robbed a bank, right?

13:03.717 --> 13:05.717
Uh... ahem.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.685
Force of habit.

13:07.721 --> 13:10.021
He doesn't get
a lot of privacy in L.A.

13:10.090 --> 13:13.158
Look, Johnny, no one in
this town is gonna bother you.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.259
It's a safe space.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.628
Hello, Maddie, honey.

13:16.696 --> 13:19.063
Doing a little
Christmas shopping?

13:19.099 --> 13:20.899
Actually, no, Gladys,
I am planning a wedding.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.300
Oh! Finally.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.003
[Maddie]:
Ahem. No. Not mine.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.105
This is my client,
Ginger,

13:27.140 --> 13:28.773
and her brother,
Johnny.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.009
Oh, I know who he is!

13:31.077 --> 13:32.477
Can I get a selfie?

13:32.546 --> 13:35.280
I don't think Johnny wants
to take pictures right now.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.425
Oh, you know what?
That's okay.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.082
Come on. Come on!

13:38.151 --> 13:40.251
Come on in here,
Gladys.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.886
- Thank you!
- Oh, ho, ho. Wow!

13:41.955 --> 13:43.354
- Ready?
- That's quite a camera.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.989
[pop!]

13:45.025 --> 13:46.491
[camera whirs]

13:46.526 --> 13:48.059
And quite
the flash, too!

13:48.094 --> 13:50.395
Cool! I can't wait
to post this.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.629
Uh, let's
respect his privacy

13:51.698 --> 13:53.464
and not post
anything online.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.699
I meant
on my refrigerator.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.034
"Online." [scoffs]

13:56.069 --> 13:58.169
What do I look like,
a hipster? [Chuckles]

13:58.205 --> 13:59.838
[laughing]

14:00.974 --> 14:02.507
So why don't you take
a look at these,

14:02.542 --> 14:04.676
and tell me
what you like?

14:04.711 --> 14:06.144
I don't need
a magazine.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.245
I got an idea up here.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.080
Oh! Great, okay.
Let's hear it.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.028
[thick Scottish brogue]:
"Christmas in Scotland."

14:12.052 --> 14:14.986
Huh? Everything is
red, green, and white plaid.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.723
What? Come on,
you love Scotland.

14:18.792 --> 14:21.192
I also love pugs,

14:21.228 --> 14:23.328
but I don't want that to be
the theme of my wedding.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.796
[Maddie]: Uh...

14:24.831 --> 14:26.764
How about this?

14:26.800 --> 14:29.434
I'm thinking
muted wintry tones,

14:29.469 --> 14:31.402
something that evokes
a fresh snowfall,

14:31.438 --> 14:32.438
that symbolizes

14:32.505 --> 14:34.038
a new start,
a new beginning

14:34.074 --> 14:35.807
with your life
with Oliver.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.809
I love that.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.545
So, I guess this means
no bagpipes either?

14:40.614 --> 14:42.814
He is joking, right?

14:42.849 --> 14:44.415
Sadly, he is not.

14:44.451 --> 14:45.383
I was also thinking
that maybe

14:45.418 --> 14:46.885
you could pull up
to the ceremony

14:46.920 --> 14:48.620
in a sleigh.
Can you get a reindeer?

14:48.688 --> 14:50.099
If you can't,
I can call my animal guy

14:50.123 --> 14:51.022
and fly one in.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.590
Johnny...

14:52.659 --> 14:55.193
this doesn't need
to be a Hollywood production.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.194
I know.
I know, I know.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.362
I'm sorry.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.863
I'm just really
excited for you.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.431
Since Mom and Dad
aren't here,

15:00.467 --> 15:02.567
I kinda feel like
I'm doing it for them, too.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.036
I know.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.304
I love you.

15:07.474 --> 15:08.773
Love you too, Ginge.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.013
[♪♪♪]

15:29.429 --> 15:31.162
[knocking]

15:31.197 --> 15:32.330
Maddie!

15:32.365 --> 15:34.933
I thought you were
coming back to the store.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.367
I am dying!

15:36.436 --> 15:37.969
I cannot believe
you are planning

15:38.004 --> 15:40.305
Johnny Blake's
sister's wedding!

15:40.340 --> 15:42.240
This is huge for us!

15:42.275 --> 15:44.876
We are going to be
in every wedding magazine

15:44.911 --> 15:46.778
and website in the country.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.846
Wow! You did it.

15:48.882 --> 15:51.015
Except...

15:52.118 --> 15:53.685
Except...?

15:53.720 --> 15:54.786
I may have told him

15:54.821 --> 15:56.341
we wouldn't use his name
for publicity.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.423
Uh...

15:58.458 --> 16:00.959
Why would you do that?

16:00.994 --> 16:03.061
Well, I didn't want him
to think we were using him.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.062
We are using him!

16:04.097 --> 16:05.430
That's how it works.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.265
Look, I'm sorry,

16:07.334 --> 16:09.233
but you can't tell anyone
about this right now.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.202
But hey! I am going
to be bringing in

16:11.237 --> 16:13.171
extra money
at the end of the quarter.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.673
How much money?

16:15.742 --> 16:17.408
I haven't exactly
settled on a price.

16:17.444 --> 16:18.376
Maddie...

16:18.411 --> 16:19.444
Well, I wanted
to see

16:19.479 --> 16:22.046
how much wedding planners
make first.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.382
Well, it depends on
how much the client has...

16:24.417 --> 16:25.583
He has a lot.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.352
I'll take care of it.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.720
Don't worry.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.288
Thank you.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.397
[Maddie]: So, that's a "no"
to the manly man-lodge venue?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.566
Unless my gown
is made of flannel.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.234
And a "no"
to the art gallery?

16:43.269 --> 16:44.335
It's too, uh...

16:44.371 --> 16:45.514
What's the word
I'm looking for?

16:45.538 --> 16:46.404
Artsy?

16:46.473 --> 16:47.638
Yes. That.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.040
Okay.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.109
Couldn't we just set up
one of those tents outside?

16:52.178 --> 16:54.012
In every wedding movie,

16:54.080 --> 16:55.360
what happens
when there's a tent?

16:56.316 --> 16:57.915
It rains?

16:57.951 --> 16:59.083
And then?

16:59.119 --> 17:00.084
Splash!

17:00.120 --> 17:01.886
I don't want a tent.

17:01.921 --> 17:04.021
Yeah, me neither.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.522
Whose terrible idea
was that, anyway?

17:05.558 --> 17:06.523
[all chuckling]

17:06.559 --> 17:07.892
I'm out of cider.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.127
Ginge, you want
a refill?

17:09.162 --> 17:10.994
- I'll go with you.
- All right.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.165
[♪♪♪]

17:18.104 --> 17:19.837
Look, I'm sorry
about yesterday.

17:19.873 --> 17:23.174
I know I was being
a little rude.

17:24.344 --> 17:25.510
More than a little.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.711
You got to understand,

17:26.780 --> 17:28.913
Ginger's the only family
I have.

17:30.116 --> 17:31.516
I just want what's best for her.

17:34.587 --> 17:37.221
Ginger will have
the wedding of her dreams.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.490
I promise you.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.492
And don't worry
about the venue.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.605
We are just getting started.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.195
When you get back to L.A.,

17:44.230 --> 17:45.608
we will video call you
from every location.

17:45.632 --> 17:46.697
Ginger didn't tell you?

17:46.766 --> 17:49.100
I'm not leaving
until after the wedding.

17:49.135 --> 17:50.234
I figured a little,

17:50.270 --> 17:52.270
you know, change of pace
might do me good.

17:52.305 --> 17:55.606
Well, doesn't get much more
slow-paced than here.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.775
[♪♪♪]

17:57.844 --> 17:59.155
[Maddie]:
It must be really weird,

17:59.179 --> 18:01.179
having people stare at you
all the time.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.681
[Johnny]: Ah, sometimes,
it's a little much.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.194
[Maddie]: I guess
it's kind of what you signed up

18:05.218 --> 18:06.617
for though, right?

18:06.653 --> 18:08.586
Yeah, I never really
thought it'd be like this.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.555
Well, you know,
like they say...

18:10.590 --> 18:12.623
Life is
what you make it. Oh!

18:14.194 --> 18:16.394
[♪♪♪]

18:24.604 --> 18:26.504
Okay, your turn.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.306
For what?

18:28.341 --> 18:30.575
Oh, it's a town tradition,

18:30.610 --> 18:33.578
and all the money benefits
Make-a-Wish Foundation.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.513
Well, I would,
but I don't have any cash on me.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.648
Does the gazebo
take credit cards?

18:37.684 --> 18:39.650
I'll put it on your tab.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.719
Oh, you know, we should
probably talk about that.

18:41.788 --> 18:42.687
Your fee.

18:42.755 --> 18:43.955
Right. Of course.

18:43.990 --> 18:47.325
I made a list of what
wedding planners make.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.926
Priced low to high.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.796
I figured somewhere
in the middle would be fair.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.398
That doesn't seem like enough.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.334
No, it's okay.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.035
Are you sure?
I can pay you more.

18:58.071 --> 18:59.648
Oh, yeah. I'm making a profit.
It's fine.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.639
You are literally
the worst negotiator

19:01.674 --> 19:03.141
I've ever met
in my entire life.

19:03.176 --> 19:06.144
I know. I think I paid
twice as much for my first car

19:06.212 --> 19:07.245
as it was worth.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.779
[laughs]

19:08.815 --> 19:09.914
So... deal?

19:09.949 --> 19:11.782
Deal.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.786
Uh...

19:15.822 --> 19:17.021
Your turn.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.924
Okay.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.761
[♪♪♪]

19:35.208 --> 19:38.543
Did you wish for
an Academy Award?

19:38.611 --> 19:40.444
[laughs] What
makes you say that?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.246
Isn't that what
all actors wish for?

19:43.449 --> 19:45.917
What'd you wish for?

19:47.420 --> 19:49.253
Uh, if I tell you,
it won't come true.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.322
[phone buzzing]

19:51.357 --> 19:52.357
Excuse me.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.428
Uh, looks like
Ginger's got to do

19:57.463 --> 19:59.330
some troubleshooting
for Mayor Marsha.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.065
She wants to know
if we can meet up later.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.366
Oh, yeah.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.969
I should probably get
back to my store, anyway.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.938
Well, my car's
parked out in front.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.039
I'll walk with you.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.074
Okay.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.346
[♪♪♪]

20:19.219 --> 20:20.918
[laughs] Okay.
I-I can't do this.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.587
You're, like, walking
in slow-motion.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.121
It's called
"strolling."

20:24.190 --> 20:25.623
Right, but I'd like

20:25.692 --> 20:26.835
to make it to the end
of the street

20:26.859 --> 20:29.026
before I hit
retirement age.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.930
Hey.

20:32.966 --> 20:35.299
Who's that?

20:35.335 --> 20:37.168
Oh, it's my
second-grade teacher.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.736
Wow, so you basically

20:38.771 --> 20:40.538
know every single person
in this town, huh?

20:40.573 --> 20:41.772
Yeah.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.774
In L.A., I don't even know
my next-door neighbor.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.176
- Really?
- Nope.

20:45.211 --> 20:48.479
[laughs] I was
engaged to mine.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.681
What happened?

20:50.717 --> 20:53.017
We had
different goals.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.453
Sorry.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.655
It was
a long time ago.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.227
Is there a gym nearby?

21:03.263 --> 21:04.562
I haven't worked out
in a while.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.163
Oh, no, we don't
have a gym here.

21:06.199 --> 21:08.165
How is that possible?

21:08.201 --> 21:09.634
You just hike
up the mountain,

21:09.669 --> 21:11.202
do pull-ups
on the tree branches,

21:11.271 --> 21:12.503
swim in the lake.

21:12.538 --> 21:13.604
Boom! There's your gym.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.972
Right.

21:15.008 --> 21:16.774
I'm kidding!

21:16.809 --> 21:18.242
The gym's down
the block.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.944
We're not cavemen.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.712
Okay, this is me.

21:21.748 --> 21:22.713
All right, well...

21:22.749 --> 21:24.181
Hi! I'm Isabel.

21:24.217 --> 21:25.383
I'm Maddie's
business partner.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.418
You must
be Johnny Blake!

21:26.452 --> 21:27.385
I mean,
what am I saying?

21:27.453 --> 21:28.464
Of course
you're Johnny Blake!

21:28.488 --> 21:29.320
Oh! Hey!

21:29.355 --> 21:30.755
You know,
I was thinking...

21:30.790 --> 21:31.756
maybe you would want
to take a photo

21:31.791 --> 21:32.923
for our wall of fame?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.325
We don't have
one of those.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.326
We can start one.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.427
Run.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.697
Uh, nice to meet you,
uh, Isabel.

21:39.732 --> 21:40.998
Yes! Yes.
Bye, Johnny Blake.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.773
Maddie!
You are a genius.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.808
I am?

21:49.842 --> 21:50.975
Yes! You start
dating him,

21:51.010 --> 21:52.643
and then the publicity
for the store

21:52.712 --> 21:53.712
happens naturally!

21:53.746 --> 21:54.779
You are
out of your mind.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.080
He's <i> Johnny Blake.</i>

21:56.115 --> 21:57.248
Hey! Hey.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.683
Give yourself
some credit.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.585
You are funny, and smart
and beautiful.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.554
Look, even if
he was a regular guy,

22:03.623 --> 22:04.655
I would not date him.

22:04.691 --> 22:05.890
He's outta here

22:05.958 --> 22:07.236
in, like, three weeks.
What would be the point?

22:07.260 --> 22:10.761
He's Johnny Blake!

22:10.797 --> 22:12.430
[♪♪♪]

22:16.169 --> 22:17.768
[to self]: No.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.611
You ready to try on
some dresses?

22:27.680 --> 22:30.147
Yes! I can't wait.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.617
[♪♪♪]

22:40.426 --> 22:42.893
It feels too... princess-y.

22:44.263 --> 22:46.430
Maybe I should just
wear a pantsuit.

22:48.568 --> 22:51.335
Ginger.
Do not stress.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.938
This is all
a part of the process.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.340
And now that I've seen
you in a few dresses,

22:56.409 --> 22:57.820
I have a better idea
of what you need.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.443
I'll call in
some favors

22:59.479 --> 23:00.756
and get new dresses
sent here A.S.A.P.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.547
Thanks, Maddie.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.216
I'm so happy
I walked in here.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.282
Oh! So you do
have cell service?

23:38.317 --> 23:41.085
Yeah, it's a little spotty.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.800
So did you read
the <i> Fire's Edge</i> script yet?

23:43.890 --> 23:45.689
I'm gonna have
to get back to you.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.691
I'm only
about halfway through.

23:47.727 --> 23:48.826
So what did you think about

23:48.861 --> 23:50.261
the Hawaii scene
at the beginning?

23:50.296 --> 23:51.495
<i>Loved it.</i>

23:51.531 --> 23:53.397
There is no Hawaii scene.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.476
<i>Then have the writer
put one in.</i>

23:54.500 --> 23:55.566
Johnny.

23:55.601 --> 23:56.967
I gotta go, Barb. Bye.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.025
Hey! Um...

24:21.060 --> 24:23.294
Sorry if there
was some confusion,

24:23.329 --> 24:24.940
but Ginger is not coming
for another hour.

24:24.964 --> 24:25.996
No, I came down early.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.097
I got gloves!

24:27.133 --> 24:29.533
[laughs] I'm happy for you.

24:29.602 --> 24:32.102
I forgot what it feels like
to actually be cold, you know?

24:32.138 --> 24:34.371
Kinda reminds me of
when I was a kid.

24:34.407 --> 24:35.272
Where did you grow up?

24:35.308 --> 24:36.407
Florida.

24:36.442 --> 24:38.576
Uh, oh. Brr-r-r?

24:38.611 --> 24:40.211
Well, every year,
my parents would rent

24:40.246 --> 24:42.024
a snow machine and build a hill
out in front of our house.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.215
Whole neighborhood
would show up.

24:44.283 --> 24:46.450
The snow would melt
in about an hour,

24:46.486 --> 24:49.653
but... best hour
of the whole year.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.589
That's really sweet, Johnny.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.057
[quietly]: Yeah.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.060
Uh, well, I'm really happy

24:56.095 --> 24:57.862
that Ginger
is getting married here.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.675
She will have a white Christmas
for her wedding.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.866
Eh. Even if it wasn't
already snowy,

25:01.901 --> 25:03.033
I'd hire a guy to make some.

25:04.437 --> 25:06.557
You have a "guy" for just
about everything, don't you?

25:07.306 --> 25:08.973
Ah, pretty much.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.775
Well, I'm going to go see
my "tree guy".

25:11.811 --> 25:14.044
Ooh! I want a tree guy!

25:14.080 --> 25:16.180
Come with.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.318
Thanks for helping me
take this home.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.965
Well, you know, you
could've had it delivered,

25:22.989 --> 25:24.154
like mine was.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.089
I would've paid for it.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.790
[laughs] Thank you,

25:26.826 --> 25:27.958
but dragging
a tree home

25:27.994 --> 25:29.226
is half the fun.

25:29.262 --> 25:30.794
Well, then I guess
it's a good thing

25:30.863 --> 25:33.564
I was here
to help you then, huh?

25:33.599 --> 25:34.932
Actually...

25:35.001 --> 25:36.166
Whoa.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

25:36.202 --> 25:37.835
I was just
humoring you.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.470

25:39.505 --> 25:41.205
Okay.

25:51.284 --> 25:52.383
Ha!

25:52.418 --> 25:53.551
Ahh.

25:53.586 --> 25:54.985
I always wanted to do that.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.489
Okay.

25:58.524 --> 26:00.257
Why don't I show you
how it's really done?

26:00.293 --> 26:01.492
Oh, yeah?

26:01.527 --> 26:02.826
Okay.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.762
You got to get some deep snow,
so it's warmer.

26:04.797 --> 26:08.766
Wanna get about
a half-a-cup in each hand...

26:08.801 --> 26:10.734
and gradually apply pressure

26:10.770 --> 26:13.003
until you start
to feel resistance.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.872
Then, you place it aside...

26:14.907 --> 26:16.774
give it a couple of minutes

26:16.809 --> 26:18.709
until it settles into
the right consistency...

26:21.514 --> 26:23.447
Johnny?

26:24.984 --> 26:26.917
Johnny?

26:31.023 --> 26:32.556

26:32.592 --> 26:35.059

Now you're toast.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.105
Oh!

26:48.174 --> 26:50.574
Okay! Okay! I surrender!
I surrender! I surrender!

Wow. This place really
doesn't mess around

when it comes to Christmas, huh?

28:22.501 --> 28:25.169
No, we don't.

Oh! Johnny...
these are my parents,

- Nice to meet you.

28:30.576 --> 28:32.976
Hi! You look really familiar.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.590
Did you used to work
at the Stop'n'Shop?

28:35.614 --> 28:38.382
Uh, Mom, Johnny
is an actor.

in anything I've seen?

that <i> Fire's Edge</i> one.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.896
Sorry, it was just
really loud.

28:52.932 --> 28:53.942
No need to apologize.
You know what?

28:53.966 --> 28:55.899
I totally agree.

28:55.935 --> 28:56.867
[Loretta and Johnny laughing]

28:56.902 --> 28:58.602
So...

28:58.671 --> 29:00.971
what brings you
to town, Johnny?

29:01.006 --> 29:03.841
Um, you didn't tell them?

29:03.876 --> 29:06.009
You told me to keep it quiet.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.312
I know, but...
people usually don't.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.914
Well, maybe you're hanging out
with the wrong people.

- Hey!

- [Mom]: Gee, you're pretty.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.991
Are you an actress, too?

29:21.026 --> 29:23.560
Oh, no, I do coding
and web design.

29:23.629 --> 29:25.462
I'm doing
the Fool's Gold website.

29:25.498 --> 29:28.165

I have no idea what coding is...

We're having
our annual dessert potluck.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.176
Um, Mom, I think that they have

30:12.211 --> 30:15.145
better things to do
than hang with the locals.

30:15.181 --> 30:18.182
No, I think the locals
are starting to grow on me.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.316

Well, then it's settled!

What are you showing him?

30:44.743 --> 30:46.376
Just all the photos

30:46.445 --> 30:48.478
Not the one
where I got nervous...

30:48.514 --> 30:49.646
Oh... yeah.

Mom, seriously?

30:51.083 --> 30:52.282
I'm sorry, honey.

30:52.318 --> 30:54.551

That was
very nice of you.

Best part of the job.

31:43.602 --> 31:44.835
I hope my Mom didn't

31:44.870 --> 31:46.570
ask you too many
personal questions.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.505
She doesn't really
understand boundaries.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.074
Yeah, are you sure she's not
a plant for the tabloids?

31:51.110 --> 31:52.442
Oh, yeah, she's
been lying in wait

31:52.478 --> 31:53.744
for, like, 30 years

31:53.779 --> 31:54.779
on the off-chance

31:54.847 --> 31:56.157
a celebrity would
come to her potluck.

31:56.181 --> 31:57.981
[chuckling]

You know, I'm kidding
about your mom, but...

people haven't always
turned out to be

32:01.553 --> 32:02.953
who I thought they were.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.556
Well...
that is a quality

32:06.592 --> 32:08.725
that is not exclusive
to celebrities.

32:09.895 --> 32:11.895
Johnny! Try this
fruitcake I made.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.497
Oh, I...

Trying to convince Gladys
you love her fruitcake.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.144
So you're basically
a local now.

Get some water.

[Loretta]: So did you
have a good time, Johnny?

32:36.388 --> 32:37.388
I did.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.823
You sound surprised.

He can get it tomorrow.

Are you okay?

Yeah.
It's just...

34:08.013 --> 34:10.514
I've never seen
snowflakes this big,

34:10.549 --> 34:11.715
where you can actually

34:11.784 --> 34:13.483
see the patterns
of the crystals.

It's just...

34:14.920 --> 34:17.587

you can pick formal invitations,

35:14.813 --> 35:16.446
but because the wedding
is so soon,

35:16.482 --> 35:18.059
I think you might also
have to do one online.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.550
Isn't doing it
online tacky?

a ninja studying over there.

have to study this hard.

to this hand-blown
glass ornament...

a wedding keepsake.

more like this.

my own invitations.

get some tuberose

39:43.648 --> 39:45.615
Isn't that Johnny?

39:45.650 --> 39:47.350
He's looking
a little lost.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.452
Is he looking for
Ginger and Oliver?

39:49.488 --> 39:50.787
I don't think so.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.889
They went into
San Francisco for the night.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.924
Well, if he's
all by himself,

39:54.960 --> 39:56.126
I'm gonna
invite him over.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.794
- Mom, I don't want him...
- Hey, Johnny!

39:57.829 --> 39:59.095
Johnny!
Come on over!

39:59.164 --> 40:00.263
Oh!

40:00.332 --> 40:02.399
Hey, guys.

40:02.467 --> 40:04.100
[Ed]: Hey, JB!
Want some hot cocoa?

40:04.136 --> 40:05.468
Oh, no, thanks,
Ed, I'm good.

40:05.504 --> 40:08.638
Since this is not official
wedding planner business,

40:08.673 --> 40:10.774
don't feel obliged
to hang out with us.

40:10.809 --> 40:11.809
Oh, I don't. Unless...

40:11.877 --> 40:12.954
Unless you don't want me to?

40:12.978 --> 40:14.277
No, I d...

40:14.346 --> 40:15.512
Um, it's fine.

40:15.547 --> 40:16.513
[Mayor Marsha]:
Hi, everyone!

40:16.548 --> 40:18.248
And welcome

40:18.316 --> 40:20.683
to the 67th Annual

40:20.719 --> 40:24.487
Fool's Gold
Christmas Tree Lighting.

40:24.523 --> 40:27.791
And what a gorgeous night it is
to light this beautiful tree!

40:27.826 --> 40:29.926
So are you ready?

40:29.961 --> 40:30.961
[crowd]: Yes!

40:31.029 --> 40:32.195
Here we go!

40:32.230 --> 40:33.763
Five!

40:33.799 --> 40:34.831
[crowd joining in]:
Four!

40:34.866 --> 40:35.899
Three!

40:35.934 --> 40:37.100
Two!

40:37.169 --> 40:38.668
One!

40:39.738 --> 40:42.372
[crowd cheers]

40:45.477 --> 40:47.877
[♪♪♪]

40:50.715 --> 40:51.915
[shutters snapping]

40:51.950 --> 40:53.917
Uh... I'm sorry.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.351
No photos tonight, please.

40:55.387 --> 40:56.519
Thanks.

40:58.723 --> 40:59.789
What?

40:59.825 --> 41:01.024
I'm really good
with fans.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.792
It's just sometimes
I'm not in the mood.

41:02.828 --> 41:05.161
Yeah, they're not
taking photos of you.

41:07.332 --> 41:10.066
[embarrassed huff]

41:10.101 --> 41:12.202
Think we can pretend
that that never happened?

41:12.237 --> 41:13.770
No. No, we can't.

41:13.839 --> 41:15.905
Mm. Didn't think so.

41:17.609 --> 41:20.009
[♪♪♪]

41:49.608 --> 41:51.374
Just admit it.

41:51.409 --> 41:53.543
Holding his hand
meant something.

41:53.578 --> 41:55.879
He was probably just excited
about the Christmas tree.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.347
You just want it
to mean something

41:57.382 --> 41:58.382
for publicity.

41:58.416 --> 41:59.516
You know I do.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.451
And you know
I told him we wouldn't.

42:01.486 --> 42:02.986
Maddie... [sighs]

42:03.054 --> 42:04.254
I still don't understand

42:04.289 --> 42:06.122
why Johnny's demands
are more important

42:06.191 --> 42:07.557
than our store.

42:07.592 --> 42:09.526
You don't need him
for the website.

42:09.561 --> 42:12.662
Yes, but do you know
what every website needs?

42:12.697 --> 42:13.897
Attention.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.331
I.e.,
Johnny Blake.

42:15.367 --> 42:16.699
I can't do that to him.

42:17.836 --> 42:19.168
Even if you like him?

42:19.237 --> 42:20.670
Which we both know you do!

42:20.739 --> 42:23.907
Even if I did like him,
which I don't...

42:23.942 --> 42:26.609
I have no intention
of being with someone

42:26.678 --> 42:28.211
who isn't
gonna be here.

42:28.246 --> 42:29.246
[door bell jingles]

42:32.217 --> 42:33.349
Hey.

42:33.385 --> 42:34.784
Hi. Ahem.

42:34.819 --> 42:36.352
[Ginger]: Hey.

42:36.421 --> 42:37.421
Good morning.

42:37.455 --> 42:38.955
Morning.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.256
We should get going,

42:40.292 --> 42:41.335
if we're gonna make it
to the caterer's on time.

42:41.359 --> 42:42.692
[Johnny]:
Ugh, more food?

42:42.727 --> 42:45.361
I'm still in a carb coma
from your parents' party.

42:45.397 --> 42:46.741
That's okay.
You don't have to come.

42:46.765 --> 42:49.566
Thought we had this same
conversation last night.

42:49.634 --> 42:51.034
It seemed to work out
pretty well.

42:51.069 --> 42:53.436
Look, Johnny,

42:53.471 --> 42:57.106
you just do whatever
you have to do,

42:57.142 --> 42:59.709
and that's why I'm here,
so you don't have to be.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.444
Ugh. Can you believe this?

43:01.513 --> 43:03.012
So many people logged on

43:03.048 --> 43:04.581
to replay
the Christmas tree lighting,

43:04.649 --> 43:06.349
that the website crashed.

43:06.384 --> 43:07.517
You know what?

43:07.552 --> 43:08.863
Just narrow the food down
to the best stuff

43:08.887 --> 43:09.852
and I'll pick from that.

43:09.888 --> 43:10.888
I gotta go.

43:11.990 --> 43:14.324
[♪♪♪]

43:16.394 --> 43:17.894
Looks like
it's just you and me, then.

43:19.364 --> 43:21.397
Should we, um...

43:21.433 --> 43:22.699
[shutter snaps]

43:22.734 --> 43:23.833
Should we go?

43:23.868 --> 43:25.335
I'm just gonna
get my coat.

43:25.370 --> 43:27.570
[♪♪♪]

43:32.611 --> 43:34.444
You're awfully
quiet today.

43:34.479 --> 43:36.980
Is something wrong?

43:37.048 --> 43:40.049
Is this about what happened
between us last night?

43:41.586 --> 43:43.553
What happened last night?

43:44.956 --> 43:47.290
When I was holding your hand,
we almost kissed.

43:48.493 --> 43:51.260
Oh. Right. That.

43:52.664 --> 43:55.098
I just figured we got caught up
in the romance of it all.

43:55.133 --> 43:59.202
That happens here
at Christmas all the time

43:59.237 --> 44:01.738
I just don't want <i> you</i> to think

44:01.806 --> 44:03.673
that I thought
it meant anything.

44:05.010 --> 44:07.143
Oh. Good. That's...

44:07.178 --> 44:08.277
That's a relief.

44:08.313 --> 44:09.924
Because, then, how
could that work, right?

44:09.948 --> 44:11.581
My life is so insane,

44:11.616 --> 44:14.417
I'm never... rarely in
one place for very long.

44:14.452 --> 44:17.253
I'm practically like a nomad.

44:17.288 --> 44:20.223
And I love my life here.

44:20.258 --> 44:22.492
And a slow,

44:22.527 --> 44:24.560
quiet life
is not for everyone.

44:28.667 --> 44:30.066
Well...

44:30.101 --> 44:32.635
at least
we cleared the air, right?

44:34.105 --> 44:36.072
Yeah.

44:36.107 --> 44:37.874
Clear mountain air.

44:43.114 --> 44:45.415
Let's try
these wedding appetizers.

44:45.450 --> 44:47.984
Yeah. Ahem.

44:49.888 --> 44:51.721
Mm.

44:57.729 --> 45:00.029

45:00.065 --> 45:02.265
- Merry Christmas, Maddie!
- Hi, Maddie!

45:02.300 --> 45:04.267
Hi.

45:07.005 --> 45:09.405
[♪♪♪]

45:21.152 --> 45:23.986
So, where's Johnny?

45:24.022 --> 45:25.655
I thought he was
coming by today.

45:25.724 --> 45:27.290
Yeah, I didn't
want to bug him

45:27.325 --> 45:29.892
about the cake stuff
until we'd narrowed it down.

45:29.928 --> 45:33.529
So you're not just
trying to avoid him?

45:33.565 --> 45:35.965
[scoffs] No.
Why would I do that?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
You tell me.

45:38.036 --> 45:40.269
We should talk about
the groom's cake.

45:40.305 --> 45:41.604
Oliver, why don't
you tell Maddie

45:41.639 --> 45:43.473
what you had in mind
for the cake?

45:43.508 --> 45:45.274
A cake shaped
like a heart.

45:46.611 --> 45:47.977
That's actually really sweet.

45:48.046 --> 45:51.347
A biologically-accurate
human heart.

45:51.382 --> 45:53.382
'Cause how awesome would
that be, cutting into it?

45:53.418 --> 45:54.183
That would be really awesome.

45:54.219 --> 45:55.318
Traitor.

45:55.353 --> 45:57.653
We'll talk later.

Hey.

46:37.195 --> 46:38.661
Hi.

46:38.730 --> 46:40.263
Been a few days.

46:40.298 --> 46:42.231
Yeah.

46:42.267 --> 46:44.700
So, um, what have
you been up to?

46:44.736 --> 46:47.370
Still planning
Ginger's wedding.

46:47.405 --> 46:49.972
Right. That.

46:50.008 --> 46:52.008
You?

46:52.043 --> 46:55.111
You know, just, uh,
puttering around the house.

46:56.181 --> 46:58.114
"Puttering"...

46:58.149 --> 47:01.117
that sounds like one step closer
to "strolling."

47:01.152 --> 47:02.718
[both laughing]

47:02.754 --> 47:05.188
Be careful.
You might actually slow down.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.294
Ahem.

47:11.329 --> 47:13.763
Okay, I'm gonna
get back to shopping.

47:13.798 --> 47:15.298
Yeah. Yeah.
Me too.

47:15.333 --> 47:16.499
I can't seem to find

47:16.568 --> 47:18.434
the right Christmas gift
for Ginger.

47:18.469 --> 47:20.870
Well, what do you have so far?

47:20.905 --> 47:25.741
It's a "Fool's Gold Christmas"
key fob.

47:27.545 --> 47:29.312
Wow. That's...

47:29.347 --> 47:30.379
...The lamest gift ever?

47:30.448 --> 47:31.848
- Yeah.
- I know. I know.

47:31.883 --> 47:34.417
I usually have my assistant
do the gift-buying for me,

47:34.452 --> 47:35.651
but, this...

47:35.720 --> 47:39.188
I wanted to do it
myself for once.

47:41.693 --> 47:42.825
Come with me.

47:42.861 --> 47:43.759
Come on.

47:43.828 --> 47:45.194
'Kay.

47:47.332 --> 47:50.433
I just saw something
I think would be great.

47:53.838 --> 47:55.137
This is it.

47:55.173 --> 47:58.474
It's a pine tree.

47:58.543 --> 48:00.376
Wow.

48:02.146 --> 48:03.646
"The pine tree represents

48:03.681 --> 48:05.514
"a family's strength
and resiliency,

"and reminds us,

"that even when conditions
change around us,

we have strong roots."

It's perfect.

Thank you.

Nothing. Just...

like Santa to bring you
for Christmas, Brody?

I want my daddy
to come back.

Where is he?

He's in heaven.

You must miss him
very, very much.

Do you talk to him every night,
before you go to sleep?

50:00.064 --> 50:02.365
Never stop
doing that, okay?

50:02.400 --> 50:04.300
Because
he can hear you.

As long as you keep
talking to him,

This isn't exactly
what I was looking for.

It's kind of
the opposite, actually.

Yeah, yeah,
I'm so sorry, Ginger.

the dress I ordered.

50:59.791 --> 51:02.625
I don't know what happened.

51:02.660 --> 51:03.959
I know this dress.

51:03.995 --> 51:06.462
It's designer.
It's, like, $10,000.

51:06.497 --> 51:08.564
[door bell dings]

51:08.599 --> 51:09.599
[in unison]: Johnny.

51:09.634 --> 51:11.267
Oh, good!

51:11.302 --> 51:12.601
It came.

51:12.670 --> 51:16.305
Johnny. Um...
you had this sent?

51:16.340 --> 51:18.174
I called my stylist in L.A.

51:18.209 --> 51:19.319
the day
you couldn't find a dress,

51:19.343 --> 51:22.044
and this is the one
everyone wants.

51:23.581 --> 51:25.114
I'll go try it on.

51:25.149 --> 51:26.582
Are you sure?

51:26.617 --> 51:28.984
It's okay.

51:34.992 --> 51:37.193
[Ginger]: Okay! Here I come.

51:37.228 --> 51:39.361
Can't wait
to see it.

51:43.601 --> 51:46.769
Uh, Ginger,
that dress is-is...

51:46.804 --> 51:48.070
[awkward chuckle]

51:48.106 --> 51:49.605
It's awful.

51:50.675 --> 51:52.541
I'm so sorry.

51:52.577 --> 51:53.676
Thank goodness.

51:53.711 --> 51:54.711
What a relief.

51:55.980 --> 51:58.481
Is this the box
that you were looking for?

51:58.516 --> 51:59.682
It was under a desk.

51:59.750 --> 52:00.649
The cleaners must have moved it.

52:00.685 --> 52:02.351
Oh, yes, it is!

52:02.420 --> 52:03.886
I'm gonna go
take this off.

52:03.921 --> 52:05.921
I think that's a good idea.

52:05.957 --> 52:07.590
[chuckling]

52:07.625 --> 52:09.058
Okay, let's do this.

52:09.093 --> 52:10.593
All right.

52:12.263 --> 52:14.897
[♪♪♪]

52:23.241 --> 52:24.974
This is it.

52:25.042 --> 52:26.709
[sniffling]

52:26.744 --> 52:28.711
[whispers]: Those are
happy tears, right?

52:28.746 --> 52:30.746
Absolutely.

52:33.718 --> 52:35.851
[exhales deeply]

52:35.887 --> 52:37.786
Thank you, Maddie.

52:39.157 --> 52:41.423
[♪♪♪]

52:44.028 --> 52:45.461
Does anyone want
to go to Jo's

52:45.530 --> 52:48.063
and celebrate?

52:48.099 --> 52:49.243
They have a Christmas
"Candy Cane martini"

52:49.267 --> 52:51.133
I have been
dying to try.

52:51.169 --> 52:53.169
Say 8:00?

52:53.204 --> 52:55.437
I'm in.

52:56.574 --> 52:57.940
I would totally go,

52:57.975 --> 52:59.608
but, um, I have plans

52:59.644 --> 53:01.710
to go to the Italian restaurant
with Oliver.

53:01.746 --> 53:05.581
And I am watching
Christmas movies all night, so.

53:11.122 --> 53:13.522
I guess I'll see you
there at 8:00.

53:13.591 --> 53:16.392
Or I could stop by your place
and we could walk there.

53:16.427 --> 53:18.160
I don't think
that's a really good idea,

53:18.229 --> 53:20.196
you know, 'cause we said

53:20.231 --> 53:21.542
that we wouldn't
go on a date, remember?

53:21.566 --> 53:24.433
I remember. So it's not a date.
It's an "outing."

53:26.070 --> 53:28.037
It's just two people
walking together

53:28.072 --> 53:30.339
to a place where
they will proceed to hang out.

53:30.374 --> 53:32.374
Together.

53:35.146 --> 53:36.278
An outing?

53:36.314 --> 53:37.813
An outing.

53:37.882 --> 53:40.282
Okay, that's...
I like that.

53:42.587 --> 53:44.853
[♪♪♪]

53:44.889 --> 53:46.322
Later.

53:46.357 --> 53:47.489
Green?

53:47.525 --> 53:48.624
Or red?

53:48.659 --> 53:50.292
Hmm... mm.

53:50.328 --> 53:52.127
No. That one.

53:52.163 --> 53:53.662
So tell me again...

53:53.731 --> 53:55.931
How this not a date?

53:55.967 --> 53:58.300
We are not talking
about this again.

53:58.369 --> 54:00.314
Yeah, sure, we won't talk about
the fact that you're passing up

54:00.338 --> 54:02.271
a golden
opportunity for P.R.

54:02.340 --> 54:04.006
Seriously.

54:04.041 --> 54:06.508
Honey, I'm also saying this
as your best friend.

54:06.544 --> 54:08.811
If you really like him,

54:08.846 --> 54:10.779
what's the harm
in seeing where it goes?

54:10.815 --> 54:12.448
I have to protect myself,
Isabel.

54:12.483 --> 54:14.483
Even if I do have
feelings for him,

54:14.552 --> 54:16.585
this is all it can be
right now.

54:16.621 --> 54:18.220
Unless you let him in.

54:18.256 --> 54:21.423
Don't you have some Christmas
movie marathon to watch?

54:21.492 --> 54:23.459
Fine. I'll leave.

54:23.494 --> 54:25.060
Have fun
on your date.

54:25.129 --> 54:26.495
It's an outing!

54:26.530 --> 54:28.964
Whatever.

54:30.801 --> 54:33.802
[♪♪♪]

54:42.913 --> 54:44.880
[knocking]

54:50.821 --> 54:53.022
Wow.

54:53.057 --> 54:55.724
[chuckles] You clean up
pretty well yourself.

54:55.760 --> 54:57.559
Thank you.

55:07.772 --> 55:09.672
After you.

55:12.777 --> 55:15.044
[both laughing]

55:15.079 --> 55:16.556
There's door-to-door
caroling tonight.

55:16.580 --> 55:17.746
Do you want to go?

55:17.815 --> 55:19.026
Oh, ho. No one wants
to hear me sing.

55:19.050 --> 55:20.182
Trust me.

55:20.217 --> 55:21.717
I would ruin Christmas.

55:22.853 --> 55:25.020
Huh. Mistletoe.

55:27.491 --> 55:30.693
What do friends do
when they stand under mistletoe?

55:30.728 --> 55:32.394
I believe,
traditionally,

55:32.430 --> 55:33.762
it's a...

55:33.831 --> 55:35.731
it's a high-five.

55:35.766 --> 55:38.033
[laughs]

55:38.069 --> 55:39.501
Okay.

55:50.147 --> 55:52.047
[clink]

55:55.986 --> 55:57.619
What?

55:58.889 --> 56:01.590
There is no manly way
to drink this.

56:03.027 --> 56:05.394
Well, it's either this
or...

56:05.429 --> 56:06.429
"Santa's
Little Helper."

56:08.065 --> 56:10.099
"Candy Cane Martini" it is.

56:10.134 --> 56:11.667
Good choice.

56:11.702 --> 56:13.602
[cell ringing]

56:17.041 --> 56:18.240
[groans] Oh.

56:18.275 --> 56:20.442
I'm sorry.
I got to take this.

56:20.511 --> 56:22.044
- No problem.
- I'll be right back.

56:31.922 --> 56:33.088
Hi!

56:35.092 --> 56:38.060
Wow! You...
You look great.

56:38.095 --> 56:39.728
You...

56:39.764 --> 56:41.663
look like you went
back to college.

56:41.699 --> 56:44.032
Oh, yeah, all
the Silicon Valley guys

56:44.068 --> 56:45.234
dress like this.

56:45.302 --> 56:46.847
The sloppier you look,
the more money you have.

56:46.871 --> 56:47.836
So you're rich?

Uh, Marigold,
this is Maddie,

56:53.778 --> 56:55.778

I told you about.

56:55.813 --> 56:57.079
Of course.
Nice to meet you.

56:57.114 --> 56:58.247
I guess it must
be a shock

56:58.282 --> 57:00.048
to see Ted again
after all these years.

57:01.218 --> 57:02.484
No. Not really.

57:06.290 --> 57:08.023
Give it up, Mare.
He's not here.

57:09.126 --> 57:10.159
Who are you looking for?

57:10.227 --> 57:11.560
[chuckles]
Johnny Blake.

57:11.595 --> 57:13.729
Ted's parents said
he was in town.

57:13.764 --> 57:14.764
Have you seen him?

57:14.799 --> 57:16.865
We've crossed paths.

57:16.901 --> 57:18.534
I bet all
you local girls

57:18.569 --> 57:19.968
just freak out
when he walks by.

57:21.205 --> 57:23.672
We really do.
Just a lot of screaming.

57:23.707 --> 57:25.474
[chuckles]

57:27.845 --> 57:29.978
Sorry about that.

Um, hi.

I'm Johnny Blake.

[Ted]: Sorry.
This is Marigold.

Hi-lo.

57:47.898 --> 57:50.732
So... Johnny.

57:50.768 --> 57:51.967
What brings you to town?

57:52.036 --> 57:54.436
I just came up to help
plan my sister's wedding.

57:54.505 --> 57:55.938
Ah. Bet you can't wait

57:56.006 --> 57:57.286
to get back
to civilization, huh?

Better go.

Who told you that?

58:28.539 --> 58:30.072
I never said that.

58:30.107 --> 58:31.773
I saw him in
one of the photo albums

58:31.842 --> 58:32.875
at your mom's house.

58:32.910 --> 58:34.877
She may have
mentioned it.

58:34.912 --> 58:36.745
And called him a name
that I can't repeat,

58:36.814 --> 58:39.548
but, uh, fully agree with.

I appreciate
your concern...

58:44.221 --> 58:45.621
but I'm fine now.

58:45.656 --> 58:46.656
Really.

I don't think I can
do the friend thing, Maddie.

59:05.709 --> 59:07.743
I don't want to.

59:07.778 --> 59:09.545
I don't think
we can be anything more.

59:09.580 --> 59:11.179
Look, seeing Ted

59:11.215 --> 59:12.648
is a great reminder

59:12.683 --> 59:14.283
of what happens
when peoples' lives

59:14.318 --> 59:16.451
are on different paths.

59:16.487 --> 59:17.664
Maddie, you're
over-thinking it.

They're actually
turning out great.

59:49.920 --> 59:52.688
So... are you
not telling me

59:52.723 --> 59:54.156
about your date
with Johnny

59:54.191 --> 59:56.091
because I'm his sister
and it's weird?

59:56.126 --> 59:57.826
Because,
as your friend,

59:57.895 --> 59:59.595
I just want to know
if you had fun.

59:59.630 --> 01:00:01.129
And if you like him.

01:00:01.198 --> 01:00:02.198
And if you kissed.

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:04.366
Okay, that is weird.

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:05.567
Ginge,

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:07.736
it was not a date,

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:10.606
and nothing happened

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:12.808
except me realizing
that nothing can happen.

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:15.944
I'm sorry.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.190
I know that's not
what you wanted to hear.

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:18.313
But you two are so...

01:00:18.382 --> 01:00:19.414
Ginge, stop.

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:21.350
Fine.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.219
Maddie...

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:27.222
when this wedding
is over,

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:28.571
we'll still keep
in touch, right?

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:30.392
No matter what?

01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:32.194
Of course we will.
No matter what.

01:00:32.262 --> 01:00:33.962

and get rid of me.

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:39.768
So I was wondering...

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.236
because
it's the holidays

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:43.872
and a lot of my friends
aren't able to make it,

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:47.009
will you be
my Maid of Honor?

01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:50.045
What?

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.448
Yeah!

01:00:53.484 --> 01:00:55.117
Yeah?

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:56.418
Yeah! Of course!

01:00:56.453 --> 01:00:57.886
Of course I will.

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.027
I didn't expect
to see you today.

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:29.351
Ginger said you were
handling the party favors,

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.753
so I came to drop off
the samples.

01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:33.255
Thanks.

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:39.594
This is really awkward.
I'm gonna go.

01:01:39.663 --> 01:01:41.530
Uh, wait.

01:01:41.565 --> 01:01:42.631
Want to come in
a minute?

01:01:42.666 --> 01:01:44.266
I just took some cookies
out of the oven.

01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:47.669
You bake?

01:01:47.738 --> 01:01:51.573
Well, if you call opening
a package of pre-made dough

01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:53.141
already cut into squares
"baking".

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.043
- No, I don't.
- Hey...

01:01:55.079 --> 01:01:57.212
A cookie comes out of my oven,
I'm a happy man.

01:01:57.247 --> 01:01:58.680
[laughs]

01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:01.149
Ahem. I actually have
a lot to do for the wedding,

01:02:01.185 --> 01:02:02.718
so I'm gonna go.

01:02:02.786 --> 01:02:04.119
How about this...

01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:05.353
Come in for
a couple minutes,

01:02:05.422 --> 01:02:06.621
have a cookie, I promise,

01:02:06.657 --> 01:02:08.123
we'll only talk
about the wedding.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.727
[♪♪♪]

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.966
Okay.

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:20.068
But the moment
you start being charming,

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:22.604
I'm leaving.

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:26.608
I mean,
that's always, right?

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:34.015
[Johnny]:
Help yourself.

01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:35.161
These actually
look pretty good.

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:36.384
Well, you know,

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.854
everything's better when
you're in good company.

01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:40.522
Okay, cut it out.

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:41.823
What?

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:43.859
I told you
not to be charming.

01:02:43.894 --> 01:02:45.293
I'm not.

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:48.096
"Everything's better
when you're in good company."

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:50.098
[laughs] I didn't
say it like that.

01:02:50.134 --> 01:02:51.177
You did! And you did
the little eyebrow thing!

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:52.400
What eyebrow thing?

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:54.102
You just did!

01:02:54.138 --> 01:02:55.437
I know your game.

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:57.839
I'm taking one of your cookies.

01:02:57.875 --> 01:02:59.508
Oh, my goodness.

01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:01.143
What?

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:02.277
This is sadder

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:03.423
than Charlie Brown's
Christmas tree!

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:04.980
At least
that had an ornament.

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:06.348
I know,
I bought a bunch,

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:08.984
I just, uh, didn't get around
to putting them up.

01:03:09.052 --> 01:03:09.951
Well, let's do it.

01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:11.253
Now?

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:12.621
Yes! Now.

01:03:12.689 --> 01:03:14.589
This is a Christmas emergency.

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:17.058
Ay-yi-yi.

01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:19.327
Um, okay.
Um, oh, all right.

01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:20.662
This is for you.

01:03:20.697 --> 01:03:21.596
Love it.

01:03:21.632 --> 01:03:23.131
Let's do this.

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:25.634
[♪♪♪]

01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:31.840
Voila!

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:35.243
[he chuckles]

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:36.845
Looking good.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.113
Yeah, I can't remember

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.648
the last time
I did this myself.

01:03:39.683 --> 01:03:40.782
I usually just...

01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:41.828
[overlapping]:
...Hire a guy.

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:43.485
[he chuckles]

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:47.289
I forgot how much
I love doing this.

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:49.457
Why'd you stop?

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:51.693
Well, when
my parents died,

01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:53.862
it was just...
it was too hard.

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:56.531
That was our favorite time
together as a family,

01:03:56.567 --> 01:03:59.701
and then it was...
it was just gone.

01:03:59.736 --> 01:04:02.103
Ginger mentioned
it was just the two of you,

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:04.906
but I didn't
want to pry.

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:06.575
Johnny,
I'm really sorry.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:08.610
Oh, it's okay.

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:12.113
No, they died just after
I graduated high school.

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:13.448
I was 18,
and all of a sudden,

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:14.727
I was responsible
for everything,

01:04:14.751 --> 01:04:18.019
including Ginger.

01:04:18.055 --> 01:04:20.155
That's why you connected
with that little boy

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.690
when you were Santa.

01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:24.292
I knew
just how he felt.

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:26.706
Ah, I really wish
they were here

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:28.363
to see Ginger
get married.

01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:30.298
They are.

01:04:31.435 --> 01:04:32.701
You really
believe that?

01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:35.971
Absolutely.

01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:39.474
I really didn't
care much about Christmas

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:40.842
after they died.

01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:43.478
At least, not until
Ginger decided to get married

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:45.113
on Christmas Eve.

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:47.549
I came up here...

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:50.418
now I care about
all sorts of things.

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:54.089
[♪♪♪]

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:09.404
[Ginger gasps]

01:05:09.439 --> 01:05:11.006
What's wrong?

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:12.707
Maddie is still at Johnny's!

01:05:12.743 --> 01:05:14.976
That's... terrible?

01:05:15.012 --> 01:05:16.311
No, it's awesome!

01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:17.479
I can't keep up.

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:21.983
Mm.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.953
You realize you just
ate my patient?

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.989
Sorry.

01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:31.393
[♪♪♪]

01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:39.267
This is what it's
all about, isn't it?

01:05:39.303 --> 01:05:41.236
Absolutely.

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:45.941
Did it get darker
earlier tonight?

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:49.377
Well, it is 8:00.

01:05:49.413 --> 01:05:52.147
What? Are you serious?

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:55.750
I'm supposed to be at
my parents' house right now.

01:05:55.786 --> 01:05:58.720
Are you sure you're not just
running away again?

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.089
I'm sure.

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:03.058
Okay.

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:05.527
There you go.

01:06:05.562 --> 01:06:07.495
Thank you.

01:06:11.535 --> 01:06:12.867
What are these?

01:06:12.936 --> 01:06:14.102
Uh, nothing.

01:06:15.272 --> 01:06:16.838
Did you draw those?

01:06:16.907 --> 01:06:18.873
I was just doodling.

01:06:18.909 --> 01:06:20.742
Johnny, those aren't
just doodles.

01:06:20.777 --> 01:06:21.910
You're an artist.

01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:24.245
I'm not.
I'm an actor.

01:06:24.281 --> 01:06:25.380
I just do this for fun,

01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:27.482
you know, between takes,
that sort of thing.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:31.319
What are you so afraid of?

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:33.788
Um...

01:06:33.824 --> 01:06:35.824
Same thing as you.

01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:38.093
Trusting someone.

You know...

01:06:42.432 --> 01:06:44.265
you can trust me.

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:48.203

the same thing.

Excuse me one sec.

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:24.372
So?

01:07:24.408 --> 01:07:25.940
So nothing.

01:07:25.976 --> 01:07:28.276
Today is about you.

01:07:28.311 --> 01:07:30.078
I don't get any details?

01:07:30.113 --> 01:07:31.113
Ginger.

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:32.313
Stop the interrogation.

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:35.418
I love this church.

01:07:36.953 --> 01:07:39.354
I still can't believe
they're letting us use it.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:41.856
They don't have any services
on Christmas Eve?

01:07:41.892 --> 01:07:44.392
No, there are too many people,
so we use the high school gym.

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:46.094
But we are lucky to get it,

01:07:46.129 --> 01:07:47.529
because it is perfect.

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:48.597
Everything is.

01:07:50.901 --> 01:07:52.867
I am so sorry,
you guys.

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:54.202
I gotta leave
for L.A.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:55.336
for a last-minute
meeting.

01:07:55.372 --> 01:07:56.504
Now?

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:57.672
Right now.

01:07:57.707 --> 01:07:59.352
[Ginger]: But the wedding
is in three days.

01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:01.096
I don't really have a choice.
It's for work.

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:02.822
But I'll be back first thing
in the morning on the 23rd,

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:05.413
it's only for a day.
I'll be back in plenty of time.

01:08:05.449 --> 01:08:06.449
We'll pick up
the slack.

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:08.817
What about studying?

01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:10.785
It can wait.

01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:13.755
I really wish
I didn't have to go.

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:15.190
Me too.

01:08:15.225 --> 01:08:17.258

Maddie, you haven't
stopped smiling

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.941
since we got here.

01:08:33.009 --> 01:08:34.442
I can't help it.

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:36.877
Well,
it's nice to see.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.179
Ed, no!

01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:40.381
I'm just checking
the football score.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:41.381
No sports tonight.

It'll just
take a second.

01:08:43.019 --> 01:08:44.118
Okay, you two.

He said he had
a meeting.

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:55.296
He didn't say that.

01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:56.363
[Loretta]: Maddie...

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:57.399

Honey.

I knew this
was gonna happen.

trusted my gut.

Oh! I'm such an idiot.

Why did I
do this to myself?

Oh, you're probably
overreacting.

01:09:09.613 --> 01:09:11.912
Did you see the way
that he was smiling at her?

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.149
It was just easier
when I was

01:09:15.185 --> 01:09:16.551
his sister's wedding planner,

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.520
and he was the checkbook.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.724

please come in?

Why are there paparazzi

I was about to ask you
the same question.

01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:47.916
Maybe they want to hear
about your new relationship.

01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:49.584
Well...
here we are.

do this to me.

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:55.957
I didn't!

Oh, you didn't hear
that your romantic date

01:10:08.004 --> 01:10:09.737
was all over national TV?

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:11.306
It wasn't a date!

01:10:11.341 --> 01:10:14.475
It was a dinner set up by
the producers of <i> Fire's Edge.</i>

01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:15.755
They wanted Natalie
to sweet-talk me

01:10:15.779 --> 01:10:17.145
into doing another sequel.

01:10:18.682 --> 01:10:21.082
Do you really think I would've
said all those things to you

01:10:21.117 --> 01:10:23.017
and then just gone
and dated someone else?

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:24.197
Do you really think
that I would post

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:27.388
photos of us online
for free publicity?

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:31.659
Wow. You really don't trust me.

01:10:33.163 --> 01:10:35.330
I guess about as much
as you trusted me.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.100
I guess my first instincts
were right.

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:43.705
Why don't we just
get through Ginger's wedding,

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.207
and then you can go back
to your real life...

01:10:46.243 --> 01:10:47.842
and I'll go back to mine.

01:10:50.814 --> 01:10:52.247
Fine.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.417
[door slams]

01:10:57.554 --> 01:10:59.254
[door bangs]

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:00.555
Once this wedding
is over,

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:01.867
we are splitting up
this business.

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:02.969
I will do wedding planning.

01:11:02.993 --> 01:11:04.092
You will do dresses.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.526
I just can't work
with you anymore.

01:11:05.562 --> 01:11:07.562
Wait. Maddie, wait!

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:11.366
[breath catches, sighs]

01:11:12.636 --> 01:11:15.169
[♪♪♪]

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:22.477
Wonderful.
Just put it right here.

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.350
[sighs contentedly]

01:11:29.419 --> 01:11:31.152
Thank you.

01:11:31.187 --> 01:11:32.187
[door creaks]

01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:35.490
[♪♪♪]

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:42.864
I brought the veil.

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:47.168
Thanks.

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:54.575
[♪♪♪]

01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:58.179
Wow. Maddie...

01:11:58.214 --> 01:12:00.848
you've created
magic in here.

01:12:00.884 --> 01:12:03.017
This is the most beautiful
Christmas wedding

01:12:03.053 --> 01:12:04.185
I've ever seen.

01:12:06.156 --> 01:12:07.588
I can't really talk, Iz.

01:12:07.624 --> 01:12:08.923
Okay, then I'll talk.

01:12:11.094 --> 01:12:13.227
I just came to tell
you in person...

01:12:13.263 --> 01:12:15.396
[tearfully]:
...how sorry I am.

01:12:15.432 --> 01:12:17.832
I was just trying
to save the business,

01:12:17.867 --> 01:12:19.901
and I... I panicked.

01:12:19.969 --> 01:12:21.035
Iz...

01:12:21.071 --> 01:12:22.970
you lied to me.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:25.206
I know, and I am...

01:12:25.275 --> 01:12:27.408
I am so, so sorry.

01:12:30.914 --> 01:12:32.513
I've already
apologized to Johnny,

01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:33.948
if that makes a difference.

01:12:37.253 --> 01:12:38.986
So he knows it was you?

01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:42.190
I called him last night.

01:12:42.225 --> 01:12:44.492
I hated the idea
that you guys

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:46.427
weren't together
because of me.

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:48.229
It wasn't gonna
work out anyway.

01:12:48.264 --> 01:12:51.099
You just sped up
the inevitable.

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:55.336
We didn't even need Johnny
for the publicity.

01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:57.505
I've been posting
your idea boards

01:12:57.507 --> 01:12:58.873
all over our social media,

01:12:58.908 --> 01:13:00.708
and we have gotten
so much more traffic

01:13:00.777 --> 01:13:01.976
just based on that alone,

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:03.111
but Maddie...

01:13:04.581 --> 01:13:07.448
When people see
what you've done here,

01:13:07.484 --> 01:13:08.816
you're gonna be huge.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.553
You really think so?

01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:13.855
I know so.

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:18.059
This is all you.

01:13:19.496 --> 01:13:21.763
Well, none of this
would've been possible

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:24.732
if you had not
laid the foundation.

01:13:24.768 --> 01:13:26.300
Thank you for that.

01:13:28.805 --> 01:13:30.171
So, what do you say?

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.808
Can we stay
business partners?

01:13:33.843 --> 01:13:36.377
But more importantly,

01:13:36.446 --> 01:13:38.546
can we stay friends?

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.284
[takes a shaky breath, grumbles]

01:13:43.319 --> 01:13:45.787
One breakup is enough.

01:13:45.822 --> 01:13:47.688
Come here.

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:49.023
Ohh.

01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:53.661
Hey there, JB!

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:55.196
Hi, Ed.

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:56.597
Is that
for the wedding?

01:13:56.633 --> 01:13:58.866
Yep. It's Oliver's
groom's cake.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:00.501
- May I?
- Yep.

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:02.637
[Ed]: Is... Is that a heart?

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:03.705
Yep.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:04.740
[laughs]

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:05.940
Oh, I love that guy.

01:14:06.009 --> 01:14:08.209
Okay. Uh, why don't
you have a seat?

01:14:08.244 --> 01:14:09.844
You know, I should
probably get going.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.080
Okay.

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:13.381
Yeah.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.821
You know,
I never had a son,

01:14:19.889 --> 01:14:23.124
so I'm probably
gonna stink at this,

01:14:23.193 --> 01:14:25.226
but I know
your dad's gone,

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:26.661
so, can I offer you

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:28.830
a little unsolicited
fatherly advice?

01:14:28.865 --> 01:14:30.498
No.

01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:32.867
[laughs] Tough.

01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:34.802
[laughing]
Good start!

01:14:34.838 --> 01:14:36.437
Yeah.

01:14:36.473 --> 01:14:38.806
Listen, um.

01:14:38.842 --> 01:14:40.875
Don't give up on Maddie.

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:43.377
She's just afraid of
having her heart broken.

01:14:43.413 --> 01:14:45.079
Who can blame her?

01:14:45.114 --> 01:14:48.249
You can see how much
I care about her, Ed.

01:14:48.318 --> 01:14:49.361
But if she
doesn't trust me,

01:14:49.385 --> 01:14:51.219
then how can it work?

01:14:51.287 --> 01:14:52.620
From what I hear,

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:53.921
you could use
a little work

01:14:53.957 --> 01:14:55.289
in the trust
department yourself.

01:14:55.325 --> 01:14:56.557
I know, I know.

01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:57.703
I was gonna
apologize to Maddie

01:14:57.727 --> 01:14:58.759
the next time I saw her,

01:14:58.795 --> 01:14:59.872
but what difference
would it make?

01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:02.096
She still thinks
I'm with someone else.

01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:05.366
Well, you gotta look at things
from Maddie's perspective.

01:15:05.401 --> 01:15:07.401
I mean, she sees you
here in Fool's Gold,

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.770
and you're this
nice, normal guy,

01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:11.973
then all of a sudden,
on TV,

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:15.243
there's "Johnny Blake"
doing "Johnny Blake" things.

01:15:15.278 --> 01:15:17.245
I know.
That's not really me.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.779
I don't even want
that life anymore.

01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:21.483
You know, after
that dinner in L.A.,

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:22.917
I made a decision.

01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:26.354
Told my agent it was
time to make some changes,

01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:28.689
start heading down
a different path.

01:15:28.725 --> 01:15:31.359
And what path is that?

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:34.161
The path that leads here.

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:36.297
This is the first
time in my life

01:15:36.366 --> 01:15:38.366
that I've actually
felt whole.

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:40.501
You know, I don't
want to lose that.

01:15:40.537 --> 01:15:42.069
And I think
I've made enough money

01:15:42.105 --> 01:15:44.372
to where
I don't have to.

01:15:44.407 --> 01:15:46.674
I could actually
live here,

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:48.442
and work when
I want to work.

01:15:48.478 --> 01:15:50.278
Well, sounds
like you found

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:52.113
a little something
called "balance."

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:54.115
Yeah, but if
Maddie's not with me,

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:55.249
then what's the point?

01:15:55.285 --> 01:15:56.884
I don't want to be here
without her.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.452
I got one question.

01:15:58.521 --> 01:16:01.155
Why aren't you
telling her all of this?

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:04.058
I can't even get her
to talk to me one-on-one.

01:16:05.361 --> 01:16:06.661
Wait a minute.

01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:07.862
I know where
she's gonna be

01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:08.971
standing
right next to you,

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:10.431
with no escape.

01:16:10.466 --> 01:16:13.401
"I now pronounce you
man and wife."

01:16:13.436 --> 01:16:15.603
[laughs]

01:16:15.638 --> 01:16:18.239
I think you're rushing
things just a little bit, Ed.

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:19.373
[laughing]

01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:20.908
Not you, fool!

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:22.843
[keeps laughing]

01:16:22.879 --> 01:16:26.180
No, after Ginger and Oliver
walk back down the aisle,

01:16:26.215 --> 01:16:28.416
who you are you gonna
be standing right next to?

01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:30.418
All alone.

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:33.721
[laughs] Oh, right.

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:35.423
Huh.

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:37.058
You know, you're, uh...

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:39.226
pretty good at
this father/son stuff, Ed.

01:16:40.530 --> 01:16:42.964
Stick around awhile,

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:44.510
I'll show you how to fish
and change a tire.

01:16:44.534 --> 01:16:46.033
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:47.401
I'd like that.

01:16:47.437 --> 01:16:48.469
So would I.

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:52.940
[♪♪

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:56.310
You look
beautiful, Ginger.

01:16:56.346 --> 01:16:59.547
Everything is perfect,
thanks to you.

01:16:59.616 --> 01:17:02.783
I wouldn't change
a minute of it.

01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:04.418
I just wish you would
talk to Johnny

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:06.921
before the wedding.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:09.023
We are not gonna talk
about that today.

01:17:09.058 --> 01:17:11.892
Today is about you.

01:17:11.928 --> 01:17:14.362
But you're meant to be!

01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:15.663
We're not.

01:17:15.698 --> 01:17:17.598
It's too hard.

01:17:17.634 --> 01:17:20.968
Who ever said it was
supposed to be easy?

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:23.170
If you care about each other,
and I know you do,

01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:24.305
you find a way.

01:17:25.575 --> 01:17:27.241
Are a few
misunderstandings

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:29.443
worth giving up
on happiness?

01:17:29.512 --> 01:17:30.856
It's not just
the misunderstandings

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.846
themselves.

01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:33.314
It's the fact

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:35.850
that we immediately
thought the worst.

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:38.586
We aren't ready.

01:17:39.756 --> 01:17:41.555
You were ready.

01:17:41.591 --> 01:17:43.457
You were both just scared.

01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:48.262
Hey, isn't
the Maid of Honor

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:50.564
supposed to help
the bride today?

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.866
Not vice-versa.

01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:55.036
Since when do we do
anything by the book?

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:57.738
That's a good point.

01:17:57.774 --> 01:17:59.073
[laughs]

01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:03.611
Okay.

01:18:06.215 --> 01:18:08.015
It's time to get you married.
