00:00.000 --> 00:01.735
- Previously on "All Stars"...

00:01.735 --> 00:04.037
10 of my fiercest queens

00:04.037 --> 00:07.174
return for a spot
in the Drag Race Hall of Fame.

00:07.174 --> 00:11.278
- The energy in the room
is so focused.

00:11.278 --> 00:12.846
They're all ready to attack.

00:16.049 --> 00:19.119
- This got really real
really quick.

00:19.119 --> 00:20.854
- Who the fuck
is going home today?

00:20.854 --> 00:25.626
- Welcome to our All Star
Spangled Variety Show.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.094
It's Monique Heart.

00:27.094 --> 00:28.228
- This is a great way

00:28.228 --> 00:30.464
to enter this competition
with momentum.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.199
- Didn't you mean moo-mentum?

00:32.199 --> 00:33.834
- Trinity The Tuck.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.402
- Is that uncomfortable, though?

00:35.402 --> 00:37.237
- If you only knew.
[all laugh]

00:37.237 --> 00:39.373
- It's Jasmine Masters.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.341
- Your breath smell like
you have been doing nothing

00:41.341 --> 00:43.343
but eating on assholes.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.679
- Did you prepare that at all?

00:45.679 --> 00:46.747
- No.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.383
- It's Farrah Moan.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.018
Oh!

00:51.018 --> 00:53.987
- Leave that nervous shit home.
It's boring.

00:55.088 --> 00:56.590
- Trinity The Tuck.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.425
Con-drag-ulations.
You're a winner, baby.

00:58.425 --> 01:01.261
[applause]

01:01.261 --> 01:05.499
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

01:05.499 --> 01:07.200
- The person
I've decided to go with...

01:08.669 --> 01:11.038
is Jasmine.

01:11.038 --> 01:13.874
- Jasmine, sashay away.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.450
- Whew.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.252
Poor Juj.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.921
- Oh, Jasmine.
- Oh...

01:27.921 --> 01:30.123
- The first queen has gone home.

01:30.123 --> 01:33.093
Our beloved sister,
Miss Jasmine, chopped.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.696
The honeymoon phase is over.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.965
Stuff just got real real, y'all.

01:37.965 --> 01:40.801
The goopery, the gaggery,
it is real.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.971
- "Hey juj, much to you all.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.505
Kick faith, love Jasmine."

01:45.505 --> 01:46.740
- I mean, she's "Drag Race"--

01:46.740 --> 01:48.275
- Legend.
- Royalty.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.609
- Right.
- Legend.

01:49.609 --> 01:50.978
- How do you feel, girl?

01:50.978 --> 01:53.013
- This you can't
prepare yourself

01:53.013 --> 01:54.648
for how you're going to feel.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.184
I'm not a crier,
and it made me think

01:57.184 --> 01:59.920
of, like, how I feel
about this competition.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.455
What I want.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.723
It was hard.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.227
So just prepare yourself.

02:07.227 --> 02:08.695
It's not gonna be easy.

02:08.695 --> 02:11.398
- Trinity needs to get over
this feeling

02:11.398 --> 02:12.899
of regret and remorse

02:12.899 --> 02:15.235
and "Woe is me,
I had to send someone home."

02:15.235 --> 02:17.037
It's part of the game, girl.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.939
Like, you might lose
a friendship here or there,

02:18.939 --> 02:20.540
but you know what?

02:20.540 --> 02:22.909
You're $10.000 richer,
girl, you know.

02:22.909 --> 02:27.347
You can buy friends.
[laughs]

02:27.347 --> 02:28.782
Well, congratulations, girl.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.783
You guys were
the top of the week.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.151
- I felt good in my lip sync.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.487
I'm happy that my hair loss
was iconic in the rafters.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.022
[all laugh]

02:35.022 --> 02:37.157
- She was in
the stratosphere, bitch.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.694
- Girl, if you have a wig
come off your head,

02:40.694 --> 02:43.864
some other something better
be up underneath your wig.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.700
And this ain't the first time
I'm looking at your bald head.

02:46.700 --> 02:50.237
Brown cow's thing?
Not so much.

02:50.237 --> 02:51.705
- Who's lip syncing your kitty?

02:51.705 --> 02:52.839
- Oh, yeah.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.275
- Yours.
[all laugh]

02:55.275 --> 02:56.977
I chose Jasmine.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.680
Farrah, I love you,
and I told you--

02:59.680 --> 03:00.881
When you started crying,
I was like she's getting it.

03:00.881 --> 03:01.982
I'm sending her home.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.284
And it wasn't until
you stopped crying

03:04.284 --> 03:06.987
and you were like
I want this so bad,

03:06.987 --> 03:09.523
and it threw me all the way back
to my season

03:09.523 --> 03:10.757
when I got eliminated,
and I was like

03:10.757 --> 03:12.959
this is not supposed
to be my time, I'm sorry.

03:12.959 --> 03:14.895
If someone could have
given me grace in that moment

03:14.895 --> 03:17.664
for a fumble, then I would
like that same grace.

03:17.664 --> 03:18.999
- Thank you.

03:18.999 --> 03:22.502
I can't even begin to express
how thankful I am

03:22.502 --> 03:25.739
that I am getting a second
chance in this competition.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.208
I'm not a fuck-up
and I'm not untalented.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.010
I just messed up.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.145
I'm excited
to have a second chance,

03:32.145 --> 03:36.716
and literally, like, watch out,
I'm about to fuck this up.

03:36.716 --> 03:40.320
- That little beautiful bitch
was lucky today.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.522
But this is a show about talent,

03:42.522 --> 03:44.324
and looking pretty isn't enough.

03:44.324 --> 03:47.360
If she's just
going to rely on that beauty,

03:47.360 --> 03:49.296
somebody's gonna serve it
to her soon.

03:49.296 --> 03:51.631
So let the games begin.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.770

04:43.717 --> 04:45.318

about this look?

04:45.318 --> 04:47.787

sleek, and chic.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.218

If you want to earn your place
in the Drag Race Hall of Fame,

Now, performing in two teams,

05:55.188 --> 05:57.991
each of you will need
to write your own lyrics,

Leland and Freddy Scott,

06:03.730 --> 06:05.899
who've worked

06:05.899 --> 06:09.069
like Troye Sivan

06:09.069 --> 06:11.271
[cheers and applause]
- Okay. Come on.

06:11.271 --> 06:15.141
- Plus you'll be creating
your own group choreography

06:15.141 --> 06:19.212
and then you'll style
your individual looks.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.148
Trinity The Tuck
and Monique Heart,

06:22.148 --> 06:25.719
since you were the top two
All Stars last week,

06:25.719 --> 06:28.154
you are the team captains.

06:28.154 --> 06:30.257

- Yeah! Okay.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.491
- Here we go.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.693

you get to choose first.

- Come on, Manila.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.754
[cheers]

07:00.754 --> 07:04.524
- All right, that leaves
Gia Gunn and Farrah Moan.

07:04.524 --> 07:07.093
- I actually thought I was going
to be the first one picked.

07:07.093 --> 07:10.230
I don't think any of these girls
really know what I do

07:10.230 --> 07:11.698
other than look gorgeous.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.566
Maybe they're just intimidated.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.201
- Monique, who do you choose?

07:15.201 --> 07:16.636
- Miss Farrah Moan.

07:16.636 --> 07:18.171
- Oh.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.274
- All right,
that means Gia Gunn,

07:21.274 --> 07:23.610
you are Team Trinity The Tuck.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.711
- Aw.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.613
So you got stuck with me
anyway. You see?

07:26.613 --> 07:27.981
- We are happy.
We are happy.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.216
- Now I'm going to show you
how the real tuck is done.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.384
[all laugh]

07:31.384 --> 07:34.087
- Team Trinity,
you'll be performing the track

07:34.087 --> 07:35.455
"Don't Funk It Up."

07:35.455 --> 07:37.190
- Yes, honey.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.460
- Team Monique,
you'll be performing the track

07:40.460 --> 07:42.162
"Everybody Say Love."

07:42.162 --> 07:43.730
- Everybody say love.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.098
- Love.
- Love.

07:45.098 --> 07:49.035
- Now, ladies, Henny is not
your average girl group.

07:49.035 --> 07:51.671
In fact, it's a collaboration,

07:51.671 --> 07:54.941
featuring one of my
all-time favorite queens

07:54.941 --> 07:56.509
in "Drag Race" herstory.

07:56.509 --> 08:00.213
I'm talking
the original Henny-Henny.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.514
[cheers]

08:01.514 --> 08:02.782
That's right.

08:02.782 --> 08:05.785
From Backswamp, North Carolina,

08:05.785 --> 08:08.321
please welcome
Stacy Layne Matthews.

08:08.321 --> 08:12.792
[cheers and applause]

08:12.792 --> 08:16.429
- The Henny, like,
the motherfucking Henny.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.331
Oh, my gosh, a fucking legend.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.799
- Wow.

08:19.799 --> 08:21.701
- Now that's
the "Jingle Bell Rock."

08:21.701 --> 08:22.802
- I'm gonna go tell her, Henny.

08:22.802 --> 08:25.739
- Henny is in the house,
Henny.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.173
- Who the fuck is here
that I'd want to know?

08:27.173 --> 08:28.274
Is Precious back there?

08:28.274 --> 08:29.709
She better be cooking me
something to eat.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.378
I feel like it's couture.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.246
- That meme of her
in the Season 8 finale,

08:33.246 --> 08:35.548
it'll be ingrained
in everyone's brain forever.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.084
- Shake it. Ooh!

08:38.084 --> 08:39.319
- I really love her.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.221
Like, when I see her,
it does something to me.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.590
- Mmm. Mmm.

08:43.590 --> 08:46.126
- [whines]

08:46.126 --> 08:50.397
- Now, ladies, Stacy is our
artist in residence this week.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.098
You will be judged

08:52.098 --> 08:56.036
on how well you feature
her extraordinary talents.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.872
Stacy, darling, are you ready
to share the spotlight

08:58.872 --> 09:00.373
with my All Stars?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.608
- Well, you know
what they say, Ru.

09:01.608 --> 09:04.344
Never work with animals,
children, or drag queens.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.545
[all laugh]

09:05.545 --> 09:07.881
- But for you, Mother Ru,
I'll do anything.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.482
- Oh, good.
- Henny.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.650
- All right.
[laughter and applause]

09:10.650 --> 09:11.951
- All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:11.951 --> 09:16.289
Start your engines,
and may the best All Star win.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.124
[cheers and applause]

09:18.124 --> 09:20.293
- "Everybody Say Love."

09:21.361 --> 09:23.129
- Oh, my gosh, you can--
do it again.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.632
- All right, girl.
- [laughs]

09:25.632 --> 09:27.367
- She didn't do that, you know,
the white-girl twerk.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.035
When you do this.
- With the shoulders.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.171
- All right, Farrah Moan.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.506
- She was that one white girl
that can twerk at the club.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.542
As team captain,
I just need to make sure

09:35.542 --> 09:37.777
that my team
can come out on top

09:37.777 --> 09:40.246
with lyrics and choreography.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.382
I know I'm going to be stunning
at whatever I do.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.585
We need to shine together
as a group cohesively,

09:45.585 --> 09:49.089
but also make sure
that we shine individual.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.024
And no tears.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.592
- No tears. Hell, no.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.728
- Farrah allegedly has a fire
under her booty to work better,

09:55.728 --> 09:57.096
but just last week,

09:57.096 --> 09:59.265
the bitch could barely dance
to her own fucking number

09:59.265 --> 10:00.867
that she knows all the moves to.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.169
How's she gonna do
a choreographed challenge, girl?

10:03.169 --> 10:04.737
Sabotage.

10:04.737 --> 10:05.805
- Three, two, one, say love.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.006
- Three, two, one.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.374
- Love.
- Love.

10:08.374 --> 10:09.476
- Oh, my God,
it would be so cute

10:09.476 --> 10:11.811
if we can harmonize
that last note.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.881
- We can add in
a little unh-aiy.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.716
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

10:16.716 --> 10:17.851
[all laugh]

10:17.851 --> 10:19.719
- Rrrrap on, rrrrap on.

10:19.719 --> 10:23.523
- The song that we are assigned
is "Don't Funk It Up."

10:23.523 --> 10:25.792
And I feel good about this team.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.393
- I'm thinking more
inspirational message.

10:27.393 --> 10:28.394
- Right.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.063
- So right here, I've said,

10:30.063 --> 10:31.598
for those of you
who don't know me,

10:31.598 --> 10:33.600
I put the "T" in the LGB.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.701
- Yeah.
- Oh.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.002
- Okay.

10:36.002 --> 10:39.272
- Mine's going to be more about
if you do funk it up,

10:39.272 --> 10:41.074
get back up and keep going.

10:41.074 --> 10:45.345
So if you Farrah on your ass,
you just gotta keep going.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.946
- I was just so nervous

10:46.946 --> 10:49.883
that me and Farrah were
going to be in the same group.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.518
I don't know if y'all knew this,

10:51.518 --> 10:54.888
but me and Farrah had a big
falling-out a couple months ago.

10:54.888 --> 10:55.855
- No.

10:55.855 --> 10:57.023
- At one point,

10:57.023 --> 11:00.093
I considered Farrah
to be a close friend.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.362
But she tried to go about

11:02.362 --> 11:05.865
patching up a relationship
between me and another person

11:05.865 --> 11:08.301
in an inappropriate way.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.004
And while I'm at work,
they showed up drunk,

11:11.004 --> 11:13.306
and so I kind of
let her have it,

11:13.306 --> 11:16.009
and the other girl have it
at the same time.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.579
I texted her and she
just didn't respond to me.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.648
So seeing her
walk into this workroom,

11:21.648 --> 11:22.682
I was a little gagged,

11:22.682 --> 11:24.517
because I did cherish
our friendship,

11:24.517 --> 11:26.753
but she kind of
fucked it up a little bit.

11:26.753 --> 11:27.921
- Man.
- She funked it up.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.022
- She funked it.
- She funked it up.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.390
And bitch,
I was kind of hoping

11:30.390 --> 11:32.625
that you were gonna
vote her off.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.861
I just don't want our drama

11:34.861 --> 11:38.565
to be a distraction for me
during this competition.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.899
- I think that while you guys

11:39.899 --> 11:42.035
are stuck here
in this workroom together,

11:42.035 --> 11:45.004
it's a perfect opportunity
for you to address it.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.272
- I agree. Without
the outside influences.

11:46.272 --> 11:47.373
- Yeah.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.642
- Just me and you, baby.
What's going on?

11:49.642 --> 11:52.211
- I am not trying
to get in the middle

11:52.211 --> 11:53.413
of all of this bullshit.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.248
Girl, figure it out.
Move on.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.283
Sounds like high school
bullshit to me.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.252
I just don't think you should
even worry about it.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.354
- Oh, honey,
I'm not worried about it.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.389
I don't know if "All Stars"
is the place

12:03.389 --> 12:06.192
to be focused
on our unfinished business,

12:06.192 --> 12:10.063
but I hope that we can
kind of talk things out

12:10.063 --> 12:12.565
because I'm sure that
she'll get the chop soon.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.670
- Hi.
- Hello, gentlemen.

12:17.670 --> 12:18.905
- Welcome, everybody.

12:18.905 --> 12:22.542
- This week's main stage
challenge is girl groups.

12:22.542 --> 12:25.211
So now it's time to record
our hit single,

12:25.211 --> 12:26.446
"Everybody Say Love."

12:26.446 --> 12:28.748
- My name is Leland,
and this is Freddy.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.950
And we put these two songs
together.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.185
You're singing along with Lizzo.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.519
Lizzo is on these choruses.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.254
- Yes!
- How fun is that?

12:35.254 --> 12:37.790
- Her lip sync sent me home,
so I feel a little shaded.

12:37.790 --> 12:38.858
But we'll work it out.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.627
- Shredded.
- Hello.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.829
- So as a team, who do you feel
is the strongest singer?

12:42.829 --> 12:45.498
[bell dings]

12:45.498 --> 12:47.834
- There have not been
a lot of good singers

12:47.834 --> 12:49.569
out of the "Drag Race" family.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.704
You know, there's Adore,
she's a good one.

12:51.704 --> 12:55.074
There's Jujubee. I think
she's a really good one.

17:08.427 --> 17:10.029
[all laugh]

17:10.029 --> 17:11.998
- I knew what I was picking,
bitch.

17:11.998 --> 17:15.034
- Okay, Manila, tell me about
your singing experience.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.335
- I love to sing.

17:16.335 --> 17:19.272
I like to make records
and I like to make music videos.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.540
I do this a lot.
I have many songs.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.142
And I perform all the time,

17:23.142 --> 17:24.510
so this should be easy for me.

17:24.510 --> 17:27.780

but now you just
have to sell me on it.

17:47.833 --> 17:51.604

18:15.728 --> 18:17.163

18:17.163 --> 18:18.397
- Oh, girl.
- Oh.

18:18.397 --> 18:19.832
- I'm a little worried

18:19.832 --> 18:21.267
because when it comes
to team challenges,

18:21.267 --> 18:23.369
you're only as strong
as your weakest link.

- What's going on, Henny?
- Hello, darling.

18:36.315 --> 18:37.683
Ready to do some splits
and stuff?

18:37.683 --> 18:39.518
[all laugh]
- Yeah, some death drops?

18:39.518 --> 18:41.354
- It's time to rehearse
the choreography

18:41.354 --> 18:43.022
for our super girl
group performance

18:43.022 --> 18:47.393
featuring the one,
the only Henny.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.794
Stacy Layne Matthews.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.296
- So have you guys been
working on choreography?

18:50.296 --> 18:51.497
- Yeah.
- Yes.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.099
- We have. We know
that you are the feature,

18:53.099 --> 18:54.367
so we want to make you

18:54.367 --> 18:57.970
the most beautiful Beyoncé
that works like Kelly.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.171
[all laugh]
You know what I mean?

18:59.171 --> 19:00.239
- Okay, honey.

19:00.239 --> 19:03.209
The judges are looking for

19:03.209 --> 19:06.846
how well the group
incorporates me into the number.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.247
Wait, I'm not doing the splits.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.616
Honey, I'm not doing
a death drop

19:10.616 --> 19:13.919
because that would be the end
of Stacy Layne Matthews, honey.

19:13.919 --> 19:17.423
And I promise you, this studio
would have a basement.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.425
- [laughs]

19:19.425 --> 19:20.626
- So you won't turn around

19:20.626 --> 19:23.062
until the song goes

19:23.062 --> 19:24.330

19:26.832 --> 19:29.001
'Cause we want you
to have a good pooch.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.371
As team captain, I have
to come up with choreography.

19:32.371 --> 19:35.041
Then I have to
teach the choreography.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.842
We have to perfect
the choreography

19:36.842 --> 19:39.378
and then perform
the choreography.

19:39.378 --> 19:43.282

I'm stepping out.

and to your spot.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.092
One, two, ready, go.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.727
- I still go this way?
- Yeah.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.895
- Oh.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.731
- So you just bum-ta-da-bum,
bum-ta-da-bum.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.200
One, two, three, bang.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.201
- Pressure, honey.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.470
- When I thought girl group,

20:04.470 --> 20:06.605
I thought
I was going to be doing

20:06.605 --> 20:10.209
some fun little Britney-isms,
some hair flips.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.343
I didn't really think

20:11.343 --> 20:13.746
we were going to be all,
you know, getting down.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.381
[laughs]

20:15.381 --> 20:16.949
- Du-du-du-du-du-du-du.

20:16.949 --> 20:22.822
I'm here...
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.291
- See, I end up like all the way
over here with that.

20:25.291 --> 20:28.127
- But you can't go
too far, my love.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.762
Because see I was here,
and I just go.

20:29.762 --> 20:32.398
It's all in the movement.
You don't have to go.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.699
- Take smaller steps.

20:33.699 --> 20:34.667
- Yeah, smaller steps
so you don't travel as far,

20:34.667 --> 20:35.801
you see what I'm saying?

20:35.801 --> 20:37.002
- My spot's already
right here already.

20:37.002 --> 20:38.771
- So then fake it
in that one spot.

20:38.771 --> 20:42.575
Miss Farrah is plucking
my last nerve, America.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.343
Okay, so let's just say
sorry, sorry, sorry,

20:44.343 --> 20:45.411
for the sake of time.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.313
We're trying
to do a whole lot.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.148
- Yeah.
- Whoo, honey.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.282
Too many things.

20:50.282 --> 20:53.152
- I think Monique
kind of receives ideas

20:53.152 --> 20:54.386
and just moves on.

20:54.386 --> 20:57.823
She doesn't give people
time to process things.

20:57.823 --> 21:00.059
Well, your brain
has to process shit, girl.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.328
- Say love, say love.

21:02.328 --> 21:04.263
Farrah, Farrah, come over here.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.732
- Oh. So we're not doing
the leg kick anymore.

21:06.732 --> 21:07.733
- No, because we need
to get you on this side.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.769
- Okay.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.104
The choreography
is coming off super messy.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.140
I keep wanting
to like simplify it,

21:14.140 --> 21:15.508
and I'm kind of
getting shut down.

21:15.508 --> 21:18.444
But I will just shut up
and let Monique do it,

21:18.444 --> 21:20.246
and if this all
crashes and burns,

21:20.246 --> 21:21.480
she's the team captain,

21:21.480 --> 21:24.183
and I guess she can take,
you know, the fall.

21:24.183 --> 21:25.317
- You look stressed.

21:25.317 --> 21:28.554
- I am a little bit stressed
with this.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.256
- We'll work it out.
- No stress.

21:31.757 --> 21:33.626

21:33.626 --> 21:34.960

21:37.062 --> 21:39.932
- Being on stage

21:39.932 --> 21:41.734

these other bitches

21:41.734 --> 21:43.636

21:43.636 --> 21:45.671
- Well, let's see what
we're working with, honey.

21:45.671 --> 21:46.906
- I'm what, here?

21:46.906 --> 21:49.141
- No, you are...
you are here.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.111
Here, Manila, and then Henny.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.946
- No, but like
we're making a "V", right?

21:53.946 --> 21:55.614
- Let's just walk
to our places first

21:55.614 --> 21:57.817
before we even start
doing the choreography.

21:57.817 --> 21:58.851

- Start with the right foot?

22:06.759 --> 22:07.793
- Yes.

22:07.793 --> 22:10.262
- So once we get
to the first position,

22:10.262 --> 22:12.064
then we start doing our...
No, no, no.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.365
The march thing.

22:13.365 --> 22:17.970
So we can march here,
turn, get back to your spot.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.638
- I think we should
start it off here.

22:19.638 --> 22:21.340
- Who's team leader?

22:21.340 --> 22:23.042
- Her.
- Oh, okay.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.277
- Why don't we just do do-do-do?

22:25.277 --> 22:27.646
- What if the simple idea is

♪ If you want to funk it,
don't funk it up ♪

22:30.416 --> 22:32.585
- No, because
we should be in a square.

22:32.585 --> 22:35.754
- Basically there was
17 cooks in the kitchen.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.590
All the servers done quit,
honey.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.592
I was like, girl,
who's cooking this cake, honey?

22:39.592 --> 22:43.295
Chaos, honey, chaos.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.397
- So if we're getting there
really early,

22:45.397 --> 22:47.099
then we need to figure out
something to do.

22:47.099 --> 22:50.202
- That's why I didn't like
the marching idea.

22:50.202 --> 22:53.939
- I'm trying to like
sift through all this

22:53.939 --> 22:56.675
without seeming like a dictator.

22:56.675 --> 22:59.345

23:12.424 --> 23:13.859

group performance.

23:13.859 --> 23:18.564
And I'm feeling my oats, wheats,
grains, thins, and oatmeal.

23:18.564 --> 23:19.565
One, two, three.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.967
- Oh!
- [laughs]

23:21.967 --> 23:23.736
- That is not good, girl.
- No.

23:23.736 --> 23:28.474
- Today's look giving you
cocktails in Palm Springs.

23:28.474 --> 23:30.075
- We need to get you
some human hair wigs

23:30.075 --> 23:31.644
so you can whip it around
for real.

23:31.644 --> 23:34.680
- Yeah.
My girl group character

23:34.680 --> 23:37.916
is kind of based off Aaliyah
for a little bit.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.652
So I'm really inspired
by Aaliyah's look

23:39.652 --> 23:41.153
from "Dust Yourself Off."

23:41.153 --> 23:42.588
But I think it'll be good
because--

23:42.588 --> 23:44.356
- Team leader.
- Yes, ma'am.

23:44.356 --> 23:45.991
- Are you feeling your oats
over here?

23:45.991 --> 23:49.328
- Yeah. I'm really excited
for our, like, girls

23:49.328 --> 23:52.731
to get out there
and do what it is that we do.

23:52.731 --> 23:53.799
You know what I mean?

23:55.467 --> 23:57.303
Love her. She, uh--

23:57.303 --> 23:58.370
- Uh-uh, bitch, don't lie to me.

23:58.370 --> 23:59.405
- No, no, no, I didn't.

23:59.405 --> 24:01.206
She triggers me,
but she didn't--

24:01.206 --> 24:03.709
♪ Uh... ♪

24:03.709 --> 24:05.911
- Just be honest.

24:05.911 --> 24:08.480
- I would say, yeah,
but she is fighting.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.815
She's doing it.

24:09.815 --> 24:11.784
- It's clear that Farrah's
teammates think that she

24:11.784 --> 24:13.986
is probably going
to fuck this up for them.

24:13.986 --> 24:16.989
And in case she gets sent home,

24:16.989 --> 24:19.391
I just want to make sure
that I did my part

24:19.391 --> 24:22.995
in terms of reaching out to her
and trying to squash this drama

24:22.995 --> 24:25.364
so that I can have closure.

24:25.364 --> 24:27.900
- You getting ready already?

24:27.900 --> 24:29.068
- Yeah.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.569
- Yeah, do your makeup
and get ready, sweetie,

24:30.569 --> 24:32.538
'cause according to your team,
you're the weakest link.

24:32.538 --> 24:34.640
- Oh!
- Oh, shit.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.909
- Oh, here we go.

24:36.909 --> 24:40.112
- Listen, I'm like way less
concerned about everybody else.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.914
Like, you don't see me,
like, going around

24:41.914 --> 24:44.383
and trying to get in everybody's
head and focusing on me.

24:44.383 --> 24:46.585
If my team thinks
that I'm the weakest link,

24:46.585 --> 24:48.887
then obviously I need to be
doing exactly what I'm doing

24:48.887 --> 24:51.724
and getting centered, balanced,
and my makeup done.

24:51.724 --> 24:54.360
And so maybe
you should do the same.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.595
Because I feel like
only insecure people,

24:56.595 --> 24:59.631
like, go around and try
and do what you're doing.

24:59.631 --> 25:01.533
- Oh, sweetie, I'm very secure.
Are you secure?

25:01.533 --> 25:05.104
- Okay. It is taking everything
in my power right now

25:05.104 --> 25:08.006
not to completely go
the fuck off on this bitch.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.576
- Clearly you don't really
care about our friendship

25:10.576 --> 25:11.944
or anything that we had.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.178
- [sighs]

25:13.178 --> 25:14.747
- So I was just trying to--

25:14.747 --> 25:16.648
- Gia, I'm trying to get ready.
- Okay.

25:16.648 --> 25:18.450
- I don't have time
for your drama.

25:18.450 --> 25:21.320
I feel like you're
not coming over here

25:21.320 --> 25:22.521
as a friend right now.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.856
I feel like
you're coming over here

25:23.856 --> 25:26.225
trying to stir the fucking pot,
and it's like--

25:26.225 --> 25:28.927
- Well, honey, coming up
to my job drunk...

25:28.927 --> 25:30.129
- Oh, here we go.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.965
- ...wasn't really being
a friend, either, babe.

25:32.965 --> 25:35.401
And when I texted you
months ago

25:35.401 --> 25:37.436
and you didn't answer me,

25:37.436 --> 25:39.738
that didn't really show me
that you cared, either.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.073
- Just in her tone of voice

25:41.073 --> 25:44.076
I can tell that she is trying
to get under my skin

25:44.076 --> 25:46.912
and psych me out, because
I guess she sees me as a threat.

25:46.912 --> 25:49.281
But now she's trying
to backpedal

25:49.281 --> 25:51.683
and say that this is
about our previous drama

25:51.683 --> 25:54.086
that happened
like six months ago.

25:54.086 --> 25:55.754
And it's like Gia,
stop trying to make this

25:55.754 --> 25:59.925
about something that literally
isn't even a thing.

25:59.925 --> 26:03.762
Honestly, that night
has been nothing in my life

26:03.762 --> 26:05.297
since that night.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.132
None of that was public.

26:07.132 --> 26:09.868
And I don't really understand
the whole point

26:09.868 --> 26:11.804
of bringing this in
in the workroom

26:11.804 --> 26:13.138
while we're getting ready.

26:13.138 --> 26:15.607
It seems opportunistic of you.

26:15.607 --> 26:17.910
- Call it what you want.
It is what it is.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.144
- Opportunistic.

26:19.144 --> 26:21.647
- Sure. Honey, I'm here
for an opportunity

26:21.647 --> 26:22.915
just like you are.

26:22.915 --> 26:26.485
- Yeah, well, some of us
don't have to, you know,

26:26.485 --> 26:28.687
force storylines to get airtime.

26:29.988 --> 26:33.091
- [laughs]
Cutthroat Farrah.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.927
- I was just trying to see,

26:34.927 --> 26:36.929
in case today's your last day
here in the competition,

26:36.929 --> 26:41.733
how you feel about
our friendship and our past.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.636
- You are taking up
my time right now,

26:44.636 --> 26:45.838
and I don't have time for it.

26:45.838 --> 26:47.473
- Because you can't multitask.

26:47.473 --> 26:50.008
- Sure, Gia, whatever
you want me to fucking say.

26:50.008 --> 26:51.143
- Can you not bully my teammate?

26:51.143 --> 26:52.444
- I'm not bullying her.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.679
- I'm saying, but she
just asked you to step away.

26:53.679 --> 26:55.447
- Literally, like,
just please get out of my face.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.682
- I'm not bullying her.
- Seriously, sister.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.450
She just said
she wants to get ready.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.320
- Gia, you know you're over here
trying to stir shit up,

27:01.320 --> 27:04.056
so, like, why don't you
go to your station

27:04.056 --> 27:05.524
and put your makeup on, girl?

27:05.524 --> 27:08.160
- Ooh, bitch, girl.
Farrah's clapping back.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.561
She's like leave me alone.

27:09.561 --> 27:10.929
She gonna get to cracking
her neck.

27:10.929 --> 27:12.364
I'm like, yes, Farrah,
let that bitch know.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.500
Leave you alone, girl.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.601
Bye.

27:15.601 --> 27:17.803
- Don't be so sensitive.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.505
- Sis, no one
was being sensitive.

27:19.505 --> 27:20.873
You literally went over there,

27:20.873 --> 27:22.674
and you was trying
to gas her up.

27:22.674 --> 27:23.909
Now I catch your game,

27:23.909 --> 27:25.410
and you're trying
in get my teammate's head.

27:25.410 --> 27:26.411
No, ma'am.

27:26.411 --> 27:27.713
If that was your girl

27:27.713 --> 27:29.548
and you was really concerned
about that friendship,

27:29.548 --> 27:31.016
why didn't you address that
day one?

27:31.016 --> 27:33.418
- Because it's taken a while
for things to boil up.

27:33.418 --> 27:34.686
- No, you--

27:34.686 --> 27:38.090
No, you found an opportunity.

27:38.090 --> 27:42.594
- I like Gia, and I see
some of myself in her.

27:42.594 --> 27:45.197
But, girl, don't pick on
the weakest one.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.932
If you go to prison,

27:46.932 --> 27:50.269
on the first day,
you don't shank the weakest one.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.504
You have to shank the biggest
guy to show your dominance.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.872
That just makes you
look like a bully.

27:53.872 --> 27:55.607
Trust me, I tried that
on my season.

27:55.607 --> 27:56.675
It doesn't work out.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.243
- Just in case
it's her last time here,

27:58.243 --> 27:59.945
I wanted to make sure--
- Oh, my gosh, sis!

27:59.945 --> 28:02.748
That is fake-as-fuck.com.

28:02.748 --> 28:05.183
- Call me what you want.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.352
- America,
Gia is fake as fuck.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.055
- Thank you, Monique,
for sticking up for me.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.423
- Farrah, I hope
that this, like,

28:11.423 --> 28:13.692
lights a fire under your ass.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.327
- Baby, this is a competition.

28:15.327 --> 28:18.597
If you can't take the pressure
of your other competitors,

28:18.597 --> 28:20.198
then you don't deserve
to be here.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.067
Get into it or get out.

Her colors are blush,
but she ain't bashful.

34:41.880 --> 34:42.914
- Mm-mm.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.049

that's new.

Clearly she plays the slits.

I mean slots.

She is serving
Sheryl Lee Ralph eleganza.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.786

in my right shoulder.

38:11.489 --> 38:13.992

38:13.992 --> 38:16.895

I feel elegant,

the judges fashion, girl.

38:19.564 --> 38:20.665
And I smell good, too.

38:20.665 --> 38:22.967
- I don't bring my dress
to the red carpet.

38:22.967 --> 38:26.337
I bring the red carpet
on my dress.

38:26.337 --> 38:28.306
- You just wear it.

38:28.306 --> 38:32.043

runway presentations,

You are safe.

39:39.544 --> 39:42.113
Please step
to the back of the stage.

Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

39:49.153 --> 39:51.723
starting with Manila Luzon.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.992
That...getup.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.627
- Get into the armpits.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.595
- Did you stone those armpits?

39:57.595 --> 39:58.863
[all laugh]

39:58.863 --> 40:02.000
- On the runway,
you looked stunning.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.102
This is what I expect,
and nothing less.

40:04.102 --> 40:06.070
But when it came
to your performance,

40:06.070 --> 40:09.908
almost everything on you
was like little for you.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.309
It was like small hair,

40:11.309 --> 40:12.744
you had these
little wedgie shoes on,

40:12.744 --> 40:15.780
that I was like, Manila?
In a wedge?

40:15.780 --> 40:18.683
And I almost felt you
kind of not knowing the words.

40:18.683 --> 40:21.152
You're a performer.
That's what you do.

40:21.152 --> 40:24.222
So I want to see that in you,
and that's what I expect.

40:24.222 --> 40:28.126
- The performance I honestly
have a giant question mark by,

40:28.126 --> 40:30.028
because I don't feel like
your intentions were super clear

40:30.028 --> 40:31.729
as to what you were
trying to get across.

40:31.729 --> 40:32.797
- Okay.

40:32.797 --> 40:34.465
- I can't pinpoint what it was.

40:34.465 --> 40:35.733
And maybe it's just that

40:35.733 --> 40:39.203
all the other queens
in your group were so good.

40:39.203 --> 40:43.241
- It really, really breaks my
heart that I came all this way

40:43.241 --> 40:46.978
and not just slay it
like I know I can.

40:46.978 --> 40:48.579
- So if you look in that mirror,

40:48.579 --> 40:50.782
if you're lucky enough
to survive, you know what to do.

40:52.750 --> 40:55.019
- Up next, Valentina.

40:55.019 --> 40:56.187
- Hola, Valentina.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.655
- Hola, mi amor.

40:57.655 --> 40:59.524
- Tonight on the runway
is very pretty,

40:59.524 --> 41:02.260
and your performance,
I loved most of all

41:02.260 --> 41:04.195
the nod to Selena, obviously.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.464
You had some Spanish
in your verse, which was lovely.

41:06.464 --> 41:09.467
It was fun, it was catchy,
and it was you.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.103
- Valentina, you gave me
Valentino vibes.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.538
That's how I look at your dress.

41:13.538 --> 41:15.640
I loved the energy,

41:15.640 --> 41:16.975
and I loved
when you hit the high note.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.643
Like, there was something
kind of like "I Love Lucy"

41:18.643 --> 41:20.044
about that ending.

41:20.044 --> 41:21.479
You brought it.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.915
- There's something very special
about you, Valentina.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.783
We saw it in your first season,

41:25.783 --> 41:28.219
and we are seeing it again
here in "All Stars."

41:29.220 --> 41:31.322
- Up next, Naomi Smalls.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.558
- You are a great songwriter.

41:33.558 --> 41:35.259
- Thank you.
- You are.

41:35.259 --> 41:36.894
Your verse
really stood out to me.

41:36.894 --> 41:38.229
- You were one of the few

41:38.229 --> 41:40.798
that actually just slayed
the hell out of your game.

41:40.798 --> 41:42.100
Loved what you were wearing.

41:42.100 --> 41:45.436
It was sassy,
it was fashion, it was hot.

41:45.436 --> 41:47.739
- I actually could see myself
rocking it on the stage.

41:47.739 --> 41:50.208
I was like, I gotta figure out
who made that.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.477
It was just lit in all ways.

41:52.477 --> 41:54.512
And you committed
and you were consistent

41:54.512 --> 41:56.247
from the performance
to the runway.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.850
- I printed out your words
to "1, 2 Step"

41:58.850 --> 42:00.651
so all my girlfriends
in sixth grade,

42:00.651 --> 42:02.053
we could memorize
all the lyrics.

42:02.053 --> 42:04.355
So this is fucking crazy.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.456
- Oh, thank you so much.

42:05.456 --> 42:07.425
- Up next, Monique Heart.

42:07.425 --> 42:08.793
- Hello, hello.

42:08.793 --> 42:11.696
- I loved
the kind of nod to TLC

42:11.696 --> 42:13.197
you were giving us
with your look.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.332
- I was doing Aaliyah.

42:14.332 --> 42:15.833
- Okay, Aaliyah.

42:15.833 --> 42:16.934
I just felt like it was

42:16.934 --> 42:18.002
full nineties
girl group moment.

42:18.002 --> 42:20.438
- Stunning.

42:20.438 --> 42:22.407
- But it got a little bit messy.

42:22.407 --> 42:25.343
- In a performance like that,
precision is key.

42:25.343 --> 42:26.944
Right? The words have
to be precise.

42:26.944 --> 42:28.613
The movements
have to be precise.

42:28.613 --> 42:31.215
And it just was a little messy.

42:31.215 --> 42:33.985
- I would say the coat
I can say was messy,

42:33.985 --> 42:35.086
but I was sweating.

42:35.086 --> 42:36.387
I'm a dude
trying to take it off.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.623
It got stuck.

42:38.623 --> 42:39.724
Get it?

42:39.724 --> 42:42.326
- Sometimes that happens,
but I will say,

42:42.326 --> 42:44.929
when the lights are on, as
performers and just for myself,

42:44.929 --> 42:46.531
we can't even make
an excuse for it.

42:46.531 --> 42:49.300
We just have to like be in
that moment and commit to it.

42:49.300 --> 42:50.968
And that's just the ownership
we have to have.

42:50.968 --> 42:53.471
- Up next, Farrah Moan.

42:53.471 --> 42:55.840
- Everything about your look
is perfection.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.375
Like, everything works
with each other.

42:57.375 --> 42:59.877
It complements each other.
Everything is just right.

42:59.877 --> 43:01.612
- So many women would kill
to look like that.

43:01.612 --> 43:02.947
- Oh, stop.

43:02.947 --> 43:04.882
- But the performance was,

43:04.882 --> 43:07.084
sorry, just like
a little bit white bread.

43:07.084 --> 43:11.155
- I think this is the first time
I've really seen you dance,

43:11.155 --> 43:14.959
and the whitest dancer
I've ever seen in my life

43:14.959 --> 43:16.828
is the nice way to put it.

43:16.828 --> 43:18.796
- Oh.

43:18.796 --> 43:21.799
- You are serving me
vegan dessert.

43:21.799 --> 43:23.334
Like they bring it to the table,
and it looks really good.

43:23.334 --> 43:25.503
And it tastes really good, too.

43:25.503 --> 43:28.272
- But it's not as fulfilling
as you want it to be.

43:28.272 --> 43:30.374
You have it.

43:30.374 --> 43:33.644
We're just seeing you
struggle to find it.

43:34.879 --> 43:38.082
- Up next, Monét X Change.

43:38.082 --> 43:41.152
- Tonight, you were my favorite
performer of all.

43:41.152 --> 43:42.420
You're actually
a really good rapper.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.454
- Thank you.

43:43.454 --> 43:44.956
- You were in the moment.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.257
You were grounded.

43:46.257 --> 43:48.526
- I really enjoyed
the performance, too.

43:48.526 --> 43:50.895
It was another memorable moment
for me for tonight as well.

43:50.895 --> 43:54.465
- But now let's talk about
this runway look.

43:55.466 --> 43:56.601
I love it.

43:56.601 --> 43:59.270
- I was thinking, damn, girl.
- [laughs]

43:59.270 --> 44:01.739
- This is a look that
you never would have served us

44:01.739 --> 44:04.041
on Season 10,
and look at you now.

44:04.041 --> 44:07.278
It's a joy to watch you
really hone your skills.

44:07.278 --> 44:08.546
- Thank you.

44:08.546 --> 44:11.282
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

44:11.282 --> 44:13.618
And I've made some decisions.

44:16.521 --> 44:18.589
- Monét X Change.

44:18.589 --> 44:21.158
Valentina.

44:21.158 --> 44:22.493
Con-drag-ulations.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.929
You are the top two All Stars
of the week.

44:24.929 --> 44:27.598
[applause]

44:27.598 --> 44:33.371
You've each won a $2.500
gift card from arda wigs,

44:33.371 --> 44:39.510
plus $1.000 gift card
from Coolhaus Ice Cream.

44:39.510 --> 44:42.346
Naomi Smalls, you are safe.

44:46.217 --> 44:47.618
Manila Luzon,

44:49.554 --> 44:50.988
You are safe.

44:52.557 --> 44:54.559
- Thank you.

44:54.559 --> 44:58.362
- That means Farrah Moan
and Monique Heart,

44:58.362 --> 45:01.632
you are in the bottom two.

45:01.632 --> 45:07.138
Monét, Valentina,
each of you needs to decide

45:07.138 --> 45:09.440
which of the bottom queens
you'll eliminate

45:09.440 --> 45:11.609
if you win the lip sync.

45:11.609 --> 45:16.047
So while you queens deliberate
in the workroom,

45:16.047 --> 45:19.817
the judges and I
will toss Ross's salad.

45:22.053 --> 45:23.754
Ladies,
you may leave the stage.

45:24.855 --> 45:27.358
- We have a winner!

45:27.358 --> 45:29.460
- ♪ Dee dee dee dee ♪

45:29.460 --> 45:30.995
- Oh.
- Congrats, mi vida.

45:30.995 --> 45:32.763
- Congrats to you, too.

45:32.763 --> 45:37.201
- I've now won
my first challenge.

45:37.201 --> 45:38.803
It's been an honor.
[applause]

45:38.803 --> 45:40.471
Thank you, thank you.

45:40.471 --> 45:42.740
But when you're in
this position,

45:42.740 --> 45:44.375
it makes you feel
all these feelings

45:44.375 --> 45:46.911
'cause you don't want
to have to send somebody home.

45:46.911 --> 45:50.114
I don't want to have to be like,
all right, I won, bitch, bye.

45:50.114 --> 45:51.148
No.

45:51.148 --> 45:52.783
- Congratulations, guys.

45:52.783 --> 45:54.285
- Yes.
- Cheers.

45:54.285 --> 45:55.786
- Thank you guys so much.

45:55.786 --> 45:58.589
- My first challenge win
in "Drag Race" history, girls.

45:58.589 --> 46:01.359
[cheering]
I never won any in my season.

46:01.359 --> 46:04.095
- But you're a winner, baby.
- Yay!

46:04.095 --> 46:05.663
- No, you're top two.

46:05.663 --> 46:08.699
- No, bitch,
I won a cash prize. I won.

46:08.699 --> 46:10.034
- Oh.

46:10.034 --> 46:13.971
- When can I plead my case,
because I need to stay,

46:13.971 --> 46:16.207
so at what point
does that happen?

46:16.207 --> 46:18.809
Can I plead my case with
one of y'all, because I cannot.

46:18.809 --> 46:20.811
America, I am so gooped
right now.

46:20.811 --> 46:23.781
Like how does a strong,
beautiful,

46:23.781 --> 46:27.618
talented,
fabulous queen like me,

46:27.618 --> 46:31.088
that was in the top last week,
be in the bottom?

46:31.088 --> 46:33.090
Was I really that bad?

46:33.090 --> 46:34.091
Can we talk?

46:34.091 --> 46:36.060
- I think we should
definitely talk.

46:36.060 --> 46:37.928
I would love
that opportunity.

46:37.928 --> 46:39.330
- But not right now?

46:39.330 --> 46:40.998
- Um, I don't know.

46:40.998 --> 46:42.867
I just wanted to share something
with you guys.

46:42.867 --> 46:44.435
- Oh, my God, yes.

46:45.936 --> 46:47.772
- Okay.

46:47.772 --> 46:50.074
- I feel so many emotions
right now.

46:50.074 --> 46:51.509
I should be celebrating,

46:51.509 --> 46:54.378
but at the same time,
I feel like, oh, my goodness,

46:54.378 --> 46:56.981
I have to focus on the lip sync.

46:56.981 --> 46:59.850
Valentina, you are not known
for knowing the words.

46:59.850 --> 47:01.285
- Girl, Valentina is a diva.

47:01.285 --> 47:05.489
She seriously thinks that she
is like this telenovela star.

47:05.489 --> 47:08.492
[Spanish guitar plays,
applause]

47:11.429 --> 47:13.998
- It's just so hard, girls.

47:13.998 --> 47:16.133
- Ugh.

47:16.133 --> 47:17.668
Are y'all gonna talk
to each other, or what?

47:17.668 --> 47:19.070
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:19.070 --> 47:21.772
- Y'all got
about 10 minutes, bitch.

47:21.772 --> 47:24.008
- The biggest issue
with being in the bottom

47:24.008 --> 47:26.644
is the fact that
you can't fight for you.

47:26.644 --> 47:28.779
You're in the ocean.

47:28.779 --> 47:30.214
You can't swim.

47:30.214 --> 47:31.649
You're by the boat,

47:31.649 --> 47:34.318
and you're waiting for them
to throw you a lifeline.

47:34.318 --> 47:36.654
That is the most
unsettling thing

47:36.654 --> 47:38.389
about this whole competition.

47:38.389 --> 47:40.725
I cannot go home.
Like, I cannot.

47:40.725 --> 47:42.159
I felt like to come back

47:42.159 --> 47:44.729
and come back as strong
as I came day one in the door,

47:44.729 --> 47:46.430
I think that speaks volumes.

47:46.430 --> 47:48.733
It was just messy
because of a coat.

47:48.733 --> 47:50.101
Fuck.

47:50.101 --> 47:51.769
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

47:51.769 --> 47:53.871
- If you can go back,
I wouldn't have worn the coat,

47:53.871 --> 47:57.074
but I was trying to give homage.

47:57.074 --> 48:00.010
- Monique is very defensive,

48:00.010 --> 48:02.713
but with her Aaliyah outfit,

48:02.713 --> 48:05.483
the fit of that pant
is not okay.

48:05.483 --> 48:08.185
That is so disrespectful
to Aaliyah.

48:08.185 --> 48:09.420
How dare you.

48:09.420 --> 48:10.921
I have to make a decision.

48:10.921 --> 48:12.323
- You do.

48:12.323 --> 48:14.191
- And ultimately, someone's
heart is going to be broken.

48:14.191 --> 48:15.459
- Very bad.

48:15.459 --> 48:16.861
I don't want you to pick me,

48:16.861 --> 48:21.332
but if you do, I would
have to swallow the bullet,

48:21.332 --> 48:22.833
and it's not personal.

48:22.833 --> 48:27.605
It's just what the game
has called for.

48:27.605 --> 48:28.939
Ouch.

48:28.939 --> 48:30.641
- I really am gagged
that you're in the bottom,

48:30.641 --> 48:32.877
because I felt like
our team as a whole--

48:32.877 --> 48:34.211
- Did so well.

48:34.211 --> 48:35.579
- I feel like
we were all so strong,

48:35.579 --> 48:36.747
and that you really went
balls to the wall.

48:36.747 --> 48:38.182
- Yeah.

48:38.182 --> 48:40.818
- Hold on. I just want to say
something to them real fast.

48:40.818 --> 48:42.787
Is that rude
for me to interrupt?

48:44.021 --> 48:45.456
I'm feeling
a little bit responsible

48:45.456 --> 48:47.458
for the way that things
played out today,

48:47.458 --> 48:49.860
and I just don't want that
weighing on my shoulder

48:49.860 --> 48:52.129
if she does get eliminated.

48:52.129 --> 48:53.330
- I'm kind of like
really holding in

48:53.330 --> 48:54.498
a lot of my emotions right now.

48:54.498 --> 48:56.133
- Ladies,
I don't want to interrupt,

48:56.133 --> 48:57.301
but I just want
to say something real fast.

48:57.301 --> 48:58.402
Is that okay?

49:00.204 --> 49:02.106
- This is Farrah's time.
- Yeah.

49:02.106 --> 49:03.974
Real fast, because
you were both on your team--

49:03.974 --> 49:05.943
on each other's team.

49:05.943 --> 49:08.512
I do sincerely want to apologize
to both of you

49:08.512 --> 49:14.218
if I created any type of stir-up
in anyone's emotions

49:14.218 --> 49:15.920
or anything like that.

49:15.920 --> 49:18.589
My intentions were not to throw
you off or throw your group off.

49:18.589 --> 49:21.392
- Gia, this is literally
not the time

49:21.392 --> 49:24.328
for your fake apology
to make yourself feel better.

49:26.931 --> 49:29.600
God, I can't stand her.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.602
- Gia Gunn can't stop talking.
Look at her.

49:31.602 --> 49:33.537
She's over there like buying up
Miss Farrah's time.

49:34.605 --> 49:35.773
- I would have put Gia
in the bottom.

49:35.773 --> 49:36.807
- Would you have?

49:36.807 --> 49:38.475
- Just for her attitude.

49:38.475 --> 49:40.377
Girl, it's time for her to go.

49:40.377 --> 49:41.512
- You know that
I treasure our friendship

49:41.512 --> 49:43.681
and regardless
after what happens today,

49:43.681 --> 49:46.517
I would really like for us
to work on our friendship,

49:46.517 --> 49:48.452
and that's all
that I wanted to say.

49:48.452 --> 49:50.487
I don't want to take
any more of your time, okay?

49:50.487 --> 49:51.555
Thank you.

49:54.024 --> 49:57.027
- Girl, here she comes.
Don't say nothing.

49:57.027 --> 49:58.596
- What did you
go over there for?

49:58.596 --> 49:59.697
- I know. What'd you say?

49:59.697 --> 50:00.998
- I just wanted to tell them--

50:00.998 --> 50:02.766
- Poke the bear.
- Huh?

50:02.766 --> 50:04.802
- Poke the little Care Bear.
- No, no, no, no.

50:04.802 --> 50:09.273
I feel like when
you make a mistake in life,

50:09.273 --> 50:11.742
it's okay to apologize and
let people know how you feel,

50:11.742 --> 50:13.510
in case this is the last time

50:13.510 --> 50:16.447
that I do get to talk to her
before elimination.

50:16.447 --> 50:17.781
That you know what, girl?

50:17.781 --> 50:20.017
I'm sorry if I fucked
y'all's juj up.

50:20.017 --> 50:25.089
- Gia is here
stirring the pot again.

50:25.089 --> 50:26.257
Is that all she does?

50:26.257 --> 50:29.526
'Cause if that was a talent,
girl, you win.

50:29.526 --> 50:31.328
- Girl, I'm just like, what?

50:31.328 --> 50:33.130
You know, I thought
they were gonna get it.

50:33.130 --> 50:34.365
I thought
they were gonna like it.

50:34.365 --> 50:36.934
I thought all the boxes
were checked.

50:36.934 --> 50:39.370
I cannot go home.
Don't send me home.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.238
I don't want to go home.

50:41.238 --> 50:43.307
I have worked too hard
to get back.

50:43.307 --> 50:45.809
It took too much to bounce back.

50:45.809 --> 50:48.679
- Yeah, yeah.
- But I'm not done at all.

50:48.679 --> 50:51.649
- Yeah.
- Miss Monét, that's my sis.

50:51.649 --> 50:53.684
And I hope she would save me.

50:53.684 --> 50:55.586
That's my mindset,
that is my game plan,

50:55.586 --> 50:56.654
that's where I'm at.

50:56.654 --> 50:58.789
- I love you.
- I love you.

50:58.789 --> 51:00.324
- You know I love you, too,
mama.

51:00.324 --> 51:02.159
Now I'm going to go
and change for this lip sync.

51:02.159 --> 51:05.663
- Yeah, I need you to win.
- [laughs]

51:05.663 --> 51:07.364
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

51:07.364 --> 51:08.532
- I'm sorry that
you're in the bottom.

51:08.532 --> 51:10.935
I could only imagine
how much you're feeling.

51:10.935 --> 51:13.237
- Honestly, it really sucks,
Valentina,

51:13.237 --> 51:16.907
because I came here
to prove something to myself.

51:16.907 --> 51:20.177
And I think you know
deep down in your heart

51:20.177 --> 51:26.450
that I am a bigger star
than going home right now.

51:26.450 --> 51:30.087
- But if I was to eliminate you,

51:30.087 --> 51:34.124
what would that do
to everything that we've built?

51:34.124 --> 51:36.527
We've worked so hard
on this relationship, Valentina.

51:36.527 --> 51:39.396
It's like we've finally got
to such a good place.

51:39.396 --> 51:41.098
And, I mean,
it would be heartbreaking.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.400
I want this

51:43.400 --> 51:46.971
more than I've wanted anything
in my whole life.

51:46.971 --> 51:48.372
If I go home tonight,

51:48.372 --> 51:53.110
it's going to take me a really
long time to get over it.

51:53.110 --> 51:55.713
- I just fixed my relationship
with Farrah.

51:55.713 --> 51:57.581
She apologized
about all the stuff

51:57.581 --> 51:59.516
that happened at the reunion,

51:59.516 --> 52:00.784
and we were able
to move forward.

52:00.784 --> 52:03.120
And now we're excited
to be here together.

52:03.120 --> 52:06.657
So I don't really want
to go there and do that to her.

52:06.657 --> 52:08.392
- I love you so much, Valentina.

52:08.392 --> 52:09.860
- I love you, too.

52:09.860 --> 52:11.629
I really do, okay?

52:11.629 --> 52:13.230
- I can't wait
to watch your lip sync.

52:13.230 --> 52:16.066
Don't let the stress
of this decision

52:16.066 --> 52:18.802
affect your moment right now,
because, Valentina,

52:18.802 --> 52:22.206
this is exactly
what you came here to do.

52:22.206 --> 52:24.141
[laughs]
- Thanks, mi amor.

52:28.479 --> 52:29.546
- Sending someone home

52:29.546 --> 52:30.914
is harder than
I thought it would be.

52:32.149 --> 52:34.785
My Miss Congeniality
crown, girl,

52:34.785 --> 52:36.020
is gonna be a little tarnished.

52:36.020 --> 52:37.521
It's gonna be a little tainted

52:37.521 --> 52:39.857
because someone's dreams
are on a lipstick

52:39.857 --> 52:42.026
underneath my sweaty sock boob.

52:42.026 --> 52:44.495
That ain't congenial.

52:45.629 --> 52:48.465
- This decision sets the tone

52:48.465 --> 52:52.436
about who I am
and what I'm here to do.

52:52.436 --> 52:55.672
There's going to be
so many opinions

52:55.672 --> 52:59.009
about why I decided that person.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.745
Are you threatened?
Are you jealous?

53:01.745 --> 53:05.315
Or are you mean?
Are you empty?

53:05.315 --> 53:09.853
Their entire future
is in your hand,

53:09.853 --> 53:13.090
and it's up to you
to cut it short.

53:13.090 --> 53:14.525
To go, whoosh.

53:14.525 --> 53:15.592
Bye, girl.

53:15.592 --> 53:20.164
Adiós, mi amor.

53:20.164 --> 53:22.099
But that's the game.

53:28.605 --> 53:29.773
- Welcome back, ladies.

53:29.773 --> 53:33.610
Two top All Stars
stand before me.

53:33.610 --> 53:34.878
Prior to tonight,

53:34.878 --> 53:38.048
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

53:38.048 --> 53:41.251
of "Into You" by Ariana Grande.

53:41.251 --> 53:44.521
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

53:44.521 --> 53:48.959
win $10.000,
and earn the power

53:48.959 --> 53:52.362
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

53:54.731 --> 53:56.900
The time has come...
[thunder]

53:56.900 --> 53:59.002
for you to lip sync...

53:59.002 --> 54:02.339
[echoing] for your legacy.

54:03.841 --> 54:06.610
- I now have the opportunity

54:06.610 --> 54:11.181
to completely redeem myself
with an Ariana Grande song.

54:11.181 --> 54:15.385
And if I fuck this one again,
it's over, girl.

54:15.385 --> 54:20.591
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

for me in my life.

the proof in the pudding

56:53.443 --> 56:55.078

You've earned a cash tip

Valentina, with great power
comes great responsibility.

57:26.777 --> 57:31.148
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

57:31.148 --> 57:34.951
- I made this decision
confidently tonight,

57:34.951 --> 57:36.486
but with a broken heart

57:36.486 --> 57:41.558
strictly because
the person I'm eliminating

57:41.558 --> 57:45.028
had the opportunity
to prove themselves,

57:45.028 --> 57:46.863
and it simply wasn't enough.

And I hope
this is not the end of us...

57:54.271 --> 57:56.073
Farrah Moan.

57:58.408 --> 58:01.445
Farrah, I'm so sorry,
mi amor.

58:01.445 --> 58:02.779
- It's okay, baby.

58:02.779 --> 58:05.048
You don't love me.

58:05.048 --> 58:06.450
[laughs]

58:07.451 --> 58:08.452
- I do.

58:08.452 --> 58:11.021
- I'm just kidding, baby.

58:11.021 --> 58:16.326
- Farrah Moan, as it is written,
so it shall be done.

58:16.326 --> 58:21.064
You are and will always be
an All Star.

58:21.064 --> 58:22.999

for this opportunity,

58:22.999 --> 58:26.169

Bye, guys.

58:47.991 --> 58:49.726
I really didn't think

58:49.726 --> 58:52.162
that Valentina
was going to send me home.

58:52.162 --> 58:55.832
This competition
meant so much to me.

58:55.832 --> 58:58.335
And I really wanted
to prove to myself

58:58.335 --> 59:00.437
that I could do it,

59:00.437 --> 59:02.939
and I'm so disappointed
in myself.

59:02.939 --> 59:06.643
But at the end of the day--
fuck--

59:06.643 --> 59:09.279
don't let anybody
tell you ever

59:09.279 --> 59:11.214
that you're not worth it.

Fuck!

59:14.885 --> 59:17.487
Con-drag-ulations, All Stars.

59:17.487 --> 59:20.090
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

59:20.090 --> 59:21.958
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

59:21.958 --> 59:23.760
Can I get an amen up in here?

59:23.760 --> 59:25.595
- Amen.

we are playing
the Snatch Game of Love.
