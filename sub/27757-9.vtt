WEBVTT

00:09.335 --> 00:11.835
Speed:
Let's, uh, jump on in
now, folks.

00:11.919 --> 00:14.585
I love starting the walking
tour standing still,

00:14.669 --> 00:18.418
because this way we're our own
natural, organic Greek chorus,

00:18.502 --> 00:21.502
walking around our own
unfolding Greek drama.

00:21.585 --> 00:23.001
And just like any Greek chorus

00:23.085 --> 00:25.460
in relationship
to its unfolding plot,

00:25.543 --> 00:28.502
we'll be participating,
observing, commenting,

00:28.585 --> 00:32.043
but never really committing,
if you know what I mean.

00:32.126 --> 00:34.502
As, most importantly,
the walking tour is designed

00:34.585 --> 00:36.210
to be an intimate soirée

00:36.293 --> 00:38.627
that waltzes across
this vast alienation--

00:38.710 --> 00:42.669
Hey, people are
trying to get to work,
you dumb motherfuckers!

00:42.752 --> 00:44.168
Welcome!

00:44.251 --> 00:47.418
Let's charge off now into
the great random choreography

00:47.502 --> 00:49.377
that appears five times a week:

00:49.460 --> 00:50.877
rush hour,

00:50.960 --> 00:53.543
starring neurosis,
the mediocre psychedelic trip

00:53.627 --> 00:55.001
guiding all of this.

00:55.085 --> 00:57.335
Off to your right, Central Park.

Don't you say that to me!
Don't you ever say that to me!

01:45.877 --> 01:48.418
You know, you may be able to get
away with that with the old man,

01:48.502 --> 01:49.877
get him tanked up for a week,

01:49.960 --> 01:52.085
buy him off with
your Hollywood blood money,

01:52.168 --> 01:53.960

-It was just an offer.

so much for coming.

As you know, this is
our first-ever New York
agent showcase,

02:53.126 --> 02:56.585
and the kids are so darned
excited to meet you.

02:56.669 --> 02:58.669
Thank you so much for coming

02:58.752 --> 03:00.835
and making their
dreams come true.

03:00.919 --> 03:03.877
Uh, and now
the great work begins.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.043
Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry.
Uh, okay, I'm--

03:06.126 --> 03:08.627
I-- I'll just collect
your-- your forms,

03:08.710 --> 03:12.585
uh, that you filled out, and
if you didn't, please do, uh...

03:12.669 --> 03:15.669
Thank you so much.
I'm Leonard Tully, as I said,

03:15.752 --> 03:17.669
and my picture and resume's
not in your packet,

03:17.752 --> 03:20.251
but I've got a stack of them
backstage if anybody wants one.

03:20.335 --> 03:22.001
-Thanks.
-(laughing): I'm kidding.

03:22.085 --> 03:23.835
Oh. hi. Hi, hi, hi, hi.

03:23.919 --> 03:25.669
Don't go, I wanna sit
and talk to you.

03:25.752 --> 03:26.960
(whispering):
Okay, I'll see you back there.

03:27.043 --> 03:29.001
I'm gonna hang on
to mine, thanks.

03:29.085 --> 03:31.293
Okay. Thanks for coming.

03:33.627 --> 03:35.752
-So good, so good.
-Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

03:35.835 --> 03:37.794
Thanks, thanks. They-- Listen,
you gotta go out and mingle

03:37.877 --> 03:39.669
-'cause they're dying
to meet a real live actor.
-Okay, okay.

03:39.752 --> 03:40.835
Told 'em all about you.

03:40.919 --> 03:42.669
Curtis:
I'm telling you,
all you need

03:42.752 --> 03:44.877
is a couple of good knives
and a big pot

03:44.960 --> 03:46.752
so you can make soup
for the whole week.

03:46.835 --> 03:49.210
-What about getting an agent?
-Oh, that'll happen
when it happens.

03:49.293 --> 03:50.835
But in the meantime,
you better get yourself

03:50.919 --> 03:52.210
a roommate
and get into soup!

03:52.293 --> 03:53.585
Of course, there's lots
of wine, yeah.

03:53.669 --> 03:56.210
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Janelle, Janelle, Janelle!

03:56.293 --> 03:58.543
Oh, thank you so much
for coming!

03:58.627 --> 04:00.877
Yeah, it's so--
it's so great to see you!

04:00.960 --> 04:02.669
-Yeah, it's great
to see you, too!
-Thank you.

04:02.752 --> 04:05.210
-Thank you so much
for inviting me.
-Of course, of course!

04:05.293 --> 04:07.085
Listen, do you have any tips

04:07.168 --> 04:09.251
or thoughts I should
pass along to them?

04:09.335 --> 04:13.168
Uh, um... Oh,
I loved that song
from Dear Evan Hansen.

04:13.251 --> 04:14.794
Oh, my God, it's so good.

04:14.877 --> 04:16.418
Actually, I've got to get
back to the office.

04:16.502 --> 04:19.543
-Oh.
-It really was so great
to see you, Leonard!

04:19.627 --> 04:21.418
-Thank you.
-I'll let you know
if there's interest,

04:21.502 --> 04:24.126
but, you know, we're boutique,
so we can only take on so many.

04:24.210 --> 04:27.168
Of course, of course.
Look, I know how
show business works.

04:27.251 --> 04:29.543
-Oh, whoa, whoa... Yeah.
-All right, take your call.

04:29.627 --> 04:32.919
-Thanks for coming.
It's great. So much love. Bye.
-Yeah. Yeah. Bye.

04:33.001 --> 04:34.669
What did she say?

04:34.752 --> 04:36.210
Does she want to meet
any of us or--?

04:36.293 --> 04:38.085
Well, here's the thing--
here's the thing about agents

04:38.168 --> 04:39.585
is that they work in a clump,

04:39.669 --> 04:41.585
-and so--
-Leonard, do we get
to see our sheets?

04:41.669 --> 04:44.251
Well, you know, guys, I want
you to meet my friend Curtis.

04:44.335 --> 04:46.418
We did Angels  together
at the Old Globe.

04:46.502 --> 04:49.251
He has amazing stories,
and he'll be able
to really tell you

04:49.335 --> 04:51.335
some things that I can't.
Just listen and learn.

04:51.418 --> 04:53.960
And if they want
you in a cock sock,
you wear a cock sock.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.877
And there ain't nothing
you can do about it.
Hopefully, it's the right size.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.543
I didn't even see
you here, girl.

04:58.627 --> 05:00.835
Now, let me tell you right now,
look at these freckles.

05:00.919 --> 05:02.502
You let people see
them freckles, because it's

05:02.585 --> 05:04.251
what makes you different,
it's what makes you good.

05:04.335 --> 05:06.001
Leonard:
What the hell is this?

05:06.085 --> 05:08.418
-Do you know
what NVS means?
-Curtis: What's the context?

05:08.502 --> 05:11.335
Leonard:
It's what some of the agents
wrote on the kids' forms.

05:11.418 --> 05:16.585
NVS or NVG next
to everybody's name
except Sunny's.

05:16.669 --> 05:20.502
Well, I don't know.
It's "New Verging Singer,"
"Now Very Strong,"

05:20.585 --> 05:22.377
"Nubile Versatile
Songstress."

05:22.460 --> 05:26.377
-Or, uh, "Nice
Vertical Stance." Yeah.
-Yeah, something like that.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.543
-Cyclist: Heads up!
-Really? Dumb motherfucker!

05:28.627 --> 05:32.794
(laughing):
Wow! Oh, it is so great
to be back in New York!

05:32.877 --> 05:35.752
God, I haven't been here
since the Pleistocene Age.

05:35.835 --> 05:39.502
Every goddamn break I had,
I had to go to Alex's family.

05:39.585 --> 05:42.835
-Oh, how is Alex?
-(sighs) Curtis!

05:42.919 --> 05:45.293
We broke up! I told you
all about it on Facebook.

05:45.377 --> 05:47.001
No, no, no. You know
I don't go on that shit.

05:47.085 --> 05:50.377
Well, it's been
about eight months.
It's been really rough.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.502
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah.

05:52.585 --> 05:54.627
But, you know, everything's
for a reason and the timing

05:54.710 --> 05:57.835
couldn't be better because
my sabbatical's coming up

05:57.919 --> 06:01.585
and, you know, New York's
always been my white whale.

06:01.669 --> 06:04.960
And so I'm thinking maybe now's
the time to dust off my Capezios

06:05.043 --> 06:08.460
and the 16 bars
and press some flesh
in the Equity Lounge

06:08.543 --> 06:13.001
and see if there
are any parts for
200-year-old men.

06:19.794 --> 06:21.627
Don:
This boy comes wobblin'

06:21.710 --> 06:24.126
down the street,
and I say to him,

06:24.210 --> 06:26.877
"Hey now,
what's all the fuss?"

06:26.960 --> 06:29.210
-(phone chimes)
-And now he says to me,

06:29.293 --> 06:31.835
he's looking
for a hospital,
can I help him?

06:31.919 --> 06:37.126
And so I say,
there hasn't been a hospital
around here in 20 years.

06:37.210 --> 06:40.210
-Yeah.
-But then, of course,
that Urgent Care

06:40.293 --> 06:42.835
is like a hospital,

06:42.919 --> 06:46.502
and that's just
two blocks away,
you know.

06:46.585 --> 06:49.293
I told him so.

06:49.377 --> 06:52.001
Always wondered what
happened to that boy.

06:53.126 --> 06:54.835
-Yeah, I do too.
-Mm.

06:54.919 --> 06:56.752
Uh, I don't wanna change
the subject or anything,

06:56.835 --> 06:59.794
but do you think this is
gonna be an expensive fix?

06:59.877 --> 07:02.585
And if it is,
do you think
you'll be able

07:02.669 --> 07:05.627
to take it off my hands
if it's fucked?

07:05.710 --> 07:07.919
(sighing):
Oh. Uh...

07:08.001 --> 07:11.168
-We'll see
about the engine.
-Okay.

07:11.251 --> 07:14.877
The rest seems to be
in good shape.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.251
You should keep it.

07:17.335 --> 07:20.293
I don't know, man.
It's pretty high-maintenance.

07:20.377 --> 07:22.335
(phone chiming)

07:22.418 --> 07:25.543
Uh, okay,
I'll look at it.

07:25.627 --> 07:27.043
Okay.

07:27.126 --> 07:29.001
Yeah.

07:33.794 --> 07:37.001
You wouldn't want a bag
of sand, would you?

07:38.543 --> 07:39.418
No.

08:02.627 --> 08:05.251
No, that's what
NVS stands for.

08:05.335 --> 08:08.126
You still thinking
about that? Let it go.

08:08.210 --> 08:11.752
Curtis, you once told me you
didn't need talent to make it,

08:11.835 --> 08:16.126
that if you were persistent
and everybody would leave

08:16.210 --> 08:18.752
and then you'd get all the parts
'cause there'd be nobody left.

08:18.835 --> 08:21.627
-I said that?
-Yeah, and it
worked out for you.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.669
If you're gonna talk,
go to the bar.

08:23.752 --> 08:25.502
Plenty of people want
to sing at the piano.

08:25.585 --> 08:27.085
I'm not gonna leave
till you play my song.

08:27.168 --> 08:29.001
Okay, take it easy,
Blanche.

08:29.085 --> 08:30.669

this fucking place.

08:30.752 --> 08:34.335

as well as these guys can.

08:34.418 --> 08:36.835
-Of course you can.
-Why am I not here?

08:36.919 --> 08:38.502
Because you're shaping
young minds.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.919

people singing.

-Curtis: Well,
I think that's my cue.

08:55.877 --> 08:57.710
-What?
-You know, I've
got a 4 a.m. call

08:57.794 --> 08:59.669
to be a forensic scientist
at Silvercup.

08:59.752 --> 09:01.543
Oh, you need somebody
to run lines?

09:01.627 --> 09:04.460
No. Blah-blah-blah. Contusion.
Looks like they were murdered.

09:04.543 --> 09:07.251
-It doesn't matter.
-Oh, hey, I love you so much!

09:07.335 --> 09:09.460
-I love you, too.
-Thank you so much for coming.

09:09.543 --> 09:11.919

we're still friends!

-Okay.

09:14.335 --> 09:16.293
-Okay? Okay.
-Yeah, I'd love that.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.418
Hi.

10:33.001 --> 10:34.835
Hi.

10:50.293 --> 10:51.877
That smells good.

10:55.126 --> 10:58.335
-You want?
-Yes, please.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.960
Danke schoen.

11:02.043 --> 11:04.919
Bitte schoen.
Sie sprechen?

11:05.001 --> 11:07.710
Sie sprechen Deutsch?

11:07.794 --> 11:13.669
No, but they were singing
a lot of Cabaret  across
the street.

11:13.752 --> 11:17.001
-Oh, I love Cabaret  .
-Yeah.

11:17.085 --> 11:22.126
(as Emcee):
"You wouldn't know that
she was Jewish at all."

11:22.210 --> 11:25.418
-That place seems fun.
I've never been there.
-Yeah.

11:25.502 --> 11:27.251
What are you doing tonight?

11:27.335 --> 11:29.126
Just went to see
a movie at IFC,

11:29.210 --> 11:31.502
now I'm going
on a bike ride,

11:31.585 --> 11:35.335
and, uh, probably
gonna go home soon.

11:35.418 --> 11:37.418
Sounds fun.

11:37.502 --> 11:39.418
It's pretty fun.
What about you?

11:39.502 --> 11:42.502
-(coughing)
-Oh shit.

11:42.585 --> 11:45.585
Here you go.
You okay?

11:45.669 --> 11:47.377
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm good.

11:47.460 --> 11:52.210
-Want some water?
-No. You want some ice cream?

11:52.293 --> 11:54.168
No, thank you.

11:55.835 --> 11:57.752
Oh shit.

11:57.835 --> 12:00.460
No one gets ice cream
now, I guess.

12:02.418 --> 12:04.126
What are you
doing tonight?

12:04.210 --> 12:06.085
You asked that.

12:07.210 --> 12:09.418
Oh, you okay?

12:09.502 --> 12:11.251
-Shit.
-(retching)

12:11.335 --> 12:13.543
-(breathing heavily)
-(moaning on phone)

12:13.627 --> 12:15.460
Oh shit.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.126
Oh God.

12:24.502 --> 12:27.502
Oh, oh.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.710
(panting)

12:31.794 --> 12:32.960
Ow!

12:33.043 --> 12:35.168
(distant siren wails)

12:41.168 --> 12:43.502
(groaning)

12:45.418 --> 12:47.543
-(clattering)
-Aah!

12:47.627 --> 12:49.335
(groans)

12:50.335 --> 12:52.794
Oh God.

12:58.669 --> 13:01.960
Oh my God.
Oh my God. Oh my God.

13:03.460 --> 13:05.752
Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit.

13:05.835 --> 13:07.669
(gasping)

13:07.752 --> 13:11.293
Oh! Aah! (panting)

13:11.377 --> 13:13.919
(whispering):
Oh my God. Oh my God.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.251
Help me, somebody.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.919
-Man: Hello?
-No, no, no, no!

13:26.001 --> 13:29.168
Don't come out. Stay asleep.

13:29.251 --> 13:33.126
Oh, Marta! Marta,
Marta, Marta!

13:33.210 --> 13:35.960
Are you there?
It's Leonard! Marta!

13:36.043 --> 13:38.877
-Did the agents call?
-No, no, no! Don't come
out yet, I'm naked!

13:38.960 --> 13:42.168
-Do you have a...
towel or something?
-Oh. All right.

13:42.251 --> 13:43.960
Don't come out, I'm naked.

13:44.043 --> 13:46.794
-Marta: Okay.
-Oh my God!
Don't look at me!

13:46.877 --> 13:48.710
(elevator dings)

13:48.794 --> 13:51.043
(soft jazz piano playing
in the background)

13:55.418 --> 13:57.835
(muffled):
Hello, uh, I'm sorry
to bother you.

13:57.919 --> 14:00.752
Could I get another
key for 504?

14:00.835 --> 14:03.877
-And, uh, do you
have any Advil?
-(elevator dings)

14:03.960 --> 14:06.043
Concierge:
Sure, let me check.

14:06.126 --> 14:07.543
Sorry.

14:11.460 --> 14:15.919
Speed:
A city is what happens once
a landscape needs to order in.

14:16.001 --> 14:18.502
New York City, great example.
The Collect Pond is

14:18.585 --> 14:21.794
the original drinking water
downtown. It gets polluted,

14:21.877 --> 14:23.752
they build a canal
to siphon off

14:23.835 --> 14:26.251
the polluted water into
the river: Canal Street.

14:26.335 --> 14:29.210
Then comes the invention
of private water companies

14:29.293 --> 14:32.335
that specialize in
bringing drinkable water

14:32.418 --> 14:33.835
to the population.

14:33.919 --> 14:37.085
And that right there,
that's when it becomes
New York City.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.669
Yeah, baby!

14:38.752 --> 14:41.126
For this city,
from its very beginnings

14:41.210 --> 14:45.210
has been a gigantic
ordering-in situation.

14:45.293 --> 14:46.919
(vehicles honking)

14:47.001 --> 14:48.543
As the different
honks of the city

14:48.627 --> 14:50.460
come blaring into
your present tense,

14:50.543 --> 14:52.835
connoisseur taste
and judge them based on

14:52.919 --> 14:56.960
their voluminousness, intensity,
context, and duration.

14:57.043 --> 14:58.794
That last little one,
did you hear that?

14:58.877 --> 15:01.210
Kind of a staccato chord
in the middle of that?

15:01.293 --> 15:03.585
That's the sound of
misguided animosity.

15:03.669 --> 15:05.085
(barking)

15:05.168 --> 15:08.126
Right this way.
Great view of traffic.

15:08.210 --> 15:10.043
Traffic is spiritual.

15:10.126 --> 15:14.335
Traffic is the city teacher's
method of inflicting patience

15:14.418 --> 15:18.251
on a population clearly
addicted to impatience.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.460
(elevator dings)

15:21.543 --> 15:24.001
-(phone chimes)
-(chattering)

15:28.335 --> 15:31.168
(mutters)
Dude, come on.

16:04.627 --> 16:08.502
Excuse me, I'm here to see
a couple of friends of mine:

16:08.585 --> 16:11.293
Bryan Gregory
and Sarah Rousso--

16:11.377 --> 16:15.710
I guess she's going
by Gregory now, actually,
too, so, yeah, uh, Gregory.

16:15.794 --> 16:17.835
And what's
the patient's name?

16:19.335 --> 16:20.377
Gregory.

16:22.168 --> 16:24.794
Oh, okay, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:24.877 --> 16:26.585
Um...

16:26.669 --> 16:28.377
Lo-- Logan. Logan.

16:28.460 --> 16:31.335
There you go. I just needed
to identify the patient.

16:31.418 --> 16:33.251
You know, I actually
haven't met him yet.

16:33.335 --> 16:35.251
They're friends from
high school and, uh--

16:35.335 --> 16:37.377
-Well, I hang out with-- yeah.
-(both laughing)

16:37.460 --> 16:40.043
-Where's the play room?
-The play room's down the hall.

16:40.126 --> 16:42.377
-Okay, thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.877
-Child: My stomach hurts.
-Woman: Stomach is hurting?

16:44.960 --> 16:48.377
-Yeah, really bad.
-Okay, okay. I'll let
them know, honey.

16:48.460 --> 16:51.085
-Where does it hurt?
Show me where it hurts.
-(whines): Here.

16:51.168 --> 16:55.335
-Okay. Is that helping
when you press on it?
-It hurts.

16:55.418 --> 16:59.460
Okay, sweetie, don't worry.
I was just out talking to him.

16:59.543 --> 17:00.710
He'll be right in.

17:00.794 --> 17:02.502
Sarah:
I don't know if everyone
wants to watch

17:02.585 --> 17:04.460
children dying of cancer on TV.

17:04.543 --> 17:06.168
Careworker:
I mean, hospital shows
are a thing.

17:06.251 --> 17:07.877
Sarah:
Really? I don't watch
that much TV, so--

17:07.960 --> 17:10.168
-Careworker:
Oh, yeah, they're a thing.
-Woman: Thank you.

17:10.251 --> 17:13.627
-Hi.
-(whispering): Hi.

17:15.669 --> 17:17.669
Hey there,
little cutie.

17:17.752 --> 17:20.001
-Hi. (chuckles)
-Hey.

17:20.085 --> 17:24.085
-Oh wow. Hey, little baby!
-(cooing): Hey! Hi!

17:24.168 --> 17:27.168
Don't worry, you're not
stuck with me alone,

17:27.251 --> 17:28.877
'cause Bryan's
on his way back.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.960
-I'm not stuck
with you.
-Okay.

17:31.043 --> 17:32.377
I'm very excited
to see you.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.710
-(laughing)
-Have you been
to New York before?

17:34.794 --> 17:36.585
Uh, no.
Uh, yeah, yeah.

17:36.669 --> 17:38.919
I don't know if you
remember our senior year,
I came with the choir.

17:39.001 --> 17:41.669
We saw some Broadway shows,
but you probably don't remember.

17:41.752 --> 17:44.001
Anyway, this is sort of
my first time as an adult.

17:44.085 --> 17:45.835
-Yeah, yeah.
-(laughing): Yeah.

17:45.919 --> 17:49.418
-I'll let you have a moment.
-Oh, sure. I'll see you
back in the room.

17:50.919 --> 17:52.460
(Sarah sighing)

17:53.669 --> 17:55.418
Hey, Logan.

17:56.919 --> 17:58.293
Hey.

18:02.001 --> 18:04.293
-Today was
really hard.
-Yeah?

18:04.377 --> 18:06.627
Yeah, he had immunotherapy,

18:06.710 --> 18:09.710
and he had to lie down
under this machine and...

18:12.835 --> 18:14.960
It was hard.
(chuckling)

18:17.001 --> 18:19.460
But, look.

18:19.543 --> 18:22.168
He has tattoos.

18:22.251 --> 18:23.585
-Oh, that's cool.
-Yeah.

18:23.669 --> 18:26.210
So they can line him up
with the radiation machine.

18:26.293 --> 18:33.335
-Hey! Cool party dots, bruh!
-Yeah! (chuckles)

18:40.669 --> 18:43.752
God, have you been outside
today? It's gorgeous.

18:43.835 --> 18:47.251
Yeah, I remember I got in
a huge fight with my parents,

18:47.335 --> 18:50.043
and I was at your house,
lying on your bed on my back,

18:50.126 --> 18:52.627
and I remember feeling
extremely self-conscious

18:52.710 --> 18:55.460
'cause I had braces on
and I was, like, crying
and snotting everywhere.

18:55.543 --> 18:57.502
-That's right.
-But I was just
looking at your wall,

18:57.585 --> 19:00.043
and there was a framed poster

19:00.126 --> 19:03.001
of Miss Saigon
and Les Miserables  and...

19:03.085 --> 19:05.919
- RENT  . Yep.
-...and then RENT  , yeah.

19:06.001 --> 19:08.710
-You don't
remember that?
-I do.

19:08.794 --> 19:12.335
You had neon green
rubber bands on your braces,

19:12.418 --> 19:14.335
-and there was a lot of snot.
-There was a lot of snot.

19:14.418 --> 19:16.418
-Yes.
-'Cause I'm a snotty
crier, still am.

19:16.502 --> 19:17.710
(laughing)

19:17.794 --> 19:19.919
(nearby siren blaring)

19:21.251 --> 19:24.043
Hey, I was thinking about it
on the ride over here...

19:25.377 --> 19:26.877
We were good friends.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.627
-We were best
friends, yeah.
-Yeah!

19:29.710 --> 19:31.502
Yeah.

19:31.585 --> 19:35.335
Whatever happened
to that friendship?

19:35.418 --> 19:37.627
Well...

19:37.710 --> 19:39.293
You and Bryan would always
do drugs together,

19:39.377 --> 19:41.085
and I didn't want
him to do that.

19:43.085 --> 19:44.585
Fair.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.919
You know, I remember
that I was giving you

19:48.001 --> 19:51.126
-a lot of shit for voting
for Bush the first time...
-Oh my Lord.

19:51.210 --> 19:54.835
-...'cause I couldn't vote yet,
and you were crazy.
-Yes, yes.

19:54.919 --> 19:57.835
And you were really
self-righteous and obnoxious

19:57.919 --> 19:59.835
-about Ralph Nader.
-Ralph Nader!

19:59.919 --> 20:01.669
'Cause he's got
some good ideas.

20:01.752 --> 20:05.126
-You were kind of an
asshole about it, actually.
-I was. That's fair too.

20:06.752 --> 20:08.085
Yeah.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.210
-Did your dad vote for--
-Yeah, of course he did.

20:13.293 --> 20:14.669
Yeah.

20:14.752 --> 20:17.085
-Did you?
-No, I didn't vote.

20:17.168 --> 20:19.794
Okay, okay.

20:26.543 --> 20:28.877
You know why I thought
you were pissed?

20:28.960 --> 20:31.085
-Why?
-The talent show.

20:31.168 --> 20:32.543
What?

20:32.627 --> 20:35.168
You were watching
the talent show,

20:35.251 --> 20:37.543
and you were standing
up front enjoying yourself,

20:37.627 --> 20:40.877
and I came up behind you and
you were wearing pajama pants,

20:40.960 --> 20:43.460
uh, and I pantsed you,
but I didn't know

20:43.543 --> 20:46.126
you weren't wearing
underwear and everyone saw.

20:46.210 --> 20:50.543
And I really felt bad
about it my entire life.

20:50.627 --> 20:52.043
What?

20:52.126 --> 20:53.752
-What are you laughing at?
-Are you kidding?

20:53.835 --> 20:56.043
I have no memory of that.

20:56.835 --> 20:58.502
-Really?
-No.

20:58.585 --> 21:00.377
You were so fucking pissed.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.377
Was I? I have
no recollection.

21:02.460 --> 21:05.335
-I've been sweating this
for like 20 years...
-(laughing)

21:05.418 --> 21:07.251
...and you're telling me--
Dude!

21:07.335 --> 21:08.877
You know, I might have
done a lot of drugs,

21:08.960 --> 21:11.001
-but you have
a really shitty memory.
-(baby fussing)

21:11.085 --> 21:13.919
Oh, oh, oh.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

21:14.001 --> 21:16.168
-Good morning.
-Yeah, hi.

21:16.251 --> 21:19.126
Aww, okay. Yeah?

21:20.669 --> 21:22.335
(phone chimes)

21:23.293 --> 21:26.835
Oh, Bryan's stuck
in traffic with the boys.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.251
He should be
here soon. Look.

21:29.335 --> 21:31.251
-(laughing):
They are so cute!
-The Guy: Aw.

21:31.335 --> 21:32.835
They have their
heads shaved!

21:32.919 --> 21:34.669
Oh yeah, in solidarity.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.835
Did... Did Bryan
shave his head?

21:38.335 --> 21:39.960
No?

21:40.043 --> 21:41.377
-Oh, insecure man.
-That's right.

21:41.460 --> 21:42.919
You gotta get
on the train, man.

21:43.001 --> 21:45.960
It's just people who come
here from all over the world

21:46.043 --> 21:48.085
to meet with this
one specialist.

21:48.168 --> 21:52.752
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, and everybody
is so gentle and quiet.

21:52.835 --> 21:54.293
It's actually
very, very nice.

21:54.377 --> 21:56.669
-I mean, I'm so glad
you guys found him.
-I know, right?

21:56.752 --> 21:59.669
-Bryan: Hey! Bruh!
-Sarah: Hi!

21:59.752 --> 22:01.043
-The Guy: Hey!
-What's up?

22:01.126 --> 22:02.835
-Good to see you, man!
-Nice to see you!

22:02.919 --> 22:04.919
Bryan:
How's it going?
Hey, Lo! Come here.

22:05.001 --> 22:07.126
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, hey!

22:07.210 --> 22:09.043
-Hey, Lo!
-Yeah.

22:09.126 --> 22:11.919
Hey, remember, we gotta
pick up that medicine from
the fridge to keep at Ronald.

22:12.001 --> 22:13.377
Oh yeah, got it.
I almost lost

22:13.460 --> 22:15.502
a bottle of medicine that
cost... (whispers): $10,000.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.001
-Yeah. A lot.
-Uh-oh.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.835
(laughing):
A lot. Yeah.

22:18.919 --> 22:20.585
Uh, listen, this was great.

22:20.669 --> 22:23.001
I really enjoyed getting to
hang out with this little bro.

22:23.085 --> 22:25.669
-Yeah, you meet
my friend here, Lo?
-Yeah.

22:25.752 --> 22:27.794
What do you think?
He still smell like pickles?

22:27.877 --> 22:30.919
-Bro, bro.
-(laughing): Sorry.

22:31.001 --> 22:33.210
-(laughing)
-A little bit?
A little bit?

22:33.293 --> 22:34.919
-All right, all right.
-Smells like pickles
a little bit?

22:35.001 --> 22:37.627
That is an open wound.
You can't just pour salt
like that.

22:37.710 --> 22:40.877
-I know, yeah.
-Listen, I want to help out.
Whatever I can do.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.794
We're gonna put the boys down
at Ronald and then we'll go out.

22:43.877 --> 22:45.335
'Cause I can also
come to Ronald.

22:45.418 --> 22:47.669
-It's not a problem
at all.
-Bro.

22:47.752 --> 22:49.210
-All right, well--
-We're gonna go out.

22:49.293 --> 22:50.502
You wanna get
something to eat?

22:50.585 --> 22:52.752
(all laughing)

22:52.835 --> 22:55.335
Payback! Sucka!

22:55.418 --> 22:57.627
Yeah, that was cool.
What'd you think of that, Logan?

22:57.710 --> 22:59.126
Oh, he liked it.

22:59.210 --> 23:00.502
-(laughing)
-Is this illegal?

23:00.585 --> 23:03.960
(bells tolling)

23:06.251 --> 23:07.835
Bruh.

23:07.919 --> 23:10.377
-Bruh.
-Bruh.

23:10.460 --> 23:12.710
-Marlboro Lights, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

23:12.794 --> 23:14.293
You used to smoke Camels.

23:16.335 --> 23:18.835
It's whatever.
I don't really care.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.502
Want some of this?

23:21.794 --> 23:25.126
-Cop's right there.
-Hospital's right there.

23:26.710 --> 23:28.335
So what do you
want to do, bruh?

23:29.752 --> 23:31.585
-Anything.
-(laughing)

23:31.669 --> 23:34.669
-You decide.
Whatever you want.
-All right.

23:34.752 --> 23:37.794
Wanna take a cab
or subway?

23:39.251 --> 23:41.001
None of the "abruhve."

23:41.085 --> 23:43.919
One for me,
one for you.

23:44.001 --> 23:46.585
-I don't have a bike.
-Oh, that's not
a problem, bruh.

23:50.919 --> 23:53.126
(both laughing)

23:58.752 --> 24:00.752
-Look at that!
-Whoa.

24:00.835 --> 24:03.627
That's SummerStage.
Free concerts.

24:03.710 --> 24:06.418
-(bikes rattling)
-Both: Whoa!

24:06.502 --> 24:09.460
-(voices vibrating)
-Oh, yeah, bruh.

24:12.168 --> 24:14.794
-(laughing)
-Oh!

24:16.835 --> 24:18.585
-Ah!
-I got it back.

24:18.669 --> 24:22.794
Oh, man, it feels like
a hundred miles an hour.

24:22.877 --> 24:25.502
It's one of the best
fucking feelings.

24:25.585 --> 24:28.043
It's really one of
the best feelings.

24:31.502 --> 24:33.877
-This is really nice, man.
-Yeah.

24:36.669 --> 24:39.085
Bryan:
Come on, bruh.
Bruh, bruh.

24:39.168 --> 24:40.543
Both:
Uh-oh.

24:41.543 --> 24:43.627
No, bruh.
The other way.

24:43.710 --> 24:44.960
(laughing)

24:45.043 --> 24:46.669
-(horns honking)
-Watch out.

24:46.752 --> 24:48.960
Bryan:
Almost hit a pothole.
(laughing)

24:49.043 --> 24:50.168
Speed:
And here we have members of

24:50.251 --> 24:52.126
every habitable continent
in the world

24:52.210 --> 24:55.919
taking photographs
of Central Perk from
the sitcom, Friends,

24:56.001 --> 24:59.960
another living art installation
in time, a complicated punchline

25:00.043 --> 25:03.543
spun by this complicated
comedian, New York City.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.418
One of the great recent
landmarks to land in
Greenwich Village,

25:06.502 --> 25:11.126
uh, the wonderful bondage
birdhouse up and right.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.335
Marie's Crisis Cafe
to your left,

25:13.418 --> 25:16.669
a bohemian restaurant with
live piano music since 1929.

25:16.752 --> 25:20.502
I cannot recommend
the sing-a-long enough.

25:28.585 --> 25:30.418
(boat horns blare)

25:31.251 --> 25:33.835
So the sun's that way.

25:33.919 --> 25:35.919
-I guess I fucked it up.
-Yeah.

25:36.001 --> 25:39.669
This is not a sunset, bruh.
It's all right.

25:39.752 --> 25:42.418
It's nice, it's nice.

25:50.835 --> 25:52.460
(phone bloops)

25:55.335 --> 25:56.960
Aah, shit.

25:58.293 --> 26:00.043
Sarah's freaking out.
I gotta go.

26:00.126 --> 26:03.168
-Oh, no!
-It's all right,
it's all right.

26:03.251 --> 26:05.043
-Thanks, man.
-If you need anything...

26:05.126 --> 26:06.752
No, I'm good.
Do you want your helmet?

26:06.835 --> 26:08.210
No, that's your, bro.

26:08.293 --> 26:10.210
-Good.
-It folds pancake-flat.

26:10.293 --> 26:11.919
Put it in your suitcase.

26:12.001 --> 26:14.210
I'm gonna need it. Probably get
hit by a car on the way home.

26:14.293 --> 26:17.335
Shut up, dude.
That's not funny.

26:17.418 --> 26:19.168
Bryan.

26:22.627 --> 26:25.919
Your family's beautiful.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.210
Thanks, man.

26:28.293 --> 26:30.585
You turned out
pretty good too, man.

26:30.669 --> 26:32.126
Maybe so.

26:34.835 --> 26:36.210
I love you.

26:37.335 --> 26:38.669
Bruh.

26:39.669 --> 26:41.418
I love you, too, bruh.

26:41.502 --> 26:44.126
-Thanks for the sunset.
-Yeah.

26:44.210 --> 26:46.168
-See ya, bruh.
-Later, bruh.

26:55.627 --> 26:57.835
(boat horn blares)

26:58.835 --> 27:00.377
(phone chimes)

27:22.543 --> 27:26.669
Speed:
I suppose if I had an essential
goal on the cruise right now,

27:26.752 --> 27:31.168
it would be to exhibit the fact
that I'm thrilled to be alive

27:31.251 --> 27:33.627
and to still be respected.

27:33.710 --> 27:37.794
I suppose the soulful or the
Buddhist out there might ask,

27:37.877 --> 27:39.794
"Why do you need
respect from others?

27:39.877 --> 27:42.460
"The thrill to be alive,
that's your own business.

27:42.543 --> 27:44.502
You can do that
in your living room."

27:44.585 --> 27:48.126
But that's not what
the cruise is for me.

27:48.210 --> 27:49.919
The cruise is
about the searching

27:50.001 --> 27:52.460
for everything
worthwhile in existence.

27:54.001 --> 27:57.293
I mean, I will appreciate
the beauty of a flower,

27:57.377 --> 28:00.543
and then likewise,
I will stand exhibitionistic

28:00.627 --> 28:03.210
and have the flower appreciate
the beauty of me.

28:03.293 --> 28:06.460
Well, that's how I feel
about cruising right now.

28:06.543 --> 28:09.168
And I would say
having a quote, unquote,

28:09.251 --> 28:12.043
"intimate love affair"
with a flower

28:12.126 --> 28:14.627
is far more psychotic
and riveting

28:14.710 --> 28:17.669
than having an "intimate love
affair," quote, unquote,

28:17.752 --> 28:21.835
with some of the banal
creatures of the human race.

28:21.919 --> 28:24.377
Although,
I'd be into that, too.

28:27.085 --> 28:28.752
