Morning, babe.Hey, babe.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.303
How's the sun victim?

00:42.346 --> 00:43.521
[chuckles]:
Oh.

00:43.565 --> 00:46.568
I keep forgetting
it's there and then...

00:46.611 --> 00:50.137
I look in the mirror and
scare myself half to death.

00:50.180 --> 00:51.616
[chuckles]:
I guess none of us

00:51.660 --> 00:53.531
got enough SPF
when we were kids.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.707
You should use that
for your campaign.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.448
I just might.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.494
How's the world looking?

Oh, you know. Droughts.

01:02.453 --> 01:05.674
Sectarian violence.
Mutating bugs.

01:05.717 --> 01:08.633
Maybe you should not begin
every morning with the paper.

01:08.677 --> 01:10.113
It makes you so cranky.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.855
Well, not today, because...

01:12.898 --> 01:15.945
this lion made friends
with a little wiener dog.

01:15.988 --> 01:18.469

You know what hope is

Babe, you don't have
to learn Creole.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.606
I'm just picking up
a few bons mots

01:24.649 --> 01:28.088
for my meeting with Haitian
President-elect Claude Galbert,

01:28.131 --> 01:31.134
an agent of democratic reform.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.745
You know, maybe after decades

01:33.789 --> 01:35.965
of mismanagement
and corruption,

01:36.008 --> 01:37.836
Haiti's finally
turning the corner,

01:37.880 --> 01:41.362
and I just want to show him
that we're his partner.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.667
And you think getting

01:42.711 --> 01:45.453
your Caribbean mojo on
is gonna do the trick?

01:45.496 --> 01:47.759
It's about showing respè.

01:47.803 --> 01:51.241
Reaching out
across a cultural divide.Oh.

01:51.285 --> 01:54.984
Speaking of reaching out,
I got a call from David Clark.

01:55.027 --> 01:57.595
Oh, the grim reaper.

01:57.639 --> 02:00.424
I think he prefers
"estate lawyer," but...

02:00.468 --> 02:02.687
Well, I would prefer
eternal life.

02:02.731 --> 02:05.951
What does Mr. Clark want
besides another retainer?

02:05.995 --> 02:07.562
He was doing his annual review

02:07.605 --> 02:10.173
of our estate plan,
and he wants to discuss

02:10.217 --> 02:11.870
some modifications to our will.

02:11.914 --> 02:13.698
All right, well...

02:13.742 --> 02:16.875
I can get Blake
to give me some times.

02:16.919 --> 02:20.009
Laissez les bons temps rouler. Hey.

02:20.052 --> 02:21.967
I'm the only diplomat
around here, pal.

02:22.011 --> 02:25.232
[laughs]: Butchering foreign
languages is my turf.

02:25.275 --> 02:27.495
Yeah, I'll stay in my lane.Good.

02:27.538 --> 02:30.193
I love you. Je t'aime.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.978
362 days ago she told me
she was going to fire me,

02:33.022 --> 02:34.197
as in terminate, discharge.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.677
Yes, and in the
intervening year,

02:35.720 --> 02:37.766
you've solidified yourself
as an indispensable member

02:37.809 --> 02:39.333
of her team.This is Washington.

02:39.376 --> 02:40.986
They dispense
with the indispensable.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.206
Relax. She hasn't said boo
to any of us

02:43.250 --> 02:44.990
about your demise.Demise?

02:45.034 --> 02:47.515
What Matt means is, your
future is not on her radar.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.865
Meaning she's forgotten?Yes, forgotten.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.519
Better?Yes.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.173
Good. Now we have
to prep M-Sec

02:53.216 --> 02:54.522
for President-elect
Galbert's visit,

02:54.565 --> 02:56.219
so if you're done
worrying about tomorrow,

02:56.263 --> 02:59.657
let's-let's focus on today.

02:59.701 --> 03:02.704
Indispensable.

03:02.747 --> 03:05.228
This is from an hour ago
inside the presidential palace.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.795
President Dupont
isn't going quietly.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.231
He's alleging election fraud.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.928
In the form
of voter intimidation,

03:09.972 --> 03:11.887
ballot stuffing,
and bribery.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.889
Any evidence
that stuff happened?JAY: Plenty.

03:13.932 --> 03:15.891
But only on Dupont's
side, and he still lost.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.807
OAS election monitors have
already certified the results.

03:18.850 --> 03:21.026
DAISY: Yeah, but Dupont is
alleging the monitors conspired

03:21.070 --> 03:23.246
with Galbert to cover up
election irregularities.

03:23.290 --> 03:26.423
He's repeating the allegation
on every media platform.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.686
Of course he is.It's the death rale

03:28.730 --> 03:31.211
of a flailing despot, ma'am.
He's just trying to sow chaos.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.909
Which is why we invited
President-elect Galbert here

03:33.952 --> 03:36.651
for a visit, to help
legitimize Haiti's election

03:36.694 --> 03:38.653
by recognizing its new leader.

03:38.696 --> 03:39.915
Well, that's one reason.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.047
The other is so that
we can assess Galbert.

03:42.091 --> 03:44.659
He talks a good game,

03:44.702 --> 03:46.095
but Haiti is run
by the oligarchs

03:46.138 --> 03:47.618
that propped up Dupont.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.141
They're the real power brokers.

03:49.185 --> 03:50.621
So we need to make sure
Galbert is willing

03:50.665 --> 03:52.754
to stand up to them
and embrace democracy

03:52.797 --> 03:54.364
before we give him
the official blessing.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.453
Exactly. And if he is

03:56.497 --> 03:59.761
the Haitian Jack Kennedy,
then I would recommend,

03:59.804 --> 04:02.590
actually, a photo op
with President Dalton.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.461
And if he's not?Then, after decades

04:04.505 --> 04:06.594
of misrule and bloodshed,

04:06.637 --> 04:09.988
hell, I'd settle for
the Haitian Martin Van Buren.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.947
We'll let you know when
he's wheels down, ma'am.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.123
Oh, and, Jay,
did you tell Matt

04:14.166 --> 04:15.951
about the...?Uh, was about to.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.648
Matt, in a gesture
of good will,

04:17.692 --> 04:20.303
the Dalton administration
and President-elect Galbert

04:20.347 --> 04:23.306
have agreed to a cultural
exchange during his visit.ELIZABETH: Yeah.

04:23.350 --> 04:26.918
And you've been paired with
Galbert's speechwriter, so...

04:26.962 --> 04:28.137
He's just gonna bird-dog you

04:28.180 --> 04:29.312
for a few days,
pick up a few pointers.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.358
Yeah, my dance card's
pretty full,

04:31.401 --> 04:33.969
and playing hall monitor
for a field trip...

04:34.012 --> 04:35.492
Huh.

04:35.536 --> 04:38.234
Where do I sign up?That's the spirit.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.149
Yeah.Oh.

04:40.192 --> 04:43.195
72 hours, punk.
Then I get the catapult.

04:46.198 --> 04:47.983
Forgotten, huh?

04:50.072 --> 04:52.422
Thanks, Remy.
Blake would be a good fit.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.772
I'll send you his résumé.
Thanks.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.340
Come in.
Hey.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.170
Okay, first, don't panic.Come on.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.477
This is my home. How am I
supposed to just leave?

05:03.520 --> 05:05.827
I've already set up meetings
for you

05:05.870 --> 05:07.655
with a few undersecretaries
here at State.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.831
Except-- thank you-- I...

05:09.874 --> 05:11.963
I don't want to leave
the inner circle.

ergonomically perfect desk.

05:16.925 --> 05:19.406
Madam Secretary has spoken.Yeah.

05:19.449 --> 05:22.887
What if I found another
job on her staff?For example?

05:22.931 --> 05:24.541
Public Affairs? Management?

05:24.585 --> 05:26.500
I tried Protocol.
That was probably

05:26.543 --> 05:28.719
the worst week of my life.What's your first choice?

05:28.763 --> 05:30.634
I know there's been talk about
adding to the advisory team.

05:30.678 --> 05:33.855
Well, why not me?

05:33.898 --> 05:35.160
I-I've been working with
Kat on the weekends.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.597
I-I've been auditing classes

05:36.640 --> 05:38.599
at Hopkins.It's a big move, Blake.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.992
You'd be one of M-Sec's
closest advisers overnight.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.646
I know.

05:42.690 --> 05:45.040
And I'm not expecting
preferential treatment

05:45.083 --> 05:48.217
because of my
history here. I...Good.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.958
Look, you got a lot of money
in the bank with her, but--

05:50.001 --> 05:51.394
and that-that
gives you a leg up,

05:51.438 --> 05:52.874
but you're still gonna
have to prove your bona fides.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.310
How?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.268
It'll come down
to the interview.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.140
Your relationship
will get you in the door,

05:58.183 --> 06:00.925
but your résumé is lacking.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.797
You'll have to impress her.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.016
Well, good. Well,
that'll work.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.889
I-I'm a type A people pleaser.

06:07.932 --> 06:10.239
I'm born to impress. Hey, what
if we did a practice interview?

06:10.282 --> 06:11.849
You've been here for years.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.547
I don't think that's necessary.

06:13.590 --> 06:14.983
Jay, come on, it'll
put me over the top.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.550
You're already over the top.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.203
Please, Jay,
I need to kill this.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.380
When M-Sec sits down with
me, she's got to think

06:20.423 --> 06:23.644
that I am the second coming
of... well, me.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.820
I'm proud of my tenure.

06:25.863 --> 06:28.344
My work. My attitude.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.215
Accomplishments
I can cite chapter and verse.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.392
I...Yes. Okay. Practice interview.

06:32.435 --> 06:35.046
Just stop... selling.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.831
Okay.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.136
Thank you.

06:39.790 --> 06:42.445
Just...

06:42.489 --> 06:44.447
This way.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.754
Secretary McCord.
It is an honor.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.277
The honor is ours,

06:48.320 --> 06:49.887
Mr. President-elect.

[speaks Haitian Creole]

06:51.541 --> 06:53.456
[chuckles]JAY:
We just heard

06:53.500 --> 06:55.850
the Haitian Supreme Court
dismissed Dupont's suit.Yes.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.286
To use an American expression,

06:57.329 --> 06:58.766
I believe
he has run out of road.

06:58.809 --> 07:01.246
Which is a great thing
for the Haitian people.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.031
Congratulations

07:03.074 --> 07:04.946
on your victory.

07:04.989 --> 07:06.643
Might we get acquainted?

07:06.687 --> 07:08.471
It would be a pleasure.Okay.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.605
[chuckles]I would hate
to see the other guy.

07:11.648 --> 07:14.608
Oh, the other guy was a
couple of basal cells,

07:14.651 --> 07:16.610
but my doctor kicked his butt.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.176
Matt Mahoney?Hmm?

07:18.220 --> 07:20.135
Dany Victor. President-elect
Galbert's speechwriter.Oh.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.659
Nice to meet you. Look, I'm
a little snowed in over here.I understand.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.356
I won't interfere.No, you won't.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.098
I just want to see how a master
craftsman plies his trade.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.274
Look, we'll set you up
in the National Archives,

07:29.318 --> 07:30.798
and...

07:30.841 --> 07:32.626
Master craftsman?

07:32.669 --> 07:34.976
That speech Madam Secretary
gave last month--

07:35.019 --> 07:37.239
patriotism versus nationalism.

07:37.282 --> 07:38.632
It was transcendent.

07:38.675 --> 07:41.678
Really? 'Cause that was my baby.

07:41.722 --> 07:44.551
I mean, M-Sec made a
few customary revisions,

07:44.594 --> 07:47.205
of course, but...And her Brandenburg address

07:47.249 --> 07:50.644
to mark the 25th anniversary
of the fall of the Berlin Wall.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.646
"Success is not final.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.952
"Failure is not fatal.
It is the courage

07:54.996 --> 07:57.651
to continue that counts.""...to continue
that counts." Yeah.

07:57.694 --> 08:00.175
Churchill, yes?No, not Churchill.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.569
An amalgam of various snippets
from multiple sources,

08:02.612 --> 08:05.963
including a 1938
Budweiser beer ad.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.792
[laughs] And you
were not afraid to use it?

08:08.836 --> 08:10.968
Afraid? Courage.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.231
Well, in the context

08:13.275 --> 08:16.713
of the speech, you made it soar.[chuckles]

08:17.845 --> 08:19.542
You know, why don't
you come on back.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.153
I'll show you where
the magic happens.

08:25.592 --> 08:29.291
We did not enjoy good relations
with Dupont's regime.

08:29.334 --> 08:31.772
Looking forward
to a fresh start.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.164
As am I.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.992
Well, that's great to hear,

08:35.036 --> 08:37.386
because your country
is key to the stability

08:37.429 --> 08:39.867
of the Caribbean
and Latin America.

08:39.910 --> 08:42.826
You have the potential to
be a great trading partner

08:42.870 --> 08:45.089
and an ally in the drug war.

08:45.133 --> 08:49.093
Yes, but that will require Haiti
to be treated as an equal.

08:49.137 --> 08:52.662
Over the last 200 years, you've
occupied us. Blockaded us.

08:52.706 --> 08:56.013
Used your resources
as both a carrot and a stick.

08:56.057 --> 08:58.581
We also didn't have a stable
government to interact with.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.714
I'm hoping that you'll help us

09:00.757 --> 09:02.367
write a new chapter
in our relationship.

09:02.411 --> 09:05.457
I would like that.JAY: Good. We've
drawn up a broad list

09:05.501 --> 09:06.981

to help you

09:08.548 --> 09:10.854
No, thank you.

09:10.898 --> 09:13.596
Mr. President-elect, that's
half a billion dollars in aid.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.598
And it comes at a cost.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.600
My country is run by NGOs.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.037
They provide essential
services, yes,

09:20.081 --> 09:21.604
but they only answer
to foreign donors.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.084
NGOs block out

09:23.127 --> 09:26.043
local businesses and continue
our cycle of dependence.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.089
Haiti must become
self-sufficient.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.918
Investment, not handouts.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.921
Okay, but in order to do that,
to attract investors,

09:33.964 --> 09:36.445
you'd-you'd have to crack down
on corruption.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.229
Stop the oligarchs
from looting the treasury.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.536
I intend to usher
in a new day,

09:40.580 --> 09:42.059
one that will not see

09:42.103 --> 09:44.192
Haiti beholden
to moneyed interests.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.934
Not NGOs or private citizens.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.023
All right.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.633
Daisy's gonna run you
through the press gauntlet.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.374
If you'll come with me, sir.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.463
Looking forward to working
with you, Madam Secretary.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.994
This guy needs
all the help he can get.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.301
He's taking the helm
of an impoverished republic

10:06.344 --> 10:07.737
teetering on the brink
of anarchy,

10:07.781 --> 10:10.958
and his first move is
to turn down outside assistance.

Your handiwork?

10:27.365 --> 10:28.889
Yep. Pro forma stuff.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.804
The secretary
will say a few words

10:30.847 --> 10:32.980
and then tee it up
for President Dalton.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.155
Would it be impertinent

10:34.198 --> 10:35.896
to suggest a minor
revision or two?

10:35.939 --> 10:37.549
Bring it on.

10:37.593 --> 10:38.942
You have a
comma splice

10:38.986 --> 10:41.336
on the bottom of page two.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.164
It's not technically...A parallel
construction issue

10:44.731 --> 10:46.950
Okay, but that's...And I think you
should reconsider

10:46.994 --> 10:48.996
the historical
antecedents you cite.

10:49.039 --> 10:51.563
There really is no analog
to the Haitian experiment.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.565
I wasn't looking for an analog.Oh, good.

10:53.609 --> 10:54.828
Because you
didn't find one.

very competent.

is a bit turgid.

The Haitian people won't

That's what Dupont

11:27.599 --> 11:28.818
Protests are already

11:28.862 --> 11:30.646

Giving him

martial law

11:32.735 --> 11:34.911

the Haitian Constitution.

11:38.610 --> 11:41.875

was enable an autocratic thug

its George Washington.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.200
Now that he's arrived,

12:46.243 --> 12:48.376
a dictator is spinning him
as an American operative.

12:48.419 --> 12:51.422
Dupont timed this perfectly.

12:51.466 --> 12:53.773
And even if Galbert
is duly elected,

12:53.816 --> 12:55.731
our public embrace of him

12:58.734 --> 13:02.259
Meaning if we want that
government to have legitimacy,

13:02.303 --> 13:05.393
Haiti has to dig itself
out of this mess.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.438
Or at least appear
to do so.

13:07.482 --> 13:10.093
So what's our best option?

13:10.137 --> 13:12.792
Well, the oligarchs

18:11.873 --> 18:13.092
jailed or in hiding.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.355
He even disbanded
the Supreme Court.Morning.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.270
Uh, ma'am,
President-elect Javert

18:17.313 --> 18:19.054
is ready
for his briefing.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.838
I think you mean Galbert.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.362
Yes.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.059
I'm sorry,
what did I say?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.713
Javert, as in Les Mis.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.671
I mean, it is a
miserable situation...

18:27.715 --> 18:28.977
I'm so sorry.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.761
I misspoke.No worries.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.329
I'll, uh, I'll let
President-elect Despair
know you're on your way.

18:33.373 --> 18:34.765
Uh. Galbert. Despair.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.550
I said "Despair" because
the situation's tragic.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.073
Yeah.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.380
[clears throat softly]

18:40.423 --> 18:42.208
[Elizabeth sighs]

18:42.251 --> 18:44.819
[whispers]:
All day.

18:44.862 --> 18:46.951
We'll do a pool spray
in the Oval...

18:46.995 --> 18:50.433
Mr. President-elect,
we have an update.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.783
We've had some success
coordinating a boycott

18:52.827 --> 18:55.046
among Caribbean and
American countries

18:55.090 --> 18:56.961
against Dupont's regime.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.093
How much success?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.660
JAY: 70% of the
associated nations

18:59.703 --> 19:01.923
have signed on
to our emergency sanctions.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.403
That won't do it.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.231
Dupont will simply bribe
the regional holdouts

19:05.274 --> 19:07.233
to act as trade intermediaries
with the other countries.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.235
We're also sponsoring
declarations

19:09.278 --> 19:11.802
to condemn Dupont's
power grab at the U.N.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.282
and the OAS.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.284
Meanwhile, my loyalists
are being shot.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.373
Buried in shallow graves.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.419
This is a purge,
Madam Secretary.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.116
We're doing all we can.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.422
I appreciate that.

19:22.465 --> 19:23.901
But I need to go back.

19:23.945 --> 19:25.773
Let my people know that
I am their rightful president,

19:25.816 --> 19:28.428
and that I won't be silenced.Respectfully, sir,
that's a bad idea.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.473
Dupont's branded you
an enemy of the people.

19:30.517 --> 19:31.779
I know the risks.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.781
But no one said patriotism
was without peril.

19:33.824 --> 19:36.827
You need to give us
just a little more time.

19:36.871 --> 19:39.613
Your sacrifice won't
help your country.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.615
Your survival will.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.269
Madam Secretary.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.619
Excuse me.

19:45.662 --> 19:48.317
JAY: I just got word
from a buddy at DoD.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.406
We're planning a major
assault on Haiti.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.495
What?
JSOC has already
drawn up plans.

19:52.539 --> 19:55.629
Carrier Strike Two is steaming
towards Port-au-Prince.

19:55.672 --> 19:58.022
Dalton ordered an invasion

19:58.066 --> 20:00.199
without convening the NSC?

20:00.242 --> 20:03.506
Seems like military intelligence
was part of the planning.

20:03.550 --> 20:06.857
The only principal
who wasn't apprised...

20:06.901 --> 20:08.685
Yeah.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.339
DALTON:
I was going

20:10.383 --> 20:13.299
to read you in before
ground forces made landfall.

20:13.342 --> 20:16.302
So you're-you're trying to save
me from the political backlash.

20:16.345 --> 20:19.348
Dupont is in total control
of the military.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.394
We're looking at hundreds
of American casualties,

20:21.437 --> 20:23.396
maybe more.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.833
Being front and center
of something like this is...

20:25.876 --> 20:28.488
it's not... not a great way
to launch your campaign.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.229
I can appreciate
that, sir,

20:30.272 --> 20:32.274
but as long as I am part
of this administration,

20:32.318 --> 20:34.102
I have to be able to do my job.

20:34.145 --> 20:36.931
You can't
worry about...

20:36.974 --> 20:39.107
protecting me.

20:40.804 --> 20:44.678
Well, you should, uh,
plan on managing the fallout.

20:44.721 --> 20:47.637
Russia will have something
to say about U.S. aggression.

20:47.681 --> 20:48.856
So will China.

20:48.899 --> 20:52.773
If you okay the assault, yes.

20:52.816 --> 20:56.516
But maybe we haven't
entirely exhausted our
diplomatic options.

20:56.559 --> 20:57.908
What options?

20:57.952 --> 21:00.389
We have a power-hungry madman

21:00.433 --> 21:03.087
instigating a civil war
600 miles off the coast
of Florida.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.307
He's slaughtering dissenters.Yes.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.483
But if we install Galbert,

21:07.527 --> 21:09.920
he risks being seen
as illegitimate.

21:09.964 --> 21:12.140
A puppet regime
doomed to fail.

21:12.183 --> 21:15.317
And we will have to do this
all over in ten years.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.753
All true.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.843
So I say again,
what options?

21:21.454 --> 21:25.284
Give me 48 hours to get
Dupont to step down.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.111
And if you fail?

21:27.155 --> 21:30.158
Then you send in the Marines.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.644
[translated]:
The men we killed were traitors.

21:37.687 --> 21:40.342
We have saved Haitian democracy.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.910
There has to be a way

21:42.953 --> 21:46.043
to convince him
to abdicate without bloodshed.

21:46.087 --> 21:47.262
Not an easy way.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.569
Dupont is a sociopathic
narcissist.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.180
That sort of
personality disorder

21:52.223 --> 21:53.964
is more likely to
respond to a threat

21:54.008 --> 21:56.097
by digging in
than standing down.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.099
So we don't issue a threat.

21:58.142 --> 22:00.754
We offer an inducement.Mm-hmm.

22:00.797 --> 22:02.843
Asylum.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.193
I think his ego's gonna need a
little more stroking than that.

22:05.236 --> 22:07.064
I would be thinking
golden parachute.

22:07.108 --> 22:08.936
A bribe instead
of a prison cell.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.285
I wouldn't call
it a bribe.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.027
I would call it...
realpolitik.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.811
Now you just need
to find someone

22:14.855 --> 22:17.292
who will embrace a
murderous dictator who's become

22:17.336 --> 22:19.076
an international
pariah.

22:23.429 --> 22:26.345
We're not asking Monaco
to harbor a war criminal,

22:26.388 --> 22:28.042
Counsellor Nadeau.No,

22:28.085 --> 22:30.784
Dupont is obviously the second
coming of Charles de Gaulle.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.960
We prefer to think of him
as an exiled leader

22:33.003 --> 22:33.961
in need of sanctuary.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.397
You can call him what you want.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.617
But the presence of his kind
is turning Monaco

22:37.660 --> 22:39.140
into a penal colony.

22:39.183 --> 22:40.446
I think that's a
bit hyperbolic.

22:40.489 --> 22:41.751
Really?

22:41.795 --> 22:43.840
Our principality
is less than one square mile.

22:43.884 --> 22:44.972
Now it seems we're teeming

22:45.015 --> 22:47.322
with tyrants, spies,
and strongmen

22:47.366 --> 22:50.238
the world community believes
should be sheltered here.

22:50.281 --> 22:52.066
It's time for us to draw a line.

22:52.109 --> 22:55.635
What does Prince Julien want
to undraw it?

22:55.678 --> 22:58.159
Surely you're not suggesting
His Serene Highness has a price.

22:58.202 --> 23:00.379
Oh, I've visited Monaco,
Counsellor Nadeau.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.685
Everything there has a price.

23:02.729 --> 23:05.166
And if the hundreds

23:05.209 --> 23:07.777
of millions Dupont is
going to throw around

23:07.821 --> 23:09.475
in your casinos
aren't enough,

23:09.518 --> 23:10.867
let's cut to the chase.

23:10.911 --> 23:13.304
I believe
President Dalton's recognition

23:13.348 --> 23:16.177
of Prince Julien's myriad
humanitarian contributions

23:16.220 --> 23:17.744
might be persuasive.

23:17.787 --> 23:20.355
What kind
of recognition?

23:20.399 --> 23:23.358
A ceremony in the Rose Garden.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.012
Some sort of a medal.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.493
Prince Julien favors gold,
by the way.

23:27.536 --> 23:29.233
Of course, he'll remove it

23:29.277 --> 23:32.367
before the Michelin-starred
state dinner.

23:34.717 --> 23:37.024
At least flattery's cheap.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.808
But hosing the White House down
from the trail of grease

23:38.852 --> 23:39.940
won't be.

23:40.984 --> 23:41.942
Where you going?

23:41.985 --> 23:43.247
To rip someone
a new one.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.380
That someone wouldn't be
Dany Victor, would it?

23:45.424 --> 23:46.686
That's your name
for him.

23:46.729 --> 23:49.210
I call him Monsieur
Bowtie Buttinsky.

23:49.253 --> 23:50.907
Listen, Matt...No. I have to host him.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.909
Fine. But I don't have
to coddle him.

23:52.953 --> 23:55.521
He's like Strunk and White with
rabies, and I've had enough.

23:55.564 --> 23:57.697
Matt, Matt, The Chronicle
just posted a list

23:57.740 --> 24:00.221
of confirmed victims in
last night's crackdown.

24:00.264 --> 24:01.962
Dany's father was on it.

24:04.051 --> 24:05.008
Does he know?

24:05.052 --> 24:07.576
Yes. So go easy
on him, okay?

24:08.621 --> 24:10.840
Matt, I've
identified

24:10.884 --> 24:14.148
a disturbing tendency in your
writing you should be aware of.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.802
A thematic drift.Dany...

24:15.845 --> 24:17.456
We have to stay on point.

24:17.499 --> 24:18.935
Our words can light
the darkness,

24:18.979 --> 24:20.415
but only if we
get them right,

24:20.459 --> 24:21.634
only if we...

24:21.677 --> 24:23.374
I'm sorry about your father.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.337
[sighs]

24:29.380 --> 24:33.776
I'm the first in my
family to go to college,

24:33.820 --> 24:36.866
to work in an office.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.477
It...

24:38.520 --> 24:41.262
it meant everything
to my dad.

24:42.872 --> 24:45.658
I can't let him down.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.927
Kids, Mom's home!
Let's do this!

24:53.970 --> 24:57.583
Oh, no. I-I said don't
wait for me for dinner,

24:57.626 --> 24:59.541
'cause I...W-We didn't.

24:59.585 --> 25:02.283
This is the family meeting
thing, remember?

25:03.284 --> 25:05.504
Right. Good. Yes.

25:05.547 --> 25:06.679
Any word from Monaco?

25:06.722 --> 25:08.202
Oh, still nothing.

25:08.245 --> 25:10.944
His Serene Highness
really living up to his billing.

25:10.987 --> 25:12.293
Won't hustle
for anybody.

25:12.336 --> 25:13.642
Uh, come on, come on, come on.Hey, gang.

25:13.686 --> 25:16.340
Hi. Um, hey, is this
gonna take long?

25:16.384 --> 25:19.169
'Cause Rafer and I have
a Call of Dutysession.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.389
HENRY: Well, that's as good
a transition as any.

25:21.432 --> 25:24.044
Okay, guys, your father and I
are eligible for burial

25:24.087 --> 25:25.480
at Arlington National.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.960
ALISON:
Oh, my God. I knew

25:27.003 --> 25:29.353
it wasn't just a
basal cell carcinoma.

25:29.397 --> 25:30.964
It absolutely is. Was. No.No.

25:31.007 --> 25:33.183
We're fine. I'm fine.Everybody's fine.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.577
This is...We're gonna live long enough
to burden your golden years.

25:35.621 --> 25:38.493
[laughs] That's... funny.We just need to make
some decisions.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.713
Yeah. Solicit your input.So we wanted
to consult with you

25:40.756 --> 25:42.715
about our burial plans.Yes. Because it
matters to us.

25:42.758 --> 25:43.933
JASON:
You guys should be

25:43.977 --> 25:45.152
cryogenically frozen.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.328
I think that technology
has been debunked.

25:47.371 --> 25:48.372
That's not on the table, pal.

25:48.416 --> 25:49.852
This is about
your presidential run.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.462
You guys are worried about
an assassination attempt.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.769
No. This is about...

25:53.813 --> 25:55.118
It's about planning
the future.

25:55.162 --> 25:57.468
And do you three
have an opinion

25:57.512 --> 26:00.341
about where you'd like
to visit us when we're...

26:00.384 --> 26:02.343
Is this some kind of, like,
"guilt from the grave" thing?

26:02.386 --> 26:03.692
Like, if we don't visit you
enough...Yeah.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.389
...you're gonna haunt our dreams
or something?

26:05.433 --> 26:06.869
What?Nothing to do with guilt.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.349
STEVIE:
Because I will be

26:08.392 --> 26:09.829
visiting you every year.

26:09.872 --> 26:11.831
Uh, for the first
few years.

26:11.874 --> 26:13.528
And-and then it's got
to taper off,

26:13.572 --> 26:15.182
because people might think
you have, like, a weird

26:15.225 --> 26:17.314
cemetery fetish.ALISON:
That's not a thing.

26:17.358 --> 26:19.926
Taphophilia. It's a--
it's a real thing.
I saw it on Six Feet Under.

26:19.969 --> 26:21.667
I love that show.Why do you know that?
That is so gross.

26:21.710 --> 26:22.842
It's great. It's...It's such a good...

26:22.885 --> 26:24.887
HENRY: [whistles]
Kids.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.454
Focus.

26:26.497 --> 26:27.890
Arlington.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.719
I'm gonna kick it back
to you guys.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.242
Yeah, same.Yeah. Me, too.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.549
Well, I had hoped
that you three

26:34.593 --> 26:36.551
were old enough to
take this seriously,[phone ringing]

26:36.595 --> 26:38.814
but, obviously, I'm wrong.
So we will revisit this

26:38.858 --> 26:40.773
at a later date.Okay,

26:40.816 --> 26:42.731
are you sure
you're not dying?

26:42.775 --> 26:44.907
Never. Jay, what's up?

26:45.908 --> 26:48.432
I'll be right there.

26:48.476 --> 26:51.914
I have to go deal
with a real crisis.

26:51.958 --> 26:53.350
JAY:
Dupont said

26:53.394 --> 26:54.438
it couldn't wait.

26:54.482 --> 26:55.918
Well, he understands
it's urgent.

26:55.962 --> 26:57.746
That's a start.

27:00.053 --> 27:01.010
Mr. President.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.708
I reviewed your proposal.

27:02.751 --> 27:05.580
And I think you'll agree
our terms are generous.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.887
We guarantee you
and your family

27:07.930 --> 27:10.672
safe transport out
of Haiti into Monaco,

27:10.716 --> 27:13.501
with your personal
fortune intact

27:13.544 --> 27:15.416
and amnesty for your war crimes.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.505
And if I decline your offer?

27:17.548 --> 27:20.073
It's not an offer,
Mr. President.

27:20.116 --> 27:21.727
It's a demand.

27:21.770 --> 27:25.818
Refusal of which will lead
to your forcible ouster.

27:25.861 --> 27:28.516
And pursuant of this demand,

27:28.559 --> 27:30.736
I can never leave Monaco,

27:30.779 --> 27:34.261
nor have contact
with my former associates.

27:34.304 --> 27:35.828
No, sir.

27:35.871 --> 27:39.440
There are restrictions
you must abide by.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.442
Then what you offer me
isn't a sanctuary.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.139
It's a prison.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.837
An expensive, gilded cage.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.840
We can also offer you
an inexpensive one.

27:47.883 --> 27:50.451
My flesh is the flesh
of this nation.

27:50.494 --> 27:53.410
If you uproot me,
I will die anyway.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.632
I refuse your offer.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.764
You're making a mistake.No.

27:58.807 --> 27:59.939
I am testing your resolve,

27:59.982 --> 28:01.941
and I will find it lacking.

28:01.984 --> 28:04.552
Because overthrowing me
will take many lives.

28:04.595 --> 28:07.642
President Dalton doesn't have
the appetite for that.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.558
Our carrier group
is poised to attack.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.995
Then you should tell them
to prepare for death.

28:13.039 --> 28:15.955
Because my soldiers
will fight to the last man.

28:15.998 --> 28:19.001
And I will lead them to glory.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.847
Oh, hey, Bob.

28:38.891 --> 28:39.892
I-I know.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.763
Weird to see me here
this early?

28:41.807 --> 28:43.722
Shouldn't have slipped you
those caffeine pills.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.288
Oh, no, no, no.
This isn't the pills.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.160
This is just anxiety.

28:47.203 --> 28:48.248
Oh.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.250
I'm being fired.

28:50.293 --> 28:51.904
No kidding.Yeah.

28:51.947 --> 28:54.254
It's an up-or-out thing,
which is tragic,

28:54.297 --> 28:57.257
because the thing I'm great at,
the thing I crush

28:57.300 --> 28:59.259
is being thorough,
assimilating information,

28:59.302 --> 29:01.435
organization--
my-my current job.

29:01.478 --> 29:04.786
The promotion is a,
is a policy job.
And I love policy.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.788
But it requires
improvisation and creativity.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.311
Hello, not my strong suit.
[chuckles]

29:08.355 --> 29:10.749
So the thing I'm good at,
I can no longer do.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.969
And the thing I want to do,
I'm not good at.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.363
The irony is so cruel.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.671
Oh. Yes, please.
Sorry.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.108
[grunts]

29:22.151 --> 29:23.762
Bob, what do you think?

29:23.805 --> 29:25.851
That you're a nutjob.

29:25.894 --> 29:28.505
But I know you got
what it takes.

29:28.549 --> 29:30.464
Or you wouldn't be here.

29:30.507 --> 29:33.815
What you need is confidence.

29:33.859 --> 29:36.426
Like my ma used to say,

29:36.470 --> 29:39.168
"Hide your light under a
bushel, you walk into walls."

29:39.212 --> 29:40.779
On the other hand,

29:40.822 --> 29:43.694
she also told me sanitation
would be a good field.

29:44.739 --> 29:45.958
Thanks, Bob.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.611
Mm.

29:51.093 --> 29:52.834
Morning, ma'am.Morning, Bob.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.967
Madam Secretary, I'm
sorry. I didn't realize

29:55.010 --> 29:57.273
you were here already.Been on the phone for an hour
with our Haitian ambassador.

29:57.317 --> 29:59.449
Things are spiraling
out of control.

29:59.493 --> 30:02.017
President Dalton wants
to caucus.

30:02.061 --> 30:03.714
Oh, here's a summary of the
Haitian crisis. Timeline.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.107
Dramatis personae.Yeah, well,

30:05.151 --> 30:06.892
that's probably old information
by now.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.502
But, you know what,
just bring it.

30:08.545 --> 30:09.938
You can brief me
in the car, okay?

30:10.983 --> 30:12.506
Let's go,

30:12.549 --> 30:14.203
bright eyes.Yeah.

30:15.509 --> 30:17.163
Marine battalions will make
landfall simultaneously

30:17.206 --> 30:19.034
at Jacmel and Cap-Haitien,

30:19.078 --> 30:20.644
whose harbors
are both poorly defended.

30:20.688 --> 30:23.125
They'll converge on
the presidential palace

30:23.169 --> 30:25.911
at Port-au-Prince, neutralizing
resistance along the way.

30:25.954 --> 30:28.522
Air support?Of minimal use, sir.
The Haitian Army

30:28.565 --> 30:31.177
is a guerrilla force likely
to embed with the population.

30:31.220 --> 30:34.136
So we anticipate
heavy civilian casualties.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.096
How tight a grip does Dupont
still have on the military?

30:37.139 --> 30:39.272
As long as they believe
he'll maintain the status quo,

30:39.315 --> 30:40.621
they'll fight for him,

30:40.664 --> 30:43.276
particularly if the oligarchs
aren't taking sides.

30:43.319 --> 30:46.018
Well, freezing their assets
didn't work.

30:46.061 --> 30:48.498
What about
the generals?

30:48.542 --> 30:49.673
We have even less
influence

30:49.717 --> 30:51.458
over them than the oligarchs.

30:51.501 --> 30:55.244
Their funds are in an account
in Honau Banc in Lichtenstein,

30:55.288 --> 30:57.116
an entity we have
no relationship with

30:57.159 --> 30:58.160
or jurisdiction over.

30:58.204 --> 30:59.553
[whispering]:
We may have leverage.

30:59.596 --> 31:00.989
What?Honau Banc.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.208
We have leverage.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.601
Got something
to say over there?

31:04.645 --> 31:05.994
Yes, you, Blake.

31:09.432 --> 31:12.087
Honau Banc, sir.

31:12.131 --> 31:14.916
A lot of Americans have money

31:14.960 --> 31:17.397
stashed there as well.BECKER: How would you know that?

31:17.440 --> 31:19.616
Honau Banc is the most private
bank in the world.

31:19.660 --> 31:22.271
Their client list
is a closely held secret.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.883
Not if you're in the
Harvard Assistants' Mafia.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.929
It's a lot less
nefarious than it sounds.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.410
There's no actual
racketeering.Blake.

31:30.453 --> 31:33.065
William Plowder
of Wheaton Strategies.

31:33.108 --> 31:34.805
Ed Katsouris,
AB21 Builders.

31:34.849 --> 31:37.243
Midge Luxley.
They all have

31:37.286 --> 31:41.551
holdings there
in-in shell companies.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.684
Billions.

31:43.727 --> 31:46.252
Sir, I think...
[chuckles]

31:46.295 --> 31:49.255
what Blake is implying

31:49.298 --> 31:51.997
is if we suggest to
these U.S. citizens

31:52.040 --> 31:56.218
that we're investigating the
bank for money laundering...

31:56.262 --> 31:58.655
We jeopardize their
relationship with Honau.

31:58.699 --> 32:00.614
So the bank might be willing
to seize the generals' accounts

32:00.657 --> 32:02.007
to get us
to stand down, sir.

32:02.050 --> 32:03.922
Which would compel
the generals

32:03.965 --> 32:06.881
to pull their support
from Dupont.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.449
Leaving him isolated
and defenseless.

32:09.492 --> 32:11.973
Elizabeth...I'm on it, sir.

32:14.758 --> 32:16.673
And, Blake...

32:18.849 --> 32:20.982
I don't appreciate people
with something useful to say

32:21.026 --> 32:24.986
keeping it to themselves,
so next time, speak up.

32:25.030 --> 32:28.816
Yes, Mr. President.

32:30.165 --> 32:31.645
So the generals
get amnesty

32:31.688 --> 32:33.299
for murdering hundreds
of dissenters.

32:33.342 --> 32:35.562
Yes.

32:35.605 --> 32:37.303
That doesn't sit
well with me.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.566
Neither does getting installed
by the mighty U.S.

32:39.609 --> 32:42.003
because they bribed the Haitian
military to switch sides.

32:42.047 --> 32:43.831
I'll take power
through a coup.

32:43.874 --> 32:45.398
You were democratically elected.

32:45.441 --> 32:48.227
That doesn't matter if I benefit
from foreign intervention.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.142
This is everything
I campaigned against.

32:50.185 --> 32:53.014
It's not the orderly transition
we all wanted.

32:53.058 --> 32:56.670
But you can make amends
by being the voice of reform

32:56.713 --> 32:59.064
and tolerance.

32:59.107 --> 33:01.196
Liberty.Madam Secretary...

33:01.240 --> 33:02.763
Or you can stand
on principle.

33:02.806 --> 33:05.505
Live out your days in exile.

33:05.548 --> 33:09.857
And watch Dupont strangle
the ideals you stand for.

33:09.900 --> 33:12.381
That's your choice.

33:30.921 --> 33:34.360
The military is backing Galbert.

33:34.403 --> 33:35.796
Unfortunately, it looks like

33:35.839 --> 33:37.624
someone gave Dupont
the heads-up.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.278
I just got off
with our embassy.

33:39.321 --> 33:42.063
Dupont has barricaded himself in
the presidential residence.

33:42.107 --> 33:44.326
He's got heavy artillery,
and a personal guard

33:44.370 --> 33:46.154
of about 500 men.[sighs]

33:46.198 --> 33:48.287
So we've either
just facilitated

33:48.330 --> 33:51.203
a peaceful transition of
power or set the stage...

33:51.246 --> 33:53.248
For a bloodbath.

34:02.301 --> 34:03.476
[translated]:
Under my leadership,

34:03.519 --> 34:07.088
Haiti has become
a regional power.

34:07.132 --> 34:11.179
With a flourishing economy.

34:11.223 --> 34:13.703
A stable government
that is the envy...

34:13.747 --> 34:15.357
20 minutes of lies
and self-aggrandizement.

34:15.401 --> 34:16.706
It's intolerable.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.534
Patience.

34:18.578 --> 34:21.711
He's stalling until
we button the deal.

34:21.755 --> 34:24.323
Dupont is holding out for safe
passage for his entire family.

34:24.366 --> 34:25.889
Eight sons,
four brothers.

34:25.933 --> 34:28.066
No.

34:28.109 --> 34:29.980
First the generals
and now Dupont's family?

34:30.024 --> 34:31.982
They're all murderers.

34:32.026 --> 34:34.898
Will there be no justice?

34:34.942 --> 34:39.468
Without your blessing, sir,
there will be no Haiti.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.514
[indistinct chatter over TV]

34:44.169 --> 34:46.388
We have a deal.

34:46.432 --> 34:51.045
[translated]:
Fraud. Intimidation.Yes.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.091
The reported result was...

35:00.402 --> 35:03.057
I am the legitimate president
of this country.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.973
But after a lifetime of service,

35:06.016 --> 35:09.107
it is time to retire.

35:09.150 --> 35:13.415
I congratulate my successor,
Claude Galbert.

35:22.816 --> 35:25.079
I believe the cost of this deal
was too great.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.689
Criminals who
receive absolution,

35:26.733 --> 35:29.214
who walk away with
billions they have stolen.

35:29.257 --> 35:33.131
I think in time you'll find
the price of his exit was cheap.

35:33.174 --> 35:34.610
That depends on
whether I have

35:34.654 --> 35:35.959
your country's
continued support.

35:36.003 --> 35:38.048
Of course.

35:38.092 --> 35:41.704
The United States will forever
be in Haiti's debt.

35:41.748 --> 35:43.053
I don't understand.

35:43.097 --> 35:46.405
The Haitian Revolution
bled the French dry.

35:46.448 --> 35:51.105
Napoleon needed money,
so he sold us a tract of land.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.498
The Louisiana Purchase.

35:52.541 --> 35:54.282
Your slave revolt
culminated

35:54.326 --> 35:56.980
in the creation
of an independent Haiti.

35:57.024 --> 35:59.200
And it doubled
our country's size.

35:59.244 --> 36:02.943
We are partners then.[chuckles]

36:02.986 --> 36:05.641
Two countries founded on
democratic revolution

36:05.685 --> 36:07.252
with a history of
helping each other.

36:07.295 --> 36:11.952
President Dalton won't forget
that and neither will I.

36:11.995 --> 36:15.347
Congratulations, Mr. President.

36:15.390 --> 36:17.218
Thank you,
Madam Secretary.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.611
[chuckles]

36:22.049 --> 36:25.139
[sighs] Dany,
congratulations.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.228
No time to rest on
our laurels.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.404
There's work to be done.

36:29.448 --> 36:30.753
President Galbert's
inauguration speech.

36:30.797 --> 36:31.928
Getting a jump start.

36:31.972 --> 36:35.976
Good idea,
lot of ground to cover.

36:36.019 --> 36:37.847
Look, I want to show you
something.

36:39.675 --> 36:43.636
The State Department has these
grants for study abroad.

36:43.679 --> 36:47.944
I have to go home to bury my
father and build my country.

36:47.988 --> 36:50.686
No, it's not for...
[sighs] Look.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.427
I petitioned the undersecretary

36:52.471 --> 36:55.604
for Public Diplomacy
and Public Affairs to rename

36:55.648 --> 36:58.694
one of the grants
in your dad's honor.

36:58.738 --> 37:01.436
The Andre Victor Scholarship.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.656
The worthy recipient will study
in your father's name.

37:03.699 --> 37:07.834
Thank you.

37:07.877 --> 37:09.618
I want to share something
with you, too.

37:09.662 --> 37:13.622
That's not necessary.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.363
You split too many infinitives.

37:15.407 --> 37:16.799
You can be better.

37:16.843 --> 37:20.281
And you dangle too many
participles.

37:20.325 --> 37:23.197
You couldn't be worse.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.727
[knocking on door]

37:31.771 --> 37:34.208
Madam Secretary,
I'm here for my interview.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.211
Uh, close the door, will you?

37:37.255 --> 37:39.213
[clears throat]

37:39.257 --> 37:40.562
Before we start,

37:40.606 --> 37:42.564
I want to apologize.

37:42.608 --> 37:45.306
In the Sit Room earlier,
I know that I overstepped.

37:45.350 --> 37:48.222
And it wasn't lost on me.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.269
Blake, I can't let you
interview.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.273
Okay. I-I understand.

37:55.316 --> 37:57.318
I just, I just want you
to know that, um,

37:57.362 --> 37:59.320
I-I really appreciate
the opportunity that you...

37:59.364 --> 38:01.235
I can't let you interview

38:01.279 --> 38:04.934
because you've been interviewing
every day

38:04.978 --> 38:07.110
for the last four years.

38:07.154 --> 38:08.982
Ma'am?

38:12.855 --> 38:16.946
You have demonstrated complete
commitment to this department,

38:16.990 --> 38:19.645
to the ideal of public service.

38:19.688 --> 38:23.213
And today,
in President Dalton's presence,

38:23.257 --> 38:26.956
you aced your final exam.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.829
So are you not firing me?

38:29.872 --> 38:32.440
Damn straight I'm firing you.

38:32.484 --> 38:35.965
And rehiring you
as my assistant policy adviser,

38:36.009 --> 38:39.665
a job for which
you are eminently qualified.

38:39.708 --> 38:42.798
I-I don't know what to say.

38:42.842 --> 38:44.496
How about "yes"?

38:44.539 --> 38:46.324
Yes.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.587
Now go out there
and pick another desk,

38:48.630 --> 38:51.154
one befitting a senior aide.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.200
[sighs]

38:56.638 --> 39:00.381
Uh, thank you, Madam Secretary.

39:07.214 --> 39:09.390
Oh, listen,
Clark called me again today

39:09.434 --> 39:12.045
to remind me
to get back to him

39:12.088 --> 39:14.177
about Arlington ASAP.Uh-huh.

39:14.221 --> 39:16.397
And he mentioned
that he reached out to you

39:16.441 --> 39:19.357
a few times
in the last couple of months,

39:19.400 --> 39:21.707
never heard back.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.709
Must have slipped my mind.

39:23.752 --> 39:26.233
Yeah, that's kind of
what I figured,

39:26.276 --> 39:27.930
and then I thought about it.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.978
You were the one that wanted
to involve the kids in this.

39:32.021 --> 39:33.675
Don't get me wrong,
it's a good idea.

39:33.719 --> 39:36.156
But it also delayed
the Arlington thing,

39:36.199 --> 39:37.723
so it's taken out
of our hands.

39:37.766 --> 39:40.334
Look, I'm not that invested
in-in Arlington,

39:40.378 --> 39:41.988
so if you don't want
to be there,

39:42.031 --> 39:44.556
why don't you just tell me?
What is going on?

39:44.599 --> 39:46.819
Are you freaked out
about the procedure?

39:46.862 --> 39:48.429
What?
The procedure.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.213
Oh. No. That's--

39:50.257 --> 39:52.085
I don't even--
I forgot about it.

39:52.128 --> 39:55.175
Then what is really going on?

39:55.218 --> 39:58.004
Every year on the anniversary
of my parents' death,

39:58.047 --> 39:59.875
I drive up
to Black Top Mountain

39:59.919 --> 40:01.703
where they got engaged.

40:01.747 --> 40:04.532
And I spend the day there
and I find them.

40:04.576 --> 40:05.968
Yeah. I-I know.

40:06.012 --> 40:08.406
And I think it's
a beautiful way to reconnect.

40:08.449 --> 40:10.277
It's the only way.

40:10.320 --> 40:14.716
I've never been to
their cemetery, Henry.

40:14.760 --> 40:17.806
Uh, I mean, not
since the burial.

40:17.850 --> 40:20.548
Wh-- I had no idea.

40:20.592 --> 40:23.769
It's just something about
their names etched in stone.

40:23.812 --> 40:26.859
You know, the horrible
finality of it all. I don't...

40:26.902 --> 40:29.514
Babe, we're all afraid
of d-- of dying.

40:29.557 --> 40:31.690
I'm not afraid
of dying, Henry.

40:31.733 --> 40:36.216
I'm afraid of losing
the people that I love.

40:38.697 --> 40:41.656
So if you don't visit
their gravesite...

40:41.700 --> 40:45.747
Then the little...

40:45.791 --> 40:49.447
something in me can...

40:49.490 --> 40:53.494
convince myself that
they are still here.

40:53.538 --> 40:55.583
Somewhere.

40:55.627 --> 40:57.759
It's stupid.It's not stupid.

40:57.803 --> 41:01.459
Listen, I've spent half my life
studying religion.

41:01.502 --> 41:04.940
I still don't have the first
idea what happens when we pass.

41:04.984 --> 41:07.726
But what I believe...

41:07.769 --> 41:10.946
in my bones...

41:10.990 --> 41:13.601
is that there
has to be somewhere.

41:13.645 --> 41:18.258
A place where part of us goes.

41:18.301 --> 41:22.349
And I will find you
and the kids there,

41:22.392 --> 41:24.656
because the universe
isn't big enough

41:24.699 --> 41:28.137
to keep that from happening.

41:28.181 --> 41:31.489
I need to get past this.

41:31.532 --> 41:34.143
Yeah.

41:34.187 --> 41:37.016
But you don't need
to do it alone.
