to hurt dad's feelings.

It's just not really fun
to play when you're--

I know you love this game, and
I know I'm not very good at it.

10:02.768 --> 10:03.970
- No.
It's me, Dad.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.605
Look, sometimes
when you plant a yam,

10:06.672 --> 10:10.843
that yam grows up and decides
to switch teams with its dad,

10:10.910 --> 10:12.712

10:12.778 --> 10:17.984

void of nutrients, you know?

10:18.050 --> 10:19.552
- Yeah. I think I do.
