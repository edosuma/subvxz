00:07.424 --> 00:09.676
into the chest
of Lieutenant Tony Rodriguez.

00:09.884 --> 00:11.594
The only question is "why?"

00:11.803 --> 00:14.347
Tony Rodriguez went for his gun first

00:14.556 --> 00:16.641
in an effort to silence
his loudest critic.

00:16.891 --> 00:19.519
The only thing Captain Fraker
is guilty of is doing his job.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.939
What he deserves is not a conviction,
but a commendation.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.816
Detective, what did you say
to Captain Fraker?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.484
I said if he didn’t back off
the lieutenant,

00:26.568 --> 00:28.778
I’d tell his wife that he was sleeping
with a subordinate.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.157
You blackmailed a superior officer
who had you under investigation,

00:32.240 --> 00:33.283
a man you admitted you don’t like.

-You know him?
-Yeah.

She gave us a runaround
on a Murphy gay murder a while back.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.914
So, five minutes ago, when I said,
"Don't I know you from somewhere..."

01:20.997 --> 01:22.832
We were never introduced, sir.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.751
We saw each other from across
the squad room,

01:24.834 --> 01:25.919
so technically, we never did meet.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.463
And technically, you’re still a man, Dan.

I came by about 8:30 to return
some CDs...

01:44.771 --> 01:47.816
and I saw Mel like that,
so, I called the cops.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.400
-How’d you get in?
-MONIKA: A key.

So, Sergeant Martens,
the hands-on attention

03:41.262 --> 03:44.891
Captain Fraker was giving
the 15th Squad was unusual?

03:45.141 --> 03:46.893
In my experience, unheard of.

03:47.393 --> 03:51.648
Did you see anything that would justify
such intensive scrutiny of the 15th?

03:51.940 --> 03:52.982
No.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.069
Did any of the defendant’s
investigations into the 15th

03:56.319 --> 03:58.655
-result in disciplinary action?
-No.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.115
The allegations always
came back unfounded.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.202
Did the defendant ever say
anything disparaging

04:04.285 --> 04:06.371
about Lieutenant Rodriguez
in your presence?

04:06.454 --> 04:09.791
-Objection.
-Overruled. The witness can answer.

04:10.124 --> 04:12.794
He said the lieutenant was a backstabber
and couldn't be trusted,

04:13.086 --> 04:14.754
and that someone like that had
to be dirty.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.548
You ever see any evidence to support
such an allegation?

04:17.632 --> 04:18.633
None.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.677
And on the day Lieutenant Rodriguez
was shot,

04:20.760 --> 04:22.720
did you have a conversation
with the defendant?

04:23.096 --> 04:26.766
JERRY: The captain informed me, his affair
with a subordinate had been found out,

04:26.849 --> 04:29.852
and that he had just been passed over
for promotion to deputy inspector.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.729
And did the defendant indicate that

04:31.813 --> 04:33.982
he blamed Lieutenant Rodriguez
for any of that?

04:34.315 --> 04:37.443
Yes. He said the lieutenant had screwed
him for the last time.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.279
Nothing further.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.574
(CHAIR CREAKING)

04:44.867 --> 04:48.955
You say you saw nothing to justify
intensive scrutiny of the 15th?

04:49.038 --> 04:52.917
Are you suggesting the captain conducted
investigations that were without merit?

04:53.167 --> 04:55.461
No, but they weren’t what you call
strong cases.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.757
And isn’t it true that the vast majority
of IAB investigations

04:59.841 --> 05:01.718
result in no disciplinary action?

05:02.510 --> 05:04.679
Most allegations are unsubstantiated.

05:05.013 --> 05:08.558
So, five investigations yielding nothing,
that’s not unusual, is it?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.101
Not in and of itself.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.061
-That a no?
-It’s a no.

05:13.479 --> 05:16.607
How long were you in Internal Affairs
before the incident

05:16.691 --> 05:18.735
that resulted in our being here today?

05:18.985 --> 05:20.069

05:20.320 --> 05:24.324

did you ever receive supervisory pay?

05:24.490 --> 05:25.491

Isn’t it a fact that one week
after Captain Fraker’s arrest,

05:30.288 --> 05:33.833
you received a pay bump
to top lieutenant’s pay?

05:34.208 --> 05:35.209

18:55.300 --> 18:57.511

for simple assault

-about Lieutenant Rodriguez?
-Yes.

of those conversations?

into Internal Affairs.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.886
I had broken things off a month earlier,
but he wouldn’t let go.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.055
I told him I was sorry for what happened.

21:47.347 --> 21:51.059
I also said that I’d hired a lawyer
and was meeting with the inspector

21:51.143 --> 21:53.270
to discuss a sexual harassment suit.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.938
What was that suit based on?

21:55.022 --> 21:57.941
The captain had made it clear
that unless we got back together,

21:58.317 --> 22:00.861
my opportunities for advancement
were gonna be limited.

22:00.944 --> 22:03.155
And how did the defendant react
to the news of the suit?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.032
He cursed at me and stormed off.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.535
Detective, does your lawsuit
have anything to do

22:08.618 --> 22:10.620
-with your appearance here today?
-No.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.247
Thank you.

22:15.542 --> 22:19.838
Detective, did you get your associates
degree from Moreland City College?

22:20.047 --> 22:22.257
-I did.
-And isn’t it true you filed

22:22.341 --> 22:24.760
a sexual harassment suit
against a professor?

22:24.843 --> 22:26.345
Objection. This is irrelevant.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.348
Your Honor, this shows a pattern
of hostility toward superiors.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.726
Too far afield, Mr. Sinclair. Sustained.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.144
No more questions.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.068
(MUSIC PLAYING)

22:45.614 --> 22:47.366
CONNIE: Josh, your friend, Rick, folded.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.203
-Folded?
-He said you came in late to work.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.080
Which differs a little
from what you said to us.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.335
Rick had to choose between lying for you
and going to jail,

22:58.502 --> 23:00.128
or staying out and taking care of his mom.

23:00.253 --> 23:01.671
So, I was a little off on my timeline.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.757
Don’t compound your problems
by being an idiot.

23:04.007 --> 23:06.009
’Cause if you keep up
with this tired-ass song and dance,

23:06.093 --> 23:08.929
we’ll just toss you in the system,
and you can deal with all this at trial.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.058
Do you want your wife and kids
to hear how dad was banging a guy?

23:13.266 --> 23:14.643
I never did that with Melissa. Never.

23:14.851 --> 23:16.895
Melissa, try Carl Gustafson.

23:17.145 --> 23:18.563
That’s the name the DA
will be using in court.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.899
What happened this morning, Josh? Hmm?

23:21.483 --> 23:23.235
Let’s keep the circle as tight
as possible.

23:27.406 --> 23:31.451
She was gonna tell my wife.
Tell her things that we never even did.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.286
Did the fight jump off
while you were there?

23:33.412 --> 23:34.704
Or were you pissed before you showed up?

23:34.830 --> 23:36.415
No, it happened right there.
I just lost it.

23:36.623 --> 23:37.666
That’s good.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.751
That way, it wasn’t premeditated,
it was as a crime of passion.

23:40.127 --> 23:42.087
Ain’t no passion involved
between me and Melissa.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.589
She was gonna tell lies about me,
and I reacted!

23:44.714 --> 23:47.050
-It’s just a legal term.
-As soon as it was done, I left.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.969
-I didn’t even take her money.
-What money?

23:49.302 --> 23:51.930
She had 12 grand stashed
under the linoleum in the living room.

23:52.013 --> 23:53.223
Saving it for a sex change.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.724
I’d always yell at her,
"Put it in the bank."

23:55.183 --> 23:56.351
She never trusted no one.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.855
-Where in the living room?
-In the closet, by the front door.

24:00.230 --> 24:03.233
I saw her adding to it when I walked in,
and it’ll still be there,

24:03.483 --> 24:05.485
because this was not about
taking her money.

24:05.694 --> 24:09.281
This was about me trying to stop her
from ruining my life with lies.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.117
I’ll get Greg and Baldwin to look into it.

24:13.910 --> 24:14.911
(DOOR OPENS)

24:15.912 --> 24:18.874
-Me and Melissa never had sex.
-Yeah, that’s what you keep saying.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.252
Yeah, but see...

24:23.044 --> 24:25.130
See, you ain’t giving me no guarantees.

24:25.255 --> 24:29.843
You gotta make the DA happy first,
then they consider your explanation.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.720
So, I do my statement, right?

24:32.137 --> 24:35.599
What’s keeping them from saying,
"Screw him, 20 years"?

24:35.891 --> 24:38.602
Because of the sympathetic content
of your statement.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.854
All right, let me show you.
Tell me what went down

24:40.979 --> 24:43.023
with the old woman on Avenue C,
Violet Walker.

24:44.024 --> 24:47.819
Just came up, said, "Keep your cool,
give me the purse."

24:48.695 --> 24:50.655
-Did you raise your voice to her?
-Kept it quiet.

24:50.864 --> 24:53.033
-JOHN: You intend to hurt her?
-Hell, no.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.618
See, that shows character.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.244
Why’d you need the money
in the first place?

24:56.536 --> 25:00.081
I mean, food, booze, new gear.

25:00.207 --> 25:05.212
Nathan! You got a sick aunt, right?
She got doctor bills, she needs medicine.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.422
-That stuff adds up.
-She got insurance.

25:08.131 --> 25:11.593
But don’t a few extra bucks here and there
make her more comfortable?

25:11.843 --> 25:14.763
Maybe it’s the difference
between a good doctor and a hack?

25:15.180 --> 25:16.932
All right, I mean, yeah.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.642
That cash went to my aunt.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.436
That shows you were selfless.
You put that in the statement,

25:21.645 --> 25:23.605
what heartless asshole would
give you 25 years?

25:24.064 --> 25:26.858
-Guess I don’t got much choice.
-All right, so here we go, hmm?

25:27.484 --> 25:30.278
-But I ain’t going for the doc.
-(SIGHS)

25:32.489 --> 25:35.325
All right, you got bad blood with the doc,
that’s on record. Huh?

25:35.534 --> 25:38.119
He picked you out of a photo array,
that’s on record.

25:38.745 --> 25:41.831
You are going down for the doc,
with or without the statement.

25:41.915 --> 25:45.544
What we are trying to do here
is give you a chance to explain

25:45.710 --> 25:47.546
why you stalked him to his hospital,

25:47.754 --> 25:51.299
why you lied in wait and cut him
and threatened to kill him.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.760
Without this statement, it's 25 years.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.137
With it, we can argue to lump it
in with the other robberies.

25:56.304 --> 25:58.390
All right, we ask them to drop
the threats, the assaults,

25:58.598 --> 26:00.892
the past history,
instead of attempted murder,

26:01.226 --> 26:03.979
you just go for five robberies
instead of four.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.189
Won’t buy you a single extra day.

26:08.066 --> 26:11.403
-The offer is fading fast, Nathan.
-Damn, damn, damn!

26:13.238 --> 26:14.281
How’d it go down?

26:16.491 --> 26:17.617
Like you said.

26:18.618 --> 26:20.328
I waited for him in the parking lot,

26:20.620 --> 26:23.915
-came up on him, got his cash.
-Why did you stab him?

26:24.165 --> 26:27.627
-He came at me. It wasn’t out of anger.
-Write it up.

26:28.253 --> 26:31.047
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

26:35.302 --> 26:36.928
Josh admitted to killing Melissa.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.847
Ugh. That son of a bitch.

26:38.930 --> 26:42.809
Now, if we can just get the 12 grand
that you took out of Melissa’s apartment,

26:42.976 --> 26:44.769
-we’ll be done.
-Excuse me?

26:44.978 --> 26:46.062
You heard what I said.

26:46.354 --> 26:47.689
Are you calling me a thief?

26:47.939 --> 26:49.149
Not if we get it back.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.652
I didn’t take her money.
Maybe you should ask Josh.

26:52.861 --> 26:55.614
He’s the one who told us where
the money used to be, but he didn’t do it.

26:55.864 --> 26:59.367
-Hello, he’s a murderer.
-Yeah, and he's not that bright.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.829
He wouldn’t try and pull some
double-reverse psychology move on us.

27:02.912 --> 27:04.789
If he took the money,
he wouldn’t have brought it up.

27:04.914 --> 27:08.001
Okay, so then maybe you should ask
one of the cops who was there.

27:08.084 --> 27:10.295
I didn’t see any halos
when they walked in the door.

27:10.420 --> 27:14.466
Monika, tell us where the money is.
Once we have it, you walk.

27:14.549 --> 27:17.677
This is so outrageous.
I don’t even know how to respond.

27:17.844 --> 27:22.432
Okay, then we will turn you,
your apartment, your life, inside out.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.143
And we will find the money the hard way
and you will go to jail.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.895
(LAUGHS)

27:28.855 --> 27:30.774
All right, you're staying here
while we look.

27:32.233 --> 27:35.278
-(SIGHS) It’s gone.
-Stop playing games.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.405
I swear it’s gone. You’ll never find it.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.991
Where’s the money, Dan?

27:40.909 --> 27:43.662
-I sent it to my son.
-Enough with the lies.

27:43.745 --> 27:44.829
-I swear...
-Enough!

27:48.833 --> 27:50.710
I got a girl pregnant in high school.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.088
Her parents said that
they’d take care of her

27:53.338 --> 27:56.549
and our son if I wasn’t in the picture,
so I split.

27:58.885 --> 27:59.886
He’s 11.

28:01.429 --> 28:02.889
You need to get that money back.

28:03.139 --> 28:04.641
His mom’s broke.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.560
She lost her job,
she’s looking to get evicted.

28:07.644 --> 28:10.438
And I finally have a chance to help.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.274
Melissa, baby, I know
you’re looking down here right now,

28:13.358 --> 28:15.527
and I know that’s where
you’d want that money to go.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.071
If you’re making up a lie
about some poor kid...

28:18.154 --> 28:19.197
MONIKA: I’m not.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.449
The money’s gone,
and it’s gonna stay gone.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.536
-I’ll never tell you where they live.
-It’s not like we can’t find out.

28:24.953 --> 28:28.289
Then just put me in jail.
I'll do the time.

28:28.456 --> 28:30.625
But please don’t take that money
away from them.

28:32.752 --> 28:33.920
ANDY: Number four.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.550
Tell the cops, and I'll kill you.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.219
I don’t... (SIGHS)

28:42.470 --> 28:43.722
I’m just not sure.

28:46.599 --> 28:47.976
One more time, number four.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.649
Tell the cops, and I'll kill you.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.616
-Again, I'm so sorry I can’t be more help.
-It’s all right, doc.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.202
I feel like such a fool that
I didn’t pay closer attention

29:06.286 --> 29:08.329
to what he looked like or how he sounded.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.123
Given the situation, it’s forgivable.

29:10.331 --> 29:13.001
And don’t worry about the ID.
The case will make, regardless.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.794
-How so?
-The perp confessed.

29:15.253 --> 29:18.173
-Really?
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)

29:18.590 --> 29:21.217
-Lieu, you heading to court?
-Heywood just called.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.179
Doc, you need a ride back to the hospital?

29:24.262 --> 29:27.474
No, I'll be fine.
Thank you... for everything.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.938
Don’t let the serpent get to you.

29:34.814 --> 29:36.941
Yeah. I got it covered.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.954
Lieutenant, when did you first see
the defendant the day you were shot?

29:51.206 --> 29:56.419
Early afternoon. Came by my office,
said that my squad was out of control.

29:56.669 --> 29:59.422
Long lunches, folks leaving early,
that sort of thing.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.966
Could you describe the defendant’s
demeanor at the time?

30:02.342 --> 30:04.385
Confrontational, as usual. Angry.

30:04.511 --> 30:07.806
And did you have an occasion to see
the defendant later that afternoon?

30:08.014 --> 30:12.101
Yes. He barged in my office again,
toward the end of the tour,

30:12.185 --> 30:14.395
demanded that I find Detective Sipowicz.

30:14.604 --> 30:18.608
And did you notice anything unusual
about his appearance at that time?

30:18.900 --> 30:21.402
He was disheveled.
He was slurring his words.

30:21.611 --> 30:24.322
I could smell the alcohol on his breath
from across the room.

30:24.489 --> 30:25.615
What happened next?

30:25.865 --> 30:28.201
He said that I ratted him out
when he was in uniform,

30:28.409 --> 30:31.162
and now I ratted him out
for sleeping with a subordinate.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.623
Neither allegation was true,
and I told him that.

30:33.873 --> 30:36.334
-Did you ask him to leave?
-Several times.

30:36.584 --> 30:38.795
I even said I'd get an officer
to take him home.

30:38.878 --> 30:40.255
He just got more riled.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.298
Finally called me a dirty-spic rat.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.801
How did you respond to that?

30:45.009 --> 30:47.846
I stood up, told him if he didn’t leave,
I’d kick his ass.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.223
VALERIE: And did you move
towards him at any time?

30:50.306 --> 30:52.475
No, I never came out from behind my desk.

30:52.725 --> 30:54.894
-Raise your hands at any time?
-No.

30:55.019 --> 30:58.398
-Reach for your gun at any time?
-Absolutely not.

30:58.648 --> 30:59.858
VALERIE: What happened next?

31:00.108 --> 31:02.068
The captain turned like he was leaving...

31:03.570 --> 31:06.239
and he pulled his gun
and shot me in the chest.

31:06.447 --> 31:09.158
Next thing I remember,
I was waking up in I.C.U. two days later.

31:09.492 --> 31:10.577
Thank you, lieutenant.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.667
Lose your temper a lot, lieutenant?

31:18.042 --> 31:19.127
No, I don’t.

31:19.210 --> 31:23.298
So, threatening a superior officer,
that was an unusual event?

31:23.464 --> 31:26.301
Yes, just like a superior officer

31:26.551 --> 31:29.596
walking in drunk and out of control
was unusual.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.472
JAMES:
So, the captain provoked you, right?

31:31.806 --> 31:34.309
To telling him to leave my office?
You bet.

31:34.976 --> 31:39.272
And did a homeless man named
Robert Delgado provoke you in 1996,

31:39.355 --> 31:40.773
when you broke his arm?

31:40.857 --> 31:42.984
-Objection, Your Honor.
-Goes to pattern.

31:43.276 --> 31:44.360
Overruled.

31:45.904 --> 31:51.576
I was supervising a narcotics raid.
Mr. Delgado was six foot four, 240 lbs.

31:51.826 --> 31:54.287
He became agitated
and attacked an officer.

31:54.495 --> 31:55.914
It took four of us to subdue him.

31:56.039 --> 31:59.459
But you were put on modified assignment
for two days, correct?

31:59.584 --> 32:03.004
Which is routine when a civilian complaint
is filed. I was cleared.

32:03.212 --> 32:06.799
Hmm. You received two complaints
for excessive force

32:06.883 --> 32:08.092
when you were in narcotics, right?

32:08.343 --> 32:09.636
TONY: Over 14 years.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.305
You’re in the field as much as I was,
you ruffle a few feathers.

32:12.388 --> 32:13.431
It goes with the territory.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.934
Another complaint
when you were in uniform.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.727
Goes with the territory, right?

32:18.019 --> 32:19.646
I was never disciplined for anything,

32:19.729 --> 32:21.773
and I'd put my record up
against any cop's.

32:22.023 --> 32:25.318
How about your personal life, lieutenant?
Any temper problems there?

32:25.610 --> 32:27.195
Your Honor, I must object again.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.697
Lieutenant Rodriguez is the victim
in this case,

32:29.948 --> 32:31.491
his character is not at issue.

32:31.824 --> 32:34.494
Overruled. Answer the question,
lieutenant.

32:34.869 --> 32:37.205
-No temper problems at all.
-Mm-hmm.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.500
So, when the police responded

32:40.583 --> 32:44.712
to a domestic disturbance complaint
at your apartment on May 7, 1993,

32:45.088 --> 32:46.631
that had nothing to do with your temper?

32:47.298 --> 32:49.300
My ex-wife had a drug problem.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.471
At times, she’d become paranoid,
hysterical.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.390
It was all I could do to calm her down.

32:55.932 --> 33:00.103
Broken arms, domestic arguments,
requiring police intervention.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.313
And you don’t have
a temper-control problem...

33:02.480 --> 33:04.148
Objection. Argumentative.
Asked and answered.

-Sustained.
-Let’s talk about the day of the incident.

33:09.195 --> 33:11.489
The first time Captain Fraker came by,

33:11.906 --> 33:14.200
he announced a series of investigations,
correct?

33:14.409 --> 33:15.493
That’s right.

33:15.618 --> 33:17.745
What would these investigations
have done to your career?

33:18.287 --> 33:20.415
Nothing, because the charges
were without merit.

33:20.623 --> 33:22.000
Assuming they had merit?

33:22.208 --> 33:24.794
-Objection. Calls for speculation.
-I’ll allow it.

33:26.421 --> 33:29.882
-I suppose I could have been disciplined.
-Not just disciplined, lieutenant.

33:30.216 --> 33:32.051
You would have lost your command, right?

33:32.301 --> 33:35.471
-You have to ask IAB that.
-I’m asking you, lieutenant.

33:35.722 --> 33:39.559
You knew Captain Fraker posed
a grave threat to your career, didn't you?

33:39.642 --> 33:40.643
He didn’t.

33:40.893 --> 33:43.896
Then he came by again.
Antagonized you further.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.064
I dealt with him.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.900
An IAB officer tells you
your career is over,

33:47.984 --> 33:50.194
calls you a dirty spic,
and you just dealt with it?

33:50.361 --> 33:52.697
-Objection! Asked and answered.
-Sustained.

33:52.947 --> 33:54.574
You didn’t just threaten Captain Fraker,
did you?

33:54.657 --> 33:57.076
-You reached for your gun, right?
-I did not!

33:57.201 --> 33:59.454
You were provoked!
Your career was on the line!

33:59.662 --> 34:01.581
-Your Honor, counsel’s badgering!
-Sustained!

34:01.831 --> 34:04.292
He was drunk and he shot me!
That’s what happened!

34:04.584 --> 34:08.337
Would the court remind the witness
he's testifying under penalty of perjury?

34:08.546 --> 34:11.340
Objection! That’s totally improper,
and counsel knows it!

34:11.549 --> 34:16.054
The jury will disregard that question!
Don’t try that again, Mr. Sinclair!

The defense has no further questions.

from the DOA's apartment.

and could really use the money.

and the DOA were best friends,

35:14.779 --> 35:17.490

to steal the DOA's money...

to get the money to...
