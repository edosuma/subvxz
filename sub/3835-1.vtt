02:04.141 --> 02:07.141
In the wake of the Nicaraguan revolution...

02:07.141 --> 02:11.141
...chaos has descended on tiny
El Salvador, in Central America.

02:11.141 --> 02:14.141
Today, 18 people were
killed and 36 wounded...

02:14.141 --> 02:18.100
...in a fierce gun battle between
demonstrators and the national police.

02:19.141 --> 02:23.100
It started when students, workers and
peasants linked to the guerillas...

02:24.141 --> 02:28.141
...occupied foreign embassies
and took over the National Cathedral.

02:28.141 --> 02:32.141
So far, in two months, more than
3000 people have disappeared.

02:32.141 --> 02:36.141
The government blames the murders
on left-wing Marxist terrorists...

02:36.141 --> 02:40.141
...while left-wing spokesmen
point to the right-wing death squads.

02:40.141 --> 02:42.141
You cannot walk in like this!

02:42.141 --> 02:45.141
Good morning.
You got some money for me?

02:45.141 --> 02:48.141
- No, I have no money.
- I want you out of here, okay?

02:48.141 --> 02:50.141
- We cannot go out!
- I want you out!

02:50.141 --> 02:53.141
Look, I put up with
this shit every month.

02:53.141 --> 02:55.141
I want you, your crumb-snatcher...

02:55.141 --> 02:58.141
...and your war hero, or
whatever the fuck he is...

02:58.141 --> 03:00.141
...I want him out of here!

03:00.141 --> 03:04.100
Fuck your husband! You got no bucks...
No bucks, no Buck Rogers, Boyle!

03:05.141 --> 03:07.141
Wait until I've had my coffee, huh?

03:07.141 --> 03:10.141
- You're disturbing my kid.
- Better get your bitch!

03:10.141 --> 03:14.100
Shit on your papers!

03:22.141 --> 03:25.141
Good morning.

03:25.141 --> 03:27.141
I've had it!

03:27.141 --> 03:30.141
I cannot live like this no more!

03:30.141 --> 03:32.141
Nancy, it's Richard.
Listen...

03:32.141 --> 03:34.141
- Richard who?
- Boyle.

03:34.141 --> 03:36.141
- Oh.
- Richard Boyle, yeah.

03:36.141 --> 03:39.141
I think El Salvador's
gonna blow real soon.

03:39.141 --> 03:42.141
With a new press card and two grand
I can get some good stuff.

03:42.141 --> 03:44.141
- No way.
- Okay.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.141
- How about a new press card?
- Forget it.

03:46.141 --> 03:49.141
- Come on, Nancy, please!
- I gotta go.

03:49.141 --> 03:53.141
We've had it with you. We gave
you $2500 on that Lebanon gig.

03:53.141 --> 03:57.100
- You fucked it away in Greece.
- I can't take Muslim nightlife, okay?

03:58.141 --> 04:00.141
You lose tickets, passports,
you drink...

04:00.141 --> 04:03.141
...and you're an embarrassment,
Boyle.

04:03.141 --> 04:04.141
I get the piece, don't I?

04:04.141 --> 04:07.141
How about the IRA, "Tortured
by the Brits in Belfast"?

04:07.141 --> 04:10.141
And how about Cambodia,
"The Last Man Out"?

04:10.141 --> 04:13.141
Sidney Schamburg was having
cocktails at the Plaza...

04:13.141 --> 04:15.141
...and I was getting my ass kicked.

04:15.141 --> 04:19.100
How about freezing my nuts off
in the Khyber Pass? I got giardia.

04:20.141 --> 04:24.141
- I was stapled to the toilet for weeks.
- Remember El Salvador?

04:24.141 --> 04:27.141
How about El Salvador?
Didn't I call that one?

04:27.141 --> 04:29.141
- Huh, Nancy? Come on.
- Bye.

04:29.141 --> 04:33.141
- Hey, come on.
- Get the fuck out of here, will you?

04:33.141 --> 04:35.141
Not you, Nancy. Nancy?
I'm sorry. Nancy?

04:35.141 --> 04:37.141
Nice work, you piece of...

04:37.141 --> 04:40.141
Larry, I need another favor.

04:40.141 --> 04:43.141
I gotta be at the airport
in an hour for Beirut.

04:43.141 --> 04:45.141
This is serious. For old times' sake.

04:45.141 --> 04:48.141
You gotta give me $500 to go
to El Salvador, $400...

04:48.141 --> 04:50.141
They'll kill you
if you go back there.

04:50.141 --> 04:52.141
I need money, not a lecture.

04:52.141 --> 04:55.141
Okay, $300. I'll meet you
at Pan Am in 40 minutes.

04:55.141 --> 04:56.141
Great.

04:56.141 --> 05:00.100
Take the quarter.
Such a fucking hurry.

05:09.141 --> 05:10.141
Shit.

05:10.141 --> 05:13.141
Mr. Boyle, your license
has been revoked.

05:13.141 --> 05:17.141
You're driving without a license,
registration or insurance.

05:17.141 --> 05:21.141
You've got four outstanding speeding
tickets, all gone to warrant.

05:21.141 --> 05:24.141
You've got 43 unpaid parking tickets.

05:24.141 --> 05:27.141
- Jesus.
- Nothing is legal about your car.

05:27.141 --> 05:30.141
- Even your press card is out-of-date.
- Out-of-date?

05:30.141 --> 05:32.141
- Damn.
- I'm taking you in.

05:32.141 --> 05:36.141
No... Oh, I'm not that Richard Boyle.

05:36.141 --> 05:38.141
This happens all the time.

05:38.141 --> 05:41.141
- There's another Richard...
- Give me your other hand.

05:41.141 --> 05:45.099
Have some humanity, officer.
I just...

05:47.141 --> 05:49.141
You, come here. You, come on.

05:49.141 --> 05:52.141
Back up.

05:52.141 --> 05:56.141
- Thanks for getting me out.
- Come on and get your car.

05:56.141 --> 05:59.141
Look, they got Bagel.
The Nazis busted Bagel.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.141
They're gonna gas him. Get your car.

06:01.141 --> 06:04.141
I don't have my car, Doc,
I need $75 to get it out.

06:04.141 --> 06:08.141
Shit, I just paid $125
to get you out!

06:08.141 --> 06:09.141
Stop whining.

06:09.141 --> 06:11.141
- Here, this is all I got.
- Thank you.

06:11.141 --> 06:13.141
Come on before they
drop the pellet.

06:13.141 --> 06:15.141
It's just a fucking dog.

06:15.141 --> 06:19.099
It's my dog!

06:20.141 --> 06:22.141
Faster, Richie, will you?

06:22.141 --> 06:25.141
I don't even have a license.
They'll throw away the key.

06:25.141 --> 06:28.141
- How long has he been there?
- I don't know.

06:28.141 --> 06:30.141
I left him with shit friends.

06:30.141 --> 06:33.141
They're not gonna gas
the poor dog, okay?

06:33.141 --> 06:37.141
Everything's turned to shit,
Miriam's thrown me out, man.

06:37.141 --> 06:39.141
She says I'm too old
to be a disc jockey.

06:39.141 --> 06:43.141
She wants me to sell computers in
Silicon Valley, you believe that?

06:43.141 --> 06:45.141
I can't take these yuppie women.

06:45.141 --> 06:48.141
With the Walkmans and
the running shoes...

06:48.141 --> 06:51.141
...and the "rather go to aerobics
than fuck," forget about it.

06:51.141 --> 06:53.141
They got pussy exercises too.

06:53.141 --> 06:56.141
Latin women, they're
totally different.

06:56.141 --> 06:58.141
They're kind and understanding.

06:58.141 --> 07:01.141
Look at Claudia. She doesn't
give a shit what I do...

07:01.141 --> 07:02.141
- Yeah.
- Primo.

07:02.141 --> 07:05.141
Best thing about them is
they don't speak English.

07:05.141 --> 07:08.141
Richie, can I crash at
your place tonight?

07:08.141 --> 07:12.099
I got no place to go. I'll sleep in
the shower, toilet, doesn't matter.

07:13.141 --> 07:17.141
Light up another joint, Doc.
I got some bad news.

07:17.141 --> 07:18.141
- I don't got a place.
- Huh?

07:18.141 --> 07:22.141
We're evicted. We were gonna
stay with you and... Bosco.

07:22.141 --> 07:23.141
- Bagel?
- Bagel.

07:23.141 --> 07:27.141
You mean I gave you my last $200
and I got no place to stay?

07:27.141 --> 07:28.141
- Hey, Doc...
- That's great.

07:28.141 --> 07:31.141
Now what am I supposed to do?
I'm in deep shit.

07:31.141 --> 07:34.141
Man, I should've just
left you in jail.

07:34.141 --> 07:36.141
Move over, move over!

07:36.141 --> 07:39.141
Another yuppie
in a fucking Oldsmobile.

07:39.141 --> 07:42.141
This town is full of goddamn yuppies.

07:42.141 --> 07:46.099
Yuppie town!

07:50.141 --> 07:52.141
Bagel!

07:52.141 --> 07:54.141
Bagel?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.141
Where's my dog?

07:55.141 --> 07:59.141
What does he look like?

07:59.141 --> 08:03.141
- Oh, yeah, I know this dog.
- Where is he?

08:03.141 --> 08:04.141
- Bagel!
- Excuse me.

08:04.141 --> 08:07.141
Sir? Excuse me.

08:07.141 --> 08:09.141
No, that's not your dog.

08:09.141 --> 08:11.141
We had to put your dog to sleep.

08:11.141 --> 08:14.141
We keep the dogs around 14 days.
We kept him more.

08:14.141 --> 08:17.141
- You put him to sleep?
- Yeah.

08:17.141 --> 08:19.141
When's he going to wake up?

08:19.141 --> 08:22.141
You killed him, didn't you?
You gassed him.

08:22.141 --> 08:25.141
We gave him an injection.
It's much more humane...

08:25.141 --> 08:27.141
What kind of humanity is that?

08:27.141 --> 08:29.141
You're a murderer, you know that?

08:29.141 --> 08:31.141
I can't believe it.

08:31.141 --> 08:34.140
That was my only relationship,
my best friend. Seven years.

08:34.140 --> 08:37.140
My marriage only lasted five.

08:37.140 --> 08:40.140
- It's not just!
- I'm really sorry.

08:40.140 --> 08:43.140
Would you like some puppies?

08:43.140 --> 08:45.141
- My dog's leash.
- I'm sorry.

08:45.141 --> 08:49.141
Doc, she can't do anything.
Now come on, okay?

08:49.141 --> 08:53.099
All right?

08:55.141 --> 08:56.141
What's it say?

08:56.141 --> 09:00.141
"Fuck you" in Italian.

09:00.141 --> 09:04.099
Shit, she's gone back to Italy
to her parents, goddamn it.

09:10.141 --> 09:12.141
That's too bad, Richie.

09:12.141 --> 09:16.099
Well, at least she left the TV.

09:22.141 --> 09:26.141
It was a marriage made in hell.

09:26.141 --> 09:29.141
I'm sure gonna miss my boy.

09:29.141 --> 09:31.141
Maybe she'll be back.

09:31.141 --> 09:33.141
Sure.

09:33.141 --> 09:37.099
Who could leave all this?

09:41.141 --> 09:43.141
- Where we going now?
- Guatemala.

09:43.141 --> 09:44.141
- Where we going now?
- Guatemala.

09:44.141 --> 09:46.141
Why?

09:46.141 --> 09:48.141
Why not?

09:48.141 --> 09:52.141
No cops, no laws, sun, it's cheap.

09:52.141 --> 09:56.099
No yuppies. Great dope.

09:59.141 --> 10:03.141
Look at you, will you? You are like
a walking museum of the '60s.

10:03.141 --> 10:04.141
What the fuck are you?

10:04.141 --> 10:07.141
I'm a forward-thinking human being.

10:07.141 --> 10:09.141
I know about life.
I explore things.

10:09.141 --> 10:11.141
Being a journalist,
you're in touch with reality.

10:11.141 --> 10:15.141
You come off with this journalism
bullshit all the time, you know that?

10:15.141 --> 10:18.141
I haven't seen one goddamn article
that you've written.

10:18.141 --> 10:20.141
I wrote a book.
Flower of the Dragon.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.141
Flower of the Dragon
was ten years ago!

10:22.141 --> 10:24.141
It was a big exposé.

10:24.141 --> 10:26.141
Ten years ago.
What have you written since?

10:26.141 --> 10:29.141
What are you talking about?
I've written articles.

10:29.141 --> 10:33.141
I have one in a newspaper
in El Salvador about guerillas.

10:33.141 --> 10:37.141
Oh, the one in El Salvador?
I read that, my whole family read it.

10:37.141 --> 10:41.141
Everyone saw that article, Boyle.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.141
You said Guatemala, man,
not El Salvador.

10:44.141 --> 10:47.141
Come on, I've never been
out of the country.

10:47.141 --> 10:49.141
They kill people here, Boyle.

10:49.141 --> 10:51.141
You believe everything in the papers?

10:51.141 --> 10:52.141
You'll love it here.

10:52.141 --> 10:54.141
Give me the joint.

10:54.141 --> 10:56.141
This is my last chance, man.
I'm serious.

10:56.141 --> 11:00.141
If I can get some good combat
shots for AP, I can make some money.

11:00.141 --> 11:04.141
- I could pay you back.
- Better pay me back.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.141
We'll head for La Libertad...

11:06.141 --> 11:07.141
...the best surfing beach
in the world.

11:07.141 --> 11:11.141
Good times, kick back for a few
months. It'll be fantastic.

11:11.141 --> 11:14.141
You could live in this country
for 300 bucks a year.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.141
- What the fuck is this?
- Mace.

11:16.141 --> 11:19.141
- Mace? For what?
- Wild dogs.

11:19.141 --> 11:23.141
Yeah, wild dogs? That's bullshit.
You've lied to me straight through.

11:23.141 --> 11:26.141
Want me to be honest with you?

11:26.141 --> 11:28.141
What are you doing with all these?

11:28.141 --> 11:31.141
- Here you could have a life.
- What are all these?

11:31.141 --> 11:33.141
They come in handy.

11:33.141 --> 11:35.141
You're gonna love it here, Doc.

11:35.141 --> 11:38.141
- I'm going home, man.
- You can drive drunk...

11:38.141 --> 11:41.141
...and get anybody killed for $50.
- I don't want to.

11:41.141 --> 11:45.141
The best pussy in the world.

11:45.141 --> 11:49.099
Where else can you get a virgin
to sit on your face for seven bucks?

11:50.141 --> 11:53.141
Seven bucks.

11:53.141 --> 11:56.141
It better be the best pussy
in the world...

11:56.141 --> 11:59.141
...or I'm going home.
- Two virgins for 12.

11:59.141 --> 12:02.141
You're just lucky I'm fucked up,
you know that?

12:02.141 --> 12:06.141
Drugs? No prescriptions. They got
stuff that keeps you hard all night.

12:06.141 --> 12:08.141
All these people want to do is fuck.

12:08.141 --> 12:10.141
Twelve bucks?

12:10.141 --> 12:12.141
I think we can get them down.

12:12.141 --> 12:15.140
- Now you're talking.
- You're such an asshole, Boyle.

12:15.140 --> 12:19.099
You're gonna love this place.

12:20.140 --> 12:23.140
You're gonna be in pig heaven, man.

12:23.140 --> 12:26.140
- Why are they blocking the road?
- Don't ask.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.140
This ain't gringo-land.

12:27.140 --> 12:31.140
Here, take this, be dumb,
act cool, all right?

12:31.140 --> 12:33.140
Is this some kind of tranquillizer?

12:33.140 --> 12:35.140
Yeah, permanent one. Cyanide.

12:35.140 --> 12:38.140
You're gonna be sorry
when they cut off your balls...

12:38.140 --> 12:40.140
...and stuff one in each ear.

12:40.140 --> 12:44.099
You're so fucking dramatic, man.
Jesus!

12:46.140 --> 12:48.140
Who are these clowns?

12:48.140 --> 12:52.099
- What the fuck?
- Traffic accident.

12:53.140 --> 12:57.140
Jesus, Boyle.

12:57.140 --> 13:01.140
- Oh God, man!
- Relax, man, it's just some guy.

13:01.140 --> 13:05.140
Shit.

13:05.140 --> 13:07.140
The road to Santa Ana is closed.

13:07.140 --> 13:11.099
I understand, but Colonel Figueroa
told me to give a present to you boys.

13:15.140 --> 13:19.099
They're journalists.

13:21.140 --> 13:25.099
Get out of the car.

13:29.140 --> 13:32.140
Whatever you do, Doc,
whatever you do...

13:32.140 --> 13:34.140
...don't get on the ground.

13:34.140 --> 13:37.140
Jesus Christ, man, this is scary.

13:37.140 --> 13:41.099
I can't believe this, man.

13:59.140 --> 14:03.099
I'm a friend of Colonel Figueroa...

14:04.140 --> 14:08.140
- Friends of Figueroa.
- I'm a friend of Figueroa's.

14:08.140 --> 14:12.099
Is that bad?

14:17.140 --> 14:20.140
He's a friend of Figueroa's.

14:20.140 --> 14:24.099
Shut up!

14:50.140 --> 14:52.140
What's going on here, man?

14:52.140 --> 14:54.140
I think they're checking cédulas.

14:54.140 --> 14:56.140
What's a cédula?

14:56.140 --> 14:58.140
Birth certificates, voting papers.

14:58.140 --> 15:02.099
If you don't have a cédula,
you're in deep shit.

15:18.140 --> 15:22.099
Put your hands on your head.

15:29.140 --> 15:33.099
We've stopped a truck load
of suspicious campesinos.

15:44.140 --> 15:48.098
He's probably a student,
the worst thing you can be.

15:54.140 --> 15:56.140
Why did you leave your papers at home?

15:56.140 --> 16:00.098
I always leave them there.
Please, sir.

16:02.140 --> 16:06.098
Look, I'm a friend
of Colonel Figueroa's.

16:07.140 --> 16:11.098
Fucking ridiculous. I should've never
bailed you out of jail, man.

16:12.140 --> 16:15.140
- Who are your friends?
- Communists!

16:15.140 --> 16:19.098
Take off your glasses.

16:23.140 --> 16:25.140
Oh, shit.

16:25.140 --> 16:29.098
Holy shit! They're gonna fucking
kill us now, Boyle.

16:30.140 --> 16:32.140
I thought you knew your way around.

16:32.140 --> 16:35.140
They're gonna kill us now,
aren't they?!

16:35.140 --> 16:37.140
They're gonna fucking kill us!

16:37.140 --> 16:40.140
Shut the fuck up! Just be cool!

16:40.140 --> 16:44.098
I don't know what they're gonna do.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.140
This is it.

16:52.140 --> 16:56.140
This is it.

16:56.140 --> 17:00.098
You got any of those
tranquillizers left?

18:07.140 --> 18:08.140
COLONEL JULIO FIGUEROA

18:08.140 --> 18:10.140
Commander 3rd Brigade, Infantry
Santa Ana Garrison

18:10.140 --> 18:13.140
How the hell did you get in here?

18:13.140 --> 18:14.140
No periodistas are allowed.

18:14.140 --> 18:18.140
I snuck in through Guatemala, colonel.

18:18.140 --> 18:22.140
You're lucky you've got your huevos,
you know that?

18:22.140 --> 18:26.098
You look like shit.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.140
Come with me.

18:29.140 --> 18:32.140
You wash up.

18:32.140 --> 18:35.140
You got some drinks, some food.

18:35.140 --> 18:39.098
We got some nice tight pussy.

18:43.140 --> 18:45.140
For my amigo here...

18:45.140 --> 18:48.140
...he write me up
in the American newspaper...

18:48.140 --> 18:51.140
...like the Patton of El Salvador.

18:51.140 --> 18:54.140
You were. It was the last
great cavalry charge in history:

18:54.140 --> 18:58.140
Your Soccer War with Honduras, '69.

18:58.140 --> 19:00.140
All the way to Tegucigalpa.

19:00.140 --> 19:04.140
Not since Attila the Hun have there
been such amazing cavalry tactics.

19:04.140 --> 19:07.140
This one takes it up the culo
real nice.

19:07.140 --> 19:10.140
How about this one?
She take it up the culo too?

19:10.140 --> 19:14.140
All right.

19:14.140 --> 19:17.140
Libertad, Doc.
End of the rainbow.

19:17.140 --> 19:18.140
I'm sick.

19:18.140 --> 19:21.140
My asshole hurts, my dick burns...

19:21.140 --> 19:25.140
You know, Richie,
I don't know how to say this...

19:25.140 --> 19:28.140
...but it's been fun
traveling with you.

19:28.140 --> 19:30.140
I'd like to catch a plane out.

19:30.140 --> 19:32.140
Do you think you're gonna die?

19:32.140 --> 19:34.140
I got the best doctor in town.

19:34.140 --> 19:38.098
You have nothing to worry about
once you get the shot.

19:46.140 --> 19:48.140
It's a joke, it's a joke.

19:48.140 --> 19:50.140
- What the hell's she laughing at?
- Nothing.

19:50.140 --> 19:53.140
Everything in there
will clean you out.

19:53.140 --> 19:54.140
If it doesn't, it'll kill you.

19:54.140 --> 19:58.140
- What about a subscription?
- All you need is an ass.

19:58.140 --> 20:00.140
Don't pay her. I got credit here.

20:00.140 --> 20:02.140
I gotta run.

20:02.140 --> 20:04.140
That's a big fucking needle!

20:04.140 --> 20:06.140
Now, come on, please.
Just give me...

20:06.140 --> 20:10.098
Son of a bitch!

20:34.140 --> 20:38.098
Ricardo! Ricardo!

20:42.140 --> 20:46.098
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?

21:03.140 --> 21:06.140
What a pretty girl.

21:06.140 --> 21:10.140
They said you were dead.

21:10.140 --> 21:12.140
Where's her father?

21:12.140 --> 21:16.098
Disappeared.

21:17.140 --> 21:20.140
Let's go to the house.

21:20.140 --> 21:23.140
You still drunk? You still crazy?

21:23.140 --> 21:27.098
No, for you I stopped.
No more alcohol.

22:11.140 --> 22:15.140
At the casa,
we'll see the television.

22:15.140 --> 22:18.140
I know you have another woman
in the north.

22:18.140 --> 22:22.098
Another woman?

22:55.139 --> 22:59.098
Is that you, Major Max?

23:10.139 --> 23:14.098
You back from the dead, man?

23:15.139 --> 23:19.098
I like your friend, Dr. Rock.

23:21.139 --> 23:23.139
How bad is it here?

23:23.139 --> 23:26.139
If I had one of those,
I'd be a little better off.

23:26.139 --> 23:29.139
You gotta be good-looking and rich.

23:29.139 --> 23:33.098
- If you have a woman you have it made.
- My ass hurts.

23:38.139 --> 23:42.098
- Ricardo, can I have some?
- Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.

23:49.139 --> 23:53.098
Yeah, yeah, Guatemala gold.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.139
Driving down this road,
isn't it beautiful?

24:02.139 --> 24:04.139
You want to go back home?

24:04.139 --> 24:06.139
Everywhere I turn...

24:06.139 --> 24:09.139
...dogs screwing other dogs...

24:09.139 --> 24:13.139
...pigs in the street, it's like
Baltimore, for chrissake.

24:13.139 --> 24:15.139
How are we for cash?

24:15.139 --> 24:16.139
You hungry? Want a hamburger?

24:16.139 --> 24:19.139
Maybe just one before you take me
to the airport.

24:19.139 --> 24:22.139
I mean, I got a life there,
even without Miriam.

24:22.139 --> 24:26.139
I bailed you out of jail, you owe me
a lot of money over the years...

24:26.139 --> 24:30.098
...I wish you'd pay me so we can,
like, part company, you know?

24:36.139 --> 24:38.139
- John.
- Rick!

24:38.139 --> 24:40.139
I thought I'd find you here.

24:40.139 --> 24:42.139
- I thought you were dead.
- Do I look that bad?

24:42.139 --> 24:46.139
Yes. I heard stories from Guatemala.

24:46.139 --> 24:48.139
They pulled your toenails out...

24:48.139 --> 24:50.139
Fucking Guatemala. Jesus.

24:50.139 --> 24:54.139
- How was Beirut?
- Fucking awful.

24:54.139 --> 24:56.139
You gonna eat those fries?

24:56.139 --> 24:59.139
Dr. Rock, John Cassady.

24:59.139 --> 25:00.139
Thanks.

25:00.139 --> 25:04.098
That was a great cover
for Newsweek, John.

25:05.139 --> 25:08.139
What happened?
How come you split so fast?

25:08.139 --> 25:10.139
What, from here? I had a beef
with Major Max's boys.

25:10.139 --> 25:13.139
They weren't happy about the
torture chamber story.

25:13.139 --> 25:14.139
Waiter!

25:14.139 --> 25:16.139
Major Max?

25:16.139 --> 25:18.139
Who's Major Max?

25:18.139 --> 25:21.139
This guy's after you too,
on top of everything else?

25:21.139 --> 25:23.139
That was a year ago.
They don't have computers.

25:23.139 --> 25:26.139
- Get out of here.
- I'm getting out.

25:26.139 --> 25:29.139
First plane, I'm gone.
I'm not kidding this time.

25:29.139 --> 25:31.139
Get the fuck out of here!

25:31.139 --> 25:32.139
I want my money, Boyle.

25:32.139 --> 25:35.139
- What money?
- I want the money you owe me.

25:35.139 --> 25:39.139
- No bullshit!
- You're on drugs. There is no money!

25:39.139 --> 25:42.139
The transmission in Guatemala,
gas, whores, the border ripoff.

25:42.139 --> 25:45.139
You know at the border
we had 70 colones?

25:45.139 --> 25:47.139
You know how many we got left? 12.

25:47.139 --> 25:50.139
How much is 12 colones?

25:50.139 --> 25:54.139
- Four bucks. Three bucks.
- Three American dollars?!

25:54.139 --> 25:56.139
That's all we got left?

25:56.139 --> 25:58.139
My dog is dead, Boyle.

25:58.139 --> 26:01.139
Stop doing that!
You know why he's doing that?

26:01.139 --> 26:03.139
This is why. He drinks Tic Tack.

26:03.139 --> 26:05.139
It's 17 cents a bottle.

26:05.139 --> 26:07.139
You can't get rid of the guy.

26:07.139 --> 26:10.139
He'll follow you anywhere.
Want to go to Beirut?

26:10.139 --> 26:12.139
Tell me what it has to do with me.

26:12.139 --> 26:14.139
It's your yuppie liberal bullshit...

26:14.139 --> 26:17.139
It has nothing the fuck
to do with me, man!

26:17.139 --> 26:20.139
I'm stuck in the middle
of his fucking country, man.

26:20.139 --> 26:24.139
I got the shits and I only got
three fucking dollars!

26:24.139 --> 26:26.139
I gotta get out of here, man!

26:26.139 --> 26:28.139
Fuck you, Boyle. Fuck you.

26:28.139 --> 26:30.139
Fuck you!

26:30.139 --> 26:33.139
Fuck you!

26:33.139 --> 26:37.097
He was this hitchhiker
I picked up in Guatemala.

26:40.139 --> 26:42.139
Look, John, I'm really sorry...

26:42.139 --> 26:44.139
It's on Newsweek.

26:44.139 --> 26:47.139
You want me to be honest with you?

26:47.139 --> 26:51.139
I got fired by PNS, okay?
And I could use a string real bad.

26:51.139 --> 26:54.139
- Could you help?
- There's no work here.

26:54.139 --> 26:57.139
- Nobody cares about this war.
- I care.

26:57.139 --> 26:59.139
They're not just shooting the Indians.

26:59.139 --> 27:03.139
Last week a Mexican TV guy
got blown away...

27:03.139 --> 27:06.139
...by their paramilitary groups.

27:06.139 --> 27:10.139
They're shooting at us.

27:10.139 --> 27:13.139
- Why don't you try Angola?
- It's got no nightlife.

27:13.139 --> 27:15.139
Hey, I can get you in with Figueroa.

27:15.139 --> 27:18.139
I got carte blanche
with his elite unit.

27:18.139 --> 27:20.139
You still got the death-mobile.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.139
Come on, Boyle.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.139
Want to go out on dawn patrol?

27:23.139 --> 27:27.097
Or are you too big
of a media star these days?

27:30.139 --> 27:32.139
- Let's go.
- All right.

27:32.139 --> 27:34.139
EL PLAYON
Dump site for death squad victims

27:34.139 --> 27:38.139
You haven't looked through
a lens in a while.

27:38.139 --> 27:42.097
Take some pictures.
There's fresh bodies up there.

27:46.139 --> 27:48.139
Have you got...

27:48.139 --> 27:52.097
...a 24 or a 28 I could use?

28:25.139 --> 28:29.097
You know what made photographers
like Robert Capa great, Rich?

28:30.139 --> 28:33.139
They weren't after money.

28:33.139 --> 28:37.097
They captured the nobility
of human suffering.

28:38.139 --> 28:40.139
That was a great shot in Spain.

28:40.139 --> 28:42.139
One flying through the air.

28:42.139 --> 28:45.139
Yeah, but it was more
than a body, Richie.

28:45.139 --> 28:47.139
He got...

28:47.139 --> 28:50.139
...why they died.

28:50.139 --> 28:54.097
That's what Capa caught.
He caught that moment of death.

28:57.139 --> 28:59.139
You're right up there with him.

28:59.139 --> 29:03.139
You're the best.

29:03.139 --> 29:05.139
You gotta get close, Rich...

29:05.139 --> 29:08.139
...to get the truth.

29:08.139 --> 29:12.097
You get too close, you die.

29:13.139 --> 29:15.139
Someday...

29:15.139 --> 29:19.097
...I want a shot like Capa.

29:21.139 --> 29:25.097
Someday.

29:31.139 --> 29:35.139
Someday.

29:35.139 --> 29:38.139
I gotta go, man.

29:38.139 --> 29:42.139
We gotta go.

29:42.139 --> 29:46.097
I don't have to tell you
to watch yourself, do I?

29:47.139 --> 29:51.139
Alvarez's people are staked out
at the Cathedral, nowadays.

29:51.139 --> 29:53.139
I'll talk to him for you.

29:53.139 --> 29:55.139
And Tom Kelly's the new ambassador.

29:55.139 --> 29:58.139
- From Cambodia?
- You should check him out.

29:58.139 --> 30:00.139
I know him. He's a good man.

30:00.139 --> 30:04.139
There's gonna be a party at the
embassy on Tuesday for the election.

30:04.139 --> 30:06.139
John, thanks.

30:06.139 --> 30:10.097
Cambodia was something, huh?

30:27.139 --> 30:29.139
RAMON ALVAREZ
Director of Human Rights Office...

30:29.139 --> 30:33.097
...and spokesman for the
Revolutionary Democratic Front

30:36.139 --> 30:40.097
MAIN CATHEDRAL
San Salvador

30:42.139 --> 30:44.139
What's going on here?

30:44.139 --> 30:48.097
This is where people find out
about the disappeared.

30:52.139 --> 30:56.139
- What did he say?
- These people are from a land co-op.

30:56.139 --> 30:58.139
They were evicted by police,
so they're on strike.

30:58.139 --> 31:00.139
I saw that in Zapata.

31:00.139 --> 31:03.139
Carmen!

31:03.139 --> 31:06.139
Carmen Sanchez. Hey, it's Ricardo.

31:06.139 --> 31:10.097
Hi, how are you?

31:18.139 --> 31:21.139
Ramon?

31:21.139 --> 31:25.097
Did John Cassady talk to you
about my going out with the guerillas?

31:29.139 --> 31:33.097
Ramon, I need a break and I did a
good story on you last year, remember?

31:34.139 --> 31:36.139
Look, I'm not a travel agency
for you guys.

31:36.139 --> 31:40.097
I know, but if Max takes power, you'll
need good press. I'd like to help.

31:41.139 --> 31:43.139
Good press.

31:43.139 --> 31:44.139
There are 10,000 disappeared...

31:44.139 --> 31:48.139
...and every day the list grows,
and you pendejo...

31:48.139 --> 31:52.097
...talk about good press.

31:54.139 --> 31:56.139
Ramon...

31:56.139 --> 31:59.139
...I got some shots this morning
and maybe they can help you...

31:59.139 --> 32:03.097
...from El Playon. I'm sorry, okay?

32:06.139 --> 32:10.139
To the mountains?

32:10.139 --> 32:12.139
Come back next week. I arrange it.

32:12.139 --> 32:16.097
Oh, God. Thank you, Carmen.

32:21.139 --> 32:22.139
Sister Stan?

32:22.139 --> 32:25.139
- Hi, how you doing?
- Oh, fine.

32:25.139 --> 32:27.139
- It's good to see you back.
- Good to see you.

32:27.139 --> 32:29.139
Cathy's around somewhere.

32:29.139 --> 32:31.139
You look awfully busy.

32:31.139 --> 32:34.139
Yes. Parents missing, dead, lost.

32:34.139 --> 32:38.139
These are some survivors from
the massacre at the Sempa River.

32:38.139 --> 32:41.139
I heard government helicopters
fired as they crossed.

32:41.139 --> 32:43.139
It's very bad now. Very bad.

32:43.139 --> 32:44.139
It's very bad now. Very bad.

32:44.139 --> 32:48.097
Madness on both sides.

32:50.139 --> 32:52.139
Cathy Moore.

32:52.139 --> 32:54.139
The prettiest Colleen
in all of El Salvador.

32:54.139 --> 32:57.139
What are you doing here,
you degenerate?

32:57.139 --> 33:00.139
Back to see old girlfriends
at the Noa Noa?

33:00.139 --> 33:04.139
- You ruined that by converting them.
- I try.

33:04.139 --> 33:06.139
Need a ride to La Libertad tomorrow?

33:06.139 --> 33:10.097
I can't, I got too much to do
around here.

33:12.139 --> 33:13.138
Fudge!

33:13.138 --> 33:16.138
It's the wrong piece!
It's for an elbow!

33:16.138 --> 33:20.138
I told Cleveland!
It happens every time! They promised.

33:20.138 --> 33:24.138
Come on, Cathy. We'll have
another shipment next month.

33:24.138 --> 33:26.138
Anisetta can wait.

33:26.138 --> 33:28.138
Can't you, darling?

33:28.138 --> 33:30.138
One... two...

33:30.138 --> 33:33.138
...three... four...

33:33.138 --> 33:34.138
...five.

33:34.138 --> 33:38.097
Now you can go to any urban city
and you can make it.

33:40.138 --> 33:44.138
Try to halt the infiltration
into the Americas...

33:44.138 --> 33:47.138
...by terrorists,
by outside interference...

33:47.138 --> 33:50.138
...and those who aren't
just aiming at El Salvador...

33:50.138 --> 33:54.138
...but I think are aiming at...

33:54.138 --> 33:57.138
...the whole of Central and
possibly later, South America...

33:57.138 --> 34:01.097
...and, I'm sure,
eventually North America.

34:20.138 --> 34:21.138
Can you believe that...

34:21.138 --> 34:25.097
...the straight man to a chimpanzee
will be the next president of the U.S.?

34:26.138 --> 34:28.138
I mean, doesn't that depress you?

34:28.138 --> 34:29.138
- Know what depresses me?
- What?

34:29.138 --> 34:32.138
- You!
- I can accept that.

34:32.138 --> 34:35.138
I can't! This is like a gig.
I'm trying to make money.

34:35.138 --> 34:38.138
How can I, with you
yakking and hobbling around?

34:38.138 --> 34:42.138
Go get something to eat or go to
the pool and meet girls, will you?

34:42.138 --> 34:44.138
- Stay out of my face!
- Okay, I'm easy.

34:44.138 --> 34:47.138
Yakking all the time.

34:47.138 --> 34:51.138
...going for Ronald Reagan.

34:51.138 --> 34:53.138
- Morgan.
- I thought you were dead.

34:53.138 --> 34:57.138
What brings you here?
Reagan planning ahead?

34:57.138 --> 34:58.138
Colonel Hyde, remember me?

34:58.138 --> 35:00.138
COLONEL BENTLEY HYDE
Senior Officer MILGROUP

35:00.138 --> 35:02.138
U.S. Advisor Salvador Military

35:02.138 --> 35:05.138
- Pacific News Service, Vietnam?
- Bob Samuels, USAID.

35:05.138 --> 35:06.138
How do you do?

35:06.138 --> 35:09.138
Millicent Davies, US AFL-CIO.

35:09.138 --> 35:11.138
Remember me, sir?

35:11.138 --> 35:12.138
Yeah, I remember.

35:12.138 --> 35:16.138
Last time I heard about you
was when Thieu kicked you out.

35:16.138 --> 35:19.138
Then Mr. Thieu
got kicked out after me.

35:19.138 --> 35:22.138
I never understood why you guys
like the Commies so much.

35:22.138 --> 35:24.138
"We guys."

35:24.138 --> 35:28.138
If you were Vietnamese, you'd be in a
reeducation camp pulling turnips.

35:28.138 --> 35:30.138
I never really liked turnips very much.

35:30.138 --> 35:33.138
And I'm not applying
for Vietnamese citizenship.

35:33.138 --> 35:37.097
They don't like that funny stuff
you smoke, old buddy.

35:38.138 --> 35:39.138
Why, you got some?

35:39.138 --> 35:43.138
Colonel, let me ask you something.
It's a big favor.

35:43.138 --> 35:47.097
You think you could get me out
on a Cazadore op?

35:48.138 --> 35:51.138
If I get you out...

35:51.138 --> 35:54.138
...what's in it for me?

35:54.138 --> 35:56.138
These guys never change.

35:56.138 --> 35:58.138
Vietnam. You know, Vietnam.

35:58.138 --> 36:01.138
I mean, are we gonna
invade here or what?

36:01.138 --> 36:04.138
I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:04.138 --> 36:05.138
I was young during all that.

36:05.138 --> 36:09.138
Look, I'm not supposed
to talk to the press, okay?

36:09.138 --> 36:12.138
And you're weird. So fuck off.

36:12.138 --> 36:14.138
I'm not the press.

36:14.138 --> 36:17.138
JACK MORGAN
U.S. State Department Analyst

36:17.138 --> 36:19.138
- Go with the guerillas?
- With anybody.

36:19.138 --> 36:23.138
The National Guard, the muchachos...
Want a drink? Yeah, you do.

36:23.138 --> 36:25.138
Something big is in the wind.

36:25.138 --> 36:28.138
Rebels are getting weapons
through Nicaragua.

36:28.138 --> 36:32.097
They'll make a move soon, so any news
or photos you could throw my way...

36:33.138 --> 36:36.138
No, that's stuff's hard to prove
and I hate doing that.

36:36.138 --> 36:39.138
I'm not asking you to spook.
Just show them to me first.

36:39.138 --> 36:41.138
You'll publish them anyway.

36:41.138 --> 36:45.138
I hear they're getting it from the
black market, from government troops...

36:45.138 --> 36:48.138
Last year.
This year Castro's got them organized.

36:48.138 --> 36:52.138
I'm not messing around.
This is all Warsaw bloc stuff.

36:52.138 --> 36:55.138
Jesus. Same old "Black Jack" Morgan.

36:55.138 --> 36:59.138
You won't think it's a joke
when they take this place.

36:59.138 --> 37:03.138
Nicaragua was just the beginning.
Guatemala and Honduras are next.

37:03.138 --> 37:06.138
In five years you'll
see Cuban tanks on the Rio Grande.

37:06.138 --> 37:10.096
Give me a break. I'm more worried
about Major Max on the Rio Grande.

37:11.138 --> 37:13.138
Major Max may be
running things here soon.

37:13.138 --> 37:16.138
So you'd better watch yourself, sport.

37:16.138 --> 37:18.138
Jesus. Hey, could you
lend me 50 bucks?

37:18.138 --> 37:20.138
- What?
- 50 bucks.

37:20.138 --> 37:22.138
Tom!

37:22.138 --> 37:25.138
Ambassador Kelly, how are you?
I'm Richard Boyle, PNS.

37:25.138 --> 37:28.138
I was the last man out of Cambodia.
After Schamburg.

37:28.138 --> 37:32.138
I wrote Flower of the Dragon.
I'm a friend of Captain Moore's.

37:32.138 --> 37:35.138
THOMAS KELLY
U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador

37:35.138 --> 37:38.138
Ambassador, does this Reagan thing
pose a problem for you?

37:38.138 --> 37:41.138
Let me grab a couple of shots.

37:41.138 --> 37:44.138
General, have you met Mr. Doyle?

37:44.138 --> 37:47.138
Hello. Nice to meet you.
That's Boyle. Boyle.

37:47.138 --> 37:50.138
Thanks.

37:50.138 --> 37:54.096
ABC has projected
the next president...

37:56.138 --> 38:00.096
...Ronald Reagan.

38:04.138 --> 38:08.138
I gotta do a standup at 10,
boiling all this down.

38:08.138 --> 38:10.138
You couldn't go far wrong saying:

38:10.138 --> 38:14.138
"With Reagan in the saddle,
the guerillas are in deep shit."

38:14.138 --> 38:18.138
That's lovely, Peter, but have you
seen the Journal today?

38:18.138 --> 38:22.138
Here. It's real rah-rah democracy,
free elections, all that.

38:22.138 --> 38:25.138
I think it's what
the networks want tonight.

38:25.138 --> 38:28.138
So, what's your sign?

38:28.138 --> 38:29.138
"Stop."

38:29.138 --> 38:31.138
That's really cute.

38:31.138 --> 38:33.138
I thought it was "Slippery When Wet."

38:33.138 --> 38:37.138
This article and you, Pauline,
are 100 percent...

38:37.138 --> 38:39.138
...and unequivocally full of shit.

38:39.138 --> 38:42.138
Who's talking? You're so
full of shit I can't believe it.

38:42.138 --> 38:44.138
- I resent...
- Know what I resent?

38:44.138 --> 38:48.138
- I resent what we saw in Santa Ana.
- What was that?

38:48.138 --> 38:52.138
A kid shot in the head and hung
because he didn't have his cédula.

38:52.138 --> 38:54.138
- Know what a cédula is?
- Yeah.

38:54.138 --> 38:58.138
If you're gonna analyze
a situation, analyze it right.

38:58.138 --> 39:02.138
You don't have a cédula on
election day, stamped, you're dead.

39:02.138 --> 39:05.138
What kind of democracy is it
when you have to vote...

39:05.138 --> 39:08.138
...and if you don't you're branded
a Commie subversivo.

39:08.138 --> 39:11.138
These people would vote
for Donald Duck...

39:11.138 --> 39:14.138
...or whoever the local cop
tells them because if they don't...

39:14.138 --> 39:16.138
...this is what happens.

39:16.138 --> 39:20.096
You're a real pro. That's why you
can't last two weeks with a network.

39:21.138 --> 39:25.096
Yuppies do a standup from the Camino
Real, they think they got the story.

39:26.138 --> 39:27.138
City lights, my ass.

39:27.138 --> 39:30.138
"My Two Weeks in El Salvador"
by Pauline Axelrod.

39:30.138 --> 39:31.138
Oh, yeah.

39:31.138 --> 39:34.138
"Whoring Through El Salvador"
by Richard Boyle.

39:34.138 --> 39:37.138
Never with you,
blowjob queen of New York.

39:37.138 --> 39:41.138
You're kissing all the right asses,
no wonder you're on the networks.

39:41.138 --> 39:44.138
Excuse me.

39:44.138 --> 39:46.138
- Pauline, I'm sorry.
- Fuck off!

39:46.138 --> 39:50.138
Just be a sport. I'm an asshole!

39:50.138 --> 39:53.138
I'm an asshole, all right?

39:53.138 --> 39:56.138
Well, you don't have to worry
about her.

39:56.138 --> 40:00.138
She's gonna boil it down real good.

40:00.138 --> 40:03.138
I put 500 mics of acid
in her drink.

40:03.138 --> 40:07.138
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

40:07.138 --> 40:11.096
With Ronald Reagan
sweeping the elections...

40:12.138 --> 40:16.096
...here at the Camino Real Hotel...

40:30.138 --> 40:32.138
Attention, residents of Escalon.

40:32.138 --> 40:35.138
Ronald Reagan has been
elected President.

40:35.138 --> 40:38.138
Finally, we have someone
in the White House with balls.

40:38.138 --> 40:40.138
MAJOR MAXIMILIANO CASANOVA
(aka Major Max)

40:40.138 --> 40:44.138
Presidential Candidate and Former
Director of Salvadoran Intelligence

40:44.138 --> 40:46.138
The time has come for us, brothers...

40:46.138 --> 40:49.138
...former members of Orden...

40:49.138 --> 40:53.096
...patriots of the
Maximiliano Hernandez Brigade...

40:54.138 --> 40:58.096
...and brothers of La Mano Blanca.

40:59.138 --> 41:03.096
These fucking priests poisoning
the minds of our Salvadoran youth...

41:04.138 --> 41:07.138
...are gonna be the first to bleed.

41:07.138 --> 41:11.138
They are pig shit.

41:11.138 --> 41:15.096
And this Romero
is the biggest pig shit of all.

41:16.138 --> 41:20.096
A shitfaced desecration
of an archbishop.

41:21.138 --> 41:24.138
And with this bullet...

41:24.138 --> 41:28.096
...he will be the first to die.

41:29.138 --> 41:33.096
For every one of our people
we will kill 100 of them.

41:34.138 --> 41:37.138
We will avenge the deaths...

41:37.138 --> 41:41.138
...of the South African ambassador...

41:41.138 --> 41:44.138
...of Foreign Minister
Mauricio Borgenovo...

41:44.138 --> 41:46.138
...of Roberto Cuoma...

41:46.138 --> 41:50.138
...of Colonel Rosario,
of Gutierrez and Molina...

41:50.138 --> 41:53.138
...and of the Mayor of El Paraiso.

41:53.138 --> 41:57.138
These subversives that have sold our
country to the Communists will die.

41:57.138 --> 42:01.096
Erlich, Zaun, Kelly, Duarte,
et cetera, et cetera.

42:05.138 --> 42:09.096
And these pseudo journalists sent
by the Zionist-Communist conspiracy...

42:10.138 --> 42:14.096
...to divide and confuse our people,
they will die.

42:18.138 --> 42:21.138
Now...

42:21.138 --> 42:24.138
...who will be the one...

42:24.138 --> 42:26.138
...among you...

42:26.138 --> 42:30.096
...to rid me of this Romero?

43:00.138 --> 43:04.096
You will be famous.

43:13.138 --> 43:16.138
As you well know...

43:16.138 --> 43:18.138
...I stand for nationalism...

43:18.138 --> 43:21.138
...law and order,
and economic prosperity.

43:21.138 --> 43:23.138
More important...

43:23.138 --> 43:27.138
...I stand for Church and family...

43:27.138 --> 43:31.096
...and a peaceful Salvador.

43:33.138 --> 43:37.096
There you go. You like that?

43:39.138 --> 43:40.138
Yeah, rock 'n' roll.

43:40.138 --> 43:43.137
Your tab is way high.
You owe me 400 colones.

43:43.137 --> 43:45.137
I'm running a restaurant, not a bank.

43:45.137 --> 43:47.137
I know, okay?

43:47.137 --> 43:49.137
I got an NBC radio gig in the works...

43:49.137 --> 43:52.137
...I got a CNN feed tomorrow,
I'm hot again.

43:52.137 --> 43:55.137
Have I ever stiffed you in 10 years?

43:55.137 --> 43:58.137
I'll pay you the whole thing
next week.

43:58.137 --> 44:00.137
Okay. Don't tell Elena.
She'll kill me.

44:00.137 --> 44:04.096
Besides that, could you throw in 100
colones cash, walking around money?

44:05.137 --> 44:07.137
In front of Maria,
I don't want to look like a jerk.

44:07.137 --> 44:11.137
- You're doing it to me again.
- I'll make it 750.

44:11.137 --> 44:12.137
Okay, man.

44:12.137 --> 44:15.137
...who are the masters of deception.

44:15.137 --> 44:19.096
Christian Democrat green
on the outside...

44:22.137 --> 44:25.137
...Moscow red on the inside.

44:25.137 --> 44:29.096
What a clown!

44:30.137 --> 44:32.137
Listen to your conscience.

44:32.137 --> 44:35.137
Who is inflicting more violence?

44:35.137 --> 44:39.096
Terrorists?

44:47.137 --> 44:50.137
Carlos, come on. Get down.

44:50.137 --> 44:54.096
This isn't funny. Come on.

44:56.137 --> 45:00.096
I want to talk to you! Sit down.

45:11.137 --> 45:15.096
It's getting dangerous here.

45:16.137 --> 45:19.137
Yes, we're living in a bad time.

45:19.137 --> 45:23.096
Like 1932 again, I detect
a bad feeling in the air.

45:37.137 --> 45:39.137
This stuff's like white lightening.

45:39.137 --> 45:43.137
You keep drinking that, you'll
end up in the street begging.

45:43.137 --> 45:47.096
I'm not kidding you, you will.

45:59.137 --> 46:03.096
You and your friends are really funny.

46:04.137 --> 46:08.137
Yes, but you'd look better
without your balls.

46:08.137 --> 46:11.137
How 'bout I cut yours off.

46:11.137 --> 46:14.137
Who are you?
Get off the fucking car.

46:14.137 --> 46:18.096
Who are you?
Get off the fucking car.

46:21.137 --> 46:25.096
How about some beers for everybody?

46:28.137 --> 46:32.096
Get in the car, Doc.

46:33.137 --> 46:35.137
Get in the car, Doc.

46:35.137 --> 46:39.096
Let's go to the beach,
I've got my pickup truck.

46:40.137 --> 46:44.096
Me with you? Not even to church.
Why don't you ask your mother?

46:47.137 --> 46:49.137
Hey! What are you doing?

46:49.137 --> 46:53.096
Jesus.

46:56.137 --> 46:58.137
Get in the car.

46:58.137 --> 47:02.137
Doc, get in the car.

47:02.137 --> 47:05.137
Where'd you get all those marks
on your face?

47:05.137 --> 47:09.096
Couldn't keep your hands
off the blackheads in high school?

47:11.137 --> 47:15.095
Could be death squad, got it?
Get in the car.

47:51.137 --> 47:55.095
You can drop me here.

48:01.137 --> 48:02.137
Where are you going?

48:02.137 --> 48:06.137
I'm going with the guerrillas
in the mountains.

48:06.137 --> 48:08.137
What will your parents say?

48:08.137 --> 48:10.137
She knows.

48:10.137 --> 48:13.137
It's not safe here anymore.

48:13.137 --> 48:16.137
I go, okay?

48:16.137 --> 48:20.095
You gonna join them?

48:25.137 --> 48:29.095
In my country, amigo,
there is no more God.

48:32.137 --> 48:36.137
They took Carlos and Dr. Rock!
They saw the marijuana!

48:36.137 --> 48:40.095
Go in the house, I'll take care of it!

48:41.137 --> 48:44.137
What are you talking about?
It's my brother!

48:44.137 --> 48:47.137
I know it's your brother!
I'll take care of it.

48:47.137 --> 48:49.137
Now get in the fucking house!

48:49.137 --> 48:53.095
I'll take care of it!

48:59.137 --> 49:03.095
Fuck!

49:29.137 --> 49:31.137
Get me the fuck out of here!

49:31.137 --> 49:34.137
You want to live? Shut up.

49:34.137 --> 49:38.095
They're marihuanos. Subversives.

50:11.137 --> 50:14.137
Doc, go, go!
Get out of here. Go.

50:14.137 --> 50:15.137
Take him out.

50:15.137 --> 50:18.137
And the other one?

50:18.137 --> 50:20.137
No, he's a bad kid.
No respect.

50:20.137 --> 50:24.095
He stays here.
Or you stay as well.

50:38.137 --> 50:40.137
All right.

50:40.137 --> 50:44.095
Carlos, just stay cool.
I'll get you out.

50:56.137 --> 50:58.137
- Hi, Cathy, how are you?
- I'm fine.

50:58.137 --> 51:00.137
- You look a little tired.
- I'm fine.

51:00.137 --> 51:02.137
- Ambassador, Richard Boyle.
- Sir.

51:02.137 --> 51:04.137
Good to see you again.

51:04.137 --> 51:06.137
- You remember me?
- I certainly do.

51:06.137 --> 51:10.095
I'm sorry, but I had actually written
two articles about you in Cambodia.

51:11.137 --> 51:12.137
- Really?
- "Fall of Phnom Penh."

51:12.137 --> 51:15.137
I was the last American
journalist out.

51:15.137 --> 51:19.137
Schamberg gets his Pulitzer Prize,
and I almost got cholera...

51:19.137 --> 51:23.095
...but we saved 1100 refugees
from the Khmer Rouge.

51:25.137 --> 51:29.137
- Awful, what they did to that country.
- Yes, it was.

51:29.137 --> 51:33.137
Are you one of the people portraying
them as the good guys for a while?

51:33.137 --> 51:35.137
Yes, sir, I'm afraid
I was wrong there.

51:35.137 --> 51:37.137
But a lot of people were.

51:37.137 --> 51:40.137
If these guys running around
the hills took power...

51:40.137 --> 51:43.137
...it'd be much worse than Pol Pot.

51:43.137 --> 51:46.137
Are they as bad as Major Max
and the Mano Blanco?

51:46.137 --> 51:47.137
I don't know.

51:47.137 --> 51:51.095
A killer on the right, God knows what
on the left and a gutless middle.

51:54.137 --> 51:57.137
Boyle, about your problem here...

51:57.137 --> 52:01.137
Carol's checked the National Guard,
the Treasury Police, the Army.

52:01.137 --> 52:04.137
Nobody seems to know anything
about this boy.

52:04.137 --> 52:06.137
- Now we think...
- With all due respect...

52:06.137 --> 52:08.137
...they're lying.

52:08.137 --> 52:12.137
He didn't just disappear. Nobody
disappears here. They got him.

52:12.137 --> 52:15.137
Carol, have you checked Human Rights?

52:15.137 --> 52:19.095
Fuck the Human Rights office! They
rearranged this kid's molecules!

52:20.137 --> 52:23.137
- Richard!
- He's dying out there, those fucks.

52:23.137 --> 52:26.137
He's just a kid!
He's just a kid!

52:26.137 --> 52:29.137
- Richard, please calm down.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

52:29.137 --> 52:32.137
Ambassador, look, his sister...

52:32.137 --> 52:36.137
...she's my girlfriend.
I've gotta get a cédula for her.

52:36.137 --> 52:40.137
They could come tonight, take her away
and kill her too.

52:40.137 --> 52:44.137
Richard! That doesn't have
anything to do with us.

52:44.137 --> 52:46.137
You know the laws here.

52:46.137 --> 52:48.137
She'll have to go back
to her hometown.

52:48.137 --> 52:50.137
- Where's she from?
- Morazon, sir.

52:50.137 --> 52:54.095
If she gets near there, the guards
will kill her as a suspected G. Fuck!

52:56.137 --> 52:59.137
I'll do the best I can,
but it's very tough.

52:59.137 --> 53:03.095
Everybody's in the same boat.
Thousands of people want a cédula.

53:04.137 --> 53:08.137
Let me ask you this:
What if I married her?

53:08.137 --> 53:11.137
Richard, you're already married.

53:11.137 --> 53:14.137
Sir, I know you're busy.
Thank you for your time.

53:14.137 --> 53:17.137
But this is El Salvador.
Suppose I just married her?

53:17.137 --> 53:21.137
- I'll do whatever I can. I will.
- Thank you, sir.

53:21.137 --> 53:25.095
- Maybe you could talk to lmmigration?
- Just let me see what I can do.

53:26.137 --> 53:28.137
Joan and I want to see you
at the Christmas party.

53:28.137 --> 53:32.095
- Maybe I could keep in touch with you?
- Yeah, sure.

53:39.137 --> 53:41.137
- I give up on you.
- What do you mean, give up?

53:41.137 --> 53:45.137
- Every time I try to get something...
- This guy, he liked me.

53:45.137 --> 53:47.137
- What's up?
- I gotta get Maria a cédula.

53:47.137 --> 53:50.137
Maria.

53:50.137 --> 53:54.137
They can't find Carlos, but the
ambassador is personally involved.

53:54.137 --> 53:56.137
The thing is, though...

53:56.137 --> 54:00.095
...you're in danger. Without a cédula
they can grab you, comprende?

54:01.137 --> 54:05.095
So I've been thinking about something,
and what I think we should do...

54:08.137 --> 54:10.137
- Marry me.
- What?

54:10.137 --> 54:12.136
We could have a family.

54:12.136 --> 54:14.136
Duglas and Reina and you and me.

54:14.136 --> 54:18.136
- And Carlos, what about him?
- And Carlos, yes, when we find him.

54:18.136 --> 54:21.136
- Si?
- You already have a wife?

54:21.136 --> 54:25.136
No, that's been over, six months.
I got a divorce. I never told you.

54:25.136 --> 54:28.136
- Hi, Boyle!
- Just a second.

54:28.136 --> 54:30.136
- Hey, Peter.
- Atlanta's giving you a shot.

54:30.136 --> 54:31.136
No!

54:31.136 --> 54:35.136
- If you fuck up this time...
- Not a chance. That's great, man.

54:35.136 --> 54:38.136
I want some real stuff on the G's.

54:38.136 --> 54:41.136
- You set with Alvarez?
- We're like this.

54:41.136 --> 54:44.136
You got the camera, the crew,
and the Arena press conference.

54:44.136 --> 54:47.136
- Right, Major Max.
- He's gonna declare for president.

54:47.136 --> 54:51.136
I'm going to Venezuela, so you'll
have to cover for me.

54:51.136 --> 54:55.136
You're a mensch. Could you lend
me fifty bucks, man? I'm low.

54:55.136 --> 54:58.136
You don't change, do you?

54:58.136 --> 55:00.136
- This is what we got here.
- 100 would...

55:00.136 --> 55:02.136
- 200 of them.
- 200 colones?

55:02.136 --> 55:06.095
Out of my own pocket, so no whores.

55:07.136 --> 55:11.095
- Do a good job, Boyle.
- Peter, you're a mensch, thanks.

55:17.136 --> 55:21.136
- So what?
- I can't marry a divorced man.

55:21.136 --> 55:24.136
And you, Richard,
are a bad Catholic in all ways.

55:24.136 --> 55:26.136
How am I a bad Catholic?

55:26.136 --> 55:28.136
- You're living in sin.
- No, I'm not.

55:28.136 --> 55:31.136
- You drink.
- Okay, sometimes.

55:31.136 --> 55:34.136
You sleep with many women.

55:34.136 --> 55:37.136
- You smoke marijuana.
- No, that was Rock's.

55:37.136 --> 55:41.136
And you lie, you scheme
and you scam.

55:41.136 --> 55:44.136
What is good or decent about you?

55:44.136 --> 55:46.136
What redemption can you expect?

55:46.136 --> 55:50.095
Well, none. Okay, you got a point,
I am a fucking weasel.

55:51.136 --> 55:54.136
But think about this:
If I went to Church...

55:54.136 --> 55:58.095
I haven't been to Church in 30 years,
but we'd go to communion together...

55:59.136 --> 56:02.136
Redemption, it'd be great!
We could go to Archbishop Romero.

56:02.136 --> 56:05.136
He knows me
and likes me very much.

56:05.136 --> 56:09.136
I could become a lay Catholic worker.
It'd be wonderful, I could...

56:09.136 --> 56:13.095
This redemption thing feels good.
I feel cleansed already.

56:14.136 --> 56:18.136
- You want some of this?
- No, no more marijuana.

56:18.136 --> 56:22.095
It's possible Archbishop Romero
could annul my marriage to Claudia.

56:23.136 --> 56:26.136
She was a Commie atheist anyway.

56:26.136 --> 56:29.136
I'm gonna talk to him
about this, seriously.

56:29.136 --> 56:30.136
Very good man.

56:30.136 --> 56:34.095
Man of the people. Man of God.
He could win the Nobel Peace Prize.

56:35.136 --> 56:38.136
Hey, what's this?
Another demonstration, Boyle?

56:38.136 --> 56:42.095
Calm down, take it easy...

56:57.136 --> 57:01.095
Stop-stop, please.

57:02.136 --> 57:05.136
I have orders to evacuate the plaza
in five minutes. Do you understand me?

57:05.136 --> 57:09.136
I have superior orders signed.

57:09.136 --> 57:11.136
Why don't you stop the repression?

57:11.136 --> 57:15.136
No matter... five minutes or violence.

57:15.136 --> 57:17.136
Why don't you do something
about the Disappeared?

57:17.136 --> 57:19.136
Violence! You understand me?

57:19.136 --> 57:23.095
Stop the repression!

57:42.136 --> 57:46.136
Do you follow in the way of Christ?

57:46.136 --> 57:49.136
Not exactly.
I mean, in my heart, yes.

57:49.136 --> 57:53.094
But I've done a lot of, you know...

57:55.136 --> 57:58.136
...carnal sins, and...

57:58.136 --> 58:01.136
...drunk a lot of alcohol,
and done some drugs.

58:01.136 --> 58:05.136
I've weaseled around in my life,
trying to get the edge all the time.

58:05.136 --> 58:08.136
But basically,
I'm a good-hearted person.

58:08.136 --> 58:11.136
I haven't done anything
malicious in my life.

58:11.136 --> 58:14.136
I haven't done anything great either.

58:14.136 --> 58:18.094
I've tried to do things, find truths.
I do love this woman.

58:19.136 --> 58:22.136
- For her, I'd...
- You'd change for this woman.

58:22.136 --> 58:26.094
For this woman I'm willing to change.
I mean not just...

58:27.136 --> 58:30.136
If God gave me this woman...

58:30.136 --> 58:33.136
...then there must be a God.

58:33.136 --> 58:37.094
So if He knows what's right,
then I'd do what's right by Him.

58:38.136 --> 58:41.136
Just repent. Change your ways.

58:41.136 --> 58:45.136
That's gonna be a little tough.

58:45.136 --> 58:48.136
You love this woman,
you will be willing to change.

58:48.136 --> 58:51.136
Okay, I can still drink...

58:51.136 --> 58:55.136
...and take a few hits from a joint
once in a while, right? That's okay?

58:55.136 --> 58:59.094
Twelve Our Fathers, ten Hail Marys,
and an Act of Contrition.

59:00.136 --> 59:01.136
That's it?

59:01.136 --> 59:05.094
Ask the Lord for forgiveness
from your heart.

59:06.136 --> 59:10.094
From my heart.

59:11.136 --> 59:14.136
If I'd known this, I would've come
earlier, before 33 years.

59:14.136 --> 59:16.136
You should've come earlier.

59:16.136 --> 59:20.094
- I'll come back.
- Next time don't wait so long.

59:22.136 --> 59:26.094
The governing junta has good intentions
with their promises of land reform...

59:27.136 --> 59:30.136
and their desire to control...

59:30.136 --> 59:33.136
the so-called paramilitary forces
in the Army.

59:33.136 --> 59:36.136
But, sadly, it is a failure...

59:36.136 --> 59:39.136
because the power within the junta
is the Army...

59:39.136 --> 59:43.094
and the Army itself is an obstacle
to the reign of God.

59:44.136 --> 59:46.136
They know only how to repress
the people...

59:46.136 --> 59:50.094
and defend the interests
of the rich oligarchy.

59:51.136 --> 59:55.136
I have called upon the United States,
repeatedly...

59:55.136 --> 59:59.136
to stop all military aid to this Army...

59:59.136 --> 01:00:03.136
until it satisfactorily resolves
the problems of the Disappeared...

01:00:03.136 --> 01:00:06.136
and submits itself to
civilian control.

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:10.136
When a dictatorship
seriously violates human rights...

01:00:10.136 --> 01:00:13.136
and attacks the common good
of the nation...

01:00:13.136 --> 01:00:17.094
When it becomes unbearable
and closes all channels of dialogue...

01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:21.136
When this happens,
the Church speaks...

01:00:21.136 --> 01:00:25.094
of the legitimate right
of insurrectional violence!

01:00:28.136 --> 01:00:32.094
We are poor.
You in Washington are so rich.

01:00:35.136 --> 01:00:39.094
Why are you so blind?

01:00:41.136 --> 01:00:44.136
My children...

01:00:44.136 --> 01:00:48.136
you must look to yourselves...

01:00:48.136 --> 01:00:52.136
in this sad time for Salvador.

01:00:52.136 --> 01:00:56.094
I wish to close with an appeal
to the men of the Army...

01:00:58.136 --> 01:01:02.094
and in particular, the National Guard.

01:01:05.136 --> 01:01:09.094
Brothers, you are part of your people.

01:01:11.136 --> 01:01:15.094
Yet you kill your own
brothers and sisters.

01:01:17.136 --> 01:01:21.136
But before a man may kill,
the law of God must prevail.

01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:25.094
And that law says,
"Thou shalt not kill."

01:01:26.136 --> 01:01:30.094
No soldier is obliged to obey an order
against the law of God.

01:01:31.136 --> 01:01:35.136
Violence on all sides is wrong.

01:01:35.136 --> 01:01:37.136
Violence is wrong.

01:01:37.136 --> 01:01:41.136
In the name of God, and in the name
of this suffering people...

01:01:41.136 --> 01:01:45.136
Whose laments rise to Heaven
each day more tumultuous...

01:01:45.136 --> 01:01:48.136
I beg you...

01:01:48.136 --> 01:01:49.136
I ask you...

01:01:49.136 --> 01:01:52.136
I order you in the name of God...

01:01:52.136 --> 01:01:56.094
Stop the repression!

01:03:54.136 --> 01:03:58.094
Arrest him for the murder
of Archbishop Romero.

01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:12.094
Taxi! Taxi!

01:04:43.135 --> 01:04:46.135
You will note, I did not agree
with the bishop.

01:04:46.135 --> 01:04:49.135
He sometimes got carried away
with his politics.

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:53.094
He did not understand
that with the Left in power...

01:04:54.135 --> 01:04:57.135
...there will be no Church
in this country.

01:04:57.135 --> 01:05:01.094
And he will be out of a job.

01:05:03.135 --> 01:05:06.135
In my book, it was the subversives
that killed him.

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:10.094
No question. To provoke
this atmosphere, this cause.

01:05:14.135 --> 01:05:18.094
It's rumored that you're head of the
death squads terrorizing the city.

01:05:19.135 --> 01:05:22.135
Care to comment?

01:05:22.135 --> 01:05:26.135
- You're pressing your luck, Boyle.
- Nice going, Boyle.

01:05:26.135 --> 01:05:29.135
I really resent that question.

01:05:29.135 --> 01:05:30.135
Get the fuck off.

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:33.135
Why do you never ask
the Communist leaders?

01:05:33.135 --> 01:05:37.094
They are not the only victims.
We have victims too.

01:05:41.135 --> 01:05:45.135
They know there are no death squads
in El Salvador.

01:05:45.135 --> 01:05:48.135
The outrage of the people against
the Communist threat...

01:05:48.135 --> 01:05:52.094
...cannot be stopped
or organized by anyone.

01:05:55.135 --> 01:05:59.135
Sir, the polls show you trailing
the Christian Democrats.

01:05:59.135 --> 01:06:03.135
Are you sure you can capture both
the Catholic and the woman's vote?

01:06:03.135 --> 01:06:07.094
Bullshit question. Saves a tape.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:15.135
Do you mind? I'm gonna buy it
for my sister. Looks nice.

01:06:15.135 --> 01:06:18.135
Oh, here he comes. Mr. Gomez?

01:06:18.135 --> 01:06:20.135
Mr. Gomez, question, please.

01:06:20.135 --> 01:06:21.135
Get him, get him.

01:06:21.135 --> 01:06:25.094
No interviews with this piece of shit.

01:06:32.135 --> 01:06:35.135
What are you gonna do about it, fatso?

01:06:35.135 --> 01:06:37.135
This is not going to fly.

01:06:37.135 --> 01:06:39.135
Think about your image.

01:06:39.135 --> 01:06:43.135
Shit about your image.
I'll cut your balls off, Boyle!

01:06:43.135 --> 01:06:47.135
Do it yourself, huh?

01:06:47.135 --> 01:06:50.135
Huh, you chicken shit?

01:06:50.135 --> 01:06:54.094
Hi, you guys from Washington? Huh?

01:07:02.135 --> 01:07:06.094
You're a real pro, Boyle.

01:07:12.135 --> 01:07:14.135
Doc! Doc, where's Maria?

01:07:14.135 --> 01:07:18.135
Boyle! They found Carlos, man.

01:07:18.135 --> 01:07:20.135
- Where?
- He's fucked up.

01:07:20.135 --> 01:07:24.094
Over there, man, he's really
fucked up bad.

01:08:42.135 --> 01:08:44.135
- Maria, please.
- Don't touch me!

01:08:44.135 --> 01:08:46.135
He was acting stupid! Why blame me?

01:08:46.135 --> 01:08:50.093
Ever since you've gotten here
there's been nothing but problems.

01:08:51.135 --> 01:08:54.135
It wasn't my fault!

01:08:54.135 --> 01:08:58.093
Great going, Boyle. Have a drink.

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:04.093
Damn it.

01:09:06.135 --> 01:09:08.135
I really love her, man. I mean...

01:09:08.135 --> 01:09:12.093
...she and the kids were the only
decent thing I ever had in my life.

01:09:15.135 --> 01:09:19.093
I don't know why I'm living anymore.

01:09:51.135 --> 01:09:52.135
That's all I got is 10.

01:09:52.135 --> 01:09:56.135
- Fifteen.
- I was only in there for five minutes.

01:09:56.135 --> 01:09:57.135
That guy kept interrupting me.

01:09:57.135 --> 01:10:01.093
I would have been out of there faster.
All I got is 10.

01:10:02.135 --> 01:10:06.093
Okay, 10.

01:10:30.135 --> 01:10:32.135
You asshole.

01:10:32.135 --> 01:10:35.135
I'll give you 50 percent interest.

01:10:35.135 --> 01:10:37.135
- Know what you said?
- Huh?

01:10:37.135 --> 01:10:41.093
That you'd pay her
in two menstrual cycles, you moron.

01:11:07.135 --> 01:11:11.093
I'm sure you don't need it,
and I can't say I approve, but...

01:11:12.135 --> 01:11:16.093
...merry Christmas, Richard.

01:11:22.135 --> 01:11:26.135
Get over here. Get over here.

01:11:26.135 --> 01:11:29.135
Get over here.

01:11:29.135 --> 01:11:31.135
Oh, Richard.

01:11:31.135 --> 01:11:35.135
Cathy, talk to Maria.

01:11:35.135 --> 01:11:39.135
I need Maria. Talk to Father Paul.
She listens to him.

01:11:39.135 --> 01:11:43.135
You're old enough to be her father.
Forget her.

01:11:43.135 --> 01:11:44.135
I'm in love with her.

01:11:44.135 --> 01:11:48.135
I love you, Richie.

01:11:48.135 --> 01:11:52.093
Father Paul has to follow
the papal orders, there's nothing...

01:11:53.135 --> 01:11:57.093
I hate that.
I hate when you do that so much.

01:11:58.135 --> 01:12:02.135
- What about your other wife and kid?
- She left me. She took my kid.

01:12:02.135 --> 01:12:05.135
So you're going to bring Maria
back with you?

01:12:05.135 --> 01:12:09.093
What's she gonna do, Richard?
Sell snow cones on Fisherman's Wharf?

01:12:10.135 --> 01:12:14.093
Down here she has a purpose.
Up there she's a fish out of water.

01:12:15.135 --> 01:12:16.135
Yeah, I know.

01:12:16.135 --> 01:12:20.135
You don't have enough money
to support the kid you've already got.

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:24.135
I need to talk to you about
my whole life, it's such a mess.

01:12:24.135 --> 01:12:26.135
- It's disgusting.
- You're disgusting.

01:12:26.135 --> 01:12:29.135
What are you doing here?

01:12:29.135 --> 01:12:33.135
- You're not making it as a journalist.
- I'll make it again.

01:12:33.135 --> 01:12:37.093
I will make it again.

01:12:43.135 --> 01:12:47.093
The white hand's been painted
on the parish house wall.

01:12:48.135 --> 01:12:51.135
Your altar boy is dead.

01:12:51.135 --> 01:12:55.093
Even the Peace Corps has moved out.

01:12:57.135 --> 01:13:00.135
I love it here.

01:13:00.135 --> 01:13:03.135
I just can't go back.

01:13:03.135 --> 01:13:07.093
I know. I love it here too.

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:13.135
- Can you have dinner with me?
- No.

01:13:13.135 --> 01:13:17.135
- Tomorrow night?
- No, I can't. Besides, you smell.

01:13:17.135 --> 01:13:21.135
I'm going to the airport tomorrow.
Two nuns are coming in.

01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:23.135
Sometime?

01:13:23.135 --> 01:13:26.135
Maybe.

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:30.093
- Be careful on the way to the airport.
- Yeah.

01:13:43.135 --> 01:13:47.093
Wait a minute,
I'll walk you to your car.

01:13:58.135 --> 01:14:01.135
- Merry Christmas, Richard.
- Bye.

01:14:01.135 --> 01:14:02.135
- You be good.
- I will.

01:14:02.135 --> 01:14:06.093
- I don't trust you.
- I will be.

01:14:07.135 --> 01:14:11.093
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.

01:14:26.135 --> 01:14:29.135
Gringo.

01:14:29.135 --> 01:14:33.093
Let's take a walk
down by the beach, gringo.

01:14:34.135 --> 01:14:36.135
I'm not going to the beach with you.

01:14:36.135 --> 01:14:40.093
I'll tell you something else, I'm not
only a fucking lrishman, I'm...

01:14:44.135 --> 01:14:47.135
...I'm a fucking Viking.

01:14:47.135 --> 01:14:51.093
I'll take as many of these creeps
to fucking Valhalla as I can!

01:14:52.135 --> 01:14:56.135
You got a big mouth.
Major Max has got a present for you.

01:14:56.135 --> 01:14:57.135
Come to the beach.

01:14:57.135 --> 01:15:01.135
Come on, cocksucker,
you'll have to fucking kill me!

01:15:01.135 --> 01:15:05.093
You ain't fucking taking me alive!
Come on!

01:15:22.134 --> 01:15:26.093
You want to play
a fucking game, Boyle?

01:15:27.134 --> 01:15:30.134
Okay, first I'll take your arms...

01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:32.134
...then I'll take your legs...

01:15:32.134 --> 01:15:36.093
...then your balls.
Sound like a fun game?

01:15:40.134 --> 01:15:44.093
Okay, cocksuckers,
how do you like these odds, huh?

01:15:48.134 --> 01:15:52.093
He's worthless.

01:15:53.134 --> 01:15:57.093
You are an important man, Jefe.

01:15:58.134 --> 01:16:02.093
A photograph for me?

01:16:22.134 --> 01:16:26.093
Enough!

01:16:29.134 --> 01:16:33.134
Boyle, I'll be back for you.

01:16:33.134 --> 01:16:37.093
Fuck you!

01:16:43.134 --> 01:16:47.093
Yeah, up yours too, Jack.

01:17:09.134 --> 01:17:12.134
- How was Nicaragua?
- Oh, bad.

01:17:12.134 --> 01:17:16.134
There's no gasoline.
People line up for hours to get food.

01:17:16.134 --> 01:17:18.134
Worse than...
Very, very destructive.

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:22.093
On the other hand, there's been
no political execution of Somazastias.

01:17:23.134 --> 01:17:26.134
I can't believe this.
Get your passports ready.

01:17:26.134 --> 01:17:30.093
What's the matter?

01:17:39.134 --> 01:17:43.093
We have done nothing!

01:17:46.134 --> 01:17:50.093
I'm a good friend of Ambassador Kelly.
You'll be in a lot of trouble.

01:19:16.134 --> 01:19:20.134
The bodies of four American women
missing since Tuesday were found...

01:19:20.134 --> 01:19:22.134
...here today, at a roadside grave...

01:19:22.134 --> 01:19:25.134
...25 miles east of San Salvador.

01:19:25.134 --> 01:19:29.092
The victims were identified as...

01:19:41.134 --> 01:19:45.134
I just heard five guards did it for
15 colones and a bottle of Tic Tack.

01:19:45.134 --> 01:19:49.092
And they got this clown mayor
to sign the death certificates.

01:19:50.134 --> 01:19:53.134
- Will he talk?
- If we can keep him alive.

01:19:53.134 --> 01:19:57.092
- What are the chances of that?
- Slim to none, and he knows it.

01:19:58.134 --> 01:20:01.134
He had no business signing
without an autopsy.

01:20:01.134 --> 01:20:05.134
I want to know if those bullets
are rebel or government!

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:09.134
You knew Cathy well, didn't you?

01:20:09.134 --> 01:20:10.134
What do you think?

01:20:10.134 --> 01:20:14.092
Rumor has it they ran a roadblock
and there was an exchange of gunfire.

01:20:21.134 --> 01:20:25.134
He says the doctors won't do it
because they don't...

01:20:25.134 --> 01:20:28.134
- They don't have their masks.
- Masks, huh?

01:20:28.134 --> 01:20:32.092
Okay, pal. All right.

01:20:35.134 --> 01:20:37.134
We're cutting off all aid as of today.

01:20:37.134 --> 01:20:41.092
Sir, they were coming from Managua,
and they were Communist-oriented.

01:20:42.134 --> 01:20:46.134
Maybe they got spooked at the
roadblock, maybe they were packing.

01:20:46.134 --> 01:20:49.134
Pistol-packing nuns, my ass.

01:20:49.134 --> 01:20:52.134
I knew Cathy.
You can't sell me that shit.

01:20:52.134 --> 01:20:56.134
General Garcia has assured me
of a complete investigation.

01:20:56.134 --> 01:20:59.134
Have the fox investigate
the chicken coop, huh?

01:20:59.134 --> 01:21:02.134
You must think I'm stupid, colonel.

01:21:02.134 --> 01:21:03.134
I know all about you.

01:21:03.134 --> 01:21:07.092
Reagan's team coming down here to talk
to Max without checking with me.

01:21:09.134 --> 01:21:11.134
It's all going in my report.

01:21:11.134 --> 01:21:15.092
You gave a clear signal to the
Arana people that resulted in this.

01:23:12.134 --> 01:23:16.092
We want to do a real in-depth
and sympathetic portrait.

01:23:19.134 --> 01:23:21.134
For the first time
our armies are united.

01:23:21.134 --> 01:23:24.134
We now control a third
of Chatalengo in the west...

01:23:24.134 --> 01:23:27.134
COMANDANTE MARTI Nom de Guerre
Field Commander, Rebel Army

01:23:27.134 --> 01:23:29.134
...and Morazon Province in the east.

01:23:29.134 --> 01:23:33.092
We want the people and all government
troops to join our final offense.

01:23:35.134 --> 01:23:37.134
We'll take all major cities.

01:23:37.134 --> 01:23:40.134
Santa Ana, San Vicente, San Miguel.

01:23:40.134 --> 01:23:42.134
Then San Salvador will fall.

01:23:42.134 --> 01:23:45.134
When, captain?

01:23:45.134 --> 01:23:46.134
Before Reagan.

01:23:46.134 --> 01:23:48.134
And you think you're ready?

01:23:48.134 --> 01:23:51.134
With 4000 troops,
take all of El Salvador?

01:23:51.134 --> 01:23:54.134
The Pentagon won't let it happen.

01:23:54.134 --> 01:23:58.134
The will of the people and the march
of history cannot be changed.

01:23:58.134 --> 01:24:02.092
Not even by the Norteamericanos.

01:24:03.134 --> 01:24:05.134
What does it say?

01:24:05.134 --> 01:24:09.092
"Leticia cleans her gun."

01:24:40.134 --> 01:24:44.134
- Careful on the way out.
- Don't worry, I have experience.

01:24:44.134 --> 01:24:46.134
- I'm serious.
- Thanks.

01:24:46.134 --> 01:24:50.092
- Good luck.
- Okay, bye. Thank you.

01:25:04.134 --> 01:25:06.134
This doesn't show much.

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:10.092
I stuck my neck out for you, Boyle.
You're not too popular around here.

01:25:11.134 --> 01:25:15.134
- Where were these taken?
- I can't tell you, but it's old stuff.

01:25:15.134 --> 01:25:18.134
Shotguns, bolt action rifles,
captured Belgian FLNs.

01:25:18.134 --> 01:25:22.134
Fifty cals, 120 mike-mikes
taken from government troops.

01:25:22.134 --> 01:25:26.092
- Any anti-aircraft stuff? Any SAMs?
- Nothing.

01:25:29.134 --> 01:25:33.092
How about it? How about a cédula
for my woman and her two kids?

01:25:34.134 --> 01:25:36.134
There's not much, or you're
not saying everything.

01:25:36.134 --> 01:25:38.134
Christ!

01:25:38.134 --> 01:25:40.133
What about recoilless rifles, RPGs?

01:25:40.133 --> 01:25:42.133
They're in shit shape,
getting nothing.

01:25:42.133 --> 01:25:45.133
When will you believe
what your eyes see...

01:25:45.133 --> 01:25:47.133
...and not what Intelligence
tells you to think?

01:25:47.133 --> 01:25:51.092
We got AWACs, infrareds, statements
from a defecting FRAN commandant...

01:25:52.133 --> 01:25:55.133
...and enough military intel to
prove 10,000 percent...

01:25:55.133 --> 01:25:59.133
...that this ain't no civil war,
but Commie aggression.

01:25:59.133 --> 01:26:01.133
You've been lying about
that from the beginning.

01:26:01.133 --> 01:26:05.133
You've not presented one shred of
proof to the American public...

01:26:05.133 --> 01:26:08.133
...that this is anything but
a legitimate peasant revolution.

01:26:08.133 --> 01:26:11.133
Don't tell me about the sanctity
of military intelligence.

01:26:11.133 --> 01:26:14.133
Not after Chile and Vietnam.
I was there, remember?

01:26:14.133 --> 01:26:16.133
I personally resent that kind of shit.

01:26:16.133 --> 01:26:18.133
Then resent it, okay?

01:26:18.133 --> 01:26:20.133
You've lied about the advisers here.

01:26:20.133 --> 01:26:23.133
- Lied about the trainers on TTY.
- Bullshit!

01:26:23.133 --> 01:26:26.133
You're lying about switching
humanitarian assistance money...

01:26:26.133 --> 01:26:28.133
...to Salvadoran military coffers.

01:26:28.133 --> 01:26:31.133
It's a lie that this war can be
won militarily, it can't.

01:26:31.133 --> 01:26:32.133
Of course it can.

01:26:32.133 --> 01:26:35.133
Calm down, Boyle.
I'm sorry about this.

01:26:35.133 --> 01:26:39.133
I'm not gonna listen to this wino
journalist's left-wing Commie crap.

01:26:39.133 --> 01:26:43.133
We know where this guy's sympathies
lie. Why are we talking to him?

01:26:43.133 --> 01:26:46.133
Look, Richard, you saw Martin.

01:26:46.133 --> 01:26:49.133
We know they're starting
some kind of an offensive.

01:26:49.133 --> 01:26:52.133
I'm not a fucking spy for you guys.

01:26:52.133 --> 01:26:54.133
Left-wing, colonel? Well, maybe.

01:26:54.133 --> 01:26:58.133
But I'm not a Communist, and you guys
are never able to tell the difference.

01:26:58.133 --> 01:26:59.133
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

01:26:59.133 --> 01:27:02.133
I love my country the same as you.
That may surprise you.

01:27:02.133 --> 01:27:06.133
You're the ones who trained Major Max
at the police academy.

01:27:06.133 --> 01:27:09.133
You trained Jose Medrano
and Rene Chacon.

01:27:09.133 --> 01:27:12.133
Trained them to torture and kill,
then sent them here.

01:27:12.133 --> 01:27:15.133
What did Chacon give us?
He gave us the Mano Blanco.

01:27:15.133 --> 01:27:19.133
What are the death squads,
but the brainchild of the CIA?

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:22.133
- You like that they're anti-Moscow.
- Bullshit!

01:27:22.133 --> 01:27:26.133
You let them close the universities,
wipe out the best minds.

01:27:26.133 --> 01:27:29.133
You let them wipe out
the Catholic Church.

01:27:29.133 --> 01:27:32.133
You let them do it all
because they aren't Commies.

01:27:32.133 --> 01:27:36.133
And that, colonel, is bullshit.

01:27:36.133 --> 01:27:39.133
You've created a major Frankenstein.

01:27:39.133 --> 01:27:41.133
We can control him.

01:27:41.133 --> 01:27:42.133
Like you control the Major Maxes...

01:27:42.133 --> 01:27:46.133
- Well, look who's here.
- Hi.

01:27:46.133 --> 01:27:49.133
What about Pol Pot and Castro?
Are they any better?

01:27:49.133 --> 01:27:53.133
Pol Pot and Castro?
I don't know if they're better.

01:27:53.133 --> 01:27:56.133
All I know is that some campecino
who can't read or write...

01:27:56.133 --> 01:28:00.133
...or feed his family, has to watch
his kid die of malnutrition.

01:28:00.133 --> 01:28:02.133
You think he gives a shit
about Marxism or capitalism?

01:28:02.133 --> 01:28:06.092
It was that kind of crap thinking that
lost us Vietnam, this guilt shit.

01:28:07.133 --> 01:28:11.133
You liberal assholes. What do you
think the KGB's doing, huh?

01:28:11.133 --> 01:28:12.133
Is that why you're here?

01:28:12.133 --> 01:28:16.133
Some kind of post-Vietnam experience,
like you need a rerun?

01:28:16.133 --> 01:28:20.133
You pour $120 million in here and
turn it into a military zone.

01:28:20.133 --> 01:28:23.133
- So you can have chopper parades?
- You're blowing it out your ass.

01:28:23.133 --> 01:28:25.133
You're only bringing misery
to these people.

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:27.133
I don't want to see another Vietnam.

01:28:27.133 --> 01:28:30.133
I don't want to see America
get another bad rap.

01:28:30.133 --> 01:28:34.133
I lost my hearing in this ear
over there, and for what?

01:28:34.133 --> 01:28:38.133
Fifteen dollars a photo
from Pacific News Service?

01:28:38.133 --> 01:28:42.133
I did it because
I believe in America.

01:28:42.133 --> 01:28:45.133
I believe that we stand
for something.

01:28:45.133 --> 01:28:47.133
For a constitution.

01:28:47.133 --> 01:28:50.133
For human rights, not just
for a few people...

01:28:50.133 --> 01:28:54.092
...but for everybody on this planet.

01:28:59.133 --> 01:29:01.133
You gotta think of the people first.

01:29:01.133 --> 01:29:05.092
In the name of human decency, something
Americans are supposed to believe in.

01:29:06.133 --> 01:29:10.133
You've got to try to make
something of a just society here.

01:29:10.133 --> 01:29:14.133
Look, Richard, it's all part of our
national plan.

01:29:14.133 --> 01:29:18.133
We do a lot of good down here.

01:29:18.133 --> 01:29:21.133
I'm often asked by people like
you to examine my conscience...

01:29:21.133 --> 01:29:25.091
...and I do examine it.
- And what do you find, Jack?

01:29:26.133 --> 01:29:29.133
That whatever mistakes we make
down here...

01:29:29.133 --> 01:29:33.091
...the alternative would be ten
times worse.

01:29:36.133 --> 01:29:40.091
Maybe I'll just, like, forge
a cédula for my girlfriend...

01:29:44.133 --> 01:29:48.133
They're on the house.

01:29:48.133 --> 01:29:51.133
Boyle.

01:29:51.133 --> 01:29:55.133
Boyle!

01:29:55.133 --> 01:29:58.133
There's something you should know.

01:29:58.133 --> 01:30:01.133
My Salvo counterparts are mighty
pissed about some periodistas...

01:30:01.133 --> 01:30:03.133
...going out with the terrorists.

01:30:03.133 --> 01:30:07.133
If they can catch one,
they'll make a lesson out of him.

01:30:07.133 --> 01:30:08.133
Look, I'll get out of your hair.

01:30:08.133 --> 01:30:12.133
Just get me a cédula for my girlfriend
and her two kids, I'm gone.

01:30:12.133 --> 01:30:16.133
Getting a cédula for your whore
is the least of your problems.

01:30:16.133 --> 01:30:19.133
Personally, I don't give a shit
if they kill you or not.

01:30:19.133 --> 01:30:22.133
I happen to hate the species
you belong to.

01:30:22.133 --> 01:30:26.133
But I'm telling you,
they're serious.

01:30:26.133 --> 01:30:30.091
If I were you, I'd get my rubber
shoes on and get to the airport.

01:30:31.133 --> 01:30:34.133
You'll fit in here really well,
you know that?

01:30:34.133 --> 01:30:37.133
You sound just like another gangster.

01:30:37.133 --> 01:30:39.133
Dumb fuck!

01:30:39.133 --> 01:30:43.133
...a panning shot for the beginning
of the interview, okay?

01:30:43.133 --> 01:30:45.133
Come over here.

01:30:45.133 --> 01:30:49.133
- Can you tell me your name?
- Sorry, we can't speak to the press.

01:30:49.133 --> 01:30:51.133
Thank you, private. I appreciate it.

01:30:51.133 --> 01:30:54.133
- Can you tell me your name?
- No, I'm sorry, I cannot.

01:30:54.133 --> 01:30:58.133
- How about where you're from?
- Okay. Long lsland, New York.

01:30:58.133 --> 01:31:01.133
Well, welcome to El Salvador,
what do you think?

01:31:01.133 --> 01:31:04.133
It's not bad, but I'm anxious
to watch the Giants' game.

01:31:04.133 --> 01:31:07.133
- Know where a TV is?
- I don't know.

01:31:07.133 --> 01:31:08.133
Thanks, soldier.

01:31:08.133 --> 01:31:11.133
Excuse me, colonel.
Pauline Axelrod, ANS News.

01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:15.091
Does this signal a buildup of
U.S. combat troops here in El Salvador?

01:31:16.133 --> 01:31:18.133
Ma'am, these are not combat troops.

01:31:18.133 --> 01:31:21.133
They're trainers,
officially authorized by Congress.

01:31:21.133 --> 01:31:24.133
- No further comment.
- Thank you, sir.

01:31:24.133 --> 01:31:27.133
This is Pauline Axelrod,
ANS News, San Salvador.

01:31:27.133 --> 01:31:30.133
Listen, you got one thing
going for you...

01:31:30.133 --> 01:31:32.133
...and that's
Maria still cares about you.

01:31:32.133 --> 01:31:34.133
She does.

01:31:34.133 --> 01:31:38.133
If I were you, I'd straighten out my
act and go back to her on my knees.

01:31:38.133 --> 01:31:41.133
Doc, please.

01:31:41.133 --> 01:31:44.133
All right, just trying to help you.

01:31:44.133 --> 01:31:46.133
Doc!

01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:49.133
- Wilma! Hi, how are you?
- Fine.

01:31:49.133 --> 01:31:52.133
Boyle, did you meet Wilma?

01:31:52.133 --> 01:31:56.133
- Is this Wilma from the Panama Club?
- Well, she straightened up her act.

01:31:56.133 --> 01:31:58.133
And look at this.

01:31:58.133 --> 01:32:00.133
Bagel II, huh?

01:32:00.133 --> 01:32:01.133
That's great, Doc.

01:32:01.133 --> 01:32:04.133
- Come on. Let's go.
- She wants to take me shopping.

01:32:04.133 --> 01:32:08.133
- Do something about these drinks?
- Let me... Just a couple bucks.

01:32:08.133 --> 01:32:12.091
- What's this?
- She had a long career.

01:32:15.133 --> 01:32:19.091
- Thanks.
- See you.

01:32:20.133 --> 01:32:24.133
- Rich, you still got your wheels?
- Yeah.

01:32:24.133 --> 01:32:27.133
The G's just hit Santa Ana.

01:32:27.133 --> 01:32:30.133
- Wait, I gotta stop in the Libertad.
- No.

01:32:30.133 --> 01:32:32.133
- I gotta see Maria.
- No.

01:32:32.133 --> 01:32:34.133
Then go without me.

01:32:34.133 --> 01:32:38.091
All right, come on.

01:34:20.133 --> 01:34:23.133
Shit!

01:34:23.133 --> 01:34:27.091
Oh, fuck.

01:34:50.133 --> 01:34:54.133
Sign!

01:34:54.133 --> 01:34:58.091
Oh, fuck me.

01:35:42.133 --> 01:35:46.133
John!

01:35:46.133 --> 01:35:50.091
Look!

01:35:59.133 --> 01:36:01.133
John, wait! Shit.

01:36:01.133 --> 01:36:03.133
Crazy...!
John!

01:36:03.133 --> 01:36:07.091
Fuck.

01:36:08.132 --> 01:36:11.132
You crazy fucking fool!
You're not that magic!

01:36:11.132 --> 01:36:15.091
Today I am, Boyle.

01:36:56.132 --> 01:37:00.132
The Sandanistas have entered the war.
Equipment's being unloaded at Fonteca.

01:37:00.132 --> 01:37:03.132
- Possibly troops too.
- Any backup?

01:37:03.132 --> 01:37:06.132
No time. Santa Ana's fallen.
The country's split.

01:37:06.132 --> 01:37:09.132
The First Army's wiped out.
It's deteriorating very fast.

01:37:09.132 --> 01:37:11.132
El Salvador will fall in 48 hours.

01:37:11.132 --> 01:37:14.132
In 24. Their air force
has no ammo, no gas.

01:37:14.132 --> 01:37:17.132
We restore military aid
or go to Phase Three.

01:37:17.132 --> 01:37:20.132
The 82nd Airborne's on alert
and Marines are in position.

01:37:20.132 --> 01:37:23.132
- God almighty.
- What do you want to do?

01:37:23.132 --> 01:37:27.091
I won't get steamrolled into this.
Get substantiation on Nicaragua.

01:37:28.132 --> 01:37:30.132
That would take days.

01:37:30.132 --> 01:37:33.132
If we don't give the order
to evacuate soon...

01:37:33.132 --> 01:37:35.132
...I can't be responsible
for the safety of the embassy...

01:37:35.132 --> 01:37:38.132
...or the American community here.

01:37:38.132 --> 01:37:39.132
Listen, Tom...

01:37:39.132 --> 01:37:43.132
...we know you're leaving
in a few days, that's not the issue.

01:37:43.132 --> 01:37:47.132
The issue is, do you want to go down
in the history books...

01:37:47.132 --> 01:37:50.132
...as the man who lost El Salvador?

01:37:50.132 --> 01:37:53.132
That's hardly the issue!

01:37:53.132 --> 01:37:55.132
We're talking about human lives!

01:37:55.132 --> 01:37:57.132
We're not playing some computer game!

01:37:57.132 --> 01:38:01.132
Jesus, history books!

01:38:01.132 --> 01:38:05.091
God!

01:38:35.132 --> 01:38:38.132
The line is dead, sir.

01:38:38.132 --> 01:38:42.091
Where the fuck are the Americans?

01:38:56.132 --> 01:38:59.132
Sir...

01:38:59.132 --> 01:39:03.091
...you have a decision to make.

01:39:04.132 --> 01:39:06.132
All right.

01:39:06.132 --> 01:39:08.132
Okay.

01:39:08.132 --> 01:39:12.132
I'll recommend that we restore
all military aid.

01:39:12.132 --> 01:39:16.091
Give the order to release
the fuel and arms runs to llopango.

01:39:18.132 --> 01:39:22.091
Yes, sir.

01:39:56.132 --> 01:39:59.132
Figueroa's broken through.

01:39:59.132 --> 01:40:03.090
They're coming! Tanks!

01:40:05.132 --> 01:40:09.132
Don't let Figueroa pass!
I'll hold the front.

01:40:09.132 --> 01:40:13.090
- What about the prisoners?
- I'll take care of them.

01:40:15.132 --> 01:40:19.132
My 120's fucked up.

01:40:19.132 --> 01:40:21.132
Tanks?

01:40:21.132 --> 01:40:22.132
Panhards.

01:40:22.132 --> 01:40:24.132
Shit!

01:40:24.132 --> 01:40:28.090
Can you lay two more rolls
of Tri-X on me?

01:40:41.132 --> 01:40:45.090
No pictures.

01:40:47.132 --> 01:40:49.132
Is this your justice?

01:40:49.132 --> 01:40:52.132
It's necessary.
Get them out of here.

01:40:52.132 --> 01:40:54.132
You've become just like them!

01:40:54.132 --> 01:40:57.132
This is war! You don't have
the stomach for it...

01:40:57.132 --> 01:41:01.090
...get out!

01:41:07.132 --> 01:41:11.090
You've become just like them.

01:43:24.132 --> 01:43:28.090
Oh, fucker! Fucker!

01:43:38.132 --> 01:43:42.090
You believe this?

01:43:51.132 --> 01:43:55.090
John, no!

01:43:56.132 --> 01:44:00.090
John!

01:44:16.132 --> 01:44:17.132
Oh, Jesus, God.

01:44:17.132 --> 01:44:19.132
Oh, God, John.

01:44:19.132 --> 01:44:23.090
Why'd you want to put your...

01:44:28.132 --> 01:44:29.132
Don't move.

01:44:29.132 --> 01:44:33.090
Don't move.

01:44:39.132 --> 01:44:41.132
Breathe out.

01:44:41.132 --> 01:44:43.132
Breathe out.

01:44:43.132 --> 01:44:44.132
Can you breathe?

01:44:44.132 --> 01:44:47.132
Can you breathe?

01:44:47.132 --> 01:44:51.090
Can you breathe?

01:44:56.132 --> 01:44:59.132
I got the shot, Boyle.

01:44:59.132 --> 01:45:02.132
You got the shot.

01:45:02.132 --> 01:45:06.090
- Take it to New York.
- I'll get it to New York.

01:45:19.132 --> 01:45:23.090
Got it.

01:45:24.132 --> 01:45:28.132
Oh, Jesus, God.

01:45:28.132 --> 01:45:31.132
You got the magic shot.

01:45:31.132 --> 01:45:35.090
You got it. You're the best.

01:45:41.132 --> 01:45:45.090
We fucked up, didn't we?

01:46:04.132 --> 01:46:08.132
Don't wipe it on your thing,
clean it!

01:46:08.132 --> 01:46:10.132
Rich, you okay?

01:46:10.132 --> 01:46:12.132
Doc, give me a Valium, anything.

01:46:12.132 --> 01:46:16.132
I got something for you.

01:46:16.132 --> 01:46:18.132
- Here's two.
- Thank you.

01:46:18.132 --> 01:46:21.132
Goddamn, that looks horrible.

01:46:21.132 --> 01:46:24.132
Hey, hey! Where you going?

01:46:24.132 --> 01:46:26.132
Where you going?

01:46:26.132 --> 01:46:30.132
- Is it okay?
- It's all right. It'll be all right.

01:46:30.132 --> 01:46:32.132
I got some good news for you.

01:46:32.132 --> 01:46:35.132
Look, the bruja gave me some
cédulas for Maria and the kids.

01:46:35.132 --> 01:46:37.131
She did a pretty good job.

01:46:37.131 --> 01:46:41.090
And look, I got your exit visa
forged too.

01:46:42.131 --> 01:46:46.131
She kind of fucked up on that,
but I think it's gonna be all right.

01:46:46.131 --> 01:46:48.131
- Thank you.
- It'll work.

01:46:48.131 --> 01:46:51.131
You gotta get out of here, man.

01:46:51.131 --> 01:46:54.131
The police were over at Roberto's
looking for you.

01:46:54.131 --> 01:46:56.131
They say you're
in the country illegally.

01:46:56.131 --> 01:46:59.131
Roberto said he thinks you're dead.

01:46:59.131 --> 01:47:03.090
You got to get out of here.

01:47:12.131 --> 01:47:15.131
When we get there, hang back.

01:47:15.131 --> 01:47:17.131
If there's any trouble, call Kelly.

01:47:17.131 --> 01:47:20.131
If Kelly's gone, Morgan will help.
Got it?

01:47:20.131 --> 01:47:23.131
I heard you the first time. I know.

01:47:23.131 --> 01:47:25.131
Take care, don't stay here too long.

01:47:25.131 --> 01:47:29.131
Don't become a Tic Tack monster.
They kill people here.

01:47:29.131 --> 01:47:33.131
You believe everything
you read in the papers?

01:47:33.131 --> 01:47:37.090
I'll miss you, Doc.

01:47:38.131 --> 01:47:42.090
I'll miss you too.

01:47:45.131 --> 01:47:46.131
Is that my watch?

01:47:46.131 --> 01:47:49.131
Give it to me for the border.

01:47:49.131 --> 01:47:52.131
Cheap son of a bitch.

01:47:52.131 --> 01:47:56.090
Say hi to gringo-land for me,
all right?

01:48:01.131 --> 01:48:05.090
You guys be careful.

01:48:59.131 --> 01:49:03.131
It's fake.

01:49:03.131 --> 01:49:07.131
Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you,
all right? It was a rush job.

01:49:07.131 --> 01:49:11.131
I have to get to America.
I'm an important journalist.

01:49:11.131 --> 01:49:13.131
Newsweek. Understand?

01:49:13.131 --> 01:49:15.131
Newsweek. Time.

01:49:15.131 --> 01:49:19.090
CBS. Big shot.

01:49:26.131 --> 01:49:30.090
It's very important.

01:49:33.131 --> 01:49:37.090
Where's he going?

01:49:38.131 --> 01:49:40.131
Capital. You know... Oh, God.

01:49:40.131 --> 01:49:43.131
I have a very important appointment
in the capital...

01:49:43.131 --> 01:49:47.131
...with Ambassador Kelly
and Mr. Jose Duarte.

01:49:47.131 --> 01:49:51.090
Why don't you hold that...

01:50:17.131 --> 01:50:21.089
I'm a big fan
of the Raiders, actually.

01:50:25.131 --> 01:50:29.089
The ambassador, you know?
United States Embassy.

01:50:35.131 --> 01:50:38.131
I like the White Hand a lot.

01:50:38.131 --> 01:50:42.089
Tremble, tremble, Communists,
with the instincts of animals...

01:50:48.131 --> 01:50:52.131
The Mano Blanco doesn't hate you,
but you make trouble for Mr. Gomez.

01:50:52.131 --> 01:50:55.131
Willie Gomez is a friend of mine.

01:50:55.131 --> 01:50:59.089
That's why he wants you dead?

01:51:11.131 --> 01:51:13.131
Oh, God, not that film!

01:51:13.131 --> 01:51:17.089
That's the best war film of the year!

01:51:19.131 --> 01:51:23.089
Cassady died getting it,
you motherfucker!

01:51:24.131 --> 01:51:27.131
He died getting that film!

01:51:27.131 --> 01:51:28.131
He died getting that film!

01:51:28.131 --> 01:51:30.131
Fuck you! Fuck you, cocksuckers!

01:51:30.131 --> 01:51:33.131
Boyle is about to fucking die.

01:51:33.131 --> 01:51:34.131
And if he does, if he does...

01:51:34.131 --> 01:51:38.089
...your next job will be in Rwanda
counting fucking spears, understand?!

01:51:39.131 --> 01:51:43.089
Get the ambassador on the phone!

01:52:24.131 --> 01:52:27.131
Okay, I'm not kidding.

01:52:27.131 --> 01:52:31.131
I got $50,000 in traveler's checks.

01:52:31.131 --> 01:52:35.131
They're hidden, like,
two kilometers from here.

01:52:35.131 --> 01:52:38.131
You lie, you stupid gringo.

01:52:38.131 --> 01:52:42.089
Don't castrate him in here.
You'll make a mess. Shoot him.

01:52:53.131 --> 01:52:55.131
You tell General Martinez...

01:52:55.131 --> 01:52:58.131
...that I am still the ambassador
to this country for another day.

01:52:58.131 --> 01:53:01.131
I want those people out of there now...

01:53:01.131 --> 01:53:05.089
...or I'll make it the worst day
of his fucking life. You got that?

01:53:06.131 --> 01:53:10.131
Okay, fuck it.

01:53:10.131 --> 01:53:14.089
Let's get it over with.

01:53:22.131 --> 01:53:26.089
Are you kidding?

01:54:01.131 --> 01:54:05.089
A little American trick here.

01:54:09.131 --> 01:54:13.089
You know what that means?
You're all stupid cocksuckers.

01:54:18.131 --> 01:54:22.131
I hope you get anal herpes.

01:54:22.131 --> 01:54:24.131
Next?

01:54:24.131 --> 01:54:25.131
Where've you been?

01:54:25.131 --> 01:54:29.131
We just went to Nogales
for the afternoon with the family.

01:54:29.131 --> 01:54:33.089
- Did you take the roast out?
- Yes, I took care of it.

01:54:34.131 --> 01:54:37.131
When are we going to Disneyland?

01:54:37.131 --> 01:54:41.131
I don't know, next month.
He's getting spoiled, I'm telling you.

01:54:41.131 --> 01:54:45.089
- Okay. Next?
- Great. Thanks.

01:54:47.131 --> 01:54:51.089
Come on.

01:54:56.131 --> 01:54:59.131
I always dreamed
to come to California.

01:54:59.131 --> 01:55:01.131
It's a wacko joint.

01:55:01.131 --> 01:55:03.131
Not like El Salvador.

01:55:03.131 --> 01:55:06.131
You can be what you want,
do what you want...

01:55:06.131 --> 01:55:10.131
...as long as you got the money.

01:55:10.131 --> 01:55:13.131
Maybe I'll get some of my
Salvador stories published.

01:55:13.131 --> 01:55:16.131
I could write a story on John.

01:55:16.131 --> 01:55:19.131
I think we're gonna be okay.

01:55:19.131 --> 01:55:23.089
I think we're gonna be okay.

01:55:25.131 --> 01:55:29.089
Why are we stopping here?

01:55:37.131 --> 01:55:41.089
Please don't be alarmed,
just a routine lmmigration check.

01:55:45.131 --> 01:55:46.131
May I see your I.D., sir?

01:55:46.131 --> 01:55:49.131
Yeah, sure.
Will a driver's license do?

01:55:49.131 --> 01:55:53.131
We just went to Nogales for the day.

01:55:53.131 --> 01:55:55.131
Is that right? Are you his wife?

01:55:55.131 --> 01:55:58.131
- What is he saying?
- Yes, she is. Is there a problem?

01:55:58.131 --> 01:56:02.089
- May I see some identification?
- What is he saying?

01:56:08.131 --> 01:56:12.089
What is the problem here?
Look, she's with me.

01:56:13.131 --> 01:56:15.131
She's been through hell.

01:56:15.131 --> 01:56:19.089
I'm a journalist, she's my researcher.
I don't understand the problem.

01:56:20.131 --> 01:56:24.089
Come with me. Bring your children.

01:56:30.131 --> 01:56:33.131
Wait a minute. What are you doing?

01:56:33.131 --> 01:56:35.131
Sit down, sir, please.

01:56:35.131 --> 01:56:37.131
- Wait a minute.
- Hey, sit down.

01:56:37.131 --> 01:56:39.131
I'll sit down, but she's...

01:56:39.131 --> 01:56:43.089
Richard, stop it. I go.

01:56:44.131 --> 01:56:46.131
- But Maria, wait.
- I go. I be all right.

01:56:46.131 --> 01:56:50.089
Just take care of yourself.

01:56:54.131 --> 01:56:58.131
If you send her back, they will
kill her, rape her and mutilate her.

01:56:58.131 --> 01:57:00.131
If you send her back there...

01:57:00.131 --> 01:57:03.131
If you send the kids,
they'll kill them.

01:57:03.131 --> 01:57:05.131
You don't know what it's like!

01:57:05.131 --> 01:57:09.130
- You're under arrest.
- You have no idea what it's like!

01:57:09.130 --> 01:57:13.089
- Move it!
- You have no idea!

01:57:21.130 --> 01:57:23.130
Check point.

01:57:23.130 --> 01:57:26.130
Three illegals. One female Latino...

01:57:26.130 --> 01:57:27.130
...and two children.

01:57:27.130 --> 01:57:31.089
Bringing them in.

01:57:33.130 --> 01:57:36.130
One WMA. One Boyle, Richard...

01:57:36.130 --> 01:57:40.130
...birthdate 2-26-43.

01:57:40.130 --> 01:57:44.089
Check. Ten-four.

01:57:48.130 --> 01:57:52.089
Get him in.
