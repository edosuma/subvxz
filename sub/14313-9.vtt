17:42.461 --> 17:45.328
Get Cerebro.
It's all that matters.

Yes, Berzerker,
it's definitely on.

21:21.512 --> 21:22.829
Thank you, Sarah.

21:22.831 --> 21:24.664
Sure thing, professor.

21:24.666 --> 21:26.600
I'm glad you got
your machine back.

21:26.602 --> 21:28.752
But with Master Mold
still out there hunting us,

21:28.754 --> 21:31.255
things are sure to get
a whole lot worse.

21:31.257 --> 21:32.489
And that, Bishop,

21:32.491 --> 21:34.241
is what the X-Men are for,

21:34.243 --> 21:36.710
