01:42.680 --> 01:44.056
You still drinking coffee?

01:45.270 --> 01:46.806
You're still drinking coffee.

01:47.560 --> 01:50.609
Yes. I guess we just hope
for more for our children.

01:51.270 --> 01:53.852
We'll probably live longer, if that helps.

01:54.110 --> 01:56.180
If your generation
doesn't destroy the planet first.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.349
It's too late, I'm afraid.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.809
Clay, about the Baker trial--

02:00.910 --> 02:03.367
Can we just have one morning
without discussing that?

02:03.450 --> 02:05.327
The subpoenas go out today.

02:05.410 --> 02:06.820
Who's getting one besides me?

02:07.460 --> 02:09.746
Sorry, Clay,
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.838
The other day, you asked me
if a person could be prosecuted

02:13.920 --> 02:17.048
if they hurt someone,
but the victim couldn't come forward.

02:17.510 --> 02:19.751
You said it was hypothetical, but...

02:20.050 --> 02:21.711
you were talking about Hannah,
weren't you?

02:23.010 --> 02:24.557
I wasn't, actually.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.887
Because if something happened to her

02:28.980 --> 02:31.551
and you were involved in any way...

02:33.610 --> 02:34.929
You think I hurt her?

02:35.030 --> 02:36.270
-Lainie.
-I don't.

02:40.450 --> 02:44.693
IfI did hurt her, and I admitted it,
I could go to jail.

02:46.240 --> 02:50.700
W-Well, this is a civil proceeding,
not criminal.

02:50.790 --> 02:52.326
But it is sworn testimony.

02:52.420 --> 02:54.832
So if I lied, it's perjury.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.296
[doorbell rings]

02:57.380 --> 03:00.008
Why would you need to lie?

03:02.220 --> 03:04.347
IfI knocked down a stop sign
and a kid got killed,

03:04.430 --> 03:05.840
is that manslaughter?

03:05.930 --> 03:07.807
Clay, what the hell
are we talking about?

03:08.850 --> 03:09.839
I'm sorry, Mom.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.147
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

03:14.150 --> 03:15.560
[knock on door]

03:16.940 --> 03:19.397
It's... probably for me,
don't you think?

03:22.660 --> 03:25.868
Morning. Are you the parent
or guardian of Clay Jensen?

03:26.910 --> 03:29.617
I just don't get
why they're calling you to testify.

03:29.700 --> 03:33.704
Did Hannah ever say anything to you
about bullying or anything?

03:33.790 --> 03:34.836
What?

03:34.920 --> 03:38.833
No. We were friendly,
but we were never really that close.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.711
They're probably just fishing.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.384
Talking to every student who knew her.
It's probably nothing to worry about.

03:46.470 --> 03:50.099
Just... have to tell the truth,
okay, and you'll be fine.

03:51.850 --> 03:53.841
[M rs. Dempsey]
I’m surprised at Andy and Olivia.

03:55.190 --> 03:56.566
I'm sure they miss Anna.

03:56.650 --> 03:57.469
Hannah.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.390
Hannah, of course.

04:00.150 --> 04:01.731
But this is a witch hunt.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.230
I don't know.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.560
They're wasting their time.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.611
You didn't do anything.
You're not that kind of kid.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.073
I know how kind you are.
I see you take care of your sister.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.458
You're not going to jail, are you?

04:12.540 --> 04:14.076
He's not going to jail.

04:14.790 --> 04:16.781
How well did you even know this girl?

04:17.840 --> 04:19.205
I asked her out once.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.211
How many of these they got you
doing today?

04:24.300 --> 04:25.676
I got another couple.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.046
They got three of us out.

04:28.140 --> 04:30.882
Something like this
sure gets the community talking, huh?

04:30.970 --> 04:33.438
Sorry your kid's caught up in it.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.306
I know. Helluva thing.

04:36.730 --> 04:37.890
Helluva thing.

04:38.860 --> 04:41.488
Can you believe we moved here
for peace of mind?

04:43.360 --> 04:44.645
They're still talking.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.060
Jesus! Fucking Hannah!

04:48.990 --> 04:50.571
Yeah, fucking Hannah.

04:50.660 --> 04:52.366
Fuck her for killing herself.

04:52.450 --> 04:55.169

Aren't you freaked?

04:55.250 --> 04:57.286

what happened last night.

06:09.780 --> 06:12.157
I talked to Ryan and Zach.
Yes to both.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.652
It has to be Clay.
How else did they get our names?

06:14.740 --> 06:17.789
-He gave them the tapes.
-Could've been Hannah's phone, her texts.

06:17.870 --> 06:19.952
We need to make a plan.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.589
We need to stop texting. Seriously,
if they get our text records, we're done.

06:23.670 --> 06:26.082
Oh, my God,
I didn't even think about that.

06:26.170 --> 06:28.832
Spread the word,
we all need to meet in person.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.295
Did you guys get subpoenas too?

06:31.390 --> 06:33.506
Shut up! Jesus, Tyler!

06:33.600 --> 06:36.091
What? It's public record now.
Everyone knows.

06:36.180 --> 06:39.183
Nobody knows about anything.
You're gonna keep it that way.

06:39.270 --> 06:41.977
I want in, on whatever you're doing.

06:42.060 --> 06:43.891
I know more than anyone.

06:43.980 --> 06:47.279
I know a lot more than is
on those tapes, and I have proof.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.566
Proof of what?

06:48.650 --> 06:50.561
What do you think?

06:50.660 --> 06:53.402
What have you done around here
you don't want anyone to know?

06:53.490 --> 06:54.900
I take a lot of pictures.

06:54.990 --> 06:57.242
Listen, you creep,
you do not want to fuck with us!

06:57.330 --> 07:00.117
What we did to Clay was nothing.
Back off!

07:00.210 --> 07:01.199
And keep quiet.

I'm sorry. I needed to see you.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.241
I'm gonna scream.

07:39.330 --> 07:41.321
-I texted and I called.
-I'm gonna call the police.

07:41.410 --> 07:43.787

I was trying to protect you.

07:45.170 --> 07:46.706
Protect me?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.164
Seriously?

07:48.250 --> 07:51.083
I thought if you didn't know,
if no one found out--

07:51.170 --> 07:54.719
What? I'd be fine? I'd go about my life?

07:54.800 --> 07:57.428
You and I would get married
and live happily ever after?

07:57.510 --> 07:59.421
That's what I wanted, was for us to...

08:00.230 --> 08:01.049
to be together.

08:01.690 --> 08:02.509
Forever.

08:02.600 --> 08:03.931
You let him.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.476
-You let him.
-No, I was drunk.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.434
And I was scared.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.430
-So was I.
-Bryce was at the--

08:10.530 --> 08:13.408
-Don't say that name!
-I'm sorry, it's just that...

08:15.200 --> 08:18.658
Every time I was thrown out,
when my mom was fucked up,

08:18.740 --> 08:21.117
one of her boyfriends
was fucking with me...

08:22.250 --> 08:23.239
he was there for me.

08:23.580 --> 08:25.320
When I had no money,

08:25.420 --> 08:26.910
when I was starving,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.127
his folks bought my shit for school.

08:30.590 --> 08:33.627
Okay, when my mom
was busted for possession,

08:33.720 --> 08:35.335
he got his dad to bail her out.

08:35.430 --> 08:37.250
They do that shit so they can own you.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.169
No.

08:38.260 --> 08:42.344
Okay? Last year, I couldn't afford
new shoes for basketball.

08:42.430 --> 08:44.807
I went through four pairs that season.

08:44.890 --> 08:46.721
When we got to playoffs,

08:46.810 --> 08:48.937
they just had, like, holes.

08:49.860 --> 08:52.602
Bryce didn't offer to buy me new shoes.

08:52.690 --> 08:55.102
-He pretended he had an extra pair.
-Justin.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.778
Are you seriously trying to make
excuses for what you did?

09:03.870 --> 09:04.700
No.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.279
I just want you to understand--

09:07.380 --> 09:10.793
And I want you to understand
what it's like to be raped.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.257
But I truly hope you never will.

09:19.970 --> 09:21.096

-No.

09:26.190 --> 09:29.398
I'm gonna go get that, and you're
gonna go back out the window.

If you ’ve listened this far
and haven ’t heard your name,

10:16.030 --> 10:19.193
well, I bet you know exactly
what’s coming now.

0r ma ybe you don ’1' ha ye any idea.

10:22.740 --> 10:24.287
Could that be true?

10:24.370 --> 10:26.156
Could a person he that sick?

10:27.910 --> 10:29.116
Let’s find out.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.627
But first we ha ye to start
at the beg/nn/ng

10:32.710 --> 10:34.587
of the worst day of my life.

10:35.960 --> 10:39.623
I guess I just thought that
Mr. Geris would be more understanding.

10:39.720 --> 10:43.383
Apparently he's not.
This is a letter of intent to evict.

10:43.470 --> 10:45.518
[Mrs. Baker] Yes, I know. I mean...

10:46.810 --> 10:49.768
I don't know, maybe I can get
on the phone and explain to him.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.353
[Mr. Baker] What's to explain?
He wants money, we don't have it.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.146
You can use my college savings.

10:54.230 --> 10:56.278
-[sighs] Hannah.
-What?

10:56.360 --> 10:58.066
If we have money problems,
I want to help.

10:58.150 --> 11:00.778
These aren't your money problems,
they're ours.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.691
Use it now. I can take out a loan.

11:02.780 --> 11:05.408
And I can take a gap year.
I'd be fine with that.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.570
Plenty of kids do it.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.820
It's not the worst idea.

11:09.620 --> 11:12.953
My brother took a year off.
He's a dentist. Didn't hurt him.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.043
Okay, I cannot even believe
you're considering

11:16.130 --> 11:17.950
jeopardizing our daughter's future. No!

11:18.050 --> 11:20.257
If it's my future,
don't I get a say in it?

11:20.340 --> 11:23.252
No! That money stays in the bank.

11:23.340 --> 11:28.209
I'm going to go over and talk
to Mr. Geris and convince him...

11:29.100 --> 11:31.056
[sighs] ...to put us on a payment plan.

11:31.140 --> 11:32.721
We have no leverage.

11:32.810 --> 11:34.437
We have my fucking charm!

11:37.530 --> 11:38.679
Hard to resist.

11:38.780 --> 11:39.599
Yeah.

11:41.070 --> 11:44.062
-[laughter]
-You're right. It's worth a try.

11:44.160 --> 11:47.869
Oh, shit, I was supposed to take
the bank deposit in today.

11:47.950 --> 11:49.326
It's due. It's due this afternoon.

11:49.410 --> 11:51.537
I can do it,
if you need it done today.

11:51.620 --> 11:54.748
That would be a big help. Are you okay
with Hannah making the deposit?

11:56.420 --> 11:58.490
I don't-- I don't see why not.

12:00.760 --> 12:01.966
Do I look okay?

12:02.470 --> 12:03.368
Yes.

12:03.470 --> 12:04.710
All right.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.961
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.675
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.186
-Go.
-I'm going.

12:17.610 --> 12:18.599
Love you!

12:42.260 --> 12:44.216
Um, hey, Helmet.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.671
Yeah, I know, I just got your text.

12:49.470 --> 12:52.974
Well, I... I don't know...
I just called.

12:53.770 --> 12:54.839
Oh, uh...

12:55.560 --> 12:58.188
Actually, I can just come by
and pick it up.

12:58.270 --> 13:00.147
I'm running errands today anyway.

13:00.230 --> 13:01.606
It's not a big deal.

13:03.650 --> 13:04.480
Okay.

13:20.670 --> 13:21.659
[engine starts]

13:53.790 --> 13:55.610
-Thanks.
-I could have mailed it.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.201
I was going to the bank anyway.

13:58.290 --> 13:59.780
And I wanted to come see you.

14:00.790 --> 14:01.745
Why?

14:03.090 --> 14:04.159
Just to say hey.

14:05.340 --> 14:06.159
Oh.

14:07.300 --> 14:10.542
I mean, uh,
haven't seen you in a while.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.750
You see me at school.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.551
Smells like someone _
burned the popcorn last night.

14:18.640 --> 14:22.599
Yeah, it must have been the new girl.

14:23.190 --> 14:26.318
Wow, that was quick.
They already found my replacement.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.607
Well, there's no replacement
for Hannah Baker.

14:34.370 --> 14:35.576
Clay, I'm...

14:37.330 --> 14:38.911
I'm really sorry about Jeff.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.128
I heard his funeral was beautiful.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.292
Sounds like the whole school
was there.

14:47.510 --> 14:49.125
Thought I might see you there.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.384
My parents needed me to work.

14:54.470 --> 14:56.461
[Hannah]
I wanted to tell Clay everything.

14:57.480 --> 15:01.439
How could I tell him anything anymore
after that night at the party?

15:01.520 --> 15:03.602
I should go. I got toilets to plunge.

15:03.690 --> 15:05.396
Get the new girl to do it.

15:05.940 --> 15:08.431
I lied. I am the new girl.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.277
Well, uh... see you.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.075
Yeah. See you.

15:21.580 --> 15:22.535
Oh, wait. Uh...

15:23.880 --> 15:26.201
I'm supposed to tell you
to turn in your uniform.

15:27.050 --> 15:28.790
Seriously, they really want that back?

15:29.420 --> 15:30.250
I know.

15:44.190 --> 15:45.009
Oh, shit.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.120
[breathing heavily]

16:24.400 --> 16:25.515
[engine starts]

16:27.650 --> 16:29.220
[tires screech]

16:40.950 --> 16:42.451
[bell dings]

17:10.230 --> 17:11.276
Morning.

17:11.360 --> 17:12.236
Good morning.

17:18.490 --> 17:20.617
-[sighs]
-[register keys beeping]

17:27.540 --> 17:28.746
$7.79.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.426
-[coin clatters]
-Whoops, sorry.

17:45.270 --> 17:46.259
Do I know you?

17:47.190 --> 17:48.259
Not really.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.599
[bell rings]

17:59.700 --> 18:03.613
I gotta tell you, the perfect disguise
for Clay Jensen is not a hoodie.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.149
Did you bring it?

18:16.380 --> 18:17.506
As requested.

18:19.340 --> 18:20.750
I knew you'd have one.

18:21.430 --> 18:23.136
Mind telling me why the switch?

18:24.060 --> 18:25.596
[sighs]

18:25.980 --> 18:26.969
I'm sorry.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.556
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.512
We had a deal that we would
do this together.

18:34.190 --> 18:36.818
You said when I got to the end,
we'll do what we have to do.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.106
Are you at the end?

18:38.700 --> 18:39.735
Almost.

18:41.740 --> 18:44.117
Are you going to pass them on?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.691
You and I both know Hannah
wanted them to get to number 13,

18:46.790 --> 18:49.452
but ifI give them to number 12,
that's the end of it.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.951
-Just give me a day. I have a plan.
-Clay.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.621
Do you trust me?

18:56.420 --> 18:57.330
Yeah.

19:10.270 --> 19:12.647
Hi, Mr. Porter, do you have a minute?

19:12.730 --> 19:14.015
Sure, sure, come in.

19:14.610 --> 19:15.599
Have a seat.

19:20.820 --> 19:22.276
What's going on, Sheri?

19:23.240 --> 19:24.730
I, um...

19:25.240 --> 19:29.404
I heard about people getting
these subpoenas today for court,

19:29.500 --> 19:32.958
and... I... [chuckles]

19:33.040 --> 19:36.168
Ijust... Iwanted
to talk to you about...

19:38.840 --> 19:39.659
Hannah Baker?

19:45.180 --> 19:47.557
Yeah. Well, I...

19:47.640 --> 19:50.848
Ijust... I guess... I don't really
know anything about that.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.473
I think the subpoenas today,
they have me a little worried, that's all.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.810
Hm. Okay, listen.

19:57.900 --> 20:01.859
If you get one, what matters most
is that you just tell the truth.

20:03.910 --> 20:06.026
Yeah. Yeah, right, right.

20:08.120 --> 20:08.939
Shen.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.242
And if you remember anything
or hear anything,

20:13.330 --> 20:15.070
you come tell us first, okay?

20:16.750 --> 20:17.990
I will.

20:18.090 --> 20:19.375
Thanks, Mr. Porter.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.057
-Shutterbug1337?
-Yeah.

20:32.140 --> 20:35.223
-You're late.
-Sorry, I had a thing.

20:35.310 --> 20:36.550
You ready to do this?

20:41.110 --> 20:42.691
-It's all there?
-Mm-hmm.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.155
Jesus, not here.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.377
-How do I know?
-Just hold it.

21:02.670 --> 21:04.422
That thing's got a kick.

21:04.510 --> 21:06.546
All right? You gotta use the right grip.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.460
Yeah, I'll Google that. Thanks.

21:14.350 --> 21:17.057
The first thing we need to do
is find out what they know.

21:17.150 --> 21:20.062
Or the first thing we need to do
is tell the truth.

21:20.150 --> 21:20.969
I'm with Alex.

21:21.070 --> 21:25.313
I don't think it's as easy as you think.
What exactly is the truth?

21:25.400 --> 21:27.652
Profound, Marcus, truly profound.

21:27.740 --> 21:28.616
And bullshit.

21:28.700 --> 21:31.191
Oh, my God, how did you find us?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.997
-I deserve to be here.
-No, you don't.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.457
Because you don't like me?
'Cause I embarrassed you?

21:36.540 --> 21:38.997
-I'm getting it worse than any of you.
-Let him stay.

21:39.080 --> 21:42.789
How did you get to run this meeting,
anyway? It's not the dance committee.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.582
-I sit, or I start taking pictures.
-Sit down.

21:47.720 --> 21:48.880
And calm down.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.216
[Ryan]
I think it's clear what they know.

21:52.310 --> 21:54.767
Look around.
What do we all have in common?

21:54.850 --> 21:57.091
We don't know who got the subpoenas.
Sheri didn't.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.589
Or she didn't get one yet.

21:58.690 --> 22:02.069
I told her to come aanay. Maybe she's
hoping she'll avoid the whole thing.

22:02.150 --> 22:05.187
Your dad must know something
from the other deputies.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.568
My dad's more of
a "sweep it under the rug" kind of guy.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.479
Works for me.

22:09.570 --> 22:11.151
I don't think he gives
a shit about you.

22:42.610 --> 22:45.022
[ringing]

22:45.110 --> 22:47.066
[woman]
9-1-1. How can I help you?

22:47.150 --> 22:49.903
Yes, hi. I would like to report a--

22:51.410 --> 22:54.732
Well, I would like to report
something I did

22:54.830 --> 22:56.445
a few weeks ago.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.741
[Cou rtney]
If we don ’1' get our stories straight

22:59.830 --> 23:02.378
before these depositions,
it's bad for all of us.

23:02.460 --> 23:04.951
[Alex] But what is the story exactly?

23:05.050 --> 23:06.836
[Courtney] Hannah was a liar.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.753
She was jealous and needy
and emotionally unstable.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.467
She thought everyone
was out to get her.

23:11.550 --> 23:12.881
[Tyler]
Aren't you describing yourself?

23:12.970 --> 23:15.552
[Courtney]
We tried to be her friends. We did.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.631
She blamed us when things went wrong.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.470
But
she
was the one with problems.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.686
[Zach] That's the story?

23:21.770 --> 23:23.476
-[Courtney] Yeah.
-What would you say it is?

23:23.560 --> 23:25.391
It doesn't matter what I say it is.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.277
'Cause there are three people
who aren't here

23:27.360 --> 23:29.316
who are likely to say
whatever they want.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.152
Where are Jessica and Justin?

23:31.240 --> 23:32.730
They weren't at school.

23:32.820 --> 23:33.809
Either of them.

23:38.950 --> 23:39.860
What?

23:47.050 --> 23:49.621
Justin went to Bryce's last night.

23:50.670 --> 23:52.831
He freaked because Jess
was flirting with Bryce.

23:52.930 --> 23:55.137
So he called Bryce a rapist,

23:55.220 --> 23:58.348
and told Jessica that everything
on the tapes was true.

24:00.930 --> 24:02.682
No fucking way.

24:02.770 --> 24:05.432
[Zach] Monty and Jamie
and a few other guys heard everything.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.226
[Courtney] Wait, wait, wait. They...

24:07.320 --> 24:09.561
They heard?
They know about the tapes?

24:09.650 --> 24:12.448
[Zach] Well, Justin didn't go into detail
about the tapes, no,

24:12.530 --> 24:14.521
but they heard him call Bryce a rapist

24:14.620 --> 24:16.656
and that Hannah was telling the truth.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.991
Good for Justin. And Bryce is a rapist.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.707
If you believe Hannah.

24:26.790 --> 24:31.625
Seriously? You are the only girl here
and that is the position you take?

24:31.720 --> 24:33.676
-Hannah lied. We know this.
-[Ryan scoffs]

24:33.760 --> 24:34.966
I don't know it.

24:35.050 --> 24:37.257
[Marcus] We can contain this.
We have to control the narrative.

24:37.350 --> 24:40.888
[Ryan] You're deluded. The narrative is,
Jess knows Bryce raped her.

24:40.970 --> 24:43.018
You guys would make
shitty chess players.

24:43.100 --> 24:44.931
We're two moves from being checkmated.

24:45.020 --> 24:46.510
[Marcus] Not necessarily.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.601
Not if we bring Bryce into it with us.

24:48.690 --> 24:50.396
Bryce. The rapist.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.232
-Alleged rapist.
-Fuck off, Courtney.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.189
Or we turn him in.

25:00.370 --> 25:04.033
Bryce is dangerous. I don't get
why we're still protecting him.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.075
-Thank you.
-[Marcus] We're not!

25:05.170 --> 25:06.626
We're protecting ourselves.

25:07.420 --> 25:10.912
I applied early admit to Columbia,
Zach's got scholarships.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.580
Ryan, I know you've got big plans.

25:12.670 --> 25:14.467
Courtney? Alex?

25:14.550 --> 25:17.587
I've got no plans.
I'm good to tell the truth.

25:17.680 --> 25:21.389
Just 'cause Hannah fucked up her life
doesn't mean she has to fuck up ours.

25:21.470 --> 25:22.676
[Tyler] Hear me out.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.596
If Clay gave the lavwers our names

25:25.690 --> 25:29.899
and Justin is running around saying
everything on the tapes is true,

25:29.980 --> 25:32.437
then it's only a matter of time
until we're all screwed.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.942
-But if we can get ahead of it--
-What do you mean?

25:35.780 --> 25:38.522
What if we confirm
Hannah's stories about Bryce?

25:39.530 --> 25:41.907
What if we give the school
their scapegoat?

25:42.200 --> 25:43.781
They have someone to blame.

25:43.870 --> 25:45.826
The Bakers have _
someone to charge With a crIme.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.286
Then whatever we did
doesn't matter as much.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.087
So you want to sacrifice Bryce
to save your own ass?

25:51.170 --> 25:53.582
Yeah. Of course.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.925
The Bakers are broke, right,

26:04.020 --> 26:06.511
and Bryce's family has the money
to make this all go away?

26:06.600 --> 26:08.682
Nothing we did compares to what he did.

26:08.810 --> 26:11.859
-You're fucking joking, right?
-Are you gonna defend Bryce?

26:11.940 --> 26:14.898
No, but aren't you?
You've been doing it for weeks now.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.527
Fuck you. No, I haven't.
I just didn't want this to blow up.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.157
Well, boom.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.403
Justin let Bryce do it, then lied.
Justin will go to jail too.

26:22.490 --> 26:25.448
Justin is my best friend. You think
he gives a shit about me right now?

26:25.540 --> 26:26.700
Don't you give a shit about him?

26:26.790 --> 26:29.076
What about Jessica? Doesn't she get a say?

26:29.170 --> 26:30.910
She should have answered when I called.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.457
My God, Courtney.
You should fucking listen to yourself.

26:33.590 --> 26:36.411
I can't imagine Jess
won't want Bryce in jail for life.

26:36.510 --> 26:39.582
Wanna know what's worse
than being a rapist? Hiding behind one.

26:41.010 --> 26:43.922
Fucking justifying a fucking rapist,
that's worse.

26:44.010 --> 26:46.763
You want to get the story straight?
We all know the story.

26:46.850 --> 26:48.977
Everything Hannah
said on the tapes is true.

26:49.060 --> 26:50.721
You're gay. So what?

26:50.810 --> 26:52.220
Tyler, you're a stalker.

26:52.900 --> 26:55.437
Ryan, you're an arrogant asshole.

26:55.530 --> 27:00.194
Zach, you're just an entitled idiot
who does cruel, stupid things

27:00.280 --> 27:02.771
even though you probably
have a decent heart.

27:02.870 --> 27:05.486
And Sheri's a fucking coward
who got a kid killed.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.992
-Alex, that's enough.
-No, Marcus.

27:08.080 --> 27:12.039
You'll do anything to keep up
your perfect reputation.

27:12.130 --> 27:16.999
And, yeah, I'm a fucking weak,
pathetic loser

27:17.090 --> 27:20.082
who ruined the one good thing
that I ever had

27:20.180 --> 27:23.252
because I wanted a rapist
to think I was just like him.

27:25.430 --> 27:26.886
Hannah was my friend.

27:31.100 --> 27:34.058
Because I know that if I had
still been friends with her...

27:35.770 --> 27:39.228
if any one of us had still been
friends with her, she'd be alive.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.779
So we tell the truth.

27:54.420 --> 27:56.297
Truth doesn't just land on Bryce.

27:56.670 --> 27:58.206
[Ryan] So let the truth land on us.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.872
I published a poem.
A fucking good and meaningful poem.

28:01.970 --> 28:03.790
I didn't mean tell the truth
about everything.

28:03.890 --> 28:04.845
[Zach] Why not, Tyler?

28:04.930 --> 28:06.841
You got more secrets
you're trying to hide?

28:06.930 --> 28:10.093
You can do whatever you want.
No one's going to believe you.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.512
People'll just laugh at you,
like they always do.

28:13.770 --> 28:14.805
They won't.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.567
Hannah's truth is not my truth.

28:19.650 --> 28:20.639
No way.

28:41.170 --> 28:42.159
[Mrs Baker]
I ’m so sorry.

28:42.340 --> 28:44.752
We should be getting more in stock soon.

28:44.840 --> 28:46.171
[woman] I'll check back.

28:47.180 --> 28:51.549
Tony, um... thanks so much for coming in.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.302
-Sorry I didn't come before school.
-It's okay.

28:54.390 --> 28:55.721
This is my friend Brad.

28:56.310 --> 28:57.356
Hi.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.180
Hi, how are you?

28:59.270 --> 29:01.682
-Great.
-Uh, is everything okay?

29:01.780 --> 29:06.615
Yeah, everything's fine, I just wanted
to talk to you about... something.

29:06.700 --> 29:09.908
Wanted to show you... something.

29:14.620 --> 29:15.826
Here, uh...

29:16.500 --> 29:17.410
I...

29:20.130 --> 29:23.509
I found something
in Hannah's closet, hidden away.

29:23.590 --> 29:25.467
-Okay.
-I thought maybe...

29:26.840 --> 29:30.503
you could help me understand
what it means.

29:32.430 --> 29:33.260
Wow.

29:34.060 --> 29:34.879
Um...

29:34.980 --> 29:36.936
Do you know or recognize
any of these names?

29:37.020 --> 29:39.602
I... I think they're kids at the school.

29:39.690 --> 29:43.148
Yeah, I mean "Clay"
I think is Clay Jensen.

29:43.240 --> 29:46.858
And some of these other names
I recognize from Hannah's phone

29:47.030 --> 29:48.611
and her Facebook page.

29:48.700 --> 29:51.737
They're actually going to be
subpoenaed for deposition.

29:51.830 --> 29:54.071
The lawyer said the papers
went out this morning.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.116
Yeah, I heard that at school.

29:56.210 --> 29:59.247
But why are they all connected,

29:59.330 --> 30:03.369
and why is "Bryce" circled so many times?

30:03.960 --> 30:07.339
And why... why are you on there?

30:09.260 --> 30:10.340
I don't know.

30:11.180 --> 30:12.249
Bullshit, Tony.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.558
Look, you've been very, very kind to us...

30:17.350 --> 30:20.433
but I don't think you're telling us
the whole truth, and you need to.

30:20.520 --> 30:21.396
Now.

30:24.860 --> 30:26.771
Hannah had secrets, Mrs. Baker.

30:26.860 --> 30:30.068
Hannah's secrets are what killed her,

30:30.160 --> 30:32.651
and they do not get to stay that way.

30:32.740 --> 30:34.150
Do you understand?

30:34.240 --> 30:37.323
I mean, clearly she was trying
to work something out here.

30:37.410 --> 30:41.449
There are names crossed out:
Kat, Mrs. Bradley, Mrs. Antilly.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.838
And you're on here. Why do you think?

30:45.710 --> 30:46.916
I don't know.

30:47.010 --> 30:49.831
Yours is the only name
with a question mark. Why?

30:54.180 --> 30:55.966
I don't know why my name
is on that sheet.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.379
[sighs]

31:00.020 --> 31:01.396
I think you do.

31:02.150 --> 31:03.185
Well...

31:04.270 --> 31:06.852
if you won't tell me,
maybe you'll tell the lawyers.

31:24.210 --> 31:26.451
You always introduce me as your friend.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.410
You are my friend.

31:28.510 --> 31:29.625
I'm your boyfriend.

31:30.340 --> 31:33.252
Yeah, well, boyfriend is so--

31:33.350 --> 31:34.169
Gay?

31:35.260 --> 31:36.966
That's not what I was going to say.

31:37.770 --> 31:38.759
It's just...

31:39.810 --> 31:43.644
Ryan always used to say,
"This is Tony, my boyfriend."

31:43.730 --> 31:45.186
Like I was some sort of possession.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.065
I get it.

31:49.150 --> 31:51.106
But I'm not Ryan.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.400
I know.

31:53.570 --> 31:57.233
I'm not gonna judge you, but you
have to tell me what's going on.

31:58.540 --> 32:01.532
Or I can't be your friend
or boyfriend or anything.

32:11.630 --> 32:12.756
I had a friend.

32:15.220 --> 32:16.551
Her name was Hannah.

32:20.180 --> 32:21.260
She killed herself.

32:23.850 --> 32:27.013
She left a job for me.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.106
Secrets to keep.

32:33.030 --> 32:34.941
I tried, I tried to honor her memory.

32:35.030 --> 32:39.615
I tried to keep those secrets,
but I don't think I did the right thing.

32:40.830 --> 32:43.287
Her parents are hurting.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.320
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.041
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I just...

32:51.590 --> 32:53.922
-I wanted to take care of Hannah.
-Come here.

33:02.890 --> 33:04.096
[Mrs. Baker] You lost it?

33:04.190 --> 33:06.181
[Mr. Baker]
Are you sure you didn't drop it?

33:06.270 --> 33:07.680
I looked everywhere.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.727
I retraced my steps.
Someone must have taken it.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.856
Generally that's what people do

33:12.940 --> 33:15.818
when they find a bag of cash
laying on the street.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.525
I'm so sorry, okay?

33:17.620 --> 33:19.076
[Mrs. Baker]
I just convinced the landlord

33:19.160 --> 33:20.730
to work with us to pay the back rent.

33:20.830 --> 33:22.786
I don't know what to say.

33:22.870 --> 33:25.282
I thought you were more
responsible than this.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.668
-We trusted you!
-It's a few hundred dollars.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.741
It's $743.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.252
You can have my last check
from the Crestmont.

33:32.340 --> 33:33.659
I have $200 in the bank.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.751
I can start babysitting on the weekend.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.889
Hannah... it's fine.

33:44.890 --> 33:48.018
[Hannah]
It seemed l/ke no matter
whatI did I kept letting people down.

33:48.730 --> 33:49.640
[sighs]

33:52.110 --> 33:55.489
I started th/nk/ng how eve/yones
lives would be better without me.

34:00.490 --> 34:02.071
And what does that feel l/ke?

34:03.700 --> 34:04.906
It feels l/ke nothing.

34:07.080 --> 34:11.369
L/ke a deep, endless,
always blank nothing.

34:17.260 --> 34:20.718
And for those of you who W/l/ now be
looking for signs everywhere...

34:21.260 --> 34:23.216
what does it really look //ke?
[Mrs. Baker] Mmm.

34:23.310 --> 34:25.301
Hey, Hannah, you still up?

34:25.600 --> 34:27.431
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.435
Oh, honey.

34:30.810 --> 34:32.812
[Hannah]
Here ’5 the scary thing.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.685
I'm gonna take a walk.

34:34.780 --> 34:37.066
[Mrs. Baker]
Okay. Don't be out too late.

34:37.150 --> 34:39.607
Take your jacket.
It's starting to get cold out.

34:40.570 --> 34:41.980
[Hannah]
It looks l/ke nothing.

34:52.290 --> 34:53.666
It wasn ’t a short walk.

34:56.510 --> 34:59.047
I walked forever that night.

34:59.130 --> 35:01.678
Through my old neighborhood
where the houses were nicer

35:01.760 --> 35:03.466
than the one we lived in now.

35:05.600 --> 35:08.387
All the way up to the MI
where the rich people live.

35:10.350 --> 35:11.556
Where you live.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.607
-,4nd from blocks away, I heard it.
-[music and chatter]

35:18.570 --> 35:19.639
The music.

35:20.990 --> 35:23.151
The murmur of voices.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.531
The siren call of a party.

35:40.380 --> 35:43.292
You U think I ’0' know better
than to follow that call

35:43.390 --> 35:44.880
alter Jessica ’5 party.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.215
But my feet followed it.

35:49.810 --> 35:53.439
My mind and heart were
st/l/ in the b/g, blank nothing.

36:12.620 --> 36:13.746
[doorbell rings]

36:16.540 --> 36:18.758
Jensen. The fuck do you want?

36:18.840 --> 36:20.967
Hey, Bryce, um...

36:22.220 --> 36:23.881
Listen, I was wondering...

36:24.720 --> 36:28.349
if... I mean, I was hoping
you wouldn't mind--

36:28.430 --> 36:31.809
Look, I know it's weird,
but I was hoping to buy some weed.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.721
It's kind of an emergency.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.521
You want to buy some weed.
From me.

36:41.820 --> 36:43.447
Yes, I do.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.730
If you wouldn't mind.

36:46.910 --> 36:48.275
Why would I mind?

36:49.240 --> 36:50.070
Come on in.

36:57.750 --> 36:59.456
So you need some weed, huh?

37:00.300 --> 37:02.040
Yeah, um, I do.

37:02.130 --> 37:04.428
'Cause you got yours confiscated
the other day.

37:05.930 --> 37:09.093
-You heard about that?
-[laughs] Yeah, everybody did.

37:09.180 --> 37:13.469
Any time one of the squealq clean kids
gets dirty, it's pretty big news.

37:14.390 --> 37:16.517
That's... interesting.

37:17.310 --> 37:20.063
I'm gonna hook you up this time
'cause you seem desperate,

37:20.150 --> 37:22.027
and I happen to have shit on hand.

37:22.110 --> 37:23.816
And, you know, 420 brotherhood.

37:24.650 --> 37:26.356
But I'm not a dealer, okay?

37:26.450 --> 37:29.362
If you need a regular thing,
I can hook you up with my guy.

37:31.410 --> 37:32.946
You keep it on the coffee table?

37:33.040 --> 37:35.827
My parents are in Ibiza.
They won't be back for a week.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.418
So, what do you want?
Like, an eighth?

37:42.300 --> 37:43.335
Yeah?

37:43.420 --> 37:44.751
Indica or sativa?

37:47.590 --> 37:48.887
Um, hybrid.

37:51.260 --> 37:52.511
Hybrid. I concur.

37:53.810 --> 37:56.381
Gotta say, man,
I did not take you for a stoner.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.220
Yeah, well...

37:58.940 --> 38:02.182
I guess you never know what's going on
in someone else's life, right?

38:09.370 --> 38:11.827
I bet you have some great parties
out here, huh?

38:12.660 --> 38:14.116
[Bryce] Fuckin' legendary.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.202
[pop music playing over speakers]

38:27.720 --> 38:29.585
-Hey, Hannah.
-Hey.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.671
[girls shrieking]

38:40.730 --> 38:44.188
[Jessica] I am starving!
Can you please grab me a slice of pizza?

38:45.030 --> 38:46.065
Hey, Hannah.

38:48.110 --> 38:50.317
Hannah! Hannah Baker!

38:51.120 --> 38:52.326
Hey, Jess.

38:52.410 --> 38:56.995
Can you do me a huge favor
and grab me a slice of pepperoni?

38:57.830 --> 38:58.660
Sure.

38:58.750 --> 39:00.320
[Zach] Hannah! Me too!

39:00.580 --> 39:02.161
Get me, like, two slices.

39:02.250 --> 39:04.957
[Hannah]
I was surprised to see Jessica
at another party.

39:05.050 --> 39:07.462
Hannah Baker's here to save the day!

39:07.760 --> 39:10.502
-Whoo!
-Hannah! Hannah!

39:10.590 --> 39:12.137
[Hannah]
Baker Pizza at your service.

39:12.220 --> 39:14.381
Oh, my God, you are amazing.

39:14.470 --> 39:18.054
[Hannah]
But then, I was surprised
to see myself at another party.

39:18.730 --> 39:20.846
Yes, thank you, Hannah!

39:21.560 --> 39:23.516
You're gonna get grease in the water.

39:23.610 --> 39:25.851
Think of it as a moisturizing
spa treatment.

39:25.940 --> 39:28.522
I read that pepperoni oil
reduces cellulite.

39:28.610 --> 39:31.522
I read that too, except it
only works mixed with cheese.

39:31.610 --> 39:32.770
And tomato sauce.

39:33.070 --> 39:34.731
[both laugh]

39:36.120 --> 39:37.860
Have you been here all night?

39:37.950 --> 39:39.656
No, I just got here.

39:39.750 --> 39:42.127
Oh, just when everyone's leaving.

39:42.210 --> 39:43.450
I'm not going anywhere.

39:43.540 --> 39:46.168
Yeah. This party is far from over.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.836
Hannah, don't just stand there, get in!

39:48.920 --> 39:50.831
I didn't bring a bathing suit.

39:50.930 --> 39:54.252
So? Wear your underwear.
Everybody else is.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.341
Just like a bikini.

39:57.850 --> 40:00.171
Oh, my God, don't be such a pussy.
Get in!

40:00.270 --> 40:02.727
Whoa. No, okay, okay. Stop.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.299
-Oka
y.
-Yes?

40:04.980 --> 40:05.810
[Zach] Whoo!

40:09.860 --> 40:11.691
[Hannah]
And I can ’t explain it. . .

40:13.200 --> 40:15.577
but sitting there under the stars. . .

40:16.700 --> 40:20.454
I felt at peace
for the first time in days.

40:22.330 --> 40:25.163
[girl] Oh, my God,
are they gonna do it right in here?

40:25.250 --> 40:27.992
[Zach] Nah, there's, like, eight rooms
in that house. [chuckles]

40:28.710 --> 40:30.120
Shit. Sorry!

40:30.210 --> 40:31.620
-[laughter]
-I'm so sorry, Hannah!

40:31.720 --> 40:32.618
[Hannah] No worries.

40:32.720 --> 40:33.835
Oh...

40:33.930 --> 40:35.136
Wait, are you guys leaving?

40:38.390 --> 40:41.052
-Don't worry, they're not going far.
-[gigg|eSI

40:44.440 --> 40:47.398
[Clay]
Yeah, looks //ke
a great house for a party.

40:52.070 --> 40:54.106
Oh, let me get my cash.

40:55.160 --> 40:56.309
How much is it?

40:56.410 --> 41:00.653
Most people pay 60 bucks
for an eighth. I pay 40.

41:12.420 --> 41:15.583
You know what, buddy, fuck it.
Just bring some to my next party.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.170
We'll call it even.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.500
Yeah. Sure.

41:25.100 --> 41:27.307
Hannah Baker told me
about one of your parties.

41:28.980 --> 41:30.311
Hannah Baker.

41:31.480 --> 41:33.186
Sucks what happened to her.

41:34.780 --> 41:35.599
Yeah.

41:36.860 --> 41:38.771
[Bryce]
She was such a beautiful girl.

41:40.620 --> 41:44.078
[giggles] Hey, Zach,
remind me which way to the bathroom.

41:44.790 --> 41:46.781
Here, why don't I show you myself?

41:46.870 --> 41:48.747
-It's like a maze in there.
-Yeah. [laughs]

41:53.590 --> 41:54.796
Thank you.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.656
[jets turn off]

42:25.540 --> 42:29.124
_ I can't believe Hannah Bake_r
finally came to one of my parties.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.377
Well, it looks like it's almost over.

42:32.460 --> 42:35.202
No, not at all.
This is the best time of night.

42:35.300 --> 42:38.212
The drunks are all passed out,
posers are gone.

42:39.590 --> 42:41.717
Only the cool people are left.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.676
And I qualify as "cool people"?

42:44.770 --> 42:46.340
Hell, yeah, you do.

42:46.850 --> 42:48.898
Coolest chick in the junior class.

42:49.850 --> 42:51.147
And the hottest.

42:52.400 --> 42:53.936
Well, uh, I'd better get going.

42:54.030 --> 42:56.681
My parents are probably
super worried by now.

42:56.780 --> 42:57.690
You just got here.

43:07.250 --> 43:08.990
Sorry, I gotta go.

43:09.120 --> 43:09.950
Don't go.

43:11.080 --> 43:13.457
-We're just having fun.
-Bryce!

43:16.670 --> 43:18.297
[gasping]

43:18.840 --> 43:22.424
You and Hannah...
you had sex with her that night.

43:22.760 --> 43:23.840
Did I?

43:24.760 --> 43:25.840
Yeah, I might have.

43:26.560 --> 43:27.970
Did she want you to?

43:29.770 --> 43:31.260
[chuckles] I assume so.

43:32.900 --> 43:34.106
Hannah and I...

43:34.190 --> 43:37.102
Well, she was a very special girl.

43:37.190 --> 43:39.238
We had a thing, off and on.

43:42.740 --> 43:43.866
You raped her.

43:46.580 --> 43:47.399
What?

43:47.910 --> 43:49.116
You fucking raped her.

43:51.170 --> 43:51.989
Dude.

43:53.080 --> 43:55.036
Don't talk about
what you don't know about.

43:55.130 --> 43:56.620
Why did you do it?

43:56.710 --> 43:58.837
Thank you for coming.
Get out of my house.

43:58.920 --> 43:59.966
Not until you admit it.

44:00.050 --> 44:01.790
-Seriously, Jensen.
-Say what you did.

44:01.880 --> 44:04.098
-Say it.
-What business is it of yours?

44:04.180 --> 44:05.420
-She was my friend.
-She's dead.

44:05.510 --> 44:07.808
-What does it matter? Say it.
-Calm the fuck down.

44:07.890 --> 44:10.632
I need what I need,
for you to admit what you did.

44:10.730 --> 44:13.142
Here. Right out there.

44:13.230 --> 44:16.313
A week before she slit her wrists
and died at home, you raped her.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.027
She came to my party.

44:18.780 --> 44:21.192
Mine. She got in the hot tub with me,
without a suit on.

44:21.280 --> 44:23.487
Right? And she made eyes.

44:23.740 --> 44:25.150
[chuckles]

44:25.240 --> 44:29.074
I know that's hard for you to hear,
that your crush wasn't pure and clean.

44:30.790 --> 44:32.701
But she fucking wanted it.

44:43.010 --> 44:44.580
Now, why'd you have to do that?

44:46.800 --> 44:47.630
[grunts]

44:52.560 --> 44:53.470
[wheezing]

44:53.560 --> 44:57.189
All right, come on.
You're okay, you're okay.

44:57.980 --> 44:59.186
Come here.

45:03.450 --> 45:05.566
-[Bryce] No, no, no, no.
-[grunts]

45:05.820 --> 45:06.809
No.

45:07.830 --> 45:10.151
[grunting]

45:13.000 --> 45:13.910
[groans]

45:20.630 --> 45:22.006
She wanted me.

45:23.220 --> 45:24.335
Me.

45:25.130 --> 45:26.882
She was practically
begging me to fuck her.

45:26.970 --> 45:30.212
If that's rape, then every girl
at this school wants to be raped.

45:32.560 --> 45:33.845
[gaSPSI

45:37.520 --> 45:40.899
[Hannah]
The way I see it; there are
two dirferent kinds of death.

45:41.980 --> 45:43.277
[Hannah groaning]

45:44.030 --> 45:47.363
If you ’re lucky,
you live a long life...

45:48.240 --> 45:50.822
and one day your body
stops working and it’s over.

45:51.910 --> 45:52.945
Please, Bryce.

45:53.040 --> 45:55.031
[Bryce] Just relax, just relax.

45:57.580 --> 45:58.410
[groans]

45:58.500 --> 45:59.580
[Bryce whispers] We'll go nice and easy.

45:59.670 --> 46:02.707
[Hannah]
But if you ’re not lucky,
you die a little bit...

46:03.010 --> 46:05.251
[grunting and groaning]

46:05.510 --> 46:06.579
Yeah, that's good.

46:06.760 --> 46:08.216
[Hannah]
...over and over...

46:10.930 --> 46:12.386
[Bryce panting]

46:13.430 --> 46:15.478
...unt/l you realize it’s too late.

46:32.830 --> 46:33.694
[Bryce grunts]

46:57.810 --> 47:01.553
I know some of you might think
there was more I could have done,

47:01.650 --> 47:03.106
or should have done.

47:05.690 --> 47:06.987
But I ’0’ lost control.

47:08.650 --> 47:10.606
And in that moment; it felt l/ke. . .

47:12.530 --> 47:14.862
it felt l/ke I was already dead.

47:25.210 --> 47:26.165
[grunting]

47:57.040 --> 47:58.576
[laughs]

48:02.330 --> 48:03.740
Respect.

48:04.670 --> 48:06.080
Jesus, Jensen.

48:06.170 --> 48:07.501
Respect.

48:56.600 --> 48:57.589
[sighs]

49:01.230 --> 49:02.379
So she wanted it.

49:04.980 --> 49:07.050
She got in the hot tub with you.

49:07.690 --> 49:09.521
And that means she wanted it.

49:09.610 --> 49:10.520
Yeah.

49:10.820 --> 49:11.809
She did.

49:11.900 --> 49:13.527
But she didn't tell you so.

49:13.610 --> 49:15.020
She didn't have to.

49:15.530 --> 49:16.986
Girls play games.

49:18.200 --> 49:21.749
She didn't say
she wanted you to fuck her.

49:21.830 --> 49:23.366
She never said no.

49:23.460 --> 49:24.745
And that's not rape?

49:24.830 --> 49:26.457
Why do you care so much?

49:26.540 --> 49:28.952
I just need to hear you say it.

49:29.040 --> 49:30.667
Jesus, Clay.

49:32.550 --> 49:33.505
I mean...

49:35.220 --> 49:36.130
are you a virgin?

49:37.220 --> 49:38.380
What does that matter?

49:38.470 --> 49:40.301
I'll take that as my answer.

49:40.390 --> 49:43.848
Go get yourself laid a few times, or try.

49:43.930 --> 49:46.979
And then come back to me,
we'll talk like grownups.

49:50.900 --> 49:53.812
Did you rape Hannah Baker?

50:02.490 --> 50:04.993
You wanna call it rape, call it rape.

50:05.080 --> 50:06.320
Same difference.

50:19.300 --> 50:20.790
[screams]

50:22.100 --> 50:23.089
Fuck!

50:23.180 --> 50:24.169

50:25.060 --> 50:27.597
Fuck!

50:28.850 --> 50:30.977
Whoo! [chuckles]

50:48.080 --> 50:49.411
Jesus.

50:50.960 --> 50:52.450
What the hell is this?

50:55.970 --> 50:58.507
-None of your business.
-It is my business.

50:58.590 --> 51:00.501
I got commerce to do here,

51:00.590 --> 51:03.468
which does not work
with the sheriff's department

51:03.560 --> 51:05.380
banging on my door, understand?

51:05.470 --> 51:07.597
No, I don't understand you,

51:07.690 --> 51:09.476
because that's not your fucking door!

51:09.600 --> 51:11.511

51:11.610 --> 51:14.397
You are no fucking good for anybody,
you hear me?

51:14.480 --> 51:16.436
[choking and gasping]

51:16.530 --> 51:18.350
You act like you're above it all...

51:19.030 --> 51:21.567
but you're in deeper than anybody,
it seems like.

51:21.660 --> 51:24.823
No good for your mother,
that girl of yours, not anybody.

51:24.910 --> 51:25.786
-Seth.
-Back.

51:27.750 --> 51:31.163
So, take your shit and go live
with that rich buddy of yours.

51:31.250 --> 51:33.662
Please, the woman next door
will call the cops.

51:35.710 --> 51:36.836
[coughing]

51:39.170 --> 51:40.171
We're done.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.136

52:28.430 --> 52:30.807
["The Killing Moon" playing]

52:53.500 --> 52:57.539
Under blue moon I saw you...

52:59.710 --> 53:02.508

I thought maybe I could forget
about what had happened.

53:02.590 --> 53:08.711
Up in your arms
Too late to beg you or cancel it...

53:08.810 --> 53:10.266
But thanks to you, Bryce...

53:10.350 --> 53:12.887
It must be the k/l/ing time

53:12.980 --> 53:15.346
. . .I’d final/y lived up to my reputation.

53:15.440 --> 53:18.011

53:19.150 --> 53:22.028

I could ever live that down.

53:22.610 --> 53:26.489
Up against your wrl/

53:26.620 --> 53:29.612
But I thought at least maybe
I could set the record straight.

53:30.620 --> 53:32.827
So I started making a list...

53:33.540 --> 53:37.499
trying to piece together just exactly
how my life had gone so wrong.

53:39.290 --> 53:40.871
And the names that came out.

53:51.220 --> 53:53.268
Life is unpredictable...

53:54.140 --> 53:56.096
and control is just an Illusion.

54:16.420 --> 54:20.663
In star/it nights I saw you

Okay. Tell me.

So, I was talking
to a lawyer friend of mine

56:50.650 --> 56:53.403
about these depositions,
and he seems to think--

56:53.490 --> 56:56.402
we'll know more on Monday--
but he seems to think that, uh,

56:56.490 --> 56:58.788
we may be able
to get you out of having to go.

for these parents, kiddo,
