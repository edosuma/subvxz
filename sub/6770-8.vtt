WEBVTT

00:05.171 --> 00:06.239
JANET:
Can I get you some cream?

00:06.306 --> 00:09.008
KELLY:
Yes.

00:09.075 --> 00:11.578
Ooh, here's a list
of caterers.

00:11.644 --> 00:13.646
Oh, by the way, Noah's

00:13.713 --> 00:15.348
going to be moving
some of his stuff

00:15.415 --> 00:16.683
into the beach apartment
tomorrow.

00:18.651 --> 00:19.753
-Is that okay?
-Sure.

00:19.819 --> 00:20.787
Yeah, it's no problem.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.056
Actually, most of my stuff
is over here anyway.

00:23.123 --> 00:26.059
It's just till we can find
a place we can both afford.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.494
Donna, it's okay.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.028
How about calla lilies?

00:29.095 --> 00:29.996
How can I think about flowers

00:30.063 --> 00:31.598
when I haven't even set
a wedding date yet?

00:31.664 --> 00:32.766
Simple-- where's the calendar?

00:32.832 --> 00:35.769
Well, I can't pick a date until
I have a reception hall.

00:35.835 --> 00:38.171
And to do that, I need to know
the number of guests.

00:38.238 --> 00:40.306
Which is pretty hard to do

00:40.373 --> 00:42.742
considering my parents won't
return my phone calls,

00:42.809 --> 00:43.843
Steve's mother is in London,

00:43.910 --> 00:46.513
and Rush is on a singles cruise
to the Panama Canal.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.515
Men are so innocent
when they're sleeping.

00:50.183 --> 00:51.484
Oh, he's my angel.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.086
DONNA:
Aww.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.657
(rock music fades in)

00:57.724 --> 00:59.359
MAN:
Yeah!

00:59.426 --> 01:01.528
(laughing)

01:01.594 --> 01:04.531
Oh, thank you.

01:04.596 --> 01:06.366
Yes!

01:06.433 --> 01:07.801
The best...

01:07.867 --> 01:09.536
ALL:
...bachelor party ...ever!

01:09.602 --> 01:11.704
Yeah!

01:11.771 --> 01:13.406
JANET:
I just need to relax.

01:13.473 --> 01:15.809
You know, get out
of the planning mode

01:15.875 --> 01:16.643
for a little while.

01:16.709 --> 01:18.378
Well, you know,
the groom can help

01:18.445 --> 01:19.846
with some
of the arrangements, too.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.315
Oh, yeah, and Steve is so
detail-oriented.

01:22.382 --> 01:23.683
Bye.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.718
Bye, you guys.
Thank you so much.

01:25.785 --> 01:27.220
Whoo!

01:27.287 --> 01:29.422
-Love it!
-Bachelor!

01:29.489 --> 01:31.691
Olé!

01:31.758 --> 01:33.593
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

01:33.660 --> 01:35.762
Yeah!

01:35.829 --> 01:36.763
JANET (echoing):
<i>Steve... Steve...</i>

01:36.830 --> 01:39.199
<i>Steve...</i>
<i>Steve... Steve... Steve...</i>

01:39.265 --> 01:41.835
Steve, I have a question
about the reception.

01:41.901 --> 01:45.472
What do you think,
beer in bottles or glasses?

Well, I see you have

03:28.575 --> 03:30.577
Why doesn't somebody teach
those kids photography?

03:30.643 --> 03:31.477
That was my dad's hobby.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.178
We've had some interest.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.813
We just don't have a darkroom.

03:33.880 --> 03:38.818
Huh. Darkroom-- one darkroom,
coming right up.

03:38.885 --> 03:42.488
Wow. I come to recruit
volunteers and I get a check.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.525
So don't let too many
nonprofits find out about you.

03:46.593 --> 03:47.961
-(knocking)
-Hi, honey bunny.

03:48.027 --> 03:49.762
Hey.

03:49.829 --> 03:52.932
Gina, this is my friend
Andrew Emery.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.467
He runs the Beverly Glen
Community Center.

03:54.534 --> 03:55.468
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:55.535 --> 03:56.469
-How are you?
-Good.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.271
-Good.
-There you go.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.807
Wow.

04:00.873 --> 04:02.542
Listen, we could
really use your help

04:02.609 --> 04:03.676
with midnight basketball.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.345
I'm trying to get all my donors

04:05.411 --> 04:07.280
involved in one way or another.

04:07.347 --> 04:08.514
I don't know.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.550
I think this is about
as hands-on as I get.

04:10.617 --> 04:13.753
Listen, Miguel and Arturo,
those kids from the hotel,

04:13.820 --> 04:15.588
they still talk about you
all the time.

04:15.655 --> 04:16.689
Yeah, well, they fear me.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.291
Take a day to consider.

04:19.358 --> 04:20.692
-Nice meeting you.
-Oh, great to meet you.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.827
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

04:25.732 --> 04:27.667
-Hi...
-Hi.

04:31.504 --> 04:32.972
I think you should do that.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.340
-Really?
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

04:34.407 --> 04:35.742
You know, only one hard sell
per morning.

04:35.808 --> 04:36.843
That's kind of my rule.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.012
We could volunteer together.

04:39.078 --> 04:40.546
Wow, I didn't think
you were the type.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.381
I really want to do
things together.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.549
You know, couples do
things together.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.485
Well, I tell you what let's do--

04:45.551 --> 04:47.520
you go downstairs and volunteer
us a table.

04:47.587 --> 04:49.055
I'm going to return
some phone calls,

04:49.122 --> 04:51.357
and then I'll come down
and we will have breakfast

04:51.424 --> 04:52.458
as a couple.

04:52.525 --> 04:54.694
-Okay?
-Okay.

04:54.761 --> 04:55.862
All right.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.463
But you're going to think
about it, right?

04:57.530 --> 04:58.464
Sure.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.312
(clears throat)

05:13.379 --> 05:14.347
Your father is a pig.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.650
Can I get some blueberry
pancakes to go, please?

05:17.717 --> 05:19.419
Good morning.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.321
Apparently, Mel was at one of
Gina's little feminist rallies

05:22.388 --> 05:23.489
at the After Dark.

05:23.556 --> 05:24.624
Jackie found out.

05:24.691 --> 05:27.427
And I don't think he got
a duffle bag out of the house.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.861
It's Mel and Jackie.

05:28.928 --> 05:31.064
They break up and get back
together all the time.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.366
Not this time. She's completely
humiliated. It's over.

05:33.433 --> 05:34.767
Hey.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.470
-Hey.
-What's going on?

05:37.537 --> 05:39.806
Well, my daddy looked
at a naked girl,

05:39.872 --> 05:41.741
so Kelly's mommy
kicked him out.

05:41.808 --> 05:43.910
Oh, how'd she find out
about it?

05:43.976 --> 05:45.845
I don't know.
I didn't ask

05:45.912 --> 05:48.381
and Jackie has a little too much
class to offer up.

05:50.783 --> 05:52.885
I'm going to go put
my playlist together.

05:52.952 --> 05:54.821
See you guys later.

05:55.822 --> 05:56.889
I'm just curious.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.625
How much does it cost to
break up a family these days--

05:59.692 --> 06:01.728
40, 50 bucks a lap dance?

06:01.794 --> 06:03.062
It really depends
on the cup size.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.698
No one forced Mel
to come down there.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.133
-Did you see him there?
-No, I didn't.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.167
Oh, look. And by the way,

06:08.234 --> 06:10.536
I wasn't alone on my little
business venture.

06:10.603 --> 06:13.072
Why don't you scold
someone else now?

06:16.109 --> 06:17.443
So, it's moving day.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.746
I got some food
for the troops.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.547
Steve and Matt are
going to help out.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.015
Shouldn't take long
then, should it?

06:23.082 --> 06:24.517
No, no, it shouldn't.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.419
Look, I want to treat
for dinner tonight.

06:26.486 --> 06:27.920
Kind of a roommate
bonding thing, you know.

06:27.987 --> 06:29.055
I said blueberry!

06:30.623 --> 06:32.091
Okay.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.626
(sighs)

06:33.693 --> 06:36.496
Life is just so full of
disappointments, isn't it?

06:36.562 --> 06:38.464
Please go to hell.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.144
I did a good job painting
the room, didn't I?

06:51.210 --> 06:53.579
If I can get the nursery done
in two days,

06:53.646 --> 06:55.848
then we have the rest of the
week for wedding details.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.150
Yeah. You know what,

06:57.216 --> 06:59.118
I'm going to get the
rest of Noah's stuff

06:59.185 --> 07:00.186
over to the beach apartment.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.556
Green is the most restful color,
did you know that?

07:03.623 --> 07:04.490
(voice breaking):
Studies show

07:04.557 --> 07:06.626
that it's beneficial
for teething babies

07:06.692 --> 07:10.429
and soothes stomachaches
in the workplace.

07:10.496 --> 07:13.099
Hey.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.767
Hey, Janet, what's wrong?

07:14.834 --> 07:17.136
I don't want to be
a lumbering bride.

07:17.203 --> 07:20.706
Oh, come on...
you are so beautiful.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.643
When I thought about my wedding
when I was a little girl,

07:23.709 --> 07:25.545
it didn't include
being pregnant.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.648
No wonder people do these things
one at a time.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.552
Everything is going
to be great, I promise.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.086
How?

07:34.153 --> 07:35.688
When our-- our nursery
isn't finished yet,

07:35.755 --> 07:37.123
we don't have a church

07:37.190 --> 07:39.592
and I have stovepipe legs
and swollen hands.

07:39.659 --> 07:42.495
Because I am madly
in love with you.

07:42.562 --> 07:46.732
And neither one of us have
anything to be insecure about.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.570
Thanks.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.738
(sniffs)

07:52.805 --> 07:55.575
I think the green is working.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.776
(chuckles)

07:56.843 --> 07:57.910
Good, good.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.614
Hey, when you get back,

08:01.681 --> 08:02.849
let's set a date.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.084
-Okay?
-Deal.

08:15.294 --> 08:17.530
You know, the chef here
cooked for me

08:17.597 --> 08:19.198
every night for two years.

08:19.265 --> 08:21.033
The only good thing
about breaking up

08:21.100 --> 08:22.635
was reclaiming my waistline.

08:22.702 --> 08:25.504
Well, she obviously knows
her way around a kitchen.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.874
He, actually. Keith.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.776
Okay, give my compliments
to Chef Keith.

08:30.843 --> 08:31.944
Okay.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.712
Listen, Andrew, about, you know,
the center

08:33.779 --> 08:35.548
-and me volunteering?
-Mm-hmm.

08:35.615 --> 08:36.549
I've thought about that.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.850
It's just not me.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.919
Aw, I can't say that's
the answer I'd hoped for.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.888
Well, you know,
I figure I contribute

08:41.953 --> 08:43.089
in the way I can best.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.524
You know, I write checks.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.058
Besides you guys
don't need me around there.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.260
Someone has to be.

08:47.326 --> 08:49.262
I'm quitting at the end
of the month.

08:49.328 --> 08:52.265
This job keeps me in the closet.

08:52.331 --> 08:54.233
I can't do it anymore.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.802
Well, coming out
might be an option.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.537
Lot of people doing it.

08:58.604 --> 09:01.607
Have you ever met my co-director
at the center, Patsy Regan?

09:01.674 --> 09:04.610
Yeah, she seems efficient.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.279
And conservative.

09:06.345 --> 09:08.214
Her son plays for the center's
basketball team.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.882
I think she'd be pretty upset
to learn

09:09.949 --> 09:11.884
that his coach is a real live
homosexual.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.219
Aw, come on, man.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.288
This is the '90s.
You got to be kidding me.

09:15.354 --> 09:17.189
If you can teach the
fundamentals of the game,

09:17.256 --> 09:19.225
who cares whether you're gay
or not?

09:19.292 --> 09:23.329
Locker rooms, showers,
young kids.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.731
Not jumping to any conclusions?

09:25.798 --> 09:27.700
'Cause a lot of people would.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.101
Yeah, well,

09:29.168 --> 09:30.303
I ain't one of them.

09:30.369 --> 09:31.570
-Okay.
-All right?

09:31.637 --> 09:33.773
All right.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.741
What's wrong, faggots?

09:35.808 --> 09:38.778
Couldn't find a room?

09:38.844 --> 09:39.912
Now, you listen there, freak.

09:39.979 --> 09:41.247
I'm going to teach
you guys a lesson

09:41.314 --> 09:42.315
about hanging out in
parking lots.

09:52.191 --> 09:53.626
Somebody call the cops!

09:56.128 --> 09:57.063
You all right?

10:04.437 --> 10:07.773
STEVE: Janet, I was thinking,
how about December 4?

10:07.840 --> 10:10.876
Holy mackerel!

10:10.943 --> 10:13.946
It started to slant
and I couldn't stop.

10:14.013 --> 10:15.381
I'm like a ducky border junkie.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.985
Okay, uh, I'm cutting you off.

10:19.051 --> 10:20.619
We're behind schedule, Steve.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.922
This is supposed to be the
happiest time of my life,

10:22.989 --> 10:24.657
and I can't do it all by myself.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.325
I can tell you're miserable.

10:26.392 --> 10:27.860
Those ducks aren't
going to flap up there

10:27.927 --> 10:29.161
all by themselves, you know.

10:29.228 --> 10:33.232
Okay, honey, you're really doing
a great job,

10:33.299 --> 10:36.235
but I think maybe I should take
it from here, okay? Release.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.436
I think we need a new approach.

10:37.503 --> 10:40.139
Something radically different,
and I've got a great idea.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.207
It involves our friends,

10:41.273 --> 10:44.110
so you're going to have to
trust me on this, okay?

10:44.176 --> 10:46.846
Hmm? Huh?

10:50.449 --> 10:53.185
Yes, thank you, Detective.

10:53.252 --> 10:57.089
The guy that I nabbed isn't
going to give up his buddies.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.859
It would seem the cops need
a statement from you.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.261
Well, they can't have it.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.730
Don't you think you have some
kind of, you know, obligation

11:04.797 --> 11:06.899
to the gay community here?

11:06.966 --> 11:09.235
I was lucky to get in and out
of the hospital quietly.

11:09.301 --> 11:10.836
If I speak out,

11:10.903 --> 11:13.372
it opens a floodgate
of media attention.

11:13.439 --> 11:15.374
Maybe that's not such
a bad thing.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.443
Reporters,
newspaper headlines:

11:17.510 --> 11:21.380
"Gay community center
director bashed."

11:21.447 --> 11:26.285
But here's what people say
off camera:

11:26.352 --> 11:30.156
"Who let that pervert
near our kids?"

11:30.222 --> 11:31.257
Andrew, if you're silent,

11:31.323 --> 11:33.459
th-this kind of thing could
happen to someone else.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.761
If you want to take a stand,

11:35.828 --> 11:38.364
make the statement
for both of us.

11:41.233 --> 11:42.802
Hi.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.373
Oh, what happened to you?

11:47.440 --> 11:48.441
Are you okay?

11:48.507 --> 11:52.311
In a car wreck.
Everyone's fine.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.312
Oh, good.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.082
Could you give us,
just, um, a minute, Gina?

11:56.148 --> 11:59.718
-Sure. -Oh, that's all right.
I-I was just leaving.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.292
What happened to your arm?

12:06.358 --> 12:08.761
Oh, nothing.

12:08.828 --> 12:12.098
I, uh, I got in a fight.

12:12.164 --> 12:14.200
Oh. Who'd you punch this time?

12:14.266 --> 12:16.502
I don't really want
to talk about it.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.171
Okay.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.942
Listen, my mom called.

12:23.008 --> 12:24.243
DYLAN:
Hmm.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.378
I guess there's some
two-for-one special going

12:26.445 --> 12:27.746
from L.A. to Denver.

12:27.813 --> 12:30.449
Feel like taking a little trip?

12:30.516 --> 12:32.952
Since when do you want to spend
time with Bobbi?

12:33.018 --> 12:34.120
Yeah, I know.

12:34.186 --> 12:37.923
It's just that she invited me.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.493
Us, actually.

12:40.559 --> 12:42.394
You barely talk about her.

12:42.461 --> 12:43.429
I'm sorry. Never mind.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.330
Stupid idea.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.968
Do you know
my favorite color, Dylan?

12:49.034 --> 12:50.402
Or, um, I don't know,

12:50.469 --> 12:52.238
who my first boyfriend was?

12:52.304 --> 12:54.874
I know everything about you.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.142
I'm tired, Gina.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.409
Because I ask. And then when

12:57.476 --> 13:00.212
you answer me,
I hang on your every word.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.148
(voice breaking):
See, the difference between

13:02.214 --> 13:05.284
me and you is that...

13:05.351 --> 13:07.453
I'm in love with you.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.056
That's not fair.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.359
No kidding.

13:18.164 --> 13:19.899
(door opens, shuts)

13:32.511 --> 13:34.313
You guys are
all probably wondering why

13:34.380 --> 13:35.314
we called you here.

13:35.381 --> 13:36.415
With no advance notice.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.984
It's because you're all going
on a scavenger hunt.

13:39.051 --> 13:41.353
You are required to drive
around, find certain items,

13:41.420 --> 13:43.589
maybe do something in
a specific location.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.690
Everyone's on a team,

13:44.757 --> 13:47.126
and each team works together
to figure out the clues.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.094
And each clue leads
to another clue,

13:49.161 --> 13:51.430
and the scavenger hunt
leads to the party.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.365
-What party?
-Well, with all the craziness

13:53.432 --> 13:54.466
of planning for the baby

13:54.533 --> 13:56.869
and the wedding, we kinda forgot
about the fun stuff.

13:56.936 --> 13:59.438
Yeah, so we figured we'd pool
all our showers

13:59.505 --> 14:01.340
and bachelorette parties
and bachelor parties together

14:01.407 --> 14:02.374
and carouse with you guys.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.009
Can't you just, you know,

14:04.076 --> 14:05.911
tell us where
the clambake is, and...?

14:05.978 --> 14:08.080
No! But if you get lost,
there'll be

14:08.147 --> 14:09.148
an emergency phone number.

14:09.215 --> 14:10.216
No cheating.

14:10.282 --> 14:11.317
And you are

14:11.383 --> 14:12.318
financially responsible

14:12.384 --> 14:13.586
for your own traffic violations.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.854
But remember, this is a race.

14:15.921 --> 14:17.156
What does the winner get?

14:17.223 --> 14:18.891
Well, it's gonna be a surprise,

14:18.958 --> 14:20.492
but we think
you're gonna love it

14:20.559 --> 14:24.463
Are you guys ready?
Okay, car one, Donna and Matt.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.265
Car two, David, Kelly and Noah.

14:26.332 --> 14:27.433
Perfect.

14:27.499 --> 14:28.734
Car three, Gina and Dylan.

14:28.801 --> 14:32.571
Each box contains the first clue
plus all the tools you'll need.

14:35.641 --> 14:37.042
Ready, set, go.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.511
Trust no one! Check the kit
in the car! Run!

14:39.578 --> 14:40.713
(Nat laughs)

14:40.779 --> 14:43.649
"You could never duplicate
the love Steve and Janet share,

14:43.716 --> 14:46.952
though this establishment
on Olympic and Doheny may try."

14:47.019 --> 14:48.354
There's a mall there.

14:48.420 --> 14:51.523
Yeah, Khalid's Copy Mat.

14:51.590 --> 14:52.558
"Duplicate the love."

14:52.625 --> 14:54.560
DAVID:
Dupli...

14:54.627 --> 14:57.363
Map...
All right, let's go.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.606
Copy Center? What's, what's up
with that, huh?

15:07.673 --> 15:09.675
(chuckles)

15:11.377 --> 15:13.012
What?

15:13.078 --> 15:14.513
Okay, let's just pretend
like nothing's happening.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.482
Kelly, I just-I don't want to
get into it, all right?

15:16.548 --> 15:19.151
How many times do you think
Mel has cheated on Jackie?

15:19.218 --> 15:21.587
I don't know how many times.
I have no idea.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.555
David, you have sided
with my mom every time.

15:23.622 --> 15:25.024
This is no different.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.292
Yeah, it is different.

15:26.358 --> 15:29.428
Last time he cheated, all right,
he got a lap dance. Big deal.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.696
Oh, that's so comforting.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.264
(David sighs)

15:32.331 --> 15:34.566
You know, your mom is-is
the one who's breaking up

15:34.633 --> 15:36.602
the family, all right?
Not Mel.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.137
Because she is sick of it.

15:38.203 --> 15:39.505
She's sick of him eyeing
every salesgirl,

15:39.571 --> 15:40.572
every waitress that walks by.

15:40.639 --> 15:42.541
Some of them were dancers,
not prostitutes, Kel.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.611
What exactly was the dancer-
to-prostitute ratio?

15:45.678 --> 15:47.479
Because knowing that,
I think, would make

15:47.546 --> 15:50.282
me and my mom and my little
sister feel so much better.

15:52.751 --> 15:55.154
Yeah.

15:59.491 --> 16:02.628
Okay, "You could never duplicate
the love Steve and Janet share,

16:02.695 --> 16:04.997
though this establishment
on Olympic and Doheny may try."

16:05.064 --> 16:06.565
Mm-hmm. Ah, a clue.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.634
Must be the right place.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.972
"If we had one of these,

16:14.039 --> 16:15.607
"maybe we could schedule
our lives better.

16:15.674 --> 16:18.577
"Show off the gifts that God
gave you by making a calendar.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.179
"One body part for each month.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.414
"Then ask the clerk
for the next clue.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.483
P.S. Extra points
for photocopying your butt."

16:24.550 --> 16:26.518
My butt?!
Your butt, mister.

16:26.585 --> 16:27.419
-Your butt.
-Oh, you...

16:27.486 --> 16:31.490
How do you go about making
a calendar?

16:42.334 --> 16:43.635
Oh! Mmm!

16:43.702 --> 16:44.737
DONNA:
Ow!

16:44.803 --> 16:46.238
Ah!

17:03.122 --> 17:05.758
(groans)

17:05.824 --> 17:08.761
Kel, um, I'm gonna ask
you a question.

17:08.827 --> 17:11.296
Does, does torturing him
make you feel better?

17:11.363 --> 17:13.531
A little, yeah.

17:13.598 --> 17:17.136
You think you might want
to ease up a little?

17:18.637 --> 17:20.305
Hey, got a second?

17:20.372 --> 17:21.807
All right, listen,
I'll back the car up

17:21.874 --> 17:23.275
and point it towards the street.

17:23.342 --> 17:25.377
Good man! Go!

17:25.444 --> 17:26.744
You've gotta switch cars
with me.

17:26.811 --> 17:28.247
Why, what's going on?

17:28.313 --> 17:29.748
I don't know.
Kelly's acting really weird.

17:29.815 --> 17:32.084
-Oh!
-Switch with me, okay?

17:32.151 --> 17:33.685
Fine! Matt, come back!

17:33.752 --> 17:36.188
And this is just because
David's a fast driver, okay?

17:36.255 --> 17:38.490
-Okay. Mmm. -Listen, you and
Kelly are roommates for now,

17:38.557 --> 17:39.525
so you gotta try and get along.

17:39.591 --> 17:41.593
That's what I want to do.
I want to get along.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.596
Fine. Aah! (grunting)

17:44.663 --> 17:46.098
Looks like you boys have

17:46.165 --> 17:48.767
some photocopying to do,
suckers!

17:48.834 --> 17:50.402
NOAH:
Hey, come on!

17:50.469 --> 17:51.403
Team change.

17:51.470 --> 17:52.438
DAVID:
Team change?

17:52.504 --> 17:53.672
Why? Noah not having fun?

17:53.739 --> 17:55.707
I think he just gets carsick
in the back seat or something.

17:55.774 --> 17:56.775
You guys want to win, right?!

17:56.842 --> 17:58.210
Winning is our mantra.

17:58.277 --> 17:59.578
Win, win, win... win!

17:59.645 --> 18:00.846
All right, clue three:

18:00.913 --> 18:03.348
"'Tis the season
to be jolly, almost.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.184
"Visit the house that leads
the neighborhood

18:05.250 --> 18:06.485
in holiday spirit"

18:06.552 --> 18:08.821
Oh, isn't that that freaky
family on Collins Street

18:08.887 --> 18:10.789
that, like, puts up their
decorations in early November?

18:10.856 --> 18:12.491
I think so, I think so.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.327
"Appropriate some decorating
as you're knowing full well

18:15.394 --> 18:17.629
they'll be returned
at the end of the hunt."

18:17.696 --> 18:19.398
You have to steal
someone's yule log?

18:19.465 --> 18:21.166
No, it's says in there
we return it.

18:21.233 --> 18:22.167
Yeah, it's a loan.

18:22.234 --> 18:23.435
DAVID:
Yeah, it's a loan.

18:23.502 --> 18:25.637
As long as it's not a nativity
scene, whatever.

18:25.704 --> 18:27.439
Back to the car. Chop, chop!

18:31.710 --> 18:33.745
Why don't you get a CD player
in this thing?

18:33.812 --> 18:35.747
I can never find a stupid
radio station.

18:35.814 --> 18:36.849
Well, we're supposed
to be looking

18:36.915 --> 18:38.350
for a copy center right now.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.885
(gasps) Oh, look at
the little dog!

18:39.952 --> 18:41.420
-What?
-Look! Pull over, pull over!

18:41.487 --> 18:42.721
We have to get him.
Look, he's crossing the street.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.655
Dylan pull over.

18:43.722 --> 18:44.823
-No.
Yes, he's gonna get hit!

18:44.890 --> 18:46.492
Gina, dogs take walks
all the time.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.660
-Dylan, we have to pick him up!
-I'll call Animal Control.

18:48.727 --> 18:49.561
No, you can't call
Animal Control.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.596
Are you crazy?

18:50.662 --> 18:51.530
They'll put him to sleep.

18:51.597 --> 18:52.598
-Would you stop the car, please?
-For what?

18:52.664 --> 18:55.601
So we can take him back
to the hotel and feed him.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.636
Hey, no, no,
we are not getting a dog.

18:57.703 --> 18:59.404
(sarcastic chuckle)
Yes, sir.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.707
Oh, I guess that would
actually be doing

19:01.773 --> 19:03.208
something together,
wouldn't it?

19:03.275 --> 19:04.576
When this is over,
we'll go home...

19:04.643 --> 19:05.744
When this is over, what, Dylan?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.479
We're gonna go home and have sex

19:07.546 --> 19:09.648
and continue to ignore
the distance between us?

19:09.715 --> 19:11.617
Sounds amazing.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.221
All right, clue number three.
You ready?

19:16.288 --> 19:17.456
Number three, go ahead.

19:17.523 --> 19:20.225
"Appropriate some decorating
as your own,

19:20.292 --> 19:21.793
"knowing full well
it'll be returned

19:21.860 --> 19:24.162
at the end of the hunt."

19:24.229 --> 19:25.764
Smells like a felony to me.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.467
Oh, my God, dude,
have you looked in here?

19:28.534 --> 19:30.669
Check her out.

19:30.736 --> 19:31.870
(laughs)

19:31.937 --> 19:34.773
Oh, God, suddenly, stealing
someone's personal property

19:34.840 --> 19:35.841
seems rather tame.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.711
What are you doing?

19:39.778 --> 19:41.780
What do you mean
what am I doing?

19:41.847 --> 19:44.950
You know how long it takes
to blow one of these things up?

19:45.017 --> 19:48.420
Buddy, please, I'm just guessing
it takes a while, okay?

19:48.487 --> 19:49.488
Yeah.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.264
Hello, Officer.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.668
How you doing?

20:02.734 --> 20:05.671
This is just a, uh, just a toy,
like a joke, you know?

20:05.737 --> 20:07.406
We're just, uh,
just riding around.

20:07.472 --> 20:10.776
Uh, you probably want me
to pull over, don't you?

20:20.852 --> 20:23.722
All right, ladies,
make it quick.

20:23.789 --> 20:26.291
KELLY:
David?

20:26.358 --> 20:28.527
What?
What if something goes down?

20:28.594 --> 20:30.796
We're gonna need
a getaway driver, right?

20:32.664 --> 20:34.633
Donna, you want to keep
our lead or not?

20:40.806 --> 20:44.376
DONNA:
Ow!

20:44.443 --> 20:45.711
KELLY:
Ah.

20:46.778 --> 20:50.248
May I help you girls?

20:50.315 --> 20:52.718
(nervously):
Um, hi. How you doing?

20:52.784 --> 20:56.622
Uh, we're from the Neighborhood
Council for Overdone Decorating,

20:56.688 --> 20:58.256
and you're under investigation.

20:58.323 --> 21:01.660
Yeah, we need to borrow
some of your lights.

21:01.727 --> 21:04.630
And a little bit
of tinsel, just for

21:04.696 --> 21:05.764
the council to look over.

21:05.831 --> 21:06.832
And approve.

21:06.898 --> 21:08.667
Possibly award.

21:08.734 --> 21:09.701
Don't BS me, young ladies!

21:09.768 --> 21:11.336
What is this all about?

21:11.403 --> 21:14.039
We're on a scavenger hunt.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.709
I met my husband
on one of those!

21:17.776 --> 21:18.777
Oh!

21:18.844 --> 21:19.845
Are you winning?

21:19.911 --> 21:21.046
Oh, we're killing them!

21:25.617 --> 21:26.652
-Oh, no!
-Eek!

21:26.718 --> 21:27.653
Don't just stand there!

21:27.719 --> 21:28.787
DAVID:
You guys having fun yet?

21:28.854 --> 21:30.589
DYLAN:
Yeah, tons.

21:30.656 --> 21:33.825
There was a sweet little dog,
he almost got hit by a car,

21:33.892 --> 21:35.994
and he wouldn't even stop
to help him.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.370
Where was it?

21:45.437 --> 21:48.974
Just right off of Wilshire,
like, two blocks away.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.676
Hey, why don't you guys
wait for us.

21:50.742 --> 21:52.644
We're gonna go check
on something.

21:52.711 --> 21:53.879
Tell you what-- you go ahead;

21:53.945 --> 21:55.681
Donna and Kelly can ride
with me.

21:55.747 --> 21:57.549
KELLY:
Are you sure?

21:57.616 --> 21:59.518
Yeah.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.319
Uh, what about Gina?

22:01.386 --> 22:02.487
(sighs)

22:02.554 --> 22:04.389
All right,
let's get the damn dog.

22:04.456 --> 22:05.457
Gina!

22:06.625 --> 22:07.626
Are we going?

22:07.693 --> 22:08.794
(car door shuts, engine starts)

22:13.498 --> 22:15.500
You're all about winning, right?

22:26.144 --> 22:28.613
Okay, "Take a load off
at the mattress store on Maple.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.349
"Choose a favorite bed, and
photograph the relaxing moment

22:31.416 --> 22:33.385
"with your team
and the store manager.

22:33.452 --> 22:34.820
"Think you can do this one
in your sleep?

22:34.886 --> 22:37.022
The enclosed prop
must be in the photo, too."

22:39.057 --> 22:40.559
Ooh.

22:42.561 --> 22:43.495
Oh.

22:43.562 --> 22:44.830
Dylan, I believe
these are yours.

22:44.896 --> 22:46.798
Yeah, think again.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.101
I think that store's on
Third and Maple.

22:49.167 --> 22:50.769
The gas is
the pedal to the right.

22:50.836 --> 22:51.770
Hit it.

22:51.837 --> 22:53.705
(cell phone ringing)

22:53.772 --> 22:55.373
Yeah?

22:55.440 --> 22:57.576
Hey. It's Andrew.

22:57.642 --> 22:58.977
They caught the other guys.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.480
They need you at a lineup
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.482
Well, don't you think you should
be there to identify them

23:03.548 --> 23:05.650
and point out
what they did was wrong?

23:05.717 --> 23:07.052
So, do you need
the detective's number?

23:07.119 --> 23:10.455
No, I got his card.

23:10.522 --> 23:11.289
What's going on?

23:11.356 --> 23:12.791
Why do you have a brace
on your wrist?

23:12.858 --> 23:14.493
Let's just say I had
a bad day yesterday,

23:14.559 --> 23:16.161
and I don't really feel
much like a scavenger hunt,

23:16.228 --> 23:17.863
-all right?
-Yeah, we noticed.

23:17.929 --> 23:20.098
And, apparently, so did Gina.

23:20.165 --> 23:22.901
Which is too bad, because
if you try, it's more fun--

23:22.968 --> 23:24.436
across the board.

23:24.503 --> 23:25.737
Relationships, too.

23:25.804 --> 23:28.406
So now you two
are concerned about Gina?

23:28.473 --> 23:29.875
Well, if you can't spend
an hour in a car,

23:29.941 --> 23:30.876
what are you two doing together?

23:30.942 --> 23:31.943
Having fun.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.713
That's enough for me.

23:34.780 --> 23:35.814
Dylan, you've been
married before.

23:35.881 --> 23:38.884
You know what it's like
to be with the right person.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.852
I'm surprised
you'd settle for less.

23:45.957 --> 23:47.659
-You know, she almost got hit.
-There's a tag,

23:47.726 --> 23:49.427
but there's no name
or address or anything on it.

23:49.494 --> 23:50.762
-Yeah.
-Well, there's a license number.

23:50.829 --> 23:51.763
That should help.

23:51.830 --> 23:53.698
We'll take care of her. Come on.

23:53.765 --> 23:54.699
Yeah?

23:54.766 --> 23:55.801
Okay, bye.

23:55.867 --> 23:56.802
Bye.

23:56.868 --> 23:58.703
-Sweetie.
-Bye-bye.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.709
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where you going?

24:04.776 --> 24:05.944
We have to make sure she's okay.

24:06.011 --> 24:07.846
We have to wait.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.583
Can't believe she was
running around like that

24:11.650 --> 24:13.752
all by herself, you know?

24:13.819 --> 24:14.786
Dylan didn't even care.

24:14.853 --> 24:17.989
I invited him home
to meet my mom, he said no.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.929
I'm sorry. That must have been
really hard for you.

24:23.995 --> 24:26.464
Yeah, it's not like
I exactly jump at the chance

24:26.531 --> 24:29.000
to show someone
the shoe box I grew up in.

24:29.067 --> 24:31.069
I'm sure it will all work out.

24:35.273 --> 24:37.776
Thanks for helping me
get the dog.

24:37.843 --> 24:39.578
You didn't even care
that she was a mess.

24:39.644 --> 24:40.879
You know as well as I do,

24:40.946 --> 24:43.481
you'd rather Dylan was here
with you than me.

24:45.884 --> 24:47.886
I wish he was more like you.

24:58.697 --> 25:01.166
DONNA:
Come on!

25:01.233 --> 25:02.701
I'm not ashamed.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.502
(camera whirring)

25:04.569 --> 25:05.704
Sorry, your flap was open.

25:05.770 --> 25:07.172
Move, people, move!

25:07.239 --> 25:08.106
Oh.

25:14.079 --> 25:15.113
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.548
Can I help you?

25:16.615 --> 25:17.883
Yeah, look, I can tell
you're a busy man,

25:17.949 --> 25:19.117
so I'm just gonna
get right to it.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.887
What are the chances of you
and me laying down on that bed?

25:21.953 --> 25:23.755
You and me there?

25:23.822 --> 25:24.689
Quickly--
it's for a good cause.

25:24.756 --> 25:25.724
Yeah, it would mean so much.

25:25.790 --> 25:27.292
He was neglected
as a child and...

25:27.359 --> 25:29.194
Well, it's against
company policy or...

25:29.261 --> 25:30.862
Had to go to the neighbors
for a hug.

25:30.929 --> 25:32.130
It'd be a big breakthrough.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.765
All right, listen, if I do this,

25:33.832 --> 25:35.734
will you leave,
quietly and immediately?

25:35.800 --> 25:36.735
-Promise.
-Oh, yeah.

25:36.801 --> 25:37.736
Okay.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.537
Uh, just-just don't mind her.

25:39.604 --> 25:40.805
-Go ahead, jump.
-(man groans)

25:40.872 --> 25:41.806
Good one.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.708
Where's the damn clue?

25:43.775 --> 25:44.676
-Smile.
-What am I...?

25:44.743 --> 25:46.745
Oh, yeah.

25:46.811 --> 25:48.780
Got it, I got it!

25:48.847 --> 25:49.781
Where you going?

25:49.848 --> 25:50.849
-I, uh...
-Relax.

25:50.916 --> 25:51.683
Okay.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.585
"Make history.
This clue will lead you

25:53.652 --> 25:55.687
"to the park where Janet,
our little math maven,

25:55.754 --> 25:57.188
"circled the classified ad

25:57.255 --> 25:59.090
that brought her to
the <i> Beverly Beat</i> and Steve."

25:59.157 --> 25:59.991
What are you doing?

26:00.058 --> 26:01.760
What, you think
only boys can do math?

26:01.826 --> 26:02.794
-(cell phone ringing)
-Oh. Stop fighting.

26:02.861 --> 26:03.762
-I'll get it.
-Get off me.

26:03.828 --> 26:05.730
-Do you know you got to
carry the two? -Hello.

26:05.797 --> 26:06.898
Yeah, it's Noah. Is Donna there?

26:06.965 --> 26:07.899
DONNA:
Where are you?

26:07.966 --> 26:09.067
I'm at the Christmas house.

26:09.134 --> 26:12.270
We've already had
one run-in with the law.

26:12.337 --> 26:14.072
Something tells me
we're about to have a second.

26:14.139 --> 26:15.273
Wouldn't that be a third,

26:15.340 --> 26:17.042
including your little
erotic dancing bust?

26:17.108 --> 26:18.009
Can I talk to Donna?

26:18.076 --> 26:19.244
No. She's busy.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.946
Kel, give me the phone.

26:21.012 --> 26:22.647
(door opens)

26:22.714 --> 26:23.715
Might as well give up.

26:23.782 --> 26:26.217
My girl Donna's gonna win.

26:26.284 --> 26:28.620
-(door closes)
-Do you or Matt have

26:28.687 --> 26:30.722
that emergency number
that Steve and Janet passed out?

26:30.789 --> 26:31.690
-Yeah.
-Call them.

26:31.756 --> 26:32.958
Say you're a quitter,

26:33.024 --> 26:34.693
and they'll tell you
where to go, okay?

26:34.759 --> 26:37.696
(dial tone)

26:37.762 --> 26:38.596
Was that Noah?

26:38.663 --> 26:39.731
Yes.

26:39.798 --> 26:40.899
STORE MANAGER:
I did really well on

26:40.966 --> 26:43.101
my math S.A.T.'s. I...

26:43.168 --> 26:45.003
(wry laugh)
Yeah, I'm very proud.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.938
Uh, wh... what's your problem
with my boyfriend?

26:47.005 --> 26:47.939
You really want to know?

26:48.006 --> 26:50.375
I think he cuts corners
to get what he wants.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.777
Like running a strip joint
for extra cash.

26:52.844 --> 26:55.747
15,488.

26:55.814 --> 26:57.749
15,488 what?

26:57.816 --> 26:58.383
(grunts)

26:58.450 --> 27:00.085
Sunset Boulevard.

27:00.151 --> 27:02.654
Yep, if you want
to go to the party.

27:02.721 --> 27:03.822
Oh, you're good!

27:03.888 --> 27:04.823
-Here we go!
-Go!

27:08.326 --> 27:09.794
Oh.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.164
She okay?

27:13.231 --> 27:15.000
Well, she's dehydrated
and malnourished.

27:15.066 --> 27:17.135
She's been on her own
for a while.

27:17.202 --> 27:18.303
Well, I'm gonna take her home.

27:18.370 --> 27:19.371
Actually, she's been
reported missing.

27:19.437 --> 27:20.739
We ran the license number

27:20.805 --> 27:22.807
on her collar.
Her name is Joan,

27:22.874 --> 27:24.776
and her owner's on the way.

27:24.843 --> 27:26.778
I thought you'd want
to say good-bye.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.413
Uh, wait a minute-- you're gonna
return her to the people

27:28.480 --> 27:30.648
who let her run around
in traffic?

27:30.715 --> 27:32.684
I mean, that's not the way you
treat something you love, is it?

27:32.751 --> 27:34.686
Who'd name their dog Joan?

27:36.888 --> 27:38.690
There's my number.

27:38.757 --> 27:40.825
If they'd like
to discuss her future,

27:40.892 --> 27:41.826
they can call me.

27:41.893 --> 27:42.827
Come on, sweetie.

27:44.829 --> 27:47.098
(chuckles)

27:47.165 --> 27:49.768
Hey, how'd you guys
get here so fast?

27:49.834 --> 27:51.836
Have I mentioned I don't even
like crossword puzzles?

27:51.903 --> 27:53.438
-(chuckles)
-And that Christmas house lady--

27:53.505 --> 27:54.839
-very, very scary.
-Oh.

27:54.906 --> 27:56.007
Turns out, we couldn't even
find a clue,

27:56.074 --> 27:57.308
so I had to call Janet and Steve

27:57.375 --> 28:00.445
and beg them for mercy.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.679
That means...

28:01.746 --> 28:02.680
Mm-hmm.

28:02.747 --> 28:04.215
Yes! I'm the winner!

28:04.282 --> 28:05.183
(chuckling)

28:05.250 --> 28:07.452
-Oh, I mean, we are victorious.
-Thank you.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.187
-We're all the winners together.
We did it. -Mm-hmm.

28:09.254 --> 28:11.256
Wait, how did all these
decorations get here?

28:11.322 --> 28:12.223
Is this the end of the road?

28:12.290 --> 28:13.925
Please tell me this is
the end of the road.

28:13.992 --> 28:15.460
I don't know.
Where's Janet and Steve?

28:15.527 --> 28:17.195
Uh, better yet, where's the dog?

28:17.262 --> 28:18.430
Oh, she's in the car.

28:18.496 --> 28:21.232
In fact, David said that she
could stay at his house until

28:21.299 --> 28:22.801
-I find a home.
-Really?

28:22.867 --> 28:24.069
You or the dog?

28:24.135 --> 28:26.271
I don't know. We're both looking
for something more permanent.

28:26.337 --> 28:27.739
Hello, you guys.

28:27.806 --> 28:29.140
A clue, right there.

28:29.207 --> 28:30.141
Walked right by it.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.810
(chuckles)

28:31.876 --> 28:32.811
Okay.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.913
"Established in 1919,

28:34.979 --> 28:37.749
"this is one of the oldest parks
in Los Angeles.

28:37.816 --> 28:39.851
"It served as a backdrop
for many movie love scenes,

28:39.918 --> 28:43.321
and today it unites two and
a half people for all time."

28:43.388 --> 28:45.056
That's it?
W-What's the question?

28:45.123 --> 28:46.458

28:59.170 --> 29:00.839
Congratulations.

29:00.905 --> 29:01.906

29:01.973 --> 29:02.974
You made it.

29:09.514 --> 29:10.448
(music ends)

29:10.515 --> 29:13.518
We are gathered here,
in the presence of God,

29:13.585 --> 29:18.156
to witness the marriage
of Steve and Janet.

29:18.223 --> 29:19.491
Surprise.

29:19.557 --> 29:21.759
We hope you guys don't feel
tricked into coming.

29:24.129 --> 29:26.131
Would you like to join hands?

29:31.336 --> 29:32.470
I, Steve,

29:32.537 --> 29:34.105
take you, Janet...

29:35.073 --> 29:36.141
To be my wife.

29:36.207 --> 29:37.876
...to be my wife.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.311
And I promise...

29:40.378 --> 29:42.814
Before God and these witnesses.

29:42.881 --> 29:45.917
...before God
and these witnesses...

29:53.191 --> 29:56.427
in front of the people
who mean the most to me,

29:56.494 --> 29:59.797
to love you
for the rest of my life.

29:59.864 --> 30:03.301
You have given me
so much to be thankful for.

30:03.368 --> 30:08.072
For you, for our family...

30:08.139 --> 30:10.575
I will fill our lives
with love and devotion.

30:10.642 --> 30:15.280
And in these arms,
you will always have shelter.

30:15.346 --> 30:18.983
And in my heart,
you will always have a home.

30:20.385 --> 30:23.488
You have showed me
the true meaning of partnership

30:23.555 --> 30:27.091
and helped make me
a better person.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.593
Oh, my gosh.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.028

30:31.362 --> 30:33.598
My life has changed

30:33.665 --> 30:36.501
so much since I've known you.

30:36.568 --> 30:39.003
You make me laugh.

30:39.070 --> 30:40.905
I love you.
You make me so happy.

30:42.073 --> 30:44.876
I take you as my husband.

30:44.943 --> 30:49.447

With this ring,
I make you my husband.

31:19.410 --> 31:21.412
And join my life with yours.

31:22.447 --> 31:24.415
And with this ring,

31:24.482 --> 31:26.117
I do the same.

31:32.690 --> 31:34.892
By the authority vested in me,

31:34.959 --> 31:39.664

husband and wife.

you guys pulled it off.

32:03.688 --> 32:05.590
-It was very fun.
-That park's been a landmark

32:05.657 --> 32:07.225

Oh, it would've been great.

of Trinas out there.

39:28.866 --> 39:29.734
But Kelly wouldn't listen to me,

39:29.800 --> 39:31.669
so I told her the story
about this woman.

39:31.736 --> 39:33.471
-Who you made up.
-You asked me

39:33.537 --> 39:34.505
to patch things up with Kelly.

39:34.572 --> 39:35.606
That's what I'm doing.

39:37.441 --> 39:38.509
Who is it hurting, anyway?

39:39.810 --> 39:41.779
To Steve and Janet.

39:51.088 --> 39:55.092
I was glad you called,
'cause I was wondering, uh,

39:55.159 --> 39:58.529
what did you tell the people
at the center? -Thanks.

39:58.596 --> 40:02.500
That I'd been in a fender bender
and I need a few days off.

40:02.566 --> 40:06.871
Patsy, my co-director,
came by the house.

40:06.937 --> 40:10.741
My partner, Miles,
answered the door...

40:10.808 --> 40:12.810
to our one-bedroom apartment.

40:12.877 --> 40:15.679
Yeah, well, the old, uh,

40:15.746 --> 40:17.515
(chuckles)
"he's just my roommate" thing

40:17.581 --> 40:18.616
didn't work, huh?

40:18.682 --> 40:21.752
You know, when I...
I said it was a car accident,

40:21.819 --> 40:24.722
Patsy never even asked
if it was my fault,

40:24.789 --> 40:27.057
but when I said
I'd been gay-bashed,

40:27.124 --> 40:29.627
she looked at me
like I had asked for it.

40:29.693 --> 40:31.462
Give her some time to adjust.

40:31.529 --> 40:32.997
Oh, she suggested time, as well.

40:33.063 --> 40:35.900
I said I'd be back to work
on Monday, but she...

40:35.966 --> 40:39.503
urged me to take a few weeks--
minimum.

40:39.570 --> 40:41.705
In fact, she insisted.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.742
You knew that you'd have a fight
on your hands.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.678
I need some sleep.

40:47.745 --> 40:50.714
I got to look
for a job tomorrow.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.618
(grunts)

40:54.685 --> 40:57.221
Listen, uh... thanks.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.689
Take it easy.

41:01.258 --> 41:04.695
(door opens and closes)

41:24.715 --> 41:26.250
(knocking on door)

41:28.819 --> 41:31.021
I was on my way to Matt's,
and I realized,

41:31.088 --> 41:33.724
there were no pictures taken
of me in my wedding gown.

41:33.791 --> 41:37.862
Yeah, well, uh,
I never said I saw any pictures.

41:40.231 --> 41:43.634
Yeah, you said you saw me
in my wedding gown.

41:43.701 --> 41:45.502
But you weren't there.

41:46.770 --> 41:49.940
You wore a, uh,
low-cut white thing.

41:50.007 --> 41:51.842
It was... it was puffy.

41:53.277 --> 41:56.080
That pretty much describes
just about every bride.

41:56.146 --> 41:57.181
(sighs)

41:57.248 --> 41:58.749
Okay.

41:58.816 --> 42:01.118
Um, your hair was up.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.686
It was curly.

42:03.854 --> 42:05.823
I always thought
you should have left it down.

42:06.991 --> 42:08.926
I can't believe you were there.

42:08.993 --> 42:11.662
I flew in from Europe
at the last minute.

42:13.697 --> 42:14.565
I was coming up the path

42:14.632 --> 42:17.268
in the back of the church,
and I saw you.

42:17.334 --> 42:20.004
You left without saying hello
to me or your friends?

42:20.070 --> 42:22.172
Well, then it hit me.

42:22.239 --> 42:25.309
I realized that you were going
to marry someone else,

42:25.376 --> 42:28.846
and, uh...
I didn't want to see that.

42:31.115 --> 42:33.717
Weren't you
on your way to Matt's?

42:37.254 --> 42:39.023
Maybe I shouldn't
have brought that up, huh?

42:41.892 --> 42:43.661
Probably not.
