WEBVTT

00:05.200 --> 00:06.560
...something they had never seen,

00:06.640 --> 00:07.920
which liberated a yellow,

00:08.000 --> 00:09.720
very pungent and acrid vapor.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.320
The actions of the hardline military regime

00:11.440 --> 00:13.960
are the cause of increasing
international concern.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.800
The regime crushes all dissent.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.560
Ethnic groups are being oppressed

00:17.680 --> 00:18.760
in the east of the country,

00:19.040 --> 00:20.600
and foreign journalists are rarely...

00:20.680 --> 00:22.080
...claim tonight

00:22.200 --> 00:23.520
that some form of chemical weapon

00:23.840 --> 00:25.360
has been used in Burma
by military rulers...

00:25.440 --> 00:27.240
...has led to the national uprising.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.840
Thousands took to the streets,

00:28.960 --> 00:30.840
- and thousands were killed
- In Burma,

00:30.920 --> 00:32.600
- by the Burmese military.
- protesting monks have been killed...

00:32.720 --> 00:34.840
some burned alive,
and others drowned.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.880
Foreign journalists
have been shot and killed.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.800
...as thousands of villages
have been destroyed,

00:38.880 --> 00:40.640
rape and torture
are a daily occurrence.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.360
In Burma, there are more landmines

00:42.440 --> 00:43.600
- than anywhere in the world.
- Young men are beaten

00:43.680 --> 00:45.080
and forced into the army,

00:45.160 --> 00:47.040
many as young as 12 years old.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.960
Beheadings and mutilations
are commonplace.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.120
The Karen people,

00:50.240 --> 00:51.560
comprised mostly
of poor Christian farmers,

00:51.680 --> 00:53.240
have been singled out for extermination.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.000
The ruling military government

00:55.120 --> 00:57.720
wants the abundant national resources
on Karen land.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.520
The bloody Burmese military campaign

00:59.640 --> 01:02.240
against the Karen people has been
going on for almost 60 years...

01:02.360 --> 01:04.720
the longest running civil war

01:04.800 --> 01:06.520
in the world.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.680
Hey! Hey!

06:08.800 --> 06:10.600
...number one.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.560
First snake that you see,

06:12.640 --> 06:14.360
they are Siamese cobra.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.080
Oh, come on, cobra.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.600
He is not king cobra

06:18.720 --> 06:20.200
and not spitting cobra.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.280
Hey! Hey!

06:37.040 --> 06:39.160
Fuck off, okay?

06:44.160 --> 06:47.120
...still have fang
and still have poison.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.360
He is small, dangerous...
Number one.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.520
King cobra number two.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.040
And now spitting cobra.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.960
He can spit poison to your eye.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.280
One color.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.560
He is very, very dangerous.
Number one in Thailand.

07:07.680 --> 07:10.120
Careful, my friend.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.760
Looks like dangerous work.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.160
I'm Michael Burnett.
Do you have some time to talk?

07:19.280 --> 07:21.200
Won't take long.
I promise.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.280
I was told it might be possible
to rent your boat.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.440
We'd like to do that.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.160
Is that possible?
We need to get upriver.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.680
Where you going?

07:27.760 --> 07:30.200
Into Burma.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.640
Burma's a war zone.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.960
Well, that's what people call it,

07:34.080 --> 07:36.920
but it's more like genocide than war.

07:37.240 --> 07:38.840
Anyway, this will be my fifth trip in,

07:38.920 --> 07:41.760
so we are aware of all the risks.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.280
I don't go that far north.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.320
Let me explain our situation.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.720
Our church is part of
a Pan-Asian ministry

07:50.840 --> 07:52.160
located in Colorado.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.760
We're all volunteers

07:53.880 --> 07:55.200
who, around this time of year,

07:55.520 --> 07:57.400
bring in medical supplies,

07:57.520 --> 07:59.000
medical attention,

07:59.080 --> 08:00.280
prayer books, and support

08:00.400 --> 08:02.800
for the Karen tribespeople.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.760
People say you know the river
better than anyone.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.640
- Well, they lied.
- So what I'm asking is

08:07.720 --> 08:08.920
that we compensate you

08:09.000 --> 08:11.480
for a few hours of your time

08:11.560 --> 08:13.400
that will help change people's lives.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.120
Are you bringing in any weapons?

08:18.240 --> 08:19.960
Of course not.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.960
You're not changing anything.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.800
Well...

08:25.920 --> 08:29.000
it's thinking like that that keeps
the world the way it is.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.680
Fuck the world.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.400
- Let's go.
- Why?

08:34.520 --> 08:36.640
He's not interested.
Let's just go.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.880
- Let me try.
- No, Sarah...

08:37.960 --> 08:39.600
Didn't you say it was
the only way up there?

08:39.679 --> 08:41.159
- I know I did.
- Then what do we have to lose?

08:41.280 --> 08:42.720
- I talked to the man...
- Just let me try, Michael.

08:42.840 --> 08:43.799
- Sarah...
- Please.

08:43.919 --> 08:44.880
You...

08:52.800 --> 08:53.920
Hello?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.040
I'm Sarah Miller.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.360
I hope you don't mind me
coming back here.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.880
The man that you
were talking to...

09:01.960 --> 09:03.320
I wasn't talking to anybody.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.400
All right, uh...

09:07.520 --> 09:09.360
the man that was talking
to you asked

09:09.440 --> 09:11.760
if we could hire you
to take us up the river.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.800
You said no. Why?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.680
Can't help you out.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.360
Well, if you have good reasons,

09:18.480 --> 09:20.560
would you mind if I heard them?

09:23.320 --> 09:25.720
Go home.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.920
Why'd you come back?

11:58.400 --> 11:59.320
Waiting for you.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.560
I told you before,
I can't help you.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.680
Well, we need to go
and help these people.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.240
We're here to make a difference.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.840
We believe all lives are special.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.160
- Some lives, some no.
- Really?

12:14.440 --> 12:16.000
If everyone thought like you,
nothing would ever change.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.280
- Nothing does change.
- Of course it does.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.400
Nothing stays the same.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.240
Live your life,
'cause you got a good one.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.720
It's what I'm trying to do.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.720
No, what you're trying
to do is change what is.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.280
And what is?

12:28.280 --> 12:29.240
Go home.

12:32.440 --> 12:33.920
Really. Go home.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.080
Maybe...

13:01.160 --> 13:04.360
maybe you've lost
your faith in people,

13:04.480 --> 13:07.320
but you must still
be faithful to something.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.560
You must still care
about something.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.280
Maybe we can't change what is...

13:14.400 --> 13:16.040
but trying to save a life

13:16.160 --> 13:18.240
isn't wasting your life.

13:18.360 --> 13:19.360
Is it?

13:42.440 --> 13:43.840
As bad as these people are,

13:43.920 --> 13:45.240
they will eventually lose.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.560
They can't keep it up
against a united front.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.480
They can't.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.640
I mean, time alone will tell,

13:50.720 --> 13:51.960
but in the meantime,

13:52.280 --> 13:53.680
we just have to help
hold it together.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.560
I mean, just the other day...

13:55.680 --> 13:56.680
Excuse me.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.680
Sarah, where are you going?

13:58.760 --> 14:00.320
To talk to him.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.840
Well, he... He probably
wants his privacy.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.640
Michael, we shouldn't ignore him.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.320
- He's helping us.
- He's been paid.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.920
He didn't take anything.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.720
Thank you again for doing this.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.760
Really.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.600
From all of us.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.520
You know you never
told us your name.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.600
John.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.400
Where you from?

14:27.520 --> 14:29.320
Bowie, Arizona.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.040
Why'd you leave?

14:31.160 --> 14:32.200
I got drafted in 'Nam.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.920
And you just stayed?

14:35.880 --> 14:37.080
It's complicated.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.800
You have family back home?

14:39.920 --> 14:42.080
Father maybe. I don't know.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.640
Aren't you curious to see

14:45.760 --> 14:47.480
how things might have
changed back home?

14:49.840 --> 14:51.680
Got to have a reason for that.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.120
Sarah.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.880
Because of you, we're going upriver.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.880
Anytime you want to turn around,

15:02.960 --> 15:04.120
it's done.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.320
Okay.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.040
What is it?
Who are they?

15:59.120 --> 16:00.760
Burmese pirates.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.640
Tell everyone to stay down,
don't make a sound.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.120
- Who are they?
- It's all right.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.520
- Just keep...
- Don't talk.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.360
- Any more of them?
- Maybe.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.000
What do you want to do?

16:48.120 --> 16:49.880
We should keep going.
We made a commitment.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.960
I ain't talking to you.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.760
- What do you want to do?
- We're a group here.

16:53.880 --> 16:54.920
If they wanna vote...

16:57.080 --> 16:58.200
Sit down!

16:58.320 --> 16:59.680
If it's money they want,
we'll give them what...

17:02.480 --> 17:04.480
Nobody talks.
Heads down.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.200
Keep your heads down,
and nobody look 'em in the eye,

17:15.319 --> 17:17.480
or they'll kill you.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.680
No!

19:09.360 --> 19:11.040
What did you do?

19:11.160 --> 19:13.240
We came here to help
stop the killing!

19:13.560 --> 19:14.680
Who are you to...

19:14.800 --> 19:16.440
- Who are you?
- Let him go!

19:16.520 --> 19:17.920
They would have
raped her 50 times

19:18.040 --> 19:20.880
and cut your fucking heads off.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.320
Who are you?

19:22.400 --> 19:23.840
Who are any of you?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.960
We're going back!

19:31.920 --> 19:32.880
No.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.160
No, we shouldn't go back.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.800
Let go.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.680
What are you doing?

19:38.800 --> 19:40.160
We are so close.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.320
What happened here,
it's horrible.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.920
But the people in there

19:45.000 --> 19:47.120
are being killed like this every day.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.960
Michael, this was your idea.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.520
We made a commitment.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.320
I know you don't believe
in what we're doing,

19:55.440 --> 19:58.360
but it's our life, our choice.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.200
You're not gonna change anything.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.480
Please.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.480
Please, John. Please.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.240
Go sit down.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.400
I'm sorry.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.720
We'll be taking
the overland route

21:20.800 --> 21:22.240
on the way back,

21:22.320 --> 21:24.120
so there's no need
to wait around.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.040
I have to report this.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.160
I know you think
what you did was right,

21:29.280 --> 21:31.120
but taking a life is never right.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.600
I don't know what to say.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.360
Then you shouldn't
say anything, should you?

21:52.480 --> 21:54.200
Good luck.

23:52.680 --> 23:53.640
Hey.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.520
Mm-hmm.
Good, good.

24:43.640 --> 24:44.560
Mm-hmm.

24:46.720 --> 24:47.960
Open.

24:51.840 --> 24:53.080
Yeah, good.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.240
With power, through the spirit

25:02.360 --> 25:03.720
in your inner being.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.360
So Christ may dwell
in your hearts with faith.

25:14.640 --> 25:18.520
And I pray...

25:18.600 --> 25:21.000
you may have power together...

25:22.920 --> 25:25.680
Let me see if I can fix
this little problem, okay?

25:27.560 --> 25:28.640
Okay.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.120
Hey, you.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.400
Hand me one of those bandages?

25:43.520 --> 25:45.760
Okay.

25:45.880 --> 25:46.960
Thank you.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.360
Okay.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.000
- Get out of here!
- What about them?

26:07.120 --> 26:08.280
Go on! Take them!

26:26.760 --> 26:27.720
No!

29:33.080 --> 29:36.000
Company leader calling Raven.
Come on, Raven.

29:37.560 --> 29:38.480
What am I?

29:38.600 --> 29:39.960
You made me this way.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.400
A full-blooded combat soldier.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.880
You just don't turn it off.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.280
Talk to me, Johnny.

29:44.360 --> 29:45.840
You just don't turn it off!

29:45.920 --> 29:47.520
- It's over!
- Nothing is over!

29:49.960 --> 29:52.480
When are you gonna
come full circle?

29:52.600 --> 29:54.320
- I know the reasons you're here, John.
- No!

29:55.440 --> 29:56.600
Aren't you curious to see

29:56.680 --> 29:57.720
how things might have
changed back home?

30:00.120 --> 30:02.040
You've done enough damage.

30:02.160 --> 30:04.120
You're always gonna be
tearing away at yourself

30:04.200 --> 30:06.000
until you come to terms
with what you are.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.320
Until you come full circle.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.240
So you're just gonna
stay here forever?

30:09.320 --> 30:12.560
- John!
- I wanna go home!

30:12.640 --> 30:14.800
John Rambo!

30:14.880 --> 30:16.920
John?

30:17.000 --> 30:18.520
John Rambo?

30:30.280 --> 30:32.000
My name is Arthur Marsh...

30:33.200 --> 30:36.440
pastor of the Christ Church
in Colorado.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.360
I need to talk with you.

30:38.480 --> 30:42.480
It's very important. I wouldn't
come here like this if it wasn't.

30:45.120 --> 30:47.600
The morning of the day
the group left,

30:47.880 --> 30:50.040
Michael Burnett notified me

30:50.160 --> 30:51.800
that they were traveling
from this location.

30:55.840 --> 30:56.760
What happened?

30:56.880 --> 30:58.720
No one knows exactly.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.760
They were supposed
to return 10 days ago,

31:00.880 --> 31:02.040
but they never came back.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.200
I requested help from the embassy,
but they can't help,

31:05.320 --> 31:08.440
not in Burma, and not in time.

31:08.520 --> 31:09.480
How do you know they're alive?

31:09.600 --> 31:11.000
Because we've been in contact

31:11.120 --> 31:12.560
with the Karen freedom fighters

31:12.880 --> 31:14.240
who say they think they know

31:14.360 --> 31:15.760
where they were taken.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.240
And I was given the name
of an ex-military

31:18.320 --> 31:20.160
American local from the embassy

31:20.240 --> 31:21.880
who put me in touch with men

31:21.960 --> 31:23.360
who say they have experience

31:23.440 --> 31:24.600
in this part of the world.

31:24.720 --> 31:25.880
Mercenaries.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.440
Yes.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.120
I don't have any other choice.

31:31.240 --> 31:33.400
You know the exact spot.

31:33.480 --> 31:36.320
We need you to take these men...

31:36.400 --> 31:37.400
to where you let our people off.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.400
When are they ready to leave?

31:39.680 --> 31:41.720
When you are.

31:59.120 --> 32:02.360
You know what you are?

32:02.480 --> 32:04.360
What you're made of?

32:07.280 --> 32:08.920
War is in your blood.

32:10.400 --> 32:11.800
Don't fight it.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.120
You didn't kill for your country.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.040
You killed for yourself.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.080
The gods are never
gonna make that go away.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.520
When you're pushed...

32:36.240 --> 32:38.720
killing's as easy as breathing.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.600
My head was mangled

32:43.680 --> 32:45.920
And my words were torn

32:46.040 --> 32:49.640
Covered in blood
like a newly born

32:50.920 --> 32:53.920
Hey, the wishing well

32:54.040 --> 32:56.480
Singin' soft and low

32:56.600 --> 32:58.360
I stayed for a while

32:58.440 --> 33:00.440
In the hollow sound

33:00.560 --> 33:01.880
The only water

33:02.200 --> 33:04.400
Came up from the ground

33:04.480 --> 33:07.360
- Look at this fucking place.
- Hey, the wishing well

33:07.440 --> 33:09.120
Only a fucking ape would live here.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.840
What the fuck am I doing here?

33:10.920 --> 33:13.720
Hey, knock that shit off.

33:13.800 --> 33:16.080
And you don't like the arts.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.120
And you don't like shit.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.760
I like your sister, Diaz.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.480
She got a thing for retards.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.480
Oi, boat man.

33:22.600 --> 33:25.160
How much longer
in this ancient piece of shit?

33:29.960 --> 33:31.960
So what'd the reverend
say to you?

33:32.080 --> 33:34.120
Some shit about
padre's flock going missing.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.280
I said to him, "Look, mate.

33:35.360 --> 33:36.320
"That's what you get when you go

33:36.440 --> 33:37.880
"trespassing into fucking Burma.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.480
"That's what you'll get when you go

33:39.600 --> 33:41.040
sniffing around other people's garbage."

33:41.120 --> 33:42.080
You know those generals in there

33:42.200 --> 33:43.440
are making millions cranking out meth

33:43.520 --> 33:44.760
more than any other place
on the fucking planet.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.960
- Bullshit.
- Millions, moron.

33:47.240 --> 33:48.800
How do you think
they pay for that shit?

33:48.920 --> 33:50.320
You ought to try reading
the paper, redneck,

33:50.400 --> 33:51.680
instead of sleeping under it.

33:51.800 --> 33:54.400
Fucking generals,
biggest junkies of all of them.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.440
- It's noble, Louis.
- You what?

33:56.560 --> 34:00.120
Those people going in there
with no weapons,

34:00.240 --> 34:03.000
just books and meds, it's noble.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.880
Oi, School Boy!

34:04.960 --> 34:06.160
You stick your noble nose
into other people's business,

34:06.440 --> 34:07.520
you get fucked up

34:07.640 --> 34:09.239
or you get dead.
The only reason

34:09.360 --> 34:10.800
I'm doing this is for an ex-wife

34:10.920 --> 34:12.679
and 3 kids, and after this shit is over,

34:12.800 --> 34:14.199
you can shove that
soldiering right up your ass.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.639
Try the decaf, mate.

34:15.960 --> 34:16.880
Fuck off! And you,

34:17.000 --> 34:18.199
I don't want to fucking die

34:18.320 --> 34:21.400
of old age before
I get there, so move.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.120
You say something?

34:36.320 --> 34:38.040
Sing it to yourself

34:38.120 --> 34:40.239
Sing it all night

34:40.320 --> 34:43.960
Spent a lot of time
in the garbage can

34:44.040 --> 34:47.639
Fighting over food
with the garbage man

34:47.760 --> 34:50.840
Hey, the wishing well

36:15.920 --> 36:18.320
I was digging a well

36:18.440 --> 36:20.640
With an old blood stain

36:20.760 --> 36:24.520
Poking around
with a blind man's...

36:24.640 --> 36:26.680
Is it me,

36:26.800 --> 36:27.960
or does the air this time of year

36:28.080 --> 36:30.200
smell like a goddamn wet dog?

36:32.160 --> 36:34.680
Fuck sake!
I could swim faster than this.

36:34.800 --> 36:35.960
Am I right?

36:36.040 --> 36:37.120
Heard that.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.480
Come on.
Chop, chop!

36:39.600 --> 36:41.880
The quicker we get there,
the quicker we get back.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.160
Lousy God-squadders.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.960
They come over here,

36:52.080 --> 36:54.240
spouting all that shit...

36:55.440 --> 36:56.680
and they expect the whole world

36:56.800 --> 36:57.800
to work like
their fucking neighborhood.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.600
Well, it doesn't...

37:00.720 --> 37:04.120
so they send in the devil...

37:04.200 --> 37:05.360
to do God's work.

37:05.440 --> 37:08.240
It's ironic, isn't it?

37:08.320 --> 37:11.200
Am I boring you, mate?

37:12.520 --> 37:14.560
Or is it... is it the trip?

37:14.680 --> 37:16.720
Has it got you nervous?

37:16.800 --> 37:18.320
'Cause really you should
appreciate the action,

37:18.400 --> 37:19.800
you know what I mean?

37:20.080 --> 37:22.680
Got to be better than looking
at the ass end of a snake.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.400
Oh, dear.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.400
You really are
an uptight bastard, aren't you?

37:32.320 --> 37:34.160
You can drop
the thousand-yard stare.

37:34.240 --> 37:36.440
I've seen it all before,

37:36.560 --> 37:38.360
and I'm not impressed.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.960
He's old-school SAS.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.040
They're first-rate soldiers,

37:54.120 --> 37:56.600
but total egomaniacs.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.000
They call me School Boy.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.400
The name stuck with me
since sniper school.

38:03.560 --> 38:04.880
And me mates won't
stop calling me it

38:04.960 --> 38:06.880
no matter how many people I shoot.

38:10.200 --> 38:14.120
It has illustrations
made by Tiny's hand

38:33.760 --> 38:35.680
What do you want from us?

39:21.720 --> 39:24.320
One man and a kid.
You gotta be fucking joking.

39:24.440 --> 39:27.160
- This all the rebels they put up?
- I'm not liking it.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.320
You're in a fucking jungle, puss nuts.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.240
There's nothing to like.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.520
How're you doing?

39:31.640 --> 39:32.840
My name is Myint.

39:32.960 --> 39:33.880
This is Tha.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.800
- Is this it?
- Yes.

39:35.880 --> 39:38.680
- What's up with the kid, man?
- He good tracker.

39:38.760 --> 39:41.120
We don't need a tracker,
we need a fucking guide.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.400
You know the exact
location, right?

39:43.520 --> 39:44.640
10 kilometers west,

39:44.760 --> 39:46.560
2 north, 6 to a walk.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.920
- How many soldiers?
- Hundred maybe.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.200
- Hundred?
- What'd he say?

39:50.280 --> 39:53.000
More new soldiers come tomorrow.

39:53.120 --> 39:55.240
Hey, I know I'm just
a white trash grunt, but I can count.

39:55.480 --> 39:56.960
Fuck fucking with a hundred strong.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.000
All right, all right,
all right, all right,

39:58.120 --> 39:59.400
let's get this straight.

39:59.520 --> 40:00.920
We don't engage anybody.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.200
If we can extract these people, good.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.680
But it's in-out clean, or we fuck off.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.480
Somebody wanna tell me
what the boat man's doing?

40:09.440 --> 40:11.200
Hey, why aren't you waiting
with the boat?

40:11.320 --> 40:13.400
My men are staying
with the boat.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.320
You're the boat man.
You stay with the boat.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.280
- I won't slow you down.
- Yeah, I know you won't.

40:17.560 --> 40:19.640
- It's not a fucking nature hike.
- Believe that.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.920
- He can hang with me at the back.
- Hey, hey, he stays here.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.520
He's the boat man.
He stays with the fucking boat.

40:24.640 --> 40:27.800
I want a white man on it,
not some fucking dink.

40:27.880 --> 40:29.240
Now who's got explosives? Tombstone?

40:29.360 --> 40:32.480
- None.
- A pound of C4 and primer.

40:32.600 --> 40:33.520
I got a claymore.

40:33.640 --> 40:37.120
All right, let's get on with it.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.360
Come on, move.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.680
What the fuck is that?

41:16.800 --> 41:18.600
Called Tallboy Bomb.

41:18.720 --> 41:21.880
English drop in World War II.

42:08.560 --> 42:11.400
Your people taken from here.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.640
Man, I have seen some shit.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.040
Brother, I ain't never
seen no shit like this.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.800
Word.

42:26.200 --> 42:27.960
Check it out.

42:33.200 --> 42:36.160
Armies come.
Kill everything.

42:36.280 --> 42:39.200
Leave our dead here as warning.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.600
He see enough.

42:45.720 --> 42:48.160
Mine everywhere.

42:48.280 --> 42:50.400
Watch where you walking.

43:04.520 --> 43:06.520
- All right, let's move on.
- To what?

43:06.640 --> 43:08.280
They even killed the fucking dogs.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.400
Those people are dead.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.480
I'm with En-Joo.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.360
We at least have to go
and have a look-see,

43:12.480 --> 43:13.400
check it out.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.200
I'm with you.
Let's check it out.

43:15.320 --> 43:16.280
Check what?
They're a hundred strong.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.480
Hey, we took the man's money.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.400
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.960
Just calm down. Calm down.

43:23.320 --> 43:24.240
We go there,

43:24.560 --> 43:26.000
and we see what's what.

43:26.080 --> 43:28.800
If anything's wrong, anything at all,

43:28.920 --> 43:30.480
we leave.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.280
All right?

43:33.400 --> 43:34.320
Yeah.

43:35.760 --> 43:36.720
All right.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.280
Good.

43:38.400 --> 43:39.320
Which way?

43:39.440 --> 43:40.880
This way.

43:44.200 --> 43:46.040
Army! Go! Go!

44:08.440 --> 44:09.720
I'm going to fire on them.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.240
- No!
- If they don't make it back

44:11.520 --> 44:12.640
from wherever
the hell they came from,

44:12.760 --> 44:13.880
man, they are on to us.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.680
What the fuck
are they doing, man?

46:00.480 --> 46:01.440
Who are you, boat man?

46:01.560 --> 46:02.840
Let's move.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.680
Move? They're going to come
hunting our asses down

46:04.800 --> 46:06.160
when these guys don't show up.

46:06.240 --> 46:08.120
We don't need this shit.
We're going back to the boat.

46:08.200 --> 46:09.160
Let's go.

46:09.280 --> 46:10.760
- Whoa!
- Hey, hey!

46:15.960 --> 46:19.040
Any of you boys want to shoot,

46:19.160 --> 46:20.280
now's the time.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.400
And there isn't one of us

46:27.520 --> 46:30.640
that doesn't want
to be someplace else.

46:30.720 --> 46:34.880
But this is what we do, who we are.

46:37.120 --> 46:40.120
Live for nothing

46:40.240 --> 46:43.360
or die for something.

46:45.680 --> 46:47.560
Your call.

46:49.480 --> 46:51.080
What's your call?

46:51.200 --> 46:52.360
Let's move.

47:35.520 --> 47:38.160
Once School Boy's on the tower,
we got 15 minutes.

47:38.240 --> 47:39.960
Set your watches to 1:45.

47:40.080 --> 47:42.080
In, out, no waiting around
for nobody.

47:42.200 --> 47:43.680
We meet at the base
of the tower.

47:43.800 --> 47:45.080
You don't make it
up there, we're fucked.

47:45.200 --> 47:47.640
He will, inbred. All set?

47:47.760 --> 47:49.200
- Yeah.
- Set.

48:50.400 --> 48:51.320
We're in.

48:59.800 --> 49:00.720
Go.

49:03.240 --> 49:04.200
Go.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.440
Go.

49:19.920 --> 49:21.560
Go!

50:49.920 --> 50:51.160
Shit!

50:52.440 --> 50:54.600
Don't talk.
We're getting you out.

50:54.720 --> 50:55.880
Where's the girl?

50:56.000 --> 50:56.920
She's over there.

50:57.240 --> 50:58.160
You untie him.

50:58.280 --> 50:59.440
We'll be back for you.

51:23.880 --> 51:25.120
You.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.840
There's two of them
in the cage near the pigs.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.400
- Get 'em.
- Got it.

51:32.480 --> 51:35.320
Hey!

52:45.800 --> 52:47.160
Shh!

53:57.120 --> 53:58.040
Come on. Come on.

53:58.160 --> 53:59.120
Do you have Sarah?

53:59.200 --> 54:00.360
Shut up. Come on.

55:54.040 --> 55:55.520
- Let's move!
- Where's the boat man?

55:55.640 --> 55:57.360
- And Sarah.
- 15 minutes. That's the deal.

55:57.440 --> 55:58.440
- We're leaving.
- Let's go!

55:58.560 --> 55:59.960
- Five more minutes.
- Bullshit!

56:00.040 --> 56:01.240
He knew the deal.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.600
We came together,
we fucking leave together!

56:02.720 --> 56:03.800
Your life. Let's go.

56:03.880 --> 56:05.080
Not without her!

56:08.440 --> 56:10.400
God didn't save your life.
We did.

56:10.520 --> 56:11.800
Now fucking get up.

56:13.080 --> 56:14.560
Get up. Move!

56:14.680 --> 56:16.080
This way.

58:53.360 --> 58:54.520
- Got a compass?
- Yeah.

58:54.640 --> 58:56.240
Why did you come back?

58:56.320 --> 58:57.960
Why did you?

58:59.840 --> 59:00.800
Hang on till daylight.

59:00.920 --> 59:01.960
This way.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.440
My leg! My leg!
Jesus! God damn it!

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.600
Shut up. Shut up.
We got you. We're getting out.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.160
- His leg is shredded!
- Shit.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.240
Where's the guide?

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.000
The son of a bitch is gone!

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.160
Fuck him. I know the coordinates.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.360
We're not making it
to the river with him.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.720
Would you shut the fuck up?

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.840
Tie his leg. Take off his boot.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.280
No!

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.840
Leave his boot on.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.240
Let us in here.
We're doctors. I need a knife.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.680
Here, here, here.

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.120
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.360
- He going to make it?
- I don't know. Make a stretcher.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.680
Spread out!

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.800
Take the point!

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.960
Take it! Take it!

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.520
Hear that?

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.000
They're tracking us.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.640
- Turn around.
- What are you doing?

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.000
Just move. Turn, turn.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.920
All right.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.720
I want you two to head
southeast to the river.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.080
And the boat will be waiting.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.240
If it's not there,
you can follow the shoreline

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.600
until I find you.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.520
What about you?

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.520
I'll be all right.
Give me that claymore.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.320
- Now fire off a shot.
- What?

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.880
Fire off a shot!

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.440
Go! Go!

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.720
Come on! Come on!

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.280
- Let's move it!
- Let's go!

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.000
I got you, I got you.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.680
Let's move.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.840
Down, down.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.000
Wait. What is it?

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.600
What? What?

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.720
Ah, son of a bitch. Look.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.800
What is it?

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.480
Oh, God.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.120
God damn.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.840
You gutless fuck!

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:51.160
You fucking pussy!

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.600
Gutless fuck!

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.040
Come and have a go at me,
you lady-boy cunt!

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.440
Come on, you...
Fucking have a go at me!

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.160
Fuck... You fucking...
Do something...

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.320
Fucking Jesus!

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.760
What did we do? Nothing!

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.680
Jesus... Aah!

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.480
Oh, God.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.480
What will we do?

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.200
Nothing we can do.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:51.480
The Khan rebels!

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.280
Oh! Fuck!

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.040
Michael.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.200
Michael!

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.520
Michael.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.360
Michael.

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.240
Michael?

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.520
Michael?

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.080
Michael?

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.720
Michael!

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.560
Michael!

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.360
Michael!

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:22.840
Michael.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.320
Oh, my God!

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.240
It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.440
Go help them, okay?

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.080
All right.
