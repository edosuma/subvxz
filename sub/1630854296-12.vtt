WEBVTT

00:08.540 --> 00:10.920
All right, Three Rock,
tell me what you see.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.330
I see fuel.

00:12.530 --> 00:14.260
It's a south-facing slope;
that means it's dry.

00:14.460 --> 00:15.760
MANNY: And
you, Rohan?

00:15.960 --> 00:17.530
There's snow on the ground,
so no fire danger.

00:17.730 --> 00:19.030
Not true, Rohan. Given
the right wind conditions,

00:19.230 --> 00:21.400
this hillside's a wildfire
waiting to happen.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.300
Cap, you ruin nature hikes
for us.

00:23.500 --> 00:24.640
Not a nature hike, Bode,
it's a training hike,

00:24.840 --> 00:25.900
and I need you
to see all the risks.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.440
That way,
you can be prepared for 'em.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.040
FREDDY: Tell you
what I don't see.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.840
Access roads for
easy evacuation.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.180
That's my boy Freddy-- always
looking for an escape route.

00:33.380 --> 00:34.550
(fake laughs)

00:34.750 --> 00:36.420
Go ahead and laugh,
but Cap taught me--

00:36.620 --> 00:39.020
you walk into a fire,
you better have a way out.

00:39.220 --> 00:40.850
MANNY:
Couldn't have said it
better myself, Goat.

00:41.050 --> 00:42.260
(Freddy chuckles)

00:42.460 --> 00:43.190
(airplane whirring)
MANNY:
All right, guys,

00:43.390 --> 00:44.220
let's take five.

00:44.420 --> 00:45.820
"Marry me"?

00:46.020 --> 00:48.260
Excuse me?
FREDDY: (laughs)
I like you, sir,

00:48.460 --> 00:51.450
but I'm talking about the plane.

00:52.850 --> 00:54.700
S...

00:54.900 --> 00:56.890
Sam? Sarah?

00:58.690 --> 01:00.640
What if Sam or Sarah
doesn't want to get married?

01:00.840 --> 01:03.210
Oh, that's your problem
with Cap's daughter, you know.

01:03.410 --> 01:05.140
Fear of rejection.

01:05.340 --> 01:08.210
I got bigger things on my mind
right now, Freddy.
Gah, gah,

01:08.410 --> 01:10.830
gah, gah. Nothing bigger
than love, brother.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.920
Gabriela doesn't want
to have anything to do with me.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.570
'Cause you almost beat up
that guy last week?

01:18.370 --> 01:19.960
Yeah.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.990
It freaked her out.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.360
So, apologize.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.070
Tell her you're changing.

01:26.270 --> 01:28.700
Flutter those big baby blues.

01:28.900 --> 01:31.090
What if she's right, though?

01:32.590 --> 01:34.690
You know, she's probably
better off without me.

01:35.860 --> 01:37.810
You run into fires
like a superhero,

01:38.010 --> 01:39.580
but you're gonna run away
from this?

01:39.780 --> 01:42.600
(plane whirring loudly)

01:43.630 --> 01:46.490
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
what the hell?! Hey! Hey!

01:46.690 --> 01:49.320
(indistinct,
overlapping shouting)

01:49.520 --> 01:50.960
Green Crest, Three Rock Crew
Four. We got a new incident.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.140
BODE: Whoa, I hope
he has a parachute.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.710
MANNY:
Come on, guys.
Let's go find that plane.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.570
Wow, Collin. You've had a lot
of jobs over the years.

02:02.770 --> 02:06.410
Yeah. Uh, um, I spent most
of my twenties rebelling

02:06.610 --> 02:08.170
against expectations.

02:08.370 --> 02:09.580
Uh, my dad worked for Cal Fire,

02:09.780 --> 02:11.810
so, kind of grew up
in his shadow.

02:12.010 --> 02:14.010
Oh, I met your dad
a couple times.

02:14.210 --> 02:16.050
Solid as they come.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.120
That's what I'm told.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.590
All right, come on.
Let me show you around.

02:20.790 --> 02:23.590
My son, Bode, he...

02:23.790 --> 02:26.460
he resisted the calling
for a long time, too,

02:26.660 --> 02:28.290
but he's a natural.

02:28.490 --> 02:30.030
It's in his blood.

02:30.230 --> 02:31.360
Does he work here, too?

02:31.560 --> 02:34.030
No. He works across town
at Three Rock.

02:34.230 --> 02:36.070
Three Rock?

02:36.270 --> 02:38.340
Wait, isn't that a...
a prison firefighting camp?

02:38.540 --> 02:39.970
Yeah.

02:40.170 --> 02:41.310
Is he a captain?

02:41.510 --> 02:43.310
No, he's an inmate.

02:43.510 --> 02:45.080
BODE:
<i>Hey!</i>

02:45.280 --> 02:46.860
I see the pilot!

02:48.630 --> 02:51.180
MANNY:
Medevac's on the way, sir.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.890
Were there any more passengers?

02:53.090 --> 02:55.020
(groaning)
MANNY:
Easy!

02:55.220 --> 02:57.360
Try and
stay still.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.760
No. Just me. (groans)

02:59.960 --> 03:01.290
MANNY: All right,
we're gonna get you down.

03:01.490 --> 03:03.300
I need you to establish
a position above

03:03.500 --> 03:05.230
so we can lower him down,
all right?

03:05.430 --> 03:08.800
Hey, Cap, I-I can free-climb it.
Nah, Rohan's a doctor.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.870
He needs to be able to check his
vitals before we bring him down.

03:11.070 --> 03:12.570
You and Freddy head down
the ridge and

03:12.770 --> 03:14.040
see if you can spot
the wreckage, all right? Go.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.070
Copy that, Cap.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.740
(indistinct chatter)

03:18.940 --> 03:21.010
Did you know that
Rohan was a doctor?

03:21.210 --> 03:23.020
I thought he was in
for dealing drugs.

03:23.220 --> 03:26.540
Oh. He was dealing <i>drugs.</i>

03:29.370 --> 03:31.890
Hey, Shar. What--

03:32.090 --> 03:33.890
What-what are
you doing here?

03:34.090 --> 03:37.760
Well, actually,
it's Division Chief Leone.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.300
Oh. Somebody got cleared
to come back to work.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.670
Yeah. (laughs)

03:42.870 --> 03:44.670
The dialysis is working.

03:44.870 --> 03:47.070
And once she gets her new
kidney, she'll be unstoppable.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.110
Oh, when are you getting
the transplant?

03:49.310 --> 03:51.380
Okay. I don't want to talk
about my kidneys anymore,

03:51.580 --> 03:52.610
except to say "thank you."

03:52.810 --> 03:54.150
I know most of
you gave blood

03:54.350 --> 03:57.780
to see if you were compatible
to donate, and I don't want

03:57.980 --> 04:01.020
to know if you're a match...
yet.

04:01.220 --> 04:03.490
Uh, that way, if I see
you eating junk food

04:03.690 --> 04:04.760
and possibly
destroying

04:04.960 --> 04:08.180
my kidney, I won't be mad.

04:10.950 --> 04:12.400
Well, I'm not a match, so...

04:12.600 --> 04:15.200
Oh! I don't want to know.
(laughter)

04:15.400 --> 04:16.470
Thank you.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.800
Please resume
eating your donut.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.610
Vince, you gonna introduce
me to your new probie?

04:21.810 --> 04:24.040
Uh, oh. Um...

04:24.240 --> 04:26.210
I... Uh, yeah. Hi.

04:26.410 --> 04:27.550
Nice to meet you all.

04:27.750 --> 04:30.120
Uh, my name's Collin O'Reilly.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.080
SHARON:
Any relation

04:32.280 --> 04:33.690
to Kirk O'Reilly?

04:33.890 --> 04:35.890
GABRIELA:
<i>Who's Kirk O'Reilly?</i>

04:36.090 --> 04:39.730
Well, he's dead now,
but Cal Fire legend.

04:39.930 --> 04:41.360
I mean, real badass.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.500
Which makes Collin a nugget.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.860
What's a nugget?

04:45.060 --> 04:46.530
You know
what a nugget is.

04:46.730 --> 04:48.100
No, I don't.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.600
You're a nugget, 'cause
your dad is head of Three Rock.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.040
EVE:
And anyone's parent

04:52.240 --> 04:55.640
who's a part of Cal Fire
is a nugget.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.580
This is how you talk about us?

04:57.780 --> 05:01.250
I mean, not to
your face, but, yeah.

05:01.450 --> 05:03.320
(laughter)
Thanks.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.550
(tires squealing)

05:04.750 --> 05:06.420
I'm having a baby.

05:06.620 --> 05:08.420
Um... now?
(whimpering)

05:08.620 --> 05:10.590
I'm not from here.

05:10.790 --> 05:13.690
Um, contractions started
about 100 miles ago,

05:13.890 --> 05:15.190
and my water broke

05:15.390 --> 05:17.160
about ten miles ago,
and now I feel like...

05:17.360 --> 05:18.860
I feel like I have to push.
Okay, listen.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.870
We can get you to
the hospital, okay?
Okay.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.240
Can you move?
Here comes another contraction.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.740
(groaning, panting)

05:24.940 --> 05:27.010
WOMAN:
This baby's coming now.

05:27.210 --> 05:28.770
There's no time
for the hospital.

05:28.970 --> 05:30.280
Please tell me I can do this

05:30.480 --> 05:32.140
because I'm scared to death.
Just breathe.

05:32.340 --> 05:34.310
And, oh, here it comes.
All right, breathe.

05:34.510 --> 05:36.680
Breathe.
JAKE:
Vince, Sharon,

05:36.880 --> 05:38.080
we need you
in the bay!

05:38.280 --> 05:39.450
Oh.

05:39.650 --> 05:40.790
All right, guys,
glove up.

05:40.990 --> 05:42.790
She's right. There's
no time for the hospital.

05:42.990 --> 05:44.060
(crying, groaning)

05:44.260 --> 05:46.660
MANNY:
Keep going. Slowly.

05:46.860 --> 05:50.760
Slowly. Slowly.
Good, good, good.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.570
Easy! Easy! That's it.

05:53.770 --> 05:54.730
SHARON:
That's it.

05:54.930 --> 05:57.540
(woman crying, yelling)

05:57.740 --> 06:00.740
That's it. Chin up.
That's good.

06:00.940 --> 06:03.940
Here it comes!
Here it comes!
(cries out)

06:04.140 --> 06:07.650
(baby crying)
Oh. Oh. Oh.

06:07.850 --> 06:10.650
(laughing)

06:10.850 --> 06:13.100
Oh, good job, Mama. (laughs)

06:14.440 --> 06:16.220
(laughing):
Oh.

06:16.420 --> 06:18.620
Oh, very good. Oh!

06:18.820 --> 06:21.190
Is there someone that
we can call for you?

06:21.390 --> 06:23.460
Yeah, call my boyfriend.

06:23.660 --> 06:26.370
He's an inmate at Three Rock.

06:26.570 --> 06:29.380
Okay.
(baby crying)

06:31.390 --> 06:32.920
Oh, man.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.660
(glass shattering)

06:52.410 --> 06:54.440
* *

07:06.460 --> 07:08.310
Air tac's reporting 400 acres,
rapid rate of spread,

07:08.510 --> 07:09.540
moving up the hill.

07:09.740 --> 07:11.080
I'm gonna evacuate
the whole area,

07:11.280 --> 07:12.480
before it
gets bad.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.280
Ah, it shouldn't be too tough.
It's pretty rural.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.320
I've already established
Alpha here, and then,

07:17.520 --> 07:20.550
Bravo, Charlie
here and here.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.250
Three Rock is
cutting line there.

07:22.450 --> 07:23.820
It's too steep for a dozer.
I need your guys

07:24.020 --> 07:26.430
to go in and support them
with a hose lay, and then

07:26.630 --> 07:27.930
put a lookout
for spot fires.

07:28.130 --> 07:31.200
We're gonna box the whole
thing in on all sides.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.800
Welcome back to work.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.400
Deliver a baby,
fight a wildfire.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.640
And look good doing it.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.450
(laughing)

07:40.320 --> 07:42.370
Manny, pin me
your exact location.

07:42.580 --> 07:44.380
I got to come talk to Freddy.

07:44.580 --> 07:46.800
(indistinct chatter)

07:51.400 --> 07:52.920
Good work, Three Rock!

07:53.120 --> 07:55.950
Where's Freddy? Freddy,

07:56.150 --> 07:57.320
where are you?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.410
Here, ma'am.
Coming.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.360
(panting)
You all right, ma'am?

08:01.560 --> 08:02.900
Yes. We're not here
to talk about me.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.700
Whatever you heard,

08:04.900 --> 08:07.200
I didn't do it,
and neither did Bode.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.670
I'm glad to hear that,

08:08.870 --> 08:10.470
'cause I heard you got
your girlfriend pregnant

08:10.670 --> 08:12.840
in the boom-boom room
in Lancaster eight months ago.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.040
Oh, yeah, I did
do that. (laughs)

08:15.240 --> 08:17.680
Wait. How would
you know?

08:17.880 --> 08:20.010
I just helped deliver your baby.

08:20.210 --> 08:21.850
What?
Yeah.

08:22.050 --> 08:23.880
Cookie drove up here
for visiting day tomorrow,

08:24.080 --> 08:27.250
and she went into labor halfway
between L.A. and Edgewater.

08:27.450 --> 08:29.920
No. No, no, no.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.560
They wouldn't send the chief
if everything was okay.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.160
There's something wrong
with my baby.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.890
What's wrong with my baby?!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

08:35.090 --> 08:37.300
You have a perfectly
healthy little pudge.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.030
(exhales)
(laughing)

08:40.230 --> 08:41.530
Boy or girl?

08:41.730 --> 08:43.240
I'm gonna let Cookie
tell you that.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.090
(touch tones sounding)
You call.

08:47.490 --> 08:49.340
Thank you.
(laughing)

08:49.540 --> 08:52.230
Hose connected.
Gonna lay it down.

08:53.060 --> 08:54.110
MANNY (over radio):
Three Rock's on the ridge

08:54.310 --> 08:55.760
clearing brush.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.320
Excuse me, sir.

09:01.520 --> 09:02.920
Hate to tell you this,

09:03.120 --> 09:05.740
but we're evacuating
the hillside.

09:06.710 --> 09:08.460
Fire won't make it up here.

09:08.660 --> 09:10.300
It very well could.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.200
It won't.

09:12.400 --> 09:16.600
I've been here 43 years, been
evacuated six or eight times.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.390
It hasn't burned down yet.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.980
Chief Leone. Vince.

09:23.180 --> 09:24.710
Hey, Chief. Harlan Denbo.

09:24.910 --> 09:27.150
Well, Harlan, we're just
up here doing our job.

09:27.350 --> 09:28.950
Sure would make it easier

09:29.150 --> 09:30.620
if you'd just comply
with the evacuation.

09:30.820 --> 09:34.470
How about doing your job
by helping me defend my house?

09:36.070 --> 09:38.860
Our main priority
is to protect lives.

09:39.060 --> 09:40.930
Is there anybody
else in the house

09:41.130 --> 09:43.600
who might want to
make it to safety?

09:43.800 --> 09:45.630
Wife? Kids? Grandkids?

09:45.830 --> 09:47.770
Just me.

09:47.970 --> 09:51.570
Do you have someplace to go
if the fire does get here?

09:51.770 --> 09:53.960
I'll leave
when I see flames.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.150
(clears throat)

10:00.350 --> 10:02.110
He doesn't see flames.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.450
Fire's not real to him yet.

10:04.650 --> 10:06.990
Well, I guess we got
to make it real for him.

10:07.190 --> 10:11.010
Yeah. Let's go ahead
and try dental records, I guess.

10:13.010 --> 10:15.090
Which one of you
feels scariest today?

10:15.290 --> 10:17.460
Me.
Me.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.580
Yeah, both of you, go.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.980
Hi. We were,
uh, hoping

10:30.180 --> 10:32.380
to come in and talk
to you for a minute?
You can't come in,

10:32.580 --> 10:34.080
but go ahead and talk.
I'm on hold.
Well, we were

10:34.280 --> 10:36.680
wondering if you have any copies
of your dental records.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.120
EVE:
In case things get
out of hand and we have

10:38.320 --> 10:40.120
to identify your body.
You know, you could be

10:40.320 --> 10:41.650
making sure
that the fire gets put out.

10:41.850 --> 10:42.890
Take your big old hoses

10:43.090 --> 10:44.390
and blast that thing
down to nothing.

10:44.590 --> 10:45.620
Instead, you're up
here wasting time

10:45.820 --> 10:47.160
trying to scare
an old man?

10:47.360 --> 10:48.560
MAN (on phone):
How do you spell your name?

10:48.760 --> 10:50.100
Sir, we...
Denbo.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.960
D-E-N-B-O.
Okay, let me put you
on a brief hold.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.600
No. No, damn it,
don't put me on hold again.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.030
It will be very brief,
I promise.

10:56.230 --> 10:57.800
(easy listening music plays
over phone)

10:58.000 --> 11:01.340
Dr. Carter at Edgewater Dental
will have 'em.

11:01.540 --> 11:03.180
And do me a favor.
Since I'll be dead,

11:03.380 --> 11:05.890
thank her for all the
excellent work over the years.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.180
I don't think
we scared him.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.570
(indistinct chatter)

11:15.900 --> 11:17.690
Hey. Cookie had
a baby for real?

11:17.890 --> 11:19.490
As real as they come.

11:19.690 --> 11:21.790
(laughs)
So you're just--
you're back to work now?

11:21.990 --> 11:23.600
Yeah, and I'm feeling
really good

11:23.800 --> 11:26.230
except for this fire
tearing up the mountainside.

11:26.430 --> 11:28.680
I got to go down.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.520
Mom?

11:34.320 --> 11:35.990
I'm a match.

11:37.190 --> 11:40.050
I-I'm a match
to donate my kidney.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.050
I just found out.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.650
You got tested?
They let you give blood?

11:44.850 --> 11:47.720
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
I still got a bunch of tests

11:47.920 --> 11:49.350
and hoops
to jump through, but...

11:49.550 --> 11:51.190
That's a really risky surgery.

11:51.390 --> 11:52.790
I don't care.

11:52.990 --> 11:55.810
No! No, you have to care!

11:57.650 --> 11:58.560
You know,

11:58.760 --> 11:59.630
I held that little baby today,

11:59.830 --> 12:01.170
and I remembered holding you

12:01.370 --> 12:02.770
and wanting to keep you safe.

12:02.970 --> 12:04.970
That was my job.
That was my whole job.

12:05.170 --> 12:07.270
And I haven't done it
very well, but, no,

12:07.470 --> 12:08.640
I'm not doing this.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.030
I am not taking your kidney.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.220
GABRIELA:
Do you know what
"spinning the weather" means?

12:17.420 --> 12:19.750
COLLIN:
Spinning the weather.
No. No, I have no idea.

12:19.950 --> 12:22.450
But I'm gonna guess it
involves spinning and weather.

12:22.650 --> 12:24.190
MANNY: Gentlemen,
watch your footing!

12:24.390 --> 12:26.790
Have each other's back
and keep your head on a swivel.

12:26.990 --> 12:30.360
All the tools in this kit
will give us an accurate reading

12:30.560 --> 12:34.000
on, uh, temperature,
dew point,

12:34.200 --> 12:36.670
humidity, wind speed,
wind directions.

12:36.870 --> 12:39.100
We have a wet bulb
and dry bulb.
Oh.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.570
We're gonna wet it.
Uh-huh. This one.

12:41.770 --> 12:44.680
And... spin it.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.080
(saw buzzing in distance)

12:47.280 --> 12:49.760
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.990
So how long you
been with Cal Fire?

12:53.190 --> 12:54.190
Couple months.

12:54.390 --> 12:56.290
What? That's it?

12:56.490 --> 12:58.460
Thought you'd been here
for, like, years.

12:58.660 --> 13:00.460
You'll get there.

13:00.660 --> 13:02.360
Spin it parallel to the ground.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.960
Oh.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.820
Mm-hmm.

13:10.650 --> 13:11.840
Hey, which one's
the chief's kid?

13:12.040 --> 13:13.570
The one with
the chainsaw.

13:13.770 --> 13:15.670
COLLIN: What'd he do
to get locked up?

13:15.870 --> 13:18.280
Does it matter?
No.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.010
No. I'm sorry.

13:20.210 --> 13:22.110
You're right. It's
none of my business.

13:22.310 --> 13:24.150
My dad was an inmate.

13:24.350 --> 13:26.350
And now he's captain
of Three Rock.

13:26.550 --> 13:27.650
People can change.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.890
Wait. That guy's your dad?

13:30.090 --> 13:32.360
Mm-hmm.
Oh, so you're a
nugget, too, huh?

13:32.560 --> 13:33.560
Collin, don't step
on that rock.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.780
Seriously, don't!
Oh, no.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.430
Run!

13:39.630 --> 13:40.870
MANNY:
Heads up!

13:41.070 --> 13:42.720
Rock!

13:43.620 --> 13:45.850
Rock! Freddy!

13:54.730 --> 13:56.050
We have to tell him.
You're gonna get in trouble.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.050
I am the most senior
firefighter here,

13:57.250 --> 13:58.650
okay?
But it was me.

13:58.850 --> 14:00.350
Collin, everyone's waiting to
see what kind of nugget you are.

14:00.550 --> 14:02.250
So just shut up and
let me do the talking.
Perez.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.660
What the hell
happened up here?

14:04.860 --> 14:07.240
I'm so sorry, Chief.
I thought it was stable.

14:08.110 --> 14:09.590
It was you?

14:09.790 --> 14:11.510
Yes, sir.

14:12.550 --> 14:14.400
Well, I shouldn't have
to remind you

14:14.600 --> 14:16.070
there's lives on the line
down below.

14:16.270 --> 14:18.340
Understood.
It won't happen again.

14:18.540 --> 14:20.420
Yeah, it better not.

14:22.490 --> 14:25.560
(exhales)
Thanks for covering.

14:27.230 --> 14:28.450
MANNY:
Chief.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.480
You put two inexperienced people
at the look-out?

14:30.680 --> 14:32.550
Yes, I did. Falling rocks
are part of the job,

14:32.750 --> 14:35.090
so maybe you should train
your guys to look out for 'em.

14:35.290 --> 14:36.420
Stop it. No one died.

14:36.620 --> 14:37.720
Although
someone might

14:37.920 --> 14:39.660
if we don't get Mr. Denbo
off the mountain.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.990
He's not going anywhere
till he sees flames.

14:42.190 --> 14:43.530
Did you at least
try dental records?

14:43.730 --> 14:46.430
Yes, I tried dental records.
Look, that's an old song.

14:46.630 --> 14:47.800
Everybody up here knows it.
SHARON:
Okay.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.230
Well, since he knows the
risk, what do you think?

14:49.430 --> 14:51.170
Do we leave
him up there?

14:51.370 --> 14:52.500
I don't like leaving him
up there, no.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.240
Okay. Then have your guys
prep the house.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.010
My guys can prep faster
than your guys.

14:56.210 --> 14:58.040
Have you seen my guys work?
I have,

14:58.240 --> 15:00.010
and I take my crew
over your crew anytime.
Manny! Vince!

15:00.210 --> 15:02.150
You are on the same team.

15:02.350 --> 15:05.550
And I am gonna pull Manny's guys
off the hillside

15:05.750 --> 15:09.870
to do a retardant drop, so
you can work together, nicely.

15:10.870 --> 15:12.870
Yes, ma'am.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.830
(garbled radio transmission)

15:16.030 --> 15:18.480
What is up with him?

15:19.250 --> 15:21.500
I don't know.
One of his guys almost died,

15:21.700 --> 15:23.500
and his daughter would
have been responsible,

15:23.700 --> 15:26.240
and he lost his house
due to a gambling addiction?

15:26.440 --> 15:27.840
Not having a good week.

15:28.040 --> 15:30.340
Well, my son almost died,
my wife's got a bum kidney,

15:30.540 --> 15:32.610
but I think I'm handling
it like a champ.

15:32.810 --> 15:35.110
Bode matched.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.650
He tested?

15:36.850 --> 15:38.450
And he's a match.

15:38.650 --> 15:39.920
Well, great--
Okay, that's great.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.420
That's awesome, right?
No, I'm not taking it.

15:42.620 --> 15:44.520
You what? Sharon. (groans)
I'm not letting my kid

15:44.720 --> 15:46.190
who is finally
getting his life together

15:46.390 --> 15:47.530
put himself
in harm's way for me.

15:47.730 --> 15:49.230
EVE:
Chief?
I'm not.

15:49.430 --> 15:51.430
The hose lay is in.
What's the next assignment?

15:51.630 --> 15:53.170
We're going to
secure Denbo's house.

15:53.370 --> 15:56.300
Yes, sir. Let's go!

15:56.500 --> 15:57.440
We are gonna talk about this.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.140
Yes, we will.
Don't die up there.

15:59.340 --> 16:01.520
I don't die. Neither do you.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.140
MANNY:
<i>All right, Three Rock.</i>

16:04.340 --> 16:05.540
Tell me what you see.

16:05.740 --> 16:08.580
FREDDY: Smoke...
going in my lungs,

16:08.780 --> 16:11.650
killing me, and leaving
my baby without a daddy.

16:11.850 --> 16:14.450
Well, put your shroud
over your face, Freddy.

16:14.650 --> 16:16.150
I don't see
an escape route.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.290
Again: dead daddy.

16:18.490 --> 16:20.060
I'm not gonna
let you die, Freddy.

16:20.260 --> 16:23.980
Got your escape routes
already covered, all right?

16:24.750 --> 16:27.200
Hey, why didn't you
tell me about Cookie?

16:27.400 --> 16:29.430
I didn't want to jinx things.

16:29.630 --> 16:32.200
I'm really happy for you, man.
Thanks, bro.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.010
I am, too. Cookie's my rock.

16:35.210 --> 16:36.840
She's getting me through this.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.380
I'm telling you,
you need a little of what I got.

16:39.580 --> 16:41.710
I need a kid?
No.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.520
You need a stable
relationship.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.250
I have a stable
relationship.

16:45.450 --> 16:47.320
I have you, man.
No.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.220
I'm a family man now.

16:49.420 --> 16:51.220
Can't hang
with the boys.

16:51.420 --> 16:52.560
MANNY: All right,
hustle up, guys.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.710
We're going to
Harlan Denbo's house.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.750
(indistinct radio chatter)

17:01.280 --> 17:03.170
I told you.
I'm not leaving.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.600
We're here to help you
prep your house.
But if the wind starts

17:05.800 --> 17:08.540
to shift, and we get spot fires,
we're heading out.

17:08.740 --> 17:11.310
hope you'll come with us.

17:11.510 --> 17:13.650
All right, set up
for structure protection.

17:13.850 --> 17:15.180
All right, gentlemen,
safety zone's just

17:15.380 --> 17:16.680
on the other side
of that ridge.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.220
There's a dirt patch and
an access road. You got it?

17:18.420 --> 17:19.520
CREW MEMBERS: Yes, sir.
Freddy?

17:19.720 --> 17:21.420
Over the ridge, access road.
No dead daddies.

17:21.620 --> 17:23.020
That's right, baby.
All right, boys.

17:23.220 --> 17:25.920
Let's cut a highway
around this house, fellas.

17:26.120 --> 17:28.560
EVE:
<i>So, I overhead Sharon</i>
<i>and Vince talking.</i>

17:28.760 --> 17:30.230
I think Bode's a match.

17:30.430 --> 17:31.700
JAKE: Well,
you didn't match.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.430
Were you relieved
or disappointed?

17:34.630 --> 17:36.130
Little bit of both.
You tested, right?

17:36.330 --> 17:38.140
Yeah. I didn't match.

17:38.340 --> 17:40.770
Thank God.
Well, why "Thank God"?

17:40.970 --> 17:43.710
You saving Sharon's life?
That makes you the hero.

17:43.910 --> 17:45.310
And then
I'm resigned to living

17:45.510 --> 17:46.710
in your shadow
the rest of my life.

17:46.910 --> 17:48.410
Yeah, well, I hate
to break it to you,

17:48.610 --> 17:50.420
but you're already
in my shadow.

17:50.620 --> 17:52.850
(snorts) You wish.
(laughs)

17:53.050 --> 17:55.020
Got jokes today.

17:55.220 --> 17:56.550
Uh, hey.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.790
Look at that little nugget
over there sucking up to Vince.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.860
(laughs) Looks like
it's working, too.

18:01.060 --> 18:02.560
EVE: Wait.
Should we be nervous,

18:02.760 --> 18:05.200
living in the shadow
of the nugget?
Yeah, no.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.530
(snorts)

18:06.730 --> 18:09.580
Ready water!
BODE: We're ready!

18:11.090 --> 18:13.410
Hey, Freddy, sorry
about the rock shower.

18:13.610 --> 18:16.310
Uh, my man Bode saved my life.

18:16.510 --> 18:18.940
Well, I'm glad you're good.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.280
FREDDY:
He almost died.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.010
You glad he's
doing good, too?

18:22.210 --> 18:23.550
Freddy.
What?

18:23.750 --> 18:26.050
FREDDY:
Two of you working
alongside one another.

18:26.250 --> 18:30.560
Got an opportunity
to clear the air. Let's go.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.590
There's no air to clear.

18:33.790 --> 18:35.290
Yeah, we're good, Freddy.

18:35.490 --> 18:36.730
FREDDY: Oh, yeah?
'Cause rumor has it

18:36.930 --> 18:39.560
you think my man here
is unsalvageable,

18:39.760 --> 18:42.570
but I'm here to tell you,
he's a flea market find.

18:42.770 --> 18:44.270
All he needs is
a little spit polish.

18:44.470 --> 18:45.570
HARLAN:
Hey!

18:45.770 --> 18:46.900
How about a little less talking,

18:47.100 --> 18:48.710
and a little more working,
please?

18:48.910 --> 18:50.310
GABRIELA:
We're working
as fast as we can.

18:50.510 --> 18:52.480
I ran a printing shop.
I managed 20 people.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.080
I can tell you, nobody works
as fast as they can.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.780
Well, maybe if you stop yelling
at us, we can get back to work.

18:57.980 --> 18:59.350
What? What did you say?
BODE:
Hey!

18:59.550 --> 19:00.650
Hey, whoa, whoa, back off, man.

19:00.850 --> 19:02.450
You back off.
Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey.

19:02.650 --> 19:03.560
We're on your side, bro.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.920
Well, then, get to work.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.180
Ooh.

19:08.780 --> 19:12.030
FREDDY:
Oh, why am I here? Huh?

19:12.230 --> 19:13.570
I'm risking my life
for this fool?

19:13.770 --> 19:16.100
Freddy, just calm down,
all right?

19:16.300 --> 19:17.940
Just chill out,
think about the baby.

19:18.140 --> 19:20.310
Oh, my God.
Freddy, your baby.

19:20.510 --> 19:22.510
I totally forgot
to congratulate you.

19:22.710 --> 19:24.010
She's so cute.

19:24.210 --> 19:26.040
You saw her?

19:26.240 --> 19:28.080
Yeah. We all did.

19:28.280 --> 19:29.900
I thought you knew.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.560
Hey,
guy-I've-never-seen-before,

19:38.760 --> 19:40.580
have <i>you</i> seen my baby?

19:50.150 --> 19:52.050
Freddy? Hey.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.510
What are you doing?

19:56.710 --> 19:59.380
I'm going to see my kid.
And then what?

19:59.580 --> 20:01.450
What happens
after you see the baby?

20:01.650 --> 20:02.850
They're gonna
come looking for you.

20:03.050 --> 20:04.620
I want to be a dad to my kid,
and I can't!

20:04.820 --> 20:07.320
You can't understand that,
Bode. None of you can!

20:07.520 --> 20:09.720
I used to wish that my dad
would escape and come get me

20:09.920 --> 20:11.260
and that we'd be on the run.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.160
I'd dream of it.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.890
But that was a child's dream,
and now that I'm grown up,

20:16.090 --> 20:17.530
I'm glad
my dad did his time right.

20:17.730 --> 20:19.800
I just want to see my baby.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.970
I need to see my baby.

20:22.170 --> 20:25.400
Hey, you-you leave here,
you're walking into a fire.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.020
Like Cap says,
you better have a way out.

20:30.260 --> 20:32.890
You're gonna see
your kid.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.650
And, you know,
when-when she grows up,

20:35.850 --> 20:37.420
you can tell her about today

20:37.620 --> 20:40.850
and about how you overcame this
urge to do something impulsive.

20:41.050 --> 20:43.090
How you changed
and-and grew.

20:43.290 --> 20:46.810
And she's gonna be
in awe of you, like I am.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.850
Thanks, bro.

20:57.350 --> 20:59.090
I got you.

20:59.850 --> 21:01.760
I got you, too.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.960
But talk to her.

21:05.730 --> 21:07.930
I'm going back.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.930
(sighs)

21:14.570 --> 21:16.940
I'm trying to change, Gab.

21:17.770 --> 21:20.430
I-I really am, for you.

21:20.630 --> 21:23.460
Stop trying to impress me.

21:23.660 --> 21:25.830
You want
to change?

21:26.030 --> 21:27.300
Okay.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.600
Do it, but do it for yourself.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.670
Don't do it for me.

21:32.870 --> 21:35.070
(horses neighing in distance)

21:35.270 --> 21:36.790
Gab.

21:42.530 --> 21:43.680
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Come on.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.120
We got to move off the road.
What's going on?

21:46.320 --> 21:48.300
* *

21:55.480 --> 21:58.010
(neighing)

22:00.680 --> 22:03.100
GABRIELA:
Where are they running?

22:03.300 --> 22:05.950
They're running away
from the fire. It's coming.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.810
(indistinct radio chatter)

22:16.010 --> 22:17.720
VINCE:
Keep going, guys.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.370
Fire's spreading faster
than I hoped.

22:24.970 --> 22:27.690
Well, you wanted to see flames.
There they are.

22:27.890 --> 22:30.180
Now's the time, Harlan.

22:35.820 --> 22:37.470
Okay.

22:37.670 --> 22:40.540
You can evacuate my wife.

22:40.740 --> 22:42.210
Your wi--

22:42.410 --> 22:44.290
You said it was just you.

22:45.660 --> 22:48.980
We evacuated a year ago,
and it set her back.

22:49.180 --> 22:51.930
She's got heart failure, COPD.

22:53.030 --> 22:55.350
She's got COPD? Man.

22:55.550 --> 22:57.660
Harlan, this air is not good
for her lungs.

22:57.860 --> 22:59.890
You don't think I don't know
the 16 different ways

23:00.090 --> 23:01.690
I've screwed this up?

23:01.890 --> 23:06.310
But until you have a dying wife,
don't come at me, okay?

23:11.990 --> 23:13.410
MANNY: All right, fellas,
this fire's growing,

23:13.610 --> 23:15.290
so keep those hoses going.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.450
For 43 years,

23:23.650 --> 23:26.250
I paid those premiums on time.

23:26.450 --> 23:28.940
Two months ago, I stopped.

23:30.300 --> 23:32.160
You got to be kidding me.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.830
My wife's medicine's expensive.

23:35.030 --> 23:38.450
It was the medicine,
or the homeowner's insurance.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.470
This place goes,

23:43.670 --> 23:45.800
I'm literally destitute.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.990
A burden to my kid,
no good to my wife.

23:50.560 --> 23:53.110
You-you tried calling
the insurance company, and...

23:53.310 --> 23:54.810
Yeah.

23:55.010 --> 23:58.970
Yeah, some 25-year-old told me
there was nothing they can do.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.470
I'm gonna tell her
she's leaving.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.880
Hey!
Hey.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.940
I heard you matched.

24:26.140 --> 24:28.400
Oh, word gets around.

24:32.770 --> 24:35.020
It's good to see you
out here thriving.

24:35.220 --> 24:38.020
I, uh...
I just don't want you

24:38.220 --> 24:40.120
to do something
that you'd regret.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.630
Like save my mom's life?

24:42.830 --> 24:44.830
I wouldn't regret that.

24:45.030 --> 24:47.670
No. I-I... I know. Uh...

24:47.870 --> 24:49.870
Man, this is coming
out all wrong.

24:50.070 --> 24:52.050
Yeah, it is.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.810
Bode...

24:58.010 --> 24:58.880
it's a big deal.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.550
It's a big life decision.
I mean,

25:00.750 --> 25:03.930
there could be complications in
the surgery, or even later on.

25:05.230 --> 25:07.330
Just think about it.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.020
Yeah. Okay.

25:11.220 --> 25:13.410
Well, thank you for that.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.750
Hey, why you trying
to talk him out of it?

25:28.590 --> 25:30.440
So what do we do?

25:30.640 --> 25:32.210
Call Harlan's bluff?

25:32.410 --> 25:34.450
Take the gamble that if
we evacuate, he'll follow?

25:34.650 --> 25:36.610
That's your call.
I'm asking for your input.

25:36.810 --> 25:39.820
Well, as the only guy
in the room

25:40.020 --> 25:42.190
who knows what it feels like
to lose a house,

25:42.390 --> 25:45.840
have we done everything we can?

25:48.110 --> 25:49.580
(phone buzzes)

25:50.810 --> 25:52.260
Hey, Shar?
SHARON (on phone):
Hey.

25:52.460 --> 25:56.130
You said you were sending a-a
tanker with some fire retardant.

25:56.330 --> 25:57.840
You got an ETA?

25:58.040 --> 26:00.020
* *

26:04.730 --> 26:06.010
HARLAN:
I-I talked to Mia.

26:06.210 --> 26:08.910
Sh-She's gonna be waiting
for you at the apartment.

26:09.110 --> 26:11.380
I'll be there soon. I'm just
gonna get some of our stuff.

26:11.580 --> 26:13.970
Everything's gonna be fine.

26:14.970 --> 26:17.070
I... I promise.

26:18.540 --> 26:20.390
(garbled radio transmission)

26:20.590 --> 26:22.840
(ambulance door closes)

26:24.510 --> 26:26.230
(engine starts)

26:26.430 --> 26:28.480
(siren wails)

26:30.080 --> 26:32.650
It was the right thing
to do, Harlan.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.510
Am I gonna lose my house?

26:42.710 --> 26:45.170
We're gonna give it
everything we got.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.890
Let's see
if this slows the fire down.

26:50.090 --> 26:52.770
You might want to take
some cover under there.

26:54.110 --> 26:56.130
MAN (over radio):
About to drop the retardant!

26:56.330 --> 26:58.550
Copy that. Drop coming!

27:05.490 --> 27:06.570
What is this?

27:06.770 --> 27:07.940
Fire retardant.

27:08.140 --> 27:09.170
It's insane!

27:09.370 --> 27:10.710
It's also hard to wash off.

27:10.910 --> 27:12.980
You'll be finding it
in your clothes for weeks.

27:13.180 --> 27:15.010
This stuff stings!

27:15.210 --> 27:17.200
(indistinct shouting)

27:31.950 --> 27:35.600
Hey! I stepped
on the rock, not her.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.270
I told the chief.

27:37.470 --> 27:38.540
You did?
Felt bad about it.

27:38.740 --> 27:41.860
Oh, you're an honest
nugget, huh?

27:43.120 --> 27:45.160
(indistinct chatter)

27:55.540 --> 27:58.640
(garbled radio transmission)

27:59.870 --> 28:01.810
BODE:
That retardant wasn't enough.

28:02.610 --> 28:04.980
(flames crackling)

28:11.020 --> 28:13.290
Hey! Hey, we got fire
on the house!

28:14.460 --> 28:16.170
Whoa, there's fire
on the house. Hey!
FREDDY: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:16.370 --> 28:17.510
(indistinct shouting)

28:17.710 --> 28:19.630
Fire on the roof!

28:20.430 --> 28:23.830
(coughing)

28:25.400 --> 28:27.380
Give me all the water you got!

28:27.580 --> 28:30.570
MANNY:
Put dirt on the embers,
on everything! Let's do this!

28:32.140 --> 28:34.360
Chief, the house is toast.
More water!

28:34.560 --> 28:37.040
Come on! Let's go!

28:40.610 --> 28:42.050
MANNY:
Vince.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.670
We're way past trigger points.
Do we call it?

28:45.870 --> 28:48.540
(groans) I hate losing
to a damn fire.

28:48.740 --> 28:50.670
We haven't lost anything, man.
We still have all of our guys.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.590
Let's keep it that way.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.380
Sorry, Harlan. Did everything
we could. Got to go.

28:57.580 --> 28:59.420
My wallet's inside,
my credit cards.
It's time to go, Harlan.

28:59.620 --> 29:03.290
I got $500...
I will give you $500!
Let's go, all right?

29:03.490 --> 29:04.820
Everybody,

29:05.020 --> 29:06.890
to the safety zone!
Let's go! Now, now, now!

29:07.090 --> 29:08.530
Let's go, Three Rock!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

29:08.730 --> 29:10.390
Move it!

29:10.590 --> 29:11.830
VINCE: 42
and Three Rock

29:12.030 --> 29:14.280
heading to the safety zone.

29:17.950 --> 29:20.070
All right,
Cal Fire on the left,

29:20.270 --> 29:22.590
Three Rock on the right.
Everyone count off.

29:24.660 --> 29:26.310
Station 42 accounted for.

29:26.510 --> 29:28.960
Harlan? Where's Harlan?

29:33.400 --> 29:35.250
Hey, Cap,
we're missing one.

29:35.450 --> 29:36.550
Let me guess.

29:36.750 --> 29:38.460
Bode?
MANNY:
Bode?

29:38.660 --> 29:39.940
Bode, come on!

29:50.180 --> 29:52.020
Harlan? Hello?

29:53.020 --> 29:54.990
(Harlan coughing)
Harlan?!

29:56.420 --> 29:58.480
We got to go! We got to go!

29:58.680 --> 30:01.080
I can't find my wallet.
Your wallet doesn't matter.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.780
It's got all my money.
Let's go!

30:02.980 --> 30:04.250
(gasps)

30:04.450 --> 30:06.480
You're gonna have to jump.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.350
I can't!
Look, this house--

30:08.550 --> 30:09.790
it's gonna kill you
in 30 seconds.

30:09.990 --> 30:11.460
Where am I gonna live?
I heard

30:11.660 --> 30:13.020
that you have a daughter.
No. She doesn't want to have

30:13.220 --> 30:14.260
to take care of her mom and me.

30:14.460 --> 30:15.730
You don't know that. Come on.

30:15.930 --> 30:18.060
Just stop being stubborn
and give her a chance.

30:18.260 --> 30:20.400
I can't.
Look, I-I...

30:20.600 --> 30:22.100
I can't...
I can't get to you.

30:22.300 --> 30:23.820
Jump!

30:24.790 --> 30:26.440
I'm sorry.

30:26.640 --> 30:28.460
I'm staying.

30:33.460 --> 30:35.360
Bode?!

30:36.130 --> 30:37.930
Bode?!

30:39.100 --> 30:40.520
Bode?!

30:40.720 --> 30:43.250
(loud coughing)

30:43.450 --> 30:44.820
Bode.

30:45.020 --> 30:48.330
I s... I saw-saw him go back in,
so I followed him.

30:48.530 --> 30:50.330
There was... there was
no time to tell you.

30:50.530 --> 30:51.660
Hey, it's okay.

30:51.860 --> 30:53.200
It's all right.
(panting):
I-I...

30:53.400 --> 30:55.000
I couldn't get to him.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.570
I cou... I-I... I begged him
to jump, and he wouldn't jump.

30:57.770 --> 30:59.100
And the fire
was just...

30:59.300 --> 31:00.800
I wa... I was gonna die.
VINCE:
It's all right.

31:01.010 --> 31:02.210
I didn't want...
I didn't want to die.
Bode,

31:02.410 --> 31:03.740
it's all right.

31:03.940 --> 31:05.240
You're okay, Bode.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.080
But he's in there.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.180
VINCE: You did
the right thing.

31:09.380 --> 31:11.250
(Harlan coughing)

31:11.450 --> 31:13.320
(coughing)
MANNY:
Look!

31:13.520 --> 31:15.890
Harlan? Harlan!

31:16.090 --> 31:18.860
Harlan!
Come on, let's get him up.

31:19.060 --> 31:20.320
(coughing)

31:20.520 --> 31:22.440
We got you.
(groans)

31:23.410 --> 31:25.710
Thank you.
Thank you.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.680
(coughing)

31:30.320 --> 31:32.370
SHARON: <i>We'll probably do</i>
<i>one more water drop</i>

31:32.570 --> 31:34.640
before the tankers head
back to base,

31:34.840 --> 31:36.510
but it looks like
the fire stopped

31:36.710 --> 31:38.210
on the top of the ridge.

31:38.410 --> 31:39.810
But most importantly,

31:40.010 --> 31:42.700
everybody came off
that mountain alive today.

31:43.900 --> 31:47.320
And seeing you all
here covered in pink

31:47.520 --> 31:49.520
makes it really hit home

31:49.720 --> 31:50.750
that you are one crew.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.590
You wear
different uniforms,

31:52.790 --> 31:56.060
you have different
skills, different tools,

31:56.260 --> 31:57.260
different leaders,

31:57.460 --> 31:59.800
but you fight the same fight.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.870
So thank you.

32:02.070 --> 32:04.720
And before we head home,
where's Freddy?

32:05.520 --> 32:09.470
Congratulations from
everyone at Cal Fire.

32:09.670 --> 32:13.380
This is one hell of
a gender reveal party.

32:13.580 --> 32:14.910
(laughter)

32:15.110 --> 32:16.210
(whistling)
Congrats, Freddy!

32:16.410 --> 32:17.410
Attaboy, Freddy.

32:17.610 --> 32:19.480
(Sharon laughs)
Hey, Papa Freddy!

32:19.680 --> 32:23.000
All right, let's go home
and get cleaned up.

32:26.210 --> 32:27.590
Here me out, Gabs.

32:27.790 --> 32:30.190
Bode ran into the fire.
Impulsive.

32:30.390 --> 32:32.100
But the dude also made
the difficult

32:32.300 --> 32:34.630
but mature decision
to save himself and run out.

32:34.830 --> 32:36.680
That's progress. Am I right?

32:37.580 --> 32:39.970
Yeah, it is.
So tell him.

32:40.170 --> 32:41.970
Just do me this, okay?

32:42.170 --> 32:43.910
Do me this solid.

32:44.110 --> 32:46.510
Okay.
Yes! Ah!

32:46.710 --> 32:49.230
Mm.
Great work out there
today, <i>mija.</i>

32:50.230 --> 32:51.220
I'm proud of you.

32:51.420 --> 32:52.800
Thanks, Dad.

32:53.770 --> 32:55.420
You hear that word, Freddy?

32:55.620 --> 32:57.450
"Dad"?

32:57.650 --> 33:00.160
I hear it, sir.
Still can't believe it.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.290
Listen, I heard you got some
retardant in your eye today.

33:02.490 --> 33:03.630
Yeah.

33:03.830 --> 33:05.500
That stuff is nasty.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.330
Maybe we should go
get that checked out.

33:07.530 --> 33:08.930
Nah, nah, I'm-I'm good.

33:09.130 --> 33:10.930
No, I think maybe
we should go to the hospital.

33:11.140 --> 33:12.340
No. Seriously, Cap,

33:12.540 --> 33:14.370
I'm-I'm-I'm beat.
Freddy,

33:14.570 --> 33:16.340
you want to see your baby?

33:16.540 --> 33:17.440
What?

33:17.640 --> 33:19.480
GABRIELA:
He needs you

33:19.680 --> 33:22.060
to formally complain
about your eyes.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.450
Oh. Oh!

33:24.650 --> 33:27.320
Yes, my eyes--
they-they... they sting.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.020
Bad.
(laughing)

33:29.220 --> 33:32.190
I can't see nothing.
Y'all blurry... Chief.

33:32.390 --> 33:33.520
(laughter)

33:33.720 --> 33:34.930
(indistinct chatter)

33:35.130 --> 33:39.200
Hey, when I...
when I first got here,

33:39.400 --> 33:42.220
you know, I might have run
into that fire and not run out.

33:43.650 --> 33:45.840
I just-- I didn't...

33:46.040 --> 33:47.370
I didn't really
see my life

33:47.570 --> 33:49.760
having much value.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.660
But I'm starting
to think that...

33:55.530 --> 33:57.210
...maybe there is hope for me.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.900
That is all I see.

34:01.270 --> 34:03.170
Let me donate.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.720
At-at-at least

34:05.920 --> 34:07.890
let me move forward
in the process.

34:08.090 --> 34:09.760
I've-I've caused

34:09.960 --> 34:12.150
so much pain to you guys.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.370
Maybe this can even the score.

34:16.570 --> 34:18.870
There is no score.

34:19.070 --> 34:23.140
I can't...
I can't let you do that for me.

34:23.340 --> 34:26.330
You'd be doing it for me.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.810
(exhales loudly)

34:31.010 --> 34:35.740
If you let me save your life,
you'd be saving mine.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.070
VINCE:
Listen, Bode.

34:40.270 --> 34:44.360
You know,
I've struggled a lot with...

34:44.560 --> 34:48.770
my, uh, disappointment
in some of your choices

34:48.970 --> 34:50.570
over the past
few years but, um,

34:50.770 --> 34:53.120
I got to tell you, I...

34:54.260 --> 34:56.310
I don't think
I've ever been more proud of you

34:56.510 --> 34:58.630
than I am right now.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.500
(wind whistling,
insects chirping)

35:18.700 --> 35:20.880
(steam hissing)

35:23.380 --> 35:25.420
(sighs)

35:26.220 --> 35:28.370
I'm headed out to meet my kid.
Cap is taking me.

35:28.570 --> 35:30.010
Oh, and while I'm gone,

35:30.210 --> 35:32.740
if you can get me a new Nomex?
Mine is in the laundry.

35:32.940 --> 35:35.580
Yeah, mine is, too. Just
get new ones tomorrow.

35:35.780 --> 35:37.480
I think you should go tonight.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.680
Why? What's your problem, bro?

35:39.880 --> 35:41.690
I'm heading out now.

35:41.890 --> 35:45.090
Uh, maybe you head over
in 20, just to be safe?

35:45.290 --> 35:47.740
Trust your boy, Bode.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.320
(door opens)

36:07.390 --> 36:08.810
(door closes)

36:09.010 --> 36:10.850
MANNY:
<i>She's checked out</i>
<i>of the hospital,</i>

36:11.050 --> 36:14.450
and Cookie's mom's on her way up
to take her back to L.A.

36:14.650 --> 36:16.390
But the Leones

36:16.590 --> 36:20.160
are gonna let them stay
for a few nights.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.830
(baby coos)

36:23.030 --> 36:25.760
C-Can-can I hold my daughter?

36:25.960 --> 36:28.180
You better.

36:32.290 --> 36:34.410
I'm gonna be in
the other room.

36:34.610 --> 36:37.090
You two have
about an hour.

36:38.890 --> 36:41.310
(baby cooing)

36:41.510 --> 36:42.750
Oh...

36:42.950 --> 36:44.780
(baby fussing)
Oh.

36:44.980 --> 36:47.400
Very nice of you guys
to let her stay.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.470
Oh. Yeah, well,
we had the room.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.020
Hey, listen, I want
you both to know

36:54.220 --> 36:56.660
that I signed up
for overtime.

36:56.860 --> 36:59.300
Gonna put together enough money
so I can get my own place.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.960
Oh, don't worry about it.
There's no rush.

37:01.160 --> 37:02.400
Yeah.
MANNY: Yeah,
it's crazy.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.670
I remember when Gabriela was
born, thinking,

37:05.870 --> 37:07.940
"You know, this is it.
Got a kid now.

37:08.140 --> 37:10.770
Got to get your act together."
(laughs)

37:10.970 --> 37:12.610
And you did.

37:12.810 --> 37:14.880
You just, um,
had a setback.

37:15.080 --> 37:17.400
Got to give
yourself a break.

37:18.400 --> 37:21.340
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

37:24.470 --> 37:26.740
(baby cooing)

37:27.710 --> 37:30.740
(whistling)

37:33.750 --> 37:35.880
(clunks)

37:41.250 --> 37:43.370
(chuffs) Hey, bro.
Hey.

37:43.570 --> 37:45.760
Are you okay?

37:47.490 --> 37:49.110
Yeah.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.300
You sure?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.940
(soft chuckle)

37:58.240 --> 38:01.590
You know what I was
for Halloween when I was two?

38:01.790 --> 38:04.360
A firefighter.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.950
And when I was three?

38:07.980 --> 38:10.500
A firefighter.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.800
And four through 14?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.310
You were still trick-or-treating
when you were 14?

38:14.510 --> 38:16.310
(both laugh softly)

38:16.510 --> 38:18.480
Yeah.
(laughs)

38:18.680 --> 38:21.160
Yeah, as a firefighter.

38:23.160 --> 38:26.150
Eve, all I know how
to be is a firefighter.

38:26.350 --> 38:29.650
Well, it's a good thing you're
a firefighter then. (laughs)

38:29.850 --> 38:31.320
I matched.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.220
Hmm?

38:33.420 --> 38:36.380
For Sharon,
I matched.

38:37.580 --> 38:39.800
Whoa.
And, um...

38:40.000 --> 38:42.430
I mean, I'm...
I'm a firefighter

38:42.630 --> 38:45.050
so I-I... I save people.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.070
I don't hesitate.

38:48.270 --> 38:50.060
But you're hesitating?

38:50.890 --> 38:54.010
Bode ran into that house.
I didn't.

38:54.210 --> 38:56.250
Well, you didn't see
Harlan go back in,

38:56.450 --> 38:58.250
and if you did,
you would have saved him.

38:58.450 --> 39:00.430
Would I?

39:03.370 --> 39:05.370
Hi.

39:08.340 --> 39:10.940
Hi.

39:14.250 --> 39:16.270
I guess, uh...
I guess Freddy really wanted us

39:16.470 --> 39:17.700
to clear the air.

39:17.900 --> 39:20.920
So do I.

39:27.830 --> 39:31.550
I'm sorry I was--

39:31.750 --> 39:34.590
I-I don't know--

39:34.790 --> 39:36.970
harsh, earlier.

39:37.770 --> 39:39.890
You weren't.

39:40.090 --> 39:42.560
And, you know,
you're right.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.600
I do need to do
this for me.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.980
So do I.

39:49.050 --> 39:51.770
Look, I'm starting over, too.

39:51.970 --> 39:54.070
And it's hard.

39:54.270 --> 39:56.840
I want to impress Vince

39:57.040 --> 39:59.940
and my dad,
even this new probie.

40:00.140 --> 40:03.810
I spend so much time
trying to impress everyone,

40:04.010 --> 40:06.320
when I just need
to impress me.

40:06.520 --> 40:10.320
I need to stop looking
for outside approval

40:10.520 --> 40:12.390
and just...

40:12.590 --> 40:14.730
find some...

40:14.930 --> 40:17.910
self-worth inside.

40:19.510 --> 40:21.630
You're trying to
impress the new probie?

40:21.830 --> 40:24.220
Are you jealous?

40:25.020 --> 40:26.900
Yeah.

40:27.100 --> 40:29.490
You shouldn't be.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.380
Yeah, but, you know,
he's free, and...

40:34.580 --> 40:36.610
I'm not.

40:36.810 --> 40:38.520
But you will be.

40:38.720 --> 40:40.570
In a year.

40:46.510 --> 40:51.060
* Love is a burning thing *

40:51.260 --> 40:52.830
You have some pink stuff
in your hair.

40:53.030 --> 40:58.180
* It makes a fiery ring *

41:00.090 --> 41:05.090
* Bound by wild desire *

41:05.930 --> 41:08.750
* I fell in *

41:08.950 --> 41:11.730
* To a ring of fire... *

41:13.200 --> 41:15.690
Oh, we can't. We can't.

41:15.890 --> 41:18.890
* To a burning ring of fire... *

41:19.090 --> 41:21.020
I know. I know.

41:21.220 --> 41:22.590
* Down, down... *

41:22.790 --> 41:24.130
Mm.

41:24.330 --> 41:26.300
We're gonna work on ourselves,

41:26.500 --> 41:28.730
so that by the end
of your sentence,

41:28.930 --> 41:31.100
we'll be good,

41:31.300 --> 41:34.240
and it'll be like
opening up a gift.

41:34.440 --> 41:35.640
* The ring of fire *

41:35.840 --> 41:38.730
It'll be so good.

41:41.390 --> 41:44.350
* Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh... *

41:44.550 --> 41:47.000
(Gabriela moans)

41:48.100 --> 41:50.590
(moans)

41:50.790 --> 41:52.670
(panting)

41:53.640 --> 41:54.680
Wait.

41:55.910 --> 42:00.450
* The taste of love is sweet *

42:02.050 --> 42:03.230
(exhales)

42:03.430 --> 42:07.650
* When hearts like ours meet *

42:08.960 --> 42:11.880
* I fell for you like a child *

42:12.080 --> 42:14.390
(door opens, closes)

42:15.600 --> 42:20.430
* Oh, and the fire went wild *

42:22.770 --> 42:25.360
* I fell into *

42:25.560 --> 42:28.890
* A burning ring of fire *

42:29.090 --> 42:31.900
* I went down, down, down *

42:32.100 --> 42:35.230
* And the flames went higher *

42:35.430 --> 42:39.370
* And it burns, burns, burns *

42:39.570 --> 42:44.420
* The ring of fire... *
