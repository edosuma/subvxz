00:58.851 --> 01:01.227
Dr. Wolfenstein.

01:01.311 --> 01:05.815
l will be with you until the end.

01:13.657 --> 01:14.907
Howdy, folks!

01:14.992 --> 01:17.535
You like blood, violence,
and freaks of nature?

01:17.619 --> 01:19.996
Well, then, come on down
to Captain Spaulding's

01:20.080 --> 01:22.248
Museum of Monsters and Madmen.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.917
Yeah, see the Alligator Boy.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.086
Ride my famous Murder Ride.

01:27.171 --> 01:32.008
Most of all, don't forget to take home
some of my tasty fried chicken.

01:34.470 --> 01:36.721
ltjust tastes so damn good.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.783
...decapitated with a meat cleaver.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.747
See it, hear it, and actually feel it.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.752
Coming after you to rip your flesh apart.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.341
Unbelievable but true.

02:16.345 --> 02:19.722
See it, hear it, and actually feel it.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.894
Fresh meat.

02:33.779 --> 02:37.323
Shit. l can't do nothing with this now.
l can't get rid of this.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.117
lt ain't worth nothing. My name's all over it.

02:40.202 --> 02:43.246
l was fixing to trade it to Jackie Cobb.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.082
That retard that hangs out
at Molly's Fruit Stand?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.792
-Yeah.
-You know, for the life of me,

02:47.876 --> 02:50.253
l cannot understand
why you hang out with that asshole.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.004
He's one horny retard.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.256
Well, hell, ain't they all?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.841
All they want to do is eat and fuck.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.927
Well, if you knew him,
you might understand his urges.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.471
Worse than a rabid-ass baboon.

03:00.556 --> 03:04.308
Yeah. You know what his favorite thing is
next to whacking his weasel?

03:04.393 --> 03:08.604
He takes a sharpened pencil
and sticks it in his eyeball and twists it.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.690
-What?
-He doesn't hurt himself, though.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.526
He kind of twists it right next to his eyeball.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.404
He's been putting that pencil
someplace other than his eyeball.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.573
Nah, he don't do nothing like that.

03:18.657 --> 03:19.949
Although, once, he got caught,

03:20.033 --> 03:23.578
you know, with a Planet ofthe Apes doll
stuck up his asshole.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.789
Goddamn!

03:26.874 --> 03:29.417
Yeah, they had to take him to the hospital.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.128
Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck halfway up his butt.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.921
Couldn't get it out.

03:35.465 --> 03:39.010
See it, hear it, and actually feel it.

03:41.513 --> 03:45.182
Coming after you to rip your flesh apart.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.143
Did you fix the toilet yet?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.227
Yes, l did,

03:48.312 --> 03:51.898
and l don't want you stuffing
any goddamn paper towels down there.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.317
l had to snake the shit out that thing.

03:54.818 --> 03:55.985
Here you go.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.322
Now, you bust that crapper,
l'm gonna bust your ass.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.616
l hear you.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.994
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

04:19.885 --> 04:22.345
Hairy fucking Moses!
Y'all get the fuck out of here!

04:22.429 --> 04:24.931
Cool it, clowny!
Keep your paws where l can see them!

04:25.015 --> 04:26.182
Yeah, don't move!

04:26.266 --> 04:29.226
Or l'll blast a hole
the size of a Kansas City watermelon

04:29.311 --> 04:31.729
through your ugly-ass bozo-face!

04:31.813 --> 04:33.773
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

04:33.857 --> 04:35.858
Go grab that other asshole
out of the shitter

04:35.943 --> 04:37.777
and drag his ass back in here.

04:37.861 --> 04:38.861
Right.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.448
You miserable motherfuck...

04:42.532 --> 04:45.952
l ought to jump over this counter
and bash your fucking balls in!

04:46.036 --> 04:48.746
All right, Pippi, hand over the cash box,

04:48.830 --> 04:51.832
and l might
leave your brains inside your skull.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.918
Well, l'll tell you what, Ski King.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.629
Why don't you just take
your Mama home some chicken,

04:56.713 --> 04:59.757
and then l won't have to stuff my boot
all up in your ass.

04:59.841 --> 05:03.552
l don't like chicken. And l hate clowns!

05:08.684 --> 05:10.977
Let's see, l get it all? l got all this...

05:11.061 --> 05:12.770
-Put that shit down!
-All right!

05:12.854 --> 05:14.855
Put it down! Fuck!

05:17.609 --> 05:19.151
That is it!

05:19.236 --> 05:22.530
l'm gonna count to 1 0,
and you're gonna hand over all the cash,

05:22.614 --> 05:26.575
or l'm gonna splatter your greasepaint mug
across the state line.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.536
-One!
-Fuck your mama!

05:28.620 --> 05:30.496
-Two!
-Fuck your sister!

05:30.580 --> 05:32.164
What are we gonna do?

05:32.249 --> 05:34.417
Hey, l know you.
You work at the hardware store, right?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.502
-Richard Wick, right?
-Shut your trap!

05:36.586 --> 05:38.212
Quiet down! Both of you!

05:38.296 --> 05:40.006
-Three!
-Fuck your grandma!

05:40.090 --> 05:41.048
Hey, l remember now.

05:41.133 --> 05:44.301
All the guys made fun of you,
called you "Little Dick" Wick.

05:44.386 --> 05:45.428
Shut up!

05:49.599 --> 05:51.350
Stop singing! l hate that song!

05:51.435 --> 05:53.394
Get your fucking mask back on!

05:55.439 --> 05:56.897
Oh, fuck it!

06:19.546 --> 06:22.048
Most of all, fuck you!

06:24.593 --> 06:28.095
Goddamn motherfucker
got blood all over my best clown suit!

08:24.254 --> 08:26.922
How many want a touch this afternoon?

08:27.507 --> 08:30.092
Raise your hand
if you want God to touch you.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.971
l'm gonna pray that God
will give you a divine touch...

08:36.640 --> 08:38.392
The U.S. Department of Agriculture

08:38.476 --> 08:41.020
is checking whether state
meat and poultry inspectors

08:41.104 --> 08:43.688
are good enough to allow the product
to go on sale nationally.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.608
The USDA has said...

08:45.692 --> 08:47.776
Man, some of these Manson chicks
are really hot.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.737
Shit! How are we almost out of gas?

08:49.821 --> 08:52.531
Look, and this Squeaky. Right here.
That's a girl you would date.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.824
Jerry, how much did you put in?

08:53.909 --> 08:55.910
l don't know. Two, three bucks.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.037
Two, three bucks?
l told you to fill the tank!

08:58.121 --> 09:00.331
Bill, feel me. Am l made of money? Get off.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.957
Jesus Christ, Jerry.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.002
Don't panic yourself there,
way-too-much-caffeine-guy.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.213
You know, l wouldn't be drinking
so much coffee

09:07.297 --> 09:09.215
if you did your share of the driving.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.050
-You know l don't have night vision.
-Not this again.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.968
Seriously, l can't even make out the lines
on the road.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.094
-Oh, please.
-Fine, Bill. You know what?

09:14.179 --> 09:15.179
You want to pull the car over?

09:15.263 --> 09:17.556
l'd be more than happy to kill us out here
in the middle of nowhere.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.725
Look, besides,
there's a billboard, right there.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.977
"Captain Spaulding's
Museum of Monsters and Madmen."

09:22.062 --> 09:24.396
Oh, that sounds great!
"Fried chicken and gasoline."

09:24.481 --> 09:26.732
Next exit. There you go. Problem solved.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.735
And we didn't have to freak out.
No big deal, Bill.

09:30.654 --> 09:31.654
Dick.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.204
All right, l'll pump the gas.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.747
Go inside and see
if it's worth checking out.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.457
Okay, Mr. Cranky.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.382
Holy crap! You gotta see this place!
lt's boss.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.342
-Yeah, how boss?
-Really fucking boss.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.678
Like wake up the chicks
and break out the camera boss?

09:55.762 --> 09:56.887
Hell, yeah.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.521
Wakey-wakey! Eggs and bacon!

10:06.481 --> 10:07.856
Hey, sweetie, come on.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.109
Grab Mary and get your stuff
and come on inside.

10:10.193 --> 10:13.237
Bill and l found a kick-ass place.
Come on, move, move!

10:18.868 --> 10:19.868
Let's go.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.872
Come on, Sleeping Beauty.
lt's time to go to work.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.594
What's in that case over there?

10:37.679 --> 10:38.721
Hairless monkey.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.391
Did you see the Crocodile Boy?

10:42.892 --> 10:45.394
How'd you like to find that in your pants?

10:47.439 --> 10:48.731
Excuse me, sir?

10:49.399 --> 10:50.649
-Howdy.
-Hi.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.151
l love this place.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.069
How long you been running this place?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.237
Well...

10:55.322 --> 10:57.239
How long's a piece of string?

10:58.950 --> 11:00.200
l don't know.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.037
Too goddamn long, that's how long.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.289
Too goddamn long. That's right.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.500
l hear that. But how long, actually?

11:08.585 --> 11:10.544
Oh, shit, l don't know exactly.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.380
l took over from my pa

11:13.465 --> 11:15.758
right after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.509
You mean John Wayne.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.346
Hell, son, how many Dukes
do you know about?

11:20.430 --> 11:23.015
Greatest American ever lived. Look at that!

11:23.099 --> 11:25.684
Circle up the wagons, Pilgrims.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.519
Whatever you say, Cowboy.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.607
Yeah, l'm not that much of a Western fan.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.609
l like science fiction.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.444
Space boy.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.239
Yeah, well, l figured as much.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.700
Let me ask you something.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.912
How come you asking
so many jackassy questions?

11:44.996 --> 11:47.247
You see, my friends and l,
we're driving across country.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.542
We're writing this book, actually,
on offbeat roadside attractions.

11:50.627 --> 11:53.921
You know, the crazy shit you see
when you're driving across the country.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.923
l don't drive across country.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.133
But if you did?

11:58.927 --> 12:00.052
But l don't.

12:00.470 --> 12:04.223
Yeah, but just supposing
for a second that you did...

12:07.727 --> 12:09.269
You little dickens, you.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.064
-l know what your problem is.
-What's that?

12:12.857 --> 12:16.485
Y'all think us folks from the country
grew up funny-like, don't you?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.737
-Jerry!
-Yeah, we'll saddle up the mule, Ma!

12:18.822 --> 12:21.907
Slide me some grits!
l's got to get me some education.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.909
-Jerry!
-You asshole!

12:23.993 --> 12:27.496
No, no, l really am very interested.
l'm not trying to make fun.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.416
Got you!

12:32.335 --> 12:34.628
You are such a bad clown.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.755
Oh, fuck these sights!

12:36.840 --> 12:40.300
Who the hell would want to read
about all this horseshit, anyway?

12:40.385 --> 12:41.844
You'd be surprised.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.179
Son, look around.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.432
Would l be surprised?

12:51.396 --> 12:53.730
Oh, finally! Great, great, come on!
We paid for the tickets.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.941
-Let's go, let's go, let's go!
-What tickets?

12:56.025 --> 12:59.027
This isn't everything.
There is actually a Murder Ride.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.154
A Murder Ride?

13:00.238 --> 13:01.613
l don't want to go on a Murder Ride.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.657
-Yes, you do want to go on a Murder Ride.
-No, l don't.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.326
Hey, how about if we skip the Murder Ride?

13:06.411 --> 13:08.370
Hey, how about if we go?

13:08.455 --> 13:09.955
Anytime this year, people.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.623
The tour is about to begin.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.543
Okay, we'll see you inside the Murder Ride.
We'll be back! Bye!

13:14.627 --> 13:18.505
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
children of all ages.

13:18.965 --> 13:22.384
You are about to enter a world of darkness,

13:22.927 --> 13:25.888
a world where
life and death are meaningless

13:26.306 --> 13:28.765
and pain is god.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.143
-Hey!
-Ravelli, let's go!

13:31.227 --> 13:33.270
Yeah! Murder Ride!

13:33.354 --> 13:36.064
-Plant your ass, boy!
-Sorry, Captain Spaulding.

13:36.774 --> 13:39.151
Yeah, we're gonna have a good time now.

13:41.237 --> 13:48.076
On your right,
you will see the infamous Albert Fish!

13:51.247 --> 13:56.752
Masochist, sadist, child killer
and most importantly...cannibal.

13:57.712 --> 14:00.422
Fish, born 1 870,

14:00.507 --> 14:03.383
enjoyed spankings
with nail-studded paddles,

14:03.468 --> 14:06.678
stuck needles deep into his groin.

14:06.763 --> 14:07.846
l have a question. How many nails...

14:07.931 --> 14:09.515
Hold all questions.

14:13.228 --> 14:15.771
Help! Help! Help!

14:22.820 --> 14:23.862
Lizzie fucking Borden!

14:23.947 --> 14:27.032
Now, one of our most famous crazies,

14:27.116 --> 14:30.827
the psycho of Plainfield, Mr. Ed Gein.

14:30.912 --> 14:32.704
Murderer, cannibal.

14:32.789 --> 14:37.751
Mr. Gein used to take great pleasure
in playing with the dead bodies of women.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.465
Especially the sexual organs.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.134
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

14:55.144 --> 14:58.480
Why? Why? Why?

15:00.733 --> 15:03.694
Now, one of our local heroes,

15:04.362 --> 15:09.074
S. Quentin Quale, a.k.a. Dr. Satan.

15:09.534 --> 15:10.909
Holy shit!

15:11.995 --> 15:15.664
Murderer, torturer, but most of all,
master surgeon.

15:16.416 --> 15:20.627
Mr. Quale was an intern
at the Willows County Mental Hospital,

15:21.754 --> 15:26.133
nicknamed Weeping Willows
for the never-ending cries of pain.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.343
Through primitive brain surgery...

15:28.428 --> 15:29.428
Jerry, stop it!

15:29.512 --> 15:32.222
...Mr. Quale believed that he could create

15:32.307 --> 15:35.350
a race of superhumans
from the mentally ill.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.186
Vigilante justice prevailed.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.397
They took his ass out and hung him.

15:41.024 --> 15:44.151
And that infamous hanging tree

15:44.235 --> 15:48.905
is no more than a stone's throw away
from where y'all's ass is now seated.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.867
But the next day

15:52.994 --> 15:55.370
his body was found to be missing.

15:56.039 --> 16:02.628
Until today no trace of Dr. Satan
has ever been discovered.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.548
But then, who knows?

16:09.385 --> 16:11.678
Maybe he lives next door to you.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.557
Tour's over. Exit through the doors.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.857
That was so bad-ass!

16:23.941 --> 16:26.693
Dr. Satan! Dr. Satan!

16:28.488 --> 16:31.281
Maybe he lives next door to you!

16:31.574 --> 16:33.408
Calm down. lt was all right.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.578
Yeah, do you think
maybe we could go now?

16:36.996 --> 16:39.498
Look, l'm gonna go call my dad, all right.
l'll be right back.

16:39.582 --> 16:40.916
l love you.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.960
What do you mean, "lt was all right"?

16:44.045 --> 16:46.338
l mean, it was cool, but it wasn't that great.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.716
Dude, you don't have to play it down
in front of your chick.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.176
Thank you.

17:03.648 --> 17:07.275
Don't move a muscle, an artery or a vein.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.069
-Hello.
-Hey, Dad.

17:10.946 --> 17:11.988
Denise!

17:12.073 --> 17:16.367
We stopped for gas
at this place called Captain Spaulding's,

17:16.452 --> 17:18.954
somewhere outside of Ruggsville, and...

17:19.038 --> 17:23.083
lt turned into this whole big thing,
so we're kind of behind schedule.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.835
Well, don't be too late.

17:24.919 --> 17:28.338
Oh, l forgot to tell you
that Halloween falls on a school night

17:28.423 --> 17:30.674
so they're trick-or-treating tonight.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.720
Your left hand shows your past.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.305
Your right hand shows your future.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.314
Good evening. l'm Lance Brockwell,
and this is the 7 O'clock News.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.150
And our top story tonight.

17:48.276 --> 17:51.236
lnvestigators still have no leads
in the strange disappearance

17:51.320 --> 17:53.905
of the five cheerleaders
from Ruggsville High School.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.032
Cindy Thompson, Karen Murphy,

17:56.117 --> 17:59.327
Allison Cole, Valerie Green,
and Dawn Baker

17:59.412 --> 18:01.872
were last seen four days ago
leaving a football game...

18:03.040 --> 18:05.333
l know it seems stupid,
but l really want to see this tree.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.794
Do yourself a favor, son.
Just forget about it.

18:07.879 --> 18:10.005
Oh, come on! l live for this shit.

18:10.673 --> 18:13.717
-Okay, all right, l'll draw you a damn map.
-Thank you.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.261
-l still say it's a waste of time.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.096
All right, you are here.

18:18.181 --> 18:21.641
Go straight up this road.
Make the first right, first left.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.727
Come straight across and down.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.729
You can't find it, tough.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.272
-Here's your map.
-Right on.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.566
-Here's your complimentary chicken.
-Oh, wow!

18:29.650 --> 18:32.235
Don't let the door hit you in the ass
on the way out.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.821
-You're gonna get a great write-up for this.
-Yeah!

18:46.125 --> 18:49.377
Here's an idea. Let's just skip it.
lt's probably nothing, anyway.

18:49.462 --> 18:53.048
Yeah, l mean, Christ, Jerry. Bill is right.
We can't see anything.

18:53.424 --> 18:54.591
What's that?

18:57.094 --> 18:58.220
Hitchhiker.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.223
-What, should we stop?
-We can't leave her out here in the rain.

19:01.307 --> 19:04.476
Stick her in the front
if you want to pick her up so bad.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.690
So, where you headed?

19:11.234 --> 19:13.735
-l was just going home.
-Home? Where's that?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.445
Couple more miles up the road.

19:15.530 --> 19:17.531
-So you live around here?
-Yeah.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.658
Hey, do you know where
this Dr. Satan tree is at?

19:19.742 --> 19:21.535
Yeah, l know where that's at.

19:21.619 --> 19:25.705
-lt's right by my house. l can show you.
-Really? So it is a real thing.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.043
So, the tree, what's that?

19:30.711 --> 19:33.505
-What tree?
-Okay, this is crazy.

19:33.589 --> 19:37.634
-She obviously doesn't know anything.
-Oh, l know. l'll show you where it's at.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.762
Whatever you need to do, you do it.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.098
There is no wrong.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.393
lf someone needs to be killed,
you kill them.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.520
That's the way.

20:04.829 --> 20:05.871
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

20:05.955 --> 20:08.456
-What's the problem, partner?
-Fucking tire.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.044
Oh, poop.

20:14.463 --> 20:15.463
Hell.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.675
At least we got that spare.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.970
-You filled it up like l asked, right?
-Yeah, yeah.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.892
Okay, now, what if l forgot
to put it back in the trunk?

20:26.976 --> 20:28.768
What would Plan "B" entail?

20:28.978 --> 20:30.520
Jesus Christ, Jerry!

20:30.605 --> 20:32.314
Well, technically, l did what you said!

20:32.398 --> 20:35.150
Oh, for fucking sake, Jerry,
what are we gonna do now?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.694
l can't rightly say if l know, me ladies.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.654
Oh, great! l love that song!

20:41.616 --> 20:43.909
Will you turn the radio off, please?

20:45.661 --> 20:46.828
God!

20:47.413 --> 20:49.956
-We could walk to my house from here.
-What?

20:50.374 --> 20:53.209
Yeah, my brother's got a tow truck.
He can come get your car.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.502
l'll go. lt's my fault.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.588
-Forget it. l'm going.
-No, Bill...

20:56.672 --> 20:57.672
You guys just stay here.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.132
There's no sense
in everyone getting drenched.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.675
l completely agree.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.219
Turning to the news.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.804
Local authorities still have no leads

21:04.889 --> 21:08.016
in the mysterious disappearance
of the five cheerleaders from Ruggsville.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.102
The girls were last seen
leaving a cheering competition...

21:11.187 --> 21:13.271
That was loud enough to wake the dead.

21:13.356 --> 21:14.689
-That's an idea.
-What is?

21:14.774 --> 21:16.274
Wouldn't it be dramatic?

21:16.359 --> 21:18.693
Supposing the people inside were dead,

21:18.861 --> 21:22.489
all stretched out
with the lights quietly burning about them.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.658
l'm sure it would be very amusing.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.242
Why, you ask?

21:26.327 --> 21:28.036
Why is not the question.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.537
How?

21:30.414 --> 21:33.041
Well, that is a question worth examining.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.752
How could l,

21:36.212 --> 21:40.173
being born of such conventional stock,

21:40.257 --> 21:42.926
arrive a leader of the rebellion?

21:43.010 --> 21:47.389
An escapist from a conformist world
destined to find happiness

21:47.473 --> 21:49.849
only in that which cannot be explained.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.686
l've brought you here for a reason.

21:52.770 --> 21:56.064
But unfortunately,
you and your sentimental minds

21:56.148 --> 21:57.732
are doing me no good!

21:58.401 --> 22:00.402
My brain is frozen.

22:00.486 --> 22:01.736
Locked!

22:02.780 --> 22:08.535
l have to break free from this culture
of mechanical reproductions

22:08.953 --> 22:12.706
and the thick encrustations
dying on the surface.

22:13.499 --> 22:14.624
Oh, Christ.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.419
Fuck it.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.938
These are all my dolls.

22:37.231 --> 22:38.982
l used to, like, chop their heads off
and their arms

22:39.066 --> 22:40.984
and stick them up on the wall.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.821
The door's locked. l gotta go around.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.240
Just wait here.

23:06.510 --> 23:10.930
Christ! God! Oh, don't do that!
You scared the shit out of me!

23:12.641 --> 23:14.476
You ain't seen nothing yet.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.561
ls your brother ready to go?

23:16.645 --> 23:18.938
Oh, yeah, he already left. Come on inside.

23:19.023 --> 23:20.148
He left?

23:20.608 --> 23:22.484
Yeah! Come in and get toasty.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.658
-Don't worry about it. He's fine.
-l just don't understand why...

23:33.662 --> 23:34.954
What was that?

23:37.458 --> 23:39.334
What? l didn't hear anything.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.795
Turn the radio off.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.463
Now listen.

23:49.595 --> 23:53.515
-l still don't hear anything.
-l swear to God l heard like some weird...

23:54.475 --> 23:57.435
Turn on the headlights.
See if something's out there.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.363
Calm down! Calm down!

24:10.449 --> 24:12.367
Jesus H. Christ.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.869
lt's the fucking tow-truck guy.

24:22.336 --> 24:23.378
We've come to ask for shelter.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.047
We've lost our way.
We're absolutely cut off.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.132
Don't you understand?

24:27.216 --> 24:28.633
We can't go forward, and we can't go back.

24:28.717 --> 24:34.055
So, you live alone here,
l mean, just you and your brother?

24:34.140 --> 24:36.683
Nah, there's a bunch of us
around somewhere.

24:36.767 --> 24:39.811
l think Otis is upstairs
messing around or something.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.740
You gotta have the marshmallows.
That's what makes it fun.

24:54.368 --> 24:55.618
Yeah, l guess.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.413
You sure do a lot of guessing.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.707
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.089
Wow. Look at him.

25:09.091 --> 25:12.552
He must have been going pretty fast
to smash through that wall.

25:15.139 --> 25:18.975
You sure are silly for a guy with glasses.
l like that.

25:19.059 --> 25:22.103
Okay, hey! Need those to see. Thank you.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.439
-All right.
-How do l look?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.942
Terrific, really. Great.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.530
Tasty.

25:33.824 --> 25:36.367
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.133
Okay.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.345
Okay, well. l wonder what time...

25:56.305 --> 25:58.598
-Yeah, it's getting kind of late, huh?
-Don't worry, sugar.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.433
lt ain't past my bedtime.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.353
Hey, are you flirting with me?

26:03.437 --> 26:04.896
What? Oh. No.

26:08.651 --> 26:10.360
Hey, great. They're back.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.279
Whoopee-fucking-do.

26:18.535 --> 26:19.911
Excuse me.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.791
Look, l gotta call my dad
and tell him we're gonna be late.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.793
Can l use your phone, please?

26:27.670 --> 26:30.046
-Hello?
-Ain't got one.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.634
-Oh, hi.
-Oh, my goodness.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.222
You really don't have a phone?

26:41.558 --> 26:42.642
No.

26:45.229 --> 26:48.690
l once had one back in '57, but...

26:52.486 --> 26:53.486
l don't quite remember.

26:53.570 --> 26:58.032
See, there's nobody around here
l feel like jaw-flapping at no more.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.953
Say, do you think
maybe the guy with the tow truck

27:02.037 --> 27:03.454
could drive us to a phone?

27:03.539 --> 27:06.124
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr.,

27:06.750 --> 27:10.962
but we all call him R.J.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.131
Makes sense.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.467
What do they call you, sweetie?

27:17.469 --> 27:19.595
l am Qualznarg of the Crab Nebula.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.476
But you humans can call me Jerry.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.020
Jerry.

27:29.565 --> 27:33.609
Baby, go and see how R.J. is doing
with these nice folks' automobile.

27:35.029 --> 27:38.948
Meanwhile, why don't
you just all make yourselves to home?

27:41.577 --> 27:44.037
Well, what brings you kids way out here?

27:44.121 --> 27:46.998
Haven't you got
something better to do on Halloween

27:47.082 --> 27:48.583
than wander around out in the sticks?

27:48.667 --> 27:51.044
l thought maybe we'd take in a hoedown.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.798
No, he's... He's just joking.

27:57.593 --> 28:00.261
-You are?
-l'm sorry. l'm just messing with you.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.596
l'm sorry.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.514
Shut up, dude.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.059
Oh, l get it.

28:07.811 --> 28:12.190
You all just think you're too good
for the simple pleasures of Halloween.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.693
No, just a little too old.

28:15.944 --> 28:20.615
Oh, really? Well, l hope
something changes your mind someday.

28:22.451 --> 28:23.868
Mama, Tiny's home.

28:24.411 --> 28:25.995
Well, what about R.J.?

28:26.622 --> 28:28.539
He was gone before l seen him.

28:28.624 --> 28:33.086
But Tiny saw him and said he said he was
going down to the yard to get a new wheel.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.546
How long is that gonna take?

28:36.465 --> 28:40.385
-Probably be back in couple hours.
-A couple of hours?

28:40.469 --> 28:41.636
-Mary.
-What?

28:41.970 --> 28:43.971
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?

28:48.685 --> 28:50.728
Oh, Tiny ain't got no car.

28:50.813 --> 28:53.147
He ain't even got a bicycle.

28:53.857 --> 28:58.486
Well, even though l know
that you think it is childish,

28:58.904 --> 29:01.656
tonight is Halloween Eve,

29:02.658 --> 29:05.451
and to us, it is special.

29:07.037 --> 29:10.498
So you are all invited to dinner.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.383
l hope to Christ
she don't expect us to wear these things.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.009
Whatever it is, just do it.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.595
The more we play along,
the faster we get the hell out of here.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.181
Now is not the time to make waves. Jerry.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.702
You'll have to forgive Tiny.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.163
He can't hear so much.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.042
My poor baby.

30:36.919 --> 30:38.586
lt's his daddy's fault.

30:39.296 --> 30:42.632
Oh, l mean, Earl wasn't a bad man.

30:42.716 --> 30:44.550
He never hit me or nothing like that.

30:44.635 --> 30:47.929
One day, he just up
and went devil on us all.

30:48.138 --> 30:49.430
What happened?

30:49.640 --> 30:52.600
Well, he tried to burn down the house.

30:53.143 --> 30:55.186
He said it was possessed by the spirits,

30:55.270 --> 30:59.023
and Tiny was sleeping in
the basement room where the fire started.

31:02.486 --> 31:05.279
But l don't think Earl
ever meant to harm us.

31:06.949 --> 31:08.199
But Tiny was badly burnt.

31:08.283 --> 31:12.245
His ears were destroyed
and most of his skin.

31:12.329 --> 31:15.289
-ls that why he wears the mask?
-Yeah.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.085
My baby boy gets shy around new people.

31:20.587 --> 31:24.799
But he'll warm up to you,
especially the girls.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.805
He's a real lady-killer.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.695
You're gonna miss a good show tonight,
but that's your tough luck.

31:46.363 --> 31:48.990
l thought you kids
were all about team spirit.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.702
l mean, you ain't done fuck-all
to cheer me up since you got here.

31:52.786 --> 31:53.911
Give me a "B."

31:53.996 --> 31:55.037
Give me an "A."

31:55.122 --> 31:56.080
Give me a "B."

31:56.164 --> 31:57.415
Give me a "Y."

31:57.499 --> 32:02.712
What's that spell?

32:04.214 --> 32:05.214
Baby?

32:05.507 --> 32:06.882
You're damn right.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.572
Okay, now. Everybody put on your masks.

32:29.948 --> 32:34.660
We can't very well eat our desserts
with our everyday faces exposed, can we?

32:37.205 --> 32:38.831
Gosh, kid, put it on.

32:40.834 --> 32:43.628
Look, she ain't gonna let
any of us touch dessert

32:43.712 --> 32:46.297
unless you're wearing this damn thing.

32:50.552 --> 32:51.761
Mrs. Firefly?

32:53.055 --> 32:55.640
Do you know anything
about the legend of Dr. Satan?

32:55.724 --> 32:57.475
-Oh, here we go.
-Shut up.

33:00.979 --> 33:05.816
Well, l'm not one for gossip,
l must admit, but l have...

33:05.901 --> 33:08.736
l know all about
what you want to know all about.

33:09.571 --> 33:10.905
Otis.

33:11.823 --> 33:15.618
l can't believe you decided
to come down and join us.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.419
And you brought Little Wolf.

33:26.380 --> 33:27.963
Oh, my baby.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.301
Oh, my God.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.263
Such a special night for me.

33:38.767 --> 33:45.481
Now, l don't know who told you
your fairy fables about Dr. Satan.

33:45.565 --> 33:48.651
We heard it from Captain Spaulding
up the road.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.028
That old bitch-hog don't know shit.

33:51.113 --> 33:54.448
He tells his cute, little tattletales
to sell his junk.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.909
He don't sell no Yankee boys no truth.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.369
Yeah, but, l mean,
something happened, right?

33:58.453 --> 34:00.287
l mean, it had to be based
on some real incident.

34:00.372 --> 34:04.375
What are you, Jimmy Olsen,
cub reporter for The DailyAsshole?

34:04.459 --> 34:08.212
-Grampa, watch your language!
-l don't think you really need to know.

34:08.672 --> 34:13.384
Better you leave here with your head
still full of kitty cats and puppy dogs.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.386
Well, l really would like to know.

34:15.469 --> 34:17.679
Hey, he'd really like to know.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.514
Enlighten him!

34:19.725 --> 34:23.893
Well, l bet you'd stick your head in a fire
if l told you you could see hell.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.438
Meanwhile, you're too stupid to realize

34:26.523 --> 34:29.525
you got a demon
sticking out your ass singing,

34:29.609 --> 34:31.485
"Holy Miss Moley"

34:31.570 --> 34:33.987
-"Got me a live one"
-Got me a live one

34:36.533 --> 34:39.243
Can we change the subject, please?

34:40.786 --> 34:42.163
Dinner's over!

34:43.415 --> 34:45.040
Ladies and germs...

34:46.376 --> 34:48.710
lt's Showtime!

35:00.307 --> 35:01.432
Tell you a little story.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.059
Eat your mom's pussy!

35:05.312 --> 35:07.563
l mean, jam your face in it!

35:07.689 --> 35:08.731
Yes, sir!

35:09.191 --> 35:11.525
And starts licking
and chomping on her pussy,

35:11.610 --> 35:14.361
and she's screaming and yelling,
and she just...

35:15.030 --> 35:18.824
The old battleaxe at home's
liable to crush my balls!

35:20.869 --> 35:22.536
"Would you be quiet?

35:23.413 --> 35:25.664
"You're gonna wake up grandma!"

35:30.712 --> 35:32.296
Bravo, man!

35:32.380 --> 35:34.006
Hey, hey, hey, don't be moving now.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.424
Don't be moving.

35:35.509 --> 35:38.886
We got something real special
for you men out there.

35:56.404 --> 35:57.404
Wow.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.501
-All right.
-Jerry.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.551
Get off him!

37:00.635 --> 37:03.929
l said get the fuck off him,
you stupid, fucking whore!

37:04.806 --> 37:06.056
Fucking slut!

37:06.141 --> 37:07.850
-You shouldn't have done that.
-Oh, really?

37:07.934 --> 37:09.101
Are you gonna do something about it?

37:09.185 --> 37:10.227
l'll do something, motherfucker.

37:10.312 --> 37:11.312
Yeah? Come on!

37:11.396 --> 37:14.023
l'll fucking cut your tits off
and shove them down your throat!

37:14.107 --> 37:15.608
-Baby, stop!
-Oh, come on!

37:15.692 --> 37:18.986
-This bitch has got it coming.
-No, l told you, remember...

37:20.113 --> 37:22.323
-Car's done.
-Thank God.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.409
l suggest that you kids leave.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.578
-We're gone.
-My hat.

37:29.456 --> 37:30.915
-Fuck you!
-Bitch!

37:32.542 --> 37:33.751
l love you, Mama.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.628
l know.

37:42.344 --> 37:44.303
-Open up the fucking doors.
-Hurry up.

37:44.387 --> 37:46.555
Jesus Christ,
you'd think she was really gonna cut you.

37:46.640 --> 37:49.516
Of course she was gonna cut me.
She's a fucking nut!

37:51.561 --> 37:54.313
l knew she was crazy
from the second we fucking picked her up.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.857
Okay. That's that.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.360
Let's get out of this fucking nut house.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.362
Go! Drive! Drive!

38:02.739 --> 38:05.115
Drive! Drive! Drive!

38:05.200 --> 38:06.408
Drive faster!

38:08.078 --> 38:10.037
Go straight! Just go straight!

38:10.997 --> 38:13.582
Shit! What are you doing?
Why are you stopping?

38:13.667 --> 38:16.627
-l gotta open the gate.
-For Christ's sake, hurry up!

38:18.254 --> 38:19.505
Jesus Christ!

38:26.388 --> 38:27.680
Holy shit!

38:28.431 --> 38:30.224
Jerry, wait! Come back!

38:33.436 --> 38:34.520
No!

38:53.081 --> 38:55.666
Shit! What are they doing?

38:55.750 --> 38:57.418
Oh, my... What do we do?

38:57.502 --> 38:59.420
-Shit! Run!
-Who is that?

39:01.089 --> 39:02.339
Oh, my God!

39:04.092 --> 39:05.551
Oh, Jesus!

39:06.136 --> 39:08.178
-Help us somebody!
-Help!

39:08.263 --> 39:09.763
The door! Shut the fucking door!

39:09.848 --> 39:10.931
Oh, no!

39:31.870 --> 39:33.162
Leave us alone!

39:33.371 --> 39:34.747
Somebody help us!

39:35.040 --> 39:36.665
Oh, my... Oh, my God!

39:36.750 --> 39:38.709
Get away from me! No!

39:38.793 --> 39:41.170
No! No!

39:42.881 --> 39:44.048
No, please!

39:44.799 --> 39:45.966
Oh, my God!

39:46.342 --> 39:47.342
No! No!

39:47.844 --> 39:48.844
Oh, my God!

39:48.928 --> 39:49.928
No!

39:50.764 --> 39:54.058
Get me out... Help me! Help me!

39:54.142 --> 39:55.142
Help!

39:55.894 --> 39:57.144
Help me!

40:26.091 --> 40:29.593
Rock 'n' roll this morning
with some Led Zeppelin...

40:29.677 --> 40:32.137
Yeah, it's kind of wild
around the radio station today,

40:32.222 --> 40:33.639
it being a holiday.

40:33.723 --> 40:36.016
lt's kind of like a ghost town around here.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.894
lt's kind of nice, though.
lt's kind of kick-back.

40:39.354 --> 40:41.480
Maybe time to get away with stuff.

40:49.531 --> 40:50.531
Huston.

40:50.698 --> 40:51.949
Donald Willis.

40:54.202 --> 40:56.245
Don Willis, how the hell are you?

40:56.329 --> 40:58.705
Listen, Frank,
l'm a little worried about Denise.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.792
She called me last night
from the road near Ruggsville,

41:01.876 --> 41:03.919
a place called Spaulding's.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.588
Yeah, l know of the joint.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.967
She said she'd be here about 1 1 :00
but she never showed up.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.220
Well, l'll run a check
on up there by Spaulding's

41:13.304 --> 41:16.014
and see if there's any accidents
or road closings.

41:16.099 --> 41:19.059
lt was raining
like a son of a bitch here last night.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.395
They're probably just
stuck in the mud someplace.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.251
Shut your mouth!

41:45.545 --> 41:48.255
l said shut your fucking mouth!

41:52.969 --> 41:56.346
Listen, you Malibu
middle-class Barbie piece of shit,

41:56.431 --> 41:58.015
l'm trying to work here.

41:58.099 --> 42:00.058
Work? You ever work?

42:00.768 --> 42:02.352
Yeah, l'll bet you have.

42:02.437 --> 42:05.772
Scooping ice cream
to your shit-heel friends on summer break.

42:06.149 --> 42:08.984
Well, l ain't talking about
no goddamn white socks

42:09.068 --> 42:12.321
with Mickey Mouse on one side
and Donald Duck on the other.

42:12.614 --> 42:14.698
l ain't reading no funny books, mama.

42:14.782 --> 42:18.243
Our bodies come and go,
but this blood is forever.

42:19.871 --> 42:20.871
Now...

42:21.539 --> 42:26.919
l'm gonna remove your gag,
but if you make so much as a fucking peep,

42:27.003 --> 42:28.545
l'm gonna cut you like a pig

42:28.630 --> 42:31.798
and make you eat
your own fucking intestines, you got me?

42:42.644 --> 42:45.896
Why are you...
Why are you doing this to me?

42:45.980 --> 42:47.731
Why are you doing this?

42:48.191 --> 42:49.316
Doing what?

42:49.859 --> 42:52.653
-Messing up your day?
-Where's Bill?

42:54.280 --> 42:55.489
Where's Bill?

42:55.615 --> 42:56.657
Bill?

42:57.367 --> 42:59.785
-ls he okay?
-He's a good guy.

43:01.621 --> 43:04.456
He's been a great help to me,
a real blessing.

43:05.208 --> 43:08.126
l mean, l couldn't
have asked for a better specimen.

43:10.171 --> 43:14.049
You don't know
what kind of dry spell l've had here.

43:14.133 --> 43:16.218
Total block, total block.

43:18.096 --> 43:19.179
But Bill?

43:20.807 --> 43:21.890
He's okay.

43:23.977 --> 43:25.143
Where is he?

44:16.738 --> 44:19.990
This is gonna hurt you a lot more
than it's gonna hurt me.

44:29.250 --> 44:31.043
Where is he? Can l see him?

44:31.127 --> 44:33.754
Can l see Bill, please?

44:34.047 --> 44:35.255
Let's go see.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.135
Behold!

44:41.763 --> 44:43.930
-Fishboy!
-Oh, my God!

44:44.599 --> 44:46.516
Oh, my God, Bill!

44:46.601 --> 44:49.936
No! No! This can't be real!
This can't be real! This can't be real.

44:50.021 --> 44:52.022
This can't be real. This can't be real.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.273
Oh, it's real.

44:54.275 --> 44:56.234
Real as l want it to be, mama.

45:07.288 --> 45:09.790
Fuck you, you fucking freak!

45:30.895 --> 45:31.895
Well...

45:31.979 --> 45:34.731
Let's see if the nut
that runs this place can help us.

45:37.235 --> 45:39.152
Take a look at all this crap?

45:40.029 --> 45:43.031
Red-flag anybody who runs a joint like this.

45:44.659 --> 45:46.493
Sweet baby Jesus.

45:46.953 --> 45:49.955
Whoever's jerking off on that bell out there
better be gone when l come out,

45:50.039 --> 45:52.040
or l'm gonna rip your nuts off!

45:54.502 --> 45:57.170
Officers, Officers, what can l do for you?

45:57.964 --> 45:59.256
l ain't fired up the bird yet

45:59.340 --> 46:01.049
if that's what you've been
ring-a-ding-dinging about.

46:01.134 --> 46:04.428
l need you to answer
some questions about some missing kids.

46:04.637 --> 46:06.346
l don't know nothing about nothing.

46:06.431 --> 46:09.141
You see, l'm the kind of guy
just minds his own business,

46:09.225 --> 46:10.434
if you get what l'm saying.

46:10.518 --> 46:13.186
You seen this girl,
say, in the last 24 hours?

46:15.356 --> 46:17.065
Yeah, yeah, cute kid.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.818
Ain't my type, though.

46:20.027 --> 46:22.821
You know, l like them with
a little more meat on them.

46:22.905 --> 46:25.657
The bigger the cushion,
the sweeter the pushing.

46:29.162 --> 46:31.288
Hey, look, clown ass,
just answer the damn question.

46:31.372 --> 46:33.206
We ain't interested
in your love life, all right?

46:33.291 --> 46:36.084
Cut the crap, Spaulding,
and just get with the facts.

46:36.169 --> 46:38.295
-Huh?
-What did you see?

46:38.796 --> 46:41.214
Who was she with? Where was she going?

46:41.299 --> 46:43.550
l don't know.
She was with some stupid kids.

46:43.634 --> 46:46.761
They was nosing around,
asking a bunch of stupid questions.

46:46.846 --> 46:48.221
Questions about what?

46:48.306 --> 46:49.973
l don't know. This and that.

46:50.057 --> 46:53.143
Mostly a bunch of tired Dr. Satan bullshit.

46:54.729 --> 46:56.730
They caught a gander
at the display in the back,

46:56.814 --> 46:58.356
and they figured they was gonna run out

46:58.441 --> 47:00.567
and solve the great Deadwood mystery.

47:00.651 --> 47:02.444
And how'd they get that idea?

47:02.528 --> 47:03.987
l wrote them a map.

47:04.739 --> 47:06.823
Well, out to the old farm road, you know?

47:06.908 --> 47:08.950
l figured, what the hell?
lt wouldn't do no harm.

47:09.035 --> 47:11.620
Besides, it's good for my tourist trade.

47:13.122 --> 47:15.749
You can shit 1 0 bricks for all l care.

47:16.918 --> 47:18.001
What else?

47:19.253 --> 47:20.253
Nothing.

47:21.214 --> 47:25.217
Stupid-ass kids probably got themselves
turned around ass-backwards

47:25.301 --> 47:27.344
and got theyself lost.

47:27.428 --> 47:28.595
ls that all?

47:28.888 --> 47:31.097
And l want you to think real hard.

47:36.145 --> 47:38.230
Well, l don't rightly know.

47:38.606 --> 47:40.273
See, they wasn't here long enough

47:40.358 --> 47:42.817
for me to get up close
and personal with them,

47:42.902 --> 47:46.029
like l do most the assholes
that come wandering in here.

47:46.113 --> 47:49.658
How about you write them
same damn directions out for me, then?

47:49.742 --> 47:52.827
All right, all right!
Don't get all True Grit on my ass.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.413
You can knock yourself silly for all l care.

47:55.498 --> 47:56.665
Enough talk!

47:56.916 --> 47:57.958
Write.

48:01.462 --> 48:03.964
l don't know where that Skunk Ape sleeps.

48:04.048 --> 48:07.592
All l know is
he had impure relations with my wife.

48:09.178 --> 48:10.262
That's true.

48:10.346 --> 48:13.473
He performed lurid acts
upon me and my person.

48:13.558 --> 48:15.058
Hold up the picture.

48:15.893 --> 48:17.811
l'm gonna kill that Skunk Ape.

50:08.464 --> 50:11.633
Please, Tiny. Please let me go.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.844
Let me go. Help me.

50:15.471 --> 50:17.847
Please. God, please.

50:20.351 --> 50:27.774
Thank you.

50:29.110 --> 50:32.028
l'm just gonna go now. l'm just gonna go.

50:34.490 --> 50:40.328
l'm just gonna go home now.

50:43.916 --> 50:45.458
l'm just gonna go now.

50:47.962 --> 50:49.754
l'm just going home now.

50:51.465 --> 50:53.216
Where the fuck
do you think you're getting to?

50:53.300 --> 50:54.384
No, no, no!

50:54.468 --> 50:55.719
No, no.

50:55.803 --> 50:58.054
No! No! No!

50:58.305 --> 50:59.305
No.

51:01.809 --> 51:03.935
Playtime is over.

51:18.951 --> 51:21.202
Suspect seen in...

51:27.209 --> 51:28.334
lt matches.

51:29.628 --> 51:30.754
Call it in.

51:31.714 --> 51:33.923
-l think we found them.
-Yeah.

51:47.688 --> 51:49.856
Hey, poopy pants. What's new?

51:49.940 --> 51:52.442
Where the fuck is Bill? Where's Denise?
You can't keep us here!

51:52.526 --> 51:53.777
Shut up!

51:55.571 --> 51:57.781
Hey, you wanna play a guessing game?

51:59.700 --> 52:01.868
Guess what number l'm thinking of.

52:02.787 --> 52:04.537
Eat shit and die.

52:08.626 --> 52:10.084
No, wait! Please! Come on, stop it!

52:10.169 --> 52:11.669
What do you want?
What do you want from me?

52:11.754 --> 52:14.047
Please be quiet. l don't want to slip.

52:18.385 --> 52:20.345
Okay, one more.

52:20.888 --> 52:23.056
You get this right, l'll let you go.

52:23.557 --> 52:25.892
lf you get it wrong, you are fucked!

52:27.436 --> 52:29.604
Okay, who's my favorite movie star?

52:30.856 --> 52:32.065
l don't know.

52:32.608 --> 52:34.150
Marilyn Monroe.

52:35.986 --> 52:38.863
No. Bette Davis. Sorry! You lose!

52:45.621 --> 52:47.997
Jesus, somebody sure
had themselves a field day

52:48.082 --> 52:49.999
beating the shit out of this thing,
didn't they?

52:50.084 --> 52:51.084
Yeah.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.087
No mercy shown here.

52:55.047 --> 52:57.090
Didn't find any bodies, did you?

52:57.800 --> 53:00.176
-Not yet.
-Holy Christ.

53:01.887 --> 53:05.181
What could these kids have possibly done
to bring this much hell down on them?

53:05.266 --> 53:07.475
-Hey, l found something.
-What's that?

53:07.560 --> 53:08.601
Keys.

53:08.686 --> 53:10.728
Well, don't just stand there
like some prize dog dick.

53:10.813 --> 53:12.146
-Open the trunk.
-Yes, sir.

53:12.231 --> 53:13.523
Toss them here.

53:18.404 --> 53:20.029
Oh, goddamn.

53:20.114 --> 53:21.739
Got something, Georgie?

53:21.907 --> 53:24.284
Yeah. We found something.

53:24.910 --> 53:26.703
People come, people go,

53:27.288 --> 53:31.332
but how many ever really stop to
take a look at the underbelly of the beast?

53:32.251 --> 53:35.128
l make them stop, and l make them look.

53:35.462 --> 53:37.630
Hope you like what you see.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.508
Hope you like what you see!

53:40.593 --> 53:42.927
Just hold it a minute, Grandpa.

53:44.138 --> 53:46.681
At a time like this you're taking pictures?

53:48.017 --> 53:51.811
l just couldn't help it.
You look so natural sitting in that car.

53:51.896 --> 53:55.440
Put me behind the wheel of that bitch!
l'll show you driving!

53:56.650 --> 53:58.234
You useless fuck.

53:58.319 --> 54:00.862
You couldn't even get
your big ass in that seat.

54:00.946 --> 54:02.822
Why, you ungrateful...

54:03.657 --> 54:05.950
Don't start with me, Hugo.

54:11.749 --> 54:14.667
Hey, get off the damn car.
This ain't your living room.

54:14.752 --> 54:16.544
Goddamn grease monkey.

54:19.673 --> 54:22.675
Sure this guy's supposed to ride with us
in this car?

54:26.347 --> 54:28.222
Just doesn't seem right to me.

54:28.307 --> 54:29.349
Well, it ain't up to us.

54:29.433 --> 54:32.143
Chief said to pick him up
and take him with us.

54:32.311 --> 54:34.729
Guy's an ex-cop.
Figures he can be of some help.

54:34.813 --> 54:37.857
l just hope he doesn't get in my way
is all l'm saying.

54:45.157 --> 54:46.532
This must be him.

54:49.370 --> 54:51.162
-Mr. Willis?
-Yes, sir.

54:51.705 --> 54:54.082
-l'm Wydell. This here is Naish.
-How you doing, sir?

54:54.166 --> 54:55.416
Donald Willis.

54:55.918 --> 54:57.043
Any leads?

54:57.544 --> 54:59.754
Well, we were on our way out
to check on a couple of farms

54:59.838 --> 55:01.172
out on the edge of town.

55:01.256 --> 55:03.549
That's about our only lead up to this point.

55:03.634 --> 55:05.635
What about this body you found?

55:05.970 --> 55:07.470
You know about that?

55:07.638 --> 55:09.389
Local girl, Karen Murphy,

55:09.848 --> 55:12.225
one of the cheerleaders
who went missing last week.

55:12.309 --> 55:13.309
That's it?

55:13.394 --> 55:15.061
Well, we know the kids
were on their way out

55:15.145 --> 55:17.105
to a place the locals call Deadwood.

55:17.189 --> 55:21.734
Yeah, they want to play Nancy Drew with
this local legend that people call Dr. Satan.

55:21.944 --> 55:24.570
-This is insane.
-Don't you worry about it.

55:24.655 --> 55:25.905
We'll find her, all right?

55:29.952 --> 55:34.163
My name is Lewis Dover,
and l know this man,

55:34.248 --> 55:36.207
but l know the truth!

55:36.291 --> 55:41.004
You don't have to go to hell.
You already there! This is hell!

55:41.088 --> 55:43.548
This is hell! This is hell!

56:21.795 --> 56:23.046
l'm gonna see if anybody's home.

56:23.130 --> 56:26.966
You and Mr. Willis check around
and see if you see anything.

56:27.801 --> 56:29.010
Come with me.

56:37.478 --> 56:39.437
l hate fucked up families!

56:40.731 --> 56:41.981
Just a dip.

56:42.066 --> 56:43.608
Otis! Otis, come quick!

56:43.692 --> 56:45.318
There's cops out there.

56:45.569 --> 56:47.612
Goddamn! How many?

56:47.696 --> 56:49.155
Hey, don't worry about it.

56:49.239 --> 56:50.990
l don't know. l only saw one.

56:51.075 --> 56:53.618
Hell, fucking pigs always travel in packs.

56:53.702 --> 56:55.536
-Take this.
-Okay, Daddy.

56:55.621 --> 56:57.830
Go downstairs and play nice.

56:59.166 --> 57:03.503
l'll go around back and take control,
like l always fucking do!

57:06.215 --> 57:07.298
Goddamn.

57:08.509 --> 57:10.718
These pack rats throw anything away?

57:11.178 --> 57:12.595
l don't think so.

57:12.679 --> 57:14.347
Hold this right here.

57:14.723 --> 57:15.723
Hello!

57:17.351 --> 57:18.518
Hello.

57:23.357 --> 57:25.942
You'd think these sons of bitches
would have a yard sale, don't you?

57:26.026 --> 57:27.026
Yeah.

57:29.488 --> 57:30.488
Hello?

57:33.784 --> 57:34.867
lt's a dog!

57:34.952 --> 57:37.036
Calm down, Barney.

57:37.121 --> 57:39.580
-Don't you start in with that Mayberry shit.
-He's only a dog.

57:39.665 --> 57:41.707
l was bitten by a cocker spaniel
when l was 8 years old.

57:44.169 --> 57:46.379
-Well, hello, Officer.
-Afternoon, ma'am.

57:46.463 --> 57:48.965
l'm Lieutenant Wydell.
l'd like to ask you a few questions.

57:49.049 --> 57:53.177
Why, heck.
l'll just tell you anything you want to know.

57:53.262 --> 57:55.096
Appreciate the cooperation, ma'am.

57:55.180 --> 57:56.556
l'm looking for a missing girl.

57:56.640 --> 57:59.851
l'm serious.
lt was big cocker spaniel, big teeth.

57:59.935 --> 58:02.520
lt was my ex-girlfriend's.
Almost bit off my pinky toe.

58:02.604 --> 58:03.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:05.023 --> 58:06.274
You hear that?

58:06.441 --> 58:09.735
Yeah. Yeah, l hear it.
Where do you think it's coming from?

58:09.903 --> 58:11.154
Out this way.

58:12.531 --> 58:15.283
All right, hold on.
Hold on one second here. Hold on.

58:15.367 --> 58:18.578
Hey! Hey! Sheriff's department.
Open up. Hey!

58:18.787 --> 58:20.454
No, l ain't seen her. Sorry.

58:20.539 --> 58:24.000
Ma'am, if l could just come in for a minute.

58:24.084 --> 58:26.460
l have some other pictures
l'd like you to look at.

58:26.545 --> 58:28.254
Might stir something up.

58:29.256 --> 58:30.923
No. l don't think so.

58:31.216 --> 58:34.010
Ma'am...it'll only take a minute.

58:38.724 --> 58:40.099
All right.

58:41.727 --> 58:46.147
l guess l can trust you,
being a man of the law and all.

58:46.231 --> 58:47.356
Yes, ma'am.

58:49.109 --> 58:50.443
Thank you, ma'am.

59:19.598 --> 59:22.225
This one looks familiar.
Now, is he on the TV?

59:22.351 --> 59:24.477
No, ma'am, l don't believe he is.

59:28.273 --> 59:29.607
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Wydell!

59:29.691 --> 59:32.568
-Wydell! Over! Wydell. Over.
-Wydell. Over.

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:07.556
Let me take a guess here.
Y'all having a Halloween party tonight.

01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:10.267
Now, what makes you think that, big boy?

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:13.729
Well, you sure are buying
a whole mess of holy water for two people.

01:02:13.814 --> 01:02:15.314
Yeah, we like to get fucked up

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:17.441
and do fucked-up shit,
you know what l mean?

01:02:17.526 --> 01:02:21.362
Yeah, l like to get fucked up, too,
and do some fucked-up shit.

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:22.905
Yeah, l bet you do.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:25.157
How much we owe you, Goober?

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.745
Actually, it's G. Ober, for Gerry Ober.

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:34.625
But the new guy Ronald, in the back,
he drew in that other "o" and made Goober.

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:35.835
Fucking asshole.

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:38.462
Great story, Goober.
How much we owe you?

01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:42.716
Well, the damage is quite severe. $1 85.

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:45.094
That ain't gonna break my bank, honey.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:49.098
Here. Keep the change
and go get yourself a new name, Goober.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:52.935
Holy dog! l will! Thank you! Y'all drive safe.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:55.896
Thanks for coming in
to Red Hot Pussy Liquors.

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:26.302
Where's Otis? Where's Otis?

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:29.054
He's coming.
He got something real special this year.

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:47.907
Otis! Otis! Otis!

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:50.075
Otis! Otis!

01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:06.300
l'm the one who brings
the Christmas candy.

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:09.053
Now tell me...

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:10.930
Who's your daddy?

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:17.895
l'm the one who brings the devil's brandy.

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:19.939
Who's your daddy?

01:04:24.236 --> 01:04:26.695
l'm the one who beats you
when you're bad.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:30.241
Who's your daddy?

01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:39.041
Come on, sweetie.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:41.293
Give the old man some sugar.

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:45.381
Daddy?

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:47.174
Daddy.

01:04:50.262 --> 01:04:54.306
And l'm the one who loves you
when you're fucking dead!

01:04:54.975 --> 01:04:57.142
Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:01.480
Shame on you, little darlings.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:04.525
Maybe it just ain't a good idea

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:07.152
to be prancing around
where you don't belong.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:08.404
And you.

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:11.156
The grave rustler of fools.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:12.992
What was it you were after?

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:14.827
Come on. Speak to me, boy.

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:18.581
Oh, l remember now. Dr. Satan.

01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:21.584
God damn it,
everybody got to know about Dr. Satan.

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:24.211
You know what l'm gonna do, boy?
l'm gonna do you a favor.

01:05:24.296 --> 01:05:26.672
l'm gonna let you meet the old bastard.

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:29.883
lt's all true.

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:34.096
The bogeyman is real and you found him.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.515
And you found him...

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:41.246
Hey, happy boy, step your ass up here.

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:45.751
Take his gag out.
lt's more fun with the screaming.

01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:50.005
l like that, too, that screaming.
lt's so much more exciting that way.

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:55.511
Please don't kill us. Please don't kill us.

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:58.347
Please don't kill us.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:01.016
Shut your mouth
and get your shit in the box.

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:04.687
Get in now.

01:07:05.397 --> 01:07:07.022
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:08.941
l wanna say good-bye.

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.120
Good-bye, sweetie.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:23.455
We could have been great.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:24.707
Look, look, look, just let us go.

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:26.667
l swear to God, we won't tell anyone.
l swear.

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:29.586
Honey, now, you know l can't do that.

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:34.508
"l swear to God we won't tell anyone.
l swear to God."

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:36.135
Ain't we just having a fucking hoot?

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:38.011
Get your fucking ass up, boy.

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:40.931
All right, come on.
Get in the box, and he's gone.

01:07:41.433 --> 01:07:44.101
Now, where does she think
she's gonna run to?

01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:45.769
What, is she gonna run all the way home?

01:07:45.854 --> 01:07:49.189
-No! Let me get her.
-Oh, all right. Go get her.

01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:53.193
Hunting humans...

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:55.487
Ain't nothing but nothing.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:58.991
They all run like scared little rabbits.

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:02.786
Run, rabbit, run.

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:05.539
Run, rabbit!

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:09.001
Run, rabbit! Run, rabbit!

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:12.004
Run, rabbit, run!

01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:14.840
Run, rabbit!

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:21.930
There once was a woman

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:24.725
who lived with her daughter
in a cabbage garden.

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:28.729
Along came a rabbit
and ate up all the cabbages.

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:32.649
The woman said, "Go into the garden
and drive out the rabbit."

01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:37.696
Mary, l'm gonna get you!
l'm gonna get you!

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:42.075
Mary! Mary!

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:45.203
l'm gonna get you! l'm gonna get you!

01:08:49.584 --> 01:08:50.917
l got you!

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.279
"Shoo, shoo," said the maiden.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:27.162
"Come, maiden," said the rabbit,

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:30.582
"sit on my tail
and go with me to my rabbit hutch."

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:41.844
No! No!

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:44.595
-No!
-No hanky-panky.

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:46.305
Rufus, put the lid on.

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:52.604
No!

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:57.067
Oh, God!

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:03.782
Oh, no!

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:15.460
No! No!

01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:17.880
No, no.

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:20.966
Stop! No!

01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:44.156
No!

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:48.493
Stop! No!

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.115
No!

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:32.204
Jerry, wake up. Wake...

01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:36.333
Jerry, wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:06.905
Oh, my God!

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:20.752
Jerry!

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.505
Oh, God! Jerry!

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:48.905

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:51.616

01:12:53.161 --> 01:12:54.703

01:12:58.291 --> 01:12:59.833

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.466

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:10.052
Oh, thank... Thank God.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:27.527
Please help me.

01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:58.655
...his terrifying experiments.

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:01.449
Do you know anything
about the legend of Dr. Satan?

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:02.534
Jerry?

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:07.539
No. No. No.

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:25.849
No!

01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:30.312
No! No, no, no, no.

01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:32.188

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:36.609

01:23:39.598 --> 01:23:42.684

Yeah, l recognize you.

01:23:50.109 --> 01:23:52.944
