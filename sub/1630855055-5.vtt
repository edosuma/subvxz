WEBVTT

00:49.750 --> 00:52.916
I just received confirmation.
The boys are back in Camp des Milles.

00:52.916 --> 00:53.958
Are they okay?

00:53.958 --> 00:55.208
They're alive.

00:55.208 --> 00:56.750
Well, that's a relief.

00:56.750 --> 00:59.250
You do understand that if they talk,
they'll talk about you.

01:01.458 --> 01:04.416
- No. No, they wouldn't talk about me.
If you're lucky.

01:05.208 --> 01:07.375
If Vichy learns of your involvement
from them,

01:07.875 --> 01:10.041
we will not be able to protect you.

01:10.041 --> 01:13.125
If pressed, we will deny
any knowledge of your activities.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.375
How? I live with Thomas.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.250
The Villa Air-Bel is a big house.

01:17.250 --> 01:19.958
How should he know
what any of his tenants do all day?

01:20.458 --> 01:21.500
Thomas.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.166
Thomas!

01:26.875 --> 01:28.125
Look, it's not up to me.

01:29.458 --> 01:31.083
We're all following orders.

01:34.291 --> 01:35.333
Who are you?

01:36.166 --> 01:37.541
Now you're asking me questions?

01:37.541 --> 01:40.541
Who are you? Where do you go
when you leave these meetings?

01:40.541 --> 01:43.750
What about you?
Is Lovegrove even a real name?

01:43.750 --> 01:44.708
Don't.

01:44.708 --> 01:48.875
No! You two can pretend
like you don't know anything about me,

01:48.875 --> 01:53.083
but I am an open book!
It's me that knows nothing about you!

01:53.083 --> 01:55.916
This war is bigger than any one of us,
Mary Jayne.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.875
The Nazis are flattening Manchester.

01:57.875 --> 02:00.041
We need to get those men out
before Christmas.

02:00.541 --> 02:01.916
You must make that happen.

02:01.916 --> 02:03.083
On my own?

02:03.083 --> 02:04.041
Margaux.

02:04.833 --> 02:05.875
I'll go with her.

02:07.166 --> 02:09.000
Let her go on her own.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.583
Oh, because I'm dispensable.

02:10.583 --> 02:14.375
- Because it's your fault they're in there.
- So why should I do this for you?

02:14.375 --> 02:15.750
Because if you don't,

02:15.750 --> 02:19.291
we will withdraw our financial support
from the Emergency Rescue Committee.

02:58.708 --> 03:00.083
Good morning.

03:01.041 --> 03:02.666
What's wrong with me?

03:03.458 --> 03:04.833
Absolutely nothing.

03:07.416 --> 03:08.833
I'm sleeping too well.

03:10.916 --> 03:12.083
That is a good thing.

03:12.833 --> 03:15.625
Everyone at the villa is
waiting to get out of here.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.291
Every day, they ask me when.

03:18.833 --> 03:21.291
Have your nosy roommates figured out
what we are doing?

03:21.958 --> 03:22.958
Does it matter?

03:23.833 --> 03:25.625
It would to some people.

03:25.625 --> 03:28.416
Well, we don't care about those people,
do we?

03:31.041 --> 03:32.666
- We don't care.
- We don't.

03:55.291 --> 03:58.083
<i>Hannah Arendt is always up
at the crack of dawn.</i>

03:59.666 --> 04:02.458
We were in the internment camp
at Gurs together

04:03.625 --> 04:05.500
when the Germans invaded Paris.

04:06.666 --> 04:08.416
It was complete chaos.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.875
The French guards abandoned their posts
and left the gates wide open.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.750
But I couldn't leave.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.416
I was

04:23.416 --> 04:24.625
paralyzed with fear.

04:28.166 --> 04:29.208
Hannah...

04:30.291 --> 04:32.583
Hannah just stood up and walked out,

04:32.583 --> 04:34.875
like it was
the simplest thing in the world.

04:36.708 --> 04:38.583
She gave me the courage to leave too.

04:40.791 --> 04:44.375
If only I could return the favor now
and get her out of here.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.166
Good morning.

05:06.333 --> 05:07.791
Sorry, Ms. Arendt.

05:09.916 --> 05:12.208
Oh, no, just your... mm...

05:13.041 --> 05:14.250
language.

05:14.250 --> 05:16.541
Sorry. My English...

05:16.541 --> 05:17.958
You know, actually...

05:20.666 --> 05:24.208
I learned a bit of German in Berlin.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.208
Oh.

05:26.208 --> 05:27.541
What are you doing there?

05:29.833 --> 05:33.541
Translating my friend
Walter Benjamin's work into English,

05:33.541 --> 05:36.458
It's a good way to teach myself English.

05:36.458 --> 05:40.125
America will be indebted to you.

05:40.125 --> 05:44.083
Then please tell America
to give me a visa.

05:46.541 --> 05:50.458
Unfortunately, I can't help you with that.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.541
Because I am not on your list?

06:12.541 --> 06:14.541
Varian.
I'm in a hurry.

06:16.125 --> 06:19.583
We should celebrate Christmas here.
Raise people's spirits.

06:20.416 --> 06:21.333
What do you think?

06:21.833 --> 06:24.916
- We could decorate that tree.
- I thought Jews didn't celebrate.

06:24.916 --> 06:27.250
We're in Europe.
Everybody celebrates Christmas.

06:29.416 --> 06:32.750
Varian! Please, talk to me.

06:35.416 --> 06:36.250
No.

06:48.541 --> 06:51.041
Okay.
Okay, I'll leave it.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.625
Some quiet?
Okay.

06:52.625 --> 06:54.000
- Easy.
Yes.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.375
No worries.
- Silence is nice.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.791
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Um...

07:02.125 --> 07:04.041
I need to speak with you.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.375
I was just leaving.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.583
You too, as well, please.

07:10.958 --> 07:11.791
Have a seat.

07:28.458 --> 07:33.458
I need to break the British POWs out
of the prison camp.

07:33.458 --> 07:36.541
Of course you do.
Please.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.041
Even if this were possible,
how do you know they're in there?

07:42.041 --> 07:46.375
Well, me, I know nothing,
but I trust my source.

07:46.375 --> 07:49.916
- This is a British intelligence officer?
- Special operations executive.

07:49.916 --> 07:51.500
She goes by the name of Margaux.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
- And Lovegrove?
- He works for her.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.458
Ah, I knew it.

07:57.041 --> 07:57.958
I want to meet her.

07:57.958 --> 08:00.791
You help me with this,
and I will arrange the introduction.

08:01.750 --> 08:02.666
Please?

08:02.666 --> 08:04.375
I cannot do this on my own.

08:07.125 --> 08:10.041
We can't just head in there
without knowing how to get out.

08:10.041 --> 08:11.625
Bellmer was inside.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.041
The artist?

08:13.041 --> 08:16.500
He's at the villa.
- That's right. I could talk to him. Yes.

08:20.875 --> 08:21.916
Please.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.625
I will need to check out
the perimeter of the prison yard.

08:31.875 --> 08:33.750
- Good morning.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.500
Morning.

08:36.666 --> 08:39.416
Morning.
We'll be with you as soon as we can.

08:40.541 --> 08:41.958
- Good morning.
- Morning.

08:41.958 --> 08:43.791
I was thinking.
- Varian--

08:43.791 --> 08:47.458
We should rework the interview to account
for all possible paths to entry.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.750
Some people might be able
to get into the United States

08:49.750 --> 08:51.416
as a student, for example.

08:52.541 --> 08:54.666
Good morning.
Are you here for an interview?

08:54.666 --> 08:58.375
I'm Dillon Reese, Mr. Fry.
I'm from the American consulate.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.541
- I'm sorry?
- I was trying to tell you.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.333
- I'm your replacement.
- My replacement?

09:03.833 --> 09:06.500
You've been fired, but you know that.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.208
- Don't be ridiculous!
- I wanted to give you this.

09:22.958 --> 09:27.208
- Twenty-four hours to leave the country?
- It's all clearly explained in the letter.

09:27.208 --> 09:30.833
Your French work visa was terminated
with your employment.

09:32.541 --> 09:36.625
Don't you worry. I'm gonna keep this place
running like a Swiss clock.

09:39.125 --> 09:41.916
- Have you called Bingham?
- Yes, he was completely in the dark.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.916
- Varian, you can't let this happen.
- I won't. I'm gonna fight this until--

09:45.916 --> 09:47.666
Simmer down.

09:49.208 --> 09:50.500
What did you just say to me?

09:50.500 --> 09:53.875
We're all adults here, Mr. Fry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.791
- Please don't tell anyone about this.
- Mm-hmm.

10:07.375 --> 10:08.208
I will be back.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.250
Have a pleasant day.

10:17.166 --> 10:18.125
I'm very sorry.

10:19.291 --> 10:20.416
I'll be back.

10:20.916 --> 10:22.958
I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry.

10:27.541 --> 10:28.791
I have to see him.

10:28.791 --> 10:30.000
But--
- Now!

10:30.000 --> 10:31.291
Uh... N...

10:33.000 --> 10:33.916
Next Wednesday.

10:33.916 --> 10:36.500
Next Wednesday? No, that is much too late.

10:41.833 --> 10:42.958
What a pity!

11:07.750 --> 11:08.750
Patterson?

11:10.541 --> 11:11.375
Patterson!

11:12.958 --> 11:14.166
You can't do this.

11:14.166 --> 11:17.291
Please, Mr. Fry,
you give me far too much credit.

11:17.291 --> 11:20.250
I'm just a bureaucrat
following orders from on high.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.000
What did you say to them?

11:23.541 --> 11:24.958
About you?
- Yes!

11:27.125 --> 11:28.166
Only the truth.

12:09.833 --> 12:11.083
Mr. Bellmer?

12:13.916 --> 12:14.791
Uh...

12:14.791 --> 12:16.958
May I ask you an, um...

12:17.833 --> 12:19.583
an unusual question?

12:23.125 --> 12:26.333
Do you remember anything
about the inside of Camp des Milles?

12:42.333 --> 12:45.250
I remember <i>everything</i>
about Camp des Milles.

12:46.375 --> 12:50.166
I will never forget one inch
of that place for as long as I live.

12:53.250 --> 12:57.000
The feeling of other people
pressed up against me day and night.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.750
Their warm, wet bodies.

13:01.458 --> 13:03.208
The stench of humanity.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.958
Do you think that you could build me

13:10.958 --> 13:13.458
a model of the inside of the camp

13:13.958 --> 13:16.250
and the outside of the camp?

13:18.541 --> 13:19.625
Why?

13:19.625 --> 13:22.000
Because I wanna help other men escape.

13:24.333 --> 13:25.333
Then of course.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.875
You can meet here
any time you like. It's safe here.

14:54.166 --> 14:55.166
Thank you.

15:15.333 --> 15:16.291
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

15:17.708 --> 15:19.708
We are playing the long game here.

15:20.291 --> 15:22.541
Once we've driven
the Germans out of France,

15:23.375 --> 15:25.208
we will drive the French out of Africa!

15:25.708 --> 15:27.791
So why is
a white man joining our conversation?

15:28.791 --> 15:30.000
Um...

15:31.083 --> 15:32.125
I'm a Jew.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.750
You're still white.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.666
Albert has as much at stake here
as any of us do.

15:38.958 --> 15:40.000
Gentlemen.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.166
Gentlemen.

15:43.416 --> 15:44.791
We need allies.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.416
We also need weapons.

15:47.416 --> 15:49.166
Training. Intelligence.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.166
Where from?

15:53.750 --> 15:55.000
To start? From the British.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.083
The British?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.208
They have
the largest colonial empire in the world!

16:02.208 --> 16:05.083
But right here, right now,
they share our goals.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.458
If we break their POWs out tomorrow,

16:08.958 --> 16:11.083
we'll cement the collaboration
going forward.

16:15.625 --> 16:16.625
Who's in?

16:36.250 --> 16:39.833
Here's the list of current inmates.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.833
The men you're looking for are on it.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.916
I can tip them off
so they know you're coming.

16:45.916 --> 16:48.500
But you must be prepared to move quickly.

16:51.166 --> 16:52.916
We protect the perimeter of the camp.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.958
We shoot to kill. That's the job.

17:00.875 --> 17:02.916
Realistically, we can
only hold our fire for, what,

17:05.500 --> 17:07.250
maybe 60 seconds maximum?

17:10.166 --> 17:13.333
If the French guards think
that we're allowing prisoners to escape,

17:14.250 --> 17:15.250
believe me,

17:16.416 --> 17:17.583
they'll shoot us.

17:23.250 --> 17:28.083
I have some good news
and some... better news.

17:28.083 --> 17:31.750
- Where should I start?
- You know, I miss Americans. Go on.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.916
The good news is that we've been having

17:34.916 --> 17:39.500
some very eager conversations
with our European customers.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.750
Cheers to that.

17:40.750 --> 17:46.333
ACM's goal, no matter what
the result of this blasted war, is simple.

17:46.958 --> 17:50.500
We wanna see American business
thrive in the region.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.958
Well, how else
can we exert democratic influence?

17:52.958 --> 17:55.541
We have to preserve
our ability to work with both sides.

17:55.541 --> 17:56.583
That's right.

17:57.083 --> 18:01.291
Roosevelt declares war, well,
he'll be forfeiting our seat at the table.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.083
I couldn't agree with you more.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.208
Which brings me to the better news.

18:06.958 --> 18:10.125
ACM would like
to officially offer you a job.

18:12.458 --> 18:13.291
Me?

18:13.916 --> 18:15.791
Let me know if I'm out of line here,

18:15.791 --> 18:18.875
but we need someone
to be our man in Europe,

18:19.791 --> 18:22.291
and I can think of no one better than you.

18:22.791 --> 18:26.625
That is, if and when you're ready
to move into the private sector.

18:34.541 --> 18:36.541
Well, as it happens,

18:37.208 --> 18:39.458
I'm entitled to retire
from the Foreign Service

18:39.458 --> 18:41.250
when I turn 50 this spring.

18:57.875 --> 18:58.750
Varian.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.125
Why are you so angry?

19:06.375 --> 19:10.958
Which of the many laws that I've broken
offends you the most? Fighting fascism?

19:14.125 --> 19:15.291
Harboring radicals?

19:16.291 --> 19:18.000
- Loving men?
- Stop.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.333
If I have to live a life where
everything worth fighting for is illegal

19:21.333 --> 19:23.416
and everything worth doing is a crime,

19:25.041 --> 19:26.541
then call me a criminal.

19:28.958 --> 19:30.250
I won't apologize for that.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.166
You lied to me
about who you're working for.

19:33.166 --> 19:35.625
By omission. For a reason.

19:35.625 --> 19:38.750
And in doing so,
you have threatened my entire operation.

19:39.500 --> 19:42.833
It's only a matter of time before
the French discover I'm operating out of--

19:42.833 --> 19:45.000
What? A British spy nest!

19:45.875 --> 19:48.583
And when the Americans find out,
I'm gonna get it from both sides.

19:48.583 --> 19:51.416
What I should do is
I should leave this house

19:52.000 --> 19:55.125
and take everyone in it with me.
But where would we go, Thomas?

19:56.166 --> 19:57.541
There's nowhere to go!

20:05.666 --> 20:07.416
Why are you working for the British?

20:12.125 --> 20:15.041
Because they're the only ones
fighting the Nazis.

20:17.708 --> 20:19.666
Winston Churchill is a friend of the Jews.

20:19.666 --> 20:23.250
Winston Churchill is a virulent
anti-Semite behind closed doors.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.708
I don't care what he does
behind closed doors.

20:25.708 --> 20:28.291
I actually don't care what anyone does
behind closed doors.

20:30.583 --> 20:33.250
Churchill's promised
to deliver us a homeland.

20:35.958 --> 20:36.958
And we need one.

20:57.958 --> 20:58.791
Hannah.

21:03.333 --> 21:04.750
I really can't help you.

21:07.625 --> 21:10.708
Lost my job,
and I've been kicked out of France.

21:11.833 --> 21:13.333
But you still have rights.

21:14.375 --> 21:15.541
American rights!

21:15.541 --> 21:17.166
But I'm in France.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.666
We are all in France, Mr. Fry.

21:20.458 --> 21:21.291
Yeah.

21:21.291 --> 21:24.500
As an American, you have
the right to stay here as a tourist.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.791
I don't.

21:25.791 --> 21:28.541
I am probably
the most German person you know.

21:29.708 --> 21:31.541
I miss everything about my home country.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.375
The language,

21:34.125 --> 21:35.208
the poetry,

21:35.791 --> 21:36.875
even the weather.

21:39.041 --> 21:41.875
But I am no longer a German citizen.
You see?

21:42.791 --> 21:43.791
No rights.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.125
You must be terribly homesick.

21:50.750 --> 21:51.916
Homesick?

21:53.125 --> 21:55.416
Homeless, Mr. Fry.

21:57.708 --> 21:59.041
I'm stateless.

22:02.208 --> 22:03.833
The only entrance is here.

22:06.125 --> 22:11.083
The barbed wire here is weak
in some places and thin enough to be cut.

22:12.541 --> 22:15.708
When I was there,
some boys were trying to tunnel out here.

22:16.208 --> 22:18.291
It all comes down
to getting the soldiers

22:18.291 --> 22:20.083
to the right place at the right time.

22:20.083 --> 22:22.541
I'm sure they've fixed it.
Maybe, maybe not.

22:22.541 --> 22:23.791
At least it's possible.

22:23.791 --> 22:25.875
Touré has a sharpshooter uniform for me.

22:25.875 --> 22:29.250
You distract the guards at the front.
I will slip inside to find the men.

22:29.250 --> 22:31.916
Then we meet you around here,
the barbed wire.

22:31.916 --> 22:34.625
- Mm-hmm.
- And if you get stuck inside?

22:37.125 --> 22:38.041
I won't.

22:40.875 --> 22:42.916
Touré told the prisoners
to expect us tonight.

22:42.916 --> 22:44.000
Good.

22:45.833 --> 22:47.458
Do you know Hans Fittko?

22:48.750 --> 22:49.666
What?

22:50.166 --> 22:52.541
Do you know someone
whose name is Hans Fittko?

22:53.500 --> 22:56.041
This is the list
of current prisoners in Camp des Milles.

23:03.125 --> 23:04.125
But he's dead.

23:08.208 --> 23:09.583
What's going on?

23:09.583 --> 23:13.083
There’s a man named Hans Fittko
at Des Milles with the British prisoners.

23:14.625 --> 23:15.750
Your brother?

23:19.750 --> 23:20.958
My husband.

23:21.916 --> 23:23.208
What?

23:23.208 --> 23:24.541
You're married?

23:26.333 --> 23:27.541
This can't be right.

23:28.875 --> 23:32.333
But what if it is?
If it is, then we have to get him out.

23:32.833 --> 23:35.291
Please, let me do this for you.

23:35.291 --> 23:37.250
Please, because I owe you.

23:39.666 --> 23:40.625
- Yes.

23:40.625 --> 23:43.000
Yes.
- Mary Jayne, don't do this.

23:44.291 --> 23:45.625
This is not your concern.

23:45.625 --> 23:49.625
Drop me off at the front gate.
I'm gonna use Dagobert as a distraction.

23:49.625 --> 23:50.958
Your dog?

23:50.958 --> 23:54.833
This is my mission, and I'm gonna run it
how I see fit. Do you drive?

23:54.833 --> 23:57.250
- Mary Jayne.
- I thought I was on my own.

24:08.625 --> 24:09.708
Um...

24:11.875 --> 24:15.541
We need to show Lisa's husband
something familiar or he won't trust us.

24:19.041 --> 24:20.333
You must have something.

24:22.666 --> 24:23.666
One thing.

24:25.416 --> 24:26.791
My wedding ring.

24:28.875 --> 24:29.875
Bring it to me.

24:31.625 --> 24:32.541
Paul...

24:36.541 --> 24:38.250
I thought he was dead.

24:42.625 --> 24:43.750
War is complicated.

24:45.458 --> 24:46.416
He's a good man.

24:48.750 --> 24:49.833
Just get the ring.

24:50.708 --> 24:51.625
Please.

25:09.625 --> 25:10.833
Thank you, sir.

25:12.166 --> 25:14.416
Tourist visas? Number 134.

25:14.416 --> 25:15.333
Yes.

25:20.958 --> 25:21.791
Three months.

25:22.541 --> 25:25.041
I just need your local address.
Is this it?

25:25.041 --> 25:26.041
Yes.

25:26.791 --> 25:27.875
Is it a hotel?

25:27.875 --> 25:30.666
No. A private residence.

25:30.666 --> 25:33.916
Ah. Then we need the signature
of your landlord. One moment.

25:33.916 --> 25:35.375
Sir, excuse me--

25:53.375 --> 25:55.500
Villa Air-Bel. 63 Avenue Jean Lombard?

25:55.500 --> 25:59.416
Yes. Why is this necessary?
The landlord is Thomas Lovegrove.

26:00.333 --> 26:04.541
But it says here that the house belongs to
a certain Mrs. Marguerite Nouget.

26:06.666 --> 26:08.500
Uh... All right.

26:22.916 --> 26:23.875
Madame Nouget<i>.</i>

26:24.458 --> 26:25.333
Mr. Fry.

26:33.666 --> 26:35.125
I believe I have

26:36.250 --> 26:38.041
something I need you to sign.

26:41.041 --> 26:45.625
If this is correct, um,
I... I need your signature here.

27:11.208 --> 27:12.333
Have a good day.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.500
Thank you.

27:25.458 --> 27:27.708
You think this will work?
We're in France.

27:27.708 --> 27:30.875
You think a white guard
can tell two Black men apart?

27:46.416 --> 27:47.833
Good luck.

27:49.708 --> 27:51.541
I'll see you on the other side.

27:54.791 --> 27:58.500
This will work out.
This will work out. This will work out.

28:02.416 --> 28:03.250
That's fine.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.208
Good evening.

28:22.625 --> 28:23.458
Good evening.

28:23.458 --> 28:26.250
Do you remember me?
I'm here to see my husband.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.458
My husband.

28:27.458 --> 28:29.166
Now? No. No visitors.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.708
Are you sure?

28:30.708 --> 28:33.333
I think you
didn't understand me. You must leave!

28:33.333 --> 28:34.958
Understood.

28:43.375 --> 28:44.625
Oh no!

28:45.208 --> 28:47.125
My dog!

28:47.125 --> 28:48.916
The dog!
No!

28:50.166 --> 28:51.583
Catch the dog!

28:55.708 --> 28:57.541
Dagobert!

28:57.541 --> 28:58.583
Catch the dog!

28:58.583 --> 29:00.625
Oh my God! Dagobert!

30:08.041 --> 30:09.166
You okay?
- Yes. Yes.

30:09.166 --> 30:10.500
- You okay?
- Yeah. It went well?

30:17.541 --> 30:18.375
Go.

30:19.291 --> 30:20.208
Run. Run. Run.

30:35.666 --> 30:36.833
This way.

30:37.541 --> 30:39.041
- You see the light?
- Yeah.

30:45.333 --> 30:46.291
Okay.

30:52.541 --> 30:56.000
Listen up! Listen up! Keep going that way.
We'll meet you at the car.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.416
Wait! Where's Paul? Where's Paul?

30:57.416 --> 30:58.625
- Paul?
Paul.

30:58.625 --> 30:59.666
I don't...

31:00.458 --> 31:02.208
- Where's Paul?
- I don't know.

31:06.625 --> 31:07.625
Push!

31:09.541 --> 31:10.625
Come on.

31:10.625 --> 31:12.083
Oh. Ooh.

31:12.083 --> 31:13.541
Hurry up. Come on.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.583
Dagobert!

31:18.125 --> 31:21.041
My God, Dagobert! No!
I have to go get him.

31:21.541 --> 31:24.625
- Mary Jayne, stop!
- No, it's fine! Leave me. I'll be okay.

31:24.625 --> 31:26.166
It's fine. I'll be all right.

31:26.166 --> 31:28.250
Take my car. You have my keys.
Just leave me!

31:28.250 --> 31:30.125
I cannot leave you behind.

31:30.125 --> 31:34.333
Stop! Stop! Stop!

31:35.083 --> 31:38.041
Shit!
Let's go! Come on, let's go!

31:38.041 --> 31:40.333
Okay.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.291
Beautiful.

32:05.250 --> 32:07.083
You solved your visa problem?

32:08.666 --> 32:09.666
Yes.

32:10.333 --> 32:11.333
And mine?

32:12.208 --> 32:13.375
Believe me,

32:13.375 --> 32:17.625
if I could do something, I would do it.

32:17.625 --> 32:18.541
Would you?

32:19.416 --> 32:22.458
Most people
no longer dare to act independently.

32:22.458 --> 32:24.875
I am not like most people.

32:27.208 --> 32:28.333
Prove it.

32:49.291 --> 32:50.208
Mary Jayne.

32:51.666 --> 32:53.208
Hey. What happened?

32:53.958 --> 32:55.833
Everything went perfectly.
We just...

32:57.208 --> 32:58.250
We lost the dog.

32:59.291 --> 33:00.750
What about the POWs?

33:00.750 --> 33:02.791
They're coming up the driveway
on the bikes.

33:03.291 --> 33:04.500
Where is Lisa?

33:09.291 --> 33:10.291
I'm fine.

33:14.500 --> 33:15.500
I...

33:19.583 --> 33:20.625
I waited for you.

33:27.541 --> 33:28.916
You never showed up!

33:30.125 --> 33:30.958
Lisa.

33:31.458 --> 33:33.250
You never showed up!

33:54.708 --> 33:55.708
Lisa.

34:17.916 --> 34:18.916
Mary Jayne.

34:20.375 --> 34:21.375
I...

34:44.750 --> 34:46.208
I know how you feel.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.500
I have lost...

34:54.583 --> 34:55.583
everyone.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.083
I lost my parents,

35:00.250 --> 35:01.333
my friends.

35:06.250 --> 35:07.375
I lost my sister.

35:09.625 --> 35:10.541
Ursula?

35:11.041 --> 35:12.541
No. No, I...

35:15.083 --> 35:16.291
I have another one.

35:18.625 --> 35:19.541
Eva.

35:21.416 --> 35:22.708
Eva's the little one.

35:23.708 --> 35:24.625
Oh.

35:25.666 --> 35:26.666
You know, um...

35:29.833 --> 35:32.708
you cannot just fall to pieces right now,

35:32.708 --> 35:34.833
because you...

35:37.041 --> 35:38.625
you were amazing today.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.666
That was such a difficult mission,

35:42.666 --> 35:46.583
and you were so determined
to save Lisa's husband.

35:46.583 --> 35:47.875
And, well,

35:48.750 --> 35:49.750
we did it.

35:55.833 --> 35:57.416
But you have to

35:58.958 --> 36:00.708
keep moving forward

36:01.958 --> 36:03.500
because...

36:38.916 --> 36:39.791
Lisa.

37:11.750 --> 37:14.500
Just thinking of you
kept me alive in there.

37:52.833 --> 37:54.375
I'm a criminal too.

37:58.166 --> 37:59.041
I know.

38:03.666 --> 38:05.958
Why does Madame Nouget own this house?

38:16.125 --> 38:18.416
She worked for me for years in Paris.

38:19.958 --> 38:21.625
Knew what I was doing there.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.083
She knows what we're doing here?

38:34.583 --> 38:36.625
I was smuggling Jews to Palestine.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.333
And when the Nazis came to Paris...

38:42.750 --> 38:44.041
she helped me escape.

38:47.291 --> 38:48.583
I owe her everything.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.958
One day, I'll have to leave here too.

38:57.208 --> 38:59.375
But then I'll leave her with this house.

39:07.416 --> 39:10.041
This is a new world, Varian.

39:12.333 --> 39:13.958
The old rules don't apply.

39:20.541 --> 39:22.416
But if the rules don't apply,

39:23.833 --> 39:25.833
where are we supposed to find our compass?

39:29.625 --> 39:30.625
In ourselves.

39:33.625 --> 39:34.625
In each other.

40:36.833 --> 40:37.666
Uh...

40:37.666 --> 40:38.750
Good morning.

40:46.875 --> 40:48.958
I had the best night.

40:58.875 --> 41:00.791
Feels good to say it in German.

41:01.541 --> 41:04.208
It is not our language that has gone mad.

41:06.166 --> 41:07.125
No.

41:10.208 --> 41:12.791
One day
Germany will recover from all this.

41:13.833 --> 41:15.208
One day, maybe.

41:16.458 --> 41:17.833
But we live now.

41:22.625 --> 41:24.583
Right now I feel very much alive.

42:24.708 --> 42:25.958
<i>My dear brother.</i>

42:27.041 --> 42:30.708
<i>I have finally managed to get
American visas for both of us.</i>

42:32.041 --> 42:35.708
<i>You can pick up yours
at the American consulate in Marseille.</i>

42:36.416 --> 42:40.291
<i>I know you don't like
people telling you what to do,</i>

42:41.208 --> 42:44.833
<i>but</i>, <i>out of respect for our parents,
please collect the visa.</i>

42:45.625 --> 42:49.458
<i>Come meet me in Lisbon
so we can travel to America together.</i>

42:51.458 --> 42:53.416
<i>We've both already lost so much.</i>

42:55.041 --> 42:57.000
<i>I refuse to leave you behind.</i>

42:58.208 --> 43:00.333
<i>Your loving sister, Ursula.</i>

43:24.125 --> 43:25.000
Bingham.

43:27.958 --> 43:31.708
Thanks for meeting me here.
- I'm sorry about Reese. I had no idea.

43:33.333 --> 43:36.458
It was humiliating, but he's harmless.
I'm working around him.

43:36.458 --> 43:38.333
Didn't Patterson
try to kick you out of France?

43:38.333 --> 43:40.083
I don't give up that easily.

43:40.083 --> 43:43.375
Good.
<i>-</i> Yeah, I need you to do something for me.

43:44.750 --> 43:48.791
Her name is Hannah Arendt. I've got
a spot for her on a ship to the Caribbean.

43:48.791 --> 43:50.166
Captain's a friend of mine.

43:51.291 --> 43:52.291
She needs a visa.

43:52.291 --> 43:53.708
The port is closed.

43:53.708 --> 43:56.333
It'll reopen, and when it does,
we're gonna be ready.

43:56.333 --> 43:59.416
Actually, I'm gonna need
a lot more visas. It's a big boat.

43:59.416 --> 44:01.833
Look. You should see the memos coming down

44:01.833 --> 44:03.958
from the top brass
of the State Department.

44:05.916 --> 44:08.583
Uh, "Jews are suffering,
but the history of their race shows

44:08.583 --> 44:10.791
that suffering does not kill
many of them."

44:10.791 --> 44:12.166
"If we have to accept any,

44:12.166 --> 44:15.625
only old people who will not reproduce
and can do our country no harm."

44:16.500 --> 44:19.125
They're turning boats of refugees away
from New York Harbor

44:19.125 --> 44:20.875
for fear there are German spies onboard.

44:21.750 --> 44:24.708
Meanwhile, my boss,
my father, so many others...

44:25.208 --> 44:26.916
Look, I'm on your side,

44:26.916 --> 44:30.750
but honestly, Varian,
I can't just disobey direct orders.

44:30.750 --> 44:31.875
Yes, you can!

44:31.875 --> 44:34.875
List me as her sponsor.
Tell Patterson I put a gun to your head.

44:34.875 --> 44:35.875
I don't care.

44:37.875 --> 44:38.875
Do what you can.

44:42.916 --> 44:43.833
Please!

44:44.583 --> 44:46.250
I can do three a week,

44:47.333 --> 44:48.208
tops.

44:50.041 --> 44:50.958
Thank you.

45:19.750 --> 45:20.708
Paul.

45:23.625 --> 45:25.250
Thank you for freeing our men.

45:25.250 --> 45:26.166
Our men?

45:27.041 --> 45:27.958
You're British.

45:29.125 --> 45:31.291
The British are
on the right side of this fight,

45:31.291 --> 45:32.916
so I'm in the fight with them.

45:35.250 --> 45:37.541
I hear you have
a lot to say about the world.

45:37.541 --> 45:38.916
Big plans.

45:40.541 --> 45:43.833
I believe this war will be
a chance for us to reimagine who we are,

45:44.416 --> 45:47.041
to fight our way to freedom
from the inside out.

45:47.791 --> 45:51.166
Europe will be freed.
Then the colonies will be freed.

45:56.958 --> 45:58.833
What do you have in mind, Paul?

45:59.833 --> 46:04.541
The entire Nazi logistical apparatus
relies on the railway.

46:04.541 --> 46:07.750
The South of France
is not under Nazi occupation.

46:07.750 --> 46:08.666
Not yet.

46:09.916 --> 46:12.250
- We need to cut the jugular now.
- How?

46:14.833 --> 46:18.291
Targeted attacks on the main railway line

46:18.291 --> 46:21.000
connecting the south
to the Gestapo in Dijon.

46:22.541 --> 46:24.375
Bridges are not easily rebuilt.

46:26.208 --> 46:29.875
We need explosives,
possibly weapons, and intelligence too.

46:31.750 --> 46:33.166
Can you provide that?

46:37.333 --> 46:38.333
Yes.

47:31.750 --> 47:36.000
For you, little girl.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.500
Thank you, Hans.

47:38.333 --> 47:39.958
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

47:39.958 --> 47:41.708
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

47:42.916 --> 47:45.166
Sorry I couldn't get you home.

47:45.166 --> 47:46.583
Believe me, Ms. Gold,

47:46.583 --> 47:49.916
this is a much nicer Christmas
than we were expecting.

47:51.458 --> 47:52.875
Happy Christmas.

47:52.875 --> 47:55.125
Happy Christmas.
Happy Christmas.

48:06.333 --> 48:07.416
Merry Christmas.

48:20.708 --> 48:22.291
- Hm.

48:31.041 --> 48:33.708
Commissaire! Merry Christmas!

48:33.708 --> 48:35.125
What can I do for you?

48:35.750 --> 48:39.750
The American woman
broke into a prison camp.

48:40.375 --> 48:41.833
What? Who?

48:41.833 --> 48:43.250
Mary Jayne Gold.

48:46.708 --> 48:49.291
Mary Jayne Gold
couldn't break into a bowl of cereal.

48:49.291 --> 48:50.333
Oh no?

48:50.833 --> 48:52.750
You do not know this creature?

48:56.500 --> 48:59.625
Mademoiselle Gold is
working for the British.

49:02.375 --> 49:03.375
The British?

49:04.000 --> 49:07.666
She freed three British soldiers
and left the dog behind.

49:10.041 --> 49:11.625
This Is a war crime.

49:13.333 --> 49:16.333
- You can't hold <i>me</i> responsible for that.
- Oh yes, I can.
