00:09.283 --> 00:10.790
Thank God you're seeing it too.

00:10.869 --> 00:13.853
I thought my X-ray vision was back.

00:15.235 --> 00:18.315
God bless the annual naked bike ride.

00:18.658 --> 00:19.610
And where's Oleg?

00:19.658 --> 00:21.947
This is the first lunch rush in years.

00:22.031 --> 00:24.297
Uh, the guy at table
three needs some water

00:24.345 --> 00:26.783
and has an ass mole that
should really get looked at,

00:26.990 --> 00:28.698
but not by me.

00:33.477 --> 00:36.220
Oleg, you're doing the
naked bike ride too?

00:36.384 --> 00:38.384
The naked what?

00:39.744 --> 00:41.056
Okay, gang.

00:41.186 --> 00:42.564
Let's hit the road.

00:42.642 --> 00:43.720
(gasps)

00:43.806 --> 00:45.009
Ugh, oh!

00:45.095 --> 00:46.095
Ooh, ah!

00:46.298 --> 00:47.517
I don't know where to look now.

00:47.564 --> 00:49.139
Nothing's good.

00:52.509 --> 00:55.189
Well, now we have to
burn this place down.

Don't try and stop me.

01:14.322 --> 01:16.525
I'll Mountain Dew it.

01:17.220 --> 01:19.931
You know I'm crazy
when I'm all Coked up.

01:20.283 --> 01:22.439
So I heard a lot of noise

01:22.541 --> 01:23.924
coming from your room last night.

01:24.033 --> 01:25.792
And since I know that bat is dead,

01:25.877 --> 01:28.736
because it had a heart
attack on my pillow,

01:28.838 --> 01:31.455
I assume you had a gentleman caller?

01:31.634 --> 01:32.700
He wasn't a gentleman,

01:32.747 --> 01:35.556
but he did wear a
monocle while we did it.

01:36.306 --> 01:39.712
Well, you had a much more
exciting night than I did.

01:39.853 --> 01:42.666
Both of my legs fell
asleep on the toilet.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.556
Then so did I.

01:45.142 --> 01:47.291
So you aren't gonna see him again?

01:47.419 --> 01:49.041
Well, we know every
time Earl walks away,

01:49.119 --> 01:50.666
there's a chance of that.

01:51.956 --> 01:53.679
I have an announcement.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.756
Whoever keeps putting
peanut butter in my desk,

01:55.803 --> 01:56.715
stop.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.337
I'm allergic.

01:58.759 --> 02:00.955
And I'm closing the diner Sunday.

02:01.845 --> 02:04.384
Well, we had a good run.

02:04.580 --> 02:05.587
No, we didn't.

02:05.673 --> 02:07.916
Let's scavenge, people!

02:08.586 --> 02:09.627
Bye, y'all!

02:09.697 --> 02:11.642
Where do we keep the money at?

02:11.986 --> 02:14.197
(paper shredder whirring)

02:14.759 --> 02:15.868
What?

02:15.931 --> 02:17.158
I don't want our meat order

02:17.225 --> 02:19.462
to fall into the wrong hands.

02:20.275 --> 02:21.707
No, you pile of felons.

02:21.783 --> 02:24.580
I'm closing the diner for Sunday only.

02:24.697 --> 02:27.181
Well, I'm keeping this stuff anyway.

02:27.423 --> 02:29.314
And I really hate it.

02:29.447 --> 02:31.845
My new therapist, Gary,
says that I need

02:31.900 --> 02:34.369
to take a day off to focus on myself.

02:34.478 --> 02:37.126
Did he give you a
magnifying glass for that?

02:37.282 --> 02:39.261
Max, Gary says you use

02:39.408 --> 02:41.260
your toxic, mean-spirited jokes

02:41.337 --> 02:43.603
to keep people like me at a distance.

02:43.712 --> 02:44.897
You know what else works?

02:44.970 --> 02:46.861
Putting my hand on your forehead.

02:47.087 --> 02:48.666
Max, Gary also says

02:48.751 --> 02:50.150
you have a fear of intimacy

02:50.212 --> 02:52.673
stemming from your
father abandoning you.

02:52.775 --> 02:55.486
To put it simply,
you have daddy issues.

02:55.618 --> 02:57.400
The only daddy issues I have

02:57.478 --> 02:59.298
are of <i>Rod Magazine.</i>

02:59.525 --> 03:01.962
And there's no such
thing as daddy issues.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.430
If there was, why would
my daughter be married

03:04.478 --> 03:07.658
to a forgetful older man named Burl?

03:08.166 --> 03:09.751
What did Gary say about me, Han?

03:09.830 --> 03:12.376
Were the words "Eliza Doolittle" used?

03:12.470 --> 03:15.041
Well, you certainly do little,

03:15.174 --> 03:16.978
but actually, you didn't come up.

03:17.079 --> 03:18.642
You don't come up to my knees.

03:18.775 --> 03:20.533
See? That's the kind
of material you need

03:20.581 --> 03:22.376
to get a shout-out.

03:23.181 --> 03:24.798
Hey, everybody!

03:27.447 --> 03:31.884
Barbara just smiled politely
at her first ugly baby.

03:32.103 --> 03:35.501
Oh, I could learn some
manners from her.

03:35.714 --> 03:38.767
Sophie, it's really not
nice to call a baby "ugly."

03:38.853 --> 03:40.291
Shut up!

03:40.830 --> 03:42.988
Oh, I mean...

03:43.136 --> 03:44.751
(cheerfully) Shut up!

03:45.533 --> 03:46.751
Good news, Sophie.

03:46.853 --> 03:48.158
I don't have to work here

03:48.244 --> 03:50.525
or Bubzie's Hideaway this Sunday.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.673
We can get a babysitter

03:51.721 --> 03:53.720
and spend the whole day together.

03:53.986 --> 03:55.595
Well, if you're suggesting

03:55.666 --> 03:58.142
that we have sex at
the dog track again,

03:58.251 --> 04:01.181
then I'm gonna tell you
what I said at the dog track.

04:01.337 --> 04:03.267
(barking)

04:06.087 --> 04:08.341
Well, now we all need therapy.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.166
Oh, Bobby, I'm so sorry

04:12.264 --> 04:15.126
you have to go to your great
aunt's funeral on Sunday.

04:15.267 --> 04:18.555
I really wanted to get lunch
and some towels at Ikea.

04:18.781 --> 04:20.291
Ooh, if you're going to Ikea,

04:20.345 --> 04:22.470
can you get me
a snars-vaten-woggen?

04:22.603 --> 04:24.572
I need a place to put my book light.

04:24.744 --> 04:26.498
Okay, I understand.

04:26.611 --> 04:28.367
I guess the real lesson is,

04:28.509 --> 04:31.064
don't lie about your
weight on a hot-air balloon.

04:32.095 --> 04:34.080
I am so, so sorry...

04:34.173 --> 04:37.447
that I had to listen to that
horrible phone conversation.

04:37.595 --> 04:39.252
You know, Max, it's
actually a good thing

04:39.302 --> 04:41.649
that Bobby's aunt died tragically.

04:41.806 --> 04:43.081
Now we can do inventory here

04:43.166 --> 04:44.908
and get ahead on our books on Sunday.

04:45.041 --> 04:46.126
Only you could turn a death

04:46.181 --> 04:47.900
into something depressing.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.541
(chuckles) Speaking of
something depressing.

04:51.830 --> 04:54.059
I just came by to let you know

04:54.212 --> 04:55.486
you're late for the diner,

04:55.572 --> 04:56.978
and you know, Max,

04:57.111 --> 04:59.025
I had a working brunch with Gary,

04:59.142 --> 05:00.431
and he made a good point

05:00.502 --> 05:02.830
as he pretended
to reach for the check.

05:02.986 --> 05:04.962
He said it was unfair of me

05:05.056 --> 05:06.305
to bring up your problems

05:06.377 --> 05:08.415
without offering a solution.

05:08.783 --> 05:11.666
You need to talk to your father.

05:11.822 --> 05:15.283
Han, you are really
overstepping your boundaries,

05:15.377 --> 05:18.017
which is really rude,
because that's my job.

05:18.077 --> 05:19.556
Uh, it's fine.

05:19.658 --> 05:21.028
Yeah, go ahead, Han.

05:21.111 --> 05:22.421
Try and find my father.

05:22.533 --> 05:24.665
I don't know his name, where he lives,

05:24.728 --> 05:27.619
or where he gets dialysis,
I'm assuming.

05:27.681 --> 05:29.517
So good luck with that.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.017
Here's his name and number.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.627
He lives in Rhode Island,

05:32.744 --> 05:35.400
America's least exciting state.

05:36.595 --> 05:38.070
How did you find that?

05:38.173 --> 05:39.923
That is way over the line,

05:39.986 --> 05:42.470
and I really wish it was
me who had done it.

05:42.783 --> 05:44.518
Unlike Max in high school,

05:44.619 --> 05:46.361
it wasn't easy.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.889
I called the hospital
for her birth certificate,

05:48.994 --> 05:50.743
which led me to the hall of records,

05:50.791 --> 05:52.650
which then led me to
some forced necking

05:52.721 --> 05:55.072
with a clerk named Shelley.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.283
Sadly, it was a dead end.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.580
So Gary got it for me.

05:58.673 --> 06:00.908
His sister's a psychic for the police.

06:02.314 --> 06:04.845
So are you gonna call your dad

06:04.939 --> 06:07.103
after all that hard work Han and I did

06:07.173 --> 06:08.681
to find his number?

06:09.056 --> 06:10.244
I don't know.

06:10.345 --> 06:11.760
This is a huge decision,
and I really want

06:11.807 --> 06:13.205
to think this through.

06:13.517 --> 06:15.337
Max, I think that's a really smart

06:15.456 --> 06:16.325
and mature decis...

06:16.448 --> 06:17.955
Thought about it.

06:24.712 --> 06:25.907
Okay, we're missing

06:25.955 --> 06:27.003
two bottles of tequila,

06:27.072 --> 06:28.877
but I did find a bloody knife,

06:28.962 --> 06:31.064
so that's a wrap on inventory.

06:31.119 --> 06:32.142
Oh, thank God.

06:32.190 --> 06:33.149
I've been killing myself

06:33.197 --> 06:34.552
with all this paperwork.

06:34.705 --> 06:37.572
It took me 30 minutes to make this hat.

06:37.908 --> 06:40.962
Max, I know what's
really going on here.

06:41.048 --> 06:42.830
You're trying to hide
it by doing origami,

06:42.878 --> 06:45.267
but you're really thinking
about contacting your dad.

06:45.377 --> 06:47.033
Uh, actually, I was thinking

06:47.133 --> 06:48.503
about where I left my bloody knife,

06:48.550 --> 06:51.142
but you solved that mystery.

06:51.236 --> 06:53.913
So now I'm thinking about wrestling.

06:54.070 --> 06:55.898
Wrestling with your emotions?

06:55.976 --> 06:57.812
No, with Jeremy Piven.

06:58.015 --> 07:00.179
Short arms. I can take him.

07:00.851 --> 07:03.710
Well, in the off-chance you do
want to contact your father,

07:03.780 --> 07:06.843
I used my amazing jigsaw puzzle talents

07:06.976 --> 07:08.726
to put his number back together.

07:08.835 --> 07:11.515
I was runner-up in Jigsaw Palooza 2003.

07:11.633 --> 07:12.812
Oh, thank God.

07:12.829 --> 07:14.192
Thank you, Caroline...

07:14.240 --> 07:16.523
for letting me rip this up again.

07:16.997 --> 07:18.610
You know, I hate to say this,

07:18.658 --> 07:20.680
but Han's not wrong.

07:20.757 --> 07:22.062
How dare you?

07:22.180 --> 07:23.531
Let me finish.

07:23.605 --> 07:26.127
Maybe you do have some intimacy issues.

07:26.175 --> 07:28.765
I mean, you haven't really
dated anyone since Randy,

07:28.813 --> 07:31.401
and I still don't have a
key to our apartment.

07:31.483 --> 07:34.468
I gave you that screwdriver. It works.

07:34.624 --> 07:37.413
You're not even a little
curious to meet him?

07:38.019 --> 07:39.809
I guess maybe a little.

07:39.874 --> 07:42.684
Maybe it'll explain some of the
more disturbing things about me,

07:42.731 --> 07:46.117
like how I prefer Cocoa
Pebbles over Fruity Pebbles.

07:46.226 --> 07:49.234
Yes! You can finally get those answers.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.257
I say we go now,
before you change your mind.

07:51.344 --> 07:53.015
Should we steal some
snacks from the diner

07:53.102 --> 07:55.202
before we steal Han's car?

07:57.110 --> 07:58.304
MAX: Earl, what are you doing here?

07:58.351 --> 07:59.882
You know you're off today, right?

07:59.938 --> 08:02.719
Uh, I forgot my weed here.

08:02.890 --> 08:04.163
Then I smoked it.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.890
And now it doesn't matter where I am.

08:07.679 --> 08:09.734
♪ Squee, diddly-Doo ♪

08:10.861 --> 08:14.187
I'm not working on my
Gary-prescribed day off.

08:14.272 --> 08:17.584
I just swung by to...
to meet a friend...

08:17.648 --> 08:19.656
named Friendo.

08:20.523 --> 08:22.085
He's Italian.

08:22.156 --> 08:23.632
What are you doing here?

08:23.734 --> 08:25.382
We're going to meet Max's dad.

08:25.437 --> 08:26.592
Because of me.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.335
It's my thing now.

08:28.531 --> 08:30.296
So you're giving up your other thing?

08:30.359 --> 08:31.562
Complimenting yourself

08:31.626 --> 08:33.351
while the customers starve?

08:34.365 --> 08:36.234
Earl, why don't you come with?

08:36.327 --> 08:38.655
I want my real dad
to meet my birth dad.

08:39.022 --> 08:41.570
Sure. Which one am I again?

08:42.523 --> 08:43.836
Can I come too?

08:43.898 --> 08:45.747
Gary would love to hear about the man

08:45.818 --> 08:47.498
responsible for my misery.

08:47.601 --> 08:50.371
Isn't that the cartoonist
who erased half your body?

08:52.156 --> 08:53.906
Ugh, great.

08:53.976 --> 08:56.781
Other looters got here first.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.710
This is what happens
when you stop for snacks

08:59.758 --> 09:02.320
on your way to stop for more snacks.

09:02.468 --> 09:05.195
We're going for a
romantic ride in the country.

09:05.335 --> 09:08.038
We're looking for a farm
where we can do it.

09:08.483 --> 09:10.467
We were just gonna ask Han
to drive us to Rhode Island,

09:10.514 --> 09:11.624
but this is better.

09:11.672 --> 09:12.712
With your minivan,

09:12.760 --> 09:15.031
we can sit much further
from the driver.

09:15.154 --> 09:17.111
Rhode Island?

09:17.952 --> 09:20.081
Are we gonna bury a dead body?

09:20.304 --> 09:22.054
No, but I am coming,

09:22.124 --> 09:24.510
so don't get any ideas.

09:24.882 --> 09:27.718
Well, I haven't been in a
van with this many weirdos

09:27.827 --> 09:30.038
since the second time I got kidnapped.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.273
All right, your dad just confirmed.

09:34.321 --> 09:37.085
We're meeting him at 4:00
at the Rhode Island Diner.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.945
Max's reunion with her father
is really humming along

09:39.993 --> 09:41.948
since I took the reins from Han.

09:42.022 --> 09:43.301
Don't kid yourself.

09:43.349 --> 09:44.770
I laid the groundwork.

09:44.944 --> 09:45.890
Don't kid yourself.

09:45.945 --> 09:47.724
You've never laid anything.

09:47.898 --> 09:50.578
Oleg, shouldn't we be
getting off at the next exit?

09:51.140 --> 09:54.740
Do you think we should
exit at 33B, Misty?

09:54.835 --> 09:57.085
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Ooh, that exit is closed

09:57.199 --> 10:00.077
for construction, naughty boy.

10:00.359 --> 10:02.562
Since we're having a
day off from Barbara,

10:02.610 --> 10:05.554
I put the GPS on XXX.

10:06.265 --> 10:09.101
Can't a woman just talk to you?

10:09.195 --> 10:11.288
This is why we march.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.390
How about a fun car game?

10:14.640 --> 10:16.871
I spy with my little eye

10:17.015 --> 10:18.940
something that is black.

10:19.249 --> 10:21.913
You better watch yourself, son.

10:22.257 --> 10:25.070
No, I was referring to...

10:25.317 --> 10:26.457
pass.

10:27.406 --> 10:28.808
Max, are you nervous?

10:28.855 --> 10:31.177
You have that nervous
metallic smell you get

10:31.224 --> 10:33.499
when you find out
7-Eleven's out of hot dogs.

10:33.577 --> 10:35.265
No.

10:35.546 --> 10:38.116
I keep a lot of nickels in these pants.

10:40.296 --> 10:42.015

10:46.902 --> 10:48.833
Sophie, are you okay?

10:49.343 --> 10:52.707
Yeah, that's just how I wake up.

10:52.754 --> 10:55.544
Are you okay?

10:55.684 --> 10:56.873
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE: Ooh, ah!

10:56.920 --> 10:58.887
Bear right at the next exit.

10:58.935 --> 11:00.059
Just like that.

11:00.107 --> 11:01.544
Don't stop!

11:01.777 --> 11:03.723
Okay, Misty.

11:04.340 --> 11:07.561
I think I went to hair
school with your GPS.

Slow down, big boy.

11:12.406 --> 11:13.655

11:14.567 --> 11:16.535
Uh-oh, I hit a squirrel

11:16.583 --> 11:18.504
or John Travolta's toupee.

11:18.676 --> 11:21.765
Either way, its legs are still moving.

11:21.883 --> 11:24.892
(screaming)

11:26.072 --> 11:27.400
Oh, gosh.

Aww, he's resting

He won't die, right?

11:58.647 --> 12:01.245
It's illegal to kill
squirrels in the Ukraine.

12:01.447 --> 12:04.595
Ever since Putin had
them trained as spies.

12:04.976 --> 12:07.048
There's an animal hospital nearby.

but I'm in charge now,

12:21.495 --> 12:24.093
and this trip is about
Max meeting her dad,

12:24.192 --> 12:26.079
not saving a squirrel's life.

12:26.127 --> 12:28.115

12:32.220 --> 12:33.620
If this diner's anything like ours,

12:43.799 --> 12:46.189
Makes our trip sound
bigger, doesn't it?

12:47.513 --> 12:49.430
We should plan a march.

13:10.611 --> 13:11.829
I'm pretty hungry.

13:11.892 --> 13:12.763
My donut is covered

13:12.810 --> 13:14.611
in squirrel slobber.

13:15.111 --> 13:16.923
You can't bring outside food in here.

13:17.033 --> 13:18.189
It's not food.

13:18.237 --> 13:20.181
It's a severely injured squirrel.

13:20.244 --> 13:21.548
All right, well, sit wherever.

13:21.596 --> 13:23.478
Just don't let it out of the box.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.309
Do you see that, Earl?

13:25.356 --> 13:27.822
He's firm but fair.

13:31.197 --> 13:33.884
You look like a young Earl.

13:34.056 --> 13:36.277
No, I'm Steve.

13:36.439 --> 13:38.697
That was young Earl's name!

13:42.723 --> 13:44.507
Hey, everybody!

13:45.633 --> 13:49.819
Uh, I'm just going in.

13:52.439 --> 13:54.629
I told your dad to look
for a pretty blonde girl

13:54.676 --> 13:56.340
whose hair is a little
longer than a bob

13:56.387 --> 13:58.189
but shorter than shoulder-length.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.298
Oh, I forgot to tell
him what you look like.

14:01.579 --> 14:03.313
Well, I have no idea
what he looks like.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.454
I always imagined Louis CK,
but not as hot.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.931
Maybe you do have daddy issues.

14:09.064 --> 14:12.283
On the plus side,
we will never like the same guy.

14:13.236 --> 14:15.048
Gary says when Max sees her dad,

14:15.126 --> 14:17.103
she's going to get very emotional.

14:17.228 --> 14:18.439
She could get happy,

14:18.525 --> 14:19.611
then sad.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.853
Basically, hide your forks.

14:22.064 --> 14:23.650
(squirrel chattering) Oh.

14:23.839 --> 14:25.744
He peed again.

14:25.845 --> 14:26.937
Oh, Lord,

14:27.001 --> 14:28.892
am I peeing?

14:29.783 --> 14:32.103
But these are my best pants.

14:32.626 --> 14:36.540
He peed so much, he turned
this donut box into a pool.

14:37.040 --> 14:40.242
He's really putting
the "ew" in cruller.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.978
Max, if you want privacy
when your dad gets here,

14:43.048 --> 14:44.736
I can go sit in that other booth.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.486
Can you do that now?

14:49.470 --> 14:50.822
Look alive, everyone!

It's the moment

14:51.978 --> 14:53.533

14:53.642 --> 14:54.598
At least since Tuesday,

14:54.645 --> 14:56.212
when Gary suggested it.

14:56.392 --> 14:57.954
Then I took over.

14:58.211 --> 15:00.051
Max, make sure you look
at me when you hug him.

15:00.212 --> 15:01.821
Oh, that guy? I hope not.

No daddy, no daddy, no daddy.

15:04.462 --> 15:05.840

15:07.725 --> 15:10.996
arms, legs, face, and overall vibe?

15:11.488 --> 15:12.675
You know it would be bad

and jacking on his own.

he's not going to show.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.981
The night terrors just stopped.

17:01.043 --> 17:02.679
I was terrified of her at night.

17:03.965 --> 17:06.496
You can sleep with a cheap Taser now.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.205
I already do.

For the same reason!

17:10.675 --> 17:11.800

My dad's not coming.

This is Caroline's thing.

17:40.511 --> 17:41.894
Let's just go.

17:42.011 --> 17:43.604
I want to get back before Cinnabon

17:45.324 --> 17:47.504
You know we own a dessert bar, right?

17:47.551 --> 17:49.497
Maybe he's still gonna come.

17:49.544 --> 17:52.209
If I know one thing about
the man I know nothing about,

17:52.312 --> 17:53.444
he is not coming.

17:53.492 --> 17:55.055
Are you disappointed?

17:55.103 --> 17:56.367
No.

17:57.602 --> 17:58.807
A little.

17:58.883 --> 18:01.187
But maybe it's for the
best he didn't come.

18:01.289 --> 18:03.110
This is why I didn't want
to meet him, because whoever

18:03.157 --> 18:05.430
comes through that door
is just gonna disappoint me.

18:05.547 --> 18:07.742
And this way, I get to
imagine he's someone cool,

18:07.859 --> 18:09.116
like Burt Reynolds

18:09.164 --> 18:10.930
or Captain Crunch.

18:11.343 --> 18:13.086
So you're really okay?

18:13.179 --> 18:14.220
Yeah.

18:14.305 --> 18:15.352
We had a great day.

She's hurt, and she's family to me.

18:40.497 --> 18:42.150
How does that make me feel?

18:42.231 --> 18:45.294
Like I should have gone
to an out-of-network doctor!

18:45.497 --> 18:49.005

and I'll give you 40 bucks.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.442
Throw in a joint, and we have a deal.

19:17.583 --> 19:18.855
Maybe you are my dad.

19:18.903 --> 19:20.591
Oh, no, I don't have kids.

19:20.794 --> 19:21.832
Too much pot.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.024
(laughs)

19:23.161 --> 19:25.599
Guys, this is my dad.

19:27.911 --> 19:30.356
I'm the hot girl's dad.

19:30.786 --> 19:32.782
Was anyone else expecting a cop?

19:33.036 --> 19:35.935
I mean, you know, for the irony.

19:37.185 --> 19:38.645
I'm Caroline.

19:38.739 --> 19:40.044
See, it's, like, not a bob,

19:40.122 --> 19:41.638
but it's not shoulder-length.

19:41.692 --> 19:43.661
I'm responsible for this reunion.

19:43.733 --> 19:45.155
Um, he's not really my dad.

19:45.202 --> 19:46.822
I'm doing this for Han.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.338
All right, everybody.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.572
Uh, my dad and I have had

19:50.666 --> 19:51.962
a heartwarming reunion,

19:52.048 --> 19:56.188
and now he has to get
to a secret mission.

19:56.336 --> 19:58.454
In an exotic locale.

19:58.569 --> 19:59.954
Sure.

20:01.009 --> 20:02.438
But I can't leave the county.

20:02.519 --> 20:05.704
Sure. Local secret mission.

20:06.610 --> 20:08.712
Hey, you seem like a nice kid.

20:09.009 --> 20:11.204
Your father should be proud.

20:11.485 --> 20:13.431
Thanks.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.852
Sorry about the outburst, Gary.

20:15.978 --> 20:19.423
You know it stems from my
mother's expectations.

20:19.665 --> 20:22.697
(exhales) Thanks for doing this, Han.

20:23.116 --> 20:25.595
Anyone in the hug business?

20:28.314 --> 20:29.699
I didn't even flinch.

20:29.746 --> 20:31.907
We are making progress.

20:32.345 --> 20:33.345
You coming, Earl?

20:33.393 --> 20:34.329
Sure am.

20:34.377 --> 20:35.336
Don't want to get stuck

20:35.384 --> 20:37.823
being a cashier my whole life.

20:39.624 --> 20:43.493
SOPHIE: Oleg, you
forgot the damn squirrel.

20:46.053 --> 20:47.876
Come on, little guy.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.606
We don't abandon anybody.
