34:45.419 --> 34:49.548

34:49.548 --> 34:52.509

34:52.509 --> 34:53.927
Um, and now...

34:53.927 --> 34:56.430

34:56.430 --> 34:58.557
as opposed to the typical reverse,

34:58.557 --> 35:00.392

women take clothes off for men,

35:00.392 --> 35:04.146
and men put money in their panties.

35:04.146 --> 35:06.857
But in this situation,

35:06.857 --> 35:10.736
it's the men that are getting
the money in their panties.

from them, or water,

35:25.834 --> 35:29.713

35:29.713 --> 35:31.882
Um, and you know, everybody has key chains

35:31.882 --> 35:35.177
because keys are required
to enter your domicile,

35:35.177 --> 35:38.013

be financially lucrative

35:38.013 --> 35:40.140

who women like to see naked?
