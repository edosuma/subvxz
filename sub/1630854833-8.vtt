WEBVTT

00:40.475 --> 00:48.526
<i>Intruder alert.
All units respond.</i>

01:17.164 --> 01:21.081
And we are done.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.649
What do you think?
Think Nora's gonna like it?

01:24.649 --> 01:29.567
Well, you can ask her
yourself in seven months.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.439
I know. I know.
I'm jumping the gun.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.136
I just--I can't wait
to be a dad.

01:33.136 --> 01:34.572
Is that why there's a freezer

01:34.572 --> 01:36.487
full of cookie dough ice cream?

01:36.487 --> 01:37.967
That's Nora's favorite.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.969
- Yeah, when she's 23.
- Yeah.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.666
Ooh, you know what I could
go for right now

01:41.666 --> 01:43.233
is some of that--

01:43.233 --> 01:45.366
Vanilla bean
from that organic dairy farm

01:45.366 --> 01:47.237
in Coast City?

01:47.237 --> 01:50.371
Yes.
- Yeah.

01:50.371 --> 01:53.896
Actually, that reminds me...
for you.

01:59.902 --> 02:02.644
No way.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.602
Iris, this is
in mint condition.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.387
How did you find this?
I've been looking for a copy

02:06.387 --> 02:08.040
ever since I lost my dad's
as a kid.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.955
Enjoy.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.827
I mean, I can't believe
you did this.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.481
I mentioned it once
six months ago.

02:13.481 --> 02:16.310
And that's how we do, boo.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.399
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.882
I gotta go.
I scheduled a mold inspection

02:23.882 --> 02:25.493
so it was safe to bring Nora
to work with us.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.059
But is having a stranger

02:27.059 --> 02:28.452
wandering around S.T.A.R. Labs
a good idea?

02:28.452 --> 02:29.801
I mean,
the Starchives are sealed,

02:29.801 --> 02:31.499
and I had Chester
and Khione store

02:31.499 --> 02:33.631
all the other Team Flash stuff
in the Time Vault.

02:33.631 --> 02:35.459
Well, just make sure
you bring me

02:35.459 --> 02:37.157
some of Cecile's
leftover casserole.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.593
Done deal.
See you in a few hours.

02:38.593 --> 02:39.724
All right.

02:45.295 --> 02:48.646
Trust me.
I know Carla Tannhauser.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.300
You have nothing
to worry about.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.346
But I don't know her.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.652
Don't get me wrong, I'm touched
that she wants to meet me,

02:54.652 --> 02:56.306
but I'm not her daughter.

02:56.306 --> 02:58.221
Well, neither was Frost,
and Carla loved her

02:58.221 --> 02:59.962
the same as she loved Caitlin.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.833
She probably just wants
to get to know you better.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.227
What if I say something wrong

03:04.227 --> 03:05.489
and then things get awkward?

03:05.489 --> 03:07.578
She might walk out...

03:07.578 --> 03:09.798
like Mark did.

03:11.887 --> 03:15.586
Look, Khione, I know how much
it must have hurt

03:15.586 --> 03:17.719
having Mark walk out on you,

03:17.719 --> 03:21.940
and I don't know how things
are gonna go with Carla.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.378
Just go and have coffee.

03:24.378 --> 03:27.119
See what happens.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.209
I just got an alert
that the mold inspector

03:29.209 --> 03:30.340
checked in with security.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.863
Great.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.038
You sure you don't want us
to stick around?

03:33.038 --> 03:35.215
No, it's your day off. Relax.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.393
I'm the Flash.

03:39.393 --> 03:42.004
I'm pretty sure I can handle
one mold inspector.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.716
- Mr. Allen, I take it?
- Yes.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.805
Are you all here to find mold?

04:00.805 --> 04:03.068
Negative, broseph.
Mold's my turf.

04:03.068 --> 04:04.505
But when you hit me up...

04:04.505 --> 04:06.637
It alerted Code Enforcement.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.857
This lab's operating permits
haven't been renewed

04:08.857 --> 04:11.425
since your infamous
particle accelerator exploded.

04:11.425 --> 04:12.861
- Oh.
- That's why we'll be

04:12.861 --> 04:15.211
conducting a full
DOE inspection today.

04:15.211 --> 04:18.432
Okay.

04:18.432 --> 04:20.738
What are you looking for
besides mold?

04:20.738 --> 04:23.088
I'll be measuring
and studying any device energy

04:23.088 --> 04:27.615
or matter that emits
ionized radiation or particles.

04:27.615 --> 04:29.443
It looks like you have
a lot of that around here.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.358
- Yeah, well--
- And I'm here to check out

04:31.358 --> 04:33.098
all of your electrical.

04:35.492 --> 04:38.234
Sure--yeah, I guess
let's get started, then.

04:38.234 --> 04:39.801
Oh, hi...

04:39.801 --> 04:41.455
- Hi.
- Everybody.

04:41.455 --> 04:44.414
Ooh. That smells delicious.

04:44.414 --> 04:45.807
I'm sorry, and you are?

04:45.807 --> 04:47.417
Hungry.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.897
And you are?

04:48.897 --> 04:50.246
Inspector Howard.

04:50.246 --> 04:52.030
Inspector Howard,
this is my wife,

04:52.030 --> 04:53.989
Iris West-Allen.

04:53.989 --> 04:56.513
She's here.
- Fantastic.

04:56.513 --> 04:57.601
Can we start now?

04:57.601 --> 04:59.603
Sure.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.344
You know what,
just straight down this hall

05:01.344 --> 05:04.695
to the Speed Lab,
two lefts and a right.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.741
I'll be with you in a minute.

05:06.741 --> 05:10.397
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.789
My bad.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.791
I thought you were
resting at home.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.011
Oh, um, yeah.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.839
I just--I couldn't wait
for my casserole.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.406
- Ah.
- Yeah.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.364
So what's up
with the City Hall gang?

05:21.364 --> 05:23.540
Apparently,
a mold inspection triggers

05:23.540 --> 05:25.760
every other
city inspection too,

05:25.760 --> 05:28.763
which is way more prying eyes
than I expected.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.504
Let me help.

05:30.504 --> 05:33.681
No, look, I know people
like this chief guy,

05:33.681 --> 05:36.031
and he's just itching
for a reason to shut us down.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.467
I can tell.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.295
You sure you don't mind?
I mean--

05:39.295 --> 05:42.385
Handling bureaucratic
jackassery is, like, my thing.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.256
- Okay.
- We got this.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.564
Mr. Allen.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.914
Inspector, sir.

05:59.924 --> 06:01.622
Oh!

06:01.622 --> 06:03.841
Whoa, whoo!

06:03.841 --> 06:07.367
Oh.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.153
No mold up there, man.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.676
Oh.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.025
- Could've told him that.
- Great.

06:14.025 --> 06:15.940
- Whoo!
- Is this ramp used

06:15.940 --> 06:18.116
for declivity
or purely entertainment?

06:18.116 --> 06:19.814
Oh...

06:19.814 --> 06:21.729
- Both?
- Both.

06:21.729 --> 06:24.993
So your thing with
the electrical stuff in it?

06:24.993 --> 06:28.300
Thing with all the elec--
uh, the breaker box?

06:28.300 --> 06:30.607
Right, the breaker box.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.174
Breaker--it's in the--

06:32.174 --> 06:34.785
What's a Speed Lab for, anyway?

06:34.785 --> 06:36.483
Oh, well--

06:36.483 --> 06:38.963
You know, it's crazy
'cause we--

06:38.963 --> 06:40.835
as big as this place is,
we actually really don't spend

06:40.835 --> 06:42.489
a lot of time in here, right?

06:42.489 --> 06:43.968
- Hardly ever.
- Hardly ever.

06:43.968 --> 06:47.494
So I feel like
we should just move on.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.104
Yeah?

06:49.104 --> 06:51.802
Yeah.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.064
Fine.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.284
- Yeah?
- Let's go, folks.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.025
Let's go, folks.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.899
Electrician's unusual.

07:01.899 --> 07:04.075
Yeah, if you ask me,
they all seem like

07:04.075 --> 07:06.034
characters from a sitcom.

07:06.034 --> 07:08.166
"Inspectors,"
coming this fall.

07:11.779 --> 07:15.870
Okay, breaker box is
just right over here.

07:24.792 --> 07:27.011
We just left this room.

07:27.011 --> 07:29.753
What are you trying to pull?

07:29.753 --> 07:32.756
We...

07:32.756 --> 07:35.063
we must have
taken a wrong turn.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.978
In your own facility?

07:36.978 --> 07:40.285
Okay, this is super trippy.

07:40.285 --> 07:41.852
Not sure I would have
phrased it that way,

07:41.852 --> 07:43.724
but I concur.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.073
Allen, I hate shenanigans.

07:45.073 --> 07:46.204
If this is
some kind of a joke--

07:46.204 --> 07:48.163
Joke? No. No.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.295
Barry's not even a funny guy,
like, at all.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.993
I mean, this stuff happens
all the time, right?

07:51.993 --> 07:53.690
I mean, this place is so big,
we get lost in here,

07:53.690 --> 07:55.518
what, once, twice a day?

07:55.518 --> 07:57.041
Yeah, or every
couple of hours.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.565
Every couple of hours.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.784
- It's a real labyrinth.
- It's a real labyrinth.

08:00.784 --> 08:03.134
So...

08:03.134 --> 08:04.571
Yeah, it's just here.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.963
- Yes.
- Sorry. Excuse me.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.269
I'll just squeeze
right by you.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.966
Here we go. Yeah.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.710
Okay, so sorry about that.

08:13.710 --> 08:14.929
Here we go. Just--

08:18.106 --> 08:20.195
You've gotta be kidding me.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.502
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.984
All right, what in
the H-E-double hockey sticks

08:26.984 --> 08:30.031
is going on here?

08:30.031 --> 08:33.513
Honestly, no idea.

08:35.036 --> 08:36.254
Don't look at me.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.387
Don't know.

08:38.387 --> 08:41.782
Whoa, was that there before?

08:48.832 --> 08:50.399
No.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.314
I have excellent
spatial retention.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.664
I can say with near certainty

08:54.664 --> 08:58.581
that grandfather clock was
not here before.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.365
Barry,

09:00.365 --> 09:03.499
how did a grandfather clock
get into the Speed Lab?

09:03.499 --> 09:05.196
I don't know.

09:05.196 --> 09:07.068
And why can't we get
out of this room?

09:07.068 --> 09:08.765
I don't know.

09:21.865 --> 09:25.913
This would fetch a lot
at the "Antiques Roadshow."

09:25.913 --> 09:30.482
It's from the 19th century, only...

09:30.482 --> 09:32.876
it looks like
it was built yesterday.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.837
I don't know
why you're playing a prank,

09:36.837 --> 09:39.840
but I know how.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.450
Clearly there are
two identical labs

09:41.450 --> 09:43.887
in this immediate vicinity.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.761
You got us.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.545
- Ha!
- That's right.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.068
You know what,
can we just have a second?

09:51.068 --> 09:52.809
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll be right back. Okay.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.202
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.509
Barry.
- Hmm?

09:57.509 --> 09:58.989
What the hell's going on?

09:58.989 --> 10:00.338
And what's up
with the rando antique?

10:00.338 --> 10:02.036
I don't know. I don't know.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.255
I'm trying to call the team.
I can't get a signal.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.909
It's like we're cut off
from the rest of the world.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.781
Okay, first a time loop,
and then Mia and I are

10:07.781 --> 10:09.173
stuck in a dream, and now this?

10:09.173 --> 10:10.784
Maybe it's
some kind of illusion.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.350
I mean, there's at least
a dozen metas that have

10:12.350 --> 10:13.787
the ability to create one
this powerful.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.702
Except, I don't know,
this doesn't feel

10:15.702 --> 10:17.138
like an attack or an illusion.

10:17.138 --> 10:18.705
I know.
Okay, but don't worry.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.620
We're gonna find a way out.
It's what we do.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.186
Can we hurry,

10:22.186 --> 10:24.449
because our future speedster
needs a snack.

10:24.449 --> 10:26.147
- That's it?
- What?

10:26.147 --> 10:28.366
That's it. That's it.
I'll run to the future.

10:28.366 --> 10:29.846
I can find out how we escaped.
- No.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.456
And then I can run back
and fix it.

10:31.456 --> 10:32.936
No, Barry, I don't know.
I think we should

10:32.936 --> 10:34.938
think this through
and weigh our options

10:34.938 --> 10:36.287
before you start
zooming through time.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.854
Iris, it's not just about us.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.987
It's about Nora now too.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.728
Whatever's happening
has just started,

10:41.728 --> 10:43.207
but it's gonna escalate fast.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.426
It always does.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.862
That's why my gut is telling me

10:45.862 --> 10:48.952
those people in there are
in real danger.

10:48.952 --> 10:52.826
Isn't yours telling you
the same thing?

10:52.826 --> 10:55.045
Fine.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.873
Just make sure you bring me
back a decent snack

10:56.873 --> 10:58.353
from the future.
- Okay.

10:58.353 --> 11:02.705
Something with pistachios.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.359
♪ You got a Z ♪

11:04.359 --> 11:06.187
♪ We got an A ♪

11:06.187 --> 11:08.798
♪ And what else,
'cause za's not a word ♪

11:08.798 --> 11:11.105
Yeah, it is. Za, like pizza.

11:11.105 --> 11:13.716
Pizza, pizza, pizza!

11:13.716 --> 11:15.849
- Girl, you did not just echo.
- I echoed.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.633
- You are my favorite human.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.722
But za is not a word.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.463
Why would you say za
instead of pizza?

11:21.463 --> 11:25.336
Pizza just feels good
when you say "pizza."

11:25.336 --> 11:29.036
What's wrong?

11:29.036 --> 11:30.864
You know when I went all nova

11:30.864 --> 11:32.561
at O'Shaughnessy's
a couple weeks ago?

11:36.347 --> 11:38.045
Of course I do.
You were so badass.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.568
Thanks.

11:39.568 --> 11:42.527
Well, now social media
is buzzing

11:42.527 --> 11:44.834
with descriptions
of a new light meta,

11:44.834 --> 11:48.751
descriptions that sound
exactly like me.

11:48.751 --> 11:53.451
Chuck, what if
everyone finds out?

11:53.451 --> 11:58.848
I mean, well, then you'll be
the new celebrity superhero.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.720
I mean, that could be fun.
Think about it.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.548
The mayor would probably invite
you to some fancy parties.

12:03.548 --> 12:05.637
You get to hobnob
with the in crowd.

12:05.637 --> 12:08.249
I don't wanna hobnob
with anyone but you.

12:08.249 --> 12:11.208
I like hobnobbing
with you too.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.993
I mean, hey, look,
let's be real.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.996
You are the most incredible
person I've ever met.

12:15.996 --> 12:19.608
And I have no idea how I got
so lucky as to end up

12:19.608 --> 12:22.219
with someone who's so far
out of my league,

12:22.219 --> 12:23.699
but I'm not even gonna ask
that question

12:23.699 --> 12:25.832
'cause all I know
is that I love you

12:25.832 --> 12:29.270
and you mean the world to... me.

12:34.231 --> 12:38.148
I didn't mean that.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.802
No, I definitely did mean it.
I love you a lot.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.673
And I don't know
why I said it again.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.327
What is wrong with me?
I need to stop talking.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.199
Okay, now you talk.

12:45.199 --> 12:48.898
I--

12:48.898 --> 12:51.161
Oh, hey, guys.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.904
Look at you two lovebirds.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.384
You are just
the cutest thing ever.

12:56.384 --> 12:57.994
Okay, don't mind me.
I am not looking.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.779
I see nothing.
I'm going upstairs.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.304
No, no, no, no, don't.
Stay. Join us.

13:03.304 --> 13:06.655
With three of us, we can play
"Settlers of Catan."

13:08.396 --> 13:10.354
But what about
our "Scrabble" game?

13:10.354 --> 13:11.791
Let's be real.
You were letting me win.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.140
Za's probably not a word.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.358
Do the settlers come
with wine,

13:14.358 --> 13:15.446
'cause I like wine.

13:15.446 --> 13:16.578
- Yes.
- Yay.

13:16.578 --> 13:17.971
Wine. I'll get us wine.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.146
Yay.

13:21.235 --> 13:24.847
Are you guys okay?

13:24.847 --> 13:26.762
- Yes.
- Yeah.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.291
Where's Mr. Allen?

13:34.291 --> 13:35.771
The bathroom.

13:35.771 --> 13:39.296
He's gonna be a while.
Quite a while.

13:41.168 --> 13:44.258
What's that sound?

13:44.258 --> 13:46.129
Uh, I'm starving.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.175
Is anybody else hungry?
I'm buying.

14:01.579 --> 14:04.234
Dude, what was that?

14:14.114 --> 14:16.464
Uh, another prank!

14:20.163 --> 14:21.251
Gotcha.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.818
Okay, I've had enough.

14:22.818 --> 14:25.603
Johnson, you can come out now!

14:25.603 --> 14:26.909
- Who's Johnson?
- Your accomplice.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.476
Johnson from division.

14:28.476 --> 14:29.956
He called ahead, didn't he?
That little...

14:29.956 --> 14:31.174
- Yeah.
- Prankster.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.436
I'm on to you, Johnson!

14:42.446 --> 14:44.971
Okay, this is bad.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.668
- "Star Wars"?
- Oh, I'll say.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.844
You think you're so funny

14:48.844 --> 14:50.498
to mock the guy
who likes sci-fi, huh?

14:50.498 --> 14:52.630
I'll tell you something
that's funny, okay?

14:52.630 --> 14:56.460
S.T.A.R. Labs is getting
an F minus

14:56.460 --> 14:58.245
for how funny you are!

14:58.245 --> 15:00.421
Sir, we have
a larger problem.

15:14.826 --> 15:17.960
Why can't I just go home
and feed my parakeets?

15:17.960 --> 15:20.180
Okay, this is seriously
freaking me out.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.486
Are we in danger?

15:22.486 --> 15:24.793
Um...

15:24.793 --> 15:28.318
Johnson isn't behind this.

15:28.318 --> 15:29.406
Is he?

15:29.406 --> 15:31.495
No, he's not.

15:31.495 --> 15:34.281
How do you know,
and why should we trust you?

15:44.030 --> 15:46.075
Because I'm the Flash.

15:46.075 --> 15:50.210
And whatever's going on here,
it's definitely not good.

15:50.210 --> 15:53.953
Okay, that makes sense.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.173
You know what?

15:57.173 --> 15:59.088
Oh!

16:07.053 --> 16:10.012
Dude, you really are
the Flash.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.493
I've never met
a superhero before.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.366
I know that we're
in a situation here,

16:16.366 --> 16:19.239
but if we get out of this,
I would love to study

16:19.239 --> 16:21.589
some of your
quantum biochemistry sometime.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.721
If we get out?

16:23.721 --> 16:25.767
No. Are we gonna die?

16:25.767 --> 16:27.812
Oh, man. No.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.032
- Hey, nobody is gonna die.
- No.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.642
No, we just need to figure out

16:31.642 --> 16:35.124
why these objects keep
showing up.

16:35.124 --> 16:37.735
I have a theory about that.

16:37.735 --> 16:42.001
Imagine this is all space-time.

16:42.001 --> 16:46.048
Normally, it flows
and stretches like this.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.791
We move from one room,
one moment to the next,

16:49.791 --> 16:51.401
but we can't do that.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.142
We're stuck.

16:53.142 --> 16:57.190
Because space and time
for us has lost elasticity.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.366
It's like some kind
of gravitational force

16:59.366 --> 17:01.411
is creating a zone
that we can't escape from

17:01.411 --> 17:04.501
and pulling objects
out of time too.

17:04.501 --> 17:07.417
It's called a time magnet.

17:10.072 --> 17:12.683
I really like
science fiction, so...

17:12.683 --> 17:16.383
When I was doing research
for the map book,

17:16.383 --> 17:18.863
I found out
that 100 years from now,

17:18.863 --> 17:20.996
a weapons vault would be
right here.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.563
Let me guess:
one of those weapons

17:22.563 --> 17:24.217
will be a time magnet.

17:24.217 --> 17:26.523
Why is it here now
and not in the future?

17:26.523 --> 17:29.265
Unknown, but in order
to prevent the temporal anomaly

17:29.265 --> 17:30.875
that we're stuck in
from happening,

17:30.875 --> 17:32.964
this future weapons vault
would have paired

17:32.964 --> 17:35.141
the time magnet
with some kind of stabilizer.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.621
So whoever brought
the magnet with them

17:37.621 --> 17:40.885
from the past forgot to bring
the stabilizer with them?

17:43.149 --> 17:45.020
Maybe they were in a hurry.

17:45.020 --> 17:48.850
Why would they be in a hurry?

17:48.850 --> 17:50.939
Because they were
stealing it.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.723
Think about it,
it could be a thief,

17:52.723 --> 17:56.205
a time thief trying to escape
their past to get away.

17:56.205 --> 17:57.685
Now hold on.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.208
We haven't seen
anybody come through here

17:59.208 --> 18:01.297
except for the people
in this room.

18:01.297 --> 18:04.344
You're right.

18:04.344 --> 18:09.740
So that means that somebody
in this room is a...

18:09.740 --> 18:10.828
thief.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.185
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.838
Jane, is there any way
to find out

18:20.838 --> 18:22.492
if someone is from
a different time?

18:22.492 --> 18:24.233
Theoretically,
a time traveler might

18:24.233 --> 18:26.627
give off excess radiation,

18:26.627 --> 18:28.803
and we have
a radiation scanner.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.761
Okay.

18:30.761 --> 18:34.504
Well, let's test that theory.

18:44.862 --> 18:46.821
Well, I guess I can't go,

18:46.821 --> 18:48.997
which means it's your turn, Allegra,

18:48.997 --> 18:50.781
and by the looks of it,
you have

18:50.781 --> 18:55.046
enough lumber and brick
to build two roads.

18:55.046 --> 18:58.485
Which means you have
the longest road.

19:00.051 --> 19:02.228
Which means I win, I think.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.925
- Mm.
- Oh! Yay.

19:03.925 --> 19:06.406
You know,
the thing about roads is,

19:06.406 --> 19:08.756
when you go down a road,
you can always come back.

19:08.756 --> 19:10.192
You just turn around

19:10.192 --> 19:13.848
and go back
to where you started...

19:13.848 --> 19:16.067
or where we started.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.334
You know,
I have some legal briefs

19:21.334 --> 19:22.726
upstairs that I need
to work on,

19:22.726 --> 19:23.901
so I'm just gonna
mosey on upstairs--

19:23.901 --> 19:25.207
No, don't.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.774
Best two out of three.

19:26.774 --> 19:29.037
Right?

19:29.037 --> 19:31.039
It's okay, Allegra.

19:31.039 --> 19:33.955
I'll just--I'll just go.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.703
Okay,
now that Chester's gone,

19:42.703 --> 19:44.748
you wanna tell me
what happened?

19:46.924 --> 19:49.884
]

19:56.499 --> 19:59.633
Hmm.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.156
Clear.

20:04.899 --> 20:07.249
You seem to know
a lot about this, Jane.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.120
Maybe you're the time thief.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.731
I am the only one
in this room

20:10.731 --> 20:13.995
with the mathematical expertise.

20:13.995 --> 20:17.520
I suppose it is possible
that time travel induces

20:17.520 --> 20:20.480
temporary amnesia
such that I could be

20:20.480 --> 20:22.395
the time thief
without remembering.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.626
You're clear too, Jane.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.209
Clear.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.909
Wow.

20:58.909 --> 21:01.521
Look, I'm not
some kind of time traveler.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.784
This is a ruse,

21:03.784 --> 21:06.613
a distraction to cover
for your broken facility!

21:06.613 --> 21:08.136
And when I get out of here,
I am report--

21:10.530 --> 21:11.748
What is it?

21:11.748 --> 21:14.229
Howard, what is it?

21:26.067 --> 21:28.199
Oh, God.

21:28.199 --> 21:31.115
He's a statue.

21:31.115 --> 21:32.856
We're all gonna be statues.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.815
He's not a statue.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.643
He's dead.
- De--

21:36.643 --> 21:38.514
Scattered through time
and space in a collection

21:38.514 --> 21:40.516
of free-floating
subatomic particles.

21:40.516 --> 21:43.954
So he was erased
and replaced with a statue?

21:43.954 --> 21:47.088
It's the law
of conservation of matter.

21:47.088 --> 21:51.005
If we don't all get out
of here soon, we're next.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.404
Okay, I'm freaking out, man.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.493
This is--this is way too heavy.

22:00.493 --> 22:01.885
Everybody stay calm.

22:01.885 --> 22:03.626
Flash, you gotta save us.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.672
I don't wanna become a creepy
nude dude made of stone.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.151
Poor Chief Howard.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.980
What could have caused that
to happen?

22:09.980 --> 22:12.156
She did it.

22:12.156 --> 22:13.332
Mrs. Flash?

22:13.332 --> 22:14.811
Seriously?
- Me?

22:14.811 --> 22:16.204
I didn't even get
a chance to scan him.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.988
Why should we believe you?

22:17.988 --> 22:19.773
Maybe the scanner did something
you're not aware of.

22:19.773 --> 22:21.470
She's right.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.298
I need to run
through some more equations.

22:23.298 --> 22:24.908
I think better when I'm running
through the variables.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.258
- Be my guest.
- Why did I come to work today?

22:27.258 --> 22:29.957
I could have stayed home,
watched some cartoons.

22:29.957 --> 22:32.263
Look, we both know
you didn't cause

22:32.263 --> 22:34.004
whatever happened to Howard,
which means it has to be

22:34.004 --> 22:35.876
something else,
something we haven't seen yet.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.660
Okay, well, we need to figure
out what that is and fast.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.532
Otherwise--
- I know.

22:39.532 --> 22:42.491
Bad taste in clothing will be
the least of our concerns.

22:45.538 --> 22:49.106
Okay, I'm all ears.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.108
Chester told me he loves me.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.676
What? I knew it!

22:53.676 --> 22:55.548
You guys have been making
the "I'm about to say it" eyes

22:55.548 --> 22:59.595
at each other for so long,
and you finally did it.

22:59.595 --> 23:01.162
Am I confused?

23:01.162 --> 23:03.294
Do you not feel
the same way about him?

23:03.294 --> 23:05.035
I love him so much it hurts.

23:05.035 --> 23:07.255
Aww! Then what's the problem?

23:07.255 --> 23:08.735
He loves you. You love him.

23:08.735 --> 23:11.825
Just say it back
and get to the good stuff.

23:11.825 --> 23:17.352
Cecile, you know what happens
to people that I love.

23:17.352 --> 23:21.878
They leave or worse,
like Nash and Esperanza.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.591
Allegra, I can't even imagine
how tough that was

23:38.591 --> 23:42.595
for you to go through,
but Chester,

23:42.595 --> 23:46.860
if he loves you,
he's not gonna leave.

23:48.339 --> 23:49.863
It's the same thing
my dad said

23:49.863 --> 23:52.300
right before he bailed
on me and my mom,

23:52.300 --> 23:53.823
and she said it too,

23:53.823 --> 23:55.999
right before she kicked me
out of the house.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.697
I'm sorry.

23:57.697 --> 24:01.570
I don't want to care
for someone like that

24:01.570 --> 24:04.530
and then have them leave,
not again.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.706
I don't think
I could handle it.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.621
I understand.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.971
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.755
One failed marriage over here,

24:12.755 --> 24:15.105
thank you very much.

24:15.105 --> 24:17.020
You never talk about it.

24:17.020 --> 24:20.284
Because it sucked.

24:20.284 --> 24:24.158
But, Allegra, you are not
gonna lose Chester,

24:24.158 --> 24:27.074
and besides,
God forbid you guys break up,

24:27.074 --> 24:30.120
that's, like,
way in the future.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.035
See? It could happen.

24:32.035 --> 24:35.604
It could happen.
You could also get married.

24:35.604 --> 24:38.477
Don't freak out!

24:38.477 --> 24:40.957
My point is,

24:40.957 --> 24:44.570
right now, in this moment,

24:44.570 --> 24:46.049
you are falling in love.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.398
Everything that
you're worried about,

24:47.398 --> 24:50.358
that's way off in the future.

24:50.358 --> 24:54.667
This moment is magical,

24:54.667 --> 24:59.323
so why don't you just be in it?

24:59.323 --> 25:02.849
Give it everything you've got
and enjoy every second of it,

25:02.849 --> 25:05.939
because if there's one thing
that I know,

25:05.939 --> 25:07.854
it's that
what you and Chester have,

25:07.854 --> 25:11.814
it is something special.

25:15.992 --> 25:17.907
I don't get it.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.692
There's no pattern
to anything that's happening.

25:19.692 --> 25:21.389
Except for the fact
that we're about to be

25:21.389 --> 25:23.434
erased from time along with
two more innocent lives.

25:23.434 --> 25:25.567
Oh, my God.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.569
I'm sorry.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.702
I never should have tried
to open the Speed Force tunnel.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.660
No, Barry, I'm sorry.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.401
My thief detection plan got

25:33.401 --> 25:35.446
Chief Inspector Howard atomized.

25:35.446 --> 25:39.015
Iris, running to the future,
again, when it never works--

25:39.015 --> 25:42.105
I should know that by now,
but it doesn't stop me

25:42.105 --> 25:47.241
from building a crib
seven months in advance.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.727
Well, it's not like
I'm any better.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.990
Barry, I think I'm in denial

25:56.990 --> 26:00.776
about how different
things are becoming,

26:00.776 --> 26:03.736
and... I don't know,

26:03.736 --> 26:05.346
I think I'm worried
that I'm not gonna be able

26:05.346 --> 26:08.567
to do the things
that I used to.

26:08.567 --> 26:12.527
Iris, just 'cause you might
have to slow down a bit

26:12.527 --> 26:14.355
for your pregnancy,
it doesn't mean

26:14.355 --> 26:16.575
you're never gonna get to do
the things you love again.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.229
Yeah, I know, but, Barry,
it's like

26:19.229 --> 26:23.973
everything is changing,
and I can't stop it.

26:23.973 --> 26:27.150
Like my body.

26:27.150 --> 26:30.545
Barry, I can feel it changing.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.808
And I'm tired
all the time now too,

26:32.808 --> 26:35.158
and I just wanna eat
everything in sight

26:35.158 --> 26:37.944
and I have a pregnancy brain,
and it's like where you just--

26:37.944 --> 26:39.728
you talk about things
that you said,

26:39.728 --> 26:41.251
and then the next second
you don't even remember

26:41.251 --> 26:42.949
what you've said.

26:42.949 --> 26:44.690
I'm sorry.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.867
I can only imagine
how tough it is.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.259
Baby, I don't want you
to think

26:49.259 --> 26:50.696
that I regret getting pregnant.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.785
It's just...

26:52.785 --> 26:55.222
sometimes I wish I could
go back to my old self.

27:01.663 --> 27:04.187
What?

27:04.187 --> 27:05.798
It's like
I'm stuck in the past,

27:05.798 --> 27:07.669
and you're racing
to the future.

27:09.976 --> 27:12.456
And now I just want
some cookie dough ice cream.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.545
I think you mean
vanilla bean.

27:14.545 --> 27:17.287
Yeah. See? Pregnancy brain.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.072
It's okay.

27:19.072 --> 27:20.769
I'm sorry.

27:25.992 --> 27:27.341
You're not the only one

27:27.341 --> 27:30.605
that's been getting things
mixed up.

27:30.605 --> 27:33.739
What does that mean?

27:33.739 --> 27:36.437
I know who our time thief is.

27:42.878 --> 27:46.403
Okay, look, we're really
sorry that this is happening,

27:46.403 --> 27:50.930
but we both promise you that
we will get you out of here.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.627
Thanks, Mrs. Flash.

27:52.627 --> 27:54.194
So, look,
Iris and I discussed it,

27:54.194 --> 27:55.761
and we think we know

27:55.761 --> 27:57.458
what might be
causing all this to happen.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.199
Really?

27:59.199 --> 28:01.636
Yeah, the Speed Lab is
where I carry out experiments

28:01.636 --> 28:05.118
as the Flash, so it's possible
this room is flooded

28:05.118 --> 28:06.815
with temporal particles.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.730
What does that
have to do with anything?

28:08.730 --> 28:10.601
I'm glad you asked that.

28:10.601 --> 28:13.082
Temporal particles can
become volatile

28:13.082 --> 28:14.997
when exposed
to electrical fields.

28:14.997 --> 28:17.217
- They can?
- Yes.

28:17.217 --> 28:19.132
And since we haven't had
this facility

28:19.132 --> 28:21.003
inspected in nine years,

28:21.003 --> 28:23.049
the wiring
throughout S.T.A.R. Labs

28:23.049 --> 28:26.748
is probably faulty,
including the check valves.

28:29.185 --> 28:32.580
We're glad that you're here,
Inspector Tao.

28:32.580 --> 28:36.062
Could you check those
for us, please?

28:36.062 --> 28:37.933
Yeah, those valves
could be reacting

28:37.933 --> 28:41.241
with random electrical fields,
causing time anomalies.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.851
- Makes sense to me.
- Hold on a minute--

28:42.851 --> 28:46.550
Inspector,
where do you wanna start?

28:46.550 --> 28:49.684
Well, first,
I'll check the wires.

28:49.684 --> 28:52.731
Which ones?

28:52.731 --> 28:57.170
The... red ones.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.999
Then I'll...

28:59.999 --> 29:02.001
Call a plumber,

29:02.001 --> 29:06.962
since check valves guide
water flow, not electricity.

29:06.962 --> 29:08.964
Which you would know
if you were

29:08.964 --> 29:12.098
a real electrical inspector.

29:12.098 --> 29:15.666
You're the time thief.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.233
Prove it.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.148
You didn't know
what a breaker box was.

29:19.148 --> 29:22.891
So your thing with
the electrical stuff in it?

29:22.891 --> 29:24.719
Uh, the breaker box?

29:24.719 --> 29:27.069
Right, um, the breaker box.

29:51.137 --> 29:52.834
- No, no, wait!
- Uh-uh.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.749
We're running out
of time, Flash.

29:54.749 --> 29:57.099
Now help me get
the hell out of here,

29:57.099 --> 29:58.971
or Mrs. Flash gets it next.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.027
Who are you?

30:12.027 --> 30:15.422
Lady Chronos.

30:15.422 --> 30:18.033
The greatest thief
time has ever known.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.382
You know what's happening,
don't you?

30:19.382 --> 30:21.254
We're being erased by time

30:21.254 --> 30:24.300
because of this.

30:28.696 --> 30:30.176
Nice try.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.047
This time magnet has
an identity matrix,

30:32.047 --> 30:35.007
which I reset to my biometrics.

30:35.007 --> 30:38.314
Anyone tries to take it
from me, they go boom.

30:38.314 --> 30:39.838
Yeah.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.797
Now get me out of here
before we all die.

30:42.797 --> 30:45.060
Why don't you just get rid
of the time magnet?

30:45.060 --> 30:46.409
Uh-uh.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.542
This baby is
my retirement score.

30:48.542 --> 30:53.895
With it, I can just relax
on the beach in the Caribbean.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.593
Then when I decide I wanna
steal the Mona Lisa,

30:56.593 --> 31:00.075
all I have to do
is activate this,

31:00.075 --> 31:03.122
and the magnet will
bring it to me instantly.

31:03.122 --> 31:04.601
If you just wanna leave,

31:04.601 --> 31:06.255
why'd you kill Howard
and the others?

31:06.255 --> 31:08.518
I didn't.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.738
The time magnet did.

31:10.738 --> 31:13.175
When I helped Howard up earlier
and he handed me his hat,

31:13.175 --> 31:15.482
<i>he unknowingly brushed
against the magnet</i>

31:15.482 --> 31:17.614
while it was cloaked.

31:17.614 --> 31:20.835
Then 20 minutes later, poof.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.968
You see, the time magnet
is attracting

31:22.968 --> 31:25.274
temporal displacement
particles--

31:25.274 --> 31:27.102
Causing everything
to transmogrify.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.408
Yup.

31:28.408 --> 31:30.018
That's why
when Howard disappeared,

31:30.018 --> 31:34.414
I knew I could use
the magnet as a weapon.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.459
So what's your plan
to get me out of here?

31:36.459 --> 31:38.418
I already tried
to use my speed.

31:38.418 --> 31:41.377
I can't even get myself out,
let alone someone else.

31:41.377 --> 31:43.510
Why don't you just tell us
how you got stuck here

31:43.510 --> 31:44.815
in the first place,
and maybe we can find

31:44.815 --> 31:46.165
a way out of here together?

31:46.165 --> 31:48.167
You probably know
this lab becomes

31:48.167 --> 31:51.039
a Flash museum in the future.

31:51.039 --> 31:53.999
<i>It's defenses
are impenetrable.</i>

31:53.999 --> 31:56.871
<i>But I almost beat them</i>

31:56.871 --> 31:59.482
<i>before security boxed me in.</i>

31:59.482 --> 32:01.484
<i>Then I noticed the lab's
last major inspection</i>

32:01.484 --> 32:06.576
<i>before becoming a museum was
dated today, April 5, 2023.</i>

32:06.576 --> 32:09.318
<i>Fortunately, my chrono-belt
allows me to jump through time</i>

32:09.318 --> 32:10.798
<i>to a single location.</i>

32:14.062 --> 32:16.891
<i>So I used it to travel
back here to the past.</i>

32:18.197 --> 32:21.200
<i>Then all I had to do
was sneak in here</i>

32:21.200 --> 32:23.202
<i>posing as an inspector.</i>

32:23.202 --> 32:26.901
Let's go, folks.

32:26.901 --> 32:29.121
<i>Then I simply traveled back
to 2123,</i>

32:29.121 --> 32:32.776
<i>only this time appearing
inside the weapons vault.</i>

32:32.776 --> 32:34.865
<i>Then I snatched
the time magnet</i>

32:34.865 --> 32:36.345
<i>and came back here
before anyone could</i>

32:36.345 --> 32:38.086
<i>notice I was gone.</i>

32:38.086 --> 32:41.046
<i>After that, I just had
to walk out of here,</i>

32:41.046 --> 32:43.135
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

32:43.135 --> 32:45.137
<i>You were right, Flash.</i>

32:45.137 --> 32:47.139
<i>The magnet's so powerful,
it's attracting objects</i>

32:47.139 --> 32:48.749
<i>throughout time,</i>

32:48.749 --> 32:51.143
<i>trapping us here
in the process.</i>

32:51.143 --> 32:53.884
So what's the solution, speedy?

32:53.884 --> 32:56.322
If your chrono-belt can
transport you through time,

32:56.322 --> 32:58.846
why not just go to 2123,
put the magnet back?

32:58.846 --> 33:00.500
I can't.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.415
My belt lost its charge
after I liberated--

33:02.415 --> 33:04.417
- Stole.
- Permanently borrowed

33:04.417 --> 33:06.985
the time magnet.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.769
The magnet must have
affected it too.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.423
Then let's destroy
the magnet.

33:10.423 --> 33:13.208
Do that and we all get
reduced to subatomic sludge.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.080
If we can't destroy it,
then we need to rejoin

33:15.080 --> 33:17.082
the time magnet
with its stabilizing agent.

33:17.082 --> 33:19.345
Uh-uh, like I said,
parting with my retirement fund

33:19.345 --> 33:20.955
is not an option.

33:20.955 --> 33:22.522
How long do we have
before we all get erased?

33:22.522 --> 33:26.004
I don't know,
but it's gotta be soon.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.875
Unless you have
a rapid rate kinetic generator

33:27.875 --> 33:31.661
hiding somewhere in here,
I can't recharge my belt.

33:38.538 --> 33:40.018
We've got me.

33:42.890 --> 33:46.154
If you wanna survive,
I'm your only choice.

33:55.337 --> 33:58.253
Working with the Flash.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.125
I can't believe this.

34:16.271 --> 34:19.013
Wait.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.624
How do we know
that we can trust you?

34:21.624 --> 34:24.192
I've had the most direct
contact with the magnet,

34:24.192 --> 34:27.195
so my mask can't
protect me much longer.

34:27.195 --> 34:30.285
If I don't restabilize
this thing,

34:30.285 --> 34:32.461
I'll be the first to go.

34:59.445 --> 35:03.579
The second I return this,
I'll be arrested.

35:03.579 --> 35:05.407
At least you'll be alive.

35:18.290 --> 35:21.684
How will we know putting
the time magnet back worked?

35:34.523 --> 35:36.308
She did it.

35:37.831 --> 35:39.441
Time's reset itself.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.182
What about Howard
and the others?

35:41.182 --> 35:44.620
We're right behind you.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.970
Inspector Howard.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.102
You're okay?

35:48.102 --> 35:50.496
No.

35:50.496 --> 35:54.152
Ah, he will be
once the inspection's done.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.762
Exactly.

36:02.377 --> 36:07.600
So first thing, why do you
call this room the Speed Lab?

36:07.600 --> 36:10.777
Why do we call this room
the Speed Lab?

36:10.777 --> 36:13.475
We just really love
the Flash.

36:13.475 --> 36:16.435
Yes.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.567
Yup, he is a really...

36:18.567 --> 36:21.962
- Handsome.
- Nice, handsome guy.

36:21.962 --> 36:23.398
Wouldn't know.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.183
Never met him.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.619
Well...

36:26.619 --> 36:30.579
Okay, people,
you know the drill.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.233
All right, people.

36:32.233 --> 36:34.540
Let's get started.

36:34.540 --> 36:37.891
- Handsome?
- I mean, yeah.

36:41.764 --> 36:43.462
And so you guys have been
stuck in the Speed Lab all day?

36:43.462 --> 36:46.465
Yeah, until the timeline
reset itself

36:46.465 --> 36:48.945
and Howard and all the other
inspectors walked in

36:48.945 --> 36:50.817
like nothing had happened.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.253
And they didn't
remember a thing?

36:52.253 --> 36:54.821
No, they just went back
to their jobs.

36:54.821 --> 36:58.390
So now S.T.A.R. Labs is
officially mold-free.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.914
And one of the safest nuclear
facilities in the world.

37:00.914 --> 37:02.002
Although
I could have told you

37:02.002 --> 37:04.134
you don't have a mold problem.

37:04.134 --> 37:05.440
How?

37:05.440 --> 37:07.616
I don't know. I just can.

37:07.616 --> 37:11.141
Well, we're just glad
we passed the inspection

37:11.141 --> 37:12.317
after everything
that's happened here

37:12.317 --> 37:14.101
in the last nine years.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.640
Let's just say
we were a little concerned.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.729
- Yeah.
- And what about Lady Chronos?

37:33.729 --> 37:35.296
Any chance she got away?

37:35.296 --> 37:38.560
Guess we'll find out
in 100 years.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.867
Hey, how did it go
with you and Carla?

37:40.867 --> 37:42.608
Turns out
she does not want me

37:42.608 --> 37:45.045
to replace her daughters
Caitlin or Frost.

37:45.045 --> 37:47.613
She just wanted
to get to know me as a friend,

37:47.613 --> 37:49.876
and she seems very wise.

37:49.876 --> 37:52.835
You know, as someone who's only
about eight weeks old,

37:52.835 --> 37:56.883
I really could use
a strong female mentor...

37:56.883 --> 37:58.363
and dinner.

37:58.363 --> 38:02.323
Iris, I know you're starving.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.891
How do you--
actually, you know what?

38:04.891 --> 38:06.588
It's already super freaky.
Never mind.

38:06.588 --> 38:09.635
How about we get
dinner for three at Helena's?

38:09.635 --> 38:10.897
- Cheese fries?
- Yeah.

38:10.897 --> 38:12.420
Yes, please.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.335
Sounds amazing.

38:14.335 --> 38:15.989
Do I like cheese fries?

38:15.989 --> 38:18.121
I don't know.
We'll find out.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.477
Hey, Chuck.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.307
Oh, you can't even look at me.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.918
I guess I deserve that.

38:31.918 --> 38:36.270
But I have something
I have to tell you.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.576
Just don't.

38:37.576 --> 38:41.797
I know I messed up, okay?
Big time.

38:41.797 --> 38:46.019
What I said to you earlier,
I was way out of line,

38:46.019 --> 38:47.629
and it was so not fair to you.

38:47.629 --> 38:48.674
Chuck--

38:48.674 --> 38:50.502
I moved way too fast,

38:50.502 --> 38:51.938
and I get why you freaked out.

38:51.938 --> 38:53.722
Anybody would.
- Chuck--

38:53.722 --> 38:56.551
So now you wanna call
the whole thing off, which I--

38:56.551 --> 38:58.945
Chuck, you didn't
mess this up.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.512
I did.

39:00.512 --> 39:03.123
I've been in a lot
of bad relationships,

39:03.123 --> 39:05.778
so it's hard

39:05.778 --> 39:10.043
for me to accept a good one
when it comes along.

39:10.043 --> 39:14.613
Well, not good. Great.

39:16.136 --> 39:18.530
"Great relationship"
as in us?

39:25.188 --> 39:29.018
When you said "I love you,"
the first thing I thought was,

39:29.018 --> 39:32.544
"What if this doesn't work out
or what if I screw it up

39:32.544 --> 39:36.330
and I lose him,"
but that's my baggage,

39:36.330 --> 39:38.201
not yours.

39:38.201 --> 39:41.291
You were worried
about losing me?

39:41.291 --> 39:43.816
Chuck, you're one
of the best things

39:43.816 --> 39:45.818
that's ever happened to me,

39:45.818 --> 39:49.604
and I don't wanna
push you away.

39:49.604 --> 39:53.434
So I guess what I'm trying
to say is...

39:55.393 --> 39:59.005
I love you too.

39:59.005 --> 40:01.268
You do?

40:01.268 --> 40:03.531
Yeah, I just--
I hope I'm not too late.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.577
No.

40:05.577 --> 40:07.579
No, no, definitely not.

40:14.324 --> 40:16.109
Do you wanna go
back to my place?

40:16.109 --> 40:17.632
I do.

40:17.632 --> 40:20.461
I--I definitely do,
but you should know

40:20.461 --> 40:24.900
that I was very sad,
and so I drank,

40:24.900 --> 40:28.469
like, seven Vibe-accinos,
you know,

40:28.469 --> 40:32.081
which means I'll probably be
wide awake for the next,

40:32.081 --> 40:35.781
you know, 10 to 12 hours,
give or take.

40:35.781 --> 40:40.742
Well, good thing we know how
to work off all that energy.

40:42.831 --> 40:45.791
Sorry about that.
Yeah, sounds great.

41:02.677 --> 41:04.940
How could I still be
hungry for dessert?

41:04.940 --> 41:06.942
Do you need help?
I could help you out.

41:06.942 --> 41:08.770
Get your own, pal.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.337
I will.

41:13.471 --> 41:14.994
Just so you know, you now have

41:14.994 --> 41:18.867
a freezer full
of your favorite ice cream.

41:18.867 --> 41:21.304
- Best husband ever.
- Yeah.

41:21.304 --> 41:23.393
Thanks, boo.

41:23.393 --> 41:25.831
So when do you think
Nora develops

41:25.831 --> 41:27.180
her cookie dough craving?

41:27.180 --> 41:29.530
No idea.
But I think I'll wait.

41:29.530 --> 41:32.577
Let her tell us
when she gets here.

41:32.577 --> 41:35.580
Till then,
let's just spend each day

41:35.580 --> 41:38.234
doing what we want to do
in the moment.

41:38.234 --> 41:40.236
To vanilla bean.

41:40.236 --> 41:43.022
And our little bean,
'cause when she gets here,

41:43.022 --> 41:45.807
we're gonna be
on her timetable for...

41:45.807 --> 41:48.288
Ever.

41:48.288 --> 41:50.029
Forever.

41:50.029 --> 41:51.639
Sounds good to me.

41:51.639 --> 41:53.772
Me too.

42:16.098 --> 42:17.447
Greg, move your head.
