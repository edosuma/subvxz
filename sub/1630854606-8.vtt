WEBVTT

00:10.719 --> 00:12.262
[Emily] I'm still in shock.

00:12.345 --> 00:15.140
I should never have texted him, I…
It's all my fault.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.351
Emily, you weren't driving the car.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.021
You can feel as guilty as you want,

00:21.980 --> 00:24.441
but not everything happens
because you make it happen.

00:24.524 --> 00:28.111
Well, except for this.
This was definitely you.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.531
At least this is a peaceful spot.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.868
I bet Pierre is happy here.

00:36.536 --> 00:37.454
He looks happy.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.497
[upbeat music playing]

00:48.423 --> 00:51.092
We were all so worried,
but you look so well.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.928
Yes, swollen in all the right places.

00:54.637 --> 00:57.599
Yeah, he's lucky.
He only suffered a broken collarbone.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.184
I'm so sorry, Pierre.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.062
I hope you don't play any racquet sports.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.313
[chuckles sarcastically]

01:03.396 --> 01:08.234
The injuries you see are minor.
My pain is deeper.

01:08.318 --> 01:12.280
JVMA has taken my brand and mangled it.

01:12.363 --> 01:14.365
The only thing that gives me hope

01:14.449 --> 01:17.619
is knowing
we are all working together again.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.412
-I already have some ideas.
-Pierre--

01:19.496 --> 01:20.705
I know, I know.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.208
It's going to be expensive
to delay the opening.

01:23.708 --> 01:24.542
[Emily] Um…

01:24.626 --> 01:26.628
Has anyone from JVMA been in touch?

01:26.711 --> 01:27.962
Nicolas keeps calling me.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.965
I can't bear
the sound of his voice anymore.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.593
Maybe I can forward them to you.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.179
Pierre, we came here to see how you were.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.472
Not to talk about work.

01:37.555 --> 01:38.598
Yes.

01:38.681 --> 01:42.519
Talking about work
might be very upsetting for you.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.356
Yeah, at least the accident
hasn't gotten out to the press.

01:46.481 --> 01:50.276
That's true. Not a peep on social.
Nobody knows you're here.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.736
And they won't on my watch.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.572
-I'm the soul of discretion.
-[Luc] Well,

01:55.365 --> 01:56.616
you are in good hands.

01:57.117 --> 01:57.951
Eh? [chuckles]

01:58.034 --> 01:58.952
I know I am.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.997
Okay, we'll let you rest.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.043
And stay positive. [chuckles]

02:07.544 --> 02:08.545
I'll be in touch.

02:10.505 --> 02:11.506
So sorry.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.303
[in French] This is terrible.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.264
[in English] This is beyond <i>"terrible."</i>

02:19.347 --> 02:21.850
He has no idea that
we're working for his label, but he's not.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.226
I know.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.061
[upbeat music playing]

02:29.357 --> 02:33.236
Only Pierre Cadault
would be run over and live.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.822
In a horror movie, he's the monster.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.116
Well, he did
sustain some injuries, Gregory,

02:38.199 --> 02:41.119
so we need to treat this
with the sensitivity it deserves.

02:41.202 --> 02:44.414
I don't want to look like
I'm kicking a man while he's down.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.333
But he's done it to me. 2017, anyone?

02:47.417 --> 02:49.377
The paparazzi photo in Italy?

02:49.460 --> 02:52.714
They pointed their cameras
directly at my hotel balcony

02:52.797 --> 02:56.467
while I was enjoying
a little fellatio alfresco.

02:56.551 --> 02:57.677
Well, when in Rome.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.139
[Gregory] And Pierre felt the need
to talk to the press.

03:01.222 --> 03:05.101
He called me Gagory.
And the name stuck.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.313
Look, we both know that you have history,

03:08.396 --> 03:12.358
which is why we just need to take a beat
and figure out how best to handle this.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.359
That's fine.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.655
But let's not forget, you work for me.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.532
Not Pierre.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.951
I'm the only reason you have this account.

03:22.619 --> 03:27.582
So I'm not asking for a pony,
but a little gratitude would be nice.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.088
This does not feel right.

03:34.589 --> 03:37.133
Well, this is what happens
when you sell your name.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.720
Fashion is a dirty business.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.182
[phone ringing]

03:44.265 --> 03:46.142
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Nicolas, hey.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.938
Emily, isn't this exciting.
We're finally in business together.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.773
You can stop harassing me.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.858
Well, be careful what you wish for.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.860
We'd like to hold on the press release

03:55.944 --> 03:58.029
announcing Gregory
as the Creative Director.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.114
At least until
Pierre is out of the hospital.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.908
You can wait on the press release,

04:01.991 --> 04:05.703
but I plan to announce Gregory's
appointment tomorrow at the store opening.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.247
All the fashion press will be there.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.999
But Pierre's completely in the dark
about all of this.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.668
He should answer my calls then.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.586
-Wouldn't it be better--
<i>-I've got to run.</i>

04:13.670 --> 04:14.671
Important meeting.

04:15.546 --> 04:16.631
[cell phone beeps]

04:21.261 --> 04:22.262
For me?

04:28.559 --> 04:29.602
I'm so lucky.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.729
I was just thinking the same thing.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.732
And this view…

04:34.816 --> 04:36.943
The company pays for my apartments.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.446
They consider it
a reflection of the brand.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.283
Which is ultimately
a reflection of my father.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.909
I know how it goes.

04:45.493 --> 04:48.579
Back home, I'm only known
as Li Chen's daughter.

04:48.663 --> 04:53.209
Actually, boarding school
was the first time I got to be Mindy.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.295
And I liked her.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.171
-I like her too.
-[Mindy chuckles]

04:57.588 --> 04:59.966
And I know
it's not as easy as you make it seem.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.844
You carrying on the family business

05:02.927 --> 05:05.471
and still trying
to make an identity for yourself.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.099
I couldn't do it.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.563
If I had your talent,
I wouldn't be doing this either.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.897
Oh.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.232
You have talent.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.484
Lots of talents.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.578
[door opens]

05:28.661 --> 05:30.496
Nicolas wants to announce
Gregory's takeover

05:30.580 --> 05:31.664
tomorrow at the opening.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.750
Well, this doesn't surprise me.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.336
JVMA always
puts their own interests first.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.338
That's it?
We have to do something.

05:38.421 --> 05:41.632
I think you already did enough.
Do you mind closing the door?

05:41.716 --> 05:43.593
-But how can--
-It's business, Emily.

05:43.676 --> 05:44.761
-Without even--
-Door.

05:44.844 --> 05:45.720
[groans]

05:53.102 --> 05:54.020

06:01.694 --> 06:03.738
[in French] <i>Bonjour.</i>
This is Sylvie Grateau.

06:04.238 --> 06:07.158
Please tell Monsieur De Leon

06:07.241 --> 06:09.911
I need to meet with him
as soon as possible.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.830
[people chattering indistinctly]

06:15.458 --> 06:16.918

[classical music playing]

06:28.638 --> 06:30.139
Sylvie Grateau.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.600
It's nice to see you
after all these years.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.560
Louis.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.480
Thank you for meeting with me.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.732
What can I do for you?

06:41.025 --> 06:42.527
I'm not sure you know,

06:42.610 --> 06:44.821
but I have my own marketing firm now.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.866
And we're partnering with your son
on Pierre Cadault.

06:48.950 --> 06:49.951
Very well.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.247
Well, you must have
something very special to offer.

06:55.623 --> 06:59.544
Our client, Gregory Dupree,
is taking over the label.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.713
And I'm trying
to help ease the transition.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.466
I heard about Pierre's accident.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.677
-How is he doing?
-Still in the hospital.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.097
And in consideration of that,
I think we delay Gregory's appointment

07:11.180 --> 07:15.518
and let Pierre leave with
the grace and dignity he deserves.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.061
It's in Nicolas's hands.

07:17.145 --> 07:20.148
I'll talk to him,
but ultimately it's his decision.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.357
Louis…

07:21.441 --> 07:22.900
This is not the way to transfer power

07:22.984 --> 07:25.069
from a celebrated designer
to his former protégé.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.446
Unless they're in agreement,

07:26.529 --> 07:28.823
you're going to have
a media war on your hands.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.701
[chuckles]

07:31.784 --> 07:33.995
I remember
when you were just an assistant.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.665
And you're just as feisty and beautiful
now as you were then.

07:38.332 --> 07:41.002
I'm happy to see you haven't changed.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.006
I remember you
when I was just an assistant, too.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.508
I remember everything.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.097
And I certainly hope you have changed.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.601
[chuckles softly]

07:57.852 --> 08:00.229
Are you really sure
there's nothing you can do?

08:01.105 --> 08:01.939
Okay, Sylvie.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.734
I'll have Nicolas delay the announcement.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.111
Given the circumstances,
it's the respectful thing to do.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.280
And…

08:11.157 --> 08:15.495
I would only like to be remembered
as a respectful man.

08:18.539 --> 08:19.373
<i>Bon.</i>

08:20.124 --> 08:21.501
Now, what will you be having for lunch?

08:22.418 --> 08:23.503
[chuckles softly]

08:28.508 --> 08:29.717
[Emily squeals]

08:29.800 --> 08:33.137
My God. You were amazing.
And you look so hot.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.806
I am hot. This outfit is plastic.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.267
It's like shoving your privates
in a Ziploc bag.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.186
Like a sandwich on a field trip.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.103
Mmm.

08:41.812 --> 08:42.855
Hi.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.692
You were absolutely brilliant tonight.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.278
Thanks, babe. And the night's not over.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.405
I'm gonna add a pickle to my sandwich.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.323
Mmm.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.033
Hi.

08:54.617 --> 08:59.622
So, Emily, your boss talked to my father
about delaying Gregory's announcement.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.542
-She did?
-Really? You didn't know?

09:02.625 --> 09:05.127
It wasn't your idea to go over my head?

09:05.211 --> 09:06.546
I'm sure it wasn't.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.714
Sylvie doesn't like Emily.
They hardly talk.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.591
That's not true. We talk all the time.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.802
Deep down, I really do think she likes me.

09:12.885 --> 09:16.305
-Or at least respects me.
-I'm trying to help you out here, sis.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.140
What I don't understand is

09:18.224 --> 09:20.893
you've been on me
to work together this whole time.

09:20.977 --> 09:24.897
And I finally say yes, in a big way,
and you're still not happy.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.318
Look, this has nothing to do with me
or with Sylvie. Okay?

09:29.986 --> 09:32.196
There's a way to break news to people.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.114
I agree.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.741
When there's a changing of the guard,
there's a ceremony.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.243
That's at the store opening.

09:37.326 --> 09:40.705
It's not your decision.
It's not my father's decision. It's mine.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.001
-Then it's settled.
-Yes. I thought it was.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.337
Okay. Great.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.089
Well, I'm starving,

09:50.172 --> 09:53.634
so maybe let's pause on the work chat
and grab some dinner?

09:53.718 --> 09:54.844
Um…

09:55.761 --> 09:58.681
Actually, I think
I'm probably just going to head home,

09:58.764 --> 10:01.726
but you guys have fun.
And I'll just see you tomorrow.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.734
It's fine. She knows when three's a crowd.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.862
-You good?
-Yeah.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.158
[pensive music playing]

[cell phone chimes]

10:44.852 --> 10:45.686
[Gabriel] Emily!

10:54.820 --> 10:56.113
-Hey.
-[Emily] Oh, wow.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.824
Okay, well, we're sitting on the ground.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.620
-Isn't this cool?
-Yeah.

11:03.788 --> 11:07.166
Other than the fact that
I'm terrified I'm going to lose my shoes,

11:08.376 --> 11:09.210
yeah.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.212
Let me.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.302
Better?

11:19.637 --> 11:20.554
Thanks.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.686
[Emily chuckles]

11:29.647 --> 11:30.940
-Mmm!
-[Gabriel laughs]

11:32.400 --> 11:33.651
That's not wine.

11:33.734 --> 11:37.154
That's whisky. Japanese.
I borrowed it from the restaurant.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.033
Why are you at the canal
drinking brown liquor?

11:41.117 --> 11:42.118
[sighs]

11:44.370 --> 11:46.747
Camille, she posted a picture

11:46.831 --> 11:49.333
partying in Greece
with Sofia and some guys.

11:50.876 --> 11:51.877
Probably hooking up.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.087
[coughs]

11:55.423 --> 11:58.050
It's the whisky, it's…
It's still really in there.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.095
Look at the picture.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.348
See how they've got
their arms around her and…

12:05.182 --> 12:06.559
I mean, who are those guys?

12:07.351 --> 12:08.519
They're hitting on her.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.855
I'm sure Camille can take care of herself.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.399
She sent me a text
saying she was coming home earlier,

12:13.482 --> 12:15.234
and I said what's going on,

12:16.235 --> 12:19.196
and she said better to talk in person.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.366
Oh, yeah, no, that's very different.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.119
She's ending things and it's my fault.

She never forgave me
for what happened between us.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.933
Okay, you two
weren't together at the time,

12:48.017 --> 12:50.519
so let's not forget
that very important detail.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.855

It's…

13:08.120 --> 13:10.831

I think we should call a cab.

You know what, Emily?

I know you can't have an open container

13:35.773 --> 13:37.942
Part of me wishes
you went back to Chicago.

13:38.025 --> 13:40.528
Part of me wishes I was there right now.

13:40.611 --> 13:41.612

13:42.112 --> 13:44.073
You changed my life.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.452
And I'm glad we had our moment.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.498
I felt a life-time,
I felt like that one night--

13:53.165 --> 13:56.752
I'm with Alfie. And you are with Camille.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.420
See that's the problem. I'm…

14:00.172 --> 14:01.423
I love you both.

14:02.007 --> 14:02.842

And you will.

He just copies everyone.

Sure, but alcohol doesn't make people lie.

Kind of the opposite.

Mmm.

No, but it's just the way

23:33.620 --> 23:34.746
Is Camille back?

23:34.830 --> 23:36.623
She came back yesterday.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.918
Okay. And?

23:40.001 --> 23:41.128
We missed each other.

23:41.920 --> 23:42.754
That's…

23:43.964 --> 23:46.508
That was the issue? There's nothing else?

23:46.591 --> 23:49.803
Nothing and no one,
which was my real fear.

23:49.886 --> 23:54.599
And now that we had a proper conversation,
our relationship feels stronger than ever.

23:54.683 --> 23:58.395
And I'm so sorry for calling you
so drunk the other night. I…

23:58.478 --> 24:00.981
probably said a few things
I can't even remember.

24:01.940 --> 24:02.941
[chuckles]

24:05.193 --> 24:07.487
I'm just glad
that you two are working things out.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.615
Thank you. So am I.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.076
-Bye.
-Bye.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.082
But you owe me 26 euros for the cab!
