<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries...

00:02.134 --> 00:03.467
- <i>I'm Sybil.
- We are talking</i>

00:03.492 --> 00:05.873
about a living, breathing siren.

00:05.875 --> 00:09.257
SYBIL: <i>Damon is completely devoted to me.</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:11.993
GEORGIE: <i>This thing, it was delivered
with your vault inhabitant.</i>

00:11.995 --> 00:13.128
<i>I think it was made in hell.</i>

00:13.130 --> 00:14.096
It's a tuning fork.

00:14.098 --> 00:15.263
(ringing)

00:15.265 --> 00:16.765
(yells)

00:16.767 --> 00:17.833
(whimpering)

00:17.835 --> 00:18.967
(grunts)

00:18.969 --> 00:19.968
Damon, it's over.

00:19.970 --> 00:21.069
You're free now.

00:21.071 --> 00:22.437
I wish that were the case, Stefan,

00:22.439 --> 00:24.573
but my work with her is
just getting started.

00:24.575 --> 00:27.027
I really hoped that
when we put Sybil down,

00:27.029 --> 00:28.971
<i>it'd break whatever
control she had over him.</i>

00:28.973 --> 00:31.646
<i>But somehow, some way,
she still has ahold of him.</i>

00:31.648 --> 00:32.981
What else is there to do?

00:32.983 --> 00:35.083
You still have too many attachments.

00:35.085 --> 00:37.252
Too many people willing to fight for you.

00:37.254 --> 00:38.437
<i>We should work on that.</i>

00:38.439 --> 00:39.233
Lockwood.

00:39.235 --> 00:40.429
Damon, wait!

00:41.091 --> 00:42.718
ALARIC: <i>Sirens use mind control</i>

00:42.720 --> 00:44.359
<i>to lure their victims to their death.</i>

00:44.361 --> 00:46.396
Some say they're messengers of the Devil.

00:46.398 --> 00:49.226
<i>I suppose every story
has to start somewhere.</i>

00:57.608 --> 00:59.241
(shivering): Tell me a story.

00:59.243 --> 01:01.410
What kind of story?

01:02.713 --> 01:05.013
Something happy.

01:05.015 --> 01:07.315
A long time ago,

01:07.317 --> 01:08.817
in a village

01:08.819 --> 01:11.153
built on this very spot,

01:11.155 --> 01:13.121
lived a man.

01:13.123 --> 01:14.823
Arcadius.

01:18.662 --> 01:22.631
<i>Cade, to his friends,
of which he had many.</i>

01:22.633 --> 01:25.184
<i>He was a gentle man,</i>

01:25.209 --> 01:28.670
<i>loved and respected.</i>

01:32.697 --> 01:36.111
<i>But Cade could do something
that no one else could:</i>

01:36.113 --> 01:39.830
<i>he could see into the minds of others.</i>

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.393 --> 01:50.692
He was psychic?

01:50.694 --> 01:53.395
The first psychic.

01:53.397 --> 01:58.066
It was this power that gave him
so much empathy towards others.

01:58.068 --> 02:02.871
And it was this power that
would cost him his life.

02:20.591 --> 02:22.891
The thing you imagine, brother...

02:24.061 --> 02:26.161
It is impure.

02:26.163 --> 02:27.496
It's forbidden.

02:27.498 --> 02:30.565
If you allow me deeper into your mind,

02:30.567 --> 02:34.069
perhaps I can help quell your urges.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.571
GIRL: <i>Cade had only wanted to help.</i>

02:36.573 --> 02:38.073
<i>But he had overstepped.</i>

02:38.075 --> 02:39.574
(men shouting)

02:39.576 --> 02:40.876
(Cade grunting)

02:40.878 --> 02:42.911
(shouting continues)

02:42.913 --> 02:46.285
<i>And the men, fearing his power,</i>

02:46.310 --> 02:49.417
<i>turned even Cade's friends against him.</i>

02:49.419 --> 02:51.286
(grunting)

02:51.288 --> 02:54.389
<i>And it was then that
Cade came to know</i>

02:54.391 --> 02:55.957
<i>the thing inside men</i>

02:55.959 --> 02:57.459
<i>that even his power</i>

02:57.461 --> 02:59.661
<i>had not been able to divine:</i>

02:59.663 --> 03:01.663
<i>true evil.</i>

03:07.271 --> 03:08.904
(screaming)

03:08.906 --> 03:12.207
I asked for a happy story.

03:12.209 --> 03:14.876
But it is, dear sister.

03:14.878 --> 03:18.547
For in death, Cade was triumphant.

03:18.549 --> 03:20.415
From that moment onward,

03:20.417 --> 03:23.451
evil men would be forever punished

03:23.453 --> 03:25.520
for their wicked deeds.

03:25.522 --> 03:27.589
Cade had his revenge.

03:27.591 --> 03:29.124
And someday,

03:29.126 --> 03:32.460
so will we.

(phone beeps)

03:56.253 --> 03:57.185
Hey.

03:57.187 --> 03:58.253
CAROLINE: Hey.

03:58.255 --> 04:00.155
For future reference,

04:00.157 --> 04:02.157
just because I spend
the night with Bonnie

04:02.159 --> 04:04.759
doesn't mean you can't
sleep in your own bed.

04:04.761 --> 04:07.128
Right, yeah, no.
I-I crashed at the Armory.

04:07.130 --> 04:09.431
I figured I'd give you two some space.

04:09.433 --> 04:10.765
How's Bonnie doing?

04:10.767 --> 04:11.967
Glued to Enzo's side,

04:11.969 --> 04:14.369
despite all the awful
things he's saying to her.

04:14.371 --> 04:16.370
It's gonna take another
day or two of starving him

04:16.373 --> 04:19.040
before she can get started
with his humanity switch.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.175
Well, if anyone can bring him back,

04:20.177 --> 04:21.176
Bonnie can.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.237
Hey, you know what,

04:23.262 --> 04:24.412
I should probably get going.

04:24.414 --> 04:25.614
Alaric and I

04:25.616 --> 04:27.749
have a little date with a siren.

04:27.751 --> 04:28.950
Be careful.

04:28.952 --> 04:30.218
You've seen what Sybil can do

04:30.220 --> 04:31.653
when she gets inside your head.

04:31.655 --> 04:34.089
As long as this tuning fork
is ringing, she can't.

04:34.091 --> 04:35.624
Is there some sort of engaged person

04:35.626 --> 04:38.660
shorthand for "Good luck and...

04:38.662 --> 04:39.928
I'm with you in spirit"?

04:39.930 --> 04:41.696
Yeah, I think it's "I love you."

04:41.698 --> 04:43.632
I love you, too.

04:44.635 --> 04:46.668
Hey, thanks.

04:46.670 --> 04:49.583
Oh, thank the nanny.
She's the unwitting enabler.

04:49.608 --> 04:51.339
GEORGIE: Oh, hey.

04:51.341 --> 04:52.674
Uh...

04:52.676 --> 04:53.937
I thought I told you
not to come in today.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.644
Well, I heard there was a coffee shortage

04:55.646 --> 04:57.078
and came running.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.146
Well, actually,

04:58.148 --> 04:59.489
we're in the middle of a major project.

04:59.513 --> 05:00.724
So why don't you take the day off...

05:00.748 --> 05:02.150
Major project? Sounds sketchy.

05:02.152 --> 05:03.852
Got a girl tied up in the basement?

05:06.034 --> 05:07.600
Jokes.

05:08.258 --> 05:10.435
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.360
(Alaric sighs)

05:12.362 --> 05:15.330
I can only deal with
one temptress at a time.

05:15.332 --> 05:17.232
Anyway, any word from Damon?

05:17.234 --> 05:20.802
None. And that's what worries me.

05:20.804 --> 05:24.305
(rock music playing)

05:32.716 --> 05:34.482
Hey!

05:34.484 --> 05:37.686
Hey! Earth to Planet Redneck.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.121
Are you Peter Maxwell?

05:40.123 --> 05:41.423
No, Pete owns the place.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.091
I'm just the hired help.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.959
Name's Lou. What can I do for you?

05:44.961 --> 05:47.362
I really need to talk to Pete.

05:47.364 --> 05:49.164
Well, have it your way.

05:49.166 --> 05:50.932
He should be back in a bit.

05:52.202 --> 05:54.952
Hey, what exactly brings you out here?

05:54.977 --> 05:56.571
You know, it's hard to say.

05:56.573 --> 05:57.806
To be honest, I'm not even the one

05:57.808 --> 05:59.708
that cares about finding your boss.

05:59.733 --> 06:02.343
There is a woman...
and I use that term loosely...

06:02.345 --> 06:04.779
Named Sybil, who wants to.

06:04.781 --> 06:08.383
So, inexplicably,

06:08.385 --> 06:09.918
here I am.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.554
Sounds like that gal's
screwing with your head.

06:12.556 --> 06:15.457
Oh, you have no idea.

06:15.459 --> 06:18.526
You'd be surprised.
I've been married five times.

06:19.396 --> 06:22.530
Oh, I take that back.

06:22.532 --> 06:24.199
You do get me, Lou.

06:24.201 --> 06:26.401
See, the catch is:

06:26.403 --> 06:27.969
Sybil and I had a thing,

06:27.971 --> 06:29.104
but it's done.

06:29.106 --> 06:30.705
In theory, I'm a free man,

06:30.707 --> 06:33.541
but I still find myself
doing whatever it is

06:33.543 --> 06:35.577
I think she'd want me to be doing.

06:35.579 --> 06:37.412
Hell, between you and me,

06:37.414 --> 06:39.180
I'd probably kill for her.

06:39.182 --> 06:41.483
♪ ♪

06:41.485 --> 06:43.651
Pete'll be back soon.
I should get back to work.

06:43.676 --> 06:45.153
No,

06:45.155 --> 06:47.589
you should do everything I say.

06:47.591 --> 06:50.894
Just answer one more question for me.

06:50.919 --> 06:52.927
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

06:52.929 --> 06:56.965
I murdered one of those
wives I told you about.

06:56.967 --> 06:58.767
Made it look like an accident.

06:58.769 --> 07:00.935
Don't move.

07:00.937 --> 07:05.073
Oh, damn. I was rooting for you, Lou.

07:06.943 --> 07:08.977
I really was.

07:17.487 --> 07:19.821
Now, like you said...

07:19.823 --> 07:21.389
get back to work.

07:31.668 --> 07:34.135
(screaming)

07:34.137 --> 07:38.306
(humming)

07:40.443 --> 07:42.310
- (clanging)
- (Sybil gasps)

07:42.312 --> 07:45.146
(ringing)

07:45.148 --> 07:46.748
The all-powerful siren.

07:46.750 --> 07:49.617
Imprisoned by a fork.

07:49.619 --> 07:52.320
Says the man who can
be killed with a stick.

07:52.322 --> 07:53.855
What is it about this thing

07:53.857 --> 07:54.889
that hurts you so much?

07:54.891 --> 07:56.372
And why does it hurt my kids?

07:56.397 --> 07:58.793
And here I thought you
had me all figured out.

07:58.795 --> 08:00.128
Guess not.

08:01.264 --> 08:03.231
(ringing)

08:04.313 --> 08:06.267
If this dis upts your psychic ability,

08:06.269 --> 08:08.336
then why is Damon still your puppet?

08:08.338 --> 08:12.841
I tinkered with the deepest
reaches of his subconscious.

08:12.843 --> 08:15.777
If Damon's still serving me,
it's because deep down,

08:15.779 --> 08:17.011
he wants to.

08:17.013 --> 08:19.581
Why are you doing this to him?

08:19.583 --> 08:21.950
It's all Damon, Damon, Damon.

08:21.952 --> 08:23.618
Aren't you even a little curious

08:23.620 --> 08:25.086
about who I am?

08:25.088 --> 08:26.955
No, actually.

08:26.957 --> 08:30.491
All I care about is how
to save my brother.

08:30.493 --> 08:31.860
Well, fortunately,

08:31.862 --> 08:34.095
the answer to your question is...

08:34.097 --> 08:36.631
a story. About me.

08:36.633 --> 08:39.299
You like stories, don't you, Professor?

08:39.302 --> 08:41.469
I prefer nonfiction.

08:41.471 --> 08:43.671
Well, then you'll love this one.

08:43.673 --> 08:45.707
A long time ago,

08:45.709 --> 08:47.909
in a little Mediterranean village,

08:47.911 --> 08:49.344
there was a girl.

08:49.346 --> 08:51.279
<i>As she came of age,</i>

08:51.281 --> 08:54.446
<i>the village girl began to
manifest psychic abilities,</i>

08:54.471 --> 08:56.517
<i>a trait that had been
forbidden in her land</i>

08:56.519 --> 08:58.653
<i>for as long as anyone could remember.</i>

08:58.655 --> 08:59.654
(crying)

08:59.656 --> 09:00.521
Help me, please!

09:00.523 --> 09:01.656
SYBIL: <i>The fate of psychics</i>

09:01.658 --> 09:03.091
was exile.

09:03.093 --> 09:04.425
Which is how our poor,

09:04.427 --> 09:06.261
innocent, forsaken village girl

09:06.263 --> 09:08.329
ended up on a raft...

09:08.331 --> 09:09.931
The current carrying her

09:09.933 --> 09:13.001
into the rocks of a cold
and distant shore.

09:18.141 --> 09:22.310
(panting)

09:24.047 --> 09:27.749
<i>But abandoned though she was meant to be,</i>

09:27.751 --> 09:29.817
<i>alone she was not.</i>

09:36.259 --> 09:38.126
<i>There she met</i>

09:38.128 --> 09:40.361
the girl of the island.

09:43.466 --> 09:45.979
<i>Exiled together,</i>

09:46.004 --> 09:47.669
<i>connected in psychic ability,</i>

09:47.671 --> 09:50.138
<i>two sisters in everything but blood,</i>

09:50.140 --> 09:53.641
destined from that moment
to one day become...

09:54.736 --> 09:56.503
...the sirens.

09:56.980 --> 09:58.546
So you see, Stefan,

09:58.548 --> 10:01.883
I understand why you would
do anything for your brother.

10:03.053 --> 10:07.922
Because my sister
will do anything for me.

10:07.924 --> 10:10.058
Will do?

10:10.060 --> 10:11.993
Present tense?

10:11.995 --> 10:15.396
(chuckling): Oh, did I forget to
mention there are two of us?

10:16.967 --> 10:19.167
Me in here.

10:19.169 --> 10:21.269
And her out there.

10:29.414 --> 10:31.222
Ugh!

10:31.247 --> 10:34.314
Would you please stop doing that?

10:34.316 --> 10:36.150
It is complete overkill.

10:36.152 --> 10:37.851
What do you mean, two sirens?

10:37.853 --> 10:39.353
I thought you were a scholar.

10:39.355 --> 10:42.823
Every single mythological
interpretation of who I am

10:42.825 --> 10:45.225
mentions sirens... plural.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.427
Well, those same myths
also say that you should

10:47.429 --> 10:49.029
have the lower half of a bird.

10:49.031 --> 10:52.065
(laughs): Well, luckily for us all,

10:52.067 --> 10:54.968
you can't believe
everything that you read.

10:54.970 --> 10:56.103
Enough.

10:56.105 --> 10:57.838
Who is she?

10:57.840 --> 10:59.373
Patience, Stefan.

10:59.375 --> 11:02.142
I promise you'll find out soon enough.

11:02.144 --> 11:03.610
(chuckles)

11:17.893 --> 11:20.527
- (pre-alarm beeping)
- Oh, crap.

11:32.708 --> 11:35.242
- (beeping continues)
- Oh, yes.

11:40.616 --> 11:43.116
SELINE: Don't move, or I call the police!

11:43.118 --> 11:45.352
(beeping stops)

11:46.655 --> 11:49.790
Oh... it's the intern.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.448
Oh... the nanny.

11:52.473 --> 11:54.027
It's Georgie, right?

11:54.029 --> 11:56.230
Do you break into houses often?

11:56.232 --> 11:59.032
I got to get into Alaric's bed somehow.

11:59.034 --> 12:02.236
Uh, okay, the boss man just asked me

12:02.238 --> 12:03.916
to bring this journal back to the Armory,

12:03.941 --> 12:06.773
and like a dumbass, I didn't
think to ask him for the keys.

12:06.775 --> 12:09.543
I just figured I'd save
myself an embarrassing call.

12:09.545 --> 12:11.078
Well, the call I'm about to make

12:11.080 --> 12:12.879
is probably even more embarrassing.

12:12.881 --> 12:14.314
Okay.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.446
Maybe you better stay put.

12:16.471 --> 12:18.852
Maybe you should stick
to naps and snacks.

12:18.854 --> 12:21.722
Okeydokey. Calling Ric.

12:21.724 --> 12:25.459
I really wouldn't do that if I were you.

12:27.396 --> 12:29.963
(tires screech)

12:38.240 --> 12:39.706
You must be Peter Maxwell.

12:39.708 --> 12:40.707
Who the hell are you?

12:40.709 --> 12:43.176
Damon Salvatore. AKA...

12:43.178 --> 12:47.180
the guy that barbecued your
little grease monkey over there.

12:47.182 --> 12:48.711
No offense, Pete, but I don't think

12:48.736 --> 12:50.284
that extinguisher's gonna work.

12:50.286 --> 12:52.686
Lou's got a date for an eternal burn.

12:55.712 --> 12:57.858
Uh, before you make that
phone call, I want you

12:57.860 --> 12:59.860
to ask yourself one question.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.695
If I just murdered your
faithful manservant

13:01.697 --> 13:03.196
in cold blood, why would I have

13:03.198 --> 13:05.332
any problem murdering you?

13:07.603 --> 13:10.203
Good boy.

13:10.205 --> 13:11.872
But that was a trick question, Pete.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.875
I can't actually kill you... yet.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.576
Well, that's comforting, I guess.

13:16.578 --> 13:17.744
You ever meet a girl named Sybil?

13:17.746 --> 13:19.846
About yay high, hot as hell.

13:19.848 --> 13:22.649
Face rots off when she
doesn't feed on human flesh?

13:22.651 --> 13:23.717
You're insane.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.185
I'm gonna take that as a no, Pete.

13:25.187 --> 13:27.821
Then again, you could be lying to me.

13:28.562 --> 13:30.057
(grunts)

13:30.059 --> 13:31.958
Now tell me the truth. Do you have any idea

13:31.960 --> 13:33.527
- what I'm talking about?
- No.

13:33.529 --> 13:35.829
Everything you're saying sounds crazy.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.868
Damn it.

13:41.870 --> 13:43.637
I'm gonna make this as simple as I can.

13:43.639 --> 13:45.706
You have something Sybil wants,

13:45.708 --> 13:47.040
I'm gonna deliver it.

13:47.042 --> 13:49.543
You can take whatever it is and just go.

13:49.545 --> 13:51.278
That's not an option, Pete.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.280
I don't exactly know what I'm looking for.

13:53.282 --> 13:54.948
Then how are you supposed to find it?

13:54.950 --> 13:57.818
We, Pete. <i>We.</i>

13:57.820 --> 13:58.902
Here's the deal.

13:58.927 --> 14:00.654
All I consciously know is that it's

14:00.656 --> 14:02.322
a Maxwell family heirloom.

14:02.324 --> 14:04.524
But subconsciously, I'm pretty damn sure

14:04.526 --> 14:06.293
I'll know it when I see it.

14:06.295 --> 14:09.162
Okay? So where should we start looking?

14:09.164 --> 14:10.797
I-I have no idea.

14:10.799 --> 14:13.333
Look, the only family I have is my son.

14:13.335 --> 14:15.569
I need you to think real hard,

14:15.571 --> 14:16.903
'cause your life depends on it.

14:16.905 --> 14:17.904
A couple years ago,

14:17.906 --> 14:19.506
my grandmother died, all right?

14:19.508 --> 14:21.208
She left me a box of stuff.

14:21.210 --> 14:22.476
Sounds promising.

14:22.478 --> 14:23.677
What kind of stuff we talking about?

14:23.679 --> 14:25.345
I don't know. I never opened it.

14:25.347 --> 14:27.260
Family's a bit of a sore spot with me.

14:27.285 --> 14:29.683
Trust me, I know the feeling, man.

14:29.685 --> 14:31.218
Where's this box, Pete?

14:31.220 --> 14:32.686
It's somewhere in the storage room.

14:32.688 --> 14:34.154
My son was looking for it a while back.

14:34.156 --> 14:36.523
- Maybe he found it, all right?
- Oh, good.

14:36.525 --> 14:38.325
Call Junior. Get him over here.

14:38.327 --> 14:39.826
Now.

14:41.497 --> 14:43.864
(cell phone ringing)

14:43.866 --> 14:46.900
It's Seline. You got this?

14:46.902 --> 14:48.268
Yeah.

14:48.270 --> 14:51.538
Seline? Suspicious name.

14:51.540 --> 14:53.006
Very siren-y.

14:53.008 --> 14:55.175
How about we just focus
on you and your sister?

14:55.177 --> 14:58.712
I think I'll just wait
for Alaric to get back.

14:58.714 --> 15:01.214
- (tuning fork reverberating)
- You're stalling.

15:01.216 --> 15:02.682
Who is she?

15:02.684 --> 15:06.086
You think hurting me
is gonna speed this up?

15:06.088 --> 15:07.454
(sound sustaining)

15:11.393 --> 15:12.392
(sound stops)

15:12.394 --> 15:13.460
(exhales)

15:13.462 --> 15:15.429
Thank you.

15:15.431 --> 15:18.598
<i>Now, despite enjoying
each other's company,</i>

15:18.600 --> 15:21.701
<i>the girls had another
constant companion...</i>

15:21.703 --> 15:22.903
<i>hunger.</i>

15:22.905 --> 15:24.771
<i>The one who had survived</i>

15:24.773 --> 15:28.408
<i>on the island this long had a plan.</i>

15:28.410 --> 15:30.644
Call out to them with me.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.281
They will never hear us.

15:34.283 --> 15:36.216
Raise your voice,

15:36.218 --> 15:38.452
and your mind will soar out to meet it.

15:45.427 --> 15:46.827
(voices echoing) Help!

15:46.829 --> 15:48.428
Over here!

15:48.430 --> 15:49.596
Help!

15:49.598 --> 15:51.665
Help! Help!

15:51.667 --> 15:53.700
Please. Over here.

15:53.702 --> 15:54.835
Help! Here!

15:54.837 --> 15:56.937
They heard us.

15:56.939 --> 15:58.982
The ship is coming our way.

15:59.007 --> 16:00.640
We are saved.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.294
Over here.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.515
SYBIL: <i>But the girl of the island</i>

16:08.540 --> 16:09.749
knew better.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.618
She had done this before,

16:11.620 --> 16:14.221
called out to passing
sailors with her mind.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.424
But no matter how keen her psychic reach,

16:17.426 --> 16:20.327
the shoals around the
island were sharper.

16:20.329 --> 16:22.162
So you beached the ship.

16:22.164 --> 16:23.797
Try <i>annihilated.</i>

16:23.799 --> 16:27.367
Dashed upon the rocks,
dooming its sailors to death.

16:27.369 --> 16:29.876
But, silver lining,

16:29.901 --> 16:31.771
their sweet, sweet provisions

16:31.773 --> 16:34.341
would soon wash up on shore.

16:44.419 --> 16:47.187
The tides were not in our favor today.

16:47.189 --> 16:49.222
This is all that washed up.

16:49.224 --> 16:51.658
You knew this would happen?

16:51.660 --> 16:53.260
The island is barren,

16:53.262 --> 16:56.563
save for berries and wild boar.

16:56.565 --> 16:58.164
This way is easier...

16:58.166 --> 17:01.668
and more fun.

17:02.771 --> 17:05.906
Sister, do not weep for them.

17:05.907 --> 17:08.875
Those sailors were from <i>our</i> village.

17:08.877 --> 17:12.078
The same men who banished us here to die.

17:12.079 --> 17:14.848
Never again.

17:14.849 --> 17:18.718
If we cannot live off of
what God has provided for us,

17:18.720 --> 17:20.854
then we are not meant to live at all.

17:22.357 --> 17:24.357
Promise me?

17:27.563 --> 17:30.630
Stop me if this sounds familiar.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.833
One good sibling,
determined to live like a monk,

17:33.835 --> 17:36.236
and one selfishly evil sibling,

17:36.238 --> 17:38.872
willing to murder to
satiate their hunger.

17:40.719 --> 17:42.842
Oh, come on, you get it.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.945
The parallels are too good.

17:44.947 --> 17:48.181
Our story is your story, Stefan.

17:48.183 --> 17:50.550
So now here's the test.

17:50.552 --> 17:53.053
Which girl are you?

17:54.723 --> 17:56.790
(machine bells clanging)

18:02.232 --> 18:04.898
So, uh, what do you think?

18:04.900 --> 18:07.467
I think it's a hood ornament, Pete.

18:07.469 --> 18:10.437
Vintage Rolls-Royce.

18:10.439 --> 18:12.505
Aah! I also think

18:12.507 --> 18:14.474
that you're in danger
of losing a real life.

18:14.476 --> 18:16.476
I'm doing what you asked.

18:16.478 --> 18:18.111
Oh, are you? I compelled you

18:18.113 --> 18:19.346
to find what I needed.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.481
You keep bringing me a bunch of junk.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.719
Where'd you get that watch?

18:25.721 --> 18:28.662
My son gave it to me.
What difference does it make?

18:28.687 --> 18:30.601
Considering that it's a family heirloom,

18:30.626 --> 18:33.226
quite a bit... Hand it over.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.134
- (flesh sizzling)
- Aah!

18:43.438 --> 18:44.938
You're on vervain.

18:44.940 --> 18:47.007
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:47.009 --> 18:49.709
You lied to me, Pete.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.911
And you know what happens to liars.

18:56.351 --> 18:58.118
They go straight to hell.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.453
(gunshot, groaning)

19:04.389 --> 19:06.122
Donovan?

19:08.330 --> 19:09.529
(coughing)

19:09.531 --> 19:10.930
Dad.

19:14.913 --> 19:17.043
Don't move, don't move. Let me see it.

19:17.045 --> 19:20.780
(Pete straining, groaning)

19:20.782 --> 19:22.714
All right, look, it's not that bad, okay?

19:22.739 --> 19:24.450
Just keep some pressure on it,
you're gonna be fine.

19:24.452 --> 19:25.751
Don't lie to me, Matt.

19:25.753 --> 19:27.512
Look, you're gonna be fine

19:27.537 --> 19:29.055
if you do exactly as I say.

19:32.060 --> 19:34.327
- What are you doing?
- I need you to drink his blood.

19:34.329 --> 19:36.162
Why? I'll explain later,

19:36.164 --> 19:38.597
but right now I need
you to trust me, okay?

19:38.599 --> 19:40.550
- Drink.
- N-No...

19:44.878 --> 19:47.340
Wha-What?

19:55.283 --> 19:57.524
- What just happened?
- I told you I'll explain everything.

19:57.548 --> 19:59.797
But first I need to understand why
Damon was trying to hurt you.

19:59.821 --> 20:02.121
Wait, you're telling me you,
you knew this guy?

20:02.123 --> 20:03.656
I'm telling you that I <i>know</i> him.

20:03.658 --> 20:06.692
He's not dead. Not exactly.

20:06.694 --> 20:09.428
I know. None of this makes
any sense, and I know.

20:09.430 --> 20:10.696
I tracked you down a few months ago

20:10.698 --> 20:12.009
and I didn't tell you about any of this.

20:12.033 --> 20:13.566
Okay, I'm sorry, but I promise,

20:13.568 --> 20:15.534
if you go to the truck right now,
I'll explain everything.

20:15.536 --> 20:18.170
I just don't want you to
see what happens next.

20:27.515 --> 20:31.317
Look, I... I feel silly calling.
It's probably nothing.

20:31.319 --> 20:32.488
Why, what's going on?

20:32.513 --> 20:36.022
Well, your intern Georgie,
she broke into the house.

20:36.024 --> 20:36.989
Wait, she what?

20:36.991 --> 20:38.391
And she took a book.

20:38.393 --> 20:39.625
Some dead guy's journal.

20:39.627 --> 20:41.327
Said that she was
bringing it back to you?

20:41.329 --> 20:43.062
Well, are you okay? Are the girls?

20:43.064 --> 20:44.196
Yeah. Why?

20:44.198 --> 20:45.564
Should I be more worried?

20:45.566 --> 20:47.500
I mean, she's just a
little weirdo, right?

20:49.983 --> 20:52.727
It's, uh, it's fine.
Hey, thanks for calling.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.924
I-I gotta call you back, okay?

21:00.748 --> 21:05.484
Hello?

21:05.486 --> 21:06.786
(panting)

21:06.788 --> 21:08.687
Georgie?

21:08.689 --> 21:11.357
I'm here. Sorry.

21:11.359 --> 21:13.492
Wait!

21:13.494 --> 21:15.394
Look, we don't have to be enemies.

21:15.396 --> 21:17.463
Damon and I had nothing
to do with the Armory

21:17.465 --> 21:19.131
until you possessed him.

21:19.133 --> 21:20.524
If we're enemies, it's because

21:20.549 --> 21:22.468
you chose this path.

21:22.470 --> 21:24.804
- I didn't ask for any of this.
- (softly): God.

21:24.806 --> 21:26.477
You sound just like her.

21:26.502 --> 21:29.175
A victim to the last.

21:29.177 --> 21:33.245
<i>She insisted the island
would nourish them.</i>

21:33.247 --> 21:35.622
<i>And when it didn't, her faith was shaken.</i>

21:35.647 --> 21:38.417
<i>God did not provide.</i>

21:38.419 --> 21:40.586
<i>That was up to her sister.</i>

21:40.588 --> 21:43.756
<i>The other side of the island
was the wild boars' domain.</i>

21:43.758 --> 21:46.559
<i>It was dangerous,
but she knew she must hunt.</i>

21:46.561 --> 21:48.327
<i>And behold.</i>

21:48.329 --> 21:50.963
<i>God was good.</i>

21:50.965 --> 21:53.132
STEFAN: <i>Or maybe there were
no boars on the island.</i>

21:53.134 --> 21:55.401
You kept luring ships into the rocks.

21:55.403 --> 21:57.269
Killing for provisions.

21:57.271 --> 21:59.978
And do you want to know
the sickest part of all?

22:01.209 --> 22:03.909
There were no provisions on the ships.

22:03.911 --> 22:05.644
Only sailors.

22:05.646 --> 22:10.547
<i>And so, an innocent
girl became a monster.</i>

22:10.572 --> 22:11.294
<i>All because</i>

22:11.319 --> 22:14.353
<i>her older sibling forced
her to adopt her lifestyle,</i>

22:14.355 --> 22:17.256
<i>even if it meant
killing and eating men</i>

22:17.258 --> 22:18.757
to stay alive.

22:18.759 --> 22:20.426
So, I ask you again.

22:20.428 --> 22:23.329
Which girl are you?

22:23.331 --> 22:26.599
Here's all you need to know.

22:26.601 --> 22:30.302
Whatever Damon and I have done
to one another in the past,

22:30.304 --> 22:31.971
it has been forgiven.

22:31.973 --> 22:34.140
He is my brother,

22:34.142 --> 22:39.145
and there's nothing you can
do that will ever change that.

22:39.147 --> 22:40.646
(soft chuckle)

22:40.648 --> 22:43.657
I think you've overestimated your sibling.

22:44.712 --> 22:47.820
And clearly, I have underestimated mine.

22:47.822 --> 22:50.523
(groans)

23:12.170 --> 23:15.530
Hey, sailor.

23:15.532 --> 23:17.565
What did you do to me?

23:17.567 --> 23:18.389
I'm in your head.

23:18.414 --> 23:20.350
Well, our head, kind of.

23:20.375 --> 23:22.053
My memories, your noggin.

23:22.078 --> 23:24.872
Your silly fork stopped ringing.

23:25.850 --> 23:27.301
There's nowhere to run.

23:27.303 --> 23:29.870
So walk with me.

23:31.407 --> 23:33.841
Oh, so is this where you attack my psyche?

23:33.843 --> 23:35.441
Try to break me down?

23:35.466 --> 23:36.715
Normally, yes.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.645
But the boss has other plans for you.

23:38.647 --> 23:40.447
- The boss?
- Mm-hmm.

23:40.449 --> 23:42.049
What are you talking about?

23:42.051 --> 23:44.618
He thinks you're worthy of
hearing the whole story.

23:45.822 --> 23:47.589
Shall we continue?

23:54.864 --> 23:57.831
For years, my sister
and I lived as cannibals.

23:57.833 --> 23:59.900
One willingly,

23:59.902 --> 24:02.035
one blissfully ignorant.

24:02.037 --> 24:04.738
Until I discovered this.

24:04.740 --> 24:09.076
Where my sister had buried
the sailors she had murdered.

24:09.078 --> 24:11.407
Only visible at low tide.

24:11.432 --> 24:13.547
It was the perfect hiding spot.

24:13.549 --> 24:15.115
You discovered?

24:16.940 --> 24:19.720
You're not the girl from
the island, are you?

24:19.722 --> 24:21.388
You're the village girl.

24:21.390 --> 24:25.259
(softly): I tried.

24:25.261 --> 24:28.228
(voice breaking):
I tried so hard to be good.

24:28.230 --> 24:32.293
My sister forced this existence on me.

24:32.318 --> 24:34.468
What, you expect me
to have sympathy for you?

24:34.470 --> 24:35.702
After everything you've done?

24:35.704 --> 24:38.105
Maybe, maybe not.

24:38.107 --> 24:40.908
It all comes down to the same question:

24:40.910 --> 24:46.547
which siren is your
spirit animal, Stefan?

24:47.550 --> 24:52.753
(groaning softly, chains rattling)

24:55.391 --> 24:57.424
Oh, come on, man, drop the act.

24:57.426 --> 24:59.644
We both know you're not gonna kill me.

24:59.669 --> 25:00.561
Why not?

25:00.563 --> 25:02.223
That seems to be your
solution for everything.

25:02.247 --> 25:03.469
Maybe I should give it a shot.

25:03.494 --> 25:06.300
I'm sorry, Matt, I know
this is supposed to scare me,

25:06.302 --> 25:07.801
but fear is an emotion,

25:07.803 --> 25:09.536
and ever since I flipped my switch,

25:09.538 --> 25:11.371
I'm kind of operating without them.

25:11.373 --> 25:13.240
All I'm getting from you

25:13.242 --> 25:15.275
is desperation.

25:15.277 --> 25:17.377
You're right, Damon, I am desperate.

25:17.379 --> 25:19.146
- (slicing, Damon groans)
- And for once,

25:19.148 --> 25:20.847
I don't care about your drama.

25:20.849 --> 25:23.257
I don't give a damn if you
shut your humanity off.

25:23.282 --> 25:25.719
All I want to know is why
you tried to kill my father.

25:25.721 --> 25:27.154
Look, man, in my defense,

25:27.156 --> 25:28.922
I didn't know he was your dad.

25:28.924 --> 25:30.824
I always thought you were a bastard.

25:30.826 --> 25:32.926
Shut up, I'm done playing games.

25:32.928 --> 25:34.494
(grunting)

25:34.496 --> 25:38.198
Well, Tyler Lockwood is gonna
be very sad to hear that.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.700
Because if you don't play along,

25:39.702 --> 25:41.463
he dies.

25:41.488 --> 25:43.547
Maybe you care about that?

25:43.572 --> 25:45.639
(slice, Damon groans)

25:45.641 --> 25:47.207
Not even you're that stupid.

25:47.209 --> 25:48.709
Humanity or not,

25:48.711 --> 25:50.077
nobody'd forgive you for that.

25:50.079 --> 25:51.445
Especially Elena.

25:51.447 --> 25:53.413
Well, that's the whole point, you idiot.

25:53.415 --> 25:55.782
Apparently, you've been out
of the loop for a while, Matt,

25:55.807 --> 25:58.985
so allow me to bring you up to speed.

25:59.010 --> 26:01.955
Elena and I are through.

26:01.957 --> 26:03.557
In fact,

26:03.559 --> 26:05.826
I've been seeing another woman.

26:05.828 --> 26:08.862
You're lying. Last time
I knew, Tyler was up in, uh...

26:08.864 --> 26:10.597
In New York?

26:10.599 --> 26:12.666
Am I lying or being completely truthful

26:12.668 --> 26:15.966
when I tell you that I ripped
into Tyler's throat last night?

26:15.991 --> 26:18.772
And then I took him on a road trip.

26:18.774 --> 26:21.508
Left him bleeding in the
back of a green Mustang

26:21.510 --> 26:23.836
at the Park 'N Go off I-20,

26:23.861 --> 26:26.221
right across the border.

26:26.246 --> 26:30.117
Now, is that too specific for a lie?

26:30.119 --> 26:32.819
It's your move, Matt.

26:32.821 --> 26:34.988
Ticktock.

26:34.990 --> 26:36.523
(grunts)

26:36.525 --> 26:37.824
If you hurt Tyler,

26:37.826 --> 26:40.894
I swear to God, I will kill you.

26:40.896 --> 26:45.365
Well, you can swear to God all you want.

26:45.367 --> 26:48.168
He's not the one listening.

26:55.410 --> 26:57.721
(grunts)

26:57.746 --> 26:59.913
(panting)

27:02.217 --> 27:03.850
(phone clicks, then beeps)

27:03.852 --> 27:08.588
Hey, uh... Stefan.

27:08.590 --> 27:10.290
Or Caroline.

27:10.292 --> 27:12.392
I guess this is my modern-day version

27:12.394 --> 27:13.694
of a dead man's journal.

27:13.696 --> 27:16.763
P.S. I believe Georgie
is the second siren,

27:16.765 --> 27:18.365
in case you haven't figured it out.

27:18.367 --> 27:22.803
Ironically, Georgie is how
I know the way out of here

27:22.805 --> 27:25.505
is through a tunnel system
behind one of these walls.

27:25.507 --> 27:27.074
Anyway, to find that
wall and pass through it,

27:27.076 --> 27:29.763
I have to deprive myself
of sight and sound.

27:29.788 --> 27:32.045
Now, while blindfolding myself is easy...

27:32.047 --> 27:34.314
the hearing part,

27:34.316 --> 27:35.804
it's gonna be tough.

27:35.829 --> 27:37.351
(grunts)

27:37.353 --> 27:39.720
(exhales)

27:39.722 --> 27:42.155
Anyway,

27:42.157 --> 27:45.392
nothing a little vampire blood
can't fix on the "B" side.

27:45.394 --> 27:47.594
At least that's what I keep
telling myself, so,

27:47.596 --> 27:50.230
on that reassuring note...

27:50.232 --> 27:51.465
over and out.

27:51.467 --> 27:53.633
(phone beeps)

27:58.073 --> 28:00.974
(exhaling, slicing sound)

28:00.976 --> 28:03.311
(Alaric screams)

28:03.345 --> 28:05.278
I couldn't believe it.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.047
All those years,

28:07.049 --> 28:10.650
my sister tricked me
into eating human flesh.

28:10.652 --> 28:13.253
But I had to hear the
truth from her mouth,

28:13.255 --> 28:15.255
so I confronted her.

28:15.257 --> 28:18.492
You should've seen the look on her face.

28:19.549 --> 28:21.461
Oh, wait, you will.

28:21.463 --> 28:23.663
Here she comes now.

28:30.472 --> 28:31.671
No.

28:31.673 --> 28:34.274
SYBIL: Stefan, you've met my sister.

28:34.276 --> 28:36.176
Seline.

28:39.348 --> 28:41.848
Get it tucked in for you.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.216
- (phone rings)
- Oh!

28:43.218 --> 28:46.887
One second, chickadees.

28:46.889 --> 28:49.256
- Hello?
- Alaric is trapped.

28:49.258 --> 28:51.224
Why did you make me do that?

28:51.226 --> 28:53.026
Just pull over wherever you are

28:53.028 --> 28:55.162
and stay there, I will find you.

28:55.164 --> 28:57.197
We'll talk about it then.

28:57.199 --> 29:00.200
- (phone beeps)
- ELIZABETH: Will you tell us a story?

29:00.202 --> 29:01.935
Sure, sweetie. What kind of story?

29:01.937 --> 29:03.336
Nothing sad.

29:03.338 --> 29:05.505
Hmm.

29:05.507 --> 29:07.874
Okay.

29:07.876 --> 29:10.253
I know just the one,

29:10.278 --> 29:12.879
but we'll have to keep it between us.

29:12.881 --> 29:15.582
(whispering): No telling Mommy or Daddy.

29:15.584 --> 29:17.851
It is called

29:17.853 --> 29:21.221
"The Legend of Arcadius."

29:24.705 --> 29:27.027
(grunting)

29:30.449 --> 29:32.583
Hello?

29:32.585 --> 29:35.853
Little help in here.

29:40.826 --> 29:44.428
Guess it's time for plan B.

29:56.509 --> 29:57.775
The bad news...

30:00.279 --> 30:02.446
Plan B always sucks.

30:05.151 --> 30:06.950
(groaning softly)

30:06.952 --> 30:10.387
(bones cracking)

30:17.396 --> 30:19.463
Hello, beautiful.

30:19.465 --> 30:23.400
I've been looking all over for you.

30:30.442 --> 30:32.142
Don't ask me how I know this,

30:32.144 --> 30:35.045
or what the hell you're supposed to do,

30:35.047 --> 30:39.316
but Sybil's gonna be
very happy to see you.

30:39.318 --> 30:43.139
Seline is the other siren?

30:43.164 --> 30:47.252
What's more shocking? That she
secretly fed me human flesh?

30:47.277 --> 30:50.612
Or that she's now masquerading
as a friggin' nanny?

30:50.614 --> 30:52.441
Get out of my head. Now.

30:52.466 --> 30:54.716
Why, so you can go warn Alaric?

30:54.718 --> 30:56.985
You're assuming that I'm
gonna let you remember this

30:56.987 --> 30:58.253
when you wake up.

30:58.255 --> 31:00.155
Sorry.

31:00.157 --> 31:01.590
Orders from above.

31:01.592 --> 31:03.592
Well, below.

31:03.594 --> 31:05.460
(grunts)

31:15.472 --> 31:17.739
What did you do to me?

31:17.741 --> 31:18.974
You tell me.

31:18.976 --> 31:20.675
What do you remember?

31:23.981 --> 31:27.315
You confronted your sister.

31:27.317 --> 31:31.386
She turned you into a
cannibal against your wishes.

31:31.388 --> 31:34.889
And who exactly is my sister?

31:39.930 --> 31:42.097
I don't know.

31:42.966 --> 31:45.266
How frustrating.

31:45.268 --> 31:48.536
Why are you still here?

31:48.538 --> 31:50.338
I was out cold, you were in my head.

31:50.340 --> 31:52.407
Why didn't you escape?

31:52.409 --> 31:54.542
And leave you with such
a dramatic cliffhanger?

31:54.544 --> 31:56.845
(chuckles) I'm not that evil.

31:57.848 --> 32:00.148
I was about to answer your question.

32:01.284 --> 32:03.184
How you can save your brother.

32:03.186 --> 32:06.221
But for the last time, I need to know:

32:06.223 --> 32:10.025
are you an island girl or a village girl?

32:11.428 --> 32:12.694
Wait!

32:12.696 --> 32:15.096
Answer me, Stefan. This is important.

32:15.098 --> 32:17.298
Who are you in this story?

32:17.300 --> 32:21.803
The victim, who tried for years
not to feed on human blood,

32:21.805 --> 32:25.440
only for his selfish brother to
blow into town and ruin it all?

32:25.442 --> 32:27.142
Or are you the monster,

32:27.144 --> 32:29.711
who sealed his brother's
fate the day you forced him

32:29.713 --> 32:31.780
to turn into a vampire?

32:31.782 --> 32:33.815
Who doomed his brother
to an eternity of misery

32:33.817 --> 32:36.317
because you were afraid of being alone?

32:36.319 --> 32:38.119
There you go again.

32:38.121 --> 32:39.988
Old history.

32:39.990 --> 32:43.391
You'd be surprised how
fresh it is in Damon's mind.

32:43.393 --> 32:45.226
Answer me.

32:45.228 --> 32:47.395
Who are you?

32:54.705 --> 32:56.871
I'm both.

33:02.079 --> 33:05.914
I was wrong about you, Stefan.

33:05.916 --> 33:08.883
You <i>are</i> worthy.

33:08.885 --> 33:11.553
You're ready for the truth.

33:11.555 --> 33:14.748
<i>When I learned the truth
about what my sister had done</i>

33:14.773 --> 33:16.191
<i>for me,</i> (gasping)

33:16.193 --> 33:19.928
<i>I did the only thing a
decent person could do.</i>

33:19.930 --> 33:21.896
<i>I threw myself off the cliffs.</i>

33:21.898 --> 33:24.343
<i>As I lay dying,</i>

33:24.368 --> 33:26.327
<i>I prayed. For mercy.</i>

33:26.352 --> 33:28.357
<i>For love. For forgiveness.</i>

33:28.382 --> 33:30.482
(quietly): Oh... help... somebody help...

33:30.507 --> 33:33.196
SYBIL: <i>But God never answered me.</i>

33:34.188 --> 33:36.611
<i>Instead,</i> he <i>did.</i>

33:36.613 --> 33:39.814
My beautiful, broken children.

33:42.219 --> 33:43.785
Who are you?

33:43.787 --> 33:45.587
You know.

33:45.589 --> 33:47.122
Arcadius?

33:47.124 --> 33:49.989
Everyone calls me Cade.

33:50.014 --> 33:52.460
You are supposed to be dead.

33:52.462 --> 33:53.895
Rest assured.

33:53.897 --> 33:55.864
I am.

33:58.635 --> 33:59.901
My sister.

33:59.903 --> 34:01.469
Can you help her?

34:01.471 --> 34:02.904
(whispers): Yes.

34:02.906 --> 34:04.472
But...

34:04.474 --> 34:07.175
there is a price.

34:07.177 --> 34:08.909
Anything.

34:08.911 --> 34:10.645
(sniffles)

34:10.647 --> 34:12.647
My sister...

34:12.649 --> 34:15.817
She made a deal with Cade.

34:15.819 --> 34:17.585
Immortality,

34:17.587 --> 34:20.455
beauty and youth, for the two of us...

34:20.456 --> 34:24.692
if only we served our
new Lord and master.

34:24.694 --> 34:28.196
We feast on the flesh
to keep us beautiful,

34:28.197 --> 34:31.166
and he collects the souls of the wicked.

34:31.168 --> 34:33.067
In hell.

34:33.069 --> 34:35.069
Hell?

34:36.606 --> 34:38.806
As in, literal hell.
