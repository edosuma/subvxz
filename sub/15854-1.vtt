00:45.026 --> 00:49.447
(woman on TV) We all love
the richness of a good eye cream.

00:49.530 --> 00:54.994
But it does leave a richness
or a greasiness under the eye.

00:55.036 --> 00:57.872
(man) Now let's take a look
at that nasty salsa stain.

00:57.956 --> 01:01.084
This shirt is ruined. Right?
Wrong.

01:01.167 --> 01:03.252
Watch the stain-fighting power of...

01:03.670 --> 01:05.880
(woman)... designed with women in mind.

01:05.964 --> 01:08.299
If you can twist it.
Turn it. Remove it.

01:08.383 --> 01:11.302
Then you can fix it.
Replace it. Or improve it.

01:11.386 --> 01:13.388
My kits includes a guidebook...

01:13.972 --> 01:17.851
Plus they painted some people up
like animals. And now it's over.

01:19.770 --> 01:22.689
(man) If you think you need
to go to a gym to lose weight.

01:22.731 --> 01:26.735
Stay in shape. And have a body like this.
Think again.

01:26.819 --> 01:29.988
This is Bowflex. The real workout...

01:30.448 --> 01:35.369
When you're looking for a home. Your
real estate agent is a big part of your life.

01:35.411 --> 01:38.122
You need someone
you can count on.

01:38.206 --> 01:41.751
(woman) Well. They studied science
and medicine in skin care.

01:41.835 --> 01:45.088
And combined those two
in your skin solutions line.

01:45.130 --> 01:48.216
That's exactly it. I so much
appreciate being able to be here.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.594
(woman #2) Nice to have you with us.
As always.

01:50.636 --> 01:54.681
We would love to take your phone calls.
This really is a very...

01:56.308 --> 01:59.769
(man) When you contact a REMAX agent
to help you buy yourself a home.

01:59.854 --> 02:03.315
You expect service that's
a little out of the ordinary.

02:03.399 --> 02:07.444
After all. REMAX agents average
more experience and more sales

02:07.528 --> 02:09.780
than other agents.

02:10.782 --> 02:15.536
So the next time you need outstanding
real estate service. Call REMAX.

02:43.774 --> 02:45.567
(man) Can't sleep?

02:45.985 --> 02:48.779
Jesus.

02:48.821 --> 02:51.448
Oh, you scared me.

02:51.532 --> 02:54.118
I'm sorry.

02:54.160 --> 02:58.914
- What are you doing here?
- I just thought I'd check up on you.

02:58.999 --> 03:01.459
Why aren't you in bed?

03:01.543 --> 03:04.629
Your student's still here.
He's up in your study.

03:05.589 --> 03:10.343
He's not my student anymore.
He's teaching now. He's a bright kid.

03:10.844 --> 03:13.680
- What time is it?
- After midnight.

03:13.722 --> 03:16.099
- So?
- So?

03:19.478 --> 03:22.397
- Happy birthday.
- Dad!

03:25.359 --> 03:27.819
Do I ever forget?

03:27.862 --> 03:29.238
Thank you.

03:29.322 --> 03:31.949
27. I can't believe it.

03:32.033 --> 03:33.868
Neither can I.

03:35.078 --> 03:37.163
I forgot the glasses.
You want me to...?

03:37.247 --> 03:38.915
No.

03:44.880 --> 03:48.383
This is the worst champagne
I have ever tasted.

03:49.718 --> 03:53.054
- It's not even champagne.
- The bottle's the right shape.

03:53.097 --> 03:55.849
"Windy Valley Vineyards."

03:55.891 --> 04:00.353
I didn't know they made wine in Wisconsin.
You want some?

04:00.396 --> 04:03.691
I hope you're not spending
your birthday alone.

04:04.734 --> 04:06.819
- I'm not alone.
- I don't count.

04:06.903 --> 04:09.572
- Why not?
- I'm your old man. Go out with friends.

04:09.656 --> 04:12.784
- Yeah, right.
- Aren't your friends taking you out?

04:12.867 --> 04:14.201
- Nope.
- Why not?

04:14.244 --> 04:20.208
For your friends to take you out, you have
to have friends. Funny how that works.

04:20.291 --> 04:24.671
You have friends. What about that
cute blonde? Lives over on Ellis Avenue.

04:24.755 --> 04:27.966
- You used to spend every minute together.
- Christie Jacobson?

04:28.050 --> 04:29.885
Christie Jacobson.

04:29.927 --> 04:32.429
- That was in third grade, Dad.
- Oh.

04:32.471 --> 04:35.098
Last time I saw her was in a sandbox.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.185
What about Claire?

04:38.269 --> 04:41.730
She's not my friend.
She's my sister.

04:41.814 --> 04:45.150
And she's in New York.
And I don't like her.

04:45.234 --> 04:47.444
I thought she was coming in.

04:47.528 --> 04:50.364
Not till tomorrow.

04:52.659 --> 04:55.995
My advice if you can't sleep
is to sit down and do some mathematics.

04:56.079 --> 04:58.581
- Please!
- We could do some together, the old way.

04:58.665 --> 05:00.458
Can't think of anything worse.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.544
- Line by line, out loud.
- Sure you don't want any?

05:03.629 --> 05:07.716
You better get cracking. By the time I was
your age, I had already done my best work.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.678
- How old were you?
- Hmm?

05:10.761 --> 05:12.804
When it started.

05:12.888 --> 05:15.056
What?

05:15.141 --> 05:17.977
You know, when... you got sick.

05:18.060 --> 05:19.811
Uh...

05:19.854 --> 05:23.649
- 26, 27. Is that what you're worried about?
- I've thought about it.

05:23.733 --> 05:29.113
Just because I went bughouse doesn't
mean you will. It's not strictly hereditary.

05:29.155 --> 05:33.993
Listen to me. Life changes fast in your 20s,
and it shakes you up.

05:34.035 --> 05:38.080
You're down, you've had a lousy couple of
years. No one knows that better than me.

05:38.165 --> 05:40.208
- You're gonna be OK.
- I am?

05:40.292 --> 05:42.294
Yes. I promise you.

05:42.336 --> 05:46.173
The simple fact that we can
talk about this together is a good sign.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.550
- A good sign?
- Yeah.

05:48.634 --> 05:50.260
How could it be a good sign?

05:50.344 --> 05:55.724
Because crazy people don't sit around
wondering if they're nuts.

05:55.808 --> 05:58.477
- They don't?
- No. They've got better things to do.

05:58.561 --> 06:00.145
Take it from me.

06:00.188 --> 06:05.652
A very good sign that you're crazy is an
inability to ask the question, "Am I crazy?"

06:06.986 --> 06:08.988
Even if the answer is yes?

06:09.072 --> 06:11.157
Crazy people don't ask, you see?

06:12.409 --> 06:13.493
Huh.

06:13.535 --> 06:17.038
What do you say? Let's call it a night.
You can go up and get some sleep.

06:17.122 --> 06:19.165
- Then in the morning...
- Wait.

06:19.249 --> 06:21.835
- What's the matter?
- It doesn't make sense.

06:21.877 --> 06:24.129
- Sure it does.
- No.

06:24.213 --> 06:27.341
- Where's the problem?
- The problem is...

06:27.383 --> 06:29.969
- You are crazy.
- So?

06:30.052 --> 06:34.473
So you said a crazy person
would never admit that.

06:35.099 --> 06:37.476
Ah. I see.

06:38.019 --> 06:40.396
So?

06:40.480 --> 06:44.525
- It's a point.
- So how can you admit it?

06:45.276 --> 06:47.444
Well, because...

06:49.072 --> 06:52.241
I'm also dead.

06:52.284 --> 06:54.619
Aren't I?

06:57.748 --> 07:02.127
- You died a week ago.
- Aneurysm. 63 years old.

07:02.211 --> 07:05.005
The funeral's tomorrow.

07:19.270 --> 07:20.479
Sorry.

07:20.563 --> 07:24.066
- Did I... Did I hurt you?
- No. It's OK.

07:24.150 --> 07:25.151
Good.

07:25.235 --> 07:28.279
Mr. Dobbs, you gonna stand there forever?

07:28.363 --> 07:30.448
This is my daughter Catherine.

07:30.532 --> 07:32.283
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:32.325 --> 07:34.660
Mr. Dobbs is in our infinite program.

07:34.745 --> 07:37.623
As he approaches completion
of his dissertation,

07:37.664 --> 07:39.666
time approaches infinity.

07:40.709 --> 07:43.253
- (man) Catherine?
- What?

07:43.337 --> 07:47.132
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say
I'm done for the night.

07:47.591 --> 07:49.175
Good.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.428
- Champagne, huh?
- Yes.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.014
- Celebrating?
- Do you want some?

07:54.098 --> 07:57.559
- Sure.
- I'm done. You can take the rest with you.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.020
Oh. Um...

08:00.104 --> 08:02.106
- No, thanks.
- Take it. I'm done.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.984
No. I'm driving. Um...

08:05.068 --> 08:08.404
- I'll let myself out.
- Good.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.699
- When should I come back?
- Come back?

08:11.783 --> 08:15.286
Yeah. I'm no way near finished.
Maybe tomorrow?

08:15.329 --> 08:17.956
We have a funeral tomorrow.

08:18.040 --> 08:22.836
You're right. I'm sorry.
I was going to attend, if that's all right.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.296
Sure.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.506
What about Sunday?
Will you be around?

08:26.590 --> 08:29.342
You've had three days.

08:29.427 --> 08:31.679
I know you don't need
anybody in your hair,

08:31.762 --> 08:34.514
but someone's got
to go through your dad's stuff.

08:34.599 --> 08:37.727
- There's nothing up there.
- There are 103 notebooks.

08:37.809 --> 08:40.938
He was a graphomaniac, Harold.
Do you know what that is?

08:41.022 --> 08:42.898
He wrote compulsively.
Call me Hal.

08:42.982 --> 08:46.610
It's like a monkey at a typewriter.
103 notebooks full of bullshit.

08:46.695 --> 08:49.155
I'm prepared to look at every page.
Are you?

08:49.239 --> 08:51.407
No.

08:51.491 --> 08:53.785
I'm not crazy.

08:56.914 --> 08:59.583
Well, I'm gonna be late.

08:59.666 --> 09:02.335
Some friends of mine are in this band.

09:02.378 --> 09:06.257
They're playing in a bar on Diversey,
way down the bill, around 2:30.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.884
- I said I'd be there.
- Great.

09:08.968 --> 09:11.637
They're all in the math department.
They're good.

09:11.721 --> 09:15.057
They have this song called "i."
You'd like it. Lowercase i.

09:15.141 --> 09:18.561
They just stand there.
They don't play anything for three minutes.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.563
Imaginary number?

09:20.605 --> 09:23.399
It's a math joke.
You see why they're way down the bill.

09:23.441 --> 09:26.485
That's a long drive
to see some nerds in a band.

09:26.570 --> 09:30.323
I hate when people say that.
It's not really that long of a drive.

09:30.407 --> 09:32.867
- So they are nerds.
- Oh, they're raging geeks.

09:32.951 --> 09:35.328
But they're geeks
who can dress themselves

09:35.412 --> 09:37.664
and hold down a job at a major university.

09:37.748 --> 09:41.209
Some of them have switched
from glasses to contacts.

09:41.293 --> 09:45.714
They play sports. They play in a band.
They get laid surprisingly often.

09:45.756 --> 09:48.967
So it makes you kind of question
the whole set of terms:

09:49.051 --> 09:53.096
"Geek," "nerd," "wonk,"
"Dilbert," "paste-eater."

09:54.098 --> 09:56.892
- You're in this band, aren't you?
- OK, yes.

09:56.935 --> 10:00.271
I play the drums. You wanna come?
I never sing. I swear to God.

10:00.313 --> 10:03.274
- No, thanks.
- All right, look. Catherine.

10:03.358 --> 10:05.693
- Monday. What do you say?
- Don't you have a job?

10:05.777 --> 10:09.697
- A full teaching load plus my own work.
- Plus band practice.

10:09.781 --> 10:13.034
- Plus I teach hockey to ten-year-olds.
- You make me sick.

10:13.118 --> 10:15.870
I don't have time to do this,
but I have to if you'll let me.

10:15.954 --> 10:19.833
I loved your dad, and I don't believe
a mind like his can just shut down.

10:19.917 --> 10:23.504
He had lucid moments, a lucid year,
a whole year three years ago.

10:23.587 --> 10:26.173
- Sorry.
- Look, let me...

10:26.257 --> 10:28.634
- Wait. You're 27, right?
- How old are you?

10:28.718 --> 10:30.636
- Doesn't matter.
- How old are you?

10:30.678 --> 10:33.889
I'm 26. When your dad
was younger than both of us,

10:33.973 --> 10:36.308
he made major contributions to three fields:

10:36.392 --> 10:39.979
- Game theory, algebraic geometry...
- Don't lecture me.

10:40.063 --> 10:42.565
If I came up with a tenth
of the shit your dad produced,

10:42.649 --> 10:47.487
I could write my ticket
to any math department in the country.

10:49.197 --> 10:51.407
Give me your backpack.

10:51.491 --> 10:53.451
Why?

10:53.494 --> 10:55.871
- Because I wanna look inside it.
- What?

10:55.954 --> 10:58.289
- Open it up and give it to me.
- Come on.

10:58.332 --> 11:01.335
- You're not taking anything out of here.
- I wouldn't.

11:01.377 --> 11:03.754
You're hoping to find something
you can publish?

11:03.838 --> 11:05.965
- Sure.
- Then you can write your own ticket?

11:06.048 --> 11:09.259
What? No, it would be
under your dad's name, for your dad.

11:09.343 --> 11:12.012
- You have something in that backpack.
- What...?

11:12.096 --> 11:14.932
- Give it to me!
- Look, you're being a little paranoid.

11:15.016 --> 11:18.644
Just because I'm paranoid
doesn't mean there isn't something in...

11:18.686 --> 11:24.442
You said yourself that there was
nothing up there, didn't you? Didn't you?

11:24.526 --> 11:27.946
- Yes.
- So what would I take, right?

11:29.072 --> 11:31.407
You're right.

11:31.491 --> 11:34.202
Thank you.

11:37.247 --> 11:39.582
Oh, what the hell...?

11:42.461 --> 11:45.339
This isn't an airport.

12:06.862 --> 12:09.197
You can come back.

12:18.499 --> 12:21.335
The University Health Service
is very good.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.505
I'm fine.

12:26.382 --> 12:30.344
Also... exercise is great.

12:30.428 --> 12:33.389
I go running along the lake
a couple mornings a week.

12:33.431 --> 12:35.516
It clears my head.
It's not too cold yet.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.019
If you wanted to,
I could pick you up.

12:38.103 --> 12:40.438
No, thanks.

12:40.522 --> 12:44.401
All right. Well, I'm gonna be
late for the show. I'd better go.

12:49.114 --> 12:51.324
Good night.

12:51.408 --> 12:54.244
- Wait. You forgot your jacket.
- Oh, no, you...

13:00.292 --> 13:03.211
I'm paranoid?
You think I should go jogging?

13:03.296 --> 13:05.965
- Just hold on.
- Get out. Get the hell out of my house!

13:06.048 --> 13:08.175
Let me explain.
I wanna show you something.

13:08.259 --> 13:09.718
- Give it back.
- Wait...

13:09.802 --> 13:11.929
- I'm calling the police.
- What? Don't.

13:11.971 --> 13:14.139
Look, I borrowed the book, all right?

13:14.224 --> 13:18.853
'Cause I found something your father
wrote. Not math. Just something he wrote.

13:18.937 --> 13:21.856
- I'd like to report a robbery.
- Put the phone down.

13:21.940 --> 13:23.358
- A robbery.
- It's about you.

13:23.442 --> 13:26.028
- He's in the house right now!
- Here's your name.

13:26.111 --> 13:29.489
- I'm at 4655 South...
- "Catherine," see? "Catherine."

13:29.531 --> 13:30.532
South...

13:30.616 --> 13:33.160
"Not a bad day.
Some good news from Catherine."

13:33.243 --> 13:36.287
I'm not sure what that meant.
I thought you might.

13:36.372 --> 13:39.375
- When did he write this?
- (woman) Ma'am?

13:39.458 --> 13:43.962
Three years ago. "Machinery's not working
yet, but there's cause for optimism."

13:44.046 --> 13:47.883
The machinery is what he called his mind,
his ability to do mathematics.

13:47.967 --> 13:50.386
I know.

13:50.470 --> 13:54.098
"Talking with students helps,
so does riding in buses.

13:54.182 --> 13:56.225
"Most of all Cathy.

13:58.687 --> 14:03.400
"Her refusal to let me be institutionalized,
caring for me herself,

14:03.483 --> 14:05.985
"has certainly saved my life.

14:08.530 --> 14:11.449
"Made writing this possible.

14:11.533 --> 14:15.537
"Made it possible
to imagine doing math again.

14:16.455 --> 14:18.832
"Where does her strength come from?

14:18.874 --> 14:22.461
"I can never repay her.
Today is her birthday.

14:22.545 --> 14:26.173
"She is 24.
I'm taking her to dinner."

14:28.551 --> 14:30.928
So what are we going
to do on your birthday?

14:31.012 --> 14:34.223
- Dad...
- Let's get the hell out of this neighborhood.

14:34.265 --> 14:38.978
Let's go to the North side or Chinatown.
Greektown. I don't know what's good.

14:39.062 --> 14:41.022
- Dad?
- Hmm?

14:41.982 --> 14:44.734
I'm going to school.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.070
When?

14:47.154 --> 14:51.116
I'm gonna start at Northwestern
at the end of the month.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.202
Northwestern?

14:54.411 --> 15:00.375
I shouldn't have tried to sneak it out. I know
it sounds stupid, but I was gonna wrap it.

15:05.590 --> 15:07.925
Happy birthday.

15:14.766 --> 15:17.101
What's wrong with Chicago?

15:18.437 --> 15:20.564
You still teach there.

15:20.647 --> 15:26.111
I'm sorry. That is too weird,
me taking classes in your department.

15:26.153 --> 15:29.573
- It's a long drive.
- It's not that long. It's half an hour.

15:29.615 --> 15:31.950
Still, twice a day.

15:32.034 --> 15:34.453
Dad.

15:34.537 --> 15:37.415
I'd live there.

15:37.456 --> 15:40.792
You'd actually want
to live in Evanston?

15:40.877 --> 15:45.423
I'd still be close.
I can come home whenever you want.

15:46.174 --> 15:47.758
Look...

15:47.800 --> 15:51.637
You've been well. You've been really well
for almost seven months now.

15:51.721 --> 15:55.975
I don't think you need me here
every minute of the day.

16:00.022 --> 16:02.190
(sirens)

16:16.872 --> 16:19.541
- Yes?
- Someone here call the police?

16:25.423 --> 16:26.841
(woman) No, honey.

16:26.883 --> 16:32.513
I think we should put the aqua plates
on the registry and the brown couch.

16:32.597 --> 16:35.600
Your mother wants to buy us
a substantial piece of furniture,

16:35.684 --> 16:40.272
and that's the biggest thing that I could find
that will fit in our apartment.

16:40.355 --> 16:45.151
Well, then, don't worry about it, honey.
I'll be home by tomorrow night.

16:45.194 --> 16:48.322
Yeah, let's just get through today first.
Hold on a second.

16:48.405 --> 16:49.614
Hi!

16:49.698 --> 16:51.658
Huh? Um...

16:51.742 --> 16:54.828
I don't know.
She didn't pick up when I called.

16:54.912 --> 16:57.998
Hopefully better than yesterday.

16:58.082 --> 17:02.628
First thing I'm gonna do is throw her into
the shower and get her out in the sun.

17:07.675 --> 17:10.511
- Better. Much.
- Thanks.

17:10.553 --> 17:12.762
- You feel better?
- Yep.

17:12.848 --> 17:14.974
You look a million times better.

17:15.934 --> 17:18.269
- Have some coffee.
- OK.

17:19.313 --> 17:22.773
- No. Black.
- Have a little milk.

17:29.073 --> 17:32.076
- Have a banana.
- No. Thank you.

17:33.202 --> 17:36.080
Good thing I brought food.
There is nothing in the house.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.499
I've been meaning to go shopping.

17:38.583 --> 17:42.295
- Do you want a bagel?
- No. I hate breakfast.

17:46.091 --> 17:50.011
- Coffee.
- Still making those lists, huh?

17:50.095 --> 17:52.097
It's... It's a compulsion.

17:53.807 --> 17:58.311
Do you ever cheat and tick off something
you haven't actually done yet?

17:58.395 --> 18:01.106
Well, I would only be cheating myself.

18:01.774 --> 18:03.400
Right.

18:04.944 --> 18:07.571
Did you use that
conditioner I brought you?

18:07.613 --> 18:10.574
- No. Shit. I forgot.
- Well, it's my favorite.

18:10.616 --> 18:12.784
You'll love it, Katie.
I want you to try it.

18:12.868 --> 18:16.955
- I'll try it next time.
- You'll like it. It has jojoba.

18:17.665 --> 18:19.833
What is jojoba?

18:19.917 --> 18:23.086
It's something they put in
for healthy hair.

18:23.129 --> 18:26.173
- Hair is dead.
- What?

18:26.257 --> 18:29.343
It's... It's dead tissue.
You can't make it healthy.

18:29.427 --> 18:33.222
- Whatever. It's good for your hair.
- Like what? A chemical?

18:33.306 --> 18:37.268
- No. It's organic.
- It can be organic and still be a chemical.

18:37.352 --> 18:40.146
- I don't know what it is.
- Heard of organic chemistry?

18:40.230 --> 18:43.358
It makes my hair look,
smell and feel good,

18:43.442 --> 18:45.944
and that is the extent
of my information about it.

18:46.028 --> 18:49.323
You might like it
if you decide to use it.

18:49.365 --> 18:51.909
Thanks. I'll try it.

18:54.370 --> 19:00.167
If you don't have anything to wear for
today, we could go shopping downtown.

19:00.251 --> 19:01.293
OK.

19:01.377 --> 19:04.546
It'll be fun.
My birthday present.

19:04.631 --> 19:06.925
Great.

19:07.008 --> 19:09.844
Is there anything else you need?

19:09.928 --> 19:11.304
No. I'm cool.

19:11.346 --> 19:13.932
- Anything at all while I'm here?
- Uh-uh.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.228
I thought we'd have
some people over tonight.

19:18.312 --> 19:20.689
If you're feeling OK.

19:20.731 --> 19:23.358
We are burying Dad this afternoon.

19:23.442 --> 19:27.154
You have to have something.
People expect it.

19:27.196 --> 19:31.742
And it's the only time I can see
any old Chicago friends. It'll be nice.

19:31.826 --> 19:36.038
I think Dad would've
wanted us to have a good time.

19:36.122 --> 19:40.543
It's a funeral, but we don't
have to be completely grim about it.

19:45.507 --> 19:48.426
- (Claire) Mitch says hi.
- (Catherine) Hi, Mitch.

19:48.510 --> 19:52.764
He sends you his love.
I told him you would see him soon, and...

19:52.848 --> 19:55.058
- We're getting married.
- No shit.

19:55.142 --> 19:57.811
- Yes. We just decided.
- Yikes.

19:57.895 --> 19:58.896
Yes.

19:58.979 --> 20:01.356
- Oh. When?
- In January.

20:01.899 --> 20:04.401
You know, his job is great.

20:04.485 --> 20:06.069
I just got promoted.

20:06.529 --> 20:08.697
Huh.

20:08.781 --> 20:12.993
- You will come?
- Yeah. Sure. In January?

20:14.162 --> 20:17.957
I mean, it's not like I have
to check my schedule or anything. Sure.

20:18.583 --> 20:21.127
- Do you know what you wanna do now?
- No.

20:21.211 --> 20:23.922
- Do you wanna stay in Chicago?
- I don't know.

20:24.005 --> 20:27.925
- Do you wanna go back to school?
- I haven't thought about it.

20:28.009 --> 20:31.053
Well, there's a lot to think about.

20:31.096 --> 20:34.432
- How do you feel?
- Physically? Great.

20:34.474 --> 20:37.518
Except my hair seems unhealthy.
I wish there was something...

20:37.603 --> 20:42.733
- Come on, Catherine.
- What is the point of all these questions?

20:42.817 --> 20:48.030
Katie, some police officers came by
while you were in the shower.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.241
Yeah?

20:50.283 --> 20:55.455
They said they were checking up on things
and wanted to see how everything was.

20:55.538 --> 20:58.082
That was nice of them.
What about this?

20:58.124 --> 21:01.460
They said they responded to a call
last night and came to the house.

21:01.503 --> 21:03.421
Yeah?

21:03.463 --> 21:05.798
- Did you call the police last night?
- Yeah.

21:05.882 --> 21:07.633
Why?

21:07.718 --> 21:10.887
Because I thought
the house was being robbed.

21:10.971 --> 21:15.308
- But it wasn't?
- No. I changed my mind.

21:15.350 --> 21:18.895
The police told me you seemed
disoriented and abusive.

21:18.979 --> 21:21.314
These guys were assholes, Claire.

21:21.357 --> 21:24.151
- They seemed perfectly nice.
- They wouldn't leave.

21:24.193 --> 21:26.737
They wanted me to, like, fill out a report.

21:26.821 --> 21:28.697
Were you abusive?

21:28.781 --> 21:33.452
This one cop kept spitting on me
when he talked. It was disgusting.

21:33.494 --> 21:36.330
Did you use the word "dickhead"?

21:36.414 --> 21:38.124
I don't remember.

21:38.166 --> 21:42.420
Did you tell one cop to go...
have sex with the other cop's mother?

21:42.504 --> 21:43.546
No.

21:43.630 --> 21:47.634
- That's what they said.
- Not with that phrasing.

21:47.676 --> 21:51.096
- Did you strike one of them?
- They were trying to come into the house.

21:51.180 --> 21:53.807
- Oh, my God.
- No! I might have pushed him a little.

21:53.891 --> 21:58.479
- They said you seemed disturbed.
- They were trying to search my house!

21:58.520 --> 22:00.271
- You called them.
- Yes.

22:00.356 --> 22:03.525
But I didn't actually want them to come.

22:03.609 --> 22:05.652
So why did you call?

22:05.695 --> 22:09.991
Because I was trying
to get this guy out of the house.

22:10.950 --> 22:13.494
- What is this man's name?
- Hal.

22:13.578 --> 22:15.621
Harold. Harold Dobbs.

22:15.705 --> 22:20.376
Because the police said
that you were the only person there.

22:20.460 --> 22:23.671
- Because he left before they got there.
- With the notebooks?

22:23.713 --> 22:27.884
No, Claire, don't be stupid.
There are over a hundred notebooks.

22:27.968 --> 22:31.388
He was only stealing one.
But he was stealing it to give it back to me.

22:31.430 --> 22:35.309
So I let him go so he could play with his
band on the north side. What about this?

22:35.392 --> 22:37.727
- His band?
- He was late.

22:38.437 --> 22:42.399
He wanted me to come with him.
I was like, "Yeah, right."

22:42.483 --> 22:45.402
Is Harold Dobbs your boyfriend?

22:45.486 --> 22:47.029
No.

22:47.113 --> 22:49.448
- Are you sleeping with him?
- Ew!

22:49.532 --> 22:51.784
No. He's a math geek.

22:51.868 --> 22:54.620
And he's in a band?
A rock band?

22:54.704 --> 22:57.498
No. A marching band.
He plays trombone.

22:57.582 --> 23:00.710
Yes. A rock band.

23:00.794 --> 23:04.881
- What is the name of this band?
- How should I know?

23:04.923 --> 23:08.134
Harold Dobbs didn't tell you
the name of his rock band?

23:08.218 --> 23:09.511
No.

23:10.137 --> 23:12.097
Well, is Harold Dobbs...?

23:12.181 --> 23:15.976
- Stop saying "Harold Dobbs."
- Is this person...?

23:16.060 --> 23:20.356
- Harold Dobbs exists.
- I'm sure he does.

23:20.439 --> 23:23.317
He's a mathematician at
the University of Chicago.

23:23.401 --> 23:25.319
Call the freaking math department.

23:29.198 --> 23:33.243
(Claire) Mitch has become
an excellent cook. It's like his hobby now.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.371
He buys all these gadgets:

23:35.455 --> 23:38.124
Garlic press, olive oil sprayer.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.376
Every night there's something new.

23:40.460 --> 23:44.088
The other day he made vegetarian chili.

23:45.299 --> 23:47.634
What are you talking about?

23:47.676 --> 23:50.303
Stay with us for a while.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.055
I'm OK here.

23:52.139 --> 23:55.600
Chicago is dead.
New York is so much more fun.

23:55.684 --> 24:00.397
Well, the fun thing is not really
where my head's at at the moment.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.941
- You look so tired.
- I am.

24:02.984 --> 24:05.903
- I just think you could use some downtime.
- Downtime?

24:05.987 --> 24:07.989
Katie, please, you've had a hard time.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.075
- I'm perfectly OK.
- I think you're upset and exhausted.

24:11.159 --> 24:13.494
I was fine until you got here.

24:13.578 --> 24:14.871
Wait.

24:15.956 --> 24:18.166
(Hal) Catherine!

24:18.250 --> 24:20.585
(Claire) Who is that?

24:24.923 --> 24:27.300
Harold Dobbs!

24:27.801 --> 24:29.469
Hi.

24:29.553 --> 24:31.221
OK?

24:32.848 --> 24:35.183
I really don't need this, Claire.

24:35.267 --> 24:40.230
I'm fine, you know. I'm totally fine. And then
you show up here with these questions.

24:40.314 --> 24:44.401
Like, "Are you OK?" with that
soothing tone of voice. And... Oh.

24:44.485 --> 24:49.198
The poor policemen. I think
the policemen can handle themselves.

24:49.282 --> 24:52.201
And bagels and bananas and jojoba.

24:52.285 --> 24:55.955
And "Come to New York."
And vegetarian chili!

24:57.165 --> 25:00.877
I mean, it really pisses me off,
so just save it.

25:02.546 --> 25:06.717
- I'm Claire. I'm Catherine's sister.
- Oh, hi. Hal. Nice to meet you.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.719
So he had to go back
and fix the paper in galleys.

25:09.762 --> 25:13.849
He pretty much held it
together with baling wire.

25:14.600 --> 25:19.438
This is a man who,
back in the UK, at the age of 22,

25:19.522 --> 25:24.777
basically invented the mathematical
techniques for studying rational behavior

25:24.861 --> 25:31.618
and gave the astrophysicists plenty
to think about when he came over here.

25:31.701 --> 25:37.039
Men like Robert Llewellyn
come into the world very rarely.

25:38.041 --> 25:42.587
And we will miss the man...
intensely.

25:42.671 --> 25:47.217
But... the work will endure.

25:54.433 --> 25:58.895
(Mozart's Quartet for Strings in C)

26:16.456 --> 26:19.417
I'm not on the program.

26:23.130 --> 26:26.008
Wow.

26:26.091 --> 26:31.596
I can't believe how many people are here.
I never knew he had this many friends.

26:31.680 --> 26:35.392
Where have you all been
for the last five years?

26:36.394 --> 26:39.772
I guess to you guys
he was already dead, right?

26:40.982 --> 26:44.944
I mean, what's a great man
without his greatness?

26:45.028 --> 26:47.322
Just some old guy.

26:49.115 --> 26:53.244
So you probably wanna catch up
on what you missed out on.

26:53.328 --> 26:55.163
Um...

26:55.247 --> 27:00.377
He used to read all day.
He kept demanding more and more books.

27:00.460 --> 27:06.090
I was getting them out of the library
by the carload. There were hundreds.

27:06.175 --> 27:09.803
And then one day I realized
he wasn't reading.

27:11.389 --> 27:14.934
He believed aliens
were sending him messages

27:15.017 --> 27:17.603
through the Dewey decimal numbers
in the books.

27:17.687 --> 27:20.356
He was trying to work out the code.

27:22.358 --> 27:27.404
He used to shuffle around in his slippers.

27:27.489 --> 27:29.866
He talked to himself.

27:30.700 --> 27:33.077
He stank.

27:33.912 --> 27:39.417
I had to make sure he bathed,
which was embarrassing.

27:39.501 --> 27:43.213
Then he started writing
19, 20 hours a day.

27:43.297 --> 27:48.343
I got him this huge case of notebooks.
He used every one.

27:48.385 --> 27:50.679
I dropped out of school.

27:54.183 --> 27:56.769
You see, he was convinced that...

27:57.770 --> 28:02.232
he was writing the most beautiful,
elegant proofs.

28:03.693 --> 28:06.028
Proofs like music.

28:12.619 --> 28:15.413
I'm glad he's dead.

28:19.585 --> 28:22.504
(Claire whispering) Catherine.
Catherine.

28:36.310 --> 28:38.854
Catherine.

28:43.067 --> 28:45.527
Don't call the cops.

28:45.612 --> 28:48.239
I can't believe I just said that.

28:48.657 --> 28:52.285
No, it definitely pushed the envelope.

28:54.788 --> 28:57.832
- I think I need to go home.
- Then I'll drive you.

28:57.916 --> 29:00.126
No, that's OK.
I'm gonna walk.

29:00.210 --> 29:02.420
It's a long walk.

29:02.463 --> 29:04.131
Thanks.

29:16.227 --> 29:19.855
Their day care is excellent.
We're starting to apply for preschools now,

29:19.939 --> 29:22.650
which locks you into a commitment.

29:23.651 --> 29:24.860
It does?

29:24.944 --> 29:27.321
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:27.405 --> 29:29.782
- Do you ever miss Chicago?
- No.

29:31.076 --> 29:32.494
I mean, uh...

29:32.577 --> 29:34.412
Um...

29:34.496 --> 29:36.456
- No.
- You have the house now, though.

29:36.540 --> 29:40.419
You and Mitch should move back
and fix it up.

29:40.502 --> 29:43.463
You look great.

29:43.506 --> 29:45.716
Claire gave it to me.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.177
I... I like it.

29:48.219 --> 29:50.429
It doesn't really fit.

29:50.513 --> 29:52.097
Sure it does.

29:53.724 --> 29:55.308
You can't prove it.

29:55.393 --> 29:58.771
Well, I can try and disprove the opposite.

29:58.855 --> 30:01.190
I can prove that it doesn't not fit.

30:01.274 --> 30:02.733
How?

30:02.817 --> 30:05.444
I could take a vote.

30:06.488 --> 30:09.157
To your old man.
Hell of a guy.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.408
Thank you.

30:10.492 --> 30:12.869
Too bad he went nuts.

30:12.911 --> 30:14.871
Hell of a guy anyway.

30:14.955 --> 30:17.624
- What do you do?
- I'm a currency analyst.

30:17.708 --> 30:22.045
I probably inherited
one thousandth of my father's talent.

30:22.129 --> 30:24.673
- Are you a mathematician?
- Ooh. Christ, no.

30:24.757 --> 30:27.468
- Theoretical phys-physics.
- (Claire laughs)

30:27.551 --> 30:30.679
- To the physicists.
- Drink up.

30:32.098 --> 30:33.891
When do you think they'll leave?

30:33.933 --> 30:37.728
No way to know.
Mathematicians are insane.

30:37.770 --> 30:42.858
I went to this conference in Toronto last fall.
I have never been so exhausted in my life.

30:42.901 --> 30:47.530
48 straight hours of
partying, drinking, drugs, papers, lectures.

30:47.614 --> 30:49.657
- Drugs?
- Amphetamines mostly.

30:49.741 --> 30:53.161
I don't. Some older guys, they're hooked.
They think they need it.

30:53.245 --> 30:54.371
Why?

30:54.455 --> 30:59.543
There's this fear that your creativity peaks
around 23, then it's all downhill from there.

30:59.627 --> 31:01.170
That's what my dad thought.

31:01.253 --> 31:05.841
I guess all the really original work,
it's... all young guys.

31:05.925 --> 31:09.303
- Young guys?
- No, there are some women.

31:09.387 --> 31:11.055
Really? Who?

31:11.097 --> 31:14.308
There's a woman at Stanford.
I can't remember her name.

31:14.392 --> 31:16.060
Sophie Germain?

31:16.144 --> 31:21.482
Yeah. I think I've seen her at meetings,
but I don't think I've ever met her.

31:21.566 --> 31:24.735
She was born in Paris in 1776.

31:25.487 --> 31:28.406
Then I've definitely never met her.

31:30.284 --> 31:32.828
Ah, I'm... Sophie Germain.

31:32.911 --> 31:37.207
- I'm stupid. Germain primes.
- Right.

31:37.291 --> 31:39.501
Double them, add one,
you get another prime.

31:39.585 --> 31:42.421
Like two is prime,
double plus one is five, also prime.

31:42.463 --> 31:44.631
Right.

31:44.715 --> 31:50.679
Or 92,305 times two
to the 16,998th plus one.

31:50.763 --> 31:51.847
Right.

31:51.931 --> 31:55.768
That's the biggest one,
the biggest known one.

31:57.145 --> 31:59.063
(man) Coming through!

31:59.606 --> 32:02.567
Oh, what the hell are they doing here?

32:46.697 --> 32:48.031
OK.

32:48.073 --> 32:52.369
Now we'd like to play a song
in tribute to a great man,

32:52.411 --> 32:54.663
a great mathematician.

32:56.373 --> 32:58.667
It's called "i."

33:00.753 --> 33:04.089
One, two, one, two, three...

33:41.879 --> 33:45.716
(Hal) You're probably right.
That book I stole?

33:45.758 --> 33:51.222
I'm starting to think it's the only lucid one,
and there's no math in it.

33:51.306 --> 33:53.266
No.

33:53.308 --> 33:55.310
I mean, I'll keep reading,

33:55.393 --> 33:58.854
but if I can't find anything
in the next couple of days...

33:58.939 --> 34:01.566
Back to the hockey rink?

34:01.650 --> 34:03.276
Yep.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.528
And your own research.

34:06.446 --> 34:09.324
Such as it is.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.369
What's wrong with it?

34:13.286 --> 34:15.581
The big ideas aren't there.

34:16.456 --> 34:20.793
Well, it's not about big ideas.
It's... It's work.

34:20.878 --> 34:23.088
You got to chip away at a problem.

34:23.547 --> 34:28.094
- That's not what your dad did.
- I think it was, in a way.

34:29.429 --> 34:35.101
I mean, he'd attack a problem from the
side, you know, from some weird angle.

34:35.185 --> 34:37.687
Sneak up on it, grind away at it.

34:40.273 --> 34:41.940
I don't know.

34:41.984 --> 34:44.987
I don't know. I'm just guessing.

34:45.070 --> 34:47.197
I enjoy teaching.

34:47.281 --> 34:50.784
- You might come up with something.
- It's not gonna happen. I'm 26.

34:50.826 --> 34:53.286
Remember the downward slope?

34:53.913 --> 34:57.625
- Have you tried speed? I heard it helps.
- Yeah.

35:10.513 --> 35:12.389
So...

35:13.391 --> 35:16.185
This is my room.

35:26.572 --> 35:30.033
Wow. You read a lot of math.

35:30.868 --> 35:35.247
No. I read Cosmo.
That's just window dressing.

35:36.540 --> 35:40.794
You're a mysterious person, Catherine.
You know that?

35:41.796 --> 35:44.340
You want a drink?

35:44.424 --> 35:45.842
I'm OK.

35:45.883 --> 35:48.719
We never got
to celebrate your birthday.

35:50.221 --> 35:51.472
OK.

36:01.441 --> 36:02.567
Um...

36:02.651 --> 36:05.946
I'm sorry. I just...
I'm a little drunk.

36:06.739 --> 36:08.699
It's OK.

36:22.088 --> 36:24.632
I'm a little out of practice.

36:29.429 --> 36:31.556
I always liked you.

36:31.640 --> 36:34.935
- You did?
- But then I thought:

36:35.018 --> 36:38.438
"You don't flirt
with your doctoral adviser's daughter."

36:38.522 --> 36:41.108
Especially when your adviser's crazy?

36:41.191 --> 36:43.401
Especially then.

36:46.280 --> 36:49.658
I saw you at my dad's office once.
Do you remember?

36:49.742 --> 36:52.453
I can't believe you remember that.

36:52.536 --> 36:55.080
I remember you.

36:55.122 --> 36:57.249
I thought that you seemed...

36:58.417 --> 37:01.086
not boring.

37:14.893 --> 37:17.103
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:18.522 --> 37:21.108
Oh, I feel like
I'm gonna crack open like...

37:21.150 --> 37:23.193
Like what?

37:23.277 --> 37:25.988
An egg.

37:26.071 --> 37:28.490
Or one of those really
smelly French cheeses

37:28.532 --> 37:31.993
that ooze out everywhere
when you cut them.

37:32.036 --> 37:34.163
Nice.

39:04.215 --> 39:06.258
Catherine.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.339
How long have you been up?

39:43.423 --> 39:45.758
A while.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.179
Is your sister up?

39:50.263 --> 39:52.723
No.

39:52.808 --> 39:56.728
Her flight leaves in a couple of hours.
I should probably wake her.

39:56.812 --> 39:59.272
Let her sleep.
She did some serious drinking

39:59.314 --> 40:02.734
with the theoretical physicists last night.

40:05.279 --> 40:08.448
I'll make her some coffee
when she gets up.

40:08.532 --> 40:13.787
Sunday mornings I usually go out,
get the paper, have some breakfast.

40:14.831 --> 40:16.457
OK.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.960
Do you wanna come?

40:20.003 --> 40:22.046
Oh.

40:22.130 --> 40:25.133
Well, I should probably stick around
until Claire leaves.

40:25.217 --> 40:26.885
OK.

40:29.846 --> 40:32.724
Do you mind if I stay?

40:32.808 --> 40:34.476
No.

40:36.311 --> 40:38.479
You can work if you want.

40:38.522 --> 40:40.649
All right.

40:41.984 --> 40:44.069
- Should I?
- You can if you want to.

40:44.153 --> 40:46.405
- Do you want me to go?
- Do you wanna go?

40:46.489 --> 40:49.742
- I wanna stay here with you.
- Oh.

40:49.826 --> 40:52.328
Wanna spend the day with you,
if at all possible.

40:52.370 --> 40:54.747
I wanna spend
as much time with you as I can,

40:54.831 --> 40:57.417
unless I'm coming on way too strong
and scaring you,

40:57.500 --> 41:02.129
in which case
I'll begin back-pedaling immediately.

41:13.725 --> 41:18.229
How embarrassing is it if I say
last night was wonderful?

41:18.314 --> 41:21.901
It's only embarrassing
if I don't agree.

41:22.401 --> 41:24.695
So?

41:24.737 --> 41:27.072
Don't be embarrassed.

41:34.706 --> 41:36.874
What?

41:45.675 --> 41:47.051
Here.

41:51.807 --> 41:55.560
The drawer in the desk
in my dad's office.

41:55.602 --> 41:57.937
What's in there?

42:05.363 --> 42:07.365
Now?

42:39.899 --> 42:43.861
- Good morning.
- Please, don't yell. Please.

42:43.945 --> 42:46.447
- Are you all right?
- No.

42:46.489 --> 42:49.492
- Theoretical physicists.
- What happened?

42:49.575 --> 42:52.786
Thanks a lot for
leaving me alone with them.

42:53.746 --> 42:55.789
That band.

42:55.874 --> 42:56.875
Yeah.

42:56.958 --> 43:02.004
- They were terrible.
- They were OK. They had fun, I think.

43:02.088 --> 43:06.384
Well, as long as everybody had fun.
Your dress turned out all right.

43:06.468 --> 43:09.220
- I love it.
- You do?

43:09.304 --> 43:11.306
Yeah. It's wonderful.

43:11.390 --> 43:14.643
- I was surprised you even wore it.
- I love it, Claire.

43:14.727 --> 43:16.270
Thanks.

43:17.021 --> 43:20.190
You're welcome.
Well, you're in a good mood.

43:21.192 --> 43:24.653
- Should I not be?
- Are you kidding? No, I'm thrilled.

43:24.737 --> 43:26.613
It's just... I...

43:26.697 --> 43:29.074
Hold on a second, Katie.
I just...

43:30.076 --> 43:33.537
- I'm leaving soon, and...
- I know. You said.

43:33.580 --> 43:36.291
I would still like you
to come to New York.

43:36.374 --> 43:39.001
Yes. January.

43:40.462 --> 43:44.591
I would like you to move to New York.

43:45.342 --> 43:46.843
Move?

43:46.885 --> 43:50.805
You could stay with me and Mitch at first,
and then you could get your own place.

43:50.889 --> 43:55.769
I've already scouted some apartments
for you. Really cute places.

43:55.853 --> 43:57.855
What would I do in New York?

43:57.938 --> 44:01.942
You could do whatever you want. You
could work. You could go back to school.

44:02.026 --> 44:04.320
I don't know, Claire,
this is pretty major.

44:04.403 --> 44:07.364
I realize that.

44:07.448 --> 44:09.783
I know you mean well, OK?

44:10.994 --> 44:13.663
Well, to be honest,
you were right yesterday.

44:13.747 --> 44:16.291
It's been a pretty weird couple of years,

44:16.374 --> 44:20.044
and I think I'd just like to take some time
and figure things out.

44:20.128 --> 44:24.799
But it would be much easier for me to get
you set up in an apartment in New York.

44:24.883 --> 44:27.510
I don't need an apartment.
I'll stay in the house.

44:27.594 --> 44:30.221
We're selling the house.

44:30.639 --> 44:32.182
What?

44:32.266 --> 44:36.687
I'm hoping to do the paperwork this week.
I know that seems sudden.

44:36.771 --> 44:40.107
No one was here looking at the place.
Who are you selling it to?

44:40.149 --> 44:43.318
The university.
They've wanted it back for years.

44:43.402 --> 44:44.653
I live here.

44:44.737 --> 44:47.197
Come to New York.
We'll have so much fun.

44:47.282 --> 44:49.617
- I don't believe this.
- It would be so good.

44:49.701 --> 44:53.913
You deserve a change. This would be
a whole new adventure for you.

44:53.955 --> 44:56.666
- Why are you doing this?
- I want to help.

44:56.750 --> 44:59.002
By kicking me out of my house?

44:59.920 --> 45:03.548
- This is my house, too.
- Please! You haven't lived here for years.

45:03.632 --> 45:08.804
I know that. You were on your own. I really
regret that, Katie. And now I want to help.

45:08.887 --> 45:10.597
You wanna help now?

45:10.681 --> 45:12.307
Yes.

45:13.559 --> 45:15.185
Dad is dead.

45:15.269 --> 45:16.853
- I know.
- He's dead.

45:16.937 --> 45:21.399
Now that he's dead, you fly in for
the weekend and decide you wanna help?

45:21.484 --> 45:26.572
You're late. Where have you been?
Where were you five years ago?

45:26.656 --> 45:29.492
- I was working.
- I was here.

45:29.576 --> 45:32.370
I lived with him alone.

45:32.454 --> 45:35.415
I was working 14-hour days.

45:35.498 --> 45:40.211
I paid off the mortgage on this house while
living in a studio apartment in Brooklyn.

45:40.295 --> 45:42.672
You had a life.
You got to finish school.

45:42.756 --> 45:44.841
- You could've finished school.
- How?

45:44.925 --> 45:47.969
I told you a million times
to do anything you wanted.

45:48.053 --> 45:51.514
- And what about Dad?
- He was ill.

45:51.599 --> 45:55.019
He should've been in a full-time
professional care situation.

45:55.061 --> 45:57.939
He didn't belong in the nuthouse.

45:58.022 --> 46:03.235
- He might have been better off.
- He needed to be here in his own house,

46:03.319 --> 46:05.696
near everything
that made him happy.

46:05.780 --> 46:07.323
Maybe.

46:07.365 --> 46:10.993
Or maybe some real professional care
would have done him more good

46:11.077 --> 46:14.580
than rattling around in this mausoleum
with you looking after him.

46:14.664 --> 46:18.543
What about his remission? Three years
ago, he was healthy for almost a year.

46:18.627 --> 46:22.088
- Then he went downhill again.
- He might have been worse in a hospital.

46:22.172 --> 46:26.509
He might have been better.
Did he ever do any work again?

46:26.552 --> 46:29.471
- No.
- No. And you might have been better.

46:31.974 --> 46:35.018
Better... than what?

46:35.102 --> 46:37.187
You had so much talent.

46:39.315 --> 46:42.276
You think I'm like Dad.

46:42.360 --> 46:45.404
I think you have some of his talent

46:45.488 --> 46:49.617
and some of his tendency
toward instability.

46:49.701 --> 46:52.078
Claire.

46:52.162 --> 46:57.292
In addition to the cute apartments
that you've scouted for me in New York,

46:57.376 --> 47:00.754
have you by any chance devoted
some of your considerable energies

47:00.838 --> 47:05.718
towards scouting out another type of living
facility for your bughouse little sister?

47:05.759 --> 47:08.553
No. Absolutely not.
That is not what this is about.

47:08.637 --> 47:10.972
Don't lie to me, Claire.

47:11.974 --> 47:14.643
- The resources that I've investigated...
- My God.

47:14.727 --> 47:18.898
If you wanted. All I'm saying is, the doctors
and the people in New York are the best.

47:18.940 --> 47:21.275
- Jesus!
- You wouldn't have to live...

47:21.359 --> 47:22.652
- I hate you!
- Don't yell.

47:22.735 --> 47:25.404
- I hate you!
- (footsteps)

47:25.447 --> 47:28.575
What are you doing here?

47:28.658 --> 47:31.577
How long have you known about this?

47:31.620 --> 47:33.830
A while.

47:34.289 --> 47:36.457
Why didn't you tell me about it?

47:36.541 --> 47:38.960
I wasn't sure if I wanted to.

47:41.130 --> 47:43.882
Thank you.

47:43.966 --> 47:46.760
You're welcome.

47:46.802 --> 47:50.013
- What's going on?
- Catherine, thank you.

47:50.097 --> 47:52.391
- I thought you might like to see it.
- What is it?

47:52.475 --> 47:54.185
- It's incredible.
- What is it?

47:54.268 --> 47:56.311
Oh, it's a result, a proof.

47:56.395 --> 47:59.898
It looks like a proof. It is a proof.
A very long proof.

47:59.983 --> 48:04.487
I haven't read through it all yet or checked
it. I don't even know if I could check it.

48:04.571 --> 48:10.243
But if it's a proof of what I think
it's a proof of, it's a very important proof.

48:10.327 --> 48:11.786
What does it prove?

48:11.870 --> 48:16.374
It looks like it proves a mathematical
theorem about prime numbers

48:16.458 --> 48:20.629
which mathematicians have been trying
to prove since there were mathematicians.

48:20.712 --> 48:23.673
You know about this?

48:23.757 --> 48:27.719
- Is it any good?
- It's historic, if it checks out.

48:27.803 --> 48:30.972
What does it mean?

48:31.015 --> 48:33.893
It means that when everybody
thought your dad was crazy,

48:33.976 --> 48:36.520
he did some of the most
important mathematics ever.

48:36.604 --> 48:40.649
If it checks out, it means you publish
instantly. You hold press conferences.

48:40.733 --> 48:42.985
It means that all newspapers
around the world

48:43.027 --> 48:46.155
are gonna want to talk to the person
who found this notebook.

48:46.239 --> 48:49.367
- Catherine.
- Catherine.

48:49.451 --> 48:51.828
I didn't find it.

48:51.870 --> 48:54.289
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

48:55.290 --> 48:57.917
- Did you find it or did Hal find it?
- I didn't find it.

48:58.001 --> 49:00.211
I didn't find it.

49:02.881 --> 49:05.091
I wrote it.

49:28.408 --> 49:30.159
- Hey, guys.
- Where you headed?

49:30.243 --> 49:33.830
- I'm late for Bhandari.
- You know what he's like. Better get there.

49:33.914 --> 49:36.833
Catch you later.

49:50.181 --> 49:52.224
(man) Yeah.

49:53.267 --> 49:55.519
Ah. Catherine.

49:55.603 --> 49:59.148
- So nice of you to drop by.
- Sorry I'm late.

50:01.109 --> 50:03.736
- This work of yours...
- I know. I'm sorry.

50:03.778 --> 50:06.697
- I mean, it's interesting.
- You think so?

50:06.781 --> 50:10.368
In that it has nothing to do with
the problems I'd asked you to solve.

50:10.452 --> 50:12.412
- It won't happen again.
- What happened?

50:12.496 --> 50:14.873
You simply couldn't control yourself?

50:14.957 --> 50:20.087
No. I just... I thought I should get all those
ideas down while they were in my head,

50:20.170 --> 50:24.132
and then it was morning,
and I couldn't come in with nothing.

50:24.175 --> 50:27.553
But this is the third time
that inspiration's overtaken you

50:27.637 --> 50:31.390
just at the moment when
you had to submit to my idea

50:31.474 --> 50:33.601
of what it is you should be learning.

50:33.643 --> 50:37.438
- A third? Really.
- Differential equations don't interest you.

50:37.480 --> 50:40.858
No, they do. I mean...
Yeah, they absolutely do.

50:40.942 --> 50:43.611
Oh, but they didn't last night.

50:43.653 --> 50:45.738
Not as much as usual.

50:49.743 --> 50:51.995
I mean...

50:52.079 --> 50:56.250
I'm worried that your work
is deteriorating.

50:56.333 --> 51:03.924
There are some good ideas here, but...
it isn't a coherent mathematical argument.

51:04.008 --> 51:08.637
- Well, I didn't get time to finish it.
- But mathematics isn't jazz.

51:08.679 --> 51:12.307
Even the craziest mathematics
is working towards a proof.

51:12.392 --> 51:15.395
Not all the mathematicians
in my family are crazy.

51:15.478 --> 51:21.817
- I wasn't using the word in a clinical way.
- I know. I know. Just for the record.

51:25.530 --> 51:27.281
How is your father?

51:27.366 --> 51:31.662
I don't know. I haven't been able
to get in touch with him for a week.

51:31.703 --> 51:33.788
He's fine.

51:33.872 --> 51:39.919
Last time I talked to him, he was fine. He's
been fine for months now. Nine months.

51:40.004 --> 51:42.047
He was a great man.

51:42.131 --> 51:43.966
He still is.

51:47.428 --> 51:49.847
You're gonna fail me, aren't you?

51:49.889 --> 51:54.393
I'm giving you another chance
to redo the problem set.

51:54.477 --> 51:58.439
You need an A.
You're quite capable of earning one.

52:00.525 --> 52:02.860
Thank you.

52:05.906 --> 52:08.116
- Professor Bhandari?
- Yeah.

52:08.200 --> 52:10.368
Don't worry about me, OK?

52:10.410 --> 52:16.499
I'm gonna write you a really nice fat set
of answers that you're really gonna like.

52:43.487 --> 52:46.156
(line ringing)

52:50.536 --> 52:54.123
(Catherine) Hi. We're not here.
Please leave a message.

52:54.206 --> 52:58.835
Claire? Hi. Listen.
When was the last time you spoke to Dad?

53:01.130 --> 53:03.298
Tuesday? Oh, God.

53:04.175 --> 53:07.136
It's fine. It's just that
I normally talk to him every day,

53:07.220 --> 53:10.431
and I haven't been able
to get ahold of him.

53:10.473 --> 53:14.310
Well, I'm glad that
you're sure everything's fine.

53:14.394 --> 53:17.647
I feel much more comfortable.
Thank you.

53:18.773 --> 53:22.818
What could have happened?
I mean, he could've had a car accident.

53:22.903 --> 53:25.322
He could've fallen and broken his hip.

53:25.405 --> 53:29.826
He could be running naked
down the Midway for all I know.

53:31.161 --> 53:34.706
Yes, Claire, I know
that you care about Dad.

53:34.790 --> 53:40.796
Yeah, as much as me. OK.
Now can I please get off the phone?

54:13.914 --> 54:15.582
Dad?

54:19.712 --> 54:21.714
Hello!

54:39.232 --> 54:40.858
Dad?

54:57.877 --> 54:59.003
Dad!

55:33.622 --> 55:35.957
Dad?

55:36.042 --> 55:38.127
Catherine, hi.
What a surprise.

55:38.878 --> 55:41.964
- What are you doing out here?
- I'm thinking.

55:42.048 --> 55:43.883
Writing.

55:43.966 --> 55:46.635
It's 30 degrees.
It's the middle of the night.

55:46.719 --> 55:49.638
- I know.
- Well, aren't you cold?

55:49.722 --> 55:53.142
Of course I am.
I'm freezing my ass off. (laughs)

55:53.226 --> 55:55.603
So what are you doing out here?

55:55.645 --> 56:01.609
It's too hot in the house. The radiators
clank and I couldn't concentrate.

56:05.989 --> 56:09.117
I've been calling and calling.
Did you not get my messages?

56:09.201 --> 56:11.495
It's a distraction.

56:11.579 --> 56:14.874
I didn't know what was going on.
I had to drive all the way out here.

56:14.957 --> 56:17.417
I can see that.

56:17.501 --> 56:21.213
- Why don't you answer the phone?
- I'm sorry, Catherine.

56:21.297 --> 56:26.051
But it's a question of priorities,
and work takes priority. You know that.

56:26.135 --> 56:28.512
- You're working?
- (Robert laughs)

56:28.596 --> 56:31.348
Goddamn it!

56:31.433 --> 56:33.768
I'm working!

56:36.480 --> 56:38.815
I mean, I say "I."

56:40.067 --> 56:42.277
Machinery.

56:42.361 --> 56:45.781
The machinery's working, Catherine.

56:45.864 --> 56:51.202
It's on full blast.
All the cylinders are firing.

56:51.287 --> 56:53.622
I'm on fire.

56:54.790 --> 56:59.461
That's why I came out here to cool off.
I haven't felt like this for years.

56:59.545 --> 57:01.296
- You're kidding.
- No.

57:01.381 --> 57:06.052
- I don't believe it.
- I don't believe it either, but it's true.

57:06.136 --> 57:08.930
It started about a week ago.
I woke up.

57:09.014 --> 57:11.933
I came downstairs,
made a cup of coffee.

57:12.017 --> 57:16.479
Before I could pour the milk in, it was like
someone turned the light on in my head.

57:16.563 --> 57:19.899
- Really?
- Not the light. The whole grid. I lit up!

57:19.983 --> 57:22.193
It's like no time has passed
since I was 21.

57:22.277 --> 57:24.904
- You're kidding me.
- No. I'm back.

57:24.989 --> 57:29.368
I'm back. In touch with the source!
The font.

57:29.410 --> 57:33.622
Whatever the source of my creativity was
all those years ago, I'm in contact with it.

57:33.706 --> 57:37.668
I'm sitting on it. It's a geyser,
and I'm shooting up in the air on top of it.

57:37.752 --> 57:40.087
God.

57:40.129 --> 57:44.591
I'm not talking about divine inspiration. It's
not funneling into my head, onto the page.

57:44.676 --> 57:48.471
I'm not saying it won't be a lot of work.
It will be, a tremendous amount of work.

57:48.555 --> 57:52.559
It's not gonna be easy.
But the raw material is there.

57:52.601 --> 57:55.228
I see places for the work to go,
new techniques.

57:55.312 --> 58:00.692
I'm gonna get whole branches
of the profession talking to each other.

58:00.776 --> 58:02.611
I'm sorry.

58:02.695 --> 58:05.072
I'm being rude.

58:05.114 --> 58:07.157
(chuckles)

58:07.241 --> 58:09.910
- How's school?
- School's fine.

58:09.952 --> 58:11.828
- You're working hard?
- Sure.

58:11.912 --> 58:13.788
- Faculty treating you all right?
- Yes.

58:13.831 --> 58:15.207
- Made any friends?
- Yes.

58:15.291 --> 58:16.375
- You dating?
- Dad.

58:16.459 --> 58:19.295
No details necessary
if you don't want to provide them.

58:19.379 --> 58:22.882
School is fine, OK?
I want to talk about what you're doing.

58:22.966 --> 58:25.218
Great. Let's talk.

58:25.301 --> 58:27.177
- This work...
- Yes.

58:27.262 --> 58:29.889
- It's here?
- Part of it, yes.

58:29.973 --> 58:32.350
- Can I see it?
- It's all at a very early stage.

58:32.434 --> 58:34.102
- I don't care.
- It's not complete.

58:34.186 --> 58:37.773
To be honest, it's all in progress.
I think we're talking years.

58:37.814 --> 58:41.401
Dad, it's OK.
Just let me see anything.

58:41.485 --> 58:43.987
- You really want to?
- Yes.

58:44.989 --> 58:48.117
- You're genuinely interested?
- Dad, of course.

58:48.159 --> 58:50.661
Of course. It is your field.

58:50.745 --> 58:52.455
Yes.

58:52.538 --> 58:54.998
You know how happy that makes me?

58:55.083 --> 58:57.335
Yes.

58:57.418 --> 59:01.839
I think there's enough here to keep me
working the rest of my life. And not just me.

59:01.923 --> 59:08.221
I was starting to imagine I was finished,
Catherine. Really finished.

59:08.305 --> 59:12.476
I was terrified I'd never work again.
Did you know that?

59:13.518 --> 59:17.480
- I wondered.
- I was absolutely bloody terrified.

59:19.191 --> 59:22.944
Then I remembered something.
I remembered you.

59:23.028 --> 59:28.283
Your creative years were just beginning.
You'd get your degree, do your own work.

59:28.367 --> 59:32.663
If you hadn't gone into math,
that would've been all right.

59:32.705 --> 59:37.167
Now, Claire's done well for herself.
I'm satisfied with her.

59:37.210 --> 59:40.129
I'm proud of you! (laughs)

59:42.215 --> 59:46.094
I know you've got your own work,
and I don't want you to neglect that.

59:46.177 --> 59:50.097
You mustn't neglect it.
But I could probably use some help.

59:50.182 --> 59:53.935
To be honest, I'd like you to help me,
to work with me, if you want to.

59:54.019 --> 59:57.814
If you can work it out with your class
schedule. I could help you with that.

59:57.898 --> 01:00:01.026
Make some calls,
talk to your teachers.

01:00:02.027 --> 01:00:05.488
I'm sorry.
I'm getting ahead of myself.

01:00:05.573 --> 01:00:08.409
Oh, Jesus, look, enough bullshit.

01:00:08.451 --> 01:00:11.412
You asked to see something.
Let's start with this.

01:00:11.496 --> 01:00:16.626
I have roughed something out.
It's a general outline for a proof.

01:00:16.709 --> 01:00:19.587
It's a major result.
It's important.

01:00:20.588 --> 01:00:25.092
It's not finished, but, uh...
you can see where it's going.

01:00:28.847 --> 01:00:31.391
Uh...

01:00:34.561 --> 01:00:36.229
Here.

01:00:48.576 --> 01:00:50.911
It's very rough.

01:00:57.627 --> 01:01:01.756
- Was there any other work in here?
- No. That's the only...

01:01:01.798 --> 01:01:04.133
Can I see it?

01:01:10.641 --> 01:01:12.184
I'm sorry. I just...

01:01:12.267 --> 01:01:17.313
So you wrote this incredible thing,
but you didn't tell anyone?

01:01:18.357 --> 01:01:21.193
I'm telling you both now.

01:01:21.986 --> 01:01:25.531
Catherine, I'm sorry,
but I just find this very hard to believe.

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:27.617
- Claire...
- This is Dad's handwriting.

01:01:27.658 --> 01:01:29.910
It's not.

01:01:29.994 --> 01:01:32.830
- It looks exactly like it.
- That is my writing.

01:01:32.872 --> 01:01:35.166
I'm sorry.

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:38.294
Well, ask Hal. He's been
looking at Dad's writing all week.

01:01:38.378 --> 01:01:41.839
- Well, I don't know.
- (Catherine) Hal, come on.

01:01:44.718 --> 01:01:48.972
- I'm not a handwriting expert.
- Well, whose writing does it look like?

01:01:49.056 --> 01:01:52.351
It looks... I don't know
what Catherine's handwriting looks like.

01:01:52.434 --> 01:01:54.644
It looks like that.

01:01:54.687 --> 01:01:56.105
OK.

01:01:56.188 --> 01:01:58.482
You know what I think?
I think it's early,

01:01:58.566 --> 01:02:02.987
and everybody's tired and not in
the best state to make emotional decisions.

01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:07.283
- So let's just all take a breath.
- You don't believe me.

01:02:07.366 --> 01:02:09.952
Well, I really don't know
anything about this.

01:02:10.036 --> 01:02:11.829
Never mind.

01:02:12.956 --> 01:02:17.502
I don't know why I expected you
to believe me about anything.

01:02:18.378 --> 01:02:22.090
Could you tell us the proof?
And then that would show that it was yours.

01:02:22.174 --> 01:02:24.217
You wouldn't understand it.

01:02:24.301 --> 01:02:27.429
Well, tell it to Hal.

01:02:27.512 --> 01:02:31.724
I mean, I could. We could sit down
and talk it through. It might take a while.

01:02:31.809 --> 01:02:35.729
- You can't use the book.
- For God's sake, it's 40 pages long.

01:02:35.813 --> 01:02:39.942
I didn't memorize it.
It's not a muffin recipe.

01:02:40.025 --> 01:02:43.153
Oh, Jesus, this is stupid.

01:02:43.237 --> 01:02:45.113
- Hal, tell her.
- Tell her what?

01:02:45.198 --> 01:02:48.534
- Whose book is that?
- I don't know.

01:02:50.119 --> 01:02:52.413
What is the matter with you?

01:02:53.206 --> 01:02:56.793
You've been...
You've been going through this other stuff.

01:02:56.876 --> 01:02:59.920
You know there's nothing
even remotely like that up here.

01:03:00.005 --> 01:03:02.340
- Catherine...
- OK. OK.

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:06.678
OK, we'll sit down
and I'll talk you through the proof.

01:03:06.762 --> 01:03:08.805
OK? OK?

01:03:08.889 --> 01:03:11.349
If Claire will please
let me have my book back.

01:03:11.433 --> 01:03:14.311
All right. OK, talk him through it.

01:03:14.395 --> 01:03:17.481
- It still wouldn't prove that she wrote it.
- Why not?

01:03:17.565 --> 01:03:20.818
Your dad may have written it
and explained it to you later.

01:03:20.901 --> 01:03:23.695
I'm not saying he did.
I'm saying there's no proof that...

01:03:23.779 --> 01:03:29.576
Of course there isn't. But come on!
He didn't write it. He couldn't have.

01:03:29.661 --> 01:03:32.121
Even in the year he was well,
he couldn't work.

01:03:32.163 --> 01:03:34.915
You know that.
You're supposed to be a scientist.

01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:38.503
Here's my suggestion. I know
three or four guys at the department,

01:03:38.587 --> 01:03:41.339
sharp, disinterested people,
who knew your dad's work.

01:03:41.423 --> 01:03:43.049
- I'll take this to them.
- What?

01:03:43.133 --> 01:03:46.428
I'll tell them that
we found something potentially major.

01:03:46.511 --> 01:03:49.097
We're not sure of the authorship.
I'll sit with them.

01:03:49.139 --> 01:03:52.267
We'll talk through it,
and we'll figure out what we've got.

01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:56.021
It might take a couple days,
but then we'd have a lot more information.

01:03:56.105 --> 01:03:58.732
I think that's an excellent suggestion.

01:03:58.816 --> 01:04:00.400
- You can't.
- Catherine.

01:04:00.484 --> 01:04:02.360
- You can't take it.
- I am not taking it.

01:04:02.445 --> 01:04:05.990
- This is exactly what you wanted.
- Oh, come on. Jesus...

01:04:06.074 --> 01:04:09.243
You don't waste any time, do you?
It's no hesitation.

01:04:09.327 --> 01:04:12.413
You can't wait to show them
your brilliant discovery.

01:04:12.497 --> 01:04:16.125
- I am trying to determine what this is.
- I'm telling you what it is.

01:04:16.167 --> 01:04:17.543
- You don't know!
- I wrote it!

01:04:17.627 --> 01:04:19.962
It is your father's handwriting!

01:04:23.675 --> 01:04:27.136
At least, it looks an awful lot
like the writing in the other books.

01:04:27.221 --> 01:04:31.016
Maybe your writing looks exactly like his.
I don't know.

01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:34.937
It does look like his.

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:38.607
I mean, it's one of his notebooks,
the exact same kind he used.

01:04:38.691 --> 01:04:42.194
I told you.
He gave it to me.

01:04:45.698 --> 01:04:48.158
I didn't show this to anyone.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:56.042
I wanted you to be the first to see it.
I didn't know I wanted that until last night.

01:04:57.210 --> 01:04:59.962
- I trusted you.
- I know.

01:05:00.047 --> 01:05:02.382
- Was I wrong?
- No.

01:05:02.466 --> 01:05:06.011
I should've known that she
wouldn't believe me, but why don't you?

01:05:06.053 --> 01:05:09.514
I know how hard it would be
to come up with something like this.

01:05:09.556 --> 01:05:12.392
You'd have to be your dad
at the peak of his powers.

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:15.604
Just because you
and the rest of the geeks worshipped him

01:05:15.688 --> 01:05:17.356
does not mean he wrote the proof.

01:05:17.398 --> 01:05:21.277
He was the best. My generation
hasn't produced anything like him.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:24.238
He revolutionized the field
twice before he was 22.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.575
I am sorry. You took some classes
at Northwestern for a few months.

01:05:27.659 --> 01:05:31.871
- My education wasn't at Northwestern!
- Even so, it doesn't matter.

01:05:31.955 --> 01:05:36.543
It's too advanced.
I don't even understand most of it.

01:05:36.626 --> 01:05:39.587
- You think it's too advanced?
- Yes.

01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:42.006
It's too advanced for you.

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:45.301
You could not have done this work.

01:05:46.095 --> 01:05:48.681
- But what if I did?
- Well, what if?

01:05:49.431 --> 01:05:52.475
It would be a real disaster for you.

01:05:53.352 --> 01:05:55.312
Wouldn't it?

01:05:55.396 --> 01:05:59.066
You and the other geeks
who barely finished your PhD's,

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:02.153
who are marking time
doing lame research,

01:06:02.236 --> 01:06:04.947
bragging about
the conferences they go to.

01:06:05.031 --> 01:06:06.991
Wow.

01:06:07.075 --> 01:06:12.664
Playing in an awful band and whining
that they're intellectually past it at 26,

01:06:12.747 --> 01:06:15.625
because they are!

01:06:29.139 --> 01:06:30.432
Catherine.

01:06:30.599 --> 01:06:32.058
Catherine.

01:06:32.143 --> 01:06:33.269
Oh!

01:06:41.361 --> 01:06:43.738
When are you going to do
some mathematics with me?

01:06:43.821 --> 01:06:46.949
I can't think of anything worse.
You want some Parmesan?

01:06:46.991 --> 01:06:50.452
I'm all alone. I have important things
to say, and you're not helping.

01:06:50.537 --> 01:06:53.456
- You used to love it.
- Not anymore.

01:06:53.498 --> 01:06:56.042
You knew prime numbers
before you could read.

01:06:56.126 --> 01:07:00.588
- Well, now I've forgotten.
- Don't be lazy, Catherine!

01:07:02.466 --> 01:07:06.386
I haven't been lazy.
I've been taking care of you.

01:07:07.429 --> 01:07:10.307
You dropped out of school.
You sleep till noon.

01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:13.143
You eat junk. You don't work.
Dishes pile up in the sink.

01:07:13.185 --> 01:07:16.897
- Some days you don't even get out of bed.
- Those are the good days.

01:07:16.981 --> 01:07:21.152
They're fever days and you sweated them
away. You'll never know what work you lost

01:07:21.235 --> 01:07:24.863
because you were moping, moping
in your unmade bad. Always moping.

01:07:24.948 --> 01:07:27.867
Up until four in the afternoon sometimes,
Catherine.

01:07:27.909 --> 01:07:31.496
I have you on my clock.
You know I'm right.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:36.585
You know, I'm told by some very important
people. You know I know.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.507
- I've lost a few days.
- How many?

01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:44.926
- I don't know.
- I bet you do. I bet you count.

01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:48.221
- Knock it off.
- How many days have you lost?

01:07:48.305 --> 01:07:51.183
- A month. Around a month.
- Exactly.

01:07:51.225 --> 01:07:54.269
- Dad, eat your dinner.
- How many?

01:07:54.353 --> 01:07:57.814
- 33 days.
- Be precise, for Christ's sake.

01:07:57.899 --> 01:08:00.234
I slept till noon today.

01:08:07.242 --> 01:08:10.036
Make it 33 and a quarter days.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.372
Yeah, all right.

01:08:12.414 --> 01:08:14.499
- You're kidding.
- No.

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:17.502
- Amazing number.
- It's a depressing fucking number.

01:08:17.586 --> 01:08:21.965
If every day you lost were a year, it would
be a very interesting fucking number.

01:08:22.049 --> 01:08:26.386
- 33 and a quarter years is not interesting.
- Stop it. You know exactly what I mean.

01:08:26.428 --> 01:08:29.889
- 1729 weeks.
- 1729. Great number.

01:08:29.932 --> 01:08:34.103
The smallest number expressible as the
sum of two cubes in two different ways.

01:08:34.187 --> 01:08:37.189
12 cubed plus 1 cubed equals 1729.

01:08:37.273 --> 01:08:41.402
And 10 cubed plus 9 cubed...
Yes, we've got it. Thank you.

01:08:41.444 --> 01:08:43.696
You see?

01:08:43.779 --> 01:08:46.948
Even your depression
is mathematical.

01:08:47.033 --> 01:08:49.035
Stop moping.

01:08:51.203 --> 01:08:53.581
Do some work.

01:09:01.631 --> 01:09:03.926
Take a look.

01:09:20.318 --> 01:09:22.194
(knocking)

01:09:23.154 --> 01:09:25.029
(Claire) Catherine?

01:09:28.326 --> 01:09:30.411
Katie, honey?

01:09:43.634 --> 01:09:46.261
Catherine.

01:10:03.154 --> 01:10:06.782
I figured out how to get
a lower bound for L.

01:10:08.785 --> 01:10:11.496
Modification of Landau-Siegel.

01:10:12.831 --> 01:10:15.291
What if this L had a Siegel zero?

01:10:17.503 --> 01:10:20.172
You'd need an effective version.

01:10:25.219 --> 01:10:26.386
Shit.

01:12:07.409 --> 01:12:08.410
Catherine.

01:12:12.956 --> 01:12:14.916
Catherine!

01:13:38.838 --> 01:13:41.257
Catherine!

01:13:41.299 --> 01:13:43.384
- What?
- Aah! Jesus!

01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:49.140
God, you scared me.
What are you doing there?

01:13:49.223 --> 01:13:53.185
Sorry. I just...
I wanted to...

01:13:53.269 --> 01:13:56.230
It's wonderful news.

01:13:56.314 --> 01:13:58.316
I think I've got it.

01:14:03.447 --> 01:14:05.240
Catherine!

01:14:05.324 --> 01:14:06.575
Katie.

01:14:06.658 --> 01:14:09.786
- Katie, what is it?
- It's not mine. It's not mine!

01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:13.248
- It's not mine. It's his. It's not mine.
- What, honey?

01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:17.794
- It's not mine. It's not mine.
- What, honey? What's the matter?

01:14:18.796 --> 01:14:21.590
I stole it from him.
I stole it. It's not mine.

01:14:21.632 --> 01:14:25.135
- What do you mean, you stole it?
- It's not mine.

01:14:25.219 --> 01:14:26.261
OK.

01:14:26.346 --> 01:14:29.390
- I killed him. I killed him.
- No, honey. No.

01:14:29.474 --> 01:14:32.769
I never should have written it.
I never should have written it.

01:14:32.852 --> 01:14:37.189
- OK. You're OK.
- I never should have written it.

01:14:37.274 --> 01:14:40.735
Is it...?
Is it possible, honey, that...?

01:14:42.404 --> 01:14:46.116
Is it possible that you
just wanted to so badly

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:53.290
and you... you deserved to do something
special like this thing, this proof?

01:14:53.332 --> 01:14:57.794
Is it possible
that you just imagined that you wrote it?

01:14:58.838 --> 01:15:00.131
Hmm?

01:15:00.172 --> 01:15:04.926
Is it possible
that it really was Dad's after all?

01:15:05.928 --> 01:15:07.846
Hmm?

01:15:07.889 --> 01:15:10.224
Is that possible?

01:15:13.561 --> 01:15:16.647
You didn't kill him, sweetheart.

01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:19.192
He just died, that's all.

01:15:21.528 --> 01:15:23.822
He just died.

01:15:26.867 --> 01:15:29.661
(Catherine) Hi. We're not here.
Please leave a message.

01:15:29.745 --> 01:15:31.204
(beep)

01:15:31.288 --> 01:15:34.541
(Hal) Catherine. It's me again.
I really need to speak to you.

01:15:34.625 --> 01:15:37.127
So please call me back.

01:16:00.527 --> 01:16:02.904
Can I take these for you?

01:16:05.282 --> 01:16:06.992
Claire!

01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:12.289
- I thought you'd left.
- I had to delay my flight.

01:16:13.708 --> 01:16:16.544
Where's Catherine?
I need to talk to her.

01:16:16.586 --> 01:16:18.629
- She's inside.
- This thing...

01:16:19.881 --> 01:16:21.424
checks out.

01:16:21.507 --> 01:16:25.010
I've been over it with two sets of guys,
old geeks and young geeks.

01:16:25.094 --> 01:16:26.720
It's weird.

01:16:26.763 --> 01:16:30.224
I don't know where the techniques
come from, it is very hard to follow,

01:16:30.266 --> 01:16:32.810
but we can't find anything wrong with it.

01:16:32.894 --> 01:16:36.564
I mean, there may be something
wrong with it, but we can't find it.

01:16:36.648 --> 01:16:38.900
I have not slept.

01:16:39.943 --> 01:16:43.071
It's real.

01:16:43.155 --> 01:16:44.114
Thank you.

01:16:44.156 --> 01:16:46.742
See, I had to swear these guys to secrecy.

01:16:46.784 --> 01:16:48.869
They were jumping out of their skins.

01:16:48.953 --> 01:16:51.080
One email, it's all over.

01:16:51.122 --> 01:16:53.624
I threatened them.
Yeah, I think we're safe.

01:16:53.708 --> 01:16:56.043
They're physical cowards.

01:16:57.128 --> 01:17:00.756
- Where's Catherine?
- This is not a good time.

01:17:02.175 --> 01:17:04.594
You're leaving?

01:17:04.636 --> 01:17:07.889
- The flight is at noon.
- You're taking her away?

01:17:07.972 --> 01:17:09.598
Yes.

01:17:09.641 --> 01:17:11.267
- To New York?
- Yes.

01:17:11.351 --> 01:17:14.520
- You're just gonna drag her away?
- She's entirely happy to come.

01:17:14.604 --> 01:17:18.566
- I'd like to speak to Catherine.
- She doesn't want to see you.

01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:20.652
Does she have any say
in whether she goes?

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:23.280
She's been completely out of it, Hal.

01:17:23.322 --> 01:17:25.949
Five days she wasn't speaking.

01:17:30.121 --> 01:17:33.249
Do you want your coat, sweetie?
It's cold.

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:37.962
I'll get your things. The movers
will get anything we've forgotten.

01:17:38.045 --> 01:17:40.380
Are you all right?

01:17:51.726 --> 01:17:54.353
It works.

01:17:54.438 --> 01:17:57.024
I thought you might wanna know.

01:17:59.359 --> 01:18:01.653
- I had to see you.
- I'm leaving.

01:18:01.737 --> 01:18:06.325
- Just wait a minute.
- What? What do you want?

01:18:06.367 --> 01:18:09.078
You have the book.
She told me that she gave it to you,

01:18:09.161 --> 01:18:12.622
so do whatever you want with it.

01:18:13.082 --> 01:18:16.043
Publish. Go for it.
Have a press conference.

01:18:16.127 --> 01:18:19.005
Tell the world
what my father discovered.

01:18:19.047 --> 01:18:21.841
I don't think your father wrote it.

01:18:23.968 --> 01:18:28.013
- You thought so last week.
- That was last week.

01:18:28.098 --> 01:18:31.476
I spent this week reading the proof.
I think I understand it.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:34.396
It uses a lot of newer
mathematical techniques,

01:18:34.479 --> 01:18:37.148
things that were developed
in the '80s and '90s.

01:18:37.232 --> 01:18:39.567
Noncommutative geometry,
random matrices.

01:18:39.651 --> 01:18:43.571
I think I learned more mathematics this
week than in three years of grad school.

01:18:43.656 --> 01:18:45.950
- So?
- So the proof is very...

01:18:46.992 --> 01:18:49.619
- hip.
- Get some sleep, Hal.

01:18:49.704 --> 01:18:53.541
- What was your father doing for 20 years?
- Are you done?

01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:56.335
He wouldn't have been able to master
those new techniques.

01:18:56.419 --> 01:18:58.713
- He was a genius.
- But he was nuts.

01:18:58.796 --> 01:19:01.256
- So he read about them later.
- Maybe.

01:19:01.299 --> 01:19:04.969
The books he would've needed
are upstairs in your room, some of them.

01:19:05.053 --> 01:19:08.973
He dated everything. Even his
most incoherent entries, he dated.

01:19:09.057 --> 01:19:11.309
- There are no dates in this.
- The handwriting.

01:19:11.393 --> 01:19:13.770
Parents and children can
have similar handwriting,

01:19:13.854 --> 01:19:17.482
especially if they've spent
a lot of time together.

01:19:19.276 --> 01:19:21.528
Interesting theory.

01:19:21.612 --> 01:19:23.572
I like it.

01:19:23.656 --> 01:19:26.534
I like it, too.

01:19:26.617 --> 01:19:29.703
It's what I told you last week.

01:19:31.497 --> 01:19:34.166
I know.

01:19:35.001 --> 01:19:37.837
- You blew it.
- This is yours, Catherine.

01:19:37.921 --> 01:19:41.883
It's too bad, too,
'cause the rest of it was really good.

01:19:42.884 --> 01:19:47.889
"I loved your dad." "I always liked you."
"I wanna spend every minute with you."

01:19:47.973 --> 01:19:50.267
That's killer stuff.

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:52.477
I meant it.

01:19:52.561 --> 01:19:55.397
You got laid and you got the notebook.
You're a genius.

01:19:55.481 --> 01:19:58.233
Talk to me, Catherine.

01:19:58.317 --> 01:20:00.611
- This proof is yours.
- Forget it.

01:20:00.653 --> 01:20:03.906
You'll have to deal with it eventually.
You can't just ignore it.

01:20:03.989 --> 01:20:06.408
- You'll have to publish.
- Leave me alone, Hal.

01:20:06.492 --> 01:20:08.243
- Take it at least.
- I don't want it.

01:20:08.327 --> 01:20:11.330
- Come on. I am trying to correct things.
- You can't!

01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:14.792
Do you hear me?

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:18.045
You think you've figured something out?

01:20:18.129 --> 01:20:22.383
You run over here all pleased with yourself
because you changed your mind?

01:20:22.467 --> 01:20:26.262
Now you're certain?
Hal, you don't know anything.

01:20:26.346 --> 01:20:30.141
The book, the math,
the dates, the writing,

01:20:30.183 --> 01:20:33.728
all that stuff you just decided
with your buddies, it's just evidence.

01:20:33.812 --> 01:20:36.523
- It doesn't prove anything.
- OK, what would?

01:20:36.607 --> 01:20:39.401
Nothing.

01:20:42.279 --> 01:20:45.115
You should've trusted me.

01:20:46.283 --> 01:20:47.742
I...

01:20:47.827 --> 01:20:50.162
I know.

01:20:56.961 --> 01:20:59.338
Claire sold the house?

01:21:02.342 --> 01:21:05.803
She wants me in New York.
She wants to look after me.

01:21:05.887 --> 01:21:11.059
What? Do you need looking after?
You looked after your father for five years.

01:21:11.143 --> 01:21:15.480
- So maybe it's my turn.
- There is nothing wrong with you.

01:21:15.564 --> 01:21:18.650
We should be on our way, honey.

01:21:18.734 --> 01:21:20.277
You can't just walk away,

01:21:20.361 --> 01:21:24.240
pretend like it never happened and then
get a job at Urban Outfitters or something.

01:21:24.323 --> 01:21:28.118
- Just take it.
- Katie, honey, let's go.

01:21:29.078 --> 01:21:31.330
Stay in Chicago.
You're an adult.

01:21:31.414 --> 01:21:32.665
I gotta go.

01:21:32.749 --> 01:21:34.834
- Please.
- No.

01:21:34.918 --> 01:21:38.004
- Catherine, this isn't about me.
- (Claire) Katie, come on.

01:21:38.088 --> 01:21:41.591
Don't you owe this to yourself at least?

01:21:41.675 --> 01:21:44.010
Goodbye, Hal.

01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:00.986
Catherine!

01:22:03.322 --> 01:22:05.324
Catherine!

01:22:42.989 --> 01:22:46.117
- Hi. And where are you going today?
- To New York City.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.285
Can I see some photo ID, please?

01:23:06.471 --> 01:23:07.513
(sighs)

01:23:15.147 --> 01:23:18.066
Wow. You sure got a lot done.

01:23:18.150 --> 01:23:21.069
Well, I had five extra days.

01:23:24.198 --> 01:23:27.076
I need some more coffee.
Do you want some?

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.412
Am I on that list?

01:23:29.495 --> 01:23:30.954
What?

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:33.708
"Square away crazy sister."

01:23:33.792 --> 01:23:35.502
Check.

01:23:37.212 --> 01:23:39.923
That's not fair, Katie.

01:23:40.006 --> 01:23:42.592
I just wanna take care of you.

01:23:55.564 --> 01:23:57.941
(Robert) Catherine!

01:23:59.235 --> 01:24:01.195
- What?
- Aah! Jesus!

01:24:03.281 --> 01:24:06.951
God, you scared me.
What are you doing there?

01:24:07.035 --> 01:24:10.997
Sorry. I just...
I wanted to...

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.248
It's wonderful news.

01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:16.544
I think I've got it.

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:27.430
What do you think?

01:24:47.535 --> 01:24:50.454
- Wow, Dad.
- Can you believe it?

01:24:52.248 --> 01:24:54.542
I knew you had it in you.

01:24:54.626 --> 01:24:56.878
That's a pretty
mealy-mouthed response.

01:24:56.962 --> 01:25:00.715
What about it? What do you think?
Let's talk it through.

01:25:00.799 --> 01:25:02.550
Not tonight. I'm tired.

01:25:02.634 --> 01:25:05.762
Come on. This is the beginning
of our real work together.

01:25:05.804 --> 01:25:08.973
You think I've stolen the thunder
because I broke through first?

01:25:09.058 --> 01:25:11.435
This is only the beginning.

01:25:11.477 --> 01:25:14.897
- I think we should call it a night.
- Read out the first couple of lines.

01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:19.442
We go line by line out loud,
see if there's a better way, a shorter way.

01:25:19.527 --> 01:25:21.821
No. Come on. Tomorrow.

01:25:22.697 --> 01:25:25.533
I've waited years for this, goddamn it.

01:25:25.617 --> 01:25:29.579
- Let's do some work together.
- Dad, I think we should get some sleep.

01:25:29.662 --> 01:25:32.748
- Not until we talk about the proof!
- I don't want to talk about it.

01:25:32.832 --> 01:25:37.044
Goddammit, open the goddamn book!
Read me the lines!

01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:05.158
"Let X equal the quantity
of all quantities of X.

01:26:05.241 --> 01:26:08.619
"Let X equal the cold.

01:26:10.372 --> 01:26:12.874
"It is cold in December.

01:26:12.958 --> 01:26:18.338
"The months of cold
equal November through February.

01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:22.217
"There are four months
of cold and four of heat,

01:26:22.301 --> 01:26:26.597
"leaving four months
of indeterminate temperature.

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:29.724
"In February. It snows.

01:26:29.808 --> 01:26:34.604
"In March. The lake is a lake of ice.

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:37.358
"In September.
The students come back

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:40.403
"and the bookstores are full.

01:26:40.486 --> 01:26:44.740
"Let X equal the month
of full bookstores.

01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:48.870
"The number of books
approaches infinity

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:52.916
"as the number of months of cold
approaches four.

01:26:56.294 --> 01:27:01.132
"I will never be as cold now
as I will in the future.

01:27:01.967 --> 01:27:05.136
"The future of cold is infinite.

01:27:08.015 --> 01:27:12.227
"The future of heat
is the future of cold.

01:27:15.690 --> 01:27:18.901
"The bookstores are infinite

01:27:18.943 --> 01:27:22.571
"and so are never full
except in September."

01:27:43.093 --> 01:27:45.011
I'm exhausted.

01:28:59.047 --> 01:29:03.176
I can't wait to get back
to the coffee at home.

01:29:03.218 --> 01:29:06.387
We have a place where we buy coffee.
They roast it themselves.

01:29:06.472 --> 01:29:11.101
They have an old roaster down in the
basement. You can smell it on the street.

01:29:11.185 --> 01:29:16.649
Some mornings you can smell it from
our place, four stories up. It's wonderful.

01:29:16.733 --> 01:29:21.321
"Manhattan's Best."
Some magazine wrote it up.

01:29:21.404 --> 01:29:23.614
I mean, who knows?

01:29:23.698 --> 01:29:26.075
But it's very good.

01:29:26.159 --> 01:29:28.119
I think...

01:29:28.203 --> 01:29:34.042
I'm actually gonna give up coffee
'cause it's bad for my nerves.

01:29:34.084 --> 01:29:35.960
Catherine.

01:29:36.712 --> 01:29:38.922
Catherine!

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:02.738
(Catherine) How many days have I lost?

01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:10.914
How can I get back
to the place where I started?

01:30:15.419 --> 01:30:21.633
I'm outside a house.
Trying to find my way in.

01:30:21.717 --> 01:30:26.096
But it is locked and the blinds are down.

01:30:26.138 --> 01:30:28.765
And I've lost the key.

01:30:28.849 --> 01:30:34.605
And I can't remember what the rooms
look like or where I put anything.

01:30:38.776 --> 01:30:42.196
And if I dare go in inside. I wonder...

01:30:44.699 --> 01:30:47.785
will I ever be able to find my way out?

01:31:26.034 --> 01:31:29.996
Sometimes in my head I think it works,
and then...

01:31:31.456 --> 01:31:35.877
Sometimes I just think it's...
crazy.

01:31:37.379 --> 01:31:40.006
There's nothing wrong with you.

01:31:42.843 --> 01:31:45.679
I think I'm like my dad.

01:31:47.181 --> 01:31:49.516
I think you are, too.

01:31:53.605 --> 01:31:56.149
I'm afraid I'm like my dad.

01:31:57.108 --> 01:32:01.153
- You are not him.
- Maybe I will be.

01:32:01.238 --> 01:32:03.740
Maybe, and maybe you'll be better.

01:32:09.329 --> 01:32:11.414
It was like...

01:32:13.333 --> 01:32:15.335
connecting the dots.

01:32:17.796 --> 01:32:21.257
Some nights I could connect
three or four of them,

01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:25.053
and some nights
they'd be really far apart.

01:32:25.137 --> 01:32:30.434
I'd have no idea how to get to the next one,
if there was the next one.

01:32:33.354 --> 01:32:36.065
It just seems
really stitched together and lumpy.

01:32:36.107 --> 01:32:38.776
Dad's stuff was way more elegant.

01:32:40.111 --> 01:32:44.573
Talk me through it
and tell me what's bothering you.

01:32:44.658 --> 01:32:48.411
You got a bit of ground to make up, Dobbs.

01:32:48.453 --> 01:32:51.164
You know that?

01:32:56.921 --> 01:33:00.007
And there's no way
to prove that I wrote it.

01:33:02.468 --> 01:33:04.762
No. But we could sit down,

01:33:04.846 --> 01:33:09.434
we could talk it through and
determine if you couldn't have.

01:33:39.465 --> 01:33:44.136
(Catherine) If I go back to the beginning.
I could start it over again.

01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:45.804
Here.

01:33:46.848 --> 01:33:49.350
(Catherine) I could go line by line.

01:33:50.351 --> 01:33:52.853
Try and find a shorter way.

01:33:52.896 --> 01:33:54.272
There are a lot of...

01:33:54.355 --> 01:33:56.649
I could try to make it...

01:33:57.692 --> 01:33:59.819
better.
