- They will not take this temple.

06:29.023 --> 06:30.357
I picked up a straggler.

06:30.391 --> 06:33.060
Stryker, Kung Lao.
Kung Lao, Stryker.

06:33.094 --> 06:34.661
Did that thing have wings?

06:34.694 --> 06:36.663
Did I shoot
something with wings?

06:36.696 --> 06:38.631
What the hell is going on?

06:38.665 --> 06:40.267
He's new. Where are they?

06:40.301 --> 06:42.002
Where do you think?

06:42.036 --> 06:43.204
[Jax] Shit.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.042
[ominous music playing]

06:51.846 --> 06:52.913
General.

06:52.947 --> 06:53.914
[General] What is it?

06:54.782 --> 06:56.383
Spit it out!

06:56.417 --> 06:58.786
We've broken the temple gates,
but...

06:58.819 --> 07:00.988
We're experiencing
heavy losses...

07:01.021 --> 07:02.389
We will mourn our dead later.

07:02.423 --> 07:05.192
Reiko, Kintaro,
move to the front.

07:05.226 --> 07:06.894
Push in from the opening.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.964
Jade, Baraka, take the TaiGore
through the sides.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.799
Leave no one alive!

07:11.832 --> 07:14.335
[Johnny] Wow. That...
That seems a bit harsh.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.337
There! In the trees.

07:16.370 --> 07:17.705
Finally.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.173
Yeah, I've been
up here forever,

07:19.206 --> 07:21.208
it's about time you saw me.

07:21.242 --> 07:22.409
[grunts] Oh, my back.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.378
Shit!

07:24.411 --> 07:26.413
- [all snarling]
- Whoa.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.749
Whoa! Okay.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.185
What do you want?

07:31.218 --> 07:33.187
I've come to negotiate
a surrender.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.422
[laughs sarcastically]

07:35.456 --> 07:38.359
The tiny humans
wish to surrender?

07:38.392 --> 07:41.428
Tell him "no,"
so that we may crush them!

07:43.063 --> 07:44.732
What are your terms?

07:44.765 --> 07:47.968
See? A lady with smarts.
No wonder you're in charge.

07:48.002 --> 07:49.436
Plus, that leotard suits you.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.905
A little airy
for my tastes, but...

07:50.938 --> 07:52.273
Nevermind. Kill him!

07:52.306 --> 07:54.308
Wait! Sorry. I get distracted.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.210
A few too many energy drinks.

07:56.243 --> 07:59.747
Okay. So, pull everyone back.
Drop your weapons. And then...

07:59.780 --> 08:02.283
We'll make sure you guys
make it out of this alive.

08:05.019 --> 08:07.288
Uh, you're confused. I get it.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.323
I usually leave this sort
of thing up to my agent,

08:09.356 --> 08:12.226
but I fired him after he sent
me to that weirdo death island.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.162
Now he's getting
ten percent of nothing. Right?

08:15.196 --> 08:17.464
You wish...
for us to surrender?

08:17.498 --> 08:20.467
Well, yeah. I mean...
Come on, you guys.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.970
That's what... One, two,
three, four, five.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.505
[murmurs] ...Carry the four.

08:24.538 --> 08:28.275
A couple of thousand of you
versus... me. Johnny Cage.

08:28.309 --> 08:31.745
International action star.
It's hardly fair.

08:31.779 --> 08:34.847
Kitana, he is obviously
mentally unwell.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.951
Let me kill him
and be done with it.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.852
I have a counterproposal.

08:38.885 --> 08:42.756
Kneel. Kneel and pledge
allegiance to Shao Kahn.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.191
Pledge allegiance?

08:44.225 --> 08:46.794
Lady, I don't pledge allegiance
to anything

08:46.827 --> 08:49.096
except the red, white,
and blue.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.864
Then you shall die.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.199
[growls]

08:53.000 --> 08:54.401
[snarling]

08:54.435 --> 08:55.903
Let's do this!

08:55.936 --> 08:58.305
[dramatically] Wah... Yah!
Bruce Lee!

08:59.406 --> 09:00.374
[Johnny] Ooh.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.243
Yeah.

09:02.276 --> 09:04.144
I forgot.
I brought my girlfriend,

09:04.178 --> 09:06.247
and... [sighs] whoa,
let me tell you,

09:06.280 --> 09:08.215
she is pretty good
with a rifle.

09:08.249 --> 09:10.351
So? You guys gonna surrender,
or what?

09:12.119 --> 09:13.087

[grunts] Yah!

09:30.304 --> 09:31.338
[roars]

09:31.372 --> 09:33.374
Whoa! Didn't I kill you?

09:33.407 --> 09:34.508
[both grunting]

09:37.444 --> 09:39.280
[effort grunt]

09:41.348 --> 09:43.083
Whoa! A little help here!

09:43.117 --> 09:45.452
- [grunts]
- Nah. A lotta help. Now!

09:46.320 --> 09:47.588
Huh?

09:47.621 --> 09:49.256
- [effort grunt]
- [groans]

09:51.025 --> 09:52.026
[grunts]

09:53.460 --> 09:55.396
- [groans]
- I'm not your girlfriend.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.298
- Well, not yet
- Ugh.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.133
[Kitana] Give up now.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.934
The two of you
can't hope to defeat

10:00.968 --> 10:02.369
Shao Kahn's army.

10:02.403 --> 10:05.172
Two? Who said anything
about two?

10:05.205 --> 10:07.408
- Did you say two?
- Nope.

10:07.441 --> 10:08.542
Well, I didn't say two.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.044
If it was just two of us,

10:10.077 --> 10:11.845
well, I mean,
that would be stupid.

10:11.879 --> 10:12.880
Crazy even!

10:12.913 --> 10:13.947
[whooshing in distance]

10:22.356 --> 10:25.326
Lord Raiden... The chosen one!

10:25.359 --> 10:27.161
Oh, great.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.063
Now I'm getting second billing.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.998
- Shall we?
- We shall.

10:32.933 --> 10:33.967
[grunting]

10:36.003 --> 10:37.438
Still on the wrong side?

10:37.471 --> 10:39.640
[grunts] I don't have
much of a choice.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.241
And if you did?

10:42.242 --> 10:43.143

[grunting]

11:36.997 --> 11:38.298
Ahhh!

11:38.332 --> 11:39.500
Impudent.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.136
[panting]

11:45.038 --> 11:46.473
Stand back, Liu Kang.

11:46.507 --> 11:48.375
I have this, Lord Raiden.

11:48.409 --> 11:50.611
Stand back!

11:50.644 --> 11:53.280
Wise to listen to your Master.

11:53.313 --> 11:56.950
Besides,
I didn't come to fight.

11:56.984 --> 11:59.186
Of course. No.
You didn't come to fight.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.189
I mean, these soldiers are
probably some sort of flash mob.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.424
What are they going to sing?

12:03.457 --> 12:04.658
"Thriller?"
That would be great.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.560
Johnny Cage!

12:06.593 --> 12:10.230
I could continue
to destroy your realm.

12:10.264 --> 12:14.067
I have untold legions
that will die for my cause.

12:14.101 --> 12:18.105
But... I offer an end
to the bloodshed.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.373
Permanently.

12:21.108 --> 12:24.311
You and I will travel
to the Elder Gods,

12:24.344 --> 12:26.680
petition them for
another tournament.

12:26.714 --> 12:29.650
The final Mortal Kombat.

12:30.484 --> 12:31.753
Listen, shithead.

12:31.786 --> 12:34.288
If you think
Raiden's going to agree

12:34.321 --> 12:36.490
to another tournament
after we just kicked your ass

12:36.523 --> 12:38.225
on that whacked out
island of yours,

12:38.258 --> 12:40.260
you're an even bigger idiot
than I thought.

12:40.294 --> 12:41.729
We've got another
1,000 years

12:41.763 --> 12:43.163
before that has to
happen again...

12:43.197 --> 12:44.264
Agreed.

12:45.666 --> 12:47.201
I'm sorry.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.502
Uh, maybe it's being kicked
in the head

12:48.535 --> 12:50.070
by assholes
from another dimension,

12:50.103 --> 12:52.573
but I thought
you said "agreed."

12:52.606 --> 12:53.775
I did.

12:53.808 --> 12:55.710
You can't be serious.

12:55.743 --> 12:58.078
We're holding them off
on various fronts.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.680
We can win this!

12:59.714 --> 13:01.148
And then?

13:03.785 --> 13:06.721
We may win for a time.

13:06.754 --> 13:10.290
But Outworld is a place
of vast resources.

13:10.324 --> 13:12.426
He will return to his throne,

13:12.459 --> 13:15.596
rebuild his army and
attack again.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.298
Why place the responsibility
of survival

13:18.332 --> 13:20.300
on your children's children

13:20.334 --> 13:23.303
when we can do
something about it now?

13:23.337 --> 13:25.372
We should discuss this.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.542
No. I have made my decision.

13:28.575 --> 13:32.479
If we have a chance
to end this now, we must.

13:32.513 --> 13:33.514
It's not fair.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.115
It rarely is.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.316
But such is life.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.319
I accept your offer.

13:39.353 --> 13:41.588
Then we shall go
to the Elder Gods

13:41.622 --> 13:44.024
and petition them together.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.027
- Be careful.
- And you.

13:47.561 --> 13:48.495
All of you.

15:03.771 --> 15:05.572
[Shinnok] Ahhh. Good.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.709
You've arrived.

15:07.742 --> 15:11.445
Now... We can begin.

15:11.478 --> 15:14.849
The island... Quan Chi.

15:14.882 --> 15:16.851
He was a fine servant.

15:16.884 --> 15:18.920
You have a lot to live up to.

15:18.953 --> 15:22.489
Netherrealm has claim
to your soul.

15:22.522 --> 15:26.728
And your soul...
It has something I need.

15:26.761 --> 15:29.797
It was with you when you
perished on the island.

15:29.831 --> 15:31.799
That type of magic...

15:31.833 --> 15:34.334
is not so easily destroyed.

15:34.368 --> 15:37.705
The key and your soul
are intertwined.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.575
[Shinnok] You and the key
are one.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.814
My soldiers will escort you
to Earthrealm.

15:46.848 --> 15:48.850
To the Temple of Elements.

15:48.883 --> 15:52.352
You will open the gates
and bring me what's inside.

15:52.386 --> 15:57.691
Then, my brothers and sisters
will see how "mad" I really am.

15:57.725 --> 15:58.960
Or?

15:58.993 --> 16:01.628
Or I will flay you alive
until you perish,

16:01.662 --> 16:04.197
and then bring you back
to do it again.

16:04.899 --> 16:06.768
You cannot escape me.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.736
I can try.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.812
Find him.

16:17.845 --> 16:20.782
But Master,
he has escaped us before.

16:20.815 --> 16:23.650
Then find me someone
who can do it for you.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.287
[demons growling]

16:27.320 --> 16:29.389
Soon you shall
rise again,

and finally, the realms
will be no more.

Ahhh!

17:20.574 --> 17:21.809
You've gotten better.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.913
Not good enough.

17:25.946 --> 17:28.548
You're too hard on yourself,
Kuai Liang.

17:28.582 --> 17:30.785
You are a great fighter.

17:30.818 --> 17:32.887

With Outworld
attacking Earthrealm,

17:37.557 --> 17:40.393
and Cyrax and Sektor
still missing,

17:40.427 --> 17:43.898
it is time for you
to take your brother's place.

17:43.931 --> 17:46.901
The mantle
of Sub-Zero is yours.

17:47.969 --> 17:50.370
No. Not yet.

I'm sorry to interrupt
your training,

18:22.369 --> 18:24.906

18:24.939 --> 18:27.875
[Smoke] We live to serve,
Grandmaster.

18:27.909 --> 18:29.977
We've been hired
to find someone.

18:30.812 --> 18:33.480
Someone dangerous.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.515
It will take the combined might

18:35.549 --> 18:39.386
of the Lin Kuei
and even then...

18:39.419 --> 18:43.690
Our target is a member of
the Shirai Ryu.

18:43.724 --> 18:45.692
The Shirai Ryu are dead.

18:45.726 --> 18:50.597
So we thought,
but I'm afraid one remains.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.835
Hanzo Hasashi. Scorpion.

18:56.170 --> 18:57.772
Where?

18:57.805 --> 18:59.740
I will find him, Grandmaster.

18:59.774 --> 19:02.043
I will find him and kill him
for my clan...

19:03.044 --> 19:04.611
For my brother.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.882
No. He's to be taken alive.

19:07.915 --> 19:10.751
Alive? He killed Bi-Han!

19:10.785 --> 19:12.854
Know your place, Kuai Liang!

19:15.723 --> 19:17.825
This Scorpion...

19:17.859 --> 19:20.393
is said to be
the deadliest warrior

19:20.427 --> 19:25.398
the evil Shirai Ryu
has ever produced.

19:25.432 --> 19:28.668
In order to catch this mad man,

19:28.703 --> 19:30.171
you will have to be faster,

19:30.204 --> 19:32.974
and better than
you've ever been.

19:33.007 --> 19:35.508
We will not fail you,
Grandmaster.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.111
No, you won't.

19:37.144 --> 19:38.846
You can't.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.848
I've made sure of that.

19:40.882 --> 19:44.584
The Lin Kuei
have been experimenting

19:44.618 --> 19:47.621

for some time.

than we could have hoped for.

Well, then. Uh...
Ladies first.

are not gonna believe this.

Come on, Toto.
We don't have all day.

You have escaped Netherrealm
once again.

I am sure Shinnok would like it
to appear so.

28:28.710 --> 28:30.177
Why are you here?

28:30.210 --> 28:31.478
The key...

28:31.512 --> 28:33.380
From Shang Tsung's island.

28:33.414 --> 28:36.250
Shinnok says its magic has
intertwined with my soul.

28:36.283 --> 28:37.684
So...

28:37.719 --> 28:40.654
You are the only one
who can open the door

28:40.687 --> 28:42.623
to the last Kamidogu.

28:42.656 --> 28:43.991
[Scorpion] Kamidogu?

28:44.024 --> 28:47.194
Remnants of the One Being.

28:47.227 --> 28:50.964
After the Elder Gods rebelled,
they split him,

28:50.998 --> 28:53.233
and hid the pieces
throughout the realms.

28:53.267 --> 28:55.402
And if Shinnok gets them all?

28:55.436 --> 28:57.671
The One Being will reappear

28:57.705 --> 29:02.142
and begin to unravel the realms
until nothing is left.

Why would Shinnok want
to destroy everything?

for a reason.

29:11.118 --> 29:13.620
Then take the key out of me!
Destroy it!

29:13.654 --> 29:15.189
I cannot.

29:15.222 --> 29:16.523

you cannot?

- You are a god.
- No longer.

29:24.665 --> 29:26.500
Do not let them find you.

29:26.533 --> 29:29.670
And if they catch me,
what then?

29:29.704 --> 29:32.206
Maybe I should open the
door for them...

29:32.239 --> 29:34.208
End it all.

the fence

It is time you pick a side.

I believe that is what your wife
and child would have wanted.

30:08.342 --> 30:10.611
[Johnny] Not ominous at all.

30:10.644 --> 30:14.314
Welcome to the fortress
of Shao Kahn!

30:14.348 --> 30:15.616
Shang Tsung.

30:15.649 --> 30:17.752
You will have
your chance, Liu Kang.

30:17.785 --> 30:18.753
Still yourself.

30:18.786 --> 30:22.122
Yes. Heel, young pup.

30:22.155 --> 30:24.491
Continue to do
what your Master says.

30:25.192 --> 30:26.159
Follow me.

30:26.193 --> 30:27.594
The emperor's waiting.

30:37.805 --> 30:41.174
Greetings, warriors
of Earthrealm.

30:41.208 --> 30:43.343
Welcome to Outworld.

30:44.378 --> 30:46.446
Over the next two days,

30:46.480 --> 30:49.683
we shall determine
who will be worthy enough

30:49.717 --> 30:53.721
to be called the champion
of Mortal Kombat.

30:53.755 --> 30:58.091
As such, the rules state
that none shall be harmed

30:58.125 --> 31:00.494
outside of the tournament
itself.

31:00.527 --> 31:03.363
You may roam freely
within the fortress,

31:03.397 --> 31:04.832
but not beyond.

31:04.866 --> 31:08.669
Raiden, are you ready to begin?

31:08.703 --> 31:10.571
We are.

31:15.609 --> 31:18.412
[crowd cheering]

31:30.490 --> 31:32.359
[shouting]

31:34.227 --> 31:37.431
- Damn. And me without my bug spray.
- [chuckles]

31:39.934 --> 31:41.903
[Johnny] Okay!
You know New York.

31:41.936 --> 31:44.605
Unique New York. You know
you need unique New York.

31:44.638 --> 31:46.874
She makes a proper cup of
coffee in a copper coffee pot.

31:46.908 --> 31:49.142
She makes a proper cup of
coffee in a copper coffee pot.

31:49.176 --> 31:51.645
I slit a sheet a sheet I slit
and upon the slitted sheet I sit.

31:51.678 --> 31:53.848
[muffled laughter]

31:53.881 --> 31:54.849
Fight!

31:57.819 --> 31:59.419
[groaning]

31:59.453 --> 32:00.487
Aah!

32:00.520 --> 32:01.723
Ooh!

32:01.756 --> 32:04.524
That... was... my move.

32:04.558 --> 32:06.627
[gasping] I can't breathe.

32:07.594 --> 32:09.563
Don't be such a baby.

32:09.596 --> 32:11.933
It's just a kick in the nuts.

32:11.966 --> 32:13.935
[Johnny] Easy for you to say.

32:13.968 --> 32:16.670
You... don't... have nuts.

32:17.537 --> 32:20.273
[moaning, exhales]

32:20.307 --> 32:21.876
Lucky shot. Let's see you...

32:23.377 --> 32:24.678
Come on, Johnny.

32:29.884 --> 32:30.918
Unfair!

32:31.719 --> 32:32.586
[groaning]

32:37.859 --> 32:39.192
[grunts]

32:39.226 --> 32:40.527
No!

32:47.234 --> 32:49.503
[D'Vorah] Your boyfriend
is weak.

32:49.536 --> 32:52.974
Like all those from Earthrealm.

32:53.007 --> 32:54.942
Winner, D'Vorah.

32:54.976 --> 32:56.476
[cheering]

32:57.879 --> 32:59.479
What happened?

32:59.513 --> 33:01.615
Bug babe just kicked your ass.

33:01.648 --> 33:02.884
Are you okay?

33:02.917 --> 33:05.753
I, uh... I think so.
I could use...

33:05.787 --> 33:07.922
What?
What could you use?

33:07.955 --> 33:10.725
Some mouth to mouth?

33:12.659 --> 33:14.361
- Ugh!
- Ow!

33:14.394 --> 33:15.595
Where... Where are you going?

33:15.629 --> 33:17.564
I'm super injured.

33:17.597 --> 33:20.500
[scoffs] You will be if you
keep acting a fool.

33:20.534 --> 33:21.535
Come on.

33:22.970 --> 33:24.571
[Shao] Raiden...

33:24.604 --> 33:27.607
I hope you fare
better than your champions.

33:27.641 --> 33:30.845
[crowd laughing]

33:30.878 --> 33:32.312
- [Jade grunts]
- [Liu Kang groaning]

33:34.648 --> 33:36.316
[both grunting]

33:41.621 --> 33:42.489
[yells]

33:52.432 --> 33:53.333
Aah!

33:53.366 --> 33:54.736
[bones crunching]

34:02.676 --> 34:03.543
Whoa!

34:08.415 --> 34:09.282
[groaning]

34:20.094 --> 34:20.962
[screaming]

34:24.598 --> 34:26.833
Let's see if these metal arms

34:26.868 --> 34:29.369
rip as easily as flesh.

34:29.402 --> 34:31.906
Yeah, you do that.

34:37.377 --> 34:39.045
[metal creaking]

34:39.080 --> 34:40.580
[hissing]

34:41.348 --> 34:42.282
[grunts]

34:43.416 --> 34:44.284
[grunts]

34:46.087 --> 34:47.353
[screaming]

34:47.387 --> 34:49.322
Hurts, doesn't it?

34:53.527 --> 34:54.962
[screaming]

34:57.063 --> 34:59.000
[cheering]

34:59.901 --> 35:00.935
Enough!

35:00.968 --> 35:02.904
Let us retire for the evening.

35:03.670 --> 35:04.671
Guards!

35:04.705 --> 35:07.809
Take them to their chambers.

35:07.842 --> 35:11.045
Ooh. Well, look at that,
someone's a little testy.

35:11.078 --> 35:12.612
Must mean we're winning.

35:19.452 --> 35:20.487
[panting]

35:37.504 --> 35:38.371
[Scorpion grunts]

35:39.907 --> 35:42.743
Resistance will be met
with extreme force.

35:56.891 --> 35:57.758
[grunts]

35:59.827 --> 36:00.694
[groaning]

36:10.004 --> 36:11.105
[groaning]

36:15.609 --> 36:16.476
What?

36:17.979 --> 36:20.413
[Sub-Zero grunting]

36:20.447 --> 36:22.515
You shall pay
for my brother's death.

36:24.151 --> 36:25.853
[both grunting]

36:51.779 --> 36:52.780
Smoke.

36:53.848 --> 36:54.715

37:24.511 --> 37:25.645

[panting]

37:44.131 --> 37:45.665
[both grunting]

37:48.169 --> 37:50.905
Nice! The thunder god
bringing the thunder!

37:50.938 --> 37:52.073
It would seem.

37:54.942 --> 37:57.011
- [groaning]
- [bones crunching]

38:04.819 --> 38:05.820
[growling]

38:29.676 --> 38:30.811

38:30.845 --> 38:32.079

38:33.314 --> 38:35.282
[groaning]

38:37.650 --> 38:39.220
[crowd cheering]

38:45.092 --> 38:47.294
- Lord Raiden...
- I am fine.

39:13.120 --> 39:17.725
[Smoke] Place your hand
on the door.

39:17.758 --> 39:19.827
You don't know
what you're doing.

39:19.860 --> 39:23.264
You open this door,
you've doomed us all.

39:23.297 --> 39:27.068
Place your hand
on the door.

39:29.003 --> 39:30.171
[grunting]

39:51.325 --> 39:53.894
[Smoke] Objective achieved.

39:53.928 --> 39:56.931
Eliminate Shirai Ryu.

39:56.964 --> 39:58.598
[Scorpion] Forgive me, Harumi.

40:03.104 --> 40:04.171
[groaning]

40:09.210 --> 40:10.311
No one kills him.

40:11.112 --> 40:12.246
Except me.

40:30.364 --> 40:32.299
Hey, where's the food court
around here?

40:32.333 --> 40:33.868
Do you have a menu?

40:33.901 --> 40:35.369
I could also use a spa,
I wanna work out

40:35.402 --> 40:38.739
after that ass kicking
I was handed.

40:38.772 --> 40:40.407
Okay, dick, nice chat.

40:46.847 --> 40:48.382
A couple of beds in here.

40:48.415 --> 40:50.184
Think I'll get some shut eye
while I can.

40:50.918 --> 40:52.887
If I can.

40:52.920 --> 40:54.989
Because I'm on another world.

40:55.022 --> 40:56.824
In an evil dictator's castle.

40:57.458 --> 40:58.926
Totally normal.

41:01.028 --> 41:03.030
He's right. I'll see you
in the morning.

41:03.063 --> 41:03.931
Wait.

41:06.767 --> 41:08.068
Right. Right. Right...

41:08.102 --> 41:09.870
Not without permission.

41:09.904 --> 41:11.972
So... Maybe we could uh...

41:12.006 --> 41:13.274
Could what?

41:13.307 --> 41:15.142
I don't know. Hang out.

41:16.076 --> 41:17.111
Talk.

41:18.179 --> 41:19.713
I'm going to bed.

41:22.082 --> 41:24.818
You know, there was a time

41:24.852 --> 41:28.189
no girl could withstand
my charms.

41:28.222 --> 41:31.492
Listen, Jack attack,
you know her best.

41:31.525 --> 41:33.194
Could you put in
a good word for me?

41:33.227 --> 41:35.796
You want a chance
with a lady like that,

41:35.829 --> 41:39.967
it'll take more than some
expensive veneers and perfect hair.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.002
[scoffs] It's never
failed me before.

41:42.036 --> 41:43.737
Yeah... You look like

41:43.771 --> 41:45.339
a collection
of great life choices.

41:46.407 --> 41:48.242
Women need to be wooed, Johnny.

41:48.275 --> 41:50.377
Pursued. Not coerced.

41:50.411 --> 41:52.279
Isn't that the same thing?

41:52.313 --> 41:54.481
[sighing] Good night, Romeo.

42:00.054 --> 42:01.222
[Liu] You should rest,
Lord Raiden.

42:01.255 --> 42:03.390
Thank you for your concern.

42:03.424 --> 42:05.492
- I'm fine.
- Are you?

42:05.526 --> 42:08.362
Is there something you want
to say, Liu Kang?

42:08.395 --> 42:09.930
It's just that...

42:09.964 --> 42:11.098
Lord Raiden, your fight
from earlier...

42:11.131 --> 42:12.399
I'm worried that...

42:12.433 --> 42:14.935
I appreciate your concern,
young one.

42:14.969 --> 42:17.271
I am merely getting used
to life as a...

42:17.304 --> 42:18.472
Mortal.

42:18.505 --> 42:20.241
I will be fine.

42:20.274 --> 42:21.875
I promise.

42:21.909 --> 42:25.179
Now... Off to sleep.

42:25.212 --> 42:27.181
Something I do not
think I have done in...

42:27.214 --> 42:30.317
Well... Ever.

42:30.351 --> 42:32.486
It should be
quite the experience!

42:41.095 --> 42:42.329
[wind blowing]

42:55.976 --> 42:57.878
You killed my brother!

42:59.546 --> 43:02.049
I did. And... I'm sorry.

43:02.082 --> 43:03.951
Sorry doesn't bring him back.

43:03.984 --> 43:06.553
Your clan,
they killed my people...

43:06.587 --> 43:09.089
My son, my wife...

43:09.123 --> 43:10.891
The man that led that raid

43:10.924 --> 43:13.360
used magic to appear
as your brother.

43:13.394 --> 43:14.295
Lies!

43:15.396 --> 43:17.331
[both grunting]

43:58.138 --> 43:59.073
[yelling]

44:20.394 --> 44:22.062
[Scorpion] Listen to me.

44:22.096 --> 44:25.299
They will destroy us both
if we don't work together.

44:25.332 --> 44:27.368
Help me... or we die.

44:30.938 --> 44:31.605
[yelling]

45:05.539 --> 45:06.907
[both grunting]

45:09.410 --> 45:12.246
Listen, there is no
time for this.

45:12.279 --> 45:14.014
That's the Kamidogu.

45:14.047 --> 45:18.085
If they get that,
all the realms are doomed.

45:18.118 --> 45:22.990
Your thirst for vengeance will
disappear along with all of reality.

45:23.023 --> 45:24.391
You are lying.

45:24.425 --> 45:25.993
I'm not.

45:26.026 --> 45:29.062
- I don't care!
- Yes, you do.

45:29.096 --> 45:30.597
That's what
makes you different.

45:30.631 --> 45:33.534
That's what makes you better.

45:33.567 --> 45:36.336
[Scorpion] I know
the desire for revenge.

45:36.370 --> 45:39.173
It's a sickness
that eats at your soul

45:39.206 --> 45:41.843
until you become a monster
of regret and pain.

45:45.713 --> 45:47.749
I deserve to die.

45:47.782 --> 45:50.617
And it would be fitting
if you did it.

45:50.651 --> 45:53.420
So kill me, if you must.

45:53.454 --> 45:56.356
But promise me
you'll take that Kamidogu

45:56.390 --> 45:58.726
and keep it
from those monstrosities.

45:59.493 --> 46:00.527
Do it.

46:01.195 --> 46:02.563
[yelling]

46:09.303 --> 46:10.671
[panting]

46:12.306 --> 46:15.375
I will never forgive you.

46:15.409 --> 46:17.077
Neither will I.

46:24.318 --> 46:25.185
[grunting]

46:33.560 --> 46:35.095
[electricity buzzing]

46:37.364 --> 46:38.800
Brother. Don't.

46:38.833 --> 46:41.635
We've been lied to.
Whoever hired the Lin Kuei

46:41.668 --> 46:44.104
wants this for an evil purpose.

46:44.137 --> 46:45.472
You can't give it to them.

46:47.341 --> 46:49.676
It is our objective.

46:57.484 --> 46:58.385
[groaning]

47:10.230 --> 47:13.233
Is it me, or does Sonya look
really pissed?

47:13.267 --> 47:14.736
[yelling]

47:14.769 --> 47:16.637
Yeah. I figured
that would happen.

47:16.670 --> 47:18.639
What would happen?

47:18.672 --> 47:21.275
Well, bug lady there made the
mistake of hitting Sonya's man...

47:21.308 --> 47:24.044
<i>Moi.</i> She's defending my honor.

47:25.379 --> 47:27.180

48:21.736 --> 48:24.137
What... the hell?

48:24.171 --> 48:25.672
I don't know what you are.

48:25.707 --> 48:28.910
But it's time to go back
to the hell you came from!

48:28.943 --> 48:30.277
[both grunting]

48:31.779 --> 48:32.646
Ah!

No. Stop!

Stryker!

49:11.853 --> 49:13.220
Finish him!

49:22.429 --> 49:23.630
[man laughing]

49:23.664 --> 49:25.332
You're next.

49:25.833 --> 49:28.335
[laughing]

49:41.015 --> 49:42.549
We failed.

49:42.582 --> 49:44.919
No, not yet.

49:44.952 --> 49:48.790
Come. It's time
to find redemption.

50:08.408 --> 50:10.310
- He can't.
- Liu Kang.

50:10.343 --> 50:12.579
Mortal Kombat
has been declared.

50:12.612 --> 50:14.314
This is Kung Lao's fight.

50:18.720 --> 50:21.688
Are you ready
to die, young one?

50:21.723 --> 50:23.390
I'm Kung Lao,

50:23.423 --> 50:25.692
descendant of
the Great Kung Lao.

50:25.727 --> 50:28.562
It is you, who should be ready
to die, Shao Kahn.

50:32.934 --> 50:34.267
[grunting]

50:43.778 --> 50:44.644
No.

[whimpering]

51:14.742 --> 51:16.711
[screaming]

51:19.747 --> 51:20.647
No!

51:25.352 --> 51:26.020
[whimpering]

51:30.792 --> 51:31.993
Fatality.

51:38.665 --> 51:41.568
[Raiden] I know he was
like a brother to you.

51:41.601 --> 51:43.805
But he died as he lived.

51:43.838 --> 51:45.438
A warrior.

51:45.472 --> 51:48.575
His sacrifice
will not be in vain.

51:48.608 --> 51:51.444
Kitana... No mercy.

51:51.478 --> 51:52.914
Yes, your highness.

51:57.785 --> 52:00.087
It is never too late, Kitana.

52:01.856 --> 52:02.790
Fight.

[squelching]

52:41.128 --> 52:43.597
[grunting]

52:48.870 --> 52:50.470
Traitor!

52:50.503 --> 52:54.742
No. Queen of Outworld.

52:54.775 --> 52:58.112
As rightful heir, I hereby
surrender to Earthrealm,

52:58.145 --> 53:00.882
so they may unmerge Edenia
and the other realms

53:00.915 --> 53:02.783
from the grasp of tyranny!

53:02.817 --> 53:05.753
[laughing]

53:10.124 --> 53:12.827
You wretched child.

53:12.860 --> 53:16.496
Did you think I would be
so easily defeated?

53:17.064 --> 53:18.165
[yelling]

53:22.502 --> 53:23.170
[grunting]

53:27.942 --> 53:28.809

53:33.613 --> 53:34.681
Finish it.

53:35.816 --> 53:38.819
[Shao] Kill you? No!

53:38.853 --> 53:40.788
You'll stay alive.

53:40.821 --> 53:44.025
Watching as I merge the realms.

53:44.058 --> 53:45.592
Then...

53:45.625 --> 53:49.596
when you've seen
all that you love destroyed,

53:49.629 --> 53:52.532
then I'll kill you.

53:52.565 --> 53:55.136
- [spits]
- [crowd exclaims]

53:55.803 --> 53:57.171
[grunts]

53:58.940 --> 53:59.974
Take her away!

54:02.642 --> 54:04.145
Who's next?

54:06.747 --> 54:09.616
[both grunting, groaning]

54:34.709 --> 54:37.745
Come on, baby.
You'll be all right.

54:38.846 --> 54:40.147
[scoffs]

54:40.181 --> 54:43.050
[all cheering]

54:48.789 --> 54:52.559
I've been waiting a long time
for this, boy.

54:54.729 --> 54:55.963
So have I.

54:57.898 --> 54:58.899
[knuckles cracking]

54:59.566 --> 55:00.533
Fight.

55:00.567 --> 55:02.970
[both grunting]

55:13.147 --> 55:14.782
[groaning]

55:14.815 --> 55:17.051
[grunting]

55:19.987 --> 55:22.189
I expected better.

[groans]

55:36.771 --> 55:37.838
[yells]

55:37.872 --> 55:39.040
Liu Kang.

55:39.073 --> 55:41.108
[panting]

55:41.142 --> 55:44.979
Surrender now,
and I might let you live.

55:45.012 --> 55:48.581
Your arrogance,
knows no bounds, Shang Tsung.

55:48.615 --> 55:51.651
I do not need my arm
to beat the likes of you.

55:52.987 --> 55:54.155
[gasps]

55:55.655 --> 55:56.656

Finish him.

56:22.983 --> 56:25.352
[yelling]

56:28.222 --> 56:29.723
Huh?

56:29.757 --> 56:32.659
No. Live with knowing
I defeated you,

56:32.692 --> 56:34.295
and it wasn't even close.

56:42.269 --> 56:43.804
What did he do to me?

56:45.306 --> 56:48.309
[Raiden] Some sort of... curse.

56:48.342 --> 56:50.077
If I were still a god,
I could...

56:50.111 --> 56:52.213
But you aren't.

56:52.246 --> 56:56.016
Oh, great! Our second greatest
fighter is sidelined.

56:56.050 --> 56:58.219
- What now?
- We fight.

56:58.252 --> 57:01.155
We win at all costs.

57:04.125 --> 57:06.693
[Shinnok] Soon...
Soon you will rise,

57:06.727 --> 57:09.662
and take the realms
for your own.

57:09.696 --> 57:12.833
No more pain.
No more suffering.

57:13.700 --> 57:16.370
No more... anything!

57:20.875 --> 57:21.775
You have it?

57:21.809 --> 57:25.112
The Lin Kuei never fail.

57:27.948 --> 57:29.216
At last.

57:29.250 --> 57:32.253
The final piece
of the Kamidogu!

57:32.286 --> 57:34.121
The Kamidogu...

57:34.155 --> 57:38.225
[Shinnok] What? You thought
I had you chasing some bauble?

57:38.259 --> 57:40.828
But... if it is put together...

57:40.861 --> 57:44.965
The One Being will come back
and destroy all of existence?

57:44.999 --> 57:49.236
Yes! It is said the mad
god Shinnok has searched...

57:50.437 --> 57:53.240
You're Shinnok!

57:53.274 --> 57:58.812
Ah. Now you realize the
pitfalls of being a mercenary.

57:58.846 --> 58:00.247
But don't worry...

58:00.281 --> 58:02.116
I have your payment...

58:02.983 --> 58:04.752
in full.

58:04.785 --> 58:06.153
Children.

58:08.956 --> 58:10.224

58:50.931 --> 58:53.500
Huh. [groans]

58:55.369 --> 58:57.838
Kratakoth!

58:57.871 --> 59:00.174
Malentakoth!

59:00.207 --> 59:02.076
Responde!

59:06.981 --> 59:08.148
No.

59:08.182 --> 59:11.285
[groaning, yells]

59:17.858 --> 59:21.328
- Lord Raiden, don't... I can...
- Do not fear for me.

59:21.362 --> 59:23.530
This is what I am meant to do.

59:23.564 --> 59:25.933
To protect Earthrealm.

59:25.966 --> 59:27.134
To protect you.

59:28.202 --> 59:30.137
[dramatic music playing]

59:33.340 --> 59:36.377
[Shao] Ah. At last.

59:36.410 --> 59:38.312
As it should be.

59:38.345 --> 59:40.080
You and I...

59:40.114 --> 59:41.915
to the death.

59:44.151 --> 59:45.419
[grunts]

59:45.452 --> 59:46.520
[groans]

59:48.222 --> 59:49.857
You talk too much.

01:00:39.673 --> 01:00:42.576

01:01:00.127 --> 01:01:02.296
[sobbing]

01:01:08.635 --> 01:01:12.373
Your destiny was never
to defeat Goro, Liu Kang.

01:01:12.406 --> 01:01:15.609
It was to defeat Shao Kahn.

01:01:24.218 --> 01:01:25.986
It is over.

01:01:26.019 --> 01:01:28.255

What the hell is he doing?

01:01:36.163 --> 01:01:37.598
Protecting Earthrealm.

01:01:37.631 --> 01:01:40.467
Yes, come to me.

01:01:40.501 --> 01:01:43.103
Come to die!

01:01:43.137 --> 01:01:45.072

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.342

It's over.

01:03:56.236 --> 01:03:59.306
- You did it.
- We did it.

01:03:59.339 --> 01:04:01.241
[Elder God] Liu Kang...

01:04:05.679 --> 01:04:09.149
You have won
the final Mortal Kombat.

01:04:09.182 --> 01:04:12.319
For that,
you are awarded great power.

01:04:12.352 --> 01:04:14.488
But we fear,

01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:18.091
it may not be enough.

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:20.427
Enough? For what?

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.195
The One Being.

Yes, the One Being!

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.729
The end...

01:05:28.362 --> 01:05:29.663

What... What is happening?

01:05:49.282 --> 01:05:51.251
The end of the realms!

01:05:54.822 --> 01:05:57.792
The realms are merging.

01:05:57.825 --> 01:05:59.593
Hurry.

01:06:01.763 --> 01:06:04.631
Lord Raiden told us of a child.

01:06:04.665 --> 01:06:05.867
The chosen one.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.769
A soul so pure

01:06:07.802 --> 01:06:09.703
that he could hold our power

01:06:09.737 --> 01:06:11.706
and save the realms.

01:06:11.739 --> 01:06:14.876
You... are that child,
Liu Kang.

01:06:14.909 --> 01:06:17.444
And this is your final battle.

01:06:18.345 --> 01:06:19.747

Whoa.

01:07:26.313 --> 01:07:28.783
Scorpion? I thought
you were dead.

01:07:28.816 --> 01:07:30.718
- I was.
- What are you doing here?

01:07:30.752 --> 01:07:33.286
Trying to stop that.

01:07:38.692 --> 01:07:42.864
Let the unmaking... begin!

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:02.382

This is my fight now.

01:08:12.592 --> 01:08:14.427
Why am I the chosen one?

01:08:14.461 --> 01:08:17.330
Because I chose you.

01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:21.701
And I chose you

01:08:21.736 --> 01:08:24.437
because of what is in here.

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:26.707
You have lost much
in this life.

01:08:26.741 --> 01:08:29.810
And yet, blame no one.

01:08:29.844 --> 01:08:32.444
Never stop fighting, Liu Kang.

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:34.514
As long as you stand,

01:08:34.548 --> 01:08:37.384
goodness and light
will stand also.

01:08:39.618 --> 01:08:41.421
I am the chosen one.

01:08:48.528 --> 01:08:49.563
[yells]

01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:54.902
[growls]

01:08:59.471 --> 01:09:01.742
[Johnny] What the fuck?
Look at that.

01:09:01.776 --> 01:09:03.010
What now?

01:09:03.044 --> 01:09:05.078
Now, we open my luggage.

01:09:08.716 --> 01:09:12.053
I'd kiss you, but your
boyfriend might get jealous.

01:09:12.086 --> 01:09:14.421
- Not my boyfriend.
- [gun cocking]

01:09:14.453 --> 01:09:16.756
Listen,
with the realms merging,

01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:18.692
there's a lot of
innocent people in harm's way.

01:09:18.725 --> 01:09:21.595
Spread out and help them.

01:09:21.627 --> 01:09:23.363
[monster growls]

01:09:27.134 --> 01:09:28.903
- [both gasp]
- [blade swishing]

01:09:35.675 --> 01:09:37.510
Get to shelter. Quickly.

01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:45.086
[groans]

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.956
[all growling]

01:10:07.641 --> 01:10:10.477
Major Jackson Briggs,
reporting for duty.

01:10:11.478 --> 01:10:13.513
Everyone get behind me.

01:10:17.852 --> 01:10:20.420
Well, what are you waiting for?
An invitation?

01:10:28.528 --> 01:10:29.730
[grunting]

01:10:34.001 --> 01:10:36.904
[monsters groaning]

01:10:36.938 --> 01:10:38.172
[Johnny] Get some, get some,
get some.

01:10:39.707 --> 01:10:41.108
[growling]

01:10:41.142 --> 01:10:42.575
[clicking]

01:10:42.609 --> 01:10:43.677
Uh!

01:10:46.881 --> 01:10:49.050
- I'm out.
- Me too.

01:10:49.083 --> 01:10:50.184
- [monster growls]
- [gasps]

01:10:50.217 --> 01:10:52.153
- [yells]
- [grunts]

01:10:54.521 --> 01:10:55.823
[both straining]

01:10:57.091 --> 01:10:59.626
[grunting]

01:11:04.799 --> 01:11:06.000
[sighs]

01:11:06.033 --> 01:11:07.500
[growls]

01:11:08.903 --> 01:11:09.870
[screams]

01:11:11.205 --> 01:11:13.007
- [groans]
- Sonya!

01:11:14.875 --> 01:11:16.777
[groaning]

01:11:19.246 --> 01:11:22.249
Sonya... Sonya, stay with me.

01:11:22.283 --> 01:11:24.584
[groaning]

01:11:24.617 --> 01:11:26.619
I'm sorry for being an idiot.

01:11:26.653 --> 01:11:28.022
You deserve so much more.

01:11:28.055 --> 01:11:29.757
This fight, all the death...

01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:32.026
it was worth it, to meet you.

01:11:32.692 --> 01:11:33.928
[snarls]

01:11:35.595 --> 01:11:38.265
You really mean it, don't you?

01:11:38.299 --> 01:11:41.302
Then... I guess we should
get out of here,

01:11:41.335 --> 01:11:43.670
and... talk.

01:11:45.306 --> 01:11:47.674
- I love you.
- No shit.

01:11:48.608 --> 01:11:49.609
[Sonya grunts]

01:11:50.778 --> 01:11:52.579
[upbeat music playing]

01:11:55.983 --> 01:11:58.585
[straining]

01:12:21.976 --> 01:12:23.010
[straining]

01:12:24.745 --> 01:12:26.180
[groans]

01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:32.585
[Liu screaming]

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.595
[labored breathing]

01:12:51.806 --> 01:12:54.708
[One Being] You never
could have won.

01:12:56.177 --> 01:12:59.113
The destiny of the realms...

01:13:00.047 --> 01:13:01.982
is oblivion.

01:13:03.117 --> 01:13:04.118
[growls]

01:13:09.689 --> 01:13:12.026
[grunting]

01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:24.671
[grunting]

01:13:29.977 --> 01:13:31.312
[grunts]

01:13:31.345 --> 01:13:33.180
[One Being growls]

01:13:35.349 --> 01:13:37.418
[grunts]

01:13:37.451 --> 01:13:39.320
[intense music playing]

01:13:46.293 --> 01:13:48.162
Get over here!

01:13:51.966 --> 01:13:53.067
[groans]

01:14:07.481 --> 01:14:09.717
[footsteps approaching]

01:14:14.188 --> 01:14:16.323
Aw... shit.

01:14:20.094 --> 01:14:21.061
[shrieks]

01:14:22.496 --> 01:14:24.198
[One Being grunts]

01:14:26.233 --> 01:14:28.402
[groans, thuds]

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.975
[One Being] No...

01:14:35.009 --> 01:14:37.344
I am eternal.

01:14:37.378 --> 01:14:40.080
I am everything.

01:14:40.114 --> 01:14:41.782
[groans]

01:14:42.783 --> 01:14:45.152
Impossible!

01:14:46.453 --> 01:14:48.322
[groans]

01:14:53.294 --> 01:14:54.895
[snarls]

01:14:54.929 --> 01:14:57.464
You don't deserve this.

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.035
[growls]

01:15:09.877 --> 01:15:11.378
[One Being groans]

01:15:11.412 --> 01:15:13.781
[panting]

01:15:14.848 --> 01:15:16.917
[gasps, groans]

01:15:19.353 --> 01:15:20.854
[screaming]

01:15:23.224 --> 01:15:24.858
[continues screaming loudly]

01:15:37.905 --> 01:15:41.141
Liu? Liu? Are you there?

01:15:41.175 --> 01:15:43.444
Yes, and no.

01:15:43.477 --> 01:15:45.179
It is difficult to explain.

01:15:45.212 --> 01:15:46.480
Is it over?

01:15:46.513 --> 01:15:48.015
No, not yet.

01:16:20.881 --> 01:16:22.049
[exclaims]

01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:26.320
- Now, is it over?
- [kisses]

01:16:26.353 --> 01:16:29.523
Yes, the realms
have been separated.

01:16:29.556 --> 01:16:31.859
Edenia is free once more.

01:16:31.892 --> 01:16:33.961
No more tournaments.
No more gods.

01:16:33.994 --> 01:16:36.297
Just peace.
As it should be.

01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:38.899
Yeah? I've heard that before.

01:16:38.932 --> 01:16:41.068
Shao Kahn's body is gone.

01:16:41.101 --> 01:16:42.936
What happens when he
or someone else

01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:45.239
gets the itch to take over
Earthrealm again?

01:16:45.272 --> 01:16:48.409
Then we'll be there
to stop them... together.

01:16:50.411 --> 01:16:53.414
- Whoa! Hey, I don't remember giving you perm...
- [kisses]

01:16:58.652 --> 01:17:00.854
[triumphant music playing]

01:17:07.928 --> 01:17:09.363
[thunder rumbling]

01:17:13.267 --> 01:17:15.936
[closing music playing]
