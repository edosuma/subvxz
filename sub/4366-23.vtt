00:01.722 --> 00:04.156
You are being watched.

00:04.157 --> 00:06.392
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.393 --> 00:10.929
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.930 --> 00:13.432
I know because I built it.

00:13.433 --> 00:15.734
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:15.735 --> 00:17.570
but it sees everything...

00:17.571 --> 00:20.338
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

00:20.339 --> 00:21.839
people like you,

00:21.840 --> 00:25.343
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:25.344 --> 00:27.778
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:27.779 --> 00:29.547
But I needed a partner--

00:29.548 --> 00:33.651
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:33.652 --> 00:37.887
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:37.888 --> 00:39.423
You will never find us.

00:39.424 --> 00:41.758
But victim or perpetrator,

00:41.759 --> 00:44.194
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

Our mutual friend
needs help, detective.

01:02.246 --> 01:03.446
He's downtown.

01:03.447 --> 01:05.848
I'll be there as soon
as I get finished here.

01:05.849 --> 01:07.982
I hate to be rude, but it's
an emergency, detective.

01:07.983 --> 01:10.452
We need you now.

01:16.559 --> 01:17.892
I need you to come with me now.

01:17.893 --> 01:18.960
But I have
this thing--

01:18.961 --> 01:22.396
Not anymore, you haven't.

01:24.366 --> 01:25.832
It's an article of faith for me

01:25.833 --> 01:28.101
that all criminals,
however clever,

01:28.102 --> 01:29.870
eventually trip themselves up.

01:29.871 --> 01:32.173
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

01:32.174 --> 01:35.008

Morning, Finch.

01:53.527 --> 01:55.060
Mr. Reese.

01:55.061 --> 01:56.061
What have you been doing?

01:56.062 --> 01:59.298
Corrupting detective Fusco.

01:59.299 --> 02:01.200
Does he really need any help
in that regard?

02:01.201 --> 02:03.335
I'm encouraging him
to show ambition,

02:03.336 --> 02:05.103
to climb the HR ladder.

02:05.104 --> 02:08.707
Afraid it'll have to wait.
We got a new number.

02:08.708 --> 02:10.608
Caroline Turing.

02:10.609 --> 02:11.842
Oh.

02:11.843 --> 02:13.777
She's lot prettier than Fusco.

02:13.778 --> 02:15.279
And much more discreet.

02:15.280 --> 02:18.148
Her online profile
is carefully managed.

02:18.149 --> 02:19.684
Think she's got
something to hide?

02:19.685 --> 02:21.219
Many things, I would expect.

02:21.220 --> 02:22.886
She's a psychologist.

02:22.887 --> 02:24.422
From what I can determine,

02:24.423 --> 02:27.490
she specializes
in the high-end clients,

02:27.491 --> 02:31.261
the sort who insist
on discretion.

02:31.262 --> 02:33.096
While I dig deeper,
you get close to her,

02:33.097 --> 02:35.732
see if you can work out
where the threat is coming from.

02:35.733 --> 02:37.867
She could be the threat, Finch.

02:37.868 --> 02:40.136
I'm sure you'll work
that out too.

02:45.210 --> 02:47.543

02:48.010 --> 02:50.312

[Phone rings]

02:57.120 --> 02:58.720
Yes, Lionel.

02:58.721 --> 03:01.088
I think I'm about to meet a
few of the big hitters from HR.

03:01.089 --> 03:02.457
I'm thrilled for you.

03:02.458 --> 03:03.725
I thought you'd want
to be there.

03:03.726 --> 03:05.793
We could take
these bastards down.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.027
All in good time.

03:07.028 --> 03:08.963
It's my balls
in a vice here, all right?

03:08.964 --> 03:10.931
Plus Carter keeps
giving me the stink-eye.

03:10.932 --> 03:12.233
Now we need
to wrap this thing up.

03:12.234 --> 03:15.235
And we will, Lionel,
when I say so.

03:15.236 --> 03:18.639
Meantime, I want you
to look into someone else.

03:18.640 --> 03:22.309
Caroline Turing.
Sending you a photograph.

03:22.310 --> 03:24.611
Get back to me
when you got something.

03:31.318 --> 03:33.753
Do you think
I'm not understanding you?

03:33.754 --> 03:35.321
Yeah, I do.

03:35.322 --> 03:37.690
Giving me signals,
putting words in my mouth.

03:37.691 --> 03:39.558
And I'm concerned
about the things

03:39.559 --> 03:42.495
I've already confided in you.

03:42.496 --> 03:45.964
I thought we agreed no notes.

03:45.965 --> 03:48.232
We did.
Um...

03:48.233 --> 03:50.101
Sorry, old habits.

03:50.102 --> 03:52.470
The things I've told you,
if anyone else heard them,

03:52.471 --> 03:54.639
that could be
a big problem, understand?

03:54.640 --> 03:57.342
For whom, Hans?

03:57.343 --> 04:00.211
- You or me?
- Both of us.

04:02.114 --> 04:05.649
You understand me now?

04:15.360 --> 04:16.660
Councilman Larsson,

04:16.661 --> 04:18.961

Captain Lewis.

04:20.297 --> 04:24.334
Isis is Detective Fusco.

04:24.335 --> 04:27.069
We hear you got
dirty fingers, Fusco.

04:27.070 --> 04:29.939
Fingers? I heard he's got
his snout buried

04:29.940 --> 04:31.173
in the damn trough.

04:31.174 --> 04:33.343
City Council
and the district attorney

04:33.344 --> 04:37.312
no longer tolerate any
malfeasance by NYPD officers.

04:40.616 --> 04:42.050
What do you got
to say for yourself?

04:42.051 --> 04:44.820
You know,
I-I don't know, uh...

04:44.821 --> 04:48.156
[Laughter]

04:48.157 --> 04:51.525

No social niceties.

04:51.526 --> 04:52.626
What's on the docket?

04:52.627 --> 04:54.562
We got a contract.

04:54.563 --> 04:57.531
Rich guy with a problem.
He needs to go away.

04:57.532 --> 04:59.700
Method is up to you.

04:59.701 --> 05:02.837
Speed is the only stipulation.

05:02.838 --> 05:05.105
You gonna pick
the shooter, Simmons?

05:05.106 --> 05:06.740
My guys are all solid.

05:06.741 --> 05:09.909
Fusco here will run interference
with homicide

05:09.910 --> 05:12.879
in case there's any questions.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.980
If I'm gonna
look after somebody,

05:13.981 --> 05:14.947
I'm gonna need
to know their names.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.417
No. You don't.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.755
Now the question is
do we trust the rich guy?

05:21.756 --> 05:24.857
I trust his money.
It's already in escrow.

05:24.858 --> 05:28.260
Here is a down payment
for expenses.

05:39.471 --> 05:43.708
I'm sorry,
but in order to help you,

05:43.709 --> 05:45.476
I have to have your trust.

05:45.477 --> 05:47.111
Clearly I don't.

05:47.112 --> 05:51.048
I'm referring you
to another therapist.

05:51.049 --> 05:52.383
You're firing me?

05:52.384 --> 05:56.319
No, I--
I'm admitting failure.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.254
I'm firing myself.

05:58.255 --> 05:59.723
You have issues to resolve,

05:59.724 --> 06:02.358
and you need to be able
to speak freely.

06:02.359 --> 06:04.327
Finch, are you listening
to this?

06:04.328 --> 06:08.698
It seems some of Ms. Turing's
patients are a little... Clingy.

06:08.699 --> 06:09.900
I've been open.

06:09.901 --> 06:12.135
I laid myself bare to you.

06:12.136 --> 06:16.105
I'm helping you, believe me.

[Camera clicks]

06:23.447 --> 06:25.014
What now?

06:25.015 --> 06:27.416
Yeah, nice to talk to you too.

06:27.417 --> 06:30.685
I met them.
The HR inner council.

06:30.686 --> 06:33.221
So what was it about,
handshakes and single malts?

06:33.222 --> 06:34.456
No, this was serious.

06:34.457 --> 06:36.458
HR is going in
the murder-for-hire business.

06:36.459 --> 06:37.759
Do you know the target?

06:37.760 --> 06:40.695
Yeah, I know the target.
You do too.

06:40.696 --> 06:43.664
It's that lady shrink
you asked me to look into.

06:43.665 --> 06:46.500
48 hours and she's dead.

07:00.982 --> 07:03.817
Thermostat has
a motion detector camera.

07:03.818 --> 07:05.384
It'll capture the face
of any patient

07:05.385 --> 07:08.054
coming or going
from Ms. Turing's office.

07:08.055 --> 07:09.455
Should be able to identify

07:09.456 --> 07:11.324
the more prominent ones
in no time.

07:11.325 --> 07:14.459
I'm guessing one of them
hired HR to keep her quiet.

07:14.460 --> 07:16.528
Question is...

07:16.529 --> 07:18.964
Which one?
Till we figure that out,

07:18.965 --> 07:21.366
I'm going to want to stay as
close to Turing as possible.

07:21.367 --> 07:23.435
I agree.

07:23.436 --> 07:25.971
Time for you to work through
some of your issues, Mr. Reese.

07:25.972 --> 07:28.906
Issues?

07:28.907 --> 07:33.277
Tell me, what is it
you do, Mr...

07:33.278 --> 07:35.013
Rooney.

07:35.014 --> 07:38.182
I'm a-- a consultant.
It's complicated.

07:38.183 --> 07:39.884
Not really important.

07:39.885 --> 07:41.418
I'm not so sure.

07:41.419 --> 07:45.288
I find business is often
personal with my patients.

07:45.289 --> 07:47.490
I was told I could count
on your discretion.

07:47.491 --> 07:49.459
My clients are private people.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.995
I respect that,

07:51.996 --> 07:54.765
and I will protect it
at all cost.

07:54.766 --> 07:57.233
Lady after my own heart.

07:57.234 --> 07:59.669
So what brings you
to seek therapy?

07:59.670 --> 08:01.837
You mind closing the blinds?

08:01.838 --> 08:05.041
If it makes you more comfortable.

08:05.042 --> 08:08.210
Would you care
for something to drink?

08:08.211 --> 08:11.613
Water would be fine, thank you.

08:18.421 --> 08:19.754

08:19.755 --> 08:23.425

08:23.426 --> 08:26.228

her clients' initials.

08:26.229 --> 08:27.862
The lady is careful.

08:27.863 --> 08:31.300

08:31.301 --> 08:34.868
Detective, any luck with
Councilman Larsson's finances?

08:34.869 --> 08:37.037
He signed a deposit
at his bank this week

08:37.038 --> 08:39.039
for $500,000.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.875
Nice chunk of change
for a public employee.

08:41.876 --> 08:43.376
We know where it came from?

08:43.378 --> 08:45.713
An escrow account held
at that same institution

08:45.714 --> 08:48.082
made a disbursement that day
in the same amount.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.416
Send me the tracking number
for the account.

08:49.417 --> 08:50.684
I'll take it from here.

08:50.685 --> 08:52.885
What is the fine councilman
mixed up in here?

08:52.886 --> 08:55.622
Murder for hire, Detective.

08:55.623 --> 08:57.257
HR is branching out.

08:57.258 --> 08:59.926
We'll be in touch.

09:03.264 --> 09:07.899
Tell me, what do you see
as the goal?

09:07.900 --> 09:09.268
Uh, the goal?

09:09.269 --> 09:12.538
The purpose for your visit?

09:12.539 --> 09:16.174
You seem a little
agitated right now.

09:16.175 --> 09:17.843
Why would you say that?

09:17.844 --> 09:21.246
Body language,
closing the blinds.

09:21.247 --> 09:23.248
You don't like windows, do you?

09:23.249 --> 09:24.949
What is it you're afraid of?

09:24.950 --> 09:27.652
That's funny, I was gonna
ask you the same thing.

09:27.653 --> 09:29.587
Me?

09:29.588 --> 09:33.023
You have a panic button
installed under your desk.

09:33.024 --> 09:34.392
Is that recent?

09:34.393 --> 09:36.727
Or someone you're afraid of?

09:36.728 --> 09:41.164
You're highly observant,

09:41.165 --> 09:45.802
hypervigilant,
aware of your surroundings.

09:45.803 --> 09:47.571
You're saying I'm paranoid.

09:47.572 --> 09:49.439
Is that what you think?

09:49.440 --> 09:54.243
I was thinking something else.

09:54.244 --> 09:57.713
Former military?

09:57.714 --> 09:59.315
Tread carefully,
Mr. Reese.

09:59.316 --> 10:03.218
- Is it that obvious?
- A little.

10:03.219 --> 10:05.721
The way you walk into a room.

10:05.722 --> 10:08.556
The way you sit
facing the door.

10:08.557 --> 10:11.959
You see the world differently
than most, don't you?

10:11.960 --> 10:16.464
A threat around every corner.

10:16.465 --> 10:20.435
Tell me, do you feel the need
to protect people?

10:20.436 --> 10:22.203
To save them?

10:22.204 --> 10:24.005
Choose your words wisely.

10:24.006 --> 10:26.940
We can't have anyone discovering
what it is we do.

10:32.980 --> 10:39.052
[Camera snapping]

10:53.734 --> 10:55.067
Mr. Reese,
I managed to get a read

10:55.068 --> 10:56.735
on that escrow account
that's funding HR.

10:56.736 --> 10:59.538
Question is who hired them?

10:59.539 --> 11:00.972
Impossible to determine.

11:00.973 --> 11:03.342
The money comes from dozens
of points of payment,

11:03.343 --> 11:04.710
multiple countries.

11:04.711 --> 11:07.846
The balance on the account
is $5,000,000.

11:07.847 --> 11:09.247
That's a hell of a payday.

11:09.248 --> 11:13.250
Someone with tremendous means
wants Caroline Turing gone.

11:13.251 --> 11:15.820
I've enlisted the aid
of an old friend to help us

11:15.821 --> 11:18.956
figure out who.

11:18.957 --> 11:23.728
She's cute.

11:23.729 --> 11:26.063
Hello, Zoe.

11:26.064 --> 11:27.531
Good to hear
you're getting some help,

11:27.532 --> 11:30.633
but I don't think
there's a woman out there alive

11:30.634 --> 11:32.201
that could fix you, John.

11:32.202 --> 11:36.939
Caroline Turing.
You familiar?

11:36.940 --> 11:40.343
No, but that's
obviously by design.

11:41.679 --> 11:45.381
Next to bartenders,
men usually like to spill it

11:45.382 --> 11:46.715
to female shrinks.

11:46.716 --> 11:48.950
It's easier than talking
to their wives.

11:48.951 --> 11:52.421
These men value discretion.

11:52.422 --> 11:53.856
You know any of her patients?
