WEBVTT

00:07.041 --> 00:09.341
- Art class? Yes!

00:10.411 --> 00:15.447
Sir Gareth, if you need
models, we're your guys.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.517
- We call this pose
"boys looking cool."

00:22.890 --> 00:25.557
- I call it
"stop acting the fool."

00:26.861 --> 00:30.429
- The sad part is they stayed
up all night practicing that.

00:32.333 --> 00:36.035
- These easels are for
the magical abilities test.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.338
It was developed after
the 100 Year Wizard Drought.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.640
- Oh, my grandparents
told me about that.

00:41.742 --> 00:45.644
In those days, magic markers
weren't just markers.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.281
- I bet I'm magical...

00:49.383 --> 00:51.617
since I already have
a magical smile.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.154
- You have spinach
in your teeth.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.221
- That's the magic.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.157
I did not eat spinach.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.360
- Allow me to introduce
you to the person

01:01.462 --> 01:03.929
who will be
giving the test...

01:04.031 --> 01:06.732
Sorceress Spitzalot.

01:11.072 --> 01:13.272
Thank you, Sir Gareth.

01:13.374 --> 01:18.177
I am so psyched to assess
such stellar students.

01:20.181 --> 01:23.215
- I think I know why
she's called Spitzalot.

01:23.317 --> 01:26.952
- If you are
one of the sublime students,

01:27.054 --> 01:29.421
who shows magical skill,

01:29.523 --> 01:32.324
you'll be sent away
from knight school

01:32.426 --> 01:37.362
to study at the Spitzalot
School of Sorcery.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.566
- Yes, I... I don't
want to lose any of you,

01:40.668 --> 01:43.202
but, unfortunately,
what she spits, goes.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.039
I shall now show you

01:47.141 --> 01:50.375
the spell you
all will attempt.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.849
Exevalo,
plucky plucky!

02:00.254 --> 02:01.854
Ohhh...

02:01.956 --> 02:03.255
- Oh, calm down.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.590
She picked a flower.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.225
I've punched a dragon.

02:10.163 --> 02:13.565
Reveltray,
putus backus.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.101
Ohhh...

02:16.203 --> 02:17.803
- Oh, look at that.
She reversed her spell.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.838
Which means she technically
accomplished nothing!

02:22.109 --> 02:24.076
To your easels.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.380
- Get ready to be amazed.

02:30.284 --> 02:33.418
Exevalo,
plucky plucky!

02:33.521 --> 02:34.486
Okay, no flower.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.589
But, look, now there's
broccoli in my teeth.

02:38.392 --> 02:41.560
- How does he do it?

02:41.662 --> 02:43.262
- Oh, Prudy,

02:43.364 --> 02:45.130
did you pull anything
out of the painting?

02:45.232 --> 02:47.366
- No. But I
did put something in it.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.103
- Oh, look, everyone,

02:51.205 --> 02:53.572
the girl giant
wrecked something.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.974
Shocker!

02:56.076 --> 02:57.576
- But she breaks
things all the time.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.979
Oh, you were doing that thing
where you sound nice,

03:01.081 --> 03:03.448
but you're being mean.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.519
- I guess it's my turn.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.756
Exevalo,
plucky plucky!

03:10.858 --> 03:15.460
Huh, it looks like I am meant
to save Astoria with my sword.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.298
By the way, has anyone
seen my sword?

03:21.402 --> 03:23.969
- Well, none of them
can do magic.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.905
I guess you won't plucky plucky
any of my students today.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.540
So long, Spitzy.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.476
So it seems, Sir Gareth.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.779
Guess I'll stick
around the castle

03:33.881 --> 03:36.281
and do some sightseeing.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.288
- Ahhhh!

03:43.390 --> 03:45.791
Close your mouth before
you tornado outta here.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.132

03:54.235 --> 03:56.335

04:00.107 --> 04:02.641
- I tried to do
this at home.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.409
A big mess.

04:07.648 --> 04:08.680
- Fave...

04:10.985 --> 04:12.217

04:12.319 --> 04:13.652
- Our favorite rock band
Don't Imagine Dragons

04:13.754 --> 04:16.321
for real is having a concert
in the courtyard tonight?

04:16.423 --> 04:18.857
Oh, please tell me
we have tickets.

04:18.959 --> 04:19.992
- We have tickets!

04:20.094 --> 04:21.994
- Sweet!

04:22.096 --> 04:23.495
- Oh, Prudyquake!

04:31.505 --> 04:33.605
- Oops.

04:33.707 --> 04:34.873
My bad.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.944
- Dang it, giant,
you noodled me.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.314
- I think you
look pretty.

04:44.218 --> 04:46.251
- I'm sorry, Sage.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.387
Sometimes I lose control
of my giant strength.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.689
- Yeah, well, someone
could have gotten hurt.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.593
See this is why giants
shouldn't go to knight school.

04:54.695 --> 04:59.231
- Well, they let you in and
you're a giant lunch bucket.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.667
- This isn't over.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.503
Buttercup!

05:04.605 --> 05:06.638
- You said it
wasn't over!

05:09.209 --> 05:11.743
- Don't worry about
what Sage said.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.078
- It's not just her.

05:13.180 --> 05:16.415
Everybody thinks that giants
are nothing but wrecking balls.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.517
I signed up for knight
school to prove them wrong.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.485
- That's what you
do every day.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.154
Except last Tuesday
when you tripped

05:22.256 --> 05:24.723
and knocked over
that barn.

05:24.825 --> 05:28.760
- I have to find a way to
control my giant strength.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.196
And I'm gonna do it...
starting now!

05:35.602 --> 05:37.069
- It was like that.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.941
- Oh, I'll steal
the ball from the knight.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.076
Time is running out.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.610
Arc shoots!

05:46.647 --> 05:49.081
And realizes foosball
is not his sport.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.457
- All right,
the coast is clear.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.791
I can try this now.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.693
Exevalo,
plucky plucky!

06:04.231 --> 06:06.331

06:45.906 --> 06:49.040

magic to wipe my memory?

06:49.143 --> 06:51.443
- Not if it didn't work.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.614
- Admit you can do magic
or say goodbye to this guy.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.149
- Why would I care
about that thing?

06:57.251 --> 06:58.850
Mr. Fuzzy Phoenix

07:04.792 --> 07:08.059

07:08.162 --> 07:09.194
- How?

07:09.296 --> 07:10.328
When? Who?

07:10.431 --> 07:12.097
No, I know that one.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.168
- When I was a kid, I messed
around with some spells,

07:16.270 --> 07:18.270
and realized
I can do magic.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.906
- Well, how did you fail
that spitty lady's test?

07:21.008 --> 07:22.808
- I tanked it on purpose.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.644
I don't want anyone
to find out.

07:25.746 --> 07:26.978
- Why not?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.313
- Well, you heard
Spitzalot.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.081
I'd get kicked
out of knight school.

07:30.184 --> 07:31.750
I can't let that happen.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.553
Being in the squad
is like my family.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.555
- Which makes me
Uncle Arcwick.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.961
- Just please
don't tell anyone.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.463
- Okay, as your
best friend,

07:44.565 --> 07:47.599
I promise not to tell anyone
about your magical secret.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.034
- Thank you.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.770
- But I will beg you to use
your magical secret for fun.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.205
- How?

07:53.307 --> 07:55.807
The only trick I can do is
taking stuff outta paintings.

07:55.909 --> 07:56.975
- Uh...

07:57.077 --> 07:58.677
how many paintings
in this castle

07:58.779 --> 08:01.079
do you think
have cake in them?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.284
- The answer is "a lot."

08:07.421 --> 08:09.654
Shoot, I shoulda grabbed
a painting with milk in it.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.156
- Oh, I might have you.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.928
You can milk
this, right?

08:23.270 --> 08:25.971

her bounce back.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.107

she's a ball.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.811
Prudy, what is this?

08:32.913 --> 08:35.580
- This is my stay out
of trouble bubble.

08:35.682 --> 08:36.982
Watch.

08:39.453 --> 08:41.720
See? The cart didn't go
flying out of the castle.

08:43.289 --> 08:44.789
My days of people
only seeing me

08:44.892 --> 08:47.392
as a giant who
destroys things are over.

08:47.494 --> 08:48.660
- This is crazy.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.730
And there is no way you can give
me a good hug in that thing.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.131
- That's not true.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.137
- Okay. Okay.
It is true.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.339
But my giant strength
is in check,

09:01.441 --> 09:03.508
and I can rock out at
the concert tonight.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.345

You can't live your
life in a bubble.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.616
- Uh, yes, I can.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.251
There's no rule
against it.

09:13.353 --> 09:16.855
- You're right, there
is no rule against it.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.523
- New rule:

09:18.625 --> 09:21.660
no person may live
their life in a bubble.

09:23.564 --> 09:27.299
- But, Your Majesty, why is
this all of a sudden a rule?

09:27.401 --> 09:30.068
Because, uh...

09:30.170 --> 09:33.471
- Because I am the king
and no takebacks.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.739
- Thank you, Daddy!

09:34.841 --> 09:39.044
- I believe I was promised
some of your famous s'mores.

09:39.146 --> 09:43.548
Oh, it is good
to be king.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.387
- Buttercup,
did you see that?

09:49.489 --> 09:52.991
- Yeah. I have
the same bubble in red.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.061
- No. Prudence
is desperate.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.897
This is our chance to
weaken Phoenix Squad

09:58.999 --> 10:00.632
and get revenge on
that giant girl.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.667
Come on.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.703
Prudence,
is everything okay?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.037
- Not now, Sage.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.106
The king just burst
my stay out of trouble bubble.

10:09.576 --> 10:12.177
- Maybe I can
help with that.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.980
- Wait. Why are
you being nice to me?

10:15.082 --> 10:16.514
- Oh, because this
is our chance to...

10:16.617 --> 10:21.953
- Show that we
understand how you feel.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.088
- You do?

10:23.190 --> 10:25.256
- We do?
- We do.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.792
It's hard being
different.

10:27.894 --> 10:31.096
I can't imagine being the only
giant in knight school.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.664
- Oh, it would be
so much easier,

10:32.766 --> 10:35.367
if I could just control
my giant strength.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.135
- I can't control
my giggling

10:37.237 --> 10:39.137
when I think about
baby pandas.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.473
I really cannot.

10:42.709 --> 10:47.412
- How about we talk about
your problem together?

10:47.514 --> 10:48.813
- I guess that
would be okay.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.048
I can't talk to Ciara.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.084
She doesn't even think
I have a problem.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.253

one giant problem.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.189
Let's get you
outta that suit.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.262
- Oh, I really thought
she was gonna go flying

my dessert cake yet.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.835
- We are disgusting.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.671
Let's go.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.510
- We can't go

11:52.612 --> 11:54.946
looking like Cake Man
and Frosting Boy.

11:55.048 --> 11:55.980
- Wait, which of us is...

11:56.083 --> 11:58.750

You're Frosting Boy.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.318
Obvi.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.022
- We should change,

12:04.124 --> 12:06.024
but we don't have
any party clothes here.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.127
Who's this sharply-
dressed hooligan?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.663
- Horvath the Horrible.
- Sounds cool.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.165
- No, he was horrible.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.768
He attacked the castle
with his lightning staff.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.471
Luckily, he was taken down
by the first knights of Astoria.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.239
- Aha, that's interesting.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.174
Let's take
Horvath's clothes.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.676
- No way.

12:24.778 --> 12:25.777
- Come on, dude.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.746
You've been taking stuff
out of paintings all day.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.780
- Yeah, food.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.149
Taking a scary villain's
clothes might be tricky.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.484
- Tricky?

12:32.586 --> 12:34.853
You already milked
a painting of a cow.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.423
- That milk
was delicious.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.359
All right,
but this is the last one.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.230
Exevalo,
plucky plucky!

12:47.901 --> 12:49.634
- I knew
you could do it.

12:49.736 --> 12:53.905
- Ugh, now Horvath's horrible
for a whole different reason.

12:55.575 --> 12:59.410
- Although, those heart
boxers do look like my size.

12:59.513 --> 13:00.612
- No!

13:02.048 --> 13:04.249
- Fine. Let's
go change.

13:05.685 --> 13:08.586
And you thought something
bad was gonna happen.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.189
I did. I really did.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.011

13:33.113 --> 13:34.345
Best rock band ever.

13:40.654 --> 13:43.521
- Dude, those pants.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.357
- Dude, that shirt.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.159
You look amazing.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.928
- No, you look amazing.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.396
- No, you do.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.499
Boy models forever!

13:57.070 --> 14:00.371
- Guys, I'm telling
you this as a friend.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.374
This has gotta stop.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.776
Have you guys
seen Prudy?

14:04.878 --> 14:07.245
I'm really worried
about her.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.914
- Well, I'm worried
about us.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.720
- Wha-a-a-a-at?

14:21.528 --> 14:22.694
- Is that Horvath
the Horrible

14:22.796 --> 14:24.929
from the painting
in our squad room?

14:25.031 --> 14:27.365
- How would we know?
We hate paintings.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.133
- And we certainly
don't eat them,

14:29.236 --> 14:31.402
if that's what
you're implying.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.504
- ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh ♪

14:33.607 --> 14:35.807
♪ Oh oh oh oh oh ♪

14:37.510 --> 14:39.377
- Guess he didn't
like that song.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.654
- How is this possible?

14:49.756 --> 14:51.389
- Maybe someone
used magic

14:51.491 --> 14:52.824
and let him out
of the painting

14:52.926 --> 14:56.494
because his best
friend talked him into it.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.030
- You two did this?

14:59.132 --> 15:01.633
Which means Warwick
can do magic.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.468
- How do you know
I'm not magical?

15:03.570 --> 15:05.503
- Because you'd
be bragging about it.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.740
- She got me there.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.718
- We need to get Horvath
back in the painting,

15:20.820 --> 15:22.587
so we need to
bring it down here.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.522
- Doesn't it weigh
like 500 pounds?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.658
- We need someone
super strong.

15:26.760 --> 15:30.695
- It sounds like
a job for Frosting Boy!

15:31.898 --> 15:35.667
- She already left
to go get Prudy.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.269
- She's way
stronger than you!

15:40.273 --> 15:42.473
- No need to be rude.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.521
- Have you guys
seen Prudence?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.957
- Oh, yeah, we've seen her.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.259
She was so upset that
you wouldn't help her

16:01.361 --> 16:05.463
with her giant strength
problem, so I helped her.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.165
- What did you do?

16:07.267 --> 16:09.968
- I met a beaver who tried
to get me to join the circus.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.938
- What did Sage do?

16:14.040 --> 16:16.808
- Oh, I just convinced
your giant friend

16:16.910 --> 16:19.944
that there's only one
solution to her problem.

16:20.046 --> 16:23.314
So, Prudence
quit knight school.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.682
- What?!

16:24.784 --> 16:25.750
- Maybe she
didn't hear you.

16:25.852 --> 16:26.985
- Prudence
quit knight school?

16:27.087 --> 16:28.753
- Oh, good.
She heard you.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.660
- Prudence?

16:35.762 --> 16:37.428
Prudence?

16:39.766 --> 16:42.166
My bestie's gone.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.702
Looks like I'm
gonna have to

16:44.804 --> 16:46.270
carry this painting
without her.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.108
Ohhhhhh!

16:55.315 --> 16:56.614
Almost got it!

16:56.716 --> 16:58.016
Oh!

17:01.354 --> 17:02.720
- What're you doin'?

17:02.822 --> 17:03.921
- Prudy!

17:04.023 --> 17:05.522
You're still here!

17:05.625 --> 17:07.858
- Yeah. I was
on my way out.

17:07.961 --> 17:10.661
Then I found some
cake in the bathroom.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.497
- You can't quit
knight school.

17:12.598 --> 17:13.964
- I have to.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.700
I mean, Sage is right.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.602
There's no way I'm ever
gonna be able to

17:17.704 --> 17:19.203
control my giant
strength.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.805
- Sage is wrong.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.507
So you break
stuff sometimes.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.809
You can also
do amazing things...

17:24.911 --> 17:26.978
things that no other
knight school student can do.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.746
- I am the only
one that can

17:28.848 --> 17:30.481
crack coconuts
under their armpits.

17:32.786 --> 17:34.018
- Exactly.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.087
Your giant strength
is what makes you special.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.222
And right now we need it
to stop Horvath the Horrible.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.825
- Ooh, the savage
villain from that painting?

17:40.927 --> 17:43.294
Oh! Who's no
longer there!

17:43.396 --> 17:47.098
- No, he's outside trying
to fry Arc and Warwick.

17:47.200 --> 17:47.999
- What?!

17:48.101 --> 17:50.168
Our friends
are in trouble?

17:52.238 --> 17:53.838
Ahhh!

17:53.940 --> 17:56.007
- Whoa, you were
all like...

17:59.679 --> 18:01.512
- Thanks.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.282
Where am I takin' this thing?
It's too heavy.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.694
- Why did we have
to eat 30 cakes?

18:22.902 --> 18:25.603
- Oh, that's
gotta hurt.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.205
- Yeah, it did.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.973
And it still does.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.509
- Okay,
the painting's here.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.579
- All right, Warwick, use
your magic to get him back in.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.647
- Yeah, about that.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.915
I'm not doing it.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.217
What?

18:39.319 --> 18:40.685
- If people see
me do magic,

18:40.787 --> 18:41.986
I'll have
to leave knight school.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.993
- There's not gonna
be a knight school,

18:49.095 --> 18:50.795
if you don't put him
back in the painting.

18:50.897 --> 18:51.963
- I don't want
you to leave,

18:52.065 --> 18:53.831
but I also don't want
the last thing I see

18:53.933 --> 18:55.299
to be that guy
in his underwear.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.237
- I'll never let
that happen to you, bro.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.005
I'll do it!

19:01.107 --> 19:03.040
- Prudy, you get
the painting behind Horvath

19:03.143 --> 19:04.575
and we'll figure
out the rest.

19:04.677 --> 19:05.743
- Got it.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.645
- Be ready with
the magic, Cake Man.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.580
- I'm always ready,
Frosting Boy.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.222
- Get him
to fire again!

19:18.324 --> 19:19.624
We'll use his
lightning against him.

19:19.726 --> 19:20.825
- Hey, hey, Horvath!

19:20.927 --> 19:22.426
You've been wearin'
the same underpants

19:22.529 --> 19:23.661
for a thousand years!

19:29.903 --> 19:30.835
- Warwick, now!

19:30.937 --> 19:32.603
Reveltray,
putus backus!

19:37.310 --> 19:39.644
- Warwick,
that was amazing.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.679
- Um, guys, we did it.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.847
- No, you did it.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.583
These fools let
him out of the painting.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.752
- And put him back.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.353
You're welcome.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.324
- And the best part
is no one saw me do magic.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.694
- Warwick, I...
I saw you do magic.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.665
- Or did you?

20:00.767 --> 20:02.633
Memory wipey wipey!

20:02.735 --> 20:05.803
- Yes, we all saw
you do magic.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.772
- Why don't it work?

20:07.874 --> 20:09.974
Because that's not the way

20:10.076 --> 20:12.710
you do the memory
wipe spell.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.978
But I'll teach you

20:14.080 --> 20:17.848
when you're transferred
to my school of sorcery.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.251
- Man, he's right
in the splash zone.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.089
- Sir Gareth, I don't
wanna go to sorcery school.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.325
I wanna stay in knight
school with my friends.

20:27.427 --> 20:31.229
- Warwick, I understand,
but it's not up to me.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.164
You leave for sorcery
school in the morning.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.199
- Why can't he be
a knight and do magic?

20:35.301 --> 20:37.501
He's going to sorcery school

20:37.604 --> 20:40.605
because that's
the rules.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.807
- Hmmm...

20:42.909 --> 20:44.976
rules, you say?

20:45.078 --> 20:46.944
- New rule:

20:47.046 --> 20:51.148
Warwick shall stay at
knight school and do magic.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.117
- But Your Majesty, why?

20:53.219 --> 20:55.253
- Because I'm the king
and I like s'mores!

21:00.293 --> 21:01.659
- You heard the man.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.128
I'm gonna be the first
magical knight, y'all.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.730
- We need to celebrate.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.132
To the cake museum!

21:08.234 --> 21:10.701
- Well, Spitzy,
you came for my students,

21:10.803 --> 21:12.603
but you leave
with this...

21:12.705 --> 21:14.639
pfffffft!

21:18.144 --> 21:20.645
- Thanks for convincing me
to stay in knight school.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.382
- See? I told you the hug's
better without the bubble.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.050
- Yeah.

21:26.152 --> 21:29.487
- Ugh, we get it.
You have feelings.

21:32.191 --> 21:35.026
- Ahem, excuse me,
Sorceress.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.194
My buddy Sage
actually wanted to know

21:37.297 --> 21:39.764
the history
of your school.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.365
- No, it's okay.
No, I don't.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.868
Oh, certainly.

21:43.970 --> 21:47.171
Since the inception
of sorcery,

21:47.273 --> 21:50.308
citizens of Astoria
have been astonished

21:50.410 --> 21:54.578
to see so many subjects
with sorcery powers.

21:54.681 --> 21:58.282
- Nice. You put her
right in the splash zone.
