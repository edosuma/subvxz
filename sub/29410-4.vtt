20:52.555 --> 20:53.469
It has to stop.

20:53.513 --> 20:54.992
This will destroy us.

20:55.036 --> 20:57.299
Sweetheart,
you don't understand.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.432
I don't want to understand.

20:59.475 --> 21:02.217
I have heard enough.
I have seen enough.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.263
It is time for you to understand

21:04.306 --> 21:06.787
that this has to stop.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.485
Before you ruin us.

21:15.883 --> 21:20.191
Don't you think
I would stop all this...

21:20.235 --> 21:21.367
if I could?

21:21.410 --> 21:23.978
Don't you think
I want to be the...

21:24.021 --> 21:26.197
perfect man,
the perfect husband?

21:26.937 --> 21:28.287
You're a monster.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.336
Jessica.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.254
Well, you may be right.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.083
But nobody has to know that.

21:42.126 --> 21:45.565
We can still keep our life,
Jess.

21:45.608 --> 21:48.437
Our perfect family.

21:48.481 --> 21:51.266
We don't have
to throw it all away.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.616
But I don't get
to make that decision.

21:56.967 --> 21:58.665
You do.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.463
[sighs]

22:20.904 --> 22:23.385
-[clattering]
-[cat yowling]

22:37.704 --> 22:39.575
-Hello, Roger.
-What the hell?!

22:39.619 --> 22:42.230
Cops can't s-sneak up
on people like that.

22:42.273 --> 22:43.318
Funny story.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.537
Technically, I'm a consultant.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.495
Well, at least
until my boss fires me,

22:46.539 --> 22:47.801
which, at this point,
seems inevitable.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.542
[breathes deeply]

22:49.585 --> 22:51.848
I need you to tell me
everything you know about Axel.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.807
You know I can't do that.

22:53.850 --> 22:57.288
The police won't press charges
as long as you tell the truth.

22:57.332 --> 22:59.160
You stole my camera.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.422
You manipulated me.

23:00.466 --> 23:03.120
Maybe I'm a freak to you,

23:03.164 --> 23:04.470
but I cared about Tatiana.

23:06.036 --> 23:08.082
Screw you.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.736
You're right.
I can see that now.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.999
You would never hurt her. But
I-I have to show you something.

23:12.042 --> 23:14.131
-A picture.
-What picture?

23:14.175 --> 23:17.004
The killer was facing Tatiana

23:17.047 --> 23:18.179
when he crushed her esophagus.

23:18.222 --> 23:20.486
That forced her eyes open.

23:20.529 --> 23:23.663
She had to look at him
while he strangled her to death.

23:23.706 --> 23:26.230
Who did this, Roger?

23:26.274 --> 23:28.885
Who killed her?

23:28.929 --> 23:30.670
I know what you're trying to do.

23:30.713 --> 23:32.149
It's not going to work.

23:32.193 --> 23:34.413
And you can rot in hell.

23:41.985 --> 23:43.204
Gil.

23:43.247 --> 23:44.553
I tried the photo.

23:44.597 --> 23:45.989
-[tires squealing]
-Roger still won't talk.

23:46.033 --> 23:47.600
[thud]

23:51.342 --> 23:53.649
Roger? Roger!

23:55.956 --> 23:58.306
Oh, my God.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.787
Gil, I need an ambulance.

24:00.830 --> 24:03.746
The corner of 52nd and 11th.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.487
Roger's been hit by a car.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.626
Coming through! Clear the hall!
Coming through!

24:13.669 --> 24:15.497
Corner!

24:16.933 --> 24:18.761
-DOCTOR: All right,
what do we have here?
-Hit-and-run.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.415
Possible dislocated shoulder,

24:20.459 --> 24:22.591
couple of broken ribs,
but vitals are within range.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.941
-Is he gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.334
He got lucky.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.512
Mind if I go talk to him?

24:30.556 --> 24:31.687
Sure.

24:33.733 --> 24:35.169
Roger.

24:35.212 --> 24:36.518
Roger, can you hear me?

24:36.562 --> 24:39.216
-Look, will you just...
-Hey.

24:39.260 --> 24:42.045
-Ow!
-Stay with me, man.

24:42.089 --> 24:43.743
What are you talking about?

24:43.786 --> 24:45.527
They're prepping
the OR right now.

24:45.571 --> 24:48.269
They can't...
they can't stop the bleeding.

24:48.312 --> 24:51.620
Not with the broken rib
piercing your stomach.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.709
What does that mean?

24:58.627 --> 25:00.542
[whispers]:
You're gonna die, Roger.

25:01.587 --> 25:02.979
Oh.

25:03.023 --> 25:05.634
No, I can't die.

25:06.679 --> 25:09.333
I got a cat.

25:09.377 --> 25:11.292
[exhales]

25:11.335 --> 25:13.163
There's only one thing
you can do.

25:13.207 --> 25:14.774
What?

25:15.818 --> 25:17.559
Do right by Tatiana.

25:17.603 --> 25:20.301
You loved her,
and she did not deserve this.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.390
No, she didn't.

25:22.433 --> 25:25.393
So tell me who did this.

25:25.436 --> 25:27.047
What do you know?

25:27.090 --> 25:28.614
I need to know the truth.

25:29.658 --> 25:32.531
Tatiana was leaving Axel
for another fashion line.

25:32.574 --> 25:36.186
It wasn't public yet,
but last week

25:36.230 --> 25:38.362
Axel flipped out on her.

25:38.406 --> 25:40.234
He hit her.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.630
The SD card is
in my inside jacket pocket.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.675
Please take it. Please.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.987
Hang in there, Rog.

25:54.030 --> 25:56.337
Wait.

25:59.035 --> 26:00.776
Watch my cat.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.345
Sure thing.

26:13.746 --> 26:15.748
[exhales]

26:16.923 --> 26:18.402
[sighs]

26:18.446 --> 26:20.404
-Luisa.
-Uh, nope.

26:20.448 --> 26:24.365
Just your daughter that you've
been avoiding like the plague,

26:24.408 --> 26:26.193
which, judging by the looks
of this place,

26:26.236 --> 26:27.716
you might actually have.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.762
What's going on?

26:31.067 --> 26:33.722
We had a fight.
[sighs]

26:33.766 --> 26:35.898
A truly epic fight.

26:35.942 --> 26:38.553
You should have never gone
to see him.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.685
No, not your father.

26:39.728 --> 26:40.816
Your brother and I.

26:40.860 --> 26:43.602
We had
a real knock-down-drag-out.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.778
This is about Malcolm.

26:46.779 --> 26:48.781
Course it is.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.872
It was biblical. Shakespearean.

26:52.915 --> 26:56.179
Someday Lin-Manuel Miranda
will rap about it.

26:56.223 --> 26:57.267
You're spiraling.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.529
Both of you.

26:58.573 --> 26:59.705
All because of Dad.

26:59.748 --> 27:01.097
You know, I'm...

27:01.141 --> 27:03.839
starting to think
I'm the only one in this family

27:03.883 --> 27:05.841
who could actually handle
visiting him.

27:05.885 --> 27:07.800
You don't mean that.

27:07.843 --> 27:08.888
Don't I?

27:08.931 --> 27:11.630
I'm the only one
without any baggage,

27:11.673 --> 27:12.892
and he could actually help me.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.545
Do you have any idea

27:14.589 --> 27:16.678
what a Martin Whitly exclusive
would do for my career?

27:16.722 --> 27:19.246
Give me my drink back.

27:19.289 --> 27:21.640
[sighs]

27:24.730 --> 27:28.559
Thanks to both of you,
he doesn't even know I exist.

27:29.343 --> 27:31.127
He knows all about you.

27:31.171 --> 27:32.825
Watches you every day.

27:32.868 --> 27:35.262
His daughter, the ace reporter.

27:35.305 --> 27:38.047
Martin Whitly
is your biggest fan.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.788
He is?

27:40.833 --> 27:42.573
[scoffs]

27:42.617 --> 27:44.750
Can we please talk
about something else?

27:44.793 --> 27:46.926
I am sick of me.

27:46.969 --> 27:48.797
Let's talk about you.

27:48.841 --> 27:51.713
No. Uh...

27:51.757 --> 27:54.716
I don't think I can.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.762
Goodbye.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.723
[sighs]

28:03.899 --> 28:07.207
Hospital says Roger is
in stable condition,

28:07.250 --> 28:08.599
no matter what Bright says.

28:08.643 --> 28:10.601
JT:
19th Precinct is investigating

28:10.645 --> 28:13.648
the hit-and-run.
No plates on the vehicle.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.042
Checking security and traffic
cams could take a while.

28:16.085 --> 28:19.262
Tatiana and Axel
got into it a few days ago.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.830
Roger got the play-by-play.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.745
JT:
That's no way to treat a lady.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.835
DANI:
That could be
pretty damning for Axel.

28:26.879 --> 28:28.489
[sighs]

28:28.532 --> 28:30.099
What about this?

28:30.143 --> 28:32.623
Aren't we still looking
for a stalker who knew

28:32.667 --> 28:34.756
how important the Blue Bath
campaign was to Tatiana?

28:34.800 --> 28:36.889
And Axel. Made him, too.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.979
You're right.

28:40.022 --> 28:41.545
I am?

28:41.589 --> 28:45.201
This killer isn't obsessed
with Tatiana.

28:45.245 --> 28:46.986
They're obsessed with Axel.

28:47.029 --> 28:49.597
We're looking
for Axel's stalker?

28:49.640 --> 28:52.252
Yes. Killing the ex
who broke his heart.

28:52.295 --> 28:54.994
Running down the photographer
who knew too much.

28:55.037 --> 28:58.214
This killer
is trying to please Axel.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.520
GIL:
Makes sense.

28:59.563 --> 29:00.782
Jackie and I
used to have this cat

29:00.826 --> 29:02.915
who'd leave dead mice
on our doorstep

29:02.958 --> 29:04.568
every morning,
like she was leaving us gifts.

29:04.612 --> 29:06.962
Yes. The perfect metaphor.

29:07.006 --> 29:08.355
And one creepy-ass cat.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.966
BRIGHT:
This killer wants credit,

29:11.010 --> 29:12.620
like Gil's cat.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.709
These murders are gifts.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.538
That's why the Blue Bath
scared Axel.

29:17.581 --> 29:19.496
He knows who the killer is.

29:19.540 --> 29:21.020
How can you be so sure?

29:22.543 --> 29:23.892
Oh, my love.

29:23.936 --> 29:26.939
You have no idea
what your father is capable of.

29:26.982 --> 29:28.767
Family always knows.

29:29.593 --> 29:31.639
It's someone from his entourage.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.772
JT:
We got a problem.

29:33.815 --> 29:36.687
Axel's having a launch party
for his new line tonight

29:36.731 --> 29:38.037
and then hops on a plane
to Europe.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.908
DANI:
Probably with his whole crew.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.910
-Then let's go to the party.
-GIL: Hold on, Bright.

29:41.954 --> 29:44.130
We can't just go in there
and flash badges.

29:44.173 --> 29:45.435
They don't have to answer
our questions.

29:45.479 --> 29:46.828
We have to have a warrant.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.612
-There's not enough time, boss.
-I just need

29:48.656 --> 29:50.266
five minutes with Axel alone.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.965
Stalker psychology
causes compulsive behavior.

29:53.008 --> 29:56.011
Hard to resist,
nearly impossible to hide.

29:56.055 --> 29:57.578
I can do this.

29:58.535 --> 30:00.842
Bright, we're cops,

30:00.886 --> 30:03.671
and we do it the right way
or not at all.

30:03.714 --> 30:05.281
Nobody goes near that event,

30:05.325 --> 30:08.850

30:32.004 --> 30:34.963
In an epic flame war with Mom.
Yeah, I know.

God, listen, I don't know
what she's told you, but...

30:37.052 --> 30:39.881
Bro, for once, I don't want
to get in between you guys.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.970
I want to talk about Dad.

30:42.014 --> 30:45.060
-Does he really watch
my reports?
-Yeah.

30:45.104 --> 30:48.455
He's been, uh, tracking
all the murders in the city.

30:48.498 --> 30:49.935
He wants us to team up.

30:49.978 --> 30:52.198
So he's watching me for you.

30:52.241 --> 30:53.416
No, I didn't say that.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.418
The Surgeon's a perfectionist.

30:55.462 --> 30:56.855
He wouldn't be watching you

30:56.898 --> 30:59.205
unless you were
the best reporter in town.

30:59.248 --> 31:01.903
Why are you asking?

31:01.947 --> 31:03.949
I think I'm gonna interview him.

31:04.775 --> 31:05.951
That's a truly terrible idea.

31:05.994 --> 31:07.430
It's really not.

31:07.474 --> 31:09.389
They've been kicking back
all of my pitches at work,

31:09.432 --> 31:12.087
and this would really get me
in the inner circle.

31:12.131 --> 31:13.132
At what expense?

31:14.350 --> 31:16.526
So you don't think
I should do it?

31:21.488 --> 31:22.924
JOEY:
Yo, who is this,

31:22.968 --> 31:24.099
acting like Axel's a suspect?

31:26.580 --> 31:27.973
Ainsley, sorry. I got to go.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.191
I got an after-hours thing.

31:29.235 --> 31:31.019
What?

31:34.718 --> 31:36.459
BRIGHT:
Hey, Axel.

31:36.503 --> 31:39.810
Uh... excuse me.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.552
Hey, hey,
what are you doing here?

31:42.596 --> 31:44.163
There's been another attack.

31:44.206 --> 31:45.294
You have a stalker.

31:45.338 --> 31:47.557
One who's willing to kill.
