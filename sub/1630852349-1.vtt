[cheering and applause]

00:31.800 --> 00:33.040
Hello.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.120
[laughter]

00:36.240 --> 00:40.720
This is my first special since 2017.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.240
[cheering and whooping]

00:44.520 --> 00:46.520
The world was different back then.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.120
Corona was a beer.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.040
[laughter]

00:52.120 --> 00:53.920
Harry was a prince.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
[laughter]

01:00.160 --> 01:03.120
Nobody was singing
about having a wet-ass pussy.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.640
[laughter]

01:06.960 --> 01:08.120
I love that song.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.160
I love it.
It was the biggest-selling record

01:12.240 --> 01:14.480
during a global pandemic.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.160
[laughter]

01:16.240 --> 01:17.920
How confused

01:18.000 --> 01:20.120
are future generations gonna be?

01:20.200 --> 01:21.560
[laughter]

01:21.640 --> 01:25.000
'Cause think about it.
The bubonic plague, what was the song?

01:25.080 --> 01:27.480
"A tissue. A tissue."

01:28.280 --> 01:29.840
"We all fall down."

01:30.480 --> 01:33.240
COVID? "Spit in my mouth, look in my eye."

01:33.320 --> 01:35.840
"This pussy wet, come take a dive."

01:35.920 --> 01:39.000
[laughter and applause]

01:43.120 --> 01:46.760
They're gonna be baffled.
"Hang on, so people were dying?"

01:46.840 --> 01:49.960
"And you were singing
about having drizzly growlers?"

01:50.920 --> 01:51.920
That's right.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.200
Any other questions?
"Yeah, who's Carole Baskin?"

01:55.280 --> 01:57.840
-Well…
-[laughter]

01:57.920 --> 01:59.240
That's complicated.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.880
"What's an anti-vaxxer?"

02:01.960 --> 02:05.280
That's the name
we gave to all the people that died.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.080
[laughter]

02:07.160 --> 02:10.200
[cheering]

02:15.080 --> 02:16.560
That will split a crowd.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.360
Between fans of science and Facebook.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.760
[laughter]

02:21.840 --> 02:24.760
"I believe in God over the vaccines"
That's handy.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.440
You're about to meet him, you thick fuck.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.280
[laughter]

02:29.520 --> 02:30.880
It's exhausting, innit?

02:31.400 --> 02:34.640
So many anti-vaxxers in this country.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.400
Most of them are my cousins.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.240
[laughter]

02:38.320 --> 02:40.760
"I'm not sure about the vaccine."

02:40.840 --> 02:43.200
You took ketamine at my wedding!

02:43.280 --> 02:44.480
[laughter]

02:49.920 --> 02:51.920
"Bill Gates wants to read my mind!"

02:52.000 --> 02:54.480
You've got no GCSEs!

02:54.560 --> 02:56.240
[laughter]

02:58.080 --> 03:01.520
My auntie's against it.
"It's full of chemicals." So's your face!

03:01.600 --> 03:02.800
[laughter]

03:02.880 --> 03:04.960
She's had so much Botox
every time she winks,

03:05.040 --> 03:06.320
her leg goes like this.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.400
[laughter]

03:10.160 --> 03:12.840
Why would you believe
what you read on Facebook?

03:12.920 --> 03:16.760
Facebook is a kaleidoscope
of mania and bullshit.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.600
There was an article
I saw the other day that said,

03:19.680 --> 03:23.040
"Are hackers secretly controlling

03:23.120 --> 03:24.960
our hot tubs?"

03:25.040 --> 03:27.440
[laughter]

03:27.520 --> 03:29.040
No one's worried about that.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.480
Even the poshest couple here.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.120
"I can't sleep, Roger."

03:35.040 --> 03:36.200
"It's the Jacuzzi."

03:36.280 --> 03:37.760
[laughter]

03:39.240 --> 03:40.520
"We're being hacked."

03:41.640 --> 03:43.280
"It's the fucking Russians, Rog."

03:43.360 --> 03:45.160
[laughter]

03:45.240 --> 03:49.280
Like there's an operative in Moscow.
"Shall we destabilize their economy?"

03:49.360 --> 03:50.520
"No."

03:51.600 --> 03:55.800
"Let's make the outside bath
less bubbly than they desire."

03:55.880 --> 03:57.880
[laughter]

03:59.040 --> 04:02.200
[cheering and applause]

04:06.120 --> 04:08.360
So funny, man. This article went on.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.240
Apparently, hackers can also…

04:11.040 --> 04:13.520
They can also control your fridge,

04:13.600 --> 04:15.480
your telly, and my favorite,

04:15.560 --> 04:16.800
your sex toy.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.240
[laughter]

04:18.320 --> 04:20.440
It's unlikely, innit? Even if they could,

04:20.520 --> 04:23.360
what's the worst that'll happen?
You'll have a lovely orgasm.

04:23.440 --> 04:24.880
[laughter]

04:24.960 --> 04:27.600
That's a great excuse.
Let's not muck around.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.800
"I can't stop it, Brian!
It's Vladimir Putin!"

04:29.880 --> 04:31.880
[laughter]

04:34.200 --> 04:36.880
[applause]

04:40.480 --> 04:42.760
"Five times he's had me doing it today!"

04:42.840 --> 04:45.480
"The KGB bastards!"

04:45.560 --> 04:47.320
"Fetch a bucket and a mop!"

04:47.400 --> 04:51.640
The point I'm making,
that's the worst that's gonna happen.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.680
It's not like remote-controlled sex toys
will be leaping out of cupboards,

04:55.760 --> 04:57.760
chasing men down the high street.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.400
"Leg it! It's got multiple speeds!'

05:00.480 --> 05:02.920
You're not gonna
switch on the BBC tonight,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.320
"Five more people were today

05:05.400 --> 05:06.720
dildoed to death."

05:06.800 --> 05:09.000
[laughter]

05:09.080 --> 05:13.400
"The footage is far too shocking,
but we do have their final words."

05:13.480 --> 05:15.040
"Oh yeah!"

05:15.120 --> 05:16.880
[laughter]

05:16.960 --> 05:19.200
"Oh fuck yeah!"

05:20.120 --> 05:23.600
"Help me, Brian!
My fanny hammer's gone loco!"

05:23.680 --> 05:25.160
[laughter]

05:25.240 --> 05:26.960
"Here's Jenny with the weather--"

05:27.040 --> 05:29.960
-"Save yourselves!"
-[laughter]

05:31.680 --> 05:34.160
When did we become so anti-science?

05:35.040 --> 05:36.760
I would get it if it was the ’90s.

05:36.840 --> 05:39.000
They used to put ears on the back of mice.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.000
Do you remember that mouse?

05:41.080 --> 05:42.240
Freaked me out as a kid.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.320
I imagined him in a cage with the others.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.080
"Bloody hell."

05:46.160 --> 05:47.160
[laughter]

05:47.240 --> 05:48.960
"See what they've done to Derek?"

05:49.040 --> 05:50.960
[laughter]

05:51.040 --> 05:52.600
"You don't need to whisper."

05:53.120 --> 05:55.280
[laughter]

05:57.640 --> 06:00.640
"Fucking walking around
like Van Gogh's backpack over here."

06:00.720 --> 06:02.560
[laughter]

06:04.400 --> 06:06.440
All these conspiracy theories, man.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.240
Everyone's trying to
make sense of the world,

06:08.320 --> 06:10.800
but some things don't make sense.

06:11.440 --> 06:12.400
Rubber ducks.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.200
[laughter]

06:14.280 --> 06:16.560
The spelling of the name "Siobhan."

06:16.640 --> 06:18.800
[laughter]

06:20.320 --> 06:24.160
Why do human beings blame
our weird behavior on animals?

06:24.240 --> 06:25.600
You know the phrase "catfish"?

06:25.680 --> 06:28.000
Someone goes online,
pretends to be someone else?

06:28.080 --> 06:29.480
Catfish don't do that.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.040
They're not in the sea,
"Show us your tits. I'm a dolphin."

06:33.120 --> 06:35.040
[laughter]

06:37.400 --> 06:40.000
[applause]

06:41.880 --> 06:44.560
"I'm not really a catfish.
I've seen your minge."

06:44.640 --> 06:47.320
They're not doing that. There's millions.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.000
Have you ever seen a wolf whistle?

06:50.080 --> 06:52.080
[laughter]

06:52.160 --> 06:53.920
Ever seen a badger badger?

06:54.840 --> 06:56.840
Have you ever seen
an elephant in a room go,

06:56.920 --> 06:58.360
"I know."

06:58.440 --> 07:00.440
[laughter]

07:02.680 --> 07:04.920
-Have you ever seen… yeah, exactly.
-[whistling]

07:05.720 --> 07:07.400
Ever seen a rat snitch?

07:07.480 --> 07:09.040
Ever seen a donkey punch?

07:09.120 --> 07:11.440
Cold turkey. "You look freezing!"

07:11.520 --> 07:13.200
"I've quit heroin!"

07:13.280 --> 07:14.760
[laughter]

07:16.520 --> 07:18.880
So many things don't make sense.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.880
Look at British politics.

07:20.960 --> 07:24.640
Wow. That is proof
that the cream can rise to the top,

07:24.720 --> 07:27.160
but turds can float there too.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.080
[laughter]

07:29.160 --> 07:32.240
[cheering and applause]

07:38.080 --> 07:39.960
Look at Boris Johnson.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.920
[laughter]

07:42.000 --> 07:44.800
Just saying his name
was enough to make you laugh.

07:44.880 --> 07:45.760
[laughter]

07:45.840 --> 07:49.760
We never know what he's gonna say.
His brain's like Cards Against Humanity.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.720
[laughter]

07:53.400 --> 07:56.960
Ironically, he sounds like
he's got a sex toy in him, doesn't he?

07:57.560 --> 07:58.800
"Hello, Britain…"

07:58.880 --> 08:01.800
-[speech like electronic humming]
-[laughter]

08:05.040 --> 08:06.240
It's insane!

08:06.320 --> 08:08.720
All the way through a pandemic,
all he said to us was,

08:08.800 --> 08:10.720
"Hands. Face. Space."

08:10.800 --> 08:11.680
[laughter]

08:11.760 --> 08:13.200
"Right. See you next week."

08:13.280 --> 08:15.160
[laughter]

08:15.240 --> 08:18.040
Like a cuckoo clock.
"Hello, everybody. Me again."

08:18.120 --> 08:20.560
"Hands. Face. Space."

08:21.560 --> 08:23.560
[laughter]

08:24.240 --> 08:26.120
It's like an Etonian Yoda.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.680
[laughter]

08:27.760 --> 08:30.560
It was a slogan. Slogans don't work.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.800
We're British.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.040
What do we do with slogans? Ignore them.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.360
Every beer in this country.
"Drink responsibly."

08:38.440 --> 08:39.760
[laughter]

08:39.840 --> 08:40.880
Exactly.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.800
[cheering and applause]

08:43.880 --> 08:47.200
Nobody in this country

08:47.280 --> 08:49.480
drinks responsibly.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.040
Weekends in this land

08:51.120 --> 08:54.040
are like the fucking Purge. Just…

08:54.120 --> 08:56.600
[imitating hunting horn]

08:56.680 --> 08:59.640
"You have two days to live, England.
Kill or be killed!"

08:59.720 --> 09:01.520
[imitating hunting horn]

09:02.520 --> 09:03.800
We get so hammered,

09:03.880 --> 09:06.720
we look like
those things you see outside garages.

09:06.800 --> 09:07.840
You know, those…

09:08.560 --> 09:11.320
[laughter]

09:16.440 --> 09:18.920
[cheering and applause]

09:23.840 --> 09:27.880
You don't realize how hopeless Boris is
until you see other leaders.

09:27.960 --> 09:30.600
I was in Denmark when COVID kicked off.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.040
Their leader was a woman. She was amazing.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.000
She looked… I'll never forget it.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.080
I was doing a show in Denmark,
and my mom was like,

09:37.160 --> 09:39.600
"Ooh! Are you doing it in English?"

09:40.240 --> 09:41.480
[laughter]

09:41.560 --> 09:42.720
"Probably."

09:42.800 --> 09:44.720
[laughter]

09:48.840 --> 09:52.200
But the Danish female leader
stood in front of the nation and went,

09:52.280 --> 09:55.320
"This is serious. We are locking down."

09:55.400 --> 09:58.840
Do you know what Boris did the same day?
I do, 'cause I watched him.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.000
"Hello."

10:00.080 --> 10:01.760
[laughter]

10:01.840 --> 10:04.040
"We're gonna have to wash our hands."

10:04.120 --> 10:06.120
-[Russell laughing]
-[audience laughing]

10:07.640 --> 10:08.560
He's like…

10:08.640 --> 10:11.120
[cheering and applause]

10:15.600 --> 10:18.000
"We're gonna have to wash our hands."
Remember that moment?

10:18.520 --> 10:20.840
"Now, we need to wash
our hands for 20 seconds."

10:21.400 --> 10:23.400
"The way I like to remember 20

10:24.240 --> 10:26.480
is by singing 'Happy Birthday' to myself."

10:26.560 --> 10:27.480
[laughter]

10:27.560 --> 10:30.080
Our leader gave us that advice.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.600
I was like, "How thick do you think
we are? We can't count to 20?"

10:34.680 --> 10:36.160
[laughter]

10:36.240 --> 10:39.520
Yet an hour later,
I was in a toilet in Copenhagen,

10:39.600 --> 10:45.160
♪ Happy birthday to me ♪

10:46.800 --> 10:48.160
I thought I was alone.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.600
Have you ever had a moment like that?

10:52.120 --> 10:56.160
The look of confusion.
This poor Danish man saw me doing that,

10:56.240 --> 10:58.240
and just went, "Happy birthday."

10:58.320 --> 11:00.640
[laughter]

11:02.080 --> 11:04.400
[cheering and applause]

11:09.440 --> 11:10.840
Talking of female leaders,

11:10.920 --> 11:14.640
apparently, the countries run by women
did better in the pandemic

11:14.720 --> 11:16.080
than the ones run by blokes.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.280
[whooping and cheering]

11:21.320 --> 11:22.960
Makes total sense to me.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.240
Women are resilient.
Compassionate. Unfazed.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.560
[whooping and cheering]

11:31.040 --> 11:33.760
You bleed out yourselves once a month.
You're not bothered.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.200
[laughter]

11:35.280 --> 11:37.320
I've seen the adverts.
You're out roller-skating.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.840
[laughter]

11:39.920 --> 11:42.320
My dad has a sit-down after a sandwich.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.160
[laughter]

11:44.920 --> 11:48.320
If men had periods,
there'd be no activities in our ads.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.800
There wouldn't. We'd be watching
the telly, crying, going, "It's broke."

11:52.880 --> 11:55.320

12:01.440 --> 12:03.720
-Look what she did in New Zealand.
-[cheering]

12:03.800 --> 12:05.040
It was incredible, wasn't it?

12:05.120 --> 12:07.960
She pretty much mummed an entire nation.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.480
"Look at me. I'm your mom, okay?"

12:11.000 --> 12:13.760
"We're going to lock down
until the disease goes away."

12:13.840 --> 12:15.640
"We're going to use mom logic."

12:15.720 --> 12:17.080
"Why don't we drink bleach?"

12:17.160 --> 12:18.560
"Don't listen to your dad."

12:18.640 --> 12:20.760
[laughter]

12:24.720 --> 12:26.360
That's what moms do, innit?

12:27.400 --> 12:30.240
Moms are wildly overprotective.
That's what they do.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.640
Remember when your mom
warned you about things

12:32.720 --> 12:35.320
you hadn't considered?
You're minding your own business,

12:35.400 --> 12:36.360
your mom appears,

12:36.440 --> 12:38.680
"Don't run with scissors."

12:38.760 --> 12:40.760
[laughter]

12:42.360 --> 12:43.480
"Cheers, Mom."

12:45.280 --> 12:46.720
"I wasn't planning on it."

12:47.840 --> 12:50.000
"Don't put a knife in a plug socket."

12:50.720 --> 12:51.640
"Again…"

12:51.720 --> 12:53.440
[laughter]

12:53.520 --> 12:54.920
"…not on my to-do list."

12:56.240 --> 12:57.280
This was the weirdest.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.720
Remember being eight, and your mom's like,
"Don't put two pencils up your nose

13:01.640 --> 13:03.680
and smash your head on a desk."

13:03.760 --> 13:05.320
[laughter]

13:09.920 --> 13:11.880
"Thank God you're here, Mom."

13:12.440 --> 13:16.640
"We were literally
about to play Suicide Walrus."

13:16.720 --> 13:18.560
[laughter]

13:21.160 --> 13:22.960
It might be different in your family.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.080
Your dad might be good in a crisis.
Mine's hopeless.

13:26.160 --> 13:30.720
When I was nine and my brother and sister
were seven, our rabbit twitched once.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.600
Dad killed it
in front of us with a hammer.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.720
[laughter]

13:34.800 --> 13:35.640
"Watch out!"

13:35.720 --> 13:39.760
[thumping]

13:40.440 --> 13:42.440
"I don't like watching 'em suffer, kids."

13:42.520 --> 13:44.920
[laughter]

13:45.000 --> 13:48.120
Even age nine,
I'm like, "I don't know, Dad."

13:48.200 --> 13:50.080
[applause]

13:53.480 --> 13:56.400
"Probably a better way
of dealing with myxomatosis than that."

13:56.480 --> 13:59.000
"Maybe clear the perimeter first

13:59.080 --> 14:03.520
before you pancake Flopsy,
you fucking maniac."

14:03.600 --> 14:06.560
I will never forget it.
My sister's crying.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.000
My brother's laughing.

14:09.240 --> 14:12.280
My mom's like, "Come on.
Your dad's having one of his moments."

14:13.960 --> 14:16.080
"Don't pull a face. The wind'll change

14:16.160 --> 14:17.760
and it'll stay that way."

14:19.320 --> 14:21.640
Now I'm gonna do a joke
that you're not gonna like.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.280
-[woman whoops]
-You say that, madam.

14:25.640 --> 14:26.720
But buckle up.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.520
[laughter]

14:28.600 --> 14:30.280
I'll bet you money it was a dad

14:30.360 --> 14:32.640
that let those kids
go round Michael Jackson's.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.440
[groaning and laughter]

14:34.520 --> 14:37.840

14:40.840 --> 14:43.320
You know I'm right. You know I'm right.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.720
My dad would've sanctioned that.
"Yeah. He looks all right. Fuck it."

14:46.800 --> 14:48.280
[laughter]

14:48.360 --> 14:50.400
There's no way
my mom would have allowed that.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.120
"You're not going round his house." "Why?"

14:52.200 --> 14:54.520
"I'll give you two reasons.
His best friend's a monkey,

14:54.600 --> 14:56.360
and there's a theme park in his garden."

14:56.440 --> 14:58.040
[laughter]

14:58.120 --> 15:00.480
"Call me wacky. It smells like bait."

15:02.080 --> 15:04.120
"Besides, love, you're a mouth breather."

15:04.200 --> 15:06.640
"It'd be in your gob
before you can say 'Billie Jean.'"

15:07.160 --> 15:08.000
"Come along."

15:08.080 --> 15:10.600
[laughter and scattered applause]

15:11.840 --> 15:16.080
I'm trying to say, it didn't surprise me
that female leaders excelled.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.640
You know what I find baffling?

15:17.720 --> 15:22.280
Why is it women are treated
like morons by British newspapers?

15:22.360 --> 15:23.880
It's extraordinary. There was an art--

15:23.960 --> 15:25.800
-[cheering]
-Yeah.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.800
We had a heat wave
this summer. 31 degrees.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.040
That's so hot,
apparently it made Prince Andrew sweat.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.240
[laughter]

15:37.480 --> 15:40.320
[cheering and applause]

15:44.040 --> 15:46.880
There was an article
offering women advice.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.120
Was it to use suntan lotion?

15:49.200 --> 15:50.520
Was it to wear a cap?

15:50.600 --> 15:54.600
Nope. It was not to put ice lollies

15:54.680 --> 15:56.040
up their

15:56.120 --> 15:57.400
vaginas.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.560
[laughter]

15:59.640 --> 16:02.920
Now, I don't want to speak
on behalf of the sisters…

16:03.000 --> 16:04.680
[laughter]

16:04.760 --> 16:07.200
…but I'm guessing
that's an unnecessary tip.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.760
[laughter]

16:08.840 --> 16:10.760
I've seen my grandmother in a heat wave.

16:10.840 --> 16:14.120
Not once, "Get me a Calippo,
Russ, I'm burning up here."

16:14.200 --> 16:16.360
[laughter]

16:16.440 --> 16:19.720

an ice-cream van fanny-first.

16:24.720 --> 16:25.720

16:25.800 --> 16:29.480
Not one woman in London

16:30.160 --> 16:32.040
You wouldn't do that,
'cause you're not mad.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.280
Same way as if it was snowing,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.440
you wouldn't put
a panini up your arsehole.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.800

You won't. You'll feel like a chicken.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.480

16:56.560 --> 16:58.320
It must be exhausting. Young women,

all these celebrities
trying to profit off your bodies, man.

17:01.880 --> 17:05.040
There's a pill
doing the rounds on Instagram,

17:05.120 --> 17:08.960
where you take the pill
and it makes your genitals taste peachy.

17:09.040 --> 17:09.880

17:10.640 --> 17:13.400
I can't speak for the London lesbians.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.480
Exactly.

18:33.040 --> 18:36.400
Don't let celebrities
make you feel otherwise.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.960

it's not an acquired taste.

you develop quite a hankering.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.200
[laughter]

19:04.280 --> 19:07.200
Initially, you're licking timidly,
like a deer by a river.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.280

19:12.800 --> 19:15.720

22:50.320 --> 22:53.480
"Put that on Leicester City
winning the Premier League,

22:54.200 --> 22:56.400
and in February 2020,

22:56.480 --> 22:59.280
you need to build a wall around Wuhan."

22:59.360 --> 23:01.200
[laughter]

23:01.280 --> 23:04.000
"Wuhan. Write it down."

23:04.080 --> 23:06.400
[cheering and applause]

23:08.920 --> 23:12.440
"I'm busy.
I'm writing a letter to Jimmy Savile."

23:13.240 --> 23:14.160
"Burn it."

23:14.240 --> 23:16.280
[laughter]

23:18.400 --> 23:21.240
[applause and whistling]

23:26.760 --> 23:29.240
The problem with this, right?
I've figured something out.

23:29.320 --> 23:33.520
If you absorb the world through
social media, you lose your faith in it.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.720
You think everything's awful,
and that's so wrong.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.480
'Cause the world's magnificent.

23:38.560 --> 23:41.800
We've got scientists that are
making hearing aids for babies.

23:41.880 --> 23:45.840
We've got young carers,
we got nurses, doctors and firefighters.

23:45.920 --> 23:49.200
I met a dog
that looks after a woman with diabetes.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.120
That's how wonderful this world is.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.760
-I didn't know this.
-[whooping]

23:52.840 --> 23:55.640
I did not know this,
but apparently in this country,

23:55.720 --> 23:57.160
if you've got diabetes,

23:57.240 --> 23:58.760
you can be given a dog.

23:58.840 --> 24:01.120
And that dog will look after you.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.520
It will smell
when your blood sugar is low and warn you.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.240
What a wonderful thing. It's so lovely.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.560
[cheering and applause]

24:08.640 --> 24:09.480
It's just…

24:12.840 --> 24:14.240
Warms your soul.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.440
I had a lovely image
of a dog sat next to a little old lady.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.560
They're both watching the TV,
and the dog's like,

24:19.640 --> 24:20.640
[sniffing]

24:20.720 --> 24:21.720
"Maureen."

24:21.800 --> 24:23.200
[laughter]

24:23.280 --> 24:24.160
"Have a biscuit."

24:24.240 --> 24:26.480
[laughter]

24:29.440 --> 24:32.200
"I really love you, darling,
but it's really coming off you tonight."

24:32.280 --> 24:34.440
[laughter]

24:35.160 --> 24:37.200
"I'm not smiling.
I'm breathing through my teeth."

24:37.280 --> 24:39.000
[laughter]

24:40.160 --> 24:43.680
"Eat your biscuits. Seriously,
if I was a cat, you'd be dead in a week."

24:43.760 --> 24:45.200
[laughter]

24:45.280 --> 24:46.720
"But I'm not. I'm a dog."

24:47.320 --> 24:48.280
"And I love ya."

24:49.240 --> 24:52.480
"This pandemic's been brutal.
The inertia, the sludge."

24:52.560 --> 24:54.320
"The tyranny placed upon us."

24:54.400 --> 24:57.000
"But it would have been impossible
without you."

24:57.760 --> 24:59.760
"You're not an owner. You're a friend."

25:00.400 --> 25:01.600
"Now eat your biscuit."

25:01.680 --> 25:03.400
[laughter]

25:03.480 --> 25:05.920
"'Cause when I wake up tomorrow,
I want to see you,

25:06.000 --> 25:07.880
and I want to go for a lovely walk."

25:07.960 --> 25:09.280
[laughter]

25:09.360 --> 25:10.440
[sniffing]

25:10.520 --> 25:11.720
"That's better."

25:12.960 --> 25:13.800
[sniffing]

25:13.880 --> 25:16.120
"Peach? Jesus, Maureen!"

25:16.200 --> 25:18.880
[laughter and applause]

25:22.160 --> 25:24.160
It's nice to hear laughter, man.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.760
I'm not blowing smoke up your arse.
You're an amazing crowd.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.520
-[whooping]
-Because… it's true.

25:32.040 --> 25:35.000
It's funny,
'cause not everyone's keen on laughter.

25:35.880 --> 25:38.760
The professionally upset
have started coming.

25:38.840 --> 25:40.480
[laughter]

25:41.120 --> 25:43.200
I was taking the piss out of my wonky eye

25:43.280 --> 25:46.080
at a gig in Cambridge.
There was like 3,000 people there.

25:46.160 --> 25:48.440
This bloke went, "I don't like it."

25:48.520 --> 25:50.400
[laughter]

25:50.480 --> 25:53.400
"I don't like it
when you joke about your eye

25:53.480 --> 25:56.480
because I have got a lazy eye."

25:56.560 --> 25:58.320
[laughter]

25:58.400 --> 26:01.000
"Surely if anyone can,
you can look the other way."

26:01.080 --> 26:02.400
[laughter]

26:02.480 --> 26:04.800
[cheering and applause]

26:11.240 --> 26:12.520
He disagreed.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.680
Physically and metaphorically,

26:16.440 --> 26:17.680
we couldn't see eye to eye.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.680
[laughter]

26:21.240 --> 26:22.480
[woman whooping]

26:22.560 --> 26:25.200
Such a weird thing.
I think wonky eyes are funny, man.

26:25.280 --> 26:28.160
Mine's lazy. You should see my cousin's.
His is unemployed.

26:28.240 --> 26:29.400
[laughter]

26:29.480 --> 26:32.680
Have to approach each other
sideways-on, like crabs.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.920
We can't lose
our ability to laugh at ourselves.

26:38.520 --> 26:39.440
It's weird.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.680
These are the rules in England.
We're ugly and funny.

26:42.760 --> 26:43.960
[laughter]

26:44.040 --> 26:44.920
Yeah.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.800
I'm not sure if you've been to Sweden.
Not a lot of banter.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.080
[laughter]

26:50.160 --> 26:51.200
They don't need it.

26:51.280 --> 26:54.000
"Look at my cheekbones."
"I agree. Let's get married."

26:54.080 --> 26:55.920
[laughter]

26:56.000 --> 26:58.400
Here, "All right, love? I'll grow on ya."

26:58.480 --> 27:00.840
[laughter]

27:00.920 --> 27:06.760
We do. We're a lovely, funny fungus,
and we cannot lose our sense of humor.

27:06.840 --> 27:10.760
But people on the right and the left
have started complaining about jokes.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.160
We live in a country

27:12.240 --> 27:15.040
where a comedian
was investigated by the police

27:15.120 --> 27:17.120
for a gag about a politician.

27:17.200 --> 27:21.320
Jo Brand mocked Nigel Farage,
and someone called the cops.

27:22.320 --> 27:25.240
It's the most un-British reaction
you've ever heard.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.680
"Hello? Officer, come quickly."

27:29.040 --> 27:30.040
"There's been a joke."

27:30.120 --> 27:32.000
[laughter]

27:32.920 --> 27:33.760
"Hurry."

27:34.280 --> 27:35.840
"I feel giggly."

27:36.840 --> 27:38.440
Then people go, "Hang on a minute."

27:38.520 --> 27:41.800
"What if someone
heard that joke and acted upon that joke?"

27:41.880 --> 27:44.520
You're like, "No one's ever done that,
you fuck knuckle."

27:44.600 --> 27:45.920
[laughter]

27:46.000 --> 27:48.520
Has anyone here
ever interrogated a chicken?

27:48.600 --> 27:50.200
-[audience cheering]
-[slapping sound]

27:50.280 --> 27:53.000
"Why did you cross the road?"

27:54.480 --> 27:57.400
It's crazy.
There's things to be upset about in life.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.160
Rape. Murder.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.120
Poverty. Homelessness.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.720
People who don't pick up dog shit.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.480
Not jokes. I'm serious about the dog shit.

28:05.560 --> 28:09.320
I found out recently if a baby
touches dog muck, they can go blind.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.720
What do they get when they go blind?
A dog.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.320
[laughter]

28:18.400 --> 28:19.240
Racism.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.440
That's something to be upset about
more than jokey-wokes.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.320
It's really reared its ugly head,
hasn't it, last couple of years?

28:26.400 --> 28:28.920
People booing footballers
who want to take a knee.

28:29.440 --> 28:33.240
An African-American is killed by police,
and people are screaming, quite rightly,

28:33.320 --> 28:35.680
that Black Lives Matter.
Then you get these morons,

28:35.760 --> 28:37.560
"I think you'll find

28:37.640 --> 28:40.720
all lives matter!"

28:41.600 --> 28:44.320
How could you be flippant about murder?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.720
Reckon they're like that with other stuff?
"Save the whales."

28:46.800 --> 28:48.400
"What about salmon?!"

28:48.480 --> 28:50.840
[laughter]

28:54.440 --> 28:55.480
"Happy Mother's Day."

28:55.560 --> 28:57.360
"You calling my dad a cunt?"

28:57.440 --> 28:59.200
[laughter]

29:00.320 --> 29:03.280
[cheering and applause]

29:08.720 --> 29:09.560
"No."

29:10.520 --> 29:11.840
"I mean, I imagine he is."

29:11.920 --> 29:13.920
[laughter]

29:15.200 --> 29:18.440
"We need to get rid of foreigners.
That's what's ruining this country."

29:18.520 --> 29:22.120
Jesus Christ. Foreign influence
is what makes this country.

29:22.200 --> 29:25.080
-It's what makes Britain great. It is.
-[whooping]

29:27.640 --> 29:30.440
Think of all the things
they've given this land.

29:30.520 --> 29:34.080
Roman roads. German beer. French kissing.

29:34.560 --> 29:35.800
Mexican waves.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.200
Dutch ovens.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.000
[laughter]

29:40.080 --> 29:41.920
Chinese burns.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.800
Can you imagine a zoo
in England without a foreign influence?

29:45.880 --> 29:47.480
"Behold! The hedgehog!"

29:47.560 --> 29:49.400
[laughter]

29:52.440 --> 29:55.560
We need foreign influence!
It's "Pythagoras' Theorem,"

29:55.640 --> 29:56.960
not "Jeff's Hunch"!

29:57.040 --> 29:59.520
[laughter]

29:59.600 --> 30:03.000
All these bigots singing
"Land of Hope and Glory"

30:03.080 --> 30:04.160
and "Rule, Britannia!"

30:04.240 --> 30:06.960
Why would you
sing a song that promotes slavery?

30:07.040 --> 30:09.120
There's so many great things
about this country.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.320
Slavery, and I'll roll in it,
ain't one of them.

30:12.400 --> 30:15.440
I say we change the lyrics,
and keep the old tune.

30:15.520 --> 30:17.920

30:49.760 --> 30:52.480
some people still
have a problem with sexuality.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.520
They were teaching primary school kids
about same-sex relationships.

30:55.600 --> 30:58.440
Some people lost their mind.
"It's disgusting!"

30:58.520 --> 31:00.800
"Teaching kids about gay shit."

31:00.880 --> 31:04.440

tolerance, not technique."

There's another man bear."

"Parents know best."
And you're like, "Not always."

31:55.600 --> 31:59.800
When my friend Tom was 12,
his parents made him do Morris dancing.

They made him.

Now he's covered in bells.

You ever tried hiding from bullies
with bells all over you?

"He's in the hedge!"
Cling-clang. Cling-clang.

Nothing's relevant when you're five.
It's fun. It's not relevant.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.040
Imagine feeling like
you're not in the right body.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.800
Must be exhausting.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.640
We've all got clothes
we don't like wearing.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.640
Imagine feeling you're not
what you're meant to be.

33:45.720 --> 33:47.360
Must be horrific.

33:47.440 --> 33:51.520
The way I feel about it, if you want me
to call you they, she, sir, madam, fine.

33:51.600 --> 33:54.880
I don't want to upset you.
All I ask, if I get the words wrong,

33:55.680 --> 33:56.840
don't have a go at me.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.240
[laughter]

33:58.320 --> 34:00.160
These are new words.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.600
And I'm English.

34:02.880 --> 34:05.080
You know what we're like with language.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.560
[laughter]

34:06.640 --> 34:10.640
We've seen ourselves in Spain.
"Do. You. Do. Chips?"

34:10.720 --> 34:12.640
[laughter]

34:12.720 --> 34:14.400
It takes us…

34:15.920 --> 34:18.120
"I said por favor, Sharon!"

34:18.200 --> 34:20.400
"Do. You."

34:23.320 --> 34:24.360
Must be tough.

34:24.880 --> 34:26.920
Imagine being born a man with a cock

34:27.000 --> 34:28.920
that was a burden rather than a playmate.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.240
Can you imagine that?

34:30.920 --> 34:33.280
'Cause it doesn't matter, fellas,
how bad our day is.

34:33.360 --> 34:35.520
Our dick will always be there for us.

34:35.600 --> 34:36.720
[laughter]

34:36.800 --> 34:38.000
"You all right, Jeff?"

34:39.960 --> 34:41.560
"You had a tough day at the office?"

34:41.640 --> 34:43.280
[laughter]

34:43.360 --> 34:44.440
Mm-hm.

34:45.200 --> 34:47.080
"Oh, Jeff."

34:47.160 --> 34:49.160
[laughter]

34:50.720 --> 34:52.040
"You know what we could do?"

34:52.120 --> 34:54.400
[laughter]

34:57.880 --> 34:58.720
"That's it, Jeff."

34:58.800 --> 35:00.880
♪ I love you ♪

35:00.960 --> 35:02.680
[laughter]

35:02.760 --> 35:04.680
♪ You love me ♪

35:04.760 --> 35:06.280
"Strangle me, Jeff!"

35:06.360 --> 35:07.240

35:07.320 --> 35:08.480

35:08.560 --> 35:09.400

[whooping and cheering]

35:12.480 --> 35:15.520
♪ Are a happy family ♪

35:16.440 --> 35:19.560
The point I'm making,
imagine not having that special bond.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.320
[laughter]

35:21.400 --> 35:23.800
We've run out of empathy in this country.

35:23.880 --> 35:26.880
What's frustrating, there's a game
going on. I'm not sure if you've noticed.

35:26.960 --> 35:32.400
The papers. "Woke culture. You can't say
what you want to say anymore."

35:32.480 --> 35:35.640
Meanwhile, knife crime
is the worst it's been since 1946.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.320
Nobody's speaking about that.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.200
-[whooping]
-It's ridiculous.

35:39.280 --> 35:42.080
[cheering and applause]

35:42.160 --> 35:47.160
1946. We've got kids
in London, age nine, carrying knives.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.360
That is important,
and that's something to be angry about,

35:51.440 --> 35:52.560
rather than jokes.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.040
Can you imagine that?

35:54.120 --> 35:56.720
Imagine being nine years old.
You're so terrified,

35:56.800 --> 35:58.960
you feel like you've got to carry a knife.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.840
Glasgow used to be
the murder capital of Europe.

36:02.920 --> 36:06.520
How'd they fix it?
By looking at it as a health problem,

36:06.600 --> 36:09.080
rather than a criminal one.
Our government could copy that.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.560
But they're not.
"It's not that, it's the music."

36:11.640 --> 36:15.560
"They listen to drill, rap, and grime,
and that's why they're so violent."

36:15.640 --> 36:17.680
-[whooping and cheering]
-It's ridiculous.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.120
'Cause that…

36:21.440 --> 36:23.160
that's a nine-year-old boy.

36:23.240 --> 36:26.040
That's not a criminal.
That's a scared little kid.

36:26.120 --> 36:29.720
When I was nine, the scariest thing
we had in our trousers was this.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.160
[laughter]

36:38.080 --> 36:40.080
[laughter]

36:43.040 --> 36:45.880
When I was nine,
this is how idyllic my childhood was.

36:45.960 --> 36:48.000
Me and my brother once cellotaped

36:48.080 --> 36:49.240
our arseholes

36:50.880 --> 36:53.080
to see if we could fart out of our mouth.

36:53.160 --> 36:55.560
[laughter]

37:01.080 --> 37:02.240
We need…

37:05.600 --> 37:07.840
We need to return to those glory days.

37:09.160 --> 37:12.920
The point I'm making, we've got kids,
aged nine, carrying knives,

37:13.000 --> 37:16.680
and adults ringing the police
about fucking jokes.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.800
-[whooping and cheering]
-It's ludicrous.

37:22.320 --> 37:26.080
We need more empathy in the world.
We're all the same, fundamentally.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.120
All trying to navigate life.
We're all a bit scared.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.800
It's tough being alive.
We've all got fears.

37:31.880 --> 37:33.280
COVID's been tough.

37:33.800 --> 37:37.520
I've had a brutal time. I've had
real trouble with my arse. A really…

37:37.600 --> 37:40.400
Like, I know it's funny instantly, but,

37:41.440 --> 37:43.160
I thought I was dying, right?

37:43.240 --> 37:45.880
It was so scary.
And I did what most blokes would do.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.640
"That don't feel right.
Well, fuck it, never mind."

37:48.720 --> 37:51.880
"I'll play FIFA
and grow a new arsehole. It'll be fine."

37:51.960 --> 37:53.560
[laughter]

37:53.640 --> 37:56.040
Then eventually you go to the doctor's.
That's terrifying.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.680
For some reason,
you can't talk in front of a doctor.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.680
You turn into a Victorian gent.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.200
I was like, "Hello, there's, you know…

38:03.280 --> 38:05.080
[laughter]

38:05.160 --> 38:06.200
…issues."

38:07.280 --> 38:09.120
I genuinely said to this doctor,

38:09.200 --> 38:10.560
"There's trouble at the mill."

38:10.640 --> 38:12.440
[laughter]

38:16.040 --> 38:17.560
He had a little rummage around.

38:17.640 --> 38:20.800
And nothing prepares you for that,
you know? He was like…

38:20.880 --> 38:21.840
[singing]

38:21.920 --> 38:23.400
He wasn't singing, I should say.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.840
[laughter]

38:24.920 --> 38:27.440
I was doing that
to make it less tense for you.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.120
Imagine that… [singing]

38:29.200 --> 38:31.080
What a way to lose your job, that'd be.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.520
"I've had enough being a doctor…"

38:32.600 --> 38:34.120
[singing]

38:34.200 --> 38:35.920
[drumming sound]

38:36.000 --> 38:37.120
[screaming]

38:38.680 --> 38:40.400
He didn't do that. He had a rummage.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.320
He told me I had
a thing called anal fissures.

38:42.400 --> 38:46.480
I was like, "What's that?" Turns out,
it's a little cut inside my anus.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.600
How did I acquire that? Good question.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.200
[laughter]

38:50.280 --> 38:52.840
I was doing a TV show,
and I found out how.

38:52.920 --> 38:56.800
We visited sleep experts,
and watched ourselves whilst we're asleep.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.800
Turns out, when I'm in the Land of Nod,

39:00.320 --> 39:01.760
I like to have a go at myself.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.120
[laughter]

39:04.840 --> 39:06.400
"Yeah." I don't…

39:06.480 --> 39:08.240
[whooping and applause]

39:08.320 --> 39:09.920
Everyone else is snoring.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.880
I'm like… "…You fuck."

39:11.960 --> 39:14.600
What dreams was I having
where that was appropriate?

39:14.680 --> 39:15.880
"Fucking dragons!"

39:18.640 --> 39:21.000
The point I'm making,
I understand how those kids feel.

39:21.080 --> 39:24.800
I've never carried a knife,
but I've carried the burden of fear.

39:24.880 --> 39:27.080
Wonder why we've lost this empathy, man.

39:27.160 --> 39:30.040
I think it's 'cause
we spend too much time online. You know?

39:30.120 --> 39:32.680
We're not together enough.
That's why this is amazing.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.760
We're together. We're humans again.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.000
We're not bots. We're not brands.

39:37.080 --> 39:40.240
You know? We behave online
in a way we'd never do in real life.

39:40.320 --> 39:41.760
Instagram's a great example.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.920
You can see a picture of
a girl in a bikini, you can like it.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.960
Imagine doing that in real life.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.040
[laughter]

39:48.120 --> 39:49.360
"I like that."

39:49.440 --> 39:52.080
[laughter]

40:01.160 --> 40:03.080
"Dave, give me that aubergine."

40:03.160 --> 40:05.280
[laughter]

40:05.360 --> 40:08.440
"I'm going to wave
a vegetable at a girl I don't know."

40:10.960 --> 40:12.760
We're very preoccupied with ourselves.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.240
"Look at me, I've got a Fitbit."
What a twat.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.800
[laughter]

40:16.880 --> 40:18.720
"So I can count my steps."

40:18.800 --> 40:20.440
[laughter]

40:20.520 --> 40:22.440
Sometimes I'll go for a walk
and I forget it.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.560
I'm distraught.
"That was a waste of time."

40:24.640 --> 40:26.440
[laughter]

40:28.560 --> 40:31.720
It's like I've forgotten my best friend.
What a weird friend that would be.

40:31.800 --> 40:36.080
Just behind you. "One, two, three, four."

40:36.600 --> 40:40.640
"I watch you when you sleep. Five, six."

40:42.880 --> 40:44.440
We're locked in, man.

40:45.520 --> 40:48.040
We're the generation
that invented selfies.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.800
We're gonna be
the dullest grandparents ever.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.360
"That's me."

40:54.440 --> 40:56.080
[laughter]

40:56.160 --> 40:57.120
"That's me."

40:58.600 --> 40:59.640
"That's me."

41:01.040 --> 41:01.920
"That's a Calippo."

41:02.000 --> 41:03.320
"It was hot that day."

41:03.400 --> 41:05.040
[laughter]

41:11.280 --> 41:15.680
The problem is, if we're taking selfies,
we can't make memories.

41:15.760 --> 41:19.000
Give me memories
over selfies any day of the week.

41:19.080 --> 41:23.480
-Selfies remind us of how we used to look.
-[whooping and scattered applause]

41:23.560 --> 41:25.920
But memories can just come along,

41:26.440 --> 41:28.160
and make you explode with joy.

41:28.680 --> 41:31.160
A girl in my class
couldn't get her calculator to work.

41:31.240 --> 41:35.000
She was knocking it against the desk
and our teacher went, "Stop it!"

41:35.080 --> 41:37.360
"How would you like it
if I banged you against that desk?"

41:37.440 --> 41:39.280
[laughter]

41:39.360 --> 41:42.800
[moaning]

41:42.880 --> 41:44.600
Thanks, memory.

41:45.480 --> 41:47.800
[whooping and applause]

41:48.840 --> 41:50.760
I love it when that happens.

41:51.400 --> 41:54.640
God, my mom gives me
so many of these, man.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.760
We were in a post office recently,

41:56.840 --> 41:59.160
and a woman
who was about 80 pushed in the queue.

41:59.240 --> 42:02.840
What I love about my mom
is my mom will hear words that I use,

42:02.920 --> 42:05.440
and she'll use them, even though
she doesn't know what they mean.

42:05.520 --> 42:06.480
[laughter]

42:06.560 --> 42:09.280
We're in the post office,
this woman about 80 pushed in,

42:09.360 --> 42:12.000
and my mom looked
at this 80-year-old woman and went,

42:12.080 --> 42:13.920
"Bloody nonce."

42:14.000 --> 42:16.320
[laughter]

42:20.720 --> 42:23.120
"Nonce?" "Yeah, nonce."

42:24.640 --> 42:25.680
"Annoying."

42:27.080 --> 42:28.080
"Inconsiderate."

42:28.160 --> 42:30.240
I was like,
"That's not what a nonce is, Mom."

42:30.320 --> 42:31.480
[laughter]

42:31.560 --> 42:32.880
"It's a pedophile."

42:34.080 --> 42:39.160
I've never seen
the color drain from her face quicker.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.920
It became apparent

42:45.000 --> 42:47.880
it wasn't the first time
she'd used the word "nonce" in public.

42:47.960 --> 42:49.680
[laughter]

42:49.760 --> 42:52.920
"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
It doesn't. Shut up! Shut up!

42:53.000 --> 42:55.240
"Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!"

42:55.320 --> 42:57.400
She'd been down the pub
with her friend Pat,

42:57.480 --> 42:59.360
she'd had two glasses of wine,
and Pat went,

42:59.440 --> 43:02.520
"Do ya want one more?"
And Mom went, "I better not, Pat."

43:02.600 --> 43:04.840
"I'll turn into a right nonce."

43:04.920 --> 43:07.520
[laughter]

43:11.560 --> 43:14.520
Sometimes these memories appear,
and they remind you

43:15.080 --> 43:17.520
of a defining moment in your life.

43:18.280 --> 43:23.360
I remember when I was 18,
my brother had a really bad epileptic fit.

43:23.440 --> 43:26.600
We found him on the floor.
He was blue. We were terrified.

43:26.680 --> 43:30.240
We thought he was going to die.
We got him to the hospital. He was okay.

43:30.320 --> 43:32.280
Two days later, he came back.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.840
He's full of bravado, don't give a shit.

43:34.920 --> 43:38.320
"All right. Papa Smurf back in the house."

43:38.400 --> 43:40.240
[laughter]

43:43.640 --> 43:44.840
But I knew it was bravado.

43:44.920 --> 43:47.000
Later that night, he knocked on my door.

43:47.080 --> 43:50.520
"D'ya mind if I sleep with ya tonight?
It's boring, innit, going to bed?"

43:50.600 --> 43:51.440
[laughter]

43:51.520 --> 43:54.240
"We should sleep in the same room."
He put his leg on me.

43:54.760 --> 43:56.160
I was like, "Okay, fine."

43:56.680 --> 43:59.520
"He's had a tough couple of days.
I can live with that."

44:00.440 --> 44:01.920
This went on for a year.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.440
[laughter]

44:04.520 --> 44:06.320
Slept with his leg on me.

44:07.480 --> 44:11.400
As an 18-year-old and a 16-year-old,
we slept together.

44:11.480 --> 44:13.640
Only recently I was like,
"What was all that about?"

44:13.720 --> 44:16.800
And my brother was like,
"Well, I was afraid to go to sleep

44:16.880 --> 44:18.200
in case I woke up dead."

44:18.280 --> 44:20.280
[laughter]

44:21.160 --> 44:23.200
"I didn't want to burden you with that."

44:23.280 --> 44:25.760
"So just slept with ya.
Remember I put my leg on ya?"

44:26.280 --> 44:30.040
"I thought if I started shaking,
you'd wake up and I'd be all right."

44:30.120 --> 44:31.240
[laughter]

44:31.320 --> 44:35.080
He didn't talk about it.
Imagine holding on to that for a year.

44:35.680 --> 44:38.480
I was like, "What made you
finally stop sleeping with me?"

44:38.560 --> 44:40.960
He looked at me and went,
"Well, I looked down one morning,

44:41.040 --> 44:43.440
you were fingering your own arsehole."

44:43.520 --> 44:45.360
[laughter]

44:45.440 --> 44:48.160
[cheering and applause]

44:56.960 --> 44:58.720
"I made my peace with God that day."

44:58.800 --> 45:00.080
[laughter]

45:00.160 --> 45:02.600
"I thought,
'I can go to hell, 'cause I've seen it.'"

45:02.680 --> 45:04.240
[laughter]

45:04.320 --> 45:06.960
"You were having a real go at yourself,
do you know that?"

45:08.160 --> 45:09.920
"You wanna wear boxing gloves."

45:15.240 --> 45:18.800
One of my favorite memories ever,
you'll all have had a moment like this,

45:18.880 --> 45:22.240
I was at a funeral. You know that feeling
when someone is no more,

45:22.320 --> 45:24.160
and their memory soars?

45:24.240 --> 45:27.280
I was thinking about my Uncle Tim.
It was his funeral.

45:27.360 --> 45:28.640
Tim was brilliant.

45:28.720 --> 45:31.120
My family are the reason
I've got a lazy eye.

45:31.200 --> 45:34.400
I'd be at parties when I was five.
There was so much madness going on,

45:34.480 --> 45:36.520
my eyes were like,
"We're going to have to split up."

45:36.600 --> 45:38.760
[laughter]

45:40.600 --> 45:42.600
Tim was the best.

45:42.680 --> 45:45.760
I remember when I was five,
he came up to me at a party and just went…

45:45.840 --> 45:47.040
[parping sound]

45:48.160 --> 45:49.120
And walked away.

45:49.200 --> 45:50.400
[laughter]

45:50.480 --> 45:52.800
The following year, he saw me again.
[parping sound]

45:53.880 --> 45:54.840
And off he went.

45:55.480 --> 45:57.720
By the time I was eight,
I knew what to expect.

45:57.800 --> 45:59.720
So I went up to him at a party and went…

45:59.800 --> 46:00.920
[parping sound]

46:01.000 --> 46:02.320
[laughter]

46:02.400 --> 46:03.440
And off I popped.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.120
And a game began.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.480
A game we never understood.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.560
[laughter]

46:09.640 --> 46:11.160
A game we never discussed.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.640
A game that went on for 35 years.

46:13.720 --> 46:15.760
[laughter]

46:15.840 --> 46:18.880
He once FaceTimed me at
two in the morning. "You all right, Tim?"

46:18.960 --> 46:19.880
[parping sound]

46:19.960 --> 46:22.280
[laughter]

46:22.360 --> 46:26.320
I was laughing and crying
at this beautiful piece of Silly String

46:26.400 --> 46:28.440
that connected us through the years.

46:28.520 --> 46:31.320
I told my little brother about it,
and this is where it got special.

46:31.400 --> 46:34.200
My brother's like, "You're joking,
aren't you? You are joking!"

46:34.280 --> 46:37.120
It turns out, every time Tim saw Daniel,

46:37.200 --> 46:38.040
he used to go…

46:38.120 --> 46:39.320
[whooping sound]

46:39.400 --> 46:41.280
[laughter]

46:42.080 --> 46:44.960
Every time he saw my cousin Lee, he went…
[honking sound]

46:46.000 --> 46:48.560
He had a different move
for every one of us!

46:49.320 --> 46:50.840
I've got 40 cousins!

46:52.240 --> 46:54.000
This man was exhausted!

46:54.080 --> 46:56.800
[laughter]

47:00.040 --> 47:02.600
But what a legacy to leave behind!

47:03.560 --> 47:08.200
Whenever you have the opportunity to
throw silly into the world, do it.

47:08.280 --> 47:12.200
Life is a battle, and silly is a rest.

47:12.280 --> 47:14.280
I'm already trying to be
more like my Uncle Tim

47:14.360 --> 47:17.760
whenever I get the opportunity.
Just be daft. Just be weird.

47:17.840 --> 47:21.080
I've taught my nephews, they're seven,
when they see Mom, they've got to go…

47:21.160 --> 47:22.600
"Ooh!"

47:22.680 --> 47:24.760
[laughter]

47:24.840 --> 47:26.480
"You been down the gym, girl?"

47:26.560 --> 47:28.560
[laughter]

47:29.800 --> 47:32.080
-Because…
-[cheering and applause]

47:32.160 --> 47:33.600
…I know she likes it.

47:34.600 --> 47:36.320
"Thanks for noticing, Wes."

47:37.240 --> 47:39.440
"I'm trying to keep
the wolf from the door."

47:40.800 --> 47:43.240
She's a silly, strange lady.
Not everyone's like that.

47:43.320 --> 47:45.880
I've got one auntie that's very angry.

47:45.960 --> 47:49.120
She's the kind of person,
the only way her candle can burn brightly

47:49.200 --> 47:50.680
is if she blows yours out.

47:50.760 --> 47:53.360
You know?
"Having fun, enjoying your life?"

47:53.440 --> 47:54.320
[blowing]

47:54.400 --> 47:56.280
[laughter]

47:57.040 --> 47:58.720
I was dicking around with the kids.

47:58.800 --> 48:01.520
And there is a better way to put it.

48:01.600 --> 48:03.400
[laughter]

48:03.480 --> 48:06.520
That is not
what you want on a special forever.

48:06.600 --> 48:09.600
I was being
really, really silly with the kids.

48:09.680 --> 48:11.280
I'm 41, they're seven.

48:11.360 --> 48:14.560
We've got this game
where I'll accuse them of being animals.

48:14.640 --> 48:17.160
So I'm like, "You are a weasel."

48:18.040 --> 48:20.800
They look at me and go, "You are a skunk."

48:21.520 --> 48:22.560
And we laugh.

48:22.640 --> 48:24.760
My auntie caught me doing this,

48:24.840 --> 48:26.840
and went, "Excuse me, can I have a word?"

48:28.000 --> 48:29.960
"Did you just call him a weasel?"

48:30.920 --> 48:32.040
I was like, "Yeah."

48:32.840 --> 48:35.800
She went, "We do not give people
nicknames in this family."

48:35.880 --> 48:37.360
"Thank you very much."

48:40.560 --> 48:41.920
I was like, "Well, we do."

48:42.000 --> 48:43.360
[laughter]

48:43.440 --> 48:44.880
"Wait 'til you leave the room."

48:44.960 --> 48:47.080
[laughter]

48:48.640 --> 48:50.320
The Howards are loose with language.

48:50.400 --> 48:53.840
When I was 12,
Dad said I was "as wet as a wanker's rag."

48:53.920 --> 48:55.880
[laughter]

48:55.960 --> 48:58.200
Nicknames are great.
We caught my friend Tom

48:58.280 --> 49:00.920
having a poo in the woods
when he was 12. Already a good day.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.120
Then Jason pointed at him
and went, "Forrest Dump."

49:04.200 --> 49:05.920
-That…
-[laughter]

49:06.800 --> 49:08.480
…is such a good nickname.

49:10.800 --> 49:14.160
When his mom found out about it,
she started calling him Forrest.

49:15.960 --> 49:18.120
He was late for his wedding.
His own mom went,

49:18.200 --> 49:20.080
"Run, Forrest, run!"

49:20.160 --> 49:22.000
[laughter]

49:26.760 --> 49:30.120
We're all after moments,
deathbed moments. That's what we want.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.600
Moments like Tim gave me.

49:31.680 --> 49:34.000
That's what we want
to give people we love.

49:34.080 --> 49:37.280
I love those moments in life.
Sometimes they're not even funny.

49:37.360 --> 49:39.360
They're almost like orgasms for your soul.

49:39.440 --> 49:42.200
Know what I mean?
I remember I was at Tim's wake.

49:42.280 --> 49:44.400
My second cousin, she was only five.

49:44.480 --> 49:46.400
She did something magnificent.

49:46.480 --> 49:48.120
She went up to my auntie,

49:48.200 --> 49:51.240
her nan, not the grumpy one, Tim's wife.

49:52.320 --> 49:53.920
She went, "Granny."

49:54.840 --> 49:57.400
"How many Christmases
did Granddad Tim have?"

49:57.480 --> 50:02.360
All the adults are there crying,
fighting back the tears.

50:02.440 --> 50:04.760
My auntie went, "He had 68."

50:05.280 --> 50:07.320
And this little girl just went,

50:07.400 --> 50:09.200
"Wow."

50:09.280 --> 50:11.600
[laughter]

50:11.680 --> 50:13.720
"He met Santa Claus

50:14.760 --> 50:16.720
68 times."

50:19.360 --> 50:20.800
"What a life."

50:20.880 --> 50:22.520
[laughter]

50:22.600 --> 50:24.480
And she danced out the room.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.760
It makes you feel good
hearing about it, doesn't it?

50:27.840 --> 50:29.120
[applause]

50:29.200 --> 50:31.160
Imagine being there, man.

50:33.920 --> 50:38.200
It was like she blew hope into our hearts.
And she did it with such swagger.

50:38.280 --> 50:41.960
You know that five-year-old nonchalance?
"All right, adults."

50:43.320 --> 50:44.760
"Everyone's a bit down."

50:45.280 --> 50:49.160
"Suppose I better
cheer you up with my childhood naivete."

50:49.240 --> 50:50.240
[laughter]

50:50.320 --> 50:51.920
"Give us your heart, Russ."

50:52.800 --> 50:55.600
[blowing]

51:00.960 --> 51:02.200
"That should do it."

51:03.880 --> 51:04.800
"Right."

51:05.600 --> 51:06.440
"I'm off."

51:06.520 --> 51:08.000
[laughter]

51:08.920 --> 51:10.880
"Things to do."

51:10.960 --> 51:12.480
[laughter]

51:12.560 --> 51:13.560
"I'm five."

51:15.400 --> 51:17.360
"That swing's not going to swing itself."

51:17.440 --> 51:19.040
[laughter]

51:19.120 --> 51:20.440
She danced out the room.

51:20.520 --> 51:23.640
The only way it could have been lovelier
is just before she left the room,

51:23.720 --> 51:25.960
if she looked at me and went…
[parping sound]

51:26.040 --> 51:27.840
[laughter]

51:27.920 --> 51:31.080
"Nobody dies until the memory does,

51:31.160 --> 51:35.440
and every moment has the potential
to become a memory."

51:36.240 --> 51:39.680
[wheezily] "Ignore the joy thieves,

51:40.680 --> 51:43.680
for they are many."

51:44.960 --> 51:48.800
"They would seek to criminalize laughter."

51:48.880 --> 51:52.000
"But they cannot exterminate it,

51:52.080 --> 51:56.480
for laughter is deeply human,

51:56.560 --> 52:00.280
and shall forever be."

52:00.360 --> 52:03.000
-But she didn't. She just walked out. But…
-[applause]

52:03.080 --> 52:03.960
[laughter]

52:04.040 --> 52:06.280
…I could tell what she was driving at.

52:07.920 --> 52:08.880
She was saying,

52:09.640 --> 52:11.120
in her own little way,

52:11.640 --> 52:15.840
that laughter is
the lubricant that makes life livable.

52:15.920 --> 52:18.040
You know when you see
someone playing the piano,

52:18.120 --> 52:20.680
and the notes are coming off,
and you're envious,

52:20.760 --> 52:23.160
'cause you can't make that noise. We can.

52:23.240 --> 52:27.800
Laughter is a musical instrument
that every one of us can play.

52:27.880 --> 52:29.640
And it travels across borders.

52:30.360 --> 52:32.480
There is no accent to laughs.

52:32.560 --> 52:35.000
It's ours. It's the fucking world's.

52:35.080 --> 52:36.280
It can connect us.

52:36.360 --> 52:40.440
And little tiny moments where you
provide a laugh for someone else,

52:40.520 --> 52:42.440
they are fucking vital.

52:42.520 --> 52:45.160
[whooping and cheering]

52:49.760 --> 52:50.920
[man] Fucking legend!

52:51.680 --> 52:53.400
What a bellow, sir.

52:53.480 --> 52:54.920
[laughter]

52:55.000 --> 52:58.320
Can you imagine if they were like that
in the tales of Arthur?

52:58.920 --> 53:00.840
"Hey! Arthur!"

53:00.920 --> 53:03.680
"You wanna get yourself
a fucking round table, mate!"

53:03.760 --> 53:06.120
[laughter]

53:07.160 --> 53:09.000
"Fucking legend, that geezer!"

53:11.520 --> 53:14.320
[poshly] They normally speak like that
in the historical dramas.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.080
You never have geezers in any films.
Wouldn't you love to hear you in film?

53:20.160 --> 53:21.480
Imagine you in Star Wars.

53:21.560 --> 53:23.080
"What? You ain't my fucking dad."

53:23.160 --> 53:25.600
[laughter]

53:27.120 --> 53:30.520
"Nah. Nah. Nah. Nah. Nah. Nah."

53:32.720 --> 53:34.800
I would love to see you in Star Wars.

53:35.320 --> 53:37.040
Just turning to the camera every so often.

53:37.120 --> 53:38.320
[groaning]

53:38.400 --> 53:40.680
"I've only tried to fuck my sister."

53:40.760 --> 53:43.240
[laughter]

53:44.760 --> 53:47.480
[applause]

53:55.000 --> 53:58.560
My favorite moment of this year…

54:00.960 --> 54:02.480
I was with my nephews.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.360
We're walking along.

54:05.120 --> 54:06.800
We see a cow in a field.

54:08.280 --> 54:10.520
I was trying to grab that,
and I couldn't get it.

54:10.600 --> 54:12.160
[laughter]

54:12.240 --> 54:14.320
"You wanna use the Force, mate!" I know.

54:14.400 --> 54:16.400
[laughter]

54:18.880 --> 54:21.880
We saw this cow in a field,
and I told my nephews,

54:21.960 --> 54:24.600
"I can talk to cows."
Their minds were blown.

54:25.240 --> 54:29.120
They were like, "Incredible, Uncle Fun.
Yet another thing this hero can do."

54:29.200 --> 54:31.000
[laughter]

54:32.520 --> 54:33.720
I said I can talk to them.

54:34.840 --> 54:35.880
Kids are excited.

54:36.880 --> 54:38.200
I looked at this cow and went…

54:38.280 --> 54:41.680
[mooing]

54:41.760 --> 54:43.280
And the cow walked away.

54:43.920 --> 54:46.120
[laughter]

54:47.640 --> 54:49.160
I can't have that.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.720
That can't be the memory.

54:51.240 --> 54:53.520
I imagined it like Tim's funeral.

54:53.600 --> 54:55.760
Them, not quite so happy as I was.

54:56.320 --> 54:59.280
"I remember the first time
I found out life was meaningless."

55:00.240 --> 55:02.520
"Uncle Fun said he could talk to cows."

55:03.200 --> 55:05.360
"It was nothing more
than a vicious falsehood."

55:05.440 --> 55:06.560
[laughter]

55:06.640 --> 55:08.760
"Within hours, I was hooked on heroin."

55:08.840 --> 55:11.040
[laughter]

55:11.120 --> 55:12.720
"Fucking light him up, vicar."

55:12.800 --> 55:14.200
[laughter]

55:15.120 --> 55:16.560
I thought, "I can't have that."

55:17.400 --> 55:19.920
So I looked this cow in the eyes,
best I could.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.280
[scattered laughter]

55:24.080 --> 55:27.360
And I summoned my inner bovine,
and just went…

55:27.440 --> 55:33.560
[intense mooing]

55:33.640 --> 55:36.320
And I kid you not,
this cow looked back at me and went…

55:36.400 --> 55:37.920
[mooing]

55:38.000 --> 55:39.360
[laughter]

55:39.440 --> 55:42.960
And these little boys
lost their tiny minds.

55:43.040 --> 55:44.400
[laughter]

55:44.480 --> 55:47.920
"What's she saying, Uncle Fun?
What's she saying?"

55:48.000 --> 55:51.360
"She says we need
to put LEGO in Grumpy Auntie's shoe."

55:51.440 --> 55:53.120
[laughter]

55:53.760 --> 55:54.880
It couldn't have gone better.

55:54.960 --> 55:56.600
[cheering and applause]

55:56.680 --> 55:57.720
He was like…

56:01.640 --> 56:03.520
We put the LEGO in her shoe.

56:03.600 --> 56:06.280
We were giggling
in anticipation of our joke.

56:06.360 --> 56:08.680
We had to cover…
You know when you laugh so much,

56:08.760 --> 56:10.160
you have to cover your mouth?

56:11.240 --> 56:13.280
"She's going to come downstairs."

56:14.840 --> 56:19.320
"Her foot's gonna touch the LEGO.
She's going to make a squeaky noise."

56:19.400 --> 56:21.200
[laughter]

56:21.280 --> 56:23.720
He's like, "Shut up, Russell.
You're going to ruin the joke."

56:23.800 --> 56:25.760
[laughter]

56:26.560 --> 56:28.400
"Keep your finger out
your hoop and all, chief."

56:28.480 --> 56:30.880
[laughter]

56:34.320 --> 56:35.400
We came downstairs.

56:37.120 --> 56:39.920
She was like that. How did she not
suspect something was going on?

56:40.000 --> 56:41.240
[laughter]

56:41.320 --> 56:43.840
A 41-year-old, a seven-year-old,
and a three-year-old like that.

56:43.920 --> 56:45.360
"Morning."

56:46.120 --> 56:47.240
[Russell giggling]

56:51.080 --> 56:52.720
"You probably need your shoes."

56:52.800 --> 56:54.320
[laughter]

56:57.240 --> 56:58.520
She put the shoe on.

56:59.640 --> 57:00.840
Time seemed to stop.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.640
Then this noise erupted from her.

57:04.720 --> 57:06.120
This noise.

57:06.200 --> 57:09.080
It sounded like
a goat falling down a well.

57:10.240 --> 57:11.960
[moaning]

57:13.240 --> 57:14.600
And then she flipped.

57:14.680 --> 57:16.960
She looked at me and went, "Did you…"
[gasping]

57:17.760 --> 57:19.040
"Did you do that?"

57:19.120 --> 57:22.720
"Did you put LEGO in my shoe,
you lazy-eyed prick?"

57:22.800 --> 57:24.640
[laughter]

57:24.720 --> 57:26.160
My nephew looked at her and went,

57:26.240 --> 57:28.920
"We don't give
people nicknames in this family."

57:29.000 --> 57:31.440
-[cheering and applause]
-Yes!

57:36.400 --> 57:38.080
There's no photos of that.

57:38.720 --> 57:42.240
Every moment has
the potential to become a memory.

57:42.320 --> 57:45.200
Ladies and gentlemen
of Hammersmith Apollo.

57:45.280 --> 57:47.320
Thank you so much for coming.

57:47.400 --> 57:49.040
[cheering and applause]

57:49.120 --> 57:51.320
What an absolute joy.

57:52.560 --> 57:53.680
It's been brilliant.

57:53.760 --> 57:55.440
Let's do it again.

57:56.240 --> 57:59.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much, man.

57:59.920 --> 58:01.000
What a gig.

58:01.520 --> 58:04.440
Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen

58:04.520 --> 58:07.200
of the Hammersmith Apollo,

58:08.840 --> 58:12.880
to the future!

58:12.960 --> 58:16.000
-[cheering and applause]
-[upbeat music playing]
