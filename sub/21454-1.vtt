03:13.001 --> 03:17.334
Let's speak frankly and openly.

03:20.209 --> 03:22.209
Frankly, as you say.

03:24.251 --> 03:25.834
Ask away.

03:31.376 --> 03:34.667
Mr. Jang Tee-young, What is your occupation?

03:34.917 --> 03:36.917
I run an export company.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.167
My friend also owns an export company,

03:39.167 --> 03:41.292
he gets nervous without his phone.

03:42.001 --> 03:44.876
But not you.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.876
He must have a small company.

03:46.917 --> 03:48.917
Your mannerism is quite courteous.

03:48.917 --> 03:54.542
You know how to dress,
wearing nothing but luxury goods.

03:54.917 --> 03:57.917
Even your neck tattoo is of
the highest quality.

03:58.167 --> 04:00.126
So what do you think I do?

04:00.126 --> 04:05.209
My first impression was a
smart gangster with a rich backer.

04:05.626 --> 04:09.292
But after our chat, I thought I might be wrong.

04:10.584 --> 04:14.417
You're a natural-born leader
and an ambitious man.

04:18.875 --> 04:22.834
You should be a leader, not a henchman.

04:35.376 --> 04:40.251
I crippled a town bully and went to the juvie.

04:42.209 --> 04:46.001
I met him there again and a fight broke out.

04:47.334 --> 04:49.001
So I castrated him.

04:49.876 --> 04:53.167
With GED, I went to a decent college.

04:53.709 --> 04:54.834
Then...

04:56.167 --> 04:59.417
He came after me and stabbed me in the waist.

05:00.792 --> 05:05.209
I cut his face in return and
he died from shock.

05:06.709 --> 05:08.501
I did 3 years for that,

05:08.584 --> 05:12.584
I was made after meeting my backer
and did a stint in prison again.

05:13.501 --> 05:18.417
But now, that backer works under me.

05:19.834 --> 05:21.917
Is this what you wanted to hear?

05:48.417 --> 05:50.917
On the surface, I look like a hooligan.

05:51.209 --> 05:53.667
This was a gunshot from someone else's fight.

05:54.834 --> 05:57.334
I got a scratch so I filled it in with tattoo.

05:58.376 --> 06:01.292
A crazy bitch bit off my nipple
so I had it sewn back on.

06:01.292 --> 06:02.834
Fucking bitch...

06:04.376 --> 06:08.584
Got stabbed in the thigh by a loanshark.

06:12.334 --> 06:14.334
Got my dick pierced.

06:15.126 --> 06:16.834
Both testicles in tact.

06:17.417 --> 06:18.751
That is all, doctor.

06:29.334 --> 06:31.959
That was quite enlightening.

06:32.084 --> 06:35.792
Being this honest will work?
With your treatment.

06:36.292 --> 06:37.917
If you don't strip often.

06:38.292 --> 06:40.167
Aren't you afraid of me?

06:41.834 --> 06:43.167
Should I be?

06:44.917 --> 06:46.501
That's what I'm used to.

06:50.709 --> 06:52.334
Yes, a little bit.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.876
You're looking for someone
with the same tattoo,

07:09.292 --> 07:11.209
could you explain why?

07:12.792 --> 07:14.792
My woman was raped.

07:17.751 --> 07:20.209
Okay, we'll get to that later.

07:25.459 --> 07:28.334
These are Russian nesting dolls.

07:28.501 --> 07:31.084
Pick 2 that you fancy.

07:31.709 --> 07:33.459
Biggest and 2nd biggest.

07:33.459 --> 07:34.917
- Between the 2?
- Biggest.

07:34.917 --> 07:37.834
Different faces and colors,
so why pick by size?

07:37.834 --> 07:40.542
Which one do you think was made first?

07:40.959 --> 07:42.292
- Well...
- Please tell me.

07:42.292 --> 07:44.667
- I'm not sure.
- Just blurt it out.

07:44.834 --> 07:47.917
"Not sure," is my answer.

07:48.084 --> 07:49.209
But just one.

07:56.959 --> 07:58.584
I said I'm not sure.

07:59.167 --> 08:02.376
Your action was a good answer.

08:04.459 --> 08:06.084
I went overboard.

08:06.084 --> 08:08.584
No, you're a patient and I'm a doctor.

08:08.751 --> 08:11.917
I'm responsible for anything during a session.

08:12.459 --> 08:17.126
Let's get back to you.

08:35.958 --> 08:39.083
I have Mr. Jang's charts from the rehab center.

08:44.626 --> 08:47.626
After removing the pins,
the collarbones went up.

08:48.251 --> 08:50.542
Ms. Song Yoo-hwa from the rehab center.

08:51.334 --> 08:52.167
Yes?

08:52.334 --> 08:55.334
My shoulder's giving me trouble,
could you take a look?

08:55.834 --> 08:57.917
Do I need physiotherapy?

09:07.584 --> 09:10.084
The ligament is damaged quite a bit.

09:10.542 --> 09:13.084
You should get it examined properly.

09:13.084 --> 09:14.167
Thank you.

09:16.459 --> 09:19.542
How long have you treated him?

09:20.501 --> 09:22.251
Over 6 months.

09:22.251 --> 09:23.542
Thank you.

09:28.792 --> 09:31.876
Never knew our clinic had such a beauty.

09:33.334 --> 09:35.209
How long have you dated her?

09:38.917 --> 09:40.126
How did you know?

09:40.626 --> 09:42.376
Trade secret.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.959
Only 4 weeks left of your treatment.

09:48.751 --> 09:51.251
Are we going to chit chat the entire time?

09:51.334 --> 09:55.709
You exhibit symptoms of
dissociative identity disorder.

09:56.209 --> 10:00.917
As you know your being is divided into 2 egos,

10:01.126 --> 10:06.417
and you share the name,
age and gender with the other ego.

10:06.751 --> 10:12.709
When it takes over,
you suffer short term amnesia,

10:12.876 --> 10:17.709
this condition cannot be treated
even with modern technology.

10:20.459 --> 10:23.209
So why did you guarantee a full recovery?

10:26.084 --> 10:30.542
You've committed murder, have you not?

10:33.001 --> 10:35.792
What I do is something similar.

10:36.626 --> 10:42.542
For the next 4 weeks,
we'll murder your other ego.

10:47.876 --> 10:49.876
I'm getting the chills.

10:51.001 --> 10:52.167
Will you consent?

10:56.917 --> 10:59.876
Please lie down and we'll get started.

11:02.834 --> 11:06.542
I'll try to keep you here when you wake up.

11:07.251 --> 11:10.417
I know, there's a place he goes to.

11:11.209 --> 11:14.167
The other ego is still part of you,

11:14.167 --> 11:17.917
were you not insulted by
the use of word 'murder'?

11:18.834 --> 11:19.792
Not at all.

11:19.792 --> 11:23.751
Answer my questions freely
with memories that pop up.

11:23.751 --> 11:27.667
You can sleep if you want to.
Please close your eyes.

11:32.376 --> 11:37.001
You've seen your other ego with your own eyes.

11:39.001 --> 11:40.126
When...

11:41.334 --> 11:42.792
was that?

12:27.584 --> 12:30.667
(Councilor Choi proposes a Resort-Casino Combo)

12:36.542 --> 12:40.167
Mr. Jang, you're our best fixer.

13:35.167 --> 13:36.667
Can you see?

13:38.251 --> 13:42.834
Let's continue our chat.

13:48.292 --> 13:50.792
First time waking up since last week?

13:53.542 --> 13:55.876
Staying away from drugs?

14:08.501 --> 14:10.876
Made some money as gonzo journalist?

14:16.376 --> 14:22.376
I sold stories to stations
and magazines as a freelancer.

14:23.001 --> 14:27.584
No name or photos on your profile.

14:28.167 --> 14:31.126
Reporting must be done discreetly.

14:31.542 --> 14:37.292
How can someone believe
that you're real with this?

14:38.959 --> 14:40.167
Doesn't matter.

14:40.542 --> 14:42.084
Philip Marlowe...

14:42.084 --> 14:44.667
"If I wasn't hard, I wouldn't be alive.

14:45.917 --> 14:49.042
"If I couldn't ever be gentle,
I wouldn't deserve to be alive."

14:49.917 --> 14:51.626
Did you live that way?

14:51.709 --> 14:52.792
No.

14:55.042 --> 14:57.167
I wished to live that way.

14:57.376 --> 15:00.417
I've seen cases where egos transform,

15:00.584 --> 15:02.959
but in your case,

15:04.417 --> 15:07.876
there's no contact between the two.

15:12.001 --> 15:14.917
How does it feel to have a body?

15:15.167 --> 15:17.417
What was it like to see him for the first time?

15:18.167 --> 15:19.417
Afraid?

16:58.334 --> 17:00.626
If you die here,

17:03.042 --> 17:04.791
another being will die too.

17:07.791 --> 17:12.959
Your ego was killed
3 years ago after overdosing,

17:13.376 --> 17:15.126
so you're untreatable.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.791
There are 2 options:

17:17.166 --> 17:21.084
overdose again, or commit suicide while high.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.626
But there are 2 of you in there.

17:25.001 --> 17:26.376
So it's murder.

17:28.084 --> 17:30.584
There's a way for you to die alone.

17:47.501 --> 17:49.501
- Who is he?
- Car accident victim.

17:49.501 --> 17:50.501
Let's move him.

19:05.709 --> 19:09.376
We cannot exclude willful negligence,

19:09.376 --> 19:12.709
upon his death, the government
may seize his assets.

19:12.709 --> 19:15.167
It's too early to judge whether he'll die.

19:15.584 --> 19:17.376
You're thinking too far ahead.

19:17.626 --> 19:19.251
But go ahead with the trial.

19:19.709 --> 19:21.501
Even if he's brain dead,

19:21.501 --> 19:24.834
our law firm will handle
his inheritance as per contract.

21:27.542 --> 21:30.751
(A man came in.)

22:40.417 --> 22:44.584
2 people cannot exist in a single body.

22:47.209 --> 22:50.626
A man lives in my body,

22:51.417 --> 22:53.417
I should not die.

22:56.292 --> 23:01.417
Doctor's method for killing just me

23:02.959 --> 23:04.792
was rather simple.

23:09.209 --> 23:14.084
I will now enter your body

23:15.917 --> 23:18.251
and confirm that death.

23:23.959 --> 23:28.584
You're going to die as a vegetable anyway.

23:30.542 --> 23:35.709
When I first saw you,
your body was in shambles.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.584
How did you stay alive with so much pain?

23:47.876 --> 23:49.417
Don't worry.

23:52.667 --> 23:55.334
I will now choke you to death.

23:58.334 --> 24:01.251
When you die, I will die too.

24:04.042 --> 24:06.042
If you wanted to live,

24:09.917 --> 24:11.292
I'm sorry.

24:36.584 --> 24:38.542
I don't fucking believe this!

24:38.542 --> 24:39.709
Leaving already?

24:47.834 --> 24:48.876
What the...

25:17.292 --> 25:20.792
(6 months later)

26:18.417 --> 26:23.459
Alright, everybody, enjoy Siesta!

26:24.334 --> 26:27.417
Let's all chant and get things started!

27:48.376 --> 27:49.501
Yes, doctor.

27:49.917 --> 27:51.417
What's certain is,

27:51.834 --> 27:55.834
he witnessed a patient
he regarded as a friend die.

27:56.542 --> 28:01.126
So your insomnia went away 6 months ago.

28:02.792 --> 28:05.251
I'm sure the other ego is gone.

28:05.959 --> 28:07.584
As I promised.

28:08.126 --> 28:10.834
It went away when the vegetable died.

28:13.126 --> 28:14.751
Enjoy your game.

28:15.376 --> 28:16.792
Thank you for everything.

28:49.334 --> 28:50.334
So?

28:51.542 --> 28:55.042
How else would I know Cho
and the governor's arrangement?

28:55.417 --> 28:57.084
Why must I...

28:57.417 --> 29:00.834
hand over half of the casino stake to Cho?

29:03.417 --> 29:04.917
Let me take this.

29:11.292 --> 29:13.834
What did I say I'd do
if you ever touch drugs again?

29:16.334 --> 29:18.751
I'll never give my stake to that bastard.

29:33.376 --> 29:36.376
(Freelance journalist Jang Tee-young)

29:43.751 --> 29:45.042
Shall we stop tailing?

30:02.667 --> 30:06.126
If you're willing to pay the
premium, I can get you anything.

30:06.959 --> 30:10.376
Name change is done, asset
distribution is almost done,

30:10.584 --> 30:12.667
but you're free to spend your money.

30:14.459 --> 30:17.501
The plastic surgeon said that the
surgery was a success,

30:17.501 --> 30:20.792
and the forehead came out
exactly as you wanted.

30:20.792 --> 30:23.917
And vocal cord will be worked
on next Wednesday.

30:24.709 --> 30:26.542
Mr. Jang Tee-young.

30:27.251 --> 30:30.876
May I ask why you changed your name to his?

30:33.167 --> 30:35.084
It was my name.

30:39.959 --> 30:42.376
Call me that name again.

30:42.584 --> 30:45.542
Sure, I actually like that name.

30:46.292 --> 30:47.917
Mr. Jang Tee-young.

31:10.917 --> 31:12.917
You're complicating things.

31:15.751 --> 31:17.417
No greetings?

31:20.292 --> 31:22.709
Shouldn't you lay low a lot longer?

31:24.542 --> 31:26.626
I heard you killed people.

31:34.209 --> 31:35.667
You know me?

31:36.667 --> 31:38.334
"You know me?"

31:38.334 --> 31:40.959
Don't be curt, Mr. Jang.

31:42.417 --> 31:44.084
What happened was...

31:55.584 --> 31:59.209
How about we start with an apology?

32:10.417 --> 32:12.751
'Siesta' is a name I gave.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.626
You look like a small-time hooligan,

32:18.542 --> 32:20.417
why not keep to yourself?

32:24.292 --> 32:27.917
Getting agitated shouldn't be
the only thing you do.

32:29.709 --> 32:30.751
Name?

32:32.001 --> 32:33.751
Who cares about that.

32:35.626 --> 32:37.334
Regardless of who built it,

32:38.126 --> 32:39.709
I bought it,

32:40.542 --> 32:41.876
so it's mine.

32:43.667 --> 32:45.917
If it's unfair, then buy it back.

32:46.584 --> 32:50.042
Don't be a crybaby if you don't have the goods.

32:52.042 --> 32:53.709
Fucking bitch.

33:00.792 --> 33:03.459
I really like your fighting spirit.

33:04.167 --> 33:08.792
Do whatever it takes to
put together a war chest.

33:10.667 --> 33:12.042
Who knows,

33:13.209 --> 33:14.792
I may lose.

33:17.751 --> 33:18.917
I'm off.

33:26.417 --> 33:27.542
Interesting.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.876
Look into brokers around Cho.

33:42.834 --> 33:44.042
What is it?

33:47.042 --> 33:48.042
Stress.

33:52.251 --> 33:54.834
There are others, so please be quiet.

34:06.626 --> 34:09.126
Looks like you got wrecked.

34:11.251 --> 34:12.333
Indeed.

34:13.167 --> 34:15.458
I'm rebuilding it.

34:17.751 --> 34:19.376
What's with the voice?

34:19.376 --> 34:24.208
It's temporary until my voice is reworked.

34:30.667 --> 34:32.333
Mr. Jang Tee-young.

34:34.626 --> 34:36.501
You two have same names.

34:37.792 --> 34:41.208
Mr. Jang, please follow me to the rehab pool.

34:41.792 --> 34:44.083
Good to meet you, Mr. Jang Tae-young.

34:44.751 --> 34:46.751
I'm Jang Tae-young.

34:59.167 --> 35:00.959
Mr. Baek, I'm sorry...

35:00.959 --> 35:03.459
it's...all my fault.

35:06.084 --> 35:08.292
Please...Mr. Baek...

35:09.292 --> 35:13.042
I can put together $6 million by tomorrow!

35:13.334 --> 35:16.626
Don't kill me!

35:17.917 --> 35:19.084
It's all my fault!

35:19.084 --> 35:21.626
I'm a fucking bastard!

35:30.376 --> 35:33.834
Please...Don't kill me...

35:51.292 --> 35:52.417
Excuse me.

35:54.792 --> 35:59.542
My client is interested in Siesta Casino.

36:06.959 --> 36:08.959
Who should I be talking to?

36:12.209 --> 36:16.834
I crippled a town bully and went to the juvie.

36:18.376 --> 36:22.167
I met him there again and a fight broke out.

36:23.417 --> 36:25.209
So I castrated him.

36:26.917 --> 36:31.917
I cut his face in return
and he died from shock.

36:34.042 --> 36:36.876
He's an enthusiastic type,
so he bit the offer immediately.

36:38.084 --> 36:39.542
His condo was empty.

36:39.959 --> 36:43.417
Due to his casino business,
he lives at a hotel nearby.

36:44.209 --> 36:47.709
One of my men found this in the condo.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.584
He was a gonzo reporter.

36:54.167 --> 36:55.917
It was quite a find.

36:56.709 --> 36:59.209
It's a 24-hour access key to the rehab center.

36:59.584 --> 37:02.834
Ms. Song Yoo-hwa will be assigned to you.

37:03.417 --> 37:05.626
This is something I put together,

37:05.626 --> 37:07.626
you'll find it interesting.

37:18.042 --> 37:19.751
This is real.

37:19.751 --> 37:21.542
It's the real pasta.

37:28.001 --> 37:29.126
Good?

37:35.334 --> 37:36.751
This is real.

37:37.584 --> 37:40.001
It's the real pasta.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.917
Is your insomnia really gone?

39:19.251 --> 39:22.501
And no more therapy?

39:23.751 --> 39:27.584
Yeah, migraine's gone too.

39:32.126 --> 39:33.792
Siesta...

39:35.542 --> 39:37.542
Why did you call it that?

39:38.042 --> 39:41.084
I don't know, it just came to mind.

39:42.417 --> 39:48.084
Win or lose at the casino, it's all just a nap.

39:49.667 --> 39:52.501
I thought you'd say something spectacular.

39:55.001 --> 40:00.001
The only thing spectacular is right here.

40:36.792 --> 40:40.417
It's too bright here. Let's go to bed.

40:41.792 --> 40:43.792
Then put this on.

40:45.501 --> 40:46.667
Amazing.

40:47.751 --> 40:49.917
You look like an action movie star.

41:25.334 --> 41:27.042
So we meet again.

41:31.126 --> 41:32.917
Do you know each other?

41:34.501 --> 41:37.584
Probably a coincidence. Your voice is...

41:37.792 --> 41:40.501
I'm getting used to the new vocal cord.

41:41.626 --> 41:43.292
Very interesting.

41:43.292 --> 41:44.834
What's with the camera?

41:44.834 --> 41:46.792
A professional habit.

41:47.292 --> 41:49.667
I'm a freelance gonzo reporter.

41:50.501 --> 41:52.709
- That's unexpected.
- What is?

41:53.584 --> 41:56.792
Being a millionaire, I thought you didn't work.

41:58.042 --> 42:00.876
I'll let you two talk in private.

42:10.459 --> 42:12.542
As your lawyer mentioned,

42:12.959 --> 42:15.584
match Sewon idea's $60 million investment,

42:15.584 --> 42:18.834
and just collect the dough every month.

42:20.167 --> 42:21.792
It's a good deal.

42:22.042 --> 42:23.626
I heard the terms.

42:23.626 --> 42:28.792
A recently released gang boss stole
capital you were working on.

42:30.417 --> 42:34.751
I could be in danger if we partner up.

42:40.459 --> 42:42.459
Are you backing out?

42:43.834 --> 42:46.042
I didn't have to come if you did.

42:49.084 --> 42:50.792
Don't misunderstand.

42:51.251 --> 42:56.167
Dangerous, perhaps,
but there's work we must do.

42:58.376 --> 43:02.084
How about dinner on the weekend?

43:13.459 --> 43:15.626
Happy birthday and I love you!

43:17.917 --> 43:19.126
Come here!

43:19.751 --> 43:21.709
These are people I work with.

43:21.834 --> 43:23.167
Good to meet you. Welcome!

43:23.167 --> 43:25.167
Good evening, welcome.

43:30.876 --> 43:34.376
This is the greatest dish from my hometown.

43:34.376 --> 43:35.751
It's called Beggar's Chicken.

43:37.376 --> 43:43.876
A beggar stole a chicken,
and hid it in the mud,

43:43.876 --> 43:47.959
Qing dynasty emperor was passing
by and tried it,

43:47.959 --> 43:49.876
and instantly became a hit.

43:53.542 --> 43:54.876
How is it?

43:56.709 --> 44:00.167
It may look disgusting,
but the taste is top-notch.

44:00.167 --> 44:03.209
Dishes and people
shouldn't be judged based on looks.

44:03.209 --> 44:06.501
I may feel like a sore thumb to you,

44:06.501 --> 44:10.834
but we must partner up for us to survive.

44:11.042 --> 44:14.334
No, you need to bail to survive.

44:15.667 --> 44:18.876
Even if you start a war against me,

44:18.876 --> 44:21.292
we're still just pawns.

44:23.042 --> 44:25.792
You got the brand, I got the history.

44:26.167 --> 44:28.001
We split the casino half-half.

44:28.001 --> 44:30.167
I got your back from now,

44:30.167 --> 44:33.834
this is my gentle proposal.

44:35.501 --> 44:38.376
No, sounds like a threat.

44:40.334 --> 44:43.042
I know you don't have the funds.

44:44.459 --> 44:45.626
Bluffing doesn't suit you.

44:45.626 --> 44:47.376
Choi said that?

44:51.001 --> 44:53.501
I'll give it a thought.

44:55.459 --> 44:56.959
By the way...

44:58.792 --> 45:01.334
I saw this tattoo somewhere.

45:02.417 --> 45:05.917
I heard you're looking desperately for it.

45:06.334 --> 45:07.251
Where?

45:14.042 --> 45:14.876
Daddy!

45:14.876 --> 45:16.251
My baby!

45:16.251 --> 45:18.126
You were hiding here?

45:19.084 --> 45:20.584
See you again.

45:21.542 --> 45:23.167
Did you hide long?

45:23.417 --> 45:24.417
Let's go!

45:29.501 --> 45:32.209
So the old lady took off her denture and said,

45:33.959 --> 45:36.417
"we swapped teeth and did it."

45:40.209 --> 45:44.167
We got many older patients,
so we start the day with these jokes.

45:44.292 --> 45:46.042
Same jokes never get old.

45:46.834 --> 45:50.292
Speaking of dentures, I got a story too.

45:52.209 --> 45:55.876
My partner Noh is an ex-homicide detective.

45:56.876 --> 45:59.376
He was quite a character.

45:59.876 --> 46:02.209
We listen in on the police radio,

46:02.417 --> 46:05.584
and arrive at crime scenes before they do,

46:05.751 --> 46:09.292
so we wear diapers in the car during stakeouts.

46:09.501 --> 46:10.792
Is this you?

46:10.792 --> 46:13.751
I'm usually behind the camera.

46:14.501 --> 46:20.084
We were caught doing it,
so we played the crazies.

46:20.084 --> 46:21.501
Why do you do this?

46:30.709 --> 46:32.334
I'll save the shoptalk.

46:32.667 --> 46:33.876
Well, anyway...

46:34.959 --> 46:37.792
- This is...
- I'm Han Ye-won.

46:39.501 --> 46:41.376
Sorry for being late.

46:53.584 --> 46:55.376
She's my girlfriend.

46:58.126 --> 46:59.584
Is this a joke?

47:00.001 --> 47:01.084
What is?

47:01.376 --> 47:03.417
You appear suddenly and ask to partner up,

47:03.584 --> 47:06.876
same name, same rehab, and now this woman.

47:08.626 --> 47:10.042
You're playing with fire.

47:10.042 --> 47:12.667
It's a trendy dress, I feel terrible.

47:13.334 --> 47:15.001
Shall I go change?

47:15.292 --> 47:17.292
I should be saying that to you.

47:18.292 --> 47:22.876
From where I stand, you're just a name,

47:23.542 --> 47:26.501
and you came to me desperate for funding.

47:32.917 --> 47:34.584
Yoo-hwa, my apologies.

47:36.917 --> 47:38.542
I'm slightly drunk.

47:41.626 --> 47:43.626
We'll let you two chat.

47:43.876 --> 47:45.959
Ye-won, let's go to the bar.

47:45.959 --> 47:47.959
Cheese gratin here is amazing.

47:57.417 --> 47:59.417
To be honest,

48:01.167 --> 48:03.126
I wasn't interested in casino business.

48:09.667 --> 48:11.417
Is that so?

48:12.334 --> 48:14.334
Don't misunderstand,

48:15.667 --> 48:17.334
you'll get the money.

48:18.667 --> 48:20.459
But there is a condition.

48:20.959 --> 48:23.542
I've been after a mob boss for years,

48:23.792 --> 48:25.751
he was recently released.

48:26.251 --> 48:27.917
Cho Won-geun?

48:28.751 --> 48:33.667
Yes, I need him to dig even deeper.

48:35.542 --> 48:36.876
Yeah?

48:36.876 --> 48:38.709
Is this a coincidence too?

48:38.709 --> 48:40.167
I need to fuck him up too.

48:40.167 --> 48:43.251
That's why I want to partner up with you.

48:43.376 --> 48:45.376
What is it that you're after?

48:46.667 --> 48:47.876
Cocaine.

48:49.292 --> 48:50.292
Fuck...

48:54.917 --> 48:58.376
You are grotesque and unnerving,

48:58.834 --> 49:00.584
but we just click.

49:02.876 --> 49:04.292
It's weird...

49:05.501 --> 49:06.834
Let's do it.

49:07.834 --> 49:09.626
Got any other requests?

49:10.584 --> 49:13.459
I want to carve your face out,

49:15.459 --> 49:18.042
and put it on my face.

49:19.501 --> 49:23.126
This face is rather troublesome.

49:27.042 --> 49:29.542
I could forgo the contract and kill you.

49:33.792 --> 49:35.584
It was a joke.

49:36.626 --> 49:39.042
My apologies, if I offended you.

49:42.292 --> 49:44.292
This is the contract.

50:23.167 --> 50:27.709
I heard Jang's funds dried up,
where did he get the money?

50:28.417 --> 50:29.959
What happened?

50:30.376 --> 50:34.834
This casino deal's making me mad.

50:47.584 --> 50:48.876
Bon appetit.

50:52.292 --> 50:55.542
Frying it lightly removed some poison,

50:55.917 --> 50:58.417
but there's enough to kill you in 3 days.

51:00.376 --> 51:01.917
I'm sorry, sir.

51:02.209 --> 51:04.042
Have a great meal.

51:41.209 --> 51:44.001
Should I start now?

51:47.167 --> 51:50.501
Ready, action.

51:56.792 --> 51:58.084
Siesta...

52:02.251 --> 52:04.459
Why did you call it that?

52:05.792 --> 52:09.251
I don't know, it just came to mind.

52:11.667 --> 52:16.834
Win or lose at the casino, it's all just a nap,

52:17.376 --> 52:20.001
I thought you'd say something fantastic.

52:28.751 --> 52:30.042
Wrong.

52:31.292 --> 52:33.292
"Something spectacular."

52:37.209 --> 52:38.792
Try again.

52:41.792 --> 52:46.959
Win or lose at the casino, it's all just a nap,

52:47.209 --> 52:49.876
I thought you'd say something spectacular.

52:53.584 --> 53:00.792
The only thing spectacular is right here.

53:20.876 --> 53:24.292
It's too bright here. Let's go to bed.

53:28.209 --> 53:30.042
Then put this on.

53:36.626 --> 53:37.792
Amazing.

53:39.376 --> 53:41.876
You look like an action movie star.

54:18.459 --> 54:20.834
Okay, gonna be late?

54:40.626 --> 54:42.626
I brought something good,

54:42.917 --> 54:44.834
could I come in for a bit?

55:01.834 --> 55:03.834
How could you not drink this?

55:08.292 --> 55:10.876
Speak your mind and please leave.

55:12.584 --> 55:14.959
Where did you work 2 years ago?

55:17.834 --> 55:19.126
A private hospital.

55:21.459 --> 55:23.334
You had a husband then.

55:27.876 --> 55:28.834
Get out!

55:29.667 --> 55:31.251
Should I call the police?

55:36.334 --> 55:40.209
Since you're assigned to me,
my lawyer vetted you.

55:43.542 --> 55:46.084
He was a CRPS patient.

55:46.626 --> 55:49.626
Incapable of love, land always in pain.

55:50.542 --> 55:52.709
It was a paper marriage,
for insurance purposes.

55:52.709 --> 55:55.084
Fell in love when he was in pain,

55:56.126 --> 55:58.667
and left him after his treatment was over.

56:00.334 --> 56:03.751
You're dating Jang for similar reasons.

56:04.834 --> 56:06.334
In summary,

56:06.917 --> 56:11.667
I was told to watch out
since you love men in pain.

56:14.334 --> 56:16.334
It was something like that.

56:18.542 --> 56:20.126
Quite a story.

56:32.417 --> 56:36.001
If I don't take this med,
you'll hear my scream.

56:41.251 --> 56:42.917
That was not in your chart.

56:42.917 --> 56:45.126
Left out, so you wouldn't know.

56:47.709 --> 56:48.709
But that's...

56:53.334 --> 56:55.334
Come take this off.

56:59.834 --> 57:01.834
I came to ask you that.

57:02.792 --> 57:04.792
I was afraid to look at it alone.

57:54.917 --> 57:56.876
Why didn't you take the pill?

58:00.876 --> 58:03.542
Because you love men in pain.

58:06.001 --> 58:07.417
Got any more?

58:08.501 --> 58:09.751
Look at my face.

58:14.334 --> 58:16.042
What do I look like?

58:22.376 --> 58:24.667
Leave it on, it might not heal.

58:26.542 --> 58:28.376
Take the rest off.

59:07.209 --> 59:09.042
Banker 0, player win.

59:11.751 --> 59:13.667
You should get some sleep.

59:15.834 --> 59:17.542
I lost half in 2 days.

59:18.667 --> 59:23.834
Song displayed maternal instinct
when I was in pain.

59:24.834 --> 59:26.376
How did you know?

59:26.834 --> 59:32.167
Those who look after sick parent
or animals as children,

59:32.667 --> 59:35.626
grow up to have strong maternal instinct,

59:36.334 --> 59:39.501
I thought Song was such case.

59:42.834 --> 59:45.292
So, to Song, is Jang Tae-young

59:45.292 --> 59:47.667
someone readily replaceable?

59:48.709 --> 59:54.667
She'll always fall in love with
a ferocious man who needs her.

59:55.167 --> 59:56.667
Why?

59:56.667 --> 59:58.626
Wanna steal his woman?

01:00:01.584 --> 01:00:03.334
$100,000, as promised.

01:00:03.584 --> 01:00:07.167
Please send me Jang's charts by next week.

01:01:58.292 --> 01:02:00.792
Cho Won-geun, you fucking bitch.

01:02:07.876 --> 01:02:10.376
Are you going to blame me for it too?

01:02:21.876 --> 01:02:25.792
Your lawyer is exceptional.

01:02:26.417 --> 01:02:28.167
Because he's expensive.

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:35.626
Here's a card key.

01:02:35.626 --> 01:02:38.667
(Jang Tae-young)

01:02:42.042 --> 01:02:44.042
You wore glasses back then?

01:02:44.417 --> 01:02:46.751
Your questions are irritating.

01:02:47.792 --> 01:02:51.584
With this condo over to you,
the contract's fulfilled,

01:02:51.584 --> 01:02:52.917
- so now...
- Now,

01:02:53.292 --> 01:02:55.251
we go after Cho.

01:02:59.167 --> 01:03:01.251
I'm already on it.

01:03:03.876 --> 01:03:05.876
Let me know when you're ready.

01:03:09.459 --> 01:03:10.709
Want one?

01:03:27.167 --> 01:03:29.876
I'm dying to know what you look like.

01:03:31.751 --> 01:03:33.751
You'll find out soon enough.

01:03:34.459 --> 01:03:37.209
I hope you like it.

01:03:38.876 --> 01:03:40.917
If there's validity to that tip,

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:42.876
shouldn't we get the intelligence?

01:03:43.126 --> 01:03:44.709
We wouldn't be enough.

01:03:44.709 --> 01:03:47.292
They'll bring a warrant
to the immigration office.

01:03:50.084 --> 01:03:52.209
Did you send the warrant?

01:03:52.751 --> 01:03:54.459
Yeah, I just sent it.

01:04:09.292 --> 01:04:11.501
How did you know Cho was hiding here?

01:04:11.959 --> 01:04:13.667
You're very forthcoming.

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:58.501
This is a raid from the immigration office!

01:07:04.834 --> 01:07:06.209
Hurry! Hurry!

01:07:08.709 --> 01:07:09.792
Move it!

01:07:20.959 --> 01:07:23.001
This should be a death sentence for Cho.

01:07:43.417 --> 01:07:44.834
Know how to use it?

01:11:33.959 --> 01:11:38.167
Our contract ends here,
so we don't need to meet.

01:11:39.917 --> 01:11:42.209
Casino accountants can settle the rest.

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:47.167
Do you hate me that much?

01:11:48.542 --> 01:11:50.542
Did you think I'd like you?

01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:54.709
That face, and how should I put it,

01:11:55.917 --> 01:11:57.751
you feel like my imitation.

01:11:58.626 --> 01:12:00.626
A stalker, maybe?

01:12:01.042 --> 01:12:04.626
Or did you get close to me for a story?

01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:07.542
I heard you changed your name.

01:12:10.459 --> 01:12:12.501
I'm your imitation?

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:19.792
Stop wasting our time,

01:12:20.751 --> 01:12:23.292
if you mimic me again, I won't let you breathe.

01:12:24.001 --> 01:12:27.376
And don't come near my woman.

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:43.334
When did you start using?

01:13:46.334 --> 01:13:48.334
Did you go through my locker?

01:13:49.584 --> 01:13:52.917
It's a synthetic drug, side effect is terrible.

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:17.917
My woman was raped.

01:15:07.834 --> 01:15:11.251
1, 2, 3.

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:17.167
Siesta, its effects will be felt in 7 seconds.

01:15:18.126 --> 01:15:22.292
Fishy taste will roam in the mouth,
and hallucination will be felt.

01:15:27.042 --> 01:15:31.001
With lower body temperature,
memory loss can be prevented.

01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:38.292
This is documentation for my report.

01:15:40.084 --> 01:15:42.084
Documentation for my report.

01:15:44.792 --> 01:15:47.459
I can conquer myself.

01:15:56.667 --> 01:15:58.084
This is...

01:16:00.292 --> 01:16:02.542
documentation for my report.

01:16:04.792 --> 01:16:11.042
I can...conquer myself.

01:16:42.834 --> 01:16:44.501
(Choi Nak-hyun)

01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:45.834
(Cho Won-geun)

01:16:58.376 --> 01:16:59.459
(Prof. Kim?)

01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:12.876
Oh, and...

01:17:16.001 --> 01:17:17.001
this too.

01:18:25.459 --> 01:18:26.751
How is it?

01:18:30.751 --> 01:18:32.459
Is it the face you wanted?

01:18:55.417 --> 01:18:58.376
Like something out of a movie,

01:18:58.501 --> 01:19:02.501
a domestic mob was caught for producing

01:19:02.501 --> 01:19:05.334
and distributing illicit drugs.

01:19:05.792 --> 01:19:11.876
Seoul Prosecution Office called for
immediate arrest of the mob boss

01:19:11.876 --> 01:19:14.959
and his henchmen for distributing
a large quantity of cocaine...

01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:18.417
A lot of suits upstairs will
get the axe over that.

01:19:18.792 --> 01:19:19.917
But I'm good.

01:19:22.376 --> 01:19:26.209
How did they know the exact location?

01:19:28.584 --> 01:19:31.126
Who helped you to go after Cho?

01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:34.126
He's a Russian businessman,

01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:39.876
Sergei, he's a Korean-Russian.

01:19:40.667 --> 01:19:42.251
I'll introduce you.

01:19:42.251 --> 01:19:43.334
Sergei...

01:19:48.792 --> 01:19:53.709
This case was investigated for many years
by our station's reportage freelancer

01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:56.917
Jang Tae-young, who was
instrumental in the arrest...

01:19:56.917 --> 01:20:01.667
Having investigated violent,
and drug crimes for many years,

01:20:02.251 --> 01:20:08.292
I realized that the addicts of these crimes
were the real monsters.

01:20:08.876 --> 01:20:14.959
The woman I love went missing due to this case.

01:20:17.459 --> 01:20:22.792
It's been 3 years but I will not give up.

01:20:24.251 --> 01:20:28.834
I don't know if he's here,
but I'd also like to thank

01:20:28.834 --> 01:20:34.584
my partner-in-crime Det.
Noh Yum for this honor.

01:20:34.917 --> 01:20:36.126
Thank you.

01:20:53.292 --> 01:20:54.626
It's been a while.

01:20:55.042 --> 01:20:56.501
Thank you for coming.

01:20:56.501 --> 01:20:58.209
Thank you for the invite.

01:20:58.959 --> 01:21:00.542
Love the game, right?

01:21:00.792 --> 01:21:02.751
We opened this VIP room.

01:21:03.834 --> 01:21:06.709
Do I look like a leader now?

01:21:07.251 --> 01:21:08.626
Congratulations.

01:21:12.626 --> 01:21:17.167
There's someone who's trying to mimic me,

01:21:18.501 --> 01:21:20.501
what kind of condition is that?

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:25.501
It's called Giovannini Mirror Syndrome,

01:21:26.626 --> 01:21:31.667
one mimics mannerism and
habits of those around him.

01:21:32.209 --> 01:21:37.209
It feels appalling,
like out-of-body experience.

01:21:39.542 --> 01:21:43.251
I don't think this is something
I can help with.

01:21:43.917 --> 01:21:48.167
Making someone disappear
in real life is your specialty.

01:21:48.334 --> 01:21:50.292
That's quite creepy.

01:22:03.917 --> 01:22:04.959
Take care.

01:22:20.667 --> 01:22:22.334
What's so funny?

01:22:35.209 --> 01:22:37.792
It was awkward since we're the same.

01:22:47.417 --> 01:22:50.459
I said I'll kill you if you mimic me again.

01:22:58.084 --> 01:23:01.792
Ever think that you're the one mimicking me?

01:23:05.751 --> 01:23:08.292
You better leave right now.

01:23:08.959 --> 01:23:10.334
Why should I?

01:23:10.584 --> 01:23:14.126
Don't forget, I own half of this.

01:23:16.626 --> 01:23:17.792
What?

01:23:18.417 --> 01:23:21.001
You better just enjoy this.

01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:26.584
Shall we toast?

01:23:31.209 --> 01:23:32.876
Raise your glass.

01:23:34.251 --> 01:23:35.709
Cheers, everyone.

01:23:35.751 --> 01:23:37.334
Goddammit!

01:23:49.584 --> 01:23:51.584
A drink would be nice.

01:24:11.792 --> 01:24:13.209
Old man,

01:24:13.417 --> 01:24:15.626
give yourself up and get a private cell.

01:24:15.626 --> 01:24:17.959
I'll bring some Beggar's Chicken.

01:24:18.167 --> 01:24:20.084
Who wants to bury me?

01:24:20.626 --> 01:24:22.542
You don't even suspect me?

01:24:23.167 --> 01:24:24.626
You like me.

01:24:26.459 --> 01:24:29.667
Tell me which Russian was behind it.

01:24:30.292 --> 01:24:32.917
If that reporter testifies, you're dead.

01:24:33.626 --> 01:24:36.042
If you want to live, you'll have to help me.

01:24:37.626 --> 01:24:38.751
After the party,

01:24:38.751 --> 01:24:41.959
I could get the reporter to go
wherever you want.

01:24:42.417 --> 01:24:44.167
Isn't that enough?

01:24:48.001 --> 01:24:49.626
Hey, listen.

01:24:51.417 --> 01:24:53.709
Where did you see the man with the same tattoo?

01:24:55.042 --> 01:24:56.459
I'll call back.

01:25:03.876 --> 01:25:08.959
It's been too long, you feel like a stranger.

01:25:13.292 --> 01:25:15.751
How are these missing person cases related?

01:25:16.334 --> 01:25:20.126
They were the addicts
of the drug we've been after.

01:25:20.876 --> 01:25:23.917
The truth will come out when Cho is caught.

01:25:26.459 --> 01:25:31.042
The one who worked under Cho
was Prof. Kim's right-hand man.

01:25:31.667 --> 01:25:37.251
Prof. Kim is Cho's hostile rival drug dealer.

01:25:38.459 --> 01:25:40.292
No, Russian mafia to be precise.

01:25:40.542 --> 01:25:42.126
Real name is Sergei.

01:25:42.667 --> 01:25:43.792
Evidence?

01:25:44.084 --> 01:25:46.709
He's in the country right now.

01:25:48.084 --> 01:25:49.209
Come with me.

01:25:49.209 --> 01:25:50.542
Let's dig together.

01:28:09.042 --> 01:28:13.917
1, 2, 3, 4...

01:28:13.917 --> 01:28:15.334
Crazy bastard...

01:28:15.334 --> 01:28:17.376
5, 6

01:28:18.417 --> 01:28:19.751
7

01:29:34.792 --> 01:29:36.042
Did you...

01:29:37.334 --> 01:29:38.751
give me drugs?

01:29:39.834 --> 01:29:41.834
Feels good, doesn't it?

01:29:42.209 --> 01:29:43.209
What?

01:29:44.417 --> 01:29:49.126
Crippled a town bully and went to the juvie,

01:29:49.459 --> 01:29:51.167
did you really do that?

01:29:51.167 --> 01:29:52.834
Wanna hear the truth?

01:29:52.834 --> 01:29:57.167
You went to a regular school,
and a model student at that.

01:29:58.001 --> 01:30:01.126
A crazy bitch bit off your nipple?

01:30:03.959 --> 01:30:07.334
You actually got hurt while on a case.

01:30:09.751 --> 01:30:11.417
You knew, didn't you?

01:30:13.001 --> 01:30:14.917
That you're my imitation.

01:30:14.917 --> 01:30:16.251
Shut up!

01:30:17.542 --> 01:30:22.167
You became an addict 3 years ago
while chasing the drug.

01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:26.751
So you emerged from me to play a gangster.

01:30:28.126 --> 01:30:32.167
Do you know how old you are?

01:30:33.667 --> 01:30:35.417
3 years old.

01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:42.251
My woman was raped.

01:30:43.001 --> 01:30:44.001
Buddy!

01:30:44.376 --> 01:30:46.376
You never had a woman.

01:30:49.459 --> 01:30:53.876
How dare you try to kill the real thing?

01:30:56.542 --> 01:30:58.126
You cannot become me.

01:30:58.542 --> 01:31:00.292
But I can though.

01:31:02.167 --> 01:31:04.751
Mimicking isn't good enough.

01:31:05.167 --> 01:31:06.751
Everything is inside me,

01:31:06.751 --> 01:31:08.542
it's all mine!

01:31:18.876 --> 01:31:20.501
I'm real.

01:32:40.542 --> 01:32:41.709
Yoo-hwa.

01:33:05.292 --> 01:33:07.292
Where's the next party?

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:19.042
Party?

01:34:07.334 --> 01:34:09.584
Buying drugs on the streets?

01:34:10.584 --> 01:34:12.334
Why Can't you quit?

01:34:13.542 --> 01:34:15.542
What does it matter to you?

01:34:17.084 --> 01:34:18.542
You're a fake.

01:34:22.876 --> 01:34:24.001
No.

01:34:27.209 --> 01:34:30.459
I'm someone who loves you,
despite knowing the truth.

01:34:33.751 --> 01:34:35.417
I'm your real.

01:34:45.626 --> 01:34:52.042
Do you know why you love
a schizophrenic 3-year old?

01:34:56.459 --> 01:35:00.667
Because he's an ego derived
from wanting to quit drugs.

01:35:02.834 --> 01:35:04.834
Don't be like him.

01:35:05.917 --> 01:35:07.501
Conquer it.

01:35:08.334 --> 01:35:09.626
Like me.

01:35:47.709 --> 01:35:48.584
Get out!

01:36:30.126 --> 01:36:32.126
Get up, get up!

01:36:37.834 --> 01:36:43.251
You want to call it even for
killing that fucking reporter?

01:36:44.876 --> 01:36:49.417
Find out who came after me and bring him to me.

01:36:50.417 --> 01:36:53.376
Or she's dead.

01:37:53.084 --> 01:37:56.876
(Det. Noh Yum)

01:38:28.792 --> 01:38:30.959
(3 months later)

01:39:48.459 --> 01:39:49.542
Baek.

01:39:51.126 --> 01:39:52.417
Baek Jong-go.

01:40:13.542 --> 01:40:14.876
Tae-young,

01:40:14.876 --> 01:40:17.876
stop pressuring the Russians, they're partners.

01:40:20.209 --> 01:40:22.126
You're embarrassing me.

01:40:30.209 --> 01:40:32.709
She's been kidnapped for 3 months,

01:40:34.834 --> 01:40:37.084
it's unlikely that she's still alive.

01:40:40.876 --> 01:40:42.626
She's alive.

01:40:45.001 --> 01:40:47.001
How can I help you then?

01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:50.084
Hand Ryu Kil-su over to Cho.

01:40:50.792 --> 01:40:55.126
Planting Ryu in his mob was
the source of trouble.

01:40:57.042 --> 01:40:58.792
That may be difficult.

01:41:07.459 --> 01:41:10.751
If you don't want to lose all
and flee to Russia,

01:41:10.876 --> 01:41:13.251
you better produce him.

01:41:19.209 --> 01:41:20.792
Where's the bastard?

01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:23.542
I'll help you up to here.

01:41:24.376 --> 01:41:26.376
I can't do anything more.

01:41:28.001 --> 01:41:29.917
Be careful.

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:52.042
You came back after greenlighting me?

01:41:53.459 --> 01:41:55.084
I know Cho,

01:41:56.001 --> 01:41:59.626
let me contact him, I'll get it done.

01:41:59.876 --> 01:42:03.084
She's mine, I'll take care of it.

01:42:05.334 --> 01:42:09.209
If you come back, I will kill you.

01:42:47.626 --> 01:42:49.084
Tae-young.

01:42:50.001 --> 01:42:51.834
Stay out of this case.

01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:54.709
It's my work.

01:43:16.792 --> 01:43:20.292
(Euphoria That Changed the World)

01:44:09.542 --> 01:44:11.251
Who have you brought?

01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:28.209
Just a single rat?

01:44:34.542 --> 01:44:37.542
Do you really have the balls to sell me off?

01:44:38.626 --> 01:44:40.292
Who do you work for?

01:44:42.001 --> 01:44:43.376
Sergei...

01:44:46.501 --> 01:44:47.834
Kil-su,

01:44:48.376 --> 01:44:50.126
look at my eyes.

01:44:53.334 --> 01:44:55.126
You know me well.

01:44:59.501 --> 01:45:02.584
Boris...Boris...

01:45:12.584 --> 01:45:14.001
Where's the girl?

01:45:22.084 --> 01:45:24.459
You feel different.

01:45:25.292 --> 01:45:27.292
Talks like a douche,

01:45:28.167 --> 01:45:29.709
you're a different man.

01:45:47.792 --> 01:45:50.459
What's with this faggot outfit?

01:45:54.292 --> 01:45:55.834
Boris...

01:45:59.417 --> 01:46:01.917
Bring me Boris right away.

01:46:34.751 --> 01:46:36.167
Did you bring it?

01:46:41.001 --> 01:46:43.167
Walther PPQ Striker,

01:46:44.417 --> 01:46:47.292
it's the best polymer pistol.

01:46:52.917 --> 01:46:54.917
Next up, Sergei Kim.

01:46:55.584 --> 01:46:58.417
He was an infamous character.

01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:06.959
I assigned a 24-hour bodyguard to you.

01:47:07.917 --> 01:47:10.501
Former Spetsnaz officer and mafia enforcer,

01:47:10.501 --> 01:47:13.376
and known as Prof. Kim.

01:50:33.001 --> 01:50:35.459
(Det. Noh: 2 New Messages)

01:51:12.209 --> 01:51:13.459
Who are you?

01:51:59.959 --> 01:52:01.459
So you're real,

01:52:01.459 --> 01:52:04.709
and the one I dealt with is a fake?

01:52:18.042 --> 01:52:19.042
Fucker.

01:52:20.334 --> 01:52:21.792
You're confusing me.

01:52:26.251 --> 01:52:27.417
Hello?

01:52:28.751 --> 01:52:30.417
Let me ask you something.

01:52:31.417 --> 01:52:34.417
What's my favorite dish?

01:52:41.417 --> 01:52:43.251
You shot the wrong one.

01:52:44.501 --> 01:52:46.667
I know I shot the writer.

01:52:48.167 --> 01:52:50.876
Fuck, I'm so confused.

01:52:52.417 --> 01:52:54.042
Where's the girl?

01:53:26.292 --> 01:53:27.542
Sergei...

01:53:28.459 --> 01:53:31.126
Boris, know them?

01:53:33.417 --> 01:53:35.917
Let's start with Sergei.

01:53:36.584 --> 01:53:39.001
He's working with that reporter.

01:53:45.959 --> 01:53:49.959
Kill anyone who gets in the way!

01:53:50.167 --> 01:53:53.792
Kill anyone who hurts me!

01:54:21.959 --> 01:54:23.126
Hey, councilor.

01:54:23.126 --> 01:54:24.542
Who's Boris?

01:54:24.542 --> 01:54:25.876
Answer me.

01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:37.251
(Boris)

01:54:38.417 --> 01:54:39.834
This Siesta...

01:54:42.876 --> 01:54:44.667
Fucking amazing.

01:54:50.584 --> 01:54:53.584
You asked about a man with the same tattoo.

01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:56.209
It's my family doctor.

01:54:56.459 --> 01:54:59.042
He's safely guarding your woman.

01:55:01.001 --> 01:55:03.834
(Lawyer: Boris Rognof, Choi Jin-ki)

01:55:39.209 --> 01:55:41.001
So you're Boris?

01:55:42.334 --> 01:55:45.501
No, I'm not Boris.

01:55:46.584 --> 01:55:49.626
Just a doctor, who develops new meds.

01:55:51.542 --> 01:55:53.084
Drugs, you mean.

01:55:56.251 --> 01:56:00.292
So the meds you got while here were drugs?

01:56:00.959 --> 01:56:03.667
Did you take them to get high?

01:56:03.959 --> 01:56:05.084
No.

01:56:06.376 --> 01:56:08.376
You received salvation.

01:56:09.126 --> 01:56:11.917
See? You are reborn.

01:56:54.667 --> 01:56:55.876
Siesta.

01:56:57.001 --> 01:56:59.459
This gave you a new life.

01:56:59.792 --> 01:57:03.709
Depending on how it's used,
it could save or kill a man.

01:57:05.167 --> 01:57:07.751
Siesta, it means "nap."

01:57:09.667 --> 01:57:11.001
Isn't it funny?

01:57:12.584 --> 01:57:16.292
Even in vegetative state, you were an addict.

01:57:16.834 --> 01:57:20.417
To survive the addiction,
you created a new ego,

01:57:20.417 --> 01:57:23.917
and used it to witness your own survival.

01:57:23.917 --> 01:57:25.792
That was intriguing.

01:57:26.542 --> 01:57:29.334
Then something interesting happened.

01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:34.042
The new ego that was created
to exist in painful hell,

01:57:34.584 --> 01:57:38.709
went to you, who was suicidal.

01:57:39.917 --> 01:57:42.542
Coincidence? Fate?

01:57:44.042 --> 01:57:47.459
Existing in a shell, like a ghost,

01:57:47.834 --> 01:57:54.417
you latched onto the ego, like this magnet.

01:58:04.376 --> 01:58:06.084
Where's Yoo-hwa?

01:58:12.167 --> 01:58:13.167
Right here,

01:58:14.459 --> 01:58:17.792
but the person who left her
didn't say she was 3-month pregnant.

01:58:20.209 --> 01:58:23.251
She's a filthy rat, who stole painkillers.

01:58:23.459 --> 01:58:26.042
She was already a Siesta addict.

01:58:33.126 --> 01:58:36.667
The only ones who got over
Siesta's addiction are you, me,

01:58:37.167 --> 01:58:39.459
and Jang Tae-young.

01:58:41.959 --> 01:58:44.167
You see what's real by losing everything.

01:58:44.251 --> 01:58:47.792
When we become addicted to it,
you'll find the real you.

01:58:48.084 --> 01:58:52.334
Die off, or the survival instinct
brings out the real you, like Jang.

01:58:52.542 --> 01:58:54.167
We'll all die.

01:58:54.167 --> 01:58:58.501
Once balance is lost,
even bigger balance is achieved.

02:00:05.001 --> 02:00:07.001
It's okay, it's okay.
