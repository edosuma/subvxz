00:01.085 --> 00:02.245
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.462 --> 00:04.669
Hello, Sean.
I just killed your family.

00:04.881 --> 00:06.291
Lydia wrole these?

00:06.507 --> 00:07.963
You got kicked out, didn't you?

00:08.176 --> 00:09.712
That's good. You kissed her.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.338
Gel back!

00:12.722 --> 00:14.587
When you take the bite of an innocent,

00:14.765 --> 00:17.142
I will come knocking at your door.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.247
Hey, let's get everyone off the root.

00:41.459 --> 00:43.871
And see if you can
stall the ME for five minutes.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.372
I've got an expert of my own
coming to take a look.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.670
You have an expert
on teenage cannibals?

00:50.051 --> 00:51.541
Five minutes, Parrish.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.218
Hey.

01:07.944 --> 01:09.480
I guess you've
been there long enough

01:09.695 --> 01:11.856
to hear that we need
to be quick about this.

01:12.031 --> 01:14.738
Scott said he caught himself
a wendigo.

01:17.495 --> 01:20.532
But I haven't heard
of them in Beacon Hills for a long time.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.700
Must have been well-hidden.

01:27.922 --> 01:30.254
How many people
did Scott say were up here?

01:30.466 --> 01:34.880
Just Sean and the axe murderer,
who apparently has no mouth.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.255
You wouldn't
know anything about that, would you?

01:39.225 --> 01:40.806
There WCIS someone else.

01:41.811 --> 01:43.847
Someone young. And male.

01:44.814 --> 01:46.304
You can smell his fear?

01:49.235 --> 01:50.691
And his blood.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.029
Like I said,
I told my dad everything I could.

01:55.199 --> 01:57.736
- But you didn't tell him about Liam?
- You barely told me about Liam.

01:57.952 --> 02:01.069
- What did you do with him anyway?
- He's upstairs.

02:01.539 --> 02:02.654
Doing what?

02:05.626 --> 02:06.706
Lying down.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.514
- So you bit him.
- Yeah.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.804
- And you kidnapped him.
- Yeah.

02:29.025 --> 02:31.437
- And then you brought him here.
- | panicked.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.641
Yup.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.061
This isn't going to end
with us burying the pieces of his body

02:36.240 --> 02:37.696
out in the desert, is it?

02:40.911 --> 02:42.822
As a reminder, this is why
I always come up with the plans.

02:43.039 --> 02:45.075
- Your plans suck.
- I know.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.827
Which is why I called you.

02:47.877 --> 02:49.037
So, what do we do?

02:54.925 --> 02:57.587
Liam, we're going
to take the tape off your mouth.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.589
If you scream, it goes right back on.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.091
If you talk quietly, it stays oft. Got it?

03:04.810 --> 03:05.765
Okay.

03:11.192 --> 03:13.683
Okay, Liam, now you've seen a
lot of confusing things tonight.

03:13.903 --> 03:15.564
And more confusing things
are going to happen

03:15.780 --> 03:17.065
because of the confusing things
that happened tonight.

03:17.281 --> 03:18.782
Do you understand?

03:20.159 --> 03:21.239
Not really.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.363
- Good. That's good.
- I don't understand either.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.410
Maybe you should tell him.

03:26.499 --> 03:27.830
Tell me what?

03:28.292 --> 03:29.327
Liam...

03:29.919 --> 03:31.875
What happened to you,
what I did to you,

03:32.088 --> 03:34.079
which I had to do in order to save you,

03:35.424 --> 03:38.131
- it's going to change you.
- Unless it kills you.

03:39.929 --> 03:41.419
Shouldn't have said that.

03:42.473 --> 03:43.553
What?

03:44.600 --> 03:45.760
Uh...

03:46.644 --> 03:48.009
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.560
Is he... Is he crying?

03:51.065 --> 03:53.602
Liam, it's okay.
You're going to be all right.

03:53.818 --> 03:55.479
You're not going to die.

03:55.695 --> 03:56.901
- Probably not.
- Stop it.

03:57.113 --> 03:58.398
Okay, possibly not.

03:58.614 --> 04:00.696
- Would you just help me untie him?
- Yep.

04:04.453 --> 04:05.568
Liam, are you okay?

04:05.871 --> 04:08.408
We're sorry about that.
We're really sorry.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.248
Liam, what the hell is your...

04:26.934 --> 04:27.923
Get him!

04:38.988 --> 04:40.398
Leg! I got him!

04:41.115 --> 04:43.982
I got him, I got him! I got him.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.413
Your plan sucked, too.

05:01.677 --> 05:03.213
Derek, you here?

05:08.225 --> 05:09.305
Derek!

05:26.118 --> 05:27.233
Derek...

05:29.038 --> 05:30.744
Don't worry, Peter.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.747
Derek is next.

06:15.334 --> 06:16.574
I hate full moons.

06:16.794 --> 06:18.330
It's going to get easier. I promise.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.997
It better.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.920
Because this isn't going
to hold much longer.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.509
Well, then let's try to make tonight
the last time we have to use these.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.379
Besides, we might need them for Liam.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.965
You guys sure he's going
to turn into a werewolf?

06:29.181 --> 06:30.967
We're not even sure
if he's going to live.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.222
- Is that too tight?
- No.

06:38.691 --> 06:40.556
Hey. Um...

06:41.151 --> 06:43.938
That's...
This is not what you think at all.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.860
I don't even want to know.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.485
There's nothing to know, 'cause Ijust...

06:53.122 --> 06:54.487
I don't get it.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.163
Told him that.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.044
These are your math notes?

07:05.217 --> 07:06.957
No wonder Malia's failing.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.088
Um, some of them are my notes.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.508
The rest I think
might actually be a code.

07:11.724 --> 07:13.715
But you don't remember writing it?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.174
Not in the slightest.

07:15.394 --> 07:18.636
But considering my drawing
of a tree led us to the Nemeton,

07:18.856 --> 07:22.144
I should probably figure out
what it means before it tries to kill us.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.438
Maybe it's like the
Enigma Code the Allies used.

07:25.654 --> 07:29.738
Remember my dad was a World War II
buff? And my mom was, well, in it.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.613
I think this is a variation on something
called the Vigenere Cipher.

07:33.829 --> 07:36.662
- Do you know how to crack it?
- With a key.

07:40.711 --> 07:41.917
Remember the rules.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.040
No more than
six people allowed in the lake house.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.837
Stay out of the wine.

07:46.050 --> 07:49.292
And if anything gets broken,
it's getting added to your credit card debt.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.464
Fine.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.262
And lock up the basement.

07:53.474 --> 07:54.839
From all the scratch marks
I found on the walls,

07:55.059 --> 07:57.425
it looked like a pack
of wild animals got down there.

08:07.112 --> 08:10.229
I'm not watching
another movie on a Friday night.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.364
Mason, there's gotta be
something going on.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.442
You remember we're freshmen, right?

08:15.621 --> 08:17.077
We just got off a school bus.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.780
We're not exactly gonna be
hitting the clubs till 4:00 am.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.456
Okay. Movie at your place. 9200.

08:28.217 --> 08:30.458
Hey.
Liam, why weren't you on the bus?

08:31.720 --> 08:32.880
I ran.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.013
You ran three miles to school?

08:37.601 --> 08:40.308
- Ijust started running.
- I guess your leg's okay?

08:42.147 --> 08:43.887
What happened to your arm?

09:01.667 --> 09:03.203
Dude, are you okay?

09:11.510 --> 09:13.466
I'll talk to you later.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.260
I gotta get to class.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.477
- Liam, hey!
- We need to talk.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.520
No, you need to back
the hell up, okay? Both of you.

09:33.699 --> 09:36.862
Can you just listen
for one second. Please?

09:43.375 --> 09:44.581
Liam...

09:46.795 --> 09:48.126
We're brothers now.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.706
- What?
- Oh, God. That's...

09:51.925 --> 09:55.338
What are you talking about?
We just met and you bit me.

09:55.554 --> 09:56.964
The bite...

09:57.431 --> 09:59.262
The bite is a gift.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.015
Scott, stop. Please stop.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.718
You, you, we're trying
to help you, you little runt.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.682
By kidnapping me?

10:06.899 --> 10:09.481
Just to clarify,
Scott kidnapped you. Okay?

10:09.693 --> 10:12.070
| aided and abetted.

10:13.489 --> 10:15.946
Liam, I've gone through this before.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.025
Something's happening to you.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.322
Something big.

10:22.915 --> 10:24.371
Nothing's happening to me.

10:26.794 --> 10:27.829
Nothing.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.432
- I'm not sharing my basement.
- Actually, it's my basement.

10:44.645 --> 10:47.136
And my mom
noticed how you fore it up last time.

10:47.356 --> 10:48.812
All right, she's still learning.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.643
But we're going to use
the boathouse for Liam.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.558
It's got support beams.
We can chain him to one of them.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.647
But how do we get him out to
the lake house if he doesn't trust us?

10:54.822 --> 10:56.437
I say if it keeps him
from murdering someone,

10:56.615 --> 10:58.606
we just chloroform the little bastard
and throw him in the lake.

10:58.784 --> 11:01.992
- I'm in.
- We're not killing or kidnapping him.

11:02.204 --> 11:05.196
Then let's be smarter.
We tell him there's a party and invite him.

11:06.208 --> 11:09.325
- So, you're going to ask out a freshman?
- No, I'm done with teenage boys.

11:09.545 --> 11:12.207
But, if we're playing a trick on someone,

11:12.422 --> 11:14.378
we'll have to use the trickster.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.126
Who? Me? No way.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.586
- Not me.
- Yes, you.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.050
You know what they call a female fox?

11:23.267 --> 11:25.474
- A vixen.
- Me?

11:26.520 --> 11:28.056
You can do it, Kira.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.395
Be a vixen.

11:38.282 --> 11:39.317
Liam.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.278
Liam.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.634
Are you okay?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.979
Yeah.ﬁne.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.398
You want to go to a party tonight?

12:22.117 --> 12:23.857
The axe was laced with wolfsbane.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.786
I don't know the species,
so I'm going to have to burn it out.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.577
I think I can handle a little fire.

12:36.048 --> 12:37.663
Oh, hell.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.064
He said he was after you.

12:57.319 --> 12:59.776
How does a guy with no mouth
say anything?

13:02.908 --> 13:04.193
With this.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.575
It's Lydia Martin's lake house.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.252
Actually,
it's her grandmother's lake house.

13:17.422 --> 13:18.923
But she's dead, so it's okay.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.668
I mean,
it's not okay that she's dead.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.333
Unless she was in pain.

13:24.096 --> 13:25.552
Can you turn the music down?

13:29.393 --> 13:31.008
You want me to turn the music up?

13:43.991 --> 13:45.777
Who'd you say
was coming to this party?

13:46.785 --> 13:48.901
Um... Everyone.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.874
Ijust talked to Kira. She's on her way.
She said it's all going fine.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.835
No, it's not that.
l have to tell you something.

14:03.385 --> 14:06.969
| asked around about Liam. I know why
he got kicked out of his last school.

14:07.639 --> 14:08.970
This is going to be bad, isn't it?

14:09.141 --> 14:12.599
He kind of got into it
with one of his teachers. And...

14:12.811 --> 14:15.097
The kid's got
some serious anger issues.

14:15.314 --> 14:16.429
How serious?

14:16.648 --> 14:19.105
Well, that's his teacher's car.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.559
After he took a crowbar to it.

14:56.355 --> 14:59.813
- Where is everyone?
- They're here. It's a small party.

15:00.025 --> 15:02.562
You said everyone was coming.

15:02.778 --> 15:05.235
They are. They're late.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.862
And we're early. So we better hurry.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.900
Yay! Party.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.243
Sorry.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.089
What the hell is this?

15:26.301 --> 15:29.759
Think of it like an intervention.
You have a problem, Liam.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.428
And we're the only ones that can help.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.511
I still don't get
how this guy has no mouth.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.767
I mean, how can he eat?

15:42.526 --> 15:44.357
Peter didn't get a chance to ask.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.060
He was fighting him off
with a tomahawk buried in his chest.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.737
Yeah, and who runs around
with a tomahawk?

15:50.784 --> 15:53.196
I carried one
for IED removal in Afghanistan.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.654
It's military. And so is that.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.580
Do you know what it's used for?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.783
Well, this one
looks like it's been modified.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.125
Show us.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.504
Werewolf?

16:14.724 --> 16:15.975
Werecoyote.

16:16.435 --> 16:18.016
Banshee.

16:20.564 --> 16:21.679
Fox?

16:21.898 --> 16:23.980
Kitsune.
But fox works.

16:25.569 --> 16:26.649
What are you?

16:27.237 --> 16:30.525
Uh, for a little while,
I was possessed by an evil spirit.

16:30.740 --> 16:31.946
It was very evil.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.160
What are you now?

16:35.745 --> 16:37.246
Better. Um...

16:39.791 --> 16:41.247
Are those for me?

16:43.462 --> 16:45.077
No, they're for me.

16:49.426 --> 16:51.917
- How did you do that?
- You'll learn.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.048
But first, you need to
get through the full moon.

16:54.431 --> 16:55.921
The moon's already out.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.633
And you're starting
to feel something, aren't you?

16:59.853 --> 17:02.595
I feel like I'm surrounded
by a bunch of psychotic nutjobs.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.725
You guys are
out of your freaking minds.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.603
I don't know how you
did that eye thing and I don't care.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.605
I'm walking out the door right now!

17:09.821 --> 17:13.405
If any of you try to stop me,
I swear to God, I'm gonna...

17:20.499 --> 17:21.579
What's wrong, Liam?

17:21.833 --> 17:22.993
You don't hear that?

17:29.174 --> 17:30.960
Did you tell someone about this?

17:31.176 --> 17:32.757
My friend Mason.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.180
You said it was a party.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.550
- Who did Mason invite?
- Everyone.

17:40.769 --> 17:42.509
The floors! Get him off the floors!

17:44.397 --> 17:46.137
We need to get him
to the boathouse now!

17:49.569 --> 17:50.945
- Stiles...
- Yeah.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.029
Hey... Okay, basement. Now. Now.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.358
What am I supposed to do with
the hordes gathering outside the door?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.784
Lydia, who throws
the best parties in Beacon Hills?

18:00.247 --> 18:03.114
What? Me, obviously.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.289
Okay, then throw a party.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.177
Hey.
Uh, are we in the right place?

18:21.393 --> 18:23.008
For the party?

18:25.605 --> 18:26.845
Absolutely.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.571
Okay, I think I got an IP address.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.778
That means we can find him, right?

18:42.998 --> 18:45.034
Definitely. Especially if...

18:47.210 --> 18:48.620
What was that?

18:50.005 --> 18:51.620
I think I found a message.

18:52.215 --> 18:54.752
Does anyone recognize
the handle "Benefactor"?

18:56.136 --> 18:58.422
Money transferred.
What does that mean?

19:01.308 --> 19:03.219
That means this guy is notjust a killer.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.973
He's an assassin.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.945
I got him. Get his hands.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.538
Oh, God. I didn't kill him, did I?

19:37.302 --> 19:39.839
No. He's out cold.

19:42.432 --> 19:44.218
I hope Stiles is having better luck.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.261
Too tight?

19:50.607 --> 19:51.938
Tighter.

20:03.286 --> 20:06.073
- You could leave if you want.
- I'm not going anywhere.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.746
And to be honest,
I'm probably safer down here

20:08.917 --> 20:11.954
than in a party with 50 freshmen
and a very pissed off Lydia.

20:25.767 --> 20:28.509
Okay, I didn't order a keg of beer.

20:29.187 --> 20:31.519
- Especially not domestic.
- Somebody ordered it.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.022
Are you trying to tell me
no one here wants to drink?

20:36.528 --> 20:38.018
Who put this here?

20:38.780 --> 20:40.862
This laptop is $2,000 and...

20:41.074 --> 20:43.781
Oh, that bottle of wine is 400.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.869
How much?

20:52.085 --> 20:53.416
What's this extra hundred dollars?

20:53.628 --> 20:57.166
I call that the
"Yes, you do look 21 to me" surcharge.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.675
Let me get you some cash.

21:06.307 --> 21:09.549
I opened the wine.
I should probably pay for the keg.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.440
He looks so young.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.110
He is.
He's only 15.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.576
What are we going to do with him?

21:27.704 --> 21:29.035
We're going to help him.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.459
What if he doesn't want our help?

21:36.129 --> 21:37.460
He will.

21:46.681 --> 21:48.296
Stiles, please go.

21:49.267 --> 21:52.179
It's okay. I hate parties.
It's a social anxiety thing.

21:53.438 --> 21:55.929
- You ever had a panic attack?
- I'm having one now.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.603
Just breathe, okay.
I'm not going to leave you.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.025
What if I hurt you?

22:01.613 --> 22:03.854
- You're not going to.
- But I want to.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.655
I look at your face
and I want to slash at it.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.108
I want to fear at it.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.570
I want to feel your bones
crack between my hands.

22:11.790 --> 22:14.657
Surprisingly enough, you're not the first
person to ever say something like that.

22:16.294 --> 22:17.454
I'm not leaving you.

22:18.213 --> 22:19.999
And I'm not going to
let you hurt anyone.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.682
You're not going to have a choice.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.273
Oh, come on.
You got to be kidding me.

22:43.279 --> 22:44.985
Son of a bitch.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.438
Son of a...

23:00.296 --> 23:02.082
Three things cannot be long hidden.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.550
The sun, the moon, the truth.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.374
Three things cannot be long hidden.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.926
The sun, the moon, the truth.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.924
Three things cannot be long hidden.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.841
The sun, the moon, the truth.

23:15.478 --> 23:18.390
The sun, the moon, the truth.

24:00.815 --> 24:03.852
- What are you smiling about?
- Our friend just sent me a text.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.165
Liam? You up here?

24:23.212 --> 24:24.827
Dude, where the hell are you?

24:31.888 --> 24:34.049
What are you doing up here?
The party's downstairs.

24:34.223 --> 24:35.884
I was looking for Liam.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.887
Sorry, but missing freshmen
are a little low on my priority list.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.355
But not so low
that you don't know he's a freshman?

24:42.732 --> 24:44.063
I might have seen your friend.

24:44.275 --> 24:45.651
Downstairs.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.228
Oh, my God, the carpet...

24:50.615 --> 24:52.025
No, God, no.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.361
Hey, it's all right. It'll come out.

24:56.621 --> 24:58.953
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.996
- Was it valuable?
- No.

25:01.209 --> 25:05.168
That's the problem.
Nothing in here's valuable.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.251
We just put the house on the market.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.632
It was supposed to
be left without a scratch.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.509
It has to be in perfect condition.

25:17.725 --> 25:20.467
We need every penny
we can get out of this place.

25:21.604 --> 25:23.720
Okay, let me go get
some club soda and salt.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.856
Lydia, it'll come out.

25:27.610 --> 25:28.770
It will.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.232
Okay.

26:31.299 --> 26:32.630
Soundproof?

28:11.482 --> 28:12.517
What?

28:13.484 --> 28:15.349
I can hear the music from the house.

28:15.570 --> 28:17.526
- What are they playing?
- Electronic.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.984
I wish they still
played slow songs at parties.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.945
At my old school,
we used to at least have a few.

28:24.245 --> 28:25.610
Why do you like the slow ones?

28:25.913 --> 28:28.199
I was always better
at slow dancing.

28:33.254 --> 28:34.289
Come here.

28:57.653 --> 28:58.938
What about him?

28:59.572 --> 29:01.233
He can dance with me next time.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.492
So how are you so good at
staying in control on a full moon?

29:12.126 --> 29:15.618
A lot of it's about making sure that my
pulse doesn't get too fast.

29:16.214 --> 29:17.920
And my heart rate doesn't go up.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.168
So you've mastered it?

29:21.594 --> 29:23.459
It still takes a lot of concentration.

29:24.972 --> 29:27.008
So if something distracts you...

29:31.270 --> 29:32.771
I'm indistractable.

29:56.379 --> 29:59.371
- Nothing.
- Then why are your eyes glowing?

30:04.762 --> 30:05.842
Cheater.

30:06.013 --> 30:08.049
I also just heard you growl.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.599
That wasn't me.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.312
Are those chains going to hold him?

30:20.528 --> 30:23.895
Uh. Yeah. I think. Definitely.

30:24.115 --> 30:25.605
He can't be that strong.

30:48.556 --> 30:51.548
Okay, Malia, I know you can hear me.
Just listen to my voice.

30:51.976 --> 30:53.341
Listen to mine.

30:56.397 --> 30:57.432
Run!

31:13.706 --> 31:17.073
You know, just because this guy
connected to the school's Wi-Fi,

31:17.293 --> 31:18.999
doesn't mean he's still here.

31:19.337 --> 31:21.703
True.
But I've seen enough in this school

31:21.922 --> 31:24.834
to keep a gun in my hand
when walking in after dark.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.802
Like blood.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.898
That doesn't make sense.

31:43.110 --> 31:45.396
- Yeah, no kidding.
- That's not what I mean.

31:46.947 --> 31:49.279
I should've caught
the scent before we walked in.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.542
Hold on.

32:02.797 --> 32:04.958
YOU nervous makes me nervous.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.243
It's an explosive.

32:34.161 --> 32:35.742
A claymore.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.990
Get down!

32:51.303 --> 32:54.545
I'm not going to run. Because
I don't think you're going to hurt me.

32:55.933 --> 32:57.969
And I think that maybe
you're so afraid of hurting me

32:58.185 --> 33:00.346
because of
what you did to your family.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.395
I know what that's like, Malia.

33:08.946 --> 33:13.064
I remember everything I did.
And the worst part is I remember liking it.

33:13.284 --> 33:16.822
Because I felt powerful.
I felt fearless.

33:18.456 --> 33:20.242
And most of all, in control.

33:21.292 --> 33:23.078
But when I came through it,

33:23.294 --> 33:25.250
I learned something else...

33:29.133 --> 33:31.624
Control is overrated.

34:09.757 --> 34:11.088
You did it.

35:00.724 --> 35:03.056
Liam... Liam, wait.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.930
- Stop.
- What did you do to me?

35:05.145 --> 35:06.806
- Liam...
- This is your fault.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.604
This is all your fault!
This is your fault!

35:33.257 --> 35:34.246
How did you know?

35:39.305 --> 35:40.841
I got your text.

36:08.876 --> 36:10.912
You have the right to remain silent.

36:12.796 --> 36:17.005
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

36:17.217 --> 36:19.253
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one...

36:19.470 --> 36:20.585
No.

36:21.597 --> 36:23.178
No, Peter, no!

37:13.524 --> 37:15.139
We've learned a better way.

37:16.694 --> 37:18.605
I'm a creature of habit.

37:25.369 --> 37:27.075
There's a clearing just north of here.

37:27.788 --> 37:30.370
All you have to do is corral him there.
The rest is taken care of.

37:31.333 --> 37:32.834
What are you going to do?

37:33.836 --> 37:35.201
He's your Beta, Scott.

37:35.421 --> 37:37.207
The better question is,
"What are you going to do?"

37:37.715 --> 37:39.251
He won't listen to me.

37:40.384 --> 37:42.545
He will if you start
using your own words.

37:45.639 --> 37:46.594
Here.

37:49.893 --> 37:50.848
Go.

38:13.751 --> 38:15.491
What's happening to me?

38:18.756 --> 38:20.621
The same thing that happened to me.

38:23.177 --> 38:25.293
Lydia? Has anyone seen Lydia?

38:34.772 --> 38:35.761
Hey.

38:35.981 --> 38:38.814
Lydia? Are you okay?

38:46.366 --> 38:47.822
What do you hear?

38:50.454 --> 38:51.694
The key.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.369
The key to break the code.

39:06.303 --> 39:08.339
They can't know about this.

39:10.891 --> 39:13.598
My mom, my stepdad,

39:16.814 --> 39:18.224
I can't do this to them again.

39:19.191 --> 39:20.806
What do you mean again?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.399
I got kicked out of school

39:27.449 --> 39:28.780
and I deserved it.

39:30.285 --> 39:34.745
The way they looked at me when they
saw what I did to that car...

39:38.085 --> 39:39.996
Liam, it's okay.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.962
They can't see me like this.

39:45.217 --> 39:46.252
Like...

39:51.682 --> 39:53.218
Like a monster?

40:06.280 --> 40:07.861
You're not a monster.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.533
You're a werewolf.

40:15.330 --> 40:16.661
Like me.

40:56.330 --> 40:57.445
What is this?

40:57.873 --> 41:00.080
It's a list of supernaturals
in Beacon Hills.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.592
And we're all on it.
