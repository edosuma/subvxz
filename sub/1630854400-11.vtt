WEBVTT

00:05.255 --> 00:05.463
.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.048
<i>- Mr. Johnson here came to our</i>
<i>country with a secret agenda,</i>

00:09.426 --> 00:11.511
<i>to secure a trade deal</i>

00:11.553 --> 00:13.930
<i>to export</i>
<i>our Gjelgjiughm coffee.</i>

00:13.972 --> 00:17.726
<i>Gjelgjiughm will never engage</i>
<i>in a coffee trade deal</i>

00:17.767 --> 00:19.394
<i>with the United States.</i>

00:21.312 --> 00:23.606
- I can't believe we're going
back home without a deal.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.150
- Hey, it was always
a long shot.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.735
Look at it this way.

00:26.776 --> 00:29.362
We got to see a new country
and meet some lifelong friends.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.239
- Randall, you've made
zero friends on this trip.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.159
- But I did get to spend
a solid day in the museum.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.910
Learned a ton
about Cannibal's Peak.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.371
The things those soccer players
did to survive--

00:38.413 --> 00:40.832
they had
these life-sized dioramas...

00:42.250 --> 00:43.668
Hey, listen.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.045
You tried your best.

00:45.086 --> 00:48.089
You have no experience
in international diplomacy.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.966
The president
just threw you in there.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.885
People train for years
to prepare

00:51.926 --> 00:52.886
for a situation like that.

00:52.927 --> 00:54.304
I know.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.056
It's just, getting back
into the political arena

00:56.097 --> 00:57.724
and failing--again.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.684
It's frustrating,
putting in the work

00:59.726 --> 01:01.728
and still feeling completely
out of my element.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.440
And honestly, it reminds me
of when I first started acting.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.401
<i>I was now one of the top</i>
<i>wrestlers in the country,</i>

01:08.443 --> 01:11.071
<i>and with that distinction</i>
<i>came new opportunities.</i>

01:11.112 --> 01:13.114
Bubbles, nice, Vince.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.366
What's the occasion?

01:14.407 --> 01:16.701
- The WWF
has never been bigger.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.828
And so much of our success
is thanks to you

01:18.870 --> 01:20.372
and all you've brought
to the company.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.333
I mean, we literally took one
of your catchphrases

01:23.375 --> 01:25.251
and made a whole new show
called "SmackDown!"

01:25.293 --> 01:27.212
- [chuckles]
Thank you, Vince.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.755
It means a lot
to hear you say that.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.467
Mm, one sec.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.470
I hate sparkling water.
It's unnatural.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.014
[intercom beeps]
Artie, no more bubble water.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.432
I know I requested it.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.892
Maybe we picked
the wrong brand.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.686
Is this the one
with the trees on the label?

01:42.727 --> 01:44.938
- The label says
it's from Poland.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.272
Poland?

01:46.314 --> 01:48.274
Artie, I can't be drinking
war-torn water.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.151
Okay, from now on,
I'd like all my water

01:50.193 --> 01:51.778
to be peaceful and regular.

01:51.820 --> 01:52.654
You got it, Vince.

01:52.696 --> 01:53.697
No problem--
[intercom beeps]

01:53.738 --> 01:55.198
- Our ratings are
through the roof,

01:55.240 --> 01:57.450
and there's a sense we can
attract an even wider audience

01:57.492 --> 01:59.285
by having some
of our superstars cross over

01:59.327 --> 02:00.745
into scripted television.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.622
And given you're one
of our top guys,

02:02.664 --> 02:03.998
I'd like you
to be the tip of the spear.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.959
You mean, like, as an actor?

02:06.001 --> 02:07.293
Are you open to the idea?

02:07.335 --> 02:09.212
- I mean, I've never seriously
thought about it,

02:09.254 --> 02:12.757
but what kid didn't want to be
Schwarzenegger or Stallone?

02:12.799 --> 02:14.968
Action stars, exactly.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.804
And the show we'd like to cast
you in isn't just action.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.098
It's cyber-action.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.725
You ever see the movie
"The Net"?

02:21.766 --> 02:23.476
- No, not yet,
but it's on my list.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.811
Oh, you got to see it.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.604
Sandra Bullock
was always sprinting somewhere

02:26.646 --> 02:28.314
while a computer was loading.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.649
The tension was incredible.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.985
Yeah, I was told
it did for computers

02:32.027 --> 02:33.445
what "Speed 2" did for boats.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.071
- And is Sandra gonna be
in the show?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.490
- They didn't say,
but probably.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.409
- I mean, I don't know
anything about acting.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.618
Oh, don't worry.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.786
You're gonna be playing
a wrestler,

02:41.828 --> 02:43.038
basically a version
of yourself.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.582
- That could be cool.
I know how to do that.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.709
And you're okay with me
missing TV for this?

02:47.751 --> 02:50.170
- That's the best part.
You won't miss any matches.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.297
We'll fly you out for the shoot
and have you back next week

02:52.339 --> 02:53.340
for "Monday Night Raw."

02:53.381 --> 02:55.592
- Sounds like fun.
- Terrific.

02:55.633 --> 02:56.968
[intercom beeps]
Artie!

02:57.010 --> 02:58.511
Set a call with the network.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.305
Dwayne's jumping
into "The Net."

03:00.347 --> 03:01.556
Got it.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.557
Do you want me to do that
before I change

03:02.599 --> 03:03.683
the water order, sir, or--

03:03.725 --> 03:06.519
- Figure it out, Artie!
[intercom beeps]

03:06.561 --> 03:08.521
Sorry about the kid.

03:08.563 --> 03:11.399
- Um, I-I need
to call you back.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.817
- It can be anything
you want it to be.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.277
That's what's
so great about it.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.029
- Sometimes, you want
banana bread and a cheeseburger

03:16.071 --> 03:17.197
at the same time.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.531
- Or smoked salmon
and key lime pie.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.368
- Oh, that is not a meal.
That's chaos.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.870
I'm just saying,
brunch is a ridiculous concept.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.497
[scoffs]

03:25.538 --> 03:27.707
- Hey, babe, how was your day?
- Hey, good.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.626
Funny thing, I met with Vince,

03:29.668 --> 03:31.961
and our network partner
offered me an acting role

03:32.003 --> 03:33.046
on one of their TV shows.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.381
[both gasp]

03:34.422 --> 03:36.299
- Yeah, it's only
for one episode,

03:36.341 --> 03:38.176
but it's for a new show
called "The Net,"

03:38.218 --> 03:39.678
based
on the Sandra Bullock movie.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.597
- What?
Oh, I love her!

03:42.639 --> 03:45.392
Do you know Sandra
is fluent in German?

03:45.433 --> 03:47.811
She's part Samoan, 1/16.

03:47.852 --> 03:49.521
You have to look,
but it's there.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.356
- You know,
I was almost on the big screen.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.524
Yes, we know, Dad.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.192
You've told the story
a hundred times.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.278
- You were almost in a movie?
- Well, thank you, Dany.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.364
I considered being
in the movie "Predator,"

03:59.406 --> 04:00.907
even made an audition tape.

04:07.539 --> 04:11.292
I ain't got time to bleed!

04:12.752 --> 04:15.797
Hi, I'm Rocky Johnson.
I'm 6'2", and I live in Hawaii.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.966
- You almost played
Jesse Ventura's part?

04:18.008 --> 04:20.093
- Yeah, lucky for him,
I never sent the tape in.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.344
Why?

04:21.386 --> 04:22.429
- Role didn't have
enough lines.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.848
No meat on the bones. Pass.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.599
- Oh, this is so exciting,
Dewey.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.767
But I hope this doesn't mean

04:27.809 --> 04:29.436
you're taking a break
from wrestling.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.603
You're finally seeing
the success

04:30.645 --> 04:31.855
you've worked so hard for.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.773
- Don't worry, Mom.
I'm gonna do both.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.109
Vince is fully supportive,
and he thinks

04:36.151 --> 04:38.987
this will help the WWF develop
an even bigger fanbase.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.613
- So what kind
of acting role is it?

04:40.655 --> 04:41.823
- Well, Vince said
I'm playing a wrestler,

04:41.865 --> 04:42.949
but I haven't seen
the script yet.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.701
- Perfect.
I'm sure you'll do great.

04:44.743 --> 04:48.079
- Absolutely.
- Fantastic.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.081
If you see Sandra Bullock,

04:50.123 --> 04:53.543
you ask for her autograph,
and you bring it to me.

04:53.585 --> 04:56.171
- I will.
Okay, let's eat.

04:56.212 --> 04:59.007
You get her autograph first.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.842
Okay.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.472
<i>I was pumped for my first day</i>
<i>of filming "The Net,"</i>

05:05.513 --> 05:08.767
<i>but honestly, I had no idea</i>
<i>what I was doing, since...</i>

05:08.808 --> 05:10.477
I've never been
on a TV set before.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.063
Hell yeah, set's the bomb.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.522
Your trailer okay?

05:14.564 --> 05:16.649
I keep my LaserDisc locked up
in mine with my gun.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.068
No, my trailer's great.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.487
Much more privacy
than a WWF locker room.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.197
- Totally, well,
I once meditated

05:22.238 --> 05:23.323
for three hours in mine.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.824
Lost an entire morning
of shooting.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.160
Production wanted me dead,
but whatever.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.703
I'm a director.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.374
Sometimes with art, you gotta
go deep to find the truth.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.460
Come on.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.754
So uh, how's this gonna work?

05:37.796 --> 05:39.673
This is my first time
doing this.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.008
- So in the previous shot,
you'll exit the car

05:42.050 --> 05:46.012
while Angela, the star/computer
programmer/your combat trainee,

05:46.054 --> 05:48.056
watches you enter the gym
to find the crime boss

05:48.098 --> 05:49.557
doing dumbbell curls
on a bench press.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.601
He'll be the guy wearing
Lee jeans.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.520
Then you'll agree to fight
his champion to the death

05:53.561 --> 05:55.522
in an illegal gambling match

05:55.563 --> 05:58.525
being broadcast worldwide
on the Net.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.568
- So the crime boss
works out in jeans?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.112
- Yeah, he's a total maniac.
- For sure.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.948
So do I know that I'm fighting
to the death ahead of time,

06:04.989 --> 06:06.074
or is this a trap?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.701
I just want to make sure
I understand.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.327
All you need to understand

06:09.369 --> 06:11.705
is that you're gonna kick
that dude's ass--hey, Monty.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.665
- And I'll take care of the rest.
- Okay.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.834
- All right, everyone,
let's make some excellent TV!

06:15.875 --> 06:17.377
Dwayne, go ahead
and stand right there.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.462
Perfect, baby, perfect.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.548
Okay.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.216
[bell rings]
Robes are off.

06:23.258 --> 06:26.052
And...

06:26.094 --> 06:27.971
action!

06:28.013 --> 06:30.974
<i>[tense music]</i>

06:31.016 --> 06:33.435
- [flatly]
Make sure you lock the door.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.438
I don't want him
trying to run away.

06:42.694 --> 06:46.406
<i>* *</i>

06:46.448 --> 06:48.116
<i>[grunts]</i>

06:48.158 --> 06:50.827
<i>[grunting]</i>

06:50.869 --> 06:54.247
<i>[impacts and grunts]</i>

06:54.289 --> 06:56.750
- I really like how clear
you're enunciating your lines.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.335
- Was just thinking
the same thing.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.754
I can understand every word.

07:03.465 --> 07:07.427
- So if those agents
you were talking to earlier

07:07.469 --> 07:09.888
use the Internet,
they can stop the fight?

07:09.929 --> 07:11.306
Well, sort of.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.683
First, they need to track
the video feed's IP address

07:13.725 --> 07:14.976
so they can locate me.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.187
- Locate you?
But they were just with you.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.230
What kind of federal agents
are these?

07:19.272 --> 07:20.690
- Boo, FBI!
Kill yourselves!

07:20.732 --> 07:23.068
- Well, actually,
only the guy is with the FBI.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.653
The female lead
is a computer programmer

07:25.695 --> 07:27.530
whose technology skills
help them solve crimes.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.115
Where's Sandra Bullock?

07:29.157 --> 07:32.327
Why didn't anyone call her
before getting into this mess?

07:32.369 --> 07:34.954
<i>[grunting]</i>

07:34.996 --> 07:36.456
- We not gonna talk
about them punches?

07:36.498 --> 07:37.791
Shh!

07:37.832 --> 07:39.793
<i>- Needless to say,</i>
<i>that wasn't quite</i>

07:45.131 --> 07:45.340
.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.716
<i>- After the way the episode</i>
<i>of "The Net" turned out,</i>

07:47.884 --> 07:48.802
<i>I felt like I had</i>
<i>to address it</i>

07:48.843 --> 07:50.512
<i>with Vince right away.</i>

07:50.553 --> 07:52.222
<i>- Yeah, I did an episode of</i>
<i>"Dr. Judy: Old West Surgeon,"</i>

07:52.263 --> 07:53.390
<i>so I get it.</i>

07:53.431 --> 07:54.766
- Hey, Vince.
You got a sec?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.309
There's my guy.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.645
You ready to go toe-to-toe
with Steve Austin this week?

07:58.687 --> 08:00.271
- Definitely,
it's gonna be a great match.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.731
- All right.
- Listen.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.275
I just wanted to apologize
for last night on "The Net."

08:04.317 --> 08:06.236
I hope I didn't embarrass
the company.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.113
- Are you joking?
- I wish.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.864
When you have a chance
to see the episode--

08:09.906 --> 08:11.908
- Dwayne, I watched the show
last night.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.368
You were sensational!

08:13.410 --> 08:14.577
- Really?
- Stop being modest.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.037
I hate false sincerity.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.415
It's like when people ask,
"How's your family?"

08:18.456 --> 08:19.624
They don't care.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.418
They don't give a fig
about my family.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.461
Watch.
Artie, how's your family?

08:23.503 --> 08:24.754
- Well, my mom just--
- See?

08:24.796 --> 08:26.006
I don't care.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.966
Dwayne,
your episode was so good

08:28.008 --> 08:29.551
that I'm rewatching it
right now.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.885
I don't know.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.721
I thought my acting
was kind of stiff.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.723
- Dwayne,
no one's watching your acting.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.641
They're watching you, the Rock.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.935
This is exactly the type
of entertainment

08:38.977 --> 08:41.730
that will bring more fans
into the WWF.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.566
I also loved that scene
when flirty music played

08:44.607 --> 08:45.734
while you taught
fake Sandra Bullock

08:45.775 --> 08:47.235
how to neutralize a bad guy.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.738
- My director said those kinds
of emotional layers

08:49.779 --> 08:51.197
are his artistic signature.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.324
- Stay close to him.
He's going places.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.410
- Did the network execs
say anything about the show?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.579
- They didn't seem to want
to discuss the episode,

08:57.620 --> 08:58.955
which is crazy to me.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.583
But everyone loves what
this crossover initiative

09:01.624 --> 09:02.917
is doing for our ratings.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.878
In fact, I've already booked
you another role,

09:04.919 --> 09:06.755
this time,
on "Star Trek: Voyager."

09:06.796 --> 09:09.299
- "Star Trek"?
That's a major franchise.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.633
- Nanu nanu.
[laughs]

09:10.675 --> 09:12.260
Exciting stuff, right?

09:12.302 --> 09:14.387
You shoot your episode
next month.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.181
<i>- If Vince was happy</i>
<i>with what I was doing,</i>

09:16.222 --> 09:17.932
<i>then I was happy</i>
<i>to keep doing it</i>

09:17.974 --> 09:19.392
<i>and just trying to get better.</i>

09:19.434 --> 09:22.354
<i>Plus, "Star Trek"</i>
<i>was a big, storied franchise,</i>

09:22.395 --> 09:25.357
<i>and I was excited to get a</i>
<i>chance to enter that universe.</i>

09:25.398 --> 09:28.234
Another packed house for
"Thursday Night SmackDown!"

09:28.276 --> 09:30.278
Des Moines really knows
how to party.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.529
<i>I'm so jealous.</i>

09:31.571 --> 09:32.947
I've been dying to see Iowa

09:32.989 --> 09:34.282
ever since we watched
"Field of Dreams."

09:34.324 --> 09:35.825
"Hey, Dad.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.495
Wanna have a catch?"

09:38.536 --> 09:40.997
- Emotional.
<i>- So emotional.</i>

09:41.039 --> 09:42.749
Hey, your dad's here.
You wanna say hi?

09:42.791 --> 09:44.459
Nah, I'm good.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.835
[knock at door]

09:45.877 --> 09:47.962
Oh, that's my food.
I better go.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.464
I gotta get back
to reading too.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.217
I've barely started
this "Star Trek" book.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.511
- I love how seriously
you're taking this.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.638
- You know I want to be
the best at whatever I do.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.972
- Oh, I know.
Bye, babe.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.349
All right. Bye, babe.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.397
- Hey.
- I have three dinners for--

10:05.438 --> 10:06.940
one guest.

10:06.981 --> 10:10.276
- Yeah, you can bring that in.
- Oh, live long and prosper.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.488
- Oh, what a nice thing to say.
You too.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.823
Cool finger trick, by the way.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.617
Come on in.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.328
<i>[soft music]</i>

10:20.370 --> 10:22.247
Live long and prosper?

10:23.415 --> 10:26.668
Oh.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.795
Please. Don't make me laugh.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.797
Ha, you?

10:30.839 --> 10:34.092
I'm insulted they would even
put you in the pit to fight me.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.720
Oh, wait, it's "against me,"
not "fight me."

10:36.761 --> 10:38.179
- Let me start over.
- Hey, you okay, Dew?

10:38.221 --> 10:39.139
You seem kind of nervous
or something.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.348
I just want to be prepared

10:40.390 --> 10:42.308
so I can nail it
when it's showtime.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.768
- Brother, you performed
at the main event

10:43.810 --> 10:45.562
in front
of 30,000 screaming fans.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.855
I think you can handle this.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.523
This is so different, though.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.693
There's no live audience
to feed off of and respond to.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.403
I know this is just a way
to help Vince

10:53.445 --> 10:54.863
expand the profile
of the company,

10:54.904 --> 10:56.072
but I still want
to do a good job.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.574
- Hey, don't even mention it,
all right?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.325
We'll keep rehearsing them
till you get them lines down.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.036
- You're gonna be the best
damn half-woman, half-cyborg

11:01.077 --> 11:02.328
this show's ever had.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.248
- Bruno, you're
the half-woman, half-cyborg.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.666
Wait, what?

11:06.708 --> 11:08.293
- I'm half-Borg?
- Yeah.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.088
Wow, okay.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.382
This script makes
a lot more sense now.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.884
- It says--
- I didn't even see that.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.677
- It's okay, it's okay.
Okay, ready?

11:17.719 --> 11:19.929
Yep, start it over.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.389
<i>So after a lot of practice,</i>

11:21.431 --> 11:24.684
<i>I was ready to bring the heat</i>
<i>on "Star Trek."</i>

11:24.726 --> 11:27.562
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

11:27.604 --> 11:29.856
Live long and prosper.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.775
- Wrong species.
You're Pendari, not Vulcan.

11:31.816 --> 11:32.942
Hi, I'm Kim, the director.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.779
- I know.
I was just--I'm Dwayne.

11:35.820 --> 11:36.696
- Nice to have you with us,
Dwayne.

11:36.738 --> 11:37.739
Happy to be here.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.074
Great script, by the way.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.950
I really love how quickly
my character

11:40.992 --> 11:42.952
loses his temper,
which I believe

11:42.994 --> 11:45.497
is an established trait
of the Pendari species.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.083
- Uh, yes, the writer
did a fine job.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.043
- Oh, yeah.
I was thinking, though,

11:50.085 --> 11:51.878
you know,
when I enter the battle pit,

11:51.920 --> 11:53.463
maybe I could address
the crowd,

11:53.505 --> 11:55.090
fire 'em up,
kind of like how I do as--

11:55.131 --> 11:57.509
- Love your attitude,
but as our alien of the week,

11:57.550 --> 11:59.552
you know, the role doesn't
allow for improvisation.

11:59.594 --> 12:00.845
- Alien of the--
- Mm-hmm.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.263
Oh.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.224
That's what the letters
on my chair stand for.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.101
- Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't
overthink it, okay?

12:06.142 --> 12:09.104
We have 26 episodes to shoot
this season, so, you know,

12:09.145 --> 12:11.272
got to keep the intergalactic
trains running on time.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.774
- Got it.
- Ooh, no, no, no.

12:12.816 --> 12:13.942
Don't furrow your brow.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.985
It's real bad
for your face bulges.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.245
[muttering] Excuse me.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.789
Excuse me.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.499
Can I get some water?

12:36.089 --> 12:36.256
.

12:36.297 --> 12:36.548
You?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.675
I'm insulted
they would even put you

12:38.717 --> 12:40.218
in the pit against me.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.512
You're no bigger
than an Aldebaran Mud Leech.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.140
- I must caution you against
dismissing me so lightly.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.850
I possess incredible strength.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.643
- [scoffs]
I think not.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.603
Damon, what are you doing?

12:50.645 --> 12:51.896
You don't shoot rehearsal.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.106
Sorry.

12:54.649 --> 12:57.193
- Okay, so this is where
the battle horn will sound

12:57.235 --> 12:58.737
and the fight starts.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.904
Nathan will lead you

12:59.946 --> 13:01.406
through the exact
fight choreography after,

13:01.448 --> 13:05.535
but basically, you exchange
blows, yeah, and...

13:05.577 --> 13:07.370
- I assure you,
this will be a lot easier

13:07.412 --> 13:08.872
if you cease your resistance.

13:08.913 --> 13:12.000
- It would be a lot easier
if you ceased your punches.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.710
Oh, no, wait,
sorry, my line is,

13:13.752 --> 13:15.754
"I assure you,
it would be a lot easier--"

13:15.795 --> 13:17.589
- Let me start again.
- You know what, it's okay.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.049
If you flub a line
while we're rolling,

13:19.090 --> 13:20.508
don't stop, just keep going.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.010
Okay, we can cut
around it in post.

13:24.596 --> 13:25.889
Yeah.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.182
Yeah.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.475
So that's the gist.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.101
If you can just stand
on your first marks,

13:30.143 --> 13:31.728
we're gonna tweak some lighting
and get you both in wardrobe.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.438
- Yeah?
- Thanks.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.856
- I'm sorry about that.
- Mm--

13:34.898 --> 13:36.066
Kim's right.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.400
I shouldn't
have stopped mid-scene.

13:37.442 --> 13:38.902
- Don't apologize.
It's great you care so much.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.279
- Well, I do give
everything 100%.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.906
A lot of guest stars don't.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.033
Andy Dick may as well
have been drunk.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.659
- Andy Dick did
"Star Trek: Voyager"?

13:46.701 --> 13:48.411
- Yep.
- Hey, Jeri.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.581
Your opening line is actually,
"I possess superior strength."

13:51.623 --> 13:52.582
What did I say?

13:52.624 --> 13:54.167
- You said
"incredible strength."

13:54.209 --> 13:55.710
The writer said
your character wouldn't use

13:55.752 --> 13:56.836
the word "incredible."

13:56.878 --> 13:59.881
- Ah, okay.
Thanks, Marisa.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.342
- Well, looks like one of us
has lines that matter.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.260
- Trust me, when you're part
of the main cast,

14:04.302 --> 14:05.970
you can't mess
with the "Star Trek" universe.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.098
- Oh, yeah,
I realized that right away

14:08.139 --> 14:09.933
while I was doing
my research online.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.309
People have opinions.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.186
Oh, you are not kidding.

14:13.228 --> 14:15.563
But seriously,
thanks for being so prepared.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.565
Sometimes, an actor's job
is simply to play the role

14:17.607 --> 14:18.983
you're given on the show
that you're on.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.027
- I got it, know your role--

14:21.069 --> 14:23.780
And shut your mouth!

14:23.822 --> 14:24.989
- Wow.
- I'm a big fan.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.325
- [laughs]
- Thank you.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.703
<i>- You're hit.</i>
<i>You're bleeding, man.</i>

14:29.744 --> 14:31.705
<i>I ain't got time to bleed.</i>

14:31.746 --> 14:33.248
Nothing beats "Predator."

14:33.289 --> 14:35.125
Arnold's line is my favorite.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.335
Get to the choppa!

14:37.377 --> 14:38.712
Perfect.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.338
Ugh, let me guess.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.590
Jesse Ventura's
chewing up the scenery

14:42.632 --> 14:44.050
with his chewing tobacco,

14:44.092 --> 14:48.138
spitting all on his machine gun
like a...

14:48.179 --> 14:50.140
let me know when it's over.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.976
- I'd like a movie snack.
Do you have any popcorn?

14:53.018 --> 14:54.686
Of course.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.396
Oh, but it's stovetop,

14:56.438 --> 14:58.481
and I'm
kind of a microwave girl.

14:58.523 --> 15:01.568
- I can teach you
how to cook popcorn.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.653
- You know,
I've only done two small roles,

15:03.695 --> 15:06.656
and I already have so much more
appreciation for this stuff.

15:06.698 --> 15:09.075
It would be so cool
to play a role like that.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.368
- You could do that
if you wanted to.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.495
Nah, everyone only wants me

15:12.537 --> 15:14.122
to play some version
of a wrestler.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.874
I'm already a wrestler
in real life.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.209
What's the point of being one
in another galaxy,

15:18.251 --> 15:21.046
or New Orleans,
or wherever "The Net" is set?

15:21.087 --> 15:24.799
- Seattle.
"The Net" is set in Seattle.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.468
Listen.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.470
No one is happier
at the success

15:28.511 --> 15:30.555
you've found wrestling than me.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.183
If you're happy,
keep doing what you're doing.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.226
You'll hear no complaints
from us.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.729
But if this new challenge
is interesting to you,

15:37.771 --> 15:39.147
go after it.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.733
You make it look the way
you want it to look.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.610
There are no fences
around you, Dewey.

15:45.195 --> 15:48.156
<i>- Is it over?</i>
both: No!

15:48.198 --> 15:49.574
Jesse Ventura's great.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.242
- Oh, he's good.
He's very good.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.702
Don't let your dad
hear you say that.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.454
- Dad would have been
pretty good in this.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.956
- Mm...
- Okay.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.542
- Great episode of "Star Trek"
last night, Dwayne.

15:59.584 --> 16:02.087
I'm not a Trekkie, but you were
sensational as Blorg.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.254
Thank you, Vince.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.839
- I was thinking,
for your next role,

16:04.881 --> 16:08.134
something completely different,
huh, like a comedy.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.178
- Yeah, I love comedy.
- Me too.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.429
Nothing funnier
in the world than someone

16:11.471 --> 16:13.348
stepping in dog crap.
[both laugh]

16:13.390 --> 16:16.601
If I could make an entire show
of just that, I would.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.187
- I mean, I'd watch that.
- Right?

16:19.229 --> 16:20.522
Ding-dong, who's that?

16:20.563 --> 16:22.982
Oh, no,
there's crap on my shoe.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.485
- If you smell--dog crap.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.570
- Just one after the other,
people stepping in crap.

16:27.612 --> 16:30.323
- [blowing raspberries]
- That's what crap sounds like!

16:30.365 --> 16:32.492
[both laughing]

16:32.534 --> 16:33.993
Anyway, I'm glad you're into it

16:34.035 --> 16:36.705
because I booked you an episode
of "That '70s Show."

16:36.746 --> 16:37.789
Are you serious?

16:37.831 --> 16:39.040
- I don't joke around
when it comes

16:39.082 --> 16:40.709
to the best decade of all time.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.043
- I mean,
that's such a funny show.

16:42.085 --> 16:46.506
- What's my role?
- One that only you could play.

16:46.548 --> 16:49.134
<i>- My primetime comedy debut</i>
<i>was not only playing</i>

16:49.175 --> 16:51.928
<i>the role of another wrestler,</i>
<i>but that wrestler</i>

16:51.970 --> 16:53.096
<i>was my dad.</i>

16:53.138 --> 16:54.806
Looking good, son.

17:00.020 --> 17:00.395
.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.771
<i>- Even though I was playing</i>
<i>yet another wrestler,</i>

17:02.814 --> 17:04.649
<i>I was really proud</i>
<i>to play my dad.</i>

17:04.691 --> 17:08.194
<i>And he was truly excited</i>
<i>about me playing him on TV.</i>

17:08.236 --> 17:11.656
<i>And of course, as always,</i>
<i>the Soul Man had some notes.</i>

17:11.698 --> 17:13.116
- [chuckles]
Now remember,

17:13.158 --> 17:14.826
if you want
to capture my essence,

17:14.868 --> 17:17.412
you need to let your mouth and
your muscles do the talking.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.997
No such thing
as too much talking

17:19.039 --> 17:20.373
when you're playing someone
who is that good at it.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.624
- Well, I'm pretty sure
they're gonna want me

17:21.666 --> 17:23.209
to stick to the script,
but don't worry,

17:23.251 --> 17:24.544
I'll make you proud.

17:24.586 --> 17:25.920
This is so exciting.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.964
I've never been
on a soundstage before.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.175
- And I just told one
of the lead actresses

17:30.216 --> 17:31.801
I hope she breaks her legs.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.887
- She said that to the woman
that plays the mom.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.388
It was amazing.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.723
Should we head to our seats?

17:36.765 --> 17:38.016
I heard they're handing out
tuna fish sandwiches

17:38.058 --> 17:39.309
before the show.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.227
- We'll be cheering for you,
sweetheart.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.854
- Thanks, Mom.
Love you guys.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.022
Love you too.

17:44.064 --> 17:48.026
[breathes deeply]

17:48.068 --> 17:51.571
<i>[funky music]</i>

17:51.613 --> 17:53.073
Hey.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.949
<i>[laughter and applause]</i>

17:54.991 --> 17:56.326
<i>You know what?</i>

17:56.368 --> 17:58.036
<i>When my son grows up,</i>

17:58.078 --> 18:00.330
<i>he's gonna become</i>
<i>the most electrifying man</i>

18:00.372 --> 18:02.707
<i>in sports entertainment.</i>

18:02.749 --> 18:06.044
[laughter]

18:06.086 --> 18:07.545
Bravo, Dewey!

18:07.587 --> 18:09.714
The only person who
could have done a better job

18:09.756 --> 18:12.217
at playing me on screen
than you is me.

18:12.258 --> 18:16.596
- I like Dewey's version of you
better than your version.

18:16.638 --> 18:19.099
Babe, you're really good.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.392
I agree.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.227
Your hard work
is starting to pay off.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.478
Thanks, Mom.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.604
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>I felt like</i>

18:24.646 --> 18:25.897
<i>I could see myself</i>
<i>doing a version</i>

18:25.939 --> 18:28.316
<i>of acting the way that</i>
<i>I wanted to do it.</i>

18:28.358 --> 18:29.734
<i>I was also about to get one</i>

18:29.776 --> 18:31.361
<i>of the most exciting</i>
<i>phone calls of my life.</i>

18:31.403 --> 18:33.446
[phone rings]

18:33.488 --> 18:35.281
- Hello?
- Great show, Bubba!

18:35.323 --> 18:38.159
Now, open your ears!
I write screenplay.

18:38.201 --> 18:40.745
I mail you pages. We win Oscar!

18:40.787 --> 18:42.622
Hollywood champion number one!

18:42.664 --> 18:43.915
<i>That was the call?</i>

18:43.957 --> 18:46.042
<i>- No, that was the call</i>
<i>before the call.</i>

18:46.084 --> 18:47.961
<i>- Oh, it kind of felt</i>
<i>like you were teeing up</i>

18:48.003 --> 18:49.379
<i>the actual call there.</i>

18:49.421 --> 18:51.089
- Well, I can't wait
to read it, Sheiky.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.341
Forrest Gump jabroni actor!

18:53.383 --> 18:54.592
- Tell him
he still owes me money.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.636
- Talk soon.
<i>- Yes, Bubb--</i>

18:56.678 --> 18:58.847
- You didn't tell him.
[phone ringing]

18:58.888 --> 19:00.849
- Wow, the phone's ringing
off the hook.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.226
- Everybody
must have seen the show.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.353
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, is this Dwayne?</i>

19:05.395 --> 19:06.646
Yes, this is Dwayne.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.982
<i>Dwayne, it's Lorne Michaels.</i>

19:09.024 --> 19:12.819
- Hi.
Uh, it's great to talk to you.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.947
[both mouthing]

19:15.989 --> 19:18.783
- I think he said
Bret Michaels from Poison.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.161
<i>- I've been trying</i>
<i>to track you down.</i>

19:21.202 --> 19:23.204
<i>Um, Vince and I were talking,</i>

19:23.246 --> 19:25.457
<i>and he thinks you've got</i>
<i>something special</i>

19:25.498 --> 19:27.417
<i>that would work for us</i>

19:27.459 --> 19:29.961
<i>and that you'd be</i>
<i>a perfect fit.</i>

19:30.003 --> 19:31.087
A fit?

19:31.129 --> 19:32.672
<i>- To host</i>
<i>"Saturday Night Live."</i>

19:32.714 --> 19:34.049
<i>- [laughs]</i>
<i>No way.</i>

19:34.090 --> 19:36.760
So you get the call
that every young comedian

19:36.801 --> 19:38.636
aspires to receive,
but instead,

19:38.678 --> 19:40.638
it goes to a wrestler
who has no aspirations

19:40.680 --> 19:42.098
of hosting the show?

19:42.140 --> 19:44.017
- Let me guess, hosting "SNL"
is one of your dreams.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.435
Hell yeah!

19:45.477 --> 19:46.603
And when that call comes,

19:46.644 --> 19:47.687
I'll be ready
with my pre-written

19:47.729 --> 19:49.230
"Wayne's World" sketch.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.399
I play Wayne's
Korean stepfather

19:51.441 --> 19:54.277
who comes home
from the Gulf War.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.528
Oh.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.698
Sounds like a fresh idea.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.325
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.827
- You want to develop it into,
like, a buddy comedy thing?

20:02.869 --> 20:05.330
- I think it needs a little bit
more to it, but sure.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.664
- Yeah?
- Sure.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.832
- Okay, yeah, me and you.
- Yeah, down the road.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.000
Absolutely.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.293
- Yeah, we'll work on it,
like, tomorrow.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.337
- Down the road.
- Down the road tomorrow, sure.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.797
- [chuckles]
- Okay.

20:13.838 --> 20:17.676
So anyway, you get the call
from Lorne, and then what?

20:17.717 --> 20:20.679
- Mr. Michaels,
I would be truly honored

20:20.720 --> 20:23.181
to host "Saturday Night Live."

20:23.223 --> 20:26.976
<i>Great. Glad to hear it.</i>

20:27.018 --> 20:30.897
- But I would love
to not play a wrestler in it.

20:32.524 --> 20:34.359
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:34.401 --> 20:36.903
<i>I'll give that some thought.</i>

20:36.945 --> 20:38.530
- So they came to you
with an offer to host,

20:38.571 --> 20:40.323
and you came back
to them with terms?

20:40.365 --> 20:41.533
Correct.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.826
If I was gonna walk
into a new arena,

20:42.867 --> 20:44.703
then I wanted to be the best
that I could be,

20:44.744 --> 20:48.289
and for me, that was way
beyond just being a wrestler

20:48.331 --> 20:50.208
playing a wrestler
for the joke.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.502
<i>And luckily, Lorne agreed.</i>

20:53.670 --> 20:55.171
<i>The next thing I knew,</i>

20:55.213 --> 20:58.216
<i>I found myself walking down</i>
<i>a new kind of tunnel.</i>

20:58.258 --> 21:00.677
<i>It reminded me</i>
<i>of just five years earlier,</i>

21:00.719 --> 21:01.803
<i>when I was walking</i>
<i>through the tunnel</i>

21:01.845 --> 21:03.888
<i>to my first arena show.</i>

21:03.930 --> 21:06.016
<i>But this time,</i>
<i>it was the tunnel</i>

21:06.057 --> 21:08.184
<i>to the iconic</i>
<i>"Saturday Night Live" stage.</i>

21:08.226 --> 21:12.689
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the Rock!</i>

21:12.731 --> 21:14.858
- Why'd you stop?
What's wrong?

21:19.404 --> 21:21.031
- Excuse me, Jerry?
- Yes, sir.

21:21.072 --> 21:23.158
- Let's turn around
and head back to the estate.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.576
We're not going home.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.411
Talking about
standing up to power

21:26.453 --> 21:27.912
and asking for what you want,

21:27.954 --> 21:29.748
I'm surprised
I didn't think of it sooner.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.541
I have a plan that can save
this trade deal.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.001
[chuckles]

21:33.043 --> 21:36.463
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
