<i>Air and naval

00:17.362 --> 00:20.031
<i>This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:20.065 --> 00:21.732
<i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:21.767 --> 00:23.468
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:23.502 --> 00:24.869
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:24.903 --> 00:26.104
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:26.138 --> 00:28.072
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.107 --> 00:30.575
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:30.609 --> 00:33.010
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:33.045 --> 00:34.178

favorites.

...until something stops him.

00:36.715 --> 00:39.484
<i>It was right</i>
<i>in front of my eyes,</i>

00:39.518 --> 00:41.119
<i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

00:41.153 --> 00:44.188
<i>A plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:44.223 --> 00:46.691
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:46.725 --> 00:50.628
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:56.535 --> 00:58.669
<i>You're the smartest</i>
<i>and the dumbest fucking person</i>

00:58.704 --> 01:00.838

one who got it wrong.</i>

01:02.574 --> 01:04.608

01:25.297 --> 01:26.931
Saul, I didn't

01:26.965 --> 01:28.232
expect you back tonight.

01:28.267 --> 01:30.935
This is Alain Bernard.

01:30.969 --> 01:32.603
Alain Bernard
admitted to being an asset

01:32.638 --> 01:34.605
of Israeli intelligence.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.208
Put him in a dark fucking hole.

01:37.242 --> 01:39.510
It's time we talk
about Nasser Hejazi,

01:39.545 --> 01:43.314
whose named you used to
embezzle more than $45 million.

01:43.348 --> 01:45.516
You are now an enemy
of your own state.

01:45.551 --> 01:47.018
I got plans for you.

01:47.052 --> 01:48.152
What plans?

01:48.187 --> 01:49.987
I'm gonna play you back
into Iran.

01:50.022 --> 01:52.623
From now on, you work for us.

01:52.658 --> 01:54.358
I have a play.

01:54.393 --> 01:55.693
It involves Brody.

01:55.727 --> 01:56.861
What's your big idea?

01:56.895 --> 01:58.396
Danesh Akbari.

01:58.430 --> 02:00.364
Head of Iran's
Revolutionary Guard.

02:00.399 --> 02:01.732
Right.

02:01.767 --> 02:03.267
Javadi's boss.

02:03.302 --> 02:04.502
Brody can get to him.

02:04.536 --> 02:05.870
<i>The guys get me to the border</i>

02:05.904 --> 02:07.338
<i>where I surrender myself?</i>

02:07.372 --> 02:08.639
<i>Correct.</i>

02:11.008 --> 02:12.677
<i>What just happen?</i>

02:12.711 --> 02:15.313
<i>We are under heavy fire!</i>

02:15.347 --> 02:17.615
Fall back! Fall back!

02:17.649 --> 02:18.683
I'm not going back.

02:18.717 --> 02:21.052
You can't do this by yourself.

02:21.086 --> 02:24.522
I'm 300 yards from the border,
Carrie! I can make it!

02:24.556 --> 02:26.524
You will die over there!

02:26.558 --> 02:28.392
No, you're wrong, Carrie!

02:28.427 --> 02:29.860
'Cause you're gonna get me home!

02:29.895 --> 02:31.062
No, don't say that!

02:31.096 --> 02:33.164
Do not put that on me!
It's a fantasy!

02:33.198 --> 02:35.800
You'll find a way. I have faith.

02:40.672 --> 02:42.139
...Nicholas Brody.

02:43.989 --> 02:47.943
_

02:51.750 --> 02:53.551
Brody made it across.

02:53.585 --> 02:55.052
And you, Saul,

02:55.087 --> 02:57.188
are still in the game.

02:57.222 --> 02:58.923
I'll be damned.

02:58.957 --> 03:01.092
You have an uncle in Tehran.

03:01.126 --> 03:03.060
Carrie, no.

03:03.095 --> 03:05.529
Fara, we have a brother agent
in the field.

03:05.564 --> 03:08.199
Soon to be in mortal danger.

03:08.233 --> 03:11.569
Don't we owe him every chance
to get out alive?

03:18.944 --> 03:21.112
Are you ready?

03:21.146 --> 03:23.047
Ready for what?

03:23.081 --> 03:25.549
To go with me to Tehran.

03:56.381 --> 03:58.115
- Give us a few minutes.
- Yes, sir.

04:04.255 --> 04:06.557
They let me out one hour a day.

04:06.591 --> 04:08.559
To exercise.

04:08.593 --> 04:12.563
In a room that's...
three feet bigger than this.

04:12.597 --> 04:15.432
Well, you spy on us,
that's what you get.

04:15.466 --> 04:17.567
I'm not a spy.

04:17.601 --> 04:19.570
Well, we caught you red-handed.

04:19.603 --> 04:21.738
You caught me with your wife.

04:21.773 --> 04:24.341
You don't want to
be antagonizing me,

04:24.375 --> 04:26.643
not when I'm here
to get you out.

04:26.678 --> 04:28.812
What do you want?

04:28.847 --> 04:31.215
I have an operation
in progress.

04:31.249 --> 04:33.483
In Tehran.

04:33.518 --> 04:37.020
Support team for that operation
was forced to pull out.

04:37.055 --> 04:39.623
Mossad has agents
on the ground there.

04:39.657 --> 04:41.425
I need two of them.

04:41.459 --> 04:44.294
You can ask Tel Aviv yourself.

04:44.329 --> 04:47.130
Well, they'd ask a lot of
questions about the mission,

04:47.165 --> 04:49.433
questions I'm not
prepared to answer.

04:49.467 --> 04:52.336
- But it won't be any different if I ask.
- It better be.

04:52.370 --> 04:54.605
'Cause it's the only reason
I'm standing here talking

04:54.639 --> 04:57.241
to the greaseball
who fucked my wife.

04:57.275 --> 05:00.277
No one wants you here.

05:00.311 --> 05:03.447
Not Mossad, not me.

05:03.481 --> 05:05.916
Do everyone a favor.

05:05.950 --> 05:09.620
Make this happen.

05:09.654 --> 05:13.790
Abu Nazir arranged
my escape route for me.

05:13.825 --> 05:16.526
I left Halifax in a container
on a freighter.

05:16.561 --> 05:18.195
It took me to Colombia.

05:18.229 --> 05:21.064
There I was taken
by Jeep to Venezuela.

05:21.099 --> 05:22.799
There was trouble
at the border.

05:22.834 --> 05:25.802
- That's when I was shot.
- By?

05:25.837 --> 05:28.472
I don't know. Someone trying
to collect the reward.

05:28.506 --> 05:29.806
And then?

05:29.841 --> 05:32.142
I told you.

05:32.176 --> 05:33.944
They...

05:33.978 --> 05:35.946
they took me to Caracas.

05:35.980 --> 05:38.015
To this... slum.

05:38.049 --> 05:39.283
Where you became an addict.

05:39.317 --> 05:41.652
What? Wait.
No. No.

05:41.686 --> 05:43.020
I was shot.

05:43.054 --> 05:44.554
Here and here.

05:44.589 --> 05:48.358
They used heroin on me
for the pain.

05:48.393 --> 05:51.194
It wasn't easy to stop,
but I did.

05:53.798 --> 05:56.266
- How long did that take?
- A while.

05:56.301 --> 05:58.402
- Do you have AIDS?
- No.

05:58.436 --> 05:59.403
Have you been tested?

05:59.437 --> 06:01.204
Why are we even
talking about this?

06:01.239 --> 06:03.040
I don't have AIDS.

06:03.074 --> 06:07.377
I left Caracas
because I was gonna die there.

06:07.412 --> 06:09.980
An Imam helped me get out,

06:10.014 --> 06:13.050
get here to Iran,
and I just want asylum.

06:13.084 --> 06:16.219
I don't understand why you're
giving me such a hard time.

06:16.254 --> 06:18.922
Is that what you think
we're doing?

06:18.957 --> 06:21.491
Giving you a hard time?

06:24.195 --> 06:26.096
I've...

06:26.130 --> 06:29.032
I've traveled so far,

06:29.067 --> 06:32.536
and I almost didn't make it,
and I just thought...

06:34.572 --> 06:38.208
I just thought I'd be safe here.
I just...

06:38.242 --> 06:40.811
I just thought I'd be welcome.

06:40.845 --> 06:42.946
Why?

06:42.981 --> 06:44.781
Because of what I did.

06:44.816 --> 06:47.384
Bombed Langley.

06:47.418 --> 06:49.519
Their heart.

06:49.554 --> 06:51.188
You think what?

06:51.222 --> 06:53.423
We like traitors here?

06:54.792 --> 06:56.760
No.

06:56.794 --> 06:59.763
- Who sent you?
- No one. I told you.

06:59.797 --> 07:02.099
I just want asylum.

07:02.133 --> 07:05.168
I just w... want rest.

07:07.438 --> 07:09.406
Should we take a break?

07:09.440 --> 07:11.708
Yes. Please. Please.

07:11.743 --> 07:14.578
No.

07:14.612 --> 07:16.747

Masud Sherazi?

10:44.021 --> 10:45.455
Yes?

10:45.489 --> 10:47.891
I'm a friend of your niece.

11:15.219 --> 11:17.887
You have something for me.

11:26.697 --> 11:29.132
Where is it?

11:29.166 --> 11:32.335
First you tell me
what's going on.

11:32.370 --> 11:34.671
What did Fara say to you?

11:34.705 --> 11:36.172
That she needed a favor.

11:36.207 --> 11:39.209
For your own protection,
that's all you want to know.

11:39.243 --> 11:41.478
And was this for my protection?

11:41.512 --> 11:44.314
Sending contraband through
customs, here to my house?

11:44.348 --> 11:46.650
- It never went through customs.
- It says!

11:46.684 --> 11:48.785
No, those are our labels.

11:48.819 --> 11:51.288
It came by diplomatic pouch
from Geneva.

11:52.356 --> 11:54.824
You're CIA, aren't you?

11:56.861 --> 11:59.329
I'm a friend of your niece's.

11:59.363 --> 12:01.331
So she's CIA, too.

12:01.365 --> 12:03.133
Working against her own country.

12:03.167 --> 12:05.302
Working for her country.

12:05.336 --> 12:07.904
She trusted you
to understand that.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.777
She asked me to give you this.

12:20.651 --> 12:23.653
She wears the hijab there
in America?

12:24.655 --> 12:27.290
I think her heart is here still,

12:27.325 --> 12:28.625
in Tehran.

12:28.659 --> 12:30.760
And my brother,

12:30.795 --> 12:33.029
does he approve
what she's doing?

12:33.064 --> 12:36.599
My understanding is
he's grown to accept it.

12:48.312 --> 12:50.313
Thank you.

12:53.417 --> 12:55.585
Tell me, is there anything else
you need?

13:19.643 --> 13:21.711
MAN (over computer
You just said where?

13:21.746 --> 13:23.046
I've traveled so far...

13:24.348 --> 13:26.516
And I almost didn't make it,

I just thought I'd be welcome.

13:33.324 --> 13:35.492
Why?

13:35.526 --> 13:38.628

15:52.830 --> 15:54.030
You got the phone?

15:54.064 --> 15:55.231
Yeah.

15:55.266 --> 15:56.533
How was the uncle?

15:56.567 --> 15:58.701
He was dodgy at first,
then okay.

15:58.736 --> 16:00.036
How did you make out?

16:00.070 --> 16:01.704
Alain got Mossad to say yes.

16:01.739 --> 16:03.072
Good.

16:03.107 --> 16:05.942
I have two agents on the ground
there ready to meet you.

16:05.976 --> 16:07.243
Both Iranian nationals.

16:07.278 --> 16:08.678
What do they know?

16:08.712 --> 16:10.446
I told everyone
as little as possible.

16:10.481 --> 16:12.615
You need to decide
how much to let them in.

16:12.650 --> 16:13.983
I did tell them

16:14.018 --> 16:16.419
they'll be supporting
a close-quarters assassination,

16:16.453 --> 16:18.321
and that you'll be needing
a weapon.

16:18.355 --> 16:21.291
Expect them to bring some
options to the first meeting.

16:21.325 --> 16:23.259
I'd like to make it
at the uncle's house.

16:23.294 --> 16:24.594
You sure?

16:24.628 --> 16:25.995
Yeah.

16:26.030 --> 16:27.530
It's safe there. I trust him.

16:27.565 --> 16:31.000
I got a satellite
over your hotel right now.

16:31.035 --> 16:34.003
I'm on the balcony--
seventh floor.

16:34.038 --> 16:35.772
Is that a head scarf
you're wearing?

16:37.174 --> 16:38.675
You're kidding, right?

16:38.709 --> 16:40.109
I can't see crap.

16:40.144 --> 16:41.711
It's too dark.

16:41.745 --> 16:43.513
We haven't heard much
from Javadi,

16:43.547 --> 16:45.548
but we're taking that
as a good thing.

16:45.583 --> 16:48.818
They got Brody stashed
at a compound near Azadi Tower.

16:48.852 --> 16:51.087
Apparently,
he's holding together.

16:51.121 --> 16:52.455
Well enough anyway.

16:52.489 --> 16:55.191
He survived three solid days
of interrogations.

16:59.496 --> 17:00.897
Carrie?

17:00.931 --> 17:02.332
What?

17:02.366 --> 17:03.866
You good?

17:05.069 --> 17:06.736
Uh, I should probably go.

17:06.770 --> 17:09.305
It's a...
it's a big day tomorrow.

17:10.473 --> 17:12.407
Okay.

17:12.443 --> 17:14.310
Good night.

17:30.227 --> 17:32.195
<i>We didn't agree to this.</i>

17:32.229 --> 17:34.664
<i>Yeah, well, I was told
we had two assets ready to go.</i>

17:34.698 --> 17:35.865
<i>No names, no places.</i>

17:35.899 --> 17:37.934
You will learn
when you need to.

17:37.968 --> 17:39.302
I need to know now.

17:39.336 --> 17:41.571
No, I need to know now
that I can trust you.

17:41.605 --> 17:43.172
And so far, nothing you've said

17:43.207 --> 17:45.675
is making me think that.

17:47.411 --> 17:50.680
We asked Mossad
for the two best men in Iran.

17:50.714 --> 17:53.316
They sent you and you.

17:53.350 --> 17:55.385
Were they wrong?

17:58.122 --> 18:00.590
This assassination
you need help-- where?

18:01.992 --> 18:03.192
I don't know yet.

18:03.227 --> 18:04.494
When?

18:04.528 --> 18:06.496
I'm not sure, but soon.

18:06.530 --> 18:09.499
This is not how we work--
everything wait and see.

18:09.533 --> 18:10.867
I will tell you this.

18:13.070 --> 18:16.005
The target is the head
of the IRGC.

18:18.776 --> 18:20.677
Danesh Akbari?

18:21.945 --> 18:23.546
No one can get close to him.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.947
We can.

18:24.982 --> 18:27.617
He'll be taken down
by an American already in place.

18:27.651 --> 18:30.920
Our job is to get that man
to safety afterwards.

18:30.954 --> 18:33.389
Can you do that?

18:41.231 --> 18:42.899
They say no gun.

18:42.933 --> 18:44.233
Is cyanide.

18:46.136 --> 18:49.305
This, uh, American--

18:49.339 --> 18:52.041
he will need to be
right next to Akbari.

18:52.076 --> 18:54.811
I understand that.

18:54.845 --> 18:57.447
And Akbari will be guarded.

18:57.481 --> 18:59.949
Yes. He travels
with a full security detail.

19:05.155 --> 19:07.123
We have C-4.

19:07.157 --> 19:09.258
We can create a diversion.

19:09.293 --> 19:11.761
But what about this?

19:11.795 --> 19:13.930
Who will get this
to the American?

19:13.964 --> 19:15.965
I'll take care of it.

19:28.011 --> 19:29.612
Madame Bezieux?

19:29.613 --> 19:31.637
_

19:32.440 --> 19:34.302
_

19:36.778 --> 19:38.735
_

19:42.495 --> 19:43.705
_

19:44.161 --> 19:45.795
This way, please.

19:56.368 --> 19:57.503
_

19:57.504 --> 19:58.995
_

19:58.996 --> 20:00.773
_

20:00.774 --> 20:04.274
_

20:04.314 --> 20:06.149
Quiet! Quiet!

20:22.966 --> 20:24.934
I liked you better as a blonde.

20:24.968 --> 20:26.302
Was this really necessary?

20:26.336 --> 20:28.037
What do you want,
drinks in the lobby?

20:28.071 --> 20:30.439
You've got the desk clerk
wondering about me now.

20:30.474 --> 20:33.342
Remember, I didn't
want you here at all.

20:33.377 --> 20:35.211
The mission is Akbari.

20:35.245 --> 20:36.813
That's the mission.

20:36.847 --> 20:40.016
What you're here for, getting
Brody out-- strictly optional.

20:40.050 --> 20:42.084
Are we agreed?

20:42.119 --> 20:44.020
The mission is Akbari, yes.

20:44.054 --> 20:45.721
Good.

20:47.090 --> 20:48.891
Good.

20:50.961 --> 20:52.929
Something happened.

20:52.963 --> 20:55.431
What?

20:55.465 --> 20:57.867
Akbari never leaves his office
during the day.

20:57.901 --> 20:59.735
Too risky, he says.

20:59.770 --> 21:02.605
But he's requested
a secure convoy for tomorrow.

21:02.639 --> 21:04.340
- He's heading out.
- Where?

21:04.374 --> 21:06.342
No one's saying.

21:06.376 --> 21:07.977
But I told him yesterday

21:08.011 --> 21:10.613
that he should really talk
to Brody in person.

21:11.648 --> 21:13.382
So, it's on?

21:19.456 --> 21:21.791
Is that it? The device?

21:21.825 --> 21:23.826
Yeah.

21:27.331 --> 21:28.631
Israeli.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.001
Can you get it to Brody?

21:34.972 --> 21:36.939
I'll find a way.

21:39.109 --> 21:41.077
<i>Okay, listen up.</i>

21:41.111 --> 21:43.114
We have movement in Tehran.

21:45.082 --> 21:47.049
We now expect closure
on our operation,

21:47.084 --> 21:49.652
one way or another
at approximately 9:00 AM

21:49.686 --> 21:51.487
tomorrow local time.

21:51.521 --> 21:53.789
Intelligence suggests
this will take place

21:53.824 --> 21:57.493
at a compound near Azadi Tower
where Brody is currently held.

21:57.527 --> 22:01.764
<i>The weapon, a cyanide needle,</i>

22:01.798 --> 22:03.399
<i>is being delivered to him,</i>

22:03.433 --> 22:05.835
<i>along with the plan</i>
<i>for his extraction.</i>

22:05.869 --> 22:08.838
<i>Brody's job is</i>
<i>to position himself</i>

22:08.872 --> 22:12.475
<i>in direct contact</i>
<i>with the target, Danesh Akbari.</i>

22:12.509 --> 22:14.944
- How does he get past the guards?
- He doesn't.

22:14.978 --> 22:16.479
Target comes to him.

22:16.513 --> 22:18.981
We're expecting a
personal encounter,

22:19.016 --> 22:20.449
initiated by Akbari.

22:20.484 --> 22:23.352
We have two Mossad
agents in place,

22:23.387 --> 22:24.720
one with a direct sightline

22:24.755 --> 22:26.355
into the compound
from this building here.

22:26.390 --> 22:28.658
<i>That agent will remotely</i>
<i>detonate a motorcycle bomb</i>

22:28.692 --> 22:30.660
<i>in this alley at a moment</i>

22:30.694 --> 22:32.495
<i>when Brody is proximal</i>
<i>to Akbari,</i>

22:32.529 --> 22:34.263
<i>at the very least</i>
<i>in the same room.</i>

22:34.298 --> 22:38.501
<i>The explosion should generate</i>
<i>sufficient confusion</i>

22:38.535 --> 22:42.271
<i>to allow Brody to take out</i>
<i>the target and escape</i>

22:42.306 --> 22:45.374
<i>through this doorway</i>
<i>at the rear of the compound.</i>

22:45.409 --> 22:47.476
<i>It provides a clear exit</i>
<i>to the street</i>

22:47.511 --> 22:50.179
<i>where our two agents</i>
<i>will be waiting in a vehicle.</i>

22:50.213 --> 22:52.548
<i>If the rest follows plan,</i>
<i>Brody will be delivered</i>

22:52.582 --> 22:56.218
<i>to a safe house outside Tehran</i>
<i>a few hours later.</i>

23:00.190 --> 23:02.558
Comments?

23:04.995 --> 23:07.563
I'm aware-- it's a lot
of moving parts.

23:07.597 --> 23:09.632
Where's Carrie in all this?

23:09.666 --> 23:11.400
She's done her job

23:11.435 --> 23:13.069
putting together
an extraction plan.

23:13.103 --> 23:15.137
Shouldn't she be pulled out
before the event?

23:15.172 --> 23:17.974
She doesn't see it that way.

23:19.009 --> 23:20.710
Okay.

23:20.744 --> 23:22.878
Let's get ready.

23:22.913 --> 23:24.880
We have less than 12 hours.

23:54.644 --> 23:56.946
Get up. Now!

23:56.980 --> 23:58.414
What's going on?

23:58.448 --> 24:00.082
Get up and get
dressed... quickly!

24:00.117 --> 24:01.617
Why? What's happening?

24:01.651 --> 24:03.619
In these. Hurry.

24:19.669 --> 24:21.637
Where are my shoes?

24:21.671 --> 24:23.806
Shoes.

24:30.047 --> 24:32.014
Shoes. Hurry.

25:00.377 --> 25:02.311
I think they're moving.

25:03.380 --> 25:04.613
What do you mean?

25:04.648 --> 25:06.582
They are taking him somewhere.

25:14.724 --> 25:17.293
Shit. Get back here.

25:21.498 --> 25:23.666
Saul, are you seeing this?

25:23.700 --> 25:25.101
Brody's being moved.

25:25.135 --> 25:26.469
We see it.

25:26.503 --> 25:29.138
Are they taking him to Akbari?

25:29.172 --> 25:33.409
No. Akbari's convoy left
the IRGC six minutes ago.

25:33.443 --> 25:35.144
We thought he was coming to you.

25:35.178 --> 25:37.313
So where the
fuck is Brody going?

25:39.316 --> 25:41.283
Hey, we need to follow them.

25:41.318 --> 25:43.085
Your assassin is
Nicholas Brody?

25:43.120 --> 25:44.253
Yes. Can we get moving?

25:44.287 --> 25:45.921
The most wanted
man in the world.

25:45.956 --> 25:47.923
This was not important
for us to know?

25:47.958 --> 25:49.959
Well, now you know.

25:49.993 --> 25:52.027
Let's go.

25:53.363 --> 25:55.431
Let's go.

26:04.808 --> 26:06.375
Look at this.

26:06.409 --> 26:07.943
Akbari. Brody.
The convoys are converging.

26:07.978 --> 26:09.645
Converging where?

26:09.679 --> 26:11.614
An area called Darvazy Gar.

26:28.732 --> 26:30.432
Akbari's stopping.

26:30.467 --> 26:32.268
His men are locking
down the area.

26:32.302 --> 26:35.171
They're on Rostami Street.

26:35.205 --> 26:36.305
Where's Carrie?

26:36.339 --> 26:37.473
Two blocks behind Brody.

26:42.445 --> 26:44.413
What is this place?

26:44.447 --> 26:46.448
Almost there.

26:57.127 --> 26:59.595
Akbari's gone
inside that house.

26:59.629 --> 27:00.829
Find out who lives there.

27:00.864 --> 27:02.064
Yeah. We're looking.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.833
Don't just look.
Ask Javadi.

27:04.868 --> 27:08.837
The address is
421 Rostami Street.

27:11.708 --> 27:13.008
Carrie,

27:13.043 --> 27:15.945
Akbari and Brody
are 100 yards ahead of you.

27:15.979 --> 27:18.280
Meeting is on.

27:35.498 --> 27:37.733
Stop here.

27:37.767 --> 27:38.867
Stop! Stop.

27:51.448 --> 27:53.882
This is not a good idea.
We are not set up.

27:53.917 --> 27:55.217
We are. Brody's meeting Akbari.

27:55.252 --> 27:57.086
The only thing that's changed
is the location.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.721
Does Brody even
know we are here?

27:58.755 --> 28:01.223
As soon as he hears the
explosion, he'll know.

28:01.258 --> 28:03.225
Yousef needs to
find a place now.

28:04.794 --> 28:06.629
The best thing is
for us to back away,

28:06.663 --> 28:07.863
wait for a better chance.

28:07.897 --> 28:10.065
There won't be a better chance,
do you understand?

28:10.100 --> 28:11.734
Just do it.

28:11.768 --> 28:13.535
Yousef...

28:26.549 --> 28:29.051
Diversion is set.

28:29.085 --> 28:31.120
Your call, Carrie.

28:31.154 --> 28:33.255
You're the eyes on the ground.

29:20.970 --> 29:23.605
Yousef...

30:01.111 --> 30:02.478
The fuck is happening?

30:02.512 --> 30:04.113
Akbari's leaving.

30:04.147 --> 30:06.148
They never met. Akbari's gone.

30:22.799 --> 30:25.334
I think he's going
inside the house.

30:30.173 --> 30:31.673
<i>For the last fucking time,</i>

30:31.708 --> 30:33.809
can we find out who lives there?

31:04.507 --> 31:06.508
Nicholas.

31:10.747 --> 31:12.614
Saul, a message from Javadi.

31:12.649 --> 31:15.884
421 Rostami is owned
by the IRGC.

31:15.919 --> 31:18.687
Current resident...
Nassrin Mughrabi.

31:18.721 --> 31:21.223
Carrie, Brody is meeting
with Nassrin Mughrabi.

31:21.257 --> 31:23.225
Nassrin?
Who is that?

31:25.228 --> 31:27.896
Abu Nazir's widow.

31:30.166 --> 31:32.000
Why did Akbari do this?

31:32.035 --> 31:35.170
Brody lived in Nassrin's
house for two years.

31:35.205 --> 31:38.740
Akbari's using her to vet Brody.

31:38.775 --> 31:40.742
When Akbari
told me you were here,

31:40.777 --> 31:42.411
I couldn't believe it.

31:42.445 --> 31:44.046
But here you are.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.380
My Nicholas.

31:45.415 --> 31:48.717
I had no idea you were
living in Tehran.

31:48.751 --> 31:52.754
It's been my home
since Nazir died.

31:52.789 --> 31:55.257
I'm sorry, Nassrin.

31:55.291 --> 31:56.992
There was no one like him.

31:57.026 --> 31:58.994
No one.

32:00.296 --> 32:02.865
But I can see you have
been through a lot.

32:02.899 --> 32:04.533
When I last saw you,

32:04.567 --> 32:07.603
you were like a soldier
going to war.

32:07.637 --> 32:10.405
Now I'm a soldier
back from war.

32:10.440 --> 32:12.441
With a victory.

32:14.010 --> 32:16.445
It's hard to see it like that.

32:16.479 --> 32:18.480
I lost so much.

32:19.482 --> 32:21.183
Your family.

32:21.217 --> 32:23.585
My daughter, especially.

32:23.620 --> 32:25.521
When I, um...

32:25.555 --> 32:28.323
when I completed the...
the plan that, um,

32:28.358 --> 32:33.395
Allah had set out for me...

32:33.429 --> 32:35.731
it destroyed her.

32:38.501 --> 32:40.302
She tried to kill herself.

32:40.336 --> 32:42.070
I'm sorry.

32:42.105 --> 32:44.973
It is hard when
you don't have faith.

32:45.008 --> 32:47.809
She had faith.

32:47.844 --> 32:50.412
She had faith that her own
father wouldn't betray her

32:50.446 --> 32:52.514
and make her life unlivable.

32:52.549 --> 32:54.583
Nazir prepared you for this.

32:54.617 --> 32:56.885
He said that if you
were true to Allah,

32:56.920 --> 32:58.387
you would find peace.

32:58.421 --> 32:59.855
And you <i>were</i> true.

33:00.890 --> 33:03.392
And so were you.

33:04.460 --> 33:06.395
Have you found peace?

33:07.897 --> 33:10.933
Sometimes... yes.

33:11.968 --> 33:13.702
But sometimes I ask

33:13.736 --> 33:16.004
why God had to take my son

33:16.039 --> 33:18.140
and my husband instead of me,

33:18.174 --> 33:21.143
and then I feel like
your daughter did...

33:21.177 --> 33:24.379
life is unlivable.

33:24.414 --> 33:26.415
But I survive.

33:27.817 --> 33:29.251
It's what we do.

33:29.285 --> 33:31.219
Yes.

33:31.254 --> 33:32.988
We crawl out of the rubble

33:33.022 --> 33:34.590
and we gather up the bodies.

33:41.965 --> 33:44.232
Why did you come
to Tehran, Nicholas?

33:44.267 --> 33:46.234
I had nowhere else.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.941
What do you want here?

33:55.511 --> 33:57.679
I want to stop running.

34:27.744 --> 34:28.944
What are you doing here?

34:31.246 --> 34:33.514
Tell us what you are doing here.

34:33.549 --> 34:35.150
What... what are you
doing here?

34:48.063 --> 34:50.065
By the grace of God...

34:52.668 --> 34:54.870
I am here to seek asylum.

34:54.904 --> 34:58.240
This is the only place in
the world that I can find peace.

35:21.898 --> 35:24.199
You're a big man
in Tehran, Brody.

35:24.233 --> 35:25.767
A really big man now.

36:18.748 --> 36:21.688
_

36:21.691 --> 36:23.458
In your famous videotape,
you said,

36:23.493 --> 36:24.826
"I love my country."

36:24.861 --> 36:26.828
Which I meant.

36:26.863 --> 36:29.898
And yet America declares you
an enemy of the state.

36:29.932 --> 36:31.399
There's a wide gulf

36:31.434 --> 36:33.335
between what America says it is

36:33.369 --> 36:34.870
and what it actually is.

36:34.904 --> 36:36.004
What are you looking at?

36:36.038 --> 36:38.573
The most recent insult.

36:38.608 --> 36:41.409
Does this explain
your actions on December 12?

36:41.444 --> 36:42.611
It does.

36:42.645 --> 36:43.979
Yes.

36:47.316 --> 36:49.217
Brody learned enough
Farsi in one week

36:49.252 --> 36:50.952
to denounce us
on state television.

36:50.987 --> 36:53.255
Standard
"Death to America" fare.

36:56.058 --> 36:59.761
But I'm told his delivery
is pitch-perfect.

36:59.796 --> 37:02.264
The President is furious.

37:02.298 --> 37:04.466
Just got off
the phone with him.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.001
He demanded
"action."

37:06.035 --> 37:07.002
Yeah.

37:07.036 --> 37:09.037
I got the same call.

37:11.674 --> 37:13.108
The Brody part of the operation

37:13.142 --> 37:15.177
was always a long shot, Saul.

37:15.211 --> 37:17.445
It was all a long shot.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.047
And it worked,

37:19.081 --> 37:20.415
until now.

37:21.784 --> 37:24.619
Brody's never going to get
anywhere near Akbari.

37:24.654 --> 37:26.855
I know.

37:26.889 --> 37:28.456
That's straight from Javadi.

37:28.491 --> 37:31.326
Brody's been handed off
to their PR department.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.662
Our window is closed.

37:32.695 --> 37:34.496
So we just discard him?

37:34.530 --> 37:35.831
We tried to extract him.

37:35.865 --> 37:37.465
Brody didn't even show up
for the rendezvous.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.601
Now he's spouting off
all over Tehran.

37:39.635 --> 37:41.603
Bottom line,

37:41.637 --> 37:44.306
Brody's gone from asset
to serious liability.

37:44.340 --> 37:46.575
I need to know
what he's thinking.

37:46.609 --> 37:49.744
It's obvious
what he's thinking...

37:49.779 --> 37:52.814
what he's saying on
all those YouTube videos.

37:52.849 --> 37:54.616
Iran saved his life,

37:54.650 --> 37:56.484
he loves them, hates us.

37:56.519 --> 37:57.819
And you know what else?

37:57.854 --> 37:59.254
Whatever he's thinking today,

37:59.288 --> 38:01.289
who's to say what
it will be tomorrow?

38:01.324 --> 38:03.992
He's spending his days
with the same people

38:04.026 --> 38:05.627
who brainwashed him
in the first place,

38:05.661 --> 38:07.395
and one thing
we know about Brody is

38:07.430 --> 38:10.498
this is a guy
who changes his mind.

38:10.533 --> 38:12.934
You placed a major asset

38:12.969 --> 38:14.569
inside the IRGC.

38:14.604 --> 38:15.904
Majid Javadi.

38:15.938 --> 38:19.074
That's a huge victory
worth preserving.

38:19.108 --> 38:21.476
Brody could expose
him at any moment,

38:21.510 --> 38:23.011
and the simple fact is

38:23.045 --> 38:25.013
we can't trust Brody.

38:25.047 --> 38:26.948
We never could.

38:26.983 --> 38:29.784
We need to end it.

38:29.819 --> 38:32.354
You mean end Brody?

38:36.058 --> 38:38.660
The President wants
this resolved.

38:42.231 --> 38:44.699
We know where
Brody prays every day.

38:44.734 --> 38:47.068
Mossad has some men
on the ground there.

38:47.103 --> 38:49.804
It's time.

38:53.542 --> 38:55.076
Of course he's
bad-mouthing us.

38:55.111 --> 38:56.578
What do you expect?

38:56.612 --> 38:58.813
He's doing what he needs to,
to preserve his cover, Saul.

38:58.848 --> 38:59.814
That's all.

38:59.849 --> 39:01.516
Well, calm down.
I'm just asking.

39:01.550 --> 39:02.984
The plan changed,

39:03.019 --> 39:05.654
so we do what we always do,
what he's doing-- we adjust.

39:05.688 --> 39:06.888
We did adjust.

39:06.923 --> 39:08.590
We tried lifting him
out of there.

39:08.624 --> 39:09.758
He blew us off.

39:09.792 --> 39:11.226
Because he still thinks
the plan can work.

39:11.260 --> 39:12.427
Is that what he's saying?

39:12.461 --> 39:13.995
That's what I'm saying.

39:14.030 --> 39:15.597
So he hasn't reached out to you?

39:15.631 --> 39:18.033
No. We said all along
any contact with me

39:18.067 --> 39:20.068
was too risky, right?

39:21.070 --> 39:22.737
What's going on?

39:28.010 --> 39:30.178
It's time you got on a plane
and came back.

39:31.247 --> 39:34.883
We can't just abandon him here.

39:36.686 --> 39:39.254
Saul, I have been right
about him this whole time.

39:40.790 --> 39:42.157
I know.

39:42.191 --> 39:44.426
And we'll talk it through
when you're back.

39:47.263 --> 39:49.197
Carrie?

39:49.231 --> 39:50.498
Carrie, you hear me?

39:52.268 --> 39:53.368
Yeah, sure.

39:53.402 --> 39:54.970
Bye.

39:55.037 --> 39:56.271
Bye.

40:04.714 --> 40:06.648
She's not getting on any plane.

40:06.682 --> 40:08.283
I know.

40:08.317 --> 40:10.051
Let's get it done.

40:10.086 --> 40:12.153
Do it now.

40:36.545 --> 40:38.946
Masud. It's Carrie.

40:40.416 --> 40:43.017
I need one more favor.

40:58.233 --> 40:59.367
Salaam.

41:05.374 --> 41:08.209
A friend will call you now.

41:14.183 --> 41:16.150
Will you wait inside for me

41:16.185 --> 41:18.186
a moment, please?
Thank you.

41:39.475 --> 41:41.442
Yes?

41:41.477 --> 41:44.145
It's me. I'm
across the courtyard.

41:59.395 --> 42:01.362
Brody, I have a car.

42:01.397 --> 42:03.364
I need to get you out of Tehran.

42:03.399 --> 42:05.333
I told them already,
I don't want to leave.

42:05.367 --> 42:07.435
I know,
and it made them nervous.

42:08.470 --> 42:10.171
Nervous? What's that mean?

42:10.205 --> 42:12.073
I'm not sure.

42:13.776 --> 42:16.677
No one would tell me,
but I think they're...

42:16.712 --> 42:19.447
they're cutting their losses
to protect Javadi.

42:19.481 --> 42:20.948
Cutting their losses?

42:20.983 --> 42:22.850
I said I'm not sure.

42:22.885 --> 42:24.552
Meaning me?

42:24.586 --> 42:25.953
That's him.

42:25.988 --> 42:29.724
Looks like he's on the phone.

42:29.758 --> 42:32.226
Where's Mossad?

42:32.261 --> 42:35.029
Please, just come with me,
just get in the car.

42:35.063 --> 42:36.731
And go where?

42:36.765 --> 42:38.733
Anywhere. Please.

42:38.767 --> 42:40.067
Please, just come with me now.

42:40.102 --> 42:42.203
As soon as we're clear
of Tehran, we can regroup.

42:42.237 --> 42:44.238
Regroup for what?

42:44.273 --> 42:47.008
What? To make another
fucked-up plan?

42:47.042 --> 42:49.577
No, we just need to leave.

42:49.611 --> 42:51.112
Will you stop saying that?

42:51.146 --> 42:53.981
Leave, leave. Leave where?

42:54.016 --> 42:55.850
I have nowhere to go, Carrie!

42:55.884 --> 42:58.386
I can't go back to the States.

42:58.420 --> 42:59.921
We'll go somewhere else.

42:59.955 --> 43:01.222
And do what?

43:01.256 --> 43:02.623
Hide out?

43:02.658 --> 43:04.492
So they're hunting us both?

43:05.561 --> 43:07.161
I have contacts.

43:09.031 --> 43:11.599
I've been through that
already, Carrie.

43:12.634 --> 43:15.703
I won't do it again.

43:15.737 --> 43:17.905
And I won't do it to you.

43:21.176 --> 43:24.111
And there's the tag team.

43:24.146 --> 43:26.447
Brody, please.

43:33.622 --> 43:34.589
Shit.

43:34.623 --> 43:35.923
It's happening.

43:35.958 --> 43:37.158
What?

43:37.192 --> 43:39.160
Behind you, from the mosque,
there's two men,

43:39.194 --> 43:40.795
one in a dark shirt
and khaki pants,

43:40.829 --> 43:42.497
the other in leather jacket.

43:42.531 --> 43:45.833
Just stay on the phone
and I will talk you through.

43:45.868 --> 43:47.435
He's moving.

43:51.306 --> 43:52.907
- Brody?
- Just get out of here.

44:21.503 --> 44:22.870
Someone warned him.

44:22.905 --> 44:24.805
Who?

44:26.275 --> 44:28.976
She wouldn't fucking dare.

44:48.030 --> 44:49.330
What?

44:49.364 --> 44:51.699
You really fucked up this time.

44:51.733 --> 44:52.967
He's working for us.

44:53.001 --> 44:54.001
The plan failed.

44:54.036 --> 44:55.469
So you send a hit squad?

44:55.504 --> 44:57.605
We tried to recall him.
He said no.

44:57.639 --> 44:58.873
Now thanks to you, he's loose

44:58.907 --> 45:00.808
on the streets of Tehran
doing God knows what.

45:00.842 --> 45:02.710
We got a major asset
on the line here.

45:04.813 --> 45:06.914
You get yourself
on the next plane out of there.

45:06.982 --> 45:08.549
Tell me you understand.

45:31.807 --> 45:32.773
Salaam.

45:32.808 --> 45:33.808
Salaam, salaam.

45:36.712 --> 45:37.778
Please, tell her.

45:37.813 --> 45:39.547
Tell her right now.
It's very important.

45:39.581 --> 45:40.548
Nicholas?

45:40.582 --> 45:42.850
I wasn't expecting you.

45:42.884 --> 45:44.185
I'm sorry.

45:44.219 --> 45:45.653
Nassrin, I need your help.

45:45.687 --> 45:46.687
What happened?

45:46.722 --> 45:47.688
Are you all right?

45:47.723 --> 45:49.023
Somebody just tried to kill me.

45:49.057 --> 45:50.091
My God.

45:50.125 --> 45:52.293
I need to talk
to Danesh Akbari.

45:52.327 --> 45:53.327
Danesh...

45:53.362 --> 45:54.929
he is a very private man.

45:54.963 --> 45:56.764
I have...

45:56.798 --> 46:00.334
I have information
about Majid Javadi

46:00.369 --> 46:03.371
that he absolutely
needs to know, okay?

46:03.405 --> 46:04.538
It's very important.

46:04.573 --> 46:07.274
Please, Nassrin, please, okay?

46:07.309 --> 46:11.112
All right, all right,
I'll tell him.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.081
We got a message from Javadi.

47:20.115 --> 47:21.716
Brody just showed up

47:21.750 --> 47:23.517
at the Revolutionary Guard
headquarters.

47:23.552 --> 47:25.052
What's he doing?

47:25.087 --> 47:29.423
Javadi said he was escorted
by Akbari's men.

47:29.458 --> 47:32.026
He's going to Akbari.

47:32.060 --> 47:34.361
Brody knows we just
tried to kill him.

47:34.396 --> 47:36.764
He's gonna burn
the whole fucking thing down.

47:57.252 --> 47:59.553
Nassrin told me you were upset.

47:59.588 --> 48:02.022
That you wanted to talk to me.

48:02.057 --> 48:03.124
Yes, sir.

48:20.575 --> 48:23.544
You know, it was here
in this office

48:23.578 --> 48:25.780
that I first heard your name.

48:32.854 --> 48:34.789
Abu Nazir told me about you...

48:34.823 --> 48:38.159
what a jewel he had found...

48:38.193 --> 48:40.261
what a sword for Allah.

48:46.768 --> 48:49.403
Why would anyone...

48:49.437 --> 48:52.006
want to kill such a treasure?

48:52.040 --> 48:54.542
To stop me telling you
about Javadi.

48:56.411 --> 48:58.612
What about Javadi?

48:58.647 --> 49:00.414
He wants your job.

49:00.448 --> 49:01.949
You think I don't know that?

49:03.151 --> 49:05.653
The CIA has planned it for him.

49:05.687 --> 49:09.323
The CIA?

49:09.357 --> 49:11.358
Even Javadi wouldn't work
with the CIA.

49:11.393 --> 49:13.794
Well, he is.

49:13.829 --> 49:17.164
They found out he embezzled
millions from the IRGC.

49:17.199 --> 49:18.966
They own him.

49:21.002 --> 49:23.070
You were on the run.

49:23.104 --> 49:26.073
How could you know what
the Americans are doing?

49:26.107 --> 49:28.709
Because I was part of it.

49:30.245 --> 49:34.849
I was to come here to Tehran
to get close to you.

49:34.883 --> 49:37.685
And when you got close?

49:37.719 --> 49:39.820
They wanted me
to take you out...

49:42.224 --> 49:44.658
so they could replace you
with Javadi.

49:44.693 --> 49:47.328
Those were my orders.

49:47.362 --> 49:50.164
But you don't want
to obey those orders.

49:50.198 --> 49:52.366
That's why you came to me.

49:52.400 --> 49:55.870
I came here to redeem myself.

49:55.904 --> 49:57.571
And you have.

49:57.606 --> 50:00.407
You have.

50:00.442 --> 50:02.443
Thank you, Nicholas.

50:06.047 --> 50:08.549
I will deal with Javadi.

50:14.022 --> 50:16.824
You spoke with Abu Nazir
about me?

50:18.526 --> 50:20.427
In this room?

50:20.462 --> 50:23.063
Yes.

50:23.098 --> 50:26.000
