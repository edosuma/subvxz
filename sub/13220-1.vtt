00:25.425 --> 00:27.717
<i>It's been a long night.</i>

00:28.467 --> 00:31.133
<i>Had a few difficult clients.</i>

00:33.133 --> 00:35.592
<i>Worked a lot of hours.</i>

03:14.966 --> 03:18.241
- Don't open the bag, all right?
- Why? What's in it?

03:18.341 --> 03:21.091
It's none of your business what's in it.

03:21.758 --> 03:23.425
All right.

03:24.216 --> 03:26.341
Fucking hell.

03:29.841 --> 03:33.425
- It's shiny.
- It is fuckin' shiny.

03:33.633 --> 03:36.258
Congratulations. Well done.

03:39.091 --> 03:43.408
- You got off light. Not a mark on ya.
- Yeah, I'm stayin' out of it. I got hungry.

03:43.508 --> 03:46.675
Oh, well, thanks
for the backup there, John.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.007
Fuckin' shit.

04:27.716 --> 04:29.950
- No one home.
- Yeah.

04:30.050 --> 04:33.216
Costliest one-night stand I ever had.
You know that?

04:33.341 --> 04:36.866
I'd have been better off havin'
a wank into me hand in the toilet.

04:36.966 --> 04:39.783
- Sure that'd been a lot of fun.
- Go on. Take me home.

04:39.883 --> 04:43.283
Fuckin' depressed, man.
Have to finish me packin'.

04:43.383 --> 04:46.425
All right, smart arse.
You're on the clock now.

04:47.383 --> 04:51.450
You're a prick. You know that?
Well and truly here, you're a prick.

04:51.550 --> 04:54.383
Some prick. Go on.

04:58.341 --> 05:01.033
What do you think?
Are you gonna tell your ma or what?

05:01.133 --> 05:05.758
Tell Ma? She'd fuckin' flip.
I know that much.

05:42.466 --> 05:44.466
Hi. How are ya?

05:44.591 --> 05:48.091
- Fine.
- And where can I take ya?

08:04.258 --> 08:05.824
Fuck.

08:05.924 --> 08:07.883
Mum?

08:10.883 --> 08:12.799
Mum?

08:16.174 --> 08:19.591
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

08:46.299 --> 08:48.216
Mum.

08:49.757 --> 08:51.882
All right. Okay.

08:52.007 --> 08:53.882
Okay.

09:00.341 --> 09:02.091
Fuck.

09:31.882 --> 09:33.757
Okay.

10:12.466 --> 10:14.966
Mum, can you hear me?

10:23.632 --> 10:27.091
I'll do blood pressure.
Open your eyes for me.

10:31.841 --> 10:35.341
Okay, Jean, we're gonna
put you on your side.

10:37.716 --> 10:40.882
- Do you know how long she's been out?
- I have no idea. She was in the house.

10:41.007 --> 10:44.174
I don't know how long she was out.
I found her in her bed.

10:46.299 --> 10:48.491
Jean, I need you to wake up for me.

10:48.591 --> 10:51.657
- I need you to respond.
- Mum? Mum?

10:51.757 --> 10:53.716
Come on, Mum.

10:53.841 --> 10:58.007
Jean, it's okay. You're in the hospital.
Wake up for me, Jean.

11:00.924 --> 11:03.257
Jean, look at me.

11:04.424 --> 11:06.757
That's okay. Keep her on her side.

11:06.882 --> 11:09.049
Keep her on her side.

11:10.091 --> 11:14.282
- It's just a bit of oxygen.
- Just try and relax for me! Okay? Please?

11:14.382 --> 11:16.549
It's okay.

11:18.424 --> 11:20.757
Please let go of her arm.

11:33.591 --> 11:36.466
Is she done?
Can you get her back on her back?

11:36.716 --> 11:40.216
- Come on, Ma. You're all right.
- Jean, we need to put a needle in your arm.

11:40.341 --> 11:44.174
- Does she have any allergies you're aware of?
- I don't know.

12:06.382 --> 12:10.157
From the tests we've run today,
and these are just preliminary calculations,

12:10.257 --> 12:13.757
but one of them in particular is fairly
accurate. It's a liver function test.

12:13.882 --> 12:17.324
Now I guarantee in the very near future
she's going to need a liver transplant.

12:17.424 --> 12:20.407
That's for sure. It's happening, John.
It's coming, okay?

12:20.507 --> 12:24.007
But I have to be very honest with you...
the way she is right now,

12:24.132 --> 12:27.324
I would have very little confidence
she would even get that far.

12:27.424 --> 12:31.007
She's systematically
killing herself slowly every day.

12:31.382 --> 12:34.132
Okay? Concentrate on getting
your mother back on her feet.

12:34.257 --> 12:37.299
We can talk about treatment again,
all right?

12:44.090 --> 12:46.007
Hiya.

13:08.049 --> 13:10.840
Here. Sit up. There you go.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.632
There now, Mum. It's okay.

13:51.174 --> 13:53.090
It's okay.

15:45.340 --> 15:47.798
Where are they?

15:48.007 --> 15:49.173
Where are they?

15:49.382 --> 15:52.115
What the fuck was that?
I'm gonna fucking come!

15:52.215 --> 15:54.490
Oh, fuck off!

15:54.590 --> 15:58.882
I don't have to fuckin' bear this!
I'll break your fuckin' neck for ya!

16:13.757 --> 16:15.840
What are you doing?

16:17.798 --> 16:19.923
What are you doing?

16:20.048 --> 16:22.465
What are you doing, John?

16:24.423 --> 16:28.240
Where are they?
I know you fuckin' took 'em.

16:28.340 --> 16:30.448
Give them to me.

16:30.548 --> 16:33.048
Give them to me!

16:33.757 --> 16:37.532
Why can't you just leave me alone
and mind your own fucking business?

16:37.632 --> 16:43.090
Why can't everyone just leave me alone
and mind your own fucking business?

17:46.382 --> 17:49.048
So, how we gonna get new plates?

17:56.423 --> 17:58.298
I don't know.

17:59.007 --> 18:01.507
I'm gonna buy the new plates, Ma.

18:01.840 --> 18:06.965
I'm gonna go out and work my arse off
for the rest of the week, driving a taxi.

18:07.090 --> 18:09.282
And what are you gonna do?

18:09.382 --> 18:12.948
You're gonna drink and drink and drink,

18:13.048 --> 18:15.632
and you're gonna pass out on that bed.

18:19.923 --> 18:22.532
But I'm gonna go out and work
to buy those new plates,

18:22.632 --> 18:25.465
so we can have something to eat off.

18:26.298 --> 18:29.173
So we're not eating off the table.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.590
You're a good boy, John.

19:24.215 --> 19:26.090
Ma?

19:28.006 --> 19:30.756
- Ma?
- Yeah?

19:32.423 --> 19:35.881
Uh, I'm just gonna go and see Kit today.

19:36.673 --> 19:38.923
You up for it?

19:39.048 --> 19:41.506
Not today, John.

19:45.923 --> 19:49.756
- You know what today is though, yeah?
- I know what today is.

19:51.173 --> 19:55.090
- I just thought we could, you know...
- I said not today, John.

19:56.381 --> 19:59.506
Well, he'd really like to see you.

20:11.590 --> 20:13.548
Okay.

20:33.881 --> 20:36.656
Hip, hip! Hooray!

20:36.756 --> 20:40.965
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

20:41.090 --> 20:44.131
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

20:44.256 --> 20:46.548
<i>And so say all of us</i>

20:46.673 --> 20:50.781
<i>And so say all of us, and so say all of us</i>

20:50.881 --> 20:54.865
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

20:54.965 --> 20:58.615
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

20:58.715 --> 21:01.298
<i>And so say all of us</i>

21:01.423 --> 21:06.006
- Hip, hip! Hooray!
- All right, blow it away. Blow it away.

21:07.298 --> 21:09.823
Last one, last one.

21:09.923 --> 21:12.090
Yeah!

21:19.340 --> 21:22.840
All right. Now, give me back
my baseball cap.

21:23.590 --> 21:26.215
Okay, boys, who's having cake?

21:36.340 --> 21:38.756
It's a card from Mum.

21:54.256 --> 21:56.465
Thanks, John.

21:58.215 --> 22:00.298
Thank Mum.

22:14.423 --> 22:18.215
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm okay, John.

22:24.215 --> 22:26.656
Do you wanna go out for a walk?

22:26.756 --> 22:29.156
- Drive.
- A drive?

22:29.256 --> 22:32.490
- Yeah, a drive, man.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:32.590 --> 22:35.698
- Oh, you flippin' bastard.
- No, no, no.

22:35.798 --> 22:38.506
Can't do that, man. No way.

22:39.215 --> 22:41.715
You son of a bitch.

22:51.464 --> 22:54.964
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
Keep goin', keep goin', keep goin'...

23:30.798 --> 23:33.964
Tell Mum I'm sorry. Okay?

23:36.089 --> 23:38.006
Okay.

23:41.506 --> 23:44.048
Tell her I said hi.

23:46.506 --> 23:47.839
Yeah.

23:52.173 --> 23:54.339
Can I come home?

23:56.298 --> 23:58.464
Not yet.

24:01.423 --> 24:04.006
I don't like it there.

24:07.214 --> 24:10.256
We don't like it at home without you.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.256
Drive?

24:42.881 --> 24:45.464
All right, now you're game.
Now, you're game.

24:45.589 --> 24:49.173
Yeah! I love it when a man
shoots himself in the foot.

24:49.298 --> 24:51.214
Careful.

24:52.339 --> 24:56.131
- You're getting good at this, yo.
- You're gettin' all right yourself.

24:58.589 --> 25:00.881
Get the fuck off!

25:01.589 --> 25:04.573
- Would you fuckin' let go of me?
- That's a new paint job there.

25:04.673 --> 25:06.048
I'm on automatic.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.381
- Prick.
- Fuck off.

25:34.048 --> 25:37.048
Sorry. It's actually saying here
that you're 10 days late.

25:38.923 --> 25:43.339
- All right. What's it come to?
- It's a 40-cent fine a day.

25:45.714 --> 25:47.881
What's that?

25:48.673 --> 25:50.656
Ten days, man.

25:50.756 --> 25:54.673
Forty cent a day.
That's four Euro, man. Come on.

25:54.798 --> 25:58.589
- Why you gettin' smart for?
- No, no, I'm not. I'm just, uh...

25:58.714 --> 26:00.739
I'm just trying to do my job, man.

26:00.839 --> 26:03.631
- We just came in here to rent a fuckin' DVD.
- Shane, come on.

26:03.839 --> 26:06.656
- Everything okay here, lads?
- No, everything's not okay, mini.

26:06.756 --> 26:08.864
- He won't pay his fine.
- How much?

26:08.964 --> 26:11.239
- 40 cents.
- Yeah, per day.

26:11.339 --> 26:13.673
It said four Euro.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.839
- Just pay the fuckin' fine.
- It's the principle, man.

26:16.964 --> 26:20.172
If you're not gonna pay the four Euro,
you can go take a hike, fuckhead.

26:26.381 --> 26:29.964
So, um, are you gonna pay the fine?

26:32.006 --> 26:33.947
Stupid fuckin' question.

26:34.047 --> 26:37.506
I'm just gonna download
something illegally, fuckheads.

26:37.631 --> 26:41.006
I'm taking these. Mighty Munch!

26:42.297 --> 26:44.072
John, come on.

26:44.172 --> 26:46.547
Say hello to your ma for me.

26:59.714 --> 27:02.131
Free shit tastes better.

27:03.714 --> 27:07.089
"Take a hike, fuckhead."

27:08.256 --> 27:10.714
Thanks, Ma. Just leave it down
here on the table. That'd be grand.

27:10.839 --> 27:14.047
Ma, you're in the way. Ma!
Move, move, move.

27:16.922 --> 27:19.881
- What are you doing?
- Gaming. Killing this fuck.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.839
- Shane, language.
- Sorry.

27:25.422 --> 27:28.422
Tackle from the side,
will ya, not the back.

27:29.131 --> 27:31.756
Not the... John, not the back.
I was on a fucking break.

27:31.881 --> 27:33.422
- Shane.
- All right, all right.

27:33.547 --> 27:36.256
Go away, will ya, woman. Go on.

27:39.714 --> 27:42.047
How's your mum, John?

27:42.172 --> 27:44.839
She's good. Thanks, Bridie.

27:45.131 --> 27:48.281
Haven't seen her in the center for a few
days now. I miss her in the kitchen.

27:48.381 --> 27:51.506
Mmm. She has a cold or a flu or something.

27:51.631 --> 27:53.964
She just wanna stay in bed.

27:54.464 --> 27:57.839
- It's going around, all right.
- Yeah.

28:01.672 --> 28:05.422
- Okay, I'll leave you to it, lads.
- Move over!

28:08.756 --> 28:12.047
Thought things would have been
a bit different, you know.

28:14.547 --> 28:17.672
Just felt a bit trapped is all,
the last few months.

28:20.006 --> 28:22.464
Feels like I'm rotten.

28:23.047 --> 28:25.839
All this shit with the kid and all.

28:26.589 --> 28:29.089
Which is fucked up, 'cause I pay,
like, half my labor to her

28:29.214 --> 28:31.881
and I don't even get to see the kid.

28:33.797 --> 28:37.547
I'd be better off sponsoring
a television child in Ethiopia.

28:38.506 --> 28:42.256
Least I'd see him every day.
I'd see him more than I do now.

28:50.089 --> 28:53.047
I just need to get away
for a while is all.

28:56.339 --> 28:59.047
Clear the head. Reassess.

29:05.172 --> 29:08.172
I'm sure I'll see some part
of the world anyway.

29:08.714 --> 29:11.589
Sample me a bit of foreign pussy.

29:12.881 --> 29:17.172
- Probably get full-blown AIDS.
- I could get the AIDS, yeah.

29:19.172 --> 29:21.839
Could get fucking anything.

29:24.381 --> 29:26.839
You shoulda came, man.

29:28.839 --> 29:33.006
You still can. Internet's all loaded up
there on the laptop. All it is, is a click.

29:33.131 --> 29:35.047
- New start.
- Can't.

29:36.297 --> 29:38.756
Just too much going on.

29:51.755 --> 29:54.172
Want a cup of tea?

29:57.089 --> 29:58.255
Ma!

31:43.339 --> 31:46.130
Thanks, man. See you later.

33:29.505 --> 33:32.672
Hey, John. Everything okay?

33:33.255 --> 33:36.713
- Did my ma come in here this morning?
- No. She hasn't been in for a week or so.

33:36.838 --> 33:40.713
- Fuck! Fuck!
- J... John.

33:45.172 --> 33:49.047
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's all fine. It's all fine.

33:49.463 --> 33:52.213
- I'll see you.
- John.

33:55.463 --> 33:58.630
J... Come here. Just sit down, okay?

33:59.047 --> 34:01.255
Are you hungry?

34:01.797 --> 34:05.463
Come on.
There's some stuff left over from lunch.

34:06.505 --> 34:10.297
Just sit down for a minute.

34:33.630 --> 34:36.005
<i>It's been a long night.</i>

34:36.672 --> 34:39.297
<i>Had a few difficult clients.</i>

34:41.380 --> 34:43.838
<i>Worked a lot of hours.</i>

34:47.547 --> 34:50.213
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

35:44.797 --> 35:48.380
What's this? A party?

35:53.213 --> 35:57.463
- You making fun of me, John?
- No, I'm not making fun of you.

35:58.422 --> 36:00.947
I was just thinking the other day,
why is it that Mum has all the fun

36:01.047 --> 36:04.713
and I can't have any?
Thought I'd join you.

36:05.005 --> 36:08.297
Okay. I'm open to share the fun.

36:09.463 --> 36:11.155
Okay.

36:11.255 --> 36:13.672
Anything in particular?

36:18.630 --> 36:21.780
I'll, uh... I'll start
with some wine, please.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.505
Okay. Wine it is.

36:46.296 --> 36:49.421
You know, I don't even like
the way a drink tastes, John.

36:50.838 --> 36:52.838
I only like how it makes me feel.

36:52.963 --> 36:54.880
Huh.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.338
I love the way it tastes.

36:58.796 --> 37:01.338
But I hate the way it makes me feel.

37:08.546 --> 37:11.713
Well, we can't have a party
and not have music.

37:11.838 --> 37:15.588
Okay. We'll have music, so...

37:57.630 --> 38:02.196
<i>Sometimes I feel I've got to</i>

38:02.296 --> 38:05.613
<i>Run away, I've got to</i>

38:05.713 --> 38:11.071
<i>Get away from the pain
you drive into the heart of me</i>

38:11.171 --> 38:13.988
<i>The love we share</i>

38:14.088 --> 38:17.155
<i>Seems to go nowhere</i>

38:17.255 --> 38:20.488
<i>And I've lost my light</i>

38:20.588 --> 38:25.296
<i>For I toss and turn
I can't sleep at night</i>

38:25.421 --> 38:28.696
- <i>Once I ran to you</i>
- <i>I ran</i>

38:28.796 --> 38:31.655
<i>Now I'll run from you</i>

38:31.755 --> 38:34.546
<i>This tainted love you've given</i>

38:34.671 --> 38:37.880
<i>I give you all a boy could give you</i>

38:38.005 --> 38:42.405
<i>Take my tears and that's not nearly all</i>

38:42.505 --> 38:45.196
- <i>Tainted love</i>
- <i>Whoa</i>

38:45.296 --> 38:47.821
<i>Tainted love</i>

38:47.921 --> 38:52.113
<i>Now I know I've got to</i>

38:52.213 --> 38:55.296
<i>Run away, I've got to</i>

38:55.421 --> 38:57.030
<i>Get away</i>

38:57.130 --> 39:00.838
<i>You don't really want anymore from me</i>

39:00.963 --> 39:03.296
<i>To make things right</i>

39:03.421 --> 39:07.030
<i>You need someone to hold you tight</i>

39:07.130 --> 39:10.321
<i>And you think love is to pray</i>

39:10.421 --> 39:15.155
<i>But I'm sorry I don't pray that way</i>

39:15.255 --> 39:18.446
- <i>Once I ran to you</i>
- <i>I ran</i>

39:18.546 --> 39:21.405
<i>Now I'll run from you</i>

39:21.505 --> 39:24.280
<i>This tainted love you've given</i>

39:24.380 --> 39:27.696
<i>I give you all a boy could give you</i>

39:27.796 --> 39:32.296
<i>Take my tears and that's not nearly all</i>

39:32.421 --> 39:35.030
- <i>Tainted love</i>
- <i>Whoa</i>

39:35.130 --> 39:37.088
<i>Tainted love</i>

39:37.213 --> 39:39.838
<i>Don't touch me please</i>

39:39.963 --> 39:43.780
<i>I cannot stand the way you tease</i>

39:43.880 --> 39:46.880
<i>I love you though you hurt me so</i>

39:47.005 --> 39:51.588
<i>Now I'm gonna pack my things and go</i>

39:51.713 --> 39:54.921
- <i>Tainted love</i>
- <i>Whoa</i>

39:55.046 --> 39:58.196
- <i>Tainted love</i>
- <i>Whoa</i>

39:58.296 --> 40:01.488
- <i>Tainted love</i>
- <i>Whoa</i>

40:01.588 --> 40:04.821
- <i>Tainted love</i>
- <i>Whoa</i>

40:04.921 --> 40:08.196
<i>Touch me, baby, tainted love</i>

40:08.296 --> 40:11.446
<i>Touch me, baby, tainted love</i>

40:11.546 --> 40:14.713
- <i>Tainted love</i>
- <i>Whoa</i>

40:14.838 --> 40:18.071
- <i>Tainted love</i>
- <i>Whoa</i>

40:18.171 --> 40:21.088
<i>Tainted love</i>

40:40.879 --> 40:44.129
You think I'm a fuckup, don't you?

40:47.671 --> 40:49.546
No.

40:51.963 --> 40:55.713
- I think you're sick.
- You think I'm what?

40:57.379 --> 40:59.629
You're sick, Ma.

41:00.088 --> 41:02.671
You don't know anything about me, John.

41:06.129 --> 41:09.046
Well, I'd like to know more about you.

41:10.088 --> 41:12.796
Nothin' good to know about me, John.

41:29.421 --> 41:32.338
Okay, then, what do you want to know?

41:39.879 --> 41:44.504
- Why do you hate Kit so much?
- I don't hate Kit.

41:45.588 --> 41:47.671
I just...

41:48.921 --> 41:51.463
find it hard to love him.

41:52.254 --> 41:55.713
Sometimes a mother
just doesn't bond with her child.

41:56.629 --> 41:58.754
It's unexplainable.

41:58.879 --> 42:01.963
Happens more than you'd like
to think, John. It's life.

42:07.754 --> 42:11.046
When I met your da, it all changed.

42:11.504 --> 42:13.338
I got pregnant with Mark.

42:13.463 --> 42:18.004
Another... great achievement of a son.

42:21.338 --> 42:26.171
You have no idea how much your life changes
when you bring another life into the world.

42:28.129 --> 42:32.338
The responsibility. The joy, the pain.

42:32.463 --> 42:35.046
And life is never the same.

42:36.879 --> 42:40.504
And when you have a partner
who's never around...

42:41.338 --> 42:43.838
it slowly gets to you.

42:47.713 --> 42:50.254
Your dad was never here.

42:51.046 --> 42:53.504
Only when it suited him.

42:53.838 --> 42:59.088
I mean, he spent every night in that taxi,
doing God knows what, instead of my bed.

43:16.546 --> 43:19.296
Then I had me second child.

43:22.254 --> 43:24.213
You.

43:24.963 --> 43:27.088
Pretty boy.

43:28.588 --> 43:31.254
At least you can thank
your dad for that one.

43:31.379 --> 43:33.754
Strong jaw.

43:38.171 --> 43:40.879
Mmm. Things changed.

43:42.338 --> 43:46.046
You brought light
into my life for the first time.

43:47.296 --> 43:51.879
You gave me a purpose...
something to live for, something to die for.

43:52.921 --> 43:56.212
And for some reason, John, when you came
along, everything was good for a while.

43:56.337 --> 43:58.671
Everything was...

44:01.087 --> 44:03.337
everything I hoped it would be.

44:03.462 --> 44:05.504
We had a happy family.

44:05.629 --> 44:09.296
Just... good.

44:10.046 --> 44:12.212
Your da was here...

44:12.337 --> 44:16.754
for once, less in the taxi
and more at home with us.

44:20.629 --> 44:22.546
Dancing.

44:23.046 --> 44:25.212
Oh, we danced.

44:25.337 --> 44:28.879
We loved to go dancing, me and your da.

44:29.254 --> 44:33.754
We'd dance all night long,
just the two of us together.

44:33.879 --> 44:39.004
No one else would matter.
It was just us. Us against the world.

44:39.129 --> 44:42.296
We thought, "This was it."

44:44.629 --> 44:47.212
We didn't think it would become...

44:49.087 --> 44:51.587
us against us.

44:56.004 --> 44:58.946
Then I had me third child, Kit.

44:59.046 --> 45:02.629
Well, I call it a child,
but it wasn't really.

45:06.087 --> 45:08.712
I remember when he came out.

45:11.504 --> 45:13.712
When he came out, I remember...

45:13.837 --> 45:17.212
I could see the look
on your da's face, John.

45:18.462 --> 45:22.962
I remember the doctor looking over at the
nurse, shaking his head, and I knew it.

45:24.212 --> 45:27.046
I knew it. He was gone.

45:28.421 --> 45:31.087
Your da left the hospital that day
and he never came back.

45:31.212 --> 45:34.921
Never saw him again. Never.

45:38.296 --> 45:43.004
I waited long enough that people
began to feel sorry for me...

45:44.087 --> 45:46.962
till I felt sorry for meself.

45:49.879 --> 45:53.946
I could not look that child
in the eye from then on, ever.

45:54.046 --> 45:56.337
When they brought him off to me,
I refused to hold him.

45:56.462 --> 45:58.837
No, I didn't want him.

45:58.962 --> 46:00.712
He was nothin' to me.

46:00.837 --> 46:05.171
Only somethin' that came out of me
and ripped my life apart.

46:05.296 --> 46:08.696
I felt sick that he lived
off me for nine months.

46:08.796 --> 46:12.629
The thought of it still makes me
shiver to this very day.

46:13.171 --> 46:15.587
I didn't want him.

46:21.337 --> 46:25.504
And there I was, John... 27, alone...

46:26.004 --> 46:28.379
with two children...

46:29.421 --> 46:31.546
and a thing.

46:34.087 --> 46:37.879
The weird part is, you know,
now people began to pity me.

46:38.004 --> 46:41.921
Me ma and da, friends, my sister.

46:42.462 --> 46:45.921
No one would return my calls.
No one wanted to help.

46:48.962 --> 46:51.462
And I got a new friend.

46:52.962 --> 46:55.421
A silent friend.

46:57.087 --> 47:00.612
A friend that would never
talk back to me or hurt me.

47:00.712 --> 47:04.004
A friend that was always there for me...

47:04.212 --> 47:06.587
and made things better...

47:07.504 --> 47:10.337
even if it was just for a little while.

47:14.295 --> 47:18.004
I would go missing for days
and no one would come looking for me.

47:23.212 --> 47:25.337
Only you, John.

47:25.670 --> 47:28.545
You always came looking for me.

47:30.170 --> 47:32.879
Even when you were a baby.

47:34.295 --> 47:36.420
You still do.

47:40.212 --> 47:43.295
The thing you don't realize, John, is...

47:45.295 --> 47:48.712
I have no one to dance with me anymore.

47:50.795 --> 47:52.920
I'm alone...

47:53.045 --> 47:55.712
and will be for the rest of my life.

48:09.212 --> 48:12.295
I'm tired now, John.
I'm gonna get some sleep.

49:35.629 --> 49:38.129
<i>We need to get you help.</i>

49:39.712 --> 49:42.295
You know what I told you.

49:51.629 --> 49:54.462
I think we've found someone
that can help you.

49:59.004 --> 50:01.587
But you're gonna have to trust me.

51:32.045 --> 51:35.087
We need to go inside, Ma.
We're late as it is.

51:35.420 --> 51:37.795
I'm not goin' in.

51:41.962 --> 51:43.670
Please.

51:43.795 --> 51:46.920
I'm not doin' it. Can't.

51:48.878 --> 51:50.878
- Just give it a go.
- No.

51:51.003 --> 51:53.128
- Please, Ma.
- No, John.

51:53.253 --> 51:56.462
- It's none of their business.
- Well, it's my fucking business, all right?

51:56.587 --> 52:00.337
It's my business,
and I'm fuckin' sick of it!

52:00.462 --> 52:02.570
I'm sick of cleaning up your vomit!

52:02.670 --> 52:07.195
I'm sick of dragging you in off the doorstep
like a fuckin' animal every night!

52:07.295 --> 52:10.278
It's embarrassing me!
It's embarrassing me!

52:10.378 --> 52:13.170
I'm sick of watching you walking around
that corner to work every morning

52:13.295 --> 52:15.087
and not knowin' whether
you're gonna come home

52:15.212 --> 52:19.195
or whether I'm gonna find you in two weeks
face down in a fuckin' ditch somewhere!

52:19.295 --> 52:23.295
And I can't live like that anymore, Ma!
I'm sick of it! I'm fuckin' sick of it!

52:23.420 --> 52:28.753
Sick of it! Sick of it!
I will not fuckin' do it anymore!

52:30.253 --> 52:34.487
You're breakin' my heart every fuckin' day,
and I can't take it!

52:34.587 --> 52:37.378
I can't take it, Ma!

52:39.587 --> 52:43.628
The woman that I live with
in that house is not my mum.

52:43.753 --> 52:48.628
She's not my mum. She's a stranger.
And I won't live there with her anymore!

52:52.212 --> 52:54.712
I want you to watch this.

52:54.837 --> 52:56.837
Okay?

52:56.962 --> 53:00.462
Now, that woman is not my mother.

53:00.587 --> 53:02.112
<i>Give them to me!</i>

53:02.212 --> 53:05.737
My mother laughs and smiles.
She's full of life.

53:05.837 --> 53:08.378
That is not my mother.

53:08.503 --> 53:10.945
That is a fuckin' animal and an impostor.

53:11.045 --> 53:14.420
And one that I will not live with anymore.

53:15.753 --> 53:19.837
But I want my mother back. I need her.

53:23.212 --> 53:27.378
You're breakin' my heart every single day.

53:30.753 --> 53:34.712
I need this to stop, Ma.
We need it to stop.

53:36.462 --> 53:40.420
So if you get to bed tonight
without takin' a drink...

53:41.545 --> 53:43.962
you're saving your life.

53:44.753 --> 53:49.045
And I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna be here for you.

53:50.795 --> 53:53.045
Be here for a week,

53:53.170 --> 53:54.962
and I'm on 24-hour call.

53:55.087 --> 53:59.628
If you need me, just ring up here,
and we can talk.

54:00.920 --> 54:03.503
Because I've been there.

54:06.253 --> 54:08.170
What we're gonna do is just a wee exercise

54:08.295 --> 54:12.295
just so we can fold in
with each other a bit more.

54:12.420 --> 54:15.445
I'll introduce myself...
first-name terms only.

54:15.545 --> 54:19.378
I'll introduce myself,
and you say, "welcome."

54:19.503 --> 54:22.736
And we'll go round the room,
and everybody just say your name,

54:22.836 --> 54:25.795
and we'll welcome you, okay?

54:26.211 --> 54:28.253
So my name's Jim.

54:28.378 --> 54:31.253
- Welcome, Jim.
- Thank you.

56:00.836 --> 56:03.378
<i>John, your mother's dyin'.</i>

56:05.670 --> 56:08.045
But I know you know that.

56:11.086 --> 56:13.820
She's got a disease that's killin' her...

56:13.920 --> 56:16.753
and wants her on her own, drinkin'...

56:16.878 --> 56:19.461
drinkin' herself to death.

56:20.878 --> 56:24.336
This is a terrible disease that she's got.

56:25.211 --> 56:29.670
And the irony of this disease is
it tells her she doesn't have a disease.

56:30.086 --> 56:34.153
Her body's telling her she's dyin'.
It's telling the world that she's dying.

56:34.253 --> 56:38.420
And her brain is tellin' her
to keep on drinkin',

56:38.545 --> 56:40.961
that they don't understand.

56:41.170 --> 56:43.878
Sure, what do they know?

56:45.295 --> 56:50.253
It's mad. It's baffling and cunning.

56:55.253 --> 56:57.461
But there's hope.

56:57.586 --> 57:00.003
There's hope, man.

57:00.128 --> 57:02.711
Especially in your mother.

57:03.795 --> 57:06.295
Do you know how I know?

57:07.586 --> 57:09.920
'Cause she walked in through that door.

57:10.045 --> 57:13.378
Now, I know you probably
cajoled her and threatened her...

57:13.503 --> 57:16.445
and blackmailed her to get her here.

57:16.545 --> 57:19.111
But if she didn't want to walk
through that door, she wouldn't have.

57:19.211 --> 57:23.086
You couldn't have made her,
so there has to be some willin'.

57:23.753 --> 57:28.545
And that's the cornerstone
of her recovery... her willingness.

57:29.503 --> 57:31.961
We've got hope, man.

57:32.378 --> 57:34.878
So we've got a chance.

57:35.003 --> 57:37.586
But here's the borin' bit.

57:37.711 --> 57:40.086
This place is government-run.

57:40.211 --> 57:44.253
We're on a bread-and-water diet.
They got us on a drip feed.

57:46.169 --> 57:50.444
I can only keep her here for, like,
seven to eight days at the very most.

57:50.544 --> 57:52.669
And I promise you I will do that.

57:52.794 --> 57:56.253
And I'll give her all the facilities
that we have got.

57:57.211 --> 58:00.669
But she's got to find
somewhere else after those seven days.

58:05.378 --> 58:07.836
I can't afford it.

58:10.753 --> 58:14.944
I'm trying really hard. I'm trying
to get the hours at work, but I can't.

58:15.044 --> 58:17.544
They're just not there.

58:20.461 --> 58:23.294
I'm just spinnin' my wheels. That's it.

58:23.419 --> 58:26.169
It's like every day is the same day.

58:27.169 --> 58:31.086
I'll help you.
I'm gonna make phone calls for you.

58:31.211 --> 58:34.253
I'll rattle cages. I'll see what it'll do.

58:34.378 --> 58:37.986
But most of the work has to come
from you, brother. I'm sorry.

58:38.086 --> 58:40.919
You've gotta find it from somewhere.

58:43.669 --> 58:46.378
What about any health insurance?

58:46.878 --> 58:48.794
No.

58:49.419 --> 58:52.003
Nobody you can ask a favor of?

58:52.711 --> 58:55.044
Not anymore.

01:02:45.419 --> 01:02:47.377
Mmm.

01:02:51.461 --> 01:02:53.294
Listen, I had a phone call from a mate.

01:02:53.419 --> 01:02:55.961
He's got a private clinic
in the outskirts of town.

01:02:56.086 --> 01:03:00.252
And he's got a room free.
Twenty-eight days as well.

01:03:01.252 --> 01:03:05.586
- That's if you still want it.
- All right, great. It's free?

01:03:05.711 --> 01:03:09.461
No. Nothing's free with this bloke.

01:03:10.294 --> 01:03:14.877
It's eight grand,
and that's the mate's rate as well.

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:21.694
I know, man, but he needs to know
by the end of the day.

01:03:21.794 --> 01:03:26.419
That's her only hope.
John, honestly, I've tried everywhere.

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:28.711
Look...

01:03:29.336 --> 01:03:31.169
- it's not much.
- I can't.

01:03:31.294 --> 01:03:33.152
- I want you to take it.
- I can't.

01:03:33.252 --> 01:03:36.086
Just take...
take the fucking thing, will ya?

01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:38.461
Just take it.

01:03:38.919 --> 01:03:42.169
I always put a wee bit aside
for people who need it.

01:03:42.794 --> 01:03:48.211
You're a good man, John. You've been
of loving service to your mother.

01:03:48.336 --> 01:03:51.002
I really appreciate that.

01:03:51.586 --> 01:03:55.961
I know what you're going through.
And I wanna help.

01:03:56.377 --> 01:03:57.794
Okay?

01:04:19.544 --> 01:04:21.836
It's John here.

01:04:22.502 --> 01:04:25.461
I was wondering if you had
any work going tonight.

01:04:27.002 --> 01:04:29.794
Yeah, well, I know, but I'm...

01:04:36.127 --> 01:04:38.044
Yeah.

01:04:39.627 --> 01:04:42.002
We need the money.

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:46.860
Look, I just need something
to tide me over for the week.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.669
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

01:04:50.627 --> 01:04:55.127
I haven't let you down in the past. And I
wouldn't be ringing you if I wasn't stuck.

01:04:58.419 --> 01:05:00.585
Eight grand.

01:05:03.294 --> 01:05:05.210
Yeah.

01:05:15.752 --> 01:05:18.169
If I have to, yeah.

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:41.585
Well?

01:05:42.335 --> 01:05:45.044
- Yeah.
- Good man.

01:05:45.169 --> 01:05:48.377
- Do you want a hand?
- Yeah, please.

01:05:48.502 --> 01:05:51.544
It's on the back here.
Stack 'em in threes.

01:06:02.585 --> 01:06:04.585
Shit.

01:06:48.085 --> 01:06:49.044
Nice bag.

01:06:49.169 --> 01:06:52.194
They'll never suspect a man walking
around the airport with a woman's bag.

01:06:52.294 --> 01:06:56.002
- One minute.
- Aw, Jesus Christ.

01:06:57.835 --> 01:07:00.169
Jesus Christ.

01:07:01.335 --> 01:07:04.919
Let's throw some holy water on you. Okay.

01:07:05.169 --> 01:07:07.085
Okay.

01:07:08.877 --> 01:07:11.544
- I love you, son.
- I know that.

01:07:14.252 --> 01:07:17.069
Jesus. Bridie, no.

01:07:17.169 --> 01:07:22.627
I must take a picture of you before you go.
John, will you stand in for a photo?

01:07:23.835 --> 01:07:27.319
There's no shame in a mother's
love, Shane. Now smile.

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:29.335
Sick.

01:07:30.169 --> 01:07:34.252
All right. Come on. We better get
on the road. We'll be late otherwise.

01:07:36.669 --> 01:07:38.444
Where's Da?

01:07:38.544 --> 01:07:42.294
He wouldn't go out.
He can't do that. You know him.

01:07:42.419 --> 01:07:46.460
Okay. Look, I better go. I'll be late.

01:07:46.585 --> 01:07:48.794
Time I said good-bye.

01:07:50.877 --> 01:07:53.627
All right. Let's go.

01:07:53.752 --> 01:07:56.460
- Have you got your passport?
- Yeah.

01:07:56.585 --> 01:07:59.960
- Have you got your passport?
- Yeah.

01:08:00.085 --> 01:08:02.777
You don't, because I have it.

01:08:02.877 --> 01:08:04.877
Fuck.

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:06.777
- Thanks.
- Love you.

01:08:06.877 --> 01:08:09.794
Love you too. Bye.

01:08:10.377 --> 01:08:12.793
Drive the fucking car, man.

01:08:13.168 --> 01:08:15.502
The woman is fucking crazy.

01:08:15.668 --> 01:08:18.443
Leave her alone. She'll miss her baby.

01:08:18.542 --> 01:08:22.127
Will you stop? I'm under enough
stress without you gettin' on me.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.777
I'll do you a good deal
on the meter, all right?

01:08:27.877 --> 01:08:29.585
- Prick, you know what I...
- Do you, now?

01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:32.877
Just go fast, 'cause Bridie will chase
the fucking car, I tell you that.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:47.835
- Why are we leaving so early?
- I've a little surprise for you, man. Relax.

01:09:39.335 --> 01:09:42.502
Hey. How's it going?

01:09:42.627 --> 01:09:46.167
- Hi, Jackie.
- Dad!

01:09:47.627 --> 01:09:51.167
- What's up, huh?
- I've been waiting for you.

01:09:53.085 --> 01:09:55.502
How are you, man?

01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:00.693
- I don't know.
- Uh-huh.

01:10:00.793 --> 01:10:02.918
Blowin' bubbles.

01:10:08.668 --> 01:10:10.752
- Everything going all right?
- Yeah, we're good.

01:10:10.877 --> 01:10:14.002
Grand. Grand.

01:10:25.585 --> 01:10:28.193
- Yeah!
- Good save, man.

01:10:28.293 --> 01:10:30.377
Yeah!

01:10:30.877 --> 01:10:33.752
Get it. Ready?

01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:36.418
Yeah. Good man.

01:10:36.543 --> 01:10:38.110
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:40.360
- Go!
- Get it for me.

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.585
All right, love.

01:10:43.418 --> 01:10:45.960
See you soon, all right?

01:10:50.085 --> 01:10:52.168
All right.

01:11:44.585 --> 01:11:47.043
Give us a ring on the phone
when you have the time, will you?

01:11:47.168 --> 01:11:50.543
- Will do, man. Yeah.
- I'll keep you up-to-date.

01:11:52.418 --> 01:11:55.376
I'll call you on the house phone
or the mobile, will I?

01:11:55.543 --> 01:11:59.668
- Mobile would probably be best.
- Better on the mobile. Grand.

01:12:03.126 --> 01:12:06.085
- All right. Come on. Here we go.
- All right.

01:12:16.668 --> 01:12:18.668
Right.

01:12:24.501 --> 01:12:27.626
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah, I'll grab it.

01:12:28.168 --> 01:12:30.293
Thanks, man.

01:12:31.043 --> 01:12:33.793
- You have it?
- I'm grand.

01:12:41.501 --> 01:12:44.376
Ah. You were a daft fucking thing anyway.

01:12:46.543 --> 01:12:48.418
All right. I walk you in?

01:12:48.543 --> 01:12:52.460
No, I'm grand.
I'll take it from here. Yeah.

01:12:53.085 --> 01:12:57.251
- Okay, well, I better be going, so...
- Yeah, me too.

01:12:59.418 --> 01:13:02.043
Be careful anyway.
Don't get into too much trouble without me.

01:13:02.168 --> 01:13:05.960
Don't think we'd be able to get
into any trouble without you at all.

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.126
I better, uh...

01:13:10.251 --> 01:13:14.043
Here, come on. I'll walk you in.
I'll walk you in. Come on.

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.710
All right. Good man. Mind yourself.

01:13:24.835 --> 01:13:26.418
Yeah.

01:13:31.626 --> 01:13:32.918
- Good luck, man.
- Yeah.

01:13:33.043 --> 01:13:35.918
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:13:38.376 --> 01:13:41.001
Hey, go easy on the AIDS, man, all right?

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:43.376
Yeah, I'll try me best.

01:13:47.418 --> 01:13:49.960
Hey, you should've come, man.

01:13:50.335 --> 01:13:52.293
I know.

01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:55.168
If only I would've had a fucking passport.

01:13:55.293 --> 01:13:57.251
That's shockin'.

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:04.251
Well, you have a place to go, man.

01:14:04.626 --> 01:14:06.543
It's just a click.

01:14:06.668 --> 01:14:10.735
Yeah, go on. "Take a hike, fuckhead."

01:14:10.835 --> 01:14:12.751
Take a hike, fuckhead.

01:16:00.334 --> 01:16:03.418
Good man. See you later, all right?

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:29.626
How are you now?

01:17:31.584 --> 01:17:34.126
I know what day it is.

01:17:35.626 --> 01:17:37.793
It's Sunday.

01:17:38.918 --> 01:17:41.543
It's fucking Monday, Ma.

01:17:57.626 --> 01:17:59.751
Can't promise you anything.

01:18:03.959 --> 01:18:05.876
I know.

01:19:12.792 --> 01:19:14.709
Yeah?

01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:17.376
Yeah, thanks.

01:19:19.042 --> 01:19:20.876
Yeah.

01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:25.001
Yeah.

01:19:36.584 --> 01:19:38.917
Yeah, okay, I'll do it.

01:26:14.833 --> 01:26:17.417
<i>It's been a long night.</i>

01:26:17.875 --> 01:26:20.542
<i>Had a few difficult clients.</i>

01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:25.333
<i>Worked a lot of hours.</i>

01:26:28.833 --> 01:26:31.417
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

01:26:34.167 --> 01:26:36.333
<i>I can't.</i>
