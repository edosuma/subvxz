Previously on "Ex on the Beach":

00:03.670 --> 00:06.606
Cory's ex Alicia, who was
previously cut from the house,

00:06.673 --> 00:08.441
washed back up on the beach
as a new single,

00:08.508 --> 00:12.212
which means Cory's new girl
Taylor and her nemesis Angela

00:12.278 --> 00:14.080
are forced to deal with her.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.416
{\an5}Me and Alicia still
have a lot that we
need to figure out.

00:16.483 --> 00:17.751
(announcer)
The Shack of Secrets

00:17.817 --> 00:19.986
exposed Victoria's lies
to Luis.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.421
<i>While I was talking to him,</i>

00:21.488 --> 00:23.690
<i>I was hooking up</i>
<i>with somebody else.</i>

00:23.757 --> 00:25.158
(announcer)
And after Chris's ex Haley

00:25.225 --> 00:27.427
started getting
too close to Derrick,

00:27.494 --> 00:29.596
Chris got the house
to send her packing.

00:29.662 --> 00:31.231
I honestly want you to get
the (bleep) out of my face.

00:31.297 --> 00:33.733
{\an1}Well, that's
the closure, I guess.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.068
I guess it is.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.336
{\an8}(announcer)
And tonight, Chase continues

00:36.403 --> 00:38.171
{\an8}to play mind games
with Victoria.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.906
And Paulie and Lexi's old wounds

00:39.973 --> 00:42.709
are reopened
in the Shack of Secrets.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.245
{\an1}You didn't have the balls
to come to me as a (bleep) man!

00:45.311 --> 00:46.446
{\an1}Don't bring that bull(bleep)
into here.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.915
No, that's
the (bleep) truth!

{\an5}(announcer)
Welcome back.
Here's where we're at.

01:10.470 --> 01:13.273
{\an8}Cory's ex Alicia
is back on the beach,

01:13.339 --> 01:15.475
{\an8}sending the whole villa
up in arms.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.377
{\an7}Everybody should
be shook.

01:17.444 --> 01:20.313
{\an8}Cory's finally being honest
about his feelings for her,

01:20.380 --> 01:22.315
{\an8}which sends Taylor
over the edge.

01:22.382 --> 01:23.917
{\an8}Victoria's made peace
with Luis

01:23.983 --> 01:26.719
{\an8}and is angling to rekindle
things with Chase.

01:26.786 --> 01:29.189
{\an8}You can scratch my back
all day, every day.

01:29.255 --> 01:32.292
{\an8}(announcer)
Faith and June are hot and heavy
in the bedroom,

01:32.358 --> 01:33.993
{\an8}but outside the bedroom,

01:34.060 --> 01:36.863
{\an8}a lack of romance is becoming
a turn-off for Faith.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.265
{\an8}He's not giving me all the
attention that I want right now,

01:39.332 --> 01:41.000
{\an8}to be completely honest
with you.

01:41.067 --> 01:42.035
(announcer)
And Lexi and Paulie

01:42.101 --> 01:43.670
continue to make progress

01:43.736 --> 01:46.172
despite Lexi's doubts
about Paulie.

01:48.575 --> 01:51.177
All you coupled-up ones
can go now.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.412
{\an1}(Lexi)
Uh, no.

01:52.479 --> 01:54.414
{\an5}(laughing)

01:52.479 --> 01:54.414
No chance in hell.

01:54.481 --> 01:57.350
{\an8}Paulie and I are in a very
good place and moving forward.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.886
But the fact of the matter is,
he hurt me.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.188
He lied, deceived, cheated.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.523
We're exclusive,
we're dating.

02:03.590 --> 02:04.891
Like, you're telling me
you love me,

02:04.958 --> 02:07.093
and I have to find out
from social media

02:07.160 --> 02:09.095
that, like,
there's someone else.

02:09.162 --> 02:12.332
So I am trying
to be vulnerable enough

02:12.398 --> 02:14.968
for him to be able to build
that trust with me.

02:15.034 --> 02:16.369
Well,
hypothetically speaking,

02:16.436 --> 02:17.770
you guys go home tomorrow.

02:17.837 --> 02:19.239
Are you guys gonna--

02:19.305 --> 02:21.274
are you, like, in
a relationship right now?

02:23.743 --> 02:27.146
{\an5}(announcer)
Oh, way to put your boy
on the spot, Chase.

02:27.213 --> 02:28.314
{\an1}If I were
to come out of here,

02:28.381 --> 02:29.816
{\an1}I'm claiming you
outside of the house.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.919
{\an1}You know what I mean?
If that's okay with you.

02:34.621 --> 02:35.822
{\an1}Are you asking me
to be your girlfriend

02:35.889 --> 02:37.323
{\an1}in front of all these people?
What the heck?

02:37.390 --> 02:38.992
{\an5}Um...

02:37.390 --> 02:38.992
Yeah, I'm about it.

02:39.058 --> 02:40.793
Say it. What?

02:40.860 --> 02:43.396
(all "oohing")

02:43.463 --> 02:45.398
{\an1}Well, first, I mean
I do want that, so...

02:45.465 --> 02:47.367
(woman)
So you guys are dating now.

02:47.433 --> 02:49.903
(overlapping chatter
and applause)

02:49.969 --> 02:52.005
{\an5}(Derrick)
Paulie making it official
with Lexi,

02:52.071 --> 02:53.473
I almost broke into tears.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.308
I love both of them
together,

02:55.375 --> 02:57.176
{\an8}so maybe this
"Ex on the Beach" thing

02:57.243 --> 02:59.479
{\an8}can really help some
relationships out.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.415
{\an5}(announcer)
Ah, young love.
Ain't that sweet?

03:02.482 --> 03:04.951
On the other hand,
Faith isn't feeling the love

03:05.018 --> 03:06.653
from her man June.

03:06.719 --> 03:08.521
I feel like
you're more focused

03:08.588 --> 03:10.723
on your friendships
and relationships,

03:10.790 --> 03:13.593
and I'm showing it more.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.994
And then you're not
doing it back to me,

03:15.061 --> 03:16.296
and that's something
that I have to

03:16.362 --> 03:18.197
take in consideration
when I'm dating someone.

03:18.264 --> 03:19.465
When we had that night,

03:19.532 --> 03:21.568
{\an1}you did have more feelings
for me than I did.

03:21.634 --> 03:24.504
{\an1}But I can't force myself
to catch up with you

03:24.571 --> 03:26.539
{\an1}because then
it won't be real.

03:26.606 --> 03:29.609
{\an8}I'm not feeling
the reciprocation

03:29.676 --> 03:31.277
{\an8}that I'm giving out
this moment.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.646
{\an1}So I feel like I'm in
a little conundrum with you.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.782
{\an1}I feel like I'm in
a little predicament.

03:35.848 --> 03:37.050
{\an8}I'm not the type of guy

03:37.116 --> 03:38.985
{\an8}to just go head over heels
with somebody

03:39.052 --> 03:41.621
{\an8}because I just don't
fall in love that fast.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.256
I mean, at the end
of the day,

03:43.323 --> 03:45.658
{\an5}I know who I am.

03:43.323 --> 03:45.658
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.860
And I know
what I deserve.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.897
{\an5}(announcer)
June, you should probably
stop taking Faith for granted

03:50.964 --> 03:52.599
before she moves on.

03:52.665 --> 03:54.434
And someone else
who might just be ready

03:54.500 --> 03:56.569
to move on is Angela.

03:56.636 --> 04:00.273
I'm gonna talk
to Alicia soon.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.674
{\an5}(Victoria)
What are you
gonna say?

04:01.741 --> 04:03.876
Are you gonna have
a civilized conversation?

04:03.943 --> 04:04.944
Yeah. Yeah.

04:05.011 --> 04:07.380
Well, I'm gonna try.

04:07.447 --> 04:08.715
{\an5}Try your best, sweetie.

04:07.447 --> 04:08.715
{\an1}Okay.

04:08.781 --> 04:09.916
(Angela)
Not only does Alicia

04:09.983 --> 04:11.250
come back into this house,

04:11.317 --> 04:13.286
{\an8}she comes in screaming
that she's an O.G.

04:13.353 --> 04:14.587
I'm a O.G. now!

04:14.654 --> 04:16.689
This is breaking news
right now!

04:16.755 --> 04:19.659
My eyes are so puffy
from Tor'i leaving,

04:19.726 --> 04:22.695
the whole Alicia situation
needs to be squashed.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.430
It's like there's an elephant
in the room at all times.

04:24.497 --> 04:26.733
Yeah, and it's like
we have enough drama

04:26.799 --> 04:29.535
{\an1}dealing with our exes,
I don't need female drama, too.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.404
{\an1}I don't know, I feel like
it would, like,

04:31.471 --> 04:32.572
{\an1}make me feel better
in a way,

04:32.639 --> 04:34.374
{\an1}because I've had
to deal with so much.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.076
{\an4}Like, this is the last
(bleep) thing on earth I need.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.076
{\an3}Yeah. Yeah.

04:37.143 --> 04:39.312
I'm over it.

04:39.379 --> 04:40.813
(announcer)
As the singles say their prayers

04:40.880 --> 04:43.616
in hopes of no more
exes arriving,

04:43.683 --> 04:45.718
the morning brings
Paulie and Chase

04:45.785 --> 04:49.288
attempting to slide into
a new day on the right foot.

04:49.355 --> 04:52.025
{\an5}Every time we have,
like, a meeting or
we talk about it...

04:53.493 --> 04:55.395
{\an5}Oh, what's up, everyone?

04:53.493 --> 04:55.395
Oh, ready, ready, rise!

04:55.461 --> 04:56.429
We gotta listen up
right now.

04:56.496 --> 04:57.897
What the (bleep)?

04:57.964 --> 04:59.332
Listen up, listen up.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.366
(man)
What up, what up, what up?

05:00.433 --> 05:02.769
Chase and I are
sick and tired

05:02.835 --> 05:04.937
{\an1}of everybody being
cooped up in this house.

05:05.004 --> 05:06.105
{\an6}Same! Same!

05:05.004 --> 05:06.105
{\an1}True!

05:06.172 --> 05:09.042
So we decided
to throw y'all a party.

05:09.108 --> 05:10.109
So we got you guys a keg!

05:10.176 --> 05:11.844
(cheering and applause)

05:11.911 --> 05:12.845
Yeah!

05:12.912 --> 05:15.748
We're gonna set
this (bleep) up!

05:16.883 --> 05:18.284
Oh, my God.

05:18.351 --> 05:20.486
{\an5}(Chase)
I been working my ass off
for this body,

05:20.553 --> 05:22.055
{\an8}and it's kind of like,
why would a millionaire

05:22.121 --> 05:24.490
{\an8}buy a Ferrari just to park it
in the garage?

05:24.557 --> 05:25.792
I'm gonna throw
a Speedo on,

05:25.858 --> 05:27.894
and I'm gonna show
this damn thing off.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.529
Look at that body!

05:29.595 --> 05:31.064
(overlapping chatter)

05:31.130 --> 05:33.199
{\an8}Chase in Speedos,
that's all I need to see.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.235
{\an8}And then that's
a good day for me.

05:36.302 --> 05:38.638

Hey, Gucci Gang,

07:28.381 --> 07:29.882
hope you enjoyed the morning,

07:29.949 --> 07:33.820
because more exes
are on the way right now.

07:34.987 --> 07:36.489
(Derrick)
It's flag time.

07:36.556 --> 07:37.757

Flags are goin' up!

(Faith)
Who's on top?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.127
Faith.
Faith, that's you!

07:41.194 --> 07:42.461
Oh, Faith.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.798
When I saw
my face on the flag,

07:45.865 --> 07:47.800
I look over at June
and his face is just

07:47.867 --> 07:50.636
{\an8}shockingly like,
like, concerned.

07:50.703 --> 07:52.171
(Lexi)
Angela's on top.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.472
Yes! That's me.

07:53.539 --> 07:54.974
{\an1}(Faith)
It's Paulie Paul!

07:55.041 --> 07:57.577
{\an8}Just when I make things
official with Lexi,

07:57.643 --> 07:59.512
my face shows up on the flag,

07:59.579 --> 08:01.814
and this is really
the last thing I need.

08:01.881 --> 08:03.983
I really hope none of my exes
are coming here.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.184
Do you think
another ex is coming?

08:05.251 --> 08:06.652
{\an6}No.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.652
I'm nervous.

08:06.719 --> 08:08.387
I just have
a bad feeling.

08:08.454 --> 08:10.556

My first impressions of Marcus

{\an8}is he is a 100% Cali bro.

his intentions is with you?

he was trying to be cool.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.592
{\an8}(Derrick)
Marcus is coming in hot,

22:40.659 --> 22:44.129
{\an8}and if it's one thing
I can tell America,

22:44.196 --> 22:46.732
{\an8}you'd don't
wanna cross Angela.

22:46.798 --> 22:50.235
(bleep) off!
No, you (bleep) off!

22:50.302 --> 22:52.671
Cross your mama,
cross your daddy.

22:52.738 --> 22:54.940
You don't wanna cross
Angela.

22:55.006 --> 22:57.242
{\an8}I'm tired of you,
I'm tired of you
talking to me.

22:57.309 --> 22:59.311
{\an8}(bleep) off, yo!
(bleep) off!

22:59.377 --> 23:00.445
{\an8}Just pack your bags
before you get sent home.

23:00.512 --> 23:01.913
Have another shot,
baby girl.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.248
Shut the (bleep) up, yo.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.117
Get this (bleep) bitch
away from me.

23:05.183 --> 23:07.452
Swear to God,
before I pop off.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.724
(bleep) off!
Go home!

23:12.791 --> 23:14.092
Just pack your bags
before you get sent home.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.127
Have another shot,
baby girl.

23:15.193 --> 23:16.728
{\an8}Shut the (bleep) up!

23:18.663 --> 23:20.332
{\an8}No. She is dramatic.

23:18.663 --> 23:20.332
{\an8}Just come here.

23:20.398 --> 23:22.367
{\an4}(Faith)
Just come here.
Come here, come here.

23:22.434 --> 23:24.236
(overlapping chatter)

23:24.302 --> 23:25.537
I literally don't know
why that happened.

23:25.604 --> 23:28.640
{\an1}I haven't said a world--
a word to that girl.

23:28.707 --> 23:29.775
You good, man?

23:29.841 --> 23:31.343
{\an5}(Marcus)
You guys are
really dramatic.

23:31.409 --> 23:33.278
{\an5}Yeah, welcome
to the house.

23:31.409 --> 23:33.278
{\an3}Yeah. Very.

23:33.345 --> 23:34.646
{\an8}Marcus doesn't have a filter,

23:34.713 --> 23:36.848
{\an8}but I need him to turn
that filter on.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.151
Valencia, XX Pro...

23:39.217 --> 23:41.052
any filter he--
Instagram can get.

23:41.119 --> 23:44.022
Because my friends will not
be disrespected, I'm sorry.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.423
{\an1}(laughing)
This (bleep) is wack.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.292
Okay, so come here
and lay down, bro.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.661
{\an1}All right, homey.
You (bleep) do you.

23:49.728 --> 23:51.963
{\an8}And Marcus should not have
pissed all those people off

23:52.030 --> 23:54.866
{\an8}the way he did, 'cause
it's a bad look for me, too.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.468
Marcus has dug his grave.

23:56.535 --> 23:58.069
But if he's gonna
(bleep) my life up,

23:58.136 --> 23:59.538
then he can get
the (bleep) out of here.

24:00.872 --> 24:02.674
(announcer)
As night falls on the villa,

24:02.741 --> 24:06.311
any hope that Marcus had
of reconnecting with Faith

24:06.378 --> 24:09.548
just went up in flames.
Better luck next time.

24:09.614 --> 24:10.816
But things aren't
all bad.

24:10.882 --> 24:12.517
It looks like
the flames of passion

24:12.584 --> 24:15.620
between Paulie and Lexi
are still growing strong.

24:23.929 --> 24:26.665
(shower running)

24:28.099 --> 24:30.202
(Lexi)
Yeah.

24:31.269 --> 24:32.838
Oh, (bleep).

24:32.904 --> 24:33.905
{\an8}(Lexi breathing hard)

24:36.808 --> 24:38.343
(announcer)
Looks like Paulie

24:38.410 --> 24:41.646
already put his crush vote
in the pineapple.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.181
{\an5}Oh.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.181
Oh!

24:43.248 --> 24:45.750
(both laughing)

24:45.817 --> 24:48.186
{\an1}(Paulie, laughing)
No heads up, Derrick?

24:49.154 --> 24:50.789
(all laughing)

24:52.324 --> 24:54.659
They're like--
(laughing)

24:54.726 --> 24:56.294
I wasn't doing
anything.

24:56.361 --> 24:58.063
I'm innocent until
proven guilty

24:58.129 --> 24:59.698
in a court of law.

24:59.764 --> 25:02.667
(announcer)
Uh, maybe just plead the Fifth.

25:02.734 --> 25:04.369
♪♪

25:04.436 --> 25:08.440
(loud snoring)

25:11.009 --> 25:13.478
(snoring continues)

25:14.913 --> 25:17.616
(laughter)

25:17.682 --> 25:19.251
(Derrick)
Look at his eyes.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.486
{\an5}Look at his eyes.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.486
Are they rolling back
right now?

25:21.553 --> 25:23.455
{\an5}(Derrick)
June is asleep
with one eye open.

25:23.521 --> 25:25.757
I see you. You can see me,
but you sleep.

25:25.824 --> 25:27.859
(Derrick)
I'm like, what the hell?

25:27.926 --> 25:29.761
{\an8}I'ma (bleep) with him
a little bit.

25:29.828 --> 25:31.563
(snoring)

25:32.931 --> 25:34.799
(woman laughing)

25:42.540 --> 25:44.976
{\an5}Just cuddle up next to...

25:42.540 --> 25:44.976
That's a sexy bra, too.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.545
(snoring continues)

25:52.117 --> 25:53.418
{\an8}(shrieking laugh)

25:53.485 --> 25:56.488
Wake up to the booty,
come on, bro.

25:56.554 --> 25:59.124
And it's still
not working.

25:59.190 --> 26:00.392
Make it clap, girl.

26:00.458 --> 26:01.559
{\an5}Make it clap.

26:00.458 --> 26:01.559
Make it clap.

26:01.626 --> 26:03.561
{\an4}Bro...

26:01.626 --> 26:03.561
{\an3}(snoring)

26:05.330 --> 26:07.832
{\an5}(announcer)
While June is out cold
sleeping it off,

26:07.899 --> 26:11.569
the Shack of Secrets is ready
to turn up the heat.

26:11.636 --> 26:12.504
{\an3}Oh, boy!

26:12.570 --> 26:14.873
Are you (bleep) kidding me?

26:14.940 --> 26:16.308
(snoring)

26:17.609 --> 26:19.978
{\an8}Every time I see or hear
that elevator,

26:20.045 --> 26:21.546
I know that (bleep)
is about to happen,

26:21.613 --> 26:22.847
whether it's good or bad.

26:22.914 --> 26:26.484
So... I'm just
obviously nervous.

26:29.387 --> 26:30.588
Wait, wait, wait.

26:30.655 --> 26:32.590
"Paulie and Lexi,
sometimes you need

26:32.657 --> 26:35.727
"to slide into the past
to get the direct message.

26:35.794 --> 26:36.795
Please head down
to the Shack of Secrets."

26:36.861 --> 26:38.863
{\an4}(woman)
Oh, no.

26:36.861 --> 26:38.863
Oh, (bleep).

26:38.930 --> 26:40.565
"And tonight there will be
an elimination."

26:40.632 --> 26:41.933
{\an5}(Derrick)
Paulie and Lexi
are my favorite couple,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.569
so hearing that Paulie and Lexi
has to go down

26:44.636 --> 26:46.504
{\an8}to the Shack of Secrets,
I'm hurting right now.

26:46.571 --> 26:47.806
I'm just hoping nothing
happens

26:47.872 --> 26:49.975
that's gonna cause
any drama between them.

26:50.041 --> 26:53.311
Nothing good comes from
the Shack of Secrets.

26:53.378 --> 26:54.512
Good luck.

26:54.579 --> 26:57.482
(ominous music plays)

27:03.188 --> 27:04.756
{\an4}(Derrick)
Whatcha all think's
about to happen?

27:04.823 --> 27:06.224
{\an5}(Victoria)
I think his ex
is down there.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.392
{\an1}(Derrick)
I don't think so.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.594
{\an1}Only thing I'm thinking
is he or she

27:09.661 --> 27:12.497
{\an7}DM'd other people while
they were together in the pack.

27:14.032 --> 27:16.368
{\an8}Being boyfriend and girlfriend
is-- it's a good feeling.

27:16.434 --> 27:18.937
And no drama,
no Shack of (bleep) Secrets

27:19.004 --> 27:22.941
can break us up.
But I am feeling nervous.

27:25.510 --> 27:28.179
"Lexi, on the table
is Paulie's phone.

27:28.246 --> 27:29.647
"You'll be able
to do what you--

27:29.714 --> 27:31.349
Oh, my God.
"You'll be able to do

27:31.416 --> 27:33.585
"what every ex
would love to do.

27:33.651 --> 27:36.354
"Go through it.
You have seven minutes.

27:36.421 --> 27:37.655
Paulie, unlock your phone."

27:37.722 --> 27:39.057
(Paulie)
Ah, (bleep).

27:39.124 --> 27:41.993
My phone definitely holds
a lot of secrets,

27:42.060 --> 27:43.728
and I'm a little nervous.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.163
{\an8}I feel like there's gonna
be some trouble.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.532
Okay, go ahead.
Lift it up.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.605
{\an8}The only thing I want
to see is conversations

27:53.671 --> 27:56.007
{\an8}between him and the girl
that he cheated on me with.

27:56.074 --> 27:57.909
He did talk to her
while he was with me,

27:57.976 --> 27:59.844
so I want to see
what was said.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.583
My heart is in my stomach
right now.

28:07.652 --> 28:08.887
Oh, wait, here we go.

28:08.953 --> 28:11.289
"You can text me when
you're home if you want.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.424
"I'm glad I saw
your face today.

28:12.490 --> 28:13.792
"I was starting
to miss you too much

28:13.858 --> 28:16.428
thinking about you."
That was August 16th.

28:16.494 --> 28:18.463
So this is while
you're still telling me

28:18.530 --> 28:21.166
that you miss me
and love me.

28:21.232 --> 28:23.635
Like four days from...

28:23.701 --> 28:25.170
Mm-hmm, "You should be
in bed with me,

28:25.236 --> 28:27.105
{\an1}not finishing the ice cream
in your freezer."

28:30.141 --> 28:31.743
That's on August 14th.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.011
Oh, and you guys
are planning

28:33.078 --> 28:35.146
your trip to Austin
on August 13th?

28:35.213 --> 28:36.648
You guys are planning
a (bleep) trip together

28:36.714 --> 28:38.583
before you even
broke up with me?

28:39.717 --> 28:40.985
Like, you're literally
texting me

28:41.052 --> 28:42.387
saying that you love me
and like you're planning

28:42.454 --> 28:43.922
a (bleep) trip
with someone else?

28:43.988 --> 28:45.457
This is so much more than
you ever (bleep) told me!

28:45.523 --> 28:46.591
You're right.

28:46.658 --> 28:48.226
{\an1}Do you want to get
hurt like that

28:48.293 --> 28:49.627
when a breakup happens?

28:49.694 --> 28:51.896
{\an1}I mean, I told you that
feelings just weren't there.

28:51.963 --> 28:55.266
{\an1}You didn't (bleep) say that
until you cheated on me!

28:55.333 --> 28:56.901
You never said that!

28:56.968 --> 28:58.436
Instead, you're planning
a (bleep) trip

28:58.503 --> 28:59.637
with another girl?

28:59.704 --> 29:01.439
How you treated her,
you were treating me

29:01.506 --> 29:02.774
the same exact way!

29:02.841 --> 29:04.109
{\an1}I had my reserves
about us,

29:04.175 --> 29:05.310
and I'm sorry that I...

29:05.376 --> 29:06.444
You should've
(bleep) said that!

29:06.511 --> 29:07.512
Because, you know what?

29:07.579 --> 29:08.746
There was someone else's
emotions

29:08.813 --> 29:10.348
involved in this,
not just yours!

29:10.415 --> 29:11.649
She has some pipes.

29:11.716 --> 29:12.984
(muffled arguing)

29:13.051 --> 29:14.452
Well, congratulations.
You got your cake

29:14.519 --> 29:15.920
and you got to (bleep)
eat it, too.

29:15.987 --> 29:17.956
{\an5}No, not really.

29:15.987 --> 29:17.956
{\an3}Not really?

29:18.022 --> 29:19.657
{\an5}No, not really.

29:18.022 --> 29:19.657
{\an3}How so?

29:19.724 --> 29:20.992
{\an5}Okay, we were there...

29:19.724 --> 29:20.992
I was just chillin'

29:21.059 --> 29:22.227
on the (bleep) back burner
for you, dude.

29:22.293 --> 29:23.428
{\an1}If you will shut
the (bleep) up

29:23.495 --> 29:24.796
and let me talk
for two seconds.

29:24.863 --> 29:25.930
Don't--
I don't deserve that.

29:25.997 --> 29:27.432
{\an1}I'm not gonna give you
every detail.

29:27.499 --> 29:28.600
For future reference,
if you're telling a girl

29:28.666 --> 29:30.568
that you love her,
she deserves to know

29:30.635 --> 29:32.036
if you're off (bleep)
another girl

29:32.103 --> 29:33.338
and telling you--
telling her

29:33.404 --> 29:34.739
that you love her, too.

29:34.806 --> 29:35.740
She deserves that respect
and you know what,

29:35.807 --> 29:37.142
I never did anything
to you.

29:37.208 --> 29:38.910
You're just gonna assume
that I was (bleep) a girl

29:38.977 --> 29:40.011
{\an4}the entire time
up until your birthday.

29:38.977 --> 29:40.011
Are you kidding?

29:40.078 --> 29:41.212
You should be--
You were!

29:41.279 --> 29:42.514
{\an4}Shh!

29:41.279 --> 29:42.514
{\an3}She's fine.

29:42.580 --> 29:43.648
{\an5}She's yelling.

29:42.580 --> 29:43.648
She's yelling right now.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.116
{\an1}(Paulie)
Because I (bleep) did.

29:45.183 --> 29:46.985
You didn't have the balls to
come to me as a (bleep) man

29:47.051 --> 29:48.453
{\an5}and tell me how
you felt about me.

29:47.051 --> 29:48.453
{\an1}I did.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.988
{\an1}Don't bring that
bull(bleep) into here.

29:50.054 --> 29:52.223
No, that's-- that's
the (bleep) truth!

29:57.228 --> 29:59.831
You didn't have the balls to
come to me as a (bleep) man

29:59.898 --> 30:01.366
{\an5}and tell me how
you felt about me.

29:59.898 --> 30:01.366
{\an1}I did.

30:01.432 --> 30:03.001
{\an1}Don't bring that
bull(bleep) into here.

30:03.067 --> 30:05.236
No, that's-- that's
the (bleep) truth!

30:05.303 --> 30:06.704
(muffled arguing)

30:06.771 --> 30:07.972
(Lexi)
You did it.

30:08.039 --> 30:09.707
You did not come to me
and say that.

30:09.774 --> 30:12.043
Good thing my exes
are gone!

30:12.110 --> 30:13.745
(growling)
Yeah!

30:13.811 --> 30:15.613
After I found out
you cheated on me, yes!

30:15.680 --> 30:17.182
{\an1}I handled this
completely wrong.

30:17.248 --> 30:19.050
I apologize.
I (bleep) up.

30:19.117 --> 30:20.618
I feel like an idiot
for even giving you

30:20.685 --> 30:21.819
another chance,
honestly.

30:21.886 --> 30:23.488
There's two choices.
There's two choices.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.356
{\an1}It's like
you can either...

30:25.423 --> 30:27.559
{\an1}believe in what's been
going on here,

30:27.625 --> 30:29.460
{\an1}or you can stay
hung up in the past.

30:30.895 --> 30:32.163

30:37.936 --> 30:39.437

you only like me

30:39.504 --> 30:41.706

we're in a house,

30:41.773 --> 30:43.474
and we're stuck
in this house.

30:43.541 --> 30:45.510

influence come in,

30:45.577 --> 30:46.978
I'm gonna get hurt
like this again.

as an overlap.

that she can't get over it,

to do anything

{\an8}With six cuts
from ten singles,

39:53.958 --> 39:55.926
{\an8}you'll no longer be
an ex on the beach.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.795
{\an8}(Angela)
In a complete massacre,

39:57.862 --> 39:59.463
{\an8}Marcus is sent home
at elimination.

39:59.530 --> 40:02.967
{\an8}Take your coloring book
tattoos with you, goodbye.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.236
{\an8}Yup.

40:05.302 --> 40:07.605
But with that
being said,

40:07.671 --> 40:09.373
for the rest of you...

40:10.808 --> 40:12.843
Well, you made it
another week.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.246
{\an5}Everybody, y'all have
a good night.
Enjoy the night.

40:15.312 --> 40:18.282
{\an1}I'll be seeing some of y'all
at the beach real soon.

40:20.684 --> 40:23.354
{\an8}Marcus came in last night
just a little too hot.

40:23.420 --> 40:25.122
{\an8}He managed to piss
everybody off.

40:25.189 --> 40:27.424
It was embarrassing.
I felt irritated.

40:27.491 --> 40:29.059
What's done is done.

40:29.126 --> 40:31.028
I didn't think that many people
didn't like me.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.263
(Faith)
It did hurt my feelings that

40:32.329 --> 40:33.964
he was getting
so many cuts today,

40:34.031 --> 40:35.299
{\an8}because I wanted him
to be in the house

40:35.366 --> 40:36.734
{\an8}and I wanted to give him
a shot.

40:36.801 --> 40:38.169
{\an7}I can imagine
a couple of things

40:38.235 --> 40:40.070
{\an7}that I didn't
maybe do right.

40:40.137 --> 40:41.505
{\an7}(Faith)
Yeah, I agree.

40:44.074 --> 40:45.876
{\an8}(Marcus)
Haven't been here
on the island too long,

40:45.943 --> 40:48.145
{\an8}but it was wonderful
to meet everyone.

40:48.212 --> 40:50.047
{\an8}It's unfortunate
we got on the wrong foot

40:50.114 --> 40:52.049
{\an8}with each other.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.049
{\an8}Shut the (bleep) up!

40:52.116 --> 40:54.652
{\an8}Maybe it didn't work out
in the way I imagined it to.

40:54.718 --> 40:56.086
{\an8}Like, I'm sad that I didn't

40:56.153 --> 40:57.988
{\an8}get to reconnect with Faith, but
it's all good.

40:58.055 --> 40:59.890
{\an8}I'll still be
the person that I always am,

40:59.957 --> 41:01.458
{\an8}and I have absolutely
no regrets.

41:01.525 --> 41:04.195
{\an8}So, I'm just gonna continue
to put out my good vibes.

41:04.261 --> 41:07.398
{\an8}I came out of the sea,
back to the sea I go.

41:07.464 --> 41:09.233
{\an8}My time here was short.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.435
{\an8}I'm no longer
an ex on the beach.

41:11.502 --> 41:13.437
{\an8}♪♪

41:15.139 --> 41:19.176
{\an8}(announcer)
Next on
"Ex on the Beach"...

41:19.243 --> 41:21.812
Jasmine, you'll face a dilemma
of biblical proportions.

41:21.879 --> 41:23.848
Every Eve needs
her Adam.

41:23.914 --> 41:26.483
{\an5}(announcer)
Jasmine questions whether
to commit the original sin.

41:26.550 --> 41:28.385
Watching what the (bleep)
is going on...

41:29.520 --> 41:31.488
Alicia reaches
her boiling point.

41:31.555 --> 41:33.123
{\an5}(Alicia)
What are you gonna
(bleep) do?

41:33.190 --> 41:34.925
(announcer)
And whose ex is next?
