<i>-Ladies and gentlemen,
we have just</i>

00:03.828 --> 00:05.687
<i>reached our cruising altitude.</i>

00:05.749 --> 00:08.998
This is William Strong, your pilot
for this ride across the pond,

00:09.084 --> 00:11.436
My co-pilot is Daniel Prentice

00:11.616 --> 00:14.975
<i>We're looking at a total flight time
of just around seven and a half hours</i>

00:14.999 --> 00:17.342
<i>which should put us on the
ground in London, England</i>

00:17.538 --> 00:18.538
<i>right on time.</i>

00:18.562 --> 00:21.319
<i>Forecast calls for clear skies
so sit back</i>

00:21.343 --> 00:23.343
relax, enjoy your ride.

00:25.468 --> 00:28.842
You didn't get that haircut
we talked about after your vacation.

00:28.867 --> 00:31.347
- It's still within regulations.

00:31.372 --> 00:33.023
-Barely.

00:36.383 --> 00:37.916
-Sir, are you doing Ok?

00:38.718 --> 00:40.051
Here you go, sweetie

00:40.218 --> 00:41.218
-Thank you.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.663
-Can I get you anything?

00:43.202 --> 00:46.136
Another late night, party girl?
-Oh, shush.

01:18.331 --> 01:20.401
We'll all cross checks at dawn.

01:20.698 --> 01:22.425
Been in the air a while.

01:22.668 --> 01:23.668
How you doing?

01:23.692 --> 01:25.692
-I have still a few more
hours to get through.

01:28.267 --> 01:31.189
Hey wing-man, you're making
me nervous. Something up over there?

01:32.595 --> 01:33.595
-I don't know.

01:34.525 --> 01:35.790
-Maybe a short somewhere?

01:38.775 --> 01:39.775
-Ha. See?

01:40.119 --> 01:41.554
All you need is just a little...

01:42.276 --> 01:44.276
-Come on, Daniel, disengage the yoke.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.603
I got it figured out.

01:45.946 --> 01:48.478
Gander center, this is I-A 42

01:48.502 --> 01:50.498
We seem to be having some
bit of an instrument problem,

01:50.523 --> 01:51.838
we're trying to sort them out.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.845
I-A 42.
<i>-Understood, I-A 42.</i>

01:54.869 --> 01:57.462
<i>-You're looking at clear skies ahead
of you in all directions.</i>

01:57.486 --> 01:59.244
<i>Let us know if you need assistance.</i>

02:00.041 --> 02:01.174
-Will do, I-A 42.

02:02.955 --> 02:05.222
Daniel, I can't fly like this, man.

02:09.150 --> 02:10.150
Damn it.

02:20.783 --> 02:24.408
Gander center. This is IA-42.
I thought you said we had clear skies.

02:24.767 --> 02:27.767
<i>-You had clear skies five seconds
ago, IA-42.</i>

02:27.791 --> 02:29.954
<i>It pumped um on our screens out of nowhere.</i>

02:29.978 --> 02:31.978
<i>Squack 7700</i>

02:32.002 --> 02:34.892
<i>Do you have any way around this?
We're showing it right on top of you.</i>

02:34.916 --> 02:38.720
-Ladies and gentlemen please
return to your seats. We seem to be...

02:41.369 --> 02:44.218
<i>Crew! Secure the cabin
and return to your seats immediately.</i>

03:02.867 --> 03:03.867
-Shit!

03:15.514 --> 03:17.741
-Think we can fly around it?

03:18.030 --> 03:19.801
-I think we have to
go straight through.

03:31.095 --> 03:33.259
-The hatch is rolling.

04:31.147 --> 04:32.634
-Oh god.
-What happened?

04:32.659 --> 04:34.025
-Are you alright?

04:39.673 --> 04:41.274
-It's night already?

04:41.572 --> 04:44.905
Sunset wasn't for another
forty or fifty minutes.

04:50.511 --> 04:52.394
We didn't black out
or anything, did we?

04:53.566 --> 04:54.769
-Oh, nothing like that.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.237
<i>-Sorry about that, everyone.</i>

05:01.261 --> 05:03.261
<i>We had a sudden storm
pop up there.</i>

05:03.825 --> 05:05.739
<i>Good news we have
past the worst of it.</i>

05:05.887 --> 05:07.848
<i>It should be smooth sailing from hereon in.</i>

05:08.622 --> 05:11.004
<i>You'll notice that while we
were going through that storm,</i>

05:11.512 --> 05:12.519
<i>the sun went down</i>

05:12.544 --> 05:14.918
<i>That'll happen sometimes
when you cross the tip of the</i>

05:14.943 --> 05:16.943
<i>Bermuda triangle.</i>

05:17.763 --> 05:18.763
<i>Don't worry.</i>

05:18.787 --> 05:20.787
<i>You'll catch another sunset tomorrow.</i>

05:23.486 --> 05:25.686
-The tip of the Bermuda triangle?

05:25.727 --> 05:27.292
-It's as good Sn answer as any.

05:46.065 --> 05:47.994
-Anyone else's internet
connection down?

05:48.862 --> 05:51.329
-Yeah, my phone
signal's dead, too.

05:58.385 --> 05:59.985
-Jesus, you seeing this?

06:04.784 --> 06:05.956
Above altitude,

06:06.409 --> 06:07.409
airspeed fuel

06:08.783 --> 06:10.720
-But that's just enough
to keep us airborne.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.586
three-quarters of attack level, fine, but

06:14.255 --> 06:15.801
that's assuming we're still on course.

06:17.164 --> 06:19.117
-You've got control.
Disengaging.

06:20.776 --> 06:23.963
Gander center, this is IA-42,
we've gone through the storm.

06:23.987 --> 06:26.861
But it seems most of our
instruments are out. Require assistance.

06:27.604 --> 06:28.947
IA-42.

06:30.711 --> 06:32.898
Gander center this is
London bound

06:32.923 --> 06:34.562
IA-42. Do you read me?

06:40.585 --> 06:41.835
I don't know what's going on.

06:42.765 --> 06:44.077
-Check the backup system.

06:44.102 --> 06:47.047
There must be something
that's working. -On it.

06:47.071 --> 06:49.977
Gander center, this is IA-42,
do you copy?

06:52.837 --> 06:53.837
Still nothing.

06:54.305 --> 06:55.305
You?

06:55.531 --> 06:57.531
-We've got one thing
humming along just fine.

06:58.274 --> 06:59.515
-That...what is it?

07:01.032 --> 07:02.232
-Our radar system.

07:03.316 --> 07:05.503
Only thing on the plane
that wasn't replaced

07:05.528 --> 07:08.754
last time we upgraded international
airline avionics.

07:09.708 --> 07:11.309
As long as that's operational.

07:11.575 --> 07:13.192
That's a step in the right direction.

07:14.653 --> 07:16.059
-How you doing here?

07:16.083 --> 07:17.668
-Oh, good, thank you.

07:22.246 --> 07:23.246
-Thank you.

07:25.035 --> 07:28.902
-Can I get you something to drink?
-Sorry, were you standing there long?

07:29.020 --> 07:32.058
-No, that's fine. What can I get you?
-A ginger ale.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.054
It got dark early, didn't it?

07:37.078 --> 07:39.933
-I'm sure it's just  because of
the storm, like the captain said.

07:39.957 --> 07:42.340
-Thank you.
-So,what brings you gentlemen

07:42.365 --> 07:44.293
to England, business
or pleasure?

07:44.996 --> 07:45.996
-Both.

07:46.109 --> 07:48.075
-We're history professors.
ECU university.

07:48.192 --> 07:50.192
There’s convention just outside London.

07:50.466 --> 07:53.396
-They've discovered some amazing
pre war artifacts,

07:53.420 --> 07:55.216
and several distinguished members
of the...

07:55.241 --> 07:56.646
-You didn’t have to bore
 the poor woman.

07:56.671 --> 07:59.169
her eyes are glazing over already.
-No, that's fine.

07:59.193 --> 08:00.799
I just need to finish
this side of the plane,

08:00.824 --> 08:02.568
but I'd love to hear about
it so I'll come back.

08:03.084 --> 08:04.661
-I'm gonna hold you to that.

08:04.709 --> 08:06.747
-Get out now while you still can.

08:08.719 --> 08:11.796
Alright, about the Hitler
map of Argentina...

08:14.383 --> 08:16.343
-What are you working on there?

08:16.368 --> 08:20.074
-Who? me? just trying to
keep track of everything.

08:20.098 --> 08:22.726
You see, when you
get to my age,

08:22.750 --> 08:26.023
you have to stay on top
 of things, because uh...

08:26.594 --> 08:28.781
you never know when you
are going to get another chance.

08:29.974 --> 08:31.685
-Well, I'll let you get
back to it, then.

08:32.264 --> 08:33.397
-Thank you, then.

08:46.077 --> 08:47.858
-Huh, that's weird.

08:48.827 --> 08:50.499
-You got some <i>more</i>
good news for me?

08:50.523 --> 08:51.991
-Take a look.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.419
-There's nothing there.
-Not a blip.

08:58.475 --> 09:00.735
-Is the radar malfunctioned too?

09:00.829 --> 09:02.429
- I thought so at first,

09:02.454 --> 09:04.702
 but the coordinates are moving with us.

09:04.997 --> 09:07.497
If this thing were in the fritz,
it wouldn't be working at all.

09:08.872 --> 09:11.036
-So we're flying deaf
but not completely blind?

09:11.060 --> 09:14.364
-There should be some air traffic
showing up around us.

09:15.239 --> 09:16.559
-Ok, so let's make a loop.

09:16.583 --> 09:18.044
Try to find someone or something.

09:30.637 --> 09:31.637
-Nothing.

09:31.661 --> 09:32.761
Butkus

09:33.199 --> 09:35.144
According to the radar,
we're all alone up here.

09:36.585 --> 09:39.061
-Maybe the storm diverted traffic.

09:39.367 --> 09:41.007
We'll wait until the radios
come back up.

09:41.031 --> 09:42.444
-What if it doesn't?

09:42.921 --> 09:44.819
We're still a couple
of hours away from London.

09:45.429 --> 09:47.679
That's assuming we
didn't get turned around.

09:47.703 --> 09:49.218
Or blown off course.

09:51.492 --> 09:53.718
If we duck under the cloud cover,

09:54.046 --> 09:55.960
we may be able to find some

09:56.242 --> 09:58.593
visual cue from a
shipping lane or maybe

09:58.786 --> 10:01.176
a message being relayed
 from a cargo ship.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.950
-You sure that's the right move?

10:02.974 --> 10:04.974
-If no one can hear
 us on the ground,

10:06.419 --> 10:07.989
that's the only move you've got.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.123
-This is Cameron.

10:15.497 --> 10:17.059
-Hey, Hicks. How's it
going back there?

10:17.513 --> 10:19.426
-We're all a little rattled but we're fine.

10:19.974 --> 10:20.974
-Good.

10:21.411 --> 10:22.747
I want to make an announcement

10:22.864 --> 10:25.872
and I want the crew back
in their seats when we're making a descent.

10:26.130 --> 10:27.330
-Is everything Ok?

10:27.372 --> 10:29.614
-Just trying to get away
from some of this ...uh...

10:30.106 --> 10:31.640
high-level wind shield.

10:32.693 --> 10:34.177
Just get everyone
strapped in, Ok?

10:34.795 --> 10:35.795
-Sure.

10:40.053 --> 10:41.053
-Everything Ok?

10:41.858 --> 10:43.506
-We need to get everyone to their seats.

10:43.529 --> 10:44.857
We're making a descent.

10:45.131 --> 10:48.264
He says it's to get away
from the turbulence.

10:48.897 --> 10:50.248
-<i>What</i> turbulence?

10:51.334 --> 10:52.646
-Ladies and gentlemen,

10:52.670 --> 10:54.779
we'd like everyone to
get back in their seats,

10:54.803 --> 10:56.803
We're trying to get away
from this turbulence so we'll

10:56.827 --> 10:58.998
be ducking under the clouds for a bit.

10:59.022 --> 11:00.466
Pretty routine stuff.

11:00.490 --> 11:03.224
But we'd like everyone
buckled in just in case.

11:11.274 --> 11:12.969
-All secure back here, captain.

11:24.987 --> 11:26.128
-You Ok?

11:26.691 --> 11:27.757
-Yeah, I'm fine.

11:28.027 --> 11:29.027
-Trust me.

11:29.051 --> 11:31.917
When you've been doing this
as long as I have, you've seen it all.

11:32.323 --> 11:33.390
This is nothing.

11:33.573 --> 11:34.573
-Alright. Ok.

11:40.066 --> 11:41.066
-Land?

11:42.112 --> 11:43.924
The Atlantic should be below us.

11:44.336 --> 11:45.438
-So it should be.

11:52.180 --> 11:53.180
-Ok.

11:53.383 --> 11:55.183
So we got blown off course.

11:55.207 --> 11:56.982
Gander center, do you copy?

11:58.239 --> 12:00.410
-Keep your eyes open
for a radio tower.

12:00.435 --> 12:02.646
Blinking lights, anything.

12:07.936 --> 12:11.115
Radar says we got small
aircraft about twenty kilometers away.

12:12.943 --> 12:14.743
But they're all bunched up.

12:15.342 --> 12:17.342
-Are you sure that's aircraft?

12:17.366 --> 12:19.935
Never seen anything like that before.
-I'm not sure of anything,

12:19.960 --> 12:21.975
but we're closing in on
whatever the hell this is.

12:25.217 --> 12:26.561
-It's too hazy up ahead.

12:26.624 --> 12:27.865
Could be another storm.

12:29.108 --> 12:30.442
-That's not a storm.

12:31.405 --> 12:32.739
Looks more like a...

12:33.569 --> 12:34.569
fire!

12:44.229 --> 12:45.229
-Oh, my God!

12:45.253 --> 12:46.595
-Have you seen that?

12:48.846 --> 12:49.846
-Oh my God!

12:56.770 --> 12:58.606
Jesus...Christ.

13:16.324 --> 13:17.524
-What's happening?

13:20.152 --> 13:21.152
-Oh my God!

13:22.511 --> 13:23.777
-What is happening?

13:31.034 --> 13:32.034
-Well?

13:32.386 --> 13:35.120
-We've got something close
coming in hot 09

13:41.047 --> 13:42.734
Cut the NAV lights

13:43.586 --> 13:45.156
Shit! You're sitting duck out here.

13:45.180 --> 13:46.562
Hang on!

13:50.203 --> 13:51.337
Watch that radar!

14:04.097 --> 14:06.299
-Hey, What...what's going on?

14:06.323 --> 14:08.576
-What's happening is we're
going to get shot down

14:08.601 --> 14:10.628
just like those other
planes in the Ukraine.

14:10.652 --> 14:12.464
-We deserve to know what's happening.

14:12.489 --> 14:15.362
-As soon as the captain
has everything under control. I'm sure that

14:15.387 --> 14:16.416
He'll inform us as to exactly...

14:16.441 --> 14:18.527
-Hey, I just want...I'm trying
to get some answers, Ok?

14:18.707 --> 14:22.061
-As soon as <i>we</i> know what's going
on, sir, we'll let <i>you</i> know.

14:22.085 --> 14:23.576
-What? No!

14:24.374 --> 14:26.752
No! We want answers.

14:30.302 --> 14:31.793
-Sir, let...go of me.

14:32.770 --> 14:33.770
-Sir.

14:34.122 --> 14:36.293
If you don't sit down, we
will have to restrain you.

14:36.645 --> 14:38.189
Now, sit down!

14:39.239 --> 14:40.239
-Fine.

14:52.148 --> 14:53.148
-Strong.

14:53.172 --> 14:54.593
<i>-Will, what's going on?</i>

14:54.617 --> 14:56.593
<i>-We're trying to get a handle of this.</i>

14:56.742 --> 14:58.475
<i>Is everyone Ok back there?</i>

14:58.656 --> 14:59.922
-Everyone's fine...

15:00.663 --> 15:02.343
just confused <i>and concerned.</i>

15:02.687 --> 15:04.218
-Let me address the plane.

15:04.242 --> 15:07.389
We'll let you know as soon as
we can. Just keep everybody calm, Ok?

15:24.505 --> 15:26.105
-Looks like we're clear.

15:26.419 --> 15:27.952
Nothing anywhere close.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.723
-I'm gonna keep putting some
distance between us and them.

15:30.935 --> 15:33.528
In a few minutes we'll
try to duck below again, Ok?

15:34.397 --> 15:35.397
-What?

15:36.600 --> 15:38.623
Will, that didn't work
out so great last time!

15:38.784 --> 15:40.162
-We also don't know
where we are.

15:40.186 --> 15:42.550
Without instruments, all
we got are the landmarks

15:42.575 --> 15:44.749
and we can't find them
from above the clouds.

15:51.559 --> 15:52.892
Ladies and gentlemen

15:52.917 --> 15:55.606
Our party is without scare.
We've got blown off course

15:55.631 --> 15:57.631
it might have been because
of that storm,

15:57.655 --> 15:59.655
but appear to be out of danger.

16:00.092 --> 16:03.459
We ask all of you to
please bear with us and stay calm,

16:03.483 --> 16:05.483
the flight crew's here to help.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.897
-Excuse me. Sorry.
-No, no problem.

16:09.974 --> 16:11.053
How can I help you?

16:11.078 --> 16:13.078
-We were actually hoping
 we could help <i>you</i>.

16:13.791 --> 16:17.374
-Sorry, gentlemen. I don't have
time right now, it'll have to wait.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.769
-Captain, it's Cameron.

16:34.136 --> 16:35.815
-This isn't the best time to talk.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.241
-Captain, my name is Bennett
and this is my colleague Dale.

16:38.266 --> 16:40.353
-You can't be in the cockpit.
Hicks, get them out of here.

16:40.378 --> 16:41.494
Roger room, We need some help!

16:41.519 --> 16:44.096
Do you know what kind of
aircraft that was back there?

16:44.120 --> 16:47.666
-I want you guys back in your seats.
-They were Junkers, JU-88s

16:47.691 --> 16:50.901
A couple of Hinklers H111, sir!!!
-I made it very clear.

16:50.926 --> 16:54.323
-No one's made crop planes
like that since 1945!

16:54.347 --> 16:55.707
-You have to listen to us!

16:55.732 --> 16:58.346
There's no way those planes
can still be flying.

17:01.260 --> 17:03.587
-You seem to be flying
 without your instruments, captain.

17:04.446 --> 17:05.829
-Are you doing all this?

17:05.854 --> 17:07.854
-No, no of course not.
We can see they're down.

17:07.878 --> 17:09.878
-We are flying without most of them.

17:09.902 --> 17:11.902
-Everything that talk
through is satellite.

17:11.925 --> 17:13.925
The radar is the only thing that's working.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.685
Complete signal loss.

17:15.709 --> 17:17.982
Almost as if there <i>are</i> no satellites.

17:23.944 --> 17:25.611
-You have thirty seconds.

17:26.351 --> 17:27.905
-Is your radio working?

17:28.820 --> 17:30.210
-I'm getting some static but...

17:30.234 --> 17:33.007
-You haven't been able to contact
anyone since you passed through.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.507
-Something like that.

17:36.532 --> 17:40.233
-That's because there weren't many
allied radio towers on the western front...

17:41.320 --> 17:42.532
...in 1940.

18:01.844 --> 18:02.844
-Hey...

18:03.539 --> 18:04.539
Take it easy.

18:06.469 --> 18:07.469
Try to sleep.

18:08.180 --> 18:10.148
- I can't sleep now.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.867
-Me neither.

18:18.852 --> 18:19.852
That's odd.

18:20.625 --> 18:22.225
-Based on the coastline,

18:22.305 --> 18:24.431
the planes, we believe
we just flew through

18:24.456 --> 18:25.711
the bombing of St. Azair.

18:26.039 --> 18:29.273
-June 1940 massive German
bombing on the west coast of France.

18:31.524 --> 18:34.406
-I don't have time for this.
Get this conspiracy theorist back on his seat.

18:34.430 --> 18:36.804
-Wait. We can help you
 figure out where we are.

18:36.829 --> 18:40.195
If you dip back where all the
clouds get, we do know a little bit about the geography of World War II

18:40.220 --> 18:42.898
-Ok...Ok...you guys can help out.

18:43.736 --> 18:45.899
But get back to your seats now.

18:46.855 --> 18:48.128
-Of course, Captain.

18:48.153 --> 18:49.636
-And at a lower altitude.

18:49.659 --> 18:51.924
You'll be better off
picking up weaker frequencies...

18:51.949 --> 18:54.714
-I don't want to hear anything
about time travel, Ok?

18:54.860 --> 18:56.821
Let's just figure out
where we are first.

18:56.846 --> 18:59.442
-Even though it looks outdated,
that radar is more advanced

18:59.467 --> 19:01.648
than anything the Germans
are using at this point.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.392
-Enough...

19:04.104 --> 19:05.904
Now get back to your seats.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.927
-The point is, that radar
will keep you one step ahead

19:07.975 --> 19:09.920
if we come across another
one of those again.

19:09.945 --> 19:10.977
-Even if you were right,

19:11.002 --> 19:14.401
which is a massive, massive if,

19:14.917 --> 19:16.838
How do you propose we get back, huh?

19:17.815 --> 19:19.440
-We look for another weather anomaly.

19:20.639 --> 19:22.490
If one of these things brought us here,

19:23.037 --> 19:24.427
another one should be
 able to bring us back.

19:24.709 --> 19:26.123
-So we look for another storm?

19:28.537 --> 19:29.537
-Yeah.

19:30.897 --> 19:32.895
-Can you get our new friends
back to their seats, please? -

19:32.919 --> 19:34.506
Yeah, right now. Gentlemen.
-And hey...

19:35.100 --> 19:36.100
All of you...

19:37.311 --> 19:38.311
not a word.

19:38.889 --> 19:39.889
To anyone.

19:40.787 --> 19:41.787
Ok?

19:42.764 --> 19:44.480
-Ok.
-Gentlemen.

19:48.545 --> 19:50.974
-We're having electrical issues.

19:52.928 --> 19:53.928
-What about the planes?

19:54.303 --> 19:55.490
And the bombs?

19:59.275 --> 20:01.875
-I just don't want anyone to panic, Ok?

20:03.463 --> 20:04.729
-Can you handle it?

20:12.394 --> 20:13.394
-Captain?

20:14.401 --> 20:16.001
-We'll get through this.

20:16.025 --> 20:19.588
I've flown with you a million times,
you've never let me down once!

20:29.346 --> 20:31.433
-We will be making another
controlled descent

20:31.458 --> 20:33.135
but there is nothing
to worry about.

20:33.313 --> 20:35.836
Thank you for your
cooperation and patience.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.696
<i>-I don't see how you</i>
 can make that plan work.

20:37.721 --> 20:39.486
-It makes sense, look, it's logical...

20:39.511 --> 20:41.256
And when exactly do you think
physics agrees to that?

20:41.281 --> 20:41.837
Shut up.

20:41.861 --> 20:43.743
I'm telling you it's gonna work.

20:43.768 --> 20:45.079
-You can't <i>know</i> that.

20:45.103 --> 20:46.165
- (sighs) Ok.

20:46.189 --> 20:48.280
-Can I help you sir?

20:48.303 --> 20:49.779
-What'd the captain say?

20:49.804 --> 20:51.804
-You heard him. We're moving to
a lower altitude,

20:51.828 --> 20:53.828
to access the situation.

20:56.531 --> 20:57.531
-Ok...

20:57.781 --> 20:59.181
But what's going on?

21:00.132 --> 21:01.532
-I assure you ,sir...

21:01.556 --> 21:04.936
you'll know when everyone else does.
Now please let go of my arm.

21:06.890 --> 21:07.890
Thank you.

21:08.365 --> 21:09.432
I promise you...

21:09.670 --> 21:11.137
if you touch me again,

21:11.161 --> 21:14.201
You're going to have an entirely
different set of problems for you to deal with.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.561
-Ok, if we can pick out
any landmarks at all...

21:22.584 --> 21:23.974
-It's gonna be tricky.

21:23.999 --> 21:26.396
Without the twenty-first
century pollution, there's...

21:26.420 --> 21:29.771
you're...you're certain that
that was Saint Azaire?

21:30.590 --> 21:34.261
-It was the only coastline bombing
of that scope in 1940.

21:36.191 --> 21:38.121
-Alight. Alright.

21:38.145 --> 21:40.145
Get me some pencils.

21:40.169 --> 21:42.019
A scheduler.
-Ok.

21:55.812 --> 21:57.256
-Let's keep an eye out for storms.

21:59.671 --> 22:00.804
-Don't you start.

22:01.944 --> 22:04.397
-Time travel storm chasing,
this is insane.

22:04.421 --> 22:06.421
-I know. None of this
makes any sense.

22:06.445 --> 22:08.445
It will start to make sense
once we know where we are,

22:08.469 --> 22:10.469
so let's focus on <i>that</i> for now, Ok?

22:36.678 --> 22:37.678
Mayday.

22:38.827 --> 22:41.061
This is IA flight 42 out of Dallas.

22:41.725 --> 22:43.209
Open transition to anyone.

22:43.944 --> 22:47.139
We were end route to Heathrow
and got blown off course. Looking for assistance.

22:48.936 --> 22:49.936
Repeat

22:50.913 --> 22:52.733
This is IA flight 42

22:52.913 --> 22:55.139
Mayday. Is anyone out there? Over.

23:05.561 --> 23:07.467
-We're clear for miles
 according to the radar.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.193
Let's try to figure out
where the hell we are.

23:23.927 --> 23:25.061
-Hey, over there.

23:25.810 --> 23:26.877
Is that a river?

23:28.537 --> 23:29.630
-Eh...maybe?

23:29.826 --> 23:31.239
Sketch it anyway.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.966
This is unbelievable, I mean...

23:37.935 --> 23:40.602
right now, below us, the
invasion is in

23:41.341 --> 23:42.341
full swing.

23:45.615 --> 23:46.997
-If this really <i>is</i> June

23:47.294 --> 23:49.833
Hitler is about halfway
through the tour of his forces.

23:50.318 --> 23:51.661
Another week from now,

23:51.686 --> 23:53.083
it'll be Paris.

24:05.463 --> 24:07.263
-Shouldn't there be lights?

24:07.287 --> 24:08.407
Cities?

24:08.931 --> 24:10.931
-Probably just a power outage.

24:11.736 --> 24:13.751
It'll explain why we can't hear anyone.

24:16.767 --> 24:17.767
Repeat.

24:18.447 --> 24:20.493
This is flight 42. If
anyone can hear me,

24:21.080 --> 24:22.130
please acknowledge.

24:22.155 --> 24:25.116
<i>-indistinctly speaking French</i>

24:26.657 --> 24:27.694
French, I think.

24:27.749 --> 24:30.141
Maybe those guys are right.
Maybe we <i>are</i> in France.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.487
Wait, wait wait
wait wait, wait.

24:34.689 --> 24:35.689
is that German?

24:36.806 --> 24:37.806
-Repeat

24:38.791 --> 24:39.791
Over.

24:40.619 --> 24:41.619
-Hello!

24:42.002 --> 24:43.845
This is captain William Strong.

24:44.385 --> 24:46.712
IA flight 42.
Do you copy?

24:47.494 --> 24:50.986
<i>-Fly over international airspace,
please identify yourself.</i>

24:51.236 --> 24:56.072
-This is captain William Strong
requesting assistance. Do you copy?

24:56.377 --> 24:57.377
<i>-Captain?</i>

24:57.595 --> 24:58.595
<i>Listen,</i>

24:58.619 --> 25:00.712
<i>Whoever this is, this
 is a localized channel.</i>

25:00.737 --> 25:02.470
<i>to be used in emergencies only. Over.</i>

25:02.495 --> 25:04.932
-This is flight 42 out of Dallas.

25:04.956 --> 25:08.119
We've been flying blind.
We think we just saw some...

25:08.142 --> 25:09.720
German bombers.

25:09.745 --> 25:13.525
<i>-Bombers? Are you claiming
to be aboard an aircraft?</i>

25:13.549 --> 25:15.127
-Yes!

25:17.956 --> 25:18.956
Hello?

25:19.792 --> 25:22.604
<i>-My name is Corporal Nigel Shetfield.</i>

25:23.198 --> 25:27.682
<i>My position is classified, but it my duty
to intercept long range transmissions.</i>

25:27.706 --> 25:30.651
<i>And it is simply not possible
for you to be aboard an aircraft.</i>

25:30.674 --> 25:33.642
-Look, I don't have time to mess around.

25:33.667 --> 25:36.182
Can you just get us in touch
with civilian air traffic control?

25:36.206 --> 25:38.206
We need to land ASAP.

25:38.454 --> 25:40.971
<i>-Air traffic control? This is a war zone.</i>

25:41.204 --> 25:42.996
Anyone who can help us.

25:43.352 --> 25:44.611
Anyone.

25:44.636 --> 25:45.705
<i>Alright, captain.</i>

25:46.464 --> 25:49.064
<i>What branch of the
 military are you in?</i>

25:49.088 --> 25:51.966
-We are...a commercial airline.

25:51.990 --> 25:53.286
International.

25:53.310 --> 25:55.982
-<i>And you've flown through
German bombing run?</i>

25:56.123 --> 25:57.661
<i>No, it's absurd.</i>

25:58.029 --> 25:59.029
-Look...

25:59.333 --> 26:02.669
Can you just help us get our
bearing?  What is your GMT?

26:03.669 --> 26:04.669
-<i>Fine, captain.</i>

26:05.591 --> 26:08.341
<i>17th June, 2130 hours.</i>

26:08.607 --> 26:09.607
-And the year?

26:10.318 --> 26:11.895
-<i>Uh, are you joking?</i>

26:12.724 --> 26:15.134
-Let's all get on the same
page, Nigel, Ok?

26:15.159 --> 26:17.495
-<i>17th June 1940</i>

26:20.423 --> 26:23.282
<i>Do they not stock calendars
in international airlines?</i>

26:23.782 --> 26:25.805
<i>If this charade is quite finished,</i>

26:25.830 --> 26:28.079
<i>I'd highly recommend you
get off this channel and...</i>

26:28.103 --> 26:29.345
-Listen!

26:29.821 --> 26:31.242
I don't know if you're
part of some

26:31.267 --> 26:33.595
sick hoax, but we
are in distress

26:33.634 --> 26:36.392
You're the only person
we've been able to reach.

26:36.417 --> 26:38.736
-<i>Hoax? We're certainly not.</i>

26:38.759 --> 26:41.360
<i>Now, kindly remove yourself
 from this frequency and...</i>

26:41.384 --> 26:44.767
-How do I convince you that
we're a commercial airline in distress?

26:45.290 --> 26:46.993
-<i>Sure I don't know captain.</i>

27:00.705 --> 27:01.705
-Ok...

27:03.971 --> 27:04.971
Here?

27:04.995 --> 27:06.033
-Here?

27:07.424 --> 27:08.424
-It has to be.

27:08.557 --> 27:09.557
So if...

27:09.581 --> 27:11.080
If that's red, then...then...

27:11.424 --> 27:12.424
that means that

27:13.400 --> 27:16.400
-Oh, we've got to tell the captain.
Come on.

27:39.442 --> 27:40.442
<i>-Look...</i>

27:40.466 --> 27:43.567
even if this is a hoax, Nigel,
or whoever you are,

27:43.591 --> 27:47.012
all we've got is our fuel
gauge, altitude,

27:47.036 --> 27:49.036
and radar that's working at the moment.

27:50.942 --> 27:52.316
-Your radar?

27:53.536 --> 27:55.336
<i>-You know?</i> 
Radar detection?

27:55.778 --> 27:58.965
Scans the skies, lets you know
where other air crafts and objects are?

27:59.129 --> 28:01.129
-Well that certainly sounds familiar

28:01.153 --> 28:03.402
to the IDF technology we Brits
are developing, but

28:03.631 --> 28:05.988
but I have nothing like
that at my disposal.

28:06.129 --> 28:09.350
-Well, that's the only thing that's keeping
us up in the air at the moment.

28:12.693 --> 28:14.544
-Captain, we think we know where we are.

28:16.506 --> 28:18.707
Nigel, I have just been
 joined by a couple of

28:19.055 --> 28:20.607
history professors. They think

28:20.632 --> 28:22.622
they know where we are.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.069
-I beg your pardon?

28:24.353 --> 28:26.684
<i>-We were able</i> to pick out
a very identifiable

28:26.709 --> 28:28.419
river and surrounding hills.

28:28.444 --> 28:30.592
-We've just passed over
Rhen

28:30.616 --> 28:32.616
in the northwest of France based on

28:32.640 --> 28:35.318
the timing since the last
bombing, it's our best guest.

28:35.342 --> 28:37.874
<i>Uh, we...we're relatively</i> certain that

28:37.898 --> 28:39.501
we flew through the bombing of

28:39.526 --> 28:43.074
St Nazaire where the RMS
Lancastria was attacked and sunk

28:43.366 --> 28:44.632
-Sunk?

28:45.695 --> 28:46.695
The Lancastria?

28:47.453 --> 28:49.530
<i>Even if that were true,
how can you possibly...</i>

28:49.670 --> 28:51.874
-You're...you're going to
find this hard to believe, but

28:51.899 --> 28:54.710
<i>we were en route from DC
to...to  London</i>

28:55.023 --> 28:56.823
in the twenty-first century

28:56.855 --> 28:58.855
and we flew through a storm or

28:58.879 --> 29:00.879
<i>something and now we're here.</i>

29:02.359 --> 29:04.374
<i>-This is hard...</i>
-Look, forget about that

29:04.968 --> 29:06.368
<i>This is what we know.</i>

29:06.781 --> 29:08.663
We're up here all alone,

29:09.390 --> 29:10.924
and we're in a war zone.

29:12.312 --> 29:14.544
<i>Nigel can come by without your help.</i>

29:17.561 --> 29:19.834
-What...what if we were
able to tell you

29:19.859 --> 29:22.171
about the bombing of saint Nazaire?

29:22.359 --> 29:23.959
<i>-What could you tell me?</i>

29:24.101 --> 29:25.234
-The air forces...

29:25.671 --> 29:27.179
Junker ju 88s,

29:27.343 --> 29:28.788
<i>Heinkel he 111s</i>

29:29.078 --> 29:30.780
Messerschmidt Bf 110s

29:31.000 --> 29:32.200
likely prototypes.

29:32.789 --> 29:34.055
And the Lancastria.

29:36.070 --> 29:37.390
<i>Radio the front.</i>

29:38.585 --> 29:41.061
You'll be able to confirm
she was lost.

29:41.398 --> 29:43.358
-<i>Yes, well, I'll do just that.</i>

29:43.914 --> 29:45.702
<i>If</i> you're serious,

29:46.352 --> 29:48.351
go back on this frequency
in thirty minutes.

29:50.282 --> 29:51.914
-Recap in thirty minutes.

29:52.414 --> 29:53.992
Call us back in five.

29:56.407 --> 29:57.828
-I'll do what I can.

30:00.140 --> 30:01.359
God help me.

30:07.892 --> 30:08.892
-Show me the route.

30:08.916 --> 30:10.916
The two points you've figured out.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.512
-Think we can come in the course?

30:18.599 --> 30:19.599
-Hopefully

30:19.623 --> 30:21.623
Then we can figure out our range.

30:23.255 --> 30:24.669
Just under half a tank right now.

30:42.377 --> 30:43.377
-Uh, Shetfield.

30:43.530 --> 30:45.030
-Coronal, moment.

30:45.054 --> 30:46.303
-Any news?

30:46.327 --> 30:47.897
-One transmission, sir.

30:47.921 --> 30:49.921
You're going to want
to hear about it.

31:34.238 --> 31:35.704
-Ladies and gentlemen.

31:36.199 --> 31:37.666
I...I have information

31:37.689 --> 31:40.386
that this flight crew has
 neglected to give us.

31:40.410 --> 31:43.026
-Sir, I'm going to need you...
-Get your hands of me.

31:43.854 --> 31:45.854
And I know how this is gonna sound.

31:45.878 --> 31:47.878
But I believe that somehow

31:48.854 --> 31:50.921
we have traveled through time.

31:56.785 --> 31:58.785
-How many drinks have you had?

32:01.480 --> 32:02.964
-We all saw that storm.

32:02.988 --> 32:05.393
And...and the planes and the bombs...

32:06.698 --> 32:07.698
<i>She</i> knows.

32:09.706 --> 32:13.073
Somehow, we've time traveled
back to the middle of World War II.

32:13.245 --> 32:14.900
-Everyone please stay calm.
There's not-

32:14.925 --> 32:18.893
-No! no one is telling us anything.
We have a right to know.

32:18.917 --> 32:20.917
-Sit down, you're scaring everyone.

32:25.612 --> 32:28.299
-You...you might not believe
that we've traveled through time,

32:28.323 --> 32:30.323
but we're  clearly in a war zone.

32:30.799 --> 32:32.010
-So what?

32:32.831 --> 32:33.831
-So??

32:34.393 --> 32:36.025
We're not gonna survive.

32:36.510 --> 32:38.353
This jet wasn't built for war.

32:40.456 --> 32:42.065
But...listen...listen...

32:42.088 --> 32:44.088
Do you know what this means?

32:44.666 --> 32:45.666
Right now

32:46.401 --> 32:49.401
as we speak, we...
we're flying over France.

32:49.425 --> 32:51.252
In June of 1940.

32:51.276 --> 32:54.377
On the ground, Hitler
has joined his forces and

32:54.401 --> 32:56.401
we...all of us, all of us...

32:57.362 --> 32:59.369
we have one opportunity

32:59.588 --> 33:01.393
to change human history.

33:02.385 --> 33:03.760
We can kill Hitler.

33:07.409 --> 33:11.228
-Ok, and...um...how
do you propose we do that?

33:11.252 --> 33:16.049
They tried to assassinate Hitler
 during the war and failed.

33:16.993 --> 33:19.391
-Ok, during the war,
they were operating on

33:19.416 --> 33:24.657
outdated intelligence. We...we know
exactly where Hitler will be. It's all here in this book.

33:25.016 --> 33:27.829
Everything step-by-step
detailed information exactly

33:27.853 --> 33:31.314
where Hitler and the SS went.
-Ok, they will see us coming

33:31.338 --> 33:34.189
from miles away. it's suicide.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.213
it wouldn't work.

33:39.606 --> 33:42.073
-We're...we're surrounded by bombers.

33:42.097 --> 33:43.645
and...and attack planes.

33:44.106 --> 33:46.160
We're...we're probably not gonna survive.

33:47.254 --> 33:50.020
But we can land this plane
we can find Hitler and

33:50.044 --> 33:52.199
we can kill him.
-Ok, that's enough!

33:53.442 --> 33:55.012
-Whoa, whoa...
-Let him go.

33:55.348 --> 33:56.958
-Oh God.
-He's right.

33:57.223 --> 33:59.223
-We need to take matter
into our own hands.

33:59.247 --> 34:01.207
We cam prevent the Holocaust.

34:01.232 --> 34:03.668
-We would just need to
find a safe place to land.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.996
And convince the pilots.

34:06.152 --> 34:07.730
-Gentlemen!
-Stop, stop, stop...

34:09.645 --> 34:10.762
-Stand down.

34:13.154 --> 34:15.896
-I would think that you
would be on our side, Sargent.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.996
We can win this war.

34:18.021 --> 34:20.402
-Or you could be making t
he whole thing up.

34:20.427 --> 34:23.121
But what I <i>do</i> know is you're
trying to hijack this plane.

34:23.146 --> 34:25.146
And that's an act of terrorism.

34:25.170 --> 34:27.170
-I'm a patriot.

34:29.310 --> 34:31.364
-Listen, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

34:31.389 --> 34:33.071
But there is no way me
and Private Jackson

34:33.096 --> 34:35.159
here are letting you take that cockpit.

34:38.587 --> 34:40.387
-You think you can stop us?

34:41.377 --> 34:43.033
-I don't think you want to find out

34:46.728 --> 34:49.395
-We could use you in this plan, Sargent.

34:49.418 --> 34:50.955
You could be heroes.

34:52.268 --> 34:54.601
-I'd prefer not to fight over this.

35:16.647 --> 35:18.068
-Get off of me!

35:22.447 --> 35:23.447
You...

35:29.205 --> 35:30.205
-What was that?

35:33.845 --> 35:35.517
-Whoa, you're not thinking this through.

35:35.541 --> 35:37.541
-No sir, <i>you're</i> not thinking this through.

35:37.877 --> 35:39.077
Suppose we try it.

35:39.401 --> 35:40.634
It's easy to make a mistake.

35:40.659 --> 35:42.931
Even when you think you
know <i>exactly</i> where the enemy is.

35:43.635 --> 35:44.635
Trust me.

35:46.221 --> 35:48.549
Say it really <i>is</i> World
War II down there,

35:48.573 --> 35:51.095
and we make one slip up,
just <i>one</i>,

35:51.361 --> 35:53.119
The axis will have this plane,

35:53.291 --> 35:54.291
the technology,

35:54.315 --> 35:57.306
and that book, which will
tell Hitler <i>everything</i>.

35:58.248 --> 36:00.545
There will be a Nazi
flag flying all over the White House

36:00.569 --> 36:02.569
all because <i>you</i> wanted to be a hero.

36:05.014 --> 36:07.170
But maybe we <i>can</i> change the past,

36:07.803 --> 36:09.603
but we can also screw it up.

36:10.733 --> 36:11.733
Forever.

36:12.795 --> 36:15.076
Now get back to your
seat. Shut the hell up.

36:36.005 --> 36:37.802
-Yeah?
-Everyone Ok back there?

36:39.091 --> 36:40.763
-Yes. Nothing we couldn't handle.

36:48.054 --> 36:49.624
-We can always tie them up, then.

36:50.234 --> 36:51.701
Taking fights at them.

36:51.780 --> 36:52.780
Isn't it right?

36:53.351 --> 36:54.684
-Yeah, Ah, yes, sir.

36:56.890 --> 36:58.695
-We'll keep him out of your way, ma'am.

36:59.710 --> 37:01.140
-Thank you.

37:01.195 --> 37:02.585
-Thanks yourself.

37:02.890 --> 37:04.945
That's why we make fire extinguisher.

37:19.924 --> 37:23.861
-At our current speed, we've
got about 150 minutes in the air, tops.

37:23.885 --> 37:26.220
That's not counting climbing
or descending, either.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.791
-At least we know where we're headed.

37:29.112 --> 37:33.853
We <i>do</i> know where we're headed, right?
-We should be just about middle of France.

37:34.588 --> 37:37.220
-So if we maintain our course,
we should be able to

37:37.244 --> 37:42.213
find some friendlies or a safe
landing place soon, right?

37:44.479 --> 37:45.479
What happened?

37:45.503 --> 37:47.748
-Some idiots on board
tried to hijack the plane

37:47.773 --> 37:49.362
because they want
to kill Hitler.

37:49.846 --> 37:51.806
Some soldiers on board tried
to peace the situation,

37:51.831 --> 37:54.033
but passengers are
gonna need answers.

37:54.079 --> 37:55.656
And soon.

37:56.540 --> 37:59.517
-<i>Corporal Nigel Shetfield
calling Captain William Strong.</i>

37:59.760 --> 38:01.970
-This is Captain Strong.
Go ahead, Nigel.

38:02.314 --> 38:03.781
-So you're still here.

38:03.805 --> 38:07.470
<i>-I'm afraid you're stuck with us.
And that was more like ten minutes, Nigel.</i>

38:07.494 --> 38:10.736
-Yes, some things take time, captain.

38:11.319 --> 38:13.373
<i>I've talked things over with command</i>

38:13.397 --> 38:15.881
<i>it's one of the boys in
the Western front and</i>

38:16.287 --> 38:19.030
<i>while we're inclined to believe you,</i>

38:19.397 --> 38:22.881
<i>talking about the time
 travel you understand.</i>

38:24.483 --> 38:27.116
Your Intel about the
Lancaster <i>seems</i> to be accurate.

38:28.194 --> 38:30.014
<i>And the truth is...</i>

38:30.983 --> 38:32.741
<i>This helped us out a lot.</i>

38:33.288 --> 38:36.741
I mean, no one on the ground
was able to ascertain the extent of the fire power,

38:38.647 --> 38:41.412
<i>And you guys would certainly
not give out that kind of information.</i>

38:41.632 --> 38:44.077
-On that, we are on the same
page about <i>something</i>, Nigel.

38:46.672 --> 38:47.672
-Yes, well...

38:48.296 --> 38:50.624
we could do with any
bit of good Intel we can now.

38:52.305 --> 38:53.305
After duck!

38:55.399 --> 38:56.532
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

38:57.930 --> 38:59.461
it's just such a bloody runt.

39:01.991 --> 39:02.991
-A runt?

39:03.632 --> 39:04.632
No, no...

39:05.069 --> 39:08.076
Allied forces evacuated
hundreds of thousands of troops.

39:08.405 --> 39:09.405
-Evacuated?

39:10.374 --> 39:11.990
<i>Maybe you all seen a newspaper?</i>

39:12.397 --> 39:15.287
The Germans closed us
from both sides. it was a bloody slaughter.

39:16.881 --> 39:19.265
<i>Nearly half a million was killed.</i>

39:20.053 --> 39:21.053
<i>Cut down.</i>

39:22.444 --> 39:23.444
-What is it?

39:24.452 --> 39:26.436
-He said that Dunkirk was
a...was a slaughter.

39:26.460 --> 39:28.272
That's not how it happened.

39:28.297 --> 39:31.834
-Dunkirk was a hugely successful
allied evacuation mission,

39:31.858 --> 39:34.350
they rescued 400, 000 troops.

39:36.014 --> 39:37.481
-So if you're right...

39:38.467 --> 39:39.834
the past that we're in...

39:40.725 --> 39:42.076
is not the one that we know.

39:44.866 --> 39:46.466
Sorry about that, Nigel.

39:46.887 --> 39:49.272
<i>- Well, captain, I suppose
the question is</i>

39:49.296 --> 39:50.748
<i>How can I help?</i>

39:50.772 --> 39:52.561
-Right now, we need two things.

39:53.014 --> 39:54.014
A safe route

39:54.717 --> 39:56.384
and a safe place to land.

39:56.632 --> 39:57.632
And also

39:57.866 --> 39:59.498
any information you have on any

39:59.835 --> 40:01.686
unusual storms in the area.

40:02.069 --> 40:03.710
<i>-I'll do what I can, captain.</i>

40:03.734 --> 40:05.037
<i>What's your current position?</i>

40:05.248 --> 40:07.819
-We're near Vier,
near as we can tell.

40:08.046 --> 40:10.342
Just passed Rhen not too long ago.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.084
Heading in a straight line.

40:12.108 --> 40:14.108
-<i>You're nearing the German border, then.</i>

40:14.280 --> 40:16.013
<i>What's your current air speed?</i>

40:16.756 --> 40:17.756
-400 knots.

40:17.983 --> 40:19.912
<i>-I hate to say this, captain.</i>

40:19.936 --> 40:22.100
<i>But the first thing you need
 to do is change course.</i>

40:22.124 --> 40:24.584
<i>We've intercepted a
chat on German frequencies.</i>

40:24.982 --> 40:28.513
<i>There's been talk of a
rather large aircraft near France.</i>

40:29.282 --> 40:31.852
-So, whoever is performing
 these bombing runs,

40:32.595 --> 40:34.062
knows that we're here.

40:38.498 --> 40:42.239
Are there any friendlies in the
area? Anyone who can get their eyes on us?

40:42.263 --> 40:45.372
<i>-I've just got to say we 
don't know exactly where you are.</i>

40:45.396 --> 40:47.271
-What if we were more viable?

40:47.748 --> 40:49.091
-How'd you mean?

40:49.115 --> 40:51.278
-We've been flying
with our NAV lights off.

40:51.302 --> 40:54.419
But we can turn on our
landing and running lights.

40:54.662 --> 40:55.739
-Are you sure about that?

40:56.066 --> 40:58.066
Most of our systems are out.

40:58.091 --> 41:00.207
-They're analog, right?

41:03.924 --> 41:05.228
Here it goes.

41:29.535 --> 41:30.535
-Nigel?

41:31.042 --> 41:33.112
We've got something
coming straight for us.

41:33.145 --> 41:36.031
<i>-Uh, one moment, captain.</i>
<i>it could just be allies.</i>

41:39.430 --> 41:42.973
-Well, we've got company about
thirty seconds out coming fast!

41:42.998 --> 41:47.216
<i>-Well, captain, there  are no
sightings of any aircraft  in our area.</i>

41:47.482 --> 41:49.914
-Gentlemen, I need you
in your seats, now.

41:49.938 --> 41:52.835
And not a word to
anyone. Get everyone secured.

41:52.860 --> 41:54.570
-Will, I...
-Now.

42:00.276 --> 42:04.408
<i>-Captain, just got word that some</i>
 German activity is headed your way.

42:33.742 --> 42:35.809
<i>-All secure back here, captain.</i>

42:44.018 --> 42:45.618
-Some goddam Nazi plane.

42:46.072 --> 42:47.642
-They've got jets, too?

42:48.353 --> 42:50.353
They shouldn't have those yet.

42:57.898 --> 42:59.031
-Kill the lights.

43:26.819 --> 43:28.381
Talk to me, Daniel.

43:28.405 --> 43:29.944
-they're coming in behind us.

43:38.484 --> 43:39.758
-Oh, my God.

44:56.029 --> 44:58.095
-They're still on us!
-I know!

45:02.943 --> 45:05.286
<i>-Captain. Will, are you there?</i>

45:05.310 --> 45:07.677
-Not now, Nigel.
Getting shot at!

45:10.832 --> 45:13.035
<i>-IA 42, do you copy?</i>

45:13.998 --> 45:14.998
Damn it!

45:46.527 --> 45:48.417
-You got a plan?
-Yeah.

45:48.441 --> 45:49.808
Kind of.

45:50.504 --> 45:51.570
Don't freak out.

45:52.160 --> 45:53.519
-What? Why?

46:00.745 --> 46:02.034
3,000 feet.

46:09.816 --> 46:11.253
2,000 feet.

46:15.419 --> 46:17.099
Will, 1,000!

46:17.124 --> 46:20.739
-So long! Pull!!!

47:00.121 --> 47:02.511
-Two planes! Right behind us!

47:11.265 --> 47:13.843
-(groans in pain)
-Damn!

47:13.867 --> 47:15.429
Just hang on.

47:15.453 --> 47:18.468
We need first aid kid
in the cockpit, stat!

47:18.492 --> 47:21.934
Dan's been hit. Hang on buddy!
I got you!

47:21.958 --> 47:24.827
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

47:33.815 --> 47:35.882
-Hold on, buddy.
Just hold on.

47:35.905 --> 47:37.905
-(groans in pain)

47:47.379 --> 47:49.254
Ok, Ok, Ok...

47:49.715 --> 47:51.800
Alright. Let me take a look at it.

47:56.269 --> 47:58.355
it's not as bad as it looks.
You sure about that?

47:58.380 --> 47:59.134
It's mostly superficial.

47:59.159 --> 48:01.326
You're going to need some stitches,
but it's going to have to wait.

48:01.503 --> 48:02.135
You Ok?

48:02.160 --> 48:05.096
Yeah...It hurts like a son
of a bitch but I'll be fine.

48:05.268 --> 48:06.542
How's the plane?

48:06.566 --> 48:08.292
-Could be a lot worse.

48:08.316 --> 48:10.151
Burned some serious
fuel during that move.

48:10.176 --> 48:12.495
But not actively losing any,
We've lost cabin pressure.

48:12.519 --> 48:15.058
I'll keep us below 15,000 feet.
-Is that bad?

48:15.082 --> 48:16.456
-Definitely bad!

48:16.480 --> 48:18.167
-Probably have to cycle it again.

48:18.190 --> 48:21.143
-(groans in pain)
-Nigel!

48:21.168 --> 48:22.847
We've got a problem, buddy!

48:23.730 --> 48:24.730
Nigel!

48:24.754 --> 48:27.464
-(groans in pain) Did the radio get hit?
-No, it just got static.

48:27.488 --> 48:29.237
I think we're out of range.

48:29.261 --> 48:33.130
Oh, boy.
-So we can stay in cloud cover and stay safe

48:33.154 --> 48:35.740
or we could talk to our friend
Nigel and get shot at!

48:36.701 --> 48:39.412
And we can't land without
our front wheels. Perfect!

48:40.151 --> 48:41.940
-Captain?
-(groans in pain)

48:42.511 --> 48:44.044
-Just give me a minute.

48:44.073 --> 48:46.112
-Will, if the passengers know
what's going on,

48:46.144 --> 48:47.917
maybe some of them can help.

48:47.941 --> 48:50.838
We <i>have</i> to work together right
now. <i>All</i> of us.

48:52.573 --> 48:54.346
-Daniel, can you fly the plane?

48:54.370 --> 48:56.127
-Yeah, I think so, yeah.

48:56.760 --> 48:58.760
I'm going to need some
extra hands just in case.

48:58.784 --> 49:00.549
-Stay with him.

49:00.573 --> 49:02.823
Take my seat.
-Are you sure?

49:03.198 --> 49:04.198
-I'm sure.

49:05.120 --> 49:06.597
-Ok...
-Come on.

49:07.214 --> 49:08.214
Come on.

49:19.213 --> 49:21.197
-Sir, take your seat this instant.

49:21.237 --> 49:22.838
-Keep us in the dark?
-Sir...

49:22.863 --> 49:24.666
-We need to know if
we're gonna die out here.

49:24.691 --> 49:27.041
-I need you to calm down...
-You haven't told us <i>one</i> thing.

49:29.002 --> 49:31.658
-Sir...we want you to keep calm

49:32.331 --> 49:33.864
and take your seat. Ok?

49:40.149 --> 49:41.549
Ladies and gentlemen,

49:42.227 --> 49:43.361
I'm your captain.

49:43.704 --> 49:44.704
William Strong.

49:46.290 --> 49:47.356
And it's time...

49:48.329 --> 49:49.929
...I tell you the truth.

49:58.577 --> 50:00.709
-We're on the move, sir?
-Not you.

50:00.733 --> 50:02.053
We need you to stay put.

50:02.483 --> 50:03.756
Any news from our friends?

50:04.382 --> 50:05.382
Not much.

50:05.414 --> 50:07.873
Last I checked they were
in a <i>Don't fight Jerry's.</i>

50:08.147 --> 50:09.147
I lost contact.

50:09.358 --> 50:10.756
I fear that...

50:11.944 --> 50:13.623
(sigh) I'll keep trying, sir.

50:13.647 --> 50:16.452
-If you manage to make contact,
you'll have to gather information about their radar.

50:16.592 --> 50:18.537
-Yes sir. I'll do all I can.

50:20.592 --> 50:22.834
-If it really is some kind of super plane,

50:24.291 --> 50:26.306
better destroyed than captured by the axis.

50:28.361 --> 50:31.189
We may have no choice than
to blow the damn thing out of the sky ourselves.

50:36.690 --> 50:39.518
-I want to apologize for keeping
you in the dark for so long.

50:40.511 --> 50:44.690
We encountered what we thought
was a weather anomaly, but it is something more than that.

50:45.093 --> 50:48.772
Some of us, including my
co-pilot Daniel, believe

50:49.585 --> 50:51.985
that we have traveled back in time.

50:53.163 --> 50:54.811
With the assistance of these men

50:54.836 --> 50:57.749
as well as my contact on the ground,
we've determined

50:58.156 --> 50:59.469
That we're over France.

51:01.884 --> 51:03.017
These men believe

51:03.041 --> 51:05.041
it's currently

51:05.797 --> 51:07.229
1940.

51:11.704 --> 51:12.970
-That's impossible!

51:14.188 --> 51:15.188
-Regardless,

51:16.477 --> 51:17.477
We

51:18.118 --> 51:19.318
are in a war zone.

51:20.407 --> 51:22.007
And we're all in danger.

51:22.719 --> 51:25.688
If we stay invisible
we'll be safe.

51:27.485 --> 51:29.406
The most important thing
you can do, all of you,

51:29.930 --> 51:31.130
is to remain calm.

51:32.290 --> 51:35.110
All we can do is fly
and try to find a safe place to land.

51:37.352 --> 51:38.486
Do you all agree?

51:42.792 --> 51:44.059
As for the landing,

51:45.714 --> 51:47.447
The other planes that were

51:47.471 --> 51:49.471
firing at us have damaged our landing gear.

51:50.628 --> 51:51.628
It won't open.

51:53.362 --> 51:55.162
And we're trying to fix it.

51:56.073 --> 51:57.673
But I can't do it alone.

51:59.065 --> 52:00.399
Is there anyone here

52:01.222 --> 52:02.288
who can help me?

52:03.558 --> 52:05.224
Who's wiling to go below

52:06.534 --> 52:07.534
and help?

52:11.870 --> 52:12.870
-Captain?

52:14.667 --> 52:15.734
I'm an engineer.

52:16.792 --> 52:18.776
We...we're working
with hydraulics, right?

52:18.800 --> 52:20.151
-That's right.

52:20.948 --> 52:22.148
-I'll go with you.

52:24.151 --> 52:25.151
-Thank you...

52:26.386 --> 52:27.386
-Teresa.

52:28.026 --> 52:30.093
-That'll be great help, Teresa.

52:31.855 --> 52:32.855
Anyone else?

52:39.526 --> 52:42.315
-Es El minimo Que puedo
hacer.

52:45.190 --> 52:46.523
Yo los puedo ayudar.

52:47.443 --> 52:49.731
Eh...I can help.

52:50.474 --> 52:52.278
I...a handyman.

52:52.498 --> 52:53.498
As you say.

52:54.623 --> 52:56.690
-Thank you, mister...
-Hector.

52:57.178 --> 52:58.244
Me llamo Hector.

52:58.779 --> 53:01.313
-Happy to have you, Hector. Thank you.

53:02.350 --> 53:03.416
Much appreciated.

53:05.412 --> 53:06.945
We're gonna head below.

53:07.412 --> 53:08.638
The flight crew is in charge.

53:09.209 --> 53:10.841
Daniel will keep us in the air,

53:11.256 --> 53:13.989
if there's any trouble
he'll contact me.

53:14.482 --> 53:16.816
We're done keeping you in the dark.

53:17.107 --> 53:18.240
Now we're focused

53:18.865 --> 53:20.131
on keeping everyone

53:20.841 --> 53:21.841
safe.

53:23.740 --> 53:25.513
Teresa, Hector.

53:27.982 --> 53:28.982
Follow me.

53:38.982 --> 53:41.575
-You know time travel's impossible, right?

53:43.029 --> 53:44.029
-Of course I do.

53:44.607 --> 53:46.357
-All of things are possible

53:48.795 --> 53:49.995
if you have faith.

54:00.055 --> 54:01.055
-No puncture.

54:01.805 --> 54:03.149
That's good.

54:03.813 --> 54:05.346
-Captain, look at this.

54:07.437 --> 54:09.688
-Maybe...we can

54:10.243 --> 54:11.243
splice

54:18.869 --> 54:21.431
-You're on top of things.
I like that, Hector.

54:29.077 --> 54:31.131
Right, that should...do it.

54:31.960 --> 54:32.960
-Stay back,

54:33.780 --> 54:34.780
Stay back!

54:40.454 --> 54:43.555
Daniel! We've just opened the doors!

54:43.923 --> 54:45.719
Try the gear now!

54:46.180 --> 54:47.744
<i>-Copy that.</i>

54:52.859 --> 54:54.459
That's a negative, Will.

54:56.273 --> 54:58.218
-Look that. Look!

54:58.883 --> 54:59.883
-I see it!

55:00.351 --> 55:01.951
-We have to get that out!

55:02.437 --> 55:03.437
Hey Daniel!

55:04.005 --> 55:06.825
Try and close the landing gear again!

55:08.669 --> 55:09.736
-Did that do it?

55:11.915 --> 55:13.728
<i>-Back it up, Daniel!</i>

55:13.752 --> 55:15.752
Just turn the light off!

55:15.776 --> 55:19.121
Turn off the Nav gear
and take out that chapel!

55:19.340 --> 55:22.674
-That's insane!
-I'm out of better ideas.

55:23.285 --> 55:26.940
Daniel! We have to slow
her down to get out of the wind!

55:26.964 --> 55:29.971
Take her down to 150
knots or so, Ok?

55:35.478 --> 55:36.478
Hold on!

55:37.674 --> 55:38.674
-Done.

55:38.698 --> 55:40.698
I fix! I fix!

55:40.722 --> 55:42.722
-Hector, I can't let you!

55:42.746 --> 55:45.400
Wait!
It's two pilots!

55:45.424 --> 55:48.493
It's you. Please.

55:48.517 --> 55:50.517
Try, please.

56:16.842 --> 56:18.642
-I think that did it, Will.

56:22.459 --> 56:24.668
-Hector! Hang on!

56:31.066 --> 56:32.133
Hang on, Hector!

56:42.778 --> 56:44.245
-Hector!!!
-Hector!!!

56:48.989 --> 56:50.589
-Swing on to the wheels!

56:58.274 --> 57:00.474
Come on, Hector, you've got this!

57:00.498 --> 57:02.157
-Hector!

57:02.181 --> 57:04.181
Come on, Hector!

57:06.830 --> 57:09.433
Close the landing gear now!

57:11.229 --> 57:12.933
Come on, Hector!

57:15.596 --> 57:17.066
Take my hand!

57:17.471 --> 57:18.538
Come on, Hector!

57:25.390 --> 57:27.324
-Will, is everything alright?

57:29.008 --> 57:30.008
-We're Ok.

57:30.672 --> 57:32.605
Hang tight. We're coming out.

57:52.204 --> 57:53.937
The landing gear is fixed.

57:54.844 --> 57:56.844
Thanks to these two heroes over here.

58:10.243 --> 58:11.243
How's it going?

58:11.406 --> 58:13.742
We've burned most of
our fuel in the one with those moves.

58:13.767 --> 58:16.220
Got about 90 minutes
of flight time give or take.

58:16.245 --> 58:18.010
-How's our go heading?

58:18.035 --> 58:20.885
-Should be almost to the
border between France and Switzerland.

58:20.909 --> 58:23.285
Good work, Brianna.
I'll take over.

58:23.309 --> 58:25.710
-Ok.
-We need to contact Nigel. Tell him that

58:25.735 --> 58:27.144
we don't have much time.

58:27.168 --> 58:28.824
We have to go below the clouds.

58:29.121 --> 58:31.188
-I already got shot once today.

58:39.883 --> 58:41.203
-Ladies and gentlemen,

58:41.228 --> 58:42.718
<i>we will be making a descent.</i>

58:42.742 --> 58:44.742
<i>in order to establish radio contact.</i>

58:57.045 --> 58:58.045
Nigel...

58:58.069 --> 59:00.069
Come in.
Can you hear me?

59:01.193 --> 59:02.668
-<i>Captain Strong.</i>

59:03.518 --> 59:05.771
-Nigel, good to hear your voice!

59:06.006 --> 59:07.099
-<i>My God.</i>

59:07.365 --> 59:09.709
You broke off contact so abruptly I...

59:10.319 --> 59:11.920
...I feared the worst.

59:12.419 --> 59:14.676
<i>How on earth did you
manage to lose those planes?</i>

59:14.701 --> 59:16.701
-We had to deceive them by
going above the clouds.

59:16.725 --> 59:19.619
At least now we know
where our radio transmission ranges.

59:20.783 --> 59:22.783
-<i>What's your current location?</i>

59:22.808 --> 59:24.877
-We're just above the Swiss border.

59:24.901 --> 59:28.033
We have about eighty minutes
of flying left, which isn't a lot of time

59:28.056 --> 59:29.477
to figure things out.

59:29.502 --> 59:32.361
<i>-Earlier you mentioned
something about a</i>...uh..

59:32.955 --> 59:34.073
.weather anomaly

59:34.096 --> 59:35.916
<i>-That's right...</i>

59:35.940 --> 59:38.064
before we got displaced

59:38.088 --> 59:40.088
we went through the center of a storm

59:40.112 --> 59:42.112
the likes of which I've never seen.

59:42.136 --> 59:45.877
Black clouds and some kind of
a blue energy in the center of it.

59:45.901 --> 59:48.174
<i>-Right. I'll investigate.</i>

59:48.361 --> 59:53.665
Now, the most pressing is
your proximity to German air space.

59:53.689 --> 59:55.844
<i>I suggest you stay on course.</i>

59:55.869 --> 59:58.025
I'm trying to find a potential
landing spot for you.

59:58.932 --> 01:00:01.599
<i>And my commanding
officer</i> is insisting

01:00:01.623 --> 01:00:05.134
that I get more information
on this...radar of yours.

01:00:05.447 --> 01:00:06.822
-What do you want to know, Nigel?

01:00:06.846 --> 01:00:08.846
-Well, everything you can tell me.

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:10.509
-Captain, may I?

01:00:13.205 --> 01:00:14.605
<i>-Sir, this is Bennett.</i>

01:00:14.728 --> 01:00:17.195
<i>The radar is</i> on the nose
of the plane and gives

01:00:17.227 --> 01:00:20.337
off radio waves to determine
 the objects in the area.

01:00:20.407 --> 01:00:24.360
In the cockpit there is a console
that looks like a bulls-eye.

01:00:24.384 --> 01:00:27.755
And it sweeps the area for...
for signals, put blips on the screen

01:00:27.779 --> 01:00:29.427
indicating our distance.

01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:30.646
That's about it.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:32.670
<i>It certainly sounds simple enough</i>

01:00:32.694 --> 01:00:34.694
Also sounds incredibly useful.

01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.857
-It's kept us alive so far, Nigel.

01:00:36.881 --> 01:00:38.220
<i>-Well hopefully you Americans</i>

01:00:38.245 --> 01:00:40.710
will get involved in the war
sooner rather than later

01:00:40.735 --> 01:00:42.481
and you can help us out
in the technology front.

01:00:42.841 --> 01:00:45.583
-Like I said, Nigel,
we'd give to you if we could.

01:00:46.053 --> 01:00:48.774
<i>William</i>, there's something
else you should know.

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:52.282
<i>My commanding officer...</i>
-Shit!

01:00:52.306 --> 01:00:54.524
We got company again, Nigel!

01:01:09.407 --> 01:01:11.082
We might lose you again, Nigel!

01:01:11.106 --> 01:01:13.106
-<i>Just keep yourself safe.</i>

01:01:17.084 --> 01:01:19.006
-Will, incoming!

01:01:48.475 --> 01:01:49.542
-Where are they?

01:01:49.566 --> 01:01:51.982
-We've got one behind and one ahead!

01:01:57.918 --> 01:02:00.394
-OK, let's do this.

01:02:01.988 --> 01:02:02.988
-Will?

01:02:05.926 --> 01:02:06.926
Will?

01:02:08.692 --> 01:02:09.692
William!

01:02:09.716 --> 01:02:11.184
-Hold on!

01:02:11.208 --> 01:02:13.793
Hold on...hold on...

01:02:13.817 --> 01:02:15.817
Hold on!

01:02:46.611 --> 01:02:48.998
How's everybody back there?
The passengers? The crew?

01:02:49.023 --> 01:02:50.176
-Uh...a few wrecked windows

01:02:50.201 --> 01:02:52.654
and everybody's really shaking
but we'll be fine. So....

01:02:53.213 --> 01:02:54.218
-Thanks.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.424
-Let's talk options.
-We're stuck.

01:02:58.081 --> 01:03:00.697
The radar only gives us
a small amount of warning.

01:03:00.722 --> 01:03:03.814
Which leaves our window to
talk to Nigel very tiny.

01:03:03.838 --> 01:03:06.299
-That's because the radar's
 localized to <i>us</i>.

01:03:06.638 --> 01:03:08.410
We're the epicenter of
the signal, right?

01:03:08.434 --> 01:03:10.434
And can only track what's right around us?
-That's right.

01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:12.715
-What if we had a radar on the ground?

01:03:13.552 --> 01:03:16.270
One we could
use to track enemy fighters.

01:03:16.895 --> 01:03:18.762
-That could be helpful, yes.

01:03:19.145 --> 01:03:20.145
-So?

01:03:21.028 --> 01:03:22.628
-Let's give it to Nigel.

01:03:23.285 --> 01:03:24.785
-Nigel's story doesn't make sense.

01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:27.931
They..they should have...
radar by now.

01:03:28.775 --> 01:03:31.251
The way he talks, it makes
it seem like it's years off.

01:03:32.018 --> 01:03:34.018
-Maybe this is why we're here.

01:03:34.127 --> 01:03:35.463
Not to kill Hitler, but

01:03:35.487 --> 01:03:37.830
maybe we bring radar to the British.

01:03:37.854 --> 01:03:40.197
We could cut it out of
 the nose of the plane.

01:03:40.221 --> 01:03:42.221
-Air drop it to an
agreed upon spot?

01:03:42.814 --> 01:03:45.174
They could hook it
up and be our air traffic control.

01:03:45.846 --> 01:03:47.779
-What about changing history?

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:49.757
-From what we heard,

01:03:49.976 --> 01:03:51.976
seems like history has
<i>already</i> been changed.

01:03:52.267 --> 01:03:54.000
They lost the battle at Dunkirk.

01:03:54.475 --> 01:03:56.475
Who knows what...
what's different out there?

01:03:57.479 --> 01:03:59.515
This could get them
and <i>us</i>

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:01.416
back to the history we remember.

01:04:02.393 --> 01:04:03.393
Maybe

01:04:04.026 --> 01:04:06.026
Maybe this can fix everything.

01:04:07.088 --> 01:04:08.088
-Will...

01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:10.845
you may not believe in time travel, but

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.448
you said yourself.

01:04:13.299 --> 01:04:14.699
We're out of options.

01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:18.330
-Will?

01:04:19.401 --> 01:04:24.201
-Let's call Nigel and tell
him he's getting an early Christmas present.

01:04:26.989 --> 01:04:28.535
Holy shit, a missile!

01:04:55.568 --> 01:04:56.568
Fire up again.

01:05:06.042 --> 01:05:07.042
Again!

01:05:14.136 --> 01:05:15.536
It's alright, people.

01:05:17.964 --> 01:05:18.964
Nigel, come in!

01:05:21.995 --> 01:05:22.995
Come in, Nigel!

01:05:23.058 --> 01:05:25.440
<i>-Will, thank God! I thought
 I lost you for good!</i>

01:05:25.464 --> 01:05:27.268
-You're still here for
the moment, my friend.

01:05:27.293 --> 01:05:29.286
Almost got note to piss fire.

01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:31.949
Missile.
<i>-A missile? from an airplane?</i>

01:05:31.974 --> 01:05:33.974
No, I think is a surface to air.

01:05:34.208 --> 01:05:37.160
<i>-Will, I feel I mist tell you...</i>
-Nigel, listen...

01:05:37.523 --> 01:05:40.262
we're about one-hundred
miles from the Swiss border.

01:05:40.287 --> 01:05:42.287
We want to give you a gift.

01:05:42.576 --> 01:05:44.231
Our radar.

01:05:44.435 --> 01:05:46.007
Think you can find us a drop site?

01:05:46.032 --> 01:05:48.905
<i>-Captain, Will, are you sure
you want to do that?</i>

01:05:49.014 --> 01:05:51.014
It is our only way

01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:53.437
to find a clear path to a friendlier sky.

01:05:53.812 --> 01:05:57.507
-Will, you should be somewhere
near Mets at the moment, <i>correct</i> ?

01:05:57.718 --> 01:05:58.585
-That's correct.

01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:01.289
<i>-We should be crossing over
Berlin-Bresel in ten minutes.</i>

01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:02.351
That's right.

01:06:02.376 --> 01:06:04.806
<i>I'm damn certain they're doing
this to intercept the radar</i>

01:06:04.831 --> 01:06:06.601
<i>if you you'll be able
to make it your own.</i>

01:06:07.132 --> 01:06:10.069
-We'll make it.
<i>-Then I have to sign off.</i>

01:06:10.094 --> 01:06:12.781
Ten minutes in the forest in German territory.

01:06:12.983 --> 01:06:15.342
<i>You can't miss it.</i>
-We'll get it to you.

01:06:15.733 --> 01:06:17.366
-Godspeed my friend.

01:06:17.593 --> 01:06:19.226
Over and out.

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:22.404
-You heard him.
Ten minutes.

01:06:22.429 --> 01:06:25.437
I'll have you and Gary heading down. 
Take Hector and Theresa with you.

01:06:25.461 --> 01:06:27.672
Cut the box out of the nose.

01:06:27.953 --> 01:06:29.945
Buckle it with the screen.

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:33.468
Dale,  we need to make
this plane get a smooth ride.

01:06:33.492 --> 01:06:38.013
Make something that will make
 it survive a drop about a a few thousand feet.

01:06:39.623 --> 01:06:40.623
Ok...

01:06:44.629 --> 01:06:45.629
-Ah, Sheffield.

01:06:45.654 --> 01:06:48.706
-You must listen to me. We can't
make another attempt to target them.

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:50.339
We have to help them get to safety.

01:06:50.364 --> 01:06:51.895
-Nigel, we've talked about
what would happen...

01:06:51.918 --> 01:06:53.918
-They're going to give
us their radar system

01:06:53.942 --> 01:06:57.839
Air drop it to us. The only
way we can get it is if you call off the bloody attacks.

01:06:59.183 --> 01:07:02.222
-Corporal, call off all service air strikes
immediately! immediately!
-Yes, sir!

01:07:16.076 --> 01:07:17.476
-Are these your bags?

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.419
Do you have anything we may
be able to use as a...a parachute?

01:07:21.247 --> 01:07:24.052
-I'm looking for anything we can use
as some sort of parachute.

01:07:25.357 --> 01:07:27.357
-I think...I think I can help.

01:07:30.938 --> 01:07:34.250
I picked these up for grand kids.
I mean, they leave in London.

01:07:34.274 --> 01:07:35.921
-Thank you so much.

01:07:45.501 --> 01:07:46.501
-Get a bag.

01:07:48.766 --> 01:07:49.766
-Alright.

01:07:58.556 --> 01:08:00.023
Tie it to the zippers.

01:08:02.637 --> 01:08:03.637
-Hey Daniel.

01:08:04.386 --> 01:08:05.676
How to power?

01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:10.797
-I need a USB battery.
 Does anyone have one?

01:08:11.176 --> 01:08:12.176
-I have one.

01:08:12.402 --> 01:08:13.469
-I...I have one.

01:08:24.843 --> 01:08:26.296
-Alright. You got it all in there?

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.947
Got it. Let's go.
Let's go!

01:08:34.971 --> 01:08:36.425
Go, go, go!

01:08:36.916 --> 01:08:37.970
-Bennett!

01:08:37.993 --> 01:08:39.993
Made it ten thousand feet.
Let her rip!

01:08:41.026 --> 01:08:42.426
-Roger that, captain!

01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:57.192
One...two...three!

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:11.095
Captain, the package is in the air!
I repeat, the package is in the air!

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.120
-Nigel, the package is away.
<i>-brilliant.</i>

01:09:13.144 --> 01:09:15.274
We're sending troops to capture it now.

01:09:15.299 --> 01:09:17.299
-Were gonna start climbing now!

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.978
<i>-Leave double time.</i>

01:09:19.002 --> 01:09:21.205
Our code breaker is
hearing a lot of chatter.

01:09:21.728 --> 01:09:23.649
<i>You're gonna have company very soon.</i>

01:09:58.841 --> 01:10:01.770
-Go. let's get out! come on
guys, out.

01:10:03.606 --> 01:10:05.395
-Bush! Now!

01:10:24.352 --> 01:10:26.945
-Nigel! We don't have much time!

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:29.937
How's the positioning looking?

01:10:30.016 --> 01:10:31.952
-It should be here in any moment.

01:10:31.976 --> 01:10:33.546
Just hold on.

01:10:53.592 --> 01:10:55.037
-Go kid go!

01:11:07.098 --> 01:11:08.810
-<i>Will, we've got the package.</i>

01:11:08.835 --> 01:11:11.644
<i>It's en route.</i>
-It's on route to <i>you</i> ?

01:11:12.292 --> 01:11:14.597
-I'm the closest radio
operator to the drop site.

01:11:15.762 --> 01:11:16.762
-Nigel!

01:11:16.786 --> 01:11:18.331
You are our guardian angel.

01:11:24.152 --> 01:11:25.152
-Look out!

01:12:36.792 --> 01:12:37.932
-Bloody hell, you found it!

01:12:52.585 --> 01:12:54.874
<i>Will, we have the radar.</i>

01:12:55.313 --> 01:12:59.109
-Great work, Nigel. Now work fast.

01:13:06.484 --> 01:13:09.820
We're almost out of fuel.
We need eyes in the sky...now!

01:13:11.575 --> 01:13:12.575
-Uh...

01:13:16.638 --> 01:13:17.638
There!

01:13:17.662 --> 01:13:18.942
scanning the skies now.

01:13:20.708 --> 01:13:22.255
Uh...Ok

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.170
Captain.

01:13:23.193 --> 01:13:25.317
Turn yourself easten to Heathrow now!

01:13:25.562 --> 01:13:26.859
-Are you <i>sure</i>, Nigel?

01:13:26.884 --> 01:13:28.884
<i>-Yes, I'm sure. Now move!</i>

01:14:05.117 --> 01:14:06.784
Shit! I can't shake them!

01:14:14.970 --> 01:14:17.766
-Right oh! Let's shoot these bastards
out of the sky.

01:14:26.194 --> 01:14:29.678
-It really is World War II. It
just could not be anything else.

01:14:34.163 --> 01:14:36.096
-Where did the fire come from?

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:39.728
<i>-Oh, my college arrived.</i>
-nigel, you beautiful bastard.

01:14:39.752 --> 01:14:42.493
-You were right. It
really <i>is</i> 1940.

01:14:42.516 --> 01:14:44.305
<i>-Yes, of course it is.</i>

01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:46.463
<i>We should have clear skies.</i>

01:14:46.799 --> 01:14:48.970
I'll direct you to a safe landing.

01:14:50.437 --> 01:14:51.437
I...

01:14:52.648 --> 01:14:55.382
can't be certain I'm reading
this correctly,

01:14:55.914 --> 01:14:58.116
It's a rather large....blip up front.

01:14:58.414 --> 01:15:00.712
-Is it another airplane?
Should we reroute?

01:15:00.945 --> 01:15:02.945
<i>-Um...it appears to be stationary.</i>

01:15:03.413 --> 01:15:05.326
<i>You should be able to see it.</i>

01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:06.974
<i>it's there ahead.</i>

01:15:07.264 --> 01:15:09.264
<i>What are you seeing, gentlemen?</i>

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:11.843
-it's that vortex.

01:15:11.867 --> 01:15:14.084
<i>The one that brought us here.
It's the same one!</i>

01:15:15.187 --> 01:15:16.695
We have to go through.

01:15:17.897 --> 01:15:19.949
We've got about ten minutes, Nigel!

01:15:20.091 --> 01:15:23.695
<i>-Still trying to head</i> a suitable
 landing site for you within range.

01:15:24.399 --> 01:15:27.110
-Well, all I know is the thing
that brought us here.

01:15:27.134 --> 01:15:30.031
We can't make it to a safe landing in 1940.

01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:33.418
<i>As much as I hate to admit it,</i>

01:15:33.668 --> 01:15:34.967
this is your best option.

01:15:37.147 --> 01:15:38.614
-ladies and gentlemen,

01:15:38.637 --> 01:15:40.637
things are going to be bumpy again.

01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:43.060
I want to thank you for your patience

01:15:43.084 --> 01:15:46.021
persistence, and your faith
in the last few hours.

01:15:47.327 --> 01:15:49.183
I'm proud of each and every one of you.

01:15:49.951 --> 01:15:53.474
-That felt like a goodbye.
-We'll find out in a few minutes.

01:16:06.928 --> 01:16:07.928
Nigel.

01:16:07.952 --> 01:16:10.467
I can't thank you enough
for everything you've done.

01:16:11.755 --> 01:16:13.402
-That's what allies do, captain.

01:16:14.186 --> 01:16:15.786
- Take care of yourself.

01:16:16.865 --> 01:16:18.598
-You do the same, captain.

01:16:18.803 --> 01:16:21.404
<i>You and everyone of flight 42.</i>

01:16:25.865 --> 01:16:27.091
- Here we go!

01:17:20.133 --> 01:17:22.976
<i>-Flight IA 42, Jesus Christ,
where did you go?</i>

01:17:23.289 --> 01:17:25.314
<i>We got you almost direct over Germany.</i>

01:17:25.339 --> 01:17:27.579
We're flying on vapors.

01:17:27.604 --> 01:17:29.055
We got to land now.

01:17:37.742 --> 01:17:39.998
<i>-IA-42 this is TXL tower.</i>

01:17:40.311 --> 01:17:44.319
<i>We're clearing the pattern and
sending out emergency equipment.</i>

01:17:48.858 --> 01:17:51.030
<i>IA-42, the roadways are clear.</i>

01:17:51.054 --> 01:17:52.640
<i>Bring her in.</i>

01:17:54.218 --> 01:17:55.485
-We're out of fuel!

01:17:56.203 --> 01:17:57.203
-OK...

01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.747
Let's glide this baby

01:18:03.199 --> 01:18:08.399
<i>-IA-42, choose a runway at your discretion.
They are all clear. Bring her in.</i>

01:18:19.937 --> 01:18:21.235
-Drop the flaps.

01:18:32.355 --> 01:18:33.652
Gear down.

01:18:36.496 --> 01:18:38.097
Pressed early.

01:18:41.262 --> 01:18:43.329
He pressed early, that's right.

01:18:44.012 --> 01:18:45.332
There she goes.

01:18:59.505 --> 01:19:00.684
TXL...

01:19:00.934 --> 01:19:02.934
This is flight 42.

01:19:03.404 --> 01:19:04.903
We have touched down

01:19:05.138 --> 01:19:07.138
safe and sound.

01:19:12.017 --> 01:19:14.102
-<i>copy that, flight IA-42.</i>

01:19:14.845 --> 01:19:16.045
<i>Welcome to Berlin.</i>

01:19:16.759 --> 01:19:17.759
-TXL?

01:19:19.665 --> 01:19:20.665
-What year is it?

01:19:22.235 --> 01:19:24.078
<i>-I like your sense of humor, captain.</i>

01:19:24.467 --> 01:19:25.837
<i>Welcome back.</i>

01:19:28.862 --> 01:19:29.929
-I love Germany.

01:19:32.698 --> 01:19:33.698
-<i>This</i> Germany.

01:20:23.216 --> 01:20:24.349
-That's everyone.

01:20:24.661 --> 01:20:27.114
There's one more gentleman
in the back, though.

01:20:27.138 --> 01:20:29.138
-I'll take a look. You go.

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:33.103
-Excuse me sir.

01:20:33.349 --> 01:20:34.682
it's time to go now.

01:20:35.849 --> 01:20:38.207
-Oh, just one more moment, captain, I'm...

01:20:38.231 --> 01:20:40.231
just finishing something up here.

01:20:58.758 --> 01:21:01.109
Terribly sorry to
have kept you waiting, but

01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:02.570
I'm ready now.

01:21:07.602 --> 01:21:10.093
As they say, there's no
time like the present.

01:21:11.398 --> 01:21:12.398
Shall we go?

01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:15.250
Thank you.
