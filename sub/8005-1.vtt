00:19.285 --> 00:22.487
<i>This is a story that begins
on a warm spring night...</i>

00:22.488 --> 00:25.211
<i>at a meeting of the 20th
Century Motors employees.</i>

00:27.059 --> 00:29.997
<i>It was a night
I'll never forget.</i>

00:31.597 --> 00:34.800
<i>When the owner of the company
died, his children took over...</i>

00:34.801 --> 00:38.069
<i>and brought in a new plan
to run the factory.</i>

00:38.070 --> 00:42.474
<i>The plan was that everybody would
work as hard as they could,</i>

00:42.475 --> 00:46.778
<i>but share in their salaries
and the profit based on need...</i>

00:46.779 --> 00:49.648
<i>That is, those who claimed
they needed the money most...</i>

00:49.649 --> 00:51.594
<i>were the ones
who got paid the most.</i>

00:56.289 --> 01:00.492
This is a crucial moment
in the history of this company.

01:00.493 --> 01:04.662
Now remember, each of us
now belongs to the other...

01:04.663 --> 01:07.497
by the moral law we all voted
for and we all accept.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.040
I don't.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.676
I don't accept it.

01:16.676 --> 01:19.511
<i>His words caused confusion,</i>

01:19.512 --> 01:23.948
<i>but he stood there like a man
who knew he was right.</i>

01:23.949 --> 01:28.724
And I'm going to put a stop
to this once and for all.

01:31.724 --> 01:33.663
How?

01:36.663 --> 01:38.799
I'll stop
the motor of the world.

01:39.799 --> 01:41.267
Who is that guy?

01:44.537 --> 01:47.375
<i>And with those words,
he was gone.</i>

01:48.975 --> 01:52.845
<i>In the 12 years that followed, lights
went out in the great factories...</i>

01:53.045 --> 01:57.348
<i>which had stood as solid
as oak trees for generations.</i>

01:57.349 --> 02:02.987
<i>Their gates closed as if some silent power
had turned them into lifeless shells.</i>

02:02.988 --> 02:06.000
<i>The world was quietly crumbling
with no end in sight.</i>

02:14.000 --> 02:17.234
<i>The high seas
weren't safe anymore.</i>

02:17.235 --> 02:19.402
<i>Cargo no longer reached
its destination.</i>

02:25.110 --> 02:29.079
<i>Shortages grounded airlines and it
was too expensive for most to drive.</i>

02:29.080 --> 02:34.020
<i>Regulations strangled the production
of coal, gas, oil and nuclear power.</i>

02:34.934 --> 02:38.323
<i>Power outages were frequent because
no copper was available...</i>

02:38.324 --> 02:40.859
<i>to maintain
the transmission lines.</i>

02:40.860 --> 02:44.362
<i>Taggart Transcontinental, the
largest railroad in the country,</i>

02:44.363 --> 02:46.641
<i>was one of the few things
still operating.</i>

02:49.502 --> 02:53.204
<i>We began to wonder, we began to
talk about what he'd said...</i>

02:53.205 --> 02:55.639
<i>and thought maybe
he'd kept his word...</i>

02:55.640 --> 02:58.418
<i>That perhaps he had stopped
the motor of the world.</i>

03:00.380 --> 03:05.382
<i>Some even tried to look for him, but
he had vanished without a trace,</i>

03:05.383 --> 03:07.257
<i>and so had
a lot of other people.</i>

03:11.257 --> 03:15.173
<i>We wondered what sort of impossible
power he had to keep his promise.</i>

03:27.173 --> 03:32.553
<i>All the best and the brightest seemed
to be disappearing without explanation.</i>

03:40.509 --> 03:42.787
<i>Perhaps people kept asking
the question...</i>

03:42.788 --> 03:46.592
<i>because they knew something had
gone missing from the world.</i>

03:48.661 --> 03:51.839
<i>Perhaps this is why
we began to say it.</i>

04:00.741 --> 04:03.741
<i>We couldn't help but think
of the young lab engineer...</i>

04:03.742 --> 04:06.311
<i>who said he would stop
the motor of the world.</i>

04:06.312 --> 04:07.646
<i>You see, his name was...</i>

04:08.014 --> 04:09.514
Who is John Galt?
<i>John Galt.</i>

04:57.428 --> 04:59.330
Don't... Don't move.

04:59.331 --> 05:00.776
Miss Taggart, you're hurt.

05:02.502 --> 05:05.502
You know me.
For many years.

05:05.637 --> 05:08.637
Do I know you?
I think you do.

05:10.142 --> 05:13.947
- What is your name?
- John Galt.

05:15.947 --> 05:18.282
Your name is John Galt.

05:18.283 --> 05:20.552
Why does that frighten you?

05:20.553 --> 05:22.322
Because I believe you.

05:24.322 --> 05:25.890
Was it you I was following?

05:25.891 --> 05:27.531
Yes.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.734
Where's your plane?

05:36.735 --> 05:39.339
It's...
It's on the landing strip.

05:40.339 --> 05:41.873
Landing strip?

05:41.874 --> 05:44.508
On the other side of the valley.

05:44.509 --> 05:46.109
There was no...
There was nothing.

05:46.110 --> 05:47.645
Look. Closely.

05:47.646 --> 05:50.220
You see that refracted image?

05:54.220 --> 05:56.904
It's to keep out the uninvited.

06:12.794 --> 06:15.239
I'll call Doc Hendricks.
See what you can do.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.240
Right.

06:21.779 --> 06:24.223
Hey, Doc.
Yeah, it's the plane.

06:32.223 --> 06:35.126
Dagny. Are you all right?

06:35.127 --> 06:36.794
Is that Dr. Akston?

06:36.795 --> 06:38.830
Well, thank goodness for that.

06:38.831 --> 06:40.931
I saved what I could
from the wreck.

06:40.932 --> 06:43.701
The last time I saw you, I told
you you would never find him...

06:43.702 --> 06:46.536
- and now here you are in his arms.
- In whose arms?

06:47.005 --> 06:49.950
The man you were looking for...
My philosophy student.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.312
The man who invented the motor.

06:54.312 --> 06:56.119
You invented the motor?

07:00.119 --> 07:02.790
You're lucky
you didn't break your neck.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.391
- Is she all right?
- Appears to be.

07:07.392 --> 07:09.059
Well, we didn't plan for this.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.634
She'll be my responsibility.

07:15.634 --> 07:17.669
Where are we?

07:17.670 --> 07:19.237
Mulligan's Valley.

07:19.238 --> 07:21.408
Midas.

07:22.408 --> 07:25.408
That was quite a stunt, Dagny.
What are you doing here?

07:25.444 --> 07:27.445
I saw your plane.

07:27.446 --> 07:29.147
I never imagined
it was being piloted...

07:29.148 --> 07:32.951
by one of only two people
still missing from this valley.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.419
Who's the other?

07:34.420 --> 07:36.021
Hank Rearden, of course.

07:39.591 --> 07:41.762
Glad you're in one piece.

07:43.762 --> 07:46.364
Doc Hendricks will meet you.

07:46.365 --> 07:48.698
If she's up for it, bring
her by my house tonight.

07:48.699 --> 07:50.923
I'll arrange something.

08:44.923 --> 08:47.923
Your house?
Mine, yeah.

08:49.394 --> 08:51.032
All right.
Nice and easy.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.298
Hi, Dagny.

08:55.299 --> 08:57.835
I am Dr. Thomas Hendricks.

08:57.836 --> 09:00.454
May I have a look at your injuries?
The neurosurgeon?

09:00.455 --> 09:04.578
Yes. But here in the valley, I
practice other medicine as well.

09:07.578 --> 09:11.449
Okay. This will only take
a second.

09:11.450 --> 09:16.120
It's a diagnostic device I
developed here in Atlantis.

09:17.923 --> 09:19.990
Every doctor should have one.

09:19.991 --> 09:22.991
It's amazing what can be
accomplished without red tape.

09:28.899 --> 09:32.704
Okay. Good news.
Nothing serious.

09:32.705 --> 09:35.239
Sprained ankle,
some bruised ribs.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.374
No sign of a concussion.

09:37.375 --> 09:42.714
So, I would like you to stay off your
feet for a few days and get some rest.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.815
Call me if you have
any questions.

09:44.816 --> 09:47.185
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome.

09:47.186 --> 09:48.786
Send me the bill.

09:48.787 --> 09:51.690
Absolutely not. No, I...
I will pay for this myself.

09:53.357 --> 09:59.065
- We'll discuss that later.
- Our first trespasser.

10:00.065 --> 10:02.403
- Thank you, Doctor.
- All right.

10:05.403 --> 10:07.772
So you invented the motor?

10:07.773 --> 10:09.482
Let's get you to your room.

10:18.482 --> 10:20.482
I can walk.
I know.

10:24.055 --> 10:25.159
Here we are.

10:29.159 --> 10:33.000
- Am I a guest or a prisoner?
- Well, that choice is yours.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.569
How can I make that choice when
I'm dealing with a stranger?

10:37.570 --> 10:39.135
But you're not.

10:39.136 --> 10:41.272
Didn't you name the John
Galt line after me?

10:41.273 --> 10:44.374
Yes, I did. But I named it
after my enemy.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.845
Well, that's the contradiction you're
going to have to figure out...

10:46.846 --> 10:49.547
sooner or later.

10:49.548 --> 10:51.715
It was you, wasn't it?

10:51.716 --> 10:53.685
You destroyed my line.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.056
You're the destroyer.
Get some rest.

10:57.056 --> 10:58.623
Midas invited us to dinner.

10:58.624 --> 11:02.013
There will be some people there
looking forward to seeing you.

11:03.394 --> 11:05.037
Why should I trust you?

11:12.037 --> 11:14.739
<i>The world crisis was worsening.</i>

11:14.740 --> 11:18.109
<i>And as the head of state announced
that he would address the nation,</i>

11:18.110 --> 11:20.811
<i>word was spreading quickly
that another giant of industry,</i>

11:20.812 --> 11:23.214
<i>Dagny Taggart, had gone missing.</i>

11:23.215 --> 11:26.151
<i>Meanwhile, the government
again increased its reward...</i>

11:26.152 --> 11:29.941
<i>for the capture of pirate
Ragnar Danneskold.</i>

11:51.643 --> 11:56.114
Dagny. For a woman that just dropped out
of the sky, you look pretty damn good.

11:56.115 --> 11:58.651
Thank you, Midas. And you...
You look just the same.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.394
Come on in.

12:09.394 --> 12:12.931
Ladies and gentlemen,
Taggart Transcontinental.

12:17.235 --> 12:18.740
Hear, hear!

12:21.740 --> 12:24.709
Dagny, it's wonderful
to have you here.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.844
Enjoy the evening.

12:26.845 --> 12:28.512
Thank you, Rebecca.

12:28.513 --> 12:30.849
Everyone here has a story.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.850
Is that Kay Ludlow?
Straight from Hollywood.

12:35.721 --> 12:37.488
How did you get here, Midas?

12:37.489 --> 12:42.359
Me? I made my fortune lending people money
to buy houses and build businesses,

12:42.360 --> 12:45.229
and I only loaned to those people
I was confident could repay me.

12:45.230 --> 12:49.230
Sure. They called me heartless,
which I could live with.

12:49.433 --> 12:54.638
But when they forced me to give loans
to people who could never pay me back,

12:54.639 --> 12:56.407
I got the hell out.

12:56.408 --> 12:59.312
Come. You must be hungry.

13:02.312 --> 13:06.417
When the politicians started
making medical decisions for me,

13:06.418 --> 13:08.951
I decided I couldn't
be a party to it anymore.

13:08.952 --> 13:13.258
Here in this valley, I treat my patients
using my professional judgment,

13:13.259 --> 13:15.725
not some political directive.

13:15.726 --> 13:19.095
Dagny, we are on strike.

13:19.096 --> 13:23.566
What happened to Midas,
what happened to Doc,

13:23.567 --> 13:25.072
it happened to each of us.

13:27.072 --> 13:30.240
No man belongs
to another, Dagny.

13:30.241 --> 13:33.741
But there are those in power who
would have you think otherwise.

13:34.011 --> 13:36.314
We honor charity
and benevolence,

13:36.315 --> 13:39.282
but it must be provided
on the giver's terms...

13:39.283 --> 13:41.053
Voluntarily, and not by force.

13:41.698 --> 13:44.754
The powerful try to make us
feel guilty for our success.

13:44.755 --> 13:47.992
And we are guilty... guilty
for sacrificing ourselves...

13:47.993 --> 13:50.062
and for working
under their terms.

13:51.062 --> 13:54.734
So we had to withdraw,
to go on strike.

13:55.734 --> 13:57.969
But what about
what you left behind?

13:57.970 --> 13:59.970
We left nothing behind, Dagny.

13:59.971 --> 14:04.074
What... We took with us
the only real thing of value.

14:04.075 --> 14:07.714
Dagny, this is a strike
of our minds.

14:09.714 --> 14:11.816
So what are you demanding?

14:11.817 --> 14:15.653
Nothing. We're not trying to impose our
values on the world that we left behind.

14:15.654 --> 14:18.355
They're free to continue to believe
as they want, whatever they want.

14:18.356 --> 14:20.557
But they're going to have
to do it without our help.

14:20.558 --> 14:22.496
Hear, hear.

14:25.496 --> 14:26.830
Dagny.

14:26.831 --> 14:28.402
Ellis Wyatt.

14:30.402 --> 14:32.538
I can't believe it.

14:33.538 --> 14:35.172
I felt abandoned.

14:35.173 --> 14:39.109
I finished the John Galt line to move
your oil, and you disappeared on me.

14:39.110 --> 14:42.881
You quit when I needed you most.

14:43.881 --> 14:45.548
All of you did.

14:45.549 --> 14:47.484
Now you know why.

14:47.485 --> 14:52.489
Well, perhaps, but you made a very
difficult task nearly impossible.

14:52.490 --> 14:57.695
Dagny, I couldn't keep supporting a
system that was determined to destroy me.

14:57.696 --> 15:01.264
Had I let 'em, they...
They'd have never stopped.

15:01.265 --> 15:03.102
Everyone here knows that.

15:04.102 --> 15:06.737
We know what it takes
to build something...

15:06.738 --> 15:10.474
and how little recognition
you get from the outside world.

15:10.475 --> 15:12.542
You deserve more.

15:12.543 --> 15:16.279
You deserve to hear what each of
us heard when we arrived here...

15:16.280 --> 15:20.020
Well done, Dagny.
Well done.

15:23.020 --> 15:26.724
<i>While the government was busy passing
the Metal Unification Act...</i>

15:26.725 --> 15:29.826
<i>to try and solve the steel shortage
through greater regulation,</i>

15:29.827 --> 15:33.630
<i>Ragnar Danneskold sunk several
more ships carrying copper,</i>

15:33.631 --> 15:36.804
<i>resulting in more frequent
electrical outages.</i>

15:40.804 --> 15:43.105
<i>Dagny, I want you to stay
for one month...</i>

15:43.106 --> 15:48.646
just to see it all for yourself, and at
the end, you can choose to stay or go.

15:48.647 --> 15:52.316
But while you're here,
you gotta follow our rules.

15:52.317 --> 15:57.553
Our first rule is that no one provides
unearned sustenance for another person.

15:57.554 --> 15:59.190
I'll pay my own way.

15:59.191 --> 16:00.747
I doubt it.
You're penniless.

16:01.025 --> 16:04.025
What? Well, your money
has no value here.

16:04.696 --> 16:07.130
What do you mean?

16:07.131 --> 16:10.734
Well, here in the Gulch,
we deal in gold.

16:10.735 --> 16:12.304
I see.

16:13.304 --> 16:15.973
Then I'll earn my keep.

16:15.974 --> 16:19.076
How?
Hire me.

16:19.077 --> 16:22.979
I'll cook, clean, do laundry in
exchange for room and board...

16:22.980 --> 16:26.484
and a little money for something
to wear other than this.

16:26.485 --> 16:30.724
You... You really want
to do that?

16:32.724 --> 16:34.495
Yes.

16:37.495 --> 16:38.896
Then you're hired.

16:38.897 --> 16:40.000
Here.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.767
An advance.

16:43.768 --> 16:45.268
Where did you get these?

16:45.269 --> 16:47.182
The Mulligan bank.

17:31.182 --> 17:32.557
Whose house is that?

17:38.557 --> 17:40.990
Francisco.

17:40.991 --> 17:42.261
He was the first.

17:44.261 --> 17:48.798
So he destroyed his reputation and the
family's copper mines for the strike?

17:48.799 --> 17:51.501
That's not all he gave up.

17:51.502 --> 17:54.904
You know that he and I
were very close at one time.

17:54.905 --> 17:57.341
I do.

17:57.342 --> 17:59.110
What did he tell you?

17:59.111 --> 18:02.249
Nothing in particular,
but with his tone?

18:04.249 --> 18:06.121
Everything.

18:09.121 --> 18:11.089
They'll be happy to see you.

18:45.089 --> 18:47.591
Ragnar Danneskold?

18:47.592 --> 18:50.427
Dagny Taggart.
Have you joined us?

18:50.428 --> 18:52.962
No, I haven't.
I'm, -

18:52.963 --> 18:55.332
A scab?

18:55.333 --> 18:58.868
I crashed the gate.
Literally.

18:58.869 --> 19:00.336
So you are a scab.

19:00.337 --> 19:02.806
And you're a pirate.

19:02.807 --> 19:04.408
Right?

19:04.409 --> 19:09.113
I, have been accused
of making the seas unsafe.

19:09.114 --> 19:10.980
But only for those ships
carrying goods...

19:10.981 --> 19:13.650
taken by government force
from the rightful owners.

19:13.651 --> 19:15.451
I'm just returning
what's been stolen.

19:15.452 --> 19:20.193
Now, if that makes me
a pirate... well, so be it.

19:22.193 --> 19:24.127
See you around.

19:24.128 --> 19:26.040
I'm sure.

19:37.040 --> 19:40.277
- Hi, Miss Taggart.
- Oh. Hello.

19:40.278 --> 19:42.212
So they're not in school?

19:42.213 --> 19:43.815
Oh, no. I'm homeschooling them.
Oh.

19:44.015 --> 19:46.975
I joined the strike because I wouldn't
put them in an educational system...

19:47.050 --> 19:48.751
that doesn't
teach them to think.

19:48.752 --> 19:51.220
I guess they have some great role
models around here, don't they?

19:51.221 --> 19:53.289
Oh, yeah. They do.
And they're very happy.

19:53.290 --> 19:54.659
Oh.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.660
Have a great day.
Thank you.

19:58.730 --> 19:59.963
Thanks.

20:02.599 --> 20:05.302
<i>As the 100th anniversary
of Taggart Bridge,</i>

20:05.303 --> 20:07.238
<i>America's most important
railroad overpass,</i>

20:07.239 --> 20:09.507
<i>came and went
with little fanfare,</i>

20:09.508 --> 20:12.543
<i>Jim Taggart continued to
intentionally mislead the public,</i>

20:12.544 --> 20:14.143
<i>announcing that
the copper wire shortage...</i>

20:14.144 --> 20:18.714
<i>would not necessarily affect
transporting Minnesota's wheat.</i>

20:18.715 --> 20:20.983
<i>He also announced
that Dagny had died,</i>

20:20.984 --> 20:24.290
<i>and that her absence would not
affect railroad operations.</i>

20:26.290 --> 20:29.028
Gentlemen, science belongs
to the people,

20:30.028 --> 20:32.862
not a single individual
just because he invented it.

20:46.810 --> 20:49.078
Every man on the face
of the globe...

20:49.079 --> 20:54.151
has the right to share in the advantages
created by technological progress.

20:54.152 --> 20:58.057
It is vitally important that we
maintain a positive public opinion.

20:59.057 --> 21:02.992
We can't allow criticism of
the project at this time.

21:02.993 --> 21:06.497
Gentlemen, we should all be very
proud to usher in this new era.

21:06.498 --> 21:10.968
These new instruments of peace will
protect us from any and all aggressors.

21:10.969 --> 21:14.970
Project F will allow us to keep order
in the streets and protect the public.

21:14.971 --> 21:16.373
Mr. Thompson...

21:16.374 --> 21:20.509
Jimmy. Sorry to hear about the
loss of your sister Dagny.

21:20.510 --> 21:22.212
She'll be sorely missed.

21:22.213 --> 21:25.315
Thank you.
I just want you to know...

21:25.316 --> 21:29.854
that we really need the Railroad Unification
Act to save our transportation system.

21:30.054 --> 21:33.289
All for one, one for all.
I mean, that's the key here.

21:33.290 --> 21:35.258
Getting things going.

21:35.259 --> 21:39.563
In fact, we've appointed Cuffy
Meigs to direct the initiative.

21:39.564 --> 21:41.231
For the public good.

21:41.232 --> 21:43.769
Absolutely.

21:45.769 --> 21:48.769
We need to make sure the
speech is on all the networks.

21:54.879 --> 21:57.213
In a lot of ways,
this valley represents...

21:57.214 --> 21:59.716
what your great grandfather,
Nat, saw in our country...

21:59.717 --> 22:04.320
Unbridled opportunity, where
innovation is rewarded.

22:04.321 --> 22:07.324
You see, he built the Taggart
Bridge over the Mississippi...

22:07.325 --> 22:10.827
and connected
an entire nation by rail.

22:10.828 --> 22:14.698
When the courts tried to stop
him, he fought and he prevailed.

22:14.699 --> 22:16.499
That bridge
is still standing today.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.701
True. True,
but as the country prospered,

22:18.702 --> 22:22.605
the people gave the government
more and more power.

22:22.606 --> 22:26.876
Those in charge saw successful businessmen
as a threat to their control,

22:26.877 --> 22:30.814
so they simply took what was created
in the name of the public good.

22:30.815 --> 22:33.249
So you convinced the others
to strike.

22:33.250 --> 22:34.951
Each one was invited here.

22:34.952 --> 22:39.659
You... You're the first person to
come to this valley by accident.

22:40.659 --> 22:43.126
If you choose to stay,

22:43.127 --> 22:46.429
you'll have to join us in what
we are trying to accomplish.

22:46.430 --> 22:48.542
You have
an important decision to make.

22:51.035 --> 22:53.813
But I love the railroad
my great grandfather built.

22:57.241 --> 22:59.548
Good night.

23:03.502 --> 23:05.614
Was it as difficult
for all the others?

23:05.615 --> 23:07.317
The first night was.

23:07.318 --> 23:08.885
Is this the room
where they arrive?

23:08.886 --> 23:11.124
I never intended you
to occupy this room.

23:13.124 --> 23:14.952
Good night.

23:41.952 --> 23:44.554
<i>Francisco D'Anconia's
copper mines,</i>

23:44.555 --> 23:46.757
<i>the world's
largest remaining mines,</i>

23:46.758 --> 23:49.394
<i>were closed due to a series
of explosions.</i>

23:51.394 --> 23:55.443
<i>No workers were injured, but
no new copper was available.</i>

24:13.518 --> 24:15.419
Francisco.

24:15.420 --> 24:17.387
You're two days late.
What happened?

24:17.388 --> 24:19.723
Sorry I'm late, John. Come in.
I'll get you a drink.

24:19.923 --> 24:23.727
But listen, I came to tell you
that I won't be long.

24:23.728 --> 24:25.728
Francisco.
I'm concerned...

24:26.832 --> 24:29.332
Dagny. It's like I can't
believe you're alive!

24:29.333 --> 24:30.333
Oh.

24:32.069 --> 24:33.571
And you're here.

24:34.571 --> 24:37.207
Now you know everything.

24:37.208 --> 24:39.276
Now you understand why.

24:39.277 --> 24:43.444
Frisco, you should know... I'm here by
accident. I'm not part of the strike.

24:44.382 --> 24:45.549
How did you get here?

24:46.049 --> 24:48.418
It's a long story.

24:48.419 --> 24:50.487
The main thing
is that you are safe.

24:50.488 --> 24:51.887
He's right.

24:51.888 --> 24:53.888
I'll come by later.
All right then.

24:56.082 --> 24:58.194
And I want to spend
some time with you.

24:58.195 --> 24:59.465
Me too.

25:01.465 --> 25:03.300
I'll stop by.
Bye, John.

25:03.301 --> 25:04.601
Welcome back.

25:04.602 --> 25:08.207
I'm going to stop by the power
plant to check the output levels.

25:09.207 --> 25:10.973
Power plant?

25:10.974 --> 25:12.974
Yes.

25:16.180 --> 25:17.189
Come on.

25:58.189 --> 26:01.223
The motor generates enough
power for the entire valley.

26:01.224 --> 26:04.395
In fact, it could power
the entire West Coast.

26:05.395 --> 26:07.463
How?

26:07.464 --> 26:10.600
It converts atmospheric
electricity into energy...

26:10.601 --> 26:12.651
at virtually no cost.

26:27.651 --> 26:29.651
Is this it?
Yes.

26:29.921 --> 26:33.556
I can't believe this powers
the entire valley.

26:33.557 --> 26:37.294
No amount of force will grant
you access to that motor.

26:37.295 --> 26:39.163
Allow me.

26:40.163 --> 26:42.932
I swear by my life
and my love of it...

26:42.933 --> 26:45.567
that I will never live
for the sake of another man...

26:45.568 --> 26:47.872
nor ask another man
to live for mine.

26:57.714 --> 26:59.852
Not yet.

27:01.852 --> 27:05.555
Everyone has taken that oath
who lives in this valley.

27:05.556 --> 27:07.457
Everyone except you.

27:07.458 --> 27:09.192
Well, that's what I do.

27:09.193 --> 27:10.861
I live for myself,
not for others,

27:11.061 --> 27:14.364
just, unlike you, I don't believe
in abandoning the fight.

27:14.365 --> 27:19.602
Well, we're going to have to see
which one of us is wrong.

27:19.603 --> 27:22.971
Until then, I know you won't say
those words until you mean them...

27:22.972 --> 27:25.919
the way they're intended.

29:12.849 --> 29:16.519
I still don't understand why
you don't use mules, Francisco.

29:16.520 --> 29:19.221
Mules, John? These animals
are not so friendly.

29:19.222 --> 29:21.124
They're just as stubborn
as women.

29:21.125 --> 29:23.692
Frisco, you are wasting an
unconscionable amount of time...

29:23.693 --> 29:25.295
bringing your copper ore
up this way.

29:25.296 --> 29:27.930
You ought to build a rail
line down to the smelter.

29:27.931 --> 29:30.066
I know, but it's
such a difficult job.

29:30.067 --> 29:32.803
Besides, the mine's output
doesn't justify the expense.

29:33.003 --> 29:34.872
That's nonsense. You see
that pass to the east?

29:34.873 --> 29:37.590
Huh. It's an easier grade
with softer stone.

29:37.591 --> 29:39.241
It wouldn't take
a lot of curves.

29:39.242 --> 29:42.845
Maybe three miles of rail,
narrow gauge.

29:42.846 --> 29:44.381
- You have a pen and paper?
- Here.

29:44.382 --> 29:46.482
It'll pay for itself
in three years.

29:46.483 --> 29:50.287
Here. Look. I might have to blast a
tunnel here, a few hundred feet or less,

29:50.288 --> 29:54.624
and I'd need a steel trestle to
bring the track across this gorge.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.460
We'd bring it down here.

29:56.461 --> 30:00.530
It's not that difficult, and it would cut
off that last mile of corkscrew turns.

30:00.531 --> 30:03.836
I could have the track laid
in three months.

30:05.836 --> 30:08.372
Oh, what for?

30:08.373 --> 30:10.839
Abandon an entire
transcontinental system...

30:10.840 --> 30:12.976
to build
three miles of railroad.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.755
If you change your mind,
I'll hire you on the spot.

30:16.371 --> 30:19.149
Or Midas can give you a loan
if you want to own it.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.918
No, I can't.
Not yet.

30:21.919 --> 30:25.588
I wish I could just stay here and never know
what my brother is doing to the railroad.

30:25.589 --> 30:28.029
Well, you would hear about it...
every wreck, every explosion,

30:28.058 --> 30:29.660
every broken line.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.863
And eventually, the collapse
of the Taggart Bridge.

30:32.864 --> 30:34.396
That's not going to happen.

30:34.397 --> 30:37.135
Dagny, nobody stays here
by faking reality.

30:39.135 --> 30:41.104
Well, I'll get back
to my job then.

30:41.105 --> 30:44.251
Enjoy your last week, Dagny.

30:54.251 --> 30:56.553
Here's a question for you...

30:56.554 --> 31:01.391
If Taggart Transcontinental
were your own company,

31:01.392 --> 31:03.526
would you hire your brother Jim?

31:03.527 --> 31:06.864
Good God, no. No, I wouldn't
hire him as a track worker.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.831
I mean, he's... he's
completely incompetent.

31:08.832 --> 31:13.972
Then why do Jim and all of his
cronies have so much power?

31:15.972 --> 31:17.575
Why do they?

31:20.111 --> 31:24.514
Because they promote
the idea that it's okay...

31:24.515 --> 31:27.549
to take from one man,
give to another.

31:27.550 --> 31:31.320
Dagny, all of your life,
you've heard people saying...

31:31.321 --> 31:35.191
that we have to help
the less fortunate,

31:35.192 --> 31:37.727
that the measure of virtue is...

31:37.728 --> 31:41.331
Is not what you achieve,
but what you do for others.

31:41.332 --> 31:43.055
You... You've heard them say...

31:44.000 --> 31:48.770
that people have a right to a
living just because they're human.

31:48.771 --> 31:52.075
And that's not the right to earn a
living, that is a right <i> to</i> a living,

31:52.076 --> 31:55.314
which you are required
to provide for them.

31:56.314 --> 32:00.216
Now, do you see
any common themes here?

32:00.217 --> 32:03.953
Need of others paramount,
your needs secondary?

32:03.954 --> 32:08.658
Their philosophy is based on how
much you sacrifice to other people,

32:08.659 --> 32:11.329
not on what you achieve.

32:12.329 --> 32:15.198
That philosophy can't work.

32:15.199 --> 32:19.903
Unless you continue to work
and work and work and work...

32:19.904 --> 32:23.972
and try to overcome all the obstacles
which they have created for you.

32:23.973 --> 32:26.476
And no matter how much
they take from you,

32:26.477 --> 32:29.912
they still count on your
work ethic, your integrity,

32:29.913 --> 32:33.318
your desire to keep producing.

32:35.318 --> 32:37.120
But I... I love what I do.

32:37.121 --> 32:40.989
No, I know.
Yeah. So did John.

32:40.990 --> 32:44.260
Yeah. But he refused
to accept their ideas.

32:44.261 --> 32:49.132
He refused to put
his ability... his motor...

32:49.133 --> 32:51.400
At their disposal.

32:51.401 --> 32:53.536
As long as you continue
to accept it,

32:53.537 --> 32:58.511
they will continue to exploit
your extraordinary abilities.

33:01.511 --> 33:04.213
<i>While Thompson and his cronies
were holed up...</i>

33:04.214 --> 33:06.450
<i>in the Wayne-Falkland Hotel
in New York,</i>

33:06.451 --> 33:09.485
<i>preparing for his big speech
on November 23,</i>

33:09.486 --> 33:13.001
<i>Henry Rearden continued
his search for Dagny Taggart.</i>

33:29.840 --> 33:34.210
John, that's Hank Rearden, one
man you have yet to bring here...

33:34.211 --> 33:36.481
One you wanted for some time.

33:38.481 --> 33:41.383
Maybe Francisco
can convince him.

33:41.384 --> 33:43.565
Maybe.

33:54.565 --> 33:57.200
So, how was the lecture tonight?

33:57.201 --> 33:58.272
Well...

34:02.272 --> 34:04.042
John, what is it?

34:06.042 --> 34:08.277
You've got something
on your mind.

34:08.279 --> 34:10.150
I know you too well, my friend.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.554
Of all of us here,

34:16.554 --> 34:19.797
I know that you're the one
who's given up the most.

34:26.797 --> 34:29.668
I'll be all right, John.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.815
It's time to get Hank.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.585
We're out of chocolate cake.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.317
Oh, you scared me.

34:49.318 --> 34:51.553
What are you doing?

34:51.554 --> 34:54.790
Well, I told you.
I've been watching you.

34:54.791 --> 34:56.259
I couldn't sleep.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.529
My mind's racing. You?

34:59.530 --> 35:01.541
Well, I have a stranger
in my house.

35:10.541 --> 35:12.341
When's the first time
you saw me?

35:12.342 --> 35:14.347
I remember that well.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.381
<i>You were standing on
the Taggart passenger platform.</i>

35:18.382 --> 35:20.383
<i>You were wearing
an evening gown and a shawl,</i>

35:20.384 --> 35:22.451
<i>and if your shawl
had slipped any further down,</i>

35:22.452 --> 35:25.721
you'd have been
standing there naked.

35:25.722 --> 35:27.290
And you belonged there.

35:27.291 --> 35:32.194
Not in some silk-curtained
sitting room, but there.

35:32.195 --> 35:34.534
Among the rails.

35:38.203 --> 35:40.870
Did you see that plane
circling the valley today?

35:40.871 --> 35:42.738
Yes.

35:42.739 --> 35:44.043
That was Hank Rearden.

35:46.043 --> 35:48.289
He's a good man.

35:59.289 --> 36:02.512
<i>Anticipating greater unrest,
the State Science Institute...</i>

36:03.059 --> 36:07.230
<i>began developing crude, but
lethal, crowd-control devices.</i>

36:07.231 --> 36:08.897
<i>As the Unification Board...</i>

36:08.898 --> 36:12.768
<i>remained incapable of clearing the
rockslide blocking the Taggart Tunnel,</i>

36:12.769 --> 36:15.576
<i>cross-country transportation
was now crippled.</i>

36:18.576 --> 36:20.114
So, Dagny...

36:23.114 --> 36:25.381
Have you made your decision?

36:25.382 --> 36:28.052
I think so.

36:29.052 --> 36:31.421
But I'm not sure.

36:31.422 --> 36:34.256
And it's too important
not to be completely certain.

36:34.979 --> 36:36.591
If any of your uncertainty...

36:36.592 --> 36:40.696
is a conflict between
your heart and your mind,

36:40.697 --> 36:42.363
follow your mind.

36:42.364 --> 36:44.476
That wasn't the advice
I was expecting.

36:46.268 --> 36:48.705
Let it go until it's time.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.540
We still have you
with us tonight.

36:52.208 --> 36:56.111
Francisco, you'll be back
in a few months.

36:56.112 --> 36:57.712
November at the latest.

36:57.713 --> 37:00.817
And, John, you're not returning
to New York this time, are you?

37:00.818 --> 37:02.785
I haven't decided yet.

37:02.786 --> 37:05.288
You're not thinking about going
back to that hell, are you?

37:05.289 --> 37:06.922
I am.

37:06.923 --> 37:08.624
But, John, why?

37:08.625 --> 37:12.361
Well, I'll tell you
once I've decided.

37:12.362 --> 37:13.830
But everyone's here except Hank,

37:14.030 --> 37:15.464
and he'll be here soon enough.

37:15.465 --> 37:17.299
And Dagny, if she chooses.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.980
Your job is done. There's nothing
more for you to look for out there.

37:20.003 --> 37:21.904
I know.

37:21.905 --> 37:24.906
When the rails are nationalized,
everything will collapse.

37:24.907 --> 37:26.776
Why risk it?

37:26.777 --> 37:29.712
They are getting serious
about the disappearances.

37:29.713 --> 37:33.158
They suspect something. You, of
all people, shouldn't be there.

37:34.028 --> 37:35.917
The infrastructure's
falling apart.

37:35.918 --> 37:39.589
Just the physical risk of complex
machinery in the hands of blind fools...

37:39.590 --> 37:41.890
You'll be taking a chance
every time you step on a train.

37:41.891 --> 37:43.892
There's been one collision
after another.

37:43.893 --> 37:47.129
Not to mention the weapons the SSI have
been testing to maintain the peace,

37:47.130 --> 37:48.698
as they say.

37:48.699 --> 37:51.336
If I go back,
it won't be for the strike.

37:53.336 --> 37:56.376
It'll be to get the only thing
I want for myself.

37:59.376 --> 38:00.821
There's going to be riots.

38:02.144 --> 38:03.879
Electricity's being rationed.

38:03.880 --> 38:06.482
Food supply chains
are being severed.

38:06.483 --> 38:10.352
In no time at all, there'll be one train
a week, and then one train a month,

38:10.353 --> 38:11.854
and then the Taggart Bridge
will collapse.

38:11.855 --> 38:13.063
No.

38:20.063 --> 38:22.599
No. That won't happen.

38:23.544 --> 38:25.267
Then you've made your decision.

38:25.268 --> 38:27.169
I have.

38:27.170 --> 38:31.073
As long as I am alive, I will not
desert a battle that is mine to fight.

38:31.074 --> 38:33.709
You'll be back, Dagny.

38:33.710 --> 38:35.947
And we'll be here
waiting for you.

38:36.547 --> 38:39.348
We need to discuss the
conditions of your departure.

38:39.349 --> 38:42.451
First, you have to give us your word that you
won't disclose anything about this valley.

38:42.452 --> 38:44.819
You can't reveal
our... our cause,

38:44.820 --> 38:47.957
our existence, your whereabouts
for the past month,

38:47.958 --> 38:49.347
to anyone for any reason.

38:50.293 --> 38:51.861
I give you my word.

38:51.862 --> 38:55.452
Second, you never attempt
to come back uninvited again.

39:15.452 --> 39:18.120
Have you decided?

39:18.121 --> 39:19.496
Are you going back?

39:28.864 --> 39:30.702
Yes.

39:31.469 --> 39:33.803
But Frisco said it's
too dangerous for you.

39:34.003 --> 39:35.638
I don't want you to go.

39:35.639 --> 39:37.473
It's not up to you.

39:37.474 --> 39:39.875
You're going for my sake.

39:39.876 --> 39:41.045
No, for mine.

39:43.045 --> 39:44.981
Will we see each other?

39:45.981 --> 39:47.482
No.

39:47.483 --> 39:50.185
Will you be watching me?

39:50.186 --> 39:51.819
More so.

39:51.820 --> 39:53.888
Why?

39:53.889 --> 39:56.759
To be there the day
you decide to join us.

39:56.760 --> 40:00.596
What if I told you
I will never join you?

40:00.597 --> 40:03.533
That would be a lie.
John, the risk.

40:03.534 --> 40:07.069
I wouldn't do it if I had
no selfish end to gain.

40:07.070 --> 40:08.077
What selfish end?

40:14.077 --> 40:15.251
I want you here.

40:55.251 --> 40:58.090
I need to make sure you
can't find your way back.

42:07.090 --> 42:09.393
You'll find
a Taggart station in town.

42:10.393 --> 42:11.393
Don't look for me.

42:12.028 --> 42:16.155
When you need me, I'll be the
easiest man in the world to find.

43:13.155 --> 43:14.155
Hank.
<i>Dagny?</i>

43:14.791 --> 43:16.392
I'm so sorry.

43:16.393 --> 43:18.426
<i>It's okay.
You don't need to apologize.</i>

43:18.427 --> 43:20.229
<i>There's something
I have to tell you.</i>

43:20.230 --> 43:22.296
<i>I'm just happy
to hear your voice,</i>

43:22.297 --> 43:24.433
<i>to know you're all right.</i>

43:24.434 --> 43:27.102
<i>What we had together is a
memory I will always cherish.</i>

43:27.103 --> 43:29.103
<i>I'm so sorry, Hank.
I'm happy, Dagny.</i>

43:29.706 --> 43:32.441
<i>I've got to run.
Frisco is waiting.</i>

43:32.442 --> 43:34.709
<i>We'll see each other soon.</i>

43:34.710 --> 43:36.315
<i>Who is John Galt?</i>

43:39.915 --> 43:41.995
<i>Jim Taggart scheduled
a press conference...</i>

43:42.018 --> 43:45.687
<i>announcing the sudden return of
his sister Dagny to New York.</i>

43:45.688 --> 43:48.758
<i>Meanwhile, several Rearden
steelworkers died defending a mill...</i>

43:48.759 --> 43:52.204
<i>against a violent takeover by
government-sponsored union thugs.</i>

43:53.919 --> 43:56.531
<i>At the same time,
the diverted Taggart trains...</i>

43:56.532 --> 44:00.255
<i>stopped transporting badly needed
Minnesota wheat to the East Coast.</i>

44:10.438 --> 44:14.716
I'm not accustomed to being dragged away
from the SSI without rhyme or reason.

44:14.717 --> 44:17.085
Dr. Stadler. Precisely.

44:17.086 --> 44:19.824
Which makes me appreciate you
all the more.

44:20.824 --> 44:22.625
Why am I here?

44:22.626 --> 44:26.465
Walk with me. I have another
meeting in five minutes.

44:29.065 --> 44:33.768
Dr. Stadler, more than ever, the government
needs to present a strong, unified front...

44:33.769 --> 44:36.372
to bolster the confidence
of the people.

44:36.373 --> 44:38.841
The head of state has
a grand vision for the future.

44:39.041 --> 44:42.810
And he expects the full support
of the State Science Institute,

44:42.811 --> 44:45.580
namely your full support
on our current project.

44:45.581 --> 44:48.484
My full support for what?

44:48.485 --> 44:50.151
You'll get the specifics later.

44:50.152 --> 44:52.721
Now listen carefully, Doctor.

44:52.722 --> 44:55.624
What I'm about to share with
you is highly confidential...

44:55.625 --> 44:58.331
and crucial
to the nation's welfare.

45:01.331 --> 45:03.240
"Project F"?

45:11.240 --> 45:15.812
Why, this looks like
an instrument of torture.

45:15.813 --> 45:17.879
Why wasn't I told about this?

45:17.880 --> 45:22.484
How dare you use my research to
create this... this... this weapon?

45:22.485 --> 45:26.221
I didn't spend eight years to see
my research turned into this.

45:26.222 --> 45:28.445
I mean, I have...
Your signature, Doctor.

45:29.025 --> 45:30.725
The public needs to know...

45:30.726 --> 45:34.663
the tax money spent on SSI
research serves the public.

45:34.664 --> 45:39.968
I founded the SSI to expand
the frontiers of knowledge.

45:39.969 --> 45:43.372
This is not the time
for impractical idealism.

45:43.373 --> 45:48.176
The motive for Project F
is not up for discussion.

45:48.177 --> 45:51.680
Consider yourself informed,
Doctor.

45:51.681 --> 45:54.683
What if I don't want
to give my support?

45:54.684 --> 45:58.257
What if I don't agree with
this... this abomination?

46:00.257 --> 46:01.965
Well, then.

46:42.965 --> 46:44.500
<i>...all operations.</i>

46:44.501 --> 46:46.468
<i>In other news,
Head of State Thompson said...</i>

46:46.469 --> 46:49.705
<i>there is no national problem
with aviation safety...</i>

46:49.706 --> 46:55.743
<i>despite yesterday's Amalgamated Airlines
crash which killed 35 passengers.</i>

46:55.744 --> 46:57.717
Just do it, Eddie.

47:00.717 --> 47:04.293
You've been Dagny's right-hand man
for years, so take care of it.

47:10.293 --> 47:13.293
Dagny...
I'll be with you in a minute.

47:13.630 --> 47:17.399
Just cancel the Comet for the
schedule for tomorrow and Tuesday.

47:17.400 --> 47:20.512
Fire the engines to Arizona
for the grapefruit special...

47:21.036 --> 47:23.138
and send the orders out
immediately.

47:23.139 --> 47:24.806
You'll do nothing of the kind.

47:25.041 --> 47:28.782
Minnesota needs that line
to move the harvest.

47:32.782 --> 47:34.621
Send the orders.

47:37.621 --> 47:39.931
Excuse me.

47:48.931 --> 47:51.600
Thank God.

47:51.601 --> 47:54.470
Dagny, I thought that... You're
not sending any orders.

47:54.471 --> 47:56.939
But Washington sent him here to
oversee the Railroad Unification Act.

47:56.940 --> 47:59.607
Washington doesn't run
this railroad. I do.

47:59.608 --> 48:00.709
Dagny.

48:00.710 --> 48:02.276
I, -
Jim.

48:02.277 --> 48:04.312
Heard the good news you're okay.

48:04.313 --> 48:05.980
I'm, -

48:05.981 --> 48:09.484
I'm glad you're back. Alive.

48:09.485 --> 48:12.288
There are some urgent... the
most urgent thing now is...

48:12.289 --> 48:15.191
for you to go to the press
and tell them you didn't quit.

48:15.192 --> 48:17.592
I'm not doing any press. No, you have to.
They've been all...

48:17.693 --> 48:21.428
I'm not going to reassure the public
about the state of our industry, Jim.

48:21.429 --> 48:23.864
What is this
Railroad Unification Act?

48:23.865 --> 48:29.904
Well, it's a new national setup that went
into effect about three weeks ago...

48:29.905 --> 48:32.707
which you will approve of and
appreciate and find extremely good...

48:32.708 --> 48:34.375
for Taggart Transcontinental.

48:34.376 --> 48:35.810
What is it?

48:35.811 --> 48:39.814
You are aware we are in
an emergency situation, right?

48:39.815 --> 48:43.752
The country's top priority is to
preserve the transportation industry.

48:43.753 --> 48:45.221
The national
survival requires...

48:45.222 --> 48:47.689
What is the plan?
What does it do?

48:47.690 --> 48:51.862
Every railroad in the country has
been unified into a single team.

48:52.862 --> 48:54.367
Pooling their resources.

48:58.367 --> 49:00.502
You've nationalized
the railroad.

49:00.503 --> 49:01.970
No skin off your back.

49:01.971 --> 49:03.839
Cuffy.
Cuffy, please.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.374
Dagny, under the act,

49:05.375 --> 49:08.643
all of the gross revenue
will be turned over...

49:08.644 --> 49:11.178
to the Railroad Pool Board
in Washington...

49:11.179 --> 49:14.818
where it will then be distributed on a
more modern principle of distribution...

49:15.018 --> 49:16.118
What principle?

49:16.119 --> 49:18.319
You know...
You know, we're fine.

49:18.320 --> 49:20.522
This is good for business.

49:20.523 --> 49:23.125
You know, we're doing...
We're doing great.

49:23.126 --> 49:25.070
We'll finish this later.

49:37.039 --> 49:40.543
Are you seein' what
I'm seein' up there, boss?

49:41.543 --> 49:43.946
The electrical wire's
been compromised.

49:43.947 --> 49:45.947
<i>Switches are out.</i>
It's not my fault!

49:45.948 --> 49:48.255
Look, you're on your own.

50:00.463 --> 50:02.463
Operations.
<i>Is this Eddie Willers?</i>

50:02.864 --> 50:06.835
Hey, it's not my place to tell
you, but nobody else will.

50:06.836 --> 50:09.770
- We're about to have a disaster on our hands.
- Who is this?

50:09.771 --> 50:12.874
I'm a lineman in your California division.
Let's leave it at that.

50:12.875 --> 50:15.176
<i>They tell me it's orders
from the Unification Board...</i>

50:15.177 --> 50:16.678
<i>and to mind
my own damn business.</i>

50:16.679 --> 50:18.719
<i>What's your name?</i> It doesn't matter.
I'm outta here.

50:18.847 --> 50:20.549
<i>Good luck.</i>

50:20.550 --> 50:22.255
Wait!

50:27.255 --> 50:30.859
<i>Thompson's PR people were heavily
promoting his big speech,</i>

50:30.860 --> 50:34.335
<i>predicting it would be the
most-watched broadcast in history.</i>

50:40.105 --> 50:44.439
You tell that little con artist I've
already got the rail offsets fast-tracked.

50:44.440 --> 50:46.107
I just...

50:46.108 --> 50:48.509
It is a complete disaster, Jim.

50:48.510 --> 50:50.444
What are you talking about?
What disaster?

50:50.445 --> 50:52.680
Your Railroad Unification Plan.

50:52.681 --> 50:54.716
- We're going over a cliff.
- What?

50:54.717 --> 50:56.685
The board has hijacked
all our rolling stock.

50:56.686 --> 50:58.754
The harvests are rotting
in Minnesota.

50:58.755 --> 51:01.723
And we don't have the copper wire
we need to keep the lines running.

51:01.724 --> 51:03.357
That's not true.

51:03.358 --> 51:05.827
They prioritize the projects
vital to public welfare.

51:06.027 --> 51:07.662
Some will just have to
wait their turn.

51:07.663 --> 51:10.397
Well, you tell that to the family
that's about to run out of food.

51:10.398 --> 51:12.067
No, no. Don't...
Don't be so dramatic.

51:12.068 --> 51:14.403
Dramatic?
What are you thinking?

51:14.404 --> 51:16.939
We are the last railroad
that can move the harvests.

51:16.940 --> 51:20.174
If we don't get trains out there, the
East Coast will run out of food.

51:20.175 --> 51:23.111
So what do you wanna do about it?
You're the problem solver around here.

51:23.112 --> 51:24.814
Yeah, I am.

51:24.815 --> 51:27.649
And what if I woke up one day
and just said,

51:27.650 --> 51:29.951
"I'm not gonna find
a way today"?

51:29.952 --> 51:31.419
What if I just left?

51:31.420 --> 51:33.654
Hell, you've been gone for a
month doing who knows what.

51:33.655 --> 51:36.725
Who do you think has been taking
care of business around here?

51:36.726 --> 51:38.099
No one.

52:07.290 --> 52:10.225
Yeah. I need you to check this
one again, Eddie. Will you?

52:10.226 --> 52:12.226
I'm on it.
Thank you.

52:12.426 --> 52:14.663
What is it? Did they
release the rolling stock?

52:14.664 --> 52:17.399
There's a very important dinner
tomorrow night at the Wayne-Falkland.

52:17.400 --> 52:19.100
I promised the boys
that you'd be there.

52:19.101 --> 52:21.669
Seriously, Jim. A dinner? Do you
have any idea what's going on here?

52:21.670 --> 52:23.673
Thompson's inner circle
will be there. Why?

52:23.873 --> 52:25.941
We're gonna talk about
shipping the harvests.

52:25.942 --> 52:27.908
You want to be in on
that decision, don't you?

52:27.909 --> 52:30.312
They're gonna decide how to
save the harvest at a dinner?

52:30.313 --> 52:33.214
If you really want to help your
farmer friends, now's your chance.

52:33.215 --> 52:35.149
Friends?
They're our customers, Jim.

52:35.150 --> 52:37.453
Listen, it's formal,
but don't overdo it.

52:37.454 --> 52:39.923
It would please them.

52:40.923 --> 52:42.701
Tell me you're joking.

52:51.701 --> 52:54.803
Nobody, not even Dagny Taggart,

52:54.804 --> 52:57.638
will deny that there are times
when it's necessary...

52:57.639 --> 53:01.509
to sacrifice the parts
for the sake of the whole.

53:01.510 --> 53:04.750
What parts are we talking about, Mr.
Meigs?

53:06.750 --> 53:09.786
Well, the sickly parts,
of course.

53:10.786 --> 53:12.921
Like Minnesota.

53:12.922 --> 53:15.424
They have to be sacrificed
in order to save the whole...

53:15.425 --> 53:18.859
The entire system.

53:18.860 --> 53:20.895
Sacrifice Minnesota?

53:20.896 --> 53:22.497
Well, yes.

53:22.498 --> 53:24.765
We have to keep cross-country
routing intact...

53:24.766 --> 53:27.067
in case we need to move
troops between states.

53:27.068 --> 53:30.238
You understand. Balance
peacekeeping with the recovery.

53:30.239 --> 53:32.009
To keep order.

53:34.009 --> 53:37.979
You cut off Minnesota,
you cut off the supply of wheat.

53:37.980 --> 53:41.018
You might be able to
sacrifice an arm or a leg,

53:42.018 --> 53:46.921
but you cannot save a body by
sacrificing its heart or its brain.

53:46.922 --> 53:48.790
Well, we're depending upon...

53:48.791 --> 53:53.294
the local farmers in the
Northeast to pick up the slack.

53:53.295 --> 53:56.131
We're counting on it.

53:56.132 --> 54:00.201
There aren't enough local farmers
to feed a population that size.

54:00.202 --> 54:02.337
You know, Miss Taggart,

54:02.338 --> 54:05.239
it's a great responsibility...

54:05.240 --> 54:08.408
to hold the decision
of life or death...

54:08.409 --> 54:10.578
over millions of people...

54:10.579 --> 54:13.251
Sacrifice thousands,
if necessary.

54:16.251 --> 54:18.690
But we must have
the courage to do so.

54:20.690 --> 54:24.628
We have to be practical,
scientific.

54:25.350 --> 54:27.628
Public welfare is one...
Pipe down, Jimmy.

54:27.629 --> 54:29.196
Of our biggest...

54:29.197 --> 54:32.366
Cuffy, there's trouble
in California.

54:32.367 --> 54:35.370
There's talk of seceding
from the union.

54:35.371 --> 54:37.205
Oregon's overrun by gangs.

54:37.206 --> 54:39.206
They've murdered
two tax collectors.

54:40.643 --> 54:41.643
Excuse me.

54:47.115 --> 54:49.317
Cuffy's right.

54:49.318 --> 54:51.319
Let's move the rail stock
from Minnesota.

54:51.320 --> 54:53.423
Eddie. What?

54:55.423 --> 54:57.094
How long ago?

54:59.094 --> 55:01.562
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

55:01.563 --> 55:03.131
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Dagny?

55:03.132 --> 55:06.299
- Da... Dagny, where are you going?
- Sit down, Jimmy boy.

55:10.405 --> 55:13.344
We're droppin' Minnesota.

55:53.648 --> 55:55.183
Jeff.
Miss Taggart.

55:55.184 --> 55:57.620
What's the matter? Switching
signals are dead.

55:57.820 --> 56:00.321
I got four inbound trains,
two outgoing, all frozen.

56:00.322 --> 56:02.424
I can't get 'em out
of the damn tunnels.

56:02.425 --> 56:04.359
We can't seem to find
the breach in the system.

56:04.360 --> 56:07.663
I'm telling you, Miss Taggart, there's just
no guidelines for this kind of emergency.

56:07.664 --> 56:09.333
I'll take care of it.

56:11.333 --> 56:13.868
Eddie, where's
the systems engineer?

56:13.869 --> 56:15.404
<i>Can't find him.</i>

56:15.405 --> 56:17.171
Call Chicago Southern.

56:17.172 --> 56:20.207
Tell them to get their systems guy
out of bed and get him down here.

56:20.208 --> 56:23.511
- Tell them I'll pay whatever it costs.
- <i>I'm on it.</i>

56:23.512 --> 56:25.212
We'll make
our own guidelines, Jeff.

56:25.213 --> 56:28.750
Get all of our nonadministrative
people out here... all of 'em.

56:28.751 --> 56:31.352
Section hands, track walkers,
whoever's in the terminal...

56:31.353 --> 56:33.455
- I want them here now.
- Here?

56:33.456 --> 56:37.926
I'm responsible. Get every source light
and lantern you can lay your hands on.

56:37.927 --> 56:40.828
Then get some red and green
cellophane and tape.

56:40.829 --> 56:42.829
Lanterns?
Lanterns. Get going.

56:43.029 --> 56:45.366
- Yes, ma'am.
- What are we doing here, Miss Taggart?

56:45.367 --> 56:47.367
We're going to move the trains.
How?

56:47.802 --> 56:52.140
By hand. I want you to put a man
with a light at each switch.

56:52.141 --> 56:55.141
That could take all night! And all day
tomorrow, if that's what it takes.

56:55.142 --> 56:57.198
But these trains will move.
Excuse me.

57:00.115 --> 57:03.417
Bring it in! Hey, hey.
Come on in, guys.

57:03.418 --> 57:05.418
Hey, listen up, guys!
Hey.

57:10.992 --> 57:12.426
I'm Dagny Taggart.

57:12.427 --> 57:15.964
The instructions you are about
to receive come from me.

57:15.965 --> 57:20.100
The men who issue them are
acting under my instructions.

57:20.101 --> 57:23.270
The tower director will assign
the switchmen to their posts.

57:23.271 --> 57:26.841
I count on each of you...

57:26.842 --> 57:29.384
to get the trains rolling
and to...

57:34.384 --> 57:36.820
Something wrong, Miss Taggart?

57:37.820 --> 57:39.754
Go ahead.
Assign the posts.

57:39.755 --> 57:41.755
Let's do this.
Let's go!

59:34.635 --> 59:36.909
Hey, I can see the signal!

59:39.909 --> 59:43.643
It's workin'!
It's actually workin'!

59:43.644 --> 59:45.096
Son of a gun.

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:02.231
Who's John Galt?

01:00:08.971 --> 01:00:11.305
<i>When the Rearden steel mills
fell silent...</i>

01:00:11.306 --> 01:00:12.741
<i>after Hank's disappearance,</i>

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:15.812
<i>the Unification Board called him
a greedy, selfish capitalist,</i>

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:19.948
<i>while Thompson promised to announce greater
reforms to get things back on track.</i>

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:22.149
<i>At the same time,
Cherryl Taggart, Jim's wife,</i>

01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:24.317
<i>learned she had married a fraud.</i>

01:00:24.318 --> 01:00:27.443
<i>Jim Taggart was not the man
she thought he was.</i>

01:00:51.346 --> 01:00:52.346
Floyd?
<i>Hey, Jimmy.</i>

01:00:52.546 --> 01:00:54.448
Yeah, I just read
the article about Cherryl.

01:00:54.449 --> 01:00:57.449
<i>Yeah, that's... No, that's not my fault.
</i> Right. Right.

01:00:57.719 --> 01:00:59.719
<i>I had nothing to do with it.
</i> Sure.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:01.043
<i>It's tragic. I just...</i>

01:01:02.023 --> 01:01:05.727
Say, your sister's gonna
help Thompson, right?

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:07.627
<i>Yeah. No, I'm gonna...
I mean, she is.</i>

01:01:07.628 --> 01:01:10.628
<i>I'm gonna get her to be on
stage with him.</i> All right.

01:01:10.629 --> 01:01:11.629
Yeah.

01:01:15.892 --> 01:01:17.837
<i>It's gonna help
the underprivileged.</i>

01:01:17.838 --> 01:01:19.339
That's something
you should know about.

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:21.542
You're always so damn
anxious to hide the fact...

01:01:21.543 --> 01:01:23.210
that you come from the slums.

01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:26.446
I'm a genius! I'm gonna have more money
than you could possibly imagine.

01:01:26.447 --> 01:01:30.118
More than those grubby mechanics,
Rearden and my sister.

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:34.888
Whatever they do, I can undo
just like that. Just like that!

01:01:34.889 --> 01:01:36.457
Like snapping a spine.

01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:39.127
Now you want to break spines?
Oh, God, I never said that.

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:41.095
You know I never said that.
That's not what I meant.

01:01:41.096 --> 01:01:42.596
What is... What's the
matter with you?

01:01:42.597 --> 01:01:45.597
<i>What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with you?</i>

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:55.910
I came to apologize. There's no
reason why you should forgive me.

01:01:55.911 --> 01:01:58.712
I just learned the truth
about you and Jim.

01:01:58.713 --> 01:02:00.881
I know it's you
who runs the railroad...

01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:02.582
and you who built
the John Galt Line.

01:02:02.583 --> 01:02:05.319
Can you forgive me?

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.922
Of course I forgive you.

01:02:07.922 --> 01:02:10.230
<i>Thank you, Dagny.</i>

01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:18.233
You might want to dial it down
just a little bit.

01:02:27.476 --> 01:02:29.977
Mr. Thompson sits between
science and industry.

01:02:29.978 --> 01:02:31.215
Dr. Stadler, please.

01:02:33.204 --> 01:02:34.982
The chair
on Mr. Thompson's left.

01:02:34.983 --> 01:02:38.687
Miss Taggart, to the right.

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:40.187
Showtime.

01:02:40.188 --> 01:02:42.032
Twenty seconds.

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:52.667
Am I a guest or prisoner?

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:55.102
That choice is yours.

01:02:55.103 --> 01:02:56.337
In 10...

01:02:56.338 --> 01:02:58.272
<i>Didn't you name
the John Galt Line after me?</i>

01:02:58.273 --> 01:03:00.442
<i>But I named it after my enemy.</i>

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:03.143
Well, that's the contradiction that
you're gonna have to figure out.

01:03:03.144 --> 01:03:04.946
...four,

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:06.947
three...
I won't be a part of this.

01:03:06.948 --> 01:03:09.584
You won't?

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.986
It's not just for the press, Miss Taggart.
It's for the audience also.

01:03:11.987 --> 01:03:14.455
- Dagny, for Christ's sake!
- Cherryl deserved better.

01:03:14.456 --> 01:03:17.459
Get her back here! Is anyone with
a brain left in this country?

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.129
- Dagny!
- Ladies and gentlemen, Head of State Thompson.

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:23.832
Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:26.039
<i>Tonight, I can t...</i>

01:03:31.039 --> 01:03:32.874
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:35.377
Mr. Thompson will not
speak to you tonight.

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:37.345
His time is up.

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:40.482
For years, you've asked,
"Who is John Galt?"

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:43.350
You've asked that question
in despair and resignation...

01:03:43.351 --> 01:03:46.021
as factories closed,
goods became scarce,

01:03:47.021 --> 01:03:49.290
jobs disappeared.

01:03:49.291 --> 01:03:51.625
Your lives are becoming
more difficult...

01:03:51.626 --> 01:03:55.430
as the life force of your world
is draining away.

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:59.767
You have asked that question
without expecting an answer.

01:03:59.768 --> 01:04:01.535
I'm here to answer it.

01:04:01.536 --> 01:04:04.641
This is John Galt speaking.

01:04:06.241 --> 01:04:09.410
<i>Mr. Thompson won't tell you the truth
about the crisis in your world.</i>

01:04:09.411 --> 01:04:11.379
<i>I will.</i>

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.549
<i>Have you noticed that as everything
around you seems to decline,</i>

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.984
<i>one thing still grows?</i>

01:04:16.985 --> 01:04:19.419
<i>It is the power of your rulers.</i>

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.555
<i>None of their plans
and directives...</i>

01:04:21.556 --> 01:04:25.392
<i>have solved your problems
or made your life better.</i>

01:04:25.393 --> 01:04:28.296
<i>The only result has been their
increased control over you...</i>

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:31.399
at the cost of your freedom.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.899
Do you know why?

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:35.870
<i>You gave them the power.</i>

01:04:35.871 --> 01:04:38.339
<i>They called for your sacrifice,</i>

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.774
<i>and you thought it was noble.</i>

01:04:40.775 --> 01:04:44.346
<i>They said if you worked
for yourself and your family,</i>

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:47.448
<i>that you were selfish
and uncaring.</i>

01:04:47.449 --> 01:04:49.951
And they made you feel ashamed.

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:53.488
They denounced the leaders of
industry as greedy exploiters...

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:55.434
The Ellis Wyatts,
the Hank Reardens.

01:04:56.057 --> 01:04:59.160
And again, you agreed.

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:00.928
And then you ask,

01:05:00.929 --> 01:05:04.799
"Why did they and others
like them disappear?"

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.535
I took them from you.

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:10.971
<i>Their achievements flowed
from their creative minds.</i>

01:05:10.972 --> 01:05:14.676
<i>Once they understood that the
attempt to control their work...</i>

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:17.678
<i>was an attempt
to control their minds,</i>

01:05:17.679 --> 01:05:19.480
<i>they left.</i>

01:05:19.481 --> 01:05:22.515
<i>The people on strike
worked for themselves,</i>

01:05:22.516 --> 01:05:25.153
<i>for their own vision
of what was possible.</i>

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:27.589
<i>When they recognized
the honor they deserved,</i>

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:32.158
<i>they rebelled against the guilt you
wanted them to feel for their success.</i>

01:05:32.159 --> 01:05:34.495
You counted on them
to keep producing,

01:05:34.496 --> 01:05:36.263
to keep thinking...

01:05:36.264 --> 01:05:39.332
Even as you denounced them
as selfish.

01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:44.205
<i>I showed them they were being
punished for their own virtues,</i>

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:47.241
and I showed them
how evil that is.

01:05:47.242 --> 01:05:50.710
I made it my mission
to help these heroes say no.

01:05:50.711 --> 01:05:52.747
All evil needs to win...

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:55.482
<i>is the consent of good people.</i>

01:05:55.483 --> 01:05:58.419
<i>They have joined me
to freely produce,</i>

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.087
<i>trade, cooperate
and compete in a place...</i>

01:06:01.088 --> 01:06:03.924
where the rights of all
are protected.

01:06:03.925 --> 01:06:06.227
Do not try to find us.

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:09.629
Do not try to bargain
for our return.

01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:11.333
Get out of our way.

01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:14.904
<i>To everyone within
the range of my voice,</i>

01:06:15.904 --> 01:06:18.272
you now have a choice to make.

01:06:18.273 --> 01:06:22.776
<i>If you decide to support the notion
of sacrifice enforced by the State,</i>

01:06:22.777 --> 01:06:24.414
<i>your game is up.</i>

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:27.515
<i>Your world
is in a downward spiral,</i>

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:30.186
<i>and you will ride it down
to destruction.</i>

01:06:30.943 --> 01:06:33.221
But if you share
the values of our strike,

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:36.659
if you believe that your life
is a sacred possession...

01:06:37.659 --> 01:06:39.928
<i>for you to make the most of,</i>

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:43.129
<i>if you want to live by the
judgment of your own mind,</i>

01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:45.799
not edicts from the State,

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.003
then follow our lead.

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:50.337
Do not support
your own oppressors.

01:06:50.338 --> 01:06:53.741
Stop letting the system
exploit you.

01:06:53.742 --> 01:06:58.245
<i>Form your own communities on the
frontiers of your crumbling world.</i>

01:06:58.246 --> 01:07:00.948
<i>Your rulers hold you
by your endurance...</i>

01:07:00.949 --> 01:07:03.218
<i>to carry the burdens
they impose,</i>

01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:06.187
<i>by your generosity
when you hear cries of despair,</i>

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:08.288
<i>and above all,
by your innocence,</i>

01:07:08.289 --> 01:07:12.292
<i>which cannot grasp
the depths of their evil.</i>

01:07:12.293 --> 01:07:14.830
<i>The world you are living in
is the world they wanted.</i>

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:16.730
<i>Leave them to it.</i>

01:07:16.731 --> 01:07:19.567
<i>Those who have left you are
eager to build a better world,</i>

01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:21.901
<i>a world of freedom
and opportunity,</i>

01:07:21.902 --> 01:07:24.238
a world based on mutual respect.

01:07:24.239 --> 01:07:26.374
In that world, you will
rise in the morning...

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.709
with the spirit
you knew in childhood...

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:31.212
The spirit of eagerness
and adventure...

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:33.580
and the confidence that
the world is what it is...

01:07:33.581 --> 01:07:35.549
and is there
for you to discover.

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:38.919
In that world, you will
not receive alms, nor pity,

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.988
nor forgiveness of sins,

01:07:40.989 --> 01:07:44.259
but honor, respect and justice.

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:48.162
Don't let the fire go out,
spark by irreplaceable spark,

01:07:48.163 --> 01:07:50.732
in confusion and despair.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.566
Be sure of your path.

01:07:52.567 --> 01:07:55.169
The world you desire can be won.

01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:59.073
It exists. It is real.
It is possible.

01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:01.341
It is yours.

01:08:01.342 --> 01:08:03.710
Come on, let's go.

01:08:03.711 --> 01:08:07.749
Did that just happen?
Stop that damned buzzing noise!

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:10.350
Go to regular programming.

01:08:10.351 --> 01:08:13.587
<i>Somebody has the courage
to tell the truth.</i>

01:08:13.588 --> 01:08:15.256
<i>"Be sure of your path."
Is that all you have?</i>

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:18.526
<i>If that speech doesn't do Thompson
in, I don't know what will.</i>

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:22.462
<i>It's not funny. The American
people need government.</i>

01:08:22.462 --> 01:08:25.399
<i>And I think that one of the rarest commodities
in this country right now is courage.</i>

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:26.966
<i>I think we saw
a lot of it tonight.</i>

01:08:26.966 --> 01:08:30.170
If we didn't cut it off, it'll look
like we authorized that speech.

01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:32.840
You damned fool! Would you rather
them think we didn't authorize it?

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:36.176
Muzzle those commentators!
Look. Galt is one man.

01:08:36.176 --> 01:08:39.112
I don't know who the hell he thinks he is,
but he needs to be arrested, humiliated!

01:08:39.113 --> 01:08:40.850
Oh, the public's not gonna believe that!
No, no, no, no.

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:43.283
That speech was way over their heads.
You know what?

01:08:43.283 --> 01:08:45.952
Galt was right about one thing. The
public can't think for themselves.

01:08:45.953 --> 01:08:47.889
They have to be controlled.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.555
What do you propose
we do, Floyd?

01:08:49.557 --> 01:08:52.626
He just gave you the answers.

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:55.863
- What more do you need to know?
- Dagny, I'll make him a deal.

01:08:56.064 --> 01:08:58.533
Good night, gentlemen.

01:08:59.267 --> 01:09:01.434
Dagny, thank you
for speaking your mind.

01:09:01.435 --> 01:09:03.504
I just want you to know
that you can trust us.

01:09:03.505 --> 01:09:05.339
We're not your enemies.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:07.442
We've made mistakes.
We're only human!

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:09.376
Find him, and then
we'll make him a deal.

01:09:09.377 --> 01:09:11.379
I don't think he's someone
who's open to a deal.

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.147
You just be careful
with this, okay?

01:09:13.148 --> 01:09:14.549
Everyone's open
to cutting a deal.

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:16.950
She's one of them.

01:09:16.951 --> 01:09:20.688
Just watch her. I think she
may be able to help us, huh?

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:22.590
You got it.

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:25.368
<i>Mr. Thompson stated,
"There is no cause for alarm."</i>

01:09:26.027 --> 01:09:29.264
<i>He urges the public not to draw
any uninformed conclusions,</i>

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:32.399
<i>to preserve a sense of broad-minded
tolerance and discipline.</i>

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:36.737
<i>Says Thompson, "We must regard it as
one viewpoint in our forum of opinion.</i>

01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:40.009
<i>The truth has many facets.
We must remain impartial."</i>

01:09:41.009 --> 01:09:44.578
No. No.

01:09:44.578 --> 01:09:46.313
We want Galt!
Yeah!

01:09:46.314 --> 01:09:48.015
- We want Galt!
- We want Galt!

01:09:49.015 --> 01:10:00.094
We want Galt!
We want Galt!

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:01.095
We want Galt!

01:10:02.029 --> 01:10:05.566
<i>We heard it on the streets.
We heard it online.</i>

01:10:05.567 --> 01:10:08.068
<i>We heard it everywhere.</i>

01:10:08.069 --> 01:10:10.470
<i>The people wanted Galt.</i>

01:10:10.471 --> 01:10:12.172
<i>Who's John Galt?</i>

01:10:12.173 --> 01:10:15.173
<i>I am John Galt.
I am John Galt.</i>

01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:17.211
<i>I am John Galt!</i>

01:10:17.212 --> 01:10:20.247
<i>Oh, my.
Are Thompson's days numbered.</i>

01:10:20.248 --> 01:10:22.316
<i>Who is John Galt?</i>

01:10:22.317 --> 01:10:24.786
<i>I have to tell you,
as I'm watching this myself,</i>

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:28.488
<i>I'm thinking,
"Scream it! Shout it!"</i>

01:10:28.489 --> 01:10:31.758
<i>But that would be the way I would
do it... in exactly the wrong way.</i>

01:10:31.759 --> 01:10:34.661
<i>Because nobody would hear it,
and he'd look like a mad man.</i>

01:10:34.662 --> 01:10:36.930
<i>Finally,
somebody says the truth...</i>

01:10:36.931 --> 01:10:39.968
<i>and says it the way
it was supposed to be said.</i>

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:45.639
<i>Power comes from the vision,
not the volume.</i>

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.241
We want Galt!

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:49.210
I want it stopped.

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:51.578
We want Galt!
We want Galt!

01:10:51.579 --> 01:10:54.317
Bring me Dagny Taggart.

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:57.622
We want Galt!
We want Galt!

01:11:01.622 --> 01:11:03.790
He doesn't need
to commit to anything.

01:11:03.791 --> 01:11:07.127
I just need him to know that
I'm ready to meet his terms,

01:11:07.128 --> 01:11:08.629
whatever they are.

01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:11.264
I really can't help you.

01:11:11.265 --> 01:11:15.368
We have tried,
but we cannot find Mr. Galt.

01:11:15.369 --> 01:11:16.970
Now, we've placed...

01:11:16.971 --> 01:11:20.374
What Mr. Thompson means to
say is, we hope he's alive.

01:11:20.375 --> 01:11:22.643
Miss Taggart,
I am a peaceful man.

01:11:22.644 --> 01:11:24.812
I simply want to help him.

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:28.549
What if someone not as amiable as Mr.
Thompson...

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:31.251
was to locate him before we did?

01:11:31.252 --> 01:11:33.219
I'd just hate to think...

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.389
Now, Floyd.

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:39.264
We're also offering
a substantial reward.

01:11:43.264 --> 01:11:45.335
I wouldn't know how to help you.

01:11:52.407 --> 01:11:54.774
Think she's lying?

01:11:54.775 --> 01:11:56.944
She knows where he is.

01:11:59.614 --> 01:12:01.715
We want Galt!
We want Galt!

01:12:01.716 --> 01:12:03.783
<i>John Galt represents today...</i>

01:12:03.784 --> 01:12:05.818
<i>the sentiment of millions
and millions of people...</i>

01:12:05.819 --> 01:12:08.354
<i>who are sick and tired
of the endless wars,</i>

01:12:08.355 --> 01:12:10.358
<i>the attacks
on our civil liberties,</i>

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:12.393
<i>the abuse of what's happening
in the economy,</i>

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:14.260
<i>the poverty that is coming.</i>

01:12:14.261 --> 01:12:17.430
<i>And those are the people who are
speaking out, and they needed a voice.</i>

01:12:17.431 --> 01:12:19.645
<i>John Galt, in many ways,
is that voice.</i>

01:13:14.721 --> 01:13:16.490
Hey!

01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:51.379
I was so afraid.
I had to warn you.

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.594
You don't need to explain,
but you were followed.

01:13:54.595 --> 01:13:56.362
I don't think so.
I made sure...

01:13:56.363 --> 01:13:59.066
You know, one thing they're good at is
snooping. They'll be here any minute.

01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:01.203
Then let's get out of here right now.
No. No.

01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:05.171
From now on, you have to make them
think that you are on their side,

01:14:05.172 --> 01:14:06.475
that I'm your enemy.
What?

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:09.175
If you do, I have
a chance to survive this.

01:14:09.176 --> 01:14:13.145
They need me alive, but they wouldn't
think twice about hurting you or worse.

01:14:13.146 --> 01:14:15.148
And I couldn't stand that.

01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:18.751
If I hear of it, I will kill
myself and stop them right there.

01:14:18.752 --> 01:14:22.089
Convince them that you hate me.

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:25.090
You must. Do you understand?
I do.

01:14:33.067 --> 01:14:36.571
So you lived here, all
these years, like this?

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:39.143
Well,

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:42.445
more like this.

01:14:44.445 --> 01:14:47.081
The motor!

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:50.082
We have to hide it.
It's all right.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.653
Mr. Galt!
Open up, sir.

01:14:53.654 --> 01:14:56.756
All right. Don't be afraid.
Okay?

01:14:56.757 --> 01:14:58.064
It's okay.

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:03.064
Mr. Galt!

01:15:06.857 --> 01:15:09.135
- That's him. That's John Galt.
- Get out!

01:15:09.136 --> 01:15:12.306
Stay where you are, sir. Ma'am,
I need you to back up, please.

01:15:12.506 --> 01:15:14.441
Right there.

01:15:14.442 --> 01:15:16.165
We need to see some ID, please.

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:19.145
I'm Dagny Taggart.
He's the one.

01:15:19.146 --> 01:15:21.146
Both of you. He's the one
we've been looking for.

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:23.416
Mr. Thompson is waiting
to speak with him in person.

01:15:23.417 --> 01:15:26.855
Tell you what. I'll cooperate if
you get this woman away from me.

01:15:27.055 --> 01:15:29.444
Is that room clear?
Miss Taggart, thank you.

01:15:29.644 --> 01:15:31.791
You can step outside.
We'll handle things from here.

01:15:31.792 --> 01:15:34.161
I'll be expecting my reward.

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:37.774
Miss Taggart, Mr. Thompson will be
very grateful for your efforts.

01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:43.470
Mr. Galt.

01:15:45.206 --> 01:15:47.177
It's an honor, sir.

01:15:50.177 --> 01:15:51.944
What are you looking for?

01:15:51.945 --> 01:15:55.581
Just to be certain that you're out of
danger, sir. The men'll just be a moment.

01:15:55.582 --> 01:15:57.451
- Am I under arrest?
- No, sir.

01:15:57.452 --> 01:16:00.086
Our orders are to escort you
safely to Head of State Thompson,

01:16:00.087 --> 01:16:02.092
where your presence is needed.

01:16:05.092 --> 01:16:07.193
- It won't open.
- Mr. Galt, sir?

01:16:07.194 --> 01:16:09.530
It's locked. Would you mind
unlocking that door, please?

01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:13.134
- There's no key.
- Sir, I have orders to search the entire apartment.

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:15.580
- It would be helpful if...
- Go right ahead.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:30.216
No amount of force will grant
you access to that motor.

01:16:30.217 --> 01:16:31.751
Allow me.

01:16:31.752 --> 01:16:34.787
"I swear by my life
and my love of it...

01:16:34.788 --> 01:16:36.822
that I will never live
for the sake of another man...

01:16:36.823 --> 01:16:39.463
nor ask another man
to live for mine."

01:16:42.463 --> 01:16:44.734
We got nothing.

01:16:46.734 --> 01:16:48.743
We need to go.

01:16:55.743 --> 01:17:06.186
We want Galt!
We want Galt!

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:11.090
Hello?
<i>Well, well.</i>

01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:14.626
John? <i>So you're the young
fella that started all this.</i>

01:17:14.729 --> 01:17:17.364
I'm tickled pink to meet ya.
Just tickled pink.

01:17:17.365 --> 01:17:19.365
I'm Thompson.
How do you do?

01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:23.039
Make yourself comfortable.
You're... You're an important man.

01:17:26.039 --> 01:17:29.845
Yeah, that was
some speech you made.

01:17:30.845 --> 01:17:33.580
You've done something
to this country.

01:17:33.581 --> 01:17:35.381
I don't know what or why.

01:17:35.382 --> 01:17:39.055
But... people seem to want
what it is you sell.

01:17:40.912 --> 01:17:43.357
Now, I may not agree
with everything you say,

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:46.292
but I'm always willing
to change my mind.

01:17:46.293 --> 01:17:50.571
Now, you don't... you don't expect us to
agree with everything you say, do ya?

01:17:51.097 --> 01:17:53.599
No. Yeah.
You want something to drink?

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.469
Get him something to drink.

01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:59.637
Well, the world's in a hell of
a mess, just like you said.

01:18:00.007 --> 01:18:02.211
On that, I do agree with you.

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:04.934
Sit down there, Floyd.
Sit down.

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:09.354
Thank you.

01:18:13.354 --> 01:18:14.457
So...

01:18:16.457 --> 01:18:18.625
what do you have to say?

01:18:18.626 --> 01:18:20.229
Nothing.

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:22.229
Nothing?

01:18:24.164 --> 01:18:26.599
I didn't ask to speak with you.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.702
Yeah, but we have
a lot to discuss.

01:18:29.703 --> 01:18:32.605
<i>Now...</i>

01:18:32.606 --> 01:18:34.375
<i>I'm offering you a deal.</i>

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.447
Well,

01:18:39.403 --> 01:18:40.848
I'm always open to a deal.

01:18:41.048 --> 01:18:44.251
I knew it!
I knew it!

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:46.752
I told those theorizers of mine.

01:18:46.753 --> 01:18:51.425
I'm always open to a deal with
anyone who has a value to offer me.

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:54.260
Well, then, hell,
write your own ticket.

01:18:54.261 --> 01:18:55.861
What are you offering?
Anything you want.

01:18:55.997 --> 01:18:58.997
Such as?
Well, your terms, of course.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.068
Lookit...
Listen, I am certain...

01:19:02.069 --> 01:19:06.172
that you are a man
that can make things work?

01:19:06.173 --> 01:19:10.911
I'm ready to give in. I'm... I
am willing to amend the system.

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:13.248
I told you what to do.

01:19:14.248 --> 01:19:15.519
What?

01:19:18.519 --> 01:19:21.455
Get out of the way.

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:23.256
Wait a second.

01:19:23.257 --> 01:19:25.791
Now, now, now,
I said "amend."

01:19:25.792 --> 01:19:27.070
I didn't say "abandon."

01:19:30.053 --> 01:19:31.831
That's just out of the question.

01:19:31.832 --> 01:19:34.438
You see,

01:19:37.438 --> 01:19:40.907
I am offering you
Wesley Mouch's job.

01:19:40.908 --> 01:19:42.675
Huh?

01:19:42.676 --> 01:19:44.678
Now, there's nothing
bigger than that.

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:46.513
You're free to do
anything at all.

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:49.549
You don't like regulations?
Well, repeal 'em.

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:52.606
You... You want higher profits,
lower wages? Decree 'em.

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:55.456
You want special privileges?
Grant them.

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:58.191
You don't like the unions?
Dissolve 'em.

01:19:58.192 --> 01:20:00.126
You play it any way you want,

01:20:00.127 --> 01:20:02.362
but... just think about it.

01:20:02.363 --> 01:20:06.800
<i>In Washington, everyone's gonna
want to be your best friend.</i>

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:08.137
Oh.

01:20:10.137 --> 01:20:13.173
You're gonna have power.

01:20:29.548 --> 01:20:33.160
Wait. Now, what? What? I'm offering
you the best job in the world.

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:34.961
What is...
What is wrong with that?

01:20:34.962 --> 01:20:38.266
But that kind of job
shouldn't exist.

01:20:40.266 --> 01:20:42.715
No one should have
that kind of power.

01:20:53.715 --> 01:20:56.956
I can't figure you out.

01:21:01.956 --> 01:21:03.456
Get him out of here.

01:21:03.457 --> 01:21:06.559
And take that idiot
Taggart with you.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.400
- SSI?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.067
We want Galt!
We want Galt!

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:47.645
Get him out!

01:21:57.645 --> 01:22:00.613
<i>Once standing as a monument
to American individualism,</i>

01:22:00.614 --> 01:22:04.654
<i>the Taggart Bridge had finally
surrendered to regulation.</i>

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:18.398
Dagny! Oh!

01:22:18.399 --> 01:22:21.634
Did you hear? The Taggart
Bridge collapsed.

01:22:21.635 --> 01:22:24.938
Listen, Frisco, I'm ready.

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:27.139
"I swear by my life
and my love of it...

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.908
that I will never live
for the sake of another man...

01:22:29.909 --> 01:22:33.212
nor ask another man
to live for mine."

01:22:33.213 --> 01:22:35.250
Let's go, slugger.

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:38.757
Ragnar has his helicopter
standing by.

01:22:43.757 --> 01:22:45.532
Secure him there.

01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:53.966
Project F?

01:22:53.967 --> 01:22:56.137
What the hell are we doing here?

01:22:57.137 --> 01:22:58.693
This was never my intention.

01:22:59.039 --> 01:23:01.744
John, this is not my fault!

01:23:04.344 --> 01:23:07.546
You might want to leave, Jimmy boy.
This is gonna get ugly.

01:23:07.547 --> 01:23:11.184
No. I want to be here. I wanna... I
wanna see this. I wanna see him break.

01:23:11.185 --> 01:23:13.997
Okay. Your choice.

01:23:22.997 --> 01:23:26.975
Cuffy? Stand by
to initialize power.

01:23:35.743 --> 01:23:39.813
Get this straight.
You are going to help us.

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:42.314
Agree, and all this goes away.

01:23:42.315 --> 01:23:45.057
You understand?

01:23:50.057 --> 01:23:51.724
Suit yourself, genius.

01:23:51.725 --> 01:23:55.094
Of all people, not him!
I want no part of this.

01:23:55.095 --> 01:23:57.865
Then get out of here before I
make you trade places with him.

01:23:58.065 --> 01:24:00.078
Go on, go!

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:36.975
Again.

01:24:41.975 --> 01:24:44.777
I'm here on behalf
of Mr. Thompson.

01:24:44.778 --> 01:24:47.179
You wouldn't disobey an order
from Mr. Thompson, would you?

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:49.681
No. You're...
You're Dagny Taggart.

01:24:49.682 --> 01:24:52.218
Then on direct order
from Mr. Thompson,

01:24:52.219 --> 01:24:53.952
you are to let me in
immediately.

01:24:53.953 --> 01:24:56.857
No. Dr. Ferris said I wasn't
supposed to let just anyone in.

01:24:56.858 --> 01:24:59.459
You need to make a decision.

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:02.694
Listen to me very carefully.
This is about your life.

01:25:02.695 --> 01:25:06.832
<i>If you die, you won't know
what you're dying for.</i>

01:25:06.833 --> 01:25:09.435
<i>If I die, I will.</i>

01:25:09.436 --> 01:25:13.639
Either you let me in,
or I shoot.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:16.108
- Now decide.
- I'm not supposed to decide.

01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:17.578
I'm just an average guy.
One.

01:25:17.778 --> 01:25:19.812
I'm not supposed to make
decisions about my life.

01:25:19.813 --> 01:25:22.482
- Two.
- I haven't said I won't. I haven't said I will.

01:25:22.483 --> 01:25:24.493
- Three.
- I'm only following orders!

01:25:33.493 --> 01:25:35.063
Make sure it's okay in here.

01:25:36.063 --> 01:25:38.063
All right.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:42.535
Had enough?

01:25:42.536 --> 01:25:47.506
I understand you're some kind
of electrical engineer.

01:25:47.507 --> 01:25:51.012
So tell me, Mr. Galt,
in your expert opinion,

01:25:53.012 --> 01:25:54.784
how we doing?

01:25:57.784 --> 01:25:59.167
Again.

01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:14.648
Again.

01:26:27.648 --> 01:26:30.250
I think Project F likes you.

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:31.251
Again.

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:34.957
Okay.

01:26:36.957 --> 01:26:38.959
Do it.

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.493
Do it!

01:26:41.494 --> 01:26:44.229
- What's the matter?
- What's the problem?

01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:45.997
- What?
- How the hell would I know?

01:26:45.998 --> 01:26:49.167
- Well, find someone who does!
- Hey, watch your tone.

01:26:49.168 --> 01:26:51.404
Come on.

01:26:51.405 --> 01:26:54.674
Replace the fuse,
and the machine will work.

01:26:54.675 --> 01:26:58.413
This is ridiculous!
I won't have it!

01:26:59.413 --> 01:27:01.413
I won't have it!

01:27:01.414 --> 01:27:03.450
Do it! Do it! Hey, hey.
Jimmy, calm down!

01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:06.255
Jimmy...
Come on. Come on!

01:27:08.255 --> 01:27:11.128
We'll be back,
you son of a bitch!

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:33.479
John! John!

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:36.181
John! John.
Damn it! Damn it!

01:27:36.182 --> 01:27:38.020
I swear by my life!

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:41.121
John, come back to me!

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:42.122
Come back!

01:27:44.024 --> 01:27:45.061
John!

01:27:48.061 --> 01:27:49.629
Damn it!

01:27:49.630 --> 01:27:52.502
Damn it.
You're... You're alive!

01:27:54.502 --> 01:27:57.437
Thank goodness.

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:59.438
You're here! I'm back. I'm back.

01:27:59.672 --> 01:28:01.640
I love you.
I'm okay.

01:28:01.641 --> 01:28:04.277
- John.
- Hold him, hold him, hold him.

01:28:04.278 --> 01:28:07.246
Okay. I got him.
I got him.

01:28:07.247 --> 01:28:10.619
Give me your arm. Give me your arm, John.
Go ahead. I got it.

01:28:12.619 --> 01:28:15.371
We got ya. We got ya, John.
We got ya.

01:28:15.372 --> 01:28:16.976
We got ya.

01:28:35.976 --> 01:28:38.747
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

01:28:39.747 --> 01:28:42.822
Come on.
We're almost there.

01:28:47.822 --> 01:28:49.878
Okay, careful. Careful.
Hang in there.

01:28:57.465 --> 01:29:00.465
I got the door.
Grab my hand.

01:29:01.301 --> 01:29:02.935
Get in! Get in!

01:29:02.936 --> 01:29:05.604
Midas is waiting on the other side
of the trees. Don't worry about it.

01:29:05.605 --> 01:29:08.174
We've got one more man to pick up.
We'll see you soon.

01:29:08.175 --> 01:29:10.175
Eddie.
Thank you.

01:29:10.177 --> 01:29:12.372
Let's go.

01:29:38.372 --> 01:29:41.072
<i>Chopper 2.
We are airborne.</i>

01:29:41.073 --> 01:29:43.779
<i>You're cleared
to head back to Atlantis.</i>

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:46.711
<i>Dr. Hendricks
is standing by.</i>

01:29:46.712 --> 01:29:48.715
<i>Tell John he's in good hands.</i>

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:50.582
Just lie still.
Lie still.

01:29:50.583 --> 01:29:53.583
Who's Ragnar talking to?
Midas.

01:29:53.654 --> 01:29:56.855
He's flying
the other helicopter.

01:29:56.856 --> 01:29:59.658
We tried. We couldn't stop him
and the others from coming.

01:29:59.659 --> 01:30:02.394
Don't worry, John.
We've got your back.

01:30:02.395 --> 01:30:04.764
Good.

01:30:04.765 --> 01:30:06.400
Yeah.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:10.135
Escaped?
What do you mean?

01:30:10.136 --> 01:30:13.072
What?
Wh-Where's Ferris?

01:30:13.073 --> 01:30:15.976
What do you mean, tied up?

01:30:16.976 --> 01:30:18.779
Hello? Hello?

01:30:20.913 --> 01:30:23.320
What the hell is happening?

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.858
John.

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:33.631
I need you to know,
I never wanted to leave you.

01:30:37.631 --> 01:30:39.215
You're my forever.

01:30:55.215 --> 01:30:56.787
It's the end.

01:31:00.787 --> 01:31:02.590
No.

01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:05.152
It's the beginning.

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:33.752
<i>In the name
of the best within you,</i>

01:31:33.753 --> 01:31:36.488
<i>do not sacrifice your sense
of life to an enemy...</i>

01:31:36.489 --> 01:31:38.357
<i>that would claim
your precious mind.</i>

01:31:38.358 --> 01:31:42.562
<i>Do not let your fire go out,
spark by irreplaceable spark.</i>

01:31:42.563 --> 01:31:46.532
<i>Do not let the hero in your soul
perish in lonely frustration...</i>

01:31:46.533 --> 01:31:51.336
<i>for the life you deserve, but
have never been able to reach.</i>

01:31:51.337 --> 01:31:54.473
<i>The world you desire can be won.</i>

01:31:54.474 --> 01:31:59.478
<i>It exists. It is real.
It is possible.</i>

01:31:59.479 --> 01:32:01.615
<i>It is yours.</i>

01:32:02.615 --> 01:32:04.608
<i>This is John Galt speaking.</i>
