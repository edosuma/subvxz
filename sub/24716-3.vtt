00:06.673 --> 00:08.633
-Any candidates?
-Hatcher...

00:08.925 --> 00:11.136
You’re done now. Or I’ll be back.

00:11.302 --> 00:14.472
I wish to hell it was me, Sipowicz,
but it’s not.

00:14.931 --> 00:17.225
Lay off the twinkies, pal.
You’re goin’ soft.

00:19.936 --> 00:20.937
What?

00:21.062 --> 00:22.522
What you’re doing could be misinterpreted.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.608
I think I’d rather be misinterpreted
than walk around with a stick up my ass.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.235
Clark’s in his car, racked out.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.987

00:32.323 --> 00:34.117
What’s so tough about updating me
on cases?

00:34.325 --> 00:36.453
-We got a system here.
-It’s changed.

00:36.619 --> 00:39.080
And you better change,
or you better leave.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.388
-What do we got?
-Uh... Lester Byrd.

00:55.513 --> 00:58.349
-Shot three times in the chest.
-I can see where he’s shot, Medavoy.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.602
-Who called it in?
-Neighbor across the hall.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.562
She didn’t see anything,
just heard the shots.

01:02.979 --> 01:06.816
Super let uniform in.
Rita and Laura are talking to him now.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.610
Apparently it was about 7:15.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.653
"It" being when the neighbor
said the shots were fired

01:10.737 --> 01:13.323
-or when uniform got in?
-Um... Shots.

01:13.531 --> 01:15.867
John Clark, 15th squad. Glad to meet you.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.954
-Uh... We’ll get a canvass started.
-Let’s just do the job.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.415
That's what I’ve been doing
the past 20 minutes.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.794
We talked to the next-door neighbor.
He says, "Byrd was an ex-con."

01:25.960 --> 01:27.629
-(PHONE RINGS)
-Thinks he got out pretty recently.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.631
-How recent?
-Within the past week.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.800
He also said Byrd complained
about a woman harassing him.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.009
-Yeah?
-JOHN: Girlfriend? Wife?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.427
-LAURA: He didn’t know.
-ANDY: All right.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.262
-I'm on my way.
-I’ll get started on the phone dump.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.889
We’ll see
what the other neighbors have to say.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.057
JOHN: Okay.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.853
It was Connie. Theo didn’t show up
at school this mornin'.

01:43.978 --> 01:46.731
The girl that walks him should have
had him there half hour ago.

01:46.856 --> 01:49.275
-Well, where is she?
-ANDY: She’s not answering her cell.

01:49.734 --> 01:52.529
We got this covered.
Andy, if you need anything, call.

02:01.788 --> 02:02.914
-Mr. Sipowicz?
-Yes.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.291
Victoria Brinkers.
I’m the associate principal.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.585
I just got off the phone with your wife.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.337
-Theo arrived.
-Is he all right?

02:09.420 --> 02:10.922
He seems to be. This way.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.343
-Was there anyone with him?
-The guard said he was by himself.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.263
-What happened?
-VICTORIA: We’re not sure. Here he is.

Hey, kiddo.

-You want to tell me, where you’ve been?
-It wasn’t my fault.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.857
-He told me we were gonna see you.
-Who told you?

02:29.315 --> 02:31.442
-The detective.
-What detective?

02:31.526 --> 02:33.236
The one who said you had to see me.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.446
This detective,
did he show you a shield like mine?

02:35.655 --> 02:36.698
Yeah.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.491
Honey, would you know him
if you saw him again?

02:38.658 --> 02:41.494
-I don’t know.
-Okay, uh, so what did he do then?

02:41.703 --> 02:43.121
Took me to his car.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.916
Theo... when you were in his car,

02:47.292 --> 02:51.087
did he do anything?
Did he touch you or try to touch you?

02:51.504 --> 02:52.547
No.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.633
(SIGHS) He just drove us around.
Then he dropped me off.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.720
He didn’t do anything to you
while you were in the car except drive?

-Uh-huh.

Down the street. She lets me walk
from the corner by myself.

03:08.730 --> 03:12.192
Listen, buddy, you know you
are never supposed to talk to strangers,

03:12.275 --> 03:14.527
no matter what.
We talked about this, remember?

03:14.652 --> 03:17.655
-But he said he was your friend, Dad.
-Anybody could say that, Theo.

03:17.739 --> 03:21.367
But he knew stuff
about Matt havin' a cold last week

03:21.451 --> 03:24.537
-and Mom’s birthday.
-He mentioned those specifically?

03:25.955 --> 03:28.750

-Oh...

05:11.394 --> 05:12.395
Thanks.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.524
What do we know about the victim
this morning?

05:17.650 --> 05:20.653
Byrd was released from Clinton
about, uh, two months ago.

05:20.778 --> 05:25.158
Did six years on a five-to-ten for rape.
Got a long sheet, mostly sex crimes.

05:25.533 --> 05:28.119
We found a, uh, second neighbor
who said Byrd had complained

05:28.202 --> 05:30.371
about being harassed by a woman.
He didn’t get her name.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.789
I’ve got a call into his parole officer.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.876
Yeah, we dumped his phone,
and his last call was to a Drew Deroche.

05:34.959 --> 05:38.921
He’s also got a sheet, armed robbery,
assault. We’re gonna pick him up.

05:39.255 --> 05:42.925
Good. Heard there was an issue
with your family. Is everything all right?

05:43.009 --> 05:45.261
(CLEARS THROAT)
It turned out to be a false alarm.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.138
-RITA: Theo okay?
-Yeah, he’s fine.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.599
-Glad to hear it, Andy.
-Thanks.

against lost time,

I’ll let this one slide.

ANDY: Yeah, listen, uh,
I got to sit out this homicide today.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.359
-Why?
-I’m behind in my fives and need a day

05:59.442 --> 06:02.945
to catch up. Baldwin can work the case
with John, if that’s okay.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.572
-Sure.
-Hey, why not?

06:04.906 --> 06:06.949
I don’t like taking detectives
off their catching order

06:07.033 --> 06:08.368
because they get behind
in the paperwork.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.079
The longer I wait, the longer
it’s gonna take to get caught up.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.040
One day.
And I’m not setting precedent here.

said he wasn’t hurt or anything?

-Tell me what happened.
-I walked Theo to school, same as always.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.328
He said you let him off at the corner
instead of walking him to the gate.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.205
Because he asked me to.

06:54.497 --> 06:57.083
He says the other kids make fun of him
when they see me with him.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.127
But I always watch to make sure
he gets in okay.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.461
Are you saying you did that today?

07:01.129 --> 07:03.339
No. I got a call on my cell.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.842
I looked away for ten seconds.

07:06.092 --> 07:10.138
Ten seconds, Mr. Sipowicz, I swear.
I looked back. I didn’t see Theo.

07:10.471 --> 07:11.889

-I’m so sorry.
-We tried callin' you.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.436
We couldn’t get through. Why was that?

07:16.561 --> 07:18.104
ANNA: I think the battery
in my phone died.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.690
I must have left it on
after I got that call or something.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.234
I’m really sorry this happened,
Mr. Sipowicz.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.903
I hope you still want me
to help out with Theo.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.156
This is serious, Anna.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.659
-I know.
-ANDY: It’s a crime, kidnapping.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.745
People are gonna go to prison.
Anybody who had anything to do with it

07:34.829 --> 07:37.999
-is going to prison. Do you understand?
-What does that have to do with me?

07:38.082 --> 07:40.793
This guy got his hands on Theo
because you turned your back.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.920
On top of which, he knew things about us,

07:43.045 --> 07:45.506
things that only someone close to us
would know.

You think I had somethin' to do with it?
No. Mr. Sipowicz.

07:48.843 --> 07:52.346
You’re an adult, Anna. You will go
to prison if you don’t tell me the truth.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.473
I’m telling the truth.

for help with it. Who was it?

-Nobody. It happened the way that I said.
-Don’t lie to me.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.941
I’m not. You gotta believe me!

08:04.108 --> 08:05.902
Maybe you needed money
or you got in trouble,

08:05.985 --> 08:08.070
but somebody got to you.
I wanna know who it was.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.572
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

-There isn’t one!

-How’s that goin’?
-Peaches and cream.

08:43.564 --> 08:45.650
This mean I don’t have to check in
with my PO?

08:46.651 --> 08:49.737
-You know a Lester Byrd?
-Les and I did some time up in Clinton.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.281
-We shared a cell.
-Any contact since you got out?

08:52.406 --> 08:54.700
We talk every now and then.
He called last night.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.077
Yeah? What about?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.828
I’ve been doin'
some shape-up construction work.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.539
He wanted me to recommend him
for a crew.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.624
Where were you at 7:15 this morning?

09:01.707 --> 09:04.001
Tearin' out a kitchen at 85th in Broadway.

09:04.168 --> 09:08.297
We started a little before 7:00.
If Les is in trouble, I got no part of it.

-Anyone can confirm you were there?
-The Foreman, Steve Pines.

09:13.010 --> 09:16.639
Look, all I did was tell Les
I would give his name to some guys.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.182
Les is dead.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.478
-For real?
-He was shot.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.314
Ah... Man. The poor, dumb asshole.

A rapist tends not to be
the most popular guy on the cellblock.

09:27.900 --> 09:31.696
-You know anybody who had a beef with him?
-No, no. Les was a get-along type.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.156
He didn’t have the physique
for confrontation,

09:34.240 --> 09:36.993
-if you know what I mean.
-What about since he got out?

09:37.118 --> 09:38.411
Hmm... I don’t know.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.163
There was a woman.
She was really on his ass.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.291
-You know why?
-I never got the whole story,

09:43.374 --> 09:46.210
-but, uh, she said Lester had done her.
-She was one of the women he raped?

09:46.294 --> 09:48.504
That’s what she said.
Lester said "No." I don’t judge.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.923
(CLEARS THROAT)

09:51.007 --> 09:53.009
Oh, calling him up and yelling at him.

09:53.342 --> 09:55.511
Calling his PO,
trying to get him violated.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.430
This one job he applied for,
she made a stink,

09:57.513 --> 09:59.348
and they wouldn’t hire him
it was a big hassle.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.933
Well, do you blame her
for being pissed off?

10:01.017 --> 10:04.312

Les did his time, all right?

-Can I go?
-Where we can reach your foreman?

10:27.752 --> 10:30.921
Talked to the DA's office.
They say that Byrd was originally charged

10:31.005 --> 10:34.008
-with three rapes.
-Three rapes and he did six years?

10:34.216 --> 10:38.137
They dropped two of the cases.
Apparently, the DNA evidence went bad,

10:38.220 --> 10:40.473
somethin' about the lab
contaminating the samples.

10:40.556 --> 10:43.309
Let me guess, Hillary Blair
was one of the cases that got dropped.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.894
-Yeah.
-I talked to Byrd’s PO.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.479
He said Blair called him a couple of times

10:46.646 --> 10:48.773
claiming he violated parole,
but nothing panned out.

-Who were the other two victims?

10:54.153 --> 10:57.031
Okay. Bring in Blair
and look into the other two.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.954
-Blair’s already on her way in.
-And I ran the other victims.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.499
Kathy Markowitz died
in a car accident two years ago.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.584
She was the one
whose case actually went to trial.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.003
And I’m waiting on an address
for Eliza Todd.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.382
You weren’t around,
and we didn’t wanna wait.

11:14.465 --> 11:17.093
That’s okay if you get a good lead,
you don’t have to track me down.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.054
-Just keep me informed.
-Absolutely.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.393
-Where’s Sipowicz?
-He had to run an errand.

11:25.559 --> 11:28.854
I didn’t see him signed out in the book.
I didn’t get a chance to tell him

11:28.938 --> 11:30.314
about the log before he left.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.192
Tell him when he gets back,
and get his name in the book.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.121
Hatcher.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.709
-What are you doing here?
-Where were you at 8:00 this morning?

11:50.501 --> 11:52.294
-What?
-Answer the question.

11:52.586 --> 11:56.340
-Drop dead.
-I said, "Answer the question."

11:57.341 --> 12:00.761
Hands off, Sipowicz, or you’re gonna be
looking at an assault charge.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.264
He’s a kidder, this guy.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.017
You wanna tell me what this is about?

12:07.101 --> 12:09.645
Someone rode my son around
in a car this mornin'.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.021
And you think I did it?

12:11.188 --> 12:12.398
-Where were you?
-STAN: At the gym.

12:12.898 --> 12:15.234
Which you can confirm
with the guy who checked me in,

12:15.401 --> 12:17.236
the guy who spotted me
when I was doing the bench press,

12:17.361 --> 12:18.863
and about ten other people.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.781
-I will.
-STAN: New York Fitness.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.700
St. Marks on second. Knock yourself out.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.327
If you were behind this thing today,
you wanna tell me now.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.538
You’re losing it, Sipowicz. You know that?

12:27.621 --> 12:29.707
’Cause if I find out you’re lyin’,

12:29.790 --> 12:32.460
I’m coming down on you
harder than you can imagine.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.129
How do I get this
through your thick skull?

12:35.546 --> 12:37.882
Whatever happened to your kid,
I had nothin' to do with it.

12:37.965 --> 12:41.135
That better be true. ’Cause one way
or another, I’m finding out.

12:41.260 --> 12:45.097
Okay, look, all joking aside,
and I say this as a friend,

12:45.639 --> 12:47.057
you’re ready for the rubber room, dude.

12:47.266 --> 12:50.561
If ever find that you’re threatening
my wife or children...

12:51.395 --> 12:52.646
I’ll kill you.

12:52.855 --> 12:56.358
-Still big with the empty threats, I see.
-It’s not a threat, Hatcher.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.568
That’s a promise.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.197
(CHUCKLES)

13:19.173 --> 13:22.384
-Uh... Detective, if you wouldn’t mind.
-No, I’m busy, John.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.011
It’ll just take a second.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.932
-Please?
-(SIGHS) Why, <i>der Führer </i>come after you?

13:28.265 --> 13:30.643
Let’s just say
I’d consider it a personal favor.

13:30.893 --> 13:35.356
(SIGHS) This guy is gonna have us raisin'
our hands asking if we can go wee-wee.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.566
Thank you so much.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.573
-Hey, Medavoy...
-GREG: Yeah, Andy?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.493
-You busy?
-Not especially.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.955
These pranks are starting
to get out of hand.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.957
I gotta do something about it
before somebody gets hurt.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.459
-You mind helpin' out?
-Sure. What can I do?

13:55.584 --> 13:57.086
ANDY: I’m going through my old files,

13:57.336 --> 13:59.672
picking out guys
who might have something against me.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.007
If I put a list together,
could you run some names?

14:02.132 --> 14:04.677
Find out if a guy’s been released,
where they’re living now?

14:04.760 --> 14:06.095
Yeah, no problem.

14:07.805 --> 14:08.973
(SIGHS)

14:09.515 --> 14:11.392
It’s gonna be quite a list, Andy.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.353
The rate I’m goin' at,
it’s in the low 1000s.

14:14.436 --> 14:17.773
Well, anything I can do to help.
Be like old times.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.318
I mean, if we’d ever actually
partnered up.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.487
Yeah.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.662
-JOHN: Have a seat, Ms. Blair.
-I want to know.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.498
Am I here
because Lester Byrd complained about me?

14:34.957 --> 14:36.083
Why do you ask?

14:36.458 --> 14:39.503
Byrd told me he was gonna call the police
if I didn’t leave him alone,

14:39.670 --> 14:41.297
it’s definition of irony.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.674
Look, I haven’t done anything illegal.

14:43.841 --> 14:47.761
If Byrd’s uncomfortable
or thinks he’s being harassed, too bad.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.598
Uh...
No, we haven’t had a complaint from him.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.349
Good. I guess.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.812
-Then why am I here?
-We need you to answer a few questions.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.066
-Where were you at 7:30 this morning?
-Taking a shower at home.

15:01.275 --> 15:04.194
-Can anyone confirm that?
-HILLARY: (CHUCKLING) Of course not.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.530
What’s this about?

15:06.989 --> 15:09.950
-Lester Byrd was killed today.
-My God.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.454
-My God. How?
-He was shot.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.958
And you think I had somethin'
to do with it?

15:18.083 --> 15:20.753
Well, we’re talking to everyone
who had contact with him recently.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.756
-Yeah, it’s routine.
-Why do I have trouble believing that?

15:24.089 --> 15:28.385
Look, I can’t pretend I’m broken up
by the news, but I didn’t kill Byrd.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.846
Well, you seem to have gone
out of your way to make contact with him.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.765
-You care to tell us why?
-Why is it relevant?

15:32.848 --> 15:36.435
We see a lot of crime victims.
Not many do what you’ve done.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.814
Byrd was supposed to go away
for 20 years, okay?

15:41.857 --> 15:43.859
The DA said he was gonna plead guilty.

15:44.234 --> 15:47.738
It was all simple.
Then the DNA got thrown out.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.866
And because two of us made weak IDs
in the lineup,

15:50.950 --> 15:53.953
our cases were dropped.
And if that weren’t enough,

15:54.161 --> 15:56.330
Byrd started saying
that he was the victim,

15:56.956 --> 15:58.540
that he’d been framed.

15:59.375 --> 16:03.087
Lester Byrd was in my apartment
for three hours.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.924
I remember when he tied my hands
above my head

16:07.007 --> 16:08.968
and put duct tape over my eyes.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.596
I remember when he whispered
in my ear... in my left ear

16:12.805 --> 16:15.057
that it wasn’t rape because he loved me.

16:16.225 --> 16:20.020
And he wants to pretend it didn’t happen?
To make me disappear?

16:21.230 --> 16:22.398
Not a chance.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.236
You have much contact with Eliza Todd?

16:28.779 --> 16:30.322
We talk from time to time.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.241
You ever talk about Byrd?

16:32.366 --> 16:34.159
I don’t think
I’m gonna answer that question.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.495
Ms. Blair, we’re not asking you
to incriminate anyone.

16:36.745 --> 16:39.081
-No?
-The more information you can give us,

16:39.206 --> 16:42.376
-the quicker we can rule people out.
-Do I look stupid to you?

16:42.459 --> 16:44.378
BALDWIN: Look, ma’am,
if we don’t ask you these questions,

16:44.503 --> 16:46.839
-we wouldn’t be doing our job.
-HILLARY: Do your job!

16:47.006 --> 16:48.966
But you’re crazy if you think

16:49.049 --> 16:50.759
I’m gonna help you find
whoever killed Byrd.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.970
Well, that can be construed
as obstruction of justice.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.055
I don’t give a damn!

16:56.807 --> 16:58.225
Do I have to stay?

16:59.059 --> 17:00.436
Am I under arrest?

17:00.644 --> 17:03.480
-No.
-Let me know when you find out who did it.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.316
I wanna pin a medal on her chest.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.367
-RITA: How was it?
-It could have gone better.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.786
-What do you got?
-I did a Web search on Byrd.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.788
I found this in a rape victims’ newsgroup.

17:22.624 --> 17:25.544
"I point my gun at his head
and pull its magic trigger,

17:25.627 --> 17:28.839
"watch the blood bloom,
see his sightless eyes staring up at me."

17:29.048 --> 17:30.716
"Lester Byrd, RIP."

17:30.799 --> 17:32.885
The screen name on the post is "Marksman."

17:32.968 --> 17:35.679
There’s a bunch like it,
all pretty much along the same lines.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.014
Any idea who it is?

17:37.097 --> 17:39.683
I put a call in to the website
service provider, but they’re gonna want

17:39.767 --> 17:41.185
a subpoena before they’ll give up a name.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.688
Tell ’em it’s a homicide investigation,
the subpoena’s on its way.

17:45.230 --> 17:48.484
Also, uh, we got an address
for Eliza Todd. She’s on Bleeker.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.652
-We’re gonna go talk to her.
-Sounds good.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.659
(SIGHS)

18:05.959 --> 18:07.336
-Cup?
-Yeah, thanks.

18:11.799 --> 18:15.052
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)
I saw one of the files on your desk.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.221
It was a case from 1989.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.474
You really that far behind on your fives?

18:26.688 --> 18:27.773
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:28.273 --> 18:31.944
Somebody snatched Theo up this mornin'.
That’s why he wasn’t at school.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.529
You said he was okay.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.989
All the guy did was drive him around
for a half an hour.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.408
You think it’s the same guy
that’s been pulling the other stunts?

18:38.534 --> 18:41.328
Yeah, and now he’s ramping it up.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.164
Plus,
he’s getting personal information about me

18:44.248 --> 18:47.209
-stuff that only my family should know.
-You look at Hatcher?

18:47.334 --> 18:48.627
He alibis out

18:48.794 --> 18:50.587
which doesn’t mean
he isn’t working with somebody.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.756
Now, you’re looking at the files
to check out other candidates.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.716
-Yeah.
-All right, what can I do?

18:55.384 --> 18:58.137
Detective Clark. Uh...
There are some people here to see you.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.931
-Who?
-Uh... They wouldn’t give their names.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.100
One of them says she’s a friend.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.901
-Hey, Johnny.
-Hey.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.737
-Is this a bad time?
-What do you mean?

19:15.904 --> 19:17.781
KELLY:
I’d like to turn myself in for murder.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.909
I... I wanna know. Is this a bad time?
(CHUCKLES)

19:21.994 --> 19:24.705
You said I should come by sometime.
Remember?

19:26.415 --> 19:27.791
Okay, right.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.419
Uh... Probably not a great time right now.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.004
-This is my friend Angela.
-Hi.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.547
Angela does party planning.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.048
-Oh, yeah?
-Planning and promotion.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.301
-JOHN: Oh.
-ANGELA: Kelly said you invited her to a…

19:37.384 --> 19:39.261
What do ya call it?
A racket at the American Legion Hall

19:39.428 --> 19:40.554
-in College Point?
-Did I do that?

19:40.637 --> 19:42.347
-Among other things.
-Yeah.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.142
ANGELA: College point? I have such
a much better venue than that,

19:45.267 --> 19:48.270
-if you’re ever interested.
-She’s the best too. I swear.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.231
Okay, uh, I... I kinda got
to get back to work now.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.400
-What about the tour?
-JOHN: Uh... Could we do it another time?

19:53.483 --> 19:55.485
I wanna see the rooms
where you make people confess.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.321
No, we got some things going on right now.

19:57.529 --> 20:01.658
-I... I could show ’em around if you want.
-Greg... Thanks.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.077
It’s probably n... not a good time.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.163
-Can we get a picture, at least?
-JOHN: Sure.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.375
ANDY: (CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.173
-(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
-Now, the three of us.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.300
Uh...

20:19.343 --> 20:21.345
-May I?
-Thank you.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.351
-Oh, this is a keeper.
-Take the picture, Greg.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.102
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

20:32.564 --> 20:34.816
Ms. Todd, have you had any contact
with Lester Byrd

20:34.900 --> 20:36.902
-since he got out of prison?
-ELIZA: God, no.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.697
-He’s really dead?
-LAURA: Yes.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.158
(SIGHS)

20:43.784 --> 20:45.869
I can’t tell you how many feelings
that brings up.

20:45.953 --> 20:50.123
-Have you discussed Byrd with anyone?
-My therapist. Some friends.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.585
-Hillary Blair?
-A few times. We’ve stayed in touch.

20:53.961 --> 20:57.798
-What does she have to say?
-About Byrd? She’s pretty angry.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.468
Not that Hillary said anything
about killing him.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.596
-Are you angry at Byrd?
-Well, anger doesn’t do me much good.

21:04.763 --> 21:08.183
I try to focus on acceptance
and getting on with my life.

21:08.350 --> 21:12.312
-Your husband feels the same way?
-I don’t have a husband. I’m a single mom.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.022
-RITA: Boyfriend?
-No.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.734
There’s something
you should probably know.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.320
My daughter was conceived
when I was raped.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.489
Lester Byrd is her father?

21:22.823 --> 21:26.326
I still have a hard time saying that...
but yes.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.579
The rape was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.540
But when I found out I was pregnant,

21:31.623 --> 21:35.127
it felt like I was being given a chance
to make some good of it.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.170
So, I took it.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.215
-That might seem strange to you.
-No.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.635
Ella’s a beautiful little girl.

21:44.594 --> 21:47.597
-Did Lester Byrd know he was the father?
-No.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.141
Did he say or do anything

21:49.349 --> 21:52.144
that made you think he’d be a threat
when he got out of jail?

21:53.770 --> 21:57.024
The only thing I remember him saying
was that he loved me.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.903
Oh, yes and that I loved him.
It was pathetic, really.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.615
So needy. Not that it seemed that way
at the time.

22:05.907 --> 22:09.328
We have to ask.
Where were you at 7:30 this morning?

22:10.078 --> 22:12.748
Ella stayed
at a friend’s last night so I slept in.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.375
-Meaning you were alone?
-Yes.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.173
-That was some story, huh?
-(SIGHS) Yeah.

22:22.466 --> 22:25.385
I’m sorry. Was that too personal?
Did I cross the line?

22:26.219 --> 22:27.721
Let’s head back to the squad.

22:28.805 --> 22:29.931
Sure.

22:38.398 --> 22:39.483
Fraker.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.527
(HESITATES) Ah...
Look what the cat dragged in.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.863
Big, fat, Polish rat.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.866
Pourin' drinks now, huh?
That’s a real step-up.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.660
A friend of mine runs the place.
I’m helpin' him out.

22:50.786 --> 22:54.664
Want a shot? Here, on the house.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.001
I want to ask you some questions.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.504
That right there
is all you’re gettin' from me.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.589
Where were you
at eight o'clock this morning?

23:02.756 --> 23:05.133
If you’re not gonna drink that,
you’re gonna have to leave.

23:05.258 --> 23:07.177
We don’t allow people to loiter.

23:08.261 --> 23:11.807
-Somebody’s comin' after me.
-Coming after you? How?

23:11.932 --> 23:16.645
-If it’s you, be a man and admit it.
-(SCOFFS) Why would I come after you?

23:16.812 --> 23:20.023
All you did was lie about me
under oath and ruin my career.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.733
Is it you? Yes or no.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.112
At 8:00 this morning,
I was helping unload a shipment of liquor.

23:25.278 --> 23:28.031
You don’t believe me, talk to the guy
who made the delivery.

23:28.532 --> 23:31.410
Of course, that doesn’t mean
I don’t have an accomplice.

23:32.494 --> 23:35.622
You don’t wanna piss me off
any more than I already am, Fraker.

23:35.997 --> 23:39.000
Lay a finger on me, I’m gonna sue you
for every penny you got.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.044
-You and the police department.
-You’re smashed.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.505
-You wish.
-I can smell it on you.

23:44.297 --> 23:47.384
Salesman came in with a new scotch.
We sampled it.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.888
On the house.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.100
Sipowicz...

23:56.268 --> 23:59.896
What goes around comes around.
Think about it.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.626
Andy...

24:23.962 --> 24:28.800
Here. Richard Lockier.
You put him away for armed robbery in ’86.

24:28.967 --> 24:31.803
-What about him?
-Well, he was paroled three years ago.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.764
Apparently, he lives in your neighborhood,
like, a couple of blocks away.

24:34.931 --> 24:38.393
-News to me.
-He had a real hard-on for you, didn’t he?

24:38.477 --> 24:40.604
Theo walks past this building
on his way to school.

24:40.687 --> 24:42.981
Well, the address is two years old.
I’ll keep looking into it.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.358
Thanks, Medavoy. Appreciate it.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.654
That was the Internet service provider.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.740
Marksman is the screen name
for Eliza Todd.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.116
I’m thinking she didn’t mention it

24:53.200 --> 24:55.035
-when you talked to her earlier.
-LAURA: No, she didn’t.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.579
(HESITATES) Well, we’ll bring her in.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.665
Don’t forget to get a hall pass
from the teacher first.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.001
Oh, yeah.

25:06.671 --> 25:09.257
"I hold the gun in my hand.
It looks like a metal fist."

25:09.341 --> 25:11.843
"I imagine pulling the trigger
and the beautiful explosion,

25:11.927 --> 25:15.096
"relief and release shootin' out
into Byrd’s body."

25:15.680 --> 25:19.684
-Did you write this?
-God, this is embarrassing. Uh... Yes.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.687
It’s just fantasy, that’s all.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.272
Cheap therapy. (CHUCKLES)

25:25.148 --> 25:27.943
A way of dealing
with some very strong feelings

25:28.193 --> 25:31.112
I thought anonymously, but clearly not.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.490
(SCOFFS) There are a lot of posts here.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.409
I thought I was okay
while Byrd was in prison.

25:36.493 --> 25:39.162
But when he got out,
a lot of anger came up.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.289
That was just my way of dealing with it.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.292
-So, it isn’t true?
-None of it.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.878
-BALDWIN: You don’t own a gun?
-Absolutely not.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.589
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Uh... I’ve just written about it.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.508
Um... Is there anything else?

25:51.758 --> 25:54.719
My daughter’s gonna be home
from school soon. I need to get back.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.764
Ms. Todd,
we’re gonna have to search your apartment.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.808
For God’s sakes, why?

25:59.891 --> 26:01.643
Because these make it sound
like you have a gun.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.937
-Well, I just told you.
-We’ll need to check.

26:04.271 --> 26:07.607
You can’t. I mean it.
I... I won’t allow it.

26:07.691 --> 26:11.903
-Oh, we can get a search warrant.
-So if you do own a gun, tell us now.

26:12.195 --> 26:15.240
’Cause if you say you don’t
and we find one, it’ll be bad for you.

26:16.783 --> 26:19.077
-Yes, I have a gun.
-Where is it?

26:19.327 --> 26:23.873
(INHALES) It’s in a can, over the stove
on the top shelf.

26:24.332 --> 26:27.168
It’s got a trigger lock on it.
I never used it for anything.

26:27.502 --> 26:31.172
-Well, when did you get it?
-When I heard Byrd was gonna be released.

26:32.757 --> 26:36.928
This irrational fear just took hold of me.
I had to do something.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.473
-Is it registered?
-No.

26:41.725 --> 26:44.352
I bought it from somebody
I don’t really know.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.981
-It’s illegal for me to have it, isn’t it?
-Yes.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.858
I never even fired it.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.360
We’ll test it.
If you’re tellin' the truth, we’ll know.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.864
-Are you gonna arrest me?
-Well, let’s take this one step at a time.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.657
My daughter’s gonna be home soon.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.701
I need to bring her
over to the neighbor's.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.037
Okay, but, uh, you’ll be
coming back here with us.

27:02.162 --> 27:03.413
ELIZA: I understand.

27:08.209 --> 27:11.463
-(TELEPHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

27:12.213 --> 27:14.341
-THOMAS: She go for the gun?
-Yeah, we’re gonna pick it up.

27:14.424 --> 27:17.052
-Baldwin’s taking her down in the car.
-What about the shooting?

27:17.177 --> 27:19.971
-Says she has nothin' to do with it.
-Do you believe her?

27:20.347 --> 27:23.975
Well, she doesn’t seem like the kind
to put three into a guy, but who knows?

27:24.059 --> 27:27.270
Well, we got her either way, if not
for the murder, then the weapons charge.

27:27.395 --> 27:29.814
You’re gonna stick her with the gun charge
even if she didn’t kill Byrd?

27:29.981 --> 27:32.275
-THOMAS: That’s right.
-She got raped.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.986
If all she did was get a gun
to protect herself in her own home,

27:35.070 --> 27:36.196
why put her away?

27:36.321 --> 27:39.783
If the gun’s illegal,
she goes into the system. Next question?

27:40.033 --> 27:42.327
Boss, crime scene found a bar tab
in Byrd’s trash.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.121
It’s dated last night.
I thought we’d talk to the bartender,

27:45.205 --> 27:47.540
-find out if he saw anything.
-Why don’t you do that?

27:51.961 --> 27:54.047
-Don’t do me any favors.
-RITA: Like?

27:54.172 --> 27:57.008
Like changing the topic
when I’m getting into it with the boss.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.887
You’re not gonna get anywhere arguing
with the guy. He just digs in his heels.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.305
I’ll be downstairs.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.153
-Detectives.
-(BILLIARD BALLS CLACKING)

28:17.320 --> 28:20.031
-What can I do for you?
-Do you know somebody named Lester Byrd?

28:20.615 --> 28:23.201
-Sorry.
-You recognize this picture?

28:26.121 --> 28:28.164
-Nope.
-LAURA: he was in here last night.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.667
-We get a lot of people.
-I bet you do.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.671
That sheet back there,
is that for gambling?

28:35.004 --> 28:36.339
That’s illegal, isn’t it?

28:38.049 --> 28:39.551
Let me take another look.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.264
Yeah, he was in here,
but I don’t know his name.

28:44.431 --> 28:47.684
-What’d he do?
-Sat by himself, nursed a couple beers...

28:47.809 --> 28:50.895
-(FANFARE PLAYING)
-Made a bunch of calls at the pay phone.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.648
-Anything else?
-Another guy came in later.

28:53.815 --> 28:56.234
-Looked like they were arguing.
-Could you hear what they said?

28:56.484 --> 28:59.779
-No, but it was pretty intense.
-What did the second man look like?

28:59.946 --> 29:03.575
White. Bulked up. Lot of tattoos.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.285
-On his neck?
-Yeah.

29:05.827 --> 29:09.372
He didn’t stay long. He got up and left
after about ten minutes.

29:09.539 --> 29:10.707
Looked pissed off.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.545
LAURA: Deroche’s foreman said
he was on the job

29:15.628 --> 29:18.256
-when Byrd got killed, right?
-Worth having another talk with him.

29:18.339 --> 29:21.217
BARTENDER: Hey.
sorry about sayin' I didn’t know the guy.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.220
I get in the middle of things,
and it’s just trouble.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.973
Yeah,
thanks for summonin' up your courage.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.146
Just a couple of things
we need to clarify, Mr. Pines.

29:33.313 --> 29:36.107
Look, is this gonna take long?
I still gotta clean up the site.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.818
When we talked earlier,
you said Drew Deroche came in

29:38.902 --> 29:40.737
-this morning around 7:00?
-Yeah.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.113
You sure about that?

29:43.198 --> 29:45.200
Yeah. Pretty sure.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.453
There’s a security camera in the lobby
of the building that you’re working in.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.790
We’re gettin' the tape pulled to see
when he actually came in this morning.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.959
So, if you wanna reconsider your story,
now would be the time.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.419
(SIGHS)

29:58.254 --> 30:00.256
It might have been a little later.

30:00.757 --> 30:04.177
-(INHALES) How much later?
-8:00, 8:30.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.887
Why’d you lie, Mr. Pines?

30:06.054 --> 30:08.097
Before I say anything more,
we gotta talk protection.

30:08.181 --> 30:11.643
-Who did you need protection from?
-It’s not me. It’s my nephew, Ben.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.354
He’s in the Clinton Correctional Facility.
He’s a good boy.

30:14.437 --> 30:16.314
Just... just screwed up a little is all.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.650
-Does he know Deroche?
-Can you protect him?

30:18.733 --> 30:20.318
If it’s necessary.

30:23.947 --> 30:25.114
(SIGHS)

30:26.324 --> 30:27.784
Deroche came to me and said

30:27.867 --> 30:30.119
if I didn’t give him a job on my crew,
that Ben could get hurt.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.373
I checked with Ben, Ben said
that he had a lot of pull on the inside,

30:33.456 --> 30:35.750
had a lot of friends,
and that I should do whatever he said.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.710
How long has Deroche been working for you?

30:37.877 --> 30:39.337
Working? That’s generous.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.799
He collects a paycheck,
shows up now and then.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.551
What'd he say,
why he was late this morning?

30:44.676 --> 30:47.220
Just that if anybody asks,
I should say he was there at 7:00.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.973
Well, did he ever mention
the name, uh, Lester Byrd?

30:50.098 --> 30:51.182
No.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.768
-Do you know where he is right now?
-No.

30:54.143 --> 30:57.021
He never came back to the site
after you guys picked him up this morning.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.150
Am I in trouble for lying?

31:01.401 --> 31:03.945
No. We understand you were trying
to protect your nephew.

31:04.070 --> 31:07.282
-And you’re gonna help him?
-(SIGHS) If your story holds,

31:07.365 --> 31:09.242
we’ll see that he’s moved
to a different facility.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.453
-Got a minute?
-Yeah.

31:13.496 --> 31:14.539
You can go. Thank you.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.462
RITA: I tried Deroche’s home number.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.006
He wasn’t there,
but I talked to his mother.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.007
JOHN: Yeah? What’d she say?

31:24.132 --> 31:26.426
He’s doing everything right,
doesn’t wanna violate his parole.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.760
I sweet-talked her a little.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.054
She admitted he was having
adjustment problems.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.389
BALDWIN: Did she say what those were?

31:31.556 --> 31:33.600
It sounds like
he’s having trouble keeping a girlfriend.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.685
-Adjustment problems?
-That’s what she called it.

31:35.852 --> 31:39.063
She said he’s usually home by 5:00.
I’ve got Anti-crime sittin' on the house.

31:39.147 --> 31:42.567
Mm. All right, now,
we should talk to, uh, this Ben Pines.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.736
Uh... Bale mentioned he’d like an update.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.946
Well, why not?
It’s been ten minutes since the last one.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.781
You know what? This is gettin' really old.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.325
Adjustment problems.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.547
-I need an assurance.
-Ben, we got you down

32:04.631 --> 32:07.800
-to Rikers fast enough, didn’t we?
-I need assurance I ain’t goin’ back,

32:07.967 --> 32:11.012
not to Clinton. I’m there
when Drew finds out I talked to you, man,

32:11.095 --> 32:13.473
I’m ground beef,
and they gon' serve me for dinner.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.475
Look, you help us out,
you got nothin' to worry about.

32:15.558 --> 32:18.436
-You got our word on that.
-You’re gonna leave my uncle alone, right?

32:18.603 --> 32:20.396
I mean,
he’s just been watching out for me.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.066
-Yeah, he’s not in any trouble.
-Now, what do you know about Drew?

32:23.816 --> 32:25.860
Well, we worked in the library together.

32:26.569 --> 32:29.781
That’s where I told him about my uncle...
(SCOFFS) ...which was stupid.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.868
We hear he was pretty hard-core.
He hurt you?

32:34.953 --> 32:38.539
No. But I’ve seen him hurt plenty.
You can believe that.

32:38.665 --> 32:42.543
-Well, how well do you know Lester Byrd?
-Not Lester, but Leslie.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.837
That’s how we knew him.

32:45.254 --> 32:47.465
Drew and Leslie were a couple?

32:47.632 --> 32:50.259
Drew picked him out as soon
as he came up on the block.

32:50.885 --> 32:55.056
-Les was a baby. You know, soft.
-So, Deroche punked him out?

32:55.139 --> 32:58.142
Les was his boy. He ran errands for him.

32:58.226 --> 33:01.104
He brought him food.
Sometimes Drew loaned Les out

33:01.187 --> 33:03.398
to other guys for favors, you know?

33:05.149 --> 33:06.192
It’s life on the block.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.444
Well, how did Les take to that?

33:08.987 --> 33:12.991
Not so bad. (CHUCKLES)
They got to be this, like, couple.

33:13.241 --> 33:17.120
Drew, he’d look out for Les.
Les, he learned how to sew.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.248
Made his own clothes,
like chick clothes, you know?

33:20.581 --> 33:22.834
Came to be,
if you looked at Les the wrong way,

33:22.917 --> 33:26.295
-Drew'd come after you.
-What happened when Drew got out?

33:26.921 --> 33:29.966
I don’t know.
But I heard he wasn’t taking Les’s calls.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.635
Les was pretty upset, I know that.

33:35.179 --> 33:37.056
-You think Drew killed him?
-We’re looking into it.

33:38.307 --> 33:40.977
We’re also working on getting you moved
to a different facility.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.478
Oh, please.

33:48.484 --> 33:50.445
-I thought we covered everything.
-BALDWIN: Sit down.

33:57.035 --> 34:00.204
Yeah, Byrd must have cleaned up
pretty good when he wanted to.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.250
And what does that mean?

34:04.375 --> 34:07.462
Well, he had
those high cheekbones, full lips.

34:08.337 --> 34:10.506
When he put on tight pants
and a sexy blouse...

34:10.673 --> 34:14.427
-Whew! Boy, he must have been a babe.
-I don’t think of hes as babes.

34:14.510 --> 34:17.889
We know you two were a couple, Drew.
Everyone in prison knew it.

34:19.307 --> 34:21.559
Inside’s inside. Rules are different.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.436
-A babe’s a babe.
-What’s with this guy?

34:23.644 --> 34:26.439
Hey, man, there’s no shame in it,
you found another man attractive.

34:26.522 --> 34:28.483
-DREW: No, I didn’t!
-Do you find me attractive?

34:28.566 --> 34:30.276
Don’t take this the wrong way,
but no, I don’t.

34:30.359 --> 34:31.944
-BALDWIN: Well, why not?
-You’re a guy.

34:32.028 --> 34:33.988
-Byrd was a guy.
-I didn’t find him attractive either.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.532
Oh, so... so, the whole time
you were bangin' him,

34:36.616 --> 34:37.867
you were pretending he was a woman?

34:38.034 --> 34:40.411
-That’s right.
-And as soon as you got out of prison,

34:40.495 --> 34:41.829
and you could be with an actual woman,

34:42.038 --> 34:43.372
-then you wouldn’t go near him.
-Right.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.249
-You have sex with him since you been out?
-No.

34:45.374 --> 34:46.793
-JOHN: You’re lying.
-No, I’m not lying!

34:46.918 --> 34:48.836
-You couldn’t stay away!
-DREW: That’s not true.

34:48.961 --> 34:51.547
-Oh, you were with him last night.
-I ran into him and we...

34:51.631 --> 34:53.007
talked for a little bit, and that was it.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.634
JOHN: People will think you two
were a couple

34:54.759 --> 34:57.053
-when they’d see you. Wouldn’t they?
-I don’t care what people think!

34:57.220 --> 34:59.388
Yeah, you do. A big tough guy like you?

34:59.555 --> 35:02.058
And in the eyes of the world,
you’re no different than Lester.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.895
-He wouldn’t stop though, would he?
-I asked him to.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.941
-I asked him to help me.
-Did you go to his apartment this morning?

35:10.566 --> 35:11.609
(SCOFFS)

35:11.818 --> 35:16.656
He said that he was mine and I was his,
and that we were stuck with each other.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.909
-The little runt.
-What happened in the apartment?

35:21.244 --> 35:22.370
Pranced around...

35:23.454 --> 35:26.958
-Looked at me with those eyes.
-It doesn’t matter the circumstances.

35:27.083 --> 35:30.336
You fall in love with somebody,
that’s not something you can shake.

35:31.712 --> 35:33.339
He made me breakfast.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.217
And when I finished eatin',
I went over to the sink

35:36.342 --> 35:37.718
where he was doin' the dishes.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.179
Picked him up,
and I carried him over to the bed.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.557
(SNIFFLES) I kissed him.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.685
I told him I loved him.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.273
God help me.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.942
(BREATHES DEEPLY) I shot him.

36:04.036 --> 36:06.122
-He go for it?
-Yeah, he’s writin' it up now.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.373
THOMAS: I talked to corrections.

36:07.540 --> 36:10.042
-Ben Pine’s on his way up to Coxsackie.
-Glad to hear it.

36:10.126 --> 36:13.004
For what it’s worth, ballistics
came back negative for Eliza Todd’s gun.

36:13.546 --> 36:16.549
-Big surprise.
-I talked to the DA's office.

36:16.632 --> 36:18.843
-They’re movin' ahead with the case.
-Lieu...

36:19.385 --> 36:20.469
THOMAS: Yeah?

36:20.678 --> 36:22.388
I’m wondering
if you’ll reconsider this one.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.974
Todd was scared. She did a stupid thing.
Nobody got hurt.

36:25.099 --> 36:26.684
She probably would've thrown the gun away.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.979
-You’re confident about that?
-Point being, we got the gun.

36:30.062 --> 36:32.440
She can’t do anything with it.
Why put her away?

36:32.607 --> 36:34.150
Because the gun’s illegal.

36:34.317 --> 36:37.945
And if this were a 20-year-old Black kid,
we wouldn’t be having this conversation

36:38.070 --> 36:40.406
because you’d already be
takin' him downtown.

36:42.450 --> 36:43.784
(DOOR CLOSING)

36:45.203 --> 36:47.538
-Thanks for backing me up.
-Let’s go tell her.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.764
-How’s it going?
-I’m nowhere.

37:05.848 --> 37:09.435
I sent some pictures over to Connie,
Hatcher, Fraker, a few others.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.395
Theo didn’t pick any of ’em out.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.150
-So, what are you doing?
-Going through my files,

37:16.275 --> 37:18.402
putting together
a list of people that hate me.

37:19.987 --> 37:22.531
(CLEARS THROAT)
Medavoy’s running some of the names.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.034
-I could run some names.
-No, it’s covered.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.121
-Something else I can do?
-(SIGHS)

37:30.748 --> 37:33.042
Look, Andy, I know it’s been bad
between us the last few days,

37:33.125 --> 37:34.961
but if you got a problem,
then I wanna help.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.047
-Tell me what I can do to help.
-(SIGHS)

37:40.049 --> 37:42.927
-I can’t trust you with this, John.
-What do you mean?

37:43.135 --> 37:47.807
Your head’s someplace else.
This is my family. I can’t risk it.

37:47.890 --> 37:48.933
(SCOFFS)

37:49.976 --> 37:51.811
It seems to me like I’m getting
the job done.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.188
Most of the days,
you’re half asleep and hungover.

37:54.313 --> 37:56.315
It seems to me like I closed a case today.

37:56.482 --> 37:58.442
In between visits from your girlfriends.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.569
All right, is that what this...
Come on, Andy.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.113
I didn’t ask those girls to come here.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.532
They wouldn’t have come
if you hadn’t talked them up in a bar.

38:04.657 --> 38:07.326
Oh, you’re telling me
that you never talked a girl up in a bar?

38:07.410 --> 38:08.494
Yeah, I did.

38:09.704 --> 38:10.663
(SIGHING)

38:12.290 --> 38:16.043
You gotta get your head
back on straight, John. Until then...

38:17.128 --> 38:18.337
I can’t trust you.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.302
(SIGHS)

38:38.983 --> 38:42.486
Did you submit a five saying
you advised Eliza Todd of her rights

38:42.653 --> 38:44.071
after she told you about the gun?

38:44.280 --> 38:47.325
-(SIGHS) I guess I did.
-That was the district attorney.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.660
Todd’s lawyer’s screaming,
"The gun’s inadmissible."

38:49.952 --> 38:51.370
They’re gonna kick the case.

38:51.704 --> 38:54.248
-I’m sorry, Lieu. I made a mistake.
-THOMAS: A mistake!

38:54.332 --> 38:56.208
How many times have you advise someone
of their rights

38:56.292 --> 38:58.336
-before you read their statement?
-Almost never.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.421
And how many times
do you admit it on the five?

39:00.629 --> 39:01.797
(SIGHS) Almost never.

39:02.048 --> 39:04.884
But this time you did. Why is that?

39:05.259 --> 39:07.803
(SIGHS)
Like I said, Lieu, it was a mistake.

39:08.804 --> 39:12.058
Everybody gets one mistake.
That was yours.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.394
And I thought you were better than that.

39:15.561 --> 39:16.687
ANDY: Listen, Lieutenant.

39:16.854 --> 39:20.232
Why don’t you just admit
locking the girl up was a bad call?

39:21.567 --> 39:26.364
-I didn’t see any fives on my desk today.
-Some personal business got in the way.

39:26.697 --> 39:29.241
Then you can take today
against your lost time,

39:29.367 --> 39:31.035
and tomorrow you can work your cases

39:31.202 --> 39:33.371
and get those fives on my desk
by the end of the day

39:33.537 --> 39:34.872
or you’re walkin'.

39:37.750 --> 39:38.959
Good night.

39:50.513 --> 39:54.308
I just got a call.
Richard Lockier died a year ago, cancer.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.602
Thanks for looking into it, Medavoy.

39:56.977 --> 39:59.522
-GREG: Uh... I can run some more names.
-That’s okay.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.107
Anything I can do.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.609
I’ll see you tomorrow, Andy.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.202
-GREG: Good night.
-LAURA: Good night, Greg.

-Hey.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.128
-Headin' home?
-RITA: Yeah.

40:23.462 --> 40:26.132
(SIGHS) What you did today,
that was a good thing.

40:26.799 --> 40:29.468
That woman didn’t belong in the system.
Anyone could see that.

40:30.177 --> 40:33.222
-Bale didn’t.
-I happened to get the fives.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.349
You’d have done the same thing
if you’d had the chance.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.143
Yeah, but the point is, you did it.

40:37.685 --> 40:41.439
You took the risk.
That meant something to everybody.

40:44.483 --> 40:45.901
I feel like we worked ourselves

40:45.985 --> 40:48.904
into a bad place pretty quickly,
and I don’t like it.

40:49.989 --> 40:51.323
Could we start over?

40:51.615 --> 40:54.201
-Make tomorrow day one?
-Along those lines.

40:54.994 --> 40:55.995
I’d like that.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.205
-Cool. I’ll see you tomorrow.
-RITA: Yeah.

41:18.058 --> 41:21.020
-Hey, what’s up, kiddo?
-I had a nightmare.

41:21.979 --> 41:22.980
What happened?

41:23.355 --> 41:26.442
-Somebody was chasing me.
-Oh, you know who it was?

41:27.943 --> 41:29.528
(YAWNS) He didn’t have a face.

Come here.

was pretty scary, huh, pal?

41:38.787 --> 41:39.830
Yeah.

41:40.206 --> 41:41.540
It won’t happen again.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.002
Why did that man take me in his car?

41:45.377 --> 41:48.422
Ah... It’s like he was playing
a trick on me.

41:49.256 --> 41:52.843
-You mean, like a joke?
-Yep, like a... like a joke.

-Can I stay out here for a few minutes?
-You bet, squirt.
