WEBVTT

00:03.792 --> 00:04.750
Looking forward to it.

00:05.250 --> 00:07.417
Okay. See you then, buddy.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.083
Clump nugget!

00:11.458 --> 00:14.041
- Who's a clump nugget?
- Oh, Mike Gogan.

00:14.125 --> 00:16.750
Uh-oh, must be time
for bowling with the Gogan's.

00:17.208 --> 00:18.625
Don't you mean losing to the Gogan's?

00:18.709 --> 00:21.458
Hey, come on,
let's have a positive attitude.

00:21.542 --> 00:24.208
I mean, sure we've lost
to them five years in a row,

00:24.291 --> 00:28.166
and sure we've never come within 50 pins.

00:28.250 --> 00:31.166
Sure. Dad gives the worst pep talks
in history.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.959
Hey, that's not the way winners talk.

00:33.083 --> 00:36.041
Mom, if I knew how winners talked,
my name would be Teddy Gogan.

00:38.208 --> 00:40.500
Well now, I don't know
if I ever told you kids this,

00:40.750 --> 00:43.959
but I was the star of the Southwest
Denver Community College

00:44.041 --> 00:45.583
women's bowling team.

00:46.375 --> 00:50.000
You were?
Oh, gee, I'd love to hear about that.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.959
Seems like you were on every club
and team at that school.

00:56.041 --> 00:57.250
How did you have time for classes?

00:57.333 --> 00:59.000
I'm not even sure that school had classes.

00:59.083 --> 01:00.625
To me, it was more of an activity center.

01:01.959 --> 01:04.291
Hey, Dad, I'm sorry to say this,

01:04.375 --> 01:06.709
but I think I'm too busy
for bowling this year.

01:06.792 --> 01:08.208
Oh, man.

01:08.291 --> 01:10.166
I was thinking Gabe could replace me.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.458
Okay, I guess we'll just muddle through,

01:12.542 --> 01:14.375
but believe me, you're gonna be missed.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.125
Thanks for understanding.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.125
Thanks, guys.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.875
Yes! We finally have a chance to win!

01:25.458 --> 01:26.709
Yeah!
Amy: Whoah!

01:32.250 --> 01:34.125
Why are your arms in the air?

01:35.250 --> 01:36.375
We're...

01:37.542 --> 01:38.625
stretching.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.250
Why are you stretching?

01:42.750 --> 01:45.625
Because we're happy
you're not bowling this year.

I'm sorry, Teddy. I just love that song.
It always moves me.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.959
Can it move you right out of the room?

03:30.125 --> 03:31.291
Why are you recording it?

03:31.375 --> 03:33.792
It's for this contest we saw online.
The winner gets a car.

03:33.875 --> 03:36.917
And the winner also gets
to sing the national anthem

03:37.000 --> 03:38.375
at a Denver nuggets game.

03:38.458 --> 03:39.875
And they win a car.

03:41.542 --> 03:43.417
Well, good luck.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.250
I sure do love that song.

03:46.333 --> 03:49.917
Yeah, you know, Mrs. Wentz,
I'd suggest that you enter the contest,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.083
but I wanna win a car.

03:52.542 --> 03:55.500
T, my mom's not interested.

03:55.583 --> 03:56.875
Who said I'm not interested?

03:58.166 --> 03:59.917
You know, when I was younger,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.917
it was my dream
to become a professional singer.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.750
Really? What happened?

04:05.166 --> 04:08.291
Oh, I got married, then we had Ivy.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.834
So, you're blaming me?
I killed your dreams?

04:12.709 --> 04:15.875
Of course not, sweetie.
It was you and your father.

04:19.750 --> 04:23.000
You know, if we both entered,
we'd have two chances to win.

04:23.083 --> 04:26.750
I would love to enter the contest, Teddy,
but I don't need another car.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.333
Exactly. If I win, I get the car.

04:29.417 --> 04:31.375
If you win, I get the car.

04:34.250 --> 04:36.041
- I could use a car.
- Stay out of this.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.500
Hey, mom, whatcha doing?

04:44.583 --> 04:47.917
Well, guess who just joined
her very first social network?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.709
That's right. I'm on buddy page.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.959
So buddy page is officially
not cool anymore.

04:56.041 --> 04:57.625
- What?
- Nothing.

04:58.917 --> 05:01.125
Okay, so if you ever wanna
send me a message, ims,

05:01.208 --> 05:02.542
whatevs, just hit me up.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.709
Ooh, look who else is on here--

05:06.792 --> 05:07.875
Grandma!

05:09.834 --> 05:11.792
Yep, definitely gotta delete my account.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.667
"Buddy suggestion-- PJ Duncan."

05:15.750 --> 05:18.083
I don't know. Should I be buddies with PJ?

05:18.166 --> 05:19.583
Oh, he would love that.

05:20.458 --> 05:21.542
Yeah, and after we're buddies,

05:21.625 --> 05:23.583
I could post one of his baby
pictures on his page.

05:23.917 --> 05:26.875
Why post one when you can post them all?

05:27.458 --> 05:30.333
Aah, that is a cute one.

05:31.208 --> 05:34.834
Okay, "send PJ Duncan a buddy request."
Let's do it, Charlie.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.583
Okay, hit that button right there.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.917
"Sent." Ha-ha!
Good job, Charlie. You did it.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.917
Hey. New buddy request.

05:44.417 --> 05:45.917
From...

05:47.083 --> 05:48.041
Mom.

05:49.208 --> 05:51.125
No thank you.

06:01.208 --> 06:02.542
Oh, you're never gonna believe this.

06:02.625 --> 06:05.000
- What?
- Mary Lou: Yay! Whoo!

06:05.083 --> 06:06.917
I won the contest!

06:07.000 --> 06:08.291
Is that what you were gonna say?

06:08.417 --> 06:12.083
No. I was gonna say I won a car!

06:12.166 --> 06:13.917
Both:

06:14.000 --> 06:16.333
Whoo! I've got to figure out what to wear!

06:18.458 --> 06:20.000
Isn't it great?

06:20.083 --> 06:21.166
Sure, for now.

06:21.542 --> 06:23.667
"For now"? What's that supposed to mean?

06:23.750 --> 06:26.709
T, you don't know my mom.
Something always goes wrong.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.875
My Dad and I call it "the blip."

06:29.333 --> 06:31.083
- The blip?
- Yeah,

06:31.166 --> 06:34.709
with Mary Lou Wentz,
there's always a blip.

06:35.208 --> 06:37.583
I've got it!

06:37.667 --> 06:42.875
I'll wear an American flag dress
and a red, white and blue hat

06:42.959 --> 06:44.333
with sparklers on top.

06:47.917 --> 06:49.583
So, is that the blip?

06:49.959 --> 06:51.542
No, that's just crazy.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.250
All right, practice time.
Let's see what you got.

07:05.041 --> 07:07.208
- Oh, yes!
- Yeah!

07:07.250 --> 07:08.917
- Yeah!
- Bob:

07:09.959 --> 07:12.125
Ah, great. Here comes Mike Gogan.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.166
And I'll be in the arcade.

07:15.333 --> 07:18.125
- Bob!
- Hey, Mike!

07:18.208 --> 07:21.834
Always a pleasure beating you.
I mean, meeting you.

07:21.917 --> 07:23.834
No, I mean beating you.

07:25.875 --> 07:27.875
Well, Mike, if you're so sure
you're gonna beat us,

07:27.959 --> 07:29.417
what say we make this interesting?

07:29.500 --> 07:30.917
Say 50 bucks.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.041
- Let's make it 100.
- Let's make it 500.

07:33.125 --> 07:34.291
Let's make it 1,000.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.250
- Let's go back to 50.
- Deal.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.542
Gabe, let's go.

07:49.625 --> 07:51.709
In a minute. Gotta get the mystery box.

07:51.792 --> 07:54.625
- What's in it?
- Let me repeat the name.

07:54.917 --> 07:56.458
Mystery box.

07:57.792 --> 08:00.333
You know it's probably something stupid
like a whistle.

08:00.458 --> 08:01.333
A whistle?

08:02.500 --> 08:05.333
Dad, I know a kid from school
that knows a kid

08:05.417 --> 08:07.875
whose cousin won a mystery box.

08:07.959 --> 08:11.125
And do you wanna know what was in it?
An MP3 player.

08:11.208 --> 08:15.250
Yeah? Well, I know a kid who has a dad
who doesn't care.

08:15.333 --> 08:16.291
Let's go.

08:24.834 --> 08:26.417
- Hey, mom.
- Hey, PJ, you know what?

08:26.500 --> 08:28.625
You must have hit the wrong key
on your buddy page

08:28.709 --> 08:31.125
because you accidentally declined
my buddy request.

08:31.208 --> 08:32.458
Oh, no, I meant to do that.

08:33.792 --> 08:34.792
What?

08:35.667 --> 08:37.917
You don't wanna be my buddy? Why not?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.542
Mom, I really love you,
but it's kind of lame.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.834
See, buddy page is for interacting
with my friends

08:44.917 --> 08:47.458
and cute girls who would
never otherwise talk to me.

08:48.458 --> 08:51.959
Okay, it's lame to be buddies
with the woman who gave birth to you?

08:52.041 --> 08:52.917
Now you're getting it.

08:53.917 --> 08:56.458
Wha-- But, PJ, if we're buddies,

08:56.542 --> 08:58.959
we can post fun stuff on each other's page

08:59.041 --> 09:01.125
and then I can find out
about what's going on in your life.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.500
You are so good at explaining
why this is a bad idea. Thank you.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.625
- Hey, Charlie?
- Yeah?

09:11.709 --> 09:14.750
If you were on buddy page,
you'd be my buddy, wouldn't you?

09:14.834 --> 09:15.917
No, mama.

09:22.667 --> 09:25.667
Here I come!

09:29.375 --> 09:32.750
Wow! Mrs. Wentz, that is quite an outfit.

09:32.834 --> 09:35.792
Wait till you see the hat.
The batteries are still charging.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.041
How's my face? Do I look okay?

09:39.125 --> 09:42.375
Oh, yeah, you look great.
I can't wait to see you on the jumbotron.

09:42.458 --> 09:43.542
Jumbo-what?

09:44.166 --> 09:46.000
The giant screen at the arena.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.375
How else are 20,000 fans
gonna be able to see you?

09:49.458 --> 09:50.667
Twenty thousand?

09:52.542 --> 09:54.583
All looking at me?

09:55.625 --> 09:58.750
- Are you okay, mom?
- I did not think this through.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.667
Why are you putting down your purse?

10:00.750 --> 10:03.750
Because I'm staying here
where there is no jumbotron.

10:03.834 --> 10:06.208
- You're not going?
- No, I am not.

10:06.291 --> 10:10.709
No, okay, it's totally normal
to be a little bit nervous.

10:10.792 --> 10:13.417
So what we're gonna do
is we're gonna drive to the arena.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.041
You're gonna sing the song.

10:15.125 --> 10:17.458
I'm gonna win a car.
Everyone's gonna be happy.

10:17.542 --> 10:20.375
Whoa! No.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.917
- That was the sound of a lock, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.041
- She's not coming out, is she?
- No, she's not.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.333
- Blip?
- Blip.

10:33.583 --> 10:36.542
- Mrs. Wentz, you wanna come out now?
- Mary Lou: No, thank you.

10:40.166 --> 10:42.625
If you don't come out,
your dream won't come true.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.583
Mary Lou: The dream where you get a car?

10:47.500 --> 10:49.291
Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

10:52.041 --> 10:53.083
Ivy, say something.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.000
Can't blame this one
on me and Dad, can you?

10:59.166 --> 11:02.041
Oh, okay, Mrs. Wentz,

11:02.125 --> 11:04.500
you made a commitment

11:04.583 --> 11:07.166
to show up and sing the national anthem.

11:07.291 --> 11:11.041
Now you are refusing
to honor that commitment

11:11.125 --> 11:13.750
to our nation,
the United States of America.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.792
Now is that what you wanna do?

11:15.875 --> 11:17.917
Let down the entire country?

11:18.709 --> 11:19.750
Mary Lou: Okay.

11:30.083 --> 11:31.166
Hey, mom, how you doing?

11:33.458 --> 11:36.041
To be honest, I'm kind of upset.

11:36.125 --> 11:38.125
Great, great.
Wanna hand me that remote?

11:42.875 --> 11:45.875
PJ Rejected me . as a buddy on buddy page.

11:46.291 --> 11:47.875
Makes me think he's hiding something.

11:47.959 --> 11:50.166
He's a teenager.
Of course he's hiding something.

11:53.834 --> 11:56.250
Not like us preteens. We're an open book.

12:00.375 --> 12:04.000
I wish there was some way
I could view his buddy page.

12:04.375 --> 12:08.417
There is. I could confirm you as a buddy
and since I'm PJ'S buddy,

12:08.500 --> 12:10.625
you'd be able to look at his page
and he'll never know.

12:10.709 --> 12:12.333
You would do that for me?

12:12.417 --> 12:17.458
Sure, I'll just delete some things,
confirm you, and you're all set.

12:19.750 --> 12:23.458
It is so nice having a child
who will help me spy on my other children.

12:24.250 --> 12:29.000
I can't take all the credit.
I had to get my evil genes from someone.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.875
Awww!

12:32.583 --> 12:35.208
Mary Lou Wentz, I am done fooling around.

12:35.291 --> 12:39.959
Now I want you to unlock that door
and get your butt in the car now!

12:40.041 --> 12:43.875
Mary Lou:
Teddy, that's funny. Do it again.

12:45.792 --> 12:47.417
It was pretty good.

12:49.709 --> 12:51.291
You know what? I give up.

12:51.375 --> 12:52.750
Mary Lou: I'm sorry, Teddy.

12:52.834 --> 12:55.375
I just can't sing
in front of all those people.

12:58.375 --> 13:01.542
Wait, what if you didn't have to sing
in front of all those people?

13:02.166 --> 13:03.417
Mary Lou: I'm listening.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.834
Okay, I have an idea,
but we really do have to go,

13:05.917 --> 13:08.291
so can I explain it to you in the car?
Will you trust me?

13:10.667 --> 13:14.083
- Okay, I trust you, Teddy.
- Okay.

13:14.166 --> 13:17.041
Teddy gets the trust. Teddy gets the car.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.959
- Ivy, get my purse.
- Ivy gets the purse.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.667
Whoa, yeah! Good roll, honey.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.375
Take that, Duncan.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.083
- You're up, honey.
- Okay.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.125
Does she have to do this every time?

13:50.208 --> 13:53.041
Don't talk or she will start over.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.125
Come on, precious.

13:58.417 --> 14:00.333
Mama needs you now, baby girl.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.792
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

14:08.875 --> 14:11.583
- Whoo!
- All right!

14:11.667 --> 14:12.667
Let's keep it going.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.583
Gabe, get ready. Your turn's coming up.

14:15.041 --> 14:16.166
Where is Gabe?

14:19.375 --> 14:21.834
Gabe, come on. It's your turn.

14:21.917 --> 14:23.667
- My turn to what?
- To bowl.

14:24.417 --> 14:25.500
Is that still going on?

14:26.041 --> 14:30.583
Gabe, look, this is just a silly game.
Your family is counting on you.

14:31.125 --> 14:34.875
Thanks, Dad, since you were talking,
I grabbed a bunny.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.709
I got 12 of these. Gimme another token.

14:38.792 --> 14:41.500
No, you're cut off. Let's go.

14:43.208 --> 14:44.959
I just gotta get this mystery box.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.250
No, come on, Dad!

14:54.667 --> 14:56.083
Yes!

14:56.166 --> 14:58.917
- You got a strike.
- Yeah, yeah, whatever. Come here.

15:00.250 --> 15:03.041
Hey, how you doing? Good. Got any tokens?

15:03.875 --> 15:06.333
- No.
- Come on, dude, help a brother out.

15:06.625 --> 15:09.250
- I don't have any tokens.
- You got money, right?

15:10.041 --> 15:12.000
I wanna sell you some
valuable information.

15:12.083 --> 15:14.208
What kind of valuable information?

15:14.291 --> 15:15.375
Let me see the money.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.500
Mom's looking at your buddy page
to spy on you.

15:22.583 --> 15:26.375
What? That's just--

15:27.875 --> 15:29.542
Mom's looking at my buddy page, huh?

15:31.250 --> 15:32.542
Bet I could have some fun with this.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.041
First, I better delete some stuff.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.208
It's almost time to go. Are you okay?

15:43.709 --> 15:46.875
I'm okay, but are you sure
this is going to work?

15:46.959 --> 15:49.375
Totally. You're gonna be awesome.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.375
Speaking of awesome.

15:52.500 --> 15:56.041
Yeah, I think we're gonna go
without the hat.

16:03.792 --> 16:07.000
- Yes! Oooh!
- Yes, yes! Yes!

16:07.083 --> 16:09.125
All Gabe has gotta do
is just knock down two pins.

16:09.208 --> 16:11.583
We win. You can do that
in your sleep, right, Gabe?

16:17.417 --> 16:18.500
What happened?

16:18.875 --> 16:21.709
I ran out of tokens
and now my arm's stuck.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.125
Okay, I'll scoot over

16:25.208 --> 16:28.041
and you reach up in there
and get that box.

16:29.834 --> 16:32.291
Little problem, Duncan?

16:32.375 --> 16:34.500
Hey, man, you got any tokens?

16:35.959 --> 16:38.166
If your kid can't bowl,
the Duncan's forfeit.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.250
Hey, we are not gonna forfeit.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.166
Well, we only have the Lane
for another 10 minutes.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.750
Where are you going
to find another Duncan?

16:49.834 --> 16:51.041
It's a long shot,

16:52.959 --> 16:55.125
but there's one Duncan left.

16:56.625 --> 16:59.500
Okay, Charlie,
the whole family's counting on you.

17:00.125 --> 17:03.083
All you have to do
is just knock down two pins,

17:03.166 --> 17:05.792
and we're not gonna be losers anymore.

17:07.083 --> 17:09.083
- Okay, go ahead.
- Go ahead.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.417
Go ahead.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.959
Whoa, whoa!

17:15.750 --> 17:17.917
Okay, it's okay. Shake it off.

17:18.709 --> 17:20.041
All right.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.959
We're down to our last ball.

17:25.166 --> 17:26.458
It's a very special ball.

17:31.375 --> 17:32.750
Pa announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,

17:32.834 --> 17:36.041
please rise for the singing
of our national anthem,

17:36.125 --> 17:40.250
which will be performed tonight
by Denver housewife Mary Lou Wentz!

Okay, Charlie, mommy looked
on PJ'S buddy page

19:25.458 --> 19:27.625
and found out they're throwing
a surprise party for me.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.959
- Why, mama?
- Well, as PJ put it,

19:31.041 --> 19:33.750
it's a spontaneous celebration
of the world's best mom.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.709
Now when we walk in,
don't forget to act surprised.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.542
Hi, everybody, I'm home.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.208
They must be in the kitchen.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.667
Hi, everybody, I'm home.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.709
- The basement.
- Yeah.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.709
Definitely the basement.

19:54.792 --> 19:58.333
Hi, everybody, I'm home.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.041
- Hey, mom.
- Where's the--

20:01.792 --> 20:03.208
Where's the what?

20:03.709 --> 20:06.041
I mean, what are you talking about?

20:07.458 --> 20:09.542
I'm talking about you
snooping on my buddy page.

20:11.333 --> 20:12.583
Anything you wanna say to me?

20:14.041 --> 20:15.250
I hate the Internet.

20:21.375 --> 20:24.458
Well, Charlie, Mary Lou
sang the national anthem,

20:24.542 --> 20:25.959
and I won the car.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.250
Well, you won the car.

20:31.208 --> 20:33.792
Teddy: Seems the contest was sponsored
by a toy company.

20:35.625 --> 20:38.166
I really gotta read the fine print.

20:39.417 --> 20:44.458
So not only did you win the car,
you also won the bowling tournament.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.333
I don't know why I'm leaving
these video diaries for you.

20:47.417 --> 20:48.917
You should be leaving them for me.

20:49.375 --> 20:51.625
Good luck, Teddy, huh?

20:52.375 --> 20:54.875
I'm kidding. Good luck, Charlie.

20:58.667 --> 21:02.458
Oh, I can't wait to open this mystery box.
There could be anything in here.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.458
A whistle?

21:10.667 --> 21:13.083
I spent 500 tokens on a whistle?

21:22.250 --> 21:23.834
Hello, master.

21:25.750 --> 21:28.667
Whoa! A genie.

21:29.083 --> 21:31.792
Hey, you look kind of familiar.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.542
People say I look like Brad Pitt.

21:37.417 --> 21:40.500
I'm here to Grant you three wishes.
You have one minute. Go!

21:42.583 --> 21:44.875
Okay, I wish I knew what to ask for.

21:44.959 --> 21:46.667
- That's one.
- That counted?

21:47.250 --> 21:49.125
- Man, I wish I hadn't done that.
- That's two.

21:49.208 --> 21:52.208
Okay. Ugh! Okay,
really gotta be careful on this one.

21:53.625 --> 21:55.041
Hey, wait, what's going on?

21:55.125 --> 21:56.959
- Shh! Not now, not now.
- But, PJ--

21:57.041 --> 21:58.166
I wish you'd leave me alone.

21:59.917 --> 22:02.291
And that's three.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.417
Men

22:06.750 --> 22:07.709
Still got a whistle though.
