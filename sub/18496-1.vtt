00:17.601 --> 00:19.520
El Gato!

00:36.693 --> 00:39.232
<b>4x01 - Familiar Feeling</b>

00:40.040 --> 00:42.000
I've done it!

00:42.084 --> 00:46.630
At last, I've discovered
the secret of the Crown of Souls!

00:46.713 --> 00:47.881
What? What is it?

00:47.965 --> 00:50.300
It does...

00:52.302 --> 00:54.263
- not work.
- Whoa!

00:54.513 --> 00:56.473
This cannot be. It must work.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.393
The Crown of Souls is the only way
to defeat the Bloodwolf.

00:59.476 --> 01:00.769
What are we gonna do?

01:00.852 --> 01:04.480
Maybe I could make him
a macramÃ© girlfriend.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.900
This is the most terrifying being
in existence.

01:06.984 --> 01:10.445
I do not think making a lady wolf
out of strings and beads is what we need.

01:10.529 --> 01:13.282
Okay, well, don't say
I didn't try to help.

01:13.365 --> 01:16.076
But that crown is broken, Puss. See?

01:16.159 --> 01:19.246
It should have a gem right here.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.747
What?

01:23.041 --> 01:26.503
A gem?
The Gem of the Crown!

01:26.920 --> 01:29.214
Oh, there's a story in the book.

01:29.840 --> 01:34.553
Oh, wait, here it is.
The Tale of the Gem of the Crown.

01:35.846 --> 01:39.349
"Good King Borvald, long ago,
possessed a mighty crown.

01:39.433 --> 01:43.520
He feared its strength in evil hands
could tear the whole world down.

01:43.603 --> 01:47.357
And so, he broke the gem
that fueled the crown into three parts,

01:47.441 --> 01:51.320
and gave them to three witches,
masters of the darkest arts.

01:51.653 --> 01:55.449
The Eldritch Sisters, they were called,
and they fought with each other.

01:55.532 --> 01:59.119
So good King Borvald knew
the gem could not be brought together.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.997
Thus the pieces of the gem
could never reunite.

02:02.080 --> 02:06.418
And so, the world was safe
from this dread crown's enchanted might."

02:07.336 --> 02:09.545
That's a lot of rhyming.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.131
I know what I must do.

02:11.214 --> 02:15.594
I will find the pieces of this gem and
restore the power of the Crown of Souls.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.554
- Ooh, can I come?
- No.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.432
- I know where those witches are.
- Then yes.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.433
And I'll come too.

02:21.516 --> 02:25.771
No, I cannot let you risk your life.
This is far too dangerous.

02:25.854 --> 02:29.691
If it's so dangerous,
you need me there to protect you.

02:30.275 --> 02:33.654
Dulcinea, I know
you are strong and capable.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.572
But you are so important to me.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.699
I would feel better
if you were safe at home.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.494
And, anyways,
this is not a journey for a lady.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.121
Duchess, you will come with us.

02:43.205 --> 02:46.708
What's happening? Where are we going?
Are we getting ice cream?

02:46.792 --> 02:50.420
We, including me,
are going on a dangerous journey.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.881
And ice cream after?

02:52.964 --> 02:54.383
- I guess.
- I'm in!

02:54.466 --> 02:56.968
Dulcinea! I will not allow you to go!

02:57.052 --> 02:57.928
But, Puss...

02:58.011 --> 03:00.680
Nothing will change my mind. Nothing!

03:09.773 --> 03:12.818
I still remember our first date, Duchy.

03:12.901 --> 03:16.113
You were as beautiful then as you are now.

03:16.696 --> 03:20.867
Why all the flattery? Are you going to
ask to borrow money or something?

03:20.951 --> 03:24.579
Oh, I've just been thinking a lot
about our time together.

03:24.663 --> 03:29.334
That picnic, when I turned the ants
into elephants and got trampled.

03:29.418 --> 03:33.046
That carriage ride through the forest,
when I got mauled by a bear.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.757
Oh, they're so cute together, aren't they?

03:35.841 --> 03:37.884
I would chose death
over listening to this.

03:38.468 --> 03:42.347
You dragged me to the finish line,
and I woke up just in time for Halloween.

03:42.931 --> 03:46.560
Oh, we did have
some good times together, didn't we?

03:46.643 --> 03:49.730
We sure did, sugar biscuit.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.025
Please let there be an end to this!

03:54.109 --> 03:57.154
Look, a dark, terrifying castle.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.155
Yes!

04:00.657 --> 04:03.452
I don't like the looks of that castle.

04:03.535 --> 04:06.413
Really? No offense,
but it seems like your kind of place.

04:06.496 --> 04:10.041
I have a bad feeling about it.
It hurts my head.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.753
It seems familiar somehow.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.212
Let us go inside.

04:14.296 --> 04:16.757
No! I'll just wait here.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.800
Keep a lookout.

04:18.884 --> 04:22.679
Duchess, if we do not get that gem,
we will never defeat the Bloodwolf.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.682
Facing a witch, we may need
your knowledge of magic.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.517
I think we should stick together.

04:27.601 --> 04:31.897
It's okay, honey lumps.
I won't let the big, bad castle get you.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.238
Now, come, let us enter
this foreboding castle

04:40.322 --> 04:43.867
and face whatever unspeakable evil
lies within, together.

05:01.593 --> 05:02.427
Shh.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.807
Hmm. It is empty.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.433
Where did she go?

05:52.227 --> 05:53.728
Someone must live here.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.358
Ooh.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.489
It feels...

06:05.073 --> 06:05.949
Hmm.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.729
I am Malviola.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.689
I am a witch.

06:39.691 --> 06:40.859
Could you tell?

06:41.443 --> 06:42.277
Tell what?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.738
That I'm a witch.
I mean, was it immediately obvious?

06:44.821 --> 06:47.616
I have a pointy hat. I have a broom.
And a wand.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.951
Yes, it was quite apparent.

06:50.035 --> 06:53.455
I am so a witch, it isn't even funny.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.748
Yes, we get that.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.041
Listen to me cackle.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.294
And my skin is green.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.379
Umm,
I'm pretty sure that's makeup.

07:01.463 --> 07:05.592
No. My skin is green.
It isn't pink. I hate pink.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.345
Also, I hate puppies and butterflies
and frilly dresses.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.722
Because I'm a witch,
and witches don't like that stuff.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.224
Yes, yes, you are very much a witch.

07:13.308 --> 07:17.520
I am. Just like the witches in this book
that shows you how to be a witch.

07:22.025 --> 07:26.488
I think that it is very clear to all of us
that you are a witch. Right, everyone?

07:26.571 --> 07:28.698
- Clear as day.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.701
Umm, we are looking for
the Gem of the Crown of Souls.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.119
- Do you...
- Sure, I have part of it.

07:33.203 --> 07:36.039
But my sisters have the other pieces,
and you won't have any luck with them.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.917
They are the worst!
They'll make fun of you

07:39.000 --> 07:41.086
and never let you change
the channel on the crystal ball

07:41.169 --> 07:42.462
and steal your boyfriend.

07:42.545 --> 07:47.676
What? Let's go, Arty. I can't spend
another minute in this place.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.720
I'd go anywhere with you, bubblecakes.

07:51.846 --> 07:56.309
So, Malviola, is it? I'm Dulcinea,
and this is Puss in Boots.

07:56.393 --> 07:57.978
And umm, we're wondering if...

07:58.061 --> 08:02.399
Wait a second. You're cats! I need a cat.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.568
See? I have everything a witch has,
because I am a witch.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.779
Everything but a cat.

08:07.862 --> 08:11.366
A witch is supposed to have a cat
for a familiar. It's a witch thing.

08:11.449 --> 08:15.328
If one of you agrees to be my familiar,
I will let you have my piece of the gem.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.041
And what exactly does
being your familiar entail?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.377
Oh, the usual stuff.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.838
I would see through your eyes,
control your mind,

08:24.921 --> 08:26.715
make you my servant for all eternity.

08:27.090 --> 08:30.010
We'd be best friends forever.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.222
Yes, well, that is very nice of you,

08:34.304 --> 08:37.892
but we do not want to do that because
you are really, very really creepy.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.688
And what makes you think
you have any choice?

08:43.231 --> 08:44.899
Why must everything be difficult?

08:53.199 --> 08:55.326
It sounds like it's going well in there.

08:55.410 --> 08:59.914
Yes, let's just, uh, step outside
while they sort things out.

09:20.060 --> 09:20.894
Whoa.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.904
Stop! I'll be your familiar.

09:32.447 --> 09:35.825
Dulcinea, no! I cannot allow you
to make that sacrifice.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.494
I will be your familiar.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.540
Puss, I said I would protect you,
and I meant it. Take me!

09:42.624 --> 09:43.708
No, me!

09:43.792 --> 09:48.171
Oh, I see you're fighting over
the great honor, because I am a witch.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.341
You must take me.
Dulcinea would be a terrible familiar.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.467
She is too kind-hearted.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.720
You don't want Puss. He snores.
And he chews with his mouth open.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.055
She sheds in hot weather.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.973
- He picks his toes.
- She cannot swim.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.183
He has fleas!

10:01.476 --> 10:02.685
Dulcinea!

10:03.436 --> 10:05.188
I know I crossed a line there. I'm sorry.

10:05.271 --> 10:10.193
Two cats fighting over me.
I am the witchiest witch ever.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.780
Cats, I will give you one hour
to prepare your arguments,

10:13.863 --> 10:16.074
and then I will return
and render my decision.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.035
I'm a witch.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.455
You have to let me do this, Puss.

10:22.539 --> 10:26.042
No, I will not. I cannot let you
give up your life to this witch.

10:26.126 --> 10:30.880
Puss, we all have sacrifices to make.
I'm a part of the team too.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.175
Then I will make the sacrifice.
The orphans need you.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.302
San Lorenzo needs you.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.388
No! And that is final.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.934
I will turn myself into the finest
familiar a witch could want. I go!

10:45.895 --> 10:48.064
If I'm gonna be
a better familiar than Puss,

10:48.148 --> 10:49.649
I'm gonna need some help.

10:51.192 --> 10:55.155
Of course I can help you, dear.
I know what witches like.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.448
But are you sure you want to do this?

10:57.532 --> 11:01.870
I can't let Puss give up his life
to Malviola. Say, where's Artephius?

11:02.453 --> 11:04.789
I'm sure I don't know. We aren't speaking.

11:04.873 --> 11:08.793
What? But you were getting along so well.
What did you do?

11:08.877 --> 11:13.131
The brash fool declared that
he could throw farther than I can.

11:13.214 --> 11:17.886
I threw him. Really far.
I am very good at throwing.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.138
So, what can we do

11:20.221 --> 11:22.765
to make you a more desirable familiar?

11:22.849 --> 11:26.728
You should be black.
Witches love black cats.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.146
How are you gonna do that?

11:28.229 --> 11:30.773
Burn you black with fire!

11:34.485 --> 11:37.614
Uh-huh. Okay. Let's, maybe,
see if we can think of something else.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.490
Think, Puss, think.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.701
What can I do to get Malviola to pick me,

11:41.784 --> 11:43.786
to spare Dulcinea from that terrible fate?

11:43.870 --> 11:47.874
How can I make myself
even more irresistible to a lady?

11:47.957 --> 11:51.461
Well, don't say you can throw
farther than her, that's for sure.

11:51.544 --> 11:55.506
Artephius. Who did this to you?
Let me know so that I may avenge you.

11:55.590 --> 11:56.925
It was the Duchess.

11:58.134 --> 12:02.472
Well, I am sure that she had her reasons.
Artephius, I need your help.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.266
To become the ideal witch's familiar?

12:05.350 --> 12:07.435
Yes, how did you know?

12:07.518 --> 12:08.895
Wait, what, was that right?

12:08.978 --> 12:12.231
Oh. I thought I was just saying
one of my usual crazy things.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.861
Hmm? Oh.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.781
Umm...

12:19.864 --> 12:22.867
I don't see how this makes me
a better familiar.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.453
Well, I don't know.
It's just some spell I have.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.372
Oh, how about a rattlesnake?

12:27.622 --> 12:30.458
Umm, no snakes please.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.502
Hmm, what else?
What else?

12:32.835 --> 12:33.753
Ooh!

12:33.836 --> 12:35.004
Sandbags!

12:36.631 --> 12:38.007
Uh. Umm...

12:38.091 --> 12:42.428
Oh, mood lighting. Always works
like a charm on dinner dates.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.477
I'm sure
Puss is doing better than this.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.145
Uh...

12:52.522 --> 12:53.731
Why am I upside down?

12:53.815 --> 12:55.274
Don't you know?

12:55.358 --> 12:59.654
There's nothing better than mimicking
a bat's behavior to become a vampire.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.074
Artephius! You're supposed to help me
become a witch's familiar.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.243
Oh!

13:05.326 --> 13:09.706
Why don't you practice some
witchy cat poses, like in Malviola's book?

13:09.789 --> 13:10.957
Excellent.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.209
Like this?

13:13.876 --> 13:14.711
Hmm.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.504
Maybe more of a spooky face?

13:17.255 --> 13:18.548
Woo!

13:18.631 --> 13:20.633
Meh. You can do better.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.678
- Egh.
- Nope.

13:24.178 --> 13:29.434
Next. Next. Next.
Next!

13:29.517 --> 13:31.019
- Aggh!
- Nope.

13:31.102 --> 13:35.106
- Ughh! Eeh! Ooh!
- No. No. No!

13:35.648 --> 13:37.108
Wait, wait, wait. Ooh.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.986
Hmm.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.779
Next!

13:43.406 --> 13:46.576
No. No! No.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.746
I said witchy cat. Those aren't witchy.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.956
Think witchy. Now try again.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.625
Mmm...

13:54.709 --> 13:56.711
Nope. No.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.504
- Ugghh!
- Nope!

13:58.588 --> 14:01.674
- Eggh!
- No. No. No!

14:01.799 --> 14:04.093
Nope. No.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.094
No!

14:05.178 --> 14:06.679
Never!

14:06.763 --> 14:08.014
- No.
- Nope.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.807
- No.
- Nope.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.225
- No.
- Stop!

14:13.478 --> 14:14.312
Bigger.

14:15.104 --> 14:19.734
More. More. More.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.403
Wait, no, too much, too much.
Agh!

14:22.487 --> 14:23.613
Ah, there it is!

14:23.696 --> 14:28.701
Perfect! Oh, you'll win first prize
in the pie-eating contest for sure.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.328
What?

14:32.663 --> 14:33.915
No, no, no.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.793
Malviola is definitely
going to choose Puss.

14:36.876 --> 14:42.090
He's so theatrical. And he's orange,
which is practically red, like blood.

14:42.173 --> 14:45.426
Plus he's got those black leather boots,

14:45.510 --> 14:50.264
and that adorable accent,
and he's so handsome and charming.

14:51.682 --> 14:52.975
Eh, where were we?

14:53.559 --> 14:55.144
You were making me uncomfortable?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.145
Oh, yes.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.606
No, there's just not much I can do,

14:58.689 --> 15:01.275
short of actually turning you into Puss.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.946
That's it! You can make me look like Puss,
and when she picks him,

15:05.029 --> 15:06.280
she'll be picking me!

15:06.864 --> 15:08.366
Do you have a spell that can do that?

15:08.449 --> 15:10.535
I have just the thing.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.954
The soul of Klaus Von Braunschweig,

15:13.037 --> 15:15.873
master of the transformation spell.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.292
Hello!
Are we having eine party?

15:18.376 --> 15:19.210
Shut up!

15:31.889 --> 15:34.934
- Oh, good, you didn't explode.
- What?

15:35.017 --> 15:35.935
Whoo!

15:36.269 --> 15:39.647
Oh, my gosh. I'm Puss.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.023
I'm Puss!

15:41.107 --> 15:42.817
Whee!

15:42.900 --> 15:49.115
Yes, exactly. Except for your voice,
mannerisms, posture, personality and walk!

15:49.198 --> 15:50.783
What's wrong with my walk?

15:50.867 --> 15:54.328
Uh, try more of a,
you know, a man walk.

15:55.204 --> 16:00.376
Stomp around and take up more space
like you own everything.

16:01.419 --> 16:04.547
Puff your chest out more.
Pick up your feet.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.551
That's better. Now, try the accent.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.678
Hello. I'm...

16:10.761 --> 16:13.723
Puss never uses contractions!

16:14.807 --> 16:17.393
I am...
I am...

16:18.561 --> 16:21.772
I am Puss in Boots!

16:22.440 --> 16:26.944
That's pretty good. Say, crazy idea,
are you busy for dinner?

16:31.240 --> 16:33.576
I, the great Puss in Boots,

16:33.659 --> 16:36.120
hereby demand to be your familiar!

16:37.330 --> 16:39.165
Look at how perfect I am.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.559
Oh, yes! You're perfect!

17:01.562 --> 17:03.022
Imposter!

17:03.105 --> 17:04.357
Umm...

17:04.440 --> 17:09.487
I am not the imposter. I am Puss in Boots.
You are the imposter.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.906
Dulcinea? Is that you?

17:12.990 --> 17:15.826
No. Get the gem from Malviola and go,

17:15.910 --> 17:20.373
you, who are not Puss in Boots,
because I am Puss in Boots!

17:20.455 --> 17:23.834
No, no, no ,no. You are not Puss in Boots.
I am Puss in Boots.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.170
I am Puss in Boots.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.922
I am a great adventurer.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.550
I am a great adventurer.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.843
I am the finest swordsman in the world.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.012
I am the finest swordsman in the world.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.766
I am a big, stupid baby.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.477
You are a big, stupid baby.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.521
- Knock it off!
- Knock it off!

17:43.604 --> 17:44.897
This is really very annoying.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.108
- Which one is really Puss?
- This is really very annoying.

17:47.191 --> 17:50.361
I'm not sure but I think I'm having dinner
with whoever loses.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.238
I am the greatest hero

17:52.321 --> 17:54.156
ever in the history of everything,

17:54.240 --> 17:56.242
and also including the future!

17:56.325 --> 18:00.162
Why are you being so arrogant?
I do not act like that.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.831
Do I act like that?

18:01.914 --> 18:03.416
- That's you exactly.
- Yeah, you sure do.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.128
You cannot be as good as a swordsman as I.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.718
Wow. That is actually really good.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.683
So, you want to dance with Puss in Boots?

18:20.766 --> 18:23.060
No one is better at being me than me.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.521
Capo Ferro!

18:26.188 --> 18:27.815
Hey, I taught you that!

18:31.569 --> 18:34.822
Stop it! What is going on here?
Are you trying to trick me?

18:38.326 --> 18:40.328
I have had enough!

18:41.370 --> 18:43.581
I'm going to out-witch
all the other witches

18:43.664 --> 18:45.249
and have two familiars!

18:45.333 --> 18:49.670
No, four. I'm taking you all!
I am a witch!

18:53.299 --> 18:55.217
Whoa.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.573
Oh!

19:20.284 --> 19:24.997
Wintergreen! My favorite.
Oh, Arty, you remembered.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.424
If we're gonna do this,
we have to work together.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.926
I can distract her.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.387
Hey, witch. Over here!

19:39.470 --> 19:41.597
We're going to need
that transformation spell.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.307
And get ready to throw.

19:43.391 --> 19:44.684
What?

19:51.899 --> 19:52.817
Whoa!

19:56.028 --> 19:57.405
Now!

20:09.917 --> 20:11.502
Look. A pretty pink butterfly.

20:11.585 --> 20:15.047
Oh, where? Wait, that's not pink.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.550
It is not a butterfly either.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.147
You beat me.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.357
How could you beat me?

20:33.941 --> 20:34.775
I am...

20:37.570 --> 20:38.904
I am not a witch.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.450
- It's okay, Malviola.
- No, it's not!

20:42.533 --> 20:45.661
Now you all know
I like pink and butterflies.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.538
Witches don't like that stuff.

20:48.122 --> 20:51.125
Witches can like whatever they want.
Look at me.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.919
I was disguised as Puss,
but I was still me.

20:54.003 --> 20:57.089
And you'll still be you
no matter what things you like.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.675
You'll still be a witch.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.428
I will?

21:02.511 --> 21:03.888
You will.

21:11.228 --> 21:17.401
So, I can like pink and butterflies
and puppies and pretty, frilly dresses?

21:17.485 --> 21:19.487
Oh, yes. Yes, you can.

21:19.570 --> 21:23.532
You've made me
the happiest witch in the world. Here.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.284
Take my piece of the gem.

21:25.367 --> 21:28.621
I can't wait to get this makeup off.
It's so sweaty.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.248
Wait, when did Dulcinea get here?

21:31.499 --> 21:35.127
- She's been here all along.
- Duchy! When did you get here?

21:35.211 --> 21:37.797
Oh, Arty, never change.

21:40.549 --> 21:44.512
Puss, I'm sorry if you were insulted
when I was acting like you.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.555
I was just trying to protect you.

21:46.639 --> 21:51.393
I knew it! So I do not really
act that way. Arrogant and egotistical.

21:51.477 --> 21:52.895
Oh, no, you totally do.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.649
And I wouldn't have you any other way.

21:56.732 --> 22:00.694
I'm pink! I'm pink, and I'm going to
get a puppy for a familiar.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.175
Yes, very good.

22:02.176 --> 22:06.367
Now, I wonder if you could
direct us to the next witch.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.203
Oh, my sister Malaranea
is right down the hall.

22:09.870 --> 22:13.582
But you don't want to get near her.
She is the worst.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.418
I mean, imagine the worst thing
you can think of.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.212
Being licked by a dog?

22:18.796 --> 22:19.839
She's worse than that.

22:23.259 --> 22:26.387
Come, my friends.
We must go to this Malaranea,

22:26.470 --> 22:28.639
even if she spells our doom.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.475
Goodbye! Goodbye! Thank you!

22:31.559 --> 22:34.853
I'm pink.
I'm pink, and I'm a witch.

22:34.937 --> 22:35.896
I am a witch!
