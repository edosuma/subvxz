WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.142
( theme music playing )

00:19.587 --> 00:21.655
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GETTING THIS NUMBER.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.291
IT DIDN'T EVEN
TAKE ME THAT LONG.

00:23.391 --> 00:26.260
- WE'RE EASY IN NEW YORK.
- JEEZ, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.729
- WE'LL GO OUT TO DINNER.
- COOL, I LIKE TO EAT.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.898
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT CHOKING

00:30.998 --> 00:32.833
BECAUSE I'M GREAT
AT THE HEIMLICH.

00:32.933 --> 00:36.036
OH, WELL, GOD, YOU KNOW,
IF I WASN'T GONNA GIVE YOU
MY NUMBER BEFORE,

00:36.137 --> 00:37.771
THAT JUST DID IT.
THAT'S AN IMPRESSIVE SKILL.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.740
- DID THAT CLINCH IT?
- YEAH.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.543
ARE YOU LEAVING RIGHT NOW?
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
RUN INTO EACH OTHER AGAIN.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.778
- YEAH, THAT
WOULD BE SO AWKWARD.
- THAT WOULD BE AWKWARD.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.948
I'M NOT LEAVING JUST YET.
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU
CAN GET OUT OF HERE.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.717
WE HAVE TO SAVE
SOMETHING FOR DINNER.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.552
- THERE YOU GO.
- BECAUSE IF WE HAVE
TOO GOOD A TIME HERE--

00:51.652 --> 00:55.123
- SO JUST GET OUT.
- I KIND OF LIKE THAT,
ACTUALLY.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.625
- ( laughs ) BYE.
- I'M GONNA CALL YOU.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.662
HEY HEY, LOOK WHO IT IS.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.464
- HEY! ROSIE!
- LARRY DAVID.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.633
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.535
- YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
SO DO YOU.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.337
- YOU LIKE THE ART?
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH...

01:09.437 --> 01:11.472
- WHAT?
- ...FORGET ABOUT THE ART.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.940
WHAT?

01:13.040 --> 01:15.976
I MET THE MOST
FANTASTIC WOMAN TONIGHT.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.045
I-- I'M--
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.813
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- SWEAR TO GOD.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.549
- SO DID I.
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.617
I FELT IT RIGHT AWAY.
YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN FEEL IT?

01:23.717 --> 01:25.886
YES. I MEAN, WHO KNOWS
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?
BUT IT'S A GREAT START.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.855
OH NO, I THINK
SOMETHING'S GONNA HAPPEN.
YOU KNOW HOW LESBIANS ARE.

01:27.955 --> 01:30.458
YOU KNOW WHAT A LESBIAN
BRINGS ON A SECOND DATE?
A U-HAUL.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.660
- ( laughs )
- THAT'S RIGHT, A U-HAUL.
THEY MOVE IN TOGETHER.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.563
- THEY MOVE RIGHT IN.
- I LOOKED AT HER AND I THOUGHT
HYPHEN NAME.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.865
KIDS ARE GONNA
GET TO KNOW HER.
IT'S ALL GONNA WORK.

01:37.965 --> 01:40.368
- THAT'S LOVELY.
- I'M HAPPY FOR YOU
I REALLY AM.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.570
I'M COMPLETELY SMITTEN.
SHE SMILED.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.839
- AT YOU?
- AT ME. SMILING AT
AN OLD BALD MAN.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.709
- MINE IS SO VIVACIOUS.
- MINE'S VIVACIOUS TOO.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.077
AND BUILT.

01:50.178 --> 01:53.747
A BODY I WOULD LIKE
TO GET MY HANDS ON.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.583
- OOH!
- EXACTLY.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.386
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

01:58.486 --> 02:00.154
- SHE'S JEWISH.
- NO KIDDING.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.755
- YEAH.
- CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

02:01.855 --> 02:02.790
- WHAT?
- MINE TOO.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.024
- REALLY?
- YES.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.793
- UNBELIEVABLE.
- CHEERS.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.761
- L'CHAIM.
- L'CHAIM.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.630
- IT'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
- YOURS IS JEWISH?

02:09.730 --> 02:12.032
YEAH, I KNEW FROM HER NAME.
O'DONNELL, IRISH, DUH.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.902
YEAH, RIGHT.
YEAH, COHN, JEWISH.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.437
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.573
- WHAT DID YOU SAY? COHN?
- MMM.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.242
JANE COHN?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.918
HOLY SHIT.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.454
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
IS THIS A JOKE?

02:33.554 --> 02:36.023
- HOW'S IT A JOKE?
HERE'S THE NUMBER.
- HOW'D YOU GET THAT?

02:36.123 --> 02:37.558
- SHE GAVE IT TO ME.
- SHE GAVE IT TO YOU?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.727
WHAT AM I, A MAGICIAN?
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
A CARD ON YOU?

02:39.827 --> 02:42.029
WHY WOULD SHE
GIVE US BOTH HER CARD?
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.131
OBVIOUSLY SHE'S BI-SEXUAL.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.899
- FUCKING HATE THAT.
- WHAT IS THAT?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.202
WHAT IS THAT ANYWAY?
I MEAN, PICK A SIDE
ALREADY, RIGHT?

02:48.302 --> 02:49.770
- ABSOLUTELY.
- CAN'T YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND?

02:49.870 --> 02:52.005
WHAT IS THIS?
THEY HAVE TO HAVE SEX
WITH EVERYONE?

02:52.105 --> 02:55.042
- THEY HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING?
- HALF THE POPULATION ISN'T
ENOUGH FOR THEM?

02:55.142 --> 02:57.077
- THEY WANT EVERYBODY?
THEY'RE SO SELFISH?
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.214
SHE DID NOT SEEM
THE TYPE TO ME.

03:00.314 --> 03:03.617
- SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:03.717 --> 03:06.754
I GUESS YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO BACK AWAY BECAUSE
MOST OF THESE WOMEN

03:06.854 --> 03:08.689
WHO SAY THEY'RE BI
ARE REALLY GAY AND THEY
JUST CAN'T SAY IT.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.891
- BACK AWAY? ME BACK AWAY?
- YEAH, I THINK YOU SHOULD.

03:10.991 --> 03:13.294
WHY WOULD I BACK AWAY?
THIS WOMAN IS CRAZY ABOUT ME.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.962
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
- YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

03:15.062 --> 03:17.030
- REALLY?
- BECAUSE I FELT IT.
MY BODY FELT IT, OKAY?

03:17.130 --> 03:19.933
I CAME ALIVE IN AREAS
THAT HAVE BEEN DRY LIKE
THE SAHARA DESERT.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.271
- YOU FOLLOW ME, LARRY?
- LOOK, IN BASEBALL THE TIE
GOES TO THE RUNNER.

03:23.371 --> 03:26.440
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS,
TIE GOES TO THE HETERO.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.042
IT WAS NO TIE, BABE.
SHE HIT MY BASE FIRST

03:29.142 --> 03:30.578
CLEANLY BEFORE
SHE EVEN SAW YOU.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.446
YOU'RE INTENT ON GOING
THROUGH THIS?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.615
OF COURSE I AM.
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET HURT, LARRY.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.418
YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT, RIGHT?
A LOT OF OTHER WOMEN HERE.

03:37.518 --> 03:40.354
PROBABLY WOMEN
WHO ARE MORE YOUR SPEED.
MORE YOUR LEVEL.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.556
SPARE YOURSELF THE EXPENSE
AND EMBARRASSMENT.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.758
- GET OUT OF THIS NOW.
- OKAY, SAVE MYSELF?

03:44.858 --> 03:46.660
YES, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
GONNA BE ANNIHILATED.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.663
I'M GONNA BE
ANNIHILATED BY YOU
IN THE LOVE DEPARTMENT?

03:49.763 --> 03:51.765
- WE'LL JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
- GAME ON, LARRY DAVID.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.034
- YOU'VE GOT IT, SISTER.
- ALL RIGHT.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.103
- GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
- YOU'RE IN OVER YOUR HEAD,
ROSIE.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.571
- YOU THINK SO?
- I KNOW SO.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.873
SHE'S A DYKE.
DEAL WITH IT.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.379
HO HO! LOOK WHO'S IN
THE MOTHERFUCKING HOUSE!

04:05.479 --> 04:07.781
HA HA! LEON IN
THE MOTHERFUCKING HOUSE!

04:07.881 --> 04:10.784
YOU DROVE THE CAR?
LOOK WHAT YOU DID TO THE CAR.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.354
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
THIS MOTHERFUCKING CAR
HAS GOT SOME HEART, MAN.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.589
I WAS SURPRISED.
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A BITCH-ASS CAR.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.325
THIS SHIT GOT SOME
FUCKING HEART TO IT.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.259
- WHY DIDN'T YOU FLY?
- I DON'T FLY, BABY.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.762
YOU GOT TO HAVE A PHOTO I.D.
FOR THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING? FUCK THAT.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.264
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
CAN GIVE A CAR BACK TO
SOMEBODY IN THIS CONDITION.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.899
THIS MOTHERFUCKER
HAS SOME ROOM TO IT TOO.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.768
I GOT EIGHT MOTHERFUCKERS
UP IN THIS CAR.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.770
- YEAH. WHAT?
- I THOUGHT IT HELD
ONLY FOUR PEOPLE.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.305
WHAT DID YOU DO?
YOU PICKED UP HITCHHIKERS?

04:31.405 --> 04:32.673
SEE THE BABY SEAT BACK THERE?
HELL YEAH.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.274
COME ON, MAN.
LET ME SEE YOUR PLACE, MAN.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.676
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ANYWAY?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.511
I HAD TO GET OUT OF
THAT FUCKING HOUSE, MAN.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.147
- ROOMMATE WAS DRIVING
ME CRAZY AND SHIT.
- THE WHO?

04:40.247 --> 04:41.549
- THE ROOMMATE ALL IN MY SHIT.
- ROOMMATE?

04:41.649 --> 04:43.684
- LET ME SEE THE PLACE, MAN.
- WHAT ROOMMATE?

04:43.784 --> 04:46.954
- THE FUCKING ROOMMATE AT
THE HOUSE IN CALIFORNIA.
- Larry: WHAT?

04:48.556 --> 04:51.759
SO SHE GAVE-- SHE GAVE
HER PHONE NUMBER

04:51.859 --> 04:54.895
- TO ME AND ROSIE O'DONNELL.
- OOOH!

04:54.995 --> 04:57.798
WHOA, LOOK AT THIS, MAN!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME, LARRY?

04:57.898 --> 05:00.267
- RENNY HARLIN'S PLACE.
- OH SHIT.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.436
NEW YORK CITY, BABY.
I'M HERE!

05:02.536 --> 05:04.372
YOU GOT TO TELL PEOPLE
YOU'RE HERE SOMETIMES, RIGHT?

05:04.472 --> 05:05.673
ANYWAY, SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT IT?

05:05.773 --> 05:07.441
I'M IN COMPETITION
WITH ROSIE O'DONNELL.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.742
- WOW, MAN.
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.344
I'M FEELING A LITTLE
INSECURE ABOUT IT.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.279
LESBIANS HAVE KIND OF
AN ADVANTAGE IN A WAY.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.747
THEY SOME
TRICKY MOTHERFUCKERS.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.583
FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING DOWN THERE.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.250
LADIES KNOW THAT SHIT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.587
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
I CAN'T COMPETE WITH
A LESBIAN LIKE THAT.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.855
THEY KNOW EVERY NOOK
AND CRANNY. YOU KNOW,
EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.592
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF WE WERE BI-SEXUALS?
I COULDN'T BE COMFORTABLE NOW.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.860
I WOULDN'T BE
COMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW.
I'D BE ALL FUCKED UP.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.896
I WOULD HAVE ZERO INTEREST
IN A PERSON LIKE YOU.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.831
YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT.
ME TOO, LARRY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

05:30.931 --> 05:33.000
- OH, YOU WOULDN'T
BE INTERESTED IN ME?
- FUCK NO, LARRY.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.935
FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD
FUCKING THROW THE FUCK UP.

05:35.035 --> 05:38.539
I WOULD REGURGITATE MY OWN SHIT.
I WOULD REGURGITATE AND SHIT.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.141
YOU THINK I'D GO
OUT WITH A GUY WEARING
A GREEN WIFE-BEATER?

05:41.241 --> 05:42.810
- LOOK AT YOU.
- FIRST OF ALL, LOOK AT
THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.345
- THIS SHIT ON YOUR HEAD.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

05:45.446 --> 05:47.247
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
- OH, I GETS MINE, LARRY.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.850
I FUCKING GETS MINE.
YOU KNOW I GETS MINE.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.519
- ( laughing )
- OKAY.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.221
WHERE'S MY ROOM AT?
WHERE THE FUCK'S MY ROOM
AT, LARRY?

05:54.321 --> 05:56.490
HA HA!
I'M IN THE HOUSE!

06:00.461 --> 06:03.030
I'M HERE TO PICK UP
SOME FOOD TO GO. DAVID.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.765
- OKAY, ONE SECOND.
- OKAY.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.034
LARRY?

06:07.134 --> 06:08.669
- LARRY, HI.
- DUCKSTEIN.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.303
- WE'RE BOTH IN NEW YORK.
- YEAH, WE'RE BOTH IN NEW YORK.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.005
LOOK AT THIS, TWO ANGELINOS
HERE IN NEW YORK.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.207
- THAT'S SOMETHING, ISN'T IT?
- WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR?

06:14.307 --> 06:16.276
YOU KNOW, I JUST CAME.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.979
HEY, HERE'S A THOUGHT.
LET'S GO TO LUNCH.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.582
- TOMORROW?
- MMM.

06:21.682 --> 06:25.052
- MMM, I DON'T THINK SO.
- OKAY, THURSDAY.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.887
NO, I-I--
I DON'T THINK SO.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.357
- WHY NOT?
- WELL, WE REALLY DON'T
SEE EACH OTHER IN L.A.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.893
SO WHY-- IF WE'RE IN
ONE CITY ALL THE TIME

06:32.993 --> 06:35.195
AND WE NEVER HAVE LUNCH
IN THAT CITY,

06:35.295 --> 06:36.897
WHY WOULD WE HAVE LUNCH
IN THE NEW CITY?

06:36.997 --> 06:39.166
I SEE WHAT THIS IS.
I SEE WHAT THIS IS.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.769
YOU'RE STILL
HOLDING A GRUDGE

06:41.869 --> 06:45.105
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T INVITE YOU
TO JOANIE'S BAT MITZVAH.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.675
- YOU'LL NEVER
FORGIVE ME FOR THAT.
- NO NO.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.210
I'M TELLING YOU,
WE SENT IT OUT.
YOU WERE ON THE LIST.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.312
- I DID GET THE INVITATION.
- YEAH?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.915
YES, AND I PAID
SO LITTLE ATTENTION TO IT

06:55.015 --> 06:56.950
THAT I DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER
TO R.S.V.P.

06:57.050 --> 07:00.187
BECAUSE I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
INVITED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.456
I WAS OFFENDED
THAT I WAS INVITED.

07:02.556 --> 07:05.092
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT--
- THERE'S NOTHING TO
GET STRAIGHT.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.527
I'M GONNA EAT
ALONE TOMORROW.

07:06.627 --> 07:07.928
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO EAT WITH ME?

07:08.028 --> 07:10.430
BECAUSE WE NEVER GET
A CHANCE TO EAT IN L.A.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.666
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT FRIENDS.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.002
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS BECAUSE
WE NEVER SPEND TIME TOGETHER.

07:15.102 --> 07:19.006
WE DON'T SPEND TIME TOGETHER
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO
SPEND TIME TOGETHER.

07:19.106 --> 07:22.009
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU HAVE
A LITTLE ROOM FOR GROWTH?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.944
NO. DUCKSTEIN,

07:24.044 --> 07:26.146
I THINK WE'VE TAKEN US
ABOUT AS FAR AS WE CAN.

07:26.246 --> 07:30.150
THERE WILL BE NO LUNCH,
NO BREAKFAST OR DINNER.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.386
THERE WON'T BE A SNACK.
THERE WON'T BE COFFEE.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.955
THERE WON'T BE A DRINK.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.424
AND HOPEFULLY THERE WON'T
EVEN BE ANOTHER BUMP INTO.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.793
I FEEL BADLY FOR YOU

07:39.893 --> 07:42.863
BECAUSE LIFE IS LIKE THIS...

07:42.963 --> 07:46.233
- YES.
- ...AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS MADE IT LIKE THIS.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.135
I WANT TO MAKE THAT SMALLER.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.203
- REALLY?
- YES. SHRINK IT.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.039
SHRINK IT.
PUT THE HANDS TOGETHER.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.942
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
SEE YA, DUCKSTEIN.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.343
BYE, LARRY.

07:56.443 --> 07:59.613
- Jane: HELLO.
- Larry: I'M HERE.

07:59.713 --> 08:02.249
AWESOME.
THANK YOU FOR COMING OVER.

08:02.349 --> 08:05.786
I KNOW WE WANTED TO GO
OUT BUT MY CAT WILL NOT
STOP THROWING UP.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.889
- IT MAKES ME NERVOUS.
- MAYBE THE CAT KNEW
I WAS COMING.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.358
OH. MAYBE THAT'S WHY I WAS
THROWING UP A MINUTE AGO.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.260
- SEE, I HAVE THAT EFFECT.
- I GET IT, YES.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.564
- SHE'S GOT, LIKE,
EMPATHETIC NAUSEA...
- EXACTLY.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.666
- ...AT THE POTENTIAL
OF YOUR ARRIVAL.
- EXACTLY, YES. YES.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.468
YEAH, EVER SINCE I MET YOU
I CAN'T STOP PUKING.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.936
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.038
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON
WHO'S TOLD ME THAT.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.306
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.708
YOU JUST HAVE THAT
EFFECT ON PEOPLE?

08:27.808 --> 08:29.142
I DO.
PARTICULARLY WOMEN.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.511
- THAT'S HOT.
- IT'S A WONDERFUL QUALITY.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.581
( laughs )

08:33.681 --> 08:35.248
- SO WHAT ARE WE EATING?
- JAPANESE.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.117
SO-- OOH, GOD.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.919
UM, THAT'S NOT
GONNA WORK.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.388
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- OH, JEEZ.

08:41.488 --> 08:44.457
OH, LOOK AT THIS.
THEY DIDN'T SECURE THE SOUP.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.193
WHY DIDN'T THEY PUT IT
IN ONE OF THOSE BAGS?

08:46.293 --> 08:48.128
- OH, JESUS.
- OH MY GOD.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.464
THE WHOLE THING IS RUINED.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE IN THE
TAKE-OUT BUSINESS,

08:51.565 --> 08:52.766
YOU GOT TWO THINGS TO DO:

08:52.866 --> 08:54.702
GET THE ORDER RIGHT,
SECURE THE FOOD.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.971
USUALLY THEY'RE GOOD.
I DON'T KNOW.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.073
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING BACK THERE

09:00.173 --> 09:02.275
AND I'M GONNA GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.646
- OH, GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT?
- I'M DEFINITELY GONNA TELL
THEM WHAT HAPPENED.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.882
IT'S FINE, 'CAUSE ACTUALLY
I HAD SUSHI LAST NIGHT, SO...

09:08.982 --> 09:11.051
- YOU HAD SUSHI LAST NIGHT?
- YEAH.

09:11.151 --> 09:14.187
- I DIDN'T EVEN ASK YOU
WHAT I WAS GETTING.
- OH, IT'S FINE.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.023
NO, I LOVE SUSHI.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.491
I'M JUST SAYING IT'S NOT
A HUGE DEAL THAT I DON'T
HAVE IT AGAIN.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.428
- SO WHERE'D YOU GO LAST NIGHT?
- I HAD SUSHI AT YANKEE STADIUM,

09:21.528 --> 09:23.563
WHICH YOU WOULD NOT THINK
IS GOOD SUSHI, BUT IT WAS
ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD SUSHI.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.898
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.433
- SUSHI AT YANKEE STADIUM?
- I KNOW.

09:26.533 --> 09:29.770
I WENT WITH, UM,
THIS FRIEND OF MINE.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.438
SHE'S VERY CONNECTED

09:31.538 --> 09:35.008
AND WE HAD A BOX
TO OURSELVES.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.577
AND THEY BROUGHT IN CATERING
AND WE HAD SUSHI.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.413
- IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
- SO WHO IS THIS PERSON?

09:40.513 --> 09:42.950
JUST THIS--
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.
YOU MIGHT KNOW HER.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.352
UM, I MEAN
IT'S ROSIE O'DONNELL.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.587
I'M SURE YOU'VE PROBABLY
CROSSED PATHS WITH HER.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.657
- NO.
- DO YOU WANT SOME WINE?

09:49.757 --> 09:52.025
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.828
- RED OR WHITE?
- I DON'T CARE.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.936
SO, UM...

10:03.036 --> 10:05.038
WHAT DID--

10:05.138 --> 10:09.576
WHAT DID ROSIE THINK
OF YOUR APARTMENT?

10:09.677 --> 10:10.811
( chuckles )

10:10.911 --> 10:13.981
SHE DIDN'T SEE
MY APARTMENT.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.785
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.319
- SHE WASN'T HERE?
- NO.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.922
OH.
POOR THING.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.791
OH!

10:25.258 --> 10:27.160
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO TELL
YOU IT WAS TRAUMATIC

10:27.260 --> 10:29.596
TO OPEN THAT BAG
AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.198
IT WAS VERY DISTRESSING.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.300
- YOU KNOW,
I WAS ON A DATE...
- YES.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.202
- ...WITH A BI-SEXUAL.
- NO.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.204
AND I'M COMPETING FOR HER
AFFECTION AGAINST A LESBIAN.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.506
- YOU THINK THAT'S EASY?
- SURE SURE. I HAVE A--

10:39.606 --> 10:42.042
DID I MENTION THAT I HAD
A SOUP AND SANDWICH FOR DINNER?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.977
YOU DIDN'T MENTION.
YOU TALK A LOT

10:44.077 --> 10:46.847
BUT NO SANDWICH
MENTIONED.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.282
YOU'VE GOT TO SECURE
THESE BAGS.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.618
SECURE THE BAGS

10:51.719 --> 10:54.855
WITH TAPE, STAPLES,
HOWEVER YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.656
RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.191
SO I GET YOU ANOTHER ORDER

10:58.291 --> 11:02.062
THEN YOU CAN TAKE HOME
AND EVERYTHING BE OKAY?

11:02.162 --> 11:04.364
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT,

11:04.464 --> 11:06.700
BUT THAT'S REALLY NOT QUITE
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

11:06.800 --> 11:10.003
- OH.
- BASICALLY, MAN TO MAN,

11:10.103 --> 11:14.808
I THINK AN APOLOGY
WOULD BE NICE.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.143
OKAY, SO I SAY SORRY,

11:16.243 --> 11:18.245
YOU BELIEVE,
YOU FEEL SOMETHING,

11:18.345 --> 11:21.381
THEN YOU MOVE ON?
YOU GO AWAY?
EVERYTHING OKAY, YEAH?

11:21.481 --> 11:24.117
YEAH, IF I LIKE THE SORRY,
EVERYTHING WILL BE HUNKY-DORY.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.286
OKAY.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.858
I AM SORRY.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.861
OH, THE BOW.
OH MY GOSH.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.796
OH.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.564
I CAN'T QUIBBLE
WITH THE BOW.

11:37.664 --> 11:40.934
I LOVE THAT BOW.
COME ON, HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU
GET A BOW IN YOUR LIFE?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.135
- RIGHT, YES.
- FANTASTIC.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.837
- BOW IS VERY IMPORTANT.
- FANTASTIC.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.839
WE COULD LEARN A LOT
OF THINGS FROM JAPAN.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.842
YOU THINK ABOUT
ON THE WAY HOME.
I THINK, YEAH.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.844
BUT NEXT TIME,
IF I COME BACK AGAIN

11:50.944 --> 11:52.846
TO GET SOME TAKE-OUT,

11:52.946 --> 11:54.915
ARE YOU GONNA BEEF UP
THE SECURITY IN THE BAG?

11:55.015 --> 11:57.050
ABSOLUTELY, SIR.
THE TAPE, STAPLES--

11:57.150 --> 11:59.252
EVERYTHING GONNA BE
SECURED FOR YOU, OKAY?

11:59.352 --> 12:00.788
WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY YOU'VE GOT
THAT TAKE-OUT ORDER--

12:00.888 --> 12:02.622
LISTEN, LISTEN.
YOU SAID A DEAL, RIGHT?

12:02.722 --> 12:06.559
YOU SAID I SAY SORRY,
YOU BELIEVE, YOU MOVE,
YOU GO AWAY, OKAY?

12:06.659 --> 12:10.163
YOU LONG EXPLANATION
HOW SPECIAL BOW IS.
OKAY, WE GOT IT.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.800
NEXT TIME WE SEE YOU COME IN
WE MAKE SURE BAG SECURE.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.602
- VERY SPECIAL FOR YOU, OKAY?
- OKAY. ARE WE GOOD?

12:15.702 --> 12:18.171
- CAN I-- DO I BOW BACK?
- YEAH YEAH. DO.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.743
- THEN YOU GOT THAT TO FOLLOW.
- ( mumbles )

12:23.844 --> 12:26.313
- YOU FOLLOW?
- YES.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.619
- HI.
- HEY.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.988
LARRY DAVID.
LOOK AT THIS.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.624
HEY, ROSIE.
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

12:37.724 --> 12:38.992
SO, LARRY, HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.128
- COULDN'T HAVE GONE BETTER.
- NO KIDDING?

12:41.228 --> 12:43.663
- YES.
- SAME FEELING I HAD.
YOU KNOW THAT?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.332
AND YOU SAW HER WHEN?
MONDAY?

12:45.432 --> 12:48.268
- YES, MONDAY.
- MONDAY? WHO GOES OUT
ON MONDAY?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.170
SOMEONE WHO'S REALLY
DESPERATE TO HAVE A DATE,

12:50.270 --> 12:52.639
I SUPPOSE, CALLS SOMEBODY
FOR A MONDAY NIGHT.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.341
I WON'T TELL HER
THAT YOU SAID THAT.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.576
BUT LISTEN, THE THING--
DID YOU THROW YOUR ARM OUT?

12:56.676 --> 12:58.145
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:58.245 --> 13:00.480
ALL NIGHT LONG I WAS LIKE
IN THIS POSITION.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.483
AND THEN UP FROM THIS SIDE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

13:03.583 --> 13:06.319
- A LOT OF THAT.
- A LOT OF GUYS THINK
THAT'S A GOOD MOVE.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.356
IT'S FUNNY.
USUALLY WOMEN LAUGH AT IT.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.558
- I DON'T THINK
SHE WAS LAUGHING.
- REALLY?

13:11.658 --> 13:13.393
SHE WAS TOO BUSY MOANING
TO LAUGH.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.929
- YEAH, A LOT OF THAT.
- I HAD THE SAME THING
IN MY NECK.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.065
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

13:18.165 --> 13:19.766
COULDN'T MOVE MY NECK
FROM TUESDAY MORNING.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.168
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN, THE THING IS,

13:21.268 --> 13:23.603
SHE JUST TEXTED ME.
WE'RE GOING TO THE TONYS

13:23.703 --> 13:24.972
TOGETHER, OKAY?

13:25.072 --> 13:27.574
- THE TONYS?
- AS MY DATE

13:27.674 --> 13:29.542
TO THE TONY AWARDS.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.044
JANE.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.980
ME TARZAN,
NOT YOU.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.115
- ( laughs )
- THE TONYS.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.917
YOU COULD ASK ANY STRANGER
ON THE STREET,

13:37.017 --> 13:38.785
THEY'LL GO TO THE TONYS.
THAT'S NO GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT.

13:38.886 --> 13:42.589
SHE KNOWS ALL THE WORDS
TO "CATS," OKAY?

13:42.689 --> 13:43.957
EVEN THE BRITISH VERSION.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.059
SHE ENJOYED
"CHESS" THE MUSICAL.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.161
SAW IT THREE TIMES.
SHE SAW "CARRIE."

13:48.261 --> 13:51.198
IT WAS ONLY OPEN TWO NIGHTS.
SHE LIKES BROADWAY, LARRY.

13:51.298 --> 13:55.035
SHE LIKES BROADWAY!
( laughs )

13:55.135 --> 13:57.237
SHE'S GOING TO THE TONYS?
WHAT THE HELL AM I GONNA DO?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.306
YOU CAN'T COMPETE
AGAINST THE TONYS.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.241
I'M DEAD.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.411
( crowd cheering )

14:07.747 --> 14:08.949
GOOD PLAY, LARRY.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.985
ALL RIGHT, LARRY.
TWO AWAY. TWO AWAY.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.554
HA HA.

14:14.654 --> 14:15.889
COME ON, LITTLE LARRY.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.490
HERE WE GO.
HOW'S YOUR ARM?

14:17.590 --> 14:19.692
- GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.
- COME ON, THROW IT TO MOMMY.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.128
LET'S GO, LARRY.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.699
- ( crowd cheering )
- OH, FUCK!

14:26.799 --> 14:29.036
- GO GO GO!
- HA HA, LARRY!

14:29.136 --> 14:31.238
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO RUN, LARRY.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.540
- I CAN WALK.
- GO GO GO!

14:33.640 --> 14:35.943
- OH, DID YOU GET LUCKY.
- SHE'S GOING FOR THIRD, LARRY!

14:36.043 --> 14:38.078
WHERE'S HE THROWING
THE BALL?

14:38.178 --> 14:39.679
SHE'S GOING HOME, LARRY!

14:39.779 --> 14:41.648
OOOH!

14:41.748 --> 14:44.251
WHOO!

14:44.351 --> 14:46.453
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
GOING ON THIS DATE.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.456
I SWEAR TO GOD, I'D LIKE
TO CANCEL RIGHT NOW.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.624
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, MAN.
I WOULD NOT BE A FUCKING FRIEND

14:51.724 --> 14:53.226
SITTING AROUND THIS
PLUSH MOTHERFUCKER

14:53.326 --> 14:55.996
AND ALLOW YOU TO GO OUT
THERE AND ALLOW A LESBIAN

14:56.096 --> 14:59.332
TO BEAT YOU
AT A FUCKING GAME, OKAY?

14:59.432 --> 15:02.035
COME ON, IT'S OVER.
SHE'S TAKING HER TO THE TONYS.

15:02.135 --> 15:06.573
AND LET'S FACE IT,
SHE'S GOT THE LESBIAN
ADVANTAGE.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.175
WE ARE FUCKING MEN, LARRY.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.910
WHAT DO WE HAVE, MAN?
WHAT THE FUCK DO WE HAVE

15:11.011 --> 15:12.445
THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE?

15:12.545 --> 15:14.514
( stammering )
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
THE PENIS.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.583
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.
ROSIE O'DONNELL DOES NOT HAVE--

15:16.683 --> 15:18.851
- HAS NO PENIS.
HAS NO PENIS.
- DOESN'T HAVE A PENIS.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.487
WOMEN DO NOT HAVE PENISES.
MEN HAVE PENISES.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.922
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
DON'T BE A FUCKING VICTIM.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.159
OKAY?
YOU AT BAT.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.295
WHAT'S BELOW
YOUR FUCKING BAT?

15:28.395 --> 15:30.330
WHAT DANGLES
BELOW YOUR BAT?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.099
- HUH?
- BALLS.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.101
- WE GOT BATS AND BALLS, RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

15:34.201 --> 15:37.137
- OKAY, WHAT DO LADIES HAVE?
- GLOVES.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.172
WHAT DO GLOVES DO?
CATCH THE GODDAMN BALLS.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.474
THAT'S WHAT LADIES ON THIS
PLANET DO IS CATCH BALLS.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.576
BATS AND BALLS
RUN THE FUCKING WORLD.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.113
THE WOMAN IS ON THIS EARTH
TO CATCH BALLS.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.048
INTERESTING THEORY.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.150
- SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
- TOO BAD I DON'T HAVE
A DAUGHTER.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.985
I WOULD LIKE TO IMPART
THAT KNOWLEDGE TO HER.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.887
GLOVES DON'T CATCH GLOVES.
WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.724
OKAY? YOU'VE GOT TO
REALIZE THAT THOUGH.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.592
YEAH YEAH, I KNOW.
I KNOW.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.761
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE TONYS HERE, OKAY?

16:01.861 --> 16:04.297
THIS PENIS THAT I HAVE CANNOT
COMPETE WITH THE TONYS.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.766
- TONYS ARE A GRAND SLAM.
- FUCK THE TONYS.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.335
FUCKING TONY.
WHO THE FUCK IS TONY?

16:08.435 --> 16:10.470
WANT A GRAND SLAM?

16:12.939 --> 16:15.008
HMM.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.444
JUICE?

16:19.779 --> 16:21.481
YOU WANT ME TO JUICE?

16:21.581 --> 16:23.216
I WANT YOU TO WIN.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.123
THAT WAS AMAZING.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.260
THE PENIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY
INSTRUMENT, JANE.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.795
- ( laughs )
- SOMETIMES IT SURPRISES
EVEN ME.

16:35.895 --> 16:38.131
AND IT'S NOT JUST
A ONE-TIME THING.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.667
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET ON
A CONSISTENT BASIS WITH ME.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.069
- REALLY?
- ABSOLUTELY.

16:42.169 --> 16:45.172
- I CAN'T EVEN MOVE.
- WELL, SPEAKING OF THAT.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.440
SHALL WE DO THIS AGAIN
ON FRIDAY?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.376
I DON'T WANT
TO WAIT THAT LONG.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.578
- HOW ABOUT THURSDAY?
- THURSDAY?

16:51.678 --> 16:55.248
- I THOUGHT YOU
HAD PLANS ON THURSDAY.
- I'LL CANCEL THEM.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.784
- YOU'LL CANCEL THEM?
- MM-HMM.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.853
WOW.

17:06.426 --> 17:10.097

17:42.695 --> 17:44.231

17:44.331 --> 17:46.866
OH, I NOTICED THAT WHEN
YOU APOLOGIZED TO THIS MAN

17:46.966 --> 17:49.169
YOU GAVE HIM
A RATHER DEEP BOW.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.970
ALMOST 90Â°.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.473
YES, I SPILLED ICE CREAM.

17:53.573 --> 17:57.377
SO I VERY SORRY.
SO I APOLOGIZE TO HIM, YES.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.779
NOW THE OTHER NIGHT A JAPANESE
FELLOW APOLOGIZED TO ME.

17:59.879 --> 18:03.116

DOWN A FEW DEGREES.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.751

18:04.851 --> 18:05.952
- YEAH.

18:06.052 --> 18:09.088
THAT IS NOT APOLOGY TO YOU.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.924
NO, HE WAS NOT
SORRY AT ALL.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.092
- HE WASN'T SORRY?

18:13.193 --> 18:16.062

19:07.146 --> 19:09.849
( huffs )
I DIDN'T KNOW.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.685
IT'S FUNNY 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING DOESN'T FIGURE
OUT OF THE WHOLE THING.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.621
I'VE KNOWN LIKE FOUR DECADES
OF WOMEN THAT YOU'VE DATED.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.190
NONE OF THEM EVER EVER TALKS
ABOUT YOUR PERFORMANCE.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.458
YOU'RE A SINGLES HITTER

19:39.312 --> 19:41.514

19:51.624 --> 19:54.026

19:54.126 --> 19:56.563
I'VE KNOWN YOU
TOO LONG, ALL RIGHT?

19:56.663 --> 19:59.232
SOMETHING JUST

19:59.332 --> 20:02.068
OUTFIELD IN.
PLAY TO FIRST.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.918

20:29.896 --> 20:32.265

20:37.203 --> 20:39.672

21:03.262 --> 21:05.565
( groans )

21:06.699 --> 21:08.501
( grunts )

21:15.608 --> 21:17.477
- Jeff: DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT DUCKSTEIN?
- Larry: NO.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.947
SOME LADY WALKING HER DOG
FOUND HIM ON THE GROUND CHOKING.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.449
- WHAT? IS HE OKAY?
- YEAH.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.651

21:30.723 --> 21:32.925
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I COULD HAVE HELPED HIM.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.894
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.396
SO HOW'S THINGS
WITH JANE?

21:36.496 --> 21:38.631
OH, IT'S FANTASTIC.
SHE LOVES BASEBALL.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.568
- I LOVE THAT.
- SHE'S TAKING ME

21:41.668 --> 21:43.703
SHE BLEW OFF
THE TONYS WITH ROSIE.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.972
- THIS WOMAN
BLEW OFF THE TONYS...
- BLEW OFF THE TONYS.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.074
- ...TO TAKE YOU TO COOPERSTOWN?
- TO TAKE ME TO COOPERSTOWN.

21:48.174 --> 21:51.043
IT'S NOT LIKE BEING WITH A GUY.
IT'S LIKE BEING WITH A GREAT GUY

21:51.143 --> 21:55.515
WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE A VAGINA
AND KNOWS THE STATISTICS OF
WHAT ROY WHITE HIT IN 1971.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.216
- EXACTLY.
- UNBELIEVABLE.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.852
AND I BEAT ROSIE.

22:08.027 --> 22:11.598
HI. HERE TO PICK UP
AN ORDER FOR LARRY DAVID.

22:11.698 --> 22:14.934
OH, IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE.
SHOULD BE READY IN A SECOND.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.440
HELLO.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.642
I GOT THE STAPLER, TAPE.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.511
YOUR SOUP IS--
LOOK AT THIS.

22:24.611 --> 22:28.214
- WOW.

AND NO SPILL IT.

22:28.314 --> 22:29.916
- CAN I TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN?
- YEAH, SURE.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.552
- THAT'S THE TEST.
- YEAH, SURE. TURN DOWN.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.821
WOW.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.556
- GOOD.
- THAT'S HOW YOU RUN
A RESTAURANT.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.491
YOU SECURE
THE TAKE-OUT ORDER.

22:38.591 --> 22:41.394
YOU KNOW, THERE IS
ONE MORE LITTLE ISSUE

22:41.494 --> 22:44.664
I JUST WANTED TO MENTION.
I WAS IN THE PARK

22:44.764 --> 22:47.033
AND THERE WAS
A JAPANESE FELLOW

22:47.133 --> 22:49.035
AND I SAW HIM BOWING,

22:49.135 --> 22:52.171
BUT HE BOWED TO 90Â°.

22:52.271 --> 22:56.375
YOUR BOW
WAS ONLY LIKE 15Â°.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.811
I ASKED HIM ABOUT IT
AND HE SAID

22:58.911 --> 23:01.781
THAT WHAT YOU DID
IS ACTUALLY DISMISSIVE.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.250
SO I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD
LET YOU KNOW ABOUT IT.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.352
SURE
YEAH, THANK YOU.

23:06.453 --> 23:09.055
LISTEN, A BOW IS
A BOW, RIGHT?

23:09.155 --> 23:10.823
NO, HE SAID A BOW
IS NOT A BOW.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.792
- YEAH, A BOW IS A BOW.
- NO, THIS IS NOT A BOW.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.327
YOU WERE SHORT
OF THE AUTHENTIC BOW.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.329
I HAD AUTHENTIC BOW.
BOW IS A BOW.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.466
HE IS NOT AUTHENTIC.
HE DOESN'T KNOW.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.367
IS IT POSSIBLE YOU
DON'T KNOW THE BOW RULES?

23:21.468 --> 23:23.069
BOW RULES?
I UNDERSTAND THE BOW RULES.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.872
- YOU KNOW YOUR BOW RULES?
- I WAS RAISED BY
BOW RULES.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.074
- DID THEY MENTION A DEGREE?
- NO, THEY DIDN'T MENTION DEGREE

23:28.174 --> 23:30.142
BECAUSE A BOW IS A BOW.

23:30.242 --> 23:34.146
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE JAPANESE
GUY IN THE PARK ACTUALLY SAID
ABOUT YOUR BOW?

23:34.246 --> 23:35.548
NO, WHAT DID HE SAY?

23:35.648 --> 23:36.983
- HE SAID...
- YEAH. UH-HUH.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.217
...IT'S A SHIT BOW.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.820
HE SAID SHIT BOW?

23:40.920 --> 23:44.123
YES, THOSE WERE HIS WORDS.
SHIT BOW.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.358
MY BOW IS A SHIT BOW?

23:46.459 --> 23:48.561
I'M NOT SAYING THAT.
LET'S FIND OUT.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.730
I'LL GO ON THE INTERNET,
WE'LL DO A LITTLE RESEARCH,

23:50.830 --> 23:53.933
THEN I'LL COME BACK
AND WE'LL SEE IF

23:54.033 --> 23:55.468
YOUR BOW IS RIGHT.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.537

23:57.637 --> 23:58.971

THERE'S GOOD PLACES HERE.

24:06.679 --> 24:10.016
- I REALLY ENJOY THIS FOOD.
- YEAH, YOU DO.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.485
- YES.

I NEED A PILL.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.524
OH, I'M OUT OF PILLS, MAN.

27:25.544 --> 27:27.513
NO, SERIOUSLY.

27:27.613 --> 27:28.848
I CAN PUT UP THOSE

I HAVE SKILLS.

EVERYBODY'S DOING IT!
I WAS JUST LEVELING
THE PLAYING FIELD!

27:45.597 --> 27:48.234
I'M SORRY!

27:48.334 --> 27:51.237
SO SORRY!

27:53.072 --> 27:55.975
Larry:
ANYWAY, I HEARD ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.277
I REALLY FELT TERRIBLE
AND THOUGHT I SHOULD--

27:58.377 --> 28:00.446
FORGET IT. YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THE IMPORTANT THING IS

28:00.546 --> 28:03.615
WHATEVER BROUGHT YOU HERE
IS NOW THE BEGINNING
OF A FRIENDSHIP.

28:03.716 --> 28:06.385
- I APPROACHED YOU, I ASKED
YOU, YOU LET IT SINK IN...
- MR. DUCKSTEIN.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.955
- LUNCH.
- ...AND HERE WE ARE.
OH, LUNCH TIME.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.923
LUNCH TIME.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING? 1:00.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.759
WHAT DO WE HAVE TODAY?
SALISBURY STEAK.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.727
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO STAY FOR LUNCH?
- NO NO.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.129
THIS COULD BE OUR
FIRST MEAL TOGETHER.
GET MY FRIEND SOME LUNCH.

28:17.229 --> 28:18.798
MY NEW FRIEND SOME LUNCH.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

28:18.898 --> 28:21.400
THIS IS SO IRONIC.
WE'RE HAVING LUNCH AFTER ALL.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.636
TALK ABOUT DESTINY.
I FEEL IT, I KNOW
YOU FEEL IT.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.372
THIS IS GONNA BE THE FIRST

28:26.472 --> 28:28.908
OF GOD KNOWS HOW MANY LUNCHES.
BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEGINNING.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.410
