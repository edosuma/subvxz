00:02.003 --> 00:03.493
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.588 --> 00:05.419
[Charlie] Desmond said I was gonna die.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.838
He told me he has
these flashes, visions.

00:07.925 --> 00:11.588
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,
you were electrocuted.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.421
When you heard Claire was in the water,
you drowned.

00:14.557 --> 00:16.013
l dove in so you never went in!

00:16.100 --> 00:19.467
No matter what I try to do,
you're going to die, Charlie.

00:19.562 --> 00:23.180
[Kate] There's a woman in Hurley's tent
who parachuted onto the island.

00:23.274 --> 00:25.686
The boat she took off from
is 80 miles off the coast

00:25.776 --> 00:29.018
and that if she can find a way
to contact it, we'll all be rescued.

00:29.113 --> 00:32.150
- Why didn't anyone tell me this?
- They don't trust you.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.527
- [Juliet] Kwon is pregnant.
- Where'd you get that?

00:34.619 --> 00:37.110
You're in a position
to be asking us questions?

00:37.205 --> 00:39.287
I told Jack what they were making me do.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.704
Why didn't you tell us?

00:40.791 --> 00:43.453
Because I hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.954
Anyone want to guess
as to what Jack's gonna be showing us

01:22.041 --> 01:23.577
out in the middle of nowhere?

01:23.668 --> 01:25.784
I don't know... stuff?

01:26.545 --> 01:28.581
Probably secret stuff.

01:28.673 --> 01:30.789
Why does everything
have to be a secret?

01:30.883 --> 01:33.420
How about some openness for a change?

01:33.511 --> 01:36.594
- We kept the parachute lady secret.
- That's different.

01:36.681 --> 01:38.137
Different how?

01:38.224 --> 01:41.466
Because we weren't out there
playing football with them.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.347
- What?
- Nothing.

01:44.981 --> 01:48.974
Wait. You had one of your flashes
again, didn't you?

01:50.278 --> 01:52.018
No, Charlie. I didn't.

01:54.532 --> 01:55.692
We're here.

02:08.587 --> 02:13.001
A couple of nights ago, Juliet
came to me and she told me everything.

02:13.843 --> 02:17.085
Ben sent her here to find out
which of our women were pregnant.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.965
You guys were doing tests on us?

02:19.056 --> 02:22.389
No. But that's what he wanted me to do.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.764
I've been leaving tapes
at the medical station.

02:25.855 --> 02:29.313
You all heard what he said.
They're coming tomorrow.

02:30.526 --> 02:33.313
Sun, I'm sorry
that I lied to you.

02:33.738 --> 02:36.229
[Sayid] While I appreciate
your honesty, Jack,

02:36.324 --> 02:39.691
it doesn't explain
why you brought us out here.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.580
Danielle!

02:52.923 --> 02:54.174
Show them.

03:06.771 --> 03:08.477
[all gasp]

03:15.529 --> 03:17.565
When Juliet told me they were coming,

03:18.532 --> 03:20.397
the first thing I thought was,

03:20.493 --> 03:23.030
"Where the hell
are we gonna hide this time?"

03:23.829 --> 03:27.947
But hiding is pointless.
They're just gonna keep coming back.

03:28.042 --> 03:31.000
So I went out and I found some help.

03:31.087 --> 03:35.205
The past few days, she's been bringing
dynamite back from the Black Rock.

03:35.299 --> 03:38.257
For the very first time,
we know exactly what they want,

03:38.344 --> 03:42.383
when they're coming to get it,
and they have no idea

03:42.473 --> 03:44.759
that we're gonna be waiting for them.

03:45.810 --> 03:50.053
So Juliet's gonna mark the tents with
white rocks, just like she was told to.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.768
But there's not gonna be
any pregnant women inside.

03:53.859 --> 03:57.226
There's gonna be plenty
of what we just used on that tree.

03:57.321 --> 04:00.688
So tomorrow night... we stop hiding.

04:00.783 --> 04:03.900
We stop running.
We stop living in fear of them.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.985
Because when they show up...

04:08.499 --> 04:10.660
...we're gonna blow them all to hell.

04:25.975 --> 04:30.765
[music stations changing]

04:32.940 --> 04:37.229
[groans] Bloody hell!
Why are we even doing this?

04:37.319 --> 04:40.811
- Chin up, mate. We're headlining.
- Headlining?

04:40.906 --> 04:43.613
We're playing Clitheroe,
the ass end of nowhere.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.363
A gig's a gig.
We're building our fan base.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.696
Will our fan base
pay for a new sodding tire?

04:49.790 --> 04:53.783
Only if we show up.
So let's just get on with it, shall we?

04:53.878 --> 04:57.791
You know what, Liam?
You get on with it. I quit.

04:57.882 --> 04:59.122
You're giving up?

04:59.216 --> 05:02.253
There's nothing to give up on!
We're broke!

05:02.344 --> 05:04.630
The album's not selling!
We're a joke.

05:04.722 --> 05:06.178
Hey! Shut it!

05:06.765 --> 05:09.142
Listen! [laughs]

05:09.226 --> 05:12.468
[rock music playing]

05:12.563 --> 05:13.803
That's us.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.558
We're on the radio.

05:22.406 --> 05:25.148
- That we are.
- On the bloody radio!

05:28.204 --> 05:29.694
Oh, yeah!

05:29.788 --> 05:31.949
- Hey!
- Oh! I told ya, baby brother.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.906
We're gonna be bloody rock stars!

05:41.425 --> 05:43.507
[Naomi] Can I ask you something?

05:43.594 --> 05:44.925
Yeah.

05:46.138 --> 05:49.005
Who are you people
about to go to war with?

05:49.099 --> 05:52.182
That's a long story.
Want to ask me something else?

05:52.895 --> 05:55.432
- You having a laugh?
- No, of course not.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.515
I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.191
- You're from Manchester, then?
- I am.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.438
My band got its start

06:02.530 --> 06:04.896
at the Night and Day bar
on Oldham Street.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.197
- What band?
- We were called Drive Shaft.

06:07.284 --> 06:11.277
- Yeah, yeah. I know you.
- We had our moment in the sun.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.114
No, not that. The crash.
You're the dead rock star.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.041
They made a big deal out of you
when they found the plane.

06:17.127 --> 06:20.369
- Huge memorial service, new album...
- There's a new album?

06:20.464 --> 06:23.672
Yeah. God, it was everywhere.
A greatest hits thing.

06:29.056 --> 06:33.641
Hey, look on the bright side.
You're not really dead, right?

06:34.979 --> 06:36.139
Yeah, right.

07:00.421 --> 07:04.585
We need more wire so that we can trigger
these from a safe distance.

07:04.675 --> 07:07.587
I can get people to start stripping
the plane wreckage.

07:07.678 --> 07:11.637
We should be able to finish rigging
these tents in the next 24 hours.

07:11.724 --> 07:13.760
We'll be ready by tomorrow night.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.931
- We need to talk about Naomi's phone.
- Not now.

07:22.026 --> 07:25.484
If you are angry I doubted you,
I'll make an apology later. But now...

07:25.571 --> 07:28.028
Look, I'm a little bit
busy right now, Sayid.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.606
And I'm trying
to get us off this island, Jack.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.944
I can't transmit using this phone

07:36.040 --> 07:39.749
because Danielle's distress signal
is overriding the frequency.

07:39.835 --> 07:41.826
If you tell me where the radio tower is,

07:41.920 --> 07:44.411
I can switch off your message
and call for help.

07:44.506 --> 07:48.374
My signal has been playing for the last
16 years and nobody has heard it.

07:48.469 --> 07:53.429
- What makes you think you'll have luck?
- Naomi's boat is 80 miles offshore.

07:53.515 --> 07:56.643
I know if we eliminate
Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.638
No, they won't.

07:58.729 --> 08:01.015
And why is that?

08:01.106 --> 08:02.892
- We're jamming it.
- What?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.974
Ben is using one of the Dharma Stations

08:05.069 --> 08:07.981
to block all of the signals
off of the island except ours.

08:08.072 --> 08:11.280
- What station?
- They call it the Looking Glass.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.076
l have no idea where it is.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.029
I believe I do.

08:20.042 --> 08:23.079
[Claire] Look,
I know Jack thinks it's best,

08:23.170 --> 08:25.411
but what if they're coming
for him again?

08:27.758 --> 08:29.339
Claire, listen to me.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.918
I'm going to protect you.
I'm going to protect Aaron.

08:34.390 --> 08:38.133
I promise.
Everything is going to be fine.

08:42.439 --> 08:44.691
Uh... sorry.

08:44.775 --> 08:47.892
Charlie, can you give me
a hand with something?

08:48.987 --> 08:52.024
Yeah, Desmond, of course.

09:04.795 --> 09:07.411
So, you ready to tell me
what you saw this morning?

09:07.506 --> 09:08.871
Aye.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.133
Right. So how does it happen this time?

09:16.432 --> 09:19.720
Come on, Des.
You can tell me. I can take it.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.269
What I saw, Charlie, was...

09:27.985 --> 09:31.068
...Claire and her baby
getting into a helicopter...

09:31.155 --> 09:36.650
...a helicopter that...
that lifts off, leaves this island.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.873
- Are you sure?
- Aye.

09:45.919 --> 09:50.208
Rescue helicopter? On this beach?
This island? That's what you saw?

09:52.843 --> 09:55.084
We're getting bloody rescued?

09:55.179 --> 09:58.137
I thought you were gonna tell me
l was going to die again!

10:02.728 --> 10:04.343
You are, Charlie.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.565
Wait. What?

10:09.193 --> 10:12.526
If you don't, none if it will happen.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.692
There won't be any rescue.

10:19.495 --> 10:23.454
I'm sorry, brother.
But this time...

10:26.043 --> 10:28.250
This time you have to die.

10:33.509 --> 10:35.750
[pop music playing]

10:37.095 --> 10:40.258
[man] Come on. Come on.

10:41.517 --> 10:44.008
Come on. Come on, Charlie.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.889
Jump in. I'm gonna catch ya, boy.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.063
No. You're just gonna back away.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.232
Don't be daft. Jump in.

10:53.779 --> 10:57.146
- No!
- I promise. I'm gonna catch ya!

10:57.241 --> 10:58.981
No, he won't!

10:59.076 --> 11:00.566
Zip it, you!

11:01.912 --> 11:05.530
Don't listen to your brother.
Justjump on in.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.618
There's nothing
to be afraid of, Charlie.

11:10.712 --> 11:14.546
l'll catch ya. I promise.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.306
[gasps]

11:36.905 --> 11:38.770
I did it!

11:39.575 --> 11:41.657
- You got it!
- I did it!

11:41.743 --> 11:45.406
You're swimming, Charlie!
You're swimming!

11:51.962 --> 11:53.498
What're you writing?

12:00.554 --> 12:01.669
Nothing.

12:09.605 --> 12:11.721
All right, tell me.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.144
You sure you want to know?

12:17.613 --> 12:21.982
- It might be easier if you just...
- Yeah. I want to know.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.950
You're inside a hatch. lt's...

12:30.375 --> 12:32.161
...a room full of equipment.

12:32.878 --> 12:36.166
There's a blinking yellow light
above a switch.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.121
You flick the switch.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.672
The light goes off.

12:47.351 --> 12:48.966
And then you drown.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.357
VVhen?

13:04.201 --> 13:05.407
I don't know.

13:05.494 --> 13:08.952
You're sure you saw Claire and Aaron
get on that helicopter?

13:09.039 --> 13:10.279
Aye.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.415
So...

13:15.671 --> 13:18.413
...before I... drown,

13:19.883 --> 13:21.544
| just have to flick the switch?

13:23.428 --> 13:24.543
That's right.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.640
Where is it then?

13:34.731 --> 13:38.644
This is the Looking Glass.
It's an undenivater Dharma station.

13:38.735 --> 13:42.148
Please, can you tell me anything
you might know about this place?

13:42.239 --> 13:45.231
I've never been down there.
I don't know anyone who has.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.111
Why not?

13:47.744 --> 13:51.987
There was some accident. Ben told us
that the station was completely flooded.

13:52.082 --> 13:55.745
- If it's flooded how does it work?
- How it still works is irrelevant.

13:55.836 --> 13:58.327
The question is
how do we get it to stop working,

13:58.422 --> 14:00.333
so we can use the satellite phone.

14:02.634 --> 14:06.798
The diagram shows that the Looking Glass
is connected to the island by a cable.

14:06.888 --> 14:10.096
lfeel sure that this is
the very same cable down the beach

14:10.183 --> 14:11.593
which runs into the ocean.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.643
If we follow the cable,
it should lead us to the station.

14:14.730 --> 14:18.097
- So how're we gonna get in?
- We swim in.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.476
There's a moon pool,

14:19.568 --> 14:22.605
a room with an open floor
at the base of the station,

14:22.696 --> 14:24.982
big enough for a submarine to dock.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.654
Even if the station's flooded,

14:26.742 --> 14:29.825
I think I'll be able to find
the relay switch and disable it.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.572
What about swimming back out?

14:32.956 --> 14:34.196
No.

14:34.291 --> 14:38.000
I'm not letting you go on some
suicide mission just to flip the switch.

14:38.086 --> 14:40.998
Someone has to do it,
or we'll never leave this island.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.465
I'll do it.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.882
Swim down, turn off that switch,
swim back up. Piece of cake.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.176
You don't know what we're talking about.

14:48.263 --> 14:51.801
l was junior swim champion.
I can hold my breath for four minutes.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.725
I know exactly
what you're talking about, Jack.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.639
No. And there's no reason
to do this now.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.440
We're gonna focus on the Others,

15:02.527 --> 15:04.188
- then deal with this.
- Wait.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.235
We have a chance
to signal for a rescue.

15:06.323 --> 15:09.611
For 90 days, I've been asked
to make decisions for this camp.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.942
There you go. I just made one.

15:21.213 --> 15:24.250
Rose, that's a sailor's hitch.
It's not gonna hold.

15:24.341 --> 15:27.674
- You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.
- Now you're a knot expert?

15:27.761 --> 15:30.719
Well, trust me, it's...

15:34.518 --> 15:36.600
How did you do that?

15:36.686 --> 15:39.348
Watch and learn, dear, watch and learn.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.862
[speaks Korean]

16:43.336 --> 16:46.499
Hey! Look, there! Look!

17:02.772 --> 17:05.354
- Get off him! It's OK!
- What?! He's one of them!

17:05.442 --> 17:07.558
I know! I know, it's OK.

17:09.070 --> 17:12.688
He was in the cage next to me!
I know this guy!

17:12.782 --> 17:15.444
What the hell are you doing here, Karl?

17:15.535 --> 17:18.618
They're... coming. My people...

17:18.705 --> 17:21.321
Sorry you came all this way,
but we already know.

17:21.416 --> 17:22.872
Then why are you still here?

17:22.959 --> 17:25.746
When your people
show up here tomorrow, we're ready.

17:25.837 --> 17:29.079
Tomorrow? No!
No, they're coming tonight!

17:35.805 --> 17:37.796
They're coming right now!

17:46.316 --> 17:47.726
Hey!

17:50.987 --> 17:53.319
- When'd you get back?
- Just now.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.694
Where's Locke?

17:59.704 --> 18:01.080
Here's your gun back.

18:06.461 --> 18:09.077
- Ben, what's going on?
- Where's Ryan?

18:09.172 --> 18:12.164
- He's at his tent. Are you alone?
- It's time to get them.

18:12.968 --> 18:16.756
- Wait a minute. But you said tomorrow.
- Jacob wants it to happen now.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.053
What happened out there?
Did John see...?

18:19.140 --> 18:20.676
John had an accident.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.926
- Ryan!
- Yes, sir.

18:25.939 --> 18:29.397
If you leave now, how long
will it take you to reach their camp?

18:29.484 --> 18:32.066
If I take my ten best
we can hit them by nightfall.

18:32.153 --> 18:35.611
- Then you better get going.
- No, Ben. Moving up the schedule...

18:35.699 --> 18:37.610
Juliet may not be ready. What if...

18:37.701 --> 18:39.817
Then we'll take all their women.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.744
And we'll sort out
the ones we need later.

18:43.832 --> 18:44.947
And the men?

18:45.041 --> 18:48.875
If any of them are stupid enough
to get in your way, kill them.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.078
All right.

19:03.226 --> 19:05.012
Karl!

19:06.688 --> 19:08.178
It's me.

19:11.568 --> 19:15.060
- I thought you were bringing rabbit.
- You have to go. Now.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.986
What? Did he find out I was out here?

19:17.073 --> 19:19.906
No. He's sending Pryce
to their beach camp right now.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.608
- You warn them!
- Warn them?

19:21.703 --> 19:24.285
- Go now!
- They were gonna take pregnant women.

19:24.372 --> 19:27.614
Take the outrigger, you'll get there
a few hours before them.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.576
- Wait, Alex.
- He's gonna kill them, Karl!

19:33.048 --> 19:36.540
Austen and Ford saved your life.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.010
You owe them.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.848
You'd better take this.

19:49.064 --> 19:51.430
If I get caught,
your father's gonna kill me.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.185
Is he my father?

20:02.077 --> 20:03.783
Now, go.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.637
- Is that everything?
- Yeah.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.234
Do you trust him?

20:35.318 --> 20:37.650
You don't trust me? What about her?

20:37.737 --> 20:40.069
She's a spy.

20:40.156 --> 20:43.990
She's supposed to mark the tents
of the pregnant women with white rocks.

20:44.077 --> 20:47.319
They know, Karl. But, thanks.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.914
- So what're we gonna do?
- We have to leave now, hide.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.538
Where? It's their island.
If they wanna kill us, they'll find us.

20:55.964 --> 20:59.252
Sun's gonna go down in a few hours.
We have enough wire yet?

20:59.342 --> 21:00.422
Not even close.

21:00.510 --> 21:03.172
We gotta figure out a way
to set the dynamite off.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.379
- We can shoot.
- We don't have enough guns.

21:05.473 --> 21:08.306
- He said that ten of them are coming.
-The tents.

21:08.393 --> 21:10.805
We camouflage the dynamite
next to the tents,

21:10.895 --> 21:13.386
target it from our positions
at the tree line.

21:14.441 --> 21:18.684
Juliet marked three tents.
That means we need three guns.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.019
- Whoa!
- Here. You can have mine, too.

21:23.074 --> 21:24.939
I'll be your third.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.526
We'll take your gun,
but you're not staying here.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.122
You're gonna lead everyone
to the radio tower.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.745
Radio tower?

21:34.836 --> 21:38.124
We can't risk losing the chance
to contact with Naomi's boat.

21:38.214 --> 21:41.206
So everything has to happen
at the same time.

21:43.303 --> 21:46.761
Charlie, you still up for a swim?

21:50.185 --> 21:51.595
Yeah, I believe I am.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.353
I'll go with him.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.352
OK. We better get to it.

22:10.288 --> 22:11.778
[door opens]

22:11.873 --> 22:13.579
[Liam] Ho ho ho.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.458
It's here, baby brother!
Christmas is here!

22:18.922 --> 22:22.005
Oi. Are these the birds from row two?

22:24.010 --> 22:25.420
Well done, mate.

22:31.434 --> 22:33.675
Well, as you have spent another year

22:33.770 --> 22:36.307
as the only drug-free rock star
in the world,

22:36.397 --> 22:39.104
I am going to share
a little known fact with you.

22:41.486 --> 22:44.694
Father Christmas lives
just down the street from here.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.773
- Father Christmas lives in Helsinki?
- Indeed he does.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.153
In case you haven't noticed,
baby brother,

22:50.245 --> 22:54.204
Finland is the bloody North Pole.

22:54.290 --> 22:58.954
Therefore, a very special gift for you
this year.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.878
Liam, no. Mum gave you that.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.551
You're the first born.

23:08.638 --> 23:11.550
It was her father's
and his father before that...

23:11.641 --> 23:13.097
And it's a family heirloom,

23:13.184 --> 23:16.768
and that's why we named the band
after Dexter bloody Stratton. I know.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.061
But Charlie, let's be honest.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.474
We both know I'm a sodding mess.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.981
But you, you're different.

23:25.071 --> 23:29.155
You're gonna get married,
have a family, a baby.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.651
- I'll be lucky if I hit 30.
- Don't say that, Li.

23:33.746 --> 23:37.330
The ring has to stay
in the family, Charlie.

23:38.334 --> 23:41.997
So please, take it.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.379
Mum would've wanted it this way.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.752
Pass it on to your little one someday.

23:47.844 --> 23:50.381
I need to know it's safe.

23:57.061 --> 23:59.268
I'll hold on to it.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.682
But I won't take it.

24:06.738 --> 24:10.105
Hey, it fits. Look at that.

24:10.199 --> 24:12.155
Happy Christmas, baby brother.

24:43.733 --> 24:45.018
You need some help?

24:46.486 --> 24:48.977
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to do this?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.450
I didn't want you to worry.

24:58.039 --> 25:01.907
Well, it's dangerous, isn't it,
swimming into some underwater station?

25:02.001 --> 25:05.744
It's what needs to be done
to get us all rescued.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.081
I'll be fine, Claire.

25:10.510 --> 25:12.375
You gotta promise me something.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.261
While I'm gone...

25:18.226 --> 25:19.682
...don't worry about me.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.187
OK.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.485
[baby cries]

25:32.907 --> 25:34.113
I'll take him.

25:36.244 --> 25:37.359
Thanks.

25:38.413 --> 25:39.994
Hey...

25:41.040 --> 25:42.701
[Claire coos]

25:44.460 --> 25:46.712
All right, turnip head.

25:47.797 --> 25:52.166
You take care of your mum,
while I'm away, OK?

26:01.644 --> 26:03.054
I love you.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.491
See you soon.

26:27.462 --> 26:30.920
Be careful, Charlie. OK?

26:31.007 --> 26:32.247
Yeah.

27:09.086 --> 27:13.375
[J‘ Oasis: Wonderwall]

27:19.222 --> 27:22.589
[thunderclap]

27:25.937 --> 27:28.223
I'm sorry, guys.
Thanks, man.

27:38.449 --> 27:40.735
[woman] Help! Help me!

27:40.827 --> 27:45.287
Help! Please! Please!

27:45.957 --> 27:47.037
Oi!

27:47.917 --> 27:49.657
- You, stop!
- Hey!

27:49.752 --> 27:51.583
Get the hell away from her!

27:52.255 --> 27:54.746
What're you doing? Leave her alone!

27:57.635 --> 27:59.216
You OK, miss?

27:59.303 --> 28:01.680
Yes. I think so, yes.

28:03.558 --> 28:05.173
Here you go.

28:06.269 --> 28:08.225
Pardon me while I have a heart attack.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.928
Last time I was in a fight,
I was eight years old.

28:13.276 --> 28:14.686
And I lost.

28:15.611 --> 28:19.775
Well, that makes you
even more of a hero, doesn't it?

28:19.866 --> 28:24.530
- I just did what anyone would do.
- Three people walked by the alley.

28:25.413 --> 28:26.994
- What?
- They saw me...

28:27.081 --> 28:29.367
...but they just kept on going.

28:31.419 --> 28:33.626
You are a hero, sir.

28:33.713 --> 28:37.877
And don't let anyone
ever tell you differently.

28:37.967 --> 28:40.208
[thunderclap]

28:53.983 --> 28:55.848
- What's that?
- It's a weight belt.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.810
It should bring you down
quicker than swimming.

28:59.989 --> 29:01.479
Well, every second counts.

29:03.326 --> 29:05.362
So ljust take it off when I hit bottom,

29:05.453 --> 29:09.037
swim up through the moon pool
into the station,

29:10.166 --> 29:14.000
swim into whichever room has
the yellow blinking switch,

29:14.837 --> 29:15.952
flip it.

29:18.716 --> 29:20.047
Nothing to it.

29:24.597 --> 29:27.259
So how long can you really
hold your breath for?

29:33.522 --> 29:35.433
[gunfire]

29:38.736 --> 29:41.944
- You want me to hit another one?
- No. You've made your point.

29:42.031 --> 29:45.023
Bernard, this is not pheasant hunting
in Montgomery.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.779
- I know what I'm doing.
- Pheasants don't shoot back.

29:47.870 --> 29:51.954
Nothing's gonna happen to me, Rose.
I just have to shoot a tent.

29:52.041 --> 29:55.625
- And I'll be right behind you.
- Then I'm staying, too.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.417
No, you're not, Rose.

29:58.881 --> 30:01.793
Everyone's gathering down
at the south end of the beach.

30:01.884 --> 30:04.296
- No one's staying but the shooters.
- Says who?

30:04.387 --> 30:08.175
You wanna give me your word that
nothing's gonna happen to my husband?

30:08.265 --> 30:09.641
Then I'll go.

30:11.519 --> 30:14.932
If we don't kill everyone
who shows up here in about an hour,

30:15.022 --> 30:17.183
it's not gonna matter where Bernard is.

30:18.734 --> 30:23.649
I like you better since you got back,
Jack. You're almost an optimist.

30:23.739 --> 30:24.774
Come on.

30:24.865 --> 30:28.904
If you're gonna be hiding in the bushes,
let's get you into something dark.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.241
You better get going.

30:33.332 --> 30:36.244
Rousseau says it's a day's walk
up to the radio tower.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.576
I'm not taking them to the tower,
you are.

30:40.923 --> 30:43.209
- Excuse me?
- You're not staying behind.

30:44.635 --> 30:47.297
- This was my idea.
- I'm capable of executing it.

30:47.388 --> 30:50.255
- I owe them!
- What are you more concerned with?

30:50.349 --> 30:53.682
Killing the Others
or getting our people off this island?

30:55.771 --> 30:58.183
This afternoon
you said you were our leader.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.227
It's time for you to act like one.

31:09.243 --> 31:12.155
Lead them to the radio tower, Jack.

31:13.998 --> 31:15.784
And then take us all home.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.797
Dudes! Wait!

31:31.640 --> 31:32.891
I heard.

31:32.975 --> 31:36.058
I heard what you're doing.
I wanna come with.

31:38.439 --> 31:42.557
Everyone, they're all goin'
to the radio tower,

31:42.651 --> 31:46.519
and I'm sick of trekking,
and, you know, explosions.

31:48.032 --> 31:51.945
I think I can help you guys out.
I'm a really good paddler.

31:58.667 --> 31:59.873
You can't go, Hurley.

32:01.504 --> 32:02.710
Why not?

32:05.466 --> 32:06.831
Because...

32:09.053 --> 32:12.716
...you're too big.
You won't fit in the boat.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.104
That's uncool, man.

32:24.944 --> 32:28.528
Wait! Wait! Wait!

32:30.533 --> 32:33.821
Dude. It's fine. Idon't even
wanna go on your stupid boat.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.365
I'll catch up with you later.

32:42.044 --> 32:45.502
- Just remember I love you, man.
- Yeah, whatever. I love you, too.

33:02.523 --> 33:04.354
You got water in there? Good. Good.

33:04.775 --> 33:07.107
How about you? Lot of water? Good.

33:08.404 --> 33:09.484
Hey.

33:10.781 --> 33:13.488
- Hey.
- So here we go again.

33:15.244 --> 33:17.235
Here we go again.

33:20.124 --> 33:24.117
- The tents are all marked. We're set.
- Sayid find a third shooter?

33:35.181 --> 33:37.672
Ready, Claire?
Need a hand with the little guy?

33:37.766 --> 33:39.722
Uh, no thanks, I'm OK.

33:46.942 --> 33:49.319
How's my little sweetheart?

33:52.031 --> 33:55.398
We're just gonna go for a little walk,
so hold on to Mum, OK?

34:19.183 --> 34:20.764
This is it.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.769
Ready?

35:43.058 --> 35:44.559
Hiya.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.634
Do you want a blanket?

35:46.729 --> 35:48.094
Oh, thanks, I've got one.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.393
Well, you're warming for two. Take mine.

35:54.111 --> 35:55.226
Thank you.

36:04.371 --> 36:07.363
So, first plane crash?

36:08.792 --> 36:12.410
- What gave it away?
- You can always spot the newbies.

36:17.426 --> 36:19.587
We're gonna be OK, you know.

36:21.055 --> 36:22.591
Are we?

36:22.681 --> 36:26.265
We're alive, on a beautiful island.

36:27.478 --> 36:29.093
We'll sleep under the stars,

36:29.188 --> 36:33.181
and before you know it, the helicopters
will come and take us all home.

36:34.443 --> 36:36.229
You really think they'll find us?

36:37.321 --> 36:39.437
Well, yeah, why wouldn't they?

36:41.116 --> 36:42.322
Thanks.

36:45.204 --> 36:47.570
- I'm Charlie.
- I'm Claire.

36:48.624 --> 36:51.411
- Nice to meet you, Charlie.
- It's nice to meet you.

37:12.815 --> 37:14.771
We're here.

37:25.327 --> 37:27.739
I want you to give this
to Claire for me.

37:33.669 --> 37:35.250
What is it?

37:39.508 --> 37:42.545
It's the five best moments of my...

37:43.512 --> 37:45.878
...sorry excuse for a life.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.177
My greatest hits.

37:55.524 --> 37:57.515
You know...

38:00.279 --> 38:04.443
...memories... are all I've got.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.191
You don't have to do this, Charlie.

38:09.371 --> 38:10.531
What?

38:12.749 --> 38:16.788
- I'll go.
- No, your flashes...

38:16.879 --> 38:20.918
Maybe I keep seeing you die
because...

38:22.885 --> 38:25.171
...I'm supposed to take your place.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.801
What about your girl? Penny?

38:36.273 --> 38:37.729
What about your girl?

38:42.237 --> 38:43.693
Besides...

38:47.826 --> 38:50.533
...I might be luckier than you.

38:59.129 --> 39:00.915
Keep your memories to yourself.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.594
I'll take it from here.

39:14.269 --> 39:15.679
I don't know what to say.

39:19.316 --> 39:21.773
Well, you can tell me
where the weight belt is.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.730
Right there behind you.

39:50.973 --> 39:55.763
You and I both know you're not
supposed to take my place, brother.

40:02.192 --> 40:04.979
[exhales deeply]

41:49.466 --> 41:52.549
[laughing]

42:00.310 --> 42:04.144
I'm alive. I'm alive!

42:05.273 --> 42:08.356
- [metallic door clangs open]
- [cocks gun]

42:15.909 --> 42:18.241
[rifle cocking]
