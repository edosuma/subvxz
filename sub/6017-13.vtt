WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:04.093
We never should have
landed a man on the moon.

00:05.438 --> 00:06.632
It's a mistake.

00:06.806 --> 00:09.331
Now everything is compared
to that one accomplishment.

00:09.509 --> 00:12.568
Everybody goes, "I can't believe
they can land a man on the moon...

00:12.746 --> 00:14.680
...and taste my coffee."

00:14.848 --> 00:17.646
We would've been happier if we
hadn't landed a man on the moon.

00:17.817 --> 00:20.980
We'd go, "They can't make a
prescription bottle that'll open easily?

00:21.154 --> 00:26.285
I'm not surprised they couldn't land on
the moon. Things make perfect sense."

00:26.860 --> 00:29.761
Neil Armstrong should've said,
"That's one small step for man...

00:29.929 --> 00:34.161
...one giant leap for every whining,
complaining SOB on the Earth."

00:40.473 --> 00:43.271
Hey, do you believe I got
"Happy New Year'd" today?

00:43.476 --> 00:44.807
It's February.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.776
I once got
"Happy New Year'd" in March.

00:47.947 --> 00:50.575
-It's disgusting.
-It's pathetic.

00:51.684 --> 00:53.549
-Hey, is it cold out?
-Really cold.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.156
-Scary cold?
-What's your definition of scary cold?

00:58.024 --> 00:59.252
Hi.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.395
That.

01:07.100 --> 01:10.297
What is that?

01:10.570 --> 01:12.470
-What?
-When did you get that?

01:12.639 --> 01:16.075
This week. My father got
a deal from a friend of his.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.176
It's Gore-Tex.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.969
You know about Gore-Tex?

01:20.413 --> 01:22.540
You like saying Gore-Tex,
don't you?

01:22.715 --> 01:26.276
Look at you. You can't even
turn around in that thing.

01:26.486 --> 01:27.817
Look at this.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.751
Hey, George, can you feel this?
Can you..?

01:33.193 --> 01:35.855
All right, all right! Knock it off.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.925
Come on, let's go.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.261
We should stop off on the way
and get a bottle of wine or something.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.026
What for?

01:43.203 --> 01:46.331
These people invited us for dinner.
We have to bring something.

01:46.706 --> 01:48.196
Why?

01:48.741 --> 01:51.175
Because it's rude otherwise.

01:52.145 --> 01:54.443
You mean just going there
because I'm invited...

01:54.614 --> 01:56.206
...that's rude?
-Yes.

01:56.382 --> 01:59.010
You're telling me, instead of them
being happy to see me...

01:59.185 --> 02:01.779
...they'll be upset because
I didn't bring anything.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.183
You see what I'm saying?

02:03.356 --> 02:05.688
The fabric of society
is very complex, George.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.785
I don't even drink wine.
I drink Pepsi.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.124
You can't bring Pepsi.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.194
Why not?

02:14.701 --> 02:15.998
Because we're adults.

02:16.836 --> 02:19.703
What, you're telling me that wine
is better than Pepsi?

02:19.873 --> 02:22.637
No way wine is better than Pepsi.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.037
George, I don't think
we wanna walk in there...

02:25.211 --> 02:28.647
...and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi
in the middle of the table.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.750
I don't like the idea that any time
there's a dinner invitation...

02:31.918 --> 02:33.977
...there's this annoying little chore.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.816
You're getting to be
an annoying little chore yourself.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.883
All right, let's go. Who's driving?

02:41.060 --> 02:43.927
You are. I can't get that thing
in my car.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.923
Where's the heat in this car?
Come on. Warm me up.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.696
-It's cold. Give us a little squeeze.
-Get off of me.

02:51.871 --> 02:55.034
Get off of... Get off of me.

02:55.975 --> 02:57.806
You're comfortable up there,
bubble boy.

02:57.977 --> 03:01.242
Oh, yeah.
You wish you had this coat.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.780
I was just thinking,
the four of us can't show up...

03:03.950 --> 03:06.680
...with just one bottle of wine.
-Oh, here we go.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.787
-What?
-Why don't we get them a couch.

03:08.955 --> 03:11.753
We'll rent a U-Haul.
We'll bring them a nice sectional.

03:11.925 --> 03:15.258
We should bring some cake.
Will you stop off at the bakery?

03:15.428 --> 03:18.591
Why don't you just get some
Ring Dings from the liquor store.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.062
Ring Dings?

03:20.333 --> 03:22.699
Ring Dings are better
than anything at a bakery.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.268
I like Ring Dings.

03:24.437 --> 03:26.701
George, you can't show up
at someone's house...

03:26.873 --> 03:29.171
...with Ring Dings and Pepsi.

03:29.342 --> 03:32.072
Hey, your lights are on!

03:33.313 --> 03:35.975
It's a funeral procession.

03:37.684 --> 03:40.244
I got news for you.
I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi...

03:40.420 --> 03:41.819
...I'm the hit of the party.

03:41.988 --> 03:44.115
People would be coming up,
"Between you and me...

03:44.290 --> 03:46.986
...I'm really excited about
the Ring Dings and the Pepsi."

03:47.160 --> 03:50.687
What are we, Europeans, with
the Beaujolais and the chardonnay?

03:51.097 --> 03:53.588
Oh, Kramer, that's the bakery.
Stop here. Stop here.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.233
-All right.
-Okay, let me out.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.232
-You, whatever your name is.
-Jerry.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.870
Yeah, Jerry. Come with me.

03:59.038 --> 04:01.438
We'll get the wine,
pick you up here in 10 minutes?

04:01.608 --> 04:02.836
-Yeah.
-All right.

04:07.013 --> 04:08.674
I love the smell of bakeries.

04:08.848 --> 04:11.009
Look, Elaine,
the black-and-white cookie.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.981
I love the black-and-white.

04:13.319 --> 04:17.084
Two races of flavor living
side by side in harmony.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.452
It's a wonderful thing, isn't it?

04:19.659 --> 04:22.685
You know, I often wonder what you'll
be like when you're senile.

04:24.063 --> 04:27.521
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Yeah. It'll be a very smooth transition.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.031
Thank you.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.834
All right.
What are we getting?

04:31.337 --> 04:33.362
Chocolate babka.
That's their specialty.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.400
-Love that babka.
-Yeah, yeah.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.874
But listen. Elaine,
when we get up to the door...

04:39.045 --> 04:40.774
...you hold the cake box.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.578
-Why?
-I don't know.

04:42.749 --> 04:46.207
Just standing there with a box,
holding it by the little string...

04:47.186 --> 04:50.747
-You think it's effeminate?
-It's a tad dainty.

04:52.225 --> 04:54.352
Oh, we forgot to pick a number.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.324
See, that's not fair. We were here
ahead of all these people.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.155
You think I should go
and ask her for hers?

05:00.333 --> 05:02.460
-No, forget it.
-No, no, no. It's not fair.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.832
Just because they have a ticket
doesn't mean they were here first.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.269
We were ahead of them
and them and her.

05:08.441 --> 05:11.308
Come on, let's just go
ask them. Come on.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.072
Excuse me.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.505
Well, I'm not finding a spot here.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.212
What do you wanna do?

05:19.385 --> 05:20.613
-Just double-park.
-No.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.652
-Why not?
-I'll get a ticket.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.653
What if somebody wants
to get out of here?

05:24.824 --> 05:27.554
People get spaces this good,
they never give them up.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.957
That's a fallacy.

05:30.129 --> 05:31.460
All right, I tell you what.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.096
Go into the store,
and I'll wait in the car.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.861
Why don't you go into the store,
and I'll wait in the car?

05:37.203 --> 05:39.000
Because I've got the coat.

05:39.172 --> 05:43.939
-I can sit in the car and not get cold.
-I'll leave the car heater running.

05:44.110 --> 05:47.409
-Does the heater work in this car?
-No.

05:48.781 --> 05:52.182
There's a spot right in front
of the liquor store. You see? You see?

05:55.688 --> 05:58.623
-But we were here ahead of you.
-How do I know that?

05:58.791 --> 06:00.281
Well, we saw you come in.

06:00.460 --> 06:03.293
-Well, that's easy for you to say.
-Oh, yeah, right.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.760
That's something I do.

06:04.931 --> 06:08.128
I make up stories to get ahead
in lines at bakeries.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.496
Forty-six.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.567
Wait. Wait a second.

06:14.741 --> 06:16.368
Are you Barbara Benedict?

06:16.943 --> 06:18.570
Yes.

06:19.078 --> 06:20.636
Oh, my God.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.815
I don't... I know you.

06:22.982 --> 06:24.779
I'm... I'm Elaine Benes.

06:24.951 --> 06:28.216
Do you remember? We met
at Linda van Grak's baby shower.

06:28.454 --> 06:30.217
I'm on my way over there right now.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.549
Yeah, me too.

06:32.725 --> 06:36.456
-You're Jerry, right?
-David.

06:40.199 --> 06:42.064
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?

06:42.535 --> 06:44.059
Yes, it is.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.136
You know, we were here
ahead of you.

06:49.542 --> 06:52.909
-You're not getting my number.
-So you still don't believe us.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.479
-Forty-seven.
-That's us.

06:55.648 --> 06:58.139
Oh, okay, fine. Fine.
Go ahead. But listen.

06:58.317 --> 07:00.114
As soon as I get there...

07:00.286 --> 07:03.414
...I'm gonna tell everyone
what a jerk you are.

07:03.589 --> 07:07.889
I'll be there ahead of you and I'll
be telling them what a jerk you are.

07:08.528 --> 07:11.019
I'll have the chocolate babka.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.964
You're lucky, Mrs. Benedict.
It's our last one.

07:19.972 --> 07:23.135
All right, what are we getting?
It's hot in here.

07:23.976 --> 07:26.968
What do you say
we get a Mouton Cadet?

07:27.146 --> 07:29.171
-What's that?
-It's a Bordeaux.

07:29.348 --> 07:32.545
Robust, bold, very dry...

07:32.718 --> 07:36.484
...as opposed to a Beaujolais,
which is richer and fruitier.

07:38.157 --> 07:42.287
-All right, here's one. Twelve dollars.
-Twelve dollars?

07:42.562 --> 07:46.328
We should've gone to the bakery.
They're not getting no 12-dollar cake.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.797
I'll pay you back later.
I don't have my wallet.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:57.176 --> 08:00.111
-Why not?
-I don't like to carry my wallet.

08:00.279 --> 08:03.646
My osteopath says
that it's bad for my spine.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.841
Throws my hips off-kilter.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.481
Throws your hips off-kilter.

08:11.023 --> 08:14.083
-So where's your money?
-I never take it.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.922
-So, what do you do?
-Oh, I get by.

08:19.866 --> 08:21.094
See you later.

08:21.267 --> 08:23.428
-See you later.
-See you later.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.831
That's the last babka.
They got the last babka.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.530
I know. They're going in first
with the last babka.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.538
-That was our babka.
-You can't beat babka.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.575
We had that babka.

08:32.745 --> 08:34.212
They're gonna be heroes.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.577
So, what now? If we can't get the
babka, the whole thing's useless.

08:37.884 --> 08:40.784
-Well, how about a carrot cake?
-Carrot cake?

08:40.953 --> 08:44.912
Why is that a cake? You don't
make carrots into a cake, I'm sorry.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.287
-Black Forest?
-Black Forest? Too scary.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.122
You're in the forest.

08:52.131 --> 08:54.429
-Hey, how about a napoleon?
-Napoleon?

08:54.600 --> 08:57.865
Who's he to have a cake?
He was a ruthless warmonger.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.368
Might as well get a Mengele.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.468
That was our babka.
We had that babka.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.374
-What's this one?
-That? Cinnamon babka.

09:08.781 --> 09:10.942
Another babka?

09:12.285 --> 09:14.947
There's chocolate,
and there's cinnamon.

09:15.121 --> 09:16.588
Well, we gotta get the cinnamon.

09:16.756 --> 09:20.624
Yeah, but they got the chocolate.
We'll be going in with lesser babka.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.260
I beg your pardon.

09:22.428 --> 09:25.420
Cinnamon takes a back seat
to no babka.

09:26.032 --> 09:29.627
People love it. It should be on tables in
restaurants with salt and pepper.

09:29.802 --> 09:32.032
Someone says,
"This is so good. What's in this?"

09:32.204 --> 09:36.368
The answer comes back, "Cinnamon,
cinnamon," again and again.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.875
Lesser babka? I think not.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.847
Forty-nine.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.074
I'll have a cinnamon babka.

09:46.385 --> 09:48.319
And a black-and-white cookie
for me.

09:48.654 --> 09:50.212
Peace.

09:53.492 --> 09:54.857
That'll be 13.05.

09:55.828 --> 09:57.090
All right, here you go.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.925
A hundred. I can't change that.

10:00.199 --> 10:04.158
-You can't? All right, let's go.
-Wait a second.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.598
I can get change.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.900
Hey, anybody got change
for a hundred?

10:12.078 --> 10:13.739
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

10:13.913 --> 10:15.540
-You're gonna get us killed.
-What?

10:15.715 --> 10:18.809
Don't go shouting we got a $100 bill.
People will be all over us.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.976
Let's buy something
and we'll get change.

10:21.153 --> 10:23.553
I am not buying something
just to get change.

10:23.723 --> 10:26.886
George, there's a newsstand right
over there. Now, come on.

10:32.064 --> 10:35.727
-What are we doing?
-Just get some gum or something.

10:38.871 --> 10:40.736
Pack of gum. Here you go.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.806
What, it's a hundred?
I can't change a hundred.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.872
-Why not?
-You gotta buy more than that.

10:47.747 --> 10:49.442
Here. Get a newspaper.

10:49.615 --> 10:51.583
-Newspaper.
-Not enough.

10:53.219 --> 10:54.982
Clark Bar.

10:57.923 --> 11:00.585
-Clark Bar.
-Keep going.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.794
-I'm up to $2 here.
-Here.

11:02.962 --> 11:07.160
-George, get a <i>Penthouse Forum.</i>
-I'm not getting a <i>Penthouse Forum.</i>

11:07.333 --> 11:09.665
No, that'll make great
dinner-party conversation.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.061
We'll read the letters
at the dinner table.

11:12.238 --> 11:14.706
-Oh, that's nice.
-You ever read one of these?

11:14.874 --> 11:16.774
It's not real. They're all made up.

11:16.942 --> 11:18.671
Oh, it's real.

11:19.145 --> 11:22.171
You know, then there's an unusual
number of people having sex...

11:22.348 --> 11:24.680
...with amputees.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.853
<i>Penthouse Forum.</i>

11:33.025 --> 11:36.017
Newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.

11:40.132 --> 11:41.360
Six seventy-five.

11:41.534 --> 11:45.095
Oh, great. All right, with the wine,
I'm in over $20 now.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.364
-Big coat. Big coat!
-Yes.

11:50.576 --> 11:53.067
I'm sorry. It's a new coat.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.307
It's Gore-Tex.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.378
We better be careful with that thing.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.610
You'll start a war.

12:04.323 --> 12:06.689
See, the key to eating
a black-and-white cookie...

12:06.859 --> 12:09.623
...is you wanna get some black
and some white in each bite.

12:09.795 --> 12:12.787
Nothing mixes better
than vanilla and chocolate.

12:13.265 --> 12:16.894
And yet still somehow,
racial harmony eludes us.

12:17.636 --> 12:19.900
If people would only
look to the cookie...

12:20.072 --> 12:21.733
...all our problems would be solved.

12:22.441 --> 12:25.740
Well, your views on race relations
are just fascinating.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.369
You really should do
an op-ed piece for <i>The Times.</i>

12:29.582 --> 12:31.516
Look to the cookie, Elaine.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.151
Look to the cookie.

12:35.187 --> 12:37.314
What is this?

12:37.490 --> 12:38.957
What?

12:39.125 --> 12:40.422
It's a hair.

12:42.027 --> 12:43.324
Take it back.
Get another one.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.795
-No, we're late. I'll take it off.
-Get another one. It'll take a second.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.593
All right, all right.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.134
-Excuse me.
-Hey, hey.

12:51.303 --> 12:54.500
-I'm on line here.
-No, no, we just bought this.

12:54.673 --> 12:57.198
You sold us a cake with a hair on it.

12:57.376 --> 12:58.775
You have to take a number.

12:59.311 --> 13:01.973
We waited 15 minutes for this.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.512
You sell me a cake with
a hair on it...

13:05.684 --> 13:07.777
...and then you want me to wait?

13:07.987 --> 13:09.852
What are you doing?
You're gonna wait now?

13:10.022 --> 13:12.115
I'm not gonna eat a cake
with a hair on it.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.918
It was a little hair. I took it off.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.288
A little hair?
Do you think that makes it better?

13:16.462 --> 13:19.124
-What if it's your hair?
-What if it's your hair?

13:19.298 --> 13:22.859
What is wrong with my hair? Nobody
takes better care of their hair than me.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.900
You can serve dinner on my head.

13:25.070 --> 13:28.972
You use that misty herbal rainwater
crap they sell in the health food store.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.939
I use Prell, the hard stuff.

13:32.244 --> 13:34.906
Hundred proof, takes your roots out.

13:35.447 --> 13:38.712
Okay, fine. We'll just wait
till she calls the number.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.079
Maybe we should forget
about the cake.

13:41.253 --> 13:43.380
No. I'm bringing cake.

13:46.158 --> 13:50.458
All right, we got the wine.
Aren't we lucky? We got wine.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.624
Imagine if we didn't bring the wine.
We'd be shunned by society.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.928
Outcasts.
"Where's your wine? Get out!"

14:00.005 --> 14:02.701
"I know this is gonna sound
like a crazy fantasy...

14:02.875 --> 14:06.174
...but every word
of this story is true.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.813
A few weeks ago, my girlfriend
mentioned to me...

14:08.981 --> 14:11.677
...how attractive she thought
our new neighbor, Linda, was."

14:11.851 --> 14:13.512
Look... Look at this.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.945
Somebody double-parked
and blocked us in.

14:17.489 --> 14:20.083
Does anybody know
whose car that is?

14:20.926 --> 14:23.986
Maybe there's a note on it.
Oh, brother.

14:24.163 --> 14:25.755
No. No note.

14:25.931 --> 14:28.491
-Can you believe this?
-"Of course, I noticed her too...

14:28.667 --> 14:30.999
...with those ample breasts
and pouty lips.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.195
I don't have to tell you
she was a knockout."

14:37.476 --> 14:40.309
I really cannot comprehend how stupid
people can be sometimes.

14:40.479 --> 14:43.346
-Can you comprehend it?
-No, I can't comprehend it.

14:43.515 --> 14:46.814
We can put a man on the moon,
but we're still basically very stupid.

14:47.119 --> 14:50.111
The guy whose car this is could be
the guy that built the rocket.

14:50.289 --> 14:52.723
-You see what I'm saying?
-He could build the rocket.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.725
He's still stupid for double-parking
and blocking somebody in.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.092
So you understand my point about
building rockets and double-parking?

14:59.265 --> 15:03.031
On one hand, he's smart with rockets.
On the other, he's dumb with parking.

15:03.202 --> 15:04.726
It's cold out here, huh?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.839
Maybe it's not stupidity.
Maybe it's just a blatant disregard...

15:08.007 --> 15:09.634
...for basic human decency.

15:09.808 --> 15:11.708
This is how dictators start.

15:11.877 --> 15:14.607
Think Mussolini would circle
the block six times for a spot?

15:14.780 --> 15:16.179
How about Idi Amin, huh?

15:16.348 --> 15:19.806
If I was running for office, I'd ask for
the death penalty for double-parkers.

15:19.985 --> 15:22.283
If this is allowed to go on,
this is not a society.

15:22.454 --> 15:23.853
This is anarchy!

15:24.023 --> 15:26.321
-Are those shoes comfortable?
-No, not really.

15:26.492 --> 15:30.087
-They look comfortable.
-That's why I got them, but they're not.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.799
Why couldn't we take
the hair off and go?

15:34.967 --> 15:37.458
-No. That's out of the question.
-Why?

15:37.636 --> 15:41.766
Because I had a bad experience
with a hair when I was younger.

15:43.042 --> 15:45.875
-What happened?
-I'd rather not talk about it.

15:46.845 --> 15:49.109
-You can't tell me?
-All right.

15:51.383 --> 15:54.648
I once found a hair in my farina,
and I freaked out.

15:55.387 --> 15:58.015
You found a hair in your farina?

15:58.190 --> 15:59.418
Yeah.

15:59.591 --> 16:00.819
-What happened?
-I screamed:

16:00.993 --> 16:03.655
"There's a hair in my farina.
There's a hair in my farina."

16:03.829 --> 16:06.093
I ran out of the house.
I was running and running.

16:06.265 --> 16:08.130
I was little, but I could run really fast.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.234
And I... I just kept running and...

16:10.402 --> 16:14.168
...they found me three hours later
collapsed at a construction site.

16:16.742 --> 16:19.176
-Whose hair was it?
-My mother's.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.236
-Fifty-eight.
-That's us.

16:21.413 --> 16:22.641
Oh, good.

16:26.352 --> 16:29.480
You sold us a hair
with a cake around it.

16:30.389 --> 16:32.254
We'd like another one.

16:33.959 --> 16:38.521
Oh, that's lovely.
That's what you wanna see, yeah.

16:39.598 --> 16:42.624
Yeah, you wanna trade your hair
for some phlegm.

16:43.869 --> 16:46.838
You win the pennant with that trade.
Hair for phlegm.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.268
Here you are.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.466
Okay. All right,
we got the cake now.

16:51.643 --> 16:53.702
Where is George and Kramer?

16:56.215 --> 16:58.240
Hey, double-parker!

16:59.118 --> 17:00.483
Show yourself!

17:00.652 --> 17:03.382
Come on out, I'm freezing.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.721
We are really late now.

17:05.891 --> 17:08.358
-We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
-Why?

17:08.527 --> 17:10.118
You know, Elaine.

17:10.295 --> 17:12.262
What about her?

17:12.931 --> 17:14.990
I'm a little scared of her.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.592
-You're scared of Elaine?
-Yes.

17:17.770 --> 17:18.998
Why?

17:19.171 --> 17:20.900
Did you ever see her
lose her temper?

17:21.073 --> 17:23.064
I was once late because
I bought a Panama hat.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.439
She pulled it down so hard
my head came right through the top.

17:26.612 --> 17:28.842
Let's go inside the liquor store.
I'm freezing.

17:29.014 --> 17:33.280
-Why don't you wear a heavier coat?
-I wanted to look good for the party.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.551
Hey, hey, hey. That's great.
That's very nice.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.623
We been waiting 20 minutes
for you people.

17:39.792 --> 17:44.820
-You think you're Mussolini?
-Back off, puffball, it's not my car!

17:47.332 --> 17:49.266
I wasn't talking to you.

17:49.435 --> 17:51.096
I'm going in.

17:53.305 --> 17:56.240
Wait till I get my hands
on that George.

17:56.408 --> 18:01.209
I am gonna pull that big hood
over his little head...

18:01.780 --> 18:03.475
...tie the strings...

18:03.649 --> 18:05.913
...and suffocate him.

18:06.785 --> 18:09.049
You remember that Panama hat?

18:09.521 --> 18:11.546
That was nothing.

18:12.391 --> 18:13.415
What?

18:14.026 --> 18:17.325
-What's the matter with you?
-I don't know. I don't feel so good.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.893
What's wrong?

18:19.064 --> 18:20.929
My stomach.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.728
I think it was that cookie.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.528
-The black-and-white?
-Yeah.

18:26.905 --> 18:28.770
Not getting along?

18:31.376 --> 18:34.641
I think I got David Duke
and Farrakhan down there.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.844
If we can't look to the cookie,
where can we look?

18:38.016 --> 18:40.075
My stomach.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.847
-Wait. What about your vomit streak?
-I know.

18:43.021 --> 18:46.388
I haven't thrown up
since June 29, 1980.

18:53.098 --> 18:55.328
-Sorry.
-Sorry?

18:55.501 --> 18:57.366
You almost took my toe off.

18:57.536 --> 19:00.061
Why don't you watch
what you're doing, you lunatic.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.902
Jerry, I think he broke my toe.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.739
Where..? Where you going?

19:08.580 --> 19:11.071
Fourteen years down the drain.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.644
You think chickens have
individual personalities?

19:13.819 --> 19:15.252
I don't know.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.285
Could you tell five chickens apart...

19:17.456 --> 19:21.051
...just by the way they acted?
Or would they all be walking around:

19:22.094 --> 19:25.791
If they have individual personalities,
I'm not sure we should be eating them.

19:26.565 --> 19:28.499
What's the matter with you?

19:28.767 --> 19:30.928
Can I help you guys with anything?

19:31.403 --> 19:33.234
No, no. We bought
the wine here before.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.600
We're blocked in by some car
double-parked.

19:35.774 --> 19:37.366
Just waiting for the
guy to pull out.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.372
Well, wait outside.
This isn't a hang out.

19:40.979 --> 19:44.210
-But my friend here has hypothermia.
-Hypothermia.

19:44.383 --> 19:45.907
All right, guys.

19:46.084 --> 19:48.018
Take it outside.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.451
You're paying for these.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.729
-How was it?
-Good as it gets.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.235
You know, that coat was Gore-Tex.

20:10.409 --> 20:13.139
It's worth a hell of a lot more
than that cheap chardonnay.

20:13.312 --> 20:16.543
You know I'm freezing?
I'm definitely freezing.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.114
I can't stop shaking.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.615
I'm cold too. At least you got a coat.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.651
Let's get in the car.

20:27.593 --> 20:30.255
Oh, my God.
That's Saddam Hussein, the dictator.

20:30.429 --> 20:32.590
I told you. I told you.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.332
I wouldn't walk around
without a coat.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.832
You'll catch your death of cold.
So long.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.329
Can I get you anything else?

20:41.807 --> 20:45.265
-Oh, no, thanks.
-How about a nice box of scram?

20:50.949 --> 20:52.974
Somebody double-parked.
We couldn't help it.

20:53.151 --> 20:55.176
Might've been Saddam Hussein.
We're not sure.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.512
He had a British accent, though.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.351
What..? What happened to you?

21:01.193 --> 21:04.287
Somebody put a cane on my foot...

21:04.930 --> 21:07.262
...just like the one
I'm gonna put up your...

21:07.432 --> 21:09.297
Hey, what happened to your coat?

21:09.468 --> 21:12.437
And what is that smell?
What, are you drunk?

21:12.704 --> 21:15.764
-I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
-What for?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.171
I spilled some chardonnay.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.771
So, what did you get?

21:21.213 --> 21:24.011
-Cinnamon babka.
-Cinnamon?

21:24.182 --> 21:26.412
-Why didn't you get chocolate?
-George.

21:26.585 --> 21:28.348
What? What? What?

21:38.630 --> 21:40.461
Here. Here's your cake.

21:40.632 --> 21:41.894
And your wine.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.160
-See you.
-See you.

21:55.347 --> 21:56.837
I heard a weatherman say...

21:57.015 --> 22:00.041
...that 75 percent of your body heat...

22:00.218 --> 22:02.686
...is actually lost
through the top of the head.

22:02.854 --> 22:06.290
Which sounds like you could go
skiing naked if you got a good hat.

22:09.027 --> 22:12.690
But no hat makes a statement
quite like the hat with the flaps.

22:12.864 --> 22:15.128
The hat with the flaps...

22:15.300 --> 22:19.259
...makes a statement
that no other hat makes.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.838
This hat says to the world:

22:22.007 --> 22:24.237
"I would rather have
the heat in my skull...

22:24.409 --> 22:27.708
...than anything society
could possibly offer me."

22:28.413 --> 22:30.904
In fact, if you're on trial
for a serious crime...

22:31.083 --> 22:33.551
...and your lawyer recommends
the insanity defense...

22:33.719 --> 22:35.880
...this is the hat to wear.

22:36.054 --> 22:38.522
Your lawyer should really insist.
He should just go:

22:38.690 --> 22:42.592
"Your Honor, the defense rests."
