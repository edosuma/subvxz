LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

00:25.160 --> 00:27.120
SEASON VI
EPISODE 12

00:30.020 --> 00:32.220
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

00:33.020 --> 00:35.160
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

00:35.190 --> 00:39.110
A quick recap of the week,
which has been busy in the U.S.,

00:39.130 --> 00:42.170
from the advancement of more
anti-abortion bills

00:42.200 --> 00:45.230
to Treasury Secretary and
thirst-trap Steve Mnuchin

00:46.010 --> 00:48.060
withholding
Trump's tax returns.

00:48.090 --> 00:51.120
It has been very depressing
here in America, so instead,

00:51.140 --> 00:54.200
let's start overseas, with
the Eurovision Song Contest.

00:54.220 --> 00:58.020
Basically, "America's Got Talent",
minus the "America"

00:58.040 --> 00:59.220
and, frequently, the talent.

01:00.020 --> 01:04.160
Last night's finale was the usual
festival of campy pop music,

01:04.180 --> 01:07.160
featuring a Russian serenading
a rainy window,

01:08.040 --> 01:11.140
an Azerbaijani contestant having
robotic heart surgery

01:12.010 --> 01:15.040
and an Australian dressed
as Elsa from Frozen on a stick.

01:15.070 --> 01:19.050
The most striking performance
came from the Icelandic entry,

01:19.080 --> 01:21.010
who went
a very different way.

01:39.090 --> 01:42.210
That's lovely. Finally we have
an answer to the question:

01:42.240 --> 01:46.150
what if you'd sprinkled fairy dust
onto a Criss Angel show?

01:47.080 --> 01:50.220
That was the magnificent Icelandic
band "Hatari".

01:50.240 --> 01:53.070
I'll let them describe
what they're about.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.150
We are Icelandic
award-winning anticapitalist

01:56.170 --> 01:59.210
techno performance BDSM
band Hatari.

02:00.210 --> 02:03.000
I'm so glad you cleared
that up, guys.

02:03.020 --> 02:06.030
I'd assumed that you were
a Norwegian award-nominated

02:06.050 --> 02:09.009
proto-fascist industrial BBW
MILF DP band,

02:09.030 --> 02:11.230
but apparently I was
sorely mistaken on that.

02:12.140 --> 02:16.170
Hatari got attention by ignoring
Eurovision's history to be apolitical.

02:16.190 --> 02:19.190
The lead singer described
qualifying for the contest

02:19.210 --> 02:23.190
as bringing them "one step nearer,
to our plan to destroy capitalism."

02:23.210 --> 02:27.040
If you think: "What qualifies
them to discuss geopolitics?"

02:27.060 --> 02:28.240
It's actually in their blood.

02:29.050 --> 02:32.000
This young man here,
apparently is the son

02:32.020 --> 02:34.090
of the Icelandic ambassador
to the U.K.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.110
Do you have anything to say?

02:39.210 --> 02:42.130
You may think
that's the most embarrassing child

02:42.160 --> 02:45.140
of a prominent political figure,
but let me remind you

02:45.160 --> 02:48.010
the continued existence
of Meghan McCain.

02:48.070 --> 02:52.200
No! I bet her husband's
gonna get so mad at me now!

02:53.020 --> 02:56.180
What is he gonna tweet and delete?
I can't wait to find out!

02:57.150 --> 03:00.170
I would love to spend
all night talking about Hatari,

03:00.700 --> 03:01.920
but we have
to move on to China,

03:02.690 --> 03:05.880
home of the world's most famous
big expensive wall that didn't work,

03:05.920 --> 03:07.740
for now.

03:08.740 --> 03:12.700
Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion
worth of Chinese goods,

03:12.720 --> 03:15.910
marking another escalation in
a seemingly intractable trade war.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.700
U.S. farmers and manufacturers
are starting to suffer,

03:19.730 --> 03:21.720
Trump insists everything's fine.

03:21.810 --> 03:26.710
Our farmers will be very happy,
our manufacturers will be happy

03:26.750 --> 03:28.730
and our government
is very happy

03:28.760 --> 03:31.790
because we're taking in tens
of billions of dollars.

03:31.810 --> 03:33.710
It's working out very well.

03:33.810 --> 03:37.870
It is alarming whenever Trump
claims something's going well.

03:37.920 --> 03:42.770
If you ever hear him say: "We love
this building! So little fire!"

03:42.810 --> 03:46.780
get the fuck out of there,
it is about to burn to the ground.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.840
Trump's line there about
"tens of billions of dollars" reflects

03:51.860 --> 03:55.900
his longstanding belief that
China is paying tariffs to the U.S.A.

03:55.920 --> 03:59.900
Which, for the millionth time,
is not how tariffs work.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.680
China doesn't pay our tariffs,

04:02.700 --> 04:05.720
American importers do
when they receive Chinese goods

04:05.740 --> 04:08.770
and they usually pass that
cost along to U.S. consumers.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.840
Something that chief economic
adviser, Larry Kudlow,

04:11.870 --> 04:14.740
reluctantly admitted
to when pressed on it.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.779
It's U.S. businesses and
consumers who pay, correct?

04:18.800 --> 04:21.720
Yes, to some extent,
I don't disagree with that.

04:21.910 --> 04:25.730
"I don't disagree with that?"
That's a pretty laid-back way

04:25.750 --> 04:28.710
to admit that Trump's entire
argument is bullshit.

04:28.780 --> 04:29.910
Saying China pays tariffs

04:30.680 --> 04:33.760
is like saying the cashier at
Subway pays for your sandwich.

04:33.780 --> 04:36.760
No, you pay for it! And
you actually pay three times:

04:36.780 --> 04:39.780
once at the counter, again
when you're sadly eating it

04:39.800 --> 04:41.850
and finally,
two and a half hours later.

04:42.770 --> 04:43.830
You pay three times.

04:44.810 --> 04:48.720
It's an open question whether
Trump knows this, and doesn't care

04:48.750 --> 04:51.830
or whether Trump doesn't know
this, and it's the second one.

04:51.850 --> 04:53.900
When one reporter asked officials

04:53.920 --> 04:57.720
whether Trump truly thinks
that China pays U.S. tariffs,

04:57.740 --> 05:00.890
the consensus was: "yes,
that's what he actually believes."

05:01.600 --> 05:04.730
Which is pathetic, because
these tariffs and this trade war,

05:04.750 --> 05:06.740
are now
having real consequences.

05:06.760 --> 05:10.580
While Trump said that
"our farmers will be very happy",

05:10.630 --> 05:14.620
when reporters went to talk to
some, they found a different story.

05:15.530 --> 05:18.530
What is the situation
for you and your operation?

05:18.650 --> 05:19.760
Two words. It sucks.

05:20.660 --> 05:24.590
Yeah, and "it sucks"
is not usually what you say

05:24.610 --> 05:28.740
when you're very happy, unless
is 1901, you are Hubert Cecil Booth

05:29.520 --> 05:32.640
and you just invented the world's
first power vacuum cleaner.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.540
"I'm so happy!
It sucks so much!"

05:35.600 --> 05:39.620
"I'm gonna be rich! By George,
it sucks! It sucks so hard."

05:40.560 --> 05:45.680
The worrying thing is that
clearly nothing's going to change.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.600
Trump is 72 years old,
if he hasn't shown any interest

05:49.620 --> 05:53.690
in learning how trade works,
he's not about to start learning now,

05:53.740 --> 05:58.640
leaving us in the ridiculous position
where the current president of the US

05:58.670 --> 06:02.540
may have a less-informed
take on global economics

06:02.620 --> 06:05.680
than a leather-wrapped Icelandic
dystopian techno band.

06:05.820 --> 06:07.620
And now, this.

06:08.610 --> 06:11.770
A Few More
Moments of Hatari.

06:12.810 --> 06:16.780
It's not easy to work
towards ending capitalism.

06:16.810 --> 06:20.710
The appetite of fascism
is a hopeless cry

06:20.760 --> 06:22.820
for the remnants
of the nation-state,

06:23.750 --> 06:25.750
which is, of course,
doomed to fail.

06:26.760 --> 06:31.610
If you're full of warm and joyful
feelings, of color and spritely energy.

06:31.690 --> 06:34.840
My celebrity crush this year
is Theresa May.

06:35.650 --> 06:38.810
Please contact me
at capitalism@Hatari.is.

06:39.630 --> 06:41.800
We address our statement
to Benjamin Netanyahu.

06:41.820 --> 06:45.600
We, members of Hatari,
hereby challenge you

06:45.620 --> 06:49.750
to a friendly match of traditional
Icelandic trouser grip-wrestling.

06:49.820 --> 06:52.630
In a contest such as
the Eurovision,

06:52.650 --> 06:54.840
it's important to invest
in a younger generation.

06:55.610 --> 06:58.820
It's also true when you're
toppling a socio-economic world order.

06:58.840 --> 07:03.770
All the children that support us,
they see our cause and our message.

07:04.300 --> 07:07.470
We love children and smiling and
dancing among friends and family.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.520
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns death:

07:15.320 --> 07:17.430
one of the few things
in life you can't avoid,

07:17.450 --> 07:21.420
along with taxes and plugging in
a flash drive upside down on first try.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.410
Statistically, it can't be done.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.500
This story is about the people
who investigate deaths.

07:27.520 --> 07:30.460
If you're thinking:
"I don't want to see that on TV",

07:30.480 --> 07:32.370
are you completely sure?

07:32.480 --> 07:36.420
Death investigators aren't just
characters on some popular shows,

07:36.440 --> 07:40.340
like "Law &amp; Order: SVU",
"CSI" and "NCIS",

07:40.370 --> 07:43.360
every once in a while, they
even get a show of their own.

07:43.380 --> 07:47.360
Think you can get away with
murder? Over her dead bodies.

07:47.420 --> 07:49.350
ABC's "Body of Proof".

07:49.400 --> 07:53.420
Smart is better when it's partnered
with sexy, "Rizzoli &amp; Isles."

07:53.440 --> 07:56.290
I'm New York City's
top medical examiner.

07:56.320 --> 08:00.340
It's like I've been doing this
forever. Well, actually, I have.

08:00.390 --> 08:01.410
"Forever."

08:01.510 --> 08:05.420
Yes, "Forever". Which is also
precisely the wrong answer

08:05.860 --> 08:08.890
to the question: "how long
was that show on television?"

08:09.050 --> 08:12.870
But it is not just TV death
investigators who are very busy.

08:12.890 --> 08:16.070
In real life, every year, about
2.8 million Americans die.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.060
A physician is the one who writes

08:18.080 --> 08:21.010
what happened to them
on the death certificate.

08:21.030 --> 08:24.040
If someone dies under
unnatural circumstances,

08:24.060 --> 08:26.940
their body may be sent
for further examination

08:26.960 --> 08:28.940
and possibly
a forensic autopsy.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.059
That's what happens to around
half a million bodies each year.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.059
Those investigations
are incredibly important.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.030
A death certificate
isn't like a degree from USC,

08:38.049 --> 08:39.980
it actually means something.

08:40.929 --> 08:44.039
Autopsy results
have huge implications,

08:44.059 --> 08:47.860
there's the obvious one like
determining whether someone

08:47.880 --> 08:49.070
has been killed
and if so, how.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.030
They help identify new
trends in substance abuse,

08:52.070 --> 08:55.910
warn us about defective products
and they can sound the alarm

08:55.930 --> 08:58.890
when they spot the spread
of an infectious disease.

08:58.910 --> 09:01.970
People in this field
take that responsibility seriously.

09:02.850 --> 09:05.940
We're on the front line
of what people are dying of.

09:06.260 --> 09:09.450
We see it every day and we
notice a trend pretty quickly,

09:09.470 --> 09:13.280
so we like to get the information
out as soon as possible

09:13.310 --> 09:17.410
so that others are aware, maybe
prevent a few deaths if we can.

09:18.330 --> 09:22.290
An important point about the
public-health role of her office,

09:22.310 --> 09:26.370
only undercut by the skeleton
of Santa Claus behind her,

09:26.390 --> 09:30.250
who it seems for some reason
died with his dick in a box.

09:31.250 --> 09:35.480
While it would be great if those
autopsies were always performed

09:36.250 --> 09:39.330
and overseen responsibly, as
local news regularly shows us,

09:39.350 --> 09:41.310
that is by no means the case.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.420
Tucked away in a storage
unit in Pensacola,

09:44.450 --> 09:48.260
authorities found more
than a hundred human organs.

09:48.280 --> 09:51.460
The renter of the unit, former
medical examiner Michael Berkland.

09:51.480 --> 09:55.310
The family of an elderly murder
victim is not happy.

09:55.330 --> 09:58.380
They found out that two,
now former, GBI employees

09:58.400 --> 10:02.360
took a picture holding the dismembered
head of their loved one.

10:02.380 --> 10:07.260
We can't show you that
picture because it is too graphic.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.380
Shelly took the Marine's brain
home with him to Virginia,

10:10.400 --> 10:14.530
and letting his kids play with it
while his wife took pictures.

10:15.450 --> 10:19.380
That's an appalling story for
a number of reasons, but most of all:

10:19.400 --> 10:21.500
why did his wife
take pictures?

10:22.400 --> 10:25.450
What was she going to do with
them? Post them on Facebook?

10:25.470 --> 10:27.350
With what caption?

10:27.420 --> 10:29.520
Jackson and baby Timothy
handling a brain.

10:29.540 --> 10:33.380
Daddy is always bringing home
a new organ for them to molest.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.550
Hashtag #growingboys,
hashtag #godisgood".

10:36.510 --> 10:40.410
While those are just individual
examples of what can go wrong,

10:40.430 --> 10:43.350
the problems are broader,
with reports finding

10:43.370 --> 10:46.410
"many death-investigation
facilities are antiquated"

10:46.430 --> 10:48.480
"and in need of repair
or replacement."

10:48.500 --> 10:51.350
Given how important
those facilities are,

10:51.370 --> 10:54.450
it is shocking how often
they're funded as an afterthought.

10:55.350 --> 10:58.320
The U.S. government provides
virtually no funding

10:58.340 --> 11:01.330
to either medical examiners
or coroners.

11:01.470 --> 11:06.420
One of their grants was for
one office to get a new refrigerator

11:06.440 --> 11:10.380
because their current refrigerator
was closed by a belt.

11:11.630 --> 11:15.710
That's how poorly funded.
I, myself, have worked in an office

11:15.730 --> 11:20.710
where it was a converted garage
with a single light

11:20.730 --> 11:23.780
dangling from the roof,

11:25.570 --> 11:28.770
a single light bulb
over my autopsy table.

11:29.700 --> 11:32.660
That is, quite frankly,
too spooky.

11:32.740 --> 11:35.660
If I've learned anything
from horror movies,

11:35.680 --> 11:37.760
when you see a room
with one dead person,

11:37.780 --> 11:39.800
one alive person
and one light bulb,

11:40.570 --> 11:42.600
that's a room
that's about to contain

11:42.620 --> 11:44.610
two dead people
and one light bulb.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.610
Learn from movies.
So tonight,

11:48.680 --> 11:51.620
let's talk about
our death investigation system.

11:51.660 --> 11:54.770
How it works, why it's such a
mess, and what we can do about it.

11:55.570 --> 11:58.780
You should know that, depending
on where you live, or indeed, die,

11:59.560 --> 12:01.760
you could wind up funneled
into one of two systems.

12:01.780 --> 12:05.590
Two-thirds of the country's
death investigation offices

12:05.610 --> 12:09.570
are overseen by coroners, while
medical examiners oversee the rest.

12:09.590 --> 12:11.700
You might think that those
are the same thing

12:12.140 --> 12:13.300
and they do have
the same job.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.330
They decide whether to have
someone conduct an autopsy

12:16.350 --> 12:19.240
and then using it to rule on
the cause of death.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.320
There is a key difference
between them,

12:21.340 --> 12:24.270
when it comes
to qualifications, in particular.

12:24.300 --> 12:27.200
Medical examiners are required
to be doctors,

12:27.240 --> 12:30.260
coroners are usually
not medically trained at all.

12:30.350 --> 12:35.160
In Georgia, out of 154 coroners
only one is a physician,

12:35.190 --> 12:38.290
while the others include
grocers, farmers, handymen

12:38.310 --> 12:41.330
and hairdressers,
which is a little bit weird.

12:42.150 --> 12:45.200
No disrespect to hairdressers,
but some have been known

12:45.230 --> 12:47.220
to drop the ball
from time to time.

12:48.150 --> 12:52.130
It has happened,
mistakes have been made.

12:53.140 --> 12:57.350
If you are wondering how grocers
and hairdressers became coroners,

12:58.120 --> 13:02.130
In Georgia, as in much of the country,
coroners are elected.

13:02.170 --> 13:04.340
And the bar to run
for the job can be very low.

13:05.140 --> 13:07.330
In Arkansas,
there is barely a bar at all.

13:08.210 --> 13:11.230
You can run and be elected
with zero medical knowledge,

13:11.250 --> 13:15.180
anatomical training
or official certification.

13:15.410 --> 13:20.550
You have to be 18 years or older.
Cannot be a felon. You're electable.

13:21.490 --> 13:25.580
Holy shit. Look to your right.
Now look to your left.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.510
Both these people
are eligible to be,

13:28.540 --> 13:31.440
and indeed are,
coroners in Arkansas.

13:32.540 --> 13:35.500
Having elected officials
with no medical training

13:35.530 --> 13:38.500
signing off on death certificates,
is weird enough,

13:38.520 --> 13:42.500
before you factor in the potential
for huge conflicts of interest.

13:42.560 --> 13:46.420
In some jurisdictions, the coroner
is also the county sheriff

13:46.440 --> 13:48.500
and that has led
to serious problems.

13:48.570 --> 13:53.580
In California, one doctor quit,
claiming the coroner-slash-sheriff

13:53.600 --> 13:57.590
had interfered in cases where
police had used deadly force.

13:58.510 --> 14:01.600
Dr. Bennet Omalu, renowned
for his expertise on concussions

14:02.370 --> 14:05.480
accused San Joaquin County
sheriff and coroner Steve Moore

14:05.500 --> 14:10.360
of trying to change autopsy findings
in shootings involving his officers.

14:10.530 --> 14:14.540
That is not good. It is hard
to trust a death certificate

14:14.560 --> 14:16.600
in a death involving
police officers,

14:17.340 --> 14:21.390
when the guy signing it have an active
interest in police not being culpable.

14:21.420 --> 14:23.320
Also when the guy signing it

14:23.340 --> 14:26.340
looks like Marlon Bundo made
a wish to become a real boy

14:26.360 --> 14:27.560
and it backfired horribly.

14:29.340 --> 14:31.530
That sheriff denied
doing anything improper,

14:31.550 --> 14:35.450
but they've taken coroner
duties away from the sheriff's office.

14:35.470 --> 14:39.360
Which is good, because you can't
have any suggestion of coziness

14:39.380 --> 14:42.340
between death investigators
and law enforcement.

14:42.360 --> 14:45.450
In New Orleans, their coroner
for decades was Frank Minyard,

14:45.470 --> 14:49.430
who was criticized for finding that
people who died in police custody

14:49.450 --> 14:50.560
had suffered accidents,

14:51.330 --> 14:54.510
and when he was confronted over
one case, he got pretty annoyed.

14:55.420 --> 14:58.510
When the body of Henry Glover
was found in this burnedout car,

14:58.560 --> 15:02.540
evidence pointed to police officers
being responsible for his death.

15:03.480 --> 15:07.340
But Coroner Minyard did not
classify it as a homicide

15:07.510 --> 15:10.390
and so there was
no criminal investigation.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.340
A burned-up body
inside a burned-out car?

15:16.450 --> 15:19.560
- Behind a police station?
- Okay, look at it that way.

15:20.410 --> 15:22.420
Now, look at it from
my point of view.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.320
We can't say.

15:25.500 --> 15:29.440
There's no way I can say
that that is a homicide.

15:29.500 --> 15:33.520
There's no way of telling
how, why this man died.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.520
Except, there is a way
to tell how that man died:

15:39.310 --> 15:41.430
a medical investigation
into his death,

15:41.490 --> 15:44.300
which happens to be
your exact job.

15:44.420 --> 15:47.370
Like hearing a clown say:
"There is no way to twist"

15:47.390 --> 15:49.450
"this balloon into
a shape of a dog or hat."

15:49.480 --> 15:53.410
Really, clown? If that's true,
what exactly is the use of you,

15:53.430 --> 15:57.280
other than psychologically damaging
children for life?

15:57.450 --> 16:02.490
That case was later re-classified
as a homicide, because it was.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.390
It is no wonder

16:04.410 --> 16:08.380
that medical organizations have
been calling for the coroner system

16:08.400 --> 16:10.520
to be abolished since 1857,

16:11.380 --> 16:15.280
arguing that the person appointed
should be a doctor in medicine,

16:15.300 --> 16:17.420
essentially,
the medical examiner system.

16:17.460 --> 16:22.500
Instinctively does sound better!
Even this system is not perfect.

16:23.180 --> 16:26.230
The place where staff
posed for photos with a severed head?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.280
That was
a medical examiner's office.

16:28.300 --> 16:31.250
The guy who took the brain
for his kids to play with?

16:31.270 --> 16:33.310
He was and still is
a medical examiner.

16:33.350 --> 16:36.320
And that's not even
mentioning the medical examiner

16:36.340 --> 16:40.260
at the center of the most fantastic
"20/20" interview of all time.

16:41.210 --> 16:45.350
The other charge is that your dog
ate one of the body's spleen

16:47.200 --> 16:49.290
and then he also
ate a kidney, is that true?

16:52.190 --> 16:54.360
Dr. Harlan?
You don't want to respond?

16:55.220 --> 16:57.350
You can deny this if it's not true.

16:59.200 --> 17:04.190
It's never happened to me
in an "ABC News" interview,

17:04.240 --> 17:08.170
but Charles Harlan
fell completely silent.

17:08.230 --> 17:12.270
He didn't get up and leave.
He just simply stopped talking.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.380
What are you doing?
You're still on camera!

17:17.160 --> 17:19.300
I know he's not used
to dealing with the living,

17:19.319 --> 17:22.230
but playing dead
is not a legitimate move here.

17:23.210 --> 17:27.339
Good medical examiners
can be hard to find,

17:27.359 --> 17:29.400
it's not a job
many doctors want.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.350
You've seen the problems of
underinvestment in the facilities,

17:33.370 --> 17:37.260
state-funded medical examiners
make around half the salary

17:37.290 --> 17:39.370
they could
in other medical specialties,

17:39.390 --> 17:43.170
with little potential for tips
from satisfied clients.

17:43.310 --> 17:47.270
That is just if you're happy
with any doctor in the job.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.160
The best-case scenario

17:49.180 --> 17:54.260
is to have board-certified forensic
pathologists running these offices.

17:54.280 --> 17:57.170
But that is not going
to happen anytime soon,

17:57.200 --> 17:59.230
there is a dire
shortage of those.

17:59.260 --> 18:03.390
There are only 500 of them
practicing in the whole US,

18:04.160 --> 18:06.320
which is less than half
the recommended number.

18:06.350 --> 18:10.290
When you combine this shortage
with the current opioid crisis

18:10.310 --> 18:13.270
causing an increase in bodies
that need examining,

18:13.290 --> 18:16.280
you get a system pushed
well past its breaking point.

18:16.330 --> 18:20.250
In New Jersey a few years back,
their acting state medical examiner

18:20.280 --> 18:24.250
resigned in frustration, citing staff
shortages as one of the reasons.

18:24.610 --> 18:27.720
I felt as I walked in the door
they didn't have enough personnel

18:27.750 --> 18:30.590
to handle the load.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.670
You don't want to come
to a family and say:

18:32.690 --> 18:35.550
"I'm sorry ma'am.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Smith."

18:35.580 --> 18:39.610
"We couldn't do the investigation
'cause we don't have the resources."

18:39.670 --> 18:42.750
Right. He wanted to serve people
well. But he couldn't.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.590
Things have not got much better
in New Jersey since.

18:46.620 --> 18:51.690
If you find yourself dying there, write
whatever is killing you on a Post-It

18:51.720 --> 18:53.600
and stick it to your chest.

18:53.630 --> 18:57.580
You'd be doing their overstretched
investigators a solid. Thanks.

18:58.530 --> 19:02.520
The resources crunch is so bad
that some offices wind up

19:02.540 --> 19:04.650
outsourcing work
to private contractors.

19:04.680 --> 19:08.640
This is where this story
gets incredible.

19:08.680 --> 19:12.630
Let me introduce you to one
terrible example of this.

19:12.680 --> 19:16.620
In Missouri and Kansas, a number
of coroners offices wound up hiring

19:16.640 --> 19:20.630
a company belonging to this man,
Shawn Parcells, to perform autopsies.

19:20.650 --> 19:21.690
Why wouldn't they?

19:21.710 --> 19:24.740
He's a guy whose actual license
plate says "Autopsy".

19:25.480 --> 19:28.530
That's reassuring, isn't it?
They don't just hand that out

19:28.550 --> 19:31.630
to anyone with a valid,
government-issued photo ID and $45.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.440
No!

19:33.560 --> 19:37.470
Unfortunately, though, there
were a few problems with Parcells.

19:37.490 --> 19:41.510
He's not a forensic pathologist.
He's not any kind of doctor at all.

19:41.550 --> 19:44.500
While he maintains
that his firm employs doctors,

19:44.520 --> 19:47.610
he's been accused of performing
illegal autopsies himself.

19:47.630 --> 19:50.530
He has left a long trail
of problems behind him.

19:51.410 --> 19:54.530
Parcells has been accused of
botching a murder investigation.

19:54.570 --> 19:59.420
We cannot use any evidence found
from the autopsy in a court of law.

19:59.470 --> 20:02.580
And lying about his credentials.
Did you think he was a doctor?

20:02.610 --> 20:04.430
- Yes.
- Why?

20:04.590 --> 20:06.410
Because he said so.

20:06.440 --> 20:09.530
I tell people all the time:
"I almost became a neurosurgeon."

20:09.550 --> 20:14.620
Doesn't mean that I'm a doctor,
that I was in medical school.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.480
I really did almost do that.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.470
Wait.

20:23.450 --> 20:26.410
You almost became
a neurosurgeon but didn't,

20:26.490 --> 20:29.550
which puts you in a special
category of literally everyone

20:29.580 --> 20:31.640
except fucking neurosurgeons.

20:32.550 --> 20:36.450
I can also claim I almost
became a neurosurgeon

20:36.480 --> 20:39.560
which is why my parents
are almost proud of me.

20:40.640 --> 20:44.650
If you are wondering why
a county coroner office

20:44.670 --> 20:48.680
would hire Shawn's company,
many of them are strapped for cash

20:49.450 --> 20:52.510
and one of them explained:
"It was the most affordable."

20:52.570 --> 20:55.560
Shawn's low rates become
understandable when you see

20:55.580 --> 20:57.520
one of his autopsy facilities,

20:57.540 --> 21:00.470
which he was comfortable
letting cameras in.

21:00.650 --> 21:05.520
Parcells gave us a tour. He's proud
of this back-alley autopsy lab.

21:05.620 --> 21:12.620
So this is the autopsy suite.
And obviously bathroom.

21:13.510 --> 21:17.470
There's carpet on the floor, what
appears to be a lack of organization

21:17.490 --> 21:20.480
and this is how containers
are labeled and stored.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.480
I don't know where...
She's over there, so just...

21:23.610 --> 21:25.680
We agreed to not record
a woman's body

21:26.460 --> 21:29.540
that was unwrapped
and unrefrigerated in the corner.

21:29.610 --> 21:30.640
The freezers.

21:30.660 --> 21:34.500
And it couldn't be, because
there's no walk-in refrigerator

21:34.520 --> 21:36.460
inside this makeshift morgue.

21:36.480 --> 21:40.530
Only two small freezers that could
be purchased at any big box store.

21:41.450 --> 21:46.500
What jumps out at me the most
about Shawn's tricked out death-hutch

21:46.520 --> 21:48.650
isn't the single Glade PlugIn

21:49.460 --> 21:52.520
or the name "Shawn"
surrounded by green hearts

21:52.540 --> 21:56.460
or the Tupperware containers of
baked ziti and-or human remains

21:56.490 --> 22:01.540
or the presence of a spray bottle
of Scrubbing Bubbles Bathroom Cleaner

22:01.580 --> 22:06.550
or the sick "Lab Of Nerds" poster
or the sicker Albert Einstein poster

22:06.570 --> 22:09.670
opposite the room-temperature
cadaver or the desktop skull

22:10.450 --> 22:14.530
or the unfolded beach towel
or even the wall-to-wall carpeting.

22:14.620 --> 22:19.460
No. Even within a grifter's
back-alley autopsy shanty,

22:19.480 --> 22:21.600
the most objectionable item
on display there

22:21.630 --> 22:24.530
is somehow
that enormous soda.

22:24.630 --> 22:27.650
What are you doing with that
thing, you fucking monster?

22:29.370 --> 22:33.460
This repurposed ramen container
could and I have to assume does

22:33.480 --> 22:36.320
contain blood, phlegm and
embalming fluid

22:36.340 --> 22:40.280
and yet it still would still be less
nauseating than the possibility

22:40.300 --> 22:41.480
he's drinking a 40 of Squirt.

22:42.520 --> 22:46.490
That's me speaking personally,
as well as correctly and objectively.

22:46.510 --> 22:50.400
There is even more here.
Parcells has also gotten in trouble

22:50.430 --> 22:54.400
for autopsies he's performed
through his private businesses,

22:54.420 --> 22:57.440
for which he often failed
to produce any sort of report.

22:57.470 --> 23:01.280
All of which has led to him
facing pending criminal charges

23:01.300 --> 23:03.400
of theft
and desecration of bodies.

23:03.440 --> 23:08.290
All of this has clearly given him
a bad name in the business.

23:08.360 --> 23:10.520
Rather than stopping
what he was doing,

23:11.300 --> 23:14.400
Shawn Parcells
stopped being "Shawn Parcells"

23:14.440 --> 23:18.320
and instead, started working under
the name "Professor Lynn".

23:18.340 --> 23:22.340
When that reporter asked him why,
his answer wasn't great.

23:22.520 --> 23:29.290
Lynn was used as a nickname.
Honestly, I'm being honest here,

23:29.350 --> 23:32.520
because people would
butcher my last name.

23:33.340 --> 23:36.460
- "Parcells" isn't that difficult.
- It's not. It really isn't.

23:36.480 --> 23:42.370
I've had people say
"Percellies", "Parcellies"...

23:42.390 --> 23:45.510
When you're emailing, you don't
have to pronounce it out loud.

23:45.530 --> 23:49.330
Why are you signing things
"Professor Lynn"?

23:49.540 --> 23:52.470
It's my middle name.
I have that right.

23:53.390 --> 23:58.320
First: that's clearly horseshit.
And second, the only person

23:58.340 --> 24:00.550
who should be going by his
middle name is Hugh Grant,

24:01.320 --> 24:03.470
whose middle name, and
this is true, is Mungo.

24:04.340 --> 24:08.420
His actual name
is Hugh Mungo Grant

24:08.470 --> 24:11.460
and for some reason
he chooses not to publicize that.

24:11.500 --> 24:15.490
Like an idiot. You're looking
a gift horse in the mouth, Mungo.

24:17.370 --> 24:22.530
As funny as Parcells is, and he is
distractingly, inconveniently funny,

24:23.340 --> 24:27.360
he's botched multiple
death investigations.

24:27.420 --> 24:30.320
The only reason he had
the opportunity to do so

24:30.340 --> 24:34.360
was because of the Big-Gulp-sized
holes in death-investigation system.

24:34.420 --> 24:39.380
It is not just dramatic consequences
of investigations being compromised

24:39.400 --> 24:41.480
or epidemics
potentially being missed.

24:41.500 --> 24:44.560
Even ordinary delays in processing
death certificates

24:45.340 --> 24:48.360
can have serious practical
consequences for families.

24:48.380 --> 24:51.350
You'd want a death certificate
within days or weeks.

24:51.370 --> 24:53.520
But it can take
much longer than that.

24:53.560 --> 24:57.380
Listen to one woman whose
husband had passed away suddenly,

24:57.400 --> 24:59.480
and waited
six months for a cause of death.

24:59.530 --> 25:04.320
They're not thinking of these
families that are waiting in agony,

25:04.350 --> 25:07.500
to know what happened,
it's inexcusable.

25:07.540 --> 25:10.530
The holdup
left Sara struggling financially.

25:10.560 --> 25:16.390
Without the death certificate,
she couldn't collect life insurance.

25:16.460 --> 25:21.560
I couldn't pay for the mortgage.
I had to rely on donations.

25:22.350 --> 25:24.510
To you, it's much more
than just a piece of paper.

25:24.540 --> 25:27.560
Yes, it meant moving on.

25:28.500 --> 25:33.430
Awful. You shouldn't have to wait
that long for something important.

25:33.780 --> 25:36.810
It's not like making someone
wait eight years to find out

25:36.830 --> 25:38.000
who wins
the game of thrones.

25:38.770 --> 25:40.880
Don't tell me who it is yet,
I haven't seen it.

25:40.900 --> 25:43.940
Based on the season so far,
I'm guessing it was Ed Sheeran.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.800
They really know how to deliver
for the fans. Don't they?

25:48.870 --> 25:50.850
What should happen now?

25:50.900 --> 25:52.970
In an ideal world,
no one would die.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.910
I'm certainly never going to and
I don't think you should either.

25:56.970 --> 26:01.800
In a slightly less ideal world, we
would phase out coroner's offices

26:01.830 --> 26:03.910
and replace them
with medical examiners,

26:03.930 --> 26:07.800
the thing that experts have
been arguing for since the 1800's.

26:07.820 --> 26:11.910
We have autopsies performed by
board-certified forensic pathologists.

26:11.930 --> 26:15.830
Not going to happen until we
address the huge personnel shortage.

26:15.860 --> 26:18.890
You can't hire forensic
pathologists who don't exist.

26:18.950 --> 26:22.900
We need to find ways to incentivize
med-school students,

26:22.920 --> 26:28.800
paying them more and by funding
the offices they'll be working in.

26:28.830 --> 26:31.850
It wouldn't even
cost that much.

26:31.950 --> 26:35.860
One study recommended bringing
public spending on these offices

26:36.180 --> 26:40.270
up to a minimum of just
$3.75 per person per year.

26:40.330 --> 26:44.260
Less than the amount of money
that we annually donate

26:44.280 --> 26:46.220
to our couch cushions.

26:47.180 --> 26:51.200
This issue is tempting to ignore.
It combines the two things

26:51.220 --> 26:53.320
that people hate thinking
about the most:

26:53.340 --> 26:55.270
death and municipal funding.

26:55.320 --> 27:00.210
Nobody wants to contemplate
their death or the death of loved ones.

27:00.230 --> 27:02.290
Think about this
in a more abstract way.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.360
Think about what you would
want for a beloved entertainer.

27:05.380 --> 27:08.380
Not me, obviously,
that's the worst possible example.

27:08.400 --> 27:13.170
Think of Beyoncé, or Ted Danson,
or Glenn Close.

27:13.210 --> 27:17.230
Do you want Glenn Close to wind
up in Parcells' autopsy dungeon

27:17.290 --> 27:20.220
or having her spleen being
eaten by a dog?

27:20.250 --> 27:23.160
Of course not!
She's a seven-time Oscar nominee

27:23.180 --> 27:26.240
and she doesn't want that to
happen either, do you, Glenn?

27:26.320 --> 27:29.370
No, I don't want
my spleen eaten by a dog.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.400
Show my spleen
some respect.

27:33.260 --> 27:36.280
That's right, Glenn!
Put some respect on her spleen!

27:37.680 --> 27:39.730
Put some respect
on that woman's spleen.

27:39.780 --> 27:44.660
Glenn Close deserves three things:
two Oscars

27:44.700 --> 27:46.760
and not to have
her spleen eaten by a dog.

27:46.810 --> 27:48.870
That's the least
America can do for her.

27:49.650 --> 27:52.740
We can and should improve our
death-investigation system,

27:52.760 --> 27:55.760
for Glenn Close
and for every other person.

27:55.780 --> 27:58.710
Not just because it's important,
which it is.

27:58.750 --> 28:01.720
Not just because it could save
lives, which it could.

28:01.750 --> 28:04.720
Because all it will cost us
is roughly the same price

28:04.740 --> 28:06.760
as an extra-large Big Gulp.

28:08.650 --> 28:09.790
And now this.

28:10.780 --> 28:14.840
A Message About The Importance
Of Death Investigations

28:14.870 --> 28:16.750
From Tracy Morgan.

28:17.830 --> 28:21.680
This is Tracy Morgan. Can I talk about
something for a minute?

28:21.760 --> 28:25.780
We all know that one day
we all won't be on this planet.

28:25.850 --> 28:28.730
We're gonna die. I don't
know how I'm gonna die

28:28.750 --> 28:30.800
but I know it's not gonna be
by a Walmart.

28:30.820 --> 28:33.660
When my time does come,
I don't want to end up

28:33.680 --> 28:36.640
in a basement dungeon
on some dude's autopsy table,

28:36.660 --> 28:39.820
standing over me with a knife,
a dull spoon, an ice cream scooper.

28:40.640 --> 28:41.780
I don't want these things.

28:41.800 --> 28:45.880
Please don't let someone take
my brain home to play with.

28:46.870 --> 28:49.870
That's not a good thing.
And I love this woman.

28:50.640 --> 28:55.680
I cannot have some dog out here
eating Glenn Close's spleen.

28:55.730 --> 28:59.700
Glenn Close is an American treasure.
I love you in "Albert Nobbs".

28:59.860 --> 29:01.750
That's why we need you here.

29:01.770 --> 29:06.720
All it's gonna take is $3.75
to save Glenn Close's spleen.

29:07.820 --> 29:12.840
Right? Don't you want to save her
spleen? $3.75. Who don't got that?

29:13.750 --> 29:16.670
$3.75. It's all it takes.

29:17.820 --> 29:20.710
Y'all can pack this shit up
and get out my house.

29:21.850 --> 29:23.640
That's our show!

29:23.660 --> 29:26.780
We're off next week, back on
June 2nd! See you then! Good night!

29:27.780 --> 29:30.730
