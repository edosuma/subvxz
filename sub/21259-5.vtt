[Candace cackling]

00:04.872 --> 00:07.308
Voiceover: Previously,
on Odd Mom Out.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.809
- How long has she
been living with you?

00:08.842 --> 00:11.579
- 525,600 migraines.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.114
- You need to get her
on jury duty.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.282
- Now you're talking.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.284
- There's a 24 hour hotline
you can call to volunteer.

00:16.317 --> 00:16.950
[imitating Candace's voice]

00:16.984 --> 00:18.452
- This is Candace von Weber.

00:18.486 --> 00:21.222
I'd like to make a
reservation for jury duty.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.324
We usually go to my
mother-in-law, Candace's,

00:23.357 --> 00:27.095
but she's sequestered
on that cruise murder jury.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.529
- I love that trial.
- Me too.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.630
The wife pushed
him overboard.

00:29.663 --> 00:30.398
- Yes.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.832
- I mean,
she's totally guilty.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.567
- Totally.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.405
- So aside from watching
Rachel Maddow

00:37.438 --> 00:40.274
and weeping over the state
of the nation,

00:40.308 --> 00:42.110
what else happens to you
this week?

00:42.143 --> 00:44.078
- Ugh, Friday night is my
second least

00:44.112 --> 00:45.313
favorite night of the year.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.515
- Hospital Holiday Party?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.283
- Santa-Con.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.519
- Ugh! Wait, what's your
least favorite?

00:51.552 --> 00:52.520
- St. Patty's Day.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.189
Green vomit is way worse
than candy cane vomit.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.325
[phones buzz]

00:57.358 --> 00:58.359
- New York Times Alert.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.393
- What did Trump do now?

00:59.427 --> 01:01.262
- The verdict is in on the
Cruise Ship Murder.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.196
- Oh my God!

01:02.230 --> 01:04.332
- Nation shocked as
Marianna Gildersleeve

01:04.365 --> 01:06.400
is found not guilty!

01:06.434 --> 01:07.468
- This can't be happening!

01:07.501 --> 01:10.604
- Right? She clearly pushed
her husband overboard.

01:10.638 --> 01:14.442
- No, if the verdict is in,
that means Candace is...

01:14.475 --> 01:15.576
[Both] Out!

01:15.609 --> 01:19.480
[theme music]
* Hey yes you know

01:19.513 --> 01:24.118
* I'm feeling fine
I'm feeling fine *

01:24.718 --> 01:26.154
- Candace!

01:26.187 --> 01:27.655
- Hello my darlings.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.190
- Hello mother.

01:29.223 --> 01:31.592
- Oh so good to see you.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.628
- Someone's excited to
get gussied up again.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.430
- Hi darling.
- Muah! Muah!

01:36.464 --> 01:39.233
- We've missed you, mom.
- Hello.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.634
- It must feel good to be
back in your everyday life.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.870
- And your own apartment.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.505
So, how are you doing?

01:44.538 --> 01:46.507
- You have no idea what I
have been through.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.342
It was unspeakable.

01:48.376 --> 01:49.877
And it was nothing
short of savage.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.480
I mean there are certain
things one can't unsee.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.316
Unhear. Unsmell.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.285
- I'm so sorry you
had to be exposed to

01:57.318 --> 01:58.686
all those violent,
murderous details.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.889
- I was referring to the
accomodations.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.191
- Would you like
a cocktail?

02:03.224 --> 02:04.592
- Yes, I'd like four
gin and tonics.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.427
- Mother.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.262
- Well, we weren't
allowed to drink!

02:08.296 --> 02:10.464
- Whoa! You weren't allowed
to pound booze?

02:10.498 --> 02:11.532
- Not a drop.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.167
- Not even on the weekends?

02:13.201 --> 02:14.635
- You remember
Juror Number Seven

02:14.668 --> 02:16.737
was whisked away in
the ambulance?

02:16.770 --> 02:19.540
- On the news they said,
"she literally couldn't even."

02:19.573 --> 02:22.543
- She OD'ed on hand
sanitizer.

02:22.576 --> 02:25.413
Apparently, the good stuff
is 120 proof.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.348
- Oh my God, Candace.
I am so sorry.

02:27.381 --> 02:31.452
I had no idea that there
were so many rules

02:31.485 --> 02:34.255
for sequestered jurors.

02:34.288 --> 02:37.691
- There I was, amongst
the great unwashed.

02:37.725 --> 02:40.428
[heavy sigh]

02:42.296 --> 02:45.533
- Settle down everyone
and we'll get started.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.668
- Here, sit.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.403
- Oh no, I couldn't.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.471
- I insist.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.606
- I've sat on a lot of
questionable things in my day,

02:52.640 --> 02:54.708
but I 've got to draw
the line somewhere.

02:54.742 --> 02:58.279
- S.O.P. for sequestered
jurors is simple:

02:58.312 --> 03:00.281
no contact with the
outside world.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.283
- What the heck is S.O.P.?

03:02.316 --> 03:03.984
- Standard Operating
Procedure.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.686
Please memorize it by E.O.D.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.955
- What's E-
- End of Day.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.624
- So no newspapers,
no phone calls,

03:10.658 --> 03:12.426
no email, no internet.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.694
- Wait, no internet
whatsoever?

03:13.727 --> 03:14.628
- Nada.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.264
- Not even Instagram?

03:16.297 --> 03:17.565
How am I supposed to know
what Blue Ivy's eating

03:17.598 --> 03:18.632
for brunch everyday?

03:18.666 --> 03:21.402
- Rules are rules.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.305
- So, it's just us communicating
with each other?

03:24.338 --> 03:25.773
Like, with our mouths?

03:25.806 --> 03:27.741
- For as long as it takes
to reach a verdict.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.311
So, introductions are
in order.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.545
I'll go first.

03:31.579 --> 03:34.682
I'm Pam Tinkler, A.K.A.
Juror Number Four.

03:34.715 --> 03:38.452
I work in H.R. and I'm mom to
three adorable Yorkie puppies

03:38.486 --> 03:40.354
whose pictures I will
not show you

03:40.388 --> 03:42.290
because I'm not here
to make friends,

03:42.323 --> 03:46.594
I'm here to make justice.
Next?

03:46.627 --> 03:47.661
- Uh, what's up everybody?

03:47.695 --> 03:51.732
Um, I'm Scott Hittler, with two
"T"s, no relation.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.700
I'm an actor.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.634
- With that name?

03:53.667 --> 03:54.835
- That's my legal name.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.605
My stage name is
Scott Wayne Gacy.

03:57.638 --> 03:58.772
- Big improvement.

03:58.806 --> 04:02.276
- Recently did a half-day
on SVU, so, let's just say,

04:02.310 --> 04:05.513
I'm quite familiar with the
criminal justice system.

04:05.546 --> 04:08.382
Dun Dun.
You remember that?

04:08.416 --> 04:10.484
Hargitay's a sweetheart,
by the way.

04:10.518 --> 04:11.419
- Next?

04:12.653 --> 04:15.289
- Ugh, it sounds so uncivilized.

04:15.323 --> 04:18.626
- On the bright side,
you are part of history.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.462
The entire nation
was riveted by that trial,

04:21.495 --> 04:22.830
and you were there.

04:22.863 --> 04:23.864
This is one of the
main reasons

04:23.897 --> 04:27.368
I want to be among the first
to colonize Mars.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.808
- Oh. You're not joking.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.844
- I've got nine different
plants on my terrace

04:36.877 --> 04:38.879
growing from my feces.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.349
- Wait, you do?

04:41.382 --> 04:43.717
- I can't get the potatoes to
seed because I think

04:43.751 --> 04:45.853
I should start eating
gluten again.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.888
- Anyway, it must have been
so exciting.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.890
It was the trial of the century!
- Hm.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.659
- I just don't know
how you could

04:51.692 --> 04:53.527
acquit someone so
obviously guilty.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.597
- Oh Brooke, you sound just
like the Prosecution.

04:56.930 --> 05:00.434
- On April 27th, 2014,

05:00.468 --> 05:03.837
Marianna and Tom Gildersleeve
embarked on what should have

05:03.871 --> 05:08.342
been eight days and seven nights
of marital bliss aboard

05:08.376 --> 05:11.679
The Brine and Dandy: a five
star floating hotel

05:11.712 --> 05:18.652
with impeccable amenities and
tantalizing ports of call.

05:18.686 --> 05:22.856
But the prosecution will show,
beyond reasonable doubt,

05:22.890 --> 05:26.527
that the defendant had
only one thing in mind when

05:26.560 --> 05:30.698
she booked those tickets.

05:30.731 --> 05:34.902
Which she paid
for with his money.

05:34.935 --> 05:39.373
She packed his
and her bags.

05:39.407 --> 05:43.844
But Marianna wasn't there for
the 382 foot water slide.

05:43.877 --> 05:47.848
She wasn't there for the
all-you-can-eat paella bar.

05:47.881 --> 05:51.785
No! Marianna Gildersleeve
brought her husband

05:51.819 --> 05:56.724
on that cruise for one thing
and one thing only...

05:56.757 --> 05:59.460
Murder!

05:59.493 --> 06:01.795
[courtroom gasps]

06:01.829 --> 06:04.398
- No remorse.

06:04.432 --> 06:07.968
No shame.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.840
Candace: All right,
let's wrap this up.

06:12.873 --> 06:16.977
All in favor of "not guilty"
raise your hand.

06:17.010 --> 06:21.415
- As an actor, I have a keen
understanding of character.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.584
Marianna was feeling
burned, desperate.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.787
She knew her husband retained
the services of a lawyer.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.490
- But surely you saw
the dopp kit?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.525
- And if they divorced
she'd be broke as a yolk

06:31.559 --> 06:32.760
because of that pre-nup.

06:32.793 --> 06:33.961
- Her only way out of a life
of poverty-

06:33.994 --> 06:35.563
[knocking]

06:35.596 --> 06:37.465
- Order in the courtyard!

06:37.498 --> 06:39.500
U.N.C.!
Under No Circumstances

06:39.533 --> 06:42.603
are we to discuss the details
of the trial after hours!

06:42.636 --> 06:44.605
We are here to deliberate
whether we're going to watch

06:44.638 --> 06:48.776
Seabiscuit or Beethoven's 2nd
and take Steak & Shake orders.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.612
Alyssa, should I put you down
for roast beef?

06:51.645 --> 06:53.213
Third night in a row?

06:53.246 --> 06:54.782
- It's only been three
nights?!

06:54.815 --> 06:55.949
[terrified tones]

06:55.983 --> 07:01.655
- Did you end up watching
Seabiscuit or Beethoven's 2nd?

07:01.689 --> 07:04.024
Seabisuit is a classic

07:04.057 --> 07:08.529
and Debi Mazar's got some real
zingers in Beethoven's 2nd.

07:08.562 --> 07:11.031
- I went back to my room
just to find anything

07:11.064 --> 07:15.769
to just have a like
a skosh of joy.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.672
- Here's Captivating Cascade.
- Look at this.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.940
- Oh boy.
- It's $300.

07:19.973 --> 07:20.941
[remote control clicks]

07:20.974 --> 07:22.476
Now I realize that's not like
rolling around

07:22.510 --> 07:23.744
in the bottom
of my purse either but

07:23.777 --> 07:25.245
for a necklace like this.
- Wow.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.014
- That's it?
One channel?!

07:27.047 --> 07:29.216
- This is all genuine
Mother of Pearl.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.051
Now, holy smokes.
- Mmm-hmm.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.721
- This is a very elevated
fabulous thing.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.622
Now look at Sonja.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.823
- Hello movie star.
- Hello gorgeous.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.958
- Look at this necklace.

07:37.991 --> 07:41.529
- It's just so elevated
and divine.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.631
- According to your sworn
affidavit,

07:43.664 --> 07:45.966
you were aboard the cruise ship
celebrating your honeymoon,

07:45.999 --> 07:46.834
is that correct?

07:46.867 --> 07:47.701
- Yes.

07:47.735 --> 07:48.669
- Congratulations.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.704
- That was three
years ago, but thank you.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.239
- And on the night
in question-

07:52.272 --> 07:53.941
- I wanted a beach
honeymoon,

07:53.974 --> 07:55.776
but Joey wanted more
of a city experience,

07:55.809 --> 07:57.044
so a cruise seemed
like the perfect compromise.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.579
We could lounge poolside

07:58.612 --> 08:00.013
in between exotic
destinations.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.915
Plus, we both loved the idea
of going to a bunch of

08:01.949 --> 08:03.717
different places but
without the hassle of

08:03.751 --> 08:05.686
constantly packing and
unpacking, you know?

08:05.719 --> 08:08.556
- And on the night in
question,

08:08.589 --> 08:11.659
were you seated next to
Mr. and Mrs. Gildersleeve

08:11.692 --> 08:13.861
on the fine-dining
concourse?

08:13.894 --> 08:14.928
- We sure were.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.897
My husband wanted to
sit next to this old couple

08:16.930 --> 08:18.599
'cause their table
looked kind of empty,

08:18.632 --> 08:19.867
but while we walking
over there,

08:19.900 --> 08:21.669
I was like,
why is it empty?

08:21.702 --> 08:25.873
Like did they have that musty,
skin flap, septuagenerian smell?

08:25.906 --> 08:28.642
So we changed course to
Tom and Marianna's table-

08:28.676 --> 08:30.711
- So how would you
characterize

08:30.744 --> 08:32.813
the bahavior of
the Gildersleeves?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.082
In fifteen words or less.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.018
- Oh my God, they
were so cute and flirty.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.754
Like, they straight up
canoodled their way

08:40.788 --> 08:43.624
through the iceberg wedge and
the coconut shrimps-

08:43.657 --> 08:47.595
- So, Mrs. Slutsky, what
caused Mr. Gildersleeve

08:47.628 --> 08:53.000
to suddenly throw down his white
linen napkin and storm out?

08:53.033 --> 08:55.035
- Meatballs.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.036
- Meatballs?

08:56.069 --> 08:59.607
- The dish was a trigger
for Tom Gildersleeve.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.977
A red-sauced reminder of his
wife's torrid affair.

09:07.715 --> 09:08.682
- But what do meatballs have
to do with an affair?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.952
- The first Thursday of
every month

09:11.985 --> 09:14.054
is Meatball Night at Nelio's.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.757
That was the standing date for
Marianna Gildersleeve

09:16.790 --> 09:19.326
and her illicit paramour,
Mike Bauer.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.228
At a pre-determined time,

09:21.261 --> 09:24.164
they would excuse
themselves from the table,

09:24.197 --> 09:27.234
go have sex in the
bathroom while their spouses

09:27.267 --> 09:30.003
sat clueless
in the dining room.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.204
- Wait, this is huge!

09:31.238 --> 09:33.206
How is this affair not
on the news?

09:33.240 --> 09:34.775
- It was stricken from
the record.

09:34.808 --> 09:35.743
- Why would they strike it?

09:35.776 --> 09:37.745
It proves that Marianna
was a gold-digger

09:37.778 --> 09:39.980
who wanted to
off her husband,

09:40.013 --> 09:43.684
inherit his millions and then
run away with Mike Bauer!

09:43.717 --> 09:45.953
- I bet the Defense objected
arguing that it wasn't relevant

09:45.986 --> 09:46.954
and the judge agreed.

09:46.987 --> 09:47.755
- Exactly.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.322
- But, it's a motive
for murder!

09:49.356 --> 09:50.357
- Yes, thank you.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.792
- How do you not see that?

09:51.825 --> 09:53.160
Are we living on Mars?

09:53.193 --> 09:54.327
- No offense.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.363
- None taken.
We will be soon.

09:56.396 --> 09:59.266
- According to the woman
in the neighboring suite,

09:59.299 --> 10:02.670
she heard Marianna
and her husband argueing.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.272
But it didn't mean she was
a credible ear-witness.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.406
[suspenseful tone]

10:06.439 --> 10:10.277
- It was about 7:35pm.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.380
I know because I
was watching The Wheel.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.116
I heard a door slam and
some muffled voices.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.652
And then I heard
a man's voice say

10:18.686 --> 10:21.088
"I want a divorce."

10:21.121 --> 10:23.223
- And you're sure
you heard him say,

10:23.256 --> 10:26.393
"I want a divorce."

10:26.426 --> 10:30.363
- As sure as buying a
vowel is a fool's move.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.399
- Thank you, Ms. Popernick.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.334
No further questions.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.303
- Ms. Popernick,
have you ever had

10:36.336 --> 10:38.739
your hearing checked by
a professional?

10:38.772 --> 10:40.373
- Uh, no.

10:40.407 --> 10:46.747
- Thanks. Bailiffs,
if you will?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.685
Your Honor, I present
Exhibit 34-A.

10:51.719 --> 10:52.552
[knocks]

10:52.585 --> 10:54.688
Please listen to
the following phrase

10:54.722 --> 10:58.458
and tell me what
you hear.

10:58.491 --> 11:02.763
- I want a (muffled).

11:02.796 --> 11:04.364
- I want a divorce.

11:04.397 --> 11:07.100
From taperecorder:
I want the main course.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.236
- Objection!

11:09.269 --> 11:11.238
This bit of scenery
hardly duplicates

11:11.271 --> 11:13.073
the conditions of
a crime scene.

11:13.106 --> 11:17.778
- Your Honor, Exhibit 34-A
was built to scale

11:17.811 --> 11:19.780
and used the actual materials
from a Brine and Dandy

11:19.813 --> 11:24.117
stateroom suite, just...

11:24.151 --> 11:25.452
like the
Gildersleeves-es.

11:25.485 --> 11:26.854
- Overruled.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.322
[scoffs]

11:29.356 --> 11:30.357
- What's going on?

11:30.390 --> 11:31.792
- Let's try this again.

11:31.825 --> 11:32.893
It's fun, right?

11:32.926 --> 11:36.296
[quirky music]

11:36.329 --> 11:38.498
- I want a (muffled).

11:38.531 --> 11:41.334
- I want a...divorce?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.771
From taperecorder:
I want a seahorse.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.272
[taperecorder crashes
and breaks]

11:45.305 --> 11:46.840
- Wha-
Come on!

11:46.874 --> 11:50.277
- No further questions,
your Honor.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.444
- Is he allowed to do that?

11:54.147 --> 11:55.916
[thump]
[people in courtroom gasp]

11:55.949 --> 11:57.117
Offscreen: Is she okay?

11:58.385 --> 12:00.353
- I love what you've
done with the place.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.290
You know, this duvet
looks just like one I saw

12:03.323 --> 12:04.825
last week on HSN.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.359
- Imagine that.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.328
- We're not allowed to have
unsupervised contact

12:08.361 --> 12:10.363
with the outside world.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.132
How'd you smuggle
all this in?

12:12.165 --> 12:13.433
- Everybody has their
price, darling.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.336
- Amazing!

12:16.369 --> 12:18.839
When you sashay down
Madison Avenue,

12:18.872 --> 12:21.875
I bet men run after you
like Cher at Gay Pride.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.410
- Dear, the only people
who should run

12:23.443 --> 12:25.478
are children and thieves.

12:25.512 --> 12:30.350
- What I wouldn't do to walk
a mile in your shoes.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.485
May I?

12:32.519 --> 12:34.354
- You want to?

12:40.293 --> 12:42.830
- [laughing]
I think

12:42.863 --> 12:45.198
you'd really do better
in cone heels.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.801
- With so many options,
how do you choose?

12:47.835 --> 12:49.302
- What, men or heels?

12:49.336 --> 12:50.871
- Both!

12:50.904 --> 12:53.440
- When it comes to men
I only have one rule:

12:53.473 --> 12:55.843
I refuse to be a
nurse or a purse.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.883
- Do they carry compression
socks on HSN?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.151
I'm starting to get
varicose veins

13:04.184 --> 13:06.419
from sitting in that
jury box all day.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.654
- What's in it for me?

13:07.687 --> 13:10.891
- How about you hook me up with
stuff from the outside world

13:10.924 --> 13:12.425
and I'll do your hair?

13:12.459 --> 13:15.428
I run a salon I.R.L.
as Pam would say.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.930
- All right, deal.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.432
But if you keep
speaking like Pam,

13:19.466 --> 13:21.568
you and your spider
veins are on your own.

13:21.601 --> 13:22.802
- Rawr.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.375
- Hi.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.442
- You got the goods?

13:29.476 --> 13:31.845
- Prescription painkillers,
forty milligrams each.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.450
- Mmm.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.024
Here we are.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.927
Your 3-in-1 Roaster, Smoker,
Grill with a recipe book.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.328
- Bless you!

13:48.361 --> 13:51.264
- Nothing like the smell
of a good Montecristo.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.332
How'd you come by these?

13:52.365 --> 13:53.867
- I had a bit part on Narcos.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.535
The Prop Assist had
a crush on me.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.409
- Thank you, from
the bottom of my core.

14:04.644 --> 14:05.845
- Okay.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.355
[phone rings]

14:15.388 --> 14:17.991
- Oh, excsuse me.
Apologies.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.126
- Oh, Brooke!

14:19.159 --> 14:21.661
I saw one of your bags on
the street today in pink.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.931
- Oh, we don't do pastels,
it's a knockoff.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.365
The city is crawling
with them.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.234
- Who do I have to sue?

14:27.267 --> 14:28.435
- Oh, it's just what happens

14:28.468 --> 14:31.972
when you reach a certain
level of success.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.974
- Hi!
What's happening?

14:34.007 --> 14:36.676
- This dinner is taking longer
than the deliberation.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.611
- Have you gotten any
juicy deets?

14:38.645 --> 14:40.413
- Only stuff that makes me
even more convinced

14:40.447 --> 14:42.249
that Marianna is guilty!

14:42.282 --> 14:44.251
- So how the hell
did they let her walk?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.586
Did the jury actually buy
the Filthy Sheets Defense?

14:46.619 --> 14:48.521
- We're not even
there yet!

14:48.555 --> 14:49.656
But honestly?

14:49.689 --> 14:52.025
If Candace led the charge in
letting this Black Widow

14:52.059 --> 14:54.294
go free and she kills again?

14:54.327 --> 14:56.463
That's blood on our hands.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.399
- This is why mere mortals
shouldn't mess with fate.

14:59.432 --> 15:03.436
- Uh, as a doctor, isn't that
what you do on a daily basis?

15:03.470 --> 15:06.573
- Uh, excuse me, Compound
Fracture Santa,

15:06.606 --> 15:07.674
you can't pee there.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.043
You either,
Bloody Nose Santa.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.679
Okay, I gotta go.

15:12.712 --> 15:13.680
- Sorry, look.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.983
I feel like we're talking
about the OJ Trial

15:16.016 --> 15:17.517
and avoiding the glove.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.952
Let's get to the good shit!

15:18.986 --> 15:20.387
- Filthy Sheets!

15:20.420 --> 15:23.390
- Flithy Sheets!
- Filthy Sheets!

15:23.423 --> 15:25.658
- Okay, okay.
Simmer down.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.127
After the couple argued,

15:27.160 --> 15:29.062
Tom was never seen alive
again.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.598
But Marianna was spotted
at the discothèque

15:31.631 --> 15:36.469
lambada-ing with a bachelor
party from Scottsdale at 3am.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.604
- Guilty!
- Guilty!

15:37.637 --> 15:40.373
- You know, you chant
"Filthy Sheets"

15:40.407 --> 15:42.609
but you deny its power.

15:42.642 --> 15:47.014
It is a potent tincture that
does terrifyingly erotic things

15:47.047 --> 15:51.518
to your mind and your body.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.720
- This isn't Midsummer
Night's Dream.

15:53.753 --> 15:57.424
You can't tell me that some New
Age witch In the East Village

15:57.457 --> 16:02.495
is gonna concoct a potion
that's gonna make me a vixen.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.331
- Care to try some
for yourself?

16:04.364 --> 16:06.633
- What?!
- Whoa!

16:07.200 --> 16:09.569
- Please state your name
and profession.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.771
- Morag Schwartz,
co-executive potion

16:11.804 --> 16:14.074
master at Enchantments.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.776
- Can you describe your
workplace?

16:16.809 --> 16:19.512
- We're the oldest occult
store in North America.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.414
There's one in New Orleans
that claims to be,

16:21.448 --> 16:24.517
but they're just a lesbian
candle shop trying to rebrand.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.686
- Three days before the
cruise set sail,

16:26.719 --> 16:29.589
did my client visit your
workplace for advice?

16:29.622 --> 16:32.025
- We did a spiritual
consultation.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.194
- Marianna was seeking
something

16:34.227 --> 16:35.628
that would help save
her marriage.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.429
- So you sold her
a love spell?

16:36.463 --> 16:38.798
- I sold her a dram of
Filthy Sheets.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.534
It's a potent oil for
sexual attraction

16:41.568 --> 16:45.738
which when combined with the
right intention - is undeniable.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.075
- What was Marianna's
intention?

16:48.108 --> 16:50.643
- To dip her wick.

16:50.677 --> 16:54.747
- To dip her wick!

16:54.781 --> 16:57.117
And if her husband
rejected her,

16:57.150 --> 17:01.654
could Filthy Sheets
make her do this?!

17:01.688 --> 17:03.056
[people in courtroom gasp]

17:03.090 --> 17:05.725
- Uh-huh.
And so much more.

17:05.758 --> 17:12.665
- If the sheets are filthy,
then she is not guilthy!

17:12.699 --> 17:17.637
[tense music]
[indistinct chatter]

17:17.670 --> 17:20.673
- Okay, let's say she was D.U.I.
Dancing Under the Influence.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.475
All that proves is that
she's not a-

17:22.509 --> 17:23.443
- Skank!

17:23.476 --> 17:24.444
- Hoe bag!

17:24.477 --> 17:25.678
- But it doesn't prove that
she's innocent.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.514
- Finally we agree!

17:27.547 --> 17:29.749
Marianna Gildersleeve
killed her husband.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.619
- Were you so deep in your
HSN addiction

17:32.652 --> 17:34.554
that you couldn't
see the truth?

17:34.587 --> 17:37.790
- Actually, thanks to my
Daisy Fuentes readers,

17:37.824 --> 17:41.528
I could see the truth
perfectly clear.

17:41.561 --> 17:46.866
[angelic music]

17:50.737 --> 17:55.708
[TV static noise]

17:55.742 --> 17:57.677
- No HSN?

17:57.710 --> 18:00.113
Oh come on!

18:03.616 --> 18:08.188
Is your TV working?

18:08.221 --> 18:13.226
[quirky music]

18:18.765 --> 18:19.866
Yes.

18:20.833 --> 18:28.275
[quirky music continues]

18:33.513 --> 18:39.886
No, Pam got wind of your
operation and shut it down!

18:46.393 --> 18:47.194
Who here thinks Marianna
is guilty?

18:51.331 --> 18:52.665
And who votes
not guilty?

18:52.699 --> 18:57.437
[suspenseful tones]

19:00.473 --> 19:03.343
I.A.N.A.L. but the
evidence-

19:03.376 --> 19:04.644
- I anal?

19:04.677 --> 19:06.713
- I Am Not A Lawyer,
but the evidence-

19:06.746 --> 19:10.883
- Pamela, please show
everyone Exhibit 4-D.

19:10.917 --> 19:15.455
[tense tones]

19:19.359 --> 19:22.962
See this prescription
of Sildenafil Citrate?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.498
Who knows
what that is?

19:25.532 --> 19:29.536
Oh come on, gentlemen.
Carlos?

19:29.569 --> 19:32.372
- Erectile dysfunction,
but I-

19:32.405 --> 19:35.308
- If Marianna were planning
on killing her husband,

19:35.342 --> 19:40.513
why would she bring
along his ED meds?

19:40.547 --> 19:41.448
- Oh come on.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.515
This is ridiculous!

19:42.549 --> 19:44.284
- Why bother to
pleasure someone

19:44.317 --> 19:46.219
you're planning on offing?

19:46.253 --> 19:47.019
- Face it, Pam.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.389
The Filthy Sheets,
the ED meds.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.524
Marianna's motivation for
booking the cruise

19:51.558 --> 19:55.528
wasn't to murder him,
it was to win him back!

19:55.562 --> 19:57.564
It's just like that
three-episode arc I did on-

19:57.597 --> 20:00.733
- Zip it, Hittler.

20:00.767 --> 20:10.543
- If she packed the boner pill,
then she did not kill.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.646
- Come on, Pam.
You know she's right.

20:13.680 --> 20:19.586
[suspenseful tune]

20:19.619 --> 20:21.288
- Fine, NG.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.790
- Not guilty.

20:23.823 --> 20:24.957
- Oh thank God.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.427
- Amen!
The system works.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.562
- Another white person
goes free.

20:29.596 --> 20:32.532
- Hand Sani-tinis for all!

20:32.565 --> 20:34.000
[jurors applaud]

20:34.033 --> 20:37.470
- Holy shit!
ED meds got her off.

20:37.504 --> 20:38.638
- It's a shame
no one can know

20:38.671 --> 20:40.707
because we are actual heroes.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.310
If we hadn't put Candace on
that jury,

20:43.343 --> 20:46.012
an innocent woman would
have been sentenced to life.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.747
- And we would have been
sentenced to

20:47.780 --> 20:50.783
an 8-hour documentary on Netflix
about her road to exoneration.

20:50.817 --> 20:54.020
- Oh, I gotta go.
Love you.

20:56.055 --> 20:56.589
What?

20:56.623 --> 21:03.430
- Filthy Sheets, baby.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.064
[screams in disgust]

21:05.097 --> 21:07.334
- Oh! That's supposed
to be an aphrodisiac?

21:07.367 --> 21:08.368
- Oh!

21:08.401 --> 21:09.836
- It smells like
Stevie Nicks' shawl closet.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.639
- No.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.007
- Chinese food farts?

21:15.041 --> 21:16.509
- Ack, no.

21:16.543 --> 21:19.712
- Chris Christie's office chair.

21:19.746 --> 21:23.049
So that's a no.

21:23.082 --> 21:23.850
