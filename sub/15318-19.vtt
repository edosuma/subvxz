00:01.833 --> 00:02.759
Who are you?

00:02.760 --> 00:04.226
Let's just say I'm someone

00:04.227 --> 00:05.526
who's chosen to embrace
the full spectrum

00:05.528 --> 00:07.195
of our reality.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.644
Um, FBI's
at the front gate.

00:10.646 --> 00:12.942
Will! Abby... Corrigan?

00:12.943 --> 00:14.739
I think it's going quite well.

00:14.741 --> 00:16.642
When I first
knew you at Oxford,

00:16.644 --> 00:18.340
I loved you
with my entire being.

00:20.912 --> 00:22.375
You destroyed my heart, John,

00:22.377 --> 00:24.811
the hatred you feel
towards me...

00:24.813 --> 00:27.678
Then the way you would
harm our daughter.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.513
Fair warning, Dr. Zimmerman,

00:29.515 --> 00:31.816
you're about to leave
the world you know behind.

00:31.818 --> 00:33.285
I'm a psychologist.

00:33.287 --> 00:34.853
You work with monsters.

00:34.855 --> 00:36.957
But I can promise you
the adventure

00:36.959 --> 00:38.897
of many,
many lifetimes.

00:40.267 --> 00:41.834
Shall we begin?

Hey! Hey, wait!

00:52.855 --> 00:53.921
Wait!

00:53.923 --> 00:56.593
Aw, come on!

00:56.595 --> 00:59.232
It's not even 8:00 yet!

00:59.234 --> 01:00.800
Did you
catch them?

01:00.802 --> 01:03.405
No, and I don't think
last week's salmon

01:03.407 --> 01:04.973
wants to stay
with us either.

01:04.974 --> 01:08.243
Oh, wonderful.

01:08.245 --> 01:09.878
Roy, I hope you
get your timing

01:09.880 --> 01:12.248
from your mother,
and not me.

01:13.250 --> 01:16.319
We are not naming
our daughter "Roy."

01:16.321 --> 01:19.890
Yes, we are, if <i> he</i> is going
to be a major leaguer.

01:19.892 --> 01:21.459
There's a Cy Young
award-winner in there,

01:21.461 --> 01:23.494
I can feel it.

01:24.497 --> 01:26.898
Surgery can't start
without you.

01:28.267 --> 01:29.868
Go be brilliant.

01:29.870 --> 01:32.404
You put your feet up
and eat bon-bons, okay?

01:32.406 --> 01:34.039
I have prenatal yoga

01:34.041 --> 01:35.641
in an hour.

01:35.643 --> 01:37.744
Chocolate.
Roy wants chocolate.

01:40.549 --> 01:41.883
Love you.

01:41.885 --> 01:44.452
Love you.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.456
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

01:52.064 --> 01:53.564
Come here.

01:53.566 --> 01:55.466
Come here.

01:56.403 --> 01:57.903
Come here.

01:57.905 --> 01:59.905
Come here...

01:59.907 --> 02:01.307
Come here, come here.

02:05.380 --> 02:06.546
Okay...

02:11.318 --> 02:12.985
Just... just relax.

02:30.803 --> 02:33.740
On the trunk of my car.

02:33.742 --> 02:34.707
Again.

02:34.709 --> 02:35.742
Come here,
Henry, darling.

02:36.945 --> 02:38.979
You all right?

02:38.981 --> 02:40.848
I've got him.

02:40.850 --> 02:43.084
You know, you might want
to think about declawing him

02:43.086 --> 02:44.986
before he scratches
the paint on my Beemer,

02:44.988 --> 02:47.523
or maybe just don't
let him out so much.

02:47.525 --> 02:49.626
"Declaw"?

02:49.628 --> 02:50.527
He's an innocent creature.

02:50.529 --> 02:52.462
Unlike your dog,

02:52.464 --> 02:55.766
who keeps doing his
business on my lawn.

02:55.768 --> 02:57.435
Monty?

02:57.437 --> 02:59.037
No, that's not possible.
We have a dog-walker.

02:59.039 --> 03:01.407
Keep him on your side
of the street.

03:02.709 --> 03:03.609
What the hell is that?

03:03.611 --> 03:05.411
Oi!

03:10.418 --> 03:11.552
Are you quite through?

03:12.821 --> 03:16.457
Uh... I'm sorry, I just
thought I saw something.

03:16.459 --> 03:18.393
When I want you
in my house, Dr. Zimmerman,

03:18.395 --> 03:20.128
I will invite you into my house.

03:20.130 --> 03:23.099
Don't expect that invitation
anytime soon!

03:23.101 --> 03:24.734
Get out!

03:24.736 --> 03:26.168
Right.

03:26.170 --> 03:29.172
Sorry. I just...

I'm just saying,

04:00.582 --> 04:02.854
a water birth has
all sorts of advantages

04:02.978 --> 04:04.053
later on in life.

04:05.422 --> 04:07.822
I don't know, it just
sounds so gimmicky.

04:07.824 --> 04:09.958
It's low lights,

04:09.960 --> 04:13.495
a soothing sensation
similar to the womb.

04:13.497 --> 04:15.130
The sounds of
water lapping

04:15.132 --> 04:16.932
as her first sounds...

04:16.934 --> 04:18.968
You see, this is why
I chose cardiology.

04:18.970 --> 04:23.139
Less tinkie-woo-woo crap,
and more hard medical science.

04:23.141 --> 04:24.975
No, Will, you became
a heart surgeon

04:24.977 --> 04:25.976
to please your mother.

04:25.978 --> 04:28.345
I became a heart surgeon...

04:28.347 --> 04:30.047
For the chicks.

04:30.049 --> 04:32.049
Please.

04:33.586 --> 04:35.819
Go.

04:40.358 --> 04:42.459
Oh, dammit.

04:42.461 --> 04:44.161
They keep wanting
to pull up the surgery.

04:44.163 --> 04:45.663
It'll be fine, honey.

04:45.665 --> 04:47.498
Well, not if the poor bastard
dies during the procedure.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.432
He won't.

04:48.434 --> 04:50.100
You'll be brilliant.

04:51.303 --> 04:52.970
Two weeks from now,

04:52.972 --> 04:56.006
everybody will be
talking about

04:56.008 --> 04:59.076
the Zimmerman bypass
tri-valve procedure.

04:59.078 --> 05:00.311
It does have a ring to it,
doesn't it?

05:00.313 --> 05:03.381
Your mother
would be proud.

05:03.383 --> 05:05.516
<i>Will, stay where you are.</i>

05:05.518 --> 05:07.519
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

05:07.521 --> 05:08.520
<i>It's all right.</i>

05:10.155 --> 05:12.957
Honey?

05:12.959 --> 05:16.628
Yeah, uh, my mom,
I should call her.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.719
What do you make
of this Druitt guy?

06:51.721 --> 06:54.623
Mm, well, I think
he'd make a good mayor.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.425
That's 'cause

06:56.427 --> 06:58.094
he's tough on crime.

06:59.731 --> 07:02.031
Ah, there's something about him
that just doesn't ring true,

07:02.033 --> 07:03.299
but then again,
he is a politician,

07:03.301 --> 07:04.534
so...

07:04.536 --> 07:06.203
Hey, Rumpelstiltskin.

07:06.205 --> 07:07.571
I could barely get you
out of bed this morning.

07:07.573 --> 07:10.140
Yeah, I did have
a little trouble sleeping.

07:11.243 --> 07:13.276
But don't you mean
Rip Van Winkle?

07:15.614 --> 07:17.380
You're right.

07:19.150 --> 07:21.650
I had these
bizarre dreams.

07:21.652 --> 07:25.153
Like, mad scientists
and labs.

07:25.155 --> 07:27.255
All this Sci-Fi stuff.

07:27.257 --> 07:31.225
Bizarre subtextual images,
totally dissociative.

07:31.227 --> 07:34.262
Well, well, look who remembers
their psych rotation.

07:35.565 --> 07:37.231
It's stress, hon'.

07:37.233 --> 07:38.499
The baby's coming in a month,

07:38.501 --> 07:40.068
and you've got
this big surgery,

07:40.070 --> 07:41.336
and then all
these conferences

07:41.338 --> 07:42.437
that they keep
wanting you to go to--

07:42.439 --> 07:44.305
Why do you think
she stays up all night?

07:44.307 --> 07:48.409
Who-- oh, creepy McPaintsalot
across the street?

07:48.411 --> 07:49.344
Yeah.

07:49.346 --> 07:51.446
I have no idea.

07:51.448 --> 07:52.680
Maybe that's when

07:52.682 --> 07:53.782
when her creative
juices are flowing.

07:53.784 --> 07:55.484
Artists are odd
like that.

07:55.486 --> 07:58.020
But I've never seen
any of her paintings.

07:58.022 --> 07:59.488
I mean, have you ever
seen her show

07:59.490 --> 08:01.257
any of her paintings?

08:01.259 --> 08:03.794
I think you think too much
about our cat-lady neighbor.

08:05.730 --> 08:07.664
And I think it is time
for you to go

08:07.666 --> 08:09.533
and be brilliant.

08:09.535 --> 08:11.534
Mm, yes.

08:11.536 --> 08:12.602
Love you.

08:12.604 --> 08:14.070
Mmm.

08:14.072 --> 08:15.405
Love you.

09:20.537 --> 09:22.305
Bloody hell.

09:36.753 --> 09:38.120
Hello!

09:38.122 --> 09:41.523
Uh, Helen, isn't it?

09:41.525 --> 09:43.157
Abby, right?

09:43.159 --> 09:45.293
And company.

09:46.863 --> 09:48.830
Sorry, was the music
too loud last night?

09:48.832 --> 09:50.365
Did it keep you up?

09:50.367 --> 09:52.234
Or perhaps it's the cat.

09:52.236 --> 09:53.602
The cat?

09:53.604 --> 09:55.170
Uh... oh!

09:55.172 --> 09:57.139
Oh, gosh, no!

09:57.141 --> 10:00.576
No, no, that's not
why I came over.

10:00.578 --> 10:03.213
No, I'm not here
with a complaint.

10:03.215 --> 10:04.514
You're not?

10:04.516 --> 10:05.515
No...

10:05.517 --> 10:06.616
I just was at home,

10:06.618 --> 10:07.918
and I was thinking how
we never get to see you,

10:07.920 --> 10:10.387
and I thought, um,

10:10.389 --> 10:12.222
"that's not very neighborly,"

10:12.224 --> 10:14.257
so I...

10:14.259 --> 10:16.826
Baked you these.

10:16.828 --> 10:18.561
Scottish shortbread.

10:18.563 --> 10:20.463
Because you're Scottish, so...

10:21.499 --> 10:22.899
English, actually.

10:22.901 --> 10:24.234
They're lovely.

10:24.236 --> 10:26.169
Thank-thank you.

10:26.171 --> 10:27.737
Well...

10:29.640 --> 10:33.342
Uh, how is the painting coming?

10:35.546 --> 10:38.314
D-do you show your work?

10:38.316 --> 10:40.883
At, w-what, um, I guess

10:40.885 --> 10:43.686
those wine and cheese
gallery openings?

10:43.688 --> 10:46.823
Oh, I would love
to see your work.

10:46.825 --> 10:50.326
I don't show my work.

10:50.328 --> 10:53.629
My agent sells it privately
to buyers.

10:53.631 --> 10:55.464
Oh, I...hmm.

10:55.466 --> 10:57.266
That's... good for you.

11:03.941 --> 11:06.242
So, how are you feeling?

11:06.244 --> 11:08.778
You look to be about what,
32, 33 weeks.

11:08.780 --> 11:11.749
Ultrasound showing
good bone development?

11:11.751 --> 11:13.216
33 weeks exactly.

11:14.253 --> 11:15.252
Do you have kids?

11:19.925 --> 11:20.891
I-I...

11:22.728 --> 11:23.828
<i>Mom?</i>

11:23.830 --> 11:25.530
I'm sorry.

11:25.532 --> 11:26.531
I-I didn't mean to pry.

11:26.533 --> 11:27.833
I just, uh...

11:27.835 --> 11:32.370
Well, you-you just seemed
to know so much about, uh...

11:36.574 --> 11:39.543
Thank you, very much.

11:39.545 --> 11:42.511
Yes.

12:11.843 --> 12:13.876
Jackasses.

12:19.783 --> 12:21.717
Tough day.

12:25.823 --> 12:27.556
Sorry, did you say something?

12:33.797 --> 12:35.431
I said, "tough day."

13:08.742 --> 13:10.076
The patient displays
multiple symptoms,

13:10.078 --> 13:12.879
though cannot find etiology
for said arrhythmia.

13:12.881 --> 13:14.448
Suspect...

13:16.517 --> 13:17.818
Embolism.

13:17.820 --> 13:19.219
Suspect embolism
may be involved.

13:19.221 --> 13:21.857
Recommended treatment,
ACE inhibitor, diuretics,

13:21.859 --> 13:22.924
as well as anti...

13:25.895 --> 13:27.630
Anti...

13:28.932 --> 13:30.833
Coagulants?

13:30.835 --> 13:32.635
Crap.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.170
Delete last comment.

13:38.509 --> 13:40.276
Man...

13:41.478 --> 13:43.379
I'm losing it here.

13:55.826 --> 13:58.395
Brain activity is in the red.

13:58.397 --> 14:00.297
Approaching delta.

14:00.299 --> 14:01.665
Give a dosage at the same level.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.567
Yeah, I got it.

14:03.569 --> 14:05.569
Yes.

14:05.571 --> 14:07.438
It's working.

14:56.723 --> 14:58.290
<i>Ah, Helen, how lovely</i>
<i>to hear from you.</i>

14:58.292 --> 14:59.858
Yes, I know I said
I'd call you, George,

14:59.860 --> 15:00.959
but I forgot.

15:00.961 --> 15:02.494
<i>You forgot!</i>

15:02.496 --> 15:03.862
I've been having trouble
remembering things

15:03.864 --> 15:05.697
these last few days.

15:05.699 --> 15:07.833
I just,
I need to take a break.

15:07.835 --> 15:09.735
<i>Helen, you owe me</i>
<i>a new series.</i>

15:09.737 --> 15:12.471
Yes, I know I promised you
new pieces this month,

15:12.473 --> 15:13.639
but I can't.

15:13.641 --> 15:15.307
<i>What does that mean?</i>

15:15.309 --> 15:18.677
Well... things aren't--
aren't going well right now.

15:18.679 --> 15:20.813
<i>What did you have</i>
<i>in mind instead?</i>

15:20.815 --> 15:22.114
What do I want to do instead?

15:22.116 --> 15:23.782
I don't know, I want to
travel, I want to--

15:23.784 --> 15:24.683
<i>travel?</i>

15:24.685 --> 15:25.851
Help homeless children,

15:25.853 --> 15:27.886
work with animals,
go on safari.

15:27.888 --> 15:29.421
God, something more!

15:29.423 --> 15:30.956
<i>Listen to</i>
<i>yourself, Helen--</i>

15:30.958 --> 15:32.491
Bloody agents!

16:03.023 --> 16:04.556
This isn't right.

16:27.645 --> 16:30.980
No, no, no, what is she doing?

16:30.982 --> 16:32.781
What are you doing, huh?

16:32.783 --> 16:34.116
Hmm?

16:36.353 --> 16:37.619
No, no, no, no,
easy, easy...

16:37.621 --> 16:39.388
Yeah...

16:39.390 --> 16:40.689
There.

16:40.691 --> 16:42.991
Time to go
back to sleep.

16:42.993 --> 16:44.126
It may be time

16:44.128 --> 16:47.362
to bring out
the big guns, huh?

16:52.503 --> 16:54.804
God, it's actually
getting worse.

16:57.042 --> 16:58.675
Coming!

17:00.411 --> 17:03.113
Please don't have
any more shortbread.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.958
Hello, Helen.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.960
Did you think
I'd forgotten you?

17:16.962 --> 17:18.895
This isn't a good time.
I'm working.

17:18.896 --> 17:20.162
I'm sorry, darling.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.631
I came to pick up
a few last things.

17:22.633 --> 17:23.732
What things?

17:32.107 --> 17:33.975
I see.

17:33.977 --> 17:36.177
I'm starting
a new series.

17:36.179 --> 17:39.046
A clean slate,
new ideas, so on.

17:39.048 --> 17:43.751
Yeah, very new ideas.

17:48.591 --> 17:51.627
And we are back
to last year.

17:51.629 --> 17:54.162
Why are you
really here?

17:54.164 --> 17:55.430
You've taken everything
that mattered.

17:55.432 --> 17:57.532
Not everything.

17:59.135 --> 18:01.469
Please, John, I'm tired.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.138
You heard about the case?

18:03.140 --> 18:05.907
Conviction,
sentencing.

18:05.909 --> 18:07.742
It's done, over.

18:07.744 --> 18:09.844
Yes, congratulations.

18:09.846 --> 18:11.179
Thank you.

18:11.181 --> 18:12.447
I see you're already
decorating the mayor's office

18:12.449 --> 18:13.682
for yourself.

18:13.684 --> 18:16.151
The press having a bit of fun.

18:16.153 --> 18:20.122
Me?

18:20.124 --> 18:22.458
I have other ideas.

18:30.834 --> 18:33.168
You're leaving the DA's office?

18:33.170 --> 18:34.469
You can't be serious.

18:34.471 --> 18:35.504
I was thinking of
a private practice

18:35.506 --> 18:37.839
at a small firm.

18:37.841 --> 18:40.108
Half-time.

18:40.110 --> 18:43.077
Flexible hours.

18:43.079 --> 18:46.647
I already have offers.

18:46.649 --> 18:47.715
A normal life.

18:56.025 --> 18:57.092
I was hoping
this would be

18:57.094 --> 18:58.127
our divorce papers,

18:58.129 --> 18:59.095
signed by you.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.997
Helen, you don't want this--

19:00.999 --> 19:02.165
Don't tell me what I want!

19:02.167 --> 19:03.299
All right.

19:04.735 --> 19:07.538
Then you say it.

19:07.540 --> 19:10.173
What do you want?

19:18.616 --> 19:19.783
Not this.

19:21.185 --> 19:22.786
Not what we had.

19:24.255 --> 19:27.724
I know that I was the one
who ruined things.

19:29.693 --> 19:33.864
My career,
and this bloody case.

19:35.166 --> 19:38.069
I've changed.

19:38.071 --> 19:39.771
This is our chance

19:39.773 --> 19:42.073
to make things right...

19:42.075 --> 19:43.942
So much better than we were.

19:43.944 --> 19:47.012
I've heard this
summation before.

19:47.014 --> 19:49.848
Helen, look at you.

19:51.150 --> 19:53.251
You're exhausted.

19:53.253 --> 19:55.988
Alone...

19:58.557 --> 20:00.559
Is this better
than the life I'm offering?

20:01.995 --> 20:03.695
What you're offering
isn't right, either.

20:04.964 --> 20:06.197
Nothing's right!

20:06.199 --> 20:08.634
I-I-I want to be left alone!

20:08.636 --> 20:10.335
I don't want any responsibility,

20:10.337 --> 20:13.138
no people clawing at me,
demanding my attention,

20:13.140 --> 20:16.909
no life or death situations!

20:24.051 --> 20:25.919
Do you love me?

20:31.860 --> 20:34.327
I did once,

20:34.329 --> 20:36.863
but it's not that simple
anymore, is it?

20:38.598 --> 20:41.233
I am offering you
a life without boundaries.

20:41.235 --> 20:44.770
We can go anywhere,

20:44.772 --> 20:47.372
be anyone.

20:48.741 --> 20:53.078
Anything.

20:53.080 --> 20:57.015
I'll give you
anything,

20:57.017 --> 20:58.717
just not a divorce.

21:18.106 --> 21:20.641
You need to choose
your true happiness.

21:49.001 --> 21:50.335
Damn.

22:10.394 --> 22:11.960
Will, no!

22:12.438 --> 22:14.072
What are you doing to us?

22:14.074 --> 22:15.139
Hold him down.

22:15.141 --> 22:16.207
Keep resisting
like this, Sporto,

22:16.209 --> 22:17.908
you're going to die!

22:17.910 --> 22:20.177
Get-get--
sedate him!

22:31.824 --> 22:35.226
Honey?

22:35.228 --> 22:38.397
Oh, my God,
were you asleep?

22:38.399 --> 22:41.366
I-I was having
that dream again.

22:41.368 --> 22:43.502
God... what is
wrong with me?

22:43.504 --> 22:46.037
Okay, well,
it's just a dream.

22:46.039 --> 22:47.205
It's just a dream, hon.

22:49.275 --> 22:50.909
Why does it feel so real?

22:50.911 --> 22:52.277
Maybe why don't you
tell me about them?

22:52.279 --> 22:54.913
Yeah...

22:54.915 --> 22:56.481
It was in some sort of a lab.

22:56.483 --> 22:58.283
Okay, so a lab,

22:58.285 --> 23:01.052
like an operating
theater, maybe?

23:01.054 --> 23:03.454
No, it was...

23:03.456 --> 23:08.193
It was like a research lab,

23:08.195 --> 23:11.329
and I-I wasn't alone.

23:13.499 --> 23:15.901
Okay, who else was there?

23:18.305 --> 23:20.239
Helen...

23:20.241 --> 23:22.775
Helen from
across the street?

23:22.777 --> 23:24.010
Okay, Will,

23:24.012 --> 23:27.146
this is--this is
all about the surgery.

23:27.148 --> 23:29.381
Your subconscious is--

23:29.383 --> 23:33.819
I can't-I can't remember
the most basic things, Abby.

23:33.821 --> 23:36.188
Like, about bypass surgery,

23:36.190 --> 23:39.790
about the hospital,
or-or the patient's name.

23:39.792 --> 23:40.925
Okay, Will, Will,

23:40.927 --> 23:43.427
you just need more sleep.

23:43.429 --> 23:45.929
You've been
restless

23:45.931 --> 23:49.133
the past
couple of nights.

23:49.135 --> 23:50.568
Okay?

23:57.308 --> 23:58.976
Do you remember our honeymoon?

24:02.113 --> 24:05.416
Yeah, of course I do.

24:05.418 --> 24:07.451
You don't?

24:12.156 --> 24:14.390
I've got to get some air,
I think.

25:32.973 --> 25:34.973
She's awake!

25:34.975 --> 25:35.907
Mr. St. Pierre!

25:37.476 --> 25:40.145
Now, just where
do you think you're going, hmm?

25:42.548 --> 25:43.948
This better be good!

25:43.950 --> 25:45.617
I was watching smackdown.

25:45.619 --> 25:47.486
Whoa!

25:47.488 --> 25:49.621
Magnus,
you crazy broad.

25:49.623 --> 25:51.556
You actually trying to
beat the house on this one?

25:51.558 --> 25:52.590
You'll lose.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.393
You...

25:55.395 --> 25:56.194
So, what
do we do now?

25:56.196 --> 25:57.428
We up the meds
is what we do.

25:57.430 --> 25:58.529
Bring her
back on side.

25:58.531 --> 25:59.764
Now would be a good time!

25:59.766 --> 26:00.631
Her dosage is already in
the red, Mr. St. Pierre.

26:00.633 --> 26:02.466
Oh, I'm sorry,

26:02.468 --> 26:03.668
are you in charge here?

26:03.670 --> 26:06.238
I don't see you paying
for all this tech.

26:06.240 --> 26:07.339
It's my job to tell you
you could kill her.

26:07.341 --> 26:09.474
There's no going
backwards on this.

26:09.476 --> 26:12.411
If this doesn't work out,
we may all soon be dead.

26:12.413 --> 26:15.481
Up the meds.

26:15.483 --> 26:17.183
Yes, sir.

26:19.153 --> 26:20.186
No--

26:23.291 --> 26:25.625
You're not going to win this
your way, Magnus.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.651
Um...

26:49.820 --> 26:53.622
What is all this?

26:53.624 --> 26:55.323
It's just, it's stuff.

26:55.325 --> 26:58.426
I'm just... trying
to sort through it.

26:58.428 --> 27:00.228
"Stuff"?

27:00.230 --> 27:02.363
Yeah, it's like
a puzzle, see?

27:02.365 --> 27:04.999
Look at this.
Isn't that cool?

27:05.001 --> 27:07.701
Um, I thought-I thought
today was the pre-consult

27:07.703 --> 27:09.336
for the surgery,

27:09.338 --> 27:12.373
with the Chief of Staff
from the hospital?

27:12.375 --> 27:14.442
I canceled it.

27:14.444 --> 27:17.311
The pre-consult?

27:17.313 --> 27:18.579
The surgery.

27:18.581 --> 27:20.247
I'm out.

27:20.249 --> 27:22.382
It-it's not worth it, you know?

27:22.384 --> 27:25.286
It's too much stress.

27:25.288 --> 27:27.688
Okay, um...

27:27.690 --> 27:29.524
Yeah...

27:29.526 --> 27:32.561
A-and so these
are all hers?

27:32.563 --> 27:34.362
Helen's?

27:34.364 --> 27:35.731
Yeah.

27:35.733 --> 27:38.067
She was throwing them out,
so I just... you know.

27:38.069 --> 27:39.435
Okay, Will...

27:39.437 --> 27:41.805
Uh, Will,
what is going on?

27:41.807 --> 27:44.241
Why-why are you
doing this?

27:44.243 --> 27:46.142
Abby, do you see
this pattern here?

27:46.144 --> 27:47.243
Do you see it?

27:47.245 --> 27:49.312
This pattern
means something to me,

27:49.314 --> 27:51.047
and if I can just
figure it out, then I could--

27:51.049 --> 27:54.317
okay, Will, Will,
Will, you're having

27:54.319 --> 27:55.685
some sort of
breakdown,

27:56.855 --> 27:58.254
I'm going to
call a doctor.

27:58.256 --> 28:00.256
No, no, no, hold on a second,
hold on a second.

28:00.258 --> 28:01.624
I swear I'm fine.

28:01.626 --> 28:03.060
I just...

28:04.195 --> 28:05.729
Okay, then,

28:05.731 --> 28:06.797
talk to me.

28:06.799 --> 28:08.599
Please.

28:10.603 --> 28:13.237
I love you.

28:17.609 --> 28:18.676
Everything's changed.

28:20.646 --> 28:22.580
These dreams that
I've been having,

28:22.582 --> 28:23.881
about being a prisoner,

28:23.883 --> 28:25.082
they mean something.

28:25.084 --> 28:26.517
Like...

28:26.519 --> 28:28.252
I don't know. It's...

28:29.822 --> 28:33.324
This life feels wrong,

28:33.326 --> 28:35.126
it feels like...

28:35.128 --> 28:36.594
Like I don't belong here.

28:39.598 --> 28:42.500
"Don't-don't belong here."

28:44.704 --> 28:46.504
I can't believe this.

28:46.506 --> 28:48.506
I-I...

28:48.508 --> 28:50.274
I don't know
why I didn't see it.

28:50.276 --> 28:52.109
I have been so blind!

28:52.111 --> 28:53.411
Abby, hold on a second.

28:55.314 --> 28:56.314
Where are you going?

28:56.316 --> 28:57.416
What do you care, Will?

28:57.418 --> 28:59.185
This isn't the life
that you want!

28:59.187 --> 29:00.520
You know, I just wish
you had the guts to say it

29:00.522 --> 29:01.687
instead playing crazy

29:01.689 --> 29:03.723
because you are trying
to protect my feelings!

29:03.725 --> 29:05.459
That is not true.

29:05.461 --> 29:06.660
I have heard of
this before.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.829
Men who conveniently
lose their minds

29:08.831 --> 29:10.497
before the baby comes,
abandoning their wives,

29:10.499 --> 29:11.598
exactly what
you are doing!

29:11.600 --> 29:12.532
I am not
abandoning anyone--

29:12.534 --> 29:13.733
Yes, you are!

29:13.735 --> 29:14.868
Because you are
terrified of this,

29:14.870 --> 29:16.303
of all this
responsibility!

29:16.305 --> 29:17.671
Listen to me,
I love you, okay?

29:17.673 --> 29:18.538
I know--

29:18.540 --> 29:20.641
No, Will, this is real.

29:20.643 --> 29:22.809
I am real!

29:25.813 --> 29:26.746
I-I know.

29:26.748 --> 29:28.214
I-I know that you're real-

29:28.216 --> 29:29.649
then why are you pushing away?

29:29.651 --> 29:30.717
Why are you push--

29:33.888 --> 29:34.888
Will...

29:34.890 --> 29:35.822
What's the matter?

29:35.824 --> 29:37.423
Will, I don't...

29:37.425 --> 29:39.191
Are you okay?
What's the matter?

29:39.193 --> 29:40.293
What's the matter?

29:40.295 --> 29:42.495
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God...

29:42.497 --> 29:44.564
Will!

29:44.566 --> 29:45.731
God, Will!

29:45.733 --> 29:47.767
Just hold on.

29:47.769 --> 29:50.470
Yes, uh, my name
is Will Zimmerman,

29:50.472 --> 29:51.738
I live at 5621
Whyte Plains Road.

29:51.740 --> 29:54.174
I need an ambulance.

29:54.176 --> 29:55.175
My wife has collapsed.

29:55.177 --> 29:56.009
She's eight months pregnant!

29:56.011 --> 29:56.977
Dear lord...

29:56.979 --> 29:57.778
Hurry!

29:58.848 --> 29:59.847
Okay, okay...

29:59.849 --> 30:00.915
Abby, where's the pain?

30:00.917 --> 30:02.717
What happened?

30:02.719 --> 30:03.784
We were just talking,

30:03.786 --> 30:04.919
and then she almost
passed out,

30:04.921 --> 30:06.420
and then
she started shaking.

30:06.422 --> 30:08.255
Do you have
a medical kit?

30:08.257 --> 30:09.389
Yeah, it's in my car.

30:09.391 --> 30:10.524
Good, get it.

30:10.526 --> 30:11.525
Ambulance?

30:11.527 --> 30:12.759
It's on its way.

30:12.761 --> 30:15.362
All right,
deep breaths, Abby.

30:16.497 --> 30:17.730
How's your vision?

30:17.732 --> 30:18.598
Blurry.

30:18.600 --> 30:19.766
Is the baby...

30:19.768 --> 30:21.368
Baby's going to be
perfectly fine,

30:21.370 --> 30:22.402
I promise you.

30:22.404 --> 30:23.336
Okay.

30:23.338 --> 30:24.870
What's wrong with her?

30:24.872 --> 30:27.406
I'll wager
late onset preecclampsia,

30:27.408 --> 30:28.640
likely caused by hypertension.

30:28.642 --> 30:30.341
Good thing you
caught it in time.

30:32.778 --> 30:34.512
Thank you.

30:34.514 --> 30:35.879
You're very welcome.

31:09.570 --> 31:10.804
How's Abby?

31:10.806 --> 31:13.306
She's on the mend.

31:13.308 --> 31:14.907
You were dead on, by the way.

31:14.909 --> 31:16.442
Preecclampsia.

31:16.444 --> 31:17.576
Hypertension.

31:17.578 --> 31:20.813
She's in bed, trying
to get some sleep.

31:20.815 --> 31:21.848
Glad to hear it.

31:26.587 --> 31:27.520
Coffee?

31:28.822 --> 31:30.290
Do you have any tea?

31:31.859 --> 31:32.892
I think I'll join you.

31:32.894 --> 31:34.327
Far more civilized.

31:34.329 --> 31:36.964
I don't even know
why I bother making coffee.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.006
What the hell's going on?

31:47.675 --> 31:50.844
I was hoping
you could tell me.

31:52.446 --> 31:54.547
Are you happy?

31:54.549 --> 31:56.449
Here? This?

31:57.484 --> 32:00.619
You know,
I hate the term "happy",

32:00.621 --> 32:02.454
like it's the be-all,
end-all of life.

32:02.456 --> 32:04.056
Like if we don't achieve
perfect happiness,

32:04.058 --> 32:06.092
we've somehow failed.

32:06.094 --> 32:07.326
I got married

32:07.328 --> 32:08.361
because it was supposed
to make me happy,

32:08.363 --> 32:09.828
safe.

32:09.830 --> 32:11.497
But it didn't.

32:13.067 --> 32:14.868
It should have.

32:14.870 --> 32:16.603
John was everything I wanted,

32:16.605 --> 32:17.637
or so I thought.

32:18.973 --> 32:20.040
And what about kids?

32:21.943 --> 32:23.344
We never had any.

32:33.587 --> 32:35.521
Why are you here,
Dr. Zimmerman?

32:37.123 --> 32:39.858
Because I need to...

32:39.860 --> 32:41.526
figure out why my life
is falling apart.

32:41.528 --> 32:43.394
I'm not the psychiatrist.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.699
You see?
Right there.

32:47.701 --> 32:48.800
Why did you say that?

32:48.802 --> 32:51.069
Why, is it important
that I did?

32:51.071 --> 32:53.372
Because it just is, Magnus.

32:55.408 --> 32:56.442
What did you call me?

32:59.580 --> 33:01.782
Magnus.

33:01.784 --> 33:04.718
That's my maiden name.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.053
I haven't used it in decades.

33:06.055 --> 33:08.055
How on earth would you know it?

33:13.160 --> 33:15.062
Okay...

33:15.064 --> 33:16.696
Hear me out,

33:16.698 --> 33:18.831
and-and this <i> will</i> sound crazy.

33:24.905 --> 33:27.673
But I think...
That none of this--

33:27.675 --> 33:28.674
is real.

33:29.809 --> 33:30.709
Our lives--

33:30.711 --> 33:31.677
feel completely wrong.

33:31.679 --> 33:33.545
I married a man I hate.

33:34.814 --> 33:36.548
I-I drink coffee,
for God's sake.

33:36.550 --> 33:37.983
I'm a cardiologist.

33:37.985 --> 33:39.685
I might as well be a left-hander
for the Blue Jays.

33:39.687 --> 33:41.754
I couldn't even begin
to diagnose Abby today.

33:41.756 --> 33:44.123
And yet I could,
in a heartbeat.

33:47.561 --> 33:49.161
I don't
remember marrying her.

33:49.163 --> 33:52.832
I sit here cooped up all night
painting?

33:56.170 --> 33:57.738
I need to show you something.

33:59.941 --> 34:01.976
It's across
five paintings.

34:01.978 --> 34:04.579
One pattern.

34:04.581 --> 34:07.048
I never saw it
that way before.

34:07.050 --> 34:09.016
What do you think
it means?

34:09.018 --> 34:10.117
I don't know,

34:10.119 --> 34:12.453
but somehow
it feels real.

34:12.455 --> 34:14.121
Like you've seen it before.

34:16.958 --> 34:18.793
I've been having
these nightmares,

34:18.795 --> 34:21.462
about...

34:21.464 --> 34:23.531
Being experimented on.

34:23.533 --> 34:24.532
In a laboratory of some kind?

34:27.103 --> 34:28.168
We're having the same dreams.

34:28.170 --> 34:31.072
How is that
even possible?

34:31.074 --> 34:32.474
What...

34:32.476 --> 34:34.609
What does this pattern
have to do with it?

34:36.812 --> 34:39.214
What if we're not really here?

34:39.216 --> 34:41.917
We're there,

34:41.918 --> 34:43.150
and this, all of this,

34:43.152 --> 34:44.886
is just a construct,

34:44.888 --> 34:46.286
it's a prison.

34:46.289 --> 34:48.989
Our dreams are
actually our reality,

34:48.992 --> 34:49.824
and this--

34:49.826 --> 34:50.659
Is all a dream.

34:50.661 --> 34:51.960
Yes.

34:53.529 --> 34:54.696
For what reason?

34:56.266 --> 34:58.701
I don't know.

34:58.703 --> 34:59.968
But I know that this isn't me,

34:59.970 --> 35:02.137
and from
what you said,

35:02.139 --> 35:04.206
this isn't you.

35:04.208 --> 35:06.041
We're not crazy.

35:12.149 --> 35:13.183
What do we do?

35:45.052 --> 35:47.620
How are thing one and thing two
doing today?

35:47.622 --> 35:48.954
Hmm?

35:53.026 --> 35:54.960
I just wish
you would stop fighting it.

35:54.962 --> 35:56.194
You'd best behave.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.774
"Wish you'd both
stop fighting it?"

36:08.776 --> 36:09.808
"Thing one, thing two?"

36:09.810 --> 36:12.678
Aw, bloody hell, it's real.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.213
Yeah.

36:14.215 --> 36:15.982
All right, how do we get out?

36:17.317 --> 36:18.651
Well, you said

36:18.653 --> 36:21.054
that you'd actually escaped
briefly before.

36:21.056 --> 36:24.157
It felt like I did,

36:24.159 --> 36:25.992
and-and then I woke up here,

36:25.994 --> 36:27.294
and things got more intense
with Abby.

36:27.296 --> 36:29.263
Same here.

36:29.265 --> 36:30.865
In my... dream,

36:30.867 --> 36:33.067
I became aware of
my surroundings.

36:33.069 --> 36:36.338
John suddenly shows up
professing his love for me,

36:36.340 --> 36:37.907
pulling me further
into this world.

36:37.909 --> 36:39.141
So whenever we try to get out,

36:39.143 --> 36:40.676
something here
tries to make us stay.

36:40.678 --> 36:43.012
I think that
in order to escape,

36:43.014 --> 36:45.047
we have to completely
reject this life.

36:50.287 --> 36:52.789
Think about it.

36:52.791 --> 36:55.092
We've tried distancing ourselves
emotionally from people.

36:55.094 --> 36:57.761
Your fight with Abby,
my rejection of John.

36:57.763 --> 36:58.795
It didn't work, did it?

36:58.797 --> 37:00.898
We both got tossed back in here.

37:00.900 --> 37:02.933
Okay, but suicide?
I mean...

37:02.935 --> 37:04.802
How do we know for sure

37:04.804 --> 37:08.039
which one of these
realities is real?

37:08.041 --> 37:11.776
Beyond bad dreams
and a gut feeling?

37:11.778 --> 37:16.114
I guess, like everything,
it's a leap of faith.

37:21.719 --> 37:23.554
You drive.

37:32.565 --> 37:33.931
Where are you going?

37:36.569 --> 37:37.535
Stop the car.

37:37.537 --> 37:38.369
Will!

37:38.371 --> 37:39.537
Abby, I'm
so sorry--

37:39.539 --> 37:40.371
I want to talk to you.

37:40.373 --> 37:41.339
Will, what's going on?

37:41.341 --> 37:42.373
Open the door.

37:42.375 --> 37:44.909
Will. Will, look at me.
Look at me.

37:44.911 --> 37:46.210
Open the door.

37:46.212 --> 37:47.378
Will, what's going on?

37:47.380 --> 37:48.279
Please, just
for a moment.

37:48.281 --> 37:49.546
Just get out of
the car, please.

37:49.548 --> 37:50.914
- Open the door.
- Please, hon!

37:50.916 --> 37:52.650
Open the bloody door!

37:52.652 --> 37:53.551
Go, go, go!

38:07.564 --> 38:08.965
Are you ready?

38:10.534 --> 38:12.702
I've been here before.

38:33.685 --> 38:34.550
Whoa!

38:34.552 --> 38:35.485
Will...

38:35.487 --> 38:36.586
Wow.

38:36.588 --> 38:38.254
Well, that was
interesting.

38:38.256 --> 38:40.490
Let's get out of here.

38:43.060 --> 38:44.827
They're up.

38:44.829 --> 38:46.228
Not good.

38:46.230 --> 38:47.162
The neural cortex
hasn't finished sequencing--

38:47.164 --> 38:49.631
I get it,
I get it.

38:49.633 --> 38:50.999
How are you two feeling?

38:51.001 --> 38:52.033
Do you know
who you are?

38:52.035 --> 38:54.069
Virgil St. Pierre.

38:54.071 --> 38:55.837
I should have known
you were behind this.

38:55.839 --> 38:57.539
Yeah, I think
they're fine now.

38:57.541 --> 38:59.908
Yes, Magnus,
I'm involved here,

38:59.910 --> 39:01.777
and if I'd known
what a giant headache

39:01.779 --> 39:02.878
you two would be,

39:02.880 --> 39:04.046
I would have never
taken the gig.

39:04.048 --> 39:05.214
What's with the tanks,

39:05.216 --> 39:06.516
and how long
have we been here?

39:06.518 --> 39:08.184
Three days, big shot,

39:08.186 --> 39:10.520
eight hours,
and 26 minutes.

39:10.522 --> 39:11.354
What?

39:11.356 --> 39:13.190
You think
this is fun for us?

39:13.192 --> 39:14.091
Who brought us here?

39:14.093 --> 39:16.093
We did, doc.

39:16.095 --> 39:17.260
Henry...

39:17.262 --> 39:19.996
Mainly to save
your lives.

39:19.998 --> 39:21.898
Glad to see you two
up and around,

39:21.900 --> 39:23.767
and by the looks
of things, sane?

39:23.769 --> 39:24.668
Yes.

39:24.670 --> 39:26.102
Oh! You see?

39:26.104 --> 39:27.837
Sane! Ooh...

39:27.839 --> 39:28.972
You're welcome.

39:31.108 --> 39:32.642
Sorry
about the mess.

39:32.644 --> 39:35.111
We've been living
like bachelors.

39:35.113 --> 39:36.046
Which we are,

39:36.048 --> 39:37.681
which is sad.

39:37.683 --> 39:38.849
Where are we?

39:38.851 --> 39:40.217
We are in a private
research facility

39:40.219 --> 39:41.885
underneath
the New Mexican desert.

39:41.887 --> 39:43.621
Hundred miles
south of Santa fe.

39:43.623 --> 39:44.989
How did we
get here?

39:44.991 --> 39:46.124
Seems you bigshots
got yourself

39:46.126 --> 39:47.325
in a little trouble.

39:47.327 --> 39:49.895
These two needed a favor...

39:49.897 --> 39:51.896
From you?

39:51.898 --> 39:53.265
You put her
in a bat suit last time.

39:53.267 --> 39:55.133
Exactly.
He owed me.

39:56.135 --> 39:57.369
There was
a price tag.

39:57.371 --> 39:58.870
My joint, my lab.

39:58.872 --> 40:00.972
Everything is for rent
these days.

40:00.974 --> 40:01.940
Okay, hold on
a second,

40:01.942 --> 40:03.241
we paid to be
held prisoner?

40:03.243 --> 40:04.910
Prisoner?

40:04.912 --> 40:06.745
No, you needed
treatment.

40:06.747 --> 40:07.979
You guys don't
remember anything

40:07.981 --> 40:09.114
from before?

40:09.116 --> 40:10.249
Juarez?

40:10.251 --> 40:12.584
South of
the Mexican border?

40:12.586 --> 40:13.852
Wow.

40:13.854 --> 40:15.254
No wonder you guys
are confused.

40:15.256 --> 40:16.321
Okay, so...

40:16.323 --> 40:17.456
We got called to a situation

40:17.458 --> 40:18.791
from those U.N.
Lotus defense guys.

40:18.793 --> 40:20.092
The international
security force

40:20.094 --> 40:21.760
we encountered outside Carentan.

40:21.762 --> 40:22.895
Yes, something big

40:22.897 --> 40:24.363
was coming up out of the ground
near the city.

40:24.365 --> 40:25.631
Now, at first

40:25.633 --> 40:26.765
you thought it was
an off-season migration

40:26.767 --> 40:28.267
of rock lizards,

40:28.269 --> 40:31.270
but then
you got hit by this.

40:39.245 --> 40:41.947
What on earth is it?

40:41.949 --> 40:42.982
We don't
really know.

40:42.984 --> 40:44.116
I've just been calling it
a psych-worm.

40:44.118 --> 40:46.084
It surfaced
right underneath you,

40:46.086 --> 40:47.052
and hit you with

40:47.054 --> 40:48.754
some kind of
psychoactive venom,

40:48.756 --> 40:49.989
which apparently
puts its victims

40:49.991 --> 40:51.624
into a crazy dream world...

40:51.626 --> 40:53.893
While it devours you.

40:53.895 --> 40:56.195
Amazing creature.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.333
Those markings...

41:00.335 --> 41:02.335
Exactly.

41:02.337 --> 41:05.371
Not crazy.

41:05.373 --> 41:08.341
So you did all this
to save our minds?

41:08.343 --> 41:09.575
Yeah.

41:09.577 --> 41:11.143
We captured the creature,
but then you two were...

41:11.145 --> 41:12.078
Gone.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.245
Blitzed.

41:13.247 --> 41:14.780
Whacked out, loco--

41:14.782 --> 41:16.215
We got it.

41:16.217 --> 41:17.884
So those tanks that
we were lying in--

41:17.886 --> 41:19.719
May I?

41:19.721 --> 41:20.954
Thanks.

41:20.956 --> 41:22.990
As I said, it's my lab.

41:22.992 --> 41:24.658
My team, along with

41:24.660 --> 41:27.194
Mr. "Ooh, I hate losing
at the video games" here,

41:27.196 --> 41:28.863
combined a neuroactive
mind-control gel

41:28.865 --> 41:29.964
that I'm developing...

41:29.966 --> 41:31.933
Right, but the chemical
was siphoned

41:31.935 --> 41:33.935
from the worm's
salivary glands, which...

41:35.739 --> 41:37.106
And we came up with a treatment
to restore your minds.

41:37.108 --> 41:39.141
You see,
the neural gel

41:39.143 --> 41:40.910
was your reality
lifeline

41:40.912 --> 41:44.446
from the crazy dreamworld
that the worm had implanted.

41:44.448 --> 41:47.081
So, every time
we saw the lab...

41:47.083 --> 41:48.883
It would be like
a patient waking up

41:48.885 --> 41:49.850
in the middle of surgery.

41:49.852 --> 41:52.386
Right, see,
the timing was tricky,

41:52.388 --> 41:54.155
'cause if you
came out too soon,

41:54.157 --> 41:56.290
there'd be damage
to your minds,

41:56.292 --> 41:57.892
so we had to keep
putting you back in

41:57.894 --> 41:59.761
until the scans showed
normal brain activity.

42:01.097 --> 42:02.831
I guess you guys really
don't like living in bliss.

42:02.833 --> 42:05.401
Okay, but why
bring us here?

42:05.403 --> 42:07.036
I mean, why not just
bring us to the Sanctuary?

42:07.038 --> 42:08.137
Clock was ticking

42:08.139 --> 42:09.805
from the second
you guys got hit, dude.

42:09.807 --> 42:11.507
If the venom was active
in your system too long,

42:11.509 --> 42:12.909
there was less chance
that we could save you.

42:12.911 --> 42:14.043
He made a call.

42:14.045 --> 42:15.312
I opened my doors to friends.

42:15.314 --> 42:17.747
Yeah, that was really
sweet of you, Virgil.

42:17.749 --> 42:19.215
Bygones, Sporto,
bygones.

42:19.217 --> 42:20.283
I got a big heart.

42:20.285 --> 42:21.217
Until we get the bill.

42:21.219 --> 42:22.919
What can I say?

42:22.921 --> 42:25.155
Sanity ain't cheap.

42:25.157 --> 42:27.290
I-I've never even
heard of this creature.

42:27.292 --> 42:29.392
How is it possible
that something this large,

42:29.394 --> 42:30.793
with this unique ability,

42:30.795 --> 42:31.761
could go unnoticed?

42:33.731 --> 42:34.797
The only explanation

42:34.799 --> 42:36.899
is that it came from
Hollow Earth.

42:38.235 --> 42:40.169
It caught us completely
by surprise, doc.

42:40.171 --> 42:42.072
We're getting reports
from Sanctuaries worldwide.

42:42.074 --> 42:44.741
We are on a full
global alert.

42:44.743 --> 42:46.143
Well, then,
we have to head home.

42:46.168 --> 42:50.168
