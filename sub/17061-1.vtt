04:29.479 --> 04:31.314
Today, the boy is dead.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.316
And in his place

04:40.156 --> 04:41.616
is a man.

05:44.679 --> 05:46.055
Here you go.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.935
Training in 60 minutes.

07:18.648 --> 07:20.483
Where's the boning knife?

07:21.526 --> 07:22.527
Dad?

07:23.194 --> 07:25.988
Zaja took the boning knife again.

07:38.084 --> 07:39.168
Oh, yeah.

07:44.674 --> 07:46.175
Oh, Jesus.

07:49.929 --> 07:50.930
Pol Pot.

07:52.140 --> 07:53.182
Yeah.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.143
Boning knife.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.271
Mountain beaver, huh?

07:58.688 --> 07:59.856
Mmm-hmm.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.001
You're dead.

08:21.419 --> 08:23.713
Vespyr, Kielyr, pair off.

08:25.715 --> 08:26.757
Get your guard up.

08:27.383 --> 08:28.718
You have to stab to kill.

08:28.843 --> 08:32.138
Aim for the liver or the kidneys,
otherwise she'll never learn.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.264
Shouldn't we aim here?

08:33.347 --> 08:35.349
A knife in the lungs
creates a pneumothorax.

08:35.850 --> 08:38.186
Or next to the sternum,
to penetrate the heart?

08:38.394 --> 08:39.895
That'd be instant death.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.773
If it makes you happy, Zaj, sure.
Aim for the heart.

08:43.399 --> 08:44.859
- Bo, you want to show 'em?
- Over here.

08:45.526 --> 08:46.944
Okay, let's go.

08:47.403 --> 08:48.946
Disarm her if you can.

08:54.076 --> 08:55.912
Ow!

08:55.995 --> 08:57.163
Good.

08:57.413 --> 08:59.332
How is that good? She just stabbed me.

08:59.457 --> 09:01.459
She fucking just stabbed me.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.044
Well, then learn to defend yourself.

09:04.253 --> 09:05.254
- You kill her.
- Yeah, thank you.

09:05.421 --> 09:06.547
Let's try that.

09:42.083 --> 09:44.085
Zaj, page.

09:44.919 --> 09:46.754
Three hundred and ninety-eight.

09:47.255 --> 09:49.632
- You still liking it?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:49.924 --> 09:51.425
To stay on schedule for the test,

09:51.509 --> 09:54.303
you're going to have to be
finished in eight days. Okay?

09:55.012 --> 09:56.264
Okay.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.978
Vesp? How you getting along?

10:02.353 --> 10:06.274
I just finished Chapter 12,
"The World on a String."

10:08.818 --> 10:10.319
What?

10:10.695 --> 10:13.447
Are you having any trouble
with quantum entanglement?

10:13.948 --> 10:16.325
Planck length versus Planck time?

10:18.286 --> 10:19.996
- I'm fine.
- Good.

10:20.121 --> 10:23.416
Then tomorrow after lunch, you can
give a brief presentation on M-theory.

10:23.541 --> 10:27.003
Argue counterpoints with Bo and Rell
vis-Ã -vis Witten and Dirac.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.152
Whoo!

13:06.912 --> 13:09.582
Go. Go all the way to the top.

13:17.256 --> 13:20.050
If training is over today, can we
take Steve somewhere for class later?

13:20.134 --> 13:21.177
Maybe.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.846
Why does Mommy have to be gone so long?

13:26.599 --> 13:27.725
She hasn't been gone very long.

13:27.808 --> 13:32.354
Actually, it's been three months,
two weeks, six days, and 11 hours.

13:32.438 --> 13:33.481
Mom is very ill.

13:33.564 --> 13:35.065
Don't talk to us like
we're your inferiors.

13:35.149 --> 13:37.902
Bo is right. Mom needs
to be in the hospital right now.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.904
But you said hospitals
are only a great place to go

13:39.987 --> 13:41.530
if you're a healthy person
and you want to die.

13:41.614 --> 13:44.909
You said Americans are undereducated
and over medicated.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.161
You said the AMA are avaricious whores

13:47.244 --> 13:49.413
only too willing to spread
their fat legs for Big Pharma.

13:49.497 --> 13:51.415
All of those things are true.

13:51.499 --> 13:54.710
But Mom does not have enough
of the neurotransmitter serotonin

13:54.793 --> 13:56.879
to conduct electrical
signals in her brain.

13:56.962 --> 13:59.548
Exactly when is Mom coming back?

14:01.133 --> 14:03.052
That's what I'm going to go find out.

14:04.595 --> 14:05.679
Be good, monkey butts.

14:05.763 --> 14:06.764
See you later, Dad.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.307
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

14:53.936 --> 14:54.937
Sorry.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.941
Are you coming in?

15:02.653 --> 15:04.321
No? Okay. Bye.

15:11.704 --> 15:13.831
Here, Bo, I got that. Go talk to them.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.457
We got time.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.835
Ask her what she thinks
of the working people

15:17.918 --> 15:20.296
creating an armed revolution
against the exploiting classes

15:20.379 --> 15:21.714
and their state structures?

15:21.797 --> 15:24.466
Well, Marxists can be just
as genocidal as capitalists.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.385
Or whether or not she's
a dialectical materialist

15:26.468 --> 15:28.137
and accords primacy to the class struggle?

15:28.220 --> 15:29.388
Avoid Marxism.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.307
Or telling her you're a Trotskyite.

15:31.390 --> 15:32.891
Trotskyist.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.686
Only a Stalinist would call
a Trotskyist a Trotskyite.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.147
And I'm not a Trotskyist anymore.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.398
I'm a Maoist.

15:40.858 --> 15:41.859
Right.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.404
I forgot, sorry.

15:47.990 --> 15:48.991
Hey.

15:49.825 --> 15:51.035
Hey, Joe.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.078
I sold all your stuff from last time.

15:53.162 --> 15:54.413
- Great.
- Let's see what you got.

16:38.123 --> 16:40.000
- Hello?
- Hey.

16:40.084 --> 16:41.877
- Ben.
- How's she doing?

16:49.760 --> 16:51.178
Harper?

16:53.389 --> 16:54.807
Harper?

16:55.641 --> 16:57.226
Leslie killed herself last night.

17:04.358 --> 17:05.608
How?

17:07.903 --> 17:09.029
Harper.

17:09.738 --> 17:12.031
Harper, tell me.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.122
She slit her wrists.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.712
You're my brother.
If you need anything from me...

18:21.477 --> 18:22.936
Last night,

18:24.480 --> 18:26.315
Mommy killed herself.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.319
She finally did it.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.577
Your mother is dead.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.838
Nothing is going to change.

18:52.341 --> 18:55.511
We will go on living
in exactly the same way.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.057
We're a family.

19:00.933 --> 19:01.934
No.

19:02.017 --> 19:03.018
Mom!

19:23.705 --> 19:26.083
Mom! Mom!

19:26.625 --> 19:29.044
Fuck you! Fucking...

19:30.420 --> 19:32.214
Mom! Mom!

19:32.923 --> 19:34.216
I hate you!

19:34.299 --> 19:35.592
Fuck!

19:58.782 --> 19:59.992
Daddy.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.279
Jesus fucking Christ.

21:09.269 --> 21:12.022
- Forty-three.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

21:12.147 --> 21:13.315
Forty-four.

21:14.316 --> 21:15.359
Forty-five.

21:18.195 --> 21:19.446
Hold plank.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.158
Like boards.

21:23.951 --> 21:25.661
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe.

21:26.244 --> 21:27.245
You got it.

21:29.164 --> 21:30.540
Keep holding.

21:30.666 --> 21:32.250
You're strong, you can do it.

21:34.378 --> 21:36.630
Dad, when's Mom's funeral?

21:39.841 --> 21:41.551
The utter recklessness,

21:41.635 --> 21:45.055
the instability and insecurity
that you have brought to her life...

21:45.138 --> 21:47.683
We decided to live here. Both of us.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.601
This is your fault.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.854
Leslie had a disease.

21:52.938 --> 21:54.064
She had to be in a good facility.

21:54.147 --> 21:57.567
You were kind enough to offer to pay
for it as long as she was treated near you.

21:57.651 --> 21:58.694
We did that.

21:59.277 --> 22:00.570
I found her will.

22:00.654 --> 22:03.407
I assume you know
that Leslie was a Buddhist.

22:03.699 --> 22:06.994
That means she wanted to be
cremated, not buried.

22:07.619 --> 22:08.870
It was very important to her...

22:08.954 --> 22:10.789
I have just lost my only child.

22:10.872 --> 22:14.418
I'm in no mood to discuss the particulars
of her funeral with you.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.545
Wherever you are, stay there!

22:16.628 --> 22:18.171
You are not welcome here.

22:18.255 --> 22:20.173
If you show up, I will have you arrested.

22:22.551 --> 22:25.512
Jack? God damn it.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.180
Hello, Ben.

22:27.556 --> 22:30.726
Leslie is in Heaven now.
She is finally at peace.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.353
When is the ceremony?

22:33.854 --> 22:37.733
It's in five days,
in New Mexico, at our church.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.317
How are the children?

22:39.401 --> 22:40.944
Did you hear what Jack just said?

22:41.028 --> 22:42.279
It's been years.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.699
He said that he would have me
arrested if we go there.

22:46.158 --> 22:47.284
Did you hear that?

22:47.367 --> 22:48.910
He's very upset.

22:50.495 --> 22:52.998
It's just best to do what he says.

23:01.006 --> 23:02.007
It doesn't make any sense.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.925
I mean, who are they
to make these decisions?

23:04.009 --> 23:07.387
It's this sick sense of entitlement
that they all seem to have.

23:07.471 --> 23:09.556
This is what we stand against,
this is what Mom stood against.

23:09.639 --> 23:10.849
Mom hated that world.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.018
Clothes on when we eat, please.

23:19.316 --> 23:20.817
It's completely unjust, that's what it is.

23:20.901 --> 23:23.779
We're in the very unique position
of hating those people.

23:23.862 --> 23:26.114
- Can "unique" be modified?
- No.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.410
We don't hate Nana and Grandpa,

23:30.786 --> 23:33.955
but the rest of their tribe
are fascist capitalists.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.916
You're just repeating whatever Dad says.

23:35.999 --> 23:40.087
I'm writing down everything
you say. In my mind.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.548
Do you even know what a fascist is?

23:43.632 --> 23:46.009
Violent, nationalist militants.

23:46.093 --> 23:50.138
Supported by big business and their
totalitarian single-party dictators.

23:52.808 --> 23:56.061
- We're her family, we have to go.
- Grandpa said we can't.

23:59.356 --> 24:01.066
What will happen if they arrest you?

24:05.445 --> 24:07.155
Will they take us away from you?

24:13.370 --> 24:14.371
That's a possibility.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.013
Hey.

24:33.807 --> 24:35.225
Wake up.

24:37.561 --> 24:42.566
Wake up, grizzly bear, my fantastic man.

24:54.411 --> 24:57.080
What we're doing out
here is so incredible.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.458
The kids are amazing.

25:04.462 --> 25:08.133
But you have to take care
of them for me, okay?

25:12.304 --> 25:14.639
I love you all so much.

25:17.434 --> 25:19.603
I love you so much.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.504
We want to see Mom.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.173
Plus, Grandpa can't oppress us.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.467
We want to honor her life.

25:50.967 --> 25:51.968
It's the least you could do.

25:53.220 --> 25:54.971
What's that supposed to mean?

25:56.681 --> 25:57.974
You know.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.019
No, I don't.

26:02.646 --> 26:05.232
Forget it. But I know.

26:05.357 --> 26:07.817
- We're strong and we're ready.
- I said no.

26:09.027 --> 26:10.195
Too risky.

26:10.278 --> 26:11.905
We're defined by our actions,
not our words.

26:12.530 --> 26:13.782
Dad, give us the mission.

26:13.865 --> 26:15.617
Mission: Rescue Mom!

26:16.117 --> 26:18.036
Training in 10 minutes.

26:46.856 --> 26:47.899
Oh, fuck!

26:49.234 --> 26:50.360
Rell?

26:51.194 --> 26:52.404
Can you flex your fingers?

26:54.572 --> 26:55.824
S-T-O-P.

26:56.199 --> 27:00.912
Stay calm. Think. Observe. And plan.

27:01.329 --> 27:04.582
If you hit the rocks below you,
you'll die from blunt force trauma.

27:05.709 --> 27:08.253
Or internal bleeding
from massive bone fracturing.

27:09.671 --> 27:12.007
Or splenic flexure of the large intestine.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.009
Yes, thank you, Zaj.

27:15.010 --> 27:16.761
I can't, my hand.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.346
There's no cavalry.

27:19.347 --> 27:22.600
No one will magically appear
and save you in the end.

27:34.446 --> 27:35.613
Almost.

27:38.366 --> 27:40.285
You got it. Good boy.

27:41.536 --> 27:43.038
All right, let's go.

28:26.081 --> 28:28.917
Class time on Steve.
We're going up to the glacier.

28:29.918 --> 28:31.169
Let's go.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.834
We can't go to Mommy's funeral.

29:11.251 --> 29:12.627
We have to do what we're told.

29:14.295 --> 29:17.090
Some fights, you can't win.

29:17.966 --> 29:20.635
The powerful control
the lives of the powerless.

29:22.262 --> 29:24.097
That's the way the world works.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.850
It's unjust and it's unfair.

29:27.642 --> 29:29.769
But that's just too damn bad.

29:30.937 --> 29:34.315
We have to shut up and accept it.

29:46.161 --> 29:47.495
Well, fuck that.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.006
So they know we're coming!

30:03.720 --> 30:08.183
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

30:52.727 --> 30:55.563
Attention all campers,
this is your captain speaking.

30:55.688 --> 30:58.775
Here we have the embodiment
of Calvin Coolidge's statement

30:58.900 --> 31:01.361
that the business of America is business.

31:01.444 --> 31:03.738
Our democracy is one of
the brightest lights

31:03.821 --> 31:07.242
of social justice
in the history of humankind.

31:07.617 --> 31:11.746
And yet most of our fellow citizens
engage in frenzied shopping

31:11.871 --> 31:14.123
as their primary form
of social interaction.

31:14.249 --> 31:16.876
"Come on down, let's go shopping!"

31:17.085 --> 31:18.795
"These prices are insane!"

31:38.940 --> 31:40.942
- What's a bordello? Oh.
- A whorehouse.

31:41.442 --> 31:42.569
What are you reading?

31:44.612 --> 31:47.115
Lolita? I didn't assign that book.

31:47.407 --> 31:48.950
I'm skipping ahead.

31:50.451 --> 31:51.786
And?

31:53.955 --> 31:55.373
- It's interesting.
- "Interesting!"

31:55.456 --> 31:56.457
Illegal word!

31:56.583 --> 31:58.626
Dad, Kielyr said "interesting!"

31:58.751 --> 32:00.211
"Interesting" is a non-word.

32:00.295 --> 32:01.546
You know you're supposed to avoid it.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.047
Be specific.

32:03.131 --> 32:05.633
- It's disturbing.
- More specific.

32:05.717 --> 32:07.051
Can I just read?

32:07.135 --> 32:09.470
After you give us your analysis thus far.

32:09.554 --> 32:13.308
There's this old man who loves this girl,

32:13.391 --> 32:16.477
- and she's only 12 years old.
- That's the plot.

32:24.319 --> 32:27.655
Because it's written from his perspective,

32:27.780 --> 32:31.159
you sort of understand
and sympathize with him.

32:31.242 --> 32:33.661
Which is kind of amazing

32:33.786 --> 32:37.165
because he's essentially a child molester.

32:37.290 --> 32:40.960
But his love for her is beautiful.

32:42.003 --> 32:46.424
But it's also sort of a trick
because it's so wrong.

32:46.507 --> 32:51.137
You know, he's old,
and he basically rapes her.

32:51.679 --> 32:54.641
So it makes me feel...

32:57.310 --> 32:58.645
I hate him.

32:59.687 --> 33:02.690
And somehow I feel sorry
for him at the same time.

33:04.692 --> 33:05.818
Well done.

33:08.988 --> 33:10.031
What does "rape" mean?

33:13.618 --> 33:18.039
When a person, usually a man,
forces another person, usually a woman,

33:18.164 --> 33:20.166
to have sexual intercourse.

33:20.249 --> 33:21.376
Oh.

33:21.459 --> 33:23.795
- Who's hungry?
- Me!

33:24.712 --> 33:27.965
What's "sexual intercourse"?

33:29.884 --> 33:33.554
When a man sticks his penis
in a woman's vagina.

33:34.222 --> 33:36.474
Everyone keep their eyes peeled for deer.

33:36.557 --> 33:40.561
Why would a man stick his penis
in a woman's vagina?

33:42.021 --> 33:45.316
Because it can give them both pleasure.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.568
And because the combination
of a man's sperm

33:47.652 --> 33:51.572
and a woman's egg can create a baby
and continue the human race.

33:51.656 --> 33:54.242
But that's where she pees.

33:55.076 --> 33:58.162
Pee comes not from the vagina,
but from the urethra,

33:58.246 --> 34:00.665
which is within the outer labia.

34:00.748 --> 34:04.252
But generally speaking, yes,
that is where she pees.

34:05.503 --> 34:08.089
Everyone keep your eyes open
for game of any kind.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.623
Okay.

34:47.378 --> 34:48.795
Now what?

34:49.380 --> 34:50.630
What's wrong with everyone?

34:50.882 --> 34:52.216
Are they sick?

34:52.300 --> 34:54.552
- What do you mean?
- Everyone's so fat.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.931
- Yeah, they are.
- Fat like hippos.

34:59.307 --> 35:01.309
- That's not nice to say.
- But look!

35:05.062 --> 35:08.149
Okay, you can think that,
but we don't make fun of people.

35:08.649 --> 35:09.901
- Right, Dad?
- That's right.

35:09.984 --> 35:11.736
We don't make fun of people.

35:11.819 --> 35:13.070
Except Christians.

35:27.084 --> 35:29.212
Dad? Dad?

35:32.799 --> 35:33.841
Shit.

35:43.100 --> 35:47.688
This, right now,
this is your first real test.

35:48.356 --> 35:51.484
Stay calm, remember your training.

35:55.488 --> 35:56.948
Morning. How you doing today?

35:57.031 --> 35:58.199
Morning, Officer.

35:58.282 --> 36:00.201
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

36:00.326 --> 36:01.869
Certainly.

36:03.287 --> 36:06.290
- Nice rig.
- Thank you.

36:06.374 --> 36:08.709
I pulled you over because
your back left taillight is out.

36:08.835 --> 36:09.836
Did you know that?

36:10.211 --> 36:12.380
No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

36:13.047 --> 36:14.465
I'll be right back.

36:20.179 --> 36:21.180
No school today?

36:23.349 --> 36:24.517
Not yet.

36:39.740 --> 36:42.910
Man, by his sin,
has become separated from God.

36:42.994 --> 36:44.912
And only through personally
accepting the gift

36:45.037 --> 36:47.832
of reconciliation purchased
by Jesus on the cross

36:47.915 --> 36:50.501
can he regain his fellowship with God.

36:50.585 --> 36:52.837
We're home-schooled. Father, may I?

36:54.589 --> 36:56.007
You may.

36:56.173 --> 36:59.927
One day when Heaven
was filled with his praises

37:00.094 --> 37:03.931
One day when sin was as black as could be

37:04.599 --> 37:09.020
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin

37:09.270 --> 37:13.274
Dwelt among men, my example is He

37:13.774 --> 37:17.278
Living, He loved me, dying, He saved me

37:17.403 --> 37:18.446
I really should go.

37:18.529 --> 37:22.116
Buried, He carried my sins far away

37:22.241 --> 37:23.701
Seriously... Look,
I really need to get going.

37:23.784 --> 37:26.454
Sorry about that, I gotta
get back to work. Sounds great.

37:26.579 --> 37:28.039
When you get a minute,
fix that taillight, okay?

37:28.122 --> 37:29.707
I'll do it right away, sir.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.709
- Have a good day, guys.
- God bless.

37:31.792 --> 37:33.586
God bless!

37:35.963 --> 37:37.131
Power to the people.

37:37.798 --> 37:39.425
Stick it to the man.

38:21.509 --> 38:23.177
They're just standing there.

38:42.863 --> 38:44.490
I miss Mom.

39:10.641 --> 39:12.059
Hey.

39:15.479 --> 39:19.191
No. No Esperanto. I'm not joking.

39:21.819 --> 39:25.156
No foreign language unless
the language is spoken by all.

39:25.239 --> 39:26.365
You know the rule.

39:37.418 --> 39:40.921
No Esperanto! Please.

39:41.756 --> 39:42.840
I'm hungry.

39:42.923 --> 39:46.093
Well, then maybe one of you
should have shot the fucking sheep.

39:57.271 --> 39:58.689
They have hot dogs!

40:00.441 --> 40:03.194
- What's "cola"?
- Poison water.

40:03.277 --> 40:04.612
Can I have the grilled cheese?

40:04.737 --> 40:05.696
No.

40:05.780 --> 40:07.281
What's a "milkshake"?

40:07.364 --> 40:09.366
Dad, can I have a hamburger and fries?

40:09.450 --> 40:10.451
Can I have pancakes?

40:11.952 --> 40:14.205
Okay, everyone up. We're outta here.

40:14.288 --> 40:15.706
What? No, why?

40:15.790 --> 40:19.293
Because there's no actual food
on this menu. Let's go.

41:22.815 --> 41:24.108
Are you okay?

41:26.026 --> 41:28.529
An old man's having a heart attack!
Call 911!

41:29.196 --> 41:30.531
Call 911!

41:31.448 --> 41:33.200
Everyone, get back!

41:34.118 --> 41:35.119
My pills!

42:00.352 --> 42:02.313
- I'm okay.
- He's okay now.

42:02.479 --> 42:04.398
- Sir?
- Sorry.

42:05.733 --> 42:07.193
Sir?

42:07.735 --> 42:08.986
Sir?

42:09.528 --> 42:11.697
- Sir?
- Sorry about the fuss.

42:12.072 --> 42:13.741
Are you sure we can't get you
an ambulance or anything?

42:13.866 --> 42:16.160
No, I just forgot to take my pills.

42:16.243 --> 42:18.245
I'm fine now, really.

42:38.265 --> 42:40.184
Where else can we improve?

42:40.267 --> 42:43.270
Flawed exit strategy.
Everyone went out the same doors.

42:43.395 --> 42:45.439
No one utilized
the loading dock area at all.

42:45.564 --> 42:47.691
- If it got blocked, we'd all be trapped.
- Mmm-hmm.

42:47.775 --> 42:49.693
Inadequately planned extraction point.

42:49.777 --> 42:51.695
We probably shouldn't have
all gone directly to the bus.

42:51.779 --> 42:54.198
Predetermined pick-ups
would have been much less risky.

42:54.281 --> 42:56.742
On the plus side, Mission:
Free the Food, accomplished.

42:56.867 --> 42:59.286
- Mission: Free the Food!
- Top marks all around.

42:59.370 --> 43:02.122
Now, if you'd all do me a favor
and close your eyes.

43:06.794 --> 43:08.796
You may open your eyes.

43:09.755 --> 43:11.507
Happy Noam Chomsky Day.

43:11.590 --> 43:13.467
But Noam was born on December 7th.

43:13.592 --> 43:14.969
Well, we're celebrating it today.

43:17.221 --> 43:18.222
Yes!

43:28.107 --> 43:29.566
So good.

43:41.287 --> 43:45.124
Uncle Noam, it's the day of your birth!

43:45.207 --> 43:48.377
Uncle Noam, it's the day of your birth!

43:48.460 --> 43:52.631
Uncle Noam, it's the day
of your birth! Uncle Noam!

43:52.715 --> 43:57.720
Uncle Noam, Uncle Noam!

43:57.845 --> 43:59.013
All hail!

44:01.432 --> 44:03.600
- Here we go. Nai.
- Yes.

44:03.684 --> 44:05.060
- Bodevan.
- Thank you.

44:05.144 --> 44:06.145
Rellian.

44:08.480 --> 44:09.648
Rell.

44:09.732 --> 44:12.401
Kielyr, Vespyr, Zaj.

44:12.484 --> 44:13.485
All right, go for it.

44:14.737 --> 44:15.988
Dad!

44:16.447 --> 44:19.450
Fifty-five-pound pull,
laminated wood and glass.

44:19.616 --> 44:20.617
Whoa!

44:21.327 --> 44:22.995
A KA-BAR fighting knife?

44:23.078 --> 44:24.747
- That's right.
- Thanks, Dad!

44:24.830 --> 44:26.290
It's so beautiful.

44:26.623 --> 44:30.586
Seven-inch blade, partially serrated,
well-balanced if you dip when you cut.

44:31.754 --> 44:32.755
Pictures.

44:35.007 --> 44:36.008
Oh.

44:36.091 --> 44:38.844
Those are Black Storm broadheads.
Razor sharp.

44:41.930 --> 44:44.975
What kind of crazy person celebrates
Noam Chomsky's birthday

44:45.059 --> 44:46.977
like it's some kind of official holiday?

44:47.519 --> 44:50.147
Why can't we celebrate Christmas
like the rest of the entire world?

44:50.522 --> 44:54.318
You would prefer to celebrate
a magical fictitious elf

44:54.401 --> 44:56.570
instead of a living humanitarian

44:56.653 --> 44:59.656
who's done so much to promote
human rights and understanding?

45:00.491 --> 45:02.451
Okay, well, let's have a discourse.

45:05.788 --> 45:07.873
- Forget it.
- No, explain.

45:09.083 --> 45:11.210
Take the opportunity to make your case.

45:11.293 --> 45:12.920
We're all open to hearing your arguments.

45:13.003 --> 45:14.922
And if they're valid and you persuade us,

45:15.005 --> 45:18.133
I'm sure we'd all be willing
to change our minds. Right?

45:18.801 --> 45:21.345
- Yeah.
- Use your words.

45:49.540 --> 45:50.624
Ah!

45:54.128 --> 45:57.589
- Yes! Thanks, Dad!
- You're welcome.

46:25.868 --> 46:26.952
Do you guys need a hand?

46:27.035 --> 46:29.079
- No, we're fine.
- No, we got it.

46:30.789 --> 46:31.790
All right.

46:31.874 --> 46:34.334
- Jackson, not at the table.
- Hey.

46:34.835 --> 46:37.171
- Jackson.
- All right.

46:38.422 --> 46:40.591
Well, I am so happy

46:40.674 --> 46:44.052
that our family is together.

46:44.803 --> 46:46.430
Thanks for putting on this feast.

46:47.306 --> 46:51.101
It's all local and, um,
organic and non-GMO, so...

46:51.185 --> 46:52.686
How did you kill those chickens?

46:52.936 --> 46:54.688
With an ax or a knife?

46:57.900 --> 47:01.737
I didn't have to kill the chickens.

47:03.906 --> 47:06.450
It's a rotisserie chicken, so you buy it.

47:06.533 --> 47:09.453
It's already dead. Or cooked. On a thing.

47:13.999 --> 47:16.001
- Dig in.
- All right.

47:18.378 --> 47:20.714
- Ben, some wine?
- Please.

47:24.801 --> 47:26.887
Dad, can I have some wine?

47:26.970 --> 47:30.140
- Sure, why not?
- Ben. No.

47:30.224 --> 47:31.517
Children don't drink wine.

47:31.600 --> 47:35.437
In France, and other countries, children
drink small amounts of wine all the time.

47:35.521 --> 47:37.814
It's a digestive. It's not crack.

47:37.898 --> 47:39.233
What's crack?

47:39.900 --> 47:44.112
Crack is a crystallized,
highly addictive derivative

47:44.196 --> 47:45.489
of the stimulant cocaine.

47:45.781 --> 47:49.785
In the mid-1980s, it accelerated
the decimation of inner-city neighborhoods.

47:49.868 --> 47:52.621
Crackheads, some of them kids
just like you guys,

47:52.704 --> 47:56.375
were killing each other over
nothing, over their Nikes.

47:56.667 --> 47:58.544
They killed each other for Nike?

47:58.627 --> 48:00.546
The Greek winged goddess of victory?

48:03.382 --> 48:05.759
- Stop.
- He's joking, right?

48:07.803 --> 48:10.597
- They're like Adidas.
- Who's Adidas?

48:10.847 --> 48:12.474
You're serious?

48:14.560 --> 48:15.769
They're shoes.

48:22.025 --> 48:23.026
Now.

48:24.528 --> 48:25.696
Ben.

48:25.779 --> 48:27.239
We're, uh...

48:28.699 --> 48:31.493
I'm sorry for your loss.

48:31.577 --> 48:33.370
We're devastated.

48:34.997 --> 48:39.293
- We're just so sorry.
- Thank you, Dave.

48:42.170 --> 48:44.715
I don't know what else to say. I'm like...

48:45.799 --> 48:49.136
It's okay. We all know
you had issues with Leslie.

48:49.678 --> 48:51.597
- What?
- It's not a secret.

48:51.680 --> 48:54.057
I wouldn't say that. Why would you...

48:54.141 --> 48:55.934
Last time we saw you,
you called her a "fucking bitch."

48:56.018 --> 48:58.687
- Ben.
- What? It's fine.

48:59.396 --> 49:01.315
My kids remember. Don't you, guys?

49:01.648 --> 49:02.774
Yeah.

49:02.858 --> 49:06.653
Wait, no. I said that...

49:08.155 --> 49:12.659
We were all having a huge,
uh, fight about sugar.

49:12.909 --> 49:16.538
I had given the kids some,
what, Frosted Mini-Wheats.

49:16.663 --> 49:18.832
And the extremity of her position...

49:20.334 --> 49:22.711
She was yelling at me,
she pushed me, and I said...

49:22.836 --> 49:23.879
"Don't be such a fucking bitch."

49:24.004 --> 49:25.005
- Ben.
- I didn't say that.

49:25.088 --> 49:27.966
They're just words.
Your words, but just words.

49:28.050 --> 49:29.134
Not spoken in this house.

49:29.217 --> 49:32.387
No, it's inappropriate for him
to say that in front of the kids.

49:34.890 --> 49:38.018
Absolutely, understood.
It won't happen again.

49:38.101 --> 49:39.102
Okay.

49:49.404 --> 49:51.239
Dad, how did Aunt Leslie die?

49:51.365 --> 49:53.200
Well, Aunt Leslie was sick

49:53.283 --> 49:57.663
and she had, uh,
complications from her sickness.

49:57.746 --> 49:58.789
Yeah.

50:01.541 --> 50:03.043
She had a mental illness.

50:03.460 --> 50:05.212
Bipolar affective disorder.

50:05.462 --> 50:07.464
We think it started
right after Bo was born.

50:07.547 --> 50:10.217
Probably a form of postpartum psychosis.

50:11.093 --> 50:14.388
She'd have violent mood
swings ranging from mania,

50:14.471 --> 50:18.892
where she'd be elated and make
elaborate plans for the future,

50:18.975 --> 50:21.770
to severe depression where
she'd become almost catatonic.

50:23.230 --> 50:25.107
Utterly without hope.

50:26.733 --> 50:29.194
We didn't understand what was happening.

50:29.277 --> 50:31.738
We don't need to talk about
this in front of the children.

50:31.822 --> 50:33.323
These are details that are...

50:33.407 --> 50:37.661
The doctors, uh, put her in the hospital,

50:37.744 --> 50:41.707
they gave her medicine,
but she was really sick.

50:41.790 --> 50:46.461
- Yeah.
- And she died.

50:49.798 --> 50:51.258
Sick people die.

50:55.137 --> 50:58.306
Sometimes they... They die.

50:59.182 --> 51:01.435
She died 'cause of...

51:03.520 --> 51:05.814
Because of... Because of the sickness.

51:05.939 --> 51:06.940
She slit her wrists.

51:07.441 --> 51:09.651
She killed herself. That's what happened.

51:10.277 --> 51:11.278
Or that.

51:25.625 --> 51:26.960
Excuse me.

51:40.348 --> 51:42.476
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Thank you.

51:45.187 --> 51:46.271
Bo.

51:56.281 --> 51:58.492
- To Mom.
- To Mom.

52:03.163 --> 52:04.331
Shh.

52:09.503 --> 52:11.004
Combo!

52:14.299 --> 52:15.759
Extreme combo!

52:17.177 --> 52:18.804
Victory!

52:21.473 --> 52:23.099
We're just doing the best we can, Ben!

52:23.225 --> 52:24.518
- That's all anybody is doing!
- So am I!

52:24.643 --> 52:26.061
Just the best that we know how.

52:26.186 --> 52:28.313
I'm really sorry it doesn't live up
to your high standards!

52:28.396 --> 52:30.148
I tell the truth to my kids.
I don't lie to my kids.

52:30.232 --> 52:32.901
Protecting children from certain concepts

52:33.026 --> 52:35.654
that they are too young to understand
is not lying to them.

52:35.737 --> 52:38.198
Guys! We have neighbors, okay?

52:38.865 --> 52:42.118
Look, it's a very hard time right now.

52:42.202 --> 52:43.495
Everybody's still a little raw.

52:43.578 --> 52:47.707
Can we just try to, come on,
put this to bed, all right?

52:54.339 --> 52:55.549
I apologize.

52:57.050 --> 53:00.387
I'm sorry for not respecting the way
you guys do things in your home.

53:03.431 --> 53:05.225
Thank you for saying that.

53:11.189 --> 53:14.985
I know Leslie had been sick for a long time,
but I cannot imagine how difficult

53:15.068 --> 53:16.570
this time must be for you.

53:32.294 --> 53:34.212
Guys, what are you doing?

53:34.296 --> 53:35.922
We're sleeping under the stars.

53:36.923 --> 53:37.883
But...

53:37.966 --> 53:39.759
We made up the rec room downstairs,

53:39.885 --> 53:41.261
- for a sleepover.
- Yeah.

53:42.429 --> 53:45.807
We're fine here. We're fine.

53:48.059 --> 53:49.144
Good.

54:03.617 --> 54:05.327
Why do they have to take showers?

54:05.452 --> 54:07.412
They're not taking a shower.
I mean, it looks like a shower,

54:07.537 --> 54:09.289
but it's really a gas chamber.

54:09.372 --> 54:10.665
Jackson, put that thing away

54:10.749 --> 54:13.293
or I'm going to put it in the microwave,
press "Popcorn."

54:13.376 --> 54:14.461
All right.

54:14.586 --> 54:16.129
Actually, why don't you take your cousins

54:16.212 --> 54:18.381
and go show them your action figure guys?

54:18.465 --> 54:19.549
Why?

54:19.633 --> 54:20.884
Because they may never
have seen them before.

54:20.967 --> 54:21.968
It might be fun.

54:22.052 --> 54:24.095
So, can we play Xbox afterwards?

54:24.471 --> 54:25.722
One game. Go.

54:25.805 --> 54:26.890
Yes!

54:28.642 --> 54:31.478
- Thank you.
- Yeah, try it.

54:39.986 --> 54:42.322
- How are the kids doing?
- They're strong.

54:44.115 --> 54:46.576
How long have you been out there,
wherever it is you're living now?

54:46.660 --> 54:48.662
We left Boulder when Bo was three.

54:49.663 --> 54:53.416
And then we were on that farm
we had in Oregon until he was eight.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.502
So, we bought the land
in the forest 10 years ago.

54:55.627 --> 54:57.128
How do you still have money?

54:58.838 --> 55:00.090
We only buy what we need.

55:00.173 --> 55:03.009
Look, Harper and I have been talking.

55:04.636 --> 55:06.429
The kids need structure, stability.

55:06.513 --> 55:08.515
They need to go to a real school,

55:08.640 --> 55:10.433
- so they can get real jobs.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

55:10.517 --> 55:11.810
You're going to get them killed!

55:11.977 --> 55:13.186
Whoa.

55:20.110 --> 55:21.528
I'm sorry.

55:21.653 --> 55:23.697
But your kids are without a mother now.

55:23.822 --> 55:26.700
I don't think you have any idea
what you're doing to them.

55:26.825 --> 55:29.369
I'm saving their lives,
that's what I'm doing.

55:29.452 --> 55:31.788
Ben, you sound so ridiculous.

55:31.871 --> 55:35.625
Is knowing how to set a broken bone
or how to treat a severe burn ridiculous?

55:35.709 --> 55:39.337
Knowing how to navigate by the stars
in total darkness, that's ridiculous?

55:39.838 --> 55:43.216
How to identify edible plants,
how to make clothes from animal skins,

55:43.299 --> 55:45.385
how to survive in the forest
with nothing but a knife?

55:45.510 --> 55:46.720
That's ridiculous to you?

55:47.137 --> 55:48.138
Jesus.

55:48.221 --> 55:51.808
They have the cardiovascular and muscular
endurance levels of elite athletes.

55:51.891 --> 55:53.977
Who cares? They're children.

55:54.060 --> 55:56.938
They need to go to school,
they need to learn about the world.

55:59.733 --> 56:02.193
Justin? Jackson?

56:02.527 --> 56:04.904
Would you please
come down here for a second?

56:15.165 --> 56:16.249
What?

56:17.083 --> 56:18.835
How old are you now, Jackson?

56:18.918 --> 56:20.086
Thirteen.

56:22.172 --> 56:24.424
Can you tell me what
the Bill of Rights is?

56:27.761 --> 56:30.096
What something costs? I guess.

56:30.221 --> 56:31.598
That's a good guess.

56:31.723 --> 56:34.017
- Justin, you're in high school?
- Yeah.

56:34.100 --> 56:37.312
- Do you like your school?
- It's whatever.

56:39.272 --> 56:40.732
Do you know what the Bill of Rights is?

56:42.525 --> 56:44.611
It's a government thing, right?

56:44.736 --> 56:47.363
Like, rights that people
have in America and stuff...

56:47.947 --> 56:51.034
- Yep. Hey, Zaja!
- Yes!

56:51.451 --> 56:54.120
Would you please come down here
a moment, sweetie?

56:56.623 --> 56:58.416
I wanted to ask you a quick question.

56:59.209 --> 57:01.419
Zaja just turned eight, by the way.

57:02.879 --> 57:04.047
Bill of Rights.

57:04.923 --> 57:07.383
Amendment 1, Congress shall make no law

57:07.467 --> 57:12.097
respecting an establishment of religion
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,

57:12.555 --> 57:13.807
or abridging the freedom of...

57:13.890 --> 57:17.477
Stop. Regurgitating memorized
amendments isn't what I'm asking for.

57:17.811 --> 57:20.480
Just tell me something
about it in your own words.

57:22.816 --> 57:26.152
Without the Bill of Rights,
we'd be more like China.

57:26.319 --> 57:29.364
Here, at least,
we don't have warrantless searches,

57:29.447 --> 57:33.493
we have free speech, citizens are protected
from cruel and unusual punishments...

57:33.618 --> 57:35.078
- That's enough.
- Are protected...

57:35.161 --> 57:36.996
Wait a minute. Zaja...

57:37.080 --> 57:38.164
How would you characterize

57:38.248 --> 57:41.417
the 2010 Supreme Court
decision on Citizens United?

57:42.794 --> 57:44.754
Corporations have
the same rights as people,

57:44.838 --> 57:46.840
so there's no spending limit
on candidates.

57:47.340 --> 57:50.426
Which means our country
is ruled by corporations

57:50.510 --> 57:52.679
and their lobbyists who fund candidates

57:52.762 --> 57:54.430
and command their fealty
by demanding that...

57:54.514 --> 57:55.890
Jesus Christ.

57:56.141 --> 57:57.517
You made your point, we get it.

57:59.644 --> 58:02.021
It's very impressive. All of you.

59:51.798 --> 59:52.799
Is that yoga?

59:56.386 --> 59:58.888
Your breath, they call it pranayama.

59:58.972 --> 01:00:01.766
It flows with your movements, your asana.

01:00:01.933 --> 01:00:04.227
It's supposed to connect the mind
and the body to fuel your Samadhi.

01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:07.772
Does that really work?

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:29.335
I'm Claire.

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:34.299
- Bodevan.
- "Bodevan"?

01:00:35.174 --> 01:00:36.843
What kind of a name is that?

01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:42.974
My parents made it up.

01:00:44.183 --> 01:00:45.852
That's weird. Why?

01:00:46.185 --> 01:00:47.395
Our names are unique.

01:00:48.187 --> 01:00:50.315
There's only one of us in the whole world.

01:00:52.358 --> 01:00:53.651
That's really weird.

01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:09.876
What kind of music do you listen to?

01:01:11.461 --> 01:01:12.837
Mostly Bach.

01:01:13.629 --> 01:01:17.050
Mainly the Goldberg Variations,
especially Glenn Gould's versions.

01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:21.471
I also like the Unaccompanied Cello Suites,
preferably when played by Yo-Yo Ma.

01:01:26.351 --> 01:01:27.810
Where are you from?

01:01:30.563 --> 01:01:33.066
Most recently in Paris, in the Marais.

01:01:34.275 --> 01:01:35.526
Near Victor Hugo's house.

01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:40.073
We're just back in the States
because of my dad's sabbatical.

01:01:40.198 --> 01:01:44.243
He's writing a book on Dr. Spock.

01:01:44.327 --> 01:01:46.746
Oh. I love Star Trek, it's awesome.

01:01:48.623 --> 01:01:49.624
Which star?

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:51.751
You know, Spock.

01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:54.670
The guy with the ears,
he's from Star Trek.

01:01:54.754 --> 01:01:56.589
No, Dr. Spock was from Connecticut.

01:01:56.672 --> 01:01:59.926
Right after Yale, he wrote
Baby and Child Care in 1947.

01:02:00.009 --> 01:02:02.220
It's one of the seminal books
on child-rearing.

01:02:02.428 --> 01:02:06.182
I was talking about that old TV show.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.893
Oh.

01:02:09.102 --> 01:02:10.853
- "Child-rearing."
- Of course.

01:02:10.937 --> 01:02:13.106
Yeah, I know that one, it's...

01:02:14.315 --> 01:02:15.316
Awesome.

01:02:20.405 --> 01:02:21.489
And what about your mom?

01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:28.287
I can't talk about it.

01:02:30.456 --> 01:02:32.375
She works for the U.S. government.

01:02:33.835 --> 01:02:36.963
I can't talk about it due
to its highly classified nature.

01:02:37.046 --> 01:02:38.089
Seriously?

01:02:38.548 --> 01:02:40.174
I can't say any more.

01:02:40.258 --> 01:02:42.468
I don't even know that much myself.

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:44.095
It's, um...

01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:47.348
I shouldn't have told you.

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:50.643
You can't tell anyone.

01:03:22.049 --> 01:03:23.217
Are you okay?

01:03:26.846 --> 01:03:28.514
Yeah.

01:03:51.245 --> 01:03:52.330
Okay.

01:03:53.206 --> 01:03:54.707
Follow me. We have to be quiet.

01:04:03.382 --> 01:04:05.051
It's almost midnight.

01:04:07.887 --> 01:04:10.181
I sincerely hope you two lovebirds

01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:12.558
haven't been doing
what I think you've been doing.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:20.233
I know what you think.

01:04:20.316 --> 01:04:22.652
But I know that your daughter
has taught me many things just now.

01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:26.197
She has broadened my mind,
she has helped me grow.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.241
When we just kissed
for the first time just then,

01:04:28.324 --> 01:04:30.409
the endorphins that your daughter
sent through my body

01:04:30.493 --> 01:04:32.411
were like dolphins swimming
through my bloodstream.

01:04:32.495 --> 01:04:35.289
The way she has opened me up,
she has penetrated deep inside of me

01:04:35.373 --> 01:04:38.000
and I know that I have penetrated deep,
deep inside of your daughter.

01:04:39.418 --> 01:04:40.670
Not... Not like that.

01:04:40.753 --> 01:04:42.380
I would love to

01:04:42.463 --> 01:04:45.508
when is necessary for...

01:04:45.633 --> 01:04:48.302
I want kids someday.
Not right now, of course,

01:04:48.386 --> 01:04:49.720
but when you're ready and when I'm ready,

01:04:49.804 --> 01:04:51.264
because I think this should
be a shared decision.

01:04:51.347 --> 01:04:53.307
This is a decision
that we should make together.

01:04:53.391 --> 01:04:55.643
But when you are ready, I will be ready.

01:04:56.811 --> 01:05:00.022
I am ready for you, if you will have me.

01:05:01.857 --> 01:05:03.192
Claire...

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:06.654
What's your last name?

01:05:06.862 --> 01:05:08.114
M... McCune.

01:05:08.197 --> 01:05:09.740
Claire McCune,

01:05:11.117 --> 01:05:12.827
will you be my wife?

01:05:23.963 --> 01:05:26.841
Okay, funny man,
I'm sure your dad's waiting up.

01:05:28.175 --> 01:05:30.094
Don't worry, you'll see her tomorrow.

01:05:31.012 --> 01:05:32.179
Good night.

01:06:15.348 --> 01:06:16.390
It's just a penis.

01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:19.143
Every man has one.

01:06:19.435 --> 01:06:21.729
We're all animals of the Earth.

01:06:22.438 --> 01:06:24.482
Clothes when we eat.

01:07:59.118 --> 01:08:01.954
- You look happy.
- I am happy.

01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:03.205
Are you happy?

01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:05.249
Yeah. I'm here with you.

01:08:21.432 --> 01:08:25.310
O God, to whom mercy
and forgiveness belong,

01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:29.732
hear our prayer on behalf
of your servant Leslie Cash,

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:33.109
whom you have taken out of the world.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:37.281
And because she put her
trust and hope in you,

01:08:37.782 --> 01:08:40.826
command that she be carried
safely home to Heaven

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:46.122
and come to enjoy your eternal reward.

01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:47.374
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:08:50.127 --> 01:08:51.629
Come on, guys.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.144
Do you mind scooting over, sir?

01:09:17.488 --> 01:09:20.323
I did not know Leslie personally

01:09:21.325 --> 01:09:23.452
and I am poorer for it.

01:09:24.286 --> 01:09:28.791
I understand that she was a loving
mother who gave up her law practice

01:09:28.874 --> 01:09:30.209
to raise her children.

01:09:30.835 --> 01:09:32.502
Leslie loved her mother, Abigail,

01:09:32.586 --> 01:09:36.173
and her father, Jack, and their dogs,

01:09:36.966 --> 01:09:39.134
Harvey and Little Bear.

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:42.429
They told me that she also loved gardening

01:09:42.805 --> 01:09:47.142
and classical music,
particularly Glenn Gould's versions

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:49.520
of the Goldberg Variations.

01:09:50.437 --> 01:09:54.942
She also liked walks
in the moonlight on the beach.

01:09:55.818 --> 01:09:59.655
And she loved her husband,
Ben, and their children...

01:09:59.738 --> 01:10:02.950
I'll, uh, take that as my cue, if I may.

01:10:13.919 --> 01:10:17.298
First of all, Leslie practiced Buddhism,

01:10:17.965 --> 01:10:21.343
which, to her, was a philosophy
and not an organized religion.

01:10:21.427 --> 01:10:24.763
In fact, Leslie abhorred
all organized religions.

01:10:24.847 --> 01:10:28.267
To her, they were the most
dangerous fairy tales ever invented.

01:10:28.559 --> 01:10:33.022
Designed to elicit blind obedience and
strike fear into the hearts of the innocent

01:10:33.105 --> 01:10:34.648
and the uninformed.

01:10:34.732 --> 01:10:37.067
To her, the only thing worse than death

01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:39.403
would have been the knowledge
that her rotting flesh

01:10:39.486 --> 01:10:41.906
was to be trapped
for all eternity inside a big box

01:10:43.532 --> 01:10:45.701
and buried in the middle
of a fucking golf course.

01:10:49.163 --> 01:10:54.001
Although the absurdity of being eulogized
by someone that didn't even know her

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:58.213
has exactly the kind of comedic flourish
that Leslie would have cherished.

01:10:58.547 --> 01:11:00.674
If nothing else, she had a sense of humor.

01:11:01.634 --> 01:11:05.179
I want to read something to all of you,
so you'll know what I mean.

01:11:06.138 --> 01:11:08.599
Leslie's last will and testament.

01:11:08.724 --> 01:11:11.268
And I quote, "In the event of my death,

01:11:11.352 --> 01:11:13.562
"I, Leslie Abigail Cash,

01:11:13.646 --> 01:11:15.689
"as a Buddhist, wish to be cremated.

01:11:15.773 --> 01:11:17.608
"My funeral, such as it is,

01:11:17.691 --> 01:11:20.194
"shall be a celebration of the life cycle,

01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:22.404
"with music and dancing.

01:11:22.863 --> 01:11:25.616
"After, it is my expressed
desire that my ashes

01:11:25.908 --> 01:11:28.243
"shall be taken to a nondescript location,

01:11:28.327 --> 01:11:30.704
"preferably public and heavily populated.

01:11:30.788 --> 01:11:34.375
"At which point my ashes,
promptly and unceremoniously,

01:11:34.458 --> 01:11:36.502
"are to be flushed
down the nearest toilet."

01:11:37.002 --> 01:11:38.796
End quote.

01:11:39.964 --> 01:11:41.173
Now, that's comedy.

01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:42.800
- All right, that's enough.
- I'm not finished.

01:11:42.883 --> 01:11:44.760
Hey, I'm not finished.

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:46.387
- Dad!
- You're not listening to me!

01:11:46.512 --> 01:11:47.972
- This is not what she wanted!
- Dad!

01:11:48.055 --> 01:11:49.390
- Just keep moving forward.
- Let go of me!

01:11:49.473 --> 01:11:50.641
Okay, that's it, come on.

01:11:50.724 --> 01:11:52.851
- Dad!
- She's my wife!

01:11:52.935 --> 01:11:56.021
This is her will!
This is against her wishes!

01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:59.692
God damn it! We have songs to sing!

01:11:59.775 --> 01:12:00.943
Dad!

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:02.987
If you'll open your books,

01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:09.118
we'll read this morning
from Matthew 18, verses 15-20.

01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:48.115
You are the worst thing that
has ever happened to my family.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.576
Why won't you respect
your daughter's wishes?

01:12:50.659 --> 01:12:52.119
Or your grandchildren's?

01:12:52.578 --> 01:12:53.912
Hi, kids.

01:12:54.913 --> 01:12:56.623
Hello, Grandpa, I'm Nai.

01:12:56.749 --> 01:12:58.500
Nai. We've never met.

01:12:58.584 --> 01:12:59.752
Gee, Abby.

01:12:59.835 --> 01:13:02.254
I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:13:05.591 --> 01:13:06.925
Hi, honey.

01:13:07.885 --> 01:13:10.888
Grandma!

01:13:11.096 --> 01:13:12.639
Hello, Grandma.

01:13:12.848 --> 01:13:16.101
We're all together. Isn't this wonderful?

01:13:16.185 --> 01:13:18.645
Abby and I are going to take
the children to the ceremony

01:13:18.771 --> 01:13:20.814
and then you can follow us to the house.

01:13:21.273 --> 01:13:23.901
They're my kids, they're staying with me.

01:13:23.984 --> 01:13:26.653
Children, I'm sorry
that you have to witness this,

01:13:26.779 --> 01:13:29.114
but I don't think your father
is fit to attend the funeral.

01:13:29.198 --> 01:13:31.116
We're not going to let you
put her in the ground!

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.118
Who do you think the police
are going to listen to? Me?

01:13:33.786 --> 01:13:36.121
Or some hippie in a clown outfit?

01:13:36.872 --> 01:13:37.956
Come on, Abby.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.124
Where are we going?

01:13:39.208 --> 01:13:40.501
We're going to see Leslie. We have to go.

01:13:40.626 --> 01:13:42.878
- I'm visiting with the children.
- We have to see them at the house.

01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:44.546
Would you just give me
a minute with the children?

01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:46.006
Honey, honey, Leslie is waiting.

01:13:46.131 --> 01:13:47.966
Leslie is waiting. Come on.

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:51.720
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye, Grandma and Grandpa.

01:13:57.726 --> 01:13:59.645
Back on Steve, let's go.

01:14:00.145 --> 01:14:01.855
- Dad?
- Let's go.

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:03.148
Dad, where are we going?

01:14:03.232 --> 01:14:04.733
We're going to stop this fucking funeral!

01:14:04.817 --> 01:14:06.485
- Dad!
- No!

01:14:06.568 --> 01:14:07.569
Dad!

01:14:08.403 --> 01:14:09.571
Dad, we can't go.

01:14:09.655 --> 01:14:10.864
Please, just listen to us.

01:14:10.989 --> 01:14:13.158
- Why can't we go to Mom's funeral?
- Because of Dad.

01:14:13.242 --> 01:14:14.535
- Because of his speech?
- Yes!

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:17.246
Everyone shut up and sit down!
Sit the fuck down!

01:14:17.329 --> 01:14:18.497
- Dad.
- Silence!

01:14:19.039 --> 01:14:20.415
Put your goddamn seat belts on!

01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:21.875
- No! Stop Steve!
- You heard Grandpa!

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.252
He'll have us arrested if we show up!

01:14:23.335 --> 01:14:25.129
They are not stopping us from saving Mom!

01:14:25.212 --> 01:14:26.421
Dad, abort the mission!

01:14:26.505 --> 01:14:28.507
Let's just go home! Abort the mission!

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:29.967
We are rescuing Mom!

01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:31.343
Mom is dead, okay, Dad? She's dead!

01:14:31.426 --> 01:14:32.845
This is not what she would
have wanted you to do!

01:14:33.011 --> 01:14:35.222
- They have no right!
- I don't want to lose you!

01:14:36.932 --> 01:14:40.435
Please. We can't lose you, too.

01:15:09.047 --> 01:15:10.632
Motherfuck!

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:28.961
I have memories of Mom

01:16:30.462 --> 01:16:31.463
laughing.

01:16:35.133 --> 01:16:37.511
I... I can't even remember when that was.

01:16:45.811 --> 01:16:48.480
Mom had psychotic episodes.

01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:51.483
She had hallucinations.

01:16:54.486 --> 01:16:56.488
Of smashing our heads in with rocks.

01:16:57.489 --> 01:16:59.157
I heard them talking about it.

01:17:04.871 --> 01:17:07.249
Mom was sicker than any of us knew.

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.002
Dad made her crazy.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.842
Dad's dangerous.

01:17:22.681 --> 01:17:24.850
You think our lives are so great.

01:17:25.267 --> 01:17:27.519
You think Dad is so perfect.

01:18:06.224 --> 01:18:08.685
Yale, Stanford, Princeton, Harvard,

01:18:08.769 --> 01:18:11.730
Dartmouth, MIT, Brown.

01:18:21.281 --> 01:18:22.574
Well done.

01:18:23.617 --> 01:18:24.785
Thank you.

01:18:25.369 --> 01:18:26.620
It's very impressive.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:34.544
I guess. Yeah.

01:18:37.589 --> 01:18:40.258
All this time you've been deceiving me?

01:18:43.053 --> 01:18:45.013
- What? No.
- I took you to the library,

01:18:45.097 --> 01:18:48.100
and you snuck around behind
my back taking SAT tests

01:18:48.225 --> 01:18:51.144
- and contacting universities?
- Dad, it's not like that.

01:18:51.269 --> 01:18:52.646
We're not an accredited home school,

01:18:52.771 --> 01:18:54.731
I don't know how the fuck you did it.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.526
- I guess you somehow...
- You don't understand.

01:18:57.609 --> 01:19:00.112
...managed to create acceptable
transcripts, got your work approved.

01:19:00.237 --> 01:19:01.279
Listen.

01:19:01.405 --> 01:19:02.614
All without my knowledge and approval.

01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:03.740
Listen, Dad, please.

01:19:03.824 --> 01:19:05.200
I don't know what's more impressive.

01:19:05.283 --> 01:19:06.952
The fact that you got into
all these fine schools

01:19:07.077 --> 01:19:10.455
or that for months you've been
lying directly to my face.

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:11.915
It was Mom.

01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:20.632
She helped me with everything.
We did it together.

01:19:23.135 --> 01:19:25.804
- I just want to go to college.
- You speak six languages!

01:19:25.929 --> 01:19:27.389
You have high math, theoretical physics!

01:19:27.472 --> 01:19:28.890
Dad! But this is what I'm talking about!

01:19:28.974 --> 01:19:30.225
What the hell are these
people going to teach you?

01:19:30.308 --> 01:19:32.018
I know nothing!

01:19:32.144 --> 01:19:35.772
I know nothing!
I am a freak because of you!

01:19:35.981 --> 01:19:38.483
You made us freaks!

01:19:38.608 --> 01:19:40.485
And Mom knew that! She understood!

01:19:41.653 --> 01:19:46.658
Unless it comes out of a fucking book,
I don't know anything about anything!

01:20:12.017 --> 01:20:13.018
Dad?

01:20:15.145 --> 01:20:16.396
You should put some clothes on, buddy.

01:20:29.201 --> 01:20:31.995
No, stay on Steve. I'll be right back.

01:20:37.834 --> 01:20:39.127
- Where is he?
- No.

01:20:39.211 --> 01:20:40.295
Abby, I need Rell.

01:20:40.378 --> 01:20:41.421
It won't work like this, you know Jack.

01:20:41.546 --> 01:20:42.547
He's my son.

01:20:46.218 --> 01:20:47.427
All right.

01:20:48.887 --> 01:20:51.389
It's all about timing. Just be easy.

01:20:54.059 --> 01:20:55.393
Follow through.

01:21:00.065 --> 01:21:02.526
- Okay, get your things.
- Just a minute, please.

01:21:02.609 --> 01:21:03.860
Come on, Rell.

01:21:04.277 --> 01:21:05.946
I said, just a minute.

01:21:06.738 --> 01:21:09.533
I've clearly upset you and I apologize.

01:21:09.616 --> 01:21:11.076
You killed Mom!

01:21:11.159 --> 01:21:12.244
Oh.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.921
I heard you.

01:21:24.923 --> 01:21:26.424
I heard you fighting about where we live.

01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:29.427
Mom wanted to leave. I heard.

01:21:30.595 --> 01:21:33.431
Your mother and I made
certain decisions, together,

01:21:33.515 --> 01:21:34.849
about what was best for all of you.

01:21:34.933 --> 01:21:37.936
I'm going to live here
with Nana and Grandpa.

01:21:38.353 --> 01:21:42.941
That's not possible.
Come on, get your stuff. Let's go.

01:21:45.777 --> 01:21:46.778
Let's go!

01:21:47.779 --> 01:21:51.199
I hate you! I fucking hate you!

01:21:51.283 --> 01:21:52.284
Rellian.

01:21:54.953 --> 01:21:56.204
Rellian.

01:22:02.377 --> 01:22:04.713
What the fuck? That almost hit me!

01:22:04.796 --> 01:22:06.715
If I wanted to hit you,
I would have hit you.

01:22:06.798 --> 01:22:08.049
You just shot an arrow at me!

01:22:08.133 --> 01:22:10.218
You told me they were in school.

01:22:13.054 --> 01:22:14.306
They are.

01:22:15.056 --> 01:22:16.391
Leslie and I are their teachers.

01:22:16.474 --> 01:22:17.976
Are... Were their teachers.

01:22:18.059 --> 01:22:20.061
So you're teaching them to steal?

01:22:20.145 --> 01:22:21.146
Of course not.

01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:22.981
"Mission: Free the Food"?

01:22:24.816 --> 01:22:26.568
That was part of their training.

01:22:26.651 --> 01:22:28.653
So you're training them to steal?

01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:32.115
Their mother had just died.

01:22:32.324 --> 01:22:35.827
They were in shock, they were devastated,
they needed a distraction.

01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:37.329
So we made it Noam Chomsky Day.

01:22:37.454 --> 01:22:38.913
"Noam Chomsky Day."

01:22:38.997 --> 01:22:40.415
I don't even know who that is.

01:22:40.498 --> 01:22:43.627
That's the day you gave
my grandchildren real weapons.

01:22:46.671 --> 01:22:48.673
How did Rellian break his hand?

01:22:51.343 --> 01:22:54.929
He slip... He fell. And it's not broken.

01:22:55.013 --> 01:22:57.098
He was climbing
on a rock face in the rain.

01:22:57.182 --> 01:22:58.767
It was an accident.

01:22:58.850 --> 01:23:00.518
And it wasn't raining
when we were climbing.

01:23:00.644 --> 01:23:02.604
He has bruises over his whole body.

01:23:02.687 --> 01:23:04.939
Yeah, and scratches. We all have them.

01:23:05.023 --> 01:23:06.107
It's child abuse.

01:23:06.191 --> 01:23:09.194
Even if they make it through whatever
it is you're doing to them,

01:23:09.277 --> 01:23:12.113
they're going to be totally unprepared
for the real world.

01:23:12.197 --> 01:23:14.491
And I happen to think
the opposite is true.

01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:20.705
Rellian is legally old enough to choose,
and I intend to honor his wishes.

01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:27.712
This is my lawyer's card.

01:23:29.130 --> 01:23:31.299
Abby and I have decided
that we're going to file

01:23:31.383 --> 01:23:33.301
for custody of the children.

01:23:33.385 --> 01:23:34.719
Now, I know you don't own a telephone,

01:23:34.844 --> 01:23:37.889
but I suggest you find one
immediately and call him.

01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:41.226
Because I would hate to have
to issue a warrant for your arrest.

01:23:41.309 --> 01:23:42.727
He's my son.

01:23:43.353 --> 01:23:45.355
I'm not leaving without him, Jack.

01:23:45.814 --> 01:23:47.023
Fine.

01:23:51.736 --> 01:23:55.365
Who's this? Hey, hello, Bill, how are you?

01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:59.327
It's Jack Bertrang from up in Coronado.

01:23:59.411 --> 01:24:03.164
Listen, I think I just saw a prowler
wandering around outside on my grounds.

01:24:03.248 --> 01:24:06.376
I wonder if you'd send a car.
Thanks. Yeah.

01:24:08.586 --> 01:24:13.091
I hope you can explain Rellian's
injuries to the police, because I can't.

01:24:33.528 --> 01:24:35.739
- Yes, thanks very much.
- Sure thing, Mr. Bertrang.

01:24:47.542 --> 01:24:50.879
Okay, prisoner located.

01:24:50.962 --> 01:24:54.048
Second floor, second window,
above the garage.

01:24:57.385 --> 01:24:58.511
Target locked.

01:24:59.471 --> 01:25:00.638
Bring him home, Vesp.

01:26:25.974 --> 01:26:27.058
Dad!

01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:28.977
- Vespyr!
- Dad!

01:26:29.936 --> 01:26:32.355
- Vespyr!
- Dad!

01:26:56.546 --> 01:26:58.214
Mr. Cash?

01:27:05.847 --> 01:27:08.516
She's got a decent concussion,
but we did a CAT scan,

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.435
and there's absolutely
no damage to the brain.

01:27:10.852 --> 01:27:14.397
She does have a slight fracture across
the tibia and fibula of her left leg.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.276
She's going to need a neck brace
and a cast, but otherwise she's fine.

01:27:18.818 --> 01:27:20.236
Can I show you something?

01:27:20.945 --> 01:27:23.489
Uh, this is the top vertebrae here.

01:27:23.823 --> 01:27:27.160
This dark line, it's hard to see,
but that's the fracture line.

01:27:28.411 --> 01:27:30.121
What was she doing on a roof?

01:27:32.665 --> 01:27:34.751
Just playing.

01:27:35.710 --> 01:27:37.545
Well, for a girl her age,
she's unusually strong.

01:27:38.421 --> 01:27:39.464
Yeah.

01:27:39.547 --> 01:27:40.965
There's seven vertebrae in the neck.

01:27:41.049 --> 01:27:44.177
A break to any of the first four,
a tear to the spinal cord...

01:27:44.594 --> 01:27:48.014
I mean, if this had happened
just a few millimeters lower,

01:27:49.223 --> 01:27:51.768
we'd be talking about death or paralysis.

01:27:54.771 --> 01:27:56.773
You're a very lucky man.

01:28:05.573 --> 01:28:07.408
- Hey, guys, come on in.
- Aw, please come in.

01:28:07.533 --> 01:28:09.452
- Hi!
- Hi, sweetheart.

01:28:09.827 --> 01:28:10.954
Come right in, darling.

01:28:11.037 --> 01:28:12.705
Let me have your bag. Come on, honey.

01:28:12.789 --> 01:28:13.957
Slow down, now.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.166
Slow down.

01:28:15.249 --> 01:28:17.377
Let's go this way, darling.
This way, honey.

01:28:17.585 --> 01:28:18.878
We're going to go right into the kitchen.

01:28:18.962 --> 01:28:21.673
Come on, let's get you
something to eat, okay?

01:28:21.756 --> 01:28:23.633
You'll have a good night's sleep.

01:28:24.008 --> 01:28:25.093
Okay?

01:28:46.072 --> 01:28:47.740
- One.
- One.

01:28:47.865 --> 01:28:49.617
- Two.
- Two.

01:28:50.368 --> 01:28:51.869
Three.

01:28:52.537 --> 01:28:53.788
- Four.
- Four.

01:28:53.871 --> 01:28:55.164
And then you go back, five.

01:28:55.248 --> 01:28:56.416
- Five.
- Like here.

01:28:56.541 --> 01:28:58.001
And you jump up and clap your hands.

01:28:58.084 --> 01:28:59.585
- Six.
- Six.

01:29:03.464 --> 01:29:06.718
- Grandfather abuse.
- Grandpa down!

01:29:13.099 --> 01:29:14.642
There's a lot in here, honey.

01:29:14.726 --> 01:29:16.644
I want you to take whatever you want.

01:29:18.062 --> 01:29:20.273
There's something I did want to show you.

01:29:21.774 --> 01:29:25.778
Just before you called about getting
her treatment, she sent me two letters.

01:29:25.903 --> 01:29:27.947
And I wanted to show this one to you.

01:29:32.326 --> 01:29:36.748
"Dear Mom, you don't need
to come get me anymore."

01:29:37.915 --> 01:29:39.625
"Burn the other letter."

01:29:45.256 --> 01:29:47.008
"What Ben and I have created here"

01:29:47.091 --> 01:29:49.802
"may be unique in all of human existence."

01:29:51.095 --> 01:29:54.182
"We created a paradise
out of Plato's Republic."

01:29:55.933 --> 01:29:58.603
"Our children shall be philosopher kings."

01:30:00.646 --> 01:30:03.775
"It makes me so indescribably happy."

01:30:05.443 --> 01:30:07.153
"I'm going to get better out here."

01:30:07.278 --> 01:30:08.529
"I know I will."

01:30:09.155 --> 01:30:11.866
"Because we are defined by our actions,"

01:30:11.949 --> 01:30:13.659
"not our words."

01:30:40.144 --> 01:30:41.813
Like, not going home?

01:30:45.108 --> 01:30:46.317
Yeah.

01:30:48.319 --> 01:30:49.862
Like not going home.

01:30:51.114 --> 01:30:53.157
I am not staying here.

01:30:53.324 --> 01:30:55.743
This house is a vulgar display of wealth.

01:30:55.827 --> 01:30:58.204
And an unethical use of space.

01:31:00.665 --> 01:31:02.500
I think you'll all be safe here.

01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:04.001
But we want to live with you.

01:31:04.127 --> 01:31:05.878
I almost got you killed, sweetie.

01:31:06.712 --> 01:31:08.131
It was an accident.

01:31:08.214 --> 01:31:10.007
The tiles just cracked.

01:31:22.687 --> 01:31:26.399
It's a beautiful mistake.

01:31:28.025 --> 01:31:29.527
But a mistake.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.327
I thought it would help her.
I... I thought...

01:31:43.583 --> 01:31:45.751
I thought she'd get better
out there, you know?

01:31:45.877 --> 01:31:47.211
But, uh...

01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:54.260
But it was too much.

01:31:55.386 --> 01:31:57.889
It was too much. Too much, uh...

01:31:59.015 --> 01:32:00.016
And I knew it.

01:32:03.769 --> 01:32:05.021
I did.

01:32:08.608 --> 01:32:09.901
I knew.

01:32:23.748 --> 01:32:25.458
Why can't we just stay with you?

01:32:29.086 --> 01:32:31.088
Because if you do,

01:32:33.299 --> 01:32:34.926
I'll ruin your lives.

01:32:44.393 --> 01:32:45.937
I'll call you in a few days.

01:33:12.630 --> 01:33:14.131
You know where you're heading?

01:33:18.844 --> 01:33:19.971
So?

01:33:39.949 --> 01:33:42.868
I don't know.
Maybe you could take them hunting.

01:33:42.994 --> 01:33:44.078
They...

01:33:44.161 --> 01:33:45.413
They all like that.

01:33:45.496 --> 01:33:47.373
- Okay.
- And, uh...

01:33:48.374 --> 01:33:50.126
Bo wants to go to college.

01:33:51.002 --> 01:33:53.212
He got in everywhere.
All the best schools.

01:33:54.839 --> 01:33:56.674
I don't really know how we're
going to pay for all that.

01:33:56.799 --> 01:33:59.510
Ben, I'll take care of it.

01:34:00.136 --> 01:34:02.013
We're going to look after your children.

01:34:02.972 --> 01:34:05.850
There's really nothing
to worry about, I promise.

01:34:07.852 --> 01:34:09.812
You're doing the right thing.

01:34:16.569 --> 01:34:18.362
Okay, well...

01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:25.703
Good luck, Ben.

01:34:26.829 --> 01:34:28.080
Thanks.

01:37:03.736 --> 01:37:05.362
You shaved your face.

01:37:20.586 --> 01:37:22.213
I don't hate you.

01:37:25.883 --> 01:37:27.593
I just wish you'd helped Mom.

01:37:47.863 --> 01:37:49.240
Me, too.

01:38:01.377 --> 01:38:02.628
I'm sorry.

01:38:04.588 --> 01:38:06.048
I love you.

01:38:17.268 --> 01:38:18.602
We want to complete the mission.

01:38:19.103 --> 01:38:21.564
No. There's no mission.

01:38:21.647 --> 01:38:24.358
Mission: Rescue Dad and Mommy.

01:38:24.441 --> 01:38:25.693
Mom wanted to be cremated.

01:38:25.776 --> 01:38:27.611
And we want to honor her wishes.

01:38:27.736 --> 01:38:29.238
And flush her down the toilet.

01:38:30.656 --> 01:38:35.578
I can't put any of you
in danger ever again.

01:38:36.287 --> 01:38:37.746
I'm sorry.

01:38:38.289 --> 01:38:40.374
"If you assume that there is no hope,"

01:38:40.457 --> 01:38:42.626
"then you guarantee
that there will be no hope."

01:38:43.294 --> 01:38:45.629
"If you assume that there is
an instinct for freedom,"

01:38:46.171 --> 01:38:48.465
"that there are opportunities
to change things,"

01:38:50.301 --> 01:38:53.429
"then there is a possibility that you can
contribute to making a better world."

01:38:55.764 --> 01:38:57.266
Noam Chomsky.

01:39:33.761 --> 01:39:35.387
Dad, I found her.

01:39:56.533 --> 01:39:58.494
"Leslie Abigail Cash."

01:39:58.827 --> 01:40:02.164
"May God bless her soul for all eternity."

01:40:02.665 --> 01:40:04.041
Let's dig!

01:40:04.124 --> 01:40:06.835
Otherwise she has to lie
under that bullshit forever.

01:40:36.490 --> 01:40:38.117
Mommy's in here.

01:43:21.822 --> 01:43:23.490
Hi, little bird.

01:43:25.075 --> 01:43:26.410
It's me.

01:43:28.453 --> 01:43:29.788
And I'm sorry.

01:43:30.789 --> 01:43:32.916
I didn't know what to do.

01:43:34.501 --> 01:43:36.753
I'm sorry if I made it worse.

01:43:47.264 --> 01:43:51.935
My face is mine, my hands are mine.

01:43:53.604 --> 01:43:57.065
My mouth is mine.

01:44:02.404 --> 01:44:05.490
But I'm not. I'm yours.

01:44:53.872 --> 01:44:55.165
Mom, here's your favorite song.

01:45:06.718 --> 01:45:11.640
She's got a smile that it seems to me

01:45:11.723 --> 01:45:15.769
Reminds me of childhood memories

01:45:15.852 --> 01:45:19.106
Where everything was as fresh

01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:22.859
As the bright, blue sky

01:45:28.865 --> 01:45:30.117
Now and then

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.744
When I see her face

01:45:32.869 --> 01:45:38.125
She takes me away to that special place

01:45:38.208 --> 01:45:42.087
And if I stare too long

01:45:42.212 --> 01:45:44.923
I'll probably break down and cry

01:45:50.012 --> 01:45:52.806
Oh, oh, oh

01:45:52.889 --> 01:45:56.727
Sweet child o' mine

01:46:00.439 --> 01:46:03.066
Oh, oh, oh

01:46:03.358 --> 01:46:06.278
Sweet love of

01:46:07.237 --> 01:46:08.238
Mine

01:46:15.037 --> 01:46:18.040
She's got eyes of the bluest skies

01:46:18.123 --> 01:46:22.169
As if they thought of rain

01:46:22.252 --> 01:46:25.839
I'd hate to look into those eyes

01:46:25.922 --> 01:46:29.092
And see an ounce of pain

01:46:30.302 --> 01:46:33.346
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place

01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:37.350
Where as a child I'd hide

01:46:37.434 --> 01:46:41.229
And pray for the thunder and the rain

01:46:41.313 --> 01:46:44.441
To quietly pass me by

01:46:45.901 --> 01:46:47.694
Oh, oh, oh

01:46:47.778 --> 01:46:50.113
Sweet child o' mine

01:46:52.282 --> 01:46:55.744
Say oh, oh, oh

01:47:01.124 --> 01:47:06.004
Sweet child o' mine

01:47:08.381 --> 01:47:13.386
Sweet love o' mine

01:47:16.306 --> 01:47:19.643
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet

01:47:20.143 --> 01:47:23.563
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet

01:47:24.106 --> 01:47:28.151
Sweet love o' mine

01:47:31.738 --> 01:47:35.325
- Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
- Sweet love o' mine

01:47:35.408 --> 01:47:39.246
- Sweet, sweet, oh, sweet
- Sweet love o' mine

01:47:39.329 --> 01:47:45.418
Sweet, sweet, sweet love o' mine

01:47:47.003 --> 01:47:50.674
- Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
- Sweet love o' mine

01:47:50.799 --> 01:47:54.427
- Sweet, sweet, oh, sweet
- Sweet child o' mine

01:47:54.678 --> 01:47:58.348
Sweet, sweet, sweet child o' mine

01:48:00.183 --> 01:48:02.269
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

01:48:02.435 --> 01:48:06.106
- Sweet child, sweet child
- Sweet child o' mine

01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:10.026
Sweet child, oh, sweet

01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:11.862
Sweet child

01:48:12.112 --> 01:48:14.698
Sweet child of mine

01:48:17.534 --> 01:48:19.119
Goodbye, Mommy!

01:48:22.998 --> 01:48:25.500
- I love you all, okay?
- We love you.

01:48:29.379 --> 01:48:31.298
Why are you going to Namibia?

01:48:31.464 --> 01:48:33.216
I just put my finger on a map.

01:48:43.518 --> 01:48:48.064
When you have sex with a woman,
be gentle and listen to her.

01:48:50.025 --> 01:48:52.777
Treat her with respect and dignity,
even if you don't love her.

01:48:52.861 --> 01:48:54.321
I know.

01:48:54.404 --> 01:48:55.947
Always tell the truth.

01:48:56.031 --> 01:48:57.949
Always take the high road.

01:48:58.033 --> 01:48:59.492
I know.

01:48:59.576 --> 01:49:01.620
Live each day like it could be your last.

01:49:02.078 --> 01:49:03.371
Drink it in.

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:07.667
Be adventurous, be bold,
but savor it. It goes fast.

01:49:08.752 --> 01:49:09.961
I know.

01:49:12.547 --> 01:49:13.924
Don't die.

01:49:16.718 --> 01:49:17.928
I won't.

01:49:35.612 --> 01:49:37.155
Get out of here.

01:49:52.712 --> 01:49:54.005
Power to the people.

01:49:54.422 --> 01:49:55.840
Stick it to the man.

01:50:29.124 --> 01:50:30.667
Hey, guys!

01:51:21.468 --> 01:51:22.969
Okay, eat your breakfast.

01:51:23.053 --> 01:51:24.804
The school bus will be here in 15 minutes.
