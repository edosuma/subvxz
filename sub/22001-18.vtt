WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.361
My God.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.698
-I-I-I weep for our future.
-Pathetic.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.333
When did Ben get a phone?

00:32.366 --> 00:34.001
I upgraded mine,
so I gave him my old one.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.870
No. Absolutely not.
I didn't sign off on that.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.872
Hey, that's mine.

00:38.906 --> 00:40.108
Not anymore.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.042
(gasps) What the hell
is wrong with you?

00:42.076 --> 00:44.378
-I don't like it.
-Phones?

00:44.412 --> 00:46.580
Uh, phones, computers,
the-the pads,

00:46.614 --> 00:48.015
the cloud, you know,
the Internet.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.584
-N-None of it. I don't like it.
-You sound senile.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.453
All right, well, if living
in the real world is senile,

00:52.486 --> 00:53.687
then I am Liza Minnelli.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.888
(scoffs) Real world blows.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.391
I can't wait till I'm hooked up
to an I.V. drip

00:57.425 --> 00:59.427
just hammering
VR porn stars 24/7.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.694
ALBA:
Ah, Chip.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.063
You don't mean that.
The world is full of excitement.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.465
Just look around you.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.566
Oh, yeah, like what?

01:05.599 --> 01:07.067
Oh, like, uh...

01:07.101 --> 01:10.104
Oh, politics and pranks, uh,
celebrity interviews,

01:10.138 --> 01:12.373
-cooking competitions.
-What are you doing?

01:12.406 --> 01:13.641
You're just naming stuff on TV.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.110
Listen, guys, it's a
beautiful day. Let's go outside.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.111
Yeah, right. It's, like,

01:17.145 --> 01:18.646
a thousand frickin'
degrees outside.

01:18.679 --> 01:22.082
And God forbid we feel something
or have a human interaction.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.051
I have human interactions
all the time.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.154
Later today, I'm meeting up
with some guy I met online.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.422
-(chuckles) Probably a nerd.
-Or a pervert.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.590
He's neither, actually.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.325
He's a sick tattoo artist
and he's coming over

01:31.359 --> 01:32.793
to give me some fresh new ink.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.462
Are you sure he's not
a sick new murderer

01:34.495 --> 01:36.564
coming over to turn
your skin into a cape?

01:36.597 --> 01:38.065
Yeah, you know,
maybe Mickey's right.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.933
I feel like the whole point
of the Internet

01:39.967 --> 01:41.335
is so you don't
have to meet people.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.471
You know, you can just live your
whole life inside a computer.

01:43.504 --> 01:46.240
No. That wasn't the point
I was making at all.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.576
Th-The point is,
put your phones down.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.944
Look up, get outside,
have an experience.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.780
Getting a tattoo
is an experience.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.849
I don't know, I'm thinking maybe
a power fist with nail polish.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.651
Yes, please put that
on your body forever.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.119
Found her.

01:59.153 --> 02:00.588
-Found who?
-My car.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.356
Thought she got stolen,
turns out she's at the impound.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.357
Want to come?

02:03.391 --> 02:05.459
Yes, I do.
You're coming with me, Ben.

02:05.493 --> 02:08.296
Let's get out of here before
these two get chopped to bits

02:08.329 --> 02:09.763
-by some nerd pervert.
-Yeah.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.299
Yeah, right.
A day with you

02:11.332 --> 02:14.868
is way more dangerous
than anything online.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.837
MICKEY:
Ugh, it's hot as hell out here.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.106
Yeah, my shorts are pulling up.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.509
Why are we even here, Jimmy?
Just buy a new car.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.877
Or we got a whole fleet
of luxury vehicles at home.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.480
Yeah, I don't need a new car.
Mine runs just fine.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.849
Got a thousand memories
in the ol' Blue Magoose.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.151
My memories consist mostly
of you running me over with it.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.986
You don't put something
out to pasture

02:33.020 --> 02:34.455
when it's still
in its prime, okay?

02:34.488 --> 02:37.157
Now, I know she may not look it,
but this kitty can still--

02:37.191 --> 02:39.560
Whoa!

02:39.593 --> 02:41.295
MICKEY:
What are you doing?

02:41.329 --> 02:43.231
-Yo, Officer, is this for sale?
-Everything's for sale.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.966
She is a beaut,
tell you that much.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.969
-How many miles we working with?
-273,000.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.871
Still, that price
can't be right. Only 900 bucks?

02:50.904 --> 02:52.840
I mean, what's the catch?

02:52.873 --> 02:55.343
I'm thinking these bullet holes
have something to do with it.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.444
You would be correct.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.050
ALBA:
Chip, can I...?

03:03.083 --> 03:05.853
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Nothing. Beat it.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.389
-Hey, stop! That's private.
-What is this?

03:08.422 --> 03:09.523
Nothing.
I make doodles sometimes.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.724
That was a doodle I did.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.427
Oh, well, this doodle
looks very similar

03:13.461 --> 03:15.062
to a tattoo Sabrina described.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.830
(scoffs) Nah.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.766
-Nah?
-(weakly): Nah.

03:18.799 --> 03:23.103
Well, I think yes.
I think something smells fishy.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.239
Well, I think
you're an idiot, so...

03:25.273 --> 03:27.174
Eh, maybe.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.609
I'll go see what Sabrina thinks.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.844
No! Fine! Okay, just... (sighs)

03:30.878 --> 03:33.080
Promise me that you
will not tell Sabrina.

03:33.113 --> 03:36.049
Oh, I already like where this
is going. Okay. Let's go.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.185
(sighs)

03:38.218 --> 03:40.788
I am Sabrina's tattoo artist.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.757
Marcus Lella, Ink Well Boston.
I made him up.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.360
You catfish your sister?

03:46.394 --> 03:48.429
No. What? What is wrong
with you? Ew.

03:48.462 --> 03:51.432
Um, I made a fake profile to get
closer to her friend Holly.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.601
I just want to find out,
you know, her likes,

03:53.634 --> 03:55.202
-her interests,
what turns her on.
-Uh-huh.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.370
Anything I can use.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.771
Creepy.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.239
I made a bunch
of different personas,

03:59.273 --> 04:01.909
but Marcus is the one that just
really, really broke through.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.311
-Hmm.
-Beautiful black man,

04:03.344 --> 04:05.646
silver tongue,
a million fake followers.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.948
Oh. (chuckles)

04:07.981 --> 04:09.149
This is delicious.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.819
Oh, Sabrina is gonna destroy you
when she finds out.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.721
Yeah, okay.
She's not gonna find out

04:13.754 --> 04:15.289
'cause Marcus
is gonna die of AIDS.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.390
-Wh-What?
-Yeah.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.458
My cover's basically blown.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.226
I told her the only days
I was available

04:19.259 --> 04:21.895
was the days that she was out
of town. She cancels her trip.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.764
Now I have to give her
a tattoo today.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.299
But why AIDS?

04:25.333 --> 04:27.134
It makes sense.
He's a baller tattoo artist.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.236
He works with needles
and he gets laid a lot.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.104
Okay, Chip. No.
You can't kill this guy.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.840
It is too good.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.409
Pay me $200 and I will help you
keep Marcus alive.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.911
Nope. No, thanks. Go.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.413
Let me rephrase that.

04:39.447 --> 04:42.950
For $200 I won't tell Sabrina
that you are Marcus.

04:45.686 --> 04:49.323
JIMMY:
Yeah!

04:49.357 --> 04:51.525
Ben, feel that rumble
in your balls?

04:51.559 --> 04:53.293
-It kind of hurts.
-Yeah?

04:53.327 --> 04:56.096
-They'll toughen up
once you work 'em over.
-Okay.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.331
That'll do with the ball talk.

04:57.365 --> 04:58.699
Can we get back
on the highway, please?

04:58.732 --> 05:01.168
I'm telling you, Mick.
You should take the wheel.

05:01.201 --> 05:05.138
-This broad can really salsa.
-I don't know what that means.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.974
Well, if you were feeling
what I'm feeling,

05:07.007 --> 05:08.208
you'd know
exactly what it means.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.110
If we switch places,
will you stop talking?

05:10.143 --> 05:12.145
-I'd consider it.
-Okay. Pull over.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.414
Mm-hmm.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.656
-Now, she can be a little nasty
coming out of first.
-Yeah.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.526
-So you're gonna want to be
gentle but also firm.
-Right.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.499
-It's locked.
-This one, too.

05:31.532 --> 05:34.301
Ben. Little help.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.770
It's locked.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.243
Oh, good.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.819
Where are we,
the surface of the sun?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.320
-Am I in danger?
-What?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.988
No. No, no, no, no, no.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.657
You're good. We're just
playing a little game.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.492
-What's the game?
-Eh...

05:58.526 --> 06:00.327
Uh, cops and criminals.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.995
We're the cops,
you're the criminal.

06:02.029 --> 06:06.333
-What did I do?
-Well, fire stuff, obviously.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.536
Right? You, uh,
you burned down a high-rise

06:08.569 --> 06:10.671
and collected
the insurance money. You...

06:10.704 --> 06:12.940
Yeah, then you took out 40 cops
trying to escape.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.408
-Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-(imitates gunfire)

06:14.442 --> 06:15.843
Yeah, yeah. That'll do.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.945
So, should we grab, like, a rock
and start-start smashing or...

06:17.978 --> 06:19.112
Oh, no, no, no, no.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.682
You're not smashing her.
She's brand-new.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.217
This thing has
270,000 miles on it.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.786
She's probably unsmashable.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.254
I mean, this thing's
built like a tank.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.622
Okay, so what do you want to do?

06:28.656 --> 06:30.223
You just want to sit back
and watch him cook

06:30.257 --> 06:31.792
-like a bunny in a microwave?
-No, of course not.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.294
One of us should probably
huff it into the town

06:34.327 --> 06:35.529
and get a hanger.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.197
It's built like a tank,

06:37.230 --> 06:39.299
but you can get into it
with a coat hanger?

06:39.332 --> 06:41.134
I get it. Okay, you know what?

06:41.168 --> 06:42.970
Why don't you just sit here

06:43.003 --> 06:45.606
and keep looking pretty,
Your Majesty,

06:45.639 --> 06:47.808
while I fix the problem?

06:47.841 --> 06:50.978
Take care of my baby,
and Ben, too.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.816
Good luck, Bear Grylls.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.151
Okay, buddy. Time to smash.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.290
All right, buddy, scoot over

07:03.323 --> 07:05.225
and duck.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.828
(screaming)

07:12.466 --> 07:14.468
Ow!

07:14.502 --> 07:16.436
Oh, boy.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.638
(groans)

07:17.671 --> 07:19.072
Are you okay?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.441
I'm okay.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.812
Fun game!

07:24.845 --> 07:26.914
(whimpers)

07:26.947 --> 07:30.183
Sabrina, I want to talk to you
about your friend Marcus.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.185
You mean the guy
Chip's pretending to be online?

07:32.219 --> 07:33.787
Wha-- You already knew this?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.489
Yeah, he left his laptop open.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.525
And no black guy
says "frickin'" that much.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.927
So, uh, why do you keep
talking to him?

07:39.960 --> 07:40.994
'Cause I'm trying to back him
into a corner

07:41.028 --> 07:42.530
and force him to confess.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.665
But the dude just keeps doubling
down. It's crazy.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.099
What if I told you
there was a way

07:46.133 --> 07:47.968
you could completely
destroy him?

07:48.001 --> 07:49.336
Obviously, I'd be interested.

07:49.369 --> 07:52.506
Then I will tell you for $200.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.642
Yeah. No, thanks.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.276
I'll stick to my original plan.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.045
Oh, okay. I understand.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.480
I-I'm just gonna go tell Chip
to get out before it's too late.

08:00.514 --> 08:05.318
All right, Alba.
Come on. Fine.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.254
(sighs)
Here.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.628
Okay. Holly is the key.

08:14.662 --> 08:17.297
Chip created Marcus
to get to her.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.799
-Holly?
-Mm.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.669
Come on. Are you serious?
But she's so lame.

08:21.702 --> 08:25.405
Well, you must out Chip
in front of her.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.140
Yeah, I mean,
that'll destroy him for sure.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.043
I'm into it, but... I-I just
can't wrap my head around

08:30.077 --> 08:31.411
this Holly thing.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.914
It's like, I have
way hotter friends.

08:35.949 --> 08:39.086
I'm enough. I'm in shape.

08:39.119 --> 08:43.023
I have a good body.
I'm a good boy.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.692
-MAN: Excuse me.
-Oh?

08:46.894 --> 08:48.562
You snuck up on me there, guy.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.164
Yeah, sorry. These electric cars
run pretty quiet.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.166
You look like you could use
some help.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.269
Hey, why won't you do me a favor
and go look somewhere else?

08:56.303 --> 08:58.438
You sure?
It's, uh, pretty hot out.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.007
Yeah, I'm sure, Mr. Robot.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.942
Go ahead and drive
your little golf car

09:01.975 --> 09:03.977
back to the future.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.315
I'm an American man.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.754
Hey, Chip. Great news.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.422
-You threw her off my scent?
-Nah.

09:15.455 --> 09:16.456
I'm still working on that.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.458
But also, Holly is downstairs.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.227
What? W-Why? Why?

09:20.260 --> 09:22.630
I-I don't know.
But hey, I get it, man.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.864
She's very pretty.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.799
No. This is not good.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.735
I got to get out of here.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.202
No, hey. What are you
talking about?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.570
The whole point was
to get Holly here,

09:30.604 --> 09:32.072
-and now she's here.
-No.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.874
-I got to kill him right now.
-Ay, no. Chip.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.276
Forget about Marcus.
You are Marcus.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.879
Marcus is a very ripped,
handsome black man.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.648
Okay, listen. Sure, sure,

09:40.681 --> 09:42.549
his looks got her in the door,

09:42.582 --> 09:44.584
but she stayed for you.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.554
You know, she liked your words.
She laughed at your jokes.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.289
-You know what?
-Yeah.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.392
Maybe you're right.
This is my moment.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.827
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.462
You know, the table is set.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.665
All you have to do is
sit down and eat.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.633
I'm gonna frickin' feast.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.903
Ah, yeah.
Such a loser.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.906
(grunting)
Come on, you bastard.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.275
Come on.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.910
Open for me, you bitch.

10:09.943 --> 10:13.480
Open sesame. Come on!

10:13.513 --> 10:17.918
Ah, you stupid, stupid machine!

10:17.951 --> 10:19.853
(panting)

10:21.388 --> 10:22.856
Aunt Mickey, I'm bored.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.858
Can we play a different game?

10:24.892 --> 10:27.661
Yeah. You got it, bud.

10:27.695 --> 10:31.431
Just give me a second to gather
my thoughts, okay?

10:31.464 --> 10:34.501
(grunting)

10:34.534 --> 10:37.938
Ah. (laughs) I did it.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.973
I did this.

10:40.007 --> 10:43.010
I penetrated
the impenetrable machine!

10:43.043 --> 10:46.513
I'm a hero! I save lives!

10:46.546 --> 10:48.615
(laughs hysterically)

10:48.648 --> 10:50.150
Oh, yes!

10:50.183 --> 10:51.685
Stand back, buddy, okay?

10:51.719 --> 10:54.154
Coming in the back door.
Hang on.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.023
-Here we go. You standing back?
-BEN: Uh-huh!

10:56.056 --> 10:58.458
Look out, I'm on my way.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.559
Blasting through.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.561
(grunting)

11:05.699 --> 11:06.700
Damn it.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.001
BEN:
Uh, Aunt Mickey?

11:08.035 --> 11:09.737
Are you in the trunk?

11:09.770 --> 11:13.506
Yes, Ben. Yes, I am.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.245
BEN: Aunt Mickey,
are you still there?

11:18.278 --> 11:19.980
Yep.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.817
Just reflecting on all the
choices that landed me here.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.886
-(phone chiming)
-What was that?

11:25.919 --> 11:27.587
-What was that noise?
-Oh, it's your phone.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.023
My phone? Can you see it?
Who is it? Is it help?

11:30.057 --> 11:31.925
(chiming)

11:31.959 --> 11:34.261
Your wireless bill is past due.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.997
I know it is! It always is!

11:37.030 --> 11:39.867
Okay, Ben, we got to get that
phone. It's our only hope.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.101
-Move out of the way.
-Why?

11:41.134 --> 11:44.671
'Cause I'm coming in.
(grunting)

11:44.704 --> 11:46.106
Hey, guys. Don't mind me.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.574
I'm just grabbing
an alkaline water.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.843
Just finished
a brutal Pilates sesh.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.044
You do Pilates?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.679
No, he does not.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.082
You don't know what I do
and what I don't do.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.684
-(exhales)
-I mean, I love Pilates, too.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.286
-Really? But you've...
-Mm-hmm.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.755
...you got such
a lean, toned body.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.191
Well, yeah,
it's 'cause of the Pilates.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.625
-(both chuckle)
-Right.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.260
Kind of like the classic
chicken and egg sitch.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.695
What came first?

12:08.728 --> 12:11.398
Body or the Pilates,
Pilates or the body?

12:11.431 --> 12:12.565
-Dear God.
-(laughs)

12:12.599 --> 12:13.767
-You're funny.
-Uh...

12:13.801 --> 12:15.102
You're the one
telling the jokes.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.303
-Right. I'm funny, too.
-(laughs)

12:16.336 --> 12:18.205
We have a lot in common.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.107
I can't handle this anymore.
I'm gonna explode his ass.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.541
Wait, no, no, no.
Wait, you can't do that.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.210
-Why not?
-Well, don't you get it?

12:23.243 --> 12:24.611
He's starting
to climb the mountain.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.279
The higher he gets,
the harder he will fall.

12:26.313 --> 12:27.647
Don't you want him to fall hard?

12:27.680 --> 12:28.748
-Yes. Yes, I want that.
-Okay.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.217
-Yeah.
-All right, fine.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.919
-We'll let him dig himself
a little deeper.
-Yeah.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.586
-(doorbell rings)
-You know what?

12:33.620 --> 12:35.288
I'm gonna get that because
I'm the man of the house,

12:35.322 --> 12:37.324
but it's been really cool
talking to you.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.525
Yeah.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.761
Hey, is Sabrina home?

12:41.795 --> 12:43.396
Who are you?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.098
I'm Marcus.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.733
Uh...

12:46.766 --> 12:47.968
I think I'm almost there.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.602
Can you see this?

12:49.636 --> 12:51.771
Yeah, is that your fingers?

12:51.805 --> 12:53.106
MICKEY:
You're damn right it is.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.908
I'm coming in!

12:54.942 --> 12:56.844
(grunts)

12:59.012 --> 13:00.981
Oh, wow.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.515
A lot hotter up here.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.484
(grunts)

13:06.186 --> 13:07.988
(straining)

13:08.021 --> 13:09.256
Okay.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.457
All right, I'm stuck.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.925
I'm gonna need some help.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.360
How?

13:13.393 --> 13:15.829
Wrap your arms around my neck
like a football,

13:15.863 --> 13:17.497
and yank as hard
as you can, okay?

13:17.530 --> 13:18.665
You got this.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.367
Three, two, one.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.202
(both grunting)

13:22.235 --> 13:23.770
All right! Stop!

13:23.803 --> 13:25.472
Oh. All right.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.407
(screaming)

13:29.509 --> 13:31.611
(panting)

13:31.644 --> 13:34.447
Okay, this is as far
as I can go.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.850
I'm gonna need you to take it
into the end zone. Okay.

13:36.884 --> 13:39.119
No, no, no! Get-- don't...

13:39.152 --> 13:40.988
But don't touch me
anymore, okay?

13:41.021 --> 13:43.223
Okay. We're not doing football
any-- that's my fault.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.457
We're not doing football.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.626
We're switching sports.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.828
-We're on to fishing.
-How do we do that?

13:48.862 --> 13:51.798
Well, for starters,
we're gonna need a fishing rod.

13:51.831 --> 13:55.502
So I want you to close your eyes
and help me take off my bra.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.473
(snores)

14:00.507 --> 14:01.674
Oh, hey.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.043
You're up.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.012
(grunts)
Who the hell are you?

14:05.045 --> 14:06.413
I'm Gary.

14:06.446 --> 14:09.416
You, uh, passed out
on the road back there.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.717
What are you talk...

14:10.750 --> 14:12.485
Whoa, are you tickling me, man?

14:12.519 --> 14:13.921
Oh, no. That's the seat.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.489
You've got
the massage function on.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.325
-Massage function?
-Now, don't worry.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.859
We'll be at the hospital
pretty soon,

14:19.893 --> 14:21.528
-and they'll fix you right up.
-Oh, no.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.496
I'm not going
to any hospital, all right?

14:23.530 --> 14:24.932
I got a car situation.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.700
I need, like,
a-a slim jim or something.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.702
Oh. I'm sorry, I don't have one.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.939
Uh, but I'm sure
we can find one.

14:31.972 --> 14:35.408
Computer, what's the nearest
auto body shop?

14:35.442 --> 14:38.078
COMPUTER: Displaying matches
for "auto body shop."

14:38.111 --> 14:40.914
This car just kind of does
everything for you, huh?

14:40.948 --> 14:42.849
Pretty cool, right?

14:42.882 --> 14:44.918
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty cool.

14:44.952 --> 14:47.087
Till it gets sick of you
barking commands at it

14:47.120 --> 14:49.089
and slams your ass into a wall.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.958
Ha! Right.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.026
I guess I'll take my chances.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.128
L-Look, look, man, I'm kind of
in a rush, all right?

14:55.162 --> 14:57.430
So I don't know if this
spacecraft has another gear,

14:57.464 --> 14:59.432
-but if you could punch it...
-Well...

14:59.466 --> 15:00.600
Sure thing.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.102
(car whirring)

15:02.135 --> 15:03.937
Oh...

15:03.971 --> 15:05.905
Whoa.

15:09.476 --> 15:10.978
-Who the hell is this guy?
-Oh.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.479
He's a prostitute
I found online.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.613
Pretty good, right?

15:13.646 --> 15:14.881
No, not good.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.283
He looks nothing like my Marcus.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.219
-Well, oh, he doesn't
seem to mind.
-Yeah.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.553
That's the problem, okay?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.055
I-I can't compete with that.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.290
Oh, Chip.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.158
You need to see
the bigger picture.

15:25.192 --> 15:28.261
If Marcus is here and you are
here, then you can't be Marcus.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.263
I did you a favor. Now,

15:30.297 --> 15:32.465
you got a chance to get the girl
and get away clean.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.168
-CHIP: Okay. Let's do this.
-Mm-hmm.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.770
The ultimate showdown:
creator versus creation.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.439
Mind versus body.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.175
Superior intellect versus
hulking physical strength.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.510
Yes. Yes to all
of those things.

15:43.543 --> 15:44.811
Now, go get Holly.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.013
Go, go.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.314
(sighs)

15:47.347 --> 15:49.149
So, what's up, guys?

15:49.182 --> 15:51.518
-(groans)
-Hmm?

15:51.551 --> 15:53.653
I can't believe
that little troll hired somebody

15:53.686 --> 15:55.022
-to play Marcus.
-Yeah.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.290
As if no one would notice a
completely different black guy.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.625
(laughs)

15:58.658 --> 16:00.527
Oh, yeah,
Chip is very racist, yeah.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.095
-(exhales)
-You know,

16:02.129 --> 16:04.164
-you need to turn up the heat.
-How?

16:04.197 --> 16:05.665
Every time I get him against
the ropes, he finds a way

16:05.698 --> 16:07.200
to wiggle his stupid
little body out.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.002
Well, by, uh...

16:09.036 --> 16:12.339
Ooh. By pushing fake Marcus
and Holly closer together.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.174
-Damn. I like that.
-Yeah.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.109
-Mm-hmm.
-You're pretty good at this,
Alba.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.510
Mm, well, I try.

16:17.544 --> 16:21.048
Marcus, was it? You said
you're a tattoo artist?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.682
Yeah, well, you know, I'm an
artist first and foremost,

16:22.715 --> 16:26.019
-but I do like tattoos.
-(laughs)

16:26.053 --> 16:27.487
Yeah.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.623
This one, I, uh, I got it
when my grandma died.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.991
(gasps)

16:32.025 --> 16:33.993
-Oh.
-Yeah.
-SABRINA: Holly.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.296
Uh-- I'm sorr-- weren't you
saying that you wanted a tattoo?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.065
Oh, I don't know.
I really want one,

16:38.098 --> 16:40.033
I just wouldn't know
where to put it.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.468
Oh, well, I'm sure
Marcus could show you where

16:41.501 --> 16:43.503
-to put it. I mean...
-Oh, yeah. Most definitely.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.972
Why don't you two just go up
to my room and, you know,

16:46.005 --> 16:47.707
do a little free consultation
or whatever?

16:47.740 --> 16:49.176
Yeah. No.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.543
Or we could, you know,
keep down here.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.212
Keep rapping
on the current events.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.413
Yeah, no, I'm straight.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.514
Let's roll, Holly.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.085
Holly, wait.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.254
That's not the real Marcus.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.722
I'm the real Marcus.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.425
-What?
-Marcus Lella
of Ink Well Boston.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.994
I built an online persona
to get closer to you.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.362
What are you talking about?

17:09.396 --> 17:10.997
It wasn't Marcus who commented

17:11.030 --> 17:12.865
on your bikini pics,
saying "Get it, girl."

17:12.899 --> 17:14.667
Marcus didn't DM you, uh,

17:14.701 --> 17:16.903
well wishes after you had
your wisdom teeth pulled out.

17:16.936 --> 17:19.506
I did. Now, listen,
I know I'm not

17:19.539 --> 17:22.242
nearly as big and black
as he is, but I promise you,

17:22.275 --> 17:25.445
if you just give me a chance,
I promise I can make you happy.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.614
You're Marcus?

17:27.647 --> 17:29.582
(laughs)

17:29.616 --> 17:31.418
It's hilarious, right?

17:31.451 --> 17:33.720
I've been trying to smoke
this little perv out for weeks.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.255
Finally got him.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.723
Wait. You knew about this?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.258
And you were just gonna
let me hook up with...

17:38.291 --> 17:39.626
Trey.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.361
-Yeah, my real name's Trey.
-(exhales)

17:41.394 --> 17:42.529
Oh, my God.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.132
Both of you,
stay the hell away from me.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.473
-MICKEY: Did you get it?
-No.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.974
Should I try
pulling you in again?

17:55.007 --> 17:57.210
No, nope. That ship has sailed.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.611
I had to take my bottoms off
to beat the heat.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.280
Look, it's all you, now, okay?

18:00.313 --> 18:02.215
So take a deep breath and focus.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.716
(grunts)

18:03.750 --> 18:05.485
Oh, no...

18:05.518 --> 18:06.786
-Oh! I got something.
-You did?

18:06.819 --> 18:08.255
Reel it in.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.756
(grunts)
I can't, it's stuck.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.124
Pull harder, Ben.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.325
(grunts)

18:16.329 --> 18:18.131
What's happening?
Are we moving?

18:18.165 --> 18:20.267
-Yep.
-Oh, God, no, that's not good.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.235
All right, okay, don't panic.

18:22.269 --> 18:26.339
Just cross your fingers
and hope we slam into something.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.314
-BEN: Whee! We're flying.
-MICKEY: Yeah.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.482
What's going on
behind us, buddy?

18:35.515 --> 18:36.683
Can you give me
the play-by-play?

18:36.716 --> 18:38.751
Uh, there's a big open field,

18:38.785 --> 18:40.753
and stuff's going by real fast.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.589
Uh, how fast?
'Cause it feels pretty fast.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.158
-Um, really fast.
-Are we headed towards anything?

18:45.192 --> 18:47.360
-There's some grass.
-Oh, that's-- grass is good.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.529
-Gra-- I love grass.
-And some flowers.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.097
Flowers are beautiful.
No problem.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.533
-And a big old pond.
-No, no, no. No ponds.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.169
(both grunt)

18:59.706 --> 19:01.841
(sighs, laughs)

19:01.874 --> 19:03.376
-Oh, my God, we're alive!
-We're alive!

19:03.410 --> 19:04.677
We're okay!
Are you all right?

19:04.711 --> 19:05.945
I'm great, that was fun.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.347
Yeah, yeah. Super fun.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.481
Oh, wow, though...

19:08.515 --> 19:10.617
water's really filling up
back here.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.619
It feels... it feels
really good, actually.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.053
(shouts)
Something touched my leg.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.355
Now, get off me!

19:15.388 --> 19:16.489
Look, the phone!

19:16.523 --> 19:17.557
The phone!

19:17.590 --> 19:18.625
I did it!

19:18.658 --> 19:19.892
I saved us again.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.361
-Should I call 911?
-Yes!

19:21.394 --> 19:22.795
Get it.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.297
(panting)

19:24.331 --> 19:25.465
-Okay.
-(line ringing)

19:25.498 --> 19:27.234
OPERATOR:
911. What's your emergency?

19:27.267 --> 19:30.370
Send help. I-I'm mostly nude
in the back of a cop car

19:30.403 --> 19:33.540
about to drown with a young boy.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.243
Well, I have to hand it to you,
you didn't go down easy.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.877
Where the hell
did you find that guy?

19:37.910 --> 19:38.978
I didn't.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.146
Alba did.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.681
SABRINA:
What?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.750
Alba, you told me
that Chip hired him.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.652
-Yeah, you, uh...
-CHIP: Hold on.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.919
Why are you even
speaking to her?

19:46.953 --> 19:48.888
You were supposed to be
working for me.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.423
I was. I-I mean, I am.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.559
-Uh, I just, uh...
-SABRINA: Alba.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.927
What is going on?
Why did you do all of this?

19:54.961 --> 19:57.997
Uh, well, it was hot,
I was bored.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.300
I like drama. Hmm.

20:02.101 --> 20:03.770
Mickey?

20:03.803 --> 20:05.672
SABRINA:
Whoa.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.906
How was the real world?

20:08.975 --> 20:11.344
It was, um, it was great.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.546
Thanks for asking.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.448
Are you wearing a grocery bag?

20:15.482 --> 20:16.849
Mickey lost her pants
in the pond.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.851
Okay. Let's not gossip.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.053
(chuckles)

20:22.589 --> 20:24.491
ALBA:
Huh.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.531
JIMMY:
Come on. No way.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.367
You get Pearl Jam
24/7 on this thing?

20:34.401 --> 20:36.369
It's just satellite radio, man.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.904
You can get that in any car.

20:37.937 --> 20:38.971
Yeah, not my car.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.073
Hey, can you get porn
on this screen?

20:41.107 --> 20:42.542
I don't know.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.943
Hey, computer, play porn.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.778
COMPUTER:
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.914
Porn. Whatever you got.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.283
Amateur, point of view, Asian...

20:50.317 --> 20:52.051
No, no, could you not...?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.253
I've got kids, so...

20:54.287 --> 20:56.122
All right, well, that's fine,
I got kids, too.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.890
It doesn't mean we can't
watch a little porn together.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.459
-Relax.
-Y-You know, I think

20:59.492 --> 21:00.793
it's pretty close
to where you said.

21:00.827 --> 21:01.828
Does this look right to you?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.062
Oh, yeah, yeah. This is good.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.431
-This is really good.
-Oh, okay.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.232
I should get out here, too,
because I don't want her

21:06.265 --> 21:08.801
to see me in a car like this
with a guy like you.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.638
Yeah, but I'll tell you what:

21:11.671 --> 21:13.640
thanks for the ride, Morpheus.

21:13.673 --> 21:14.941
-Oh.
-Good luck in the future...

21:25.051 --> 21:28.321
(owl hooting)

21:28.355 --> 21:29.756
Mickey?!

21:29.789 --> 21:31.524
Ben?!

21:31.558 --> 21:33.926
Anybody?!

21:33.960 --> 21:35.862
(owl hooting)

21:38.631 --> 21:41.167
This could be it.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.170
MICKEY:
I save lives!

Hope you
enjoyed
kickin' it
with The Mick.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.979
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:54.381 --> 21:56.349

911. What's your emergency?

21:56.383 --> 21:58.985
MAN (on phone):
I'm on Flight 46,
and we're going down.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.788
Just tell my wife
I'm so sorry that I cannot
come home to you.

22:01.821 --> 22:02.855
Hello?

22:04.991 --> 22:07.927
This is your family.
We got you, okay?

22:09.596 --> 22:10.730
Rapid response now!

22:10.763 --> 22:13.700
-We can't save everyone.
-Says who?

22:13.733 --> 22:15.935
It's time we showed Gotham
who we are.
