WEBVTT

01:17.920 --> 01:19.120
Oh!

01:19.120 --> 01:20.280
Oi!

01:24.360 --> 01:26.200
 Get prisoners
to their cells.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.720
Right, everyone out.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.240
Come on, come on.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.880
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

01:41.280 --> 01:43.440
Help! Help me!

01:44.640 --> 01:46.240
No!

01:46.240 --> 01:47.440
Go! That way.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.760
Shit!

01:51.760 --> 01:52.920
Come on, move!

01:52.920 --> 01:55.400
No! No!

01:55.400 --> 01:56.800
That's enough.

01:56.800 --> 01:57.840
Put him down, yeah?

01:57.840 --> 02:00.080
No! Help me!

02:22.000 --> 02:24.200
You lost something, boss?

02:43.640 --> 02:46.400
It's under control.
You can go back in now.

03:21.800 --> 03:28.800
# Testator silens

03:31.520 --> 03:38.160
# Costestes e spiritu

03:38.160 --> 03:45.160
# Silentium

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
# Testator silens. #

04:09.200 --> 04:10.280
Thanks.

04:20.960 --> 04:23.280
Evening.
I'm Detective Inspector Dan Mason.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.360
Hi. Dr Nikki Alexander.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.840
This is my colleague,
Jack Hodgson. Hi.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.880
Shall we? Mm-hm.

05:06.520 --> 05:10.760
The name's Jay Selwyn.
27 years old.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.600
Been in here nine years.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.680
That right?

05:13.680 --> 05:14.800
Manslaughter.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.640
When it all kicked off,
the kitchen supervisor, Leon Tovey,

05:17.640 --> 05:19.600
evacuated the whole team.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.480
Jay must have got left behind.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.240
I'd like to speak to
that supervisor. Not possible.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.880
They cracked his head open.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.800
He got taken to the local hospital

05:27.800 --> 05:30.160
and now he's in an induced coma,
poor sod.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.880
We know who attacked him?
Oh, yeah.

05:31.880 --> 05:35.360
Lewis Harvey.
He's our resident maniac.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.280
He's in an isolation cell now.

05:44.880 --> 05:48.360
He got trapped in here? Um,
mechanism does appear to be broken,

05:48.360 --> 05:51.160
so he wouldn't have been
able to open it from the inside.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.040
There's no damage
to the inside of the door, though,

05:54.040 --> 05:56.680
so no indication he was
trying to force it open, either.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.040
Jay Selwyn,
wrong place, wrong time.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.720
Thoughts, then?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.760
Well, there's no blood traces
in here.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.320
Nikki?

06:10.320 --> 06:11.480
Um?

06:11.480 --> 06:12.880
What do you think?

06:14.080 --> 06:15.360
Ah...

06:15.360 --> 06:19.320
Well, he has lacerations to his face
and bruising around the left eye.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.800
Looks like he's been assaulted.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.360
Um. Well, not in here, obviously,
if there's no blood present.

06:26.360 --> 06:30.040
The prisoners get their deliveries
on a Wednesday. Deliveries?

06:30.040 --> 06:32.040
Yeah, they can
order stuff with their money

06:32.040 --> 06:33.560
if they've been well behaved.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.240
It's all used as currency in here,

06:35.240 --> 06:37.400
so Wednesdays is
always a bit tense.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.120
Do you think that's how
he could have got these injuries?

06:40.120 --> 06:42.360
It's when all the debts are settled.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.840
What have you found?

06:52.840 --> 06:54.200
Shepherd's pie.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.160
Apart from that, not much.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.240
The body's ready to transport, so
I'm heading back to the Lyell now.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.760
You're not staying to
help with the washing-up, then?

07:01.760 --> 07:03.920
I think I'll pass.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.160
Nikki?

07:06.160 --> 07:08.800
Could you...could you pop up
to D Wing before you go, please?

07:08.800 --> 07:11.360
The victim's cellmate's
keen to give a DNA sample.

07:11.360 --> 07:14.840
Has to be squeaky clean for his case
review in a few days, apparently.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.680
Sure.
Thanks very much.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.240
What's the name?
Um, Weston.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.040
Scott Weston.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.400
This is James Scott's cell.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.600
Scott's been moved out.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.600
The place is falling apart.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.520
Um...

08:32.800 --> 08:35.920
Ah, that's James' bunk.
All right.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.760
As quickly as we take them away,
they'll make a new one.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.200
That's his brother.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.160
Stand up.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.880
Move to the back of the room.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.520
I'm just going to swab
the inside of your mouth.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.360
And again.

11:26.280 --> 11:29.360
I've told you before, I can't
let you in without an appointment.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.200
I need to see
the governor right now.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.880
You don't understand.

12:42.680 --> 12:47.560
They've said this building isn't
fit for purpose any more.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.840
I know it's been
a difficult few days,

12:49.840 --> 12:51.960
but we all
need to remain focused.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.480
Transfers have all been allocated.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.080
Inmates have all been
informed where they're heading.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.960
Some of them are
moving further away from home

12:59.960 --> 13:01.640
and they're not happy about it,

13:01.640 --> 13:03.160
so let's be vigilant.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.320
It's been like a
tinderbox in here as it is.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.280
Which is why I'm expecting pushback.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.240
Look, it's our last week.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.760
Let's make it a good one.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.880
Oh, listen...

13:14.880 --> 13:18.480
You do an impossible job
and, together with your teams,

13:18.480 --> 13:20.240
you do it brilliantly.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.560
Hi. Detective Inspector Mason.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.680
I'm looking for Dionne Selwyn.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.080
I was told she was here.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.400
Yes, please come in.
Thank you.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.960
Jay Selwyn, black male, 28.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.600
Given observations of the body
at the time

13:54.600 --> 13:57.720
and the ambient temperature
of the fridge, I estimate

13:57.720 --> 14:01.480
that he was dead for at
least an hour before he was found,

14:01.480 --> 14:04.120
although it's difficult
to be precise.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.800
There's small lacerations
and bruising around the face.

14:30.720 --> 14:34.080
Blunt force injuries are consistent
with the deceased being involved

14:34.080 --> 14:35.960
in some kind of altercation.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.440
Multiple scars, both forearms,
different ages.

14:44.440 --> 14:46.320
Consistent with self-harm.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.200
No offensive
injuries to the knuckles,

15:07.200 --> 15:11.240
possibly suggesting that he
was attacked rather than in a fight.

15:19.520 --> 15:22.200
Slight discoloration on the abdomen.

15:25.760 --> 15:28.200
Could be bruising
developing postmortem.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.560
I'm afraid there's no mistake.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.960
I'm very sorry for your loss,
Mrs Selwyn.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.640
How did Jay seem to you?

15:45.640 --> 15:47.600
Was he in good spirits?

15:47.600 --> 15:50.960
Until those guards
laid into him yesterday.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.880
I only wanted to give my son a hug.
He's my son.

15:54.880 --> 15:58.680
I should have held on to him.
I should have never let him go.

15:58.680 --> 15:59.960
Mum, let's go home, yeah?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.960
Did he take his own life?

16:01.960 --> 16:03.320
Why do you ask that?

16:06.200 --> 16:07.800
Henry!

16:12.680 --> 16:17.200
The DNA report
on Jay's cellmate has come back.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.480
Scott Weston. I know that name.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.320
You do.

16:24.680 --> 16:28.640
He went on a killing spree
right here at the university.

16:30.640 --> 16:31.960
That was him?!

16:33.320 --> 16:35.800
It was a bit of
a shock to see him again.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.280
Harry and I got caught up in it.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.880
Oh, my God!

16:41.880 --> 16:44.640
We hid with some of the students.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.440
Heard him coming.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.360
Heard the gunshots getting closer.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.040
I had no idea.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.720
No reason you should.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.920
It's been ten years.

16:57.920 --> 17:01.000
I haven't thought about
it for a long, long time.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.440
Did he recognise you?

17:04.040 --> 17:05.720
I hope so.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.440
Are you OK to be working on this?

17:11.600 --> 17:13.200
Yeah.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.920
I'm all right. Honestly.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.400
It just took
me by surprise, that's all.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.160
I'm feeling a
bit weird anyway today.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.280
I've agreed to
take over Thomas' lectures.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.280
Oh, he'd be pleased.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.920
I don't know.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.640
Thomas was so good at all that,
wasn't he?

17:27.640 --> 17:29.320
You'll be grand! You're a natural.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.760
You're very good
at telling people what to do.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.800
I'm only good at telling
you what to do.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.640
Steady! You're sounding
more and more like Clarissa.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.240
I miss them.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.120
Me too.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.920
Hey, what's your problem?
Come on, then!

18:06.920 --> 18:08.880
Come on!

18:08.880 --> 18:10.880
Incident in the recreation yard.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.560
What's your problem?
You are!

18:17.280 --> 18:19.040
Go on, do one!

18:27.600 --> 18:29.760
This is Jay Selwyn's heart.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.560
It's enlarged, which is unusual.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.600
We might see that in cases of fatal
cardiac arrhythmia.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.520
What might have caused that?

18:38.520 --> 18:39.920
Well, it's difficult to say.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.640
He didn't have
any known heart issues.

18:44.160 --> 18:48.640
Bloke winds up dead in a fridge
surrounded by hundreds of murderers.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.720
Doesn't scream natural causes,
does it?

18:51.720 --> 18:56.000
Well, the exact cause of death is,
I'm afraid, inconclusive.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.560
I've taken histology samples,

18:57.560 --> 18:59.840
but I don't expect
anything more conclusive

18:59.840 --> 19:03.440
to come back from that unless
the myocardium throws up something.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.040
And what's that when it's at home?

19:05.040 --> 19:08.040
The heart muscle. Oh.
It'll take a few days to come back.

19:08.040 --> 19:11.840
So based on the circumstantial
evidence, the stress haemorrhages

19:11.840 --> 19:14.880
in his stomach, the fact
that he wasn't wearing much clothing

19:14.880 --> 19:19.320
and that he was found in a very cold
environment, I'd have to conclude

19:19.320 --> 19:22.760
that the most likely cause of death
is hypothermia.

19:23.720 --> 19:24.880
Um.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.760
Will you excuse me for a moment?
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

19:46.800 --> 19:50.680
Pamela... I thought
it was you at the prison.

19:55.680 --> 19:58.440
How are you?
How have you been?

19:59.400 --> 20:01.480
Not great.

20:01.480 --> 20:05.600
Scott's having his case
reviewed by a commission next week.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.520
He's trying
to appeal his conviction.

20:08.520 --> 20:11.880
That's why I was at the prison,
to protest to the governor.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.440
Scott's barely served ten years.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.120
And now the prison's closing down.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.960
There's a push to get him
moved to somewhere low security.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.760
This is the first step in reducing
his sentence, isn't it?

20:21.760 --> 20:24.400
Reviewing on what grounds?
They gave him a life order.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.480
There's a whole online campaign now.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.960
There's a psychologist
who works at the prison.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.120
Dr Taylor Lawson.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.320
Have you heard of him?

20:33.320 --> 20:36.560
He's supporting Scott's case review.

20:36.560 --> 20:39.480
It says it was an unsafe conviction.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.480
He has an old scan of Scott's brain.

20:41.480 --> 20:44.040
He said he suffered a
head injury when he was a child.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.080
Is it true?
No!

20:46.080 --> 20:47.240
Maybe...

20:47.240 --> 20:49.440
I don't know any more.
That's not the point.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.160
He's saying it would
be diminished responsibility.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.040
He says he's got medical proof.

20:54.040 --> 20:58.920
If he convinces this review board,
Scott's appeal will go ahead.

21:00.120 --> 21:04.440
You know as well as I do,
if he got out, he'd kill again.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.920
I went to see the governor.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.240
I saw the police.

21:12.240 --> 21:16.040
What were you doing
there, was someone killed?

21:16.040 --> 21:17.880
You know I can't tell you that.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.480
Do you think Scott's behind it?

21:20.480 --> 21:22.840
I will fight to my last
breath to keep him behind bars.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.080
Even though he's your son?

21:24.080 --> 21:25.440
It's the only thing I can do now

21:25.440 --> 21:28.120
for all those
families that he destroyed.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.840
But I can't do it alone.
It's not our responsibility.

21:30.840 --> 21:33.520
Yes, it is. You were the
key witness at the first trial.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.600
Maybe you could
speak to the commission.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.720
It doesn't work like that.

21:37.720 --> 21:40.240
We have to speak up
for those who can't speak up

21:40.240 --> 21:41.920
for themselves any more.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.400
My God, what have they done to you?

21:51.040 --> 21:52.560
Jay is dead.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.480
I'm so sorry.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.440
I'm on my own now.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.480
What am I going to do?

22:04.480 --> 22:07.000
You have to tell someone...
I can't.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.480
I can't.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.120
It's going to mess everything up.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.000
I've got to get out of here,
Paisley.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.960
You will, I promise.

22:20.680 --> 22:21.920
The appeal application

22:21.920 --> 22:23.040
gets heard next week.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.120
Have you spoke to Mum again?

22:30.120 --> 22:31.200
Not yet.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.360
Paisley...

22:33.360 --> 22:35.040
You don't need her, you've got me.

22:35.040 --> 22:38.000
She hasn't even been
to see you in ten years.

22:40.680 --> 22:43.360
I do need her, though, don't I?

22:43.360 --> 22:44.640
Eh?

22:44.640 --> 22:46.920
I do.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.840
She just needs to see the truth.

22:50.280 --> 22:53.120
See the evidence for herself.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.160
Yeah?

22:55.280 --> 22:57.120
You've got to make her see.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.680
Argh!

23:04.160 --> 23:05.440
Sorry.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.360
I'm not feeling good at all, you
know. I want to go back to me cell.

23:11.360 --> 23:12.680
Don't! Wait, wait.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.000
It's just a few more days.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.720
No, I can't take a few more days,
Paisley.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.000
I can't.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.800
If Jay was there,
yeah, maybe I could, but...

23:22.800 --> 23:24.400
..it's just me now.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.160
It's all on me.

23:28.280 --> 23:31.000
Just try and
concentrate on the appeal.

23:32.760 --> 23:34.960
What chance have
I got if I can't even persuade

23:34.960 --> 23:37.400
my own mum to
give me the time of day?

23:39.680 --> 23:42.000
How is that going to look
to everyone?

24:20.160 --> 24:21.920
Good afternoon.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.160
Thanks for coming to this lecture.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.880
Oh, hello again.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.480
What are you doing here?

24:33.480 --> 24:37.760
I work with the prisoners and their
families when I'm required.

24:37.760 --> 24:41.920
I'm here to lend some support
to some of Jay's closest friends.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.040
Some of them have
taken the loss pretty hard.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.960
Oh, yeah?

24:46.960 --> 24:48.240
Like who?

24:51.120 --> 24:53.440
Now, the words "autopsy",

24:53.440 --> 24:56.440
from the Greek,
meaning to see for oneself,

24:56.440 --> 25:01.000
and "postmortem",
from the Latin, meaning after death,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.720
are interchangeable
and you will hear both.

25:05.240 --> 25:11.160
So the first incision
is made from behind one ear

25:11.160 --> 25:12.640
and comes down the neck,

25:12.640 --> 25:16.240
round the front of the collarbone
to the centre.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.920
You will then do the
same to the other side.

25:18.920 --> 25:22.840
And the final incision to the Y
will go straight down the middle

25:22.840 --> 25:24.520
to the pelvis,

25:24.520 --> 25:27.720
and this gives us
access to the internal organs.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.920
So, Billy, you found
Jay's body, didn't you?

25:35.560 --> 25:38.160
I hear Jay could be a bit of
a troublemaker.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.880
Jay was all right.

25:39.880 --> 25:42.320
Once they give you
a bad rep in here, that's it.

25:42.320 --> 25:43.840
Can't change no-one's mind.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.840
Hm. And I suppose they
labelled you

25:45.840 --> 25:48.800
the troublemaker's friend,
didn't they?

25:48.800 --> 25:51.120
It must have been hard for you,

25:51.120 --> 25:53.360
especially
when you're so near parole.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.440
We weren't as
close as we used to be.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.120
Probably a wise move.

26:00.360 --> 26:03.160
So, what do you
think happened to Jay?

26:05.120 --> 26:07.160
Got himself in debt.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.640
Who with?

26:11.560 --> 26:12.960
Don't know, man.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.160
It's OK, Billy.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.000
Withholding evidence
in an official investigation,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.960
that's definitely
not good for your parole.

26:25.760 --> 26:28.960
All I know is Lewis was
looking for Jay the day he died.

26:28.960 --> 26:32.840
He'd already had a kicking
and Jay knew if he didn't cough up,

26:32.840 --> 26:35.240
Lewis would send someone
to finish the job.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.000
As clearly illustrated here,

26:40.000 --> 26:41.600
you will see that the skin

26:41.600 --> 26:44.680
can be fully retracted
over the skull

26:44.680 --> 26:47.120
without having to cut the face.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.960
Excuse me.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.080
Yes?

26:50.080 --> 26:52.920
When do you stop, uh, you know,

26:52.920 --> 26:54.920
getting affected by what you see?

26:54.920 --> 26:58.760
Well, I wouldn't be a very
good pathologist if I was, would I?

26:59.840 --> 27:03.560
Well, no, it's a good question,
actually. Um...

27:03.560 --> 27:07.560
I guess when I get
into my car at the end of the day,

27:07.560 --> 27:10.320
I try to leave my work behind

27:10.320 --> 27:13.240
and to compartmentalise it
from my home life.

27:17.680 --> 27:21.880
So you think Lewis caught
up with Jay?

27:21.880 --> 27:24.600
He lends money
and then hikes up the interest.

27:24.600 --> 27:28.240
I hear more about
him than any other inmate.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.440
Jay only had a week left here too.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.200
I bet he couldn't wait to be
transferred.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.280
You must be joking.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.520
What do you mean?

27:37.520 --> 27:40.080
Jay just found out they
were moving him with Scott.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.120
He was gutted.

27:41.120 --> 27:43.000
I thought they were big mates.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.440
They shared a cell,
but Jay can't stand Scott.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.760
Wanted to get as far
away from him as possible.

27:52.280 --> 27:53.600
Hello, Lewis.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.200
Detective Inspector Mason.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.000
I've got a
few questions to ask you.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.680
Yeah? Step inside, then, mate.

27:58.680 --> 28:01.040
Come on, come on.
Come in!

28:02.120 --> 28:06.840
You were heard making death threats
to Jay Selwyn the day he died.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.280
He owed me.

28:10.280 --> 28:11.600
He borrowed from me.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.440
You borrow from me,
you need to pay up.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.200
Did you kill him?

28:16.200 --> 28:17.640
Open this door, Tony.

28:17.640 --> 28:20.240
Come on, the man wants to talk.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.400
Did you kill him?

28:26.400 --> 28:29.160
Look, yeah?

28:29.160 --> 28:33.240
I would've if I'd have got
my hands on him,

28:33.240 --> 28:36.320
but slippery little Jay got away,
didn't he?

28:36.320 --> 28:37.640
Hm.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.520
So who did kill him, then?

28:40.920 --> 28:44.640
Come on, Lewis. Nothing happens
in here without your permission.

28:47.040 --> 28:52.000
Let's just say, yeah,
I've got a friend in the kitchen

28:52.000 --> 28:53.400
I didn't know I had.

28:56.040 --> 28:59.200
Come on, mate, come in!
Come on, come on.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.400
I don't bite! Come on!

29:00.400 --> 29:01.440
Come in, mate.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.120
Come on, we'll have a little cup
of tea, yeah?

29:09.520 --> 29:12.440
Dr Alexander, that was great.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.680
Thank you.
Oh, my pleasure.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.560
I'm Ollie.

29:16.560 --> 29:19.200
I read your paper on asphyxiation.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.800
It took my breath away.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.320
Sorry I'm late.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.600
How'd it go?

29:34.600 --> 29:36.480
It was fine.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.680
I enjoyed it.

29:37.680 --> 29:38.800
Good.

29:38.800 --> 29:44.440
OK! This is the CCTV the day
Jay Selwyn died.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.600
Right, now, we catch him here

29:47.600 --> 29:50.280
and there during recreation time.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.120
And then he literally disappears

29:52.120 --> 29:53.200
during lunch hour.

29:53.200 --> 29:58.400
No footage of him anywhere and he
doesn't appear in any roll calls.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.480
And then we pick him up again

30:00.480 --> 30:03.160
on a visiting room camera
early afternoon.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.360
Using quite a lot of force. Mm.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.160
That's what Jay's mum said.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.880
And...

30:11.880 --> 30:13.920
..that's where we lose him.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.880
Could they have caused
Jay's injuries?

30:15.880 --> 30:18.200
There were no signs
of blood spatter in Jay's cell.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.560
No indication an assault
took place there at all, in fact.

30:20.560 --> 30:21.680
Yeah, and look.

30:21.680 --> 30:24.520
Here they are a few
seconds later, minus Jay.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.000
Who's that girl with Scott Weston?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.360
Uh, yeah, according to the
prison officers, her name

30:29.360 --> 30:31.000
is Paisley Robinson.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.480
She befriended Scott
after he was convicted.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.160
One of those.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.320
Now, this is interesting.

30:40.320 --> 30:44.320
The prison failed
its last inspection. Ah.

30:44.320 --> 30:47.520
Yeah, the report says
the outcome for released prisoners

30:47.520 --> 30:49.600
was very poor,
reoffending was high,

30:49.600 --> 30:51.760
and the governor's
taken some flak.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.520
So that's the real reason
for it closing down,

30:54.520 --> 30:57.560
I think, failure to rehabilitate,
and their death rate

30:57.560 --> 31:00.800
was a little bit higher than
the national average, too.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.200
Nothing horrendous, but above.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.320
Do you think prison staff

31:03.320 --> 31:05.480
might have had something
to do with Jay's death?

31:05.480 --> 31:07.320
Well, keeping an open mind.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.280
Lots of people come and go,

31:09.280 --> 31:11.560
so plenty of other
avenues to explore.

31:11.560 --> 31:15.000
Jay's cellmate, for one,
Scott Weston.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.280
He's just moved up my list.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.640
He's a suspect?

31:18.640 --> 31:20.880
Well, apparently him and Jay

31:20.880 --> 31:23.560
weren't as cosy as we thought.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.960
But this doesn't really fit
with Weston's MO, does it?

31:27.960 --> 31:29.440
It does.

31:29.440 --> 31:32.080
Scott Weston started his
killing spree at the university

31:32.080 --> 31:35.120
by murdering his friend and making
it look like suicide. Mm-hm.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.600
Weston was jumped in the yard today.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.240
Given a right going-over.

31:40.240 --> 31:42.480
Same perp who attacked Jay?

31:42.480 --> 31:44.040
Well, that's always possible.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.760
Either way, we should get pictures
of Weston's injuries for comparison.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.480
Sure.

31:48.480 --> 31:52.160
Would a forensic medical
examiner not be better?

31:52.160 --> 31:56.840
No. I'd like to do
it, for continuity,

31:56.840 --> 31:59.440
especially if Scott Weston
is a person of interest.

31:59.440 --> 32:00.640
Got to run.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.720
Pamela, what's happened?

32:15.040 --> 32:16.080
Who did this?

32:19.600 --> 32:23.400
We've spoken to the police.
Maybe they could relocate you.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.000
It'll pass. Always does.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.040
It only takes one person to snap
my picture at the supermarket

32:31.040 --> 32:32.640
and it's all over the internet -

32:32.640 --> 32:35.800
"Campus killer's mother found."

32:35.800 --> 32:36.840
What's the point?

32:38.880 --> 32:40.360
Guess it's the appeal.

32:40.360 --> 32:43.400
Seeing his face in the papers again

32:43.400 --> 32:45.240
wakes up everyone's bad feeling.

32:45.240 --> 32:48.720
The worst ones are the ones
who are in love with him.

32:48.720 --> 32:51.680
They think that it's all my fault,
that I was a bad mother.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.880
Maybe they're right. It sounds like
defamation of character to me,

32:56.880 --> 33:00.680
that that psychologist
is trying to put it all on you.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.600
Don't you worry about me.

33:02.600 --> 33:03.800
I'll be OK.

33:06.840 --> 33:09.240
Why are you so sure that Scott
had something to do

33:09.240 --> 33:10.880
with the prison death?

33:14.280 --> 33:16.240
Got away with it last time.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.200
What do you mean?

33:25.120 --> 33:30.560
Ronan Flynn - another one of
Scott's previous cellmates.

33:31.720 --> 33:33.680
The coroner recorded
an open verdict.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.200
Hi there, you've reached
Jack Hodgson.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.680
If you leave a message,
I'll get back to you.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.080
Anything new?

36:41.080 --> 36:43.520
I examined Jay's underwear.
I found semen.

36:44.760 --> 36:46.000
It isn't his own.

36:47.280 --> 36:50.080
Could it be assault?
Might be linked to his death.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.120
We can't rule it out,

36:51.120 --> 36:54.160
but there were no indications of
sexual assault on the body.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.960
Could've been consensual. Or
from someone who coerced him

36:56.960 --> 36:58.920
into it being consensual.

36:58.920 --> 37:01.360
Well, whoever that person is,
we need to speak to them.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.160
Run the DNA through the system.
We have.

37:03.160 --> 37:05.440
Who was it? No match.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.920
Are you sure?

37:06.920 --> 37:09.680
A prison full of convicted criminals
and no DNA?

37:09.680 --> 37:12.160
Yep, ran it twice.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.560
Wasn't an inmate.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.800
No-one's getting arrested.

37:26.800 --> 37:31.200
We're just asking for some voluntary
DNA samples from you and your teams.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.400
We're around the inmates
all the time.

37:33.400 --> 37:36.120
Our DNA is going to be all over
them - of course it is.

37:36.120 --> 37:40.160
A union rep's going to call me back.
You'll have to wait.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.880
Is that really necessary?

37:41.880 --> 37:43.920
And if they all go out on strike,

37:43.920 --> 37:45.840
what am I going to do, then?

37:45.840 --> 37:49.280
Jay had a significant amount
of DNA on his clothes.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.200
It isn't a match for any inmates.

37:51.200 --> 37:54.040
So we just want to identify
who it belongs to.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.120
Fine. Do me.

37:57.120 --> 37:59.000
We've been told to wait
for the union rep.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.400
If we don't do as they ask,

38:00.400 --> 38:02.040
they won't provide cover for us.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.880
I've got nothing to hide.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.960
Fine, I'll do it.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.920
Well, you'll understand
why I have to decline.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.280
All right?

38:24.280 --> 38:28.000
Detective Inspector Mason wants us
to examine your injuries.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.280
Sit on the bed, please.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.320
You ain't changed.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.560
Put your hands out in front
of you, palms up.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.240
And turn them over.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.200
That looks recent.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.040
And leave them there, please.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.360
Tried to say I'm sorry.

39:48.880 --> 39:49.920
Head to the left.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.320
And to the right.

40:00.440 --> 40:01.920
Remove your top.

40:06.560 --> 40:08.480
Skin a bunny rabbit, eh?

40:11.600 --> 40:13.840
That's what my mum
used to always say.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.080
Skin a bunny rabbit.

40:22.440 --> 40:25.080
This is Lewis's usual corner.

40:25.080 --> 40:27.040
Lewis has been a busy boy.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.880
If someone gave Jay a going-over,
it'll be Lewis.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.600
Jay owed him money.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.880
There's no way
all this came from one person.

40:33.880 --> 40:37.600
I imagine a few unfortunate souls
have left deposits on these walls.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.760
I'll have to take multiple samples.

40:40.760 --> 40:44.440
There is a nice, clear fingerprint
in the blood.

40:44.440 --> 40:46.320
If this is Lewis's print,

40:46.320 --> 40:48.520
it would give us potential motive
and evidence.

40:50.200 --> 40:54.000
Does Scott Weston have a reputation
for being violent in here?

40:54.000 --> 40:57.320
No. Never had a moment's
trouble with him in all these years.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.400
Yeah, I'm sure.

40:59.520 --> 41:03.560
Men like Scott spend most of their
time pretending they don't exist.

41:03.560 --> 41:07.000
Blokes who commit crimes
like his don't do well inside.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.480
That's why Jay was so good for him.

41:09.480 --> 41:10.640
Uh, excuse me.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.720
I'm looking for Detective
Inspector Mason.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.200
I'm Dr Lawson.

41:14.200 --> 41:17.240
You're the one advocating
for Scott Weston's appeal.

41:17.240 --> 41:20.680
Scott sustained an injury
to the frontal cortex, aged six,

41:20.680 --> 41:23.440
leading to long-term
neurocognitive, behavioural

41:23.440 --> 41:25.120
and psychiatric disturbance.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.720
Please, take a seat.

41:26.720 --> 41:30.320
Now, this created deficits
in his emotional regulation

41:30.320 --> 41:33.480
with...tragic consequences.

41:33.480 --> 41:37.120
Are you suggesting he somehow
wasn't responsible for his actions?

41:37.120 --> 41:39.800
Well, he was neglected as a child.

41:39.800 --> 41:43.440
Scott told me some very...vivid
accounts of his mother's

41:43.440 --> 41:45.000
violence towards him.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.560
I take it you've spoken to Pamela
Weston about these allegations.

41:48.560 --> 41:52.400
I have the brain scans, and his NHS
records show that he was admitted

41:52.400 --> 41:55.880
for a traumatic brain injury at six
years old, and he was unconscious

41:55.880 --> 41:57.760
for more than 30 minutes.

41:57.760 --> 42:01.640
That would categorise
the brain injury as "severe".

42:01.640 --> 42:04.760
It's my belief that the damage,
very sadly,

42:04.760 --> 42:09.640
made it impossible for him to
suppress the impulse to kill.

42:09.640 --> 42:11.080
Excuse me.

42:12.600 --> 42:15.600
Sorry, this place
should be condemned.

42:15.600 --> 42:18.720
If Weston can't control
his impulses, surely that's

42:18.720 --> 42:21.080
more reason to keep him locked up.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.720
Well, now I've managed to identify
Scott's condition,

42:23.720 --> 42:24.880
following his appeal,

42:24.880 --> 42:27.160
he'll be able to receive
the right treatment

42:27.160 --> 42:30.240
and the most effective
kind of rehabilitation.

42:30.240 --> 42:33.680
If victims of these traumatic
brain injuries

42:33.680 --> 42:37.960
experience problems with impulse
control and aggression,

42:37.960 --> 42:39.600
then why is Scott so calm?

42:41.720 --> 42:43.320
Well...

42:43.320 --> 42:48.200
I understand it's hard for us
to accept, given the horrendous

42:48.200 --> 42:52.760
nature of his crimes. I mean,
that is true for me as well.

42:52.760 --> 42:55.640
But Scott is a victim
in all of this, too.

42:55.640 --> 42:57.280
If he'd been on the right treatment,

42:57.280 --> 43:00.080
those crimes would never
have been committed.

43:00.080 --> 43:01.120
So...

43:02.120 --> 43:04.000
..who are the guilty ones, really?

43:40.360 --> 43:42.880
I've got something to show you!

43:48.920 --> 43:50.120
What's this?

43:50.120 --> 43:52.960
I was just looking at the samples
we took from the exercise yard.

43:52.960 --> 43:56.560
There were multiple blood sources,
as we thought, but the fingerprint

43:56.560 --> 43:59.560
we lifted was set in Jay's blood.

43:59.560 --> 44:02.160
So, likelihood is
that was the location Jay

44:02.160 --> 44:04.560
was assaulted, and by Lewis.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.480
Did you find a match for the print?
Yep.

44:06.480 --> 44:09.320
I'm going to speak to DI Mason
about it later.

44:10.640 --> 44:13.480
I presume it was Lewis's
fingerprint in the blood?

44:13.480 --> 44:15.520
Ah, no, actually, it wasn't.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.240
Er...

44:17.240 --> 44:19.800
It belonged to Scott Weston.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.960
Oh, wait, wait.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.240
It's not enough to put him
in the frame for murder.

44:24.240 --> 44:25.760
You can't date the print

44:25.760 --> 44:29.080
and Jay died of hypothermia, right?

44:29.080 --> 44:31.040
Yes.

44:31.040 --> 44:34.440
But it might just be enough
to stop his appeal.

44:43.320 --> 44:45.080
Thank you so much
for bringing this down.

44:45.080 --> 44:47.320
Mrs Selwyn was keen for him to be
buried in his suit.

44:47.320 --> 44:50.240
It's the least I could do, really.

44:50.240 --> 44:51.640
I liked Jay.

44:51.640 --> 44:53.280
He had potential.

44:53.280 --> 44:54.920
I'll make sure it gets passed on.

44:56.880 --> 45:00.240
Ah! Just the man.
You got a few minutes?

45:00.240 --> 45:01.640
Oh, I really should be, er...

45:04.040 --> 45:07.280
Sorry, it's the...the diabetes.
If I don't eat, I...

45:08.240 --> 45:09.280
Oh!

45:09.280 --> 45:11.440
Would you like to sit down?

45:11.440 --> 45:12.720
Er, yeah.

45:39.840 --> 45:40.880
Better?

45:40.880 --> 45:41.920
Ah.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.960
My wife's got me on this paleo diet.

45:45.960 --> 45:48.360
I'm starving all the bloody time!

45:50.080 --> 45:52.440
What was it you wanted to ask me?

45:52.440 --> 45:53.680
Oh, yes.

45:53.680 --> 45:56.640
Jay was assaulted shortly
before he was found dead

45:56.640 --> 45:58.440
in the fridge.

45:58.440 --> 46:01.400
And the evidence suggests
it was Scott Weston.

46:01.400 --> 46:04.080
We found Scott's fingerprint
in Jay's blood.

46:04.080 --> 46:06.720
Scott also has injuries
consistent with an assault,

46:06.720 --> 46:08.080
which he tried to cover up.

46:08.080 --> 46:12.480
But Scott was so keen for them
to be moved together.

46:12.480 --> 46:14.640
Scott requested to stay with Jay?

46:14.640 --> 46:17.240
I thought that was your request.

46:17.240 --> 46:20.680
Well, it made sense for them
to be kept together.

46:20.680 --> 46:23.000
Scott was concerned
where Jay might end up

46:23.000 --> 46:25.080
because of the terms
of his sentence.

46:25.080 --> 46:28.120
And Jay was on an indefinite
prison sentence, is that right?

46:29.520 --> 46:31.920
No, the government
has done away with them now,

46:31.920 --> 46:34.440
but there remains an unlucky
few still serving them.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.760
If you think sentences
are too lenient, take

46:37.760 --> 46:39.880
it up with a court, not me.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.840
I believe what I do
makes a difference.

46:43.840 --> 46:46.240
Otherwise, it's not justice.

46:46.240 --> 46:47.600
It's revenge.

46:50.800 --> 46:54.280
Leon, what can you tell me
about the day Jay died?

46:55.800 --> 46:58.320
We were prepping for
the dinner service,

46:58.320 --> 47:00.200
and Jay was a wreck.

47:00.200 --> 47:05.440
He was convinced that Lewis
was sending someone to kill him.

47:05.440 --> 47:08.840
They'd already given him
a going-over.

47:08.840 --> 47:11.120
Thought he was going to top himself.

47:11.120 --> 47:14.160
Sounds like you got
to know Jay quite well.

47:14.160 --> 47:16.040
Grew up on the same estate.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.560
Oh. Hmph!

47:17.560 --> 47:19.640
Didn't think that was allowed.

47:19.640 --> 47:23.200
I mean, for you to work with people
you knew on the outside.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.200
Yeah, I should have talked
to the governor

47:25.200 --> 47:26.680
when I realised Jay was there.

47:28.240 --> 47:30.400
He was so happy to see me.

47:30.400 --> 47:31.760
What was the harm?

47:34.440 --> 47:38.360
If you knew Jay so well
and you were worried about him,

47:38.360 --> 47:41.240
why didn't you alert
one of the guards?

47:41.240 --> 47:43.120
I was going to.

47:43.120 --> 47:44.880
I was.

47:44.880 --> 47:48.120
Then the fight broke out
and they were right there.

47:48.120 --> 47:50.760
Jay started having
a panic attack.

47:50.760 --> 47:53.640
Had to do something,
so I hid him. In the fridge?

47:55.800 --> 47:58.120
It's the only place
I could think of.

47:59.640 --> 48:01.200
How long was Jay there?

48:02.800 --> 48:05.240
Erm... I don't know.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.400
I don't remember anything else.

48:07.400 --> 48:11.080
The prisoners broke into
the kitchen wing and attacked you.

48:11.080 --> 48:13.120
Yeah, and killed Jay.

48:13.120 --> 48:14.840
N-no.

48:14.840 --> 48:16.120
No, they didn't find him.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.320
In all likelihood,

48:21.320 --> 48:24.000
Jay died of hypothermia, Leon.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.480
Oh, no.

48:27.200 --> 48:28.720
I...

48:28.720 --> 48:30.960
I never meant to hurt him.

48:30.960 --> 48:32.000
I swear.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.240
He was family to me.

48:43.920 --> 48:45.280
I'm sorry.

48:51.600 --> 48:54.240
Oh, hi. Hello.

48:54.240 --> 48:57.480
Henry? I was just starting my shift
so I thought I'd pop in.

49:13.480 --> 49:17.640
Thanks. I just need to do my final
checks and sign the paperwork.

49:17.640 --> 49:19.920
I suspect the coroner
will release the body soon

49:19.920 --> 49:22.400
so if you could get him
ready, that'd be great.

50:02.640 --> 50:04.320
Someone stamped on him.

50:12.360 --> 50:15.960
Hypothermia masks the body's
natural responses to violence,

50:15.960 --> 50:18.800
so the bruising's taken a while to
develop, and in the process,

50:18.800 --> 50:21.120
it's mimicked other causes of death.

50:21.120 --> 50:22.400
What are you saying?

50:22.400 --> 50:25.440
Well, the assault could have played
a much more significant part

50:25.440 --> 50:27.240
in Jay's death
than we first thought.

50:46.160 --> 50:49.560
Jay was assaulted in the exercise
yard and then left in the fridge

50:49.560 --> 50:52.280
to die, AND we can place
Scott Weston at the assault

50:52.280 --> 50:54.720
with his bloody fingerprint. Can we?

50:54.720 --> 50:58.600
That's not even enough to pin the
assault on him, let alone murder.

50:58.600 --> 50:59.720
There's something here.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.480
Look - this is the boot impression
on Jay's body,

51:04.480 --> 51:07.160
an interruption
in the original pattern.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.360
Please get Scott Weston's footwear.

51:11.360 --> 51:14.000
If we have something else
to link him to Jay's assault

51:14.000 --> 51:16.800
then the CPS
can charge him with something.

51:21.120 --> 51:23.680
You've reached Pamela Weston.
Please leave a message.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.480
Damn! They must have
started already.

51:32.760 --> 51:35.760
Where are you going?
To the case review.

51:35.760 --> 51:36.960
Is that a good idea?

51:36.960 --> 51:39.520
Once they see what Scott Weston has
really been up to,

51:39.520 --> 51:41.560
then his appeal
will hold no water whatsoever.

51:41.560 --> 51:45.400
At least wait until I've collected
the evidence, please!

51:45.400 --> 51:48.160
Let's take some time
to review this properly, yeah?

51:48.160 --> 51:50.760
Well, it's either
his footwear or it isn't.

51:50.760 --> 51:52.400
Just call me as soon as you know.

52:39.120 --> 52:42.320
We are here today to consider
if it's in the public's interest

52:42.320 --> 52:45.920
to allow an appeal application
to commence

52:45.920 --> 52:48.960
for one Scott David Weston.

52:56.840 --> 52:59.120
Dr Lawson, if you could begin.

53:14.000 --> 53:18.040
It is my privilege to speak
on behalf of this young man.

53:21.880 --> 53:25.160
The potential new evidence
I will discuss today

53:25.160 --> 53:29.120
will demonstrate that Scott Weston
should have been tried

53:29.120 --> 53:32.760
under the banner
of diminished responsibility.

53:36.840 --> 53:40.240
Has it started yet?
It's just about to.

53:40.240 --> 53:42.640
Is Pamela Weston here?
What is it?

53:42.640 --> 53:46.040
I have proof that implicates
Scott in Jay's death - look.

54:09.320 --> 54:12.600
In light of new evidence,
the decision has been made

54:12.600 --> 54:14.720
to postpone today's case review.

54:14.720 --> 54:16.600
On what grounds? For how long?

54:16.600 --> 54:19.360
Well, just until the new evidence
can be fully examined.

54:25.280 --> 54:28.320
What did you say to him? Eh?

54:41.320 --> 54:42.680
Liar!

54:42.680 --> 54:45.160
I have done nothing!

54:45.160 --> 54:47.000
Nothing wrong!

54:47.000 --> 54:48.040
Liar!

54:57.560 --> 54:58.840
"Having a great time,

54:58.840 --> 55:01.720
"don't wish you were here,
not missing you at all."

55:01.720 --> 55:04.360
Don't tell me. Clarissa?

55:15.680 --> 55:17.040
No!

55:18.200 --> 55:20.600
No, that can't be right.
What is it?

55:20.600 --> 55:23.120
It's Jay's immunology results.

55:23.120 --> 55:25.440
His mast cell tryptase
is off the chart.

55:27.920 --> 55:30.760
That means the laryngeal
mucosal oedema wasn't caused

55:30.760 --> 55:34.760
by the hypothermia or the assault.
Then what? It was a result

55:34.760 --> 55:39.720
of angioedema, which is a response
to an acute anaphylactic reaction.

55:39.720 --> 55:41.200
He wasn't having a panic attack.

55:41.200 --> 55:44.360
No, he was having
an allergic reaction. Shit!

55:44.360 --> 55:46.600
Anything in his notes
to say he had allergies?

55:46.600 --> 55:48.120
No, nothing.

55:48.120 --> 55:51.240
So he didn't die from the assault.

55:51.240 --> 55:52.840
Scott didn't kill him.

55:52.840 --> 55:55.080
Well, no, not necessarily. Nikki.
They were cellmates.

55:55.080 --> 55:56.680
They knew everything about
each other.

55:56.680 --> 56:00.200
If Scott knew that James had an
allergy, he could have... Just stop.

56:00.200 --> 56:02.600
Can't you see what you're doing?
You're allowing yourself

56:02.600 --> 56:04.400
to lead the evidence
where YOU want it to go.

56:14.240 --> 56:16.000
Hello?

56:16.000 --> 56:17.480
Yes, this is Dr Alexander.

56:17.480 --> 56:19.840
Oh, hi.

56:19.840 --> 56:21.680
Yeah, what's the address?

56:23.080 --> 56:24.120
What?!

56:26.280 --> 56:27.840
No! What is it?

56:29.880 --> 56:31.160
It's Pamela Weston.

57:46.440 --> 57:53.680
# Testator silens

57:56.120 --> 58:02.960
# Costestes e spiritu

58:02.960 --> 58:10.360
# Silentium. #
