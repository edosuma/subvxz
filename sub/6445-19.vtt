WEBVTT

00:19.061 --> 00:23.395
Don't tell me I missed the special
4:00 am. pre-dawn tour.

00:23.816 --> 00:27.684
You know, your current machinations
have forced you to conduct business...

00:27.861 --> 00:29.647
...outside regular business hours.

00:29.822 --> 00:31.437
I suppose I'd ﬁnd it comforting...

00:31.615 --> 00:33.822
...that you're checking up
on every move I make.

00:33.992 --> 00:37.701
What is it you ﬁnd so compelling about
these tunnels abandoned for decades?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.953
I'm spearheading
a water puriﬁcation program.

00:40.124 --> 00:42.615
A research would've assured you
it's public knowledge.

00:42.793 --> 00:46.786
Please, spare me. How long have you
been scouting the tunnels, huh? Months?

00:46.964 --> 00:49.080
There's something down here
important to you...

00:49.258 --> 00:51.874
...more important than
the approval from eco-enthusiasts.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.087
Don't worry, Dad.

00:53.262 --> 00:56.800
l have land to conquer above sea level
before I take on the undemorld.

00:56.974 --> 01:00.842
And what unknown world will be host
to Project Ares?

01:07.276 --> 01:08.732
Hey.

01:09.153 --> 01:11.519
This is a restricted area.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.742
Mr. Luthor, you're right on time.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.904
Do you mind telling me what the hell
you're doing here?

01:22.541 --> 01:23.872
Love to.

01:24.042 --> 01:27.000
In fact, I've already arranged someplace
a little more private.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.708
You need to pack your things
and leave immediately.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.167
I'm calling security.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.797
Invitation only.

01:35.971 --> 01:36.960
Lex!

01:41.310 --> 01:42.891
Dad.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.918
-Make sure they got three over here.
-Mom, what happened?

02:56.093 --> 02:58.960
They just called and said there was
some kind of explosion.

02:59.137 --> 03:02.925
-Lionel, it's Martha and Clark. We're here.
-Lex.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.136
I left Lex a message,
said it's an emergency.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.722
-He's still down there.
-He has to get into the ER.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.272
-Clark. Clark.
-Yeah.

03:09.439 --> 03:13.682
You have to help him.
Lexis being held hostage.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.527
-Do the police know what happened?
-Yes, but there's no time.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.438
-We need to move.
-One second, please?

03:19.616 --> 03:20.776
-Where is Lex?
-He's—

03:20.951 --> 03:24.193
They'll never ﬁnd him,
even if they get through the debris.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.955
It's a maze of tunnels.
You've gotta ﬁnd him, Clark.

03:29.209 --> 03:33.498
He's put something terrible into motion
down there.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.958
Lex is the only one who can stop it.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.965
Let's go.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.088
Let's go.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.817
Welcome back to subcivilization.

04:07.456 --> 04:08.787
What happened to my father?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.490
Not my problem.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.920
Never part of the plan.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.249
What do you want?

04:17.424 --> 04:19.164
My husband.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.757
U.S. Special Forces.
Weapons Sergeant Wes Keenan.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.172
The soldier you plucked
from the battleﬁeld.

04:26.350 --> 04:29.137
LuthorCorp has many subsidiaries,
Ms. Keenan.

04:29.311 --> 04:32.974
I'm fairly certain
human trafﬁcking isn't one of them.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.314
I got notice four months ago
that Wes died...

04:36.485 --> 04:39.522
...when his chopper was shot down
in Afghanistan.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.364
I knew in my heart it wasn't true.

04:44.534 --> 04:48.823
It's hard to accept,
but the heart sometimes lies.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.039
When you love somebody...

04:53.293 --> 04:56.000
...really love them...

04:56.505 --> 04:58.370
...you know when you've lost them.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.007
I don't doubt your love for your husband,
Ms. Keenan.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.219
There was no chopper crash that day.

05:07.057 --> 05:11.517
In fact, there were no chopper crashes
reported that entire month.

05:11.687 --> 05:14.520
And then the military failed
to produce his body.

05:14.690 --> 05:15.679
Uncuff me.

05:16.274 --> 05:20.017
Look, I've got some inﬂuential friends
at the Pentagon. I can help you ﬁnd him.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.901
Yeah. Nice try.

05:22.447 --> 05:26.360
You don't leave the service without learning
a thing or two about reconnaissance.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.570
I used every source I had
until a lead came up with this.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.408
Tell me, Mr. Luthor...

05:34.209 --> 05:37.246
...what does a Fortune 500 company
want with a Green Beret?

05:39.381 --> 05:41.087
Tell me.

05:43.301 --> 05:47.089
It's only a matter of time
before my security gets through.

05:47.514 --> 05:51.928
You should know their policy tends to err
on the side of shoot now, ask later.

05:53.311 --> 05:58.021
Except schematics for these tunnels
don't exist on any city blueprints.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.524
And I've rigged all ﬁve miles with C4.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.653
You see...

06:10.078 --> 06:12.694
...I learned how to be all I could be...

06:13.123 --> 06:15.956
...in explosives ordnance control.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.619
Discharged for having a short fuse.

06:22.299 --> 06:25.132
If you think I'm lying,
why don't you just kill me?

06:25.302 --> 06:27.133
Then I'd be back to square one.

06:28.346 --> 06:32.464
Besides, I'm willing to bet this little project
you're doing down here...

06:32.642 --> 06:37.306
...whatever you're doing with Wes,
it's worth more to you than your life.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.393
You decide.

06:40.859 --> 06:44.067
If I don't speak to Wes in 20 minutes...

06:44.237 --> 06:45.317
...it will all be gone.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.370
What's wrong, Mr. Luthor?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.664
Haven't you ever done anything crazy
for love?

07:15.560 --> 07:16.891
Chloe, any news on Lex?

07:17.062 --> 07:20.850
No. The police captain nixed the rescue
efforts until they can de-bomb the area.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.107
But that could take forever.
Lionel said these tunnels are endless.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.986
Which means Lex and our GI Jane
will be gone before they get through debris.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.021
So Lionel was right.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.282
Lex could die if I don't go down there.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.660
Don't look to me for encouragement.
After what he did to my mom...

07:35.831 --> 07:39.415
...I don't mind the idea of him cohabitating
with the rats for all of eternity.

07:39.584 --> 07:40.664
Trust me, Chloe.

07:40.836 --> 07:44.875
I've had moments where I thought the world
would be a better place without him, but--

07:46.299 --> 07:49.041
You don't get to choose
who you're gonna save.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.794
Not if you're Clark Kent.

07:52.722 --> 07:56.556
Besides, whatever is in those tunnels
may be the ﬁrst step in taking Lex down.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.103
I suggest you beat the bomb squad
to the entrance...

07:59.271 --> 08:02.479
...and human-wrecking ball on your way in
before anyone can see you.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.914
Perfect timing, MacGyver.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.045
You're gonna need those paws
to call Wes.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.753
The phones won't work this deep
in the tunnel system.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.792
Mine will.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.085
Take it.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.096
Take it.

08:39.603 --> 08:43.437
Without Wes, my life is over.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.606
When you meet someone that can
pull you out of the trenches...

08:46.776 --> 08:48.767
...you don'tjust give up on them.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.356
It's not that easy.

08:51.531 --> 08:55.615
Put him on the phone.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.277
Please. Let me hear his voice.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.322
-I can't call your husband.
-Do you wanna die down here?

09:01.499 --> 09:04.912
Look, we're running out of time.
Dial the damn phone.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.622
He's dead!

09:09.049 --> 09:11.381
Wes didn't die in a crash.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.293
He was shot at close range
by an M60 ﬁrearm.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.463
The bullets pierced his lungs,
his liver and his heart.

09:17.641 --> 09:22.101
LuthorCorp tried to save him with an
experimental procedure, but it was too late.

09:22.771 --> 09:26.855
Look, your husband endured
a prolonged and unsettling death.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.265
I'm
sorry

09:29.444 --> 09:31.400
But the lie was easier than the truth.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.232
No.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.660
No.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.832
Deactivate the explosives.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.873
Let's both get out of here alive.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.504
It's preprogrammed.

09:57.722 --> 10:01.556
I won't stop them
just like you can't stop this.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.915
I'm glad you came, Lana.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.375
Any word on Lex?

10:33.967 --> 10:35.298
Not yet.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.175
I can't imagine what's going
through your mind...

10:38.346 --> 10:41.213
...but I know it would mean a lot
to Lionel that you're here.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.257
Maybe some tea will help
with the nerves.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.927
Let me go. I could use some air.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.616
I wanna see him.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.368
I'm sorry, but the patient's
being prepped for surgery.

11:04.539 --> 11:05.574
You don't understand.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.832
My husband is missing,
and Lionel is the last person who saw him.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.584
You know, I realize this is an incredibly—

11:11.755 --> 11:14.542
Doctor, if my husband doesn't survive...

11:15.759 --> 11:20.469
...the man lying in that room is the only
family I have left.

11:22.891 --> 11:26.600
Please, just one minute.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.265
One minute.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.715
I understand you're in a lot of pain.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.467
Good.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.108
You knew what Lex was doing to me.

12:17.404 --> 12:21.898
Orchestrating a fake pregnancy
and making me believe that I lost a baby.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.989
And you still trapped me in a marriage
with him.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.406
I didn't know then what Lex--

12:30.583 --> 12:32.744
Save your oxygen.

12:33.628 --> 12:36.495
You wouldn't wanna jeopardize
your surgery.

12:37.298 --> 12:41.632
With Lex missing, it turns out that I'm
in charge of your medical decisions today.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.013
Looks like I'm not the only one
who's trapped.

12:49.018 --> 12:53.182
Why did you threaten to use Clark's
weakness against him if I didn't marry Lex?

12:56.985 --> 12:58.020
Tell me.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.454
If I killed you right now, I'd be free.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.051
Give me one reason why I shouldn't.

13:25.889 --> 13:30.053
I'm protecting Clark.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.891
Mrs. Luthor, we need to take him
to surgery now.

13:51.998 --> 13:55.832
Captain, Lex Luthor's Porsche
was parked at the tunnel entrance.

13:56.586 --> 14:00.249
We searched the vehicle and found this
in the trunk. It might hold some answers.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.924
Thank you, ofﬁcer.

14:02.091 --> 14:05.424
-That's part of a crime scene.
-We need to take that case as evidence.

14:05.595 --> 14:09.884
Of course, as soon as I see your warrant
to search my husband's vehicle.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.431
Please, call me as soon as you have
any news.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.300
Lex?

14:55.478 --> 14:56.979
Lex.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.443
Clark?

15:07.323 --> 15:08.654
What are you doing here?

15:09.325 --> 15:10.610
Your dad sent me.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.316
He's alive?

15:15.164 --> 15:17.120
And you got through
when nobody else could.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.623
No one else is trying, Lex.

15:19.085 --> 15:23.374
Police called off the rescue team when they
found this place was rigged with explosives.

15:25.675 --> 15:30.840
The entire tunnel system is scheduled
to detonate in 14 minutes.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.589
Is there a way to deactivate it?

15:34.767 --> 15:37.509
If you're trained in plastic explosives,
be my guest.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.182
Come on.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.690
Clark.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.590
Can you see me?
All right, be sure I'm in the frame.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.629
-All right.
-You got the background too?

16:56.808 --> 16:58.594
-Yes.
-Great.

16:58.768 --> 17:02.386
Greetings from Patagonia,
the most beautiful place on earth.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.145
-What is that?
-What?

17:06.109 --> 17:07.895
I don't see anything.

17:24.127 --> 17:27.961
You were the last person I ever expected
to be pulling shrapnel out of.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.542
I saw what happened when I
stabbed you with that chisel, Clark.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.632
The thing accordioned
like it hit solid rock.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.761
I don't know why I needed to believe
that you were more than human.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.426
Nothing's ever good enough for you, Lex.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.061
Yeah, well, the truth would have been.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.735
You may be ﬂesh and blood...

17:49.902 --> 17:52.439
...but you've been hiding secrets
from me since we met.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.282
You never trusted me.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.485
Would it have mattered?

18:00.788 --> 18:03.165
What are you really doing down here
anyway, Lex?

18:03.332 --> 18:07.450
Trying to ﬁnd ways to exploit the people
that have different abilities than you?

18:12.508 --> 18:15.170
There's no gray area with you, is there?

18:15.344 --> 18:17.005
It's either all good or all evil.

18:17.180 --> 18:20.297
Did you even try to see my humanity
before you decided I had none?

18:20.475 --> 18:23.763
I did, Lex. And look where we are.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.119
Clark, come on.

19:15.446 --> 19:16.435
Clark.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.818
Come on.

19:23.412 --> 19:26.245
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.435
Clark, come on.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.486
Come on. Get up.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.718
Hey, Clark, it's me again.
Where are you?

20:22.889 --> 20:27.258
I feel like your stalker ex-girlfriend,
even though I was never your girlfriend.

20:27.435 --> 20:29.642
It was an analogy, a bad one.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.599
I'm sorry. This is awkward.
Okay, call me. Bye.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.606
Hold up. That second blast dropped
another 10 feet of rubble.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.317
Does that mean
you haven't found Lex Luthor?

20:38.487 --> 20:39.988
Have you found anyone yet?

20:40.156 --> 20:41.612
The inner tunnels caved.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.364
After those explosions
the area is completely unstable.

20:44.535 --> 20:46.912
There's no way anyone's
getting in there by hand.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.909
What's on your vest?

20:51.083 --> 20:54.325
Dust, from meteor rocks.
It's all over the place down there.

21:10.645 --> 21:14.513
It's another dead-end.
We have to try another tunnel.

21:34.502 --> 21:37.665
Lex, these ceilings aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.544
We have to go back.

21:41.217 --> 21:43.128
You know we don't have time for that.

21:44.345 --> 21:47.052
Something tells me no one else knows
about these tunnels.

21:48.766 --> 21:51.007
If by no one you mean Lana...

21:51.185 --> 21:54.393
...l'm sorry, but I don't bore her
with the daily minutiae of my work.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.554
You mean you don't trust her.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.562
I know that's what you've
always wanted to believe.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.569
But Lana's the ﬁrst person in my life
I actually do trust.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.526
Then why'd you do it, Lex?

22:07.660 --> 22:08.900
Do what?

22:10.454 --> 22:12.740
Why'd you force her to marry you?

22:15.835 --> 22:18.918
I saw Lana the day of the wedding.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.874
She was gonna leave you.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.343
What'd you do to her?

22:29.056 --> 22:30.717
I don't know.

22:34.270 --> 22:38.434
The answer must have gotten lost
in that dark abyss we call my soul.

22:40.151 --> 22:43.814
I mean, what would I know about holding
my breath before a congregation?

22:43.988 --> 22:47.276
Praying the love of my life
wouldn't leave me at the altar.

22:49.869 --> 22:53.282
Not being sure on that day was
the hardest thing I've ever had to endure.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.113
Now, you can believe that or not.

22:56.959 --> 23:00.451
I stopped expecting you to act
like a friend a long time ago.

23:04.258 --> 23:06.965
Were we ever really friends, Lex?

23:09.555 --> 23:11.170
I don't know.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.632
I have nothing to compare it to.

23:16.979 --> 23:19.812
You were the only real friend
I've ever had, Clark.

23:22.443 --> 23:25.150
Then somewhere along the way,
you saw me as your nemesis...

23:25.321 --> 23:27.437
...and turned your back on me.

23:51.514 --> 23:54.005
Lex, get this off of me.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.821
Don't leave me here.

24:15.704 --> 24:16.784
Lex!

24:23.420 --> 24:25.376
Lex!

24:26.549 --> 24:28.210
Lex.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.443
Hey.

24:57.621 --> 25:01.409
I've been calling you all morning.
I thought you'd be with search and rescue.

25:01.584 --> 25:04.246
I thought I'd be more useful here.
Any news?

25:05.129 --> 25:07.461
No, that's the problem.
Because I'm not a Luthor...

25:07.631 --> 25:09.963
...no one will talk to me.
What have they told you?

25:10.134 --> 25:12.250
That they'll tell me
when they know something.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.551
Damn it.

25:14.722 --> 25:18.931
Clark went into those tunnels a little while
ago and I haven't heard from him since.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.265
Clark's down there?

25:24.440 --> 25:25.429
He went down to help.

25:25.608 --> 25:27.940
And now even the bomb squad
can't ﬁnd a way in.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.275
But he'll be okay, right?

25:32.573 --> 25:34.109
I don't know.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.024
But he's--

25:38.245 --> 25:40.031
I mean, he's Clark.

25:44.668 --> 25:48.786
Lana, whatever it is that you know or think
you know about Clark, he's not invincible.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.955
-He has a--
-Weakness.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.416
Look, Lana...

25:53.594 --> 25:57.928
...he will die if we don't ﬁnd a way
in there soon.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.893
I think I know another way in.

26:16.659 --> 26:19.651
Exactly when did you learn how
to pole-vault over Lex's ﬁrewall?

26:19.828 --> 26:21.864
If Lex was gonna
look over my shoulder...

26:22.039 --> 26:25.327
...it was time for me
to start looking over his.

26:26.335 --> 26:28.997
Are those the blueprints for the tunnels?

26:32.841 --> 26:36.254
You were sitting on the Holy Grail
all morning and you didn't tell anyone?

26:36.428 --> 26:39.215
I thought you said
there wasn't much time.

27:05.207 --> 27:08.620
Did you really think I was gonna
let you die alone down here, Clark?

27:11.380 --> 27:13.837
I guess you never knew me at all.

27:25.978 --> 27:29.061
The last cave-in exposed a hatch.
Come on.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.300
Go.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.160
We got two. We got two.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.621
Good book?

31:22.464 --> 31:26.628
I prefer nonﬁction. Much more exciting.

31:30.055 --> 31:34.640
I hear Lex made it out unscathed.

31:34.935 --> 31:39.975
You must be thrilled.
Both the Luthors alive and well.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.895
I'm not here to talk about Lex.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.943
What I want right now are answers.

31:53.078 --> 31:56.286
First you tell me that you're gonna
kill Clark if I don't marry Lex.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.163
And now you're telling me
that you're protecting him?

31:59.334 --> 32:00.915
What the hell is going on?

32:05.424 --> 32:08.211
Clark is a very lucky young man...

32:08.385 --> 32:11.092
...to have someone
that loves him the way you do.

32:15.517 --> 32:20.432
Your love was the only thing that I could
use to keep Clark out of harm's way.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.847
And you close to Lex.

32:23.025 --> 32:25.016
I don't understand.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.351
What harm?

32:28.155 --> 32:31.192
What's Lex doing
and why am I a part of it?

32:34.745 --> 32:37.703
You must trust me, Lana...

32:37.873 --> 32:41.115
...because Clark's life depends on it.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.172
I wonder how Martha Kent
would handle hearing...

32:49.343 --> 32:52.005
...that you used her son
as a bargaining chip.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.591
Tell me what you know.

33:04.775 --> 33:09.895
Well, I see you've embraced wholeheartedly
what it means to be a Luthor.

33:17.621 --> 33:18.781
Chloe.

33:18.955 --> 33:22.413
I've X-rayed these tunnels a dozen times.
They seem to lead to Reeves Dam.

33:22.584 --> 33:26.543
Maybe so, but if Lex was willing to go up
against Tomb Raider for them...

33:26.713 --> 33:29.329
...I can't retire my reporter's
notebook just yet.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.749
I don't understand
how you thought to come here.

33:31.927 --> 33:34.964
-Lex said no one knew those tunnels, even—
-Lana?

33:36.890 --> 33:38.596
She led search and rescue out here?

33:44.856 --> 33:47.108
I guess I had it all wrong.

33:48.110 --> 33:51.648
This whole time I thought that Lex
had forced her into that marriage...

33:52.906 --> 33:54.442
...but now I don't think he did.

33:56.076 --> 33:59.443
Don't give up on your hunch
just yet, Clark.

34:00.789 --> 34:03.747
Lana knew about the entrance
to those tunnels the whole time...

34:03.917 --> 34:07.785
...and it wasn't until she heard you're down
there that she magically produced them.

34:08.922 --> 34:11.413
Lana was gonna let Lex die down there?

34:13.343 --> 34:16.801
I think the Luthor mansion
has a lot more secrets than we realize.

34:36.032 --> 34:37.943
The police found this.

34:38.452 --> 34:41.444
I guess they really wanted to get into it.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.998
I took it away from them
as fast as I could.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.495
Thank you.

34:49.212 --> 34:53.000
Well, I'm gonna cuddle up with a movie.
Any genre preference?

34:55.469 --> 34:57.084
I think I'll pass.

34:57.262 --> 35:00.595
Okay. Well, good night.

35:05.437 --> 35:09.521
Did you see Clark on our wedding day
and tell him you didn't wanna marry me?

35:17.491 --> 35:19.027
Did you?

35:21.703 --> 35:23.364
Yes.

35:26.917 --> 35:29.454
But only because I needed
someone to talk to.

35:32.047 --> 35:35.289
I knew there was something wrong
with the baby. I could feel it.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.711
I thought you wouldn't love me.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.379
And I didn't wanna lie.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.233
I wanted to say something.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.394
I did.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.862
But you loved our baby so much.

36:05.247 --> 36:06.987
Just one look at our nursery...

36:07.165 --> 36:10.578
...and I knew that you had
an entire life planned.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.832
School.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.372
Play dates.

36:22.931 --> 36:26.264
How we were gonna be
the best parents in the world.

36:26.434 --> 36:32.020
But how could I stand at that altar,
in front of all of those people...

36:32.607 --> 36:34.768
...and say that everything
was gonna be okay...

36:34.943 --> 36:37.935
...when I knew something
was seriously wrong?

36:40.323 --> 36:43.611
What kind of a person
would lie like that?

36:50.709 --> 36:53.951
Nothing could have stopped me
from loving you.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.298
Nothing.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.552
That's why I married you.

37:08.101 --> 37:10.808
I wish I was that strong.

37:14.065 --> 37:18.308
If someone lied to me like that,
they would lose my love forever.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.038
I don't know what I did to deserve you.

37:58.902 --> 38:01.268
You didn't come in for dinner.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.736
I thought you might be hungry.

38:03.907 --> 38:06.444
Thanks, I didn't realize how late it was.

38:08.078 --> 38:11.411
Any idea what Lex and Lionel
were doing in those tunnels?

38:11.706 --> 38:13.617
Itjust doesn't add up.

38:13.792 --> 38:17.205
I mean, we have budgets, funding,
plans, construction.

38:17.379 --> 38:18.994
It's almost as if Lex was--

38:19.172 --> 38:22.039
Building a water puriﬁcation system.

38:23.718 --> 38:27.051
Maybe this is the one time Lex
was actually telling the truth.

38:30.058 --> 38:33.300
Clark, what really happened down there?

38:35.105 --> 38:37.562
When Lex pulled me out of that rubble...

38:39.192 --> 38:42.730
...I saw a glimpse
of something I hadn't seen in years.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.197
My friend.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.610
I know you two went through a lot.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.074
But so much has happened.

38:58.753 --> 39:02.587
Sometimes, as hard as it is,
you have to let go.

39:07.929 --> 39:09.794
But you didn't.

39:10.974 --> 39:13.932
After everything that Lionel's done,
you stood by him today.

39:14.102 --> 39:16.388
That doesn't mean I trust him.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.603
I wish I could.

39:18.773 --> 39:22.812
And even though I honestly believe
he's made an effort...

39:22.986 --> 39:25.602
...no one can completely change
who they are.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.112
But at least you gave him that chance.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.490
Mom, what if part of who Lex is...

39:37.042 --> 39:39.033
...is because of me?

39:40.420 --> 39:42.411
What if I gave up on him too soon?

39:42.589 --> 39:45.080
You'll never give up on anyone, Clark.

39:46.092 --> 39:52.008
Because your greatest strength
might also be your greatest weakness.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.389
Your hope.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.278
You'll be pleased to hear
the prototype is just days...

40:12.452 --> 40:15.489
...from reaching
its fullest functioning capacities.

40:24.089 --> 40:27.752
Thanks to your wife,
I almost died for you.

40:28.676 --> 40:32.260
Let's hope there's nothing
you can't do for me.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.052
