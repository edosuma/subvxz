00:05.750 --> 00:07.541
Erica: (Sleepy moan)

00:09.166 --> 00:10.958
They say we should strive
to forgive and forget.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.583
Too often we do neither.

00:14.583 --> 00:16.666
Instead, we hold grudges,

00:16.666 --> 00:18.833
we stay mad.

00:28.916 --> 00:31.250
- (Humming)

00:31.250 --> 00:33.208
- Good morning! (Pan clatters)

00:33.208 --> 00:34.708
Oh! God!
- Erica, what the hell!

00:34.708 --> 00:36.166
- I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

00:36.166 --> 00:37.750
- (Half laughs) I'll survive.

00:37.750 --> 00:39.291
- Please, please, forgive me?
- Forgive you?

00:39.291 --> 00:40.791
Ask my big toe to forgive you.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.250
Sorry, Mr. Toe.
Look, you know what?

00:42.250 --> 00:44.375
You, you have to forgive me
because tomorrow is Yom Kippur.

00:44.375 --> 00:45.875
- Oh, Happy New Year.

00:45.875 --> 00:48.250
- No, that's...
that's Rosh Hashanah.

00:48.250 --> 00:49.916
- Kidding.

00:49.916 --> 00:51.750
Yom Kippur,
the day of atonement.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.666
You fast and apologize for stuff

00:53.666 --> 00:55.875
and people have to forgive you.

00:55.875 --> 00:57.791
Even my big toe.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.125
Robin Goldberg,
my first girlfriend,

00:59.125 --> 01:00.458
she taught me a few things.

01:00.458 --> 01:02.541
- Oh. Sorry.

01:02.541 --> 01:04.125
(Kissing)

01:04.125 --> 01:06.416
Hurt, anger, betrayal.

01:06.416 --> 01:08.750
These things are hard
to forgive, much less forget.

01:08.750 --> 01:10.208
(Telephone ringing)

01:11.750 --> 01:13.291
- Barbara Strange, line 2.

01:13.291 --> 01:14.416
- No, don't get it.
Don't-don't-don't-don't-DON'T!

01:14.416 --> 01:16.291
I don't wanna deal with it.
I don't wanna deal with it.

01:16.291 --> 01:18.500
- "It?" as in her mission
to reunite you with Sam?

01:18.500 --> 01:20.166
- (Sighs) She wants me
to come over for dinner.

01:20.166 --> 01:21.916
I mean, she gets...

01:21.916 --> 01:24.166
She gets dinner
and Dad gets the service,

01:24.166 --> 01:26.291
and no one's ever happy.

01:26.291 --> 01:28.250
So I just decided
that I'm not gonna do it.

01:28.250 --> 01:30.291
- Then let's not go;
let's do something else.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.583
- Okay, like what?

01:32.583 --> 01:34.666
- I don't know,
whatever you want.
My credit card will provide.

01:34.666 --> 01:36.833
- Oh...

01:36.833 --> 01:38.375
(Kissing)

01:38.375 --> 01:40.208
- I can't, sorry.
I have to go to Shul.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.291
Um, actually, Yom Kippur,

01:43.291 --> 01:45.541
it's the one holiday that
I actually take seriously.

01:45.541 --> 01:46.958
- Well, why can't you take
Hanukkah seriously?

01:46.958 --> 01:48.250
That seems like
a pretty fun holiday.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.000
- (Laughing)

01:51.000 --> 01:52.500
- What're you doing?

01:52.500 --> 01:55.833
- I'm gonna make you breakfast
for a change.

01:55.833 --> 01:57.875
- Actually, I think breakfast
can wait

01:57.875 --> 02:00.375
because, doctor,
my foot's really sore

02:00.375 --> 02:03.125
and I think make-up sex
is the only cure.

02:03.125 --> 02:05.458
- Oh, well...

02:05.458 --> 02:08.416
Um, I think that we should
take care of that then.

02:08.416 --> 02:10.291
- Okay.
- Immediately.

02:13.041 --> 02:15.125
(Ryan grunts playfully,
Erica laughs)

02:15.125 --> 02:16.916
(Birds chirp)

02:16.916 --> 02:18.916
Barbara: (Laughing)
Oh, that's so funny.

02:20.458 --> 02:21.958
Julianne: I mean it, you know.

02:21.958 --> 02:23.916
I mean it, I mean it. Somebody's
gotta stop that woman.

02:23.916 --> 02:26.541
- I know! (Laughs)

02:26.541 --> 02:28.750
Julianne: You're funny.
Barbara: Oh, that's too much.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.291
Oh, there she is.

02:30.291 --> 02:32.250
- Erica, where have you
been hiding your mother?

02:32.250 --> 02:35.125
She's adorable, and that cape
is... (snaps fingers) fierce.

02:35.125 --> 02:37.583
- Well, thank you.
- Mom, what a, what a surprise.

02:37.583 --> 02:39.416
- Well, I haven't been able
to reach you, sweetheart.

02:39.416 --> 02:42.458
So, I just stopped by to firm up
plans for Yom Kippur.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.833
- Uh... yeah,
machine broke down twice

02:44.833 --> 02:46.166
and milk wouldn't foam.
I'm sorry--

02:46.166 --> 02:47.666
- I'm sure it's perfect.

02:47.666 --> 02:49.458
Barbara and Julianne:
(Stifled giggles)

02:49.458 --> 02:52.000
- Okay, what's, uh...
what's going on here?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.416
- Erica is always
making us laugh.

02:53.416 --> 02:54.875
She's like our office
Jerry Seinfeld.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.541
- Well, she gets it
from my side.

02:56.541 --> 03:00.291
Julianne and Erica:
(Polite laughter)

03:00.291 --> 03:02.000
And Mom, did I mention
that I'm really busy?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.916
Just wanted show you...

03:06.333 --> 03:08.291
For the morning service,
I couldn't resist.

03:09.958 --> 03:11.458
That's great, but Mom,
I already told you

03:11.458 --> 03:13.541
that I am doing Yom Kippur
on my own tomorrow.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.458
- Oh, so you're just gonna
skip your father's sermon?

03:15.458 --> 03:17.416
You're not going to synagogue?

03:17.416 --> 03:19.375
Oh, no, I see.

03:19.375 --> 03:21.041
On the most important holiday
of the year,

03:21.041 --> 03:22.958
you have time for your father
but not for me.

03:22.958 --> 03:24.416
- Mom, that's not what
this is about, okay?

03:24.416 --> 03:26.500
I am not picking sides,
I'm just...

03:26.500 --> 03:28.375
I'm staying neutral, okay?
Like, Switzerland.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.125
- And I want my daughters
speaking to each other.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.541
- Here we go.
That didn't take long.

03:31.541 --> 03:33.083
- You know, this fight
between you two,

03:33.083 --> 03:35.666
it's reached a point where
it's destroying the family.

03:35.666 --> 03:38.000
- I think someone else
deserves credit for that.

03:39.625 --> 03:42.541
You know, no matter what I say,
it's always the same.

03:42.541 --> 03:44.375
Your father's the saint,

03:44.375 --> 03:47.416
and everything that's wrong
with the world is my fault.

03:47.416 --> 03:49.833
- Mom, I can't deal with this
right now.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.458
Look, if you wanna see me
on Yom Kippur,

03:55.458 --> 03:57.291
why don't you come
to Dad's synagogue.

03:57.291 --> 03:59.958
If it's so easy, why don't you
bury the hatchet with him? Hm?

03:59.958 --> 04:02.208
- Oh, please.
- Oh, well, No surprise there.

04:04.208 --> 04:07.041
Look, enjoy your hat.

Samantha: I can't believe
you're defending her.

04:56.166 --> 04:57.708
You know what she said to me

04:57.708 --> 04:59.541
five minutes before I was about
to walk down the aisle.

04:59.541 --> 05:01.208
- I'm not defending her,

05:01.208 --> 05:03.375
I'm just saying
she was emotional.

05:03.375 --> 05:05.333
Maybe she was being protective.

05:05.333 --> 05:07.958
- Yeah. She was being jealous.

05:07.958 --> 05:09.708
- Mmm. God,
I love these pickles.

05:09.708 --> 05:12.041
- She's jealous of the fact
that I'm with someone
and she's not.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.791
- Josh, you'll be fasting
with us tomorrow, right?

05:13.791 --> 05:16.375
- No can do, my boss put the
ixnay on taking the day off.

05:16.375 --> 05:17.750
- Oh, that's too bad.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.083
- Pass the pastrami.

05:20.541 --> 05:21.875
Thank you.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.541
Oh, no-no-no-no-no,
she's not allowed.

05:25.541 --> 05:28.125
- Josh.
- There's raw egg in
the dressing, babe.

05:28.125 --> 05:30.333
- We agreed not to say
anything.

05:30.333 --> 05:33.000
- Am I gonna be a grandmother?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.416
- Probably. I got a positive,

05:34.416 --> 05:36.291
but the blood test is on Friday.

05:36.291 --> 05:38.875
- Oh, Mazel Tov, sweetheart.

05:38.875 --> 05:40.708
(Happy laughter)

05:40.708 --> 05:42.708
- What? Can I help if
my swimmers are that good?

05:42.708 --> 05:44.291
She goes off the pill
the day we get married

05:44.291 --> 05:46.125
and - boom! - preggo.

05:46.125 --> 05:48.666
- (Laughing)
This is wonderful news.

05:48.666 --> 05:51.708
The only thing that would
make my life perfect

05:51.708 --> 05:54.291
is if my two daughters were on
speaking terms.

05:54.291 --> 05:57.083
- Mom!
- I know. She insulted you
terribly.

05:57.083 --> 05:59.666
But tomorrow is Yom Kippur,
and she is your sister.

05:59.666 --> 06:02.041
Just think about it, Samantha.

06:03.666 --> 06:05.458
Here, mom.
- Thank you.

06:06.958 --> 06:09.208
- Hey... hey, Sam.

06:09.208 --> 06:11.166
I, I still think that you made
a huge mistake marrying Josh,

06:11.166 --> 06:13.166
but... will you forgive me?

06:13.166 --> 06:15.375
No, I probably shouldn't
say that.
(Knocking, door opens)

06:15.375 --> 06:16.750
- Gefilte fish.
You know you hate it

06:16.750 --> 06:18.208
and you know I love it.
So, tomorrow...

06:19.666 --> 06:21.083
- I'm not going.

06:21.083 --> 06:23.166
- Because of Sam.

06:24.791 --> 06:26.416
You see the problem
with modern technology

06:26.416 --> 06:27.958
is the phones do just
about everything

06:27.958 --> 06:29.791
except read minds.

06:29.791 --> 06:32.083
Press your fingers
on the buttons and -

06:32.083 --> 06:34.916
Presto! - number dialed.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.625
- And say what?

06:36.625 --> 06:37.458
- Tell her you're sorry.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.833
- I wonder if it's too late
to call Ryan

06:39.833 --> 06:41.291
and go to Wonderland tomorrow?

06:41.291 --> 06:43.041
- Call Sam.
- How many times
can I apologize?

06:44.708 --> 06:48.166
Until you get through to her,
and you will, so...

06:48.166 --> 06:50.208
(Sighs) Ugh...

06:51.666 --> 06:53.166
(Phone rings)

06:53.166 --> 06:54.541
(Hard thump)

06:56.375 --> 06:57.875
- It's she who shall
not be named.

06:59.541 --> 07:01.916
- Think of the baby.
(Phone continues ringing)

07:03.375 --> 07:05.750
(Phone beeps on)

07:05.750 --> 07:09.625
- Erica.
- Uh, hey. Hi, Sam, it's...
(Stammers nervously)

07:09.625 --> 07:11.291
I mean, you probably know
why I'm calling.

07:15.708 --> 07:17.541
I'm sorry. I, I never meant
to hurt you.

07:19.166 --> 07:22.708
That was not my intention.
Please forgive me.

07:22.708 --> 07:26.833
- I'm just gonna give them
some space.
- Uh-huh.

07:26.833 --> 07:28.625
- Sam, are you gonna
say anything?

07:36.208 --> 07:38.666
- Fine. I forgive you.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.000
Okay, then we'll...
Uh, that's, that's, great.

07:41.583 --> 07:43.041
Um, I'll-I'll... (Stammering)

07:43.041 --> 07:45.208
Guess I'll see you
tomorrow then, okay?

07:46.666 --> 07:48.000
(Phones beep off)

07:50.750 --> 07:52.875
- What?
- No, I-- (clears throat)
I just love a religion

07:52.875 --> 07:54.958
where you can screw up
throughout the year

07:54.958 --> 07:57.500
and then just clean the slate
with one little phone call.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.250
Erica: This is it!

08:10.666 --> 08:13.458
Lily: Erica! Hi.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.416
And this must be Ryan.

08:15.416 --> 08:17.708
- Ryan, this is Lily Greenberg,
the Cantor.

08:17.708 --> 08:20.125
- Nice to meet you.
Cantor? Is that like a Rabbi?

08:20.125 --> 08:21.625
- Mm, more like a lead vocalist.

08:21.625 --> 08:23.416
- She sings the songs
during the service.

08:23.416 --> 08:25.083
- Why don't I take you both
inside?

08:25.083 --> 08:27.250
It's good to see you.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.333
- Your father was here
a minute ago.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.000
Oh, where is he?

08:33.375 --> 08:36.208
- Mom! You're here.
- I am.

08:36.208 --> 08:39.583
- Barbara. Welcome.
- Thank you.

08:39.583 --> 08:41.333
- Barbara.

08:41.333 --> 08:44.500
- Rabbi.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.541
- What a lovely surprise.
- I don't know why?

08:46.541 --> 08:49.916
I observe Yom Kippur
like everyone else.

08:49.916 --> 08:52.250
- Let me show you
to a good seat at the front.

08:55.916 --> 08:58.375
- Sam. Look, I'm really glad
that we got a chance to talk
last night

08:59.625 --> 09:01.750
and we're taking steps towards
working things out.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.666
- Taking steps?
More like taking advantage.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.208
- What?
- You know that when someone
asks you to forgive them

09:08.208 --> 09:09.791
on Erev Yom Kippur,
they have to do it.

09:09.791 --> 09:11.458
So, you're telling me that...

09:11.458 --> 09:12.750
your forgiving me,
that wasn't real?

09:12.750 --> 09:14.750
What, like your apology was?

09:17.333 --> 09:20.750
- Today, we honor the tradition
of Yom Kippur

09:20.750 --> 09:23.500
by looking inward,

09:23.500 --> 09:25.541
considering our year,

09:25.541 --> 09:27.416
starting afresh.
For remaining silent...

09:29.041 --> 09:31.791
- This is nice.
I'm glad we did this.

09:31.791 --> 09:33.875
- This is a great idea, Mom.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.166
Right up there
with that home perm

09:35.166 --> 09:36.625
you gave me in grade 5.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.375
- And what is it to forgive?

09:38.375 --> 09:41.833
- For the record,
I was being sincere.

09:41.833 --> 09:43.458
- Well, it's a broken record

09:43.458 --> 09:45.708
and it keeps playing
the same pathetic song.

09:45.708 --> 09:47.750
- Stop it, both of you.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.666
- I'm not doing anything.
- That's the problem.

09:49.666 --> 09:51.041
- Hey, is now really the time?
- Shhh.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.333
- Erica. Can we try
and get through this day

09:53.333 --> 09:54.750
without any of your drama?

09:54.750 --> 09:56.291
- Why is this "my drama?"

09:56.291 --> 09:58.416
- Samantha accepted
your apology.

09:58.416 --> 10:01.458
Stop picking it apart.
- This is her drama, not mine.

10:01.458 --> 10:02.791
- No it's not!
Because unlike you,

10:02.791 --> 10:04.333
not everything is about me.

10:04.333 --> 10:07.708
- Sisters, for example,
may have little in common,

10:07.708 --> 10:10.541
but the bond of sisterhood
is eternal.

10:10.541 --> 10:13.833
- Oh, that is low, Erica,
getting Dad in on it.
- What?!

10:13.833 --> 10:15.375
- Sisters, who might want
to realize

10:15.375 --> 10:18.250
that their father is delivering
a Yom Kippur sermon

10:18.250 --> 10:19.791
at this very moment.

10:19.791 --> 10:21.125
- Well, maybe you'll learn
something.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.750
- (Scoffs) Learn something?

10:22.750 --> 10:24.250
You're the one who was just
going through the motions

10:24.250 --> 10:26.833
last night on the phone.

10:26.833 --> 10:28.750
- Okay, Erica, why don't you
just apologize to your sister

10:29.375 --> 10:31.000
and mean it this time.
- That's right, mom.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.208
- You know what?
Just take her side.
- I'm not taking sides.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.916
I'm trying to save this family.

10:34.916 --> 10:38.333
- Save?! You're the one that
walked out on this family.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.916
I am sick and tired of you
judging everyone.

10:39.916 --> 10:42.250
You're the one that walked out
after Leo--

10:44.958 --> 10:46.791
You walked out on this family
when we needed you the most,

10:46.791 --> 10:49.750
so don't talk to me
about saving this family!

10:49.750 --> 10:51.666
Church goers: (Muffled chatter)

10:58.416 --> 11:00.333
(Receding footsteps)

11:09.958 --> 11:12.041
(Tight exhale)

11:12.041 --> 11:14.500
(Door opens,
Churchgoers shift awkwardly)

11:17.708 --> 11:19.208
- Sorry.

11:27.625 --> 11:30.041
(Whoosh, prayer wheel rattles)

11:30.041 --> 11:32.041
- As Philip Larkin
so poignantly wrote:

11:32.041 --> 11:34.916
"They screw you up,
your mom and dad.

11:34.916 --> 11:37.541
They may not mean to,
but they do."

11:40.833 --> 11:42.916
You know, there's a...
a wooden staircase

11:42.916 --> 11:46.416
which leads up to St. Joseph's
Oratory in Montreal

11:46.416 --> 11:50.083
and penitent Catholics climb it
on their knees,

11:50.083 --> 11:52.500
reciting a prayer at each step.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.458
- Sounds as painful
as Yom Kippur.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.250
- Well...

11:59.750 --> 12:01.208
Didn't have to be painful.

12:02.625 --> 12:04.791
Please.

12:04.791 --> 12:07.208
- Dr. Tom, I have tried
for weeks

12:09.375 --> 12:11.916
to make things right with Sam.

12:11.916 --> 12:13.875
- As the wise master from
the Dagobah swamp once said:

12:13.875 --> 12:15.916
"There is no try, only do."

12:17.500 --> 12:18.875
- Did you just quote Yoda?

12:18.875 --> 12:20.416
- (Mimics Yoda) Mm-hmm.

12:20.416 --> 12:21.833
You know, Yoda was really
just a mash-up

12:21.833 --> 12:23.958
of a lot of the Eastern
religious traditions,

12:23.958 --> 12:25.958
but primarily,
he was drawn from Buddhism,

12:27.458 --> 12:29.750
and the Buddhists...

12:29.750 --> 12:31.708
they spin these prayer wheels
while they recite the mantra

12:33.250 --> 12:35.041
which inscribed
along the side -

12:35.041 --> 12:38.250
"Om mani padme hum" -

12:38.250 --> 12:41.666
which they believe inspired
the spirit of compassion

12:41.666 --> 12:44.500
and of understanding...
and forgiveness.

12:48.666 --> 12:50.625
You wanna take it for a spin?

12:50.625 --> 12:52.541
- It's okay, I'm good.

12:54.916 --> 12:59.583
- Well, tell me about this one.
"Calling mom a total Nazi."

13:01.708 --> 13:04.125
- Not my finest moment.

13:04.125 --> 13:07.125
It was Yom Kippur, 1997.

13:07.125 --> 13:08.708
The previous year Leo had died,

13:08.708 --> 13:10.583
and we were all cranky
and starving,

13:12.625 --> 13:14.666
and someone from the synagogue
had sent a runner for my dad

13:14.666 --> 13:16.041
right before
we were about to eat

13:16.041 --> 13:18.125
and my mom, she lost it.

13:18.125 --> 13:20.666
She said, you know, that he was
spending more time at the Schul

13:20.666 --> 13:22.958
than he was with his family.

13:22.958 --> 13:24.458
And when had he tried
to stand up for himself,

13:24.458 --> 13:26.125
she, she threw down
this ultimatum -

13:26.125 --> 13:29.583
either his synagogue,
or their marriage.

13:29.583 --> 13:32.500
I mean, she was being
unreasonable and controlling
and...

13:32.500 --> 13:34.625
I was just angry and...

13:34.625 --> 13:36.416
I wanted her to stop
picking on Dad,

13:36.416 --> 13:38.000
so I called her...

13:38.000 --> 13:39.875
(Past Erica screams)
A total Nazi!

13:42.000 --> 13:44.125
And after that,

13:44.125 --> 13:46.958
she went to her sister's
for two weeks in Ottawa,

13:46.958 --> 13:48.875
and when she came back, um...
she asked for a divorce.

13:50.458 --> 13:51.875
- Of course,
you don't believe that--

13:51.875 --> 13:53.208
- That I was responsible
for their breakup?

13:53.208 --> 13:54.666
No. I... I mean,
they were headed that way

13:54.666 --> 13:56.708
for a long time, but...

13:56.708 --> 13:58.791
but when I said what I said,

13:58.791 --> 14:00.833
that day when I sided
with my dad,

14:00.833 --> 14:03.333
it, it changed my relationship
with my mom permanently.

14:04.875 --> 14:06.416
- How?
- Well, it was like...

14:06.416 --> 14:07.916
it was like, after that,
there was always two camps.

14:07.916 --> 14:10.000
There was my dad and I
on one side

14:10.000 --> 14:11.500
and Mom and Sam on the other,

14:11.500 --> 14:13.375
and it's been that way
ever since and...

14:15.041 --> 14:17.041
My relationship with my mom,
it's never recovered.

14:19.541 --> 14:21.916
If I could go back, I would--

14:21.916 --> 14:25.041
I wouldn't pick a side.
I would stay neutral.

14:25.041 --> 14:26.708
(Prayer wheel rattles)

14:26.708 --> 14:28.541
Like Switzerland.

14:28.541 --> 14:30.791
(Prayer wheel rattles)

14:32.208 --> 14:34.000
(Whoosh)

14:35.666 --> 14:37.750
- Ethan, I think Erica's
trying to cop a feel.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.000
- No, I did not.
- No?

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
- (Erica grunts)
- Hey! You have to hold
the pose for thirty seconds.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.750
That's a resounding win
for the all-star twister team

14:43.750 --> 14:45.750
of Sam, Josh and Barb.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.500
Woooo-hoo-hoo!

14:50.041 --> 14:51.791
Josh: Help me stretch it out,
babe?

14:51.791 --> 14:53.458
Thanks. That's good.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.375
(Exhales forcefully) I tell ya,

14:55.375 --> 14:57.958
I got the flexibility of a
flat-chested Romanian gymnast.

14:57.958 --> 14:59.583
- (Half laughs)

14:59.583 --> 15:01.625
- (Grunts) Just call me
Josh "the twist" MacIntosh.

15:01.625 --> 15:03.458
(High-five)

15:06.625 --> 15:08.125
(Josh chuckles)

15:08.125 --> 15:09.458
- What's in your mouth
right now?

15:09.458 --> 15:10.958
- (Chuckles) Gum.

15:10.958 --> 15:12.833
- Where'd you get gum?
- My pocket.

15:12.833 --> 15:14.208
What? It's not food.
I'm not eating anything.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.833
- You're not allowed gum.
- (Doltish imitation of Sam)
I'm not allowed gum.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.000
I'm not allowed
to watch my game.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.416
Barbara: Well, Josh--
- I'm not allowed anything.

15:19.416 --> 15:22.000
- If you wanna watch the game,
you just go in my office,
sweetheart.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.166
- It's still Yom Kippur?

15:23.166 --> 15:24.583
I think that should
be respected.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.125
- Yes, we should,
but he's not Jewish;

15:26.125 --> 15:28.750
he can do whatever he likes.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.916
- Well, Ethan isn't Jewish.
He's not asking to watch
the game.

15:30.916 --> 15:32.791
- Oh, I'm not asking.
- I don't really like
spectator sports.

15:32.791 --> 15:34.791
- Gary, just let the boys do
whatever the hell they wanna do.

15:35.583 --> 15:37.000
- Come on, it's my house.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.833
It's Yom Kippur.

15:40.875 --> 15:43.708
(Doorbell rings)
- Oh, saved by the bell.

15:43.708 --> 15:45.875
Ethan: I'll get it.

15:47.875 --> 15:50.375
- Rabbi Strange.
- What's wrong?

15:50.375 --> 15:52.125
- Uh, sorry to interrupt,
but Rabbi Neinstein is sick

15:52.125 --> 15:53.958
and we need someone
to blow the shofar.

15:53.958 --> 15:56.250
- Hear that? Someone's gonna
blow your chauffeur.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.916
- You're so gross.
- You are not leaving tonight,
Gary.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.125
- Barb, come on.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.583
It's an emergency. They need me.

16:02.583 --> 16:04.166
- We need you here!

16:04.166 --> 16:06.375
- Uh, you know, you know what?
Um, I'm sorry,

16:06.375 --> 16:07.958
but you're just gonna have
to find someone else, okay?

16:07.958 --> 16:09.416
- You're a Rabbinical student!

16:09.416 --> 16:11.708
You're not even
a full-fledged Rabbi!

16:11.708 --> 16:13.208
- Well, that's exactly
the point.

16:13.208 --> 16:15.083
They wouldn't send somebody
halfway across the city

16:15.083 --> 16:17.166
if they didn't really need me!

16:17.166 --> 16:20.041
- Bullshit. "The Rabbi's sick."

16:20.041 --> 16:22.708
How stupid do I look, Gary?!

16:22.708 --> 16:24.666
- Okay, he's gone
and it's done, all right?

16:24.666 --> 16:27.958
Let's, uh, let's just start
the game, okay?

16:27.958 --> 16:29.875
(Receding footsteps)

16:32.708 --> 16:34.791
- Mm-hmm.

16:34.791 --> 16:36.708
- "Assman" isn't a word.
- Oh, it's more than a word.

16:36.708 --> 16:38.833
It's a way of life.

16:38.833 --> 16:40.750
Right, Ethan?
- Um... yeah, I guess so.

16:42.291 --> 16:43.833
- Dad, it's your turn.

16:43.833 --> 16:45.791
- (Sighs heavily)

16:49.250 --> 16:51.791
- Oh, if you put
those letters there,

16:53.333 --> 16:54.916
you can spell "mammogram."

16:54.916 --> 16:57.125
- (Irritated sigh)
- See?

16:59.375 --> 17:01.791
- I think I'll go read.
(Irritated sigh)

17:03.250 --> 17:05.041
- Dibs.

17:05.041 --> 17:07.166
- (Clears throat uncomfortably)
- Here, Ethan.

17:07.166 --> 17:09.125
Excuse me.

17:10.708 --> 17:12.375
Mom, what're you doing?

17:12.375 --> 17:14.458
- Well, the brisket's not
gonna cook itself.

17:14.458 --> 17:16.375
No, I mean, why are you
picking a fight with Dad?

17:16.375 --> 17:19.250
- I was helping him.
- No. You know that he hates it

17:19.250 --> 17:21.000
when you stand over
his shoulder like that.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.083
- Oh, your father doesn't
have a clue

17:23.083 --> 17:24.791
what to do with those letters.

17:24.791 --> 17:26.916
And that's from years
of marijuana abuse;

17:26.916 --> 17:28.416
it fries your brain.

17:28.416 --> 17:30.375
Okay, I know, but can you
just lay off him?

17:30.375 --> 17:32.250
I mean, he stayed.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.250
You gotta give him credit
for that.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.041
I mean, would you rather
that he's, you know,

17:36.041 --> 17:39.041
still staying on the couch
smoking weed all day?

17:39.041 --> 17:41.250
I know that you're not
a huge fan of his synagogue,

17:41.250 --> 17:43.583
but at least he's found
his passion.

17:43.583 --> 17:45.541
- Oh, Erica.

17:47.916 --> 17:51.083
You don't know
what you don't know.

17:51.083 --> 17:54.458
Just... just stay out of it,
sweetheart.

17:54.458 --> 17:55.916
- Yeah, fine. Yeah, okay.

17:55.916 --> 17:57.541
I mean, if that's...
if that's what you want.

17:57.541 --> 18:00.791
- What I really want is my big
roasting pan from the basement.

18:00.791 --> 18:02.208
- Okay.

18:07.208 --> 18:08.875
(Light knock)

18:11.416 --> 18:14.041
- Your mother elbow you
out of the game too?

18:14.041 --> 18:15.875
- Dad. I think that...

18:18.000 --> 18:19.916
you know, she just really wants
us to spend the day together.

18:19.916 --> 18:22.000
- I think it's a little more
complicated than that.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.458
- Well, can't you just
give her a break?

18:23.458 --> 18:25.208
I mean, she's in there cooking

18:25.208 --> 18:26.666
and I think that
it's the first time

18:26.666 --> 18:28.291
that she's cooked
a big family meal since...

18:33.041 --> 18:34.750
- Since your brother died.

18:36.958 --> 18:39.041
- Your mother asked for this?
- Mm-hmm.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.666
(Brief kiss)

18:49.291 --> 18:50.958
(Foil pan rustles)

18:52.666 --> 18:54.625
- Oh, thank you.

18:56.208 --> 18:57.583
- Is there anything
I can help with?

18:57.583 --> 18:59.083
- Well, it's not yet sundown.

18:59.083 --> 19:02.166
Are you sure you wanna be
working?

19:02.166 --> 19:03.875
- A man helping his wife
make dinner,

19:03.875 --> 19:07.375
I think I'll be forgiven.

19:07.375 --> 19:09.750
(Peeler rattles)

19:21.250 --> 19:23.416
Erica: Oh, Mom,
the brisket looks delicious.

19:23.416 --> 19:24.791
Barbara: Thank you.
(Family "mm's" in agreement)

19:26.375 --> 19:27.958
(Telephone rings)
- I'll get it.

19:29.541 --> 19:31.875
(Telephone rings,
phone beeps on)

19:31.875 --> 19:34.250
- Hello.

19:34.250 --> 19:37.000
Oh, I see.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.458
Lily, I've already said
that I can't come.

19:39.458 --> 19:42.208
Because I'm spending tonight
with my family.

19:43.666 --> 19:46.000
Okay, bye.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.291
(Telephone beeps off)

19:55.125 --> 19:57.958
(Forced exhale)

19:57.958 --> 20:00.083
If the Shul needs you that
badly, maybe you should go.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.416
- No, I'm here. I wanna do this.

20:04.416 --> 20:06.333
- But if you go
and deal with that,

20:06.333 --> 20:11.250
then maybe they'll stop calling
and leave us alone.

20:11.250 --> 20:14.000
- (Sighs) Are you sure?
- Dinner will be waiting.

20:17.541 --> 20:19.041
- I'll be right back.

20:19.041 --> 20:20.708
An hour tops.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.958
- Thanks, mom.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.833
- There. Meals for a week.
- Oh, thanks, mom.

20:33.458 --> 20:34.875
- You should get going,
it's very late, sweetie.

20:36.541 --> 20:39.083
- Where's Dad? Seems like
he's been gone for ages.

20:39.083 --> 20:42.125
Erica: He probably just got
caught up with the post
Yom Kippur crowd.

20:42.125 --> 20:45.291
You know how Mrs. Zweig
likes to talk.

20:45.291 --> 20:47.583
Muah!
- Good night, sweetie.
Get home safe.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.333
- Thank you. That was great.
Ethan: Thanks.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.250
- Love you!
- Thanks for diner.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.875
(Door closes, Taxi rumbles)

20:58.458 --> 20:59.833
- This is it.
I'll just be a sec.

20:59.833 --> 21:01.333
My dad's probably starving.

21:01.333 --> 21:02.958
- I'll be here,
sleeping off my Manishewitz.

21:02.958 --> 21:05.333
- (Chuckling) Okay.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.291
(Door bangs shut)

21:11.083 --> 21:13.250
Lily: Then stop saying things
you don't mean.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.041
Gary: I do mean it.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.208
Lily: No, you don't.

21:17.208 --> 21:19.083
Why don't you just
tell me the truth?

21:19.083 --> 21:20.541
You didn't mean
to fall in love with me,

21:20.541 --> 21:22.500
it just happened
and now you're stuck.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.333
- Lily, I have a family,
a life I built...

21:27.041 --> 21:29.250
that I can't just
walk away from!

21:29.250 --> 21:31.125
- Gary, look at why
this all happened.

21:31.125 --> 21:34.208
You are unhappy all the time!

21:34.208 --> 21:37.166
- I'm not leaving her, Lily.
This thing we're doing
is wrong.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.250
- Whoa-whoa-whoa, what's wrong?

21:46.250 --> 21:48.250
Nothing. Um, I just...

21:48.250 --> 21:50.666
I forgot something at my parents
and I have to go back.

21:50.666 --> 21:52.333
- Erica, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

21:52.333 --> 21:53.958
Yeah, let's just, um...
Drop you off first, okay?

21:55.458 --> 21:56.791
(Taxi rumbles away)

21:58.333 --> 21:59.833
(Lock and keys rattle)
- Mom!

22:01.333 --> 22:02.833
(Door bangs shut)

22:02.833 --> 22:04.083
Mom?!
(Light clicks on)

22:05.833 --> 22:07.875
Mom?!

22:36.208 --> 22:37.500

a Rabbi

22:41.291 --> 22:42.750
and then cheats on his wife

22:42.750 --> 22:44.416
a few months after
his son has died?

22:44.416 --> 22:46.458
- Uh, well, you tell me.

22:46.458 --> 22:48.750
- And she knew. All along.

22:48.750 --> 22:51.833
I mean... how is that possible?

22:51.833 --> 22:54.333
- People surprise you.
- No, but these aren't people,
they're my parents,

22:54.333 --> 22:56.750
and my dad...

22:56.750 --> 22:58.583
That's not my dad. He's not
impulsive or... underhanded.

23:01.375 --> 23:03.000
- Oh?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.541
- He's not. I know my dad.

23:04.541 --> 23:06.541
And it's always my mom
that's been more like that.

23:06.541 --> 23:09.291
- Apparently, not in this case.

23:09.291 --> 23:12.750
- Why would she cover for him?

23:12.750 --> 23:14.625
- Maybe you don't know
your parents

23:14.625 --> 23:17.333
as well as you think you do.

23:17.333 --> 23:19.375
- Maybe... maybe I don't
know them at all.

23:19.375 --> 23:21.333
- Maybe that's something
you might wanna work on?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.458
I think you're gonna need this.

23:24.458 --> 23:26.583
(Velcro rips,
tambourine jingles)

23:28.250 --> 23:31.000
- Why the hell would
I need a tambourine?

24:06.125 --> 24:08.583
I saw you! Dr. Tom! Dr. Tom!

24:08.583 --> 24:11.125
- Hey! Peace, Sister Starlight.

24:11.125 --> 24:13.166
- Sister starlight?
What is this place?

24:13.166 --> 24:14.875
- This is wilds of Ontario.

24:14.875 --> 24:17.541
Oh, and you and I,
we run this camp by the way.

24:17.541 --> 24:19.666
Far out, huh?
- Look, I've had some benders,

24:19.666 --> 24:21.833
but I, I... I don't remember
this bush party.

24:21.833 --> 24:23.500
- No, I know.
I don't expect you to.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.458
This is the hippie commune
that your parents came to

24:25.458 --> 24:27.625
before they were married.

24:27.625 --> 24:29.625
- I'm sorry, but I'm not
following.

24:29.625 --> 24:32.416
- It's 1974.

24:33.875 --> 24:35.208
- '74, but...

24:36.833 --> 24:38.791
How? 'Cause I'm not,
I'm not born until '76.

24:38.791 --> 24:40.750
- (Chuckles) You know,
the Hindu's,

24:40.750 --> 24:42.791
they believed we exist
before we were born;

24:42.791 --> 24:46.333
that our consciousness
floats around out there.

24:46.333 --> 24:48.541
- Okay, you've totally lost me.

24:48.541 --> 24:50.166
- Okay, simple version?

24:50.166 --> 24:52.416
Some traditions suggest
that we choose our parents

24:52.416 --> 24:55.000
for what we have to teach them,
or, you know, vice versa.

24:57.666 --> 24:59.875
- So you're telling me that I
chose Gary and Barbara Strange?

25:00.625 --> 25:02.541
Wow, bad choice.
- Oh, yeah? You figure?

25:02.541 --> 25:05.250
Well, maybe you should check
that out for yourself.

25:07.541 --> 25:09.291
- Oh my God, mom...

25:09.291 --> 25:11.666
- Yeah, in the flesh.

25:11.666 --> 25:13.291
Why don't you go talk to her?

25:13.291 --> 25:15.000
- Oh, and-and say what?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.833
Hey, don't, you know,
don't marry Dad 'cause
he's a big cheater.

25:16.833 --> 25:18.458
- Erica, your whole life,

25:18.458 --> 25:20.041
all you've seen is your
parents at sea, right?

25:21.541 --> 25:22.958
Battling the storm.

25:22.958 --> 25:24.375
Well, you see that?

25:24.375 --> 25:25.875
Right here, right now,

25:25.875 --> 25:28.291
that is the calm
before the storm.

25:28.291 --> 25:30.291
That is year zero
of the Gary/Barb union.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.750
You should check it out.
Maybe there's a piece
of the puzzle there

25:33.750 --> 25:36.375
that you're missing.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.833
Go on.

25:38.833 --> 25:40.750
And hey... just be cool.

25:43.416 --> 25:46.750
(Hum of chatter, someone sings
and plays guitar nearby)

25:51.250 --> 25:52.833
- Think it's gonna fall?

25:52.833 --> 25:55.708
- (Half laughs) Starlight, hi.

25:55.708 --> 25:59.416
Gary says you can see
a whole menagerie of animals.

25:59.416 --> 26:01.625
Maybe it's me,
but all I see are clouds.

26:01.625 --> 26:03.625
Yeah. Smoke another, Gary,
right?

26:03.625 --> 26:05.666
Barbara and Erica: (Laugh)
Barbara: Here.

26:05.666 --> 26:08.083
Sit. Have some lemonade.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.000
It is all natural.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.416
Nothing but lemon, water,
and stevia root.

26:13.416 --> 26:15.500
Gary has gone totally organic.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.541
Back to basics for us, the way
mother nature intended, right?

26:20.208 --> 26:22.708
- (Coughs) Right. It's groovy.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.708
- You know, Gary says--
- You know what? Never mind
about Gary.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.958
I just, I honestly, I can't...

26:26.958 --> 26:29.333
I can't believe that
you're here camping.

26:29.333 --> 26:30.916
- Why?

26:30.916 --> 26:33.000
- Because you don't even
like it... like at all!

26:33.000 --> 26:34.125
- Oh, it's maybe
a little chilly...

26:34.125 --> 26:36.833
- Plus, you hate the way that
the food, it always tastes
like smoke

26:36.833 --> 26:38.333
and that it's damp,

26:38.333 --> 26:39.791
and how you wake up
every morning

26:39.791 --> 26:42.500
drenched in that gross combo
of sweat and dew.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.291
And you, you know, pretending
to like all this stuff for him

26:45.291 --> 26:47.958
that can't be good.

26:47.958 --> 26:50.250
In the long term, I mean.
- Starlight, everyone has
their differences.

26:50.250 --> 26:52.083
It's how you handle them
that counts.

26:53.708 --> 26:55.375
- Sometimes, I really,
I just don't get you.

26:55.375 --> 26:56.875
- We only met yesterday.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.000
I know, but I know you, Barb.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.666
I know that you don't eat
chicken in restaurants,

26:59.666 --> 27:01.833
your favorite color is teal,

27:01.833 --> 27:03.958
and you would rather spend
the night in a five-star resort

27:03.958 --> 27:06.791
than out here,
under the actual stars.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.625
- You are really tripping me
out. How did you know that?

27:09.708 --> 27:11.000
- I, uh... um...

27:12.625 --> 27:14.250
read auras of...
I'm, uh, I'm psychic.

27:15.333 --> 27:16.875
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

27:16.875 --> 27:19.583
- (Half laughs) Far out.

27:19.583 --> 27:21.125
Listen, Starlight,

27:21.125 --> 27:24.166
Don't think I don't appreciate
your concern. I do.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.291
It's just... opposites attract.

27:26.291 --> 27:28.500
The fact that Gary
is so different is...

27:28.500 --> 27:30.416
it's what I love about him.

27:32.625 --> 27:35.458
- Mm, this lemonade,
it's very delicious, but cold,

27:35.458 --> 27:37.666
and I would kill for a cup
of coffee right now.

27:37.666 --> 27:39.166
- Oh, well, unfortunately,

27:39.166 --> 27:41.791
coffee is kinda forbidden
at the camp,

27:41.791 --> 27:44.458
which is a problem because
I really need my morning
cup of joe.

27:44.458 --> 27:50.416
- Yeah, me too. I'm...
I'm like my mom like that.

27:50.416 --> 27:51.875
Woman: Sister,
I have what you need.

27:51.875 --> 27:53.750
- Oh, caffeine!

27:53.750 --> 27:55.416
(Coffee sloshes)

27:57.208 --> 27:59.583
- Thanks.

27:59.583 --> 28:01.416
- There's my sexy mama.

28:01.416 --> 28:04.333
- (Giggles)

28:04.333 --> 28:07.458
(Passionate kiss)

28:07.458 --> 28:09.333
- Mm, mm, stop. Gary, stop.

28:10.791 --> 28:12.375
- Hi.

28:12.375 --> 28:14.500
- So, brother Jones
is organizing a vision quest.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.916
Now, I know that
you're gonna pass,

28:15.916 --> 28:18.250
but how about you, Starlight?
Are you in?

28:18.250 --> 28:19.750
- Uh, what's involved?

28:19.750 --> 28:21.500
- We open ourselves
to the universe

28:21.500 --> 28:24.041
and all of our lies and masks...

28:24.041 --> 28:25.666
they're-they're stripped away
and our truth is revealed.

28:26.708 --> 28:28.833
- Sounds interesting...
Hey, what about you, Barb?

28:28.833 --> 28:30.833
Are you up for a,
for a vision quest?

28:30.833 --> 28:32.666
- Oh, uh...
- Oh, come on,
you're gonna love it!

28:34.333 --> 28:37.208
- Okay, let's go commune
with the universe.
- Woo-hoo!

28:37.208 --> 28:39.250
- Come on.

28:41.625 --> 28:43.458
(Bubbles bubble)

28:43.458 --> 28:45.833
- Leather to bind the heart

28:45.833 --> 28:47.958
and sweetgrass
to restore your spirit.

28:47.958 --> 28:49.750
- Mm-hmm, whatever.

28:49.750 --> 28:51.791
You're kinda full of it,
aren't you?

28:51.791 --> 28:54.500
- Who isn't?
- Uh, Barbara, your wife.
The woman that you're ignoring

28:54.500 --> 28:56.500
while you're off kick-starting
the men's movement out here

28:56.500 --> 28:58.125
with your junkie friends.

28:58.125 --> 29:00.500
- We're all one, Starlight,
one big collective soul.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.125
So you getting mad at me

29:02.125 --> 29:03.708
is just like you getting mad
at yourself.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.166
- It's always about you,
isn't it,

29:05.166 --> 29:07.250
and your spiritual angst,
and your needs.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.833
I mean, do you honestly think
that's gonna last forever?

29:11.833 --> 29:13.416
Huh? Her looking at you
with stars in her eyes

29:13.416 --> 29:14.833
and you just calling
the shots all the time?

29:14.833 --> 29:16.583
You keep deluding yourself and
let's see where it leads you.

29:16.583 --> 29:18.125
- I'm not deluding myself.

29:18.125 --> 29:19.958
I love Barb with my whole heart,

29:19.958 --> 29:23.083
my whole self, you know?

29:23.083 --> 29:25.458
- What happened to make you
so bitter?

29:25.458 --> 29:27.416
- My parents.
- Mine too.

29:27.416 --> 29:29.125
I used to get really bent
out of shape about it,

29:29.125 --> 29:32.458
until I realized that
they don't have the answers.

29:32.458 --> 29:34.791
They never did.
They're just like us, you know?

29:34.791 --> 29:37.916
Just trying to figure it
all out.

29:37.916 --> 29:39.333
Are you always perfect,
Starlight?

29:39.333 --> 29:41.333
Do you always make
every right choice?

29:42.916 --> 29:44.958
(Low hum of chatter,
drums pound)

29:44.958 --> 29:47.833
- Come on, it's starting.

29:53.666 --> 29:55.750
Woman: Erica.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.875
(Drums beat, flames crackle)

29:57.875 --> 30:00.708
- I look in the fire
and I see myself.

30:00.708 --> 30:02.333
All these feelings
burning inside of me...

30:03.833 --> 30:05.916
Mm... like flames.

30:05.916 --> 30:07.500
(Drums beat)

30:09.125 --> 30:10.750
- I look into the fire
and I feel... alone.

30:12.625 --> 30:14.750
Like, like no one understands me

30:14.750 --> 30:16.833
and no one ever will.

30:18.541 --> 30:20.458
(Drums beat)

30:22.666 --> 30:25.000
- Um... I look into the fire
and...

30:26.875 --> 30:28.625
I...

30:30.208 --> 30:31.750
I think I'll pass.
- Oh, come on.

30:31.750 --> 30:34.125
This is a circle of trust.
Open yourself up.

30:34.125 --> 30:35.791
Look into the fire
and find the truth.

30:37.541 --> 30:39.041
- (Sighs)

30:43.708 --> 30:45.458
I look into the fire and...

30:46.916 --> 30:48.958
I see... flames.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.333
And... I feel...

30:55.458 --> 30:57.500
(Sighs) I'm sorry, I can't.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.375
- Come on, Barb, just try,
all right?

30:59.375 --> 31:01.000
Just... let go.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.875
- I don't really want to talk
about this right now

31:02.875 --> 31:04.458
in front of everyone.

31:04.458 --> 31:06.000
- You're-you're safe here.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.625
Say what you gotta say.
Speak your truth, Barbara.

31:10.625 --> 31:12.333
- Well, honestly,
what I feel is...

31:13.833 --> 31:16.041
like I hate it here.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.083
Like it is all
a bunch of bullshit,

31:18.083 --> 31:19.583
and I am cold,

31:19.583 --> 31:21.250
and I am sitting
on this dirty log,

31:21.250 --> 31:24.125
and I feel nauseous,
and I just wanna leave.

31:24.125 --> 31:25.958
- You feel that?

31:25.958 --> 31:27.541
Why didn't you tell me
that before?

31:27.541 --> 31:29.916
- Because you wouldn't
have listened.

31:29.916 --> 31:33.791
Sometimes... (sighs)
you don't listen to me.

31:33.791 --> 31:35.750
(Flames crackle)

31:38.458 --> 31:40.041
(Whoosh)

31:40.041 --> 31:41.666
Barbara: Erica.

31:45.750 --> 31:47.375
- Oh my God.

31:48.791 --> 31:50.166
Mom?

31:55.041 --> 31:57.416
- No, oh, no, Mom.
Wait, wait, don't go!

31:57.416 --> 31:58.833
- Starlight, there's no--
There's no one there, okay?

31:58.833 --> 32:00.125
I'm gonna get you back
to the van.

32:00.125 --> 32:01.833
It's okay...

32:01.833 --> 32:03.833
Yeah, I know.

32:05.625 --> 32:07.708
- Come on.
- Take it easy.
- It's okay.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.625
Starlight, it's okay.

32:12.916 --> 32:15.208

32:28.166 --> 32:30.250

32:30.250 --> 32:32.250

you pushed me away.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.458
- Well, now you've ruined
everything.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.083

Don't fight!

Yosemite Scarrow's fault.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.750
I told you she was no good.

32:42.750 --> 32:45.333
She looks and acts like one
of Charles Manson's girls.

32:45.333 --> 32:46.875
- That's a horrible thing
to say.

32:46.875 --> 32:49.625
- No-no-no-no.
You love each other.

32:49.625 --> 32:52.833
You have to hold on
to the precious love,

32:54.500 --> 32:56.833
and you have to remember that
when you're mad at him

32:56.833 --> 32:58.875
because he's smoking weed
all day

32:58.875 --> 33:00.208
and he wants to become a Rabbi.

33:00.208 --> 33:02.125
- Gary? A Rabbi?

33:02.125 --> 33:03.583
- And you have to remember that

33:03.583 --> 33:06.083
when she's picking on you
all day

33:06.083 --> 33:07.916
because all she's trying to do
is make you a better man.

33:10.166 --> 33:13.166
Okay. Okay, okay.

33:13.166 --> 33:15.208
- Yosemite,
what was in that tea?

33:15.208 --> 33:18.083
- Tea? (Giggles)

33:18.083 --> 33:19.666
It was mushrooms.

Barb and I are gonna travel
to Tibet.

33:29.750 --> 33:31.708

- It's all helping.

33:31.708 --> 33:33.416

33:33.416 --> 33:36.208
For a while there you thought
that stump was a gnome.

33:36.208 --> 33:37.458
- It was a gnome, trust me.

33:37.458 --> 33:39.166
- And all that other stuff
you were saying -

33:39.166 --> 33:40.416
the Berlin wall falling?

33:40.416 --> 33:42.083
- A phone you can carry around

33:43.833 --> 33:45.458

33:57.083 --> 34:00.000
- One thing we can agree on.
If it's a boy, it'll be Leo.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.833

(Passionate kissing)

34:20.625 --> 34:22.958

you two lovebirds alone.

34:22.958 --> 34:24.958
Uh... Thanks.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.333
- (Audible gulp)

34:45.958 --> 34:47.291
Hoo.

34:54.041 --> 34:56.416
- Do you need help, mom?
- Absolutely not.

34:56.416 --> 34:58.250
I have everything
under control.

34:58.250 --> 34:59.583
(Cell phone rings)
- Ugh.

35:01.208 --> 35:03.083
- You should answer that.
- It's Yom Kippur.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.000
- Maybe it's Josh?
- Josh knows it's Yom Kippur.

35:07.500 --> 35:10.083
(Cell phone ringing)
Oh, he's probably calling
to say he's running late.

35:10.083 --> 35:12.083
Hi, honey,
it's not sundown yet.

35:13.708 --> 35:15.125
What?

35:16.875 --> 35:18.875
Mom made the kugel
especially for you.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.666
(Disappointed breath)
You're not coming at all.

35:25.333 --> 35:27.000
Can't you just stop by later
for dessert or something?

35:29.416 --> 35:30.958
Okay. Okay.

35:33.125 --> 35:35.875
Fine. (Phone beeps off)

35:38.458 --> 35:40.833
Josh says hi, and he's sorry
but he can't make dinner.

35:40.833 --> 35:42.875
- Oh. Well, that's too bad.

35:42.875 --> 35:45.333
- Mom, don't guilt me out.
- Who's guilting you out?

35:45.333 --> 35:48.333
- He has to work, okay?
It's not the end of the world.

35:51.291 --> 35:52.833
Josh has a high-pressure job

35:52.833 --> 35:55.541
and he would be here
if he could be.

35:55.541 --> 35:58.958
- I know he would, sweetheart,
I know that.

35:58.958 --> 36:01.083
Well, it just means
more kugel for us.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.583
- And so it is that we bring
another Yom Kippur to an end;

36:12.583 --> 36:14.375
that we may begin again
with a clean slate.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.416
Everyone rise, please.

36:17.416 --> 36:19.333
(Loud shuffle of pews)

36:19.333 --> 36:20.958
Lily: Teruah gedolah.

36:22.958 --> 36:25.375
(Sounds the shofar)

36:32.291 --> 36:33.875
(Blast of shofar ends
with a squeak)

36:33.875 --> 36:36.000
(Heavy breath) G'mar tov.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.958
- (Claps)
- (Whispers) You don't clap.

36:43.166 --> 36:47.708
- Erica, you okay?
- I'm fine. I will be fine.

36:47.708 --> 36:51.208
Um, Ryan, can you wait for me
out in the parking lot?

36:51.208 --> 36:52.583
- Okay?

36:56.208 --> 36:58.291
- Dad, we need to talk
in private.

36:58.291 --> 37:00.958
- Excuse me.

37:00.958 --> 37:03.291
What's going on, Erica?

37:03.291 --> 37:05.125
You're gonna have to work
this out with your sister.

37:05.125 --> 37:08.416
- I don't want to talk
about Sam, okay?

37:08.416 --> 37:10.375
Dad, I'm so confused right now.

37:10.375 --> 37:12.166
I don't even know
how to say this.

37:12.166 --> 37:14.166
- You wanna sit down?

37:14.166 --> 37:17.000
- Look, I know there was a time
that you were crazy about mom.

37:18.458 --> 37:19.958
- Of course,

37:19.958 --> 37:21.416
I married her, didn't I?
(Chuckles)

37:21.416 --> 37:22.833
- So then what happened?
- People change, Erica.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.291
They grow apart
for all sorts of reasons.

37:26.291 --> 37:27.958
- And is that what
you told yourself

37:27.958 --> 37:30.000
when you cheated on her
with Lily?

37:31.583 --> 37:34.416
- She told you?
- No, she didn't,

37:34.416 --> 37:35.958
but you should have.

37:35.958 --> 37:38.208
- Jesus.

37:38.208 --> 37:40.333
- Are you still with her?
- No.

37:40.333 --> 37:43.250
We ended it 11 years ago.

37:43.250 --> 37:46.291
So you had 11 years
to say something,

37:46.291 --> 37:48.083
but instead you let me think

37:48.083 --> 37:49.458
that it was Mom that walked out,

37:49.458 --> 37:51.166
instead of the other way around.

37:51.166 --> 37:53.916
- Your mother insisted that...
you and your sister not know.

37:53.916 --> 37:56.333
She also insisted that
you stay home from Shul,

37:56.333 --> 37:58.166
but that didn't stop you.
- That was different.

37:58.166 --> 37:59.958
- Dad... (welling up)

37:59.958 --> 38:03.041
I took your side because
I didn't know the truth.

38:08.083 --> 38:09.583
- Erica, wait.
- No.

38:09.583 --> 38:12.291
I have to go make things right
with Mom.

38:12.291 --> 38:16.416
And if you meant or believed
anything you said on the bima,

38:16.416 --> 38:18.250
you would be doing
the same exact thing.

38:22.916 --> 38:25.208
(Receding footsteps)

38:32.583 --> 38:34.291
- Samantha, honey, dinner's
ready.

38:34.291 --> 38:35.833
(Heels clack) Sa-

38:37.250 --> 38:39.000
- Hi.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.375
- Hello.

38:41.375 --> 38:42.916
- Mom, um...

38:44.375 --> 38:45.916
I'm sorry.

38:48.583 --> 38:50.250
Honestly, I just, I really--
I didn't know until today

38:51.083 --> 38:53.291
how much you've sacrificed
for Sam and I.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.708
- Well, going to your father's
Shul is not a sacrifice.

38:59.041 --> 39:03.083
At least, not until you
humiliated me in public.

39:03.083 --> 39:06.291
I mean, all the times
that took Dad's side.

39:06.291 --> 39:08.541
And you knew he was having
an affair and you...

39:08.541 --> 39:10.166
and you never used
that against him.

39:12.375 --> 39:14.166
- He told you?
- No, but I found out,

39:15.833 --> 39:17.541
and it doesn't really matter
how I found out, but...

39:19.166 --> 39:20.666
what I don't understand is,

39:20.666 --> 39:23.333
why you would protect him,
after what he did?

39:23.333 --> 39:25.000
- Gary wasn't a great husband,

39:27.208 --> 39:29.125
but he was an amazing father.

39:30.708 --> 39:33.083
You and Samantha
lost your brother.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.333
I didn't want you to lose
your father as well.

39:38.291 --> 39:40.125
- Mom. (Welling up)

39:41.541 --> 39:42.916
- Oh...

39:44.458 --> 39:46.583
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

39:50.416 --> 39:52.416
Go get cleaned up for dinner.

39:52.416 --> 39:55.291
- 'Kay. (Sniffles) 'Kay.

40:07.083 --> 40:08.500
Sam, hey.

40:08.500 --> 40:09.833
- Hey.

40:11.333 --> 40:13.291
Do you have a tampon?

40:13.291 --> 40:16.791
- Yeah, of course.

40:16.791 --> 40:18.541
(Tampon wrapper crinkles)
There you go.

40:22.500 --> 40:26.125
We weren't gonna say anything
until after the 1st trimester.

40:26.125 --> 40:28.333
- Oh, Sam...

40:31.416 --> 40:33.458
Hey, listen, if you need
anything,

40:33.458 --> 40:35.625
you know, I'm here for you.

40:38.083 --> 40:40.375
- Thank you.

40:49.125 --> 40:50.541
(Door clicks shut)

40:58.041 --> 41:00.000
(Whoosh)

41:03.250 --> 41:06.291
- What a day, or... days,
or... whatever.

41:08.208 --> 41:10.041
You know, there was a...
there was a part of me

41:10.041 --> 41:11.500
that really thought...

41:11.500 --> 41:13.416
that Sam and I weren't gonna
be able to work it out.

41:13.416 --> 41:16.541
- Well, no limitation,
no timetable,

41:16.541 --> 41:19.458
no last chance
when it comes to forgiveness.

41:19.458 --> 41:22.500
Of course, the question is,
now that you've been forgiven,

41:22.500 --> 41:25.375
can you turn around
and forgive someone else?

41:25.375 --> 41:27.250
- My father.

41:27.250 --> 41:29.125
And I know that the answer
to that should be "yes,"

41:29.125 --> 41:31.750
but the truth is...

41:31.750 --> 41:33.666
I just don't know.

41:35.333 --> 41:36.875
- Einfuhlung.

41:36.875 --> 41:38.625
- Sorry?
- It's a German word.

41:38.625 --> 41:41.541
It means the you in me
and the me in you.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.416
- Oh God. You sound like my dad.

41:43.416 --> 41:44.875
- Well, he's a smart guy
your father.

41:44.875 --> 41:46.333
- He's a hypocrite.
- He's human.

41:46.333 --> 41:48.291
Well, it does not make it
any easier to forgive him.

41:48.291 --> 41:51.625
- True, but nobody said
it was easy.

41:51.625 --> 41:54.416
Go on, eat.
Break your fast, Erica.

41:55.958 --> 41:58.541
Your day of atonement is over.

42:03.333 --> 42:04.750
(Door opens)

42:04.750 --> 42:06.166
- L'chaim, my darlings.

42:06.166 --> 42:07.750
- L'chaim, Mom.
- L'chaim.

42:07.750 --> 42:10.166
(Glasses clink)

42:10.166 --> 42:13.416
- No family is perfect,
or stays that way.

42:13.416 --> 42:15.291
It changes shape
over the years

42:15.291 --> 42:18.500
and sometimes loses
its original structure.

42:18.500 --> 42:20.458
- Whatever else happened today,
it was worth it

42:22.125 --> 42:23.666
to get you two ladies
at this dinner table.

42:25.333 --> 42:28.750
- Every sin, every slip up,
is another opportunity to grow.

42:28.750 --> 42:31.458
They give us the chance
to change the things we can

42:31.458 --> 42:32.833
and to accept
the things we can't.

42:32.833 --> 42:34.958
(Doorbell rings)

42:34.958 --> 42:36.625
- Josh wouldn't ring
the doorbell.

42:36.625 --> 42:38.625
- Here. I'll get it.

42:38.625 --> 42:41.083
- You sit and eat. I'll get it.

42:43.416 --> 42:45.333
(Door shuts)

42:47.250 --> 42:49.583
- Hello. I'm sorry to interrupt.

42:51.041 --> 42:52.750
Barb, I...

42:54.708 --> 42:56.833
- Come, sit.

42:56.833 --> 42:58.750
Come. You must be hungry, Gary.
