00:01.369 --> 00:04.338
ADULT ADAM:
Back in the '80s, I was
obsessed with musical theater.

00:04.372 --> 00:06.840
From Jesus Christ Superstar
to Phantom of the Opera,

00:06.874 --> 00:08.476
I loved the stage.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.777
At least, most of the time.

00:09.810 --> 00:12.313
People,
the moment has arrived.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.947
My dearest theater students

00:13.981 --> 00:16.384
and kids who do stage crew
for some reason...

00:16.417 --> 00:17.618
I work best
in the shadows.

00:17.651 --> 00:18.752
No one cares, Dan.

00:18.786 --> 00:21.789
This year,
William Penn Academy
will be performing

00:21.822 --> 00:24.992
the most important musical
of our time,

00:25.025 --> 00:26.660
Fiddler on the Roof!

00:27.995 --> 00:29.397
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:29.430 --> 00:30.831
Meh.
"Meh"?

00:30.864 --> 00:33.167
Since when does Adam Goldberg
"meh" a musical?

00:33.201 --> 00:36.304
Fiddler's just so heavy
and dreary and Russian.

00:36.337 --> 00:39.006
I'm more into the happy
toe-tapping musicals,

00:39.039 --> 00:40.941
like Music Man
or Pippin

00:40.974 --> 00:42.343
or not Fiddler.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.678
So, you're not gonna
even audition?

00:44.712 --> 00:46.647
I wanted us to be
Golde and Tevye.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.382
They're the power couple
of peasant Russia.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.951
Like Luke and Laura,
but sadder.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.153
Sorry, girl.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.422
As long as it's
Fiddler on the Roof,
I ain't doing it.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.689
You're doing it.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.958
But you hate all
musicals with every fiber
of your being.

00:57.991 --> 01:00.094
Of course!
They're long and boring,

01:00.128 --> 01:02.830
and they're about cats
or painting wagons.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.032
But Fiddler on the Roof?
The best.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.335
Well, it reminds me
of Pops' sad relatives

01:07.368 --> 01:08.702
who visit us
from the old country.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.105
Their clothes are all schmutzy
and smell like turnips.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.541
Adam, you have to do
this play.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.277
Our people have a few special
things we're all proud of...

01:16.310 --> 01:19.747
Sandy Koufax, The Fonz,
Sammy Davis Jr.,

01:19.780 --> 01:22.250
and Fiddler on the Roof.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.717
Gah, fine!

01:23.751 --> 01:25.553
I'll audition to be
in the chorus or something.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.720
Absolutely not!

01:26.754 --> 01:28.822
In my house,
it's Tevye or nothing.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.258
I don't want to be
the lead!

01:30.291 --> 01:31.625
You're gonna be Tevye,
damn it!

01:31.659 --> 01:34.762
Now put on
my grandfather's old
Russian coat and sing for me.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.063
It's so heavy.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.366
Like the weight of a man
with too many daughters.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.100
How do I already smell?
How?

01:40.134 --> 01:41.602
That's the smell
of greatness.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.737
Now show me your shimmy.
I don't wanna shimmy.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.039
Shimmy for your father,
damn it. Like this.

01:46.073 --> 01:47.808
It's in our blood
and our shoulders.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.480
If that's how you shimmy,
damn it,

01:52.513 --> 01:54.114
we got to go back
to fundamentals.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.116
Come on,
put your game face on. Do it!

01:56.150 --> 01:57.785
Stop riding my back, man!

01:57.818 --> 01:59.019
I'm doing my best.

01:59.052 --> 02:00.621
Stop.
What's going on in here?

02:00.654 --> 02:03.224
Not now, Barry.
Adam's form is off.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.858
I got to coach some sense
into the kid.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.228
Sounds to me like a father
demanding perfection

02:07.261 --> 02:08.929
and telling his son
he's not good enough.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.464
That's exactly
what's happening.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.566
Damn it, I want that!
Why?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.502
'Cause it's my dream
to have a sports dad

02:14.535 --> 02:17.471
who spazzes out in the stands
and calls me a lazy failure

02:17.505 --> 02:18.606
who needs to play harder.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.040
Great. He's yours.
Take him.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.642
Oh, no.
If we're gonna win this part,

02:21.675 --> 02:23.244
we got to buckle down
and dig in.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.878
Fine, forget sports!

02:24.912 --> 02:26.980
Whatever your dumb thing is,
I'll do it.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.115
It's Fiddler on the Roof.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.683
Great. I'll go on the roof
right now with a fiddle.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.051
You don't even have one!

02:31.084 --> 02:32.920
I'm gonna go
bongo on the roof.
Where's the ladder?

02:32.953 --> 02:34.688
Do not get the ladder.
Ladder it is.

02:34.722 --> 02:37.758
Do not go in that garage
and touch my ladder, moron!

02:37.791 --> 02:38.926
I mean it!

02:38.959 --> 02:40.528
Too late,
theater sports dad.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.162
I'll send a rope down
for my bongos.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.933
* I'm twisted up inside

02:45.966 --> 02:48.336
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

02:52.039 --> 02:53.441
* I don't know the future

02:53.474 --> 02:56.810
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:56.844 --> 02:59.146
ADULT ADAM:
It was November 1st,
1980-something,

02:59.179 --> 03:02.950
and my mom and sister
were helping Geoff prep
for his SATs.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.452
I failed, didn't I?
Oh, God, I failed.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.619
I'm not going to college!

03:05.653 --> 03:06.720
I'm gonna live
under a bridge,

03:06.754 --> 03:07.988
and I'm gonna have to use
the wall as a bathroom.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.390
Dude, I am here for you.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.558
No matter how dumb

03:10.591 --> 03:11.825
the test says you are.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.562
Okay, let's see.
You got...

03:14.595 --> 03:15.996
1,540!

03:16.029 --> 03:17.865
Babe, I am so sorr...
Wait, what?

03:17.898 --> 03:19.567
1,540?
Holy poop!

03:19.600 --> 03:21.168
Yeah,
"Holy poop" is right.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.304
I can go to college now!
And a wide variety.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.505
Yes. Wow.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.507
That's, like,
a super good score.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.008
Is it wrong?
It must be wrong.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.109
I mean,
how is that possible?

03:29.142 --> 03:30.311
Well, I mean,
I get straight As

03:30.344 --> 03:31.579
and I study all the time.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.046
Wait, did you not know
I was smart?

03:33.080 --> 03:35.716
No! I mean, I do hear you talk
about homework a lot,

03:35.749 --> 03:37.518
but all I see is
your cute, dumb face.

03:37.551 --> 03:41.289
Oh, young Geoffrey,
your mother is going to plotz.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.856
Aside from grandchildren,

03:42.890 --> 03:46.560
braggable SAT scores
are the greatest gift
a child can give.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.129
I know. I can for sure
go to UCLA now.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.131
Wait, but that UC
is in LA.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.133
And LA stands
for Los Angeles.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.201
It's where my dad went.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.503
And doing what
other people want

03:55.536 --> 03:56.837
makes me happy
'cause I'm a pleaser.

03:56.870 --> 03:57.905
Bye, babe. Love you.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.907
1,540.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.074
Holy !

04:01.108 --> 04:02.510
I can't believe this.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.044
That stupid goof-ass genius

04:04.077 --> 04:05.913
is gonna leave Philly
and never look back.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.381
Oh, well, can you blame him?

04:07.415 --> 04:10.584
Everybody in LA eats sushi and
has hair just like their dog,

04:10.618 --> 04:13.186
and the cops are so nice
they can't solve crimes,

04:13.220 --> 04:14.488
so Axel Foley helps 'em.

04:14.522 --> 04:15.956
That's all
from Beverly Hills Cop.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.157
Oh, such a good movie.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.359
It has my name

04:18.392 --> 04:22.029
and that Axel Foley
has an infectious giggle.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.098
Stop talking
about Axel Foley!

04:25.132 --> 04:27.501
I will not let Geoff
go to LA.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.337
Oh, squishy...

04:29.370 --> 04:31.905
Some things are just
out of your control.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.642
Not if I make sure
he tanks those SATs.

04:34.675 --> 04:37.511
Shame on you for even thinking
such a thing.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.112
If it's one rule I live by,

04:39.146 --> 04:41.382
it's that you can't smother
your loved ones.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.816
Um, hello?

04:42.850 --> 04:45.118
Remember, I wanted to apply
to college in California?

04:45.152 --> 04:47.287
You tried to sabotage my SATs

04:47.321 --> 04:49.923
by teaching me
fake vocabulary words.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.625
I swear on my life

04:51.659 --> 04:54.462
nothing like that
has even remotely happened.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.765
I came up with some more vocab
cards for you to memorize.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.767
Thanks, Mom.
"Scubulence"?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.102
ADULT ADAM:
Yep, my mom taught Erica
these absurd words

05:02.135 --> 05:03.837
so she'd tank her test
and never leave.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.105
That's a weird word.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.976
I have made enormous strides
as a human being and mama

05:09.009 --> 05:10.210
over the past few years.

05:10.243 --> 05:11.912
Truly, I have changed.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.246
No, you haven't.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.683
You've had the same
insane hair, sweaters,

05:15.716 --> 05:17.851
and obsession with
your kids since forever.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.087
Erica.
One of my biggest regrets

05:20.120 --> 05:23.657
was trying to fool you
with those fake SAT cards.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.660
Trust me, do not make
the same mistake.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.095
Damn it, you're right.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.631
I can't do to Geoff
what you did to me.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.699
I could never stoop
that low.

05:31.732 --> 05:32.833
ADULT ADAM:
And yet, she did.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.569
That day, my sister went
full Beverly Goldberg

05:35.603 --> 05:37.270
to keep the love of her life
close by.

05:37.304 --> 05:38.539
Plorpf! Yes!

05:38.572 --> 05:40.608
ADULT ADAM:
While my sister was ready
to con Geoff,

05:40.641 --> 05:42.976
I was trying to bargain my way
out of Fiddler.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.879
Mr. Goldberg, welcome to
what I can only assume

05:45.913 --> 05:48.416
is the single most important
moment of your young life.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.851
Um, I'm thinking this year
we don't do this dance

05:50.884 --> 05:52.019
where I put you
in the awkward position

05:52.052 --> 05:53.487
of having to give me
a good part

05:53.521 --> 05:55.022
even though
I can't sing or act.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.458
But won't your mom just march
down here and yell at me

05:57.491 --> 05:59.326
when I give you
a lousy part because
of your screechy voice?

05:59.359 --> 06:00.661
I give you my word,

06:00.694 --> 06:02.630
this year there will be
no Beverly Goldberg.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.132
I'm only here
'cause I promised
my dad I'd audition,

06:05.165 --> 06:06.667
so just throw me a few lines
and I'll be on my way.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.268
You got yourself a deal.

06:08.301 --> 06:09.737
ADULT ADAM:
And so I hatched my plan...

06:09.770 --> 06:11.071
...to half-ass my way
through Fiddler.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.743
Dude, I got Lazar Wolf,
the handsome town stud.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.678
That's typecasting
Dave Kim likes.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.012
I'm the constable.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.048
Six lines, no songs,
done by intermission.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.082
Dream role.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.619
Move.
Move your tiny bodies.

06:25.653 --> 06:26.854
Let's go.
Hey!

06:26.887 --> 06:28.656
Dad?
What are you doing here?

06:28.689 --> 06:30.023
Today's our big day!

06:30.057 --> 06:32.526
I wanted to see our name
at the top of the roster.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.727
It's more near the bottom,

06:33.761 --> 06:36.296
but it's still
a very meaty part,
the constable.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.566
What? We wanted Tevye
or nothing.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.501
Well...
Matt Schernecke got it.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.169
MURRAY:
That scrub is Tevye?

06:42.202 --> 06:44.337
He's got a warbly voice
and no stage presence.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.506
What's that?

06:45.539 --> 06:46.907
Mazel Tov, kid.
Way to go, Matt.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.476
Oh, okay.
Don't worry, champ.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.243
I'll get you that part
if it's the last thing I do.

06:50.277 --> 06:54.414
No! Matt Schernecke
is just a boy
with a kind spirit!

06:54.448 --> 06:55.683
You do not do anything
of the sort.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.050
I... You promise
to me, sir.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.953
95% of this game
is mental.

06:59.987 --> 07:03.223
We're gonna go
into Schernecke's head
and make him crack.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.592
You just learn
the lines.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.927
Me, I'll take care
of Schernecke.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.029
ADULT ADAM: That day,
my dad wasn't the only one

07:09.062 --> 07:10.197
with a card up his sleeve.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.133
"Torkulent"?
It means delighted
and a little scared.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.234
"Flimjam"?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.436
To run backwards
in a zig-zag pattern.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.606
Man, I didn't know
any of these SAT words.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.940
I'm so lucky I have you.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.742
You really are.
I'm a great person.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.976
No, she's not.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.678
Mom!
I'm sorry, Geoffrey.

07:24.712 --> 07:25.879
As a yenta,
I have to tell you,

07:25.913 --> 07:28.048
she is trying to keep you
from going to UCLA.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.449
Come on,
Erica would never do that.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.384
Who you gonna believe?
Your adoring girlfriend

07:31.418 --> 07:33.921
or this needy blond-helmeted
guilt monster?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.088
You, obviously.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.757
Our love is built on
an unbreakable trust

07:36.790 --> 07:37.858
that I cherish
more than...

07:37.891 --> 07:38.992
Damn it, it's me!

07:39.026 --> 07:40.227
I'm a terrible person,

07:40.260 --> 07:42.896
and you should just
flimjam away from me
as fast as you can.

07:42.930 --> 07:43.997
Oh, my God.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.466
My girlfriend would
actually tank my future

07:46.500 --> 07:48.536
just to be with me?

07:48.569 --> 07:50.971
You love me so much,
and I love you, too!

07:51.004 --> 07:52.105
Did not see that coming.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.707
Oh, man,
I'd give anything for you

07:53.741 --> 07:54.908
to come with me
to California!

07:54.942 --> 07:56.409
Wait, why can't I?

07:56.443 --> 07:58.345
LA is the center
of the music business.

07:58.378 --> 07:59.880
They have a building
that looks like records.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.915
Well, you can't come
with me because...

08:05.052 --> 08:06.286
Mom.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.755
You said you've changed,
right?

08:07.788 --> 08:09.489
Well, I have
said that recently, yes.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.792
Then this is it.
I'm asking
for your support on this,

08:11.825 --> 08:13.126
and if you really
have changed,

08:13.160 --> 08:14.494
then there's
no answer but yes.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.564
It's a yes.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.031
What?
Huh?

08:18.065 --> 08:19.466
What is that?
I'm lost.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.634
Yes.
Was that yes?

08:20.668 --> 08:21.802
Yes.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.370
I think I heard it
that time. She said yes!

08:23.403 --> 08:24.572
Ahh!

08:24.605 --> 08:26.006
See?
Yes, I have...

08:26.039 --> 08:27.307
I have changed.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.976
I have changed so, so much,
but, uh...

08:29.009 --> 08:30.443
Oh, Pops!

08:30.477 --> 08:31.612
He won't let you go.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.346
Go
What?

08:33.380 --> 08:35.749
I just came in
for an onion bialy.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.350
Erica wants
to move to LA.

08:37.384 --> 08:38.652
LA?

08:38.686 --> 08:40.988
Wow!
That's fantastic.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.023
Hollywood is
so magical.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.291
I'll for sure
visit you.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.793
No!
What?

08:45.826 --> 08:49.529
Uh, to be clear,
I have changed, and
I totally support you,

08:49.563 --> 08:52.600
but, uh, your dad
will not allow you

08:52.633 --> 08:54.201
to move to LA
without knowing a soul.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.804
Well, actually,
we have family there.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.405
Aunt Selma, remember?

08:58.438 --> 09:00.007
Wait,
I have relatives there?

09:00.040 --> 09:02.142
Yes, thank you, Dad.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.077
Her daughter Marci's
out there, too.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.813
She...
She's in advertising.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.547
Thank you, Father.
So helpful.

09:07.581 --> 09:10.217
She does all those catchy
commercial jingles.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.719
They pay very good money.

09:11.752 --> 09:12.820
So helpful, Dad.

09:12.853 --> 09:13.887
Holy crap!

09:13.921 --> 09:15.723
I don't just have family
in LA. I have an in!

09:15.756 --> 09:18.692
You should send her
a tape showing off
your beautiful voice,

09:18.726 --> 09:20.160
so she can hire you.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.395
What a great idea no one
asked you to suggest.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.164
I'm gonna go record
some jingles right now.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.565
I'm gonna go
familiarize myself

09:25.599 --> 09:27.067
with the Los Angeles
freeway system.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.172
ADULT ADAM:
Yep, my mom was cornered into
acting like a changed smother.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.874
Meanwhile, I was doing
whatever I could

09:33.907 --> 09:35.042
not to act in Fiddler.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.177
Channel the character.
You're Tevye.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.245
Take yourself there.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.247
And perform.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.986
I'm having
a hard time focusing.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.689
Balls! My dad's here
to rattle Schernecke's cage.
Huh?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.590
What?
You heard me.
This is bad.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.393
Mr. Goldberg,
if you're gonna
watch rehearsal,

09:53.426 --> 09:54.928
you have to respect
my stage.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.563
Sure. It's your team.
Manage it.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.731
All right.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.266
Take it from the top,
Matthew, all right?

09:59.299 --> 10:00.768
Be Tevye.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.937
Feel the burden
of the humble dairyman

10:03.971 --> 10:05.538
with five
handsome daughters.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.074
Bah!
Mr. Goldberg!

10:07.107 --> 10:09.643
I'm sorry.
I don't buy this kid
having five daughters.

10:09.677 --> 10:10.744
Do you?

10:10.778 --> 10:12.245
Yes.
I buy it...enough.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.914
C'mon, the kid's
a tomato can.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.049
Can't hit the broad side
of his mark.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.284
This adult man
is hurting my feelings.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.919
MURRAY:
Sack up, Schernecke.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.221
You gotta have thick skin
if you want to make it
in the big show.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.956
Adam, is your dad
gonna be here
the whole time?

10:22.990 --> 10:24.792
I don't know, man.
He took the week off work.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.660
The whole thing's been
off the rails from the start.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.662
I just want my kid to have
a shot at the bigs.

10:28.696 --> 10:29.930
Fine.
If you pipe down,

10:29.963 --> 10:31.231
I'll make him
the understudy
for Tevye.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.565
Does that work
for you?

10:32.599 --> 10:34.902
So, that means
I'll have no lines

10:34.935 --> 10:36.236
and get to just hang
in the wings?

10:36.269 --> 10:37.671
'Cause, yeah,
that super works.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.606
Whoo!
It's on now!

10:39.639 --> 10:41.875
You better watch your back,
fake Tevye.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.443
'Cause we're comin'
for ya.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.979
Dad, stop making
veiled threats
to Matt Schernecke.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.514
They're kind of
not veiled at all.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.082
I'm so sorry.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.452
ADULT ADAM:
With her sights set on LA,

10:52.485 --> 10:54.654
my sister prepped
an epic audition

10:54.688 --> 10:56.056
to get into
the jingle business.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.926
Hello and welcome,
product lovers of all ages.

10:58.959 --> 11:02.295
Prepare to be delighted
by my delightful
jingle medley.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.432
I'm already delighted,
but I'm prepared for more.

11:05.465 --> 11:09.903
* The best part of waking up
is Folgers in your... *

11:09.937 --> 11:12.639
* Plop-plop, fizz-fizz
oh, what a relief... *

11:12.672 --> 11:14.942
* Honeycomb's big
yeah, yeah, yeah *

11:14.975 --> 11:17.644
* Gimme a break
gimme a break... *

11:17.677 --> 11:19.780
* What would you
do-oo-ooh for... *

11:19.813 --> 11:21.849
* An Oscar Mayer wiener... *

11:21.882 --> 11:23.250
* By Mennen! *

11:23.283 --> 11:26.553
* Mommy, wow
I'm a big kid... *

11:26.586 --> 11:29.022
* Meow, meow, meow, meow
meow, meow, meow, meow

11:29.056 --> 11:31.024
* Meow, meow, meow, meow
meow, meow, meow, meow *

11:31.058 --> 11:32.459
Wow!

11:32.492 --> 11:35.562
I don't know
what half of those
are selling, but I'm buying.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.663
Mom, what do you think?

11:36.696 --> 11:37.731
Please, no!

11:37.765 --> 11:39.099
What?
Ugh...

11:39.132 --> 11:42.269
Got some bad news
from cousin Marci last night.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.837
Just out of the blue
like that?

11:43.871 --> 11:46.006
You haven't talked
in 15 years.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.675
Yeah, well,
I've been missing her.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.277
And it's a good thing
I called, too,

11:50.310 --> 11:54.281
because she told me that
for legal reasons,

11:54.314 --> 11:56.817
she can't listen to jingles
from existing products.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.685
But I worked so hard
on these.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.820
I was gonna mail her
a tape.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.289
No! No, you can't.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.558
It has to do with,
uh, torts and briefs
and subpoenas.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.061
I could've been a lawyer,
so it made sense to me.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.529
Well, how am I
gonna impress her
with my jingle voice

12:09.562 --> 12:11.331
if I can't do
any jingles?

12:11.364 --> 12:12.866
Good news...

12:12.900 --> 12:16.603
She told me
about some, uh,

12:16.636 --> 12:19.072
new products that have yet
to be jingled.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.141
Name it, and I'll sing it.
Hit me.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.976
ADULT ADAM: Even though
my mom swore she changed,

12:23.010 --> 12:25.345
in the end,
she couldn't help but lie.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.614
Dr. Steinman's...
Butt Grease.

12:27.647 --> 12:30.017
I'm very curious
about this product.

12:30.050 --> 12:34.087
Dr. Steinman's
a very respected
tushie surgeon.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.623
He developed
the healing ointment himself,

12:36.656 --> 12:38.391
and now he's sharing it
with the world.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.527
Steinman...
I got to sing that?

12:40.560 --> 12:41.929
It's not so easy
on the ear.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.096
It's not great.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.433
But yet, the next one
is even worse.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.169
Barnaby's Baltic Sea Juice.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.337
I don't want
that product.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.972
There's more.

12:52.005 --> 12:55.242
Magellan's Ol' Fashioned
Year Round 'Nog

12:55.275 --> 12:58.045
for people who want eggnog,
but not just at Christmas.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.980
I'd like a good 'nog
in the summer.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.882
Well, if it's up to me,
you're gonna get one.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.583
And I know you
can do it, Schmoo.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.552
And if not, you can
just live here forever.

13:05.585 --> 13:06.887
We'll play it by ear.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.588
Thanks for always being there
for me, Mom.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.656
You're awesome.

13:09.689 --> 13:10.958
Time to get jingling.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.827
Okay, Adam, time to run
that choreography,

13:13.861 --> 13:15.195
so give me
the shimmy.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.529
ADULT ADAM:
I was back at rehearsal,

13:16.563 --> 13:18.565
but unfortunately,
so was my dad.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.367
Is that all you got, AG?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.903
Put your bat on the ball.
Let the big dog eat!

13:22.936 --> 13:24.838
ADULT ADAM:
When Matt's dad heard
I got the understudy,

13:24.872 --> 13:26.639
he came to check
out the competition.

13:26.673 --> 13:29.009
Come on there, Matty boy.
Just how we practiced.

13:29.042 --> 13:32.445
ADULT ADAM:
Turns out the only thing worse
than one sports dad is two.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.546
First, they cheered.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.015
Come on, AG!
Come on, now!
Let's go.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.316
Go big or go home,
Matty boy.
Look alive!

13:36.349 --> 13:37.684
ADULT ADAM:
Then, they bragged.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.452
My son is
a five-tool player.

13:39.486 --> 13:43.390
He sings, dances, acts,
juggles, and mimes.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.491
ADULT ADAM:
Next came the insults.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.993
Give it a rest,
Schernecke.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.560
Your kid's no Tevye.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.297
That wheelbarrow's
got more charisma.
What did you say?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.831
ADULT ADAM:
And then the head games.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.766
Afraid we're gonna take
your spot in the rotation?

13:53.800 --> 13:55.168
'Cause you should be.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.436
Oh, please.

13:56.469 --> 14:00.173
Your son deedle dye-dles
when he should be
dye-dle deedle-ing!

14:00.207 --> 14:02.309
ADULT ADAM: And finally,
the gloves came off.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.944
Stop kicking it on me
first!

14:03.977 --> 14:05.445
Our dads suck.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.613
They really do.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.248
ADULT ADAM:
As our sports dads
ruined theater,

14:08.281 --> 14:10.483
Erica was rehearsing songs
for fake products

14:10.517 --> 14:11.885
my mom lied to her about.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.988
* It's for your bottom
but it's the tops

14:15.022 --> 14:17.991
* Find happiness
in just a glop

14:18.025 --> 14:20.793
* From Dr. Steinman
to every shop

14:20.827 --> 14:23.330
* The one butt grease
that never stops *

14:25.732 --> 14:28.135
Wow. That is
shockingly good.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.602
It's already stuck in my head
and driving me nuts.

14:29.636 --> 14:30.670
You're a genius.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.105
And that's not all!

14:33.206 --> 14:35.909
* Pour it cold
or drink it warm

14:35.943 --> 14:38.645
* It's like seafood
in liquid form

14:38.678 --> 14:42.082
* It's Barnaby's
the juice of the sea *

14:42.115 --> 14:44.817
Wow. You really
worked hard on these.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.086
Okay, there's gonna be lines
out the door

14:46.119 --> 14:47.687
to drink
that salty fish juice.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.822
And this next one
is dedicated to you.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.324
Oh,
that's not necessary.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.459
No, it is.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.295
You talked to Marci and made
all this happen for me.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.330
You have changed,
and I love you.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.865
Just focus on the song.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.501
* You gotta remember
'nog ain't just for December

15:01.534 --> 15:04.071
* You can 'nog
all summer afternoon... *

15:04.104 --> 15:06.006
It's all a lie!
What?

15:06.039 --> 15:07.740
None of these products
are real,

15:07.774 --> 15:10.410
and frankly, I don't get
how you thought they were.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.246
'Cause you swore it was real
and that you changed!

15:13.280 --> 15:16.049
Okay, I'm sorry I freaked out
about you moving,

15:16.083 --> 15:19.286
but good thing is, I stopped
before any damage was done.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.820
But there was damage!

15:20.853 --> 15:22.522
So much damage!

15:22.555 --> 15:25.658
I sent these insane
jingles to Marci.
Wazzat?

15:25.692 --> 15:27.427
I sent her a cassette!

15:27.460 --> 15:29.062
She's gonna think
I'm some crazy person

15:29.096 --> 15:31.898
who peddles weird oyster water
and all-purpose 'nog.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.433
There is no going back
from this.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.968
Okay, Mama will fix it.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.237
I'll call Marci
and explain everything.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.773
Sure, explain how it's my SATs
all over again, but worse.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.242
Don't say that.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.776
It's true.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.379
For the first time
since dropping out of college,

15:46.413 --> 15:47.747
I had hope.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.982
Thanks a lot.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.390
ADULT ADAM:
My sports dad embarrassed me
in the theater world,

15:57.424 --> 15:59.259
and I was ready
to close the curtain.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.062
Stupid heavy jacket
from the old country!

16:02.095 --> 16:03.596
Whoa.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.897
Everything okay, man?

16:04.931 --> 16:07.800
No, Ruben Amaro Jr.,
everything's not okay.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.336
What happened, bro?

16:09.369 --> 16:11.471
You break up with that girl
who dated me freshman year?

16:11.504 --> 16:13.973
No, and I'd prefer
we not discuss that.

16:14.007 --> 16:17.110
It's my dad. He insists
on coming to every
single practice.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.312
I hear ya. My dad comes
to every practice, too.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.281
So you get
how much it sucks.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.250
No.
My dad's my best friend.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.751
I'm almost done,
champ!

16:24.784 --> 16:26.253
Let's warm up that arm
before practice.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.654
Be there
in a minute, Pop.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.822
Just talking to my
ex-girlfriend's
little boyfriend here.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.624
I love how you're always there
for everyone.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.925
You taught me well,
Dad.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.027
I love you, son.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.328
I love you more!

16:35.362 --> 16:38.331
Wow. This is just like
the total opposite
of my experience.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.432
What can I say?

16:39.466 --> 16:41.134
Ruben Sr. was
an athlete himself,

16:41.168 --> 16:42.835
so he knows how crazy
sports dads can get.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.037
I re-gripped your bat,
buddy.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.005
Super thoughtful,
Dad!

16:46.039 --> 16:48.308
Yeah, last thing he wants is
for me to get burnt out

16:48.341 --> 16:50.643
so I fake an injury
or quit altogether.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.012
You're right!
I can totally fake an injury!

16:53.046 --> 16:55.148
I'll pretend I lost my voice
so I can't sing.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.516
Wait, what sport
do you play?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.651
The greatest sport
of all, theater.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.188
Yeah, I kinda wish I knew that
before I got involved.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.156
There you are, AG.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.625
Come on, you got the call.
You're goin' in.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.595
Bad news.
Lost my voice.
Whatcha gonna do?

17:08.628 --> 17:10.863
Hydrate it.
Suck on a lozenge.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.199
Get back out there!

17:12.232 --> 17:13.633
Ruben, get away
from that demanding father.

17:13.666 --> 17:14.701
He'll kill your spirit.

17:14.734 --> 17:15.802
On it, Pop.

17:15.835 --> 17:16.969
Who the hell's that?

17:17.003 --> 17:18.771
That is the wonderful father
of Ruben Amaro Jr.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.708
named Ruben Amaro Sr.,
and I wish that was us.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.843
That is us!
I'm here.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.378
I'm trying to help you,
you moron!

17:25.412 --> 17:26.479
Well, you're not!

17:26.513 --> 17:29.249
I hate this play,
and now I hate all musicals.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.485
So thank you for taking
my favorite thing in the world

17:32.519 --> 17:33.953
and ruining it.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.022
(MIKE + THE MECHANICS
PLAYING THE LIVING YEARS)

17:37.890 --> 17:39.426
Schmoo?

17:39.459 --> 17:41.428
Save your schmoos.
I don't want to
hear it from you.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.396
I just got off the phone
with cousin Marci.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.964
Oh, God, well,
what did you do now?

17:44.997 --> 17:46.032
Nothing.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.801
Apparently, Marci played
your jingles for her office,

17:48.835 --> 17:51.104
and they loved 'em.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.439
Thought it was
a bold stunt.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.773
Stunt?

17:53.806 --> 17:56.576
You gave me those songs
to make me look like
a crazy person.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.211
Well, they don't need
to know that.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.713
That's great, but it doesn't
make up for the fact

18:00.747 --> 18:04.050
that you sabotaged me
and you're never gonna change.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.352
I know.

18:05.385 --> 18:08.421
Truth is, I am a selfish,
scheming mama bear

18:08.455 --> 18:09.889
who can't
let her kids leave

18:09.922 --> 18:12.559
because she loves them
so damn much.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.294
And the worst thing is,

18:14.327 --> 18:17.730
I'll be like this
'til I'm 75 years old.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.767
If that's your way of saying
I'm sorry, it's not working.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.035
I knew you were
gonna say that.

18:24.271 --> 18:27.474
So I thought maybe some
new flash cards might help.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.409
* Say it loud

18:29.442 --> 18:30.577
Don't.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.379
* Say it loud

18:32.412 --> 18:33.446
* Say it clear

18:33.480 --> 18:34.881
Really not helping.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.449
* Whoa-oh, say it clear *

18:36.483 --> 18:37.750
God.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.852
* You can listen

18:39.886 --> 18:40.920
Still a no.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.956
* As well as you hear

18:43.990 --> 18:45.292
"Rapplepop," really?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.962
* It's too late

18:49.996 --> 18:51.598
* It's too late

18:51.631 --> 18:53.065
Even if I'm
in Los Angeles?

18:53.099 --> 18:54.567
* When we die

18:54.601 --> 18:56.869
* Whoa-oh, when we die

18:56.903 --> 18:58.905
* To admit

18:58.938 --> 19:01.808
* We don't see eye to eye...

19:01.841 --> 19:03.876
How did you know
I was gonna ask that?

19:03.910 --> 19:06.613
'Cause I know you
better than anyone, schmoo.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.916
And the one thing about me
that'll never change

19:09.949 --> 19:12.285
is how much
I rapplepop you.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.120
* Between the present
and the past

19:14.153 --> 19:16.656
I rapplepop you too, Mom.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.659
* We only sacrifice
the future

19:22.028 --> 19:25.131
* It's the bitterness
that lasts...

19:25.164 --> 19:26.799
Whatcha doing?

19:26.833 --> 19:29.068
Thinking about joining
the baseball team.

19:29.101 --> 19:32.339
All the dads there seem to be
very kind and supportive.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.706
I deserve that.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.107
If you're just gonna
yell at me again...

19:35.141 --> 19:36.709
I'm really not.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.246
All I want is for you
to follow me.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.780
ADULT ADAM:
And for the first time ever,

19:40.813 --> 19:44.451
my dad was the one who shared
a home movie with me.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.986
* Say it, say it
say it loud...

19:47.019 --> 19:49.356
Okay,
what am I looking at?

19:49.389 --> 19:50.457
Me.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.459
You were in Fiddler?

19:52.492 --> 19:54.193
I played Tevye.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.996
I only auditioned
because my dad loved the play.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.266
But Pop-Pop
hates everything.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.800
Not this.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.502
He was so proud.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.804
He would sit
in the front row
every night.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.639
And for the first time,

20:06.673 --> 20:08.741
I felt close to the guy,
you know?

20:10.009 --> 20:12.712
So, that's why
this means so much to you?

20:12.745 --> 20:14.314
I know it's stupid.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.884
But I just wanted us
to have the same thing
I had with my dad.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.320
ADULT ADAM:
In that moment,
I realized why my father

20:20.353 --> 20:23.155
became a crazed sports dad
when it came to Fiddler.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.057
He wasn't trying to live
through me.

20:25.091 --> 20:28.495
He was trying to connect
the only way he knew how.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.363
And with a little perspective,

20:30.397 --> 20:34.066
I finally understood just
how great of a play it was.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.902
Sometimes,
it's hard to understand

20:35.935 --> 20:38.571
why the people we love
act the way they do.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.507
But when you put
your trust in them,

20:40.540 --> 20:43.209
that's when the real
traditions come to life.

20:43.242 --> 20:48.281
* Hey, so say it, say it
say it loud... *

21:01.428 --> 21:03.963
Okay, everyone
shut your faces.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.765
Dad, I've decided
who I'm gonna

21:05.798 --> 21:07.066
be in Fiddler on the Roof,

21:07.099 --> 21:08.335
so you can finally be

21:08.368 --> 21:09.402
my sports theater Dad.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.770
His sports what?
Don't ask.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.238
I shall be Lazer Wolf.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.540
Stop! The play's over!

21:13.573 --> 21:14.974
Ah.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.709
You're trying to motivate me.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.245
Well, Lazer Wolf never quits
'cause he's got lasers!

21:19.278 --> 21:22.615
Moron! Lazar Wolf is
the respected town butcher.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.454
I don't know what any
of that was.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.488
It's for the best.
