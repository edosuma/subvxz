WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.655
Okay, Mommy's gonna go to work,

00:03.699 --> 00:06.484
so you stay here
and be a good boy.

00:06.528 --> 00:09.052
[gibberish]
...treats.

00:10.488 --> 00:12.012
Okay.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.506
[gibberish]

00:35.426 --> 00:37.994
[gibberish]

00:41.693 --> 00:43.608
[exhales]
Oh.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.349
What a lovely creature.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.395
[gibberish]

00:53.401 --> 00:56.404
Okay, Mommy's got bacon.

00:59.450 --> 01:00.843
Uh-oh.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.238
Hey.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.022
Peter, have you seen my dog?

01:06.066 --> 01:08.329
Yes, a beautiful sheepdog

01:08.372 --> 01:11.071
reminiscent of Nana
from Peter Pan?

01:11.114 --> 01:12.637
That's him.[chuckles] Did you know

01:12.681 --> 01:15.640
that Peter Pan has
been a play, a book,

01:15.684 --> 01:17.599
a musical and a film?

01:17.642 --> 01:20.297
Where'd he go?Not a clue.

01:20.341 --> 01:22.691
And peanut butter!

01:27.957 --> 01:30.481
Well, hello there.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.701
[chuckles]:
Oh. Come on up.

01:32.744 --> 01:35.269
Oh, look at you.

01:35.312 --> 01:37.314
[gibberish]

02:29.540 --> 02:30.541
What about him?

02:30.585 --> 02:31.760
What do you think of him?

02:31.803 --> 02:33.414
I don't think of him at all.

02:33.457 --> 02:36.156
I'm pretty sure
he's sweet on you.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.461
[laughs softly]
Take a number.

02:39.071 --> 02:41.204
I'm just saying, if you can
disregard his politics,

02:41.248 --> 02:42.466
he's a decent guy.

02:42.510 --> 02:43.728
Maybe.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.469
Do you think he has
to take a pill?

02:45.513 --> 02:47.689
They all have to take a pill.

02:48.516 --> 02:49.691
And right on cue.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.606
May I join you, ladies?

02:51.649 --> 02:52.911
Sure.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.132
What you got there?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.655
Who the hell knows?

02:57.699 --> 02:59.440
I got to take a pill
for everything.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.968
Here you go.
I brought you some-some n...

03:07.361 --> 03:08.623
What is that?

03:08.666 --> 03:10.451
I made a friend.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.366
Well, where'd he come from?

03:12.409 --> 03:15.456
I don't know, I don't care,
but I'm keeping him.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.458
Ah. Look at this. Uh.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.155
Oh.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.939
"Hello, my name is Cannoli."

03:20.983 --> 03:23.855
[chuckles]Who names a dog Cannoli?

03:25.161 --> 03:26.684
So what are you gals
up to today?

03:26.728 --> 03:27.772
Not much.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.383
We were talking about going over

03:29.426 --> 03:31.907
to the Naval base,
picking up some sailors.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.518
Sailors, really?

03:34.562 --> 03:37.521
You know what a Marine
says to a sailor?

03:37.565 --> 03:39.001
"Thanks for the ride."

03:40.002 --> 03:41.525
I take it you were a Marine?

03:41.569 --> 03:43.135
Semper fi, baby.

03:43.179 --> 03:46.182
Look at that, I've progressed
from a gal to a baby.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.532
I'm sorry. Did I offend you?

03:48.576 --> 03:51.535
Not at all. I enjoy
our little badinage.

03:51.579 --> 03:54.625
Badinage?
Is that like tying people up?

03:54.669 --> 03:56.105
'Cause I'm game.

03:58.890 --> 04:01.110
Are you still high
from last night?

04:01.153 --> 04:03.068
It's hard to tell.

04:03.112 --> 04:06.550
When you're always high,
is high still high?

04:06.594 --> 04:08.987
Whoa.

04:09.031 --> 04:11.860
Hey, have you guys seen
Cannoli wandering around?

04:11.903 --> 04:13.601
You brought Cannoli?

04:13.644 --> 04:14.776
Oh, I love him.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.125
Where'd you see him last?

04:16.168 --> 04:17.126
In my office.

04:17.169 --> 04:18.693
Did you look there?

04:18.736 --> 04:21.739
Yes, I did.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.611
Well, either way,
you smell great.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.961
What?

04:26.004 --> 04:27.136
[phone ringing]

04:27.179 --> 04:28.746
Hello?

04:28.790 --> 04:30.661
Yeah, I think I got your dog.

04:30.705 --> 04:31.923
Oh, thank God. Who is this?

04:31.967 --> 04:33.185
Who is this?

04:33.229 --> 04:35.579
And a thank-you would be nice.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.625
Harry, is that you?

04:37.668 --> 04:39.322
Maybe.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.629
And I'm still waiting
for that thank-you.

04:41.672 --> 04:43.674
I think I found him.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.110
Still waiting.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.547
You do smell nice.

04:46.590 --> 04:47.765
Oh, thank you.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.289
Was that so hard?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.683
[knocking on door]

04:52.727 --> 04:53.684
Come in.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.339
Ugh, I am so sorry.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.862
Oh...Not a problem.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.473
He's wonderful.Yeah, yes.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.170
E-Except for the stupid name.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.303
Why is it stupid?

05:03.346 --> 05:05.870
Well, you lose a dog,
you run out to the street

05:05.914 --> 05:07.002
yelling "Cannoli,"

05:07.045 --> 05:08.046
people are gonna come around

05:08.090 --> 05:09.613
looking for dessert.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.355
Okay, I'll get him
out of your hair.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.357
He's always welcome here.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.227
Come on, Cannoli.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.273
Cannoli, come.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.796
[sighs]Okay.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.407
You're being a bad boy,

05:20.450 --> 05:21.451
and bad boys

05:21.495 --> 05:22.626
[gibberish]
...treats.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.848
Hey, do you still
need the van

05:26.891 --> 05:28.415
for your doctor's appointment?

05:28.458 --> 05:30.417
Oh, yes, we do.All right, I'll take care of it.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.549
That dog needs a saddle.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.813
I am very disappointed in you.

05:35.857 --> 05:39.339
You have to listen
to me, mister.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.688
When I tell you
to stay in my office,

05:40.731 --> 05:41.776
I don't mean go gallivanting...

05:42.820 --> 05:43.952
Cannoli?

05:43.995 --> 05:45.867
With a cup of coffee?
That'd be nice.

05:49.044 --> 05:51.002
[sighs]
You're the one who said

05:51.046 --> 05:52.961
you wanted to come
into work with me.

05:53.004 --> 05:55.616
But if you keep wandering off,
then you're going

05:55.659 --> 05:56.878
straight back to doggy day care

05:56.921 --> 05:59.228
with all those doodles
who don't like you.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.361
[car horn honking]

06:05.800 --> 06:06.757
Drew?

06:06.801 --> 06:08.063
[exhales]

06:11.327 --> 06:12.372
Stay.

06:14.504 --> 06:17.202
Mommy loves you.

06:17.246 --> 06:18.639
[door closes]

06:18.682 --> 06:21.598
Hey. What's going on?

06:21.642 --> 06:25.167
Not much.
Just showing off my new house.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.430
[chuckles]What?

06:27.474 --> 06:28.997
What happened
to your actual house?

06:29.040 --> 06:33.567
I sold it. For one that gets
nine miles to the gallon.

06:34.568 --> 06:35.830
Oh, Drew.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.222
It's gonna be great.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.746
I'm gonna hit
the open road,

06:38.789 --> 06:40.704
see the country,
sleep in parking lots.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.053
#VanLife!

06:42.097 --> 06:43.707
[both chuckle]

06:43.751 --> 06:46.188
Oh, Drew.

06:46.231 --> 06:48.669
I know it seems impulsive,
but that's how I roll now.

06:48.712 --> 06:50.888
You know? Life in the fast lane.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.890
Well, not fast,
but certainly keeping up

06:52.934 --> 06:54.239
with the flow of traffic.

06:54.283 --> 06:57.112
Oh, Drew.Yeah.

06:57.155 --> 07:00.071
First stop, the Grand Tetons.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.333
Oh, wait.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.031
Are you going mountain climbing?

07:03.074 --> 07:05.076
Oh, heavens, no.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.384
I'm just gonna park at a lookout
point and, you know, look.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.386
#VanLife!

07:10.430 --> 07:12.649
Oh, Drew.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.782
What's this doing here?

07:14.825 --> 07:16.653
It's Drew's new house.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.568
Oh, Drew.

07:19.569 --> 07:20.875
[knocking on door]

07:20.918 --> 07:23.921
Gina, we have a serious problem.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.664
Well, I tried.

07:33.801 --> 07:36.717
I saw a fantastic movie
last night.Yeah,

07:36.760 --> 07:38.936
and I heard the whole damn thing
through the wall.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.503
You don't want to start with me.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.809
Oh, yeah, I do.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.854
What was the movie?

07:43.898 --> 07:45.900
It was called, uh...

07:45.943 --> 07:47.249
Oh, wait, I-I just had it.

07:47.292 --> 07:48.903
It's right on the tip
of my tongue. Um...

07:48.946 --> 07:50.470
it was-it was, um...

07:50.513 --> 07:51.949
It starred that handsome fellow.

07:51.993 --> 07:54.517
Uh, British, he was in
the Civil War movie

07:54.561 --> 07:56.040
with what's-her-name, uh...

07:56.084 --> 07:57.346
F. Murray Abraham.

07:57.389 --> 07:58.869
He's not British.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.829
He's not? He should be.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.265
And how is he handsome?

08:04.527 --> 08:06.224
His talent makes him handsome.

08:07.835 --> 08:10.925
You mind if I change
the subject?Please.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.754
Me and Bette are going out
to dinner tonight.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.059
You're welcome.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.017
For what?

08:16.060 --> 08:17.932
Never mind. Go on.

08:17.975 --> 08:20.195
Well, it's been a while
since I dated.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.806
H-Have the rules changed much?

08:22.850 --> 08:24.460
You mean since you were young?

08:24.504 --> 08:28.812
Well, you no longer have
to bring her father a goat.

08:28.856 --> 08:29.770
[Peter laughs]

08:29.813 --> 08:31.685
I get it.

08:31.728 --> 08:34.339
'Cause he's old.

08:34.383 --> 08:37.081
W-What about opening the door
for a broad?

08:37.125 --> 08:39.823
D-Do they still like that,
or is that "offensive"?

08:39.867 --> 08:41.346
Uh, openinga door,

08:41.390 --> 08:44.741
good, but only Sinatra
can call a woman a broad.

08:44.785 --> 08:47.004
And you ain't no Sinatra.

08:48.484 --> 08:49.529
It's a whole new world
out there.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.095
You got to treat her
like an equal.

08:51.139 --> 08:54.316
Unless she knows kung fu,
she's not my equal.

08:54.359 --> 08:57.972
Just be a gentleman
and talk as little as possible.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.800
And maybe bring some flowers.

08:59.843 --> 09:02.106
Perhaps memorize a poem
that expresses

09:02.150 --> 09:04.195
how she makes you feel.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.936
A poem?Yes.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.982
Like a fairy?Oh, no.

09:08.025 --> 09:08.896
Spencer.What?

09:08.939 --> 09:10.724
That's offensive?

09:10.767 --> 09:11.986
Fairies are nice.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.119
Daniel Day-Lewis!

09:16.947 --> 09:18.383
Got it.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.951
Okay, honest opinion.

09:20.995 --> 09:24.868
Do you prefer the roast beef
or the pork loin?

09:27.958 --> 09:29.917
How do you keep getting out?

09:29.960 --> 09:32.876
Hang on. He's helping
me with the menu.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.835
[crunching, slobbering]

09:34.878 --> 09:39.753
Okay, I'm surprised,
but pork loin it is.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.363
That is how you decide?

09:41.406 --> 09:42.625
He will eat anything.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.019
No, no, he spit up the halibut.

09:45.062 --> 09:48.065
Broke my heart,
but pushing me to be better.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.893
Come on, buddy.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.984
Um, what are you doing?

09:54.028 --> 09:54.985
You said "come on."

09:55.029 --> 09:56.421
To him.

09:57.553 --> 09:58.685
You guys see that?

09:58.728 --> 09:59.816
She said "buddy,"

09:59.860 --> 10:01.470
and I thought it was me.

10:04.342 --> 10:05.822
HARRY:You know, this
isn't just

10:05.866 --> 10:06.954
a decision for you.

10:06.997 --> 10:08.346
I think it is.

10:08.390 --> 10:09.609
Really?

10:09.652 --> 10:11.741
After 55 years,
I'm not a part of this?

10:11.785 --> 10:13.047
[knocking on door]Go away.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.136
Come on in.

10:16.006 --> 10:18.095
Nothing I say matters.

10:19.096 --> 10:20.358
Excuse me.

10:20.402 --> 10:22.360
Oh, okay.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.145
There's a make-your-own
sundae bar in the day room,

10:24.188 --> 10:25.712
but you don't care. Bye.

10:27.061 --> 10:28.279
Oh, Cannoli.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.150
Come.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.586
No, leave him.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.935
I-I like it.

10:31.979 --> 10:35.069
Hey, is everything okay
with Harry?

10:35.112 --> 10:36.331
Don't worry about it.

10:36.374 --> 10:37.898
How'd it go at the doctor?

10:39.073 --> 10:42.250
He wanted me to start
another round of chemo.

10:42.293 --> 10:43.730
I said no.

10:43.773 --> 10:46.297
[exhales]

10:46.341 --> 10:47.603
Meredith.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.085
Why not?

10:51.128 --> 10:53.522
What's it gonna get me?

10:53.565 --> 10:55.045
Couple of months?

10:55.089 --> 10:57.004
Maybe more. You never know.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.527
I know.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.485
Every day
there's new treatments and...

11:00.529 --> 11:02.792
Gina, I'm done with all of this.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.925
I just...

11:04.968 --> 11:08.363
I just want to enjoy the time
that I have left.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.106
And I take it
Harry doesn't agree.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.545
He wants me to fight.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.201
I got no fight left.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.074
I understand.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.208
No, you don't.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.691
But thank you.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.219
I'll let you rest.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.834
Cannoli, come.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.749
Come, Cannoli.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.447
[sighs]
Squirrel!

11:49.491 --> 11:51.580
Leave him. He's fine.

11:51.623 --> 11:52.624
Are you sure?

11:52.668 --> 11:55.323
He makes me feel good.

11:56.454 --> 11:59.022
That I understand.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.162
I don't care
what she told the doctor.

12:08.205 --> 12:09.772
We'll be there
tomorrow

12:09.816 --> 12:10.991
for her treatment.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.993
Uh... Why put me on hold?

12:13.036 --> 12:14.516
Just write it down.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.824
No, you don't have
to check with the doctor.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.129
And I'm on hold.

12:21.610 --> 12:22.916
What are you looking at?

12:22.959 --> 12:24.221
You do know
you're not the only one

12:24.265 --> 12:25.527
in this room?

12:26.571 --> 12:28.138
Don't poke the bear.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.097
I'm not afraid of him.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.185
I am.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.665
HARRY:
Let me make this

12:33.709 --> 12:35.058
crystal clear.

12:35.102 --> 12:38.758
My wife is not stopping
her chemo, capisce?

12:38.801 --> 12:41.586
I really don't think
we should be hearing this.

12:41.630 --> 12:44.415
If you live in this place long
enough, you hear everything.

12:44.459 --> 12:47.114
Did you know that Spencer
had two polyps removed

12:47.157 --> 12:49.333
during his colonoscopy?

12:49.377 --> 12:50.639
Were they benign?

12:50.682 --> 12:54.382
One was, one was worrisome.

12:54.425 --> 12:56.253
You mind? I'm on the phone.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.125
Do you mind kissing my derriere?

13:02.216 --> 13:04.044
Where are you taking her?

13:04.087 --> 13:06.002
Red Lobster.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.308
You think I need a tie?

13:07.351 --> 13:10.267
Or is that just gonna get
in my melted butter?

13:10.311 --> 13:13.053
You look fine.You sure?

13:13.096 --> 13:15.011
She has cataracts.
I wouldn't worry about it.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.273
GIDEON:
Greetings.

13:16.317 --> 13:19.189
I bring word
from the beautiful Bette.

13:19.233 --> 13:20.800
The lady needs
a little more time to prepare.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.237
Are you kidding me?
We have a reservation.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.806
You can't just move those around
during Lobsterfest.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.243
Worst-case, you take her
somewhere else.

13:29.286 --> 13:33.421
Good point. There's a Marie
Callender in the same mini-mall.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.989
You are a high-class guy.

13:36.032 --> 13:37.773
Thanks, man.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.124
Hey, have you guys seen Harry?

13:41.168 --> 13:42.299
He's in the game room.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.953
And he's a dick.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.872
[groans softly]

13:50.917 --> 13:53.702
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

13:53.745 --> 13:56.139
No.You know I'm gonna.

13:56.183 --> 13:58.272
[groans]

13:58.315 --> 13:59.969
So, I was talking to Meredith.

14:00.013 --> 14:00.927
[clears throat]

14:00.970 --> 14:02.145
And I really believe

14:02.189 --> 14:04.104
this is her decision to make.

14:04.147 --> 14:05.409
Believe what you want.

14:05.453 --> 14:06.584
And for what it's worth,

14:06.628 --> 14:08.151
she's not thinking straight.

14:08.195 --> 14:10.066
Are you sure about that?

14:10.110 --> 14:13.374
What good is a little extra
time if she's suffering?

14:13.417 --> 14:17.204
She's just tired.
She'll change her mind.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.641
Harry?Hmm?

14:19.684 --> 14:21.208
Do you believe in God?

14:22.339 --> 14:23.775
What kind of question is that?

14:23.819 --> 14:25.560
Course I do.Then...

14:26.604 --> 14:28.432
...put this in His hands.

14:33.176 --> 14:36.223
You know,
when our daughter died...

14:37.833 --> 14:40.967
...I wouldn't have made it
without Meredith.

14:41.010 --> 14:44.231
So, if she goes...

14:44.274 --> 14:46.276
then...

14:46.320 --> 14:49.366
what's the point
of anything? I...

14:49.410 --> 14:53.631
You've helped her
through so much.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.938
Please don't stop now.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.333
[clears throat]

14:59.376 --> 15:00.464
I'm done talking.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.166
[sighs]

15:09.125 --> 15:11.562
How is this supposed
to help my arthritis?

15:11.606 --> 15:14.739
Oh, did I say your arthritis?
I meant myarthritis.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.440
Yikes.

15:20.441 --> 15:21.921
Thank you.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.183
No.

15:23.226 --> 15:24.967
I mean, is that maybe

15:25.011 --> 15:26.316
a little much?

15:26.360 --> 15:28.275
Or not enough?

15:28.318 --> 15:29.580
What are you saying?

15:29.624 --> 15:32.322
I'm saying you're
a natural hottie, you don't

15:32.366 --> 15:33.323
need to do all that.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.282
Oh, Spencer.

15:35.325 --> 15:36.892
You don't like
the way I look?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.241
No. Yeah. I-I...

15:38.285 --> 15:40.113
M-Maybe it's too festive

15:40.156 --> 15:41.897
for the Red Lobster.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.812
Great, then you can go alone.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.379
Norma, help me.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.424
What'd I say about talking?

15:47.468 --> 15:48.338
BETTE:
As you lie alone

15:48.382 --> 15:50.558
in bed tonight, consider this:

15:50.601 --> 15:53.387
I'm not wearing any panties.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.869
I like lobster.

16:11.361 --> 16:12.884
[sighs]

16:12.928 --> 16:14.321
Oh, Drew.

16:16.279 --> 16:17.324
It's open.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.023
Hi.Hey.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.242
Did you see I named the van?

16:22.285 --> 16:23.895
Yeah.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.071
Yeah, that's
what we do,

16:25.114 --> 16:26.376
us nomads.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.857
Nomads?

16:28.900 --> 16:31.251
Come on in.Okay.

16:31.294 --> 16:34.254
Uh, can I get you anything?
Cold drink? Hot drink?

16:34.297 --> 16:35.603
Uh, I'm okay.I could roast a chicken.

16:35.646 --> 16:38.432
I don't have any chicken,
but if I did, I could.

16:38.475 --> 16:39.607
Oh, maybe next time.

16:39.650 --> 16:40.869
Okay.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.175
So, uh...

16:43.698 --> 16:45.134
what brings you by?

16:45.178 --> 16:46.440
Mm. I just...

16:46.483 --> 16:49.225
I wanted to check in
with you about...

16:49.269 --> 16:50.487
us.

16:50.531 --> 16:53.360
What about us?

16:54.361 --> 16:56.972
Selling your house,
and this van and...

16:57.016 --> 16:58.017
Vincent.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.409
Right.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.584
[both chuckle]

17:00.628 --> 17:04.066
Um, are you doing all this
'cause of me?

17:04.110 --> 17:06.373
No.

17:06.416 --> 17:07.548
Well, maybe.

17:07.591 --> 17:10.638
[chuckles]
It's complicated.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.814
I will admit,

17:12.857 --> 17:15.208
I was a little hurt.

17:15.251 --> 17:17.558
But then I realized I was
just trying to use you

17:17.601 --> 17:19.299
to solve my problems,

17:19.342 --> 17:21.083
and that's not fair
to either of us.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.173
So Vincent is
the solution?

17:24.217 --> 17:26.349
Adventure is the solution.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.047
[chuckles]
I need

17:28.090 --> 17:30.745
to take some chances,
live a bigger life,

17:30.788 --> 17:32.486
figure out who I am.

17:32.529 --> 17:35.576
Drew, this is crazy.

17:35.619 --> 17:36.620
I know, right?

17:36.664 --> 17:37.752
Oh...See, you used to be

17:37.795 --> 17:39.014
the crazy one,
and now it's me.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.363
Hey, maybe your kidney
is to blame.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.409
I was pretty normal
before the transplant.

17:43.497 --> 17:45.064
It's cute that you think that.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.676
Promise me you'll stay in touch?

17:48.719 --> 17:50.460
Promise.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.201
'Cause there's a lot
of bad people out there,

17:52.245 --> 17:54.290
and you got to be careful.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.335
I'm way ahead of you.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.598
I bought some pepper spray.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.469
It even came in its own
little holster.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.471
Drew.

18:01.515 --> 18:02.733
I'll be careful.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.997
Good. Um...

18:06.041 --> 18:07.912
I got a...

18:07.956 --> 18:10.001
a little going-away gift
for you.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.133
You didn't have to do that.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.048
Well, I wanted to.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.574
It's a compass.

18:17.618 --> 18:21.012
Yeah. It's an antique.

18:21.056 --> 18:24.190
So, whether north, south,
east or west,

18:24.233 --> 18:27.018
it'll always show you
your way home.

18:27.062 --> 18:29.412
Well, I was planning
on using Google Maps,

18:29.456 --> 18:30.457
but this is cool.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.023
[laughs]

18:32.067 --> 18:33.199
Thank you.

18:33.242 --> 18:34.809
Yeah.

18:36.593 --> 18:37.507
All right, bye.

18:37.551 --> 18:38.552
Bye.

19:00.095 --> 19:03.707
Yeah. This is a good idea.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.516
Hey.Oh.

19:29.559 --> 19:31.735
Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.476
It's okay.

19:35.043 --> 19:37.045
Looks like I've
been replaced, huh?

19:38.351 --> 19:40.266
You jealous?

19:40.309 --> 19:42.442
A little.

19:42.485 --> 19:45.706
Come here.
There we go... Yeah.

19:45.749 --> 19:48.317
Come here.

19:48.361 --> 19:52.408
Okay. Now, listen...

19:54.410 --> 19:58.327
No matter what,
I'm there for you.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.068
Mm-hmm?

20:00.111 --> 20:01.635
I know.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.987
I love you.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.428
I love you, too.
