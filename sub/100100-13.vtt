THAT SUPER-RARE
CURE-ALL THAT'S

35:23.556 --> 35:25.427
SUPPOSEDLY
IN MY BLOOD,

35:25.471 --> 35:27.821
THOUGH I RAN SEVERAL
TESTS ON MY OWN SAMPLE

35:27.864 --> 35:29.301
LAST WEEK,
AND IT DIDN'T YIELD

35:29.344 --> 35:30.954
ANYTHING EXTRAORDINARY.

35:30.998 --> 35:32.826
UH, SHE KNEW
ABOUT YOUR BLOOD.

35:32.869 --> 35:35.959
HONESTLY, SHE CAN
HAVE IT.

35:36.003 --> 35:40.094
IT'S COST US ALL
WAY TOO MANY PROBLEMS.

35:40.138 --> 35:44.185
AHEM. I WILL BE BACK
LATER.

35:44.229 --> 35:47.232
WAIT. YOU JUST
GOT HERE.

35:59.069 --> 36:02.116
HOW DID NOCTURNA KNOW
ABOUT THE DESERT ROSE?

36:02.160 --> 36:05.424
YOU MEAN, HOW DID YOU
KNOW THAT NOCTURNA KNEW

36:05.467 --> 36:07.556
ABOUT THE DESERT ROSE?

36:07.600 --> 36:10.820
BECAUSE MARY IS ALIVE
BECAUSE, UH, I SAVED HER.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.996
YOU SENT HER
AFTER MARY.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.869
OF COURSE I DID.
IT WAS MARY'S LIFE OR MINE,

36:15.912 --> 36:17.871
AND SOMEONE HAD TO
CHOOSE ME FOR ONCE.

36:17.914 --> 36:22.049
IF YOU WANT ME
TO FEEL GUILTY,
I DON'T.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.746
I NEVER WILL,

36:23.790 --> 36:26.706
NOT AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE.

36:26.749 --> 36:30.318
HMM. SEE, I DON'T
BELIEVE YOU.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.451
I THINK SOMEWHERE
DEEP DOWN

36:32.494 --> 36:35.715
THERE'S A TEENY, TINY PART
OF YOU THAT'S RELIEVED I LIVED,

36:35.758 --> 36:39.936
THAT YOU HADN'T QUITE
FAILED AT SAVING ME.

36:39.980 --> 36:42.983
AND THEY CALL NOCTURNA
A VAMPIRE

36:43.026 --> 36:45.203
WHEN ALL YOU DO IS
FEED OFF MY GUILT

36:45.246 --> 36:47.509
LIKE THE PARASITE
YOU ARE.

36:47.553 --> 36:50.033
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU FEEL GUILTY.

36:50.077 --> 36:52.558
WHAT'S THE END GAME,
ALICE?

36:52.601 --> 36:53.950
WHY'D YOU SAVE MARY?

36:53.994 --> 36:56.388
TO PROVE TO YOU

36:56.431 --> 37:01.219
HOW STUPID YOU WERE
FOR LETTING ME DIE.

37:01.262 --> 37:04.613
STUPID?

37:04.657 --> 37:08.530
STUPID WAS THINKING
THAT MY SISTER
WAS REDEEMABLE.

37:08.574 --> 37:12.839
STUPID WAS
CONVINCING THE CROWS
NOT TO KILL YOU.

37:12.882 --> 37:16.277
STUPID WAS RESCUING YOU
FROM THE GOTHAM RIVER,

37:16.321 --> 37:21.108
CONVINCING DAD THAT
I COULD GET BETH BACK.

37:21.151 --> 37:23.502
STUPID WAS THINKING
THAT YOU COULD

37:23.545 --> 37:27.593
EVER, EVER POSSIBLY
BE WORTH IT.

37:34.730 --> 37:36.950
BUT MAYBE I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GIVE UP ON ME.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.181
MOUSE ONLY HAD
TWO VISITORS--

37:51.225 --> 37:54.489
YOU AND A DR. CAMPBELL.

37:54.533 --> 37:58.363
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS DR. CAMPBELL?

37:58.406 --> 37:59.886
FIGURED YOU'D ASK.

38:03.542 --> 38:07.676
HMM. GOTHAM'S MOST
ELITE PLASTIC SURGEON,

38:07.720 --> 38:12.333
20 YEARS OF LIPO,
RHINO. HMM.

38:14.379 --> 38:18.470
NOW THIS IS INTERESTING.

38:18.513 --> 38:22.038
6 YEARS AGO,
HE TOOK A SABBATICAL.

38:24.389 --> 38:28.044
WHEN HE RETURNED,
DIVORCED HIS WIFE,

38:28.088 --> 38:31.700
STARTED SPECIALIZING
IN FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION

38:31.744 --> 38:35.269
OF CHILD BURN VICTIMS.

38:37.227 --> 38:41.231
6 YEARS AGO, HMM?

38:41.275 --> 38:47.020
WHAT A LONG AND SAD TALE
YOU HAVE, DR. CAMPBELL,

38:47.063 --> 38:53.374
OR SHOULD I PERHAPS CALL YOU
AUGUST CARTWRIGHT?

38:53.418 --> 38:55.985
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

38:56.029 --> 38:59.249
IS THE CATERPILLAR
TRYING TO CONVINCE THE WORLD

38:59.293 --> 39:02.383
THAT'S HE'S A BUTTERFLY?

39:02.427 --> 39:03.993
IF SO...

39:04.037 --> 39:07.649
I WILL FOLLOW
HIM TO YOU...

39:07.693 --> 39:10.391
MY LITTLE MOUSE,

39:10.435 --> 39:12.654
AND TOGETHER...

39:12.698 --> 39:16.092
WE WILL PULL OFF
HIS WINGS.

39:19.052 --> 39:21.837
VESPER: PUT A STAKE IN HER.
SHE IS DONE, GOTHAM.

39:21.881 --> 39:25.188
OUR LOCAL TWO-FANGED MENACE
IS EN ROUTE TO ARKHAM

39:25.232 --> 39:27.016
THANKS TO CROWS SECURITY.

39:27.060 --> 39:29.323
TURNS OUT THEY DIDN'T NEED
A SPECIAL UNDEAD DIVISION

39:29.367 --> 39:32.935
FOR THIS BUST BECAUSE
NOCTURNA, AKA NATALIA KNIGHT,

39:32.979 --> 39:34.937
IS JUST
YOUR RUN-OF-THE-MILL MORTAL

39:34.981 --> 39:37.810
WITH A SKIN CONDITION
AND DENTAL IMPLANTS

39:37.853 --> 39:39.768
THAT INJECTED KETAMINE
INTO HER VICTIMS.

39:39.812 --> 39:41.030
THAT SAID, SHE DID DO
HER DAMAGE...

39:41.074 --> 39:42.423
KETAMINE?

39:42.467 --> 39:44.164
YOU HAVE SPECIAL K
IN YOUR BLOOD.

39:44.207 --> 39:45.948
KETAMINE?

39:45.992 --> 39:47.210
WAIT.

39:47.254 --> 39:48.647
I NEED TO FIND
NOCTURNA.

39:48.690 --> 39:50.388
SHE DRUGGED BATWOMAN
LAST NIGHT.

39:50.431 --> 39:51.737
UH-UH.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.304
WITH A HIDDEN EARPIECE
TO DIRECT LINE

39:54.348 --> 39:56.611
-INTO HIS BOSS?
-I HAVE TO GO. SORRY.

40:05.881 --> 40:08.493
KATE...

40:08.536 --> 40:11.409
