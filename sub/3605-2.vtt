to emerge again.

00:06.799 --> 00:07.914
I'm part of you, Matt.

00:08.050 --> 00:11.008
Whatever you did to me,
I held on.
Now I'm inside your head.

00:11.596 --> 00:13.257
I'm in control here,
not the power.

ANGELA ON PHONE: You’re
supposed to be the man
with the plan, remember?

00:21.772 --> 00:23.023
I'm not sure
I'm that guy anymore.

00:23.107 --> 00:25.644
Why is that?
Because I've lost
my family, Angela.

00:25.735 --> 00:27.191
You know, maybe changing
your name back to Bennet

00:27.278 --> 00:28.609
wasn't such a great
idea after all,

00:28.696 --> 00:31.028
but they say college is
for reinventing yourself.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.948
Have you ever heard
of the Jump-Push-Fall
test?

00:34.076 --> 00:36.533
All we need is a dummy
the approximate size
and weight of Annie.

getourhands
on a dead body?

CLAIRE: / guess she did
kill herself.

00:45.338 --> 00:46.669
I met an empath.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.466
You talk to him?

00:51.761 --> 00:53.467
Didn't really
get a chance.

No, darling.
This batch isn't for you.

01:59.287 --> 02:03.451
I think...
I think I found someone
to fill Joseph's shoes.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.118
I'm going out.

02:07.753 --> 02:08.788
Wearing that?

02:09.213 --> 02:11.750
I'd draw unwanted attention
being myself.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.749
Haven't worn a suit
since I was a boy.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.302
Our parents forced us
to be prim.

02:19.390 --> 02:25.477
Binding us to a life
of combed hair
and shined shoes.

02:27.732 --> 02:32.943
And then I discovered
I could control
the very earth under my feet.

02:34.113 --> 02:36.069
And I was liberated.

02:36.949 --> 02:38.234

No. Thank you.

02:57.303 --> 02:59.464
It's my responsibility.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.056
Ever since Joseph died,

03:01.140 --> 03:06.100
I feel like the lights
don't shine as bright
in here.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.645
I feel like I'm missing
a part of myself.

03:10.858 --> 03:11.938
He was my compass.

03:12.193 --> 03:14.024
And I'm afraid of
where we're going
without it.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.102
I need it back.
I'm sorry for your loss,

03:16.197 --> 03:19.610
but you know
you cannot replace
your brother.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.907
No, you don't understand.

03:22.495 --> 03:25.612
We have a need.
And I have a candidate.

03:28.501 --> 03:33.541

No. I left that life.

There's no mistake,

from the 424 bus

17:10.113 --> 17:12.069

at Lexington and 53rd.

so fast, so negligent,

what's your major?

20:37.987 --> 20:40.319

it was Art History.

I saw this girl

20:52.377 --> 20:54.959
She was born with

let her feel any pain.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.292

that she could cut her hand

20:58.383 --> 20:59.793
or burn herself
and not even know.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.920

cloistered.

interested in that?

29:03.659 --> 29:04.648
Gretchen.

29:11.125 --> 29:13.286
I really, really
want to trust you,

29:13.586 --> 29:17.170
but my life has been
a complex series
of disasters.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.589
And it's been a really,
really long time

29:20.676 --> 29:23.258
since I felt safe enough
to tell anyone the truth.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.723
But I'm tired of keeping
this secret to myself.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.021

29:34.357 --> 29:35.642
I'll tell you the truth.

Mr. Petrelli.
I didn't expect
to see you again.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.331
You look like you've been
running all over the city.

29:54.418 --> 29:56.124
I need to apologize to you.

Thank you.

30:03.844 --> 30:05.050
I'm gonna make it right.

30:06.389 --> 30:08.050
No need to
concern yourself.

30:09.892 --> 30:12.099
There must be
something I can do.

30:23.948 --> 30:28.112
I used to help families
through the worst pain
imaginable.

30:30.913 --> 30:36.283
Joseph and I grew up nearby.
I thought I'd go back home

30:37.420 --> 30:38.785
to remember
the good times.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.665
Can't bring yourself
to go?

mixed in with the good.

30:46.804 --> 30:49.511

started as one thing

30:49.598 --> 30:51.259

into something else.

30:53.102 --> 30:55.764
Can't seem to find
any solace anywhere.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.893
Grieving is messy.

31:02.445 --> 31:03.434
I saw it all the time.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.774
People can offer
their condolences,

31:06.866 --> 31:08.731
they can tell you
they're sorry for your loss,

31:08.826 --> 31:13.320
but they don't know
what it is
that you're feeling.

31:14.165 --> 31:16.201
What would you say
to people?

31:17.293 --> 31:19.955
Just sit with them.
Be with them.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.083
I'd let them know
that they're not alone.

31:23.299 --> 31:25.130
So, what made you
become a paramedic?

31:26.927 --> 31:29.794
I wanted to save lives
instead of watching them pass.

31:35.686 --> 31:38.302
You're exactly
who I hoped you'd be.

31:43.486 --> 31:45.477

For everything.

31:51.494 --> 31:52.950
You know,
it's not for nothing,

31:53.037 --> 31:55.744
but if you made the trip
all the way out here,

31:55.831 --> 31:57.662

that you should
visit your home.
