01:18.359 --> 01:19.986
Let's go! Move it!

01:21.862 --> 01:23.352
50 more yards!

01:23.464 --> 01:24.829
All right, let's go! Pick it up!

01:24.932 --> 01:26.331
-Let's go!
-Yes, sir!

01:26.433 --> 01:29.094
You're running out of time, Bryant!

01:29.202 --> 01:30.965
Make it all the way around the track!
Come on!

01:31.070 --> 01:32.901
You want to be troopers?
You better move it!

01:33.005 --> 01:34.495
All right, next, get up here!

01:34.607 --> 01:36.006
Let's hit it now.

01:36.109 --> 01:37.235
Dean, come on!

01:37.343 --> 01:40.471
All right.
You've all completed the written exam.

01:40.613 --> 01:44.139
However, you must now pass
the obstacle course

01:44.249 --> 01:46.774
to be admitted into the training program.

01:46.885 --> 01:49.718
And remember, survive this,

01:49.821 --> 01:52.790
and you're on the front lines
of keeping New Jersey safe.

02:28.858 --> 02:29.916
Yeah.

02:52.079 --> 02:54.070
Sorry about the test, Dad.

02:55.149 --> 02:58.243
We all have our crosses to bear, sweetheart.

02:58.352 --> 03:00.547
Mine is named hypoglycemia.

03:00.655 --> 03:04.055
Well, that's why you always have to have
sugar nearby.

03:05.192 --> 03:07.057
Are you gonna have pie?

03:08.829 --> 03:10.729
Not tonight, Ma.

03:10.831 --> 03:14.062
I'm just kidding.
Yeah, I'm gonna want some pie.

03:16.336 --> 03:17.462
You...

03:18.572 --> 03:21.472
No, I meant now, Ma. Get the pie now.

03:22.708 --> 03:24.699
-Okay.
-You said it,

03:24.810 --> 03:28.268
and I just kind of got that
stuck in my head now,

03:28.380 --> 03:31.440
and can't really get it out. Pie. Here we go.

03:33.152 --> 03:34.779
It really helps heal.

03:34.887 --> 03:37.787
And, you know, not always, but sometimes,

03:37.889 --> 03:41.416
you gotta do like the kids say,
and just say, "Whatever."

03:41.526 --> 03:42.652
Kids don't talk like that.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.990
Some do, sweetheart. The older ones, okay?

03:45.096 --> 03:47.496
I hear them in the mall. You know?

03:49.100 --> 03:50.590
Peanut butter.

03:51.636 --> 03:54.263
It just fills the cracks of the heart.

03:56.373 --> 03:58.238
Go away, pain.

04:02.679 --> 04:04.738
-What?
-Paulie.

04:04.848 --> 04:06.873
Oh, no. Come on, Ma.

04:06.984 --> 04:08.713
I'm not ready for this right now.

04:08.819 --> 04:10.046
-Dad.
-Please.

04:10.152 --> 04:14.088
We just don't want to see you go through
another holiday alone.

04:14.190 --> 04:15.817
But I'm not alone.

04:15.925 --> 04:17.790
I've got you two. You know?

04:17.894 --> 04:20.522
And besides, Black Friday's coming,

04:20.630 --> 04:23.121
so my dance card's gonna be pretty full.

04:23.232 --> 04:26.029
What?
It's the busiest shopping day of the year.

04:26.134 --> 04:28.568
Yeah, I should have known better
than to try to explain it to civilians.

04:28.670 --> 04:31.730
I wish I had a coworker here, like, "Tyler,
hey. You know, Black Friday's coming."

04:31.840 --> 04:33.603
"Gee, Paul, you don't have to tell me
Black Friday's coming.

04:33.708 --> 04:34.732
"Why do you think
I've been walking around here

04:34.843 --> 04:36.037
"with the eyes of an eagle?"

04:36.144 --> 04:38.578
-We prepare.
-Dad, what does all that have to do

04:38.680 --> 04:40.773
with being happy for the rest of your life?

04:40.882 --> 04:45.545
You said, and I quote,
"lf I don't have a girlfriend by November,

04:45.653 --> 04:48.918
"I'll let you sign me up
for perfectmatch.com."

04:50.024 --> 04:51.719
That was last year.

04:58.431 --> 04:59.489
Okay.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.261
-Here we are.
-Okay.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.929
"What are you looking for in a woman?"

05:06.039 --> 05:09.099
Well, your mother certainly
had something special.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.809
Yeah, illegal immigrant status.

05:13.913 --> 05:16.472
She married you, got citizenship,
and then she left us.

05:16.582 --> 05:18.516
That's not entirely true.

05:18.617 --> 05:22.610
We did have some good times
back when she was still trying to trick me.

05:22.721 --> 05:24.951
-Well, I hate her.
-Well, you shouldn't.

05:25.057 --> 05:26.649
She gave me you.

05:28.393 --> 05:30.986
-I am pretty great.
-You are. You are.

05:31.596 --> 05:34.156
Okay, next question.
"Tell us about yourself."

05:34.932 --> 05:36.729
Let's see.

05:36.834 --> 05:38.199
I know a lot about sharks.

05:38.302 --> 05:40.429
Let me stop you right there.

05:41.539 --> 05:47.135
Well-built and a great hugger.

05:47.243 --> 05:48.710
Awesome, Grandma.

05:48.812 --> 05:50.973
Not as awesome as this.

05:51.081 --> 05:52.343
What are you doing?

05:52.449 --> 05:56.783
Beefing up your profile with that
nifty video that you made a few years back.

05:56.886 --> 05:58.217
Ma, no.

06:16.071 --> 06:20.097
I don't know. Don't you think
it's a little too, "Hey, look at me"?

06:20.208 --> 06:22.676
Well, that is exactly what we want.

06:22.777 --> 06:24.244
Eyes on the prize.

06:24.345 --> 06:27.508
And don't worry,
I will edit out the sweaty parts.

06:55.341 --> 06:56.569
Dear God!

06:59.612 --> 07:02.308
Hey! Back away from the vehicle.

07:02.982 --> 07:04.745
Oh, dear God. Please.

07:05.151 --> 07:06.846
Chompers, get down!

07:28.405 --> 07:29.667
Hey, you know where a men's room is?

07:29.773 --> 07:31.673
I do.
You're gonna want to go to Lord and Taylor.

07:31.775 --> 07:33.709
They got 12 stalls and heated seats.

07:37.448 --> 07:40.349
Okay, keep the balls in the pit, kids. Kids!

07:41.751 --> 07:43.514
Okay, my lip is numb.

07:48.925 --> 07:50.256
All righty.

07:52.962 --> 07:56.193
-There you go.
-Thank you.

08:24.859 --> 08:25.883
Hey.

08:27.561 --> 08:28.994
Yeah, I know.

08:33.198 --> 08:36.259
That's not supposed to be here.
It's a minivan.

08:37.537 --> 08:41.166
...he can't handle it.
The puck travels to the far board...

08:41.975 --> 08:43.909
He keeps the play alive.

09:06.364 --> 09:08.264
-Paul!
-Hey.

09:08.366 --> 09:09.663
What is this?

09:09.767 --> 09:12.065
That's my report on how to ease
traffic flow from Macy's

09:12.170 --> 09:13.728
down through the specialty shops.

09:13.838 --> 09:16.898
-How's that working out for you?
-Actually, it's for all of us.

09:17.008 --> 09:19.407
You see, if we could reroute the customers
away from the food court,

09:19.509 --> 09:22.478
it's gonna help the kiosks
and cut down on shopper frustration.

09:22.579 --> 09:25.605
It's your classic two-bird,
one-stone scenario.

09:27.517 --> 09:29.678
-Can I ask you something?
-Anything.

09:29.786 --> 09:34.086
Why can't you just punch in, shut up
and punch out like the rest of us?

09:35.124 --> 09:37.183
Safety never takes a holiday.

09:37.293 --> 09:39.386
Did your mom crochet that on a pillow?

09:39.495 --> 09:40.621
Blart.

09:42.331 --> 09:45.266
This is Sims. He's a new trainee.
Let him trail you today.

09:45.367 --> 09:48.632
Hey. Paul Blart. Ten-year veteran.

09:48.737 --> 09:50.966
Wow. Veck Sims.

09:51.539 --> 09:55.566
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.
Let's mount up.

09:58.012 --> 10:00.344
Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.719
That's it. Treat her gentle, son.

10:09.323 --> 10:11.086
Slap it, honor it.

10:12.693 --> 10:15.594
So what made you want to pursue security?

10:21.935 --> 10:24.528
I never finished high school.
This is all I could get.

10:24.637 --> 10:27.128
Yeah, I'm currently working on becoming
a state trooper, myself.

10:27.240 --> 10:30.368
Right now, I'm goose egg for eight.
Hypoglycemia.

10:36.916 --> 10:39.850
Confusing, right? Cut yourself some slack.

10:39.951 --> 10:42.351
My first week riding on the job,
I got lost behind the Sears.

10:42.454 --> 10:46.390
They found me later in the fetal position,
sporting a full beard.

10:46.491 --> 10:48.049
I'm kidding. I can't grow a beard.

10:48.159 --> 10:50.093
My uncle can. Stay snug.

10:50.729 --> 10:53.755
Now, in the event
that you approach an assailant,

10:53.865 --> 10:56.697
here's what I want you to do.
You're gonna pull up,

10:56.800 --> 11:01.464
Ieft hip forward, placing your right hand
on your away hip thusly,

11:01.572 --> 11:05.668
giving the illusion that you have a gun.
Which, of course, we both know

11:05.776 --> 11:07.073
you don't.

11:07.945 --> 11:10.436
Okay? But you know what we do have?

11:10.814 --> 11:13.077
Our voices! We have our voices.

11:13.883 --> 11:16.511
If you remember one thing
from today, it's this.

11:16.619 --> 11:21.215
The mind is the only weapon
that doesn't need a holster.

11:22.492 --> 11:24.653
Right. Awesome.
How long do we get for lunch?

11:24.761 --> 11:27.924
Half hour. But I eat in 20, which leaves me
five minutes for social time,

11:28.031 --> 11:30.225
five minutes to get refocused.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.669
We got a high roller.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.312
Sir, I'm gonna need you to pull to the right.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.848
Please pull to the side, sir. Out of traffic.

11:48.950 --> 11:53.080
Tan jacket, red scooter,
please pull to the right, out of traffic.

11:53.187 --> 11:54.245
Sir.

11:57.191 --> 11:58.488
Thank you.

12:11.471 --> 12:13.701
Driving kind of recklessly back there, sir.

12:13.807 --> 12:15.240
You're kidding.

12:15.342 --> 12:18.003
I don't joke about shopper safety.

12:18.110 --> 12:19.702
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
issue you a citation.

12:19.812 --> 12:22.781
Gonna need your first and last. Last first.

12:23.816 --> 12:25.875
Sir. Sir. Sir, sir, sir.

12:27.152 --> 12:29.313
Please don't make this more difficult
than it needs to be, okay?

12:29.421 --> 12:32.913
Are you able to...
Sir. Sir! Sir. I am warning you, sir.

12:37.362 --> 12:39.057
You're pushing it.

12:39.964 --> 12:42.159
Sir. Sir. I am warning... Sir.

12:43.034 --> 12:46.663
Sir. Sir. Sir.

12:50.173 --> 12:51.231
Okay.

12:52.342 --> 12:55.743
This is adding up, sir. He'll be back.
He'll be back. He'll be back.

13:25.206 --> 13:27.504
-Hey.
-Hi. Do you need something?

13:29.277 --> 13:32.075
Yes. I'd like to welcome you to our mall.

13:32.847 --> 13:34.405
Well, thank you.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.257
Is there something else?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.449
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

13:47.561 --> 13:50.621
Just looking for some hair extensions.

13:50.731 --> 13:53.825
Need a little more volume up top.
Do you do men?

13:54.667 --> 13:58.103
Do you do men hair? Do you do men hair?
On the men?

13:58.204 --> 14:01.173
Are you the guy
that crashed into the minivan?

14:02.375 --> 14:04.536
I don't think so. Which one?

14:04.644 --> 14:07.306
Well, that one. That one right there.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.675
Yeah. That one, yes. That...
You know, that one was me.

14:11.783 --> 14:13.978
-Oh, wow. Are you okay?
-Oh, yeah. Never better.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.849
Although they're docking the paycheck
pretty good.

14:15.954 --> 14:17.319
Yeah.

14:17.422 --> 14:19.686
You know what you should do?
You should get the security tape,

14:19.791 --> 14:23.318
and then, like, sell it to one of those shows,
you know, where people crash into stuff.

14:23.428 --> 14:26.192
-Hello, early retirement.
-Yeah, right?

14:27.832 --> 14:31.290
Volume. Right, let me just see what I've got.

14:36.006 --> 14:39.737
Yeah, this is Blart.
If you need me, I'm over by the kiosks.

14:40.544 --> 14:41.943
Who is this?

14:44.581 --> 14:47.675
It's Officer Blart, reporting from Sector 5.

14:48.284 --> 14:50.377
What the hell are you bothering me for?

14:52.122 --> 14:54.647
-Just a Code B check.
-What a moron.

14:55.458 --> 14:57.619
You know, I'll check in with them later.
It's pretty intense.

14:57.727 --> 15:00.559
Oh, right, yeah. Life of a security guard.

15:02.698 --> 15:05.758
-What, what?
-No, it's just that you said security guard,

15:05.868 --> 15:07.267
and it's perfectly acceptable...

15:07.369 --> 15:09.064
I'm so sorry if I called you the wrong thing.

15:09.171 --> 15:10.832
No, no, no, no. You did fine, you know?

15:10.939 --> 15:13.169
It's just that there's a huge,
huge controversy

15:13.308 --> 15:14.502
brewing in the industry right now,

15:14.610 --> 15:17.134
whether the title should be
Security Guard or Officer.

15:17.245 --> 15:19.372
I'm sure you heard about it.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.744
-I didn't.
-You will. You're gonna.

15:21.849 --> 15:24.579
-But I'm sure I will.
-It's out there.

15:26.154 --> 15:29.123
So, you all set
for the busiest shopping day of the year?

15:29.223 --> 15:33.249
Yeah, right.
And the worst day for a birthday.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.818
This year, it falls on a Black Friday, which
means I probably won't even get a card.

15:36.930 --> 15:39.091
Everyone's too busy shopping.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.392
You know what? Yeah. Autumn Ash.

15:42.502 --> 15:43.799
-Yeah.
-I think that's your color.

15:43.904 --> 15:46.498
-I think this'll work.
-It's a winner.

15:47.340 --> 15:50.035
-So that's $9.95.
-$9.95?

15:50.142 --> 15:51.666
-Yeah.
-Wow.

15:51.777 --> 15:54.974
At those prices,
now you got me thinking ponytail.

15:55.981 --> 15:57.778
All right. Thank you.

15:58.450 --> 15:59.781
Thank you.

16:00.819 --> 16:03.413
-Right. So there you go.
-Okay.

16:03.522 --> 16:04.613
And, there you go.

16:06.391 --> 16:08.154
Thank you, Amy.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.124
Thank you, Officer Blart.

16:10.862 --> 16:14.855
Hey, Blart. Wow, nice shirt.

16:14.966 --> 16:16.866
You went with a medium?

16:17.535 --> 16:19.025
It's a bit formfitting,

16:19.137 --> 16:21.604
but that's 'cause we're required to wear
protective vests under our...

16:21.705 --> 16:23.332
No. Not buying it. No.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.465
'Cause I don't see any vest
underneath here, so...

16:25.576 --> 16:28.101
No, but it's a thick T-shirt.
Basically like a thermal they have you wear.

16:28.212 --> 16:30.442
Nope. Nope. No.

16:31.882 --> 16:34.544
I don't understand why you're laughing.
I just called you fat.

16:34.651 --> 16:36.243
I'm not laughing.

16:40.256 --> 16:42.156
Yeah, whatever. Amy.

16:42.258 --> 16:45.318
Hey, everyone's going to American Joe's
tonight, and I want to see you there.

16:45.428 --> 16:47.623
Okay?
We're gonna split some onion strings.

16:47.730 --> 16:49.595
Wow. Wow.

16:50.299 --> 16:51.357
Good.

16:52.468 --> 16:53.764
Good hang.

16:54.836 --> 16:57.464
Wow, yeah. That's great.

16:57.939 --> 17:01.340
Hey, Blart, they need you
at Victoria's Secret.

17:02.944 --> 17:04.536
Okay, roger that.

17:07.682 --> 17:10.172
Okay, I gotta go.

17:10.284 --> 17:11.808
Okay. Bye.

17:22.162 --> 17:23.789
-I found it first.
-No, you didn't.

17:23.896 --> 17:26.160
Ladies. Problem.

17:26.266 --> 17:27.893
What's the genesis?

17:28.001 --> 17:31.164
She's trying to take
the last push-up bra in this size.

17:31.271 --> 17:34.001
There's gonna be a new shipment tomorrow.
They'll be here by noon.

17:34.107 --> 17:35.938
Well, I need this one now.
I have a date tonight.

17:36.042 --> 17:38.033
Really? Is he blind?

17:39.612 --> 17:41.944
Whoa!
Waterproof shoes and Baggies on the socks.

17:42.048 --> 17:43.275
Not my first rodeo.

17:43.382 --> 17:45.873
Okay, ladies, need to see some lD.

17:45.984 --> 17:47.451
No, you don't.

17:49.688 --> 17:53.283
Ma'am, I should warn you, I do have
the authority to make a citizen's arrest.

17:53.392 --> 17:55.326
So does anyone.
I could arrest you right now.

17:55.427 --> 17:58.987
-That's true. She could.
-Hey, not talking to you. Okay?

18:00.598 --> 18:03.362
Can I see you for a second, please, ma'am?

18:12.276 --> 18:16.644
Look, I understand your sensitivity.

18:16.746 --> 18:19.681
I've had some issues with weight myself.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.948
-Are you calling me fat?
-No. No, no, no, no.

18:24.054 --> 18:25.646
I'm just saying I've been down that road.

18:25.755 --> 18:30.089
I mean... I mean, I'm still on it.
We both are, you know? Stranded.

18:30.193 --> 18:33.719
Let's face it, we eat to fill a void, right?

18:33.829 --> 18:37.162
But as soon as I started eating healthier,

18:37.266 --> 18:39.461
I noticed I wasn't so moody.

18:39.568 --> 18:42.128
And PS, your skin's gonna clear up.

18:43.672 --> 18:45.731
-Can you hold onto these?
-Sure.

18:48.843 --> 18:49.969
Ma'am.

19:02.423 --> 19:03.548
You...

19:06.159 --> 19:08.923
She's got tremendous upper body strength.

19:10.364 --> 19:12.594
Backup! Backup!

19:13.233 --> 19:16.134
She's biting my neck. She's biting my neck.

19:17.204 --> 19:18.364
Backup!

19:22.441 --> 19:24.841
Backup! Backup!

19:29.348 --> 19:31.179
Look, I know you're new here and all,

19:31.283 --> 19:34.844
but "backup" seems like
a pretty universal term.

20:48.322 --> 20:50.688
Hey. Can I give you a lift?

20:50.791 --> 20:52.122
What, on that?

20:52.226 --> 20:54.421
With an inexperienced driver
I would recommend no,

20:54.528 --> 20:57.587
but with me,
you'll be as safe as the President.

20:59.065 --> 21:02.557
I don't know. Couldn't that get you fired?

21:02.669 --> 21:04.193
Yes, it could.

21:06.639 --> 21:07.697
Okay.

21:18.884 --> 21:21.216
-ls this all right?
-Absolutely.

22:23.878 --> 22:28.247
And here you go. Safe and sound.

22:30.818 --> 22:33.309
-'65 Mustang.
-Yeah.

22:33.421 --> 22:37.322
Fun fact for you, a lot of people think
the Mustang was named after the horse.

22:37.424 --> 22:40.086
It was actually named after
the P-51 Mustang.

22:42.396 --> 22:45.024
-That's a plane.
-I didn't know that.

22:47.234 --> 22:49.725
Well, thank you for the ride, Paul.
That was so much fun.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.166
No problem.

22:55.274 --> 22:56.468
Listen,

22:57.510 --> 23:00.570
if you ever, you know, need rides anywhere,

23:01.581 --> 23:04.106
Dispatch, they can get me. You know.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.946
-Or we could just text each other.
-Yeah.

23:07.752 --> 23:10.243
-Yeah, give me your cell phone.
-My cell?

23:10.355 --> 23:12.755
Yeah, and I'll punch my number in.

23:16.094 --> 23:18.358
Left it in the casuals. You know what?

23:18.463 --> 23:20.488
Just give me your number
and I'll remember it.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.965
-Okay. Ready?
-Yep.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.535
-All right. 555...
-Not yet. Just...

23:26.203 --> 23:27.261
Now I'm ready.

23:27.371 --> 23:28.895
-555...
-555...

23:29.006 --> 23:30.200
-...01...
-...01...

23:30.307 --> 23:31.774
-...78.
-Eight. Got it.

23:31.875 --> 23:33.001
That's it. It's locked.

23:33.110 --> 23:36.375
Great, so I'll see you tonight
at American Joe's, right?

23:36.981 --> 23:39.347
Yeah, I mean, everybody's going, so...

23:39.450 --> 23:41.246
-Yeah.
-...why not me, too? I'll be...

23:41.351 --> 23:42.443
Yeah, I'm there.

23:42.552 --> 23:44.816
-Great. Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

24:49.581 --> 24:51.674
-Hey.
-Hey! Hey. Glad you made it, Paul.

24:51.784 --> 24:53.342
Good to be here.

24:53.986 --> 24:55.920
-Fun fact for you...
-This place sucks.

24:56.021 --> 24:58.785
-You want to get out of here?
-No.

24:58.891 --> 25:00.552
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

25:00.659 --> 25:02.523
No, I was just saying that

25:02.627 --> 25:06.996
the first American Joe's actually opened
its doors in 1972.

25:07.098 --> 25:10.431
And most people,
because of its service and theme,

25:10.535 --> 25:14.596
think that it's derivative of Abe and Louie's,
but it's not.

25:14.706 --> 25:16.537
It's its own thing.

25:18.041 --> 25:20.703
You really know a lot of facts, Paul.

25:20.811 --> 25:24.645
Hey, Blart, I heard you got your ass handed
to you by a fat chick at Victoria's Secret.

25:24.748 --> 25:26.613
Well, I don't hit women,

25:26.717 --> 25:30.175
-so I don't even know what...
-Yeah. Just minivans, right?

25:31.521 --> 25:35.889
Hey, why don't you go over to the bar
and grab yourself one of those girly drinks?

25:35.991 --> 25:39.518
-I'll meet you over there.
-Okay. Does anybody else want a drink?

25:39.628 --> 25:41.926
-'Cause Stuart's buying.
-No, no, no. They're good. They're good.

25:42.031 --> 25:44.966
-So... They're good.
-Okay.

25:49.238 --> 25:54.140
Hey, listen, l...
We're basically already together, so...

25:54.242 --> 25:56.107
I wasn't... I didn't even realize that.

25:56.211 --> 25:57.405
-And I was... I wouldn't... Doing anything.
-Yeah.

25:57.512 --> 25:58.877
I just want you to grab a hold of it, tight.

25:58.980 --> 26:00.038
-Okay?
-I got it.

26:00.148 --> 26:03.345
I mean,
it's not like you really had a chance, okay?

26:03.451 --> 26:06.317
Security guard? Really.

26:06.420 --> 26:08.354
But you're a pen salesman, dude.

26:08.455 --> 26:11.686
Yeah, and I just bought a Camry,
so you can eat me.

26:12.526 --> 26:15.154
All right, bro. Back off.
You know, we're all just here having fun.

26:15.262 --> 26:16.627
Okay, bro.

26:19.833 --> 26:20.925
What?

26:23.736 --> 26:26.534
Hey, thanks
for getting my back there, brother.

26:26.639 --> 26:29.836
Security blood runs deep between...
Yeah, let's just go.

26:33.212 --> 26:34.941
-Round six.
-Let's do this thing.

26:35.047 --> 26:36.344
-Gentlemen ready?
-No.

26:36.449 --> 26:38.076
Not yet. Now I'm ready. Okay.

26:38.184 --> 26:39.844
And, go!

26:45.223 --> 26:47.418
Leon, I can't give you the Heimlich,
so you better chew.

26:47.526 --> 26:48.686
I know.

26:49.494 --> 26:51.894
Told you, boy. You better hurry up.

26:51.997 --> 26:53.430
There you go. Nachos in my face.

26:53.532 --> 26:56.591
Oh, my God. These peppers.
The peppers are hot.

26:58.269 --> 27:00.794
Oh, my God. Oh, that's a hot pepper.

27:01.672 --> 27:03.435
Nachos are good, man.

27:04.575 --> 27:08.341
Better inform all your friends, boy.
Nachos about to be gone.

27:09.680 --> 27:11.579
You're lagging behind.

27:12.182 --> 27:14.150
Come on, Paul. Playing games.

27:16.820 --> 27:19.812
I love these nachos, I'll tell you that much.

27:21.758 --> 27:23.783
-That lemonade is insane.
-Yeah, Paul.

27:23.893 --> 27:27.351
-That's because it's a margarita.
-No. I don't drink.

28:01.294 --> 28:02.921
Twist it.

28:03.563 --> 28:05.497
Feel the nub.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.828
-Hey, you want some? Here.
-Yeah.

28:12.806 --> 28:14.296
You want fruit?

28:28.520 --> 28:30.818
Bye! You blinked! You blinked.

28:32.524 --> 28:35.617
Time to pluck the grape from the vine.

28:37.128 --> 28:41.462
Still got the Baggies! Hot jiggity.

28:43.468 --> 28:45.197
Coming on the left.

28:48.072 --> 28:49.436
False alarm.

28:56.613 --> 28:58.911
Told my mom everything about us.

28:59.950 --> 29:02.043
What are you talking about?

29:03.954 --> 29:07.389
You're acting coy. Come on. It's natural.

29:08.057 --> 29:10.491
You know. You so know.

29:10.593 --> 29:13.187
No, I'm sorry, Paul. I don't know.

29:15.464 --> 29:18.365
Snap. Pop goes the weasel.

29:20.836 --> 29:22.632
So happy!

29:23.872 --> 29:24.930
Yeah!

29:48.462 --> 29:49.588
Yeah!

29:55.001 --> 29:56.935
I believe in magic!

30:00.039 --> 30:01.063
No way!

30:08.114 --> 30:10.604
I'm sorry it didn't work out, dear.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.274
It's fine, Ma.

30:13.385 --> 30:16.411
-Hey, Dad, why don't we check for matches?
-Yes.

30:16.521 --> 30:20.651
Yeah, I don't think so, sweetheart.
I think I'm just gonna turn in.

30:21.727 --> 30:26.130
Well, how about something special
for lunch tomorrow to cheer you up?

30:26.231 --> 30:29.063
I don't think so, Ma. It's fine.

30:35.539 --> 30:37.973
If something's gonna work,
it would be the sloppy joe.

30:38.075 --> 30:41.135
But that would probably... You know.

30:44.948 --> 30:47.508
You know, if you're doing the sloppy joe,
do the sweet potato fries.

30:47.617 --> 30:50.586
But it... Whatever, you know.
Well done. Yeah.

32:24.007 --> 32:25.736
Maya. Hey.

32:27.144 --> 32:30.113
Dad. I'm so sorry.

32:34.017 --> 32:35.314
It's okay.

32:36.686 --> 32:38.984
There are other fish in the sea.

32:39.088 --> 32:41.613
You just gotta keep looking.

32:41.724 --> 32:43.954
And it doesn't matter what you do.

32:44.060 --> 32:47.996
Because once someone takes the time
to get to know the real you,

32:48.097 --> 32:49.689
all bets are off.

32:55.270 --> 32:58.239
If it doesn't work out, you'll always have us.

33:00.275 --> 33:04.439
I'm sorry, sweetie, I popped my ears.
I didn't hear a word you were saying.

33:04.546 --> 33:06.514
You just have to...

33:06.615 --> 33:08.207
Is that a tattoo?

33:10.384 --> 33:12.443
I... Yeah, yeah, it is.

33:13.387 --> 33:15.480
When did you get it?

33:15.589 --> 33:18.114
-I got it last night.
-What is it?

33:19.860 --> 33:22.226
It's the Loch Ness monster.

33:22.329 --> 33:23.796
I don't drink.

33:59.931 --> 34:02.593
-Hey.
-Hi.

34:03.935 --> 34:05.197
That was

34:06.204 --> 34:08.364
a little weird the other night, huh?

34:08.472 --> 34:11.100
Yeah, you know, it had its moments. Yeah.

34:11.208 --> 34:14.871
Was one of them
when I tried to make out with your purse?

34:14.978 --> 34:17.639
You see, alcohol instantly turns to sugar
in the blood.

34:17.746 --> 34:20.341
And what happens is the capillaries...

34:24.621 --> 34:27.987
Yeah, look. A lot of people...

34:30.359 --> 34:33.886
Pretty much everybody, you know, tends
to write me off.

34:34.697 --> 34:37.598
And if you did, too, believe me, I get it.

34:39.134 --> 34:43.230
I just...
I guess what I'm asking is that you don't.

34:47.208 --> 34:49.199
Okay. You know, I'm sorry, I've just...

34:49.310 --> 34:51.175
I've gotta cash my paycheck
before the bank closes. I'm...

34:51.279 --> 34:52.643
No problem.
Maybe we could talk later or something?

34:52.746 --> 34:54.442
-Yeah, sure. You could just text me, or...
-Okay.

34:54.549 --> 34:57.040
-Yeah.
-I can do that. I can do that.

34:59.921 --> 35:02.549
You know, Paul, everybody texts these days.

35:02.657 --> 35:04.783
I can't believe you don't have a cell phone.

35:04.891 --> 35:06.916
I'm not about all this technology, Vijay.

35:07.027 --> 35:11.123
I prefer face-to-face interaction
or a nice handwritten sentiment.

35:12.165 --> 35:13.530
300 bucks?

35:13.634 --> 35:18.333
I dug myself into a really deep hole
with this girl, you gotta help me. Please.

35:20.640 --> 35:24.076
Paul, you've always been a straight shooter,
so I'll tell you what.

35:24.176 --> 35:26.940
Why don't you take my daughter
Parisa's phone?

35:27.046 --> 35:29.344
-No, I can't do that.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

35:29.448 --> 35:30.608
I'm punishing her.

35:30.716 --> 35:34.311
No. What with all the parties
and that ex-boyfriend Pahud,

35:34.420 --> 35:36.182
she went over her minutes.

35:36.288 --> 35:39.917
When and if she decides to turn
her life around, I'll simply take it back.

35:40.025 --> 35:41.890
Until then, you use it.

35:43.995 --> 35:45.485
-Thanks.
-Sure.

35:45.597 --> 35:48.031
-Stay within the minutes.
-Of course.

35:49.868 --> 35:52.768
Hey. It's too late to go in that way, guys.
It's closed.

35:52.870 --> 35:55.668
-No one's going in there.
-Yeah. I think we are.

36:06.450 --> 36:08.508
Hey, yo, Paul. Come here, man.

36:09.986 --> 36:13.581
Look, I know you been feeling down,
so I got this for you.

36:15.091 --> 36:16.854
"The Devil's Crotch."

36:18.061 --> 36:19.995
Feel the burn, baby.

36:20.096 --> 36:22.587
-Thanks, Leon.
-Get back at me, man.

36:27.903 --> 36:30.098
-Loading dock's ready.
-Got it.

36:37.312 --> 36:38.370
Yeah.

36:47.688 --> 36:49.747
You need a pen, don't you?

36:49.857 --> 36:50.915
You know what? No, I'm good.

36:51.025 --> 36:52.754
-I'll just use one of their pens.
-Yeah, you do.

36:53.894 --> 36:57.329
Yes. The Summit 5280 fountain.

36:57.430 --> 36:59.625
-That's stunning.
-Yeah, I know.

36:59.733 --> 37:03.169
How would you like to sign your name
with this panther?

37:03.269 --> 37:04.566
You know what? More than anything.

37:04.671 --> 37:06.468
-Yeah, that'd be great.
-Here. Yeah.

37:06.573 --> 37:08.438
It's yours. I insist.

37:09.409 --> 37:11.001
Oh, hey, guys.

37:11.111 --> 37:12.169
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:12.278 --> 37:14.211
-Hey.
-Don't you just love Fridays?

37:14.313 --> 37:15.940
-Yeah.
-Best night of the week.

37:16.048 --> 37:17.072
Yeah.

37:18.016 --> 37:20.211
-Excuse me. Sorry.
-Hey.

37:20.319 --> 37:22.685
Paul. Paul, can you help me out?

37:22.788 --> 37:24.483
I need to shoot over to the bank
for a minute.

37:24.590 --> 37:26.421
There's a few kids inside,
just finishing up their games.

37:26.525 --> 37:29.050
Could you close up the arcade for me?

37:29.161 --> 37:31.253
-Yeah, sure. No problem, Mr. Ferguson.
-Okay.

37:31.362 --> 37:33.830
-You okay? You seem a little down.
-Yeah, I'm fine.

37:33.931 --> 37:35.831
You know, video game might
cheer you right up.

37:35.933 --> 37:37.491
Nah, I'm on duty.

38:11.467 --> 38:13.492
Welcome to the games!

38:16.205 --> 38:17.297
Get set.

38:18.406 --> 38:19.373
Go.

38:22.644 --> 38:24.771
Foul. Foul.

38:25.380 --> 38:27.405
Foul. Foul.

38:28.016 --> 38:30.246
Foul. Foul.

38:30.552 --> 38:33.783
Foul. Foul. Foul. Foul.

38:34.855 --> 38:35.947
Game over.

38:40.928 --> 38:42.361
We are ready.

39:11.156 --> 39:12.623
Let's do this.

39:22.300 --> 39:23.732
Attention shoppers.

39:23.834 --> 39:25.529
Please make your way to the nearest exits.

39:25.636 --> 39:27.797
Unfortunately, the mall will be closing early.

39:29.507 --> 39:33.034
-Everybody out!
-Everybody out!

39:36.480 --> 39:38.539
Everybody out, now!

39:43.520 --> 39:44.578
You, too!

39:58.300 --> 40:00.962
Hi. Hey! Hey! You got me...

40:11.647 --> 40:14.012
I'm at the West Orange Pavilion Mall.

40:17.385 --> 40:20.684
Hey, yo. Hey, there's some crazy-ass people
trying to take over the mall.

40:20.788 --> 40:23.484
-I'm out of here.
-Everybody on the floor!

40:33.633 --> 40:36.261
Tell them to bring SWAT.
There may be hostages.

40:47.246 --> 40:49.407
What are you doing? Get down.

40:53.552 --> 40:54.576
Oh, my God.

41:00.125 --> 41:03.423
Surprised? I know.

41:03.528 --> 41:05.689
But here's the craziest part.

41:07.432 --> 41:08.956
I'm the leader.

41:17.741 --> 41:20.835
Reports are, they're inside the bank
and they got hostages.

41:20.944 --> 41:24.311
This is Sergeant Howard. I need four units
around the back to secure the perimeter.

41:24.414 --> 41:27.247
See if we can establish visual.
Report back to me immediately.

41:27.351 --> 41:28.648
Let's get all these civilians out of here.

41:28.752 --> 41:30.549
See if we can gain access
into the loading dock.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.383
-Go.
-I'm on it. 94, move 'em out.

41:46.168 --> 41:47.135
Hello?

41:48.237 --> 41:49.601
Feeling alive?

41:50.505 --> 41:51.597
I'm sorry?

41:54.376 --> 41:55.536
Parisa.

41:56.845 --> 42:00.576
She makes you feel alive, doesn't she?

42:02.183 --> 42:06.084
This must be Pahud.
Pahud, no, I'm not with Parisa.

42:06.553 --> 42:08.282
My name's Paul Blart.

42:08.622 --> 42:11.921
Parisa's dad took her cell phone away,
and he lent it to me.

42:12.026 --> 42:16.122
Do not lie to me, Paul Blart.
Do not lie to me.

42:16.230 --> 42:19.165
You are probably
sweating over her right now.

42:19.266 --> 42:20.699
I'm not lying.

42:20.868 --> 42:23.631
I mean, I am sweaty,
but I'm not sweating over anyone.

42:24.170 --> 42:29.403
That woman is like an angelic goddess
who only brings goodness to this world.

42:32.311 --> 42:35.041
Plus, she has some crazy sexy feet.

42:39.451 --> 42:45.447
Paul, the pain of this breakup
is far too much for me to bear, man.

42:45.557 --> 42:48.219
Pahud, no one can blame you
for being upset.

42:48.326 --> 42:51.762
I mean, the holidays are tough enough
without adding heartbreak to the mix.

42:52.698 --> 42:56.463
Wow. Them's some heavy words, Paul Blart.

42:57.168 --> 42:59.534
Hey, life is heavy.

43:00.671 --> 43:04.869
Indeed. Now, you are at the mall, huh?

43:04.975 --> 43:08.240
So why do you not head over
to Orange Julius,

43:08.345 --> 43:10.676
call up my friend Sameer Oh?

43:10.780 --> 43:14.147
Tell him you are now my homeboy.
He will hook you up.

43:15.852 --> 43:17.319
Wait a second.
How'd you know I was at the mall?

43:17.821 --> 43:21.086
I track Parisa's phone with GPS.
Don't you judge me.

43:26.429 --> 43:28.225
Closing time already.

43:31.767 --> 43:36.261
Okay, there are 223 stores in this mall.

43:36.371 --> 43:40.467
Here is a list of the 15 that I need you to hit.

43:40.576 --> 43:42.134
And 15 for you.

43:44.879 --> 43:45.971
Okay.

43:46.080 --> 43:50.176
Now this is the key to retrieve the codes
from each store's credit-card machine.

43:50.284 --> 43:52.275
They change every day, so make sure

43:52.386 --> 43:56.322
that you bring me back the codes
for today, Friday.

44:18.244 --> 44:21.213
Veck, six guys in standard formation,
just like you said.

44:21.313 --> 44:22.302
Perfect.

44:24.817 --> 44:27.251
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

44:27.820 --> 44:30.516
And these little piggies went
all the way home.

44:31.590 --> 44:32.613
Do it.

44:43.301 --> 44:46.532
Gary usually delivers the leftovers
to the Mission.

44:49.339 --> 44:51.466
Hey, everyone. A couple requests.

44:51.575 --> 44:54.043
Kindly tie up the person beside you,
keep your mouths shut,

44:54.144 --> 44:59.081
give up your cell phones,
and as a general rule, do as I say.

44:59.183 --> 45:01.777
You do all these things...
Well, you'll be back at home in no time.

45:01.885 --> 45:03.944
Back to your mediocre lives.

45:04.854 --> 45:07.414
-I don't have one.
-Amy.

45:12.528 --> 45:17.693
I was hoping that you and I could have
a whole Bonnie-and-Clyde thing going on.

45:17.800 --> 45:21.530
You know, minus dying
in a hail of gunfire, of course.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.364
What do you say?

45:27.309 --> 45:28.640
Go to hell.

45:29.444 --> 45:30.502
Ouch.

45:32.480 --> 45:35.540
Hey, Stewie, you don't mind
that I'm hitting on your girlfriend, do you?

45:35.650 --> 45:37.947
What? No. She's not my girlfriend.

45:38.052 --> 45:42.386
But I specifically heard you say
that you two were "basically together."

45:42.489 --> 45:47.791
No. I didn't say that we were together.
I said that she's into leather.

45:49.830 --> 45:52.264
Have at it. If you...

45:53.666 --> 45:55.429
God, you're an idiot.

45:57.871 --> 45:58.895
Hello?

45:59.172 --> 46:01.231
This is Sergeant Howard
of the West Orange Police Department.

46:01.341 --> 46:03.707
-Who am I speaking with?
-Hi.

46:03.810 --> 46:05.607
Yeah, well, so here's the deal.

46:06.279 --> 46:09.907
As you learned the hard way,
I have motion sensors by all the doors,

46:10.015 --> 46:11.346
so if you wanna enter my mall,

46:11.450 --> 46:15.910
you might as well bring
at least six body bags.

46:17.055 --> 46:18.750
He's drilling the safe,
and they have eyes on us.

46:18.857 --> 46:20.722
See if we can tap into the security cameras.

46:20.826 --> 46:23.056
Now look, no one's gonna try
and enter the mall.

46:23.161 --> 46:25.686
Is there anything you need? Do you need
any food? Do you need any water?

46:28.232 --> 46:31.963
Oh, man. This dude
doesn't deviate from the book at all.

46:33.337 --> 46:36.397
You know, since you're asking,
I would love a Happy Meal,

46:36.507 --> 46:39.101
you know, but...
Make sure the toy is the sea monster,

46:39.210 --> 46:40.472
'cause I already have the dragon.

46:40.578 --> 46:43.444
Okay, okay, now what is it you really want?

46:44.748 --> 46:45.942
Silence.

46:51.922 --> 46:54.516
Hey, I'm sorry, mall's closed,

46:54.624 --> 46:58.719
but I can help you find the nearest exit
if you just tell me where you parked.

46:59.295 --> 47:00.626
Sweet mercy.

47:02.398 --> 47:05.026
This is not happening,
this is not happening, this is...

47:08.737 --> 47:12.264
Oh, God. All right, think, Paul, think.

47:13.008 --> 47:15.237
Now what are you trained to do?

47:19.247 --> 47:20.441
Nothing.

47:22.450 --> 47:26.147
Detect, deter, observe, report.
I gotta report it. Reporting it.

47:27.956 --> 47:29.821
Yo, we got a straggler.

47:32.459 --> 47:34.689
-It's a security guard.
-What should we do?

47:34.795 --> 47:38.287
I don't know. Give up, I guess.

47:38.398 --> 47:42.391
Guys, what is wrong with you?
We stick to the plan.

47:42.502 --> 47:45.437
We got a 911 operator connecting us
with some guy named Paul Barth.

47:45.539 --> 47:47.563
He says he's a security officer in the mall.

47:47.673 --> 47:51.006
Hey. Blart? He's one of my guys.

47:51.110 --> 47:53.601
Paul, this is Sergeant Howard
of West Orange Police Department.

47:53.713 --> 47:56.273
The mall has been taken over,
and they have hostages.

47:56.382 --> 47:58.373
I need you to exit the building immediately.

47:58.818 --> 48:01.184
We don't need any wild cards
in this situation.

48:01.287 --> 48:03.948
Copy that. Never been a wild card.

48:04.055 --> 48:06.819
Unless you consider the game of Uno wild.

48:08.026 --> 48:12.292
-Blart! Can we focus here, please?
-Yes. Yes, sir. On my way out.

48:12.397 --> 48:15.798
Okay, okay. Come on, don't die. Don't die.

48:17.035 --> 48:18.468
Blart.

48:19.270 --> 48:21.032
Don't pee. Don't pee.

48:30.781 --> 48:34.308
Guys, motion detector just went off
at Door 26. Everybody on it.

48:39.022 --> 48:40.046
Amy.

48:40.156 --> 48:42.420
What the hell is he doing? Come on!

48:42.525 --> 48:44.686
-Paul, come on!
-Paulie, come on!

48:44.794 --> 48:45.920
-What's he doing?
-Come on, Blart!

48:46.029 --> 48:47.053
Blart, come on!

48:47.163 --> 48:48.926
-Let's go! Move it!
-Come on! Come on!

48:49.032 --> 48:50.522
-Get out of there!
-Come on!

48:52.001 --> 48:53.558
Is he crying?

48:53.668 --> 48:55.727
-I can't leave her.
-Where's he going?

48:55.837 --> 48:56.929
-Blart!
-Where's he going?

48:57.039 --> 49:00.065
Blart, get back! Will you talk to him, please?

49:01.209 --> 49:03.871
Blart, this is Brooks. What's going on?

49:04.546 --> 49:08.346
Sir, I took a sworn oath to protect this mall
and all inside it.

49:08.449 --> 49:09.882
What oath? We don't have an oath.

49:10.951 --> 49:14.148
I sort of made up my own.
It's on a plaque in my room.

49:15.089 --> 49:17.751
Listen, I think you're making a big mistake.

49:17.858 --> 49:19.450
SWAT's on the way.

49:19.994 --> 49:23.691
And I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
you're untrained, you're unarmed,

49:23.798 --> 49:26.698
and let's face it, son,
you present a huge target.

49:27.300 --> 49:30.599
With all due respect, sir,
I can't observe and report from the outside.

49:30.703 --> 49:31.692
Over.

49:31.805 --> 49:35.434
Well, Sergeant,
looks like you got your eyes on the inside.

49:35.975 --> 49:40.674
Amy, Paul Blart here.
Are you still in the mall?

49:41.313 --> 49:42.280
Send.

49:55.427 --> 49:56.621
Got him.

50:20.917 --> 50:22.976
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

50:23.086 --> 50:25.987
Think. Think. Think, think, think,
think, think, think, think! Think!

50:48.276 --> 50:49.868
Hold it together.

50:51.946 --> 50:53.641
Heart of a warrior.

51:06.727 --> 51:08.217
I missed lunch.

51:16.270 --> 51:17.567
Thank you.

51:24.877 --> 51:27.505
This isn't happening, this is not happening.

51:37.255 --> 51:39.553
Hey! Don't make this hard.

51:45.897 --> 51:47.364
You like that?

52:15.959 --> 52:18.757
Brooks, I took out a girl,
but the guy, he ran away.

52:18.861 --> 52:20.988
-Wow, Paul, you got one.
-Yes.

52:21.097 --> 52:24.588
But let the record show,
I did not hit a woman. I just...

52:24.700 --> 52:26.565
I put all my weight on her.

52:27.202 --> 52:28.430
Oh, Paul.

52:29.071 --> 52:31.539
No, no, no. She's fine, she's fine.

52:32.140 --> 52:33.664
Well, good, let's get you out of there.

52:34.376 --> 52:37.539
No can do, sir.
I am gonna finish what I started.

52:38.614 --> 52:40.274
What the heck is this?

52:40.381 --> 52:41.814
Give me that.

52:42.650 --> 52:44.242
Paul, this is Sergeant Howard again.

52:44.352 --> 52:47.219
Since you refuse to come out,
I'm gonna need you to go into the bank

52:47.321 --> 52:49.118
and find out
where they're holding the hostages.

52:50.858 --> 52:52.416
With honor, sir.

52:55.129 --> 52:56.561
Good to know.

53:28.260 --> 53:30.022
Hey, I haven't heard back
from Donner or Vixen.

53:30.128 --> 53:33.063
Okay. I'm calling an audible here, everyone.

53:33.164 --> 53:37.658
And I need to get this mall locked down
from the inside immediately.

53:38.536 --> 53:41.403
Why don't we just start wasting hostages?
That'll stop them.

53:41.506 --> 53:45.874
Well, that's one way to go, but our hostages
are the only thing keeping the cops outside.

54:00.490 --> 54:03.515
I'm Commander Kent. My team is deploying.
I need this location secured.

54:03.626 --> 54:05.184
-We got a three-block perimeter...
-Establish a perimeter

54:05.294 --> 54:06.261
and get all these people out of here.

54:06.362 --> 54:07.590
Whoa, whoa, this is all done already.

54:07.697 --> 54:09.665
My men are gonna do it again, the right way.

54:09.765 --> 54:12.131
Have your guys fall back, now.
Have there been any demands?

54:12.234 --> 54:15.795
-A Happy Meal and absolute silence.
-Well, let's make some noise.

54:15.905 --> 54:19.203
I got snipers at the ready,
communications in check.

54:19.307 --> 54:21.241
Let's tap into security now,
and let's get some visuals.

54:21.343 --> 54:22.742
You can't.
They knocked out the video cameras.

54:22.844 --> 54:28.805
I'll be ready to take on-scene command
in three, two, one. I'm in charge.

54:59.045 --> 55:01.513
Brooks, I'm observing the bank now.

55:02.782 --> 55:05.683
They got one assailant
guarding the hostages.

55:07.886 --> 55:09.649
There she is.

55:09.755 --> 55:12.986
My, God. You are my angel pie.

55:15.927 --> 55:18.122
Here come the love sweats.

55:19.030 --> 55:21.123
Paul, your radio's still on.

55:23.634 --> 55:24.623
Roger that.

55:25.102 --> 55:29.004
-What's going on? Who is that?
-We got a guy on the inside.

55:29.106 --> 55:31.438
Don't tell me one of your beat cops
is trying to be a hero.

55:31.542 --> 55:36.002
No, he's neither. His name is Blart.
He's one of my security guards.

55:36.113 --> 55:38.377
-Wait a minute. Blart?
-Yeah.

55:38.482 --> 55:39.812
-Paul Blart?
-Yeah.

55:39.916 --> 55:43.682
Are you kidding me? We used to abuse
that loser in high school. Give me that.

55:44.320 --> 55:45.480
Blart.

55:45.588 --> 55:48.819
This is Commander James Kent.
New Jersey SWAT.

55:48.925 --> 55:52.019
We went to high school together.
Remember?

55:52.128 --> 55:54.925
I set you on fire at the pancake festival?

55:55.597 --> 55:57.531
Oh, yeah. Hey, Jimmy.

55:58.100 --> 55:59.260
Go Green Hawks.

56:00.135 --> 56:04.128
Yeah, listen. I've got 50 highly trained,
armed professionals out here.

56:04.239 --> 56:06.298
At my command,
we are retaking this location,

56:06.408 --> 56:09.468
and there's no way I'm compromising
this mission so that some mall monitor

56:09.578 --> 56:12.740
who used to eat lunch
with his imaginary friend can screw it up.

56:12.847 --> 56:17.341
Sorry, Jimmy, I had the button pressed.
All I heard was "lunch" and "friend."

56:17.452 --> 56:19.647
Could you do me a favor
and put Chief Brooks back on?

56:19.754 --> 56:20.880
Listen to me, Blart,

56:20.988 --> 56:24.947
you are no longer communicating
with Chief Brooks. Is that clear?

56:27.094 --> 56:28.219
Hello?

56:30.230 --> 56:31.424
Hello?

56:31.531 --> 56:34.591
Yeah? Oh, hey, Paul, how you doing?

56:35.869 --> 56:38.861
Well, it looks like they moved the hostages
into the teller area.

56:38.972 --> 56:40.269
I'm gonna get a closer look.

57:21.879 --> 57:22.937
Veck.

57:25.682 --> 57:26.944
There he is!

57:29.019 --> 57:31.283
-Everyone in the back room, now!
-Come on, move, move!

57:31.388 --> 57:32.479
Let's get in the back, huh?

57:33.756 --> 57:38.352
Brooks. I lost visual on the hostages.
I couldn't get them out.

57:38.461 --> 57:41.555
But I know who the leader is. It's Veck.

57:41.664 --> 57:43.894
Veck? The trainee?

57:44.000 --> 57:47.436
-No. The brainee.
-I don't believe this.

57:48.204 --> 57:49.431
I'll pass it on to Howard.

58:05.553 --> 58:06.747
Oh, God.

58:06.887 --> 58:08.752
Trapped is fine by me.

58:08.856 --> 58:11.552
Commence tanning. Three, two, one.

58:37.583 --> 58:38.641
Yeah!

58:48.527 --> 58:49.551
Yes!

59:04.508 --> 59:06.772
Time for some big-game hunting.

59:31.500 --> 59:34.025
Open, open, open! Thank God.

59:39.241 --> 59:40.401
Oh, no.

59:42.610 --> 59:47.707
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! We get it!

59:53.655 --> 59:55.646
Get him! Get him! Get him!

01:00:02.429 --> 01:00:03.919
You better run.

01:00:07.267 --> 01:00:10.236
-Rudolph, where are you?
-I'm about to end this.

01:00:23.582 --> 01:00:26.142
Amy, huh? What a coincidence.

01:00:26.252 --> 01:00:28.948
We got a cute little redhead
down at the bank named Amy.

01:00:29.055 --> 01:00:31.386
-Strawberry blonde, actually.
-Yeah?

01:00:31.489 --> 01:00:34.151
Well, I guess I know who I'm killing first.

01:00:34.259 --> 01:00:36.819
-Catch you later!
-Yeah?

01:00:36.928 --> 01:00:39.158
Well, it looks like you just ran out of mall.

01:00:39.264 --> 01:00:42.199
It'll be over quick. She won't feel a thing.

01:01:29.578 --> 01:01:33.070
You aren't gonna touch her,
but you are gonna feel this.

01:01:38.052 --> 01:01:40.145
Nobody wins with a head butt.

01:02:00.006 --> 01:02:01.997
-Give me your cell phone.
-I don't have one.

01:02:02.108 --> 01:02:04.201
What are you talking about?
Every kid has a cell phone.

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:06.608
I prefer handwritten sentiments.

01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:12.583
Who are these sloppy joes for?
And who gave you this?

01:02:12.684 --> 01:02:15.915
They're mine.
I'm late for my shift at Foot Locker.

01:02:20.526 --> 01:02:24.189
We're getting the leader on the horn.
He wants to talk to you.

01:02:24.296 --> 01:02:25.853
Silence, my ass.

01:02:26.998 --> 01:02:28.898
What's the matter?
Throw a few jabs your way,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.764
you curl up in a corner, suck your thumb?

01:02:32.737 --> 01:02:34.432
If you don't go toe-to-toe
with that scumbag,

01:02:34.539 --> 01:02:36.734
he's gonna roll over on you all night long.

01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:38.900
It's all right. That's not my style.

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:45.141
Well, just in case, I wrote down
a couple of clever comebacks, like...

01:02:45.248 --> 01:02:46.306
Here.

01:02:47.017 --> 01:02:48.678
This is what you been doing?

01:02:49.419 --> 01:02:51.580
"Yeah, you and what army?"

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:56.086
-What's wrong with that?
-He has an army.

01:03:03.098 --> 01:03:05.999
Everyone deserves a card on their birthday.

01:03:30.191 --> 01:03:32.784
So when you and Rudolph
were laughing it up back at the crib

01:03:32.893 --> 01:03:35.327
about how easy all this was gonna be,
were you guys like,

01:03:35.429 --> 01:03:38.728
"Man, any brain-dead mall cop
that gets in the way is gonna get smoked"?

01:03:38.832 --> 01:03:41.494
And then... And then what?
You guys all high-fived?

01:03:41.602 --> 01:03:46.096
-Veck, this guard is...
-Winning! I know this, because I am all set!

01:03:46.206 --> 01:03:49.470
But sadly, no codes!

01:03:49.575 --> 01:03:53.909
And I'd say, considering
all the luxury items that I have stacked up

01:03:54.013 --> 01:03:59.645
in my Amazon shopping cart,
situation unacceptable!

01:03:59.752 --> 01:04:01.743
No, no, no, no, no, no. He looking.

01:04:02.488 --> 01:04:03.954
Give me a gun.

01:04:06.224 --> 01:04:08.192
Put it down. Put it down.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.450
What are you nodding about?

01:04:10.562 --> 01:04:14.328
I was just wondering,
were you serious about that Happy Meal?

01:04:16.935 --> 01:04:18.766
It isn't coming, is it?

01:04:22.406 --> 01:04:23.430
What?

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:25.701
This is Commander James Kent,
New Jersey SWAT.

01:04:25.809 --> 01:04:27.037
You wanted to speak to me?

01:04:27.144 --> 01:04:30.170
I just wanna make sure
that no one does anything stupid.

01:04:30.281 --> 01:04:33.307
You should know my men are deployed
and ready to bring this thing to a resolution.

01:04:33.417 --> 01:04:35.577
The easy way or the hard way.

01:04:35.685 --> 01:04:37.744
That is such a tough call, but...

01:04:37.854 --> 01:04:41.449
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and go with C,
none of the above!

01:04:43.426 --> 01:04:45.394
I'm Amy, by the way.

01:04:45.495 --> 01:04:48.896
-Amy? From unbeWEAVEable?
-Yeah.

01:04:48.998 --> 01:04:52.558
I'm Maya.
My father talked forever about you.

01:04:53.302 --> 01:04:57.204
And I gotta say, he really does like you.

01:04:57.306 --> 01:04:59.001
I'm gonna throw up.

01:05:16.958 --> 01:05:18.289
Oh, that's not so bad.

01:05:35.942 --> 01:05:37.273
Oh, my God.

01:05:38.945 --> 01:05:40.912
They've got his daughter.

01:05:42.014 --> 01:05:43.709
-Dad?
-Maya.

01:05:44.483 --> 01:05:47.145
-Everything's gonna be okay.
-How's your blood sugar?

01:05:47.252 --> 01:05:50.312
Don't worry about me, okay?
I'm worried about you.

01:05:50.422 --> 01:05:54.552
I love you.
All right, now, I'm gonna get you all out.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.389
You just hang in there, okay, sweetie?

01:05:57.495 --> 01:06:00.259
I will. I'm a Blart, remember?

01:06:00.365 --> 01:06:02.299
Yeah. I'll see you soon.

01:06:04.569 --> 01:06:07.504
I'm supposed to be on my way
to the Cayman lslands with the hostages.

01:06:07.605 --> 01:06:11.097
And where the hell is Rudolph?
He should be back by now.

01:07:18.838 --> 01:07:22.296
"lf Veck gets the codes,
he's taking us to Cayman lslands"?

01:07:24.077 --> 01:07:27.569
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.

01:07:50.302 --> 01:07:51.791
Come and get me, Veck.

01:07:51.902 --> 01:07:54.029
I got your codes
for the credit-card machines.

01:07:54.138 --> 01:07:58.006
-Yo, you hear that? That's Paul, baby!
-Blart?

01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:02.511
That's who's been screwing all this up?
You have got to be kidding me.

01:08:02.613 --> 01:08:03.978
Give me a radio.

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:05.742
Let me tell you something.

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:10.445
You take hostages in my mall,
you are making a big mistake.

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:12.544
You seriously undermissed...

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:17.859
And you seriously...

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:20.288
Oh, no!

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:34.001
Blart?

01:08:39.647 --> 01:08:42.844
Sugar. Sugar.

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:45.612
Blart? You there, Blart?

01:08:51.926 --> 01:08:53.859
Hello, Blart. You there?

01:09:18.082 --> 01:09:19.413
Hey, Blart!

01:09:20.219 --> 01:09:23.279
I was hoping we could get an ETA
of when you're gonna give up.

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:26.716
How about now?

01:09:26.825 --> 01:09:30.282
I'll meet you on the corner of Ne and Ver.

01:09:30.395 --> 01:09:34.194
Yeah, you heard me. Never!

01:09:34.299 --> 01:09:35.788
All right, Dad.

01:09:41.005 --> 01:09:44.531
Hey, fellas! You looking for me?

01:09:47.978 --> 01:09:50.947
Come on. Come on, come on. Come on.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.215
Follow me.

01:09:58.322 --> 01:09:59.721
There he is.

01:10:03.326 --> 01:10:05.157
We got him trapped in Rainforest Cafe.

01:10:05.261 --> 01:10:08.230
Great. Wait for me.
You know, my mom always said,

01:10:08.331 --> 01:10:10.561
"lf you want something done right,
waste the guy yourself."

01:10:10.666 --> 01:10:13.533
I'm paraphrasing, of course. You stay here.

01:10:22.944 --> 01:10:24.809
Prancer, take the back.

01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:35.909
Hey, you. Scuba Dooby-Doo.

01:11:58.334 --> 01:12:01.701
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Can I have my codes now, please?

01:12:01.804 --> 01:12:04.068
Why? No codes, no Cayman lslands?

01:12:04.173 --> 01:12:06.038
Looks like Paul Blart turned into
quite the badass.

01:12:06.141 --> 01:12:07.733
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.

01:12:09.978 --> 01:12:11.035
No.

01:12:11.813 --> 01:12:14.839
One thing I know is
Paul Blart is not a badass.

01:12:39.306 --> 01:12:42.503
Comet! Don't come back till he's dead!

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:50.273
Brooks. Only one more left.
Then it's just me and Veck.

01:12:52.985 --> 01:12:55.180
Okay, who's talking to Blart?

01:12:55.988 --> 01:12:58.286
Was it you, sugar mouth?

01:12:58.391 --> 01:13:00.950
All right. Let's try this again.

01:13:01.059 --> 01:13:02.617
Wait! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

01:13:02.727 --> 01:13:05.252
It's her phone, it's hers.
She's talking to him.

01:13:05.363 --> 01:13:09.390
She's talking to him, and I told her not to.
And it's under her leg.

01:13:09.501 --> 01:13:12.698
The phone. Her right leg. Right there.
That's good.

01:13:13.938 --> 01:13:14.996
Okay.

01:13:18.642 --> 01:13:20.132
That was close.

01:13:20.844 --> 01:13:22.004
He is a pro.

01:13:23.614 --> 01:13:25.844
Listen, Blart, time's up. We're busting in.

01:13:25.949 --> 01:13:28.747
Wait! Look, Veck's after
the credit-card codes, and I got them.

01:13:28.852 --> 01:13:30.410
Just give me a few minutes.

01:13:30.521 --> 01:13:31.545
No problem.

01:13:53.775 --> 01:13:55.333
Isn't that cute?

01:14:16.197 --> 01:14:18.859
-Hey, Amy. I'm on my way.
-Oh, hey, Blart.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.727
Wow. Our boy Stuart just turned me on
to your profile

01:14:22.836 --> 01:14:24.770
on lonelyloser.com.

01:14:26.072 --> 01:14:29.371
"Likes morning rain, walks on the beach."

01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:31.973
Who are you, Olivia Newton-John?

01:14:32.579 --> 01:14:34.809
I was just speaking from the heart.

01:14:34.914 --> 01:14:39.509
Yeah, well, I didn't have to go online, Paul,
to know that you love peanut brittle.

01:14:39.618 --> 01:14:40.642
You're so pathetic.

01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:46.450
Trippy.

01:14:51.597 --> 01:14:53.121
This I can use.

01:14:54.665 --> 01:14:55.893
What do you want, Veck?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.264
I just want the $30 million
that I came here for.

01:14:58.369 --> 01:15:03.033
But, you know, I would settle offing
your dream girl, or maybe your daughter.

01:15:04.509 --> 01:15:06.534
You touch them, I swear I'll end you.

01:15:06.644 --> 01:15:08.077
What're you gonna do, Paul?

01:15:08.179 --> 01:15:11.511
You gonna pull up with your left hip forward
giving the illusion that you have a gun,

01:15:11.615 --> 01:15:13.913
which you and I both know you don't?

01:15:15.252 --> 01:15:18.415
-I could.
-You're not gonna do squat.

01:15:18.522 --> 01:15:21.753
The next time I see you, Paul,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.

01:15:21.858 --> 01:15:25.419
I don't think so. I'm taking you down.

01:15:43.711 --> 01:15:44.837
Blart!

01:15:50.351 --> 01:15:51.648
Oh, Blart.

01:15:59.526 --> 01:16:01.756
Sweet mercy.

01:16:09.836 --> 01:16:13.067
I wish I had a bat. I would bust you open,
see how much candy fell out.

01:16:13.173 --> 01:16:15.003
-Too tight!
-This is not happening.

01:16:15.107 --> 01:16:17.268
-It's not happening.
-Come on.

01:16:43.134 --> 01:16:46.570
Bravo. That was awesome.

01:16:47.938 --> 01:16:52.705
And you were just so close
to making it, too, Paul. Just so close.

01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:55.779
-It's not over yet.
-Yeah, I think it is.

01:16:55.879 --> 01:17:01.078
Now the only thing I need are my codes,
which, judging from your text messages,

01:17:01.185 --> 01:17:05.348
you have been so sweet as to enter them
into your phone just for me.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:10.655
You think I'm gonna carry the phone
with me that actually contains the...

01:17:19.935 --> 01:17:22.301
-Yello?
-Peanut Blart and Jelly.

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:26.841
What's up, man?
So good to hear your voice.

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:28.204
Yeah, it's good to hear
your voice, too, Pahud.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.800
Listen, I'm gonna have to call you back.

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:32.675
-What? When?
-I don't know when. I'll talk to you later.

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:35.682
Okay, Paul, call me back!
Call me back, Paul!

01:17:38.085 --> 01:17:40.747
I mean,
this just keeps getting better and better.

01:17:40.855 --> 01:17:43.790
I mean, you are impossible
to underestimate.

01:17:43.891 --> 01:17:45.722
I mean, you can't pass the trooper exam,

01:17:45.826 --> 01:17:49.785
you black out if you don't have
a Snickers bar like every 20 minutes,

01:17:49.897 --> 01:17:53.559
you had the chance to be the MVP,
and you blew it.

01:17:53.667 --> 01:17:56.830
Again, like you always do.
Ain't that right, Maya?

01:18:06.212 --> 01:18:09.738
What do you want me to say, Veck?
You're smarter than me.

01:18:10.883 --> 01:18:14.649
You're good on computers,
you kept your weight under control.

01:18:15.688 --> 01:18:18.452
I mean, people,
they look at me and you, and...

01:18:18.557 --> 01:18:20.422
Yeah, it's a landslide.

01:18:20.859 --> 01:18:22.417
It's no contest.

01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:25.354
Sorry.

01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:28.992
Right now, you're the man with the gun.

01:18:31.302 --> 01:18:32.792
So here you go.

01:18:50.587 --> 01:18:52.054
Come on!

01:18:52.155 --> 01:18:53.588
Go get him!

01:18:53.690 --> 01:18:54.918
Go, Dad.

01:18:56.927 --> 01:18:58.086
What...

01:19:02.264 --> 01:19:05.028
Probably should have capitalized on that.

01:19:05.735 --> 01:19:06.895
Dad!

01:19:12.541 --> 01:19:15.031
Lock and load, boys. We're going in.

01:19:22.016 --> 01:19:23.449
Hey, we're on the move.

01:19:23.551 --> 01:19:24.779
Let's go.

01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:31.257
Come on, come on, come on.

01:19:46.072 --> 01:19:48.233
Paul. Think, Paul. Think!

01:19:51.177 --> 01:19:55.136
Let's go, men. Take it down.
Secure the suspects.

01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:06.418
Get down!

01:20:07.492 --> 01:20:09.756
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

01:20:13.231 --> 01:20:16.462
Down. The other one. That's the back one.

01:20:16.568 --> 01:20:19.968
No, no. That's the same one. No!
The other one!

01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:22.732
Veck got away with my daughter and Amy.

01:20:23.307 --> 01:20:26.640
Entry team, clear the mall. We'll pursue.

01:20:27.111 --> 01:20:28.305
Light.

01:20:30.948 --> 01:20:32.415
Open the door.

01:20:36.319 --> 01:20:37.752
Let's do this.

01:20:41.591 --> 01:20:43.855
Jimmy, give me your cell phone.

01:20:45.695 --> 01:20:49.825
Gotta hand it to you, Blart.
You're really taking care of business.

01:20:51.834 --> 01:20:52.926
What up?

01:20:53.035 --> 01:20:55.663
Pahud, do you still have GPS
on Parisa's cell phone?

01:20:55.771 --> 01:21:00.071
You know I do, Paul. You know I do.
What can I do for you?

01:21:00.175 --> 01:21:01.836
I need to know where it's headed.

01:21:05.714 --> 01:21:08.045
Paul, it looks like
they're on their way to McGuire Airfield.

01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:10.310
I know where that is. Thanks.

01:21:11.485 --> 01:21:12.713
Hang on.

01:21:16.290 --> 01:21:17.917
My God. There they are.
Jimmy, take the wheel.

01:21:18.025 --> 01:21:19.083
What?

01:21:20.862 --> 01:21:22.727
Here we go! Here we go!

01:21:23.164 --> 01:21:25.097
That was me. I can't...

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:46.944
Here I go! No!

01:21:51.624 --> 01:21:52.750
Blart!

01:21:57.295 --> 01:21:59.024
Don't do it! Blart!

01:22:15.545 --> 01:22:17.137
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:22:31.894 --> 01:22:33.759
Maya! Maya, get inside.

01:22:34.230 --> 01:22:35.788
-Oh, God!
-Dad!

01:22:35.898 --> 01:22:36.956
Paul?

01:22:49.044 --> 01:22:50.807
I really don't drink.

01:22:56.551 --> 01:22:58.917
Come on. Oh, yeah?

01:22:59.988 --> 01:23:01.477
-Dad!
-Come on.

01:23:05.993 --> 01:23:07.051
Dad!

01:23:09.163 --> 01:23:11.256
Man, that hypoglycemia is a killer.

01:23:16.236 --> 01:23:18.396
I told you I'd take you down.

01:23:22.775 --> 01:23:23.901
Blart!

01:23:25.445 --> 01:23:28.414
Very impressive,
taking down an assailant without a gun.

01:23:28.514 --> 01:23:30.982
I hope you don't mind if I use one.

01:23:31.317 --> 01:23:32.375
What?

01:23:36.888 --> 01:23:38.685
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah.

01:23:39.558 --> 01:23:41.549
I guess
it's off to the Cayman lslands then, huh?

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:43.093
Soon as I get my money.

01:23:43.195 --> 01:23:46.824
Yeah, well, you'll be needing this.

01:23:46.932 --> 01:23:48.900
Just give it to him, Dad.

01:23:49.434 --> 01:23:53.164
Oh, I will. Suck on that!

01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:58.534
Okay. Situation update?

01:23:59.210 --> 01:24:01.337
We have seven assailants in custody, sir.

01:24:01.979 --> 01:24:05.005
-Great. Nobody talks to them but me.
-Yes, sir.

01:24:05.116 --> 01:24:07.345
You see, jackass? I don't need the phone.

01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:09.475
'Cause I got all the access codes
written on their arm.

01:24:09.586 --> 01:24:11.713
Now, I kill you three,
there'll be no witnesses.

01:24:11.821 --> 01:24:14.381
And since everybody thinks
this was a bank...

01:24:28.404 --> 01:24:33.341
I got a newsflash for you.
Your flight's been canceled.

01:24:35.411 --> 01:24:37.811
That's better than anything I got.

01:24:45.553 --> 01:24:47.180
You did good, Dad.

01:24:48.689 --> 01:24:50.623
Yeah, I am pretty great.

01:24:54.328 --> 01:24:57.296
You know, she doesn't need a green card.

01:25:39.671 --> 01:25:41.639
I don't know what to say.

01:25:42.207 --> 01:25:44.800
I have something I want to say to you.

01:25:48.445 --> 01:25:50.174
Happy birthday, Amy.

01:26:13.469 --> 01:26:15.266
I heard you applied to be a state trooper.

01:26:15.371 --> 01:26:19.033
You say the word,
my department would be proud to have you.

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:23.510
Thank you, sir. But I think
I'm gonna stick with what I do best.

01:26:24.246 --> 01:26:27.943
It's protecting the people
of the West Orange Pavilion Mall.
