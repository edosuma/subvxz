deserve to die for that?"

a second. A man was murdered.

52:20.853 --> 52:26.197

in that mom's arms."

52:26.197 --> 52:29.119

Gerard should've died.

52:29.119 --> 52:31.457

how painful it gets to be.

a hospitality business, or...

goes to an all-time low.

are taught

to be ashamed
of their vaginas,

doing some misogynistic attack.
