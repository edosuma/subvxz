I hope you'll excuse the mess.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.273
I never bought that business
about a cluttered mind.

09:30.406 --> 09:33.446
Well, a cluttered mind has
a lot of good stuff in it.

09:33.580 --> 09:35.483
These are your artifacts.

09:35.618 --> 09:36.920
My artifacts?

09:37.053 --> 09:38.823
Right, family photos,
old advertisements,

09:38.957 --> 09:40.528
product shots, stuff like that.

09:40.661 --> 09:42.565
Soon as you told me, I had
my assistant start looking.

09:42.698 --> 09:44.034
I hope that's enough.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.807
Your archive, and
yes, that is plenty.

09:46.940 --> 09:48.243
- Thank you.
- I'll have one of

09:48.376 --> 09:50.046
my delivery guys bring it
over to the inn for you.

09:50.179 --> 09:51.181
Okay.

09:51.315 --> 09:52.885
Now, how shall we begin?

09:53.019 --> 09:55.657
I have so many ideas I'd
love to share with you.

09:55.791 --> 09:56.826
Well, Mr. Johnson--

09:56.960 --> 09:58.563
Alton, please.

09:58.697 --> 10:00.300
It was good enough
for my parents.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.972
Alton, look, I know
that this isn't really

10:03.106 --> 10:04.609
a hard-hitting
investigative piece,

10:04.743 --> 10:06.145
but I would like to
approach it the same way

10:06.278 --> 10:07.715
that I do the rest
of my stories,

10:07.848 --> 10:09.786
which means conducting
my own research

10:09.920 --> 10:11.489
and building a rapport
with the interviewees.

10:11.623 --> 10:13.660
So, what you're telling
me is to keep my mouth shut

10:13.793 --> 10:15.062
and stay in my own
lane, is that it?

10:15.196 --> 10:17.200
[Mary chuckles]
I love your enthusiasm.

10:17.334 --> 10:18.837
<i>You don't have to
explain yourself.</i>

10:18.970 --> 10:20.608
This isn't the first
time I've been accused

10:20.741 --> 10:22.277
of being a bit too eager.

10:22.411 --> 10:26.118
The truth is, I'm just very
proud of what we built here.

10:26.252 --> 10:27.822
But you just tell
us what you need,

10:27.955 --> 10:29.225
we're all at your disposal.

10:29.358 --> 10:31.261
- Thank you, so much.
- [glass clanks]

10:31.395 --> 10:33.132
Sorry to bother you, Dad, but
they need you over in shipping.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.336
Blake, wait, I want you
to meet Mary Romero.

10:35.470 --> 10:36.906
<i>She's the
television reporter--</i>

10:37.040 --> 10:38.309
[Blake] <i>Yeah,
I know who she is.</i>

10:39.010 --> 10:40.982
[Mary] <i>Well, so much for
flying under the radar.</i>

10:41.349 --> 10:43.353
Seems like everyone already
knows who I am around here.

10:43.486 --> 10:46.058
Well, your reputation
precedes you.

10:47.962 --> 10:49.866
I'll be in the factory
if you need me.

10:53.005 --> 10:54.876
He did not seem
happy that I'm here.

10:55.009 --> 10:56.780
Oh, he'll come
around eventually.

10:56.913 --> 10:59.552
It's just that my
son wasn't exactly

10:59.685 --> 11:01.155
<i>enthusiastic about this piece.</i>

11:01.288 --> 11:04.161
In fact, to be honest, he
thought it was a bad idea.

11:04.294 --> 11:05.497
Really, why?

11:05.631 --> 11:07.134
[Hank] <i>Oh, he's worried
the story will be</i>

11:07.267 --> 11:10.741
about our success,
our commercial success.

11:10.874 --> 11:12.310
Blake's always
wanted the company

11:12.444 --> 11:13.947
<i>to be about more than
that, but you know what?</i>

11:14.080 --> 11:15.517
<i>Our products
make people happy,</i>

11:15.651 --> 11:17.420
which is something you'll
never hear me apologize for,

11:17.555 --> 11:19.225
and if our customer's
happiness has made us

11:19.358 --> 11:21.896
<i>a commercial success,
then who's fault that?</i>

11:22.030 --> 11:23.365
Well, sounds reasonable to me.

11:23.499 --> 11:26.540
But most importantly,
the Mistletoads.

11:26.673 --> 11:27.842
[Alton chuckles]

11:27.976 --> 11:29.745
Yes, I heard they
were quite popular.

11:29.879 --> 11:31.381
Oh, the kids couldn't
get enough of 'em.

11:31.516 --> 11:32.818
They just loved 'em.

11:32.952 --> 11:33.854
Most did, anyway.

11:33.987 --> 11:35.423
[Alton chuckles]

11:38.029 --> 11:39.799
And we can't have another
drive card expedited,

11:39.932 --> 11:41.102
even shipped overnight?

11:41.603 --> 11:44.140
We can, but we still lose
an entire 12-hour shift.

11:45.578 --> 11:47.013
[Blake sighs]

11:47.146 --> 11:50.120
Okay, let's move production
to Woodbury's plant,

11:50.253 --> 11:51.723
and let's add a night shift.

11:52.290 --> 11:53.727
I'm sure the crew
there will appreciate

11:53.861 --> 11:55.396
the overtime before
the holidays.

11:55.531 --> 11:56.533
I'm on it.

11:56.666 --> 11:58.202
Appreciate you.

12:01.041 --> 12:02.912
Ms. Romero, what
can I do for you?

12:03.045 --> 12:04.949
Were you serious
about my reputation?

12:05.082 --> 12:06.385
- Of course.
- Meaning what?

12:06.519 --> 12:08.456
Meaning, I'm familiar
with your work.

12:08.591 --> 12:09.458
Really?

12:09.592 --> 12:10.894
What specifically?

12:11.028 --> 12:12.531
Well, your piece
on Midwest Chem,

12:12.665 --> 12:14.636
dumping hazardous materials
into the Mississippi.

12:14.769 --> 12:16.606
It was very illuminating.

12:16.740 --> 12:17.942
You saw that?

12:18.677 --> 12:20.514
The Mississippi River
flows into the Iowa.

12:20.647 --> 12:24.021
Iowa flows into the Cedar,
which flows right into town.

12:24.155 --> 12:25.858
I'm sure we're best
known for Johnson Toys,

12:25.991 --> 12:27.929
but we're still a farming
community at heart.

12:28.062 --> 12:30.601
Right. You know, Alton said
you weren't too keen

12:30.735 --> 12:31.737
on talking to me.

12:31.870 --> 12:33.339
Well, I'm sure I can make

12:33.472 --> 12:35.778
a perfectly fine documentary
without my involvement.

12:35.911 --> 12:37.247
Without the grandson
of the founder,

12:37.381 --> 12:38.917
and the one next in line
to inherit the company?

12:39.051 --> 12:40.186
I don't think so.

12:40.319 --> 12:41.856
Sorry, but you're
gonna have to try.

12:41.990 --> 12:43.694
Why don't you wanna
be a part of the story?

12:43.827 --> 12:45.130
With all due respect,

12:45.263 --> 12:46.533
I can already see how
it's gonna turn out.

12:46.667 --> 12:47.969
Really?

12:48.102 --> 12:49.337
That's interesting,
because I'm producing it,

12:49.471 --> 12:51.576
and I don't even know
what the story is.

12:51.709 --> 12:52.845
Trust me.

12:53.613 --> 12:54.849
Indulge me.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.220
I don't know,
maybe something like,

12:58.256 --> 13:00.426
Johnson Toys is the
country's largest

13:00.560 --> 13:03.065
manufacturer of
everything Christmas.

13:03.198 --> 13:04.902
From America's
heartland, they produce

13:05.036 --> 13:07.074
literally thousands of items,

13:07.207 --> 13:10.045
from artificial trees
to advent calendars.

13:10.179 --> 13:12.317
But what they're best known for

13:12.451 --> 13:16.559
are there lovable Christmas
amphibians, the Mistletoads.

13:16.693 --> 13:19.030
Well, you could have
a future in showbiz.

13:19.164 --> 13:20.600
I think I'll leave
that up to you.

13:21.569 --> 13:23.273
Was I close?

13:23.406 --> 13:24.274
[Mary] <i>Sure.</i>

13:24.408 --> 13:25.844
Sure, that's what
my boss wants,

13:25.977 --> 13:27.514
that's probably what
your father wants.

13:27.648 --> 13:31.254
But I bet that there's a lot
more to the story than that.

13:32.357 --> 13:33.425
Okay.

13:33.994 --> 13:35.196
Follow me.

13:37.835 --> 13:41.075
[soft, bright music]

13:41.209 --> 13:45.518
[laughing voices softly echo]

13:45.651 --> 13:46.653
It's beautiful.

13:46.787 --> 13:48.890
My grandpa, Alton Johnson, Sr.

13:49.592 --> 13:51.763
[Mary] <i>Your
grandpa painted this?</i>

13:51.896 --> 13:53.299
<i>It's really good.</i>

13:53.432 --> 13:54.769
[Blake] <i>Yeah, and it
belongs in a museum,</i>

13:54.902 --> 13:56.506
not hanging on
some factory wall.

13:58.544 --> 14:00.012
So, show the world.

14:01.114 --> 14:02.818
Participate in the
story, and you can talk

14:02.951 --> 14:04.622
about your grandpa's
work all you want.

14:04.755 --> 14:05.758
[Blake chuckles]

14:05.892 --> 14:06.993
Think my dad will go for that?

14:07.127 --> 14:08.429
A little trip down memory lane,

14:08.563 --> 14:10.166
instead of the toys
that made him famous?

14:10.801 --> 14:13.506
I think you've got it
wrong how this works.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.913
Nobody has creative
control over my stories.

14:17.046 --> 14:19.952
Over your
advertiser-funded stories?

14:20.086 --> 14:21.556
The only reason I
took this assignment

14:21.690 --> 14:24.427
was because I was
promised creative control.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.066
You're pretty
good at what you do?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.537
I'm very good.

14:28.904 --> 14:31.408
Well, then you'll find a way
to tell the story without me.

14:32.444 --> 14:33.980
I'm gonna get you to say yes.

14:34.114 --> 14:35.951
Nice meeting you, Ms. Romero.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.190
You too, Mr. Johnson.

14:41.295 --> 14:44.568
[soft, bright music]

14:54.856 --> 14:56.125
Hey.

14:56.258 --> 14:57.928
Join me for some
hot chocolate?

14:58.061 --> 14:59.464
Um, no, thank you.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.101
I was just gonna head
out for some dinner.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.538
You know where you're going?

15:02.671 --> 15:04.976
No. No, I think I'm
just gonna walk into town

15:05.110 --> 15:06.445
and see what looks good.

15:06.580 --> 15:08.516
How was your visit
to the factory?

15:08.650 --> 15:10.052
It was interesting.

15:10.186 --> 15:11.923
You get to meet Alton Johnson?

15:12.056 --> 15:13.092
I did.

15:13.226 --> 15:15.096
He is a fascinating man.

15:15.230 --> 15:16.800
He's an amazing man.

15:16.933 --> 15:18.903
<i>They could rename this
town Johnsonville tomorrow,</i>

15:19.037 --> 15:20.472
and no one would complain.

15:20.607 --> 15:22.410
<i>Alton Johnson, Sr.
started the company</i>

15:22.544 --> 15:25.049
<i>in the 40s, right after
he returned from the war.</i>

15:25.182 --> 15:26.919
Back then, Brunswick
was nothing more

15:27.053 --> 15:28.623
than a spit of farmland.

15:28.757 --> 15:30.092
Was your family here then?

15:30.226 --> 15:32.263
You better believe it,
right here in this house.

15:32.397 --> 15:34.401
<i>My great-grandfather
built it himself.</i>

15:34.536 --> 15:37.340
<i>He was one of the first
people to settle here.</i>

15:37.473 --> 15:40.213
He knew Eli Brunswick,
the town's namesake.

15:40.346 --> 15:41.215
[Mary] <i>And the Johnsons?</i>

15:41.348 --> 15:42.785
[Bernice] <i>Of course.</i>

15:42.919 --> 15:44.487
<i>When Junior took over
the business in the 80s,</i>

15:44.622 --> 15:47.160
<i>the Christmas industry
was exploding.</i>

15:47.294 --> 15:49.966
But Alton, he understood
what was happening.

15:50.099 --> 15:52.237
He turned a small
family business

15:52.370 --> 15:55.009
into a multimillion-dollar
enterprise.

15:55.143 --> 15:56.378
Wow.

15:56.512 --> 15:58.550
So, it was good
timing and hard work.

15:58.683 --> 16:00.219
That's not all.

16:01.054 --> 16:02.056
Take a look.

16:02.925 --> 16:04.595
[Bernice] <i>What's it say
on the back?</i>

16:06.966 --> 16:08.035
Made in America?

16:08.168 --> 16:09.572
[Bernice] <i>Exactly.</i>

16:09.939 --> 16:11.308
When Johnson Toys
was expanding,

16:11.442 --> 16:12.978
Alton could have
shipped so much

16:13.112 --> 16:14.648
of the manufacturing overseas.

16:14.782 --> 16:17.187
<i>He could have used foreign
parts, foreign labor.</i>

16:17.320 --> 16:19.825
It would've saved him a
fortune, but he didn't.

16:19.959 --> 16:21.295
He didn't, because it also

16:21.428 --> 16:23.465
would've cost jobs
and hurt the town.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.537
That's the kind of man he is.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.507
Wow.

16:28.744 --> 16:29.778
And Blake?

16:30.647 --> 16:31.783
What about him?

16:31.917 --> 16:34.221
He's a good kid, but he
marches to his own beat.

16:34.354 --> 16:36.960
Yeah, he does seem
a little different.

16:37.093 --> 16:38.630
Different in what way?

16:39.497 --> 16:42.471
Well, certainly his father.

16:43.139 --> 16:46.111
Anyway, thanks for the insight.

16:46.245 --> 16:47.714
Happy to help.

16:49.251 --> 16:50.687
Village Tavern.

16:50.821 --> 16:51.756
Excuse me?

16:51.889 --> 16:53.292
For dinner.

16:53.425 --> 16:55.463
The Village Tavern captures
the spirit of this town,

16:55.597 --> 16:57.768
and has some darn good food.

16:58.604 --> 16:59.805
Thanks.

16:59.939 --> 17:04.213
[jazzy, festive big band music]

17:21.583 --> 17:23.720
What can I get you, ma'am?

17:23.853 --> 17:24.822
What do you recommend?

17:25.422 --> 17:28.195
For you, I'd suggest
a nice chardonnay,

17:28.329 --> 17:29.766
or maybe the Mistletoad.

17:29.899 --> 17:31.201
[Mary chuckles]

17:31.334 --> 17:32.905
I'm almost afraid to
ask, what's a Mistletoad?

17:33.038 --> 17:34.307
It's basically an Appletini,

17:34.441 --> 17:37.180
but we named it after
the Mistletoads.

17:37.815 --> 17:39.986
We're doing a special
for the 40th anniversary.

17:40.855 --> 17:43.593
Actually, I'll have what
Blake Johnson's having.

17:45.429 --> 17:46.799
You like rye, huh?

17:47.735 --> 17:48.402
Sure.

17:49.104 --> 17:55.684
Well, this brand is
distilled right here in Iowa.

17:57.053 --> 17:58.322
On the rocks.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.428
That's Mr. Johnson's drink.

18:06.238 --> 18:07.140
[Mary coughs]

18:07.273 --> 18:08.676
Yeah, that'll warm ya up.

18:10.246 --> 18:11.481
Thanks.

18:13.085 --> 18:15.056
[Lexi] <i>I feel silly
enough for thinking that.</i>

18:15.189 --> 18:16.860
[Blake] <i>No, no, no.</i>

18:16.993 --> 18:18.530
Oh, hi Mary.

18:18.664 --> 18:20.099
- Hi.
- Good to see you again.

18:20.232 --> 18:21.936
So, we're on a
first name basis now?

18:22.069 --> 18:23.372
[playful, bright music]

18:23.507 --> 18:25.043
Let me introduce you
to our VP of Marketing.

18:25.176 --> 18:26.580

have a lot of money back then.

So, that Christmas, he made
the very first Johnson toy,

his newborn son.

were gonna go get food.

Why does everyone in this

know any better,

So, you're gonna want
to rephrase the question

<i>in the answer, so it'll
sound something like,</i>

35:59.951 --> 36:02.790

founded in 1946.</i>

36:02.924 --> 36:04.226
Aye aye, Captain.

Stop, stop, cut.

<i>That Mistletoad,
it's out of focus.</i>

36:10.739 --> 36:14.279
We can't even see what it is,
it looks like a green blob.

36:14.413 --> 36:15.816
It's supposed to
be out of focus.

36:15.949 --> 36:18.087
We want the viewers
to focus on Alton.

36:18.221 --> 36:19.390
Ah, I don't know.

36:19.524 --> 36:21.227
I think we wanna
see the Mistletoads.

<i>After all, they're what we're
known for, not green blobs.</i>

36:24.834 --> 36:26.069

36:40.533 --> 36:41.935
Hey, why do you say that?

36:42.068 --> 36:42.804
What?

36:42.937 --> 36:43.905
Speeding.

36:44.306 --> 36:46.110
It just confirms
that we're recording.

36:46.244 --> 36:48.849

recording or filming?

36:48.982 --> 36:50.218
Alton, if we could just--

36:50.351 --> 36:52.156
It's a relic, really,
from the old days

36:52.289 --> 36:53.859
when you actually used film.

36:53.993 --> 36:55.996
You needed to wait a
few seconds for the film

36:56.130 --> 37:00.005
to reach the proper speed,
so you'd say "speeding."

37:00.138 --> 37:01.273
I love that.

37:01.406 --> 37:02.910

a family business?

Lexi, I cannot have
all these interruptions.

37:22.049 --> 37:24.486
So, I'm gonna ask you if you
need to say something to me

37:24.621 --> 37:27.526
to wait until afterwards,
and if you can't do that,

37:27.660 --> 37:29.496

ask you to leave.

up with the Mistletoads?

that in a little bit?

really like to hear

family business.

Well, this is a
story about family.

up around the house.

37:57.385 --> 37:59.490
I do, too, but she
really loved it.

Anyway, Blake would
smash words together

38:02.129 --> 38:03.899
when he was two or
three, and when he saw

38:04.032 --> 38:07.907
some mistletoe hanging one
day he shouted "Mistletoad!"

maintain integrity like this?

38:55.068 --> 38:56.871
Now, we've worked
together a long time,

38:57.005 --> 38:59.510

to learn about Mary Romero,

38:59.644 --> 39:04.252
is that she brings integrity
into everything she does.

Okay, I'll tell
her to stand down.

48:49.155 --> 48:50.424
Thank you.

48:52.696 --> 48:55.903
So, what happens after you
filmed everything you need?

48:56.838 --> 49:02.114
Hmm, go back to the city
and put it all together.

49:03.117 --> 49:04.553
And that's it.

49:05.254 --> 49:06.423
[Mary] <i>That's it?</i>

49:06.558 --> 49:07.458
[Mary giggles]

49:07.593 --> 49:08.895
That's a lot.

49:09.029 --> 49:11.634
No, I mean that's
it for Brunswick?

49:11.768 --> 49:15.107
[soft, jazzy music]

49:15.240 --> 49:17.478
Yeah, it is.

49:19.015 --> 49:20.552
That's too bad.

49:27.365 --> 49:29.804
You know, I did enjoy it here

49:29.937 --> 49:31.741
a lot more than I
thought I would.

49:31.875 --> 49:33.945
Yeah, no, me too.

49:34.079 --> 49:36.282
I mean, having you here.

49:40.023 --> 49:44.833
And I won't say it wasn't
great getting to know you.

49:45.735 --> 49:51.145
But you have a life and
a job back in Chicago.

49:52.649 --> 49:56.390
And you have an entire
family legacy to continue.

49:56.524 --> 49:57.559
Yeah.

50:00.965 --> 50:02.903
Another time, another place.

50:03.036 --> 50:04.171
Yeah.

50:20.204 --> 50:22.341
[phone beeps]

50:27.919 --> 50:28.888
Hello?

50:29.022 --> 50:30.290
[Brianna] <i>You were asleep?</i>

50:30.424 --> 50:31.794
[Mary] <i>Yeah, I
guess I needed it.</i>

50:31.928 --> 50:34.166
Sounds like the country
life agrees with you.

50:34.299 --> 50:35.535
It was just a late night.

50:35.669 --> 50:36.904
[Brianna] <i>See, I love that.</i>

50:37.038 --> 50:38.140
I love that for you.

50:38.273 --> 50:39.844
<i>Okay, now tell me everything.</i>

50:39.977 --> 50:41.113
How's the toy farmer?

50:41.246 --> 50:42.348
Blake.

50:42.481 --> 50:44.586
[Brianna gasps]
He has a name.

50:44.720 --> 50:46.122
Blake, <i>yes.</i>

50:46.256 --> 50:50.030
Yeah, he's a really great guy.

50:50.164 --> 50:52.970
But I just think
it's bad timing.

50:53.103 --> 50:54.105
Oh, who cares about timing?

50:54.238 --> 50:57.078
I mean, can't he leave Iowa?

50:57.211 --> 50:59.282
No, girl, he's not leaving.

50:59.415 --> 51:01.353
He has roots here.

51:01.486 --> 51:04.425
Would you, gasp, move there?

51:04.560 --> 51:06.163
No, no.

51:06.296 --> 51:07.766
I have spent <i>way too many years</i>

51:07.900 --> 51:09.402
<i>working my way up
that network ladder.</i>

51:09.536 --> 51:11.674
<i>It would be so
stupid to leave now.</i>

51:11.808 --> 51:14.345
And this story is
just so much better

51:14.479 --> 51:15.682
than I ever could
have imagined.

51:15.815 --> 51:17.919
I think I'm just
<i>getting caught up in it.</i>

51:18.053 --> 51:19.455
<i>I think that's all it is.</i>

51:19.590 --> 51:21.894
He's part of the
story, you know?

51:22.027 --> 51:24.967
Mary, what about your story?

51:25.100 --> 51:26.303
[Mary chuckles]

51:26.436 --> 51:27.973
It's just complicated.

51:28.106 --> 51:29.375
Is it?

51:29.510 --> 51:31.413
[Mary chuckles]
How's my bathroom?

51:31.547 --> 51:32.816
[Brianna] <i>It's fine.</i>

51:33.852 --> 51:35.287
I think the guys
left early for lunch,

51:35.421 --> 51:36.590
'cause I was talking too much.

51:36.724 --> 51:38.627
Oh, I'm sure
that's not happening.

51:38.761 --> 51:40.230
Look, I'm coming home tomorrow,

51:40.363 --> 51:43.169
so just call me if
anything explodes, okay?

51:43.303 --> 51:45.408
You'll be the second
person I call, bye.

51:45.542 --> 51:47.211
- [phone beeps]
- Bye.

51:51.186 --> 51:53.189
Okay, I gotta get up.

51:57.365 --> 52:00.237
[bright music]

52:13.598 --> 52:15.167
[Mary] You know what?

52:15.300 --> 52:17.237
I interviewed Alton
behind his desk.

52:17.371 --> 52:19.208
I don't wanna do the
same thing with you.

52:19.342 --> 52:23.885
It's too similar, so I
think we'll put you here.

52:24.018 --> 52:26.089
Okay, whatever you say.

52:26.591 --> 52:28.661
Sorry, Mary, give me a minute.

52:29.228 --> 52:30.565
The colors on the
monitor are off.

52:30.699 --> 52:33.036
Plus, I still need to mic him.

52:33.170 --> 52:34.405
Okay, you know, I can mic him.

52:34.540 --> 52:35.875
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52:36.945 --> 52:37.980
Thanks.

52:38.480 --> 52:40.183
Could you stand up, please?

52:42.322 --> 52:46.129
And I'm gonna go ahead and just
slide this down your shirt.

52:46.263 --> 52:48.333
[soft, tender music]

52:48.467 --> 52:51.239
You can grab it on the bottom.

52:58.955 --> 53:01.693
And you can just put
that in your pocket.

53:05.334 --> 53:06.804
And have a seat.

53:11.748 --> 53:13.150
- All right.
- [camera beeps]

53:13.283 --> 53:14.620
Speeding.

53:14.754 --> 53:16.524
Okay, so just remember
what we talked about.

53:16.657 --> 53:19.763
Look at me, don't look at the
camera, no one-word answers,

53:19.897 --> 53:23.303
and try and rephrase the
question in your answer.

53:23.436 --> 53:25.340
Rephrase, right,
right, got it.

53:25.474 --> 53:27.244
So, why don't we start talking

53:27.377 --> 53:28.981
a little bit about craftsmanship.

53:29.115 --> 53:32.255
Why is craftsmanship so
important to Johnson Toys?

53:33.190 --> 53:36.597
Craftsmanship is important
to Johnson Toys because,

53:38.233 --> 53:39.804
[Blake clears throat]

53:39.937 --> 53:43.878
Craftsmanship is important to
Johnson Toys because, well,

53:46.851 --> 53:48.453
look, I'm sorry, could we start

53:48.588 --> 53:50.024
with something a little easier,

53:50.157 --> 53:52.996
like what do we manufacture,
things like that?

53:53.130 --> 53:54.666
We already got that with Alton,

53:54.800 --> 53:57.004
but it's okay, just relax.

53:57.137 --> 53:58.073
I'm trying.

53:58.207 --> 53:59.743
[Mary giggles]

53:59.877 --> 54:03.718
Pretend that we're at dinner,
just like the other night.

54:04.653 --> 54:08.460
Speak from your heart
and just tell me,

54:09.295 --> 54:11.032
why is craftsmanship
so important?

54:16.142 --> 54:19.081
My grandfather, the
founder of Johnson Toys,

54:19.215 --> 54:23.625
he always said, "Anything worth
doing is worth doing right."

54:23.758 --> 54:25.795
- [Mary giggles]
- [Blake chuckles]

54:25.928 --> 54:28.466
I know, I know, millions of
people say the same thing.

54:28.601 --> 54:30.739
But I don't know
how many of 'em

54:30.872 --> 54:33.109
actually live it, you know?

54:33.544 --> 54:35.515
'Cause to him, craftsmanship

54:35.648 --> 54:37.284
wasn't just about
doing your best work,

54:37.418 --> 54:40.592
it was about
allowing other people

54:40.725 --> 54:43.396
to see the greatness
within themselves.

54:44.734 --> 54:45.902
That was really great, Blake.

54:46.035 --> 54:47.171
[Mary chuckles]

54:47.973 --> 54:52.782
So, Johnson Toys could
manufacture whatever it chooses.

54:52.916 --> 54:55.287
Why focus on Christmas items?

54:55.789 --> 54:58.260
All right, please don't
take this outta context,

54:58.393 --> 55:01.600
but you know what
drives me crazy,

55:01.734 --> 55:05.642
is that for so many people,
it's all about the money.

55:05.775 --> 55:09.583
That's what Christmas
is about, the money.

55:11.587 --> 55:12.722
Not for me.

55:14.693 --> 55:16.162
What's it about for you?

55:17.131 --> 55:20.170
They say Christmas is the
happiest day of the year.

55:20.304 --> 55:25.480
Well, we'd like to bring that
spirit to the other 364 days.

55:25.615 --> 55:26.917
[Mary giggles]

55:28.420 --> 55:29.656
Great.

55:32.494 --> 55:34.098
Ah, there you are.

55:34.232 --> 55:35.167
I was looking all over for you.

55:35.301 --> 55:36.336
Hey.

55:36.469 --> 55:37.739
Everything okay?

55:38.507 --> 55:39.743
Yeah.

55:41.547 --> 55:42.915
Are you not happy
with the interview?

55:43.049 --> 55:45.420
'Cause, I mean, Crash
said I was pretty good.

55:45.555 --> 55:46.857
[Mary giggles]

55:46.990 --> 55:49.730
Oh wow, he was just
being nice, wasn't he?

55:50.163 --> 55:51.734
Crash wouldn't do that.

55:52.301 --> 55:54.438
Okay, then what is it?

55:54.573 --> 55:56.442
You were amazing.

55:57.579 --> 55:59.181
Well, I guess I was just lucky

55:59.315 --> 56:01.319
that I had someone that
could put me at ease.

56:01.754 --> 56:05.493
[soft, jazzy piano music]

56:07.532 --> 56:11.005
Just remember our
deal, all right?

56:11.607 --> 56:12.942
The real story.

56:13.644 --> 56:14.913
Real story.

56:17.653 --> 56:19.054
Look, I hate to throw you out,

56:19.188 --> 56:21.526
but I got some work to do.

56:22.896 --> 56:24.600
Maybe if you're free later,

56:24.733 --> 56:28.473
we could get some dinner,
just to say goodbye?

56:29.375 --> 56:31.045
I think I can fit you in.

56:32.248 --> 56:33.884
- Okay.
- Sure.

See ya.

56:39.028 --> 56:40.463
[Mary sighs]

56:42.803 --> 56:44.973
[Crash] Sure you don't wanna
ride back to the inn?

56:45.407 --> 56:46.944
Nah, I feel like walking.

56:47.512 --> 56:48.814
[Crash] You know,
I had my doubts

56:48.948 --> 56:50.685
about all this,
just like you did.

56:50.818 --> 56:53.023
But the truth is, it's turning
out to be a nice piece.

Get outta here.

know my name here.

Aw, you're gonna miss
our small town hospitality.

58:41.472 --> 58:42.776
I am.

Speaking of which, how's
Bernice treating you?

She's so sweet, I
want her to adopt me.

[Mary giggles]

58:49.823 --> 58:51.459
Oh, looks like we're ready.

58:52.294 --> 58:53.998
So, my next piece is
on the Transit Authority

58:54.131 --> 58:55.601
and how the bidding process

58:55.734 --> 58:57.037
is not transparent
to the public.

58:57.170 --> 58:58.373
Sure.

58:58.507 --> 58:59.576
So, this makes for
potentially criminal behavior,

58:59.709 --> 59:00.945
and even if it doesn't,

59:01.078 --> 59:02.615
it foments distrust
of the government.

59:02.749 --> 59:05.020
Wow, that sounds
like quite the expose.

59:05.153 --> 59:06.891
It's important
for people to see.

59:07.024 --> 59:08.627
Making a difference, right?

59:08.761 --> 59:10.030
That's right.

59:10.632 --> 59:11.867

must have gone well,

59:18.413 --> 59:19.749
It was fine.

59:20.652 --> 59:21.954
I recall you using the words,

ago, we're wrapped.

you're taking the story.

But that is the
real story, okay?

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.250
It's an artist who sacrifices
his dream to save a small town

01:08:47.384 --> 01:08:50.557
and then becomes one of the
biggest employers in the state.

Phil start a new cut.

01:08:52.861 --> 01:08:55.066
Hank, you promised
me creative control.

01:08:55.199 --> 01:08:57.938

with the Christmas paintings,

01:08:58.072 --> 01:08:59.609

something to inherit.

But you missed the brief.

You were supposed to be
there for the Mistletoads.

01:09:05.453 --> 01:09:07.925
This story is actually
very important to me,

01:09:08.059 --> 01:09:10.564
and I made promises to the
people who participated.

01:09:10.697 --> 01:09:12.167

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:13.637
I've got bosses,
too, and right now,

01:09:13.771 --> 01:09:15.741
they're more concerned
with the bottom line.

01:09:16.543 --> 01:09:17.945
I gave them my word.

01:09:20.651 --> 01:09:22.187
It's not gonna be that bad.
