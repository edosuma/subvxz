00:01.040 --> 00:03.840
The only way to do our job...
expose corruption...

00:03.840 --> 00:05.560
is get someone on the inside.

00:05.560 --> 00:09.040
I met a couple of blokes out here,
detectives,

00:09.040 --> 00:11.680
and we're thinking of going
into business for ourselves...

00:11.680 --> 00:13.000
your old business.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.600
GERRY: This kind of surveillance work
can be dangerous.

00:15.600 --> 00:16.800
I'll do it.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.320
EDDIE: Joe Dooley's gone.
He's doing the D's course.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.240
TREVOR: What?
Detective Joe Dickhead?

00:22.240 --> 00:23.800
AGIUS: In light of that recording,

00:23.800 --> 00:26.880
do you wish to alter your
previous statements in any way?

00:26.880 --> 00:29.480
There's a rumour going round
someone's dogged us already.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.320
If I find out one of us is dogging,

00:31.320 --> 00:33.200
they'll end up with
a bullet in their head.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.080
We'll relocate, yep, but it's
gonna be without you, Trevor.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.200
I want you to look me in the eye

00:38.200 --> 00:40.720
and swear that when
you get on that stand,

00:40.720 --> 00:42.711
you will not make me a liar.

SONG: # It's a jungle out there

01:03.360 --> 01:05.635
# It's a jungle out there

01:24.120 --> 01:26.156
# It's a jungle out there. #

01:54.400 --> 01:56.040
You right?

01:56.040 --> 01:58.480
Yeah, I'm just jumpy.
Don't like waiting.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.920
I was supposed to hook up with Jimbo
this morning, but he pulled out.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.275
Straightaway I'm thinking,
"What's wrong?"

02:06.800 --> 02:08.392
Here.

02:10.759 --> 02:12.239
What?

02:13.400 --> 02:15.038
We gotta talk, mate.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.920
The boys are suss.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.200
They don't want you doing
the pick-ups anymore.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.440
What? Have you heard something?
Yeah, I heard a lot, mate.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.680
I'm just trying to work out
how much of it's true.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.440
Are you talking about
the royal commission?

02:27.440 --> 02:29.280
Jesus. Are they about to pick me up?

02:29.280 --> 02:32.480
Look, do you think I would be here
if they were about to pick you up?

02:32.480 --> 02:34.640
You... Look...

02:34.640 --> 02:37.520
You're just a bit hot
at the moment. That's all.

02:37.520 --> 02:41.200
Changing the pick-up arrangements
is just a bloody precaution.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.600
I'm going nuts here, mate,
bloody paranoid.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.319
As far as this goes, I'd rather
see the back of it anyway.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.437
MAN: And bing.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.479
We got him.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.160
Haken's doing good work.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.840
I swear to God, if it
wasn't against regulations,

03:01.840 --> 03:03.432
I'd nominate Trevor for an Oscar.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.840
EDDIE: So? What did he say?

03:18.840 --> 03:20.960
I've told ya Trevor's solid.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.560
Yeah?
Yep.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.640
Well, Captain Jack saw him
getting out of a van

03:24.640 --> 03:26.200
with black tinted windows.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.480
Tinted windows? Oh, well,
must be the Feds, then.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.560
I mean, who else has tinting, hey?

03:32.560 --> 03:34.240
Bill Bayeh reckons he's suss

03:34.240 --> 03:36.160
and that prick
usually knows what's what.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.680
Yeah, well, fuck Bill Bayeh.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.800
Look, I've been a cop for 20 years.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.280
I think I can tell when a bloke's
lying or not, alright?

03:43.280 --> 03:46.720
Chook, the last time I saw Trevor,
he was acting bloody weird.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.160
He's shitting himself, Jim.

03:49.160 --> 03:53.312
Now, if that makes a bloke a dog,
I'll buy you a kennel right now.

03:57.840 --> 04:01.160
Now, just so no-one else
is pissing in their pants,

04:01.160 --> 04:03.280
I told Trevor to hand over
the pick-ups.

04:03.280 --> 04:06.840
Oh, yeah? Who's gonna do them?

04:06.840 --> 04:10.800
Oh, no, mate. Since you and Chook
are gone, I've been snowed under.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.680
Mate, Jimmy Egan sleeps at his desk.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.440
Mate, the rest of them,
they're just kids.

04:16.440 --> 04:17.920
Yeah, I know, mate.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.320
You're the only one still
working the Cross who's got a clue.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.160
Oh, mate, to top it off,
Sarah's got the gastro

04:23.160 --> 04:25.040
and little Bobby's
being potty trained.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.400
I tell you what, he's not exactly
a natural, you know?

04:27.400 --> 04:28.880
Pissing all over the place.

04:28.880 --> 04:32.040
Yeah, I got kids. I've been there.
It's tiring.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.400
But look, Scull, this thing
with the pick-ups, right,

04:34.400 --> 04:36.320
it's only gonna be
for a couple of weeks.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.480
Help us out, hey?

04:38.480 --> 04:41.631
Yeah, alright, mate.
You tell Billy we're on.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.920
We put Chook Fowler
and Neville Scullion on the stand,

04:44.920 --> 04:46.760
they will both swear
on a stack of Bibles

04:46.760 --> 04:48.400
they have never taken a cent.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.960
And then we wheel out Louis Bayeh

04:49.960 --> 04:51.960
and he names them both
as being on the take.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.480
Trevor Haken, Fowler, everyone...
they all get paid.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.960
They get paid plenty money...

04:55.960 --> 04:59.160
$12,000 every week
they come collect.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.960
AGIUS: I've been working with him
on his testimony.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.440
Louis is coming across
as almost credible.

05:02.440 --> 05:03.920
Both Fowler and Scullion

05:03.920 --> 05:06.080
know they're facing perjury charges
if the other one flips.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.840
If either one of them
loses his nerve,

05:07.840 --> 05:10.080
we smash Kings Cross wide open.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.040
GERRY: And we've still got
Haken up our sleeve.

05:12.040 --> 05:15.237
He's still covert,
still gathering evidence.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.276
Neville Scullion.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.920
You are hereby served.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.115
Have a nice day.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.640
What's the bloody emergency?

05:58.640 --> 06:02.280
I have been summonsed to testify.

06:02.280 --> 06:05.120
So you come down here
to tell me the news?

06:05.120 --> 06:07.240
I am shitting myself.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.120
Mate, I've been doing
the pick-ups for Trevor.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.840
And I am no good in court.
I'd get rattled in the stand.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.559
You know that.
Pull yourself together, Scully.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.197
Come on over here, mate.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.512
When are you on?

06:23.560 --> 06:26.520
The 15th, next Thursday arvo.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.680
Right. Well, I'm on Thursday morning.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.200
After I leave, I'll tell them
to go easy on you, alright?

06:31.200 --> 06:34.560
You've been summonsed too? Why
didn't you give me the call on that?

06:34.560 --> 06:37.160
Scully, when they summons ya,
they watch ya.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.880
Now, if I come running
straight to you,

06:38.880 --> 06:40.313
then that puts you in their sights.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.920
And vice versa.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.720
Oh, shit. I... Sorry.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.200
Chook, I didn't...

06:48.200 --> 06:50.240
Spilt milk, mate.
I'm sorry.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.280
Look, I'm up first, OK?

06:52.280 --> 06:54.440
You do what I do
and you follow my lead,

06:54.440 --> 06:56.040
we'll both be fine, alright?

06:56.040 --> 06:59.350
And we'll face these bastards
down together, alright?

07:00.400 --> 07:02.760
RALPH GRIFFIN: Corruption
is a team sport, believe me,

07:02.760 --> 07:04.560
so finding out who
Eddie Gould's accomplices are

07:04.560 --> 07:06.240
is our second objective.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.240
And what's our first objective?
Getting him back here.

07:08.240 --> 07:11.520
This is where we'll get our best
results in terms of surveillance.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.800
So where are the cameras exactly?
Oh, all around.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.800
It's probably best you don't
know exactly where they are

07:15.800 --> 07:17.358
'cause you tend to play to them.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.960
So basically I'm just meant
to get on with my life,

07:20.960 --> 07:22.960
not knowing whether or not
you're watching me?

07:22.960 --> 07:26.920
Relax. After a while, you'll
barely even know they're there.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.878
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYS)

07:32.120 --> 07:35.920
I like her,
the one with the big titties.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.717
Krystal?

07:38.760 --> 07:40.360
She doesn't do sex.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.760
She's certainly not shy
about putting it out there.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.600
She's a stripper. It's her job.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.320
Look, I don't want scrubbers.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.520
I run a knock shop,
I want my merchandise

07:49.520 --> 07:51.033
to be top-quality, like her.

07:52.760 --> 07:56.320
Put your money on the table, then.
She'll be big bucks.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.280
The money's a bit
tied up at the moment.

07:58.280 --> 08:01.000
It's bloody expensive
setting up a brothel.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.680
What about the investors?
Tap them on the shoulder.

08:03.680 --> 08:07.116
Oh, I'm tapping.
You just gotta be patient.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.910
How about I talk to them, hm?

08:12.440 --> 08:14.158
I can be pretty convincing.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.399
I bet you can.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.520
JACQUI JAMES: With a major
investigation looming,

08:21.520 --> 08:23.360
a rational person might think

08:23.360 --> 08:26.280
that things in the Cross
would've quietened down,

08:26.280 --> 08:29.200
but for most of the key players
on the Golden Mile,

08:29.200 --> 08:31.440
rationality didn't come into it.

08:31.440 --> 08:35.600
Billy Bayeh was a man
with a serious gambling habit

08:35.600 --> 08:38.520
and the more pressure he felt,
the more he gambled.

08:38.520 --> 08:43.039
So for Bill, winding back
his operation wasn't an option.

08:43.039 --> 08:44.640
Across the road,

08:44.640 --> 08:47.920
Danny 'DK' Karam had his own
habits to feed.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.680
They included steroids,
heroin, cocaine,

08:50.680 --> 08:53.640
even marijuana
just to take the edge off.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.840
And lately he'd found himself
a snorting partner

08:55.840 --> 08:58.479
just as irrational as he was.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.349
Harry 'Hammer' Hammoud.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.640
That's not to say there weren't any
clear heads in the Cross.

09:10.640 --> 09:15.120
They just had the good sense
to keep a slightly lower profile.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.040
Listen, I need money.
What? You want a loan?

09:17.040 --> 09:18.920
A loan? No, I don't want a loan.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.800
I don't know, mate.
You asked for money.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.360
Billy owes us for next week.
I'll take my cut of that.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.640
Billy's paid so I don't know
if I can do that.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.631
Well, you can pay us
for next week in advance.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.160
We've got a good thing
going with Billy.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.000
Listen, Hammer, I know
you're living day-to-day,

09:33.000 --> 09:34.520
but what about all the other days?

09:34.520 --> 09:36.000
Don't you wanna make them better?

09:36.000 --> 09:39.760
Billy uses us. Billy would
be nothing without us.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.433
He'd be nothing without me.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.200
DK: You take
your fucking hand off it!

09:50.200 --> 09:51.920
Stand back, Danny. Stand down.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.520
Leave my fucking plates!
Joe! Joe, come here.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.960
Hey. Danny, Danny, calm down.
Tell me what the problem is.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.960
The car is unregistered. It's got
half a dozen warrants against it.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.000
Pickles was taking off the plates.
(CURSES IN ARABIC)

10:03.000 --> 10:04.877
OK, OK, OK.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.679
What the fuck are you doing, Dooley?

10:12.880 --> 10:14.632
What the fuck
are you doing, Dooley?!

10:16.400 --> 10:18.640
You piece of shit.
Think about what you're doing.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.880
You slimy piece of shit.
I kill you. I kill you.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.920
Danny, I would stand back
if I were you.

10:22.920 --> 10:26.360
Because if you don't, I will arrest you
for threatening a police officer.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.952
Alright?!

10:32.200 --> 10:34.400
Danny, if you drive
an unregistered vehicle...

10:34.400 --> 10:36.516
JOE: Let it go. He'll keep.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.630
(ENGINE STARTS)

10:46.760 --> 10:49.800
I would like to conclude
the preliminary proceedings

10:49.800 --> 10:51.916
with a final warning.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.120
Tomorrow we will begin
taking formal evidence.

10:56.120 --> 10:59.760
If you are a police officer
who is engaged in corrupt activity

10:59.760 --> 11:02.480
and these activities
are exposed by this commission,

11:02.480 --> 11:07.200
you ought to understand
the consequences will be very grave.

11:07.200 --> 11:12.080
For those who acknowledge wrongdoing,
things may go easier,

11:12.080 --> 11:13.960
but for those who choose
not to cooperate,

11:13.960 --> 11:16.240
the consequences will be severe

11:16.240 --> 11:21.712
and will impact not only on you,
but on your whole family.

11:25.160 --> 11:28.440
I'm fucked. They're onto me.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.600
No, mate. If they had
anything solid, they'd move.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.240
They have moved.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.280
They're busting me
down to uniform. Me!

11:35.280 --> 11:39.080
That's a vote of no confidence,
that is, Trev. That's a big bloody vote.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.040
You reckon it's connected
to the commission?

11:41.040 --> 11:42.520
I've gotta get out, mate.

11:42.520 --> 11:45.400
I've gotta get out of testifying,
I have to get out of the job.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.880
I've gotta go
while the going's good.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.760
Hurt on duty, go for stress.

11:48.760 --> 11:52.480
No stress. None of that bullshit.
No, I need a nasty proper accident.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.200
Now, I'm thinking about
the lobby at work.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.440
The floor's made out of granite
or some bloody thing.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.000
Yeah, it's slippery as buggery.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.360
So I spill something on there,
like a milkshake or something,

12:01.360 --> 12:02.840
and I go for six.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.440
Then you're out.
Yeah.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.760
But no bastard hears about this,
Trevor, alright, or I'm fucked.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.000
Not Egan, not Scully, no-one.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.513
Nup.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.594
Fucking arseholes.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.680
SEAN: Look, you know I wanna
help you out, mate.

12:20.680 --> 12:24.355
It's just the way things are
right now, it's bloody tricky.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.200
I looked after you. Hey?

12:28.200 --> 12:30.240
I set you up, son.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.640
I know, I know, it's just...

12:32.640 --> 12:34.835
I've been trying
to keep my head down.

12:36.640 --> 12:41.560
So when things were good,
you were keen to be my mate,

12:41.560 --> 12:44.440
but now things are a bit tough,
it's like, "Oh, bugger Chook.

12:44.440 --> 12:48.280
"Stuff him, hey? Let him sink."

12:48.280 --> 12:50.077
Looking after number one, is that it?

12:51.840 --> 12:54.600
Is that it?
No, no. Of course it's not.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.560
Oh! Arggh!

14:16.560 --> 14:19.120
Call an ambulance, buddy.
I think he's hit his head.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.800
You right, mate?
Christ, this floor's hard, mate.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.560
Shh, shh, shh.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.560
Hey, how you doing?
How you doing, mate?

14:30.560 --> 14:35.480
Prescription on here says 'T ake as often
as you want with ice until unconscious'.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.320
Good on you. Thanks, fellas.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.800
EDDIE: Chookie.
Yes, mate.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.712
This thing here, is this permanent?

14:44.400 --> 14:48.200
Edward, go and get us some glasses

14:48.200 --> 14:50.800
before I hit you
on the head with this.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.240
Righto.
(LAUGHS)

a bad time to go out.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.200
Twist of fate, Jimbo, you know?

15:01.200 --> 15:04.160
I mean, I reckon I had years
of service left to offer,

15:04.160 --> 15:07.470
but the gods have spoken, so...

15:09.120 --> 15:10.720
(SCOFFS)
What's wrong with you?

15:10.720 --> 15:13.280
Look like they sat you
in a used bedpan.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.600
A bit nervous, you know?

15:16.600 --> 15:18.800
I'm up tomorrow at the commission.

15:18.800 --> 15:19.800
(POURS A DRINK)

15:19.800 --> 15:22.160
Yeah, well, you know
I'd be there if I could, Scully,

15:22.160 --> 15:24.515
but like I said, mate, twist of fate.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.710
Thanks, son.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.680
Hey, listen, mate.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.920
There's something I gotta tell ya.
Hmm?

15:35.920 --> 15:39.080
When you've been a detective around
this place for as long as I have,

15:39.080 --> 15:41.120
you, you know,
overhear certain things

15:41.120 --> 15:44.680
that you might not, you know,
necessarily otherwise overhear.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.320
Well, let me guess.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.356
Eddie Gould's a cross-dresser?

15:50.600 --> 15:53.194
I hear Danny Karam has been
looking for your home address.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.960
Shit.
Now, we can fix this, right?

15:56.960 --> 15:59.360
Jim and Eddie, they'll load
that prick up with enough smack

15:59.360 --> 16:01.271
to put him away for 5 to 10.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.600
No, I don't want to do that.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.520
But you don't have to do anything.
Jim and Eddie will do it.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.512
I don't want them doing it either.
(STAMMERS)

16:16.080 --> 16:18.720
Alright. (SIGHS)

16:18.720 --> 16:20.960
I'II, you know,
I'll wise up the uniform boys.

16:20.960 --> 16:24.000
We'll get them to look out for DK.
Thanks, Scull.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.480
Just do us a favour, yeah?

16:25.480 --> 16:28.313
From now on,
you take your firearm home.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.240
What's this in aid of?

16:41.240 --> 16:45.080
The old locks...
they were, uh, museum pieces.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.513
I thought it was time we updated.

16:47.760 --> 16:51.240
Mm-hm. Should I be worried?

16:51.240 --> 16:54.240
No. Why would you be worried?
Has something happened?

16:54.240 --> 16:59.040
Well, yes. This has happened... you
acting weird like something's wrong.

16:59.040 --> 17:02.520
Ellie, come on. Everything is fine.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.720
Just, you know,
we're getting married.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.517
I guess...

17:07.720 --> 17:10.358
...I should be looking
after you properly, huh?

17:15.920 --> 17:19.070
Off you go.
OK.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.671
G'day, Danny.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.840
You following me all day?

17:35.840 --> 17:39.719
No. We got a tip that people use
this premises for injecting drugs.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.880
Joe fucking Dooley sent you.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.720
No-one sent me.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.400
But you remember... we're all cops.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.473
As far as I'm concerned,
it's touch one, touch all.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.640
(BANGING AT DOOR)
OK!

17:58.640 --> 18:00.756

Hammer. Hey, mate,
we're not open yet.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.598
Come in. Have a drink.

18:10.800 --> 18:14.280
What are you doing? What are
you doing, you stupid fuck?!

18:14.280 --> 18:15.998
You're supposed
to look after this place!

18:18.600 --> 18:20.636
Take it up with Johnny.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.880
HAMMER: I told you I was
gonna get a cash advance.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.960
And I told you we're running
a business here.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.440
So what?

18:28.440 --> 18:32.120
Yeah, a security business, mate,
and Billy's a customer.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.760
This type of shit hurts us.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.320
(GRUNTS)

18:35.320 --> 18:38.000
What's he gonna do if I don't
deliver, huh? He's gonna sack us?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
It hurts my rep, mate.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.878
The only rep you got
is hanging behind me.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.840
Come on! You want a go?

18:46.840 --> 18:50.080
Come on, mate. Huh?
Relax, relax!

18:50.080 --> 18:51.840
The only brains you have
are mine, bitch!

18:51.840 --> 18:53.560
(MEN YELL AND JOSTLE)

18:53.560 --> 18:55.760
Come on! Come here! Huh?

18:55.760 --> 18:57.990
Come on, boys.
Fuck!

19:08.080 --> 19:10.878
Hey, bro! Bro!

19:12.000 --> 19:13.640
You're Hammer, yeah?

19:13.640 --> 19:15.800
I'm Doc. I'm looking for work.
Work?

19:15.800 --> 19:18.160
No, listen. I can do stuff for you.
Stuff?

19:18.160 --> 19:19.840
Old prick back there,
Mr Blow-Wave...

19:19.840 --> 19:21.800
That prick is the smartest
operator in the Cross.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.680
Won't be smart
with a knife in his balls.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.720
If I ever fucking see you around
here again, I'm gonna kill you.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.960
Do you understand?
I'm gonna kill you. Alright?

19:28.960 --> 19:32.000
Now get the fuck out of here.
Get out of here!

19:32.000 --> 19:34.070
Get out of here. Get the...

19:49.640 --> 19:53.080
Why a little boy
like you want a gun?

19:53.080 --> 19:56.993
A tough guy pushed me round.
I'm gonna shoot him.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.560
You got cash?

20:01.560 --> 20:03.240
A grand.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.595
Hey, hey!
Relax!

20:07.240 --> 20:09.440
You want a gun?

20:09.440 --> 20:11.431
I need cash.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.439
Meet me here tomorrow, same time.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.311
You get what you want.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.077
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

20:30.160 --> 20:33.516
Well, well, well!
Don't you look the part?

20:35.080 --> 20:36.680
Nice place.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.720
Actually, it's a shit hole, but it's
not bad for what you're earning.

20:39.720 --> 20:42.240
I'm late for work, Eddie.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.320
Well, you're the one that's always
asking me to come around.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.311
Well, here I am.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.280
Is something wrong?

20:50.280 --> 20:53.750
There is, actually.
We've got money issues.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.440
I was thinking you might wanna
go back on the job for a minute.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.280
What?
You know, a bit of hooking.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.880
I'm a cop.

21:02.880 --> 21:06.160
Come on! You're a hooker
playing at being a cop.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.912
Oh, fuck you.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.000
I'm trying to help you here.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Unless you wanna be living
in shitty places like this

21:17.000 --> 21:19.040
for the next 10 years,

21:19.040 --> 21:21.880
you ought to think about
lending me a hand.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.950
Hey?

21:27.040 --> 21:28.871
I'll let myself out.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.680
AGIUS: Mr Scullion,
do you know Benjamin Kassab,

21:44.680 --> 21:46.920
usually called Benny Kassab?

21:46.920 --> 21:49.434
SCULLY: I do.
How would you describe him?

21:51.040 --> 21:53.240
In my opinion, he's a drug dealer.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.560
A drug dealer now facing
serious charges,

21:55.560 --> 21:57.880
but not as a result
of any action taken by you.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.440
Action without evidence
doesn't count for much in court,

22:01.440 --> 22:03.396
at least not in a real court.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.760
Prior to Kassab's arrest,

22:07.760 --> 22:10.840
did he ever offer you any money to
turn a blind eye to his activities?

22:10.840 --> 22:12.440
Never.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.080
Have you ever been offered money

22:14.080 --> 22:16.320
by a person engaged
in criminal activity,

22:16.320 --> 22:18.640
whether they were
urinating behind the fountain

22:18.640 --> 22:20.920
or dealing hard drugs?

22:20.920 --> 22:22.600
I have not.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.876
Do you think that's the general
experience of your colleagues?

22:27.280 --> 22:30.600
I am certain that it is.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.558
(SNORES)

22:37.840 --> 22:39.680
Mr Fowler.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.400
(GRUNTS)

22:41.400 --> 22:43.595
I have a warrant for your arrest.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.120
What?
You're in contempt, Mr Fowler.

22:48.120 --> 22:52.400
"Refusing to answer a summons
to appear before the commission."

22:52.400 --> 22:55.680
No, no. I'm... I'm injured.

22:55.680 --> 22:58.240
I, uh, sent in a medical certificate.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.276
Which the Commissioner rejected.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.320
I'll have the police union on you.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.629
Uh, look.

23:08.040 --> 23:12.840
The Commissioner says that I should
defer executing this until tomorrow.

23:12.840 --> 23:14.400
Now, the nurses tell me

23:14.400 --> 23:16.440
that they're discharging you
in the morning,

23:16.440 --> 23:21.440
so you could just
pop on over and, um, see us.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.989
You know, on your way home.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.750
Or I could come over and arrest ya.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.672
Your choice.

23:42.120 --> 23:45.240
Mr Fowler, how would you
react if I told you

23:45.240 --> 23:46.920
that we had compelling evidence

23:46.920 --> 23:50.000
that large-scale drug distribution
took place in the Cross

23:50.000 --> 23:52.520
during the time that you were
chief of detectives there?

23:52.520 --> 23:55.400
Well, I'd be surprised
if you hadn't found that.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.120
I knew about it myself.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.800
But knowing about it
and making arrests,

23:59.800 --> 24:01.440
that's two different things.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.680
So you would deny
that drug dealing thrived

24:03.680 --> 24:05.750
as a result of your
knowing connivance?

24:06.800 --> 24:08.995
That suggestion's a slander.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.160
And you've never been
involved in any way

24:13.160 --> 24:14.840
with the collection or distribution

24:14.840 --> 24:16.480
of corrupt monies
paid by drug dealers?

24:16.480 --> 24:18.520
I have not.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.640
Corruption and you were
complete strangers, in other words?

24:20.640 --> 24:22.400
That's correct.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.640
You haven't had any relationship
with your police colleagues

24:24.640 --> 24:27.840
where they might pass money on to you
for any purpose?

24:27.840 --> 24:29.720
I have not.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.160
Detective Scullion, for example...
has there ever been an occasion

24:32.160 --> 24:34.320
where he's paid you
a substantial sum of money?

24:34.320 --> 24:35.800
No, there has not.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.280
Detective Sergeant Trevor Haken...
the same again?

24:38.280 --> 24:40.160
Yeah, I've already told you,
the answer's no.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.480
And your injury...
a fall outside the lift at work...

24:42.480 --> 24:44.118
that must have come as quite a shock.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.920
Well, yes, obviously.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.320
And is it causing you
quite a deal of pain?

24:50.320 --> 24:52.560
Yes, it is.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.440
Well, then maybe
we should allow Mr Fowler

24:54.440 --> 24:56.120
to return to his recuperation.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.917
I have no further questions.

25:10.600 --> 25:14.080
I swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth,

25:14.080 --> 25:16.036
so help me God.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.840
AGIUS: Mr Bayeh, I'd like to start
by asking you some questions

25:23.840 --> 25:25.960
concerning corrupt payments
you've made

25:25.960 --> 25:27.678
to police officers
in the Kings Cross area.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.796
I can't answer no question today.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.840
I beg your pardon?
I am crook. I no sleep.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.320
I... I no sleep.

25:41.320 --> 25:42.800
Mr Bayeh, in this hearing room,

25:42.800 --> 25:44.840
you must answer
all questions put to you

25:44.840 --> 25:46.920
or face contempt proceedings.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.400
Well, you may say
that you object to answering

25:49.400 --> 25:51.120
and if you choose to do that,

25:51.120 --> 25:53.600
the answers you give
cannot be used against you

25:53.600 --> 25:56.520
unless, of course, your evidence
is false or misleading.

25:56.520 --> 25:59.240
Would such a choice
help to put you at ease?

25:59.240 --> 26:00.800
Yes.

26:00.800 --> 26:04.600
Because I no sleep. I'm crook.
I've got bad headache.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.560
AGIUS: Mr Bayeh, once more,
the objection protects you

26:06.560 --> 26:08.040
in that the answers you give

26:08.040 --> 26:09.960
may not be used against you
in other proceedings.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.240
It does not excuse you
from answering.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.673
Mm.

26:21.720 --> 26:24.920
I've got nothing to hide.
I'll tell you everything.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.480
But there's been a contract now

26:26.480 --> 26:28.880

from NSW Police.

they kill me. I get killed.

WOOD: Are you aware of this claim,
Mr Agius?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.520
Until two minutes ago,
it was my understanding

26:37.520 --> 26:39.720
that Mr Bayeh was eager
to answer our questions,

26:39.720 --> 26:41.720
notwithstanding his headache.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.680
Well, in the light of
Mr Bayeh's allegation,

26:44.680 --> 26:48.280
I feel inclined to stand over
further evidence from this witness

26:48.280 --> 26:50.510
until we can ensure his safety.

He thinks he can fuck with me.

Now I fuck him.
He's a cop.

(CHUCKLES) Nah, I've been building
this for over a year now, mate.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.520
I started building it for the kids,

29:41.520 --> 29:44.120
but they're probably getting
a bit old for it now.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.720

it's hard to keep track.

you're working for your family

even bloody know them.

calling you back, the commission.

Well, I haven't
been summonsed yet, so...

30:19.080 --> 30:20.760
No, I'm not talking about that, mate.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.557
It's, uh...

30:23.600 --> 30:26.910
...this holiday that Maria's gone on.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.680
She's obviously taken the kids, yeah?

30:31.680 --> 30:33.750
Yeah, yeah, she has.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.800
Mate, we all knew that you
were having trouble at home,

30:37.800 --> 30:42.840
but I don't reckon we made it
any easier for... for you.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.195

I'm not supposed
to discuss that, sir.

about operational details.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.280
What concerns us

33:23.280 --> 33:26.397

attention in the first place.

Sir?

33:31.320 --> 33:33.436
I understand you used
to work as a prostitute.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.080
Yes, that's correct.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.960
Yet in your police application form,

33:39.960 --> 33:42.474
you've made no mention
of prostitution.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.960
It said to put down
my last three jobs.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.800
It says your last job and the three
before that... four in total.

33:49.800 --> 33:53.320
You've listed three
and one of those is "TAFE student",

33:53.320 --> 33:55.914
which is not an employment.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.400
I guess I misread the form.

declaration in a signed statement.

What I'd like you to remember
is that this video

unduly, Mr Fowler,

deeply involved in corruption.

But now those days are over.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.560
Mr Scullion, when you previously
gave evidence before the commission,

40:21.560 --> 40:23.840
you were not able to provide
any information or evidence

40:23.840 --> 40:25.831
concerning police corruption.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.680
That's correct.

Yes, it is.

in corrupt practices
at Kings Cross Detectives.

40:57.040 --> 41:01.909
I've picked up money,
I've distributed money.

41:05.080 --> 41:07.150
I've turned a blind eye.

41:16.480 --> 41:18.311
I'm crook.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.830
I'm a crook cop.

41:48.020 --> 41:50.660
Well, here's to
Inspector Chook Fowler.

41:50.660 --> 41:52.890
He was a loyal mate.

41:53.940 --> 41:55.860
And a fair boss.

41:55.860 --> 41:59.940
EDDIE: And a bloody good cop who
knows how to keep his mouth shut,

41:59.940 --> 42:02.300
unlike some other maggots
we could name and choose not to.

42:02.300 --> 42:03.813
May they rot in hell.

42:05.660 --> 42:07.093
Here's to it.

42:12.100 --> 42:14.060
I heard DK was up this arvo.

42:14.060 --> 42:17.500
Yeah, he got done for the assault
charge, acquitted on the firearms.

42:17.500 --> 42:20.173
Six months.
He'll be back in three?

42:21.220 --> 42:24.451
Yep. That's the system.

42:25.500 --> 42:28.460
Those blokes had their own system.

42:28.460 --> 42:30.257
It wasn't perfect,
but it got results.

42:35.620 --> 42:38.578
(PEOPLE CHATTER)

42:52.900 --> 42:55.540
So, big win today, mate,
flipping Scullion.

42:55.540 --> 42:58.860
(CLEARS THROAT)
Trevor, um, these drinks,

42:58.860 --> 43:00.780
they're for the investigative team.

43:00.780 --> 43:02.780
Yeah, yeah, sure. I understand that.

43:02.780 --> 43:04.780
So the Commissioner
would like you to leave.

43:04.780 --> 43:06.260
What?

43:06.260 --> 43:09.260
But I've been part of this
investigation for six months.

43:09.260 --> 43:13.220
But you're not part of the team,
are you? You're an informer.

43:13.220 --> 43:15.540
I'm a detective,
a detective bloody sergeant!

43:15.540 --> 43:18.100
Hey, you might still go to jail

43:18.100 --> 43:20.380
so just give it a rest, mate,

43:20.380 --> 43:23.258
and do as you're told.

43:37.420 --> 43:41.020
SONG: # When you come round

43:41.020 --> 43:44.380
# And I fall out with myself

43:44.380 --> 43:47.940
# It's not my fault

43:47.940 --> 43:49.700
# That I can't stop

43:49.700 --> 43:53.020
# And I am withered in doubt... #

43:53.020 --> 43:54.980
JACQUI JAMES: Chook Fowler
was eventually convicted

43:54.980 --> 43:57.340
and sentenced to three years' jail.

43:57.340 --> 44:01.740
Neville Scullion resigned from
the police, but was never charged.

44:01.740 --> 44:06.180
# 'Cause the sky is falling

44:06.180 --> 44:09.060
# Step it off, step it off

44:09.060 --> 44:12.780
# 'Cause I am coming in

44:12.780 --> 44:15.658
# Shake it off, shake it off... #

44:16.700 --> 44:21.649
Trevor Haken lost his job, his wife,
his friends and his future.

44:23.220 --> 44:26.500
15 years later,

44:26.500 --> 44:28.616
he's still lost.

44:29.305 --> 44:35.710
