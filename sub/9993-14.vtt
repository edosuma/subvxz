WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:02.900
Let's go, you guys.

00:03.700 --> 00:05.000
It's time to get up.

00:06.900 --> 00:11.000
Is my nose playing tricks on me, or is somebody making bacon?

00:12.100 --> 00:13.200
Someone's trying.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.600
I had the most amazing night's sleep last night.

00:16.800 --> 00:20.400
No bad dreams, no ghosts, no gorgeous.

00:21.300 --> 00:26.900
Just sweet lights out, dead-to-the-world unconsciousness.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.000
I guess one night a year's not so bad.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.300
Hey, you feeling okay?
You sound a little bit stuffed up.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.500
Feel much better now, thank you very much.

00:41.602 --> 00:42.601
Al, what's wrong?

00:45.300 --> 00:46.004
Who are you?

00:48.003 --> 00:49.009
What?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.400
Who are you?! Where's my husband?!

00:53.300 --> 00:54.600
Your husband is standing right in front of you

00:54.700 --> 00:56.500
trying to figure out what the hell has gotten into is wife.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.500
Girls, come out here right now!

01:05.500 --> 01:06.400
What's wrong, Mommy?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.300
Mom, are you okay?

01:17.400 --> 01:19.300
Mom, are you okay?

01:22.300 --> 01:25.300
Hey, Al. Hey, can you hear me?

01:26.210 --> 01:29.600
Al? Al?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.200
What happened?

01:32.500 --> 01:34.000
We were in the kitchen and we heard a crash.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.900
You slipped on the tile and you knocked yourself out for a second.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.900
Are you okay?

01:43.200 --> 01:44.500
Yeah.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.600
I'm just really glad to see you guys.

02:35.500 --> 02:40.500
No, she isn't bleeding, but she's got a lump 
the size of an egg on the back of her head.

02:42.700 --> 02:43.800
Yeah, I understand that.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.600
But what is the point of taking 
her to a primary care physician

02:46.800 --> 02:48.600
when I know he's just going 
to tell her to get an MRI?

02:50.100 --> 02:52.400
Can't we just cut to the
 chase and spare her a trip?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.500
Okay, what will our plan pay for?

02:58.200 --> 02:59.400
Did you see any stars?

03:00.200 --> 03:00.800
No, sweetie.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.800
What about planets or birds?

03:03.300 --> 03:05.000
Like birds flying in a circle?

03:05.600 --> 03:07.000
That's only in cartoons.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.800
So, that doesn't mean that it doesn't really happen in real life.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.800
Actually, it does.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.900
Girls, please, I've got a bit of a headache.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.200
Man, please don't transfer me to Member Services.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.500
They're the ones who transferred me to you.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.000
I'm sorry. Can you hold on just one second?
I got another call coming through.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.900
- Hello. Chan, this really isn't a good time.
- Do you remember your name?

03:25.900 --> 03:28.200
Of course, she remembers her name.
Why wouldn't she?

03:28.900 --> 03:31.700
Well, sometimes when people get
 hit in the head, they forget stuff.

03:32.100 --> 03:32.900
Thanks.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.500
Where'd you learn that, cartoons?

03:35.900 --> 03:37.000
My name's Allison Dubois.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.200
What's my name?

03:38.600 --> 03:39.300
You are Bridgette.

03:39.700 --> 03:40.600
And where do we live?

03:41.300 --> 03:43.600
We live in Phoenix, Arizona, and Bridg, 
I really don't want...

03:43.700 --> 03:44.800
And where were you born?

03:46.800 --> 03:47.300
What?

03:47.900 --> 03:49.900
Where... were...

03:50.400 --> 03:52.500
you... born?

03:53.900 --> 03:55.900
You do remember it, don't you, Mom?

03:56.700 --> 03:57.800
Of course, I remember.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.400
Mommy can't remember where she was born!

04:10.000 --> 04:10.800
Okay, you hear that?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.600
My wife can't remember where 
she was born. She needs an MRI.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.700
That's the other line again.
 Just, just let me get rid of it.

04:17.899 --> 04:20.100
Hello. Chan, I told you check the top drawer.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.100
Then check all the drawers.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.700
Chan, I'm in the middle of something right now.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.800
My wife fell and she hit her head 
and now these clowns at our HMO

04:29.900 --> 04:31.400
are telling us that we can't get an MRI till...

04:32.600 --> 04:34.400
Yeah, no. I know. I know your wife's a doctor.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.000
Really? She would do that? Are you sure?

04:41.700 --> 04:43.600
That would be fantastic. What's the address?

04:50.300 --> 04:52.100
I don't understand. This isn't a hospital.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.800
No, it's a private imaging center.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.900
They'll scan anyone or anything
 as long as you pay for it.

04:58.900 --> 04:59.600
Wait a second.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.600
Are we willing to pay for it?

05:01.500 --> 05:03.500
Chan from my design group, his wife works here.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.100
She's a doctor. She owns a piece of the place.

05:05.300 --> 05:06.300
She's doing us a favor.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.700
That's nice, but I'm not sure how I feel about that.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.300
It's okay. People have MRIs all the time.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.300
There's nothing to it.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.400
Have you ever had one?

05:19.700 --> 05:20.400
I've read about it.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.400
They're completely harmless.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.600
Fine. You go first.

05:25.100 --> 05:28.200
Hey,  listen, Chan's wife has been
 really nicefitting us inlike this.

05:28.700 --> 05:29.400
I know.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.100
I'm going to check in with 
the office. I'll be right back.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.800
Your husband's right.
There's nothing to be nervous about.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.400
How do you know?

05:47.100 --> 05:49.000
I'm a regular. I'm in here all the time.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.600
I have a season pass.

05:51.800 --> 05:54.300
They can never get enough 
pictures of my friend up there.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.100
I'm not going to lie to you.

05:58.400 --> 06:04.000
Holding perfectly still inside a steel 
tube can be a little claustrophobic.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.200
I'll tell you what I do.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.300
The machine makes this kind 
of loud clanging sound.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.300
I just kind of close my eyes 
and pretend I'm on a train.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.600
Clang, clang, clang.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.500
I'm just on a train going somewhere exotic.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.700
I don't know. It works for me.

06:26.300 --> 06:27.600
Thank you. I appreciate the tip.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.900
David Saunders?

06:31.800 --> 06:32.800
Guilty as charged.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.100
Nice meeting you.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.000
You, too.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Feel free to watch if you think it will help.

06:38.900 --> 06:39.500
Excuse me?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.900
From the observation room. I don't mind.

06:43.600 --> 06:47.100
Oh, yeah, well, maybe.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.200
You'll see. There's nothing to it.

06:50.000 --> 06:50.800
It's okay, right?

06:51.300 --> 06:53.700
It's fine with me if it's okay with Dr. Sooran.

06:54.300 --> 06:57.000
Maybe we could ask her.
Our husbands work together.

06:57.700 --> 07:01.900
Just give me a minute to change
 into the highly flattering gown.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.700
Did I miss something?

07:09.900 --> 07:12.700
That  guy said that I could go
 and watch him get his MRI.

07:13.300 --> 07:17.400
Cool. An all-access pass 
to a stranger's brain scan.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.300
Excellent.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.600
See that? You don't even 
have to scooch in.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.300
It's automatic scooching.

07:35.100 --> 07:37.400
That sound, that sounds like a parade.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.500
No, I don't think so.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.000
I think it sounds like a... train.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.600
Hey, lover boy, you lonely?

08:30.300 --> 08:32.600
Yes, I am... Jade.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.700
Can I offer you a ride?

08:36.500 --> 08:37.000
Sure.

08:52.300 --> 08:53.500
So, where we going, baby?

08:53.900 --> 08:56.700
My house for the weekend.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.200
Oh, I don't know.
The whole weekend?

09:00.100 --> 09:02.000
What about my other boyfriends,baby?

09:05.600 --> 09:06.900
I'm sorry, that was mean.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.500
I don't have other boyfriends.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.500
So where's your house, baby?

09:28.600 --> 09:29.300
What's that?

09:30.500 --> 09:31.200
The train.

09:32.000 --> 09:32.900
We're a block away.

09:46.100 --> 09:50.400
Wow, baby, that was amazing, baby, mmm.

09:59.702 --> 10:00.301
Hey, honey...

10:03.400 --> 10:04.804
would you like me to touch you now?

10:05.703 --> 10:07.509
Want me to scratch your back?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.800
I give a great massage.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.600
Maybe I could wash you.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.700
If you untie me...

10:14.900 --> 10:16.100
We can take a bath.

10:17.900 --> 10:18.700
Please, baby?

10:19.400 --> 10:20.700
It's starting to hurt.

10:21.900 --> 10:22.800
Shh...

10:24.600 --> 10:26.600
Do you like the desert? 

10:30.400 --> 10:31.800
What are you doing?

10:38.500 --> 10:39.600
Have you seen enough?

10:42.200 --> 10:43.900
Huh, honey? You seen enough?

10:44.600 --> 10:44.900
Yeah.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.100
Yeah, I've seen plenty.

10:53.700 --> 10:57.000
David Saunders, 
white, mid-30s, five ten-ish.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.200
I think I counted five girls,

11:00.700 --> 11:02.500
but he only referred to one of them by name.

11:03.000 --> 11:03.900
Um, Jade.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.800
Although I'm guessing 
that's not a real name anyway.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.600
She has light hair, light eyes.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.500
That's me. Needles-in-a-Haystack-R-Us.

11:15.600 --> 11:19.400
I got to go. My husband's 
giving me the evil eye,

11:19.700 --> 11:21.300
and my doctor'll be in any second.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.500
Detective Scanlon says hi.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.800
Joe says hi, too.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.000
All right, I'll talk to you later.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.800
You know, two hours ago, you couldn't 
remember where you were born,

11:35.900 --> 11:38.200
and now you're phoning the police, 
asking them to start investigating

11:38.300 --> 11:40.700
a man you spent all of three minutes with.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.000
Am I the only one who 
sees a contradiction here?

11:45.100 --> 11:47.500
Mr. and Mrs. Dubois,
so sorry to have kept you waiting.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.400
No, we're just happy
 that you could fit us in.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.300
Uh, besides, we were enjoying the music.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.600
Yes, the walls in this place are pretty thin.

11:56.900 --> 11:58.300
It make it hard to concentrate.

11:59.100 --> 12:02.600
It's sort of like living near an airport...
after a while you stop noticing the planes.

12:04.700 --> 12:08.200
Well, I'm happ report, the MRI shows 
no structural damage whatsoever.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.800
I know you mentioned experiencing 
some dizziness fofulness.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.400
Both symptoms should be entirely transitory.

12:16.300 --> 12:19.200
So I can go back to using the
 bathroom without fear of a relapse?

12:19.900 --> 12:21.000
Absolutly.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.500
I'd take it easy for the rest of the day,
 but yes, by tomorrow,

12:23.600 --> 12:25.300
you can do pretty much anything you like.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.200
You hear that? 
I'm okay; you're stuck with me.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.000
I was afraid she'd broken her funny bone.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.900
Before you go, there's one 
small thing I wanted to ask about.

12:38.300 --> 12:38.900
Of course.

12:39.900 --> 12:43.400
I notice on your patient history form
 that you didn't check the box for epilepsy.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.600
Well, I'm not epileptic.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.700
Then you've never had any lems with seizures?

12:49.900 --> 12:52.300
No,  never.Why would you ask ?

12:54.500 --> 12:58.100
You see this gray spot here,looks a little like a peanut?

12:59.900 --> 13:01.200
It's called venous angioma.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.100
Sounds scarier than it really is.

13:04.600 --> 13:08.200
It's actually just a small tangle 
of exveins in one part of the brain.

13:09.700 --> 13:10.900
How long do you suppose that was there?

13:11.300 --> 13:12.300
Probably since birth.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.800
Typically they're founding it in
the brain of epileptic but considering

13:15.900 --> 13:17.700
you've  lived your whole life 
and never had a single seizure,

13:18.000 --> 13:19.700
I think it's safe to assume it's benign.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.600
You think or you know ?

13:22.200 --> 13:22.800
I know.

13:23.500 --> 13:27.900
Trust me, Mr. Dubois, if the angioma had been 
affecting your wife in any negative way

13:28.000 --> 13:29.300
she would've known about it a long time ago.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.700
I would've been having seizures.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.600
That's one possibility, yes.

13:33.400 --> 13:38.500
But angiomas in this part of the brain have 
also been associated to visual trouble,ephemera.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.300
I'm sorry, ephemera ?

13:40.800 --> 13:42.500
A fancy word for hallucinations.

13:42.900 --> 13:45.800
Hearing voices, seeing people 
and things that aren't really there.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.600
But... since you didn't check the box for that, either,

13:52.100 --> 13:53.500
I don't think you have to worry about.

13:57.100 --> 14:02.200
Hearing voices...uh, seeing people 
and things there aren't really there.

14:02.900 --> 14:05.200
Uh, stop me if any of this starts to sound familiar.

14:05.400 --> 14:05.900
Not funny.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.700
It's not meant to be. But think about it Alison.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.100
What if this angioma

14:10.700 --> 14:14.000
is the reason that you see the things that you see,

14:14.200 --> 14:15.600
the reason that you hearthe things that you hear?

14:15.900 --> 14:16.900
They're not hallucination.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.000
No, I know that.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.700
So what are you getting at ?

14:20.300 --> 14:21.600
I'm getting at a theorie,

14:21.700 --> 14:25.500
I'm getting at the possibility thats this 
little peanut that we found in your brain today

14:25.800 --> 14:29.000
might be what makes you so different from all the other girls.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.300
You're angry.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.000
You're psychic-- you must have 
a little peanut in your head .

14:38.100 --> 14:38.900
Actually, I'm not.

14:39.900 --> 14:45.500
I'm  trying to figure out why you'suddenly so obsessed
 with reducing what I do to something... physiological.

14:46.400 --> 14:51.600
I'm a scientist, and taking complicated things and 
reducing them to their simplest eles is what I do.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.300
And you, my dear, are a very complicated thing.

15:30.800 --> 15:31.800
Something the matter?

15:32.600 --> 15:35.400
I-I don't know. I can't seem to find my car.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.000
You don't remember what level you parked it on?

15:38.810 --> 15:39.800
No, I-I thought...

15:43.200 --> 15:44.400
Well, I'm sure  it's around here somewhere.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.200
What kind of car do you drive?

15:49.900 --> 15:50.700
What kind of car?

15:51.600 --> 15:54.000
The make, the color-- that sort of stuff.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.000
Nothing. I just wanted to make sure you were you.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.800
Can't you do that when I'm asleep?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.900
Mommy, where were you born?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.200
I was born in Chelsea, Oklahoma,sweets.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
And what's your middle name?

16:52.400 --> 16:59.200
Louise. My name is Allison Louise Dubois,
and I drive a metallic beige station wagon.

17:01.700 --> 17:02.400
Good morning, girls.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.500
- Morning, Daddy. 
- Hi, Daddy!

17:04.700 --> 17:05.800
Good morning.

17:07.000 --> 17:07.700
What's your name again?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.400
I know what you're up to.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.000
You're not really kissing me, 
you're kissing my inner peanut.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.700
Please! There are children in the room!

17:22.599 --> 17:24.500
What? Was it something I said?

17:27.700 --> 17:30.300
You got a love note from that Scanlon fellow.

17:37.900 --> 17:41.500
Good news, girls...
Mommy's completely back to normal.

17:42.300 --> 17:42.800
H i.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.200
I don't understand, this is her.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.500
This is the girl I saw getting into David Saunders' car.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.300
Can't you at least question him about her?

17:49.900 --> 17:50.500
Based on what?

17:50.900 --> 17:52.600
Based on, I saw her tied to his bed.

17:52.700 --> 17:55.500
Based on,I think he suffocated her,
along with all the other girls I saw.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.100
I don't know what to tell you, Allison.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.000
I ran a check on this guy, and he is a Boy Scout.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.600
No priors, no arsts, no stints in rehab.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.400
Just a couple of unpaid speeding tickets
 from six or seven years ago.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.700
The guy's married, owns a copy shop, pays his taxes.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.900
Picks up prostitutes and smothers them.

18:10.200 --> 18:14.300
Maybe. Look, all I have to go on is a missing
 persons report filed by a fellow prostitute.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.100
Right? For all we know, this, uh...

18:17.600 --> 18:20.600
Jade girl could've up and moved to L.A. 
and just didn't bother to tell anyone.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.800
For six years?

18:22.700 --> 18:25.200
Come on, this report was filed in 1999.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.100
Did the cops even look into it?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.400
I'm sure the department did the best 
they could with what they were given--

18:31.700 --> 18:34.400
the woman who filed the report didn't
 even know her friend 's real name.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.100
She said Jade was just her street name.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.900
Didn't know any of her friends,
didn't know anything about her family.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.400
That's not a lot to go on.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.400
Did you say this guy owns a copy shop?

18:47.800 --> 18:49.900
'Kay, thank you very much. Have a good day.

18:52.600 --> 18:52.900
Can I...

18:53.800 --> 18:55.200
Hey, you survived.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.900
My goodness, from the MRI! Hi!

18:58.600 --> 18:59.600
So, you work here?

19:00.100 --> 19:03.000
Kind of. This is my store. I own this place.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.100
You're kidding.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.600
I've never been in here before...
 what are the chances?

19:06.800 --> 19:10.700
I know. Amazing. So, really, 
how'd it go yesterday with your MRI?

19:11.200 --> 19:15.100
It went well. I-I took your suggestion.
 I told myself that I was riding on a train

19:15.200 --> 19:16.900
and it really relaxed me.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.500
It relaxed me a little too much.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.100
I think I fell asleep, my head went to the side,

19:22.500 --> 19:24.500
and half my views came out blurry.

19:24.800 --> 19:25.900
I have to go back again tomorrow.

19:26.300 --> 19:26.900
Oh, no.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.600
Yeah, well, that's why it's good I have a season pass.

19:30.100 --> 19:32.100
So, what can I do for you today, Miss...?

19:32.700 --> 19:34.100
Dubois. Allison Dubois.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.400
I don't know if I mentioned that I work 
part-time at the district attorney's office.

19:37.700 --> 19:38.800
No, you didn't.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.800
I also help out with this, uh, missing persons group.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.500
This girl has been missing for the last seven years,

19:45.800 --> 19:47.400
and we're finally reopening the case.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.000
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
 putting this flyer in your front window.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.400
Her name's Jade. She's a prostitute.

19:55.900 --> 19:57.800
She's been missing since 1999.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.300
Uh, this is strange.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.000
Really? Why do you say that?

20:03.800 --> 20:06.400
Hey, Angela, come here a minute.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.000
Dave?

20:22.600 --> 20:25.300
You have no idea how embarrassing I was.

20:27.300 --> 20:31.200
Well, you handed a man that's been nothing 
but nice to you a photograph of a prostitute

20:31.800 --> 20:33.100
that looked remarkably like his wife.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.700
I think I have a pretty good idea 
how embarrassed you were.

20:36.700 --> 20:37.800
He even showed it to her.

20:38.900 --> 20:40.300
Really? How'd she take it?

20:40.600 --> 20:41.300
Eh, she laughed.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.000
She thought it was pretty funny. So did he.

20:43.100 --> 20:47.500
Then he offered to make free copies so 
I could put it in as many windows as possible.

20:48.300 --> 20:49.100
The fiend!

20:50.000 --> 20:55.300
First he kidnaps them, then he kills them, then
he offers to reproduce their image,free of charge,

20:55.600 --> 20:57.900
so the police can have an easier time finding them.

20:59.100 --> 21:00.900
Clearly u're dealing with an evil genius here.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.800
Well, that's the thing-- 
when I was around him yesterday,

21:03.900 --> 21:05.500
I didn't feel anything like that.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.200
All I felt was kindness and warmth and honesty.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.600
And suddenly the idea of him hurting these girls,

21:10.700 --> 21:12.600
it made absolutely no sense to me.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.700
'Cause even the thought
 of doing something so horrific,

21:17.200 --> 21:21.200
so hideously evil wouldn't even
 enter a mind of a man like that.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.700
I don't understand how I could
 have been so wrong about him.

21:25.300 --> 21:27.200
Well, let's not forget about that bump on your head.

21:27.300 --> 21:28.500
Yesterday,  when you had all these visions,

21:28.700 --> 21:31.600
that bump was fresh-- maybe they're swelling,
 maybe you're a little off your game.

21:31.900 --> 21:34.200
Are you implying my peanut's 
not all it's cracked up to be?

21:34.800 --> 21:36.800
Actually I'm glad you brought that up.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.400
Remember we were talking about yesterday
 about the possiblilty that the peanut--

21:40.700 --> 21:41.900
that growth inside your head--

21:42.200 --> 21:43.600
is what makes you so sensitive?

21:44.200 --> 21:46.200
You realize you're looking 
at me like I'm a petri dish?

21:47.300 --> 21:48.400
Look, it got me to thinking.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.200
What if I have somebody actually test that theory?

21:51.300 --> 21:53.400
How would someone prove a 
correlation between venous angiomas

21:53.600 --> 21:58.000
and increased sensitivity to... I don't know... 
various psychic phenomenon?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.100
Gosh, Mr. Wizard, I don't know.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.200
I guess you'd have to find somebody 
else who's kind of sensitive

22:03.300 --> 22:05.000
and scan their brain see if there's an angioma.

22:06.300 --> 22:07.200
That's my thought exactly.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.800
You can't be serious.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.200
Oh, I'm  completely serious.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.400
- There's no way in the wide world I'm gonna let you. 
- It's perfectly safe, Al.

22:18.900 --> 22:22.800
- You're subjecting our daughters to MRIs! 
- There's no radiation, no side-effects.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.700
Dr. Sooran said she wouldn't
 even charge us a dime.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.100
You already spoke to her?

22:26.500 --> 22:29.300
Not about the psychic stuff. 
Just about getting scanned for the girls.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.100
See if they gave angiomas, too.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.500
It's intriguing, Al, the possibility 
that there might be a genetic link.

22:34.900 --> 22:37.700
I mean, it's pretty heady stuff.
 No pun intended.

22:38.100 --> 22:38.800
What about the girls?

22:39.100 --> 22:43.900
Have you at least thought about how traumatic it 
could be to be trapped in that metal,clanging coffin

22:44.000 --> 22:45.800
so that Daddy could take pictures of your brain?

22:47.200 --> 22:49.500
There's a machine that can
 take a picture of my brain?

22:51.100 --> 22:55.500
It's called an MRI, sweetie, and there's no reason
 in the wide world that you should get one

22:55.800 --> 22:57.100
'cause you're perfectly fine.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.800
But what if I want one?

23:03.800 --> 23:05.400
Try to stay perfectly still, honey.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.300
Sorry! My toe itched, but I think I got it.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.100
This is gonna make for 
one hell of a show-and-tell.

23:15.700 --> 23:16.800
Cooool.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.200
Like mother, like daughter.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.400
You found another peanut?

23:26.500 --> 23:27.700
The exact same spot as Mom.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.500
I have a peanut in my head?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.400
Just a little extra lump of brain that looks like one.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.800
And Mommy has one, too?

23:41.300 --> 23:43.500
That's right, kiddo. Mommy has one, too.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.700
I understand there's another daughter.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.600
Perhaps we could find the time.

23:48.900 --> 23:52.200
Perhaps we could find the time 
to perform a scan on her as well.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.100
You did a wonderful job, Bridgette.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.700
I'm sure your mom and 
dad are real proud of you.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.200
Hey, honey.

24:10.601 --> 24:12.501
Would you like me to touch you now?

24:13.700 --> 24:15.200
Want me to scratch your back?

24:16.400 --> 24:17.500
I give a great massage.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.400
Maybe I could wash you.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.800
If you untie me... We can take a bath.

24:26.000 --> 24:26.600
Please, baby?

24:27.400 --> 24:28.300
It's starting to hurt.

24:30.000 --> 24:30.400
Shhh...

24:32.500 --> 24:34.200
Do you like the desert? 

24:38.900 --> 24:39.900
What are you doing?

25:08.700 --> 25:10.700
Again, I don't know what this all means.

25:10.900 --> 25:13.000
This extra pocket of blood flow to the brain.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.900
Perhaps I could interview you sometime.

25:15.900 --> 25:17.100
Interview you both.

25:17.700 --> 25:21.500
See if there's some manisfestation of all this
 that we can identify and quantify.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.400
But first we need to get Ariel in here.

25:26.100 --> 25:29.500
Yes, if they all have it, 
then we're truly onto something.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.900
Well, I say that was two hours very well spent.

25:42.100 --> 25:43.800
You understand her point about Ariel?

25:47.100 --> 25:47.600
Mrs. Dubois!

25:49.000 --> 25:49.600
Back for seconds.

25:50.900 --> 25:51.100
Hi.

25:52.000 --> 25:52.200
Hi.

25:52.700 --> 25:53.300
How you doing?

25:54.000 --> 25:54.800
That was you in there?

25:55.500 --> 25:56.600
I told you, I'm a regular.

25:57.500 --> 26:00.800
The joke around here is that I keep 
mistaking this place for a tanning salon.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.300
Hey, did you ever find that girl?

26:06.800 --> 26:08.600
No. Not yet.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.300
The desert.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.100
They think she was buried in the desert,
 along with a few others.

26:16.100 --> 26:17.100
You mean someone...

26:17.500 --> 26:18.100
Smothered them...

26:19.200 --> 26:20.100
and buried them.

26:21.000 --> 26:21.900
That's the theory.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.600
And they've been rotting in the sun ever since.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.900
They've been sitting there and rotting
 for the last five or six years.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.300
Excuse me. I...

26:38.300 --> 26:42.300
I think a simple "No. We're still working on it. 
She hasn't turned up yet." would have sufficed.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
You meet him, you're with him. 
He seems like the nicest guy in the world.

26:55.600 --> 27:00.500
He goes into this machine, he gets scanned, 
and suddenly I see this whole other side of him.

27:00.900 --> 27:02.200
Maybe you do and maybe you don't.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.800
What's that mean?

27:04.000 --> 27:06.500
Allison, I believe you when 
you say you see his thoughts,

27:06.600 --> 27:08.500
but thoughts are not necessarily memories.

27:09.200 --> 27:12.400
They can be ideas or fantasies.

27:13.200 --> 27:16.400
Didn't you say that his wife first 
appeared to you as a prostitute?

27:18.300 --> 27:23.100
Wall, from what I've read, he wouldn't be the 
first man to have had that particular daydream.

27:23.500 --> 27:28.200
Well, with all due respect, sir, these are violent,
 gruesome, horrible encounters that I'm seeing.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.100
But if they never really happened,

27:30.600 --> 27:31.800
they're not illegal.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.000
Allison, I don't know what to tell you.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.400
The man you're suspicious of has no real record.

27:37.100 --> 27:39.500
There appear to be no real victims, and my suspicion is,

27:39.700 --> 27:41.200
what we've got here is no real crime.

27:43.200 --> 27:43.500
Allison?

27:45.600 --> 27:46.300
Allison?

27:46.600 --> 27:47.500
Excuse me.

27:50.200 --> 27:50.600
Allison!

27:52.600 --> 27:53.200
Mrs. Saunders.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.700
Angela, are you looking for me?

28:00.200 --> 28:01.900
If I tell you a secret...

28:03.700 --> 28:05.400
If I take you into my confidence,

28:06.900 --> 28:09.600
how can I be sure that 
you aren't gonna tell my husband?

28:11.800 --> 28:13.900
When your husband isn't 
running his copy shop,

28:14.500 --> 28:16.300
does he work for the prosecutor's office?

28:17.500 --> 28:19.700
Then I have no reason to 
tell him anything, Angela.

28:24.000 --> 28:24.900
It's not Angela.

28:25.700 --> 28:28.300
Um... it's Jade.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.400
Actually, or Melanie.

28:33.300 --> 28:34.100
Really, but, um...

28:35.800 --> 28:37.700
My name, my street name--

28:39.500 --> 28:43.200
at least the first time that I met David-- was Jade.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.400
I'd seen his car around before.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
There was something about him... some...

28:51.900 --> 28:55.400
essense that you picked up.
 This, uh, this core of niceness.

28:55.700 --> 28:58.200
Hey, loverboy, you lonely?

28:58.400 --> 28:58.900
Sure.

28:59.900 --> 29:01.000
Oh, I was such a mess.

29:03.300 --> 29:04.600
I even let him tie me up.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.300
What's that?

29:17.000 --> 29:17.500
The train.

29:18.300 --> 29:19.200
We're a block away.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.700
There was one little problem.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.800
He finished too early.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.600
You see, my pimp and I had 
come to this new arrangement.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.900
When I came across someone 
who wanted to take me home,

29:34.700 --> 29:36.700
if it seemed like he had some money and...

29:37.100 --> 29:39.800
wouldn't put up much of a fuss, 
my pimp would follow us,

29:40.300 --> 29:45.200
and then he would break in and rob the place 
while I kept the john occupied in the bedroom.

29:45.400 --> 29:45.800
Shh!

29:47.900 --> 29:48.900
Do you like the desert?

29:53.800 --> 29:55.300
So he broke in around midnight,

29:58.200 --> 30:00.500
...knocked over a lamp 
on his way into the window.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.200
Wh-Where you are going, baby?

30:02.900 --> 30:04.400
Come back, baby, come back!

30:04.500 --> 30:07.300
They met each other in the hallway. 
There was a fight.

30:09.300 --> 30:10.300
And then I heard a gunshot.

30:15.700 --> 30:16.200
What did you do?

30:17.200 --> 30:18.400
What did you do?!

30:20.300 --> 30:21.400
He dragged me out of there.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.900
David was lying there in the hallway,

30:25.200 --> 30:26.200
bleeding from his head.

30:28.100 --> 30:29.100
He wasn't moving.

30:29.800 --> 30:30.800
What did you do?

30:32.900 --> 30:34.900
I waited till my pimp got high and then...

30:35.900 --> 30:37.400
I snuck away and I called 911.

30:38.700 --> 30:43.300
The next day I read in the paper that 
a bullet had passed through David's skull.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.500
He almost bled to death on the floor.

30:47.900 --> 30:49.000
So you saved his life.

30:50.600 --> 30:51.100
Yeah.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.100
In a strange way, he, uh, 
he returned the favor.

30:57.600 --> 30:58.800
I don't know what it was...

30:59.200 --> 31:03.900
but being that close to death-- 
something about it, it... it changed me.

31:05.900 --> 31:07.000
I got myself off the street.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.400
I checked into rehab.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.700
A couple months later,I was deep into
 the program. You know, the 12 steps?

31:13.800 --> 31:17.900
And I had taken all my personal inventory 
and now it was time for step nine:

31:18.200 --> 31:19.000
making amends.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.500
I went to David's hospital room,

31:24.400 --> 31:30.700
all ready to tell him what I'd done, you know,
 accept responisibility,take the consequences.

31:32.500 --> 31:36.300
And that's when I realized 
he didn't remember me.

31:37.300 --> 31:38.300
He didn't remember anything.

31:39.300 --> 31:41.900
His life before that night--it was a blank.

31:43.300 --> 31:47.100
He had been in the hospital 
for months with his friends

31:47.700 --> 31:50.900
coming by every day, trying to
 fill in his memory for him,

31:51.800 --> 31:54.600
reminding him that, uh,
 he loved watching baseball.

31:55.100 --> 31:56.600
That his favorite food was pizza.

31:59.300 --> 32:00.600
Of course they couldn't fill him in...

32:00.800 --> 32:04.100
on the parts of his life that
 they didn't know anything about--

32:06.000 --> 32:07.900
the cruising, the girls off the street.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.700
And they didn't know anything about 
what got him into the hospital

32:13.000 --> 32:15.100
except for what they read 
in the paper, you know,

32:15.300 --> 32:19.800
that a man had broken into his 
home and shot him, left him for dead.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.400
I started visiting him every day,

32:23.800 --> 32:26.100
First at the hospital,then at his business.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.800
I should have told him then, you know?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
I should have told him everything.

32:34.500 --> 32:35.200
But I couldn't.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.200
Before I knew it I was in love.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.100
And so was he.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.500
We've been married for five years now. 
We want to have a family.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.700
That man who used to pick up girls off
 the street? He doesn't exist anymore.

32:56.300 --> 32:58.200
And that girl that, uh, you're looking for?

32:59.800 --> 33:00.800
Well, she's fine.

33:01.900 --> 33:03.100
Oh, she's better than fine.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.800
Isn't there any way that
we can put the past behind us?

33:11.200 --> 33:14.400
Particularly when there is
 so much future to look forward to?

33:18.100 --> 33:18.500
Wow...

33:21.100 --> 33:22.200
Let me see what I can do.

33:26.900 --> 33:28.100
And he has no idea?

33:29.900 --> 33:32.300
About her past? Apparently not.

33:32.900 --> 33:34.800
And the ultimate romantic irony?

33:36.100 --> 33:38.200
She has no idea about his.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.900
Although, who am I kidding?
 I'm not certain about his past either.

33:42.900 --> 33:44.300
Maybe Devalos was right.

33:44.700 --> 33:49.800
Maybe what I tapped into when he was in 
that machine was some sort of dark fantasy.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.500
I can feel the heat coming 
off your brain from here.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.800
What are you chewing on?

34:01.500 --> 34:04.300
Mm, nothing much. Just the mystery of life.

34:05.200 --> 34:05.800
That again.

34:07.100 --> 34:11.199
You need to get your head out of the clouds
 and think about something that matters.

34:11.600 --> 34:15.000
Mm...Are we really just the sum of our memories?

34:16.600 --> 34:19.900
Wait a second. I know the answer to that.
 I read it in a magazine.

34:23.100 --> 34:26.300
I mean, David Saunders,
he looks at his wife and he sees...

34:26.400 --> 34:31.400
this wonderful woman that he met in the hospital
 while he was recovering from a horrible accident.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.500
That's who she is to him, that's all he knows,

34:36.699 --> 34:38.600
and when he wakes up in the 
morning he looks in the mirror

34:39.300 --> 34:45.500
he doesn't see a guy who went cruising downtown 
looking for strangers to have sex with, or worse.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
He sees the guy that I see when
 I go visit him at the print shop.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.100
A member of the Chamber of Commerce.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.500
A little league sponsor. A devoted husband.

34:56.100 --> 34:57.500
Well, maybe.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.400
What do you mean maybe?

34:59.500 --> 35:02.000
I mean, who knows what
really goes on in someone's brain?

35:02.800 --> 35:06.000
Who knows what memories actually 
survive and what might trigger them.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.300
Anyway, what are we talking about?

35:08.400 --> 35:10.000
Didn't you tell me you were pretty much convinced

35:10.100 --> 35:11.700
that whatever you saw didn't really happen?

35:12.200 --> 35:12.900
Was only in his head.

35:13.900 --> 35:14.800
No, I keep thinking...

35:15.700 --> 35:18.600
if I see it, it's in his head,

35:18.700 --> 35:20.800
and if it's in his head, it's in his head for a reason.

35:21.900 --> 35:25.200
If a memory is killed in the forest 
and there's no one there to hear it...

35:26.000 --> 35:26.800
Ha, ha, ha.

35:28.700 --> 35:31.200
What time do we have to go 
to this MRI place in the morning?

35:32.400 --> 35:34.500
I don't know what to tell you. I don't see it.

35:35.100 --> 35:38.200
I don't see any signs of venous 
angioma in Ariel's brain.

35:38.800 --> 35:39.500
- Oh...
- Oh.

35:40.800 --> 35:41.700
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:42.500 --> 35:43.300
Good news.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.600
Absolutely. Very good.

35:51.600 --> 35:52.600
You're disappointed, aren't you?

35:53.700 --> 35:54.900
Ah, it was a nice theory.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.800
Would ha answered a lot of questions.

35:59.200 --> 36:04.500
I admit it, I had visions of newborns all over 
the world being tested for the "Dubois angioma".

36:04.600 --> 36:06.800
Ah, the Dubois angioma. Nice.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.400
Hi, sorry I'm late. You wanted to see me?

36:11.100 --> 36:12.200
Yeah. No big deal.

36:12.500 --> 36:16.000
I just wanted to let you know that I received
 the rest of the inquiry on David Saunders.

36:17.100 --> 36:20.900
Went all the way back to 1995 
and there's really nothing there.

36:21.100 --> 36:23.200
A couple of neighbors'complaints about noise,

36:23.500 --> 36:25.700
a parking ticket, a couple of traffic violations...

36:27.100 --> 36:27.900
What are these?

36:28.400 --> 36:31.600
Those are evidence shots from 
a photo-enforced stoplight he ran in 1998.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.100
You've seen them-- you run the light and 
it automatically takes pictures of the car,

36:35.500 --> 36:37.500
whoever's driving, the license plate...

36:37.900 --> 36:41.200
Pretty much eliminates people going
 to trial over traffic tickets-- why?

36:43.300 --> 36:44.800
See this woman here in the front seat?

36:50.700 --> 36:51.800
I've seen her before.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.600
It's not about you. It's about him.

37:23.300 --> 37:24.700
Well, I guess that's me.

37:25.700 --> 37:28.300
I have no idea who that
 woman seated next to me is.

37:28.900 --> 37:31.400
Her name is Delmy. Delmy O'Toole.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.000
She's a prostitute.

37:34.300 --> 37:35.300
Was a prostitute.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.600
No one here is suggesting that
that's what she was doing in your car,

37:40.900 --> 37:45.000
or that you were in engaged in anything 
illegal or inappropriate, Mr. Saunders, but...

37:45.700 --> 37:49.200
we have been conducting a review 
of open missing persons cases.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.900
Miss O'Toole's been missing since the late '90s.

37:53.200 --> 37:58.400
And I am aware of the unique circumstances surrounding 
your memory of anything that might have happened so long ago,

37:58.600 --> 38:01.700
but, still, when we came across this photo...

38:03.500 --> 38:04.900
Well, this is very strange.

38:05.100 --> 38:08.200
I mean, weren't you asking me about 
another missing person just last week?

38:08.500 --> 38:09.600
Another prostitute?

38:11.900 --> 38:14.300
I mean, is their something I don't know?

38:15.200 --> 38:16.900
Was I someone who spent a lot of...

38:17.600 --> 38:19.800
No, uh... We have a right to a lawyer, right?

38:20.200 --> 38:21.100
No, we don't need a lawyer.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.300
I haven't done anything wrong.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.000
And you haven't done anything wrong.

38:25.300 --> 38:27.400
Of course. You always have the right to an attorney, but frankly,

38:27.800 --> 38:29.600
no one here is being accused of anything.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.800
We were just hoping that you could shed 
some light on these missing persons cases.

38:33.700 --> 38:36.000
Cases? You mean there are more?

38:36.300 --> 38:36.900
Yes, sir.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.200
- Prostitutes? 
- Oh, David...

38:40.400 --> 38:41.200
No, this is nothing.

38:41.800 --> 38:43.000
This has nothing to do with us.

38:43.700 --> 38:46.500
They're just trying to find some missing people. Sh...

38:54.200 --> 38:55.100
I don't know this woman.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.400
No. I'm sorry.

39:07.600 --> 39:08.900
- No. 
- He doesn't know them...

39:09.900 --> 39:13.100
Okay ? He doesn't. Now, if he met
 them before the accident,

39:13.200 --> 39:14.200
he doesn't remember them.

39:14.900 --> 39:16.900
And besides, what difference 
does that make? That was then.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.900
Do you like the desert, Mr. Saunders?

39:31.300 --> 39:32.800
Do you like the desert?

39:34.800 --> 39:37.900
No, he... no, he doesn't like the desert. 
He refuses to go there.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.400
Okay, where ever it is that
 you're trying to go with this,

39:40.500 --> 39:42.200
- you're barking up... 
- Shut up, Jade!

40:01.100 --> 40:03.500
David, David, I love you.

40:05.800 --> 40:10.500
I've loved you every second of every
 single day since I met you at the hospital.

40:12.400 --> 40:13.500
And whatever happened before,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.500
I swear to God, that doesn't matter, okay? Tell me.

40:18.100 --> 40:19.100
Tell me that it doesn't matter.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.800
I love you, too, Angela.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.400
This isn't about something you did.

40:32.700 --> 40:34.700
I think this is about something I might have done.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.100
Yeah, but I forgive you.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.600
And I love you.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.500
But I'm not so sure you should.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.000
I think perhaps...

40:53.800 --> 40:56.500
perhaps I might not be 
the man you think I am.

40:56.700 --> 40:58.100
No, no...

41:00.300 --> 41:00.600
No.

41:05.300 --> 41:05.900
Yes.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.200
I'm sorry.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.500
Can I see those pictures again?

41:24.100 --> 41:28.400
I think... I would like to go to the desert, actually.

41:39.400 --> 41:40.800
Do you think we could take a ride?

41:47.100 --> 41:50.000
Oh... look who finally made it home.

41:52.100 --> 41:52.700
Hi.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.800
Hi, stranger.

41:56.500 --> 41:57.600
How was the desert?

41:58.900 --> 42:02.700
It was filled with secrets. 
Filled with corpses.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.500
Good for you. You got him.

42:08.800 --> 42:09.800
I guess.

42:13.800 --> 42:14.800
You guess?

42:16.200 --> 42:17.200
I don't know.

42:19.200 --> 42:22.200
We got the right man, 
I guess that's a good thing.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.900
So what's bothering you?

42:27.900 --> 42:28.400
Come here.

42:36.500 --> 42:39.100
Al, what are you doing?

42:42.400 --> 42:46.000
I want to remember this moment 
for the rest of my life.

42:48.001 --> 42:51.001
