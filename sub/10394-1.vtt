This house came to be built by Dr.
Blake.

01:58.652 --> 02:03.990
My grandfather came to be
nominated to the council of

02:03.991 --> 02:06.526
state which used to be a
part of British India.

02:06.527 --> 02:14.527
It was another time, one
that few still remember.

02:15.002 --> 02:17.570
The India before partition, when

02:17.571 --> 02:24.577
these rooms, this house, was
part of the seat of power.

02:24.578 --> 02:27.214
I had the privilege of being

02:27.215 --> 02:33.353
born in this house upstairs.

02:33.354 --> 02:39.526
This was the maharajah's bed.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.395
His chambers are present.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.298
We went up to my grandfather's
room to wish him

02:45.299 --> 02:50.370
good morning and we would
all come down to breakfast.

02:50.371 --> 02:53.105
The walls tell a story.

02:53.106 --> 02:56.876
Many stories.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.912
There used to be a
lot of animosity.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.581
There were two very divided

03:01.582 --> 03:06.052
classes in India so there was a

03:06.053 --> 03:08.888
lot of tension between the
ruled and the rulers.

03:08.889 --> 03:13.226
But that was a different
time, you know.

03:13.227 --> 03:21.227
Now I think back and it's
more like a fairy tale.

food comes from here.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.022
The Punjab of the early 20th

05:23.023 --> 05:24.457
century saw some of the most

05:24.458 --> 05:28.628
violent resistance
to British rule.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.697
And when the British finally

05:30.698 --> 05:33.733
cashed out in 1947, they carved

05:33.734 --> 05:38.304
off a huge piece,
what is now Pakistan.

05:38.305 --> 05:41.941
And it remains a potential
flashpoint for conflict.

To eat around this part of

06:13.574 --> 06:17.410
the world, Punjab in particular,

06:17.411 --> 06:19.612
get used to eating a
lot of vegetables.

India is one of the few places

on earth where even for
me, that's not a burden.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.685
What's that?

06:25.686 --> 06:27.787
I'll take that.

Right here, my good man.

colors, flavors and spices.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.003
Unlike some of the joyless

06:44.004 --> 06:45.438
vegetarian restaurants in my sad

06:45.439 --> 06:48.475
experience, vegetables here are

06:48.476 --> 06:49.942
actually spicy, all taste

06:49.943 --> 06:55.482
different, different textures.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.550
And served with
extraordinarily good bread.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.185
It's got this multi-tiered

chewy in the middle.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.590

experience.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.291
If this was what vegetarianism

07:05.292 --> 07:06.292
meant in most of the places that

07:06.293 --> 07:08.060
practice it in the west, I would

07:08.061 --> 07:11.964

07:11.965 --> 07:13.800
a... about the subject.

07:13.801 --> 07:14.867

07:14.868 --> 07:16.302
I might eat in your restaurant.

07:16.303 --> 07:24.303
Mm.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.022
Around here, one of the first
things you notice that's

07:36.023 --> 07:41.728
different from the rest of
India, turbans everywhere.

07:41.729 --> 07:45.765
The symbol of self-respect,

07:45.766 --> 07:49.536
bravery and spirituality
for Sikh men.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.337
This is the home, the spiritual

07:51.338 --> 07:53.606
center of the Sikh faith, the

07:53.607 --> 07:59.011
world's largest and maybe
most misunderstood religion.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.614
In the heart stands the majestic

08:01.615 --> 08:09.615
golden temple, the Sikh
equivalent of the Vatican.

08:10.390 --> 08:14.060
Sikhs are fundamentally against

08:14.061 --> 08:16.028
any caste system, believers in

08:16.029 --> 08:18.264
religious tolerance, but they
are just as fundamentally

08:18.265 --> 08:19.465
war-like when it comes to

08:19.466 --> 08:23.903
defending their principles
and what they see as their

08:23.904 --> 08:26.973
territory.

08:26.974 --> 08:27.575
Welcome to golden temple.

08:27.576 --> 08:35.576
Thank you.

08:38.217 --> 08:41.053
Today is one of the most
auspicious days of the Sikh

08:41.054 --> 08:44.056
calendar.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.291
Pilgrims from all over the world

08:45.292 --> 08:47.226
come to worship, walk the

08:47.227 --> 08:50.730
perimeter and bathe
in the holy pool.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.498
All are welcome of any faith or

08:52.499 --> 08:56.135

08:58.772 --> 09:06.772
heads and take part
in a simple meal.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.309
This is a free vegetarian meal

09:37.310 --> 09:38.778
served to many thousands of

09:38.779 --> 09:43.282
visitors from every walk of
life every day of the year.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.450
They serve 16 hours a day?

09:44.451 --> 09:45.618
16 hour a day.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.119
For how many years?

09:46.120 --> 09:49.321
Continuously?

09:49.322 --> 09:49.657
300 years.

09:49.658 --> 09:52.124
300 years.

09:52.125 --> 09:56.362
Everyone doing the cooking,
the serving, the washing of

09:56.363 --> 09:57.529
thousands and thousands of metal

09:57.530 --> 10:05.530
plates and utensils,
are volunteers.

10:06.406 --> 10:14.406
The sound is extraordinary.

10:22.990 --> 10:28.327
We have a feeling that
everyone should serve to other

10:28.328 --> 10:29.196
people free of cost.

10:29.197 --> 10:37.197
Walking me through it
all Tod Tod today.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.672
For a religion so concerned with

10:39.673 --> 10:44.677
tolerance, where does the
tradition come from?

10:44.678 --> 10:48.948
Powerful people,
hard-working people.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.517
Every Sikh you have seen, when

10:51.518 --> 10:54.854
we get baptized, you must
protect yourself, you must

10:54.855 --> 10:56.956
protect others and you must

10:56.957 --> 11:02.896
protect your country so
that makes us what we are.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.721
Morning.

11:28.722 --> 11:32.992
The smoke from countless burning

11:32.993 --> 11:40.993
fields covers the
city in a thick haze.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.625
The ancient art evolved from

12:06.626 --> 12:09.661
Indian wrestling techniques that

12:09.662 --> 12:12.431
date back to the
fifth century B.C.

12:12.432 --> 12:15.434
Ready, start!

12:15.435 --> 12:16.769
Training is rigid.

12:16.770 --> 12:24.770
This is not just a sport,
but a way of life.

12:25.012 --> 12:29.281
Wrestlers live and train
together and have strict rules

12:29.282 --> 12:30.549
of diet and personal conduct.

12:30.550 --> 12:38.550
No smoking, no drinking,
no contact with women.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.006
I took high school wrestling so

12:54.007 --> 12:55.707
that I could get
out of gym class.

12:55.708 --> 13:03.708
I was a dirty, dirty fighter.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.990
It's an all too natural segue

13:10.991 --> 13:15.161
between the aggressive posturing

13:15.162 --> 13:18.898
of opposing bodies and this.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.267
The entire border between India

13:21.268 --> 13:29.268
and Pakistan has
only one crossing.

13:31.711 --> 13:32.212
Here.

13:32.213 --> 13:34.013
Every sunset the border is

13:34.014 --> 13:40.386
officially closed with this
bit of national theater.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.022
Wearing nearly duplicate
uniforms, the Indian military

13:43.023 --> 13:48.861
and Pakistani rangers partake in

13:48.862 --> 13:52.364
a game of theatrical contempt.

13:52.365 --> 14:00.365
Clearly it's a popular show.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.575
So where are we?

14:03.576 --> 14:05.711
We are right next to Pakistan.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.414
India and Pakistan were once

14:08.415 --> 14:10.549
one country, ripped apart in one

14:10.550 --> 14:14.553
of the hastiest, ill-considered
partitions imaginable.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.754
Beyond there, no more fence?

14:15.755 --> 14:16.723
No more fences.

14:16.724 --> 14:19.558
So once you get past there,
you can go straight into

14:19.559 --> 14:21.060
Pakistan if you want?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.895
The problem is, the thing is,

14:22.896 --> 14:26.065
India is trying to stop people

14:26.066 --> 14:29.401
from coming in, infiltrators,
drug dealers, terrorists.

14:29.402 --> 14:34.473
He is working on a
documentary about the

14:34.474 --> 14:35.342
India/Pakistan border.

14:35.343 --> 14:36.842
No one wants to go to Pakistan.

14:36.843 --> 14:37.577
No one wants to?

14:37.578 --> 14:39.946
In their right mind,
to go into Pakistan.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.847
That's a fairly
decisive statement.

14:41.848 --> 14:42.915
So they put up the fence but the

14:42.916 --> 14:44.450
fence is on the Indian side.

14:44.451 --> 14:45.918
Yeah.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.453
It's 115 meters from the border.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.755
So beyond that fence,
still Indian farmland.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.190
Yes.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.292
So people who live over
here can farm over there.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.094
Farm over there.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.829
The Punjab is a fertile region
in an otherwise very dry

14:57.830 --> 14:59.498
country.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.801
This is India's bread basket.

15:02.802 --> 15:06.205
With over a billion people
currently residing in India,

15:06.206 --> 15:10.042
every inch of fertile Punjabi
soil has great value.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.477
These are people who own land

15:11.478 --> 15:13.612
over there, then they put the

15:13.613 --> 15:17.283
fence, suddenly your
life became difficult.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.550
Exactly.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.119
They can only grow some kind of

15:20.120 --> 15:21.787
crops and they can't farm more

15:21.788 --> 15:22.955
than eight hours in a day.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.457
How long does it take
to get back and forth?

15:25.458 --> 15:26.993
The border security force

15:26.994 --> 15:28.027
manage these gates so they have

15:28.028 --> 15:36.028
times when they can
enter and come out.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.572
How much farther can we go
before they start to get

15:40.573 --> 15:44.743
worried?

15:44.744 --> 15:45.645
I think [ Inaudible ].

15:45.646 --> 15:47.646
When India and Pakistan were

15:47.647 --> 15:52.651
separated, the attempt was
to try to draw a line across

15:52.652 --> 15:53.020
religious lines.

15:53.020 --> 15:53.753
Exactly.

15:53.754 --> 15:56.422
Drained by the colossal task

15:56.423 --> 15:58.657
of fighting two world wars, in

15:58.658 --> 15:59.691
1947 Great Britain decided to

15:59.692 --> 16:03.595
end their nearly 200 year rule

16:03.596 --> 16:05.998
over India in an attempt to

16:05.999 --> 16:07.933
prevent an inevitable civil war

16:07.934 --> 16:11.170
between Hindus, Muslims and

16:11.171 --> 16:14.706
Sikhs, the British commissioner
drew up a new border.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.843
He was given two months.

16:17.844 --> 16:21.680
Two months to create a
new country, basically.

16:21.681 --> 16:25.017
People died because
of the displaced men.

16:25.018 --> 16:29.388
Unofficially they say
two million people.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.924
In one of the largest
exchanges of populations in

16:32.925 --> 16:37.363
history, many millions of
people fled their homes.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.598
Almost immediately, religious

16:39.599 --> 16:42.268
violence broke out
on a mass scale.

16:42.269 --> 16:45.271
This is exactly what the
partition had been intended to

16:45.272 --> 16:47.039
avoid.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.308
Do people here still have
families over there?

16:49.309 --> 16:49.909
They do.

16:49.910 --> 16:52.878
When the line was drawn, there

16:52.879 --> 16:54.713
were religious
split into halves.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.082
There are some houses where you

16:56.083 --> 16:58.650
enter from India and
exit from Pakistan.

16:58.651 --> 16:59.885
Really.

16:59.886 --> 17:00.053
Wow.

17:00.054 --> 17:03.622
This part of Punjab and that

17:03.623 --> 17:05.223
part of Punjab were once the

17:05.224 --> 17:08.394
same so the cultures
are very similar.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.096
It's a popular
metaphor for India.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.997
Pakistan is twins
separated at birth.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.065
We were never twins.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.000
It was one country.

17:14.001 --> 17:15.401
You could say dismembered.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.734
If you cut a body in two, they

17:16.736 --> 17:17.569
are not going to become twins.

17:17.570 --> 17:22.641
Right.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.675
It's sad, you know?

17:23.675 --> 17:24.411
You can see them.

17:24.412 --> 17:27.579
They are doing the same
work as you are doing.

17:27.579 --> 17:28.013
They dress the same.

17:28.015 --> 17:34.086
They look the same.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.755
But you can't talk to them.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.691
It is an ongoing struggle, an

17:39.692 --> 17:40.992
enduring cause of paranoia,

17:40.993 --> 17:43.929
visible all across the region.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.765
Two nations with atomic arsenals

17:46.766 --> 17:48.467
who have shown if nothing else,

17:48.468 --> 17:56.468
a terrifying willingness
to use them.

18:17.530 --> 18:21.200
From the horrific 2006 train

18:21.201 --> 18:23.502
bombings to the militant attacks

18:23.503 --> 18:25.337
in Mumbai, the threat of

18:25.338 --> 18:32.111
terrorism along this
border is a daily concern.

18:58.438 --> 19:06.438
♪

19:09.449 --> 19:12.684
Want something good?

19:12.685 --> 19:13.719
Really, really good?

19:13.720 --> 19:17.055
Something local, regional,
iconically wonderful?

19:17.056 --> 19:19.525
You can't say you've had the

19:19.526 --> 19:22.093
whole experience until you've

19:22.094 --> 19:24.196
had a little cocha in your life.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.764
This is the iconic
dish of Punjab.

19:25.765 --> 19:33.765
Yes.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.781
It's a perfect little flavor

19:42.782 --> 19:44.049
bomb of wheat dough pressed

19:44.050 --> 19:46.918
against the side of a very, very

19:46.919 --> 19:49.455
hot Clay oven, slathered with

19:49.456 --> 19:51.790
butter and served with a spicy

19:51.791 --> 19:54.260
chickpea curry on the side.

19:54.261 --> 20:01.567
Did I mention the butter?

20:01.568 --> 20:02.901
How is it?

20:02.902 --> 20:03.836
Delicious.

20:03.837 --> 20:09.408
Everyone seems to be an
expert on the dish, including

20:09.409 --> 20:11.977
this lady.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.345
This is our radish.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.247
Very, very, very good.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.748
Generally speaking, Punjabis are

20:16.749 --> 20:18.450
famous for being
a warrior class.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.518
Taller, bigger.

20:19.519 --> 20:20.253
Yes.

20:20.253 --> 20:20.820
They're big.

20:20.821 --> 20:23.255
Still maybe not fighters
so much but still eaters.

20:23.256 --> 20:23.590
Oh, yeah.

20:23.590 --> 20:23.856
Big-time.

20:23.857 --> 20:26.792
Yes.

20:26.793 --> 20:27.993
The religion doesn't matter.

20:27.994 --> 20:35.994
Food is religion here.

20:49.115 --> 20:57.115
Checking off my list of
things to do in the Punjab, I

20:58.224 --> 21:00.526
got to score some
animal protein.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.394
It's time.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.796
I've been going all Morrisey for

21:04.797 --> 21:07.699
two days now and
frankly, that's enough.

21:07.700 --> 21:15.700
I need chicken.

21:17.977 --> 21:21.347
We are nowhere here.

21:21.348 --> 21:21.648
Where am I?

21:21.649 --> 21:23.749
It's very famous for chicken.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.251
When we are talking must-haves,
tandori chicken is

21:26.252 --> 21:28.987
just that.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.389
I have some lemon in this.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.324
You will enjoy it.

21:31.325 --> 21:34.092
Oh, man, it's delicious.

21:34.093 --> 21:39.598
This type of
establishment, dhaba?

21:39.599 --> 21:42.334
This is the most
successful business here.

21:42.335 --> 21:46.405
Anyone who open a dhaba
tomorrow, it will be like this.

21:46.406 --> 21:49.007
But if you're going to have
chicken it better be good.

21:49.008 --> 21:49.676
Yeah.

21:49.677 --> 21:51.843
Would you like to
have something else?

21:51.844 --> 21:57.516
There's ground mutton?

21:57.517 --> 21:59.518
Mutton ball, dough.

21:59.519 --> 22:06.758
And the special
ingredient, magic hands.

22:06.759 --> 22:10.462
Believe me when I tell
you, this is good.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.763
So good that people snap it up

22:11.764 --> 22:17.369
the second it comes
out of the Tandora.

22:17.370 --> 22:21.272
Hey, that's mine.

22:21.273 --> 22:21.541
Mm.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.208
Is it good?

22:22.208 --> 22:22.575
Sensational.

22:22.576 --> 22:25.711
Wow.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.779
People do love their food.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.982
I love eating.

22:30.983 --> 22:35.286
The movies and television in
this country is fantastic.

22:35.287 --> 22:39.324
I don't even understand
why... what's going on.

22:39.325 --> 22:39.892
Everybody dances and sings.

22:39.893 --> 22:44.295
I don't get it.

23:02.248 --> 23:05.817

So good.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.628
Leaving the fertile plains

23:49.629 --> 23:51.296
of the Punjab behind, I'm headed

23:51.297 --> 23:54.733
out towards the Himalayas.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.167
In getting there, at least the

23:56.168 --> 23:57.302
way I'm going, hasn't changed

23:57.303 --> 24:00.338
much in the last hundred years.

24:00.339 --> 24:08.339
All aboard.

24:14.854 --> 24:20.659
This is going to be
suboptimal seating.

24:20.660 --> 24:21.494
I don't think this reclines.

24:21.495 --> 24:23.862
Thank god they have relaxed

24:23.863 --> 24:25.196
attitudes towards
prescription drugs.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.532
Before you enter the gateway to

24:26.533 --> 24:33.772
the Himalayas, you
better self-medicate.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.006
Meanwhile, I have been like 24

24:35.007 --> 24:37.242
hours without a bite of food.

24:37.243 --> 24:41.446
I arrive, it's like oh,
there's sneaks on the way.

24:41.447 --> 24:41.681
Great.

24:41.682 --> 24:43.348
Get a bag of peanuts.

24:43.349 --> 24:47.853
Truth be told, I'm an angry
bitter man when I board.

24:47.854 --> 24:52.691
I'm guessing there ain't a P.F.

24:52.692 --> 24:53.892
Chang on the way.

24:53.893 --> 24:54.761
So little.

24:54.762 --> 24:56.261
The universal tourist.

24:56.262 --> 24:58.429
You go on the king Kong ride.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.865
While my stomach growls, I

24:59.866 --> 25:05.737
become the kind of traveler
I warn against, gripy,

25:05.738 --> 25:09.608
self-absorbed, immune to my
surroundings.

25:09.609 --> 25:10.209
But as my brightly colored

25:10.209 --> 25:10.877
little train heads up into the

25:10.878 --> 25:12.544
hills from Kalka station, known

25:12.545 --> 25:14.946
as the gateway to the Himalayas,

25:14.947 --> 25:22.947
my world view starts to improve.

25:28.961 --> 25:32.330
The naturally bright colors of

25:32.331 --> 25:36.835
India start to pleasurably
saturate my brain.

25:36.836 --> 25:40.606
The view of the windows,
ridiculously deep valleys,

25:40.607 --> 25:48.607
hundred-year-old Bridges,
it's, well, breath-taking.

25:56.322 --> 26:03.795
My fellow passengers, too,
are irresistibly chargming.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.697
The school kids cheer in unison

26:05.698 --> 26:13.698
every time we pass through
one of the tunnels.

26:24.383 --> 26:26.517
Hip hip hooray!

26:26.518 --> 26:30.789
I had pretty much forgotten
about my hunger until the

26:30.790 --> 26:35.060
whistle stopped.

26:35.061 --> 26:35.862
Two of these.

26:35.863 --> 26:39.631
This place is named for a
colonel, the British engineer

26:39.632 --> 26:43.468
tasked with building the line.

26:43.469 --> 26:45.303
The station and the adjacent

26:45.304 --> 26:47.505
tunnel bearing his name are
rumored to be haunted.

26:47.506 --> 26:55.506
It's delicious.

26:55.648 --> 26:57.548
Already behind schedule and

26:57.549 --> 27:05.549
plagued by cost overruns,
Barog screwed up.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.493
When he realized the two ends of

27:08.494 --> 27:12.998
this tunnel didn't meet in
the middle, he shot himself.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.833
It's the kind of personal

27:14.834 --> 27:16.334
accountability I would like
to see more of, frankly.

27:16.335 --> 27:24.109
Or is that just me?

27:24.110 --> 27:26.712
All my snarkiness fades as one

27:26.713 --> 27:27.713
can't help but reflect on what

27:27.714 --> 27:29.414
it took to dig, drag, blast and

27:29.415 --> 27:32.617
tunnel one's way up this
route back in the day.

27:32.618 --> 27:34.920
Back in the beginning, making

27:34.921 --> 27:36.521
the trip required a somewhat

27:36.522 --> 27:37.588
uncomfortable three-day trek up

27:37.589 --> 27:41.927
the mountain by foot or horse or

27:41.928 --> 27:47.132
hand-carried pelanguin.

27:47.133 --> 27:50.035
The stats are impressive.

27:50.036 --> 27:57.075
The climb of around 5,000 feet,

27:57.076 --> 28:01.713
over 100 tunnels, more than 800

28:01.714 --> 28:03.281
Bridges, an engineering feat, a

28:03.282 --> 28:10.088
job that when you consider
the time, defies imagining.

28:10.089 --> 28:15.060
In the building of this
railroad, many died.

28:15.061 --> 28:19.031
Many, many died.

29:10.883 --> 29:18.389
When you look at that
painting, when you stand out

29:18.390 --> 29:24.362
front of the garden and look out

29:24.363 --> 29:28.566
at the view, can you
picture the way it was?

29:28.567 --> 29:35.040
I have been to many places
where it reminded me of what

29:35.041 --> 29:36.207
it's like to be when the British

29:36.208 --> 29:40.745
came and settled there.

29:40.746 --> 29:47.986
I have ventured to such places.

29:47.987 --> 29:53.859
Fond memories of British rule,
maybe not what you would

29:53.860 --> 29:55.326
expect to hear.

29:55.327 --> 30:00.031
But Reggie's family
was different.

30:00.032 --> 30:04.535
Indian royalty with
palaces, the 1% of the 1%.

30:04.536 --> 30:07.538
So life for Reggie as a young

30:07.539 --> 30:08.706
boy was relative to the millions

30:08.707 --> 30:16.707
and millions of others
his age, enchanted.

30:23.622 --> 30:26.357
Shimla is from a time before
partition, when nearly the

30:26.358 --> 30:29.727
entire ruling class of British
India would move to hill

30:29.728 --> 30:37.728
stations in the hotter months.

30:41.607 --> 30:42.707
Shimla was once known as the

30:42.708 --> 30:45.276
queen of all hill stations.

30:45.277 --> 30:51.449
Here, the colonials created
England in miniature.

30:51.450 --> 30:56.154
Complete with Tudor
architecture, Rose gardens,

30:56.155 --> 30:59.991
afternoon tea.

30:59.992 --> 31:07.992
My grandfather
entertained hugely.

31:08.134 --> 31:16.134
Garden parties, fancy dress
balls, elephant hunts.

31:20.312 --> 31:25.850
The remnants of British
rule can still be seen.

31:25.851 --> 31:30.855
And felt.

31:30.856 --> 31:35.826
This is particularly
true of one house.

31:35.827 --> 31:38.829
Chapsley.

31:38.830 --> 31:41.666
My family was very fortunate

31:41.667 --> 31:44.169
that they were able to buy this

31:44.170 --> 31:45.836
house, because it
was a famous house.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.772
The house was purchased by

31:47.773 --> 31:53.711
Reggie's grandfather,
the last maharajah.

31:53.712 --> 31:58.616
The Brits really left
beautiful buildings.

31:58.617 --> 32:01.852
From a distance, it looks
much the same as it must have

32:01.853 --> 32:09.360
when the maharajah slept here.

32:09.361 --> 32:17.361
Check out the tub.

32:25.877 --> 32:28.879
Locked in a constant battle

32:28.880 --> 32:31.049
against time and nature, barbed

32:31.050 --> 32:32.683
wire does little to keep

32:32.684 --> 32:40.684
Shimla's ever encroaching
monkey population at bay.

32:48.700 --> 32:49.601
Stripped of their wealth and

32:49.602 --> 32:51.936
their kingdoms, the one-time

32:51.937 --> 32:53.504
royals all across India have had

32:53.505 --> 32:55.240
to either sell their estates or

32:55.241 --> 32:57.242
like Reggie, turn them into

32:57.243 --> 33:05.243
hotels and guest houses
in order to hold on.

33:05.551 --> 33:13.091
Ring a buzzer and a
servant appears.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.525
They bring you hot water bottles

33:14.526 --> 33:19.897
at night, put them
under the covers.

33:19.898 --> 33:27.898
Butlers keep popping
in, build a nice fire.

33:28.074 --> 33:34.212
A great facet of my childhood
was how my grandfather

33:34.213 --> 33:34.513
entertained.

33:34.513 --> 33:35.447
His table came to be known as

33:35.448 --> 33:37.782
perhaps the most famous in

33:37.783 --> 33:45.783
northern India because he
was a conoisseur of food.

33:46.458 --> 33:49.294
Tonight, dinner at Chapslee,

33:49.295 --> 33:54.732
an elaborate Anglo-Indian
menu from Reggie's childhood.

33:54.733 --> 34:02.407
I will put on my apron first.

34:02.408 --> 34:06.144
My fellow guests, two
of Reggie's friends.

34:06.145 --> 34:13.083
A historian on the subject
of Shimla and the barrister.

34:13.085 --> 34:14.485
So much history here.

34:14.485 --> 34:17.322
While I take a dim view of

34:17.322 --> 34:18.422
colonialization, it's very hard

34:18.424 --> 34:21.426
to resist the charms
of a house like this.

34:21.427 --> 34:24.429
That's quite
understandable, actually.

34:24.429 --> 34:27.697
You've got 100 years of very,

34:27.699 --> 34:30.467
very intense history funneled
into a very small place.

34:30.469 --> 34:38.469
This house used to house
the secretary of state.

34:40.179 --> 34:48.179
This is eggs Florentine.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.657
Oh, that's good.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.159
This was a small town.

34:54.159 --> 35:00.030
Small town with a very,
very big government.

35:00.031 --> 35:06.737
It has the distinction of

35:06.738 --> 35:07.673
surprisingly, it was the capital

35:07.674 --> 35:08.973
of Burma during the war days.

35:08.974 --> 35:10.675
You have this tiny little

35:10.676 --> 35:11.809
village up on the hill connected

35:11.810 --> 35:16.381
to the rest of the world by a

35:16.382 --> 35:20.518
narrow mountain path and a rule,

35:20.519 --> 35:21.387
approximately a fifth of the

35:21.388 --> 35:22.887
human race for eight
months every year.

35:22.888 --> 35:28.693
In today's context it would
almost seem bizarre.

35:28.694 --> 35:31.596
Mulligitawny soup.

35:31.597 --> 35:33.198
A classic example of what we

35:33.199 --> 35:35.266
think of as Indian food in
the west but not at all.

35:35.267 --> 35:36.834
This was originally a soup made

35:36.835 --> 35:38.436
by Indian chefs to accommodate

35:38.437 --> 35:39.570
British tastes, is that correct?

35:39.571 --> 35:47.345
It was something what you
would call halfway between a

35:47.346 --> 35:53.518
soup and a broth.

35:53.519 --> 36:00.625
Basically, meat cooked
in its own fat.

36:00.626 --> 36:01.959
It's a misnomer.

36:01.960 --> 36:07.865
This meat is not
actually mutton.

36:07.866 --> 36:08.966
Here, back before the rail

36:08.967 --> 36:10.901
line, it would be
a difficult trip.

36:10.902 --> 36:11.136
Yes.

36:11.137 --> 36:14.104
But once they were up and
running, there were many

36:14.105 --> 36:15.606
servants to look after
your every need.

36:15.607 --> 36:20.278
You had a fireplace, a
hearth in every room.

36:20.279 --> 36:28.279
And people on the regular
payroll whose only job was to

36:30.922 --> 36:35.626
Is this man would go on the

36:35.627 --> 36:40.298
ground and the common
folk would get real.

36:40.299 --> 36:42.099
Normally they would not supposed

36:42.100 --> 36:43.301
to look in the direction.

36:43.302 --> 36:43.735
It was bad manners.

36:43.736 --> 36:45.303
Right.

36:45.304 --> 36:49.974
It wasn't easy for the
people who built it.

36:49.975 --> 36:52.142
It was India that paid the bill

36:52.143 --> 36:58.816
for all this grandeur
for all this show.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.985
They did it at our expense
and with our money.

37:00.986 --> 37:03.854
At the end of the meal,
there's coffee, Brandy and

37:03.855 --> 37:04.975
cigars in the sitting radio.

37:06.292 --> 37:14.292
As one does, or once did.

37:17.202 --> 37:22.172
Did you enjoy your time?

37:22.173 --> 37:23.108
Very much so.

37:23.109 --> 37:27.945
A lot of his are in this house.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.647
And one can be forgiven for

37:29.648 --> 37:31.682
briefly forgetting what it took

37:31.683 --> 37:37.522
to build this lost kingdom.

37:37.523 --> 37:43.429
And how much the world
has changed around it.

38:07.719 --> 38:13.057
The monkey temple is
overrun by its namesakes.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.426
Twisting up further into the

38:15.427 --> 38:16.395
Himalayas, I find myself at a

38:16.396 --> 38:19.864
place known as the
land of the gods.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.098
Nearly every village credited

38:21.099 --> 38:29.099
with having its own deity.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.842
Getting there, you might well

38:31.843 --> 38:34.011
have an opportunity to
meet one of those deities.

38:34.012 --> 38:36.046
As you tear around narrow

38:36.047 --> 38:39.016
guardrail free mountain roads,

38:39.017 --> 38:43.588
overlooking terrifying dropoffs.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.356
I can do heights.

38:45.357 --> 38:48.426
I've done a number of jumping

38:48.427 --> 38:51.529
out of the planes a
number of times.

38:51.530 --> 38:56.401
But looking over precipices
like that one, ew.

38:56.402 --> 39:02.206
If my knees could vomit
with terror, they would be.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.442
They would be vomiting
with terror right now.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.777
They should have little
underwear stops on this road

39:06.778 --> 39:08.045
where you can get a fresh pair.

39:08.046 --> 39:14.952
Every couple of miles it's
like oh, that was scary.

39:14.953 --> 39:18.222
Overloaded buses, water trucks

39:18.223 --> 39:21.392
with brake pads, aggressive
truck drivers come whaling

39:21.393 --> 39:22.927
around the corner at anytime.

39:22.928 --> 39:25.963
And they do.

39:25.964 --> 39:26.932
About every two minutes.

39:26.933 --> 39:34.933
Squeeze your cheeks tight
and close your eyes.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.579
The remote locations of these

39:41.580 --> 39:46.584
isolated mountain villages have

39:46.585 --> 39:49.987
kept old traditions alive.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.757
Villa village fairs serve as an

39:52.758 --> 39:55.860
opportunity for families who
live very far apart to get

39:55.861 --> 39:59.163
together, play game, eat and

39:59.164 --> 40:06.170
participate in religious rites
honoring local deities.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.638
Quite a ride getting here.

40:07.639 --> 40:08.106
Yeah.

40:08.107 --> 40:09.440
How did you enjoy that road?

40:09.441 --> 40:12.042
White knuckles.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.944
Meet Hashim.

40:13.945 --> 40:21.945
He runs motorcycle tours
through these parts.

40:23.154 --> 40:28.493
You're traveling almost 1,000
kilometers on the trip.

40:28.494 --> 40:30.995
So vegetable curry?

40:30.996 --> 40:35.466
Yogurt based curry, quite
typical in these parts.

40:35.467 --> 40:36.134
Vegetables again?

40:36.135 --> 40:38.869
Surprisingly, not a problem.

40:38.870 --> 40:39.738
That's good, huh?

40:39.739 --> 40:41.138
This is one of the few places in

40:41.139 --> 40:42.473
the world I could eat vegetarian

40:42.474 --> 40:44.408
every day and still be happy.

40:44.409 --> 40:46.811
Most of the people in this
community are farmers?

40:46.812 --> 40:48.145
Farmers.

40:48.146 --> 40:49.246
Agricultural?

40:49.247 --> 40:49.681
Yeah.

40:49.682 --> 40:50.715
What are they growing?

40:50.716 --> 40:55.185
A lot of corn, potatoes, peas.

40:55.186 --> 40:58.355
And weed.

40:58.356 --> 41:00.257
People grow marijuana?

41:00.258 --> 41:01.258
Yes, loads.

41:01.259 --> 41:01.893
For export or personal use?

41:01.893 --> 41:02.494
Everything.

41:02.495 --> 41:04.562
A mix of everything.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.931
So you think you want to
go check out the fair?

41:06.932 --> 41:08.966
Yeah, let's take a walk through
town, see what's going

41:08.967 --> 41:14.338
on.

41:14.339 --> 41:20.344
Families come together
and socialize.

41:20.345 --> 41:20.979
People are busy in their farms.

41:20.979 --> 41:21.713
They're not going to walk down

41:21.714 --> 41:24.014
and socialize with people.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.584
But this, you know, because it's

41:26.585 --> 41:28.886
Autumn, everyone is done
with all the agriculture.

41:28.887 --> 41:31.956
Now they're just baring
down for winter.

41:31.957 --> 41:37.862
A lot of romance in the air.

41:37.863 --> 41:45.863
I've been to Mumbai, this is

41:46.371 --> 41:49.373
a part of India that's
different than any other part.

41:49.374 --> 41:57.374
It's fascinating and beautiful.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.117
Oh, yeah.

42:00.118 --> 42:08.118
Sweet.

42:08.727 --> 42:16.667

42:16.668 --> 42:24.668
