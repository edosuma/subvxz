One, two, three...

00:50.386 --> 00:52.257
...four, five...

01:06.007 --> 01:08.977
...eight, nine, ten...

01:28.996 --> 01:32.354
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen...

01:32.434 --> 01:35.289
...eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

01:35.369 --> 01:37.182
Ready or not...

01:42.809 --> 01:44.623
...here I come.

02:24.386 --> 02:25.965
Hello?

03:00.755 --> 03:02.302
Janie?

03:04.525 --> 03:06.105
Janie?

03:09.764 --> 03:11.643
Who's there?

03:31.019 --> 03:32.899
<i>Where is Janie?</i>

03:43.865 --> 03:46.502
It was so quiet, why so quiet... too quiet.

03:59.713 --> 04:01.665
What goes on behind those eyes?

04:15.095 --> 04:16.750
No!

04:37.718 --> 04:40.173
<i>Why wouldn't they see? See?</i>

04:40.253 --> 04:43.910
<i>Why wouldn't they see? Always seeing.
Something I heard in a dream.</i>

04:49.179 --> 04:50.727
<i>Janie?</i>

04:55.569 --> 04:57.383
<i>I couldn't find her.</i>

05:07.814 --> 05:09.828
<i>She said it was an accident.</i>

05:45.185 --> 05:47.274
I need it. I need it!

05:47.354 --> 05:49.042
God, stop.

05:49.122 --> 05:52.213
- Okay, fine.
- Oh! That's horrible, oh, no.

05:52.293 --> 05:54.648
Oh, orange, definitely your color,
I would say.

05:54.728 --> 05:57.984
Oh, hey, no, this is actually
not bad, though.

05:58.064 --> 06:02.369
Hm? Splatter some blood on it,
get some big glasses, bam! Zombie hipster.

06:02.449 --> 06:03.961
Or...

06:04.966 --> 06:07.002
- ...trucker zombie.
- Stop.

06:09.197 --> 06:11.766
Sam! Sam, can I get this?

06:12.756 --> 06:14.502
What do you want that for?

06:14.582 --> 06:17.503
For my costume, I'm going as a fairy queen.

06:17.583 --> 06:19.464
Cool, squirt.

06:20.454 --> 06:22.342
What are you guys' costumes?

06:22.422 --> 06:24.711
- Zombies.
- I don't like zombies.

06:24.791 --> 06:28.319
Well, you know what they like?
Delicious, little, girl brains.

06:28.399 --> 06:30.218
Knock it off.

06:30.698 --> 06:33.219
Cathy said this party is gonna be so crazy.

06:34.767 --> 06:36.123
What party?

06:36.203 --> 06:38.960
The two of us are gonna
hang out on Halloween.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.205
But I thought we were gonna go
trick-or-treating?

06:44.411 --> 06:47.390
Hey! You said you'd help me with my costume.

06:47.470 --> 06:49.758
Sam, hey.

06:50.184 --> 06:53.006
Logan, uh...

06:53.286 --> 06:55.977
Yeah, I actually got those notes
that you wanted.

06:56.057 --> 06:57.612
Oh.

06:57.992 --> 07:01.222
So, um, what are you guys doing?
Just looking for Halloween stuff?

07:01.302 --> 07:05.285
- We're actually...
- Yeah, we're gonna go try some stuff on.

07:05.365 --> 07:09.112
Uh, could you watch Olivia?
That'd be great, thanks.

07:30.725 --> 07:32.552
Hey, Sam...

07:32.809 --> 07:37.419
...so, um, are you going to that Halloween
thing at school, you know, the dance?

07:38.199 --> 07:41.711
- Ooh! What's her problem?
- What the hell was that?

07:41.791 --> 07:44.702
She is crazy. My mom went to school with her.

07:44.782 --> 07:48.796
She tried to burn her own house
down... with her family in it.

07:48.876 --> 07:50.422
Jeez.

07:52.987 --> 07:54.827
Why would she do that?

08:11.332 --> 08:13.546
Yeah, like that, okay.

08:19.573 --> 08:22.269
Oh, nice! Yeah.

08:30.016 --> 08:33.506
Thank you, Lord, for this food.
Bless our family and keep us safe.

08:33.586 --> 08:35.100
Amen.

08:38.591 --> 08:40.395
Your phone stop working?

08:41.861 --> 08:44.684
That's the only reason I can think
that you'd be this late.

08:44.764 --> 08:48.521
- Garrett, can we just...
- And you let Olivia walk home alone!

08:48.601 --> 08:53.354
- We've talked about this before, Sam.
- Yeah, but she doesn't care. Right, squirt?

08:53.434 --> 08:56.530
Sam, you can't just pick and choose
which of the rules you want to follow!

08:56.610 --> 08:57.966
Okay.

08:58.446 --> 09:01.852
What? I'm not wrong, am I?
She wants to be part of this family.

09:13.194 --> 09:14.774
Dinner?

09:19.432 --> 09:21.175
She's ten...

09:21.555 --> 09:24.216
...I mean, I walked home
from school when I was ten.

09:24.870 --> 09:27.320
Did a lot of things on my own when I was ten.

09:34.882 --> 09:37.695
You realize there's a dresser here.

09:38.984 --> 09:41.825
- Mm-hm.
- You could put up some posters.

09:42.855 --> 09:46.080
We can get some new paint. You, me
and Olivia could have a paint party.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.046
It's fine... the way it is.

09:49.796 --> 09:53.987
You know, Garrett and I
have been talking about you.

09:54.067 --> 09:55.990
About how much I suck?

09:56.070 --> 09:58.507
About making you a part of this family...

10:00.536 --> 10:02.394
...permanently.

10:06.279 --> 10:08.327
We all want you here.

10:11.952 --> 10:13.965
I made you something.

10:17.858 --> 10:21.776
Is that supposed to be me?
I don't think you drew me grumpy enough.

10:21.856 --> 10:25.645
You weren't allowed to be grumpy
in this picture, we're flying.

10:28.201 --> 10:30.824
- Thanks, squirt.
- Your welcome.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.573
Do you want to get out of here and blaze?

10:51.191 --> 10:54.406
Hey, squirt, are you okay
to walk the rest of the way home?

10:55.628 --> 10:58.911
- Yeah.
- Cool, see you there.

11:21.322 --> 11:23.810
I went by our old street the other day.

11:24.390 --> 11:26.204
Your house is still there.

11:29.063 --> 11:32.924
Should tear it down or burn it.

11:34.335 --> 11:35.848
Sorry.

11:38.004 --> 11:39.818
At least we met, right?

11:45.011 --> 11:47.026
And what would I do without you?

11:52.752 --> 11:55.834
You'd smoke sloppy-ass joints, obviously.

12:09.369 --> 12:10.916
Olivia!

12:12.001 --> 12:13.897
I'm home!

12:31.357 --> 12:32.938
Olivia?

12:49.742 --> 12:51.324
Olivia?

12:59.051 --> 13:00.632
Olivia!

13:08.094 --> 13:09.608
Olivia!

13:53.073 --> 13:55.171
And that was the last time you saw her?

14:01.715 --> 14:04.196
You think of anything else, you let me know.

14:10.423 --> 14:11.779
Garrett...

14:11.859 --> 14:14.448
I don't want to hear from you,
you understand me?

14:14.528 --> 14:16.449
You did this to her.

14:24.471 --> 14:26.034
Olivia!

14:28.008 --> 14:29.585
Olivia!

14:37.751 --> 14:40.116
Honey, it's Mama and Daddy!

14:40.321 --> 14:41.901
Olivia!

14:46.259 --> 14:47.503
Olivia!

14:51.098 --> 14:52.711
Olivia!

14:56.953 --> 14:59.426
I don't understand this.
Why do you keep defending her?

14:59.506 --> 15:02.229
Can we just please focus on Olivia right now?

15:02.309 --> 15:05.431
I don't wanna talk about Sam,
she's just a messed up kid.

15:05.511 --> 15:08.569
She is messed up, but this is
about Olivia, do you understand me?

15:08.649 --> 15:11.350
Just cause she's messed up, that doesn't
excuse Sam for what's going on here...

15:11.430 --> 15:15.441
...you gotta understand, you're not
going to help her, you can't help Sam.

15:15.521 --> 15:19.278
Fine! What if my parents
had just given up on me?

15:19.358 --> 15:21.606
Liz, Sam is not you.

16:03.836 --> 16:06.252
You going to stay out here all night again?

16:12.479 --> 16:14.694
I'd kill for a cigarette right now.

16:15.982 --> 16:17.829
You smoke?

16:21.721 --> 16:24.001
I gave it up before we had Olivia.

16:25.524 --> 16:27.772
Gave a lot of things up around then.

16:34.700 --> 16:38.007
When my parents adopted me,
they were so strong for me...

16:38.087 --> 16:39.933
...when I needed the most.

16:41.841 --> 16:44.688
You go through it, you do the work...

16:45.645 --> 16:48.126
...and you think you're ready for this life.

16:51.018 --> 16:55.051
That you can be that strong in the face
of whatever the world throws at you.

16:58.859 --> 17:00.673
Pray with me, Sam.

17:10.236 --> 17:14.031
Heavenly Father,
please bring Olivia back to us.

17:14.112 --> 17:16.337
Please shield her from harm.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.468
She's my baby.

17:20.280 --> 17:22.494
Why weren't you there for her?

17:27.954 --> 17:29.835
I'm sorry.

17:52.644 --> 17:54.668
<i>Pray with me, Sam.</i>

17:55.648 --> 17:58.892
<i>Please just send Olivia back to us.</i>

17:59.352 --> 18:01.773
<i>Shield her from harm.</i>

18:04.491 --> 18:08.307
<i>Why weren't you there for me?</i>

18:30.250 --> 18:31.677
Olivia?

18:35.721 --> 18:37.229
Olivia!

18:37.309 --> 18:40.210
Oh, my God! Liz. Liz! Garrett!

18:43.563 --> 18:45.394
Are you okay?

18:45.722 --> 18:48.375
I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry...

18:48.801 --> 18:51.267
Oh, my God. Olivia? Olivia.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.933
Olivia. Oh, my God!

18:54.013 --> 18:56.664
- Oh, there you are!
- Where am I?

18:56.744 --> 19:00.170
- Olivia, baby! Oh, baby!
- Where am I?

19:01.547 --> 19:03.394
You're home!

19:06.486 --> 19:08.608
No, she's fine, really.

19:09.188 --> 19:11.791
Just a little dehydrated the doctor said.

19:12.926 --> 19:15.495
Yes, I know, we're so relieved.

19:19.166 --> 19:21.394
Hey, Sam, can you take that out for me?

19:26.973 --> 19:29.513
Don't think things are okay,
just because she's back.

19:29.593 --> 19:32.245
Liz trusts you, but I don't.

19:34.078 --> 19:36.683
- But I'm gonna be different...
- Give me an excuse.

19:38.385 --> 19:41.632
If it were up to me,
you'd be right back in the group home.

21:00.299 --> 21:03.346
Olivia? Is everything okay?

21:07.340 --> 21:09.188
Are you cold?

21:20.352 --> 21:22.433
Did you have a nightmare?

21:25.192 --> 21:27.048
I couldn't sleep, either.

21:28.028 --> 21:29.850
Weird dreams.

21:30.530 --> 21:32.410
I wasn't sleeping.

21:37.003 --> 21:39.251
What happened to you out there, squirt?

21:42.108 --> 21:43.955
I was lost.

21:47.513 --> 21:49.630
But you don't remember...

21:50.702 --> 21:52.411
...anything? I mean...

21:53.094 --> 21:55.154
...I mean, was there anyone with you...

21:56.434 --> 21:58.435
...when you were out there?

21:58.924 --> 22:02.153
I remember the trees and the wind.

22:08.668 --> 22:10.894
Just now I thought I heard singing.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.420
Weird, huh?

22:18.811 --> 22:20.659
Let's go to bed, okay?

22:33.560 --> 22:35.574
Look what I made.

22:38.030 --> 22:39.844
It's for your costume.

22:44.753 --> 22:46.588
Glad you're back.

22:53.680 --> 22:57.044
Don't! I like the sound the wind makes.

23:00.319 --> 23:02.199
Night, squirt.

23:15.167 --> 23:16.481
You.

23:19.671 --> 23:21.565
She's not what she seems.

23:22.633 --> 23:24.397
She's dangerous.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.338
Hey!

23:31.952 --> 23:33.765
Let's go.

23:37.389 --> 23:40.854
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

23:41.293 --> 23:42.707
Amen.

23:43.930 --> 23:46.119
Amen. Goodnight, monkey.

23:46.199 --> 23:48.078
Night, Mom.

24:12.591 --> 24:15.181
Garrett's working late tonight,
and I have to do a split shift.

24:15.261 --> 24:17.350
I need you to watch Olivia.

24:18.230 --> 24:22.054
Liz, seriously? Come on,
it's Halloween! I have plans!

24:22.134 --> 24:25.698
I know, I'm sorry, I promise
I'll make it up to you, okay?

24:25.778 --> 24:28.028
Please, Sam, for me?

24:29.108 --> 24:30.454
Whatever.

24:32.178 --> 24:34.455
Don't you understand I'm on your side?

24:35.281 --> 24:38.504
I can't keep sticking up for you
if you keep sabotaging me like this.

24:38.584 --> 24:41.206
I want so much to see you succeed.

24:41.736 --> 24:43.813
I want you to be proud of yourself.

24:45.023 --> 24:47.438
I love the heck out of you, Sam.

24:55.667 --> 24:59.084
Hey, there you are.
So what's the plan for tonight?

25:01.573 --> 25:04.596
Um, we can go to my place
and we can get our drink on...

25:04.676 --> 25:07.358
...because I stole some beers from my dad.

25:08.380 --> 25:09.753
I can't go.

25:14.821 --> 25:16.406
Sam...

25:17.594 --> 25:19.787
...this is such bullshit!

25:20.859 --> 25:24.643
- Can't you just sneak out?
- I really need to be different.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.890
What's that supposed to mean?

25:30.470 --> 25:32.298
I think I have a shot...

25:34.766 --> 25:36.615
...at something real.

25:39.611 --> 25:41.426
I have to try.

25:44.084 --> 25:47.168
Sam, I'm the only person
who's always been there for you.

25:50.556 --> 25:54.213
No matter how much you pretend,
they're never gonna be your real family.

25:58.898 --> 26:00.532
Not now, Logan.

26:01.332 --> 26:04.941
So, I guess there's no point in
asking you to the dance, is there?

26:09.474 --> 26:10.988
Here.

26:39.605 --> 26:41.128
Olivia?

26:41.608 --> 26:44.730
Olivia, what is the matter with you?

26:44.810 --> 26:47.624
- I'm just playing.
- Being mean...

26:48.205 --> 26:50.278
...isn't playing, okay?

26:50.878 --> 26:52.438
It's dinnertime.

26:52.784 --> 26:54.598
Come on, okay?

27:13.705 --> 27:17.803
- Trick or treat!
- Hey, take it. Go.

27:18.578 --> 27:22.204
What are you, a skeleton? Thanks, guys, bye.

27:26.619 --> 27:28.474
Are we going out?

27:29.254 --> 27:31.502
Liz wants us to stay home.

27:32.921 --> 27:34.818
But I want to!

27:34.898 --> 27:37.675
We could play a game.

27:38.965 --> 27:41.113
- Hide and seek?
- I'm hiding first!

27:41.193 --> 27:45.592
45, 46, 47...

27:45.672 --> 27:49.954
...48, 49, 50!

29:24.970 --> 29:26.497
Olivia.

29:44.457 --> 29:46.304
That's enough, okay?

29:48.727 --> 29:50.541
I'm not playing anymore!

30:05.610 --> 30:07.124
Olivia?

30:09.748 --> 30:13.230
Olivia, no hiding outside. That is the rule.

30:19.692 --> 30:21.573
This isn't funny.

30:26.633 --> 30:29.447
<i>You can't find me.</i>

30:39.211 --> 30:40.725
Olivia!

30:55.895 --> 30:57.409
Hello?

31:02.234 --> 31:04.082
Are you okay?

31:27.660 --> 31:29.265
I win.

31:30.395 --> 31:32.136
That's not funny...

31:32.216 --> 31:34.517
...after everything that happened.

31:35.033 --> 31:37.315
Just get inside, it's time for bed.

31:40.305 --> 31:41.952
Go.

32:16.609 --> 32:19.490
Jesus! Sorry.

32:20.713 --> 32:23.102
You know, you can get
your own notes from now on...

32:23.182 --> 32:27.277
...or copy off of someone else.
Because I'm not doing it anymore.

32:28.420 --> 32:29.900
Is that cool?

32:36.395 --> 32:38.276
How was the dance?

32:41.366 --> 32:43.188
I didn't go.

32:43.468 --> 32:45.826
You went on and on about it for weeks.

32:47.206 --> 32:49.544
Probably would've sucked anyways, so...

32:49.624 --> 32:51.742
But it could have been okay...

32:51.822 --> 32:54.223
...and now you'll never know.

33:08.761 --> 33:11.049
You haven't seen Indy, have you?

33:11.129 --> 33:14.019
The other day, Olivia was bugging him.

33:14.099 --> 33:16.556
Why, what happened?

33:16.636 --> 33:20.693
Got out of the yard apparently.
They haven't seen him since Halloween.

33:20.773 --> 33:22.528
Sucks.

33:22.608 --> 33:24.329
Don't forget to trim the hedges, all right?

33:26.411 --> 33:29.316
Sam, would you say grace?

33:31.523 --> 33:33.396
Come on, Sam.

33:38.057 --> 33:40.542
Dear God, thanks for the food.

33:50.735 --> 33:52.620
And thanks for all of us.

33:53.538 --> 33:55.185
Amen.

33:58.878 --> 34:00.399
Hey, quit it!

34:00.479 --> 34:03.493
- Knock it off.
- She's the one that just kicked me!

34:03.573 --> 34:06.264
I don't care. Stop it.

34:25.737 --> 34:27.547
Have you...

34:27.944 --> 34:31.621
...noticed anything weird about
Olivia since she's been back?

34:34.413 --> 34:36.259
She went through a lot, Sam.

34:37.949 --> 34:40.500
Did she say what happened to her out there?

34:44.239 --> 34:46.511
She'll talk about it when she's ready.

34:56.536 --> 34:58.590
You have noticed, haven't you?

34:59.370 --> 35:01.177
She's back...

35:01.257 --> 35:03.058
...that's enough.

35:35.140 --> 35:36.987
What do you want?

35:49.020 --> 35:51.776
What makes you think she did something
to the neighbor's dog?

35:51.856 --> 35:55.614
Well, the dog had been acting really weird
around her and now it's missing.

35:55.694 --> 35:58.918
So? I mean, that doesn't mean
she did something to it.

35:58.998 --> 36:01.079
Well, that doesn't mean she didn't.

36:05.972 --> 36:07.121
Sam...

36:08.081 --> 36:11.245
...Olivia's just acting weird
because of what happened.

36:11.810 --> 36:14.425
You just need to give it some time.

36:27.927 --> 36:31.731
Do you remember that empty lot
at the end of Caffey?

36:33.031 --> 36:35.656
The one with the giant pile of woodchips.

36:37.136 --> 36:40.474
We would spend all night climbing
up and down that thing...

36:40.554 --> 36:42.652
...pretending it was a castle.

36:44.709 --> 36:47.565
Yeah, your dad always let us
stay out so late.

36:48.280 --> 36:50.670
He only let us do that
because he didn't want us around...

36:50.750 --> 36:52.937
...when he had his lady friends there.

36:54.786 --> 36:57.233
Well, I remember...

36:57.713 --> 37:00.314
...sitting on top of that thing...

37:01.132 --> 37:04.178
...listening to the cars
passing on the highway.

37:05.597 --> 37:09.120
Talking about how good
everything was gonna be...

37:09.200 --> 37:10.999
...when we got out of there.

37:13.606 --> 37:16.353
Away from our shitty parents.

37:18.310 --> 37:20.358
You got away from yours.

37:24.582 --> 37:26.168
Sam...

37:26.640 --> 37:28.449
...I didn't mean it.

37:31.506 --> 37:33.370
No, I know.

37:41.032 --> 37:43.080
At least we have each other, right?

37:55.380 --> 37:56.869
Em...

37:56.949 --> 37:58.797
Hey, I'm sorry.

38:12.797 --> 38:14.611
I should probably go.

38:41.393 --> 38:42.940
Hello?

38:49.268 --> 38:51.149
You scared me.

38:52.738 --> 38:54.819
What are you doing out here?

38:56.776 --> 38:58.823
I saw you before, right?

39:00.578 --> 39:02.402
Are you lost?

39:02.882 --> 39:05.129
Do you want me to take you home?

39:07.453 --> 39:10.472
Hey! Hey, hey! Wait. What...

39:10.552 --> 39:12.353
...where are you going?

39:52.864 --> 39:54.454
Garrett?

39:56.487 --> 39:58.075
Garrett?

40:02.541 --> 40:04.397
He was right here.

40:05.850 --> 40:09.660
I swear. I swear I saw him, okay?
His eyes were missing.

40:13.451 --> 40:15.206
Christ.

40:15.286 --> 40:17.776
I gotta work in three hours, you know that?

40:18.656 --> 40:21.117
Something must've moved him.

40:21.197 --> 40:22.998
You have to believe me.

40:23.662 --> 40:26.910
Yeah, what were you doing walking
around in the woods at this hour, huh?

40:29.500 --> 40:31.782
I don't understand you, Samantha.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.855
What's going on?

40:47.253 --> 40:49.103
All right, look...

40:50.627 --> 40:53.284
...let's just go...
let's go home, all right? Let's...

40:53.893 --> 40:56.936
Let's get some sleep, okay? Come on.

41:05.270 --> 41:08.804
- Hey, you seen Olivia?
- Uh, I think she's out back with her mom.

41:08.884 --> 41:10.243
Why?

41:10.323 --> 41:12.188
No reason.

42:14.672 --> 42:16.519
This is mine.

42:18.444 --> 42:19.927
I just wanted it back.

43:02.753 --> 43:05.310
<i>Hey, uh, Logan, this is really weird...</i>

43:05.390 --> 43:09.248
...but do you remember the name of that
crazy lady that we saw at the thrift shop?

43:09.328 --> 43:11.683
<i>Who? Alison Marcus?</i>

43:11.763 --> 43:13.584
I don't know, that's why I called you.

43:13.664 --> 43:16.356
<i>Yeah, yeah, it's Alison Marcus.</i>

43:17.036 --> 43:20.659
<i>Yeah, my mum went to school with her.
She tried to burn her house down.</i>

43:21.339 --> 43:23.214
<i>Why do you want to know?</i>

43:24.830 --> 43:26.413
<i>Sam?</i>

43:28.992 --> 43:31.664
Yeah, I'm gonna see you tomorrow.

43:31.744 --> 43:33.329
Thanks.

43:44.228 --> 43:47.221
You know, running laps should be outlawed.

43:47.331 --> 43:50.180
I'm pretty sure it breaks
the Geneva Convention.

43:52.638 --> 43:55.688
Sam, wait, slow down. Slow down.

43:59.377 --> 44:01.217
What's wrong with you?

44:01.457 --> 44:04.261
Did you know Alison Marcus
had a sister named Janie?

44:05.050 --> 44:09.375
She disappeared in the woods, just like
Olivia and then came back a few days later.

44:10.255 --> 44:13.576
- So?
- So when Alison set fire to her house...

44:14.826 --> 44:18.917
...she told the police it was because of
an imposter, some sort of forest creature.

44:19.797 --> 44:22.087
She knows what happened to Olivia.

44:22.467 --> 44:25.289
Logan, Sam, hurry up...

44:25.369 --> 44:27.854
...this isn't a world's slowest competition!

44:30.609 --> 44:33.897
I need you to cover for me.
Alison lives near here, okay?

44:35.780 --> 44:36.861
Thanks!

44:58.937 --> 45:00.966
Logan, what...

45:04.743 --> 45:06.632
Alison?

45:06.712 --> 45:08.193
What do you want?

45:08.273 --> 45:10.405
I want to talk to you about your sister...

45:10.485 --> 45:11.926
...Janie.

45:13.252 --> 45:16.121
She's dead. She died a long time ago.

45:17.122 --> 45:21.164
When you saw my sister, Olivia, downtown
you said she wasn't what she seemed...

45:22.646 --> 45:24.508
...and I think you're right.

45:26.797 --> 45:28.887
- I'm sorry.
- No, please.

45:29.667 --> 45:31.737
I don't know what else to do.

45:33.221 --> 45:35.091
No one will believe me.

45:49.187 --> 45:51.472
I read about your sister.

45:51.552 --> 45:53.553
She disappeared too, didn't she?

45:55.661 --> 45:57.516
She wasn't the first.

45:58.696 --> 46:01.729
Children have been disappearing
into these woods for decades.

46:05.503 --> 46:06.855
Charles McNabb.

46:09.116 --> 46:11.209
Percy and June Frazier.

46:11.289 --> 46:15.177
A little girl named Amanda Sutherland
got up in the middle of the night...

46:15.257 --> 46:17.536
...and walked into the woods.

46:17.616 --> 46:21.930
She told her mother she'd heard singing
coming from the forest behind their house.

46:22.320 --> 46:24.410
Four days later she's back.

46:25.050 --> 46:27.684
And these are just the ones
I could find records for.

46:30.194 --> 46:31.774
What are they?

46:39.438 --> 46:41.259
The Hollow Ones.

46:42.139 --> 46:44.963
They're watching, always watching...

46:45.843 --> 46:48.615
...from the shadows, from the woods...

46:48.695 --> 46:49.906
...waiting.

46:50.615 --> 46:53.633
They hate us. Hate what we have.

46:54.353 --> 46:58.009
- Everything they're denied by their nature.
- What do you mean, their nature?

46:59.089 --> 47:02.008
Without their disguise,
it hurts them to be seen.

47:03.110 --> 47:05.351
They have to hide their true form.

47:05.891 --> 47:08.167
At least, that's what the folklore says.

47:08.966 --> 47:12.982
And the only way to break their disguise
is to free those they have taken.

47:15.472 --> 47:19.663
This is crazy. I mean, you don't
actually believe any of this, do you?

47:19.743 --> 47:22.433
You don't know! You haven't seen them!

47:22.513 --> 47:25.995
Neither have you! You just said so
and you burned your house down!

47:35.327 --> 47:38.540
And out she walked without a singe on her.

47:39.498 --> 47:41.979
The fire never even touched her.

47:44.099 --> 47:47.660
And she looked at me and laughed...

47:48.711 --> 47:50.934
...so soft and sweet...

47:52.377 --> 47:54.758
...the most awful sound I ever heard.

47:56.280 --> 48:00.977
What happens to the people they take?
What happens to them, Alison?

48:04.889 --> 48:06.403
Alison!

48:08.460 --> 48:09.931
I told her.

48:11.112 --> 48:13.523
I told her not to go into the forest.

48:14.432 --> 48:16.312
I had a bad feeling.

48:19.236 --> 48:23.493
Their lives are ground-down,
day-by-day, minute-by-minute...

48:23.573 --> 48:27.729
...lived out by those things,
while they waste away into nothing...

48:27.809 --> 48:30.267
...in strange halls deep beneath the earth...

48:30.347 --> 48:33.243
- ...their souls are trapped.
- I've seen her.

48:33.931 --> 48:35.859
I've seen her in the woods.

48:38.188 --> 48:40.849
- My sister is dead.
- No, no.

48:41.191 --> 48:43.047
This is her.

48:44.027 --> 48:46.387
- You said their souls were trapped...
- She's gone!

48:51.402 --> 48:53.208
You'll never find her.

48:54.772 --> 48:57.826
The path is secret, it's hidden.

48:57.907 --> 49:00.984
Only their eyes can see it. Run away.

49:02.480 --> 49:04.335
That's your only hope.

49:05.115 --> 49:07.358
Run before it turns everyone against you.

49:17.227 --> 49:18.674
Sam.

49:20.732 --> 49:22.621
I know.

49:22.801 --> 49:24.644
I sound just like her.

49:26.036 --> 49:28.159
I don't expect you to believe me...

49:29.139 --> 49:30.942
...but I know she's out there.

49:36.314 --> 49:38.161
Thanks for coming with me.

49:40.719 --> 49:43.000
You wanna take a walk in the woods?

50:01.071 --> 50:03.127
So what are we actually looking for?

50:03.607 --> 50:06.183
Alison said something about
halls beneath the earth...

50:06.263 --> 50:09.744
...so like a cave or something.

50:11.248 --> 50:13.062
Well, that should be easy.

50:15.285 --> 50:17.133
Keep looking, okay?

50:56.127 --> 50:58.008
This isn't getting us anywhere.

51:00.565 --> 51:04.999
Maybe there's a trick to it. Like,
you know, walking backwards or something.

51:05.636 --> 51:08.392
I don't know,
it's just something I read in a book.

51:08.472 --> 51:10.287
Maybe Alison was right.

51:16.581 --> 51:18.402
She's not.

51:18.482 --> 51:20.906
Come on, two smart cookies like us?

51:21.756 --> 51:23.675
We'll figure it out.

51:26.790 --> 51:28.638
Thanks, Logan.

51:38.837 --> 51:40.650
I, um...

51:46.210 --> 51:48.058
You should just go home.

51:50.281 --> 51:53.250
No, look, I wanted to help. It's just...

51:53.830 --> 51:56.064
...I thought that if I did that...

51:58.522 --> 52:01.472
Go home, Logan.

52:32.990 --> 52:35.651
You're Janie, aren't you?

52:37.695 --> 52:39.743
I saw your picture at Alison's.

52:42.601 --> 52:45.017
There has to be a way I can find Olivia...

52:45.478 --> 52:47.458
...something I can do.

52:50.742 --> 52:53.573
I don't understand, okay? What do you want?

52:54.979 --> 52:56.826
Say something!

52:59.017 --> 53:00.897
Who are you talking to?

53:04.321 --> 53:06.065
No one.

53:07.959 --> 53:11.783
I'm sorry, but could you
show me the way out of here?

53:12.563 --> 53:16.687
Yeah, I'm kind of lost and...
I actually don't know where we are.

53:16.767 --> 53:19.216
What if we make her show us the way?

53:21.606 --> 53:24.011
- What?
- The creature...

53:24.691 --> 53:26.732
...she knows where the cave is.

53:27.212 --> 53:31.670
And we just make her think that we've
found it and then we try to rescue Olivia.

53:31.750 --> 53:33.838
- Sam...
- No, really.

53:33.918 --> 53:36.799
I mean, she'd have to
at least go and check, right?

53:39.123 --> 53:40.970
Then we just follow her there.

53:42.561 --> 53:44.150
Easy.

53:46.197 --> 53:49.435
- Yeah, I don't know.
- Just help me with this.

53:52.416 --> 53:54.030
Please?

53:55.106 --> 53:56.653
No.

53:58.208 --> 54:00.222
Come on, let's just go.

54:19.797 --> 54:22.375
Logan? Hey, no...

54:22.455 --> 54:24.256
...just a second.

54:29.940 --> 54:32.685
Yeah, yeah.

54:32.765 --> 54:34.566
Tomorrow after school.

54:35.521 --> 54:37.802
No, she doesn't suspect anything.

54:38.815 --> 54:40.359
Yeah.

54:41.062 --> 54:43.680
I got the location of the cave from Alison.

54:45.123 --> 54:46.820
Mm-hmm.

54:47.201 --> 54:48.738
Tomorrow.

54:50.161 --> 54:52.576
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

55:18.489 --> 55:20.778
Liz, have you seen my phone?

55:20.858 --> 55:23.580
I can't keep track of all your things, Sam.

55:23.660 --> 55:25.908
Hurry up, you're gonna be late.

55:41.873 --> 55:43.690
Just watch it!

55:46.216 --> 55:49.601
- You're really hung up on her, aren't you?
- I tried to kiss her.

55:50.121 --> 55:51.935
She doesn't let anyone in.

55:53.591 --> 55:56.225
You know, she just makes me feel so crazy!

56:01.965 --> 56:03.740
She used to have a sister...

56:04.338 --> 56:05.691
...Grace.

56:06.169 --> 56:09.192
Her mom was this total burnout reject...

56:09.272 --> 56:11.696
...always going to parties and stuff.

56:11.776 --> 56:13.791
And then one day, she just never came home.

56:14.111 --> 56:16.167
And Sam was alone with Grace.

56:17.047 --> 56:19.002
What happened?

56:19.082 --> 56:22.306
Eventually the upstairs neighbors
noticed the mail piling up.

56:22.927 --> 56:26.668
When they found her,
Sam was in really rough shape.

56:27.158 --> 56:29.405
And Grace was...

56:57.220 --> 57:00.678
- Logan, I...
- It's not that.

57:00.758 --> 57:02.418
I just want to help with Olivia.

57:04.563 --> 57:08.385
So, I went back home
and grabbed a bunch of stuff.

57:09.665 --> 57:13.925
I wasn't sure what we'd need
so I just grabbed a bit of everything.

57:14.005 --> 57:15.496
A rope...

57:15.576 --> 57:18.663
...there's some granola, a knife...

57:18.743 --> 57:20.997
...my dad's earthquake preparedness kit.

57:21.077 --> 57:24.165
It's got flares, a radio...

57:24.245 --> 57:28.297
...first aid, bandages and a poncho.

57:31.455 --> 57:33.303
You are...

57:38.462 --> 57:39.993
Thanks.

57:42.866 --> 57:44.480
Thank you.

58:10.595 --> 58:12.164
Samantha?

58:12.701 --> 58:14.195
Can I have a word, please?

58:29.346 --> 58:33.105
- What's this about?
- We just want to ask you a few questions.

58:34.185 --> 58:36.761
She's not under arrest, is she?

58:37.221 --> 58:39.730
No, no.

58:41.090 --> 58:44.730
It's just... I'm supposed to be meeting
someone. It's really important.

58:45.695 --> 58:48.587
Well, call 'em, tell 'em
you're gonna be late.

58:49.467 --> 58:53.073
You have a cell phone, don't you?
All the kids have cell phones these days.

58:54.622 --> 58:56.507
What, did you leave it at home?

58:57.607 --> 58:59.430
I lost it.

58:59.510 --> 59:01.057
Oh.

59:11.988 --> 59:14.011
This it?

59:14.591 --> 59:16.672
Where were you last night?

59:26.436 --> 59:28.517
You recognize this place?

59:34.144 --> 59:35.498
Did Alison...

59:37.179 --> 59:38.972
...her house burned down?

59:39.982 --> 59:42.878
- Did she...
- No, we haven't found a body...

59:43.638 --> 59:45.777
...doesn't mean there isn't one.

59:45.857 --> 59:47.945
We found your phone at the scene.

59:48.025 --> 59:50.281
I'm just curious how it got there.

59:50.961 --> 59:53.717
I was at home all night with my family.

59:53.797 --> 59:55.878
I'm going to go call her parents.

59:58.702 --> 01:00:02.184
That's a good idea, get them over here.

01:00:11.649 --> 01:00:15.313
- You want to tell me what this is about?
- Please, I just really need to call my friend.

01:00:15.393 --> 01:00:18.542
<i>Okay? He's... he's waiting for me.</i>

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.062
I'm not scared.

01:01:24.822 --> 01:01:26.637
He's not answering.

01:01:30.828 --> 01:01:32.641
Her parents are here.

01:01:40.971 --> 01:01:42.860
Can I have a glass of water?

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.086
Sure.

01:02:02.993 --> 01:02:06.017
Have you noticed something
different in her behavior lately?

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:07.747
No...

01:02:07.827 --> 01:02:10.218
...I mean, not really. We've...

01:02:10.298 --> 01:02:12.890
...we've been through a rough patch lately...

01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:16.793
...with Olivia missing, as you know,
and... it's been hard on everyone.

01:02:16.873 --> 01:02:18.922
Liz, please, you don't...

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:21.623
...you don't have to defend her
against every singl... yes, we have...

01:02:21.703 --> 01:02:23.791
- ...we've had problems with her recently.
- Hey!

01:02:25.715 --> 01:02:28.538
- Sam!
- No! Stop!

01:02:29.618 --> 01:02:32.613
Let me go! Let me go!
Logan's out there! He needs me!

01:02:32.693 --> 01:02:34.473
- Who?
- Please, she's going to kill him!

01:02:34.553 --> 01:02:37.931
- What? Who are you talking about?
- Olivia! She's a monster!

01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.205
Oh, God.

01:03:00.851 --> 01:03:02.321
Oh, God.

01:03:11.595 --> 01:03:14.142
Oh, God, no. Please, no.

01:03:32.649 --> 01:03:35.264
Oh, God, no. Please, no.

01:03:37.922 --> 01:03:40.804
Oh, God. Please, no. No!

01:03:47.897 --> 01:03:49.723
What the hell, Sam?

01:03:50.603 --> 01:03:53.156
What... what are we supposed to think?

01:03:53.236 --> 01:03:55.814
You're sneaking out of the house,
going God knows where...

01:03:55.894 --> 01:03:59.096
...getting up to God knows what.
Saying crazy things about Olivia.

01:03:59.176 --> 01:04:01.666
We want to understand, Sam. We're worried.

01:04:01.746 --> 01:04:04.928
Yes, we're worried about our family.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:07.971
We don't know if we can
trust you around her right now.

01:04:08.051 --> 01:04:10.102
But that's not Olivia.

01:04:12.259 --> 01:04:14.063
It's not.

01:04:14.491 --> 01:04:18.774
And I really don't know how to make you
see it. I just really don't, but it's not her.

01:04:20.431 --> 01:04:23.404
She killed Alison
and she put my phone there...

01:04:23.484 --> 01:04:25.848
...and she's really dangerous, okay?

01:04:27.136 --> 01:04:29.117
I mean, Logan's...

01:04:35.512 --> 01:04:37.011
What happened to him?

01:04:39.421 --> 01:04:41.512
What did you do?

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.970
- Olivia! What did you do?
- Olivia!

01:04:47.958 --> 01:04:51.206
- What's wrong with Sam, Mom?
- Come here.

01:04:54.465 --> 01:04:57.545
Sometimes people... people get broken.

01:04:57.625 --> 01:05:00.362
The world takes something from them...

01:05:01.207 --> 01:05:03.431
...and they can't get it back.

01:05:03.511 --> 01:05:06.096
What's going to happen to her?

01:05:07.276 --> 01:05:09.357
I don't know.

01:05:11.882 --> 01:05:13.928
Poor little thing.

01:05:22.226 --> 01:05:23.811
Okay.

01:05:24.548 --> 01:05:26.592
Here's what's going to happen.

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:29.353
You're going to go to your room...

01:05:29.733 --> 01:05:32.974
...and you're going to wait there
until the social worker arrives.

01:05:35.372 --> 01:05:37.862
I knew this was a mistake, I knew it.

01:05:38.442 --> 01:05:40.302
I knew it right from the start.

01:05:41.878 --> 01:05:43.459
Yeah.

01:05:52.055 --> 01:05:53.936
So did I.

01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:37.639
Remember when we first met?

01:06:38.835 --> 01:06:41.268
I put my hand on your shoulder and...

01:06:42.725 --> 01:06:44.829
...you flinched.

01:06:44.909 --> 01:06:48.498
And I thought, "what has the world
done to this poor kid?"

01:06:49.051 --> 01:06:50.926
Nobody deserves that.

01:06:54.051 --> 01:06:57.086
I know how cruel that world can be.

01:06:58.005 --> 01:07:00.335
And I really wanted to change that for you.

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:08.352
I know you're a good kid, Sam,
and I want believe that you don't mean this.

01:07:09.232 --> 01:07:11.113
That it's not your fault.

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:15.550
But I don't think I can help you.

01:07:21.044 --> 01:07:23.058
I don't know what else to do.

01:07:30.253 --> 01:07:32.167
I'm sorry.

01:08:38.587 --> 01:08:40.344
You don't belong here.

01:08:40.424 --> 01:08:43.446
And you'll do what? Make me go back?

01:08:43.826 --> 01:08:47.149
You understand nothing
with your brief, scrambling little lives.

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:49.310
How could you?

01:08:50.066 --> 01:08:53.115
You don't belong here, none of you do.

01:08:58.241 --> 01:09:00.122
Why are you doing this?

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:03.767
All of this used to be green...

01:09:05.048 --> 01:09:06.870
...filled with our song.

01:09:07.649 --> 01:09:10.072
Then you came.

01:09:10.152 --> 01:09:13.723
You noisesome, songless things.

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:16.287
Look at you...

01:09:16.908 --> 01:09:19.648
...such a poor, broken thing.

01:09:19.728 --> 01:09:21.943
You're only made for sorrow.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:26.560
This life suits me just fine.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.738
Your Olivia can stay buried.

01:09:51.595 --> 01:09:53.751
- Get off of her!
- Stop it!

01:09:53.831 --> 01:09:56.626
- Get her out of here. Call the cops!
- Let me go!

01:09:56.706 --> 01:09:58.288
Stop!

01:10:02.673 --> 01:10:06.400
Sam! Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam! Think about this!
Think about this, please!

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.473
Please, Sam, think about it!

01:10:31.168 --> 01:10:32.682
Emily!

01:10:39.142 --> 01:10:42.433
Sam, what's going on? Whoa, hey.

01:10:42.813 --> 01:10:44.237
Hey, it's okay.

01:10:50.988 --> 01:10:52.501
Sam?

01:10:56.926 --> 01:10:59.007
What do you want to do now?

01:11:01.364 --> 01:11:04.179
That thing.

01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:08.926
It was right. I'm...

01:11:11.583 --> 01:11:13.439
I'm broken.

01:11:16.512 --> 01:11:18.326
I ruined everything.

01:11:23.887 --> 01:11:25.768
I wasn't there.

01:11:30.527 --> 01:11:33.541
Olivia needed me and I wasn't there.

01:11:36.466 --> 01:11:38.948
Hey, I've got some money saved up.

01:11:40.804 --> 01:11:42.825
Why don't we just go.

01:11:42.905 --> 01:11:45.752
Let's just get out of here
like we always talked about.

01:11:49.478 --> 01:11:51.920
We'll go somewhere sunny, right?

01:11:52.365 --> 01:11:54.201
On a beach, okay?

01:11:55.352 --> 01:11:57.160
And we can open a skate shop...

01:11:58.768 --> 01:12:00.571
...on the boardwalk.

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:04.907
Just you and me, okay?

01:12:11.434 --> 01:12:13.714
I'm gonna get some stuff.

01:12:38.462 --> 01:12:40.042
Emily?

01:13:00.684 --> 01:13:02.231
Em?

01:14:09.418 --> 01:14:11.714
Alison? But the fire...

01:14:12.154 --> 01:14:16.012
I've been shadowing you ever since it
happened. You were right about your sister.

01:14:16.092 --> 01:14:20.683
If you can find her, free her,
it'll have nowhere to hide, no disguise.

01:14:20.763 --> 01:14:23.576
- You can kill it just by looking.
- Five, four...

01:14:23.656 --> 01:14:28.133
- Go, save your sister.
- ...three, two...

01:14:28.213 --> 01:14:29.496
...one.

01:14:29.576 --> 01:14:32.377
- I thought I might see her again.
- Ready or not, here I come.

01:14:32.476 --> 01:14:34.440
Tell Janie I'm sorry.

01:14:34.777 --> 01:14:38.702
I should've done more.
I should have done more. Go!

01:14:38.782 --> 01:14:40.375
Go!

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.746
No!

01:14:45.826 --> 01:14:48.227
No! No!

01:15:02.973 --> 01:15:05.854
No! No!

01:16:12.009 --> 01:16:13.821
I'm sorry.

01:16:17.546 --> 01:16:19.360
I'm sorry, Janie.

01:16:21.551 --> 01:16:23.098
Alison...

01:16:36.648 --> 01:16:38.280
I wasn't smart enough.

01:16:40.853 --> 01:16:42.951
I couldn't see the way.

01:19:55.465 --> 01:19:57.100
Olivia?

01:19:58.247 --> 01:19:59.375
Hey.

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:02.226
Did you get some rest?

01:20:56.458 --> 01:20:58.282
Olivia!

01:20:59.096 --> 01:21:00.661
Olivia, Olivia.

01:21:02.965 --> 01:21:05.182
None of this feels real, does it?

01:21:06.137 --> 01:21:09.205
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:21:11.206 --> 01:21:13.255
It's like something from a dream.

01:21:36.699 --> 01:21:38.188
What happened?

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:40.749
I've got you. I've got you, okay?

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:44.233
Sam, what... what happened?

01:21:44.313 --> 01:21:46.922
There was singing, it was so pretty.

01:21:48.045 --> 01:21:50.701
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:53.837
Okay, we're gonna go. You're safe now, okay?

01:21:53.917 --> 01:21:56.036
- You're safe, you're safe.
- Okay.

01:21:56.116 --> 01:21:58.328
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:21:58.408 --> 01:22:00.632
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.044
God.

01:22:06.671 --> 01:22:09.293
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:22:19.808 --> 01:22:23.069
It's okay, Olivia, it's okay.

01:22:24.043 --> 01:22:25.854
It can't disguise itself now.

01:22:29.452 --> 01:22:30.622
Okay.

01:22:31.183 --> 01:22:32.713
Okay?

01:22:33.255 --> 01:22:35.414
- Sam! Sam!
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:22:37.594 --> 01:22:39.332
Olivia! Run!

01:22:52.631 --> 01:22:54.201
Sam!

01:22:56.645 --> 01:22:58.569
Sam!

01:22:58.649 --> 01:23:00.280
Sam!

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:09.817
This world is no place...

01:23:09.897 --> 01:23:12.318
...for broken things.

01:23:35.752 --> 01:23:37.008
Sam?

01:23:38.987 --> 01:23:40.535
Sam?

01:23:55.137 --> 01:23:56.717
Sam!

01:23:59.776 --> 01:24:01.237
Sam!

01:24:02.252 --> 01:24:03.848
Sam!

01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:09.770
- Sam?
- I'm here.

01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:12.300
I'm here, Olivia, I'm here.

01:24:20.462 --> 01:24:21.977
Sam?

01:24:33.209 --> 01:24:36.042
Mom! Dad! Over here!

01:24:42.917 --> 01:24:44.362
Olivia?

01:24:49.606 --> 01:24:51.172
Sam.

01:24:53.829 --> 01:24:56.435
- Dad.
- Oh, sweetie, come here.

01:25:11.213 --> 01:25:13.035
Let's go home.

01:25:14.515 --> 01:25:16.396

01:25:55.757 --> 01:25:57.573
You came back for me.

Always.
