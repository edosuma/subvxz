Enough!

00:15.718 --> 00:18.620
Tensions are high, and maybe take five?

00:18.654 --> 00:20.655
Sorry. I was just catching people up.

00:20.689 --> 00:21.856
All right, gang.

00:21.891 --> 00:24.659
I realize now that I've been going about

00:24.693 --> 00:27.295
getting us out of here the wrong way.

00:27.329 --> 00:30.131
I was thinking of big, strong hero moves,

00:30.166 --> 00:31.599
but, um...

00:31.634 --> 00:33.134
Well, I think that was just ego stuff.

00:34.336 --> 00:36.037
So I've come up with a plan

00:36.105 --> 00:38.806
that involves gaining
King Richard's confidence

00:38.841 --> 00:39.974
using my wits.

00:40.009 --> 00:42.644
We believe in you, Galavant. We trust you.

00:42.678 --> 00:44.345
- Right, everyone?
- Mm...

00:44.380 --> 00:46.381
No, he's got this.

00:46.415 --> 00:48.883
Galavant's the complete package,

00:48.917 --> 00:52.920
and I for one am finally just
throwing my arms in the air

00:52.955 --> 00:54.222
and giving in to it.

00:56.959 --> 00:58.426
Are they gonna kiss?

00:58.460 --> 00:59.427
Yeah, they are.

01:01.230 --> 01:02.864
Thank you so much.

01:06.668 --> 01:07.602
Hi.

01:07.636 --> 01:08.970
So, if you keep ignoring

01:09.004 --> 01:11.939
the Russian bathhouse-like steam
surrounding you and Isabella,

01:11.974 --> 01:14.575
you could find yourself in
the permanent friend zone.

01:14.610 --> 01:17.545
So are you gonna, as they say...

01:17.579 --> 01:20.248
"Kiss de girl," huh?

01:22.317 --> 01:24.752
I don't know what's wrong with me, Sid.

01:24.786 --> 01:27.021
This thing with her is just so big.

01:27.055 --> 01:31.726
I feel like a kiss with Isabella
could just go on forever.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.261
What has happened to you?

01:36.231 --> 01:39.066
2:00. Time for lunch.

01:39.101 --> 01:41.469
Enjoy yourselves.

01:41.503 --> 01:43.904
You can have the fat one.

01:43.939 --> 01:46.474
Wait a minute.

01:46.508 --> 01:48.376
Gareth...

01:48.410 --> 01:49.377
What?

01:49.411 --> 01:50.478
I demand an audience with the king.

01:50.512 --> 01:51.645
Oh, do you?

01:51.680 --> 01:53.147
And what makes you think
he'll grant you that?

01:53.181 --> 01:56.951
'Cause I've got some very
mean gossip about Madalena.

01:56.985 --> 01:59.620
And you think the king's
gonna drop everything

01:59.654 --> 02:02.256
just to hear some
scuttlebutt about some girl?

02:03.658 --> 02:06.327
She's got feet like a 90-year-old troll.

02:06.361 --> 02:07.728
It's delicious!

02:07.763 --> 02:08.829
No, it's disgusting.

02:08.864 --> 02:10.898
She's got bunions, gnarled knuckles, warts.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.299
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

02:12.334 --> 02:14.902
That's why she wears her socks in bed.

02:16.104 --> 02:18.105
I haven't laughed so hard in minutes.

02:18.139 --> 02:21.208
Anyway, the point is, we've both
been scorned by the same woman.

02:21.243 --> 02:22.977
I just thought you'd like to know that.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.514
Good night...

02:27.549 --> 02:29.016
Unless you want to get a drink.

02:29.050 --> 02:31.585
That's an interesting proposition.

02:31.620 --> 02:33.220
Little guy time between frenemies

02:33.254 --> 02:35.589
burnt by the same flame,
bros before hos, all that.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.324
No, I don't think so.

02:37.359 --> 02:38.659
The king needs to get his sleep.

02:38.693 --> 02:40.627
Gareth, why do you always
have to poop on the party?

02:40.662 --> 02:42.696
Maybe because you've got
to fight me to the death

02:42.731 --> 02:43.731
in the morning,

02:43.765 --> 02:45.365
or maybe that your brother has decided

02:45.400 --> 02:48.001
that I'm gonna be his champion,
and for the first time ever,

02:48.036 --> 02:50.170
you've decided to fight
one of your own battles,

02:50.205 --> 02:51.805
and your whole kingdom's at stake.

02:51.840 --> 02:52.940
Does that ring any bells?

02:54.242 --> 02:56.076
Aw, you worried about me, Gar-bear?

02:56.110 --> 02:57.377
Don't call me that.

02:57.412 --> 02:58.645
Well, I'm so sorry if I upset you

02:58.680 --> 03:00.180
the night before you'll probably kill me!

03:00.215 --> 03:03.016
This sucks.

03:03.051 --> 03:05.919
Gareth, do you remember the lullaby

03:05.954 --> 03:07.921
Pearl used to sing to us when we were boys?

03:07.956 --> 03:09.089
Pearl was our nanny.

03:09.123 --> 03:10.857
Old woman, sweet face, big, gigantic boobs.

03:10.892 --> 03:12.426
Come on, man, you must remember.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.403
Well, fine!

03:23.438 --> 03:25.172
I didn't want to sing the
stupid song with you anyway!

03:27.575 --> 03:28.875
Let's have that drink.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.879
Shall we?

03:38.892 --> 03:40.092
You must have felt badly.

03:40.127 --> 03:41.761
Madalena absolutely destroyed me.

03:41.828 --> 03:42.762
Drink up, drink up.

03:42.796 --> 03:44.296
I couldn't get out of bed.

03:44.331 --> 03:46.365
I didn't play my lute for weeks.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.267
What, you think you've got it bad?

03:48.301 --> 03:49.935
Madalena and I never even...

03:49.970 --> 03:51.036
Well, let's just say

03:51.071 --> 03:53.172
she never let me walk through her garden.

03:53.206 --> 03:54.907
I don't follow.

03:54.941 --> 03:57.576
I never pollinated her flower.

03:57.611 --> 03:58.978
What?

04:00.480 --> 04:02.214
Are we talking about the same Madalena?

04:02.249 --> 04:03.616
Yes!

04:03.650 --> 04:05.317
But you were married.

04:05.352 --> 04:07.119
You didn't insist?

04:08.321 --> 04:09.288
I'm not an animal.

04:09.322 --> 04:11.123
I mean, sure, I'll kidnap a woman

04:11.157 --> 04:12.491
and force her to marry me,

04:12.526 --> 04:14.894
but after that, I'm all
about a woman's rights.

04:14.928 --> 04:16.661
I'm a modern, 13th-century man.

04:16.696 --> 04:18.297
Good for you. Cheers to that.

04:18.331 --> 04:19.398
Thank you very much.

04:19.432 --> 04:20.766
You know, the truth be told,

04:20.800 --> 04:22.635
I've always sort of felt that that business

04:22.669 --> 04:24.236
should never happen until two people

04:24.270 --> 04:25.771
really love each other, you know?

04:25.805 --> 04:28.474
Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:28.508 --> 04:31.844
I never loved anyone
until I loved Madalena,

04:31.878 --> 04:35.714
and so that's why I'm...

04:35.749 --> 04:40.486
I've never actually
walked in anyone's garden.

04:43.056 --> 04:43.989
But you're the king.

04:44.023 --> 04:45.057
That's right.

04:45.091 --> 04:47.159
I am the king, so watch your mouth, boy.

04:48.628 --> 04:50.129
I'm sorry I barked at you.

04:50.163 --> 04:51.830
See? This is why I don't have guy friends.

04:51.865 --> 04:53.398
Hey, it's all right, it's all right.

04:53.433 --> 04:55.400
- You're under a lot of pressure.
- I know.

04:55.435 --> 04:56.768
Brother's trying to steal your kingdom.

04:56.803 --> 04:57.903
He's trying to steal your lady,

04:57.937 --> 04:59.638
put you against your best friend.

04:59.672 --> 05:01.106
Times are tough. Drink up.

05:01.140 --> 05:03.408
- Here, let's... let's play a game.
- Hmm?

05:03.443 --> 05:06.211
Let's just say there's this standing king.

05:06.246 --> 05:07.913
And his evil, treacherous brother

05:07.947 --> 05:09.181
comes into town,

05:09.215 --> 05:10.816
and we wanted to sort of
"take care" of him.

05:10.850 --> 05:12.584
I don't know, like, say, tonight.

05:12.619 --> 05:13.952
Do you think anyone would care?

05:15.021 --> 05:16.255
I don't follow.

05:16.289 --> 05:17.456
Kill your brother.

05:18.992 --> 05:19.958
What?!

05:19.993 --> 05:21.793
Have you gone absolutely mad?

05:21.828 --> 05:22.961
What do you expect me to do,

05:22.996 --> 05:24.997
just sneak into Kingsley's bedchamber

05:25.031 --> 05:27.032
and slice his throat while he sleeps?

05:27.066 --> 05:28.133
What, in this outfit?!

05:28.167 --> 05:29.134
Yes.

05:33.373 --> 05:36.508
Everyone, I'm going to kill my brother!

05:36.542 --> 05:38.076
Drinks are on me!

05:39.445 --> 05:41.646

I should have just kissed you.

07:50.642 --> 07:52.410
I should have kissed you ages ago.

Yeah, well, um, maybe we
should talk about this tomorrow.

those forever sort of kisses.

there, I said it, didn't I?

I really needed to get out.

- Oh, no.
- Oh!

08:48.100 --> 08:53.904
My dear, little, dinky brother,
untouched by war and women.

08:55.173 --> 08:57.174
I mean, what I meant was virgin slayer.

08:59.745 --> 09:00.878
You're [Bleep].

09:05.841 --> 09:07.642
Throw lover boy in a dungeon.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.644
So mean.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.946
Oh, and you won't be needing this.

09:12.014 --> 09:13.348
My crown!

09:13.382 --> 09:15.317
He stole my crown.

09:15.351 --> 09:18.319
Keep your chin up. Don't
let them see you cry.

09:18.354 --> 09:20.055
Never let them see you cry.

09:20.089 --> 09:23.258
Gareth, I assume you like women.

09:23.292 --> 09:26.828
If you fight for me, I
will give you land, a title,

09:26.862 --> 09:29.264
and as many women as you desire.

09:29.298 --> 09:31.032
What's your type?

09:31.066 --> 09:33.101
Either really fat or really skinny,

09:33.135 --> 09:34.269
nothing in between.

09:34.303 --> 09:35.637
I'll give you fat and skinny.

09:36.639 --> 09:38.439
I'll get back to you.

09:44.580 --> 09:46.080
Awesome.

09:47.783 --> 09:49.183
It was so rude!

09:49.218 --> 09:51.285
Who does that to my favorite crown?

09:51.320 --> 09:53.354
Did you know that? I
got it for my birthday!

09:54.356 --> 09:56.424
- Galavant...
- Izzy, you're so pretty.

10:00.696 --> 10:03.698
Oh, well, at least he stopped talking.

10:03.732 --> 10:04.799
Yeah, it's great. Yeah. About time.

10:04.833 --> 10:07.068
I failed in my mission, Gareth,

10:07.102 --> 10:08.136
and now it's our last night

10:08.170 --> 10:09.670
before we have to duel to the death.

10:12.074 --> 10:14.742
Come on, let's sing Pearl's song together,

10:14.776 --> 10:16.110
for old times' sake.

10:16.144 --> 10:18.112
Shut up.

10:18.146 --> 10:20.281
I've told you your whole
life to grow a pair,

10:20.315 --> 10:23.017
and you just won't listen, and
now you're gonna die for it.

10:23.051 --> 10:25.219
Even though I'm the one
who's gonna kill you,

10:25.254 --> 10:26.454
it's not my fault!

10:26.488 --> 10:28.656
It's not my fault!

10:28.690 --> 10:30.124
I warned you!

Hi.

12:43.891 --> 12:45.158
How are you?

12:45.192 --> 12:47.560
Oh, God. Ow.

12:47.595 --> 12:49.863
Rough night?

12:49.897 --> 12:51.765
I don't remember what happened.

12:51.799 --> 12:53.299
You said her pretty brain exploded

12:53.334 --> 12:54.601
and went all over her face.

12:54.635 --> 12:55.802
And you tried to kiss her.

12:55.836 --> 12:57.203
You were a bit of a mess, sir.

12:57.238 --> 12:58.405
A big, hot mess.

12:59.540 --> 13:00.674
Well, that's the least of our problems.

13:00.708 --> 13:02.509
I think I might have
ruined our only chance,

13:02.543 --> 13:03.977
and now I don't know what to do.

13:04.011 --> 13:07.046
Good thing I do. Wake up, sire.

13:07.081 --> 13:08.114
We've come to get you out of here.

13:09.283 --> 13:10.784
Oh, God.

13:10.818 --> 13:14.554
Well, I knew you cared.

13:14.588 --> 13:15.688
Take him outside.

13:15.723 --> 13:17.056
This place is horrible.

13:17.091 --> 13:18.925
All right, everyone, take
only the bare essentials.

13:18.959 --> 13:20.693
We can always pick up
odds and ends on the road.

13:20.728 --> 13:22.729
None of you are coming, except you.

13:22.763 --> 13:24.397
What? You're coming with me.

13:24.431 --> 13:27.200
I'm not going anywhere, not
without everyone in here.

13:27.234 --> 13:29.002
You don't have a choice, son.

13:35.709 --> 13:39.045
Listen, I remember what I said last night,

13:39.079 --> 13:40.913
and I meant every word.

13:40.948 --> 13:42.915
I think you're the most wonderful...

13:48.889 --> 13:51.290
I think I'm falling in love.

13:52.893 --> 13:55.628
Nice kiss. I hope he remembers it.

13:55.662 --> 13:57.030
Come on, you.

13:57.064 --> 13:58.832
Galavant, no!

13:59.266 --> 14:00.767
Please, Gareth!

14:00.801 --> 14:02.635
Princess, as long as Galavant's alive,

14:02.669 --> 14:04.404
we stand a chance of being rescued.

14:13.138 --> 14:14.772
What's this?

14:14.807 --> 14:15.841
Where am I?

14:15.875 --> 14:17.476
These pirates will take you and the king

14:17.510 --> 14:19.111
back to his kingdom, where he'll be safe.

14:19.145 --> 14:20.145
What? No.

14:20.179 --> 14:21.613
I'm not leaving her.

14:21.647 --> 14:22.881
I'm going back.

14:22.915 --> 14:24.783
I've left word with my men.

14:24.817 --> 14:26.952
You step one foot in that castle

14:26.986 --> 14:29.254
and everyone you love gets the ax.

14:29.288 --> 14:30.822
No more games, Galavant.

14:30.857 --> 14:33.391
Listen, Gareth, I'm moved,
but I've made my bed,

14:33.426 --> 14:35.327
and for once, I should lie in it.

14:35.361 --> 14:37.429
- You get in that boat.
- No, Gareth.

14:37.463 --> 14:38.897
I know you're doing
this because you love me.

14:38.931 --> 14:40.732
I don't love you. I don't even like you.

14:40.766 --> 14:43.168
No one here likes you, so go.

14:43.202 --> 14:45.070
Well, now you're just
being mean to me so I'll go.

14:45.104 --> 14:46.571
You're self-centered,
self-absorbed,

14:46.606 --> 14:47.839
and you wear too much velvet.

14:47.873 --> 14:49.274
Now you're just going into
a lot of specific details,

14:49.308 --> 14:50.475
so I'll believe you.

14:50.509 --> 14:52.077
You have a skinny left
calf and a crooked...

14:52.111 --> 14:54.646
Okay, okay, fine. I'll go.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.482
But you're not fooling anyone.

14:59.218 --> 15:00.418
Go on. And you.

15:00.453 --> 15:03.021
Not one hair.

15:05.057 --> 15:06.157
I give you my word.

15:06.192 --> 15:08.293
And know this... I will return for them.

15:08.327 --> 15:09.427
Justice will be done.

15:09.462 --> 15:10.762
I'm excited for you,

15:10.796 --> 15:13.598
but let me give you a
couple of instructions.

15:14.700 --> 15:15.800
He can't sleep at night

15:15.835 --> 15:17.669
if he ain't got a second pillow to hug.

15:17.703 --> 15:19.404
Dairy makes him gassy.

15:19.438 --> 15:22.173
And if he gets cross,
give him some salty snacks.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.875
It's good for his electrolytes.

15:23.909 --> 15:26.744
But if one hair on his head gets harmed,

15:26.779 --> 15:29.414
I will hunt you down, I will gut you,

15:29.481 --> 15:31.950
and I will use your skin as a lap blanket.

15:31.984 --> 15:33.117
Do you understand?

15:35.487 --> 15:36.454
We have a deal.

15:44.196 --> 15:45.897
All right, shove off, me hearties.

15:45.931 --> 15:47.999
Arrr!

16:00.512 --> 16:12.757
♪ Good night, my friend ♪

16:14.393 --> 16:16.360
What in God's name is going on here?!

16:17.896 --> 16:18.863
Galavant and King Richard have gone.

16:18.897 --> 16:20.231
We don't know where they are.

16:20.265 --> 16:23.267
Find them or I'll eat your
firstborn for breakfast.

16:25.203 --> 16:27.438
He's behind this. I know it.

16:27.472 --> 16:28.506
Where have you been?

16:28.540 --> 16:30.174
I'm sorry, milady, I must have slept in.

16:30.208 --> 16:31.342
Oh, really?

16:31.376 --> 16:33.077
Well, why don't you help yourself wake up

16:33.145 --> 16:36.180
by going down to the dungeon
and killing everyone who's left?

16:36.248 --> 16:39.650
Okay. It will be my pleasure.

16:51.229 --> 16:54.031
Okay, here's the plan.

16:54.065 --> 16:56.867
One of you is gonna knock
me out and take my keys.

16:56.902 --> 16:58.803
What? You're not going to kill us?

16:58.837 --> 17:00.037
I keep my promises,

17:00.071 --> 17:02.373
and I promised your little lover boy

17:02.407 --> 17:03.474
that I'd take care of you.

17:03.508 --> 17:05.209
So who's first?

17:05.242 --> 17:06.743
Come on.

17:12.117 --> 17:14.151
Next.

17:15.185 --> 17:16.319
Die!

17:16.354 --> 17:17.288
Next.

17:30.168 --> 17:34.338
Just take the keys and go.

17:34.372 --> 17:36.173
Not you. You're coming with me.

17:36.207 --> 17:37.307
Why?

17:37.342 --> 17:40.244
I think I'll keep you for insurance.

17:40.278 --> 17:42.679
Just go! I'll be fine.
Just get everyone to safety.

17:42.714 --> 17:43.747
I'll come back for you.

17:43.781 --> 17:46.550
Please do! So scared!

17:52.657 --> 17:56.260
Gareth, did you kill everyone
who needed to be killed?

17:56.294 --> 17:57.861
No, milady.

17:57.895 --> 18:00.864
What kind of kingdom are you running here?

18:00.898 --> 18:03.266
A henchman that doesn't kill,

18:03.301 --> 18:06.003
a queen who does nothing about it.

18:06.037 --> 18:09.139
This place has gone soft...

18:14.212 --> 18:18.181
Turns out he wasn't my type.

18:28.593 --> 18:30.460
You just got a promotion.

18:31.896 --> 18:33.697
Sit.

18:45.609 --> 18:48.645
You're gonna have to either
lose or gain a lot of weight.

19:01.759 --> 19:03.927
We had nowhere else to go.

19:03.961 --> 19:06.262
