(reel softly clicking)

00:09.960 --> 00:13.293
(waves softly crashing)

00:24.746 --> 00:26.505
- I've read so many good things

00:26.505 --> 00:29.885
about what you guys are doing, what else?

00:29.885 --> 00:31.716
I've really get along with most people.

00:31.716 --> 00:35.988
I got a lot of friends, do
you even care about that, no.

00:35.988 --> 00:37.389
Thank you.

00:37.389 --> 00:38.580
Hey!

00:38.580 --> 00:41.501
- Oh my God, hey!
- What are you doing here?

00:41.501 --> 00:42.403
- Interview.

00:42.403 --> 00:44.342
- Me too, marketing role?

00:44.342 --> 00:45.723
- Yup.

00:45.723 --> 00:46.721
- Harry.
- Hey.

00:46.721 --> 00:48.230
Anyway, we should grab a coffee, catch up.

00:48.230 --> 00:49.617
- Yeah, cool.

00:49.617 --> 00:50.585
- [Interview] So where'd
you come from today?

00:50.585 --> 00:51.464
- [Harry] Hawthorn.

00:51.464 --> 00:52.511

I've come from Toorak.

00:52.511 --> 00:53.344

00:54.177 --> 00:57.010

01:04.263 --> 01:07.514
(soft acoustic guitar)

01:16.573 --> 01:19.240
- Sorry, the traffic was so bad.

01:24.706 --> 01:25.539
- [Seb] Hey.

01:25.539 --> 01:26.586
- Hey.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.836
- How'd you go?

01:29.250 --> 01:31.961
- (softly sighs) Is that
everything for Table 8?

01:31.961 --> 01:32.794
- Yeah.

01:40.024 --> 01:44.444
Hey, don't stress about the
job, there'll be others.

01:44.444 --> 01:46.169
- I know, I just feel like I keep trying

01:46.169 --> 01:48.123
and it just gets me nowhere.

01:48.123 --> 01:49.414
- Try playing a show to three people.

01:49.414 --> 01:52.896
- Okay, seriously, just
put up some selfies

01:52.896 --> 01:54.616
on your band page and at your next gig,

01:54.616 --> 01:56.988
there'll be like a line of teenage girls.

01:56.988 --> 01:58.270
- Ooh, sign me up

01:58.270 --> 02:00.130
- You should listen to me, you know.

02:00.130 --> 02:02.236
I have a degree in digital marketing.

02:02.236 --> 02:03.115

02:03.115 --> 02:04.322
- Yeah.

02:04.322 --> 02:06.999

02:16.109 --> 02:16.942

02:54.075 --> 02:55.992

Couple more drinks.

really late and I've gotta

03:13.391 --> 03:14.391

- You're home.

04:27.986 --> 04:29.231
Thanks for walking me.

- No worries.

04:30.740 --> 04:32.136
- But you know, just
because you did doesn't mean

04:32.136 --> 04:34.409
I'm gonna let you in.

04:34.409 --> 04:35.656
- Obviously.

04:35.656 --> 04:36.728
- Obviously.
- All right.

04:36.728 --> 04:38.024
- That's definitely not happening.

04:38.024 --> 04:39.352
- Yeah, thanks for the entertaining walk,

04:39.352 --> 04:40.492
and insulting my band.

04:40.492 --> 04:41.325
- [Nina] Yeah.

04:41.325 --> 04:42.408
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:50.273 --> 04:51.831
I've just got hello.

04:51.831 --> 04:53.807
(laughing)
Is that creepy?

04:53.807 --> 04:56.052
- Yes, it is.
- Okay. (laughs)

04:56.052 --> 04:58.081
- [Stacey] Just do
something really casual.

04:58.081 --> 05:00.567
- Like, maybe I can send him an emoji.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.145
- Just don't send him the eggplant one.

05:02.145 --> 05:04.220
- As if, I'm not like you.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.053
- [Stacey] Ah-ha.

05:05.053 --> 05:08.837
- Come on Tazzie, come
on, come on, come on.

05:08.837 --> 05:10.527
Choo-choo-choo-choo, come on puss.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.718
- What is that noise?

05:12.718 --> 05:14.160
Did you just come up with that?

05:14.160 --> 05:16.118
- No, I had a cat when I was a kid,

05:16.118 --> 05:17.069
that's how you get 'em.
- Did you?

05:17.069 --> 05:17.902
- Yeah.

05:17.902 --> 05:18.735
- Aw, that's nice.
- Come on,

05:18.735 --> 05:20.400
choo-choo-choo-choo,
puss, puss, puss, come on.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.233
- It's not working.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.066
- No, it's not working.

05:22.066 --> 05:26.734
- [Nina] No, she's staying
there for a few more hours

05:26.734 --> 05:27.684
- She's not so friendly.

05:27.684 --> 05:29.146
- She is really friendly.

05:29.146 --> 05:29.979
- Really?

05:29.979 --> 05:30.906
- It's just with certain people.

05:30.906 --> 05:32.486
So maybe you're giving off bad vibes.

05:32.486 --> 05:33.836
- Really, bad juju, doesn't like me.

05:33.836 --> 05:35.383
- Mm-hm, bad juju.

05:35.383 --> 05:38.210
(both laughing)

05:38.210 --> 05:40.115
- I should probably go.

05:40.115 --> 05:40.948
- Okay.

05:42.390 --> 05:45.577
Well, thanks for helping me
with the kitty litter and,

05:45.577 --> 05:48.353
you know, the couch thing.

05:48.353 --> 05:49.936
- Anytime, anytime.

05:58.197 --> 06:00.110
- Are you gonna show me how to do it?

06:00.110 --> 06:01.360
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

06:02.647 --> 06:04.147
Then go on.
- Okay.

06:10.299 --> 06:12.322
- I don't think I can do that.

06:12.322 --> 06:13.867
How do you get that much
smoke in your mouth?

06:13.867 --> 06:15.991
- You suck it in.

06:15.991 --> 06:17.241
- Right, ready?

06:19.402 --> 06:22.235
(loudly laughing)

06:24.469 --> 06:26.247
That was really funny.

06:26.247 --> 06:28.031
I feel like I just burnt my lip.

06:28.031 --> 06:28.864
- Did you?

06:28.864 --> 06:30.169
You did well, it was really--
- I did well, thanks.

06:30.169 --> 06:32.500
- Maybe that's enough--
- When am I gonna feel it?

06:32.500 --> 06:33.333
Right away?

06:33.333 --> 06:34.504
- In a second.
- Okay.

06:34.504 --> 06:37.926
(both softly laughing)

06:37.926 --> 06:40.177
Aw, I think I did burn my lip.

06:40.177 --> 06:41.452
- Does it hurt?
- Mm-hm.

06:41.452 --> 06:42.427
- Ooh.
- Is it burned?

06:42.427 --> 06:43.562
- No.

06:43.562 --> 06:45.852
Oh, no, it is, holy shit.

06:45.852 --> 06:46.854
- Is it really?

06:46.854 --> 06:47.918
- Oh you're paranoid?

06:47.918 --> 06:48.865
- Yeah.

06:48.865 --> 06:50.683
(both laughing)

06:50.683 --> 06:53.100
(soft music)

06:58.403 --> 06:59.820
- They're idiots.

07:01.214 --> 07:03.250
You're overqualified for the job.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.358
- Seb, you're just saying
that 'cause I didn't get it.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.989
- I'm not saying that, you're
really good at what you do.

07:07.989 --> 07:08.929
- How do you know?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.599
- 'Cause I've seen what you do.

07:10.599 --> 07:11.954
What do you mean how do I know?

07:11.954 --> 07:14.784
And you're a hard worker.

07:14.784 --> 07:16.046
- Obviously there's
something wrong with me.

07:16.046 --> 07:17.392
- There's nothing wrong
with you, you're just--

07:17.392 --> 07:19.309
- I've been trying for months, man.

07:19.309 --> 07:22.692
- You'll get there, it
just wasn't the right fit.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.109
(soft music)

07:28.809 --> 07:30.822
This was my mom's favorite spot.

07:30.822 --> 07:31.655
- Really?

07:31.655 --> 07:34.822
- She used to bring me down her heaps.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.488
- [Nina] Seb give me..
Hey, this is my kitchen.

07:40.488 --> 07:41.494
You can't come into my kitchen--

07:41.494 --> 07:42.348
- It's not your kitchen.
- And just take things.

07:42.348 --> 07:43.537
- Don't come in and just take things.

07:43.537 --> 07:46.057
- I think it's Hok's kitchen, TBH.

07:46.057 --> 07:47.549
- Uh-uh-uh.
- Give me the sauce.

07:47.549 --> 07:50.331
(softly giggles) Don't eat my hair.

07:50.331 --> 07:51.726
Oh, my god.

07:51.726 --> 07:52.893
- What?
- Look.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.089
- 1000 likes.

07:56.089 --> 07:58.763
- How much do you love me right now?

07:58.763 --> 08:01.180
(soft music)

08:04.318 --> 08:06.434
It's really good, it's
like salty and sweet.

08:06.434 --> 08:07.267
- Hey, shut your eyes.

08:07.267 --> 08:08.100
- Why?

08:08.100 --> 08:09.825
What are you doing, don't.

08:09.825 --> 08:12.438
- Tell me what this feels like.

08:12.438 --> 08:15.148
- Oh my god, it actually kind of hurts.

08:15.148 --> 08:17.536
It's like a horrible acupuncture.

08:17.536 --> 08:18.983
- Oh, it is kind of weird.

08:18.983 --> 08:20.118
- Yeah, it's really weird.

08:20.118 --> 08:23.773
(phone softly vibrating)
Oh, hang on.

08:23.773 --> 08:25.367
Hello, Nina speaking.

08:25.367 --> 08:26.892
- [Seb] I like it.

08:26.892 --> 08:29.559
- Oh, hi, yeah, good, thank you.

08:32.368 --> 08:33.618
That's amazing.

08:36.818 --> 08:37.736
- Hurry up!

08:38.621 --> 08:40.217
- Well, I'd be relocating from Melbourne,

08:40.217 --> 08:43.885
so could I have some
time to think about it?

08:45.375 --> 08:47.258
Look how cute they are.

08:47.258 --> 08:48.152
(Seb softly groans)

08:48.152 --> 08:49.731
No, you don't like that.

08:49.731 --> 08:51.362
- Mm-mm.
- Why?

08:51.362 --> 08:55.074
Look at that celebration of
love right here on the beach.

08:55.074 --> 08:56.339
Look how happy they are.
- Regret.

08:56.339 --> 08:57.576
(both laughing)

08:57.576 --> 08:58.743
- Oy.
- Regret.

09:01.460 --> 09:02.313
Nah, that's pretty cute.

09:02.313 --> 09:03.980
- It is pretty cute.

09:07.251 --> 09:08.751
(softly laughing)

09:08.751 --> 09:09.584
- What?

09:11.550 --> 09:15.067
- [Nina] I just wanna ask you something.

09:15.067 --> 09:16.524
It's kind of awkward.

09:16.524 --> 09:17.449
Don't. (softly laughs)

09:17.449 --> 09:18.282
- What?

09:21.366 --> 09:22.483
- Let's hear it.

09:22.483 --> 09:25.441
- [Nina] Would you wanna do
that one day, in the future?

09:27.187 --> 09:28.922
- I've been thinking
the same, kind of thing.

09:28.922 --> 09:30.183
(soft piano music)

09:30.183 --> 09:31.505
- Are you asking me now?

09:31.505 --> 09:32.338
- Sort of.

09:32.338 --> 09:34.088
- Oh, double awkward.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.773
- No, I don't wanna see anyone else.

09:37.773 --> 09:40.151
- Yeah, no, neither do I.

09:40.151 --> 09:43.068
(soft piano music)

09:45.560 --> 09:46.477
Stop it..

09:47.422 --> 09:48.255
- No.

09:49.814 --> 09:51.927
- You're in like a weird spot.

09:52.985 --> 09:54.677
(both softly chuckling)

09:58.862 --> 10:01.055
So do you sing as well?

10:01.055 --> 10:02.138
- A bit.
- No.

10:03.197 --> 10:06.595
- No one's asked me to go
on tour, put it that way.

10:06.595 --> 10:07.599
- Huh?

10:07.599 --> 10:09.542
- I had a meeting with a band.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.773
- When?

10:10.773 --> 10:11.773
- Last week.

10:13.088 --> 10:16.704
They contacted me on the fan page.

10:16.704 --> 10:18.134
- You made that, didn't you?

10:18.134 --> 10:19.301
- Mm-hm, yeah.

10:23.744 --> 10:26.944
- It's pretty cool, they
lost their front man

10:26.944 --> 10:29.802
so they need someone. For a little while.

10:30.785 --> 10:32.452
- When is this tour?

10:35.128 --> 10:38.813
Won't I cramp your style,
with your little groupies?

10:38.813 --> 10:40.442
- Groupies?

10:40.442 --> 10:41.275
Where?

10:41.275 --> 10:42.108
- Oy!

10:45.428 --> 10:47.694
You know I got that job I went for.

10:47.694 --> 10:49.277
- In Sydney?
- Yeah.

10:50.621 --> 10:52.495
Turned it down.

10:52.495 --> 10:53.328
- Why?

10:57.487 --> 10:59.159
- Are you being serious?

10:59.159 --> 10:59.992
- Yes.

11:01.622 --> 11:03.017
I mean, the whole time I've known you,

11:03.017 --> 11:05.283
this is all you've gone on about.

11:05.283 --> 11:07.112
- What about you?

11:07.112 --> 11:10.112
You've got this amazing opportunity.

11:11.764 --> 11:14.347
- I'd probably just fuck it up.

11:16.639 --> 11:17.472
What?

11:20.420 --> 11:21.549
- And she really likes a mixture

11:21.549 --> 11:24.807
of half wet food and half dry food.

11:24.807 --> 11:26.271
- Hey, how are you getting
to airport tomorrow?

11:26.271 --> 11:27.854
Do you need a lift?

11:28.745 --> 11:31.611
- No, I'm getting a train.

11:31.611 --> 11:32.944
- Suit yourself.

11:43.745 --> 11:47.328
(cat softly purring)
- Aw.

11:48.603 --> 11:51.939
Are you gonna miss Mama when I go away?

11:51.939 --> 11:53.189
It's all right.

11:55.096 --> 11:57.513
(soft music)

12:21.941 --> 12:24.608
(ominous music)

12:26.849 --> 12:27.682
(ominous music hit)

12:31.707 --> 12:35.124
(beats softly pulsating)

13:06.979 --> 13:09.812
(softly rustling)

13:13.377 --> 13:16.710
(birds softly chirping)

13:20.281 --> 13:23.698
(beats softly pulsating)

13:32.476 --> 13:37.476
(beats softly pulsating)
(soft ominous music)

13:43.176 --> 13:45.160
(car horn loudly honks)

13:45.160 --> 13:47.577
(soft music)

13:53.542 --> 13:55.429
(keypad softly chiming)

13:55.429 --> 13:57.094
(phone softly dialing)

13:57.094 --> 13:59.050
- [Recording] Your service
has been disconnected.

13:59.050 --> 14:02.222
Please contact customer services.

14:02.222 --> 14:05.639
(beats softly pulsating)

14:21.943 --> 14:22.921
(door shuts)

14:22.921 --> 14:26.338
(beats softly pulsating)

14:31.897 --> 14:34.456
(ominous music)

14:34.456 --> 14:35.653
- Whoa!

14:35.653 --> 14:36.951
- [Michael] Thank God!

14:36.951 --> 14:37.833
- What are you doing?

14:37.833 --> 14:38.666
- You're okay?

14:38.666 --> 14:39.499
- What?

14:40.659 --> 14:42.492
- Where have you been?

14:43.433 --> 14:44.893
Why didn't you call?

14:44.893 --> 14:47.464
- What are you talking about, Dad?

14:47.464 --> 14:48.990
- Just once, it wouldn't have been

14:48.990 --> 14:50.494
too much to ask, would it?

14:50.494 --> 14:52.521
- You're tanked, get off me.

14:52.521 --> 14:55.938
(beats softly pulsating)

14:59.687 --> 15:01.136
- [Michael] It's been a year, Seb.

15:01.136 --> 15:03.803
(ominous music)

15:10.053 --> 15:11.806
- What have you done?

15:11.806 --> 15:13.586
- Well, what'd you think would happen?

15:13.586 --> 15:15.856
- Where's my guitar?

15:15.856 --> 15:17.299
- With charity, mate.

15:17.299 --> 15:18.805
You dropped off the face of the planet.

15:18.805 --> 15:20.423
- Stop bullshitting,
I was here last night!

15:20.423 --> 15:21.885
- Don't make things worse.

15:21.885 --> 15:22.718
- I'm not!

15:24.023 --> 15:25.636
- [Michael] Where have you been?

15:25.636 --> 15:26.817
- Nowhere!

15:26.817 --> 15:29.484
(ominous music)

15:34.807 --> 15:36.474
- You in trouble?

15:37.595 --> 15:40.887
- You're telling me I skipped
a year, it's nuts, it's nuts!

15:40.887 --> 15:42.231
- Stop being a little shit!

15:42.231 --> 15:43.785
- I'm not!
- Tell me the truth!

15:43.785 --> 15:45.793
- I am, just listen!

15:45.793 --> 15:48.083
You never listen, get off me!

15:48.083 --> 15:49.518
- I'd listen if ya had something sensible

15:49.518 --> 15:51.452
to say and be honest!

15:51.452 --> 15:53.869
(soft music)

16:05.613 --> 16:09.383
- (softly chattering) Thank you.

16:09.383 --> 16:11.800
(soft music)

16:24.911 --> 16:25.755
Hey, Leah?

16:25.755 --> 16:26.588
- Yes, one second.

16:26.588 --> 16:28.610
- Okay, if a guy turns up looking for me,

16:28.610 --> 16:29.889
I'm not here, okay?

16:29.889 --> 16:30.722
- A client?

16:30.722 --> 16:33.068
- No, just someone you
don't know, someone else.

16:33.068 --> 16:35.485
(soft music)

16:37.264 --> 16:38.590
- [Seb] Can you wait?

16:38.590 --> 16:40.167
Nina!
- What?

16:40.167 --> 16:42.235
- Can I explain?

16:42.235 --> 16:43.811
- No, just go back to
wherever you've been.

16:43.811 --> 16:44.732
- But that's what I'm trying to tell you,

16:44.732 --> 16:46.236
I haven't been anywhere!

16:46.236 --> 16:47.907
I haven't been, I was just one the road!

16:47.907 --> 16:50.129
- Yeah, why am I not surprised?

16:50.129 --> 16:51.013
- [Seb] I've lost a year!

16:51.013 --> 16:53.409
- Well, I haven't, okay?

16:53.409 --> 16:55.333
So if you wanna piss
your life up the wall,

16:55.333 --> 16:56.750
then fine, do it.

16:59.553 --> 17:00.871
Do you want me to call the cops?

17:00.871 --> 17:01.740
'Cause I will if you keep--

17:01.740 --> 17:04.121
- Yes, call the cops, call
the cops, this is nuts!

17:04.121 --> 17:05.854
- I don't even know what
you're talking about anymore.

17:05.854 --> 17:08.974
- This year, I don't remember anything!

17:08.974 --> 17:10.542
- Just lay off the drugs, Seb.

17:10.542 --> 17:12.960
(soft music)

17:20.449 --> 17:22.678
- [Stacey] You sure he
wasn't taking the piss?

17:22.678 --> 17:24.715
- Maybe, but he was like
literally begging me

17:24.715 --> 17:27.270
to believe him, weird.

17:27.270 --> 17:29.343
- Why would he say
something that's so like--

17:29.343 --> 17:31.426
- I don't know, honestly.

17:32.794 --> 17:34.257
- Do you think he still loves you?

17:34.257 --> 17:37.103
- [Nina] What do I care, anyway?

17:37.103 --> 17:38.192
What?

17:38.192 --> 17:39.692
- No, it's just...

17:41.546 --> 17:43.248
- What time are you leaving again?

17:43.248 --> 17:44.498
- [Stacey] Why?

17:45.566 --> 17:47.940
- I'm gonna come with.

17:47.940 --> 17:49.773
(softly knocking at door)

17:49.773 --> 17:50.606
Stace!

17:59.423 --> 18:01.137
- Did I disturb you?

18:01.137 --> 18:03.914
- [Nina] Are you okay, where's Seb?

18:03.914 --> 18:05.747
- Oh, well, he's home.

18:07.526 --> 18:10.859
It's just, he keeps saying these things.

18:11.723 --> 18:12.556
- I know.

18:14.241 --> 18:16.016
- Well, is he on drugs?

18:16.016 --> 18:17.969
Does he owe someone money?

18:17.969 --> 18:19.593
- I couldn't tell you.

18:19.593 --> 18:22.343
- Yeah, well, have you asked him?

18:27.740 --> 18:31.323
(crickets softly chirping)

18:45.589 --> 18:46.839
- Dad send you?

18:50.154 --> 18:51.987
- I wanted to see you.

19:05.940 --> 19:08.440
I do care about you, you know.

19:09.853 --> 19:11.893
- Not enough to believe me.

19:11.893 --> 19:13.143
- Believe what?

19:16.590 --> 19:17.900
Have you taken something?

19:17.900 --> 19:19.592
- Yeah, I'm on some mad trip.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.060
- Can you stop?

19:21.060 --> 19:22.365
- Stop what?

19:22.365 --> 19:25.698
- Making out like this is some big joke.

19:26.574 --> 19:28.324
We're worried about you.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.967
- I don't know what else to say.

19:36.805 --> 19:38.638
I just blinked, and...

19:45.934 --> 19:50.517
- He actually believes he's
disappearing into thin air.

19:53.475 --> 19:55.392
He needs help, Michael.

19:59.034 --> 20:00.534
- All right, well,

20:01.818 --> 20:05.543
just keep him talking
and, keep an eye on him.

20:05.543 --> 20:08.043
Don't let him disappear again.

20:12.026 --> 20:14.633
- [Nina] Do you remember that
dinner at your dad's place?

20:14.633 --> 20:17.343
- Like it was yesterday.

20:17.343 --> 20:18.923
- You kept going on about
how you're gonna pick up lots

20:18.923 --> 20:20.387
of groupies on the road.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.530
- That was you.

20:21.530 --> 20:22.363
- Sure.

20:26.732 --> 20:30.442
You can tell me if that's
what happened, you know.

20:30.442 --> 20:34.775
- Do you really think I
would have left without you?

20:37.190 --> 20:38.023
(ominous music)
- [Paramedic] What's him name?

20:38.023 --> 20:38.862
- Sebastian.

20:38.862 --> 20:39.695
- [Paramedic] Don't worry

20:39.695 --> 20:42.128
we handle these situations all the time.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.630
- [Nina] Hey, give me that.

20:55.542 --> 20:57.355
Seb--
- Did you know about this?

20:57.355 --> 20:58.985
- No, don't panic, Seb!

20:58.985 --> 20:59.818
- Seb!
- Stop!

20:59.818 --> 21:01.917
- [Michael] It's for your own good Seb!

21:01.917 --> 21:04.584
(ominous music)

21:24.653 --> 21:27.986
(birds softly chirping)

21:29.508 --> 21:30.591
- [Nina] Hey.

21:31.589 --> 21:33.385
- What are you doing here?

21:33.385 --> 21:35.552
- I was worried about you.

21:37.695 --> 21:42.554
- You know, you're the one
person that needed to believe me.

21:42.554 --> 21:43.444
- Maybe I would believe you

21:43.444 --> 21:46.777
if what you were saying wasn't so crazy.

21:50.633 --> 21:53.883
Please, can you just come back with me?

21:56.727 --> 21:57.990
Honestly,
(beat softly clashes)

21:57.990 --> 21:59.652
I don't even know what--

21:59.652 --> 22:02.812
(ominous music)

22:02.812 --> 22:03.645
Seb?

22:06.021 --> 22:08.104
Seb, stop mucking around.

22:14.223 --> 22:15.056
Seb?

22:25.369 --> 22:30.369
(beats softly pulsating)
(birds softly chirping)

22:30.539 --> 22:32.226
I gave this to him a year ago.

22:32.226 --> 22:33.059
- So what?

22:33.059 --> 22:34.293
- It's the proof!

22:34.293 --> 22:35.126
- Proof of what?
- It's proof he's telling,

22:35.126 --> 22:36.097
he's telling the truth!
- Proof of what?

22:36.097 --> 22:36.930
The truth?
- I'm telling you,

22:36.930 --> 22:38.267
I think he's telling the truth.

22:38.267 --> 22:39.449
- I'll tell you what the truth is.

22:39.449 --> 22:42.449
There's something going on, just go!

22:45.533 --> 22:46.763
You still here?

22:46.763 --> 22:50.013
(cars softly rustling)

22:59.559 --> 23:00.536
- [Policeman] There
was no one else around,

23:00.536 --> 23:01.760
you were the only one who saw this happen?

23:01.760 --> 23:03.658
- Yes, how many times do
we have to go through this?

23:03.658 --> 23:07.103
(people softly chattering)

23:07.103 --> 23:08.936
- All right, listen,

23:09.880 --> 23:11.431
we've decided we're just gonna
let you off with a warning

23:11.431 --> 23:13.342
this time.
- A warning, what for?

23:13.342 --> 23:16.072
- [Policewoman] Wasting police
time is a serious matter.

23:16.072 --> 23:18.651
- [Policeman] Look, we've
spoken to Sebastian's father.

23:18.651 --> 23:20.581
We understand emotions are running high

23:20.581 --> 23:22.015
in the family at the moment, so--

23:22.015 --> 23:24.296
- Okay, okay, I'm telling the truth.

23:24.296 --> 23:26.542
- Look, we're not even
gonna file a report, okay?

23:26.542 --> 23:27.991
So let's just end this now.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.783
Come on, you're free to go.

23:30.783 --> 23:31.616
- Fine.

23:35.797 --> 23:37.199
- Hey, Nina?

23:37.199 --> 23:38.826
Hey.

23:38.826 --> 23:40.227
(Nina softly whimpers)

23:40.227 --> 23:41.310
What's wrong?

23:44.191 --> 23:45.774
- [Nina] It's um...

23:48.977 --> 23:51.419
Just Seb stuff.

23:52.622 --> 23:54.950
- [Stacey] Didn't you
guys go out last night?

23:54.950 --> 23:55.783
Did you--
- Mm-hm.

23:55.783 --> 23:59.773
- [Stacey] Talk about
things, what's going on?

23:59.773 --> 24:01.273
- We hung out but,

24:02.639 --> 24:04.314
I don't know.

24:04.314 --> 24:05.893
I don't know when I'm gonna see him again.

24:05.893 --> 24:08.240
- Aw, Neens, hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:08.240 --> 24:13.201
(Nina softly sobbing)
Aw, babe, I'm sorry.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.034
Can you try and tell me about it?

24:14.034 --> 24:15.255
What happened?
- I'm being so (mumbles)

24:15.255 --> 24:19.037
- No, you're not at all, not at all.

24:19.037 --> 24:21.287
Did he say where he's been?

24:22.432 --> 24:26.432
So are you back together,
is he sticking around?

24:28.495 --> 24:31.245
- He's just been traveling a lot.

24:33.856 --> 24:36.523
(ominous music)

24:58.395 --> 25:00.812
(soft music)

25:54.218 --> 25:55.891
- Maybe I am going nuts.

25:55.891 --> 25:58.502
- Hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay!

25:58.502 --> 26:00.277
It's all right, I believe you.

26:00.277 --> 26:01.527
It's all right.

26:08.250 --> 26:11.417
- I can't believe that happened again.

26:14.264 --> 26:15.847
- Do you feel okay?

26:20.549 --> 26:23.466
What's the last thing you remember?

26:25.597 --> 26:27.971
- I was just here with you.

26:27.971 --> 26:31.304
(birds softly chirping)

26:36.173 --> 26:37.006
A year.

26:39.507 --> 26:40.340
Hey.

26:49.484 --> 26:50.330
How is this happening?
- I don't know how

26:50.330 --> 26:51.543
it's happening, could just--
- Why?

26:51.543 --> 26:53.100
- I don't know, I don't know.

26:53.100 --> 26:55.506
I don't know, but it is, Seb, please--

26:55.506 --> 26:56.706
- Stop telling me to calm down, please!

26:56.706 --> 26:58.789
- Okay.
- It doesn't help.

27:02.412 --> 27:03.745
What's happened?

27:05.475 --> 27:08.392
How are you, how's my dad, how's...

27:13.584 --> 27:14.417
What?

27:16.092 --> 27:17.259
What happened?

27:20.889 --> 27:22.460
- Your dad got into a bit of trouble.

27:22.460 --> 27:23.293
- When?

27:33.929 --> 27:35.179
- How'd you go?

27:39.163 --> 27:40.140
- Wait here.

27:40.140 --> 27:41.390
- Are you sure?

27:57.084 --> 27:58.084
- [Seb] Dad?

28:02.106 --> 28:04.106
Do you wanna talk to me?

28:05.194 --> 28:06.777
- What's the point?

28:07.823 --> 28:10.207
- The hell's wrong with you?

28:10.207 --> 28:12.040
- I'm wonderful, mate.

28:13.523 --> 28:14.690
- [Seb] Don't!

28:16.096 --> 28:18.929
- [Michael] Look what you've done!

28:21.004 --> 28:23.421
You're just like your mother.

28:35.457 --> 28:36.290
- [Nina] What happened?

28:36.290 --> 28:37.123
- [Seb] Nothing.

28:37.123 --> 28:39.873
- No, what did he say?
- I'm fine.

29:11.006 --> 29:11.839
- Hey.

29:19.578 --> 29:20.578
You're okay?

29:21.441 --> 29:22.858
- Mm-hm.
- Really?

29:28.594 --> 29:29.427
What?

29:30.281 --> 29:33.864
- Just feel like I'm
gonna lose everything.

29:35.241 --> 29:38.074
- You're not, you've still got me.

29:39.871 --> 29:41.121
- For how long?

29:49.516 --> 29:51.924
Have you told anyone?

29:51.924 --> 29:52.924
- About you?

29:55.064 --> 29:56.409
It's weird, what am I supposed to say?

29:56.409 --> 30:00.337
That you're like randomly
disappearing and reappearing.

30:00.337 --> 30:01.396
- Could we not go to the cops?

30:01.396 --> 30:03.230
- Uh, no way.

30:03.230 --> 30:04.063
- Why not?

30:04.063 --> 30:05.646
They've gotta help.

30:07.155 --> 30:07.988
- Seb!
- Why?

30:07.988 --> 30:09.732
- Just trust me, okay?

30:09.732 --> 30:10.565
- Don't!

30:10.565 --> 30:12.564
- [Nina] Listen, I've tried!

30:12.564 --> 30:13.402
- I'll explain!

30:13.402 --> 30:14.235
- What?

30:14.235 --> 30:15.068
They'll think you're crazy!

30:15.068 --> 30:15.901
They'll lock you up and put you

30:15.901 --> 30:16.734
in the psych ward or something!

30:16.734 --> 30:18.859
- [Seb] What else am I supposed to do?

30:18.859 --> 30:20.992
- Just come home.

30:20.992 --> 30:22.596
- Which is where?

30:22.596 --> 30:23.513
- My place.

30:30.143 --> 30:33.726
(crickets softly chirping)

30:38.662 --> 30:39.495
What?

30:40.773 --> 30:41.606
- Nothing.

30:43.094 --> 30:45.511
- You're looking at me weird.

30:47.644 --> 30:49.487
- You look different.

30:49.487 --> 30:51.543
- Are you saying I look old?

30:51.543 --> 30:54.876
- No, just different.

30:57.682 --> 31:00.099
- Well, a year's a long time.

31:02.504 --> 31:03.337
- Yeah.

31:10.605 --> 31:12.272
I don't wanna leave.

31:14.858 --> 31:17.858
- We don't know that's gonna happen.

31:25.118 --> 31:27.353
- Will you be here when I get back?

31:27.353 --> 31:28.520
If I go again?

31:33.205 --> 31:34.038
- Mm-hm.

31:37.797 --> 31:39.464
- You don't have to.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.496
- No, I want to.

31:59.169 --> 32:01.502
- I don't wanna go to sleep.

32:02.469 --> 32:03.469
- Me either.

32:10.145 --> 32:13.478
(birds softly chirping)

32:26.001 --> 32:28.175
- [Stacey] You're not going to work today?

32:28.175 --> 32:30.592
- Yeah, I'm not really feeling that well.

32:30.592 --> 32:35.592
- (softly giggles) Didn't get
enough sleep, more like it.

32:36.270 --> 32:38.008
- Seb was over.

32:38.008 --> 32:39.068
- Like, Seb Seb?

32:39.068 --> 32:39.901
- Uh-huh.

32:42.177 --> 32:45.239
- Does that mean you guys are back on?

32:45.239 --> 32:46.552
- Guess so.

32:46.552 --> 32:48.916
- Well, that's good news, right?

32:48.916 --> 32:49.749
- Yep.

32:53.300 --> 32:57.396
- Well, maybe we should
all go hang out sometime.

32:57.396 --> 32:59.313
- You're gonna be late.

33:01.203 --> 33:02.476
- See ya, Neens.

33:02.476 --> 33:03.309
- See you.

- Yes, you're coming out with me,

34:03.996 --> 34:05.222
come on, just you and me.
- No, I don't feel like it.

34:05.222 --> 34:07.304
- Aw, what, you don't
wanna dance with this?

34:07.304 --> 34:08.570
You don't wanna dance with this?

34:08.570 --> 34:10.521
(Nina softly chuckles)

34:10.521 --> 34:14.414
(upbeat electronica music)
(patrons softly chattering)

34:14.414 --> 34:16.226
Do you do like an espresso martini?

34:16.226 --> 34:18.695
- No, I don't want it, can I
just get a vodka lime and soda?

34:18.695 --> 34:19.612
- Yeah.
- What?

34:19.612 --> 34:20.594
No, get a cocktail!

34:20.594 --> 34:22.190
- Martini sounds good.

34:22.190 --> 34:23.107
- It's nice and light.

34:23.107 --> 34:24.446
- Oh, hang on, wait,
it's got tequila in it,

34:24.446 --> 34:26.618
I can't have that, that
makes me really sick.

34:26.618 --> 34:27.885
- Hey!
- Hey.

34:27.885 --> 34:28.717
- Hello.

34:30.139 --> 34:31.027
Good to see you.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.063
(softly smooches)
- You too.

34:32.063 --> 34:32.897
- Hey, you all right?
- Hi, Kurt.

34:32.897 --> 34:33.813
Yeah, yeah.
- You good?

34:33.813 --> 34:34.646
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

34:34.646 --> 34:37.608
- Okay, good.
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

34:37.608 --> 34:38.446
- Hi, hey.
- Hi.

34:38.446 --> 34:39.279
- Oh, hey, hey.
- Hi.

34:39.279 --> 34:41.138
- [Stacey] Hey, Ryan,
Ryan, Nina, Nina, Ryan.

34:41.138 --> 34:41.971
- [Ryan] I'm Ryan.

34:41.971 --> 34:42.804
- It's nice to meet you.

34:42.804 --> 34:43.637
- Nice to meet you,
what's your name, sorry?

34:43.637 --> 34:44.469
- Nina.

34:44.469 --> 34:45.303
- Nina.
- Yeah.

34:45.303 --> 34:46.136
- [Stacey] Ryan's a doctor.

34:46.136 --> 34:46.969
- Okay.
- I'm a junior doctor.

34:46.969 --> 34:48.844
- Oh, that's nice.
- And he's single!

34:48.844 --> 34:50.655
- I'm at the Alfred.

34:50.655 --> 34:51.487
- Are you?

34:51.487 --> 34:52.321
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:52.321 --> 34:53.190
- Okay, that's good.

34:53.190 --> 34:54.023
- Thank you.

34:54.023 --> 34:54.998
- What ward do you work in?

34:54.998 --> 34:56.563
- I work at the cardiac ward.

34:56.563 --> 34:57.396
- Okay, cool.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.160
- Yeah, get to see a whole load of stuff.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.075
What about you, what do you--

35:00.075 --> 35:01.083
- Sorry, I've gotta go.

35:01.083 --> 35:02.151
- Okay.
- I'm really sorry.

35:02.151 --> 35:02.984
It was lovely to meet you.
- All right.

35:02.984 --> 35:04.234
- Okay.
- Nina!

35:06.445 --> 35:09.528
(muffled bass beats)

35:10.836 --> 35:11.825
What are you doing?

35:11.825 --> 35:12.661
- What do you think?

35:12.661 --> 35:14.231
Docklands Drive.

35:14.231 --> 35:15.064
Yeah, hey!

35:15.914 --> 35:17.664
- What's the problem?

35:18.747 --> 35:20.223
- What?

35:20.223 --> 35:22.104
- You're unbelievable.

35:22.104 --> 35:22.971
- What's that supposed to mean?

35:22.971 --> 35:24.670
- Ryan is totally into you.

35:24.670 --> 35:26.126
- So?

35:26.126 --> 35:28.255
In case you've forgotten,
I have a boyfriend.

35:28.255 --> 35:29.088
- Right.

35:31.267 --> 35:33.865
No, I'm sorry, it's just...

35:33.865 --> 35:36.851
I'm not sure showing up once
a year really qualifies.

35:36.851 --> 35:38.194
- Okay, yeah, you just don't get it

35:38.194 --> 35:39.127
because you've never had a relationship

35:39.127 --> 35:40.742
that's lasted more than five minutes.

35:40.742 --> 35:42.273
- No, I don't get it, Neen.

35:42.273 --> 35:45.433
This guy is fucking AWOL
and I am your friend, okay?

35:45.433 --> 35:47.472
You need to get out, have some fun!

35:47.472 --> 35:48.411
- Okay, you're making it sound

35:48.411 --> 35:49.926
like I'm totally crazy, when I'm not.

35:49.926 --> 35:52.673
I'm fine, just because I'm
not super happy all the time.

35:52.673 --> 35:53.781
- Well, look, you know what?

35:53.781 --> 35:54.767
No offense, but it's really awkward

35:54.767 --> 35:57.388
bringing people around, okay?

35:57.388 --> 35:58.280
- Thanks.

35:58.280 --> 35:59.168
- Look, what is so wrong with

35:59.168 --> 36:00.799
just getting to know a couple of guys

36:00.799 --> 36:03.070
and letting them buy us some drinks?

36:03.070 --> 36:06.487
Come on, we used to do this all the time.

36:09.595 --> 36:12.012
(soft music)

36:57.505 --> 36:59.577
(softly knocking on door)

36:59.577 --> 37:00.637
- [Nina] Hey, did you wanna see me?

37:00.637 --> 37:03.177
- Yeah, yeah, come in.

37:03.177 --> 37:04.010
How are you?

37:04.010 --> 37:05.328
- Hey, yeah, good, what's going on?

37:05.328 --> 37:06.984
- I just wanted to talk to you.

37:06.984 --> 37:07.817
- [Nina] Okay.

37:07.817 --> 37:10.850
- I just received a call from Miranda.

37:10.850 --> 37:11.683
- [Nina] Yeah?

37:11.683 --> 37:12.683
- Who got the invoices sent.

37:12.683 --> 37:13.689
- [Nina] Yeah, yeah.

37:13.689 --> 37:15.600
- But it was the wrong invoice,

37:15.600 --> 37:17.854
it was Jackie, Jackie's invoice.

37:17.854 --> 37:19.681
- Are you serious?

37:19.681 --> 37:21.848
Oh, God, oh, I'm so sorry!

37:24.445 --> 37:25.963
- Yeah, well, I mean, the thing is,

37:25.963 --> 37:27.067
I've been noticing lately

37:27.067 --> 37:29.541
that you just haven't
been yourself, at all.

37:29.541 --> 37:34.353
'Cause you're normally so
perky, and happy, and focused.

37:34.353 --> 37:37.067
You've been the opposite
of all those things lately,

37:37.067 --> 37:38.806
and it's worried me.

37:38.806 --> 37:41.216
- I'm so sorry, I just,

37:41.216 --> 37:45.085
I've just been so tired lately, yeah.

37:45.085 --> 37:45.918
- Well...

37:46.838 --> 37:49.739
If you ever want anyone to
talk to, you can talk to me.

37:49.739 --> 37:53.623
- I think I just need to
get on top of my sleep.

37:53.623 --> 37:56.206
And I will do that, but thanks.

37:57.742 --> 38:01.405
- I'll handle this anyway,
don't worry about it, it's fine.

38:01.405 --> 38:06.405
(soft indie rock music)
(patrons softly chattering)

38:12.092 --> 38:13.788
- My God, I'm gonna kill you.

38:13.788 --> 38:15.062
Don't, I know what you're laughing at.

38:15.062 --> 38:15.895
- I left you there.

38:15.895 --> 38:16.728
- Yes, you left me there.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.943
I cannot believe that Johnny's so boring.

38:18.943 --> 38:20.905
- Yeah, well, you know, I
didn't wanna deal with him,

38:20.905 --> 38:22.001
so I left you with him.

38:22.001 --> 38:24.806
- Yeah, I know, thanks a
lot for that, jerk, jesus.

38:24.806 --> 38:26.418
oh my God, I would love
a burger right now.

38:26.418 --> 38:28.927
- Yeah, I'm starving actually.
- That would be so good, aw!

38:28.927 --> 38:31.589
- Let's go get something, I
don't wanna be here anymore.

38:31.589 --> 38:35.239
Let's finish this and
go, what do you reckon?

38:35.239 --> 38:38.169
- I actually can't, I've to,

38:38.169 --> 38:41.941
I've gotta go home, so, why
don't you (clicks tongue)

38:41.941 --> 38:43.261
finish this little guy for me--

38:43.261 --> 38:44.245
- [Jake] Oh, you're leaving now?

38:44.245 --> 38:46.839
- And, yeah, I've got to, I've got a,

38:46.839 --> 38:48.960
I've got a Skype session
with my boyfriend, so--

38:48.960 --> 38:50.173
- Yeah, all right.
- So, I've gotta go,

38:50.173 --> 38:53.167
but I will see you at work tomorrow.

38:53.167 --> 38:55.462
Bright and early, no two-hour breaks.

38:55.462 --> 38:58.545
- See you tomorrow, all right.
- Yeah.

39:12.748 --> 39:14.150
Alrighty.
- All right.

39:14.150 --> 39:15.255
- Cool.
- Such a nice day.

39:15.255 --> 39:16.200
- Yeah.
- We should be in the park,

39:16.200 --> 39:17.609
not in the shopping center.

39:17.609 --> 39:18.544
- I know, right, you know what?

39:18.544 --> 39:19.567
We should totally go and do that

39:19.567 --> 39:21.447
after we drop these guys at home.

39:21.447 --> 39:23.384
- I've got--
- Get some chow, and--

39:23.384 --> 39:24.659
- Um, yeah.
- Go to the park?

39:24.659 --> 39:26.309
- I've got band practice at 4:30.

39:26.309 --> 39:27.142
- Ah, do you?

39:27.142 --> 39:31.087
- It's three, I mean,
we got a bit of time.

39:31.087 --> 39:32.266
- Nah, you should probably
go to band practice.

39:32.266 --> 39:34.919
I mean, you guys need
all the help you can get.

39:34.919 --> 39:37.548
(Seb loudly clears throat)

39:37.548 --> 39:38.881
Such a nice day.

39:45.354 --> 39:46.466
Oh, hey.
- Hey.

39:46.466 --> 39:47.785
- How'd you go after the other night?

39:47.785 --> 39:49.211
- [Jake] Yeah, good.

39:49.211 --> 39:50.202
- Yeah?
- Good, good, good.

39:50.202 --> 39:51.587
It was a good night, it was a big night.

39:51.587 --> 39:52.743
- Really?

39:52.743 --> 39:53.576
- Yeah.

39:53.576 --> 39:54.636
- Sorry for bailing on you.

39:54.636 --> 39:55.469
- It's okay.

39:55.469 --> 39:57.447
- I feel really bad for doing that.

39:57.447 --> 39:59.419
- Don't worry about it, it's fine.

39:59.419 --> 40:00.919
- I kinda wanna make it up to you.

40:00.919 --> 40:03.031
- You don't need to make it up to me.

40:03.031 --> 40:04.858
- Yeah, I think I do.

40:04.858 --> 40:08.047
Do you wanna maybe get lunch
or something this week?

40:08.047 --> 40:08.940
- Like a work lunch?

40:08.940 --> 40:09.900
- Yeah.

40:09.900 --> 40:10.775
- Professional work lunch?

40:10.775 --> 40:14.089
- Yes, very professional work lunch.

40:14.089 --> 40:15.292
- Yeah, I'll have lunch with you.

40:15.292 --> 40:16.157
- Okay, cool.

40:16.157 --> 40:17.643
- I'll send you a calendar invite.

40:17.643 --> 40:19.950
- Ooh, profesh. (laughs)
- (chuckles) Yeah.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.823
- All right, well, I
better get back to work.

40:21.823 --> 40:23.478
- [Jake] You get back to work, slacker.

40:23.478 --> 40:25.108
(Nina softly chuckles)

40:25.108 --> 40:27.244
- Ooh, I got a couple good ones here.

40:27.244 --> 40:29.034
- What are you looking at?

40:29.034 --> 40:30.102
- Shoes.

40:30.102 --> 40:31.318
- Uh-huh.
- On eBay.

40:31.318 --> 40:32.460
- For work?

40:32.460 --> 40:35.436
- No, for running, I'm gonna get fit.

40:35.436 --> 40:37.285
- Ooh, okay.
- Yeah.

40:37.285 --> 40:41.355
- Hey, if you want shoes (tongue clicks)

40:41.355 --> 40:43.297
do a little walkity-walk for me

40:43.297 --> 40:46.161
and I can tell you
which ones will be good.

40:46.161 --> 40:46.994
- I'm not doing that.

40:46.994 --> 40:48.423
- (laughs) Why, are you embarrassed?

40:48.423 --> 40:49.256
- Yeah.

40:49.256 --> 40:50.089
- Do it.
(chuckling)

40:50.089 --> 40:52.482
Do it, there's only
like 20 people in here.

40:52.482 --> 40:55.149
- Just walk up and down?
- Mm-hm.

40:56.222 --> 40:57.460
- And then you'll tell
me what shoes to wear?

40:57.460 --> 40:59.127
- Mm-hm.
- All right.

41:05.188 --> 41:08.253
Race you to the steps, yes!
(Nina laughing)

41:08.253 --> 41:11.574
- You said you weren't a runner!

41:11.574 --> 41:14.757
All right, I'm just gonna leave you there.

41:14.757 --> 41:15.907
Aw, god.

41:15.907 --> 41:16.740
- You gotta lift.

41:16.740 --> 41:18.099
- I was lifting my knees,

41:18.099 --> 41:19.314
but it helps when you're like

41:19.314 --> 41:21.625
a million feet taller than I am.

41:21.625 --> 41:23.128
- You gotta get some better gear.

41:23.128 --> 41:24.344
- What are you talking about?

41:24.344 --> 41:26.424
- Well, these runners, look at this.

41:26.424 --> 41:27.611
- What's wrong with this?

41:27.611 --> 41:28.444
- It's inappropriate.

41:28.444 --> 41:29.277
- It's not inappropriate.

41:29.277 --> 41:32.110
- It's a little bit inappropriate.

41:37.164 --> 41:39.041
Sorry, should I not have done that?

41:39.041 --> 41:41.458
(soft music)

41:44.966 --> 41:46.086
Sure it's okay to take a shower?

41:46.086 --> 41:48.062
- Yeah, yeah, it's just straight upstairs,

41:48.062 --> 41:50.062
first door on your left.

41:51.343 --> 41:52.326
- Cool.

41:52.326 --> 41:53.159
- Cool.

41:53.159 --> 41:55.381
Hey, is full cream milk all right?

41:55.381 --> 41:58.194
- Do you have almond milk?

41:58.194 --> 41:59.881
- What, are you allergic?

41:59.881 --> 42:02.479
- No, I just prefer almond milk.

42:02.479 --> 42:05.351
- No (laughs) I don't have almond milk.

42:05.351 --> 42:06.350
- Oh.

42:06.350 --> 42:08.622
Very disappointed with you, then.

42:08.622 --> 42:11.747
- Yeah (softly mumbles)

42:11.747 --> 42:14.164
(soft music)

42:43.583 --> 42:47.363
- I like how one part of
the ceiling is not painted,

42:47.363 --> 42:50.074
whilst the rest of it
is very well painted.

42:50.074 --> 42:52.523
- I know, do you know how
hard it was for me to do that?

42:52.523 --> 42:55.217
I didn't have a tall
person like you helping me.

42:55.217 --> 42:58.281
My arms got tired by the
time I got to that bit.

42:58.281 --> 42:59.773
- Yes, you just gave up.

42:59.773 --> 43:00.606
- Yeah.

43:00.606 --> 43:02.883
- Oh, well, maybe sometime I'll come round

43:02.883 --> 43:04.478
and help you finish it off.

43:04.478 --> 43:05.645
- Yeah, maybe.

43:10.888 --> 43:12.229
Hey, you're not gonna,

43:12.229 --> 43:14.847
you're not gonna tell
people about this, are you?

43:14.847 --> 43:16.393
- [Jake] About this?

43:16.393 --> 43:17.893
- Yes, about this.

43:19.673 --> 43:20.931
- I've got it at the top of my

43:20.931 --> 43:22.794
agenda on Monday's WIP sheet

43:22.794 --> 43:24.639
- Shut up! (loudly laughing)

43:24.639 --> 43:26.655
That's so, don't even joke about that,

43:26.655 --> 43:28.405
that's so ridiculous.

43:32.811 --> 43:36.644
It'd just be really
awkward at work, you know?

43:38.854 --> 43:41.472
- Well, we don't have
to do this again at all,

43:41.472 --> 43:42.340
if you don't want to.

43:42.340 --> 43:43.704
I understand if you wanna keep it

43:43.704 --> 43:46.209
(softly clears throat)
like a one-time thing.

43:46.209 --> 43:49.542
- No, that's not what I meant, I just...

43:50.479 --> 43:51.562
Just think...

43:52.972 --> 43:57.222
It'd be really good if we
could keep things casual.

43:58.225 --> 44:01.170
- Yes, yeah, we can do that.

44:01.170 --> 44:03.267
- Okay.
- Can just keep it caszh.

44:03.267 --> 44:04.100
- Yeah.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.947
- Just keep it caszh.

45:00.624 --> 45:02.941

- Does it affect me?

45:03.864 --> 45:06.592
- Mm-hm, yeah.
- What is it?

45:06.592 --> 45:07.557
Tell me what it is.

45:07.557 --> 45:09.539
- I've just booked two
flights to India for us.

45:09.539 --> 45:10.588
- Did you?
- Yeah, yeah.

45:10.588 --> 45:13.070
- Oh my god, that's so exciting!

45:13.070 --> 45:15.081
- They had a special of half price.

45:15.081 --> 45:16.639
- Oh my god, oh is that it?

45:16.639 --> 45:19.900
- Yeah, for March 7 to 21st.
- Oh, that's so cheap.

45:19.900 --> 45:22.934
- It was the only time they offered that.

45:22.934 --> 45:24.381
Lucky!
- Yeah.

45:24.381 --> 45:27.735
Do I even have any annual leave left?

45:27.735 --> 45:29.499
- [Jake] You've got heaps
of leave, I checked.

45:29.499 --> 45:30.578
- Oh, do I?

45:30.578 --> 45:32.423
- Yeah, work's quiet, days of leave.

45:32.423 --> 45:36.249
February always, March and
February, it's always quiet.

45:36.249 --> 45:38.175
- [Nina] It's not really a good time, so.

45:38.175 --> 45:40.591
- What have you got on?
- I just can't do it.

45:40.591 --> 45:41.424
Nothing.

45:42.417 --> 45:44.282
- [Jake] Then why can't you go?

45:44.282 --> 45:45.982
- It's just not a good time, okay?

45:45.982 --> 45:47.255
And anyway, you shouldn't have booked them

45:47.255 --> 45:49.979
without telling me, or
checking with me first.

45:49.979 --> 45:51.328
- Oh, okay, don't worry about it,

45:51.328 --> 45:53.495
we'll talk about it later.

45:58.274 --> 46:01.663
- Hey, can you just wait a sec?

46:01.663 --> 46:03.666
You've been shitty with me all afternoon.

46:03.666 --> 46:05.030
Is this about the trip?

46:05.030 --> 46:06.737
- Yeah, I'm confused by it.

46:06.737 --> 46:08.800
- I just can't go during those dates.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.967
- Why can't you go?

46:10.967 --> 46:13.042
- Can you just get a refund?

46:13.042 --> 46:14.228
- No, they're nonrefundable.

46:14.228 --> 46:16.561
That's why they're so cheap.

46:18.664 --> 46:19.819
- I just can't go, all right?

46:19.819 --> 46:22.849
I've got a friend flying to
Melbourne one of those days,

46:22.849 --> 46:24.461
and I really wanna catch up with them.

46:24.461 --> 46:26.908
They're only here for one night.

46:26.908 --> 46:30.974
- Why couldn't you just
tell me that before?

46:30.974 --> 46:34.962
- 'Cause it's Seb, and I didn't
wanna hurt your feelings.

46:34.962 --> 46:36.281
- Really?

46:36.281 --> 46:40.540
- Yeah, that's, this is exactly
how I thought you'd take it.

46:40.540 --> 46:42.115
- I'm overreacting, am I?

46:42.115 --> 46:43.403
I'm just out of control.

46:43.403 --> 46:44.986
Why are you meeting up with him?

46:44.986 --> 46:46.069
Just out of interest.

46:46.069 --> 46:48.730
- I don't know, because we
used to go out together,

46:48.730 --> 46:51.091
and I just wanna reconnect with him.

46:51.091 --> 46:53.063
- Aw, sorry, maybe I'll go catch up

46:53.063 --> 46:54.946
with my ex-girlfriend
this weekend as well.

46:54.946 --> 46:56.236
- Aw, god, yeah, okay.

46:56.236 --> 46:58.301
- So are you meeting with him as a friend,

46:58.301 --> 46:59.786
or as more than a friend?

46:59.786 --> 47:01.286
- Are you serious?

47:02.664 --> 47:05.081
- What the fuck are we doing?

47:08.601 --> 47:11.803
- I don't know, I don't know what to say.

47:11.803 --> 47:12.636
- Pfft.

47:19.978 --> 47:22.895
(soft piano music)

47:47.130 --> 47:49.143
(bright music)

47:49.143 --> 47:50.299
- Oh, shit!

47:50.299 --> 47:51.873
(Nina laughing)
You coulda told me you

47:51.873 --> 47:56.040
were thinking about moving.
- Sorry, I didn't know.

47:58.340 --> 47:59.173
- [Seb] It's big.

47:59.173 --> 48:00.895
- Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?

48:00.895 --> 48:01.897
- A mosaic.

48:01.897 --> 48:03.638
- Yeah.
- Wow.

48:03.638 --> 48:04.471
- Do you like my courtyard?

48:04.471 --> 48:05.389
- Yeah, it's really nice.

48:05.389 --> 48:06.519
- See that little pond?

48:06.519 --> 48:07.985
It's got fish in it.

48:07.985 --> 48:09.001
- Cool.

48:09.001 --> 48:10.632
- Yeah.

48:10.632 --> 48:12.649
- Wow, how do you afford this?

48:12.649 --> 48:13.566
- Um, well,

48:15.217 --> 48:17.722
I am the new Marketing Manager at work.

48:17.722 --> 48:18.919
- Oh, wow, congratulations.

48:18.919 --> 48:20.210
- Yeah, thanks.

48:20.210 --> 48:22.019
- They must really like you.

48:22.019 --> 48:22.852
- Yeah.

48:24.535 --> 48:26.256
Do you want something to eat?

48:26.256 --> 48:28.323
Not quite sure what I've got.

48:28.323 --> 48:29.349
- I don't mind.

48:29.349 --> 48:31.349
- I mean, not much, but,

48:32.270 --> 48:34.419
do you want a glass of water, or,

48:34.419 --> 48:35.605
I'll give you a glass of water.

48:35.605 --> 48:38.272
Oh, this tap is like so finicky.

48:40.486 --> 48:42.111
Hey.

48:42.111 --> 48:43.361
- [Seb] Thanks.

48:50.372 --> 48:52.263
- Are you okay?

48:52.263 --> 48:53.763
- It's just weird.

48:55.022 --> 48:56.474
- [Nina] What?

48:56.474 --> 48:58.224
- New house, glasses.

48:59.420 --> 49:00.837
A lot to take in.

49:08.325 --> 49:09.166
Fish Bowl.

49:09.166 --> 49:10.618
- Mm-hm, I think it's new.

49:10.618 --> 49:11.451
- Yeah?

49:11.451 --> 49:12.284
- Oh, do you know what else is new?

49:12.284 --> 49:13.311
That joint.

49:13.311 --> 49:14.144
- What is it?

49:14.144 --> 49:16.181
- [Nina] It's a really
fancy Iranian restaurant.

49:16.181 --> 49:18.463
- Iranian?
- Yeah.

49:18.463 --> 49:19.713
No?

49:19.713 --> 49:22.188
(laughs) You're face is saying no.

49:22.188 --> 49:23.111
- Sounds a bit healthy.

49:23.111 --> 49:24.675
- [Nina] It is quite healthy.

49:24.675 --> 49:25.994
- What about burgers?

49:25.994 --> 49:26.827
- Oh, really?

49:26.827 --> 49:29.683
Hm, I don't think I'm in the mood for it.

49:29.683 --> 49:30.618
- What, you're watching your weight?

49:30.618 --> 49:32.319
- No, just trying to be a little bit

49:32.319 --> 49:34.168
more conscious with my health and stuff.

49:34.168 --> 49:36.982
(both chuckling)

49:36.982 --> 49:37.815
- Very good.

49:37.815 --> 49:39.677
- Wait, if I agree, will
you stop giving me shit?

49:39.677 --> 49:40.523
- Yeah.

49:40.523 --> 49:42.097
- All right, all right,
let's go get burgers.

49:42.097 --> 49:43.347
- Burgers, yes.

49:44.293 --> 49:46.243
- Hang on, is this with
every piece of cutlery?

49:46.243 --> 49:47.076
- Yeah.

49:47.076 --> 49:48.641
- How have I never noticed this before?

49:48.641 --> 49:50.667
- You're not observant.
- That's so weird.

49:50.667 --> 49:51.500
- Yeah.

49:52.335 --> 49:55.842
- Sorry, but I can't, I cannot deal

49:55.842 --> 49:58.542
with how you're eating
that, it's so weird,

49:58.542 --> 50:01.960
you look so fonzy, like
some posh dude from Toorak.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.752
(laughs) Don't do that.

50:03.752 --> 50:05.301
Can you just touch it?

50:05.301 --> 50:07.503
- Sometimes I have to use my lips.

50:07.503 --> 50:08.793
It's not like I can't.

50:08.793 --> 50:09.921
- Can you just do it for me now?

50:09.921 --> 50:10.754
- All right, one, two.
- Do it.

50:10.754 --> 50:12.927
Aw, did that feel weird and gross and--

50:12.927 --> 50:16.938
(loudly laughing)
- Ahh!

50:16.938 --> 50:19.243
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

50:19.243 --> 50:21.576
Very good.
- You're so weird.

50:23.008 --> 50:25.425
(soft music)

50:46.948 --> 50:48.026
Okay, I'm done.

50:48.026 --> 50:49.151
- Okay.

50:49.151 --> 50:52.311
(both softly laughing)

50:52.311 --> 50:54.701
- I've got lots of fun stuff
for us to do after this.

50:54.701 --> 50:56.254
Thought we can go into the city,

50:56.254 --> 51:00.004
there's these little
markets on by the river.

51:02.022 --> 51:04.972
Ooh, or if we go into St Kilda,

51:04.972 --> 51:09.808
there's a beach DJ, if you
wanna (clicks tongue) dance.

51:09.808 --> 51:10.641
- Whatever.

51:10.641 --> 51:12.700
- What do you mean whatever,
what do you wanna do?

51:12.700 --> 51:15.478
- We can do whatever, as
long as we're hanging out.

51:15.478 --> 51:17.319
You've got some shtuff on--

51:17.319 --> 51:18.520
- (laughs) Do I?

51:18.520 --> 51:19.979
- Yeah, I'll get it.
- Did you get it?

51:19.979 --> 51:21.146
- I'll get it.

51:24.640 --> 51:25.473
What?

51:26.559 --> 51:27.392
- Nothing.

51:30.093 --> 51:33.700
I'm just all herby, they put
lots of herbs on the chips.

51:33.700 --> 51:38.367
- Sorry, you don't have to
kiss me if you don't want to.

51:47.786 --> 51:51.536
(soft acoustic guitar music)

51:54.591 --> 51:56.729
- Yeah, it just takes me,

51:56.729 --> 52:00.229
just takes me a while to get back into it.

52:36.436 --> 52:38.213
What are you doing?

52:38.213 --> 52:39.729
- [Seb] Looking for a drink.

52:39.729 --> 52:41.064
- Oh, okay, I've got some rose.

52:41.064 --> 52:42.849
- No, no.
- It's really good.

52:42.849 --> 52:43.682
- [Nina] No?

52:43.682 --> 52:45.555
- You got anything stronger?

52:45.555 --> 52:48.645
- No, I'm not a bottle shop.

52:48.645 --> 52:49.478
- Nothing?

52:50.601 --> 52:52.310
- No.
- You got spirits or weed?

52:52.310 --> 52:55.477
- [Nina] No, did you not just hear me?

52:56.636 --> 52:59.162
Do you wanna watch a movie or something?

52:59.162 --> 53:02.149
- No, could I use your phone?

53:02.149 --> 53:03.966
- [Nina] Yeah, okay.

53:03.966 --> 53:04.799
- Thanks.

53:16.096 --> 53:18.763
- Are you gonna do that in here?

53:39.183 --> 53:40.516
- Are you awake?

53:54.482 --> 53:56.315
Sorry this is so hard.

54:20.436 --> 54:22.853
(soft music)

55:30.199 --> 55:31.699
- What time is it?

55:33.306 --> 55:34.389
- Who's Jake?

55:36.152 --> 55:36.985
- What?

55:38.299 --> 55:39.382
- Who's Jake?

55:42.970 --> 55:44.220
- He's my boss.

55:45.067 --> 55:47.484
(soft music)

55:48.349 --> 55:50.011
No, wait.

55:50.011 --> 55:50.844
Wait.

55:51.797 --> 55:53.717
Hang on, Seb, just wait.

55:53.717 --> 55:55.017
Seb, stop!

55:55.017 --> 55:56.376
- What, what?
- Just stop,

55:56.376 --> 55:57.697
listen to me, please--
- Get off of me.

55:57.697 --> 55:58.530
- Please talk to me.

55:58.530 --> 55:59.388
- Why didn't you tell me?

55:59.388 --> 56:01.615
- Can you just stop yelling at me, please?

56:01.615 --> 56:04.097
- No, I mean, this obviously isn't working

56:04.097 --> 56:05.214
so you don't have to wait.

56:05.214 --> 56:07.964
- Just stop.
- Just stay, go away.

56:11.781 --> 56:13.562
- Please stop.
- No.

56:13.562 --> 56:16.604
- Why won't you let--
- Just go home!

56:16.604 --> 56:19.021
(soft music)

56:51.779 --> 56:54.446
(ominous music)

56:58.040 --> 56:58.873
Hey, mate.

56:58.873 --> 57:00.623
- That's all?
- Yeah.

57:01.611 --> 57:02.946
- [Store Attendant] $6.80.

57:02.946 --> 57:04.311
- How much?

57:04.311 --> 57:05.144
- Tap.

57:06.786 --> 57:08.435
Declined, mate.

57:08.435 --> 57:09.268
Cash?

57:10.502 --> 57:11.335
- Yeah.

57:18.071 --> 57:19.673
- [Store Attendant] Man, you're short.

57:19.673 --> 57:21.262
- Whatever.

57:21.262 --> 57:23.382
- You cannot take this.

57:23.382 --> 57:24.215
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

57:24.215 --> 57:26.558
- Fuck off, don't touch me!

57:26.558 --> 57:30.357
It's 20 fucking cents,
what does it matter, huh?

57:30.357 --> 57:32.184
- Just relax.
- Why?

57:32.184 --> 57:34.785
Why, don't tell me to fucking relax, huh?

57:34.785 --> 57:36.566
- Okay, okay, man.

57:36.566 --> 57:38.983
(soft music)

58:57.099 --> 59:01.228
- Hey, I've got that
presentation for you to look over

59:01.228 --> 59:02.745
for the meeting tomorrow.

59:02.745 --> 59:06.455
- Great, thank you, I'll look at it later.

59:06.455 --> 59:10.020
- Just pay particular
attention to the, where is it?

59:10.020 --> 59:12.462
To the SEO page 'cause--
- Yeah, I'll look at it--

59:12.462 --> 59:14.604
- Yeah, I know, I'm just letting you know

59:14.604 --> 59:15.986
'cause I've added some extra things

59:15.986 --> 59:17.243
that we hadn't discussed.

59:17.243 --> 59:19.237
- I can't right now, I will
look at it at some point.

59:19.237 --> 59:21.820
Thanks for delivering it to me.

59:24.614 --> 59:27.726
- I'm really sorry about what happened.

59:27.726 --> 59:29.207
- And I don't want to talk
about anything personal.

59:29.207 --> 59:30.229
You wanna talk about work stuff,

59:30.229 --> 59:31.493
talk about work stuff and that's it.

59:31.493 --> 59:34.576
Everything else, keep it to yourself.

01:00:15.439 --> 01:00:16.272
- Hey.

01:00:20.814 --> 01:00:23.605
- [Jake] It's in New Zealand.

01:00:23.605 --> 01:00:24.772
- [Nina] Okay.

01:00:26.023 --> 01:00:29.106
- It's in New Zealand for six months.

01:00:30.402 --> 01:00:32.422
And I haven't said yes yet 'cause,

01:00:32.422 --> 01:00:34.339
I know what that means.

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:39.940
- Well, it's a really
good opportunity, so...

01:00:47.961 --> 01:00:50.544
- Maybe you could come with me.

01:00:55.686 --> 01:00:57.841
- Oh, wow, it looks so different in here.

01:00:57.841 --> 01:00:59.591
- Yeah, it's so bare.

01:01:01.182 --> 01:01:02.015
- Yeah.

01:01:06.054 --> 01:01:08.775
Sorry I'm not coming with you.

01:01:08.775 --> 01:01:09.894
- Are you sorry?

01:01:09.894 --> 01:01:11.153
- Yeah.

01:01:11.153 --> 01:01:12.736
- Eh, I don't know.

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:19.905
Feels to me like you were,
you were never in this.

01:01:19.905 --> 01:01:21.931
You were never in this.

01:01:21.931 --> 01:01:25.335
You just kind of used
to me to fill some void

01:01:25.335 --> 01:01:27.387
that this other guy had left.

01:01:27.387 --> 01:01:29.196
- Yeah, it's not as simple as that.

01:01:29.196 --> 01:01:31.408
- That's pretty simple.

01:01:31.408 --> 01:01:35.463
If you wanna be with someone
you find a way to make it work.

01:01:35.463 --> 01:01:37.130
You just find a way.

01:01:38.307 --> 01:01:42.187
(shoes loudly clattering)

01:01:42.187 --> 01:01:44.550
- Oh my god, you are so super cute!

01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:45.613
- Happy Birthday!

01:01:45.613 --> 01:01:46.850
- Thank you.

01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:48.621
- All right, make a wish!

01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:50.116
Come on.
- Oh my god.

01:01:50.116 --> 01:01:51.886
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

01:01:51.886 --> 01:01:53.459
- Got it?

01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:55.418
- Mm-hm.
- All right.

01:01:55.418 --> 01:02:00.168
(loudly laughing)
- You are such a jerk.

01:02:20.867 --> 01:02:21.700
Hey.

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:22.675
- Hey.
- Hey, Nina.

01:02:22.675 --> 01:02:24.188
- Nina, nice to meet you.
- Hey,

01:02:24.188 --> 01:02:25.275
nice to meet you too.

01:02:25.275 --> 01:02:26.627
Should we go get a drink?

01:02:26.627 --> 01:02:28.303
- Yeah, do you have anywhere in mind?

01:02:28.303 --> 01:02:29.637
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a really good

01:02:29.637 --> 01:02:31.595
space this way.
- Yeah.

01:02:31.595 --> 01:02:34.012
(soft music)

01:02:36.993 --> 01:02:38.189
But I do have a story about this

01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:41.058
(laughing)

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:43.216
- I'm gonna show you my
favorite alleyway in Melbourne.

01:02:43.216 --> 01:02:44.799
- Right.
- This one.

01:02:48.809 --> 01:02:51.726
(soft piano music)

01:03:02.215 --> 01:03:06.048
(loudly coughing and gagging)

01:03:17.434 --> 01:03:19.332
Uh, because I have to work.

01:03:19.332 --> 01:03:20.165
- So?

01:03:20.165 --> 01:03:22.439
We're leaving on Friday
night, you should come.

01:03:22.439 --> 01:03:24.018
- Hey, it's a little thing
called Jake's just left

01:03:24.018 --> 01:03:25.865
and I've inherited half his clients.

01:03:25.865 --> 01:03:26.742
- So?

01:03:26.742 --> 01:03:30.462
- Unlike you, I can't
afford to go freelance.

01:03:30.462 --> 01:03:33.393
(soft music)

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:34.542
- It's cool right?
- This is amazing!

01:03:34.542 --> 01:03:38.626
You didn't tell me she was loaded, Jesus!

01:03:38.626 --> 01:03:40.098
- Yeah, just keep on going--
- This is awesome.

01:03:40.098 --> 01:03:41.002
- Up here, straight ahead.

01:03:41.002 --> 01:03:41.835
- Which one?

01:03:41.835 --> 01:03:43.672
- Yeah, just here.
- Awesome.

01:03:43.672 --> 01:03:46.089
(soft music)

01:03:54.482 --> 01:03:55.482
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:03:56.596 --> 01:03:57.596
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:01.115
- Hey, nice to meet you, good to see ya.

01:04:01.115 --> 01:04:02.019
You must be Lee.

01:04:02.019 --> 01:04:03.866
- [Lee] Yeah, mate, nice to meet ya.

01:04:03.866 --> 01:04:05.208
(guys softly chattering)
- Hi.

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:06.310
- Hey.

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.524
Didn't know you were coming.

01:04:08.524 --> 01:04:09.357
- Yeah.

01:04:11.786 --> 01:04:16.786
(chattering and laughing)
(bright music)

01:04:32.894 --> 01:04:35.406
Aw, look how cute they are!

01:04:35.406 --> 01:04:38.239
They're like following each other.

01:04:39.098 --> 01:04:42.169
It'd be so sweet to have a joint up here.

01:04:42.169 --> 01:04:45.318
As is a place, not an actual joint. Well..

01:04:45.318 --> 01:04:46.185
- Yeah.

01:04:46.185 --> 01:04:48.934
- If you were loaded,
which house would you buy?

01:04:48.934 --> 01:04:50.267
- I like these ones altogether.

01:04:50.267 --> 01:04:51.100
- All of them?
- Yeah.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:52.678
- You'd buy all of them.
- I'd buy all of them.

01:04:52.678 --> 01:04:56.006
Probably, like that one
down there, being that--

01:04:56.006 --> 01:04:56.839
- The biggest one.

01:04:56.839 --> 01:04:58.089
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:04:59.422 --> 01:05:01.472
It's weird, I can see you hesitating.

01:05:01.472 --> 01:05:03.555
- Yeah, it's weird, um...

01:05:05.326 --> 01:05:06.948
How long do you have?

01:05:06.948 --> 01:05:08.763
- What, is it a really long boring story,

01:05:08.763 --> 01:05:10.029
like all the other breakup stories?

01:05:10.029 --> 01:05:10.862
- Yes.

01:05:10.862 --> 01:05:12.838
(laughing)
- Is it? God.

01:05:12.838 --> 01:05:15.798
- It's complicated, I
shoulda seen it coming.

01:05:15.798 --> 01:05:19.430
- Were you guys just
not getting along, or?

01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:22.938
- You just get caught
in a routine, you know?

01:05:22.938 --> 01:05:24.825
- [Stacey] Kinda sounds like you and Seb.

01:05:24.825 --> 01:05:26.810
(laughing)
- No, wait, who's this?

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:28.278
- Okay, this guy would literally show up

01:05:28.278 --> 01:05:31.498
for like one night, and
then just disappear.

01:05:31.498 --> 01:05:32.532
- Why are you telling everyone this?

01:05:32.532 --> 01:05:33.804
- I'm just telling it how it is.

01:05:33.804 --> 01:05:35.929
- That's not how it was
and it's not your thing

01:05:35.929 --> 01:05:37.266
to tell anyway.
- It is how it was,

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:38.674
and we're just all sharing stories.

01:05:38.674 --> 01:05:39.507
- Okay, she doesn't wanna--
- Okay, no, you're--

01:05:39.507 --> 01:05:40.340
- Talk about it.
- Yeah.

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.421
- Guys, let's just chill out.
- Thank you.

01:05:41.421 --> 01:05:42.601
- No, no, no, no--
- No, you're sharing my story.

01:05:42.601 --> 01:05:43.434
- [Stacey] It's only a story.

01:05:43.434 --> 01:05:44.267
- Yeah, you're sharing my story,

01:05:44.267 --> 01:05:45.199
and I don't appreciate it--
- I was there for it.

01:05:45.199 --> 01:05:46.032
- At all.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

01:05:46.032 --> 01:05:47.549
Stace, leave it.
- And it affected you?

01:05:47.549 --> 01:05:48.882
- [Stacey] Yes, it did affect me, Nina.

01:05:48.882 --> 01:05:49.947
It really affected my life.

01:05:49.947 --> 01:05:50.886
- Okay, fuck off, Stacey.

01:05:50.886 --> 01:05:51.787
- No, hey--
- No, I'm done.

01:05:51.787 --> 01:05:53.482
- No, hey, Nina, come on.

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:54.379
Come back.
- Yeah, leave,

01:05:54.379 --> 01:05:55.649
good one, Neens, that's real mature,

01:05:55.649 --> 01:05:56.661
that's gonna help the situation.

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:57.678
- [Hyrry] Stace, would you just chill out?

01:05:57.678 --> 01:05:58.886
- [Stacey] What?

01:05:58.886 --> 01:06:00.219
You brought her.

01:06:02.655 --> 01:06:05.072
(soft music)

01:06:07.288 --> 01:06:08.599
- [Friend] Hey.

01:06:08.599 --> 01:06:10.546
Are you gonna come in and apologize?

01:06:10.546 --> 01:06:14.418
- Yeah, what, wave my magic
wand and make everything better?

01:06:14.418 --> 01:06:16.495
- No, just don't ruin
the weekend for everyone.

01:06:16.495 --> 01:06:19.001
- Sorry if I don't really wanna be here.

01:06:19.001 --> 01:06:21.091
- 'Cause of Stace?

01:06:21.091 --> 01:06:21.924
- Yeah.

01:06:23.964 --> 01:06:25.618
- [Harry] Why did you come then?

01:06:25.618 --> 01:06:27.662
- Because you forced me.

01:06:27.662 --> 01:06:28.560
- [Harry] I love it, you know,

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:31.384
this is exactly what she's talking about.

01:06:31.384 --> 01:06:33.801
(soft music)

01:07:12.586 --> 01:07:14.372
(softly kisses)

01:07:14.372 --> 01:07:16.789
(soft music)

01:07:39.558 --> 01:07:42.058
- What, I thought it was cute.

01:07:42.999 --> 01:07:45.081
- What would I do without you?

01:07:45.081 --> 01:07:48.664
- I don't know, I ask
myself that everyday.

01:09:24.207 --> 01:09:28.892
- The block model suggests
everything is relative.

01:09:28.892 --> 01:09:33.390
Your past could very well
be somebody else's future.

01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:35.808
(soft music)

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:45.053
- [Nina] You know a lot
about time travel, right?

01:09:45.053 --> 01:09:47.220
- Oh, relatively speaking.

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:50.805
- What if it was happening to someone?

01:09:50.805 --> 01:09:52.906
- Oh, then I'd ask them

01:09:52.906 --> 01:09:55.885
to bring me back Einstein's signature.

01:09:55.885 --> 01:10:00.320
- No, I mean like skipping
forward, missing bits.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.321
What if someone was here one
minute and gone the next?

01:10:04.321 --> 01:10:06.711
Just vanishing for months at a time.

01:10:06.711 --> 01:10:09.832
- Are you talking about someone specific?

01:10:09.832 --> 01:10:11.873
- It's my boyfriend, Seb.

01:10:11.873 --> 01:10:12.706
- Oh,

01:10:13.628 --> 01:10:16.529
then I'd suggest that you might want

01:10:16.529 --> 01:10:18.694
to swipe on to the next.

01:10:18.694 --> 01:10:20.510
- It's not like that.

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:22.921
It's really happening.

01:10:22.921 --> 01:10:24.528
- Why don't you come with me

01:10:24.528 --> 01:10:28.070
and we'll go visit the
university counselor.

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:30.320
- What if I could prove it?

01:10:32.472 --> 01:10:34.705
Do you think I'm doing the right thing?

01:10:34.705 --> 01:10:35.622
- Honestly?

01:10:39.212 --> 01:10:40.629
You're miserable.

01:10:41.543 --> 01:10:43.960
(soft music)

01:10:46.425 --> 01:10:47.977
- I just know if we're together,

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:49.977
everything will be fine.

01:10:51.835 --> 01:10:54.252
(soft music)

01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:00.941
(beats softly pulsating)

01:11:00.941 --> 01:11:02.688
(beat softly clashes)

01:11:02.688 --> 01:11:07.688
(soft music)
(birds softly chirping)

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:34.121
Didn't think you'd come back here.

01:12:34.121 --> 01:12:36.121
- Where else would I go?

01:12:39.679 --> 01:12:42.429
Thought you'd moved in with Jake.

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.717
(soft music)

01:12:49.588 --> 01:12:52.481
- You didn't really give
me a chance to explain.

01:12:52.481 --> 01:12:54.648
- Don't have to, I get it.

01:12:57.755 --> 01:13:01.255
- I know it just wasn't the same with him.

01:13:03.508 --> 01:13:06.591
When we were together, it was like...

01:13:08.199 --> 01:13:12.620
He was over there and I was
still thinking about you

01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:14.287
when I was with him.

01:13:20.365 --> 01:13:22.670
But I know what I want now.

01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:24.087
- [Seb] Which is?

01:13:25.639 --> 01:13:26.472
- Us.

01:13:28.969 --> 01:13:32.802
- There's no us, not for
364 days of the year.

01:13:35.372 --> 01:13:37.955
- What if we could change that?

01:13:44.506 --> 01:13:47.923
(beats softly pulsating)

01:14:14.853 --> 01:14:16.181
- How'd you go?

01:14:16.181 --> 01:14:20.196
- As far as I can see,
we have two options.

01:14:20.196 --> 01:14:21.696
One, we do nothing

01:14:23.268 --> 01:14:28.009
and hope that the pebbles
stop skipping eventually.

01:14:28.009 --> 01:14:31.676
Two, we bombard you
with a type of particle,

01:14:33.546 --> 01:14:35.546
try and anchor you down.

01:14:36.505 --> 01:14:38.500
But you have to understand,

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.307
there's no guarantee.

01:14:40.307 --> 01:14:43.890
You could keep skipping
even further ahead.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:51.993
- Seb?

01:15:12.851 --> 01:15:15.071
Have you been here all night?

01:15:15.071 --> 01:15:15.904
- Hm?

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.497
Have you tried this?

01:15:28.497 --> 01:15:29.699
- What, what are you doing?
- It's so good.

01:15:29.699 --> 01:15:30.532
- I'm getting it.

01:15:30.532 --> 01:15:31.365
- What do you mean you're getting it?

01:15:31.365 --> 01:15:32.198
We've got heaps at home.

01:15:32.198 --> 01:15:33.031
- No, we don't have sweet.

01:15:33.031 --> 01:15:34.374
- They're all the same, Seb.

01:15:34.374 --> 01:15:35.579
Can you put it back, please?

01:15:35.579 --> 01:15:36.412
- It's $5.

01:15:36.412 --> 01:15:37.579
- Yeah, my $5.

01:15:40.289 --> 01:15:41.122
- Right.

01:15:49.609 --> 01:15:52.395
- Hey, you're not dressed.

01:15:52.395 --> 01:15:55.548
- You go, I mean, you haven't
seen your friends for ages.

01:15:55.548 --> 01:15:58.127
- [Nina] So you're bailing.

01:15:58.127 --> 01:16:01.460
Seb, you do this every time, it's weird.

01:16:03.246 --> 01:16:05.913
- Why do you even want me there?

01:16:15.031 --> 01:16:16.761
- Was it last weekend
or the weekend before?

01:16:16.761 --> 01:16:17.594
- Weekend before.

01:16:17.594 --> 01:16:18.427
- Weekend before.
- Yeah.

01:16:18.427 --> 01:16:21.104
- And it was so bad, like one
of the bridesmaids hooked up

01:16:21.104 --> 01:16:24.205
with the groomsman before they
even walked down the aisle,

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:25.455
in the rectory.

01:16:27.565 --> 01:16:30.214
I have to be up at six tomorrow.

01:16:30.214 --> 01:16:31.047
- Ouch.

01:16:34.612 --> 01:16:37.546
Telling me to turn off the light?

01:16:37.546 --> 01:16:38.379
- Yeah.

01:16:39.582 --> 01:16:41.665
- Can I just finish this?

01:16:43.204 --> 01:16:44.037
- Fine.

01:16:46.088 --> 01:16:48.009
Finish your book.

01:16:48.009 --> 01:16:49.009
- Thank you.

01:16:52.081 --> 01:16:55.164
- All right, I've got to get to work.

01:16:57.845 --> 01:17:00.735
Can you tidy up by the
time I get back, please?

01:17:00.735 --> 01:17:01.568
Seriously.

01:17:04.306 --> 01:17:05.760
- Yes, Mum.

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.848
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:17:07.848 --> 01:17:10.711
- No, I asked her, I'm a gentleman.

01:17:10.711 --> 01:17:14.878
It's very traditional,
very romantic, it was good.

01:17:16.383 --> 01:17:19.258
- Well, congratulations,
that's really, that's great.

01:17:19.258 --> 01:17:20.984
- Thank you.

01:17:20.984 --> 01:17:25.930
Heard you and Seb were
back together, that's good.

01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:28.264
Just like he's never been away, or?

01:17:28.264 --> 01:17:29.097
- Well...

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.020
- Sorry, it's none of my business,

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:32.853
I shouldn't have asked that.

01:17:32.853 --> 01:17:36.069
- No, no, it's good, it's
just a bit different.

01:17:36.069 --> 01:17:37.123
- Right.

01:17:37.123 --> 01:17:39.728
- Than doing the whole
long-distance thing.

01:17:39.728 --> 01:17:42.676
- Yeah, that would be hard.

01:17:42.676 --> 01:17:46.010
Feel like I dodged a bullet there.

01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:46.843
- Really?

01:17:49.317 --> 01:17:51.567
- Why did you wanna see me?

01:17:57.158 --> 01:17:59.241
- I don't know, I just...

01:18:02.646 --> 01:18:04.306
- No, it's great that things are good

01:18:04.306 --> 01:18:07.771
with you and Seb, though,
that's awesome, patch things up.

01:18:07.771 --> 01:18:10.247
Seems like it's going well,
that's what you wanted, yeah?

01:18:10.247 --> 01:18:11.716
- Yeah.

01:18:11.716 --> 01:18:12.549
Yeah.

01:18:13.745 --> 01:18:14.925
- [Jake] You wouldn't want
to spend years waiting

01:18:14.925 --> 01:18:16.675
for the wrong person.

01:18:28.853 --> 01:18:32.603
(soft acoustic guitar music)
