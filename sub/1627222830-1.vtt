00:42.750 --> 00:45.666
Hello, I am Julius Caesar,
leader of Rome.

00:45.875 --> 00:48.583
Thanks to my strategic prowess,
I've won wars.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.500
I'm so full of myself.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.958
And one day, Julius Caesar met...

00:54.583 --> 00:57.291
Yes, it's me, Diana,
I'm one cool chick.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.500
I'm so pretty, smart and perfect.

00:59.708 --> 01:02.750
Caesar fell in love with Diana
cos she's awesome, obviously.

01:02.916 --> 01:05.125
She fell in love with him cos...
who knows?

01:05.333 --> 01:07.333
And they ended up...

01:08.875 --> 01:09.833
You get it...

01:10.458 --> 01:12.541
The thing grown-ups do when they...

01:12.750 --> 01:15.875
So, Diana got pregnant
and they had a kid. And he got sick.

01:16.083 --> 01:19.583
Caesar got the disease.
And he became sterile.

01:19.791 --> 01:22.000
That'll teach him.
Caesar resented the kid

01:22.208 --> 01:25.458
and wasn't very nice to him.
But the kid grew up, and all was well.

01:25.666 --> 01:28.000
He had a pretty sweet life
and was very happy.

01:28.166 --> 01:30.125
- Is that you?
- Well, yeah.

01:30.333 --> 01:31.708
He's muscly and you're not.

01:31.916 --> 01:33.583
I'm not muscly?

01:33.750 --> 01:37.125
You should take a closer look,
little guy, cos it's kinda obvious.

01:37.291 --> 01:40.083
- So, why do you live here?
- Cos it's nice.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.750
There are no neighbours, it's comfy.

01:42.958 --> 01:44.041
I love it.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.083
- Not saying hi to your dad?
- I can't.

01:52.291 --> 01:53.583
I'm off to a jam-pot party.

01:54.083 --> 01:56.625
So, I'm gonna stay behind
and get ready and...

02:39.458 --> 02:41.458
The return of Julius Caesar.

02:51.708 --> 02:53.458
And he has a gift for Rome.

03:09.208 --> 03:10.166
On your knees.

03:13.708 --> 03:14.791
On your knees!

03:16.583 --> 03:17.833
No.

03:19.916 --> 03:21.041
On your knees.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.416
I,

03:31.583 --> 03:33.166
Julius Caesar,

03:33.875 --> 03:38.041
declare the official capture of
Vercingetorix,

03:38.250 --> 03:40.000
the black bull,

03:40.166 --> 03:43.833
the man who tried to
unite the Gauls against me.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.166
And he got royally screwed over.

03:50.083 --> 03:52.708
The Gauls are more divided than ever

03:52.875 --> 03:56.625
and my legionaries
will be done with them in a few days.

03:56.791 --> 03:59.833
- We're untouchable!
- Excuse me, Caesar, a question.

04:00.041 --> 04:03.000
Oh, Gaius, you know
I don't like it when people cut me off.

04:03.208 --> 04:06.583
Technically, we're not untouchable,
we have to guard our borders.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.208
And, technically,
I'll have to make you shut up.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.583
It's a shame, you're a good comrade.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.625
No, but...

04:19.833 --> 04:22.125
- To the dungeon.
- I wasn't criticising...

04:22.333 --> 04:24.750
I was trying to help. Caesar!

04:24.958 --> 04:26.583
I didn't say anything. Caesar?

04:26.750 --> 04:28.791
OK, now, hold on, guys.

04:28.958 --> 04:31.583
I'm not exactly asking for much, am I?

04:31.750 --> 04:33.708
Just do as I say

04:33.875 --> 04:36.958
and don't interrupt me.
It's really not that hard.

04:42.750 --> 04:43.833
But...

04:44.000 --> 04:45.208
No, I...

04:49.000 --> 04:50.583
I thought you were done talking.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.000
I might have added
a little something at the end.

04:55.041 --> 04:57.083
It's an allergy,
it's not contagious.

04:57.291 --> 04:59.375
- It's the pollen.
- OK, off you go. Bye.

04:59.583 --> 05:00.708
It happens every year...

05:00.875 --> 05:02.833
We'll talk this evening.

05:03.333 --> 05:06.833
Hello. I'm Brutus.

05:07.333 --> 05:08.750
That's crap.

05:09.500 --> 05:13.333
Hi, pleased to meet you.

05:15.958 --> 05:17.583
What about you?
What do you do?

05:17.750 --> 05:19.375
That's fucking lame.

05:29.041 --> 05:30.833
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.416
Is this the jam-pot party?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.416
- Huh?
- Rufus invited me to a jam-pot party.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.333
Plot. A plan-a-plot party.

05:38.541 --> 05:40.625
No, I'm pretty sure he said "jam pot".

05:41.333 --> 05:44.083
- Not possible.
- I know what I heard.

05:44.291 --> 05:45.916
What else did he say?

05:46.083 --> 05:48.041
That it was a secret.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.458
That it was forbidden.

05:50.666 --> 05:52.333
That it was dangerous.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.583
And to bring a spoon.

05:55.166 --> 05:57.208
- He didn't say that.
- No, he didn't.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.916
Gather round, thank you.

06:13.083 --> 06:15.791
To start, Rufus and myself

06:16.750 --> 06:18.875
would like to thank you for coming.

06:19.083 --> 06:21.916
We're growing in numbers
and think it's time to act.

06:22.083 --> 06:23.083
Quickly.

06:25.083 --> 06:27.708
This can't go on, my friends.

06:27.916 --> 06:28.958
Friends?

06:29.166 --> 06:32.333
- Did he say friends? Are we all friends?
- The future is dark.

06:33.583 --> 06:35.416
He's no longer a guide, he's a tyrant.

06:37.708 --> 06:39.000
Yes, yes, yes.

06:39.208 --> 06:42.125
No one feels safe. True or false?

06:42.333 --> 06:43.416
True, true.

06:43.625 --> 06:45.416
Yes, that's true.

06:50.958 --> 06:54.500
So, are we going to
continue like this? No.

06:54.708 --> 06:55.750
No.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.333
- I don't feel like it.
- Of course, you'll say:

07:01.958 --> 07:06.541
"He has the world's largest army",
but there is one spot

07:06.750 --> 07:08.958
- where he's vulnerable.
- His carotid.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.375
We've all got a weak spot there.
So...

07:13.875 --> 07:16.208
- He must have it too.
- No.

07:16.666 --> 07:18.333
- No?
- No, it's the Senate.

07:18.541 --> 07:21.583
We're not allowed to enter the Senate
with weapons, so...

07:21.750 --> 07:23.916
he's vulnerable in the Senate.

07:24.458 --> 07:26.083
More than his carotid?

07:27.750 --> 07:29.000
- Rufus?
- Yes?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.208
Can we talk?

07:31.750 --> 07:34.291
This is ridiculous.
Where did you find him?

07:34.458 --> 07:36.625
It's Brutus, Caesar's son.

07:36.791 --> 07:38.416
You've lost it.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.416
I said that Brutus was Caesar's son

07:40.583 --> 07:42.916
not that Caesar was Brutus's father.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.958
Who is Caesar to you?

07:47.500 --> 07:48.666
He's my dad.

07:48.833 --> 07:51.083
But when Caesar calls you, does he...

07:51.875 --> 07:53.041
call you his son?

07:53.250 --> 07:55.166
No, he calls me "that one".

07:55.333 --> 07:57.833
Where's that one?
What does that one want?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.458
That's why you want him dead.

08:01.666 --> 08:03.708
Huh? Not at all.

08:05.458 --> 08:08.291
Hold on, why are you here, then?

08:08.458 --> 08:11.791
Wait, you guys want to kill Caesar?

08:13.083 --> 08:14.416
It's a plan-a-plot party.

08:14.625 --> 08:15.708
You said jam pot.

08:15.916 --> 08:17.583
No, I never said jam pot.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.125
I remember it well,
I have great hearing.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.000
I said jam-a-plot!

08:22.166 --> 08:24.541
Well, you should enunciate...

08:24.750 --> 08:26.833
Besides, who does jam-pot parties?

08:27.041 --> 08:30.500
People do fondue parties,
pancake parties, why not jam-pot ones?

08:33.791 --> 08:35.832
Look, I want to be friends with you

08:36.000 --> 08:38.166
because I really liked
the vibes in there.

08:38.375 --> 08:41.291
Very feng shui and unifying.
But I don't want to kill Caesar.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.916
You've left us with no choice.

08:56.958 --> 08:59.666
- We've made a decision.
- This is ridiculous.

08:59.833 --> 09:01.750
He knows too much. Let's just kill him.

09:01.916 --> 09:05.291
Think about it, Cassius,
think of the symbolism.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.458
- I don't care about that.
- No, you do care.

09:07.666 --> 09:09.416
You want the people to support us.

09:09.583 --> 09:13.000
And if his own son strikes first,
it'll have more of an impact.

09:13.208 --> 09:14.666
We should be the first to do it.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.000
The first to do it will be killed.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.833
Symbolism is indeed important.

09:20.041 --> 09:22.791
He has no family, no friends,
no one will miss him.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.458
He's the ideal martyr.

09:25.041 --> 09:26.750
All those in favour?

09:29.916 --> 09:33.333
Do you understand? We can't
run the risk of you warning him.

09:33.541 --> 09:36.166
We'll release you
once we've killed Caesar.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.166
He's the enemy, not you.

09:38.333 --> 09:40.791
Wasn't he supposed to kill him with us?

09:42.500 --> 09:44.291
Cassius, do you remember

09:44.458 --> 09:46.750
the first time we saw Caesar?

09:46.916 --> 09:49.583
When he came to the Senate?

09:49.750 --> 09:50.791
He was so brave!

09:51.000 --> 09:54.416
He looked the Senate
straight in the eye and said,

09:54.625 --> 09:57.333
"Every Roman is part of Rome.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.958
When you kill a Roman,
you hurt Rome."

10:03.333 --> 10:06.750
He's really changed,
he's become a monster.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.333
We're doing this for the people.

10:10.458 --> 10:13.333
That's why you'll have to help us,
Brutus.

10:16.791 --> 10:17.958
Brutus?

10:18.583 --> 10:19.833
Come on, Brutus.

10:20.958 --> 10:22.000
Come back.

10:22.166 --> 10:24.333
Reveal yourself, we were just joking.

10:37.916 --> 10:39.208
We can't find him.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.166
We're dead.

10:41.916 --> 10:44.333
- If he tells him...
- We have no choice.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.875
Caesar must be killed today.

10:49.958 --> 10:52.166
You need to start doing things yourself

10:52.333 --> 10:55.416
rather than always running to
the great Caesar.

10:55.625 --> 10:56.625
OK?

10:56.791 --> 11:01.208
Do I, Julius Caesar, come to you
when I'm hungry or thirsty?

11:01.416 --> 11:04.416
No. Because I'm self-sufficient. OK?

11:04.625 --> 11:07.291
You're going to have to
figure it out for yourself.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.666
- OK, next.
- Caesar, I have to talk to you.

11:12.833 --> 11:14.833
- What did you call me?
- Caesar?

11:15.583 --> 11:18.000
And what should you call me?

11:18.166 --> 11:19.500
- Dad?
- Emperor!

11:19.708 --> 11:21.500
- Emperor?
- Dad...

11:21.708 --> 11:23.541
- You said "dad".
- No, I didn't.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.583
He said "dad", didn't he?

11:25.791 --> 11:28.208
- I said "Emperor".
- Enough already.

11:28.416 --> 11:30.708
Impregnating your mum
doesn't make me your dad.

11:30.875 --> 11:31.875
Right, Antonia?

11:35.750 --> 11:37.916
Hey! Why are you doing it so hard?

11:38.125 --> 11:39.625
You want me to get a cold?

11:39.833 --> 11:43.000
- Sorry, I was just trying to...
- Hold on.

11:43.166 --> 11:45.041
- You want me to fall ill, right?
- No.

11:45.250 --> 11:46.916
Yes, that's it.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.375
- You want to kill me!
- No!

11:51.208 --> 11:54.000
Unbelievable.
After everything I've done for you.

11:54.166 --> 11:56.333
I fed you, housed you.

11:56.541 --> 11:59.291
I treated you like my own daughter.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.458
- What's your name?
- Albana.

12:01.666 --> 12:04.166
- If I see you one more time...
- Caesar?

12:04.333 --> 12:06.125
What are you doing?

12:06.333 --> 12:08.625
You signalled that
you wanted a fruit plate.

12:08.833 --> 12:11.041
You're the dumbest one here.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.333
This is madness.

12:12.541 --> 12:14.291
This is the sign for fruit. Not this.

12:14.458 --> 12:16.291
How could you confuse the two?

12:16.458 --> 12:19.000
That's it, you win. Guard!

12:20.041 --> 12:21.166
Unbelievable.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.541
- Go on, piss off.
- But...

12:24.750 --> 12:27.916
Take them to the dungeon.
We'll kill them tomorrow.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.458
They're part of Rome.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.333
I'm Rome.

12:31.791 --> 12:33.750
What did you want to tell me?

12:34.458 --> 12:36.958
- Nothing.
- Then, clear off, out of my sight.

12:40.291 --> 12:41.166
Next.

12:55.166 --> 12:56.208
I'm in.

12:58.833 --> 13:02.166
Excuse me, I'm here.
I've come back.

13:02.375 --> 13:03.958
You say you will, but you won't.

13:04.916 --> 13:07.333
Excuse me. Excuse me, I...

13:09.083 --> 13:11.041
I'm on your side. I'm in.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.541
You made the right choice, Brutus.

13:17.208 --> 13:18.791
Aren't the others here?

13:19.875 --> 13:22.166
No, because they're...

13:22.333 --> 13:24.916
- They're busy.
- They have to wash their hair.

13:25.083 --> 13:26.541
School's out.

13:27.916 --> 13:29.375
Did they chicken out?

13:30.750 --> 13:31.625
Yes.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.833
We'll do it at the start of the session,
it's busier.

13:36.041 --> 13:38.416
You'll have the honour
of striking first.

13:38.625 --> 13:41.041
You'll show up out of nowhere
and stab him.

14:06.583 --> 14:08.375
Can I shout something?

14:08.583 --> 14:10.791
When I stab him,
can I shout something out?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.166
Something that'll go down in history,
like:

14:13.791 --> 14:16.041
"Freedom!" and then I'll...

14:16.250 --> 14:18.000
No, don't shout out anything.

14:18.166 --> 14:20.708
This is a team effort,
not a one-man mission, OK?

14:21.791 --> 14:23.500
Just show up and stab him.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.166
Brutus.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.375
I'm sorry.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.583
You saved Rome.

14:48.333 --> 14:49.583
My son.

14:52.916 --> 14:54.041
Fine by me.

14:54.750 --> 14:55.750
Cassius?

14:56.375 --> 14:57.625
You saved Rome.

15:02.041 --> 15:03.208
Fine by me.

15:03.416 --> 15:05.666
Right, is everyone clear?

15:06.458 --> 15:08.375
How about shouting a little something?

15:08.583 --> 15:11.416
Enough already, stop pushing it.

15:11.583 --> 15:14.875
Friends, let's go make history.

15:33.750 --> 15:34.583
Freed...

15:43.541 --> 15:46.291
This is a misunderstanding.
I was just making a snack,

15:46.458 --> 15:48.375
- there's no need to...
- Shut up!

15:51.000 --> 15:52.166
I was just...

16:11.166 --> 16:13.083
I treated you like my own son.

16:14.458 --> 16:17.291
Actually, no,
you've never treated me like your son.

16:17.458 --> 16:19.250
Which is weird since I am your son.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.125
We're still waiting on the tests.

16:21.333 --> 16:22.458
What's my name?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.916
- That one.
- That's the nickname you gave me.

16:26.125 --> 16:29.375
The term of endearment I gave you.

16:31.083 --> 16:32.458
You know nothing about me.

16:32.666 --> 16:35.208
I know that you're a traitor
and that you'll die.

16:36.333 --> 16:39.208
- You're going to kill me?
- No one cared when you were alive,

16:39.375 --> 16:40.541
so, dead...

16:42.583 --> 16:44.458
Farewell, that one.

16:53.166 --> 16:54.041
Leave.

16:55.208 --> 16:56.166
Go away.

16:56.916 --> 16:59.416
I don't want to see you in Rome again.

17:00.291 --> 17:02.250
Don't look back. Get lost.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.625
When will you get that
nobody loves you here?

17:08.790 --> 17:10.583
You're not welcome here.

17:24.333 --> 17:25.750
Are you going to kill me?

17:26.833 --> 17:29.166
It's us, Cassius and Rufus.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.291
No...

17:31.458 --> 17:33.875
I know a Rufus, but he's not a guard.

17:34.041 --> 17:36.416
So...
And I've never heard of a Cassius.

17:37.583 --> 17:39.000
Is he having a laugh?

17:39.166 --> 17:40.750
Right. Brutus, it's us!

17:41.458 --> 17:43.625
Rufus, have you come to help me?

17:43.791 --> 17:45.000
Nice to meet you.

17:47.791 --> 17:49.333
Go to the southern gate.

17:49.541 --> 17:51.083
- One of our men is there.
- Then what?

17:51.291 --> 17:53.500
Start a new life.
There's nothing for you here.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.000
And Caesar?

17:55.208 --> 17:57.625
Since your little fall,
no one can get close to him.

17:57.833 --> 17:59.458
You remind me of someone.

17:59.666 --> 18:02.250
It's me.
Do you recognise me like this?

18:02.916 --> 18:05.250
Brutus, you must leave Rome asap.

18:05.458 --> 18:08.583
But I don't want to leave Rome.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.583
You know what your crazy father
has in store for you?

18:11.750 --> 18:14.583
He wants to sacrifice you tomorrow.
So, it's up to you:

18:14.750 --> 18:16.625
a life yonder or death here.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.666
- Oh, that was good.
- Wow.

18:19.625 --> 18:20.750
That was...

18:21.625 --> 18:23.416
Beautiful. I...
Wow.

18:23.625 --> 18:25.250
That was deep. Powerful.

18:25.458 --> 18:27.416
It just came to me.

18:27.625 --> 18:29.416
- You've used that one before.
- No.

18:30.541 --> 18:32.000
- Flee, you poor fool!
- OK.

18:48.208 --> 18:49.833
- Cassius.
- Rufus.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.166
We're officials.

18:52.333 --> 18:53.375
Thank you.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.708
I know that this isn't your style,

18:56.875 --> 18:59.875
but we can fit up to 2,000 people here.
Can you believe that?

19:00.416 --> 19:01.875
Who are those people?

19:02.708 --> 19:04.291
They're potential buyers.

19:04.500 --> 19:07.375
But if you want, you can can take
half of it for yourselves.

19:07.541 --> 19:09.583
Caesar, whenever you're ready.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.750
I have a surprise for you,
people of Rome.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.583
Bring out the sacrificial lambs.

19:24.791 --> 19:26.541
Die!

19:32.750 --> 19:34.166
Why the hell is he there?

19:39.791 --> 19:42.500
Oh, my people, my dear Rome.

19:43.708 --> 19:45.583
Today, I have for you

19:45.750 --> 19:47.416
the sacrifice of slaves

19:47.583 --> 19:49.708
who have betrayed me, disappointed me,

19:49.875 --> 19:51.958
or betrayed and/or disappointed me.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.416
Today, these attackists...

19:57.041 --> 20:00.083
- Are you not Caesar's son?
- No.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.291
Not at all. Not in the slightest.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.625
- Really?
- No.

20:04.833 --> 20:07.000
- What's your name?
- Brutus... Fructus.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.958
Fructus. Gusbulz.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.833
Feel free to give it a like.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.083
Fructulgluz?

20:12.291 --> 20:15.875
The Z is half Roman and half Turkish.

20:16.083 --> 20:18.708
Nice to meet you, Fructus.
Spartacus.

20:18.916 --> 20:20.958
I will always tend to your comfort,

20:21.166 --> 20:24.291
beauty and your spending power.

20:25.125 --> 20:27.250
At least we'll die together, brother.

20:29.125 --> 20:30.041
Great...

20:30.250 --> 20:31.583
And now...

20:33.416 --> 20:35.791
let the sacrifices begin!

20:45.583 --> 20:48.208
- We're in for it.
- Yeah.

20:53.166 --> 20:54.541
You're standing?

20:55.583 --> 20:57.791
Oh, uh, yeah.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.583
- You've been able to walk all this time?
- It must be a miracle.

21:01.750 --> 21:04.625
A miracle?
I'll show you a fucking miracle!

21:07.458 --> 21:09.208
Run, Fructus, run.

21:09.416 --> 21:10.875
I don't know how to run.

21:11.541 --> 21:13.375
I don't want to trip over.

21:14.791 --> 21:16.708
One man against all of them.

21:16.875 --> 21:17.916
Such bravery.

21:21.333 --> 21:22.666
Go on, go on.

21:22.875 --> 21:24.250
You're inspiring, Fructus.

23:09.125 --> 23:11.166
- So, you survived...
- Get back here!

23:11.375 --> 23:14.000
Stop. I told you to stop!

23:14.208 --> 23:16.958
So, you survived my gladiators.
Bravo.

23:17.541 --> 23:18.833
Right, you!

23:19.000 --> 23:20.083
You're free.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.583
We can't tell who you mean.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.958
You, the strong one.

23:33.125 --> 23:34.166
You're free.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.041
You deserve it, comrade. Bravo.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.791
He was talking to you.

23:42.708 --> 23:43.541
Really?

23:47.708 --> 23:49.125
It was an honour.

23:53.458 --> 23:55.041
You, the girl.

23:55.250 --> 23:56.208
Albana.

23:56.416 --> 23:57.458
You're free.

24:02.708 --> 24:03.750
Thank you.

24:10.750 --> 24:11.791
As for you,

24:12.000 --> 24:13.458
oh great warrior,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.375
who survived
without even lifting a finger...

24:18.208 --> 24:21.125
who injected his strength
and passion into others,

24:21.333 --> 24:23.458
- I'd like to let you leave, but...
- Yes?

24:23.666 --> 24:26.958
Wouldn't you rather have that man
defending the empire?

24:28.750 --> 24:30.875
- No...
- Flooring our enemies?

24:31.083 --> 24:32.958
And becoming our hero?

24:33.875 --> 24:36.291
Nope, not even a little bit.

24:36.458 --> 24:40.541
Put your arms down.
We want freedom like the others.

24:40.750 --> 24:42.083
We'd rather have that.

24:42.250 --> 24:43.791
With great power

24:44.291 --> 24:45.958
comes great responsibility.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.333
I've decided to send you

24:48.541 --> 24:51.458
to a place where your bravery
will be most needed.

24:53.541 --> 24:54.541
To Gaul.

24:55.250 --> 24:58.166
Help our army beat those savage Gauls.

24:58.375 --> 25:00.208
Caesar, please, not Gaul.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.583
A few years ago,

25:08.750 --> 25:10.583
I was captured in a battle.

25:10.750 --> 25:13.166
- What about you?
- Me?

25:13.333 --> 25:16.583
I was born a slave
like my parents, my grandparents,

25:16.750 --> 25:19.750
my uncles, my aunts, my nephews.
Well, everyone.

25:20.708 --> 25:23.083
Right, well, safe trip.

25:23.291 --> 25:25.458
Sorry, that's not really my thing.

25:25.666 --> 25:27.958
I'm not the touchy-feely kind.

25:28.166 --> 25:30.375
- No offence.
- I'm not either, just as well.

25:30.541 --> 25:32.291
- Take care.
- Ciao.

25:32.458 --> 25:35.000
What are you going to do
now that you're free?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.208
Go home.

25:37.875 --> 25:39.125
I have a debt to settle.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.250
That's good, a debt to settle.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.666
I have no debts.

25:46.375 --> 25:47.625
What am I gonna do now?

25:47.833 --> 25:51.416
As a slave, you have no soul,
so you can't understand what I'm saying.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.833
- I do understand.
- No. You think you can,

25:54.041 --> 25:55.291
but your brain can't.

25:55.458 --> 25:57.875
- I understood the whole thing.
- No, no.

25:58.750 --> 25:59.833
Why?

26:00.000 --> 26:01.958
Because your brain can't digest it

26:02.125 --> 26:03.958
because of your slave molecules.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.500
Says who?

26:05.708 --> 26:08.250
Enough.
If I say you can't, you can't.

26:09.541 --> 26:11.500
Now, don't hang about, slave.

26:14.333 --> 26:15.708
Are you happy with him?

26:15.875 --> 26:18.125
Ecstatic.
As you can see, he's a real hoot.

26:19.125 --> 26:20.125
OK.

26:21.875 --> 26:24.250
Oh, come on, of course I'm miserable.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.375
Have you ever seen a happy slave?

26:26.541 --> 26:28.000
What a complete idiot.

26:28.166 --> 26:29.833
- Who? Are you talking to me?
- No.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.333
- What would Fructus do?
- Let's go.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.958
What do you want? Go on, move.

26:44.791 --> 26:46.458
See? He doesn't understand.

26:47.125 --> 26:48.708
He has no soul.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.375
See? He doesn't.

26:53.125 --> 26:57.666
We can't go through at the same time.
You have to step aside.

26:58.916 --> 27:00.083
Free her.

27:02.541 --> 27:04.333
- Free her?
- Free her?

27:06.166 --> 27:08.541
I think he wants you
to free up the space.

27:08.750 --> 27:09.875
No, no.

27:10.875 --> 27:13.208
Her. Free her.

27:13.416 --> 27:15.583
- Can that be done?
- No, it can't.

27:17.875 --> 27:21.625
Stop. Let me go, let me go.
That hurts!

27:21.833 --> 27:24.958
- What?
- Tell him to let me go.

27:25.125 --> 27:28.208
I don't understand what you're saying.

27:28.416 --> 27:32.208
I have no soul
so I can't grasp words.

27:32.416 --> 27:33.750
Dear, oh, dear.

27:33.916 --> 27:35.250
Fine, I'll free her.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.958
- Albana!
- That kind of hurt.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.916
I know what I'm going to do now!

28:13.625 --> 28:15.250
Here. Another round.

28:42.791 --> 28:44.125
Here, clean this.

29:19.500 --> 29:20.958
Don't be angry at them.

29:22.125 --> 29:23.875
They're just frustrated.

29:24.833 --> 29:27.958
They've been here for a long time.
They like to heckle the newbies.

29:30.583 --> 29:32.541
It's so violent out there.

29:33.416 --> 29:35.791
So, we end up being like that in here.

29:38.125 --> 29:40.541
The worst thing
is not seeing your family.

29:42.875 --> 29:43.958
Don't you miss yours?

29:44.875 --> 29:46.166
I don't have a family.

29:47.208 --> 29:49.833
We all have one,
that's the reason we're here.

29:51.541 --> 29:52.875
To defend them.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.375
So those barbarians don't invade us.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.833
Aren't we the ones invading them?

29:58.750 --> 30:00.583
So that those barbarians
don't invade us.

30:02.375 --> 30:04.916
So, you really don't have a family?

30:05.916 --> 30:07.041
Yes, one person.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.166
- Did you live together?
- No.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.250
But we were very close.

30:15.125 --> 30:17.250
Know that you've got two people now.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.333
You and I, we're brothers, OK?

30:20.166 --> 30:21.208
Brothers?

30:21.375 --> 30:23.708
Tell the others that
if they still tease you.

30:24.125 --> 30:26.583
- Fall in!
- Hold on, brother, as in...

30:26.750 --> 30:29.833
As in brothers?
Wait up, brother!

30:30.541 --> 30:34.375
- You mean like real brothers?
- Yes.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.166
Because a brother is more than a friend.

30:38.500 --> 30:41.083
- A brother is for life.
- For life.

30:41.250 --> 30:42.125
OK.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.875
I've just found out that
a Gallic village was going to attack us.

30:47.083 --> 30:50.250
So, you're going to go
and attack them first. OK?

30:50.458 --> 30:51.916
Yes! Which village?

30:53.458 --> 30:55.958
Uh, well, one of those villages.

30:56.875 --> 30:58.875
It's not that complicated, leave,

30:59.083 --> 31:01.708
go in any direction,
and when you see a village,

31:01.875 --> 31:03.166
then that's the one.

31:03.375 --> 31:05.250
When are they planning to attack us?

31:07.875 --> 31:08.833
Soon.

31:09.333 --> 31:12.583
I dunno.
Between 10 am... 2 pm...

31:12.750 --> 31:14.750
Definitely before snack time.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.750
- We should get going, then.
- Yeah. Go on.

31:22.708 --> 31:26.166
See you tomorrow, guys.
We'll be with you.

31:26.333 --> 31:28.250
Yeah, go on, guys.

31:32.125 --> 31:33.541
They're fucked.

31:33.708 --> 31:35.958
What do you mean they're fucked?

31:36.125 --> 31:38.250
Don't worry, they know.

31:38.416 --> 31:40.083
We all pretend.

31:40.250 --> 31:43.708
That way it doesn't
bring down the morale around here.

31:43.875 --> 31:45.875
No, they're coming back.

31:46.041 --> 31:47.333
Of course they are.

31:47.750 --> 31:48.750
What?

31:51.125 --> 31:53.833
Can you believe it?
A brand new toga!

31:54.000 --> 31:55.708
He mixed up white and red.

31:55.875 --> 31:58.958
He's ten. That's old enough to know
what white and red is.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.583
- Of course. What did you do?
- Gave him ten lashes.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.708
No, with the toga?

32:03.875 --> 32:05.666
- I threw it away.
- How annoying.

32:05.875 --> 32:07.750
Caesar sees me
as one of his brothers.

32:07.916 --> 32:09.166
That's Vercingetorix.

32:09.375 --> 32:11.875
- You're the Gallic chieftain.
- No, I'm not.

32:12.083 --> 32:13.750
Yes. I recognise you.

32:13.958 --> 32:15.833
No, I'm not. Ladies...

32:16.000 --> 32:19.166
Go get something to eat.
I'll meet you inside. Bye.

32:20.750 --> 32:23.583
- What exactly do you want?
- An explanation.

32:25.750 --> 32:27.875
Fine, if I tell you, will you drop it?

32:30.625 --> 32:32.291
Caesar never actually beat me.

32:34.750 --> 32:37.708
Gaul is divided, if we joined forces
we'd be too dangerous.

32:37.875 --> 32:40.958
Caesar knows that. He purposely lost
some battles against me.

32:41.125 --> 32:44.416
Suddenly, I became the hero
and that's when he "captured" me.

32:45.875 --> 32:47.625
Why did you agree to that?

32:47.833 --> 32:50.208
Have you seen the women
around here?

32:51.208 --> 32:54.125
I'm in Rome, I'm in a palace,
I've got money.

32:54.333 --> 32:55.583
I mean, come on.

32:55.791 --> 32:57.708
OK, bye. Oh, by the way...

32:57.875 --> 33:01.708
Vercingetorix is dead.
It's Versus now, OK?

33:03.500 --> 33:05.625
Coming, ladies. Coming.

33:11.208 --> 33:12.750
Open the gate!

33:31.916 --> 33:33.791
Claudius, what's the lowdown?

33:35.750 --> 33:37.208
There were many more of us.

33:38.541 --> 33:40.125
As usual.

33:40.708 --> 33:41.791
And they beat us.

33:42.750 --> 33:43.708
As usual.

33:43.916 --> 33:45.875
We tried, but...

33:47.500 --> 33:49.250
How many did you kill?

33:53.333 --> 33:54.708
We injured two.

33:56.875 --> 33:58.375
I would've liked to do more.

34:00.708 --> 34:05.375
The quicker we beat these villages,
the quicker we can go home, guys.

34:05.541 --> 34:07.166
Bear that in mind.

34:08.625 --> 34:11.000
Go see the medic.

34:15.541 --> 34:18.750
Rest up, you'll be fine.
Brutus, compresses.

34:19.666 --> 34:21.708
Honestly,
I didn't think you'd come back.

34:21.916 --> 34:25.416
- I get it. Nobody did.
- Someone did.

34:25.625 --> 34:26.666
He did.

34:28.750 --> 34:29.833
Well, he's my bro.

34:31.458 --> 34:32.583
Right.

34:33.875 --> 34:35.666
Excuse me, what are you doing?

34:36.166 --> 34:39.250
I'm cutting off his arm.
If it gets infected, he could die.

34:39.416 --> 34:40.875
Relax, I'm ambidextrous.

34:41.083 --> 34:43.666
All you need are some eucalyptus leaves
to soothe it.

34:47.041 --> 34:48.416
I know a bit about botany.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.583
- It isn't too tight, is it?
- No.

34:52.750 --> 34:55.666
Leave it be now
and it should be better in a few days.

34:56.625 --> 34:58.125
It'll heal itself.

34:58.291 --> 35:00.458
We should talk to Centurion Decimus.

35:00.625 --> 35:02.708
He should transfer you to the infirmary.

35:02.875 --> 35:06.125
- Don't you think that's shameful?
- That you saved my arm? Sure it is.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.208
My dad was ashamed
that I couldn't fight

35:09.375 --> 35:11.291
and that I preferred wood and plants.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.541
Your dad's clueless.

35:12.708 --> 35:16.041
If he were a soldier, he'd know that
your insight is invaluable.

35:16.208 --> 35:17.708
He is a soldier.

35:17.875 --> 35:20.375
He's a rookie, then.
A chief would know that.

35:21.166 --> 35:22.125
He is a chief.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.250
What kind of chief?

35:25.458 --> 35:27.875
- A chief-chief.
- Higher than a centurion?

35:30.583 --> 35:32.666
- Like?
- Like Caesar.

35:34.541 --> 35:36.833
Don't tell anyone.
I don't want them to hate me.

35:39.875 --> 35:41.250
You can trust me.

35:44.333 --> 35:46.625
No, Brutus, not like that.
Let me do it.

35:46.833 --> 35:47.833
- What?
- Let me do it.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
- But it's my turn.
- No, it's mine.

35:51.708 --> 35:53.625
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

35:56.708 --> 35:58.041
Let me do that, Brutus.

36:10.416 --> 36:12.125
Enjoy, Brutus.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.708
Is that for me? Really?

36:17.333 --> 36:18.416
Want some?

36:18.625 --> 36:20.583
- No.
- Take some.

36:20.750 --> 36:22.458
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

36:22.625 --> 36:24.708
- Medicus?
- Yes, please.

36:26.125 --> 36:27.166
Go!

36:28.041 --> 36:30.083
Go on, Brutus!

36:39.375 --> 36:40.750
Foul!

36:40.958 --> 36:42.166
No, he's playing ball.

36:42.375 --> 36:43.416
Go on, get up.

36:44.666 --> 36:46.125
There we go.
Go on, Brutus.

36:47.750 --> 36:50.208
Foul, foul!

36:50.416 --> 36:51.500
- Really?
- Yes.

36:51.708 --> 36:52.666
Foul.

37:00.791 --> 37:02.166
- Blah blah.
- Blah blah.

37:03.083 --> 37:04.458
- Blah blah.
- Blah.

37:05.083 --> 37:06.208
Penalty.

37:08.041 --> 37:09.833
Are you sure I should take the shot?

37:14.333 --> 37:15.708
So close!

37:17.208 --> 37:18.666
- I wasn't far off.
- No...

37:26.666 --> 37:28.250
Go, Brutus!

37:30.708 --> 37:32.333
Come on, Brutus.

37:38.625 --> 37:40.500
Now, that's what I call skill!

37:48.708 --> 37:51.875
- My dear Brutus, are you good?
- Yes, thanks, Centurion.

37:52.875 --> 37:56.500
And thanks to everyone
because everyone's so nice to me.

37:56.666 --> 37:59.541
- I wasn't expecting that.
- Of course we are.

37:59.708 --> 38:01.416
Because we're a...?

38:01.583 --> 38:02.666
Garrison?

38:03.083 --> 38:05.333
A family.

38:05.500 --> 38:09.666
Let your dad know that
we're taking good care of you.

38:09.833 --> 38:11.750
Get him to send us backup.

38:11.916 --> 38:14.166
That won't be easy, he hates me.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.166
- Sorry?
- He hates me.

38:16.333 --> 38:18.166
Because I tried to kill him.

38:18.333 --> 38:20.083
That's why he sent me here.

38:22.083 --> 38:23.625
What, is there a problem?

38:24.500 --> 38:26.041
You took advantage of us.

38:26.208 --> 38:29.250
Not at all! I thought
you were just naturally kind.

38:29.458 --> 38:31.375
A naturally kind Roman army?

38:31.541 --> 38:33.083
You tried to kill Caesar!

38:33.291 --> 38:35.583
If you put it like that...
But there's more to it.

38:35.750 --> 38:38.208
It made me realise that
killing isn't my thing.

38:38.416 --> 38:40.916
We kept you at the camp
and away from the Gauls.

38:41.083 --> 38:42.541
I cut your toenails!

38:42.750 --> 38:43.750
And I thanked you.

38:44.833 --> 38:47.333
Don't worry, Brutus,
we're not mad at you.

38:47.541 --> 38:49.583
- Yes, we are.
- It's bloody sarcasm.

38:50.333 --> 38:53.416
Don't worry, Brutus,
we're not mad at you.

38:53.583 --> 38:56.708
If I'm not mistaken,
you've never done patrolling, have you?

38:56.875 --> 38:57.833
Uh, no.

38:58.333 --> 39:00.083
Well, the time has come!

39:00.250 --> 39:02.083
- He'll get killed.
- Who gives a shit?

39:02.250 --> 39:04.708
- He has no weapons.
- Not my problem.

39:06.833 --> 39:09.416
As payback,
you can keep your sticks!

39:10.625 --> 39:12.333
Go hit yourself with them!

39:15.125 --> 39:16.833
Hey, Brutus?

39:18.458 --> 39:19.750
Good luck.

39:22.333 --> 39:23.458
Guys...

39:41.375 --> 39:42.916
I made a move, it's your turn.

39:46.208 --> 39:47.583
Are you upset?

39:49.666 --> 39:53.208
- Was I a little hard on him?
- You could always pardon him.

39:54.208 --> 39:55.541
They'll think I'm weak.

39:55.750 --> 39:57.083
Or that you're fair.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.583
Bring him back.

40:05.083 --> 40:06.916
What would I do without you?

40:08.625 --> 40:11.083
Oh, there he is, he's back.

40:12.458 --> 40:16.166
Where were you, my little munchkin?
I was a meanie to you.

40:16.375 --> 40:18.666
Because you wee-weed
on your daddy's bed.

40:18.875 --> 40:21.916
But daddy's happy to see you again.

40:22.083 --> 40:23.750
Look at what daddy's playing.

40:23.916 --> 40:26.500
And look at what daddy's going to do.

40:29.875 --> 40:33.666
Checkmate. I won again.

40:33.875 --> 40:35.916
See how good daddy is
when you're around?

40:36.083 --> 40:37.500
High five.

40:52.208 --> 40:54.500
- Was the food the same as usual?
- Mm-hm.

40:55.458 --> 40:58.083
I mean, it wasn't good, as usual.

40:58.250 --> 41:00.208
It wasn't any less good this evening.

41:01.083 --> 41:02.208
Exactly.

41:03.875 --> 41:07.250
- What's this aftertaste?
- Guilt, my friend.

41:11.791 --> 41:14.041
And the dessert was pretty gross too.

41:16.708 --> 41:19.916
- Are you joking?
- It's still his son.

41:20.083 --> 41:22.750
If he ever pardons him,
he would want him to be alive.

41:22.916 --> 41:25.791
- And he'd owe you one.
- He's the one who sent him here.

41:27.083 --> 41:30.083
And there's not much to do here
other than kill or be killed.

41:30.291 --> 41:32.625
I agree with you, Centurion.

41:33.833 --> 41:35.916
Isn't Caesar known for being impulsive?

41:39.458 --> 41:42.333
I wonder who he'd be angry at
if his son were dead?

41:45.166 --> 41:46.875
Come on, get your arses in gear!

41:47.041 --> 41:49.375
Hurry the fuck up.

41:50.083 --> 41:52.291
Find him for me. Look everywhere:

41:52.458 --> 41:55.916
in the trees,
under the bushes, boulders.

41:56.083 --> 41:57.708
What's with your helmet?

41:57.875 --> 42:00.208
Get searching
and find him for me!

42:20.458 --> 42:21.291
Fuck.

42:41.666 --> 42:42.750
Are you Roman?

42:44.083 --> 42:45.000
No.

42:45.208 --> 42:46.666
I hate Romans.

42:47.541 --> 42:48.500
OK.

42:49.083 --> 42:51.208
A good Roman is a dead Roman.

42:52.333 --> 42:54.541
- OK.
- What's your name?

42:54.708 --> 42:56.500
- Brutus.
- Brutus what?

42:56.708 --> 43:00.000
When you introduce yourself,
you give your name and parents' names.

43:00.666 --> 43:03.708
Efna Epona Alorix.

43:03.916 --> 43:05.708
I'm Alorix.

43:05.875 --> 43:08.083
A Roman-killer, it's a family tradition.

43:08.833 --> 43:10.666
And she's my daughter.

43:10.875 --> 43:12.541
Coria Efna Vercingetorix.

43:13.583 --> 43:15.041
Oh, you're the wife of...

43:15.250 --> 43:16.625
Got it now? Your turn.

43:17.875 --> 43:18.875
Brutus...

43:21.500 --> 43:22.500
Diana...

43:24.083 --> 43:25.208
You won't like this.

43:26.958 --> 43:28.208
Go on.

43:29.208 --> 43:30.750
Julius Caesar.

43:34.458 --> 43:38.083
What's Caesar's son doing in Gaul?
Preparing an attack? Scouting?

43:38.291 --> 43:40.791
It's my punishment
for trying to kill him.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.958
- What?
- No way.

43:52.083 --> 43:54.208
OK, I'm done. That's enough.

43:54.750 --> 43:57.041
Is this how you welcome all Romans?

43:57.208 --> 43:59.583
Seriously?
Have you not looked around here?

44:03.833 --> 44:04.750
But I'm not dead.

44:05.333 --> 44:06.333
Not yet!

44:14.750 --> 44:17.000
- What?
- Nothing. We might have the wrong guy.

44:17.666 --> 44:20.333
- What do you mean?
- You know my philosophy:

44:20.500 --> 44:22.708
- A good Roman...?
- Is a dead Roman.

44:22.916 --> 44:25.708
We haven't killed you
cos she's been spreading the word.

44:25.916 --> 44:27.750
- Who's "she"?
- Albana.

44:27.916 --> 44:30.291
- You saved her, right?
- Albana?

44:30.500 --> 44:33.166
- That doesn't seem likely.
- Albana remembers me?

44:33.375 --> 44:35.666
She said she'd drink the blood
of whoever harmed you.

44:38.208 --> 44:39.125
Are you touched?

44:39.333 --> 44:41.666
And disgusted.
That can't be good for the gut.

44:41.833 --> 44:44.750
But that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

44:44.916 --> 44:46.833
Then, tell her that.

44:48.708 --> 44:51.166
- I've missed you so much.
- What's she doing?

44:54.541 --> 44:57.000
- It's good to see you again.
- I saw her two days ago.

45:01.291 --> 45:03.291
- What's got into you?
- This is how we say hi.

45:03.500 --> 45:05.750
Since when? Who approved that?

45:19.625 --> 45:21.750
- All good?
- It's you! Why are you here?

45:21.958 --> 45:23.416
You asked us to keep him here.

45:23.583 --> 45:26.125
Who's hungry? I'm hungry.
You hungry? Let's eat.

45:32.416 --> 45:33.833
- Are you sure?
- Certain.

45:34.041 --> 45:35.208
What a traitor.

45:35.416 --> 45:37.458
And to think I let him save my arm.

45:37.625 --> 45:38.916
I regret it so much now.

45:39.083 --> 45:41.541
We send him to die nobly
and he's with the enemy.

45:41.750 --> 45:43.250
What should we do? Attack?

45:43.916 --> 45:45.541
Definitely not.

45:46.458 --> 45:49.041
That idiot's going to
make us win the war.

46:01.333 --> 46:02.500
Checkmate.

46:03.333 --> 46:05.250
I win again!

46:05.708 --> 46:07.708
You're a force to be reckoned with.

46:07.916 --> 46:09.333
I don't even know the rules.

46:10.625 --> 46:11.666
Ah, Caesar.

46:14.750 --> 46:15.916
What's he doing here?

46:16.125 --> 46:18.041
- Wasn't he supposed to disappear?
- Yes.

46:18.250 --> 46:20.708
- What do you want?
- Just a few quarters.

46:20.916 --> 46:23.541
- He wants to be quartered?
- I think he means money.

46:23.750 --> 46:26.083
I did think that was a strange request.

46:26.291 --> 46:28.583
- Caesar has given you a year's worth.
- Yeah, OK.

46:29.333 --> 46:32.541
You know what it's like.
A charge here, a tax there.

46:32.750 --> 46:34.291
Some withholding tax as well,

46:34.458 --> 46:36.416
those unexpected direct debits.

46:36.625 --> 46:37.916
And then you're skint.

46:38.083 --> 46:40.791
Get out of my sight
if you don't want to be quartered.

46:47.750 --> 46:51.166
I don't know which village
is betraying us, but we must stay alert.

46:51.375 --> 46:52.291
Watch, listen.

46:52.458 --> 46:55.750
As soon as you have any information,
come straight to me.

46:55.958 --> 46:56.791
Is that clear?

46:56.958 --> 46:59.291
My friend and I
cut contact for two years.

46:59.500 --> 47:01.875
You know how we made up?
A jam-pot party.

47:02.708 --> 47:05.375
- You do jam-pot parties here?
- All the time.

47:05.541 --> 47:08.791
I mean, people do fondue parties,
pancake parties,

47:09.000 --> 47:10.375
why not jam-pot parties?

47:10.875 --> 47:12.291
Exactly.

47:14.083 --> 47:16.375
Sorry. Excuse me, please.

47:17.708 --> 47:19.375
I have an important announcement.

47:20.041 --> 47:22.458
I found out that
according to traditional law,

47:22.625 --> 47:25.916
when a Gaul is in danger

47:26.125 --> 47:29.875
and a non-Gaul saves her life,

47:30.083 --> 47:34.291
the Gaul must marry the non-Gaul.

47:35.666 --> 47:38.958
- What law is that?
- Therefore, I have to marry Brutus.

47:40.583 --> 47:42.833
- Enjoy your meal.
- What the hell?

47:43.041 --> 47:45.458
Dad, I hope you didn't vote for
such a primitive law.

47:45.625 --> 47:47.625
- I don't know about it!
- What do you mean?

47:48.333 --> 47:51.791
I don't want you to get into trouble,
you don't have to marry me.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.125
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't. I'm the leader here.

47:55.333 --> 47:57.500
I'm scrapping that misogynistic law.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.708
No! You can't.

47:59.875 --> 48:01.583
Traditions are important.

48:02.916 --> 48:04.791
I've never heard about this one.

48:17.541 --> 48:18.333
Well?

48:20.083 --> 48:23.208
- Do we have to get married?
- What did you say?

48:23.416 --> 48:26.500
- Do we have to get married or not?
- No.

48:26.708 --> 48:30.166
No, you don't have to.
Actually, yes, it is mandatory.

48:31.750 --> 48:33.666
I hadn't read that part.

48:33.875 --> 48:35.333
Oh, poor thing.

48:37.458 --> 48:39.416
And you have to propose soon.

48:39.625 --> 48:42.041
- That's what's written here too.
- Really? When?

48:44.333 --> 48:46.250
Um, within the next month.

48:46.458 --> 48:48.916
Within the next week!

48:49.916 --> 48:50.625
Four days?

48:51.958 --> 48:53.333
It's mandatory.

49:00.458 --> 49:03.333
She doesn't really have a choice.
She'll accept, but...

49:03.916 --> 49:04.875
she has to.

49:09.083 --> 49:10.000
Hold on.

49:10.875 --> 49:13.208
I missed a section.

49:14.250 --> 49:15.916
"When the proposal has been made,

49:16.083 --> 49:19.750
the bride has the right
to accept or decline."

49:19.916 --> 49:21.458
It said the opposite before.

49:21.666 --> 49:24.083
Even if it said the opposite before."

49:24.291 --> 49:27.875
Good. She'll be able to say no, then.

49:29.041 --> 49:30.000
That's good.

49:31.333 --> 49:32.458
But...

49:32.625 --> 49:33.875
Would you...

49:34.708 --> 49:35.916
like her to say yes?

49:37.583 --> 49:38.666
I don't know.

49:41.666 --> 49:43.166
Do you like Albana?

49:44.666 --> 49:45.708
A bit.

49:46.750 --> 49:48.166
What do you like about her?

49:49.333 --> 49:53.208
She's beautiful, kind.
She's brave.

49:54.208 --> 49:55.083
She smells nice.

49:55.833 --> 49:58.916
- What don't you like?
- She likes fighting and drinks blood.

49:59.833 --> 50:01.500
So what?

50:01.708 --> 50:02.625
That's disgusting.

50:02.791 --> 50:05.041
I've noticed hygiene isn't your thing.

50:05.250 --> 50:06.291
Hygi... what?

50:06.500 --> 50:08.291
Exactly. That's the problem.

50:08.458 --> 50:10.583
Do you know what you'll say to her?

50:10.791 --> 50:13.458
When you ask a woman for her hand,
there's a ritual.

50:13.666 --> 50:16.625
What ritual?
I'm not into drinking weird stuff.

50:16.791 --> 50:19.250
No, it's very simple.

50:19.458 --> 50:20.916
You get down on one knee,

50:21.083 --> 50:23.416
tell her what you own, who you are,

50:23.583 --> 50:25.333
and what you plan to do.

50:26.083 --> 50:27.000
No blood?

50:28.666 --> 50:29.666
No blood.

50:33.083 --> 50:36.625
- What the hell are we doing here?
- Brutus must've died in Gaul.

50:36.833 --> 50:38.708
We have to find another symbol.

50:39.458 --> 50:41.166
And Spartacus would be perfect.

50:41.333 --> 50:43.375
Right, you think this is clean.

50:43.541 --> 50:46.250
Now that you're free,
you've got to give it your all.

50:46.458 --> 50:48.625
Yes, it's my bracelet,

50:48.791 --> 50:50.875
but you leave your mark
when you clean it

50:51.041 --> 50:53.041
and then it becomes our bracelet.

50:53.250 --> 50:55.375
So, get back to it. Go on.

51:02.333 --> 51:04.041
You must be Erell.

51:04.208 --> 51:05.333
Hand it over.

51:06.083 --> 51:07.041
Give it here.

51:08.250 --> 51:09.083
Come on.

51:10.083 --> 51:11.916
Does everyone pay to talk to him?

51:12.083 --> 51:15.458
Yes, it's for the cause,
for the group...

51:16.208 --> 51:19.083
The community...
which allows for...

51:19.916 --> 51:21.791
OK, go ahead. He's waiting.

51:31.125 --> 51:34.750
You killed your masters
and fled with their clothes. Smart.

51:34.958 --> 51:36.416
No, not at all.

51:37.250 --> 51:38.208
We're senators.

51:40.208 --> 51:42.375
I think settlers are really cool.

51:44.416 --> 51:46.583
He's even worse than "that one".

51:46.750 --> 51:49.458
No, Spartacus, we're senators.

51:50.500 --> 51:53.500
But we're like you.
We're Caesar's slaves.

51:53.708 --> 51:55.875
- Help us kill him.
- Why would I do that?

51:56.708 --> 51:58.041
Don't you have slaves too?

51:59.375 --> 52:02.625
Yes, but we have a deep respect
for human rights.

52:02.833 --> 52:04.208
You don't have slaves?

52:04.416 --> 52:05.833
- No.
- Yes.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.583
That's not what they are.
We have colleagues.

52:08.750 --> 52:09.583
Exactly.

52:09.750 --> 52:12.291
Colleagues who help us
with our daily tasks.

52:12.458 --> 52:14.041
Do you pay them?

52:14.750 --> 52:16.166
- No.
- Yes.

52:16.333 --> 52:17.416
We do pay them.

52:17.583 --> 52:20.083
What are you talking about?
They are well paid.

52:20.250 --> 52:24.000
We pay well above the average
of what other slaves earn.

52:24.541 --> 52:27.208
- The other slaves earn nothing.
- Exactly.

52:27.375 --> 52:29.083
That's right.

52:29.250 --> 52:31.291
I'll check.
And if you've lied to me...

52:33.166 --> 52:34.625
Let's get one thing straight:

52:34.833 --> 52:37.833
us former slaves
don't kill for our glory,

52:38.333 --> 52:39.416
but for our freedom!

52:40.833 --> 52:42.875
Freedom! Freedom!

52:45.541 --> 52:46.791
He's good.

52:47.250 --> 52:48.416
He is.

52:49.500 --> 52:50.958
He is, he's good.

52:54.291 --> 52:55.500
I wanted to...

52:56.166 --> 52:58.541
I haven't had the chance to thank you

52:58.750 --> 53:00.833
for telling all the villages to...

53:01.000 --> 53:03.583
to protect me.
You saved my life.

53:03.750 --> 53:05.541
- Of course I did.
- What?

53:07.166 --> 53:09.458
I saw you against the gladiators.

53:09.625 --> 53:12.000
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

53:12.208 --> 53:15.708
- What you thought you saw...
- Stop. You're too humble.

53:16.791 --> 53:19.125
There's something about you,
you unite people.

53:19.291 --> 53:20.750
People love you.

53:22.916 --> 53:23.875
Efna.

53:24.416 --> 53:27.208
She really likes you
and she hates all Romans.

53:27.625 --> 53:28.541
That's when...

53:30.708 --> 53:32.125
you fuck them up. Got it?

53:33.375 --> 53:36.458
You need to be ready at any age
to defend yourself.

53:37.458 --> 53:39.000
Why does she hate Romans?

53:39.208 --> 53:40.875
Vercingetorix.

53:41.541 --> 53:42.625
Oh, yeah, right.

53:42.833 --> 53:46.791
Vercingetorix was really something.
All of the Romans were scared of him.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.583
I know that we'll meet again.

53:49.208 --> 53:51.583
- Do you know where he is?
- He's dead.

53:53.125 --> 53:54.041
But...

53:54.583 --> 53:57.541
I'll see him again
at the Boulder of the Brave.

53:57.708 --> 53:58.583
What's that?

53:58.750 --> 54:01.375
The souls of our legendary warriors
lay to rest there.

54:19.583 --> 54:22.750
By the way, I spoke to Alorix
and I have to ask you to marry me.

54:22.916 --> 54:24.625
But you're allowed to decline.

54:25.375 --> 54:27.125
Oh, right. OK.

54:27.916 --> 54:29.708
Did Alorix tell you that?

54:30.750 --> 54:31.875
So, there you go.

54:32.625 --> 54:35.458
So, I wanted to...

54:38.625 --> 54:40.166
I, Brutus,

54:40.375 --> 54:43.541
own a bit of land
on the outskirts of Rome.

54:43.750 --> 54:46.333
- Why are you talking about Rome?
- That's where I live.

54:46.875 --> 54:49.958
- Wait, are you not staying here?
- Well, no.

54:50.541 --> 54:53.250
- But you can't go back.
- Why?

54:53.458 --> 54:55.708
Because I don't want...

54:57.166 --> 54:59.958
I thought you wanted to stay
to fight your dad together.

55:01.208 --> 55:04.375
- I'm not a Gaul.
- You could be if we got married.

55:04.541 --> 55:07.833
- We could...
- No, sorry, I can't.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.541
No, I have to go back to Rome.

55:10.750 --> 55:12.625
You were sleeping rough, Brutus.

55:12.791 --> 55:15.375
- What's holding you back?
- Rome's better than Gaul.

55:15.583 --> 55:17.666
Everything's better there.
You saw that.

55:17.875 --> 55:19.416
But I was a slave.

55:19.625 --> 55:22.041
I'd rather be a slave in Rome
than free here.

55:22.250 --> 55:25.333
I was tossed from master to master,
from house to house.

55:25.500 --> 55:28.708
- If you hadn't been heroic back there...
- I wasn't heroic.

55:29.250 --> 55:30.916
I don't even know how to fight.

55:31.125 --> 55:33.791
I know that!
I know you didn't fight.

55:34.750 --> 55:35.958
You gave us hope.

55:36.166 --> 55:39.833
I wish I'd never seen this side of you.
You're right, go back to Rome.

55:40.041 --> 55:40.916
Hold on.

55:42.208 --> 55:43.875
Why don't you just say no?

55:44.625 --> 55:46.166
You can turn down my proposal.

55:53.416 --> 55:54.625
Albana?

55:59.750 --> 56:01.291
Do you want to marry me?

56:07.208 --> 56:08.833
He said that to you?

56:09.000 --> 56:10.458
You're right, cut him out.

56:10.666 --> 56:12.750
In a way, I get it.

56:12.958 --> 56:14.541
He thinks we're savages.

56:14.750 --> 56:18.541
But what if I showed him that
we're kind and sophisticated?

56:18.750 --> 56:22.083
Yeah, you do that.
Show them that we're sophisticated.

56:23.541 --> 56:24.791
What's the problem?

56:26.000 --> 56:29.958
The problem is that I've got someone
holding me back both here and there.

56:31.375 --> 56:33.333
Ah, a foot in Rome and a foot in Gaul.

56:34.875 --> 56:36.125
Exactly.

56:36.333 --> 56:38.375
Mind your arse,
the Alps separate the two.

56:42.333 --> 56:44.291
Wait, this one will make you laugh.

56:44.458 --> 56:46.958
An Ostrogoth and a Visigoth
walk into a grocery...

56:47.166 --> 56:50.125
Why are we going along
with this nonsense?

56:50.291 --> 56:52.583
Would you rather die
or do your own laundry?

56:52.750 --> 56:54.833
One! We could've at least kept one.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.250
Then what would we have said
to Spartacus?

56:57.416 --> 56:59.208
I'm anti-slavery, but hate stains?

56:59.375 --> 57:01.833
You're a nice guy,
throw in the wheelbarrow.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.541
But not in the chimney!

57:07.708 --> 57:08.625
Not funny to you?

57:09.583 --> 57:11.500
Yes, but you already told us that one.

57:12.208 --> 57:14.625
- It's never as funny the second time.
- Of course.

57:17.458 --> 57:18.583
No, but I laughed.

57:19.291 --> 57:21.375
- I laughed, right?
- He did.

57:21.541 --> 57:23.583
He really did, we heard him.

57:23.791 --> 57:25.541
I thought it was hilarious, Caesar.

57:27.250 --> 57:29.875
Look!
Wait, Caesar, I'll give you names!

57:30.333 --> 57:31.583
I know

57:31.750 --> 57:33.708
who organised the attack on you...

57:33.875 --> 57:34.958
Whoa, enough.

57:35.166 --> 57:37.250
You didn't laugh, so, just own up to it.

57:37.416 --> 57:41.000
This is a place of work,
have a little respect!

57:41.208 --> 57:42.208
Right?

57:43.833 --> 57:47.458
So, when you meet in the evening...

57:49.166 --> 57:51.333
- drink this during dinner.
- This thing?

57:51.916 --> 57:54.416
That way, if she poisons you,
you'll be fine.

57:54.625 --> 57:57.250
Sorry?
I thought I heard you say "poison".

57:57.458 --> 58:00.375
I told you she'd accept,
not that she wouldn't try to kill you.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.166
It'll completely neutralise the poison.

58:04.750 --> 58:06.583
And then one hour later...

58:08.375 --> 58:09.458
I drink this.

58:09.666 --> 58:10.625
That?

58:11.583 --> 58:13.875
- OK.
- Yeah, because it helps me...

58:22.541 --> 58:23.666
I don't get it.

58:26.583 --> 58:27.958
Oh, OK...

58:28.166 --> 58:29.291
Got it.

58:31.875 --> 58:35.250
That's pretty awkward.
I'm going, Alorix. It was a pleasure.

58:36.250 --> 58:37.541
See you later.

58:41.250 --> 58:43.125
Excuse me, oh Caesar.

58:43.541 --> 58:44.791
Who's that?

58:45.708 --> 58:49.375
Centurion Decimus. I've fought for you
in Gaul for many years.

58:49.541 --> 58:52.250
- Always with pride and...
- Yeah, great.

58:53.875 --> 58:56.250
I came to tell you today

58:56.416 --> 58:59.458
that doubt has been cast
among our troops

58:59.666 --> 59:02.416
ever since your son Brutus
joined the enemy.

59:02.583 --> 59:04.125
Sorry, Caesar, but we saw it.

59:05.458 --> 59:06.458
That one.

59:07.875 --> 59:09.958
He lives with them, dresses like them.

59:10.125 --> 59:11.541
He eats with them.

59:12.666 --> 59:16.666
It even appears that he's become
very close to a certain Gaul.

59:19.125 --> 59:23.250
Your future grandchildren
are very likely to have Gaul blood.

59:24.041 --> 59:25.625
You will go back to Gaul,

59:26.375 --> 59:28.500
and you will kill that traitor.

59:29.166 --> 59:31.166
- Take 2,000 men.
- We don't have them.

59:32.208 --> 59:34.291
- What do you mean?
- That was your doing.

59:34.875 --> 59:36.875
Our army's off conquering the world.

59:37.875 --> 59:39.208
Can we do 1,500?

59:40.166 --> 59:41.541
They're guarding borders.

59:43.291 --> 59:44.166
Well...

59:44.916 --> 59:46.250
I'll give you what I can.

59:50.291 --> 59:51.208
Let's go.

59:51.791 --> 59:53.125
Where?

59:53.625 --> 59:55.125
To go get Brutus.

01:00:01.166 --> 01:00:02.416
Did you two talk?

01:00:03.791 --> 01:00:05.291
So, you haven't decided?

01:00:05.875 --> 01:00:06.958
No, I can't.

01:00:07.541 --> 01:00:10.000
The only question
you should ask yourself, son,

01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:13.875
is which of those two people
makes you happier.

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:38.000
He's not coming back.

01:00:39.166 --> 01:00:41.166
- I know.
- Then why are you here?

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:43.958
- To be sure that he doesn't come back.
- Every day?

01:00:48.541 --> 01:00:50.083
You know, I'm not Roman.

01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:53.250
- What are you, then?
- Armenian.

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:54.875
You're Armenian?

01:00:55.791 --> 01:00:57.583
So, you know how to fight?

01:00:57.791 --> 01:01:00.250
Why are you a medic?
Join us on the battlefield.

01:01:00.458 --> 01:01:03.541
Knowing how to fight
doesn't mean you like it.

01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:06.458
Back home, if you're not a killer,
you're not a man.

01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:08.875
It's true, you Armenians are savages.

01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:10.208
No more than you are.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.375
But you beat us,
so I had to make a choice.

01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:16.250
Join your army or die.

01:01:17.291 --> 01:01:18.541
What did you choose?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.500
Think, Claudius.

01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:28.291
Oh, yeah, duh.

01:01:30.916 --> 01:01:33.166
I wear the colours of Rome,
and don't belong,

01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:35.583
but I least I don't kill anyone here.

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:36.875
I treat them.

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:39.500
So, I belong.

01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:42.458
Well, he belongs with us.

01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:46.625
I'm Claudius, Brutus's brother.

01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:49.166
And I'm Albana, his wife.

01:01:49.375 --> 01:01:51.541
You know,
I've thought about it and agree.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:53.583
Let's go live in Rome.

01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:55.666
Show me this wonderful city.

01:01:55.875 --> 01:01:59.375
You'll see, Rome is awesome.

01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:01.875
I have loads of friends who...

01:02:02.041 --> 01:02:03.125
who...

01:02:05.291 --> 01:02:06.333
who...

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:11.125
Actually, I have no friends.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.541
It's nice being there
because that's all I know.

01:02:21.291 --> 01:02:23.875
And if I've never been able to leave,

01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:25.375
it's because...

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:42.875
But...

01:02:43.541 --> 01:02:46.458
But now, I'd rather be with you.

01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:48.458
Anywhere, as long as it's with you.

01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:51.041
Really?

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:55.875
Yes.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.875
If you agree to marry me...

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.958
I'll stay here.

01:03:07.791 --> 01:03:10.833
- I, Brutus, own...
- Wait. Save it for later.

01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:11.958
I'm thirsty.

01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:14.416
- Want some water?
- I have something better.

01:03:16.791 --> 01:03:18.250
It's our finest wine.

01:03:18.416 --> 01:03:20.250
- Here.
- OK.

01:03:21.208 --> 01:03:23.708
You want me to drink, is that it?

01:03:23.916 --> 01:03:27.833
I know that you have good wine in Rome,
but we can be sophisticated too.

01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:29.583
Yeah.

01:03:30.625 --> 01:03:32.000
Yeah, of course.

01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:35.791
- Are you not OK?
- Yes, I'm great.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.166
- Are you sure?
- Yes, of course.

01:03:39.375 --> 01:03:40.541
What's wrong?

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.708
We have this small ritual in Rome

01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:44.708
where before we taste a new wine,

01:03:44.875 --> 01:03:46.833
we have to say a prayer.

01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:49.125
So, I'm going to say a little prayer.

01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:50.625
My little prayer...

01:03:51.583 --> 01:03:52.708
for the wine.

01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:55.916
And then,

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:59.125
we'll let the prayer get right in there.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.875
There. And now, we can drink.

01:04:05.583 --> 01:04:06.833
There we go.

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:09.833
- You don't want it?
- I do.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.541
I'm savouring it.

01:04:12.166 --> 01:04:14.625
It starts in the mind.
Let's go on three.

01:04:14.791 --> 01:04:16.916
1, 2, 3.

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:24.708
I drank it.

01:04:24.916 --> 01:04:26.708
- Did you like it?
- I did.

01:04:26.916 --> 01:04:29.875
What about you?
Are you still angry?

01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:32.041
- No.
- OK.

01:04:32.625 --> 01:04:34.083
Great.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.166
I've got this thing.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.041
- I have to go do stuff.
- What?

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:42.250
- Stuff.
- What?

01:04:42.416 --> 01:04:44.041
See you later.

01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:47.166
No, wait, you've got it all wrong.

01:04:47.875 --> 01:04:49.916
For fuck's sake, Alorix!

01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:55.375
Sorry.

01:04:56.541 --> 01:04:57.791
It's not your fault.

01:04:58.583 --> 01:05:01.083
The good news is that you're staying.

01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:03.208
But I'm not killing any Romans.

01:05:03.416 --> 01:05:05.000
Nor anyone for that matter.

01:05:05.166 --> 01:05:07.041
Don't worry, there's still time.

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:09.041
We'll see.

01:05:09.208 --> 01:05:11.958
No, we won't.
I'm not killing anyone. Period.

01:05:12.166 --> 01:05:13.541
Even in self-defence?

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:14.875
Even in self-defence.

01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:17.333
- If it were an accident?
- There won't be any.

01:05:17.541 --> 01:05:19.583
- Choking in the woods?
- Not that either.

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:22.291
- A little stranglehold?
- Forget about it.

01:05:24.291 --> 01:05:26.083
There's still time.

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:49.625
Up.

01:05:55.458 --> 01:05:58.083
There's your advance.
Caesar has a mission for you.

01:05:58.791 --> 01:06:00.208
What do I have to do?

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:02.000
Kill them all.

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:03.791
Down to the very last Gaul.

01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:14.625
So, you're the Gaul specialist?

01:06:16.541 --> 01:06:19.041
Funny. I've met the centurions
that were sent here

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.750
and I've never seen you.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.541
I infiltrated the Gauls
to help capture Vercingetorix.

01:06:26.208 --> 01:06:27.875
- No?
- Yes.

01:06:28.041 --> 01:06:29.958
You've met him?

01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:32.375
Yes, I knew him well.

01:06:32.541 --> 01:06:35.875
But the Gauls mustn't see me,
they might recognise me.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:39.916
Of course,
as long as you help us kill them.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.958
We helped him
get a foot on the ladder.

01:06:46.166 --> 01:06:48.375
- We go way back!
- Exactly. Take it easy.

01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:52.416
Oh, look!

01:06:52.583 --> 01:06:54.208
- Do you know them?
- Yes, I do.

01:06:57.750 --> 01:07:00.458
- What are you doing here?
- Time's running out, let's go.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.208
- Where?
- To Rome, to finish the job.

01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:05.791
I don't feel like it anymore.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.166
Well, if he doesn't
feel like it anymore...

01:07:09.208 --> 01:07:11.708
You felt like it
when you were shouting "freedom".

01:07:11.875 --> 01:07:13.333
You weren't a team player.

01:07:13.541 --> 01:07:16.958
No, you went and did your own thing
and that...

01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:19.500
- That pisses me off.
- Brutus.

01:07:20.041 --> 01:07:21.958
Everyone's talking about you in Rome.

01:07:23.166 --> 01:07:24.708
Not everyone.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:26.958
A tiny minority is.

01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:28.500
Caesar's not doing OK.

01:07:28.708 --> 01:07:29.708
- Really?
- Really.

01:07:29.875 --> 01:07:32.000
Your disciple, Spartacus,
is hurting him.

01:07:32.166 --> 01:07:34.666
- My disciple?
- Yes, he says that you inspired him.

01:07:34.875 --> 01:07:36.333
OK, but this whole thing is...

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.541
This whole thing
has made you a symbol.

01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:40.583
That's the whole thing.

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:43.333
We'll hide you in Rome
and finish what we started:

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.125
kill Caesar.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.500
- You can say it out loud here.
- I'd rather not.

01:07:49.041 --> 01:07:50.541
- Hey, guys.
- Yeah?

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:53.291
- They want to kill Caesar.
- OK.

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.750
Well...

01:07:55.291 --> 01:07:57.750
We're very proud
and you can count on us.

01:07:57.916 --> 01:07:58.875
Let's go.

01:07:59.083 --> 01:08:02.375
What's wrong?
Why don't you want to come back?

01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:04.375
I'm getting married.

01:08:05.875 --> 01:08:07.416
To a Gaul?

01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:12.125
You wanna end up like Vercingetorix?

01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:18.332
Now we know that
he has allies in the Senate.

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.125
I'll wait for you here.

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:23.291
Let's wipe them out.

01:08:25.582 --> 01:08:26.582
Hold on.

01:08:28.791 --> 01:08:30.750
Caesar doesn't want anyone dead.

01:08:30.916 --> 01:08:33.291
Are you sure?
Doesn't he want them dead?

01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:35.666
No, he needs slaves.

01:08:35.875 --> 01:08:37.332
An army is approaching.

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:40.666
Hold on.

01:08:41.125 --> 01:08:43.207
Hold on.
We can talk about this!

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:45.957
Onward!

01:08:58.791 --> 01:08:59.916
Take Brutus.

01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:16.750
Come on!

01:09:38.125 --> 01:09:40.457
There's a smell.
What's that smell?

01:09:41.582 --> 01:09:43.457
What does it smell of?

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:47.957
Could that be the smell of victory?

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:55.750
It smells like we're going back to Rome!

01:09:58.625 --> 01:10:00.083
Right, Versus?

01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:02.458
Where's Versus? Versus?

01:10:03.375 --> 01:10:07.666
Come on, my friend, come say hi.
This is all thanks to you.

01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:10.541
No, I'm busy right now.
Maybe later.

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:12.958
As you wish.

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:14.750
As you wish, my friend.

01:10:15.208 --> 01:10:18.125
What's going on here?
No more applause?

01:10:18.916 --> 01:10:19.791
Come on!

01:10:22.583 --> 01:10:24.000
Are you Claudius?

01:10:25.166 --> 01:10:26.250
How do you know?

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.916
You're the only Roman who's sulking.

01:10:32.708 --> 01:10:34.708
Are you worried about your brother?

01:10:35.583 --> 01:10:36.916
Don't worry, he's fine.

01:10:58.625 --> 01:11:01.166
- Where are the others?
- Captured.

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.333
- Albana?
- Fuck her.

01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:06.125
She's the reason
those two led them to us!

01:11:06.291 --> 01:11:07.750
OK, let's calm down.

01:11:08.333 --> 01:11:11.000
- We're on the same side.
- Which side? Gaul or Roman?

01:11:11.208 --> 01:11:13.458
- Kill him, Efna!
- OK, cool it.

01:11:14.708 --> 01:11:17.125
This doesn't even concern us.

01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:18.458
We're toast now.

01:11:19.083 --> 01:11:20.375
Aren't you sick of this?

01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:24.375
There are five of us left
and you're still squabbling?

01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:26.458
- It's not our fault.
- Of course it is!

01:11:26.625 --> 01:11:28.583
It's been your fault since the start!

01:11:28.791 --> 01:11:30.958
If you want Caesar dead,
then kill him

01:11:31.166 --> 01:11:32.541
yourselves.

01:11:33.208 --> 01:11:35.375
- They're right, Efna.
- They're Romans.

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:37.666
- So are you!
- That's not all we are.

01:11:39.041 --> 01:11:40.250
I'm marrying a Gaul.

01:11:41.291 --> 01:11:42.375
I was a puppeteer.

01:11:43.416 --> 01:11:44.458
Legionary.

01:11:44.625 --> 01:11:46.208
And soon-to-be Roman-killer.

01:11:46.416 --> 01:11:48.500
- Not at all.
- Just a little...

01:11:50.333 --> 01:11:51.500
Caesar's to blame.

01:11:52.458 --> 01:11:54.375
He's not just being obeyed by Romans.

01:11:55.041 --> 01:11:56.666
I know, one of our villages betrayed us.

01:11:56.875 --> 01:11:58.916
It wasn't one of your villages.

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:00.750
It was your husband.

01:12:03.083 --> 01:12:04.333
Her husband?

01:12:05.916 --> 01:12:07.875
- I can see why he took off.
- Cut it out.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.708
He's in Rome, alive and kicking.

01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:13.833
Efna, I... I...

01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:16.291
can't imagine what you're going through.

01:12:16.458 --> 01:12:17.500
But he left.

01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:20.083
We can't bring him back.

01:12:22.041 --> 01:12:23.583
But Coria, she...

01:12:24.458 --> 01:12:27.208
Your daughter's still here
and so is your village.

01:12:29.041 --> 01:12:30.333
You have to save them.

01:12:32.291 --> 01:12:34.000
What can you do for us?

01:12:34.208 --> 01:12:36.125
You want to fight
but not kill the enemy?

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.583
It's all about
choosing the right weapon.

01:13:36.291 --> 01:13:37.666
"Sending you my love.

01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:41.291
Enjoy this last beautiful day in Gaul

01:13:41.708 --> 01:13:44.333
which is shaping up to be glorious."

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.333
One lone man.

01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:56.416
A Gaul.

01:13:57.416 --> 01:13:58.708
A Gaul?

01:14:04.625 --> 01:14:06.208
He's armed!

01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:10.875
I only know one Gaul
who would do that, but he's dead.

01:14:15.625 --> 01:14:17.375
- What's wrong?
- Vercingetorix!

01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:19.750
It's Vercingetorix!

01:14:20.291 --> 01:14:23.250
It's Gaul witchcraft.
We're screwed.

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.208
It's his spirit.

01:14:25.625 --> 01:14:26.833
He's come to save us.

01:14:27.416 --> 01:14:29.291
He's coming! He's coming!

01:14:31.458 --> 01:14:33.458
What the hell is going on?

01:14:33.625 --> 01:14:35.166
Vercingetorix.

01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:38.541
He's really close!

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:40.708
Move... Move!

01:14:40.875 --> 01:14:43.541
- What should we do?
- Let them go. He'll leave us alone.

01:14:44.166 --> 01:14:45.416
Get up.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.250
Don't free anyone!

01:14:47.458 --> 01:14:49.750
- You trying to get us killed?
- It's not him!

01:14:49.916 --> 01:14:53.125
- What do you know?
- Shut it. I need to think.

01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:55.875
He's coming.
Let's not get killed for some Gauls.

01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:59.500
Calm down. We're safe in the camp.
If we leave, we're vulnerable.

01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:01.125
That's ridiculous.

01:15:01.291 --> 01:15:03.875
Everyone, after him!
I'm the one in charge!

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:05.458
Get your fighting gear on!

01:15:06.875 --> 01:15:08.916
Helmet, armour!

01:15:13.416 --> 01:15:15.291
What the hell am I doing?

01:15:57.333 --> 01:15:59.833
- He's going to charge.
- What shall we do?

01:16:25.041 --> 01:16:26.291
Albana!

01:19:30.416 --> 01:19:33.166
I, Brutus, own nothing.

01:19:33.833 --> 01:19:37.041
I don't know what I am
nor what tomorrow will bring.

01:19:37.875 --> 01:19:39.458
But I know I want you by my side.

01:19:39.958 --> 01:19:41.291
Will you...?

01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:13.708
They hate us.

01:20:15.583 --> 01:20:17.458
This is going to be a long ride.

01:20:17.625 --> 01:20:19.458
Give them time, Cassius.

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:22.833
Go on, budge up.

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:27.666
- Wanna add something?
- What's that?

01:20:27.833 --> 01:20:30.708
A little something I invented:
a nest egg for the couple.

01:20:30.916 --> 01:20:35.000
Everyone can add what they want:
money, jewellery, dresses...

01:20:36.041 --> 01:20:37.625
I don't have anything. Sorry.

01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:40.875
It's just to give them a leg up
and give them more...

01:20:42.166 --> 01:20:43.458
more freedom.

01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:46.916
More freedom?

01:20:48.583 --> 01:20:50.041
I'll go find something.

01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:52.291
Great. Thanks.

01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:54.708
If you wouldn't mind...

01:20:54.875 --> 01:20:56.166
We can't...

01:20:56.833 --> 01:20:58.625
We can't see very much, sir.

01:20:58.791 --> 01:21:01.208
Thank you all for being here.

01:21:01.416 --> 01:21:03.916
Friends, we're gathered here today
to celebrate

01:21:04.083 --> 01:21:05.166
two events:

01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:08.250
the first is the creation
of a Gaul coalition.

01:21:08.416 --> 01:21:12.250
Flag! Flag! Flag!

01:21:13.041 --> 01:21:16.166
Hold on, there's a protocol.

01:21:16.333 --> 01:21:19.583
From now on, our four flags
will be made up of just one.

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:20.708
Curtain!

01:21:25.833 --> 01:21:27.833
But... Who did...?

01:21:32.416 --> 01:21:35.000
Right, last,

01:21:35.166 --> 01:21:36.875
but not least,

01:21:37.041 --> 01:21:39.750
is the wedding of our two dear children:

01:21:39.916 --> 01:21:41.875
Brutus and Albana.

01:21:42.041 --> 01:21:43.958
So, please, before we bring them out...

01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:45.500
Hold on, hold on.

01:21:51.666 --> 01:21:54.250
- You came in too early.
- But you called us over.

01:21:54.458 --> 01:21:56.750
- Didn't he call us over?
- Yes, but...

01:21:56.916 --> 01:21:58.458
OK, well, they're here now,

01:21:58.625 --> 01:22:01.875
may they have many children
and may just as many Romans die.

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:03.708
There you go.

01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:08.291
We'll start the ceremony,
but stick to tradition.

01:22:08.458 --> 01:22:09.625
Long live the couple!

01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:12.666
Long live the couple!

01:22:12.875 --> 01:22:14.750
Hold on, you've come in too early.

01:22:16.041 --> 01:22:17.291
Not just yet!

01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:24.666
And now the doves...

01:22:24.875 --> 01:22:26.750
No, you ruin everything!

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.708
Freedom to the doves!

01:22:32.541 --> 01:22:33.666
What's up?

01:22:35.208 --> 01:22:36.791
Let's go open the last cage.

01:22:44.541 --> 01:22:46.000
So, this is it?

01:22:46.166 --> 01:22:48.833
- You finally decided to kill me?
- Why would I do that?

01:22:49.041 --> 01:22:51.666
You're just a messenger.
You're going to go see my dad.

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:54.791
You have no father,
you have no family.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.041
You have no homeland,
you have no honour.

01:22:58.416 --> 01:23:01.916
Caesar will make your life a misery
until his last breath.

01:23:02.416 --> 01:23:03.708
Then he'll have to die.

01:23:04.208 --> 01:23:07.333
You think that you, of all people,
will kill Caesar?

01:23:08.208 --> 01:23:09.791
I don't want to kill Caesar.

01:23:11.916 --> 01:23:13.125
I want to kill Rome!

01:23:19.041 --> 01:23:20.625
Kill Rome?

01:23:21.083 --> 01:23:22.125
Antonia,

01:23:22.291 --> 01:23:24.166
gather all the troops,

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.833
we're going to Gaul.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.166
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know.

01:23:31.666 --> 01:23:34.000
You were supposed to tell him
to leave us alone.

01:23:34.166 --> 01:23:37.333
We leave Rome, Rome leaves us.
That was the message.

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:41.416
I know, but he provoked me.
It sounded good at the time.

01:23:44.583 --> 01:23:46.125
Honestly, I know Caesar.

01:23:46.291 --> 01:23:48.875
He's a busy man,
he won't even notice us.

01:23:49.041 --> 01:23:51.416
- We're screwed.
- We're royally screwed.

01:27:17.208 --> 01:27:20.208
