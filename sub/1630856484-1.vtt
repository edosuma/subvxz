WEBVTT

02:11.714 --> 02:13.258
- Hello?
-  <i>Carmen?</i>

02:14.092 --> 02:15.009
Yeah?

02:15.093 --> 02:16.594
<i>Hi, it's Griselda.</i>

02:19.097 --> 02:20.890
Griselda? You okay?

02:20.974 --> 02:24.978
Listen, I know it's been a while,
but I need a favor.

02:25.061 --> 02:26.354
<i>What's going on?</i>

02:27.730 --> 02:29.899
Something just happened
between me and Alberto

02:29.983 --> 02:33.194
and I thought if anyone would understand--

02:33.278 --> 02:34.779
<i>Oh, honey. I'm sorry.</i>

02:34.863 --> 02:36.322
You wanna talk about it?

02:36.406 --> 02:38.408
<i>Yeah, when I get there.</i>

02:39.033 --> 02:41.035
Here? You're coming to Miami?

02:41.119 --> 02:44.080
With the kids. You have an extra room.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.165
<i>Right?</i>

02:46.040 --> 02:49.419
Yeah, but it's really small.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.171
<i>We'll be there in the morning.</i>

02:52.130 --> 02:55.008
Carmen. Thank you so much.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.139
Shit.

03:05.476 --> 03:06.311
Ready.

03:07.562 --> 03:08.646
Mom--

03:08.730 --> 03:11.816
It's so early.
Couldn't we take a later flight?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.818
- Are you fucking packed?
- Yes.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.949
- What about Alberto?
- I'll explain in the car.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.035
Where's Ozzy?

03:22.118 --> 03:24.454
Not sure. In the bathroom?

03:27.874 --> 03:30.501
Ozzy, we have to go now!

03:30.585 --> 03:33.922
Just a minute, I have to poop before I go
on the plane and it won't come out.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.340
Hurry!

03:42.680 --> 03:43.514
Let's go.

04:03.868 --> 04:04.702
Mom.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.206
Alberto and I are getting a divorce.

04:09.707 --> 04:12.085
And we're moving to Miami.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.797
I hated that fuck face anyways.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.091
Don't talk about your father like that.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.300
He's not my father.

04:19.384 --> 04:22.637
Dixon, I don't need
the fucking attitude right now.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.431
You need to work on your English.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.977
I don't want to go to Miami.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.854
I know, baby.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.399
But everything will be all right.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.217
This is it.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.894
- Carmen, your house is beautiful.
- Thank you. It's getting there.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.189
I can't believe you're really here.

05:56.814 --> 05:57.732
Me neither.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.069
You wouldn't believe
the fucking day I've had.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.906
We'll talk, all right?
Let me show you the room. Come on.

06:05.990 --> 06:06.824
Come on.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.119
This is the room.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.374
It's great.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.251
One of you can sleep in the chair.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.169
Fuck that.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.087
Dixon!

06:19.796 --> 06:21.339
I'm sorry, long flight.

06:21.422 --> 06:24.717
No, it's okay. I wouldn't want
to sleep on that chair either, Dixon.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.638
So, um, how long do you think
you'll be staying?

06:28.721 --> 06:30.932
Just until I get on my feet.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.016
Find a place.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.392
I hope it's okay with you.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.812
Of course. I'll let you get settled.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.648
Stop it, Dixon!

06:38.731 --> 06:39.565
Enough!

06:39.649 --> 06:41.150
Listen, please.

06:42.276 --> 06:45.488
Soon as I can afford
our own place, we'll leave.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.907
- I promise.

06:47.990 --> 06:51.994
In the meantime,
I need you to be good guests.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.288
Don't be assholes.

06:54.372 --> 06:58.376
No cursing,
and put the fucking toilet seat down.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.712
Mom, how do you know her?

07:01.796 --> 07:03.631
You guys met her in Colombia.

07:03.714 --> 07:08.302
Alberto and I used to hang out
with her when we'd go to New York.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.680
Why doesn't she speak Spanish?

07:10.763 --> 07:15.309
She grew up here. That's what happens.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.437
I don't wanna speak English all the time.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.896
I know.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.566
Check this out.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.443
"Fuck you."

07:23.526 --> 07:25.570
All you need to know.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.990
You don't need to speak English
to know she doesn't want us here.

07:29.740 --> 07:30.575
I know, dear.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.660
I'm working on that.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.460
I still can't believe you're here.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.462
Me either.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.881
I know it's a lot to ask.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.216
So, I just want you to know
that if you have a problem,

07:47.300 --> 07:48.634
I can just find a motel and--

07:48.718 --> 07:50.178
No, Griselda, it's not that.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.513
You know I sympathize
with what you're going through.

07:52.597 --> 07:56.309
My divorce from Reynaldo
was fucking brutal, okay?

07:57.351 --> 07:58.186
But--

07:58.269 --> 08:01.606
You don't want me bringing
that shit back around you, I get it.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.484
There's a lot of women
who leave the man, not the life.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.278
You don't know what he did to me.

08:08.696 --> 08:09.530
He hit you?

08:10.198 --> 08:11.532
Worse.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.202
Listen, Carmen.

08:14.285 --> 08:19.874
I didn't call you just because
we had so many good times together.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.462
I called you because I saw what you did.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.423
You didn't just tell Reynaldo to fuck off.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.885
You came out. You did your thing.

08:30.968 --> 08:33.721
Now you have your own travel agency.

08:33.804 --> 08:34.639
It...

08:35.264 --> 08:36.766
It's fucking inspiring.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.395
All that time as a stewardess
had to count for something.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.773
You know, that's what I want too.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.525
What?

08:47.818 --> 08:49.028
A business of my own.

08:51.072 --> 08:55.076
After all that I have been through,
I swear, Carmen,

08:56.244 --> 08:59.413
I am fucking out of the drug business.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.712
Why don't you come work
with me at the agency?

09:08.839 --> 09:11.759
You know, to help you get started.
See how a business runs.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.470
What time do we start?

09:15.096 --> 09:17.557
8:00 a.m. And don't be fucking late.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.727
Someone's gonna really enjoy
being my fucking boss.

09:22.645 --> 09:27.108
To Alberto and Reynaldo.
May they one day get what they deserve.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.819
I'll fucking drink to that.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.140
Hm.

10:59.367 --> 11:04.413
If we can get 65 kilos
out of this paste, the boss will love us.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.415
That's why you study math, right?

11:06.499 --> 11:07.333
Arturo?

11:08.542 --> 11:09.377
It's your mom.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.711
Oh, dear...

11:10.795 --> 11:11.629
On the phone.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.214
She just doesn't stop.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.599
- Mom, I've told you--
-  <i>Arturo, it's me.</i>

11:26.435 --> 11:28.938
What the fuck, Griselda!
You shouldn't be calling me.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.439
Are you and the boys okay?

11:30.523 --> 11:32.817
<i>Yes, I'm fine. We're fine.</i>

11:32.900 --> 11:34.610
Does he know where I'm at?

11:34.693 --> 11:37.113
- Nobody knows, and don't tell me--
<i>- I'm in Miami.</i>

11:37.196 --> 11:38.239
Fuck.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.330
He doesn't know where you are,
but he has people looking for you.

11:46.997 --> 11:50.334
What about you? Did they rough you up?

11:50.418 --> 11:54.713
No, I'm just the accountant.
And I told them the truth. I didn't know.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.257
<i>Thank God.</i>

11:56.340 --> 11:57.675
Arturo, listen.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.009
I got out with a kilo.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.761
<i>And I need to sell it.</i>

12:01.470 --> 12:03.973
I can stay here and start over again.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.517
Build my own thing.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.185
<i>I think it's time.</i>

12:08.269 --> 12:10.688
Is that a good idea?

12:11.355 --> 12:13.566
The best I've had in a while.

12:13.649 --> 12:19.613
<i>Remember that guy, Manny Suarez,
who used to buy coke from Fernando?</i>

12:19.697 --> 12:21.740
Yeah, the Miami guy. He's dead.

12:21.824 --> 12:28.372
<i>Yeah, but he used to talk about
a spot up here where all the action was.</i>

12:28.456 --> 12:29.373
The Mutiny.

12:30.749 --> 12:31.709
The Mutiny.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.587
That's right.

12:34.670 --> 12:37.798
Sweetie, I'm going
to share some advice with you.

12:39.884 --> 12:40.801
Be careful.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.846
<i>You got nobody looking out for you.</i>

12:45.055 --> 12:48.476
I've never had
anyone looking out for me except you.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.480
Gotta go. I'll talk to you soon.

12:52.563 --> 12:56.025
- If you want, I could come over--

12:57.318 --> 13:00.571
-  How was lunch?
- It was fine. Any customers?

13:00.654 --> 13:01.614
Nope.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.075
But the mailman came in.

13:05.743 --> 13:09.705
I tried to sell him on some
Puerto Vallarta ticket, but nothing.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.500
It gets easier.
I can help you with your pitch.

13:12.583 --> 13:17.671
You know, I do need all the help
you can give me with that. Yes, please.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.383
Okay, good. Take your lunch.
Coffee shop around the corner is good.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.177
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

13:37.608 --> 13:38.609
Wipe that again.

13:39.777 --> 13:40.653
It's not clean.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.951
Get your eyes checked, asshole.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.622
You Colombian?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.334
Yeah.

13:56.293 --> 13:59.755
But I came to America to wash dishes.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.466
I know the feeling.

14:25.906 --> 14:26.740

15:35.601 --> 15:37.645
Fuck! That was full.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.856
It's all right.
Hey, I'm going to buy you another one.

15:41.815 --> 15:42.650
Okay?

15:43.984 --> 15:44.818
Problem solved.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.321
<i>Coral Gables Travel.</i>

15:47.404 --> 15:49.573
I think I know that place.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.993
Maybe I'll come down there,
buy some tickets to Rio.

15:53.077 --> 15:53.994
Expensive.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.037
That's no problem.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.873
Shit, I practically live
in a suite upstairs here.

15:59.833 --> 16:03.170
Then I guess you like
the finer things, huh?

16:05.714 --> 16:07.549
Fuck.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.636
- I bumped into the right chick.

16:11.428 --> 16:14.515
- It's not your skinny gringo lines.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.018
No problem, mama. No problem.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.982
What's going on back there?

16:24.692 --> 16:27.778
Rafo Rodriguez. Call him Amilcar.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.489
You work for him?

16:30.572 --> 16:34.034
We all work for him, mama.
In one way or another.

16:34.118 --> 16:34.994
Mm.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.207
Oh, fuck.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.251
Ooh!

16:43.502 --> 16:44.712
You know your shit.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.839
Not the garbage you're used to, huh?

16:46.922 --> 16:49.383
Hmm, yeah. Mmm.

16:54.555 --> 16:59.435
You know, I might even
be able to sell you a kilo.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.688
Hold on. You some kind
of dealer now or something?

17:04.148 --> 17:06.900
Do I look like a dealer to you?

17:07.484 --> 17:09.319
And what makes you think I'm buying?

17:10.195 --> 17:13.157
- Now, I've seen your type.
- Huh?

17:13.240 --> 17:16.618
- Yeah, nice clothes, walk a little...
- Hmm.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.496
- Little too fast, talk a little too much.
- Mm-hmm.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.666
You need the work. I respect that.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.963
- Hot damn. Kojak with titties.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.885
- You know what?
- Hmm?

17:34.636 --> 17:37.014
I got a better idea. Come with me, mama.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.104
Let me do the talking, okay?

17:49.318 --> 17:50.152
Move out of the way.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.154
Who is this?

17:52.237 --> 17:53.822
Get out of the way, you fucking goon!

17:58.827 --> 18:00.996
Damn. Let's go.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.460
Next time, watch your fucking mouth.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.798
What do you want, Johnny?

18:11.965 --> 18:13.801
I've got some coke you've got to try.

18:13.884 --> 18:14.843
What are you doing?

18:14.927 --> 18:18.430
- I'm just giving him a taste. That's it.
- Hey--

18:18.514 --> 18:20.307
Come on, Johnny.
Let the man enjoy his drink.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.309
Boss, we got a kilo of this shit.

18:22.392 --> 18:25.312
Hey, there's no we. It's my coke.

18:25.395 --> 18:28.190
Oh, Johnny, taking mommy's coke again?
Is that what you're doing?

18:28.273 --> 18:29.650
- I'm serious--
- No, I don't want--

18:29.733 --> 18:31.485
- No! Come on. God damn it.
- I'm sorry.

18:31.568 --> 18:32.820
Okay, I'm sorry.

18:32.903 --> 18:33.904
God.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.572
-  Let's go.
-  Mm-mm.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.575
Listen.

18:39.409 --> 18:42.746
I have an uncut kilo,
and I don't give a fuck who buys it.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.249
You Colombian?

18:47.084 --> 18:47.918
Good ear.

18:48.752 --> 18:49.962
You sound like a gringo.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.004
No, no, no.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.757
I came here as a kid from Venezuela.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.719
My dad was a cop, but he didn't like
the politics over there, so--

18:57.803 --> 19:00.597
Cop? What does he think about all of this?

19:00.681 --> 19:01.515
Mm.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.725
Well, his kid is living
the American dream,

19:03.809 --> 19:06.937
and, uh, he's driving
a brand-new Caddy, so...

19:12.234 --> 19:13.694
Sourced from Caquetá.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.406
You can still...
smell the jungle when you heat it.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.323
Mmm.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.993
I smuggled a kilo in my son's suitcase.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.619
Oh, your son's suitcase.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.163
Yeah. He's 11.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.167
Smarter than Johnny,
but as much of a pain in the ass.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.543
Now, that's hard to do.

19:33.922 --> 19:34.756
Oh.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.969
Thirty grand. But for the cop's son, 25.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.137
Mm-hmm.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.849
Uh, look, listen...

19:43.932 --> 19:48.770
...you need to understand that my business
runs on volume, all right?

19:49.938 --> 19:52.858
So what am I going
to do with one kilo, huh?

19:52.941 --> 19:54.693
Hmm? Hmm?

19:57.696 --> 19:59.740
Now get the fuck out of here, okay?

20:00.365 --> 20:02.284
And take this idiot with you.

20:13.962 --> 20:14.796
Hey.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.341
- Where you going?
- Home.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.052
You fucking embarrassed me
in front of my boss.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.929
Come on, you did that on your own.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.514
Give me the fucking kilo.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.725
I don't have it.

20:26.808 --> 20:27.643
No?

20:29.061 --> 20:32.272
Please don't do that. I have three kids
and we lost everything--

20:32.356 --> 20:35.651
They're going to lose their mom
if you don't give me the fucking kilo.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.613
Fucking get it!

20:58.465 --> 21:01.510
Now get the fuck out of here.
And don't come back.

21:17.192 --> 21:18.777
No!

22:06.908 --> 22:07.743
Mom?

22:09.119 --> 22:10.787
Ozzy, you startled me.

22:11.955 --> 22:12.789
Come here.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.223
I miss Alberto.

22:33.935 --> 22:35.270
I know.

22:37.522 --> 22:38.815
I miss my fish too.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.797
Alberto, can't you wait
till we get inside?

23:01.880 --> 23:04.382
Your brother always serves it
like an appetizer.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.512
We're not here for a dinner party.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.518
We lost two more shipments in New York.

23:15.769 --> 23:16.853
Half a million worth.

23:18.855 --> 23:20.982
I told you we should pull back.

23:21.566 --> 23:22.734
You were right, but...

23:23.527 --> 23:26.488
All that matters right now
is Fernando wants his money.

23:27.989 --> 23:31.118
So you'll pay him double
on the next shipment.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.410
We can't.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.831
He's cutting us off.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.835
We will find another source.

23:40.794 --> 23:44.172
No one's gonna hire smugglers
who lose shipments.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.174
We're fucked.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.927
Then why the fuck are we here?

23:51.555 --> 23:53.598
Because he always had a thing for you.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.018
So?

23:58.728 --> 24:00.105
One night, Griselda.

24:02.023 --> 24:04.401
One night with him,
he'll wipe our debt clean.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.488
Are you fucking kidding?

24:08.572 --> 24:11.575
Baby, please.
It's not a big deal if you think about it.

24:12.159 --> 24:15.036
I mean, you used to do this for a living.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.792
- I'm leaving.
- Wait.

24:20.876 --> 24:24.212
I know I should've listened
to you, my brilliant, beautiful wife.

24:25.881 --> 24:29.134
Look what we built,
our business, our family.

24:29.759 --> 24:32.596
Fernando's jealous of what we have.
That's why he wants you.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.891
Any other time, I'd kill him
for even asking for this.

24:37.475 --> 24:39.060
But he's got us.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.814
And only you can save us.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.942
Save the boys.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.308
He's upstairs.

26:13.321 --> 26:14.155
Mom?

26:15.865 --> 26:17.534
When are we leaving this place?

27:29.522 --> 27:31.358
Hi, welcome.

27:31.441 --> 27:32.650
Something to drink?

27:33.401 --> 27:34.486
Coffee, thanks.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.767
Ahhh! What the fuck?

28:05.850 --> 28:09.771
Fucking selling my coke to that guy? Huh?
Does your boss know what you're doing?

28:09.854 --> 28:12.399
What is he going to do to you,
Johnny, when he finds out?

28:14.234 --> 28:17.070
What the hell do you want?

28:17.153 --> 28:18.780
Get me a meeting with that guy.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.658
Or I'm gonna tell Amilcar
what you're fucking doing!

28:21.741 --> 28:23.368
Okay!

28:24.285 --> 28:28.081
But if you fuck this up,
they're going to kill the both of us.

28:28.164 --> 28:30.291
Get me a fucking meeting!

28:33.753 --> 28:36.756
Fucking bitch.
Oh, shit.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.891
Come on.
You were supposed to call me--

28:46.975 --> 28:49.477
I don't talk about this shit
over the phone.

28:49.561 --> 28:50.395
Meeting's set.

28:50.478 --> 28:52.230
What meeting, Griselda?

28:52.313 --> 28:53.148
Nothing.

28:53.231 --> 28:55.275
He works for Uber's school.

28:55.358 --> 28:56.484
Your boss.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.903
- Let's talk outside.
- Your girl's selling coke.

28:59.612 --> 29:01.990
9:00 p.m. Don't be late.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.912
- You're so fucking fired.
- Don't, Carmen.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.456
No, I'm done. I'm done.

29:10.498 --> 29:12.208
This is not what you think it is.

29:12.292 --> 29:16.004
Oh, no. It's not that you lied
to my face after I took you in?

29:16.087 --> 29:19.549
I know, but I had already
brought it from Medellín.

29:19.632 --> 29:22.761
There's coke in my house?
Are you fucking kidding me?

29:22.844 --> 29:23.970
It's just one kilo.

29:24.053 --> 29:25.430
- Oh, my God. My--
- One kilo.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.348
It's gonna be out
of your house by tonight.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.267
I want <i>you</i> out of my house by tonight.

29:30.226 --> 29:33.104
Carmen, no. This is a one-time thing.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.023
I just needed some extra money

29:35.106 --> 29:37.901
to be able to find a place
and get out of your hair.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.778
That's why I gave you the job.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.446
I know, and I am very grateful.

29:42.071 --> 29:45.074
But, we've had
six fucking customers all week.

29:45.158 --> 29:48.453
And I need
to feed three kids, buy a house.

29:48.536 --> 29:50.246
I can't do that by working here.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.790
Or you can't let it go.

29:53.374 --> 29:54.542
I can't let it go?

29:58.546 --> 30:02.634
You wanna know why I finally left Alberto?

30:05.136 --> 30:07.639
He made me fuck his brother.

30:08.848 --> 30:10.225
To pay his debt.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.354
You're right.

30:16.022 --> 30:17.732
I should have told you the truth.

30:20.193 --> 30:21.236
But...

30:22.779 --> 30:27.200
I... I swear, I'm out of the business.

30:27.283 --> 30:29.452
This is what that life does,
you convince yourself,

30:29.536 --> 30:31.412
"A little more money,
a little more juice,"

30:31.496 --> 30:33.248
then people start getting hurt.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.457
I'm not trying to hurt you.

30:34.541 --> 30:38.002
Listen. I can't have this shit in my life.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.838
It nearly killed me once.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.550
And you fucking lied to me. I trusted you.

30:46.469 --> 30:47.303
Okay.

30:48.763 --> 30:50.348
We'll be out by tomorrow.

30:51.891 --> 30:52.725
Good.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.020
I'm sorry, Carmen.

30:58.147 --> 30:59.148
I'm sorry too.

31:21.504 --> 31:25.675
So I'd be like your bodyguard.

31:25.758 --> 31:29.095
I just need you
to stand there and look dangerous.

31:29.178 --> 31:31.723
$200. One night of work.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.643
Why me?

31:35.727 --> 31:38.730
Hey. Break's over.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.690
There's no sitting with the customers.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.150
She's my sister.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.571
I just flew in from Colombia to see him,

31:46.654 --> 31:49.324
so fuck off
and let me talk with my brother.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.632
Okay. I'll do it.

32:06.966 --> 32:09.677
I can wear my boots
so I look bigger, if you want.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.429
That's okay.

32:12.013 --> 32:13.348
But can you get a gun?

32:14.724 --> 32:15.558
No.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.186
Thought I just had to look dangerous?

32:21.064 --> 32:22.649
I'll take care of it.

32:23.650 --> 32:26.361
How about a suit. You got something nice?

32:26.444 --> 32:28.905
Not really. I wash dishes, lady.

33:07.026 --> 33:10.071
No. Give it a second.
Don't want to seem too eager.

33:10.697 --> 33:13.074
Hey! Let's fucking go!

33:14.826 --> 33:18.371
Okay, come 'round
and open the door for me.

33:43.646 --> 33:47.066
This is Chucho,
in case you wanna try any more bullshit.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.820
Let's fucking go then.

33:57.076 --> 33:58.411
The Cuban's name is Eddie.

34:00.204 --> 34:01.497
They call him The Bird.

34:03.249 --> 34:04.375
You'll see why.

34:05.752 --> 34:06.836
Try not to stare.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.187
The lovely Griselda.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.564
The famous Eddie.

34:29.650 --> 34:30.902
Something to drink?

34:30.985 --> 34:32.320
Nice rum here.

34:32.403 --> 34:33.488
No, thank you.

34:38.910 --> 34:39.744
Yes.

34:44.624 --> 34:48.544
So... what can I do for you?

34:50.963 --> 34:53.132
I heard that you liked my product.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.759
Beautiful.

34:55.551 --> 34:59.097
Was like shoving
a fucking coca plant up my nose.

35:03.267 --> 35:04.894
Given the size of that thing,

35:04.977 --> 35:07.355
I bet you have
the whole fucking brick up there.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.832
What big stones!

35:27.458 --> 35:30.711
Johnny, she's got more balls than you do.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.171
Where did you find her?

35:32.255 --> 35:36.134
That asshole tried to steal my coke.
I had to beat him with a baseball bat.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.387
Is that right?

35:40.763 --> 35:42.723
Let's just get back to business, okay?

35:46.144 --> 35:46.978
So?

35:47.812 --> 35:49.021
What you got for me?

35:50.773 --> 35:52.316
A kilo of what you liked.

35:54.443 --> 35:55.945
$25,000.

35:57.488 --> 35:58.447
Fuck off.

35:59.365 --> 36:00.992
I pay 18 now.

36:03.411 --> 36:04.245
Yeah.

36:06.455 --> 36:09.333
But for that shit
that you can only cut once.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.836
Mine you can cut two, three times,

36:11.919 --> 36:14.589
and it's better than anything
that is out there right now.

36:18.134 --> 36:18.968
Nineteen.

36:19.051 --> 36:20.052
Twenty.

36:20.553 --> 36:21.846
That's my final offer.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.019
Okay.

36:32.148 --> 36:36.068
But first, you're going
to do something for me.

36:39.071 --> 36:39.906
Sure.

36:43.784 --> 36:44.785
Touch it.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.122
Come on.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.042
Just be gentle, mama.

36:56.797 --> 36:59.508
You want me to touch your nose?

37:01.427 --> 37:04.138
Nice and slow.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.653
That's so nice, Eddie.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.655
And big, no?

37:21.822 --> 37:22.782
Mmm.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.701
But I've had bigger.

37:28.829 --> 37:31.165
Fuck!

37:33.626 --> 37:36.671
Be careful with that woman, damn.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.217
So, we have a deal?

37:43.803 --> 37:46.347
Griselda Blanco, we have a deal.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.901
Let's celebrate, <i>mami.</i>

37:59.735 --> 38:01.153
Let's celebrate.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.073
Yes.

38:06.659 --> 38:07.493
<i>Salud.</i>

38:13.582 --> 38:14.417
Come on.

38:15.251 --> 38:16.377
Just follow my feet.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.339
Come on, <i>mami.</i>

39:16.479 --> 39:17.646
Shit!

40:16.288 --> 40:17.915
Go home, lady.

41:37.661 --> 41:38.704
Give me a ride?

42:23.666 --> 42:24.959
Thanks for the ride.

42:44.603 --> 42:46.814
What're you doing here?
What happened with Fernando?

42:48.566 --> 42:52.111
A man pays a woman to leave,
not spend the night.

42:53.529 --> 42:54.905
So you did it.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.618
Did you enjoy it?

43:00.369 --> 43:04.039
Are you serious?
I just paid off your fucking debt.

43:04.123 --> 43:05.708
I asked you a question.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.421
I'll take that as yes.

43:10.504 --> 43:12.715
You know, now I don't know what's worse,

43:12.798 --> 43:15.467
that you asked me
to do this or that I agreed to it.

43:19.054 --> 43:21.682
Look, I'm sorry,
I just lost my head for a minute.

43:21.765 --> 43:22.891
It's who you are.

43:23.684 --> 43:24.768
And I'm done with it.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.604
I'm leaving you.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.607
You aren't going anywhere, you hear me?

43:30.482 --> 43:32.860
Bravos own Medellín!

43:32.943 --> 43:34.570
Then I'll go somewhere else,

43:34.653 --> 43:38.240
build a life without you
tied around my neck like a fucking anchor.

43:38.324 --> 43:41.201
Are you kidding? I made you.

43:41.285 --> 43:44.121
Those fancy clothes on your back,
those jewels on your ears.

43:44.913 --> 43:48.334
Fuck you! I earned all of that.
We were partners.

43:48.417 --> 43:49.543
Partners?

43:49.627 --> 43:51.879
You came up with one fucking idea.

43:51.962 --> 43:55.090
Otherwise, you were eye candy
for the apes I had to deal with.

43:56.592 --> 43:59.637
Without me, you're nothing.
You'll come crawling back in a week.

43:59.720 --> 44:00.804
Let go of me!

44:00.888 --> 44:03.641
Just some old piece of ass
with three brat kids.

44:03.724 --> 44:05.809
Let's see how fucking far you get!

44:09.521 --> 44:12.066
- You want to see how far I get?

44:54.483 --> 44:59.405
<i>Let's see how fucking far you get!</i>

45:18.257 --> 45:19.508
I said go home.

45:19.591 --> 45:21.635
Yeah, I don't have one.

45:21.718 --> 45:22.845
Hey!

45:22.928 --> 45:24.304
Good job tonight.

45:27.099 --> 45:29.810
You guys go, okay?
I'll come back in a little bit.

Yeah, thanks to you.

45:48.245 --> 45:50.789
Hey, that's business, okay? That's it.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.791
I know. That's why I'm here.

45:55.502 --> 45:58.589
I just need you to try my fucking coke.

45:59.506 --> 46:01.383
Because when you do, you'll realize

46:01.467 --> 46:04.011
that it's ten times better
than any of that shit

46:04.094 --> 46:05.679
that you're selling everywhere.

46:06.430 --> 46:09.266
And that you and me
can make a lot of money together.

46:45.469 --> 46:46.303
It's excellent.

46:48.347 --> 46:49.848
But, um...

46:51.183 --> 46:52.768
I already have a supplier, so...

46:54.353 --> 46:58.065
Yeah, but you just took Eddie's territory.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.194
So I think you're gonna need a lot more.

47:02.945 --> 47:05.948
I seem to remember
you saying you were all about volume.

47:06.031 --> 47:10.202
Just think about how much more
you can make cutting mine.

47:12.412 --> 47:14.414
You can get more? Huh?

47:14.957 --> 47:17.626
Because, I mean, you look like a--

47:17.709 --> 47:20.337
Like a housewife covered in blood?

47:22.965 --> 47:27.469
I moved cocaine for ten years,
Medellín to New York.

47:27.553 --> 47:31.640
And you have no idea
what I have gone through since.

47:32.391 --> 47:35.310
So, to me... this is nothing.

47:36.979 --> 47:42.818
I'm going to be here every fucking night
until you tell me "yes."

47:46.947 --> 47:48.115
You have one shot.

47:50.659 --> 47:53.579
Double my order next month
and I'll make you my supplier.
