03:01.765 --> 03:06.271
Ah. Has everyone met our
new art teacher, Sheba Hart?

03:06.353 --> 03:10.199
I've asked Sheba to sit in
on this meeting. As you all know,

03:10.273 --> 03:15.200
I regard the arts as absolutely essential
to our policy of reform through nurture.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.872
Thank you, Chris.
Very good. Very good.

03:18.115 --> 03:21.494
Thank you, Sue. I say,
that's a big one, isn't it?

03:21.576 --> 03:24.705
I'll be up till the crack of dawn!

thoughts for its future development?

03:53.150 --> 03:55.824
You'll find it's quite thorough,

Have they gone for her?

05:42.801 --> 05:45.554
Torn her posters down.
There's a paint fight.

05:45.637 --> 05:49.938
They're chanting, "Get your tits out

(MAN) How was madam?

05:51.309 --> 05:54.279
Lost it. "Stop it,

05:54.604 --> 05:58.359
- You should have stepped in.
- He didn't want to patronise the lady.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.320
This time next year
she'll be headmistress.

- Milk, no sugar.
- Sweet enough?

06:12.747 --> 06:16.468
- Evidently.
- Didn't her father invent inflation?

06:16.751 --> 06:19.300
- You what?
- Wasn't her dad that academic?

06:19.546 --> 06:24.347
Donald whatsit. Economics bloke.
Invented the word "inflation".

06:24.551 --> 06:26.929
Oh, yeah.
I know who you mean.

06:27.304 --> 06:30.399
I think you'll find that Mrs.
Hart's father was Ronald Taylor.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.942
He didn't invent inflation.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.613
He devised a theory about
the relationship between inflation

06:36.771 --> 06:38.694
and consumer expectation.

- Their motive was unclear.

Davis, I know. You're a little thug.
Who might you be?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.429
- Steven Connolly, Miss.
- What?

07:43.588 --> 07:45.386
- Steven Connolly, Miss.
- Year?

07:45.548 --> 07:48.472
- Year 10, Miss.
- You're the naked footballer.

07:49.386 --> 07:53.232
Why were you fighting?
It's a perfectly simple question.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.854
- Dunno, Miss.
- You don't know.

07:56.101 --> 08:00.072
One minute you're inert, the next
you're trying to castrate a pupil.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.031
Nothing occurred
between these two states?

08:02.107 --> 08:03.199
No.

08:03.274 --> 08:06.494
Don't play the hero with me,
Connolly. Yes?

08:06.569 --> 08:09.573
Brain, mouth, speak.

08:11.366 --> 08:15.246
He was saying stuff about Miss.
It was bang out of order.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.295
- What did you say?
- I never said nothing, Miss.

08:19.541 --> 08:23.466
"I didn't say anything."
What did he say? Come on!

08:23.753 --> 08:26.927
He said she's a tart. He said he
gave her one up the arse.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.138
Did you, indeed?

08:29.384 --> 08:31.762
Odious boy. Apologise at once.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.482
- Sorry, Miss.

<i>Her trendy politics

09:17.891 --> 09:21.236
We serve them best if we teach
them to read, write and add.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.814
They don't need to know
about basket weavers.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.696
- Barbara's keen on the basics.
- When you started,

09:26.775 --> 09:29.369
didn't you want to give them
a real education

09:29.444 --> 09:33.790
to help them overcome
the poverty of their backgrounds?

09:33.865 --> 09:38.746
Oh, yes, of course. But one soon
learns that teaching is crowd control.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.377
Come here.
You know you're not supposed...

09:41.456 --> 09:46.508
We're a branch of the social services.
Put that back, you.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.599
Console yourself with the gems.

09:51.674 --> 09:55.099
That's when it's satisfying.
You can make a real difference.

09:55.178 --> 09:58.682
The rest is just
cattle-prod and pray.

<i>I wonder if she possesses
the requisite heft?</i>

10:09.234 --> 10:11.657

- Yeah.

10:13.863 --> 10:14.464

That's the year 11s.
They're a nightmare.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.874
Do you want to join us?
We're going for a quick coffee.

10:21.037 --> 10:25.417
- I've got a bit of an announcement.
- You're leaving St George's?

10:25.500 --> 10:26.968
No.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.880
Oh, you're pregnant.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.805
That's fantastic.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.305
Oh, congratulations.
When are you due?

10:38.388 --> 10:41.437
- June 7.
- A summer baby. How lovely.

10:41.516 --> 10:44.611
I can't believe nobody's noticed.
I'm 14 weeks.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.563
Didn't you see how
chunky I'm getting?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.990
Didn't like to say.
Where are you having it?

10:49.065 --> 10:52.820
(SUE) Homerton.
It's really nice there.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.030
Lovely, friendly nurses.

10:55.113 --> 10:58.037
I'm going to find out at the next scan.
20 weeks.

11:00.535 --> 11:04.961
- Do you want to come to lunch on Sunday?
- Where?

11:05.039 --> 11:08.384
To mine. To our house.

11:08.459 --> 11:12.839
- Won't you be with the family?
- Oh, yes, but you're very welcome.

11:12.922 --> 11:17.268
It's no big deal.
I'll just do a lasagne or something.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.471
I adore lasagne.

<i>Lasagne tends to disagree with my bowels.</i>

11:45.622 --> 11:48.216

No, you're bang on. I'm Richard.
Come in.

apricot brandy knocking around.

- A dry white wine?
- Done.

Later, in town.

13:25.847 --> 13:30.648

- Mum inherited it. It's her little joke.

I only married her for the property.

- Mm.

Mm.
Are you interested in wine?

- Is that when you're grown up?
- No. He's been cast in his school play.

I greatly look forward to Benjamin Hart

(SHEBA) Mm.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.366
It was.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.245
Oh, I love these.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.710
Such vibrant colours.

16:36.736 --> 16:39.570
Take one. Take two.
Have the lot, actually.

16:39.624 --> 16:44.346
- I couldn't possibly.
- Honestly, no one else wants them.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.390
I'll treasure them.

16:47.465 --> 16:51.561
It must be exhausting, running
a family and teaching as well.

16:51.636 --> 16:55.061
Oh, I can't wait for
term to end.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.769
Roll on Christmas and
a month of sod all.

17:02.313 --> 17:06.113
I shouldn't have kidded
myself I could teach.

17:06.817 --> 17:10.946
It's just that I've spent the
last ten years looking after Ben

17:11.030 --> 17:13.874
and I was so desperate
to get out and do something,

17:13.950 --> 17:19.127
and finally we get him into this great
local school and I'm free to work and...

17:20.080 --> 17:24.382
- You're gonna be a terrific teacher.
- Thanks.

17:24.961 --> 17:28.966
But I'm bloody hopeless,
and everyone knows it.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.138
Children are feral.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.144
Don't let them sense
your anxiety.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.851
- How do you cope?
- Oh, I'm just a battle-axe.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.979
I'm not popular,
but they respect me.

17:43.396 --> 17:48.277
Well, you're popular with me. It's
strange. I feel like I can talk to you.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.283
<i>She spoke of her vile mother,</i>

17:52.154 --> 17:55.704
<i>her grief over the
death of her father,</i>

17:55.992 --> 17:58.996
<i>the glory days when
Richard scooped her up</i>

17:59.161 --> 18:05.168
<i>and then jettisoned wife and children
for what she called a nonstop fuckfest.</i>

18:06.168 --> 18:12.346
<i>It's a peculiar trait of the privileged,
immediate incautious intimacy.</i>

18:12.967 --> 18:17.063
<i>But Sheba went well beyond
the tendencies of her class.</i>

18:18.014 --> 18:20.688
<i>She was utterly candid,</i>

18:21.726 --> 18:25.026
<i>a novice confessing to
the mother superior.</i>

18:25.855 --> 18:30.076
You know, marriage and kids,
I mean, it's wonderful,

18:30.151 --> 18:33.405
but it doesn't give you meaning.

18:33.654 --> 18:37.284
It gives you an imperative
but it doesn't help you...

18:37.366 --> 18:42.213
My father always used to say,
you know, on the tube, "Mind the gap."

18:45.458 --> 18:51.090
I don't know. It's just the distance
between life as you dream it

18:51.172 --> 18:53.266
and

18:54.717 --> 18:56.936
life as it is.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.145
I know exactly what you mean.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.034
A gold-star day.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.576
<i>I always knew we'd be friends.</i>

19:16.947 --> 19:19.041
<i>Our mutual reserve inhibited us,</i>

19:19.116 --> 19:23.792
<i>but now it is manifest,
a spiritual recognition.</i>

19:25.164 --> 19:27.917
(HEADMASTER) Many of you
will enjoy Christmas.

19:28.084 --> 19:31.088
<i>S and I share the ability</i>

19:31.253 --> 19:35.975
<i>to see through the quotidian
awfulness of things.</i>

19:37.885 --> 19:40.764
<i>In a different, better age,</i>

19:40.846 --> 19:43.941
<i>we would be ladies of leisure,
lunching together,</i>

19:44.016 --> 19:46.690
<i>visiting galleries, travelling,</i>

19:46.769 --> 19:49.067
<i>putting the world to rights.</i>

19:49.146 --> 19:52.946
<i>We would be companions.</i>

19:59.323 --> 20:02.998
<i>Christ by highest heaven adored</i>

20:03.077 --> 20:06.547
<i>Christ the everlasting Lord</i>

20:06.622 --> 20:09.592
<i>Late in time behold him come</i>

20:09.667 --> 20:12.921
<i>Offspring of a virgin's womb</i>

20:13.003 --> 20:16.223
It's taken.
I'm saving it for Sheba.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.466
Sorry.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.644
<i>Hail the incarnate Deity</i>

20:20.219 --> 20:22.847
<i>Pleased as man with man to dwell</i>

Very good.
Well done.

(PHONE RINGS)

22:44.280 --> 22:46.453
Ben, pop it in the car,
sweetheart. Hello?

22:47.032 --> 22:49.751
I need to speak to you
about Steven Connolly.

22:51.287 --> 22:54.040
- Who?
- Let's not, shall we?

22:54.456 --> 22:58.256
<i>Doubtless you're aware
you've committed a criminal of fence.</i>

22:58.586 --> 23:00.964
<i>I'll be with you at five.</i>

23:05.426 --> 23:07.053
Let's go to the pub, OK?

23:10.264 --> 23:12.858
When will you tell them?

23:13.100 --> 23:15.478
I need to know the circumstances.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.147
You must inform me of everything.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.407
Actually, you were there
when I first saw him.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.206
<i>I think you gave him a telling off.</i>

23:27.489 --> 23:30.333
(BARBARA)
<i>I gave him a slight ticking off.</i>

23:30.659 --> 23:33.162
<i>(SHEBA)
He dedicated his goal to me.</i>

23:33.621 --> 23:36.340
It amused me, nothing more.

23:37.625 --> 23:42.131
Then a few days later he
came to see me.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.783
Would you have a
look at me drawings?

23:44.809 --> 23:47.626
I'll look in class.
You do Art, don't you?

23:48.010 --> 23:50.934
I'm not allowed.
I'm special needs.

23:51.347 --> 23:54.100
I gotta do extra reading instead.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.853
Did you do these at home?

24:05.527 --> 24:07.950
These are good.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.332
You can draw.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.835
If we pull strings for one child
the whole system will unravel.

24:16.914 --> 24:20.259
But he's talented.
He's found something he believes in.

24:20.334 --> 24:22.462
Well, they're all talented.

24:23.212 --> 24:26.432
You found your gem,
as Sue would say.

24:26.507 --> 24:31.354
I said that I would teach him after
school, but only if he felt like it.

24:31.428 --> 24:35.478
- It's our job, isn't it?
- Within specified hours and curriculum.

24:35.557 --> 24:39.312
Barbara, he came every
day for two weeks.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.490
Yes, I was flattered,
but more than that.

24:43.565 --> 24:47.069
<i>I was excited to find someone
who wanted to learn.</i>

24:47.152 --> 24:53.376
And he imagined this sort of helicopter
500 years ago. it does your brain in.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.795
<i>(BARBARA) But surely you must have
suspected his motives?</i>

24:56.870 --> 25:01.717
I sensed he had a little crush
on me, but so what?

25:01.792 --> 25:03.886
It was innocent.

25:03.961 --> 25:07.215
That's so much better.
You've absolutely got that knuckle.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.391
Nailed it.

25:11.176 --> 25:15.431
- Do that again, Miss.
- Don't be silly. Off you go.

25:16.807 --> 25:21.404
- What are you having for tea, Miss?
- Probably buy something on the way home.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.572
- Are you a good cook?
- Not really.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.741
You suck?

25:29.361 --> 25:31.989
Go home, Steven.

25:42.291 --> 25:45.716
- That's when you should have stopped it.
- I did.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.967
I told him I wouldn't
teach him any more.

25:48.047 --> 25:51.176
But he refused to accept it.
He just kept coming back.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.563
Miss!

25:57.389 --> 25:59.733
<i>(SHEBA) It began to feel
like our secret,</i>

25:59.808 --> 26:04.609
<i>and secrets can be seductive.</i>

26:15.324 --> 26:19.170
- D'you wanna come for a walk?
- Absolutely not.

26:19.787 --> 26:23.041
I'm going home to my family.
As should you.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.171
Miss!

26:28.337 --> 26:32.558
My dad's got the sack.
He's been taking it out on me.

26:32.633 --> 26:36.638
<i>(SHEBA) His father hit him. He didn't
tell his mum because she was ill.</i>

26:36.720 --> 26:40.770
<i>- Does your mother know?
- Kidney disease.</i>

26:40.849 --> 26:44.774
- It's taking months for an operation.
- He was so vulnerable.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.652
If he does it again, you tell me.

26:47.898 --> 26:50.071
Thanks, Miss.

26:51.068 --> 26:53.116
You're beautiful, Miss.

26:53.195 --> 26:54.947
You don't know how
beautiful you are.

27:02.204 --> 27:06.254
<i>(SHEBA) I hadn't been pursued
like this for years.</i>

27:06.333 --> 27:11.214
<i>I knew it was wrong and immoral
and completely ridiculous,</i>

27:11.296 --> 27:14.015
but I don't know.

27:14.091 --> 27:16.640
I just allowed it to happen.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.766
The boy is 15!

27:21.306 --> 27:25.277
- But he's quite mature for his age.
- "But" is not a helpful word here.

27:26.854 --> 27:29.357
This is going to sound sick

27:30.774 --> 27:37.202
but something in me felt entitled. You
know, I've been good all my adult life.

27:37.281 --> 27:41.787
I've been a decent wife,
dutiful mother, coping with Ben.

27:42.536 --> 27:46.666
<i>This voice inside me kept saying,
"Why shouldn't you be bad?</i>

27:46.748 --> 27:50.969
<i>"You know, why shouldn't you transgress?
You've earned the right."</i>

27:51.044 --> 27:52.546
I said get out, Denzel.

27:52.629 --> 27:57.055
The rest of you get on
with your work, please.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.432
Hurry up.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.108
(BEN LAUGHS)

28:26.622 --> 28:29.876
Sue phoned.
OK if I meet her for a drink?

28:30.751 --> 28:33.675
Sure.
I'll put bug-a-lugs to bed.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.321
Evening, Miss.

29:21.343 --> 29:23.641
Make yourself comfortable.

29:23.720 --> 29:27.816
It's incredibly important
we keep this secret.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.981
- Does anyone know you're here?
- No.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.487
Miss.

29:40.570 --> 29:43.540
I'm no genius,
but I ain't a dickhead.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.206
I won't tell no one.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.788
You can trust me.

29:51.581 --> 29:54.801
We'd both get into
terrible trouble.

30:19.192 --> 30:22.492
It was easy,
like having another drink

30:22.571 --> 30:25.450
when you know you shouldn't.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.830
Can I smoke, Miss?

30:31.079 --> 30:35.425
You can do what you want,
but enough of this "Miss".

30:45.344 --> 30:47.767
Were you a model once?

30:49.348 --> 30:52.477
Well, you should have been.
You're well fit.

30:52.893 --> 30:55.021
Gosh, but don't I know it.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.526
You're into The Streets?

30:58.106 --> 31:00.359
Well, my daughter is.

31:01.485 --> 31:04.284
Is she the same age as me?

31:04.488 --> 31:06.661
None of your beeswax.

31:11.453 --> 31:14.798
Well, anyway,
the point is you're fit.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.545
Well, so are you.

31:19.795 --> 31:25.177
You reckon? My sister thinks
I look like a bollock with measles.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.479
You've done my brain in.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.638
- You wanna do it again?
- (LAUGHS)

32:04.172 --> 32:06.015
What?

32:08.218 --> 32:10.186
Yes.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.057
I wanna do it again.

32:16.685 --> 32:19.029
I wanna do it again.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.942
The day we met,

32:23.775 --> 32:25.322
it had already begun?

32:27.362 --> 32:28.909
Yes.

32:28.989 --> 32:31.492
Deputy head in the morning.

32:31.575 --> 32:35.751
Noble sentiment, Connolly.
Next time, words, not fists.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.957
Get inside, both of you.

32:38.039 --> 32:44.513
- And you had further relations that day?
- We went to the art room.

32:44.588 --> 32:48.218
Well, I'm glad I was such an aphrodisiac.
I was trying to help you.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.349
You did. I'm incredibly grateful.

32:51.428 --> 32:54.227
You've been such a good friend.

32:55.724 --> 32:58.193
Not reciprocated, it seems.

33:01.938 --> 33:05.067
I desperately wanted
to confess to you.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.910
But how could I?

33:08.778 --> 33:10.280
Barbara?

33:10.572 --> 33:14.076
It would have put you
in an impossible situation.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.706
I so wish I had.

33:18.914 --> 33:21.713
You would have made me see sense.

33:22.042 --> 33:25.592
<i>(BARBARA) And then I realised
my fury had blinded me.</i>

33:26.421 --> 33:29.925
<i>There was a magnificent
opportunity here.</i>

33:30.258 --> 33:33.353
<i>Can we go inside?
I'm absolutely freezing.</i>

33:36.431 --> 33:41.028
<i>With stealth, I might secure
the prize long term,</i>

33:41.102 --> 33:44.231
<i>forever in my debt.</i>

33:44.689 --> 33:47.943
<i>I could gain everything</i>

33:48.318 --> 33:50.412
<i>by doing nothing.</i>

33:52.864 --> 33:54.958
Look...

33:56.535 --> 34:01.416
I know you have to tell them.
You know, the head, the school.

34:01.790 --> 34:05.044
All I ask is that you wait
till the New Year.

34:06.169 --> 34:10.424
I'm begging you. Please let me have
this Christmas with my family.

34:10.632 --> 34:13.931
Oh, you poor thing.

34:14.969 --> 34:17.143
You've got yourself into a state?

34:18.598 --> 34:20.565
I'm not going to report you.

34:21.434 --> 34:25.484
I want to help you,
to support you through this.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.079
You're not going to tell?

34:35.364 --> 34:37.833
- You won't tell anyone?
- Who would it benefit?

34:37.993 --> 34:41.418
Not you or the boy,
and certainly not the school.

34:42.038 --> 34:44.291
No, this is a private matter,

34:45.125 --> 34:48.049
and we must keep it so.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.929
Yes.

34:56.386 --> 34:58.514
- Maybe I should resign.
- Oh, no.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.691
No, that might alert suspicion.

35:00.765 --> 35:06.067
No, you must stay at the school,
but the affair must end.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.657
Your solemn promise.

35:10.859 --> 35:13.328
I can't help you if
you don't promise.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.448
I promise.

35:19.367 --> 35:22.337
So you'll tell him straight
after Christmas?

35:22.412 --> 35:25.086
- It's all for the best.
- I know.

35:25.165 --> 35:29.261
Thank you so much.
You've been so brilliant.

35:29.336 --> 35:32.089
And you'll tell me
when it's done?

35:36.593 --> 35:39.142
Oh! You never said.

35:39.429 --> 35:42.182
- (BARBARA) Standard issue for spinsters.
- (LAUGHS)

35:42.849 --> 35:45.477
She's been off her food.
I'm worried about her.

35:45.560 --> 35:49.235

<i>Now more than ever,</i>

54:42.571 --> 54:45.871
<i>we are bound by the
secrets we share.</i>

54:48.035 --> 54:54.543
<i>I'm invited to drop in on them this
summer at their house in the Dordogne.</i>

54:56.168 --> 54:58.421
<i>I might just do that.</i>

55:05.469 --> 55:09.064
I once sat here discussing
Elgar for three hours.

55:09.139 --> 55:12.268
- God, who with?
- Oh, just a friend.

55:12.351 --> 55:15.981
Jennifer.
This was our haunt.

55:19.608 --> 55:23.488
We were quite chummy for
a while, but poor thing,

55:23.570 --> 55:27.825
- she suffered from a terrible depression.
- Oh.

55:27.908 --> 55:31.788
I tried to help,
but she rather unravelled.

55:31.870 --> 55:34.623
She became alarmingly deluded.

55:34.706 --> 55:37.300
Did she go to hospital?

55:37.376 --> 55:38.923
No.

55:39.002 --> 55:41.096
No, she got a job in Stoke.

55:42.256 --> 55:44.350
- When was this?
- Last summer.

55:44.424 --> 55:49.851
- But I feel I should have done more.
- I'm sure she knows you did your best.

55:49.930 --> 55:52.024
Such a sensitive person.

55:52.683 --> 55:55.061
One conceals it, of course.

56:00.482 --> 56:06.535
People languish for years with partners
who are clearly from another planet.

56:06.613 --> 56:11.460
We want so much to believe
that we've found our other.

56:12.661 --> 56:18.634
It takes courage to recognise the real
as opposed to the convenient.

56:20.544 --> 56:25.050
When I was young I had
such a vision of myself.

56:25.132 --> 56:31.139
I dreamed I'd be someone to be
reckoned with, you know, in the world.

56:31.221 --> 56:33.644
But one learns one's scale.

56:38.437 --> 56:41.782
I've such a dread of
ending my days alone.

56:41.857 --> 56:44.451
Yes. I... We all do.

56:44.526 --> 56:49.373
But recently I've allowed myself
to think that I may not be.

56:53.994 --> 56:56.292
Am I wrong?

56:59.291 --> 57:01.714
No.

57:14.973 --> 57:17.317
- (VET) Do you want to stay?
- (SOBS)

57:17.392 --> 57:22.614
Sometimes people find it comforting
to see them at peace.

57:22.689 --> 57:27.536
Would you like to come back
in 20 minutes to say goodbye?

57:35.786 --> 57:39.461
- (SHEBA) Have you got your seat belt on?
- (RICHARD) Oh, no. What the fuck?

57:39.539 --> 57:42.918
- (POLLY) Oh, God, not her!
- Shut up. I won't be a minute.

57:43.001 --> 57:48.553
- (POLLY) Mum, don't get out of the car!
- Is it Portia? Oh, no.

57:49.716 --> 57:52.686
I've got to go back
to the vet's after it's done.

57:52.761 --> 57:55.184
Will you come with me?
I can't on my own.

57:55.389 --> 57:59.895
Of course I would. It's just that
Ben's doing his play at his school...

57:59.977 --> 58:02.821
- Play?
- We're all going. We're late, actually.

58:02.896 --> 58:06.196
- Someone has died!
- I... I know.

58:07.067 --> 58:10.742
- And it's terribly sad.
- You owe me this!

58:10.821 --> 58:13.870
Ben, can't you make her vanish?
Use your wand.

58:13.949 --> 58:17.374
He's doing a show for
the first time in his life.

58:17.452 --> 58:20.080
- That's your choice, is it?
- (CAR HORN)

58:21.081 --> 58:22.799
Why don't you come?

58:23.166 --> 58:25.339
I thought you understood
what friendship means.

58:26.086 --> 58:28.464
He's my child. He's my son.

58:29.423 --> 58:32.677
- He's just a little boy.
- Don't play the good mother with me.

58:32.926 --> 58:36.180
Could you tell me what's going on?
Is this some kind of coven?

58:36.263 --> 58:37.685
I can explain perfectly.

58:37.764 --> 58:39.983
Barbara's had some bad
news about her cat.

58:40.225 --> 58:43.695
My condolences. Poor pussy.
Now, can I have my wife back, please?

58:43.770 --> 58:46.193
- I don't like your tone.
- Why is she here?

58:46.273 --> 58:49.243
What kind of fucking spell
has she cast on you?

58:49.317 --> 58:53.823
- Ben is getting stressed. He's gonna blow!
- Oh, for God's sake. Get in the car!

58:53.905 --> 58:56.954
Give me a minute, will you?
I can handle this.

58:57.034 --> 58:59.378
I'm to be handled, am I?
Like toxic waste?

58:59.453 --> 59:03.879
You see me on sufferance.
I'm an imposition to be tolerated.

59:03.957 --> 59:08.428
No, of course not. I love our time
together. I'm your good, good friend.

59:08.503 --> 59:10.096
- Then stay with me.
- (HORN)

59:10.172 --> 59:11.248
I would if I could.

59:11.274 --> 59:15.124
I'm desperately sorry about Portia,
but you can see, I have to go.

59:15.177 --> 59:19.057
Think very carefully, madam.
Be aware of the consequences.

59:19.139 --> 59:21.393
Don't make this mean
any more than it is.

59:21.419 --> 59:22.384
Stay with me.

59:22.434 --> 59:23.606
(HORN)

59:24.019 --> 59:26.442
- I don't know what I'll do.
- (POLLY) Let's go!

59:26.521 --> 59:30.071
- Look, I'll call you, I promise.
- (POLLY) Come on!

59:34.780 --> 59:37.033
<i>They always let you
down in the end.</i>

59:37.699 --> 59:40.293
<i>Jennifer said I was too intense.</i>

59:40.368 --> 59:42.496
<i>Meaning what, exactly?</i>

59:42.579 --> 59:46.254
<i>That I am loyal in my friendships?</i>

59:46.333 --> 59:49.678
<i>That I will go to the ends of
the earth for someone I admire?</i>

59:49.920 --> 59:52.173
- Shazam!
- (APPLAUSE)

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:04.810
(DOORBELL)

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:19.916
Not disturbing you, am I?

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:24.371
It's just...

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.999
I need to talk to you
about Mrs. Hart.

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:31.795
- Sheba.
- Ah.

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:34.552
It's a bit delicate.

01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:36.049
Can I come in?

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:52.073
- Tea?
- Oh, lovely, thanks.

01:00:56.444 --> 01:00:59.072
You haven't got a biscuit?

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.422
Cheers.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:13.678
- Would you like me to take your hat?
- Ah. Been up the Lane.

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:16.131
White Hart Lane,
home of the mighty Spurs.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:19.593
- Were you victorious?
- Three-nil. Jermain Defoe. Get in there!

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:26.271
My father was a supporter
of Charlton Athletic.

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.895
Never seemed to give
him any pleasure.

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:31.772
Where's the moggy?

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:34.069
She's dead.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:37.615
Oh, dear.

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:41.532
Oh, my condolences. Aw.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.620
Oh, is this not a good time?

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.165
It's a very good time.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:03.846
- Mrs. Hart.
- Yeah.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.765
It's just...

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:10.102
Anything you tell me
will be in strictest confidence.

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:16.074
Well, the thing is,
I was wondering if she's

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:20.286
ever mentioned me.

01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:23.790
Does she ever mention me?

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:28.500
Let me think.
No, never.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:30.964
Actually, yes.

01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:34.710
She mentioned you had invested
in a new shirt last term.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:37.341
Splashed out at Nicole Farhi.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:44.478
Thing is, over the last few months... Well,
ever since I met her, really, I've...

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:48.436
Brian, are you in love?

01:02:49.975 --> 01:02:52.244
I've been a bit bloody
obvious, haven't I?

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:54.221
You've been utterly
clandestine.

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:58.867
- So she mentioned the shirt?
- You do know she's married?

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:02.363
Yeah, but she's quite flirty, and you
never know with people, do you?

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:05.741
- Indeed you don't.
- But...

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:09.707
I wouldn't wanna make a move
if I'm just gonna get knocked back.

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:14.501
What with staff politics and the head being
such a stickler, you have to be careful.

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:16.255
It's a minefield.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.720
So would...

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:23.634
I mean, do you think you
could have a word with her

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:27.353
and just suss the lie of the land?

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:35.438
You'd like me to ask Mrs. Hart if she's
inclined to commit adultery with you?

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:43.620
I don't want you to suffer more
than is necessary. No one should.

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:49.748
I couldn't possibly speak for
Mrs. Hart, but instinct tells me

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:51.624
you might not be her type.

01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:56.166
She's got a type, then?

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:59.753
Oh, it's no reflection
on your attractiveness.

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:06.393
But my impression is that her
preference is for the younger man.

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:11.556
Surprisingly young.

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:13.604
Boys, I'm told.

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:18.192
Naturally, she doesn't discuss
any of this with me.

01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:21.942
But I've been hearing some rather
alarming rumours about one in particular.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:27.080
Playground gossip, staff
room whispers and so on.

01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:32.961
You might know the boy in question.

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:38.049
Steven Connolly.

01:04:39.584 --> 01:04:41.006
Year 10?

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:46.057
I think the kettle's boiled.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:50.228
<i>You say the words and it's done.</i>

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.351
<i>Easy.</i>

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:59.230
<i>Judas had the grace to
hang himself,</i>

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:04.409
<i>but only according to Matthew,
the most sentimental of the apostles.</i>

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:09.828
<i>Is this the last night of
her old life?</i>

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:15.962
<i>I wonder how long
my messenger will take.</i>

<i>that the accidental brush

sorry about today.</i>

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:12.598

Actually, I write quite quickly.

It's the thinking that
takes an eternity.

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:31.117
But you're never satisfied. When you're
lecturing, you long for time to write,

01:06:31.362 --> 01:06:35.333
and when you've got it, you yearn
to be back with your students.

- (RICHARD) I'll have a slug.

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:02.623

known of the relationship.</i>

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:07.626
<i>This, however, is categorically
denied by the local authority.</i>

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:12.175
Had I known anything, I would
have informed you immediately.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:13.843
My loyalty is to the school.

01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:16.592
- Brian thinks you've known for months.
- Brian!

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:20.096
- Then there is Sue...
- Will you run through the entire staff?

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:23.929
If you knew and turned a blind eye,
you have enabled a crime.

01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:27.390
- I didn't, so I haven't.
- You're due for retirement next year.

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:30.727
I think it would benefit everyone
if you take it early.

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:40.949

your disaster. Why don't you resign?

01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:44.999

Now, tell me about your
friendship with Mrs. Hart.

01:10:48.619 --> 01:10:52.749
I think you'll find a close friendship
between consenting adults is legal,

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:54.926
even under your regime.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:11:00.015
My record is beyond reproach. The majority
of the staff regard me as a moral guardian.

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:06.062
I've just spoken to an ex-member of our
staff, another of your "close" friends.

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:16.239

That's why she had to leave the school.

01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:19.158
Jennifer threatened you
with a restraining order.

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:21.361
That's nonsense.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:29.002
A fax from her solicitor. She didn't
want you within 500 yards of her by law!

01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:30.794
You call that a friendship?

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:35.045
She told me that you sent her
fiancé a wreath!

01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:42.136
Now, we wouldn't want all this
to come out, would we?

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:47.312

ending in shame and humiliation?
