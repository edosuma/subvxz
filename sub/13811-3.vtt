{\an8}Sorry I'm late, guys.

01:09.068 --> 01:11.654
{\an8}We had three kinds of pancakes
this morning.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.448
{\an8}It took me forever to decide.

01:13.531 --> 01:14.783
{\an8}It's okay, Twist.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.076
{\an7}We had Sammy here
to hold your place.

01:17.160 --> 01:17.827
{\an8}And that's all I'm doing.

01:17.911 --> 01:18.995

{\an8}I couldn't

02:03.331 --> 02:04.332

02:12.549 --> 02:13.883
Relax, Twist, man.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.718
I'm sure Sammy's got it.

02:18.930 --> 02:19.848
{\an1}Squid!

02:19.931 --> 02:20.557
Did you see where hat went?

02:20.640 --> 02:21.808
You lost your hat?

02:21.891 --> 02:24.310
Oh, I didn't notice.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.312
I was kind of busy
getting something.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.023

02:45.164 --> 02:47.584
I can't believe it's gone.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.835

02:48.918 --> 02:52.171
I hope your new buddy here
likes Shack burgers.

New buddy?

02:52.797 --> 02:55.592
It's me Twister.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.135
Twist?

02:57.218 --> 02:59.929
{\an5}Whoa, didn't
even recognize you
without your hat on.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.682
Oh, this is the lamest.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.101
Twist, you can always
get a new hat.

03:05.184 --> 03:08.563
You don't understand,
I need <i> my</i> hat.

03:08.646 --> 03:10.690

<i>my mom gave it to me</i>

03:23.244 --> 03:24.120
Oh, what?

03:24.203 --> 03:25.747
I didn't do nothing.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.123
<i>And at family parties</i>

03:32.378 --> 03:35.298
<i>Ay, mira que lindo sobrino.</i>

03:35.381 --> 03:36.758
I knew I saw that hat.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.344
Come here, come here.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.345
Look at him.

03:40.428 --> 03:41.638
Come, say hello

03:41.721 --> 03:43.014
to your uncle.

03:43.097 --> 03:44.599
Ay, Twister,
mwah, mwah.

03:44.682 --> 03:45.808
(<i> speaking Spanish</i> )

03:45.892 --> 03:46.976
I like your hat.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.019
{\an3}Lars!

03:48.102 --> 03:50.480
Oh, what, I didn't
do nothing.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.816
I've always had that hat.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.194
And everyone's always
known I'm Twister.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.905
Man, I got to find it!

04:00.156 --> 04:03.159
I never knew that old hat
meant so much to him.

04:03.242 --> 04:06.663
Wow, I've never seen someone
get so freaked out

04:06.746 --> 04:08.247
about losing a hat.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.999
Whoa!

04:10.083 --> 04:10.833
(<i> sighs relief</i> )

04:10.917 --> 04:13.169
(<i> chuckles</i> )

04:19.884 --> 04:20.802
You guys ready?

04:20.885 --> 04:23.680
I'm sticking it
this time for sure.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.104
Whoa. Ooh.

04:31.187 --> 04:34.691
{\an1}I'd calculate that
at around 865.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.609
865?

04:36.693 --> 04:38.820
Sam, I'm going for a 900.

04:38.903 --> 04:42.031
If you're going for 900 biffs
I think you made it.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.575
Man, where's Twister?

04:44.659 --> 04:46.327
I haven't seen him all day.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.328
Hey, guys.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.332
"I keep it real."

04:51.416 --> 04:52.542
Cool hat, Twist.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.960
{\an3}Thanks.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.295
I'm just wearing it till
I find my regular hat.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.047
And check these out.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.716
"Lost..."

04:59.799 --> 05:02.218
{\an1}"If you find it
give it back to me"?

05:02.301 --> 05:03.219
Pretty sweet, huh?

05:03.302 --> 05:04.053
I put them all over the pier

05:04.137 --> 05:06.723
and I'm going
to comb MadTown.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.891
{\an1}But even if someone
does find it

05:08.975 --> 05:12.228
{\an1}how are they going to
know who it belongs to?

05:24.490 --> 05:26.367
Hey, watch out, man.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.753
What's the deal?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.129
{\an3}Hey, dork,

05:38.212 --> 05:39.756
why don't you go litter
somewhere else?

05:39.839 --> 05:41.591
I'm not a dork.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.885
Hey, there, new guy,
my town welcomes you,

05:43.968 --> 05:45.094
{\an1}but you got to skate if you
want to hang around here.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.722
Conroy, it's me, Twister.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.349
Twister?

05:50.433 --> 05:51.392
Sorry, man

05:51.476 --> 05:52.894
I didn't recognize you

05:52.977 --> 05:53.770
without your normal lid on.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.314
Oh, man.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.232
I'm going for a surf.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.570
Come on, guys, we got
to cheer up, Twist.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.204
Raymundo didn't recognize me.

06:11.287 --> 06:12.997
Conroy didn't know who I was.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.249
Everyone at MadTown
thought I was lame.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.085
Without my hat, I'm not...

06:17.168 --> 06:19.962
I'm not even Twister anymore.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.255
No way, bro.

06:21.339 --> 06:21.798
You'll always
be Twister.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.092
Yeah, Twist

06:24.175 --> 06:25.510
your hat has nothing to do
with who you are.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.015
Whoa. Whoa.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.227
Man, I can't see.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.271
Whoa.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.232
Get off my wave, bro.

06:39.565 --> 06:39.941
Aah!

06:40.024 --> 06:41.818
Whoa.

06:41.901 --> 06:42.819
(<i> screams</i> )

06:42.902 --> 06:45.905
Hey, watch where
you're surfing, man.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.657
Lars, it's me.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.826
Twister?

06:49.909 --> 06:52.537
Man, I can't believe
I'm related to you.

06:54.622 --> 06:58.459
My own brother didn't
even know who I was.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.294
At least that's
one good thing.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.005
You guys may as well
call me Maurice.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.591
When that hat flew away,
so did Twister.

07:15.059 --> 07:16.686
<i>Hey, cousins</i>

07:16.769 --> 07:20.189
looks like you're
one banana shy of a bunch.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.858
Yeah, you seen
Twister anywhere?

07:21.941 --> 07:23.693
We were supposed
to meet him here.

07:23.776 --> 07:24.485
No.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.028
I haven't seen him all day.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.364
I'm right here!

07:28.447 --> 07:29.657
Oh, sorry, little cuz

07:29.740 --> 07:32.702
didn't even know it was
you without your...

07:32.785 --> 07:34.579
without your, uh...

07:34.662 --> 07:36.998
face wrapped around
a double banana split.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.082
No, thanks.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.751
Banana splits were
Twister's favorite food.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.588
Give me a refried fish burger.

07:43.671 --> 07:44.881
{\an6}Huh?

07:43.671 --> 07:44.881
{\an4}Huh?

07:43.671 --> 07:44.881
Huh?

07:43.671 --> 07:44.881
Huh?

07:44.964 --> 07:46.215
{\an5}I thought I was
the only one who
liked those.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.552
Yeah, bro, you hate fish.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.721
No, Twister hated fish.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.472
Maybe Maurice likes it.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.517
Twist, that's the lamest thing
I've ever heard.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.186
Let's just skip the grub.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.645
I know what'll
cheer you up.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.147
How about a phat bike ride

08:01.230 --> 08:02.899
to the other side
of Ocean Shores?

08:02.982 --> 08:04.400
No, thanks.

08:04.483 --> 08:08.696
Twister rode bikes, not me.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.240
All right, that's it.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.325
Maurice has got to go.

08:12.408 --> 08:15.244
{\an1}It's time to get
Twister back.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.705
Guys, we've got to find
that hat.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.093
Here you go, kids.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.346
Lost and found.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.514
I'm sure it's
here, Twist.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.517
Oh, it's not in there.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.020
Boy, I'm sure going
to miss being Twister.

08:41.102 --> 08:42.355
We're not
giving up, Twist.

08:42.438 --> 08:42.938
There's a
thousand places

08:43.022 --> 08:45.274
your hat can be.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.486
(<i> screaming</i> )

08:49.362 --> 08:50.613
Hmm.

08:50.696 --> 08:54.617
You know, if we tossed a hat
off the roller coaster

08:54.700 --> 08:56.953
right at the point
where yours flew off

08:57.036 --> 08:58.913
there's a chance
it might lead us

08:58.996 --> 09:00.289
straight to your hat.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.709
That's a great idea.

09:03.793 --> 09:04.627
Cool.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.295
Here, Twist,
get on the ride.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.255
Toss this off.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.466
And I'll chase
after it.

09:10.549 --> 09:13.219
You better hand me
a few more hats.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.599
I sort of forgot
where exactly it flew off.

09:26.565 --> 09:29.318
I don't see why I have to be
the one on the ride.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.779
{\an1}Sam, we all know
you're the slow...

09:31.862 --> 09:35.199

to be hat tosser.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.620
(<i> gulps</i> )

09:39.704 --> 09:43.332
I just hope the only thing
I toss are these hats.

09:44.834 --> 09:48.004
Oh, honey, leave that
old smelly hat here.

any other hats lately?

Oh, well, I guess it's just
you and me from now on.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.168
Ooh!

11:10.211 --> 11:11.754
My hat!

11:14.757 --> 11:18.886
So, uh, Twist, I see
you got your hat back.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.930
{\an5}(<i> nasal</i> ):
And we're glad to have
Twister back, too.

11:21.013 --> 11:25.559
But you think maybe
you should wash that hat?

11:27.395 --> 11:30.272
And take it off again? No way.

11:30.356 --> 11:34.693
Dude, I think I know the
perfect way to clean it.

{\an1}And, in the tradition

13:01.989 --> 13:04.158
{\an1}we signed you up
for the triathlon, too.

and everything is connected.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.028
Well, up at dawn as usual.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.529
Did my daily swim

15:47.613 --> 15:48.614
