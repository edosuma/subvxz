00:23.774 --> 00:26.442
AUGUSTEN: My name
is Augusten Burroughs.

00:27.611 --> 00:31.447
Where do I begin to tell the story
of how my mother left me,

00:31.532 --> 00:33.574
and then I left my mother?

00:34.702 --> 00:39.163
Maybe I should begin with the part about
how she'd keep me home from school.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.708
That's how close we were.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.209
I was so crazy about her.

00:43.293 --> 00:46.003
Oh, hello, Miss Mimm,
this is Deirdre Burroughs calling.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.839
Augusten won't be attending school today.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.716
I over-conditioned my hair.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.635
-He over-conditioned his hair.
-And the party.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.055
And he has to help me with the dinner party.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.557
Thank you.

01:03.105 --> 01:05.480
AUGUSTEN: My mother
was crazy about me too.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.942
I've always known that.

01:09.111 --> 01:11.779
I guess it doesn't matter where I begin,

01:11.822 --> 01:14.615
because nobody's gonna
believe me anyway.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.246
DEIRDRE: (WHISPERING) Augusten.

01:25.294 --> 01:27.545
Wake up. Wake up.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.047
Augusten. Wake up.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.009
I need you.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.807
Okay. Testing. Testing. Can you hear me?

01:48.692 --> 01:52.195
"Childhood is gone. What remains?

01:53.906 --> 01:58.451
"Childhood is gone. And youth.

01:58.744 --> 02:03.831
"And ties with people I have loved
are broken now.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.377
"My grief is more than I can easily contain.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.714
"My grief builds this town anew

02:11.757 --> 02:16.052
"and raises all the dead to walk with me
this day.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.722
"What's left?

02:19.807 --> 02:22.183
"My future seems nefarious,

02:22.226 --> 02:24.101

02:24.186 --> 02:25.978

02:31.568 --> 02:34.904
"Most of all, what I will miss

02:34.947 --> 02:38.658
"is the extravagance of my entire future

02:38.742 --> 02:42.411
"stretched out before me
like a highway in the desert.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.627
"I weep for what is gone.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.880
"And I weep for myself."

02:58.679 --> 03:01.973
Okay, now I need your honest reaction.
Did it feel powerful to you?

03:02.057 --> 03:03.933
Emotionally charged?

03:03.976 --> 03:07.937
Lt really does seem like something
you'd read in The New Yorker.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.107
You really think so?

03:11.149 --> 03:14.819
The New Yorker's very selective.
They don't publish just anyone.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.946
I really think they would publish this.

03:16.989 --> 03:20.157
That thing with your paralyzed sister,
that was great.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.827
Well, we'll see.

03:23.954 --> 03:27.540
I just got a rejection letter from
The Virginia Quarterly.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.001
That worries me.

03:30.586 --> 03:35.298
Of course, if The New Yorker did accept
this poem, your grandmother would see it.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.175
I can't imagine what she would say.

03:39.094 --> 03:43.431
But I can't let her reaction
keep me from publishing.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.517
Augusten,

03:47.978 --> 03:51.480
your mother was meant to be
a very famous woman.

04:10.751 --> 04:15.129
I have a reading. I have books to sign.
I told you to be here at 4:00. It's 4:30.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.384
-I got stuck in traffic.
-Bullshit. You're trying to sabotage me.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.320
Wanna play checkers, Dad?

04:39.863 --> 04:42.782
Not right now, son. My back is out,
I've got papers to grade and I'm very tired.

04:42.866 --> 04:46.410
So why don't you go outside and play
with the dog for a little while?

04:46.495 --> 04:49.830
But I'm sick of Cream.
All she wants to do is sleep.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.707
She's an old lady.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.597
Testing. One, two, three.

05:51.435 --> 05:54.687
Thank you for coming to my poetry
reading tonight.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.941
"Childhood is gone. What remains?

05:59.234 --> 06:01.610
"Childhood is gone. And youth."

DEIRDRE: "And ties with people I have loved
are broken now.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.529
Thank you.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.001
I don't understand.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.170
I polish my allowance.

07:01.213 --> 07:04.673
I boil it clean,
then polish it with silver polish.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.885
But why, Augusten? Why?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.429
Because I like shiny things.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.605
I really don't see myself in you at all.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.483
I'm more like my mom.

07:22.651 --> 07:25.528
I wanna be special and I wanna be famous.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.170
Are you going to a funeral?

07:44.256 --> 07:48.551
No. No, sweetie. It's a gown
for public appearances. You wanna cut?

07:50.846 --> 07:55.057
See, the plan is, I'm announced,
at some place grand and serious

07:55.100 --> 07:57.226
like Carnegie Hall.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.727
And I come out in this.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.730
And I stand in front of a black velvet curtain.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.483
I'm gonna demand that in my contract.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.987
And that way, everything fades away,
except my writing.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.697
The mail came.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.645
(SIGHING)

09:09.841 --> 09:12.301
"And when the sun comes out

09:12.344 --> 09:15.471
"the daffodil looks skyward.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.056

09:18.141 --> 09:19.850

09:20.560 --> 09:22.728
"Triumphant trumpet."

09:29.694 --> 09:31.445
Did you like it, Deirdre?

09:31.780 --> 09:35.574
I've been working on it
since the last meeting of the poetry club.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.952
You said, "Write what you know."

09:38.328 --> 09:41.455
I love to garden so I thought
I would write about dirt and the sun.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.123
It's shit, Fern.

09:45.794 --> 09:49.004
It's sentimental. It's emotionally dishonest.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.548
Lt implodes into nothingness. I was bored.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.720
Were you bored, Christy?

10:00.183 --> 10:02.434
Lt sort of didn't go anywhere.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.813
You didn't tap into your creative
unconscious, Fern.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.694
Honey.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.947
I'm sorry, Deirdre.

10:15.031 --> 10:18.367
I so wanted to have a creative outlet
and I thought maybe this was it.

10:18.451 --> 10:22.538
But you're right. It's terrible.

10:22.622 --> 10:27.960
If Anne Sexton writes about flowers, Fern,
the poem isn't about the goddamn flowers.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.964
The flowers would wilt and rot.

10:32.048 --> 10:36.093
She'd use metaphor to explore her
dead marriage, her pain. You understand?

10:38.054 --> 10:43.309
Sexton's therapist told her to write poetry
as a way to exorcize her rage.

10:43.393 --> 10:48.314
Now, she's not a housewife.
She's a rock 'n' roller. Okay?

10:48.940 --> 10:52.901
Last week in Boston, 2000 people waited
in a fucking blizzard to hear her read.

10:52.944 --> 10:56.280
That's power recovered.
So that's what you need to do, Fern.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.325
You need to recover
by expressing your anger.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.662
I am angry.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.708
-Steve takes me for granted.
-There it is again. Men.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.588
I'm so sorry.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.507
No, don't you dare apologize, Fern.

11:15.592 --> 11:20.095
You funnel that rage into the only escape
you have. Your art.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.980
Who wants to read next?

11:33.485 --> 11:35.235
Christy, you're hiding.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.280
I'm just not quite there.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.616
Get the rage on the page, women.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.957
-You infantile tyrant!
-Jesus.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.835
You'd like nothing more than to see me
slit my wrists!

11:51.920 --> 11:54.463
Why don't you just settle down?
You know, you are hysterical.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.382
You're so goddamn hysterical!

11:56.466 --> 11:58.592
-I'm hysterical? You think this is hysterical?
-Yes!

11:58.635 --> 12:01.762
You poor bastard!
You're so repressed that you...

12:01.805 --> 12:05.641
You mistake creative passion for hysteria!
Don't you see?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.351
This is how you're killing me.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.228
Nobody is trying to kill you, Deirdre.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.688
You're doing
a perfectly good job of it yourself.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.233
I wish you'd rot in hell.
I regret the day I ever married you.

12:14.317 --> 12:15.734
Will you two stop fighting?

12:15.819 --> 12:18.445
This is between me and your father!
Your father is the one...

12:18.488 --> 12:20.531
Well, I live here too, you know!

12:20.615 --> 12:24.159
Look at you. Look at your damn face.
You got the face of a man twice your age.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.994
Forty-five going on 90!

12:26.079 --> 12:27.663
Will you just shut up?

12:27.789 --> 12:29.832
(BOTH SCREAMING)

12:40.301 --> 12:41.927
He's not moving!

12:42.846 --> 12:46.473
No, he's just playing another one
of his horribly manipulative games.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.183
Get up, Norman!

12:53.690 --> 12:55.232
Get up, Norman.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.443
Enough of your pranks.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.970
Please don't kill her.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.097
He's not gonna kill me.

13:27.849 --> 13:31.101
He'd rather suffocate me with
his horribly oppressive manipulation

13:31.186 --> 13:33.937
and then wait for me to cut my own throat.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.948
Go to bed. Go to bed, Augusten.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.409
You've got school in the morning.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.745
I don't want to go to school.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.831
You've got to go, Augusten!

13:53.249 --> 13:56.168
You can't keep skipping or I'll get arrested.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.588
Why can't we just be a normal family?

14:39.170 --> 14:41.004
Oh, thank God.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.260
Hello there.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.638
Please come in.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.644
I've just been a frantic wreck
waiting for you to get here.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.354
It's okay now, Mrs. Burroughs.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.856
Oh, no, please. Call me Deirdre.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.067
Where's Norman, dear?

15:02.151 --> 15:04.444
Oh, he's passed out drunk.

15:04.487 --> 15:08.156
-I see.
-I was afraid for my life tonight.

15:09.200 --> 15:13.912
I thought for sure he was gonna kill me,
that this would finally be the night.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.665
Would you like a Sanka?

15:16.749 --> 15:20.961
I'd like some slices of bologna
with a side of horseradish.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.347
Do you mind, son?

15:38.021 --> 15:43.150
Don't you worry about your parents,
buckaroo. We'll get this all sorted out.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.901
Good luck.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.695
I just pray to God Norman doesn't snap.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.530
One of these days he's gonna snap
and kill us all.

15:48.573 --> 15:49.615
Enough!

15:50.533 --> 15:53.243
That's not the way to talk around your son.

15:53.328 --> 15:56.121
You need to comfort him, not frighten him.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.960
That's right. I know.

16:02.045 --> 16:06.381
I'm sorry, Augusten.
I'm just very upset right now.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.718
Sit down, Deirdre.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.388
Good night, Augusten.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.646
Now.

16:22.607 --> 16:26.735
I'm gonna ask you a number of questions
if that's all right with you.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.739
They may seem rather personal.
Ln fact, you may not see the relevance.

16:30.823 --> 16:36.703
But I believe that's up to me,
as the doctor, to decide.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.831
So,

16:40.792 --> 16:42.125
your

16:43.336 --> 16:45.087
anxiety level.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.674
How would you describe it?

16:53.137 --> 16:55.097
Well, I'm just frantic.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.558
I'm very, very upset. I'm very anxious.

16:59.727 --> 17:03.772
I feel very emotionally charged.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.233
And I feel like I'm at the end of my rope.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.112
Tell me about your bowel movements.

17:10.195 --> 17:13.031
Have you noticed any changes
either in regularity,

17:13.116 --> 17:16.617
or the shape and density
of the bowel matter itself?

17:19.288 --> 17:20.914
ls that really...

17:20.957 --> 17:24.542
I mean... Do we have to...

17:24.627 --> 17:30.090
What I'm getting at is constipation.
Both literal and subconscious.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.969
Are you constipated in your life, Deirdre?

17:34.721 --> 17:35.929
Stuck?

17:40.309 --> 17:41.643
I am.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.020
I am stuck.

17:45.273 --> 17:49.317
I understand you write a lot.
Are you energetic when you write? Frantic?

17:49.986 --> 17:51.486
Well...

17:53.489 --> 17:58.493
When I write I'm writing from
my unconscious. Or I'm trying to.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.996
Do you have sex with your husband?

18:06.878 --> 18:08.670
-Yes.
-Do you enjoy it?

18:15.178 --> 18:17.179
Back to your anxiety for a moment.

18:17.221 --> 18:20.640
You have thoughts of suicide, Deirdre?

18:21.976 --> 18:24.144
Do you have suicidal thoughts?

18:24.187 --> 18:26.897
Do you ever think of killing yourself?

18:34.906 --> 18:38.867
And how often would you say
you have these thoughts of suicide?

18:48.544 --> 18:51.379
Right after I have sex with my husband.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.100
What are those?

19:04.393 --> 19:05.769
Valium.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.606
To quiet the nerves.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.881
ls he an MD doctor?

19:34.924 --> 19:38.134
Yes, and as I've told you 1 00 times,
he got his MD at Yale.

19:38.219 --> 19:40.595
And you heard about this guy from where?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.222
Dr. Nupal.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.517
Augusten's allergist.

19:45.601 --> 19:50.772
If you were more of a man and involved
in your son's life, you'd know who that was.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.732
I smell manure.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.485
I don't smell anything.

19:55.570 --> 19:58.822
I do, I smell manure.
It's coming out of your ears.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.786
Fucking bitch.

20:06.080 --> 20:10.500
I'm unhappy.

20:10.585 --> 20:14.170
Norman, if you're so unhappy,
why stay in this marriage?

20:15.798 --> 20:17.674
I don't know why.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.050
My son.

20:19.135 --> 20:23.805
I don't think that's why you stay, Norman.
I think you stay because it's comfortable.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.390
It's what you know.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.393
You were trapped in your childhood
by a castrating mother,

20:28.477 --> 20:32.188
and as an adult male you have sought
the same female archetype.

20:32.815 --> 20:36.985
Well, that's just brilliant. And very true.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.615
Deirdre, smoking is a great privilege
in my sanctuary.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.160
But for you, I will allow it.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.579
Thank you.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.211
So you're saying we should split up?

20:55.296 --> 20:57.923
Ln order to reach that conclusion, Norman,

20:58.007 --> 21:02.552
I would need to see both you and Deirdre
on a regular and disciplined basis.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.179
For five hours a day.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.348
I'm available, Dr. Finch.

21:06.390 --> 21:10.352
Five hours a day?
I can't do that. I have to work!

21:10.394 --> 21:13.355
See, Dr. Finch, I told you.
I'm married to a narcissist.

21:13.397 --> 21:18.360
Norman, if I'm willing to clear my schedule
to save your marriage but you're not,

21:18.444 --> 21:19.986
then get out.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.322
Leave this office, go home,

21:22.365 --> 21:25.659
and start dividing your books
and your record albums.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.410
This is bullshit.

21:28.204 --> 21:31.289
This is really fucking bullshit.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.007
What are you writing?

21:45.096 --> 21:48.890
"Norman Burroughs is homicidal.
He is an unapologetic alcoholic.

21:48.975 --> 21:52.936
"He is dangerous, a threat to himself,
his wife and his child."

22:02.738 --> 22:04.739
Finally, somebody sees.

22:12.581 --> 22:15.250
Deirdre, express yourself. Let it out.

22:15.292 --> 22:18.378
Tell Augusten and I why you are crying.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.422
'Cause I...

22:21.424 --> 22:24.175
I did love Norman once, long ago,

22:24.260 --> 22:27.679
but I never should've married him.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.681
So why did you?

22:30.307 --> 22:35.186
He threatened to kill himself if I turned
down his proposal. I'm not a murderer.

22:35.438 --> 22:38.231
I've failed as a wife and a mother.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.899
Yes, you have.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.777
But Deirdre,

22:42.820 --> 22:46.823
you can't stay with a man
who doesn't see your gift.

22:49.118 --> 22:52.746
You are a brilliant, brilliant poet.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.292
Augusten, have you any questions
to ask me

22:57.334 --> 22:59.794
concerning the state of
your parents' marriage?

22:59.879 --> 23:01.504
I do have one question.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.215
What's behind that door?

23:04.717 --> 23:05.842
That?

23:06.469 --> 23:09.012
That leads to an adjacent room

23:10.473 --> 23:11.973
where I masturbate.

23:21.484 --> 23:23.068
Dr. Finch...

23:23.152 --> 23:27.822
As evolved as I may indeed be,
I'm still a human being, Deirdre.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.199
A male human being.

23:29.283 --> 23:32.869
I am still very much a man.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.750
Would you like a tour?

23:50.262 --> 23:52.180
FINCH: What is this, Hope?

23:52.223 --> 23:56.059
Jesus Christ, Dad!
You scared the shit out of me.

23:56.143 --> 23:59.521
Hope, you've no business being in here!
This is my masturbatorium!

23:59.605 --> 24:03.608
-And you're using my blanket.
-I was just taking a nap.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.194
Nap? This is not the place for naps!

24:08.239 --> 24:11.074
Go mind the telephone. Make fresh coffee.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.827
Do your job, like a responsible woman.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.098
He's leaving.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.811
Now I can focus on my writing.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.338
This is nice.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.425
Maybe I'll become a doctor.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.802
It's just down here, on the right.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.437
That's not it.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.481
ls it?

26:07.775 --> 26:09.067
Lt can't be.

26:09.151 --> 26:12.237
This is it, Augusten.
This is Dr. Finch's house.

26:35.386 --> 26:37.303

Hello, Deirdre. Come in.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.541
Oh, Freud.

27:07.209 --> 27:10.670
Well, you must be Augusten,
isn't that right?

27:11.046 --> 27:14.716
Yes, well, I'm Agnes. I'm Dr. Finch's wife.

27:15.175 --> 27:18.845
Well, make yourselves at home.
I'll go get the doctor.

27:19.722 --> 27:20.722
(FREUD MEOWING)

27:25.978 --> 27:27.061
I'll wait in the car.

27:27.104 --> 27:30.023
No, no, you will not wait in the car.
It'll be hours and it's rude.

27:30.065 --> 27:33.484
You just stay here.
Get along with the Finch children.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.740
FINCH: Up here, Deirdre.

28:10.064 --> 28:11.606

28:33.337 --> 28:35.421
Would you like to try some?

28:36.965 --> 28:38.132
No.

28:38.759 --> 28:39.759
Thanks.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.345
Why does everybody make such a fuss?

28:42.930 --> 28:44.806
It's just a little kibble.

28:46.517 --> 28:48.476
That stuff's not clean.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.770
It's for dogs.

28:50.813 --> 28:54.107
Well, I guess you're afraid
to try new things, Augusten.

28:55.818 --> 28:57.151
Sad.

29:02.783 --> 29:05.952
Isn't it a little early for Christmas?

29:06.870 --> 29:08.371
You mean late.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.498
It's been up for two years.

Oh, way to go, kiddie-poo.

29:57.379 --> 29:58.504
Hey.

29:59.256 --> 30:02.216
I'm Natalie. The other daughter.

-Augusten.
-I know.

What's with the clothes, choir boy?
Are you going to church?

30:15.147 --> 30:16.397
I just pooped.

30:18.692 --> 30:21.819
John Moses is the kid
of one of my dad's patients.

30:22.279 --> 30:23.905
We watch him sometimes.

keep you occupied.

(MAN CHATTERING ON TV)

-What is it?
-It's an electroshock therapy machine.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.924
My dad used to use it on patients
all the time.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.676
Until the police came.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.390
Come on, it'll be a wicked blast.
Help me move it.

30:59.274 --> 31:02.235
So why is Dr. Finch seeing patients
in his house now?

31:03.820 --> 31:08.282
Well, you know how President Carter makes
us drive 40 miles out of our way to buy gas?

31:08.367 --> 31:09.825
Because we're in...

31:11.036 --> 31:12.745
An energy crisis?

31:13.205 --> 31:14.413
Right.

31:15.082 --> 31:18.292
Well, that means people don't have
extra money for luxuries like mental health,

31:18.377 --> 31:21.796
so he's lost a lot of patients.
He's downsizing.

31:24.258 --> 31:25.800
Are you ready?

31:25.968 --> 31:27.093
For what?

31:27.803 --> 31:29.470
Are you retarded?

31:32.057 --> 31:33.599
To play doctor.

31:38.647 --> 31:43.734
Okay. Well, I'll be the doctor
and you can be the nurse.

31:43.819 --> 31:46.654
I'm not gonna be some cunt-licking nurse.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.824
I'll be my father and you be your mother.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.325
Okay.

How are we feeling today, Deirdre?

32:00.127 --> 32:02.253
I'm blocked, Dr. Finch.

32:02.337 --> 32:04.880
I can't tap into my subconscious.

32:05.674 --> 32:09.218
I feel I do have a classic in me.

32:09.303 --> 32:12.346
I feel I am owed a Pulitzer Prize,

32:12.431 --> 32:16.142
even though I've only published one book
I paid for myself.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.984
It's very clear to me now.

go deep into his subconscious mind.

Awesome. But can you do it later?
Dad wants to see Augusten in the kitchen.

Take a seat, son.

Augusten, your mother is in a state of crisis.

That's an understatement.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.112
Your mother is in trouble with your father.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.909
Your father may want to murder
your mother.

34:43.623 --> 34:44.748
Murder?

34:45.708 --> 34:48.293
Your father is a very, very sick man.

34:50.755 --> 34:54.007
Your mother needs to be protected.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.015
What do we do?

35:02.058 --> 35:06.479
Well, I'm gonna take your mother to a motel
and you're gonna stay here.

But...

35:16.865 --> 35:18.908
I don't wanna stay here.

Deirdre, talk to your son.

35:29.044 --> 35:31.879
When you're finished, I'll be in the car.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.222
Mom, what's going on?

35:42.599 --> 35:45.768
(SLURRING) Your father has a lot of anger

35:46.812 --> 35:48.687
about how his life turned out.

35:48.730 --> 35:51.232
He's projecting it onto me.

35:52.067 --> 35:55.611
Dr. Finch is spiritually evolved.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.531
We'll be safe with him.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.913
Can't I come to the motel too?

36:06.998 --> 36:08.999
I love those little soaps.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.837
No.

36:15.215 --> 36:17.925
The doctor thinks that it's best.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.347
For how long?

36:23.431 --> 36:27.393
Not long. A few days, maybe a week.

36:28.812 --> 36:31.981
A week? I can't stay here for a week!

36:32.399 --> 36:35.943
Augusten, don't argue with me. Not now.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.905
I'll visit you in my dreams.

36:42.325 --> 36:44.493
Did you know I can do that?

36:46.204 --> 36:50.624
Once, I had a dream I went to Mexico,

36:50.667 --> 36:54.211
and when I woke up
there were pesos in my hand.

37:03.305 --> 37:05.264
I'm going to go now.

AUGUSTEN: Dear journal, somebody has
to write down what's happening to me.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.511
It's not to be believed.

38:25.553 --> 38:28.305
So I guess that person is me.

38:28.390 --> 38:31.600
Day seven and still no sign of my mother.

38:31.685 --> 38:35.562
This place is worse than any loony bin.
I'm not kidding.

38:35.605 --> 38:38.857
Every decision in the house is made by
something the Finches call...

38:38.900 --> 38:40.401
Bible dipping.

38:40.902 --> 38:44.655
It's like asking a Magic 8-ball a question,
only you're asking God.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.784
Ask God a question, Augusten.

38:48.868 --> 38:49.910
I don't know.

38:49.953 --> 38:52.413
AGNES: Oh, for goodness' sakes, Augusten,
it's not that hard.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.748
Should we have fish sticks for dinner?

38:56.710 --> 38:58.544
"Awakening."

38:58.586 --> 39:02.131
As in, awakening our taste buds.

39:02.590 --> 39:05.134
Super, God wants us to have fish sticks.

39:05.301 --> 39:08.554
Shit, I wanted McDonald's so bad.

39:09.389 --> 39:13.267
AUGUSTEN: Of the daughters, Hope is by far
Finch's favorite. I know this because...

39:13.351 --> 39:16.395
Hope, you are by far my favorite daughter.

39:23.028 --> 39:27.614
Stop antagonizing me, Natalie. Just stop
transferring all of your anger onto me.

39:27.657 --> 39:29.616
Please make an appointment to see Dad.

39:29.659 --> 39:32.578
You know what? Your avoidance tactics
aren't gonna work, Miss Hope.

39:32.620 --> 39:36.790
You're the one that hates me
and you're gonna have to confront that.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.459
ls this really our dinner?

39:38.543 --> 39:43.213
Fish sticks and grapes, that's all you get.
I am not a maid and I'm not a chef.

39:43.965 --> 39:47.134
You know, Natalie, you're so oral
you'll never get to anal.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.971
And you're never gonna get a dick in
your dried-out cunt, you old maid.

39:51.014 --> 39:54.266
Excellent, Natalie,
your hysteria is spectacular.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.894
You're moving from the anal
onto the phallic.

39:57.687 --> 39:59.313
I'm very proud.

40:06.613 --> 40:09.239
AUGUSTEN: Oh, did I mention that Hope
is an animal lover?

40:09.324 --> 40:10.866
She has a cat named Freud...

40:10.950 --> 40:13.327
-Freud is dying.
-...that speaks to her.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.163
She told me through her purrs,
which I can translate.

40:16.206 --> 40:21.418
Hope, Freud wasn't talking to you,
because fucking cats can't talk.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.171
This is animal abuse.

40:24.214 --> 40:28.008
Augusten, be sexier. Make them want you.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.511
She asked me to do this to her.

40:31.513 --> 40:33.430
She contacted me during REM sleep

40:33.515 --> 40:36.600
and said that she'd hung on
as long as she could.

40:37.560 --> 40:41.021
And she wants me to sit with her
so she doesn't die alone.

40:42.190 --> 40:43.524
What are you all doing in here?

40:43.566 --> 40:46.902
You better not be engaging
in pot or other activities.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.404
Shut up, you hag. Leave us alone.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.409
So how long are you gonna be
carrying around that basket?

40:54.494 --> 40:56.078
Until Freud dies.

40:57.872 --> 41:00.124
Which should be the end of the week.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.384
AUGUSTEN: According to Hope,
Freud died of kitty leukemia.

41:11.511 --> 41:12.553
According to me,

41:12.637 --> 41:17.349
Freud died of being trapped in a laundry
basket for four days without food or water.

41:18.434 --> 41:20.853
Augusten, pay your respects.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.539
(HORN HONKING)

41:54.095 --> 41:56.471
Am I coming home for good now?

41:56.556 --> 41:59.892
(SLURRING) No, baby. Just a weekend visit.

42:27.420 --> 42:29.880
You should let me cut your bangs.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.757
It'd be really cool.

42:33.801 --> 42:36.803
So is that what you wanna be?
A hairdresser?

42:36.888 --> 42:39.181
Well, don't say "hairdresser."

42:39.265 --> 42:42.351
Say professional, licensed cosmetologist.

42:43.686 --> 42:47.940
But what I really want is
to own my own hair empire, you know?

42:47.982 --> 42:49.816
Like Vidal Sassoon.

42:51.986 --> 42:53.278
What?

42:53.905 --> 42:55.864
What do you wanna be?

43:01.204 --> 43:02.496
Her.

43:03.998 --> 43:07.125
Coed, majoring in literature.

43:07.669 --> 43:09.336
You should apply.

43:10.046 --> 43:12.089
They'd never let me in.

43:12.173 --> 43:14.549
Why not? You're smart.

43:16.135 --> 43:17.761
But I'm a Finch.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.181
I'm used goods.

43:25.103 --> 43:28.689
Besides, can you imagine
the college background check?

43:29.190 --> 43:32.859
When they find out what goes on in
that house, it'd be like Frenkenstein,

43:32.902 --> 43:37.656
when the villagers surround the castle
and then burn it to the fucking ground.

43:44.872 --> 43:46.206
I'm gay.

43:49.335 --> 43:50.627
Big deal.

43:51.713 --> 43:53.130
I know.

43:55.008 --> 43:57.467
My adopted brother Neil's gay too.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.554
Where does he live?

44:00.638 --> 44:03.348
He used to live out back in the barn.

44:03.391 --> 44:06.393
Then he got mad at my Dad because he
wouldn't give him a real room in the house,

44:06.436 --> 44:08.770
so he moved to some boarding house.

44:08.855 --> 44:12.691
He rents a single room out there.
Kinda like a pied-Ã -terre.

44:13.234 --> 44:15.527
You two should meet.
I think you'd really like each other.

44:15.570 --> 44:16.987
Two, please.

44:20.199 --> 44:21.408
Thanks.

44:39.093 --> 44:41.928
NEIL: That director is fucked up.

44:42.013 --> 44:45.640
AUGUSTEN: I've seen that like four times
this week already.

44:45.725 --> 44:47.517
I love French movies.

44:47.810 --> 44:52.731
First cousins fall in love and then stab
each other as the weeping clown appears.

44:55.276 --> 44:58.612
I don't really understand
the weeping clown part but...

44:59.364 --> 45:01.948
Lt represents the loss of innocence.

45:05.286 --> 45:06.953
Wanna check out my wheels?

45:07.705 --> 45:09.956
-Sure.
-Come on.

45:12.293 --> 45:14.294
So do you see your mom at all?

45:14.962 --> 45:16.254
Sometimes.

45:17.298 --> 45:18.882
On the weekends.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.094
It's tough to have a sick mom, right?

45:23.262 --> 45:26.431
My mom couldn't handle me either.
Neither could my dad.

45:26.516 --> 45:29.726
Yeah, mine too. He never wants to see me.

45:30.311 --> 45:32.020
Where does that leave you?

45:32.105 --> 45:35.399
At the crazy house of the even crazier Finch.

45:35.483 --> 45:37.150
Do you think he's crazy?

45:37.693 --> 45:39.569
Ln a good way. I think he's a genius.

45:39.654 --> 45:42.697
Like when I was your age
and I'd have a rage seizure,

45:42.782 --> 45:45.700
he'd put on music
to lower my blood pressure.

45:45.785 --> 45:50.622
Nat King Cole, Stardust,
revolutionary sort of stuff, you know?

45:50.832 --> 45:52.541
Worked every time.

45:53.334 --> 45:57.337
If he hadn't adopted me, shit,
I don't know what I would've done.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.297
Well, here she is.

46:01.426 --> 46:04.428
But couldn't you have just been his patient?

46:04.512 --> 46:07.806
I mean, I don't understand
why he had to adopt you.

46:08.516 --> 46:12.269
Well, Finch believes that
a person becomes an adult at 1 3.

46:13.187 --> 46:16.314
At that age, no adult can tell them
what to do.

46:17.692 --> 46:20.819
And they can choose their own parents.
I did it.

46:21.237 --> 46:22.821
Natalie did it.

46:22.864 --> 46:24.197
Natalie?

46:25.408 --> 46:27.576
Natalie never mentioned that to me.

46:27.660 --> 46:29.035
Oh, really?

46:31.622 --> 46:33.874
Ask her about Terrence Maxwell.

46:35.585 --> 46:37.544
You're over 1 3, right?

46:42.383 --> 46:45.051
Finchy saved my life, that's for sure.

46:46.804 --> 46:49.681
He was the first person I told I was gay.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.145
I'm gay too.

47:00.985 --> 47:05.071
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
so that's what this is about. You're gay?

47:05.823 --> 47:06.907
Yeah.

47:07.783 --> 47:10.118
I thought Natalie had told you.

47:14.999 --> 47:16.750
Small world, right?

47:17.210 --> 47:18.502
You, me.

47:18.961 --> 47:20.170
Crazy.

47:21.255 --> 47:22.464
Smoke?

47:27.470 --> 47:29.304
Here, let me light you.

47:42.485 --> 47:44.110
Want a ride home?

47:45.613 --> 47:46.780
Please.

47:47.323 --> 47:48.990
I won't go fast.

47:49.283 --> 47:50.450
Maybe.

48:01.837 --> 48:03.672
What just happened?

48:05.633 --> 48:07.801
You think you're gay, right?

48:07.885 --> 48:09.844
That's what gay men do.

48:10.471 --> 48:13.306
Just wanted you to know what you're in for.

48:16.477 --> 48:18.687
Want a beer? Smoke?

48:20.231 --> 48:21.314
No.

48:25.152 --> 48:28.905
AUGUSTEN: Journal, what can I say?
He drove a cool car.

48:31.993 --> 48:35.120
And it sure beat another crazy dinner
at the Finch house.

48:37.123 --> 48:39.833
There's a first time for everything, right?

48:48.175 --> 48:50.719
I took those. Ln New York.

48:53.681 --> 48:55.640
They're not very good.

48:56.809 --> 48:59.019
I'm not very good at anything.

48:59.061 --> 49:00.729
NEIL: I'm not very good at anything.

49:00.813 --> 49:07.527
(ECHOING) I'm not very good at anything.
I'm not very good at anything.

49:09.196 --> 49:10.447
Shut up.

49:12.241 --> 49:13.366
What?

49:15.036 --> 49:16.369
Nothing.

49:35.389 --> 49:38.016
AUGUSTEN: One positive thing
has come out of this.

49:39.143 --> 49:42.979
Nobody can ever say again
that I'm afraid of trying new things.

49:43.064 --> 49:46.399
Come on, get dressed.
I have to drive you back to Finch's.

49:49.362 --> 49:51.363
I wanna go to my mom's.

50:13.636 --> 50:15.762
You okay with what happened?

50:18.099 --> 50:19.599
Yeah, sure.

50:36.992 --> 50:38.368
Well...

50:40.246 --> 50:42.080
Thanks for everything.

50:48.087 --> 50:49.462
Thank you.

50:50.631 --> 50:52.674
Thank you for everything.

51:24.915 --> 51:26.875
(MOANING)

51:32.840 --> 51:33.840
(SCREAMING)

51:33.924 --> 51:36.593
Oh, Fern. Fern. Fern...

51:36.677 --> 51:38.511
No, Fern, it's okay.

51:46.353 --> 51:48.855
No, no, no, it's okay.

51:56.113 --> 51:57.655
Augusten. Augusten.

51:57.698 --> 52:01.075
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

52:01.160 --> 52:03.119
Oh, God. God.

52:23.057 --> 52:25.433
I wish you enjoyed school more.

52:25.518 --> 52:29.604
Although I guess it must be very dull
compared to your life with me.

52:32.316 --> 52:35.193
Would you hand me my cover-up? I'm chilly.

52:39.198 --> 52:41.324
Watch it, Augusten!

52:42.117 --> 52:44.536
I've got a lit cigarette in my hand.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.955
Don't act out in anger.

52:47.748 --> 52:50.667
If you're upset by this, talk to me about it.

52:55.297 --> 52:57.423
How could I not have known?

53:01.804 --> 53:04.097
How long has this been happening?

53:04.974 --> 53:08.268
I've been in love with Fern
for a very long time.

53:08.936 --> 53:12.772
Our relationship became physical
a number of weeks ago.

53:14.275 --> 53:17.277
The intimate details
are between me and Fern.

53:20.447 --> 53:24.784
AUGUSTEN: Journal, I'm confused.
How can my mother be with Fern?

53:25.828 --> 53:27.829
Fern drives a Chevy Nova.

53:31.458 --> 53:33.293
I worry about you so.

53:34.795 --> 53:36.963
I worry about you in school.

53:37.631 --> 53:40.758
-The law says you have to go.
-Well, fuck that!

53:40.801 --> 53:43.511
Augusten, please don't smoke
my cigarettes.

53:44.054 --> 53:46.097
You have a pack of your own.

53:48.684 --> 53:51.811
-Although I wish you wouldn't smoke.
-Well, I do.

54:16.337 --> 54:18.880
All my life I've been oppressed, Augusten.

54:18.964 --> 54:22.717
And all my life I've worked hard
to fight that oppression.

54:22.801 --> 54:25.637
When I was a little girl
living in Cairo, Georgia,

54:25.679 --> 54:30.224
I had a black nanny named Elsa who
lived in a shack on the other side of town.

54:30.309 --> 54:33.853
And in those days black people
were called niggers.

54:33.896 --> 54:37.106
And I knew that word "nigger"
was a dirty word.

54:37.191 --> 54:39.817
And I knew it was a word
filled with hatred and anger.

54:39.860 --> 54:43.112
I knew Elsa was no nigger.
I knew it was wrong.

54:44.073 --> 54:47.825
It's taken me all my life
to claim myself as an artist

54:47.868 --> 54:49.994
and to claim myself as a woman.

54:50.037 --> 54:52.205
I have struggled against
the oppression of my mother

54:52.247 --> 54:53.539
and the oppression of your father,

54:53.624 --> 54:58.127
and for the first time in my life
I feel I am truly able to claim myself.

55:02.299 --> 55:06.928
And so, Augusten, I hope I have
your support in my relationship with Fern

55:07.012 --> 55:10.932
because at this stage in my life I do not
need and I will not accept more oppression.

55:11.016 --> 55:12.850
I have spent my entire life
fighting oppression.

55:12.893 --> 55:15.436
I hope I don't have to fight you too.

55:18.732 --> 55:20.441
Can I have $5?

55:20.526 --> 55:22.151
"May I have $5?"

55:23.570 --> 55:24.737
Why?

55:24.905 --> 55:28.074
So I can skip school tomorrow
and go to the movies.

55:31.704 --> 55:34.414
Go get my pocketbook. I'll take a look.

55:36.291 --> 55:38.334
Do you like my new house?

55:39.253 --> 55:41.087
I need high ceilings.

55:48.095 --> 55:52.765
So, you've been spending a lot of time
at the Finches' house.

55:54.018 --> 55:56.853
Are there other options I'm not aware of?

56:08.449 --> 56:09.741
What is this?

56:12.244 --> 56:13.703
Adoption papers.

56:17.291 --> 56:20.543
Dr. Finch has agreed to become
your legal guardian.

56:22.504 --> 56:23.755
What?

56:28.719 --> 56:32.764
After discussing this with the doctor,
we both feel this really is the best option.

56:32.806 --> 56:36.309
He and his family can give you
the attention you need.

56:38.979 --> 56:41.522
You're giving me away to your shrink?

56:42.858 --> 56:44.150
No.

56:45.152 --> 56:48.613
I'm doing what's best for you.
What's best for us.

56:50.282 --> 56:52.492
I love you very, very much.

56:54.286 --> 56:58.247
I will always be your parent.
And you will always be my child.

57:19.728 --> 57:22.855
And my fucking father
won't even give me money for food.

57:23.732 --> 57:25.566
He won't take my calls.

57:25.651 --> 57:28.528
Yeah. He's basically worthless.

57:29.488 --> 57:31.155
Just like my mom.

57:32.157 --> 57:34.867
Just like the fucking nuns who beat me.

57:36.829 --> 57:37.954
God.

57:39.706 --> 57:44.460
Sometimes I feel like just taking
a butcher knife and just stabbing them both.

57:46.296 --> 57:48.005
I understand.

57:50.467 --> 57:52.718
You're the only one who does.

57:54.096 --> 57:56.556
FINCH: How close are you
to Bookman, Augusten?

57:57.516 --> 58:01.394
Lt started out as just friends,
and now it's more than that.

58:01.770 --> 58:03.729
This is a sexual relationship?

58:07.442 --> 58:09.277
Bookman isn't a stable man.

58:09.361 --> 58:13.197
His problems run very, very deep.

58:13.490 --> 58:14.699
He seems okay.

58:14.950 --> 58:17.326
Well, I'm not saying you can't see him.

58:17.911 --> 58:20.746
After all, as you say,
you are already involved.

58:20.789 --> 58:23.875
But I just want you to keep me abreast
of the situation.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.418
Fine.

58:25.502 --> 58:29.088
Now, would you like some of these?

58:31.550 --> 58:32.592
What are they?

58:32.676 --> 58:36.262
Well, I just got some samples in the mail,
so I don't know.

58:36.346 --> 58:37.889
So let me see.

58:43.270 --> 58:48.566
This is mild anti-anxiety medication

58:48.650 --> 58:51.527
which might help you feel a little calmer...

58:52.196 --> 58:53.196
I'm calm.

58:53.280 --> 58:55.323
...when I tell you

58:55.407 --> 58:57.450
you have to go to school.

58:59.119 --> 59:02.788
-I go to school.
-I'm on to your clever tricks, son.

59:02.873 --> 59:06.918
I know you stay until homeroom, when
they do attendance, and then you skip out.

59:06.960 --> 59:09.795
I know when you've been naughty.

59:12.341 --> 59:14.467
What are you, Santa Claus?

59:19.598 --> 59:24.518
If by that you're asking
am I the great patriarch, the father-giver,

59:24.603 --> 59:27.188
who fulfills wishes and challenges dreams

59:27.272 --> 59:31.150
and brings merriment
to those who are suffering,

59:31.235 --> 59:35.613
well, then yes, Augusten, I am Santa Claus.

59:36.406 --> 59:37.865
I'm not going!

59:37.950 --> 59:41.202
You're in junior high, for Christ's sake.
Lt can't be that bad.

59:43.497 --> 59:45.164
I don't fit in.

59:52.881 --> 59:56.092
Where would we be
without our painful childhoods?

59:59.721 --> 01:00:02.556
Well, the only loophole, or way I can see
of getting you out of schooI

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:07.687
for any considerable length of time,
would be for you to commit suicide.

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:14.568
-You want me to kill myself?
-Well, if you try to kill yourself,

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:18.364
I could explain to the school board
that you are psychologically unfit to attend,

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.825
and that you needed intensive treatment.

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:24.453
Lt would be a staged suicide attempt.

01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:27.707
Of course, your poor mother would have
to find you and drive you to the hospital,

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:31.377
where you would stay for three weeks,
or a month, for observation.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.508
I don't know, it doesn't... I don't...

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:39.427
Augusten.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.847
Where is your spirit of adventure?

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:47.476
Augusten, stay with us!

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:50.521
You're in a hospital. We gotta get
these pills out of your stomach.

Oh, God, Augusten, wake up!

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:54.442
Don't you die on me! Wake up! Augusten!

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:56.527
Wake up! Wake up!

No, get away from me! Get away!

The lady at the store said it has illustrations

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:56.295
of all the procedures
that cosmetology students have to master

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.631
before they earn their license.

01:02:06.515 --> 01:02:09.934
Cold waves. Those are really hard.

01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:13.771
Well, now you can learn how to do them.

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:19.902
It's good to have a dream, Augusten.

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:23.989
Dreams get you through the hard times.

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:34.041
What's your dream?

01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:35.751
Me?

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:41.966
I was never fancy enough
to have one of those.

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:45.469
I was always too busy.

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:46.804
Working.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.932
Well, so the doctor could go to school and...

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:51.851
No.

01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:56.605
Then the kids came and...

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.444
Raising a family keeps you on the run and...

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:09.285
Maybe that was your dream.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.204
To have a family.

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:15.624
Yes.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:20.546
That was a dream.

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:29.305

Oh, my fucking hair! Oh, my God!

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:55.284
That was funny.

01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:58.120
You should be laughing.

You know what, Augusten?

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.549
I'm not gonna throw you a pity party.

Fuck you, Natalie. You don't know
what it's like to be sent away.

have a boyfriend that's just using you!

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:21.393
Lucky me.

Who's Terrence Maxwell, Natalie?

01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:31.236
I've never heard of him.

-Tell me who he is.
-Shut up.

-Lt kills you, doesn't it?
-Shut up.

-Let it out!
-Shut up.

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:44.083
-Tell me who he is, Natalie!
-Shut up.

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.085
Tell me so I don't feel so alone!

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:49.713
He was the only one I ever loved
and he doesn't want me anymore!

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:51.548
Do you feel better?

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:03.727
A little bit.

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:07.398
How'd you meet him?

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:13.487
Terrence started seeing my dad
after his mom died.

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:18.534
She left him everything.

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:29.002
He was 41 when I was 1 3.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:35.092
He told me I was pretty.

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:40.139
And he made me believe it.

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:45.144
One day he broke my collar bone

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:51.316
and I had to hitchhike
to the emergency room,

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:54.820
and I passed out on the side of the road
and somebody found me.

01:07:57.532 --> 01:08:02.161
My dad told him that he would press
charges and that he would go to jail,

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:05.497
unless he donated money
to my college fund.

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:08.500
And he did.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.463
$75,000.

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.091
That's so great.

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:19.845
-So, if you just apply...
-My dad spent it.

01:08:22.055 --> 01:08:23.599
Every penny.

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:28.187
So that the IRS wouldn't take this house.

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:41.073
So I do know what it's like, Augusten,

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:47.080
to love somebody who doesn't deserve it.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.752
Because they're all you have.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.136
God, I hate my life.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:07.559
I hate this kitchen.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.737
I need high ceilings.

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.201

I'm a fuckup and it's your fault!

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:20.757
That's right, Neil,
blame your father for your inability to focus.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.135
Direct all that rage at me
if it makes you feel better.

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:26.221
I can't focus because of the voices!

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:28.307

Yeah? Camera never lies, see?

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:40.444
My parents have given you
thousands of dollars and I'm still sick!

01:10:40.612 --> 01:10:43.530
You haven't helped me get better!
You know what I do!

01:10:43.615 --> 01:10:45.657
And you haven't helped me get better!

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:52.456

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:54.917

Yes. Why are you here?

01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:17.147
Because I want you
to stop seeing my husband.

You're right, Neil, you're right.
I've done nothing, apparently.

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:30.369
I've never pulled any strings,

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.788
gotten you a scholarship
to the University of Rochester

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:36.500
to pursue your photographic interests.
Absolutely nothing.

(GRUNTING)

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:42.547
You just wanted to get rid of me.

I don't wanna get rid of Augusten.
He's part of the family now.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:52.557
It's just you. I just need you to go.

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:57.229
But then I'd miss my therapy.
I need Dr. Finch.

01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:59.022
No, I need Dr. Finch!

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:03.652
I'm not as pretty as you
and I don't have your talent.

01:12:04.404 --> 01:12:08.865
All I have is this family.
And this family doesn't work without him.

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:12.119
Why won't you let me live in the house
and be a part of this family?

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:16.331
Because I am the patriarch, and when the
patriarch says jump, you jump, God damn it!

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:19.918
You don't cooperate, Neil,
and for that you're punished.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.763
That's not why you won't let me live
in this house.

01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:34.016
You won't let me 'cause you're afraid of me,
aren't you?

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:37.102
Of what I could do to you in the
middle of the night while you're sleeping?

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.771
You're afraid of my anger,
aren't you, Doctor?

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:43.942
Our time is up, Neil.

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:48.739
I believe we've made a breakthrough today.

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:02.335
Really?

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:16.683
I am to see the doctor now.

-Will you be kind to him?
-I will.

01:13:49.717 --> 01:13:52.636
That's why I'm blocked, Dr. Finch,
I'm sure of it.

01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:55.764
You're not blocked because of Fern, Deirdre.

01:13:56.307 --> 01:14:00.268
You're constipated creatively
because of the rage you are not expressing.

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:07.025

a suitable companion, Deirdre.

You need someone who worships you,
who will feed your talent.

01:14:46.566 --> 01:14:48.900

her fingernails to match her mood.

What color are we today, Dorothy?

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:05.250
Shell pink. I've had a nice day.

Dorothy has a trust fund.

I've always wanted a daughter.

The ceiling was crushing us.

01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:41.494
So we made a skylight.

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:52.297
I think it brings a much-needed
sense of humor to the kitchen.

we can all just live in the car,

for two hours.

Well, I wouldn't have to pull at it
if it wasn't so naturally hideous.

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:28.972
I'm not a child, Hope.

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:35.103
You're right, Augusten, you're not.
I'm sorry, you're very mature.

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:40.817
It's just that I was speaking of the love
you have when you're older. Mature love.

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:44.070
And what do you, Miss Iceberg,
know about mature love?

01:19:44.155 --> 01:19:47.949
When was the last time you had anything
in your twat besides a tampon?

01:19:48.159 --> 01:19:50.076
That is the fucking truth.

01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:55.874
All right, Bookman, that's enough!

01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:01.963
I'm certainly not gonna listen to you
when you're talking like a teenage boy!

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:11.055
What's in this? I'm starving.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:14.350
Oh, this and that. My secret ingredient.

01:20:15.895 --> 01:20:17.479
Would you like to try?

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:30.074
What's the secret ingredient?

01:20:31.368 --> 01:20:32.535
Freud.

01:20:40.794 --> 01:20:43.505
Freud's dead, Hope. You buried her.

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:47.926
I heard her calling me.
She wanted me to dig her up.

01:20:48.219 --> 01:20:51.179
She asked to be reincarnated as a stew.

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:54.098
Oh, my God.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:57.685
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:00.980
You fucking lunatic!
I knew you were insane!

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:07.946
I don't eat pussy. Psycho.

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.198
Come on, Augusten, let's go.

01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:14.118
I want my beads back, Hope.

01:21:17.248 --> 01:21:19.582
I was just kidding, you jerks!

01:21:27.925 --> 01:21:30.176
(FEIGNING LAUGHTER)

01:21:30.261 --> 01:21:32.554
Got some of my anger out.

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:39.477
Today, we are going to explore
sense memory.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.980
I'd like everybody to take
their blade of grass

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:45.066
and stroke their cheeks
with their eyes closed.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:48.111
Other senses are heightened
when the eyes are closed.

01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:58.413
It's very soothing, isn't it?

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:01.833
All right.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:05.712
Neil, I believe you have a poem
you'd like to read today.

01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:07.213
Yes.

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:13.303
Deirdre, I'm not sure I feel comfortable
with a man in our safe space.

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:15.972
I guess, emotionally.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.684
I just need time to process this.

01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:22.770
Joan, Neil is a beautiful and sensitive poet.

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:24.772
He's part of my family

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:28.526
and we are going to welcome him today
with open arms and open ears.

01:22:30.529 --> 01:22:32.071
Okay, fine.

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:33.990
But he's a man.

01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:37.368
Joan, what you need to focus on
is not the presence of a man in this room,

01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:40.455
but the lack of your mother's presence
in your poetry.

01:22:46.086 --> 01:22:47.128
Neil.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:59.932
"The Angry Nun."

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:02.560
By Neil Bookman.

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:06.606
"Bitch!

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:08.107
"Whore of Jesus!

01:23:08.192 --> 01:23:12.445
"Dressed in black, you do not bleed like
a woman should bleed between the legs!

01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:18.326
"But with your ruler, your crucifix of hatred,
you strike my tender flesh!

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:20.662
"I bleed for you!

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:24.415
"Oh, Mother."

01:23:28.128 --> 01:23:30.213
And then I ran out of ink.

01:23:31.882 --> 01:23:35.426
Good anger.
Lt ended exactly at the right moment.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:42.100
Augusten, would you make me
some iced tea?

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:47.397
My new medicine makes my throat so dry.

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:49.273
Baby, I'll get it. I got it.

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:53.736
DEIRDRE: All right, all right, Neil. Let's
break it down. Let's break it down for Neil.

01:23:55.948 --> 01:23:59.826
Look, I always get my mom
something to drink when she works. Okay?

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:03.204
-That's our thing.
-Your mother is my thing now.

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:08.126
Are we having a stare-down contest?

01:24:08.961 --> 01:24:10.128
Yeah.

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:13.715
What do you want?
What do you want? Money?

01:24:13.841 --> 01:24:17.760
Here's 50 bucks.
Go chase the ice-cream truck.

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:19.846
Leave!

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:27.186
You think this whole thing is funny,
don't you?

01:24:27.271 --> 01:24:30.398
You look at my mom's craziness
as something to entertain you!

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:32.984
You are so mundane.
Your mother is an artist.

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:37.864
If you want Hamburger Helper, cupcake,
you need to find yourself another mother.

01:24:43.287 --> 01:24:45.204
Everyone! Come quickly!

01:24:46.707 --> 01:24:49.125
Wake up! Wake up!

01:24:49.168 --> 01:24:50.626
A miracle!

01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:56.799
A miracle! A miracle has occurred!

01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:06.934
What are you looking at?

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:08.853
Dad's morning shit.

01:25:08.896 --> 01:25:12.482
See? See how the tip of the coil
is breaking out of the surface of the water?

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:13.608
Holy Father.

01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:15.193
Doctor.

01:25:15.235 --> 01:25:17.612
Let me draw you a nice bath.

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:19.781
Agnes.

01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:24.035
Go get a shoehorn. A shoehorn, Agnes.

01:25:27.748 --> 01:25:29.540
HOPE: But what does it mean, Dad?

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:32.376
FINCH: Lt means our financial situation
is turning round.

01:25:32.419 --> 01:25:35.046
Lt means
things are looking upward, literally.

01:25:35.088 --> 01:25:38.883
The shit is pointing out of the pot,
towards heaven, to God.

01:25:39.051 --> 01:25:40.051
(GASPS)

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:43.596
My turd is a direct communication
from the Holy Father.

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:50.269
No, no, no, no, children. No. Laugh. Laugh.

01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:54.065
God is.
He is the funniest man in the universe.

01:25:58.362 --> 01:26:03.407
Agnes, I want you to carefully remove this,
take it outside and let it dry in the sun.

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:09.914
We're starting a shrine, Agnes, a shrine.

01:26:09.957 --> 01:26:11.916
Hope, let's prepare.

01:26:24.137 --> 01:26:26.472
Now I'll never get into Vassar.

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:52.915
Agnes?

01:26:56.503 --> 01:27:00.464
Somebody's gotta stay on top of things
in this house.

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:04.260
I am just trying to hold it all together.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:09.974
I need to ask you something.

01:27:12.311 --> 01:27:15.313
He's fine. The doctor will be fine.

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:18.316
He's just overextended.

01:27:18.358 --> 01:27:22.278
-That's not what I wanted to ask you.
-What do you want, Augusten?

01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:29.327
I want you to make me Hamburger Helper.

01:27:44.343 --> 01:27:47.887
AUGUSTEN: So there it was at last,
the awful truth.

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:51.515
Thank you.

01:27:54.353 --> 01:27:58.689
Unlike my mom, I guess I had finally tapped
into my subconscious.

01:28:17.668 --> 01:28:21.212
AUGUSTEN: Journal, I feel doomed.
I should be getting ready for college.

01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:23.881
Instead, I'm in my mother's
psychiatrist's house

01:28:23.924 --> 01:28:26.467
lying on a used twin bed
with pee stains on it.

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:31.222
How did my life take such a dismal turn?
What did I do wrong along the way?

01:28:39.856 --> 01:28:41.399
I turned 15 today.

01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:46.946
My parents used to make such a big deal
out of my birthdays, out of all the holidays.

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:51.659
I want it to be like it used to be, when I had
a family that tried to love each other.

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:54.328
Where nobody thought
that God was talking through their shit.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.710
I want a curfew.

01:29:00.752 --> 01:29:04.630
I want to be grounded for sleeping with
a 35-year-old schizophrenic.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:09.427
I want rules and boundaries,

01:29:10.303 --> 01:29:14.265
because what I've learned is that
without them

01:29:15.142 --> 01:29:18.561
all life is, is a series of surprises.

01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:27.987
Surprise!

01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:30.531
DOROTHY: We gotcha!

01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:35.536
Surprise.

01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:43.794
We gotcha! And you didn't see it coming.
No, you didn't.

01:29:43.879 --> 01:29:45.212
Smile.

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:02.021
Augusten, what's wrong?

01:30:03.482 --> 01:30:05.816
He's just overcome, that's all.

01:30:07.194 --> 01:30:08.903
I'll go get the matches.

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:22.666
This is good.

01:30:31.176 --> 01:30:32.551
Deirdre?

01:30:35.847 --> 01:30:37.848
FINCH: Deirdre, come along now.

01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:41.685
I'm not going to any goddamn hospital!

01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:44.897
Now, Deirdre, it's just for observation.

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:47.108
-This is bullshit!
-Dorothy!

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.778
I will not be observed!

01:30:51.321 --> 01:30:56.117
Deirdre, I have arranged
a very, very nice retreat for you in Vermont.

01:30:56.701 --> 01:31:00.162
But if you don't open the door,
we will have to get the police.

01:31:00.205 --> 01:31:02.706
No, don't you call the police!
Why you gotta go to call the pigs?

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:07.294
Oh, please! Oh, that's right, you think
anyone that's not a lesbian is a pig!

01:31:07.379 --> 01:31:09.380
-You're all pigs!
-Oh, you fucking selfish bitch!

01:31:09.422 --> 01:31:12.341
Filthy, stinking pigs!
You just wanna hurt her!

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:14.927
Will you stop? Please!

01:31:15.011 --> 01:31:16.345
You stop! You stop!

01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:18.389
NEIL: Oh, please, why don't you go out
and write your fucking poetry?

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:20.182
DOROTHY: You don't need a mother!
You need an exorcist!

01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:23.561
NIEL: Oh, you need a fucking bone
up your ass, that's what you need!

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:25.896
And you'd like that, you'd like that!

01:33:00.575 --> 01:33:01.575
Now.

01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:02.660
(WHIMPERING)

01:33:03.828 --> 01:33:05.371
-No, no.
-Shit, shit.

01:33:05.455 --> 01:33:06.789
We love you.

01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:11.168
No! No!

01:33:11.461 --> 01:33:13.796
No, let me go!

01:33:13.838 --> 01:33:15.172
Please let me go!

01:33:15.215 --> 01:33:17.716
Let me go!

01:33:49.291 --> 01:33:50.666
Thank you.

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:52.376
(AUDIENCE ROARING)

01:33:52.752 --> 01:33:54.295
Thank you.

01:33:54.379 --> 01:33:56.255
Oh, this is too much.

01:33:57.382 --> 01:33:59.383
Thank you so much.

01:34:06.933 --> 01:34:08.392
"Grief.

01:34:10.061 --> 01:34:11.937
"The angels are gone.

01:34:13.148 --> 01:34:15.232
DEIRDRE: "For weeks I searched for them

01:34:15.275 --> 01:34:18.610
"and took the precise measurements
of each room,

01:34:18.695 --> 01:34:21.447
"as if the house had grown smaller
in my grief."

01:34:22.866 --> 01:34:25.242
Not good enough. Boring. Repetitive.

01:34:25.327 --> 01:34:27.411
AUGUSTEN: Journal, good news.

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:31.498
After only a week of observation, my mother
has been released from the loony bin.

01:34:31.583 --> 01:34:33.334
Dr. Finch assures me she's doing well,

01:34:33.418 --> 01:34:37.838
and is writing a masterpiece that will finally
get her on The Merv Griffin Show.

01:34:43.803 --> 01:34:45.304
I wish I had that kind of discipline.

01:34:45.388 --> 01:34:49.099
Watch out. That's how he gets you
to fall in love with him.

01:34:52.687 --> 01:34:56.565
Our first date was at the movies.
My Fair Lady.

01:34:59.069 --> 01:35:01.403
I was so nervous my palms were sweaty.

01:35:02.447 --> 01:35:04.782
But Norman's hands were so dry.

01:35:05.658 --> 01:35:08.202
I found out later it was from psoriasis.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.956
He reached for my hand in the dark
and that was it.

01:35:15.377 --> 01:35:16.627
Hello, Norman.

01:35:18.129 --> 01:35:20.255
Hello, Deirdre. You look well.

01:35:23.301 --> 01:35:26.470
I'm sorry, Suzanne,
this is my ex-wife, Deirdre.

01:35:26.513 --> 01:35:28.972
And, Deirdre, this is my fiancÃ©e, Suzanne.

01:35:31.768 --> 01:35:32.768
Hello.

01:35:32.811 --> 01:35:36.146
It's nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:39.942
I've heard nothing about you.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:42.361
I open up my mailbox every day,

01:35:42.445 --> 01:35:44.988
hoping to get a child support check
from this deadbeat,

01:35:45.031 --> 01:35:48.283
but all I get is my own voice
echoing back at me.

01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:52.621
You drank our family's money away.

01:35:52.664 --> 01:35:56.458
I don't drink anymore, Deirdre.
I haven't had a drink in three years.

01:35:58.002 --> 01:36:00.254
Excuse me, could you get him a medal?

01:36:00.672 --> 01:36:02.005
I want my money!

01:36:02.173 --> 01:36:05.259
I sent your money
to that goddamn Svengali,

01:36:05.343 --> 01:36:09.930
and his lawyer sent me a paper
signed by you giving him power of attorney.

01:36:11.850 --> 01:36:14.059
No. I didn't approve that.

01:36:15.937 --> 01:36:18.188
Dr. Finch wouldn't do that.

01:36:20.191 --> 01:36:21.525
Did I tell you?

01:36:21.693 --> 01:36:24.862
What? Did you tell her what?
What did he tell you about me, Suzie Q?

01:36:24.904 --> 01:36:27.656
That I was a little housewife
with a stupid hobby?

01:36:27.699 --> 01:36:31.368
Well, that hobby has become quite lucrative,
thank you very much.

01:36:31.536 --> 01:36:33.454
I was just published in Yankee Magazine.

01:36:33.538 --> 01:36:35.080
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you
to quiet down and leave.

01:36:35.165 --> 01:36:37.374
What else did he tell you about me?
That I was crazy?

01:36:37.459 --> 01:36:40.711
He's the crazy one.
And he's a goddamn bastard.

01:36:40.753 --> 01:36:42.045
He doesn't even see his own son!

01:36:42.130 --> 01:36:44.798
He's tried.
From what I hear, neither do you, Deirdre.

01:36:44.883 --> 01:36:46.508
Shut up, you cunt!

01:36:47.218 --> 01:36:48.260
All right, that's it. Let's go.

01:36:48.344 --> 01:36:50.345
Get your hands off me!

01:36:50.847 --> 01:36:52.764
I'm leaving here.

01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:55.684
I need a peaceful environment
to do my writing in.

01:36:59.772 --> 01:37:01.899
Could you get me a towel, please?

01:37:04.027 --> 01:37:05.777
Jesus. Fuck.

01:37:06.821 --> 01:37:08.489
-Are you wet? Did you get wet?
-I'm fine.

01:37:08.573 --> 01:37:09.490
Okay.

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:16.330
AUGUSTEN: Like a sheep or a dog
that can predict an earthquake,

01:37:16.414 --> 01:37:19.583
I've always been able to sense
when my mother is about to go crazy.

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:23.253
Her eyes burn electric.
Her body gives off a metallic scent.

01:37:23.338 --> 01:37:26.924
She stops sleeping and starts developing
a taste for certain foods

01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:28.800
like toothpaste sandwiches.

01:37:32.138 --> 01:37:35.766
But journal, I think the worst is over.
I really do.

01:37:36.768 --> 01:37:40.646
Hospitals make you better.
My mother is going to get better.

01:37:40.939 --> 01:37:42.940
Dorothy's gone. She took everything.

01:37:43.024 --> 01:37:46.193
I don't wanna be alone
so you're moving back in with me.

01:37:53.868 --> 01:37:55.077
She's gone?

01:37:56.746 --> 01:37:58.830
Just you and me, baby. Come here.

01:38:10.552 --> 01:38:12.261
Augusten, hug back.

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:36.577
Could you make me some tea, sweetheart?

01:38:37.036 --> 01:38:38.245
Sure.

01:38:40.206 --> 01:38:43.333
Did I tell you I had a poem accepted
by Yankee Magazine?

01:38:45.169 --> 01:38:46.461
Really?

01:38:47.463 --> 01:38:48.630
That's great.

01:38:53.428 --> 01:38:54.553
Mom, what are you doing?

01:38:54.637 --> 01:38:59.349
Oh, I'm decoupaging my rejection letters
on top of the table here.

01:39:01.311 --> 01:39:02.519
Why?

01:39:03.354 --> 01:39:07.399
Well, I want a daily reminder of
my artistic journey when I become famous.

01:39:08.985 --> 01:39:10.527
This'll keep me humble.

01:39:16.868 --> 01:39:20.787
Mom, why did you mix your pills
with Dorothy's medicine?

01:39:21.664 --> 01:39:24.082
Dr. Finch says that's what made you sick.

01:39:25.043 --> 01:39:27.544
I'd rather not talk about that right now.

01:39:28.046 --> 01:39:31.632
This whole episode's been
very intense for me.

01:39:31.716 --> 01:39:34.676
But I do believe that may have been
my last psychotic episode.

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:38.180
I think I finally broke through
to my creative unconscious.

01:39:44.228 --> 01:39:46.396
Did Dorothy take all the cups, too?

01:39:47.732 --> 01:39:49.232
She's such a bitch.

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:51.777
Oh, no, no. They're out back on the lawn.

01:40:32.235 --> 01:40:34.361
What the fuck have you been up to?

01:40:35.571 --> 01:40:38.031
Giving my worldly possessions
a moon bath.

01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:42.619
Anything the doctor's touched,
anything he's looked at,

01:40:42.704 --> 01:40:45.038
needs to be sterilized by the night.

01:40:46.249 --> 01:40:48.417
I can't believe I just trusted you.

01:40:48.626 --> 01:40:51.002
You have to trust me. I'm your mother.

01:40:51.087 --> 01:40:53.922
And honestly, Augusten, I worry about you.

01:40:54.549 --> 01:40:56.800
I disapprove of your choices.

01:40:58.094 --> 01:41:00.095
I haven't had a choice!

01:41:01.389 --> 01:41:03.765
You did when you wrote this, didn't you?

01:41:09.897 --> 01:41:13.066
-You read my journal?
-Don't try and compete with me, Augusten.

01:41:13.151 --> 01:41:16.027
If you move back in with me, I won't allow it.

01:41:16.404 --> 01:41:18.071
You'll only get hurt.

01:41:19.490 --> 01:41:20.907
When I become a very famous woman,

01:41:20.992 --> 01:41:22.826
they'll write that I had a son
who is a writer, too,

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:26.621
who doesn't compare to my brilliance.
I want more for you than that.

01:41:29.625 --> 01:41:31.501
Did you mix your pills again?

01:41:31.961 --> 01:41:33.420
Are you judging me?

01:41:36.507 --> 01:41:37.966
Where are you going?

01:41:39.635 --> 01:41:43.722
Are you gonna call the doctor?
That bastard! He took my money!

01:41:45.433 --> 01:41:48.310
I won't be taken advantage of again.
ls that clear?

01:41:51.814 --> 01:41:53.482
What are you doing in there?

01:41:53.524 --> 01:41:54.816
Let me in!

01:41:55.777 --> 01:41:57.569
Are you calling the doctor?

01:41:57.653 --> 01:41:58.653
(PHONE RINGING)

01:41:59.614 --> 01:42:01.907
(SIREN WAILING)

01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:06.036
MAN ON RADIO: Neighbors reporting
domestic disturbance...

01:42:08.623 --> 01:42:10.791
-Good evening, ma'am...
-Get off of my property!

01:42:10.875 --> 01:42:13.794
Don't you dare tell me what to do, not ever!
You understand me?

01:42:13.878 --> 01:42:15.962
-Ma'am, you need to calm down...
-Fuck you!

01:42:16.047 --> 01:42:18.298
I will not be stifled in my own home!

01:42:20.468 --> 01:42:24.888
-Hope, Hope. It's Augusten.
-You are the goddamn devil! You are a Nazi!

01:42:26.432 --> 01:42:29.768
My mom's gone crazy again
and I need your help.

01:42:30.353 --> 01:42:32.020
HOPE: We need Dad.

01:42:34.232 --> 01:42:35.982
Finch gave her a sedative.

01:42:39.362 --> 01:42:41.404
I like watching her sleep.

01:42:43.616 --> 01:42:45.617
She looks like she's dead.

01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:50.705
Maybe she's finally at peace.

01:42:52.375 --> 01:42:55.919
None of us'll ever be at peace,

01:42:55.962 --> 01:43:00.966
until Finch and every bad seed
spawned from Finch

01:43:03.177 --> 01:43:04.678
is dead.

01:43:08.432 --> 01:43:10.058
You sound crazy.

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.896
Come on, let's go to bed.

01:44:23.507 --> 01:44:24.758
AGNES: Neil?

01:44:29.764 --> 01:44:30.931
Neil?

01:44:32.850 --> 01:44:35.352
-What are you doing, son?
-Shut up!

01:44:35.686 --> 01:44:37.103
I'm not your son!

01:44:37.688 --> 01:44:39.564
What in the hell is going on?

01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:47.364
It's all right.

01:45:07.259 --> 01:45:08.510
Neil.

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:10.553
(NEIL SOBBING)

01:45:12.431 --> 01:45:13.431
Neil.

01:45:15.893 --> 01:45:16.893
Neil!

01:45:40.251 --> 01:45:42.377
-Where did he go?
-Away.

01:45:42.712 --> 01:45:45.088
Why don't we ever have any relish
in this house?

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:46.214
What happened?

01:45:46.257 --> 01:45:48.591
Lt was a family situation. Lt's been handled.

01:45:48.634 --> 01:45:51.177
Natalie, you have to tell me, okay?

01:45:51.679 --> 01:45:53.513
Where did Bookman go?

01:46:33.721 --> 01:46:35.013
NATALIE: Where the fuck are you?

01:46:35.639 --> 01:46:37.140
I needed to get away.

01:46:38.434 --> 01:46:40.101
My father's very upset with you.

01:46:40.144 --> 01:46:43.146
He feels like you're taking your mother's
side in this and he needs your support

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:46.191
because he wants to have her committed
for good to a hospital.

01:46:46.275 --> 01:46:48.443
I don't think she needs to be committed.

01:46:53.157 --> 01:46:55.909
-Look, where are you? We'll come get you.
-Okay.

01:46:56.619 --> 01:46:58.161
Do you have a pen?

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.330
Yeah.

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.083
Okay, tell me where you are.

01:47:03.167 --> 01:47:06.169
I'll tell you where I'll be tomorrow at noon.

01:47:07.171 --> 01:47:08.671
The bus station.

01:47:11.050 --> 01:47:12.675
I'm going to New York.

01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:16.805
You're coming with me.

01:47:19.517 --> 01:47:21.684
We gotta get away from them, Nat.

01:47:22.478 --> 01:47:24.854
Your family, my mother.

01:47:25.397 --> 01:47:28.191
It's the only way that
we can have a normal life.

01:47:30.736 --> 01:47:32.695
What's going on?

01:47:35.491 --> 01:47:38.034
What are we gonna do
in New York, Augusten?

01:47:39.578 --> 01:47:42.539
Our only skills are restraining psychotics.

01:47:48.546 --> 01:47:49.629
I'll write.

01:47:50.881 --> 01:47:55.301
And I'll get a job so you can go to school.

01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:57.887
I'll support us.

01:48:03.227 --> 01:48:05.103
I'm afraid, Augusten.

01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:11.151
Me, too.

01:48:13.404 --> 01:48:15.113
But we can do this.

01:48:18.033 --> 01:48:19.450
We have to.

01:48:33.716 --> 01:48:36.134
Did a woman come in here by herself?

01:49:01.368 --> 01:49:02.952
Can I take your order?

01:49:03.704 --> 01:49:07.373
Yes, I'd like a TaB

01:49:07.458 --> 01:49:09.959
and a slice of key lime pie.

01:49:11.712 --> 01:49:13.713
Oh, nothing for me, thanks.

01:49:16.217 --> 01:49:18.509
Aren't you hungry? You look skinny.

01:49:19.929 --> 01:49:20.970
You really should eat something.

01:49:21.013 --> 01:49:23.806
Don't pull that maternal crap
with me now, Mom.

01:49:26.268 --> 01:49:27.894
It's too late for that.

01:49:29.188 --> 01:49:31.231
No, it's not too late.

01:49:32.858 --> 01:49:37.070
We can find a house together
where we both can write.

01:49:37.696 --> 01:49:39.364
We can start over.

01:49:39.949 --> 01:49:41.658
I am starting over.

01:49:42.993 --> 01:49:44.410
Ln New York.

01:49:48.874 --> 01:49:53.086
Really? Well, how are you gonna
make that work, Augusten?

01:49:53.379 --> 01:49:55.255
You've no formal education,

01:49:55.339 --> 01:49:59.092
no money, no furniture, no friends.

01:50:01.637 --> 01:50:04.889
Yeah, well, could be worse.

01:50:06.267 --> 01:50:08.351
Could be going to a prom.

01:50:14.275 --> 01:50:16.442
Why did you come here then?

01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:21.698
To say goodbye to you.

01:51:02.781 --> 01:51:05.325
Did you pack enough warm clothes?

01:51:14.043 --> 01:51:15.126
Yeah.

01:51:40.778 --> 01:51:42.195
I'm gonna be okay.

01:52:39.461 --> 01:52:41.337
Natalie's not coming.

01:52:43.882 --> 01:52:46.259
I told her I'd deal with you.

01:52:50.889 --> 01:52:53.057
Don't try to stop me, Agnes.

01:52:53.976 --> 01:52:55.309
I'm going.

01:53:05.737 --> 01:53:07.530
I'm gonna miss you.

01:53:10.909 --> 01:53:12.577
I'll miss you, too.

01:53:16.623 --> 01:53:23.546
You're the best son a mom could ever want.

01:53:28.886 --> 01:53:30.845
You need to know that.

01:53:56.288 --> 01:53:57.663
Oh, my God.

01:53:58.582 --> 01:54:01.834
Agnes, there's a lot of money in here.

01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:07.423
Penny here, a dime there.

01:54:10.552 --> 01:54:12.053
Lt adds up.

01:54:14.598 --> 01:54:18.184
The doctor doesn't know I have it,
of course. No one does.

01:54:25.317 --> 01:54:29.779
You know, this morning the IRS came again

01:54:32.115 --> 01:54:34.283
and I almost gave it to them.

01:54:35.869 --> 01:54:37.828
And then I thought, no.

01:54:39.831 --> 01:54:44.418
For once in my life
I'm going to invest wisely.

01:54:51.093 --> 01:54:54.845
When you write a book, you send me a copy.

01:55:11.321 --> 01:55:13.406
Goodbye, my sweet boy.

01:55:24.918 --> 01:55:26.043
Agnes?

01:55:30.924 --> 01:55:32.758
What are you gonna do now?

01:55:35.137 --> 01:55:36.679
I don't know.

01:55:39.308 --> 01:55:41.684
Maybe I'll take down the Christmas tree.
