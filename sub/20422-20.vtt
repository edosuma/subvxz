00:09.450 --> 00:11.490
It's been a long time.

00:13.620 --> 00:15.180
Londark!

01:49.280 --> 01:53.000
What are you doing here, Londark?

01:53.290 --> 01:55.640
Don't make that scary face.

01:56.100 --> 01:59.010
There's no need for us to fight now...

01:59.450 --> 02:02.010
As long as you do not interfere.

02:02.370 --> 02:06.520
Do you know what you're doing?

02:06.770 --> 02:08.710
I do.

02:08.710 --> 02:12.520
I'm doing a job and getting paid,

02:13.230 --> 02:16.730
guiding and protecting this iron train.

02:17.290 --> 02:19.410
And what of the result?

02:19.410 --> 02:20.700
Result?

02:20.700 --> 02:24.460
There's nothing about that in my manual.

02:24.910 --> 02:26.650
<i>Inferno Strike!</i>

02:30.830 --> 02:32.090
Of course there isn't.

02:32.090 --> 02:37.590
I never received a manual for this world.

02:37.630 --> 02:43.600
<b>Birthday Song</b>

02:40.230 --> 02:41.460
Birthday Song.

02:46.590 --> 02:52.110
You believe there's a possibility of war 
with People of the Land, Shiroe?

02:52.630 --> 02:56.150
I think the Round Table should 
consider the possibility.

02:56.650 --> 03:01.610
<i>We're in a world where there's 
a possibility of war breaking out.</i>

03:01.610 --> 03:06.160
<i>That's what Shiroe was trying to say then.</i>

03:06.850 --> 03:09.080
<i>How will each individual</i>

03:09.080 --> 03:11.870
<i>who lives in this world confront that possibility?</i>

03:11.870 --> 03:14.110
<i>That was his message.</i>

03:15.330 --> 03:16.600
Londark...

03:16.600 --> 03:20.760
Are you trying to spread war and 
chaos throughout the world?

03:20.760 --> 03:23.120
Not at all.

03:23.540 --> 03:26.350
The ones who might be thinking of doing that

03:26.350 --> 03:29.180
are the People of the Land 
who gave me this quest!

03:29.530 --> 03:32.100
And you're helping them!

03:32.730 --> 03:33.860
So,

03:35.470 --> 03:36.690
what of it?

03:37.050 --> 03:39.530
Many People of the Land will be lost!

03:39.830 --> 03:41.830
That's what they want.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.800
They fight because they want to.

03:43.800 --> 03:44.780
<i>Frost—</i>

03:51.090 --> 03:53.750
We can stop it before it starts!

03:54.230 --> 03:57.240
I've never heard about a quest like that!

03:58.500 --> 04:02.150
You can't do anything if it isn't a quest, Londark?

04:02.420 --> 04:04.350
Shut up, hypocrite.

04:04.350 --> 04:09.410
I wasn't... I wasn't invited to this world.

04:10.510 --> 04:14.020
I wasn't invited to this world.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.810
I'm useless.

04:18.360 --> 04:23.030
Did you pick from a dialogue box that said, 
"Will you go to another world? Y/N"?

04:23.710 --> 04:25.530
I didn't!

04:26.140 --> 04:29.410
I was forced to come here, and nobody asked me.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.130
You were invited, right?

04:32.130 --> 04:35.040
That's why you're so relaxed!

04:35.460 --> 04:36.430
No!

04:36.780 --> 04:40.260
None of us were invited.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.860
This world tried to do something 
to me that I didn't want,

04:43.860 --> 04:46.010
regardless of my feelings.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.760
So I'm going to do what I want to it.

unreasonable and crazy to them.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.720
Shut up!

06:36.820 --> 06:42.670
No one is asked at birth if they

Mizufa, it's over.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.400
Don't be stupid...

14:22.770 --> 14:25.190

17:34.990 --> 17:37.660
<i>But... But I'll sing.</i>

17:38.060 --> 17:40.290
<i>I know you.</i>

17:40.290 --> 17:42.560
<i>I know how you feel.</i>

17:42.910 --> 17:46.750
<i>Songs are prayers that are actually heard.</i>

17:48.400 --> 17:50.590
<i>I understand how you feel.</i>

17:50.590 --> 17:52.900
<i>When I sing, I feel the same way.</i>

17:53.310 --> 17:54.510
<i>Don't give in.</i>

17:54.510 --> 17:55.550
<i>Hang in there.</i>

17:56.070 --> 17:58.580
<i>That's what everyone was trying to tell me.</i>

17:59.900 --> 18:02.340
<i>I can't say that I'll become an artist.</i>

18:02.790 --> 18:07.400
<i>But I can promise I'll love music my whole life!</i>

18:08.710 --> 18:11.890
<i>Rudy longed to be an adventurer.</i>

18:11.890 --> 18:14.360
<i>It didn't matter whether he could be or not.</i>

18:14.360 --> 18:17.860
<i>He just wanted to fight what he saw as unreasonable.</i>

18:18.790 --> 18:22.740
<i>I didn't need to worry about whether I had talent.</i>

18:23.240 --> 18:25.910
<i>Rudy brought me close.</i>

18:25.910 --> 18:29.170
<i>He gave me my songs.</i>

18:32.010 --> 18:33.820
Isuzu!

18:33.820 --> 18:35.260
Miss Serara!

18:35.260 --> 18:36.510
It's all right.

18:36.510 --> 18:40.990
I searched all the buildings west 
of here with Wolfie's nose.

18:41.450 --> 18:44.820
All the People of the Land have evacuated.

18:44.820 --> 18:46.880
Get back, mister!

18:46.540 --> 18:49.340
<b>Party Chat 
Tohya 
Minori 
Isuzu 
Rundel Haus Code 
Serara 
Roe 2</b>

18:46.880 --> 18:47.750
Tohya...

18:47.750 --> 18:48.890
Shut up!

18:48.890 --> 18:50.910
You're still going to get in my way?

18:50.910 --> 18:53.870
This battle belongs to the Odyssey Knights!

18:51.150 --> 18:52.590
He's still fighting.

18:53.110 --> 18:55.360
Yeah, Tohya hasn't lost yet, either!

18:55.360 --> 18:57.210
He's near the river.

18:57.210 --> 18:58.190
He's close!

18:58.190 --> 19:00.950
Don't mess up until I get there, Tohya!

19:00.950 --> 19:02.860
I, Rundel Haus Code,

19:04.370 --> 19:06.620
will help you!

19:06.620 --> 19:08.220
I won't step down!

19:10.540 --> 19:15.300
I'm not going to give up on you guys!

19:16.100 --> 19:18.880
What does a kid like you know?

19:19.230 --> 19:21.180
If you don't stop,

19:21.180 --> 19:24.060
I'll rip you apart with my Onslaught!

19:24.060 --> 19:25.580
Then do it!

19:26.060 --> 19:28.490
But I'm not leaving!

19:28.490 --> 19:29.390
Tohya!

19:32.070 --> 19:34.650
This is the place where we die.

19:34.650 --> 19:37.210
Don't block our path to hell!

20:00.860 --> 20:01.950
Tohya...

20:02.420 --> 20:03.470
Give me a break!

20:05.500 --> 20:06.930
The place where you die?

20:08.680 --> 20:10.550
A path to hell?

20:11.270 --> 20:12.940
Miss Isuzu?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.200
Rudy...

20:15.720 --> 20:21.240
I want to fill this world with the 
sound of a forty-third song!

20:21.670 --> 20:25.200
I want to play the song I made for 
the first time in this world!

20:29.240 --> 20:30.210
<i>Because...</i>

20:30.740 --> 20:32.260
<i>This world...</i>

20:35.710 --> 20:39.670
<i>This world I've walked through with my friends...</i>

20:41.660 --> 20:42.800
<i>It isn't...</i>

20:43.350 --> 20:44.560
<i>It isn't...</i>

20:46.490 --> 20:49.720
<i>the path to hell!</i>

20:53.110 --> 20:57.760
<i>The sea wind, the asphalt...</i>

20:57.760 --> 21:00.970
<i>Once we're over the hill,</i>

21:00.970 --> 21:04.200
<i>we can see the next town.</i>

21:04.200 --> 21:08.490
<i>Our journey is just beginning.</i>

21:10.440 --> 21:16.770
<i>Plucking the strings on my little lute,</i>

21:16.770 --> 21:19.970
<i>I'll open up the window</i>

21:19.970 --> 21:24.010
<i>and begin again today.</i>

21:24.600 --> 21:32.580
<i>Even if you can't hear this song,</i>

21:32.580 --> 21:38.820
<i>even if you're locked inside this tiny world,</i>

21:38.820 --> 21:42.060
<i>it's okay</i>

21:42.060 --> 21:45.250
<i>because I'm here.</i>

21:45.250 --> 21:53.090
<i>I'll overwrite the yesterday 
that hurt your heart.</i>

21:53.090 --> 22:00.930
<i>I won't forget the shining rainbow I spread,</i>

22:00.930 --> 22:06.520
<i>and my hopes will become musical notes.</i>

22:06.520 --> 22:13.620
<i>I won't forget the shining promise I made with you.</i>

22:13.620 --> 22:21.100
<i>Even my cowardly lute is different today.</i>

24:05.540 --> 24:07.210
The journey is over.

24:07.210 --> 24:09.300
What were they able to do?

24:09.300 --> 24:11.220
Were they able to save anyone?

24:11.220 --> 24:12.990
Minori and the others still feel glum.

24:13.580 --> 24:17.190
Roe 2 entrusts them with a letter for Shiroe.

24:17.730 --> 24:21.800
Meanwhile, a new threat approaches Akihabara.

24:22.270 --> 24:29.940
<b>The Skylarks Take Flight</b>

24:22.410 --> 24:24.840
Next time: The Skylarks Take Flight.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.280
I have friends to run with me.
