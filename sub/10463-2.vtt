WEBVTT

00:04.411 --> 00:06.129
I was wrong about you, wasn't I?

00:07.873 --> 00:09.507
I mean, look at you.

00:10.166 --> 00:11.885
You're all grown up.

00:13.712 --> 00:15.680
What a surprise.

00:16.548 --> 00:18.558
So grown up.

00:21.136 --> 00:23.855
Has anyone ever told you
you're irresistible?

00:27.350 --> 00:29.360
Not... Not really.

00:32.063 --> 00:35.241
You are just the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

00:35.483 --> 00:37.535
I just want to eat you up.

00:38.028 --> 00:40.121
Such a big boy.

00:40.488 --> 00:42.665
Such a big boy.

00:43.074 --> 00:45.293
Such a big, big boy.

00:45.535 --> 00:46.887
Yes, you are.

00:46.911 --> 00:48.588
Yes, you are.

00:49.623 --> 00:51.684
You know, I've really got
things under control here,

00:51.708 --> 00:53.352
so if there's something
you need to do...

00:53.376 --> 00:54.478
No.

00:54.502 --> 00:57.096
I'm happy to make myself,
you know, available,

00:57.213 --> 01:00.016
lend you a hand or whatever just till
you get into the swing of things here.

01:00.425 --> 01:01.893
It's been over two
and a half weeks.

01:02.177 --> 01:03.070
Has it?

01:03.094 --> 01:04.729
Aren't you going to
be late for school?

01:04.888 --> 01:07.700
I'm at the point now where I can
pretty much set my own schedule,

01:07.724 --> 01:08.784
more or less.

01:08.808 --> 01:10.077
Really?

01:10.101 --> 01:11.454
I don't remember
10th grade being...

01:11.478 --> 01:12.538
11th.

01:12.562 --> 01:14.572
11th grade being like that.

01:15.899 --> 01:17.700
You don't want to
miss your ride.

01:17.901 --> 01:19.869
Look how messy you are.

01:19.986 --> 01:21.172
Look how messy you are.

01:21.196 --> 01:23.382
You know, he's very
picky about his bath.

01:23.406 --> 01:24.916
I should probably show you.

01:27.786 --> 01:30.254
They never carry any books.
You ever notice that?

01:30.705 --> 01:33.383
We walk around like two
librarians all the time.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.679
Please. You're, like, obsessed
with Nina DiMayo and her escorts.

01:42.384 --> 01:43.778
I guess not carrying any books

01:43.802 --> 01:45.812
leaves your hands free
to do other things.

01:49.933 --> 01:51.526
Why couldn't that be us?

01:51.893 --> 01:55.331
How about no car, no guys,

01:55.355 --> 01:57.782
no cigarettes, no attitude?

01:58.483 --> 02:00.285
We could bum some cigarettes.

02:00.777 --> 02:01.995
Yeah.

02:02.696 --> 02:05.206
Are you going to tell me what
you did on number seven or not?

02:05.323 --> 02:07.125
Think of the 80-and-dying test.

02:07.409 --> 02:09.261
When you're 80 and dying, what
are you going to look back on

02:09.285 --> 02:10.669
and regret not doing?

02:12.455 --> 02:14.350
I swear to you getting the
right answer on number seven

02:14.374 --> 02:16.009
is not going to be on the list.

02:23.508 --> 02:26.019
Let's leave our books in our
lockers today, what do you say?

02:29.931 --> 02:31.357
What are you doing?

02:32.142 --> 02:33.735
Connect-the-dots.

02:34.978 --> 02:37.447
A few more freckles and we've
got the Oakland Bay Bridge.

02:41.985 --> 02:43.619
Uh-oh. Damn.

02:43.653 --> 02:44.714
What?

02:44.738 --> 02:46.664
- Where are you going?
- Deadline.

02:47.365 --> 02:48.750
You know how it is.

02:50.577 --> 02:52.503
Second thought, maybe you don't.

02:54.289 --> 02:57.435
Hey, you said the shelves
would take two weeks, tops.

02:57.459 --> 03:00.479
That's before I had incentive
to make the job last.

03:00.503 --> 03:01.647
Charlie...

03:01.671 --> 03:03.222
Charlie, I got to work.

03:04.090 --> 03:08.362
500 words on "The proliferation of
Japanese noodle restaurants in the city."

03:08.386 --> 03:09.896
I hadn't noticed.

03:10.180 --> 03:12.273
Due at five on the dot.

03:13.183 --> 03:14.618
So you'll be 15 minutes late.

03:14.642 --> 03:16.328
Your editor will understand.

03:16.352 --> 03:17.612
Fifteen, huh?

03:17.937 --> 03:19.614
I could make it 10.

03:20.273 --> 03:22.658
Oh, God, you are young.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:35.205 --> 03:36.640
It's not like some
weird sexual thing

03:36.664 --> 03:37.767
that I should be
interested in her

03:37.791 --> 03:40.343
just because she's taking
care of my brother, is it?

03:40.502 --> 03:43.481
You realize that this
paper's due in three days?

03:43.505 --> 03:44.680
Yeah.

03:45.090 --> 03:47.234
See, I get this funny pain thing

03:47.258 --> 03:49.102
in my stomach
whenever I see her.

03:49.177 --> 03:50.603
"Funny pain thing?"

03:50.637 --> 03:52.021
You're gone, man.

03:52.472 --> 03:54.200
Okay, so she's older, a little,

03:54.224 --> 03:55.983
which is tough but
not impossible.

03:56.351 --> 03:58.120
I definitely have to
make the first move.

03:58.144 --> 03:59.246
Any suggestions?

03:59.270 --> 04:00.915
Yeah. Snap out of it, okay?

04:00.939 --> 04:02.041
Do you have any clue

04:02.065 --> 04:05.086
how to analyze the poem
<i>To His Coy Mistress</i>

04:05.110 --> 04:06.587
in terms of its theme, language,

04:06.611 --> 04:08.579
metaphor, imagery, and meter?

04:09.823 --> 04:10.883
Not off the top of my head.

04:10.907 --> 04:11.967
Well, you'd better
figure it out,

04:11.991 --> 04:13.219
'cause if you spend
the next three days

04:13.243 --> 04:15.554
mooning over this babysitter
and blow this paper

04:15.578 --> 04:16.971
and get put on
academic probation

04:16.995 --> 04:18.057
and get benched from the team

04:18.081 --> 04:19.475
and we lose another game,

04:19.499 --> 04:21.769
me and 10 other guys are
gonna come to your house

04:21.793 --> 04:24.021
and do a job on your
face so that no girl

04:24.045 --> 04:25.648
will ever find you
attractive again.

04:25.672 --> 04:26.889
Okay?

04:28.049 --> 04:29.985
There's no point in
threatening a man in love.

04:30.009 --> 04:31.269
Hopeless!

04:32.554 --> 04:33.729
Bay,

04:34.139 --> 04:36.357
what's Uncle Kurt's
wife's name again?

04:37.225 --> 04:38.526
The new one.

04:39.102 --> 04:40.862
The one he moved to France for?

04:42.897 --> 04:44.157
Marnie.

04:44.774 --> 04:45.751
Marie.

04:45.775 --> 04:47.086
Something like that.

04:47.110 --> 04:48.953
What about Nana and Papa?

04:49.195 --> 04:50.496
When were they born?

04:50.613 --> 04:51.956
What is this, Claud?

04:52.407 --> 04:54.584
We're supposed to do
our family trees,

04:54.617 --> 04:56.929
like with cut-out
construction paper,

04:56.953 --> 04:58.337
you know, all that?

04:59.706 --> 05:01.475
So, Nana and Papa?

05:01.499 --> 05:02.758
Huh?

05:03.501 --> 05:04.969
Oh. Uh...

05:06.171 --> 05:08.806
Nana died in '86,

05:09.048 --> 05:10.234
same year as Grandma Jane.

05:10.258 --> 05:11.642
Papa was in, like,

05:12.385 --> 05:13.603
'89.

05:14.345 --> 05:15.906
They were both 70-something.

05:15.930 --> 05:17.491
I don't know. Can't
you do the math?

05:17.515 --> 05:18.858
What about Grandpa?

05:20.018 --> 05:21.486
Last one, I promise.

05:22.103 --> 05:23.321
Grandpa Jack.

05:23.688 --> 05:24.957
When was he born?

05:24.981 --> 05:26.574
I don't know, Claud.

05:27.233 --> 05:28.618
Honest, I don't.

05:28.735 --> 05:31.454
Mom was 10 when he took off.
She never talked about him.

05:31.821 --> 05:34.582
No one's heard from him since, like,
the Eisenhower administration.

05:35.950 --> 05:37.084
But he's alive.

05:37.577 --> 05:39.629
I mean, no one knows
that he isn't alive.

05:40.163 --> 05:42.048
We're real low on
fabric softener.

05:44.792 --> 05:46.260
He could be alive.

05:47.378 --> 05:48.721
You all right, Bailey?

05:50.715 --> 05:52.058
Hello.

05:52.842 --> 05:54.185
Hello.

05:55.345 --> 05:56.906
So we take the
Filmore bus to Geary

05:56.930 --> 05:58.689
and the Geary bus to Castro?

05:58.806 --> 06:00.733
The Castro line takes forever.

06:00.850 --> 06:02.077
We get anything from Mr. Graham?

06:02.101 --> 06:03.037
I don't know. Can I...

06:03.061 --> 06:04.955
He was going to send me the monthly
statement from the estate.

06:04.979 --> 06:06.280
Can I borrow 10 bucks?

06:06.356 --> 06:07.333
What for?

06:07.357 --> 06:10.034
Cab fare, in case we're out
past the bus' last run.

06:10.151 --> 06:12.671
Cab fare? The library's
like three blocks away.

06:12.695 --> 06:15.122
We're kind of not
going to the library.

06:15.657 --> 06:17.134
There's this party
we heard about.

06:17.158 --> 06:19.460
It's supposed to be this huge blowout.
We're gonna crash.

06:20.411 --> 06:22.171
Thanks, Charlie.

06:24.248 --> 06:25.517
Look, if my mom calls,

06:25.541 --> 06:27.760
could you tell that we
did go to the library?

06:27.835 --> 06:28.896
Sure thing.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.179
Cool.

06:31.798 --> 06:33.609
Actually, that'll
only work till nine.

06:33.633 --> 06:34.818
After nine, could you tell her

06:34.842 --> 06:36.978
that we went down to the
corner to get some pizza?

06:37.095 --> 06:37.988
No problem.

06:38.012 --> 06:39.647
Great. See you later.

06:41.849 --> 06:43.535
Any time after 10,
could you tell her

06:43.559 --> 06:44.954
that I was so fried
from studying

06:44.978 --> 06:46.705
that I kind of crashed
on Julia's bed

06:46.729 --> 06:48.707
and you don't think it's such
a good idea to wake me up?

06:48.731 --> 06:49.917
He's got us covered, Lib.

06:49.941 --> 06:51.909
I've got you covered, Lib.
Have fun.

06:58.908 --> 07:00.219
Hey, Char,

07:00.243 --> 07:01.752
you ever been with
an older woman?

07:02.412 --> 07:03.681
Why? Why do you want to know?

07:03.705 --> 07:04.880
I'm just curious.

07:05.832 --> 07:06.892
That's all.

07:06.916 --> 07:08.301
Uh, yeah.

07:08.334 --> 07:09.635
Sure I have.

07:11.921 --> 07:13.180
What's it like?

07:14.590 --> 07:15.901
It's great.

07:15.925 --> 07:17.152
Older women are great.

07:17.176 --> 07:18.477
So you don't...

07:19.012 --> 07:21.814
think that an age difference
is necessarily a big problem?

07:22.640 --> 07:24.442
Nah. You kidding me?

07:24.559 --> 07:26.152
It can work in your favor.

07:26.519 --> 07:29.113
All that stuff about women
peaking later than guys.

07:29.772 --> 07:31.574
So how do you get something
like that going?

07:33.693 --> 07:35.161
The big thing is...

07:37.530 --> 07:39.081
you've got to let them know...

07:41.868 --> 07:43.252
you're not so young

07:43.453 --> 07:45.630
you can't talk to them about
stuff they're interested in.

07:46.289 --> 07:47.182
What do you mean?

07:47.206 --> 07:48.591
Say, she's, like...

07:49.083 --> 07:50.468
I don't know,

07:50.918 --> 07:52.303
a restaurant critic.

07:52.545 --> 07:53.888
A restaurant critic?

07:54.380 --> 07:55.723
She's got all these books

07:56.341 --> 07:57.568
about cooking and
food and stuff,

07:57.592 --> 07:58.934
so you say something like,

07:59.635 --> 08:01.238
"You know, I've never
understood the difference

08:01.262 --> 08:03.648
between Szechuan and
Mandarin cuisine."

08:04.766 --> 08:07.151
So you ask her something
she knows about.

08:07.643 --> 08:09.320
What is she, a
senior or something?

08:10.980 --> 08:12.698
Uh... Yeah.

08:15.860 --> 08:17.453
Go for it, man.

08:23.493 --> 08:25.670
Maybe I should check to
see if my mom called.

08:26.204 --> 08:27.630
Lib, would you relax?

08:30.792 --> 08:32.677
We can't sit here
forever, you know.

08:33.336 --> 08:34.605
I mean, we didn't
take three buses

08:34.629 --> 08:35.856
to sit on the hood of a Pontiac

08:35.880 --> 08:37.390
and watch other people have fun.

08:39.092 --> 08:40.652
People are going to
think we're major geeks

08:40.676 --> 08:42.571
if we go in looking like
we don't know anyone.

08:42.595 --> 08:43.895
Okay.

08:43.929 --> 08:45.815
So we go in there saying, like,

08:45.932 --> 08:47.233
"Has anyone seen David?"

08:48.267 --> 08:49.485
Who's that?

08:49.977 --> 08:51.705
Well, there's five
Davids in Soc alone.

08:51.729 --> 08:53.447
There's got to be
at least one here.

08:54.607 --> 08:55.709
What do you say?

08:55.733 --> 08:57.326
Has anyone seen David?

08:58.361 --> 09:00.547
That's not much of a
conversation starter.

09:00.571 --> 09:02.623
No, but it's a plan.

09:06.994 --> 09:08.212
Kirsten?

09:08.287 --> 09:10.057
Owen was playing with my
key ring out here today

09:10.081 --> 09:12.007
and he must've dropped
it somewhere.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.552
I didn't realize it until now.

09:15.420 --> 09:16.679
Want some help?

09:16.754 --> 09:18.055
Yeah. Thanks.

09:19.173 --> 09:21.142
Jeez, it's cold out
here, isn't it?

09:21.884 --> 09:23.070
You want my sweater?

09:23.094 --> 09:24.029
No.

09:24.053 --> 09:25.479
Oh, come on. Don't be silly.
Take it.

09:32.103 --> 09:33.279
Thanks.

09:34.564 --> 09:35.948
Okay, uh...

09:36.190 --> 09:38.877
The thing to do is divide the
backyard into quadrants.

09:38.901 --> 09:40.546
Sounds like you've
done this before.

09:40.570 --> 09:41.547
Yeah?

09:41.571 --> 09:44.091
Well, once I got into a fistfight with
Tommy Slovoto from up the street,

09:44.115 --> 09:45.583
and he knocked my
front tooth out.

09:45.741 --> 09:47.793
I spent, like, a whole day
back here trying to find it.

09:48.035 --> 09:49.545
Which one was it?

09:52.415 --> 09:53.684
It's kind of hard to believe

09:53.708 --> 09:56.343
that smile isn't 100
percent natural.

10:01.007 --> 10:02.109
Found them.

10:02.133 --> 10:03.434
Great.

10:04.010 --> 10:05.311
Thanks.

10:09.682 --> 10:10.941
Well...

10:11.225 --> 10:12.651
Night.

10:13.060 --> 10:14.403
Night.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.871
What are you so happy about?

10:24.280 --> 10:25.498
Nothing.

10:26.282 --> 10:28.250
I decided I'm going to find him.

10:28.784 --> 10:30.169
Grandpa Jack.

10:32.705 --> 10:34.006
I'm going to find him.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.520
You're going to find him?

10:38.544 --> 10:40.012
Uh-huh.

10:40.213 --> 10:41.482
You're going to go out
and look for him?

10:41.506 --> 10:42.399
Yep.

10:42.423 --> 10:43.808
And you know how to do that?

10:43.841 --> 10:46.143
Of course not. I'm
in the fifth grade.

10:46.219 --> 10:47.561
I'll just get some help.

10:47.970 --> 10:48.906
The thing is, Claud,

10:48.930 --> 10:50.981
He's been missing
for, like, 30 years.

10:51.098 --> 10:52.358
He could be dead.

10:52.391 --> 10:54.119
Or maybe he doesn't
really want to be found.

10:54.143 --> 10:56.538
Or maybe he's waiting for
someone to want to find him.

10:56.562 --> 10:58.989
I just don't think you should
get your hopes up, Claud.

11:00.858 --> 11:02.284
Did you ever look for him?

11:02.860 --> 11:05.412
Did you ever ask any
questions about him at all?

11:06.697 --> 11:07.716
Did you?

11:07.740 --> 11:09.166
Well, no, but...

11:09.408 --> 11:11.085
There wasn't much point.

11:11.327 --> 11:12.670
Jeez.

11:13.204 --> 11:14.681
I'd hate to think what
would happen to me

11:14.705 --> 11:16.507
if I ended up missing
for 30 years.

11:16.999 --> 11:18.384
Claudia...

11:18.668 --> 11:20.844
Well, I'm going to find him.

11:31.806 --> 11:33.450
"That night, the
princess was at dinner

11:33.474 --> 11:36.527
with her father, the king,
and his royal court

11:36.686 --> 11:38.914
when there came a strange
knocking on the door

11:38.938 --> 11:42.616
and a voice cried out,
'Princess, Princess! Let me in!'

11:43.025 --> 11:45.087
The princess ran to
see who it could be

11:45.111 --> 11:46.996
and was startled
to see the frog."

11:49.407 --> 11:51.051
Still reading to
him in his sleep?

11:51.075 --> 11:52.418
He can hear me.

11:52.868 --> 11:54.420
It's amazing, huh?

11:54.996 --> 11:57.923
I've always been fascinated
by the unconscious mind.

11:58.457 --> 12:00.467
You mean the subconscious mind.

12:01.002 --> 12:02.469
Exactly.

12:02.545 --> 12:05.973
I had no idea you were interested
in psychology, Bailey.

12:06.841 --> 12:08.934
Hmm, I dabble.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.979
So I know how important it is

12:13.222 --> 12:16.233
to stimulate Owen's imagination.

12:17.226 --> 12:19.746
Little boys with imaginations
grow up to be men

12:19.770 --> 12:22.364
who are creative
and resourceful.

12:24.025 --> 12:26.410
Men I find very, very sexy.

12:29.071 --> 12:30.372
I, uh...

12:31.574 --> 12:33.792
had an imaginary friend
when I was a kid.

12:34.118 --> 12:35.137
No kidding?

12:35.161 --> 12:37.921
That's supposed to be a
sign of real sensitivity.

12:38.456 --> 12:39.757
Really?

12:40.499 --> 12:41.800
Huh.

12:42.585 --> 12:45.304
Yeah. His name was Lloyd.

12:47.131 --> 12:49.516
Lloyd W. Loomis.

12:50.301 --> 12:51.852
Lloyd Loomis.

12:52.094 --> 12:53.228
Uh,

12:53.429 --> 12:55.240
I guess I must have
been pretty sensitive,

12:55.264 --> 12:57.534
because Lloyd and I
would spend hours

12:57.558 --> 12:59.735
just imagining together.

13:00.895 --> 13:02.237
What did you and
Lloyd talk about?

13:02.980 --> 13:04.448
Uh...

13:05.483 --> 13:07.534
baseball, mainly.

13:07.902 --> 13:09.745
Yeah, I wanted to
be a ballplayer,

13:10.279 --> 13:11.830
and Lloyd was living with me,

13:12.365 --> 13:13.499
under my bed,

13:13.699 --> 13:14.593
I think,

13:14.617 --> 13:17.586
and because his father,

13:18.788 --> 13:21.558
his father was a catcher

13:21.582 --> 13:23.810
for this minor league
farm team of the Giants,

13:23.834 --> 13:26.720
and so he was on the
road all the time and...

13:27.213 --> 13:28.472
So you took him in.

13:29.131 --> 13:30.891
Except during the off-season.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.237
Is that weird?

13:34.261 --> 13:35.646
No.

13:35.971 --> 13:39.233
Actually, it's a sign of a very
nurturing and caring person.

13:40.226 --> 13:41.402
Yeah.

13:42.186 --> 13:44.947
I'd lend him my
clothes and feed him

13:45.272 --> 13:47.908
and save him a place at
the table next to me.

13:50.820 --> 13:52.339
Why am I telling you this?

13:52.363 --> 13:53.622
What?

13:54.031 --> 13:55.499
I think it's wonderful.

13:58.744 --> 14:00.045
Claudia?

14:01.122 --> 14:02.548
You want to explain?

14:02.623 --> 14:04.976
Alan Tisk. Golden State
Private Investigations.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.135
We spoke.

14:06.502 --> 14:08.095
Nice to meet you, Mr. Tisk.

14:08.796 --> 14:10.305
I'll take it from here, Charlie.

14:10.381 --> 14:12.433
No, Claudia, you won't
"take it from here."

14:12.883 --> 14:14.486
You can't just call up
a private eye and...

14:14.510 --> 14:15.529
What's going on?

14:15.553 --> 14:17.521
Mr. Tisk and I are
going to find Grandpa.

14:18.472 --> 14:19.658
Jack Gordon.

14:19.682 --> 14:22.619
"Left his wife and daughter
approximately 30 years ago in Seattle.

14:22.643 --> 14:25.122
Brief stint in the US
Navy during WWII."

14:25.146 --> 14:26.280
Yup.

14:26.439 --> 14:27.624
That's all we know.

14:27.648 --> 14:29.241
You hired a private detective?

14:30.276 --> 14:32.828
30 years is a long
time to be missing.

14:33.070 --> 14:34.381
See, Claud? That's
what we told you.

14:34.405 --> 14:36.123
You're wasting the man's time.

14:37.575 --> 14:38.834
Am I?

14:39.368 --> 14:40.669
Never say die.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.389
I'm with you, Mr. Tisk.

14:42.413 --> 14:43.557
Good,

14:43.581 --> 14:45.308
then let's talk business.

14:45.332 --> 14:49.563
My retainer is $500
payable up front.

14:49.587 --> 14:50.647
Wow.

14:50.671 --> 14:52.806
My retainer didn't
cost nearly that much.

14:53.299 --> 14:56.477
I charge $100 an
hour plus expenses.

15:00.681 --> 15:02.316
Could we do this in, like...

15:02.808 --> 15:04.318
15 minutes?

15:06.771 --> 15:08.489
Can you recommend
somebody cheaper?

15:10.191 --> 15:11.784
How about a free tip.

15:13.652 --> 15:15.662
Try the Veterans Administration.

15:17.615 --> 15:19.875
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Tisk.

15:26.290 --> 15:27.809
You were sleeping in Civ.

15:27.833 --> 15:29.259
I was not.

15:29.502 --> 15:31.303
Yes, you were. I saw you.

15:31.420 --> 15:33.732
You were doing that
head-jerking thing.

15:33.756 --> 15:35.390
Shut up.

15:36.175 --> 15:37.444
Four hours sleep.

15:37.468 --> 15:40.270
It is a miracle that
I'm even standing.

15:41.639 --> 15:43.241
So what's the verdict?
Did you have fun?

15:43.265 --> 15:44.691
Yeah.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.870
I mean, yeah. Did you?

15:46.894 --> 15:48.278
Yeah, I guess.

15:48.771 --> 15:50.197
Sort of.

15:50.523 --> 15:51.917
It was kind of hard to
carry a conversation

15:51.941 --> 15:53.700
with the music cranking.

15:54.235 --> 15:57.088
So did you see me dancing with that
blond guy with the parrot tattoo?

15:57.112 --> 15:59.748
He was gorgeous.

16:00.282 --> 16:01.667
So do you like him?

16:01.826 --> 16:03.127
Like him?

16:03.911 --> 16:05.222
It's kind of hard to tell.

16:05.246 --> 16:06.765
I mean, he had his eyes
closed the whole time.

16:06.789 --> 16:08.350
He was sort of moaning
to the music.

16:08.374 --> 16:10.134
I don't really think
he knew I was...

16:10.209 --> 16:11.552
there.

16:16.715 --> 16:19.017
Weren't you guys at Bryan
Dennahan's last night?

16:19.134 --> 16:20.477
Yeah.

16:20.553 --> 16:22.271
Pretty happening, huh?

16:23.138 --> 16:25.408
I can't believe those bonehead
neighbors called the cops.

16:25.432 --> 16:27.285
I mean, the music
wasn't so loud.

16:27.309 --> 16:28.527
Totally.

16:28.894 --> 16:30.404
Quel drag.

16:30.980 --> 16:34.125
You know, uh, Jason's parents
are leaving town tomorrow,

16:34.149 --> 16:36.503
and him and Nina were thinking
about doing something,

16:36.527 --> 16:38.036
if you're interested.

16:38.654 --> 16:40.080
Great.

16:41.115 --> 16:42.291
Great.

16:45.035 --> 16:47.796
Okay, you guys. Everything
off your desks.

16:49.164 --> 16:51.434
I know you spent the evening
with King Lear last night,

16:51.458 --> 16:55.220
so let's see how much of
it actually sunk in, huh?

16:58.465 --> 17:01.059
Oh, you're beautiful
when you're angry.

17:01.552 --> 17:03.437
Papers on my desk
when you're done,

17:03.596 --> 17:06.106
and tonight's assignment
is to finish the play.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.584
I'm afraid I can't do that.

17:15.608 --> 17:16.917
I'm sure you can.

17:16.942 --> 17:19.619
Don't you have that kind of
information in a computer?

17:20.112 --> 17:23.165
Can't you just, like, type in his
name and tell me where he is?

17:23.198 --> 17:25.551
It's against our policy to give
out that kind of information

17:25.576 --> 17:27.419
to the general public.

17:28.037 --> 17:30.422
It's real important
that I find him.

17:31.290 --> 17:32.591
He owes me money.

17:35.127 --> 17:36.595
Look, Sergeant,

17:37.421 --> 17:38.597
I'm an orphan.

17:38.672 --> 17:40.682
My four brothers and
sisters are orphans.

17:41.216 --> 17:43.894
We're all alone and we have
no one to take care of us,

17:44.011 --> 17:46.647
and this man is our only
surviving grandparent,

17:46.805 --> 17:50.692
yet we have no idea where he
is or if he's alive, even.

17:53.145 --> 17:56.531
That's G-O-R-D-O-N.

17:57.358 --> 17:58.700
Gordon.

17:59.693 --> 18:01.922
You got to see this place.
Sea Ranch.

18:01.946 --> 18:03.757
All the houses are
built to fit, like,

18:03.781 --> 18:05.091
right into the environment.

18:05.115 --> 18:06.416
Oh, yeah?

18:10.287 --> 18:12.381
You think this skirt makes
my butt look too big?

18:12.748 --> 18:14.216
No. You look great.

18:14.708 --> 18:15.852
See, I'd love to do that,

18:15.876 --> 18:17.386
build houses like that.

18:17.586 --> 18:18.605
Like what?

18:18.629 --> 18:20.607
Environmentally, you
know, conscious

18:20.631 --> 18:22.067
like at Sea Ranch.

18:22.091 --> 18:23.026
Oh, yeah.

18:23.050 --> 18:25.394
See, I don't think
I know the place.

18:25.844 --> 18:27.437
I hate these events.

18:27.638 --> 18:31.368
The Bay Area Restaurateurs
Association Annual Cocktail Party

18:31.392 --> 18:33.360
and brown-nosing hour.

18:33.936 --> 18:34.955
You don't know how lucky you are

18:34.979 --> 18:36.655
not to get invited
to these things.

18:38.148 --> 18:40.701
Well, at least the
food's good, right?

18:42.778 --> 18:44.579
Hey, the shelves came out great.

18:45.322 --> 18:46.707
Yeah, didn't they?

18:51.161 --> 18:52.546
I don't know, Charlie.

18:52.955 --> 18:55.684
We're going to have to come
up with some new excuse

18:55.708 --> 18:57.634
for you being here
in the afternoon.

18:58.502 --> 18:59.688
Right.

18:59.712 --> 19:02.514
You know, my kitchen cabinets
could use some refinishing.

19:03.549 --> 19:04.985
Uh... These, uh...

19:05.009 --> 19:07.070
These next few weeks are
going to be kind of...

19:07.094 --> 19:09.114
I mean, I've got a
house painting thing

19:09.138 --> 19:10.365
over in Mill Valley, and...

19:10.389 --> 19:12.899
Okay, so how can we work this?

19:12.933 --> 19:14.860
I'll call you. You call me.

19:15.602 --> 19:17.279
Yeah, sure. It sounds good.

19:20.065 --> 19:21.616
Okay, Charlie.

19:25.362 --> 19:26.663
So,

19:27.573 --> 19:29.291
you sure we're square
on the shelves?

19:30.743 --> 19:32.085
Paid in full.

20:00.314 --> 20:01.490
Where you been?

20:01.565 --> 20:02.824
Out.

20:03.442 --> 20:05.035
What you doing?

20:05.694 --> 20:06.838
Are you throwing this away?

20:06.862 --> 20:08.789
MYOB, huh, Claud?

20:10.949 --> 20:12.918
Can I keep some of this
if you don't want it?

20:17.539 --> 20:19.341
Mom bought you this music box.

20:19.458 --> 20:21.927
It's kids' stuff, Claud.
I'm not a kid anymore.

20:22.044 --> 20:23.021
Yeah, right.

20:23.045 --> 20:24.773
Oh, I remember
when you got this.

20:24.797 --> 20:25.732
Claudia...

20:25.756 --> 20:28.401
"Presented to Julia Salinger, as the
promising freshman in the whole... "

20:28.425 --> 20:29.527
Do you mind?

20:29.551 --> 20:33.230
I don't feel like staring at a bunch of
lousy trophies every day of my life, okay?

20:33.972 --> 20:35.617
Whoa, what's gotten into you?

20:35.641 --> 20:37.150
Nothing.

20:37.935 --> 20:40.112
It's just like all
your violin stuff.

20:41.021 --> 20:43.249
I mean, all these dumb
plaques and awards

20:43.273 --> 20:44.876
and lessons and practicing

20:44.900 --> 20:45.960
and competitions
and everything...

20:45.984 --> 20:48.453
I mean, does that
really make you happy?

20:50.948 --> 20:53.333
Yeah. It does.

20:58.080 --> 21:01.341
Just whipped up some
spaghetti and meatballs.

21:02.209 --> 21:03.552
It's your favorite, right?

21:03.710 --> 21:05.053
Did I say that?

21:05.212 --> 21:06.596
Yeah, I guess.

21:08.048 --> 21:09.359
Dinner is served.

21:09.383 --> 21:10.819
Bailey made dinner?

21:10.843 --> 21:13.071
Can you believe they only give
you six meatballs in a can?

21:13.095 --> 21:14.521
Isn't that a rip-off?

21:15.264 --> 21:16.366
Is this seat taken?

21:16.390 --> 21:17.408
No.

21:17.432 --> 21:19.443
No! Uh...

21:21.103 --> 21:22.612
I was going to sit there...

21:23.313 --> 21:24.781
on that side...

21:25.023 --> 21:26.658
so that I could serve.

21:27.151 --> 21:28.577
Who cares where you sit?

21:28.944 --> 21:30.880
You've got a whole
bench to yourself.

21:30.904 --> 21:32.706
There's even enough
space for Lloyd.

21:32.906 --> 21:34.207
Lloyd?

21:34.366 --> 21:36.460
Bailey's imaginary
baseball-playing friend.

21:37.536 --> 21:38.429
Eat.

21:38.453 --> 21:40.306
What is this? You have an
imaginary friend, Bay?

21:40.330 --> 21:41.798
You weren't supposed
to mention that.

21:41.832 --> 21:43.184
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

21:43.208 --> 21:44.477
What position does he play?

21:44.501 --> 21:45.687
I'm really sorry.

21:45.711 --> 21:46.938
I didn't know you
hadn't told anybody.

21:46.962 --> 21:48.773
Imaginary friend, huh, Bailey?

21:48.797 --> 21:50.098
Named Lloyd?

21:50.465 --> 21:51.860
That's so cute.

21:51.884 --> 21:53.727
This is a fascinating insight.

21:55.888 --> 21:57.898
Okay, can we just
drop this, please?

21:58.682 --> 21:59.983
Sorry.

22:02.477 --> 22:03.496
What time is it?

22:03.520 --> 22:05.155
I've got to get to
the restaurant.

22:05.439 --> 22:07.115
Hey, you work too hard, Charlie.

22:07.816 --> 22:09.409
Yeah, right. You're one to talk.

22:10.068 --> 22:11.379
Could you pass the, uh...

22:11.403 --> 22:13.163
I could use a little vacation.

22:13.530 --> 22:16.166
I've been thinking about taking
some time, driving up the coast.

22:16.366 --> 22:17.677
No kidding. You ever
been to Sea Ranch?

22:17.701 --> 22:18.636
Cheese?

22:18.660 --> 22:20.180
- The place with all the houses?
 -Please?

22:20.204 --> 22:21.222
You know it?

22:21.246 --> 22:22.473
That is so beautiful.

22:22.497 --> 22:24.058
Isn't it? I love that place.

22:24.082 --> 22:26.436
The way every building complements
its natural surroundings.

22:26.460 --> 22:27.802
Right.

22:27.961 --> 22:29.888
Why can't they do that
here in the city?

22:30.255 --> 22:32.474
I know. I feel exactly
the same way.

22:33.175 --> 22:34.643
No kidding.

22:37.763 --> 22:40.023
It was really nice of you
guys to include me tonight.

22:40.474 --> 22:42.484
Well, sure. Of course.

22:42.517 --> 22:43.652
Absolutely.

22:43.769 --> 22:45.528
I didn't know your
brother was such a chef.

22:51.526 --> 22:53.578
Wait till you try
his tuna casserole.

22:55.030 --> 22:57.624
Well, it was sweet of him
to make such a fuss.

22:58.784 --> 23:00.418
He means well.

23:03.038 --> 23:05.382
Seems like he's always
thinking of other people.

23:06.959 --> 23:08.385
Yeah.

23:09.544 --> 23:11.221
All in all, he's, uh...

23:11.880 --> 23:13.640
a pretty great kid.

23:27.521 --> 23:29.572
I'm so sorry about
last night, Bailey.

23:30.273 --> 23:31.292
Forget about it.

23:31.316 --> 23:32.742
No, really. I mean it.

23:32.859 --> 23:35.838
It never occurred to me that you hadn't
told anybody you had an imaginary...

23:35.862 --> 23:37.247
It was a line.

23:37.322 --> 23:38.581
Okay?

23:39.074 --> 23:40.009
What?

23:40.033 --> 23:41.167
A line.

23:41.410 --> 23:42.669
I just made it up.

23:43.036 --> 23:44.296
You did?

23:48.083 --> 23:50.635
The thing is, I don't want
to play any more games.

23:52.087 --> 23:53.346
Kirsten...

23:55.716 --> 23:57.100
Salinger residence.

23:57.175 --> 23:58.194
Oh, hi.

23:58.218 --> 24:00.520
God, you're up and about early.

24:00.595 --> 24:02.105
No, that's okay. I already did.

24:02.431 --> 24:03.866
On my way to work.

24:03.890 --> 24:05.108
Last pair.

24:05.475 --> 24:07.036
"Obstructed view through the..."

24:07.060 --> 24:08.570
It was the best I could do.

24:09.938 --> 24:12.866
Well, who needs to see Gregorian
chants anyway, right?

24:14.317 --> 24:16.494
Charlie...

24:17.070 --> 24:19.706
So we'll hook up
after work tomorrow?

24:20.282 --> 24:21.708
Great.

24:25.162 --> 24:26.588
Julia.

24:27.622 --> 24:29.892
Guess we both have snooze
button syndrome, huh?

24:29.916 --> 24:31.176
Yeah, I guess.

24:31.835 --> 24:33.312
I thought I'd show
this in class.

24:33.336 --> 24:34.939
It's Peter Brooks'
film of <i>King Lear.</i>

24:34.963 --> 24:36.306
You seen it?

24:36.715 --> 24:37.891
Me neither.

24:37.966 --> 24:39.193
A date took me to
see it in college

24:39.217 --> 24:40.685
and I slept through
the whole thing.

24:41.011 --> 24:43.313
I'm hoping it was the
guy and not the movie.

24:44.222 --> 24:47.400
So, anything you want to say
about yesterday's quiz?

24:48.310 --> 24:50.278
You and Libby really
helped the curve.

24:50.687 --> 24:51.914
I gave you a 52.

24:51.938 --> 24:53.499
That's an F, Julia.

24:53.523 --> 24:55.376
Yeah, well, I guess I
didn't get the play.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.327
Shakespeare, you know.
It's hard.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.963
I'd believe you if you
said you hadn't read it,

24:58.987 --> 25:01.122
but not understand it? Come on.

25:01.281 --> 25:03.843
Last year, that paper
you wrote on <i>Othello,</i>

25:03.867 --> 25:05.219
that was much harder stuff.

25:05.243 --> 25:07.253
Okay, you're right.
I didn't read it.

25:08.121 --> 25:10.590
That F is going to pull down
the rest of your grade.

25:10.707 --> 25:12.634
That would be too
bad, don't you think?

25:14.503 --> 25:17.013
Look, you and Libby want to
earn some extra credit tonight?

25:17.297 --> 25:18.775
Give me five typed pages

25:18.799 --> 25:20.818
on what qualities make
Lear a tragic hero,

25:20.842 --> 25:22.278
I'll take the Fs off the books.

25:22.302 --> 25:23.603
Okay?

25:24.304 --> 25:25.730
Yikes. See you in class.

25:29.726 --> 25:31.319
Mr. Gordon?

25:31.686 --> 25:33.113
Jack Gordon?

25:33.313 --> 25:34.248
That's right.

25:34.272 --> 25:35.657
Can I do something for you?

25:36.483 --> 25:38.743
I'm, uh, selling
Girl Scout cookies.

25:39.152 --> 25:40.880
I thought you girls
wore a uniform.

25:40.904 --> 25:41.798
Oh,

25:41.822 --> 25:44.791
I ripped mine trying to get
my tree-climbing badge.

25:45.659 --> 25:47.053
So you want to buy some?

25:47.077 --> 25:48.420
They're three bucks a box.

25:48.870 --> 25:50.713
I don't think so.

25:51.289 --> 25:52.558
Thanks anyway.

25:52.582 --> 25:54.175
Why don't you try
Marilyn over there?

25:54.793 --> 25:56.437
Maybe you'd like
to buy your wife

25:56.461 --> 25:58.179
a box of her favorites.

26:00.006 --> 26:01.359
I haven't had a wife

26:01.383 --> 26:03.810
for more years than you've
been alive, my dear.

26:04.344 --> 26:05.279
Tell you what.

26:05.303 --> 26:07.856
I'll take a couple of the
chocolate mint kind.

26:11.143 --> 26:12.078
So...

26:12.102 --> 26:13.611
this is where you live?

26:14.604 --> 26:15.790
On a boat?

26:15.814 --> 26:17.240
Neat.

26:17.816 --> 26:19.284
The only way to live.

26:19.526 --> 26:20.711
You wake up in the morning

26:20.735 --> 26:22.370
and you decide you
hate the view,

26:22.779 --> 26:25.466
well, all you've got to
do is loosen the mooring,

26:25.490 --> 26:27.417
and you sail off to
someplace you like better.

26:27.993 --> 26:30.670
I've never been
on a ship before.

26:31.580 --> 26:33.391
I'd like to learn how to sail.

26:33.415 --> 26:35.175
You never stood behind a wheel?

26:35.500 --> 26:36.926
Never come about?

26:37.043 --> 26:38.271
Never hoisted a mizzen?

26:38.295 --> 26:40.221
I'm only 11.

26:41.631 --> 26:43.057
Fair enough.

26:43.967 --> 26:47.145
I mean, did your daughter
sail before she was 11?

26:51.224 --> 26:53.109
That's six bucks, right?

26:57.105 --> 26:58.948
You see something
that interests you?

27:00.025 --> 27:01.993
You like violin music.

27:02.777 --> 27:04.547
Hey, I'm missing the latest
issue of Rolling Stone.

27:04.571 --> 27:06.498
Check to see if it's in
there, would you, Bay?

27:07.032 --> 27:08.249
Check for yourself.

27:09.701 --> 27:11.044
What the hell?

27:13.622 --> 27:15.131
What is going on with you?

27:15.207 --> 27:16.267
All of a sudden
you're interested

27:16.291 --> 27:18.218
in Gregarian chants, huh?

27:19.169 --> 27:21.355
It's Gregorian chants, I think,

27:21.379 --> 27:22.565
and what the hell
is your problem?

27:22.589 --> 27:25.642
My problem is, you don't know how to
stay out of other people's territory.

27:25.675 --> 27:26.893
What?

27:26.968 --> 27:29.113
I'm interested in her, okay?

27:29.137 --> 27:30.323
In... In Kirsten?

27:30.347 --> 27:31.365
You mean she's the older woman?

27:31.389 --> 27:33.284
You said... You said...
You said a senior.

27:33.308 --> 27:35.453
What do you think I made her
that dinner for last night?

27:35.477 --> 27:37.111
I have no idea.

27:37.604 --> 27:40.374
Honestly, I have no idea
what you're thinking, Bay.

27:40.398 --> 27:42.867
You're 16 years old.
You're in high school.

27:42.901 --> 27:44.629
She's in grad school.
She's a professional.

27:44.653 --> 27:46.829
You actually think she's going
to be interested in you?

27:46.988 --> 27:48.373
I could ask you the same thing.

27:51.284 --> 27:53.002
For your information,
she asked <i>me</i> out,

27:53.620 --> 27:56.798
so I guess she's not waiting
around for you to make your move.

27:57.916 --> 28:00.144
You can have any girl you want.

28:00.168 --> 28:01.229
You just walk into a room,

28:01.253 --> 28:02.647
and every girl in there
wants to be with you.

28:02.671 --> 28:03.814
You always get
whatever you want.

28:03.838 --> 28:05.858
- That's bull, man.
- And this is important to me.

28:05.882 --> 28:06.984
It's a fantasy, Bay.

28:07.008 --> 28:08.194
So what?

28:08.218 --> 28:10.478
So it's my fantasy. What
is wrong with that?

28:10.887 --> 28:13.324
I spend my whole life
worrying about everyone

28:13.348 --> 28:14.575
and taking care of everything,

28:14.599 --> 28:16.109
but this is mine,

28:16.643 --> 28:19.362
and maybe it won't work
out, but maybe it will.

28:19.771 --> 28:21.823
Maybe one-in-a-million, it will.

28:23.608 --> 28:25.201
And you know what else, Charlie?

28:25.694 --> 28:28.506
You'll walk down the street
tomorrow, and you'll see someone,

28:28.530 --> 28:30.675
or some woman will pay you to
do a job for her on her place,

28:30.699 --> 28:32.093
and you'll hop
into bed with her,

28:32.117 --> 28:34.210
and you'll forget
all about Kirsten.

28:34.911 --> 28:36.462
I know you.

28:37.789 --> 28:39.215
Screw you, Bailey.

28:43.795 --> 28:46.014
So what do you say?
Your house or mine?

28:46.172 --> 28:48.192
I want to go to
this party tonight.

28:48.216 --> 28:50.444
Uh-huh. No, we can't.
We've got a paper due.

28:50.468 --> 28:51.946
So what'll it be?

28:51.970 --> 28:54.323
So we'll blow it off. Come on, Libby.
It'll be so much fun.

28:54.347 --> 28:56.826
Julia, we've got like 12 hours

28:56.850 --> 28:58.327
to get this F off our record.

28:58.351 --> 28:59.620
So what? So we get an F.

28:59.644 --> 29:00.945
It's not gonna kill us.

29:01.104 --> 29:03.489
Something has definitely
gone wrong with you.

29:03.857 --> 29:05.700
Did you have, like,
a little stroke?

29:06.192 --> 29:07.753
No, I just don't want
to spend the night

29:07.777 --> 29:09.245
writing a stupid paper.

29:11.448 --> 29:12.341
Please, Lib?

29:12.365 --> 29:13.625
No.

29:15.577 --> 29:16.961
Why not?

29:17.120 --> 29:19.765
Is this party really
so important to you?

29:19.789 --> 29:21.100
I mean, you really
care that much

29:21.124 --> 29:23.894
about Nina DiMayo and
her stupid friends?

29:23.918 --> 29:25.929
You know, they don't
even know your name.

29:26.504 --> 29:29.098
And you care that much
about getting another A.

29:29.299 --> 29:30.975
I'm not gonna explain
this to you.

29:31.259 --> 29:32.695
I'm not gonna explain
why it's better

29:32.719 --> 29:34.322
to work hard and get good grades

29:34.346 --> 29:35.489
and, like, go to college

29:35.513 --> 29:37.440
than hang out with
people who talk about,

29:37.474 --> 29:39.233
I don't know, getting drunk.

29:40.018 --> 29:41.162
At least they don't
spend their time

29:41.186 --> 29:42.663
comparing perfect
attendance records

29:42.687 --> 29:44.906
and swapping answers
to trig questions.

29:45.231 --> 29:47.585
If you're bored with my
company, don't let me keep you.

29:47.609 --> 29:49.285
That's not what I'm saying.

29:49.402 --> 29:50.796
You know, you're one to talk.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.882
You've got more As than anyone,

29:52.906 --> 29:54.175
and if it's all so moronic,

29:54.199 --> 29:55.968
then what the hell
have you been doing?

29:55.992 --> 29:57.794
- I don't know!
- Shh.

29:58.662 --> 30:00.380
I don't know.

30:01.956 --> 30:03.257
It's stupid, Lib.

30:04.459 --> 30:06.469
It's all just a
stupid waste of time,

30:07.295 --> 30:09.806
because tomorrow it could all
be over, just like that.

30:11.174 --> 30:13.351
It could all be over before
I've had any fun at all.

30:17.389 --> 30:19.700
Listen, I didn't
want to say anything

30:19.724 --> 30:20.701
until I was sure...

30:20.725 --> 30:21.952
Oh, Ross called.
He wants to know

30:21.976 --> 30:23.371
if he can switch your
lesson to Friday.

30:23.395 --> 30:24.696
But now I am.

30:25.021 --> 30:26.781
Well, sure, that is.

30:27.399 --> 30:28.783
I found him.

30:29.859 --> 30:31.160
I found him.

30:31.569 --> 30:32.954
Our grandfather.

30:33.279 --> 30:34.622
Grandpa Jack.

30:34.656 --> 30:36.040
I found him.

30:36.491 --> 30:39.002
He's been living in the
marina on a sailboat.

30:39.703 --> 30:41.097
All this time.

30:41.121 --> 30:42.505
Isn't that funny?

30:44.582 --> 30:47.385
How do you know it's him, Claud?
Did you talk to him?

30:47.669 --> 30:48.562
Duh.

30:48.586 --> 30:50.346
And he said he was
our grandfather?

30:50.380 --> 30:52.807
Well, no, but he is.

30:53.925 --> 30:56.394
Okay, number one, his
name is Jack Gordon.

30:56.428 --> 30:58.104
That's a pretty common name.

30:58.138 --> 30:59.657
Number two, he was in the Navy.

30:59.681 --> 31:01.524
So are hundreds of guys, Claud.

31:01.558 --> 31:04.819
Number three, he listens to
violin music all the time.

31:04.978 --> 31:06.288
- Number four...
- Claudia...

31:06.312 --> 31:07.373
Number 4 is,

31:07.397 --> 31:09.083
he's been married two times,

31:09.107 --> 31:11.743
except he doesn't ever like to
talk about his first marriage,

31:12.569 --> 31:13.995
you know,

31:14.070 --> 31:16.039
probably because he feels
so bad about leaving Mom.

31:19.868 --> 31:22.336
But you never asked
him, Claud, did you?

31:22.662 --> 31:24.881
You never said, "I think
you're my grandfather."

31:24.998 --> 31:26.257
Of course not.

31:26.458 --> 31:29.427
I mean, he left a
family once before.

31:29.753 --> 31:31.188
If I told him there
were five of us,

31:31.212 --> 31:32.847
he'd probably have
a heart attack

31:32.964 --> 31:34.599
or disappear.

31:35.925 --> 31:37.643
He's got to get
to know us first,

31:38.511 --> 31:40.646
before he finds out, well,

31:41.723 --> 31:43.149
we belong to him.

31:51.065 --> 31:52.366
You don't believe me.

31:53.610 --> 31:54.952
Claud, it's...

31:55.487 --> 31:56.829
It's not that we don't want to.

31:56.863 --> 31:58.831
It just sounds so...

32:00.325 --> 32:01.834
Unlikely.

32:03.703 --> 32:05.922
None of you did
anything to find him.

32:06.706 --> 32:08.674
You never even tried,

32:09.125 --> 32:10.436
but I did.

32:10.460 --> 32:12.053
I found him,

32:12.378 --> 32:14.013
so I don't care what you think.

32:14.380 --> 32:16.099
I know he's our grandfather.

32:29.103 --> 32:30.321
The thing is,

32:30.480 --> 32:33.324
it'd be really good to
have someone else around.

32:33.858 --> 32:35.451
Just in case.

32:36.653 --> 32:39.247
Just in case something happens,

32:39.405 --> 32:42.250
or Bailey and Julia
go away to college,

32:42.534 --> 32:45.044
or Charlie gets tired
of taking care of us,

32:45.912 --> 32:47.880
which I could understand.

32:49.707 --> 32:51.092
Just in case.

33:01.427 --> 33:02.770
You check on Claud?

33:03.263 --> 33:05.022
Only one she'll talk to is Owen.

33:05.557 --> 33:06.899
How's this going?

33:07.475 --> 33:09.694
Essentially, I'm screwed.

33:10.270 --> 33:11.539
I can't concentrate.

33:11.563 --> 33:13.156
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

33:13.690 --> 33:15.074
It's just...

33:15.483 --> 33:18.161
Things are just not going
real well right now.

33:18.862 --> 33:20.422
Does this have anything to
do with you and Charlie?

33:20.446 --> 33:22.091
'Cause I'm getting some vibes.

33:22.115 --> 33:23.384
Don't get me started, okay?

33:23.408 --> 33:25.251
It can't be that bad.

33:26.578 --> 33:27.962
On second thought...

33:28.705 --> 33:29.964
I'm looking at an F.

33:30.206 --> 33:31.591
Maybe a G-minus.

33:32.125 --> 33:33.718
Not that you would
know what that's like.

33:34.168 --> 33:35.845
So, have fun at your party.

33:36.588 --> 33:38.931
I'm sure you'll come up
with something by tomorrow.

33:40.341 --> 33:41.934
Do you have a thesis sentence?

33:43.928 --> 33:46.272
A thesis sentence. A summary
of what you want to say.

33:47.056 --> 33:48.316
Yeah.

33:48.391 --> 33:50.526
"This poem doesn't
make any sense."

33:56.065 --> 33:57.617
Okay. How about this?

33:58.026 --> 33:59.169
"To His Coy Mistress"

33:59.193 --> 34:02.006
is Andrew Marvell's lament
to the timelessness of love

34:02.030 --> 34:03.873
and the mortality
of human flesh.

34:05.241 --> 34:06.709
Do I know you?

34:06.784 --> 34:09.587
Type it in. Timelessness of
love, mortality of human flesh.

34:12.290 --> 34:13.549
This is great.

34:17.503 --> 34:19.013
This is fantastic.

34:22.675 --> 34:23.809
Now what?

34:24.802 --> 34:26.237
In so doing,

34:26.262 --> 34:27.980
the poet and his mistress,

34:28.014 --> 34:30.524
instead of being at
the mercy of time,

34:32.268 --> 34:33.860
become its master.

34:34.353 --> 34:36.364
This is where I want
to put in the quote.

34:36.731 --> 34:37.875
Uh,

34:37.899 --> 34:40.368
"like amorous birds of prey

34:40.610 --> 34:42.745
our time devour."

34:44.447 --> 34:45.915
Whoa. I am good.

34:47.909 --> 34:49.918
We're good. We're good.

34:51.161 --> 34:52.588
You're good.

34:53.414 --> 34:55.049
Devour time...

34:56.083 --> 34:57.969
like amorous birds of prey.

35:00.254 --> 35:01.597
Time check.

35:01.923 --> 35:03.349
Uh...

35:04.092 --> 35:05.611
2:15.

35:05.635 --> 35:06.894
You're kidding.

35:07.345 --> 35:08.896
Damn! I can't...

35:09.514 --> 35:11.659
Look, just do a couple of
paragraphs on the imagery

35:11.683 --> 35:12.826
and come up with a conclusion

35:12.850 --> 35:14.235
I'm going to bed.

35:16.562 --> 35:17.780
Hey.

35:19.607 --> 35:20.992
You saved my life.

35:22.652 --> 35:24.078
I know.

35:28.116 --> 35:29.500
So?

35:31.244 --> 35:32.670
So?

35:32.787 --> 35:34.130
So was it fun?

35:34.247 --> 35:35.589
The party?

35:35.748 --> 35:36.924
I didn't go.

35:37.583 --> 35:38.519
Really?

35:38.543 --> 35:41.512
Yeah, I got stuck at
home dealing with stuff.

35:41.587 --> 35:43.180
So did you write it?

35:44.632 --> 35:45.609
You?

35:45.633 --> 35:47.018
Yeah, I kind of did.

35:53.307 --> 35:56.286
Look, why don't you read
it over really fast?

35:56.310 --> 35:58.821
Maybe you could say some of
the same stuff differently.

35:59.022 --> 36:01.532
Even if it's not five pages, you
could still turn something in.

36:02.692 --> 36:03.868
That's okay,

36:04.068 --> 36:05.494
but thanks.

36:06.779 --> 36:08.674
Okay, gang, let's get started.

36:08.698 --> 36:10.300
Why don't we talk
about the last scene

36:10.324 --> 36:11.917
between Lear and his daughters?

36:12.326 --> 36:14.587
Goneril, Regan, Cordelia,

36:15.079 --> 36:16.422
they all...

36:17.540 --> 36:20.051
Miss Behrens. Miss Salinger.

36:20.168 --> 36:21.469
Do you have something for me?

36:27.216 --> 36:28.351
Julia?

36:29.343 --> 36:30.478
I'm sorry.

36:34.599 --> 36:35.900
Mr. Gordon?

36:39.937 --> 36:41.280
I'm Bailey Salinger.

36:42.065 --> 36:43.199
Yes?

36:43.274 --> 36:45.326
I think you met my
kid sister, Claudia.

36:45.651 --> 36:47.912
Oh. Sure did. The Girl Scout.

36:48.154 --> 36:49.288
The what?

36:49.530 --> 36:50.915
She's a pistol, that one.

36:51.574 --> 36:53.042
Yeah, she is.

36:53.951 --> 36:55.095
The thing is, Mr. Gordon,

36:55.119 --> 36:57.463
I don't think she's been
completely up front with you.

36:58.372 --> 37:00.466
I'm not sure what she told
you about our situation.

37:01.501 --> 37:02.802
I'm not following you.

37:03.252 --> 37:05.846
Our parents were killed in
a car accident last March.

37:06.130 --> 37:07.473
It was a drunk driver.

37:07.548 --> 37:08.650
Oh.

37:08.674 --> 37:09.850
I'm sorry.

37:10.885 --> 37:12.186
And we're kind of on our own.

37:13.054 --> 37:13.989
There's not much family.

37:14.013 --> 37:16.774
Just an uncle in Europe, but
he couldn't really deal.

37:17.016 --> 37:18.651
All our grandparents are gone...

37:19.018 --> 37:20.319
except for one.

37:20.394 --> 37:21.695
Our mother's father.

37:22.146 --> 37:24.407
He's been out of the
picture for like 30 years.

37:24.732 --> 37:26.325
You and he have the same name.

37:28.069 --> 37:29.203
Do we, now?

37:30.655 --> 37:33.457
See, my sister's gotten
it into her head that...

37:35.118 --> 37:37.044
Claud's got this
crazy idea that...

37:37.870 --> 37:39.171
well, that you're him,

37:39.205 --> 37:40.349
and of course, you're not.

37:40.373 --> 37:41.799
I mean, that's what
we've told her.

37:42.333 --> 37:44.510
I mean, there's no way you
could be our grandfather.

37:47.046 --> 37:48.431
Right?

37:55.680 --> 37:57.440
My mother's name was Diana.

38:04.021 --> 38:05.823
Want a lift?

38:09.944 --> 38:11.287
You know what I did today?

38:11.320 --> 38:12.455
Seatbelt.

38:12.530 --> 38:13.956
Seatbelt. Right.

38:15.158 --> 38:16.959
I went to see a friend of yours.

38:18.161 --> 38:19.680
We sat on the deck of his boat

38:19.704 --> 38:21.172
and talked for a long time.

38:21.497 --> 38:22.766
He's a really nice guy...

38:22.790 --> 38:24.133
I told you.

38:24.333 --> 38:25.759
But you know what, Claud?

38:26.711 --> 38:28.137
He's not our grandfather.

38:29.255 --> 38:31.182
You told him about
us, didn't you?

38:32.008 --> 38:33.819
See, that's why he
doesn't want to admit...

38:33.843 --> 38:36.812
There weren't any kids
from his first marriage,

38:37.555 --> 38:39.908
he never lived in Seattle,
just passed through,

38:39.932 --> 38:41.358
and he's got grandkids.

38:41.893 --> 38:43.777
Six of them. He
showed me pictures.

38:47.231 --> 38:49.825
I think you knew he wasn't
all along, didn't you?

38:56.199 --> 38:57.416
Claudia,

38:57.909 --> 39:00.419
whatever you thought
he could do for you,

39:01.370 --> 39:03.255
however you thought
he could help

39:03.789 --> 39:04.683
or make things easier,

39:04.707 --> 39:06.143
whatever you needed him to be,

39:06.167 --> 39:07.676
we've got to be that for you.

39:09.378 --> 39:10.888
'Cause it's just us.

39:12.340 --> 39:14.767
That's all we've got.
It's just us.

39:19.430 --> 39:21.273
We're not doing so bad, are we?

39:22.850 --> 39:24.119
I mean, I know
sometimes it's hard,

39:24.143 --> 39:26.320
but on the whole, I'd say
we're doing pretty okay.

39:26.979 --> 39:28.197
Wouldn't you?

39:31.359 --> 39:32.743
Claudia?

39:35.613 --> 39:37.540
Are we just going to
sit here or what?

39:54.757 --> 39:55.891
Excuse me.

39:56.759 --> 39:57.935
Nina?

39:58.386 --> 40:00.020
Do you have change for a dollar?

40:01.264 --> 40:02.282
Change. Do you have change?

40:02.306 --> 40:04.066
Um, I don't know.

40:07.395 --> 40:08.737
Yeah.

40:09.188 --> 40:10.322
Great.

40:12.566 --> 40:13.794
Miss Minor?

40:13.818 --> 40:14.994
Yeah.

40:15.152 --> 40:16.954
She almost failed me last year.

40:17.571 --> 40:19.841
Like Shakespeare's ever going
to be relevant in my life.

40:19.865 --> 40:21.333
Really.

40:30.459 --> 40:32.469
Bummer taking the bus, huh?

40:32.795 --> 40:34.513
Oh, you have no idea.

40:35.214 --> 40:36.817
My boyfriend usually
gives me a lift home,

40:36.841 --> 40:39.393
but he has detention today.

40:40.011 --> 40:41.822
He mooned Mrs. Vidora.

40:41.846 --> 40:43.573
- You're kidding. That was him?
- Yeah.

40:43.597 --> 40:44.616
Bio class, right?

40:44.640 --> 40:45.826
- Chem.
- Uh.

40:45.850 --> 40:48.745
But his big mistake was telling
her to consider herself lucky,

40:48.769 --> 40:51.864
since that was probably the only
male butt she'd see all decade.

40:52.398 --> 40:54.199
I think the lab
fumes got to him.

40:55.276 --> 40:57.494
Rumor has it she
used to be a he.

40:58.195 --> 40:59.872
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:59.989 --> 41:01.258
Mrs. Vidora?

41:01.282 --> 41:02.708
Mm-hmm.

41:02.783 --> 41:04.303
You ever looked at her wrists?

41:04.327 --> 41:05.628
Tree trunks.

41:05.870 --> 41:08.557
Who taught her to put on
makeup anyway, you know?

41:08.581 --> 41:10.976
I mean, cosmetics
should not look

41:11.000 --> 41:12.644
like they've been
applied with a spatula.

41:12.668 --> 41:13.770
Words to live by.

41:13.794 --> 41:15.220
Yeah.

41:15.713 --> 41:17.274
Hey, you know Lani
Sutter, right?

41:17.298 --> 41:18.525
Oh, my God.

41:18.549 --> 41:20.225
Now, this is a story.

41:20.384 --> 41:21.644
Listen to this.

41:29.143 --> 41:30.819
When's Charlie getting off?

41:30.936 --> 41:32.571
Beats me.

41:33.481 --> 41:34.833
Might as well go
ahead and order.

41:34.857 --> 41:36.700
It's just the four
of us for dinner.

41:38.778 --> 41:40.204
Charlie's got a date.

41:45.326 --> 41:47.002
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

41:47.328 --> 41:48.671
You look nice.

41:51.749 --> 41:53.300
It should be a great concert.

41:53.334 --> 41:55.052
I'm really looking
forward to it.

41:55.753 --> 41:57.189
Sorry you had to cancel.

41:57.213 --> 41:59.390
Sort of last minute,
huh, Charlie?

41:59.965 --> 42:01.266
I'm sorry.

42:01.425 --> 42:02.601
Work.

42:03.219 --> 42:04.363
Listen, um...

42:04.387 --> 42:05.530
let me pay for the ticket.

42:05.554 --> 42:07.815
No, no. No, it's okay.

42:08.182 --> 42:09.858
I'm going with this guy George.

42:10.184 --> 42:11.953
He's been after me to
go out for a while.

42:11.977 --> 42:13.987
Turns out he loves
Gregorian chants.

42:15.314 --> 42:16.740
Yeah, who doesn't?

42:19.276 --> 42:20.337
George, huh?

42:20.361 --> 42:21.995
I'm meeting him right outside.

42:25.116 --> 42:26.667
I've got to go.

42:29.578 --> 42:31.004
See you.

42:33.374 --> 42:35.259
So can you give me
a lift, Bailey?

42:36.085 --> 42:37.302
Bailey?

42:37.920 --> 42:39.346
What is so fascinating?

42:39.839 --> 42:41.682
Ordering here or what?

42:42.216 --> 42:43.809
I thought you were, uh...

42:45.052 --> 42:46.488
What do you need? An
explanation in writing?

42:46.512 --> 42:47.938
We're not going out, okay?

42:50.099 --> 42:51.358
Thanks.

42:51.851 --> 42:52.744
Pass the bread, will you?

42:52.768 --> 42:53.995
What's going on here?

42:54.019 --> 42:55.487
You and Kirsten?

42:55.688 --> 42:57.698
Wait, you were going
out with Kirsten?

42:57.815 --> 42:59.450
- Claud, have a roll.
- With Kirsten?

42:59.733 --> 43:01.160
Can we order?

43:01.277 --> 43:02.379
Sure, Charlie.

43:02.403 --> 43:03.296
What are you having?

43:03.320 --> 43:04.297
Steak.

43:04.321 --> 43:05.539
You always have steak.

43:05.781 --> 43:07.426
- So? -You got to watch
your cholesterol.

43:07.450 --> 43:09.042
Yeah. I'll get tested.

43:10.369 --> 43:12.129
She eats like a truck driver.

43:12.538 --> 43:15.132
Listen, I got this idea,

43:15.291 --> 43:16.768
and I don't want you to say no,

43:16.792 --> 43:18.302
'cause it will be really cool.

43:19.044 --> 43:21.148
Did you know you can rent
sailboats at the marina?

43:21.172 --> 43:22.556
Sounds logical.

43:23.215 --> 43:25.392
They let you take them
out all day if you want,

43:26.051 --> 43:28.270
but you have to have a grownup.

43:29.472 --> 43:30.449
Charlie?

43:30.473 --> 43:31.658
I'm in.

43:31.682 --> 43:32.701
Great.

43:32.725 --> 43:34.276
Have you guys ever been sailing?

43:34.393 --> 43:35.620
- No.
- I don't think so.

43:35.644 --> 43:36.904
Uh-uh.

43:36.979 --> 43:40.365
See, the thing about sailing is,

43:40.608 --> 43:43.577
you can just loosen the moorings
and go wherever you want.

43:44.778 --> 43:46.173
You do have to know some things,

43:46.197 --> 43:49.750
like swabbing the deck and
coming about and mizzens.

43:49.909 --> 43:51.335
Well, that's a sail,

43:52.119 --> 43:53.545
but I can show you.

43:54.288 --> 43:55.422
See?

43:56.665 --> 43:58.258
It's fun for the whole family.
