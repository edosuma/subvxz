WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:06.132
Crockett, it's okay.

00:06.215 --> 00:07.800
What happened is in the past.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.552
Can't remember what it was.

00:09.635 --> 00:13.139
Now we just have to set up the nursery,
but in the meantime,

00:13.389 --> 00:14.682
how about that date?

00:16.642 --> 00:19.645
You won't turn yourself in.
I can't let this go on.

00:19.729 --> 00:21.063
I thought we had an understanding.

00:21.313 --> 00:23.524
You can't possibly know what it's like.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.443
Every day I say I'm gonna quit.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.820
-I will turn myself in.
-I can go with you.

00:28.404 --> 00:29.655
Yeah, I'd like that.

00:29.739 --> 00:31.532
Come to my place?

00:40.750 --> 00:41.751
Hey.

00:42.501 --> 00:43.544
Hey.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.092
HANNAH: Mmm, breakfast?

00:50.176 --> 00:53.095
There's a spot on the corner
with excellent French press.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.682
Um, what time is it?

01:01.854 --> 01:03.522
No, sorry.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.859
I gotta get to work.
My shift starts soon.

01:07.443 --> 01:08.652
Mmm...

01:17.244 --> 01:18.829
Listen,

01:18.913 --> 01:20.498
what we talked about last night,

01:21.248 --> 01:23.417
this doesn't change anything, does it?

01:23.501 --> 01:25.920
You mean my reporting myself?

01:27.171 --> 01:29.673
Do you think I slept with you
just to get out of it?

01:29.757 --> 01:30.841
No.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.970
I just wanna make sure
that's still the plan.

01:35.054 --> 01:36.138
It is.

01:37.056 --> 01:40.476
I just need to round on a few patients
so I can hand them off,

01:42.019 --> 01:44.396
then I talk to Ms. Goodwin.

01:44.480 --> 01:45.648
I'll come with you.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.483
Yeah, I want you to.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.821
Hannah, you're so smart.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.240
And tough.

01:55.074 --> 01:56.826
You're so much more than this addiction.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.079
I know you're gonna beat it.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.677
-Hi, Mr. Sher.
-Oh, please, call me Lewis.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.637
This is my ex-wife, Elaine.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.264
Hi.

02:18.347 --> 02:20.224
-And my daughter Harper.
-Hi.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.642
I'm Dr. Manning.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.520
So, I see you're experiencing
some abdominal pain.

02:24.603 --> 02:27.648
His tummy started hurting
as soon as he got off the airplane today.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.276
Oh, really?
And where did he fly in from?

02:31.026 --> 02:32.361
Daddy lives in Geneva.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.990
It's 2:20 in the afternoon
there right now.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.700
-Oh.
-ELAINE: Harper, sweetie,

02:37.783 --> 02:40.578
just let the doctor do her work, okay?
It's okay.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.663
I'm just impressed
you know so much about Geneva.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.291
My daddy works in a laboratory there.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.085
He's a chemical scientist.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.296
-Wow.
-A polymer engineer.

02:50.379 --> 02:53.632
-You mind?
-ELAINE: Harper, honey, come here.

02:59.430 --> 03:02.182
Does your job require you to handle
any toxic materials?

03:02.266 --> 03:06.103
I work with a lot of heavy metals,
but I always take proper precautions. Why?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.939
I am hearing some congestion
in your chest.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.984
As well as a slight discoloration
in your eyes.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.987
It could be due to some kind
of toxic exposure.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.907
Let's get a tox screen,
and a CBC, BMP and a UA.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.617
-Okay.
-Is my daddy gonna be okay?

03:20.200 --> 03:23.037
I promise, I am gonna take very good
care of your dad.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.496
Okay?

03:24.580 --> 03:26.373
I'll be back to check on you soon.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.043
Give me one sec.

03:32.755 --> 03:34.256
-Dr. Manning?
-Yeah?

03:34.340 --> 03:37.718
There's something he's not telling you,
and I'm worried if you don't know it,

03:37.801 --> 03:39.345
it will be a problem in treating him.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.138
Absolutely. What is it?

03:41.722 --> 03:45.684
Well, everything he just said in there,
it's not true.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.561
I'm sorry?

03:47.645 --> 03:51.315
Lewis is not a polymer engineer
in Geneva.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.778
His real name is Derek Jordan,
and he's an actor from New York.

03:56.946 --> 03:58.822
-An actor?
-Yes.

03:58.906 --> 04:03.744
It's a long story,
but I hired him to play this role.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.164
I don't understand. What role?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.500
The role of my daughter's father.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.726
One, two.

04:29.144 --> 04:32.773
Harper, sweetie, let's go get a snack
so the doctor can talk to your father.

04:33.732 --> 04:34.942
Be right back, Daddy.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.151
Okay, sweetie.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.327
Elaine filled me in on your arrangement.

04:46.495 --> 04:49.540
I understand you want to keep pretending
for Harper's sake,

04:49.623 --> 04:50.874
but since we're alone,

04:50.958 --> 04:53.752
I do need to gather some
real information from you.

04:55.129 --> 04:58.382
So, your initial tox screen was negative,

04:58.465 --> 05:00.801
and your hemoglobin is low.

05:00.884 --> 05:05.139
Have you ever had any blood disorders
or iron deficiencies in your past?

05:05.222 --> 05:06.765
I don't think so.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.892
Okay, why don't you give me your
doctor's information,

05:08.976 --> 05:11.270
and I'll have your medical records sent
over from New York.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.939
As my daughter told you, I live in Geneva.

05:16.150 --> 05:20.446
Mr. Jordan, if I'm gonna
treat you properly,

05:20.529 --> 05:24.783
I'm gonna need your medical history,
not your character's.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.911
My name is Lewis Sher,

05:27.995 --> 05:30.205
and I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:39.256 --> 05:42.468
Hey, Doris, will you add
a liver panel to my patient in Three?

05:42.551 --> 05:44.094
And also page Dr. Charles.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.971
This guy is nuts.

05:51.435 --> 05:52.436
Thanks.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.980
Hey, how's your hormone therapy going?

05:55.564 --> 05:57.983
(SIGHS) It feels like my skin is
crawling with ants.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.944
But other than that, I'm holding up.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.029
Hang in there.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.739
Hopefully your numbers
will level out soon.

06:03.822 --> 06:04.907
Yeah.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.617
-(WOMAN 1 SHUDDERS)
-WOMAN 2: Need some help over here.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.410
MAGGIE: Okay. Hold this.

06:08.494 --> 06:11.413
Siana Fredericks, seven months pregnant.
I just paged her OB.

06:11.497 --> 06:12.998
Okay, let's take her to Treatment Four.

06:13.082 --> 06:15.334
I'm Dr. Halstead.
This is Nurse Lockwood.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.127
You having contractions?

06:17.211 --> 06:19.254
I'm not in labor.
I'm having a pain crisis.

06:19.338 --> 06:20.964
Are you talking about
a sickle cell crisis?

06:21.048 --> 06:23.050
-Yes.
-Have you had any flare-ups recently?

06:23.133 --> 06:24.468
Not since I've been pregnant.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.137
My OB has me on a special diet
that's been helping.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.723
Is there anyone we can call?

06:29.807 --> 06:31.683
I already spoke to my husband.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.811
He's stuck in Minneapolis.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.438
-When did the pain start?
-Yesterday morning.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.649
Let's get her on oxygen,
hang a liter of saline,

06:38.732 --> 06:40.109
and push two milligrams of morphine.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.027
No! No morphine.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.531
Siana, 24 hours is a long time.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.449
We have to get your crisis under control.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.076
You don't understand.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.120
I've been through three rounds of IVF.

06:51.203 --> 06:54.581
I'm finally carrying an embryo
that doesn't have this awful disease.

06:54.665 --> 06:57.709
I'm gonna make sure everything is perfect
for this baby.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.795
Please call my OB, Dr. Asher.

07:01.130 --> 07:03.132
-Hannah Asher?
-Yes.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.801
She's been helping with my birth plan.
She'll know what to do.

07:05.884 --> 07:09.221
Okay. Yeah, we'll contact
Dr. Asher, order some labs.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.014
I'll be back to check on you soon.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.850
Okay.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.185
You're calling OB?

07:15.269 --> 07:16.728
I'll try Asher's cell.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.440
We're friends.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.695
Going straight to voicemail.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.572
OB must be backed up this morning.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.868
-I'll run up and find her.
-All right.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.081
How'd it go?

07:36.165 --> 07:38.834
He wouldn't break character for me either.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.170
Break character?
This isn't a play.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.339
Yeah, I mean,
I've been doing this for 30 years.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.424
This is a new one.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.344
And this poor little girl
growing up with this lie?

07:49.428 --> 07:51.388
Okay, but she's not sick.
He is.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.472
So what do we do?

07:56.518 --> 07:58.103
-I had fun last night.
-(GIGGLES)

07:58.187 --> 07:59.897
Me, too.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.857
How about we do it again tonight?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.317
Wow.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.195
Absolutely.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.990
April. With me.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.658
Noah.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.579
Paramedics just called.

08:15.662 --> 08:19.625
I got a guy over on Chicago Avenue
with some sort of cardiac event.

08:19.708 --> 08:20.959
All my attendings are tied up.

08:21.043 --> 08:24.171
-Was hoping that you two could handle it.
-How long until they land?

08:24.254 --> 08:26.089
They're not.
I need you two to get over there.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.467
Guy's refusing to get in the ambo.

08:31.053 --> 08:32.888
So, you think that he's really sick?

08:32.971 --> 08:34.932
Yes, his symptoms are all over the place.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.725
But he refuses to cooperate.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.060
God.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.979
We can't make a diagnosis
without an accurate history.

08:41.063 --> 08:44.566
Do you think that you could talk to him?
Get him to drop the performance?

08:44.650 --> 08:48.695
I wish that I could,
but that is how he is.

08:48.779 --> 08:52.407
When I first met Derek,
he was playing a paraplegic on Broadway.

08:52.491 --> 08:54.993
He would go home every night
in his wheelchair.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.996
Okay, I think
this is getting out of hand.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.082
I'm sorry, but we might have
to call Child Services.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.250
-No.
-I'm sorry,

09:01.333 --> 09:03.669
but we are very concerned
about Harper.

09:03.752 --> 09:04.962
No, no, no. Don't do that.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.715
This is all about Harper.
That is why I did this.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.717
I grew up without a father.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.928
I couldn't stand the thought of that
happening to her.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.013
But, I mean, hiring an actor?

09:15.097 --> 09:17.557
I mean, you didn't have any male friends

09:17.641 --> 09:19.393
or relatives who could serve
as role models?

09:19.476 --> 09:21.103
No.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.815
When Harper's real father abandoned us,

09:25.482 --> 09:26.608
there was nobody.

09:27.276 --> 09:29.027
And when I hired Lewis,

09:29.111 --> 09:32.030
it was just supposed to be one time, okay?

09:32.114 --> 09:34.741
It was father-daughter
day at her preschool,

09:34.825 --> 09:37.077
and the thing is, she just fell
in love with him.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.329
And it made her so happy.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.707
-So you did it again.
-ELAINE: And again.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.375
And again.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.794
Look, I know what I did was wrong,

09:45.877 --> 09:47.713
but I am putting an end to it.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.340
I told Derek this is the last time.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.343
Lewis is gonna go back to Europe.

09:53.427 --> 09:54.803
He's going to get busy with work.

09:55.387 --> 09:58.223
He'll lose touch with Harper,
and after a few months,

09:58.307 --> 10:00.559
I'm gonna tell her that he died
in a work accident.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.185
And that will be the end of it.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.646
But Harper's eight years old.

10:04.730 --> 10:08.191
I mean, don't you think
that killing off her father

10:08.275 --> 10:09.943
would be pretty traumatic for her?

10:10.027 --> 10:11.528
ELAINE: Not as traumatic as the truth.

10:11.611 --> 10:15.657
Harper's real father has zero interest
in being a part of her life.

10:16.992 --> 10:20.704
Please, just try to figure out
what's going on with Derek, okay?

10:24.583 --> 10:25.834
(SIGHS)

10:25.917 --> 10:27.544
So, we're right back where we started?

10:27.627 --> 10:28.712
Well, maybe not.

10:29.796 --> 10:34.634
I mean, if Derek knows
that his character is gonna die,

10:34.718 --> 10:38.263
is it really just a coincidence
that he's ended up in a hospital?

10:52.652 --> 10:53.820
Hannah?

11:06.208 --> 11:08.502
-NURSE: Can I help you?
-Yeah.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.463
I'm looking for Dr. Asher.
She hasn't come in yet.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.298
We had to cancel her first appointment.

11:13.382 --> 11:14.591
Okay. Thanks.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.512
(SIREN BLARES)

11:18.595 --> 11:20.222
APRIL: Hey, Courtney.
What's going on?

11:20.305 --> 11:22.599
Hey. Got here about a half-hour ago.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.059
He refused to get in the ambo.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.896
His name's Larry Simpson.
Cardiologist put him on digoxin.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.941
He mixed up his meds this morning.
Took a triple dose.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.235
All right, we'll take it from here.
Stand by.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.071
Hey, Larry. I'm April.
This is Dr. Sexton.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.156
Thank God. Please help me.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.741
NOAH: Tell us what happened.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.619
I started feeling faint
on my way into work.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.162
I called my cardiologist.

11:44.246 --> 11:47.874
He said to find a way to keep
my heart rate up and call 911.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.584
Okay.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.253
Hey, you thinking what I'm thinking?

11:51.837 --> 11:52.879
A milligram of epi.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.464
Guys.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.216
All right, Larry,

11:56.299 --> 11:58.760
we're gonna give you some meds
to keep your heart rate up

11:58.844 --> 12:00.512
while we get you to the hospital,
all right?

12:00.595 --> 12:02.639
Do what you have to.
I can't keep this up.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.641
Yeah. All the way up.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.477
All right. You're gonna feel
a little pinch.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.939
-Okay.
-All right.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.858
Now, slow it down.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.192
-Wait.
-Oh, Noah!

12:14.276 --> 12:16.486
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.614
-His heart rate must be dropping.
-Hey, Larry. Larry, Larry.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.241
All right, you have to keep
moving, okay?

12:21.324 --> 12:23.660
-Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
-Keep moving.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.874
It's gonna be eight hours
until his body metabolizes the digoxin.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.710
Till that happens, he has to keep running.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.462
We gotta pace his heart.

12:33.545 --> 12:34.629
While he's running.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.965
Hey, guys, you gotta do something.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.468
I got an idea.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.804
-Here we go.
-(DOOR BEEPS)

12:43.555 --> 12:45.640

-Name's Walter Hobbs.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.434
50-year-old prison transfer from Indiana.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.478
Vitals are stable, but there's something
wrong with his arm.

12:49.561 --> 12:50.979
-What happened?
-MAN: Not sure.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.772
-Okay, hang in there, Walter.
-(SCREAMS)

12:52.856 --> 12:54.274

and get him on the monitors.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.859
Easy, buddy.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.403
We're gonna do a sheet transfer
on my count.

12:58.487 --> 13:00.113
Nice and easy, folks.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.698
Watch the shackles, everybody.

-(GROANS)
-Lungs are clear.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.508

13:19.591 --> 13:20.634

13:24.304 --> 13:26.473
-Arm's hard as a rock.
-(SCREAMS)

13:26.556 --> 13:28.642
Okay, all right. He's got
compartment syndrome.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.352
Needs a fasciotomy
to relieve the pressure.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.103
Let's get the Hybrid OR ready.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.313
Any idea what caused this?

13:36.233 --> 13:39.319
Fellas? Drugs, fight, what are we
working with here?

13:39.402 --> 13:42.447
Hey, Indiana sent him
to the closest level-one trauma center

13:42.531 --> 13:43.782
because his wounds are severe.

13:43.865 --> 13:46.201
We can't treat him if you don't tell us
what happened.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.745
Walter's been on Indiana
death row for 10 years.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.164
The creep killed a family of five
at a home invasion.

13:51.748 --> 13:55.877
He was scheduled to be executed today,
but something went wrong, didn't kill him.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.882
You mean, you gave this man
a lethal injection?

14:01.883 --> 14:03.552
Yeah, except it wasn't lethal.

14:12.185 --> 14:16.106
Well, I was able to
open up his arm and relieve the pressure,

14:16.189 --> 14:17.399
but he's still in bad shape.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.858
And the corrections officers insist

14:18.942 --> 14:20.735
they don't know what was
in the lethal cocktail.

14:20.819 --> 14:21.903
Well, I'm not surprised.

14:21.987 --> 14:24.072
Pharmaceutical companies
are no longer permitting

14:24.155 --> 14:26.533
the use of their drugs for executions.

14:26.616 --> 14:31.162
Odds are these guys used something
without their authorization.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.789
Fools missed his vein completely.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.625
Drugs are trapped in his muscle,
slowly leeching into his bloodstream.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.419
We need to know what they gave him.

14:37.502 --> 14:38.628
Well, I'll call the warden,

14:38.712 --> 14:41.548
and see if I can coax him into telling me
what they used.

14:41.631 --> 14:44.801
Meantime, see what else you can do
to flush his system.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.595
ETHAN: Yes, ma'am.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.056
MARCEL: They really did a number on him.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.393
Let's just treat the guy
and get him out of here.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.312
Amen to that.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.649
Where's Dr. Asher?

14:59.733 --> 15:01.526
I'm afraid she's not available right now.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.695
Good news is I went ahead
and paged Dr. Patchefsky.

15:03.778 --> 15:04.863
I don't want another doctor.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.656
-She's more than qualified.
-SIANA: No way.

15:06.740 --> 15:10.910
I've had too many doctors accuse me
of using my pain as an excuse to get high.

15:11.494 --> 15:14.748
Dr. Asher's the only one
who understands my situation.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.666
Siana, your labs show that you're anemic.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.252
If you won't see another OB,
at least let me give you some blood.

15:19.336 --> 15:20.795
-A transfusion?
-Yes.

-(GRUNTS) I don't know.
-MAGGIE: Siana,

15:23.089 --> 15:24.424
the last thing Dr. Asher would want

15:24.507 --> 15:26.843
is for this to evolve into something
that could harm the baby.

(WHIMPERING)

15:29.304 --> 15:31.723

You need this transfusion.

15:32.641 --> 15:33.642
Okay.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.561
Type and cross her for two units.
Start the first unit as soon as it's up.

15:36.645 --> 15:37.812
Got it.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.981
Hang in there.
You're gonna feel better soon.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.066
Mmm-hmm.

15:48.907 --> 15:51.660
Hannah, where are you?
You should've been here hours ago.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.078
You have a patient who needs you.

Listen, whatever your situation is,
just call me. Please.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.918
Just let me know you're okay.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.548
Can't keep this up for much longer.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.342
We're almost set.

16:08.385 --> 16:10.553
-So, what is this?
-Defibrillator.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.971
Now that you're staying in place,

16:12.055 --> 16:14.265
we can send a continuous charge
to your chest, okay?

16:14.349 --> 16:17.227
It'll steady your heart rate long enough
for us to get you to the hospital.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.812
We're good.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.606
All right, Larry.
Here we go.

We need you to get back on the treadmill.

-What? No, no.
-APRIL: Yeah.

16:42.127 --> 16:45.338
Your heart rate is still dangerously low.
You have to keep running to keep it up.

-I can't.
-Hey, Larry. You have no choice.

Come on. Larry, come on! Come on!

So, for an actor who approaches his work
on a molecular level,

I would imagine that every aspect of Lewis

17:36.890 --> 17:40.143
has been carefully researched, crafted,

17:40.226 --> 17:44.522
to give Harper an incredibly
real and loving father.

And that's the role of a lifetime. Right?

22:29.515 --> 22:31.726
and push 50 milligrams of Benadryl.
Should buy us some time.

22:32.560 --> 22:33.561
Where are you going?

22:35.980 --> 22:37.732
I think I know where to find Dr. Asher.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.575
Why's it taking so long?

22:47.658 --> 22:49.535
He's threading a little wire
into your heart.

22:49.619 --> 22:50.828
It's a delicate process.

22:50.912 --> 22:52.205
God.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.956
Just try not to tense up.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.959
Uh, there's something moving in my arm.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.213
-You mean your chest?
-No, my arm, my left arm.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.882
Okay, you must have overshot
the vena cava.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.592
You have to retract the wire
and start again.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.761
What? Start again?

23:06.844 --> 23:08.805
No, no, no. I can't do this anymore.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.598
Larry, just hang in there, okay?

23:10.681 --> 23:12.934
-I can't, I can't, I can't.
-You gotta keep running, Larry.

23:13.017 --> 23:15.269
-No, no, no! Larry!
-Larry, hang in there for a minute.

23:15.353 --> 23:17.271
No, no, no, no.
Don't do this, Larry!

23:17.355 --> 23:19.649
-Finally!
-Hey, help me out, man.

23:21.734 --> 23:22.902
All right, bag him.

23:22.985 --> 23:23.986
All right, I'll get on his chest.

He's not circulating.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.324
Come on.
Retract the wire, start over.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.915
He poisoned himself?

23:35.998 --> 23:39.001
All his labs and symptoms
indicate that he has.

23:39.585 --> 23:43.297
He believes Lewis needs to die
in the presence of his daughter,

23:44.006 --> 23:46.467
so that Harper can say goodbye
and get closure.

23:46.551 --> 23:49.637
Look, you need to tell your daughter
the truth.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.722
I can't. No.

23:51.806 --> 23:52.890
If you end it now,

23:52.974 --> 23:54.976
Derek will have no reason
to play this all out.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.146

that I lied to her,

-she will never trust me again.

Harper can handle the truth.
Trust me.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.738
I'm not saying it's gonna be easy,
but eventually,

24:07.822 --> 24:09.824
she'll understand
and she will forgive you.

24:11.242 --> 24:13.411
All right. But only if he agrees.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.371
Harper will never believe
that Derek is not her dad

24:15.454 --> 24:16.873
unless he is the one that tells her.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.250
Okay. Go and talk to him.
Please.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.878
We can ask a nurse to take Harper
to the cafeteria.

24:21.961 --> 24:22.962
Okay.

and see if that expands the opening,

the wire forward, okay?

-(HEART RATE MONITOR BEEPING)
-DOCTOR: Almost there.

35:18.075 --> 35:20.536
Baby girl. Premature but healthy.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.247
(BABY CRYING)

35:27.376 --> 35:29.419
All right, let's get her to the NICU.

35:32.256 --> 35:33.507
How's Mom?

35:33.590 --> 35:35.759
Sats and pressure are holding steady.
Should be fine.

35:44.017 --> 35:46.353
Hey. How are Siana and the baby?

35:46.436 --> 35:47.604
They're fine.

35:47.688 --> 35:49.398
-Oh, thank God.
-Now?

35:49.481 --> 35:51.441
I just, uh... My phone crashed on me.

35:51.525 --> 35:54.570
I had to get it fixed,
and I caught a flat, it was just...

35:54.653 --> 35:56.947
It was like the perfect storm.
I just could not get in here today.

35:57.030 --> 35:59.533
Your patient and her baby
almost died today

35:59.616 --> 36:01.034
while you were off somewhere getting high.

36:01.118 --> 36:02.286
(CHUCKLES)
High?

36:03.620 --> 36:05.873
I told you, I caught a flat.

36:07.124 --> 36:08.208
You expect me to believe that?

36:08.292 --> 36:10.669
(SCOFFS) You didn't seem
to have a problem last night.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.379
-Yeah, that was a mistake.
-A mistake?

36:12.462 --> 36:14.673
Yeah, and it was a mistake thinking
you'd turn yourself in today.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.217
You know what?
You think whatever you want to.

36:17.301 --> 36:18.844
I need to go check on Siana.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.479
A few hours ago, you were ready
to discharge him.

36:29.563 --> 36:30.564
Now you're telling us he's dead?

36:30.647 --> 36:33.233
The doctors encountered
complications in surgery.

36:33.317 --> 36:34.651
Bleeding, to be specific.

36:34.735 --> 36:36.737
Ultimately, we weren't able
to get it under control.

36:36.820 --> 36:37.988
They did everything they could.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.698
You can explain all that to the AG.

36:40.282 --> 36:43.285
That man belonged to the state of Indiana,
and he died on your watch.

36:45.913 --> 36:47.164
Let's go.

36:52.711 --> 36:56.673
Is there anything I need to know
about what happened in there?

37:00.135 --> 37:01.428
Ms. Goodwin...

37:03.931 --> 37:07.601
I assure you, Dr. Marcel and I
did all we could.

37:09.102 --> 37:10.854
Mmm-hmm.

37:14.399 --> 37:15.984
I'm glad to hear that.

37:28.538 --> 37:29.539
How's he doing?

37:29.623 --> 37:31.959
Dr. Latham was able to implant
a permanent pacemaker.

37:32.042 --> 37:33.418
He should make a full recovery.

37:34.711 --> 37:36.171
Thank God.

37:37.631 --> 37:41.343
He also said that given the circumstances,
it was a very impressive save.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.433
I don't understand.

37:49.142 --> 37:50.811
My daddy's not my daddy?

37:52.646 --> 37:53.772
But he is.

37:53.855 --> 37:56.775
You know, Harper,
it really is kind of confusing.

37:57.359 --> 38:01.029
And it might take a while
for you to understand.

38:01.780 --> 38:05.742
But all you really need to know
is that he loves you very, very much.

38:05.826 --> 38:06.952
I know that.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.038
Can I go see him now?

38:12.874 --> 38:14.167
Okay. (SIGHS)

38:14.251 --> 38:15.836
Yeah, of course.
We can go see him.

38:27.264 --> 38:28.682
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

38:36.106 --> 38:37.232
Hey. You ready?

38:37.315 --> 38:38.525
Yeah.

38:39.443 --> 38:40.736
Listen,

38:40.819 --> 38:42.654
I know we had plans tonight,

38:43.739 --> 38:47.784
but I was wondering if maybe we could
grab a drink with Crockett first.

38:47.868 --> 38:49.286
With Crockett?

38:51.788 --> 38:53.832
I know you don't think
the world of the guy,

38:53.915 --> 38:57.753
but we had a really rough day
on the case today.

38:59.629 --> 39:01.715
Oh. Okay.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.385
-Why don't you go ahead...
-Forget it.

39:05.469 --> 39:07.137
I can do it another time.

39:07.220 --> 39:08.930
-You sure?
-Yeah.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.058
Come on. Let's go home.

39:12.309 --> 39:13.727
We got a date tonight, right?

39:14.394 --> 39:17.522
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah. Okay.

39:34.956 --> 39:36.750
Hey, Earl. You got a minute?

39:37.667 --> 39:39.211
What do you need, Dr. Halstead?

39:40.504 --> 39:41.755
A favor.

39:44.508 --> 39:46.134
OFFICER: Seek. Seek.

39:53.183 --> 39:55.018

39:58.271 --> 39:59.272
You were right.
