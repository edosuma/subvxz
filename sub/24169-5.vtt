WEBVTT

00:15.598 --> 00:18.226
Boone may be a Nazi,
but he's very kind to birds.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.021
Are you having second thoughts
about killing him?

00:21.104 --> 00:24.649
No, we're almost out of the Serb guy.
And Boone idolizes Hitler.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.067
<i>The </i>Hitler.

00:26.651 --> 00:28.945
Gonna eat this bastard tits to teeth.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.614
-"Tits to teeth?"
-It's an expression.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.492
-It means to eat all of something.
-No, baby, not that I've heard.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.871
-"Gums to thumbs"?
-Sure.

00:37.954 --> 00:40.040
Do you see a way for us
to get the body out?

00:40.123 --> 00:41.124
<i>Well, it's gonna be tough.</i>

00:41.207 --> 00:43.042
There's no alley,
there's a lot of foot traffic,

00:43.126 --> 00:47.255
and there's a 7-Eleven on the corner,
so night's not gonna be any better.

00:47.964 --> 00:51.176
Killing people is hard.
I used to think that was a good thing.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.514
-They're opening up Japopo's. I gotta go.
-What's your plan?

00:56.598 --> 00:59.642
I'm gonna get their receipts and find out
if anybody else ordered the clams

00:59.726 --> 01:02.479
the same night as you and Ramona.
If they did, I'll track them down.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.689
And if they turned,
we'll know it was the clams.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.776
Then, I'll try to save humanity,
tits to teeth.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.569
Well, I heard it somewhere.

01:09.652 --> 01:10.862
Mm-hmm.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.614
<i>But what's your plan to get the receipts?</i>

01:13.198 --> 01:15.575
You're not gonna pretend
you're a health inspector, are you?

01:15.658 --> 01:18.244
No. But why would that be bad?

01:18.328 --> 01:20.246
Because they would ask for ID.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.249
Right. We had the same reason.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.008
[bell chimes]

01:32.091 --> 01:33.593
You're hanging out in the walk-in freezer?

01:33.676 --> 01:34.886
-Don't do it.
-Hello.

01:36.554 --> 01:39.182
I'm a documentary filmmaker
working on a movie

01:39.265 --> 01:41.810
about tipping in the restaurant industry.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.895
I was recently in England
where they don't tip at all.

01:43.978 --> 01:46.147
So that's been interesting.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.566
A whole documentary on tipping?

01:48.650 --> 01:50.944
It may expand to other areas.

01:51.027 --> 01:54.030
Race. Ageism. What have you. Angels.

01:54.697 --> 01:58.243
Oh, my wife loves angels. She once
thought she saw one in Yosemite.

01:58.326 --> 01:59.786
Incredible.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.413
I might want to interview her on camera.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.623
That'd be great.

02:03.706 --> 02:04.791
Done.

02:04.874 --> 02:08.169
In the meantime, I'd love to see
your receipts from the past three weeks.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.923
I guess that'd be okay.
I mean, it's for my wife's movie, right?

02:12.674 --> 02:13.716
[man chuckles]

02:14.384 --> 02:15.218
[whispering]

02:19.514 --> 02:22.475
You wrote a scathing Yelp review
about us.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.519
My cook recognized you
from your picture.

02:25.770 --> 02:26.729
Yes, I did.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.149
Would your wife be available
for an interview tomorrow?

02:29.232 --> 02:30.400
You need to write me a better review.

02:30.483 --> 02:33.820
The thing is,
I have Yelp Elite Member status.

02:33.903 --> 02:36.030
So the integrity of my reviews--

02:36.114 --> 02:39.409
You know what?
I'll write you a good review.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.704
No, no, no, not on your phone,
Mr. Integrity. Put some time into it.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.874
Come back tonight.
If I like it, I'll give you the receipts.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.336
Fine. But people like you are the reason

02:50.420 --> 02:52.755
documentary filmmaking
is dying in this country.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.469
-Sheila. Sheila...
-Mm-hmm? Yeah?

02:58.553 --> 02:59.429
Time!

03:00.388 --> 03:02.974
I gotta get to work, girlie.
You're fun to spar with.

03:03.057 --> 03:05.643
You hit for, like, 20 minutes.
You're not even tired.

03:05.727 --> 03:09.314
I have a lot of energy lately.
I gave up dairy. Again tomorrow?

03:09.397 --> 03:14.819
-Yeah, sure. Gotta keep in shape.
-I can imagine so, being a sheriff.

03:14.903 --> 03:18.573
What? Oh, no.
We mostly just sit in a car all day.

03:18.656 --> 03:22.201
I was talking about Lisa.
She's a very physical and energetic lover.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.786
I'm beginning to think she killed Dan.

03:25.455 --> 03:29.709
-We're dating, by the way.
-Oh, well, congratulations.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.296
Speaking of Dan,
any news on the investigation?

03:33.379 --> 03:37.300
Nope. But a lot of people have
gone missing from Santa Clarita lately.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.428
-Too many, if you ask me.
-Is anyone asking you?

03:40.511 --> 03:43.056
No. I suggested we start a task force

03:43.139 --> 03:44.933
to see if any of these disappearances
are connected,

03:45.016 --> 03:47.185
but my boss won't listen to me.
I'm just a deputy.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.147
Wow. Frustrating. Sounds like
a lost cause. You should let that go.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.900
Focus more on you.
What makes Anne happy?

03:53.983 --> 03:55.318
Christ's infinite love.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.320
Yeah, He's great. What else?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.614
I like to paint.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.783
Well, put your energy into that!
What else?

04:01.866 --> 04:04.327
-I like gardening.
-Well, then you should grow some flowers,

04:04.410 --> 04:07.121
put them in a vase
and paint that shit. What else?

04:07.205 --> 04:09.666
-I love solving mysteries.
-Next!

04:09.749 --> 04:12.001
You know what, you're right, Sheila.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.963
I'm gonna do what I want and I'm gonna
look into these missing people myself

04:15.046 --> 04:16.506
and see if there's a connection.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.342
No. You should plant and paint.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.094
You'll be too tired for anything else.

04:21.177 --> 04:23.012
Not if I quit dairy, like you.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.764
You are so inspiring.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.520
I'll get you a bonsai tree.
That's gardening and art. Fuck.

04:30.603 --> 04:34.232
[Rick] "The angels in heaven
would surely give up their wings

04:34.315 --> 04:37.110
for one trip to Japopo's
all-you-can-eat penne bar."

04:37.694 --> 04:39.195
-It's good.
-Really?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.030
-You're being sarcastic, right?
-No.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.032
-Then it's bad.
-Shit.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.619
Writing this is so much harder
than I thought it would be.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.372
Hey, you wanna smoke a little?

04:49.455 --> 04:52.000
Get the creative juices going.
It's been a while.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.460
No, I gotta stay focused.
If we get high,

04:54.544 --> 04:56.421
we'll just end up
designing sneakers again.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.214
Okay, what is going on with you?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.174
You don't wanna smoke,
you were in the hospital,

05:00.258 --> 05:02.343
now you're writing a good review
for a place you once called

05:02.427 --> 05:03.511
"thunderously mundane."

05:03.594 --> 05:05.096
[Joel sighs]

05:05.179 --> 05:06.639
I don't wanna lie to you anymore.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.349
-Good.
-But I can't tell ya.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.059
-Seriously?
-I'm sorry.

05:11.644 --> 05:12.478
All right.

05:13.062 --> 05:13.896
Thanks, Rick.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.773
Yeah. Just don't disappear on me, man.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.483
I'm trying not to.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.735
-[Rick] Mm.
-Oh.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.821
You guys are hugging. That's so nice.
Don't stop on my account,

05:21.904 --> 05:24.824
but when you're done, Joel,
I really need to talk to you.

05:26.659 --> 05:27.869
We're good.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.372
[Sheila] Bye-bye, Rick.

05:32.206 --> 05:34.000
So, I was boxing with Anne,

05:34.083 --> 05:38.880
and she thinks that all the missing people
in Santa Clarita might be connected.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.221
-Shit!
-I tried to convince her to let it go.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.933
But with almost poetic irony,
I inspired her to get to the bottom of it.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.771
Jesus. I told you, you shouldn't be
friends with a cop. It's too dangerous.

05:54.854 --> 05:58.191
Said by the man who was just wrapped
in a warm embrace with a cop.

05:58.816 --> 05:59.984
That's different.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.653
Anne is an intense
and ambitious sheriff's deputy.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.656
Rick joined the Santa Monica Police
so he could ride a horse on the beach.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.867
Well, we can sit around and play
the blame game.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.577
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you're wrong.

06:09.660 --> 06:10.828
You're the one who put us at risk.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.413
-How am I wrong?
-I thought we just agreed

06:12.497 --> 06:14.165
we weren't gonna play that game.

06:14.248 --> 06:16.501
What's important now
is that we have to be careful

06:16.584 --> 06:18.669
because Anne is interested in our crime.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.506
-For a reason that's nobody's fault.
-Yours.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.883
That aside, we have been getting sloppy.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.844
That Serb you killed in here?
I put his shoes on this morning.

06:26.928 --> 06:30.848
And we have Gary's head and a mutant
spider ball with legs in the basement.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.643
We have to get everything incriminating
out of the house.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.937
And if it's not safe to kill that Nazi,
we're not doing it.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.689
-You're right. It's just...
-It's just what?

06:39.273 --> 06:40.733
I want to.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.319
Good morning, outlaws.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.490
Hey, Abby, I want to talk to you
about yesterday.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.868
When you were choking Ramona
with your belt, that was quite a moment.

06:50.952 --> 06:54.247
Yeah, I also flagged that as something
to circle back to. How you feeling?

06:54.330 --> 06:56.124
Fine. I saved my best friend's life.

06:56.791 --> 07:00.378
I promise not to make a habit
of choking people. Okay? But I'm late.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.964
-Okay, well, we worry about you.
-Don't.

07:03.798 --> 07:04.841
I'm okay.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.847
Listen, Abs, our day just got
kind of busy.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.682
So could we put you in charge
of dinner tonight?

07:12.765 --> 07:16.018
Sure, and since I'm in charge,
I want you to order in Thai food, okay?

07:16.102 --> 07:17.478
Love you, bye.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.815
Man, I just got handled.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.693
-Ordering in.
-I know, and it happened so fast.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.445
No, we should try that.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.030
If it's too risky to kill Boone
at his house,

07:28.114 --> 07:29.740
we should have him delivered.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.075
Interesting. Go on.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.077
Well, now that Anne is looking
into things,

07:33.161 --> 07:34.287
which something that just happened,

07:34.370 --> 07:37.373
let's move on,
we need to rethink our whole operation.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.334
I agree. We have been erring
on the side of incompetence.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.379
-Some of us more than others.
-So I was thinking, screw you,

07:43.463 --> 07:47.467
<i>we get a storage unit</i>
<i>that's just dedicated to killing.</i>

07:49.051 --> 07:51.053
<i>Then we line the room with plastic...</i>

07:54.724 --> 07:59.228
<i>and move the freezer into it,</i>
<i>so we can easily clean everything up.</i>

08:00.480 --> 08:04.192
<i>Next, we move Gary's head</i>
<i>and Mr. Ball Legs out of our basement</i>

08:04.275 --> 08:06.152
<i>and put them in our old storage unit.</i>

08:06.235 --> 08:07.862
[Gary sputtering]

08:09.864 --> 08:12.283
-Why do I have to move?
-You'll be happier here.

08:12.366 --> 08:14.285
-It's like having your own place.
-Yeah, sure.

08:14.368 --> 08:17.246
-Is that what you told the Bowflex?
-We'll get you a TV.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.749
Maybe plug in a lava lamp.

08:19.832 --> 08:23.085
-Groovy.
-You barely visited me in the basement.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.171
Are you ever gonna visit me
when I'm halfway across town?

08:25.254 --> 08:29.091
-Of course, we will, Gary.
-It's only a chore if you make it a chore.

08:29.926 --> 08:34.180
[Sheila] <i>Then, we find a way to lure Boone</i>
<i>into the kill room.</i>

08:34.263 --> 08:38.184
-Should we add a swastika?
-I don't want to draw a swastika.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.103
Well, we should add something intolerant.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.945
[Sheila] <i>Then, we let Nazis be Nazis.</i>

08:53.157 --> 08:54.450
Hey. I'm white.

08:56.619 --> 09:01.165
Hey, Eric. So I was looking in the paper
for more missing people, you know,

09:01.249 --> 09:04.335
just, like, seeing what my mom and dad
are up to, and I found this article.

09:04.418 --> 09:07.129
Did you know they're gonna start
fracking, like, four miles from here?

09:07.213 --> 09:09.215
Yeah, we've been talking about it
in Environmental Club.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.884
Fracking is a heinous defilement
of the planet.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.678
Although,
the science behind it is exquisite.

09:13.761 --> 09:17.974
Abby, there's a rumor you were expelled
for whacking Christian with that tray.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.476
And Bobby Ramirez said that
the school put a chip in your neck.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.562
I'm not getting expelled.
No teachers saw it.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.397
And Bobby Ramirez
says a lot of weird stuff

09:24.480 --> 09:28.442
-since he got hit with that Smart Car.
-Hi, Sarah. Eric Bemis.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.238
There's another rumor that Christian
was crying in the locker room,

09:32.321 --> 09:33.781
but then other people said that
it wasn't him.

09:33.864 --> 09:36.075
It was just some random guy that
doesn't even go to this school,

09:36.158 --> 09:36.993
who's blind.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.036
Don't people have more important things
to talk about?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.997
They're gonna start fracking
in Santa Clarita.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.582
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

09:43.165 --> 09:46.877
-You don't know what fracking is, do you?
-I know it's, like, super cancery.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.422
They inject poisonous chemicals
into the ground to break up rock

09:49.505 --> 09:51.549
and release natural gas. Eric Bemis.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.926
Yeah, it causes earthquakes,
it pollutes the groundwater.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.262
It's messed up.
Someone needs to stop them.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.180
People shouldn't be able to do
whatever they want

09:58.264 --> 09:59.682
and just get away with it.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.601
[woman's voice] <i>Abby Hammond</i>
<i>to the principal's office.</i>

10:02.184 --> 10:03.019
Oh.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.313
Sounds like somebody's
getting her chip reprogrammed.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.230
Yeah.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.695
Eric Bemis.

10:15.865 --> 10:16.699
Nope.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.248
"Japopo's has it all.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.960
There's fish from the ocean,
and meat from the land."

10:28.419 --> 10:29.462
This sucks.

10:30.212 --> 10:33.424
Joel. I just heard from Boone.
He got the flyer. It worked!

10:33.507 --> 10:37.261
He's gonna swing by the storage unit
at 4:00. It's happening, baby.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.931
We're going premeditated.
We're going pre-med.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.975
Yay, first-degree.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.102
It's kind of ironic.

10:45.186 --> 10:49.106
The more care you put into a murder,
the harsher society judges you.

10:49.190 --> 10:52.568
And you'd be proud of me
because Carl just mansplained to me

10:52.652 --> 10:54.028
how to work a lockbox.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.614
I smiled, said "thank you,"

10:56.697 --> 10:59.742
and didn't pull out the vocal cords
he used to insult me.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.036
Somebody's ready for an audience
with the Pope.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.455
You were right.
I was overly impulsive.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.123
Including my friendship with Anne.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.418
[sighs] It's too risky.
I'm gonna break it off.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.713
Good.
I appreciate you taking responsibility.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.548
We really do have to be careful, honey.

11:14.632 --> 11:18.052
We have to watch what we say
and who we say it to.

11:18.135 --> 11:18.969
[Ron] Joel?

11:20.596 --> 11:22.890
Ron? They let you out?

11:22.973 --> 11:24.850
Yeah. Budget cuts!

11:24.934 --> 11:27.478
I saw you coming out
of Japopo's this morning,

11:27.561 --> 11:30.439
and I was like, "That is my friend Joel
from the mental hospital.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.899
I wonder how he is."

11:31.982 --> 11:33.192
[gasps]

11:33.275 --> 11:34.902
Is this your wife? The-- the...

11:34.985 --> 11:37.571
[imitates zombie snarling]

11:42.993 --> 11:43.994
Brains.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.584
[chuckles]

11:51.627 --> 11:53.129
Can I talk to you for a minute?

11:54.922 --> 11:56.382
Yes, my love?

11:56.465 --> 11:57.883
I'm gonna tell you what I think happened,

11:57.967 --> 12:00.177
and then you can correct me
if I'm wrong. All right?

12:00.261 --> 12:01.512
Of course, my darling.

12:01.595 --> 12:04.598
You gave me a hard time for
befriending Anne, which could expose us,

12:04.682 --> 12:08.394
while knowing full well
you told this guy that I was undead,

12:08.477 --> 12:10.896
which totally exposes us.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.481
Am I missing anything?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.442
Okay, I'm sorry, but...

12:15.359 --> 12:16.235
[Ron clicks his tongue]

12:16.902 --> 12:21.449
He's crazy. I figured if he ever did
get out, nobody would believe him, anyway.

12:21.532 --> 12:24.410
"I'm sorry, but" is not an apology.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.287
You totally gave me up.

12:26.370 --> 12:29.582
You put both of us in jeopardy.
And the way you described me?

12:29.665 --> 12:30.749
[groaning]

12:30.833 --> 12:34.879
Brains? I go for the guts first.
Or do you even listen to me?

12:34.962 --> 12:38.090
Okay. You're mad. I'll go talk to Ron.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.968
And I love you. We don't say that enough.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.970
Just casually. But it's true.

12:43.053 --> 12:43.888
Go!

12:45.973 --> 12:47.475
[chuckles]

12:47.558 --> 12:51.395
Listen, Ron. Last time we saw each other,
I was a little out of it.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.023
My wife is not undead.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.232
Right. Got it.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.444
So I actually know some people
in paranormal circles

12:58.527 --> 13:00.029
that would love to meet her.

13:00.112 --> 13:03.240
Maybe watch her eat someone.
[gasps] Wouldn't that be a treat?

13:03.324 --> 13:06.035
She's not undead.
And if you tell anyone she is,

13:06.118 --> 13:07.495
right before she kills me,

13:07.578 --> 13:11.874
-I'm gonna kill you. You understand?
-Okay. Jeez, I won't say anything.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.542
-You promise?
-Yes.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.546
Let's not let that come
between what we have.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.341
You hungry? You wanna share a hoagie?

13:22.259 --> 13:24.261
No, I probably shouldn't.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.349
She's a little upset.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.644
See, she became friends with a cop,

13:31.727 --> 13:35.022
which I thought
was really dangerous because--

13:35.105 --> 13:38.108
You know what? Fuck this.
I'm done telling you things.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.862
I have conducted a thorough investigation

13:41.946 --> 13:44.156
into the violent incident in the lunchroom
yesterday.

13:44.240 --> 13:49.620
And while I have evidence to expel you,
if you confess, I may show mercy.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.248
I'm gonna call your bluff.
I don't think you have anything.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.376
You behaved like a rabid dog,
it will not stand. Confess.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.586
If you had any proof,
you would've called my parents in.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.839
-Confess.
-No.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.262
Okay, I don't have any evidence.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.598
So I cannot punish you
for your tray outburst.

14:09.682 --> 14:13.227
But you have several unexcused absences,
which I can punish you for.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.396
-So, how about...
-[pen clicking]

14:15.479 --> 14:17.982
-...a month of detention? Mm.
-A month?

14:18.732 --> 14:20.401
Principal Novak, please,

14:20.484 --> 14:23.654
my family is going through
this very complicated thing right now.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.447
I don't wanna be away from home
that much.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.492
Oh, not such a Cocky Carolyn now,
are we, hmm?

14:30.077 --> 14:31.453
-Good afternoon.
-Eric!

14:31.537 --> 14:32.746
[chuckles]

14:32.830 --> 14:36.125
What brings you here? Oh, wait, wait,
wait. Would you care for a <i>paczki?</i>

14:36.625 --> 14:39.003
There's chocolate in the center.
Don't be surprised.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.880
No, thank you.
I'm just here on Abby's behalf

14:40.963 --> 14:42.089
to make sure she's treated fairly.

14:42.673 --> 14:46.427
Too late. He called me a "rabid dog"
and gave me a month of detention.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.804
My decision and my analogy both stand.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.015
Eric, would you care to take a dive
in the candy drawer?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.226
After your heroics
at the Science Olympiad last week,

14:54.310 --> 14:56.437
-you certainly deserve it.
-No, thank you.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.273
Maybe we can figure out something
for Abby to do besides detention.

14:59.356 --> 15:01.442
What if she joined
the Environmental Club instead?

15:01.525 --> 15:02.735
That's a great idea.

15:02.818 --> 15:06.864
Sorry, madam,
the loose goose does not escape the moose.

15:07.656 --> 15:08.866
-Noose.
-What?

15:09.533 --> 15:11.160
Are you sure we can't work something out?

15:11.243 --> 15:12.828
Because it'd just be such a shame

15:12.912 --> 15:15.372
if I didn't compete
in the final Science Olympiad this year.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.130
Oh, my God. Thank you.
You saved me.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.341
And the way you stood up to Novak!
Holy shit.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.217
I was trying to channel the swagger
of Eddie Redmayne

15:27.301 --> 15:30.220
in <i>The Theory of Everything</i>
before he got Lou Gehrig's Disease.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.223
You know, that totally came through.
I like this side of you.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.224
You were a badass.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.269
"Eric the Badass." I like it.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.522
"Son of Lisa the Pharma Rep.
Neighbor of Joel."

15:40.606 --> 15:42.608
Put that on a shield
and fight dragons with it.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.027
I would really love that. So I'll see you
at lunch in the Environmental Club?

15:45.110 --> 15:47.112
Yeah. We're gonna get those frackers.
Tits to teeth.

15:47.571 --> 15:48.739
Hmm?

15:48.822 --> 15:51.408
-I told my mom that was a thing.
-Okay.

15:53.661 --> 15:57.539
-Hey. Tray girl, right?
-Oh, Abby.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.666
I'm Sven.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.336
That was really cool what you did
to Christian in the cafeteria yesterday.

16:02.419 --> 16:03.462
Oh. [chuckles]

16:03.545 --> 16:04.672
Thank you.

16:04.755 --> 16:08.300
-You didn't think it was too extreme?
-Oh, it was definitely too extreme.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.428
That's what made it so awesome.
That guy's been a dick since sixth grade.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.681
It's really nice to see someone finally
take him down.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.850
Uh, I'm Abby.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.729
-Yeah, you said. I'm still Sven.
-Right. [chuckles]

16:21.897 --> 16:24.483
Tell me something I don't know, Tray Girl.
Like your phone number.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.610
Oh, my God. That's so good.

16:29.613 --> 16:32.282
[suspenseful music playing]

16:34.535 --> 16:37.496
So, I'm thinking, Boone walks in,
[deep voice] "Hey, fuckers.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.832
Where's your Nazi memorabilia, fuckers?"

16:39.915 --> 16:41.959
[normal voice] And then when he crosses
to the trunk

16:42.042 --> 16:45.254
and bends down to open it,
one of us takes a bite out of his neck.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.631
-I suggest, me.
-So what do I do?

16:47.715 --> 16:49.258
Oh! You'll be running around

16:49.341 --> 16:51.218
telling strangers that your wife
is undead.

16:51.301 --> 16:55.514
-I said I was sorry about Ron.
-No. You said, "I'm sorry, but..."

16:55.973 --> 16:58.767
That's not an apology,
that's a rationalization.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.563
Here's a way to remember it.
Inside of every "but" is an asshole.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.189
That's very helpful.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.693
However, we should drop it
because Boone will be here any minute.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.111
Fine.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.115
I think our kill room looks too much
like a kill room.

17:13.198 --> 17:16.160
Yeah. Feels like we copied it
from a kill room catalogue.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.295
-I could add a basket of seashells.
-Might warm it up.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.589
[vehicle approaches]

17:28.672 --> 17:29.506
-Too late.
-[gasps]

17:29.590 --> 17:31.717
He's here. This is it.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.927
-Going pre-med, baby.
-[chuckles]

17:35.679 --> 17:36.638
[Sheila gasps]

17:36.722 --> 17:40.017
Holy shit! It's you guys. Kayla's friends.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.812
Boone? Oh, I didn't recognize your voice
on the phone.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.565
What a small world. Honey, it's Boone.

17:46.648 --> 17:50.110
It is Boone! Hey, Boone. Booney Tunes.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.072
-What's with all the plastic?
-Oh, it's a clean room.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.116
It's what museums do
to protect their priceless artifacts.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.787
-We used to be curators.
-Oh. Did you lose your jobs to Mexicans?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.164
-[Sheila sighs]
-Wow.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.334
You need to go over there right now
and look inside that trunk.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.087
-Yeah, go on now. Lots to see--
-Not so fast.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.379
What's wrong?

18:12.257 --> 18:14.635
I gotta get my friend.
He's the expert on this stuff.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.680
-He brought a friend?
-He didn't tell me

18:18.764 --> 18:19.765
he was going to bring a friend.

18:19.848 --> 18:22.392
-We can't kill two people.
-Well, we can't not kill them.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.310
That trunk is empty.

18:23.393 --> 18:26.188
And as soon as they go look inside,
they're gonna know something's up.

18:26.271 --> 18:29.650
What if we tell them that's Hitler's
fruit basket and Goebbels' fern?

18:30.234 --> 18:32.778
I know we're spitballing,
but that's terrible.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.948
-Agreed.
-We're just gonna go for it. New plan.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.242
I'm gonna kill the one guy
while you distract the other,

18:38.325 --> 18:42.246
-and then I'm gonna kill him, too.
-Jesus. That's barely a plan.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.998
We can do this. Come on,
these guys are Nazis,

18:45.082 --> 18:46.834
we still have the moral high ground.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.252
[ramp whirring]

18:56.969 --> 18:59.638
What if one of the Nazis
is in a wheelchair?

18:59.721 --> 19:03.183
God, I hope that's an oddly-timed
philosophical question.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.144
No. Boone's buddy is in a wheelchair.

19:06.937 --> 19:10.107
Hmm. Did this just get easier or harder?

19:10.190 --> 19:13.235
I don't know. Killing someone
in a wheelchair might be a hate crime.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.029
Well, these are Nazis.
They invented hate crimes.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.198
Still, killing him feels discriminatory.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.285
Or is it discriminatory not to kill him?

19:21.368 --> 19:24.204
He wouldn't wanna be treated unequally
because he's disabled.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.249
Or would he want that
because then he would be alive?

19:27.332 --> 19:29.501
I guess if we're on the fence,
we shouldn't do it.

19:29.585 --> 19:33.130
Yeah, let's get them out of here,
then go read up on moral relativism.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.758
-This is Kevin.
-Hey.

19:37.467 --> 19:40.179
Boone says you guys are curators.
I bet you have great stuff.

19:40.762 --> 19:44.057
Actually, there's been a change of plans.
We're no longer selling.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.477
What the fuck are you talking about?
We drove all the way up from Long Beach.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.104
I missed physical therapy.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.565
You know how hard it is to book
a white nurse?

19:53.400 --> 19:55.027
I hear the annoyance in your voice.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.404
The demographics in that industry
are changing.

19:57.487 --> 20:03.076
Still, we've decided to donate
our memorabilia to an orphanage.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.453
A Nazi orphanage.

20:05.495 --> 20:06.997
That's bullshit.

20:07.080 --> 20:11.501
Well, actually, Kevin, we reserve
the right to refuse service to anyone.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.045
Let go of my handles, bitch.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.755
There must be something really good
in there

20:14.838 --> 20:17.591
if you don't even want us to look.
Maybe we'll just take it.

20:17.674 --> 20:18.675
Boone. Stop!

20:19.593 --> 20:21.637
Think of the Nazi children!

20:22.638 --> 20:23.805
I know what's going on here.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.892
You were all set to sell
till you saw me in this wheelchair.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.311
-[both] What?
-This is discrimination.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.896
You're discriminating against me.

20:30.979 --> 20:34.650
We don't discriminate.
You people discriminate.

20:34.733 --> 20:35.567
"You people"?

20:36.109 --> 20:38.904
-You mean people in wheelchairs?
-No, I don't care about the wheelchair.

20:38.987 --> 20:39.988
Shame on you,

20:40.072 --> 20:43.742
treating a whole group of people
like they're second-class citizens.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.619
You're worse than my Jew landlord.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.079
Do you hear yourself?

20:47.162 --> 20:51.333
I don't want to be treated differently
than anybody else, you gypsy-nosed cunt!

20:52.751 --> 20:53.585
I mean...

20:55.462 --> 20:58.548
May I show you
Hitler's favorite fruit basket?

20:58.632 --> 21:01.677
[screaming]

21:03.428 --> 21:06.014
-What the fuck?
-It's wicker.

21:08.392 --> 21:09.893
-[Sheila growling]
-[screaming]

21:18.277 --> 21:19.111
Okay, then.

21:21.738 --> 21:25.033
I'm going to step out.
Text me when you're done.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.910
[Sheila snarling]

21:28.912 --> 21:30.289
Stop fracking, start snacking.

21:30.998 --> 21:35.085
Brownies, three for a dollar.
Less than it costs to make them.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.171
-I feel like this is a waste of time.
-What are you talking about?

21:38.255 --> 21:41.091
We only need to sell 30 more lemon squares
to buy a promoted Tweet.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.009
Yeah, I'm out.

21:42.759 --> 21:43.802
Abby, where are you going?

21:43.885 --> 21:45.595
I promised Novak you'd join
Environmental Club.

21:45.679 --> 21:49.349
No. I'm "Tray Girl." I need to do
something more intense than a Tweet.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.601
Something that might actually
stop fracking, like...

21:52.102 --> 21:54.438
chain myself to something,
or stop eating something,

21:54.521 --> 21:56.606
or eat a lot of something.
I don't know. I'll figure it out.

21:56.690 --> 22:00.277
Wait. Whatever it is, I'll do it with you.

22:01.486 --> 22:02.321
Are you sure?

22:02.404 --> 22:05.824
Yeah. As you saw with Novak,
I can handle intense.

22:05.907 --> 22:08.410
I'm "Eric the Badass.
Son of Lisa the Pharma Rep...

22:09.286 --> 22:10.329
Friend of Abby."

22:11.872 --> 22:13.582
You're all of those things.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.210
-Let's get out of here.
-So, "Tray Girl"?

22:17.294 --> 22:20.547
-Is that what people are calling you now?
-Some people.

22:20.630 --> 22:21.506
Huh.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.305
[sighs]

22:29.222 --> 22:32.559
You're sighing a lot over there, chief.
No valentines in your mailbox?

22:32.642 --> 22:35.520
Trying to find
a change of clothes for Sheila.

22:36.188 --> 22:39.149
[sighs] I just watched my wife
do something.

22:39.232 --> 22:42.402
I've seen her do this thing before,
but it's not something I ever get used to.

22:42.986 --> 22:46.239
Joel. I saw your gal eat her way
into my stomach.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.324
You don't have to be coy.

22:47.407 --> 22:50.243
She ripped two dudes' throats out
of their necks like they were Twizzlers.

22:50.327 --> 22:51.203
Whoa.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.205
You can't unsee that.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.540
She gets this look in her eye.

22:56.291 --> 22:59.044
The next thing you know,
she's yanking intestines out of these guys

22:59.127 --> 23:01.755
like a magician pulling out scarves.
[chuckles]

23:01.838 --> 23:04.382
The other day, I came home
and my kitchen looked like

23:04.466 --> 23:07.135
someone shot a person
out of a confetti gun.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.846
-There was a dick in my fruit bowl.
-Oh.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.557
The next morning,
I'm eating oatmeal at the same counter

23:12.641 --> 23:15.018
like my life is
<i>Leave it to Fucking Beaver.</i>

23:15.685 --> 23:17.479
I guess somebody did need to talk.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.863
It's not like I can talk about this
to my friends.

23:27.572 --> 23:30.492
I told this guy Ron about it,
and it turned into a shitstorm.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.995
Yeah, it can be lonely
not having anyone to talk to.

23:34.621 --> 23:38.333
For me, being buried alive
was kind of an isolating experience.

23:38.416 --> 23:42.295
Again, sorry about that, but we
didn't know about killing the brain.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.547
Joel...

23:43.630 --> 23:46.091
"Sorry, but..." is not a real apology.

23:49.761 --> 23:54.724
Well, I wouldn't call them a master race,
but delicious.

23:57.018 --> 24:01.106
[sighs] We did it.
Our new plan is going to work.

24:01.189 --> 24:02.107
Listen...

24:06.236 --> 24:09.072
I shouldn't have given you a hard time
about making friends with Anne.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.701
Really? Where did that come from?

24:12.784 --> 24:14.411
-[Gary clears his throat] Gary.
-It's just...

24:15.162 --> 24:18.498
we live this secret life, and that
can make us feel alone sometimes.

24:18.582 --> 24:21.084
So I get why you'd wanna reach out
to people.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.046
-Is that why you talked to Ron?
-That doesn't excuse it.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.840
I shouldn't have told him about you.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.676
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

24:30.135 --> 24:30.969
Full stop.

24:33.096 --> 24:35.474
I want to kiss you so badly right now

24:36.391 --> 24:37.726
but I have Nazi-breath.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.437
Huh.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.688
I was wrong.

24:41.771 --> 24:44.900
Yes, we agreed on that.
Thank you for saying it.

24:44.983 --> 24:48.695
No, I mean, I was wrong.
That's all anybody wants to hear.

24:55.535 --> 24:58.705
So, tell us about
this undead woman that you met.

24:58.788 --> 24:59.873
Yeah, what's her name?

24:59.956 --> 25:01.041
She...

25:04.044 --> 25:05.837
-wouldn't want me to tell you.
-Ron.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.797
I'm sorry. I can no longer discuss it.

25:07.881 --> 25:12.886
Buddy, you called us.
We UberPooled all the way up from Irvine.

25:13.595 --> 25:17.515
And somebody talked to Tom
from Reseda the entire two hours.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.643
Well, maybe somebody would like
to be heard for once.

25:19.726 --> 25:22.562
Well, I hope it wasn't Tom
because he didn't get a word in.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.899
So, Ron, if you don't give us
something useful,

25:25.982 --> 25:28.777
I will personally ban you
from the Paranormal subreddit.

25:28.860 --> 25:29.903
-[gasps]
-[Marsha] That's right.

25:29.986 --> 25:33.073
You won't be able to post.
You won't be able to upvote or downvote.

25:33.156 --> 25:35.617
-It'll be like you're dead.
-No. Please.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.702
Buddy, we know this is real.

25:38.787 --> 25:42.707
All right, there are people
in Santa Clarita looking for Serbian bile.

25:43.625 --> 25:46.670
So whatever you can tell us
would be greatly appreciated.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.047
All right.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.843
I saw her husband
coming out of this restaurant yesterday

25:53.927 --> 25:56.346
and he seemed very agitated.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.890
-Agitated.
-Interesting.

26:04.688 --> 26:08.984
We have to find these people.
It's our sacred task.

26:10.443 --> 26:12.028
[sighs] Excuse me.

26:12.862 --> 26:16.533
I'm sorry, I hate to be that guy,
but I asked for my dressing on the side.
