00:00.780 --> 00:01.960
Alan, Shirley.

00:01.960 --> 00:02.600
Lorraine.

00:02.600 --> 00:05.140
I suppose it was inevitable
we'd finally bump heads a bit.

00:05.180 --> 00:06.930
This was just assigned
to us by the court.

00:06.970 --> 00:09.250
Indigent client— old lawyer
jumped in front of a bus—

00:09.290 --> 00:10.600
now he needs a new one.

00:10.640 --> 00:11.590
Did you not commit this crime?

00:11.630 --> 00:13.360
Why aren't you pleading this case out?

00:13.400 --> 00:14.010
He's innocent.

00:14.050 --> 00:15.060
Alan, you take over.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.630
Me? What about Jerry?

00:16.630 --> 00:18.630
If there's a hope, it's not Katie Lloyd.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.680
Katie Lloyd will be my lawyer.

00:20.680 --> 00:25.230
Dr Rivers, several people have stated that
Joseph Washington seemed obsessed with your wife.

00:25.270 --> 00:27.550
Did you ever see indications of this?
–No.

00:27.590 --> 00:29.834
He always struck me as a nice man.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:39.020 --> 00:42.460
We have what is called a
presumption of innence in this country,

00:42.500 --> 00:47.460
but I doubt many of you presume
Joseph Washington is innocent.

00:47.460 --> 00:50.840
I mean, when you think about it, he
was arrested and brought to trial

00:50.880 --> 00:55.040
because the police and the district
attorney are quite convinced he's guilty.

00:55.080 --> 00:58.340
And since the prosecution
gets to go first,

00:58.340 --> 01:01.010
the 12 of you might
be equally predisposed,

01:01.050 --> 01:04.680
if you're not already, long before the
defense ever gets to present its side.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.020
Stop.

01:06.350 --> 01:08.020
Why make that concession?

01:08.020 --> 01:13.350
Well, I thought better to share with them
the idea it's okay to think he's guilty—

01:13.390 --> 01:18.550
Never concede that your client looks guilty
and never give the jury permission to think so.

01:18.590 --> 01:21.800
The police are serving up Joseph
Washington because they've got nobody else.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.380
That's why we're here.

01:23.380 --> 01:26.050
A rich doctor's wife was
killed in a safe neighborhood.

01:26.090 --> 01:28.520
Somebody's got to go to jail, whether
it's the right person or not.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.750
But wouldn't it help our credibility
if we admit,“okay, he looks guilty”?

01:31.790 --> 01:34.050
But guilt is a legal term, Katie.

01:34.050 --> 01:37.690
It suggests that the
prosecution has met its burden.

01:38.250 --> 01:39.360
Maybe you should do this.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.370
I would, but the client insists on you.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.110
Or— or Jerry.

01:43.150 --> 01:45.470
No. You.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.600
This thing starts in ten hours.

01:52.620 --> 01:54.860
Are you a lawyer or not?

01:58.870 --> 02:02.480
–I'm a lawyer.
–Yes, you are.

02:03.010 --> 02:08.530
The 12 people sitting in this box need to
trust you when you say, “let my client go,”

02:08.570 --> 02:12.720
and that will never happen
if you don't trust yourself.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.430
Shall we listen to it from the top?

02:18.470 --> 02:19.640
Okay.

02:24.100 --> 02:26.420
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

02:26.420 --> 02:30.776
We have what is called a presumption
of innocence in this country.

02:35.290 --> 02:36.590
I'm okay.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.170
Oh, dear.

Season04 Episode02
The Innocent Man

03:13.590 --> 03:15.360
<i>What do you mean,</i> she fainted?

03:15.400 --> 03:18.390
She didn't completely
lose consciousness but—

03:18.390 --> 03:19.110
Where is she now?

03:19.150 --> 03:22.300
At the courthouse. She went in early
to get comfortable with the room.

03:22.340 --> 03:23.280
And Jerry?

03:23.280 --> 03:24.540
Purring away.

03:24.540 --> 03:28.610
He'll take the first witness and
give Katie time to find her sea legs,

03:28.650 --> 03:29.790
and then he'll do the csing.

03:29.830 --> 03:32.410
Alan, do—do they
have any chance here?

03:32.410 --> 03:35.870
If they can establish that the
client and the victim were lovers,

03:35.910 --> 03:38.800
it may allow them to point
suspicion at the husband.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.930
Can they establish that?

03:40.930 --> 03:43.140
So far all they have
is the client's word.

03:43.180 --> 03:45.620
Katie is going to see the
victim's therapist today.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.320
Maybe he can confirm it.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.480
I need to get to court.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.720
Alan, wait a sec.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.750
I just have to talk to
you about something first.

03:51.790 --> 03:53.400
–Who's suing you now?
–N-nobody.

03:53.440 --> 03:58.320
It's just, uh, with Denise on extended
maternity and things being busier here,

03:58.360 --> 04:00.700
I've hired another associate.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.120
Great. A woman, I hope.

04:02.160 --> 04:02.760
Yes.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.650
Who likes to be teased and tempted.

04:04.690 --> 04:05.630
Loves it.

04:05.630 --> 04:06.790
Then I can't wait to meet her.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.280
Well, you see, you have met her.

04:11.940 --> 04:14.880
Al-Alan, Lorraine. Lorraine, Alan.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.000
Hello, Alan.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.769
Still looking well.

04:19.899 --> 04:22.140
I—is this
a joke?

04:22.140 --> 04:24.670
Well, it's not a joke.
She's a great attorney.

04:24.710 --> 04:28.540
I—perhaps it's a little
funny, but it's not a joke.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.410
But funny. To whom?

04:30.410 --> 04:35.700
Well, perhaps to me, and maybe Lorraine
sees the humor in it. Do you, Lorraine?

04:42.640 --> 04:44.818
It's an extremely gruesome death.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.450
Strangulation actually
crushes the windpipe.

04:47.490 --> 04:48.876
You know, the larynx.

04:51.210 --> 04:53.850
It forces pressure
into the eye sockets.

04:54.130 --> 04:56.630
Sometimes the eyes have
been known to pop out.

04:56.670 --> 04:58.670
Death can take up to two minutes.

04:58.710 --> 05:02.850
To me, I've always thought it takes a
particular kind of sociopath to kill this way.

05:02.890 --> 05:04.100
Shouldn't we be objecting?

05:04.140 --> 05:05.380
I'd rather not.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.200
I mean, think of it.
You look at your victim.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.430
You're staring into her eyes as
you're squeezing the life out of her.

05:10.470 --> 05:11.860
You watch her profound suffering.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.950
It's the essence of depravity.

05:14.950 --> 05:16.680
Thank you, doctor.

05:38.150 --> 05:39.660
Your testimony smacked of psychology.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.746
Are you a psychologist, doctor?

05:42.770 --> 05:43.750
No.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.080
Are you a behavioral scientist?

05:47.600 --> 05:48.150
No.

05:48.150 --> 05:51.220
I'm curious as to why you didn't
just stick to medical findings then.

05:51.260 --> 05:55.380
Do you have any medical findings
that point to my client as the killer?

05:55.420 --> 05:56.810
His semen was in the woman.

05:56.850 --> 05:58.570
That's evidence of sex, not murder.

05:58.610 --> 05:59.400
Evidence of rape.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.770
Did your findings conclude
a rape had occurred, doctor?

06:01.810 --> 06:02.900
There was vaginal bruising.

06:02.940 --> 06:05.000
Minimal vaginal
bruing, according to your report,

06:05.040 --> 06:09.528
which could be consistent with
consensual intercourse, am I correct?

06:10.040 --> 06:11.190
I suppose.

06:11.190 --> 06:12.640
Nothing further.

06:25.180 --> 06:27.240
What are you doing sitting back there?

06:27.280 --> 06:28.950
I'm monitoring.

06:29.850 --> 06:31.770
Do you have an answer yet?

06:33.140 --> 06:34.520
To what?

06:34.520 --> 06:36.150
Our baby.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.230
Are we having one?

06:40.450 --> 06:46.700
Gloria, I suspect the decision to have a
child falls into the life-changing category.

06:46.700 --> 06:50.690
Do you really mean to rush
me, given the fact that it's…

06:52.130 --> 06:54.090
me?
–Yes.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.542
We've been together long enough.

06:57.140 --> 06:58.920
Are you in or out?

07:01.380 --> 07:04.710
Can you imagine putting
it to me like that?

07:04.710 --> 07:06.970
Well, here's the thing
about women, Alan—

07:07.010 --> 07:10.920
their eggs and their brain cells
dry up all at the same time.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.860
And here's the thing
about that woman:

07:12.900 --> 07:14.500
she's a psycho.
–Gloria?

07:14.500 --> 07:16.330
She's a total nut job.
Trust me on this.

07:16.370 --> 07:19.472
Of course, you happen to
go for total nut jobs.

07:20.730 --> 07:22.140
Excuse me.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.980
Free for dinner?
–I am.

07:25.310 --> 07:26.620
Denny, could you excuse us, please?

07:26.660 --> 07:28.550
I know this wonderful restaurant.

07:28.590 --> 07:31.070
We could leave right now.
We could take the elevator.

07:31.110 --> 07:32.450
Denny, please.

07:32.450 --> 07:34.460
Welcome to the firm.

07:34.460 --> 07:36.280
Denny Crane.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.430
–Enchantée.
–Oh, my.

07:38.430 --> 07:39.600
Me, too.

07:47.610 --> 07:50.750
I'm not stalking you,
if that's your concern.

07:50.750 --> 07:56.420
Why are you here, with that
neck and those eyes and…

07:57.060 --> 07:58.420
all the rest?

07:58.420 --> 08:00.140
I came here to practice law, Alan.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.120
No need to worry about me.

08:02.430 --> 08:04.860
Need we worry about you?

08:15.360 --> 08:17.940
–We can't do this.
–Never.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.510
I really appreciate
you seeing me, doctor.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.380
I'm not sure it'll do you any good.

08:30.420 --> 08:33.549
I understand you treated Mrs
Rivers for about three years.

08:33.590 --> 08:34.490
I did.

08:34.490 --> 08:39.360
And during that time, did she ever mention a
romantic relationship with Joseph Washington?

08:39.400 --> 08:41.850
Ms Lloyd, anything a client
tells me is privileged.

08:41.890 --> 08:43.150
Certainly you must know that.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.710
Of course.

08:45.550 --> 08:49.140
Doctor, I-I have enormous respect for
your desire to maintain confidentiality,

08:49.180 --> 08:53.490
but I have a client I believe is
being falsely accused of murder.

08:53.490 --> 08:57.910
If I cannot establish this affair —and right
now I can't— he may very well be convicted.

08:57.950 --> 09:00.260
I'm a bit desperate.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.170
I'm sorry.

09:12.350 --> 09:18.410
If you were to be subpœnaed and called to the
stand, could I at least count on you to tell the truth?

09:18.450 --> 09:20.220
Well, counselor…

09:21.170 --> 09:24.280
you have no idea what the truth is.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.418
That stuff'll kill you.

09:41.720 --> 09:45.380
There's a great espresso café
across the street. Much better.

09:45.420 --> 09:46.570
Le-let me take you.

09:46.610 --> 09:50.510
We could go down in the
elevator and come back up.

09:50.510 --> 09:52.510
Alan told you about
our little encounter.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.570
Mm, yeah, out of guilt.

09:54.570 --> 09:56.440
He needed the comfort of a friend.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.430
He's in a very serious
relationship. You know this.

10:00.430 --> 10:02.140
Your hand is on my hip.

10:02.140 --> 10:02.970
Incidental contact.

10:03.010 --> 10:06.650
Listen, Alan has trouble with fidelity.

10:06.650 --> 10:08.540
Oh, he can be loyal to his friends.

10:08.580 --> 10:10.960
He would never betray me,
for example.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.570
But women…

10:13.920 --> 10:15.630
I try to help him as best I can.

10:15.670 --> 10:16.960
Oh, he's lucky to have you.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.060
Bottom line is he'd never be
able to resist you for Gloria—

10:22.060 --> 10:24.760
those pouty lips, come-hither breasts.

10:24.760 --> 10:29.920
The only way he'd be able to keep his hands
off you is if you became involved with a…

10:29.960 --> 10:31.760
a close friend.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.730
Say his best friend.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.370
Say me.

10:36.890 --> 10:39.620
You're standing awfully close, Denny.

10:40.780 --> 10:42.740
Sleep with me.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.160
For Alan.

10:48.100 --> 10:51.920
So the victim was in this condition and
position when you arrived on the scene, detective?

10:51.960 --> 10:55.190
Yes. We immediately recognized
it as a strangulation.

10:55.230 --> 10:57.770
Did you have any immediate leads, sir?

10:57.770 --> 11:02.680
The neighbors saw the custodian,
Joseph Washington, entering
the premises around 5:00 PM

11:02.720 --> 11:08.560
Upon searching his locker, we found traces of
blood that ultimately matched that of the victim.

11:08.600 --> 11:13.520
Upon questioning the defendant, he admitted
to raping and murdering Mrs Rivers.

11:13.560 --> 11:18.330
DNA analysis eventually positively
identified the semen as being his.

11:18.770 --> 11:20.430
Thank you, sir.

11:29.700 --> 11:31.100
Are you okay?

11:31.100 --> 11:32.300
Yes.

11:43.290 --> 11:48.250
If I may ask, was the blood found on the
inside or outside of Mr Washington's locker?

11:48.290 --> 11:49.330
The outside.

11:49.330 --> 11:53.040
So if someone had endeavored to make it
look like Joseph Washington had killed her,

11:53.080 --> 11:55.510
they could've spattered
a droplet or two?

11:55.550 --> 11:56.870
He also confessed.

11:56.870 --> 12:00.590
Yes, as I understand it, he protested
his innocence for 36 hours,

12:00.630 --> 12:05.000
all the while being sleep deprived, after
which he voluntarily confessed.

12:05.040 --> 12:08.670
The extent of this confession
was,“okay, I did it. Whatever.”

12:08.710 --> 12:11.790
It was voluntary and genuine.

12:12.220 --> 12:14.850
–Did you consider anybody else?
–No.

12:14.850 --> 12:17.630
He was seen entering her apartment
around the time of the murder,

12:17.670 --> 12:19.860
so our immediate focus was on him.

12:19.900 --> 12:24.650
Once the semen was determined
to be his and the blood on his locker
was determined to be hers,

12:24.690 --> 12:26.970
he became our only suspect.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.230
And he confessed.

12:29.660 --> 12:32.762
So he was the only one
you really investigated?

12:46.980 --> 12:48.930
Where'd you find this Katie?

12:49.180 --> 12:53.020
Not every great young lawyer
comes out of Harvard, Alan.

12:53.370 --> 12:55.010
Where'd she come from?

12:57.220 --> 12:58.570
Harvard.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.450
So are— are we
having a baby?

13:05.720 --> 13:07.460
Denny talks.

13:11.800 --> 13:16.288
Did you ever struggle with the
question of having children, Shirley?

13:18.030 --> 13:22.000
Is it that you don't want kids, Alan,

13:22.000 --> 13:26.420
or the idea of having them with Gloria?

13:32.140 --> 13:36.100
I come from a long line
of dreadful fathers—

13:37.050 --> 13:40.020
my great-grandfather
and my grandfather.

13:41.460 --> 13:43.130
My father.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.820
With each generation,
they get worse.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.570
And me, well…

13:53.550 --> 13:56.256
You don't think you'd
make a good father?

13:57.890 --> 14:02.114
I think a child might get a little
lost with me leading the way.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.180
Jerry?

14:05.180 --> 14:07.420
I'm very sorry to intrude.

14:07.420 --> 14:09.620
Alan, we need to go.

14:09.930 --> 14:11.360
Right.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.420
Shirley.

14:26.610 --> 14:29.010
I entered our apartment
just before 6:00.

14:29.050 --> 14:31.790
I called out to Ann, but
there was no response,

14:31.830 --> 14:35.270
which was odd because we had
planned to have an early dinner.

14:35.310 --> 14:39.010
I went into the living
room, and there she was.

14:39.010 --> 14:41.960
Her eyes were bulging and open.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.860
She was dead.

14:44.430 --> 14:47.120
Sir, did you have any thoughts about
who could've possibly done this?

14:47.160 --> 14:48.860
I knew who did it.

14:48.860 --> 14:50.630
Joseph Washington.

14:50.630 --> 14:51.750
And why, doctor?

14:51.750 --> 14:57.720
My wife had recently complained
to me that he had been paying her
an unusual and untoward interest.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.620
She felt he was becoming obsessed.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.060
And she was becoming frightened of him.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.250
Why would he lie like that?

15:03.290 --> 15:07.090
I specifically asked him before,“do
you have any reason to suspect Joseph?”

15:07.130 --> 15:08.970
And he said,“no.” You heard him, Jerry.

15:09.010 --> 15:11.050
I did. Liar! Liar!

15:11.050 --> 15:13.570
–Okay, both of you need to take a breath.
–Liar!

15:13.610 --> 15:15.660
Jerry, stay.

15:18.170 --> 15:20.420
Witnesses lie. This one did.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.360
Either because he is the real killer,

15:22.400 --> 15:25.420
or the prosecution simply told
him that they wobble on motive,

15:25.460 --> 15:27.230
and he decided to bolster their case.

15:27.270 --> 15:30.740
Husbands have been known to be
biased against their wives' killers.

15:30.780 --> 15:33.110
I didn't kill her.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.560
So what do I do?

15:36.070 --> 15:39.450
Well, you can call Jerry to
establish a lie, but in doing so,

15:39.490 --> 15:42.010
he becomes a witness and would
be disqualified as a lawyer.

15:42.050 --> 15:46.280
I would simply accuse the doctor
of lying, try to make him squirm.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.930
I would also ask him if he knew that his
wife was having an affair with Joseph.

15:49.970 --> 15:53.020
It's assuming a fact not
in evidence, but so what?

15:53.060 --> 15:55.440
The question itself will score.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.410
Then cross him on time line.

15:57.410 --> 15:58.710
Should I accuse him of being the killer?

15:58.750 --> 16:00.420
That I wouldn't do. You can't prove it,

16:00.460 --> 16:05.740
and we can't have you coming off
as the bad guy since Joseph already
seems to have that well in hand.

16:05.780 --> 16:08.830
–It doesn't sound like much.
–You haven't got much.

16:08.870 --> 16:11.700
All you can play for
here is reasonable doubt.

16:11.740 --> 16:15.320
And you have got to stay calm.

16:22.380 --> 16:26.290
When I spoke to you, doctor, you said
nothing about your wife feeling frightened.

16:26.330 --> 16:29.880
In fact, you stated that she had
made no complaints about my client.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.890
I had made a decision not
to cooperate with someone

16:31.930 --> 16:37.408
who was trying to secure the freedom of
the man who had raped and murdered my wife.

16:37.660 --> 16:42.940
Doctor, did you know that your wife and
Joseph Washington were having an affair?

16:42.950 --> 16:44.710
I had no such knowledge.

16:44.710 --> 16:48.080
You said that you went into
your apartment just before 6:00.

16:48.120 --> 16:48.870
Yes.

16:48.870 --> 16:52.990
Video surveillance in the parking garage
shows you entering the facility at 5:20.

16:53.030 --> 16:55.070
What were you doing
for 40 minutes, doctor?

16:55.110 --> 16:58.740
Finishing up a phone call with a
colleague on an oncology consult.

16:58.780 --> 17:03.230
I spent the duration dictating
my notes and conclusions.

17:08.440 --> 17:11.550
Doctor, did you kill your wife
and attempt to frame my client?

17:11.589 --> 17:13.849
–Your honor—
–Overruled.

17:14.650 --> 17:16.550
I did not kill my wife.

17:16.550 --> 17:17.890
The question didn'teem to offend you.

17:17.930 --> 17:22.099
The question doesn't shock me
because you tipped your hand
when you came to my office.

17:22.140 --> 17:26.890
You revealed who and
what you are then, counsel.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.438
I have nothing further.

17:40.180 --> 17:41.780
No redirect, your honor.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.990
You may step down, doctor.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.330
Mr Chase?

17:49.330 --> 17:51.574
The prosecution rests, your honor.

17:57.200 --> 17:57.870
I'm so sorry.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.510
I just—I felt the cross
was so utterly anæmic.

18:00.550 --> 18:04.210
And I remembered your advice about how
a question alone could be effective,

18:04.250 --> 18:06.570
and I-I just suddenly got
the idea to accuse him.

18:06.610 --> 18:10.966
You didn't remember the advice
about not looking like the bad guy?

18:13.840 --> 18:15.200
Okay.

18:19.690 --> 18:21.480
Joseph…

18:22.630 --> 18:23.940
look at me.

18:26.060 --> 18:28.180
My guess is second degree
is still on the table.

18:28.220 --> 18:30.350
–Now would be the time for—
–No.

18:32.140 --> 18:33.610
I could take the stand.

18:33.650 --> 18:35.890
In which case, all your prior
felonies will be introduced.

18:35.930 --> 18:37.670
Well, I'm not gonna plead.

18:37.670 --> 18:40.760
I didn't kill her. I won't say I did.

18:40.760 --> 18:44.060
I'd rather spend the rest
of my life in jail than…

18:45.070 --> 18:46.950
I won't say it.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.450
What about the victim's therapist?

18:50.490 --> 18:52.770
I subpœnaed him. I have
no idea what he'd say.

18:52.810 --> 18:53.860
Do you have an instinct?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.030
I think he'd tell the truth.

18:55.070 --> 18:57.710
–The truth being they were lovers.
–Yes.

19:02.640 --> 19:07.920
You never, ever call a witness if you
don't know what he or she is going to say.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.260
But?

19:11.080 --> 19:14.314
But I don't think you
have any other choice here.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.880
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

19:23.920 --> 19:26.060
–I do.
–Be seated.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.640
Good afternoon, Dr Wood.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.670
It should be pointed out that you
are here today courtesy of a subpœna.

19:36.710 --> 19:38.770
Is that correct?
–It is.

19:38.770 --> 19:42.994
In the course of your practice, did
you treat Ann Harris Rivers?

19:43.510 --> 19:44.570
I did.

19:44.950 --> 19:48.720
Without revealing content,
did she discuss her marriage?

19:48.720 --> 19:49.900
She did.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.890
Uh, perhaps you want to stop there.

19:51.930 --> 19:54.330
I could. But you struck me
as a very principled man.

19:54.370 --> 19:57.250
And the idea of an innocent
man going to prison—
–Objection.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.150
Sustained.

19:58.150 --> 20:02.374
Doctor, did Mrs Rivers ever
discuss my client Joseph Washington?

20:03.560 --> 20:05.010
She did.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.520
And what did she say?

20:09.560 --> 20:12.200
Your honor, she's asking the
witness to break privilege.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.140
The patient is dead.
Privilege can be waived.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.930
I'll allow the question.

20:15.930 --> 20:20.616
Doctor, what did Mrs Rivers tell you
about my client Joseph Washington?

20:22.580 --> 20:25.040
Please answer the question, doctor.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.890
She said that she and Mr
Washington were lovers.

20:39.100 --> 20:41.190
I have no further questions.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.870
I didn't proposition her. I
merely asked her to sleep with me.

20:48.910 --> 20:51.930
Denny, how would you feel if I
asked Shirley to sleep with me?

20:51.970 --> 20:54.680
Well, uh, Shirley is the
great love of my life.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.630
Lorraine is somebody
you rode in an elevator.

20:56.670 --> 20:59.170
Oh, no, no, no. She's much, much—

21:00.080 --> 21:02.160
I don't want you coming on to her.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.620
Oh, great.

21:05.990 --> 21:07.470
How's Gloria?

21:07.470 --> 21:09.380
–I'm not talking about Gloria.
–I am.

21:09.420 --> 21:11.760
When are you gonna tell her
you really love Lorraine?

21:11.800 --> 21:14.100
Lorraine was an affair.

21:14.760 --> 21:18.430
There's a big difference between
that and a committed relationship.

21:18.470 --> 21:20.380
Yes. Affairs usually last longer.

21:20.420 --> 21:22.290
–Oh, and now who's the cynic?
–I am.

21:22.330 --> 21:23.790
You're the romantic.
You love Lorraine.

21:23.830 --> 21:26.520
I do not love—
excuse me.

21:27.050 --> 21:29.294
You—you said you
wanted to see me.

21:30.070 --> 21:31.470
Yes.

21:31.470 --> 21:33.360
Denny was just leaving.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.050
–No, I wasn't.
–Yes, you were.

21:37.970 --> 21:40.250
Big kahuna. Name on the door.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.290
Katie…

21:55.300 --> 21:59.320
on the heels of the therapist's testimony,

21:59.330 --> 22:02.630
I think you may have enough
for reasonable doubt.

22:02.640 --> 22:03.600
Really?

22:03.610 --> 22:04.660
You may.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.590
The question obviously is…

22:08.200 --> 22:10.070
whether to call Joseph to the stand.

22:10.110 --> 22:12.390
He's the only one who
can explain the confession.

22:12.430 --> 22:16.300
True, but once he gets in that chair,
the floodgates open on his priors,

22:16.340 --> 22:18.810
which is why my gut says don't call him.

22:18.850 --> 22:20.480
My gut says otherwise.

22:22.230 --> 22:23.340
I beg your pardon.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.390
Katie, he doesn't have the most…

22:25.430 --> 22:26.820
pleasant demeanor.

22:31.760 --> 22:36.050
When I first laid eyes
on him, I saw a beast.

22:36.630 --> 22:39.270
That may very well be
what the jury saw…

22:39.880 --> 22:42.180
and—and perhaps still sees.

22:43.310 --> 22:45.230
But when I listened to him,

22:45.500 --> 22:47.240
when I talked to him,

22:48.980 --> 22:51.210
I got a glimpse of his humanity…

22:51.750 --> 22:55.710
and, believe it or not, his gentility.

22:56.870 --> 22:59.690
I'd like to afford the jury that glimpse.

23:00.500 --> 23:06.070
I'd like them to see how deeply,
deeply human this man is.

23:07.350 --> 23:10.584
You really think you've got
an innocent man here.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.030
I know I do.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.340
Then call him to the stand.

23:21.590 --> 23:23.310
The affair had to be very secret.

23:23.350 --> 23:25.726
She didn't want anybody to find out.

23:25.870 --> 23:27.550
We always met at her apartment.

23:27.590 --> 23:29.070
On the evening of her death,
you were there.

23:29.110 --> 23:32.200
I arrived just before 5:00
and left a little before 6:00.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.840
And what happened whilst you were there?

23:34.880 --> 23:36.210
We were intimate.

23:36.220 --> 23:37.160
You made love.

23:37.170 --> 23:38.050
Yes.

23:38.060 --> 23:42.310
Mr Washington, after her death, the police
arrested you, and you confessed to this crime.

23:42.350 --> 23:43.670
Can you tell us why?

23:43.780 --> 23:48.600
The police kicked in my door,
told me I did it, put me in a room,

23:48.610 --> 23:51.710
and then after keeping me
awake for two days,

23:51.720 --> 23:53.790
making me drink coffee,
not letting me sleep—

23:53.830 --> 23:55.840
Did you tell them that you
and the victim were lovers?

23:55.880 --> 23:57.710
They didn't want to hear none of that.

23:57.750 --> 24:02.370
They kept saying that they were not gonna
let me out of that room until I said I did it.

24:02.410 --> 24:04.090
Finally, I…

24:05.270 --> 24:06.770
I just gave up.

24:07.480 --> 24:11.220
You know, they had their minds
all made up, and I just wanted them
to leave me alone.

24:11.260 --> 24:13.030
So I said, “whatever.”

24:13.040 --> 24:16.260
Then they gave me a lawyer, and
he didn't want to hear the truth either.

24:16.300 --> 24:19.210
He just wanted me to plead guilty
so he could be done with it.

24:19.250 --> 24:22.880
Same with the lawyer after him
and the lawyer after him.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.440
So you confessed to something
you did not do.

24:25.480 --> 24:28.050
I confessed to something I did not do.

24:30.050 --> 24:33.350
Mr Washington, you were
convicted of rape in 1985?

24:33.550 --> 24:34.640
Date rape.

24:34.650 --> 24:35.490
And I was innocent.

24:35.530 --> 24:37.708
I— you were convicted? Yes or no?

24:38.260 --> 24:39.810
I'd like to explain.

24:39.820 --> 24:40.970
Go ahead.

24:41.660 --> 24:43.050
She was 16.

24:43.060 --> 24:44.620
I was 17.

24:44.630 --> 24:47.430
She was my girlfriend,
and she was white.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.180
Her father…

24:49.740 --> 24:51.670
walked in on us…

24:52.010 --> 24:53.730
while we…

24:54.370 --> 24:55.680
she…

24:55.690 --> 24:58.480
she claimed that I raped her,
but I did not.

24:58.520 --> 25:01.600
So you were convicted of rape in 1985.

25:01.610 --> 25:04.400
You were convicted
of armed robbery in 1989?

25:04.440 --> 25:05.760
I was a drug addict back then.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.450
You were convicted
of armed robbery, yes or no?

25:08.490 --> 25:09.200
Yes.

25:09.210 --> 25:12.120
You were convicted of
aggravated assault in 1991.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.750
I was attacked in prison.

25:13.790 --> 25:14.920
I fought back.

25:14.930 --> 25:18.200
So you were not at fault
in any of these arrests?

25:19.820 --> 25:22.650
How did Mrs Rivers' blood
get on your locker?

25:22.690 --> 25:24.230
Someone put it there.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.180
I-I was framed.

25:25.220 --> 25:27.120
Really? There were only
microscopic traces.

25:27.160 --> 25:28.750
If someone had wanted to frame you,

25:28.790 --> 25:30.410
shouldn't it be visible to the naked eye?

25:30.450 --> 25:32.100
Whoever did it was smart.

25:32.360 --> 25:33.510
Got it.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.650
So…

25:34.660 --> 25:37.670
in review— didn't do this one,
you were framed.

25:37.710 --> 25:38.800
You didn't commit the rape.

25:38.840 --> 25:39.840
The victim made it up.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.690
As for the robbery, you were on drugs.

25:41.730 --> 25:43.230
Aggravated assault— self-defense.

25:43.270 --> 25:44.300
I loved Ann Rivers.

25:44.340 --> 25:45.280
Move to strike.

25:45.320 --> 25:46.310
Oh, you don't want to hear that.

25:46.350 --> 25:47.050
–Your honor—
–Mr Washington, there's no—

25:47.090 --> 25:48.930
the police didn't want to hear that.

25:48.970 --> 25:51.380
All anybody wants to hear
is that I killed her.

25:51.420 --> 25:53.030
Well, I did not kill her.

25:53.070 --> 25:55.250
And I don't care if everybody's
mind is made up.

25:55.290 --> 25:57.070
I did not take this woman's life!

25:57.110 --> 25:58.700
Joseph.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.840
I am innocent of this crime.

26:32.060 --> 26:33.310
Lorraine.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.400
Getting settled okay?

26:34.440 --> 26:35.910
I am. Thank you.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.560
Finding everything okay?

26:38.090 --> 26:39.910
Finding Denny okay?

26:39.920 --> 26:41.980
Denny seems to keep finding me.

26:42.610 --> 26:43.910
I'll speak to him.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.170
Sure.

26:57.060 --> 26:58.700
Anything else?

27:18.830 --> 27:20.170
Jerry.

27:22.070 --> 27:23.810
it's almost midnight.

27:25.540 --> 27:27.440
I'm visualizing my closing.

27:32.910 --> 27:34.400
You ready?

27:36.260 --> 27:39.640
I'm thinking of using
the wooden cigarette.

27:40.350 --> 27:42.270
I'm not sure without it.

27:42.280 --> 27:45.382
Well, you're very good
with the cigarette prop.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.940
But I think you're at your…

27:51.950 --> 27:54.390
best when you…

27:54.400 --> 27:56.290
speak as yourself.

28:01.550 --> 28:04.454
You need to be at your
best tomorrow, Jerry.

28:04.680 --> 28:07.848
You're not going to win this
with razzle-dazzle.

28:09.470 --> 28:12.330
Speak to them from your heart.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.280
Do you believe in your client?

28:20.950 --> 28:22.040
I do.

28:22.050 --> 28:23.160
I really do.

28:23.170 --> 28:27.780
Well, then tomorrow, you simply
need to believe in yourself.

28:43.220 --> 28:45.220
You were wrong with Shirley.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.220
I'm sorry?

28:48.580 --> 28:51.352
I think you would make
a wonderful father.

28:51.480 --> 28:54.648
I can't imagine a better parent
to lead the way.

29:00.010 --> 29:02.000
Thank you, Jerry.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.890
I guess if we were to accept
Mr Washington at his word,

29:24.990 --> 29:27.630
he would be the most
unlucky guy I know.

29:28.500 --> 29:33.300
Dating a girl in high school, she
accuses him of rape so she wouldn't
get in trouble with her dad.

29:33.340 --> 29:34.900
That's unlucky.

29:35.160 --> 29:38.660
Becomes a drug addict, can't feed
his habit unless he robs someone.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.190
Bad break there.

29:40.200 --> 29:43.670
In prison, he's forced
to split a man's head open.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.730
Another unfortunate bounce.

29:47.070 --> 29:50.440
Then the woman committing adultery
with him just happens to turn up dead,

29:50.480 --> 29:57.570
and she gets killed around the same time
that he's in her apartment having either
consensual or nonconsensual sex with her.

29:57.610 --> 30:00.910
Could he be any more cursed?

30:01.270 --> 30:02.830
Well, actually…

30:03.330 --> 30:04.780
I guess so.

30:05.230 --> 30:08.780
Traces of her blood
were found on his locker.

30:08.790 --> 30:10.480
Now what are the odds of that?

30:10.520 --> 30:12.880
Now with all this bad luck
working against him,

30:12.920 --> 30:18.700
this sure would be the wrong time
to confess to something
he didn't really do, wouldn't it?

30:18.740 --> 30:21.000
Now how pathetic…

30:21.320 --> 30:26.360
how desperate that they stoop
to accusing the victim's grieving widower?

30:26.370 --> 30:29.250
But I guess that falls in line with
the rest of their logic, doesn't it?

30:29.290 --> 30:34.050
I mean, it's not the man with
the violent, criminal past who
was last seen with her, no.

30:34.090 --> 30:40.000
It was the man with no criminal record,
the one with no motive, the one
who cures cancer for a living.

30:40.040 --> 30:43.604
We just arrested Joseph Washington
because we're evil.

30:45.130 --> 30:48.892
Now you need to go into that room
and decide who is evil.

30:49.470 --> 30:54.090
Mr Washington isn't here today
because he's a little down on his luck.

30:54.420 --> 30:55.450
He…

30:55.460 --> 30:56.670
committed…

30:56.680 --> 30:58.240
murder.

31:01.130 --> 31:04.710
The fact is, while the police and the
prosecution were maintaining rape,

31:04.750 --> 31:10.954
while they summarily dismissed
the notion of my client and the
victim being lovers, they were…

31:11.580 --> 31:15.230
Ms Rivers' therapist confirmed what
Joseph Washington had been saying all along,

31:15.270 --> 31:18.372
what the police refused
to so much as consider.

31:19.720 --> 31:24.934
The fact is, my client was not the only
person there at the time of the murder.

31:25.590 --> 31:27.430
Dr Rivers was there.

31:28.240 --> 31:32.140
The fact is, he entered the building
40 minutes prior to my client leaving.

31:32.180 --> 31:34.360
He says he remained in
his car dictating some notes.

31:34.400 --> 31:40.300
Perhaps he was biding his time,
waiting for the man he knew to be
having an affair with his wife to leave.

31:40.340 --> 31:42.760
Mr Chase maintains
Dr Rivers had no motive.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.890
That simply is not true.

31:44.900 --> 31:49.830
If he knew his wife was being
unfaithful, that's motive.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.550
The fact is, Dr Rivers
never told the police

31:52.590 --> 31:54.640
he'd been waiting inside
the building for almost 40 minutes.

31:54.680 --> 31:55.750
He never told anybody.

31:55.790 --> 31:58.420
We discovered that,
by looking at security tapes.

31:58.460 --> 32:00.190
The fact is, he lied.

32:00.760 --> 32:04.120
He admitted lying to us when we
questioned him about Joseph Washington.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.920
The fact is, the prosecution
cannot rule him out as the killer.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.100
The fact is, as Detective Berenson testified,

32:10.140 --> 32:17.202
they never investigated anybody other
than my client because they simply
presumed Joseph Washington guilty.

32:17.640 --> 32:19.240
The police, the prosecution,

32:19.280 --> 32:24.170
they're human, and they make mistakes.

32:25.170 --> 32:27.490
They made one here.

32:29.470 --> 32:36.920
Now in order to gain a conviction,
the prosecution must prove guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt.

32:36.930 --> 32:39.660
That's a very high standard,
one we hold dear,

32:39.700 --> 32:45.178
one we set because we know
once we start allowing people
to be convicted with less,

32:45.540 --> 32:49.302
it doesn't simply make prison
more likely for the guilty,

32:49.740 --> 32:51.870
but the innocent as well.

32:52.680 --> 32:57.780
And the idea of an innocent man
losing his life for something he did not do…

32:58.570 --> 33:01.680
We have such an innocent man here today.

33:02.300 --> 33:06.470
Many of us went to law school
for this very privilege,

33:06.480 --> 33:10.590
to at least once stand up
in court for the innocent man.

33:14.490 --> 33:19.242
It is my heartfelt privilege to be
representing Joseph Washington today.

33:20.590 --> 33:24.270
And even if you should be so inclined
as to simply presume his guilt,

33:24.310 --> 33:29.960
as does the prosecution, you must
admit reasonable doubt exists.

33:31.050 --> 33:34.610
Another man was there at the time,
a man who had motive,

33:34.650 --> 33:37.530
a man who wasn't totally
forthcoming with the police,

33:37.570 --> 33:39.890
a man who admittedly lied to us,

33:39.900 --> 33:43.662
a man who waited in his car
until Joseph Washington left.

33:45.340 --> 33:51.470
You simply cannot deny
reasonable doubt exists.

34:24.159 --> 34:26.239
Some closing from your friend.

34:26.690 --> 34:27.960
Yes.

34:41.710 --> 34:44.217
I can't have a child
with you, Gloria.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.290
Okay.

34:59.690 --> 35:03.188
Every woman I have ever loved,
I have stopped loving.

35:05.560 --> 35:09.256
But with a child, I think
I'd probably endeavor to stay.

35:09.280 --> 35:12.270
And with each ensuing day,
I would become…

35:13.570 --> 35:15.380
less and less…

35:17.340 --> 35:19.070
myself.

35:27.650 --> 35:29.210
Good-bye, Alan.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.230
Good-bye.

36:00.730 --> 36:02.820
So how long does it usually take?

36:02.860 --> 36:04.360
It can vary.

36:06.350 --> 36:08.220
Whatever happens…

36:09.090 --> 36:11.560
I want to thank you, the both of you.

36:12.200 --> 36:18.790
Not long ago, I had given up on the idea
of anybody believing me, believing in me.

36:26.490 --> 36:27.890
They've reached a verdict.

36:27.930 --> 36:30.030
–What?
–It's been 30 minutes.

36:32.100 --> 36:33.450
Let's go.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.570
Let me warn everybody
in this room.

36:41.610 --> 36:46.032
I will tolerate no disruption
following the reading of the verdict.

36:46.790 --> 36:48.600
This verdict is unanimous?

36:50.280 --> 36:51.560
It is.

36:51.570 --> 36:53.616
The defendant will please rise.

36:54.010 --> 36:56.560
I shall remind everybody
there are two counts.

36:56.600 --> 36:59.820
Until the foreman renders
the verdict on both counts,

36:59.860 --> 37:02.450
let neither side celebrate prematurely.

37:04.980 --> 37:06.760
Mr Foreman, what say you?

37:06.770 --> 37:08.990
In the matter of the commonwealth
of Massachusetts vs

37:09.030 --> 37:12.230
Joseph Washington on the charge
of murder in the first degree,

37:12.270 --> 37:14.316
we the jury find the defendant…

37:16.020 --> 37:17.110
not guilty.

37:17.550 --> 37:18.880
In the matter of the commonwealth vs

37:18.920 --> 37:24.520
Joseph Washington on the charge
of murder in the second degree,
we find the defendant…

37:24.560 --> 37:26.160
not guilty.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.870
Members of the jury,
this concludes your service.

37:33.910 --> 37:35.758
The defendant is free to go.

37:36.730 --> 37:38.270
We're adjourned.

37:39.750 --> 37:40.980
Congratulations, Katie.

37:41.020 --> 37:42.250
Thank you.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.730
Well done, Jerry.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.710
Joseph, did you hear the last part?

37:54.750 --> 37:56.020
You're free to go.

37:56.410 --> 37:57.300
It's over?

37:57.310 --> 37:59.950
Just in time, 'cause I'm about to vomit.

38:00.550 --> 38:01.820
Thank you.

38:03.730 --> 38:05.340
Thank you so much.

38:08.370 --> 38:10.540
Give us a moment.
What is it with you leeches?

38:10.580 --> 38:11.790
Did you crowd Scooter like this?

38:11.830 --> 38:12.970
I'm sorry.

38:13.410 --> 38:15.730
But I'd appreciate it if you didn't
leave the jurisdiction, okay?

38:15.770 --> 38:19.004
–For God's sake.
–Haven't we been through enough?

38:20.560 --> 38:22.020
Is that a problem?

38:22.960 --> 38:24.360
No.

38:46.790 --> 38:48.460
I can't believe they won.

38:49.810 --> 38:51.230
Denny, you should've seen Jerry.

38:51.270 --> 38:52.760
He was brilliant.

38:52.770 --> 38:54.280
So was the new girl.

38:57.410 --> 38:59.720
You and Gloria leave it as friends?

39:01.730 --> 39:03.190
No.

39:05.290 --> 39:10.690
It's sad, how you go from intimacy
to nothing, cold turkey.

39:10.700 --> 39:15.140
I mean, how many people along
the way have true meaning in your life?

39:15.180 --> 39:19.240
And to suddenly have
no contact after.

39:22.740 --> 39:24.250
it's sad.

39:27.460 --> 39:28.990
Alan…

39:29.000 --> 39:32.860
maybe Lorraine is here for a reason.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.190
I'm not going there.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.280
Not a chance.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.402
I was thinking I was the reason.

39:40.540 --> 39:42.670
I don't like this “dibs” thing.

39:43.410 --> 39:45.230
There's gotta be a statute
of limitations on—

39:45.270 --> 39:46.820
There isn't.

39:47.550 --> 39:48.690
You have my word.

39:48.700 --> 39:51.660
I'll never frolic with Bev or Bethany.

39:51.670 --> 39:52.980
Or Shirley.

39:53.550 --> 39:55.270
Shirley's involved.

39:57.540 --> 39:59.322
What are you talking about?

40:00.070 --> 40:04.294
Don't you ever wonder what Carl
Sack's reason for being here is?

40:07.660 --> 40:09.210
Shirley…

40:09.220 --> 40:10.990
and Carl Sack?

40:11.000 --> 40:12.570
I'd put money on it.

40:13.610 --> 40:15.260
I'd shoot him.

40:16.390 --> 40:17.830
You really think?

40:17.840 --> 40:19.220
I do.

40:21.810 --> 40:23.922
I don't think I can handle that.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.890
I… still love her.

40:31.390 --> 40:33.710
And in my heart, I-I-I…

40:33.720 --> 40:36.560
I still believe she's the one.

40:38.240 --> 40:42.080
After five or six wives
—whatever the…

40:42.510 --> 40:46.660
count— you still believe in “the one”?

40:49.220 --> 40:52.058
That's the only belief
that really matters.

40:56.100 --> 40:58.180
Shirley…

40:59.170 --> 41:01.310
and Carl Sack.

41:03.160 --> 41:06.520
Maybe she's using
Carl Sack to get over me.

41:07.340 --> 41:09.250
Must be that.

41:13.810 --> 41:17.200
Love is an ugly business,
my friend, ugly business.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.120
and yet we live for it.

41:22.960 --> 41:27.184
Well, as you say, maybe it's the
only thing that really matters.

41:29.460 --> 41:31.670
Ugly business.
