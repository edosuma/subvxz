WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:05.021
(sighs)

00:05.070 --> 00:10.030
(rattles door)

00:10.070 --> 00:12.800
Watson, since when
do we lock this door?

00:12.840 --> 00:14.637
(keys jangling)

00:14.680 --> 00:18.070
So the bloodstains proved too
stubborn for the dry cleaner.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.279
Gonna have to try
measures more extreme.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.749
Hey. I didn't think
I'd catch you here.

00:25.790 --> 00:28.088
Joan said you were at a meeting.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.348
Ijust...

00:29.390 --> 00:31.221
returned a book
she loaned me.

00:31.260 --> 00:33.490
She needed your help
carrying it upstairs, did she?

00:33.530 --> 00:35.657
Well, she was moving
some furniture around.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.724
Needed a hand.

00:38.530 --> 00:40.498
Anyway... I gotta run.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.236
That's a nice space suit.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.737
Do I sit on
the bride's side

00:47.780 --> 00:49.202
or the groom's?
(sighs)

00:49.250 --> 00:50.672
Excuse me?

00:50.710 --> 00:52.246
Your upcoming nuptials
with Detective Bell.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.339
I assume the workout
which sent you to the shower

00:54.380 --> 00:56.382
foretells that happy day.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.547
What are you talking about?

00:58.590 --> 01:00.114
I'm well aware you have
an enlightened attitude

01:00.160 --> 01:01.787
when it comes
to the hedonic arts,

01:01.820 --> 01:03.788
but Marcus is a cautious,
conservative man

01:03.830 --> 01:05.320
when it comes to
affairs of the heart.

01:05.360 --> 01:06.691
If he's embarked upon
a physical relationship

01:06.730 --> 01:08.254
with a coworker,
it must be that serious.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.097
Marcus was here,
I took a shower,

01:10.130 --> 01:12.189
so obviously,
we are secret lovers.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.662
There's a timeworn
piece of Wisdom

01:13.700 --> 01:15.361
about dipping your pen
in the company ink.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.630
Obviously, in this case,
the pen is Detective Bell's,

01:17.670 --> 01:18.705
but you get my meaning.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.438
So it's as he said--

01:23.480 --> 01:25.505
he only came here
to borrow your tennis racket?

01:25.550 --> 01:27.108
Yeah, but I
couldn't find it.

01:27.150 --> 01:28.617
Case closed.

01:30.490 --> 01:33.459
Unfortunately, a more pressing
mystery demands my attention.

01:33.490 --> 01:34.787
The captain requires
our presence

01:34.820 --> 01:36.287
at a homicide in Queens.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.729
If you're not too spent,
that is.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.288
GREGSON: Victim's name
is Ellen Jacobs.

01:41.330 --> 01:43.366
She picked up takeout
from Half Moon Wok,

01:43.400 --> 01:45.789
Chinese restaurant
behind us, at 8:00 pm.

01:45.830 --> 01:47.468
At 10:00 p.m., the delivery guy

01:47.500 --> 01:49.832
noticed that the car was idling.

01:49.870 --> 01:51.235
He came over

01:51.270 --> 01:52.532
and discovered this.

01:52.580 --> 01:53.729
CSU should take extra care

01:53.780 --> 01:55.179
dusting for prints in the back.

01:55.210 --> 01:57.872
The attack occurred
after she was belted in,

01:57.910 --> 02:00.470
so I think it's safe to assume
the killer broke in,

02:00.520 --> 02:03.444
lay in wait behind her.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.718
Wasn't a robbery.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.286
She's still wearing her jewelry.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.379
Purse hasn't been touched.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.422
I don't see a phone here,
though.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.752
That's because
she was holding it

02:14.800 --> 02:16.825
when the killer struck.

02:19.870 --> 02:21.861
This place is dark
but pretty exposed.

02:21.900 --> 02:23.629
Did canvassing turn up
any witnesses?

02:23.670 --> 02:27.276
The restaurant says most of
their business is delivery,

02:27.310 --> 02:29.778
so not a lot of people
coming and going.

02:29.810 --> 02:31.801
The parking lot doesn't have
any security cameras,

02:31.850 --> 02:34.910
so, all things considered,
not a bad spot to...

02:34.950 --> 02:36.588
get away with murder.

02:36.620 --> 02:38.781
Wouldn't give up hope
of any witnesses just yet.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.917
The smudges on the screen
gave away the most

02:41.960 --> 02:43.359
commonly used digits,
and it's a short leap

02:43.390 --> 02:44.584
to her PIN number.

02:44.630 --> 02:45.756
Her last call
was to "home"

02:45.790 --> 02:47.326
and lasted precisely
three minutes.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.952
Three minutes, coincidentally,
this is exactly

02:49.000 --> 02:50.797
how long an answering machine
will record before hanging up.

02:50.830 --> 02:51.967
Hi. You've reached the Jacobs.
We're not here right now.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.467
Leave a message
and we'll call you back.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.263
If Ms. Jacobs is remotely
normal, she'll have used

02:55.300 --> 02:58.269
the same PIN number
for other purposes in her life.

02:58.310 --> 02:59.971
MALE VOICE:
You have one new message.

03:00.010 --> 03:01.432
Press "1" to...

03:01.480 --> 03:03.402
First new message.
(beep)

03:03.450 --> 03:05.543
WOMAN:
Hey, hon. Tried your cell.
I guess you're out.

03:05.580 --> 03:07.878
Hope you're in the mood
for Half Moon Wok,

03:07.920 --> 03:09.342
'cause I just bought a ton.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.846
(engine starts)
If you beat me home,

03:10.890 --> 03:11.879
maybe open a bottle...

03:11.920 --> 03:13.717
Oh, my God. No.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.954
Stop it!

03:14.990 --> 03:16.218
No! No!

03:16.260 --> 03:17.625
(screams)

03:17.660 --> 03:18.979
(screaming, sobbing)

03:19.030 --> 03:20.850
Lack of witnesses
won't be a problem.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.867
They're us.

03:24.970 --> 03:28.565
*

03:57.730 --> 03:59.698
ELLEN: If you beat me home,
maybe open a bottle...

03:59.740 --> 04:00.764
Oh, my God. No.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.267
Stop it!

04:02.310 --> 04:03.538
No! No!

04:03.570 --> 04:05.003
(screaming)

04:05.040 --> 04:05.859
Whoa, you moved.

04:05.910 --> 04:08.276
When I went to bed,
you were all the way

04:08.310 --> 04:09.868
on the other side
of the table.

04:12.050 --> 04:13.779
Bet that recording
hasn't changed

04:13.820 --> 04:14.969
any more than
your clothes have.

04:15.020 --> 04:16.419
It hasn't.

04:16.450 --> 04:17.678
But my perception of it has.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.381
Listen.

04:19.420 --> 04:20.751
Oh, my God. No.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.951
Stop it! No! No!

04:22.990 --> 04:23.957
(screams)

04:23.990 --> 04:25.059
Do you hear it?

04:25.090 --> 04:26.557
I heard the same thing

04:26.600 --> 04:28.420
I heard
the first hundred times:

04:28.460 --> 04:29.996
a woman who was terrified

04:30.030 --> 04:31.793
because her killer popped up
from behind her.

04:31.830 --> 04:34.867
Accurate, obviously,
but incomplete.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.765
Pay particular attention
to Ellen's inflection

04:36.810 --> 04:39.005
as she transitions
from "God" to "no."

04:39.040 --> 04:41.076
Oh, my God. No.

04:41.110 --> 04:42.805
Stop it! No!

04:42.850 --> 04:44.044
Oh, my God. No.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.968
Wait, there's a little
change there.

04:46.010 --> 04:48.046
Sounded like she was a little
less afraid for a second.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.479
Almost like
she recognized the guy.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.408
I believe, for a brief moment,

04:51.450 --> 04:53.054
perhaps before the killer
made his move,

04:53.090 --> 04:55.081
Ellen Jacobs relaxed,

04:55.120 --> 04:57.588
as if she felt whoever was
behind her wasn't a threat.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.825
Okay. So you want to start
with her work or home?

04:59.860 --> 05:01.088
Neither.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.495
And there's no time for coffee.

05:02.530 --> 05:04.896
Hawes is expecting us
at the morgue.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.065
(sighs)

05:08.100 --> 05:10.034
HAWES: Cause of death
was no surprise.

05:10.070 --> 05:11.332
Suffocation.

05:11.370 --> 05:13.577
But the autopsy was... eventful.

05:13.610 --> 05:15.874
I thought you two should
take a look at the report

05:15.910 --> 05:17.741
and the mass spectrometer
results.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.344
Traces of sodium
thiosulfate

05:23.390 --> 05:25.881
in her lungs.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.717
It's_ a common
chemical compound

05:27.760 --> 05:29.489
used for gold mining,
leather tanning

05:29.530 --> 05:30.986
and water desalination.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.554
It's harmless enough
to gargle with.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.726
Only that's not
what happened here.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.920
There was more of the stuff

05:34.960 --> 05:36.723
in the plastic bag
that smothered her.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.397
She probably sucked it in when
she drew in her last breath.

05:38.430 --> 05:39.658
Anyway, that's not
the main reason

05:39.700 --> 05:40.894
why I thought we should talk.

05:40.940 --> 05:41.964
Ellen was eight
weeks pregnant,

05:42.000 --> 05:43.069
and she shouldn't
have been.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.532
She had a tubal ligation.

05:44.570 --> 05:46.003
From the look of the scarring,

05:46.040 --> 05:48.076
I'd say she had her tubes tied
a long time ago.

05:48.110 --> 05:49.668
And it was never reversed?

05:49.710 --> 05:51.541
Well, it's surprising
but not impossible.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.116
One out of
every 200 women

05:53.150 --> 05:54.549
gets pregnant after
the procedure.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.787
Unexpected pregnancy
is noteworthy,

05:56.820 --> 05:58.913
but it's not necessarily germane
to our investigation.

05:58.950 --> 06:00.087
Eight weeks is early.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.758
She might not have
even known herself.

06:01.790 --> 06:02.984
Oh, I think she did.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.089
There's elevated levels
of folic acid

06:05.130 --> 06:06.654
and iron
in her blood work.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.122
Pretty good bet

06:08.160 --> 06:09.149
she was taking
prenatal vitamins.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.794
So Ellen decided to keep a baby

06:11.830 --> 06:13.434
she never planned on having.

06:13.470 --> 06:15.836
Husbands have sent their wives
down here for less.

06:22.210 --> 06:24.644
I guess it seems strange,
you know?

06:24.680 --> 06:27.911
Working on our house
the day after...

06:29.490 --> 06:31.617
Truth is, I don't know
what to do with myself.

06:31.650 --> 06:32.856
(coughs quietly)

06:32.890 --> 06:34.517
Something wrong?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.118
No, I just think you, uh,

06:36.160 --> 06:37.525
spilled some paint thinner
on your shirt.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.448
It's pretty
strong.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.424
Sorry. Didn't notice.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.034
Ellen was so into this plan

06:49.070 --> 06:51.732
to remodel
and flip the house.

06:51.770 --> 06:53.635
That's why I missed

06:53.680 --> 06:54.908
her call.

06:54.940 --> 06:56.100
I was on my way upstate

06:56.140 --> 06:57.846
to some salvage place,

06:57.880 --> 06:59.199
on a mission to pick up

06:59.250 --> 07:01.548
some antique doorknobs
that she... found online.

07:01.580 --> 07:02.649
HOLMES:
Will the salvage yard

07:02.690 --> 07:03.748
be able to verify that?

07:03.790 --> 07:05.189
No.

07:05.220 --> 07:07.984
No, I hit traffic on my way up.

07:08.020 --> 07:10.784
By the time I got there,
they were closed,

07:10.830 --> 07:12.457
and I had to turn around
empty-handed.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.821
Thought Ellen
would be pissed,

07:14.860 --> 07:16.999
but if you're asking me
for an alibi,

07:17.030 --> 07:19.567
you must really have no idea
who did this.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.989
We were wondering how you felt
about the pregnancy.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.109
The what?

07:25.640 --> 07:27.631
Your wife was almost
two months pregnant,

07:27.680 --> 07:29.170
Mr. Jacobs,

07:29.210 --> 07:31.178
despite her tubal ligation.

07:31.210 --> 07:32.711
You didn't know, did you?

07:34.180 --> 07:35.909
No.

07:35.950 --> 07:37.087
I didn't.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.782
Did you know about the affair?

07:43.690 --> 07:45.851
You weren't the father,
Mr. Jacobs.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.118
You couldn't have been.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.821
You're unable _
to grow faCIal hair,

07:48.860 --> 07:50.259
your musculature
is underdeveloped,

07:50.300 --> 07:52.268
and your sense of smell
is nonexistent,

07:52.300 --> 07:55.667
as evidenced by your
imperviousness to paint thinner.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.167
You have Kallmann syndrome,

07:57.210 --> 07:58.507
do you not?

07:58.540 --> 08:00.235
People with
Kallmann syndrome

08:00.280 --> 08:02.703
don't go through puberty,
and they can't have children

08:02.750 --> 08:03.944
without hormone
replacement therapy

08:03.980 --> 08:05.208
and fertility
treatments.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.512
You would be
doing yourself

08:06.550 --> 08:08.017
and our investigation
a great service

08:08.050 --> 08:10.086
if you could tell us
the name of the man

08:10.120 --> 08:11.610
that Ellen was sleeping with.

08:11.650 --> 08:13.254
No.

08:13.290 --> 08:14.518
No way.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.959
This is bull.

08:15.990 --> 08:17.878
Ellen was not pregnant,

08:17.930 --> 08:19.249
and she wasn't
havmg an affair.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.599
I'm the husband,
so you think I did it.

08:21.630 --> 08:24.121
You're messing with me, and you
want me to say something stupid.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.569
We can show you

08:25.600 --> 08:27.261
the autopsy report,
Mr. Jacobs.
No.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.097
What you can do is leave.

08:29.140 --> 08:31.062
You want me to talk
to you again?

08:31.110 --> 08:32.873
Make me.

08:32.910 --> 08:34.104
I'll bring my attorney.

08:34.140 --> 08:36.506
Now, get the hell off my porch.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.310
Just because he didn't
know about the pregnancy

08:43.350 --> 08:45.580
doesn't mean he didn't know
about the affair.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.178
Cuckolds and
murdered wives

08:47.220 --> 08:49.279
have a habit of
going together.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.981
Did you buy that story

08:51.030 --> 08:52.793
that he was looking
for doorknobs last night?

08:52.830 --> 08:54.752
I have no opinion
either way.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.722
Should be easy enough
to confirm his story

08:56.770 --> 08:58.260
using traffic
camera footage.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.268
In the meantime, why
don't you pay a visit

09:00.300 --> 09:03.133
to the ob-gyn listed in
Ellen's address book?

09:03.170 --> 09:05.309
If Mr. Jacobs
is innocent,

09:05.340 --> 09:07.171
it might be the other
man in Ellen's life

09:07.210 --> 09:09.235
who reacted negatively
to the pregnancy.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.874
Her doctor may know his name.

09:11.910 --> 09:15.277
I'm sorry, but I don't see
how I can help you.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.810
You were Ellen's doctor;
she talked to you.

09:16.850 --> 09:18.215
And everything
she said

09:18.250 --> 09:20.753
is protected by
doctor-patient confidentiality.

09:20.790 --> 09:22.724
Right. But now
it's a judgment call,

09:22.760 --> 09:24.887
because confidentiality
isn't binding

09:24.930 --> 09:26.659
once a patient
is deceased.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.327
At that point, a doctor
can be more transparent,

09:28.360 --> 09:30.066
especially if you could
help with a murder.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.261
Well, every doctor has his
or her own ethical standards.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.699
These are mine.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.368
Okay, so let's
keep things simple.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.061
How long was Ellen a patient?

09:38.110 --> 09:40.328
Uh, she'd been in twice.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.371
I hardly
knew her.

09:42.410 --> 09:44.674
And was she excited
about becoming a mother?

09:44.710 --> 09:46.200
In my impression?
I think so.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.070
What about the father?
Was he excited?

09:48.120 --> 09:49.348
I wouldn't know.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.608
She came in alone.

09:52.390 --> 09:54.915
Were you aware that her husband
wasn't the father?

09:54.960 --> 09:56.848
I can't answer that.

09:56.890 --> 09:58.323
It's important that we identify
the real father

09:58.360 --> 10:00.248
so that we can figure out...

10:00.300 --> 10:03.098
Mrs. Jacobs didn't come here
to discuss paternity.

10:03.130 --> 10:05.894
She came here to have
a successful pregnancy.

10:06.900 --> 10:07.889
Is that all?

10:07.940 --> 10:09.362
(knock at door)

10:09.400 --> 10:10.867
I'm sorry. The Blue Cross
people are back,

10:10.910 --> 10:12.207
and they're anxious
to speak with you.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.377
Thanks, Deb.
I'll be right there.

10:13.410 --> 10:15.105
I need to handle this.

10:15.140 --> 10:16.801
And I don't think
there's much else to discuss.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.977
I just have
a few more questions.

10:19.010 --> 10:20.238
I can wait.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.269
It's no problem.

10:33.260 --> 10:35.251
*

10:46.310 --> 10:48.232
*

10:48.280 --> 10:49.907
I was mistaken.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.838
You don't know what my
partner looks like naked.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.279
Speak up, would you?
I don't think the guys

10:53.320 --> 10:55.140
in the cell heard you.
Why didn't you just tell me

10:55.180 --> 10:56.374
you were taking the
sergeant's exam on Friday?

10:56.420 --> 10:58.388
Joan told you
she was helping me study?

10:58.420 --> 11:00.388
What do you think?

11:00.420 --> 11:03.059
Think you saw the books
on my desk just now.

11:03.090 --> 11:04.455
The explanation would have
occurred to me sooner

11:04.490 --> 11:06.048
had I ever imagined
you'd be willing

11:06.090 --> 11:07.694
to transfer out
of Major Crimes.

11:07.730 --> 11:09.391
You are aware that your
promotion will require you

11:09.430 --> 11:11.261
to oversee patrolmen
for at least a year?

11:11.300 --> 11:13.063
I'm aware.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.432
If you wanted help studying,
why not just come to me?

11:15.470 --> 11:17.438
I'm a gifted instructor.
Watson is living proof.

11:17.470 --> 11:20.371
Look, you've been through a lot
the last few months.

11:20.410 --> 11:22.776
I didn't want to bother you
till I passed the test.

11:22.810 --> 11:24.072
IfI pass.

11:24.110 --> 11:25.304
Been working a lot of OT lately.

11:25.350 --> 11:26.874
It's got me way behind
on studying.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.342
That's why I asked Joan
for help.

11:28.380 --> 11:29.916
It really is beneath
you, Marcus,

11:29.950 --> 11:31.383
invoking my relapse
to avoid the question.

11:31.420 --> 11:33.217
It's the truth.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.785
Ah, it's not the whole
truth, though, is it?

11:35.820 --> 11:37.424
I don't want to hear
the speech again, okay?

11:37.460 --> 11:38.222
What speech?

11:38.260 --> 11:40.194
You know,
the pep talk you gave me

11:40.230 --> 11:42.289
when I went to work
for the Demographics Unit.

11:42.330 --> 11:44.093
(imitating Holmes' accent):
"The only true police work

11:44.130 --> 11:46.121
"is detective work,
and you're betraying your talent

11:46.170 --> 11:47.797
and wasting your life."

11:47.840 --> 11:49.467
In that instance,
you were mistaking

11:49.500 --> 11:51.400
a step backwards
for a lateral move.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.930
Here, you're clearly
going to advance.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.402
You have my full support.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.408
Anyway, I could always use
friends in medium places.

11:56.440 --> 11:59.876
Well, hey,
as long as it helps you.
I'm gonna talk to Watson.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.808
I'll let her know I'm
taking over your tutelage.
(phone ringing)

12:01.850 --> 12:04.114
Mmm, really not necessary.

12:04.150 --> 12:07.517
Oh. Watson, I was just
talking to your study buddy,

12:07.560 --> 12:09.414
future Sergeant
Marcus Bell.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.485
He told you about the test?
Essentially.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.452
How was your visit
with the doctor?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.195
Ellen's files were a bust.

12:15.230 --> 12:16.788
She never identified
the baby's father.

12:16.830 --> 12:18.366
But I found something else.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.891
She gave the office
a burner e-mail address.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.465
That was the only way they
were supposed to contact her.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.035
Possibly to keep the pregnancy
secret from her husband.

12:26.070 --> 12:28.072
Send it to me.
I'll give it to CCS

12:28.110 --> 12:29.873
so they can open the account.

12:29.910 --> 12:32.378
No need. She really did use the
same password for everything.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.173
Now, there's not much here--

12:34.220 --> 12:36.176
Ellen was pretty good about
deleting her correspondence--

12:36.220 --> 12:37.915
but I was able to find

12:37.950 --> 12:39.986
the last few e-mails she swapped
with the baby's father.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.556
The two of them
seemed pretty confident

12:41.590 --> 12:43.387
that Ernie was still in the dark
about their affair.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.318
Possibly, but I'm not willing

12:45.360 --> 12:47.396
to eliminate him
as a suspect just yet.

12:47.430 --> 12:49.557
I couldn't find
any traffic cam footage

12:49.600 --> 12:52.091
to corroborate
his doorknob alibi.

12:52.130 --> 12:53.563
Do we know the other man's name?

12:53.600 --> 12:56.569
KeyMaster2020@odkermail.com.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.101
Probably not his Christian name.

12:58.140 --> 13:01.109
No, but we might be able
to get that soon enough.

13:01.140 --> 13:03.142
He and Ellen had set up
their next liaison

13:03.180 --> 13:05.000
for the day after tomorrow.
Where?

13:05.050 --> 13:07.439
This is where it gets weird.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.880
They were going to meet
at Sing Sing.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.485
(buzzer sounds)
MAN: Yeah, here it is.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.078
Ellen Jacobs.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.520
Call came in at 2:05 on Monday.

13:17.560 --> 13:20.256
I remember this.
Nice lady.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.325
Wanted to be put on the
visitation list for Friday.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.021
I filled her in on the rules.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.469
She mentioned
she might bring a friend.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.264
I said, "Okay, as long
as he brings a photo ID."

13:28.300 --> 13:29.494
She didn't give you his name?

13:29.540 --> 13:31.508
Uh-uh.
No, we don't require

13:31.540 --> 13:34.338
an advance list of all
potential Vi5itors. Sorry.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.177
At the very
least, you must

13:36.210 --> 13:38.508
require visitors to declare
who they're coming to see.

13:38.550 --> 13:39.539
Course.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.488
Harris Waylon Greer.

13:47.590 --> 13:49.012
I take it
you're both

13:49.060 --> 13:50.618
familiar with
the Triborough Killer.

13:50.660 --> 13:52.958
HOLMES:
Between 1986 and 1992,

13:53.000 --> 13:56.128
H.W. Greer strangled
or suffocated 16 women

13:56.160 --> 13:58.094
in the Bronx, Queens
and Manhattan.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.589
Just like our victim.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.562
HOLMES: Given Greer's MO.
and hunting grounds,

14:02.600 --> 14:05.205
he would be at the top
of our list of suspects

14:05.240 --> 14:07.276
were he not already
within your walls.

14:08.610 --> 14:11.147
Yeah, well, can't pick
your family, huh?

14:11.180 --> 14:12.977
What does that mean?

14:13.020 --> 14:16.615
Your victim, Ellen Jacobs...

14:16.650 --> 14:18.447
she's the Triborough Killer's
daughter.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.497
My poor Megan.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.030
Megan?

14:38.040 --> 14:40.133
Uh, that's the name
her mother and I gave her.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.169
She changed it.

14:41.210 --> 14:43.474
After you became notorious
for murdering 16 women?

14:45.510 --> 14:48.513
I hadn't seen her since...

14:48.550 --> 14:51.519
1993.

14:51.550 --> 14:53.211
Wrote her a few times,

14:53.260 --> 14:55.558
but I never heard back,
and then...

14:55.590 --> 14:57.421
few days ago,
I heard she wanted a visit.

14:57.460 --> 14:58.552
I was...

14:58.590 --> 15:00.592
I was counting the days.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.965
It's bizarre, isn't it?

15:04.000 --> 15:06.525
Her falling prey
to your M.O.

15:06.570 --> 15:09.664
just days before her
first-ever visit to see you.

15:11.310 --> 15:13.335
You think I had something
to do with it?

15:14.680 --> 15:17.001
I'm locked up 24-7.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.610
I don't call anyone.

15:19.650 --> 15:22.619
I don't... write anyone.

15:22.650 --> 15:24.311
They have records
on that kind of thing.

15:24.350 --> 15:25.578
You can check 'em.

15:28.660 --> 15:30.525
But you got the right idea.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.653
Might as well have been me
that...

15:32.690 --> 15:35.158
that put the bag over her face.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.327
What do you mean?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.622
It's in the Bible.

15:39.670 --> 15:43.208
Sins of the father
will be visited upon the child.

15:45.340 --> 15:46.637
This is my fault.

15:46.670 --> 15:48.399
This must be what
it felt like

15:48.440 --> 15:50.203
for the families
of your Victims.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.549
I pay for my sins
every day in this life,

15:53.580 --> 15:57.186
and I fear what's to come
in the next.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.643
That is justice.

15:59.690 --> 16:01.658
My children dying--

16:01.690 --> 16:03.624
that's not.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.525
You have more
than one child?

16:05.560 --> 16:08.120
Nolan, my son.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.128
He changed his name
back then,

16:10.170 --> 16:14.129
just like she did,
to Craig Crismond.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.665
Find him.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.034
Tell him I'm sorry.

16:22.380 --> 16:23.608
Please.

16:26.650 --> 16:29.312
CRAIG: I can't believe
he was worried about me.

16:29.350 --> 16:30.749
I guess I'm supposed
to be touched.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.280
Well, for what it's worth--

16:32.320 --> 16:33.617
and perhaps it's worth
very little--

16:33.660 --> 16:36.356
uh, y-your father appears
to have changed.

16:36.390 --> 16:39.154
He's medicated
and, uh, remorseful.

16:39.190 --> 16:42.796
Too bad he didn't find God and
mood stabilizers 30 years ago.

16:42.830 --> 16:45.697
16 people would still be alive.

16:45.730 --> 16:48.597
Finding out Ellen had been
killed was horrible enough.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.564
We didn't know it had anything
to do with Craig's father.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.373
Well, given the killer's MO,
I would have thought

16:53.410 --> 16:54.570
the connection would have
been qUIte apparent.

16:55.740 --> 16:57.446
When Ernie called
to break the news,

16:57.480 --> 16:59.038
he didn't get
into the details.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.447
Do you think he was trying
to hide the connection?

17:02.480 --> 17:03.708
No.

17:03.750 --> 17:07.550
No, he didn't know
about our father.

17:07.590 --> 17:09.751
The fact that somebody
suffocated Ellen with a bag

17:09.790 --> 17:11.382
wouldn't_ have meant
anything to him.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.125
So she didn't tell
him that she was

17:13.160 --> 17:15.048
the daughter of
a serial killer.

17:15.100 --> 17:18.297
It's a secret we both got good
at keeping a long time ago.

17:19.430 --> 17:20.590
When Greer was arrested,

17:20.640 --> 17:22.699
there was a backlash
against your family?

17:22.740 --> 17:26.699
My mom got the worst of it.

17:26.740 --> 17:29.675
People didn't understand
how she couldn't know.

17:29.710 --> 17:32.747
When we started getting
death threats at the house,

17:32.780 --> 17:35.772
we moved away,
changed our names.

17:35.820 --> 17:38.311
I only came back to New York
a couple years ago.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.783
(children chattering playfully)

17:39.820 --> 17:41.253
Do you think
we're in danger here?

17:41.290 --> 17:42.689
We don't know.

17:42.720 --> 17:45.450
But our captain's looking
into having patrols here

17:45.490 --> 17:46.752
and at your workplaces.

17:46.790 --> 17:48.758
(children laughing)

17:48.800 --> 17:50.165
Have you noticed anyone
lurking about

17:50.200 --> 17:52.088
or had any hang-up
phone calls or...

17:52.130 --> 17:53.290
or anything like that?

17:53.340 --> 17:54.693
No.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.264
No, nothing like that. You?

17:58.370 --> 17:59.735
Look, it had to be
somebody related

17:59.770 --> 18:01.101
to one of the women he killed.

18:01.140 --> 18:02.505
Right?

18:02.540 --> 18:04.349
A family member...

18:04.380 --> 18:06.371
um, somebody who realized
who Ellen really was.

18:06.410 --> 18:07.775
HOLMES: It seems
that the killer

18:07.820 --> 18:10.880
was aware of her connection
to your father.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.718
Whether or not
that person is connected

18:13.760 --> 18:17.218
to one of _the victims--
very difficult to say.

18:17.260 --> 18:19.080
Did you know Ellen
was pregnant?

18:21.760 --> 18:24.695
Uh, we found out yesterday.
Ernie told us.

18:24.730 --> 18:27.392
Were you aware that he
could not have been the father?

18:28.700 --> 18:30.167
We knew about his condition,
yeah.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.666
WATSON:
We'd like to question
the other man,

18:31.710 --> 18:34.679
but so far we haven't been able
to identify him.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.803
Did you know about the affair?

18:36.840 --> 18:38.842
No.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.838
What?

18:41.880 --> 18:45.816
(sighs) Um...
it was about a month ago.

18:45.850 --> 18:48.455
Jen and I were in the city
running some errands,

18:48.490 --> 18:51.459
_ and we saw Ell_en walk
into a restaurant With this guy.

18:51.490 --> 18:52.923
We wondered if
something was up,

18:52.960 --> 18:55.758
but we decided it was
none of our busmess.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.768
Can you describe the man?

18:59.500 --> 19:02.628
We only saw him from the back.
Tall guy. Dark hair.

19:02.670 --> 19:04.900
But the place was called
La Porte Blanc.

19:04.940 --> 19:06.532
Maybe someone there

19:06.570 --> 19:08.379
will remember him.

19:08.410 --> 19:10.401
*

19:16.650 --> 19:18.311
During the course
of that frisking,

19:18.350 --> 19:19.942
there were two deviations
from recommended best practices.

19:19.990 --> 19:21.355
What were they?

19:25.830 --> 19:27.821
Need I remind you time
is of the essence?

19:27.860 --> 19:29.657
Watson will be back
from La Porte Blanc

19:29.700 --> 19:31.793
with the surveillance footage
within the hour.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.798
The Jacobs case, right?
I notice you haven't asked me

19:33.840 --> 19:35.831
for any help with that.
A matter of time.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.599
For now, Watson and I both agree

19:37.640 --> 19:39.608
that your studies
should take priority.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.631
So, the two mistakes--
what were they?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.238
(sighs)

19:43.280 --> 19:45.305
You reached into his pockets
before you patted them.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.749
You can't search pockets
unless you got

19:46.780 --> 19:48.509
probable cause
there might be a weapon.

19:48.550 --> 19:50.415
And what else?

19:50.450 --> 19:52.782
I don't know, man.
Dummy groping isn't on the test.

19:52.820 --> 19:55.459
Are you serious about passing
the sergeant's exam or not?

19:55.490 --> 19:58.323
Course I am.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.692
You don't want to be
a sergeant, do you?

20:00.730 --> 20:04.598
FYI, this is why I went to Joan
for help instead of you.

20:04.630 --> 20:06.621
If you didn't want
the promotion,

20:06.670 --> 20:08.592
why are you taking the test?

20:08.640 --> 20:10.961
You can never just
drop anything, can you?

20:11.010 --> 20:13.433
_Not one of
my particular strengths, no.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.571
_ The truth-- not that
it's any of your bu5iness--

20:19.610 --> 20:20.918
is that I need the money.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.269
Why?

20:22.320 --> 20:25.289
My mom lost her job.

20:25.320 --> 20:28.778
Two years shy of retirement,
they pulled the rug out.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.629
Downsizing.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.252
She'll have to
burn through her savings

20:32.290 --> 20:33.621
till her pension kicks in.

20:33.660 --> 20:37.664
Probably need a little help
down the road, too.

20:37.700 --> 20:40.760
Aanay, promotion comes
with a raise, so...

20:40.800 --> 20:42.290
there it is.

20:42.340 --> 20:43.409
Why didn't you just say so?

20:43.440 --> 20:44.566
If you don't want to leave

20:44.610 --> 20:45.429
the rank of detective, don't.

20:45.470 --> 20:47.028
I'll give you a loan.

20:47.070 --> 20:49.607
I appreciate that,
but I'm not a charity case.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.607
No, I said a loan.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.606
Sorry.

20:52.650 --> 20:54.641
I'm not taking money
from a friend.

20:57.650 --> 21:00.551
Lunch is over. _
I got to get back to the office.

21:02.590 --> 21:04.956
And you're sure
I can't help you?

21:04.990 --> 21:07.458
You are helping me, remember?

21:07.500 --> 21:08.922
Both of you.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.036
HOLMES: Well, Mrs. Jacobs
certainly seems

21:17.070 --> 21:18.560
taken with this gentleman.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.408
Does he ever show his face?

21:21.440 --> 21:23.601
He does when he gets up, but
then a waiter gets in his way.

21:23.650 --> 21:26.448
Otherwise, his back is
to the camera the whole time.

21:28.450 --> 21:29.815
So how'd it go
with Marcus today?

21:29.850 --> 21:31.613
Pooﬂy.

21:31.650 --> 21:33.584
Seems he's less interested
in a promotion

21:33.620 --> 21:35.087
than he is with the accompanying

21:35.120 --> 21:36.587
increase in salary.

21:36.620 --> 21:38.588
Oh, so he just wants a raise?

21:38.630 --> 21:40.621
I gather he's as interested
in playing scoutmaster

21:40.660 --> 21:42.093
to a group of patrolmen

21:42.130 --> 21:44.360
as I would be,
but his mother

21:44.400 --> 21:46.721
recently lost her job,
and he wants to help her out.

21:46.770 --> 21:49.591
He didn't tell me.

21:49.640 --> 21:50.664
Well, he's a proud man,
the detective.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.665
I offered him a loan,

21:51.710 --> 21:53.905
but wouldn't accept.

21:53.940 --> 21:55.669
We're still gonna
help him study?

21:55.710 --> 21:59.544
We are. Although I must admit,
I have lost some enthusiasm.

21:59.580 --> 22:00.672
What's this?

22:02.550 --> 22:04.586
It happens again around dessert.

22:04.620 --> 22:06.508
A girl and her friend approach.

22:06.550 --> 22:09.018
One dangles her keys while
the other takes her picture.

22:09.060 --> 22:12.621
Perhaps he's a celebrity
of some sort.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.628
His e-mail address was
"KeyMaster."

22:14.660 --> 22:16.753
Celebrity locksmith.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.394
No, but if he is

22:21.440 --> 22:22.737
who I think he is,

22:22.770 --> 22:24.704
he does open a
lot of doors.

22:24.740 --> 22:27.334
I've seen this pose before;
we both have.

22:30.410 --> 22:32.401
He's the Jacobs' realtor.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.119
So I took her to lunch.

22:36.150 --> 22:38.584
I'll tell you what, I
took her to dinner, too.

22:38.620 --> 22:40.611
I took her out
almost as many times

22:40.660 --> 22:41.957
as I took her
husband Ernie.

22:41.990 --> 22:43.582
The plot thickens.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.029
I'm saying that meals
with clients

22:45.060 --> 22:46.482
are part of the job.

22:46.530 --> 22:48.054
You got to wine and dine
some people.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.091
That's how I convinced
the Jacobs to sell their house.

22:50.130 --> 22:51.927
They didn't solicit you?

22:51.970 --> 22:53.631
Their neighborhood
is getting hot.

22:53.670 --> 22:55.399
It's about to take off,
and,uh".

22:55.440 --> 22:57.135
I have a lot of clients
looking in that area,

22:57.170 --> 22:58.603
so I've been beating the bushes.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.608
I signed three new homeowners
just last week.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.574
We watched security footage

23:02.610 --> 23:04.544
from your dinner with Ellen
at La Porte Blanc.

23:04.580 --> 23:06.946
Looked like you were
talking about

23:06.980 --> 23:10.040
a lot more than just curb appeal
and square footage.

23:12.990 --> 23:15.959
Okay. I liked her.

23:15.990 --> 23:18.151
She was really warm, you know?
She was sweet.

23:18.190 --> 23:20.590
Look... (sighs)

23:20.630 --> 23:21.949
I feel terrible
about what happened,

23:22.000 --> 23:23.729
but, listen, I'm a married man.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.022
I mean, Ellen and I, we never...

23:26.070 --> 23:28.538
It was just a little flirtation,
that's all.

23:28.570 --> 23:29.730
HOLMES:
You're lying.

23:29.770 --> 23:30.998
Do it again.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.803
Tell us where you were
Monday night.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.899
I was at home
with my wife.

23:34.940 --> 23:36.498
I can't accept an alibi

23:36.540 --> 23:38.701
from anyone with
that particular hairstyle.

23:40.010 --> 23:41.739
That's my mother.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.714
What the_hell are
you getting at?

23:43.750 --> 23:46.218
Why would you think
that I hurt Ellen?

23:46.250 --> 23:48.684
Because her pregnancy was
about to blow your life apart.

23:53.030 --> 23:54.850
She was pregnant?

23:54.900 --> 23:56.925
Her husband
is sterile,

23:56.960 --> 23:59.565
so I think you can guess what
a paternity test would show.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.101
Okay.
(clears throat)

24:04.140 --> 24:06.062
Okay. I'll admit,

24:06.110 --> 24:08.237
there was more to it
with me and Ellen.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.236
We...

24:10.280 --> 24:12.248
Yes, we got together
a few times.

24:12.280 --> 24:15.511
But just because I lied
about that doesn't mean...

24:15.550 --> 24:17.916
Look, I lied because
I love my wife.

24:22.890 --> 24:25.688
You know what?
We're done.

24:25.730 --> 24:28.528
I'm not answering any more
questions without a lavwer.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.164
I think that's a wise
choice, Mr. Clift.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.191
See you again
very soon.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.037
(sighs)

24:47.550 --> 24:48.847
Putting Warren Clift
in the center?

24:48.880 --> 24:50.518
He put himself in the center

24:50.550 --> 24:52.814
when he didn't use a condom
with Ellen Jacobs.

24:52.850 --> 24:54.659
You don't agree?

24:54.690 --> 24:56.282
Well, he seemed
genuinely surprised

24:56.320 --> 24:58.550
to hear about
the pregnancy.

24:58.590 --> 25:01.798
Perhaps he'd begun to worry
she would expose their affair.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.227
to offer her spirit to the gods.

25:06.270 --> 25:08.738
He didn't seem
crazy to me.

25:08.770 --> 25:11.034
In my experience, a grown man
who keeps a photograph

25:11.070 --> 25:14.039
of his mother on his desk
at work is capable of anything.

25:14.080 --> 25:18.039
Harris Waylon Greer suffocated
women with plastic bags.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.741
It seems like we
should be focusing

25:21.780 --> 25:22.940
on his victims'
families.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.641
Hey, are you
listening?

25:24.690 --> 25:25.987
Huh? Yes.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.749
And I think
you're absolutely right.

25:27.790 --> 25:29.781
Yeah, I don't hear
that often enough.

25:33.090 --> 25:36.150
I also...

25:36.200 --> 25:38.168
think that I'm right.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.191
Clift-- I knew I heard
that name before.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.864
Look.

25:45.370 --> 25:46.803
That's the same photo

25:46.840 --> 25:48.671
that Warren Clift
had on his desk.

25:48.710 --> 25:51.679
His mother, Triborough Killer's
third victim,

25:51.710 --> 25:53.644
died in 1988.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.671
You'll recall,
Mr. Clift approached the Jacobs

25:55.720 --> 25:58.109
about selling their home,
not the other way around.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.281
He had to know that Ellen
was Greer's daughter.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.322
I suppose it's the classic
romantic trope.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.659
Boy kills girl, girl's son
pursues boy's daughter,

26:07.700 --> 26:09.156
his intentions
entirely pure.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.668
Purely homicidal, maybe.

26:11.700 --> 26:12.667
Do hope Mr. Clift
has located his attorney,

26:12.700 --> 26:14.759
'cause I'd really like
to speak to him again.

26:23.310 --> 26:25.642
This guy's face is
all over my neighborhood.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.079
Sells a lot of homes.

26:27.110 --> 26:28.941
According to Joan,
he has a lot of motives:

26:28.980 --> 26:31.642
unwanted pregnancy,
an affair being exposed,

26:31.690 --> 26:33.112
avenging his mother's murder.

26:33.150 --> 26:34.788
Well, this warrant
turns up anything,

26:34.820 --> 26:37.118
those'll be the last keys
he holds in his life.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.761
GREGSON:
Hello, ma'am.

26:45.800 --> 26:46.960
My name is Tom Gregson.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.365
This is Detective Bell.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.628
We're here...
WOMAN:
I know.

26:49.670 --> 26:50.739
I was expecting you.

26:50.770 --> 26:52.306
You were?

26:52.340 --> 26:53.409
WOMAN:
Well, yeah.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.101
I want to help
any way that I can.

26:55.140 --> 26:56.368
You're here looking for,

26:56.410 --> 26:58.173
I don't know, clues, right?

27:00.080 --> 27:01.809
Have you been to the hospital?

27:01.850 --> 27:03.112
Hospital?

27:03.150 --> 27:04.412
What hospital?

27:04.450 --> 27:06.645
The one Warren was taken to.

27:06.690 --> 27:08.180
He got attacked
outside one of our listings

27:08.220 --> 27:09.209
in Ditmas last night.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.956
Somebody beat him
with a bat.

27:11.990 --> 27:13.924
Isn't that why you're here?

27:16.030 --> 27:18.362
WATSON:
You're a lucky man.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.698
(sighs) Really?

27:20.740 --> 27:22.696
Someone almost
caved my head in with a bat.

27:24.070 --> 27:25.765
Basilar skull fracture--
most of the time,

27:25.810 --> 27:27.061
something gets severed
and you bleed out,

27:27.110 --> 27:30.409
but looks like
you'll be fine.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.442
Perhaps now, Mr. Clift,

27:32.480 --> 27:35.643
you're finally ready
to start telling the truth.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.315
I told you, I didn't kill Ellen.

27:40.350 --> 27:43.319
You stalked her, you wriggled
your way into her life.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.328
We know about your mother.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.692
We know that she was murdered
by Harris Waylon Greer.

27:47.730 --> 27:49.755
GREGSON:
That's the reason

27:49.800 --> 27:51.222
you killed her, right?

27:51.270 --> 27:53.022
You wanted him to feel
everything you felt

27:53.070 --> 27:54.697
when you lost your mom.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.389
No.

27:56.440 --> 27:57.759
Mr. Clift...

27:57.810 --> 27:58.868
(sighs)

27:58.910 --> 28:01.071
All I wanted...

28:01.110 --> 28:03.305
all I've ever wanted
was to talk to him.

28:05.110 --> 28:06.475
Just look him in the eye
and tell him

28:06.510 --> 28:08.375
what he did to me
and to my family.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.442
Check with the prison;
they'll tell you

28:12.490 --> 28:14.708
I've made dozens of requests
for visitation.

28:14.760 --> 28:18.150
So you were the mystery guest
she was gonna bring with her

28:18.190 --> 28:20.249
when she went
to see him this week.

28:20.290 --> 28:21.928
You're right
that I tracked her down.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.928
I wanted to get to know her...

28:23.970 --> 28:26.962
before I told her who I was.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.298
And when I finally did tell her,
she understood.

28:31.340 --> 28:34.138
The affair... it just happened.

28:34.180 --> 28:35.932
It wasn't part of some plan.

28:35.980 --> 28:38.801
The pregnancy was
equally unplanned.

28:38.850 --> 28:41.273
Perhaps she threatened
to tell your wife.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.847
(sighs) No, she never said
a word to me, I swear.

28:44.890 --> 28:47.142
I didn't know she was pregnant
until you told me.

28:49.190 --> 28:51.181
(sighs) Look, what
happened to me

28:51.230 --> 28:55.394
last night can't be
just a coincidence.

28:55.430 --> 28:57.227
Someone killed Ellen
three nights ago,

28:57.260 --> 28:59.296
and then, last night,
they tried to kill me,

28:59.330 --> 29:00.866
the guy she was sleeping with?

29:01.870 --> 29:03.861
You think it was
her husband Ernie.

29:03.910 --> 29:07.903
He found out about us, he killed
her, he almost killed me.

29:07.940 --> 29:09.373
GREGSON:
You told the police

29:09.410 --> 29:12.106
you didn't see the face
of the guy who attacked you.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.975
No, but do the math.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.817
Who else could it be?

29:16.850 --> 29:18.841
A moment outside.

29:27.860 --> 29:30.556
The chances that Mr. Jacobs
attacked Mr. Clift

29:30.600 --> 29:32.158
are actually not that bad.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.259
See this crescent-shaped wound?

29:34.300 --> 29:37.337
It suggests he wasn't hit with
a baseball bat, as he believes,

29:37.370 --> 29:38.928
but with a scaffolding pipe.

29:38.970 --> 29:41.404
Saw plenty of that lying around

29:41.440 --> 29:43.169
at Mr. Jacobs' home
the other day.

29:43.210 --> 29:45.246
Okay, say you're right.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.907
Say Ernie Jacobs
did do this.

29:46.950 --> 29:48.315
Doesn't mean
he killed Ellen.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.811
No, but I'd say
it's worth

29:50.850 --> 29:53.546
having Marcus
pay him a visit.

29:55.020 --> 29:56.282
BELL: Do you understand
these rights

29:56.320 --> 29:57.480
as I've read
them to you?

29:57.520 --> 29:59.988
Yes, but you're making
a mistake.

30:00.030 --> 30:01.895
I think you're
projecting, Ernie.

30:01.930 --> 30:02.919
You see that blood?

30:02.960 --> 30:04.598
You missed a spot.

30:04.630 --> 30:06.325
It was a cute idea,
reattaching this section here

30:06.370 --> 30:07.860
when you were done
beating on Warren Clift,

30:07.900 --> 30:09.436
but you should've
cleaned it better.

30:09.470 --> 30:12.598
The lip of this connector
left a distinctive mark.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.005
You might as well
have signed your work.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.530
I rented this equipment.

30:15.580 --> 30:16.604
If that's blood,

30:16.640 --> 30:18.847
then it came
from someplace else.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.142
We got a witness
who saw your truck

30:20.180 --> 30:21.613
speeding away
from the scene last night.

30:21.650 --> 30:23.618
And you've heard of DNA, right?

30:23.650 --> 30:25.982
You think this blood isn't
gonna be a match for Warren?

30:26.020 --> 30:27.487
Look on the bright side.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.112
If you hadn't have stopped
when you did,

30:29.160 --> 30:30.582
you'd have to worry
about two murder charges.

30:33.490 --> 30:35.321
Hey, listen!

30:35.360 --> 30:37.055
I didn't kill my wife.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.499
He's the bastard
who did this!

30:40.030 --> 30:41.566
You can't blame me
for wanting him dead.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.238
Look, I'd be more inclined
to believe you

30:43.270 --> 30:44.862
if you hadn't stood right here

30:44.910 --> 30:46.400
two days ago and swore
to my colleagues

30:46.440 --> 30:48.579
you had no idea your wife
was having an affair.

30:48.610 --> 30:51.147
Now, suddenly, you know
just who to brain with a pipe?

30:51.180 --> 30:55.014
I didn't know until after
they told me she was pregnant.

30:55.050 --> 30:56.472
Then I thought about

30:56.520 --> 30:59.387
who she'd been
spending time with.

30:59.420 --> 31:02.014
It wasn't hard to figure out.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.925
Look, either way,
attacking Mr. Clift

31:03.960 --> 31:05.882
is gonna make it easy
to get a warrant

31:05.930 --> 31:07.329
to search inside your home.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.225
You left any evidence
you killed Ellen,

31:09.260 --> 31:11.194
we'll find it.

31:15.670 --> 31:17.297
WATSON :
Hey.

31:17.340 --> 31:19.433
Hey, your man Ernie
is all booked and tucked away.

31:19.470 --> 31:20.937
But he won't talk
without an attorney.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.936
His bail hearing's tomorrow.

31:22.980 --> 31:24.470
You think there
will be new charges

31:24.510 --> 31:25.670
filed against him by then?

31:25.710 --> 31:27.439
Guy showed
his true colors, right?

31:27.480 --> 31:29.016
He knew about his wife's affair.

31:29.050 --> 31:30.574
He's got a temper.

31:30.620 --> 31:32.440
Your partner's
at the Jacobs' house?

31:32.490 --> 31:34.310
Along with CSU.
He's digging in for the night.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.987
He said he'd call
if he ﬁnds anything.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.988
In the meantime,
he wanted to make sure

31:38.030 --> 31:39.429
you're doing okay
with your studies.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.997
Oh, I'm up to
uniform regulations.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.590
Did you know that between
November 2 and April 30,

31:44.630 --> 31:47.519
it's the responsibility of
the lieutenant platoon commander

31:47.570 --> 31:49.993
to authorize the wearing of
the short sleeve uniform shirts

31:50.040 --> 31:51.530
whenever the temperature
for a specific tour

31:51.570 --> 31:52.969
is expected to rise

31:53.010 --> 31:54.204
above 70 degrees
Fahrenheit?

31:54.240 --> 31:56.037
I did not know that.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.071
But now that you do,
it's exciting.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.341
This is for you.

32:01.380 --> 32:03.109
What is it?

32:03.150 --> 32:04.708
It's a hypothetical
case study

32:04.750 --> 32:06.388
that Sherlock and
I put together.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.285
Your assignment is to lay
out every procedural step

32:08.320 --> 32:11.050
necessary to locate
and serve a subpoena

32:11.090 --> 32:13.229
to the reluctant
witness in the file.

32:13.260 --> 32:16.991
You realize most of this
won't even be on the exam?

32:17.030 --> 32:19.362
We don't believe in
teaching to the test.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.436
I don't know if I'd
have time for this.

32:21.470 --> 32:22.960
I mean, the test is in two days.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.137
Marcus, you trust us, right?

32:25.170 --> 32:27.058
I trust you.

32:27.110 --> 32:28.270
Okay, then take my word.

32:28.310 --> 32:31.006
This is everything
you're gonna need.

32:39.050 --> 32:40.381
ELLEN (recording):
Oh, my God.

32:40.420 --> 32:42.115
No. Stop it!

32:42.160 --> 32:45.129
No! No! (screams)

32:46.030 --> 32:47.383
Oh, my God. No.

32:47.430 --> 32:49.022
Stop it!

32:49.060 --> 32:51.426
No! No! (screams)

32:53.200 --> 32:54.462
Oh, my God. No.

32:54.500 --> 32:55.762
Stop it!

32:55.800 --> 32:57.461
No! No! (screams)

32:57.500 --> 32:59.764
Hey, when did you get back
from the Jacobs' house?

32:59.810 --> 33:02.028
Short while ago.

33:03.140 --> 33:05.074
Was this Ellen's?

33:05.110 --> 33:06.771
HOLMES: It's her
in the pictures.

33:06.810 --> 33:09.278
Only, back then,
she was known as Megan.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.540
ELLEN:
Oh, my God. No.

33:12.590 --> 33:15.058
Stop it! No! No!
Why are you still
listening to that?

33:15.090 --> 33:17.718
(Ellen screams)
I believe I know
who killed Ellen Jacobs.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.318
To my great surprise,

33:19.360 --> 33:22.022
it was not her husband
or her lover.

33:22.060 --> 33:23.357
But it was someone

33:23.400 --> 33:24.492
she trusted
a great deal.

33:24.530 --> 33:25.792
VVho?

33:25.830 --> 33:28.162
We're taught early on
that no means no.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.691
But the first time
Ellen says it on this recording,

33:30.740 --> 33:32.207
she means something else.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.605
Oh, my God.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.107
No. Stop it!

33:35.140 --> 33:36.072
No! No! (screams)

33:36.110 --> 33:38.544
This is Ellen and her brother,

33:38.580 --> 33:42.038
Craig Crismond,
in a simpler time.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.810
Before they felt compelled
to change their names.

33:44.850 --> 33:46.784
She was Megan.

33:46.820 --> 33:49.118
He was Nolan.

33:50.220 --> 33:51.653
There's an inscription
on the back.

33:54.260 --> 33:56.558
"Me and No,
Christmas '91."

33:56.600 --> 33:57.794
"NO."

33:57.830 --> 34:00.822
Her nickname for Nolan.

34:00.870 --> 34:02.360
Oh, my God. No.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.435
Stop it!

34:03.470 --> 34:05.358
No! No! (screams)

34:05.410 --> 34:07.162
The first No.

34:07.210 --> 34:08.507
She saw him
in the backseat.

34:08.540 --> 34:10.076
She was saying
his name.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.558
You guys cleaning your aquarium?

34:21.590 --> 34:23.080
WATSON: Actually,
the precinct

34:23.120 --> 34:24.155
doesn't have an aquarium.

34:24.190 --> 34:25.452
We bought those this morning.

34:25.490 --> 34:27.219
We went to the same store

34:27.260 --> 34:29.524
where you get your koi,
as a matter of fact.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.221
Koi and goldfish
are close cousins.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.124
They're both
freshwater fish.

34:33.170 --> 34:35.138
The clerk at the store
put a few drops

34:35.170 --> 34:36.637
of dechlorinator in the water.

34:36.670 --> 34:38.228
He had to.
Otherwise, the chlorine

34:38.270 --> 34:40.363
from the tap water
would burn their gills.

34:40.410 --> 34:43.174
Sodium thiosulfate is good
for their respiratory system.

34:43.210 --> 34:45.701
Same cannot be said
for human beings.

34:46.910 --> 34:49.515
I thought we were here
to talk about Ernie.

34:49.550 --> 34:51.245
Mr. Crismond,
would it surprise you

34:51.290 --> 34:52.882
that the ME. found traces

34:52.920 --> 34:56.083
_of sodium thiosulfate
in your Sister's lungs?

34:57.720 --> 35:00.587
It came from the bag you used
to suffocate her.

35:00.630 --> 35:02.848
She inhaled it
with her last few breaths.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.765
(chuckles)

35:06.930 --> 35:09.296
First, you thought
Ernie killed Ellen.

35:09.340 --> 35:10.898
Then it was
that piece of garbage

35:10.940 --> 35:12.134
she was having an affair with.

35:12.170 --> 35:13.239
Now it's me?

35:13.270 --> 35:14.703
Now it's you.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.601
We know you killed her.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.743
We don't know why.

35:20.780 --> 35:24.284
So we thought you might
appreciate this time to...

35:24.320 --> 35:26.208
enlighten us.

35:28.290 --> 35:32.158
Uh, someone used a bag
like that one

35:32.190 --> 35:33.623
to kill Ellen.

35:33.660 --> 35:36.151
That store you went to
sells hundreds of fish a year,

35:36.200 --> 35:38.293
maybe thousands.
You're right.

35:38.330 --> 35:39.797
Lots of people buy fish there.

35:39.830 --> 35:42.799
But only one person had
a spare key to Ellen's car.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.206
ELLEN:
Oh, my God. No.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.207
Stop it!

35:46.240 --> 35:48.333
No! No! (screams)

35:48.380 --> 35:50.371
HOLMES:
Before Ellen died,
she left a message

35:50.410 --> 35:52.674
on her home phone,
but you know this, of course,

35:52.710 --> 35:54.348
'cause you were there.

35:54.380 --> 35:56.814
GREGSON:
We know the killer
was lying in wait

35:56.850 --> 35:58.249
in the backseat.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.279
No sign of forced entry.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.947
But then again,
that makes sense.

36:00.990 --> 36:03.311
Because you used your own key.

36:03.360 --> 36:06.249
Oh, my God. No.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.520
Stop it! No! No! (screams)
Would you please stop that?

36:08.560 --> 36:10.721
Is it difficult to hear her
saying your name?

36:10.760 --> 36:12.227
Oh, my God. No.

36:12.270 --> 36:13.294
Stop it! No! No!
She saw you, Craig.

36:13.330 --> 36:14.365
(screams)
Or can I call you "No"?

36:14.400 --> 36:15.628
She saw you, No.

36:15.670 --> 36:18.366
Oh, my God. No.
Could you turn it off?

36:18.410 --> 36:20.230
Stop it! No! No! (screams)
I...

36:20.270 --> 36:22.602
Can you imagine hearing this
over and over again in court?

36:22.640 --> 36:24.779
Oh, my God. No. Stop it!
Can you imagine?

36:24.810 --> 36:27.244
No! No! (screams)
Your own sister just-just
begging you not to kill her.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.975
Oh, my God. No.
You changed your name,

36:29.020 --> 36:31.488
but you didn't really change
who you are, did you?

36:31.520 --> 36:33.545
Stop it! No! No! (screams)
You're Nolan Greer.
You're your father's son.

36:33.590 --> 36:36.252
Oh, my God. No.
I am nothing like him!

36:36.290 --> 36:37.314
Stop it! No! No! (screams)

36:37.360 --> 36:39.453
No, he killed
complete strangers.

36:39.490 --> 36:40.752
You killed your own sister.

36:40.790 --> 36:42.257
Stop it!

36:42.300 --> 36:43.619
She asked you to stop
over and over again!

36:43.660 --> 36:46.390
She asked you stop, stop, stop,
but you didn't!

36:46.430 --> 36:49.365
Oh, my God. No. Stop it!
We had a deal.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.332
(recording stops playing)

36:50.370 --> 36:53.498
(sighs)

36:53.540 --> 36:56.771
He was a monster.

36:56.810 --> 36:58.744
And he was a
part of us.

36:58.780 --> 37:00.702
We were a part of him.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.472
And we couldn't change that,

37:03.520 --> 37:06.683
but we could make sure
that the line ended with us.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.915
You have two children.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.019
No, I don't.

37:11.060 --> 37:13.688
Jennifer and I adopted.

37:13.730 --> 37:17.257
I had a vasectomy 20 years ago.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.894
(laughs)
Megan...

37:19.930 --> 37:22.569
Ellen, she had her tubes tied.

37:24.340 --> 37:26.001
Then last month,
she told me what had happened.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.860
She was... pregnant.

37:27.910 --> 37:29.707
She was gonna...

37:29.740 --> 37:31.503
she was gonna keep it.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.871
So you killed her?

37:33.910 --> 37:35.548
(sobbing)

37:35.580 --> 37:38.310
We had a deal.

37:39.890 --> 37:42.279
(indistinct chatter)

37:50.330 --> 37:51.627
I miss something?
You already close another case?

37:51.670 --> 37:54.468
As a matter of fact,
Detective, you did.

37:54.500 --> 37:57.298
That's Rollo Bastain
from the case study

37:57.340 --> 37:58.602
that we assigned you.

37:58.640 --> 37:59.709
He was exactly

37:59.740 --> 38:01.037
where you said he would be.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.435
Silver Bells Bowling
in Dongan Hills.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.970
My report was about

38:04.010 --> 38:06.604
a missing witness
named Didier McDiaz.

38:06.650 --> 38:07.878
He was fictional.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.548
You were misled
by Watson and myself.

38:09.580 --> 38:12.413
McDiaz is Rollo Bastain.

38:12.450 --> 38:13.542
Not a recalcitrant
Witness,

38:13.590 --> 38:15.615
but a wanted fugitive
bail jumper.

38:15.660 --> 38:17.651
All that information
in the file Joan gave me?

38:17.690 --> 38:19.351
Names were changed

38:19.390 --> 38:20.857
to protect the guilty.
The rest was accurate.

38:20.890 --> 38:23.029
You should know
that we so trust your skill,

38:23.060 --> 38:24.698
we didn't even check your work.

38:25.770 --> 38:28.295
It's for you.

38:31.670 --> 38:34.901
Check for 36 grand?

38:34.940 --> 38:39.104
Mr. Bastain has a $40,000
bounty on his head.
Holmes...

38:39.150 --> 38:41.448
I know that you're forbidden
from accepting money

38:41.480 --> 38:42.742
from bringing
a fugitive to justice.

38:42.780 --> 38:44.077
Your mother, however, is not.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.384
Check's made
out to her.

38:46.420 --> 38:47.739
(chuckles)

38:47.790 --> 38:50.088
So, you said
the bounty is for 40.

38:50.120 --> 38:53.385
Why is Mom only getting 36?

38:53.430 --> 38:56.354
Out of respect for your strong
feelings towards charity,

38:56.400 --> 38:58.368
I'm taking a ten percent
finder's fee.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.662
(quiet laugh)

38:59.700 --> 39:01.019
All right,
I got to go.

39:01.070 --> 39:02.560
Gotta find
the right bleach to get

39:02.600 --> 39:04.431
some blood out of my space suit.

39:04.470 --> 39:05.562
Any ideas?

39:05.610 --> 39:07.066
Good luck.

39:07.110 --> 39:08.771
Yeah, good luck to you, too.

39:08.810 --> 39:10.607
If you still want
to be a sergeant.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.800
* Sound and color *

39:11.850 --> 39:14.375
* This life ain't like it was

39:14.420 --> 39:18.481

39:18.520 --> 39:19.987

39:22.490 --> 39:24.458

39:24.490 --> 39:26.583

just awful strange *

39:26.630 --> 39:28.120
