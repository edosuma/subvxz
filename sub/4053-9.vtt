09:23.085 --> 09:24.218
And they're gonna want
a picture of the two of you.

09:24.252 --> 09:26.253
I was thinking maybe
the Central Park Boathouse?

09:29.057 --> 09:30.858
We're not doing
an announcement.

09:30.892 --> 09:31.992
What?

09:32.027 --> 09:33.360
Mike and I,
we're not interested in this.

09:33.395 --> 09:34.462
[scoffs]

09:34.496 --> 09:35.830
I don't understand.

09:35.864 --> 09:37.164
When you read your cousin
Nicole's announcement,

09:37.199 --> 09:38.766
you didn't have
a problem with it.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.800
'Cause something like this
is right for Nicole.

09:39.835 --> 09:42.103
It's not right for me.

09:42.137 --> 09:44.004
You mean it's not
right for Mike?

09:44.039 --> 09:46.107
Oh, come on, Mom.
What are you talking about?

09:46.141 --> 09:47.174
Two years ago,
you wouldn't have had a problem

09:47.209 --> 09:48.375
with something like this.

09:48.410 --> 09:49.777
Well, it's not two years ago,

09:49.811 --> 09:51.545
and this is how we both feel.

09:51.580 --> 09:54.882
So I'm just asking you
to respect my wishes

09:54.916 --> 09:59.655
because we have
so much more to go over, okay?

10:01.056 --> 10:02.423
<i>I'm telling you</i>
<i>it's Cutie Pie Cosmetics.</i>

10:02.457 --> 10:03.724
Joan's ready to retire.

10:03.759 --> 10:05.392
No one gives a shit
about Joan Walsh's business.

10:05.427 --> 10:06.694
It's Nader Communications.

10:06.728 --> 10:07.895
<i>Why, because they're</i>
<i>you're client?</i>

10:07.929 --> 10:09.163
No, because
they were Jack's client

10:09.197 --> 10:10.598
and now they're my client.

10:10.632 --> 10:11.799
So this is all about you?

10:11.833 --> 10:13.334
- Louis, calm down.
- No, this is all about you.

10:13.368 --> 10:14.568
You know what?
You're the one who gave

10:14.603 --> 10:16.003
Hardman the opening he needed.

10:16.037 --> 10:17.338
- <i>Did you hear what I just said?</i>
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

10:17.372 --> 10:18.706
Yeah, you heard me.
This wouldn't be happening

10:18.740 --> 10:20.107
if you didn't try to suspend me.

10:20.142 --> 10:21.242
After you punched me
in the face.

10:21.276 --> 10:22.343
If you really want
to know who's at fault here,

10:22.377 --> 10:23.477
why don't you take a look
in the mirror?

10:23.512 --> 10:24.945
That's enough.

10:24.980 --> 10:26.647
<i>This is exactly</i>
<i>what Hardman wants.</i>

10:26.681 --> 10:28.783
He's trying to get us
to turn on each other.

10:28.817 --> 10:31.051
Well, the fight is out there,
not in here,

10:31.086 --> 10:33.854
and we have to figure out
who Hardman's target is.

10:35.223 --> 10:36.257
Where the hell are you going?

10:36.291 --> 10:37.558
You're right,
the fight is out there,

10:37.592 --> 10:40.761
but Jack Soloff's in here.

10:40.796 --> 10:42.730
You think it's a good idea
to let him go after Jack?

10:42.764 --> 10:44.498
What's he gonna do?
Make him less on our side?

10:44.533 --> 10:46.333
[sighs]
You're right.

10:46.368 --> 10:48.169
There's more important things
to do here anyway.

10:48.203 --> 10:49.503
Yeah, and number one
on the list

10:49.538 --> 10:51.338
is if you think that Hardman's
really going after

10:51.373 --> 10:53.413
Nader Communications,
then we need to get over there

10:53.441 --> 10:54.608
and warn them.

10:54.643 --> 10:56.377
It's not Nader,
it's McKernon Motors.

10:56.411 --> 10:57.578
It can't be McKernon.
They're too small.

10:57.612 --> 10:58.913
Not since we did
that battery deal.

10:58.947 --> 11:00.014
And I know
what you're gonna say,

11:00.048 --> 11:01.782
"Avery McKernon's estate
still owns too much

11:01.817 --> 11:04.051
of the stock,"
but not anymore.

11:04.085 --> 11:05.085
Who bought it?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.153
It doesn't matter
who bought it.

11:06.188 --> 11:07.254
It matters
who the attorney of record is.

11:07.289 --> 11:09.657
- Let me guess, Daniel Hardman.
- Exactly.

11:09.691 --> 11:11.926
Goddamn it.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.360
Harvey, what are you doing?

11:13.395 --> 11:14.762
I'm going
to see Dominic Barone.

11:14.796 --> 11:16.730
- Well, then I'm going with you.
- No, you're not.

11:16.765 --> 11:18.065
They're my oldest client,

11:18.099 --> 11:19.533
and this is something
I have to do.

11:19.568 --> 11:21.936
Harvey, this is a client
that you gave to me and Louis.

11:21.970 --> 11:23.304
Yeah, and you were
smart enough

11:23.338 --> 11:24.772
to figure out
they were the target.

11:24.806 --> 11:26.106
Now I need you
to use that brain

11:26.141 --> 11:29.143
to start figuring out
how we're gonna get out of this.

11:29.177 --> 11:30.711
What are you gonna do?

11:30.745 --> 11:32.479
I'm gonna look Dominic Barone
in the eye

11:32.514 --> 11:35.082
and tell him I'm the reason
this is happening.

11:37.384 --> 11:38.818
Jack, I need to talk to you.

11:39.316 --> 11:40.465
You can save your breath,
Louis.

11:40.501 --> 11:41.800
I know what you're here to say.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.268
You're here to tell me
not to go against

11:43.270 --> 11:45.804
your precious
Harvey and Jessica.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.823
No, I'm here to tell you
that you have no idea

11:47.858 --> 11:49.441
who you're in bed with.

11:49.493 --> 11:52.377
Well, I appreciate
your concern for my well-being,

11:52.412 --> 11:55.013
but I can handle myself.
No you can't.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.348
What difference does it make,
Louis?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.283
It's too late.
It's not too late.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.935
You think if
I suddenly abandon Daniel,

11:59.987 --> 12:02.254
Jessica's just gonna welcome
me back with open arms?

12:02.289 --> 12:04.523
Yes, you don't know
how forgiving she can be.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.291
I trust her.
The only thing she's going

12:06.326 --> 12:07.859
to forgive me with
is a knife in the back.

12:07.911 --> 12:09.594
Jack, listen to me.

12:09.630 --> 12:12.497
Daniel Hardman
treated me like a son.

12:12.533 --> 12:14.833
He promoted me
to senior partner,

12:14.868 --> 12:16.334
used me to take over the firm.

12:16.370 --> 12:19.170
After he lost power,
he turns around

12:19.206 --> 12:21.406
and slaps me
with a sexual harassment claim.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.824
I know.
Monica Eaton.

12:22.860 --> 12:25.787
But what you don't know
is that it was bullshit.

12:28.682 --> 12:32.350
He betrayed me.

12:32.386 --> 12:34.986
Humiliated me.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.521
And after I finally
confronted him about it,

12:36.557 --> 12:39.824
he tells me...

12:39.860 --> 12:43.111
that I got
what I always wanted.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.430
So, Jack, believe me,
if you think this man

12:45.465 --> 12:48.533
cares about you, he doesn't.

12:48.569 --> 12:50.168
I know what kind of man
he is, Louis.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.304
Then why are you siding
with him?

12:52.339 --> 12:53.572
I'll tell you why.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.107
He promised to do something
Jessica never would.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.342
Put my name on the wall.

12:57.394 --> 12:59.344
What if she would?

12:59.379 --> 13:00.445
You're not in reality.

13:00.497 --> 13:02.013
Jack, she did it for me.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.282
Even if I wanted
to go with you, I couldn't.

13:04.318 --> 13:06.084
He's got something on you,
doesn't he?

13:06.086 --> 13:07.936
This conversation is over.

13:17.314 --> 13:18.947
Harvey, what the hell?

13:18.982 --> 13:20.448
I just to notification
of a tender offer.

13:20.484 --> 13:21.733
They're coming after
my company.

13:21.785 --> 13:23.034
I know,
that's why I'm here.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.102
So they sent
the big guns to fight

13:24.137 --> 13:25.604
because it's a hostile takeover?

13:25.639 --> 13:27.272
I'm not here
because it's a hostile takeover.

13:27.324 --> 13:29.374
I'm here because
this whole thing is my fault.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.642
What do you mean your fault?

13:30.694 --> 13:31.993
The reason you're
in the crosshairs is because

13:32.045 --> 13:34.379
Daniel Hardman
has a vendetta against me.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.513
You're telling me
we just closed a deal

13:35.565 --> 13:37.582
that ensures
this company's future

13:37.618 --> 13:39.084
and you put it in jeopardy
because you pissed off

13:39.119 --> 13:40.318
your former partner?

13:40.354 --> 13:41.486
Yes, that's
what I'm telling you.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.021
God damn it.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.456
Well what do you
want me to do, Dominic?

13:44.508 --> 13:46.725
I want you to stop being
an asshole to people.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.910
It's too late for that.

13:48.962 --> 13:52.097
But it may not be too late
for this.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.698
Drop us as your attorneys.

13:53.734 --> 13:54.683
What?

13:54.718 --> 13:57.068
As long as
you're connected to us,

13:57.104 --> 13:58.536
there's gonna be
a target on your back.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.605
You let us go,
there's a chance it goes away.

14:00.657 --> 14:01.856
Harvey.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.241
If I was just gonna
cut you loose because

14:03.276 --> 14:04.759
someone hates you,
I wouldn't have hired you

14:04.795 --> 14:07.012
in the fist place,
because we both know

14:07.047 --> 14:09.247
I used to hate you.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.149
Thanks, Dominic.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.851
- So what are we gonna do?
- I'll let you know.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.219
But I'll tell you this:

14:14.271 --> 14:17.022
They want a war,
they got a war.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.062
Hey, Rach, do you have
that Neilson brief for Louis

14:24.097 --> 14:25.096
from last month?

14:25.098 --> 14:26.564
No, I don't.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.615
Are you sure?
Because he keeps telling me

14:27.651 --> 14:28.700
that you have it.

14:28.735 --> 14:29.801
And I keep telling him I don't

14:29.836 --> 14:30.802
and I have more
important things to do

14:30.837 --> 14:32.337
than sit around
and answer the same question

14:32.372 --> 14:34.205
every other day.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.874
And I have better things
to do with my time

14:35.909 --> 14:38.309
than to be spoken to that way.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.679
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

14:40.714 --> 14:45.717
Rachel, what's going on?

14:45.752 --> 14:46.851
I just had lunch
with my mom

14:46.887 --> 14:49.754
to talk about our wedding,
and she wants to put

14:49.790 --> 14:51.489
an announcement
in "The New York Times."

14:51.525 --> 14:52.590
Oh, my God.

14:52.626 --> 14:53.658
Did you tell her
that she can't do that?

14:53.694 --> 14:55.160
Yeah.
I made up some story

14:55.195 --> 14:56.678
about it being snobby,
but Donna, that's just

14:56.713 --> 14:57.929
the tip of the iceberg.

14:57.964 --> 14:58.980
What are you talking about?

14:59.032 --> 15:00.865
This is her
proposed guest list.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.234
It is 300 people
and it includes

15:03.286 --> 15:06.938
the Attorney General
and the Dean of Harvard Law.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.392
What am I gonna do?

15:10.427 --> 15:11.493
You're gonna tell her
that you don't want

15:11.528 --> 15:13.178
a big wedding and that's that.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.379
And if I do that,
she's gonna know

15:14.381 --> 15:15.480
that something's not right.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.365
Rachel, this is
the type of argument

15:17.401 --> 15:19.501
that every mother has
with every daughter

15:19.536 --> 15:22.353
about her wedding.

15:22.389 --> 15:25.290
She's never gonna think
that Mike's a fraud.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.231
- How'd Dominic take it?
- He took it fine.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.399
Good, 'cause I have a plan.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.667
Let's hear it.

15:35.702 --> 15:36.634
We go to the last place
they'd ever expect

15:36.670 --> 15:37.836
and we offer to merge.
Where?

15:37.888 --> 15:38.937
Fletcher Engines.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.105
Are you crazy?

15:40.107 --> 15:42.107
We go to Fletcher,
they're gonna kick Dominic out,

15:42.159 --> 15:43.708
Jack gains power.

15:43.744 --> 15:45.076
Might as well have
let McKernon get bought out

15:45.128 --> 15:46.544
in the first place.

15:46.580 --> 15:47.979
Then the only other option
that's even remotely possible

15:48.031 --> 15:50.115
is we take them private.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.151
That actually might work.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.619
Come to think of it,
why the hell didn't you

15:54.621 --> 15:56.087
just say that to me
in the first place?

15:56.123 --> 15:58.556
Because I knew you'd shit on
whatever my first idea was

15:58.592 --> 15:59.891
and that you'd be open
to the backup.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.359
You're telling me
you set up a straw man idea

16:01.394 --> 16:03.595
to manipulate me
into liking your real idea?

16:03.630 --> 16:05.196
- Yep.
- How long you been doing that?

16:05.232 --> 16:06.598
Peabody versus Danthorpe.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.833
Son of a bitch.

16:08.869 --> 16:09.968
All right, smart guy.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.436
Now where are we gonna get
the money for the equity?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.121
I'll tell you where.
Sidwell and Gianopolous.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.589
<i>Is that another</i>
<i>straw man idea?</i>

16:14.624 --> 16:15.740
Because you'll never get
the two of them

16:15.776 --> 16:18.176
to go in on a deal together.
They hate each other.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.911
Oh, those two hating
each other is exactly

16:19.946 --> 16:22.046
what I'm counting on.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.285
<i>- Hey, Mom.</i>
- Oh, Rachel!

16:27.320 --> 16:28.753
<i>You're just in time.</i>

16:28.805 --> 16:31.022
The caterer dropped off
some samples.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.791
I was just about to try them,
but it'll be much more fun

16:32.826 --> 16:33.792
if we do this together.

16:33.844 --> 16:35.593
Okay, Mom,
but before you pout that.

16:35.629 --> 16:37.929
I don't think that
the crostini travels very well.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.931
Mom, please.

16:39.983 --> 16:42.100
I know that you have given this
a lot of thought,

16:42.135 --> 16:44.435
but I need to talk to you
about the size of the wedding.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.871
It's way too big.

16:46.907 --> 16:48.706
I have given this
a lot of thought,

16:48.742 --> 16:50.608
and 30 people
at a wedding

16:50.610 --> 16:52.844
isn't going to get
a chef like this.

16:52.879 --> 16:53.928
Right, but I'm not
having a wedding

16:53.964 --> 16:54.964

16:55.015 --> 16:56.397

to talk about the menu.

16:56.449 --> 17:00.118
I'm here to talk about
the guest list.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.820
Rachel, did I ever tell you
what your father did

17:01.822 --> 17:04.222
three weeks
before we got married?

17:04.257 --> 17:07.025
Bought two tickets to Bermuda
and said we're eloping.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.476
And he did that
because he didn't want

17:08.512 --> 17:09.993
to deal with my mother.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.230
But you know what stopped me?

17:12.265 --> 17:14.449

doing that to my mom

17:14.501 --> 17:16.067

But I told you
this isn't about Mike,

17:18.655 --> 17:20.070
and it isn't
about eloping.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.106

17:35.922 --> 17:37.255
Yes, there is something
that I'm not telling you,

17:37.257 --> 17:39.974

it's really hard for me

17:40.010 --> 17:43.094

17:48.101 --> 17:49.267

we will have to elope.

the only thing we knew
about Jack Soloff

18:37.502 --> 18:39.769
is that he bills more hours
than anyone but me.

18:39.771 --> 18:40.937

he just woke up one day

18:40.972 --> 18:42.739

The question isn't
who's in charge between

24:59.652 --> 25:01.218
Then how about you commit
to buying the next round

25:01.270 --> 25:02.319
for a change?

25:02.355 --> 25:04.121
I'd love to,
but I can't.

25:04.156 --> 25:06.106
I got to go meet Rachel
at her mom's.

25:06.158 --> 25:07.575
Talk about some wedding stuff.

25:07.627 --> 25:09.093
Ugh.
I'd love to join you,

25:09.145 --> 25:10.894
but I'd rather
have a prostate exam.

25:10.930 --> 25:12.196
There you go.

25:12.248 --> 25:13.530
See?
You're leaning in.

25:13.532 --> 25:14.632
I'm proud of you.

25:14.667 --> 25:15.733
Excuse me, ma'am,
could you make sure

25:15.768 --> 25:17.368
to cut him off
when he starts mumbling about

25:17.403 --> 25:20.104
how they don't make shows like
<i>Welcome Back Cotter</i> anymore?

25:20.139 --> 25:23.073
[upbeat music]

25:23.109 --> 25:25.509
♪ ♪

25:25.544 --> 25:26.784
What are you doing here,
Daniel?

25:26.812 --> 25:29.880
Just wondering what color
to paint the walls.

25:29.915 --> 25:32.249
I've never been partial to red.

25:32.285 --> 25:34.118
Instead of commenting
on my wall color,

25:34.153 --> 25:36.053
why don't you go back
to your office?

25:36.088 --> 25:37.721
Lick your wounds.

25:37.757 --> 25:40.157
What wounds?
I'm about to win.

25:40.192 --> 25:42.593
You have
a funny definition of win.

25:42.628 --> 25:45.646
Since we just blew your
best offer out of the water.

25:45.681 --> 25:46.930
Here's a copy of my new offer.

25:46.966 --> 25:48.365
It'll be
in "The Journal" tomorrow.

25:48.401 --> 25:51.602
There's no way the deal
holds up under this price.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.037
And once your client
figures that out,

25:53.039 --> 25:55.055
your offer falls through.

25:55.107 --> 25:58.142
Well, then lucky for me,
my client's Japanese

25:58.177 --> 26:01.345
and the dollar just
took a dive against the yen.

26:01.380 --> 26:03.180
So my deal will hold up
and then some.

26:03.215 --> 26:05.455
You know, I don't give a shit
where your client's from.

26:05.484 --> 26:06.950
I don't lose to you.

26:06.986 --> 26:08.986
Yes you do.

26:09.021 --> 26:11.155
Because after this deal,
there'll be another one

26:11.207 --> 26:15.159
and another one
and another one,

26:15.194 --> 26:17.161
because you took my firm from me
and I'm going to take it

26:17.196 --> 26:20.397
right back from you.

26:20.433 --> 26:22.800
Get the hell out of my office,
Daniel,

26:22.835 --> 26:25.169
before I do something
you'll regret.

26:25.204 --> 26:27.271
Speaking of walls,

26:27.306 --> 26:29.506
how does it feel
to have them closing in on you?

26:36.148 --> 26:38.716
Son of a bitch!

26:38.751 --> 26:42.870
Louis, is something wrong?

26:42.905 --> 26:44.455
See this?

26:44.507 --> 26:46.140
It contains everything
on God's green earth

26:46.192 --> 26:48.075
there is to know
about Jack Edward Soloff

26:48.110 --> 26:50.544
from his pirate beard
to his stupid pen

26:50.596 --> 26:52.563
that he carries around
like Linus's blanket.

26:52.598 --> 26:54.131
- And...?
- And there's no dirt on him!

26:54.166 --> 26:56.233
There's not one case
he crossed a line on.

26:56.285 --> 26:59.636
There's no debts.
Nothing.

26:59.672 --> 27:00.971
Louis.

27:01.006 --> 27:02.406
Did you hear me?
Is Soloff did something

27:02.441 --> 27:04.975
and Hardman's a part of it,
it is buried so deep,

27:05.010 --> 27:06.477
we'll never even
see the top of it,

27:06.512 --> 27:09.012
let alone get
to the bottom of it.

27:09.014 --> 27:10.714
Louis, I'm about to tell you
something I never

27:10.766 --> 27:12.950
thought I would.
What?

27:12.952 --> 27:14.868
The night that Harvey and Mike
put it together

27:14.920 --> 27:17.938
about Daniel and CM,

27:17.973 --> 27:20.190
they got stoned first.

27:20.226 --> 27:21.625
What?

27:21.660 --> 27:22.726
They thought you and Daniel
had them and they were screwed

27:22.762 --> 27:24.728
and they figured,
"What the hell?"

27:24.764 --> 27:27.197
So they bought some marijuana
and they got high.

27:27.233 --> 27:28.966
Are you suggesting
we take the pot?

27:29.001 --> 27:30.100
Worked for them.

27:30.136 --> 27:31.201
Well, it's not
gonna work for me.

27:31.237 --> 27:32.302
- Louis--
- Donna look at me.

27:32.338 --> 27:33.370
Do I look like someone
who needs to be hungry

27:33.406 --> 27:34.605
and paranoid?
Relax.

27:34.657 --> 27:35.706
It was just a suggestion.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.341
Well it was
a stupid god damn suggestion,

27:37.376 --> 27:39.510
and if that's all you have,
just walk you ass out of here.

27:39.545 --> 27:42.279
Louis, what is going on?
Why are you so angry at me?

27:42.314 --> 27:43.664
I'm not angry at you.

27:43.699 --> 27:46.183
I'm angry at myself.
Louis.

27:46.218 --> 27:47.818
After the vote,
Harvey told me it was my fault

27:47.820 --> 27:50.654
and you want to know what?
He's right.

27:50.689 --> 27:53.073
Harvey says a lot of things.

27:53.125 --> 27:55.459
- You told me too.
- What?

27:55.494 --> 27:57.494
This whole thing started
because I told Jack

27:57.530 --> 27:59.096
that he could
bring up Harvey's compensation

27:59.131 --> 28:01.698
for a vote,
and you told me not to.

28:01.734 --> 28:04.668
Well, then maybe
it's my fault too.

28:04.703 --> 28:06.703
Because this whole thing
really started when you tried

28:06.739 --> 28:10.691
to make things right with Harvey
for me coming to work for you.

28:10.743 --> 28:13.510
Donna, are you saying
that you regret coming to me?

28:13.546 --> 28:15.412
No, Louis.
I'm saying maybe

28:15.448 --> 28:18.081
I had a hand in this too.

28:18.117 --> 28:19.416
What do we do now?

28:19.452 --> 28:20.968
We keep looking together.

28:21.003 --> 28:24.288
And if we can't find anything,
then we tell Jessica the truth.

28:30.062 --> 28:32.830
- Hey.
- Laura, hi, how are you?

28:32.832 --> 28:34.164
Where's Rachel,
I thought for sure

28:34.200 --> 28:35.399
she'd beat me here.

28:35.434 --> 28:38.268
Uh, Rachel's not coming.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.537
I told her
I wasn't feeling well

28:40.539 --> 28:43.023
because I wanted
to talk to you alone.

28:43.058 --> 28:44.808
Is something wrong?

28:44.844 --> 28:46.026
Yes, there is.

28:46.078 --> 28:47.427
Rachel told me today that

28:47.463 --> 28:49.580
she wants to
scale back the wedding

28:49.615 --> 28:53.350
and that you two are
in sync on this.

28:53.385 --> 28:54.551
Sounds like
you don't believe her.

28:54.587 --> 28:55.786
Found it hard enough
to believe that she wouldn't

28:55.821 --> 28:57.521
want to put an announcement
in "The Times,"

28:57.556 --> 29:00.924
but that my little girl,
who always dreamed

29:00.960 --> 29:02.893
of getting married
at The Plaza Hotel

29:02.928 --> 29:05.662
now only wants
a handful of people there?

29:05.698 --> 29:07.631
I'm sorry, Michael.

29:07.683 --> 29:10.801
I just don't buy it.

29:10.836 --> 29:13.203
This is coming from you,
isn't it?

29:13.239 --> 29:16.273
You're right.

29:16.308 --> 29:18.492
It is.

29:18.544 --> 29:22.095
And I'll tell you why.

29:22.147 --> 29:26.016
I don't have a family.

29:26.051 --> 29:27.684
I don't have a lot of people
that I can invite,

29:27.686 --> 29:29.837
and I asked her
if we could please

29:29.889 --> 29:35.459
keep the entire wedding low-key.

29:35.494 --> 29:37.528
And she said that
she would do that for me.

29:37.563 --> 29:39.930
And I understand that.

29:39.982 --> 29:43.000
I think it's incredibly
sweet of her

29:43.035 --> 29:48.472
to be willing
to do that for you.

29:48.524 --> 29:52.342
But...

29:52.378 --> 29:54.745
If you could find it
in your heart

29:54.780 --> 29:56.747
to let my little girl
have the wedding

29:56.782 --> 30:00.150
that she's always wanted,
I am telling you,

30:00.185 --> 30:03.086
she'll remember it
for the rest of her life.

30:13.265 --> 30:15.065
Again?

30:15.100 --> 30:16.700
You know, I'd really prefer it
if I gave you a key

30:16.735 --> 30:18.702
so I wouldn't have to wonder
how you keep getting in.

30:18.737 --> 30:20.737
And I'd really prefer it
if you checked your cell phone

30:20.789 --> 30:21.905
every once in a while
so that I wouldn't

30:21.907 --> 30:23.240
have to keep doing this.

30:23.275 --> 30:24.775
- I have a cell phone?
- You do

30:24.810 --> 30:26.843
and if you'd check it,
you'd know that Daniel Hardman

30:26.879 --> 30:29.646
topped our bid by 20%.

30:29.682 --> 30:31.448
- That's impossible.
- No, it isn't.

30:31.483 --> 30:33.283
Because the dollar
took a dive against the yen

30:33.319 --> 30:35.802
and it turns out
his client is Japanese.

30:35.838 --> 30:36.954
God damn it,
we are not losing

30:36.989 --> 30:38.055
to that son of a bitch.

30:38.090 --> 30:39.389
Why the hell
did you think I'm here?

30:39.425 --> 30:40.991
We need to go back to
Gianopolous and get more money.

30:41.026 --> 30:42.109
Jessica, he's not going
to pay that much.

30:42.161 --> 30:43.493
No one in his right mind would.

30:43.545 --> 30:45.862
Then go to somebody
who's not in his right mind,

30:45.898 --> 30:48.265
because that lying bastard
isn't going to stop

30:48.300 --> 30:49.833
until his name is
back up on the wall.

30:49.868 --> 30:51.652
Wait a second,
the dollar took a dive

30:51.704 --> 30:54.621
against the yen two weeks ago.

30:54.657 --> 30:56.039
Which means there's something
else going on here.

30:56.075 --> 30:57.958
Oh, I'll tell you
what's going on.

30:57.993 --> 31:01.244
Hardman's been playing with us
this whole time.

31:01.297 --> 31:03.163
What are you saying?

31:03.215 --> 31:06.883
I'm saying I need to go
see a guy about a thing.

31:11.422 --> 31:12.573
Hey.

31:12.625 --> 31:14.641
Where were you?

31:14.693 --> 31:16.526
- I was with you mom.
- What?

31:16.562 --> 31:18.328
Didn't you get the message?
She had to postpone.

31:18.364 --> 31:21.231
She didn't postpone, Rachel.
She blindsided me.

31:21.267 --> 31:22.532
What are you talking about?

31:22.568 --> 31:23.867
Why didn't you tell me
you were fighting with her?

31:23.902 --> 31:25.102
Because mothers and daughters
fight about weddings

31:25.137 --> 31:26.336
all the time.

31:26.372 --> 31:27.304
But you weren't fighting
about the wedding.

31:27.339 --> 31:28.472
You were fighting
about my secret.

31:28.507 --> 31:29.706
And what does that
have to do with anything?

31:29.742 --> 31:30.807
<i>Because she doesn't</i>
<i>even know it.</i>

31:30.843 --> 31:32.292
Because I'm trying
to protect you.

31:32.328 --> 31:33.844
I understand that,
but you have to share

31:33.879 --> 31:35.279
these things with me.
<i>Why?</i>

31:35.314 --> 31:36.780
'Cause instead of
protecting me,

31:36.832 --> 31:38.282
you hung me out to dry.

31:38.317 --> 31:39.683
And how exactly did I do that?

31:39.718 --> 31:40.817
By making it seem like
I'm the one

31:40.869 --> 31:42.352
that's taking away
your dream wedding.

31:42.388 --> 31:47.641
You are the one
taking away my dream wedding.

31:47.693 --> 31:48.742
Rachel.

31:48.777 --> 31:49.860
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

31:49.862 --> 31:50.927
It's just, it's a lot,

31:50.980 --> 31:52.129
and she wanted
to make this announcement

31:52.164 --> 31:53.163
in "The New York Times"
and had this huge guest list

31:53.198 --> 31:57.267
and the Dean of Harvard Law
and I just--

31:57.303 --> 32:01.071
I don't want you
to get caught.

32:01.123 --> 32:02.205
You don't want me
to get caught

32:02.207 --> 32:04.558
or you don't want to marry me?

32:04.593 --> 32:06.143
What?

32:06.178 --> 32:08.812
I went to see Claire.

32:08.847 --> 32:11.882
I know she knows.

32:11.917 --> 32:12.983
And I want to know
if that made you

32:13.018 --> 32:17.154
have second thoughts about us.

32:17.206 --> 32:18.989
[sniffs]

32:19.024 --> 32:20.857
You went to see Claire?
Why...

32:20.909 --> 32:22.326
Why didn't you tell me that?

32:22.361 --> 32:23.927
Because she told me
that if I really loved you,

32:23.962 --> 32:26.897
I wouldn't marry you.

32:26.899 --> 32:28.098
And I was afraid
to tell you that

32:28.100 --> 32:32.135
because I thought
maybe you feel the same way.

32:32.171 --> 32:35.505
Well, it, um,

32:35.541 --> 32:39.476
it sounds like you're the one
who's having second thoughts.

32:39.511 --> 32:43.447
No.

32:43.449 --> 32:47.818
No, I'm not
having second thoughts,

32:47.853 --> 32:50.620
but I do hate the idea
that I am somehow dragging

32:50.656 --> 32:52.889
you into something
that is gonna ruin your life.

32:52.925 --> 32:53.990
You are not dragging me
into anything

32:54.026 --> 32:56.226
and you're not ruining my life,
Mike.

32:56.228 --> 33:00.030
I don't care about the plaza
or who comes or--

33:00.065 --> 33:01.148
I don't care about any of it.

33:01.183 --> 33:03.917
The only thing
that matters to me is that

33:03.969 --> 33:08.472
the man that
I'm marrying is you.

33:08.507 --> 33:11.575
And if you take that
away from me,

33:11.627 --> 33:13.877
I don't--
[cries]

33:13.879 --> 33:16.012
Rachel, Rachel, listen,
look at me, look at me.

33:16.048 --> 33:18.315
I'm not going anywhere.

33:18.350 --> 33:21.618
Okay?
We're getting married.

33:21.670 --> 33:23.720
And it could be
as small as possible

33:23.756 --> 33:26.990
with just our close friends,
okay?

33:26.992 --> 33:28.892
Okay?
Okay.

33:35.968 --> 33:37.517
I need to talk to you.

33:37.553 --> 33:39.236
What is it, Louis?

33:39.238 --> 33:40.838
I couldn't find
what Hardman has on Jack.

33:40.873 --> 33:42.172
That doesn't sound like
something you needed

33:42.207 --> 33:43.774
to be waiting by the elevators
to tell me.

33:43.809 --> 33:45.625
I've been thinking.
What if we tell him

33:45.661 --> 33:47.981
we'll only make him name partner
if he takes a public stand

33:48.013 --> 33:50.864
against Daniel first?
That way, even if he tries

33:50.899 --> 33:54.251

it won't work.

33:54.286 --> 33:55.552
Did you speak
to him about this?

33:55.587 --> 33:57.254
- I have.
- And?

33:57.256 --> 33:58.388
- He said
he'll be onboard.

33:58.424 --> 33:59.523
And Jessica,

33:59.575 --> 34:02.626
I believe him.

34:02.661 --> 34:04.961
- Then tell him to come see me
at the end of the day.

34:09.485 --> 34:10.833
- Hey.

34:14.172 --> 34:17.641
Turns out
I'm getting married.

34:17.676 --> 34:18.942
Yeah, I know.

34:21.079 --> 34:23.847
I was telling my future
mother-in-law

34:23.849 --> 34:27.199
about how I didn't
have any friends or any family

34:27.235 --> 34:31.004
when I realized,

34:31.039 --> 34:35.942
whatever happened between
you and me...

34:35.978 --> 34:38.945
you're the closest thing
to family that I have.

34:41.667 --> 34:43.967
So what do you say
we get together?

34:51.426 --> 34:55.929
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

34:55.981 --> 34:59.249
- I, uh...
I just want to say,

34:59.284 --> 35:01.184
based on what Louis said
that you're prepared to do--

35:01.220 --> 35:03.053
- Louis has no idea
what I'm prepared to do

35:03.088 --> 35:04.588
because the only thing
I'm prepared to do

35:04.623 --> 35:07.290
is give you a chance
to come to Jesus.

35:07.326 --> 35:08.909
And you're looking at her.

35:08.961 --> 35:10.677
- Come to Jesus about what?

35:10.712 --> 35:12.796
- Stop tap dancing, Jack.

35:12.831 --> 35:15.165
What the hell does
Daniel Hardman have on you?

35:15.200 --> 35:16.833
- You can ask me that question
a million times.

35:16.869 --> 35:18.768
I'm never even going
to acknowledge its premise.

35:18.804 --> 35:20.303
- And you just did.

35:20.339 --> 35:22.205
And if it's that bad,
and Daniel knows it

35:22.241 --> 35:24.107
and I don't,

35:24.142 --> 35:26.343
then I only have one choice.

35:26.378 --> 35:29.312
So, what I'm prepared
to do now is this.

35:29.348 --> 35:33.116
Resign tonight
and I'll waive your non-compete.

35:33.151 --> 35:35.018
- What?
- Oh, you didn't actually think

35:35.053 --> 35:38.088
I was going to make you
a name partner, did you?

35:42.494 --> 35:44.628
- Here's my counter.

35:44.663 --> 35:49.165
You resign,
and I waive your non-compete.

35:51.670 --> 35:54.437
- You want me gone,
call for a vote.

35:54.473 --> 35:56.273
- You want me gone,
you do the same thing

35:56.308 --> 35:58.074
because I'm a partner
as much as you

35:58.110 --> 35:59.860

on the ropes.

35:59.912 --> 36:01.344

with Daniel's investor

to put a stop to it right now.

36:09.855 --> 36:12.455

I shouldn't get married?

you should quit.

I'm going to do that.

- Michael, the longer you go,

40:25.977 --> 40:28.845
the less the money matters.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.114
The food doesn't taste as good.

40:31.149 --> 40:32.215
The car isn't fast enough.

40:32.217 --> 40:34.217
The view isn't high enough.

40:36.188 --> 40:37.687

40:56.658 --> 40:58.074
- You know who.
