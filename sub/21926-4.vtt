WEBVTT

01:03.146 --> 01:06.816
See, that's what happens when you take
an extra piece of bread for breakfast.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.276
Don't try that, Grace.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.461
That evening was so beautiful,
it made a pain in my heart.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.089
It's when you cannot tell
whether you're happy or sad.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.300
But I thought that if I could have a wish,

01:32.383 --> 01:35.595
it would be that nothing would ever change
and we would stay that way forever.

01:37.096 --> 01:39.057
Good morning, Dr. Jordan.

01:40.391 --> 01:41.518
Good morning, Grace.

01:51.152 --> 01:54.280
I am just reading
James McDermott's confession.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.200
He says, "Grace was very jealous

01:57.283 --> 02:01.079
of the difference made between her
and the housekeeper, whom she hated,

02:01.621 --> 02:04.290
and to whom she was
very insolent and saucy."

02:04.374 --> 02:05.500
He claims you said...

02:05.583 --> 02:07.293
What, is she better than us?

02:07.377 --> 02:10.547
That she is to be treated like a lady
and eat and drink the best?

02:11.172 --> 02:14.092
She is not better born than we are,
or better educated.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.852
This is a different story
than the one you told me.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.271
What do you think of
when you hear that, Grace?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.356
I've heard it before.

02:29.691 --> 02:34.070
It's bad luck to laugh at the dead.
The dead don't like being laughed at.

02:35.738 --> 02:38.658
Would you like me to continue on
where we left off yesterday, sir?

02:40.326 --> 02:42.036
Yes, please, Grace.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.791
Smell this.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.085
Isn't it lovely?

02:49.168 --> 02:53.214
And then I put on some hair pomade.
It gives the hair a wonderful shine.

02:53.923 --> 02:57.385
-Will you brush out my hair for me, Grace?
-Yes, with pleasure.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.896
That feels most luxurious.
You have a good touch, Grace.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.400
Your hair reminds me of my friend's hair.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.360
What friend is that?

03:15.069 --> 03:16.446
An old friend.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.992
We will need a chicken tonight.

03:21.701 --> 03:24.495
Captain Boyd and Colonel Bridgeford
are coming to dine.

03:24.579 --> 03:28.166
-Have McDermott kill one for us.
-Of course.

03:28.249 --> 03:31.544
Won't we need two chickens?
There will be six to dine with the ladies.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.797
There will be no ladies.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.841
The wives of these gentlemen
never condescend

03:36.925 --> 03:40.470
to darken the door of the house,
and I will not be taking dinner with them.

03:40.553 --> 03:44.349
They smoke and drink and talk of their
fine deeds in putting down the rebellion.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.393
Just do as I asked you.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.698
McDermott?

04:07.121 --> 04:08.248
McDermott?

04:09.499 --> 04:10.833
James?

04:15.546 --> 04:16.965
McDermott?

04:21.010 --> 04:24.639
Grace?
What are you doing in McDermott's loft?

04:24.722 --> 04:28.434
-We need him to kill a chicken.
-He's probably gone drinking in town.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.774
Can't find McDermott.

04:36.818 --> 04:40.321
He's always going off when he's needed.
You'll have to kill the chicken yourself.

04:41.072 --> 04:44.534
Oh, no. I can't do it.
I've never done it before.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.245
There's a first for everything.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.999
But I cannot shed
the blood of a living thing.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.334
Don't be a silly goose, Grace.
It's easy enough.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.920
Just take an axe
and whack it right through the neck.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.922
Nancy, I cannot bear the thought of it.

05:00.508 --> 05:04.053
Don't come back without a dead bird.
And hurry.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.597
Mr. Kinnear likes his meals on time.

05:10.852 --> 05:15.481
-What's the matter, Grace?
-Could you kill this chicken for me?

05:15.565 --> 05:17.525
There's nothing easier.
I would be glad to.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.906
You are so squeamish and tender-hearted.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.830
Thank you, Jamie.

05:32.206 --> 05:36.127
I don't have anything to give you for it,
but I will remember it in the future.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.880
I will help you any other time
you need it.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.513
That bird needs to go in the oven.

05:55.772 --> 05:59.358
-I see you've made a conquest.
-What do you mean?

05:59.442 --> 06:02.111
Jamie Walsh.
He has a bad case of puppy love.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.489
He used to be my admirer,
but now he's yours.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.866
He's not much of a catch.
He's only a boy.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.202
A worm will always turn.

06:09.285 --> 06:12.371
Will you go down to the cellar
and fetch another jug of wine?

06:12.455 --> 06:13.873
I don't like the spiders.

06:43.736 --> 06:47.031
And she was screaming, "My farm! My life!"

06:47.115 --> 06:50.535
And do you remember, Tom says,
"Your burning farm is not your problem.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.787
It is your disgusting rebel husband."

06:53.871 --> 06:55.623
I thought I could educate her.

06:55.706 --> 06:59.210
One can learn valuable lessons
at the most difficult times.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.671
Where did you find this one, Tom?

07:01.754 --> 07:05.383
Any more on the tree she came from?
And if so, are they ripe yet?

07:06.217 --> 07:07.927
What have you done with Nancy?

07:08.010 --> 07:10.805
Is she locked in a cupboard
with the rest of your Turkish harem?

07:11.848 --> 07:13.975
Look to your fine blue eyes, my dear.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.602
Nancy might scratch them out
if old Tom looks at you sideways.

07:16.686 --> 07:20.148
She's a fiery little rebel, that one.
Her last name is Montgomery.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.400
Just like the tavern
where the rebels gathered.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.194
Best be careful you don't fall
under her influence.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.370
At the time, Montgomery himself
was in the United States,

07:34.454 --> 07:37.832
having escaped from Kingston Penitentiary
in a most daring manner.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.588
So it is possible
for such a thing to be done.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.557
I don't think Captain Boyd
was a real Captain.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.893
Some men took up their titles

07:56.976 --> 07:59.896
just for having gotten their legs around
a horse on the day of the rebellion.

07:59.979 --> 08:03.357
-What about Mr. Kinnear?
-I don't know and I don't ask.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.902
But he would have been
on the side of the government.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.613
My best friend's family lost their farm
to the government troops.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.656
I don't know and I don't ask.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.289
I'm getting too fat.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.545
We must and should pray for divine grace.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.465
We should not be puffed up with vanity

08:27.548 --> 08:31.802
and think that our prayers
might have any effect.

08:31.886 --> 08:35.556
The first is the last
and the last is the first.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.893
There are many whited sepulchers
walking around in our midst.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.354
Fair on the outside but filled

08:41.437 --> 08:42.980
with rot and corruption within.

08:43.064 --> 08:46.484
We should guard against complacency
and should not let our lamps go out.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.237
Because no man knows
the day or the hour thereof.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.155
We must await in fear and trembling.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.200
And what did you think
of this sermon, Grace?

08:55.368 --> 08:59.413
I thought to myself, if you could not get
divine grace by praying for it,

08:59.497 --> 09:02.750
or any other way,
or ever know if you had it or not,

09:02.833 --> 09:05.836
you might as well forget about the matter
and go about your business.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.048
Because whether you were damned
or saved was no concern of yours.

09:09.549 --> 09:13.135
No use crying over spilt milk if you don't
know whether the milk is spilt or not.

09:13.719 --> 09:17.557
And if God alone knows,
then God alone can tidy it up.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.938
Thinking of such things makes me drowsy.

09:24.021 --> 09:27.358
We will be saved
by divine grace alone

09:27.441 --> 09:33.239
and no efforts on our part
or any good works that we might do.

09:33.322 --> 09:34.991
Divine grace...

09:35.074 --> 09:36.659
It's an outrage.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.077
An outrage.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.374
Let's go. I can't stand being stared at.

09:43.874 --> 09:48.212
I thought, these are cold
and proud people and not good neighbors.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.755
They are hypocrites.

09:49.839 --> 09:53.134
They think the church is a cage
to keep God in so he will

09:53.217 --> 09:56.971
not go wandering about during the week
poking his nose into their business.

09:57.054 --> 10:00.683
and looking into the depths and doubleness
of their hearts and lack of true charity.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.520
They believe they need only be bothered
about him on Sundays

10:04.604 --> 10:08.065
when they have their best clothes on
and their faces straight

10:08.149 --> 10:11.902
and their hands washed and their gloves on
and their stories all prepared.

10:12.945 --> 10:18.200
But God is everywhere
and cannot be caged in as men can.

10:26.417 --> 10:30.379
-Where were you yesterday?
-I finished my morning chores.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.590
It's none of your damn business
where I went.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.718
You have no right to vanish
just when you might be wanted most.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.179
How was I supposed to know?
I can't read the future.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.806
You will not spend much more of it
in this house.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.059
You shall leave at the end of the month.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.561
Now take care of the horse,
unless you consider

10:45.645 --> 10:47.521
such a thing beneath your royal highness.

10:59.367 --> 11:03.371
I'm just as glad. I do not like being
ordered about by a woman.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.290
And it's worse considering
what type of a woman she is.

11:06.374 --> 11:09.293
I don't care to stay a moment longer
with such a parcel of whores.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.671
What do you mean by that?

11:11.754 --> 11:14.048
Do you not know that Nancy
and Mr. Kinnear sleep together?

11:15.174 --> 11:18.052
It's no secret.
All the neighborhood knows of it.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.014
That cannot be true.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.976
You can scarcely see the nose
before your own face.

11:27.061 --> 11:30.106
Nancy had a baby when she was working
over the Wrights' farm

11:30.189 --> 11:32.483
by a young lay-about
who ran off and left her.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.985
The baby died thanks to midwife's mercy.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.947
Mr. Kinnear hired her
and took her in anyway,

11:38.030 --> 11:39.990
which no respectable man would have done.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.787
It was clear from the first
what he had in mind.

11:46.872 --> 11:51.502
Once the horse is out of the stable,
it's no good shutting the barn door.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.088
A turtle...

11:54.672 --> 11:57.716
A woman once on her back
is like a turtle in the same plight.

11:58.259 --> 12:03.305
She can scarcely turn herself right side
up again and then she's fair game for all.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.684
I don't believe you.

12:16.735 --> 12:20.072
Though I protested, it came to me
that for once he was telling the truth.

12:20.739 --> 12:24.285
And I was ashamed of myself for letting
myself be imposed on in that fashion.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.996
For being so blind and foolish.

12:38.299 --> 12:42.428
I'm sorry to say that after this I lost
much of the respect I'd felt for Nancy,

12:42.511 --> 12:44.305
as being older
and the mistress of the house.

12:44.388 --> 12:45.639
You've missed by the hutch.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.227
- Why don't you do it?
- Grace!

12:50.311 --> 12:53.272
Since nothing is ever good enough for you.
Do it yourself.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.691
Or can you not bend down
in that fine dress?

12:55.774 --> 12:57.610
-How dare you!
-How dare I what?

13:08.162 --> 13:10.498
Why is McDermott not helping you
with that, Grace?

13:10.581 --> 13:13.042
-It is too heavy for you.
-It is my task, sir.

13:13.125 --> 13:17.087
-Here, I'll carry it up for you.
-Oh no, sir. I cannot allow it.

13:18.005 --> 13:22.051
'Tis up to me what will be allowed or not.
I am master of the house, am I not?

13:23.260 --> 13:24.512
Yes.

13:24.595 --> 13:28.015
Come then, Grace.
I will take it upstairs for you.

13:49.495 --> 13:53.916
Nancy plans to turn me away before
the month is up and to withhold my wages.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.753
If she treats me this way,
she'll treat you the same.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.173
We need to join together
and demand our rights.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.262
I hate all Englishmen.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.847
-Mr. Kinnear is a Lowland Scot.
-It's the same thing.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.934
They're all thieves, whores,
stealers of land.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.978
They grind down the poor wherever they go.

14:14.478 --> 14:18.732
They deserve to be knocked on the head
and thrown down a cellar, both of them.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.026
And I'm the man for the job.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.781
I thought this was just a way of talking,

14:25.865 --> 14:28.117
as he was always a boaster.

14:28.993 --> 14:33.122
My own father when drunk threatened me
this way but had never in fact done so.

14:34.665 --> 14:38.335
The best thing at such times was just to
nod and agree and take no further notice.

14:38.419 --> 14:41.297
-So you did not believe him, at first?
-Not at all.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.091
Nor would you, sir, if you yourself
had been listening.

14:44.174 --> 14:46.635
I took it all for idle threats.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.555
Before he was hanged, McDermott
said that you put him up to it.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.058
He claimed that you intended to murder
Nancy and Mr. Kinnear

14:53.142 --> 14:57.438
by putting poison in their porridge and
that he repeatedly refused to help you.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.773
-You're such a coward.
-I will not be part of it.

14:59.857 --> 15:03.027
-You'll go straight to hell.
-It's the simplest thing in the world.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.195
We needn't even get any blood
on our hands.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.367
Who told you such a lie?

15:10.451 --> 15:12.745
It's written in McDermott's confession.

15:13.746 --> 15:17.583
Just because a thing has been written
down, sir, does not mean it's God's truth.

15:17.666 --> 15:23.213
You are quite right about that, Grace.
But all the same, what do you say to it?

15:23.297 --> 15:26.050
Well, sir, it's one of the silliest things
I've ever heard.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.468
Why do you say that?

15:28.385 --> 15:30.930
If I wanted to put poison
into a bowl of porridge, sir,

15:31.013 --> 15:33.307
why would I have needed help
from the likes of him?

15:33.390 --> 15:37.269
I could have done it myself, put some into
his own porridge too, into the bargain.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.606
It would not take any more strength
than to add another spoonful of sugar.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.066
You are very cool about it, Grace.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.986
Why would he say that about you,
if it was false?

15:47.446 --> 15:49.782
Perhaps he wanted to shift the blame.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.536
And I suppose he wanted me
to keep him company.

15:55.704 --> 16:00.459
The road to death is a lonely highway,
and longer than it appears,

16:00.542 --> 16:04.463
even when it leads straight down
from the scaffold by way of a rope.

16:05.547 --> 16:10.511
And it's a dark road, with never any moon
shining on it to light your way.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.641
You know a good deal about it,
for one that's never been there.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.979
I too was condemned to be hanged
and thought I would be.

16:20.771 --> 16:24.024
When you go the same road,
you must take your bearings of it.

16:25.734 --> 16:26.944
True enough.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.446
Nor do I blame poor James McDermott.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.615
Not for such a wish.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.828
I would never blame a human creature
for feeling lonely.

16:39.623 --> 16:42.084
Have you often felt lonely, Grace?

16:43.627 --> 16:44.837
Yes.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.048
In the asylum.

16:49.925 --> 16:53.721
And in the penitentiary, when there are
punishments for things especially.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.307
What sort of punishments?

17:25.377 --> 17:28.047
Please! Please!

17:28.672 --> 17:29.631
Help!

17:33.135 --> 17:37.014
And in the asylum, the doctors and the
orderlies themselves often took liberties.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.062
These things made me feel like
I was alone in the world.

17:45.731 --> 17:49.443
Is it true that you were in a delicate
condition when you left the asylum?

17:54.823 --> 17:57.201
That is what they told me, sir.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.623
That must have been
very difficult for you.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.882
-Could we change the subject please, sir?
-Of course.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.723
Did you feel lonely at the Kinnear farm?

18:21.975 --> 18:25.896
I remember one day in particular.
It was my birthday.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.820
Happy birthday, Grace.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.447
For your room.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.826
-Thank you, Nancy.
-You may have the afternoon free.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.497
Thank you. But I wouldn't know
what to do with myself.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.291
I'll stay home
and finish polishing the silver.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.419
Nonsense. You should go for a walk
in the country around.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.547
You may borrow my hat.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.432
Mr. Kinnear intends to be home
all afternoon.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.352
She wants you out of the way.

19:06.770 --> 19:11.024
Careful.
There are many vagabonds out on the roads.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.152
A girl as flighty as you needs protection.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.696
I'll be just fine, thank you.

19:45.475 --> 19:48.020
There's something depressing
to the spirits about a birthday,

19:48.103 --> 19:49.938
especially when alone.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.483
I had no idea in my mind
of where I should go.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.612
And it struck me at once
how very solitary I was.

19:56.695 --> 20:00.282
I had no friends and if you looked
at things in the cold light of day,

20:00.365 --> 20:02.117
I was indeed alone in the world,

20:02.201 --> 20:05.579
with no prospects before me
except the drudgery I'd been doing.

20:06.246 --> 20:08.332
And although I could find
a different situation,

20:08.415 --> 20:11.084
it would be the same sort of work,
from dawn to dusk,

20:11.168 --> 20:13.170
with always a mistress ordering me about.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.300
I reflected that the very birds
were strangers to me,

20:18.383 --> 20:20.761
for I did not even know their names.

20:20.844 --> 20:24.973
And for some reason,
that seemed to me the saddest of all.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.456
Oh, Jamie. You startled me.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.001
Happy Birthday.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.923
I saw you crying.
Why are you sad, Grace?

20:59.132 --> 21:01.718
-I have no friends here.
-I'm your friend.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.347
-Do you have a sweetheart, Grace?
-I do not.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.183
I would like to be your sweetheart,
and when I'm older

21:08.267 --> 21:10.519
and have saved money for it,
we will be married.

21:11.436 --> 21:14.481
-Jamie, I'm a great deal older than you.
-A year and a bit.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.819
Jamie, I don't know why,
but a girl of 15 or 16

21:18.902 --> 21:22.572
is accounted a woman,
a boy of the same age is still a boy.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.077
Thank you for your offer.
I'll consider it.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.748
Here. I'll make you a daisy crown.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.619
You are the May Queen.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.748
I'll have to be the July Queen
as it is July.

22:12.831 --> 22:16.293
-May I give you a kiss on the cheek?
-Yes, but only one.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.756
Thank you, Jamie.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.924
You've made my birthday a fine occasion
after all.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.512
I should be going home.
My father will be wondering where I am.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.990
Good afternoon, Grace.

22:48.909 --> 22:51.161
Who was that man you were
with in the orchard?

22:52.204 --> 22:55.040
-What were you doing with him?
-It was only young Jamie Walsh.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.959
We were making daisy chains
because it is my birthday.

23:17.687 --> 23:21.066
What's that wilted flower in your hair?
It looks very silly.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.827
So, you were rolling about the grass
with the errand boy.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.371
He should have his brains
knocked out for that.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.999
I'd do it myself if he wasn't such a baby.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.918
Such a fine cradle-robber you are.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.713
I was doing no such thing.

24:24.796 --> 24:27.507
I felt as though the afternoon
had not been mine at all,

24:27.591 --> 24:32.053
and not a kind and private thing, but had
been spied upon by every one of them.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.265
Exactly as if they'd all been
at the door of my bed chamber

24:35.891 --> 24:37.767
and taking turns looking
through the keyhole.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.895
How did that make you feel, Grace?

24:40.729 --> 24:42.480
It made me feel very sad.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.026
And also angry.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.339
Jeremiah.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.639
Well, Grace, I told you I would come.

25:15.722 --> 25:18.475
-I'm glad to see you, Jeremiah!
-Aren't you going to invite me in?

25:22.229 --> 25:23.980
Here's to your good health, Grace.

25:26.983 --> 25:29.736
I wanted to celebrate the end of my life
as a peddler with you.

25:29.819 --> 25:32.239
-Are you no longer a peddler?
-Not after today.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.491
I am going to be a hypnotist.

25:35.533 --> 25:37.786
There's a real appetite for it,
now more than ever.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.788
Thank you for coming.

25:42.832 --> 25:44.334
Are you happy here?

25:45.585 --> 25:48.880
-The house is a beautiful one.
-But a quiet and removed situation.

25:49.839 --> 25:50.966
It is quiet.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.134
But Mr. Kinnear is a liberal gentleman.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.761
With a gentleman's tastes.

25:57.514 --> 26:00.892
They say in the neighborhood
he has a hankering for servant girls.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.437
I pray you do not end up
like Mary Whitney.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.357
It is a sad story what happened to Mary.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.318
But for you, Grace,
a stitch in time saves nine.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.989
You know that Nancy was the servant
of this household not so long ago

26:14.072 --> 26:16.408
doing the rough and dirty work
that you do now.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.618
I did not know that.

26:21.788 --> 26:26.126
When a man gets a habit,
it is hard for him to break it.

26:26.209 --> 26:28.044
Like a dog gone bad.

26:29.087 --> 26:32.882
Once a sheep is killed and the dog
gets a taste for it, it must kill another.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.551
Don't like this talk of killing.

26:38.346 --> 26:42.225
Come away with me, Grace.
I do not like the feeling here.

26:42.684 --> 26:46.021
Come away? What do you mean?

26:46.104 --> 26:48.440
-You would be safer with me.
-Where would we go?

26:48.523 --> 26:52.068
-We could go to the United States.
-What's it like there?

26:52.152 --> 26:54.404
Well, in many ways it's the same as here.

26:54.487 --> 26:56.573
There are rogues and scoundrels
everywhere.

26:56.656 --> 26:59.326
They merely use a different sort
of language to excuse themselves.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.911
There they pay great lip service
to democracy,

27:02.454 --> 27:06.833
just as here they rant on about the right
order of society and loyalty to the queen.

27:06.916 --> 27:10.128
And yet the poor are poor on every shore.

27:10.211 --> 27:13.340
But when you cross that border,
it's like passing through air.

27:13.423 --> 27:17.010
The trees are the same on either side
and we can go through those very trees

27:17.093 --> 27:19.512
-and not pay customs duties.
-Wouldn't we be breaking the law?

27:19.596 --> 27:22.974
Aren't laws made to be broken?
These laws were not made by me or mine,

27:23.058 --> 27:25.977
they were made by the powers that be
so that they could profit.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.104
-We would be harming no one.
-What would I do?

27:28.188 --> 27:31.983
Travel with me.
You could be a medical clairvoyant.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.944
I could help you into trances
and instruct you.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.489
I know by your hand
you have a talent for it.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.291
Yeah. You have the right look for it.

27:48.750 --> 27:52.295
And you could earn twice as much in
one day than you do here in two months.

27:52.379 --> 27:59.052
Of course, you would need a new name,
a French one perhaps, something foreign.

27:59.135 --> 28:02.472
People on this side of the ocean
would have a hard time believing that a
girl

28:02.555 --> 28:04.557
with a simple name like Grace
had mysterious powers.

28:06.476 --> 28:09.729
-Wouldn't that be a deception and a cheat?
-No more than the theater.

28:09.813 --> 28:14.275
If people wish to believe a thing, if they
long for it and depend on it to be true,

28:14.359 --> 28:16.861
is it cheating to help them
to their own belief?

28:16.945 --> 28:18.863
Or is it not rather a charity...

28:21.282 --> 28:22.826
a human kindness?

28:25.745 --> 28:28.415
A new name would pose no problem for me.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.918
I have no attachment to my own
as it was my father's.

28:33.711 --> 28:35.255
Shall we shake on it, then?

28:37.590 --> 28:40.260
I won't conceal from you, sir,
that the idea was greatly tempting.

28:41.302 --> 28:45.807
Jeremiah was a handsome man, and I was
to marry a man with a "J" to his name.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.980
And I thought also of the money I might
have and the clothes I could buy with it,

28:52.063 --> 28:54.023
and perhaps some good earrings as well.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.280
But then I had remembered
what had happened to Mary Whitney.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.451
Would we be married, then?

29:08.288 --> 29:09.706
What would be the need?

29:09.789 --> 29:13.126
Marriage never brought anything good,
as far as I see.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.712
If two are of a mind to keep together,
then they will,

29:15.795 --> 29:19.174
and if not, one will run off
and that's the long and short of it.

29:21.509 --> 29:23.136
I had better stay here, then.

29:25.346 --> 29:28.224
-In any case, I'm too young to be married.
-Please consider it, Grace.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.770
I'm willing to help you and care for you.

29:31.853 --> 29:35.482
And I tell you truly you are surrounded
by dangers here.

29:41.738 --> 29:44.908
Who the devil might you be?
What is he doing in the kitchen, Grace?

29:44.991 --> 29:47.535
-He's a peddler well known to me.
-Mr. Kinnear will be annoyed

29:47.619 --> 29:51.164
that you have been wasting good beer and
cheese on a common rogue of a peddler.

29:51.247 --> 29:54.334
Mr. Kinnear would not refuse an honest man
a cold drink on a hot day.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.377
I should be leaving.

30:11.309 --> 30:15.730
I will come back soon for your answer,
and I hope for your sake

30:15.814 --> 30:18.191
as well as my own that it will be yes.

30:18.274 --> 30:20.026
Thank you for coming, Jeremiah.

30:27.158 --> 30:29.118
He has a low, foreign look about him.

30:30.036 --> 30:32.872
I suppose he came sniffing about you
like a bitch in heat.

30:32.956 --> 30:36.167
Kindly remove yourself
so I can get on with the supper.

30:55.311 --> 30:57.564
Several days later
the doctor paid us a visit.

31:02.610 --> 31:04.362
Doctors are like crows.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.781
When you see two or three of them,

31:06.865 --> 31:09.617
you know there's a death in the offing
and they're discussing it.

31:11.119 --> 31:14.247
With the crows, they're deciding which
parts to tear open and make off with,

31:14.330 --> 31:16.624
and so it is with the doctors.

31:21.921 --> 31:25.717
I do not mean you, sir,
as you have no leather bag or knives.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.975
Well, Grace.
And where is your mistress?

31:34.058 --> 31:36.269
She's not at all well.
She is lying down upstairs.

31:36.352 --> 31:38.813
But if there's anything to be brought,
I can do it myself.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.649
-I should like coffee if it's no trouble.
-It's no trouble.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.902
Though I have to build the fire again.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.696
When it is ready, bring it in to me.
Thank you, Grace.

32:02.837 --> 32:04.923
-Are you feeling all right?
-Yes.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.011
What are you doing stirring up the fire?

32:10.094 --> 32:12.764
Mr. Kinnear wants me to make coffee
and take it into him.

32:12.847 --> 32:15.934
But I always take in his coffee.
Why did he ask you?

32:17.352 --> 32:19.187
Because you yourself were not here.

32:19.270 --> 32:22.148
I was sparing you the work
as you said you were feeling ill.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.692
I'll take it in.

32:25.818 --> 32:31.282
And, Grace, this afternoon
I would like you to scrub this floor.

32:31.366 --> 32:35.286
It's very dirty
and I'm tired of living in a pigpen.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.382
Clean it up.

33:18.746 --> 33:22.083
Don't walk on my clean floor
with your mucky boots.

33:28.089 --> 33:31.426
Don't you have anything better to do?
You're not paid to stand there and gawp--

33:33.011 --> 33:35.430
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.266
-There's no harm done.
-What is it?

33:38.683 --> 33:39.976
What are you doing here?

33:40.059 --> 33:42.145
Scrubbing the floor, ma'am.
As you ordered me to.

33:42.228 --> 33:44.147
You're talking back.
I am sick of your insolence.

33:44.230 --> 33:47.817
-All I wanted was a second cup of coffee.
-I'll make it. Grace, you can go.

33:47.900 --> 33:50.319
Where am I to go, ma'am,
with the floor only half done?

33:50.403 --> 33:52.905
Anywhere out of here.
And for God's sake, pin up your hair.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.907
You look like a common slut.

33:54.991 --> 33:56.659
I will be in the library.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.536
Close your mouth.
You'll catch flies.

34:00.079 --> 34:03.416
Go get cleaned up.
I need you to help me with a new dress.

34:03.499 --> 34:05.001
None of my old ones fit anymore.

34:06.252 --> 34:09.047
All at once it came over me
what was the matter with her.

34:09.130 --> 34:11.924
I'd seen it before. She was in trouble.

34:12.008 --> 34:13.301
Stop staring at me.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.970
I felt my heart going hard like a hammer.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.641
It cannot be.

34:20.725 --> 34:24.771
-Mr. Kinnear know she was pregnant?
-I could tell he did not know.

34:24.854 --> 34:27.482
And I wondered what he would do
when he found out.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.735
Boot her into a ditch. Marry her.
I had no idea.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.612
What did you hope for?

34:34.238 --> 34:36.866
I could not rest easy
with either of those futures.

34:37.867 --> 34:40.411
I wished Nancy no harm,
but it would not be fair

34:40.495 --> 34:43.706
for her to end up a respectable
married lady with a ring on her finger.

34:43.790 --> 34:47.919
-It would not be right at all.
-Why? Why would that not be right, Grace?

34:49.337 --> 34:52.340
Because Mary had done the same as her
and gone to her death.

34:53.508 --> 34:57.095
Why should one be rewarded and
the other punished for the same sin?

35:14.904 --> 35:18.241
When the weather is like that,
you can hear your own heart beat.

35:18.324 --> 35:21.911
It is like hiding and waiting for someone
to come and find you,

35:21.994 --> 35:24.122
and you don't know
who that person will be.

35:29.335 --> 35:31.462
Why can't we have proper cooked food,

35:31.546 --> 35:33.798
like the steak and peas
they're eating in there?

35:35.383 --> 35:38.094
New peas do not grow on trees.

35:38.177 --> 35:40.555
You ought to know who would have
first choice of them.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.683
In any case I'm Mr. Kinnear's servant,
not yours.

35:43.766 --> 35:47.812
If you were mine, you would not last long.
You are such a foul-tempered witch.

35:48.229 --> 35:52.191
-The cure for you is the end of a belt.
-Ill words butter no parsnips.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.252
Stop it.

36:14.297 --> 36:17.341
Has the cat got your tongue?
Why are you so pensive tonight?

36:17.425 --> 36:18.968
I am worried about the servants.

36:19.051 --> 36:21.053
- Which of the servants?
- Both of them.

36:21.137 --> 36:24.307
Well, of course, there are
three servants in the house, not two.

36:24.390 --> 36:27.602
-You are a servant yourself.
-That's very kind of you to remind me.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.353
Now I must go.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.939
I have my duties in the kitchen
to attend to.

36:32.023 --> 36:35.443
You must stay where you are.
It is your master's command.

36:36.652 --> 36:38.988
I suppose that is what I am paid for.

36:39.071 --> 36:41.407
Oh, shh.

36:41.490 --> 36:44.827
Why are you worrying about the servants?
Is the work not getting done?

36:44.911 --> 36:47.330
The work is getting done,
but in McDermott's case,

36:47.413 --> 36:49.540
only because I stand over him with a whip.

36:50.166 --> 36:52.376
He's insolent.
I've given him his notice.

36:52.460 --> 36:55.463
I've never liked him. What about Grace?

36:55.546 --> 37:01.719
Grace is quick and tidy about her work,
but lately she's become very quarrelsome.

37:01.802 --> 37:04.180
I'm thinking of giving her
her notice as well.

37:04.263 --> 37:08.434
There's something about her
that makes me quite uneasy.

37:08.517 --> 37:09.977
I think she's not quite right.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.897
Several times I've heard her
talking out loud to herself.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.400
She's certainly a handsome girl.

37:17.610 --> 37:22.114
She has a naturally refined air,
a pure Grecian profile.

37:22.198 --> 37:25.952
If I put her in the right clothes
and told her to hold her head high

37:26.035 --> 37:29.538
and keep her mouth shut,
I could pass her off as a lady any day.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.958
I certainly hope you never
say such things to her.

37:32.041 --> 37:35.503
It would give her ideas above her station.
It would be no favor to her.

37:35.586 --> 37:38.005
You have never had
such agreeable opinions of me.

37:38.881 --> 37:41.842
I have opinions of you,
you're absolutely filthy.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.261
Now, you, you, you.

37:43.344 --> 37:47.348
You... Come back here, you dirty girl.
You do as I say.

37:47.431 --> 37:48.391
No.

37:48.474 --> 37:52.103
Or I will have to catch you,
and when I do, I will have you.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.997
The rain was loud and oppressive.

38:12.039 --> 38:15.251
And I heard a whisper as close
as if it were inside my ear.

38:16.043 --> 38:17.837
It cannot be.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.967
Whisper.

38:23.592 --> 38:25.052
That whisper.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.473
That whisper...

38:29.557 --> 38:30.891
And then...

38:33.352 --> 38:35.771
Then I had a very strange dream.

40:32.888 --> 40:35.683
I saw headless angels in bloody robes.

40:37.059 --> 40:40.146
They were sitting in silent judgement
upon Mr. Kinnear's house,

40:41.522 --> 40:43.232
and on all within it.

41:13.429 --> 41:16.807
The sheets I'd hung the night before
had blown into the trees.

41:16.891 --> 41:20.728
It was very unlike me to forget
a white laundry I'd worked so hard at.

41:21.228 --> 41:24.899
The nightdresses and shirts did indeed
look like angels without heads.

41:26.066 --> 41:29.320
It was as if our own clothing
was sitting in judgement upon us.

41:30.696 --> 41:33.866
And I could not shake the feeling that
there was some doom on the house,

41:33.949 --> 41:36.243
and that some within were fated to die.

41:40.372 --> 41:43.834
If I was given the chance right then,
I would have run off with Jeremiah,

41:43.918 --> 41:45.961
and better for me if I had.

41:46.962 --> 41:48.964
But I did not know where he had gone.

41:49.798 --> 41:54.720
I did know that I was walking around
outside in the night without knowing it.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.599
And my heart sank at this.

42:07.274 --> 42:11.070
I remember looking up at you
after I told this story, Dr. Jordan.

42:12.446 --> 42:14.406
And I remember that it did
my heart good

42:14.490 --> 42:17.409
to feel I could bring some pleasure
into a fellow being's life.

42:34.134 --> 42:38.722
And I thought to myself,
I wonder what you will make of all that?
