00:36.625 --> 00:38.750
<i>But now,
put on your thinking caps.</i>

00:38.750 --> 00:41.166
<i>It's America's new favorite game show.</i>

00:42.416 --> 00:45.958
<i>It’s seven o’clock on a weeknight,
which can only mean one thing.</i>

00:46.208 --> 00:47.500
<i>It’s time for...</i>

00:47.500 --> 00:49.750
<i>- Can’t Stop the Quiz!</i>
-  <i>Can’t Stop the Quiz!</i>

00:50.625 --> 00:52.791
<i>I’m your host, Terry McTeer.</i>

00:53.291 --> 00:55.416
Oh, my God!

00:55.416 --> 00:57.875
You made out with David Zelman?

00:58.500 --> 01:00.208
You lost 600 dollars?

01:05.375 --> 01:06.625
I want a divorce!

01:08.583 --> 01:11.541
-  <i>Welcome. Best of luck.</i>

01:11.875 --> 01:14.791
<i>May I have
five minutes on the clock, please?</i>

01:17.625 --> 01:21.000
<i>And your time starts now!</i>

01:21.000 --> 01:22.083
<i>Welcome!</i>

01:22.083 --> 01:23.666
<i>-Ready to learn and have some fun?</i>

01:23.791 --> 01:25.625
<i>- Countries on the equator. Whoa!</i>

01:26.000 --> 01:28.041
<i>Correct! Correct!
Wow! You guys are smart.</i>

01:28.375 --> 01:30.666
<i>Welcome, Ralph,
hope you're enjoying Los Angeles.</i>

01:30.666 --> 01:33.208
<i>Do me a favor,
don't miss the La Brea Tar Pits.</i>

01:33.416 --> 01:34.541
<i>They're lovely.</i>

01:34.666 --> 01:37.083
Your cousin, Jin,
just got into Harvard Medical School!

01:37.083 --> 01:38.416
And you’re dropping out?

01:38.416 --> 01:40.708
It’s bad enough
you go to community college!

01:40.708 --> 01:43.791
I don’t need school!
I’m gonna be an actress.

01:43.791 --> 01:45.458
Oh! You’re making me crazy.

01:45.458 --> 01:48.833
- I’m going to the casino.
-  Have fun losing all our money!

01:49.041 --> 01:51.416
<i>That was incredible!
You almost knocked my bow tie off.</i>

01:51.541 --> 01:54.083
<i>- I would've felt quite nude.</i>

01:54.416 --> 01:55.500
<i>Don’t go anywhere.</i>

01:55.666 --> 01:56.916
<i>- I know I won’t.</i>
- I know I won’t.

01:58.750 --> 01:59.958
<i>What an incredible game!</i>

01:59.958 --> 02:04.375
<i>I learned so much.
I had no idea pineapple is a berry.</i>

02:04.875 --> 02:05.916
<i>That blows my mind.</i>

02:06.500 --> 02:10.625
<i>Join us tomorrow for another night
of fast facts and live learning!</i>

02:11.000 --> 02:14.791
<i>I’m Terry McTeer and I’ll be right here.</i>

02:14.916 --> 02:16.625
<i>- Have a good night!</i>

02:17.458 --> 02:20.041
<i>Thank you so much.
Have a great trip back to Delaware.</i>

02:20.375 --> 02:22.125

03:08.000 --> 03:09.125
Oh, we love you.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.250
Happy hour after this. Happy hour.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.375
- Yes!
- Yeah.

03:13.875 --> 03:15.833
 Okay, let's get inside, get inside.

03:16.125 --> 03:18.375
Anne? Anne, is that you?

03:18.500 --> 03:19.708
Get inside.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.833
Anne, your stupid postman
has done it again.

03:23.333 --> 03:27.416
Once again, he's left one of your packages
in front of my door.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.416
Oh, man. Uh, my mistake.

03:29.666 --> 03:31.083
- Yeah, well, what happens

03:31.083 --> 03:33.541
when there's an unexpected package
in front of my door?

03:34.000 --> 03:38.083
- I, um--
- I trip over it and I fall and I die.

03:38.458 --> 03:41.125
- Mm-hmm.
- Your stupid postman is trying to kill me.

03:41.833 --> 03:42.916
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

03:43.041 --> 03:44.041
Please speak to him.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.541
I'll leave him a voice mail.
Thank you.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.791
Look, Linguini, it finally came.

04:03.416 --> 04:04.416
Linguini!

04:05.541 --> 04:06.791
<i>It’s time for...</i>

04:06.791 --> 04:09.000
<i>- Can’t Stop the Quiz!</i>
-  <i>Can’t Stop the Quiz!</i>

04:09.125 --> 04:13.416
<i>I’m your host, Terry McTeer.
Let’s meet tonight’s contestants!</i>

04:13.583 --> 04:16.666
<i>Starting with Linda,
who came all the way from Idaho.</i>

04:17.083 --> 04:19.000
<i>- Did you bring any potatoes?
- Uh...</i>

04:19.666 --> 04:21.791
<i>- I'm just kidding.</i>

04:21.958 --> 04:23.916
<i>And then we have
our returning champion,</i>

04:24.375 --> 04:26.958
- Ron Heacock from Ohio.

04:26.958 --> 04:29.333
 Ron, you must be getting
pretty comfortable here.

04:29.333 --> 04:32.291
You're now the third
longest-running champion.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.958
Congratulations!
That's quite an achievement.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.375
Uh, honestly,
I’m just glad to be here, Terry.

04:36.375 --> 04:38.625
- Uh, I’m a huge fan.
-  Oh!

04:38.750 --> 04:40.041
 Aw!

04:40.166 --> 04:42.000
- Please let this be the night...
-  <i>Last but not least,</i>

04:42.000 --> 04:43.875
<i>- we have Adrian.</i>
- ...he finally loses.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.916
Ron, your winning streak continues!

04:46.083 --> 04:49.208
 Thank you.
But Linda, you did so great tonight.

04:49.333 --> 04:50.833
<i>I... I wish we could both win.</i>

04:50.958 --> 04:54.208
Hey! How about it, Terry?
Can there be two winners?

04:55.625 --> 04:57.208
Unfortunately, no, there can't be.

04:57.375 --> 04:58.750
Oh. Just me then.

05:00.541 --> 05:02.416
All I'm saying...
Okay, you put the money into the computer.

05:02.416 --> 05:03.666
It prints you the money back.

05:03.666 --> 05:05.791
- You don't lose any money.
- If you want me to invest in an app...

05:06.000 --> 05:07.083
- ...I'm not gonna...

05:07.083 --> 05:09.125
I sent this in an email.
Did you not read the email?

05:09.250 --> 05:11.500
-  I don't open those things.
-  You don't open my emails?

05:11.500 --> 05:13.041
-  Any emails, ever.
- Hi, Mom.

05:13.041 --> 05:15.000
<i>Hi!
This is Shannon from Sunnyvale.</i>

05:15.541 --> 05:17.125
I have some bad news.

05:17.291 --> 05:19.125
- We lost your mom.

05:19.875 --> 05:20.958
What?

05:21.333 --> 05:22.916
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

05:23.041 --> 05:27.666
Sorry, that was terrible phrasing.
I meant we don't know where she is.

05:27.833 --> 05:31.291
- Yes, she's not dead, but she is missing.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.000
Have you checked Rivers Casino?

05:34.333 --> 05:38.375
<i>- Penny Palace, House of Slots?</i>
- Yes, we checked all her usual spots.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.750
<i>- Can you come in?</i>
-  I mean...

05:41.458 --> 05:43.208
-  Here she is.

05:44.916 --> 05:49.166
Uh. Ms. Yum,
thank you so much for coming in.

05:49.541 --> 05:51.541
Well, would you like to wait
for your sister?

05:51.708 --> 05:53.375
She’ll be here momentarily.

05:53.833 --> 05:55.958
My sister? You... you called Jenny?

05:56.458 --> 05:59.458
Well, when we lose someone,
we have to call everybody.

05:59.583 --> 06:02.208
- We didn’t lose her, she ran away.
- Oh! Right.

06:02.541 --> 06:04.916
It's okay. She does this sometimes.

06:04.916 --> 06:08.625
Due to the sheer number
of rules violations,

06:08.833 --> 06:11.625
we can no longer
keep your mother as a resident.

06:12.541 --> 06:14.125
So, you're kicking her out?

06:14.250 --> 06:16.458
- Enough is enough.
- It's enough.

06:16.666 --> 06:17.875
Ms. Yum,

06:17.875 --> 06:20.541
in signing the resident agreement,

06:20.958 --> 06:24.375
- she agreed to adhere to our policies.

06:24.875 --> 06:27.916
Sneaking out
is a very serious violation.

06:28.416 --> 06:31.583
- We can't be responsible for her safety.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.958
She’s also really mean.
It's less important, but it’s not nothing.

06:35.958 --> 06:40.083
- Uh. I think your sister's here.

06:43.208 --> 06:46.083
-  Hello! Annie! Annie, let me in!
-  The button! Push the button!

06:46.083 --> 06:48.291
- Hit the button. There's a button there.
-  Annie! I can't hear you!

06:48.291 --> 06:49.458
- Hit the god--
-  What?

06:49.625 --> 06:51.333
-  There's a... there's a button there.
- I can't see it!

06:51.333 --> 06:53.583
-  There's a...
- What button? What button?

06:57.041 --> 06:59.291
- Well, that wasn't very clear.
- Oh, well...

06:59.416 --> 07:01.791
Annie! Annie,
it's finally happened.

07:01.791 --> 07:03.375
- Oh, my God, it's okay, it's okay.
-  No, no...

07:03.375 --> 07:06.833
I'm here. I'm here, we're together.
We're gonna get through this.

07:06.833 --> 07:09.625
- This is a part of life.
- Jenny, what are you wearing?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.750
Oh, it's the only black dress I own.

07:13.250 --> 07:16.500
- Okay.
- I can't believe she's gone.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.083
- Mm-mm. No, she--
-  Oh, my God.

07:18.083 --> 07:20.083
We're orphans.
Oh, my God. You're Orphan Annie.

07:20.208 --> 07:23.375
- Oh, my God.
- She's not dead. She ran away.

07:25.416 --> 07:26.875
- That fucking bitch.

07:28.875 --> 07:30.291
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

07:32.041 --> 07:33.708
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:33.708 --> 07:36.583
So, we took the liberty of packing up
your mother’s belongings.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Thank you. What a pleasant eviction.

07:39.125 --> 07:43.916
Oh, good! I'm so glad. Oh? Great news!
It looks like your mom left a note.

07:44.708 --> 07:47.083
It’s mostly personal attacks on me.

07:47.458 --> 07:51.333
Oh, but it does say
she and Jeff are off to Macao.

07:51.583 --> 07:53.833
So, at least you know where she is!

07:54.708 --> 07:55.791
- Who's Jeff?
- Who's Jeff?

07:55.958 --> 07:58.500
- She has a boyfriend?

07:58.666 --> 08:00.416
I mean, why didn't she tell us?

08:01.416 --> 08:03.458
Because she only calls
when she needs money.

08:07.666 --> 08:09.000
Oh, you’re parked right by me!

08:11.166 --> 08:13.875
- Are you living out of your car?

08:15.208 --> 08:16.208
No!

08:16.333 --> 08:20.458
It's just some stuff I've been meaning
to donate and... Oh, my God.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.375
This amazing lamp that I found in an alley

08:23.750 --> 08:27.166
and some... blankets,
in case I wanted a nap.

08:28.625 --> 08:29.666
Well...

08:30.166 --> 08:32.125
sorry, you wasted all your time
driving out here.

08:32.708 --> 08:33.875
Oh, actually...

08:36.500 --> 08:39.250
I was hoping that maybe I can stay
with you for a little bit.

08:40.625 --> 08:41.625
Why?

08:43.250 --> 08:46.541
Well, I thought I was going to
since Mom was dead.

08:50.291 --> 08:51.916
Come on, Annie.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.583
Come on, it's gonna be fun!

08:55.166 --> 08:57.500
- And I really wanna see my dog.
- Your dog?

08:57.500 --> 09:01.041
I made it to the final round of auditions
for <i>The Real World!</i>

09:01.041 --> 09:03.458
I have to go to L.A. tomorrow
to meet with the producers!

09:03.458 --> 09:05.250
- Oh, my God!
- But...

09:05.416 --> 09:08.000
- What about your puppy?
-  Oh, yeah.

09:08.708 --> 09:10.458
Can you take care of Mr. Linguini?

09:10.583 --> 09:13.916
-  <i>You added 2,500 dollars...</i>
-  Thanks! Thank you!

09:14.041 --> 09:15.666
<i>- ...and that's not nothing.</i>

09:17.708 --> 09:20.791
You know, it feels smaller.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.833
- Are you sure you didn't make it smaller?
- No, I didn’t shrink my house.

09:25.166 --> 09:26.416
- Oh, my God!
- What?

09:26.541 --> 09:27.583
He's dead.

09:29.333 --> 09:34.250
No, he's sleeping! Mr. Linguini! Hey!
Psst, psst, psst.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.875
See? Full of life.

09:41.375 --> 09:42.375
Shit!

09:49.375 --> 09:55.000
- So, uh... how long you planning on staying?
- Oh, I don't know. A few days.

09:56.625 --> 10:01.916
Few days?
Don't they need you back at your... job?

10:02.083 --> 10:03.458
Oh, no, I don't have a job.

10:03.958 --> 10:06.541
Okay, well, are you looking for a job?

10:06.541 --> 10:10.125
I’m focusing all my energy
on manifesting the life I want.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.458
But what...
What are you gonna do for money?

10:15.458 --> 10:18.250
Because I don't know
if I can lend you any more.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.625
And Mom's nursing home

10:19.750 --> 10:20.958
- isn't exactly--
- Okay, I don't need money.

10:20.958 --> 10:22.458
I'm getting plenty from my lawsuit.

10:23.208 --> 10:27.083
From your... From your what?
From your lawsuit? Sorry, what lawsuit?

10:27.333 --> 10:29.375
Oh, I didn't tell you? Oh, my God.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.375
I had a business lunch at Choochie's

10:31.375 --> 10:33.541
with this guy
who wanted to invest in my fashion line,

10:33.541 --> 10:37.291
and I took a bite of my tilapia filet,
and there was a fish bone in it.

10:37.291 --> 10:40.166
<i>It got stuck in my throat,
and I almost choked to death.</i>

10:41.833 --> 10:42.833
So, I sued them.

10:43.625 --> 10:44.750
So, you sued Choochie’s

10:44.750 --> 10:46.833
because there was a fish bone
in your fish fillet?

10:46.958 --> 10:48.875
I'm sorry. I almost died.

10:48.875 --> 10:51.250
Why can't you just be happy
I got a bunch of money from them?

10:51.708 --> 10:53.916
I mean, who are you? Mr. Choochie's?

10:54.500 --> 10:56.583
Now, why would I be "Mr. Choochie's?"

10:56.708 --> 10:58.250
'Cause it's a man's world.

11:02.041 --> 11:06.000
Don't... Don't just leave
that hair there, please.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.250
Okay, Dad.

11:11.375 --> 11:14.500
Oh, my God.
Do you have a <i>Quiz</i> alarm on your phone?

11:14.500 --> 11:17.416
- Come on, Linguini! It's <i>Quiz</i> time.

11:17.416 --> 11:20.208
<i>Let’s meet tonight's contestants.
Starting with our returning champion...</i>

11:20.208 --> 11:21.291
Yeah, there you go.

11:21.291 --> 11:25.875
...Ron Heacock from--
Excuse me! From Ohio.

11:26.333 --> 11:28.833
- You okay, Terry?
- Yes. I just ate some crackers backstage.

11:28.958 --> 11:31.041
<i>Must’ve gotten some crumbs
down the wrong pipe.</i>

11:31.708 --> 11:33.500
- That’s live television for you.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.958
Good. 'Cause I worry about you, Terry.
You work so hard.

11:35.958 --> 11:38.625
You should loosen up that bow tie.
Take a vacation.

11:38.625 --> 11:41.583
- Aww.
- Don't "aww" him. He's a jerk.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.500
But he seems so nice. And he's so smiley.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.666
He's not. It's an act.

11:45.875 --> 11:49.541
He's trying to be like Terry.
And look at how shiny his hands are.

11:49.541 --> 11:53.666
- He puts makeup on his hands.
- Some people have ugly hands.

11:53.791 --> 11:55.791
...all the way from Kentucky,

11:55.791 --> 11:58.541
Margret, I have to ask you,
did you ride your horse to the studio?

11:59.666 --> 12:01.125
Welcome.

12:01.416 --> 12:04.000
And your time starts now.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.208
<i>- What is the square root of 196?</i>
- Fourteen.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.791
-  Ron? Correct.
- Fourteen.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.333
- How many hearts does an octopus have?
- Three.

12:10.333 --> 12:11.583
-  Ron? Correct.
- Three.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.791
- What?
-  <i>What spice is derived</i>

12:13.791 --> 12:15.416
from <i>Crocus sativus?</i>

12:15.541 --> 12:18.416
- Saffron.
- I feel like an answer hog. But saffron.

12:18.416 --> 12:19.583
<i>Correct.</i>

12:19.583 --> 12:20.875
- Carbon dioxide.
-  <i>Very good.</i>

12:20.875 --> 12:22.666
-  Wellington, New Zealand.
-  <i>Correct.</i>

12:22.666 --> 12:24.041
Saturn. <i>Our American Cousin.</i>

12:24.166 --> 12:25.416
The equal sign.

12:25.416 --> 12:26.625
<i>- Harry Potter.
- The Hobbit.</i>

12:26.750 --> 12:29.541
-  <i>Correct.</i>
- All right. Bless you.

12:29.541 --> 12:32.833
<i>Ron, please list for us
the gods of Mount Olympus.</i>

12:33.250 --> 12:39.375
Aphrodite, Apollo, Ares, Artemis, Athena,
Demeter, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Her-- Hey!

12:39.541 --> 12:40.916
Why haven't you gone on that show?

12:41.208 --> 12:42.916
Are you scared that you would win
so much money

12:42.916 --> 12:44.375
that people will try and kill you for it?

12:44.500 --> 12:45.833
You know,
that's a thing with lottery winners.

12:46.291 --> 12:47.791
- No, it's not--
-  Are you scared

12:47.916 --> 12:50.666
that your hatred for that Ron guy
is actually a sexual attraction

12:50.666 --> 12:53.000
that you wouldn't know
how to navigate in person?

12:53.625 --> 12:54.750
No!

12:55.208 --> 12:59.041
It's just... I'm not... good at...

13:00.208 --> 13:02.250
being looked at, you know?

13:03.958 --> 13:06.000
It’s time for the Flip!

13:06.000 --> 13:08.541
-  <i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>
-  Stupid coin.

13:08.666 --> 13:11.708
- I love the coin. It's so big.
- ...seven, six, five,

13:12.166 --> 13:15.916
four, three, two, one.

13:18.166 --> 13:19.416
-  Show it!
-  Show it!

13:19.416 --> 13:23.375
- Show it.
- Our contestants will act out the answers

13:23.375 --> 13:25.083
while their partners guess.

13:26.083 --> 13:29.125
Wait, what are you doing?
The charades thing is the only fun part!

13:29.250 --> 13:31.375
It’s not fun, it’s a cheap gimmick.

13:31.916 --> 13:35.250
They changed the entire final round
to boost ratings, it's so dumb.

13:35.791 --> 13:37.875
Who wants to watch people
embarrass themselves?

13:38.750 --> 13:39.750
I do.

13:42.625 --> 13:44.166
Waltz. Waltzer.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.625
Oh, my God. He's dancing.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.791
Sidewalk. Concrete.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.250
Waltzer. Concrete... Walter Cronkite.

13:52.250 --> 13:54.083


13:54.583 --> 13:55.833
Who's Walter Cronkite?

13:55.958 --> 13:57.583

I want to be rich and famous,
and loved by everybody. Why?

14:47.375 --> 14:51.750
Because I want to be a powerful force
for good in this world, you know?

14:52.250 --> 14:55.875
I just haven't found, you know,
the path to get there yet.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.250
I mean, do you have any idea

14:58.250 --> 15:00.875
how hard it is
to be an Asian woman in this country?

15:01.125 --> 15:04.416
- Yes, I read an article.
- Like, we have to keep going.

15:04.416 --> 15:07.041
Like, I've always wanted to open
my own bakery, you know?

15:07.041 --> 15:08.458
- And then life got in the way.
- Mm-hmm.

15:08.583 --> 15:10.250
And now, I never bake anymore,

15:10.375 --> 15:12.250
and I feel so unfulfilled.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.500
You need to change your life.

15:14.958 --> 15:18.208
You can because you're strong.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.875
So, are you done with your plate?

15:23.333 --> 15:25.250
- Oh, yeah.

15:30.875 --> 15:33.708
Since when does it take you 20 minutes
to service one table?

15:33.708 --> 15:35.125
We started talking.

15:35.125 --> 15:38.166
-  You can't just sit and hang out.
-  She believes in me, Carl.

15:38.750 --> 15:39.916
Oh, my God!

15:40.500 --> 15:41.500
Thanks!

15:49.916 --> 15:52.000
Hi. I had a huge day.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.375
- Why are you sitting out here?
-  Oh, I locked myself out.

15:54.375 --> 15:57.791
- Well, let's get inside before--
- Anne, is this lunatic your sister?

15:57.791 --> 15:59.083
I told you.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.083
She threatened to call the cops
because she thought I was, what?

16:01.083 --> 16:03.041
- Was it loitering?
- You were loitering.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.333
I thought you were loitering
with an intent to murder.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.458
Oh, do I look like a murderer?

16:06.833 --> 16:08.916
- Yes. Well, yes, you do.
-  Oh, really?

16:09.041 --> 16:12.208
-  I can see your brassiere.
- Okay, okay. I'm... I'm sorry about her.

16:12.458 --> 16:14.333
- Like--
- Sorry about me? What did I do?

16:14.333 --> 16:16.291
- Why are you-- Why?
- Put a sock in it.

16:16.625 --> 16:20.833
Okay, so, I went to go get coffee
and I met this woman.

16:20.833 --> 16:24.875
Oh, my God! She was so sad.
But we got to talking, and I helped her.

16:25.166 --> 16:27.291
And helping her made me feel better.

16:27.291 --> 16:29.916
And just like that, I saw it.
I saw the path forward.

16:30.458 --> 16:31.625
Don't move my stuff.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.875
Why do you have
a bobblehead of Justin Timberlake?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.708
It's Terry McTeer,
and it's limited edition.

16:36.708 --> 16:38.416
It’s from the 300th episode!

16:38.416 --> 16:41.958
Do you know the heated eBay war
I had to endure to get that?

16:42.125 --> 16:44.833
-  It's Justin Timberlake.
- It's Terry McTeer.

16:45.041 --> 16:48.916
Okay, as I was saying, I have decided

16:49.208 --> 16:50.875
I am going to become...

16:51.625 --> 16:52.666
a life coach.

16:53.791 --> 16:57.583
- You know, like Oprah.
-  Oh, yeah. Yes. Linguini!

16:57.583 --> 17:00.250
- What's so funny? This is my destiny.
-  Oh, there you are.

17:00.416 --> 17:01.583
Yeah, you and your destinies.

17:01.583 --> 17:04.166
First, it was figure skating,
then it was acting, and then...

17:04.166 --> 17:05.916
And then you wanted to be a music icon.

17:05.916 --> 17:07.833
- And then it was fashion design.
- Yeah, but this is different.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
How?

17:09.333 --> 17:12.541
I'll show you, you know what?
Because you're gonna be my first project.

17:12.833 --> 17:14.208
I don't need a life coach.

17:14.208 --> 17:17.000
Uh, really? Because from what I can tell,

17:17.000 --> 17:21.166
you’re like a 28-year-old woman,
living the life of a 98-year-old widower.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.708
I'm 33.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.958
And why am I always a man
in your hypotheticals?

17:26.625 --> 17:27.666
Because men are worse.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.541
Well,
I like my life just the way it is.

17:30.125 --> 17:35.125
<i>Okay, Ron. Chuck has chosen geography.
Let's see what we have for you.</i>

17:35.416 --> 17:36.791
<i>- Please list for us...</i>
- What are you doing?

17:37.083 --> 17:38.833
-  <i>...South American capital cities.</i>
- Yoga.

17:39.291 --> 17:45.333
Buenos Aires, Lima, Sucre, Brasília,
Santiago, Bogotá, Quito, Caracas,

17:45.333 --> 17:48.458
- Montevideo, Asunción.
<i>- Caracas...</i>

17:50.541 --> 17:53.833
I knew I should have paid more attention
when I backpacked through South America

17:53.833 --> 17:55.750
- after I graduated law school.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.166
Darn it.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.833
<i>Let's see, Chuck, it's your turn.
How about language?</i>

18:00.458 --> 18:04.916
<i>Chuck, please list for us
nouns that do not have a singular form.</i>

18:05.125 --> 18:10.500
Scissors, clothes, pants, jeans, trousers,
shorts, tights, goggles, sunglasses,

18:10.500 --> 18:12.375
tweezers, belongings, boxers, briefs.

18:12.791 --> 18:15.291
North American river borders.
All right, okay.

18:15.291 --> 18:17.333
Detroit, Pine, Pigeon, Rainy.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.791
Saint Clair, Saint Croix, Saint Francis,
Saint Lawrence, Saint Mary's.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.416
Nucleus, nucleolus, mitochondria,
Golgi complex, cell membrane,

18:24.416 --> 18:26.458
nuclear envelope, cytoskeleton.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.916
Did you see it? I was like,
"Don't we work with that girl?"

18:31.041 --> 18:32.541
And I was like, "Oh, my God. Yes, I do."

18:32.541 --> 18:34.083
And then I was-- Oh, my God!

18:34.083 --> 18:37.541
- Hey, it's the Quiz Lady.
- What?

18:37.750 --> 18:41.083
You were like,
"Spain. Killer whale. Octagon."

18:41.208 --> 18:43.333
- So, what are you talking about?
- Hello!

18:43.333 --> 18:45.458
You're on the front page of Reddit.
Your video.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.250
<i>...outskirts, premises, surroundings.</i>

18:53.833 --> 18:54.916
Oh, no.

18:57.166 --> 18:59.500
Oh, Quiz Lady.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.791
Oh, my God.

19:02.583 --> 19:05.375
<i>- ...lysosomes, ribosomes, nucleus...</i>
- Oh, no.

19:06.375 --> 19:09.708
Yo, what up fam? As promised,
The Quiz Lady.

19:09.833 --> 19:12.750
Yo, that video was so funny, dude.
I dropped my phone in the toilet.

19:13.041 --> 19:14.125
Don't worry, just pee.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.458
Can you give me, like,
a quick "wassup" to my followers?

19:16.625 --> 19:18.583
No! I need a minute.

19:23.625 --> 19:26.625
- Hi, have you seen Twitter?
- How did this happen?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.250
<i>You are viral!</i>

19:28.250 --> 19:29.375
I posted it last night,

19:29.375 --> 19:31.500
and then when I woke up
this morning it was everywhere.

19:31.750 --> 19:34.916
I mean, I have a ton of followers
from that time Elon Musk yelled at me.

19:34.916 --> 19:36.791
- But...
- Delete... Delete it right now.

19:36.916 --> 19:39.541
Wait! You cannot buy this hype.
Get this, get this!

19:39.541 --> 19:41.083
- Okay, the producers...
- I have to go.

19:42.541 --> 19:44.708
- I'm still here.
- She always does this.

19:44.708 --> 19:46.875
She just floats through life
without ever thinking

19:46.875 --> 19:48.458
about how her actions affect other people.

19:48.458 --> 19:51.416
Did you know that when were kids
we went to the Heinz Ketchup Museum,

19:51.416 --> 19:53.500
our father brought us there,
and she was furious

19:53.500 --> 19:55.958
'cause she wanted to watch <i>Supercop 3,</i>
and she'd just gotten it on DVD.

19:55.958 --> 19:58.375
<i>And, so, she knocks over
an entire display of ketchup</i>

19:58.375 --> 20:00.208
and we get thrown out onto the street

20:00.375 --> 20:02.125
<i>by a Heinz ketchup security guard.</i>

20:02.750 --> 20:04.625
<i>And I really wanted
to learn about ketchup.</i>

20:05.041 --> 20:06.291
I wanted to have that experience.

20:06.291 --> 20:08.250
I didn't get to have that experience.
Now, look at me now.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.375
I think it's just tomatoes, though.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.583
- You know, with sugar and spices.
- Oh, my God.

20:11.708 --> 20:13.125
They want me to be on local news.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.333
-  Dope!
- I don't want to be news.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.000
I would kill to be local news.

20:18.458 --> 20:19.625
Internal auditing.

20:19.625 --> 20:22.541
<i>Quiz Lady! I'm a huge fan.
My name's Gerald.</i>

20:22.541 --> 20:24.666
<i>I'm what you might call a sexual cannibal.</i>

20:25.416 --> 20:27.791
<i>It is what you think it is,
and do you wanna get lunch?</i>

20:27.791 --> 20:31.541
The internet knows where I work.
The internet knows where I work.

20:33.083 --> 20:35.083
<i>Niagara, Detroit, Pine, Detroit...</i>

20:40.083 --> 20:41.916
- Hey, say something smart.
- Sorry. I can't.

20:41.916 --> 20:43.083
Come on!

20:50.958 --> 20:51.958
Anne Yum.

20:53.166 --> 20:54.541
I didn't mean to startle you.

20:54.708 --> 20:57.125
I'm a friend of your mom's.
Do you know where she is?

20:57.458 --> 20:58.708
No, sorry.

20:58.708 --> 21:01.250
You sure?
'Cause I'd really like to find her.

21:01.375 --> 21:02.708
She owes me some money.

21:04.583 --> 21:06.041
She-- She said she quit.

21:06.583 --> 21:09.750
Aside from occasional penny slots.
How much does she owe?

21:09.875 --> 21:12.000
- Eighty grand.
- Eighty grand?

21:12.125 --> 21:13.416
And imagine my pleasant surprise

21:13.416 --> 21:16.041
when her daughter
with the goofy little bangs became famous.

21:16.291 --> 21:18.375
Saved me all the trouble
of tracking you down.

21:18.666 --> 21:19.791
So, where is she?

21:23.291 --> 21:26.541
Do you really want to protect her?
You probably don't even like her.

21:26.541 --> 21:28.291
I know I don't.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.458
Come on, don't be stupid.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.458
Tell me where she is.

21:35.458 --> 21:36.458
Macao.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.208
- Macao.
- I can't help you.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.916
Of course, you can.
You can cover her debt.

21:42.250 --> 21:44.125
I don't have 80,000 dollars.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.541
Neither do I, and that's the problem.

21:48.625 --> 21:49.750
Call me when you have it...

21:50.458 --> 21:51.916
and you'll get your dog back.

21:53.625 --> 21:54.708
My dog?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.458
- My dog?
- You have two weeks.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.625
After that, you'll never see him again.

22:02.541 --> 22:04.000
Let's go grab some cronuts.

22:06.416 --> 22:08.958
- Amazing! We'll be there, thank you.

22:13.708 --> 22:14.875
Linguini!

22:16.583 --> 22:19.708
-  Annie, what's going on?
-  Linguini!

22:25.791 --> 22:27.375
Who's even named Ken anymore?

22:27.583 --> 22:30.500
This is all your fault.
He found me because of your stupid video.

22:32.583 --> 22:34.541
- Are you calling him?
- I'm calling Mom.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.541
It's not gonna do anything.

22:36.666 --> 22:38.208
-  <i>Jenny?</i>

22:38.208 --> 22:40.000
You left us with an 80,000 dollars debt?

22:40.250 --> 22:41.916
<i>It's okay, I'm in Macao.</i>

22:42.083 --> 22:44.500
<i>Jeff, get me another Mai Tai!</i>

22:44.750 --> 22:47.458
Okay, you know what?
It's not okay. None of this is okay.

22:47.625 --> 22:50.208
Your bookie threatened Annie
and kidnapped my dog.

22:50.416 --> 22:51.416
He's not your dog.

22:51.750 --> 22:52.791
<i>Not a bad deal.</i>

22:52.916 --> 22:55.416
<i>- That dog's so old.</i>
-  That's not the point!

22:55.416 --> 22:58.291
<i>What do you expect me
to do about it? I'm in Macao!</i>

22:58.291 --> 23:01.291
You need to fix it.
We can't afford to pay them off!

23:01.291 --> 23:05.166
<i>Fine! Come to Macao.
Jeff rented a condo. But no free rides.</i>

23:05.291 --> 23:07.333
We don't wanna live in your goddamn condo.

23:07.541 --> 23:09.750
<i>Don't swear.
Aiya, who raised you?</i>

23:09.958 --> 23:11.083
Nobody!

23:14.083 --> 23:17.541
- Told you.

23:19.041 --> 23:22.000
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
- What? What? Are they here?

23:22.166 --> 23:25.083
Annie, Annie, Annie!
This is all connected.

23:25.666 --> 23:27.166
This is synergy from the universe.

23:27.458 --> 23:29.625
Oh, my God.
I think I might have manifested this.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.083
I hate all the words you just used.

23:33.083 --> 23:35.208
Oh, my God.
This is how you're gonna make the money.

23:35.208 --> 23:38.250
Okay, someone from the <i>Quiz</i> just called.
They saw your video.

23:38.458 --> 23:42.041
What? No! No! That is so embarrassing.

23:42.041 --> 23:44.125
No, no, no, no.
No, see, they loved it,

23:44.125 --> 23:46.458
and they're in the middle
of a casting round,

23:46.458 --> 23:47.833
and they want-- No, come on.

23:47.833 --> 23:50.875
They want you to come
to the in-person regional auditions

23:50.875 --> 23:53.333
this weekend. Where? In Philadelphia!

23:53.333 --> 23:55.958
- No, that's not happening.
- Oh, my God. Why not?

23:55.958 --> 23:58.166
I mean, you could win
80,000 dollars just like that.

23:58.166 --> 23:59.708
I mean, you got every question right.

23:59.708 --> 24:02.750
I can't play on live TV
in front of millions of people.

24:02.750 --> 24:04.541
In front of Terry-freakin' McTeer.

24:05.583 --> 24:08.291
I can't, I can't.
There has to be another way.

24:10.791 --> 24:13.458
You could sell your eggs.
I mean, it's not like you're using them.

24:14.125 --> 24:16.500
- I'm not gonna sell my eggs.
- Okay!

24:18.291 --> 24:21.000
Well, I am not gonna let
Mom's bullshit ruin your life.

24:21.750 --> 24:24.041
- Too late.

24:29.666 --> 24:31.041
So, I looked on CarMax,

24:31.166 --> 24:34.750
and it said I could easily sell my car
for around 20,000...

24:43.166 --> 24:47.333
Hi. The paperboy
missed the porch again, but by a mile.

24:47.458 --> 24:49.625
I mean, he threw it
in the driveway, the jerk.

24:50.041 --> 24:51.833
I'm pretty sure he's vaping drugs again.

24:52.541 --> 24:53.958
Bending over that far,

24:54.083 --> 24:58.166
it’s actually dangerous
for an almost ghost like me.

24:58.875 --> 24:59.916
Could you help?

25:01.458 --> 25:04.291
Oh, say, uh,
can I borrow your phone a sec?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.916
I just want to check on my stocks.

25:08.458 --> 25:12.291
- Is everything all right? You seem weird.
- What do you mean? I’m fine.

25:13.583 --> 25:16.291
- Since when do you invest?
-  What's it to you?

25:17.166 --> 25:18.291
Don’t be scared! It’s me!

25:18.583 --> 25:21.625
What?
What the... Jenny, not again!

25:21.750 --> 25:23.416
Don't worry!
We're getting your dog back!

25:23.416 --> 25:24.958
Hey!

25:25.250 --> 25:27.541
- What are you doing?
- I’m taking you to Philadelphia!

25:27.541 --> 25:29.375
- So, you can get on the show!
-  Jenny!

25:29.375 --> 25:30.750
Okay!

25:30.750 --> 25:31.875
Where's my 100 bucks?

25:31.875 --> 25:33.500
Thanks. Um, sorry,
I don't have any cash on me.

25:33.500 --> 25:34.958
Hey! How could you do this to me

25:34.958 --> 25:37.208
when I was just threatened
by a genuine Tong?

25:37.333 --> 25:39.083
That’s why I yelled,
“Don't be scared. It’s me!”

25:39.083 --> 25:40.666
-  Jenny!
- What is a Tong?

25:41.166 --> 25:43.208
Asian gangsters. You know, read a book.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.500
-  Jenny!
- Thank you very much.

25:44.500 --> 25:49.291
Jenny, let me out of here.
Francine! Francine, please!

25:49.291 --> 25:50.375
Grifter!

25:52.208 --> 25:55.416
Jenny! Let me out!
I will call the FBI!

25:55.416 --> 25:57.666
- Settle down!
-  You want me to settle down?

25:57.666 --> 26:00.083
- You kidnapped me!
- Oh, don’t be so dramatic!

26:00.083 --> 26:02.125
-  Jenny, Jenny--
- I put a bunch of, like, snacks

26:02.125 --> 26:04.416
and pillows in there,
so just sit back, relax.

26:04.416 --> 26:06.458
- Enjoy the ride.
-  Jenny, Jenny.

26:19.750 --> 26:22.041

26:24.791 --> 26:26.000
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Stop!

26:27.125 --> 26:31.083

27:00.333 --> 27:01.500

27:01.666 --> 27:03.291

27:03.291 --> 27:05.333
- Come on!
- No! No. No, no, no.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.375
-  You wanna run now?
-  I would outrun you! I ran track!

27:07.375 --> 27:09.916
-  What? You didn’t run track!
- I signed up for it!

27:10.500 --> 27:12.333
-  Not going to--
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

27:12.333 --> 27:13.416
No, no, no, no!

27:13.416 --> 27:14.708
Thought I couldn't outrun you.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.625

You are going to Philadelphia!

27:26.500 --> 27:27.625
What?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.916
I don't have time for this,
Linguini is in danger.

27:31.041 --> 27:33.500
That stupid show is the only way
we're gonna get him back.

27:33.791 --> 27:35.500
What about the Choochie’s money?

27:38.000 --> 27:39.416
There’s no Choochie’s money.

27:41.416 --> 27:43.333
Of course. Of course.

27:44.041 --> 27:46.208
Why would I ever think
that you could help?

27:50.791 --> 27:51.791
Look...

27:53.166 --> 27:57.083
the <i>Quiz</i> is the best and fastest option
for us to get the money.

27:57.083 --> 28:00.666
So, unless you want to sell your eggs,
we need to get to Philadelphia.

28:06.333 --> 28:09.208
- Fine. But I'm driving.
- Okay.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.333
Give me back my hair.

28:19.291 --> 28:21.458
-  <i>Come to Philly.</i>

28:21.916 --> 28:23.208
<i>We’re better than New York.</i>

28:24.291 --> 28:26.458
I always forget
how beautiful this city is.

28:27.291 --> 28:29.375
- Can you check that?

28:31.791 --> 28:33.708
- What? What is it?

28:38.125 --> 28:39.250
What the...

28:40.250 --> 28:42.250
What’s he gonna do to our dog?

28:42.625 --> 28:44.083
He isn’t gonna hurt him, right?

28:45.416 --> 28:46.416
No!

28:47.416 --> 28:50.625
No. It's okay.
Let's just get to the hotel.

28:52.958 --> 28:53.958
Yeah.

28:54.541 --> 28:56.958
- What's the address?
- I don't know, I’m still looking for one.

28:57.125 --> 28:58.833
You haven't booked one yet?

28:59.500 --> 29:02.833
Sorry. I was too busy making the trunk
comfortable for you.

29:03.041 --> 29:05.208
Besides, how hard is it
gonna be to find one?

29:05.333 --> 29:06.666
How was I supposed to know

29:06.666 --> 29:08.750
there was a pharmaceutical convention
this week?

29:11.125 --> 29:15.166
Good morrow, ladies.
Welcome to the Ben Franklin Inn & Spa.

29:15.166 --> 29:21.166
May I interest you in some johnnycakes
made fresh this morning by my lovely...

29:22.333 --> 29:23.333
self?

29:23.833 --> 29:25.000
Um, don’t touch that.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.416
-  We have a reservation.

29:27.541 --> 29:29.208
It’s under Anne Yum.

29:29.458 --> 29:33.541
Ah! Yes. I heard your voice
on that marvelous machine right there,

29:33.541 --> 29:37.833
that I have heard is called the telephone,
but I am unfamiliar with it.

29:38.541 --> 29:40.125
Identification and credit card, please.

29:40.458 --> 29:42.541
You don't know what a phone is,
but you know about credit cards?

29:43.125 --> 29:45.666
The concept of a credit card
is an easy one to grasp.

29:46.083 --> 29:51.541
I know what credit is, and I can assure
you I'm familiar with cards.

29:52.250 --> 29:54.625
But that talking machine
was invented after my time.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.500
- Oh, what is that sound?

29:56.750 --> 29:58.291
’Tis a chirping bird?

29:59.833 --> 30:01.333
Ben Franklin Inn, please hold.

30:02.083 --> 30:04.416
Uh, so, are you supposed
to be Ben Franklin?

30:04.958 --> 30:08.000
Because if Ben Franklin
had just been alive this whole time,

30:08.125 --> 30:11.000
he would know what phones are.
I mean, he was really smart.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Well, that is very kind of you to say
that I am smart.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.125
Yeah, but if you don't know
about phones, then what?

30:18.125 --> 30:22.625
You're just like a ghost of Ben Franklin,
who’s somehow stuck in the 1600s?

30:23.208 --> 30:26.166
- 1700s.
- And if you are stuck in the past,

30:26.166 --> 30:29.750
then your inn should not have
all this modern stuff. But it does.

30:29.750 --> 30:33.208
I mean, it makes no sense.
So, which is it? What are you?

30:34.333 --> 30:37.250
I... am Ben Franklin.

30:37.250 --> 30:39.041
Then why don't you have wooden teeth
like George Washington?

30:39.041 --> 30:43.083
- Jenny.
- And... lifting.

30:43.083 --> 30:47.458
- Can you just let him be Ben Franklin?
- In my family, we have wrinkly foreheads.

30:47.958 --> 30:50.166
I just want to let you know, sir,
that you're doing a great job.

30:51.166 --> 30:52.750
- Thank you.
- Good.

30:52.875 --> 30:56.500
Well, he's using a computer.
How very 17th century.

30:56.666 --> 30:58.375
- Eighteenth century.
- What?

30:58.583 --> 31:00.416
Even though your time is limited

31:00.416 --> 31:02.916
in our wonderful capital
of the United States of America,

31:03.083 --> 31:06.083
which is how I know it.
I, Ben Franklin, know it.

31:06.875 --> 31:09.791
If you need any help,
don't hesitate to call.

31:10.041 --> 31:12.750
- On the phone?
- Yes. On the phone.

31:13.208 --> 31:15.291
Future’s greatest gift.

31:16.125 --> 31:17.125
Tina!

31:18.958 --> 31:22.166
Would you please show our guests
to their chambers?

31:23.041 --> 31:25.125
Please take more time
putting your hat on.

31:25.625 --> 31:28.458
Just take your time.
Tina from the temp agency.

31:28.583 --> 31:29.833
Scooch, scooch.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.083
Welcome to the Betsy Ross suite.

31:36.583 --> 31:38.875
Oh, can you take this? Thank you.

31:40.791 --> 31:42.583
Right. Cute.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.458
Jenny, we’re too old to share a bed.

31:45.625 --> 31:51.250
Speak for yourself, Ben Franklin.
The thirties are the new twenties.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.000
Since when are you in your thirties?

31:53.125 --> 31:55.708
Oh, since I did a guess-my-age filter
and it said thirty...

31:57.166 --> 31:58.166
nine.

32:03.875 --> 32:07.208
You know, this place sucks.
Let's go to a real hotel.

32:07.333 --> 32:09.500
They have to have rooms
they keep open just in case.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.333
- I'll get them to give us one.
- How?

32:11.750 --> 32:14.458
Oh, I am amazing at getting stuff.

32:14.458 --> 32:18.416
I get really emotional and talk a lot,
so they get confused,

32:18.416 --> 32:21.916
and then they're willing to do
whatever they can to make it stop.

32:21.916 --> 32:23.666
See, just one second. Like this.

32:25.958 --> 32:28.041
Please! Oh, my God!

32:28.333 --> 32:30.000
I know you’re only serving
the breakfast menu,

32:30.000 --> 32:31.583
but my husband needs fries!

32:31.583 --> 32:34.791
He has a rare kidney condition,
and if he doesn’t get salt, he’ll die!

32:35.166 --> 32:38.666
I’m too young to be a widow! I’m only 39.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.666
See? Works every time.

32:41.666 --> 32:44.583
You would publicly humiliate yourself
just to eat fries at breakfast?

32:45.333 --> 32:46.541
How is that humiliating?

32:51.041 --> 32:52.458
- Oh!
-  What?

32:52.458 --> 32:54.583
There's no TV. I can't watch the <i>Quiz.</i>

32:55.625 --> 32:57.791
Wait. Annie, where are you going? Annie!

32:58.208 --> 33:01.666
Yeah, but right now?
I mean, is it such an emergency?

33:01.666 --> 33:04.250
I can't miss it. I've watched it
every day since I was four.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.041
Wait. You’ve never skipped a night?

33:06.166 --> 33:08.250
Neither has Terry. Nothing stops him.

33:08.375 --> 33:09.583
<i>- Not whiplash.</i>

33:09.583 --> 33:11.291
Somewhere-- Get the first question.

33:11.416 --> 33:13.833
- ...country that...
-  <i>An earthquake.</i>

33:13.833 --> 33:15.208
...borders Switzerland.

33:15.500 --> 33:18.750
-  <i>A swarm of bees.</i>
- The answer is Mr. Potato Head.

33:18.916 --> 33:20.125
<i>Not even Frat Week!</i>

33:20.125 --> 33:22.750
...which is, uh, one of the Twin Cities.

33:25.666 --> 33:26.791
Annie, what about, um...

33:27.208 --> 33:31.333
-  Hurry. It's probably starting!
- Jeez! Uh, are you...?

33:45.791 --> 33:47.500
Excuse me? Sir...

33:48.250 --> 33:49.666
- Try again.
- Excuse me.

33:49.833 --> 33:53.500
Hey! Would you mind
changing the channel to the <i>Quiz?</i>

33:53.791 --> 33:56.208
Holy shit. It's the Quiz Lady.

33:57.125 --> 34:00.250
Oh, no. I think you have me confused
for another Asian lady.

34:00.750 --> 34:02.708
Then why'd she ask to change
the channel to the <i>Quiz?</i>

34:02.708 --> 34:05.166
Put it on. I wanna see
if she know all that stuff.

34:05.166 --> 34:07.000
- 'Cause that video could have been fake.
- Fake?

34:07.000 --> 34:09.708
Yeah, right. Like, 100 bucks
says she gets them all right.

34:09.833 --> 34:12.708
Ooh! All right. Not like I care
about this game.

34:12.708 --> 34:14.958
Darryl, shut your hole. Phils are at bat.

34:14.958 --> 34:16.416
- Whoa! Whoa!
-  What are you doing?

34:16.583 --> 34:17.791
Making some money.

34:17.791 --> 34:19.708
- Hey, everybody!
-  I'm trying to watch the game!

34:19.708 --> 34:23.041
The Quiz Lady's here.
And she wants to play some <i>Quiz.</i>

34:23.041 --> 34:24.791
Hundred bucks
says she gets them all right.

34:24.791 --> 34:27.583
- All we need is one TV. What do you say?
-  Get down!

34:29.791 --> 34:32.833
<i>- Quiz! Quiz! Quiz! Quiz!</i>
- Jenny! Stop chanting!

34:32.833 --> 34:35.083
Chanting always works. <i>Quiz! Quiz!</i>

34:35.083 --> 34:37.375
<i>- Quiz! Quiz! Quiz!</i>
- I see you.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.000
<i>- Quiz! Quiz!</i>
- Stop! These are people

34:39.000 --> 34:41.125
who punch police horses
when they’re happy!

34:41.125 --> 34:43.416
Hey, that’s a stereotype, okay?
That happened two separate occasions.

34:43.416 --> 34:44.708
- Okay! Okay.
-  Come on!

34:46.041 --> 34:50.625
I’m not sitting down until I see
Terry McTeer’s face on this TV.

34:50.833 --> 34:52.416
I don't care what you throw...

34:55.708 --> 34:57.333
-  Is the TV okay?

34:59.958 --> 35:01.750
It was nice of that guy to drive us.

35:04.041 --> 35:07.125
You know, Phillies fans get a bad rap,
but deep down they’re nice.

35:07.958 --> 35:09.583
Sometimes stereotypes are wrong.

35:11.333 --> 35:12.416
They're always wrong.

35:13.041 --> 35:14.083
Hmm.

35:15.916 --> 35:18.500
It's funny, the word “stereotype”
has a fascinating etymology

35:18.500 --> 35:20.916
that I was reading about earlier--
Good Lord!

35:22.208 --> 35:26.625
How are you not in a massive amount
of pain right now?

35:26.750 --> 35:28.416
Oh, this happens all the time.

35:28.416 --> 35:31.875
Ever since I tried to catch a foul ball
at that World Series game.

35:33.083 --> 35:34.375
When I was dating Sammy.

35:35.250 --> 35:37.541
Anyway, it hurts when it pops out,

35:37.541 --> 35:39.833
and when it goes back in,
but in between, it’s not that bad.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.041
That is not just dislocated.
That is definitely broken.

35:43.041 --> 35:45.541
Oh, no, it's not.
I bet you, I could pop it back in myself.

35:45.541 --> 35:47.375
- No.
- Okay, but now, it’s gonna...

35:47.958 --> 35:49.416
- Okay. God!
- Jenny.

35:49.416 --> 35:51.166
God! Did you hear that? That was actually...

35:51.166 --> 35:52.375
- That was a crack!
- A little bit.

35:52.375 --> 35:53.833
- No, I can't.
- I’m gonna try it again. Wait.

35:53.833 --> 35:55.041
I can’t. It goes so far back!

35:55.041 --> 35:56.458
- Really? But it's...
- It goes so far back.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.291
- Does that gross you out?
- I’m gonna throw up!

36:00.000 --> 36:01.833
- Jenny!
- Okay. Okay.

36:02.833 --> 36:04.375
- Can you put the ice pack on it...
- Okay. Okay.

36:04.375 --> 36:06.166
...to cover it,
so I don’t have to look at it?

36:06.291 --> 36:07.958
'Cause you’re scared of my wrist.

36:09.416 --> 36:10.708
Really, it doesn’t hurt that much.

36:13.875 --> 36:15.291
Too bad cousin Jin isn't here.

36:15.416 --> 36:17.375
- Fix that up for you.

36:17.958 --> 36:21.416
-"Jin is the best..."

36:22.750 --> 36:26.416
"He's the best surgeon in the world."

36:29.291 --> 36:34.458
Do you remember that summer in California?
He was so into skateboarding

36:34.458 --> 36:36.333
- but he was terrible at it.
- Oh, yeah.

36:36.458 --> 36:38.583
- Oh, that was the best summer.
- Right?

36:38.583 --> 36:40.750
Oh, my God, when we hit the freeway...

36:41.333 --> 36:43.125
<i>Oh, I knew I found my destiny...</i>

36:44.500 --> 36:45.583
<i>Burbank.</i>

36:45.583 --> 36:49.333
<i>♪ It ain't no joke
I'd like to buy the world a toke ♪</i>

36:49.333 --> 36:50.750
<i>♪ And teach the world... ♪</i>

36:50.750 --> 36:53.666
<i>Everything just felt so possible.</i>

36:53.666 --> 36:57.458
<i>The world was big and bright,
and everyone was getting along.</i>

36:57.791 --> 37:01.250
<i>No one was yelling at me to turn down
my music or get a job.</i>

37:01.666 --> 37:04.375
<i>For the first time,
I felt like I belonged.</i>

37:06.750 --> 37:10.250
Too bad they hated us
and never invited us back.

37:14.375 --> 37:15.375
Yeah.

37:16.458 --> 37:19.125
I always hated being around them.

37:21.083 --> 37:22.666
They were so intimidating.

37:23.541 --> 37:27.041
<i>When we went to go stay with them,
I was so nervous...</i>

37:29.625 --> 37:33.125
that I didn't shit for, like,
the whole month we were there.

37:35.333 --> 37:39.458
So, one night, I woke up with just...

37:42.083 --> 37:45.333
the gurgles. You know what I mean? And...

37:47.708 --> 37:52.875
I was so scared that maybe they would,
like, hear it or that I’d clog the toilet

37:52.875 --> 37:54.958
or, like, something would happen.

37:57.458 --> 37:59.541
So, I went out in the backyard...

38:01.125 --> 38:02.583
and I dug a little hole...

38:04.208 --> 38:05.416
and I shit in there.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.958
That's how unwelcome I felt in that house.

38:16.375 --> 38:17.958
I never told anyone about that.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.375
It was all too much.

38:24.583 --> 38:28.125
The way that they would look at us
like we were... trash.

38:31.125 --> 38:35.875
No, they... They wanted to help,
that's why they let us stay there.

38:36.375 --> 38:38.250
They didn’t even talk about Dad.

38:39.125 --> 38:41.250
They were so embarrassed
about how he died.

38:42.291 --> 38:43.875
Divorced, broke...

38:44.916 --> 38:47.000
falling off a singles’ cruise
because he was trying to do

38:47.000 --> 38:48.875
the “king of the world” thing
from <i>Titanic.</i>

38:49.458 --> 38:54.208
Drowning in the Caribbean.
Like a... sad loser.

38:54.208 --> 38:58.083
Don’t say that.
He wasn't a loser. He was...

38:58.875 --> 39:00.791
-  <i>Jennifer Yum.</i>

39:03.166 --> 39:05.166
Well, good news.

39:06.250 --> 39:07.583
Doesn't seem to be broken.

39:08.666 --> 39:10.000
- Just dislocated.
- Mm.

39:10.291 --> 39:12.375
- I can just go ahead and...
- Oh!

39:12.666 --> 39:15.791
-  Hmm?
- Oh, wow! I told you.

39:16.958 --> 39:20.541
How can I ever thank you
for saving my wrist?

39:20.541 --> 39:22.041
Oh, it's quite all right.

39:22.041 --> 39:25.500
- Maybe, like, a drink later?
- Well, I'm married. And gay.

39:26.750 --> 39:28.458
Why’d you have to say two reasons?

39:34.916 --> 39:37.541
- Oh, my God.
- What? What... What’s wrong?

39:37.541 --> 39:39.625
-  Ken. He sent me a video.

39:39.791 --> 39:41.291
Give it to me. I’ll look at it.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.708
<i>Mr. Linguini's getting
nice and comfortable over here.</i>

39:47.291 --> 39:50.916
<i>The longer you take to pay me back,
the happier he is with me.</i>

39:51.500 --> 39:55.208
<i>We’re calling him Porky now.
Isn’t that right, Mr. Porky?</i>

39:55.208 --> 39:56.500
<i>Want some wagyu?</i>

39:57.541 --> 39:58.708
<i>“Don’t mind if I do.”</i>

39:59.708 --> 40:01.750
<i>That’s how I picture him sounding
if he could talk.</i>

40:02.666 --> 40:03.958
<i>You’re running out of time.</i>

40:04.083 --> 40:06.458
He’s gonna make it
so Linguini never wants to leave.

40:06.791 --> 40:10.708
Oh, that’s kinda brilliant.
Uh, in a bad way.

40:10.708 --> 40:12.375
In a bad-- Hey.

40:12.625 --> 40:14.958
Hey, hey, hey! It's gonna be okay.

40:14.958 --> 40:16.958
-  Linguini.
- We are gonna get him back, I promise.

40:17.208 --> 40:18.458
Don’t look at your phone.

40:19.666 --> 40:22.458
Do you have a laptop or something?
‘Cause I can't sleep without noise.

40:22.458 --> 40:23.750
Yeah, in that blue bag.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.375
Ah, whoo! Pop!

40:30.333 --> 40:34.791
- When did you get this? 1970?
-  Chad gave it to me.

40:34.916 --> 40:37.333
He was with the CIA,
so you know it’s powerful.

40:40.083 --> 40:42.291
- Who is Chad?
-  Oh, you remember Chad.

40:42.291 --> 40:44.166
I mean, aren’t you supposed
to have a great memory?

40:44.166 --> 40:45.791
Yeah, for things of note.

40:47.166 --> 40:50.875
Oh, well. I remember
everyone you've ever dated

40:50.875 --> 40:53.125
since it was just that one
weird kid who was so pale

40:53.125 --> 40:54.416
he was practically see-through.

40:54.958 --> 40:57.333
Francoise was not see-through.

40:57.333 --> 41:00.250
Yeah, well. It was like someone
Saran-wrapped a skeleton.

41:00.708 --> 41:03.541
- Ooh, Kahi Bounce Balm?
- No.

41:03.541 --> 41:05.333
Are you sure? It’s Korean.

41:05.333 --> 41:08.500
And also, Francoise and I weren’t dating,
we were just friends.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.666
It wasn’t his fault
that he was allergic to the sun.

41:10.666 --> 41:12.583
- What are you doing?
- I want space.

41:12.958 --> 41:15.916
Ah, okay. Well, I sleep with two pillows.

41:15.916 --> 41:18.083
- Thank you very much. Yes, I do.
- Do you sleep with two pillows?

41:18.208 --> 41:20.583
Because you can sleep
with two pillows on the floor.

41:20.583 --> 41:22.541
I’m sorry, I’m injured,
I'm not sleeping on the floor.

41:22.666 --> 41:25.250
- I'm not sleeping on the floor, either.
- Then sleep on the chair.

41:25.750 --> 41:27.541
I don't wanna sleep in a sitting position.

41:27.541 --> 41:29.375
Oh, my God. What is the big deal?

41:29.375 --> 41:32.875
- We used to sleep together all the time.
- Yeah, 20 years ago, before you left.

41:37.958 --> 41:39.458
Fine, pillow wall.

41:47.375 --> 41:49.416
All right, you know what?
This is not half, by the way.

41:49.416 --> 41:50.500
Yes, it is.

41:54.333 --> 41:56.500
I know you're really nervous
about tomorrow.

41:58.375 --> 42:01.041
But is there at least
a small part of you that's excited?

42:03.708 --> 42:04.708
Maybe.

42:05.541 --> 42:06.541
A little bit.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.958
You are gonna be great.

42:18.666 --> 42:22.958
<i>I can’t believe what I’m reading.
Are all three of you librarians?</i>

42:24.875 --> 42:25.916
Linguini?

42:27.125 --> 42:28.958
Linguini! Linguini, come here!

42:29.083 --> 42:30.375
- Linguini!
- Linguini!

42:42.416 --> 42:43.416
Annie.

42:44.916 --> 42:45.916
Annie, wake up.

42:46.250 --> 42:47.541
It’s audition day.

42:49.333 --> 42:50.541
It’s so cold.

42:51.291 --> 42:52.291
It says,

42:52.458 --> 42:55.333
-"Report to the Liberty Conference Room."

42:55.333 --> 42:58.000
Jesus, this city is,
like, obsessed with freedom.

43:03.125 --> 43:06.166
Annie. Annie. Annie. Annie. Okay.

43:06.375 --> 43:08.833
Okay. Look at me.
How are you feeling? How are you feeling?

43:08.958 --> 43:10.000
Bad.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.250
-  Okay.
- I can't do this.

43:11.375 --> 43:12.958
- Yeah, yes, yes.
- Am I sweating?

43:13.708 --> 43:15.500
Um... yeah. You know what?

43:15.708 --> 43:18.666
Put your arms down.
Just put your arms down.

43:18.916 --> 43:23.666
Okay, good. Deep breath, deep breath.
One deep breath. Okay, you know what?

43:23.666 --> 43:25.416
- I can’t do this.
- Yes, you can!

43:25.416 --> 43:26.625
-  Mm-mm.
- No! Yes, you can.

43:26.625 --> 43:30.750
Annie. Yes, yes, yes. You know why?

43:31.833 --> 43:32.958
Because you're strong.

43:33.916 --> 43:38.750
Yeah? Okay. All right, let’s go.
Let’s go! Strong girl. Strong girl.

43:45.291 --> 43:48.208
-  Hey!
- Hi! Oh, you must be here to audition.

43:48.208 --> 43:49.708
- Thank you.
-  Have a seat.

43:49.708 --> 43:50.916
Yep.

43:51.041 --> 43:54.041
Take it, take it. Sit down. Okay.

43:54.208 --> 43:57.291
All right. It’s all good. So exciting.

43:59.291 --> 44:00.833
There’s too many people here.

44:00.958 --> 44:02.083
Oh, don’t think about them.

44:02.208 --> 44:05.500
Just focus on the fact that you need
this money to save Mr. Linguini's life.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.333
That’s not helping.

44:08.166 --> 44:10.458
I can't do this. I can’t go on the show.

44:10.458 --> 44:13.041
I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm--
I'm gonna end up like Marybeth Windlemore!

44:13.375 --> 44:14.750
Who’s Marybeth Windlemore?

44:15.375 --> 44:17.500
The lowest-scoring contestant of all time.

44:18.041 --> 44:21.833
<i>She barely made it through
the Head to Head, and then she just froze.</i>

44:22.250 --> 44:23.541
- Martha Stewart.

44:24.250 --> 44:27.541
- No... No. I mean... [stammers] Betty White.

44:27.750 --> 44:30.833
US First Ladies. Focus on the topic.

44:32.250 --> 44:34.708
- Nancy Sta... Stalin.

44:35.291 --> 44:36.375
Oh!

44:36.583 --> 44:39.625
- And the internet was so mean to her.

44:40.125 --> 44:41.833
People hate it
when women are bad at things.

44:41.958 --> 44:43.375
You're not gonna be bad.
You're gonna be great.

44:43.583 --> 44:46.000
People don’t like it
when women are good at things, either!

44:46.458 --> 44:50.375
And the only reason
why I'm good is because I'm at home.

44:50.541 --> 44:51.875
It's just me and Linguini.

44:52.500 --> 44:55.041
I-- I-- I can’t play
in front of all these people.

44:55.041 --> 44:56.833
I-- I--
I think we should just sell my eggs.

44:56.833 --> 44:59.875
No, no, no, no. No.
Annie, look at me.

45:00.041 --> 45:01.208
Look at me. Annie, look at me.

45:01.208 --> 45:03.541
- Mm?
- It's gonna be okay.

45:03.708 --> 45:06.000

Um. I lied about the Choochie's money.

- Yeah, I know.
- No, no, no, no.

54:24.708 --> 54:27.625
I lied about lying
about the Choochie's money.

54:27.625 --> 54:29.083
It's totally real!

54:29.333 --> 54:31.291
I'm getting a giant check,
just like on TV.

- But...

54:33.541 --> 54:35.833
I'm sorry.
Uh. Wh... what are you saying?

54:35.833 --> 54:40.541
Oh, I knew that the only way
that you would do this is if you thought

54:40.541 --> 54:42.291
it was the only way.

54:43.958 --> 54:45.041
Life coaching.

54:45.041 --> 54:50.208
Yeah, but we could've paid off the debt
and I could have Linguini back.

54:50.625 --> 54:52.708
Yeah, but I told you
that the money hasn't come in yet.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Oh, my God!

54:54.625 --> 54:57.000
- Even your lies are lies.
- I'm not lying.

54:57.583 --> 54:58.791
You always do this.

54:58.958 --> 55:01.541
You don't think
about the consequences of your actions.

55:01.541 --> 55:05.166
Mr. Linguini is everything to me,
and to you, he's just a pawn.

55:05.875 --> 55:08.041
- I thought you were trying to help me.
- I am.

55:08.041 --> 55:11.875
I'm helping you get him back
while also seizing your destiny!

55:11.875 --> 55:16.250
- Oh, my God, destiny isn't real!
- Yes, it is. We all have a purpose.

55:16.250 --> 55:17.375
We just need to find it.

55:17.375 --> 55:19.625
No. See, that's just a lie
that you tell yourself

55:19.625 --> 55:21.875
because you're just chasing
these stupid dreams,

55:21.875 --> 55:23.916
then blaming whatever you can
when they don't work out.

55:23.916 --> 55:28.208
But the truth is, it's you.
You're selfish. You're reckless.

55:28.708 --> 55:31.083
- You are just like Mom!
- Don't say that!

55:32.500 --> 55:34.875
Just take some responsibility
for your life.

55:34.875 --> 55:36.750
Stop being such a goddamn loser.

55:42.458 --> 55:43.875
You're the loser!

55:44.375 --> 55:46.333
- Yes, I am lonely and currently unhoused...

55:46.458 --> 55:49.041
...and my life hasn't turned out
exactly the way I wanted.

55:49.458 --> 55:52.875
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to be an Asian woman in this country?

55:54.250 --> 55:56.416
- Oh, my God!
-  But at least I've lived!

55:56.416 --> 55:57.625
What have you done with your life?

55:57.750 --> 55:59.500
I mean, you just, like,
hide out in your robot house

55:59.500 --> 56:01.625
just while watching the <i>Quiz,</i>
watching the <i>Quiz.</i>

56:01.750 --> 56:04.458
Yeah, and take care of Mom
and lend you money, and support myself.

56:04.458 --> 56:06.583
I am responsible for everything!

56:06.583 --> 56:09.541
- Excuse me, ladies, if you don't mind--
- Fuck off, Ben Franklin!

56:09.708 --> 56:11.750
- I absolutely will.

56:11.958 --> 56:14.041
You're the older sister,
you're supposed to help me.

56:14.250 --> 56:17.500
But you never have, you were never there.
All you care about is yourself!

56:17.666 --> 56:20.083
That is not true.
I was always looking out for you.

56:20.791 --> 56:21.791
Yeah? When?

56:21.791 --> 56:25.000
In Burbank!
When you shit in the goddamn hole!

56:27.166 --> 56:29.166
You didn't bury it deep enough.

56:30.125 --> 56:31.208
<i>So, the next day,</i>

56:31.333 --> 56:33.208
<i>when So-Yung and Na-Yung
and I got back from Starbucks...</i>

56:33.208 --> 56:35.291
Appa said you can live with us
and you can come with me

56:35.291 --> 56:36.708
to UCLA next year!

56:36.708 --> 56:38.875
- And we can start our fashion line!
- Yeah!

56:38.875 --> 56:39.958
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Jenny!

56:39.958 --> 56:41.166
Uh. Guys.

56:41.458 --> 56:45.333
- Come here. You gotta see this.
-  <i>Cousin Jin found it.</i>

56:45.958 --> 56:48.708
-  Ew!
-  Tiger, did you do this?

56:49.000 --> 56:52.875
- How could that come out of Tiger?
-  Well, then who did it?

56:54.416 --> 56:55.750
<i>I knew right away it was you.</i>

56:58.500 --> 57:01.041
<i>And it was just a matter of time
before they figured it out.</i>

57:04.750 --> 57:07.833
<i>So, I told them I did it.</i>

57:10.291 --> 57:13.083
Ew!

57:15.125 --> 57:17.666
Uncle Joon was gonna let us live
with them in Burbank

57:17.666 --> 57:21.791
'cause Mom was, like, on a bender.
But everything changed after that.

57:22.875 --> 57:25.708
I mean, do... do you know how insane
an 18-year-old would have to be

57:25.708 --> 57:27.208
to shit in a hole?

57:29.541 --> 57:30.791
Why didn't you tell me?

57:32.500 --> 57:33.666
Because you were eight.

57:39.625 --> 57:42.000
- Asshole!

57:54.958 --> 57:58.416
Anne, where is my 100 bucks?

58:00.208 --> 58:03.916
-  Anne...

58:05.375 --> 58:07.791
You... you... you... you wanna come in?

58:08.291 --> 58:10.041
-  Come on.

58:18.875 --> 58:20.583
-  Here.

58:25.375 --> 58:28.000
I didn't know
you were a Pee-wee Herman fan.

58:28.916 --> 58:30.500
Who the hell is Pee-wee Herman?

58:31.375 --> 58:32.416
P-- Uh.

58:33.875 --> 58:38.666
That's Alan Cumming from <i>The Good Wife.</i>
Such a wonderful actor.

58:38.666 --> 58:42.333
And that Scottish accent of his.

58:43.041 --> 58:45.708
That's not Alan Cumming,
that's P-- That's Paul Reubens.

58:45.708 --> 58:48.791
He plays Pee-wee... Herman.

58:48.791 --> 58:53.125
I think I would know
who my favorite actor is,

58:53.125 --> 58:56.791
thank you very much. That is Alan Cumming.

58:58.125 --> 58:59.208
Mm-hmm.

59:01.625 --> 59:03.833
So, what's wrong with you?

59:05.333 --> 59:06.375
I just...

59:08.208 --> 59:09.416
I thought I was happy.

59:10.500 --> 59:11.541
And maybe I wasn't.

59:12.666 --> 59:15.583
I've just been so scared.

59:16.333 --> 59:21.166
You know, scared of... of being judged,
being laughed at.

59:22.166 --> 59:25.458
When I was younger,
I wasted so much energy

59:25.583 --> 59:27.541
trying to get people to like me.

59:28.666 --> 59:30.916
And for what? Hmm?

59:31.625 --> 59:35.708
So, I could get invited
to some potluck dinner party?

59:35.708 --> 59:39.958
- And terrible games of charades?
- Ugh. I hate charades.

59:39.958 --> 59:44.750
Oh, I love charades.
I am an excellent guesser.

59:45.083 --> 59:48.750
So long as the person who's acting out
the clues is not a total imbecile,

59:48.750 --> 59:50.791
- which they usually are.

59:50.916 --> 59:52.625
I've been alive a long time.

59:53.666 --> 59:55.083
I've met a lot of people.

59:56.500 --> 59:57.750
I only liked one.

59:59.958 --> 01:00:00.958
Was it me?

01:00:02.208 --> 01:00:04.666
No. You get too much mail.

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:11.250
The point is...
...you don't want to waste time

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:14.333
looking for happiness in other people...

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.250
because happiness...

01:00:18.791 --> 01:00:22.500
happiness... does not exist.

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:25.791
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:28.875
Oh! <i>Judge Judy.</i>

01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:31.500
<i>Next up,
she's the voice you trust.</i>

01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:42.500

<i>We wanna put Anne on</i> Can't Stop the Quiz.
<i>Can she fly out ASAP?</i>

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.916
Um. I'm sorry.
I'm no longer part of her journey.

01:00:49.916 --> 01:00:53.041
So, you'll have to call her directly.

01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:55.666
<i>Um. I'm sorry, journey?
Where is she go...</i>

01:01:04.083 --> 01:01:06.916
- Internal auditing.

<i>Hi! Is this Anne Yum?</i>

01:01:10.791 --> 01:01:11.791
Yes.

01:01:11.791 --> 01:01:13.750
<i>This is Mercedes from the</i> Quiz.

<i>Great news!
We'd love to have you on the show!</i>

01:01:15.916 --> 01:01:18.708
<i>- Any chance you could fly out tonight?</i>
- Tonight?

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:20.916
- Okay. You’re gonna regret...
-  <i>Yeah, I know it's last minute...</i>

01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:22.208

<i>...but we'd love to capitalize

I can't really hear you.
Hold on one sec.

01:01:25.875 --> 01:01:29.041
- Oh, my God. Obsessed with the neti pot.
- I got you one for Christmas for a reason.

01:01:29.041 --> 01:01:30.125
- God!

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:33.833
Uh. Do you guys, like, have to eat here?
Or, like, is there another...

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.916
- This is our spot, Fran.
- Yeah, it's kinda great.

01:01:36.916 --> 01:01:38.541
‘Cause then the food smell
stays over here,

01:01:38.541 --> 01:01:40.250
- not at our desks.
- Yeah. I know, I know.

01:01:40.375 --> 01:01:41.875
- No one's here, like...
-  Yeah.

I'm so sorry about that.
I just had-- Sorry, one second. I just...

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:54.375
Like, I'm, like, dripping,
my back is dripping sweat.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.583
- Hey!

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:01.833
I am sick of being treated
like some silent, invisible man.

01:02:01.833 --> 01:02:05.916

- the nationwide chain.

- Oh, my God, you're so sweaty.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.208
- You're just like your mom.

01:04:55.375 --> 01:04:57.833
- That crazy crying. That screaming.
-  No, no, no!

01:04:57.833 --> 01:05:00.041
You really think you're gonna bail her out
with that same bullshit?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.250
I am not my mom.
And I am not here for her.

01:05:06.416 --> 01:05:07.625
I'm here for Anne,

01:05:07.625 --> 01:05:11.083
and that dog has been
by her side for the last 20 years.

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:13.458
- What? How old is he?
- Old!

01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:17.750
Yes, Annie is an anxious,
sweaty little weirdo,

01:05:18.041 --> 01:05:21.000
but she is my sister. And she needs me.

01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:24.583
So, I need that dog.

01:05:27.541 --> 01:05:29.333
Just like you need my money.

01:05:29.666 --> 01:05:32.125
- Oh, I've done my research, right?

01:05:32.125 --> 01:05:34.375
- We Asians like our research, right?

01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:38.791
And you're, like, what,
six months behind on rent? [chuckles] Oh.

01:05:38.791 --> 01:05:42.208
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
Did you... did you boys not know?

01:05:44.958 --> 01:05:50.083
Shame. Where did all of the money go, hmm?
Up your nose? On your tats?

01:05:50.083 --> 01:05:52.083
- In your man buns?
- It's the dogs.

01:05:54.125 --> 01:05:56.500
These people, they're monsters.

01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:59.041
Half of them never come back
for their dogs.

01:05:59.041 --> 01:06:01.875
Oh, and the purebreds,
they have issues, you know?

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:05.625
Skin problems,
kidney problems, anxiety.

01:06:06.041 --> 01:06:08.916
My poor Crispy over there
needs constant attention or he gets sad.

01:06:08.916 --> 01:06:12.000
- I'm all they've got.

01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:17.708
Give me back Linguini, and when my big,
fat Choochie's check comes in,

01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:19.708
I'll solve all your money problems.

01:06:21.375 --> 01:06:22.583
Do we have a deal?

01:06:22.916 --> 01:06:26.041
-  Nope.

01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:29.625
She took my dog!

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:32.666
<i>♪ Shake that brass ♪</i>

01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:37.500
<i>- ♪ Hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho ♪
- ♪ Yeah, uh-huh ♪</i>

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.750
<i>- ♪ Yeah ♪
- ♪ Hey, ho... ♪</i>

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:43.791
Get them, you idiots!
That's my dog! Porky! Porky!

01:06:49.458 --> 01:06:50.458
Francine!

01:06:52.291 --> 01:06:55.416
Jesus! Why is this going so fast?
A person could get killed in this.

01:06:55.416 --> 01:06:57.708
- Gotta keep up.
- Okay, all right.

01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:00.333
Francine.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.125
Hi. I... have a plus one.

01:07:07.125 --> 01:07:09.208
So glad you all found the place okay.

01:07:09.208 --> 01:07:11.750
Now, if you'll follow me,
I'll show you to the green room.

01:07:11.875 --> 01:07:14.416
I don't care what color it is
as long as there's a chair in it.

01:07:14.416 --> 01:07:18.875
For sure. And, Anne,
we're gonna get you into hair and makeup.

01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:23.666
Isn't that amazing?

01:07:23.666 --> 01:07:25.083
You know he's never worn
the same one twice.

01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:26.833
-  <i>What is the lightest element...</i>

01:07:26.833 --> 01:07:28.791
-  I want a divorce!
<i>- ...on the periodic table?</i>

01:07:30.208 --> 01:07:33.458
What? You've never seen a tie before?
Let's go.

01:07:36.416 --> 01:07:37.625
<i>We're on in ten.</i>

01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:39.375
You're all mic'd up.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.291
-  Getting closer, people.

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:42.416
Getting closer.

01:07:45.166 --> 01:07:48.458
Get away from my makeup.
Just kidding. Hi, I'm Ron. How are you?

01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:50.166
Nice to meet you. I'd shake your hand but...

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.583
- Anyway. How was your flight? Great?

01:07:52.583 --> 01:07:55.875
- Great. Listen, I want to apologize.
-  Big night, Ron.

01:07:56.083 --> 01:07:57.375
-  You got this!
- Why?

01:07:57.583 --> 01:08:01.125
Uh. Well, because-- Well,
you're obviously a huge fan of the show,

01:08:01.125 --> 01:08:03.666
and I just think it's a bummer
that you finally get to be here,

01:08:03.666 --> 01:08:05.916
and tonight's gonna be all about me
winning the 84th game,

01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:09.458
becoming the longest running champion.
I'm very sorry. It's very unfair to you.

01:08:12.208 --> 01:08:13.458
Do you wanna be Terry?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.708
Is that why you're always tryna act nice
'cause you wanna take over the show?

01:08:18.125 --> 01:08:23.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Terry is beloved by the entire world.

01:08:23.291 --> 01:08:25.333
I'd be insane to try to think
I could fill his shoes.

01:08:25.333 --> 01:08:27.458
-  And I'm not pretending to be nice.

01:08:27.458 --> 01:08:29.291
I really am nice. Ask anybody here.

01:08:29.625 --> 01:08:31.583
- I'm nice.
-  Sure thing, Ron.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:33.333
Well, anyhow,
I'll let you get to it.

01:08:33.333 --> 01:08:34.833
I know you gotta get
through hair and makeup.

01:08:34.833 --> 01:08:36.083
I already went through hair and makeup.

01:08:36.083 --> 01:08:39.333
Well, then you missed a spot.
And I'll let you change and, uh--

01:08:39.333 --> 01:08:40.958
Hey! Speak of the devil, or the angel.

01:08:41.333 --> 01:08:43.375
- Hi, Anne. I'm Terry.

01:08:43.708 --> 01:08:45.000
Welcome to the show.

01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:49.916
-  <i>Welcome to the show.</i>

01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:52.458
- Your video was very impressive.
- Freakishly great.

01:08:52.458 --> 01:08:54.000
- Hi, Ron.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.625
Two minutes. Places, everyone.

01:08:55.625 --> 01:08:58.208
- Okay, see you on stage.
- Thank you.

01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:01.333
Remember, we're here
to learn and have fun.

01:09:01.333 --> 01:09:02.625
Don't worry about winning.

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:06.375
I have to win to save my dog.

01:09:09.083 --> 01:09:11.750
I have no idea what that means,
but I'll see you out there!

01:09:14.166 --> 01:09:16.291
Here he is, folks, Terry McTeer.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.916
We love you, Terry!

01:09:32.916 --> 01:09:35.666
Hello, folks. Ready to learn
and have some fun?

01:09:35.666 --> 01:09:37.833
- Come on up.

01:09:38.916 --> 01:09:41.500
Places, everybody. Places.

01:09:48.333 --> 01:09:50.375
-  We love you!
-  You got this!

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:51.833
- All right!
- Yes!

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.875
Standby lights to half.

01:10:02.041 --> 01:10:06.166
It's seven o'clock on a weeknight,
you know what that means. It's time for...

01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:08.583
<i>Can't Stop the Quiz!</i>

01:10:10.166 --> 01:10:13.125
Come on, Quiz Lady. Let's do this.

01:10:15.916 --> 01:10:17.750
Godspeed, Miss Yum.

01:10:18.416 --> 01:10:20.875
I swear, they changed the breading
on these mozzarella sticks again.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.875
-  <i>Let's meet tonight's contestants.</i>
- Shit!

01:10:25.458 --> 01:10:28.916
Of course, we all know
our returning champion, Ron Heacock,

01:10:28.916 --> 01:10:30.833
who's going for the record tonight.

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:32.791
- Oh, is that tonight?

01:10:33.166 --> 01:10:34.875
And I see you've stolen my look.

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:37.458
Well, it's a big night, Terry.
I wanted to honor you.

01:10:37.583 --> 01:10:39.000
-  Aw!
- Well, thank you.

01:10:39.125 --> 01:10:41.791
Also, joining us tonight
is someone you might recognize

01:10:41.791 --> 01:10:45.041
from your computers,
the famous Quiz Lady. Welcome, Anne.

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:46.375
Thanks, Dad.

01:10:47.041 --> 01:10:48.291
- I'm sorry?
- What?

01:10:48.958 --> 01:10:51.333
- Welcome.

01:10:51.333 --> 01:10:55.875
And welcome Leah from Guam.
What a journey. Best of luck.

01:10:56.458 --> 01:10:58.125
Let's see tonight's categories.

Music, books, life science, sports,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.666

01:11:03.791 --> 01:11:06.875
- ...food and drink, geology, and language.

01:11:10.583 --> 01:11:13.333
May I have five minutes
on the clock, please?

01:11:13.958 --> 01:11:16.458
- And your time starts now!

01:11:16.458 --> 01:11:18.041
The Striding Man is the logo

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:19.375

-  Oh, no.

01:11:28.583 --> 01:11:29.666
-  Ron?

01:11:29.666 --> 01:11:31.208
Actually, it was Charlotte Brontë.

01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:32.500
- The hot one.

01:11:32.625 --> 01:11:33.708
-  Correct.
- Oh...

01:11:33.708 --> 01:11:35.333
What does an oologist study?

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:36.916
Animals.

01:11:37.166 --> 01:11:38.500
- Oh, no.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.833

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.041

01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:43.458
<i>- You said "oologist" on that one?</i>
-  <i>I did.</i>

01:11:43.458 --> 01:11:46.083
<i>- Oh, I-- ' Cause I heard...</i>
- She's blowing it.

01:11:46.083 --> 01:11:47.958

- Ron. Ron. Ron. Ron.

01:12:08.166 --> 01:12:09.708
Ron's on a hot streak!

01:12:09.916 --> 01:12:12.291
- Come on. Come on.

What qualitative scale
is used to rate minerals

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:19.208

- What is the only mammal that can't...

01:12:31.333 --> 01:12:35.458
Gosh, I guess we'll never know.
That's a shame. I love the animal ones.

01:12:35.875 --> 01:12:38.083
Well, Leah, goodbye.

01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:41.541
When we return,
Ron and Anne will compete head-to-head.

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:44.166
Don't go anywhere, I know I won't.

01:12:44.916 --> 01:12:47.833
-  And we're out.

01:12:47.833 --> 01:12:50.333
 Resetting.
Let's clear the stage for Head to Head.

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:51.875
-  Touch-ups.

01:12:51.875 --> 01:12:55.125
 More contour,
I want tight little piano fingers.

01:12:56.166 --> 01:12:59.375
- Are you okay? You seem deeply unwell.

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:02.541
Get off of me.
I need to get in there.

01:13:02.541 --> 01:13:04.250
- It's an emergency.
-  Hey, lady. Stop!

01:13:04.375 --> 01:13:06.250
- Oh, no.
-  I'll sue you into oblivion.

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:08.541
'Cause he's a service dog
and he keeps me from fainting.

01:13:10.625 --> 01:13:13.250
- Hey...
- Linguini...

01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:15.291
Linguini...

01:13:16.791 --> 01:13:17.833
Come.

01:13:29.708 --> 01:13:31.083
I missed you so much.

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:32.500
- Oh, my boy.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:37.833
Oh. Is that-- Oh, he smells good.
And he seems like he's been eating.

01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:40.833
And I can't...
I can't believe you... you... you... you...

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.041
- ...you got him back.

01:13:42.166 --> 01:13:44.833
And it's so good that you did
because there's no chance I'm winning.

01:13:44.958 --> 01:13:46.791
Quick, create a distraction,
let's do the fries thing.

01:13:46.791 --> 01:13:47.916
- No, no, no.
- Just let me...

01:13:47.916 --> 01:13:49.708
I'm not letting you run away from this.

01:13:49.875 --> 01:13:51.833
You can do this. You know why?

01:13:53.458 --> 01:13:56.125
- Because I'm strong.
- Because you know this game,

01:13:56.375 --> 01:13:58.000
just like you know
literally everything else.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.291
So, play the same way you always have.
Like a winner.

01:14:03.208 --> 01:14:04.791
Thirty seconds, everybody.

01:14:11.041 --> 01:14:13.666
Oh, you smell so good.
You're so cute. You're such a big boy.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.750
You can't have a dog up here. Right?

01:14:18.708 --> 01:14:19.708
Well, uh...

01:14:20.958 --> 01:14:25.416
You know what? I want him with me
and I don't care if that's weird.

01:14:26.041 --> 01:14:28.500
- I-- Is it... is it okay that he's with me?

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:31.458
-  Places, everybody.
- Oh, is it okay-- Gosh, I don't know.

01:14:31.458 --> 01:14:33.291
No one's ever asked that before.

01:14:33.291 --> 01:14:35.166
Uh. Let me ask. Uh. Uh.

01:14:35.291 --> 01:14:38.083
- Glenn, can she have...
-  No! We're live in 15.

01:14:38.083 --> 01:14:39.458
Glenn says "no."

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.125
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye, doggy.

01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:45.333
Um. [pants] Hey, everybody!

01:14:45.333 --> 01:14:49.333
The Quiz Lady should have
her famous Quiz Dog with her, right?

01:14:49.708 --> 01:14:53.333
Quiz Dog! Quiz Dog!
Quiz Dog! Quiz Dog! Quiz Dog!

01:14:53.333 --> 01:14:55.083
- Yeah! Yeah!
-  Quiz Dog! Quiz Dog!

01:14:55.083 --> 01:14:56.750
- Quiz Dog! Quiz Dog!
-  Quiz Dog! Quiz Dog!

01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:59.125
- Quiz Dog! Quiz Dog! Quiz Dog!

01:14:59.125 --> 01:15:00.333
Fine, the dog can stay!

01:15:00.333 --> 01:15:03.541
- Chanting always works.

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:06.083
That was thrilling.
It's like we were in a musical.

01:15:06.291 --> 01:15:07.708
And we're live!

01:15:08.791 --> 01:15:11.750
-  I got Linguini.
- No kidding.

01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:13.083
Welcome back.

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:16.166
For the Head to Head,
we have a special guest joining us.

01:15:16.333 --> 01:15:19.333
- Mr. Linguini. Hello, sir.

01:15:19.791 --> 01:15:22.541
- And thank you for your service.
-  Aw!

01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:25.291
You know, pugs are the official dog
of the House of Orange,

01:15:25.291 --> 01:15:29.416
- in the Netherlands. And in 1572 of--
- Ron, I... I'm sorry. Can't stop the quiz.

01:15:29.416 --> 01:15:31.791
- Can't.
- Please select Anne's first category.

01:15:31.791 --> 01:15:34.833
Hmm. How about sports?

01:15:34.958 --> 01:15:36.083
-  Sports it is.

01:15:36.083 --> 01:15:38.708
Anne, please list for us NFL teams

01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:41.916
- with more than one Super Bowl win.
- Shit.

01:15:42.708 --> 01:15:46.375
-  Your time starts now.

01:15:47.958 --> 01:15:51.875
- Steelers, Patriots, 49ers, Cowboys...

01:15:51.875 --> 01:15:55.208
<i>- ...Giants, Packers,</i>

01:15:55.375 --> 01:15:57.541
- Broncos, Raiders, Chiefs...

01:15:57.541 --> 01:15:59.000
- ...Colts, Ravens,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
- Dolphins, Rams, Washington...

01:16:01.166 --> 01:16:03.791
<i>- ...Buccaneers.</i>

01:16:03.791 --> 01:16:05.875
It's a comeback jawn!

01:16:08.416 --> 01:16:11.166
- All right. Ron, now to you.

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:14.875
Please list for us
the geological eras of Earth.

01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:19.375
- My pleasure. Cenozoic, Mesozoic...

01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:21.375
- ...Paleozoic, Mesoproterozoic...
- What does-- Who cares?

01:16:21.541 --> 01:16:24.291
- ...uh, Neoarchean, Mesoarchean...

01:16:24.291 --> 01:16:25.875
- ...Alan-archean. Just kidding.

01:16:25.875 --> 01:16:28.958
One syllable words with no rhymes. Wow.

01:16:29.416 --> 01:16:32.583
- Whilst, angst, cusp, breadth...

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:35.083
- ...ninth, glimpsed, sculpts...
-  Good.

01:16:35.083 --> 01:16:36.916
<i>- ...Goonch, twelfth.</i>
-"Goonch." Oh...

01:16:38.416 --> 01:16:41.333
God, I wish I had a service dog up here.
Hey, how about it, everybody?

01:16:41.625 --> 01:16:45.375
-  "Ron's dog! Ron's dog!"

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.875
Playable characters in <i>Mario Kart 64.</i>
This is fun.

01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:52.208
- Mario, Luigi...

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:54.666
- ...Princess Peach, for the women...

01:16:54.666 --> 01:16:57.208
- ...Donkey Kong, and uh, Koopa Troopa.

01:16:57.333 --> 01:17:00.541
-  Bowser, moron.
-  You suck, Ron!

01:17:00.541 --> 01:17:02.416
Cruciferous vegetables.

01:17:02.416 --> 01:17:05.458
- Broccoli, cauliflower, horseradish, kale...

01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:07.875
...cabbage, kohlrabi, bok choy.

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:10.375
- Beethoven, Mozart...

01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:12.166
- ...Salieri, Strauss.

01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:14.666
- Right. He's Romantic era,

01:17:14.791 --> 01:17:17.333
which one could argue
still is classical music.

01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:19.541
Anyhow, now, may I, uh...

01:17:20.666 --> 01:17:22.000
- Come here. Oh...

01:17:22.125 --> 01:17:24.000
- Okay.
-  Hmm.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.291
- Hide and seek. Haydn!

01:17:25.291 --> 01:17:26.833
-  It works!

01:17:26.833 --> 01:17:31.416
- Such a jerk.
- And for the bonus round, simple machines.

01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:34.041
- Lever, pulley, wedge, screw...

01:17:34.041 --> 01:17:35.625
...wheel and axle, inclined plane.

01:17:35.625 --> 01:17:39.541
And that's all of them!
You finished with 24 seconds remaining,

01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:41.208
which means you get a bonus

01:17:41.333 --> 01:17:44.875
of 12,000 dollars.
I believe that's a new record.

01:17:45.375 --> 01:17:46.958
- Is that right?
-  Can we check on that?

01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:49.041
-  Yeah.
- Checking. What is that?

01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:50.458
I don't-- It is? It is!

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:52.166
-  That is the highest bonus

01:17:52.166 --> 01:17:53.541
in the history of the show.

01:17:53.541 --> 01:17:55.166
- Way to go, Annie!
-  Congratulations, Anne!

01:17:55.166 --> 01:17:57.750
- Whoo!

01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:59.166
- Oh, huzzah!
-  <i>Thank you.</i>

01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:00.958
What a comeback.

01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:03.041
This is just like
the classic sports film,

01:18:03.041 --> 01:18:06.375
<i>Mighty Ducks 2.</i> "Ducks fly together."

01:18:06.375 --> 01:18:08.000
What a wonderful message.
Have you seen it?

01:18:08.416 --> 01:18:09.958
- I've seen it multiple times.
- Oh...

01:18:09.958 --> 01:18:12.958
Yes, it's in my top ten.
It might be my top two.

01:18:13.458 --> 01:18:14.583
I think it's my number one.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:16.333
Will the comeback continue,

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:20.000
or will another record be broken tonight
by Ron winning his 84th game?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.333
It all depends on the final round.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.250
- Time for the flip.

01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:25.500
Ron, you have the honors.

01:18:29.875 --> 01:18:31.500
Whoo! Flip it!

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:35.458
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:40.916
six, five, four, three, two, one!

01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:46.125
-  Show it!
- Oh...

01:18:46.125 --> 01:18:48.625
- Charades.

01:18:48.625 --> 01:18:53.083
When we return,
Anne and Ron will compete in "Show It."

01:18:53.083 --> 01:18:55.083
-  And we're out.

01:18:55.791 --> 01:18:59.458
"Show It" is where Heacock
becomes a peacock.

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:02.291
Bart.

01:19:02.416 --> 01:19:05.000
- Hmm.
- How are you, buddy?

01:19:05.125 --> 01:19:06.875
- All right, let's get in sync here.
- Okay.

01:19:19.083 --> 01:19:24.583
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:28.375
No, I'm fine.
It just got down the wrong pipe.

01:19:28.375 --> 01:19:29.958
-  Uh-huh.

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:31.791
- I always thought you ate crackers...
-  No.

01:19:31.916 --> 01:19:34.541
- ...between the commercials.
- You caught me.

01:19:35.583 --> 01:19:37.791
My wife, Cecilia,
worries about my sugar intake,

01:19:37.916 --> 01:19:40.250
so, I just... I just say they're crackers.

01:19:40.458 --> 01:19:43.541
What are you hiding from, huh?

01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:48.500
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:19:49.791 --> 01:19:50.875
All those...

01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:53.750
...people watching and...

01:19:54.666 --> 01:19:55.833
I'm gonna lose.

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:05.500
You know...

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.750
...whenever I look
at this bow tie right here,

01:20:07.875 --> 01:20:12.041
it makes me think of one contestant
from that night, Oscar from Texas.

01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:17.541
We had a wonderful conversation
about how he makes his own jams.

01:20:17.541 --> 01:20:20.875
He tries these wild combinations,
like blueberry rhubarb.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.666
What?
And he's like an artist, but with jams.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.958
Oh! This was the night
that Aparna from New Jersey

01:20:30.958 --> 01:20:33.958
played her mandolin for us
during the commercial break.

01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:42.833
And that night, Mike from Maine
brought me a snowball in a cooler

01:20:42.833 --> 01:20:47.208
‘cause he... he remembered that I had said
I... I missed New England winters.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.791
Great guy.
None of them actually won their games.

01:20:51.958 --> 01:20:54.500
You know, like most contestants,
they were just here for one night, but...

01:20:55.291 --> 01:20:57.000
I don't think of them as failures.

01:20:58.833 --> 01:21:00.583
I'm just glad
I got a chance to talk to them,

01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:02.625
and they... they got a chance to play.

01:21:04.958 --> 01:21:08.083
Don't ruin what might be
your only night here

01:21:08.083 --> 01:21:09.958
by making it about winning or losing.

01:21:12.791 --> 01:21:14.916
Just try to think
of what you wanna remember.

01:21:15.791 --> 01:21:16.875
As for me...

01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:18.916
no matter who wins...

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:25.458
this one will always remind me
of Anne from Pennsylvania

01:21:25.666 --> 01:21:26.875
who brought her dog.

01:21:28.041 --> 01:21:31.416
- There you are. We need you on stage.
- Yeah, right away, Glenn.

01:21:31.416 --> 01:21:32.750
- Thank you so much.

01:21:33.583 --> 01:21:35.750
It's Glenn's world
and we're all just living in it, you know?

01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:38.125
-  All right. Ready?

01:21:49.791 --> 01:21:52.875
And legally, you have to allow
service animals, but also,

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.958
- it's the right thing to do, you know?

01:21:55.083 --> 01:21:57.083
And you know what? Not only for Anne,
but for society, as well.

01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:59.541
Sure, it's just that
it's clearly a fake vest, so...

01:21:59.541 --> 01:22:01.625
I know, but what side of history
do you wanna be on?

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.166
Okay,
you can't pull that with me.

01:22:03.166 --> 01:22:06.166
You know what? I think it's probably
gonna be really great for ratings.

01:22:06.166 --> 01:22:07.916
- You know what?
- I wanna change my partner.

01:22:08.375 --> 01:22:09.708
- What?
- What?

01:22:10.041 --> 01:22:11.416
I wanna play with my sister.

01:22:12.333 --> 01:22:14.041
- Jenny.
-  You can't do that.

01:22:14.291 --> 01:22:16.708
- Glenn, it's her game. I think she can.
-  What? Uh.

01:22:16.958 --> 01:22:19.125
You want me to guess?
But I don't know anything.

01:22:20.291 --> 01:22:21.291
You know me.

01:22:21.291 --> 01:22:24.916
And... and win or lose,
we'll... we'll... we'll do it together.

01:22:25.458 --> 01:22:29.250
-  All right. Switch them.
- I came all this way.

01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:31.875
- I know, Fran. I'm so sorry about that.
- Ma'am, this way.

01:22:31.875 --> 01:22:33.958
Um. If I could get you
and Mr. Linguini to a seat?

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:35.666
-  Sorry, Francine.
-  Now, I have to watch

01:22:35.666 --> 01:22:36.625
the rest of this shit.

01:22:36.625 --> 01:22:38.208
She can't do that.
You can't switch partners.

01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:39.375
This is so unfair.

01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:41.666
What are you gonna do next?
Give her all the answers?

01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:43.208
- Welcome back.

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:44.833
I hope you enjoyed your break.

01:22:45.041 --> 01:22:48.083
Joining us for the final round
is Ron's friend, Bart,

01:22:48.666 --> 01:22:51.083
and Anne's sister--
I'm sorry, I never got your name.

01:22:51.208 --> 01:22:52.291
Oh, Jenny.

01:22:52.416 --> 01:22:54.458
-  <i>Hi, Jenny, I'm Terry.</i>
- Oh, hello, Satan.

01:22:54.583 --> 01:22:57.750
Ron and Bart are up first,
so we'll ask Anne and Jenny

01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:59.625
to step on the "Show It" coin.

01:23:00.458 --> 01:23:03.208
Gentlemen, take your places.
Best of luck.

01:23:03.458 --> 01:23:04.666
I'm ready, Terry.

01:23:05.166 --> 01:23:09.083
- And your time starts now.

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:13.333
- Book. Magazine. Mag.

01:23:15.958 --> 01:23:19.666
- Shopping. Cart. Mag.
- He's good.

01:23:19.666 --> 01:23:21.333
- Cart. Magna Carta. Hmm.

01:23:21.333 --> 01:23:23.041
- What's the Magna Carta?

01:23:23.666 --> 01:23:26.125
Sky. Space.

01:23:27.166 --> 01:23:28.333
- Dog.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:30.500
- Shut up!

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:31.708
-  Stay.

01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:34.125
- Shun.

01:23:34.125 --> 01:23:35.708
Space. Stay.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
- Shun. International Space Station.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.041
- How... how's that possible?

01:23:41.791 --> 01:23:43.791
-  Africa.
-"Africa"?

01:23:44.208 --> 01:23:45.541
- Morocco.

01:23:45.541 --> 01:23:47.208


01:23:47.208 --> 01:23:48.666
- Kombucha!
-  Apple cider vinegar.

01:23:48.666 --> 01:23:50.041
- Oh.

01:23:51.291 --> 01:23:54.166
Woman. Thatch. Margaret Thatcher.

01:23:54.166 --> 01:23:56.208
- Hmm.

01:23:56.333 --> 01:23:57.833
And that's your time.

01:23:57.833 --> 01:24:01.500
Ron, you got seven correct,
which brings your total

01:24:01.875 --> 01:24:04.541
- to a whopping 61,000.

01:24:04.541 --> 01:24:06.583
- Whoo! Heck yeah, bro. Whoo!
-  Hmm.

01:24:06.916 --> 01:24:08.750
But one thing stands
between you and victory.

01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:11.583
Well, actually two, Anne and Jenny.

01:24:11.583 --> 01:24:13.375
-  Oh, boy.
-  Come on up. Let's switch places.

01:24:13.375 --> 01:24:15.625
- Beat that.

01:24:15.625 --> 01:24:17.625
- Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:24:17.625 --> 01:24:19.083
-  What? What?
-  Hmm.

01:24:19.208 --> 01:24:20.958
-  Anne? Jenny?

01:24:21.125 --> 01:24:23.791
- Yeah?
- You need at least nine in order to win.

01:24:23.958 --> 01:24:26.875
- Okay.
-  And your time starts now.

01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:35.125
Okay, okay, okay, thinking, thinking.

01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:38.125
Um. Um. A gathering. Uh.
You have a-- You... you... you have some--

01:24:38.125 --> 01:24:40.916
Uh. A... an ear... ear...
ear... earache, earring, earring.

01:24:40.916 --> 01:24:43.875
A gun in my ear? Earring gun.
"I can't hear," you're deaf.

01:24:43.875 --> 01:24:47.166
Uh. Okay, not-- No. Don't-- Not that.
Um. A flying... a flying duck.

01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:49.375
A duck... a duck. Uh.
Something is moving. What?

01:24:49.875 --> 01:24:52.833
What? Do... do something else.
You're in jail, you can't get out.

01:24:52.833 --> 01:24:54.166
You're The Hamburglar.

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.833
- This is pathetic.

01:24:55.833 --> 01:24:57.625
-  Do something else!

01:24:57.833 --> 01:24:59.000
Just do something else!

01:25:01.125 --> 01:25:03.125
Uh. It's a...

01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:06.041
- Uncle Dong?

01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:08.958
Okay, Uncle Dong, Uncle Dong.
Uncle-- Stock market.

01:25:10.041 --> 01:25:14.166
Um.
Okay. Um. Me? Me? Praying.

01:25:14.166 --> 01:25:17.000
I'm praying, I'm praying. Uh-huh. Okay.

01:25:17.291 --> 01:25:19.166
- And Kristi Yamaguchi!
- Yes.

01:25:19.166 --> 01:25:20.250
- Yes.

01:25:21.708 --> 01:25:25.083
Looking at a house.
Okay, me, me, me, me.

01:25:26.125 --> 01:25:27.375
- Ketchup!

01:25:27.541 --> 01:25:29.000
- What?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.041
Uh. Gross, gross.
You, me, gross. Oh! The Beatles.

01:25:33.041 --> 01:25:37.000
- Yeah. Okay, uh, you, uh, banana.

01:25:38.208 --> 01:25:40.750
-  Glue stick! Glue stick!

01:25:40.958 --> 01:25:43.625
Oh, yeah, that's... that's me!
That's cheesecake!

01:25:44.333 --> 01:25:45.375
I like it too.

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.791
Uh. The... the sad dog
from, uh, <i>Homeward Bound.</i>

01:25:48.166 --> 01:25:49.375
- Shadow. Yes! Yes!

01:25:51.375 --> 01:25:52.666
- Taking out the trash!

01:25:52.666 --> 01:25:53.791


01:25:54.333 --> 01:25:56.083
-  Yes!
- That... that was good.

01:25:56.083 --> 01:25:57.583
- Very good.

01:25:57.583 --> 01:25:59.166
Come on, Quiz Lady!

01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:01.250
One more.

01:26:01.375 --> 01:26:02.416
Okay.

01:26:02.541 --> 01:26:06.666
You are just, uh, so flinging.
Oh, you're gonna be strong.

01:26:06.666 --> 01:26:10.750
You are-- Muscle. Muscle. Muscle.
You're like muscle... muscle lady.

01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:15.166
Muscle. What? Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Muscle. A bra-- A breastplate. Breast. Uh.

01:26:15.166 --> 01:26:19.541
Uh. You're like a tiger woman.
Oh! You... you're swimming. What is this?

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:22.541
Uh. Oh! Oh, yes. Uh. Okay, okay.
I'm sweating, I'm sweating.

01:26:22.916 --> 01:26:26.333
Okay. Okay. You, you, you.

01:26:27.625 --> 01:26:30.750
You are... [pants] ...digging a hole.

01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:33.708
Digging a hole,
digging a hole, digging a hole.

01:26:33.916 --> 01:26:34.916
And you...

01:26:37.041 --> 01:26:38.041
shit in a hole?

01:26:38.208 --> 01:26:40.083
- Uh. Sh... shoot in a hole?

01:26:40.291 --> 01:26:45.916
Shoot in a hole? Shoot in a hole.
Okay. Me. Me and, uh, you.

01:26:45.916 --> 01:26:47.708
You, me.

01:26:49.375 --> 01:26:50.916
You. You.

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:53.375
Me.

01:26:56.041 --> 01:26:57.583
- Hero?

01:27:05.166 --> 01:27:06.625
-  And time's up.

01:27:06.625 --> 01:27:09.375
- We have a new champion.

01:27:09.875 --> 01:27:11.291
- Whoo!

01:27:11.416 --> 01:27:12.750
Quiz Lady is my best friend.

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:16.833
-  My God!
- No! No! No!

01:27:17.416 --> 01:27:19.500
I'm very sorry, Terry.
I'm very sorry to do this, everybody.

01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:21.291
- She cheated.
- What?

01:27:21.291 --> 01:27:23.958
You brought in a dog,
you changed partners at the last second.

01:27:23.958 --> 01:27:26.250
They use some kind
of ancient Chinese mind meld.

01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:29.208
-  Actual racism.
- Just be honest with me, Terry.

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:30.500
You're threatened by me.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.625
You wanted me to lose?
He wanted me to lose.

01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:34.000
- Just lose with honor.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.208
I can't... I can't... I can't. I am exciting.
I'm fresh. I'm popping. I'm young.

01:27:39.208 --> 01:27:43.541
- And you're just a boring old man.

01:27:43.541 --> 01:27:44.833
-  Acting like you invented...

01:27:44.833 --> 01:27:46.666
...the bow tie.

01:27:46.666 --> 01:27:47.833
<i>I'll keep going.</i>

01:27:47.833 --> 01:27:49.791
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

01:27:49.916 --> 01:27:51.416
- Yeah, I will say--
- I think you should stop.

01:27:51.708 --> 01:27:54.208
In fact, I think you should buzz off, Ron.

01:27:57.625 --> 01:27:59.958
- Ooh!
- Would a boring old man say that?

01:28:00.791 --> 01:28:03.750
Congratulations, Anne,
you're our new Quiz Champion!

01:28:11.791 --> 01:28:12.833
I'm sorry, Terry.

01:28:15.583 --> 01:28:16.916
No. I... I-- Yeah.

01:28:18.708 --> 01:28:20.208
Anne! Anne! Anne!

01:28:20.333 --> 01:28:21.875
-  Anne! Anne! Anne!
-  Join us tomorrow

01:28:21.875 --> 01:28:24.833
for another night of fast facts
and live learning.

01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:27.916
I'm Terry McTeer, and I'll be right-- Oh!

01:28:28.083 --> 01:28:29.958
I'll be right here.

01:28:30.333 --> 01:28:31.458
Have a good night.

01:28:32.291 --> 01:28:35.958
You did it!

01:28:36.166 --> 01:28:37.375
- We did it.
- Win! Win!

01:28:37.375 --> 01:28:39.416
- You bring me all this way...

01:28:39.416 --> 01:28:42.500
...on the promise that I might get
a chance to play charades...

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:45.708
- ...and it was all just a... charade.

01:28:45.708 --> 01:28:48.333
Hey, if you're gonna be this miserable,
can you just, like, die?

01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:50.000
- Don't.
- 'Cause you're ruining her moment.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.750
Oh, moment. Look at the two of you,
running around, searching for happiness.

01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:57.333
It's just deranged.

01:28:57.333 --> 01:29:00.666
Just accept the fact that nothing
will make life better.

01:29:00.833 --> 01:29:03.875
- Life is, and always has been a... a...

01:29:04.541 --> 01:29:06.833
...a miracle.

01:29:21.666 --> 01:29:24.916
It's... it's... it's... it's, uh, it... it's...

01:29:24.916 --> 01:29:26.625
- Who?
-  So sorry to bother you.

01:29:26.625 --> 01:29:28.958
- She's a huge fan of yours.

01:29:29.083 --> 01:29:31.541
Uh. Maybe you can give her
a ride in your golf cart.

01:29:35.333 --> 01:29:38.791
- Uh.
- Sh... she's gonna die soon.

01:29:39.041 --> 01:29:41.041
- And she has this horrible disease...
- It's...

01:29:41.166 --> 01:29:44.416
...where her intestines grow
like an invasive weed. It's everywhere.

01:29:44.583 --> 01:29:46.333
- They kinda--
- Yeah, yeah, fine. Hop in.

01:29:46.458 --> 01:29:47.458
- She also thinks

01:29:47.458 --> 01:29:49.500
you're the Scottish actor, Alan Cumming.
Just play along with that.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.833
You're excellent
in <i>The Good Wife.</i>

01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:55.583
You're so, so excellent.

01:29:57.041 --> 01:30:00.708
- Ooh! What a bonnie lass.
-  Oh, my God!

01:30:01.791 --> 01:30:03.375
- Who was that?
-  Play that bagpipe!

01:30:03.375 --> 01:30:07.791
- Not Alan Cumming.
-  Oh, me pot o' gold. Lucky Charms!

01:30:07.791 --> 01:30:11.958
That was a bloody good pudding.
Glengarry...

01:30:15.875 --> 01:30:20.875
Oh! Look at it.
Oh! It's so beautiful.

01:30:24.958 --> 01:30:26.583
Where's Burbank from here?

01:30:27.083 --> 01:30:29.833
I think it's over there by the mountains.

01:30:30.416 --> 01:30:31.458
Wow!

01:30:32.125 --> 01:30:34.333
I always thought my destiny was out there.

01:30:34.916 --> 01:30:36.083
Maybe it is.

01:30:37.333 --> 01:30:38.333
Nah.

01:30:39.833 --> 01:30:40.833
It's just Burbank.

01:30:44.791 --> 01:30:46.958
I'm sorry, I left you to deal with Mom.

01:30:49.916 --> 01:30:53.208
I'm sorry, I ruined our chance of living
with the cool cousins.

01:30:53.208 --> 01:30:55.250
- That was not your fault.
- It was.

01:30:55.250 --> 01:30:57.458
I mean, they always thought
we were the losers of the family.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.041
We kind of were.

01:31:01.375 --> 01:31:02.500
Not today.

01:31:04.166 --> 01:31:07.833
- You're right. Not today.

01:31:07.833 --> 01:31:09.333
- Not today!
- Not today!

01:31:09.458 --> 01:31:10.958
- Motherfuckers!
- Oh, okay.

01:31:18.083 --> 01:31:21.916
- I love you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-  Look, geese, geese!

01:31:23.708 --> 01:31:25.208
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

01:31:26.916 --> 01:31:28.041
I love you, Jenny.

01:31:33.166 --> 01:31:34.541
I love you, Annie.

01:31:37.166 --> 01:31:38.208
Thank you.

01:31:38.416 --> 01:31:40.833
- Did you just say, "Thank you"?
- What? Yeah. Why?

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.625
Come here. Come here,
I'm touching you now.

01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:45.416
- No!
- You can't help it.

01:31:48.125 --> 01:31:49.500
I'm so proud of you.

01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:54.375
Okay.

01:31:55.666 --> 01:31:59.125
You know, I, uh, I'm gonna have
to stay in California for a while.

01:31:59.583 --> 01:32:01.708
Oh! Look at the glow up.

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:04.833
Would you wanna stay with me?

01:32:05.708 --> 01:32:08.375
Just ‘cause I feel like
we make a pretty good team.

01:32:09.416 --> 01:32:11.541
Uh. Yeah! We do!

01:32:12.166 --> 01:32:15.416
Oh. I can finally,
like, coordinate our outfits.

01:32:15.416 --> 01:32:18.000
I have the most amazing sleeveless blazer,
it's chartreuse.

01:32:18.125 --> 01:32:19.833
- No.
-  It would be very slimming.

01:32:19.833 --> 01:32:21.791
-  I don't like sleeveless.
-  All you have to do

01:32:21.791 --> 01:32:23.458
- is some pushups.
-  What do you mean?

01:32:23.458 --> 01:32:25.125
You should work
on your arms a little bit.

01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:27.208
Are you trying to say
that I'm out of shape or something?

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:28.291
Yeah.

01:32:42.708 --> 01:32:44.416
I can't look at-- Leave it. No, no.

01:32:44.416 --> 01:32:47.416
Let me have it, you go away,
and let me look at it by myself.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.208
