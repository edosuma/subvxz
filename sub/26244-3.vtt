at our house, and he's lost his memory!

You just found a raven.

is a statue of a bald, bearded man with--

12:50.478 --> 12:54.190
-Oh, no! [shouting]
-[cats yowling]

12:55.483 --> 12:57.443
[Hilda] How do you find
your way around here?

12:57.526 --> 12:59.779
Every street looks exactly alike.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.072
You know, some people
think that about rocks.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.658
That's crazy!
Every rock is different.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.827
Well, the city is like that, too.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.413
Take those houses, for example.
Look at the doors.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.540
That one's a nice deep red,

13:12.124 --> 13:14.877
and that one's white
with windows on it and a knocker.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.631
And that one's rustic with a wood finish,
which I quite like.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.007
I see what you mean.

13:20.090 --> 13:23.052
They're similar,
but they've all got their own personality.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.887
And that's just the start.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.681
There's different chimneys and lampposts.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.976
And different cars
and plants breaking out of the pavement.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.937
See? You're getting it already.

13:33.020 --> 13:36.941
Uh, don't get me wrong, Trolberg's
still less interesting than a rock,

13:37.483 --> 13:38.776
but it's close.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.404
I think we're almost at the statue.
Come on!

13:43.113 --> 13:44.782
[whimpering, panting]

13:44.865 --> 13:47.868
-Oof! [whimpering]
-[yowling]

13:47.952 --> 13:50.037
Sorry. Pardon me.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.205
[grunting]

13:51.288 --> 13:54.458
-[yowling]
-[Alfur] Oh, that was a close call.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.086
Yeah, but now we're totally lost.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.297
We'll never find that statue!

14:00.381 --> 14:02.424
Now, now, don't lose heart.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.261
Oh, where's your friend, the girl?

14:05.344 --> 14:06.637
We need help.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.182
-Helga! Helga!
-It's Hilda, actually.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.018
Uh, sorry, I'm bad with names... I think.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.188
Actually, I have no idea
whether I'm bad with names.

14:16.814 --> 14:17.898
Zelda!

14:17.982 --> 14:19.358
So you can talk!

14:19.441 --> 14:20.901
-What? No, I can't.
-Shh!

14:20.985 --> 14:23.737
-[muffled squawk]
-I'll show everyone I'm not crazy.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.573
[Hilda panting]

14:27.783 --> 14:31.036
[Hilda] He's not here.
He must not have been able to find it.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.206
Now what?

14:34.290 --> 14:35.666
[bell tolling]

14:38.002 --> 14:40.087
Ah! [panting]

14:43.674 --> 14:45.926
[crowd murmuring]

14:46.510 --> 14:47.678
Where's the Great Raven?

14:47.761 --> 14:49.263
He's usually here by now.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.600
See, if we want to figure out
where a bird would go...

14:54.018 --> 14:56.812
we should look at the city
the way a bird does.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.188
Ah! Good thinking.

15:03.193 --> 15:07.740
Wow, from up here,
the city is, well, kind of beautiful.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.659
Yes, it is.

15:11.785 --> 15:15.456
I know you miss the wilderness, Hilda,
but I promise,

15:15.539 --> 15:18.250
Trolberg is a pretty cool place
to grow up, too.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.252
I liked it, anyway.

15:22.504 --> 15:23.881
I'm sure it'll be great.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.384
Sorry if I've been a bit of a brat.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.555
And I'm sorry I put the raven out.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.767
It's okay.
I should have told you about it.

15:34.850 --> 15:38.187
But I know you don't like me
making friends with creatures.

15:38.270 --> 15:42.816
Hilda, I love that you can make friends
with all manner of things.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.903
I just think you ought to be open
to befriending humans as well.

15:45.986 --> 15:49.949
I am, but those kids
just weren't a good fit.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.992
They threw rocks at birds, Mum.

15:52.576 --> 15:56.205
Hmm. In that case,
I'm proud of you for not making friends.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.374
[Hilda chuckles]

16:01.919 --> 16:03.879
[Trevor] I'm telling you, I'm not crazy.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.464
This bird talks.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.049
Go on, show them!

16:07.132 --> 16:09.510
What's that?
Trevor's lost his marbles?

16:09.593 --> 16:11.762
Yeah, I think you're right!
[laughing, snorting]

16:11.845 --> 16:13.263
[others laughing]

16:19.645 --> 16:20.729
Get back here!

16:21.313 --> 16:22.147
[grunts]

16:23.023 --> 16:25.234
[wailing] Get off!

16:25.943 --> 16:27.945
[grunting]

16:28.028 --> 16:30.739
What's happening?
[grunting]

16:31.740 --> 16:34.159
[all laughing]

16:34.243 --> 16:36.203
[shouting]

16:43.961 --> 16:46.088
Never mind.
You're all terrible!

16:48.966 --> 16:51.343
You made me look like an idiot back there.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.264
[Hilda] Hey, it's Trevor.

16:55.764 --> 16:58.100
[gasps]
And he's got the raven with him!

16:58.183 --> 17:01.645
-[lens close]
-No, no, no, no! I can't lose them now!

17:01.729 --> 17:02.563
Ugh!

17:03.230 --> 17:04.356
Oh, phew!

17:04.440 --> 17:05.524
[coin clinks]

17:06.400 --> 17:07.818
Uh, there they are!

17:09.570 --> 17:11.572
He's the one
who hit the raven with the rock.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.073
He can't be trusted.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.993
[Mum] He's headed
for the Bronstad Lane Footbridge.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.161
I know a shortcut.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.043
[crowd murmuring]

17:24.126 --> 17:26.962
Oh, cruddlesticks!
The raven didn't come.

17:27.504 --> 17:29.381
What's going to happen now?

17:29.465 --> 17:33.510
I don't know, but a Sparrow Scout
is prepared for anything.

17:33.594 --> 17:38.891
Flashlight, water, matches,
camping knife, and rations for three days.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.517
Can I share your rations?

17:44.063 --> 17:47.524
I'm afraid it's every woman for herself
in these dark times.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.027
[crowd murmuring]

17:50.110 --> 17:52.112
[both panting]

17:56.575 --> 17:57.659
[birds chirping]

17:57.743 --> 17:58.577
This way!

17:59.161 --> 18:00.454
Right behind you, Mum!

18:06.668 --> 18:08.378
[laughing] Go, Mum!

18:11.340 --> 18:13.383
Talk, you!
Why won't you talk?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.010
Why did you embarrass me like that?

18:15.094 --> 18:18.847
-Why do you hate me?
-This is pitiful. Just talk to him.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.518
-Who said that? [shouts]
-[screaming]

18:23.018 --> 18:26.814
Help! Help!

18:30.317 --> 18:31.318
[panting]

18:31.401 --> 18:33.112
You're the Great Raven!

18:36.532 --> 18:38.158
[panting, grunts]

18:38.242 --> 18:39.076
Hilda!

18:48.710 --> 18:50.963
-[whooshing]
-What's that?

18:58.053 --> 18:59.388
[both gasp]

18:59.471 --> 19:00.472
What?

19:01.682 --> 19:02.975
[Trevor shouts]

19:08.647 --> 19:12.234
I remember everything!

19:16.822 --> 19:18.198
Hilda!

19:26.790 --> 19:28.667
I told you I was bigger.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.336
I only take that little form
when I'm being discreet.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.755
I knew it!
You're the Great Raven!

19:33.839 --> 19:36.425
-Well, not exactly.
-What?

19:36.508 --> 19:39.052
It was all
a big misunderstanding, actually.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.349
A long, long time ago,
I was passing over the city

19:44.433 --> 19:46.143
when I landed on the statue over there.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.315
<i>The people thought</i>
<i>I was the raven messenger</i>

19:51.398 --> 19:52.983
<i>of the god they worshiped.</i>

19:53.984 --> 19:59.114
<i>That year, there was a great harvest,</i>
<i>and everyone prospered.</i>

20:00.032 --> 20:01.867
<i>They thought it was my doing,</i>

20:01.950 --> 20:05.287
<i>so the following year,</i>
<i>they started this festival in my honor.</i>

20:05.370 --> 20:06.830
What about the bad year?

20:06.914 --> 20:10.584
Ah, that was the year
I missed the festival.

20:10.667 --> 20:13.378
I was off somewhere else.
Probably at home.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.672
The bad luck had nothing to do with me,

20:15.756 --> 20:17.966
but everyone thought
they'd displeased me.

20:18.050 --> 20:23.222
After that, I decided to make the effort
to show myself every year.

20:24.681 --> 20:27.601
So, if you're not the Great Raven,
what are you?

20:28.227 --> 20:31.688
-I'm a thunderbird.
-What's a thunderbird?

20:32.189 --> 20:34.316
Eh, just a bird for the most part.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.235
But I can do this!

20:36.318 --> 20:38.528
[thunder booming]

20:39.112 --> 20:40.364
They seem to like that.

20:42.866 --> 20:45.160
-He's here!
-Oh, he's here!

20:45.244 --> 20:46.245
The Great Raven!

20:46.328 --> 20:48.872
-[all cheering]
-The Great Raven's here!

20:48.956 --> 20:50.457
The Great Raven!

20:51.041 --> 20:52.918
It's the Great Raven!

20:54.044 --> 20:56.546
[man] Restart the parade! Yahoo!

20:57.172 --> 21:01.218
-It looks like there's a girl on him.
-David, don't be absurd.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.429
[Hilda] I just saw my mum down there.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.181
You think you could drop me off?

21:08.058 --> 21:08.892
Mum!

21:11.603 --> 21:12.437
[gasps]

21:12.521 --> 21:14.523
Hilda, you're all right!

21:14.606 --> 21:17.693
[Great Raven] Thank you
for everything, Tilda!

21:17.776 --> 21:20.320
It's Hilda, actu--
[groans] What's the point?

21:22.906 --> 21:24.032
Where are we going?

21:24.616 --> 21:26.076
Someplace special.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.208
[distant crowd chattering]

21:45.554 --> 21:47.222
[gasps] What a lovely view!

21:48.932 --> 21:51.184
Alfur! Glad you could join us.

21:51.268 --> 21:52.853
Mum, he's in your bag.

21:54.229 --> 21:57.065
I'll sign the paperwork
as soon as we get home.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.233
Thank you.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.861
It is a great spot, though.

22:01.445 --> 22:03.155
How did you know about this?

22:03.947 --> 22:08.035
This is where I would come
to watch the parade when I was your age.

22:08.118 --> 22:11.121
I know it might not match
the view you had up there.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.711
Actually, it's much better.

22:41.943 --> 22:44.071
[theme music playing]
