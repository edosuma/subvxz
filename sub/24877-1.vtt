02:02.433 --> 02:04.153
A turn for the worse

02:04.177 --> 02:06.499
as the emergence of a
new strain of virus

02:06.500 --> 02:08.899
has caused widespread
panic in the region...

02:08.900 --> 02:12.532
diagnosis between all hosts,

02:12.533 --> 02:14.399
showing animal-like behavior,

02:14.400 --> 02:17.866
increased aggression,
dehydration, and delirium.

02:50.733 --> 02:53.366
Doc?

02:53.367 --> 02:57.132
Doc?!

02:57.133 --> 02:59.099
Hello?

02:59.100 --> 03:02.232
Can somebody help me, please?
I have an emergency.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.099
Oh.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.799
Thanks.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.566
Remind me to give you
my dessert tonight.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.699
Yeah.

03:13.700 --> 03:17.566
An all-you-can-eat buffet.
It's gonna be great.

03:17.567 --> 03:19.432
Can't wait.

03:29.067 --> 03:30.499
Siseko: Patrick?

03:30.500 --> 03:32.399
You're stomach is giving
you a problem today?

03:32.400 --> 03:34.832
No, no, no. He... He... He
called the bell for me.

03:34.833 --> 03:36.399
Okay, l-look, there's...

03:36.400 --> 03:38.632
There's been a horrible
mistake, okay?

03:38.633 --> 03:41.666
I was booked in this morning
to have my appendix taken out.

03:41.667 --> 03:44.666
I mean, I wake up, and
nothing has happened.

03:44.667 --> 03:48.266
Unfortunately, we've got only
one doctor on call today.

03:48.267 --> 03:50.199
What the hell is going
on with you people?

03:50.200 --> 03:52.166
A situation called

03:52.167 --> 03:55.332
for his attention.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.766
What do you mean, a situation?

04:13.033 --> 04:15.232
Mr. Sandama, how
are you feeling?

04:15.233 --> 04:16.899
Thirsty.

04:16.899 --> 04:19.300
Okay, we'll get you some water
as soon as you're in the ward.

04:19.324 --> 04:21.166
Dr. Tulani said
that your symptoms

04:21.166 --> 04:22.799
are similar to those
of an animal bite.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.840
But we can't find any point
of contact in your body.

04:24.864 --> 04:26.266
Have you been bitten by anything

04:26.267 --> 04:29.399
in the past week that you know?

04:29.400 --> 04:30.732
Okay, we're gonna
try and get you

04:30.733 --> 04:33.299
back on your feet as
soon as possible.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.032
I'll take it from here.

04:35.033 --> 04:42.432
♪♪

04:49.633 --> 04:51.299
Hey.

04:51.300 --> 04:52.699
Hey.

04:52.700 --> 04:55.332
You look better. How
was the operation?

04:55.333 --> 04:57.766
Yeah, they, uh...
They didn't operate.

04:57.767 --> 04:59.399
What?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.600
Yeah, they're gonna do it in
the next hour or something.

05:01.624 --> 05:03.332
I gotta... Did you, uh...

05:03.333 --> 05:04.666
Did you bring the good stuff?

05:04.667 --> 05:06.666
Henry, you better
be lying to me.

05:06.667 --> 05:10.299
I-I tried. I mean...

05:10.300 --> 05:12.420
You know, the one thing I
thought you couldn't mess up

05:12.444 --> 05:14.432
is an operation.

05:14.433 --> 05:17.266
Well, look, babe, everything's
under control, okay?

05:17.267 --> 05:19.032
So just give me
the smokes and...

05:19.033 --> 05:20.966
Can't smoke inside of
a hospital, Henry.

05:20.967 --> 05:23.232
It's a hospital. I'm not
gonna smoke inside.

05:23.233 --> 05:25.032
I mean...

05:25.033 --> 05:27.432
You know what?

05:27.433 --> 05:29.167
Just take it.

05:31.567 --> 05:33.232
The main thing is,

05:33.233 --> 05:36.099
you and I will be in
America in two weeks.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.832
Everything has been arranged.

05:37.833 --> 05:40.666
Good job.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.299
I can't believe you're smoking
in front of this guy.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.666
I mean, look at him.

05:44.667 --> 05:47.999
He's a... Looks like
an old-time smoker.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.466
Ain't that right, guy?
There we go.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.166
We're not gonna let
the party pooper

05:53.167 --> 05:56.032
spoil any more of
our fun, right?

05:56.033 --> 05:57.732
I'll see you tomorrow.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.432
Try not to make
any more mistakes

05:59.433 --> 06:01.232
between now and then, okay?

06:01.233 --> 06:04.232
Yes, ma'am.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.633
Love you, too.

06:16.033 --> 06:18.099
How's that working for you?

06:18.100 --> 06:20.032
Pretty good, huh?

06:20.033 --> 06:21.932
Yeah.

06:33.833 --> 06:37.666
Siseko, I need to run to the
station clinic real quick.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.766
Station clinic?

06:39.767 --> 06:44.299
Dr. Tulani doesn't know what's
causing these symptoms.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.532
I read an... I read an article

06:45.533 --> 06:47.199
in the medical journal last week

06:47.200 --> 06:50.166
about two farmers in Monrovia.

06:50.167 --> 06:53.799
They were infected by some
sort of animal bacteria.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.632
And so...?

06:55.633 --> 06:58.399
So the symptoms are
exactly the same.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.166
Dilated pupils,
excessive sweating,

07:00.167 --> 07:01.599
heavy breathing.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.099
I just need to go
fetch it quick.

07:03.100 --> 07:06.299
Hey, Sunet...

07:06.300 --> 07:10.099
Today, let someone
else be a hero.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.499
I'll fetch it.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.632
Oh, thank you.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.732
Um... it's... It's the
gray file to your left

07:16.733 --> 07:18.299
as you walk into the room.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.532
Thanks, Siseko. Uh, Sunet...

07:20.533 --> 07:25.399
You think too much
of everyone else.

07:25.400 --> 07:29.299
Think of yourself sometimes.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.232
Yeah.

07:31.233 --> 07:35.232
Um... I need to transfer
a patient to ward D.

07:35.233 --> 07:37.700
I'll see you later.

08:28.733 --> 08:29.966
Is that...

08:31.200 --> 08:34.732
Is that smoke?

08:34.732 --> 08:35.866
Yeah, I...

08:35.866 --> 08:38.631
I think so.

08:38.633 --> 08:40.599
Actually, I saw Santa over there

08:40.600 --> 08:43.666
puffing away while I was
trying to sleep earlier.

08:43.667 --> 08:48.466
If by Santa, you mean Patrick,
then we have a problem.

08:48.467 --> 08:50.599
Patrick has acute
laryngeal cancer.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.466
He can't even speak,
let alone smoke.

08:52.467 --> 08:55.499
- Just making a little joke.
- Mm-hmm.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.632
Yeah, a... actually,
Patrick and I have been

08:57.633 --> 08:59.599
getting to know each
other a little better.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.066
Ain't that right?

09:01.067 --> 09:04.166
Yeah. See? I gave
him my dessert.

09:04.167 --> 09:07.266
Okay. Well, it looks
like you're ready to go,

09:07.267 --> 09:09.399
Mr. Williamson.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.932
We're gonna escort you
through to the theater now

09:10.933 --> 09:12.333
where the anesthetist
will meet you.

09:12.357 --> 09:14.232
Oh, you're not gonna
be joining me?

09:14.233 --> 09:16.632
As much as I would love to...

09:16.633 --> 09:18.999
doctors in training don't
get to choose what we do.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.066
Call me Henry.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.432
Yeah.

09:22.433 --> 09:25.499
She could call me any
name, know what I mean?

09:40.700 --> 09:42.932
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr.
Williamson.

09:42.933 --> 09:44.332
You feeling okay this evening?

09:44.333 --> 09:46.966
Yeah, I just hope you guys
do your job this time.

09:46.967 --> 09:49.266
Hmm. We'll do our best, sir.

09:49.267 --> 09:53.066
Count down from 10, and
you'll be fast asleep.

09:53.067 --> 09:54.999
Sweet dreams.

09:59.867 --> 10:03.866
Ten...

10:03.867 --> 10:06.999
nine...

10:07.000 --> 10:09.999
eight...

10:10.000 --> 10:12.366
seven...

10:12.367 --> 10:14.799
six...

10:14.800 --> 10:16.532
five...

10:17.900 --> 10:20.766
Four...

10:20.767 --> 10:22.999
three...

10:23.000 --> 10:24.066
two...

10:28.033 --> 10:30.399
One...

10:35.567 --> 10:37.200
Hello?

10:42.667 --> 10:44.966
Hello?!

10:44.967 --> 10:47.366
Doc?

10:48.867 --> 10:52.132
Sorry, the lights are off.

10:52.133 --> 10:53.332
Hello?

10:55.133 --> 10:58.133
I think I'm supposed
to be asleep.

11:02.133 --> 11:05.766
I... I can't move my legs!

11:10.500 --> 11:12.100
Hello?

11:16.200 --> 11:18.099
I can't move my body!

11:21.600 --> 11:23.566
What's happening?

11:31.233 --> 11:33.132
Hello?!

11:35.133 --> 11:36.866
Hello?!

11:45.133 --> 11:48.232
Hello?

11:53.633 --> 11:56.566
Hello?!

11:56.567 --> 12:00.566
Hello, somebody!

12:00.567 --> 12:02.899
Help! Hey, hey!

12:13.100 --> 12:15.666
Help! Help, help!

12:15.667 --> 12:16.966
Nurse, help!

12:16.967 --> 12:18.232
Help me!

12:18.233 --> 12:19.899
Help, help!

12:19.900 --> 12:23.299
Doc? Help! Help!

12:34.067 --> 12:35.466
Shit, shit, shit.

12:35.467 --> 12:38.232
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Please, please.

12:38.233 --> 12:41.332
Please, please, please,
please, please.

13:37.667 --> 13:41.266
Hello?

13:41.267 --> 13:43.699
Hello, who's there?

13:46.167 --> 13:49.766
Who's there?

13:49.767 --> 13:50.932
Who...

13:50.933 --> 13:52.066
Wha...

13:52.067 --> 13:53.499
T-Talk to me.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.432
What happe... W-What happened?

13:55.433 --> 13:57.466
I need to get out of here.

13:57.467 --> 13:58.899
You need to help me.
I need to g...

13:58.900 --> 14:00.432
I need to get out of here.

14:00.433 --> 14:02.999
I can't feel my legs.
I can't move.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.432
You didn't fall asleep?

14:05.433 --> 14:08.832
I've been awake the whole time.

14:08.833 --> 14:10.732
Can you feel this?

14:10.733 --> 14:12.832
Yeah.

14:12.833 --> 14:15.032
Yeah, slight... slightly.

14:15.033 --> 14:16.433
Your touch sensitive
is coming back.

14:16.457 --> 14:19.032
You'll... You'll be walking soon.
Just wait.

14:19.033 --> 14:20.766
Hey, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

14:20.767 --> 14:22.399
Nurse?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.032
Nurse, wait!

14:24.033 --> 14:26.799
Nurse, wait! Wait!

14:26.800 --> 14:31.032
Wait!

14:31.033 --> 14:33.799
My name is Sunet,
and I'm a doctor.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.066
Okay.

14:48.033 --> 14:50.632
I need to find a phone.

15:57.567 --> 15:58.899
Let's go.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.999
Okay. Let's go.

16:11.133 --> 16:13.099
Vincent? Vincent?

16:13.100 --> 16:15.599
Vincent?! Vincent?!

16:44.767 --> 16:48.166
Um...

16:50.967 --> 16:52.932
I hope it's charged.

16:58.967 --> 17:00.032
Hey, it's me.

17:00.033 --> 17:01.699
Henry, where are you?!

17:01.700 --> 17:04.199
I'm in the hospital,
where you left me.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.799
Look, w-when you getting here?

17:05.800 --> 17:08.598
I don't know. Everything's
quarantined...

17:08.599 --> 17:10.665
The city, the airport,
the buses, the roads.

17:10.666 --> 17:12.832
Just, w-when you
getting here, Laurian?

17:12.833 --> 17:15.165
I'm not getting there!

17:15.166 --> 17:18.332
They're taking us all
to some rural airport.

17:18.333 --> 17:21.699
Hey, do you know of a rural
airport in the area?

17:21.700 --> 17:23.766
Um... yeah.

17:23.767 --> 17:25.232
Harb... Harbel.

17:25.233 --> 17:27.632
Harbel's the only one.
It's about a day's drive.

17:27.633 --> 17:29.532
Okay, yeah, yeah. I
know where it is.

17:29.533 --> 17:32.166
Who's that? Who's with you?

17:32.167 --> 17:34.166
Just a doctor.

17:34.167 --> 17:37.999
Look, Henry, this convoy
is completely crowded.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.666
There's not gonna be any
space for stragglers.

17:40.667 --> 17:41.999
I gotta go.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.432
Wait, let me help you.

17:50.967 --> 17:54.866
I'm good. I'm good.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.232
Uh...

17:56.233 --> 17:58.432
Okay, um...

17:58.433 --> 18:00.266
We need to...

18:00.267 --> 18:02.699
We need to find a
way out of here.

18:06.067 --> 18:08.732
- What is that?
- Someone's alive.

18:08.733 --> 18:10.666
- What?
- G8.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.632
Someone just pressed the "Call
for Assistance" button in G8.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.232
Wait, you're not
going back up there.

18:14.233 --> 18:15.599
They need our help.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.566
No, Sunet. You're not
going back up there.

18:18.567 --> 18:22.766
We never leave someone behind.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.999
Sunet, just...

18:26.000 --> 18:27.032
Sunet?!

18:27.033 --> 18:29.832
Shit.

19:15.667 --> 19:18.432
Patrick!

19:21.368 --> 19:23.066
You're okay.

19:40.867 --> 19:42.499
Run! Patrick!

19:53.100 --> 19:55.766
Henry, come on! Let's go!

20:03.133 --> 20:05.966
Get down. Patrick, get down.

20:05.967 --> 20:08.799
Uh, okay...

20:10.633 --> 20:12.632
Well, we're locked in.

20:16.233 --> 20:17.932
Ugh!

20:20.667 --> 20:21.699
What...

20:21.700 --> 20:24.099
What the hell is it?

20:24.100 --> 20:25.999
Damn it.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.166
What?

20:28.167 --> 20:30.299
I dropped the phone.

20:30.300 --> 20:33.399
Without that phone, w...
We're screwed.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.699
What are you gonna do?

20:42.267 --> 20:43.366
I think it's gone.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.732
What are you doing?

20:44.733 --> 20:47.199
It's gone, okay. I'm
gonna get the phone.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.066
Just hold the door, okay?

20:49.067 --> 20:52.766
- Henry.
- He's gone.

20:52.767 --> 20:56.266
Okay.

20:56.267 --> 20:58.166
I don't know if
he's coming back.

20:58.167 --> 20:59.866
Open the door.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.399
Let me in.

21:10.733 --> 21:13.099
What's wrong with you?

21:15.867 --> 21:18.466
Let's go. Easy, easy!

21:28.700 --> 21:30.066
Get up! Siseko!

21:30.067 --> 21:32.099
Come, come, come, come!
Come, come!

21:32.100 --> 21:34.199
This way! Move! Come.
Move, move, move!

21:34.200 --> 21:36.632
Let's go, let's go!

21:36.633 --> 21:38.699
Move, move!

21:38.700 --> 21:39.799
Move!

21:39.800 --> 21:41.499
Where's Patrick! Get Patrick!

21:45.700 --> 21:48.832
Henry: Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

21:54.100 --> 21:55.599
Wait, get it off!

21:55.600 --> 21:56.966
Get him off!

22:04.267 --> 22:05.566
Are you guys okay?

22:05.567 --> 22:07.766
Yes, Siseko, we're fine.
What's happening?

22:07.767 --> 22:11.132
The whole place has
been evacuated!

22:11.133 --> 22:12.432
So where are we going?

22:12.433 --> 22:15.033
We are on our way to Gialbi.

22:17.033 --> 22:19.600
No, we need to go to Harbel!

22:21.600 --> 22:22.899
Aaah!

22:22.900 --> 22:24.132
What's wrong with him?

22:24.133 --> 22:25.866
He never went in for
his appendectomy.

22:25.867 --> 22:27.032
We need to get this out now!

22:27.033 --> 22:28.266
How long do we have?

22:28.267 --> 22:30.100
Now, Siseko, right now!
Pull over!

22:34.300 --> 22:36.032
Siseko, help me!

22:36.033 --> 22:39.566
Siseko, help!

22:39.567 --> 22:41.966
Give him to me, Vincent.
Go get a table!

22:41.967 --> 22:43.799
Wait, wait, wait!

22:45.367 --> 22:47.099
Are you there, Vincent?

22:50.867 --> 22:53.332
Oh, wait, wait! Aaaaah!

22:53.333 --> 22:55.493
Vincent, I need you to get
me a blade, something sharp.

22:55.517 --> 22:56.966
Go. Get it out! Just get it out!

22:56.967 --> 22:58.966
Siseko! Calm him!

23:05.033 --> 23:07.566
What?!

23:07.567 --> 23:09.666
Just do it!

23:09.667 --> 23:10.600
Just do it!

23:10.601 --> 23:12.166
Okay, Siseko, I need the blade!

23:13.667 --> 23:17.666
Use the bottle, then!

23:17.667 --> 23:19.166
Aaaaaah!

23:19.167 --> 23:22.066
Wait, wait, wait!

23:22.067 --> 23:23.766
Wait.

23:23.767 --> 23:24.767
On three.

23:24.768 --> 23:25.932
Wait, wait, wait.

23:25.933 --> 23:27.532
Put it in!

23:27.533 --> 23:29.099
On three!

23:29.100 --> 23:30.366
Wait.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.666
One...

23:31.667 --> 23:33.066
Noooo!

23:33.067 --> 23:34.699
Hold him down.

23:34.700 --> 23:36.832
Hold him down.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.066
You gotta hold him down.

23:38.067 --> 23:39.427
Siseko, I need you
to put pressure.

23:39.451 --> 23:40.866
I need you to put pressure.

23:40.867 --> 23:42.332
Hold it, press it down.

23:42.333 --> 23:45.166
You need to hold still for me.

23:49.967 --> 23:51.632
Hang in there.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.433
You're doing great.
You're doing great.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.032
Hey.

24:01.033 --> 24:03.032
Okay.

24:03.033 --> 24:05.199
Just there.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.032
Okay, I got it.

24:16.267 --> 24:17.932
Outside.

24:17.933 --> 24:19.932
Outside, outside, outside.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.799
What's it doing?

24:25.800 --> 24:27.767
Vincent?

24:28.567 --> 24:30.132
No, no, no, no.

24:34.700 --> 24:36.966
I need you, Siseko! I need you!

24:49.533 --> 24:51.632
Where'd he go?

24:51.633 --> 24:53.232
Where'd he go?

25:00.233 --> 25:01.899
He's got to be here somewhere.

25:06.433 --> 25:08.732
Go! Go!

25:10.267 --> 25:12.299
- Go, go!
- Go, go, go!

25:12.300 --> 25:14.232
Drive, Siseko!

25:14.233 --> 25:15.866
Go!

27:02.833 --> 27:04.766
What's the problem?

27:04.767 --> 27:07.866
Petrol.

27:07.867 --> 27:09.332
We don't have any jimmy cans?

27:09.333 --> 27:10.167
No.

27:10.168 --> 27:13.032
So what are we gonna do?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.667
We must walk.

27:23.867 --> 27:26.099
Do you really think we can
walk all the way to Gialbi?

27:26.100 --> 27:28.332
We must try.

27:28.333 --> 27:30.466
And then when we get there,
when we reach Ayanda,

27:30.467 --> 27:31.832
what then? When we get there,

27:31.833 --> 27:34.066
maybe we can find someone
who can help us.

27:34.067 --> 27:36.232
It's just another
township, Siseko.

27:36.233 --> 27:38.999
There's nothing there.
Let's stick together.

27:40.533 --> 27:43.932
That's your... That's
your big plan?

27:43.933 --> 27:47.300
Stick together, that's it?
Do you have a better plan?

27:48.600 --> 27:51.366
Hey, I can get us out of here.

27:51.367 --> 27:53.399
Well, yesterday when
I spoke to Laurian

27:53.400 --> 27:54.766
on the satellite phone,

27:54.767 --> 27:57.466
sh-she told me about a
convoy tomorrow morning

27:57.467 --> 27:59.966
taking a bunch of people
to a private airstrip.

27:59.967 --> 28:03.732
I'm talking water, supplies.
It's a place called Harbel.

28:03.733 --> 28:05.132
Yeah.

28:05.133 --> 28:07.032
I can make a plan and get
all of us out of here.

28:07.033 --> 28:09.032
Henry, are you sure?

28:09.033 --> 28:12.066
Yeah. I promise, for
all of us, you know.

28:12.067 --> 28:14.832
Get... just get me
to the right spot.

28:14.833 --> 28:16.166
I'm sorry, Mr. Henry.

28:16.167 --> 28:17.767
I don't need a journey
out of this place.

28:17.791 --> 28:21.066
I want to go and get my son.
Do you understand?

28:21.067 --> 28:23.932
Well, with all due
respect, Siseko,

28:23.933 --> 28:25.466
I think this convoy may just be

28:25.467 --> 28:27.899
your son's only
chance of survival.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.299
So think about it.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.499
Siseko, this...

28:31.500 --> 28:35.399
This might be our only chance.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.133
It's Ayanda's only chance.

28:45.467 --> 28:48.299
Okay.

28:48.300 --> 28:51.332
Let's go to that convoy.

28:51.333 --> 28:55.399
And once we are there,
then we can get my son.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.099
Yeah.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.466
Great.

28:58.467 --> 29:01.832
Now, how do I get to Harbel?

29:01.833 --> 29:03.799
We walk.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.433
We'll rest here.

30:19.433 --> 30:22.400
Help me take his clothes off.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.599
I'm tired of seeing
this American

30:26.600 --> 30:28.600
wearing a woman's dress.

30:36.400 --> 30:39.400
I don't suppose
any of you smoke.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.033
Sorry.

30:56.567 --> 31:00.532
What did he say?

31:00.533 --> 31:03.899
He says he doesn't have a light.

31:03.900 --> 31:06.199
Oh.

31:06.200 --> 31:09.232
But you guys make fire, right?

31:09.233 --> 31:12.832
Like, with two pieces of wood.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.499
Americans.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.966
Great.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.666
So, what do you think
about my new outfit?

31:35.667 --> 31:37.132
It's fine.

31:37.133 --> 31:38.666
I think I liked you
in a dress better.

31:40.667 --> 31:44.299
Just kidding.

31:44.300 --> 31:46.666
So tell me about your fiancée.

31:46.667 --> 31:47.966
What's the story?

31:47.967 --> 31:52.332
Yeah, she's uh...

31:52.333 --> 31:54.866
she's the only one who
really stuck around.

31:54.867 --> 31:58.666
It's a little complicated.
What about you?

31:58.667 --> 32:03.166
I mean, is there a boyfriend
or a hubby back home?

32:06.467 --> 32:08.166
I mean...

32:08.167 --> 32:09.966
It must be pretty tough.

32:09.967 --> 32:11.432
What?

32:11.433 --> 32:13.866
I've been here, like,
two and a half months,

32:13.867 --> 32:17.599
and the only white guy I
saw is like 79 years old.

32:18.767 --> 32:20.832
Excuse me.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.266
Hey, guys!

32:26.267 --> 32:28.733
I'm just gonna take a leak.

32:53.467 --> 32:55.466
Henry? Hey, I... I
saw you called.

32:55.467 --> 32:57.299
What's going on? Yeah, I...

32:57.300 --> 32:59.132
I tried to get ahold of you.

32:59.133 --> 33:00.399
How are you? A-Are you okay?

33:00.400 --> 33:02.366
I'm good, babe. Listen,
what's going on?

33:02.367 --> 33:06.732
Look, Henry, I wanted to
talk to you about something.

33:06.733 --> 33:09.166
This whole thing
has been so crazy,

33:09.167 --> 33:11.866
it's made me think
about everything.

33:11.867 --> 33:14.366
I don't think it's
gonna work out for us.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.899
I know this is crazy,

33:15.900 --> 33:17.699
but I think we should
go our separate ways.

33:17.700 --> 33:20.632
You know, it's just...
There's so much now.

33:20.633 --> 33:22.599
Like, Henry, I just can't and...

33:22.600 --> 33:24.632
Babe, what are you
talking about?

33:24.633 --> 33:26.932
Babe, will you just
listen to me, okay?

33:26.933 --> 33:29.099
We are hours...

33:29.100 --> 33:32.399
Okay? We're hours away from Harbel.
Okay?

33:32.400 --> 33:34.566
Uh, Henry... Look,
no, listen, I...

33:34.567 --> 33:35.999
No, no. I know it's hard.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.232
I know it's hard, but
I need you to...

33:37.233 --> 33:38.699
I need you to just stick it out.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.466
Just stick it out for me, okay?
I can't.

33:40.467 --> 33:43.399
Just... Just get me
at Harbel, babe,

33:43.400 --> 33:47.632
and then it's you and me
on a plane, on our way.

33:47.633 --> 33:50.066
They told me I've
got a much better

33:50.067 --> 33:52.366
chance of survival on my own.

33:52.367 --> 33:54.366
Do you understand?

33:54.367 --> 33:56.099
On our own, Henry, we...
we can survive it.

33:56.100 --> 33:59.466
Babe, I came here for you!
I know, I'm sorry.

33:59.467 --> 34:02.599
Okay. Just... just promise
me you'll be at Harbel.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.600
No, no, no, Laurian. Listen to me, okay?
I'm sorry.

34:04.624 --> 34:06.699
Just promise me
you'll be at Harbel.

34:06.700 --> 34:09.532
Laurian!

34:09.533 --> 34:10.433
Laurian!

34:10.434 --> 34:12.866
Lauri...

34:37.333 --> 34:39.799
It's a bracelet that
my father gave to me

34:39.800 --> 34:43.065
when I turned 18.

34:43.067 --> 34:45.766
He told me his father
gave it to him...

34:47.632 --> 34:50.632
and I would give to my son

34:50.632 --> 34:52.667
when he becomes a man.

34:55.667 --> 35:00.233
It was Ayanda's 18th
birthday three months ago.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.233
Unfortunately, I
couldn't be there.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.799
But this time...

35:12.800 --> 35:15.199
Can I see?

35:23.967 --> 35:26.100
It's beautiful.

35:29.333 --> 35:32.300
You're a great father, Siseko.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.633
Hey, man.

35:42.767 --> 35:43.966
Yeah.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.300
Number one, I think.

35:58.967 --> 36:00.966
Hey, guys!

36:00.967 --> 36:04.866
Sunet!

36:04.867 --> 36:06.632
Sunet!

36:17.833 --> 36:20.066
Vincent?

36:39.100 --> 36:40.699
Oh, shit!

36:56.033 --> 36:58.666
Go, go!

37:10.433 --> 37:12.667
Watch! Oh!

37:14.067 --> 37:16.132
Go, go, go, go, go!

37:16.133 --> 37:17.832
Jump in here!

37:43.067 --> 37:44.166
L-Let's go.

37:58.967 --> 38:00.799
Henry. Let's move. Let's move.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.399
Are you okay?

38:40.400 --> 38:44.132
Yeah, I'm fine. Where's Vincent.

38:44.133 --> 38:45.499
He's coming.

38:58.133 --> 39:00.132
Hello?

39:14.833 --> 39:16.132
What happened to you guys?

39:16.133 --> 39:18.566
That thing came out of nowhere.

39:18.567 --> 39:20.399
You know what?

39:20.400 --> 39:22.866
I should have trusted my
gut feeling about you.

39:22.867 --> 39:24.599
What?

39:24.600 --> 39:26.566
You're a liar.

39:26.567 --> 39:28.266
What the hell are
you talking about?

39:28.267 --> 39:31.400
Your fiancée called.

39:33.800 --> 39:36.499
He's been lying to
us this whole time.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.199
None of us are going
on the convoy...

39:38.200 --> 39:39.599
None of us except him. Look...

39:39.600 --> 39:41.299
Look, I-I don't know
what she told you,

39:41.300 --> 39:42.799
but... she's lying.

39:42.800 --> 39:45.599
Oh, please, Henry. That's
always been the plan,

39:45.600 --> 39:47.560
and now we're stuck here,
in the middle of Harbel.

39:47.584 --> 39:49.666
Why would your fiancée
tell us all this?

39:49.667 --> 39:52.332
My fiancée... My fiancée...
Sh... She's...

39:52.333 --> 39:53.866
She's crazy, okay?

39:53.867 --> 39:55.099
Sh...

39:55.100 --> 39:56.899
Look, listen to me.

39:56.900 --> 39:58.999
Okay, we... We
stick to the plan,

39:59.000 --> 40:00.366
We... We get to
the convoy point,

40:00.367 --> 40:02.066
I'm gonna figure it all out.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.099
I'm gonna figure
all of this out.

40:04.100 --> 40:07.266
Okay? Just... Just
give me the phone.

40:07.267 --> 40:10.532
You are not going to
get the bloody phone.

40:10.533 --> 40:14.432
This phone stays right here,
and we are not going anywhere

40:14.433 --> 40:16.432
before you tell us
what is going on.

40:16.433 --> 40:18.699
It's no point, Siseko.
He can't help us.

40:18.700 --> 40:21.020
Just give me the phone. We
should just get to Ayanda and...

40:21.044 --> 40:22.132
Just give me the phone!

40:22.133 --> 40:23.832
Give me the phone!
What are you doing?!

40:23.833 --> 40:25.399
Just give me the phone now. Give
me the phone now. Let him go!

40:25.400 --> 40:26.699
What are you doing?! Shut up!

40:26.700 --> 40:28.500
Just give him the phone.
Give the phone to me.

40:28.524 --> 40:31.699
Shut up, shut up.
Give me the phone.

40:31.700 --> 40:34.466
Take the phone. Okay,
you're gonna take me...

40:34.467 --> 40:38.166
You're gonna take me to the
convoy point, Vincent.

40:38.167 --> 40:39.700
And you're gonna stay here.

40:40.900 --> 40:44.066
I'm sorry.

40:44.067 --> 40:48.032
I am sorry.

40:48.033 --> 40:50.099
He's going nowhere.

40:55.567 --> 41:00.299
I'm sorry. I just
need to get home.

41:00.300 --> 41:03.999
I just need to get
home right now, okay?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.432
Just go. Go ahead. Go. Go.

41:06.433 --> 41:08.666
Okay?

41:18.300 --> 41:20.332
Shhh.

41:38.900 --> 41:42.566
You are in the
middle of nowhere.

41:42.567 --> 41:46.066
Do you think you can
get to the convoy

41:46.067 --> 41:48.999
by yourself?

41:49.000 --> 41:52.832
Hmm?

41:52.833 --> 41:57.599
Don't ever lie to me again.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.832
You understand?

41:59.833 --> 42:01.466
Yeah.

42:01.467 --> 42:03.666
Come.

42:03.667 --> 42:05.767
Let's go.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.300
Well...

42:54.333 --> 42:56.799
What?

42:56.800 --> 42:59.199
Well, we have decided
that we are going

42:59.200 --> 43:01.166
to take you the
rest of the journey

43:01.167 --> 43:03.832
until you reach the convoy,

43:03.833 --> 43:05.732
and then we'll part ways.

43:05.733 --> 43:07.332
Yeah, right.

43:07.333 --> 43:09.066
All what we ask for

43:09.067 --> 43:13.600
is some supply of
food and water.

43:15.100 --> 43:18.832
For real?

43:18.833 --> 43:21.566
Yes.

43:21.567 --> 43:24.732
Yeah, yeah, I'll...
I can get supplies.

43:24.733 --> 43:28.599
You take first watch.

43:28.600 --> 43:30.200
Thank you.

43:35.667 --> 43:38.032
So you're just gonna...

43:38.033 --> 43:40.073
You're just gonna leave us
in the middle of nowhere,

43:40.097 --> 43:41.099
just like that?

43:41.100 --> 43:42.599
Look, Sunet...

43:42.600 --> 43:45.532
I was trying to get us a space.

43:48.133 --> 43:50.832
My fiancée is...

43:50.833 --> 43:53.499
She runs a tight ship.

43:53.500 --> 43:57.232
I'm gonna get all of you
everything you need.

43:57.233 --> 43:59.099
I swear, I'm gonna get
you food, supplies...

43:59.100 --> 44:02.632
Siseko knows the way to
a township near Gialbi.

44:02.633 --> 44:05.066
So we'll get there tomorrow,
and then we should be okay.

44:05.067 --> 44:06.666
Yeah, you're...

44:06.667 --> 44:08.832
You're all gonna be okay.
It's...

44:08.833 --> 44:10.732
Yeah.

44:10.733 --> 44:12.932
Good night.

44:12.933 --> 44:16.732
Look, Sunet...

44:16.733 --> 44:18.632
I'm sorry I lost it.

45:21.867 --> 45:23.966
Oh, shit!

45:28.800 --> 45:30.166
Vincent!

46:05.800 --> 46:08.932
Aaaaah!

46:27.567 --> 46:30.399
Let's move.

46:30.400 --> 46:32.999
We're not sleeping here tonight.

47:15.567 --> 47:17.199
This is it.

47:17.200 --> 47:21.666
You're sure? Yeah.

47:21.667 --> 47:28.166
This is the road between
Harbel and Farmington.

47:28.167 --> 47:29.532
All right.

47:29.533 --> 47:31.832
Yeah.

47:31.833 --> 47:34.000
Now we'll wait.

47:38.800 --> 47:41.433
Mmm.

47:48.633 --> 47:49.999
Ugh!

47:57.967 --> 48:01.266
Thanks, Siseko...

48:01.267 --> 48:02.699
for everything.

48:02.700 --> 48:05.532
Yes.

48:05.533 --> 48:07.567
Mr. Henry...

48:10.000 --> 48:12.433
next time, it won't
be like this.

48:17.033 --> 48:19.167
Vincent...

49:08.833 --> 49:10.766
Bye, Siseko.

49:13.133 --> 49:15.767
Siseko?

49:20.600 --> 49:22.966
Siseko?

49:22.967 --> 49:25.732
Siseko?

49:25.733 --> 49:28.032
Siseko, wake up.

49:51.133 --> 49:53.899
Yeah.

49:53.900 --> 49:56.132
Yeah, yeah. I see the vehicle.

50:15.167 --> 50:17.766
I'm so sorry.

50:38.767 --> 50:40.132
I'm sorry.

52:49.267 --> 52:50.766
Sunet!

52:50.767 --> 52:52.666
Sunet?!

52:54.833 --> 52:56.599
Sunet!

52:56.600 --> 53:00.066
Hey, Sunet!

53:00.067 --> 53:01.932
Henry, what are you doing?

53:01.933 --> 53:04.066
I'm going with you.

53:04.067 --> 53:05.632
What do you mean?

53:05.633 --> 53:06.666
You're gonna get Ayanda

53:06.667 --> 53:08.766
and I'm gonna get us
the hell out of here.

53:08.767 --> 53:11.132
I've got some supplies.
I've got, uh...

53:11.133 --> 53:13.232
flares and a GPS.

53:13.233 --> 53:15.273
There's a chopper coming
tomorrow morning at sunrise

53:15.297 --> 53:18.130
to takes us to...
Where's Laurian?

53:20.467 --> 53:22.233
I decided not to go with her.

53:26.300 --> 53:28.233
We never leave someone
behind, right?

53:32.133 --> 53:34.266
Let's go get Ayanda.

53:34.267 --> 53:36.567
Come on. Let's go.

53:40.800 --> 53:43.267
Hey, let's go!

53:45.300 --> 53:48.300
Y-You know you're crazy, right?

56:53.833 --> 56:55.532
Where am I going?!

57:21.467 --> 57:22.966
Slow down!

57:25.933 --> 57:27.799
Come on! Go, go, go! Go!

57:36.533 --> 57:39.232
- Let's go, American!
- Go! Go! Go, go, go, go!

57:43.833 --> 57:46.132
Keep going! Keep going!

57:51.533 --> 57:53.966
Don't look back. Keep running!

58:04.467 --> 58:07.666
- Almost there!
- Keep going, keep going!

58:12.133 --> 58:13.600
Get down. Down,
down, down, down!

58:33.233 --> 58:36.399
You got something...

58:38.300 --> 58:39.932
Yeah, let's go.

58:39.933 --> 58:41.300
Yeah.

58:43.967 --> 58:46.166
Let's go.

59:10.633 --> 59:12.400
My father?

59:15.700 --> 59:18.000
He's not here?

59:27.200 --> 59:29.733
I'm so sorry.

59:38.467 --> 59:40.999
But we're gonna get
you out of here.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.767
I promise.

59:47.133 --> 59:51.632
Your father was a
brave man, Ayanda.

59:51.633 --> 59:54.699
Okay.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.632
Now, we've only got half a
day's journey to do Duazon.

59:59.633 --> 01:00:03.399
We get some food, we're
gonna get to the ruins,

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.299
were gonna get the
hell out of here.

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.500
Let's keep moving.

01:00:57.533 --> 01:00:58.533
Wait, w...

01:00:58.534 --> 01:01:00.932
Where'd he go? Ayanda?!

01:01:00.933 --> 01:01:04.132
Ayanda?!

01:01:04.133 --> 01:01:05.732
Ayanda?!

01:01:05.733 --> 01:01:07.199
Ayanda?!

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.932
We need to go back.
Vincent, please, walk back.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:12.166
Ayanda?

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:14.066
Get back! Get back, get back.

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:36.567
It's not funny.

01:01:38.867 --> 01:01:41.100
It's pretty funny.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.932
What the hell is this?

01:02:33.933 --> 01:02:35.732
This is the Duazon ruins.

01:02:35.733 --> 01:02:40.066
No, it can't be. They
told me this is the spot.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.266
It's supposed to
be a refugee camp

01:02:44.267 --> 01:02:47.099
with supplies, water...
This is it, Henry.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.932
Where's the helicopter
meeting us?

01:02:48.933 --> 01:02:51.366
Oh, damn it.

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:53.632
We're gonna be sitting ducks.

01:03:01.033 --> 01:03:03.632
We need to get him water.

01:03:03.633 --> 01:03:06.299
Okay, we need to get indoors.
Let's move.

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:09.232
We got six hours until
that chopper comes.

01:03:09.233 --> 01:03:10.999
Let's get inside.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.232
We need to find a
place, board it up.

01:03:13.233 --> 01:03:15.399
We gotta survive until midnight.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.132
Yeah. Let's move inside.

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.966
Ayanda, we need
to board this up.

01:03:35.967 --> 01:03:38.766
All these holes, this entrance.

01:03:47.433 --> 01:03:49.799
Okay. Let's bring it up.

01:03:52.467 --> 01:03:54.732
Nice and steady.

01:04:21.133 --> 01:04:22.466
Sunet: Do you think
it will hold?

01:04:22.467 --> 01:04:24.666
Yeah, well, it's gotta
hold till sunrise.

01:04:29.267 --> 01:04:30.999
And now we wait.

01:04:51.833 --> 01:04:53.767
Good night.

01:05:31.167 --> 01:05:35.332
You know, you didn't have
to come back for us?

01:05:35.333 --> 01:05:37.267
Yeah.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.400
Thank you.

01:06:27.133 --> 01:06:29.632
Vincent?

01:06:29.633 --> 01:06:31.666
Vincent, what are you doing?!

01:06:31.667 --> 01:06:35.166
Vincent!

01:06:35.167 --> 01:06:37.032
Vincent?!

01:06:37.033 --> 01:06:38.999
Vincent!

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.666
Vincent, stay away!

01:06:47.967 --> 01:06:49.966
Aaaah!

01:06:49.967 --> 01:06:51.966
Go, Sunet! Go!

01:06:51.967 --> 01:06:53.766
Just go! Go!

01:06:56.467 --> 01:07:00.399
Go!

01:07:10.867 --> 01:07:14.466
This way! This way! This way!
No, this way.

01:07:14.467 --> 01:07:16.799
Go right! Go right! Go right!

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.432
To the roof! To the roof!
Let's go. Let's go.

01:07:27.533 --> 01:07:31.966
Go! Just get to the roof. Go.

01:07:31.967 --> 01:07:33.899
Go on, go on!

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.432
Henry, come on!

01:07:35.433 --> 01:07:37.666
Go ahead!

01:07:37.667 --> 01:07:39.866
Aaah!

01:07:39.867 --> 01:07:42.632
Go! Go to the far side!

01:07:42.633 --> 01:07:44.532
Aaaah!

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:52.732
Henry! You're hurt.

01:07:52.733 --> 01:07:54.373
I'm fine. I'm fine! We
need to get higher.

01:07:54.397 --> 01:07:55.632
Go, go, go!

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.999
One, two...

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.399
Oh.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.532
What happened to Vincent?

01:08:06.533 --> 01:08:08.899
I don't know, but we gotta
get the hell out of here.

01:08:10.233 --> 01:08:11.632
Henry, what do we What are we...

01:08:11.633 --> 01:08:14.032
What do we do? The
chopper's on the way.

01:08:14.033 --> 01:08:15.899
Choppers on the way!

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:17.265
They're a few minutes away.

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:30.032
What the hell was that?

01:08:33.832 --> 01:08:36.532
Stand back! Stand back!

01:08:36.533 --> 01:08:38.732
Oh, my God! They're everywhere!

01:08:38.733 --> 01:08:41.232
Come on! Come on!
Where are they?!

01:08:41.233 --> 01:08:43.099
They should... should
have been here by now.

01:08:45.332 --> 01:08:47.232
Come on. Come on!

01:08:52.733 --> 01:08:54.300
Where are they?!

01:08:55.933 --> 01:08:57.866
We're not gonna make it.

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:03.966
Lis... Listen to me.

01:09:03.966 --> 01:09:07.198
Okay, w... When that
chopper comes...

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.366
you light the flare, okay?

01:09:09.367 --> 01:09:10.332
Okay?

01:09:10.334 --> 01:09:14.032
You light it, hold
it high, okay?

01:09:15.633 --> 01:09:17.499
Hey, what are you gonna do?

01:09:20.733 --> 01:09:22.599
Meet me in the field.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.698
