WEBVTT

00:00.086 --> 00:01.425
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.569 --> 00:05.383
I think I might actually like Clay.

00:06.459 --> 00:07.859
I know, yuck.

00:07.894 --> 00:10.094
- We're engaged!
- Ohhhh!

00:10.129 --> 00:13.358
Who's this? He's so handsome!

00:14.032 --> 00:15.432
This is Morgan,
this is your horse for the clinic.

00:15.468 --> 00:16.834
Okay, I need to find a new stable

00:16.869 --> 00:18.802
for the out of town rodeo horses.

00:18.838 --> 00:20.804
I'll see what I can do
to find you another barn.

00:20.840 --> 00:23.940
Vern Caldwell, yeah, old friend of mine.

00:23.976 --> 00:25.355
He owed me a favor.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.350
I'm glad you guys are here,
I could use a hand.

00:27.416 --> 00:28.719
All the out of towners are coming.

00:28.801 --> 00:29.774
What's Morgan doing here,

00:29.824 --> 00:30.763
he's not in the rodeo.

00:30.912 --> 00:32.610
I bought the horses you guys used.

00:32.676 --> 00:35.002
No way!

00:35.101 --> 00:37.587
I know, it's crazy,
I don't even have room for 'em.

00:37.622 --> 00:38.989
It's a good thing Vern said

00:39.024 --> 00:40.523
I could board 'em here for a bit.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.169 --> 00:53.903
Get back!

01:15.359 --> 01:16.725
No one told him it was anything bad,

01:16.760 --> 01:18.126
so he just kept going.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.560
Make way, make way!

01:19.595 --> 01:21.329
Oop! Sorry.

01:21.364 --> 01:23.664
Okay, I'll bite...

01:23.699 --> 01:25.033
What are those?

01:25.068 --> 01:27.936
These are our tickets
to rodeo immortality.

01:27.971 --> 01:29.737
We got permits to compete in the pros.

01:29.772 --> 01:31.672
Yeah, we're running with
the big dogs this weekend.

01:31.707 --> 01:33.308
Finally gonna make some real money.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.108
Gear down hot shot,
you have to beat me first.

01:35.144 --> 01:36.944
That's old news to me.

01:36.979 --> 01:39.146
Whatever, you are so going down.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.151
Uh, be right back.

01:44.186 --> 01:46.019
Oh hey!

01:46.055 --> 01:48.489
You forgot your insulin.

01:48.524 --> 01:51.345
Insulin? Like, for diabetes?

01:55.331 --> 01:56.863
Chance of showers again on Monday,

01:56.898 --> 01:58.465
and then back to seasonal conditions,

01:58.500 --> 02:00.633
much warmer temperatures
coming up to the mid

02:00.669 --> 02:02.502
and end of next week.

02:05.474 --> 02:07.306
We have a breaking news story.

02:07.342 --> 02:10.175
A barn fire took place near Hudson,
Alberta last night.

02:10.211 --> 02:10.946
Ah! Ow! Ow!

02:11.061 --> 02:12.601
Early reports
suggest there could've been

02:12.667 --> 02:15.949
up to 25 horses in the
facility at the time.

02:15.984 --> 02:17.717
Firefighters arrived on the scene

02:17.752 --> 02:21.320
just after midnight to find
the barn engulfed in flames.

02:21.356 --> 02:24.056
- What's going on?
- We don't know yet,

02:24.092 --> 02:25.524
I couldn't get the
volume up fast enough.

02:25.559 --> 02:26.925
Hopefully they say it again.

02:26.961 --> 02:28.294
They were able to contain the fire,

02:28.329 --> 02:29.828
and save other structures
on the property,

02:29.864 --> 02:32.398
but were not able to
salvage the barn itself.

02:32.433 --> 02:34.467
It's yet to be confirmed
how many horses made it out.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.268
Jack?
- Yeah, we're in here.

02:36.304 --> 02:37.936
But given the scale of the fire...

02:37.972 --> 02:39.405
Hey, I'm gonna need some help

02:39.440 --> 02:41.339
- with the rodeo this weekend.
- Dad, Dad, shh, please!

02:41.375 --> 02:43.074
What, what, what's this?

02:43.110 --> 02:44.877
It was a barn fire, it's really bad.

02:44.912 --> 02:46.979
An absolutely devastating reality

02:47.014 --> 02:48.747
that will affect so many horse owners

02:48.782 --> 02:51.550
from Alberta, B.C., and Montana.

02:52.119 --> 02:53.852
The owner of the barn, Vern Caldwell,

02:53.888 --> 02:55.487
has not been available for comment...

02:55.523 --> 02:57.555
- Vern Caldwell?!
- Yeah, you know him?

02:57.590 --> 02:58.956
Yeah.

02:59.870 --> 03:02.193
Yeah, he-he's the guy,
that's where Casey's...

03:02.229 --> 03:03.895
rodeo horses are stabled.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.830
Those were my barrel horses!

03:05.865 --> 03:08.099
Thanks, Ally.
In case you're just joining us,

03:08.135 --> 03:10.468
That was CSNS's Ally Swanson...

03:10.504 --> 03:12.137
Caldwell Stables,

03:12.172 --> 03:14.171
that's where all of
Tim's horses are boarded!

03:14.206 --> 03:17.608
- And Casey's.
- Oh my God...

03:17.644 --> 03:19.376
Morgan.

03:26.586 --> 03:29.520
Do you know how many were in there?

03:38.297 --> 03:39.763
Oh!

03:39.798 --> 03:41.698
Oh, honey.

03:43.102 --> 03:44.468
I got the call from Vern this morning.

03:44.503 --> 03:46.536
It's all over the news.
The horses, what happened?

03:46.572 --> 03:48.538
Did-did any of them...?

03:50.809 --> 03:52.408
How many?

03:52.444 --> 03:54.510
Only one got out.

03:54.546 --> 03:56.479
Where is it?

04:03.188 --> 04:05.921
Morgan! That's... That's my horse!

04:05.957 --> 04:07.290
Morgan!

04:09.060 --> 04:12.589

04:12.787 --> 04:16.877
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

04:57.240 --> 04:59.306
Amy, Amy! No, no, no!

04:59.702 --> 05:01.943
No, you let me do that.

05:04.147 --> 05:06.380
Easy, easy.

05:06.415 --> 05:08.016
Easy...

05:08.051 --> 05:09.883
easy now.

05:13.322 --> 05:15.656
Okay, that's it,
that's it, that's a boy...

05:15.691 --> 05:17.224
that's a good boy.

05:19.495 --> 05:21.295
That's it... whoa!

05:21.330 --> 05:22.729
Dad!

05:22.765 --> 05:25.132
Dad please, just get out of there.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.240
He's probably so traumatized.

05:34.276 --> 05:36.043
I can't imagine how
terrifying that would've been,

05:36.078 --> 05:37.544
in there with all those horses.

05:37.579 --> 05:39.445
It's okay.

05:39.481 --> 05:40.847
Anxiety like that though,

05:40.883 --> 05:42.348
that can be dangerous, right?

05:42.384 --> 05:44.384
It could cause him to colic.

05:44.419 --> 05:47.119
Well,
we oughta get him outta there.

05:47.155 --> 05:49.722
The smoke and the smell...

05:49.757 --> 05:51.891
Let's take him to Heartland,
and I can work with him there.

05:51.926 --> 05:54.026
How? I can't even get near him, he...

05:55.252 --> 05:56.128
Dad, let me try.

05:56.164 --> 05:57.664
- No, Amy!
- Please!

05:57.699 --> 06:01.633
- I'll take it slow, I...
- It's okay, Tim, I got her.

06:04.605 --> 06:06.638
- It's okay.
- Jack.

06:47.947 --> 06:49.280
Camelot.

07:04.664 --> 07:06.263
I've been trying to get a hold of you!

07:06.298 --> 07:08.031
I was at Caldwell's.

07:09.869 --> 07:11.635
I know, the fire.

07:11.670 --> 07:13.336
- Is Morgan...
- Yeah, he's okay.

07:13.372 --> 07:14.772
I just dropped him off at the ranch.

07:14.807 --> 07:16.673
Oh my God, I was so worried!

07:16.708 --> 07:18.341
He's pretty edgy though.

07:18.377 --> 07:20.343
Amy's gonna work with him.

07:20.379 --> 07:24.171
Okay, and the other horses, they're...

07:26.017 --> 07:28.885
Well, Morgan made it, and uh...

07:30.355 --> 07:32.730
You mean the rest of them were...

07:36.060 --> 07:38.360
I'm-I'm coming home right now!

07:38.396 --> 07:39.728
Yeah, you go, I'll cover for you.

07:39.764 --> 07:41.130
Thank you.

07:45.336 --> 07:46.702
Oh come on, seriously?

07:46.737 --> 07:48.470
You gotta know something by now.

07:48.506 --> 07:51.207
Tim, you gotta let them do their jobs.

07:51.242 --> 07:52.741
I just want some answers!

07:52.777 --> 07:54.576
I just wanna know how it started!

07:54.612 --> 07:56.011
That's all I want! Come on, dammit!

07:56.046 --> 07:59.281
You know it's gonna take some time.

07:59.317 --> 08:01.283
So what do we tell everybody, huh?

08:01.319 --> 08:02.685
Everybody that lost their horses

08:02.720 --> 08:04.953
and their livelihoods.

08:04.988 --> 08:07.823
Believe me, I'm sick about it.

08:07.858 --> 08:09.291
What about you?

08:09.327 --> 08:11.159
I mean, you lost your new horses.

08:11.195 --> 08:12.627
Oh, there's no time for that, Casey.

08:12.662 --> 08:14.762
We gotta get to work on your rodeo.

08:14.798 --> 08:17.065
My rodeo?
I'm gonna to cancel it, obviously...

08:17.100 --> 08:19.534
No, we're pushing forward.

08:19.569 --> 08:20.936
After everything that happened?!

08:20.971 --> 08:22.804
We can't leave it just like this!

08:22.840 --> 08:25.369
We've gotta do something
for these people.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.076
I gotta do something for these people.

08:56.438 --> 08:58.739
Georgie, please be careful,
he's not himself!

09:00.609 --> 09:02.843
Oh, good boy.

09:02.878 --> 09:04.244
Hey!

09:06.582 --> 09:08.114
Whew.

09:09.585 --> 09:11.985
Is that the syrup for his lungs?

09:12.020 --> 09:14.821
It should help open them up.

09:14.857 --> 09:16.789
Hey, Georgie?

09:16.824 --> 09:19.092
He's having trouble breathing.

09:19.127 --> 09:21.627
Maybe you could hold
him and keep him calm,

09:21.662 --> 09:23.496
while grandpa gives him some medicine?

09:23.531 --> 09:26.432
Yeah, I'll do whatever you want, um...

09:26.467 --> 09:28.902
Is there
anything else we can do?

09:28.937 --> 09:31.637
Anything to help keep him calm,
soothe him.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.105
You know, maybe some light brushing,

09:33.140 --> 09:35.240
you could walk him around on foot.

09:35.276 --> 09:37.576
We just need to bring his anxiety down.

09:37.612 --> 09:39.311
Okay.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.415
I can't believe this happened.

09:42.450 --> 09:44.116
Yeah, I know.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.903
I know.

09:48.823 --> 09:50.488
It's not a bad looking horse,
but...

09:50.524 --> 09:51.924
Yeah.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.192
Whether or not it has
any roping experience.

09:54.228 --> 09:56.261
Well, you gotta find out.

09:57.482 --> 09:59.097
- Morning.
- Hi.

09:59.133 --> 10:00.498
I don't mean to be insensitive,

10:00.534 --> 10:01.900
but I hope you didn't call us here

10:01.936 --> 10:03.302
to tell us the rodeo's cancelled.

10:03.337 --> 10:04.736
- No, no, it's on.
- Good.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.304
Since you need cash so badly though,

10:06.339 --> 10:08.205
I was hopin' that maybe
you'll work with Jade and Clay

10:08.241 --> 10:09.607
and get 'em rodeo ready.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.743
Me? Huh! Hell yeah.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.144
Okay.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.813
I'm gonna need you to take
a hit though this weekend.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.247
What's that mean?

10:16.282 --> 10:17.615
Well, it's for the horse owners.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.083
Casey and I have started this fund.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.218
She's gonna work on getting sponsors,

10:21.254 --> 10:24.956
and I'm asking everyone to
donate part of their winnings.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.525
- Okay.
- Good.

10:29.996 --> 10:31.329
Me and my brother are up from Montana,

10:31.364 --> 10:32.763
He's one of those owners.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.398
Lost a roping horse at Caldwell's.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.334
Yeah. Well...

10:36.369 --> 10:38.535
I'm sorry to hear that.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.571
I guess you can appreciate
what we're trying to do here.

10:40.606 --> 10:43.239
Oh I see exactly what's happening here.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.843
Huh! You had some nerve.

10:45.878 --> 10:48.745
You expect everybody else
to make up for your mistake?

10:48.781 --> 10:50.180
What?!

10:50.215 --> 10:52.115
You boarded those horses
there to save a few bucks,

10:52.150 --> 10:54.084
- it's your fault!
- Whoa, gentlemen!

10:54.119 --> 10:56.186
Let's just all calm down a second.

10:56.221 --> 10:57.920
You're not gonna see a cent from us.

10:57.956 --> 10:59.856
This is all on you.

11:08.867 --> 11:10.400
Your breathing's getting better.

11:10.435 --> 11:12.702
Does that syrup taste okay?

11:14.739 --> 11:16.839
Hey.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.375
- How's he doing?
- He's all right, I guess.

11:19.410 --> 11:21.744
Pretty stressed.

11:21.779 --> 11:23.112
How about you?

11:25.628 --> 11:27.316
I'm okay.

11:28.752 --> 11:30.452
He's doing a lot better, but...

11:30.488 --> 11:31.987
I'm worried about him.

11:37.061 --> 11:38.827
It seems like he's found a friend.

11:38.862 --> 11:42.231
Yeah, Spartan keeps coming to say hi.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.500
It's like he can tell he's hurting.

11:44.535 --> 11:47.035
Well, I have to admit the
more I hang out with you,

11:47.070 --> 11:49.796
the more I believe that kind of stuff.

11:50.373 --> 11:51.791
Um...

11:51.874 --> 11:54.576
Can we talk about what happened
at Maggie's with the insulin...

11:54.611 --> 11:56.411
Actually, I think I should get going.

11:56.446 --> 11:58.980
I just wanted to swing by
to see how you were doing.

11:59.016 --> 12:00.281
Okay.

12:06.822 --> 12:08.189
Okay...

12:08.224 --> 12:09.857
I'll call you later.

12:09.892 --> 12:11.659
All right.

12:26.809 --> 12:29.643
Hey, you're that reporter from the news.

12:29.679 --> 12:31.946
- Ally Swanson, right?
- That's me.

12:31.981 --> 12:33.406
You're covering the fire.

12:33.505 --> 12:36.883
Yeah, not the most uplifting
story I've ever followed.

12:36.918 --> 12:39.453
Yeah, it's devastating.

12:39.488 --> 12:41.955
But the rodeo's still moving forward.

12:41.990 --> 12:45.925
So maybe that'll help
everyone move past this.

12:45.961 --> 12:48.128
Hey, have you heard about
that female bronc rider?

12:48.163 --> 12:49.496
Really?

12:49.531 --> 12:51.163
Yeah, this is her first pro rodeo.

12:51.199 --> 12:53.466
Hmm, cool.

12:53.501 --> 12:55.802
- What's her name?
- Jade.

12:55.837 --> 12:57.770
Jade Virani.

13:05.580 --> 13:08.314
Hey, good timing,
you can help me bring Morgan in.

13:08.349 --> 13:09.915
Bring him in?

13:09.950 --> 13:11.683
Yeah, I thought we'd put
him in the barn tonight.

13:11.719 --> 13:13.486
No, Amy!

13:15.055 --> 13:17.823
The last time that he was in a...

13:17.858 --> 13:20.659
we can't just throw him
in a stall right now.

13:20.694 --> 13:22.128
I get where you're coming from,

13:22.163 --> 13:24.229
but if we take this nice and slow...

13:24.264 --> 13:26.415
No! I said no.

13:28.002 --> 13:30.002
He's gotta stay outside.

13:30.037 --> 13:31.369
I'm sorry.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.106
At least for now.

13:35.876 --> 13:37.275
Okay.

13:41.881 --> 13:44.048
Oh...

13:47.854 --> 13:50.355
Hey, how's it going?
- Hey...

13:50.390 --> 13:52.524
It's been a really long day.

13:52.559 --> 13:55.360
Yeah? You look pretty bagged.

13:55.395 --> 13:57.962
Thanks.

13:57.997 --> 14:00.531
Was the baby kicking
up a storm last night?

14:00.566 --> 14:02.867
Yeah, it's a pretty amazing feeling,

14:02.902 --> 14:05.435
but it's hard to get any sleep.

14:06.973 --> 14:08.973
And then this morning...

14:09.008 --> 14:10.741
Ty, something happened.

14:10.777 --> 14:14.711
What do you mean? Is everything okay?

14:14.746 --> 14:16.079
No.

14:16.114 --> 14:17.581
Well, what happened, Amy?

14:19.185 --> 14:22.286
There was a fire in a barn near here,

14:22.321 --> 14:24.555
and it was full of horses.

14:26.325 --> 14:28.858
I can't talk about it,
I'll probably lose it.

14:28.894 --> 14:32.193
I just miss you so much!

14:32.330 --> 14:33.997
- That's it, I'm coming home.
- What?!

14:34.032 --> 14:35.498
I said I'd be back at the
first sign of trouble.

14:35.533 --> 14:39.465
No Ty, please,
don't just hop on a plane.

14:40.238 --> 14:42.338
I'll be okay, I just...

14:42.373 --> 14:43.973
I need to get my mind off this,

14:44.009 --> 14:46.688
what's goin' on with you?

14:49.615 --> 14:50.713
Uh...

14:50.748 --> 14:52.081
Well...

14:53.309 --> 14:55.218
it's kinda been "Sleepless in Mongolia."

14:55.253 --> 14:56.919
Sympathy baby kicks?

14:56.954 --> 14:59.655
No, try a roommate that
sleepwalks and sleep talks.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.056
What, seriously?

15:01.092 --> 15:03.525
Yeah, Bob is up all hours of the night,

15:03.560 --> 15:06.095
talking about the animals at
the reserve, checking on them,

15:06.130 --> 15:07.495
and then he'll walk over to the door,

15:07.531 --> 15:09.832
and I have to lead him back to his bed.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.666
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.235
And the best part is,

15:13.270 --> 15:14.669
he doesn't remember any of it.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.171
He just sleeps right through it.

15:16.207 --> 15:18.240
What a lucky guy.

15:21.077 --> 15:23.044
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:24.814 --> 15:26.333
So...

15:27.050 --> 15:29.150
how many sponsors have you got?

15:29.185 --> 15:32.287
Really, you wanna get
straight to the money talk?

15:32.322 --> 15:33.655
Sorry.

15:33.690 --> 15:35.257
You look nice.

15:35.292 --> 15:37.091
- I-I'm...
- Hey.

15:37.127 --> 15:38.492
It's okay.

15:39.929 --> 15:42.495
Most of them have been pretty generous.

15:43.633 --> 15:45.066
I'm sorry, I'm just...

15:45.101 --> 15:47.735
I've been talking about this all day,
I'm exhausted.

15:47.771 --> 15:49.370
You must be too.

15:49.405 --> 15:52.373
Yeah well... I'm gettin' through it.

15:57.747 --> 15:59.146
On the heels of a devastating barn fire

15:59.181 --> 16:01.248
that has left the town
of Hudson reeling,

16:01.284 --> 16:03.250
we have received new information

16:03.286 --> 16:05.919
that Caldwell stables
is not the facility

16:05.954 --> 16:07.588
where out of town competitors

16:07.623 --> 16:09.756
have boarded their horses in the past.

16:09.792 --> 16:12.893
The decision to change venues
was made just last week,

16:12.928 --> 16:15.762
by a local rodeo legend
named Tim Fleming.

16:15.798 --> 16:18.165
Some are suggesting his
attempt to cut costs...

16:18.200 --> 16:20.200
That's ridiculous.

16:20.235 --> 16:22.663
She doesn't know what the
hell she's talking about.

16:44.660 --> 16:46.426
Hey.

16:46.461 --> 16:48.428
Hey.

16:48.463 --> 16:50.196
I guess you heard the rodeo's on.

16:50.231 --> 16:52.098
Yeah, I did, I heard that.

16:52.133 --> 16:54.767
Don't plan on missing
that little ceremony.

16:54.802 --> 16:56.436
Because Casey still wants you introduced

16:56.471 --> 16:58.237
as the newest member
of the hall of fame.

16:58.273 --> 17:00.106
Yeah, yeah, that'll be fine.

17:00.141 --> 17:02.541
I was expecting to see you
at the ranch this morning,

17:02.577 --> 17:05.010
I thought you'd be coming
by to check on Morgan.

17:05.045 --> 17:06.712
Yeah, later, I'm busy.

17:06.747 --> 17:08.280
Well, that's good.

17:08.315 --> 17:11.550
It's good to stay busy it keeps
your mind off of... things.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.356
You saw the news report?

17:17.392 --> 17:18.723
Yeah, I did.

17:18.759 --> 17:22.694
I hope you're not taking
that b.s. seriously.

17:22.729 --> 17:24.061
What? That...

17:25.044 --> 17:26.865
everybody thinks that I'm responsible

17:26.901 --> 17:28.300
for the death of 20 horses?

17:28.335 --> 17:30.710
Not everybody.

17:31.038 --> 17:33.038
And those that are, they're...

17:33.073 --> 17:35.172
they're not being fair.

17:35.208 --> 17:38.209
Not that any of this is fair, I guess.

17:38.244 --> 17:39.677
Lots of people are struggling,

17:39.713 --> 17:42.046
Like you must be,
you had horses there too.

17:42.081 --> 17:44.549
Jack, I don't have time for this,
I told you,

17:44.584 --> 17:45.950
I got a lot on my plate.

17:45.985 --> 17:47.985
Yet, here you are,

17:48.021 --> 17:50.913
by yourself, cleaning tack.

17:52.825 --> 17:54.558
Is that from the fire?

17:56.629 --> 17:58.262
I gotta get to work.

18:04.070 --> 18:06.037
What are they doing here?!

18:06.072 --> 18:07.838
She thinks I'm an interesting story.

18:07.873 --> 18:09.306
I wonder who planted that bug.

18:09.341 --> 18:11.041
All right, well,
I don't want them to be a distraction.

18:11.076 --> 18:12.443
Tim put me in charge of you two

18:12.478 --> 18:14.277
because he knew I could handle it.

18:14.313 --> 18:16.547
I want you to block them out completely.

18:16.582 --> 18:18.615
It happens to coincide
with today's lesson.

18:18.651 --> 18:20.451
And what exactly is that supposed to be?

18:20.486 --> 18:21.885
Visualization techniques.

18:21.921 --> 18:24.054
Uh, Tim would never make us do that.

18:24.089 --> 18:26.289
You're right, he wouldn't.
He's old school.

18:26.325 --> 18:28.624
So think of me as new school.

18:28.660 --> 18:30.327
I want you to close your eyes,

18:30.362 --> 18:32.829
take a nice, long,
deep breath through your nose.

18:34.599 --> 18:37.167
And a deep,
relaxing exhale out your mouth.

18:39.338 --> 18:40.937
Now picture yourself.

18:40.972 --> 18:43.038
You're at the rodeo,
you're in the chute,

18:43.074 --> 18:44.774
and you're getting dialed in.

18:44.809 --> 18:47.610
You hear that roar of the crowd.

18:47.645 --> 18:49.411
And you just block 'em out.

18:49.447 --> 18:51.747
You're here for one reason
and one reason only,

18:51.783 --> 18:54.550
and that is the thousand pounds of fury

18:54.586 --> 18:56.919
sitting right beneath you.

18:56.955 --> 18:59.855
What side of eight seconds
are you gonna be on?

18:59.890 --> 19:01.590
Can you do this?

19:03.027 --> 19:05.394
Well, can you?

19:07.231 --> 19:09.731
Guys?

19:17.608 --> 19:20.074
I can't believe we have to
work with Caleb again tomorrow.

19:20.110 --> 19:21.810
It's only one more practice.

19:21.845 --> 19:23.177
He's just trying too hard
to make the transition

19:23.213 --> 19:24.679
into coaching.

19:24.715 --> 19:26.948
He's feeling his age, I get it.

19:26.984 --> 19:28.550
He must almost be 30.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.918
Hell, I feel the same way,
and I just turned 20.

19:30.953 --> 19:32.320
You did? When?

19:32.355 --> 19:33.888
Today, actually.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.656
Shut up!

19:35.691 --> 19:38.326
Why didn't you say anything?

19:38.361 --> 19:40.261
I don't like a big hoopla made over me.

19:40.296 --> 19:41.929
Yeah, right.

19:41.964 --> 19:43.764
I'm just trying to keep
my mind on this rodeo.

19:43.799 --> 19:47.506
But maybe I should do a
little something to celebrate.

19:48.203 --> 19:50.938
Care to join me for a frosty?

19:50.973 --> 19:53.340
Come on... it's my birthday.

19:54.744 --> 19:56.944
Fine, but no chugging this time.

19:58.347 --> 19:59.947
Okay.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.903
You still worried about Morgan?

20:06.455 --> 20:09.923
Yeah, but I think he's
starting to calm down a bit.

20:10.520 --> 20:11.958
I'm really sorry about all this.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.360
You seem pretty stressed.

20:13.395 --> 20:15.429
Yeah, maybe I should take some Valerian.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.497
- It's the herb Amy's using.
- I know what it is.

20:17.533 --> 20:19.199
It's a perennial flowering plant.

20:19.234 --> 20:21.333
Extracts were used for
perfume in the 16th Century,

20:21.369 --> 20:23.169
but now it's sometimes
put in different types

20:23.204 --> 20:25.271
- of sleep aids.
- Right...

20:27.642 --> 20:31.010
um,
I'm not just stressed out about Morgan.

20:31.046 --> 20:33.479
Can we talk about what
happened at Maggie's?

20:33.514 --> 20:35.247
When I mentioned your
insulin in front of Jade...

20:35.283 --> 20:36.715
And Clay.

20:36.750 --> 20:38.884
So you are upset.

20:38.919 --> 20:40.286
It wasn't that big of a deal,

20:40.321 --> 20:41.720
and they didn't think so either.

20:41.755 --> 20:43.122
But now they're gonna
look at me differently.

20:43.157 --> 20:44.523
- No they're not!
- Yes, they are.

20:44.559 --> 20:46.058
Because it does make me different.

20:46.094 --> 20:47.460
Yeah, it makes you different,

20:47.495 --> 20:48.860
the way you deal with your diabetes,

20:48.896 --> 20:50.262
the way you don't let it rule your life.

20:50.298 --> 20:52.798
It makes you one of the
strongest people I know.

20:52.833 --> 20:55.500
So it shouldn't have to be a secret.

20:57.471 --> 21:00.371
Well, thanks, but that's up to me.

21:00.407 --> 21:05.010
So in the future just don't
say anything to anybody, okay?

21:05.045 --> 21:06.444
Okay.

21:08.949 --> 21:10.681
This was a good idea.

21:10.717 --> 21:12.417
Thanks for twisting my arm.

21:12.452 --> 21:14.846
More like the other way around.

21:15.888 --> 21:17.534
You ready for another?

21:18.858 --> 21:20.358
I think we should stick to one.

21:20.393 --> 21:22.825
- We are in training.
- Yeah.

21:23.430 --> 21:26.497
Although I wonder if we're
making too much of this rodeo.

21:26.532 --> 21:27.865
What?!

21:27.900 --> 21:30.601
This is it, this is the pros.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.202
Yeah...

21:32.238 --> 21:33.738
Doesn't it feel a bit wrong,

21:33.773 --> 21:35.906
after what happened to all those horses?

21:35.942 --> 21:37.341
I mean...

21:37.376 --> 21:40.044
Maybe it should've been called off.

21:40.079 --> 21:41.746
- Oh my God.
- What?

21:41.781 --> 21:43.880
- You're scared.
- No, I'm not!

21:43.915 --> 21:46.750
I get it,
20 isn't exactly young for a bronc rider

21:46.785 --> 21:48.952
- who just got his permit.
- Whatever.

21:48.987 --> 21:50.354
And there's tons of guys your age

21:50.389 --> 21:52.322
who are already winning in the pros.

21:52.358 --> 21:55.292
- Who says I won't win?
- Your first time out?

21:55.327 --> 21:57.127
My uncle Hank did.

21:57.163 --> 22:00.329
Oh yeah, your uncle, I forgot.

22:00.365 --> 22:02.512
He was a legend.

22:03.334 --> 22:04.934
And you're worried you
won't live up to him.

22:04.970 --> 22:06.369
That's enough!

22:06.404 --> 22:07.937
Hey, ease off, I'm just saying,

22:07.973 --> 22:11.274
it's-it's probably not
easy being a McMurtry.

22:11.309 --> 22:13.710
You're trying to get inside my head.

22:13.745 --> 22:17.246
God, why does everything have
to be a competition between us?

22:17.282 --> 22:19.415
I don't know, but I keep winning.

22:19.450 --> 22:21.083
No, you don't.

22:21.118 --> 22:22.818
I was the first one to get a sponsor,

22:22.853 --> 22:24.887
I was the first one to win
a buckle in the amateurs,

22:24.922 --> 22:28.291
and now I'm the first one to
have a big news story on me.

22:28.326 --> 22:30.293
What have you done first?

22:32.296 --> 22:34.496
Well, what?

22:55.138 --> 22:57.538
- I can see what you're doing.
- Oh!

22:59.009 --> 23:01.042
Don't scare me like that, please.

23:01.077 --> 23:02.809
I didn't think you'd
miss a couple pieces

23:02.845 --> 23:03.793
of leftover chicken.

23:03.859 --> 23:06.840
That's not what I'm talking about,
and you know it.

23:07.583 --> 23:09.216
Here we go.

23:10.418 --> 23:13.487
Hustling around trying to
take care of everyone else,

23:13.523 --> 23:15.356
You're hoping it'll
somehow make up for this.

23:15.391 --> 23:17.024
It won't, I already know that.

23:17.059 --> 23:20.260
Well, how about what you lost here?

23:20.295 --> 23:22.295
That bridle you were
trying to clean today,

23:22.330 --> 23:24.330
that's from one of your horses,
isn't it?

23:24.366 --> 23:25.766
I just bought the horses, Jack,

23:25.801 --> 23:27.500
it's not like we had some bond.

23:27.536 --> 23:30.837
I don't believe that, not for a minute.

23:37.712 --> 23:39.345
One of mine survived.

23:40.547 --> 23:42.348
I'm the only one.

23:42.384 --> 23:44.250
How ironic is that?

23:45.887 --> 23:49.922
I'm the one that made the
deal with Caldwell, and...

23:49.957 --> 23:52.858
and everybody else lost everything.

23:56.064 --> 23:57.963
Is everything okay?

23:57.999 --> 24:00.199
Yeah, I was just checking up on Morgan.

24:00.234 --> 24:04.603
Yeah, um, he's with the other horses...
in the barn.

24:04.638 --> 24:06.205
He's inside the barn?

24:06.240 --> 24:07.972
Amy, he'll be terrified in there!

24:08.008 --> 24:11.910
No Dad, he's not.
He's bonded with Spartan,

24:11.945 --> 24:13.378
and that's why I put him in
the barn in the first place.

24:13.414 --> 24:14.913
They're stalled beside each other,

24:14.948 --> 24:16.281
and he seems totally fine.

24:16.317 --> 24:17.716
Well, you should've asked me first!

24:17.751 --> 24:19.951
Oh come on Tim,
you're being overprotective.

24:19.986 --> 24:22.454
You know horses need to
be with other horses.

24:22.489 --> 24:24.956
Exactly, Morgan lost his family,

24:24.991 --> 24:27.425
so here's a chance for us
to give him another one.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.992
I hope you're okay with that.

24:30.864 --> 24:32.197
There's not a whole hell of a lot

24:32.232 --> 24:34.332
I can do about it now, is there?!

24:44.544 --> 24:46.977
Here they come, here's Spartan.

24:47.012 --> 24:49.079
Okay, Spartan, you go say hi.

24:49.115 --> 24:50.481
Good boy, come on.

24:52.285 --> 24:54.418
- Should I let him out now?
- Yeah.

24:54.454 --> 24:56.320
We'll just take it nice and slow.

24:56.356 --> 24:58.889
Okay. Come on, Morgan.

25:04.596 --> 25:06.496
All right.

25:07.967 --> 25:10.467
Come on, bud,
time to meet some new friends.

25:10.502 --> 25:11.935
Hi.

25:15.674 --> 25:17.340
Good boy.

25:20.479 --> 25:22.979
This'll give them a chance
to get used to Morgan.

25:23.014 --> 25:24.781
You know, horses are a lot like people.

25:24.816 --> 25:26.182
You put them in a small space,

25:26.217 --> 25:27.950
and they're forced to
get to know each other.

25:31.389 --> 25:33.355
Especially when there's food involved.

25:37.388 --> 25:39.581
So do you think you can get
me a list of all the broncs

25:39.663 --> 25:42.064
so we can have it, it'll be ready to go?

25:42.100 --> 25:43.599
- Mhmm.
- Tim Fleming, right?

25:43.634 --> 25:45.768
- Yeah.
- I'm Ally Swanson.

25:45.804 --> 25:47.169
Yeah, I know who you are.

25:47.204 --> 25:50.038
We'll-I'll get back to you.
Okay, Tim.

25:50.073 --> 25:52.474
So?

25:52.510 --> 25:54.410
What,
you're here to get my side of the story?

25:54.445 --> 25:56.578
Oh, that.

25:56.614 --> 25:58.146
Well, I was just reporting
what people were saying.

25:58.182 --> 26:00.081
Whether it's true or not?

26:00.117 --> 26:02.184
You think I like covering
stories like this?!

26:02.219 --> 26:03.985
Well, you're here, so...

26:04.021 --> 26:06.521
do you wanna get me on camera
trying to defend myself?

26:06.556 --> 26:08.656
I'm doing a story on Jade.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.226
I want to interview her coach.

26:11.261 --> 26:13.061
We don't have to talk
about the fire at all.

26:13.096 --> 26:14.462
Yeah well, you've already said enough,

26:14.497 --> 26:16.198
pointing fingers, making accusations,

26:16.233 --> 26:17.899
not even thinking about
how it affects people

26:17.935 --> 26:19.767
- in this community.
- Hey!

26:19.803 --> 26:22.002
If there was any way I
could make this better...

26:22.038 --> 26:25.606
Right, how about you just stop...
making it worse.

26:27.610 --> 26:29.811
I have work to do.

26:35.352 --> 26:38.953
Glad you're up for
another post practice bevy.

26:38.988 --> 26:42.756
Yeah, I think we should talk
about what happened yesterday.

26:42.791 --> 26:45.326
- Oh...
- And a beer might help.

26:46.245 --> 26:48.329
I don't know if there's
much to talk about.

26:48.364 --> 26:50.364
I mean, actions speak louder than words.

26:50.399 --> 26:53.266
I think we may have got
swept up in the moment.

26:53.301 --> 26:56.770
I think we both know there's
more to it than just that.

26:56.805 --> 27:00.039
The truth is, I've always
wanted a girl who was my equal.

27:00.075 --> 27:01.808
Isn't that setting the bar kind of low?

27:03.479 --> 27:04.845
Whoa!

27:04.880 --> 27:06.312
Didn't anybody ever tell
you not to get so friendly

27:06.348 --> 27:08.515
with the competition?

27:08.550 --> 27:11.284
I'm just messing with you.

27:11.319 --> 27:13.052
- I'm Colt.
- Clay.

27:13.088 --> 27:15.054
- And this is Jade.
- Jade, yeah.

27:15.090 --> 27:16.923
Yeah, we heard all about her.

27:16.958 --> 27:18.358
Both of you, actually.

27:18.393 --> 27:19.566
Real up n' comers.

27:19.665 --> 27:22.996
Well, let us be the first
to welcome you to the pros.

27:23.031 --> 27:24.430
Care to do a shot?

27:24.465 --> 27:26.732
Uh,
actually I think we're okay with beer.

27:26.768 --> 27:28.801
Leave that for the amateurs, come on.

27:28.836 --> 27:30.703
Come on, one shot.

27:30.738 --> 27:32.605
All right!

27:32.640 --> 27:35.608
It's okay, Adam,
you're only like five minutes late.

27:35.643 --> 27:37.443
Yeah. Okay, see you soon.

27:37.478 --> 27:39.445
Bye.

27:39.480 --> 27:41.647
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hey.

27:43.217 --> 27:44.816
Cup of Joe?

27:44.851 --> 27:46.184
Are you excited for your wedding?

27:46.220 --> 27:47.852
Yes, I am.

27:47.888 --> 27:50.155
You know what they say,
second time's a charm.

27:50.190 --> 27:52.791
Isn't the saying, third time's a charm?

27:52.826 --> 27:54.192
No... well...

27:54.228 --> 27:57.662
yeah, but not in my case, hopefully.

28:03.470 --> 28:05.169
Yo.

28:05.204 --> 28:07.639
Whoa, whoa! Just slow down, Clay.

28:07.674 --> 28:10.341
What do you mean, Jade's sick?

28:10.376 --> 28:12.444
She drank what?!

28:13.947 --> 28:16.213
Hold tight, I'll be right there.

28:16.249 --> 28:18.249
- What's wrong with Jade?
- She's an idiot.

28:18.284 --> 28:20.151
Drank some seriously strong stuff,

28:20.186 --> 28:21.518
and now she's puking her guts out.

28:21.554 --> 28:22.954
Wait, I'm coming with you.

28:22.989 --> 28:24.488
I'll text Adam.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.170
He seems relaxed.

28:40.205 --> 28:41.572
Morgan's a whole different horse

28:41.607 --> 28:42.973
since we brought him in the barn.

28:43.008 --> 28:44.374
Don't gloat.

28:45.456 --> 28:47.177
I'm just saying I think the other horses

28:47.212 --> 28:50.213
have really helped bring
his anxiety level down.

28:50.248 --> 28:51.781
As a matter of fact,

28:51.816 --> 28:54.817
Georgie thought that she should
ride Morgan in the rodeo.

28:54.853 --> 28:56.119
Not gonna happen.

28:56.154 --> 28:57.636
Dad...

28:58.190 --> 29:00.957
Amy, we don't even know how
much smoke he's inhaled.

29:00.993 --> 29:03.059
I know, and...

29:03.095 --> 29:04.894
that's why I told her it was a bad idea,

29:04.929 --> 29:06.261
and I already shot it down.

29:06.297 --> 29:08.194
Okay, good.

29:08.766 --> 29:10.700
So why are we talking about it?

29:11.591 --> 29:14.069
Because I know that you're
looking for something...

29:14.105 --> 29:16.506
to help everyone move on.

29:16.541 --> 29:20.510
And I think that Morgan
should be a part of the rodeo.

29:20.545 --> 29:22.878
He needs to be a part of it.

29:24.348 --> 29:26.448
And you know what that something is?

29:28.419 --> 29:31.720
I just think that seeing
Morgan is the one thing

29:31.755 --> 29:34.623
that's gonna move everyone past this.

29:49.090 --> 29:51.189
Hey, come on! You're-you're late!

29:51.225 --> 29:53.225
What-I've gotta get all this
stuff over to the chutes!

29:53.260 --> 29:55.427
I was havin' coffee.

29:55.462 --> 29:57.161
Seriously? That's your excuse?!

29:57.197 --> 29:58.996
With the Fire Marshall.

29:59.032 --> 30:01.199
They found the cause of the fire.

30:01.235 --> 30:03.401
Turns out they were doing
some lighting upgrades

30:03.437 --> 30:04.836
over there recently,

30:04.871 --> 30:07.839
and whoever the electrician was, well...

30:07.874 --> 30:09.807
he made a mistake.

30:12.045 --> 30:14.879
- That's what he said?
- That's what he knows.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.081
Faulty wiring.

30:17.117 --> 30:18.482
It wasn't Vern's fault,

30:18.517 --> 30:21.452
and it sure as hell wasn't yours!

30:34.800 --> 30:36.634
Whoa!

30:36.669 --> 30:40.270
Whoa, you look way worse than yesterday.

30:40.305 --> 30:41.938
Thank you.

30:41.974 --> 30:44.975
Do you even remember Caleb
and I taking you home?

30:45.010 --> 30:46.828
Yeah... sort of.

30:48.313 --> 30:50.814
You reek, too.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.615
You can't ride like this.

30:53.567 --> 30:55.585
I'm not gonna let some...

30:55.620 --> 30:56.986
little hangover get in the way,

30:57.021 --> 30:59.255
I've worked way too hard for that.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.923
Little hangover?!

31:00.958 --> 31:02.992
You're completely out of it!

31:03.838 --> 31:06.362
You could get killed,
what were you thinking?

31:06.398 --> 31:08.731
I didn't know how strong that stuff was,
okay?

31:08.767 --> 31:10.633
Neither did Clay, we were just...

31:10.669 --> 31:13.202
hanging out, having a beer, and then...

31:13.237 --> 31:16.105
ugh, those guys showed
up with stuff that was...

31:16.140 --> 31:18.740
stronger than paint remover.

31:18.776 --> 31:20.276
Wait a second.

31:20.311 --> 31:22.885
You were hanging out...

31:23.580 --> 31:25.281
with Clay?

31:28.052 --> 31:29.651
Is there something going
on between you two, or...

31:29.687 --> 31:31.687
Girls.

31:31.722 --> 31:35.023
Hey, come on, this rodeo's startin' up!

31:37.227 --> 31:38.794
Wow, have...

31:38.829 --> 31:40.161
Have you been drinking?!

31:40.197 --> 31:42.410
No... not today.

31:42.999 --> 31:44.366
I can't believe this.

31:44.401 --> 31:45.934
What, don't be all hypocritical.

31:45.969 --> 31:47.969
I remember plenty of morning afters,

31:48.004 --> 31:50.004
where I shouldn'tve
even gotten on a horse.

31:50.040 --> 31:51.472
But you did, didn't you?

31:51.507 --> 31:53.774
The last time I rode with a hangover,

31:53.810 --> 31:55.276
I got racked up.

31:55.312 --> 31:58.546
It turned my life upside down,
I lost everything!

31:59.701 --> 32:01.316
You wanna say I'm a hypocrite,
that's fine.

32:01.351 --> 32:03.217
I'm being called a lot
worse than that lately.

32:03.252 --> 32:05.953
I'm pulling you from the event.

32:05.988 --> 32:08.088
I can't believe you, Jade!

32:08.123 --> 32:10.157
I can't believe it!

32:17.734 --> 32:19.266
What were you trying to pull?!

32:19.301 --> 32:21.001
I'm sorry, it's not something I...

32:21.036 --> 32:22.402
Yeah, right!

32:22.437 --> 32:23.677
Were you in on it with those guys,

32:23.776 --> 32:26.018
trying to get Jade sick so
she couldn't compete today?

32:26.051 --> 32:27.222
What? Of course not.

32:27.305 --> 32:29.743
Georgie, please calm down,
I feel terrible about this.

32:29.778 --> 32:32.112
I don't wanna to hear it.

32:34.250 --> 32:35.948
Hey.

32:35.984 --> 32:37.350
Hey.

32:37.386 --> 32:39.151
- What was that about?
- Oh, nothing.

32:39.187 --> 32:41.701
Just wishing him luck today.

32:42.791 --> 32:44.391
Really?
I thought you didn't even like that guy.

32:44.426 --> 32:46.426
It-it's not important. Um...

32:47.374 --> 32:49.863
could I get you to video
Morgan and I today?

32:49.898 --> 32:51.697
On my iPad?

32:51.732 --> 32:54.233
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

32:59.607 --> 33:00.973
Ladies and gentleman,

33:01.009 --> 33:03.876
please direct your
attention to our infield.

33:03.912 --> 33:05.378
We're gonna kick this thing off

33:05.413 --> 33:07.880
by congratulating the newest member

33:07.915 --> 33:10.482
of the Foothills Cowboy Hall of Fame,

33:10.518 --> 33:13.585
Hudson's very own, Jack Bartlett.

33:23.431 --> 33:26.064
Thank you. Thank you very much.

33:28.101 --> 33:30.201
I've gotta say...

33:30.237 --> 33:32.570
I didn't expect that the first time

33:32.605 --> 33:34.739
I spoke as a hall of famer

33:34.774 --> 33:38.411
would be under these circumstances.

33:40.647 --> 33:43.448
I'd like to take this
opportunity to offer

33:43.483 --> 33:46.150
my condolences to all the fine people

33:46.185 --> 33:48.820
who lost so much in that fire.

33:51.157 --> 33:53.658
And we've asked the
owners of those horses

33:53.693 --> 33:55.693
to join us in the arena today.

34:05.004 --> 34:08.172
Horses are like family to rodeo people.

34:09.193 --> 34:12.476
And rodeo people are
like one big family.

34:13.563 --> 34:15.277
So in a sense...

34:16.234 --> 34:19.483
we've all shared in this loss.

34:26.123 --> 34:28.373
All the owners, please.

35:01.559 --> 35:03.525
Together...

35:03.560 --> 35:06.294
let's join in a moment of silence,

35:06.330 --> 35:09.231
to commemorate the
lives of these horses.

35:09.266 --> 35:13.035
The family members we all just lost.

35:48.438 --> 35:49.903
Thank you.

35:52.721 --> 35:56.877
You probably all know that
there was one brave horse

35:56.912 --> 36:00.313
that managed to survive this tragedy,

36:00.348 --> 36:04.785
and I'd like to introduce
you all to him right now.

36:04.820 --> 36:07.387
Please welcome Morgan!

36:20.135 --> 36:22.202
Woo-hoo, Morgan!

36:33.581 --> 36:35.314
Yeah, Morgan, go!

37:01.483 --> 37:03.412
Hey, at least you got to right.

37:03.535 --> 37:04.934
I know, I just...

37:04.969 --> 37:06.336
I wanted to beat those guys so bad

37:06.371 --> 37:08.838
for how they duped us.

37:08.873 --> 37:11.640
Well, that was your first
try at the big leagues.

37:11.675 --> 37:13.242
What'd you expect?

37:13.277 --> 37:14.609
I mean, you didn't seriously think

37:14.645 --> 37:16.011
you were gonna beat me, did you?

37:16.047 --> 37:17.679
I would've settled for
anywhere in the money.

37:17.715 --> 37:19.514
Huh.

37:20.952 --> 37:22.684
- Jade!
- Uh-oh.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.219
This is not gonna be good.

37:24.254 --> 37:25.787
Why didn't you ride?

37:25.823 --> 37:27.556
You're the one who sold me
on doing this news piece,

37:27.591 --> 37:30.158
and now I don't even have one!

37:30.193 --> 37:32.461
Yeah, you do.

37:32.496 --> 37:33.862
Why don't you tell your viewers

37:33.897 --> 37:36.465
how these rodeo people
rallied back from a tragedy?

37:36.500 --> 37:37.999
I know, and I'm going to,

37:38.034 --> 37:39.668
because it's an important
story to tell...

37:39.703 --> 37:41.102
Good, it'll make up for the mess

37:41.137 --> 37:43.637
- you made in the first place.
- Look, I'm sorry.

37:43.673 --> 37:46.074
And I am going to set
the record straight.

37:46.109 --> 37:48.243
I just wish I didn't spend all that time

37:48.278 --> 37:51.145
covering a courageous
female bronc rider,

37:51.181 --> 37:54.349
who just ended up dropping out!

37:54.384 --> 37:56.351
- Wait...
- No, you wait.

37:56.386 --> 37:58.598
She's right, come here.

37:59.221 --> 38:01.722
Things have to change
around here and quick.

38:01.758 --> 38:03.156
This time it really wasn't my fault.

38:03.192 --> 38:05.259
I don't wanna hear it Jade, no excuses.

38:05.294 --> 38:07.361
I'm sorry that I wasn't
there for the past few days,

38:07.397 --> 38:10.010
but that's not an excuse.

38:10.500 --> 38:13.267
Next time you wanna keep
up with the big boys,

38:13.302 --> 38:14.868
do it in that arena.

38:15.860 --> 38:18.205
- You got it?
- Yeah.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.672
Good.

38:25.080 --> 38:26.446
Hey!

38:26.481 --> 38:27.847
Oh, here Georgie, I'll load him.

38:27.883 --> 38:29.783
Oh, thanks.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.734
So, did you get it?

38:32.816 --> 38:35.755
Yeah, it was pretty amazing,
I'm really proud of you.

38:35.791 --> 38:37.524
Thanks, I'm glad to hear that.

38:37.559 --> 38:39.893
Um... so you're not still mad at me

38:39.928 --> 38:42.228
for slipping up, are you?

38:42.263 --> 38:44.964
No, I'm not. You were probably right.

38:44.999 --> 38:47.333
I shouldn't keep my diabetes a secret.

38:47.368 --> 38:48.901
You shouldn't,
and maybe you'll be happier

38:48.937 --> 38:50.436
now that it isn't.

38:50.471 --> 38:52.939
So is this where I say thank you?

38:52.974 --> 38:55.037
You're welcome.

38:56.444 --> 38:59.445
Um... give me a sec.

39:40.152 --> 39:42.553
So why'd you stand me up
at Maggie's yesterday?

39:42.589 --> 39:44.254
Oh, it-it's a long story,

39:44.290 --> 39:45.690
I don't really feel
like getting into it,

39:45.725 --> 39:47.492
is that okay?

39:47.527 --> 39:49.594
Yeah, of course.

39:49.629 --> 39:51.562
But I wanna make it up to you, so...

39:51.598 --> 39:53.430
can we head to Maggie's tonight?

39:53.466 --> 39:54.831
You know...

39:54.867 --> 39:57.401
I think I'm gonna get going.

39:57.436 --> 39:59.236
I'll see you later.

39:59.271 --> 40:00.704
Yeah, sure.

40:12.417 --> 40:13.984
I heard about that
little stunt you pulled

40:14.019 --> 40:16.401
with my riders.

40:17.088 --> 40:18.955
You want a piece of me, I'm right here.

40:18.991 --> 40:21.190
Here.

40:21.226 --> 40:23.593
That's half of what everybody won.

40:23.629 --> 40:25.161
I hope it helps.

40:26.831 --> 40:29.032
What Bartlett said, he's right.

40:29.067 --> 40:31.520
We need to stick together.

40:34.439 --> 40:36.639
Thank you.

40:45.883 --> 40:47.850
Okay, bud.

40:58.828 --> 41:00.862
You were right about Morgan.

41:00.897 --> 41:03.065
He needs a family.

41:03.100 --> 41:05.400
And now he has one again.

41:12.776 --> 41:14.861
Thank you for helping me.

41:15.745 --> 41:17.645
Put everything together.

41:19.983 --> 41:21.348
You never lost focus,

41:21.384 --> 41:23.865
even with everything
you were going through.

41:26.623 --> 41:29.390
I think you're the
strongest man I've ever met.

41:29.425 --> 41:30.925
Ugh!

41:32.595 --> 41:34.195
I was crying like a baby out there

41:34.230 --> 41:36.872
during that moment of silence.

41:37.833 --> 41:40.134
Especially because of that.

41:49.678 --> 41:51.444
So the rodeo went well?

41:51.480 --> 41:53.348
That's great.

41:53.716 --> 41:56.249
You still look a little down though,
Amy.

41:56.284 --> 41:57.651
Yeah...

41:57.686 --> 41:59.486
Yeah, I'm feeling better about things.

41:59.521 --> 42:02.789
I just...
it's really tough without you here.

42:04.259 --> 42:05.587
I get it.

42:05.702 --> 42:08.828
I mean, Bob isn't the only
thing keeping me up at night.

42:08.863 --> 42:10.997
I wanna be home with you.

42:11.032 --> 42:14.541
Put my hands on your belly,
and feel our baby kicking.

42:15.811 --> 42:19.175
I lay awake every night
thinking about these things.

42:20.342 --> 42:21.707
You know, uh...

42:21.743 --> 42:23.743
you know that shirt of yours,
my favorite?

42:23.778 --> 42:25.244
Um...

42:25.279 --> 42:27.847
oh, the blue plaid one?

42:27.882 --> 42:29.448
You took it with you?!

42:29.483 --> 42:31.117
It's the only thing that helps me sleep.

42:32.586 --> 42:34.954
Ty, I have been looking
everywhere for that shirt.

42:34.989 --> 42:36.956
Well, it's not like it would
fit you right now anyways.

42:36.991 --> 42:39.324
Hey Ty, we need you.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.293
That is probably true.

42:42.929 --> 42:45.096
I gotta go, Amy.

42:45.132 --> 42:46.731
I love you.

42:46.767 --> 42:48.433
I love you, too.
