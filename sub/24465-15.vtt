00:23.560 --> 00:25.260
LOOK, I JUST WANT TO THANK

00:25.360 --> 00:27.380
EVERYBODY FOR TRAINING SO HARD.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.180
YOU'RE DOING A REAL GOOD JOB,

00:29.280 --> 00:32.720
AND I THINK WE'RE IN GREAT SHAPE
FOR THE DODGEBALL TOURNAMENT

00:31.920 --> 00:34.320

AS LONG AS MORDECAI KEEPS

00:35.080 --> 00:36.500

00:36.600 --> 00:37.940
Mordecai: AWW, NAW.

00:38.040 --> 00:38.900
All: YEAH!

00:39.000 --> 00:39.820
Thomas: YEAH, MAN.

00:39.920 --> 00:43.280

Rigby: YEAH, THE TORNADO!

00:44.520 --> 00:47.520
WHERE'D YOU LEARN THAT?
YOU WERE LIKE, "WHAM!"

00:46.320 --> 00:47.060
Hi Five: ( LAUGHS )

00:47.160 --> 00:50.040

TORNADOS FLEW BY MY HEAD, AND IT

00:51.200 --> 00:52.100
WAS ALL LIKE,

00:52.200 --> 00:55.400
"WHOOâWHOOâWHOOâWHOOâWHOOâWHOO!"
( LAUGHTER )

00:54.480 --> 00:55.220
IT'S TRUE!

00:55.320 --> 00:57.140
Benson: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.660
JUST SIMMER DOWN, NOW.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.620
WE'VE ALL BEEN PLAYING GREAT,

01:00.720 --> 01:01.540
ALL RIGHT?

01:01.640 --> 01:03.020
( ALL TALKING )

01:03.120 --> 01:05.300
BUT, IF I HAD TO BE <i>TOTALLY</i>

01:05.400 --> 01:07.500
HONEST HERE, I THINK WE COULD

01:07.600 --> 01:09.660
ALL STAND TO LEARN A LITTLE

01:09.760 --> 01:12.180
SOMETHING FROM THIS GUY, RIGHT

01:12.280 --> 01:13.860
HERE.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.780
I think you're better than all

01:16.880 --> 01:18.740
of these guys here.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.020
Mordecai: ( CHUCKLES )

01:20.120 --> 01:20.820
THANKS, MAN.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.460
Skips: HEY, TAKE IT EASY ON

01:22.560 --> 01:23.580
THOSE WINGS, BENSON.

01:23.680 --> 01:24.740
YOU MIGHT STILL HAVE A

01:24.840 --> 01:28.120
CONCUSSION FROM PRACTICE.
Benson: NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:27.720 --> 01:28.700
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.620
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:29.720 --> 01:31.180
I'M JUST GONNA GO AHEAD AND SAY

01:31.280 --> 01:33.560

I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD

01:32.840 --> 01:34.260
SHOT OF WINNING THE TOURNAMENT

01:34.360 --> 01:34.940
THIS YEAR.

01:35.040 --> 01:38.760
SURE WE HAVEN'T WON THIS THING
IN 10 YEARS, BUT THIS IS OUR

01:38.840 --> 01:39.300
YEAR!

01:39.400 --> 01:41.020
BENSON'S BALLERZ ARE GONNA WIN

Benson: I'M SORRY!

01:44.840 --> 01:46.500
DID YOU GUYS JUST SAY "YEAH"?

01:46.600 --> 01:47.740
All: YEAH!!

01:47.840 --> 01:48.940
Benson: ALL RIGHT, THEN!

01:49.040 --> 01:51.520

01:58.120 --> 02:01.240
Mordecai: ALL RIGHT, DUDE.
YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO THROW IT

02:00.360 --> 02:03.320
THE RIGHT WAY THIS TIME?
Rigby: HMMâHMM! I GOT THIS.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.980
RIGNADO!

02:05.080 --> 02:06.700

Mordecai: UH...STILL NEEDS

02:10.040 --> 02:10.500
WORK.

02:10.600 --> 02:11.460
Benson: RIGBY! NO, NO!

02:11.560 --> 02:13.380
NO TORNADOES!

02:13.480 --> 02:16.520
HEY, A LITTLE HELP?

02:18.720 --> 02:19.180
UGH!

02:19.280 --> 02:23.420

02:31.760 --> 02:32.820
Rigby: DUDE, WHAT'S YOUR

02:32.920 --> 02:35.200

Mordecai: C.J. IS HERE.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.640
Rigby: ARE YOU GUYS GONNA
MAKE OUT AND RUN AWAY FROM EACH

02:36.760 --> 02:39.400
OTHER AGAIN?
Mordecai: DUDE, QUIT IT!

02:38.400 --> 02:41.440
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE WE
KISSED ON NEW YEAR'S EVE, AND I

02:40.560 --> 02:43.640
FEEL WEIRD AROUND HER.
LIKE SHE STILL HATES ME FOR THE

02:42.800 --> 02:45.760
WHOLE MOVIE MIXâUP WITH
MARGARET.

02:44.360 --> 02:47.520
Rigby: THEN JUST GO TALK TO
HER ABOUT IT.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.180
Mordecai: NO! UGH!

02:47.280 --> 02:50.440
MAN, I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO
FOCUS WITH HER HERE.

02:49.360 --> 02:52.560
WHAT IF SHE DISTRACTS ME AND I
MESS UP?

02:51.080 --> 02:52.060
Rigby: DUDE, WHATEVER.

02:52.160 --> 02:52.860
HER TEAM IS NEW.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.200
THEY'LL PROBABLY GET ELIMINATED
IN, LIKE, TWO SECONDS.

02:55.200 --> 02:55.980
Mordecai: YEAH.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.380
I GUESS I'LL JUST TRY TO AVOID

02:57.480 --> 02:59.760
HER.
Benson: COME ON, YOU TWO!

02:58.880 --> 03:01.840
THE GAME'S ABOUT TO START!
BENSON'S BALLERZ NEEDS THEIR

( CHEERING )

03:04.400 --> 03:05.660
ALL RIGHT, DODGEBALLERS.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.380
IF YOU GET HIT, CROSS THE CENTER

03:07.480 --> 03:08.980
LINE, OR AN OPPOSING PLAYER

03:09.080 --> 03:10.420
CATCHES YOUR BALL, YOU'RE OUT!

03:10.520 --> 03:12.020

05:17.120 --> 05:18.420
Benson: UGH, MORDECAI!

05:18.520 --> 05:19.500
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

05:19.600 --> 05:22.880
Mordecai: IT'S COMPLICATED,
OKAY?!

05:21.440 --> 05:22.660
Hi Five: HEY, WE'RE PLAYING

I CAN'T DO THIS!

05:34.160 --> 05:35.340
Benson: HEY. HEY!

05:35.440 --> 05:37.180
THE ONLY THING WE CAN'T DO IS

05:37.280 --> 05:37.820

05:37.920 --> 05:38.940
WE'VE ALREADY BEAT

05:39.040 --> 05:40.780
THE MAGICAL ELEMENTS!

05:40.880 --> 05:43.340
WE'VE COME TOO FAR TO BACK DOWN

06:16.640 --> 06:21.220
UGH! THEY'RE CRUSHING US!

06:21.320 --> 06:23.260
Benson: WHAT IS HE DOING?!

06:23.360 --> 06:26.000

06:35.480 --> 06:38.980
FINISH HER SO WE CAN WIN THIS!

06:39.080 --> 06:41.260
( Distorted ) FINISH HER!

06:41.360 --> 06:42.340

WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

07:17.080 --> 07:20.700
( BOTH GRUNTING )

07:20.800 --> 07:23.420
MORDECAI AND C.J., <i>YOUHAVE</i>

07:26.320 --> 07:27.180
Mordecai: THE WHAT?

07:27.280 --> 07:30.440
THE INTERGALACTIC DODGEBALL
COUNCIL, DUH!

07:29.520 --> 07:30.900
THE REASON THAT YOU'RE HERE

07:31.000 --> 07:34.160
IS BECAUSE YOU'VE REACHED AN
INFINITE STANDâOFF AND WE

07:33.400 --> 07:34.780
BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE UNABLE TO

07:34.880 --> 07:38.200
KNOCK EACH OTHER OUT BECAUSE
YOU'RE AVOIDING YOUR HISTORY

07:37.680 --> 07:40.120
TOGETHER.
( SCOFFS ) WHAT?

07:39.520 --> 07:40.900
WE'RE NOT AVOIDING OUR HISTORY

07:41.720 --> 07:42.700
I MEAN, LIKE...

07:42.800 --> 07:46.000
Mordecai: YEAH, WE DON'T EVEN
<i>HAVEA HISTORY TOGETHER.</i>

07:45.440 --> 07:46.620
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,

07:46.720 --> 07:48.140
RIGHT?

07:48.240 --> 07:49.340
OH, YEAH.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.620
WE DON'T EVEN <i>HAVEA HISTORY</i>

07:51.720 --> 07:52.460
TOGETHER.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.500
YOU'RE DODGING THE FACTS.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.700
YES. WHY ARE YOU DODGING?

07:57.800 --> 07:59.300
LET US THEN VIEW A REPLAY OF

07:59.400 --> 08:04.900
YOUR HISTORY TOGETHER.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.660
UGH, GROSS! HOW OLD <i>AREYOU?</i>

08:07.760 --> 08:10.140
( BOTH LAUGH )

08:10.240 --> 08:12.100

08:12.200 --> 08:13.700
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

08:13.800 --> 08:14.980
ARE YOU JUST PLAYING?

08:15.080 --> 08:17.420
IS THIS A GAME TO YOU?!

08:17.520 --> 08:20.300
OH. THAT HISTORY.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.740
WE CAN STILL MAKE THE BEST OF

08:21.840 --> 08:24.200
THIS.
Mordecai: HUH?

08:23.040 --> 08:25.040
( SMOOCHES )

08:25.600 --> 08:27.460
Mordecai: ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.740
( EXHALES SHARPLY )

08:28.840 --> 08:30.700
EVERY TIME I SEE C.J., I MESS

08:30.800 --> 08:31.220
UP.

08:31.320 --> 08:34.400
I DIDN'T MEAN TO LEAD HER ON
WITH THE DATE OR THE KISS.

08:33.880 --> 08:34.540
BUT I DID.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.260
AND I UNDERSTAND WHY SHE'S MAD

08:36.360 --> 08:37.220
AT ME.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.180
WAIT!

08:38.280 --> 08:39.540
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU, MORDECAI.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.100
I WAS JUST EMBARRASSED BECAUSE

08:41.200 --> 08:42.500
OF THE WAY I TOOK OFF AFTER WE

08:42.600 --> 08:43.420
KISSED.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.180
I HONESTLY THOUGHT <i>YOUWERE MAD</i>

08:45.280 --> 08:45.820
AT <i>ME!</i>

08:45.920 --> 08:47.980
Mordecai: REALLY?

08:48.080 --> 08:49.500
I'M DEFINITELY NOT MAD AT

08:49.600 --> 08:51.920
YOU.
Mordecai: MAN, SOMETIMES I

08:51.520 --> 08:52.940
FEEL SO DUMB ABOUT THIS KIND OF

08:53.040 --> 08:53.540
STUFF.

08:53.640 --> 08:54.940
( LAUGHS ) YEAH, ME TOO.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.620
Mordecai: WELL...DO YOU WANT

08:56.720 --> 08:57.740
