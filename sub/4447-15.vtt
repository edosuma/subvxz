(narrator)
Previously on "Hellcats.."

00:02.583 --> 00:04.000
You sure
school's worth all this?

00:04.000 --> 00:05.417
Dan, I'm going to graduate

00:05.417 --> 00:06.792
pass the bar up north
and work in the DA's office.

00:06.792 --> 00:08.000
Are you applying
for scholarship?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.667
I have one now,
for cheerleading.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.042
- Cheerleading?
- Oh!

00:11.042 --> 00:13.042
Hello, Marti.
Welcome to Cheertown.

00:13.042 --> 00:15.209
I need two pre-law students
to help me.

00:15.209 --> 00:18.125
A man been sentenced
to life in prison
for a minor burglary.

00:18.125 --> 00:20.209
'Bill Marsh is a powerful man
at this school'

00:20.209 --> 00:21.875
and if we're gonna
go after him, I need
concrete proof.

00:21.875 --> 00:23.167
- Jake?
- Jake?

00:23.167 --> 00:24.458
(Marti)
'So they caught Jake on tape'

00:24.458 --> 00:25.583
and Marsh had Overton

00:25.583 --> 00:28.750
cover it up and frame Travis.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.250
[grunting]

00:30.250 --> 00:31.625
That's the man
you're trying to help?

00:31.625 --> 00:33.125
- 'Yeah.'
- You have to save him.

00:33.125 --> 00:36.333
I can free Travis
if I implicate Jake,
but it will bring down

00:36.333 --> 00:38.166
football and it will
bring down the Hellcats.

00:38.166 --> 00:41.084
Knowing all that we stand
to lose, do we have her back?

01:31.208 --> 01:33.917
I thought this might help
cheer you up.

01:33.917 --> 01:35.166
It's my secret happy place.

01:35.166 --> 01:37.291
I don't need cheering up,
okay?

01:37.291 --> 01:39.291
I'm absolutely..

01:43.209 --> 01:45.875
I'm sorry.
I lost my train of thought.

01:45.875 --> 01:48.917
You were in denial
about our impending doom.

01:48.917 --> 01:51.042
I don't believe we're doomed.

01:51.042 --> 01:52.708
Rome is burning, baby.

01:52.708 --> 01:55.209
Wake up
and smell the kerosene.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.083
Maybe.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.875
Once Marti makes
that DVD public

01:58.875 --> 02:00.917
football is coming down fast.

02:00.917 --> 02:02.834
It's taking
Lancer cheerleading with it.

02:02.834 --> 02:04.834
When God closes a door,
he opens a window.

02:04.834 --> 02:08.542
[scoffing]
And Savannah opens
the big book of   cliches.

02:09.667 --> 02:11.209
We've worked our asses off

02:11.209 --> 02:14.667
and we very likely
won't make it to nationals.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.917
And how do you plan to make up
for losing your scholarship?

02:17.917 --> 02:19.250
You think your parents
are gonna foot the bill

02:19.250 --> 02:20.959
for a secular school
like Lancer?

02:20.959 --> 02:23.583
You're doing a very bad job
at cheering me up.

02:23.583 --> 02:25.959
I hate when people hide
behind their religious beliefs

02:25.959 --> 02:29.167
and say, "Oh, everything
happens for a reason."

02:29.167 --> 02:32.042
Can't you just be pissed off
like a normal human being?

02:34.041 --> 02:35.125
If I have to leave school

02:35.125 --> 02:38.625
or...transfer back
to Mem-Chris

02:38.625 --> 02:41.041
it means there's something
better out there for me.

02:41.041 --> 02:44.375
And if there's not,
there's a good reason for it.

02:45.375 --> 02:48.625
- There's always a plan.
- Plan, schman.

02:48.625 --> 02:50.625
So you ladies are here
to play or to watch?

02:51.708 --> 02:53.708
A little of both, maybe.

02:55.167 --> 02:57.542
Our cheerleading squad
is throwing a party tonight

02:57.542 --> 02:59.166
over on the Lancer campus.

02:59.166 --> 03:00.667
We are?

03:00.667 --> 03:03.042
And we felt
it was our civic duty

03:03.042 --> 03:06.417
to invite
some genuine Memphis heroes.

03:07.166 --> 03:08.625
You interested in stopping by?

03:08.625 --> 03:10.667
Boy, I sure wish
we could, uh..

03:10.667 --> 03:12.084
But we're on a 24-hour shift.

03:12.084 --> 03:14.667
So no fun for us tonight.

03:14.667 --> 03:18.042
- That's too bad.
- Yes, it most definitely is.

03:19.834 --> 03:21.917
Pleasure meeting you ladies.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.583
Since when
are we having a party?

03:29.583 --> 03:31.083
Since I thought of it
a few seconds ago.

03:31.083 --> 03:34.208
You can't just unilaterally
decide to throw a party.

03:34.208 --> 03:36.583
Funny. I just did.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.083
Well, we have to consult
the other Hellcats

03:38.083 --> 03:39.542
come up with a theme.

03:39.542 --> 03:40.667
I mean, how am I supposed
to throw together

03:40.667 --> 03:42.417
a decent party by tonight?

03:42.417 --> 03:43.667
We'll wing it.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.333
Well, we have to have
some kind of plan.

03:45.333 --> 03:48.458
Huh. Talk to God.

03:48.458 --> 03:51.084
Maybe he's got a spare one
you can borrow.

03:51.084 --> 03:52.959
If that's a joke,
it's not funny.

03:54.166 --> 03:55.875
It doesn't even make sense.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.250
(Julian)
'This clearly implicates
the quarterback'

04:02.250 --> 04:05.042
but video that's been edited
is not admissible.

04:05.042 --> 04:07.166
Where's the original feed
from the security camera?

04:07.166 --> 04:08.250
I don't know.

04:08.250 --> 04:10.209
This is all Marsh had
in his safe.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.209
Well, we can't use this
in court, but we can use it

04:12.209 --> 04:14.084
to get the media
workin' for us.

04:14.084 --> 04:16.041
'We create a public stink,
put pressure on the governor'

04:16.041 --> 04:18.375
to commute Travis' conviction.

04:18.375 --> 04:19.916
Congratulations, you two.

04:19.916 --> 04:22.041
It's not gonna
happen overnight,
but it will happen.

04:22.041 --> 04:24.084
Travis is gonna be a free man.

04:24.084 --> 04:26.750
Can we take a beat first?

04:26.750 --> 04:28.167
Marti, I don't mind
you bringing

04:28.167 --> 04:30.209
your gym teacher along
as a security blanket

04:30.209 --> 04:32.667
but I would appreciate
if you'd keep her muzzled.

04:32.667 --> 04:34.084
Careful, counselor. I bite.

04:34.084 --> 04:36.000
Look, before we release
this video footage

04:36.000 --> 04:39.083
and destroy the lives
of a lot of innocent people

04:39.083 --> 04:41.959
I wanna make sure
there's not another way out

04:41.959 --> 04:43.959
'something
we haven't considered.'

04:43.959 --> 04:45.000
Just hear us out.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.750
[smirking]
I'm not havin'
this discussion.

04:47.750 --> 04:50.291
- Give me the DVD.
- Okay.

04:55.959 --> 04:57.708
What is this?

04:57.708 --> 04:59.167
I uploaded the footage
to the cloud

04:59.167 --> 05:00.250
and destroyed the original.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.458
You destroyed evidence?

05:01.458 --> 05:04.042
Evidence of her burglarizing
Bill Marsh's office.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.167
She'd have been a fool not to.

05:05.167 --> 05:08.250
My SkyDrive
has a restricted access.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.542
No one will see
this video again
unless I let them.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.000
Mm-hmm.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.417
Do you know the password?

05:14.417 --> 05:16.042
- Yes.
- Give it to me.

05:19.458 --> 05:22.000
- No.
- No?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
No, sir.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.208
What's your damn plan?

05:30.208 --> 05:32.084
We wanna bring Red Raymond
in on this.

05:32.084 --> 05:33.583
'Get his advice.'

05:33.583 --> 05:35.250
He's the football coach.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.750
Hell, w-why don't we just get
Bill Marsh on Skype right now?

05:37.750 --> 05:38.875
'We can cut off
the middleman.'

05:38.875 --> 05:40.291
Red wants a clean program.

05:40.291 --> 05:42.042
He wasn't here
when the cover-up happened.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.041
He's after
the same thing we are.

05:43.041 --> 05:45.000
- Allegedly.
- Vanessa trusts him.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.917
And that's,
that's good enough for me.

05:46.917 --> 05:48.375
'If there's even
a slightest chance'

05:48.375 --> 05:52.125
that we can save Travis
without destroying
the Hellcats..

05:52.125 --> 05:54.125
...we have to explore it.

05:54.125 --> 05:58.000
Lancer stands to lose...
a lot of good people.

06:01.208 --> 06:04.125
If this scandal blows up,
you're gonna have
to drop out, right?

06:06.542 --> 06:08.084
Pretty sure, yeah.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.917
For that reason
,and that reason alone..

06:13.625 --> 06:15.875
...you have my blessing.

06:18.041 --> 06:22.000
I...I don't know
what to say to that.

06:24.542 --> 06:26.041
Thank you.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.125
Well, there's actually
a second reason.

06:28.125 --> 06:29.542
I've been
carrying around a baggie

06:29.542 --> 06:31.042
full of shredded plastic
all morning

06:31.042 --> 06:33.834
just so you can
make a half-baked
theatrical gesture.

06:36.417 --> 06:38.458
That's the kind
of thing I'd do.

06:45.625 --> 06:47.166
What?

06:47.166 --> 06:48.875
Get a room.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.084
Hey, I'm so sorry
to be so secretive.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.167
Um, I'm sure
Vanessa filled you in.

07:00.167 --> 07:02.042
(Bill)
'Hello, Ms. Perkins.'

07:04.375 --> 07:05.542
Did you tell him?

07:05.542 --> 07:06.834
- Marti--
- You told him?

07:06.834 --> 07:08.041
Vanessa and I trusted you.

07:08.041 --> 07:10.500
I-I went out on a limb
with my law professor--

07:10.500 --> 07:11.834
Will you just listen?

07:12.959 --> 07:14.083
'There's too much at stake.'

07:14.083 --> 07:15.583
But I promise,
I will do everything

07:15.583 --> 07:16.750
I can to help your friend.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.417
Travis. His name
is Travis Guthrie.

07:18.417 --> 07:21.917
- We want to help Travis.
- Oh. You wanna help Travis?

07:21.917 --> 07:23.708
You had Travis framed
to cover up what Jake did.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.542
I'd rather focus
on the future.

07:26.542 --> 07:28.500
I have a small group
of key boosters

07:28.500 --> 07:29.834
looking to make an investment

07:29.834 --> 07:31.375
a significant investment

07:31.375 --> 07:32.959
'into professor Parrish's'

07:32.959 --> 07:34.667
'three-strikes project.'

07:34.667 --> 07:37.041
You folks will have everything
you need to fight
the good fight

07:37.041 --> 07:39.000
'including access
to the politicians'

07:39.000 --> 07:41.167
'you need to repeal the law.'

07:41.167 --> 07:43.125
It's a cause
near and dear to my heart.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.291
You'll be able to
save hundreds of people
down the line

07:45.291 --> 07:46.750
people like Travis.

07:46.750 --> 07:49.333
What about the actual Travis?

07:49.333 --> 07:50.959
What you're proposing
could take years.

07:50.959 --> 07:53.417
We'll spend money.
We'll twist arms.

07:53.417 --> 07:55.209
We'll do everything we can
to make it happen fast.

07:55.209 --> 07:57.000
In the meantime,
I'll make some calls.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.708
I'll have Travis transferred
to a minimum-security prison.

07:58.708 --> 07:59.917
We'll personally make sure

07:59.917 --> 08:02.042
that Travis has everything
that he needs.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.167
Except his freedom.

08:07.792 --> 08:10.042
That's the nature
of compromise.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.792
Look at you both.

08:15.792 --> 08:18.291
You are terrified
of the truth.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.959
You lie, you hurt people

08:20.959 --> 08:24.083
you blow smoke to cover it up
and nobody stops you

08:24.083 --> 08:26.792
because they're afraid
it'll destroy the system.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.167
Football..

08:29.167 --> 08:31.291
...is not too big to fail.

08:34.542 --> 08:37.042

08:56.125 --> 08:59.084
Can you write something
in my cheer scrapbook?

08:59.084 --> 09:01.125
- You keep a scrapbook?
- I started.

09:01.125 --> 09:03.792
'Bought a book,
put in some photos and stuff.'

09:03.792 --> 09:06.333
I don't want all this to end
without some kind of memento.

09:06.333 --> 09:09.042
Hm.

09:09.042 --> 09:11.625
Let me help out

09:11.625 --> 09:13.084
Nobody in your life

is ever gonna be impressed

'They're gonna smile politely'

09:19.166 --> 09:22.875

like me.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.000
Fine.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.291
I was only asking
to be polite.

09:26.291 --> 09:28.166
Whatever.

09:28.166 --> 09:32.167
- Hey. You okay?
- Right as rain.

09:32.167 --> 09:33.750
Well, if you need
to talk or anything, I'm--

09:33.750 --> 09:36.041
- I don't.
- Okay, try it.

09:36.041 --> 09:40.125
'Cause watching you
walk around here
pissin' people off..

09:40.125 --> 09:41.875
Yeah, not my idea
of a good time.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.167
What do you want me to do?

09:43.167 --> 09:44.125
Flit about hugging everyone
and telling 'em

09:44.125 --> 09:45.834
'how much
I'm gonna miss them?'

09:45.834 --> 09:48.042
Well, at least
it'd show you care.

09:48.042 --> 09:51.041
I know you care.
Come on. It's me.

09:54.542 --> 09:56.917
I hate this.

09:56.917 --> 09:58.083
I hate not being in control.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.959
The whole world
is crashing down around us.

09:59.959 --> 10:01.750
And there's nothing
we can do about it.

10:03.250 --> 10:06.167
Marti and Vanessa were
gonna go talk to
Red Raymond, alright?

10:06.167 --> 10:09.625
Uh, maybe he has a plan.

10:09.625 --> 10:10.875
Sitting around, waiting to see

10:10.875 --> 10:13.625
if I'm gonna be rescued
by other people?

10:13.625 --> 10:16.125
Not my idea of a good time.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.042
Right.

10:25.917 --> 10:29.209
[sighing]

10:32.084 --> 10:34.000
[sighing]

10:42.667 --> 10:45.708
[instrumental music]

10:47.792 --> 10:50.792
[sobbing]

11:10.125 --> 11:13.166
[instrumental music]

11:28.167 --> 11:29.500
Attention, please!

11:29.500 --> 11:31.041
'Okay, if we're gonna do
this party right'

11:31.041 --> 11:34.209
it needs to be memorable,
which requires a theme.

11:34.209 --> 11:38.375
So given the time constraints,
I'm thinking   toga.

11:38.375 --> 11:41.667
Alright? First thing we need
is sheets, lots of sheets.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.042
Frankie, I need you to hit up
KT. They owe us a favor.

11:44.042 --> 11:45.458
Suzanne, raid the health
center's linen closet.

11:45.458 --> 11:47.792
Tell Dr. Derrick
they're for me,
and Cheertown's too small.

11:47.792 --> 11:50.166
So we're moving
the festivities to
the workout room.

11:50.166 --> 11:52.166
Roman theme should have
corresponding drinks.

11:52.166 --> 11:54.083
- Do they make Italian beer?
- I'll find out.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.542
Thanks. Lewis, we need
a performance element.

11:56.542 --> 11:59.417
Specialty desserts. Karaoke.
Plan for designated drivers.

11:59.417 --> 12:02.542
Lots of grapes.
Rest of you get online
and spread the word.

12:02.542 --> 12:05.708
The Hellcats are
throwing an it's-the-end-
of-the-world party

12:05.708 --> 12:08.417
and we feel fine!

12:08.417 --> 12:11.167
[all cheering]

12:13.458 --> 12:16.000
She's bluffin', right?
She's gotta be.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.750
I don't think so.

12:18.875 --> 12:20.250
This doesn't make any sense.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.542
She's on a scholarship.
She'd be cuttin'
her own throat.

12:22.542 --> 12:25.250
You know, kids are
at that age, think
they're bulletproof.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.250
I can guarantee you
that she is not thinkin'

12:27.250 --> 12:29.084
realistically
about the fallout.

12:29.084 --> 12:30.250
[sighing]

12:30.250 --> 12:33.167
Then we gotta do somethin'.

12:33.167 --> 12:34.667
The fastest way
to make this go away

12:34.667 --> 12:36.792
is to convince Jake
to confess.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.291
Oh, fat chance of that.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.667
Kid's been treated
like a king ever since

12:39.667 --> 12:42.000
he set foot on campus.
He's so full of himself.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.084
He can't see the big picture.

12:43.084 --> 12:45.125
'We'd never get him onboard.'

12:46.875 --> 12:49.542
Your impulse
is a sound one, though.

12:49.542 --> 12:52.167
What are you suggesting?

12:52.167 --> 12:54.167
We doctored the evidence once.

12:54.167 --> 12:56.542
Who's to say
we can't do it again?

12:56.542 --> 12:57.917
Create a fake paper trail.

12:57.917 --> 12:59.041
Proves that Jake acted alone.

12:59.041 --> 13:01.208
The kid's expendable.
He's a piece of meat.

13:01.208 --> 13:04.792
Take a hell of a lot of bribes
to make that stick.

13:04.792 --> 13:06.000
Call it an early Christmas

13:06.000 --> 13:08.917
for the Shelby County
legal system.

13:08.917 --> 13:10.542
I won't do it, Bill,
I'm only helpin' you

13:10.542 --> 13:13.042
so Vanessa
doesn't lose her job.
I draw the line at fraud.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.625
Don't be so self-righteous.

13:14.625 --> 13:18.041
This scandal hits,
you burn like the rest of us.

13:20.792 --> 13:24.042
Okay, look,
Jake's not a bad kid.

13:24.042 --> 13:26.417
He's just self-absorbed.

13:26.417 --> 13:28.375
Let me take a run at him,
coach to QB and see

13:28.375 --> 13:31.375
if I can't get him to do
the right thing.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.667
Yeah.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.750
Alright, but...do it fast.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.583
He balks, we do it my way.

13:38.834 --> 13:41.583
Do it your way.

13:52.625 --> 13:55.708
[instrumental music]

14:14.750 --> 14:16.000
Stage one complete.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.708
We got everything we need.

14:17.708 --> 14:19.250
'Wow. This is great.'

14:20.959 --> 14:22.542
Well, I guess
we should get goin', then.

14:22.542 --> 14:24.375
Right. Time for stage two.

14:24.375 --> 14:25.917
Well done.

14:25.917 --> 14:28.167
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:31.291 --> 14:37.042
Look, uh, I wanna thank you
for orchestrating
this whole thing.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.167
Well, thank you
for trusting me.

14:39.167 --> 14:41.084
It means a lot.

14:41.084 --> 14:43.041
You're welcome.

14:43.041 --> 14:46.542
Hey, about the other day..

14:46.542 --> 14:48.042
...I'm real sorry.

14:48.042 --> 14:49.542
I had no right.

14:49.542 --> 14:52.125
Well, you weren't the only one
at fault.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.708
But still, I was
kissin' a woman

14:54.708 --> 14:58.084
who was engaged
to someone else,
and that's just plain wrong.

14:58.084 --> 15:00.125
I hope by helpin' you
and helpin' out the Hellcats

15:00.125 --> 15:03.209
I can make up for that
in some kind of way.

much like this

15:42.208 --> 15:45.166
that the last ruler
of the Roman Empire gazed upon

15:45.166 --> 15:48.542
as the barbarians approached
the gates of his beloved city.

- There's no need.
- We're not the police.

19:14.125 --> 19:16.125
We don't care about
your explanations.

19:16.125 --> 19:19.417
- Or your excuses.
- Well, then,
I guess I can go.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.583
Well, I am good enough
to ensure that
one way or another

19:35.583 --> 19:38.042
you will pay for this crime.

19:38.042 --> 19:39.583
'Now, there's two ways
we can do this.'

19:39.583 --> 19:42.500
- Option A--
- Yes, by all means, option A.

We release this video

cover-up will become public.

19:52.042 --> 19:53.875

will stand trail.'

that people were bribed

with university contracts
and football tickets.

the death penalty.

actually happens to be
a football fan?

20:14.750 --> 20:16.000

future cellmates.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.750
- Yikes.
- Oh, knock it the hell off.

will get me off

hire the best money can buy.

Sure. Yes, I do.

32:52.375 --> 32:56.417
Look at how perfectly
everything lines up.

32:56.417 --> 32:59.125
Marti moves in to Cheertown.
I start dating you.

32:59.125 --> 33:01.542
Marti's law case connects
to the pharmacy you robbed.

33:01.542 --> 33:06.166
What if God knew
a great injustice
had happened?

33:06.166 --> 33:08.167
'An innocent man
was suffering'

33:08.167 --> 33:11.208
and something
needed to be done?

33:11.208 --> 33:14.167
God's not gonna...
do something flashy

33:14.167 --> 33:17.042
like sending out a plague
of locusts, right?

33:18.209 --> 33:20.458
'He's gonna work
under the radar.'

33:26.917 --> 33:29.250
Since when are you religious,
anyway?

33:29.250 --> 33:31.166
Just because I don't talk
about it doesn't mean

33:31.166 --> 33:33.167
it's not important to me.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.209
But you can believe
whatever you want.

33:43.125 --> 33:45.208
It's your life.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.084
Would you visit me?

34:04.084 --> 34:05.167
[sighing]

34:05.167 --> 34:07.000
[instrumental music]

34:11.625 --> 34:14.667
As often as you'd like.

34:14.667 --> 34:18.083
And I will stand by
your side when you
make the announcement.

34:24.333 --> 34:26.166
That would help.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.417
You maybe wanna pray with me?

34:42.000 --> 34:43.708
Sure.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.542
We should, um..

34:47.542 --> 34:51.042
...we should do it silently.

34:51.042 --> 34:53.083
Means more that way.

34:57.166 --> 34:59.167
Okay.

35:09.750 --> 35:12.500
[music continues]

35:27.542 --> 35:28.667
[guitar music]

35:28.667 --> 35:30.250
(Jake)
Thank you all for comin'.

35:30.250 --> 35:32.708
This is difficult for me.

35:32.708 --> 35:36.333
I'm afraid
I've let all of you down

35:36.333 --> 35:40.084
my friends, teammates..

35:40.084 --> 35:42.750
...coaches and our fans.

35:44.458 --> 35:48.333
I know now that
an innocent man went
to jail for my crime.

35:50.083 --> 35:52.333
I can't allow that
to continue.

35:54.583 --> 35:57.083
And that's why
I've come forward

35:57.083 --> 35:59.209
and told the district attorney

35:59.209 --> 36:03.042
that Travis Guthrie
must go free.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.500
And I must do my time.

36:08.750 --> 36:11.125
[crowd applauding]

36:22.834 --> 36:25.291
- They love me.
- See?

36:25.291 --> 36:28.792
Told you it would play well.
Now go meet your fans.

36:32.542 --> 36:34.542
Local football hero,
Jake Harrow

36:34.542 --> 36:38.083
has just put it all on
the line in order
to do the right thing.

36:38.083 --> 36:40.083
John, in a world
where we can assume

36:40.083 --> 36:42.125
anyone forced in front
of the cameras is lying

36:42.125 --> 36:45.000
his honesty
was a breath of fresh air.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.500
There was a lot of emotions as
Harrow came clean to his fans.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.583
In fact, several had
tears in their eyes

36:49.583 --> 36:51.500
'as he took responsibility
for his actions.'

36:51.500 --> 36:54.667
(Marti)
'We're gonna make
another announcement here.'

36:54.667 --> 36:56.875
Won't have Bill Marsh
to kick around anymore.

36:56.875 --> 36:58.875
- Ooh.
- That's good.

36:58.875 --> 37:01.250
[music continues]

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
(Bill on tape)
'We doctored
the evidence once.'

37:09.000 --> 37:11.125
'Who's to say
we can't do it again?'

37:11.125 --> 37:14.209
'Create a fake paper trail,
proves that Jake acted alone.'

37:14.209 --> 37:16.834
'The kid's expendable.
He's a piece of meat.'

37:16.834 --> 37:20.458
(Red on tape)
'Take a hell of a lot
of bribes to make that stick.'

37:20.458 --> 37:22.875
- What's this?
- Your retirement speech.

37:22.875 --> 37:24.583
My students wrote that.

37:24.583 --> 37:27.708
I gave them extra credit
and everything.

37:27.708 --> 37:30.333
You give that speech
and you get to leave
with your legacy intact

37:30.333 --> 37:32.625
and Lancer football
alive and well.

37:37.959 --> 37:40.000
[scoffing]

37:41.041 --> 37:42.917
I keep my pension.

37:44.167 --> 37:45.500
No.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.333
'Down at the bottom
of the page, you announce'

37:47.333 --> 37:50.417
that you'd like to donate
your entire severance package

37:50.417 --> 37:52.250
to a cause
that's close to your heart.

37:52.250 --> 37:55.166
