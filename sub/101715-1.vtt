01:03.856 --> 01:06.775
Hey. Oh...

01:08.694 --> 01:10.153
Yeah.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.037
Come on.

02:01.914 --> 02:02.956
Yah.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.126
Yah.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.921
Hey. How you doing?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.464
- Hey.
- How's that new black doing?

02:52.548 --> 02:54.925
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Leg seems better.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.427
- Hmm.
- Still a little skittish.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.931
- Well, keep an eye on him.
- He'll be okay.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.601
Thinking I'd take him out,
check the fence line after breakfast.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.562
- It's almost ready.
- Mmm.

03:09.565 --> 03:11.400
What do we got for music?

03:14.528 --> 03:17.197
There it is. Hey?

Honey, it's too hot.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.861
Uh...

03:55.944 --> 03:57.738
I know. I hadn't checked it yet.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.364
Here. Let...

03:59.448 --> 04:01.450
Oh, that's all right.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.285
That's all right.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.870
That's all right.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.455
You rest.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.086
Ah.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.172
I see you.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.839
I see you.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.591
I see you.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.260
Hi, handsome.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.644
Oh.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.619
James.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.627
George!

04:59.091 --> 05:00.217
George!

05:19.069 --> 05:20.571
Where's George going?

05:22.281 --> 05:23.740
Where's James?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.626
James!

05:44.720 --> 05:46.096
James!

05:54.813 --> 05:56.231
Oh, no.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.945
Oh, my God.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.755
I, Lorna Blackledge...

07:46.175 --> 07:47.509
take you, Donnie...

07:48.510 --> 07:51.138
take you, Donald Weboy,

07:52.097 --> 07:54.349
to be my lawfully wedded husband.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.393
To have and to hold,

07:56.476 --> 07:59.563
from this day forward,
for better, for worse.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.774
To have and to hold,
from this day forward,

08:02.858 --> 08:04.443
for better, for worse.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.695
For richer, for poorer,

08:06.778 --> 08:08.822
in sickness and in health.

08:08.906 --> 08:11.033
For richer, for poorer,

08:11.116 --> 08:12.618
in sickness and in health.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.495
Until death do us part.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.624
Until death do us part.

08:19.583 --> 08:23.462
By the power vested in me
by the state of Montana,

08:23.545 --> 08:26.215
I now pronounce you man and wife.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.258
You may kiss the bride.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.302
Thank you, sir.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.513
Think I will.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.566
- Congratulations, Donald.
- Thank you, sir.

08:46.777 --> 08:48.111
You want some cake?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.113
Mama B.

09:30.988 --> 09:34.366
So, uh, kitchen.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.669
We've, uh... We got more stuff coming.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.796
I put some chairs on layaway.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.258
Here you go.

09:53.468 --> 09:54.761
Do you like it?

09:54.845 --> 09:56.180
- Do you like your bed?
- Yeah.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.639
- Do you like your bed?
- Yeah.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.976
I'll sew you some curtains.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.686
Okay.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.782
You'll come visit real soon.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.587
He isn't far.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.756
Just in town.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.303
He isn't here.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.477
Oh!

12:08.187 --> 12:10.230
You dropped it all, buddy.

12:10.314 --> 12:11.899
Come on, let's go.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.901
Hey. Come on, let's go.

12:45.390 --> 12:46.850
Let's go!

13:15.921 --> 13:17.965
It's not for you.

13:18.048 --> 13:20.676
<i>Lorna?</i>

13:23.178 --> 13:24.429
Lorna?

13:25.848 --> 13:26.974
Hello?

13:27.057 --> 13:29.184
Who you looking for?

13:31.770 --> 13:33.564
You're the girl's mother?

13:33.647 --> 13:35.399
No. I'm...

13:37.067 --> 13:39.027
Lorna was married to my son.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.446
The little boy is my grandson.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.031
Well, you missed 'em.

13:43.115 --> 13:44.658
Gone now.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.286
Gone?

13:47.369 --> 13:49.079
Gone to his family.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.248
Took off last night.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.084
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

13:54.168 --> 13:56.670
His family? Donnie's?

13:59.506 --> 14:01.091
They mention when they'd be back?

14:01.175 --> 14:03.343
Not no time soon be my guess.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.846
Took all they had.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.852
Headed any place in particular?

16:17.853 --> 16:19.730
Sit down, George.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.109
That my last meal?

16:26.111 --> 16:27.779
I'm going to get Jimmy.

16:28.447 --> 16:30.407
Bring him home to live with us.

16:31.867 --> 16:34.328
Well, you sure packed
for a trip into town.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.041
Sit down, George.

16:55.349 --> 16:59.269
You didn't see fit to share this with me?

17:04.983 --> 17:06.359
Sharing it now.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.617
Anyone else see it happen?

17:14.701 --> 17:17.329
You mean other than me?

17:19.039 --> 17:22.041
I'm asking if you're sure what you saw.

17:22.876 --> 17:27.422
I saw exactly what I've always felt
about Donnie Weboy.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.466
What you felt too,

17:29.550 --> 17:31.593
whether anyone'll ever
get you to admit it or not.

17:31.677 --> 17:34.137
And I saw that girl
can't protect her child.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.973
And on that account,
you expect she's, what,

17:36.056 --> 17:37.808
just gonna hand him over to you?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.977
That what you see happening?

17:44.982 --> 17:46.775
And when Lorna says no?

17:48.151 --> 17:49.736
Margaret, Jimmy's her boy.

17:49.820 --> 17:53.532
He's your grandson, George Blackledge.

18:07.462 --> 18:10.757
And your plan for finding 'em?

18:11.592 --> 18:14.803
Donnie's from somewhere
in North Dakota. I'll find 'em.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.639
You ought to know me
well enough by now.

18:17.723 --> 18:19.391
Oh, yeah.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.185
I do.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.771
I won't be coming back here
without him.

18:24.855 --> 18:26.315
Nope.

18:27.024 --> 18:30.277
And you're going with me or without me?

18:34.406 --> 18:35.991
That's your choice.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.343
You're not coming?

18:54.426 --> 18:58.096
I'm turning off the water.
Don't want to come home to busted pipes.

19:55.153 --> 19:58.115
- You don't know when you'll be back.
- I don't need reminding.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.075
I know what I've lost.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.538
Sometimes that's all life is, Margaret.

20:05.581 --> 20:07.666
The list of what we've lost.

21:30.707 --> 21:33.293
Oh, so I do get a piece.

22:18.088 --> 22:20.132
Sheriff Hayden's been out of office, oh...

22:20.799 --> 22:22.467
seven years now.

22:23.468 --> 22:25.721
Good man. Beat me to it.

22:26.763 --> 22:30.350
He helped me track down a couple of men
I was looking for back in...

22:32.019 --> 22:33.270
'52.

22:34.021 --> 22:35.147
Pettus brothers.

22:35.230 --> 22:37.774
I remember that. That was you?

22:38.942 --> 22:40.152
Well, you sure got 'em.

22:40.235 --> 22:42.029
Yeah, I had some help.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.655
Well, how can I help?

22:44.573 --> 22:46.450
We're trying to locate a Donnie Weboy.

22:48.785 --> 22:52.289
- He's got family over in North Dakota.
- I know the name.

22:52.372 --> 22:55.459
Not Donnie, but Weboy, sure.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.547
Well, he married our son's widow.

23:02.049 --> 23:03.759
Got our grandson with them.

23:03.842 --> 23:05.677
Boy's only three.

23:07.763 --> 23:10.474
We just want to know
where they are, make sure...

23:10.557 --> 23:12.267
make sure they're safe.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.774
Let me call around some.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.158
How's that pot roast?

23:32.996 --> 23:34.623
Yours is better.

23:38.126 --> 23:39.378
Hmm.

23:40.796 --> 23:42.464
You're just used to mine.

23:42.548 --> 23:46.677
<i>♪ So stop the world and let me off... ♪</i>

24:00.232 --> 24:02.776
You got a half pint behind there?
Whiskey.

24:27.259 --> 24:28.510
Happy?

24:29.386 --> 24:31.096
Happy not to hear a lecture.

24:35.851 --> 24:37.769
Gonna hide the evidence.

24:55.621 --> 24:57.080
Margaret!

25:06.048 --> 25:07.508
What the hell, Margaret?

25:09.760 --> 25:11.553
- That was before...
- What the hell?

25:12.721 --> 25:14.723
That was before I knew you were coming.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.227
You thought you'd need it?

25:18.310 --> 25:20.354
I didn't want to find out I did
and not have it.

25:22.898 --> 25:25.567
Christ, Margaret. Was this
gonna be part of your argument?

25:25.651 --> 25:28.654
- George, I would never...
- It's got bullets in it.

25:44.002 --> 25:47.631
There's a branch of the Weboy clan
over in Forsyth. Townsfolk.

25:48.757 --> 25:51.426
Trailhead Saddlery there
is a Weboy operation.

25:51.510 --> 25:53.929
Or it was started by the family.

25:54.012 --> 25:56.598
Ain't North Dakota, but I'd start there.

25:56.682 --> 25:59.268
That's what we'll do then.
Appreciate your help.

26:00.352 --> 26:02.938
We're also hoping you might recommend
a hotel in town for the night.

26:03.021 --> 26:04.398
Anyplace clean.

26:04.481 --> 26:07.985
Well, if clean's the priority,
my Sally keeps the jail here.

26:08.068 --> 26:09.736
Cells are empty.

26:09.820 --> 26:11.864
And we got fresh sheets.

26:11.947 --> 26:14.032
Not sure what feelings
you got on it.

26:14.116 --> 26:16.159
We'd be right at home.

26:16.243 --> 26:17.953
- Thank you, Sheriff Nevelson.
- My pleasure.

26:23.709 --> 26:25.252
You think they're trying to run?

26:29.840 --> 26:31.383
No, not that I know.

26:32.843 --> 26:34.761
But they did take off in a hurry.

26:35.345 --> 26:36.972
Forgot to say goodbye.

26:38.473 --> 26:40.350
I'm just looking to give her that.

26:44.104 --> 26:46.064
Let her say goodbye.

29:11.335 --> 29:13.086
Go home.

29:15.464 --> 29:17.132
Go home.

29:18.258 --> 29:19.760
Go home.

Thumping his Bible.

30:12.396 --> 30:14.481
Wasn't just Bibles he thumped.

30:28.579 --> 30:30.122
Good morning.

30:38.839 --> 30:40.382
Beautiful saddles.

30:41.133 --> 30:42.759
Wouldn't you say, George?

30:44.511 --> 30:47.764
Fella in Miles City makes 'em,
the fancy ones.

30:47.848 --> 30:48.932
Oh.

30:49.725 --> 30:51.602
Well, very impressive.

30:52.644 --> 30:55.647
But we're not shopping for saddles today.

30:57.065 --> 30:59.318
Or bridles and bits.

30:59.985 --> 31:03.322
Now, uh... would you be a Weboy?

31:04.031 --> 31:06.700
No, ma'am.
I'm a cousin to. I'm a Tucker.

31:06.783 --> 31:09.912
Oh. Well, then we're related too.

31:10.746 --> 31:12.748
Donnie Weboy's married
to our daughter-in-law.

31:12.831 --> 31:16.168
Former daughter-in-law.
Which makes him stepdaddy to our grandson.

31:20.506 --> 31:23.800
My husband and I found ourselves
in this part of the state, so I said,

31:23.884 --> 31:26.303
"Let's look in on Lorna and Donnie
while we're here."

31:26.386 --> 31:28.347
So here we are.

31:29.014 --> 31:31.225
I don't know no Donnie or a Laura.

31:31.308 --> 31:35.646
Hmm. Well, I understood
it was why they relocated here.

31:35.729 --> 31:37.856
Donnie was going to hire on
at his uncle's saddlery.

31:39.650 --> 31:42.069
- Who?
- George, didn't Lorna say?

31:42.152 --> 31:44.571
You sure you don't want Gladstone?

31:44.655 --> 31:46.240
Gladstone?

31:46.323 --> 31:47.616
North Dakota.

31:47.699 --> 31:49.868
Just the other side of the line.

31:49.952 --> 31:52.704
It's not like they got work there either,
no good work anyway,

31:52.788 --> 31:55.082
but they got a Weboy or two.

31:55.165 --> 31:58.794
Well, maybe we should give there a try.

31:58.877 --> 32:01.463
Though I don't know why
Lorna and Donnie were

32:01.547 --> 32:03.674
talking up Forsyth like they did.

32:03.757 --> 32:05.884
What was your names again?

32:06.468 --> 32:11.098
Any idea who we might ask to find Donnie,
if we went to Gladstone?

32:15.853 --> 32:20.190
You let it be known
you're looking for a Weboy,

32:20.274 --> 32:21.692
they'll find you.

32:59.438 --> 33:01.148
You're with me on this, right?

33:02.065 --> 33:04.151
Who's been doing the driving?

33:07.279 --> 33:09.865
You could say you want him back.

33:09.948 --> 33:11.450
I haven't heard that yet.

33:15.704 --> 33:17.831
We're not young, Margaret.

33:21.376 --> 33:23.086
Well, we're not old.

33:23.670 --> 33:25.714
We're not young.

33:26.423 --> 33:28.175
You saying you don't miss him?

33:28.258 --> 33:30.469
I'm saying that
he's not even in school yet.

33:30.552 --> 33:33.472
Hasn't had measles or rode a bike.

33:35.849 --> 33:37.100
He's young.

33:39.102 --> 33:40.854
And we're not.

33:43.148 --> 33:44.566
Well...

33:45.567 --> 33:48.570
you can drive me into town
then drop me off,

33:48.654 --> 33:50.906
turn around and take yourself back home.

33:52.491 --> 33:53.951
I'll do what I need to do.

33:55.536 --> 33:58.121
I'll take a bus back to Dalton with Jimmy.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.417
Yeah. Once Lorna's handed him to you?

34:03.877 --> 34:06.380
A smile on her face, happy as a clam?

34:07.714 --> 34:09.757
And if they're not down there, what?

34:15.973 --> 34:19.059
You just gonna chase them
around the country on a bus? Hmm?

34:19.141 --> 34:22.437
- What if they go where Greyhound doesn't?
- Then I'll walk.

34:23.647 --> 34:25.274
You would, too, wouldn't you?

34:30.862 --> 34:32.447
And when you finally learn

34:32.531 --> 34:34.992
that what you want to make happen
isn't gonna happen,

34:35.074 --> 34:37.077
what then, Margaret Meloy?

34:38.996 --> 34:41.706
Well, then I suppose I'll learn
what I've never been able to.

34:42.791 --> 34:45.043
Isn't that what you've always told me?

34:45.127 --> 34:46.503
Over and over.

34:46.587 --> 34:49.547
That I don't know
when it's time to call it quits.

34:54.178 --> 34:58.640
And I'll be the one gets the job of
picking up those pieces, huh?

35:10.611 --> 35:11.820
Hey.

35:16.116 --> 35:18.118
No, no, no. You just hold it.

35:18.202 --> 35:19.578
Hold it right there.

35:19.661 --> 35:21.246
I didn't take nothing, all right?
I just...

35:21.330 --> 35:22.581
You were just what?

35:23.957 --> 35:25.501
Well, I was fishing.

35:25.584 --> 35:26.752
Fishing?

35:29.630 --> 35:30.964
Fishing around this car?

35:31.048 --> 35:32.424
Well, no. No, sir.

35:32.508 --> 35:34.259
No, I'm just coming from fishing.

35:35.469 --> 35:37.554
I just seen your car,
and I was just wondering

35:37.638 --> 35:39.932
who's setting up camp out here,
that's all.

35:40.015 --> 35:43.227
- Who are you?
- Peter Dragswolf, sir.

35:44.061 --> 35:45.646
I live over there.

35:45.729 --> 35:47.397
Have my own place.

35:47.481 --> 35:51.068
I've got my own money too.
I don't need none of your goods.

35:51.151 --> 35:53.654
I'm Margaret Blackledge, Mr. Dragswolf.

35:54.738 --> 35:56.365
That's my husband George.

35:56.448 --> 35:59.034
I apologize if we're trespassing.

35:59.117 --> 36:00.953
And what's this fella's name?

36:01.036 --> 36:03.914
I can't say.
He don't belong to me.

36:04.623 --> 36:07.042
Just showed up
outside my shack one morning.

36:07.125 --> 36:10.420
I thought he was wild at first,
but he come from somewhere.

36:10.504 --> 36:11.964
I don't know.

36:13.048 --> 36:14.591
But he found me.

36:17.553 --> 36:19.346
Same as us.

36:31.525 --> 36:33.569
Maybe the horse belongs to her.

36:36.029 --> 36:37.990
Near about every horse does.

36:54.131 --> 36:56.008
I used to ride.

36:56.091 --> 36:57.801
She's being modest with you.

36:58.552 --> 37:00.470
I used to break horses.

37:02.681 --> 37:05.642
With our son. James.

37:06.810 --> 37:08.353
Then he died.

37:10.772 --> 37:14.193
And I guess I lost my appetite for it.

37:14.860 --> 37:17.613
Haven't kept animals in quite a while.

37:18.697 --> 37:21.366
It's nice to spend some time
with a sweet one like yours.

37:21.450 --> 37:24.703
What about you?
How long you been out here?

37:26.413 --> 37:28.081
Three years.

37:28.165 --> 37:30.542
All on your own? No family?

37:32.503 --> 37:34.546
Where were you before?

37:39.718 --> 37:41.512
Indian school, sir.

37:42.221 --> 37:43.847
You don't have to call me "sir."

37:44.681 --> 37:46.350
"George" will do the job.

37:49.728 --> 37:52.981
You finished that school?
How old are you?

37:59.863 --> 38:01.281
I don't bother anybody.

38:02.533 --> 38:06.036
You know, if somebody comes for the horse,
they can have him back.

38:06.119 --> 38:08.747
The skins I sell, those animals I catch.

38:08.830 --> 38:11.291
The fish are free, and I don't steal.

38:11.375 --> 38:15.254
- I mind my own business.
- Peter, come. Have some cake.

38:15.337 --> 38:17.422
Why don't you sit back
at the fire with us?

38:31.061 --> 38:34.147
You're familiar with the area, though?
Gladstone?

38:34.940 --> 38:38.235
I can tell you where the folks are buried
that ain't buried in the cemeteries.

38:39.444 --> 38:40.445
Weboys?

38:41.905 --> 38:43.740
You had any dealings with them?

38:46.869 --> 38:48.871
We're looking for our grandson.

38:48.954 --> 38:50.414
Our boy's boy.

38:52.416 --> 38:53.959
He's with a man named Donnie Weboy.

38:54.042 --> 38:56.128
- You ever heard of him?
- No.

38:56.962 --> 38:59.298
No, but if you're looking in Gladstone,

38:59.381 --> 39:00.883
look for Bill Weboy.

39:00.966 --> 39:02.301
You think he'd help us?

39:03.051 --> 39:04.720
Help, maybe.

39:07.139 --> 39:08.640
But go careful.

39:20.319 --> 39:23.030
There it is. Yellow house.

39:47.471 --> 39:49.973
- Mr. Weboy?
- Who's asking?

39:50.057 --> 39:51.725
Margaret Blackledge.

39:51.808 --> 39:54.061
And my husband George.

39:54.645 --> 39:58.982
If you're a Weboy,
we're family, after a fashion.

39:59.066 --> 40:00.692
How you figure that?

40:00.776 --> 40:03.278
Bill Weboy. A cousin, are you?

40:03.362 --> 40:07.032
Oh.
Could be, but probably not exactly.

40:08.700 --> 40:11.870
Our former daughter-in-law
married a Donnie Weboy.

40:11.954 --> 40:14.122
He's stepdad to our grandson now.

40:14.957 --> 40:16.500
That's pretty tangled up, isn't it?

40:16.583 --> 40:18.919
Family usually is.

40:21.547 --> 40:24.132
We heard they might have come
to settle here in Gladstone.

40:24.216 --> 40:27.386
We thought we'd pay a visit,
see our grandson Jimmy,

40:27.469 --> 40:28.887
since we're in the neighborhood.

40:29.888 --> 40:31.640
Since you're in the neighborhood.

40:31.723 --> 40:34.560
And since you didn't find them
up in Forsyth.

40:38.105 --> 40:40.858
- You heard we were coming, did you?
- I did. I did.

40:40.941 --> 40:42.776
A little birdie flew over here
ahead of you.

40:42.860 --> 40:45.279
- Cheep, ch-cheep, cheep...
- Are they here or not?

40:47.364 --> 40:49.366
Is he always like that,
in a big old hurry?

40:49.449 --> 40:51.368
My husband likes to get down to business.

40:51.451 --> 40:54.037
Hell of a lot of men are like that.
Can't wait to get where they're going.

40:56.248 --> 40:59.960
Women, in my experience,
would as soon take their time.

41:00.043 --> 41:01.962
Enjoy the ride, so to speak.

41:02.045 --> 41:05.757
- Mr. Weboy, I'm gonna tell you one time...
- I'm just funnin' you, George.

41:05.841 --> 41:07.885
They're here. Donnie's my nephew.

41:07.968 --> 41:11.013
They're safe and sound
over at his mom's place.

41:13.056 --> 41:15.559
Why don't we head on inside
and give the old homestead a call.

41:16.560 --> 41:18.729
Hell, you might be able
to drive over this morning,

41:18.812 --> 41:20.981
see that little precious
grandson of yours.

41:32.159 --> 41:33.452
Hey, Mabel.

41:33.535 --> 41:36.121
Can you put me through to the ranch?

41:39.583 --> 41:41.543
Blanche, it's Bill.

41:41.627 --> 41:43.545
What? What is it?

41:45.547 --> 41:47.090
Uh-huh. Got 'em right here.

41:48.425 --> 41:50.928
- What?
- You don't want this man's help.

41:52.054 --> 41:54.556
- See you soon.
- We can't do this on our own.

41:58.477 --> 41:59.937
You two have plans for supper?

42:00.020 --> 42:01.980
We surely don't.

42:02.064 --> 42:05.275
How'd you like to be guests
of the Weboy clan out at the ranch?

42:06.902 --> 42:09.238
- We don't want to be any trouble.
- No trouble at all.

42:09.321 --> 42:11.240
My sister-in-law wants to meet you.

42:12.199 --> 42:16.078
She wants to swap some old
grandpa and grandma stories.

42:16.161 --> 42:18.288
And between you and me,
she's a hell of a cook.

42:18.372 --> 42:20.791
Well, you'd have to give us directions.

42:20.874 --> 42:22.709
Nope. Not a chance.

42:22.793 --> 42:26.004
I could be the best damn direction giver
in the world, and you'd never find her.

42:26.088 --> 42:28.257
You'd be out there wandering
around Four Bridges Road

42:28.340 --> 42:30.050
and never see a one. No.

42:30.133 --> 42:34.096
You make your way back here at 4:00,
and you can follow me.

42:35.430 --> 42:37.808
Thank you. We'll come back then.

43:03.250 --> 43:04.918
About time.

43:05.002 --> 43:08.755
One of you should ride with me
and the other follow.

43:08.839 --> 43:10.799
I could tell you
where we're going and why,

43:10.883 --> 43:14.511
and that way, maybe you can
find your way back on your own.

43:22.352 --> 43:23.604
Well...

43:24.605 --> 43:26.315
Where do you think you're going?

43:26.398 --> 43:28.400
You think he wants you
in the passenger seat?

43:28.483 --> 43:30.235
No.

43:30.319 --> 43:31.862
I know he doesn't.

43:35.699 --> 43:38.410
I don't care what he wants.
I'm going. You drive.

43:38.493 --> 43:39.786
- It's fine, George.
- Margaret.

43:39.870 --> 43:41.455
Margaret. Margaret, get back in...

43:42.039 --> 43:43.373
Follow close.

44:03.519 --> 44:07.147
Pretty bird, that old jalopy
won't have trouble keeping up, will it?

44:07.231 --> 44:09.900
You're looking in the mirror often enough.
You can see where he is.

44:09.983 --> 44:12.945
I guess he just don't want you
to get too far out of his sight.

44:13.529 --> 44:15.113
Which I understand.

44:16.323 --> 44:17.658
You mind?

44:18.700 --> 44:21.620
It's your car.
You don't need my permission.

44:22.454 --> 44:26.208
You strike me as the kind of woman
men are always asking permission of.

44:26.792 --> 44:28.168
An expert, are you?

44:33.882 --> 44:36.009
I've been around more than a few women

44:36.093 --> 44:39.221
who want men to ask
before drawing a breath.

44:42.599 --> 44:43.851
We turn here.

44:43.934 --> 44:46.019
Why don't you signal
so George knows what's coming?

44:49.356 --> 44:51.859
Aye, aye, captain.

45:13.547 --> 45:15.549
How much further is it?

45:15.632 --> 45:18.135
Uh, "farther." "How much farther is it?"

45:18.218 --> 45:20.971
Or do you mean how much more of me
do you have to put up with?

45:21.054 --> 45:23.182
We just want to see Jimmy.

45:23.265 --> 45:24.516
Yeah.

45:25.767 --> 45:27.644
He's a good-looking boy there.

45:27.728 --> 45:30.314
And his mother's a fine-looking woman.

45:32.149 --> 45:36.945
You know, Donnie never asked me
for a word of advice in his life.

45:37.029 --> 45:39.156
You don't say.

45:39.239 --> 45:40.574
And if he had,

45:40.657 --> 45:42.910
I would've told him to do
exactly what he's done.

45:42.993 --> 45:45.120
"Marry yourself a widow, Donnie.

45:45.204 --> 45:46.747
You'll be getting a grateful woman."

46:40.843 --> 46:43.554
Never would've found this place
on your own, am I right?

46:44.888 --> 46:46.223
Was I right?

46:46.306 --> 46:48.016
Through here.

46:51.562 --> 46:52.688
Blanche!

46:54.231 --> 46:55.607
We're here.

46:57.276 --> 46:58.777
Blanche?

47:19.506 --> 47:21.508
I hope you like pork chops.

47:25.888 --> 47:27.806
- You're the grandma.
- I am.

47:27.890 --> 47:29.183
Margaret Blackledge.

47:29.266 --> 47:31.018
Blanche Weboy.

47:31.101 --> 47:32.686
Thanks for having us.

47:32.769 --> 47:34.146
And you're the lawman.

47:34.229 --> 47:36.773
Retired, ma'am. George Blackledge.

47:36.857 --> 47:41.570
Well, why don't we all retire
to a seat at the table, huh?

47:42.321 --> 47:43.780
Shall we?

47:48.702 --> 47:52.247
Now, who can I interest in a glass? Hmm?

47:52.331 --> 47:53.832
Oh, no, thank you.

47:54.917 --> 47:56.502
- Hmm?
- No.

47:57.586 --> 47:59.296
Ah. Well...

48:00.297 --> 48:02.132
I don't mind drinking alone.

48:11.350 --> 48:14.269
My people originally came from Illinois.

48:14.353 --> 48:19.608
Filed a homestead claim north of Gladstone
before there was a Gladstone.

48:20.317 --> 48:22.110
I'm one of eight.

48:23.946 --> 48:26.740
Lost an older sister to pneumonia.

48:26.823 --> 48:30.619
My brother Carl drowned
in a neighbor's cistern.

48:30.702 --> 48:34.873
Another fell off a truck, lived in
a wheelchair for the rest of his days.

48:34.957 --> 48:37.543
My aunt Ruth got caught in a whiteout,

48:37.626 --> 48:39.711
froze and died right where she stood,

48:39.795 --> 48:42.631
not 30 feet from that back door.

48:43.465 --> 48:45.259
Hard life.

48:45.342 --> 48:47.344
Not for everyone.

48:48.804 --> 48:54.977
My other brothers and sister
lit out, soon as they could.

48:55.060 --> 48:57.145
Never looked back.

49:00.607 --> 49:01.733
I stayed.

49:03.610 --> 49:06.488
When I first met Henry Weboy,

49:06.572 --> 49:10.367
he couldn't stop talking about
heading for Florida.

49:12.911 --> 49:16.707
I figure I had more than a little to do
with his decision to stay.

49:20.752 --> 49:26.216
Now he's buried in the same cemetery
as my folks and his.

49:27.217 --> 49:28.886
Yeah.

49:28.969 --> 49:32.931
And my boys are fourth-generation Weboys,

49:33.015 --> 49:36.393
born and living on North Dakota soil.

49:42.524 --> 49:46.403
But you didn't come here to hear me yak.

49:47.321 --> 49:49.406
You came to eat! Ha!

49:51.366 --> 49:54.328
Why don't you call the boys in
for supper, huh?

49:54.912 --> 49:56.538
I'll be back in a jiffy.

49:59.791 --> 50:01.793
I suppose you could tell a story

50:01.877 --> 50:05.255
not a hell of a lot different, am I right?

50:05.339 --> 50:07.508
About family,

50:07.591 --> 50:10.844
hardships, sacrifice, blood.

50:12.137 --> 50:14.014
Ah, meet the boys.

50:14.097 --> 50:15.265
Tall one's Elton.

50:15.349 --> 50:16.934
The other's Marvin.

50:17.601 --> 50:19.561
Say hello to our guests.

50:20.479 --> 50:22.606
That your wagon out there?

50:22.689 --> 50:26.068
We tried to get inside, take a look.

50:26.985 --> 50:29.863
Tighten a couple bolts, we could probably
get you a few more horses.

50:32.866 --> 50:35.285
Where's Jimmy? Where's the boy?

50:35.369 --> 50:37.538
Why, he's not here.

50:37.621 --> 50:39.414
- He's with his father.
- His father...

50:41.291 --> 50:43.252
We came to see our grandson.

50:43.335 --> 50:46.046
You mean you didn't come here
to eat my pork chops?

50:48.507 --> 50:51.218
If you brought us all the way out here
for the sake of a joke...

50:51.301 --> 50:54.221
Lorna said you were rough bark.

50:54.304 --> 50:56.974
And I can see already
you're no day at the races.

50:57.057 --> 50:58.767
No, ma'am.

51:00.018 --> 51:01.979
Come on, everybody. Sit down.

51:02.813 --> 51:04.815
It's not gonna get any better cold.

51:16.159 --> 51:18.161
Your grandson's with my Donnie.

51:19.496 --> 51:22.416
He took Jimmy along to pick up
the boy's mother from work.

51:22.499 --> 51:23.792
Lorna?

51:24.334 --> 51:26.170
She's working at Monkey Ward.

51:27.004 --> 51:30.215
We could've seen Jimmy and Lorna
in Gladstone?

51:30.299 --> 51:32.301
Oh, now I am feeling insulted by you.

51:32.384 --> 51:34.636
You really don't give a damn
about sharing a meal.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.763
- I just meant...
- Or maybe you're a Jew.

51:38.223 --> 51:40.267
Maybe you can't eat pork chops.

51:45.439 --> 51:47.357
Breathe easy.

51:47.441 --> 51:50.152
Anyone who knows me
knows I can't be insulted.

51:50.235 --> 51:52.529
Eat my chops or don't.

51:52.613 --> 51:56.033
Well, we'd certainly hoped to
meet Donnie's family someday.

51:56.116 --> 51:57.576
Oh, had you?

51:58.911 --> 52:01.496
Well, I'm glad to learn that.

52:02.998 --> 52:05.250
Yeah, I thought we should meet too.

52:06.793 --> 52:08.545
Have ourselves a chat.

52:10.088 --> 52:12.841
Would've been nice if it had
been at the wedding, but...

52:13.467 --> 52:16.512
maybe it was too much to ask
for his mother to be invited

52:16.595 --> 52:17.596
or his brothers.

52:17.679 --> 52:19.056
- Or poor Uncle Bill.
- Yeah.

52:19.139 --> 52:21.642
- You weren't invited?
- You recollect seeing us there?

52:22.935 --> 52:24.144
And that's our fault?

52:24.228 --> 52:28.357
You didn't stop to think to yourselves,
"He must've come from somewhere.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.317
Must have family."

52:34.238 --> 52:37.282
Frankly, we thought only that
Donnie was a grown man.

52:42.788 --> 52:44.373
Your son's dead.

52:46.959 --> 52:49.002
It's understandable you forget.

52:50.128 --> 52:52.714
We're never really done raising them.

52:52.798 --> 52:54.716
Teaching them the right way.

52:57.302 --> 52:59.221
It's why I had to bring my boy home.

53:01.181 --> 53:03.058
To keep an eye on him.

53:04.726 --> 53:06.603
Your boy's perfect now.

53:06.687 --> 53:09.273
It's not really fair
to compare him and Donnie.

53:09.356 --> 53:12.067
I wouldn't ever compare Donnie to our son.

53:13.235 --> 53:14.820
Yeah.

53:15.988 --> 53:19.783
Yeah, he said that you two don't approve.

53:19.867 --> 53:22.870
I'm surprised to hear
he gives a damn what we think.

53:25.372 --> 53:27.875
He couldn't be bothered
to tell us they were leaving.

53:27.958 --> 53:30.627
My boy doesn't have to answer to you.

53:31.461 --> 53:33.255
No, he...

53:33.964 --> 53:35.340
he does not.

53:36.008 --> 53:38.594
And we don't have to answer to you.

53:42.097 --> 53:44.224
Whoa.

53:44.308 --> 53:46.310
Whew!

53:46.894 --> 53:48.520
We better get some food in our bellies

53:48.604 --> 53:52.107
before this get-together
turns into a real blood feud.

53:52.191 --> 53:53.901
- And we got numbers on you.
- Yeah.

53:56.862 --> 54:01.033
Oh, why, here come the newlyweds now.

54:11.877 --> 54:12.878
Lorna.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.757
H-Hi, George.

54:18.926 --> 54:20.177
Hi, Jimmy.

54:24.556 --> 54:26.266
- May I?
- Oh.

54:31.396 --> 54:33.065
Oh...

54:33.732 --> 54:36.151
He's turning into quite a load.

54:37.361 --> 54:39.446
I told you, you carry him too much.

54:40.697 --> 54:42.115
How's he supposed to learn?

54:42.199 --> 54:44.451
Learn what? How to walk?
He knows how to walk.

54:44.535 --> 54:46.328
Well, hell, I'd probably
unlearn how to myself

54:46.411 --> 54:49.206
if someone carried me
everywhere I wanted to go.

54:50.123 --> 54:52.209
It's flat-out spoiling him.

54:52.292 --> 54:55.045
- He weighs nothing.
- Has he eaten?

54:55.128 --> 54:57.172
Got him a burger at Ressler's
while we were waiting.

54:57.256 --> 54:58.882
Did he eat it?

54:58.966 --> 55:00.717
Half.

55:00.801 --> 55:02.594
Do you want a pork chop, huh?

55:02.678 --> 55:04.346
- Some potatoes?
- No.

55:04.429 --> 55:05.556
Huh?

55:05.639 --> 55:08.183
- Should I cut up a little meat for you?
- No.

55:08.767 --> 55:10.727
What was that?
What are you supposed to say?

55:10.811 --> 55:12.563
No, thank you.

55:14.314 --> 55:16.233
Take him up to bed then.

55:16.900 --> 55:19.403
What? He just got here.

55:19.486 --> 55:22.030
We believe in early to bed in this house.

55:22.865 --> 55:26.827
And we believe in walking
upstairs on our own two feet.

55:31.748 --> 55:34.585
Easy now, Grandma.

55:36.461 --> 55:39.131
You know who makes the rules around here.

56:30.390 --> 56:32.100
There was mustard.

56:32.643 --> 56:34.394
There was mustard?

56:35.062 --> 56:36.647
On your hamburger?

56:38.815 --> 56:40.817
You don't like mustard, do you?

56:42.611 --> 56:43.987
Off you go!

56:44.071 --> 56:45.322
Up the stairs!

56:52.496 --> 56:54.373
Come on, Jimmy.

56:58.502 --> 57:00.045
Jimmy.

57:12.850 --> 57:13.892
That's enough.

57:15.060 --> 57:17.855
Well, now you know where to find us,
you'll have to visit more often.

57:18.897 --> 57:20.482
We thank you, but we'll...

57:21.024 --> 57:22.526
be on our way.

57:25.988 --> 57:27.781
Hey, Blackledges!

57:27.865 --> 57:29.533
Hold up there!

57:30.492 --> 57:33.537
You need me to show you the way?

57:35.873 --> 57:38.125
You know, if you left
a trail of bread crumbs,

57:38.208 --> 57:41.879
the coyotes would've got 'em by now,
or they're washed away.

57:45.257 --> 57:47.551
You know, she won't say so,

57:47.634 --> 57:51.180
but I can tell, you running off like this,
you hurt Blanche's feelings.

57:51.263 --> 57:52.890
Her feelings?

57:52.973 --> 57:55.475
We've come all this way to see Jimmy,

57:55.559 --> 57:58.270
and she gives us two minutes'
time to visit with him...

58:00.022 --> 58:02.399
Go back inside, Mr. Weboy.

58:02.482 --> 58:04.193
Why was your car locked?

58:17.456 --> 58:19.791
What are you doing out here?

58:22.085 --> 58:23.837
Damned if I know.

59:09.716 --> 59:11.426
Today's Friday, right?

59:12.928 --> 59:14.346
It is.

59:16.431 --> 59:18.892
Do you think Lorna will be
working tomorrow?

59:21.270 --> 59:23.897
It's not quite as slimming
as this would be.

59:23.981 --> 59:26.149
You know, beautiful white shirt like this.

59:26.984 --> 59:28.819
- I'll take it.
- Oh.

59:36.201 --> 59:38.245
So just these two things for you then?

59:38.328 --> 59:39.538
Yes, thank you.

59:50.048 --> 59:51.592
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

59:51.675 --> 59:53.385
7.50, ma'am.

1:00:02.269 --> 1:00:04.396
I didn't think you'd just go home.

1:00:05.272 --> 1:00:06.690
I'm like a bad penny.

1:00:08.442 --> 1:00:10.444
Who watches Jimmy while you're here?

1:00:10.527 --> 1:00:11.778
Who do you think?

1:00:11.862 --> 1:00:13.906
Donnie. His mom.

1:00:16.033 --> 1:00:19.578
Or maybe you think I just tie him
to a tree until I get home.

1:00:23.498 --> 1:00:26.585
- You're a good mother, Lorna. I know that.
- Right.

1:00:28.295 --> 1:00:31.882
I was merely wondering how things
are going for you with this new job.

1:00:31.965 --> 1:00:34.510
Well, I just started, so...

1:00:36.386 --> 1:00:38.639
We don't want to get you
in trouble, sweetheart.

1:00:38.722 --> 1:00:40.224
Can we buy you lunch?

1:00:40.807 --> 1:00:42.809
- My break isn't until noon.
- Noon?

1:00:42.893 --> 1:00:45.562
- Straight up?
- We'll meet you outside.

1:00:45.646 --> 1:00:48.607
No, I'll meet you at Ressler's.

1:00:48.690 --> 1:00:50.067
It's across the street.

1:00:59.159 --> 1:01:02.371
<i>I was going to write.
Once we got settled.</i>

1:01:03.080 --> 1:01:07.084
It was kind of a last-minute decision,
coming here.

1:01:08.502 --> 1:01:12.172
- That Donnie's decision?
- You met Blanche.

1:01:13.841 --> 1:01:16.593
Well, we found you.
That's what's important.

1:01:17.344 --> 1:01:18.637
Jimmy looks bigger.

1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:20.430
- He's growing so fast.
- There you are.

1:01:20.514 --> 1:01:22.266
He's counting to ten now.

1:01:22.891 --> 1:01:26.395
He used to just say the words, you know,
but now he understands they go in order.

1:01:27.020 --> 1:01:29.982
And I'm working with him on his alphabet.

1:01:30.065 --> 1:01:31.525
He can spell his name.

1:01:32.150 --> 1:01:34.611
Smart right from the start.

1:01:39.575 --> 1:01:41.869
He misses you, both of you.

1:01:43.954 --> 1:01:45.497
We miss him too.

1:01:46.874 --> 1:01:48.417
Both of you.

1:01:48.500 --> 1:01:50.544
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about, Lorna.

1:01:50.627 --> 1:01:53.589
And I won't... beat around the bush.

1:01:57.050 --> 1:02:00.053
I remember when James first introduced us.

1:02:00.929 --> 1:02:03.765
This wonderful girl
he told us so much about,

1:02:03.849 --> 1:02:05.976
so beautiful and funny and...

1:02:06.059 --> 1:02:07.603
No family of her own, but...

1:02:07.686 --> 1:02:10.230
Thought you weren't gonna
beat around the bush.

1:02:10.314 --> 1:02:13.442
I have to be back at the store by 1:00.
Just get to it.

1:02:13.525 --> 1:02:16.695
All right. Well, here it is.

1:02:19.531 --> 1:02:21.116
Let Jimmy come back with us.

1:02:22.868 --> 1:02:25.579
Not just to visit. I mean for good.

1:02:28.916 --> 1:02:30.375
You...

1:02:32.711 --> 1:02:35.047
You want me to give Jimmy to you?

1:02:36.006 --> 1:02:37.799
- Want me to give up my son?
- You know he'd have

1:02:37.883 --> 1:02:39.760
a good home, one he knows,
one he remembers...

1:02:39.843 --> 1:02:41.178
Stop.

1:02:41.261 --> 1:02:43.263
You know the schools he'd go to,
the teachers he'd have...

1:02:43.347 --> 1:02:45.641
No, God, stop! I can't hear this!

1:02:51.897 --> 1:02:56.193
I saw Donnie hit Jimmy.

1:02:58.737 --> 1:03:00.531
On the street.

1:03:02.699 --> 1:03:04.535
I saw him hit you.

1:03:04.618 --> 1:03:07.079
And it didn't look like a first time.

1:03:09.790 --> 1:03:12.501
A little or a lot, no amount's good.

1:03:13.752 --> 1:03:15.420
- That's why we're here...
- You came to take him.

1:03:15.504 --> 1:03:17.005
Lorna.

1:03:17.089 --> 1:03:18.757
We came to help.

1:03:19.424 --> 1:03:21.301
Whatever the situation is.

1:03:22.469 --> 1:03:23.887
Jimmy can't stay there.

1:03:25.222 --> 1:03:26.890
Can't stay here.

1:03:28.725 --> 1:03:32.020
- He needs his mother.
- Then come with us.

1:03:32.104 --> 1:03:34.273
You and Jimmy.
We'll take care of you.

1:03:34.356 --> 1:03:36.191
Live with us, like before.

1:03:36.275 --> 1:03:37.401
Tuna.

1:03:39.361 --> 1:03:41.697
- You come and stay with us.
- Pardon me.

1:03:43.490 --> 1:03:45.075
There you go.

1:03:50.455 --> 1:03:51.874
He'd kill me.

1:03:53.125 --> 1:03:54.459
Him and his mother.

1:03:55.210 --> 1:03:58.672
She couldn't care less if I fell off
the face of the earth, really,

1:03:58.755 --> 1:04:00.883
but she'd never let me go.

1:04:00.966 --> 1:04:02.634
Or Jimmy.

1:04:05.095 --> 1:04:07.472
Donnie got away from her once.

1:04:07.556 --> 1:04:10.142
She's never going to
let that happen again.

1:04:12.394 --> 1:04:15.647
I don't want Jimmy to grow up like them.

1:04:17.399 --> 1:04:19.359
Don't want him to be like them.

1:04:21.945 --> 1:04:24.323
Then you know what's right.

1:04:26.825 --> 1:04:28.035
Honey.

1:04:30.454 --> 1:04:32.497
You want us to drive you out there?

1:04:32.581 --> 1:04:34.041
We can do that.

1:04:34.124 --> 1:04:35.542
Right now.

1:04:35.626 --> 1:04:37.586
Right, George?

1:04:37.669 --> 1:04:39.004
The three of us, we can get Jimmy,

1:04:39.087 --> 1:04:41.423
- pack you up, take you back...
- No. No.

1:04:46.011 --> 1:04:47.095
I'll meet you.

1:04:50.349 --> 1:04:52.184
Everybody's usually asleep by midnight.

1:04:53.810 --> 1:04:57.147
I'll have to wait to be sure.

1:04:58.982 --> 1:05:00.359
We should come get you, sweetheart.

1:05:00.442 --> 1:05:03.028
No. This is the way.

1:05:03.111 --> 1:05:05.489
The safest way, trust me.

1:05:05.572 --> 1:05:09.368
That's... That's what everyone
wants most, isn't it?

1:05:10.285 --> 1:05:13.455
For you and Jimmy to be safe. Hmm?

1:05:14.873 --> 1:05:15.916
And happy.

1:05:18.001 --> 1:05:19.670
We're out at the Moon Wink.

1:05:21.004 --> 1:05:23.257
- 'Kay.
- Cabin seven at the Moon Wink Motor...

1:05:23.340 --> 1:05:25.259
I heard you. I know where it is.

1:05:26.593 --> 1:05:28.595
I should be there by 2:00.

1:05:29.888 --> 1:05:32.641
But we have to leave
right when I get there.

1:05:32.724 --> 1:05:33.892
No waiting.

1:05:38.021 --> 1:05:39.356
Okay.

1:05:39.439 --> 1:05:41.233
Lorna, wait.

1:05:42.943 --> 1:05:44.403
Wait. Lorna.

1:05:46.530 --> 1:05:47.823
I...

1:05:49.616 --> 1:05:51.994
I know we haven't always
seen eye to eye, but...

1:05:52.077 --> 1:05:54.830
I don't think we've ever seen eye to eye.

1:05:56.748 --> 1:05:58.792
Well... we will.

1:05:59.793 --> 1:06:01.879
You're just saying that
to make sure that I go with you.

1:06:05.174 --> 1:06:06.592
Jimmy needs his mother.

1:06:09.928 --> 1:06:11.805
You could've used one too.

1:06:15.976 --> 1:06:17.603
I could've been that to you.

1:06:18.645 --> 1:06:20.355
I should've been.

1:06:21.690 --> 1:06:23.233
But I wasn't.

1:06:25.068 --> 1:06:26.653
It's okay.

1:06:28.405 --> 1:06:29.698
I'm sorry, Lorna.

1:06:33.493 --> 1:06:36.371
I should've been... much more to you.

1:08:14.845 --> 1:08:17.014
Don't start what you can't finish.

1:08:47.377 --> 1:08:50.796
Can you...
answer something for me?

1:08:51.965 --> 1:08:53.008
Okay.

1:08:54.468 --> 1:08:57.220
That horse of yours, Strawberry.

1:08:57.304 --> 1:08:58.971
Strawberry?

1:08:59.515 --> 1:09:01.892
I loved that horse.

1:09:02.643 --> 1:09:04.144
What brought that up?

1:09:05.312 --> 1:09:06.939
Seeing you ride again.

1:09:07.022 --> 1:09:08.106
Hmm.

1:09:11.318 --> 1:09:15.781
Something I always wondered about,
when we had to put her down.

1:09:18.033 --> 1:09:20.035
You whispered to her. Do you remember?

1:09:20.118 --> 1:09:21.953
Yeah.

1:09:22.037 --> 1:09:25.249
Like you were telling secrets.

1:09:28.836 --> 1:09:30.712
What was it you told her?

1:09:37.511 --> 1:09:39.054
I reminded her of things.

1:09:40.889 --> 1:09:45.102
How she liked to gallop through
the first snow every year.

1:09:45.185 --> 1:09:47.395
About the time we raced Ernie Dahlberg

1:09:47.479 --> 1:09:50.189
and his big chocolate mare
and left them choking in our dust.

1:09:52.149 --> 1:09:54.653
I reminded her of this one time.

1:09:54.736 --> 1:09:57.072
I was in high school...
it was some October,

1:09:57.155 --> 1:09:59.116
and we were heading home.

1:09:59.199 --> 1:10:02.578
And the full moon was just
coming up over Dollar Butte.

1:10:03.412 --> 1:10:04.872
And she stopped.

1:10:04.955 --> 1:10:07.416
Stopped and stared.

1:10:07.499 --> 1:10:09.751
Like she cared about
the moonrise as much as me.

1:10:13.046 --> 1:10:16.675
And when we put James on her back
for the very first time...

1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:20.762
she stood so still.

1:10:22.681 --> 1:10:25.100
Like she knew she had to take care of him.

1:10:34.902 --> 1:10:37.988
I wanted to send her on her way
with happy memories.

1:10:43.952 --> 1:10:45.579
I'm sorry.

1:10:46.788 --> 1:10:49.249
Sorry? Why?

1:10:49.333 --> 1:10:51.251
I made you sad. That's...

1:10:52.753 --> 1:10:54.338
That's not what I wanted.

1:10:56.465 --> 1:10:59.092
You didn't make me sad, George.

1:11:07.100 --> 1:11:09.311
What I wanted is to tell you...

1:11:11.855 --> 1:11:13.941
tell you what sticks with me.

1:11:17.486 --> 1:11:18.987
Strawberry and you.

1:11:21.698 --> 1:11:24.451
This woman I married but can't figure.

1:11:26.662 --> 1:11:29.831
Who doesn't believe
there's any world but this one,

1:11:29.915 --> 1:11:33.001
but still believes
a horse has got a soul somehow.

1:11:37.923 --> 1:11:39.800
That's the gal for me.

1:12:08.495 --> 1:12:10.455
She did seem quick to come around.

1:12:10.539 --> 1:12:11.790
Please.

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:14.501
Don't say anything.

1:13:42.464 --> 1:13:43.966
Get out.

1:13:46.134 --> 1:13:47.719
No, you get the hell out now.

1:13:49.137 --> 1:13:50.305
George!

1:13:53.392 --> 1:13:54.643
He let us in.

1:13:56.061 --> 1:13:58.689
See, you think you can gang up on Lorna.

1:13:59.439 --> 1:14:02.734
But when it's done to you,
it's a different story.

1:14:02.818 --> 1:14:03.986
What are you talking about?

1:14:04.069 --> 1:14:05.612
Oh, is that what you're gonna do?

1:14:05.696 --> 1:14:08.907
Pretend like you two
didn't jump Lorna at work?

1:14:08.991 --> 1:14:10.033
Shame on you.

1:14:10.117 --> 1:14:11.410
Shame on both of you,

1:14:11.493 --> 1:14:14.246
badgering and bullying her
to give up her boy.

1:14:14.329 --> 1:14:17.666
You're lucky Lorna doesn't have
a little mama grizzly in her.

1:14:17.749 --> 1:14:19.585
Come between that kind of mama
and her baby,

1:14:19.668 --> 1:14:23.005
you're fixin' to get your hand bit,
or worse than.

1:14:23.839 --> 1:14:26.842
Somebody tried to come between
me and one of my boys...

1:14:27.759 --> 1:14:31.180
- tried to talk me out of my child...
- That's not what happened.

1:14:31.263 --> 1:14:33.557
It's no wonder Lorna don't
want to go with you.

1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:36.268
Big bull-hen.

1:14:36.351 --> 1:14:38.979
Thinking you know
what's best for everybody.

1:14:39.062 --> 1:14:40.606
Pecking you to death, no doubt.

1:14:40.689 --> 1:14:42.691
I never said she shouldn't marry Donnie.

1:14:42.774 --> 1:14:44.026
I never said you did.

1:14:50.657 --> 1:14:52.075
He hit the boy.

1:14:54.453 --> 1:14:57.664
I saw you, across the street
from the grocery.

1:14:57.748 --> 1:14:59.625
Is that what all this fuss is about?

1:15:00.250 --> 1:15:02.461
Grandma, are you gonna tell me
you didn't paddle your own, huh?

1:15:02.544 --> 1:15:04.046
Not ever?

1:15:04.755 --> 1:15:06.423
He hit Lorna too.

1:15:12.221 --> 1:15:13.847
Come here.

1:15:21.897 --> 1:15:23.106
You hit your wife?

1:15:25.651 --> 1:15:26.985
I saw him.

1:15:28.070 --> 1:15:30.697
- How'd he do it?
- With his hand.

1:15:30.781 --> 1:15:32.074
With...

1:15:33.242 --> 1:15:36.203
Alberta Einstein.
Yeah, I know with his hand.

1:15:36.286 --> 1:15:37.746
I'm asking how.

1:15:38.789 --> 1:15:40.040
Like...

1:15:41.667 --> 1:15:42.876
Hmm?

1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:44.586
Was it like that?

1:15:48.048 --> 1:15:50.050
Donnie, how'd you do it? How was it?

1:15:52.803 --> 1:15:53.846
It was harder.

1:15:53.929 --> 1:15:55.514
Harder?

1:15:58.976 --> 1:16:00.185
Like...

1:16:01.645 --> 1:16:03.105
Goddamn it.

1:16:06.024 --> 1:16:07.609
Like that?

1:16:08.902 --> 1:16:10.737
Like that but harder.

1:16:13.073 --> 1:16:14.074
Donnie...

1:16:15.701 --> 1:16:18.370
think you're gonna have to
show us how you done it.

1:16:37.973 --> 1:16:39.766
Son of...

1:16:41.143 --> 1:16:42.895
No!

1:16:42.978 --> 1:16:44.396
George!

1:16:46.356 --> 1:16:48.734
Oh, no, he's all right, Margaret.
He's fine.

1:16:50.319 --> 1:16:51.737
Yeah?

1:16:52.487 --> 1:16:55.991
Maybe you want to try talking
this over again now, huh?

1:16:56.074 --> 1:16:58.368
Like reasonable folks.

1:16:58.452 --> 1:17:00.871
Or maybe you'd prefer getting some sleep,

1:17:00.954 --> 1:17:04.291
so you can get an early start
back home tomorrow.

1:17:04.374 --> 1:17:07.294
Or maybe...
maybe you'd like to send him home

1:17:07.377 --> 1:17:09.755
while you stay on here for a spell.

1:17:09.838 --> 1:17:12.716
I could take you back when you're ready.

1:17:13.926 --> 1:17:18.972
Of course, by then,
you might decide you want to stay.

1:17:22.935 --> 1:17:24.394
It's okay.

1:17:24.478 --> 1:17:27.648
It's okay. Easy, girl. Easy, girl.

1:17:32.319 --> 1:17:33.570
You stop right there.

1:17:37.783 --> 1:17:39.201
You...

1:17:40.035 --> 1:17:41.578
you stay away from us.

1:17:47.876 --> 1:17:49.628
- Get him! Get the gun!
- Get him! Get him!

1:17:49.711 --> 1:17:50.754
Get him up!

1:17:50.838 --> 1:17:53.048
No.

1:18:00.931 --> 1:18:01.974
Please.

1:18:20.409 --> 1:18:21.952
Donnie.

1:18:25.163 --> 1:18:27.499
What do you want me to do?

1:18:28.417 --> 1:18:30.460
You make sure he can't
pull a gun on us again.

1:18:31.211 --> 1:18:33.046
No!

1:18:35.090 --> 1:18:37.092
- Right here.
- No!

1:18:38.218 --> 1:18:39.887
No.

1:18:41.305 --> 1:18:43.265
- No.
- No!

1:18:46.476 --> 1:18:47.853
No!

1:18:49.146 --> 1:18:50.731
Go on, Donnie.

1:18:50.814 --> 1:18:52.191
Come on.

1:18:58.780 --> 1:19:02.451
- Stop.
- I'm teaching you to teach him, see?

1:19:02.534 --> 1:19:04.328
Donnie.

1:19:05.746 --> 1:19:07.581
- Donnie, don't! Donnie. Donnie.
- Donnie.

1:19:08.373 --> 1:19:10.042
You don't have to do this.

1:19:11.752 --> 1:19:13.420
Please, Donnie! Please, Donnie.
Please, Donnie.

1:19:13.504 --> 1:19:15.088
- Donnie, don't do it. Don't do it.
- Do it, boy.

1:19:15.172 --> 1:19:17.216
- Do it, boy.
- Donnie! Don't do it!

1:19:17.799 --> 1:19:19.551
- Donnie.
- Don't do it!

1:19:25.474 --> 1:19:27.100
Oh, my God!

1:19:27.809 --> 1:19:29.937
George. Oh, my God.

1:19:30.020 --> 1:19:32.314
George. George.

1:19:32.397 --> 1:19:35.108
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:19:35.192 --> 1:19:36.985
Well, he won't be shooting for a while.

1:19:51.041 --> 1:19:53.418
Maybe you understand my family now.

1:19:56.255 --> 1:19:58.090
Safe driving, you two.

1:20:02.052 --> 1:20:04.221
George.

1:20:04.304 --> 1:20:06.223
George, George, George.

1:20:06.306 --> 1:20:07.808
Oh, my God.

1:20:07.891 --> 1:20:10.519
What have I done to you? Oh, my God.

1:20:20.237 --> 1:20:22.155
He's gonna need morphine.

1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:24.575
It's okay.

1:20:25.617 --> 1:20:29.830
- This was an ax, you said?
- Was a... Was a hatchet.

1:20:29.913 --> 1:20:31.498
Police are on their way.

1:20:32.916 --> 1:20:35.878
Look, I can put you under
or I can numb it up and you stay...

1:20:35.961 --> 1:20:37.337
Awake, right.

1:20:37.421 --> 1:20:38.797
- Awake.
- I'll stay awake.

1:20:38.881 --> 1:20:40.632
Yeah, you're okay.

1:20:40.716 --> 1:20:41.925
Awake.

1:20:42.009 --> 1:20:43.969
Ma'am, you're welcome
to wait outside.

1:20:45.012 --> 1:20:46.555
What?

1:21:28.931 --> 1:21:30.307
Well...

1:21:30.974 --> 1:21:33.936
Now, I already been over to the Weboys',
had a chance to hear their side.

1:21:34.019 --> 1:21:35.729
Their side?

1:21:35.812 --> 1:21:37.022
Side of what?

1:21:37.898 --> 1:21:41.151
Their account is that it's Mr. Blackledge
here who pulled a gun.

1:21:41.235 --> 1:21:42.986
In self-defense.

1:21:43.070 --> 1:21:45.322
That your service revolver
Blanche showed me?

1:21:46.865 --> 1:21:48.534
I'm sure it is.

1:21:48.617 --> 1:21:51.828
- You wore the badge once.
- He wore it over 30 years.

1:21:51.912 --> 1:21:53.288
Well...

1:21:54.289 --> 1:21:56.250
then you know how the law works.

1:21:56.834 --> 1:21:58.710
I have...

1:21:58.794 --> 1:22:01.171
I have a fair idea
I know how it works here.

1:22:03.674 --> 1:22:05.634
Blanche explained
that things got a tad rough

1:22:05.717 --> 1:22:07.803
persuading you to set your weapon down.

1:22:07.886 --> 1:22:09.179
They chopped his hand off.

1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:11.807
Yeah, well, the way they tell it, you two,

1:22:11.890 --> 1:22:15.185
you came here looking to take
a child away from his mother.

1:22:15.269 --> 1:22:17.396
First with talk... well, threats...

1:22:17.479 --> 1:22:19.439
and then a gun.

1:22:19.523 --> 1:22:21.859
Lorna, the boy's mother, did you see her?

1:22:21.942 --> 1:22:23.235
Oh, sure, she was there.

1:22:23.318 --> 1:22:25.612
Did you speak with her?
She's terrified of them.

1:22:25.696 --> 1:22:28.198
She was married to your son, right?

1:22:29.116 --> 1:22:30.659
Yes.

1:22:30.742 --> 1:22:31.827
Hmm.

1:22:32.661 --> 1:22:34.413
And he died, right? He's dead.

1:22:35.247 --> 1:22:36.915
How exactly did that happen?

1:22:39.459 --> 1:22:40.836
Why don't you tell us?

1:22:42.671 --> 1:22:45.841
Well, um... an accident, she said.

1:22:46.758 --> 1:22:50.679
You know, was thrown from his horse,
broke his neck, snapped in two.

1:22:53.473 --> 1:22:55.350
An accident.

1:22:55.934 --> 1:22:58.478
And it's an accident.

1:23:01.440 --> 1:23:03.483
You know, and Blanche...

1:23:03.567 --> 1:23:07.654
she expressed real concern about
how accidents follow your family.

1:23:10.199 --> 1:23:12.951
She fears for that little one
she's looking after now.

1:23:14.369 --> 1:23:17.748
How the longer you two stick around,
the chances of something happening to him,

1:23:17.831 --> 1:23:20.542
well, those chances,
they just keep creeping up.

1:23:21.877 --> 1:23:25.672
I don't even want to contemplate
what a tragedy that would be.

1:23:26.882 --> 1:23:30.844
There's nothing smaller in this world
than a kid's casket.

1:23:34.473 --> 1:23:35.724
Get out.

1:23:36.558 --> 1:23:38.435
Well, the consensus over there
is that you two won't be

1:23:38.519 --> 1:23:39.811
causing any more trouble around here.

1:23:39.895 --> 1:23:43.398
And because you're family, by a way,
the Weboys won't be pressing any charges.

1:23:43.482 --> 1:23:46.068
So you're free to go.

1:23:47.152 --> 1:23:48.946
But, you know,
if I were giving out advice...

1:23:49.029 --> 1:23:50.113
You can save that.

1:23:50.197 --> 1:23:52.658
Well, see, I'm thinking of
your grandson here.

1:23:54.117 --> 1:23:56.119
He's a Weboy now.

1:23:59.748 --> 1:24:02.251
It's best you put Gladstone behind you.

1:24:03.669 --> 1:24:05.671
Just as quick as you can.

1:24:19.059 --> 1:24:21.061
Hey, pull over.

1:24:22.187 --> 1:24:25.399
- What's wrong?
- Goddamn it.

1:24:25.482 --> 1:24:26.525
Pull over.

1:24:45.669 --> 1:24:46.962
George.

1:24:47.045 --> 1:24:49.214
Are you all right? Talk to me.

1:24:50.340 --> 1:24:52.467
I'm fine.

1:24:57.347 --> 1:24:59.183
I needed to pull over is all.

1:26:01.036 --> 1:26:03.080
Where in the hell are we?

1:26:42.661 --> 1:26:43.996
So what will you do?

1:26:45.372 --> 1:26:46.748
I don't know.

1:26:48.166 --> 1:26:50.169
Well, I heard what them Weboys
done to you.

1:26:52.212 --> 1:26:54.381
Except I didn't know it was you.

1:26:55.799 --> 1:26:56.884
What did you hear?

1:26:56.967 --> 1:26:59.678
Well, that they chopped
somebody's arm off.

1:27:00.554 --> 1:27:02.347
Who told you that?

1:27:03.223 --> 1:27:05.475
My uncle. In Gladstone.

1:27:06.643 --> 1:27:08.770
So you have family in town then.

1:27:08.854 --> 1:27:13.233
An uncle and an aunt.
They sell skins for me.

1:27:13.317 --> 1:27:15.068
And other stuff.

1:27:15.152 --> 1:27:17.571
Why do you live
all the way out here then?

1:27:17.654 --> 1:27:19.448
All alone.

1:27:19.531 --> 1:27:21.742
It's not where you're from.

1:27:25.078 --> 1:27:27.664
'Cause I ran away from
that school in Bismarck.

1:27:40.886 --> 1:27:44.890
The government agents
came into the house when I was eight.

1:27:47.351 --> 1:27:50.437
They took me and put me in their truck.

1:27:53.774 --> 1:27:57.778
You know, I thought I did something wrong
and that my mother didn't want me anymore.

1:28:01.823 --> 1:28:03.909
But then I could see she was crying.

1:28:06.537 --> 1:28:07.996
All the mothers were.

1:28:09.456 --> 1:28:11.083
You were eight?

1:28:13.460 --> 1:28:14.920
They cut my hair off.

1:28:16.505 --> 1:28:18.382
And washed me in kerosene.

1:28:19.132 --> 1:28:20.634
And beat me.

1:28:22.052 --> 1:28:24.137
To kill the Indian inside.

1:28:27.558 --> 1:28:29.017
I guess they did.

1:28:30.811 --> 1:28:32.563
So when I came home,

1:28:32.646 --> 1:28:35.691
I couldn't understand
my grandmother's words anymore.

1:28:36.733 --> 1:28:38.235
"I'm Peter now."

1:28:39.278 --> 1:28:40.863
Tried to tell her.

1:28:43.448 --> 1:28:45.200
She couldn't understand me, either.

1:28:50.914 --> 1:28:52.875
If I don't belong anyplace...

1:28:56.795 --> 1:28:58.338
here is fine.

1:29:02.134 --> 1:29:03.844
You picked a good spot.

1:29:06.555 --> 1:29:08.432
But it's not good to be alone.

1:29:09.224 --> 1:29:10.976
I'm not alone.

1:29:16.356 --> 1:29:17.858
I'm talking to you.

1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:36.376
I have an idea.

1:29:38.337 --> 1:29:40.005
Yeah.

1:29:40.088 --> 1:29:41.632
That's not a first.

1:29:41.715 --> 1:29:43.967
Let me finish
before you make fun of me.

1:29:44.051 --> 1:29:46.803
And if you don't know what to say,
don't say anything.

1:29:50.140 --> 1:29:52.392
- Let's hear it.
- What if we stayed?

1:29:53.477 --> 1:29:55.103
Here.

1:29:55.187 --> 1:29:58.148
I'm sure Peter would be
glad of the company.

1:29:58.232 --> 1:29:59.816
We could build onto this place.

1:29:59.900 --> 1:30:03.654
We could put another room on the kitchen.
Or we could build a place of our own.

1:30:05.197 --> 1:30:08.659
You hold the boards while
I hammer in the nails. That it?

1:30:08.742 --> 1:30:11.203
You said you'd let me finish.

1:30:12.496 --> 1:30:14.790
You're finished now.
You just don't know it.

1:30:15.707 --> 1:30:18.919
You really want us to live out here
in the middle of nowhere with a...

1:30:19.753 --> 1:30:21.922
Indian boy and a lost horse?

1:30:22.923 --> 1:30:26.343
Just so you can, what,
drive into town every now and again,

1:30:26.426 --> 1:30:28.262
try and catch a peek at Jimmy?

1:30:30.430 --> 1:30:35.394
You'll follow him to school
and hope time untwists a sour mind

1:30:35.477 --> 1:30:39.314
and Blanche Weboy lets you hold him again
for longer than 30 seconds' time?

1:30:41.024 --> 1:30:43.026
When they come again...

1:30:43.944 --> 1:30:46.154
hack off another couple pieces...

1:30:46.238 --> 1:30:50.033
or they start taking pieces of you,
if there's anything left

1:30:50.117 --> 1:30:51.952
once you're done tearing yourself apart?

1:30:52.035 --> 1:30:53.453
What then?

1:30:54.454 --> 1:30:57.499
And when they hurt Jimmy?
And they will, just for spite.

1:30:59.042 --> 1:31:00.878
How you gonna feel then?

1:31:04.464 --> 1:31:06.008
First time I held him,

1:31:06.967 --> 1:31:10.470
he arranged himself
just right in my arms

1:31:10.554 --> 1:31:12.598
and snug to me.

1:31:12.681 --> 1:31:14.349
And light as can be, like feathers...

1:31:14.433 --> 1:31:16.518
Jesus Christ, Margaret!

1:31:18.562 --> 1:31:21.106
When are you gonna stop
torturing yourself?

1:31:30.657 --> 1:31:31.950
I tried.

1:31:33.744 --> 1:31:35.120
I'm sorry.

1:31:38.707 --> 1:31:40.167
I tried, George.

1:31:40.250 --> 1:31:42.252
I know.

1:31:46.924 --> 1:31:49.426
But I couldn't save him.

1:31:49.510 --> 1:31:51.303
God help me.

1:31:56.141 --> 1:31:57.184
Shh.

1:32:00.896 --> 1:32:02.189
Hey. Shh.

1:32:03.273 --> 1:32:05.609
We lost them both.

1:32:33.136 --> 1:32:36.265
George! George!

1:32:43.689 --> 1:32:47.484
Even as fast as you are,
I don't think you're gonna catch him.

1:32:47.568 --> 1:32:50.153
If he's going where I think,
he'll have to take the road.

1:32:50.237 --> 1:32:52.948
- You're gonna show me a quicker way.
- I'm gonna...

1:32:53.991 --> 1:32:56.577
- I'm not going.
- You are.

1:36:15.984 --> 1:36:18.403
Settle.

1:36:19.488 --> 1:36:21.031
Be still.

1:36:22.115 --> 1:36:24.326
Wake her up. Wake her.

1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:27.496
- Lorna.
- What?

1:36:30.123 --> 1:36:32.835
You want to go back to Dalton?
You and Jimmy?

1:36:33.877 --> 1:36:36.129
You have to decide.
Go or stay.

1:36:37.130 --> 1:36:39.800
- Lorna, ple...
- Not you.

1:36:40.717 --> 1:36:43.053
You don't get to say a goddamn word.

1:36:44.429 --> 1:36:46.640
This is up to her.

1:36:47.599 --> 1:36:49.434
You know what life will be.

1:36:49.518 --> 1:36:50.936
Here or there, you know.

1:36:51.854 --> 1:36:53.647
This isn't something you need to think on.

1:36:53.730 --> 1:36:55.190
I'll go.

1:36:58.235 --> 1:37:01.196
You know the car.
It's at the bottom of the drive.

1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:02.447
The keys are in it.

1:37:03.073 --> 1:37:05.659
Drive straight to the sheriff's office
in Bentrock. Ask for Nevelson.

1:37:05.742 --> 1:37:07.703
- Bentrock.
- Sheriff Nevelson.

1:37:08.704 --> 1:37:11.039
- He'll sort this out.
- Jimmy's things.

1:37:11.123 --> 1:37:13.333
- I need to get...
- No. Out now.

1:37:25.095 --> 1:37:26.555
But what about you?

1:37:28.348 --> 1:37:29.683
Just go.

1:37:30.434 --> 1:37:31.560
- No...
- Just go.

1:37:31.643 --> 1:37:33.812
Quiet as you can. Take the front door.

1:37:34.813 --> 1:37:36.648
Then you run like hell.

1:37:50.412 --> 1:37:51.413
Grandpa.

1:38:09.806 --> 1:38:12.392
Something's burning.
Hey, something's burning! Come on!

1:38:13.852 --> 1:38:15.812
- You leave that stove on?
- Mm-mmm.

1:38:28.367 --> 1:38:29.701
What the hell is going on?

1:38:29.785 --> 1:38:32.746
Bill, the... the house is on fire.

1:38:32.829 --> 1:38:35.582
Uh... w-we smelled smoke.

1:38:37.793 --> 1:38:40.128
- Hold on. Hold on.
- No!

1:38:48.428 --> 1:38:49.680
Help!

1:38:50.305 --> 1:38:52.224
- No. No.
- Hold on. Hold on.

1:38:52.307 --> 1:38:54.476
- No! Get your hands off of him!
- Don't! Don't!

1:39:19.084 --> 1:39:20.085
Jimmy.

1:39:23.380 --> 1:39:25.299
Bill, what's going...

1:39:38.103 --> 1:39:39.438
Bill.

1:39:39.521 --> 1:39:42.149
- Bill, out of the way. I got him.
- God's sake, Blanche, don't shoot!

1:39:53.702 --> 1:39:54.786
Lorna!

1:40:02.794 --> 1:40:04.880
Give the boy to me, old man!

1:40:09.885 --> 1:40:12.137
No one gets hurt.

1:40:25.984 --> 1:40:27.402
No.

1:40:31.031 --> 1:40:32.032
Boys!

1:40:35.202 --> 1:40:36.620
House is on fire!

1:40:36.703 --> 1:40:38.830
Get Lorna! She's got the boy!

1:40:41.542 --> 1:40:43.168
Mama?

1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:46.004
Marvin!

1:40:52.970 --> 1:40:54.304
Oh, my God.

1:40:59.643 --> 1:41:01.270
Lorna!

1:41:06.775 --> 1:41:08.777
Lorna. Jimmy.

1:41:09.444 --> 1:41:10.445
Are you all right?

1:41:12.656 --> 1:41:15.075
Baby. Where's George?

1:41:15.158 --> 1:41:17.286
He told me to run, to take the car.

1:41:18.287 --> 1:41:19.454
- Stay with her.
- No.

1:41:19.538 --> 1:41:20.914
No, stay, stay.

1:41:22.124 --> 1:41:23.876
Stay with them, Peter!

1:42:02.664 --> 1:42:03.999
George.

1:42:16.345 --> 1:42:18.388
Jimmy. Where's Jimmy?

1:42:18.472 --> 1:42:20.724
He's safe, George. With Lorna.

1:42:20.807 --> 1:42:22.309
And Peter. They're waiting for us.

1:42:24.770 --> 1:42:26.063
Blanche?

1:42:26.146 --> 1:42:27.606
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

1:42:27.689 --> 1:42:29.233
I don't know. We have to go.

1:42:34.321 --> 1:42:36.782
Just go. Go. Get out.

1:42:38.158 --> 1:42:39.618
Not without you.

1:42:39.701 --> 1:42:41.245
Come on.

1:42:41.328 --> 1:42:44.414
Come on. You can lean on me.

1:42:50.671 --> 1:42:51.713
Margaret?

1:42:52.464 --> 1:42:53.841
George!

1:42:53.924 --> 1:42:55.175
Peter.

1:42:57.719 --> 1:42:59.638
- Margaret.
- George!

1:43:08.063 --> 1:43:09.398
Why?

1:43:10.107 --> 1:43:11.608
Why?

1:43:12.818 --> 1:43:14.570
You, you go to hell!

1:43:23.453 --> 1:43:25.038
Look at me. Look at me.

1:43:25.122 --> 1:43:28.750
Please look at me. I'm right here.

1:43:28.834 --> 1:43:30.294
George.

1:43:39.511 --> 1:43:42.806
- George. George!
- Margaret. We have to go.

1:43:42.890 --> 1:43:44.474
Come on.

1:43:44.558 --> 1:43:46.518
- We have to go now!
- No!

1:43:53.942 --> 1:43:56.486
George, remember...

1:44:47.579 --> 1:44:49.540
I love you.

1:46:11.538 --> 1:46:12.664
Thank you.

1:46:14.333 --> 1:46:15.918
You should go.

1:46:23.217 --> 1:46:24.635
Goodbye.
