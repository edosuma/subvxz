YOU COULD LOSE
A LITTLE PADDING HERE.

02:27.060 --> 02:28.288
CAREFUL.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.222
ONLY GOOD LI'I'I'LE GIRLS

02:30.230 --> 02:32.551

THE FAGGOTY ELVES.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.427
CAN I HELP IT IF THE ELVES
THINK I'M A STUD ?

02:35.430 --> 02:36.749
YOU ARE A STUD.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.625

03:09.360 --> 03:11.396
( horn )

03:11.400 --> 03:13.721
( crashing sounds )

03:26.660 --> 03:30.448
OH, THE WEATHER OUTSIDE
IS FRIGHTFUL

03:30.460 --> 03:32.121
YOU TOLD ME
DONALD GREEN WAS JEWISH.

03:32.130 --> 03:35.952
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, HIS SHOP
WAS CLOSED ON YOM KIPPUR.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.929
HE SENT US A CHRISTMAS CARD
WITH THE BABY JESUS ON IT.

03:38.930 --> 03:40.420
SO, HE'S NOT JEWISH.

03:42.730 --> 03:44.391
NOW HE THINKS
WE'RE JEWISH.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.856
IS BRENDA JEWISH ?

03:45.860 --> 03:48.499
UH, YEAH, SORT OF.

03:48.500 --> 03:52.288
HER DAD'S JEWISH, HER MOM
WAS RAISED CATHOLIC, I THINK.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.757
BUT NOW
THEY'RE ATH EISTS.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.193
I THINK.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.021
WELL, HOW WOULD
YOUR CHILDREN BE RAISED ?

03:59.030 --> 04:01.658
WELL, WE HAVEN'T GOTI'EN
THAT FAR YET, MOM.

04:01.660 --> 04:04.925
IS SHE COMING
TO CHRISTMAS DINNER ?

04:04.930 --> 04:06.249
I'M MAKING MY LIST.

04:06.260 --> 04:07.591
THAT'S THE PLAN.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.828
CHRISTMAS EVE
AT HER MOTHER'S PLACE

04:08.830 --> 04:10.354
AND THEN CHRISTMAS
DINNER HERE.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.248
SO, I'LL WRITE YOU
DOWN FOR TWO.

04:12.260 --> 04:14.694
DAVID ?

04:14.700 --> 04:16.622
YOU CAN PUT ME
DOWN FOR ONE.

04:16.630 --> 04:17.949
WHAT ABOUT KEITH ?

04:17.960 --> 04:18.858
AREN'T THE TWO
OF YOU...

04:20.960 --> 04:23.394
YES, WE'RE HAVING HEALTHY
AFFECT ION-BASED SEX

04:23.400 --> 04:24.822
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

04:24.830 --> 04:26.297
TWICE A DAY
SOMETIMES.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.258
WHY WOULDN'T YOU BRING HIM
HERE FOR CHRISTMAS ?

04:29.260 --> 04:30.420
ARE YOU
ASHAMED OF US ?

04:30.430 --> 04:31.692
OF COURSE NOT.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.258
KEITH HAS TAYLOR
LIVING WITH HIM NOW,

04:33.260 --> 04:34.625
THEY'RE HAVING
THEIR OWN CHRISTMAS.

04:34.630 --> 04:35.892
SO, INVITE THEM BOTH.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.390
I'M COOKING A GOOSE,
DON'T THEY LIKE GOOSE ?

04:37.400 --> 04:38.719
DO YOU REALLY
WANT THEM HERE

04:38.730 --> 04:40.493
OR ARE YOU JUST BEING
POLITICALLY CORRECT ?

04:40.500 --> 04:41.899
OF COURSE I WANT
THEM TO BE HERE.

04:41.900 --> 04:44.994
IF HE'S SOMEONE YOU CARE ABOUT,
THEN HE SHOULD BE HERE.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.422
OKAY--

04:46.430 --> 04:48.421
I AM SICK AND TIRED OF THIS CHIP
ON YOUR SHOULDER, DAVID !

04:48.430 --> 04:50.057
HOW ON EARTH
AM I SUPPOSED TO ACCEPT YOU

04:50.060 --> 04:52.119
IF YOU RESENT EVERY
SINGLE A'I'I'EMPT I MAKE ?!

04:52.130 --> 04:53.358
ALRIGHT, FINE.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.225
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT.

04:55.230 --> 04:56.788
I'LL ASK HIM THEN.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.291
YOU BOTH HAVE PLANS
FOR CHRISTMAS EVE ?

05:00.300 --> 05:03.155
WHO'S GOING TO
MIDNIGHT SERVICE WITH ME ?

05:07.400 --> 05:08.924
CLAIRE ?

05:08.930 --> 05:11.819
I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO GO TO CHURCH
WITH ME TOMORROW NIGHT.

05:11.830 --> 05:13.422
UH--

05:13.430 --> 05:14.897
AND I NEED TO KNOW
IF YOU'RE BRINGING ANYONE

05:14.900 --> 05:16.299
TO CHRISTMAS DINNER.

05:16.300 --> 05:19.394
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
MAYBE ASKING TOBY.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.924
TOBY ?

05:20.930 --> 05:22.124
I DON'T KNOW
ANY TOBY.

05:22.130 --> 05:23.950
I MET HIM AT
AUNT SARAH'S.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.518
WE'VE BEEN OUT
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

05:25.530 --> 05:28.522
DOESN'T TOBY
HAVE A FAMILY OF HIS OWN

05:28.530 --> 05:30.122
TO SPEND
CHRISTMAS WITH ?

05:30.130 --> 05:32.098
HIS PARENTS
ARE PAGANS.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.625
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

05:34.630 --> 05:36.894
WELL, WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO INVITE HIM ?

05:36.900 --> 05:38.652
I NEED TO KNOW
HOW MANY YAMS TO BUY !

05:38.660 --> 05:39.991
LOOK, IF HE'S COMING,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.025
I'LL TELL HIM
TO BRING HIS OWN YAM.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.648
AND WHEN ARE WE GOING TO
DECORATE THE TREE ?

05:45.660 --> 05:47.298
MOM, YOU NEED
TO CALM DOWN.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.995
CHRISTMAS IS THE DAY
AFTER TOMORROW.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.126
WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT ?

05:50.130 --> 05:51.290
WELL, I CAN'T,
I MADE PLANS.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.756
ME, TOO.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.649
I'M ALREADY
DOING THE CHURCH THING.

05:55.660 --> 05:58.390
I WISH I KNEW WHAT
I DID TO DESERVE

05:58.400 --> 06:00.857
SUCH MOROSE,
SURLY CHILDREN.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.323
I'LL BE SO GLAD WHEN THESE
FUCKING HOLIDAYS ARE OVER.

06:10.730 --> 06:12.049
BABY, YOU'RE
MAKING IT WORSE.

06:12.060 --> 06:14.096
HOW COME YOU CAN
MAKE SOMEONE

06:14.100 --> 06:15.897
WITH A SQUASHED FACE
LOOK LIKE NEW,

06:15.900 --> 06:17.925
BUT YOU CAN'T EVEN
FIX A STUPID WALL ?

06:17.930 --> 06:20.592
IT'S THE SHEETROCK,
IT ALL CRUMBLED.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.192
I KNOW, I'M STILL
PICKING IT OUT OF THE COUCH.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.656
OKAY, VANESSA,

06:23.660 --> 06:26.049
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT ELSE
I'VE DONE WRONG LATELY ?

06:26.060 --> 06:28.255
RICO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU FIRED RAMON.

06:28.260 --> 06:29.921
HE WAS DOING GOOD WORK,
HE WAS CHEAP.

06:29.930 --> 06:32.694
I HAD MY REASONS.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.588
I THINK YOU'RE JEALOUS

06:34.600 --> 06:35.794
'CAUSE HE KNOWS
HOW TO FIX THINGS

06:35.800 --> 06:36.858
AND HE MAKES YOU
LOOK BAD.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.828
I DON'T WANT HIM
AROUND HERE ANYMORE.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.388
LOOK AT YOU, RICO,
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.655
ALRIGHT, YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHYI FIRED HIM, YEAH ?

06:44.660 --> 06:47.788
WHEN I CAME HOME THAT AFTERNOON,
HE WAS SCREWING SOMEONE.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.950
YEAH, A MAN !

06:49.960 --> 06:51.552
RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT AGAINST THIS WALL.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.494
RICO, THAT'S DISGUSTING,
STOP LYING !

06:53.500 --> 06:54.558
I'M NOT LYING.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.993
HE WAS SCREWING
A FRIGGING MAN !

06:56.000 --> 06:58.093
RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT IN MY FUCKING HOUSE !

06:58.100 --> 06:59.453
HE WAS SCREWING A MAN.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.997
OH, MY GOD.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.424
RAMON ?

07:05.430 --> 07:08.092
AND THAT'S WHY
I FIRED HIM, OKAY ?

07:08.100 --> 07:10.591
OH, MY GOD.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.489
OKAY, IF YOU WERE
A GAY MORTICIAN,

07:13.500 --> 07:15.149
WHAT WOULD YOU WANT
FOR CHRISTMAS ?

07:15.160 --> 07:18.857
UM, A NEW LIFE ?

07:20.360 --> 07:21.896
UGH, I HATE CHRISTMAS.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.299
I HEAR YOU.

07:23.300 --> 07:27.157
IT'S SUCH PRESSURE
TO LIVE UP TO THESE IMAGES OF,

07:27.160 --> 07:29.993
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE FAMILY
SITTING AROUND THE DINNER TABLE

07:30.000 --> 07:32.696
AS MOM, DRESSED IN HER
SPECIAL CHRISTMAS APRON,

07:32.700 --> 07:35.589
SERVES A MEAL THAT
SHE SPENT THREE DAYS MAKING.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.056
I MEAN,
WHO HAS THAT ?

07:37.060 --> 07:39.221
I DO.

07:39.230 --> 07:40.891
YOU'RE KIDDING.

07:40.900 --> 07:43.050
NO, JUST ADD
THE SMELL OF DEATH

07:43.060 --> 07:45.392
AND PEOPLE CRYING DOWNSTAIRS,
YOU'VE GOT MY LIFE EXACTLY.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.654
IT DOESN'T SOUND
HALF BAD, ACTUALLY.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.423
IT'S AWFUL.

07:50.430 --> 07:52.421
NO, AWFUL IS...

07:52.430 --> 07:54.455
WHEN YOU CELEBRATE
THE WINTER SOLSTICE

07:54.460 --> 07:56.121
BY WATCHING YOUR FATHER
PLAY THE RECORDER

07:56.130 --> 07:58.394
WHILE YOUR MOTHER DANCES
AROUND A BONFIRE,

07:58.400 --> 08:00.391
CHANTING HYMNS TO GAIA,
THE EARTH-GODDESS.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.857
OH, SURE,
IT'S FUNNY TO YOU.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.159
OKAY, SO, DO YOU WANT
TO HAVE CHRISTMAS DINNER

08:10.160 --> 08:11.627
WITH MY
CREEPY FAMILY ?

08:11.630 --> 08:13.325
ARE YOU KIDDING,
I WOULD LOVE IT.

08:13.330 --> 08:14.922
YOU REALLY
WANT ME TO ?

08:14.930 --> 08:16.591
WELL, IT WAS
MY MOTHER'S IDEA.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.990
EVER SINCE MY LAST BOYFRIEND
TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.151
ROBBED A STORE,
AND SHOT AT A GUY

08:23.160 --> 08:24.491
BEFORE DISAPPEARING
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH,

08:24.500 --> 08:26.354
SHE WANTS TO MEET
EVERYONE I DATE.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.653
A BIKER FUNERAL ?

08:30.660 --> 08:31.752
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,

08:31.760 --> 08:32.749
BUT THEY SEEM LIKE
PRETTY COOL PEOPLE.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.250
ARE YOU KIDDING,
I LOVE BIKER FUNERALS.

08:34.260 --> 08:35.659
THESE PEOPLE
HAVE BIG MONEY.

08:35.660 --> 08:38.128
THEY ALL HAVE HARLEY DEALERSHIPS
OR REPAIR SHOPS--

08:38.130 --> 08:39.893
AND METHAMPHETAMINE LABS
IN THEIR BASEMENTS.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.824
WHATEVER,
MONEY IS MONEY.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.099
MRS. JOHNSON,
I'M DAVID FISHER.

08:49.100 --> 08:50.692
I'M VERY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR LOSS.

08:50.700 --> 08:51.792
THANK YOU.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.098
THIS IS PETE, A CLOSE FRIEND
OF THE DECEASED.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.328
THIS IS MY BROTHER,
DAVID.

08:55.330 --> 08:58.026
AND THIS IS MARILYN'S
BROTHER, BITSY.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.793
AS IN "ITSY".

09:01.230 --> 09:02.356
SO...

09:02.360 --> 09:05.090
IS THERE A CASKET
THAT APPEALS TO YOU ?

09:05.100 --> 09:06.624
IT'S GOTTA BE STEEL.

09:06.630 --> 09:10.088
WELL, THE CAMRY HERE IS
20 GAUGE STAINLESS STEEL--

09:10.100 --> 09:12.056
THAT SOUNDS FOREIGN.

09:12.060 --> 09:14.051
NO, I ASSURE YOU
IT'S BUILT RIGHT HERE

09:14.060 --> 09:15.755
IN THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.193
ALRIGHT.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.293
AS LONG AS
IT'S THE BEST.

09:19.300 --> 09:22.497
JESSE NEVER LIKED
TO HAVE A FUSS MADE OVER HIM.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.219
HE ALWAYS SAID THAT
WHEN HIS TIME COMES JUST...

09:25.230 --> 09:28.358
SET HIM OUT BY THE CURB
ON TRASH DAY.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.999
BUT...

09:33.000 --> 09:34.490
I WANT TO DO
RIGHT BY HIM.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.354
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.918
HE WAS
THE FUCKING BEST.

09:37.930 --> 09:40.922
NOW, WE WANT
THE CASKET AIRBRUSHED,

09:40.930 --> 09:42.795
THE SAME AS
HIS GAS TANK,

09:42.800 --> 09:45.792
MIDNIGHT PURPLE
WITH ORANGE FLAMES.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.121
I'M NOT SURE
THAT WE CAN--

09:48.130 --> 09:50.690
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE NUMBER OF THE GUY
THAT'S RESTORING JESSE'S HOG,

09:50.700 --> 09:52.019
HE CAN DO IT
ALL AT ONCE.

09:52.030 --> 09:54.157
WOW, THAT IS A HELL
OF A BIKE.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.525
AND ON THE INSIDE
OF THE CASKET LID,

09:55.530 --> 09:58.124
WE WANT A PICTURE
OF MARILYN HERE.

09:58.130 --> 10:01.759
YOU KNOW, SO, SHE'S LOOKING
DOWN ON HIM FOR ALL ETERNITY.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.827
THAT WAS JESSE'S
FAVORITE PICTURE OF ME.

10:05.830 --> 10:09.459
IT WAS HUSTLER'S "BEAVER HUNT,"
APRIL OF '86.

10:09.460 --> 10:10.825
IT'S...

10:10.830 --> 10:13.424
A VERY NICE
PICTURE OF YOU.

10:13.430 --> 10:14.692
ISN'T IT ?

10:14.700 --> 10:16.691
I USUALLY HATE
PICTURES OF MYSELF.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.021
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A COUPLE KEGS OF BUD

10:19.030 --> 10:21.555
AND A CASE OF JACK
FOR THE SERVICE.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.255
WE WANT THIS
DONE RIGHT.

10:23.260 --> 10:26.991
IT'S GONNA BE ONE BIG-ASS
CHRISTMAS DAY FUNERAL.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.493
I'M SORRY.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.628
CHRISTMAS IS
THE ONE DAY OF THE YEAR
WE DON'T HOLD SERVICES.

10:34.630 --> 10:36.325
WE'LL PAY
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

10:36.330 --> 10:39.424
A BIG-ASS CHRISTMAS DAY
FUNERAL IT IS.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.723
SO, WE'RE GONNA BE
WORKING ON CHRISTMAS DAY.

10:46.130 --> 10:48.018
WE'VE HAD
WORSE CHRISTMASES.

10:48.030 --> 10:51.329
YEAH, WE HAVE.

10:54.060 --> 10:56.551
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM ?

10:59.300 --> 11:01.052
NO.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.027
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S THANKSGIVING ALREADY.

11:06.030 --> 11:07.793
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THIS YEAR ?

11:07.800 --> 11:10.496
I KNOW, AND YOU CAN'T
EVEN GO ANYWHERE

11:10.500 --> 11:11.797
THAT ISN'T
ALL DECKED OUT

11:11.800 --> 11:14.360
WITH CANDY CANES
AND SANTA HEADS AND SHIT.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.520
IT'S ALL SO PHONY.

11:15.530 --> 11:17.418
I THINK IN HELL...

11:17.430 --> 11:19.796
IT'S ALWAYS CHRISTMAS.

11:22.060 --> 11:23.891
OH, MY GOD.

11:28.130 --> 11:29.859
HEY, BUDDY BOY.

11:31.230 --> 11:32.720
WHAT'RE YOU DOING
OUT HERE ?

11:32.730 --> 11:34.322
I HAD TO TAKE A BREAK.

11:34.330 --> 11:35.729
TOO MUCH FOOD.

11:35.730 --> 11:37.925
YOUR MOTHER'S
BEEN BAKING ALL WEEK.

11:37.930 --> 11:42.151
YEAH, WELL, SHE OUTDID
HERSELF THIS YEAR.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.698
SO, HOW'S SEATTLE
TREATING YOU ?

11:45.700 --> 11:47.520
IT'S ALRIGHT,
I GUESS.

11:47.530 --> 11:49.225
I GOT NO COMPLAINTS.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.424
ME, NEITHER.

11:50.430 --> 11:52.250
NOT MANY PEOPLE
CAN SAY THAT.

11:52.260 --> 11:54.399
YOU KNOW,
AND MEAN IT.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.992
YEAH.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.595
I GUESS WE GOT A LOT
TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.353
EITHER THAT OR WE'VE LOWERED
OUR EXPECTATIONS SO MUCH

12:02.360 --> 12:05.397
WE'VE GIVEN UP ON
ANYTHING BETTER THAN THIS.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.791
BOY, OH, BOY.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.925
LISTEN, I GOTTA
PICK UP A BODY,

12:20.930 --> 12:23.899
SO, I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO DRIVE YOU TO THE AIRPORT.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.652
THAT'S OKAY,
I CAN TAKE HIM.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.696
THANK YOU, KITTEN.

12:29.460 --> 12:31.155
YOU COMING DOWN
FOR CHRISTMAS ?

12:31.160 --> 12:32.718
I THINK SO.

12:32.730 --> 12:35.449
I GOTTA SEE HOW
MY SCHEDULE WORKS OUT.

12:35.460 --> 12:36.950
WELL...

12:36.960 --> 12:39.053
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, SON.

12:39.060 --> 12:41.597
YOU TOO, DAD.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.488
TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

13:07.030 --> 13:09.396
ANYTHING I CAN
HELP YOU WITH ?

13:09.400 --> 13:11.197
YES, I'M LOOKING
FOR CLOTHES SO EXPENSIVE

13:11.200 --> 13:13.452
ONLY AN IDIOT
WOULD BUY THEM.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.597
OH, THERE THEY ARE.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.222
EXCUSE ME.

14:21.230 --> 14:22.629
BE MY GUEST.

15:15.860 --> 15:17.191
( female )
EXCUSE ME.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.998
YOUR WIFE WOULD LIKE YOU
TO SEE HOW SHE LOOKS

15:21.000 --> 15:23.696
IN HER JIL SANDER'S
SWEATER.

15:26.700 --> 15:28.156
AND I THINK
YOU SHOULD LEAVE

15:28.160 --> 15:30.856
OR I'LL HAVE
TO CALL SECURITY.

15:30.860 --> 15:33.021
DO YOU VALIDATE ?

15:36.730 --> 15:38.527
YOU SMELL GOOD.

15:38.530 --> 15:40.691
IT'S THE FLOWERS.

15:40.700 --> 15:43.157
YOU ARE
SO BEAUTIFUL.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.855
I AM NOT.

15:44.860 --> 15:48.421
DID YOU NOT WEAR PANTIES
TODAY LIKE I ASKED ?

15:48.430 --> 15:52.025
I MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT
NOT WEAR PANTIES TODAY.

15:52.030 --> 15:54.055
WHY NOT ?

15:54.060 --> 15:56.119
IT'S UNHYGIENIC.

15:58.630 --> 16:00.928
WHAT KIND OF PANTIES
DID YOU WEAR ?

16:00.930 --> 16:02.955
SOMETHING SEXY ?

16:02.960 --> 16:04.848
NO, THEY ARE NOT SEXY.

16:04.860 --> 16:07.499
THEY ARE FRUIT OF THE LOOM
CONTROL TOP BRIEFS

16:07.500 --> 16:10.958
AND THEY COME THREE TO A PACK
FOR 15 DOLLARS AT TARGET.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.958
I WANT YOU TO GO
INTO THE BATHROOM
AND TAKE THEM OFF

16:17.960 --> 16:20.258
AND THEN HIDE THEM
SOMEPLACE IN MY OFFICE.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.148
I WILL NOT.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.458
AND I WISH YOU'D STOP
TALKING TO ME THAT WAY.

16:24.460 --> 16:27.349
YOU DON'T LIKE
WHEN I TALK DIRTY ?

16:27.360 --> 16:28.952
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.894
I DON'T LIKE IT HERE

16:30.900 --> 16:32.253
AT WORK !

16:39.800 --> 16:44.123
WHEN I WAS SHOPPING TODAY,
THIS TOTAL STRANGER FELT ME UP.

16:44.130 --> 16:45.995
WELL, THAT'S IRRITATING.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.092
NO, IT WAS REALLY HOT.

16:47.100 --> 16:50.092
HE WAS GIVING ME
THE EYE,

16:50.100 --> 16:52.796
AND SO, I WENT OVER
AND STOOD RIGHT NEXT TO HIM,

16:52.800 --> 16:54.222
LIKE WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT, PAL ?

16:54.230 --> 16:57.154
AND HE PUTS
HIS HAND ON MY ASS,

16:57.160 --> 16:58.957
VERY TENTATIVELY...

16:58.960 --> 17:02.350
I KNOW,
IT WAS SO POLITE.

17:03.730 --> 17:05.527
SO, I TOOK HIS HAND

17:05.530 --> 17:08.090
AND I JUST
PUT IT INSIDE ME.

17:08.100 --> 17:09.192
OH!

17:10.860 --> 17:13.795
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE
GONNA DO IT, DO IT.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.121
WOW.

17:18.430 --> 17:21.092
DOES THIS MEAN YOU HAVE,
I DON'T KNOW...

17:21.100 --> 17:23.591
MAYBE SOME MIXED FEELINGS
ABOUT MARRYING NATE ?

17:23.600 --> 17:26.194
NO.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.553
NO, SERIOUSLY,
THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL.

17:30.560 --> 17:34.929
I THINK IT'S JUST NATURAL
BIOLOGICAL DRIVE AT WORK.

17:34.930 --> 17:36.659
THE NEED TO SAMPLE

17:36.660 --> 17:39.595
AS DIVERSE A SELECTION
OF PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE

17:39.600 --> 17:42.694
BEFORE SETTLING DOWN
WITH ONE MATE.

17:42.700 --> 17:45.157
IT'S NORMAL.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.924
ANYWAY, I GOT
ANOTHER CHAPTER OUT OF IT.

18:17.260 --> 18:20.320
DAD, DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE JAUNDICE SOLUTION IS ?

18:20.330 --> 18:22.218
MRS. DOYLE'S
LOOKING VERY YELLOW.

18:22.230 --> 18:23.254
IT'S BACK-ORDERED.

18:23.260 --> 18:25.148
USE THE COLORGUARD,
10 OUNCES A GALLON.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.889
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.356
HERE,

18:28.360 --> 18:30.419
HAVE SOME EGGNOG.

18:30.430 --> 18:33.092
THIS ISN'T EGGNOG,

18:33.100 --> 18:34.453
IT'S WHISKEY.

18:34.460 --> 18:35.324
WHISKEY ?

18:35.330 --> 18:36.752
THAT'S RUM,
MY BOY !

18:36.760 --> 18:38.318
THE DRINK OF HOLIDAYS.

18:38.330 --> 18:40.298
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE,

18:40.300 --> 18:42.689
YOU ALWAYS WANTED
TO LEAVE MILK AND COOKIES

18:42.700 --> 18:45.260
OUT ON THE TRAY FOR SANTA CLAUS,
YOU REMEMBER THAT ?

18:45.260 --> 18:46.295
YEAH.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.029
YOU USED TO ALWAYS
LAUGH AND SAY,

18:48.030 --> 18:50.555
"WHAT SANTA REALLY
NEEDS IS A SHOT."

18:50.560 --> 18:52.255
AND I WAS RIGHT.

18:52.260 --> 18:53.852
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU MEANT A SHOT,

18:53.860 --> 18:55.896
LIKE A SHOT
OF PENICILLIN.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.621
WELL, I SHOULD--

19:02.630 --> 19:04.723
DAVID, IT'S CHRISTMAS.

19:04.730 --> 19:06.095
C'MON.

19:06.100 --> 19:08.352
SPEND A LITTLE TIME
AMONG THE LIVING.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.597
SIT DOWN WITH YOUR POP
AND TELL ME WHAT
YOU WANT FOR CHRISTMAS.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.191
MRS. DOYLE'S
VIEWING'S AT FOUR.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.524
MOM SAID SHE MIGHT HAVE
A SPECIAL GUEST FOR DINNER.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.498
ALRIGHT.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.995
IF HE'S ANYTHING LIKE
HER PAST "SPECIAL GUESTS,"

19:49.000 --> 19:51.594
HE'S A 24-YEAR-OLD
VENEZUELAN POOL BOY

19:51.600 --> 19:52.953
WHO MAKES UP FOR
HIS LACK OF ENGLISH

19:52.960 --> 19:55.292
BY BEING FLUENT IN THE LANGUAGE
OF POWER-FUCKING.

19:55.300 --> 19:58.656
THEN I'LL TRY NOT TO GET
INTO A CONVERSATION WITH HIM.

20:01.230 --> 20:02.356
HEY, BREN.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.998
HOLD ON
JUST A SEC.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.458
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
A YEAR AGO TODAY ?

20:09.900 --> 20:11.026
OH, NATE.

20:11.030 --> 20:13.191
OH, GOD, I'M SORRY,
YOUR FATHER--

20:13.200 --> 20:15.054
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.424
IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.

20:18.430 --> 20:19.988
OH, MY GOD.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.956
OF COURSE.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.689
IT'S KIND OF
HARD TO BELIEVE

20:23.700 --> 20:25.725
THAT IT WAS ONLY A YEAR AGO
THAT WE MET, ISN'T IT ?

20:25.730 --> 20:27.823
YEAH, IT FEELS LIKE
20 YEARS.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.188
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

20:30.200 --> 20:32.259
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE WITH ME,
THEN DON'T, ALRIGHT ?

20:32.260 --> 20:33.796
NATE, I'M KIDDING,
COME ON.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.155
OF COURSE I WANT
TO BE WITH YOU,

20:36.160 --> 20:37.752
I LOVE YOU.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.648
THEN WHY DO YOU TREAT ME
LIKE SHIT ALL THE TIME ?

20:39.660 --> 20:41.651
BECAUSE I HAD A REALLY
FUCKED UP LIFE

20:41.660 --> 20:44.220
AND I USE SARCASM TO HIDE
HOW RIDICULOUSLY VULNERABLE

20:44.230 --> 20:46.391
I REALLY AM, OKAY ?

20:46.400 --> 20:48.356
COME ON, JESUS,
YOU KNOW THAT.

20:50.330 --> 20:52.150
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.220
I KNOW I ALREADY GOT YOU
ANOTHER RING, BUT...

20:56.430 --> 20:57.852
OH...

21:00.830 --> 21:02.525
I CAN'T BELIEVE--

21:02.530 --> 21:05.294
HEY, IT WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S,
IT DIDN'T COST ME ANYTHING.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.691
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.622
( sniffling )

21:17.060 --> 21:18.755
HEY, HEY.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.455
IT'S OKAY.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.621
IT'S OKAY.

21:22.630 --> 21:24.495
I LOVE YOU.

21:27.860 --> 21:30.158
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME !

21:30.160 --> 21:31.855
HEY, MOM,
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

21:31.860 --> 21:34.055
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU.

21:35.630 --> 21:37.188
OH, NATE.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.792
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.758
I KNOW THERE'S SOME MISTLETOE
AROUND HERE SOMEPLACE,

21:41.760 --> 21:43.899
GODDAMNIT.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.697
WHAT'S WRONG, HONEY,
YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT ?

21:45.700 --> 21:47.588
ENJOYING A SCOTCH,
MOM ?

21:47.600 --> 21:49.056
NOT NEARLY ENOUGH.

21:49.060 --> 21:52.393
SWEETHEART, WOULD YOU
FRESHEN UP MY DRINK ?

21:56.500 --> 21:58.718
HO-HO-HO.

22:00.130 --> 22:02.951
COME ON, GIVE YOUR SISTER
A BIG KISS !

22:06.300 --> 22:07.597
HEY.

22:09.660 --> 22:12.549
I TOLD YOU WE WERE
HAVING A SPECIAL GUEST !

22:12.560 --> 22:13.959
YES...

22:13.960 --> 22:16.895
I JUST
DIDN'T EXPECT --

22:16.900 --> 22:19.789
TO SEE YOUR
CRAZY BROTHER, SURE.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.495
DON'T WORRY, THEY PUMPED
SO MUCH ELECTRICITY THROUGH ME,

22:21.500 --> 22:23.855
I COULD LIGHT UP
THE EASTERN SEABOARD.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.353
I'M KIDDING,
SORRY, BREN.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.590
COME ON, LIGHTEN UP,
IT'S CHRISTMAS.

22:31.130 --> 22:32.154
BILLY.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.196
NATE.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.289
COME ON, GO GET ME
ANOTHER DRINK.

22:37.300 --> 22:38.756
OKAY.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.058
OKAY, MOM, WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING HERE ?

22:41.060 --> 22:43.494
I BUSTED HIM OUT
FOR CHRISTMAS !

22:43.500 --> 22:45.092
WELL, YOU COULD'VE
WARNED ME.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.522
WARNED YOU ?

22:46.530 --> 22:49.328
YOU NEED TO BE WARNED ABOUT
SEEING YOUR OWN BROTHER ?

22:49.330 --> 22:52.026
EVER SINCE HE CAME AT ME
WITH A KNIFE, YEAH.

22:52.030 --> 22:53.759
BRENDA.

22:53.760 --> 22:57.594
OKAY, SO HOW LONG
IS HE OUT FOR ?

22:58.660 --> 23:00.196
FOR GOOD !

23:00.200 --> 23:02.498
HE'S LIVING
WITH ME NOW.

23:10.430 --> 23:13.319
SO, I GUESS
YOU'RE HAPPY TO BE HOME.

23:13.330 --> 23:17.494
HAPPY'S A CONCEPT
I TRY NOT TO BUY INTO,

23:17.500 --> 23:20.060
IT JUST GETS ME
INTO TROUBLE.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.956
LISTEN, NATE...

23:28.460 --> 23:31.395
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.121
I KNOW I HAVE TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT I DID,

23:36.130 --> 23:38.155
BUT I WAS...

23:38.160 --> 23:39.457
SICK.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.553
AND NOW
YOU'RE NOT ?

23:48.900 --> 23:50.197
I'M STILL SICK.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.793
I'LL ALWAYS BE SICK,

23:53.800 --> 23:56.951
IT'S JUST THE CARDS
I WAS DEALT.

23:58.330 --> 23:59.957
I CAN MANAGE IT
THROUGH MEDICATION.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.393
FOR THE MOST PART.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.618
BUT IT'S SOMETHING
I'LL HAVE TO LIVE WITH

24:03.630 --> 24:05.723
FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.052
IT'S NOT UP TO ME.

24:11.130 --> 24:12.620
( female )
MERRY CHRISTMAS !

24:12.630 --> 24:14.120
MERRY CHRISTMAS !

24:14.130 --> 24:16.155
WE CAN'T STAY LONG, BECAUSE
MY MOTHER IS WATCHING THE KIDS.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.027
RAMON, YOU SHAVED,
YOU LOOK SO YOUNG.

24:19.030 --> 24:20.850
( Ramon )
WE BROUGHT SOME PRESENTS
FOR THE BOYS.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.657
THANK YOU,
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

24:22.660 --> 24:24.594
JUST LITTLE THINGS,
WHERE ARE THEY ?

24:24.600 --> 24:25.726
AUGUSTO'S ASLEEP

24:25.730 --> 24:27.254
AND JULIO'S IN THE DEN
WATCHING "THE GRINCH"

24:27.260 --> 24:28.852
FOR ABOUT
THE THOUSANDTH TIME.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.991
I'LL JUST PUT THESE
UNDER THE TREE.

24:33.660 --> 24:35.150
OH, PLEASE.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.991
YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN
THAT WALL FIXED YET ?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.798
RAMON WOULD'VE HAD IT
FINISHED BY NOW.

24:41.300 --> 24:43.325
WHAT POSSESSED YOU
TO MAKE FIG PUDDING ?

24:43.330 --> 24:45.195
IT SOUNDED
CH RISTMASSY.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.555
WELL, IT LOOKS
LIKE THROW-UP.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.858
NONE OF IT
WAS VERY GOOD.

24:49.860 --> 24:52.556
HEY, BE NICE.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.822
MAKE BETTER STUFF.

24:53.830 --> 24:57.891
HOW ABOUT IF WE SING
SOME CHRISTMAS CAROLS ?

24:59.430 --> 25:01.489
I GOT A CD, WE CAN
ALL SING ALONG TO IT.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.149
YOU'VE GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.128
COME ON, WE'LL SCARE
THE NEIGHBORS.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.291
OKAY, YOU TWO
SING SONGS.

25:07.300 --> 25:10.326
I'M GONNA GOT GET A DING-DONG
AND WATCH "THE SIMPSONS".

25:12.360 --> 25:13.691
MOTH ERFUCK.

25:13.700 --> 25:15.190
KEITH, RELAX.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.896
I JUST WANTED HER
TO HAVE A GOOD CHRISTMAS.

25:17.900 --> 25:20.152
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT SHE'S BEEN THROUGH.

25:20.160 --> 25:23.459
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
YOURSELF LATELY, OKAY ?

25:25.960 --> 25:28.895
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE A DOORMAT.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.824
ARE YOU SLEEPING
ANY BETTER ?

25:42.830 --> 25:43.797
NOT REALLY.

25:45.300 --> 25:46.597
YOU KNOW, I WAS
READING AN ARTICLE

25:46.600 --> 25:48.090
ABOUT
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS--

25:48.100 --> 25:50.295
I'M NOT SUFFERING
FROM ANYTHING, OKAY, DAVID ?

25:50.300 --> 25:51.892
WHAT HAPPENED HAPPENED,
IT'S A PART OF MY JOB.

25:51.900 --> 25:54.494
LET'S JUST MOVE ON.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.323
WHY DON'T YOU AND TAYLOR
COME OVER TO MY HOUSE

26:08.330 --> 26:09.820
FOR CHRISTMAS
DINNER TOMORROW ?

26:09.830 --> 26:10.956
WHY ?

26:10.960 --> 26:13.224
BECAUSE I'D LIKE
FOR YOU TO BE THERE.

26:13.230 --> 26:15.892
THEN WHY'D YOU WAIT UNTIL
THE NIGHT BEFORE TO ASK ME ?

26:15.900 --> 26:18.289
BECAUSE MY MOM DIDN'T
BRING IT UP UNTIL YESTERDAY.

26:18.300 --> 26:20.621
OH, YOUR MOTHER.

26:20.630 --> 26:22.097
JESUS, KEITH.

26:22.100 --> 26:24.056
ALL I DID WAS INVITE YOU
OVER FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER.

26:24.060 --> 26:28.520
I DON'T THINK
TAYLOR'S QUITE READY

26:28.530 --> 26:30.623
FOR SOMETHING
LIKE THIS YET.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.825
ARE YOU SURE TAYLOR'S
THE ONE WHO'S NOT READY ?

26:38.330 --> 26:39.649
JUST HELP ME PICK OUT
A FEW POINSETTIAS

26:39.660 --> 26:41.651
AND WE CAN BE
ON OUR WAY TO CHURCH.

26:41.660 --> 26:44.094
DEAR GOD !

26:44.960 --> 26:46.052
WHAT HAPPENED ?

26:46.060 --> 26:48.255
( groaning )

26:50.430 --> 26:51.795
OH, MY GOODNESS.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.199
NIKOLAI !

26:53.200 --> 26:56.192
HELLO, RUTHIE.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.622
WERE YOU ROBBED ?

26:57.630 --> 26:59.291
DID THEY HURT YOU ?

26:59.300 --> 27:01.325
I AM HURT, YES.

27:01.330 --> 27:02.592
WHERE ARE YOU HURT ?

27:02.600 --> 27:03.897
THERE WAS FIGHT.

27:03.900 --> 27:05.788
I BREAK MY LEGS.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.199
WE HAVE TO GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL !

27:07.200 --> 27:10.124
CLAIRE, BACK THE CAR
UP TO THE DOOR.

27:22.430 --> 27:23.454
MOM ?

27:23.460 --> 27:24.529
HMM ?

27:25.560 --> 27:27.391
YOU SHOULD
TAKE THAT DOWN.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.958
NO.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.689
I LOVE IT.

27:30.700 --> 27:32.656
YOU LOOK
SO MYSTERIOUS.

27:32.660 --> 27:34.150
IT'S KIND
OF GHOULISH.

27:34.160 --> 27:37.493
I DON'T LIKE TO THINK OF
MYSELF IN THAT WAY ANYMORE.

27:37.500 --> 27:40.424
THEN YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE A NEW PICTURE FOR ME

27:40.430 --> 27:42.523
OF HOW YOU FEEL NOW.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.494
I KNOW !

27:47.200 --> 27:51.057
YOU SHOULD TAKE BRENDA
AND NATE'S WEDDING PHOTOS !

27:54.630 --> 27:56.621
WE'RE ENGAGED.

28:00.860 --> 28:03.192
CONGRATULATIONS !

28:05.060 --> 28:06.994
THAT IS SO GREAT.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.150
THANK YOU.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.594
I LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE WHO
REALLY SHOULD GET MARRIED...

28:11.600 --> 28:13.227
DO.

28:16.430 --> 28:18.091
DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT OFTEN,
YOU KNOW ?

28:18.100 --> 28:21.820
NOW, YOU JUST HUSH.

28:23.900 --> 28:25.356
IT'S TRUE.

28:29.130 --> 28:31.098
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE GOT
BILLY OUT OF THE HOSPITAL

28:31.100 --> 28:33.318
SO SHE WOULD NOT HAVE
TO SPEND CHRISTMAS ALONE.

28:33.330 --> 28:35.992
FUCKING EVIL BITCH.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.152
HE'S NOT READY.

28:39.160 --> 28:42.095
REALLY, I THOUGHT HE ACTUALLY
SEEMED PRETTY OKAY.

28:42.100 --> 28:44.318
HE'S NOT OKAY,
HE'S SICK !

28:44.330 --> 28:46.924
HE'S SICK, AND NOBODY
WANTS TO DEAL WITH IT,

28:46.930 --> 28:48.795
WHICH IS THE WAY
IT'S ALWAYS FUCKING BEEN !

28:48.800 --> 28:50.688
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
DO IT ANYMORE.

28:50.700 --> 28:52.224
I'VE BEEN
A FUCKING NURSEMAID

28:52.230 --> 28:54.494
MORE THAN ENOUGH
FOR ONE LIFETIME !

28:54.500 --> 28:55.922
( bell )

29:10.000 --> 29:11.592
MERRY CHRISTMAS !

29:11.600 --> 29:14.125
YOU ARE BASH FUL.

29:14.130 --> 29:16.655
DON'T WORRY,
I DON'T SEE NOTHING.

29:16.660 --> 29:18.355
GOOD MORNING, DEAR.

29:18.360 --> 29:19.952
HERE YOU GO.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.450
OH, THANK YOU,
RUTHIE.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.553
YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN
YOUR PAINKILLERS.

29:23.560 --> 29:27.018
I HATE PILLS,
THEY MAKE ME CRAZY.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.349
SHUT UP
AND TAKE THEM.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.123
SHOULDN'T HE BE
IN THE HOSPITAL ?

29:30.130 --> 29:31.950
WE WERE THERE HALF THE NIGHT,
WAITING FOR A DOCTOR,

29:31.960 --> 29:33.427
AFTER YOU LEFT.

29:33.430 --> 29:36.126
AH, THIS IS SO HOT.

29:36.130 --> 29:38.428
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
EVERYBODY !

29:39.560 --> 29:42.051
HE'S GONNA BE HERE
EIGHT WEEKS ?

29:42.060 --> 29:43.789
YOU'VE GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.155
THAT'S HOW LONG HE HAS
TO STAY OFF HIS LEGS.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.549
MOM, SURELY THERE'S
A BETTER ARRANGEMENT.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.289
HE HAS TWO BROKEN LEGS !

29:50.300 --> 29:52.052
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH HIM ?

29:52.060 --> 29:54.927
HE DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE INSURANCE.

29:56.130 --> 29:57.392
WELL, THEN, WHO'S PAYING
FOR ALL HIS--

29:57.400 --> 29:59.288
IAM.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.448
DAVID...

30:03.460 --> 30:07.294
LATER THIS AFTERNOON,
I WANT YOU TO LIFT NIKOLAI

30:07.300 --> 30:09.325
INTO HIS WHEELCHAIR.

30:15.530 --> 30:18.192
(Allman Bros. playing )
AND THERE WAS THAT TIME
WE WERE COMING DOWN THE BIG HILL

30:18.200 --> 30:19.792
NEAR LONE PINE...

30:19.800 --> 30:22.724
AND I HIT A PATCH OF ICE
AND WENT DOWN.

30:22.730 --> 30:25.824
JESSE COMES BARRELLING
AROUND THAT HAIRPIN

30:25.830 --> 30:28.856
AND SEEN ME THERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD,

30:28.860 --> 30:32.626
AND INSTEAD OF
RUNNING ME OVER...

30:34.230 --> 30:36.551
HE LAID HIS BIKE DOWN AND
SLID IT INTO A BUNCH OF TREES,

30:36.560 --> 30:38.858
BUSTED OUT HIS TEETH.

30:40.330 --> 30:43.094
'CAUSE THAT'S JUST THE KIND
OF MAN THAT HE WAS.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.825
A-FUCKING-MEN.

30:52.530 --> 30:53.758
FROM JAY LENO.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.159
SURE, HE ALWAYS
SENDS FLOWERS,

30:55.160 --> 30:57.048
NEVER COMES.

31:01.930 --> 31:03.921
OH, THE "IN-N-OUT"
TRUCK'S OUT BACK.

31:03.930 --> 31:07.297
WELL, WE'RE GONNA PUT ON
JESSE'S FAVORITE SONG

31:07.300 --> 31:11.191
AND FOLKS CAN HELP
THEMSELVES TO SOME GRUB.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.621
( "Born To Be Wild" playing )

31:18.760 --> 31:21.228
MY BROTHER
LIVES UP THERE,

31:21.230 --> 31:22.822
WHICH I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN JEALOUS OF...

31:22.830 --> 31:25.628
OR HIGH,
ONCE WHEN I WAS
IN J+

31:25.630 --> 31:27.825
MY DAD WAS EMBALMING SOMEONE
IN THE BASEMENT

31:27.830 --> 31:30.651
AND, LIKE, THE PLUMBING
GOT BACKED UP

31:30.660 --> 31:33.959
AND BLOOD STARTED SQUIRTING
OUT OF THIS HOSE.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.349
IT WAS LIKE A SCENE
FROM "THE SHINING".

31:36.360 --> 31:37.759
NASTY.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.227
YEAH.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.993
THAT WAS KIND OF THE FIRST TIME
I EVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT

31:41.000 --> 31:42.524
WHAT THEY DID
DOWN THERE.

31:44.930 --> 31:46.295
OH, HELLO.

31:46.300 --> 31:48.188
MOM, THIS IS TOBY.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.952
IT'S VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU, MRS. FISHER.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.154
YOU TOO, TOBY.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.696
THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US TODAY.

31:52.700 --> 31:53.997
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR HAVING ME.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.149
CLAIRE,

31:55.160 --> 31:56.752
SURELY THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU'RE PLANNING TO WEAR

31:56.760 --> 31:58.159
FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.958
NO, MOM, I'VE GOT MY LAURA BUSH
PANTSUIT ON UNDERNEATH.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.121
I JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO GET IT DIRTY.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.025
PLEASE,
COME IN.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.729
SO, WHAT'D YOU GET ME
FOR CHRISTMAS ?

32:22.460 --> 32:24.894
WHO THE FUCK
LIVES IN RESEDA ?

32:24.900 --> 32:26.356
SO, WHAT'D YOU GET ME
FOR CHRISTMAS ?

32:26.360 --> 32:27.896
WHY ARE YOU
EVEN ASKING ME ?

32:27.900 --> 32:29.629
LIKE, YOU'VE BARELY
EVER SPOKEN TO ME.

32:29.630 --> 32:31.655
WHO ELSE IS
GONNA BE THERE ?

32:31.660 --> 32:33.992
I ALWAYS WANTED
A SILK SMOKING JACKET.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.353
DAD--

32:35.360 --> 32:38.727
SOMETHING REALLY GARISH,
WITH BIG EMBROIDERED PEACOCKS.

32:38.730 --> 32:41.324
LOOK, I GOTTA GO.

32:41.330 --> 32:44.458
JUST E-MAIL DIRECTIONS AND MAYBE
I'LL SHOW UP, AND MAYBE I WON'T.

32:47.130 --> 32:49.826
CAN'T A PERSON HAVE A PHONE
CONVERSATION AROUND HERE ?

32:49.830 --> 32:51.457
SOMEBODY SPECIAL, HUH ?

32:51.460 --> 32:52.688
WHAT'S HIS NAME ?

32:52.700 --> 32:54.122
GABRIEL.

32:54.130 --> 32:55.597
AND TRUST ME,
HE'S NOT THAT SPECIAL.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.953
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
WITH HIM, KITTEN,

32:56.960 --> 32:58.951
BECAUSE YOU DESERVE
SOMEBODY SPECIAL.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.621
RIGHT.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.757
LISTEN, YOU WANT TO GO
WITH ME LATER TO THE AIRPORT,

33:02.760 --> 33:04.352
AND PICK UP
YOUR BIG BROTHER ?

33:04.360 --> 33:07.124
OH, I CAN'T, I'VE GOT LIKE
LAST MINUTE SHOPPING TO DO.

33:07.130 --> 33:09.052
COULD YOU TRY TO BE
HOME FOR DINNER ?

33:09.060 --> 33:12.757
'CAUSE WE HARDLY EVER HAVE
THE WHOLE FAMILY TOGETHER AND...

33:20.900 --> 33:22.652
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

33:23.830 --> 33:25.991
WHAT'S GOING
ON IN HERE ?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.649
BIKER FUNERAL.

33:27.660 --> 33:29.594
CAN'T WE JUST
STAY DOWN HERE ?

33:29.600 --> 33:30.897
VERY FUNNY.

33:30.900 --> 33:32.299
HEY, PETE.

33:32.300 --> 33:35.394
SO, WE'RE ABOUT TO HEAD UPSTAIRS
AND HAVE OUR CHRISTMAS DINNER.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.958
SO?

33:36.960 --> 33:38.689
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN
HERE ALL DAY...

33:38.700 --> 33:40.622
AND WE'RE GONNA
BE HERE ALL NIGHT.

33:40.630 --> 33:42.495
YOU GO ON
AND EAT.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.092
WE DON'T NEED YOU.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.927
IT'LL BE FUN.

33:52.930 --> 33:54.557
NIKOLAI'S OUT OF HIS MIND
ON PERCODAN.

33:55.660 --> 33:57.821
WELL, I THINK
THAT'S EVERYTHING.

33:58.700 --> 34:01.260
( sobbing )

34:05.400 --> 34:07.391
DINNER LOOKS AMAZING,
MRS. FISHER.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.595
WELL, THANK YOU, TOBY.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.352
( door slamming )

34:11.360 --> 34:12.725
THAT'S PROBABLY
ONE OF THE BIKERS,

34:12.730 --> 34:14.027
LOOKING FOR
THE BATH ROOM.

34:14.030 --> 34:15.429
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

34:15.430 --> 34:16.556
HELLO...

34:16.560 --> 34:17.697
( Claire )
HEY, KEITH.

34:17.700 --> 34:18.928
YOU MADE IT !

34:18.930 --> 34:20.227
( Keith )
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
EVERYONE.

34:20.230 --> 34:21.390
I HOPE IT'S OKAY
THAT WE CAME BY.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.856
OF COURSE
IT'S OKAY !

34:22.860 --> 34:25.090
WE'RE SO HAPPY
YOU COULD JOIN US.

34:25.100 --> 34:26.590
( Keith )
DOES EVERYONE
KNOW TAYLOR ?

34:26.600 --> 34:29.057
YOUR MOTHER
HASN'T EVEN LOOKED ME
SINCE SHE SAW THE RING.

34:29.060 --> 34:30.357
HAVE SOME MORE WINE.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.622
HEY, KEITH.

34:31.630 --> 34:32.892
HEY, TAYLOR.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.197
THAT'S A SKINNY TURKEY.

34:34.200 --> 34:36.998
IT'S A GOOSE.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.128
WELL, THIS IS LOVELY,
WE'RE ALL HERE TOGETHER.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.626
HI.

34:44.630 --> 34:47.929
KEITH, WOULD YOU SAY
GRACE FOR US ?

34:47.930 --> 34:49.397
UM...

34:50.360 --> 34:51.827
YEAH, SURE.

34:54.300 --> 34:57.724
LORD, FOR FOOD IN A WORLD
WHERE MANY WALK IN HUNGER,

34:57.730 --> 35:01.029
FOR FAITH IN A WORLD
WHERE MANY WALK IN FEAR,

35:01.030 --> 35:04.454
AND FOR FRIENDS IN A WORLD
WHERE MANY WALK ALONE,

35:04.460 --> 35:06.997
WE GIVE YOU THANKS,
0 LORD,

35:07.000 --> 35:08.695
ON THIS CHRISTMAS DAY.

35:08.700 --> 35:11.055
AMEN.

35:13.300 --> 35:14.358
AMEN.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.998

LOVELY, KEITH.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.752
THANK YOU.

35:19.060 --> 35:21.426
( David )
HERE YOU GO,
NIKOLAI.

35:28.730 --> 35:31.221
YOUR MOM WILL
ALWAYS HATE ME.

35:31.230 --> 35:34.791
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE A WOMAN TRYING
TO STEAL HER BABY.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.018
WHATEVER.

35:42.860 --> 35:44.327
SO, TOBY SEEMS NICE.

35:44.330 --> 35:47.493
YES, TOBY'S VERY NICE.

35:47.500 --> 35:51.049
NOT YOUR TYPE, HUH ?

35:51.060 --> 35:54.826
A DERANGED PSYCHOPATH,
NO, I GUESS HE ISN'T.

35:58.530 --> 36:00.088
BILLY TOLD ME
ONCE THAT...

36:00.100 --> 36:02.819
HE GOT SO USED TO LIVING
WITH CRAZY PEOPLE

36:02.830 --> 36:04.650
THAT WHEN HE WAS SHARING
A ROOM WITH A GUY

36:04.660 --> 36:06.753
WHO THOUGHT
HE WAS PINOCCHIO,

36:06.760 --> 36:08.921
THE ONLY THING THAT
SEEMED WEIRD ABOUT IT

36:08.930 --> 36:11.922
WAS THAT THE GUY
PRONOUNCED IT "PINOCCHIO".

36:13.700 --> 36:15.588
SO, YOU'VE BEEN
TALKING TO BILLY ?

36:15.600 --> 36:18.091
YEAH, MOSTLY
THROUGH E-MAIL.

36:18.100 --> 36:20.250
HE'S REALLY FUNNY.

36:20.260 --> 36:22.524
ISN'T HE ?

36:31.130 --> 36:35.521
( Lynyrd Slqnyrd )
THIS BIRD YOU CANNOT CHANGE

36:38.130 --> 36:45.024
AND THIS BIRD
YOU CANNOT CHANGE

36:45.830 --> 36:49.493
LORD KNOWS
I CAN'T CHANGE

36:49.500 --> 36:51.297
I'VE GOT
A HUGE HEADACHE.

36:51.300 --> 36:52.619
CAN WE GO HOME NOW ?

36:52.630 --> 36:54.120
BREN, I'M WORKING.

36:54.130 --> 36:57.759
OKAY, WELL, I'M LEAVING,
COME HOME WHEN YOU CAN, OKAY ?

36:57.760 --> 36:59.853
I PROMISE.

37:03.360 --> 37:06.158
HEY, WHERE DO YOU KEEP
YOUR TOILET PLUNGER ?

37:46.660 --> 37:48.127
MORNING, MR. F.

37:48.130 --> 37:50.348
RICO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE ?

37:50.360 --> 37:53.796
YEAH, I HAVE TO DO MRS. DOYLE,
HER VIEWING IS THIS AFTERNOON.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.392
LET DAVID
TAKE CARE OF HER.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.288
NAH, SHE'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

37:57.300 --> 37:59.154
THAT'S WHY I WANT
DAVID TO DO HER.

37:59.160 --> 38:01.253
I LIKE TO FEED HIM
THE SLOW PITCHES,

38:01.260 --> 38:02.591
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.693
SURE.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.555
I'M SERIOUS, KIDDO,
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

38:07.560 --> 38:08.720
GO HOME.

38:08.730 --> 38:10.322
SPEND THE DAY
WITH THE LITTLE ONE.

38:10.330 --> 38:13.128
THEY GROW UP SO FAST, YOU GOTTA
ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS.

38:13.130 --> 38:14.256
GO ON.

38:16.860 --> 38:18.748
THAN KS, MR. F.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.149
YOU HAVE
A MERRY CHRISTMAS.

38:21.160 --> 38:22.718
I INTEND TO.

38:25.160 --> 38:26.923
( doorbell )

38:38.760 --> 38:40.990
SHE TOOK MY KIDS BACK
TO HER MOTHER'S !

38:41.000 --> 38:42.058
WHAT ?

38:42.060 --> 38:44.449
YOU COULDN'T KEEP
YOUR FUCKING MOUTH SHUT !

38:44.460 --> 38:45.597
I DIDN'T--

38:45.600 --> 38:47.022
RAMON !

38:47.030 --> 38:49.453
STOP, STOP IT !

38:49.460 --> 38:51.325
MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS,
RICO.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.228
BABY, ARE YOU OKAY ?

38:52.230 --> 38:53.458
BABY !

38:53.460 --> 38:54.859
YOU FUCKING
TOLD HER ?!

38:54.860 --> 38:56.828
I HAD TO!

38:56.830 --> 38:58.627
I COULDN'T EVEN
LOOK HER IN THE EYE.

38:58.630 --> 38:59.949
SHE WAS
SO HAPPY YESTERDAY.

38:59.960 --> 39:02.019
SHE TOLD ME SHE BOUGHT HIM
A ROLEX WATCH.

39:02.030 --> 39:03.429
SHE HAS A RIGHT
TO KNOW.

39:03.430 --> 39:05.022
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO FUCKING TELL HER !

39:05.030 --> 39:06.725
BABY, I'M SO SORRY,
I HAD TO !

39:06.730 --> 39:09.790
FUCKING HOMO !

39:09.800 --> 39:11.859
FUCKING FUCK !

39:25.060 --> 39:28.097
( singing )
THE WIND, THE SUN
AND THE RAIN

39:28.100 --> 39:30.455
WE CAN BE
LIKE THEY ARE

39:30.460 --> 39:33.156
THEY MUST NOT LIKE
THAT DEAD MAN TOO MUCH.

39:33.160 --> 39:36.652
WHY DO YOU
SAY THAT ?

39:37.900 --> 39:40.289
'CAUSE THEY'RE ALL
SO HAPPY HE'S DEAD.

39:43.160 --> 39:46.698
HEY, I THINK IT'S ABOUT
TIME WE GET YOU HOME.

39:46.700 --> 39:48.725
BUT IT'S CHRISTMAS,

39:48.730 --> 39:50.789
AND I WANT TO
WATCH THE FUNERAL.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.290
TOO BAD.

39:52.300 --> 39:54.495
I'M REALLY
GLAD YOU CAME.

39:54.500 --> 39:57.355
WHY DON'T YOU
COME BACK WITH US ?

39:57.360 --> 39:59.555
I COULD MAKE SOME
HOT CHOCOLATE AND...

39:59.560 --> 40:01.357
I GOT
A PRESENT OR TWO

40:01.360 --> 40:04.193
THAT I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO OPEN IN MIXED COMPANY.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.199
YUCK.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.622
LET ME
TALK TO NATE.

40:08.630 --> 40:10.689
I'LL SEE IF
WE CAN WRAP THIS UP.

40:18.830 --> 40:21.048
THINK WE SHOULD START
MOVING THEM OUT ?

40:21.060 --> 40:22.459
NAH.

40:22.460 --> 40:24.052
IT'S CHRISTMAS.

40:24.060 --> 40:27.120
IT'S JUST THAT KEITH ASKED IF
I WANTED TO COME BACK WITH HIM.

40:27.130 --> 40:28.449
GO.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.690
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

40:30.700 --> 40:31.997
OKAY.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.627
THAN KS.

40:35.660 --> 40:38.049
MERRY CHRISTMAS, NATE.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.698
YOU, TOO.

40:58.830 --> 41:00.593
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GET OUT OF HERE ?

41:00.600 --> 41:02.192
YOU'RE NOT
HAVING FUN ?

41:02.200 --> 41:04.555
NO, THIS IS LIKE
EVERY PARTY MY PARENTS HAVE,

41:04.560 --> 41:06.448
ONLY WITH
BETTER MUSIC.

41:06.460 --> 41:09.020
WELL, WHERE DO
YOU WANT TO GO ?

41:09.030 --> 41:13.296
WE COULD DRIVE
AROUND HANCOCK PARK,

41:13.300 --> 41:14.949
LOOK AT ALL
THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.598
YEAH, RIGHT.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.091
NOT WITHOUT
A CARTON OF EGGS.

41:20.800 --> 41:23.291
WHY ARE YOU
SO HOSTILE ?

41:23.300 --> 41:26.258
I'M NOT HOSTILE.

41:26.260 --> 41:27.522
YES, YOU ARE.

41:27.530 --> 41:29.919
YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY PUT OUT BY,

41:29.930 --> 41:31.818
I DON'T KNOW,
BEING ALIVE.

41:31.830 --> 41:34.298
AND MAYBE YOU THINK
THAT'S COOL, BUT REALLY...

41:34.300 --> 41:36.495
IT'S JUST IRRITATING.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.422
OKAY...

41:38.430 --> 41:42.628
THANKS FOR THE INPUT,
WHICH IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT,

41:42.630 --> 41:46.657
BUT APPARENTLY YOU NEED TO FEEL
ALL SUPERIOR OR SOMETHING.

41:49.360 --> 41:52.921
YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE
THAT MUCH TO BE ANGRY ABOUT.

41:52.930 --> 41:55.592
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.921
YEAH, AND I'M NOT
REALLY SURE I WANT TO,

41:57.930 --> 42:00.524
CONSIDERING HOW YOU LIKE
TO SHIT ALL OVER EVERYTHING.

42:02.860 --> 42:04.225
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

42:04.230 --> 42:06.050
I FULLY SUPPORT
YOUR LITTLE DESIRE

42:06.060 --> 42:08.358
TO HAVE SOME LIFE
YOU'D SEE ON NICKELODEON,

42:08.360 --> 42:11.818
BUT I DON'T SUPPORT
YOU BEING A JUDGMENTAL DICK.

42:16.030 --> 42:17.588
MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST GO.

42:17.600 --> 42:20.125
MAYBE.

42:21.560 --> 42:23.653
OKAY, MERRY CHRISTMAS.

42:23.660 --> 42:25.855
WHATEVER.

42:32.330 --> 42:36.426
I'M GLAD I COULD SPEND
ONE LAST CHRISTMAS WITH JESSE.

42:38.230 --> 42:41.051
HE WAS A CRAZY SONOFABITCH,
BUT I SURE LOVED HIM.

42:41.060 --> 42:44.120
I CAN TELL.

42:45.530 --> 42:47.293
GOD, DID HE KNOW
HOW TO LIVE.

42:47.300 --> 42:49.052
IT WAS FULL-THROTTLE
ALL THE WAY.

42:51.130 --> 42:54.691
WE MET IN STURGIS,
BACK IN '78.

42:54.700 --> 42:57.089
I WAS SITTING
AT THE BROKEN SPOKE

42:57.100 --> 42:59.898
WITH THE BIGGEST
BAD-ASS IN TOWN,

42:59.900 --> 43:01.856
BUT JESSE...

43:03.130 --> 43:05.121
HE HAD
SOME BALLS ON HIM.

43:05.130 --> 43:07.325
HE WALKED
RIGHT UP TO ME.

43:07.330 --> 43:09.525
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT,
AND HE SAID,

43:09.530 --> 43:12.624
"IF I DON'T ASK YOU
TO TAKE A RIDE WITH ME,

43:12.630 --> 43:14.791
I'LL REGRET IT
THE REST OF MY LIFE."

43:14.800 --> 43:19.089
AND THAT RIDE
LASTED 23 YEARS.

43:21.060 --> 43:22.755
HE ALWAYS SAID,

43:22.760 --> 43:25.649
HIS TWO FAVORITE THINGS WERE
RIDING HIS HOG AND RIDING ME.

43:25.660 --> 43:29.596
AND HE TREATED US
BOTH LIKE QUEENS.

43:31.660 --> 43:34.720
YOU'RE PROBABLY WISHING HE
TREATED HIMSELF AS CAREFULLY.

43:34.730 --> 43:38.325
OH, HONEY, IT JUST
WASN'T IN HIS BLOOD.

43:39.800 --> 43:42.598
IF HE WERE A CAREFUL MAN,
HE MIGHT HAVE LIVED LONGER,

43:42.600 --> 43:43.851
BUT...

43:45.600 --> 43:48.524
WOULD HE HAVE ENJOYED
HIS LIFE AS MUCH ?

43:48.530 --> 43:52.648
WOULD I HAVE ENJOYED
HIS LIFE AS MUCH ?

43:57.100 --> 44:00.228
I HAD A BIKE
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

44:00.230 --> 44:02.926
HAD IT FOR ABOUT A WEEK
BEFORE I WIPED OUT,

44:02.930 --> 44:05.455
JUST FUCKED
IT UP ROYALLY.

44:05.460 --> 44:06.950
( laughing )

44:06.960 --> 44:09.053
I STILL HAVE A PIN
IN MY FOOT.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.991
I NEVER GOT BACK
ON A BIKE AFTER THAT.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.649
I COULD NEVER
GIVE IT UP.

44:14.660 --> 44:15.991
NO WAY.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.492
CLOSEST THING TO FLYING
WITHOUT LEAVING THE GROUND.

44:22.460 --> 44:24.951
SOMETIMES I FOOL MYSELF
INTO THINKING

44:24.960 --> 44:27.326
I LIVE MY LIFE
TO THE FULLEST.

44:27.330 --> 44:29.753
BUT COMPARED TO YOU AND JESSE,
I THINK I'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.352
HONEY...

44:31.360 --> 44:34.557
IF I WERE A FEW YEARS YOUNGER,
I'D BE WILLING TO TEACH YOU.

44:34.560 --> 44:37.199
WELL, I JUST
MIGHT LET YOU.

44:41.130 --> 44:43.098
JESSE ALWAYS SAID

44:43.100 --> 44:45.694
YOU GOTTA LIVE EVERY DAY
LIKE YOU MIGHT DIE TOMORROW.

44:45.700 --> 44:47.622
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT ?

44:47.630 --> 44:50.121
YOU JUST MIGHT.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.049
( laughing )

45:36.660 --> 45:39.549
( giggling )

45:46.260 --> 45:48.125
HERE'S A GLASS
OF WATER.

45:48.130 --> 45:50.155
I COULDN'T
FIND A BELL,

45:50.160 --> 45:52.151
SO, IF YOU NEED ME
DURING THE NIGHT,

45:52.160 --> 45:53.627
JUST YELL VERY LOUDLY.

45:53.630 --> 45:55.325
I WILL BE FINE.

45:55.330 --> 45:57.855
DID YOU CALL THE POLICE YET
TO FILE A REPORT ?

45:57.860 --> 46:01.489
NO, I WILL
DO THAT LATER.

46:05.230 --> 46:06.993
I'LL PUT THIS
WHERE YOU CAN REACH IT.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.093
I DON'T LIKE FOR YOU
TO DO THIS.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.658
DON'T BE SILLY.

46:10.660 --> 46:12.548
YOU HAVE
TWO BROKEN LEGS

46:12.560 --> 46:14.619
AND YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

46:14.630 --> 46:18.657
AND I'M HAPPY TO DO IT,
SO STOP MAKING A FUSS.

46:20.530 --> 46:22.555
WHAT ?

46:22.560 --> 46:25.358
NOTHING.

46:25.360 --> 46:27.954
WHAT I TOLD YOU BEFORE.

46:27.960 --> 46:31.054
THAT YOU ARE
BEAUTIFUL.

46:32.430 --> 46:34.295
OH, STOP IT.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.422
NATHANIEL.

47:12.430 --> 47:14.819
I HAD THE SWIRL
IN THE DIP JUST RIGHT.

47:14.830 --> 47:16.525
JUST ONE FOR THE ROAD.

47:16.530 --> 47:18.498
THE AIRPORT TRAFFIC'S
GONNA BE MURDER.

47:18.500 --> 47:19.728
THEN YOU SHOULD
GET GOING.

47:19.730 --> 47:20.594
ALRIGHT.

47:52.760 --> 47:52.828
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO STAY UP

47:54.160 --> 47:55.991
AND PLAY WITH WHAT
SANTA CLAUS BROUGHT ME.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.456
GIVE IT UP, TAYLOR.

47:57.460 --> 48:00.099
I COULD MAKE YOU GUYS A CUPCAKE
WITH MY EASY BAKE OVEN.

48:00.100 --> 48:03.149
HE'S A COP,
HE DOESN'T TAKE BRIBES.

48:05.630 --> 48:07.222
MERRY CHRISTMAS, BABY !

48:07.230 --> 48:09.027
MAMA !

48:09.030 --> 48:11.999
I DROVE ALL DAY LONG
JUST SO I COULD BE HERE.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.695
THAT'S HOW MUCH
YOUR MAMA LOVES YOU.

48:13.700 --> 48:16.260
I LOVE YOU,
TOO, MAMA.

48:16.260 --> 48:18.228
I KNEW YOU'D COME.

48:21.500 --> 48:23.889
BILLY DIDN'T CALL
OR E-MAIL ME ALL DAY.

48:23.900 --> 48:25.697
SO?

48:25.700 --> 48:29.625
SO, YOU KNOW,
IT'S CHRISTMAS.

48:30.230 --> 48:33.393
YOU DIDN'T EXACTLY
GIVE HIM THE WARMEST
OF GREETINGS LAST NIGHT.

48:33.400 --> 48:34.697
BUT THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

48:34.700 --> 48:36.725
IF HE HAD WRITTEN ME,
TOLD ME HE WAS GONNA BE THERE,

48:36.730 --> 48:39.290
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FREAKED OUT
BY THE WHOLE THING.

48:39.300 --> 48:41.256
WELL, DO YOU EVER CALL
OR E-MAIL HIM ?

48:41.260 --> 48:45.321
YEAH, I E-MAILED HIM
IN THE HOSPITAL LAST SUMMER,

48:45.330 --> 48:48.322
BUT HE NEVER
WROTE BACK, SO...

48:52.100 --> 48:54.022
HE E-MAILS CLAIRE
ALL THE TIME.

48:54.900 --> 48:55.992
WHAT ?

48:56.000 --> 48:57.399
YEAH.

48:57.400 --> 48:58.458
EVEN WHILE
WE WERE THERE,

48:58.460 --> 49:00.758
SHE WAS RUNNING OFF
TO CHECK HER MAIL.

49:04.100 --> 49:06.853
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WHEN DID THIS START ?

49:06.860 --> 49:08.396
HEY, DID YOU BRING HOME
ANY OF THAT REINDEER CAKE ?

49:08.400 --> 49:09.697
I ASKED YOU
A QUESTION.

49:09.700 --> 49:11.395
I DON'T KNOW.

49:11.400 --> 49:12.799
SHE JUST
TOLD ME TONIGHT.

49:12.800 --> 49:15.724
WELL, I DON'T WANT BILLY HAVING
ANYTHING TO DO WITH CLAIRE,

49:15.730 --> 49:16.924
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME ?

49:16.930 --> 49:18.124
WHY NOT ?

49:18.130 --> 49:19.620
YOU SAID
THAT HE WAS OKAY.

49:19.630 --> 49:22.997
YEAH, HE'S OKAY ENOUGH TO WALK
DOWN THE STREET WITHOUT A LEASH,

49:23.000 --> 49:25.195
BUT HE'S NOT OKAY ENOUGH
TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR MY SISTER,

49:25.200 --> 49:28.692
WHO WE BOTH KNOW
HAS THIS FUCKED UP ATTRACTION
TO SOCIOPATHS.

49:28.700 --> 49:30.099
LOOK, DON'T TELL ME--

49:30.100 --> 49:31.226
I AM TELLING YOU !

49:31.230 --> 49:33.152
HE IS YOUR BROTHER,
YOU KEEP HIM AWAY.

49:33.160 --> 49:35.219
AND IF YOU DON'T,
I SWEAR TO GOD, I WILL !

49:35.230 --> 49:36.629
YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, NATE ?

49:36.630 --> 49:38.495
YOU'RE GONNA
CHALLENGE HIM TO A DUEL,

49:38.500 --> 49:39.524
YOU GONNA--

49:39.530 --> 49:41.020
BRENDA, WOULD YOU
KNOCK IT THE FUCK OFF ?!

49:41.030 --> 49:42.054
WHY DON'T YOU--

49:42.060 --> 49:44.221
HEY, WOULD YOU
FUCKING LISTEN TO ME !

49:44.230 --> 49:46.653
WILL YOU
SHUT THE FUCK UP ?!

49:47.660 --> 49:48.854
FUCK !

49:48.860 --> 49:50.623
HEY.

49:52.030 --> 49:54.897
HEY, HEY, HEY.

49:54.900 --> 49:57.095
IT'S OKAY.

49:58.060 --> 49:59.459
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

49:59.460 --> 50:02.657
IT'S OKAY,
IT'S ALRIGHT.

50:04.530 --> 50:06.555
( sobbing )

50:14.830 --> 50:18.027
( groaning )

50:32.430 --> 50:33.988
OH, SHIT.

50:34.000 --> 50:34.989
YEAH ?

50:35.000 --> 50:37.252
OH, SHIT, I THINK I'M,
SHIT, I'M SHIT,

50:37.260 --> 50:39.319
I'M HAVING ANOTHER SHIT,
ANOTHER I'M SHIT--

50:39.330 --> 50:41.195
NATE ?!

50:41.200 --> 50:42.952
NATE !

50:42.960 --> 50:45.019
NATE, LOOK AT ME.

50:45.030 --> 50:47.419
NATE, LOOK AT ME !

50:47.430 --> 50:49.250
GET OFF !
NATE !

50:49.260 --> 50:51.694
GET THE FUCK OFF,
I'M FINE !

51:00.500 --> 51:01.489
NATE...

51:01.500 --> 51:04.719
IT'S OKAY,
IT'S OKAY.

51:06.500 --> 51:09.298
WHAT WAS THAT ?

51:11.100 --> 51:12.829
FUCK.

51:16.900 --> 51:19.095
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
TAKING FOR IT ?

51:19.100 --> 51:20.897
DILANTIN.

51:20.900 --> 51:23.551
IT'S AN ANTIEPILEPTIC.

51:23.560 --> 51:25.391
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO CONTROL THE SEIZURES.

51:25.400 --> 51:28.358
AND I THOUGHT IT DID
UNTIL TONIGHT.

51:28.360 --> 51:30.396
I'LL TALK
TO YOUR DOCTOR.

51:30.400 --> 51:33.221
MAYBE WE CAN SWITCH YOU
TO SOMETHING STRONGER.

51:34.630 --> 51:37.895
DON'T WORRY, I WON'T LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.451
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THIS ?

51:48.560 --> 51:50.858
I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE A BURDEN.

51:52.460 --> 51:54.394
OH.

51:54.400 --> 51:56.288
YOU'LL NEVER
BE A BURDEN.

52:06.200 --> 52:07.553
OH, GOOD MORNING.

52:07.560 --> 52:09.096
HI.

52:10.600 --> 52:13.057
MARILYN JOHNSON
LEFT THAT FOR YOU.

52:16.460 --> 52:18.951
SHE HAD A BELT BUCKLE
WITH A BIG SKULL ON IT.

52:18.960 --> 52:22.088
I THOUGHT
THAT WAS ODD.

52:28.400 --> 52:31.324
( Blue Oyster Cult playing )

52:40.960 --> 52:44.657
ALL OUR TIMES
HAVE COME

52:47.530 --> 52:51.626
HERE BUT NOW
THEY'RE GONE

52:54.200 --> 52:56.828
SEASONS DON'T FEAR
THE REAPER

52:56.830 --> 53:00.027
NOR DO THE WIND,
THE SUN, OR THE RAIN

53:00.030 --> 53:01.554
WE CAN BE LIKE
THEY ARE

53:01.560 --> 53:05.394
C'MON, BABY,
DON'T FEAR THE REAPER

53:05.400 --> 53:08.449
BABY, TAKE MY HAN D,
DON'T FEAR THE REAPER

53:08.460 --> 53:12.157
WE'LL BE ABLE TO FLY,
DON'T FEAR THE REAPER

53:12.160 --> 53:16.028
BABY, I'M YOUR MAN...

53:16.030 --> 53:20.023
