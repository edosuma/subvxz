01:12.472 --> 01:14.274
Whoo!

01:14.340 --> 01:15.675
What's up, home cooks?

01:16.943 --> 01:19.279
Jennifer, Katie, Shant.

01:19.345 --> 01:21.347
Welcome to <i>Cook at all Costs.</i>
You guys ready?

01:21.414 --> 01:22.649
Yes.

01:23.183 --> 01:26.252
So, perhaps you haven't noticed,
but there's no pantry for you.

01:27.487 --> 01:28.321
Yeah.

01:28.388 --> 01:31.424
Instead, you're gonna have to buy
all of your ingredients

01:31.491 --> 01:34.761
using your bank of $25,000.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.463
-Let's go.
-Wow.

01:36.529 --> 01:38.765
-Let's go, baby.
-Ooh! All right.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.701
In this first challenge, you'll be making
a dish in any way you like,

01:41.768 --> 01:44.904
using ingredients that are being prepared
in our back pantry

01:44.971 --> 01:47.340
by our guest chef and judge.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.776
You may know her
from Netflix's <i>Barbecue Showdown,</i>

01:49.843 --> 01:54.581
seven-time World Barbecue Champion,
owner of Memphis Barbecue Company,

01:55.315 --> 01:56.950
Chef Melissa Cookston.

01:57.016 --> 01:58.017
Oh, my goodness!

01:59.185 --> 02:04.257
Chef Melissa is a barbecue icon.
Super intimidating.

02:04.991 --> 02:08.161
Chef Melissa is prepping
three different ingredient boxes for you.

02:08.228 --> 02:11.731
And with that being said,
Chef, send out those boxes.

02:16.402 --> 02:17.504
Oh my gosh.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.141
-Wow.
-I'm freaking out.

02:21.708 --> 02:24.477
You'll start by secretly bidding
on the three ingredient boxes

02:24.544 --> 02:28.348
in front of you,
using your bank of $25,000.

02:28.915 --> 02:31.017
The cook that bids highest
gets the Spend Box,

02:31.084 --> 02:32.819
which has top-of-the-line ingredients,

02:32.886 --> 02:35.188
sure to elevate your dish to new heights.

02:35.255 --> 02:36.256
Okay.

02:36.756 --> 02:38.391
The lowest bidder gets the Save Box.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.026
It has ordinary ingredients

02:40.093 --> 02:43.263
that you can transform
into extraordinary dishes.

02:44.264 --> 02:46.900
And the cook with the middle bid
gets the Surprise Box.

02:46.966 --> 02:49.202
It's got, well, surprise ingredients

02:49.269 --> 02:51.571
meant to keep you on your toes.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.440
Keep in mind, the winning cook

02:54.507 --> 02:56.943
walks away with whatever cash
is left in their bank.

02:58.077 --> 03:00.313
-Dope.
-Go ahead and lock in your bids now.

03:03.883 --> 03:06.352
I don't want
to go crazy with the money,

03:06.419 --> 03:08.021
but I also believe that you gotta

03:08.087 --> 03:11.157
put a little risk out there
in order to get what you really need.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.527
I want to walk out of here
with a fair amount of money.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.262
So I'm going for that Save Box

03:16.329 --> 03:20.400
because I know I could make amazing food
with the humblest ingredients.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.304
Jennifer, let's take a look
at your bid.

03:24.837 --> 03:26.739
$2,700. Shant.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.943
$2,501.

03:30.009 --> 03:31.744
Someone's going low.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.379
Katie.

03:33.446 --> 03:35.181
$2,501.

03:35.248 --> 03:36.749
-Ah!
-Oh.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.586
Shant and Katie,
you both bid the same amount,

03:39.652 --> 03:40.520
2,501,

03:40.587 --> 03:43.923
but, Katie, you entered your bid first,

03:43.990 --> 03:46.726
which means you get
your pick of Save or Surprise.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.495
Let's go with the Surprise.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.930
Oh! Adventurous.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.232
-Why not?
-Okay.

03:52.298 --> 03:53.299
Wow.

03:53.933 --> 03:57.804
I picked Surprise because I'm ready
for the unpredictable.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.240
And Shant, you get the Save Box.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.576
That means, Jennifer,
you got the Spend Box.

04:03.643 --> 04:04.477
Great.

04:05.578 --> 04:09.182
You have 45 minutes
to make your best out-of-the-box dish

04:09.249 --> 04:10.583
in any style you want.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.620
And watch out, because more ingredients
will be coming down the line

04:13.686 --> 04:15.822
that Chef Cookston is preparing for you

04:15.888 --> 04:17.824
to have the opportunity to bid on.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.994
Jennifer, Shant, Katie,

04:21.060 --> 04:22.895
are you ready to cook at all costs?

04:22.962 --> 04:24.397
-Yes!
-Great.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.432
Because your time starts now!

04:28.968 --> 04:30.003
They're heavy. Watch out.

04:30.069 --> 04:31.371
-Right behind you.
-Oh, okay.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.778
Ground chicken, sherry wine,

04:38.845 --> 04:40.647
green pigeon peas…

04:40.713 --> 04:42.015
So I open my Save Box,

04:42.081 --> 04:43.449
and I have ground chicken,

04:43.516 --> 04:45.785
canned beans, sour cream,

04:45.852 --> 04:46.986
sherry cooking wine,

04:47.053 --> 04:48.154
and cremini mushrooms.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.523
What am I going to make?

04:51.724 --> 04:54.427
I have zero spices to work with,

04:54.494 --> 04:58.665
and ground chicken
doesn't really scream "flavor."

05:01.534 --> 05:03.002
Cognac, okay.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.004
Got some type of mushrooms,

05:05.071 --> 05:06.439
spatchcock chicken,

05:06.506 --> 05:08.041
speaking my language here.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.108
I got the Spend Box.

05:09.175 --> 05:11.377
There's cinnamon top mushrooms,

05:11.444 --> 05:13.079
mustard seeds, banana sauce,

05:13.146 --> 05:14.981
and spatchcock chicken.

05:15.515 --> 05:18.217
I don't regret
the Spend Box choice at all.

05:18.284 --> 05:19.686
Okay, that is my friend.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.754
Shant and Katie are shopping at outlets.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.323
I'm over here on Rodeo Drive.

05:24.290 --> 05:27.860
Apple brandy, pineapple cooking sauce.

05:27.927 --> 05:30.930
I am so excited
for the Surprise Box.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.031
I'm up for the challenge.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.533
There's some apple brandy,

05:33.599 --> 05:34.600
hot sauce,

05:34.667 --> 05:36.636
Greek yogurt, radicchio.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.839
Chicken hearts!

05:41.040 --> 05:43.443
What do I do with chicken hearts?

05:44.444 --> 05:46.646
I have never cooked
with chicken hearts before.

05:46.713 --> 05:50.650
I've never even eaten
or seen a chicken heart before.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.585
Oh, my gosh.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.322
Okay, boxes are open.

05:56.389 --> 05:59.058
The Spend Box,
we have a spatchcock chicken,

05:59.125 --> 06:02.895
which has its backbone removed
and is flattened. I like that.

06:02.962 --> 06:05.298
Save Box, we have ground chicken.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.999
That is truly saving, there.

06:07.066 --> 06:09.969
And surprise, surprise,
we have some chicken hearts.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.505
-Offal meats, often overlooked.

06:12.572 --> 06:13.773
Chicken hearts, eh?

06:13.840 --> 06:16.943
-What are you gonna do with those?
-I have never even seen a chicken heart!

06:17.009 --> 06:18.811
-I don't know what I'm gonna do.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.947
-Gonna learn today.
-Oh, my gosh.

06:21.013 --> 06:25.485
There is a teeny, tiny moment
of regret with the Surprise Box,

06:25.551 --> 06:29.122
but I'm a mom
to three beautiful, busy little girls.

06:29.188 --> 06:31.324
So I'm in the kitchen all day.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.727
These chicken hearts
are gonna be showed who's boss.

06:34.794 --> 06:38.030
I'm going to coat the chicken hearts here
with some flour, salt, and pepper,

06:38.097 --> 06:40.133
and then I'm gonna fry them up
here on the stove.

06:40.199 --> 06:44.270
I'm going to start making
a fresh lettuce wrap using the radicchio.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.038
Keep it fresh and keep it light.

06:46.105 --> 06:49.142
I'll be surprising myself if it works out.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.377
Don't know
what this tastes like.

06:51.444 --> 06:54.147
I taste the red sauce,
and it's really spicy,

06:54.213 --> 06:56.048
but it's got a hint of sweet to it.

06:56.115 --> 06:59.986
So I'm thinking I'm gonna throw that
into some type of marinade for my chicken.

07:00.052 --> 07:02.955
Banana sauce, some mushrooms here.

07:03.022 --> 07:05.024
I make crazy sauces all the time.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.294
I'm cooking five to six nights a week
for my very big family.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.763
I do have five children,
uh, two left at home.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.331
My twin boys are 13,

07:12.398 --> 07:14.567
and they eat everything all the time.

07:14.634 --> 07:18.137
And so,
I have to be just, like, on it.

07:19.338 --> 07:20.506
That's actually good.

07:21.307 --> 07:22.942
-Hey, Jennifer!
-Hey, what's up?

07:23.009 --> 07:25.678
You got spatchcock chicken, huh?
You know, it's gonna take some time.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.513
-It's got bone in it.
-I know.

07:27.580 --> 07:31.884
Spatchcock chicken takes the one thing
I don't have in this instance, time.

07:36.155 --> 07:39.692
All right.
Chef Melissa, those boxes are crazy.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.461
-Yes.
-The Surprise Box.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.930
-You put chicken hearts in there?
-Yes.

07:43.996 --> 07:46.499
Now, I mean, how would
you approach making that?

07:46.566 --> 07:48.968
Honey, I'm from the South.
We batter and fry everything.

07:49.035 --> 07:51.804
-But especially hearts and livers.
-Mm-hmm, of course.

07:51.871 --> 07:55.241
And the Spend Box, spatchcock chicken, oh!

07:55.308 --> 07:56.142
I would grill that.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.511
Cooks so much faster
when you spatchcock it

07:58.578 --> 07:59.979
and you get so much flavor.

08:00.046 --> 08:03.316
Especially because it has
so much of that flatter surface area,

08:03.382 --> 08:05.485
you really get more crispy skin,
I find, that way.

08:05.551 --> 08:07.753
-You do.
-And then on the Save Box…

08:07.820 --> 08:09.188
How do you expect a home cook

08:09.255 --> 08:11.891
to elevate ground chicken
and turn it into a winning dish?

08:11.958 --> 08:14.827
I think-- I would think
something savory, something creamy.

08:14.894 --> 08:18.364
-And overall, what are you looking for?
-Texture and flavor.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.366
-Of course.
-My two big things.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.567
But don't lose your head.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.936
Yeah. Right, Chef,
I'm gonna go look in on the home cooks.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.172
Send out the upgrades
whenever you're ready.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.277
Still don't know exactly
what I'm going to make, but…

08:31.777 --> 08:33.112
hopefully it'll come together.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.580
I'm a newlywed.

08:34.647 --> 08:37.383
My husband and I have been married
for five months,

08:37.450 --> 08:40.386
and we're really looking forward
to taking the honeymoon.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.990
So when I win today,
we're going to be going all out.

08:44.056 --> 08:45.725
Do you guys like your boxes?

08:45.791 --> 08:48.194
Um, I'll let you know
in about ten minutes.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.696
-Once I figure out what I'm doing with it.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.300
Kind of freaking out a little bit
because the time's running out,

08:54.367 --> 08:55.935
and I still have no idea

08:56.002 --> 08:58.738
what I'm gonna be making
with that ground chicken.

08:58.804 --> 09:02.708
But I'm Lebanese-Armenian.
I get beans, I'm gonna make hummus.

09:02.775 --> 09:04.710
I can make hummus with my eyes closed,

09:04.777 --> 09:07.680
and one arm tied behind my back,
jumping on one leg.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.085
Yeah. Okay, I can deal with that.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.321
You can never have too much hot sauce.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.558
I really want a spicy hit
in my lettuce wraps.

09:18.624 --> 09:21.327
So I'm blending together the Greek yogurt

09:21.394 --> 09:23.796
and that amazing hot sauce,

09:23.863 --> 09:27.700
but I need something
to elevate my dish and get me the win.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.975
Uh-oh. What's that?

09:36.042 --> 09:38.811
Home cooks, are you ready
for your first auction?

09:38.878 --> 09:40.413
-Sure.
-Let's do it.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.651
First item up for auction is…

09:46.485 --> 09:47.720
onions.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.221
One of the most versatile vegetables.

09:49.288 --> 09:51.891
I love these,
'cause they can be sweet when cooked

09:51.958 --> 09:53.192
and punchy when raw.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.561
I need these onions.

09:55.628 --> 09:58.698
They're the perfect side
to go with these lettuce wraps.

09:58.764 --> 10:02.802
Because onions are so important,
I'm going to set the bidding at $500.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.470
-Yes.
-Do I have $600?

10:04.537 --> 10:06.072
-Going up seven.

10:06.138 --> 10:06.973
-$700.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.474
-Do I have eight?

10:08.541 --> 10:09.642
-Do I hear nine?
-I need it.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.711
-Do I have 1,000?

10:11.777 --> 10:12.878
Do I have $1,200?

10:13.913 --> 10:14.747
Do I have 1,500?

10:16.015 --> 10:17.450
Do I have 1,800?

10:17.516 --> 10:19.418
-Oh my goodness.
-$1,500 going once…

10:19.485 --> 10:22.021
$1,500, going twice…

10:22.088 --> 10:23.155
Sold to Katie.

10:23.222 --> 10:24.557
That is $600 an onion.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.158
That's some pricey onions.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.298
Okay, next item up for auction is…

10:32.365 --> 10:34.000
rice paper wrappers.

10:34.066 --> 10:36.969
Are you guys trying to get fancy?
Make some nice little spring rolls.

10:37.036 --> 10:39.372
Whether they're fried or fresh,
always delicious,

10:39.438 --> 10:41.407
especially when we're talking
with chicken.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.010
That is what
I'm missing in this box.

10:44.076 --> 10:45.778
Soon as I see those rice paper wraps,

10:45.845 --> 10:48.514
I know that I can make
a cohesive dish now.

10:48.581 --> 10:51.550
I'm gonna start the auction off at $500.

10:51.617 --> 10:53.686
-500!
-$500 to Shant.

10:53.753 --> 10:54.987
Do I have 600?

10:55.054 --> 10:58.524
500 going once. $500 going twice.

10:58.591 --> 11:01.827
Sold to Shant. Rice papers, $500.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.263
-That's rice and water, everyone.
-$500.

11:04.764 --> 11:08.467
Total game changer.
Finally, everything makes sense.

11:08.534 --> 11:09.769
Now, it's a party.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.772
I'm going to be making chicken wrappers

11:12.838 --> 11:14.173
with, uh-- with the rice paper.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.775
So kind of like summer rolls.

11:15.841 --> 11:21.781
I'm making chicken and pickled mushroom
summer roll with pigeon bean hummus.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.717
Middle Eastern meets Vietnamese.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.585
Let's call it a fusion dish.

11:26.652 --> 11:30.089
The pressure is so on right now.
I don't know where the time is going.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.892
Twenty minutes. Time is ticking away.

11:32.958 --> 11:36.062
I'm just getting my onions prepped here
for some onion rings.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.830
I'm getting them battered,

11:37.897 --> 11:40.066
and then they'll be
into the fryer here really quick.

11:40.132 --> 11:43.169
I'm making onion rings
for a little bit of crispy.

11:43.235 --> 11:44.970
And honestly, who doesn't love
an onion ring?

11:45.838 --> 11:49.241
And then I'm also going
to sauté these onions with mushrooms

11:49.308 --> 11:51.977
for a sweet hit in my lettuce wraps.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.785
Uh-oh. I hear something coming.

11:59.852 --> 12:02.688
Looks like we got
a surprise auction coming through.

12:02.755 --> 12:03.989
-What?
-All right!

12:04.056 --> 12:05.124
I'm ready.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.695
This next item up for auction
is a whole head of garlic.

12:09.762 --> 12:13.599
It can be intense, it can be spicy,
it can be mellow, it can be sweet.

12:13.666 --> 12:17.369
I think some garlic
would just take the spatchcock chicken

12:17.436 --> 12:21.040
completely over the top.
So the garlic is mine.

12:21.107 --> 12:24.944
Could be yours
for the starting price of $1,000.

12:25.010 --> 12:27.113
-Do I have $1,500?

12:27.179 --> 12:28.714
You're not outbidding me on this, dude.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.216
-Come on!
-1,000 going once.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.218
-It's too late!
-Don't do me like that.

12:32.284 --> 12:34.053
-1,000 going twice.
-Don't do me like that.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.488
-Sold! To Jennifer.

12:35.554 --> 12:36.889
-Nope, sold. Jennifer.

12:36.956 --> 12:39.892
$1,000 for a clove of garlic.

12:39.959 --> 12:43.195
-Only on <i>Cook at all Costs,</i> baby. $1,000.
-Yeah, baby.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.331
The most expensive garlic
in the world.

12:45.397 --> 12:47.399
Now that I have my garlic, I'm set.

12:47.466 --> 12:49.001
I know the sauce will be okay.

12:49.068 --> 12:52.271
This is all I needed. I'm actually going
to throw this into the sauce.

12:52.338 --> 12:55.441
I'm going to take the chicken out,
smother my chicken with my sauce,

12:55.508 --> 12:58.544
then I'm gonna throw it back on the grill
and braise it until it's done.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.478
There we go.

13:01.113 --> 13:04.550
Five minutes left. Hurry up!
This is it, finish your plates.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.819
Hey, have you guys ever done
chicken hearts before?

13:06.886 --> 13:08.554
Yup, they don't take that long to cook.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.855
All right, thank you.

13:09.922 --> 13:12.291
I'm so nervous about those chicken hearts.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.226
I have no idea if I cooked them right.

13:18.097 --> 13:21.367
Rice paper wrappers
are very complicated to use.

13:21.433 --> 13:25.070
The second you let them
get a little too soft,

13:25.137 --> 13:26.272
you gotta start over.

13:26.338 --> 13:28.808
Aww, this isn't happening right now.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.510
Because you're not gonna
be able to roll them,

13:31.577 --> 13:35.381
and they're just gonna break apart on you.
But I think it came out really perfectly.

13:35.447 --> 13:36.282
Nice.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.287
One minute left, home cooks.
One minute.

13:41.353 --> 13:43.055
-I am so concerned.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.557
I'm down to the wire,

13:44.623 --> 13:47.593
and I'm not quite sure
if the chicken is cooked all the way,

13:47.660 --> 13:49.395
but I need to get it on a plate.

13:49.461 --> 13:50.529
Oh, my gosh.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.165
Thirty seconds.

13:53.232 --> 13:56.335
You need to put your plates on the line.

13:56.402 --> 13:58.270
Hit the red button before time runs out.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.406
All right, you guys.
Let's bring it on home.

14:00.472 --> 14:01.307
Let's do this!

14:02.408 --> 14:04.343
Oh, my goodness.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.880
Ten, nine, eight, seven…

14:07.947 --> 14:10.916
-…six, five, four…

14:10.983 --> 14:14.220
-…three, two, one.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.988
Good job, home cooks.

14:16.055 --> 14:17.957
Oh, my God.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.658
Oh, my gosh.

14:20.326 --> 14:21.493
Bye-bye, food.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.830
I hope Chef Cookston recognizes
the amount of technique

14:24.897 --> 14:26.866
that went into making this dish.

14:26.932 --> 14:28.801
I feel as though I did
the best that I could

14:28.868 --> 14:30.636
with the ingredients that I have.

14:32.104 --> 14:33.239
Oof!

14:33.305 --> 14:35.507
-Chef Melissa, that was intense.

14:35.574 --> 14:36.542
All right.

14:36.609 --> 14:37.910
I can't wait to dig in.

14:37.977 --> 14:40.813
Okay, Melissa.
This is a chicken heart lettuce wrap

14:40.880 --> 14:43.182
with a spicy Greek yogurt used as a sauce,

14:43.249 --> 14:45.084
and crispy fried onion rings.

14:50.522 --> 14:54.226
Fun fact, this home cook
has never cooked chicken hearts before.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.097
With chicken hearts, you have
to be careful 'cause they can be so tough.

14:58.163 --> 15:01.433
These are a really good texture,
they're nice and sultry.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.969
And I love this sauce in here.

15:04.036 --> 15:06.906
I'm getting savory, I'm getting sweet,
I'm getting a little acidic,

15:06.972 --> 15:10.409
and I really like these crunchy
little onion rings they have over here.

15:10.476 --> 15:14.146
I might have showcased
the mushrooms on top a little better.

15:14.213 --> 15:17.516
It's a little soggy, just because
everything's sitting on top of each other.

15:18.183 --> 15:21.420
But all in all, I think it's, uh--
It's a pretty good dish.

15:23.155 --> 15:24.623
Chef Melissa, ready for the next one?

15:24.690 --> 15:25.824
Absolutely.

15:25.891 --> 15:27.192
Let's go.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.729
This dish is a chicken
and pickled mushroom summer roll

15:30.796 --> 15:32.431
with a pigeon pea hummus.

15:37.136 --> 15:40.105
The pigeon peas made a beautiful hummus.

15:40.172 --> 15:42.107
The textures of the chicken are very good,

15:42.975 --> 15:46.145
but I'm not getting much
of a flavor profile.

15:46.211 --> 15:49.782
I get a little bit of sweet
but don't get any salt,

15:49.848 --> 15:51.483
any acidic, any heat.

15:51.550 --> 15:55.387
All I got was just a touch
of sweet and then flat.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.490
Salt and pepper can go such a long way
when used in the right amounts.

15:58.557 --> 15:59.391
Right.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.593
The home cook purchased
the rice wrapper here.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.796
Do you think it was a poor investment?

16:03.862 --> 16:07.366
The creativity of a summer roll was great!

16:07.433 --> 16:08.968
-Mm-hmm.
-I love the idea.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.336
It is very refreshing,

16:10.402 --> 16:14.006
but I think maybe the execution of it
was just a little bit of lackluster.

16:14.073 --> 16:14.907
Got it.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.744
Okay, Melissa, ready for the next dish?

16:18.811 --> 16:19.812
I am.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.146
All righty.

16:21.213 --> 16:23.716
This is a grilled spatchcock chicken

16:23.782 --> 16:26.185
with a cinnamon mushroom cap salad.

16:26.251 --> 16:28.454
Obviously,
somebody knew I was here

16:28.520 --> 16:29.855
'cause they threw it on the grill,

16:29.922 --> 16:31.957
and they know
I love a little kiss of fire.

16:35.227 --> 16:39.231
So, this home cook was worried
that they wouldn't get a full cook.

16:39.298 --> 16:40.566
So how did they do there?

16:40.632 --> 16:43.469
This piece is a little bit undercooked.

16:43.535 --> 16:46.638
Just a hair. On that piece,
they did a fantastic job.

16:47.206 --> 16:48.073
Ah, okay.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.076
And it's moist.
It's juicy, perfectly cooked.

16:51.143 --> 16:54.680
This cook purchased
one single head of garlic

16:54.747 --> 16:56.281
for $1,000.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.951
This kind of reminds me
of an Alabama white sauce.

16:59.018 --> 16:59.852
Ah, I see.

16:59.918 --> 17:02.488
It's very garlic heavy,
and it's very good.

17:02.554 --> 17:03.989
It's fantastic.

17:05.791 --> 17:08.427
-So, Chef, do we have a round-one winner?
-I think I do.

17:08.494 --> 17:09.661
Okay, I'll go let them know.

17:13.899 --> 17:14.867
It's result time.

17:16.201 --> 17:20.739
The home cook
with the best out-of-the-box dish is…

17:25.244 --> 17:26.745
-Katie.

17:26.812 --> 17:28.113
-Oh!

17:30.015 --> 17:32.351
What?! I am shocked.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.586
Chicken hearts! I just can't believe it.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.256
First time cooking chicken hearts?
You lie!

17:39.158 --> 17:40.125
Home cooks,

17:40.192 --> 17:42.895
it's time to turn up the heat
for your final challenge,

17:42.961 --> 17:46.999
and it's inspired by Chef Melissa
in the best possible way.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.501
Since she's a seven-time
world barbecue champ,

17:49.568 --> 17:52.638
your final challenge is Backyard Barbecue.

17:52.704 --> 17:54.573
-Ah, yes!
-Hey!

17:54.640 --> 17:56.875
You'll be using ingredients
that are being prepared

17:56.942 --> 17:58.844
by our guest chef and judge

17:58.911 --> 18:01.447
that'll help you make
your best barbecue dish.

18:02.014 --> 18:05.751
Chef Melissa
is the barbecue master!

18:05.818 --> 18:07.753
This is really intimidating.

18:08.353 --> 18:11.290
All right, Chef.
Send out those ingredient boxes.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.963
In this round,
the boxes have set prices.

18:19.131 --> 18:21.533
The Spend Box is $8,000,

18:21.600 --> 18:24.503
the Save Box will cost you $4,000,

18:24.570 --> 18:27.573
and the Surprise Box will cost you $6,000.

18:28.173 --> 18:31.310
Katie, by winning the first round,
you've earned the power

18:31.376 --> 18:34.146
to assign each of the ingredient boxes
to the other home cooks.

18:36.748 --> 18:37.683
Oh, my gosh.

18:37.749 --> 18:39.118
Price tag included.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.519
Oh, my gosh.

18:40.586 --> 18:43.589
With that being said, Katie, which box
would you like to buy for yourself?

18:43.655 --> 18:47.426
I think that the Surprise Box
served me well in the first round,

18:47.493 --> 18:48.627
so I'm gonna take it again.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.829
-Ooh, I like that. Okay.
-Yeah. Let's do it.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.764
Okay, Katie,
you bought the Surprise Box

18:52.831 --> 18:54.733
and that'll cost you $6,000.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.735
-Now, for the fun part.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.239
Hey, Katie, who would you like
to assign the Spend Box to?

19:00.305 --> 19:01.206
Oh!

19:02.541 --> 19:07.279
I think because Jennifer had
the Spend Box first,

19:07.346 --> 19:10.983
I'm going to give you
the Spend Box this time, Shant.

19:11.783 --> 19:13.652
I am a Type A personality.

19:13.719 --> 19:16.989
I do not enjoy
other people spending my money for me.

19:17.055 --> 19:19.124
I can do that myself, thank you very much.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.426
Which means, Jennifer,
you've got the Save Box.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.361
Yes.

19:23.929 --> 19:27.299
Home cooks, watch out for more upgrades
coming down the line throughout the cook.

19:27.366 --> 19:31.170
And as a reminder,
the cook with the best barbecue dish

19:31.236 --> 19:33.839
will win all the money
that's left in their bank.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.142
You have 60 minutes on the clock,

19:37.209 --> 19:38.944
and the time has come again

19:39.011 --> 19:41.847
to cook at all costs. Go!

19:46.685 --> 19:48.387
Oh, yes, please.

19:48.453 --> 19:49.955
I open my Spend Box.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.623
I saw the Vidalia onions,

19:51.690 --> 19:53.759
bourbon, the Worcestershire sauce,

19:53.825 --> 19:55.027
and the ketchup.

19:55.093 --> 19:56.995
I got the start
of a nice barbecue sauce here.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.798
Holy!

19:59.865 --> 20:01.733
Look how thick these things are!

20:01.800 --> 20:05.671
These "pork chops"
are the size of my head,

20:05.737 --> 20:10.242
but as soon as I see these ingredients,
I know I can make a winning dish.

20:10.309 --> 20:11.443
Okay.

20:12.177 --> 20:15.681
Tomatoes, dried apricots,

20:15.747 --> 20:18.350
cabbage, beans.

20:19.051 --> 20:19.985
Tofu?!

20:20.052 --> 20:21.286
What'd you get, Katie?

20:22.487 --> 20:25.190
I got two blocks of firm tofu.

20:25.257 --> 20:26.892
Oh, lovely.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.328
I take it back. I want that box!

20:29.394 --> 20:34.166
Shant has this dinosaur-sized pork chop
that's made for barbecuing.

20:34.967 --> 20:35.801
And I have tofu.

20:35.867 --> 20:39.771
I'm having serious doubts
about choosing this Surprise Box.

20:39.838 --> 20:40.806
Surprise!

20:42.741 --> 20:45.677
Barbecue at Jenn's house is super chill.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.913
You got music. You have great food.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.915
I love to throw a good barbecue.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.049
Let's do it.

20:51.116 --> 20:52.451
So, I open the Save Box,

20:52.517 --> 20:54.453
and I've got shredded cabbage,

20:54.519 --> 20:56.088
broad beans, pickle juice.

20:56.154 --> 20:58.824
Yes, I got my steak.

20:58.890 --> 21:00.092
Flank steak.

21:00.158 --> 21:03.061
That is a staple in my house,
something I cook regularly.

21:03.128 --> 21:03.962
Yeah, baby.

21:04.029 --> 21:07.266
I'm marinating
the flank steak in the root beer,

21:07.332 --> 21:10.602
some of the pickle juice,
and salt, and sugar, and pepper.

21:10.669 --> 21:13.872
I'm gonna let it marinate as long as I can
and throw it right on the grill.

21:14.439 --> 21:19.244
All right, so the proteins are out.
I see flank steak from the Save Box,

21:19.311 --> 21:22.180
porterhouse pork chops in the Spend Box,

21:22.247 --> 21:25.250
and the protein
for the Surprise is firm tofu.

21:25.317 --> 21:26.151
Yep.

21:26.218 --> 21:28.186
What's a barbecue without a protein?

21:28.253 --> 21:30.522
So, I have to use this tofu.

21:30.589 --> 21:33.325
We're gonna have
some barbecued tofu today.

21:33.892 --> 21:37.029
I'm just literally gonna treat them
like little mini steaks.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.230
With this tofu,

21:38.297 --> 21:41.166
gonna use the red cabbage
and the raspberry vinaigrette

21:41.233 --> 21:42.234
for a coleslaw,

21:42.301 --> 21:45.103
and I think I'm gonna add in
those dried apricots.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.606
And then, I'm also gonna make baked beans.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.808
It is what it is.
We're going to go for it.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.877
That's a lot of damn pork, man.

21:51.943 --> 21:54.146
All right. I need to breathe.

21:54.212 --> 21:57.282
Right away, I know I need
to do something pretty dramatic

21:57.349 --> 21:59.418
to these porterhouse pork chops,

21:59.484 --> 22:01.887
because they're just not gonna cook
in the time that I have.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.589
Sorry, pork chop, I'm cutting you up.

22:05.157 --> 22:09.795
As a Lebanese-Armenian,
barbecue in my home is kabobs.

22:09.861 --> 22:14.166
So I'm making
bourbon pineapple pork kabobs

22:14.232 --> 22:15.834
on warm potato salad.

22:15.901 --> 22:18.370
I want this pork bursting with flavor,

22:18.437 --> 22:22.607
so I'm making a marinade
with raw onions and Worcestershire sauce,

22:22.674 --> 22:25.344
and bourbon, and ketchup.

22:25.410 --> 22:30.749
And I'm going to just let that sit
in the marinade for as long as I can.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.684
Perfect, yes!

22:34.920 --> 22:37.022
Melissa, do I smell spices?

22:37.089 --> 22:38.890
-Oh, yes.
-Are we getting spicy?

22:38.957 --> 22:41.827
-We are getting hot.
-What are you working on?

22:42.394 --> 22:45.497
These are spices
that would make a great barbecue rub.

22:45.564 --> 22:46.998
-Nice.
-Garlic powder.

22:47.065 --> 22:50.736
Celery salt, smoked paprika,
and mustard powder.

22:50.802 --> 22:52.738
I will say, I saw those boxes open,

22:52.804 --> 22:54.973
and I'm like, "All right,
where's the barbecue come in?"

22:55.040 --> 22:56.274
And now this makes sense.

22:56.341 --> 22:58.143
-Absolutely.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.312
All right, Chef Melissa,
now talking about the boxes.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.647
Spend Box has pretty much
everything you'd want,

23:02.714 --> 23:05.050
and then I-- I noticed in the Save Box,

23:05.117 --> 23:06.985
there's pickle brine,
pickle juice in there.

23:07.052 --> 23:10.956
Well, you know,
some of the best protein I've ever had

23:11.022 --> 23:12.691
had a quick marinade with pickle juice.

23:12.758 --> 23:16.228
Yes! The acidity is going
to help tenderize that flank steak.

23:16.294 --> 23:18.497
Right, Chef, I look forward
to seeing what you send out.

23:21.299 --> 23:23.135
I don't know
if that'll be firm enough.

23:23.201 --> 23:26.071
-Name of the game's barbecue.
-I know!

23:26.138 --> 23:29.040
Grill marks are so important on this tofu.

23:29.107 --> 23:30.909
It's the essence of barbecue.

23:30.976 --> 23:33.545
Oh, no. It's sticking to my grill.

23:34.379 --> 23:38.183
This tofu
is just falling to pieces on me.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.153
The tofu is lost in the grill.

23:41.219 --> 23:42.954
There is no coming back.

23:43.021 --> 23:45.390
This is total tofu carnage!

23:48.693 --> 23:50.695
I am super happy about this.

23:50.762 --> 23:54.866
I want to bring the essence
of barbecue at Jenn's house to this dish,

23:54.933 --> 23:57.436
and you cannot have a backyard barbecue

23:57.502 --> 24:00.172
without a side of slaw and baked beans.

24:00.238 --> 24:03.074
For my slaw, I'm doing
something a little different.

24:03.141 --> 24:05.477
I'm actually putting
the pickle juice in there.

24:05.544 --> 24:08.113
It adds a little bit of that sour taste,

24:08.180 --> 24:10.215
and I think it'll go
really good with the meat.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.351
And then with my broad beans, I have
the tomato paste and the minced onions.

24:13.418 --> 24:15.420
This is so amazing.

24:15.487 --> 24:18.457
But I'm definitely missing
some seasonings right now.

24:18.523 --> 24:21.626
Are we going
to actually get spices this time?

24:24.963 --> 24:27.532
-Something's happening.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.635
Home cooks, you know what that sound is.

24:31.670 --> 24:34.573
Wait a minute. Let me get
my buzzer fingers ready.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.374
These are my buzzer fingers.

24:36.441 --> 24:38.310
See that? See that? It's quick.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.880
All right, home cooks,
first item up for auction…

24:41.947 --> 24:45.383
It's chicken drumsticks.

24:45.450 --> 24:48.186
Chicken drumsticks,
a decent protein!

24:48.253 --> 24:51.590
I'll start the bidding
for chicken at $1,200.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.892
-$1,200 going once.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.160
$1,200 going twice.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.561
Sold to Katie!

24:56.628 --> 24:59.664
-Whoo! Thank you, thank you, thank you.
-Drumsticks, $1,200.

24:59.731 --> 25:03.635
Now that I have this chicken, the tofu,
I'm ready to kick it to the curb.

25:04.202 --> 25:07.839
All right. Second item up
for bid is a flavor balancer,

25:07.906 --> 25:11.276
and it's going to add some lightness
to your dish. Asparagus.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.613
I only have beans and slaw.
I need this asparagus.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.381
I'll start it low. $800.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.617
-$800 to Jennifer.

25:18.683 --> 25:21.953
$800 going once. $800 going twice.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.589
-Sold! To Jennifer for $800.
-Yeah.

25:25.557 --> 25:28.493
All right, now this one,
if you're cooking barbecue,

25:28.560 --> 25:30.695
you have to have some barbecue spices--

25:30.762 --> 25:31.630
-Come on.
-…up in here.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.031
-Ooh!
-All right, come on!

25:33.098 --> 25:35.500
-Mustard powder, Spanish paprika--
-Please, yes!

25:35.567 --> 25:37.135
-…celery salt, and garlic powder.
-Yes!

25:37.202 --> 25:38.637
-Yes! How much you want?
-Yes.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.973
Just to spice things up, this is a buy-in,
which means there's enough for all of you.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.710
One of these little stacks
is going to cost you $1,500.

25:45.777 --> 25:48.146
-Ooh!
-Buzz in to buy in.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.548
-1,500-- There you go!

25:49.614 --> 25:51.182
-Go, grab it, 15!
-Come on.

25:51.249 --> 25:52.984
You can grab it. 1,500 for Shant.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.619
-1,500 for Jennifer.
-Yes!

25:54.686 --> 25:56.454
-1,500 for Katie. Go ahead.
-Yes!

25:59.157 --> 26:01.159
Oh my gosh, I feel so much better.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.762
These spices are a staple.

26:03.828 --> 26:07.165
They carry over into everything
from your meats to your sides.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.368
I'm going to add
a little paprika to smoke this up.

26:10.435 --> 26:12.237
I'm really excited about the asparagus.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.940
I'm going to throw it in the oven
and broil it really quick.

26:15.006 --> 26:16.741
Leave that in there for a while.

26:16.808 --> 26:19.744
Now, it's time to get
my flank steak on the grill.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.483
'Bout to start smelling
real good in here, y'all.

26:25.550 --> 26:26.751
All right!

26:26.818 --> 26:31.489
Now that I have spices, I feel
like my dish is way more barbecue.

26:31.556 --> 26:33.792
I'm going to bake those,

26:33.858 --> 26:35.927
and then I'm gonna finish them off
on the grill.

26:35.994 --> 26:38.263
But I know that they need barbecue sauce.

26:38.330 --> 26:41.366
So I'm just going to toss
my cherry tomatoes in this blender.

26:41.967 --> 26:46.504
I need some sugar,
vinegar, all those spices.

26:46.571 --> 26:48.607
So I'm going to boil this
and let it reduce.

26:50.241 --> 26:53.178
My sauce is good,
but it's missing that kick.

26:54.145 --> 26:56.448
-Home cooks. Uh-oh.

26:56.514 --> 26:59.250
Here comes another upgrade.
Get those buzzers ready.

27:00.652 --> 27:01.553
What could this be?

27:02.621 --> 27:03.855
Well, let's have a look.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.024
-Ooh!
-What?

27:06.091 --> 27:07.892
-A gold spoon.
-What?

27:07.959 --> 27:10.095
This spoon represents
a very valuable upgrade.

27:10.161 --> 27:11.296
The cook with the highest bid

27:11.363 --> 27:14.733
gets to send a taste of what you're making
back to the winningest woman in barbecue,

27:14.799 --> 27:17.535
Chef Melissa,
and she'll offer a helpful hint.

27:17.602 --> 27:20.905
-And maybe even an extra ingredient.

27:20.972 --> 27:24.709
That's why I'm gonna open the bidding up
for this Golden Spoon at $1,500.

27:24.776 --> 27:25.777
Oh, my gosh.

27:25.844 --> 27:27.145
How much help do you need?

27:27.212 --> 27:28.980
This is a total game changer.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.383
-Whatever. It's just money.
-Okay!

27:31.449 --> 27:33.151
$1,500 going once.

27:33.218 --> 27:35.654
-$1,500 going twice.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.389
Sold to Katie!

27:38.123 --> 27:40.025
Okay, Katie. Give me
a tester to send back.

27:40.091 --> 27:41.192
I'll walk it over myself.

27:41.259 --> 27:43.528
Okay, I think I'm gonna send
back the sauce I've started.

27:43.595 --> 27:45.463
-Okay.
-Tell her I'm trying my best.

27:45.530 --> 27:47.198
-I will. I'll be right back.
-Okay.

27:47.966 --> 27:51.836
To get feedback from Melissa,
that's priceless.

27:52.637 --> 27:54.506
Okay, Chef Melissa.

27:54.572 --> 27:56.207
This is from one of the home cooks.

27:56.708 --> 27:59.644
This is their barbecue sauce,
and they need some help. So, please.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.820
The flavor is good,
but I think it needs something

28:08.887 --> 28:11.222
to give it a balance of texture.

28:11.289 --> 28:14.125
-Mm-hmm.
-And a little smoothness.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.027
-Okay.
-I have just the thing.

28:16.094 --> 28:17.429
Oh, okay!

28:19.631 --> 28:21.166
-So…
-Okay.

28:21.232 --> 28:24.736
-She says it needs… hot honey. All right?
-Yeah, definitely.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.705
-Thank you.
-And then she says smooth it out more.

28:26.771 --> 28:27.806
-Smooth it out.
-Got it?

28:27.872 --> 28:29.474
-Cool. Good luck.
-Yeah. Thank you.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.309
I'm adding
the hot honey to my sauce,

28:31.376 --> 28:33.511
which is going to be
on my barbecue chicken.

28:33.578 --> 28:35.246
I'm just finishing up my chicken here.

28:35.313 --> 28:37.682
I wanna get one more coat
of the barbecue sauce on it.

28:39.484 --> 28:41.486
I just want this to cook nice.

28:42.287 --> 28:43.822
Pork is very finicky.

28:43.888 --> 28:47.225
The least you can have it cooked
is a medium-well.

28:47.292 --> 28:49.794
So a tiny bit of pink inside is okay.

28:50.829 --> 28:51.863
Still not cooked.

28:52.964 --> 28:54.365
It is not cooked yet.

28:55.366 --> 28:56.835
Five minutes left.

28:57.502 --> 29:00.505
So I need to leave this on the grill
as long as possible.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.308
I'm gonna need every last minute
I can on these ones.

29:03.374 --> 29:08.012
I'm thinking to myself, "There's no way
I'm going to finish this dish in time."

29:10.548 --> 29:11.716
Moment of truth.

29:11.783 --> 29:18.423
I spent $6,300 on my barbecue dish.

29:18.490 --> 29:21.860
I'm really trying to figure out
how I'm gonna creatively plate this.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.463
Coleslaw and then meat
is the biggest part.

29:25.530 --> 29:28.533
This could absolutely be a winning dish.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.137
Mmm! Sauce turned out really nice.

29:32.203 --> 29:34.973
My revamped barbecue sauce, it's smoky,

29:35.039 --> 29:38.109
and then at the end,
it's got that wonderful hit of hot honey.

29:38.176 --> 29:40.311
Right to the last minute.

29:40.378 --> 29:44.516
I left my pork on the grill
until the last possible second.

29:44.582 --> 29:46.451
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

29:46.518 --> 29:49.387
This pork
better be cooked properly.

29:50.688 --> 29:53.758
-Ten, nine, eight…
-Whoo!

29:53.825 --> 29:56.795
-…seven, six, five…

29:56.861 --> 29:59.764
-…four, three, two…

29:59.831 --> 30:01.199
-…one.

30:01.266 --> 30:02.867
Whoo!

30:02.934 --> 30:03.935
Hot damn, y'all.

30:04.002 --> 30:05.503
-Whoo!
-Dude.

30:12.777 --> 30:15.079
-Wow! That was super fun.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.514
Well, that's barbecue, fun.

30:16.581 --> 30:18.983
It is. It really is.
Okay, let's do it.

30:19.050 --> 30:22.587
First up, you have spicy barbecue chicken

30:22.654 --> 30:25.089
with sweet slaw and home-style beans.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.592
-And this is obviously the Surprise Box.
-Yes.

30:27.659 --> 30:31.029
-Hmm. I don't see the tofu.
-No tofu.

30:31.095 --> 30:33.865
So obviously, they upgraded
to the chicken drums.

30:35.066 --> 30:38.036
Barbecue tofu,
it's tough to get that umami in,

30:38.102 --> 30:40.205
that flavor and that hominess into it.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.309
This is good barbecue.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.978
-Wow! That's high praise.
-This is good barbecue.

30:47.045 --> 30:49.647
And then this sauce is sassy just like me.

30:49.714 --> 30:53.751
Oh, well, that's good,
because this home cook took your advice.

30:54.252 --> 30:56.855
-And used the hot honey.
-Oh, I think it's gorgeous sauce.

30:59.557 --> 31:01.693
-That was a really good coleslaw.
-Wow.

31:01.759 --> 31:04.495
But the kidney beans
really don't work for baked beans.

31:04.562 --> 31:06.464
-Kidney beans are very strong.
-Mm-hmm.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.933
That's really the only flavor
that comes through in the beans.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.069
So, chicken is the star of the show.

31:13.805 --> 31:15.373
Chef Melissa, ready for the next dish?

31:15.440 --> 31:16.307
Yes, sir.

31:16.374 --> 31:20.411
Okay. In front of you,
you have a bourbon-pineapple pork kabob

31:20.478 --> 31:22.080
over a warm potato salad.

31:22.847 --> 31:26.150
This home cook had beautiful
porterhouse pork chops.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.952
Do you think a kabob
was the right play there?

31:28.019 --> 31:31.623
When you kabob them, it's hard
to maintain an internal temperature

31:31.689 --> 31:33.391
that's consistent all the way across.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.059
-Of course.
-That's my main concern.

31:38.363 --> 31:41.833
Love the flavor of the pork,
and, uh, the pork is so tender.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.469
The sauce was very good as well.

31:44.535 --> 31:47.605
It complements the pork
instead of overpowering the pork,

31:47.672 --> 31:50.174
and I taste the spice buy-in,

31:50.241 --> 31:51.676
but I'm just not picking up

31:51.743 --> 31:54.412
a whole lot of seasoning
in the potato salad.

31:56.981 --> 31:58.650
-Are you ready for the next?
-I am.

31:58.716 --> 31:59.984
All right.

32:00.051 --> 32:02.120
This is a root beer-marinated flank steak

32:02.186 --> 32:05.256
with pickle juice coleslaw
and baked beans.

32:05.890 --> 32:07.358
Okay, so this slaw…

32:09.661 --> 32:13.498
This pickle juice-based coleslaw,
first time I've ever had it.

32:13.564 --> 32:14.432
Pretty good.

32:14.499 --> 32:17.302
-A check on the ingenuity right there.
-Yeah, creativity.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.406
The beans have multiple textures going on,
which I kind of like.

32:21.472 --> 32:25.977
And I see that they upgraded
and bought some asparagus.

32:29.080 --> 32:32.350
It is some good asparagus,
and let's check out this flank steak.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.288
It's very tender,
but I'm not really tasting seasoning.

32:37.355 --> 32:41.893
I don't think they made
the most of the spice buy-in.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.728
-Mm-hmm.
-Just need a little bit more flavor.

32:45.296 --> 32:48.766
Chef Melissa, you've sampled
all of these dishes.

32:48.833 --> 32:51.602
Do you think you have
a barbecue champion of your own?

32:51.669 --> 32:52.937
I do.

32:55.039 --> 32:57.442
All right,
time to win some money.

32:58.543 --> 33:01.846
Home cooks, it's time to find out
who smoked the competition

33:01.913 --> 33:04.048
and is walking away with all the money

33:04.115 --> 33:05.683
remaining in their bank.

33:05.750 --> 33:09.687
But first, let me introduce you
to our guest chef and judge,

33:09.754 --> 33:13.224
the one and only Chef Melissa Cookston.

33:13.291 --> 33:14.792
-Nice.
-Oh!

33:14.859 --> 33:16.461
-Hey.
-Oh, my gosh!

33:19.364 --> 33:20.999
-Hello, home cooks.
-Hi.

33:21.065 --> 33:22.000
-Hello.
-Hi!

33:22.066 --> 33:23.835
Okay, let's get to the results.

33:27.138 --> 33:30.375
Which home cook
made the spicy barbecue chicken?

33:30.441 --> 33:31.275
I did.

33:31.342 --> 33:34.645
So the chicken drumstick
was grilled to perfection,

33:34.712 --> 33:37.582
and your sauce was nice and smoky.

33:37.648 --> 33:39.417
But you could've done more with the beans.

33:39.484 --> 33:40.351
Yeah.

33:40.418 --> 33:43.621
Who made the bourbon-pineapple
pork kabobs?

33:43.688 --> 33:48.026
Your pork kabob was tender,
but the potato salad was underseasoned.

33:48.793 --> 33:52.497
And, Jennifer, I assume
you made the flank steak and slaw.

33:52.563 --> 33:57.301
-Yes.
-Your coleslaw was the star of your plate.

33:57.368 --> 34:00.071
But the flank steak
should've been the star.

34:01.172 --> 34:06.010
Katie, you have $10,799
remaining in your bank.

34:06.511 --> 34:10.048
Shant, you have $12,499.

34:10.114 --> 34:12.683
And Jennifer, you have the largest amount,

34:12.750 --> 34:15.553
with $15,000 remaining in your bank.

34:15.620 --> 34:19.524
Now it's time to find out who is truly
the backyard barbecue champion.

34:20.491 --> 34:24.462
The home cook with the best dish is…

34:27.932 --> 34:29.067
Katie.

34:29.133 --> 34:31.536
-Katie!

34:33.871 --> 34:35.673
Let it out, girl! You did it!

34:35.740 --> 34:37.408
-Good job, Katie.
-How does it feel?

34:37.475 --> 34:39.444
-Really good.
-Where's the emotion coming from?

34:39.510 --> 34:42.380
I'm just really excited
to tell my girls when I get home.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.715
-Yes! I love that.

34:44.782 --> 34:48.352
So excited,
to not just tell my little girls,

34:48.419 --> 34:52.457
but to be able to show them
that they can chase their wildest dreams.

34:52.523 --> 34:54.459
Katie, it's not easy

34:54.525 --> 34:56.494
to take very difficult ingredients

34:56.561 --> 34:58.563
and make something wonderful out of them,

34:58.629 --> 34:59.664
and you did that.

34:59.730 --> 35:05.103
Well, Katie, congratulations
because you've now won $10,799.

35:05.169 --> 35:08.239
-You've proved you can cook at all costs.

35:08.306 --> 35:09.207
Good job.

35:09.273 --> 35:10.374
Thank you.

35:11.375 --> 35:15.279
I gave it everything that I had,
and that, I can't put a price on.

35:15.346 --> 35:16.814
And not just that,

35:16.881 --> 35:19.917
but to have a barbecue champion
taste my food.

35:19.984 --> 35:21.185
You know what?

35:21.252 --> 35:22.353
I'm proud of myself.

35:23.020 --> 35:27.391
I am 100% proud
of the dish that I served.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.027
I feel so accomplished.

35:31.162 --> 35:35.233
I'm taking home the knowledge
that I can take those humble ingredients,

35:35.299 --> 35:38.269
put a twist on them,
and elevate them to something unexpected.
