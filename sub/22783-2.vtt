LEMONIS:
Tonight on "The Profit"...

00:02.703 --> 00:03.569
Is this my tiny home?

00:03.604 --> 00:06.739
A Colorado manufacturer
of tiny homes

00:06.774 --> 00:09.074
has dreams of building
an empire.

00:09.110 --> 00:12.144
The quality of workmanship
is unbelievable.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.680
But the owner's finding out
that the big business

00:14.715 --> 00:17.583
of little living is more
than he bargained for.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.518
I want to help you be a better
C.E.O..

00:19.553 --> 00:23.122
'Cause right now, you're a
nice man and a terrible C.E.O.

00:23.157 --> 00:26.025
He's put the business in
over a million dollars of debt.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.793
Do the people that work here
know how bad it is?

00:27.828 --> 00:28.861
STEVE:
The top managers do.

00:28.896 --> 00:29.728
The rest don't.

00:29.764 --> 00:30.796
BERNADETTE: It puts
a lot of pressure.

00:30.831 --> 00:34.266
LEMONIS: His lack of leadership
has killed morale.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.869
STEVE: I avoid conflict
and I have not done a good job

00:36.904 --> 00:38.370
at holding
people accountable.

00:38.406 --> 00:41.006
LEMONIS: If I can't get him
to change his mind-set...

00:41.042 --> 00:42.708
This doesn't even,
like, faze you.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.109
That freaks me out.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.712
...and fix the foundation
of his company...

00:46.747 --> 00:49.114
TRACY: These people are here
because they care.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.983
LEMONIS: ...the entire
Tumbleweed business

00:51.018 --> 00:52.184
will collapse.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.386
Do you know what
"fercockt" means?

00:54.422 --> 00:56.889
My name is
Marcus Lemonis,

00:56.924 --> 01:00.392
and I risk my own money
to save struggling businesses.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.794
We're not gonna
wake up every morning

01:01.829 --> 01:03.162
wondering if
we have a job.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.629
We're gonna wake up
every morning

01:04.665 --> 01:06.398
wondering how many jobs
we have to do.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.333
It's not always pretty.

01:08.369 --> 01:11.003
Everything's gonna change.
Everything.

01:11.038 --> 01:14.706
But I do it to save jobs,
and I do it to make money.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.175
This...
Let's go to work.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.576
...is "The Profit."

01:17.611 --> 01:20.646
♪♪

01:23.617 --> 01:26.185
In 2012, Steve Weissmann
took over

01:26.220 --> 01:28.053
Tumbleweed
Tiny House Company...

01:28.089 --> 01:28.987
STEVE:
How are sales going?

01:29.023 --> 01:31.190
LEMONIS: ...now America's
top manufacturer

01:31.225 --> 01:32.891
of mobile tiny homes.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.661
TRACY: This is our
Roanoke model.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.263
LEMONIS: He had little
experience building homes.

01:38.299 --> 01:41.266
Still, he managed to grow
the company from five people

01:41.302 --> 01:43.602
working out of a garage
to 70 people

01:43.637 --> 01:46.505
working out of a
20,000-square-foot facility.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.373
TRACY: We have hundreds and
hundreds of floor plans.

01:48.409 --> 01:53.045
LEMONIS: And today, sales exceed
$6 million per year.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.714
However,
as the company has grown,

01:55.749 --> 01:57.616
so have the
operating costs.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.751
TRACY: If I do not get
my windows ordered,

01:59.787 --> 02:01.420
it is gonna
really kill us.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.256
LEMONIS: Desperate to keep
the lights on and expand,

02:04.291 --> 02:08.060
Steve turned to unconventional
loans and credit cards.

02:08.095 --> 02:11.363
Now, with over $1 million
of debt,

02:11.398 --> 02:14.032
Tumbleweed is on the verge
of bankruptcy.

02:14.068 --> 02:18.604
STEVE: The company
is in jeopardy.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.739
LEMONIS: With my ownership
in Camping World,

02:20.774 --> 02:24.243
I've been in the RV space
for over a decade,

02:24.278 --> 02:27.045
and I feel that investing
in Tumbleweed would allow me

02:27.081 --> 02:30.415
to make a huge splash
in the tiny-home market.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.553
PAT: Yes, sir.
How may I assist you today?

02:34.588 --> 02:36.488
LEMONIS: Hi, there.
PAT: Welcome to Tumbleweed.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.589
LEMONIS: How are you?
I'm Marcus.

02:37.625 --> 02:38.957
PAT: Oh, Marcus.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.159
So wonderful
to meet you.

02:40.194 --> 02:40.959
LEMONIS: Nice to meet you.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.761
STEVE: Hey.
LEMONIS: I'm Marcus.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.329
STEVE: I'm Steve.
LEMONIS: Steve,
nice to meet you.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.165
STEVE: Nice to meet you.
It's so surreal, actually,

02:46.200 --> 02:47.966
meeting you face-to-face.
LEMONIS: We're here.
Let's do it.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.169
So, this is your business.
STEVE: This is it.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.837
LEMONIS: What prompted you
to get into this?

02:51.872 --> 02:53.172
STEVE: I'm a minimalist
by trade.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.106
LEMONIS: Do you live
in a tiny home?

02:54.141 --> 02:55.474
STEVE: No. I live in
a regular house now.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.408
I've got a family
and kids.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.977
I actually live in Sonoma
and in Colorado.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.246
LEMONIS: What happened to,
"I want to be a minimalist"?

03:01.282 --> 03:02.581
STEVE: I still am
a minimalist.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.616
LEMONIS: Yeah.
What did you do before this?

03:04.652 --> 03:05.751
STEVE: I was
a restaurateur.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.253
I really don't have much
experience in manufacturing.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.022
I can manufacture
a burger.

03:10.057 --> 03:10.789
LEMONIS: Okay.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.324
Can you show me
a few models?

03:12.359 --> 03:15.928
STEVE: So, we have Cypress,
the Farallon Alta,

03:15.963 --> 03:18.830
the Elm 26 Equator,
and the Roanoke.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.032
LEMONIS: I mean,
it's like a log cabin.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.033
STEVE: Yeah.
LEMONIS: But it's movable.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.669
STEVE: Yes. They can pick
their floor finish,

03:23.704 --> 03:25.737
they can pick their roof
and window colors.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.373
People really want to get
into these and customize them.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.209
LEMONIS: So, what is your
typical price

03:30.244 --> 03:31.610
for an average unit
sold here?

03:31.645 --> 03:33.111
STEVE: Right now,
$80,000.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.947
LEMONIS: And what's
the maximum capacity

03:34.982 --> 03:36.715
that the factory
can actually produce?

03:36.750 --> 03:37.516
STEVE:
We're currently producing

03:37.551 --> 03:39.551
anywhere from eight to ten
a month.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.221
And we have about three
to four to five month backlog

03:42.256 --> 03:43.555
at any given time.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.224
LEMONIS: Three to five months?
STEVE: Yes.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.992
In the beginning,
when we started off,

03:47.027 --> 03:48.560
we were building
about two to three a month,

03:48.596 --> 03:50.529
and we started selling more,
and so our backlog grew

03:50.564 --> 03:52.364
and grew and grew and grew.
LEMONIS: Uh-huh.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.398
STEVE: Well, we're gonna go out
in the shop and take a look.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.466
LEMONIS: Well,
show me the shop.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.536
STEVE:
Yeah, all right.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.571
LEMONIS: What's fun
about tiny homes is that,

03:59.607 --> 04:03.041
although they're mobile, they
typically stay more stationary,

04:03.077 --> 04:05.377
and the craftsmanship
really matters.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.045
When I look at this
particular product

04:07.081 --> 04:08.747
and I look at the materials
that they use

04:08.782 --> 04:10.349
and the work that's
going into them,

04:10.384 --> 04:11.750
the work is
unparalleled.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.553
I have never seen anything
with this high of quality.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.887
Start to finish,
how long will it take?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.390
STEVE: It should
take 16 days.

04:18.425 --> 04:22.194
This one's probably gonna
take us 21, maybe 22.

04:22.229 --> 04:23.595
LEMONIS: Well,
how do you not know?

04:23.631 --> 04:24.963
STEVE: We're gonna know
when it's done.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.098
LEMONIS:
No, no, no, no.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.200
How are you pricing the unit
before you know how long

04:28.235 --> 04:29.268
it's gonna take?

04:29.303 --> 04:32.104
STEVE: We have a lot of
estimates on our pricing.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.339
People really want to
customize these a lot,

04:34.375 --> 04:36.375
so we get curveballs
all the time

04:36.410 --> 04:38.043
for things that we've
never done before.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.379
LEMONIS: Like?
STEVE: Like folding porches.

04:40.414 --> 04:43.882
We had no idea what that
was gonna entail.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.217
LEMONIS: What did it
cost you to make?

04:45.252 --> 04:46.518
Don't say you don't know.

04:46.553 --> 04:49.054
STEVE: Our costs of labor and
materials on one of these units

04:49.089 --> 04:49.888
is around 60%.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.757
LEMONIS: So,
your margins are 40%.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.558
STEVE: Well, okay, so,
besides the cost of goods,

04:53.594 --> 04:57.229
there's probably about 10%
additional costs in design,

04:57.264 --> 04:58.897
servicing, labor, sales.

04:58.932 --> 04:59.931
LEMONIS: So,
your margins are 30%.

04:59.967 --> 05:00.832
STEVE: 30%.

05:00.868 --> 05:01.833
LEMONIS: Do you think
those are good?

05:01.869 --> 05:02.901
STEVE: I don't know
if they're good or bad.

05:02.936 --> 05:06.204
LEMONIS: The more I dig,
the less I think he knows.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.740
I think any business owner's
lack of research

05:08.776 --> 05:11.643
will ultimately lead to
bad decision-making.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.145
You can't run
a business that way.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.946
What's up, guys?
BRIAN: Hello.

05:14.982 --> 05:15.814
LEMONIS: How are you?
BRIAN: Good.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.182
LEMONIS: I'm Marcus.
BRIAN: I'm Brian.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.283
LEMONIS: Nice to meet you,
Brian.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.018
MASON: Mason.
LEMONIS: Mason,
nice to meet you.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.153
Where did you learn
how to do this?

05:21.188 --> 05:23.488
BRIAN: Military.
LEMONIS: You were
in the military?

05:23.524 --> 05:25.057
BRIAN: Yeah.
LEMONIS: Thank you
for your service.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.191
BRIAN:
Thanks for your support.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.193
LEMONIS: I'm gonna put everybody
on the spot right now.

05:28.228 --> 05:31.663
If all the models that you guys
made were standard units,

05:31.699 --> 05:33.899
how much quicker would
the production process be?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.100
MASON: Significantly.
BRIAN: Yeah.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.268
LEMONIS:
Double the output?

05:36.303 --> 05:37.469
MASON: I would say so.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.704
LEMONIS: How are you doing, sir?
AUSTIN: I'm Austin Baker.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.604
LEMONIS: Hey, Austin.
AUSTIN: Production manager
out here.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.273
LEMONIS: How are you, sir?
AUSTIN: Great.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.140
LEMONIS: Nice to meet you.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.709
So, are you in charge
of the floor?

05:43.744 --> 05:45.444
AUSTIN: Yes, sir.
LEMONIS: You want to give me
a little tour, just you and I?

05:45.479 --> 05:48.113
AUSTIN: Please.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.682
So, I'm gonna show you the two
types of trailers we build on.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.584
We are fabricating
our frames right here.

05:52.619 --> 05:53.785
We're building them.
LEMONIS: You're not even
buying them?

05:53.821 --> 05:54.686
AUSTIN:
We're building them.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.455
Everything we can do,
we do in-house.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.191
We are so jammed,
and it's unnecessary.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.693
The word "custom" is sexy,
and it sells.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.328
LEMONIS: It also does
one other "S."

06:03.364 --> 06:05.364
AUSTIN: Ruins us.
LEMONIS: Slows things down.

06:05.399 --> 06:08.200
The real problem in this
production process

06:08.235 --> 06:12.037
is that the customization
slows things down.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.339
In Tumbleweed's current
manufacturing process,

06:14.375 --> 06:15.474
there are two distinct lines,

06:15.509 --> 06:18.810
meaning that only two homes
can be built at one time.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.379
And while they're being built,
they're done

06:20.414 --> 06:22.347
in four distinct stages.

06:22.383 --> 06:25.884
In stage 1, the trailer comes in
and the floor goes in.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.487
In stage 2, the walls
and the roof go in.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.390
In stage 3, the interior
starts to get put in.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.559
And in stage 4, that's where
they do the finishing touches.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.862
If there's one thing that needs
to change in the unit,

06:36.897 --> 06:39.197
it slows down
the entire line.

06:39.233 --> 06:42.367
When you've taken those ideas to
Steve, what does he say to you?

06:42.403 --> 06:43.902
AUSTIN: My ideas
were shut down.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.804
He doesn't understand
what we do out here, yet.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.038
He's a restaurant guy.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.407
LEMONIS: Has he ever worked
in the shop?

06:48.442 --> 06:49.641
AUSTIN: No,
and that's okay.

06:49.676 --> 06:50.809
That's not his job.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.644
That's what he
pays me to do.

06:52.679 --> 06:56.748
LEMONIS: I'm surprised that
Steve isn't immersing himself

06:56.784 --> 07:00.385
on the floor with the guys,
step-by-step, learning.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.220
"How do I improve it
by a day?"

07:02.256 --> 07:03.989
Not just to
make more money,

07:04.024 --> 07:06.558
but to help your people
be more successful.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.994
I-I don't know why
that's missing for him.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.229
AUSTIN: Marcus, I wanted
to introduce you to Lee.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.364
LEE: Hi, Marcus.
LEMONIS: Hi, Lee. How are you?

07:12.399 --> 07:13.899
LEE: Very nice to meet you.
LEMONIS: Nice to meet you.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.000
What do you do here, Lee?

07:15.035 --> 07:16.301
LEE: C.O.O.
LEMONIS: Okay.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.336
STEVE: Lee is brand-new. He's
been with us a week and a half.

07:18.372 --> 07:21.239
LEMONIS: And so, how does the
reporting structure work here?

07:21.275 --> 07:22.240
AUSTIN: So,
we have employee...

07:22.276 --> 07:24.009
LEMONIS: Yep, one.
AUSTIN: ...we have leads...

07:24.044 --> 07:25.744
LEMONIS: Two.
AUSTIN: ...we have
the foremen...

07:25.779 --> 07:27.112
LEMONIS: Three.
AUSTIN: ...we have the
production manager...

07:27.147 --> 07:28.046
LEMONIS: Four.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.948
AUSTIN: ...then, I have
Stephen Schlosser,

07:29.983 --> 07:31.450
who's the GM...
LEMONIS: Five.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.350
AUSTIN: ...then,
that's his boss...

07:32.386 --> 07:33.852
LEMONIS: Six.
AUSTIN: ...who's his boss.

07:33.887 --> 07:34.920
LEMONIS: Seven.
AUSTIN: Yeah.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.089
LEMONIS: So, seven layers
between you and the people

07:38.125 --> 07:40.058
that make the magic happen.
STEVE: Correct.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.226
LEMONIS: Does that seem like
a lot to you?

07:41.261 --> 07:42.360
STEVE: Yes, it does.

07:42.396 --> 07:43.361
LEMONIS: How about to you?

07:43.397 --> 07:44.463
LEE: No, it doesn't.

07:44.498 --> 07:47.065
The only redundancy that we
might have is Austin,

07:47.100 --> 07:50.035
because you have
general manager, foreman...

07:50.070 --> 07:51.069
the foreman's over
the two leads.

07:51.104 --> 07:54.406
LEMONIS: I was with you
up until shop foreman.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.908
The further we get away from
the work that, I get nervous.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.143
STEVE: Lee's like
flight control.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.110
Do we have
the parts we need?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.046
Which house is coming
into the line next?

08:01.081 --> 08:02.714
Are the plans complete?

08:02.749 --> 08:04.950
LEMONIS: Which is, normally,
in a small business,

08:04.985 --> 08:06.184
what the owner
would be doing.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.220
STEVE: So, I don't personally
think that I've got the time

08:08.255 --> 08:09.287
to do all that.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.490
LEMONIS: So, what are you
spending your time doing?

08:11.525 --> 08:14.326
STEVE: I do a lot of the
website, back-end work, as well.

08:14.361 --> 08:17.095
It's not a small job.
LEMONIS: Okay.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.897
It was kind of interesting
meeting Lee,

08:18.932 --> 08:20.899
because the things
that he is doing,

08:20.934 --> 08:22.901
I would expect
Steve to do.

08:22.936 --> 08:27.005
Steve is too separated from
what happens on the front lines.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.075
♪♪

08:30.110 --> 08:31.343
How are you?
TRACY: I'm Tracy.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.344
LEMONIS: Tracy,
nice to meet you.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.179
I just spent a little bit
of time with Austin.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.581
TRACY: My husband's name
is Austin, yes.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.816
LEMONIS: Oh, it's your husband.
TRACY: Uh-huh.

08:37.851 --> 08:38.984
LEMONIS: Okay.
TRACY: We've been married
almost 13 years?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.119
Something like that.
LEMONIS: I like him, by the way.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.687
TRACY: He's very passionate
about what he does.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.188
LEMONIS: Yeah.
TRACY: And his people out there.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.490
LEMONIS: So, could could you
take me through

08:45.526 --> 08:46.558
the sales process?

08:46.593 --> 08:48.493
Like, if I want to order
a certain type of floor...

08:48.529 --> 08:49.694
TRACY: So, you're
basically asking for

08:49.730 --> 08:51.363
a customization on this?
LEMONIS: Yes, can that be done?

08:51.398 --> 08:53.365
TRACY: If the production team
says we can do it,

08:53.400 --> 08:55.033
I'm not walking away
from the sale.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.836
LEMONIS: Why?
TRACY: So, we get 20%
of the cash up-front.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.006
LEMONIS: Uh-huh.
TRACY: If I don't have a lot
of cash customers for the month,

09:01.041 --> 09:02.974
those guys are struggling
for materials.

09:03.010 --> 09:07.312
LEMONIS: So, better said...
you say "yes" to anything,

09:07.347 --> 09:09.614
especially if they're
a cash buyer.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.649
TRACY: Yes.
LEMONIS: Okay.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.685
It's become clear to me
that every single unit

09:13.720 --> 09:17.055
that is bought from this company
has some nuance to it

09:17.090 --> 09:19.124
that is slowing down
the process.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.992
TRACY: This house, right here,
is a custom one.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.794
LEMONIS: I don't understand
how you're getting upstairs.

09:22.829 --> 09:24.062
AUSTIN: You'll never see this
in any other house.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.031
This was this lady...
LEMONIS: How do you
get up there?

09:26.066 --> 09:27.098
AUSTIN: She's gonna get her
little step-stool right here.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.834
LEMONIS: So, is there a
disconnect between sales,

09:29.870 --> 09:31.903
design, and what's happening
in the shop?

09:31.939 --> 09:33.905
AUSTIN: I can't blame sales,
because they have to make money.

09:33.941 --> 09:34.873
LEMONIS: I want to
ask you a question.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.875
Does Steve know what he's doing?
AUSTIN: No.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.543
LEMONIS: Does he know
how to manage people?

09:38.579 --> 09:40.211
AUSTIN: No.
LEMONIS: Does he know
how to design things?

09:40.247 --> 09:42.380
AUSTIN: No.
LEMONIS: Who's really
running this company?

09:42.416 --> 09:44.549
TRACY: He's running the outside,
and I'm running the inside.

09:44.585 --> 09:45.984
LEMONIS: Doesn't something
have to change?

09:46.019 --> 09:47.519
TRACY: Yeah.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.788
AUSTIN: If something doesn't
change, it won't happen.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.056
LEMONIS: Okay.
What's wrong?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.390
AUSTIN: So...
What's wrong?

09:52.426 --> 09:53.391
LEMONIS: Talk to us.
TRACY: Just that we love

09:53.427 --> 09:56.761
this place so much,
and we love those people.

09:56.797 --> 09:57.762
We do it
for these people.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.165
These people are here
because they care.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.733
They're not because
of the paycheck,

10:01.768 --> 10:03.101
I can promise you that.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.404
LEMONIS:
The idea of being in the
tiny-home business excites me.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.007
And after talking to Tracy and
Austin and seeing the folks

10:09.042 --> 10:12.877
on the factory floor, I mean,
there's a good recipe there.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.680
It just needs
some major tweaking.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.082
STEVE: Hi, Marcus.
I want to introduce you

10:17.117 --> 10:18.249
to my wife, Bernadette.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.584
LEMONIS: Bernadette,
how are you?

10:19.620 --> 10:20.485
BERNADETTE: Nice to
meet you, Marcus.
LEMONIS: Nice to meet you.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.753
BERNADETTE: Thank you
for being here.

10:21.788 --> 10:22.821
LEMONIS: I thought it may be a
good idea for the three of us

10:22.856 --> 10:25.857
to go outside and talk,
just, away from everybody.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.058
BERNADETTE: Yeah.
LEMONIS: Is that okay?

10:27.094 --> 10:28.760
Let's head out.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.894
You have kids?

10:29.930 --> 10:31.429
BERNADETTE: Two.
They're in there.

10:31.465 --> 10:32.697
LEMONIS: Oh, they are?
BERNADETTE: Yeah, stocked up
with snacks and games.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.698
LEMONIS: How old are they?

10:33.734 --> 10:34.633
BERNADETTE: 5 and 7.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.868
LEMONIS: What's the year
been like for you?

10:36.903 --> 10:38.703
BERNADETTE:
We've worked really hard,

10:38.739 --> 10:45.210
and I'd hate to see what
we've worked for, um, disappear.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.911
LEMONIS: He smiles a lot.
BERNADETTE: He does.

10:46.947 --> 10:50.048
LEMONIS: Is that a real smile,
or is that just for show?

10:50.083 --> 10:50.849
BERNADETTE:
It's a real smile.

10:50.884 --> 10:51.983
STEVE: I smile when I'm
stressed,

10:52.019 --> 10:54.452
I smile when I'm nervous,
and I smile when I'm happy.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.221
LEMONIS: Well, that's good.
STEVE: It's my default position.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.622
[ LAUGHS ]

10:57.658 --> 10:59.224
LEMONIS: How hard
has this been on him?

10:59.259 --> 11:01.626
BERNADETTE:
Incredibly difficult.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.262
A lot of
questioning himself.

11:04.297 --> 11:07.432
STEVE: I have taken a huge risk
just to get here today,

11:07.467 --> 11:09.501
and I've pushed myself
to the limit.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.670
LEMONIS: Do the people that
work here know how bad it is?

11:11.705 --> 11:14.072
STEVE: The top managers do.
The rest don't.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.907
LEMONIS: You know that it makes
me crazy that you have

11:15.942 --> 11:17.342
all these layers
of people, right?

11:17.377 --> 11:20.412
STEVE: I know.
LEMONIS: And so, if the business
closes, what happens?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.247
BERNADETTE: We start over.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.482
We start over
from scratch, yeah.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.251
LEMONIS: What does that mean?
You have to file bankruptcy?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.353
BERNADETTE: Mm-hmm. About,
like, a week away from that.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.522
It puts a lot of pressure.

11:30.557 --> 11:33.024
You can hear it in his voice,
and then I know it,

11:33.060 --> 11:35.460
and then I can't sleep, and
that's all you can think about

11:35.495 --> 11:36.761
and it's spinning
in your head

11:36.797 --> 11:39.097
and your stomach's
clenched and...

11:39.132 --> 11:40.432
It's been very difficult.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.299
LEMONIS: Wow.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.400
STEVE: When business
doesn't go well,

11:42.436 --> 11:46.538
it's hard to be a good father
and a good husband.

11:46.573 --> 11:49.808
And that's the biggest
disappointment.

11:49.843 --> 11:53.044
To me, the most important thing
of my life is my kids,

11:53.080 --> 11:54.045
you know,
being there for them.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.113
I haven't been.

12:00.087 --> 12:03.388
BERNADETTE: It's okay.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.824
LEMONIS: Okay. Do you have some
financials we can look at?

12:05.859 --> 12:07.425
STEVE: Yeah.
LEMONIS: Maybe head inside?

12:07.461 --> 12:08.626
BERNADETTE: Mm-hmm.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.699
LEMONIS: I feel like
I've gotten a good sense

12:14.735 --> 12:16.701
of the great people
that work here.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.704
The fantastic product,
while inefficiently made,

12:19.740 --> 12:21.840
still a really
quality product.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.641
So, I commend you for that.
STEVE: Thank you very much.

12:23.677 --> 12:25.009
LEMONIS: Let's go through
the P&L.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.544
STEVE: Okay.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.580
LEMONIS: So, your total revenue
for the last 12 months

12:28.615 --> 12:30.248
is $6.9 million.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.418
Your gross profit
is $2.5 million.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.086
Your total expenses...

12:35.122 --> 12:36.187
STEVE: $2.6 million.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.022
LEMONIS: And so, then,
your net profit would be...

12:38.058 --> 12:39.691
STEVE: Minus $100,000.
LEMONIS: Okay.

12:39.726 --> 12:40.658
Have you ever
made money here?

12:40.694 --> 12:42.727
STEVE: Yes.
LEMONIS: What'd you make in '12?

12:42.763 --> 12:43.862
STEVE: About $100,000.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.864
LEMONIS: What'd you make in '13?
STEVE: About $100,000.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.732
LEMONIS: What'd you make in '14?
STEVE: $400,000.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.034
LEMONIS: What'd you make in '15?
STEVE: In '15, we lost money.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.370
When we expanded,
about $1.1 million.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.539
LEMONIS: Okay, so,
$100,000, $100,000,

12:54.574 --> 12:56.407
and $400,000 is how much?
STEVE: $600,000.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.877
LEMONIS: You're at
a $600,000 positive.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.346
You lose $1.1 million in '15.
STEVE: Mm-hmm.

13:01.381 --> 13:05.917
LEMONIS: Takes your $600,000
positive to a $500,000 negative.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.552
STEVE: Well, there were
no retained earnings,

13:07.587 --> 13:09.888
so these earnings
were all taken out.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.623
LEMONIS: What do you mean
they were taken out?

13:11.658 --> 13:13.391
Where did they go?
STEVE: To me.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.060
LEMONIS: So, you took all
the money out of the business?

13:16.096 --> 13:18.630
And so, at the start of '15,
there was no money here.

13:18.665 --> 13:21.466
STEVE: Yeah.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.101
LEMONIS: So,
if I take everything...

13:23.136 --> 13:27.906
your total liability of
$2,885,000 against assets

13:27.941 --> 13:33.478
of $1,239,000, and that means
that you're negative equity.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.614
This business is upside-down...
insolvent...

13:36.650 --> 13:38.383
to the tune
of $1.6 million.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.286
STEVE: Correct.
LEMONIS: The debt is
so significant, really,

13:41.321 --> 13:44.389
it just sits with me
in a very bad way.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.424
So, when I look
around this factory,

13:46.459 --> 13:48.393
how did all of this
get funded?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.495
STEVE: So, originally, the
customers were paying up-front.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.131
LEMONIS: So, essentially,
customers financed

13:53.166 --> 13:54.232
this whole business.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.668
STEVE: And also, in addition,
I put some money in.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.170
It was $1,500.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.205
LEMONIS: 1,500 bucks.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.940
STEVE: Correct.

14:01.975 --> 14:02.874
LEMONIS: Okay.

14:02.909 --> 14:05.577
From an outsider's
perspective looking in,

14:05.612 --> 14:07.579
you put very little money
in the business.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.148
Whatever money the business
made, you took out.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.317
The hole in this business,
now, is $1.6 million.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.052
STEVE: Correct.
LEMONIS: That's not
even to provide

14:14.087 --> 14:15.520
any more working capital.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.355
That's to get
the payables current

14:17.390 --> 14:18.623
and all of
the debt paid off.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.192
STEVE: Correct.
LEMONIS: And where you're
sitting today is,

14:21.228 --> 14:24.162
in a business that, quite
frankly, is out of business.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.732
And I have a real problem with
the fact that you took $600,000

14:27.767 --> 14:30.301
out of the business,
in a business that's growing.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.870
Why did you
take it all out?

14:31.905 --> 14:33.104
STEVE: I didn't
see this coming.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.839

reckless about it.

any acorns for the future.

that's $1.6 million underwater,

15:31.631 --> 15:33.231

15:33.266 --> 15:36.501
the people that work here
are spectacular.

15:36.536 --> 15:41.472
So, I'm willing to lend
this business $3 million

15:41.508 --> 15:45.944
to clean up the payables,
the lenders... everything...

15:45.979 --> 15:48.446

can continue to work

can breathe.

I want to be paid back,
and I want 75% of the equity.

15:57.223 --> 16:00.258
Based on Steve's pattern
of how he deals with money,

16:00.293 --> 16:02.694
I have to structure this deal
very differently

16:02.729 --> 16:03.594

16:03.630 --> 16:05.530
And so, the money
that I'm gonna put in

16:05.565 --> 16:09.100
is gonna go into the company
in the form of debt and equity.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.635

gonna be the lender,

16:10.670 --> 16:12.637

seem aggressive,

16:14.407 --> 16:16.174

23:18.297 --> 23:21.098
but they need to learn
to deal with their issues

23:21.134 --> 23:22.266
by themselves.

23:22.301 --> 23:24.235
I can't resolve
their problems.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.770
I'm not here every day.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.938
AUSTIN: I guess I'm just
gonna squash this.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.241
I'm afraid that, with Lee,
the way he was treating me,

23:30.276 --> 23:32.042
it's done.
It's only a matter of time.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.579
LEMONIS: If your business
is in trouble

23:35.615 --> 23:38.916
and you need my help,
log on to...

23:41.020 --> 23:43.387
AUSTIN: I guess I'm just
gonna squash this.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.423
I'm afraid that,
with Lee, it's done.

23:45.458 --> 23:46.791
It's only
a matter of time.

23:46.826 --> 23:47.658
Lee's new.

23:47.693 --> 23:48.859
He's only been there
a couple of weeks,

23:48.895 --> 23:51.929
but he's an authoritative
person, and he's gonna fire me.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.764
I'm the sacrificial lamb,
if you will.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.099
I guess,
what I'm getting at is, just,

23:55.134 --> 23:56.167
asking for a
little bit of help.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.802
STEVE: There's been a disconnect
between you and I,

23:57.837 --> 23:58.669
for sure, right?

23:58.704 --> 24:00.171
AUSTIN: It's the layer
in between us.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.239
STEVE: So, first thing
Monday morning,

24:02.275 --> 24:03.741
it's obviously something
we should talk about.

24:03.776 --> 24:04.942
LEMONIS: First of all,
I love the fact that

24:04.977 --> 24:06.343
you're having
an open dialogue.

24:06.379 --> 24:07.244
And you've been
a great listener,

24:07.280 --> 24:09.013
and you've been
a great communicator.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.614
The guy gives you
100%.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.616
You have to
hold onto them.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.085
They have to feel protected,
and your job is to protect them.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.688
STEVE: Yeah. Austin,
you don't have to worry.

24:17.723 --> 24:21.792
LEMONIS:
Layers in the cake are creating
a problem for the business.

24:21.828 --> 24:25.463
In most cases, it would be easy
for me to make the decision

24:25.498 --> 24:28.999
for Steve, but I really want
Steve to show leadership,

24:29.035 --> 24:33.270
that he will make sure that he
addresses the issue himself.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.606
The reason people will go
to battle for each other is,

24:35.641 --> 24:37.374
if he knows
you'll have his back.

24:37.410 --> 24:38.943
AUSTIN: Shoulder to shoulder.
Arms in arm.

24:38.978 --> 24:39.743
I'm... You...
STEVE: Okay.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.146
AUSTIN: Yes.
LEMONIS: Let's roll.

24:42.181 --> 24:45.182
♪♪

24:46.052 --> 24:48.853
I think it'd be a good idea
if we can start working on

24:48.888 --> 24:50.354
what a standard unit
would look like.

24:50.389 --> 24:51.655
STEVE: Absolutely.
TRACY: Perfect.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.624
LEMONIS: Now that we've gotten
the feedback from the customers

24:53.659 --> 24:55.159
on what they like
and don't like,

24:55.194 --> 24:57.628
I want to take that information
and incorporate it

24:57.663 --> 25:00.130
into the process of making
the four standard units.

25:00.166 --> 25:03.367
WOMAN: I would advocate for
the door to the opposite end.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.202
LEMONIS:
Is that move possible, guys?

25:05.238 --> 25:06.136
MASON:
Definitely possible.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.405
It opens up space
to enlarge the bathroom,

25:08.441 --> 25:10.341
if needed,
and the closet space.

25:10.376 --> 25:13.544
LEMONIS:
In order for the design process
to actually come out right,

25:13.579 --> 25:15.279
there has to be
communication.

25:15.314 --> 25:17.581
So, I want to show Steve
another leadership tool,

25:17.617 --> 25:19.183
which is collaboration.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.684
TRACY: This is a true
great room here,

25:20.720 --> 25:22.419
and if I really wanted this
to be a bedroom,

25:22.455 --> 25:24.688
I don't have a door
intruding into my area.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.990
STEVE: You've got a
tape measure there.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.425
Can you just measure the width
versus the depth on that thing?

25:28.461 --> 25:30.261
LEMONIS: I like
what I'm seeing with the team

25:30.296 --> 25:32.763
because everybody feels like
their opinion's being heard,

25:32.798 --> 25:34.765
and Steve's doing
a decent job

25:34.800 --> 25:36.834
of actually
orchestrating it all.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.602
So, next time
I see you guys,

25:38.638 --> 25:41.639
I want to see two
standard models, okay?

25:43.543 --> 25:48.746
♪♪

25:48.781 --> 25:49.613
LEMONIS: When we talked
the other day

25:49.649 --> 25:51.916
about Austin and Lee...
STEVE: Yes.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.118
LEMONIS: I wanted to get
an update on where you are.

25:54.153 --> 25:57.988
STEVE:
Myself, Lee, and Stephen started
talking through the situation,

25:58.024 --> 26:00.791
and Austin was pretty frustrated
by it and left.

26:00.826 --> 26:03.727
He said, "I quit,"
and he walked out.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.763
I think he's having a hard time
with the changes.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.364
LEMONIS: So, he's not
working here anymore?

26:07.400 --> 26:10.601
STEVE: Correct.
LEMONIS: I got to be honest
with you, I'm totally confused,

26:10.636 --> 26:12.536
because a couple
of weeks ago,

26:12.572 --> 26:14.705
Steve and Austin
are talking about how

26:14.740 --> 26:18.809
they're gonna work together and
how Steve is gonna protect him.

26:18.844 --> 26:21.078
And now, I'm finding out
that, yesterday,

26:21.113 --> 26:23.380
Austin stormed out
of here and quit.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.449
Like, what happens
when I'm not here?

26:25.484 --> 26:29.286
So, I call Austin because I want
to know exactly what happened.

26:29.322 --> 26:31.255
I want the facts.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.256
What happened yesterday?

26:32.291 --> 26:33.824
AUSTIN: They said that
we need to figure out

26:33.859 --> 26:35.593
how to talk about
the seven-layer cake,

26:35.628 --> 26:38.596
and their way of addressing that
and through our conversation

26:38.631 --> 26:40.130
was showing the hierarchy
on the board.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.365
LEMONIS: Okay.
AUSTIN: And I jumped the gun

26:41.400 --> 26:44.301
because they circled me, and
then, the three people below me.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.770
LEMONIS: Meaning that one of
you guys was gonna go away?

26:46.806 --> 26:48.472
AUSTIN: Right.
LEMONIS: And you just wanted
to protect them.

26:48.507 --> 26:51.075
AUSTIN: If I've got to be
the casualty, that's fine.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.777
LEMONIS: I partially invested
in this business 'cause of you.

26:53.813 --> 26:56.313
We thought we were
gonna work together.

26:56.349 --> 27:00.451
I told you, [BLEEP] happens out
here, not in some fancy office.

27:00.486 --> 27:02.720
AUSTIN: Someone's gonna
get the ax.
LEMONIS: Right.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.021
AUSTIN: And it better be me
and not them.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.689
LEMONIS: Nope. It ain't
gonna be you,

27:05.725 --> 27:07.224
and it ain't gonna
be them, either.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.193
AUSTIN: I mean, I...
LEMONIS: It ain't gonna be
anybody that's on the floor.

27:09.228 --> 27:10.494
AUSTIN: Thank you, man.

27:10.529 --> 27:11.962
Thank you,
and I believe you.

27:11.998 --> 27:12.963
LEMONIS: Why don't we
get everybody together

27:12.999 --> 27:15.099
in the conference room
from yesterday, okay?

27:15.134 --> 27:18.002
AUSTIN: Yes.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.136
LEMONIS: Hey, so,
I know you guys had

27:19.171 --> 27:20.804
a get-together
yesterday.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.206
You want to, maybe,
lead the process?

27:22.241 --> 27:26.343
STEVE: Sure.
Okay, so, what happened is,
yesterday we had a meeting

27:26.379 --> 27:28.779
that started off on the
shop floor and led into here,

27:28.814 --> 27:30.447
where, Austin,
you walked out.

27:30.483 --> 27:31.482
AUSTIN:
Guys, come on.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.617
I put three years of my heart,
soul, and energy

27:33.653 --> 27:36.286
into this place, and then,
my world's turned upside down.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.622
LEE: I agree in premise that
we have a structural issue

27:38.658 --> 27:41.158
to fix in this company,
but there's a difference between

27:41.193 --> 27:42.960
staying in the room
and hashing it out

27:42.995 --> 27:45.863
and looking at your colleagues
and saying,

27:45.898 --> 27:48.365
"You don't know your business.
I resign."

27:48.401 --> 27:50.300
There is the chance
that this is the path

27:50.336 --> 27:51.235
that we're
going to go down.

27:51.270 --> 27:52.970
AUSTIN: Well, what I saw
was my family...

27:53.005 --> 27:54.304
it's turned upside down.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.539
That's how I felt.

27:55.574 --> 27:58.842
LEMONIS: So, were you mildly
relieved when he left yesterday?

27:58.878 --> 28:00.711
LEE: The company's
not profitable.

28:00.746 --> 28:02.746
The business model
is not successful.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.148
AUSTIN: Is it their fault?
LEE: The plan...

28:04.183 --> 28:05.582
You're not letting me finish.
AUSTIN: Okay.

28:05.618 --> 28:06.550
LEE: You resigned.

28:06.585 --> 28:08.185
You can't have people,
especially managers,

28:08.220 --> 28:09.086
who just resign
and then decide,

28:09.121 --> 28:10.421
"Mm, I'm gonna
come back the next day,

28:10.456 --> 28:11.689
and I'm going to
start work.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.857
Maybe the next day after that
I'll decide to resign again."

28:13.893 --> 28:15.192
STEVE: If you would've
stopped and said,

28:15.227 --> 28:16.927
"Guys, I am not
comfortable with this.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.595
I need the rest of
the day to process,"

28:18.631 --> 28:20.898
that's one thing.
But you didn't contribute.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.433
You just said,
"Hey, I'm out of here."

28:22.468 --> 28:23.767
AUSTIN:
But I mean, Steve,

28:23.803 --> 28:25.602
a guy that had been with you
from the beginning

28:25.638 --> 28:29.206
that you talked very highly
about... you panicked.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.275
What is your opinion
about what should change

28:31.310 --> 28:32.176
in the seven layers?

28:32.211 --> 28:33.610
STEVE: These two
would go to one layer,

28:33.646 --> 28:34.511
and these two would
go to one layer.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.613
LEMONIS: So, you're going
seven to four.

28:36.649 --> 28:38.248
LEMONIS: And so,
just out of curiosity...

28:38.284 --> 28:39.450
I'll just go ahead
and start with you,

28:39.485 --> 28:40.751
'cause you're
squeezing yourself...

28:40.786 --> 28:42.186
is you or Lee surviving?

28:42.221 --> 28:45.723
STEVE: Why not both?
Why can't there be
two people on the same layer?

28:45.758 --> 28:47.991
LEMONIS: Are you really trying
to sell me on this [BLEEP]?

28:51.430 --> 28:53.097
Anything change
in the staff?

28:53.132 --> 28:55.099
STEVE: Actually,
a couple people have left.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.767
LEMONIS: People left?
STEVE: Yes.

28:56.802 --> 28:57.801
LEMONIS: Oh.
STEVE: Yeah.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.503
LEMONIS: Okay.
Who left?

29:00.572 --> 29:02.506
LEMONIS: Is you
or Lee surviving?

29:03.909 --> 29:05.642
STEVE: Why not both?
Why can't there be two people
on the same layer?

29:05.711 --> 29:07.644
LEMONIS: Are you really trying
to sell me on this [BLEEP]?

29:07.713 --> 29:10.614
In one breath, you're saying you
think there's too many layers.

29:10.683 --> 29:12.816
Your suggestion is,
they're co-managers?

29:12.885 --> 29:15.652
STEVE: Correct.
LEMONIS: Steve, this is
a very important moment.

29:15.721 --> 29:17.688
Both of our jobs is
to put the company

29:17.757 --> 29:19.857
in front of our own
personal interests.

29:19.925 --> 29:23.060
And so, you are permitted
to come back to work here.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.194
AUSTIN: Yes, sir.

29:25.297 --> 29:26.130
LEMONIS: And you and I will
continue to work together.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.064
STEVE: Perfect.
LEMONIS: All right?

29:27.967 --> 29:29.166
This is the most
drama-filled manufacturer

29:29.235 --> 29:30.768
I've ever been to
in my life.

29:35.741 --> 29:38.408
LEE: So, what are we thinking
about the next few weeks?

29:38.477 --> 29:39.543
What would you like
out of me?

29:40.646 --> 29:41.812
LEMONIS: I think you have to
decide if you feel like,

29:41.881 --> 29:43.981
you know,
you could add value here.

29:44.049 --> 29:44.848
I think that's
the question.

29:45.751 --> 29:46.383
LEE: I mean I've been around
long enough

29:47.219 --> 29:47.985
that I think you need me
LEMONIS: Yeah.

29:48.053 --> 29:50.087
LEE: Austin has
some capabilities,

29:50.156 --> 29:52.022
but I'm not sure that
he could run at the layer

29:52.091 --> 29:54.358
that really should be required
for a company of this size.

29:54.426 --> 29:57.861
The right model is to have a GM
or a site leader for this sized
operation

29:57.930 --> 30:00.664
This plant you'd have to burn it
to the ground and redo it

30:00.800 --> 30:03.901
LEMONIS: If Steve was actually
managing correctly

30:03.969 --> 30:05.903
and Austin was able to get the
raw materials

30:06.372 --> 30:08.405
and not have all these layers
over him.

30:08.474 --> 30:09.506
Things would be fine.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.275
I just need to make a few tweaks

30:11.343 --> 30:14.244
not burn the business to the
ground and start over

30:14.313 --> 30:16.213
The question is are you going to
be here?

30:16.348 --> 30:17.347
is Steve going to be here?

30:17.416 --> 30:19.183
or are neither of you going to
be here?

30:24.623 --> 30:27.825
LEMONIS: Currently, the trailer
manufacturing of the frames
themselves

30:27.893 --> 30:30.394
takes up over 30% of the floor
space

30:30.529 --> 30:33.096
and so what I want to do is
outsource the manufacturing

30:33.165 --> 30:34.264
of those trailers and

30:34.333 --> 30:36.900
the amount of production that I
can run through

30:36.969 --> 30:40.737
that area will almost double the
production of the company

30:40.906 --> 30:43.974
LEMONIS: So we are at a local
manufacturer called Excalibur
which by the way

30:44.043 --> 30:48.045
can produce twice as much as
tumbleweed was able to produce
before

30:48.113 --> 30:49.880
LEMONIS: If I gave you
75 to make,

30:49.949 --> 30:51.915
what's the best you could do
on that 75?

30:51.984 --> 30:55.219
'Cause we think we're gonna
make... call it 250 a year.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.054
MAN: Let's do 80
of them at 4,900.

30:57.122 --> 30:58.121
LEMONIS: Okay.
STEVE: Great.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.324
MAN: All right.

31:00.392 --> 31:01.658
LEMONIS: Now that
we've struck a deal

31:01.727 --> 31:03.760
to move trailer
production off site,

31:03.829 --> 31:06.563
with the additional space

upset about Austin being brought
back, being overruled on that.

thing for him.

I'm surprised that Lee

So, I think now that you guys

maybe, 10 to 15 or 20 a year.

a similar unit,

STEVE: I'm gonna push back

34:13.652 --> 34:14.484
So, my concern is,
we took our best guys

34:14.553 --> 34:15.284
and we put them on this unit

34:16.054 --> 34:16.520

and a half weeks,

34:17.289 --> 34:18.355
and the other ones
get slowed down.

34:19.458 --> 34:20.357
One of our rules is,
we've got to protect the floor,

34:21.393 --> 34:24.027
and when we do this,
we don't protect the floor.

34:24.096 --> 34:25.495
LEMONIS: Hallelujah.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.364

of wanting to protect

34:28.434 --> 34:30.000
the stability of the floor

34:30.069 --> 34:32.202
makes me want to
follow your lead.

having that evolution to say,

34:35.206 --> 34:37.641

but I'm not willing to

34:37.708 --> 34:40.577
break my people
or my customers for it."

34:40.646 --> 34:43.513

is really the epiphany.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.315
So, what is the time?

34:45.384 --> 34:47.350
STEVE: Well, it's
about 3 1/2 to 4 weeks.

compromise 3 1/2?

38:49.661 --> 38:51.861
and integrate it
into the standard model

38:51.930 --> 38:54.230
shows me that
they're good listeners.

38:54.299 --> 38:56.433
And that's the key
to manufacturing...

final product.

TRACY:
The bathroom, ladies.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.905
ANNIE: Yeah, this is huge.
PAT: Wow, nice!

39:01.973 --> 39:02.939
Oh, this is great.

39:03.942 --> 39:05.075
TRACY: It was really just
about making sure that

39:05.143 --> 39:06.943
we were really
maximizing.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.778
PAT: Every inch counts
with a tiny house, right?

39:08.847 --> 39:10.747
ANNIE: Absolutely.
PAT: That is great.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.515
Yeah.
Very nice, Tracy.

39:12.584 --> 39:15.652
AUSTIN: And this room right here
is our utility closet.

39:15.721 --> 39:18.021
It's all located in one area
for your maintenance man.

39:18.090 --> 39:18.922
PAT: Yeah,
this is great.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.424
And then, I know
we have a similar unit

39:21.493 --> 39:23.560
and the pitch of the roof
was a little bit higher.

39:23.628 --> 39:24.627
AUSTIN: Yeah, you
raised it a little bit?
PAT: Yeah.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.163
It makes a big difference
when you're in the loft.

39:27.232 --> 39:28.098
LEMONIS:
To make the roof higher?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.700
PAT: Yeah.
Would you have that flexibility?

39:32.270 --> 39:33.636
LEMONIS: What I'm wondering
is...

39:33.705 --> 39:35.739
what Steve's response is going
to be?

39:35.807 --> 39:37.140
If he starts agreeing to

39:37.209 --> 39:39.642
well we'll change this by an
inch and that by an inch

39:39.778 --> 39:40.643
and move the roof up

39:40.712 --> 39:41.478
and we'll do all these things

39:56.762 --> 39:59.763
PAT: Yeah.
Would you have that flexibility?

39:59.798 --> 40:01.331
STEVE: So, just keep in mind,
as long as

40:01.366 --> 40:03.767
we can make them standard,
then we're gonna be great.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.301
We can't be doing
the custom game.

40:05.337 --> 40:08.671
LEMONIS: I got to be honest...
I'm really impressed

40:08.707 --> 40:11.141
that Steve isn't falling back
to his bad habits

40:11.176 --> 40:15.645
where he would let a buyer of a
product just drive the process.

we make.

40:20.786 --> 40:21.818
We know it's awesome.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.820
We hope you buy it.

40:23.855 --> 40:24.888
Thank you."

40:24.923 --> 40:26.589
PAT: Well, it looks good.
You guys did a great job.

40:26.625 --> 40:27.624
STEVE: Thanks.

40:27.659 --> 40:30.860
So, what, would you say...
5 units, 10 units, 15?

40:30.896 --> 40:32.662
PAT: What's the price point
on this unit today?

40:32.697 --> 40:35.265
STEVE: All right. So, the price
on this one is $79,000.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.367
It does have
a couple upgrades.

40:37.402 --> 40:38.968
PAT: You're ordering
multiple units,

40:39.004 --> 40:40.603
then what does that do
to the discount?

40:40.639 --> 40:42.872
STEVE: When you're buying
half a million dollars,

40:42.908 --> 40:44.040
you've got your discount.

40:44.075 --> 40:47.477
When we get over $750,000,
if we get an order past that,

40:47.512 --> 40:48.778
we will increase
the discount.

40:48.814 --> 40:49.979
And then, if we get past
$1.5 million,

40:50.015 --> 40:51.781
we'll increase the discount
even a little bit more.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.650
LEMONIS: Retroactive.
STEVE: Retroactive, right.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.452
LEMONIS: And so, does that seem
like an arrangement

40:55.487 --> 40:56.786
that we can
move forward on?

40:56.822 --> 40:58.054
PAT: Absolutely.
LEMONIS: Awesome.

40:58.089 --> 40:59.222
PAT: Yeah.
The relationship has evolved.

LEMONIS: Thank you very much.
JEFF: Thank you very much.

41:00.992 --> 41:03.460
LEMONIS: Impressing
an industry leader like ELS

41:03.495 --> 41:05.628
is no small task,
and the fact that

41:05.664 --> 41:09.165
there's a real potential for big
orders is a big accomplishment.

41:09.201 --> 41:10.834
What's changed
with Steve, guys?

41:10.869 --> 41:11.734
TRACY: I feel like
he's actually

41:11.770 --> 41:14.471
reaching out to a lot
of our employees,

41:14.506 --> 41:16.706
and they're recognizing it
and they're seeing it.

41:16.741 --> 41:19.809
AUSTIN: I've heard from the
floor they use your name now.

41:19.845 --> 41:22.979
You helped involve people
in the business.

So, I mean...
LEMONIS: But you respect it.

41:29.554 --> 41:30.720
AUSTIN: I respect
the crap out of it.

41:30.755 --> 41:32.522
That means... 'Cause he's
actually out there on the floor,

41:32.557 --> 41:33.857

we've made the decision

41:36.695 --> 41:40.897
to have you guys become partners
in the business.

like you're connected

41:46.371 --> 41:48.538
to the business as more than
just a team member

41:48.573 --> 41:49.606
with a paycheck.

41:49.641 --> 41:50.740
TRACY: I don't even know
what to think about that.

41:50.775 --> 41:52.175
I mean, that's amazing.

couldn't be more excited

a very bright future.
