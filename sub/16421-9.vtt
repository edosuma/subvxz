00:01.292 --> 00:06.005
[bass guitar playing]

00:06.589 --> 00:08.008
The guys are late again.

00:08.216 --> 00:11.970
This can't happen, and as band manager,
I'm gonna have to get tough with them.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.014
Hey, sorry I'm late. Shooting some hoops.

00:14.139 --> 00:17.100
What? No prob',
who even cares about that stuff anyway.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.603
This girl named
Two-Seconds-Ago Summer used to,

00:20.729 --> 00:21.938
but she's gone now.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.232
Thanks for being cool about it, Summer.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.526
Next time, have a note!

00:28.653 --> 00:30.113
Mr. Finn, you're late.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.614
Rock 'n' roll.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.324
That was your excuse yesterday.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.201
And it's even more true today.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.831
-That reminds me, I was talking to Kale...
-[bongo drums sounding]

00:39.914 --> 00:41.875
And I noticed a speck of green
in her eyes,

00:41.958 --> 00:44.627
and I thought, that's so perfect
because she's green.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.754
She cares about the Earth,

00:45.837 --> 00:48.131
she cares about people,
and she likes mustard,

00:48.214 --> 00:51.217
and that's important because
I like mustard.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.344
Summer, you okay?

00:53.636 --> 00:56.473
'Cause you're playing that bongo
like it called your mama ugly.

00:57.515 --> 01:02.729
I've been meaning to talk to you about the
inferior quality of our instruments.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.106
They're so flimsy.

01:06.399 --> 01:11.404
[grunting]

01:12.655 --> 01:15.825
-[drumstick snapping]
-See?

01:17.202 --> 01:19.245
Those were my favourite sticks!

01:20.330 --> 01:22.040
What do you have to say for yourself,
Summer?

01:22.874 --> 01:24.459
Rock 'n' roll!

01:24.876 --> 01:27.212
Wow, really turned that around on me,
didn't ya?

01:31.174 --> 01:32.634
Hey, sweet lid, Zack.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.553
Oh, this? I forgot I had it on.

01:36.012 --> 01:39.098
There's a picture of you wearing it
on the internet from 30 seconds ago

01:39.182 --> 01:41.434
with the hashtag #hatlife.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.770
Oh, good! So I'm trending?

01:45.188 --> 01:47.190
-Looks good on you, bro.
-Want to try it on?

01:47.357 --> 01:48.358
No, no, no.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.026
I could never wear a hat,
it's just not me.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.945
-Come on, Freddy--
-I hate hats!

01:54.405 --> 01:58.952
I'm sorry. Full disclosure: lice incident.
I had to shave my head.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.120
[gasping]

02:00.954 --> 02:02.747
It's okay. Besides, if I wore a hat,

02:02.831 --> 02:05.083
Kale wouldn't be able to play
with my hair.

02:05.458 --> 02:11.631
[cymbal crashing]

02:13.091 --> 02:17.345
Uh... yep, these are solid.
We can keep these.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.102
I can't believe I'm losing Freddy,
and only 14 years,

02:24.227 --> 02:26.646
8 months,
and 27 days before our wedding date.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.900
Oh, yeah,
I got your save the imaginary date card.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.903
I know I've said this before,

02:33.987 --> 02:35.905
but you should tell Freddy how you feel
about him.

02:36.114 --> 02:39.659
I tried to tell him at the dance.
I don't want to humiliate myself again.

02:39.826 --> 02:43.413
Come on, when have you ever let
humiliation stop you?

02:44.372 --> 02:46.374
Look, he's obviously into Kale right now.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.376
I can't just come right out
and tell him I like him.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.170
I have to be careful
and find the exact right way

02:51.254 --> 02:53.006
to naturally
and organically shove us together.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.259
My brother's girlfriend says there are,

02:56.342 --> 02:58.303
like, a million ways
to let a guy know you like him

02:58.386 --> 02:59.470
without ever saying it.

02:59.554 --> 03:00.555
Did it sound legit?

03:00.638 --> 03:03.725
She's a junior in high school
and she DJ's on the weekend,

03:03.808 --> 03:04.976
so yeah, she's legit.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.603
[squealing] Tell me!

03:06.728 --> 03:07.729
Hang on, I wrote it down.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.690
[zack speaking indistinctly]

03:10.815 --> 03:13.276
"Here are ways girls let guys know
they like them."

03:14.694 --> 03:16.988
We're gonna miss out on corndogs
if we don't hurry.

03:17.196 --> 03:19.282
This could be the secret to happiness.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.952
I already know the secret to happiness:
corndogs.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.332
"If you want to let a guy know
you like him without actually telling him,

03:27.415 --> 03:29.584
you have to laugh at his jokes."

03:29.667 --> 03:30.668
Laugh.

03:30.793 --> 03:33.421
"Find an excuse
to casually touch his arm."

03:33.546 --> 03:35.423
Maybe pull some lint off his sweater
or something.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.635
Oh, to be the lint on Freddy's sweater.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.889
"And always maintain eye contact."

03:42.972 --> 03:44.182
Hmm, eye contact.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.892
Hmm, eye contact.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.686
Hmm, my contacts are still bothering me.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.897
Whenever I get new ones,
it always takes a couple hours

03:51.022 --> 03:52.774
to break them in before I can see.

03:53.107 --> 03:56.527
I'm happy to be your eyes until
your real ones are working again, ma'am.

Do you have a Taser, Clark?

I-- I've said too much.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.040
Pursuing on foot.

04:13.378 --> 04:17.298
Oh, Zack, that hat is not part
of the school uniform, is it?

04:17.423 --> 04:18.800
Uh, no, ma'am.

04:24.305 --> 04:27.433
You seem to be looking at me
for an extended period of time.

04:28.059 --> 04:31.271
Yes, that's right, I am.
And don't forget it.

Did you see that?

you know about the ladies.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.102
[chuckling] Yes, yes, I do.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.814
Okay, how do you tell if a girl likes you
if she's telling you

08:01.898 --> 08:04.275
she likes you without actually saying
she likes you?

We think someone has a crush on Zack.
Yesterday he was talking to--

Shh! A gentleman never names names.
Let me ask you a couple questions.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.626
Did she hit you with the peepers,
eye contact?

08:22.877 --> 08:25.713
Hmm, was there any arm touching?
Like, was she going to for lint?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.634
Then she's having a Zack attack.

08:30.968 --> 08:33.930
It's science. Lady science.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.518
Oh, boy. I don't want her to like me.
What am I gonna do?

08:38.684 --> 08:43.231
You gotta be a man, be honest with her,
and let her down gently.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.235
Actually, you know what?
You should just text her.

Hey, thanks for meeting me.

for a while.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.958
Wait, do you mind if I film this?

09:02.333 --> 09:03.334
I guess not.

09:03.960 --> 09:04.961
Action.

09:05.169 --> 09:08.005
I want to get Kale a present,
and she seems to really like your taste.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.092
So should I get her a stuffed octopus
or a gift card for a vegan restaurant?

09:11.175 --> 09:12.301
Yes, I will!

09:12.927 --> 09:14.428
[Both] What did you say?

09:15.054 --> 09:18.266
It's our one month-iversary
and I want to get Kale somethingspecial.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.226
So, stuffed octopus or gift card?

09:20.810 --> 09:22.478
I'm so stupid.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.355
No, it's a tough question.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.858
-Octopus.
-Thanks, Summer.

You're a life saver.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.455
Ouch, that's hard.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.209
But at least now you know what kind
of girl he likes.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.461
Yeah, I do, he likes Kale.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.797
So, you can move on now.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.843
Oh, I see what you're saying.

09:54.218 --> 09:57.013
I should stop being myself
and be who he wants me to be.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.975
No, I'm not saying that at all.
That's terrible advice.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.435
No, you're right.

10:02.518 --> 10:05.730
I just have to be even more crunchy
and hippie than she is.

10:11.027 --> 10:14.405
No, I'm not saying to do this.
It's a bad idea.

10:15.197 --> 10:18.159
You're a great friend to offer help,
but I have it from here.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.161

ever seen a girl who loves the environment

of food scraps?

Who could've seen that coming?
Oh, right, me.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.516
I hope this taught you that
you should just be yourself.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.683
Exactly.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.061
I have to show Freddy how great I am
on the inside.

11:27.144 --> 11:30.648
-Yes.
-By making my insides just like Kale's!

11:30.773 --> 11:34.110
I'll act like her, I'll think like her.
I'll be her.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.903
Thought I had you out of the crazy tree,

11:35.986 --> 11:38.114
but you climbed right back up there,
didn't you?

11:39.073 --> 11:40.991
Who wants a taste of Mother Nature?

11:41.075 --> 11:44.870
It's my famous wheatgrass sprout-tacular
shiitake sludge-gurt.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.122
Yummers!

11:47.957 --> 11:50.418
[choking and coughing]

11:50.584 --> 11:52.378
You can really taste the sludge.

11:54.004 --> 11:57.216
You want one, Tomika?
I think I have some frond pulp left.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.803
Oh, I had a big bowl
of frond pulp this morning.

12:00.970 --> 12:01.971
See you guys.

12:03.472 --> 12:04.640
Good luck.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.018
I had an ulterior motive
for bringing you the smoothie.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.897
I wanted to ask if you'd go shopping
with me to find something for Freddy.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.315
It's our one month-iversary.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.026
-Yay...
-I know!

12:16.110 --> 12:18.446
The first month with my first boyfriend.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.073
I really want
to get him just the right thing.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.076
You two seem like good friends
and you know what he likes.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.913
I would love to!

12:28.080 --> 12:31.167
And Freddy doesn't have
to know I helped at all.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.960
Thank you so much, Summer!

12:35.087 --> 12:36.255
Bye!

12:37.339 --> 12:44.138
[laughing maniacally]

12:44.221 --> 12:45.764
-Summer.
-Tomika!

12:47.600 --> 12:49.518
-I thought you left.
-Nope.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.812
Freddy isn't going to like his gift,
is he?

12:52.188 --> 12:53.606
What makes you think that?

12:53.856 --> 12:56.317
Well,
the evil laugh was a pretty good clue.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.152
You're right.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.529
And when he complains
about her awful gift,

13:00.613 --> 13:05.034
I'll swoop in with the perfect present:
Dave Grohl's Signature Series Drumsticks.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.245
[gasping] You're going to use Dave Grohl
for evil?

13:09.663 --> 13:12.416
Once he sees those sticks,
he'll know that I get him,

13:12.500 --> 13:13.751
and that we're meant to be together.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.836
You can't just give him a gift
for no reason.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.338
There is a reason.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.508
It's the one day-versary
of me breaking his drumsticks.

13:24.261 --> 13:27.431
Oh, that really tastes like a lawn!

13:30.059 --> 13:35.814
[laughing] That is hysterical!
That is the funniest punchline ever!

13:35.981 --> 13:37.316
"Snickerdoodle!"

13:39.693 --> 13:42.196
Oh, this contact is still bothering me.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.323
I'll see you later.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.952
-There she is. Let her down gently.
-Right.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.165
No, can't do it! [thudding]

13:53.499 --> 13:55.084
Hello, Lawrence.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.002
Hello, Principal Mullins.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.589
Oh, Lawrence, one second.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.633
I need you to read me the lunch menu.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.802
Really? It's right there.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.388
But I want you to read it. Please.

14:08.264 --> 14:12.726
Uh, fried chicken with macaroni.
And for dessert, uh, snickerdoodle.

14:12.810 --> 14:16.313
[laughing]

14:16.689 --> 14:17.815
Snickerdoodle!

14:18.607 --> 14:20.484
That's classic!

14:20.651 --> 14:22.862
You're laughing
for aninappropriately long time!

14:22.945 --> 14:26.323
[laughing]

14:31.912 --> 14:35.749
[Both screaming]

14:36.166 --> 14:37.585
What!? What is it!?

14:37.793 --> 14:40.713
-She's into me now!
-She's into both of us!

14:40.796 --> 14:44.133
Why do we have to be so attractive!?

14:45.134 --> 14:47.052
Listen to yourselves.

14:47.136 --> 14:50.764
One day I'll bet you'll be very happy
this young lady was sweet on you.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.934
You just need to figure out which one
of you is the lucky man.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.144
[Both] He is!

14:55.811 --> 14:58.063
Guys, we need to be adults here.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.816
This is probably a first relationship
for her, too.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.320
-You think?
-Yeah, that makes sense.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.073
You just gotta talk to her openly
and honestly.

15:08.449 --> 15:12.620
And when you do, I'm gonna tag along,
because I'm in too deep.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.665
[music playing]

15:20.878 --> 15:21.921
When you said shopping,

15:22.004 --> 15:26.008
I thought you meant, like, in a store
at the mall, and not in garbage.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.678
Most things can be repurposed.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.765
What some call garbage,
I call opportunity.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.225
You have a little opportunity
on your shoulder.

15:36.477 --> 15:37.645
Thanks.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.774
I'm not sure anything
in this dumpster's right for Freddy.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.902
What do you think the perfect gift is
for him?

15:45.319 --> 15:48.072
Perfect gift. Hmm...

15:48.238 --> 15:50.157
[Freddy echoing]
I hate hats, I hate hats,

15:50.240 --> 15:51.575
I hate hats!

15:51.825 --> 15:54.745
A hat! He loves hats!

15:55.496 --> 15:57.915
Really? I've never seen him wear a hat.

15:58.123 --> 16:03.712
Oh, you don't know him like I know him.
We always call him Freddy, the hat guy.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.382
Well, that's a great idea.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.842
I'll make him a hat
from something we find right here.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.594
A garbage hat!

16:10.678 --> 16:13.013
Now we can call him Freddy,
the garbage hat guy.

16:14.098 --> 16:17.017
If I could just make
Freddy's face light up,

16:17.101 --> 16:19.478
I'd be so happy to know that he's happy.

16:20.729 --> 16:23.357
Wow, you really are a nice person.

16:23.857 --> 16:24.900
So are you, Summer.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.737
I am so glad we met.
My family moves around a lot,

16:28.821 --> 16:30.614
so I've had a hard time making friends.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.158
But you seem so cool and confident.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.244
I am not so cool.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.831
Some people think it's annoying
because I care so much about everything.

16:39.957 --> 16:43.460
But here you are,
digging through the dumpster with me.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.586
I'm not here for you,

16:44.670 --> 16:46.505
I'm here 'cause I like putting
my favourite loafer

16:46.588 --> 16:48.424
-in a bucket of oysters.
-[laughing]

16:48.674 --> 16:50.342
No, seriously,
my foot's stuck in something.

16:52.761 --> 16:56.181
You know, you remind me
of McKenna Doherty from--

16:56.265 --> 16:57.474
[Both] Terminal Hearts!

16:58.058 --> 16:59.518
That's my favourite book!

17:00.394 --> 17:01.979
Mine, too!

17:03.230 --> 17:05.858
Oh, she's always going out of her way
to help someone out.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.609
Like you.

17:08.444 --> 17:13.490
Well, she might be a teensy
bit better person than me.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.370
[Zack] There she is.

17:18.537 --> 17:22.750
You guys are afraid of her? That's insane.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.419
Be honest with your feelings.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.261
Principal Mullins?

17:37.473 --> 17:41.685
We'd like you to speak to you about a...
sensitive matter.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.354
All right.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.440
We've been picking up
what you're putting down.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.277
What am I putting down?

17:50.444 --> 17:53.697
We felt the vibe and we need
to know who you're crushing on.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.701
I think there's been a mistake.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.953
No, Mr. Finn, you said you wanted to know.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.665
Principal Mullins,
tell us who you've got the hots for.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.750
What!?

18:04.833 --> 18:08.170
Sorry, this is kind of awkward.
Time to vamoose!

18:08.253 --> 18:10.005
Mr. Finn, I sincerely hope

18:10.089 --> 18:12.382
you don't have these boys
asking questions that

18:12.466 --> 18:13.926
you yourself want answers to.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.135
No, they just--

18:16.512 --> 18:20.349
Wait, what? You think I...?

18:22.226 --> 18:23.519
About-- about you...?

18:24.937 --> 18:25.938
I mean...

18:29.817 --> 18:32.569
I'd like us all to pretend this never
happened.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.573
I'll leave you gentlemen
to answer your own questions.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.284
Good day.

18:48.710 --> 18:52.339
Hey, what does it mean when a girl looks
over her shoulder and smiles at you?

18:52.840 --> 18:55.134
You know who you should ask?
Tomika's brother's girlfriend.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.218
Is she legit?

18:56.385 --> 18:57.886
She DJ's on weekends, so...

18:57.970 --> 18:58.971
Let's call her!

19:03.392 --> 19:06.061
What am I doing?
Kale doesn't deserve this.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.480
Am I becoming a bad person?

19:08.730 --> 19:11.567
The answer is yes.
The mirror's taking too long.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.779
The Summer I know wouldn't change herself
for anyone.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.574
And she certainly wouldn't try
to steal someone's boyfriend.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.868
Why are you just telling me this now?

19:21.076 --> 19:23.203
I've been telling you for three days!

19:24.371 --> 19:25.622
A part of me knew that.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.667
But I didn't listen and now it's too late.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.419
Is it too late?

19:30.752 --> 19:32.337
She gave him the terrible gift already?

19:32.629 --> 19:33.755
No.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.383
She was going to give it
to him when the last bell rings.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.385
You still have three minutes.

19:38.719 --> 19:39.970
I can stop her if I leave right now!

19:40.053 --> 19:41.889
-Yes, go!
-Which way is faster?

19:41.972 --> 19:43.724
The east hallway or the west hallway,
'cause if I--

19:43.807 --> 19:44.808
Will you go!?

19:47.686 --> 19:49.021
You know you're my best friend, right?

19:49.271 --> 19:51.356
[chuckling] Go right now!

19:51.648 --> 19:58.655
[music playing]

19:58.739 --> 20:05.746
[music playing]

20:17.841 --> 20:19.092
[school bell ringing]

20:20.802 --> 20:27.476
[music playing]

20:27.726 --> 20:29.811
Don't... stop...

20:30.270 --> 20:31.313
Believin'?

20:32.356 --> 20:36.068
No. I mean, don't give him that,
give him this.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.320
Trust me.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.531
Of course I trust you. You're my friend.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.078
Hey, what's in the box?

20:46.453 --> 20:48.080
It's a present for you.

20:48.288 --> 20:49.539
Cool, I got you this.

20:54.127 --> 20:57.631
Oh, Freddy, I love him! Is he endangered?

20:58.173 --> 20:59.633
He was the last one on the shelf.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.261
Good enough.

21:05.847 --> 21:10.852
Oh, man!
Dave Grohl Signature Series Drumsticks?

21:10.978 --> 21:12.437
You know me better than I know myself!

21:12.521 --> 21:13.522
[gasping]

21:15.482 --> 21:17.359
I'm just gonna let you have your moment.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.201
Happy month-iversary, Kale.

21:26.493 --> 21:27.869
Happy month-iversary, Freddy.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.629
You did the right thing.

21:38.380 --> 21:42.843
Yeah, I know. I'm a good person.
I guess my reward is knowing that.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.886
This is your reward.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.309
This is kinda cute.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.147
It's made from garbage, isn't it?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.153
[music playing]

22:01.611 --> 22:08.618
[music playing]
