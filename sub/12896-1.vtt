WEBVTT

01:46.254 --> 01:48.356
Come in, Mrs. Sugrue.

01:48.390 --> 01:50.058
Katie, darlin.'

01:50.092 --> 01:52.827
Can you lend me the loan
of a small pinch of tea?

01:52.860 --> 01:55.063
I'll pay you back Thursday.

01:55.097 --> 01:57.532
You can have it and welcome.

01:57.565 --> 01:59.834
I knew you wouldn't
refuse old Sheelah,

01:59.867 --> 02:02.003
and I knew you'd have
rations and leavings,

02:02.036 --> 02:04.038
for there's little
that's lacking here,

02:04.072 --> 02:07.075
unless 'twould be a man
to cook for.

02:07.109 --> 02:08.910
I have me father to cook for.

02:08.943 --> 02:11.913
So you do, so you do,
but I meant a man of your own.

02:11.946 --> 02:14.048
Time enough for that.

02:14.082 --> 02:16.918
"Time enough" lost the ducks.

02:16.951 --> 02:19.787
There's many a lass
that lost her market

02:19.821 --> 02:22.056
from waiting too long.

02:22.090 --> 02:25.893
Oh, you can smile now,
but who in this town
would have you?

02:25.927 --> 02:26.928
Am I that bad?

02:26.961 --> 02:28.930
You miss the meaning.

02:28.963 --> 02:31.899
There's not a man
doesn't want you,

02:31.933 --> 02:35.437
but who among them
dare look at you

02:35.470 --> 02:37.939
with the grand house
you live in?

02:37.972 --> 02:41.809
A fine situation
your father has
with his lordship.

02:41.843 --> 02:43.077
Take my son Pony.

02:43.111 --> 02:45.447
He don't dare raise
his eyes to you,

02:45.480 --> 02:47.482
and him the catch of the town.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.817
Now, I would have said

02:49.851 --> 02:51.919
that Pony thought
no small beer of himself.

02:51.953 --> 02:53.455
Oh, he's proud.

02:53.488 --> 02:55.957
He's proud
as a white-washed pig,

02:55.990 --> 02:58.760
but he needs encouragement
from you.

02:58.793 --> 03:01.763
You should be looking
ahead, Katie.

03:03.931 --> 03:06.901
Your father
is getting no younger,

03:06.934 --> 03:09.571
and when the time comes

03:09.604 --> 03:11.773
that he must step down...

03:13.841 --> 03:16.911
...who else will there be
but Pony Sugrue

03:16.944 --> 03:18.913
who can take his place?

03:18.946 --> 03:21.082
Don't put me father
in his grave just yet.

03:21.115 --> 03:23.117
Oh, the saints forbid.

03:23.151 --> 03:25.820
He'll be spared
for many years, God willin'.

03:25.853 --> 03:27.589
(hoofbeats)

03:27.622 --> 03:30.525
That must be Pony now.

03:30.558 --> 03:33.127
No, it's not.

03:33.161 --> 03:36.063
Merciful heavens!
It's Lord Fitzpatrick himself.

03:43.305 --> 03:44.372
Hello, Katie.

03:44.406 --> 03:47.041
Your Lordship,
why didn't you tell us
you were coming?

03:47.074 --> 03:49.277
I'd have opened
the manor house for you.

03:49.311 --> 03:51.151
I'll not be stopping here
long enough for that.

03:51.179 --> 03:53.114
Where's your father?

03:53.147 --> 03:55.483
Well, now, let me see.

03:55.517 --> 03:59.787
Um... I heard him sayin',
um, something about

03:59.821 --> 04:02.123
cuttin' the weeds
around the summer house.

04:02.156 --> 04:05.159
I think he'll have gone
to have the smithy
sharpen his scythe.

04:05.193 --> 04:06.794
I'll fetch him for you,
Your Lordship.

04:06.828 --> 04:09.431
Well, that's good of you.

04:14.536 --> 04:16.303
That Katie's a grand girl.

04:16.338 --> 04:18.240
Almost makes up for her father.

04:18.273 --> 04:19.741
What ails him?

04:19.774 --> 04:21.509
Oh, nothing at all,

04:21.543 --> 04:24.746
but he retired
about five years ago,
didn't tell me about it.

04:24.779 --> 04:27.549
He'll be down at the inn now,
telling stories.

04:27.582 --> 04:29.884
Well, let's go and have
a look at the gatehouse.

04:37.191 --> 04:39.193
Oh, I didn't know
anybody was here.

04:39.227 --> 04:41.229
I'm the Widow Sugrue,
Your Lordship.

04:41.263 --> 04:44.499
I often comes in to help.
I see.

04:44.532 --> 04:47.201
Begging Your Lordship's
pardon-- I'm the mother
of Pony Sugrue.

04:47.235 --> 04:49.271
He drives the mail cart
to Cahersiveen

04:49.304 --> 04:51.072
whenever the train comes in.

04:51.105 --> 04:53.341
I'm very glad to hear it.

04:53.375 --> 04:56.878
He's a fine strong lad.
He's worthy of greater things.

04:56.911 --> 04:59.281
Is he, now?
Aye, he is indeed.

04:59.314 --> 05:02.550
You'll never hear me speak
a word against Darby O'Gill,

05:02.584 --> 05:04.519
but he's gettin' on.

05:04.552 --> 05:08.055
When the time comes
for you to hire
a younger man,

05:08.089 --> 05:10.525
give a thought to m'lad Pony.

05:10.558 --> 05:13.227
I'm not sure I want a man
who is too well known
to the town.

05:13.261 --> 05:15.229
A man from outside
would be more respected.

05:15.263 --> 05:18.065
My Pony is respected
and feared, too.

05:18.099 --> 05:20.268
He's whipped every man
in the parish.

05:20.302 --> 05:23.271
Is that so?
Thank you. Thank you.

05:24.839 --> 05:28.109
If it were Pony you had
in charge of this place,

05:28.142 --> 05:30.912
he wouldn't let it fall
to wrack and ruin

05:30.945 --> 05:33.881
whilst he sat in the pub
telling stories.

05:33.915 --> 05:35.883
Well, I'll tell you,

05:35.917 --> 05:38.753
the first look
I got at him was
in the old ruins

05:38.786 --> 05:40.822
on the top of Knocknasheega.

05:40.855 --> 05:42.824
And what did he
look like, Darby?

05:42.857 --> 05:44.559
Ah, just like
any other leprechaun,

05:44.592 --> 05:46.828
only he, being king of them all,

05:46.861 --> 05:48.830
had a little gold crown
on his head.

05:48.863 --> 05:50.765
Tell me something, Darby.

05:50.798 --> 05:53.568
Did he have a long tail
and a cloven hoof?

05:53.601 --> 05:56.838
Now, whoever heard
of a leprechaun havin' a--

05:56.871 --> 05:58.840
(laughter)

05:58.873 --> 06:01.275
You don't have to listen
if you don't want to, Pony,

06:01.309 --> 06:03.177
but you needn't make fun
of those who do.

06:03.210 --> 06:05.146
But I do.
I want to listen.

06:05.179 --> 06:07.349
I want to learn all about them.

06:07.382 --> 06:09.150
Here, Molly, give me
another large one,

06:09.183 --> 06:11.419
and then maybe I can see
a leprechaun, too.

06:11.453 --> 06:14.121
You'll get no more
whiskey here today,

06:14.155 --> 06:16.157
but if you care to be sociable,

06:16.190 --> 06:18.360
you can have a glass of stout.

06:18.393 --> 06:20.094
I ordered whiskey,

06:20.127 --> 06:22.263
and devil a foot
will I stir from here
until I get it.

06:22.296 --> 06:24.165
Pony Sugrue, you're bloom old

06:24.198 --> 06:26.368
and for want of a beatin',

06:26.401 --> 06:29.804
and if I were
ten years younger,
I'd give it to you.

06:29.837 --> 06:32.306
Ah, but you're-- you're not
ten years younger, are you?

06:32.340 --> 06:34.376
No, I'm not,
but this is my place,

06:34.409 --> 06:36.811
and while you're
in the Rathcullen Arms,

06:36.844 --> 06:38.813
you'll sit quietly,

06:38.846 --> 06:40.382
or I'll have Father Murphy
forbid you

06:40.415 --> 06:43.785
to come here at all.

06:43.818 --> 06:47.088
All right, I'll have the stout.

06:51.158 --> 06:54.896
You were sayin', Darby...?

06:54.929 --> 06:58.833
I was sayin' this wasn't
like any old leprechaun

06:58.866 --> 07:01.068
that you wouldn't
say hello twice to.

07:01.102 --> 07:05.206
But who was he

07:05.239 --> 07:07.842
but Brian Connors himself,

07:07.875 --> 07:09.377
the king of them all.

07:09.411 --> 07:12.213
But I got me eye fixed on him.

07:12.246 --> 07:14.382
They can't escape, you know,

07:14.416 --> 07:17.885
as long as you don't look away.

07:17.919 --> 07:20.321
Now, the night was dark

07:20.354 --> 07:24.859
and the mountain
was covered with mist...

07:24.892 --> 07:27.895
and the moon was no bigger

07:27.929 --> 07:30.364
than the light
from a wee penny candle.

07:32.934 --> 07:35.269
But it didn't hide him
from me...

07:37.138 --> 07:41.208
...for there he stood,
with an angry little gob on him

07:41.242 --> 07:43.445
and his face as fierce as fire.

07:43.478 --> 07:46.247
King Brian, me old boyo,
I've got you at last,

07:46.280 --> 07:48.349
and I'm not gonna let you go

07:48.382 --> 07:50.360
until you grant me the favor
of three grand wishes.

07:50.384 --> 07:53.387
Wait now, wait now,
maybe we can talk this over.

07:53.421 --> 07:55.389
Will you have a pinch of snuff?

07:55.423 --> 07:57.358
Aye, and you'll blow it
into me eyes.

07:57.391 --> 07:59.360
I'm up to all
your dirty little tricks.

07:59.393 --> 08:02.363
You've gone too far.
You'll get no wishes
from me at all now.

08:02.396 --> 08:05.366
You'll either give them to me,
or else you'll answer
to the Church.

08:05.399 --> 08:07.401
I'll have Father Murphy
curse you with a blessin'

08:07.435 --> 08:09.471
that'll shrivel you up
in a minute.

08:09.504 --> 08:12.406
All right, then,
wish your wishes
and be done with it.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.408
I've work to do at home.

08:14.442 --> 08:17.111
Ah, don't rush me.
Don't rush you?

08:17.144 --> 08:19.914
Mean to say
you're not gonna wish
for a crock of gold?

08:19.947 --> 08:23.384
I may in due time,
but what's gold to a man

08:23.417 --> 08:27.421
if he be too sick
or too sad to enjoy it?

08:27.455 --> 08:29.390
Ah, you're the thinkin' man.

08:29.423 --> 08:33.327
I am, and me first wish
is you'll grant me health.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.096
Granted.

08:35.129 --> 08:38.232
Now, me second wish
is a small wish indeed,

08:38.265 --> 08:40.501
but it means a lot to me.

08:40.534 --> 08:43.136
I want a big crop of potatoes.

08:43.169 --> 08:44.405
Granted.

08:44.438 --> 08:48.442
And me third wish
is for the crock of gold.

08:48.476 --> 08:50.978
Granted.

09:09.897 --> 09:13.901
Now, uh, what about
your fourth wish?

09:15.169 --> 09:16.370
Me fourth wish?

09:16.403 --> 09:18.439
Try me.

09:18.472 --> 09:20.441
You'll find I'm a generous man.

09:20.474 --> 09:22.544
Then I'll be a generous man.

09:22.577 --> 09:24.546
I'd like a crock of gold
like this

09:24.579 --> 09:26.548
for me good friend Tom Kerrigan

09:26.581 --> 09:31.285
and another one
for that decent man
Pat Scanlon

09:31.318 --> 09:34.221
and another one
for that doorful
of a woman

09:34.255 --> 09:35.957
Molly Malloy.

09:35.990 --> 09:38.292
Is that your fourth wish?

09:38.325 --> 09:39.393
It is.

09:39.426 --> 09:41.228
(laughing)

09:47.535 --> 09:50.404
Three wishes I'll grant you,
great wishes or small,

09:50.437 --> 09:54.508
but you'll wish a fourth one,
and you'll lose them all!

09:54.542 --> 09:56.377
(laughing)

10:10.424 --> 10:12.426
Wasn't I the fool of the world,

10:12.459 --> 10:15.229
lettin' him trick me
into the fourth wish,

10:15.262 --> 10:16.430
and me knowin' better.

10:16.463 --> 10:18.566
Ah, dear, dear,

10:18.600 --> 10:21.368
and we could all
have been as rich
as Midas himself.

10:21.402 --> 10:23.170
A whole crock of gold for me.

10:23.204 --> 10:24.338
The devil's gold.

10:24.371 --> 10:28.242
I wouldn't touch it
if Father Murphy
blessed every coin.

10:28.275 --> 10:30.344
Stay away
from Knocknasheega, Darby.

10:30.377 --> 10:32.546
You moil and meddle
with that little king,

10:32.580 --> 10:36.183
he'll put the come hither
on you and make you
his slave forevermore.

10:36.217 --> 10:38.385
Do you think I'm a babe in arms?

10:38.419 --> 10:40.387
You are to the likes of him.

10:40.421 --> 10:42.223
5,000 years old, he is,

10:42.256 --> 10:45.226
and every year of his life
he's learned a new trick.

10:45.259 --> 10:47.461
And I've learned 100 of them.

10:47.494 --> 10:50.097
You're mad, mind you.

10:50.131 --> 10:52.266
You'll be caught
like a rat in a snap trap.

10:52.299 --> 10:54.435
Now, I don't want
your blood on my head,

10:54.468 --> 10:56.537
so don't wish any gold for me.

10:56.570 --> 11:00.775
I'll leave your share
to the Church, Paddy...

11:00.808 --> 11:04.245
(laughs) but I won't
let Father Murphy know
where I got it.

11:04.278 --> 11:05.412
No, no.

11:05.446 --> 11:07.414
(laughter)

11:13.254 --> 11:16.223
(Father Murphy)
God save all here.

11:16.257 --> 11:18.225
We didn't see you, Father.

11:18.259 --> 11:20.227
I didn't want to interrupt.

11:20.261 --> 11:22.396
I just dropped in
to tell you the news.

11:22.429 --> 11:24.431
My friend Father O'Leary
in the town of Glencove

11:24.465 --> 11:28.235
has a new bell
that was given to him
by Lord Bellinbergh,

11:28.269 --> 11:30.571
and he has presented
the old one to us.

11:30.604 --> 11:33.407
Ah, that's grand.
Glory be.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.342
There'll be a chapel bell
in our tower at last.

11:35.376 --> 11:37.411
All we have to do
is to go after it.

11:37.444 --> 11:39.446
Now, if I had a horse,
which I haven't,

11:39.480 --> 11:41.783
I'd go for it meself,
which I won't,

11:41.816 --> 11:44.185
but I thought perhaps

11:44.218 --> 11:46.587
there might be somebody here
with a horse and cart

11:46.620 --> 11:49.290
who'd like to go for the bell.

11:49.323 --> 11:52.493
How much would that somebody
be paid, Father?

11:52.526 --> 11:54.428
Paid?

11:54.461 --> 11:58.199
I suppose we might
be able to scratch up
two pounds.

11:58.232 --> 12:02.369
Now, I would have said
it was worth two pounds, ten,
if it was worth a bob.

12:02.403 --> 12:04.371
Like enough
it's worth three pounds,

12:04.405 --> 12:06.440
but since we're a poor parish,

12:06.473 --> 12:09.443
I thought perhaps
you might like to
take out the difference

12:09.476 --> 12:12.279
in the credit to your soul.

12:12.313 --> 12:14.315
Two pounds, ten, Father.

12:16.417 --> 12:19.220
Why, my goodness me,

12:19.253 --> 12:22.356
a deed like that
might even absolve a man

12:22.389 --> 12:26.193
from the sin of using
the priest and the Church

12:26.227 --> 12:31.232
against the powers of darkness
for his own selfish ends.

12:31.265 --> 12:33.801
I'll do it, Father.

12:33.835 --> 12:35.536
I'll do it for nothing.

12:35.569 --> 12:38.740
No. As a reward,

12:38.773 --> 12:42.176
you may have
the music of the bell.

12:42.209 --> 12:43.410
The music of the bell for me?

12:43.444 --> 12:45.212
Yes,

12:45.246 --> 12:47.381
and for your seed,
breed and generation

12:47.414 --> 12:49.250
till the end of time.

12:49.283 --> 12:51.318
It's a bargain, Father.

12:51.352 --> 12:53.220
I'll do it in the morning.

12:53.254 --> 12:55.189
Father!

12:55.222 --> 12:57.825
Savin' your presence,
Father Murphy, but he's
needed at the house.

12:57.859 --> 12:59.493
Excuse me, Your Reverence.

12:59.526 --> 13:01.763
Fitzpatrick himself...
Don't worry about me, girl.

13:01.796 --> 13:03.765
I'll get back.
I'm coming now.

13:03.798 --> 13:05.566
What are you after doin'
pulling me out,

13:05.599 --> 13:08.235
with Father Murphy
lookin' at us, neither?

13:08.269 --> 13:10.437
I can't afford
an army of caretakers

13:10.471 --> 13:12.539
for the little use
I have of the place,

13:12.573 --> 13:17.244
but I don't like
to see the weeds higher
than the summer house.

13:17.278 --> 13:19.246
Someone's after
poaching rabbits.

13:19.280 --> 13:22.283
Ah, that's a thing
I want you to put a stop to.

13:22.316 --> 13:25.352
Old Darby couldn't catch
a poacher if he tried.

13:25.386 --> 13:27.755
Like enough he helped
to set the snare.

13:27.789 --> 13:30.224
Now, I don't want
any bad feeling

13:30.257 --> 13:32.193
between the townspeople and me.

13:32.226 --> 13:34.528
I like 'em, mind you,
and so will you,

13:34.561 --> 13:36.430
but don't like 'em too much.

13:36.463 --> 13:38.199
No, sir.
No poachers.

13:38.232 --> 13:40.401
Well, well, well, sir.

13:40.434 --> 13:43.370
Never thought I'd have
the pleasure of seeing
Your Lordship so soon.

13:43.404 --> 13:45.773
Yes, it looks
as if you weren't
quite ready for me.

13:45.807 --> 13:48.475
One more day, and I'll have
the whole place beautified.

13:48.509 --> 13:50.411
Darby, this is Michael MacBride,

13:50.444 --> 13:51.478
a Dublin man.

13:51.512 --> 13:55.382
I've decided
to settle him here
in your place.

13:55.416 --> 13:57.418
I know it sounds sudden,

13:57.451 --> 14:00.221
but I've had it in mind
for some time.

14:00.254 --> 14:02.289
You've served me well, Darby,

14:02.323 --> 14:04.558
but we need a younger man here.

14:04.591 --> 14:08.495
When a man gets along
in years, he shouldn't
have to work so hard,

14:08.529 --> 14:10.497
so I'm going to retire you
on half pay,

14:10.531 --> 14:12.499
let you have the old
McCarthy cottage rent-free

14:12.533 --> 14:15.269
for the rest of your days.

14:15.302 --> 14:18.472
And leave the gatehouse?
It's become our home.

14:18.505 --> 14:21.242
Well, so will the other in time.

14:21.275 --> 14:23.811
I don't think Katie
will take to this.

14:23.845 --> 14:26.447
We'll give it a new thatch.

14:26.480 --> 14:30.517
But what am I
going to do with meself,
and me cut off in me prime?

14:30.551 --> 14:32.595
You'll be telling stories
at the public house all day,

14:32.619 --> 14:34.455
and poaching rabbits by night.

14:34.488 --> 14:37.324
Holy old Finbar!

14:37.358 --> 14:39.460
What with the foxes
eatin' the grouse,

14:39.493 --> 14:43.264
don't tell me I set a snare
down a rabbit hole.

14:43.297 --> 14:45.266
You're an old fox
yourself, Darby,

14:45.299 --> 14:47.368
but, faith,
I'm fond of you
and Katie, too.

14:47.401 --> 14:49.503
Whenever we have to
open up the manor house,

14:49.536 --> 14:52.206
she can have first call
with the cleaning.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.775
Pardon me, sir,
but when have we got
to leave the gatehouse?

14:54.808 --> 14:56.510
Can we give them
another two weeks?

14:56.543 --> 14:59.446
Longer than that, sir,
as far as I'm concerned.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.849
Good. Then tonight,
when you finish
today's work here,

15:01.883 --> 15:04.785
you tell Tom Kerrigan
to let you have a room
at the Rathcullen Arms.

15:04.818 --> 15:07.821
Please, sir, I'd be grateful
if you wouldn't mention it to Katie.

15:07.855 --> 15:10.457
I want to break the news
to her meself.

15:10.491 --> 15:12.359
Very well,

15:12.393 --> 15:15.296
but remember I said
two weeks, Darby,
not two years.

15:15.329 --> 15:17.464
When I return here
on Monday week,

15:17.498 --> 15:19.466
I want you out and Michael in

15:19.500 --> 15:21.936
and everything settled and done.

15:25.239 --> 15:26.340
Yes, sir.

15:29.343 --> 15:31.245
Good day, Your Lordship!

15:32.779 --> 15:35.316
Well, goodbye, Mr. O'Gill.

15:35.349 --> 15:37.418
Wouldn't it be a shame
to put his lordship

15:37.451 --> 15:39.820
to the expense
of a room in the pub

15:39.853 --> 15:42.423
and Katie and me
fair rockin' around
in the gatehouse?

15:42.456 --> 15:45.068
That's very kind
of you, but I don't think
his lordship would like it.

15:45.092 --> 15:46.560
Why wouldn't he?

15:46.593 --> 15:49.363
Sure I can instruct you
on your new duties.
Katie!

15:49.396 --> 15:50.864
Yes, Father?

15:50.898 --> 15:53.500
This is Mister, uh...
MacBride.

15:53.534 --> 15:55.512
Mr. MacBride is comin'
to stay with us for a while,

15:55.536 --> 15:58.039
so throw some extra spuds
in the pot for supper

15:58.072 --> 16:00.074
and make up the bed in the loft.

16:00.107 --> 16:02.543
If it's any trouble,
I can go to the inn.

16:02.576 --> 16:04.311
It's no trouble at all.

16:18.092 --> 16:19.460
Pony!

16:19.493 --> 16:22.796
Come with me.
What's up with you now?

16:22.829 --> 16:24.374
I want you outside
where his lordship
can have a look at you.

16:24.398 --> 16:26.400
Why should he want a look at me?

16:26.433 --> 16:28.769
'Cause you're going to be
a consequential man

16:28.802 --> 16:30.880
and have Darby's fine position
as his lordship's caretaker

16:30.904 --> 16:33.107
and Katie O'Gill for your wife.

16:33.140 --> 16:35.776
And when the sky falls,
we'll all catch larks.

16:35.809 --> 16:38.545
I mean it, Pony.
I had a talk with
his lordship about you,

16:38.579 --> 16:40.781
and I tell you
it's only a matter of time.

16:40.814 --> 16:42.816
I put a flea
in Katie's ear, too.

16:42.849 --> 16:45.086
I wouldn't worry about her.

16:45.119 --> 16:47.054
With a fine situation like that,

16:47.088 --> 16:49.490
I could have me choice of girls.

16:49.523 --> 16:52.059
Katie might help you get it.

16:52.093 --> 16:54.295
Maybe you're right.

16:54.328 --> 16:56.363
Here he comes.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.303
Smile, me darling.
Smile.

17:05.439 --> 17:07.808
This is m'lad Pony,
Your Lordship,

17:07.840 --> 17:09.476
the one I told you about.

17:09.510 --> 17:10.577
Your servant, sir.

17:10.611 --> 17:14.348
Well, he's a big man,
isn't he, now?

17:14.381 --> 17:17.417
Nice to meet you, Pony.
(clears throat)

17:17.451 --> 17:19.119
"A big man," says he.

17:19.153 --> 17:21.155
What did I tell you?

17:21.188 --> 17:23.324
You'll get the job
in no time at all.

17:29.496 --> 17:32.033
Ah, Katie, you should have saw

17:32.066 --> 17:34.501
the turf the two of us
cut this afternoon.

17:34.535 --> 17:37.771
That was a grand bit
of work you done.
So it was, aye.

17:37.804 --> 17:40.141
His lordship thought
I could use a lad

17:40.174 --> 17:42.176
to help with the turf
before the rains came.

17:42.209 --> 17:44.778
And me doin'
ten men's work already.

17:44.811 --> 17:46.813
Come, lad, sit down.

17:46.847 --> 17:48.849
Take the air of the fire,

17:48.882 --> 17:51.118
and I'll play you a tune

17:51.152 --> 17:52.819
while the pot's on the boil.

17:52.853 --> 17:54.788
(* plucks strings)

17:54.821 --> 17:56.557
Ah, that's good.

17:56.590 --> 17:59.826
(* playing lively tune)

18:03.564 --> 18:05.466
Can you put a name to that?

18:05.499 --> 18:08.502
Hmm? Uh, no, it's--
it's new to me.

18:08.535 --> 18:10.404
What's it called?

18:10.437 --> 18:13.540
Them as I heard it from
give it no name.

18:13.574 --> 18:15.409
Well, where did you hear it?

18:21.882 --> 18:25.386
In the old ruins
on the top of Knocknasheega,

18:25.419 --> 18:27.221
and there were the little people

18:27.254 --> 18:29.556
dancing all around
in the moonlight.

18:29.590 --> 18:32.559
Well, aren't they
the bold creatures?

18:32.593 --> 18:34.428
Aye, they are.

18:36.530 --> 18:38.865
Supper's ready.

18:38.899 --> 18:42.236
Bold and cunning, they are,
but I'm up to them.

18:42.269 --> 18:44.438
Once I caught
King Brian himself,

18:44.471 --> 18:47.474
and he gave me the gold,
though I'd no need for it.

18:50.444 --> 18:53.414
But, faith, I have need
for it now.

18:53.447 --> 18:55.116
Shh.

18:55.149 --> 18:56.917
(whispers)
Don't breathe a word.

19:01.555 --> 19:04.125
Tomorrow at dawn
I've got to go to Glencove

19:04.158 --> 19:06.127
to bring back a bell
for the chapel.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.229
I'll have to round up
the horse now

19:08.262 --> 19:10.397
before she runs all over
the mountainside.

19:10.431 --> 19:12.866
I'll be glad to give you a hand.

19:12.899 --> 19:15.112
I was just going to
ask you to go the rounds
of the manor house

19:15.136 --> 19:17.238
and try all the doors
and the windows.

19:17.271 --> 19:20.207
Right so, but after that,
I think I'll go down
to the Rathcullen Arms

19:20.241 --> 19:22.243
and see about a room.

19:22.276 --> 19:24.545
Now, why would you
be doin' that?

19:24.578 --> 19:27.548
I don't like
to take hospitality
under false pretenses,

19:27.581 --> 19:30.551
and besides,
two weeks from today,
you must leave here.

19:30.584 --> 19:33.220
I think your daughter
should know.
Oh, she will, she will.

19:33.254 --> 19:35.222
Then why let her believe
that I was brought here

19:35.256 --> 19:37.224
only for the cuttin'
of the turf?

19:37.258 --> 19:39.226
You see, she was born
in the gatehouse,

19:39.260 --> 19:41.395
and for 20 years,
she's lived in it.

19:41.428 --> 19:43.564
It gives us a standin'
in the town.

19:43.597 --> 19:45.566
I'll tell her
when the time comes.

19:45.599 --> 19:49.236
I can't break it
out of a clear sky
like a crack of thunder.

19:49.270 --> 19:51.472
Well, when will you tell her?

19:51.505 --> 19:54.141
The first good chance I get.
Then do it soon.

19:54.175 --> 19:55.842
I'll tell her, I'll tell her.

19:55.876 --> 19:57.944
Here. I'm used to the dark.

20:01.114 --> 20:03.150
Watch out for poachers.

20:03.184 --> 20:04.218
I'll do that.

20:15.829 --> 20:16.963
Come on now, Cleopatra.

20:19.233 --> 20:21.735
Wait now, darlin'.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.206
Devil take you!

20:25.239 --> 20:26.507
Come back here!

20:26.540 --> 20:28.041
Come back to your master.

20:28.074 --> 20:30.143
Wait till I catch you.

20:30.177 --> 20:32.179
Cleopatra, come on, now.

20:34.181 --> 20:36.783
Cleopatra, where are you?

20:36.817 --> 20:39.152
I'm lookin' for you.
Can't you hear me?

20:39.186 --> 20:40.921
Cleopatra.

21:00.207 --> 21:02.042
Ah, there you are.

21:02.075 --> 21:04.245
What do you think you're doin'?

21:04.278 --> 21:06.179
Hop out of that.
Do you want to break a leg?

21:09.350 --> 21:11.218
Whoa! Whoa, there.

21:11.252 --> 21:13.754
Whoa!
Whoa, I tell you.

21:26.267 --> 21:29.236
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, there. Whoa!

21:29.270 --> 21:31.238
Get down! Whoa!

21:31.272 --> 21:33.274
(neighing)
Get down!

21:33.307 --> 21:36.142
(screaming)

21:51.091 --> 21:52.959
So that's Darby O'Gill, is it?

21:52.993 --> 21:54.928
Aye, it is.

21:54.961 --> 21:57.864
I wonder why his honor
put the come hither
on the likes of that.

21:57.898 --> 21:59.766
Sure there's no more life in him

21:59.800 --> 22:01.968
than a potato vine
after a frost.

22:02.002 --> 22:04.571
Well, either he's hard asleep
or he's killed entirely.

22:04.605 --> 22:06.340
Let's find out.

22:14.114 --> 22:15.382
(grunts)

22:15.416 --> 22:17.217
You murtherin' little heathens!

22:17.250 --> 22:18.251
Watch your stick.

22:18.285 --> 22:20.954
Ohh! Hey! Get off me!

22:20.987 --> 22:22.222
Hey! Ooh!

22:22.255 --> 22:25.258
(both laughing)

22:25.292 --> 22:27.961
(grunting, groaning)

22:34.134 --> 22:37.304
Come on, you blackguard,
now we'll take you
to the king.

22:37.338 --> 22:40.073
There's no tellin'
what he'll do to you.

22:40.106 --> 22:41.241
No tellin' indeed.

22:41.274 --> 22:44.277
(laughs)

22:44.311 --> 22:46.246
(* bagpipes and drums playing)

22:46.279 --> 22:48.014
Come on.
Hurry up!

23:34.094 --> 23:36.430
Darby O'Gill is here.
He's come.

23:41.368 --> 23:44.037
(music stops)

23:47.173 --> 23:49.142
Come in, man.
Come in.

23:49.175 --> 23:51.378
All right, Your Royal Highness.

24:24.545 --> 24:26.447
Well, Darby O'Gill,

24:26.480 --> 24:29.382
'tis pleased
and delighted I am
to see you again.

24:29.416 --> 24:31.384
Thank you, sir.
It's a grand place
you got here.

24:31.418 --> 24:33.319
Ah, it does well enough.
Sit down, man.

24:35.422 --> 24:37.424
Over there.

24:44.565 --> 24:46.533
Drop the lid, man.

24:46.567 --> 24:50.236
It's only an old chest
full of jewels.

24:50.270 --> 24:52.205
We took it
from the Spanish ships

24:52.238 --> 24:54.240
when the armada
was wrecked on our coast.

24:54.274 --> 24:56.910
Is that so?
Ship's gun, too.

24:56.943 --> 25:00.413
Oh, that's a fine piece.

25:00.447 --> 25:01.414
It is indeed.

25:01.448 --> 25:03.917
And the throne?

25:03.950 --> 25:05.452
By all the goats in Kerry,

25:05.486 --> 25:08.421
do you think I'd sit
on a Spanish throne?

25:08.455 --> 25:11.558
This once belonged
to Fergus mac Leda,

25:11.592 --> 25:13.426
ancient high king
of all Ireland.

25:13.460 --> 25:14.895
Do you say so?

25:14.928 --> 25:17.898
I do. And over there,

25:17.931 --> 25:20.400
the gold cup of Cormac.

25:20.433 --> 25:22.435
And here's the sword
of Brian Boru,

25:22.469 --> 25:25.271
who drove out the Danes.

25:25.305 --> 25:27.407
And over there you see the harp.

25:27.440 --> 25:31.177
Don't tell me it's "the harp
that once through Tara's Hall

25:31.211 --> 25:33.246
the soul of music shed."

25:33.279 --> 25:35.315
Aye, it is that same.

25:35.348 --> 25:37.494
I declare to me soul,
when I tell them this
down in the pub,

25:37.518 --> 25:39.586
they won't believe a word of it.

25:39.620 --> 25:42.255
Ah, you can't do that, Darby.

25:42.288 --> 25:44.958
Once you're here,
there's no going back.

25:46.459 --> 25:48.261
I've got to get back to Katie.

25:48.294 --> 25:49.696
Ah, you needn't worry
about Katie.

25:49.730 --> 25:52.465
She'll give you a grand wake,
and then she'll forget
all about you.

25:52.499 --> 25:54.768
Mind what you say about Katie.

25:54.801 --> 25:56.503
Calm yourself, now.
Calm yourself!

25:56.537 --> 25:59.372
What have I
ever done to you?
Nothin', Darby.

25:59.405 --> 26:02.208
Who tells all the stories
about you?
You do, Darby.

26:02.242 --> 26:04.277
Aye, and who makes
the women watch

26:04.310 --> 26:06.279
where they're throwin'
their wash water

26:06.312 --> 26:08.515
when you and your lads
are out walkin' invisible?

26:08.549 --> 26:10.316
You do, Darby.

26:10.350 --> 26:12.786
And who makes the men
tip their hats respectful

26:12.819 --> 26:14.487
to every swirl of dust?

26:14.521 --> 26:17.558
You. You've done grand.

26:17.591 --> 26:20.226
So you put
the come hither on me.

26:20.260 --> 26:23.463
That's how you pay me back,
you ungrateful little frainey.

26:23.496 --> 26:26.466
Your heart's as cold
as a wet Christmas.

26:26.499 --> 26:28.501
(shouting)

26:30.270 --> 26:33.506
Blackguard!

26:33.540 --> 26:36.376
They better watch
what they're saying.
I speak Gaelic, too.

26:36.409 --> 26:38.979
Now, you listen to me.
No, you listen to me.

26:39.012 --> 26:42.315
Phadrig Oge was standing
under the white thorn tree
by the summer house

26:42.348 --> 26:45.418
when his lordship gave you
the bad news today,

26:45.451 --> 26:47.387
and the moment I heard
you were in trouble,

26:47.420 --> 26:49.489
I swore I'd take you out of it.

26:49.522 --> 26:52.358
If you're the fine decent man
I think you are,

26:52.392 --> 26:54.527
you'll be showin' me
a little bit of gratitude.

26:54.561 --> 26:56.229
I am grateful.

26:56.262 --> 26:58.431
Then you can say
goodbye to the tears
and the troubles

26:58.464 --> 27:00.366
of the world outside.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.402
There's nothin' but fun
and diversion here.

27:02.435 --> 27:04.437
Now, what'll you do
first, Darby?

27:04.470 --> 27:06.840
Well, I don't know.

27:06.873 --> 27:09.242
Would you care to play the harp?

27:09.275 --> 27:11.578
No, I'm no great hand
with the harp,

27:11.612 --> 27:14.214
but give me me old fiddle,

27:14.247 --> 27:16.458
and I'll play you a tune
worth goin' a mile o' ground
to hear.

27:16.482 --> 27:18.218
Grand.

27:18.251 --> 27:20.353
Now, if someone
will show me the way out,

27:20.386 --> 27:23.189
I'll go home for it.

27:23.223 --> 27:24.791
None of your tricks, Darby.

27:24.825 --> 27:28.528
I said you were here to stay.

27:28.561 --> 27:31.397
Phadrig Oge!

27:31.431 --> 27:33.299
Yes, Your Highness?

27:33.333 --> 27:34.567
Fetch the Stradivarius.

27:34.601 --> 27:36.770
Right away, Your Highness.

27:43.610 --> 27:45.445
It was presented to me

27:45.478 --> 27:48.815
by the emperor
of the Italian fairies
in 1700.

27:48.849 --> 27:51.451
It's a Stradivarius.

27:51.484 --> 27:53.286
I'd rather have me own.

27:53.319 --> 27:55.288
You'll have to make do
with this one.

27:55.321 --> 27:56.556
Go ahead, man. Try it.

27:56.589 --> 27:59.492
All right, then,
if it makes you happy.

27:59.525 --> 28:02.428
(* playing sad tune)

28:12.605 --> 28:13.439
Now give us a good one.

28:13.473 --> 28:15.408
All right, then.

28:15.441 --> 28:17.443
Me grandfather Podge told me

28:17.477 --> 28:20.146
there were three things
the little people
were mad after--

28:20.180 --> 28:24.150
dancin', whiskey and huntin'.

28:24.184 --> 28:26.352
Begorra!
He wasn't far wrong.

28:26.386 --> 28:28.488
Then I'll give you
the fox chase.

28:28.521 --> 28:30.590
(murmuring)
Ah, the fox chase.

28:30.623 --> 28:32.826
First you'll hear
the gathering of the huntsmen

28:32.859 --> 28:34.594
and the bayin' of the hounds.

28:34.627 --> 28:36.296
Grand.

28:36.329 --> 28:38.498
Away we go.
1, 2, 3, 4.

28:38.531 --> 28:41.868
(* playing lively tune)

29:22.776 --> 29:25.211
(* playing faster)

29:59.612 --> 30:01.782
(* playing faster)

30:33.613 --> 30:35.581
(* playing faster)

30:35.615 --> 30:37.283
(laughing)

31:04.845 --> 31:06.779
Ooh!

31:09.883 --> 31:12.518
(horn sounding)

31:12.552 --> 31:15.388
Gone away!

31:26.466 --> 31:28.969
(laughing)

31:41.581 --> 31:42.916
Give us full cry!

31:51.824 --> 31:54.260
(laughs)

32:08.241 --> 32:09.375
(King Brian) A-ridling!

32:21.521 --> 32:22.923
Asculf!

32:43.809 --> 32:45.111
A-ridling!

33:22.815 --> 33:24.084
Wait!

33:24.117 --> 33:25.986
Wait, Your Highness. Wait!

33:52.512 --> 33:54.780
(whinnies)

33:54.814 --> 33:56.349
Whose side are you on, anyway?

34:03.456 --> 34:06.792
You'll find out
who's the knowledgeable one.

34:06.826 --> 34:08.828
Come on, now.

34:33.219 --> 34:36.422
Oh, it's not for me.
I'm expectin' company.

34:43.496 --> 34:46.399
If I can only hold him here
till cockcrow,

34:46.431 --> 34:48.501
you'll see what'll happen
to your friend

34:48.534 --> 34:50.803
when daylight comes. Aye.

34:50.835 --> 34:52.004
(door banging)

35:02.848 --> 35:05.385
And-- And how was
the chase, hmm?

35:05.418 --> 35:07.520
We were chasin' the wrong fox,

35:07.553 --> 35:09.489
but I've run you
to earth at last.

35:09.522 --> 35:11.224
What do you mean, sir?

35:11.257 --> 35:13.059
I've a good mind
to break your back!

35:13.093 --> 35:15.095
I thought we were friends.

35:15.128 --> 35:18.564
You've made
a laughingstock of me
in front of my own people!

35:18.598 --> 35:19.832
I don't understand.

35:19.865 --> 35:23.236
When his lordship kicked
you out, who took you in?
You did.

35:23.269 --> 35:25.838
And what did you do
the minute my back
was turned?

35:25.871 --> 35:28.541
Oh, I-I just went back
for me pipe.

35:28.574 --> 35:31.844
You didn't think I wanted
to stay here, did you?

35:31.877 --> 35:35.415
How could any man
who's had one look
inside the fairy mountain

35:35.448 --> 35:37.850
be content with anything else?

35:37.883 --> 35:41.087
Faith, I never saw
dancin' so fine

35:41.121 --> 35:43.456
or heard pipin'
so shockin' sweet

35:43.489 --> 35:46.092
or touched a fiddle so grand,

35:46.126 --> 35:48.094
and never in me wildest dreams

35:48.128 --> 35:51.197
did I dream I'd be sittin'
on diamonds.

35:51.231 --> 35:55.235
No, indeed.
All I want from here
is me old dúidín.

35:55.268 --> 35:56.569
You better make sure.

35:56.602 --> 35:58.871
We can't have you goin'
in and out.

35:58.904 --> 36:00.906
No, not a thing else.

36:00.940 --> 36:03.143
I'll not even be needin' this.

36:03.176 --> 36:04.910
And what might that be, now?

36:04.944 --> 36:07.913
It's a drop of old poteen
I found in the bog.

36:07.947 --> 36:09.915
Oh, it has a real smack to it.

36:09.949 --> 36:11.917
I'd offer you a drop,

36:11.951 --> 36:14.130
only it wouldn't be fine enough
for Your Royal Highness.

36:14.154 --> 36:16.589
Let me be the judge of that.

36:16.622 --> 36:18.191
Well, very good,
Your Royal Highness.

36:38.878 --> 36:40.946
Well, here goes.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.802
Ahh.

37:02.835 --> 37:06.105
It drinks cool and easy,
so it does.

37:06.138 --> 37:08.140
I'm plenty glad you like it.

37:08.174 --> 37:09.542
Now we'd better be on our way.

37:09.575 --> 37:12.312
I can't wait to get back
to all that music

37:12.345 --> 37:13.779
and fun and diversion.

37:13.813 --> 37:16.015
Now, just a minute.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.886
We've a fine bit
of diversion right here.

37:20.920 --> 37:24.290
Sit down now
and have one with me
for friendship's sake.

37:24.324 --> 37:28.861
Well, if you insist,
Your Royal Highness...

37:28.894 --> 37:30.363
I'll join you.

37:30.396 --> 37:32.865
Good man, yourself,

37:32.898 --> 37:35.868
and if it's music
you're after,
what about a song?

37:35.901 --> 37:37.169
A song?
Aye.

37:37.203 --> 37:39.839
Do you know
the "Wishing Song"?
I do not.

37:39.872 --> 37:43.343
We better not try it, then.
You have to make it up
as you go.

37:43.376 --> 37:46.879
(laughs) I can make up
a thousand songs,
so I can.

37:46.912 --> 37:48.814
Can you?

37:48.848 --> 37:49.815
Of course I can.

37:49.849 --> 37:51.217
All right, then.

37:51.251 --> 37:53.886
The "Wishing Song."

37:53.919 --> 37:58.224
* Oh, I wish I had time
to sing you a song

37:58.258 --> 38:01.827
* But when I get started,
I sing all night long

38:01.861 --> 38:03.095
(laughs)

38:03.128 --> 38:06.332
Can you put a rhyme to that?

38:06.366 --> 38:09.235
Try me.
Go on, then.

38:09.269 --> 38:12.872
* Oh, singin's no sin
and drinkin's no crime

38:12.905 --> 38:16.208
* If you have one drink only,
just one at a time

38:16.242 --> 38:20.145
(laughs)

38:23.816 --> 38:27.753
* Oh, I wish all the rhymers
were like Brian Connors

38:27.787 --> 38:32.758
* When it comes to rhymin',
he takes all the honors

38:32.792 --> 38:34.760
(laughing)

38:36.796 --> 38:39.131
(laughs)

38:41.267 --> 38:42.402
Can you beat that?

38:42.435 --> 38:45.237
Hold your whisht.

38:45.271 --> 38:48.808
* Oh, I knew you could sing
when you opened your mug

38:48.841 --> 38:52.412
* So you carry the tune
and I'll carry the jug

38:52.445 --> 38:53.813
That's a good one.

38:55.848 --> 38:57.417
Could we have another round?

38:57.450 --> 39:00.886
There's nothin'
stoppin' us.
Good.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.923
* Oh, I wish all barmaids

39:03.956 --> 39:05.758
* Were like Mary McCluskey

39:05.791 --> 39:07.259
"McCluskey"?

39:07.293 --> 39:09.295
* When she served you a drink

39:09.329 --> 39:11.897
* Why, she served you
good "whuskey"

39:11.931 --> 39:14.834
(laughing)

39:14.867 --> 39:16.902
Oh, that's
a thunderin' good rhyme,

39:16.936 --> 39:18.838
"McCluskey" and "whuskey."

39:18.871 --> 39:22.174
Did you ever hear
the like of it?

39:22.207 --> 39:26.912
* But Mary, she married
poor Jimmy McQueen

39:26.946 --> 39:31.150
* 'Cause she wanted her name
to rhyme with "poteen"

39:36.456 --> 39:38.458
Oh, I've got a good one.

39:38.491 --> 39:40.460
So have I.

39:40.493 --> 39:45.465
* Oh, I wish I was married
to old Widow Tunney

39:45.498 --> 39:49.835
* She's ugly as sin
but has beautiful money

39:53.238 --> 39:54.440
Sláinte, lad.

39:54.474 --> 39:57.242
Sláinte go saol agat.

40:03.516 --> 40:05.385
(laughing)

40:05.418 --> 40:07.853
(groaning)

40:19.999 --> 40:22.034
(snores)

40:30.376 --> 40:33.112
(* humming the "Wishing Song")

40:42.388 --> 40:44.189
How many verses have we sung?

40:44.223 --> 40:45.324
79.

40:45.357 --> 40:48.428
Well, here's the 80th for you.

40:48.461 --> 40:53.899
* Oh, I wish that all mortals
were like my friend Darby

40:53.933 --> 40:56.536
* He's full of poteen,
but he's fuller of blarney

40:56.569 --> 41:00.906
(laughing)

41:00.940 --> 41:03.342
That's a tough one.

41:03.375 --> 41:05.411
Well, here's 81.

41:05.445 --> 41:08.514
Ha. Ha. Ugh.

41:08.548 --> 41:12.284
* I wish all the gentry
were like the King Brian

41:12.317 --> 41:14.420
* If he can't beat ya drinkin',

41:14.454 --> 41:16.889
* He'll fall down a-tryin'

41:16.922 --> 41:18.390
(both laughing)

41:19.459 --> 41:21.461
(rooster crows)

41:21.494 --> 41:24.430
(laughing)

41:26.966 --> 41:28.968
Good mornin', me old bucko.

41:39.945 --> 41:42.381
Open your door.

41:42.414 --> 41:45.918
Can you not go
through it anymore?
Try again.

41:45.951 --> 41:50.490
Would you violate
the sacred rites
of hospitality?
I would.

41:50.523 --> 41:52.601
How would you like
to have me put a hump
on your back?

41:52.625 --> 41:55.394
I know you can't work
your charms in the daytime,

41:55.427 --> 41:58.263
and when you couldn't go
through that door,
I knew I had you.

41:58.297 --> 42:01.934
You murderin', deceitful,
blind-staggerin'
old truaillidh móran!

42:01.967 --> 42:03.969
When me strength comes back
in the nighttime,

42:04.003 --> 42:06.347
I'll put an elephant's head
on you and have you crawl
on all fours

42:06.371 --> 42:08.440
and eat grass
that won't nourish you

42:08.474 --> 42:10.442
till you shrivel up and die!

42:10.476 --> 42:13.979
Whoo-hoo, hullabaloo.

42:14.013 --> 42:15.481
(cat meows)

42:15.515 --> 42:17.583
Ah, good mornin', Ginger.

42:17.617 --> 42:19.485
Have you come
for your breakfast?

42:19.519 --> 42:23.255
Well, there's a tasty morsel
I've no further use for.

42:23.288 --> 42:24.990
Don't let him loose.

42:25.024 --> 42:27.126
Don't let him loose!

42:33.499 --> 42:35.467
Shrivel him up.
Put a hump in his back.

42:35.501 --> 42:37.436
Have mercy, Darby.

42:37.469 --> 42:41.173
Spare me and I'll grant you
your three wishes
all over again!

42:41.206 --> 42:43.308
Do you hear that, Ginger?

42:43.342 --> 42:44.476
Now, go on, wish them.

42:44.510 --> 42:47.346
Sure now, I might wish
for the crock of gold.

42:47.379 --> 42:49.214
Go on!

42:49.248 --> 42:51.216
Or I might wish
for-- let's see--

42:51.250 --> 42:53.285
long life.
Yes.

42:53.318 --> 42:56.556
Or I might wish
for a carriage and pair.

42:56.589 --> 42:57.489
Granted. Granted.

42:57.523 --> 42:59.491
(Ginger meowing)

42:59.525 --> 43:01.226
Granted.

43:01.260 --> 43:02.500
But I haven't wished a wish yet.

43:02.528 --> 43:04.229
I said I might.

43:04.263 --> 43:05.565
Get on with it, then.

43:05.598 --> 43:07.533
Wish your wishes,

43:07.567 --> 43:10.335
and since we've had
such a grand night of it,

43:10.369 --> 43:12.371
you can have
as many as you like.

43:12.404 --> 43:14.406
So that's good of you.

43:14.439 --> 43:18.310
"Three wishes I'll grant you,
big wishes and small,

43:18.343 --> 43:20.546
but if you wish a fourth,
you'll get none at all."

43:20.580 --> 43:22.815
(laughing)

43:22.848 --> 43:26.251
Ah, what a memory you've got,
you wicked old scut.

43:26.285 --> 43:27.386
(laughs)

43:27.419 --> 43:30.756
But before I make a wish,
I'll have to talk with Katie.

43:30.790 --> 43:32.324
I'll make one.

43:32.357 --> 43:33.525
Go on, go on.

43:33.559 --> 43:35.761
One wish to protect
the other two.

43:35.795 --> 43:40.499
Now, me first wish is
that you will not fly back
to Knocknasheega,

43:40.532 --> 43:44.236
but you'll be
at my beck and call
for a fortnight at least,

43:44.269 --> 43:46.405
until I make
the other two wishes.

43:46.438 --> 43:48.574
You thief of the world.

43:48.608 --> 43:52.377
Never in 1,000 years
has a man taken such
an underhanded advantage.

43:52.411 --> 43:55.414
Faith, never in 5,000 years
have you ever met

43:55.447 --> 43:58.383
a more knowledgeable adversary.

43:58.417 --> 44:00.519
I am Brian of Knocknasheega,

44:00.552 --> 44:03.288
and never-- No! No!

44:03.322 --> 44:05.524
Do you agree to the terms
of the first wish?

44:05.557 --> 44:07.292
I do, I do!

44:07.326 --> 44:09.795
All right, then.
Go on, Ginger.

44:09.829 --> 44:12.865
But how am I gonna
protect myself while
you're makin' up your mind?

44:12.898 --> 44:15.234
Now, don't worry.

44:15.267 --> 44:17.569
I'll take good care of you.

44:17.603 --> 44:20.305
Aah!

44:20.339 --> 44:22.274
No, no, no,
you wicked old devil.

44:22.307 --> 44:23.575
You murderin' old hypocrite!

44:23.609 --> 44:25.811
Let me go! Let me out!

44:25.845 --> 44:27.346
Let me out, do you hear me?

44:57.877 --> 45:00.445
Now, what would she
be doin' around here?

45:00.479 --> 45:02.581
Always scrougin' round
to the back door,

45:02.614 --> 45:04.449
beggin' something,
borrowin' tea or something.

45:07.619 --> 45:09.321
Morning.

45:09.354 --> 45:11.256
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?

45:11.290 --> 45:14.459
That I did, thank you.
Where's Darby?

45:14.493 --> 45:17.429
His bed hasn't been slept in,
but he'll turn up.

45:17.462 --> 45:20.332
I gathered from something
he said last night

45:20.365 --> 45:22.768
that he might capture
the leprechaun.

45:22.802 --> 45:24.536
He has great games with them.

45:24.569 --> 45:26.471
When he's taken
a draft too many?

45:26.505 --> 45:28.507
He's not a drinkin' man.

45:31.844 --> 45:34.279
But he's a lonely man
since me mother died.

45:34.313 --> 45:36.448
When he goes to the pub,
it's for company,

45:36.481 --> 45:38.483
and when he makes
his rounds at night,

45:38.517 --> 45:40.519
the wee folk give him sport.

45:40.552 --> 45:42.487
Well, what about yourself?

45:42.521 --> 45:44.356
Don't you get lonely?

45:46.258 --> 45:47.793
I keep busy.

45:47.827 --> 45:49.795
Rathcullen's
a small, little place,

45:49.829 --> 45:52.231
but there are dances
and hostings aplenty.

45:53.833 --> 45:55.500
There's a dance on tonight.

45:55.534 --> 45:58.537
Maybe you'd care to go,
Mr. MacBride?

45:58.570 --> 46:00.572
No, not yet, thank you.

46:00.605 --> 46:04.343
And, uh, by the way,
my name is Michael.

46:04.376 --> 46:05.510
Well, so it is,

46:05.544 --> 46:08.347
but until I've known you
more than a day,

46:08.380 --> 46:11.884
your name is Mr. MacBride...
Mr. MacBride.

46:13.418 --> 46:16.521
What was old Sheelah
doin' around here?

46:16.555 --> 46:19.224
She dropped in
to pay back a pinch of tea.

46:19.258 --> 46:20.568
I don't like to see her
about the place.

46:20.592 --> 46:22.561
Father, sit down and eat.

46:22.594 --> 46:25.430
She and Pony, they're two
of a kind, neither of them
up to any good.

46:25.464 --> 46:27.432
She's only a poor old woman.

46:27.466 --> 46:30.836
Old woman indeed.
Are you wearin'
your holy medal?

46:30.870 --> 46:33.405
I am.
Well, don't leave it off.

46:33.438 --> 46:35.574
She could be a witch.

46:35.607 --> 46:38.243
You'd better go to bed.

46:38.277 --> 46:41.280
I can't. I got to go
to Glencove

46:41.313 --> 46:43.215
to pick up a bell
for Father Murphy.

46:46.585 --> 46:48.854
'Tis a shame I'll not
be here today to help you.

46:48.888 --> 46:51.456
Oh, we can't let
the cutting of the turf

46:51.490 --> 46:53.458
stand in the way of good deeds.

46:53.492 --> 46:55.560
Well, me boy, seein' it's
for one day only,

46:55.594 --> 46:58.230
could you leave the turf

46:58.263 --> 46:59.932
and cut the weeds
around the summer house?

47:01.600 --> 47:03.769
I think I could.

47:03.803 --> 47:07.372
And, listen, if you
make a good job of it,
I might keep you on.

47:07.406 --> 47:09.574
How would you like workin'
for me, anyway?

47:09.608 --> 47:11.576
Why would he want
to work for you?

47:11.610 --> 47:13.578
You haven't one shilling
to rub against the other.

47:13.612 --> 47:20.485
Katie, me dear, there's been
a change in our fortunes
for the better.

47:20.519 --> 47:24.323
I'm thinkin' of buyin'
the manor house for meself

47:24.356 --> 47:26.591
and shiftin' you out of here
into surroundin's

47:26.625 --> 47:29.228
more in keepin'
with your charm and beauty.

47:29.261 --> 47:31.496
I wouldn't want to live
in the manor house.

47:31.530 --> 47:34.333
You know as well as I do
his lordship would never
sell it.

47:34.366 --> 47:36.501
What do you want?
You've only got to name it.

47:36.535 --> 47:38.470
I don't want anything.
Now, sit down.

47:38.503 --> 47:40.772
I suppose you don't want to hear

47:40.806 --> 47:43.508
about the great battle
I fought with the powers
of darkness.

47:43.542 --> 47:46.778
I do not. Now, sit down
and eat your stirabout.

47:51.851 --> 47:54.820
She should be the caretaker.

47:54.854 --> 47:57.789
She's got a tongue
would clip a hedge.

48:01.526 --> 48:04.263
(Michael) * Have you ever
seen the sea gulls

48:04.296 --> 48:06.866
* A-flyin' o'er the heather

48:06.899 --> 48:09.801
* Or the crimson sails
in Galway Bay

48:09.835 --> 48:12.771
* The fishermen unfurl

48:12.804 --> 48:15.807
* Oh, the earth is filled
with beauty

48:15.841 --> 48:18.878
* And it's gathered all together

48:18.911 --> 48:21.881
* In the form and face
and dainty grace

48:21.914 --> 48:26.285
* Of a pretty Irish girl

48:26.318 --> 48:28.820
* Oh, she is my dear,
my darlin' one

48:28.854 --> 48:31.390
* Her eyes so sparklin'
full of fun

48:31.423 --> 48:35.394
* No other, no other
can match the likes of her

48:35.427 --> 48:36.828
* She is my dear, my darlin' one

48:36.862 --> 48:39.831
* My smilin' and beguilin' one

48:39.865 --> 48:43.568
* I love the ground
she walks upon

48:43.602 --> 48:47.406
* My darling Irish girl

48:47.439 --> 48:50.876
I called you when your food
was ready, but you were
makin' so much noise,

48:50.910 --> 48:52.544
you couldn't hear me.

48:52.577 --> 48:54.513
Faith, I know
I can't sing a lick,

48:54.546 --> 48:56.515
but when I'm roarin'
like Doran's bull,

48:56.548 --> 48:58.517
it works up
a killin' hunger in me.

48:58.550 --> 49:00.052
What have we got here?

49:00.085 --> 49:02.054
Bread newly baked,
butter fresh
from the churn,

49:02.087 --> 49:03.755
and boiled eggs and ham.

49:03.788 --> 49:05.290
Well, now, aren't you
the clever girl?

49:06.558 --> 49:08.827
You have enough here
to feed the parish.

49:08.860 --> 49:11.363
I thought you'd be hungry.

49:11.396 --> 49:13.432
I hope the bread has cooled.

49:13.465 --> 49:15.400
Oh, I like it hot.
Míle murder!

49:15.434 --> 49:17.569
Did no one ever tell you
the hazard of hot bread?

49:17.602 --> 49:19.104
No, they didn't.

49:19.138 --> 49:22.574
Sure you can see I need someone
to watch over me.

49:22.607 --> 49:26.411
Did your father say anything
this morning before he left?

49:26.445 --> 49:27.846
He said he would be back
by sundown.

49:27.879 --> 49:29.915
Nothin' about me?

49:29.949 --> 49:32.417
He said you were a good lad.

49:32.451 --> 49:33.852
That's all?

49:33.885 --> 49:35.054
Isn't that enough?

49:35.087 --> 49:38.357
I suppose it is.

49:38.390 --> 49:40.926
Tell me, Katie,
do yo think I'm a good lad?

49:42.427 --> 49:44.429
I very greatly doubt it.

49:52.837 --> 49:55.941
(bell chiming)

50:10.422 --> 50:12.457
(cheering)

50:29.841 --> 50:32.777
(shouts in Gaelic)

50:32.811 --> 50:36.781
Hey, all right!

50:36.815 --> 50:37.916
It's a grand bell.

50:37.949 --> 50:40.785
You've done a great deed.

50:40.819 --> 50:43.355
Thank you, Father.
Thank you, Father.

50:45.557 --> 50:46.557
Darby!

50:49.628 --> 50:51.830
What have you got in the bag?

50:51.863 --> 50:53.532
Well, uh, Father,

50:53.565 --> 50:55.934
it would be a hard thing
to explain.

50:55.967 --> 50:58.437
Oh, now, you could try.

50:58.470 --> 51:01.840
Well, like, it's a kind
of financial venture,
you might say.

51:01.873 --> 51:05.144
A financial venture
that you'd be afraid
to tell your priest about?

51:05.177 --> 51:06.511
Oh, no, no, no.

51:06.545 --> 51:09.048
Sure I'm on the side
of the angels,

51:09.081 --> 51:11.883
against the powers of darkness.

51:11.916 --> 51:14.819
What would you say,
Father, if I told you

51:14.853 --> 51:17.522
I captured the king
of the little people?

51:17.556 --> 51:20.059
I'd say you had imagined it.

51:20.092 --> 51:21.893
(laughs)

51:21.926 --> 51:24.796
Then I've nothin' at all
in the bag here, Reverend.

51:24.829 --> 51:26.865
Nothin' at all.

51:26.898 --> 51:29.868
(laughing)

51:29.901 --> 51:31.836
(cheering)

51:37.609 --> 51:40.212
Glory be to the saints of joy.

51:40.245 --> 51:42.547
This is a great day
for Rathcullen.

51:42.581 --> 51:45.384
You've certainly earned
a glass of stout, Darby.

51:45.417 --> 51:47.852
Aye, it's dry work
cartin' a bell.

51:47.886 --> 51:51.223
May we all live to see--

51:51.256 --> 51:53.758
Would a toast be a kind of wish?

51:53.792 --> 51:54.893
It would.

51:54.926 --> 51:56.761
Oh, well, then,

51:56.795 --> 51:58.930
devil a toast
will I drink this day.

52:03.902 --> 52:05.237
What's in there?

52:07.872 --> 52:10.175
The renowned Brian Connors,

52:10.209 --> 52:12.211
king of all the leprechauns.

52:12.244 --> 52:14.579
One wish I wished already,

52:14.613 --> 52:17.282
but I'm not lettin' him
out of this bag

52:17.316 --> 52:19.584
until I've wished the other two.

52:19.618 --> 52:22.854
What does he look like, Darby?

52:22.887 --> 52:26.558
Ah, just a teeny-weeny
tawny little atom-y
kind of gentleman

52:26.591 --> 52:28.760
with a beard on his face

52:28.793 --> 52:33.232
and a crown like a fistful
of horns on his head.

52:33.265 --> 52:34.766
Let's have a look at him.

52:34.799 --> 52:37.236
Let's have a look
at the little gentleman.

52:37.269 --> 52:38.770
Oh, never mind, then.

52:38.803 --> 52:40.905
Sure it's only
Lady Fitzpatrick's prize hen,

52:40.939 --> 52:43.808
the one they gave
the red ribbon to
at the fair.

52:43.842 --> 52:48.147
(imitating chickens clucking)

52:53.818 --> 52:55.554
Fill the little pannikin--

52:55.587 --> 52:58.157
20 year old,
the best in the house.

52:58.190 --> 53:00.192
I will, Darby.

53:13.205 --> 53:14.906
Thank you.

53:14.939 --> 53:17.209
Here you are, Your Majesty.

53:19.844 --> 53:22.214
(gulping noise)

53:30.955 --> 53:32.524
(King Brian) Ahh.

53:59.251 --> 54:01.220
Did you see that?

54:01.253 --> 54:03.822
I saw it with me own two eyes.

54:03.855 --> 54:05.324
Give me the glass, Tom.

54:09.361 --> 54:12.897
That's a story
will bear repeatin'.

54:15.934 --> 54:18.903
And if any man doubts
the truth of it,

54:18.937 --> 54:22.574
there's the very same glass.

54:22.607 --> 54:25.244
* Bum-ba-dum-ba-da-da-dee-dee

54:25.277 --> 54:27.846
* Da-dum-ba-da-da-da-dun

54:27.879 --> 54:30.081
* When the dew is on the hayrick

54:30.114 --> 54:32.817
* And every drop a pearl

54:32.851 --> 54:35.754
* When the geese
are full of blarney

54:35.787 --> 54:38.223
* And the thrush
is singing Gaelic

54:38.257 --> 54:41.260
* And standing in the doorway

54:41.293 --> 54:45.364
* Is a pretty Irish girl

54:45.397 --> 54:46.931
* Oh, she is my dear,
my darling one

54:46.965 --> 54:49.167
* Her eyes so sparkling
full of fun

54:49.200 --> 54:53.272
* No other, no other
can match the likes of her

54:53.305 --> 54:55.407
* She is my dear, my darling one

54:55.440 --> 54:57.842
* My smilin' and beguilin' one

54:57.876 --> 54:59.878
* I love the ground
she walks upon...

54:59.911 --> 55:02.914
Now, where did you
hear that?
Michael was singin' it.

55:02.947 --> 55:05.083
* My pretty Irish girl

55:06.285 --> 55:08.887
Where are you off to?
To a dance.

55:08.920 --> 55:11.122
With Michael?

55:11.155 --> 55:13.792
No. Michael's goin'
your rounds for you.

55:13.825 --> 55:15.760
He is?

55:15.794 --> 55:17.896
Why'd he do that?

55:17.929 --> 55:19.898
Well, he said you were
worried about the poachers.

55:19.931 --> 55:22.100
If I hurry,
I'll catch up with him.

55:33.912 --> 55:35.814
Ah, the devil take you!

55:35.847 --> 55:37.316
Darby.

55:37.349 --> 55:38.917
What ails you, lad?
Is it blind you are?

55:38.950 --> 55:40.919
I am indeed.

55:40.952 --> 55:43.922
Sure when I saw man running
in the dark with a game bag
in his hand,

55:43.955 --> 55:45.933
wasn't I the foolish one
to mistake him for a poacher?

55:45.957 --> 55:48.327
By the hokey, it did look bad.

55:48.360 --> 55:50.295
Will you forgive me?

55:50.329 --> 55:53.898
Faith, a stepmother
wouldn't blame ye.

55:53.932 --> 55:56.167
No harm done.

55:56.200 --> 55:58.837
I'm sorry, but I promised
his lordship there'd be
no poaching,

55:58.870 --> 56:01.239
and I can't make an exception,
not even for you,

56:01.272 --> 56:02.350
so you'll have to
let the rabbit go.

56:02.374 --> 56:05.176
Rabbit indeed.
(laughing)

56:08.947 --> 56:11.249
I didn't intend to show him yet,

56:11.282 --> 56:13.251
but you've been a nice fella.

56:13.284 --> 56:14.919
I'll give you the first look.

56:14.953 --> 56:16.955
Bring him over here.
Come on.

56:18.957 --> 56:22.427
Get ready
for the grand surprise.

56:22.461 --> 56:24.996
It's no rabbit.

56:27.466 --> 56:30.869
Rabbit or hare,
what's the odds?
Rabbit or hare?

56:30.902 --> 56:33.448
You're lookin' at Brian
of Knocknasheega, king
of all the leprechauns.

56:33.472 --> 56:35.374
'Twas a rabbit I saw.

56:35.407 --> 56:37.409
Have another look.

56:44.416 --> 56:47.085
It's still a rabbit.

56:57.529 --> 56:59.498
Try closin' one eye.

56:59.531 --> 57:01.900
Closing one eye?

57:07.406 --> 57:09.541
Ah, you've had a hard day today,

57:09.574 --> 57:12.243
and a hard night last night.

57:12.276 --> 57:14.479
Now, why don't you
go home to bed
and get a good rest?

57:14.513 --> 57:16.415
How could I rest,

57:16.448 --> 57:19.250
and you thinkin' I'm a poacher?

57:21.252 --> 57:23.388
They take different shapes,
you know.

57:23.422 --> 57:24.523
So I hear.

57:24.556 --> 57:27.426
Aye, you ought to see him
with his little gold crown

57:27.459 --> 57:29.360
and his red beard

57:29.394 --> 57:32.397
and his two eyes leapin'
from his head like flames.

57:32.431 --> 57:34.933
I wish you could see him.
Granted.

57:34.966 --> 57:37.569
And that's your second wish.

57:37.602 --> 57:41.406
Why, you tricky, deceivin',
connivin', double-dealin',
high-handed--

57:41.440 --> 57:43.508
Oh, wirra, wirra, wirra.

57:43.542 --> 57:46.210
That's what comes of a man
not yet threescore and ten

57:46.244 --> 57:51.583
matchin' his wits against
an intellectual gladiator
5,000 years old.

57:51.616 --> 57:53.585
Well, I still have
me third wish left,

57:53.618 --> 57:55.454
and maybe me second one's
not all wasted.

57:55.487 --> 57:57.556
Now, go on. Make yourself
visible to him.

57:57.589 --> 58:00.124
But I am visible to him.

58:00.158 --> 58:03.394
You wished he should see me,
and see me he does.

58:03.428 --> 58:06.230
He sees me as a rabbit.

58:06.264 --> 58:08.366
You're a cheat
and you're a liar.

58:08.399 --> 58:11.470
Don't tell me
you can't hear him.

58:11.503 --> 58:14.238
I'm afraid I can't.

58:14.272 --> 58:16.307
What's the world comin' to?

58:16.340 --> 58:18.543
I could have knocked
a crock of gold

58:18.577 --> 58:21.245
out of this old chancer
with that second wish,

58:21.279 --> 58:24.783
but I gave it all up
for a man who can
neither hear nor see.

58:24.816 --> 58:28.386
Darby, he can see me
as I really am...

58:28.419 --> 58:30.354
in his dreams tonight.

58:31.490 --> 58:35.460
You can see him tonight
in your dreams.

58:35.494 --> 58:37.228
Are you sure?

58:37.261 --> 58:39.764
I am.

58:39.798 --> 58:41.265
He promised me.

58:50.809 --> 58:53.411
Ah, the last reel
was the best one.

58:53.444 --> 58:55.480
You know, Katie,
you're so light
on your feet,

58:55.514 --> 58:57.982
you could tread on cobwebs
without breaking them.

58:58.016 --> 59:00.251
Thank you, Sean.
May I take you home now?

59:00.284 --> 59:02.821
No need to trouble yourself.
Katie can ride home with me.

59:02.854 --> 59:05.456
I think--
Can't she?

59:05.490 --> 59:07.458
That'll be grand, Pony.

59:07.492 --> 59:09.794
Good night, Sean.

59:09.828 --> 59:11.496
Good night, Katie.

59:16.535 --> 59:19.137
(clicks tongue)
Come on. Hup! Hup!

59:34.318 --> 59:36.521
Thank you for the ride.

59:36.555 --> 59:38.056
Good night, Pony.

59:44.262 --> 59:47.532
Have you no pride,
ridin' home with
the like of that?

59:47.566 --> 59:51.302
He was only bein' civil
to me, and I was no more
than civil to him.

59:51.335 --> 59:53.271
Well, you'd better forget
about him altogether.

59:54.539 --> 59:57.241
Well, maybe I will

59:57.275 --> 01:00:00.211
when me father stops
spyin' on me at windows.

01:00:00.244 --> 01:00:01.345
Oh, tare and ages!

01:00:01.379 --> 01:00:04.482
Isn't that a nice way
for a girl to talk
to her father?

01:00:04.515 --> 01:00:06.551
And she me one and only.

01:00:06.585 --> 01:00:09.387
She's a fine girl, Katie,
but she's in mortal danger.

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.522
How do you mean that?

01:00:11.556 --> 01:00:14.425
'Tis you, the way
you're dillydallyin'
with your wishes.

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:17.228
Phadrig Oge, he's me lieutenant.

01:00:17.261 --> 01:00:19.397
He'll stop at nothin'
till he gets me back.

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:21.566
He might even put
the come hither on Katie,

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.835
so's you would have to
wish her free again.

01:00:23.868 --> 01:00:26.337
If he lays a finger on Katie,

01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:28.272
I'll kill you dead
and murder you entirely.

01:00:28.306 --> 01:00:30.274
Tell your Phadrig Oge that!

01:00:30.308 --> 01:00:32.877
Tell him?
How can I give the order,
and me tied up in a sack?

01:00:32.911 --> 01:00:35.446
I'll throw you in the river
and drown you like a kitten.

01:00:35.479 --> 01:00:37.582
Do that, and you'll
have a scourge

01:00:37.616 --> 01:00:39.856
that'll make
the potato famine look
like a Sunday regatta.

01:00:39.884 --> 01:00:42.353
Don't you threaten me.

01:00:42.386 --> 01:00:44.388
Your cows will die
of the black leg

01:00:44.422 --> 01:00:46.457
and your sheep of the red water,

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:50.194
and in every cradle in town
there'll be a changeling!

01:00:50.228 --> 01:00:52.563
I'm not afraid of you.

01:00:52.597 --> 01:00:54.265
You'd better be.

01:00:54.298 --> 01:00:56.768
I'm the one that keeps
my kingdom in order,

01:00:56.801 --> 01:00:59.570
and all the unpleasant
spirits of the night
will run wild

01:00:59.604 --> 01:01:02.406
unless you wish your wish
and let me go.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.876
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to wish for.

01:01:04.909 --> 01:01:07.311
Then, uh, wish for the gold.

01:01:07.345 --> 01:01:10.481
I'll give it to you this time.

01:01:10.514 --> 01:01:13.451
Ah, she doesn't want the gold
nor the manor house, neither.

01:01:13.484 --> 01:01:14.485
Who doesn't?

01:01:14.518 --> 01:01:16.788
Katie I'm thinkin' of.

01:01:16.821 --> 01:01:19.457
Well, uh, what does she want?

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:21.259
I don't know.

01:01:21.292 --> 01:01:23.461
We were happy here,
the two of us,

01:01:23.494 --> 01:01:25.329
but when I catch her
dancin' and whirligiggin'

01:01:25.363 --> 01:01:28.232
with a drunken blatherumskite
like Pony Sugrue,

01:01:28.266 --> 01:01:30.301
well, I don't know her at all.

01:01:30.334 --> 01:01:32.403
Ah, she needs to settle her mind

01:01:32.436 --> 01:01:34.438
on a good steady lad
with temperate ways.

01:01:34.472 --> 01:01:35.573
That she does.

01:01:35.606 --> 01:01:38.777
What if she found such a lad
and fell in love with him,

01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:40.411
and he with her?

01:01:40.444 --> 01:01:42.346
Would you wish your wish then?

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.815
I would.

01:01:43.848 --> 01:01:46.584
Good. Now, go to bed,
have a good sleep.

01:01:46.617 --> 01:01:48.586
Leave all to me.

01:01:48.619 --> 01:01:50.354
Put your mind at rest.

01:01:57.862 --> 01:01:59.163
Michael.

01:02:00.564 --> 01:02:02.433
Michael.

01:02:02.466 --> 01:02:04.602
What do you want?

01:02:04.635 --> 01:02:06.771
I said I'd visit your dreams,

01:02:06.805 --> 01:02:09.373
and when I make a promise,
I keep it.

01:02:09.407 --> 01:02:11.810
Well, I've seen you.
Now go away.

01:02:11.843 --> 01:02:14.378
Ah, but I...

01:02:14.412 --> 01:02:17.215
I'd like to talk about Katie.

01:02:17.248 --> 01:02:19.283
How does she concern you?

01:02:19.317 --> 01:02:21.319
She's the one
that's keepin' me here.

01:02:21.352 --> 01:02:24.823
Darby won't wish any more wishes
until his girl is pleased.

01:02:24.856 --> 01:02:27.525
Well, what can I do about it?

01:02:27.558 --> 01:02:31.830
Marry her, and you can
all live here as happy
as three peas in a pod.

01:02:31.863 --> 01:02:33.564
I hardly know the girl.

01:02:33.597 --> 01:02:36.334
One look at her
and you'll know her.

01:02:36.367 --> 01:02:40.304
She's a nice girl
and I like her, but--

01:02:40.338 --> 01:02:42.340
Good. Then next Sunday
after Mass,

01:02:42.373 --> 01:02:44.843
take her up to the ruins
on the top of Knocknasheega.

01:02:44.876 --> 01:02:46.845
'Tis a fine romantic view
from there.

01:02:46.878 --> 01:02:49.413
Just lookin' down
will make any girl so dizzy,

01:02:49.447 --> 01:02:51.549
she'll fall into your arms.

01:02:51.582 --> 01:02:54.285
I don't want her
to fall into my arms.

01:02:57.421 --> 01:03:02.393
But then, of course,
I can't very well blame you.

01:03:02.426 --> 01:03:04.763
Might mean
gettin' your head broken.

01:03:04.796 --> 01:03:07.866
I know if I was courtin'
Pony Sugrue's girl,

01:03:07.899 --> 01:03:10.434
I'd be afraid, too.

01:03:10.468 --> 01:03:12.370
Is it puttin' the coward's name
on me you are?

01:03:12.403 --> 01:03:13.872
Ah, no, no, no.

01:03:13.905 --> 01:03:15.573
No, no. Go to sleep now.

01:03:15.606 --> 01:03:17.776
Go to sleep.

01:03:17.809 --> 01:03:18.843
Good lad.

01:03:18.877 --> 01:03:21.479
Go to sleep.

01:03:25.884 --> 01:03:27.218
Katie.

01:03:29.821 --> 01:03:32.256
Katie.

01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:33.792
I say, Katie.

01:03:33.825 --> 01:03:37.361
He's a fine strong lad
with temperate ways.

01:03:37.395 --> 01:03:38.763
Hmm?

01:03:40.331 --> 01:03:43.802
Michael is a fine strong lad
with temperate ways.

01:03:43.835 --> 01:03:47.271
He'd make you a grand husband.

01:03:47.305 --> 01:03:49.808
I don't want a husband.
Not yet.

01:03:49.841 --> 01:03:50.775
Not yet?

01:03:50.809 --> 01:03:52.376
Oh, Katie,

01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:53.878
many a girl
has spoke these words

01:03:53.912 --> 01:03:55.914
and lived to rue them.

01:03:55.947 --> 01:03:58.249
You know, when a girl is 20,

01:03:58.282 --> 01:04:00.451
her boy will marry her up
in a minute,

01:04:00.484 --> 01:04:02.420
but when she's 30,
doesn't she have a time

01:04:02.453 --> 01:04:04.455
trying to make him say
the hard word?

01:04:04.488 --> 01:04:06.424
I'll have me courtship first.

01:04:06.457 --> 01:04:08.259
Courtship, is it?

01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:10.594
And marriage the bone
and sinew of the country?

01:04:10.628 --> 01:04:13.497
What would you call a girl
who'd keep her lad dangling

01:04:13.531 --> 01:04:16.901
through pure selfishness
or sinful dalliance?

01:04:16.935 --> 01:04:19.237
I know what I'd call her.
I'd call her--

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:20.338
I'd--

01:04:30.849 --> 01:04:33.251
Katie.

01:04:33.284 --> 01:04:35.820
Katie.

01:04:35.854 --> 01:04:38.823
(whispers) Yes?

01:04:38.857 --> 01:04:41.492
I returned
as a matter of courtesy

01:04:41.525 --> 01:04:44.262
to give you the last word.

01:04:44.295 --> 01:04:48.432
Me last word...

01:04:48.466 --> 01:04:50.368
is no.

01:04:51.469 --> 01:04:53.437
That's grand.
That's grand.

01:04:53.471 --> 01:04:55.473
Keep on sayin' that.
Keep on sayin' that.

01:04:55.506 --> 01:04:57.909
Keep on sayin' that.

01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:15.293
"The ruins of old Ireland,
how wondrously they stand

01:05:15.326 --> 01:05:16.895
"by the lakes and rushing rivers

01:05:16.928 --> 01:05:18.863
on the hilltops of our land."

01:05:18.897 --> 01:05:22.800
"Around these walls of battle--
the Viking and the Dane,

01:05:22.833 --> 01:05:25.503
the Norman and the Saxon
and the Cavaliers of Spain."

01:05:25.536 --> 01:05:30.508
Ah, it makes a man
feel like the lord
of the castle.

01:05:30.541 --> 01:05:33.811
I wonder now, is it
the Danes or the Vikings

01:05:33.844 --> 01:05:36.414
swarming up the valley
to storm the fort?

01:05:36.447 --> 01:05:37.748
The Danes.

01:05:37.781 --> 01:05:40.551
We'll both be put to the sword.

01:05:40.584 --> 01:05:42.386
But before we are,

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.556
you would crave the favor
of one last kiss.

01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:48.893
Mr. MacBride, I thought
you could do better than that.

01:05:48.927 --> 01:05:50.929
Maybe I could.

01:05:53.864 --> 01:05:54.864
(laughing)

01:06:25.163 --> 01:06:28.366
(gasps)
You don't care who
you walk out with,
do you?

01:06:28.399 --> 01:06:30.768
Get off this land,
or I'll report you
to his lordship.

01:06:30.801 --> 01:06:32.803
You do that.

01:06:32.836 --> 01:06:34.338
(laughs)

01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:41.545
Get out of the way.

01:06:41.579 --> 01:06:43.114
Look who's talking.

01:06:46.817 --> 01:06:49.487
If you lay a finger on him,
I'll never speak to you again!

01:07:18.616 --> 01:07:20.584
Katie...

01:07:20.618 --> 01:07:23.821
when I need your help
against the likes of that,
I'll ask for it.

01:07:23.854 --> 01:07:26.524
Pony Sugrue
would have killed you.

01:07:26.557 --> 01:07:27.591
Would you care?

01:07:27.625 --> 01:07:30.161
Not in the slightest.

01:07:30.194 --> 01:07:32.396
You have no interest
in me at all?

01:07:35.499 --> 01:07:37.401
You're certain sure?

01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:43.541
Kiss her. Kiss her.

01:07:43.574 --> 01:07:45.743
Go on, kiss her.

01:07:51.815 --> 01:07:52.815
Aah!

01:07:53.917 --> 01:07:56.887
And him a Dublin man!

01:08:00.591 --> 01:08:02.993
Look, look, look.

01:08:21.245 --> 01:08:23.214
Will you wish your wish now?

01:08:23.247 --> 01:08:25.549
I will indeed.
Good.

01:08:25.582 --> 01:08:28.519
(bell chiming)

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.890
The bell. Listen
to the music of it.

01:08:32.923 --> 01:08:35.158
Father Murphy gave it to me.

01:08:35.193 --> 01:08:36.894
But the wish, Darby.

01:08:36.926 --> 01:08:40.564
Ah, it would charm
the fishes from the deep

01:08:40.598 --> 01:08:42.832
and the little birds
down from the trees.

01:08:42.866 --> 01:08:44.868
You said you'd wish your wish.

01:08:44.902 --> 01:08:46.270
What? On Sunday,

01:08:46.304 --> 01:08:49.273
with my music floatin'
over the countryside

01:08:49.307 --> 01:08:53.176
and Father Murphy himself
pullin' the rope?

01:08:53.211 --> 01:08:55.578
Tomorrow is Monday.
Will you wish your wish then?

01:08:55.613 --> 01:08:58.916
I will. Hush now.

01:08:58.948 --> 01:09:00.951
Listen to my music.

01:09:11.929 --> 01:09:12.930
Whoa, there.

01:09:12.962 --> 01:09:14.232
Hello, Joe.

01:09:19.603 --> 01:09:21.572
Morning, Mrs. O'Toole.
There's the post.

01:09:21.604 --> 01:09:23.541
Did the tea come
down from Dublin?

01:09:23.573 --> 01:09:25.542
The pails, too.
Where's everybody going?

01:09:25.576 --> 01:09:27.778
To the pub.
Darby is making
his third wish.

01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:29.779
His third wish?

01:09:29.813 --> 01:09:31.582
The old fool.

01:09:31.615 --> 01:09:33.117
Old fool indeed.

01:09:33.151 --> 01:09:35.586
It's makin' too free
with them, Darby is.

01:09:35.618 --> 01:09:38.322
When you sup with the devil,
you need a long spoon.

01:09:38.356 --> 01:09:40.258
From America.
Nora Cassidy's son.

01:09:40.291 --> 01:09:42.225
Ah, there'll be money in that.

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:43.794
The pails, Mrs. O'Toole.

01:09:43.827 --> 01:09:45.263
Right you are, Pony.

01:09:45.296 --> 01:09:46.897
"Michael MacBride, Rathcullen."

01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:48.932
That's from
the Lord Fitzpatrick.

01:09:48.966 --> 01:09:51.335
I'd know his fist anywhere.

01:09:51.368 --> 01:09:54.838
Look at the elegant
swirls and all.

01:10:01.545 --> 01:10:04.848
So that's why his lordship
left him behind.

01:10:04.882 --> 01:10:07.818
And now 'tis "Michael" this
and "Michael" that.

01:10:07.851 --> 01:10:09.920
The Dublin jackeen.

01:10:09.953 --> 01:10:13.324
"And, Michael, go and open up
the manor house and get
Katie in to help."

01:10:13.357 --> 01:10:14.592
The dirty usurper!

01:10:14.625 --> 01:10:16.527
Poor old Darby.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:17.795
Poor Katie.

01:10:17.828 --> 01:10:19.297
I wonder, does she know?

01:10:20.964 --> 01:10:23.934
Maybe you should drop it by

01:10:23.967 --> 01:10:26.270
and leave her see it
for herself.

01:10:26.304 --> 01:10:30.274
Ohh. You think I should, now?

01:10:30.308 --> 01:10:33.311
No Christian bein'
would do any less.

01:10:34.845 --> 01:10:36.214
Then I will so.

01:10:38.316 --> 01:10:39.850
Look, Pony,

01:10:39.883 --> 01:10:42.320
his lordship wrote it
to young Michael MacBride,

01:10:42.353 --> 01:10:45.323
and nary a word to Darby,
now I ask you.

01:10:48.892 --> 01:10:50.894
Ha! And you said
you had an understanding

01:10:50.928 --> 01:10:53.197
with his lordship about me,

01:10:53.231 --> 01:10:55.799
and all this time,
MacBride has the job.

01:10:55.833 --> 01:10:58.236
He won't keep the job
if I have a son
who's man enough

01:10:58.269 --> 01:11:00.271
to run him out of town.

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:05.776
Well, Pony?

01:11:21.925 --> 01:11:23.861
What are you doing?

01:11:23.894 --> 01:11:26.864
I'm packing,
and if you don't know why,

01:11:26.897 --> 01:11:28.899
you can read the card.

01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:41.912
Why didn't you tell me?

01:11:41.945 --> 01:11:44.248
Your father made me promise
that I wouldn't.

01:11:44.282 --> 01:11:45.916
When are you throwin' us out?

01:11:45.949 --> 01:11:47.951
Oh, now, Katie.
When?

01:11:49.953 --> 01:11:52.423
Well, today was
supposed to have--
You give short notice.

01:11:52.456 --> 01:11:54.425
I don't want you
to leave at all.

01:11:54.458 --> 01:11:57.261
Why not? What does it
matter to you

01:11:57.295 --> 01:11:59.229
if you break an old man's heart?

01:11:59.263 --> 01:12:01.432
You're a strong young man.
You can find work anywhere.

01:12:01.465 --> 01:12:04.302
But, no, you must come here
and take me father's place.

01:12:04.335 --> 01:12:06.804
No wonder he's chasin'
the fairy gold,

01:12:06.837 --> 01:12:09.807
and him half
out of his mind,
tryin' to keep

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.376
some little bit
of self-respect
in the town.

01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:15.313
Here, you can clean
the manor house yourself.

01:12:15.346 --> 01:12:18.248
It'll be all we can do
to move our belongin's

01:12:18.282 --> 01:12:20.384
out of your house this night.

01:12:20.418 --> 01:12:23.887
Now, you listen to me.
I don't want your
father's job at all,

01:12:23.921 --> 01:12:25.956
not unless I can have
the both of you
along with it.

01:12:25.989 --> 01:12:28.392
I want you to stay here
and be my wife.

01:12:28.426 --> 01:12:31.261
I love you, Katie,
and I think that
you love me.

01:12:31.295 --> 01:12:34.131
I? Love you?

01:12:45.309 --> 01:12:46.910
Everybody ready?

01:12:46.944 --> 01:12:48.245
Yes, we're all ready, Darby.

01:12:48.278 --> 01:12:50.247
Run and get
a turf creel,
a big one.

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.483
What for?
For to hold the gold.

01:12:52.516 --> 01:12:55.252
I'll not wish
for the gold.
Why not?

01:12:55.285 --> 01:12:58.356
Nine times out of ten,
it leads to unhappiness.

01:12:58.389 --> 01:13:00.257
Wish for happiness, then.

01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:03.961
Human beings need bitter
with the sweet.

01:13:03.994 --> 01:13:08.932
When I was a young lad,
knee high with a sod of turf,

01:13:08.966 --> 01:13:12.302
me grandfather Podge--
God be good to him--

01:13:12.336 --> 01:13:16.206
he told me there was
only one man in the town

01:13:16.239 --> 01:13:19.176
who was happy altogether--

01:13:19.209 --> 01:13:20.878
the village idiot.

01:13:20.911 --> 01:13:23.481
(laughter)
(King Brian) Ha!

01:13:23.514 --> 01:13:26.183
Were you addressing me,
Your Majesty?

01:13:26.216 --> 01:13:28.285
What's all
the speechmaking about?

01:13:28.318 --> 01:13:30.888
Are you standin'
for Parliament or what?

01:13:30.921 --> 01:13:33.524
Will I get you a drink, sir?
You could make a wish.

01:13:33.557 --> 01:13:35.158
Get on with it.
I'll do that.

01:13:35.192 --> 01:13:37.361
You know what
I'd wish for, Darby?

01:13:37.395 --> 01:13:39.963
I'd wish for a grand,
big house on top of a hill,

01:13:39.997 --> 01:13:41.899
as big as the castle at Cong.

01:13:41.932 --> 01:13:44.535
How would you look after it?
I'd have the servants, too.

01:13:44.568 --> 01:13:46.404
You didn't wish
for the servants,

01:13:46.437 --> 01:13:48.406
for the money to run the house.

01:13:48.439 --> 01:13:50.974
There you'd be
with a big house
in your hands,

01:13:51.008 --> 01:13:52.510
as big as a church,

01:13:52.543 --> 01:13:55.379
and you the poorest
church mouse in it.

01:13:55.413 --> 01:13:56.580
Did you hear that?

01:13:56.614 --> 01:14:00.384
Oh, he's got a head
on his shoulders
like Aristotle.

01:14:00.418 --> 01:14:02.553
Father!
Think of the best...

01:14:02.586 --> 01:14:05.923
then ask yourself,
"What else might I lose
if I had it?"

01:14:05.956 --> 01:14:08.426
Father, you've got to come
and catch the horse.
Not now, Katie.

01:14:08.459 --> 01:14:10.528
His lordship is comin'.
We've got to move today!

01:14:10.561 --> 01:14:13.897
Move out of the way, Katie.
I'm makin' me third wish.

01:14:13.931 --> 01:14:14.932
Not here, Father!

01:14:16.934 --> 01:14:18.135
Wait, Your Highness!

01:14:20.404 --> 01:14:22.272
Wait, Your Highness.
Wait!

01:14:22.305 --> 01:14:24.374
(mocking)
Wait, Your Highness.
Wait!

01:14:24.408 --> 01:14:26.444
(man) Catch him, Darby!
Catch the coinin!

01:14:26.477 --> 01:14:29.346
(all shouting)

01:14:29.379 --> 01:14:30.781
Darby, catch the coinin!

01:14:30.814 --> 01:14:33.050
Make him give you
the crocks of gold!

01:14:40.791 --> 01:14:42.960
Get out of my way.
Leave that horse alone.

01:14:42.993 --> 01:14:46.196
Do you think I'd stay under
your roof another night?
I'll go to the inn.

01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:48.398
You can go to blazes.
I'm movin' to the
McCarthy house.

01:14:48.432 --> 01:14:51.535
With night coming down on
that mountainside, you could
get yourself killed.

01:14:51.569 --> 01:14:54.337
Now, give me that halter.
I'll get the horse.

01:15:48.225 --> 01:15:50.260
Ah, well, you look grand.

01:15:50.293 --> 01:15:53.163
Now, don't move a finger
until his lordship comes.

01:15:59.469 --> 01:16:01.038
Katie!

01:16:04.307 --> 01:16:05.408
Katie!

01:16:22.225 --> 01:16:23.326
Katie!

01:16:29.499 --> 01:16:30.768
Katie!

01:16:33.537 --> 01:16:35.172
Katie!

01:16:37.608 --> 01:16:39.209
Katie!

01:16:48.586 --> 01:16:50.353
(sniffs)

01:16:51.555 --> 01:16:53.757
Is it drunk you are?

01:17:03.433 --> 01:17:05.402
Who did it, lad?

01:17:05.435 --> 01:17:07.571
I don't know, but I can guess.

01:17:07.605 --> 01:17:08.572
Where's Katie?

01:17:08.606 --> 01:17:10.841
She's gone after the horse.

01:17:10.874 --> 01:17:13.376
Did you let her go alone
in the dark of the night?

01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:16.513
She was in a tearin' rage
at me, and sure it was
your fault

01:17:16.546 --> 01:17:18.782
for not telling her the truth
in the first place.

01:17:18.816 --> 01:17:20.818
God forgive me.
She'll be chasin' a puca.

01:17:23.621 --> 01:17:26.223
Oh, for goodness sakes.

01:17:27.791 --> 01:17:30.160
(female voice wailing)

01:17:31.829 --> 01:17:33.764
The bean sí! (banshee)

01:17:33.797 --> 01:17:35.265
Maybe it's just the wind.

01:17:35.298 --> 01:17:37.768
It's the wail of the bean sí,

01:17:37.801 --> 01:17:41.772
the same as I heard the night
that Katie's mother was taken.

01:17:41.805 --> 01:17:44.241
She'll be destroyed entirely!

01:17:47.577 --> 01:17:51.114
(thunder rumbling)

01:18:00.457 --> 01:18:02.292
Katie!

01:18:05.829 --> 01:18:07.430
Katie!

01:18:16.506 --> 01:18:17.507
Katie!

01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:18.575
(echo) Katie!

01:18:18.608 --> 01:18:20.510
Katie!

01:18:20.543 --> 01:18:22.345
(echo) Katie!

01:18:23.613 --> 01:18:25.115
Katie!

01:18:28.518 --> 01:18:29.787
Katie!

01:18:33.523 --> 01:18:35.158
Katie.

01:18:36.559 --> 01:18:37.961
Katie!

01:18:57.347 --> 01:18:59.549
Katie!

01:18:59.582 --> 01:19:01.318
Katie!

01:19:16.834 --> 01:19:18.368
The bean sí!

01:19:20.871 --> 01:19:22.773
(wailing)

01:19:30.547 --> 01:19:32.282
Keep away! Keep away!

01:19:39.589 --> 01:19:41.424
Keep away from her!

01:19:41.458 --> 01:19:43.226
Keep off!

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:45.863
(wailing loudly)

01:19:48.899 --> 01:19:51.434
Keep off, now!
Keep off, now!

01:20:01.611 --> 01:20:03.881
Oh, me poor darlin'.

01:20:03.914 --> 01:20:06.784
Your daddy didn't mean
to do you any harm.

01:20:06.817 --> 01:20:08.786
Speak to me.
Speak to me.

01:20:08.819 --> 01:20:09.853
Darby.

01:20:09.887 --> 01:20:12.422
What have I done to you?

01:20:12.455 --> 01:20:14.491
We'd better get her home.

01:21:19.957 --> 01:21:23.026
(banshee wailing)

01:22:26.924 --> 01:22:31.361
Brian! King Brian!

01:22:31.394 --> 01:22:34.864
King Brian!
King Brian!

01:22:34.898 --> 01:22:37.100
What is it, man?

01:22:37.134 --> 01:22:38.768
Your Highness!

01:22:38.801 --> 01:22:40.403
What is it?

01:22:40.437 --> 01:22:42.906
It's the cóiste-bodhar,
the Death Coach.

01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:44.441
Send it away!

01:22:48.878 --> 01:22:51.915
It's comin' for Katie.
Send it away.

01:22:51.949 --> 01:22:54.451
But it's not within
my powers, man.

01:22:54.484 --> 01:22:57.120
Once it sets out,
it can never return empty.

01:22:57.154 --> 01:23:00.423
Then give me me third wish
and let it take me instead.

01:23:00.457 --> 01:23:02.892
You don't know
what you're askin' for.

01:23:02.926 --> 01:23:04.761
You promised!
Don't break your word.

01:23:04.794 --> 01:23:07.564
Darby O'Gill,
never in me born days...

01:23:07.597 --> 01:23:09.532
Give me me third wish.

01:23:09.566 --> 01:23:12.802
More's the pity.

01:23:12.835 --> 01:23:14.804
Granted.

01:23:49.272 --> 01:23:50.873
Darby O'Gill.

01:23:57.847 --> 01:23:59.116
Get in.

01:25:00.610 --> 01:25:02.912
(King Brian) Darby.

01:25:02.945 --> 01:25:05.582
Darby.

01:25:05.615 --> 01:25:08.551
I was on me way back home,
and I says to meself,

01:25:08.585 --> 01:25:12.155
"Brian," says I,
"'tis at his side
you should be."

01:25:12.189 --> 01:25:14.857
Well, then, the truth of it is,

01:25:14.891 --> 01:25:16.893
I'm real glad to see you.

01:25:16.926 --> 01:25:20.497
Ah, Darby, me boy,

01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:22.865
we've had great sport together.

01:25:22.899 --> 01:25:24.267
Aye, we did.

01:25:24.301 --> 01:25:27.937
You've been a grand adversary.

01:25:27.970 --> 01:25:31.574
'Tis sorry I am
to see you come to this.

01:25:31.608 --> 01:25:34.277
I can endure anything
if Katie was all right.

01:25:34.311 --> 01:25:36.779
Ah, you needn't fret
about Katie.

01:25:36.813 --> 01:25:39.249
Her fever broke the minute
you set foot in this coach.

01:25:44.821 --> 01:25:47.157
I'll be forever grateful to you.

01:25:51.828 --> 01:25:54.764
In the years to come,

01:25:54.797 --> 01:25:58.568
maybe you'd keep an eye
on Katie and Michael.

01:25:58.601 --> 01:26:00.270
I'll do that.

01:26:03.173 --> 01:26:05.242
'Tis a pity you won't be there

01:26:05.275 --> 01:26:07.244
to see them married.

01:26:07.277 --> 01:26:11.214
Ah, it's better
for the old to die
than the young.

01:26:11.248 --> 01:26:13.816
In the end, we all have to go.

01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:16.119
That you do.

01:26:21.258 --> 01:26:24.161
I wish I could go with you
all the way.

01:26:25.995 --> 01:26:27.930
I wish you could, too.

01:26:27.964 --> 01:26:31.834
(laughing)

01:26:31.868 --> 01:26:35.905
And you a knowledgeable man!

01:26:35.938 --> 01:26:39.842
Darby, you've wished
your fourth wish.

01:26:39.876 --> 01:26:43.346
Goodbye, Darby, me friend.

01:26:45.882 --> 01:26:49.952
(King Brian laughs)

01:26:58.895 --> 01:27:00.797
It's a miracle.

01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:04.033
She's fine and sonsy,
like a baby woken
from sleep.

01:27:13.243 --> 01:27:15.545
Michael, what a temper I have.

01:27:15.578 --> 01:27:17.847
Well...

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.249
I like a lively girl.

01:27:23.353 --> 01:27:26.223
I suppose I'm the only man
alive today

01:27:26.256 --> 01:27:28.391
to have rode
in the cóiste-bodhar

01:27:28.425 --> 01:27:30.893
and come back to tell it.

01:27:30.927 --> 01:27:32.362
Cóiste-bodhar.

01:27:32.395 --> 01:27:34.397
'Twas his lordship's
carriage you saw.

01:27:34.431 --> 01:27:38.901
His coachman told me
they found you rootin'
in the mud of the road,

01:27:38.935 --> 01:27:41.838
so far gone in grief
you were out of your mind
entirely.

01:27:41.871 --> 01:27:44.307
(laughs)

01:27:44.341 --> 01:27:46.876
Pony, I heard you were goin'
to live in Cahersiveen.

01:27:46.909 --> 01:27:48.911
I am.

01:27:48.945 --> 01:27:50.889
Then why don't you
be on your way
and leave us alone?

01:27:50.913 --> 01:27:52.415
Don't worry. I will.

01:27:52.449 --> 01:27:54.984
I've heard
enough silly blather
about little people

01:27:55.017 --> 01:27:56.886
to last me a lifetime.

01:27:56.919 --> 01:27:58.888
What kind of man are you at all

01:27:58.921 --> 01:28:00.890
that doesn't believe
in the little people?

01:28:00.923 --> 01:28:02.892
Maybe you'd like to find out.

01:28:02.925 --> 01:28:04.394
Indeed I would.

01:28:04.427 --> 01:28:06.829
You know, somebody beat me
over the head that night,

01:28:06.863 --> 01:28:08.898
and I thought
it was the little people,

01:28:08.931 --> 01:28:10.867
but when I spoke
to King Brian about it,

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:13.336
he said that you
should take the consequences.

01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:15.905
What consequences?

01:28:15.938 --> 01:28:17.907
Indeed, that's what
I asked his majesty,

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.442
and you know what he said?

01:28:19.476 --> 01:28:21.444
He said, "If I were you,

01:28:21.478 --> 01:28:23.880
I'd clout the blackguard
in the face."

01:28:38.828 --> 01:28:40.397
Ooh.
(glass breaks)

01:28:41.464 --> 01:28:43.099
Ohh.

01:28:45.502 --> 01:28:47.904
(glass breaks)
Ohh!

01:28:47.937 --> 01:28:48.971
Oh, gosh.

01:28:51.308 --> 01:28:53.175
Ooh!

01:29:01.951 --> 01:29:03.119
(whispers) Come on.

01:29:29.946 --> 01:29:31.448
(whimpers)

01:29:32.549 --> 01:29:35.251
Pony, me darlin'.

01:29:35.284 --> 01:29:36.953
Oh, you poor thing.

01:29:36.986 --> 01:29:39.922
Hold your whisht.
I'll have no more
from you.

01:29:39.956 --> 01:29:42.925
That didn't take long.
Now I can get back
to work.

01:29:42.959 --> 01:29:44.994
I even feel like workin' meself.

01:29:45.027 --> 01:29:47.263
I do indeed. Aye.

01:29:47.296 --> 01:29:49.308
How do you feel
about bringin' in
the rest of the turf?

01:29:49.332 --> 01:29:51.934
Well, lad, you took the words
right out of me mouth.

01:29:51.968 --> 01:29:53.936
Come around, Cleopatra.
Come on, now.

01:29:53.970 --> 01:29:56.439
* Oh, she is my dear,
my darlin' one

01:29:56.473 --> 01:29:58.975
* Her eyes so sparklin'
full of fun

01:29:59.008 --> 01:30:03.513
* No other, no other
can match the likes of her

01:30:03.546 --> 01:30:05.348
* Oh, he is my dear,
my darling one

01:30:05.382 --> 01:30:07.384
* His eyes so sparkling
full of fun

01:30:07.417 --> 01:30:09.886
* No other, no other

01:30:09.919 --> 01:30:12.389
* Can match the likes of him

01:30:12.422 --> 01:30:14.199
* She is my dear, my
darlin' one
* He is my dear,
my darlin' one

01:30:14.223 --> 01:30:15.458
* My smilin' and beguilin' one

01:30:15.492 --> 01:30:17.226
* I love the ground...

01:30:17.259 --> 01:30:18.895
* She walks upon * He walks upon

01:30:18.928 --> 01:30:21.531
* My darlin' Irish...

01:30:21.564 --> 01:30:24.166
* Girl * Boy
