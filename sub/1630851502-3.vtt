- Oh, my gosh, now that is--

19:11.541 --> 19:13.587
- Look at the fishing lure.
- Oh, my.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.546
Who is that dude right there?
Was that the chef?

19:16.590 --> 19:18.461
- We were on the plane,

19:18.505 --> 19:20.681
and there was a handsome
gentleman sitting behind us.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.900
So the lady sitting next to him
was asking him, like,

19:22.944 --> 19:24.772
500 questions,
which was great for us.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.731
- We knew everything about him
before he even knew our names.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.429
- Then we heard him talk
about "Family Feud,"

19:29.472 --> 19:30.908
and we were like,
"That's weird."

19:30.952 --> 19:32.562
- And I on purposely
threw my earphone back

19:32.606 --> 19:33.868
so he could get it.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.435
- And I was like,
"I'm so sorry.

19:35.478 --> 19:36.610
She just--it was a mistake."

19:36.653 --> 19:38.002
- So you're on "Family Feud"?

19:38.046 --> 19:39.526
- Yeah, and I was like,

19:39.569 --> 19:41.136
"But did you say something
about 'family Feud'?"

19:41.180 --> 19:42.659
And he's like,
"Yeah, that's why I'm here."

19:42.703 --> 19:44.226
And I was like, "What?"
And I was like,

19:44.270 --> 19:46.402
"Well, we're here all weekend.
You should text Rachel."

19:46.446 --> 19:47.621
And he did.

19:47.664 --> 19:49.492
- Are you on the prowl again?

19:49.536 --> 19:51.625
- They're on the prowl for me.

19:51.668 --> 19:54.541
He came to dinner with us.

19:54.584 --> 19:56.325
He was hysterical.
- He was funny.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.240
He fits in well
with this group.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.415
- Really nice guy.
- Yeah.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.287
- Where's he staying?

20:01.330 --> 20:03.593
- Here.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.943
- Dad, you told me specifically

20:05.987 --> 20:08.946
when you stop looking,
then you'll meet a guy.

20:08.990 --> 20:12.036
- I didn't think it'd be
in the same hotel.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.691
Am I gonna meet him today?

20:14.735 --> 20:16.215
- He already called me
this morning.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.781
- He already called you?
Here.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.348
Call him back.
Give me the phone.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.394
- Oh, my God.
- Shh, shh, Matt.

20:21.437 --> 20:22.569
- Play cool.
Play cool.

20:22.612 --> 20:24.440
- He's gonna think
I'm a stalker.

20:27.487 --> 20:30.446
- This is Terry Bradshaw.
Is this punk Matt?

20:30.490 --> 20:32.709
- You said you were
gonna be nice.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.755
<i>- Next time
on the "Bradshaw Bunch"...</i>

20:34.798 --> 20:36.278
- Welcome to Hollywood.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.845
- Yeah!

20:37.888 --> 20:40.369
- We are going to my star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.284
- Oh, my God.
- Come here.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.068
- No one's gonna believe this.

20:44.112 --> 20:47.289
- I cannot believe my dad
invited you to dinner.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.595
I don't know this guy.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.205
- We're an easy-going bunch
of folks.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.380
- No, we're not.

20:51.424 --> 20:53.295
- Time to play the feud.
One, two, three.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.514
Win!

20:54.557 --> 20:55.993
- Let's be sharp.
Let's be witty.

20:56.037 --> 20:58.344
Let's not panic.
It's gonna be a great day.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.693
Trust yourself, okay?

20:59.736 --> 21:01.042
- Well, let's just get it on.

21:01.085 --> 21:02.913
- Let's play the game.
- Let's have a good time.
