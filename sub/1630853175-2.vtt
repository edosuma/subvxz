- Dennis, he was in the trunk.
- Mm-hmm.

42:42.646 --> 42:45.315
- Right, but the trunk wasn't
a trunk. It was a trunk.

42:45.315 --> 42:47.276
- Did you inhale too much smoke?

42:47.276 --> 42:49.528
- The Eye doesn't give knowledge.

42:50.654 --> 42:53.615
It gives data. It's up to you
to decipher what it means.

43:07.421 --> 43:08.672
- No.

43:08.672 --> 43:10.674
It stays between you and me.

If we learned anything last year,
it's that we can't trust anyone.
