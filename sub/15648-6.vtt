Rocko!

14:07.513 --> 14:08.889
(<i> groaning</i> )

14:08.973 --> 14:09.932
What in the...?

14:10.015 --> 14:11.600
Hef, what now?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.269
Your couch ran away.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.770
Can I sleep with you?

14:14.853 --> 14:16.146
Mmm.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.440
Okay, but just for tonight.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.067

(<i> snoring</i> )

14:41.130 --> 14:44.383
{\an1}Oh, well, I guess
this'll have to do.

{\an3}(<i> snoring</i> )

14:47.970 --> 14:48.971

Man, alive, somebody's dying!

14:54.518 --> 14:57.229
What the heck is that noise?!

(<i> crash</i> )

15:06.238 --> 15:07.573
(<i> snoring resumes</i> )

15:11.452 --> 15:13.662
I knew this would come in handy.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.623
(<i> electricity crackling</i> )

15:15.706 --> 15:16.165
Blazes!

15:16.248 --> 15:18.417
Mmm.

15:28.969 --> 15:29.803
{\an3}(<i> yawning</i> )

15:29.887 --> 15:31.680
Nothing like
a good night's sleep.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.016
I had this wild dream.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.019
Electric eels were
biting my butt.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.854
{\an3}(<i> humming</i> )

15:38.937 --> 15:40.189
Time for my beauty bath.

(<i> Heffer imitating</i>

15:54.036 --> 15:54.912
Ah!

15:54.995 --> 15:57.623
{\an1}Nothing like a hot shower
to start the day.

15:57.706 --> 15:58.415
Bathroom's all yours.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.210
(<i> coughing</i> )

16:08.634 --> 16:12.262
(<i> screaming</i> )

16:16.517 --> 16:18.560
T-t-t-towel.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.230
{\an3}Ugh!

16:21.313 --> 16:23.816
I-It's a night... nightmare.

(<i> rock music blaring</i> )

16:56.890 --> 16:57.599
Oh. Hey, Rocko.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.978
What... what have you done?

17:01.061 --> 17:02.020
Pretty cool, huh?

17:02.104 --> 17:03.439
{\an1}Gave all your dull
old stuff to charity.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.607
You...!

17:05.691 --> 17:06.942
Thank me over dinner.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.484
I made us my specialty.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.446
Wah!

17:11.530 --> 17:12.656
The Heffer deluxe.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.786
Hef, this is bonza.

17:17.869 --> 17:18.829
What's in it?

17:18.912 --> 17:19.997
Well, let's see...

17:20.079 --> 17:23.916
{\an1}there's pickled banana shavings,
gym socks,

17:24.001 --> 17:24.835
{\an1}canned haggis,
beetle bladders,

17:24.917 --> 17:27.963
{\an1}real processed head cheese,
saltpeter,

17:28.047 --> 17:29.506
reconstituted corn sweat,

17:29.590 --> 17:31.175
the finest barley
and hops...

17:32.551 --> 17:33.302
Now where was I?

17:33.385 --> 17:34.970
Potash, sulfur,
monosodium glutamate

17:35.053 --> 17:37.973
{\an1}and vegetable cartilage
as a binding agent.

17:39.057 --> 17:42.436
{\an1}Eh, eh, no dessert
until you finish your meal.

17:47.274 --> 17:47.775
{\an1}<i>Voila!</i>

17:47.858 --> 17:50.068
Now, time for dessert.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.028
(<i> sniffing</i> )

17:51.111 --> 17:52.529
Hey, this smells delicious.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.697
What is it?

17:53.781 --> 17:54.615
Heffer soufflé...

17:54.698 --> 17:56.909

(<i> explosion</i> )

17:58.535 --> 17:58.869
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

17:58.952 --> 18:00.496
Don't get up.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.538
It's probably for me.

18:01.622 --> 18:05.000
Hey, I did dinner,
so you do the dishes.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.794
{\an1}Mom?

18:06.877 --> 18:07.961
Yes, it's me.

18:08.045 --> 18:08.629
You want me home?

18:08.712 --> 18:11.215
Extra meals?!

18:11.298 --> 18:12.299
{\an1}Wow!

18:12.382 --> 18:15.803
{\an1}The fact is, Mom,
my new home is here with Rocko.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.305
{\an1}I'm going
to stay forever...

18:18.388 --> 18:20.891
{\an1}(<i> echoing</i> ):
and ever and ever...

(<i> brakes squeal</i> )

18:39.368 --> 18:40.494
Hef?

18:40.577 --> 18:41.370
Hef?

18:41.453 --> 18:43.288
Hef.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.748
There you are.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.375
Hey, Rocko.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.043
Boy, Hef...

18:48.126 --> 18:50.587
you're... you're...

18:50.671 --> 18:52.798
Naked!

18:52.881 --> 18:54.132
Hef, wait!

18:54.216 --> 18:55.551
Where do you think
you're going, bub?

18:55.634 --> 18:58.220
Out into my backyard.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.347
Not like that,
you're not.

19:00.430 --> 19:01.390
Oh, yeah?

19:01.473 --> 19:02.766
Out of my way!

19:05.144 --> 19:06.436
Oh, cobblers!

19:06.520 --> 19:07.729
Crikey!

19:07.813 --> 19:09.189
What's going on?!

19:19.616 --> 19:20.284
{\an1}VOICE:
Nice Buick.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.414
{\an1}ROCKO:
Hef.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.707
What's going on?

19:26.790 --> 19:28.166
Rocko, living here
has allowed me

19:28.250 --> 19:31.795
to explore new facets
of my personality.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.922
I am a nudist.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.216
Bev, I can't believe it!

19:36.300 --> 19:39.469
Do you know what that weirdo
next door is up to?

19:39.553 --> 19:42.556
Oh, shut up
and mind your own business, Ed.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.601
Bev, they're, well...

19:45.684 --> 19:46.768
{\an3}nude!

19:46.852 --> 19:50.272
Oh, Ed, you're right.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.984
Oh, yes! This is disgusting!

19:54.067 --> 19:56.778
{\an1}Quick, Ed, get the telescope
out of the hall closet.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.907
I want all you nudists
out of here this instant!

20:02.367 --> 20:03.201
And stay out.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.121
At least I have my dignity.

20:06.204 --> 20:07.623
{\an1}Heffer, you listen
and you listen good.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.917
This is my house

20:10.000 --> 20:12.502
{\an1}and you've taken advantage
of my hospitality

20:12.586 --> 20:13.879
for the last time...

20:13.962 --> 20:16.590
HEFFER (<i> thinking</i> ):
<i>Oh, boy, am I hungry.</i>

20:16.673 --> 20:18.383
<i>Gee, he sounds a little angry.</i>

20:18.467 --> 20:20.469
<i>Maybe I should tell him now.</i>

20:20.552 --> 20:23.263
Hef! Hef, are you
listening to me?

20:23.347 --> 20:25.307
Uh... no.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.643
Sorry, Rock, but there's
something I need to tell you.

20:27.726 --> 20:31.188
Now don't take this personally,
but I've come to the conclusion

20:31.271 --> 20:34.816
that you're just too difficult
to live with.

20:34.900 --> 20:35.943
What?!

20:36.026 --> 20:37.945
Rocko, I hope you're
not disappointed.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.821
We're still friends,
aren't we?

20:39.905 --> 20:42.032
We'll always be friends.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.284
A-ha!

20:44.368 --> 20:46.286
{\an1}(<i> gasps</i> ):
Dad?

20:46.370 --> 20:47.496
{\an1}I knew it!

20:47.579 --> 20:48.372
This place is a pigsty.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.249
Your dear mother
insisted I come here

20:50.332 --> 20:54.336
{\an1}and bring your big,
beefy, bovine buns back home.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.838
Okay-- be right
with you, Pop.

20:56.922 --> 21:00.008
{\an1}Well, old pal,
till our paths cross again.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.844
See you tomorrow, Rock.

21:02.928 --> 21:07.975
{\an4}(<i> chuckling</i> ):
Hey, put some trousers on,
you crazy kid, you.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.436
(<i> whimpering</i> )

21:13.772 --> 21:16.149
{\an1}Ah, Spunky,
I'm glad that's over.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.819
{\an1}Now for a peaceful
night's sleep.

21:20.237 --> 21:23.031
{\an5}BEV:
All right, time to party,
you animals!

21:23.115 --> 21:24.866
(<i> partygoers talking</i> )

21:24.950 --> 21:28.495
Spunky, it's Mrs. Bighead...

21:28.578 --> 21:31.039
and... and the nudists!

21:31.123 --> 21:33.583
{\an5}ED:
Bev, what are all these freaks
doing here?!

21:33.667 --> 21:36.294
{\an5}BEV:
Oh, shut up, Ed,
and get your trousers off

21:36.378 --> 21:37.504
and join the party,

21:37.587 --> 21:40.424
because we are going to boogie
till the sun comes up!
