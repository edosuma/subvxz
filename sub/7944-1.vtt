01:41.634 --> 01:45.837
It started a half hour ago.
She ran in screaming, going nuts.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.673
- Ma'am, open this door!
- She woke the whole damned place up.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.609
- Man: <i>Shut the fuck up, bitch!
- Get back! Get those people back-- now!</i>

01:51.611 --> 01:56.481
- <i>( police radio chatter )</i>
<i>- Ma'am, open this door now!</i>

01:56.483 --> 01:58.316
Woman: <i>He's trying to kill me!</i>

01:58.318 --> 01:59.684
Man: <i>Bitch!</i>

02:00.719 --> 02:03.554
<i>He's gonna kill me!</i>
<i>( sobbing )</i>

02:03.556 --> 02:05.389
Ma'am, are you alone in this room?

02:05.391 --> 02:07.658
I didn't do nothin'!
I didn't-- I didn't!

02:07.660 --> 02:09.794
( sobbing ) please don't hurt me!

02:09.795 --> 02:12.230
I can't get these off.

02:12.232 --> 02:14.532
Get these fucking things off my hands!

02:14.534 --> 02:17.368
Please, get them--
get them off of me!

02:17.370 --> 02:19.737
Get-- get them off.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.739
- Calm down, hold on.
- Get them off!

02:21.741 --> 02:25.877
Please get them off!
( sobs )

02:25.879 --> 02:28.679
It's okay. It's okay.

02:28.681 --> 02:31.649
It's okay.
Shhh.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.418
It's all right.
He's not coming.

02:46.632 --> 02:49.667
Woman: She's had intercourse.
Some older bumps and bruises.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.936
The only fresh markings are from the cuffs.

02:53.438 --> 02:55.273
Ma'am, please stay in there.

02:58.377 --> 03:00.178
- Can't I just go?
- We're gonna need you

03:00.180 --> 03:02.246
To come down to the station and go over a few things.

03:04.183 --> 03:06.317
- I don't know what else I can tell you.
- I know.

03:06.319 --> 03:09.287
- I told you everything.
- Miss, we're gonna need to keep your items.

03:09.289 --> 03:12.523
Sign this.
You can put these on.

03:24.336 --> 03:26.637
Man: Her details check out. Address, car rego--

03:26.639 --> 03:28.873
All match the suspect.
Now she said she got away

03:28.875 --> 03:31.542
- When he was putting her in his plane.
- Yeah well, he denies it.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.245
Says his family is out of town and
he was at two friends' all night.

03:34.247 --> 03:37.515
Both confirm it. Even some pizza
guy says he saw him there.

03:37.517 --> 03:39.650
Man ♪2: <i>...And then he chained you to a post</i>

03:39.652 --> 03:41.852
<i>And then he raped you?</i>

03:41.854 --> 03:43.988
I told you already, that was before.

03:43.990 --> 03:46.958
- On a bearskin.
- You told the other officer it was a bed.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.393
No, it was a bearskin on the floor.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.395
What the fuck is he trying to do?

03:51.397 --> 03:53.931
How many times did you say he had intercourse with you?

03:53.933 --> 03:56.000
Once. He...

03:57.803 --> 03:58.903
Just once.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.239
Was it vaginally or--
or anally?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.840
I mean, before you said it was both.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.942
Look, he did it normal--
on top.

04:04.944 --> 04:07.678
And then he--

04:07.680 --> 04:10.648
He wrapped the chain around my neck.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.917
He was gonna kill me.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.953
- Yeah, but what about the bed?
- There was no bed!

04:15.955 --> 04:18.656
When he chained me he put a blanket down on the ground.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.791
You're a prostitute, aren't you?

04:20.793 --> 04:23.761
- Is 23 your real age?
- ( Scoffs ) yes.

04:24.830 --> 04:26.864
Why would he want to put you on a plane?

04:28.333 --> 04:30.268
He said he wanted to take me to his cabin.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.636
<i>Hmmm.</i>

04:31.638 --> 04:33.804
Am I being booked?

04:35.774 --> 04:38.476
Listen, I've spoken to this Bob Hansen.

04:38.478 --> 04:41.279
<i>He has two friends that say he was with</i> them <i>all night,</i>

04:41.281 --> 04:44.682
And now I'm trying to work out if you
were even with this guy last night.

04:53.292 --> 04:55.426
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

04:58.764 --> 05:00.998
Yeah?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.634
- Wait, what just happened?
- <i>( Baby fussing )</i>

05:03.636 --> 05:06.637
- Oh shhh.
- Okay.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.339
<i>I...</i>

05:14.980 --> 05:16.447
( sighs )

05:17.382 --> 05:18.883
Did you already pack the cereal?

05:18.885 --> 05:21.018
Yeah, the kitchen's mostly packed.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.354
- Hey, dad!
- Oh, you gonna catch some grizzly bears today?

05:23.356 --> 05:24.855
Where you goin'?

05:24.857 --> 05:27.958
- Only two more weeks.
- Why don't you come on back to bed?

05:29.628 --> 05:31.362
I get the next decade, okay?

05:33.832 --> 05:36.467
- Did you sign that check?
- <i>I'm late as it is.</i>

05:36.469 --> 05:38.869
Hon, they're not gonna come and move all this stuff

05:38.871 --> 05:41.038
- If you don't pay them.
- <i>( Door closes )</i>

05:51.583 --> 05:53.984
Found her last night way up the knik.

05:53.986 --> 05:57.355
Sergeant hawks is taking the
boat downriver from the bridge.

05:58.423 --> 06:00.524
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

06:14.072 --> 06:15.473
Thanks. Sarge, she's right over here.

06:18.944 --> 06:21.912
I don't know.
Take a look at this.

06:21.914 --> 06:23.948
Man:
<i>Hey, Jack.</i>

06:23.950 --> 06:27.051
- This one of your missing persons?
- Eh, it could be.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.387
She's female.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.422
Late teens, maybe early 20s.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.891
My girl has a jacket just like that.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.660
<i>Bear dug her up. Been in here-- I don't know--</i>

06:36.662 --> 06:38.396
<i>Six months, maybe a year.</i>

06:38.398 --> 06:40.464
Doesn't look like she was hiking.

06:40.466 --> 06:42.833
- A purse?
- They're still searching.

06:42.835 --> 06:45.503
It's gonna be a hard one. One
of the boys found this though,

06:45.505 --> 06:48.072
In the grave.
Execution style.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.408
You ever wish you'd stayed in white collar, Lyle?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.410
( chuckles )

06:52.412 --> 06:54.512
You sound just like my wife.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.680
- You gonna take over?
- Jack: Yeah.

06:57.883 --> 06:59.917
She's not missing anymore.

07:01.486 --> 07:04.422
...So I asked him straight.
I said "did you do this?"

07:04.424 --> 07:07.992
He said "you can't rape a prostitute,
can you?" how the fuck's that?

07:07.994 --> 07:10.060
( laughs ) hey, you can let her go.

07:10.062 --> 07:13.964
- She's telling the truth.
- She's a prostitute that refused a polygraph.

07:13.966 --> 07:16.066
- It's a dead end.
- What do you expect her to do?

07:16.068 --> 07:18.836
- We should be going back there and getting a warrant!
- Hey, listen,

07:18.838 --> 07:22.039
Who knows what the fuck went on.
Hansen's an upstanding citizen.

07:22.041 --> 07:25.142
The man has a wife, children and
no record on the computers.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.111
The lieutenant and I
spoke with the D.A.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.847
and there's not enough to say she
was even in the guy's place,

07:29.849 --> 07:33.150
So there won't be a warrant.
I'm taking it from here.

07:37.155 --> 07:39.590
<i>( siren blares )</i>

07:42.527 --> 07:43.861
( honks )

08:05.884 --> 08:08.118
The victim was Sherry morrow, 23,

08:08.120 --> 08:10.921
A.K.A. Sherry graves
or Sherry Georgia.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.823
She was reported missing last November

08:12.825 --> 08:14.658
After saying she was going to meet a man

08:14.660 --> 08:16.594
- For a $300 photo session.
- <i>( Murmuring )</i>

08:16.596 --> 08:19.063
Any connection to the Jane Doe found last year

08:19.065 --> 08:21.031
- Called Eklutna Annie?
- No, Sheila.

08:21.033 --> 08:26.036
Another officer described Sherry
and sue luna as carbon copies?

08:26.038 --> 08:28.072
They were both dancers at the wild cherry

08:28.074 --> 08:30.207
And good times clubs and both said they

08:30.209 --> 08:31.809
<i>Were leaving to meet a photographer.</i>

08:31.811 --> 08:34.544
Look, we and A.P.D. are
looking at all three cases,

08:34.547 --> 08:36.514
But let me be clear:
There is nothing now

08:36.515 --> 08:38.948
That indicates anything other than a coincidence.

08:38.951 --> 08:40.518
- Woman: <i>Any evidence?
- Sheila: What about the other girls?</i>

08:40.520 --> 08:42.820
As of now they're only considered missing persons.

08:42.822 --> 08:47.024
- Details are in your handout.
- Sheila: When are you gonna admit

08:47.026 --> 08:49.593
There's somebody taking these girls?

08:49.595 --> 08:51.962
Well, we're investigating any links,

08:51.964 --> 08:54.298
But we don't believe that there's
a mass murderer out there.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.300
That's all we have.
Thank you.

09:27.699 --> 09:29.967
Jack: <i>Somebody went to a lot of trouble getting her there.</i>

09:29.969 --> 09:32.136
<i>There's no road access.</i>
<i>Probably used a boat.</i>

09:32.138 --> 09:34.071
- What, dumped?
- Could have done that closer.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.241
Suspect wanted her out there alive
where they wouldn't be disturbed.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.143
He shot her four times--
two in the legs,

09:39.145 --> 09:41.712
Two in the chest, like she was running.
Then he redressed her,

09:41.714 --> 09:43.247
Wrapped a bandage around her head.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.116
- Shell case is a .223.
- So what are we looking at?

09:46.118 --> 09:48.319
Picked her up from a bar, over an hour drive to a boat.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.354
All the time they're neither seen or missed.

09:50.356 --> 09:52.189
He's nocturnal, methodical.

09:52.191 --> 09:54.625
Probably works nights.
His job gives him time.

09:54.627 --> 09:55.960
Like--
like a shift worker.

09:55.962 --> 09:58.195
Christ, that's half the people here.

09:58.197 --> 10:01.165
But why leave a shell?
It doesn't fit.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.767
I don't think he's careless, more overconfident.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.170
He didn't count on the body being found.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.238
Like the others.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.773
What others?

10:09.775 --> 10:11.275
Lieutenant, this was
too well-planned.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.344
It's not a first time.
It's not a one-off.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.613
He's done it before, he'll do it again.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.348
Dispatcher:
<i>Lieutenant, I have a call--</i>

10:17.350 --> 10:19.883
- I'm not here. Give me 10 minutes.
- Just got this from A.P.D.

10:19.885 --> 10:23.320
one of the missing girls' sisters
called, wants to talk to someone.

10:23.322 --> 10:26.690
This also for whoever's heading
up the missing dancer's case.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.092
Said it's urgent.

10:30.195 --> 10:32.796
No, I'm the wrong guy to get in the middle of this.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.699
- This is my last two weeks.
- Well, bad luck.

10:35.701 --> 10:38.335
Your precious oil money and 800
miles of pipe ain't going anywhere.

10:38.337 --> 10:39.970
Pull whatever team you need.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.406
<i>( door slams, engine starts )</i>

10:52.183 --> 10:54.184
How many open cases has he got?

10:54.186 --> 10:57.287
With hunters, hikers, boaters
and idiots just wandering off,

10:57.289 --> 11:00.090
About 600 from the last two years.

11:00.092 --> 11:01.759
600.

11:03.428 --> 11:06.196
All right. Let's get started. Grab a box.

11:54.446 --> 11:57.347
- Jodi, I'm going to that photo session.
- Fuck! Can you wait?

11:57.349 --> 12:00.317
- Cab's already here. Can I borrow this?
- Only if you drop off my mail.

12:00.319 --> 12:03.287
- Deb, have you seen my necklace?
- Uh... No, I haven't.

12:03.289 --> 12:06.156
- What time will you be back?
- <i>Not till later. I'll meet yu at the bar.</i>

12:20.438 --> 12:22.339
Hi, I'm Debbie.

12:22.341 --> 12:26.176
Sorry I'm late. I brought my dog if that's okay.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.045
( dog whimpers )

12:41.826 --> 12:45.362
<i>- ( country music playing )</i>
<i>- ♪ ...Deep inside</i>

12:45.364 --> 12:48.532
<i>♪ give my love to you--</i>

12:50.468 --> 12:52.503
- <i>Oh hey, Bobby.</i>
<i>- Hey, Al, good morning.</i>

12:52.505 --> 12:54.772
Hey, John says the coyotes are running.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.473
I was thinkin' about taking the boys,

12:56.475 --> 12:58.475
- Flying up, getting a few?
- Maybe next week.

12:58.477 --> 13:01.812
I sure would like to. We're still on
for dinner with Joan, yeah, Tuesday?

13:01.814 --> 13:03.180
If that's what the girls arranged.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.015
- You know, whatever they say.
- Yeah. ( laughs )

13:06.050 --> 13:08.051
- Oh hey, Bob.
- Hi.

13:08.053 --> 13:10.087
Morning.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.156
Good mornin', Bob.

13:13.424 --> 13:14.958
- Hi.
- Woman: <i>Hey.</i>

13:14.960 --> 13:16.493
- Oh no!
- I know.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.829
I can never seem to get the hang of this, Bob.

13:20.398 --> 13:22.366
More pressure.
Like that.

13:22.368 --> 13:23.433
Oh nice.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.271
- Did that clausen order come in?
- It did.

13:27.273 --> 13:29.873
They called and changed it to today, but I can handle it.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.208
Okay.
Do that, please.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.876
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Hey, I got that.</i>

13:32.878 --> 13:35.145
- I'll sort that out for you, Bob.
- Okay, thank you.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.481
- You wanna take one of these home?
- I sure do.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.384
Okay. Are we still having Halloween here?

13:40.386 --> 13:42.452
- You betcha we are.
- My kids are all excited.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.221
- Are they? That's good.
- Yep.

13:44.223 --> 13:46.557
- All right, keep at it now.
- All right. See ya.

13:50.495 --> 13:53.831
I'm going over suspects from court and rape-center cases.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.366
I'll check the rest in the morning.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.368
Are you stayin'?

13:58.370 --> 14:01.238
You have anything
on a Robert c. Hansen?

14:02.240 --> 14:04.441
Grabbed some girl back in '71.

14:04.443 --> 14:07.845
Drove her at gunpoint, hands bound and
naked, to Kenai lake and then raped her.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.980
He got five years, he was out in three months.

14:09.982 --> 14:12.282
It seems he just had a run-in with a prostitute.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.885
She told Anchorage police the exact same story.

14:14.887 --> 14:17.120
- Why isn't this guy on our list?
- <i>That was 12 years ago.</i>

14:17.122 --> 14:19.857
- If we open it up that much--
- Get everything you can from archive.

14:19.859 --> 14:24.394
- And check all missing persons from the same period.
- <i>( Elevator dings )</i>

14:24.396 --> 14:27.231
- Do you know anyone downtown-- vice?
- Yeah, one guy. Why?

14:27.233 --> 14:29.233
- I need a meet. Tonight.
- Got it.

14:29.235 --> 14:32.402
Eight girls in the last two years--
all late teens, early 20s,

14:32.404 --> 14:36.406
5'2 " to 5'7", 120-125 lbs,
all made big money dates

14:36.408 --> 14:38.375
With a stranger and then disappeared.

14:41.913 --> 14:44.915
Cindy Paulson, 23, 5'2", 120 lbs

14:44.917 --> 14:47.951
Was offered $200 for a blowjob
and then raped at gunpoint.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.220
Guy said he liked to take pictures,

14:50.222 --> 14:52.890
Was gonna take her to his cabin
in the wild, but she got away.

14:52.892 --> 14:57.060
There's not one lead on any of these girls, except her.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.629
Wherever she is, we need to find her.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.098
- He's on. You want me to come?
- Jack: <i>No.</i>

15:01.100 --> 15:04.534
Go back through all the older files and see
if there are any other girls that match.

15:14.612 --> 15:16.680
<i>( traffic noise )</i>

15:21.586 --> 15:24.021
- Man: Let me guess.
- Gentile?

15:24.023 --> 15:26.323
Halcombe.
Thanks for helping.

15:26.325 --> 15:28.558
The night's still young.
Don't thank me yet.

15:28.560 --> 15:32.329
Here, put this on.
Take this shit off.

15:32.331 --> 15:36.166
There, now you look like an eighth-grade
teacher out looking for a perv.

15:36.168 --> 15:39.036
I gotta warn you. You're not gonna make many friends

15:39.038 --> 15:40.604
For reopening up this case,

15:40.606 --> 15:42.472
Not down here.
Word travels fast.

15:42.474 --> 15:46.043
Whoever gave you that file just
fucked his next promotion...

15:46.045 --> 15:48.612
And your career.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.181
They call it the track, like for horses.

15:51.183 --> 15:54.618
The ho-stro-- where the ho's stroll.
Everyone knows everyone.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.955
All the pimps know all the other
pimps, who owns which girls,

15:57.957 --> 15:59.523
Which girls are the wild ones.

15:59.525 --> 16:02.159
Black girls are boosters,
whites are flat-backs.

16:02.161 --> 16:05.395
Good money-earning bitch can do
both-- their words not mine.

16:05.397 --> 16:08.365
It's move and hustle.
Give the least, get the most.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.100
You know, it's all about the paper.

16:12.503 --> 16:14.204
Let's dance.

16:15.239 --> 16:16.974
I checked around.
Before here,

16:16.976 --> 16:19.209
Cindy was arrested under p&l in Portland.

16:19.211 --> 16:22.312
Has priors for prostitution in cali, Washington,

16:22.314 --> 16:23.981
Oregon and Denver.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.416
She's been on the street since she was 11 years old.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.719
Quite a track star.
Pimp's a Clayton Jackson.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.221
S.F.P.D. Had him
for trying to rearrange

16:31.223 --> 16:34.157
His last girl's face with a tire iron, but he got off.

16:34.159 --> 16:37.160
( exhales ) real nice piece of fuckin' work.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.196
<i>( rock music playing )</i>

16:40.665 --> 16:43.633
Some of these bars are part of a
mob circuit run out of Seattle.

16:43.635 --> 16:46.069
They move the girls around, L.A., Portland,

16:46.071 --> 16:48.638
Up here, Hawaii, Florida.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.441
Sometimes with no notice, they're just gone.

16:51.443 --> 16:53.010
It keeps the talent fresh.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.445
( whistling, hooting )

17:04.355 --> 17:06.522
Have you seen this girl?

17:06.525 --> 17:08.025
Have you seen her?

17:08.027 --> 17:11.795
- Have you seen this girl?
- Nah, just started.

17:21.705 --> 17:23.540
Her name's Cindy.

17:25.276 --> 17:27.511
If she's street, we keep 'em outta here.

17:27.512 --> 17:28.612
Might've come in.
I dunno.

17:28.614 --> 17:31.214
Try the sleeping lady.
Maybe she's there.

17:31.216 --> 17:34.551
Wait a minute. Have you seen her? Her name's Paula.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.486
She was a walk-in.

17:36.488 --> 17:38.688
Not on the circuit or nothin'.

17:38.690 --> 17:41.058
Said her name was angel.
They all do.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.160
First night she went all the way.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.762
Kept her heels on, going for the big money.

17:45.764 --> 17:48.698
That takes guts.
Not many girls do that.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.168
Hey look, I know what you're thinking.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.770
They're not whores really.
Just girls.

17:53.772 --> 17:56.073
- Janet.
- I gotta go.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.176
- Boss says back inside.
- She's doin' him a favor. Fuck off.

18:01.279 --> 18:03.113
Not any more.
Fuck off.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.348
( chuckles ) okay, big boy.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.317
Move on.

18:08.419 --> 18:10.620
<i>If she's here, we'll find her.</i>

18:10.622 --> 18:12.823
I'll look around a couple more hours.

18:17.628 --> 18:19.629
Mrs. Morehead?
Sergeant Halcombe.

18:19.631 --> 18:22.199
I was told you had some information about your sister.

18:22.201 --> 18:23.667
I do.

18:23.669 --> 18:26.336
Lyle asked me for these a long time ago.

18:26.338 --> 18:29.840
- They're sussie's dental records.
- Okay.

18:31.509 --> 18:33.777
She only came up for two weeks, you know?

18:33.779 --> 18:36.379
That was 15 months ago.

18:36.381 --> 18:38.148
She left her daughter Lizzie

18:38.150 --> 18:40.817
With our folks.

18:41.752 --> 18:43.753
She's four.

18:45.189 --> 18:47.591
Every time the phone rings I think it might be her.

18:49.627 --> 18:50.894
Oh...

18:57.368 --> 18:59.569
We won those when we were kids.

19:00.538 --> 19:02.439
It's a pair.

19:02.441 --> 19:05.842
And sussie never took hers off.

19:09.380 --> 19:12.249
Mrs. Morehead,
I know how you feel.

19:13.784 --> 19:16.920
I know. We're doing everything we can to find her.

19:22.393 --> 19:25.262
( laughs )

19:25.264 --> 19:26.763
Sergeant,

19:27.832 --> 19:29.699
I know it's selfish,

19:29.701 --> 19:32.669
But I want you to remember her

19:32.671 --> 19:34.604
Over the others.

19:37.742 --> 19:40.844
I just want to find her and lay her down somewhere nice.

19:44.248 --> 19:46.816
- I understand.
- You keep that.

19:54.759 --> 19:56.393

Anything from the FBI?

20:36.835 --> 20:39.869
Yeah, he's been searching court
records and nothing from them yet.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.771
Somebody's looking out for you.

20:41.773 --> 20:44.507
She's pretty scared. Won't say
where she's living or working.

20:44.509 --> 20:46.977
- Will she talk?
- I don't know. That's up to you.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.813

$200 for a--

22:32.583 --> 22:34.951

He brought me to his place.

He said his family was away.

22:40.959 --> 22:43.793
Um, and he--

that I was getting out of there,

28:14.993 --> 28:17.293

would escape,

- Come back here, girl. Come back here.
- Hey, handsome, fuck off!

29:28.867 --> 29:31.100
What? My money's no good?
Fuck you, bitch!

29:32.436 --> 29:35.104
Are you fucking crazy, honey?
You ain't got no man?

29:35.106 --> 29:37.206
Look.

29:37.208 --> 29:41.144
Honey, I don't know your story and I ain't gonna ask you,

29:41.146 --> 29:44.013
But you gotta get the fuck off the street. Maybe dance.

29:44.015 --> 29:47.350
- You can dance, huh?
- Yeah.

29:47.352 --> 29:50.887
Listen, honey, I don't want nothing from you,

29:50.889 --> 29:52.889
But I've seen girls like you before.

29:52.891 --> 29:56.192
I've fuckin' been like you, okay? Only
I was too stupid to take some help.

29:56.194 --> 29:58.494
You're gonna take some help. Let's go.

30:00.364 --> 30:02.532
<i>( rock music playing )</i>

30:07.070 --> 30:10.239
It's courvoisier--
French cognac.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.074
It softens the edges.

30:17.014 --> 30:19.448
My grandma was from France, I think.

30:19.450 --> 30:22.318
- I'm like part Irish-French.
- Really?

30:22.320 --> 30:24.887
I'm Brooklyn-trailer.

30:34.898 --> 30:38.134
All right. There are two cases down the Kenai in '71.

30:38.136 --> 30:42.238
Hansen had a boat over the fourth of
July weekend in seward in '73 and '75.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.041
I cross check it each time a girl disappears.

30:45.043 --> 30:48.411
<i>He gets five years for theft in '76.</i>

30:48.413 --> 30:50.847
Supreme court overturned it, he got out in 15 months.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.416
Okay.

30:53.418 --> 30:56.185
Kenai, seward,

30:56.187 --> 30:58.588
'75 kidnapping in Palmer here.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.523
Bear lady found here in 1980.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.959
<i>Another near Eklutna.</i>

31:02.961 --> 31:04.560
Sherry morrow found on the knik here.

31:04.562 --> 31:07.430
Since then 11 girls matching the profile

31:07.432 --> 31:09.065
<i>Have gone missing from downtown.</i>

31:09.067 --> 31:11.500
Now, I've only gone through
half the files, but that's--

31:11.502 --> 31:13.436
That's 150-,
200-mile radius,

31:13.438 --> 31:16.105
So if he is our guy, he's covering
a fair part of the state.

31:16.107 --> 31:19.442
Wait, just slow down here.
These are all old cases.

31:19.444 --> 31:22.078
You got one body and if you wanna start connecting 'em,

31:22.080 --> 31:23.913
You need more than a guess.

31:23.915 --> 31:26.415
- And who the hell is this bear lady?
- ( Unison ) joanna--

31:26.417 --> 31:30.319
Joanna messina. She was a young, unemployed nurse-- shot.

31:30.321 --> 31:33.923
Found frozen and being eaten
by a 500-lb black bear.

31:33.925 --> 31:36.559
- The boys had to shoot it.
- And they got the guy on that.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.594
No. Passed a polygraph,
no conviction.

31:38.596 --> 31:41.497
She matches the profile, she stays on the list.

31:41.499 --> 31:44.667
Well, I got a call from the brass at A.P.D.
and they are pissed off.

31:44.669 --> 31:48.471
They wanna know why the hell we're looking
at cases that they already closed.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.973
Is she even gonna testify?

31:50.975 --> 31:54.243
- I don't know yet.
- Well, Christ, Jack, you better fucking make sure.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.512
And stay away from the A.P.D.

31:56.514 --> 32:00.449
if this thing falls apart, we'll all
be looking at jobs in oil companies.

32:01.451 --> 32:03.552
Shit.

32:03.554 --> 32:07.056
They just found another body--
a mile from the last one.

32:28.278 --> 32:29.679
( coughs )

32:35.452 --> 32:37.119
( clears throat )

32:37.121 --> 32:39.355
What have you got?

32:39.357 --> 32:40.957
No fingerprints left.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.059
Facial dilapidation.

32:43.061 --> 32:45.227
Still some larvae infestation.

32:45.229 --> 32:48.364
Considerable trauma from animals. You can see the tears.

32:48.366 --> 32:50.299
The flesh was tough.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.668
Say she's 20s, early 30s.

32:52.670 --> 32:55.471
Jaw intact so might get an I.D. If you can get me dental.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.606
And how did she die?

32:57.608 --> 33:00.576
Fatal gunshot wound to the sternum.

33:00.578 --> 33:03.312
Bullet entered front and passed clean through her heart,

33:03.314 --> 33:05.348
Exited right shoulder blade.

33:05.350 --> 33:08.551
Also other shots to leg
and torso-- all from behind.

33:08.553 --> 33:10.987
Lacerations to skull,

33:10.989 --> 33:13.422
Deep stabs to the ribs.

33:13.424 --> 33:15.524
She put up quite a fight.

33:15.526 --> 33:18.361
Shirt and bra both cut open in the front.

33:18.363 --> 33:20.563
What do you make of this?

33:20.565 --> 33:24.000
Ever try to saw a bone with a flat blade?

33:24.002 --> 33:27.069
I'd say someone tried to remove her head.

33:29.272 --> 33:31.073
How long was she out there?

33:31.075 --> 33:33.209
Maybe four months,

33:33.211 --> 33:34.777
As few as two.

33:34.779 --> 33:37.380
She spent the summer out there.

33:38.415 --> 33:40.616
Have you ever seen anybody

33:40.618 --> 33:43.052
Do anything like this before?

33:43.054 --> 33:45.087
No.

33:45.089 --> 33:47.323
Neither have I.

34:01.738 --> 34:03.672
Girl:
<i>We waited up.</i>

34:03.674 --> 34:06.709
Mommy's asleep.
She said you didn't call.

34:06.711 --> 34:09.578
Oh!
Yeah, I should've called.

34:09.580 --> 34:12.380
Let's go back to bed.

34:14.251 --> 34:16.585
Don't ever grow up, honey, okay?

34:17.721 --> 34:20.623
Okay, so listen.
You don't cheat us,

34:20.625 --> 34:22.757
And we won't cheat you.
Okay?

34:22.760 --> 34:25.127
We're gonna split
everything 50-50.

34:25.129 --> 34:27.797
( pants ) the fuck, man?

34:27.799 --> 34:29.532
I don't know if I can do this.

34:29.534 --> 34:31.600
I mean turning a trick on the street is one thing,

34:31.601 --> 34:34.136
But getting up there and letting it all hang loose

34:34.138 --> 34:36.772
- In front of a fucking room, I-- - You're gonna be fine.

34:36.774 --> 34:39.675
- You just need some help.
- ( Groans )

34:39.677 --> 34:43.079
Now listen, I remember the first
time I got up on stage, okay?

34:43.081 --> 34:46.614
I was so nervous, I peed all over
this cowboy in the front row.

34:46.617 --> 34:48.451
( chuckles )

34:48.453 --> 34:50.485
Come on.

34:50.487 --> 34:51.786
What's the matter?

34:51.789 --> 34:54.523
You never met crystal before?

34:54.525 --> 34:56.859
She's gonna be your best friend.

34:58.261 --> 34:59.795
<i>Go ahead.</i>

35:02.799 --> 35:05.301
- ( sniffles )
- <i>( Lighter clicks )</i>

35:05.303 --> 35:07.536
Ready? You get it nice and hot.

35:09.172 --> 35:11.507
- You got it?
- ( Coughs )

35:11.509 --> 35:13.409
Come on, you gotta try again. One more time.

35:14.644 --> 35:16.879
There you go.

35:16.881 --> 35:19.381
There you go.
It's good.

35:19.383 --> 35:21.817
- ( gasps )
- <i>Yeah.</i>

35:21.819 --> 35:23.886
( both laugh )

35:25.322 --> 35:27.223
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you're better.

35:27.225 --> 35:28.791
You're good now.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.227
- ( giggling )
- Take this off.

35:31.229 --> 35:33.295
- Look at you.
- Oh my God!

35:33.297 --> 35:36.332
You're fucking gorgeous.
Look at you. Look at you!

35:36.334 --> 35:37.733
Oh fuck.

35:39.636 --> 35:42.204
- You need good shoes, okay?
- Oh my God, these shoes.

35:42.206 --> 35:44.573
- Those are good shoes.
- Oh, I got shoes.

35:44.575 --> 35:46.242
( laughs )

35:46.244 --> 35:47.676
- <i>You good?</i>
<i>- I'm good.</i>

35:47.678 --> 35:49.845
Yeah?

35:53.450 --> 35:55.584
You remind me of my mom.

35:55.586 --> 35:57.920
Fuck you!
Remind you of your mother!

35:57.922 --> 36:00.856
- You do.
- You're so beautiful.

36:00.858 --> 36:04.493
You just go out there, you listen to the music, okay?

36:04.495 --> 36:06.462
That's it.
Just listen to the music.

36:06.464 --> 36:08.697
- Listen to the music.
- Yeah, you're gonna be fine.

36:08.699 --> 36:09.698
You're gonna do just fine.

- You won't get hurt. Get in the plane. - ( Gun cocks )

38:42.386 --> 38:44.887
- ( slaps ) look at me. Get going.
- No!

38:44.889 --> 38:46.822
Shhh.
Don't say anything!

38:46.824 --> 38:48.824
Get in that fucking plane.

Yeah yeah, hey, Jerry.

39:30.401 --> 39:33.102
Yes yes, I'm still joining you, of course.

<i>You'll get them today.</i>

39:34.805 --> 39:37.039
Bye.

39:42.779 --> 39:44.947
- Hey.
- You hear from Cindy?

39:44.949 --> 39:46.648
Gentile said it's too early.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.617
You know I never asked for this case.

39:48.619 --> 39:50.786
Well, I'm glad you're on it.
So are the guys too.

39:50.788 --> 39:53.922
- What'd you find?
- Hansen's alibi is still holding out.

39:53.924 --> 39:57.092
There's no cabin in his name.
Apparently all his trophies

39:57.094 --> 39:58.827
And furs were stolen a few years back.

39:58.829 --> 40:00.929
He used the insurance pay-out
to buy a new plane.

40:00.931 --> 40:03.899
So I ran the cross-check against our
subjects, see who has a pilot's license.

40:03.901 --> 40:06.969
They denied it for psychiatric
reasons, but that didn't stop him.

40:06.971 --> 40:09.138
- He's the only one who owns a plane.
- Psychiatric reasons?

40:09.140 --> 40:12.441
- When's surveillance start?
- Without evidence it's still not approved,

40:12.443 --> 40:14.777
- So we're on our own. Some of the guys might help.
- Good.

40:14.779 --> 40:17.112
I called to get Cindy's evidence
from the Anchorage police.

40:17.114 --> 40:19.848
- ( engine cranking )
- They said they couldn't find her rape exam results.

40:19.850 --> 40:23.752
After they let her go, they never
bothered to get it from the hospital.

40:23.754 --> 40:27.022
- <i>It's still there.
- This fucker kidnaps, rapes and tortures</i>

40:27.024 --> 40:29.691
A 17 year-old girl, not to mention how many others,

40:29.693 --> 40:32.728
And I'll bet these guys and the D.A.
all but bought him lunch

40:32.730 --> 40:35.597
For the inconvenience of asking him questions about it.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.599
Make it official.
We're reopening the case.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.635
Metro can think whatever the fuck they want.

40:39.637 --> 40:42.471
This guy did it and they let him get away with it.

It's their special.

44:24.994 --> 44:27.963
The other night you said you saw a hole in the post.

44:29.165 --> 44:30.766
Why'd you say a bullet hole?

44:33.002 --> 44:35.003
Cindy?

44:35.005 --> 44:38.206
Um, because I seen one before.

44:38.208 --> 44:40.375
What do you mean?
When?

44:40.377 --> 44:42.110
Shit, I dunno.

44:42.112 --> 44:45.814
One Christmas when I was
like six years old my--

44:45.816 --> 44:49.051
My pop shot his gun inside and left
a hole right there in the wall.

44:49.053 --> 44:50.285
It looked just the same.

44:51.454 --> 44:53.321
Have you ever seen a glacier?

44:53.323 --> 44:56.925
Or, like, you love animals or anything?

44:56.927 --> 44:59.428

<i>Watch out!</i>

45:00.296 --> 45:01.930
I always dreamed that one day

45:01.932 --> 45:04.199
I would either be a fireman or work with animals.

45:04.201 --> 45:06.435
It'd be so cool.

45:08.104 --> 45:09.905
Where's your family?

45:12.408 --> 45:14.776
Why you want to know that shit, huh?

45:16.012 --> 45:18.280
'cause you're just like all the other squares.

45:18.282 --> 45:20.315
I got guys asking me all the time what happened,

45:20.317 --> 45:22.384
Where my folks think I'm at.

45:22.386 --> 45:25.253
You wanna fuck me?
Is that what you want?

45:25.255 --> 45:27.389
( clears throat ) no, Cindy, I don't.

45:27.391 --> 45:29.858
You think-- you think
knowing makes us friends?

45:29.860 --> 45:31.727
Makes me help you?

45:31.729 --> 45:33.495
What happened to your sister?

45:35.364 --> 45:37.833
Yeah, see? Fuck that.

45:37.835 --> 45:39.735
I ain't a friend.
I ain't nothing.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.470
I just thought if you might wanna go home,

45:41.472 --> 45:43.438
- Maybe I could find a way--
- Fuck, man.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.507
Are you fucking for real?

45:45.509 --> 45:48.243
What the fuck do you think I'm gonna do there, huh?

45:48.245 --> 45:50.145
Say "here's my nigger"?

45:50.147 --> 45:53.315
"oh, you didn't know I been a
ho since like the sixth grade?

45:53.317 --> 45:56.752
Some dumb pimp's bitch?" they
didn't raise me for that shit.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.320
You can't always be on the run.

45:58.322 --> 46:01.022
You don't think I wanna be here.

46:01.024 --> 46:03.792
I can go home any time I want.

46:03.794 --> 46:06.094
- Maybe I don't want to.
- Don't you care?

46:06.096 --> 46:08.530
Your parents might be worried about you.

46:11.033 --> 46:13.201
Yeah.
Yeah, they're worried.

46:13.203 --> 46:15.470
Like they should have
done that when--

46:15.472 --> 46:18.473
Those motherfuckers.

46:22.011 --> 46:25.981
I had shit happen to me that ain't
supposed to happen to no little kids,

46:25.983 --> 46:28.350
And they just let it.

46:28.352 --> 46:30.519
They fucking let it.

46:30.521 --> 46:33.121
They wanted to hide me.

46:33.123 --> 46:36.391
It's-- it's-- it's not right to
be ashamed of your baby, is it?

46:36.393 --> 46:38.426
To let bad things happen to it?

46:41.030 --> 46:43.198
I didn't ask for any of that shit.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.500
And you want me to go back to it?

46:48.237 --> 46:50.438
I'm fucking outta here.
I don't need your shit no more.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.374
<i>I'll see you around.</i>

46:52.376 --> 46:56.144
It took them two hours to cut her out of the car.

46:58.881 --> 47:01.550
The guy was a drunk driver.

47:03.419 --> 47:05.187
<i>It was my 21st birthday.</i>

47:07.523 --> 47:09.925
She had knitted me this...
( chuckles )

47:09.927 --> 47:11.827
Awful orange scarf

47:11.829 --> 47:14.262
And told me how proud she was of me and then ran out.

47:20.403 --> 47:23.572
I wanna think Sandy didn't see
it when he smashed into her.

47:23.574 --> 47:26.241
But anyway, I went with her to the hospital.

47:28.945 --> 47:31.313
I don't know if she
knew I was there--

47:31.315 --> 47:33.515
Just holding her hand.

47:34.851 --> 47:36.885
I kept telling her she'd be all right.

47:40.056 --> 47:42.290
Right up until she died.

47:45.394 --> 47:47.529

- And we know who he is.
- Yeah, but you can't prove it.

He'll be keeping mementoes, trophies.

Metro saw ace bandages in his car,

50:32.062 --> 50:34.562

Shells don't kill people.
Bullets and people do.

None of this holds.

I don't know how much longer she'll be safe out there.

Bring her in. Arrest her if you have to.
Put her in a safe house.

50:46.476 --> 50:48.576
She won't help if I do that.
She'll run and I can't make her.

50:48.578 --> 50:51.579
What about the insurance fraud? Is
that enough to get him off the street?

50:51.581 --> 50:54.082
If you bring him in, he'll probably call
his lawyer and refuse to cooperate.

50:54.084 --> 50:56.584
You need more. Look, I'm not going to
tell you how to do your job, okay?

50:56.586 --> 50:58.753

Is with you,

If you'll help me.

52:31.381 --> 52:33.848
Now I know you stopped what was happening to you

52:33.850 --> 52:35.783
When you were growing up by running.

52:35.785 --> 52:37.685
This time you stop it for them.

But you gotta stay.

52:48.898 --> 52:52.200
( sighs ) well, I wasn't an officer then.

52:52.202 --> 52:55.403
The judge gave him six years
for murdering a beautiful girl.

52:55.405 --> 52:58.239
He was out in two. I know where
he lives, I know what he does.

52:59.575 --> 53:02.644
Not a day goes by, I don't think about her... Or him.

53:02.646 --> 53:03.945
Yeah, but he got away.

53:03.947 --> 53:06.748
Look, Cindy, Hansen won't.

53:06.750 --> 53:08.783
You gotta trust me.

53:09.752 --> 53:12.353
I promise, okay?

No no, she's not.
She's not our kid!

Well, she's someone's. And no one
cares and this guy knows it.

You know Frank rothschild.
I asked him to join us.

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:30.697
- I hope you've got something new.
- Legal affidavit

01:09:30.698 --> 01:09:33.800
And search warrant request that covers Hansen's history,

01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:36.370
Lists items we expect to find in his home, his work,

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.337
His vehicles, including his plane.

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.541
From the FBI's new profiling team.

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:42.843
They say we're looking for a white male, early 40s,

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.245
Average height, respected member of the community,

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:47.314
Wife probably very religious

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:49.649
And not totally aware of what he's up to,

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:53.687
History of theft, sexual assault, probably stutters.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:57.691
Also expert outdoorsman and avid hunter.

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:59.726
That's Hansen.

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:03.530
This is all secondhand information.
I need physical evidence.

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:05.265
These guys aren't even proven yet.

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:06.967
Hell, the FBI can't work out if they're for real.

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:09.803
I have testimony from another victim who escaped in '79,

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:12.873
And a witness who has seen Hansen's
stolen trophy heads back in his den.

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:16.743
We have Cindy Paulson and everything
I had last time still checks out.

01:10:16.745 --> 01:10:20.347
- Who wrote this?
- Pat doogan, assistant district attorney Fairbanks.

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:22.783
He flew down yesterday, worked through the night.

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:24.785
- You behind this, Bob?
- And the colonel.

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:26.787
<i>So you still want to search for insurance fraud,</i>

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:28.956
Use that warrant to get him on murder? That washes out,

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:31.558
Gets thrown out of court, then what?

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:35.529
Every way we turn it all leads back to Hansen.

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:37.898
Now I'm not gonna tell you how to do your job,

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.367
But if you don't start doing something,

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:42.769
You'll be the one held responsible for these,

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:45.405
And any other girls who are killed.

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:48.709
Now if you'll excuse me, I should
probably check on miss Paulson.

01:10:49.844 --> 01:10:51.778
Sergeant.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.748
We'll look these over, get back to you in a few days.

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.783
You know...

01:10:56.785 --> 01:10:59.987
He stalks them like his next trophy animal,

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:02.389
He rapes them and he kills them.

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:04.491
He is probably doing it right now.

01:11:04.493 --> 01:11:06.793
We don't have a few days!

01:11:06.795 --> 01:11:09.296
I want a warrant.

01:11:09.298 --> 01:11:10.664
Now!

01:11:13.735 --> 01:11:16.703
If he's wrong, if this guy gets off...

01:11:17.939 --> 01:11:19.840
We'll never get him in again.

01:11:20.808 --> 01:11:22.276
Then unlike in the past,

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.378
We all better make sure that doesn't happen.

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:55.342
I was hoping you could help us down at the station.

01:11:59.981 --> 01:12:03.517
In 1971, there was an incident

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:06.653
Involving a miss Allen over in spenard.

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:08.488
Can you tell me what happened there, Bob?

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.924
Well, um,

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:13.026
That, um-- I don't
know what to say.

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:16.997
I guess you could just...
Call that an urge.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:20.834
And is that to do with what Dr.
Mcmannus said at your sentencing?

01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:24.037
- I can't remember--
- Schizophrenic or manic-depressive problems.

01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:27.641
A mental state you would sometimes go into

01:12:27.643 --> 01:12:29.910
And things would just...
Happen,

01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:33.413
But then you wouldn't remember. Was he off-base on that?

01:12:33.415 --> 01:12:34.881
Is that bothering you, Bob?

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:37.884
Hey, listen, whatever the problem is here,

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:40.420
I want to help you gentlemen clear it up.

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:42.756
You know, but by the same token,

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.925
Uh, my lawyer always told me
never to-- you know.

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:48.895
But I can help you clear it up. What's your question?

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:51.031
- There was a second incident...
- Mm-Hmm.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.866
...In December of '71.

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:54.901
- You were arrested for that also?
- Yeah yeah.

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:57.504
- <i>Her name was bowden.</i>
<i>- That situation,</i>

01:12:57.506 --> 01:13:00.507
There is your basic, you know,

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:03.543
Money for sex...
Prop-proposition.

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:06.446
I said, "look hey, you know, this-- we agreed on a price,

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:09.082
And God damn it, that's the way it's gonna be."

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:11.785
And she just kept arguing with me-- more and more money,

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:13.820
More and more money.
And then, you know,

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:15.589
I just dropped her off in Anchorage.

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:18.558
She says you bound her with a snare
trap and put a gun to her head.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.627
- No.
- And you started going down towards the Kenai

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:22.929
- To the sunset lodge and rented a cabin.
- That part's true.

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:26.600
And she says you raped her. And you wrote
her mother and father's name and address

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:29.636
And her son's name down and said if
she told anyone, you'd harm 'em.

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:32.439
Well, I do remember her name being
written down on a piece of paper

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:35.642
That she gave me to contact her, but I don't remember--

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:37.644

- Okay, I'm on it.
- Please.

01:13:53.961 --> 01:13:56.963
She worked at the embers bar, 1979.

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:59.599
Oh oh, yeah yeah, okay.

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:01.735
Yeah, I remember her.

01:14:01.737 --> 01:14:04.504
That was, uh, primarily the same thing.

01:14:04.506 --> 01:14:06.840
Haven't you learned by now, Bob, that these girls

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:08.708
Aren't just gonna play it cool with you?

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:11.011
I mean, you know that they know

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:13.513
That they have
a commodity that you want--

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:15.615
And with a nice wife at home.

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:18.051
- Is there a problem there?
- No.

01:14:18.053 --> 01:14:20.787
At home there's no problem at all.

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:24.057
I-- I mentioned to you-you
both that, uh...

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.161
Both of these times, uh...

01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:30.130
I wanted oral sex.

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:38.839
But that's not something that I would
want-- want my wife to perform, okay?

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:41.041
You know, not somebody that

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:43.543
I love and respect and--
and cherish and--

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:46.046
We've got all the bank statements, other documents,

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:48.048
Nothing that has anything to do with any girls.

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:50.116
- <i>I'm heading to the plane.</i>
<i>- Okay, good.</i>

01:14:50.118 --> 01:14:53.019
All right. The prostitutes are upset, you're upset.

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:57.057
- Yeah.
- Things can happen in that specific arrangement.

01:14:57.059 --> 01:15:00.093
But let's go back
to miss Allen for a moment--

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:02.496
The young lady over in spenard.

01:15:03.598 --> 01:15:05.832
She worked
for a real-estate company.

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:09.202
Yeah. Well, the first time
I'd seen her she was downtown,

01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:12.973
And I had an attraction to her right away.

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:16.176
So, you know, I followed her home

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:20.146
And, um, she just seemed like a really neat person.

01:15:20.148 --> 01:15:22.616
What happened the second time you went over?

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:24.851
- You had a gun.
- Yeah well...

01:15:26.187 --> 01:15:29.055
I hadn't intended to rape her or anything like that.

01:15:38.132 --> 01:15:39.966
Yeah no.
It's the same.

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:41.801
There's stolen stuff everywhere.

01:15:41.803 --> 01:15:44.804
- Yeah, we got guys out at the camper too.
- <i>I need more</i>

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:46.706
Or he's gonna walk.

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.943
I said to myself,
"you know-- you know, Bob,

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:52.178
You gotta have some
priorities in your life."

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:55.048
When I've done this now, I've done it to my family too.

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:57.117
And I put my wife through an awful lot of grief

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:59.185
And I don't want to do that anymore, okay?

01:15:59.187 --> 01:16:01.922
You took some of these girls out
or you picked 'em up for sex?

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:04.591
- I'm not denying that.
- Yeah, but I'm talking about case after case

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:08.161
Over a period of 12 years. And all these
girls' cases are saying the exact same thing:

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:10.230
"I was bound.
I was threatened."

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:13.066
A gun or knife was involved.

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:16.703
And you're telling me that everybody's
making up the same story?

01:16:18.039 --> 01:16:20.006
I'm showing you a pattern, Bob,

01:16:20.008 --> 01:16:22.342
And you're lying to me.

01:16:25.246 --> 01:16:28.214
Well, it just seems like

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:31.217
You've gone to this untold amount of trouble.

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:34.120
You know, you're bringing up things from my past,

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:36.189
I would be as hard pressed to remember

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:38.191
Back when I was born in Iowa.

01:16:41.829 --> 01:16:44.264
A .223 shell casing
was found at her gravesite.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:46.299
She was shot and killed.

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:48.868
You're telling me I shot this person?

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:51.137
Bullshit!

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:52.639
I did not shoot anybody

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:55.108
And I would not hurt anybody.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:57.344
- And that's the truth.
- Hansen's wife doesn't know anything.

01:16:57.346 --> 01:16:59.145
It's like they live in two separate worlds.

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:01.014
We found his stolen mounts right on the damned wall.

01:17:01.016 --> 01:17:02.816
The .223,
the arrowhead necklace?

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:05.285
Anything that links him directly to one of the girls?

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:07.687
- How's it going with him?
- He still doesn't want a lawyer,

01:17:07.689 --> 01:17:09.389
But he's giving us everything we already know.

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:13.393
The rest is babble. Look, I need the .223 or something!

01:17:20.034 --> 01:17:21.668
Who is that?

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:23.937
That's Sherry morrow.

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:26.906
She was found on the knik with an ace bandage

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:29.643
Wrapped around her face and her arms.

01:17:31.312 --> 01:17:34.014
Or what was left of them.

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:38.151
There was also
a .223 shell casing

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:40.153
Found at her gravesite.

01:17:41.122 --> 01:17:43.657
Identical extractor markings to the shell

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:46.126
- We found at Paula's grave.
- You think that came out of my gun?

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:48.329
- Bullshit it did!
- Why are you telling us that everybody's wrong?

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:51.297
- Because in this case they are.
- You said the psychiatrists were wrong,

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:54.234
But admitted you lied to them and told
us you don't really have a problem.

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:57.103
You're not hearing voices, you're not seeing things.

01:17:57.105 --> 01:17:59.205
And if that's true...

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:01.074
Then there's a far worse problem,

01:18:01.076 --> 01:18:03.943
And it cannot continue.

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:07.080
Well, I'll tell you what. It
can't because it never started.

01:18:08.249 --> 01:18:10.316
I didn't shoot anybody.

01:18:12.153 --> 01:18:13.887
Yeah, we've got 17 weapons so far.

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:17.857
Al's running numbers now,
but none of 'em are a .223.

01:18:19.226 --> 01:18:20.960
Well yeah, it's all as Cindy said,

01:18:20.962 --> 01:18:23.196
But there's no prints, fibers, anything.

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:25.098
Yeah well, we're running out of places to look.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:29.235
Probable insurance fraud.
No, nothing on any girls.

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:32.238
Most of us don't have much respect for a prostitute.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.207
They're beneath us, aren't they?

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:36.943
- I think so.
- Why are they beneath us, Bob?

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:39.779
Well, it's obvious.

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:43.316
Didn't you find, growing up, that
girls had a certain power over you?

01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:46.453
They know what boys want and they
can dictate when they can have it.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.422
Isn't it nice when we get older
and we can turn the tables,

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:51.391
Dominate, take the lead?
Isn't it?

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:54.260
Determine when you touch them or whatever?

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:56.429
- When you pay for it.
- <i>Right.</i>

01:18:56.431 --> 01:18:59.199
And they won't reject you.
You're paying for it,

01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:01.735
They'll do what you tell them.
Then you pull out the gun

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:03.369
And you're really in control.

01:19:05.239 --> 01:19:07.073
Then they're dead.

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:10.176
Now you say you didn't rape them,
you say you didn't shoot them,

01:19:10.178 --> 01:19:12.245
But turn it around, Bob.
If you'd read those reports--

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:13.913
Turn it around,
pretend you're us--

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:16.249
Would you think those girls lied?

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:18.451
- I believe them.
- Well, do you want to convict me on that?!

01:19:18.453 --> 01:19:20.420
I wanna find out who I'm talking to.

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:23.456
I want to see if you have the guts to be honest with me!

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:25.458
You know what?

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.394
I think that this is serious as hell,

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:32.031
And I think that I'd like to talk to my attorney.

01:19:32.033 --> 01:19:35.869
If you wanna talk about
all this back-passing stuff--

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:39.372
And about that?
I didn't do that!

01:19:50.785 --> 01:19:53.086
You think you got away with what you did to Cindy.

01:19:54.388 --> 01:19:56.489
I know what you do to those girls.

01:19:58.092 --> 01:20:01.227
- And I'm gonna prove it.
- That's gonna be hard, sergeant.

01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:04.531
- I heard you were leaving.
- I'm not going anywhere yet.

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:07.267
Robert Hansen, I'm arresting you

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:09.269
For the kidnap and rape of Cindy Paulson.

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:11.538
Read him the rest and get him over to the courthouse.

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.907
Robert Christian Hansen...

01:20:17.444 --> 01:20:20.446
Fucking son of a bitch!
Is there anything from her?

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:23.917
- The truck, the plane?
- Maybe he did dump it all already.

01:20:36.297 --> 01:20:38.364
Can you guys give me a minute?

01:21:09.396 --> 01:21:11.464
- ( sobbing )
- ( Growls )

01:21:16.237 --> 01:21:19.405
Halcombe: Gentlemen, I know you've been at this all day,

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:21.908
But we still haven't found what we need.

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:24.510
And if we don't before we leave,

01:21:24.512 --> 01:21:26.145
We'll never get another chance.

01:21:26.147 --> 01:21:28.982
So we're gonna start again.

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:31.451
From top to bottom, every damn inch.

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:34.120
If it means we stay all night,
dig up the entire property,

01:21:34.122 --> 01:21:36.189
Well, that's what we're gonna do!

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:39.425
Call it trooper's intuition.
I know it's here.

01:21:39.427 --> 01:21:41.661
All right, you heard him.
Let's get to it.

01:21:45.666 --> 01:21:47.467
Hi.

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:49.535
- You okay?
- <i>( Door closes )</i>

01:21:49.537 --> 01:21:50.970
We arrested him.

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:52.538
The judge said no to bail.

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:56.609
What's he doing here? Said you
wanna put me in some safe house.

01:21:56.611 --> 01:21:58.578
- I don't want to.
- You have to, Cindy.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.580
It's for the best.

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:03.316
Well, am I gonna have to testify?

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.218
'cause I don't know if I can face him again.

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.453
His lawyer is going to want to interview you.

01:22:07.455 --> 01:22:11.090
And they're gonna try to make you look bad,

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:12.492
Like--

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:15.695
I just want you to be ready, okay?

01:22:16.664 --> 01:22:19.265
I need to get my stuff.

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:20.633
I've gotta go.

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:22.969
- I said I need to get my stuff!
- Yeah.

01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:25.538
I'll come by tomorrow and we can go get it.

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.607
Anything you want, okay?

01:22:30.678 --> 01:22:33.680
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

01:22:50.364 --> 01:22:52.332
Lieutenant:
<i>Hey, Jack, over here!</i>

01:22:56.704 --> 01:22:59.605
We found a trap door.
You may wanna see this.

01:23:05.713 --> 01:23:08.481
You were right.
He didn't dump it all.

01:23:09.616 --> 01:23:12.685
<i>That's a mini-14</i>
<i>and a thompson contender.</i>

01:23:13.654 --> 01:23:15.688
Both .223s.

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.690
( shouting ) we found the guns!

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:19.592
<i>( cheers )</i>

01:23:38.779 --> 01:23:42.148
Is Cindy okay?
I got her a new toothbrush

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:45.685
And some soap and some things.

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:47.754
We found the gun.

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:49.689
He didn't confess.

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:53.092
( sighs )

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:55.628
Just because the system isn't perfect,

01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:59.499
It doesn't mean you quit trying to make it better.

01:24:02.169 --> 01:24:04.704
I thought a change is what we needed.

01:24:07.107 --> 01:24:08.674
You know what?

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:11.110
I love this old place.

01:24:11.112 --> 01:24:13.646
I'm just gonna go get my job back.

01:24:13.648 --> 01:24:16.716
You've gotta do what's right for you.
And helping this girl...

01:24:17.785 --> 01:24:19.652
This is who you are.

01:24:21.655 --> 01:24:23.823
You can't let this guy get away with it.

01:24:30.631 --> 01:24:32.698
I don't intend to.

01:24:34.802 --> 01:24:37.437
Man: You'll do something minor on the fraud.

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:41.407
But what about this girl, this Cindy?

01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:43.776
I thought you said that was a mistake?

01:24:43.778 --> 01:24:45.611
'cause if she testifies,

01:24:45.613 --> 01:24:47.480
It could be trouble.

01:24:49.316 --> 01:24:50.683
What are you saying?

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:53.786
Well, I'm saying a kidnap and rape charge,

01:24:53.788 --> 01:24:56.189
That could be 99 years right there.

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:59.859
And these types of trials can be a mess...

01:25:01.795 --> 01:25:03.629
For you and your family.

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:05.665
I'll be back in the morning, Bob.

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:07.533
<i>( door slams )</i>

01:25:36.330 --> 01:25:38.397
<i>( music playing on radio )</i>

01:25:57.317 --> 01:25:58.851
<i>( door opens )</i>

01:25:58.853 --> 01:26:00.853
You're Cindy, right?

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:04.657
'cause some guy came in, described
you and asked if Cindy was in town.

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.359
Said he was a friend of Bob's?

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:08.561
<i>I told him you'd be back soon.</i>

01:26:15.569 --> 01:26:17.336
Who's been in to see him?

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:18.871
Man:
<i>Just his lawyer and wife.</i>

01:26:18.873 --> 01:26:20.907
<i>His brother picked up a letter to his kids.</i>

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:23.776
- <i>There was nothing in it.
- Hansen doesn't have a brother.</i>

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:25.745
Has anybody checked on Cindy?

01:26:25.747 --> 01:26:27.880
There's an officer
over there. Why?

01:26:28.749 --> 01:26:30.716
I need to speak to sergeant Halcombe.

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:33.286
Oh, come on, pick up!
Fuck no. Please, come on!

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:34.887
- Well, where-- where is he?
- <i>( Car honks )</i>

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:37.456
- Just connect him, please?
- Clate: <i>Fuck, bitch, come on!</i>

01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:39.892
I've been looking for ya all night!
Get in the fucking car!

01:26:45.465 --> 01:26:48.367
Look, I only told the cops my name was Cindy.

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:50.903
Then I used felisha, okay?
It's him. I know it.

01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:53.839
Look, man, we're getting out of
this motherfucking state tonight!

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:55.808
Never coming back.

01:26:57.244 --> 01:26:59.745
- <i>( phone rings )</i>
<i>- Clate: Hello.</i>

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:01.614
- Thug: <i>You got her?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:03.616
It's now.
Remember,

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:05.451
You do what I told you, we're even.

01:27:08.322 --> 01:27:09.922
( beeps )

01:27:14.661 --> 01:27:16.729
Cindy: Why are you turning here?

01:27:17.698 --> 01:27:19.565
Where the fuck are you taking me?

01:27:20.834 --> 01:27:22.802
Clate, I asked you a question. Where are we going?

01:27:26.807 --> 01:27:28.874
Cindy?

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:31.811
What the hell's the matter with you?
You just let her leave?

01:27:32.746 --> 01:27:33.813
( huffs )

01:27:46.426 --> 01:27:48.294
Get out.

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:50.963
C'mon, get out. Get outta the motherfucking car!

01:27:52.933 --> 01:27:55.635
- Cindy: <i>What's going on?</i>
<i>- Calm your ass down.</i>

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:57.436
Clate, what the fuck is going on?

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:59.972
Just relax.
This will be over soon.

01:28:01.375 --> 01:28:02.675
Get the fuck outta here.

01:28:03.810 --> 01:28:05.811
- We're even.
- ( Gun cocks )

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.847
- No. No!
- Where do you think you're going, huh?

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:10.316
- Where do you think you're going, huh? - ( Sobbing )

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:13.419
- Clate, why are you doing this to me? - ( Gun cocks )

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:14.854
Put the fucking gun down!
Put it down!

01:28:14.856 --> 01:28:16.922
You're a fucking dead man, you do this.

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:19.292
- What the fuck you doing?
- <i>Go get the cash out a the ca.</i>

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:22.561
Ahh, I'm fucking--
I'm fucking better than this.

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:25.665
- Look, bitch, I ain't got time for this.
- I'm better than you!

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:26.832
Come on, not now!

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:28.901
Where the fuck you going?

01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:31.370
There goes your fucking bitch right there.

01:28:31.372 --> 01:28:32.672
You stupid fucker.

01:28:36.643 --> 01:28:38.911
- Where's the fucking money?!
- ( Gunshot )

01:28:41.014 --> 01:28:42.748
( whimpers )

01:28:45.519 --> 01:28:48.321
- I can't find her.
- Dispatcher: <i>Sergeant, I have a call</i>

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:50.356
<i>From a Cindy Paulson for you.</i>

01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:51.757
Put her through!

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:54.460
Look, he's gonna take me.
Help me, please!

01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:02.468
- Go somewhere you know.
- <i>Clate's place, okay?</i>

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:04.437
- <i>Gentlemen's heaven.</i>
<i>- I know where that is.</i>

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:07.006
Just go there. I'll find you. We're on our way.

01:29:14.014 --> 01:29:15.981
Look, he's coming, okay?
I want out!

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:17.950
Just get a room and lock the door.

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:20.052
Hide until I get there.
I'll be there.

01:29:38.672 --> 01:29:41.107
( panting )

01:29:45.145 --> 01:29:46.979
Where the fuck is she?

01:29:51.084 --> 01:29:52.585
<i>( knob rattles )</i>

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:53.652
Shit.

01:29:53.654 --> 01:29:54.987
( growls )

01:30:17.077 --> 01:30:18.644
( screams ) no!

01:30:21.982 --> 01:30:24.917
- ( screams )
- ( Growls )

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.687
Cindy?

01:30:28.689 --> 01:30:30.456
- Cindy?
- Oh hey!

01:30:35.028 --> 01:30:37.096
<i>( muffled screams )</i>

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:39.098
Jack!
Rear fire escape!

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.666
Shut the fuck up.

01:30:43.003 --> 01:30:44.170
Drop the gun!

01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:46.105
Drop the gun!

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:47.706
Drop it!

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:49.141
State troopers!
Drop the gun now!

01:30:49.143 --> 01:30:51.544
( Cindy sobbing )

01:30:51.546 --> 01:30:53.012
Now!

01:30:55.048 --> 01:30:56.615
It's your lucky day, bitch.

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.484
( sobbing continues, thuds )

01:31:19.873 --> 01:31:21.874
I just got word from clives' office.

01:31:21.876 --> 01:31:24.743
It doesn't look like they're gonna
go with the murder charges.

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:27.012
I have the gun!
I have the shells!

01:31:27.014 --> 01:31:28.514
They're just gonna argue that somebody else

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:29.915
Could've pulled the trigger, you know that.

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:31.817
<i>I mean, our warrant's being questioned.</i>

01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:33.986
<i>Without a match on the jewelry he's worried</i>

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:37.022
That it's a gamble that he's
gonna lose and Hansen'll walk.

01:31:37.024 --> 01:31:38.791
Sorry, Jack.
I don't think

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:41.594
We're gonna get a murder indictment unless he confesses.

01:31:43.697 --> 01:31:46.866
Look, you're smarter than he is, right?

01:31:46.868 --> 01:31:49.201
Now remember, when you get a guy like this drowning,

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:51.670
You pour on more water.

01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:55.274
You know, I spent last night, uh,

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:57.676
Looking over everything we seized again.

01:31:57.678 --> 01:31:59.712
We found this behind his bed,

01:31:59.714 --> 01:32:02.248
And the wife said he was always reading it at night.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:05.217
- What are these?
- I don't know.

01:32:18.031 --> 01:32:19.598
<i>What is it?</i>

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:23.035
Ed? Ed!
Where were Eklutna Annie

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:25.170
And joanna messina's bodies found again?

01:32:25.172 --> 01:32:27.773
Eklutna was right here where you have this mark.

01:32:27.775 --> 01:32:30.109
Seward's down here
and the highway runs--

01:32:30.111 --> 01:32:33.012
So joanna was right around here.

01:32:33.014 --> 01:32:34.113
This mark.

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:36.181
Jesus. That's more
than 20 of 'em.

01:32:36.183 --> 01:32:38.150
Oh my God!

01:32:39.753 --> 01:32:41.787
What has he done?

01:32:48.061 --> 01:32:50.129
Was there anything like this found?

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:52.097
Exactly like this?

01:32:52.099 --> 01:32:54.800
This is the one that sue luna's sister gave to me.

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:57.269
She said that sue was wearing an identical one

01:32:57.271 --> 01:32:59.572
The day she disappeared.

01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:01.273
No, there's nothing like that.

01:33:12.118 --> 01:33:15.287
- Yes.
- And I paid the price for that. Okay?

01:33:15.289 --> 01:33:16.822
- Right?
- Lawyer: <i>Yes. Absolutely.</i>

01:33:16.824 --> 01:33:18.657
But just because I did some things in my past,

01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:21.193
Don't say that I've done this here, because I did not!

01:33:21.195 --> 01:33:23.829
- I did not-- I did not kill anyone!
- <i>Okay okay, Bob, just--</i>

01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:25.731
- Bob, just calm down.
- <i>( Door opens )</i>

01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:27.366
Sorry I'm late.

01:33:27.368 --> 01:33:29.868
Bob,

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:31.904
We found this at your house.
Can you tell me what it is?

01:33:33.173 --> 01:33:35.107
I haven't seen this!
What-- what is this?

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:37.643
It's a flight chart. I'm sure
you've seen hundreds of them.

01:33:37.645 --> 01:33:40.245
Right. And what're all these little
markings on it? These "x" s?

01:33:40.247 --> 01:33:42.314
Those are places where I hunt.

01:33:42.316 --> 01:33:45.284
But, Bob, why is this one and this one

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:49.755
- <i>And these two?
- Lawyer: All right, just hold it now.</i>

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:52.224
You're saying-- no way. Those
are just places where I hunted.

01:33:52.226 --> 01:33:54.627
Oh, I believe they were, Bob.

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:56.695
- Places where you've hunted.
- Yep.

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:59.231
And then one night while you were studying this chart,

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:01.333
You added on where you hunted a girl,

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:04.269
And then another and another, until it's
just something you can't leave alone.

01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:06.338
You put these girls out there, didn't you, Bob?

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:11.644
- You had their blood all over your hands and your clothes?
- Sergeant.

01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:15.080
We found the guns. Just a matter of
time before the lab confirms it.

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:16.882
- <i>Well, now just goddamned minute-- - Sergeant!</i>

01:34:16.884 --> 01:34:19.251
That's-- that's him.

01:34:19.253 --> 01:34:21.186
( hyperventilating )

01:34:21.188 --> 01:34:23.322
Pretty bad weather for a flight the other day.

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:25.758
Quite a pilot.

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.693
We almost lost you a few times.

01:34:27.695 --> 01:34:31.130
But we found it.
The tracks were still fresh.

01:34:32.098 --> 01:34:33.399
What is that?

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:35.901
<i>Well, Bob knows.</i>
<i>Don't you, Bob?</i>

01:34:37.237 --> 01:34:39.672
She had a child!

01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:42.808
<i>Almost the same age as your son, Bob.</i>

01:34:44.911 --> 01:34:46.245
What's the matter?
Why are you so quiet?

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:48.313
Don't you remember killing sue luna?

01:34:48.315 --> 01:34:52.084
Did you take it off her before or after you raped her?

01:34:52.086 --> 01:34:54.953
- This meeting's over. I need to talk to my client.
- No, I'm trying to help him.

01:34:54.955 --> 01:34:58.090
You see, we're gonna be taking a close
look at where all these little marks are.

01:34:58.092 --> 01:35:00.826
Now this map has 24 on it,

01:35:00.828 --> 01:35:03.462
Leading us to conclude that there
might be 24 girls out there,

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:06.231
And if we find a body, we're gonna charge him with murder!

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:10.302
Bob, I can't stop it--
you, your family, the media.

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:12.404
The ground's frozen now, but come every summer

01:35:12.406 --> 01:35:14.440
When the snow and the ice melt, I'll keep going

01:35:14.442 --> 01:35:16.241
Until I've checked every last mark.

01:35:16.243 --> 01:35:19.411
I'm going to ask the district
attorney to petition the governor

01:35:19.413 --> 01:35:24.750
With all the bodies we'll find, he'll get it,
so if you don't want to tell us the truth now,

01:35:24.752 --> 01:35:27.286
- We can't help you then!
- You think can threaten me?

01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:29.388
- You think you can threaten me?
- Lawyer: <i>Bob, Bob, Bob!</i>

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:32.024
You think you know who I am? You
don't have any idea who I am!

01:35:41.401 --> 01:35:43.302
You little cunt!

01:35:43.304 --> 01:35:45.971
You think you can threaten me with this little whore?

01:35:45.973 --> 01:35:49.074
- Bob, take it easy!
- I should have killed you when I had the chance!
