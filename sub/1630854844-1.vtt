00:20.498 --> 00:22.761
The impulse to dance
existed long before

00:22.892 --> 00:25.329
our primate ancestors
evolved into humans.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.897
Evolutionary biologists
suggest that dance

00:28.028 --> 00:29.246
was used by early humans

00:29.377 --> 00:30.900
to promote
the social cooperation

00:31.031 --> 00:32.945
essential for our survival.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.512
Indeed,
studies have found that

00:34.643 --> 00:36.340
today's best dancers all share

00:36.471 --> 00:38.386
the two specific genes
associated

00:38.516 --> 00:40.475
with excellent
interpersonal skills.

00:40.605 --> 00:43.521
But despite its power
to save our species,

00:43.652 --> 00:45.045
dance could not save

00:45.175 --> 00:46.916
a small furniture company
in Miami

00:47.047 --> 00:51.007
from the economic tsunami
of a global pandemic,

00:51.138 --> 00:54.837
so like many 40-year-old
Millennial white males,

00:54.967 --> 00:56.621
Mike Lane found himself

00:56.752 --> 01:00.147
alone and adrift in an ocean
of failed relationships

01:00.277 --> 01:01.931
and unrealized dreams.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.759
Excuse me?
Hello!

01:05.195 --> 01:06.675
This area is off-limits.

01:07.415 --> 01:09.156
Oh. Well, then

01:09.286 --> 01:11.071
you really shouldn't
be here then, should you?

01:12.072 --> 01:13.725
Cute.

01:13.856 --> 01:16.859
Get dressed, start unloading.
Trucks just pulled in.

01:16.989 --> 01:18.078
All right.

01:20.036 --> 01:23.648
So, is she
living in Miami now, or...

01:23.779 --> 01:25.476
Well,
she can't go back to London,

01:25.607 --> 01:27.087
Roger's there.

01:27.217 --> 01:28.914
She has to
go back, for the daughter.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.742
Roger still wants it to work,

01:30.873 --> 01:32.266
according to Bob.

01:32.396 --> 01:33.658
She should have just canceled

01:33.789 --> 01:35.051
instead of walking around
like a zombie.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.531
Totally.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.359
-And here she is.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.012
Hi.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.971
Thank you so much.
This is absolutely beautiful.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.930
-Oh, thank you
for your contribution.
-You look stunning.

01:53.678 --> 01:55.724
-Scotch, please.
-Neat or rocks?

01:55.854 --> 01:56.986
Neat.

01:59.380 --> 02:00.729
You getting what you want?

02:03.035 --> 02:06.561
With the fundraiser. It looks
like it's going all right.

02:06.691 --> 02:09.433
Nobody here knows what the
Big Blue Rescue Project is

02:09.564 --> 02:11.522
and yet they give me
their money every year.

02:12.828 --> 02:13.959
Well, I just think
people like to

02:14.090 --> 02:15.309
look at what they can't have.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.232
I guess.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.064
What's up, bro?
Two vodka sodas.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.718
Two vodka sodas.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.851
-So, what do you think? Yeah?
-Yeah. Sounds good.

02:37.635 --> 02:40.116
Wait. I know you.
You went to State, right?

02:40.247 --> 02:42.162
State?
No, definitely not.

02:42.292 --> 02:44.729
Huh. We've definitely met.

02:45.817 --> 02:48.211
Uh, no. I don't know. Sorry.

02:48.342 --> 02:53.825
-Don't freak the guy out, hon.
-I'm not.

02:53.956 --> 02:57.089
Holy shit. I got it.
You really don't remember?

02:58.917 --> 03:00.571
I don't know.
Was it at my store? Huh?

03:00.702 --> 03:03.748
No. You were a cop, right?

03:08.057 --> 03:09.624
-What's your name?
-Kim.

03:14.455 --> 03:16.631
Uh, yeah. Like way
back in the day. Yeah.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.067
Yeah. Yeah.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.416
Right, right, right.
Got it.

03:19.547 --> 03:21.636
Nice pull, hon!
Did you arrest her?

03:21.766 --> 03:24.291
Uh, no, I think I let you off
with a warning. Right?

03:24.421 --> 03:26.162
Mm-hmm.
It was my pledge party.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.251
I was being very disorderly.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.384
You being good now?
You behaving?

03:30.514 --> 03:32.081
-Yes, I'm great, actually.
-Good.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.867
I'm on Maxandra's legal team
so... here to support.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.956
That's cool. What kind of law
do you practice?

03:38.087 --> 03:41.743
Family Law generally. But,
I do specialize in divorce.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.962
-Well, it was good to see you.
-See you in another 10 years.

03:44.093 --> 03:48.010
-Cheers. Be good.
-I'll do my best.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.980
You!
Bartender.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.505
Mrs. Rattigan
would like a word.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.333
Uh, we're not done
breaking down.

04:06.463 --> 04:07.638
Did you hear what I said?

04:07.769 --> 04:09.336
She'd like
to see you right now.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.816
Bullshit. Hey, look,

04:11.947 --> 04:14.079
you don't have to explain it
to me. All right?

04:14.210 --> 04:16.517
Explain it to Zadie.

04:16.647 --> 04:17.866
Ma'am?

04:17.996 --> 04:20.303
Of course,
I'm super uncomfortable

04:20.434 --> 04:22.653
doing that and I won't do it.

04:22.784 --> 04:26.048
Because that's a date
with chaperones.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.528
I'm not stupid, Roger.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.399
Ma'am, uh,
they said to come see you.

04:29.530 --> 04:30.705
Should I just wait outside?

04:30.835 --> 04:32.533
I don't want to see you!
All right?

04:32.663 --> 04:35.057
Get it into your head,
if you need to talk to me

04:35.187 --> 04:36.667
then bring the lawyers.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.235
Um, bartender?

04:39.366 --> 04:40.671
I'm sorry. They said to come
see you. I didn't mean to--

04:40.802 --> 04:42.238
Yes, yes, please come back.

04:42.891 --> 04:43.892
Okay.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.636
-Yeah?

04:54.032 --> 05:00.256
You know...
Do you like bartending?

05:00.387 --> 05:03.215
Sure. Uh, it's not
really what I do,

05:03.346 --> 05:04.565
but yeah. Why not?

05:04.695 --> 05:06.828
So, what is it
that you really do?

05:06.958 --> 05:09.439
Uh, yeah-- Well,
it's-- That's a long story.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.267
Did you want me for something?

05:11.398 --> 05:13.225
Yeah...

05:16.577 --> 05:18.840
Um, what's your name?

05:18.970 --> 05:20.145
Mike.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.018
Nice to meet you, Mike.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.324
Nice to meet you.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.459
How much?

05:31.722 --> 05:33.550
How much for what?

05:37.467 --> 05:38.773
You know. Please don't make me

05:38.903 --> 05:40.122
spit it out

05:40.165 --> 05:41.166
because this is the first time
I do this

05:41.297 --> 05:44.082
and it's not comfortable.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.345
Look, I don't know

05:45.475 --> 05:46.302
what you're talking about.
What?

05:49.740 --> 05:53.353
But Kim told me that she
knew you, and run into you,

05:53.483 --> 05:54.745
and that you were a dancer.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.313
-Oh, Kim-- Kim told you that?
-Yeah.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.750
-Right.

05:59.881 --> 06:04.059
Uh, look, I don't really
do that anymore, so--

06:04.189 --> 06:05.234
Uh, what was your name?

06:05.365 --> 06:06.714
Max.

06:06.844 --> 06:09.369
Max, it was nice to meet you.
Uh, thanks for--

06:09.499 --> 06:12.154
I'm s-- I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.547
No, you didn't offend me.
Don't worry. It's all--

06:13.677 --> 06:15.244
Really, I have no idea
what I'm doing.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.941
It's just I'm not
normally like this...

06:17.072 --> 06:18.726
it's just that I've had
like the shittiest day

06:18.856 --> 06:20.292
and the shittiest week...

06:20.423 --> 06:21.511
and the shittiest month,
and the shittiest year.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.121
Same here.
Welcome to the club.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.080
Don't worry,
you didn't offend me.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.168
Okay.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.172
It was nice
to meet you.

06:30.302 --> 06:32.783
So, let's say...

06:32.914 --> 06:37.266
if you were to do this just,
like, one last time.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.572
Mm-hmm?

06:38.702 --> 06:40.791
How much would something
like that go for?

06:40.922 --> 06:42.053
How much would something

06:42.184 --> 06:44.491
like that go for?

06:44.621 --> 06:47.624
Uh, $60,000? Maybe.

06:47.755 --> 06:50.497
-$60,000?
-Yeah. Yeah, 60.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.194
Let's call it 60.

06:52.324 --> 06:55.066
What the fuck do you do?
She said it was a silly dance.

06:55.197 --> 06:58.200
Who said that? Kim?
Kim said that? It was silly?

06:58.330 --> 07:00.637
Yeah. She said
it was a silly dance,

07:00.768 --> 07:03.118
but that it would
get my mind off of things.

07:03.248 --> 07:06.991
And if she's right,
I'm willing to pay six.

07:09.254 --> 07:10.995
What?
You're serious right now?

07:11.126 --> 07:12.954
You're gonna pay me $6,000
to give you a dance?

07:15.043 --> 07:17.175
Yeah, but no happy endings,
huh?

07:18.742 --> 07:20.135
So we have a deal?

07:29.536 --> 07:31.407
Are you leaving?

07:32.843 --> 07:34.932
You know I have security.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.020
Mm-hmm.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.459
What are you doing?

07:39.589 --> 07:42.897
Um, you seem like
you need a drink.

07:44.551 --> 07:47.205
I really, really do.

08:02.307 --> 08:04.614
Why are you moving my flowers?

08:04.745 --> 08:07.008
These will work better here.

08:08.705 --> 08:09.880
You have a really, really,

08:10.011 --> 08:11.403
really nice house.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.494
Thank you.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.017
Everything's made really well.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.462
Are you redecorating?

08:28.333 --> 08:29.770
Maybe. Do you have music?

08:32.947 --> 08:34.731
You might want to
finish your drink.

08:48.092 --> 08:51.618
So, I don't know if you
really know what you bought...

08:51.748 --> 08:55.970
but I'm gonna give it
to you anyway.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.668
And at any point I take you
past your comfort zone--

08:58.799 --> 09:00.540
I fucking slap you.

09:00.670 --> 09:03.804
You can slap me.
That's perfect.

09:05.327 --> 09:06.328
May I touch you?

09:08.548 --> 09:09.549
I guess.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.429
Thanks.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.388
You don't know what I said.

13:44.519 --> 13:45.955
What are you talking about?
Yeah, I do.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.740
What did I say?

13:48.871 --> 13:50.612
You said I move like water.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.836
I didn't mean for you to
understand that.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.360
Well, maybe you should be

13:59.490 --> 14:00.927
a little more careful
what you say.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.190
Remember, I am from Florida.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.894
If I had known what this night
was going to be like...

14:13.504 --> 14:16.594
I would have gladly paid you
the 60 thousand.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.641
It wouldn't have
mattered anyway,

14:19.771 --> 14:21.251
I'm not gonna take your money.

14:21.382 --> 14:24.298
I'm not even gonna take
the six grand.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.220
Who are you?

14:35.787 --> 14:38.834
Um, I don't know.

14:40.401 --> 14:41.445
What do you mean?

14:45.275 --> 14:46.624
Come with me to London.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.063
What's in London?

14:50.193 --> 14:52.456
My life.

14:52.587 --> 14:55.633
Your life's in London?
I thought this was your house.

14:55.764 --> 14:59.028
This is a house,
but it's not  the house.

15:01.248 --> 15:03.859
Max, I can't just
go to London.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.730
I got, like,
stuff here. I got--

15:05.861 --> 15:07.819
Like there's a whole mess.
I got a job.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.734
I can't just go to London.

15:09.865 --> 15:12.520
I'm gonna get you
a much better job in London.

15:12.650 --> 15:13.869
You're gonna get--

15:14.000 --> 15:16.045
No, well, I have a job
for you in mind.

15:16.176 --> 15:19.919
It's creative.
And all you have to do

15:20.049 --> 15:21.355
is come with me for a month

15:21.485 --> 15:24.967
and I will give you
your 60 thousand.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.884
Max, I can't just up and leave
my entire life here for you--

15:29.015 --> 15:30.364
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
Listen. Listen.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.192
Not for a mon-- I can't.
Not for a whole month.

15:32.322 --> 15:33.976
You should come with me

15:34.107 --> 15:36.370
and then if it's out of your
comfort zone then you just--

15:36.500 --> 15:38.720
-I get to fucking slap you?
-You can fucking slap me.

15:41.114 --> 15:42.115
Let's go.

15:47.033 --> 15:47.990
Thank you.

15:55.215 --> 15:56.694
What are you doing?

15:56.825 --> 15:58.958
I don't really
fuck with vegetables.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.700
How do you
have that body then?

16:02.831 --> 16:06.095
I don't know. Genetics.
Mom and Pops.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.271
How'd you get so rich?

16:09.577 --> 16:12.972
-Genetics, I guess.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah?

16:13.102 --> 16:15.713
No, Roger's family
is in media.

16:15.844 --> 16:18.673
Oh, that's cool.
Is that like TV and shit?

16:18.803 --> 16:21.328
It's more like
everything and shit.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.156
Right.

16:23.286 --> 16:26.855
So, um, I don't know.
What happened, with that?

16:28.900 --> 16:30.380
Marriage happened.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.339
Mmm.

16:32.469 --> 16:34.167
Are you married?

16:34.297 --> 16:38.780
Am I married? Um, would it
be a problem if I was?

16:38.910 --> 16:42.914
No. This is
100 percent business.

16:43.045 --> 16:46.135
Right. You keep talking
about this "job."

16:46.266 --> 16:48.485
But you always leave out
what the actual job is.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.227
It's what you were meant
to be doing all along.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.057
Okay. I've made it
really clear though,

16:55.188 --> 16:57.146
I'm not--
I don't dance anymore.

16:57.277 --> 17:00.889
Then I can claim that I got
Magic Mike's Last Dance.

17:03.674 --> 17:06.025
So what else could you
possibly be paying me for?

17:08.549 --> 17:10.377
We are not having sex.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.161
Completely
out of the question.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.121
Why?

17:15.251 --> 17:17.079
You know, Mike,
I actually think you have...

17:18.994 --> 17:21.649
other talents. And this is
what I'm invested in.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.912
Okay. But just, you know,
hear me out.

17:26.306 --> 17:30.527
You've purchased me for
a month, um, let's just say...

17:30.658 --> 17:33.008
you say, "Jump."
I say, "Which bed?"

17:33.139 --> 17:35.141
Look, last night was...

17:36.577 --> 17:40.624
kind of magical.
It was amazing.

17:40.755 --> 17:44.280
So, let's not fuck that up.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.066
Okay?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.242
Okay.

17:49.372 --> 17:52.071
Uh, and no.
I'm not, by the way.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.203
What?

17:54.334 --> 17:55.509
Married.

17:59.208 --> 18:03.299
Okay. Are you
in a relationship?

18:03.430 --> 18:05.084
Mm-mm. No.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.476
Me and relationships

18:06.607 --> 18:08.478
don't have a tendency
to, uh, work out.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.440
Yeah, I can understand that.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.529
-To freedom.
-To freedom.

19:01.444 --> 19:05.187
Now, sir, the brown hamper
is for dry cleaning

19:05.318 --> 19:07.885
and the beige hamper
is for regular laundry.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.540
Uh, I'm probably
not gonna have

19:10.671 --> 19:11.889
any dry cleaning and I,
by the way

19:12.020 --> 19:13.239
I can do my own clothes, man.

19:13.369 --> 19:14.631
Just show me
where the machines are.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.807
Ms. Mendoza would
never allow that, sir.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.635
Aw, man, you can call me Mike.
It's all good.

19:18.766 --> 19:21.421
As you wish, sir. The loo
is through this door here.

19:22.291 --> 19:25.164
Uh, the toilet, sir.

19:25.294 --> 19:26.469
Right.
Do you have any idea

19:26.600 --> 19:28.079
what the fuck I'm doing here?

19:28.210 --> 19:30.691
Uh, regrettably... no, sir.

19:30.821 --> 19:31.996
Yeah, but you wouldn't tell me

19:32.127 --> 19:33.476
even if you did know,
would you?

19:33.607 --> 19:36.131
I would be lying
if I said I wasn't lying, sir.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.306
Right.
It's Mike, man.

19:37.437 --> 19:38.960
Just call me Mike.

19:39.090 --> 19:42.355
Well, "Mike," Ms. Mendoza
does love a good surprise.

19:42.485 --> 19:45.314
I'll collect you at half past.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.882
Collect me at half past
for the surprise. Cool.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.064
Shit.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.288
I never like
to give credit to Victor

20:02.418 --> 20:04.986
because he becomes
unbearable...

20:05.116 --> 20:07.510
but I wouldn't own the place
that we're going to

20:07.641 --> 20:09.077
if he hadn't convinced me

20:09.208 --> 20:11.035
to fight for it
in the settlement.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.341
Her only other option

20:12.472 --> 20:15.518
was a sand and gravel pit
in High Wycombe.

20:15.649 --> 20:20.393
And the only value I saw in it
was that my mother-in-law...

20:20.523 --> 20:22.003
didn't want to give it away.

20:22.133 --> 20:25.354
But now,
I have found its purpose.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.229
What's my purpose there?
If we're going there.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.232
Well...

20:33.362 --> 20:35.234
just pretend
that today is Christmas

20:35.364 --> 20:37.758
and you're about to open
your presents.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.238
Okay.

20:39.368 --> 20:42.066
As a matter of fact, Victor,

20:42.197 --> 20:43.938
I think we should stop
at Liberty's first.

20:44.068 --> 20:45.069
Don't you think?

20:45.200 --> 20:46.854
I would let Harj know,

20:46.984 --> 20:48.377
so that he can
mentally prepare.

20:48.508 --> 20:49.857
Good idea.

20:50.771 --> 20:52.076
What's a Harj?

21:02.261 --> 21:03.697
Hello, Harj.

21:03.827 --> 21:06.874
Good afternoon,
Madame Rattigan!

21:07.004 --> 21:09.485
Don't you "madame" me
and it's Mendoza now.

21:11.444 --> 21:14.795
So where's
"the big tear-down"?

21:14.925 --> 21:17.406
What--
This does not cost that.

21:17.537 --> 21:18.973
What is this in dollars?

21:19.103 --> 21:20.409
Do you like--
What, do you drop a zero or...

21:21.541 --> 21:22.672
So cute.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.551
Do you know what Victor does?

21:31.681 --> 21:33.204
So you own this place?

21:33.335 --> 21:34.989
I do now.

21:35.119 --> 21:38.079
When this very same play
opened in 2004,

21:38.209 --> 21:39.994
the owner of the theater

21:40.124 --> 21:43.302
fell madly in love with this
horribly insecure actress.

21:43.432 --> 21:45.478
And so...

21:45.608 --> 21:48.132
here's where my love story
with Roger began

21:48.263 --> 21:50.178
and here is where
it's going to end.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.094
He must have loved
your performance.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.879
I had three lines.

22:02.103 --> 22:05.106
Well, you certainly
look the part.

22:05.236 --> 22:08.196
So relax, have fun

22:08.327 --> 22:10.851
and I promise there won't be
any more surprises,

22:10.981 --> 22:12.069
but you're gonna like
this one.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.157
You swear?

22:14.507 --> 22:15.812
Deal.

22:15.943 --> 22:18.032
Miss Mendoza!
Right on time as usual.

22:18.162 --> 22:19.860
Stop it, Woody.
I'm half an hour late.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.644
As usual. Is this, uh--

22:21.775 --> 22:23.211
Yeah, Mike, meet Woody,

22:23.342 --> 22:25.082
the best stage manager
in all of London.

22:25.213 --> 22:27.694
Easy. I'm just here to serve
your vision, gov.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.566
My vision?

22:30.697 --> 22:34.396
Mm-hmm. Your vision. Let's go.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.312
Oh, fuck.

22:38.705 --> 22:39.793
Voilà.

22:40.533 --> 22:41.577
Wow.

22:41.708 --> 22:42.883
Right on time.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.195
Listen, I-- Hugh,

22:51.326 --> 22:54.373
are we actually going again
because I'm not sure.

22:54.503 --> 22:55.765
But if you go back
to the start of the scene

22:55.896 --> 22:57.071
please just go
to the top of the scene

22:57.201 --> 22:58.377
and imbue it
with a little more--

22:58.507 --> 22:59.508
So what's this
shit about?

22:59.639 --> 23:01.031
It's the same old

23:01.162 --> 23:03.164
will-she-marry-for-love
or-money bullshit.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.079
Hmm.

23:05.209 --> 23:07.081
So, what does she pick?
Love or money?

23:07.211 --> 23:08.691
Who cares?

23:08.822 --> 23:10.693
The real question is:

23:10.824 --> 23:12.521
why does she feel like
she has to choose?

23:12.652 --> 23:14.001
I think
I've run out of words.

23:14.131 --> 23:15.394
Hell yeah.

23:15.524 --> 23:16.786
Well, this is your joint,
right?

23:16.917 --> 23:18.179
Why don't you just
give them that note?

23:18.309 --> 23:19.267
Show me,

23:19.398 --> 23:20.703
have you got the script or--

23:20.834 --> 23:21.704
Jessica,
do you have a script?

23:24.403 --> 23:25.621
Oh, this is a jolly good

23:25.752 --> 23:26.840
waste of time, isn't it?

23:26.970 --> 23:28.798
Bravo!
Bravo, everybody.

23:28.929 --> 23:31.322
Absolutely flawless,
thank you.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.976
Excuse me?
Who the fuck is talking?

23:33.107 --> 23:36.153
Oh. Maxandra.
My sincere apologies.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.155
I couldn't see you
in the light.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.157
Nice to see you again, uh...

23:41.245 --> 23:43.204
-Matthew.
-Right.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.641
-The director.
-Of course.

23:45.772 --> 23:47.382
To what
do we owe the pleasure?

23:47.513 --> 23:48.905
I'm here to make
an announcement.

23:49.036 --> 23:51.604
Oh! Oh. Tell me.

23:51.734 --> 23:53.083
Well, if I only told you

23:53.214 --> 23:55.303
it wouldn't be
an announcement, would it?

23:55.434 --> 23:58.349
I suppose not.
Um, attention, everyone!

23:58.480 --> 24:00.613
Gang,
this is Maxandra Rattigan.

24:00.743 --> 24:02.136
The wife of our owner and--

24:02.266 --> 24:05.444
Actually,
it's Maxandra Mendoza

24:05.574 --> 24:07.924
and I'm the legal owner
of this theater.

24:10.492 --> 24:13.321
I am here
to give you all notice

24:13.452 --> 24:15.802
Isabel Ascendant is closed...

24:17.020 --> 24:18.326
effective immediately.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.545
On what fucking grounds?

24:19.675 --> 24:21.198
We are at capacity
every night!

24:21.329 --> 24:25.638
Relax. It's only a four-week
course correction.

24:25.768 --> 24:30.120
An evolution. A revelation!

24:31.774 --> 24:34.168
And no one is fired.

24:34.298 --> 24:35.561
Christ.

24:35.691 --> 24:37.476
Except for, um...

24:39.347 --> 24:41.784
-Matthew.
-Matthew. Yes.

24:41.915 --> 24:44.221
Matthew will be replaced

24:44.352 --> 24:46.920
by a brilliant
new choreographer

24:47.050 --> 24:50.184
that I recently
discovered in Miami.

24:50.314 --> 24:53.274
His artistry
made me feel, uh...

24:56.364 --> 24:59.193
There are
no words. It's just...

25:00.063 --> 25:01.064
ecstasy.

25:01.978 --> 25:04.111
And in exactly one month,

25:04.241 --> 25:08.463
I want every woman that
walks into this theater

25:08.594 --> 25:11.814
to feel the same kind
of ecstasy that I did.

25:11.945 --> 25:16.471
To transcend. To break free.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.342
So, without further ado...

25:18.473 --> 25:22.259
I give you
the visionary artist...

25:22.390 --> 25:26.133
that inspired me
so profoundly

25:26.263 --> 25:29.049
and that will take us
to the promised land.

25:29.179 --> 25:31.225
Ladies and gentlemen...

25:31.355 --> 25:33.706
Michael Jeffrey Lane.

25:43.063 --> 25:44.586
'Sup?

25:44.717 --> 25:48.503
The look on Roger's face
when he sees this!

25:48.634 --> 25:51.419
It's worth every pound,
every shilling.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.638
No. Yeah.
You could've given me

25:52.768 --> 25:54.291
just a little
heads-up before

25:54.422 --> 25:55.728
you threw me
to the wolves in there!

25:55.858 --> 25:57.120
You would've been
in your head,

25:57.251 --> 25:58.469
over-thinking everything.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.688
It was better
than not thinking

25:59.819 --> 26:00.907
anything at all. Like--

26:01.037 --> 26:02.648
And what are you
so excited about?

26:02.778 --> 26:04.127
Like every single person
in there quit!

26:04.258 --> 26:07.130
We don't need actors,
we need dancers.

26:07.261 --> 26:09.176
Plus, by not firing them,

26:09.306 --> 26:11.613
we saved thousands
on labor-union fees.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.876
-More money for you.

26:14.007 --> 26:17.488
Yeah, but-- Okay. I--
Look, no offense...

26:17.619 --> 26:18.925
but there's got to be
easier ways

26:19.055 --> 26:20.666
to get back
at your husband for...

26:20.796 --> 26:23.016
I don't know, whatever,
than putting on a strip show.

26:23.146 --> 26:26.802
Oh, I'm not a scorned woman,
and this is not a strip show.

26:26.933 --> 26:29.239
We are bringing
the tsunami to London!

26:29.370 --> 26:31.198
Okay.
All right. This--

26:31.328 --> 26:32.416
And I'm down for that.

26:32.547 --> 26:33.592
I just think that
you haven't--

26:33.722 --> 26:35.202
Can't you see?
People are numb,

26:35.332 --> 26:37.552
disconnected, desensitized.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.641
We're going to wake them up

26:39.772 --> 26:43.036
with a wave of passion
they've never felt before.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.778
Okay, I just--
There's one little thing

26:45.908 --> 26:47.344
that I think you're forgetting

26:47.475 --> 26:49.608
is that I don't know shit
about directing theater.

26:49.738 --> 26:51.435
-And that's why you have me!
-What?

26:51.566 --> 26:53.176
It will be a historical,

26:53.307 --> 26:56.702
one-night collaboration
between the stage, and the...

26:56.832 --> 26:58.660
-The thongs?
-Eh, I don't know.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.749
-Exactly. That's what--
-Who the hell are you?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.185
I don't know. Who are you?

27:02.316 --> 27:04.623
Zadie,
what are you doing here?

27:04.753 --> 27:06.537
Um, this is my daughter,
Zadie.

27:06.668 --> 27:09.497
Oh, shit. Hi.
Nice to meet you!

27:09.628 --> 27:11.978
-We had a meeting, Maxandra.
-Yeah.

27:12.108 --> 27:14.633
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

27:14.763 --> 27:16.765
I completely
lost track of time.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.811
Completely. I'm so sorry.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.334
I can see that.
I'm more interested

27:20.464 --> 27:22.815
in why you lost track of time.

27:22.945 --> 27:25.992
Well, um, I've been
handling some business

27:26.122 --> 27:28.037
with the new director
of  Isabel Ascendant.

27:28.168 --> 27:29.604
-Mm-hmm.
-Michael Jeffrey Lane.

27:29.735 --> 27:32.433
Ah, yeah. That's not my name.
But-- It's just--

27:32.563 --> 27:33.652
But it's got gravitas.

27:33.782 --> 27:35.218
Yeah, it's just--
It's Mike Lane.

27:35.349 --> 27:36.437
But you do need a stage name.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.744
-Are you two hooking up?
-Zadie!

27:38.874 --> 27:40.354
Well, I-- What's funny
about that is, uh...

27:40.484 --> 27:42.530
your mom actually
is paying me to not hook up.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.359
We are not hooking up.

27:45.489 --> 27:48.057
But he will be
staying at the house

27:48.188 --> 27:50.146
just until he gets settled.
Okay?

27:50.277 --> 27:51.844
How convenient.

27:51.974 --> 27:53.802
Tell me, Mike, what do you
plan to do with Act Three?

27:53.933 --> 27:56.762
Yeah, we're gonna have one.

27:56.892 --> 28:00.766
I was pl-- I was, uh, planning
on doing Act Three like a--

28:00.896 --> 28:02.289
Everybody knows

28:02.419 --> 28:04.030
Isabel Ascendant
has a wildly outdated,

28:04.160 --> 28:05.118
painfully misogynistic climax.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.336
Mm-hmm.

28:06.467 --> 28:08.512
Exactly.
And that's why our take

28:08.643 --> 28:10.340
is going to be so exciting

28:10.471 --> 28:11.864
because they will be
expecting that

28:11.994 --> 28:13.692
and instead,
they're gonna see

28:13.822 --> 28:14.910
that a woman can have
whatever she wants,

28:15.041 --> 28:16.869
-whenever she wants it.
-Mm-hmm.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.132
Since when do you
believe that?

28:19.262 --> 28:21.177
Since Mike and I have
been exploring this theme.

28:21.308 --> 28:25.965
Yeah, your m-- Yeah, we've
been exploring those themes.

28:26.095 --> 28:29.011
You're in another one
of your phases, aren't you?

28:29.142 --> 28:32.623
Baby, don't you have some
schoolwork to do?

28:32.754 --> 28:35.017
Uh, what's the phases thing?

28:35.148 --> 28:37.628
Every few years
she starts a big new project.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.935
Sometimes it's a charity,
a documentary,

28:40.066 --> 28:41.763
-a new best friend.
-Right.

28:41.894 --> 28:44.070
Each time it's like
she's a new person.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.462
So what?

28:45.593 --> 28:47.464
Sue me for exploring myself

28:47.595 --> 28:50.467
and my contributions
to the world!

28:50.598 --> 28:52.687
But your contributions
never see the light of day.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.428
There's always some obstacle.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.038
We call her
The Queen of the First Act.

28:56.169 --> 28:58.084
Our therapist,
whom she stood up to be here,

28:58.214 --> 28:59.781
says she tries on these new

28:59.912 --> 29:02.001
personas as a way from running
from the guilt about--

29:02.131 --> 29:03.611
I already said how sorry I am

29:03.742 --> 29:04.917
about missing
that appointment

29:05.047 --> 29:07.223
and I am going
to reschedule it.

29:28.027 --> 29:30.116
Uh, you know,
pardon my French,

29:30.246 --> 29:32.858
but, uh, y'all are being
rude as fuck.

29:32.988 --> 29:33.989
Sorry.

29:37.384 --> 29:40.387
-Pleasure, Zadie.
-Zadie, wait, don't go.

29:40.517 --> 29:43.129
You want some cake? Baby.

29:47.437 --> 29:48.438
What's going on?

29:51.920 --> 29:55.837
No, I didn't know
until you sent it.

29:55.968 --> 29:57.708
Well, technically,
she does have the right.

29:59.710 --> 30:02.713
I have no idea.
Maybe Zadie will tell me.

30:04.890 --> 30:06.456
Change the agreement how?

30:08.110 --> 30:09.895
Mother-- Mother, I think

30:10.025 --> 30:12.114
you should pursue this
on your own.

30:12.245 --> 30:13.899
I can't get dragged
into a fight.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.639
Not about this,
not right now.

30:16.336 --> 30:17.903
Yo!

30:18.033 --> 30:21.210
Holy shit! Naysayers,
we have proof of life!

30:21.341 --> 30:22.777
All right.

30:22.908 --> 30:25.519
What's up, man?
I know, look, I know. I-I--

30:25.649 --> 30:28.043
And I'm sorry, okay, I know
I've been ducking you all.

30:28.174 --> 30:29.958
Uh, I apologize. I just--

30:30.089 --> 30:32.178
It's a long story,
but I'm in London

30:32.308 --> 30:33.483
and I just want you guys
to know

30:33.614 --> 30:34.833
I'm gonna be able
to pay you back,

30:34.963 --> 30:36.443
I just need a few weeks. Okay?

30:36.573 --> 30:37.836
Oh, come on, man!

30:37.966 --> 30:39.533
How many times
do we have to tell you

30:39.663 --> 30:42.666
you don't need to pay us back!
It was an investment.

30:42.797 --> 30:44.016
I know. I know. But I'm--

30:44.146 --> 30:45.452
As many times
as you guys say that,

30:45.582 --> 30:46.627
I'm not just gonna burn
my friends' money

30:46.757 --> 30:48.281
and not care. All right?
I don't--

30:48.411 --> 30:51.980
No. Money is water, Mike.
It flows in both directions.

30:52.111 --> 30:53.939
That's a good point,
but still.

30:54.069 --> 30:57.594
You-- Yeah, hold up.
You buried the lede here.

30:57.725 --> 31:00.032
Why are you in London?

31:00.162 --> 31:03.339
I don't know, short story
is that...

31:03.470 --> 31:07.256
I was bartending at, uh,
this charity event

31:07.387 --> 31:08.736
and then
at the end of the night

31:08.867 --> 31:10.825
I ended up giving
this rich lady a lap dance

31:10.956 --> 31:12.566
and now I'm living
in her house in London

31:12.696 --> 31:14.046
and gonna put on a show

31:14.176 --> 31:16.483
at this famous theater
that she owns. So, yeah.

31:16.613 --> 31:18.702
Cool. Hey, sex work

31:18.833 --> 31:20.704
is nothing to be
embarrassed about, Mikey.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.924
Especially when
it's the live-in kind.

31:23.055 --> 31:25.405
Hey, look, thanks, Tarzan.

31:25.535 --> 31:26.667
Look, I basically
am just saying

31:26.797 --> 31:27.929
though I'm gonna
have your money...

31:28.060 --> 31:29.975
I don't exactly know, uh,

31:30.105 --> 31:32.542
what I said yes to
so I hope it works out.

31:32.673 --> 31:35.197
Mikey, Mikey,
this is great news.

31:35.328 --> 31:37.330
I was looking
at your chart last night...

31:37.460 --> 31:38.592
you know you're in a once-

31:38.722 --> 31:41.769
in-33-year Jupiter cycle,
right?

31:41.900 --> 31:45.947
I-- No, I didn't, but that
explains a lot I guess. Yeah.

31:46.078 --> 31:48.907
Yeah, it does, so whatever
existential confusion

31:49.037 --> 31:50.038
you're feeling right now,

31:50.169 --> 31:51.822
it's an initiation.

31:51.953 --> 31:55.087
It's wiping the slate clean
for you to self-actualize.

31:55.217 --> 31:58.742
Uh, I'm just trying
to survive to be honest.

31:58.873 --> 32:01.397
Surviving?
Bro, you are a gig worker.

32:01.528 --> 32:03.747
Magic Mike's coming back
to the main stage.

32:03.878 --> 32:05.575
I-- But that's the thing
I'm not even dancing though.

32:05.706 --> 32:06.925
I'm putting on the show.

32:07.055 --> 32:08.927
I guess I'm directing
or whatever.

32:09.057 --> 32:10.929
I mean, it's--
I'm only here for a month,

32:11.059 --> 32:12.582
it's for one show only,

32:12.713 --> 32:15.237
to basically get back
at her ex or something.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.631
I don't know. It's totally
bonkers over here.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.850
Who gives a shit, man?
She's rich.

32:19.981 --> 32:24.377
Trust me. Do not leave
that situation. Okay?

32:24.507 --> 32:26.553
Look at me,
I'm basically a freaking

32:26.683 --> 32:28.555
glorified dog walker. Okay?

32:28.685 --> 32:31.253
You just need to make sure
she doesn't wake up,

32:31.384 --> 32:32.689
and all of a sudden

32:32.820 --> 32:34.300
want you out of the house,

32:34.430 --> 32:37.912
which I have tips on
by the way if you want them.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.436
Okay. I-I--
We don't have dogs here

32:40.567 --> 32:42.047
so maybe that's a good idea.

32:42.177 --> 32:45.746
I feel it. I feel it
in my solar plexus, brother.

32:45.876 --> 32:48.009
This is your dharma.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.403
-Just stay in the flow.
-Victor?

32:50.533 --> 32:52.013
What are you doing there?

32:52.144 --> 32:54.668
Oh, you know, waiting
for passing fucking trade.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.975
He's on a private call.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.151
Since when has that
stopped you?

32:59.281 --> 33:00.891
Oh, boys, I miss you.

33:02.284 --> 33:03.938
-Are you decent?
-Yep.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.070
Is that her?

33:05.200 --> 33:06.636
Are we interrupting something?

33:06.767 --> 33:09.596
No, I was just, uh,
looking for some ideas.

33:09.726 --> 33:12.729
Oh, I've been
"scouting" myself.

33:12.860 --> 33:15.341
And come take a look at
what I found.

33:18.083 --> 33:18.997
Look at that.

33:26.439 --> 33:28.049
Isn't he magnificent?

33:28.180 --> 33:29.137
Hmm.

33:31.313 --> 33:34.403
He has such an innate
elegance and intelligence

33:34.534 --> 33:36.275
to the way he moves.

33:36.405 --> 33:37.711
And then at the same time

33:37.841 --> 33:40.496
there's this savage thing,
you know...

33:40.627 --> 33:43.499
like a primal animal.

33:43.630 --> 33:47.025
Just incredible.

33:47.155 --> 33:49.201
I think this is what we need
for the show.

33:49.331 --> 33:51.551
Trained dancers,
not strippers.

33:52.856 --> 33:55.555
Yeah, but, I mean,
as the director,

33:55.685 --> 33:57.992
I-I-I promise you...

33:58.123 --> 33:59.994
I know exactly what
we're looking for. Yeah.

34:02.866 --> 34:04.868
I love the way
you just did that.

34:04.999 --> 34:05.956
What?

34:06.087 --> 34:07.306
"As the director."

34:08.959 --> 34:12.006
You're really owning
that place. You know?

34:12.137 --> 34:14.356
It comes to you so naturally.

34:14.487 --> 34:15.879
Mm-hmm.

34:16.010 --> 34:18.795
I can tell that you already
have a vision.

34:18.926 --> 34:22.669
And I'm sure that you agree
that this would be fantastic.

34:22.799 --> 34:24.801
-Yeah, he's great.
-For the show, I mean.

34:24.932 --> 34:26.107
Yeah. Yeah, really.
I mean, he's--

34:26.238 --> 34:28.544
Antonio is what we need.

34:28.675 --> 34:30.242
Uh, he's great. Like I said,

34:30.372 --> 34:32.940
he's just--
But he's also in Italy.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.290
-Roma.
-Roma, see, I can't--

34:35.421 --> 34:37.336
I don't have time
to go find him in Roma

34:37.466 --> 34:38.859
and then bring him
all the way back here.

34:38.989 --> 34:40.817
Oh, no. That would be
out of the question.

34:40.948 --> 34:43.385
But that's why you have
a genius producer!

34:45.039 --> 34:46.736
He's arriving on Thursday.

34:46.867 --> 34:49.609
If you approve.
Creatively, I mean.

34:52.829 --> 34:57.051
Yeah, look, if you want him,
um, sure. I-I-I approve.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.096
Creatively, of course.

34:58.226 --> 34:59.749
I'm so excited!

35:01.142 --> 35:02.361
Are you excited?

35:02.491 --> 35:05.015
Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I am.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.453
You don't sound excited.

35:07.583 --> 35:09.411
I'm very, very, very excited.
I promise.

35:09.542 --> 35:10.847
Oh, man, me,
I don't even think

35:10.978 --> 35:12.501
I am gonna be able to sleep.

35:13.154 --> 35:14.112
No?

35:21.206 --> 35:22.250
Good night.

35:25.253 --> 35:26.559
Sweet dreams.

35:26.689 --> 35:27.647
Okay.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.694
Wait, wait,
where are you going? Hey.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.870
To bed?

35:34.001 --> 35:35.916
We got like 10
other dancers to find.

35:36.046 --> 35:39.528
And that's why we have Renata.
Good night.

35:47.710 --> 35:48.972
Per your instructions

35:49.103 --> 35:52.280
I've assembled
the top-tier of talent

35:52.411 --> 35:54.978
across multiple
movement disciplines.

35:55.109 --> 35:58.765
And they're all
very eager to please...

35:58.895 --> 36:02.595
and quite athletic,
as you requested.

36:02.725 --> 36:05.554
Excellent work
as usual, Renata.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.228
She couldn't explain

39:21.359 --> 39:22.795
the full extent
of her feelings...

39:22.925 --> 39:24.231
but Max knew
that she had crossed

39:24.362 --> 39:26.276
some kind of strange Rubicon.

39:26.407 --> 39:27.626
She was desperate to know

39:27.756 --> 39:29.454
more about
why she felt this way,

39:29.584 --> 39:33.719
so she purchased a litany of
books on the history of dance.

39:33.849 --> 39:37.070
For Mike, The Rattigan
had no symbolic weight,

39:37.200 --> 39:40.029
it was simply
where he had to work.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.988
And he reminded himself,

39:42.118 --> 39:45.339
in order to finish something,
you have to make a start.

39:45.470 --> 39:48.951
For Maxandra, The Rattigan
had been transformed.

39:49.082 --> 39:51.954
It went from existing
only in the past

39:52.085 --> 39:54.043
to being a source of renewal.

39:54.174 --> 39:56.481
-Hello, hello, hello.
-Hey! Hey!

39:56.611 --> 39:59.484
Are you ready to transform
theater forever?

40:00.746 --> 40:01.834
-Whoo!
-Yeah.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.447
All right.
Calm down, calm down.

40:06.578 --> 40:08.101
We ain't done shit yet.

40:08.231 --> 40:10.625
All right, you guys have
all the talent in the world.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.105
Ain't no questioning that.

40:12.235 --> 40:13.628
Each and every
single person here

40:13.759 --> 40:15.021
was hand selected
because they bring

40:15.151 --> 40:16.326
something unique to the table

40:16.457 --> 40:17.415
that we ain't
never seen before.

40:18.198 --> 40:19.591
All right?

40:19.721 --> 40:21.419
But I have a question for you.

40:21.549 --> 40:22.898
Who here, by show of hands

40:23.029 --> 40:24.422
has stood in front
of a thousand women

40:24.552 --> 40:25.597
and had to get butt-ass naked?

40:30.079 --> 40:31.733
Exactly.

40:31.864 --> 40:33.256
You want to find out how fast

40:33.387 --> 40:35.520
a group of sweet,
nurturing moms can make you

40:35.650 --> 40:37.435
just go running, cowering

40:37.565 --> 40:39.480
into a dark corner,
wishing you were never born?

40:39.611 --> 40:41.134
I promise you it can happen.

40:41.264 --> 40:42.527
I've seen it.
And it can happen

40:42.657 --> 40:43.963
just like that.

40:45.747 --> 40:48.010
Now I can't believe I'm about
to say these words out loud,

40:48.141 --> 40:49.316
but we got one month.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.709
Oh, yeah.

40:50.839 --> 40:52.754
We got one month to turn y'all

40:52.885 --> 40:54.234
into the greatest
group of strippers

40:54.364 --> 40:57.193
that has ever been assembled
on planet Earth.

40:57.324 --> 40:58.717
And to do that,

40:58.847 --> 41:00.196
you boys got to be ready
to get your hands dirty

41:00.327 --> 41:02.155
your noses wet, and them
nuts chafed as shit.

41:03.722 --> 41:06.376
And look, if,
if we do our jobs right...

41:06.507 --> 41:09.075
you're gonna have a whole
other problem on your hands.

41:09.205 --> 41:10.729
You're gonna have to learn

41:10.859 --> 41:13.079
to protect yourself
in a zombie apocalypse

41:13.209 --> 41:14.646
of repressed desire.

41:15.647 --> 41:16.648
Any questions?

41:16.778 --> 41:17.736
I have a question.

41:20.086 --> 41:22.305
Can you, you know,
fuck a zombie to death?

41:22.436 --> 41:24.133
Or is it still a kill shot
to the head?

41:25.526 --> 41:27.354
Excuse me,
what are you doing here?

41:27.485 --> 41:29.791
I mean, you didn't
technically fire me,

41:29.922 --> 41:35.101
so I'm still drawing out
that salary.

41:35.231 --> 41:38.757
Oh, I'm sorry. I should
have been more clear.

41:38.887 --> 41:40.062
You're still getting paid,

41:40.193 --> 41:42.108
but we no longer
need your services.

41:44.110 --> 41:45.807
I shouldn't have gotten
my hopes up.

41:45.938 --> 41:49.681
I was just really inspired
by our new director's vision.

41:50.899 --> 41:52.727
What-- Um, what did I say?

41:52.858 --> 41:54.512
He didn't say anything.

41:54.642 --> 41:57.732
It's not what you said.
It's who you are.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.040
Do you have any idea
of how long

42:01.170 --> 42:03.129
I've been dreaming
of someone to walk through

42:03.259 --> 42:05.523
that door with a flame thrower

42:05.653 --> 42:09.048
and burn this whole
fucking shit to the ground?

42:09.178 --> 42:11.398
I can't stand
playing Lady Isabel.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.226
For the last six months,

42:13.356 --> 42:17.099
I've wanted to choke the life
out of that entitled prude.

42:17.230 --> 42:20.189
I mean, get a grip, woman.
Jesus Christ.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.061
Like you're rich,

42:22.191 --> 42:23.758
send a fucking
carriage to town,

42:23.889 --> 42:25.934
buy up
every able-bodied man...

42:26.065 --> 42:28.371
soldier, sailor
instead of wasting your time

42:28.502 --> 42:29.982
worrying about
which boring old sod

42:30.112 --> 42:31.418
you're going
to sign your life away to

42:31.549 --> 42:32.767
and have a lovely

42:32.898 --> 42:36.554
half-decent shag
with every last one! I--

42:42.211 --> 42:46.302
But it's a really good job,
it's so stable, and, um...

42:47.565 --> 42:49.654
so usually
I don't say all of that.

42:49.784 --> 42:51.873
Well, that was poetic.

42:52.004 --> 42:54.354
You're definitely
our audience.

42:54.484 --> 42:56.269
Woody, make sure
she gets an invitation.

42:56.399 --> 42:58.967
Hey, we're still calling this
Isabel Ascendant, right?

42:59.098 --> 43:00.273
Yeah, but that's just a trick

43:00.403 --> 43:01.622
to get the audience
into the theater

43:01.753 --> 43:02.710
so then we can give them
something else.

43:02.841 --> 43:04.320
Right, but if, what if we use

43:04.451 --> 43:06.453
the actual old opening
to  Isabel Ascendant?

43:06.584 --> 43:08.934
I mean, it could be a really
big surprise actually.

43:09.064 --> 43:10.544
And if I'm honest...

43:10.675 --> 43:11.937
if you want to make a show

43:12.067 --> 43:13.503
about women
getting what they want,

43:13.634 --> 43:14.853
wouldn't it be
a little fucking chauvinistic

43:14.983 --> 43:16.158
to not have
a female lead in it?

43:16.289 --> 43:17.246
Are you calling me
chauvinistic?

43:17.377 --> 43:18.508
No.

43:18.639 --> 43:19.771
Because
I'm the feminist here.

43:19.901 --> 43:20.859
-Right.
-I'm the flame-thrower.

43:20.989 --> 43:22.730
This whole thing was my idea.

43:24.340 --> 43:25.994
You heard her.
She's the flame-thrower.

43:26.125 --> 43:28.083
Uh, you're hired as Isabel

43:28.214 --> 43:29.432
because you were
already hired.

43:29.563 --> 43:30.520
Oh.
Go-- I am thrilled!

43:30.651 --> 43:32.000
Thank you both so much.

43:34.176 --> 43:37.310
Will you be dancing in it?

43:37.440 --> 43:40.443
Uh, no. Just, uh, directing.
Right?

43:40.574 --> 43:43.708
Aw, shame.

43:43.838 --> 43:47.929
Well now that we have
a leading lady again

43:48.060 --> 43:49.844
maybe the director
should walk us

43:49.975 --> 43:52.891
through the beats
of the first act.

43:53.021 --> 43:56.590
Yep.
Uh, first act, coming up.

43:56.721 --> 43:58.287
Enter Jackson,

43:58.418 --> 44:00.420
the low-class but sexy friend
of the husband. Line?

44:00.550 --> 44:02.509
Harold said you didn't want
to go to Calais this year.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.858
Is that still settled?

44:03.989 --> 44:05.773
-I'm sick to death of Calais.
-Theo?

44:05.904 --> 44:07.949
I won't hear of it.
You're going and that's that.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.647
Perfect. Hit it.

44:12.127 --> 44:14.303
Oh, come on. No. No. No, no.

44:14.434 --> 44:15.740
Come on, Mike. Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

44:15.870 --> 44:17.524
Hey. All right,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.221
Stop. What's up?

44:19.352 --> 44:21.615
They can't just start dancing
on her out of nowhere.

44:21.746 --> 44:24.313
I mean, I'm down as fuck.

44:24.444 --> 44:25.619
Okay. Uh,
isn't that the point?

44:25.750 --> 44:26.664
No, no, no.

44:26.794 --> 44:28.361
You cannot interrupt the plot.

44:28.491 --> 44:30.102
If you want
a strong female lead

44:30.232 --> 44:31.581
she has to have an objective.

44:31.712 --> 44:33.192
At least we should know
what she wants.

44:33.322 --> 44:35.803
Okay. What do you
think she wants then?

44:35.934 --> 44:39.807
I don't know. I know she
doesn't want this life.

44:39.938 --> 44:41.504
So she wants to run away?

44:41.635 --> 44:43.593
She can't do that.

44:43.724 --> 44:46.161
Why?
She's a free person, right?

44:46.292 --> 44:49.556
She has a family.
There would be consequences.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.210
Right.
So it's about the money.

44:51.340 --> 44:52.733
Oh, that's the least of it.

44:52.864 --> 44:54.953
She would lose her friends,
opportunities.

44:55.083 --> 44:58.696
Her identity. Her whole world
would be torn apart.

44:58.826 --> 45:01.133
I don't know. It sounds to me
that she just needs to let go.

45:01.263 --> 45:03.439
-And some good dick!
-Maybe that as well.

45:03.570 --> 45:07.269
This show is not about
getting dick. Only.

45:08.575 --> 45:10.359
She needs to solve
her dilemma.

45:10.490 --> 45:12.797
It's not like some
magic unicorn is gonna

45:12.927 --> 45:15.495
come down and make all her
wildest fantasies come true.

45:17.018 --> 45:18.759
Uh, what was that?

45:22.502 --> 45:24.504
Could be not the worst idea.

45:26.288 --> 45:27.768
Oh, no way.

45:27.899 --> 45:30.902
Hear me out.
Just-- What about--

45:31.032 --> 45:33.513
Where the fuck am I
gonna get a horse?

45:33.643 --> 45:35.341
What about a  caballito?
Like a tiny one.

45:35.471 --> 45:36.821
I don't have  caballito budget.

45:36.951 --> 45:38.692
Wait. What-- How-- Okay,
what if you don't see it?

45:38.823 --> 45:39.737
What if you don't
see the horse?

45:42.609 --> 45:44.219
No, that's not right.

45:46.482 --> 45:47.483
No.

45:49.790 --> 45:51.531
How long have you
been standing there?

45:51.661 --> 45:54.664
-Long enough. May I?
-Yes.

45:59.408 --> 46:00.627
So you've worked with Max

46:00.758 --> 46:02.716
and this Roger dude
a long time?

46:02.847 --> 46:05.023
All 18 wonderful years.

46:05.153 --> 46:06.764
Wow. So you must know
these friends

46:06.894 --> 46:08.026
that we're going
to see tonight.

46:08.156 --> 46:09.592
What are they like?

46:09.723 --> 46:12.204
Hmm. They like things
to stay the same, sir.

46:13.640 --> 46:15.685
All right.

46:15.816 --> 46:18.079
How do I look? And don't
give me any bullshit answer.

46:19.646 --> 46:21.213
You know something...

46:22.388 --> 46:24.477
they'd just laugh at you
in a tie.

46:33.312 --> 46:35.096
Holy shit.

46:35.227 --> 46:38.447
-What?
-You! That suit.

46:38.578 --> 46:40.710
You look incredibly expensive.

46:41.711 --> 46:43.713
You have no idea.

46:52.418 --> 46:54.550
One of the most
primal feelings

46:54.681 --> 46:57.858
human beings experience
is the desire to belong

46:57.989 --> 46:59.947
to feel connected
to other beings,

47:00.078 --> 47:01.949
and to be part of a tribe.

47:02.080 --> 47:04.038
In fact,
brain scans have shown

47:04.169 --> 47:06.562
that social rejection
creates virtually

47:06.693 --> 47:09.043
identical brain activity
as physical assault.

47:09.174 --> 47:10.915
Mike didn't know that...

47:11.045 --> 47:13.004
but he knew dancing could
bring people together.

47:13.134 --> 47:16.007
Even if some of those
people are snobs.

47:16.137 --> 47:18.487
And he knew
that Victor was right,

47:18.618 --> 47:20.185
they would have laughed
at him in a tie.

47:26.147 --> 47:28.236
And he says, "Now
that's how you wave a towel!"

47:31.674 --> 47:34.112
Anyways, so, give us
the latest gossip, Max.

47:34.242 --> 47:37.289
-Yeah, go on.
-And don't hold back a lick.

47:37.419 --> 47:39.465
You know
I don't hold back my licks.

47:39.595 --> 47:41.554
-True.

47:41.684 --> 47:43.469
But there's nothing for me
to tell you.

47:43.599 --> 47:45.036
You already know everything...

47:45.166 --> 47:48.387
since you double agents
are all talking to Roger.

47:48.517 --> 47:49.649
-Oh, come on.
-That's not true.

47:49.779 --> 47:51.303
-That's not true.
-I'm offended.

47:51.433 --> 47:52.957
Last I heard,

47:53.087 --> 47:55.176
he had at least broken it off
with the girl. So...

47:55.307 --> 47:58.397
And so, she should just run
back to him then, should she?

47:58.527 --> 48:00.312
No, that's not
what I'm implying.

48:00.442 --> 48:02.009
I'm just-- You know,
it's something, isn't it?

48:02.140 --> 48:04.403
-It takes time, Bill.
-Of course.

48:04.533 --> 48:05.883
Or have you forgotten?

48:06.013 --> 48:07.797
Ooh, hello.

48:07.928 --> 48:11.192
Thank you for your concern,
but you must know that...

48:12.672 --> 48:15.283
I'm the happiest
I've ever been in my life.

48:15.414 --> 48:16.676
Oh, that's really good
to hear.

48:16.806 --> 48:17.895
Oh, rubbish.

48:18.025 --> 48:19.635
Phoebe!

48:19.766 --> 48:22.769
He can do whatever he wants,
and so can I.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.466
-Yeah.
-How modern.

48:24.597 --> 48:26.512
But what does that actually
mean for the divorce?

48:26.642 --> 48:28.035
The divorce. The divorce.

48:28.166 --> 48:30.516
Don't you have something else
to talk about?

48:30.646 --> 48:33.301
I mean, besides, uh,
Bill jokes. Let's have fun.

48:33.432 --> 48:34.912
Mike, why don't you
tell them--

48:35.042 --> 48:36.696
-I was just telling--
-Wait, no, listen to this.

48:36.826 --> 48:39.046
You have to hear his vision
for  Isabel Ascendant.

48:39.177 --> 48:40.352
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yes.

48:40.482 --> 48:42.397
Uh, yeah. Well, I mean,

48:42.528 --> 48:44.443
as we were talking about
we think it's, uh...

48:44.573 --> 48:45.923
it's very important to honor,

48:46.053 --> 48:48.490
uh, the original
source material.

48:48.621 --> 48:50.144
Yeah,
but to do that properly--

48:50.275 --> 48:54.279
And say no more.
It has to be a surprise.

48:54.409 --> 48:55.802
-Right.
-Okay.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.151
It's so smart
to revive a classic.

48:57.282 --> 48:58.283
Absolutely.

48:58.413 --> 48:59.588
That is very hot right now.

48:59.719 --> 49:01.155
Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, I don't know

49:01.286 --> 49:02.983
if I would exactly call it
a classic revival...

49:03.114 --> 49:04.680
uh, Phoebe, but I--

49:04.811 --> 49:06.378
You know, the way that I think
we were looking at it is

49:06.508 --> 49:07.553
that it really needed to be
stripped down,

49:07.683 --> 49:08.684
oiled, and spanked.

49:11.165 --> 49:14.168
No. No.

49:14.299 --> 49:16.431
He loves metaphors.

49:16.562 --> 49:19.043
So Mike, is there a vibrant
theatrical community in Miami?

49:19.173 --> 49:20.305
Yeah, for the right amount
of dollars

49:20.435 --> 49:21.349
I think you can have
as vibrant

49:21.480 --> 49:22.481
of a time as you would like.

49:24.309 --> 49:26.441
I imagine you've done a lot
of work with Art Basel.

49:26.572 --> 49:28.487
No, no. I don't-- Who's that?
I don't know him.

49:32.882 --> 49:34.580
-Come on, guys.
-Oh, my God.

49:34.710 --> 49:37.975
Of course, I know Art Basel.
It's the most famous art fair.

49:38.105 --> 49:40.238
It happens in my city
every single year.

49:40.368 --> 49:42.892
-Wow. Your face just now...

49:43.023 --> 49:44.982
Well, I mean, if the show's
anything like him,

49:45.112 --> 49:46.548
count me in.

49:46.679 --> 49:48.420
You better talk to him
while you can because

49:48.550 --> 49:52.424
he's about to get super famous
and super unavailable.

49:52.554 --> 49:53.903
Wow.

49:54.034 --> 49:54.861
Well, that's quite
a build-up.

49:54.992 --> 49:56.123
That's a deal.

49:56.254 --> 49:57.907
I don't know about all that,
but yes.

49:59.300 --> 50:01.650
She is looking unusually
radiant tonight.

50:03.130 --> 50:04.784
Yeah, I guess, um...
I don't know.

50:04.914 --> 50:08.048
It must be good for the soul,
the whole divorce.

50:08.179 --> 50:11.312
-Divorce.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

50:11.443 --> 50:12.661
Yeah, I'm-- What?

50:12.792 --> 50:14.141
Do you guys
have a different word

50:14.272 --> 50:15.621
for the ending
of a marriage here?

50:15.751 --> 50:18.189
Uh, yeah. When it's untrue.
Yeah.

50:18.319 --> 50:20.060
I mean, yes, they have an
agreement at the moment.

50:20.191 --> 50:21.453
Yeah.

50:21.583 --> 50:23.672
But, I mean,
that family pre-nup

50:23.803 --> 50:25.109
is going to take a decade
to litigate.

50:25.239 --> 50:26.501
Exactly.

50:26.632 --> 50:27.633
Plus she knows
that at the end of it

50:27.763 --> 50:28.764
she'll get absolutely nothing.

50:28.895 --> 50:30.331
-Which she'll hate.
-Yeah.

50:30.462 --> 50:31.724
What she needs is to be
able to stay with him,

50:31.854 --> 50:34.422
but not actually be with him.

50:34.553 --> 50:36.033
That would be
the golden ticket.

50:36.163 --> 50:37.469
I wish you had gotten up,

50:37.599 --> 50:39.601
and really taken
your clothes off.

50:39.732 --> 50:40.907
Okay, let's go back there.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.300
I'll take my clothes off
right now.

50:42.430 --> 50:43.431
I would have loved
to see their faces.

50:43.562 --> 50:44.954
-Yeah.
-They are so fake.

50:45.085 --> 50:46.739
They are the fakest people
I know.

50:46.869 --> 50:50.525
I think the only person that
is real in my life is Zadie.

50:50.656 --> 50:52.179
She's about as real
as it gets at times.

50:52.310 --> 50:54.051
Yes. She'll tell you
what she thinks.

50:55.400 --> 50:57.010
What about you, Mike?

50:58.751 --> 51:00.492
Are you real?

51:00.622 --> 51:03.103
What do you mean, am I real?
Am I-- Do you think I'm real?

51:04.278 --> 51:05.279
I don't know.

51:07.064 --> 51:11.068
You know, sometimes
you kind of feel like a dream.

51:11.633 --> 51:13.070
Hmm.

51:13.200 --> 51:15.028
I mean, you look like a dream.

51:15.159 --> 51:16.073
Mm-hmm.

51:18.423 --> 51:20.077
You smell like a dream.

51:20.207 --> 51:21.121
Mm-hmm.

51:23.167 --> 51:25.169
You taste like a dream.

51:32.393 --> 51:35.570
Wait. I just want
to make sure. Listen.

51:35.701 --> 51:37.572
No, it's okay.
No. I get it. I get it.

51:37.703 --> 51:39.183
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

51:39.313 --> 51:41.098
-That was really stupid.
-No, I just--

51:41.141 --> 51:42.577
No, I just want to tell you--
No, no. I'm sorry. I didn't--

51:42.621 --> 51:44.057
You know what? I'm sorry,
I'm just so drunk.

51:44.188 --> 51:45.450
-I shouldn't have stopped--

51:45.580 --> 51:46.973
What? You had, like,
one glass of wine.

51:47.104 --> 51:48.105
No, look, that was my fault.
That was my--

51:48.148 --> 51:49.367
Are you saying I'm crazy?

51:49.497 --> 51:50.455
No, I'm definitely not
saying you're crazy.

51:50.585 --> 51:52.109
Are you telling me I'm crazy?

51:52.239 --> 51:53.371
I'm saying I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to stop you.

51:53.501 --> 51:54.807
Well, this was
uncalled for so...

51:54.937 --> 51:56.156
obviously if I'm not drunk,
I'm crazy.

51:56.287 --> 51:57.462
I didn't mean to stop you.
Come here.

51:57.592 --> 51:58.941
Stop. Hey-- Max, stop.
I'm sorry.

51:59.072 --> 52:00.117
And I'm not crazy.
I am very drunk actually.

52:00.160 --> 52:02.119
Stop. Stop. Listen to my--

52:02.249 --> 52:04.425
No, you stop.
I don't want to listen to you.

52:04.556 --> 52:08.299
Right now, anything that you
say to me is gonna be wrong.

52:09.996 --> 52:13.565
I already said I'm sorry.
Okay? I get it. I get it.

52:13.695 --> 52:16.655
You don't have to like,
rub it in.

52:16.785 --> 52:18.004
All right.

52:18.135 --> 52:20.398
No pity talking or anything.
I get it.

52:26.273 --> 52:29.798
Can you put some music on,
Victor?

52:39.025 --> 52:42.898
♪ Why don't we steal away

52:43.029 --> 52:44.552
♪ Into the night

52:46.859 --> 52:48.687
♪ I know it ain't right

52:59.088 --> 53:01.613
Oh, hello. Good morning.

53:01.743 --> 53:03.005
Good morning.

53:03.136 --> 53:04.659
What are you doing up
so early?

53:04.790 --> 53:06.270
I'm writing a novel.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.708
-A novel?
-Mm-hmm.

53:09.838 --> 53:12.580
They make you write novels
in school over here?

53:12.711 --> 53:14.800
Do you assume that
because of my age

53:14.930 --> 53:15.888
I only have
the mental capacity

53:16.018 --> 53:17.759
to write a novel for school?

53:17.890 --> 53:20.197
No, I just don't know anyone
that's ever written a novel.

53:21.285 --> 53:22.982
What is it about?

53:23.112 --> 53:26.246
It's about some people who
know each other and do things.

53:26.377 --> 53:28.422
It's about every time I draw

53:28.553 --> 53:30.859
another gentrified breath
into my helpless body.

53:30.990 --> 53:33.514
And it's about 40 pages.

53:33.645 --> 53:35.081
That's a good amount of pages.

53:35.212 --> 53:36.169
It is.

53:36.300 --> 53:37.301
How many are you gonna go for?

53:38.258 --> 53:40.042
A few more.

53:40.173 --> 53:41.740
-What's up, Vic?
-Yeah, right.

53:43.916 --> 53:46.658
What? What?
Why is he like that?

53:46.788 --> 53:49.400
If he acts like he likes you,
he hates you.

53:49.530 --> 53:51.228
And if he acts like
he hates you...

53:51.358 --> 53:55.057
it's a sign of respect because
he actually does hate you.

53:55.188 --> 53:58.583
Yeah, that's not helpful.
Why doesn't he just quit?

53:58.713 --> 54:01.542
Same reason you don't quit.
Systemic economic inequality.

54:03.152 --> 54:06.243
Speaking of, have you seen
Maxandra this morning?

54:06.373 --> 54:08.593
No. And why do you
call her that?

54:08.723 --> 54:09.898
You know she hates it.

54:10.029 --> 54:11.291
She brought me
from an orphanage,

54:11.422 --> 54:12.945
saying "mother"
would feel like a lie.

54:13.075 --> 54:15.556
Come on.
That's a little strong.

54:15.687 --> 54:17.602
Look, she's doing
the best she can.

54:17.732 --> 54:19.647
And she loves
the shit out of you.

54:19.778 --> 54:21.388
I think the real question is

54:21.519 --> 54:22.998
why do you love
the shit out of her?

54:26.350 --> 54:28.656
Love is a really,
really big word, Zadie.

54:28.787 --> 54:30.658
And, look, the truth is

54:30.789 --> 54:33.313
no one's believed in me
like your mom has, so I--

54:33.444 --> 54:36.273
-Zadie?
-Hi, Roger.

54:36.403 --> 54:37.752
Hello, dear.

54:37.883 --> 54:39.972
That's your--

54:40.102 --> 54:44.063
-Is your mother around?
-Maxandra is upstairs.

54:44.193 --> 54:45.934
And who's this?

54:46.065 --> 54:47.501
This is Mike.

54:47.632 --> 54:50.330
Mike is the new director
for  Isabel Ascendant.

54:50.461 --> 54:52.767
-Ah, right.
-What's up?

54:53.507 --> 54:54.769
Roger Rattigan.

54:54.900 --> 54:57.468
Michael Jeffrey Lane.

54:57.598 --> 54:58.773
I hope Max didn't schedule

54:58.904 --> 55:00.166
to meet both of us
at the same time.

55:01.472 --> 55:03.300
-He's staying here.
-Ah.

55:03.430 --> 55:06.564
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, no conflict then.

55:07.391 --> 55:09.001
No.

55:09.131 --> 55:11.395
I hope the theater itself
has treated you well thus far.

55:11.525 --> 55:13.614
Oh, she's been a pleasure
to be inside of.

55:13.745 --> 55:15.137
It's got such
a wonderful feel.

55:15.268 --> 55:16.400
I'm looking forward to seeing

55:16.530 --> 55:17.749
how you improve
such a classic.

55:17.879 --> 55:20.012
I can't wait for you
to experience it.

55:24.408 --> 55:26.235
It's a little rough,
so be nice.

55:26.366 --> 55:27.324

That's perfect.

58:15.317 --> 58:16.580
I mean, the only--
If I had a little note

58:16.710 --> 58:18.582
it would just be
this specific dance

58:18.712 --> 58:21.236
is a little more like fucking
than dancing.

58:21.367 --> 58:23.761
And you know, look, the song
is called "Permission,"

58:23.891 --> 58:25.066

No woman
wants to be suffocated

59:48.802 --> 59:49.760

59:49.890 --> 59:51.196
It's nice to expand, you know?

59:51.979 --> 59:53.067
Okay.

59:54.721 --> 59:57.332
Less testiculars
and expansion.

1:00:36.589 --> 1:00:38.112
Some scholars
suggest that dance

1:00:38.243 --> 1:00:39.897
once was a form
of communication

1:00:40.027 --> 1:00:43.161
as integral to our daily life
as eating or sleeping.

1:00:43.291 --> 1:00:45.772
Traditionally,
tribal courtship dances

1:00:45.903 --> 1:00:47.556
allowed dancers
of opposite sexes

1:00:47.687 --> 1:00:49.558
to engage
in socially acceptable

1:00:49.689 --> 1:00:51.473
physical contact
before they were even

1:00:51.604 --> 1:00:53.519
allowed to speak
to one another.

1:00:53.650 --> 1:00:55.303
Only when
a leisure class began

1:00:55.434 --> 1:00:57.741
to emerge out of early
economic development

1:00:57.871 --> 1:00:59.046
did humans begin to view dance

1:00:59.177 --> 1:01:00.395
as a source of pleasure apart

1:01:00.526 --> 1:01:02.223
from its original purpose,

1:01:02.354 --> 1:01:05.009
to bridge people together
from different worlds...

1:01:05.139 --> 1:01:07.664
to heal wounds
when words would not suffice.

1:01:14.758 --> 1:01:15.889
All right, you all ready?

1:01:16.977 --> 1:01:18.544
Play back.

1:01:27.901 --> 1:01:31.513
All right. Stop!
Stop the music! Stop!

1:01:31.644 --> 1:01:34.603
Hey! Excuse me,
who the hell are you?

1:01:38.651 --> 1:01:41.132
Historical Architecture
High Committee.

1:01:41.262 --> 1:01:44.222
Well, I'm the owner of this
theater. Is there a problem?

1:01:45.136 --> 1:01:46.659
Oh, I would think so.

1:01:53.274 --> 1:01:54.406
Anything else?

1:01:56.756 --> 1:01:58.279
You'll be hearing from us.

1:02:03.371 --> 1:02:04.590
We're fucked.

1:02:07.811 --> 1:02:09.726
"The owner must obtain
written approval

1:02:09.856 --> 1:02:11.597
to make material changes

1:02:11.728 --> 1:02:14.556
If changes be made without
approval or special exemption,

1:02:14.687 --> 1:02:15.862
the owner must restore

1:02:15.993 --> 1:02:17.559
the theater
to its original condition

1:02:17.690 --> 1:02:20.693

for approval with the city."

trying to control me.

1:02:23.435 --> 1:02:25.742
Even though we are separated

1:02:25.872 --> 1:02:26.960
and in the middle of a divorce

1:02:27.091 --> 1:02:28.832
because he fucked
the assistant.

1:02:32.357 --> 1:02:33.488
I'm sorry, baby,

1:02:33.619 --> 1:02:34.881
but it's not like
it's a secret.

1:02:36.274 --> 1:02:38.189
What if we just do it anyway?

1:02:38.319 --> 1:02:40.060
I mean, what are they
really gonna do?

1:02:40.191 --> 1:02:41.758
"Failure to comply will result

1:02:41.888 --> 1:02:43.847
in a fine of 10,000 pounds
per day...

1:02:43.977 --> 1:02:46.893
and/or seizure of the property
by the City."

1:02:47.024 --> 1:02:48.765
Even if I pay the fine,

1:02:48.895 --> 1:02:51.724
he'll find a way to exert
pressure on these people

1:02:51.855 --> 1:02:53.595
and force them
to bend the rules.

1:02:53.726 --> 1:02:55.162
That's just the way
he operates.

1:02:55.293 --> 1:02:56.729
-Isn't it, Victor?
-Well, in my opinion--

1:02:56.860 --> 1:02:58.383
We have to go
all the way to the top

1:02:58.513 --> 1:03:00.733
because our freedom
is an illusion.

1:03:00.864 --> 1:03:02.517
Yes, see when you start
with no rights at all--

1:03:02.648 --> 1:03:04.389
So who is this person
we need to seduce

1:03:04.519 --> 1:03:05.782
and get them on our side?

1:03:05.912 --> 1:03:08.001
I.e., the definition
of corruption.

1:03:09.263 --> 1:03:10.699
Zadie, baby...

1:03:12.223 --> 1:03:13.746
you should know that the law

1:03:13.877 --> 1:03:15.530
is useless
when you're dealing

1:03:15.661 --> 1:03:18.098
with entrenched
male power structures.

1:03:18.229 --> 1:03:20.361
-Not all male.
-What do you mean?

1:03:20.492 --> 1:03:21.972
Edna Eaglebauer.

1:03:22.102 --> 1:03:23.538
As the chairwoman,

1:03:23.669 --> 1:03:24.888
she has the power
to grant a special exemption.

1:03:25.018 --> 1:03:27.151
Hey, Z, what else
do we know about Edna?

1:03:33.505 --> 1:03:35.942
Um, not much about her
on Google.

1:03:36.073 --> 1:03:37.596
Housing records indicate

1:03:37.726 --> 1:03:38.771
she's most likely single
and lives alone.

1:03:38.902 --> 1:03:40.817
That's promising.

1:03:40.947 --> 1:03:43.210
Um, she's got
no presence on social media.

1:03:43.341 --> 1:03:46.866
Asides her bio
on the council website.

1:03:46.997 --> 1:03:49.695
Check if she has
a pet or a hobby.

1:03:52.350 --> 1:03:53.830
Not that I can tell.
She's a ghost.

1:04:48.362 --> 1:04:49.494
I'll tell you what...

1:04:49.624 --> 1:04:50.669
this bird's got to have
a heart of stone

1:04:50.799 --> 1:04:52.236
to shut down  Swan Lake.

1:04:52.366 --> 1:04:54.499
Maybe, but everybody
wants something.

1:04:54.629 --> 1:04:56.893
We just got to keep looking.

1:04:57.023 --> 1:04:59.678
What if she didn't even know
what she wants?

1:04:59.808 --> 1:05:01.419
Well, that never stopped men

1:05:01.549 --> 1:05:03.900
from coming up
with the wrong answer.

1:05:04.030 --> 1:05:05.510
Come on, guys,
give me something.

1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:06.946
Victor, don't just sit there.

1:05:07.077 --> 1:05:08.643
I'll murder her
for the right price.

1:05:08.774 --> 1:05:10.210
That might be the best idea.

1:05:10.341 --> 1:05:11.559
But, look, this feels like

1:05:11.690 --> 1:05:13.431
a woman's perspective
sort of a thing.

1:05:13.561 --> 1:05:15.781
Like what did you want
before Miami?

1:05:15.912 --> 1:05:17.391
I just wanted
to escape my life.

1:05:19.698 --> 1:05:21.700
But then...

1:05:21.830 --> 1:05:26.792
someone came along and
gave me this unexpected

1:05:26.923 --> 1:05:32.972
magical moment that made
me remember who I really was.

1:05:33.103 --> 1:05:35.148
It was like a little treasure.

1:05:35.279 --> 1:05:37.934
Okay, so we need to figure out
who Edna was before

1:05:38.064 --> 1:05:40.240
she became a bureaucrat
and tap into that then.

1:05:41.633 --> 1:05:42.677
That's it!

1:07:25.041 --> 1:07:26.694
I don't understand why
you don't want "Suavemente."

1:07:26.825 --> 1:07:28.044
I don't think-- No.
I love "Suavemente."

1:07:28.174 --> 1:07:29.654
It's a great song.

1:07:29.784 --> 1:07:30.959
-It's a different beat.
-It is great. I agree.

1:07:31.090 --> 1:07:32.396
We just don't need it
right now.

1:07:32.526 --> 1:07:33.745
Look, it-- Look,
hear me out. It's Isabel...

1:07:33.875 --> 1:07:35.094
Unicorn, "Champagne,"
"Sex Machine..."

1:07:35.225 --> 1:07:36.400
-Oh, trust me...
-"Permission," "Suits."

1:07:36.530 --> 1:07:37.705
I know it by heart.
And you know what's more

1:07:37.836 --> 1:07:39.011
important than "Suavemente"?

1:07:39.142 --> 1:07:40.621
We still don't have
a grand finale.

1:07:40.752 --> 1:07:42.058
Well, great. We'll make one.
It's a group number.

1:07:42.188 --> 1:07:43.537
Most important part
of the whole show.

1:07:43.581 --> 1:07:44.582
And then everybody
will dance out into the crowd.

1:07:44.625 --> 1:07:45.931
It'll be amazing.

1:07:46.062 --> 1:07:48.064
-Oh, that's so random.
-Why is that random?

1:07:48.194 --> 1:07:49.152
Everybody dancing
in the crowd.

1:07:49.282 --> 1:07:50.501
We've done that already.

1:07:50.631 --> 1:07:51.719
It's got to be
something different,

1:07:51.850 --> 1:07:53.243
something personal.

1:07:53.373 --> 1:07:54.679
They're all good and personal,

1:07:54.809 --> 1:07:55.984
and they're there
for a reason. I don't--

1:07:56.115 --> 1:07:57.725
Why are you doing this
right now?

1:07:57.856 --> 1:08:00.119
Why are you making it, like,
we don't have a good show?

1:08:00.250 --> 1:08:03.296
I know. You should be
dancing in it.

1:08:03.427 --> 1:08:05.820
You have lost your mind.
What are you talking about?

1:08:05.951 --> 1:08:07.300
I'm not dancing in the show.

1:08:07.431 --> 1:08:08.867
Why are you saying no
to everything I say?

1:08:08.997 --> 1:08:10.347
-I'm not saying no.
-Have you noticed that?

1:08:10.477 --> 1:08:12.175
I've said yes on every
single part of the show.

1:08:12.305 --> 1:08:15.569
We need something climactic,
different, something personal.

1:08:15.700 --> 1:08:17.876
Great, then do
something personal.

1:08:18.006 --> 1:08:19.312
Give me something
that I don't know about you.

1:08:19.443 --> 1:08:21.314
Why is it about me?
This is about women.

1:08:21.445 --> 1:08:22.881
You're a woman. I'm not.

1:08:23.011 --> 1:08:24.187
I'm not gonna be dancing
in the show.

1:08:24.317 --> 1:08:25.623
Why don't you
make it personal?

1:08:25.753 --> 1:08:27.146
Well, do whatever you want.

1:08:27.277 --> 1:08:28.930
Do the thing that you and
Antonio have been making.

1:08:29.061 --> 1:08:31.107
It's great.
That's personal, ain't it?

1:08:31.237 --> 1:08:33.152
Hey, it's your show.

1:08:33.283 --> 1:08:34.980
Give me something
that's yours.

1:08:35.111 --> 1:08:36.895
Open up.

1:08:37.025 --> 1:08:39.071
-I did.
-When?

1:08:39.202 --> 1:08:40.812
The whole--
This whole time.

1:08:40.942 --> 1:08:42.205
And if you haven't seen it,

1:08:42.335 --> 1:08:43.902
I don't know
what to tell you about it.

1:08:44.032 --> 1:08:45.338
Well, I don't know what
to tell you about it since

1:08:45.469 --> 1:08:47.558
I tried to kiss you
and you pulled away.

1:08:47.688 --> 1:08:49.516
You don't know how to open up.

1:08:49.647 --> 1:08:51.431
That's why you need
the "Suavemente."

1:08:51.562 --> 1:08:55.348
Oh! Still waiting for passing
trade, you nosy fuck!

1:08:55.479 --> 1:08:58.134
Your turn; he's impossible.

1:09:15.238 --> 1:09:16.804
Yes, Victor?

1:09:16.935 --> 1:09:18.502
I did not say anything.

1:09:18.632 --> 1:09:20.156
Yeah. Yeah. You're always
saying something in your head.

1:09:20.286 --> 1:09:21.635
Just say it out loud, man.

1:09:23.985 --> 1:09:26.858
You see,
the problem with Max is

1:09:26.988 --> 1:09:29.165
she tends to
overcomplicate things.

1:09:29.295 --> 1:09:30.731
Yeah.

1:09:30.862 --> 1:09:33.038
Especially when she knows
exactly what she wants.

1:09:33.169 --> 1:09:35.083
And she knows exactly
what she wants

1:09:35.214 --> 1:09:36.302
when it comes to you.

1:09:41.916 --> 1:09:43.657
Why do you work for her?

1:09:43.788 --> 1:09:45.398
You could easily
work for Roger.

1:09:46.791 --> 1:09:48.401
She's got bigger balls.

1:09:52.536 --> 1:09:53.885
Listen, motherfucker.

1:09:54.015 --> 1:09:55.147
-I rest my case.
-Yeah.

1:09:55.278 --> 1:09:56.670
You better make up your mind

1:09:56.801 --> 1:09:58.063
because you're
driving me crazy.

1:09:58.194 --> 1:09:59.195
Oh, just-- Yeah,
you're driving me crazy.

1:09:59.325 --> 1:10:00.500
What are you doing?

1:10:00.631 --> 1:10:01.849
Just stop.

1:10:01.980 --> 1:10:04.243
-Okay, just shut up.
-No, you stop.

1:10:04.374 --> 1:10:06.376
You shut up.

1:10:06.506 --> 1:10:09.074
I just want a happy ending.

1:10:13.034 --> 1:10:15.254
You're an insane
person. You know that, right?

1:10:15.385 --> 1:10:16.734
Mm-hmm.

1:10:44.892 --> 1:10:46.938
Given the debate
and confusion

1:10:47.068 --> 1:10:49.157
around the word
"love" generally...

1:10:49.288 --> 1:10:51.421
what are we to make
of the word "love"

1:10:51.551 --> 1:10:53.423
in the context of dancing?

1:10:53.553 --> 1:10:55.903
If you love dancing
with someone,

1:10:56.034 --> 1:10:58.645
does that mean on some level
that you love them?

1:10:58.776 --> 1:11:01.909
What other feelings are
exchanged during a dance?

1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:04.434
Can you dance with someone
you don't trust?

1:11:04.564 --> 1:11:07.524
Should you trust someone
just because they can dance?

1:11:07.654 --> 1:11:10.004
Max and Mike weren't
thinking about this,

1:11:10.135 --> 1:11:11.484
but they should have been.

1:11:11.615 --> 1:11:13.138
Stop the music!

1:11:13.269 --> 1:11:15.619
Stop the music!
Stop the music.

1:11:16.837 --> 1:11:18.274
-Edna?
-Edna?

1:11:18.404 --> 1:11:20.145
I am so sorry, Ms. Mendoza.

1:11:20.276 --> 1:11:21.755
I am so deeply sorry

1:11:21.886 --> 1:11:24.323
to each and every one of you
beautiful creatures.

1:11:24.454 --> 1:11:25.672
Sorry for what?

1:11:25.803 --> 1:11:27.413
Height restrictions
for stage risers.

1:11:27.544 --> 1:11:29.110
Apparently, your new stage

1:11:29.241 --> 1:11:30.503
is three quarters of an inch
too high.

1:11:30.634 --> 1:11:32.157
Your exemption
has been denied.

1:11:32.288 --> 1:11:34.725
You're to shut down
immediately.

1:11:34.855 --> 1:11:36.901
But you had already
approved it!

1:11:37.031 --> 1:11:40.861
I got a call from an
MP's office. It's law.

1:11:40.992 --> 1:11:42.298
There's nothing I can do.

1:11:44.561 --> 1:11:47.781
Keep working. I'll take care
of this. I'll be right back.

1:11:47.912 --> 1:11:48.869
Okay.

1:12:03.710 --> 1:12:05.886
How fucking dare you?

1:12:06.017 --> 1:12:08.672
You're not shutting me
down again. Not this time.

1:12:08.802 --> 1:12:11.631
Max, I sincerely
want to rebuild our trust.

1:12:11.762 --> 1:12:13.024
-In the meantime,

1:12:13.154 --> 1:12:14.982
I'm just trying
to look out for you.

1:12:15.113 --> 1:12:17.245
How is shutting down my show
looking out for me?

1:12:17.376 --> 1:12:18.595
I'm not talking
about the show.

1:12:18.725 --> 1:12:19.900
Then what are you
talking about?

1:12:20.031 --> 1:12:21.946
I'm talking
about your judgment.

1:12:22.076 --> 1:12:24.122
I'm talking what I witnessed
in the kitchen

1:12:24.252 --> 1:12:25.384
in front of our daughter.

1:12:25.515 --> 1:12:28.039
Roger, I wouldn't
get into a dispute

1:12:28.169 --> 1:12:29.867
about judgment with me
right now.

1:12:29.997 --> 1:12:33.392
You handed my family's theater
over to a fucking stripper.

1:12:35.133 --> 1:12:37.396
You don't know anything
about Mike.

1:12:37.527 --> 1:12:41.008
I know when you're being used.
Don't you see that?

1:12:41.487 --> 1:12:42.488
No.

1:12:43.881 --> 1:12:46.884
Darling, I know
we're all getting old,

1:12:47.014 --> 1:12:49.365
but I didn't know
you were so desperate.

1:12:49.495 --> 1:12:52.585
Fuck you!
We care for each other.

1:12:52.716 --> 1:12:55.632
Max, have you even read
our settlement agreement?

1:12:55.762 --> 1:12:59.200
The language about denigrating
or harming the family brand?

1:12:59.331 --> 1:13:01.115
The moment that show goes up,

1:13:01.246 --> 1:13:03.030
mother's barristers
will be clawing back

1:13:03.161 --> 1:13:04.945
every last shilling in court

1:13:05.076 --> 1:13:06.773
and I won't be able
to stop her.

1:13:06.904 --> 1:13:10.211
But if you're still too
deluded to help yourself,

1:13:10.342 --> 1:13:12.518
please be mindful of Zadie.

1:13:12.649 --> 1:13:15.695
She shouldn't have to pay
the price for your fantasies.

1:13:21.571 --> 1:13:22.789
Would you please stop it?

1:13:22.920 --> 1:13:24.704
What?

1:13:24.835 --> 1:13:26.489
I know what you're thinking.

1:13:26.619 --> 1:13:28.404
You're thinking,
"What was she thinking?"

1:13:28.534 --> 1:13:30.144
You weren't thinking,
were you?

1:13:30.275 --> 1:13:31.407
You were falling in love.

1:13:31.537 --> 1:13:33.104
Oh, shut the fuck up.

1:13:33.234 --> 1:13:34.845
You think I don't know that?

1:13:34.975 --> 1:13:37.282
And don't you dare judge me.
You were not there.

1:13:37.413 --> 1:13:39.676
That one fucking dance...

1:13:40.677 --> 1:13:42.505
changed everything in me.

1:13:45.508 --> 1:13:49.642
It feels like it made me
the best version of myself...

1:13:49.773 --> 1:13:51.035
but everybody's
laughing at me.

1:13:51.165 --> 1:13:52.863
I'm a joke. An embarrassment.

1:13:54.430 --> 1:13:56.475
Not to him though.

1:13:58.695 --> 1:14:00.523
He believes in me.

1:14:00.653 --> 1:14:02.394
I have to go tell him

1:14:02.525 --> 1:14:05.658
that our show about empowering
women is dead...

1:14:05.789 --> 1:14:08.400
because I'm so
fucking powerless.

1:14:10.315 --> 1:14:12.839
The most frightening part
is that...

1:14:12.970 --> 1:14:15.015
I'm about to find out
if that dance

1:14:15.146 --> 1:14:17.975
meant as much to him
as it did to me.

1:14:19.890 --> 1:14:23.850
Or if I'm just another
goddamn Tuesday.

1:14:23.981 --> 1:14:26.026
No, you're more like
a Thursday, madame.

1:14:28.551 --> 1:14:31.205
Have I always
been this adolescent?

1:14:31.336 --> 1:14:34.426
No. Only when it's raining.

1:14:36.994 --> 1:14:40.650
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

1:14:40.780 --> 1:14:41.999
One.

1:14:42.129 --> 1:14:43.087
Mike.

1:14:45.045 --> 1:14:47.047
Uh, Jack, keep taking
them through.

1:14:52.183 --> 1:14:54.359
What the fuck you mean
"we're done"?

1:14:54.490 --> 1:14:59.059
I'm sorry. I did my best,
but I failed.

1:14:59.190 --> 1:15:01.105
-Wait. What-- All right.
-Victor will come back

1:15:01.235 --> 1:15:02.628
and pick you up,

1:15:02.759 --> 1:15:04.151
and he can arrange
a flight for you tomorrow.

1:15:04.282 --> 1:15:06.414
No, no, no. What happened?
This isn't you.

1:15:06.545 --> 1:15:07.981
What the fuck is going on
with you, Max?

1:15:12.551 --> 1:15:13.857
Nothing.

1:15:13.987 --> 1:15:16.512
What? Un-fucking-believable.

1:15:16.642 --> 1:15:19.645
You really are the Queen of
the First Act, huh? Holy shit.

1:15:22.605 --> 1:15:23.867
You don't know
anything about me.

1:15:23.997 --> 1:15:25.912
And you don't
understand anything.

1:15:26.043 --> 1:15:27.523
It's Friday.

1:15:27.653 --> 1:15:30.221
They wouldn't pull the plug
on us until Monday.

1:15:30.351 --> 1:15:32.005
But you're walking away.

1:15:32.136 --> 1:15:34.138
You have no show.

1:15:34.268 --> 1:15:36.270
You couldn't even come up
with an ending.

1:15:36.401 --> 1:15:38.098
You cannot say that
what we've created so far

1:15:38.229 --> 1:15:39.622
isn't fucking special.

1:15:39.752 --> 1:15:41.624
You cannot say that.
I know you can't.

1:15:46.454 --> 1:15:50.371
I'm sorry, but we're gonna
have to let it go.

1:15:52.765 --> 1:15:54.593
You'll still get paid.

1:15:54.724 --> 1:15:57.727
Hey! Hey, look, I don't give
a fuck about the money.

1:15:57.857 --> 1:15:59.119
I don't fucking care.

1:15:59.685 --> 1:16:01.165
Okay?

1:16:01.295 --> 1:16:02.862
We're good at this
and I'm not gonna

1:16:02.993 --> 1:16:04.690
fucking just let us
give up on it.

1:16:04.821 --> 1:16:06.083
You're so good at this.

1:16:08.520 --> 1:16:12.785
I bet you he never cared about
what you were good at. Did he?

1:16:17.224 --> 1:16:18.878
Don't let this be the end.

1:16:25.842 --> 1:16:26.843
Uh. Uh.

1:17:05.708 --> 1:17:07.623
-Woody!
-Lay it on me, gov.

1:17:07.753 --> 1:17:09.668
I need a plumber
and a ballerina.

1:17:11.539 --> 1:17:14.412
The princess
is on a hunger strike.

1:17:14.542 --> 1:17:15.935
Won't even open the door.

1:17:16.066 --> 1:17:17.284
What? She's not even drinking?

1:17:17.415 --> 1:17:18.938
I'm afraid not.

1:17:19.069 --> 1:17:21.549
Did you try using your
"wise British butler" voice?

1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:26.380
Trust me, I went full metal
Downton Abbey on her ass.

1:17:26.511 --> 1:17:29.645
And if that bloke doesn't pull
his head from his own ass...

1:17:29.775 --> 1:17:32.038
you'll be parented
from behind a closed door

1:17:32.169 --> 1:17:34.127
for months. Years, even.

1:17:34.258 --> 1:17:37.000
But you didn't tell her
you slipped Mike the keys?

1:17:37.130 --> 1:17:38.871
Please.

1:17:39.002 --> 1:17:41.657
If the lawyers found out
her careless manservant...

1:17:41.787 --> 1:17:43.267
failed to lock
The Rattigan doors,

1:17:43.397 --> 1:17:45.573
she'll need
plausible deniability.

1:17:45.704 --> 1:17:47.184
If there's anything
I've learned,

1:17:47.314 --> 1:17:49.186
it's that you can't tell
people anything.

1:17:49.316 --> 1:17:50.927
They have to have
an experience.

1:17:54.017 --> 1:17:55.148
Message from Mike.

1:17:56.759 --> 1:17:58.108
"End is not ending.

1:17:58.238 --> 1:18:00.545
"Sunday at- 00 we roll.
The Grand Finale."

1:18:00.676 --> 1:18:01.851
Let me see that.

1:18:04.070 --> 1:18:06.290
Crikey, it's a haiku.

1:18:06.420 --> 1:18:10.207
Seventeen syllables
in a five-seven-five pattern.

1:18:10.337 --> 1:18:12.688
Purely coincidence,
but still...

1:18:12.818 --> 1:18:14.646
there's hope for him
after all.

1:18:14.777 --> 1:18:17.344
Sounds like Sunday's
gonna be an experience.

1:18:17.475 --> 1:18:19.825
Doesn't it just?

1:20:04.016 --> 1:20:05.583
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:20:09.195 --> 1:20:10.240
Follow me.

1:20:22.295 --> 1:20:24.210
Put some clothes on, Maxandra.

1:20:27.431 --> 1:20:29.085
Why would I do that?

1:20:29.215 --> 1:20:30.521
We have to go.

1:20:32.566 --> 1:20:33.916
Where?

1:20:34.046 --> 1:20:35.308
You know where.

1:20:40.661 --> 1:20:42.185
-He didn't.
-He did.

1:20:42.315 --> 1:20:44.448
No, he didn't.

1:20:44.578 --> 1:20:49.061
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No.
No, it's gonna be a disaster.

1:20:49.192 --> 1:20:50.410
No, it's not.

1:20:50.541 --> 1:20:52.064
Oh, it's going to be
a disaster.

1:20:52.195 --> 1:20:53.761
No, no, no. I can't. I can't.
Uh, uh, no.

1:20:53.892 --> 1:20:55.198
-Yes, you can.
-No, I can't go.

1:20:55.328 --> 1:20:56.590
Come on.

1:20:56.721 --> 1:20:58.288
No, I won't go
and you can't make me.

1:20:58.418 --> 1:20:59.680
Mom.

1:21:01.552 --> 1:21:02.858
We have to go.

1:21:28.753 --> 1:21:30.886
Here you go. There.

1:21:31.016 --> 1:21:32.278
Victor.

1:21:35.455 --> 1:21:36.935
The rumors
about the show

1:21:37.066 --> 1:21:39.416
were a form of entertainment
for some.

1:21:39.546 --> 1:21:41.853
But for the two people
who created it,

1:21:41.984 --> 1:21:43.724
the terror of
the opening night

1:21:43.855 --> 1:21:45.683
could only be managed
by remembering

1:21:45.813 --> 1:21:47.903
there would be
no record of it.

1:21:48.033 --> 1:21:51.428
Only the people who were
there would ever experience

1:21:51.558 --> 1:21:55.040
the story of Max and Mike
as told through dance.

1:21:55.171 --> 1:21:56.650
There's small ships,
there's tall ships,

1:21:56.781 --> 1:21:58.435
there're ships
that sail the sea...

1:21:58.565 --> 1:21:59.871
there's no ships
like friendships,

1:22:00.002 --> 1:22:02.395
so here's to you and me.
One, two, three.

1:22:02.526 --> 1:22:03.831
Let's go.

1:22:03.962 --> 1:22:05.311
We are strippers!

1:22:06.530 --> 1:22:07.618
Whoo!

1:22:23.373 --> 1:22:24.461
All right, man.

1:22:24.591 --> 1:22:26.332
-Let's go.
-Yes.

1:22:26.463 --> 1:22:29.466
Break a leg, everyone.
Alex, cue one and sound. Go.

1:22:41.217 --> 1:22:42.392
The light is different.

1:22:43.871 --> 1:22:45.395
It's November. It's lower.

1:22:50.617 --> 1:22:51.923
Harold's worried about lunch.

1:22:52.054 --> 1:22:53.620
He said the menu
is diabolical.

1:22:53.751 --> 1:22:55.971
The menu is diabolical?

1:22:56.101 --> 1:22:57.668
How can a menu be diabolical?

1:22:57.798 --> 1:22:59.844
Only a person
can be diabolical.

1:22:59.975 --> 1:23:01.498
A menu isn't alive.

1:23:01.628 --> 1:23:03.021
Well, either way,
he's worried.

1:23:03.152 --> 1:23:04.544
And you're worried about him?

1:23:04.675 --> 1:23:06.242
I don't envy him finding out.

1:23:06.372 --> 1:23:08.287
-Well, I'll tell him.
-Isabel, no. It's impossible.

1:23:08.418 --> 1:23:10.159
-He has to know.
-He can never know.

1:23:11.551 --> 1:23:12.552
Harold.

1:23:13.771 --> 1:23:16.339
Hello, darling. Walter.

1:23:17.818 --> 1:23:19.124
Drinks?

1:23:19.255 --> 1:23:20.691
Will you still be
going to Calais?

1:23:20.821 --> 1:23:23.694
No. I've decided
to spend the summer here.

1:23:23.824 --> 1:23:26.697
You see, Isabel is pregnant.

1:23:26.827 --> 1:23:29.047
Oh. Congratulations.

1:23:29.178 --> 1:23:31.658
Yes.
We are very pleased.

1:23:31.789 --> 1:23:34.183
We are hoping
to have a son, of course.

1:23:34.313 --> 1:23:37.838
That way the legacy of
Chuffingham will be secure.

1:23:37.969 --> 1:23:41.233
And if not,
we will keep trying.

1:23:41.364 --> 1:23:44.889
One of the benefits
of having a young wife.

1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:47.239
I'm sure Isabel
will make a wonderful mother.

1:23:47.370 --> 1:23:51.200
No doubt.
And of course my mother

1:23:51.330 --> 1:23:53.202
will be here to help.

1:23:53.332 --> 1:23:54.855
Unicorn! Unicorn! Unicorn!

1:24:04.256 --> 1:24:05.866
- Hello, Lady Isabel.

1:24:05.997 --> 1:24:07.477
Unicorn?

1:24:07.607 --> 1:24:12.047
Why, yes, it's me, Unicorn.
Did you call for me?

1:24:12.177 --> 1:24:15.572
Yeah, but I didn't expect you
to show up out of the blue.

1:24:15.702 --> 1:24:16.877
I haven't spoken
to my imaginary friend

1:24:17.008 --> 1:24:18.053
since I was a child.

1:24:20.229 --> 1:24:21.491
Am I okay?

1:24:21.621 --> 1:24:23.188
Hmm, well, that depends

1:24:23.319 --> 1:24:25.277
on what your definition
of okay is

1:24:25.408 --> 1:24:27.975
but first things first,

1:24:28.106 --> 1:24:30.108
why don't you tell us
how you really feel.

1:24:43.252 --> 1:24:44.644
Well...

1:24:47.212 --> 1:24:48.213
I don't know.

1:24:50.346 --> 1:24:53.044
These two guys shouldn't be
my only two options

1:24:53.175 --> 1:24:55.090
in the world, should they?

1:24:55.220 --> 1:24:59.572
I mean, why do I even need
to feel like I choose?

1:24:59.703 --> 1:25:02.227
Like, it's between
the shitty rich guy

1:25:02.358 --> 1:25:04.011
and the poor guy
with a heart of gold.

1:25:04.142 --> 1:25:07.493
I mean, come on,
all I really want right now

1:25:07.624 --> 1:25:09.016
is to tell these boring

1:25:09.147 --> 1:25:12.846
bags of dicks
to leave me alone!

1:25:15.849 --> 1:25:17.808
That's right,
Lady Isabel.

1:25:17.938 --> 1:25:19.331
See, I'm here to tell you

1:25:19.462 --> 1:25:21.203
that you can have
anything you want.

1:25:21.333 --> 1:25:23.857
All you have to do is ask.

1:25:23.988 --> 1:25:27.687
What? Okay. Really?

1:25:28.819 --> 1:25:31.082
-Really.
-Okay.

1:25:31.213 --> 1:25:36.566
Well, I am a modest lady,
so...

1:25:36.696 --> 1:25:39.699
what if all I wanted
was just a guy

1:25:39.830 --> 1:25:41.658
in a tank top and some jeans?

1:25:48.143 --> 1:25:51.624
Okay, well,
if I can have that then...

1:25:51.755 --> 1:25:53.322
what about a bad boy--

1:25:53.452 --> 1:25:55.150
hold up, hold up--

1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:57.108
who always responds
to my texts.

1:25:59.545 --> 1:26:02.287
Ooh. All right.

1:26:02.418 --> 1:26:07.249
And now,
if I can have that then...

1:26:07.379 --> 1:26:12.167
a sexy CEO who pays his
women more than his men!

1:26:14.081 --> 1:26:16.432
-Ooh, me-ow.

1:26:16.562 --> 1:26:18.477
What about a guy with a puppy?

1:26:24.091 --> 1:26:26.268
Okay, let me just swallow
my saliva

1:26:26.398 --> 1:26:28.444
that's literally dripping out
of my mouth right now.

1:26:28.574 --> 1:26:31.273
If I could have all of that,
why stop there?

1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:44.068
Wait a minute.

1:26:44.199 --> 1:26:47.202
I can't be the only person
in this room

1:26:47.332 --> 1:26:48.942
to feel what I'm feeling
right now. Am I?

1:26:49.073 --> 1:26:50.335
No!

1:26:50.466 --> 1:26:51.771
I didn't think so.

1:26:51.902 --> 1:26:54.209
I can tell by the looks
on your faces.

1:26:54.339 --> 1:26:57.603
Now I want every single one
of you to know

1:26:57.734 --> 1:27:01.303
how I'm feeling
right this very second.

1:27:01.433 --> 1:27:04.262
I managed to have
a little bit of everything.

1:27:04.393 --> 1:27:07.744
And now, it's your turn.

1:27:07.874 --> 1:27:11.400
So, by the power vested in me
through this Magic Mike...

1:27:11.530 --> 1:27:16.666
I command thee, Unicorn,
send everything to us all

1:27:16.796 --> 1:27:18.755
right now!

1:28:44.362 --> 1:28:45.320
Uh...

1:29:08.343 --> 1:29:10.736
Hey!

1:29:10.867 --> 1:29:13.217
♪ Single ladies!
I can't hear ya! ♪

1:29:13.348 --> 1:29:16.525
♪ Single ladies! Make noise!

1:29:16.655 --> 1:29:18.701
♪ What's your zodiac sign?

1:29:18.831 --> 1:29:21.138
♪ What's your zodiac sign?

1:29:21.268 --> 1:29:23.183

How do you feel about

1:29:55.868 --> 1:30:00.656
Make some bloody noise.

1:30:00.786 --> 1:30:04.747
Give it up. Give it up
for these gorgeous lads

1:30:04.877 --> 1:30:08.141
who busted into a sweat
just for all of you.

1:30:08.272 --> 1:30:10.187
Come on, make a little noise.

1:30:12.276 --> 1:30:15.148
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:30:15.279 --> 1:30:18.761
That's what I like to hear.
That's what I love to hear.

1:30:18.891 --> 1:30:20.719
A little bit of noise
on this stage

1:30:20.850 --> 1:30:22.808
doesn't go amiss, sweethearts.

1:30:22.939 --> 1:30:26.638
And let me tell you one thing,
a body at rest...

1:30:26.769 --> 1:30:29.206
is a body at rest. Right?

1:30:29.336 --> 1:30:32.992
Eh, you know, not bad.
But a body in motion...

1:30:36.605 --> 1:30:41.697
There is absolutely
nothing sexier...

1:30:41.827 --> 1:30:44.439
than a body in motion.
Am I right?

1:30:48.704 --> 1:30:52.011
So for our next act,
I want you to give it up...

1:30:52.142 --> 1:30:53.317
ladies and gentlemen

1:30:53.448 --> 1:30:56.799
for the trickster prince
him bloody self.

1:30:56.929 --> 1:31:02.021
Give it up, everybody,
for Mr. JD Rainey.

1:31:03.849 --> 1:31:05.634

by James Brown plays]

1:34:48.117 --> 1:34:50.380
-I think we should leave now.
-Where are we going?

1:34:50.510 --> 1:34:51.947
Mike said to leave
at the end of "Suits"

1:34:52.077 --> 1:34:53.296
and return
at the end of "Pony."

1:34:53.426 --> 1:34:55.211
Oh, yes, yes. So you go.

1:34:55.341 --> 1:34:59.345
And no peeking.
He'll be watching you.

1:34:59.476 --> 1:35:02.392
Now folks,
this next dance

1:35:02.522 --> 1:35:05.308
is one that
I'm well-acquainted with.

1:35:05.438 --> 1:35:09.660
Things are about
to get intimate.

1:35:12.576 --> 1:35:17.102
Now, a real man isn't afraid
to act on his desire...

1:35:17.233 --> 1:35:20.802
but the sexiest act
of submission...

1:35:20.932 --> 1:35:23.892
is asking for permission.

1:37:17.919 --> 1:37:19.268
-Break a leg, gov.

1:37:19.398 --> 1:37:20.573
Aw, bless ya.

1:37:36.067 --> 1:37:38.069
I know. I know.

1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:40.637
We all want
a little bit of everything

1:37:40.767 --> 1:37:42.857
all of the time. Don't we?

1:37:42.987 --> 1:37:44.249
But...

1:37:44.380 --> 1:37:47.513
sometimes you just want to be

1:37:47.644 --> 1:37:51.343
everything to someone. Right?

1:37:53.519 --> 1:37:58.046
Sometimes, the greatest
fantasy of them all...

1:37:58.176 --> 1:38:00.265
is knowing
that you're the only one.

1:43:22.631 --> 1:43:24.763
You said to go hard,
and so I did what you said.

1:43:24.894 --> 1:43:25.982
I mean, you know.

1:43:26.112 --> 1:43:27.070
Oh, God.

1:43:27.201 --> 1:43:28.158
We showed up.

1:43:34.904 --> 1:43:35.948
That's "Pony."

1:43:36.079 --> 1:43:37.254
Mike said after "Pony."

1:43:37.385 --> 1:43:39.169
No, he just said "Pony."

1:43:39.300 --> 1:43:41.040
He definitely said
after "Pony"

1:43:41.171 --> 1:43:43.173
and they're still
on their ponies. Now sit.

1:44:34.311 --> 1:44:35.269
Yes!

1:44:45.366 --> 1:44:47.411
Come on, they're applauding.
It must be over now.

1:44:47.542 --> 1:44:48.760
Very well.

1:45:06.909 --> 1:45:08.737
So amazing.

1:45:14.133 --> 1:45:16.005
Wait a minute. Just a second.

1:45:16.135 --> 1:45:17.702
Thank you very much, Mr. Mike.

1:45:17.833 --> 1:45:19.095
Very nice, my friend.

1:45:37.592 --> 1:45:39.550
-You look beautiful.
-Congratulations.

1:45:39.681 --> 1:45:42.205
-Huh?
-Congratulations. You did it.

1:45:42.336 --> 1:45:43.337
What are you talking about?
We did it.

1:45:43.467 --> 1:45:44.816
You did it. It was amazing.

1:45:44.860 --> 1:45:45.861
Look around.
All this is because of you.

1:45:45.904 --> 1:45:47.210
You are sublime.

1:45:47.341 --> 1:45:48.907
Look, I just want you to know
I love you. Okay?

1:45:55.174 --> 1:45:56.480
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1:45:56.611 --> 1:45:57.873
If you're not gonna leave him,

1:45:58.003 --> 1:46:00.136
I don't want this
to be more confusing.

1:46:00.266 --> 1:46:05.097
It's done. I'm never, ever,
ever going back to him.

1:46:05.228 --> 1:46:08.579
I am free and I am broke.

1:46:08.710 --> 1:46:11.843
What do you mean? You're--
What do you mean you're broke?

1:46:11.974 --> 1:46:13.715
-Yeah.
-Like broke, broke?

1:46:15.369 --> 1:46:17.501
I'm s-- I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1:46:17.632 --> 1:46:19.024
It's okay. I don't care.

1:46:19.155 --> 1:46:22.724
No, I'm-- I'm just--
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:46:31.689 --> 1:46:32.821
I hate you.

1:46:39.697 --> 1:46:41.438
Come on, let's go.

1:46:45.964 --> 1:46:47.575
No one can claim

1:46:47.705 --> 1:46:50.578
to fully understand
what exactly dance is...

1:46:50.708 --> 1:46:52.406
but what is abundantly clear

1:46:52.536 --> 1:46:56.105
is that dance seeks
no meaning for its desires.

1:46:56.235 --> 1:47:00.675
It does not value age
or status, logic or reason.

1:47:00.805 --> 1:47:04.113
It is a compass orientated
only to liberty,

1:47:04.243 --> 1:47:05.984
not unlike the human heart.

1:47:06.115 --> 1:47:07.986
I stumbled upon these wisdoms

1:47:08.117 --> 1:47:12.426
when I met a lonely stripper
named Mike.
