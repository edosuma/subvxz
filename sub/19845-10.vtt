(man shouting orders)

00:15.859 --> 00:17.046
(helicopter buzzing)

00:17.895 --> 00:19.531
(indistinct police radio chatter)

00:21.231 --> 00:22.382
(guns cocking)

00:27.117 --> 00:28.578
(both speak indiscernibly)

(breathes deeply)

00:37.547 --> 00:38.578
(beeps)

00:42.318 --> 00:44.884
Female voice: Mm-mm-mm!
It's a damn shame

00:44.920 --> 00:46.929
she's not gonna make it
out of that building alive.

00:47.361 --> 00:49.593
But then again, no one will.

00:50.094 --> 00:51.179
I loved her.

00:51.495 --> 00:54.063
Sam... well, The Reporter
as you know her...

00:54.098 --> 00:56.570
she wasn't my first owner
or even my second.

00:56.595 --> 00:59.929
See, I'm an old dog.
I've had many lives.

00:59.954 --> 01:02.603
Some people gave me up
because they had kids.

01:02.639 --> 01:04.194
Some people just ran out of money.

01:04.226 --> 01:06.374
Some people didn't want to
deal with the, you know...

01:06.409 --> 01:10.111
(farts) I mean, I get it.
I come with baggage.

01:10.147 --> 01:12.312
<i>You have to ball up
a little bit of tissue</i>

01:12.347 --> 01:14.347
<i>to clean the gunk out of my eyes.</i>

01:14.383 --> 01:16.349
<i>You gotta buy me the expensive food,</i>

01:16.385 --> 01:17.684
<i>because it's good for my bones.</i>

01:17.719 --> 01:20.954
<i>Hell, sometimes I can't even
walk up the stairs, child.</i>

01:20.990 --> 01:24.789

- <i>But Sam, she saw something in me.</i>

01:24.906 --> 01:25.938
<i>We clicked.</i>

01:26.008 --> 01:27.674
You know, when a dog feels

01:27.709 --> 01:30.757
that bond in a human, it feels good.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.940
We feel it in our whole body.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.115
Now sure, we may not
be as smarts as you,

01:36.150 --> 01:39.384
but we feel just as much...

01:39.419 --> 01:41.718
happiness, curiosity,

01:41.989 --> 01:45.457
fear, love, joy.

01:45.921 --> 01:47.390
(sniffles) Yeah.

01:47.761 --> 01:48.882
I'm gonna miss her.

01:49.295 --> 01:50.795
(crying) Just gimme a second.

01:50.906 --> 01:52.453
(sniffling) I'm all right.

01:58.805 --> 02:00.271

- Fucking blew it.

02:00.306 --> 02:01.178
<i>♪ And drink you say? ♪</i>

02:01.203 --> 02:03.040
Fucking blew it, Philly.
They were all right.

02:03.075 --> 02:04.921
I'm a goddamn loser.

02:05.882 --> 02:07.510
And fucking Principal Leif...

02:07.546 --> 02:09.038
fucking Principal Little Dick!

02:09.140 --> 02:10.741
Fail me outta senior year?

02:10.776 --> 02:13.176
I'll fail you outta senior year.

02:13.212 --> 02:15.078
- (shouts) Ohh!
- Whoa! Hello!

02:15.114 --> 02:16.580
- What up, dude?
- Jesus Christ!

02:16.616 --> 02:19.749
- Fucking senior year over! (laughs)
- (laughs) I know, yeah.

02:19.784 --> 02:21.384
This is just like <i>American Pie,</i> right?

02:21.419 --> 02:24.521
- Yeah! Mikey, I'm gonna fuck your mom.
- (both laugh)

02:24.556 --> 02:25.846
Well... all right. I wouldn't do that.

02:25.870 --> 02:27.768
- I'm sorry, man.
- All right, come on. Get your cap on.

02:27.792 --> 02:30.304
What are you doing? We're gonna be late.
No, just gimme a second.

02:30.328 --> 02:31.706
- (coughs, sniffles)
- What, are you crying?

02:31.730 --> 02:35.532
No, I'm not. I'm just like... it's
a... it's a big day, you know?

02:35.820 --> 02:38.567
Hey, bud, don't cry because it's over.

02:38.632 --> 02:41.503
Smile because it happened.
You know? (burps)

02:41.539 --> 02:43.505
Like what girls say. Like
what girls say, yeah.

02:43.541 --> 02:45.874
Plus we're going to college, dude.
(chuckles)

02:45.910 --> 02:47.876
Animation school in California?

02:47.912 --> 02:49.656
- Are you kidding me, dude?
- (sobbing) I know!

02:49.680 --> 02:52.681
Plus, I hear they hand out condoms
as soon as you walk into the dorm.

02:52.716 --> 02:53.859
- They give you condoms?
- Yes.

02:53.883 --> 02:55.100
- For sex?
- Exactly.

02:55.125 --> 02:57.123
- That's so cool.
- It's fucking sick.

02:57.148 --> 02:58.827
- Can I say something real quick?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:58.851 --> 03:00.866
- I don't have a dad. You know that.
- I'm very familiar.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.857
As soon as you sat down
and you said, "Hey, bud."

03:02.892 --> 03:05.140
I was like, "Woop!
You're my best friend."

03:05.570 --> 03:07.326
I'm... I am honored to be your dad.

03:07.351 --> 03:08.874
- You're not my dad, okay? See
- What are you talking...

03:08.898 --> 03:10.975
- No, I was opening up a little bit.
- You just said I was your dad.

03:10.999 --> 03:12.199
Now you're making a joke out of it.

03:12.223 --> 03:13.709
- You wanna go play catch?
- Fuck off.

03:13.734 --> 03:15.013
Let's fucking do it! Let's graduate!

03:15.037 --> 03:17.048
- Can't wait to get out of this dump.
- (chuckles nervously)

03:17.072 --> 03:18.805
Totally, man. High school sucks.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.171
College is gonna be so cool.

03:21.757 --> 03:23.061
All right, boys, come on, big smile.

03:23.085 --> 03:24.431
Okay, we're gonna start with my camera,

03:24.443 --> 03:25.557
and then Mr. Luciano's camera.

03:25.581 --> 03:28.685
- Come on, let me get my arm around ya.
- Mom: Big smiles, guys.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.435
- Is that a gang sign?
- No, Mom.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.349
- (whispers) Rad boys for life, dude.
- Yeah.

03:31.385 --> 03:33.986
- Here we go. One, two...
- (camera clicks)

03:34.021 --> 03:36.351
- So proud.
- So proud. So happy.

03:36.726 --> 03:37.506
Hey, bud.

03:37.531 --> 03:38.827
What's up? We should
probably get going.

03:38.851 --> 03:42.427
No, I just... I want to tell
you I'm so proud of you.

03:42.463 --> 03:45.396
I know school wasn't always for you...

03:45.431 --> 03:47.298
- Yeah. (chuckles)
- ...but you did it.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.576
You are a high school graduate.

03:49.601 --> 03:50.452
Well...

03:50.477 --> 03:53.004
And I am as proud as a
mother could ever be.

03:53.039 --> 03:56.146
(crying) I'm sorry. Can you
just stop for a second?

03:56.171 --> 03:58.142
- Are you crying?
- I'm not fucking crying.

03:58.177 --> 04:00.044
I get it. I'm crying too.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.178
- (wails)
- Okay.

04:01.214 --> 04:02.512
- Is Mike here?
- Yeah, he's...

04:02.547 --> 04:04.225
- Did Mike see that?
- I saw the whole thing.

04:04.249 --> 04:05.749
- Fuck off, dude!
- Hey.

04:05.784 --> 04:08.151
I'm sorry for cursing, but I'm
just like... this is a lot.

04:08.186 --> 04:10.186
- Shake it off. Shake it off.
- Blah! (laughs)

04:10.222 --> 04:12.489
- I feel better now. Come on, Mommy.
- Let's go.

04:12.524 --> 04:13.953
- (burps)
- (classical score plays)

04:14.710 --> 04:17.367
Leif: And of course, some of
you are going off to college,

04:17.507 --> 04:20.445
others will be rooting around in
garbage for the rest of your lives,

04:20.470 --> 04:22.837
but I am proud of each
and every one of you rats.

04:22.873 --> 04:25.974
But special recognition belongs
to your class valedictorian.

04:26.009 --> 04:27.942
Please welcome Mike Luciano.

04:27.978 --> 04:29.078
(all cheering)

04:29.512 --> 04:32.613
- Oh, yay, Mike! Go, Mike!
- Fucking number one!

04:32.648 --> 04:33.835
Thank you, Principal Leif.

04:33.914 --> 04:35.983
Wow. Can you believe we did it, guys?

04:36.018 --> 04:38.518
Man. So crazy, so sick. (snaps fingers)

04:38.553 --> 04:40.820
I want to thank my parents
and parents everywhere.

04:40.856 --> 04:43.123
- (cheers, applause)
- Liz: That's my son!

04:43.158 --> 04:44.892
Honestly, we do it all for you,

04:44.927 --> 04:46.059
to make you proud.

04:46.125 --> 04:49.162
I also want to thank Mark and
Jay, my lacrosse co-captains.

04:49.198 --> 04:52.570
(laughs) Yeah!<i> La Pura Vida!</i>

04:52.730 --> 04:54.495
(laughs, coughs)

04:54.602 --> 04:57.503
But, most of all, I want to
thank my best friend, Phil.

04:57.528 --> 04:58.470
What?

04:58.506 --> 05:00.150
- (whispers) Dude, Mike, shh!
- Liz: All right, Phil!

05:00.174 --> 05:01.485
- Nino: Yeah, Phil!
- Mom: I love you, Phil!

05:01.509 --> 05:02.953
(whispers) Mike,
shut the fuck up, dude.

05:02.977 --> 05:05.111
Sure, I'm valedictorian,
and he barely passed,

05:05.157 --> 05:07.490
- but we're in this together.
- Shh! Wrap it up, dude.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.615
I believe it was the poet
laureate Billie Joe Armstrong

05:10.650 --> 05:12.784
who crooned,
"It's something unpredictable,

05:12.819 --> 05:15.853
yet in the end it's right,
and I hope you had the...

05:15.889 --> 05:17.989
Mr. Matarese, what are you doing here?

05:18.025 --> 05:19.457
Fuck me.

05:19.492 --> 05:21.104
- What the hell's going on here?
- Oh, wait.

05:21.128 --> 05:23.962
You didn't tell anyone?
(laughs) Oh, this is great.

05:23.997 --> 05:25.797
What? What? What did he say?

05:25.890 --> 05:28.765
Ladies and gentlemen, a good life
lesson is sitting right there.

05:29.445 --> 05:30.983
(crowd whispering)
If you don't do your homework,

05:31.007 --> 05:33.137
if you blow off all of your classes,

05:33.172 --> 05:35.539
if you refer to me
as Principal Little Dick,

05:35.574 --> 05:38.742
if you spray-paint "Principal
Little Dick" on my car,

05:38.777 --> 05:40.577
if you somehow...
beyond my comprehension...

05:40.612 --> 05:43.880
legally change my name
to "Principal Little Dick,"

05:43.916 --> 05:46.182
then this is what happens... you fail.

05:46.217 --> 05:48.476
You fail senior year
and you must repeat it.

05:48.501 --> 05:49.618
Liz, what's going on?

05:49.654 --> 05:51.421
- That boy, Phil Matarese...
- (crowd gasps)

05:51.456 --> 05:52.475
...is a failure.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.590
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Phil didn't graduate?

05:54.625 --> 05:57.750
He shouldn't even be here.
Security, escort him out,

05:57.835 --> 05:59.728
and don't spare the Tazer.

06:00.179 --> 06:04.539
Um, I just wanna say that,
Principal Leif...

06:04.890 --> 06:07.535
(shouts) You suck! Fuck you, dude!

06:07.571 --> 06:09.625
- (laughs)
- (male coughs)

06:09.650 --> 06:11.773
Wait. Come on. No one's
laughing at that?

06:11.808 --> 06:12.843
- (crowd murmuring)
- Fuck.

06:12.867 --> 06:15.125
Mom: Oh, Phil, how
could you not tell me?

06:15.512 --> 06:17.984
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mommy.

06:18.063 --> 06:19.093
(burps)

06:21.406 --> 06:22.761
Leif: Did he just call his mom "Mommy"?

06:22.785 --> 06:24.986
- (laughter)
- Leif: You guys hear that?

06:25.021 --> 06:26.887
- Male: Woo!
- Leif: All right, anyway,

06:26.922 --> 06:28.489
let's get these diplomas handed out

06:28.524 --> 06:31.658
and send these kids to their
bright, promising futures.

06:31.694 --> 06:33.594
- (cheering)
- Leif: Yeah-ha!

06:33.629 --> 06:35.195
(ominous music plays)

06:35.230 --> 06:36.539
(men grunt, shout)

06:40.268 --> 06:41.268
(beeping)

06:42.137 --> 06:43.445
(indiscernible chatter)

06:44.072 --> 06:45.742
(shouting orders indiscernibly)

06:48.985 --> 06:50.148
(beeping)

06:51.613 --> 06:53.828
(shouts orders indiscernibly, grunts)

06:53.956 --> 06:55.484
- (hums)
- (gasps)

06:56.083 --> 06:57.265
(shouts indiscernibly)

06:57.918 --> 06:59.451
- (hissing)
- (men screaming)

06:59.487 --> 07:00.554
(doors rattling)

07:01.855 --> 07:03.015
(gasps) (beeping)

07:04.625 --> 07:05.656
(gasps, shouts)

07:05.757 --> 07:06.906
(man shouts orders)

07:08.762 --> 07:10.328
- (men yelp)
- (whirs, thuds)

07:10.363 --> 07:11.398
(clanging)

07:12.632 --> 07:13.937
(grunts, shouts)

07:15.714 --> 07:16.980
(hums)

07:18.008 --> 07:19.308
(gunshot)

07:23.076 --> 07:24.546
- (mumbles)
- (gun cocks)

07:32.051 --> 07:34.851
Hello again. I want to
introduce you to somebody,

07:34.886 --> 07:38.088
a good friend of mine,
perhaps my best friend.

07:38.990 --> 07:40.148
(mumbles)

07:41.026 --> 07:42.648
(spits, chuckles) I'm sorry.

07:42.928 --> 07:45.861
This is Murphy the duck.
Say hello, Murphy.

07:45.896 --> 07:47.941
(deep voice) Hello, my name
is Murphy, and I'm a duck.

07:47.965 --> 07:49.998
I like to fly and swim and poop on cars.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.146
(normal voice) Murphy, do you
mind that I chew you up?

07:52.170 --> 07:54.970
(deep voice) No, no. If it makes
you happy, it makes me happy.

07:55.005 --> 07:57.173
And also, I have
a little squeaker inside me

07:57.208 --> 07:59.375
that mimics the sound
of an animal dying.

07:59.410 --> 08:02.677
It's in your nature
to want to destroy me!

08:02.712 --> 08:04.612
(normal voice)
Murphy, may I hear the squeak?

08:04.647 --> 08:07.982
- (squeaks)
- Very good, Murphy! Oh, that was good!

08:08.017 --> 08:10.485
You know I love you,
right, Murphy. You know that.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.851
(deep voice) And I love you too.

08:12.203 --> 08:14.089
- (normal voice, growls) Mmm.
- (squeaking)

08:14.124 --> 08:15.223
(thuds)

08:15.258 --> 08:18.335
You know, they say that
animals can sense things...

08:18.515 --> 08:21.428
you know, thunderstorms
or when someone is sick.

08:21.464 --> 08:24.890
We seem to be able to tap
into an unseen plane of reality.

08:25.304 --> 08:28.034
A peephole into eternity of sorts.

08:28.070 --> 08:30.164
A glimpse into the hereafter.

08:31.474 --> 08:32.842
It's true what they say, though.

08:33.230 --> 08:35.096
All dogs do go to heaven.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.414
But not all men.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.967
Some are just born to be bad,

08:40.001 --> 08:42.635
angry that they're not God.

08:42.828 --> 08:44.126
(sniffs)

08:44.319 --> 08:46.385
Tsk. I feel something coming.

08:46.421 --> 08:48.515
Something really bad.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.055
(farts)

08:50.091 --> 08:51.756
That wasn't what I was talking about.

08:51.791 --> 08:54.826
I mean something in
addition to that is coming.

08:54.861 --> 08:57.843
Something else really bad. Not that.

08:58.165 --> 08:59.445
(rock music playing)

09:01.034 --> 09:03.401
Woman: <i>Could you turn the track up?</i>

09:03.437 --> 09:05.421
- (subway car rattles)
- (rats laughing)

09:05.839 --> 09:08.772
Mom: But, you know, I think
another year could do him good.

09:08.843 --> 09:09.484
Yeah.

09:09.509 --> 09:11.408
Not everyone is ready
for college right away.

09:11.444 --> 09:13.555
I tell you, it's that Principal
Leif, that son of a bitch.

09:13.579 --> 09:15.429
- He always had it in for Phil.
- He did. He did.

09:15.453 --> 09:17.781
Really. Yes. I agree. Leif
has always been a dipshit.

09:17.816 --> 09:19.082
- What a dick.
- What a jerk.

09:19.118 --> 09:21.818
Thank you for the invitation.
It's a really incredible party.

09:21.854 --> 09:23.887
- Delicious summer salad.
- You're welcome.

09:26.695 --> 09:28.625
Hey, honey. Hi, Mommy.

09:28.660 --> 09:30.092
Come back and join the party.

09:30.128 --> 09:31.994
- No.
- Come on, there's cheese puffs.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.063
Can you get me a plate of baby carrots?

09:34.098 --> 09:36.199
You can come get your own
plate of baby carrots.

09:36.234 --> 09:39.269
It's just embarrassing
that I'm at my graduation party

09:39.304 --> 09:41.937
and I didn't graduate,
'cause I'm a fucking idiot.

09:41.973 --> 09:44.005
- You're not an idiot.
- I am an idiot.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.475
I flunked out of senior year
of fucking high school,

09:46.510 --> 09:49.511
and now I am able to just
cry freely into this pool.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.380
- Water to water.
- Okay, honey. I love you.

09:51.415 --> 09:53.615
I mean, I'm terribly
disappointed, but I love you.

09:53.651 --> 09:55.784
Yeah, no, that's the
general theme of the day.

09:56.437 --> 09:58.453
(clears throat) Hello, how do you do?

09:58.489 --> 10:01.189
I'm so glad to see you... buttfucker.

10:01.224 --> 10:04.024
There's my little Mikey.
Hey, boy, come here!

10:04.060 --> 10:05.871
- Hey, Auntie May, how's it going?
- Aw, I love you.

10:05.895 --> 10:07.228
- Gimme some sugar.
- Both: Mwah.

10:07.263 --> 10:09.161
I flew all the way from South Jersey

10:09.173 --> 10:11.031
to have my goddamn picture taken.

10:11.067 --> 10:12.600
- (both laugh)
- (smacks)

10:12.635 --> 10:13.879
All right. So, your friend the idiot,

10:13.903 --> 10:16.070
he won't be going with you
to California, I'd imagine.

10:16.105 --> 10:18.938
Uh, Phil? I mean,
he's not really an idiot.

10:18.973 --> 10:20.751
- No, he's just kinda...
- Oh, well, that's your opinion.

10:20.775 --> 10:22.475
Well, I mean, he doesn't
have a dad, so...

10:22.511 --> 10:24.758
- Yeah, so? I don't either.
- All right. I guess...

10:24.783 --> 10:26.846
Look, come here. I wanna
give you some advice.

10:26.881 --> 10:28.281
Oh. Okay. I'm serious about this.

10:28.317 --> 10:30.817
You're a smart boy,
and you'll do great things.

10:30.852 --> 10:32.819
Don't let that homo hold you back.

10:32.854 --> 10:34.364
- Wow.
- You're gay with him, aren't you?

10:34.388 --> 10:36.822
What? No, I'm not gay with Phil, okay?

10:36.857 --> 10:39.091
In fact, I actually crush pussy, so...

10:39.126 --> 10:41.126
- Oh, you're a little bitch, Mike.
- What?

10:41.161 --> 10:43.795
- I said, "You're a little bitch, Mike."
- Fuck you, Auntie May.

10:43.831 --> 10:45.464
Fuck me? Well, that would be incest,

10:45.491 --> 10:48.192
although I've always said,
"Incest is relative."

10:48.236 --> 10:50.881
- (laughs)
- Ugh! You've always said that? Why?

10:50.906 --> 10:52.592
I didn't ask you to come here, okay?

10:52.617 --> 10:53.547
My mom asked you to come here!

10:53.572 --> 10:54.983
I think you fucking did
ask me to come here.

10:55.007 --> 10:55.940
Why would I ask for my...

10:55.965 --> 10:57.520
Because you've always
had a crush on me.

10:57.544 --> 11:00.562
Everyone knows it. All of South
Jersey knows it! (rats gasp)

11:01.210 --> 11:02.577
- (sips)
- Great seeing you, Auntie May.

11:02.601 --> 11:04.937
Well, it wasn't great seeing
you, you little twerp.

11:05.296 --> 11:07.261
Woo! I'm fucking wasted.

11:07.992 --> 11:10.254
Aren't you the cutest little thing?

11:10.289 --> 11:11.390
You're not my type.

11:11.992 --> 11:13.590
- (sighs)
- Mike: Hey, man.

11:13.626 --> 11:16.293
- Oh, hey.
- I heard you wanted some baby carrots.

11:16.328 --> 11:18.976
Oh, thank you for the carrots
and the paper plate.

11:19.117 --> 11:20.762
I love baby carrots. Did you know

11:20.774 --> 11:22.733
they're just big carrots shaved down?

11:22.768 --> 11:24.467
- They're not actually small carrots.
- Really?

11:24.485 --> 11:25.056
Yeah.

11:25.081 --> 11:26.780
I thought they grew little
carrots and then grew...

11:26.804 --> 11:30.139
No, it's ugly carrots that
they can't sell in the stores,

11:30.242 --> 11:32.286
'cause people, you know,
they like visual aesthetics.

11:32.310 --> 11:34.377
They shave them down into baby carrots.

11:34.412 --> 11:36.570
- Wow.
- Yeah, but anyway,

11:37.114 --> 11:39.214
listen, I'm sorry about earlier today.

11:39.250 --> 11:42.049
Oh. Like lying about not
graduating high school.

11:42.085 --> 11:43.296
Don't worry about it. I mean, it blows.

11:43.320 --> 11:46.721
It fucking blows, dude. I
mean, here's the good news.

11:46.757 --> 11:48.290
We'll still be able to stay in touch,

11:48.325 --> 11:50.392
You know, it'll be like I
never left, basically.

11:50.427 --> 11:51.859
Wait. What are you talking about?

11:51.895 --> 11:54.829
I'm just saying when I'm in
California, it's like with Facebook

11:54.864 --> 11:56.376
- and with...
- You're still going to California?

11:56.400 --> 11:58.266
(chuckles) Of course I'm still going.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.066
It was my idea to go
to the animation school,

12:00.102 --> 12:01.446
and you're gonna go without me?
I showed you that.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.686
What do you want, me to stay back

12:02.698 --> 12:04.149
here and repeat senior year with you?

12:04.173 --> 12:06.674
No, dude, but we were gonna be
a team on this cartoon, man.

12:06.709 --> 12:09.176
You didn't get your shit together.
What do you want me to say?

12:09.211 --> 12:10.656
- I didn't get my shit together?
- It's not my...

12:10.680 --> 12:11.923
I also don't have
a fucking dad, okay, dude?

12:11.947 --> 12:13.500
So I'm dealing with a
little bit less...

12:13.524 --> 12:14.181
Fucking dad shit.

12:14.216 --> 12:16.549
...of a stacked deck
than you are, all right, buddy?

12:16.584 --> 12:18.729
Well, that doesn't mean that
I should nix my dreams to...

12:18.753 --> 12:21.654
It's our fucking dream!
In the 311 of this scenario,

12:21.690 --> 12:23.290
I'm Nick Hexum,
and you're S.A. Martinez,

12:23.325 --> 12:25.034
and that's not a bad
thing, but you just

12:25.046 --> 12:26.726
can't exist without Nick Hexum. Got it?

12:26.761 --> 12:29.462
As per usual, you're making
everything about yourself

12:29.497 --> 12:31.597
and 311, which is its own thing.

12:31.633 --> 12:33.343
- You're fired.
- (chuckles) I'm sorry. What?

12:33.367 --> 12:35.207
- You're fucking fired.
- You're fucking fired!

12:35.235 --> 12:37.902
- You're fired from my life!
- You're fucking fired from my life!

12:37.927 --> 12:39.694
- You're fired. You're fired.
- You're fired.

12:39.740 --> 12:41.673
Fuck this, dude.
I'm quitting the Phil show.

12:41.709 --> 12:45.095
I'll do my own shit.
(chuckles) Oh, and guess what.

12:45.282 --> 12:48.580
- What?
- 311's not even that good.

12:48.615 --> 12:51.682
- What'd you say?
- 311, the band that you so subscribed

12:51.718 --> 12:53.851
your entire life to
isn't even that fucking good.

12:53.886 --> 12:57.221
Sure, the one album, the self-titled
is great. I love it, of course,

12:57.256 --> 12:58.485
- but...
- (grunts)

12:59.017 --> 13:01.124
There's a line. There's a fucking line

13:01.160 --> 13:02.705
and you fucking crossed it
and you know it.

13:02.729 --> 13:05.363
- Did you really just do that?
- You were outta line.

13:05.398 --> 13:06.650
(sputtering)

13:09.067 --> 13:11.534
- You gonna fucking drown me?
- (shouts)

13:11.570 --> 13:14.036
I called it! They're gays together!

13:14.181 --> 13:18.241
I don't have a problem with it.
In fact, I'm sort of a gay icon.

13:18.276 --> 13:20.176
It's a beautiful thing.

13:20.211 --> 13:22.679
Shame on you for thinking otherwise!

13:22.714 --> 13:25.126
- (both grunting)
- Hey, boys!

13:25.416 --> 13:28.717
Knock it off! You boys
are best friends! Stop it!

13:28.753 --> 13:30.352
Get the fuck off me, Mike!

13:30.798 --> 13:32.688
Have fun in California,
you piece of shit.

13:32.723 --> 13:34.134
Yeah, I fucking will!

13:34.425 --> 13:37.426
You see that pussy sucker
punch me, Cool Uncle Jeff?

13:37.634 --> 13:39.261
- (munches)
- So cool.

13:44.869 --> 13:46.359
(howling)

13:48.271 --> 13:51.353
(giggles) Sometimes I
just like to be silly.

13:51.741 --> 13:55.142
Well, our time here is almost done.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.445
I'd like to leave you
with some parting thoughts.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.913
(footsteps)

13:59.948 --> 14:01.882
<i>We all want love.</i>

14:02.851 --> 14:04.984
- <i>To be loved.</i>
- (clinks)

14:05.020 --> 14:07.120
- <i>To give love.</i>
- (zaps)

14:07.155 --> 14:08.618
<i>To pet dogs.</i>

14:09.224 --> 14:11.259
<i>To make our parents proud.</i>

14:11.284 --> 14:12.926
<i>To make our children happy.</i>

14:12.961 --> 14:15.327
<i>To make the world a better place</i>

14:15.362 --> 14:17.195
<i>for our brothers and sisters</i>

14:17.231 --> 14:19.231
- <i>to live with compassion</i>
- (thuds)

14:19.266 --> 14:21.133
<i>and without fear.</i>

14:21.168 --> 14:22.902
<i>To live brave.</i>

14:22.937 --> 14:24.503
- (door slams)
- (gun cocks)

14:29.209 --> 14:30.676
You know what? Fuck you, Mike!

14:30.711 --> 14:32.376
And fuck you, Principal Little Dick!

14:32.412 --> 14:34.779
And fuck school, fuck graduation, dude,

14:34.815 --> 14:37.649
and fu... fucking... fuck 311, man.

14:37.684 --> 14:40.785
- Just fuck everything, dude.
- Psst!

14:40.821 --> 14:43.287
- Huh?
- Hey, Phil, it's me, Nick Hexum,

14:43.323 --> 14:45.189
from your favorite band, 311.

14:45.492 --> 14:48.292
(gasps, whispers) Nick H-E-X-U-M.

14:48.328 --> 14:51.428
Yup, that's me. Hey, Phil,
what's your favorite 311 album?

14:51.464 --> 14:53.296
Oh, shit, dude. Putting me on the spot.

14:53.332 --> 14:55.209
Well, I'd have to say it's
a tie between <i> Grassroots,</i>

14:55.233 --> 14:57.768
<i>311, Music, Transistor, and Soundsystem.</i>
(chuckles) Equal.

14:57.803 --> 14:59.625
Oh, snap! No new stuff?

14:59.650 --> 15:02.172
Oh my God, it's S.A. Martinez!

15:02.207 --> 15:03.919
But it's not like that, dude.
I like all your stuff.

15:03.943 --> 15:06.153
It's okay. It's all right. I'm
just playing, man. We're cool.

15:06.177 --> 15:07.023
(laughs)

15:07.048 --> 15:08.989
So, Phil, do you remember
a song off <i> Soundsystem</i>

15:09.013 --> 15:10.112
called "Life's Not a Race"?

15:10.147 --> 15:11.681
♪ So hard to believe ♪

15:11.716 --> 15:13.661
- Yeah, exactly. No, do you ever...
- ♪ Part of me will fade ♪

15:13.685 --> 15:15.518
♪ In the mystery, in a future world ♪

15:15.553 --> 15:16.764
- He gonna do the whole song?
- ♪ Long ago ♪

15:16.788 --> 15:18.921
♪ Part feels for your love
and lives to tell you so ♪

15:18.957 --> 15:20.289
Wow, he's really going for it.

15:20.324 --> 15:22.569
- We get it. We know the song.
- ♪ You can't stop entropy ♪

15:22.593 --> 15:25.326
- ♪ So why even try? ♪
- Okay, okay, stop right there.

15:25.362 --> 15:27.629
"You can't stop entropy,
so why even try?"

15:27.664 --> 15:28.984
Do you know what I meant by that?

15:29.220 --> 15:33.001
Yeah! It's like life
is like... it's a spiral

15:33.036 --> 15:36.237
and it's also kind of
a staircase to heaven.

15:36.272 --> 15:38.406
- Mmm, not quite. (whispers)
- Nick, I don't think

15:38.441 --> 15:39.840
he knows what "entropy" means, man.

15:39.852 --> 15:41.186
Do you know what entropy means?

15:41.210 --> 15:42.988
What is this, fucking
English class or something?

15:43.012 --> 15:44.612
Get off my back. Jesus Christ.

15:44.647 --> 15:47.180
See, Phil, entropy stems
from thermodynamics.

15:47.216 --> 15:49.449
It's a theory that all things
have a gradual

15:49.485 --> 15:51.619
but inevitable decline into disorder,

15:51.654 --> 15:54.788
decomposition, collapse,
et cetera, et cetera.

15:54.824 --> 15:56.823
(whispers) Wait a minute. <i>From Chaos.</i>

15:56.858 --> 15:58.858
That's exactly right. <i>From Chaos.</i>

15:58.894 --> 16:01.260
And if you actually
listened to that album,

16:01.295 --> 16:03.963
you'd hear me say,
"From chaos comes clarity."

16:03.999 --> 16:06.082
See, Phil, you're only given a limited

16:06.094 --> 16:08.134
time on this wild ride called life,

16:08.212 --> 16:10.837
and while we sometimes can't
control the things around us,

16:10.872 --> 16:12.672
we can make the most of our time here.

16:12.707 --> 16:15.407
So, maybe if you spent
more time actually drawing

16:15.442 --> 16:17.743
and honing your craft
instead of jerking off,

16:17.778 --> 16:19.188
you might not have
flunked out of school.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.867
You could've gotten
that art scholarship

16:20.879 --> 16:22.180
that you secretly wanted, Phil.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.650
And as for Mike,
he believes in you, dude.

16:24.685 --> 16:26.311
You're a fucking asshole, and he

16:26.323 --> 16:28.319
remained your friend this whole time.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.085
Mm-hmm.

16:29.110 --> 16:30.955
I mean, me and S.A.
fight every now and then,

16:30.990 --> 16:33.691
- but it's all good. It's only natural.
- Fuck you.

16:34.212 --> 16:35.893
- Just kidding.
- Oh. Okay.

16:39.355 --> 16:40.540
(grunts)

16:42.501 --> 16:44.431
- (knocks)
- Oh, hey, Dad.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.259
All right, I'll meet you outside.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.923
(chuckles) Wow. That
was a great episode...

16:59.675 --> 17:00.767
by Phil and Mike.

17:01.355 --> 17:03.823
What am I do... I'm a fucking asshole.

17:04.021 --> 17:05.988
What time is it? I can still catch him.

17:06.022 --> 17:08.390
- 311, thank you so much.
- We're here to help, man.

17:08.425 --> 17:10.925
I love you guys so much. I
listen to you guys every day.

Don't let negativity, ego, money,

17:46.528 --> 17:48.862
or accolades guide your life.

17:48.897 --> 17:52.198
Love your neighbor.

17:57.030 --> 18:00.400
entropy will win out in the end.

18:02.338 --> 18:04.415
