WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:04.239
Michael asked me
to marry him.

00:04.399 --> 00:05.638
I'm engaged!

00:07.106 --> 00:08.039
Can I be your best man?

00:08.106 --> 00:09.858
You know I love you,
but...

00:10.093 --> 00:12.778
the best man is going to be...

00:13.976 --> 00:18.413
5.04 - Country Weekend

00:18.685 --> 00:20.653
Non-existent.

00:20.787 --> 00:21.520
Yeah.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.288
We're just doing, like,
a casual thing with friends.

00:23.323 --> 00:25.349
That way,
everybody has a nice time.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.278
Just doing
a last-minute spruce up

00:29.389 --> 00:31.714
before the guests arrive
for the weekend.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.165
Oh, Betty.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.216
You've always cared
for my family's country home

00:35.289 --> 00:36.668
as if it's your job.

00:36.703 --> 00:37.737
It is my job.

00:39.138 --> 00:41.039
Oh, hi!

00:41.107 --> 00:43.175
- You guys drove!
- We made it here, okay?

00:43.209 --> 00:43.776
All right?

00:43.844 --> 00:46.579
Yeah, I took one wrong turn out
of 100 turns.

00:46.613 --> 00:47.145
Hey, Cat.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.614
- Tough drive?
- No!

00:48.648 --> 00:50.649
I'm not in the charity business.
Look...

00:50.684 --> 00:53.719
We either like the number or not,
or I shove it up your ass.

00:53.754 --> 00:54.420
Sorry.

00:54.454 --> 00:55.688
Things are really crazy
at Marvin's work.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.356
It was just made-up.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.724
He's been yapping
on the phone the whole time.

00:58.759 --> 00:59.558
I know, I know.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.280
I'm not talking about him
behind his back.

01:01.359 --> 01:02.983
He's standing right there.
He can hear me.

01:03.020 --> 01:04.467
Not everybody's deaf,
you know.

01:04.563 --> 01:05.998
- Hey!
- Hi.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.743
Oh, Owen and Denise.

01:07.778 --> 01:09.935
How great that
your parents' country home

01:09.969 --> 01:11.337
is in the same part of Japan

01:11.371 --> 01:12.979
as the army base
that we're living on?

01:13.014 --> 01:14.239
It's practically unbelievable.

01:14.273 --> 01:15.875
Oh, I'm just so glad
you could make it.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.244
Any chance to spend
some quality time with my hubby.

01:19.312 --> 01:21.346
Aww, you two.

01:21.381 --> 01:22.648
Oh, man.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.717
I am crazy about my wife.

01:24.784 --> 01:26.151
You are so lucky.

01:26.219 --> 01:28.821
Sherry and I haven't gotten along
since that time before we met.

01:28.855 --> 01:30.489
Oh, guys, hey!

01:30.524 --> 01:32.157
Val and Al are here!

01:32.191 --> 01:32.691
Hey!

01:32.726 --> 01:33.626
I forgot.

01:33.693 --> 01:36.294
Val is dating comedy-music legend
Weird Al Yankovic.

01:36.329 --> 01:36.896
Hi, guys.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.197
This is my boyfriend,
Weird Al Yankovic.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.366
Please,
call me Weird Al...

01:41.401 --> 01:42.367
Yankovic.

01:42.435 --> 01:45.938
Or just Weird Al Yankovic.
Whatever you're more comfortable with.

01:45.972 --> 01:49.307
Val's told me so many funny stories
about one of you.

01:52.378 --> 01:53.946
I heard you
the first time, Sherry.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.447
I'm not blind.

01:55.481 --> 01:58.477
Okay, well, you keep yelling like that,
you're gonna break something.

01:59.586 --> 02:01.586
Oh, my God.

02:06.359 --> 02:07.492
Hmm.

02:07.527 --> 02:09.360
Everyone,
I'd like to propose a toast.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.195
Aww.

02:10.229 --> 02:11.864
What part of "final offer"
don't you understand?

02:11.898 --> 02:12.698
Honey, honey.

02:12.732 --> 02:15.592
I talked to you
a few days ago about this.

02:17.837 --> 02:18.470
To Cat.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.573
- Aww.
- Powerful.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.107
You're gonna make me cry.

02:22.175 --> 02:23.308
Boo-boo...

02:23.342 --> 02:24.610
Wait, you guys.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.880
We're toasting the bride,
but we haven't even met the groom.

02:35.421 --> 02:36.388
Oh, gosh.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.202
No, Michael's on his way home
from work,

02:38.285 --> 02:41.338
and if he is running on time,
he'll be here in 60 seconds.

02:41.394 --> 02:44.930
Actually, I was gonna take
the 9:15 train out of the city,

02:45.364 --> 02:47.766
but I finished up early
and jumped on the 9:14.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.234
- Michael...
- Hi, baby.

02:49.268 --> 02:50.268
Hey.

02:50.303 --> 02:51.637
I wasn't expecting you
for another minute.

02:51.705 --> 02:52.838
Nice to meet you all.

02:52.872 --> 02:55.240
Cat's told me so many funny stories
about all but one of you.

02:55.274 --> 02:56.842
Michael's in the music business.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.677
Yeah, I'm a cashier
at Guitar Center.

02:58.712 --> 02:59.311
Ooh.

02:59.378 --> 03:01.379
He's met Alex Van Halen
twice.

03:01.414 --> 03:02.314
Second to Eddie,

03:02.348 --> 03:04.549
that is the Van Halen
you want to meet.

03:04.584 --> 03:06.719
So, this is Owen
and his wife, Denise.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.088
And Valerie and her boyfriend,
Weird Al Yankovic.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.122
Oh, hey.

03:10.156 --> 03:11.624
And that's Marvin over there.

03:11.658 --> 03:14.326
And my white housekeeper,
Betty.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.630
And, finally, my very
best friend in the world...

03:17.664 --> 03:19.264
Lola Spratt.

03:19.298 --> 03:21.133
Hi, Michael.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.468
How do you two
know each other?

03:23.503 --> 03:24.569
From Columbia.

03:24.604 --> 03:25.704
I was pre-med.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.806
And I was pre...
What was it again?

03:29.308 --> 03:30.542
Pre-what?

03:30.576 --> 03:31.276
What was it again?

03:31.310 --> 03:33.091
Cat, are you all right?

03:34.914 --> 03:36.448
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:36.482 --> 03:38.450
I have some very disturbing
news.

03:38.484 --> 03:40.585
My wife, Sherry's, been stabbed.
She's dead.

03:40.620 --> 03:41.520
Somebody call 911.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.153
My folks don't believe
in landlines,

03:43.232 --> 03:44.222
so we have to use
someone's cell.

03:44.257 --> 03:45.691
We could ask Marvin
to use his.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.592
We'll just have to wait
till he gets off.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.561
Sweetie, you used
to be a police officer.

03:49.595 --> 03:51.797
You can conduct the investigation
for the time being.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.498
- Great idea.
- Okay.

03:53.533 --> 03:54.432
She's right.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.835
Meanwhile, no one here
should worry about this.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.436
A woman has been stabbed,

03:58.471 --> 04:01.039
probably by someone
who's walking among us,

04:01.074 --> 04:02.808
but the important thing
is to focus

04:02.842 --> 04:04.643
on the beautiful wedding

04:04.678 --> 04:06.111
of Cat and Michael
taking place tomorrow.

04:06.146 --> 04:06.845
Aww...

04:06.880 --> 04:08.397
- Aww...
- Powerful.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.283
Not that I care at all,

04:11.350 --> 04:13.752
but how come you never mentioned
anything about you and Lola?

04:16.454 --> 04:18.356
What do you want me
to say?

04:18.391 --> 04:22.194
Am I supposed to report to you
every single detail of my entire life?!

04:22.228 --> 04:24.163
Okay, okay.
I'm sorry.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.131
I'm sorry.

04:26.466 --> 04:27.866
I'm gonna get a snack.
You want anything?

04:27.934 --> 04:30.335
Um...I'll take whatever's
just lying around.

04:30.369 --> 04:33.305
I mean, if there's a couscous medley,
I'll take it in a tagine.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.547
Let me guess.

04:42.582 --> 04:45.483
Peanut butter on bread.

04:46.586 --> 04:47.652
You remembered.

04:47.687 --> 04:49.518
It feels
like just yesterday...

04:49.589 --> 04:52.511
the day I met you
at that party in the 1990's.

04:57.330 --> 04:58.831
What is that awesome smell?

04:58.865 --> 05:01.166
Is that peanut butter
and bread?

05:01.201 --> 05:02.500
Not quite.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.170
Peanut butter on bread.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.539
It's kind of my specialty.

05:07.573 --> 05:08.607
Here. Try it.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.277
Okay.

05:11.711 --> 05:13.314
Mmm.

05:13.349 --> 05:14.833
It's peanut buttery,

05:14.868 --> 05:17.167
but I can definitely
taste the bread in there, too.

05:17.202 --> 05:20.418
That's exactly...
what I was going for.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.254
I'm Lola. Pre-med.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.491
Michael.

05:23.526 --> 05:26.524
Pre-ejaculate making
its way up my vas deferens.

05:27.426 --> 05:30.151
I figure since you're pre-med,
you understand what I'm saying.

05:32.298 --> 05:34.490
You know,
I still think of you fondly

05:34.525 --> 05:36.735
every time I see
or taste bread.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.371
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:39.405 --> 05:42.507
Well, we should
get some sleep, huh?

05:42.541 --> 05:43.809
Yeah.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.544
- Good night.
- Good night.

05:50.526 --> 05:51.730
Dude, you're killing me here.

05:51.765 --> 05:53.269
No, I'll call it off.
I don't care.

05:53.343 --> 05:54.395
No. You tell...

06:01.661 --> 06:03.295
Oh, I didn't see you come in.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:12.237 --> 06:14.905
Are you in the middle
of a number two right now?

06:15.808 --> 06:16.874
No.

06:16.909 --> 06:18.710
Too nervous.

06:18.744 --> 06:20.712
Good.

06:29.522 --> 06:30.888
Who are we kidding?

06:30.923 --> 06:33.377
Oh, this was bound to happen.

06:35.027 --> 06:35.893
Oh, Michael.

06:35.928 --> 06:39.498
Oh, I haven't had sex
on a toilet in months.

06:39.532 --> 06:40.599
Oh, here comes Cat.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.433
She looks so beautiful.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.128
Oh, she looks great.

06:44.163 --> 06:45.908
Oh, she went
with the white dress.

06:56.982 --> 06:58.816
I can't do this.

06:58.851 --> 07:01.085
- Michael.
- I'm so sorry, everybody.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.720
I'm sorry, Cat.
The wedding's off.

07:02.788 --> 07:04.456
Why?

07:04.490 --> 07:05.923
I can tell you why.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.492
Because his fiancÃ©e...

07:07.526 --> 07:08.460
is a murderer!

07:08.494 --> 07:10.462
What?

07:10.496 --> 07:12.539
It look a while
to put it all together,

07:12.615 --> 07:14.449
but now it makes
perfect sense.

07:14.567 --> 07:18.470
Cat hated Glenn's wife, Sherry,
from moment one.

07:18.504 --> 07:21.739
Sherry is a woman
that can't hear anything

07:21.774 --> 07:23.441
at all!

07:23.476 --> 07:26.144
Then there's the matter
of the weapon.

07:26.179 --> 07:31.149
The weapon was a stainless steel knife
purchased from where?

07:31.217 --> 07:33.779
A department store.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.121
Now, then.

07:38.691 --> 07:42.505
It gives me pause
as far as this being as...

07:42.940 --> 07:46.064
strong a case
as I'd hoped when I...

07:46.098 --> 07:49.133
heard it in my head
before I started speaking.

07:49.168 --> 07:52.143
And it is actually unlikely

07:52.262 --> 07:56.307
that Cat did this murder
at all.

07:56.342 --> 08:00.890
And now it's just anxiety
that I have as I...

08:00.972 --> 08:03.219
look around
and see everybody looking.

08:10.422 --> 08:11.423
Denise!

08:11.490 --> 08:13.891
- Marvin?!
- What? What can I say?

08:13.926 --> 08:15.493
You caught us.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.762
I'm having sex with Denise right now.
There's no denying it.

08:17.796 --> 08:19.163
So, Marvin,
were you on the phone

08:19.198 --> 08:20.665
with Denise
the whole time

08:20.700 --> 08:22.867
negotiating the terms
of your impending affair?

08:22.901 --> 08:24.669
In a nutshell, yes.
That's right.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.700
Denise, how could you?

08:26.735 --> 08:27.606
Let's face it, Owen.

08:27.640 --> 08:28.935
I want to have fun,

08:28.938 --> 08:31.256
and you always want to investigate
Sherry's murder.

08:31.291 --> 08:33.044
Of course
I had sex with Marvin.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.546
How could I not?

08:34.580 --> 08:35.447
Wait, what?

08:35.481 --> 08:37.414
Well, then I have
an announcement to make, too.

08:37.450 --> 08:38.683
Michael and I are in love.

08:38.717 --> 08:40.652
And we've decided
to be together.

08:40.686 --> 08:41.986
It's too late, Lola.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.421
I'm in love with someone else.

08:43.456 --> 08:43.988
What?

08:44.022 --> 08:46.524
It happened
when we were in the bathroom.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.159
But...

08:54.233 --> 08:56.934
I love you.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.516
I've been wanting
to quit my job,

09:04.551 --> 09:07.493
but you needed me
to be the big, fancy cashier

09:07.528 --> 09:09.252
at Guitar Center,
and, you know what?

09:09.287 --> 09:11.048
I never met Alex Van Halen.

09:11.116 --> 09:13.485
I only told you
that I met A.V.H.,

09:13.520 --> 09:16.421
'cause that's the kind of cashier
that you needed me to be.

09:16.455 --> 09:17.155
No. I...

09:17.189 --> 09:19.015
Betty's the first woman
to give me the courage

09:19.089 --> 09:20.424
to pursue my dreams.

09:20.459 --> 09:21.893
So she and I
are gonna live together.

09:21.927 --> 09:23.795
And we're both gonna work
for Weird Al Yankovic.

09:23.862 --> 09:25.397
That's right.

09:25.431 --> 09:27.476
Betty's gonna manage
my Twitter account,

09:27.511 --> 09:30.101
and Michael is gonna be
my personal cashier.

09:30.135 --> 09:31.703
Were you gonna
mention this to me?

09:31.737 --> 09:33.805
No, I wasn't.
Why?

09:33.872 --> 09:36.641
Well,
there's nothing left to say.

09:36.676 --> 09:39.744
I, uh, got a taxi waiting outside
if you want a ride.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.401
Betty, Marvin, Weird Al, Denise.

10:03.101 --> 10:05.351
Oh, Mondays, right?

10:05.386 --> 10:06.538
The weekends
are never quite long enough.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.005
Hey, that reminds me,
Glenn.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.674
About your wife's stabbing...

10:09.709 --> 10:11.443
You know,
I'm kind of stumped on this.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.645
Everybody seems to have an alibi
but you.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.480
All right, listen.
Listen to me.

10:15.514 --> 10:16.720
I did it, okay?

10:16.755 --> 10:17.898
I killed Sherry.

10:17.933 --> 10:19.984
But it was only because
I was angry at her.

10:20.018 --> 10:20.952
Oh.

10:20.986 --> 10:23.722
That's why your prints
were on the knife.

10:23.756 --> 10:24.956
You did it.

10:24.990 --> 10:26.624
That's exactly right.

10:26.659 --> 10:28.388
I just figured it out.

10:28.423 --> 10:29.594
Should we go to the cops?

10:29.662 --> 10:30.795
I'll tell you what.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.664
Just this once,

10:32.698 --> 10:34.599
I'm gonna take off
my investigator hat

10:34.633 --> 10:36.501
and I'm gonna put on
my friend hat

10:36.569 --> 10:37.902
and let you off
with a warning.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.505
Wow.

10:40.539 --> 10:42.139
- Thank you, buddy.
- I owe you.

10:42.174 --> 10:44.709
You know, you just helped me
solve the big murder case.

10:44.777 --> 10:45.710
I did.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.011
So now we're even.

10:47.045 --> 10:48.646
- Okay.
- I love you, buddy.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.520
I love you, too.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.027
Has anyone ever told you

11:03.061 --> 11:05.730
that you look like
an older Weird Al Yankovic?

11:06.837 --> 11:07.578
Yeah.

11:14.305 --> 11:20.897
