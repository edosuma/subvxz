Basically,
it was like a huge

07:51.340 --> 07:52.510
Something exciting.

07:52.550 --> 07:53.890
Right.
Listen.

07:53.930 --> 07:55.300
Keep an eye on this address.

07:56.470 --> 07:58.220
Oh, my.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.270
A lot of lines.

07:59.310 --> 08:00.270
You're a trustworthy person.

08:01.270 --> 08:03.400
A lot of burden.
And... some love.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.400
Yes A love.
Used to be more.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.940
Pity it won't work out,
though.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.900
Leslie.
Hi.

08:11.950 --> 08:12.860
Hello.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.070
Hope I'm not
interrupting?

08:14.110 --> 08:15.030
No, no, no.

08:15.070 --> 08:15.950
She was just--

08:17.780 --> 08:19.790
She was reading my future.

08:19.830 --> 08:21.620
Well, maybe she can
tell me the exact day

08:21.660 --> 08:22.750
you're gonna get me fired.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.830
Helps to be prepared.

08:27.130 --> 08:29.750
Find him.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.970
Okay. But I have no
idea who him is.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.180
Whatever.
It's just--

08:34.220 --> 08:36.390
ahem, a client.

08:36.430 --> 08:37.640
[phone buzzes]

08:37.680 --> 08:38.560
Gotcha.

08:39.510 --> 08:41.020
And the reporter downstairs?

08:41.930 --> 08:43.140
Oh.
She's just a massive,

08:43.190 --> 08:44.140
[phone buzzes]

08:44.190 --> 08:46.270
massive pain in --

08:46.310 --> 08:49.530
You know, it's just...
It's not here.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.610
What's not?

08:50.650 --> 08:53.650
There's a file
that I'm looking for.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.570
About a case.
You know.

08:55.610 --> 08:57.870
Dad's gone around the bay.
So I'm here.

08:57.910 --> 08:59.910
And I gotta mind the shop.
You know how it goes.

08:59.950 --> 09:01.830
I just --

09:01.870 --> 09:03.460
I'm sorry about earlier.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.710
That's okay.
What's that saying?

09:04.750 --> 09:06.460
Let's just kiss and make out?

09:06.500 --> 09:07.590
What do you think?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.170
Huh?

09:09.210 --> 09:11.130
[phone rings]

09:11.170 --> 09:12.630
Mmmm.

09:12.670 --> 09:14.590
Uh...
Sorry.

09:14.630 --> 09:16.840
It's okay.
Why don't I answer it?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.430
I could be your secretary
for the day.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.930
Now that's an idea
I could get behind.

09:21.470 --> 09:22.310
Literally.

09:23.140 --> 09:24.180
But no.
You know what?

09:24.230 --> 09:25.980
I should probably --
Hold please.

09:26.020 --> 09:27.400
Probably just--
hold --

09:27.440 --> 09:29.360
I should take
this call myself.

09:29.400 --> 09:33.320
Because it's a case
that Dad is kinda worried about.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.780
Your father is worried about?

09:34.820 --> 09:36.360
What?
Yeah.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.160
Okay.
You're working.

09:38.700 --> 09:39.620
I should go.

09:39.660 --> 09:40.580
[phone buzzes]

09:40.620 --> 09:42.240
Later?

09:42.290 --> 09:43.750
You know what?
Let's just make later now?

09:43.790 --> 09:44.750
You know?

09:44.790 --> 09:47.750
[ring]

09:47.790 --> 09:50.670
I'm sorry.

09:50.710 --> 09:52.750
It's okay.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.340
-Later.
-Later.

09:54.380 --> 09:56.550
[ring]

09:57.380 --> 09:58.390
See ya.

10:00.640 --> 10:01.560
Is this you?

10:01.600 --> 10:03.680
Oh Jake.
Thank God.

10:03.720 --> 10:07.140
We got cut off.
I really need your help.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.650
Allison, are you okay?
Are you in danger?

10:08.690 --> 10:11.060
-Where are you? -Listen Jake. People --

10:11.110 --> 10:14.280
very dangerous people
are trying to kill me.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.570
What people?
What are you--

10:15.610 --> 10:17.030
Look, Dad--

10:17.070 --> 10:19.320
He was supposed to have a file
here about all of this.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.660
But it's not here.

10:20.700 --> 10:22.530
I think that
I've been drugged on something.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.790
I don't know
what is going on, Jake.

10:24.830 --> 10:26.080
Allison.
Look around.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.040
See if you can find a landmark.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.250
Try and tell me where you are.

10:30.290 --> 10:31.670
See what I'm involved in--

10:31.710 --> 10:34.130
It goes
high up the ranks.

10:34.170 --> 10:35.170
Police.

10:35.210 --> 10:37.050
Political figures.

10:37.090 --> 10:38.800
So whatever's
happened between us, Jake,

10:38.840 --> 10:40.010
I know that
you can keep me alive.

10:40.050 --> 10:41.300
[Des] Jake.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.260
What a coincidence.
Us meeting here like this.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.810
Oh, that's--

10:44.850 --> 10:46.020
I don't know
how this happened --

10:46.060 --> 10:46.980
Weird.

10:47.020 --> 10:48.190
Our outfits.

10:49.230 --> 10:50.600
Allision.
Where are you?

10:50.650 --> 10:51.900
Tell me where you are.

10:51.940 --> 10:54.780
I'm at a school near Howley.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.150
I think it's abandoned.

10:56.190 --> 10:57.150
Okay.
I'm on my way.

10:58.150 --> 10:59.820
Allison?
Jenkins?

10:59.860 --> 11:01.450
See, that's why
I don't talk to my exes.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.830
Des.
You don't have any exes.

11:03.870 --> 11:07.080
I've been known to be
a ladies' man from time to time.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.580
FYI.
Tinny's super pissed with you

11:08.620 --> 11:10.710
for beating up her super,
kidnapping, criminal dad.

11:11.330 --> 11:12.460
I got you this.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.840
Oh, and I checked out
that phone number.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.630
It belongs to a bar downtown.
A martini bar.

11:15.670 --> 11:17.710
Walter met a girl there.
She stole his files.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.380
I need you to call him. Get
her description and follow up.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.640
I'm on it.
Oh, and --

11:21.680 --> 11:22.640
I was thinking,

11:22.680 --> 11:23.890
when Mal Rose get back,

11:23.930 --> 11:24.970
Maybe we could,
you know,

11:25.010 --> 11:26.770
do our own little getaway.

11:26.810 --> 11:27.560
Just the boys.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.940
Jake.
Let's go.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.780
It's a nice look.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.080
Looks a little loose.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.160
You want me
to take it in a bit?

11:51.210 --> 11:52.580
I think it fits perfectly.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.800
-Big day coming up?
-Yeah.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.250
I can't believe
I'm gonna graduate.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.210
I thought I would have
flunked out by now.

12:00.260 --> 12:02.260
Well now you sound like
your mother's daughter.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.260
I'm a cop.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.680
A police woman.

12:06.390 --> 12:07.560
Oh, it's messed up.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.720
I'm so proud of you.

12:09.390 --> 12:10.730
You did good.

12:10.770 --> 12:12.730
Yeah. Someone needs to
tell that to uncle Jake.

12:13.810 --> 12:14.020
Tinny.

12:15.440 --> 12:18.650
He's so proud of you.
What are you talking about?

12:18.690 --> 12:20.400
Not that.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.950
He needs
to know that

12:21.990 --> 12:22.820
I know
what I'm doing.

12:23.450 --> 12:25.280
With my father.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.080
What he did
to Kevin Crocker.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.740
It seems extreme.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.000
But they have
a sordid past.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.790
Jake was --

12:32.830 --> 12:35.080
Jake was just
thinking about you.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.500
He was protecting you.

12:36.540 --> 12:37.960
If you ask me,

12:38.000 --> 12:41.720
Jake used me as an excuse
to beat the pulp out of Crocker.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.640
That's not what happened.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.640
Whatever.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.720
He's acting
like a lunatic.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.220
Like a total freak.

12:49.260 --> 12:51.180
Well you might be right.
He is a freak.

12:54.850 --> 12:57.270
Anyways.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.860
Are we gonna get on 'er
the night of my grad?

12:58.900 --> 13:00.190
Or what?

13:00.230 --> 13:02.360
Mom and daughter.
Tear up the town.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.740
Yes now.

13:12.620 --> 13:15.210
So, we're here to see
Judge Jenkins.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.920
Isn't she an ex?

13:16.960 --> 13:19.290
-Why does she live in a school?
-We dated. Yes.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.670
And obviously,
she doesn't live in a school.

13:20.710 --> 13:22.050
She's hiding here.

13:22.090 --> 13:24.340
Hiding exes.
Man your closet is deep.

13:24.380 --> 13:25.680
You're like
a reporter's dream.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.890
[phone buzzes]

13:28.930 --> 13:30.060
Honest to God.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.310
I'm gonna throw this thing
into the harbor.

13:31.350 --> 13:32.850
What? What? What? What?

13:32.890 --> 13:34.180
Where are you Jake?

13:34.230 --> 13:35.890
I'm looking for your--
you know,

13:35.940 --> 13:37.600
files
and stuff.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.610
Good.
And Jake.

13:39.650 --> 13:42.780
Do not leave this with Des,
alright?

13:42.820 --> 13:44.240
-This is important. -Walter.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.110
Please. Okay,
I'm doing my best today.

13:46.150 --> 13:47.660
I'm just --

13:47.700 --> 13:49.160
Give me a break.
Alright?

13:49.200 --> 13:50.120
[beep]

13:50.160 --> 13:51.450
You need a hug.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.120
I need a what?

13:55.160 --> 13:56.160
Jake.
There isn't a moment

13:56.210 --> 13:57.420
where someone isn't
pissed at you,

13:57.460 --> 14:00.210
punching you,
or just plain wants to kill you.

14:00.250 --> 14:02.550
You're overworked.
And you're tired.

14:02.590 --> 14:03.880
So you--

14:03.920 --> 14:06.300
need a hug.

14:06.340 --> 14:07.470
I don't think
that's a good idea.

14:07.510 --> 14:08.760
Come on.
Bring it in.

14:19.230 --> 14:20.150
Listen.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.400
It's just a hug.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.530
That look odd to you?

14:30.570 --> 14:31.580
Yup.

14:33.410 --> 14:35.080
Alright.
Let's get inside.

14:42.210 --> 14:43.460
[bang]

14:46.010 --> 14:46.920
Alright.

14:54.390 --> 14:55.850
[Kyla] Are you sure this
is the right place?

14:55.890 --> 14:57.350
Shhh.
Jenkins.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.070
Oh thank God.
Jake.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.030
-Who's she?
-I'm Kyla. I'm a reporter.

15:08.150 --> 15:09.780
A reporter?
You brought a reporter?

15:09.820 --> 15:10.860
Yeah. Ignore her.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.160
Just give me the gun, okay?
please?

15:14.240 --> 15:15.990
Allison?
Are you okay?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.000
Not really.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.620
It's nice to see you
though, again.

15:19.660 --> 15:21.000
Despite the circumstances.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.630
Yeah, it's nice
to see you too.

15:22.670 --> 15:24.420
You look good
as a blonde.

15:24.460 --> 15:26.420
[Kyla]
Do you two need a minute?

15:26.460 --> 15:27.550
You wanna explain to me

15:27.590 --> 15:29.800
exactly what the hell
is going on here?

15:31.630 --> 15:33.930
People are trying
to kill me, Jake.

15:33.970 --> 15:35.510
A case that I've been
working on has got me

15:35.560 --> 15:36.850
in hot water.
And--

15:36.890 --> 15:38.730
somebody
is trying to kill me.

15:38.770 --> 15:40.390
Do you know what case,
exactly?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.480
I'm working on

15:42.520 --> 15:43.650
a murder case,

15:43.690 --> 15:45.190
an anti-trust case
against the mob,

15:45.230 --> 15:47.610
a case against a casino,

15:47.650 --> 15:49.610
a case against
a big pharmaceutical --

15:49.650 --> 15:51.450
That's a lot of powerful people
to have on the hook.

15:51.490 --> 15:54.450
A lot of powerful people who
could pay to make me disappear.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.500
Are you feeling okay?

15:58.540 --> 16:00.210
Have you been to a doctor?

16:00.250 --> 16:01.210
I don't need a doctor,
Jake.

16:01.870 --> 16:03.370
My brakes were cut.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.000
A truck tried to run me over
while I was crossing the street.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.550
And I think that I'm still
drugged on something.

16:08.590 --> 16:11.220
Yeah, that's what they call
Peach Schnapps.

16:11.260 --> 16:12.380
Are you enjoying this?

16:13.430 --> 16:15.300
Why did you bring her here?

16:15.350 --> 16:17.140
I wish
that I could explain that.

16:17.180 --> 16:18.640
The truck
that almost ran you over.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.020
Can you describe
it to me exactly?

16:20.060 --> 16:21.770
It was red.

16:21.810 --> 16:22.730
Big.

16:22.770 --> 16:24.520
It had a lot of lights.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.650
There was a truck outside about
two minutes ago

16:26.690 --> 16:29.110
that matches that description
almost exactly.

16:29.150 --> 16:31.400
And there was a weird,
creepy fella inside.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.030
Oh my God.
They found me.

16:33.070 --> 16:34.610
I am freaking out here,
Jake.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.990
[phone buzzes]

16:37.030 --> 16:38.790
Des.
Did you find her?

16:38.830 --> 16:40.080
Yeah, I think that's her.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.040
The missus that tied up Walter.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.290
I'm gonna keep my distance.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.250
For fear of capture.
And subsequent hanging.

16:44.290 --> 16:46.170
Although, I gotta be honest.
Part of me wants to be captured.

16:46.210 --> 16:47.090
Is that weird?

16:48.170 --> 16:49.250
She disappeared.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.130
Meaning you lost her?
Where are you?

16:51.170 --> 16:54.220
A small road around Newtown.

16:54.260 --> 16:55.260
[bang]

16:55.300 --> 16:56.430
Des?

16:56.470 --> 16:57.970
Des?
Is he all right?

16:58.010 --> 16:59.810
We gotta go.
Now. Now, now!

17:02.520 --> 17:03.850
Alright.
Let's go. Let's go.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.310
Get to the car.
Get to the car.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.280
[tires squeal]

17:11.320 --> 17:12.240
Run!

17:20.040 --> 17:21.660
Are you okay?

17:21.700 --> 17:23.160
I'm fine.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.460
Thank you Jake.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.130
Well, look at you two.
Flame still there, huh?

17:27.170 --> 17:28.210
-Yeah.
-No.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.130
No.

17:30.710 --> 17:32.510
Got a pic of our guy.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.010
Nice work.

17:36.050 --> 17:37.430
Thanks.

17:37.470 --> 17:40.560
So, this is the guy who's trying
to kill you, huh?

17:44.850 --> 17:46.140
Where'd she go?

17:46.190 --> 17:47.400
Oh, she's long gone.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.190
She disappeared
like vapor.

17:50.230 --> 17:52.070
Do you have any description
of what she looked like?

17:52.110 --> 17:53.280
Anything at all?

17:53.320 --> 17:57.490
It's like a blur of punches
and kicks and...

17:58.620 --> 17:59.700
And I think a head butt.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.450
Are my clothes okay?

18:01.490 --> 18:02.660
Any more details
would be great.

18:02.700 --> 18:05.330
She was hot.
And tall.

18:05.370 --> 18:08.000
And hot.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.380
And oh,
I stuck a tracker on her

18:09.420 --> 18:10.500
when she was kicking
my bum in.

18:11.460 --> 18:13.210
You could have led
with that.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.510
Do you have any way
of catching her?

18:14.550 --> 18:16.010
No. Well, kinda.
It's short range,

18:16.050 --> 18:18.090
so I'll have to
drive all around the city

18:18.130 --> 18:19.590
trying to find
exactly where she is.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.640
Come on.
We have work to do.

18:20.680 --> 18:21.600
Okay.

18:21.640 --> 18:22.560
Just --

18:22.600 --> 18:25.220
[phone buzzes]

18:25.270 --> 18:26.680
Now is not a good time,
sister.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.140
Well, we need to talk
about things.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.360
Ah, things meaning
Kevin Crocker.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.650
Because I'm not in the mood.

18:31.690 --> 18:32.360
It's about Tinny.

18:33.690 --> 18:36.240
I know. I know. I know. I know.
She's pissed.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.450
Well, just make
some time for her.

18:37.490 --> 18:39.070
That's all.
And she'll get over it.

18:39.110 --> 18:40.820
You know, Crocker--

18:40.870 --> 18:42.740
It's almost like
he wanted me to attack him.

18:42.780 --> 18:45.040
Like he was goading me on,
or something.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.450
Well, he was supposed
to be shipped out

18:46.500 --> 18:47.830
before you're little run-in.

18:47.870 --> 18:49.210
They're keeping him here?

18:49.250 --> 18:51.540
Yeah. Doctors won't let him
leave until he heals up.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.880
I'm an idiot.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.630
Anyway.
I thought you should know.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.180
Bye.

19:05.470 --> 19:08.060
Yeah. Yeah.
Thanks for that.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.890
Malachy Doyle.
We just got here.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.230
This is your aunt's
anniversary party.

19:12.270 --> 19:13.730
Who do you have to call
so badly?

19:13.770 --> 19:15.360
I'm just --

19:15.400 --> 19:16.940
I'm worried about Allison.

19:16.980 --> 19:20.990
And Jake has a tendency
to lose perspective.

19:21.030 --> 19:22.780
Oh, he's a big boy.
He can handle it.

19:22.820 --> 19:25.580
I just --
I just need to check in.

19:25.620 --> 19:26.620
Okay.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.080
[Jake] So we ran a trace on our guy.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.250
[Des]
Michael Stewart.

19:31.290 --> 19:33.380
He has a rap sheet
for numerous assaults.

19:33.420 --> 19:35.290
Do you have any idea why
this fella would be after you?

19:35.340 --> 19:37.050
[Allison] I don't know. I mean,
he doesn't look familiar.

19:37.090 --> 19:38.300
Maybe when I was
a Crown Prosecutor?

19:39.050 --> 19:40.470
He could be a hired gun.

19:40.510 --> 19:42.090
Oh, that's comforting.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.850
She had really pretty eyes.

19:43.890 --> 19:45.220
The missus who beat me.

19:47.930 --> 19:49.140
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

19:49.180 --> 19:52.190
That was inside voices
versus the other one.

19:52.230 --> 19:54.110
Do you guys find it so hard to
tell the difference sometimes?

19:54.150 --> 19:55.310
[phone buzzes]

19:55.360 --> 19:56.860
Tell me, is it that terrible
where you are

19:56.900 --> 19:58.480
that you gotta keep calling me
every two minutes, or what?

19:58.530 --> 20:00.700
[Mal] I've been thinking
about you and Allison.

20:00.740 --> 20:02.110
She's with me right now.
Speaking of --

20:02.150 --> 20:03.950
Where's that file you were
supposed to leave for me?

20:03.990 --> 20:06.200
Rose left it.
As clear as day on her desk.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.490
She did hours of work getting
her bank statements,

20:08.540 --> 20:09.830
all her finances,
everything.

20:09.870 --> 20:11.500
I'm right next to her desk.
It's not here.

20:11.540 --> 20:12.790
Well open your eyes next time.

20:12.830 --> 20:14.670
My eyes are open. It's
not here. Trust me.

20:14.710 --> 20:16.290
I don't trust you.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.750
Look--

20:17.800 --> 20:20.800
I know even you're not
stunned enough

20:20.840 --> 20:23.050
to ruin the good thing
you have with Leslie.

20:23.090 --> 20:25.090
Even if Allison
was remotely interested,

20:25.140 --> 20:26.430
which I'm sure she's not.

20:26.470 --> 20:28.010
I just have a feeling

20:28.060 --> 20:31.180
that whatever
is in play here, is big.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.390
We need to protect her.

20:33.140 --> 20:35.060
I agree with you.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.980
And I'll call you later.

20:37.020 --> 20:39.860
Right.

20:43.070 --> 20:44.740
Everything okay?

20:44.780 --> 20:45.870
Yeah, it's fine.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.700
So like,
should we even be here?

20:48.740 --> 20:50.700
Is there maybe a safer place
for Judge Jenkins?

20:50.750 --> 20:51.750
I agree with you.

20:51.790 --> 20:53.250
And I'm pretty sure
I have a plan.

20:53.290 --> 20:54.290
[buzz]

20:54.330 --> 20:55.420
[Jake]
What are you doing?

20:55.460 --> 20:57.250
[Kyla]
Say hello.

20:57.710 --> 20:58.630
Hello?

20:58.670 --> 21:00.340
Jake.
It's me.

21:00.380 --> 21:01.630
Colleen.
Colleen, Jake.

21:01.670 --> 21:02.670
The second client?

21:02.720 --> 21:04.680
Oh, Colleen. Hi.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.180
Where are you?
Are you here at the house?

21:06.220 --> 21:07.300
Or the office?

21:07.350 --> 21:08.760
I can sense
that he's coming for me.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.140
I'm at the office.

21:10.180 --> 21:12.020
And if you can sense
that someone's coming for you,

21:12.060 --> 21:13.230
I'm just gonna
throw this out there--

21:13.270 --> 21:14.350
It's probably a doctor.

21:14.390 --> 21:16.230
And they want to take you
to the hospital.

21:16.270 --> 21:17.860
No Jake.
I can sense it.

21:17.900 --> 21:20.150
Because he kidnapped me
and has me tied up.

21:20.190 --> 21:22.110
He has you tied up.
Where are you?

21:22.150 --> 21:23.070
Near Mundy Pond.

21:23.110 --> 21:24.150
Mundy Pond.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.780
Oh God!
He's coming!

21:27.450 --> 21:28.950
So, bad news.

21:28.990 --> 21:30.950
There's another crazy lady

21:30.990 --> 21:32.620
who thinks that a bunch
of people are after her.

21:32.660 --> 21:34.580
Maybe you two
should get together.

21:34.620 --> 21:37.420
Obviously I don't believe
that she's in danger.

21:37.460 --> 21:38.960
But if there's a chance
that she is --

21:39.000 --> 21:40.130
Go. Go.

21:40.170 --> 21:41.710
Des will keep me safe.

21:41.750 --> 21:43.260
He's was always the smart one,
anyway.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.760
I will?
I mean, I will.

21:45.800 --> 21:46.970
Des, I'm counting on you.

21:47.010 --> 21:48.340
Okay, I promise.
This won't take long.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.470
Oh, and the tracker
I planted on Walter's

21:49.510 --> 21:50.720
mystery lady
is set so that

21:50.760 --> 21:52.930
if it gets within fifty meters
of any of us,

21:52.970 --> 21:54.020
it will text our phones.

21:54.060 --> 21:55.390
Fine.
But Allison is the priority.

21:55.430 --> 21:56.520
Alright?
Bring her to the house.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.770
See if you can find
any link

21:57.810 --> 21:59.610
between this guy Michael
and her Lordship here.

21:59.650 --> 22:00.610
Take me as your backup.

22:00.650 --> 22:01.530
Great.

22:02.730 --> 22:03.860
So, let me ask you.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.820
Does this look,
the Jake look --

22:06.860 --> 22:08.910
I mean-- Do you think it
looks good on me?

22:08.950 --> 22:11.870
Des, I don't think
you wanna be like Jake.

22:11.910 --> 22:13.660
I should unzip the jacket.

22:16.250 --> 22:18.420
Jake, Jake, Jake.
You and the women, hey?

22:18.460 --> 22:19.630
You and that judge?

22:19.670 --> 22:21.840
-I could see the chemistry.
-For the record,

22:21.880 --> 22:23.670
when we actually dated,
she was a Crown Prosecutor.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.090
If you sensed anything,

22:25.130 --> 22:27.510
it was probably her wanting
to stab me in the face.

22:27.550 --> 22:31.760
And now the super hot cop,
current girlfriend?

22:31.800 --> 22:33.350
Yeah.
She is hot.

22:33.390 --> 22:34.560
I'll admit it.

22:36.140 --> 22:37.020
Yeah.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.940
So what's the point
of dating a cop

22:39.980 --> 22:41.110
if you don't
get the perks?

22:41.150 --> 22:42.520
I mean,
shouldn't she be helping you?

22:42.570 --> 22:44.360
We try to keep those two worlds,
you know,

22:44.400 --> 22:45.360
kind of separate.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.780
If you were
my boyfriend,

22:46.820 --> 22:48.360
there would be
reporter perks.

22:48.860 --> 22:50.360
Yeah, like what?

22:50.410 --> 22:52.620
Getting the paper delivered
late to my house every day?

22:52.660 --> 22:55.330
Long hours.
Crappy lunches.

22:55.370 --> 22:57.790
Practically no pay.
And--

22:57.830 --> 22:58.790
possibly,

22:58.830 --> 23:00.830
free classifieds.

23:00.880 --> 23:01.960
[phone buzzes]

23:02.670 --> 23:05.050
Wow.
What a deal.

23:06.630 --> 23:07.840
Yeah.
Walter.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.930
Please tell me
you found the files.

23:09.970 --> 23:11.470
Not exactly.

23:11.510 --> 23:14.890
We found the girl.
And we placed a tracker on her,

23:14.930 --> 23:16.350
which we hope will lead us
to the files.

23:16.390 --> 23:18.730
And by we, you mean who?
Des?

23:20.230 --> 23:22.060
Look, Walter,
if we find the gal,

23:22.100 --> 23:24.320
there's a good chance we'll get
what you want, alright?

23:24.360 --> 23:26.190
Well. you gotta find
the files, Jake.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.240
And soon.
I'm in court tomorrow.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.950
Buddy, I'm having
a bit of a day, okay?

23:29.990 --> 23:32.160
So if you just give me a break.
And I'll call you later.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.280
Oh.

23:34.410 --> 23:35.830
So much to do.

23:39.080 --> 23:42.830
Ah, okay,
Your Highness.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.130
I really think
we should get going soon.

23:45.170 --> 23:46.800
[Allison] Give me a sec, Des.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.840
[knocking]

23:48.880 --> 23:50.800
Hello?
Who is it?

23:50.840 --> 23:52.090
Jake?

23:52.130 --> 23:53.510
It's me.
The girl with the stalker.

23:53.550 --> 23:55.760
Colleen. I'm hurt.
Open the door.

23:55.810 --> 23:58.930
[beeping]

23:58.980 --> 24:01.900
Um. Yeah, ah.

24:02.690 --> 24:04.150
Yeah.
Just one second.

24:04.190 --> 24:05.360
Hurry.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.110
Hey.

24:09.150 --> 24:11.740
[beeping]

24:11.780 --> 24:13.910
You're not here to kiss me,
are you?

24:16.030 --> 24:17.620
Sorry, little guy.

24:17.660 --> 24:19.000
Whoa!

24:19.040 --> 24:21.750
[beeping]

24:24.000 --> 24:26.040
Did you just get
the same text as me?

24:26.080 --> 24:28.460
Yeah. It looks like the girl
who stole Walter's files

24:28.500 --> 24:31.170
is back at the office.
Call Des.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.720
[tire's screeching]

24:38.350 --> 24:39.390
You.

24:40.770 --> 24:43.100
You're the one
who stole Walter's files.

24:43.140 --> 24:44.690
You're not the psychic Colleen.

24:44.730 --> 24:46.060
I'm not a psychic.

24:46.110 --> 24:47.190
But I can tell you your future,

24:47.230 --> 24:48.610
if you don't tell me where the
judge is.

24:48.650 --> 24:50.940
Yeah, well,
Jake's coming back soon.

24:50.980 --> 24:53.070
And he's not gonna be happy you
keep beating up his best friend.

24:53.110 --> 24:54.450
The judge.

24:54.490 --> 24:56.200
Or you're gonna hurt much more
than you did before.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.660
You already have Walter's files.
What else do you want?

24:58.700 --> 25:00.620
Listen to me.
Jenkins.

25:00.660 --> 25:01.870
Where is she?

25:01.910 --> 25:03.710
[clanging]

25:03.750 --> 25:06.080
Uh, there's mice in there.

25:06.130 --> 25:09.340
There's large mice.
They're like cats.

25:09.380 --> 25:10.420
Cats...

25:11.920 --> 25:14.260
She's here.
Get down here.

25:21.770 --> 25:24.060
Uh, Colleen.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.900
What the hell is going on,
exactly?

25:25.940 --> 25:26.860
Mr. Doyle.

25:28.230 --> 25:29.650
I wouldn't make any sudden
moves, if I were you.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.230
Jake, I don't want anyone
to get hurt.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.320
What?
Did you psychic powers

25:33.360 --> 25:34.570
tell you where to find Allison?

25:34.610 --> 25:36.610
Oh no.
That was all you Jake.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.620
Thanks.

25:37.660 --> 25:38.990
Now I have what I really want.

25:39.030 --> 25:40.370
Let's go.

25:40.410 --> 25:41.870
Allison. Do you remember
what I taught you

25:41.910 --> 25:43.660
on our third date?

25:43.700 --> 25:45.460
So not the time,
Jake.

25:46.210 --> 25:47.830
No, not the second date.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.090
The third date.

25:49.130 --> 25:51.420
Remember?

25:51.460 --> 25:52.880
Shut up and move.

25:52.920 --> 25:53.920
Ooof!

25:53.970 --> 25:54.970
Oooh!

25:57.680 --> 25:59.430
[punch]

25:59.470 --> 26:00.430
[punch]

26:00.470 --> 26:01.350
[gunshot]

26:10.480 --> 26:12.190
Everyone,
everyone okay?

26:13.320 --> 26:14.030
Thanks to you.

26:15.150 --> 26:16.990
Now, we can predict
your future, huh?

26:26.370 --> 26:27.410
[Jake] Who hired you

26:27.460 --> 26:29.420
and Michael
to kill the judge?

26:29.460 --> 26:31.420
Does it have something to do
with one of her cases?

26:31.460 --> 26:33.550
-I'm not talking.
-Alright.

26:33.590 --> 26:34.920
We'll just drop you off
to the cops, then.

26:34.960 --> 26:35.970
Nice and easy.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.680
I want a deal.

26:39.720 --> 26:40.680
I want protection.

26:40.720 --> 26:41.760
And I want money.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.560
I can get you a deal.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.020
And protection.

26:46.060 --> 26:47.560
But I want the whole story.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.190
Everything.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.310
Yeah, look. I don't know
why they want you dead.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.480
But I was hired by some pretty
powerful people.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.860
Lawyers.

26:54.900 --> 26:55.820
Jackman and Drake.

26:55.860 --> 26:58.400
A law firm?

26:58.450 --> 26:59.820
Why is a law firm trying
to kill me?

27:01.410 --> 27:03.990
Jackman and Drake is one of
the largest law firms around.

27:04.030 --> 27:05.750
They've got a case
in front of me right now.

27:05.790 --> 27:06.830
Casino.

27:06.870 --> 27:08.660
-The new casino deal.
-Casino deal?

27:08.710 --> 27:09.790
Yeah, the province
is planning

27:09.830 --> 27:11.790
to ban all
the video lotto terminals.

27:11.830 --> 27:14.290
And they're replacing them with
a casino on Bell Island.

27:14.340 --> 27:16.710
A casino on Bell Island?
I thought that idea went away.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.050
That is huge.

27:18.090 --> 27:19.680
No, no, no, no.
You're not hearing any of this.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.260
You can't write about this.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.810
Fine. Then I want to know what
happened between you and Jake.

27:23.850 --> 27:24.930
Is she for real?

27:24.970 --> 27:27.100
Kyla, the woman's life
is in danger.

27:27.140 --> 27:28.890
Alright?
So knock it off.

27:28.930 --> 27:32.560
As far as Jake and I go.
We just moved on.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.060
Which is what you should do.

27:34.110 --> 27:35.150
Or I'm going to get
the cops to get

27:35.190 --> 27:37.860
all of your unpaid
parking tickets.

27:37.900 --> 27:38.940
Got it?

27:38.990 --> 27:40.950
Got ya.
I won't write a thing.

27:40.990 --> 27:43.160
Yes.
I will also not write anything.

27:44.740 --> 27:45.990
Be straight with me.

27:46.030 --> 27:47.700
Do you think my clothes
are cool, or not?

27:47.750 --> 27:49.370
The anticipation
is really killing me.

27:54.750 --> 27:55.960
What happened with Colleen?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.500
Oh, right.
Oh, it went great.

27:57.550 --> 28:00.170
Actually, she said I had really
nice bone structure.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.130
And?

28:01.180 --> 28:02.090
And?

28:02.130 --> 28:03.800
And, oh.
And I thanked her.

28:03.840 --> 28:05.550
And I dropped her off
at the RNC.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.350
Why, what's going on here?

28:07.770 --> 28:09.850
[Allison] Jackman and Drake
are arguing on behalf of

28:09.890 --> 28:11.640
the casino's investors
and developers.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.650
Their projections are based
entirely on fictional numbers.

28:14.690 --> 28:16.570
I'm guessing you weren't going
to rule in their favor.

28:16.610 --> 28:18.070
If I die,
there's a mistrial.

28:18.110 --> 28:19.990
And by the time a new trial
could be mounted --

28:20.030 --> 28:21.610
They'd have a chance
to get rid of all the evidence.

28:21.650 --> 28:23.660
And that would be billion
of profit -- lost.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.280
A reason to kill a judge.

28:25.320 --> 28:28.330
But, but, but --
a pretty judge.

28:28.370 --> 28:29.500
A smart,

28:29.540 --> 28:30.660
talented --

28:30.700 --> 28:32.170
I got these off of Colleen.

28:35.170 --> 28:36.210
Are these Walter's files?

28:36.250 --> 28:37.710
-Mm hm.
-Nice work.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.800
That's an excellent haul.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.720
I gotta get these to him.

28:40.760 --> 28:41.720
Right away.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.010
Wait. Whoa!
I'm coming with you.

28:43.050 --> 28:44.510
I'm not going to be
a sitting duck.

28:44.550 --> 28:46.640
I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

28:46.680 --> 28:47.970
Des will look after you.

28:48.010 --> 28:49.220
Right Des?
Put her in the van.

28:49.260 --> 28:50.560
Okay.
And just keep driving around.

28:50.600 --> 28:51.770
And don't stay
in one spot too long.

28:51.810 --> 28:53.140
You'll be fine.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.570
Oh, what a time
we're gonna have, Allison.

28:57.610 --> 28:59.570
Judge Allison.

29:05.570 --> 29:06.570
You found them.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.080
Yes.
God, he's needy.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.160
I should have stayed
with Jenkins.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.830
What? Jenkins?
Like, what? You're ex?

29:11.870 --> 29:13.330
Okay, alright.
Look.

29:13.370 --> 29:15.330
She cannot know
that I lost these files.

29:15.370 --> 29:18.000
She's presiding
over some of these cases.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.840
What the hell
is going on here anyway?

29:19.880 --> 29:21.840
We recovered
them from --

29:21.880 --> 29:23.260
from this girl.

29:23.300 --> 29:25.180
Is this the one who strung you
up by your underwear?

29:25.220 --> 29:26.340
Oh, yeah.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.340
That's her.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.600
Man she is beautiful.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.430
You can see how
I was suckered in, right.

29:30.470 --> 29:32.560
She's turned witness for us,
okay?

29:32.600 --> 29:33.930
We dropped her off
with the cops.

29:33.980 --> 29:36.190
Wait.
I said no cops.

29:36.230 --> 29:38.820
Check the files, meatball.
See if they're all there.

29:40.270 --> 29:42.150
No.

29:42.190 --> 29:43.110
Son of a --

29:43.150 --> 29:44.110
Let me guess.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.570
The one that's missing.

29:45.610 --> 29:46.990
It's about a casino
on Bell Island, maybe?

29:47.030 --> 29:49.620
Yes.
What's going on?

29:49.660 --> 29:51.620
I'm pretty sure that the people
who are after you,

29:51.660 --> 29:54.000
are the same ones
who are after Allison.

29:54.040 --> 29:55.210
[Kyla]
But the word of a woman

29:55.250 --> 29:56.830
with priors
versus a prestigious law firm?

29:58.130 --> 29:59.880
You're right. We need proof.
We need evidence.

29:59.920 --> 30:03.090
What would be in that file
that's they'd want to steal it?

30:03.130 --> 30:04.510
I don't know.

30:04.550 --> 30:06.930
I didn't have
much of a case, really.

30:06.970 --> 30:10.220
Some files,
some statistics.

30:10.260 --> 30:12.310
Some expert statements.

30:12.350 --> 30:13.890
-There's a video.
-A video?

30:13.930 --> 30:14.850
A video of what?

30:14.890 --> 30:17.100
A shareholder dinner.

30:17.140 --> 30:18.310
I was gonna use it

30:18.350 --> 30:19.980
to highlight
misappropriation of funds.

30:20.020 --> 30:20.900
Kickbacks.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.490
Was this fella there?

30:24.530 --> 30:25.200
Oh yeah.
Definitely.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.780
He was talking
to the casino owners.

30:29.820 --> 30:31.160
That would be a reason
to connect them.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.330
No wonder
he wanted it stolen.

30:32.370 --> 30:33.910
If he was gonna
take care of the judge,

30:34.660 --> 30:36.460
then we need that video.

30:36.500 --> 30:39.330
Or a way to connect Michael
to the casino group.

30:40.420 --> 30:41.710
The gun.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.210
Michael's gun.

30:43.250 --> 30:44.550
I can bring it
to the cops.

30:44.590 --> 30:47.970
They can run a trace.
See if anything comes up.

30:48.010 --> 30:50.470
If I was a cop,
I'd run it for you.

30:52.010 --> 30:53.010
Just...

31:02.360 --> 31:04.610
-What do you need done?
-Hey. Hey you.

31:04.650 --> 31:07.070
-Hey.
-Hey. How are you?

31:07.110 --> 31:08.070
Never mind that.

31:08.110 --> 31:09.110
Unless you've come
to confess

31:09.150 --> 31:10.740
you've beaten up
my grandfather too.

31:10.780 --> 31:12.410
No, not yet.
Listen.

31:13.530 --> 31:14.830
About that whole thing
with Crocker.

31:14.870 --> 31:16.120
Forget it.
What do you need?

31:16.160 --> 31:17.960
-I'll do it for you.
-For me?

31:18.000 --> 31:19.170
Really?
Well, actually,

31:19.210 --> 31:20.670
I was hoping that --

31:20.710 --> 31:22.500
I need someone to run a trace
on this shot gun.

31:22.540 --> 31:23.500
There's a shot gun in here --

31:23.540 --> 31:25.000
like for fingerprints, or
whatever.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.340
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for Des.

31:27.380 --> 31:29.300
He asked me.

31:29.340 --> 31:30.680
Well, it was nice to see --

31:30.720 --> 31:32.550
Nice to see you.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.720
[ring]

31:36.890 --> 31:37.850
Hello?

31:37.890 --> 31:38.980
How's Allison?
Is she okay?

31:39.020 --> 31:42.940
Ah, fine, fine.
She's trying her best.

31:42.980 --> 31:45.900
Um--

31:45.940 --> 31:50.820
I think, she might,
like, like me , like me.

31:53.160 --> 31:55.450
But you should know I would
never betray your trust,

31:55.490 --> 31:56.660
in that way.

31:56.700 --> 31:57.910
I mean,

31:57.950 --> 32:00.120
unless, of course,

32:00.160 --> 32:01.670
you were cool with that.

32:01.710 --> 32:03.250
Whatever.
That was a good save.

32:03.290 --> 32:06.130
You know, getting Tinny to run
a trace on the gun like that.

32:06.170 --> 32:07.380
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:07.420 --> 32:08.460
I didn't call her.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.090
Really?

32:10.130 --> 32:11.260
Unless I was supposed to.

32:11.300 --> 32:14.180
But honestly, even then,
I didn't.

32:14.220 --> 32:15.510
Oh, crappo.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.180
[Jake] Des, what the hell is going on?

32:18.220 --> 32:20.640
He's blocking us in. Jake!
He's blocking the van in.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.940
I told you we should have gotten
ejection seats, Jake.

32:22.980 --> 32:24.610
You live and you learn.

32:24.650 --> 32:26.230
Hey, Des?
What are we gonna do?

32:26.270 --> 32:27.860
Run, Des!
Run!

32:27.900 --> 32:29.570
No, no, no.
Ummm.

32:33.490 --> 32:34.870
I need you
to take off your clothes.

32:34.910 --> 32:36.030
What?
What did you just say?

32:36.080 --> 32:38.160
Some of your clothes.

32:41.710 --> 32:42.790
Yeah.

32:45.460 --> 32:46.500
You coming out?

32:46.540 --> 32:48.670
Or is this whole thing
gonna turn ugly?

32:48.710 --> 32:49.880
Hey stop!

32:49.920 --> 32:51.880
Judge, I'm going to have
to run you down.

32:51.920 --> 32:52.930
This could have been easier.

32:56.550 --> 32:57.760
[bang]

33:01.680 --> 33:03.440
See?

33:03.480 --> 33:06.150
Did you have to make me do that?
Hmm?

33:07.270 --> 33:08.320
What the hell?

33:08.360 --> 33:09.270
Haaa!

33:09.320 --> 33:11.190
Looking for someone else,
were we?

33:16.910 --> 33:19.740
Yeah, you thought
I was the judge, yeah!

33:19.790 --> 33:21.620
I knows you did.
Arrgh!

33:21.660 --> 33:23.370
It's not a good idea,
you little moron.

33:23.410 --> 33:27.330
[phone rings]

33:27.380 --> 33:28.920
Des? Talk to me.
What's going on?

33:28.960 --> 33:30.630
So I got your weird
little friend.

33:30.670 --> 33:32.050
And you got something I want.

33:32.090 --> 33:33.010
What do you want?

33:33.050 --> 33:34.380
Hold on.

33:34.430 --> 33:36.470
Ow!

33:36.510 --> 33:37.430
Jake.

33:37.470 --> 33:39.180
Des.
Is Allison safe?

33:39.220 --> 33:40.520
Yeah.
She is.

33:43.020 --> 33:45.060
So I think it's trade time.

33:45.100 --> 33:47.900
Your stupid assistant
for Judge Jenkins.

33:47.940 --> 33:50.860
Half an hour.
No cops.

33:50.900 --> 33:51.900
You find her.

33:53.530 --> 33:54.780
Great.

33:58.910 --> 34:00.740
We have to find Allison,
okay.

34:00.780 --> 34:02.910
Otherwise they have no reason
to keep Des alive.

34:02.950 --> 34:06.580
[phone buzzes]

34:06.620 --> 34:10.500
Ah, Leslie.
Hi.

34:10.540 --> 34:11.800
You know what I have to deal
with right now?

34:11.840 --> 34:13.300
What's that?

34:13.340 --> 34:15.260
Traffic is calling me because
they know we're going out.

34:15.300 --> 34:16.840
Traffic is--
What?

34:16.880 --> 34:19.430
They're calling wondering why
your top secret surveillance van

34:19.470 --> 34:22.310
is on a sidewalk at the corner
of Newtown and Howley.

34:22.350 --> 34:24.180
That's obviously
where Des left it.

34:24.220 --> 34:27.140
He forgot,
because he was sleeping.

34:27.190 --> 34:31.230
Go get it.
Please.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.650
And hi.

34:32.690 --> 34:34.240
Hi.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.110
Listen.

34:36.150 --> 34:39.950
I gave Tinny a gun
to run some prints on it.

34:39.990 --> 34:41.530
Did anything
come back from that?

34:41.580 --> 34:42.990
Do you know?
Could you check for me?

34:43.030 --> 34:44.700
You can't ask a cadet
to do that, Jake.

34:44.740 --> 34:47.120
Especially with Tinny's
graduation around the corner.

34:47.160 --> 34:49.210
I know. I know.
It was really bad of me.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.380
Having said that--

34:51.420 --> 34:52.880
Did anything come up on it?

34:56.510 --> 34:59.260
No prints or DNA.

34:59.300 --> 35:00.340
But this is weird.

35:00.390 --> 35:01.510
What?

35:01.550 --> 35:03.600
The gun's registered
to a drug dealer

35:03.640 --> 35:05.100
who's serving time
in the pen.

35:05.140 --> 35:06.930
A drug dealer?
Who represented him in court?

35:06.980 --> 35:07.930
Do you know?

35:07.980 --> 35:09.940
Attorneys from
Jackman and Drake.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.360
Listen, I appreciate it.
And---

35:14.400 --> 35:16.610
I'll call you later,
okay?

35:18.530 --> 35:20.030
You should have told her.

35:20.070 --> 35:21.240
Whatever.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.410
At least now we have a link

35:22.450 --> 35:23.830
between that shotgun and the
casino.

35:23.870 --> 35:25.580
Right. That's the evidence
we need to put 'em away.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.330
And if Allison left that
surveillance van at that corner,

35:27.370 --> 35:28.500
it means --

35:28.540 --> 35:29.790
She went back
to her little hiding spot.

35:29.830 --> 35:31.210
Let's go.

35:35.670 --> 35:36.630
Allison?

35:36.670 --> 35:39.050
We know you're in here.

35:40.090 --> 35:41.930
I need your help.

35:41.970 --> 35:43.640
You need my help?

35:43.680 --> 35:45.350
They have Des.

35:45.390 --> 35:48.020
And Michael won't give him back
unless we do an exchange.

35:48.060 --> 35:49.140
You for --

35:49.190 --> 35:50.060
For Des.

35:51.100 --> 35:53.940
He saved me.
Of course. Let's go.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.570
We need to take them down Jake.

35:55.610 --> 35:56.820
Jake, what are you --

35:56.860 --> 35:58.900
You two aren't serious.
They'll kill us all.

35:58.940 --> 36:01.610
There is no us all, alright?
So --

36:01.660 --> 36:02.740
You got her?

36:02.780 --> 36:04.280
Ah, yeah.
Where do you want to meet?

36:04.320 --> 36:06.450
Your favorite place.
The strip club.

36:06.490 --> 36:07.660
Great Big She.

36:07.700 --> 36:10.410
Okay, we'll be there
as soon as we can.

36:10.460 --> 36:11.460
These strip clubs are

36:11.500 --> 36:12.460
super unsanitary.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.830
At the same time,

36:13.880 --> 36:17.170
they're kinda classy,
when the lights are dimmed.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.170
You're not actually
gonna do this?

36:20.220 --> 36:21.220
There's gotta be another way.

36:21.260 --> 36:22.300
Don't follow us.

36:37.190 --> 36:38.780
[Jake] Alright,
alright, alright.

36:38.820 --> 36:40.530
I brought her, okay?
So let Des go.

36:40.570 --> 36:42.700
So you have no problems sending
a judge to her death.

36:42.740 --> 36:43.740
It's interesting.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.620
This is my ex.

36:45.660 --> 36:47.490
It was a bad break up.

36:47.530 --> 36:49.240
It wasn't a bad breakup.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.750
Just let Des go,
now.

36:51.790 --> 36:53.710
You are, like,
the best boss ever.

36:53.750 --> 36:54.920
I'm not even
gonna complain

36:54.960 --> 36:56.330
that today,
I'm technically your partner

36:56.380 --> 36:57.590
in the labor
agreement I drew up

36:57.630 --> 36:59.300
that would constitute
an increase in my wages.

36:59.340 --> 37:01.630
If I'm gonna die,
could we just hurry it up?

37:01.670 --> 37:03.380
You untie him,
and just leave.

37:04.260 --> 37:05.300
And you remember

37:05.340 --> 37:06.680
what my friends
and I can do to you

37:06.720 --> 37:08.560
if you ever decide that you want
to avenge somebody.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.640
Just keep your underwear on,
okay?

37:11.680 --> 37:14.980
I'm reaching in my pocket
for a knife to cut him loose.

37:15.020 --> 37:16.230
You wanna stay calm.

37:16.270 --> 37:17.980
Right Des?

37:18.020 --> 37:19.610
[punch]

37:20.690 --> 37:21.280
Hurry! Hurry!

37:21.320 --> 37:22.610
Uhh!

37:22.650 --> 37:24.610
[Michael] I thought you
were smarter than this!

37:29.370 --> 37:30.700
Oh!

37:32.250 --> 37:33.250
Ugh!

37:35.830 --> 37:36.920
[punch]

37:38.090 --> 37:38.960
[punch]

37:44.880 --> 37:46.260
Everyone okay?

37:46.300 --> 37:47.390
Fine.

37:47.430 --> 37:51.560
You guys are --
You are an awesome team.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.480
Sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.140
This one's
just for you guys.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.230
Can someone untie me,
please?

38:12.580 --> 38:15.620
[Allison] Jake Doyle.
You have a way of reconnecting.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.500
-Hi.
-Hi.

38:21.290 --> 38:23.380
I just stopped by to say:

38:23.420 --> 38:26.760
No hard feelings about our past.
And--

38:26.800 --> 38:29.800
Thanks for saving my future.

38:29.850 --> 38:33.890
Well that's, that's profound.

38:33.930 --> 38:34.930
I'm glad you're okay.

38:41.860 --> 38:43.270
I'll see you around.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.360
Hopefully not standing
in front of me in court.

38:47.820 --> 38:49.030
Okay.

38:53.870 --> 38:59.630
[phone buzzes]

38:59.670 --> 39:00.790
Hello.

39:02.790 --> 39:03.800
Leslie Bennett.

39:03.840 --> 39:06.260
I gotta tell you.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.470
I can't wait to see your face.

39:15.850 --> 39:16.810
Feels light.

39:16.850 --> 39:18.390
Hmmm.
'Cause paper's so heavy.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.640
It's all there.

39:19.690 --> 39:23.060
All the information
I've got on Doyle so far.

39:23.110 --> 39:25.480
Do I get the privilege of
knowing what this is all about?

39:25.530 --> 39:27.360
No.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.990
[Monica]
But it's going to be good.

39:31.030 --> 39:33.660
You don't mind doing this?
No second thoughts I hope.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.580
Just doing my job.

39:35.620 --> 39:37.040
He does his every day,
right?

39:39.750 --> 39:41.960
Alright.

39:48.050 --> 39:50.130
This was lovely.
I'm glad we did this.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.380
Me too.
What a meal.

39:51.430 --> 39:53.680
Oh hey. Thank you. But
Kathleen cooked it.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.810
Well, I learned
the recipe from Dad.

39:55.850 --> 39:57.100
[Mal]
I'd like to say something.

39:57.140 --> 39:59.390
Jake. Listen to you your father.
For once.

39:59.430 --> 40:01.060
Oh, great,
a big wine speech.

40:01.100 --> 40:02.860
Shut it.
Shut it.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.110
Now hear this.

40:04.860 --> 40:06.360
Whatever you have to do.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.280
Shag that.
Whatever I have to do.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.440
Whatever it takes.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.860
Do not lose this one.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.700
She's the greatest thing that
ever happened to you.

40:12.740 --> 40:13.870
And to us.

40:13.910 --> 40:15.490
In short,
what I mean is,

40:15.530 --> 40:17.290
I want you two,
Jake and Leslie,

40:18.750 --> 40:21.710
I want you to be at this table
for a long, long time.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.500
-Here, here.
-I second that.

40:23.540 --> 40:24.380
And I fourth.

40:24.420 --> 40:25.750
And I'd just like to say that

40:25.790 --> 40:28.550
I also would like to be
at this table a long time.

40:28.590 --> 40:30.130
Thank you Malachy.

40:30.170 --> 40:31.680
You're welcome.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.180
I'd like that too.

40:34.220 --> 40:36.220
I couldn't agree more.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.190
[Rose]
Hey, Tinny.

40:42.230 --> 40:43.310
Come on and have a seat.

40:43.350 --> 40:44.270
Hey, come on in.

40:44.310 --> 40:45.230
You hungry?

40:45.270 --> 40:47.150
No, I'm good.

40:52.030 --> 40:53.990
Excuse me.

40:55.990 --> 40:56.990
Hey.

40:57.030 --> 40:59.580
Hey.
Little one.

40:59.620 --> 41:00.870
Little one?

41:00.910 --> 41:01.870
Don't get me started,
Jake.

41:01.910 --> 41:02.830
Oh, come on.

41:02.870 --> 41:03.750
Please.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.880
Look, I realize that you're
rotted with me.

41:07.590 --> 41:08.750
Oh, you do, do you?

41:10.130 --> 41:12.260
Can you just,
not be?

41:12.300 --> 41:13.260
Just don't

41:13.300 --> 41:14.970
be rotted with me.

41:15.010 --> 41:16.300
I know there are
a pile of people

41:16.340 --> 41:17.510
that would be
happy to have

41:17.550 --> 41:19.810
a family as protective
as you crowd are.

41:19.850 --> 41:20.810
But?

41:20.850 --> 41:22.730
I'm grateful.
I am.

41:22.770 --> 41:23.810
But?

41:23.850 --> 41:24.890
But --

41:24.940 --> 41:27.860
Stop beating
the hell out of my dad.

41:27.900 --> 41:29.610
You know even hearing you
call him that --

41:31.570 --> 41:32.780
You have no idea.

41:32.820 --> 41:35.320
Well, get over it.
He's my father.

41:42.330 --> 41:44.210
We all know
I really think of you as

41:44.250 --> 41:45.920
my "Dad" dad.

41:47.580 --> 41:49.380
You and Poppy
raised me that way.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.260
So don't worry.

41:53.300 --> 41:55.840
I still loves ya.

42:03.350 --> 42:06.020
So I was at the offices
of the Independent,

42:06.060 --> 42:08.150
just trying to make sure
I didn't show up in any stories.

42:08.190 --> 42:09.520
And I saw

42:09.560 --> 42:13.280
an advance copy
of tomorrow's paper.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.820
You're not gonna like it.

42:18.110 --> 42:19.830
[Jake]
Kyla MacRury.

42:19.870 --> 42:22.330
You little arse.

42:22.370 --> 42:23.950
Leslie is gonna kill you.

42:29.170 --> 42:32.210
Not as bad
as she's gonna kill Kyla.
