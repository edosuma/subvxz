in the LCS.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.524
It was amazing.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.177
CREAMCHEESE:
Got our GM, Paul, over here.

08:46.221 --> 08:47.657
-Hi. How you doing?
-ORGANIZM: GM Paul, what's up?

08:47.701 --> 08:49.616
-CREAMCHEESE: Yo, Nightfall.
-NIGHTFALL: Yeah.

08:49.659 --> 08:51.008
-CREAMCHEESE: Say what up
to Organizm.
-NIGHTFALL: Hey, man.

08:51.052 --> 08:52.575
-Welcome.
-ORGANIZM: Yo, what's up, bro?

08:52.619 --> 08:54.969
And then I see Nightfall

08:55.012 --> 08:56.927
-and Bucket.
-BGOLBKTOFWTR over here.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.929
-Yo, Bap!
-What?

08:58.973 --> 09:00.670
Organizm's here!

09:00.714 --> 09:02.454
ORGANIZM: It's like,
these guys don't know it,

09:02.498 --> 09:03.934
but I've already learned a lot
from them.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.457
And now it's like

09:05.501 --> 09:08.243
I'm here as the future
of Fugitive Gaming.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.462
The whole thing
feels like a dream come true.

09:10.506 --> 09:13.422
CREAMCHEESE:
The Academy, the minor leagues,
your new home.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.337
Look, I've seen you play.
You're good, dude.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.121
Like, y-you're gonna be
in the scrims with us

09:17.165 --> 09:19.297
in, like, two years, tops.

09:19.341 --> 09:22.692
Y-You're fast, you know?
He's coming for you, Frugger.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.520
Organizm's gonna spend
his time at Academy

09:24.564 --> 09:26.827
learning from one of the
league's best veteran duos,

09:26.870 --> 09:28.437
Frugger and Creamcheese.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.961
It's really the perfect
situation for him.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.963
CREAMCHEESE:
So, uh, yeah.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.486
Make sure you don't pick up
any bad habits,

09:34.530 --> 09:35.618
especially from this guy.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.577
He's your support. Cronklyn.

09:37.620 --> 09:40.405
Cronklyn, hey, hey, hey.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.799
Hey, buddy.
Cronklyn, how you doing?

09:42.843 --> 09:45.193
You still one-tricking
Dark Harvest Maokai?

09:45.236 --> 09:47.325
-CRONKLYN: It was just one time.
-It was more than one time.

09:47.369 --> 09:51.199
And put your headphones on,
dude. Comms. Come on, bro.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.766
Of course,
there are a lot of fans

09:52.809 --> 09:54.506
who want Organizm
to start day one,

09:54.550 --> 09:57.292
but remember,
he just turned 17. [chuckles]

09:57.335 --> 09:59.729
He's gonna be the youngest
pro player in North America.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.818
And he gets to play
on the Academy team

10:01.862 --> 10:03.951
for a real title contender.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.170
RUDY JR.:
PJ.

10:06.214 --> 10:08.085
Good shit. You fucking made it.

10:25.015 --> 10:27.061
All right.

10:27.104 --> 10:28.932
[exhales]

10:28.976 --> 10:30.717
[softly]:
Yeah.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.285
[whoops]

10:34.329 --> 10:36.113
[indistinct chatter]

10:36.157 --> 10:37.462
APRIL:
Great, awesome.

10:37.506 --> 10:39.203
Okay-- Hey.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.423
It's looking good, thank you.
Yeah. Looks great, right?

10:41.466 --> 10:44.905
Um, okay, toss us
the-the Fugitive hand symbol?

10:44.948 --> 10:47.516
Asset Day is our media day.

10:47.559 --> 10:50.693
It's when we present our team
as a brand to the world.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.347
You know you don't have to do
that slow motion, right?

10:52.390 --> 10:54.349
Like, we're gonna slow it down
in post? So...

10:54.392 --> 10:55.872
-Oh. Okay.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, no,
so just go ahead

10:55.915 --> 10:57.526
-and do it regular speed.
-So just a little faster.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.920
Eventually, Fugitive
is going to have to rebrand.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.704
-What's up?
-Hey, how's it going?

11:01.748 --> 11:03.880
How you doing?
This is my daughter Emma.

11:03.924 --> 11:06.187
INDIANA:
Because the future face
of the franchise, Organizm,

11:06.230 --> 11:08.232
he's quiet, he's mysterious,
he's enigmatic.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.843
EMMA:
Would you be cool

11:09.886 --> 11:11.714
with doing an interview
for my YouTube channel?

11:11.758 --> 11:14.717
I'm sure the Fugitive fans would
love to meet the new signing.

11:14.761 --> 11:15.892
-Yeah.
-[whispers]: I'm just gonna...

11:15.936 --> 11:17.720
-Yeah, no, get out.
-Okay.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.243
Just kidding. I love you, Dad.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.245
And the current face,
Creamcheese,

11:21.289 --> 11:25.162
has a bit of a reputation
for being annoying.

11:25.206 --> 11:27.512
♪

11:27.556 --> 11:30.124
Oh, shit. These fuckers.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.735
It's gonna be
a good, good season.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.477
Not for you, for us. But...

11:35.520 --> 11:37.740
CREAMCHEESE: A lot of these
dweebs suck at Asset Day.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.742
It's like, "Dude, turn around,"
you know?

11:39.786 --> 11:41.875
Like, look at the camera,
look cool.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.051
You know? It's not that hard.

11:44.094 --> 11:48.185
Like, for me, um,
it's not hard at all.

11:48.229 --> 11:50.884
PHOTOGRAPHER:
All right, thanks, guys.

11:50.927 --> 11:53.538
One more right here.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.279
-What you gonna do, get them...
-Okay.

11:55.323 --> 11:57.542
Okay, let's get
Organizm in here.

11:57.586 --> 12:00.720
Uh... Oh, sorry.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.591
Um, they just,
they want an option

12:02.634 --> 12:04.724
with, um, with-with Organizm.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.073
CREAMCHEESE:
What's happening?
What's going on?

12:06.116 --> 12:07.422
KYLE: Yeah, sure, okay.
So, just-just...

12:08.945 --> 12:09.990
CREAMCHEESE:
Kyle?

12:12.209 --> 12:14.603
-Kyle? Are we clearing out?
-KYLE: Uh...

12:14.646 --> 12:16.823
-We're done?
-Yeah, no, I think,
I th-- I-I think,

12:16.866 --> 12:18.781
um, they just want
to get a photo

12:18.825 --> 12:20.740
with Organ, oh, uh,
with all you guys.

12:20.783 --> 12:23.307
I think it's because
he's a new star Academy sign,

12:23.351 --> 12:25.222
so they just want to have,
like, a-- it's-- I don't know.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.224
Just, it's just a photo. I'm
gonna get to the bottom of it.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.313
They want a photo
with the six of us?

12:29.357 --> 12:31.707
KYLE:
I, yeah, I guess.
Uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna...

12:31.751 --> 12:33.100
NATHAN: Same thing,
just too many people.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.579
Frugger, hop out.

12:34.623 --> 12:37.365
Let-let's get a couple shots
without Frugger.

12:37.408 --> 12:39.628
There's too many people
in the shot right now.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.238
-APRIL: Sorry, guys, um...
-I know, that's 'cause
there's an Academy player

12:41.282 --> 12:43.371
-in the shot and...
-Come with me for a second?

12:43.414 --> 12:45.590
-There's five starters in the...
-Just come talk to me
for a second?

12:45.634 --> 12:47.810
-Are we all done?
-Uh, just-just come with me.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.464
Wait, what is happening?

12:49.507 --> 12:50.987
KYLE:
I don't know what's going on,

12:51.031 --> 12:52.772
but I'm gonna figure it out.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.338
But I need you to do me a favor
just, in the meantime,

12:54.382 --> 12:56.036
because we're here,
we're on the campus

12:56.079 --> 12:57.385
and everyone's looking
and just here-- just go with it.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.779
We're just gonna
take the picture.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.693
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, let's just get tight real
quick, real quick. Here we go.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.173
-I'm gonna get to the bottom
of this.
-I couldn't possibly--

13:03.217 --> 13:04.653
I couldn't possibly imagine
what this is for.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.089
-I don't-- Okay.
-PHOTOGRAPHER: Here we go, guys.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.135
Ready, one, two
and this looks amazing.

13:08.178 --> 13:09.919

Looks great.

Do me a favor.
Organizm, hop up in the--

13:13.705 --> 13:15.229
hop up in the middle.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.144
Into the middle?

13:17.187 --> 13:18.928
Step out front, please. Yeah.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.974
-KYLE: Uh...
-CREAMCHEESE: Wait,
is this a joke?

13:21.017 --> 13:22.845
KYLE:
We're gonna figure it out.
We're gonna figure it out. Okay?

13:22.889 --> 13:24.281
I'm not-- Don't want to stand
behind a fucking Academy player.

13:24.325 --> 13:25.979
I-- This is what
I want to avoid.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.329
-Just want to avoid this.
-PHOTOGRAPHER: One, two and...

13:28.372 --> 13:30.113
-hold that.
-NATHAN: That looks awesome.

13:30.157 --> 13:31.898
-PHOTOGRAPHER: Amazing.
-CREAMCHEESE: This looks
awesome?

13:31.941 --> 13:33.769
This is-- makes
no fucking sense.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.426
NATHAN:
I get it, Kyle,
but he's starting.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.080
You know?
It's not up for debate.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.125
My guys want to see ad dollars.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.301
I do maintain that,
from a business standpoint,

13:44.345 --> 13:47.652
the best thing for your guys,
the best way to get ad dollars,

13:47.696 --> 13:49.480
is for us to win games.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.004
I understand where
you're coming from-- It's done.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.702
We're already in advanced
conversations with Razer.

13:53.745 --> 13:56.009
Well, Nathan, Razer is not
coaching this team, are they?

13:56.052 --> 13:57.749
-I'm coaching this team.
-They want to see Organizm,

13:57.793 --> 13:59.969
you know, start.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.666
-Bro.
-No. W-- No, no, no.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.103
-Please. We-we-we...
-Cream.

14:03.146 --> 14:04.539
You-- This is our year.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.193
-Please.
-You cannot do this to us.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.977
-Please. Seriously.
-Nathan, I'm sorry.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.761
-It's okay.
-Please-- Me and Frugger...
-Cream?

14:09.805 --> 14:11.198
-...have been duo-ing
all winter.
-I got this.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.069
Bap's visa issues
are finally solved.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.289
We can win this year.
If you leave me Frugger,

14:15.332 --> 14:18.205
I promise you we can win
this year, okay?

14:18.248 --> 14:20.120
This year could be it for me.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.512
He doesn't even know--
He doesn't even know

14:21.556 --> 14:23.384
what Frugger is worth
to the team.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.429
-Nathan, Frugger has been
making leaps...
-You're wrong.

14:25.473 --> 14:28.389
NATHAN:
Ah-- Look, this isn't
about Frugger, guys. You know?

14:28.432 --> 14:30.434
It's about Red Bull.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.828
-Razer. Buffalo Wild Wings.
-Who-- Are those players?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.135
-Who are th-- Who is that?
-T-Those are the players
I'm dealing with.

14:35.178 --> 14:39.313
How will Buffalo Wild Wings
feel when they put in

14:39.356 --> 14:41.837
this hotshot player
and he loses 'cause he doesn't

14:41.881 --> 14:44.187
-have experience?
-He's not ready. He's not ready.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.929
This is a business. This
works exactly like any team.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.365
It's no different
than pro basketball.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.367
Okay, but we're different
than the Kings.

14:50.411 --> 14:53.153
Like, we want to win.
Do you understand that?

14:53.196 --> 14:55.242
-Really funny.
-Okay.
-That's not a joke!

14:55.285 --> 14:56.939
-I want to win a championship.
-What do you think, I don't?

14:56.983 --> 14:59.986
CREAMCHEESE:
There is no one who has earned

15:00.029 --> 15:02.336
a spot in the LCS just
by-by playing on Twitch,

15:02.379 --> 15:04.860
and-and it-it's a--
it's as simple as that.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.906
-It's like we built
this for nothing.
-You think I'm happy?

15:06.949 --> 15:09.517
-I don't like this.
-I want to win.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.389
-Yeah, I know, I know.
-Just, I want to win one fucking
year of my life, Braxton!

15:12.433 --> 15:14.348
-I know, I know. Come here.
-I just want to fucking win.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.871
Hey, come here.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.919
[sighs]
Great.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.360
FRUGGER:
What they don't understand
is that titles

15:26.403 --> 15:29.754
aren't won with how many
Twitch subs you have.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.713
Right? It is-- it's literal--
it's all about teamwork.

15:31.756 --> 15:34.020
Th-- I said those exact words.

15:34.063 --> 15:36.196
It's so fucking frustrating.

15:36.239 --> 15:39.895
Like, he comes into my home

15:39.939 --> 15:41.941
and tells me how to build
the fucking team?

15:41.984 --> 15:43.420
Like he knows what's better

15:43.464 --> 15:44.900
-for Fugitive than I do.
-It's your team.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.946
-It's your team.
-Exactly, dude.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.644
Like, why do you think
it's called Fugitive?

15:49.687 --> 15:51.602
-Because I am the Fugitive.
-Right.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.605
I've been building this team
since I was Nutmilk, dude.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.354
APRIL:
And we have Nutmilk

16:04.398 --> 16:07.531
-on the floor.
-KYLE: Uh-oh, someone get a mop.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.925
-What's up?
-APRIL: Now, Milk,
what are we looking at?

16:09.969 --> 16:13.059
-What's, uh-- walk us through.
-What-- Just, uh, getting
set up for the qualifier.

16:13.102 --> 16:15.148
KYLE:
In 2015, we were broke,

16:15.191 --> 16:17.193
grinding it out in my apartment,

16:17.237 --> 16:19.065
playing qualifying tournaments
for no money.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.718
APRIL:
Back then,

16:20.762 --> 16:22.329
teams were just kids
who found each other online

16:22.372 --> 16:25.027
on the solo queue ladder
and decided to team up.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.637
A hundred or more teams
would enter

16:26.681 --> 16:28.465
these qualifying tournaments
for a chance

16:28.509 --> 16:30.641
just to get into
the Challenger Series.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.817
And even, like, the biggest orgs
now are still the ones

16:32.861 --> 16:34.645
that were just...
that-- like, TSM

16:34.689 --> 16:35.864
was just Andy Dinh
and some dudes and his brother

16:35.907 --> 16:37.822
and they, like, made a team.

16:37.866 --> 16:41.217
CLG is the exact same boat, just
with-with HotshotGG, basically.

16:41.261 --> 16:43.002
It was all just,
people put a team together,

16:43.045 --> 16:47.267
and one in 500
would actually go pro.

16:47.310 --> 16:50.139
CREAMCHEESE:
I was a sophomore in high school
when I started playingLeague,

16:50.183 --> 16:51.793
under the name Nutmilk,

16:51.836 --> 16:54.796
and, uh, Kyle and April
were seniors.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.406
At first I just thought
it was hilarious

16:56.450 --> 16:58.278
watching people tilt
when they'd get shit-stomped

16:58.321 --> 17:00.236
by someone named Nutmilk.

17:00.280 --> 17:04.066
But... the-- we-- then
we started getting really good.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.549
APRIL:
They would play together
every night after school,

17:08.592 --> 17:11.551
arguing about drafts,
pushing each other every day.

17:11.595 --> 17:14.424
KYLE:
We started climbing
the ranks of solo queue,

17:14.468 --> 17:16.599
and I said, "You know,

17:16.644 --> 17:19.255
we should consider
putting a team together."

17:19.299 --> 17:23.215
And we got a lot of interest,
from, uh, players like

17:23.259 --> 17:24.694
Guru, PuttPutt, Foresite.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.480
FORESITE:
All I knew about them

17:26.522 --> 17:28.134
was their aggressive playstyle.

17:28.176 --> 17:30.440
I didn't even know
what they looked like.

17:30.484 --> 17:33.356
CREAMCHEESE:
Those guys were my family.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.838
More than my family
was my family.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.102
[babbling]

17:46.152 --> 17:49.024
KYLE:
Cream had a tough time
with his family.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.374
They were just not supportive.

17:51.418 --> 17:54.899
I will be with you
all my life and beyond.

17:54.943 --> 17:57.989
CREAMCHEESE:
They didn't really care
how much time I spent gaming,

17:58.033 --> 18:00.296
but when I told them

18:00.340 --> 18:02.168
that I wasn't gonna
go to college

18:02.211 --> 18:05.997
to pursue going pro,
I mean, that was it.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.912
Like, they kicked me
out of the house.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.874
APRIL:
We let him crash on our couch

18:12.917 --> 18:14.484
in our two-bedroom apartment

18:14.528 --> 18:16.486
until he could find
a place of his own,

18:16.530 --> 18:18.532
but I think we knew
that the only way

18:18.575 --> 18:20.795
that was gonna happen
was through gaming.

18:20.838 --> 18:25.191
CREAMCHEESE:
I slept on that couch
for almost three years,

18:25.234 --> 18:27.758
which is disgusting
to think about now,

18:27.802 --> 18:30.544
like, there was stuff
on that couch that I...

18:30.587 --> 18:33.155
I probably can't
even say on camera.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.157
Like, cum.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.855
But at the time, like,
I didn't care.

18:37.899 --> 18:40.597
I was ju-- I felt
so motivated by it all.

18:40.641 --> 18:43.078
I mean, even now, I--
sometimes I miss grinding

18:43.122 --> 18:45.124
in that apartment,
'cause back then it was just us.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.299
You know? Like...

18:46.342 --> 18:48.344
It was our team.

18:48.388 --> 18:51.869
-APRIL: Hello.
-KYLE: Here he comes.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.480
-CREAMCHEESE: Oh, my God.
-APRIL: It's Ben!

18:53.523 --> 18:55.438
-KYLE: What's up?
-Hi.

18:55.482 --> 18:58.093
-Wait, wait, one sec, one sec.
-KYLE: What do you got?

18:58.137 --> 19:00.617
Do you guys like Patrón?

19:00.661 --> 19:02.097
-KYLE: Oh!
-Is he joking?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.838
APRIL:
Oh, my God.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.622
CREAMCHEESE:
Can you believe this guy?

19:05.666 --> 19:07.624
-Mmm.
-Oh, yeah.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.060
-Let's go.
-[April laughs]

19:09.104 --> 19:10.323
-Let's go.
-I feel like it's stronger.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.107
[laughs]
Where do you want to set up?

19:12.151 --> 19:14.153
The first time we got
the whole team together

19:14.196 --> 19:15.980
was for the qualifying
tournament.

19:16.024 --> 19:18.331
Back in the day, before you got
to be a professional team,

19:18.374 --> 19:21.725
you had to play in the qualifier
for the Challenger Series.

19:21.769 --> 19:25.164
KYLE: We were playing
to get into the league

19:25.207 --> 19:28.210
before the LCS.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.604
We played great
from our own places,

19:30.647 --> 19:33.215
but we decided to get together
for that qualifier

19:33.259 --> 19:36.000
because we knew
we were gonna win.

19:36.044 --> 19:39.178
And we wanted to be together,
to celebrate.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.441
-Guru. What's up, dude?
-GURU: What's up, man?

19:41.484 --> 19:43.051
-Hey, how are you?
-I'm Trevor.
-Hey.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.096
-Hey.
-Kyle. Nice to meet you.
-APRIL: Hi.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.750
ORGANIZM:
I mean, all those
players were crazy.

19:46.794 --> 19:49.840
At the time, it was, uh,
Foresite, uh, Guru,

19:49.884 --> 19:52.756
Creamcheese, Braxton, PuttPutt.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.977
-PuttPutt!
-Hello!
-[chanting]: PuttPutt! PuttPutt!

19:56.020 --> 19:57.500
CREAMCHEESE:
And when we finally
met each other,

19:57.544 --> 20:00.024
we knew our team was different.

20:00.938 --> 20:03.506
JATT:
Most teams are really bad
at branding.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.595
But Fugitive,
before they even played

20:05.639 --> 20:08.119
in the LCS,
had things to grab onto.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.773
[megaphone wailing]

20:09.817 --> 20:11.384
CREAMCHEESE:
Up-- It's time to wake up.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.386
Fugitive is not a name.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.562
Th-- Fugitive
is a lifestyle, dude.

20:15.605 --> 20:18.042
Sorry to interrupt
your wet dream, dude.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.479
Who was it,
was it Carmen Electra?

20:19.522 --> 20:21.132
[chuckles]

20:21.176 --> 20:22.830
People know that we are
not about the rules,

20:22.873 --> 20:24.919
'cause we break
every single rule.

20:24.962 --> 20:27.356
[chanting]:
Nutmilk, Nutmilk, Nutmilk.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.315
APRIL:
Perfect, perfect,
perfect. [laughs]

20:29.358 --> 20:31.839
KYLE:
April knew exactly
what made us different.

20:31.882 --> 20:33.449
-Oh-- What the...
-[laughter]

20:33.493 --> 20:35.625
A-And how to tell the world.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.540
-Don't post that, okay?
Don't post that.
-APRIL: What?

20:37.584 --> 20:39.238
INDIANA:
These guys weren't just playing
League of Legends,

20:39.281 --> 20:40.674
they were doing pranks,

20:40.717 --> 20:42.110
they were doing skits.

20:42.153 --> 20:43.503
It was wild.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.461
We were kind of the bad boys.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.855
We'd do shots of hot sauce.

20:47.898 --> 20:51.162
Oh, baby. You want to be Team
Fugitive, you got to go hard.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.295
-Line 'em up.
-Whoa.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.123
KYLE:
And I mean,
it-it's not like we were

20:55.166 --> 20:56.646
shooting Frank's RedHot

20:56.690 --> 20:57.821
or Cholula.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.910
We were doing, like, Mad Dog 44.

20:59.954 --> 21:02.391
-Black Mamba number six.
-Meet Your Maker Retribution.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.306
Like, fucking insane shit.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.916
-Fugitive, baby.
-Fugitive. To Fugitive.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.093
♪ I'm known as a fugitive...♪

21:09.137 --> 21:10.704
APRIL:
Do it, do it, do it... [laughs]

21:10.747 --> 21:12.183
CREAMCHEESE:
Millions upon millions

21:12.227 --> 21:14.490
of Scoville.

21:14.534 --> 21:17.101
I mean, you think the Golden
Guardians are doing that? No.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.756
CREAMCHEESE: And then
we'd fucking destroy, you know?

21:19.800 --> 21:21.671
It was psycho shit, honestly.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.673
GURU:
That's it, baby,
that's it, baby.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.806
Look, we never claimed
to be role models.

21:25.849 --> 21:28.199
Beat the shit out of--
Like that.

21:28.243 --> 21:31.986
CREAMCHEESE:
We were kings, and my keyboard
is, like, our mascot.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.727
I've used that keyboard
in almost

21:33.770 --> 21:36.382
every single game of League
that I've played.

21:40.299 --> 21:44.477
JATT: The story goes that when
Cream's parents kicked him out,

21:44.520 --> 21:46.435
they got into
this huge screaming match

21:46.479 --> 21:47.958
and Cream stormed off.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.222
KYLE:
Couple of weeks
after he moved in with us,

21:51.266 --> 21:54.617
he had a bad losing streak,
few games in a row.

21:54.661 --> 21:57.228
And he decided, you know,
"I need my lucky keyboard."

21:57.272 --> 22:00.188
So, uh, I called them.

22:00.231 --> 22:03.757
Which was not an easy thing
for me to do.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.673
And they said, "No,"
just flat-out no,

22:06.716 --> 22:08.718
so I plot out this whole scheme.

22:08.762 --> 22:11.460
Middle of the night,
Ocean's 11shit.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.593
I sneak back
into my parents' house.

22:13.636 --> 22:17.771
I see they've already moved out
most of the stuff from my room,

22:17.814 --> 22:19.555
but they left the keyboard.

22:19.599 --> 22:22.079
So I grab that and I ran back
to the apartment.

22:22.123 --> 22:25.431
And that night,
me and Kyle went four for four.

22:25.474 --> 22:29.348
The next day we got a knock
on the door from the cops.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.959
His parents had filed
a police report

22:32.002 --> 22:36.180
for breaking and entering
and theft.

22:36.224 --> 22:39.314
You know, it-it-- If there was
any chance of reconciliation,

22:39.358 --> 22:41.490
it was gone with that.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.449
APRIL:
I know he jokes
about it now, and, uh,

22:43.492 --> 22:47.061
you know, the story is-is legend
at this point, but...

22:47.104 --> 22:48.671
I also know that,

22:48.715 --> 22:52.893
at the time, it...
it really hurt him.

22:52.936 --> 22:56.766
CREAMCHEESE:
I always thought my parents

22:56.810 --> 22:59.160
didn't want me to be
a pro gamer because

22:59.203 --> 23:02.206
they just wanted
the best for their son.

23:02.250 --> 23:05.296
But, like...

23:05.340 --> 23:09.300
calling the cops
on your own kid?

23:11.564 --> 23:13.870
After that, I realized, like,

23:13.914 --> 23:16.482
this isn't that
they don't understand

23:16.525 --> 23:18.092
esports or whatever.

23:18.135 --> 23:21.487
Like, I know a lot of parents
go through that.

23:21.530 --> 23:22.792
It's like, they...

23:24.751 --> 23:28.363
...these people want me
to fail, actually.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.061
Like, they're rooting
for me to fail.

23:33.281 --> 23:35.196
FORESITE:
He told the story the next day,

23:35.239 --> 23:38.634
how the cops showed up
for the keyboard, and Guru goes,

23:38.678 --> 23:42.856
"Nutmilk,
you're a fucking fugitive."

23:42.899 --> 23:45.815
And in that very second,

23:45.859 --> 23:49.384
April was the one
that chimed in and said,

23:49.428 --> 23:51.430
"That's your team."

23:51.473 --> 23:53.344
"Fugitive" just felt right.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.956
And I was printing T-shirts
the next day.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.570
KYLE: We all took
a huge leap, you know?

24:01.614 --> 24:03.703
Um, you all came here,

24:03.746 --> 24:08.272
to be with us here,
um, and, uh...

24:08.316 --> 24:10.449
this is it, this is, this is
a big one for us, right?

24:10.492 --> 24:12.276
We win this, we're officially
in the Challenger Series.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.756
-Yep.
-CREAMCHEESE: It's been
so fucking sick

24:13.800 --> 24:15.192
watching you guys play...

24:15.236 --> 24:17.238
-APRIL: Yeah.
-...but having you here,

24:17.281 --> 24:18.631
it's a totally different
feeling.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.371
And I just, like,
feel good about it,

24:20.415 --> 24:22.461
-I feel like we have
a real shot.
-FORESITE: Yeah.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.027
-So let's fucking do it.
-GURU: Yeah, dude,
right back at you, man.

24:24.071 --> 24:25.768
Let's fucking do this! Let's go.

24:25.812 --> 24:26.987
-Let's go. Fugitive?
-Yeah.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.380
-Fugitive...
-On three.

24:29.424 --> 24:31.731
-Fugitive.
-One, two, three.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.602
ALL:
Fugitive!

24:33.646 --> 24:35.735
Oh, we're close. We're close.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.345
It's good.
Play around, play around.

24:37.388 --> 24:39.869
I got your back, got your back.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.306
CREAMCHEESE:
Qualifying for
the Challenger Series,

24:42.350 --> 24:45.266
it's still one of the best
moments of my entire life.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.224
GURU:
Got you-- heal me, heal me!

24:47.268 --> 24:49.052
CREAMCHEESE:
Like, I've been
around the world...

24:49.096 --> 24:51.011
APRIL:
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

24:51.054 --> 24:53.666
-Oh, my God.
-...I've played
in huge arenas...

24:53.709 --> 24:55.276
-Foresite, you still got heal?
-FORESITE: Yeah, yeah.

24:55.319 --> 24:56.886
-Okay, okay.
-Here we go.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.932
...gotten a shit-ton of girls,
you know,

24:58.975 --> 24:59.976
like the way I am now.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.935
Gucci.

25:01.978 --> 25:04.154
But back then, when...

25:04.198 --> 25:07.462
I was just Nutmilk
playing with my friends,

25:07.506 --> 25:09.595
proving to the world
what we were made out of...

25:11.597 --> 25:14.904
No matter what I do after that,
career-wise or sexually,

25:14.948 --> 25:16.427
like, it will never be that.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.560
[all shouting]

25:21.345 --> 25:23.565
[cheering, whooping]

25:25.698 --> 25:28.048
You did it! You fucking did it!

25:28.091 --> 25:30.572
[whooping]

25:30.616 --> 25:32.574
Mwah. You want this,
Mom and Dad?

25:32.618 --> 25:34.141
-You can't have this.
-Uh-uh.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.926
I'm a Fugitive. I'm too fast.

25:36.970 --> 25:39.102
And we're not stopping
at Challenger,

25:39.146 --> 25:41.888
we're going to the LCS,
we're going to win the LCS.

25:41.931 --> 25:44.760
We're gonna World,
we're gonna win World.

25:44.804 --> 25:47.546
Fuck yeah, baby.
Fugitive for life!

25:56.990 --> 25:59.732
DASH:
Opening day is never short
on surprises,

25:59.775 --> 26:02.648
but starting Organizm
over Frugger--

26:02.691 --> 26:04.563
am I the only one
shocked at this?

26:05.738 --> 26:08.175
Yes and no. Frugger's great.

26:08.218 --> 26:10.351
If you're trying to win
this year, you play Frugger

26:10.394 --> 26:11.831
and-and you might get
that title, but they're going

26:11.874 --> 26:13.920
with Organizm,
which means Fugitive

26:13.963 --> 26:15.617
are thinking about the future.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.271
APRIL:
A season opener doesn't count

26:17.314 --> 26:19.142
any more or less
than any other game,

26:19.186 --> 26:22.189
but there was more attention
on Organizm's first game

26:22.232 --> 26:25.148
than any player I can remember.

26:25.192 --> 26:29.109
-[audience cheering]
-CAPTAINFLOWERS: And you just
can't beat opening day.

26:29.152 --> 26:32.982
11 teams, 11 dreams,
with all eyes

26:33.026 --> 26:35.071
on the LCS trophy.

26:37.465 --> 26:40.076
AZAEL:
I cannot wait to see
Creamcheese pairing up

26:40.120 --> 26:42.601
with a brand-new rookie
straight out of solo queue.

26:42.644 --> 26:46.126
The infamous Killer Robot,
the 17-year-old Organizm.

26:46.169 --> 26:49.172
And you got to wonder,
how is his solo queue success

26:49.216 --> 26:50.870
gonna transition
to the LCS stage?

26:50.913 --> 26:52.611
-Yeah.
-We know the guy has talent,

26:52.654 --> 26:55.265
but is he gonna be able
to pull it off at the pro level?

26:55.309 --> 26:57.006
[Rudy Jr. whoops]

26:57.050 --> 26:59.095
Let's go, PJ.

26:59.139 --> 27:00.793
Yo, how's Team Liquid?
Are they any good?

27:00.836 --> 27:04.492
Yeah. If Dillix gets going,
they can beat anyone.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.146
He's a monster.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.236
AZAEL:
With rookie Organizm starting

27:09.279 --> 27:11.064
far earlier than
any of us expected,

27:11.107 --> 27:13.414
you've got to feel
for veteran ADC Frugger,

27:13.457 --> 27:15.808
who's watching this one
from the sidelines.

27:15.851 --> 27:18.027
-APRIL: Right.
Well, we expected that.
-Yeah.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.726
-Hey, baby.
-Right down.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.945
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
Not much action so far,

27:22.989 --> 27:24.904
but, oh, there goes SirThiccness
right onto Organizm.

27:24.947 --> 27:27.863
He lands a double taunt,
but Organizm flashes forward.

27:27.907 --> 27:29.735
And Creamcheese
lands the Zenith Blade.

27:29.778 --> 27:32.085
That'll be first blood
for Fugitive.

27:32.128 --> 27:33.564
But Organizm goes down.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.175
That's a one for one.

27:35.218 --> 27:37.394
It is action-packed
on opening day.

27:37.438 --> 27:38.700
Okay.

27:40.833 --> 27:42.748
GABRIELLA:
I think everyone was dying

27:42.791 --> 27:45.489
to know how Organizm's game
would translate to the pros.

27:45.533 --> 27:49.189
And one thing was clear:
he was not playing scared.

27:49.232 --> 27:50.799
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
He's gonna push forward,

27:50.843 --> 27:52.235
he's gonna flash forward!

27:52.279 --> 27:54.150
He's got the Triple Kill.

27:54.194 --> 27:55.935
-Yes!
-AZAEL: That is huge
for Organizm.

27:55.978 --> 27:57.980
He gets the triple.
Organizm is fed,

27:58.024 --> 28:00.417
and Fugitive has got a shot
in this game.

28:00.461 --> 28:01.767
Nice, nice.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.507
JATT:
Organizm's mechanics,

28:03.551 --> 28:05.205
you just don't see that
from a rookie.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.294
You don't see that
from anyone, really.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.252
You could really tell
he was in the zone.

28:14.605 --> 28:17.217
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
And Organizm is breaking off

28:17.260 --> 28:19.436
-from the rest of Fugitive...
-APRIL: Just push mid.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.873
What is he do--
What the fuck is he doing?

28:23.179 --> 28:25.529
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
Oh, he's going in for this.
Organizm, ready to contest.

28:25.573 --> 28:27.401
Here with the Baron,
flashing out of the way.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.185
-Still trying to find
some sort...
-Uh...

28:29.229 --> 28:31.318
...of a way to maneuver
around the 1v4.

28:31.361 --> 28:33.929
Nearly finding the kill.
Holy moly, is he gonna do it?

28:33.973 --> 28:35.278
-No!
-AZAEL: Oh!

28:35.322 --> 28:36.845
-[sighs]
-AZAEL: He almost had it.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.542
-That would've been insane.
-Yeah. Of course.

28:38.586 --> 28:43.330
TL gets the kill and
the Red Bull Baron Power Play.

28:43.373 --> 28:45.898
That should be all they need.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.950
KYLE:
That's one way to put it.

28:57.083 --> 28:58.562
RUDY JR.:
I mean, I didn't know
what the fuck was going on.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.434
Organizm started
walking up to this

29:00.477 --> 29:02.741
giant purple
magical worm thing--

29:02.784 --> 29:05.700
looked like Grimace's dick
from McDonald's--

29:05.744 --> 29:07.920
and there's a bunch of fireworks
and then he died

29:07.963 --> 29:10.052
and everybody started
cussing him the fuck out.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.054
CREAMCHEESE:
Org, I hope you
fucking like this.

29:12.098 --> 29:13.447
God-fucking-damn it.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.449
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
And Team Liquid

29:15.492 --> 29:18.887
shuts down
the solo queue superstar.

29:23.283 --> 29:25.154
How you doing? You all right?

29:25.198 --> 29:27.809
[quietly]:
I'm good.

29:27.853 --> 29:31.030
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
It's pretty clear that team
wasn't on the same page here.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.379
It's a team game. It's what

29:32.422 --> 29:33.902
everyone's gonna be
talking about.

29:33.946 --> 29:34.903
It's what Fugitive
is gonna be talking about.

29:34.947 --> 29:36.905
-Fucking...
-Hey!

29:36.949 --> 29:38.864
-...joke! No.
-That is enough.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.082
Let me tell you,
I'm not gonna play with him.

29:40.126 --> 29:41.867
Alleyway. Outside, outside now.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.259
-That's enough.
-Nathan and his fucking...

29:43.303 --> 29:45.566
Get out there.
Nightfall? Nightfall?

29:45.609 --> 29:47.350
What do you think you're doing?

29:47.394 --> 29:49.048
-Not starting with him.
-Out there.

29:49.091 --> 29:50.397
CREAMCHEESE:
We're all on the same page.

29:50.440 --> 29:51.485
We're all pushing mid.

29:51.528 --> 29:53.182
Organizm decides

29:53.226 --> 29:55.184
to contest Baron, which is...

29:55.228 --> 29:56.838
a terrible move.

29:56.882 --> 29:59.101
He almost pulled it off,
which is impressive,

29:59.145 --> 30:00.363
but so risky.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.583
So what are you even thinking?

30:02.626 --> 30:04.411
CREAMCHEESE:
But the worst part of it

30:04.454 --> 30:06.979
is he doesn't say anything.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.763
He doesn't say one fucking word.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.939
Look out for the chips.
There's just chips everywhere.

30:13.028 --> 30:14.900
Uh, sorry-- I got it.

30:17.641 --> 30:23.212
When you ignore
your teammates like that...

30:23.256 --> 30:25.040
...you're insulting
their experience.

30:25.084 --> 30:29.001
It's why you need
to communicate.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.741
I try.

30:30.785 --> 30:35.485
Look, I want you
to apologize to your teammates.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.574
Especially your support.

30:40.447 --> 30:41.578
I will.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.932
[crunching]

30:48.934 --> 30:50.196
FRUGGER:
I'm out.

30:50.239 --> 30:53.155
Come here, man.

30:53.199 --> 30:55.984
Listen, dude.
Forget the noise, okay, bro?

30:56.028 --> 30:58.117
This is a fucking joke.
Are you kidding me?

30:58.160 --> 31:00.554
-I know.
-We should be laughing
right now.

31:00.597 --> 31:02.164
-It's...
-'Cause it's such
a fucking joke.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.774
It's not funny, though.

31:03.818 --> 31:05.298
It's not funny.
You saw the game today, right?

31:05.341 --> 31:06.777
-Yeah.
-Like, this is not gonna work.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.649
-No, it's bullshit.
-So this isn't over,

31:08.692 --> 31:11.043
by any stretch, just 'cause
you're going to Academy.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.088
-Yeah.
-Which is fucking insane,
by the way.

31:13.132 --> 31:15.743
-Frugger in Academy? That
doesn't make any sense to me.
-Yeah...

31:15.786 --> 31:17.440
Frugger in Academy? Are you
kid-- Like, that doesn't even...

31:17.484 --> 31:19.747
I-- honestly, I wish
you would stop saying it.

31:19.790 --> 31:23.316
And dude, do not worry about me.

31:23.359 --> 31:25.144
Seriously, like,
I'm gonna be fine.

31:25.187 --> 31:27.842
-I'm gonna be totally fine.
-FRUGGER: Okay.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.063
[crunching]

31:31.106 --> 31:32.716
-NATHAN: Hey, honey.
What's up, baby?
-EMMA: Hi, Dad.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.067
I'm sure it can get kind
of crazy at the other house,

31:35.110 --> 31:38.505
so anytime you want to just
chill out here, come on by.

31:38.548 --> 31:40.550
We got mochi, too.
You like mochi balls?

31:40.594 --> 31:43.945
KYLE:
Organizm is staying
at the Resnick's tonight

31:43.989 --> 31:46.382
because tensions are
a-a little high at the house.

31:46.426 --> 31:48.123
BAP:
He just didn't listen.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.951
-Yeah.
-No communication,
just running at the Baron

31:49.995 --> 31:51.692
when we said push mid.

31:51.735 --> 31:53.694
Look, the fact is,
he isn't communicating

31:53.737 --> 31:55.783
with his teammates, um...

31:55.826 --> 31:57.002
But I-I keep telling Cream,
you know,

31:57.045 --> 31:58.742
you can't take that personally.

31:58.786 --> 31:59.874
'Cause at the end of the day,
he's-he's just

31:59.918 --> 32:02.355
a shy 17-year-old kid.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.400
CREAMCHEESE:
I'm trying, I am,

32:04.444 --> 32:06.576
because I know
it's not Organizm's fault

32:06.620 --> 32:08.187
that he's starting
before he's ready.

32:08.230 --> 32:10.493
It's not his fault
he lost the game for us.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.278
God-fucking-damn it.

32:12.321 --> 32:14.019
It's ownership.
It's fucking Resnick.

32:14.062 --> 32:15.716
What-- Get him
some mochi, honey.

32:15.759 --> 32:17.413
CREAMCHEESE:
So if the kid apologizes to me

32:17.457 --> 32:20.634
and shows he's ready to learn,

32:20.677 --> 32:23.506
I'll try to be civil.

32:23.550 --> 32:26.857
You know who it is. You reached
Trevor, crème de la Cream.

32:26.901 --> 32:29.034
-Leave a message at the beep.
-[phone beeps]

32:50.142 --> 32:52.013
