WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:05.086
Hey, have you ever heard of
the Van Nuys Comic-Con?

00:05.110 --> 00:05.938
‭Yeah.

00:05.939 --> 00:08.473
It's a dinky little convention
where they sell collectibles

00:08.475 --> 00:11.560
and get sad D-list celebrities
to appear. Why?

00:11.562 --> 00:13.562
I got asked
to sign autographs there.

00:13.564 --> 00:15.981
That's awesome!

00:17.117 --> 00:18.533
Is this for
Serial Ape-ist?

00:18.535 --> 00:20.152
Well, it could be
for the monkey movie.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.820
It could be
my hemorrhoid commercial.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.121
The list does not go on.

00:23.903 --> 00:25.373
- When is it?
- It doesn't matter.

00:25.375 --> 00:25.985
I'm not doing it.

00:26.009 --> 00:27.376
What? Why not?

00:27.377 --> 00:28.877
You just said yourself,
it's sad.

00:28.879 --> 00:30.212
Yeah, but it's
not pathetic.

00:30.214 --> 00:32.080
That's where
I draw the line.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.716
Come on! We'll have fun.

00:34.718 --> 00:35.884
I don't know.

00:35.886 --> 00:37.969
You'll have nerds
fawning all over you.

00:37.971 --> 00:40.672
If you don't love that,
this marriage is in trouble.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.924
I guess it wouldn't hurt
to meet some fans

00:42.926 --> 00:44.426
and make a little extra money.

00:44.428 --> 00:45.894
Yeah.

00:45.896 --> 00:48.980
Wow! An appearance
by George Lucas...

00:48.982 --> 00:51.149
...'s dermatologist.

00:52.486 --> 00:55.020

01:24.358 --> 01:26.308
You know, with us living
together, maybe we could

01:26.310 --> 01:28.477
think about having people over.

01:28.479 --> 01:30.863
We have people
over all the time.

01:30.865 --> 01:33.532
We have the maintenance people,
the pizza delivery man...

01:34.952 --> 01:37.152
...that UPS driver
who feels the need to ask

01:37.154 --> 01:39.321
how parts of me are hanging.

01:39.323 --> 01:41.490
You know what I meant.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.125
All right, fine.

01:43.127 --> 01:44.293
Let's say that

01:44.295 --> 01:45.411
we were to entertain people.

01:45.413 --> 01:47.379
What type of gathering
did you have in mind?

01:47.381 --> 01:48.664
Huh? A meal? Lunch?

01:48.666 --> 01:49.582
Brunch? Dinner?

01:49.584 --> 01:50.833
Afternoon tea?
A formal tea? Hmm?

01:50.835 --> 01:53.302
Is it a party?
And if so, what kind of party?

01:53.304 --> 01:55.087
Is it a cocktail party?

01:55.089 --> 01:56.639
A Tupperware party?

01:56.641 --> 01:59.808
Ooh, yeah--
is it a surprise party?

01:59.810 --> 02:01.010
Oh, I hope it's not

02:01.012 --> 02:02.678
a West Coast party,
'cause according to

02:02.680 --> 02:06.315
the man on the radio,
a West Coast party don't stop.

02:06.317 --> 02:08.234
I'm sorry I mentioned it.

02:08.235 --> 02:09.852
Oh, don't be.
You get your hopes up,

02:09.854 --> 02:12.488
I knock them down.
That's called teamwork.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:21.866 --> 02:23.365
That's a kick.

02:23.367 --> 02:25.034
That's an actual kick.

02:30.341 --> 02:32.708
What are you doing?

02:32.710 --> 02:34.843
I felt a kick.

02:34.845 --> 02:37.880
There's a baby in there.

02:37.882 --> 02:41.183
Oh, yeah, that's where I put it.

02:41.185 --> 02:44.270
Oh, I mean, I know
you're pregnant.

02:44.272 --> 02:45.521
I just...

02:45.523 --> 02:48.390
never connected
the idea of pregnancy

02:48.392 --> 02:51.977
and you actually having a baby.

02:51.979 --> 02:55.781
Which MIT did you go to?

02:59.203 --> 03:02.488
Oh, God, we are not ready
to have an infant in this house!

03:02.490 --> 03:04.740
We don't have a crib,
we don't have diapers.

03:04.742 --> 03:06.241
We're not baby-proofed.

03:06.243 --> 03:10.079
Anyone can just walk in off the
street and lift our toilet lids!

03:10.081 --> 03:12.498
Howie, we have time
to do all that stuff.

03:12.500 --> 03:13.916
Do we?

03:13.918 --> 03:15.084
Look at you.

03:15.086 --> 03:18.003
Willy Wonka would roll you
to the juicing room.

03:19.757 --> 03:22.391
The next person kicking you
will be me.

03:22.393 --> 03:23.342
Good night.

03:29.817 --> 03:31.817
Are we even
in a good school...?

03:31.819 --> 03:33.018
Ow!

03:34.105 --> 03:37.606
I warned you,
and I did it.

03:41.912 --> 03:43.112
What's all this?

03:43.114 --> 03:45.698
Oh, everything we need
for your autograph session--

03:45.700 --> 03:47.333
head shots, markers.
Okay.

03:47.335 --> 03:49.034
Leonard, it's sweet
you're excited about this,

03:49.036 --> 03:52.171
but it'll be a miracle if one
person asks for my autograph.

03:52.173 --> 03:53.339
Are you kidding?

03:53.341 --> 03:55.624
I once paid $20
for Theo Sassler's signature.

03:55.626 --> 03:56.875
- Who's that?
- Oh, I don't even know.

03:56.877 --> 03:59.678
I just liked his name.
Theo Sassler!

04:00.631 --> 04:02.514
Oh, and look at this.

04:02.516 --> 04:04.717
I even got a change maker.

04:08.472 --> 04:10.773
How much change you want,
little lady?

04:12.059 --> 04:15.394
Oh, there's so much
I want to change.

04:15.396 --> 04:19.113
Yeah, well, if it's a dollar,
you're in luck.

04:23.487 --> 04:25.821
What's going on here?

04:25.823 --> 04:28.540
You expressed an interest
in having people over,

04:28.542 --> 04:31.043
and I feel
I dismissed it too quickly.

04:31.045 --> 04:32.411
So, I took matters

04:32.413 --> 04:35.164
into my own hands,
and I arranged a brunch.

04:35.166 --> 04:36.999
Well, that's so nice.

04:37.001 --> 04:38.500
Who's coming?

04:38.502 --> 04:41.637
Oh, uh, Stuart,
Bert from the geology lab,

04:41.639 --> 04:43.972
and Mrs. Petrescu
from downstairs.

04:43.974 --> 04:45.674
You mean the Romanian lady
on the second floor?

04:45.676 --> 04:46.675
Yes.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.010
Oh, fun story:

04:48.012 --> 04:50.345
she grew up with ten siblings.

04:50.347 --> 04:53.098
Or possibly penguins.
Her English is atrocious.

04:54.602 --> 04:56.151
That's an odd mix of people.

04:56.153 --> 04:58.020
Well, for our first time
hosting,

04:58.022 --> 05:00.656
I thought it would be wise
to conduct a trial run.

05:00.658 --> 05:01.940
You know,
like how I practiced

05:01.942 --> 05:03.492
for that Halloween haunted house

05:03.494 --> 05:06.862
by going into the bathroom
at the bus station.

05:06.864 --> 05:09.248
You never went
into that haunted house.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.500
You never saw what jumped out
at me at the bus station.

05:11.502 --> 05:14.420
Well, thank you, Sheldon.

05:14.422 --> 05:16.455
This is a fun surprise.

05:16.457 --> 05:18.424
Oh. Well, the real surprise is

05:18.426 --> 05:21.009
how surprised you are
that I'm great at surprises.

05:21.011 --> 05:22.961
Well, that's not a
surprise at all.

05:22.963 --> 05:25.180
I mean, if I knew you
were good at surprises,

05:25.182 --> 05:26.381
I would have
expected the surprise,

05:26.383 --> 05:27.766
and therefore not
have been surprised.

05:27.768 --> 05:29.051
But as it is,
I didn't know,

05:29.053 --> 05:32.187
and therefore my surprise
should be unsurprising.

05:32.189 --> 05:35.140
Don't get me all randy.
Guests are on the way.

05:39.313 --> 05:40.946
Hi.

05:40.948 --> 05:42.481
Hey, where you been?

05:42.483 --> 05:44.817
Oh, we went and did a little
shopping for the baby.

05:44.819 --> 05:46.702
Wait till you see
the crib we found.

05:46.704 --> 05:48.821
You bought a crib without me?

05:48.823 --> 05:50.489
You're gonna love it.
Yeah.

05:50.491 --> 05:51.990
It's the highest rated one
on the market.

05:51.992 --> 05:53.325
I wouldn't even
call it a crib.

05:53.327 --> 05:56.745
I'd call it a Fortress
of Solitude for babies.

05:56.747 --> 05:59.248
Sounds expensive.

05:59.250 --> 06:00.916
Okay, well,
I may have gone

06:00.918 --> 06:04.086
a bit overboard, but you can't
put a price on safety.

06:04.088 --> 06:07.506
Though if you did, it's more
zeroes than you're expecting.

06:08.509 --> 06:10.092
But it's the safest crib
you can buy.

06:10.094 --> 06:12.094
And if you don't like it,
we can return it.

06:12.096 --> 06:14.012
Fine.
In our new minivan.

06:14.014 --> 06:16.181
Hey, what's for lunch?

06:16.183 --> 06:17.900
You bought a minivan?!

06:17.902 --> 06:19.935
It's for the baby,
and I didn't buy it.

06:19.937 --> 06:21.353
The dealer
loaned it to me

06:21.355 --> 06:23.489
for a 24-hour test drive.

06:23.491 --> 06:25.574
Though we did ding up the back
pretty good with the crib,

06:25.576 --> 06:27.276
so you might have
bought a minivan.

06:28.946 --> 06:31.580
I don't want to drive that.
It's such a mom car.

06:31.582 --> 06:33.248
The guy at the dealership said

06:33.250 --> 06:35.250
they're not just
for moms anymore.

06:35.252 --> 06:36.285
Then again,

06:36.287 --> 06:38.787
he did think
you were my husband.

06:41.175 --> 06:42.958
They thought it
at the ultrasound.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.843
Why not at the car dealership?

06:50.718 --> 06:53.302
Never been on this side
of the table before.

06:53.304 --> 06:55.521
I feel powerful.

06:55.523 --> 06:56.972
Really?

06:56.974 --> 07:01.026
I feel like I'm selling candy so
our team can get new uniforms.

07:01.028 --> 07:04.062
Okay, so it's $4.75
for a signed black-and-white

07:04.064 --> 07:05.314
and $9.95 for a color.

07:05.316 --> 07:07.482
Right. Why not five
and ten bucks?

07:07.484 --> 07:10.319
Well, I brought my moneymaker.
Let me shake it.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.405
Hey, that guy's
looking over here.

07:13.407 --> 07:14.990
Oh. You think
he's your first autograph?

07:14.992 --> 07:17.159
I don't know. Be cool.
He's coming. He's coming.

07:17.161 --> 07:19.661
- Hi!
- Hi.

07:19.663 --> 07:20.913
I love your movie.

07:20.915 --> 07:22.247
Well, thanks.

07:22.249 --> 07:23.832
It has got to be
one of the worst things

07:23.834 --> 07:25.500
I've ever seen in my life.

07:25.502 --> 07:28.420
Your love confuses me.

07:30.391 --> 07:31.638
Would you like
an autograph?

07:31.639 --> 07:32.508
Sure.

07:32.509 --> 07:33.346
Okay. Who do I make it out to?

07:33.370 --> 07:34.344
Daniel.

07:34.345 --> 07:35.644
- Okay.
- I have to ask.

07:35.646 --> 07:37.396
Were you trying to be that bad,

07:37.398 --> 07:39.348
or are you just
a terrible actress?

07:39.350 --> 07:42.818
That did not clear things up.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.856
That'll be $4.75.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.524
Keep the change.

07:49.526 --> 07:51.693
But I... Oh.

07:58.335 --> 08:00.002
Nothing about that
was good.

08:00.004 --> 08:01.870
Mm-mm.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.374
There's nothing
to be afraid of, Sheldon.

08:08.045 --> 08:10.929
The average cork speed
is 25 miles per hour.

08:10.931 --> 08:12.848
If that is too fast
around a school,

08:12.850 --> 08:15.017
it is certainly too fast
around a kitchen.

08:17.855 --> 08:19.721
Been 15 minutes.
Just sayin'.

08:19.723 --> 08:21.607
Okay. I can do this.

08:21.609 --> 08:23.058
Just give me a moment...

08:24.395 --> 08:25.861
Oh!

08:25.863 --> 08:28.063
Mimosas coming up.

08:28.065 --> 08:30.198
I once left orange juice
in my fridge so long,

08:30.200 --> 08:33.150
it tasted like a mimosa.

08:33.153 --> 08:35.236
How old was it?

08:35.239 --> 08:36.738
It's hard to say.

08:36.740 --> 08:39.157
I don't remember much
after I drank it.

08:40.995 --> 08:42.878
Would you like one,
Mrs. Petrescu?

08:42.880 --> 08:46.715
Yes. Drink is fun
and good friends-- Applebee's.

08:49.169 --> 08:51.970
She's learning English from TV.

08:52.756 --> 08:55.090
TV, good. Now back to you.

08:56.977 --> 08:58.510
Hey, guys.

08:58.512 --> 08:59.561
Hi, Stuart.

08:59.563 --> 09:00.762
These are for you.

09:00.764 --> 09:02.898
Oh, they're pretty.
Thank you.

09:02.900 --> 09:05.267
Stuart, this is Bert
from the Caltech geology lab,

09:05.269 --> 09:07.736
and this is Mrs. Petrescu
from downstairs.

09:07.738 --> 09:08.437
Nice to meet you.

09:08.439 --> 09:09.771
- Hello.
- Hey.

09:09.773 --> 09:11.106
So, what did I miss?

09:11.108 --> 09:13.442
Eh, we watched Sheldon
try to open a bottle

09:13.444 --> 09:15.444
for 15 minutes.

09:16.530 --> 09:20.916
15 minutes can save you
15% or more on car insurance.

09:24.755 --> 09:27.005
Anybody else coming
to this thing? Uh...

09:36.116 --> 09:37.749
- What's your name? Okay.
- Jeff.

09:37.773 --> 09:38.669
Okay.

09:38.670 --> 09:40.837
My favorite part
is your shower scene.

09:40.839 --> 09:43.707
Been hearing that a lot today.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.675
I even have a screen grab
on my phone.

09:45.677 --> 09:48.595
Yep, there they are.

09:48.597 --> 09:51.047
Okay, let's
keep it moving.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.717
Here you go.

09:53.719 --> 09:55.218
Should've punched that guy.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.137
Well, go ahead.
He's right over there.

09:57.139 --> 10:00.106
Why do you do that?
Can't you let me have my moment?

10:01.526 --> 10:03.193
- Hello.
- Hi.

10:03.195 --> 10:04.444
I like your movies.

10:04.446 --> 10:05.130
Thank you!

10:05.154 --> 10:06.397
I saw both of them.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.064
I assume we're still
talking about the movies,

10:08.066 --> 10:10.734
but after today,
who knows.

10:10.736 --> 10:13.153
You think I could get
a picture of us?

10:13.155 --> 10:13.954
Oh, sure.

10:13.956 --> 10:15.038
And, uh, could you be

10:15.040 --> 10:16.072
giving me a kiss?

10:16.074 --> 10:17.123
No. She cannot kiss...

10:17.125 --> 10:18.658
What is wrong with you people?!

10:18.660 --> 10:20.627
- Leonard...
- No, no, no. It's not okay.

10:20.629 --> 10:21.208
Who are you?

10:21.232 --> 10:22.468
I'm her husband.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.383
No, you're not.

10:27.636 --> 10:28.585
I am.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.420
Yeah, he really is.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.507
No.

10:37.062 --> 10:40.347
It's got a rearview camera,
there's a DVD player--

10:40.349 --> 10:42.232
oh, and check this out.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.070
It's like we're living
in the future!

10:47.072 --> 10:49.439
Hey, show her the trunk!
Show her the trunk!

10:49.441 --> 10:53.860
Imagine this:
you've got the baby in one hand,

10:53.862 --> 10:56.746
groceries in the other,
and you're thinking,

10:56.748 --> 10:59.499
"How am I gonna
open this trunk?"

10:59.501 --> 11:02.118
I'm probably thinking,
"Where's my husband,

11:02.120 --> 11:04.504
and why isn't he helping me?"

11:04.506 --> 11:07.791
You don't need my help
when you can open the trunk

11:07.793 --> 11:09.676
with a simple kick of the foot.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.385
No, it's a gentle kick;
you're doing it wrong.

11:18.387 --> 11:20.103
Here. Give me those.

11:27.195 --> 11:29.529
Uh, maybe it was
more of a circle?

11:32.200 --> 11:35.368
It's weird that guy thought
you were a couple.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.320
Yes!
Yes!

11:37.322 --> 11:38.405
See?

11:38.407 --> 11:41.374
Easy. And look at
all this cargo space.

11:41.376 --> 11:42.409
You know,
we'll get the crib out

11:42.411 --> 11:44.327
and you can take it
for a test-drive.

11:44.329 --> 11:48.164
I'm telling you,
this van is gonna be...

11:49.418 --> 11:51.501
Oh, is it your back?

11:51.503 --> 11:53.253
Uh... yeah.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.474
Anyway, let's just get
in and see if the GPS

11:57.476 --> 12:00.009
can take us to the
nearest emergency room.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.014
So until
Amy's apartment is fixed,

12:05.016 --> 12:07.734
she and I
are living here together.

12:07.736 --> 12:09.319
I lived with my old girlfriend.

12:09.321 --> 12:11.354
She was a geologist, too.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.739
Things didn't work out?

12:12.741 --> 12:16.025
I came home from work one day
and she had taken everything.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.527
I'm warning you,

12:17.529 --> 12:20.029
hide your good rocks.

12:21.333 --> 12:24.117
My sister's husband
took all her things, too.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.502
Story at 11:00.

12:28.924 --> 12:30.790
Really, no one else is coming?

12:30.792 --> 12:33.343
Oh, this is it.

12:33.345 --> 12:35.261
You are the practice round.

12:35.263 --> 12:37.046
Practice round? For-for what?

12:37.048 --> 12:39.349
Uh, no.
He-he just means that

12:39.351 --> 12:41.217
you were the first people
we thought of.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.268
You know, exactly.

12:42.270 --> 12:43.553
We've never thrown
a brunch before,

12:43.555 --> 12:45.688
and I wanted to work
out all the kinks.

12:47.192 --> 12:49.025
So, I'm like a lab rat

12:49.027 --> 12:51.194
before your real friends
come over?

12:53.064 --> 12:55.231
Oh.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.066
You see, your words
sound reasonable,

12:57.068 --> 12:58.952
but your face
looks angry.

13:00.455 --> 13:03.123
Help me out here.
This is not where I shine.

13:03.125 --> 13:04.290
Stuart,

13:04.292 --> 13:06.543
you know you're one of
our favorite people.

13:06.545 --> 13:07.911
Okay, now, see,
you look sincere,

13:07.913 --> 13:10.213
but your words are
completely false.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.715
I'm glad we did
this test run.

13:12.717 --> 13:14.467
These brunches
are wild!

13:16.922 --> 13:19.839
But how did you get her
to go out with you?

13:19.841 --> 13:21.591
Well, she moved in
across the hall.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.476
And he started
to slowly wear me down.

13:23.478 --> 13:25.228
Mm-hmm.

13:25.230 --> 13:27.847
Like a river carves a canyon.

13:27.849 --> 13:31.651
Yeah, except the river kept
showing me his Pokémon cards.

13:32.654 --> 13:34.154
Ready to go?

13:34.156 --> 13:35.355
Hang on.
This guy's telling me

13:35.357 --> 13:37.607
how he got the Serial Ape-ist
girl to marry him.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.192
This guy?

13:39.995 --> 13:43.112
But he's wearing
a change maker.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.332
I think it's hot.

13:47.335 --> 13:48.618
That's right.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.670
I'm her change daddy.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.461
What was I thinking?

13:58.463 --> 14:00.964
Wolowitzes are not
a lifting people!

14:00.966 --> 14:02.765
We tip the lifting people!

14:03.969 --> 14:06.686
Do we really
have to sit for hours

14:06.688 --> 14:07.887
in the emergency room?

14:07.889 --> 14:09.606
They're just gonna give you
ice and Advil

14:09.608 --> 14:11.224
like last time.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.476
You're gonna feel terrible
when I'm in a wheelchair.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.480
Which, by the way,
would fit easily in the back

14:17.482 --> 14:19.983
of this award-winning minivan.

14:19.985 --> 14:23.453
Fine, we'll go to the E.R.
Just stop selling me on the van.

14:23.455 --> 14:25.705
You're right. It sells itself.

14:26.741 --> 14:29.492
You have to admit,
it's a pretty smooth ride.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.461
I was hoping it'd be quieter.

14:32.380 --> 14:33.830
If childbirth is half this bad,

14:33.832 --> 14:36.666
you are so screwed!

14:37.836 --> 14:39.469
Are we there yet?!
Soon.

14:39.471 --> 14:41.254
Why is it taking so long?!

14:41.256 --> 14:43.056
H-Howard, Howard,
look at the DVD screen.

14:43.058 --> 14:46.175
I put on Batman: The Animated
Series. Your favorite!

14:46.177 --> 14:48.561
I'm in too much pain
to watch cartoo...

14:48.563 --> 14:51.064
Oh! This is a good one.

14:51.683 --> 14:52.982
I've been babysitting him

14:52.984 --> 14:54.684
way longer than you have.

14:56.238 --> 15:00.023
Fine. I'll buy the stupid van.

15:02.193 --> 15:04.360
This is the best blintz
I've ever had.

15:04.362 --> 15:05.912
Oh. Thank you.

15:05.914 --> 15:08.498
It almost makes up for the
incredibly awkward turn

15:08.500 --> 15:10.533
things took earlier.

15:12.003 --> 15:14.037
You know what,
I-I think I'm just gonna go.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.922
No, Stuart, don't.

15:15.924 --> 15:18.625
No, I-I consider you
and Sheldon like my family,

15:18.627 --> 15:21.127
and I'm not even sure
you think of me as a friend.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.379
You have any idea
how that feels?

15:23.381 --> 15:25.882
We're so sorry.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.051
I'm always the last one
anybody thinks of.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.686
Well, no, that's not true.

15:29.688 --> 15:32.188
I mean, sometimes
it's Koothrappali.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.358
But we're not
supposed to say that 'cause

15:35.360 --> 15:37.393
he's a minority.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.444
Bye.

15:38.446 --> 15:40.563
Stuart, wait.

15:42.033 --> 15:44.784
I do know what it feels like
to be left out.

15:44.786 --> 15:46.402
I know how it feels, too.

15:46.404 --> 15:49.405
All right, this is about me
and him; you're not part of it.

15:51.242 --> 15:54.577
Stuart, perhaps we do
take you for granted,

15:54.579 --> 15:56.379
and that is not acceptable.

15:56.381 --> 15:59.332
Please know that you truly
are a valuable member

15:59.334 --> 16:00.633
of our social group.

16:00.635 --> 16:02.418
Thank you.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.388
You know, in fact,
I'd like to propose a toast.

16:08.893 --> 16:10.009
To Stuart.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.428
A fine man,

16:12.430 --> 16:16.149
a good friend
and a wonderful guest.

16:16.151 --> 16:18.101
Hear, hear.
Cheers.

16:18.103 --> 16:21.821
Cheers. Filmed before
a live studio audience.

16:25.410 --> 16:28.945
And that is how a short
asthmatic scientist

16:28.947 --> 16:31.581
landed a stone cold fox.

16:31.583 --> 16:33.583
Oh. Whoa.

16:35.337 --> 16:37.620
I didn't know you can
propose to the same person

16:37.622 --> 16:39.672
so many times.

16:39.674 --> 16:42.258
The third time,
I did it in skywriting,

16:42.260 --> 16:43.876
but she never looked up.

16:44.679 --> 16:46.429
You know, once,
I proposed to him.

16:46.431 --> 16:48.381
Yeah. I said no.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.716
Why?

16:49.718 --> 16:51.934
I just wanted to
make her work for it.

16:52.721 --> 16:55.638
Yeah, that's gonna
cost you later.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.641
Hang on. Is she just with
you because you're rich?

16:58.643 --> 17:00.560
She makes more
money than I do!

17:00.562 --> 17:02.945
What?! Who are you?!

17:11.828 --> 17:13.911
Do you know
what else I love about you?

17:13.913 --> 17:14.962
Hmm?

17:14.964 --> 17:19.083
Y-Your handwriting
is impeccable!

17:19.085 --> 17:20.334
Thank you for noticing!

17:20.336 --> 17:22.002
No, I mean it. I mean it.

17:22.005 --> 17:25.423
It's like you have
the soul of a label maker.

17:26.275 --> 17:27.926
You know what I
love about you?

17:27.951 --> 17:28.810
Hmm?

17:28.811 --> 17:31.345
You never leave the house
without a paper clip!

17:32.181 --> 17:34.098
You never know
when two pieces of paper

17:34.100 --> 17:37.902
might temporarily need fastening
in the top left corner.

17:41.074 --> 17:44.358
I also love how you
never use swear words.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.776
You know, it turns out,

17:45.778 --> 17:49.914
you can hurt people
just as well without 'em.

17:51.951 --> 17:54.869
Maybe I can get a little help
putting some of this stuff away.

17:54.871 --> 17:56.871
Oh, calm down.

17:56.873 --> 17:59.006
I already put away
five of these!

17:59.008 --> 18:01.542
You see?

18:01.544 --> 18:04.712
No muss, no fuss,
not a single cuss.
