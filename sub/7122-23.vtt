I need your help.
My people are in trouble.

09:10.149 --> 09:11.480
I'm shy.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.610
I mean, he chases us
all up and down,

09:13.686 --> 09:15.586
from first base to home.

09:15.655 --> 09:17.282
We've always managed
to escape.

09:17.356 --> 09:18.618
Getting anything?

09:18.691 --> 09:20.522
Yeah, but it's hard
to make out.

09:20.593 --> 09:21.582
I'm shy.

09:21.661 --> 09:22.685
First base.

09:22.762 --> 09:24.161
Yeah, but it's hard
to make out.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.221
- I'm shy.
- It's hard to make out.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.233
Hmm. That's it!

09:28.301 --> 09:29.928
Jake, wait!

09:30.002 --> 09:31.264
[Grunts]

09:31.337 --> 09:33.328
[Grunts]
Sick, dude!

09:33.406 --> 09:34.395
Huh?

09:34.473 --> 09:36.100
I know how to stop him!

09:36.175 --> 09:37.437
[Grunting]

09:37.510 --> 09:41.276
[Panting]

09:41.347 --> 09:42.939
Nyah chow!

09:43.015 --> 09:46.109
[Creak!]

09:46.185 --> 09:50.121
[Roars]

09:50.189 --> 09:52.180
[Smooch!]

09:57.463 --> 10:00.899
[Smack!]

10:00.967 --> 10:05.063
[Warble!]

10:05.137 --> 10:07.935
[Shing!]

10:16.282 --> 10:19.217
[Warble!]

10:19.285 --> 10:22.550
[Sloop!]

10:22.622 --> 10:27.059
[Shing! Shing!]

10:27.126 --> 10:28.718

10:28.794 --> 10:29.726

10:29.795 --> 10:30.887

10:30.963 --> 10:34.899
[Whoosh! Zing!]

10:34.967 --> 10:38.459
[Shing!]

10:38.537 --> 10:40.528
Aah! This is rad!

10:40.606 --> 10:42.597
I'm hot again!

10:42.675 --> 10:44.336
Thanks, little dudes!

10:44.410 --> 10:47.208
I <i>really</i> appreciate it.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.270
I don't get it, though.

10:49.348 --> 10:52.374
I kissed just about everything
I could get my lips on.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.476
How come it only worked
with you?

10:54.553 --> 10:56.919
You can't break your
own curse by kissing somebody.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.890
Somebody's gotta kiss you.
- Oh. Weird.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.654
Well, thanks, man.

11:01.727 --> 11:04.958
I don't know a lot of dudes
who'd do that to help a guy out.

11:05.031 --> 11:06.055
Whatevs.

11:06.132 --> 11:09.795
