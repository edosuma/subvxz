WEBVTT

00:10.155 --> 00:13.710
Ugh. Damn near 5:30.

00:14.060 --> 00:15.842
Just can't get back
to sleep.

00:16.233 --> 00:19.334
Told you. You got to lay
off the caffeine after supper.

00:19.943 --> 00:21.678
It isn't the caffeine.

00:21.803 --> 00:24.616
It's my mind. Something
just doesn't feel right.

00:26.030 --> 00:27.467
Let me know
when sleeping under

00:27.555 --> 00:29.125
a bridge starts
feeling normal.

00:31.108 --> 00:32.788
Here comes
the morning traffic.

00:33.147 --> 00:34.915
Might as well
get a start on the day.

00:36.068 --> 00:37.491
You got it.

00:38.608 --> 00:40.002
Time is money.

00:41.913 --> 00:44.278
Let no one
ever accuse us

00:44.366 --> 00:46.274
of losing our work ethic.

00:46.361 --> 00:48.702
What
the hell was that?

00:50.099 --> 00:51.381
Oh, God! Oh!

00:55.109 --> 00:56.350
Oh, God.

01:35.928 --> 01:37.631
Ellie,
geez, lighten up.

01:37.719 --> 01:38.843
You didn't have
to bite my head off.

01:38.930 --> 01:40.500
I wasn't biting
your head off.

01:40.588 --> 01:42.590
Felt like a bite.
Wasn't a bite.

01:42.678 --> 01:44.301
- Sounds like a fight.
- Nope.

01:44.389 --> 01:46.559
Nobody is fighting
or biting.

01:46.647 --> 01:47.764
I had the audacity

01:47.852 --> 01:49.648
to tell Miss Cranky-Pants
over here about my...

01:49.735 --> 01:51.616
killer workout in the gym.

01:51.704 --> 01:54.600
All I said was,
"No bragging before my coffee,"

01:54.688 --> 01:56.661
which doesn't
make me cranky,

01:56.749 --> 01:58.295
just not quite awake.

01:58.383 --> 01:59.906
You're not sleeping, either?

02:00.134 --> 02:01.624
Why? You, too?

02:01.712 --> 02:03.795
It's kind of hard to sleep
ever since...

02:03.992 --> 02:05.994
Since... the Gibbs thing?

02:06.119 --> 02:07.795
What Gibbs thing?

02:07.985 --> 02:09.366
You know,
the thing he told us,

02:09.454 --> 02:11.772
that we all agreed
not to talk about again.

02:13.796 --> 02:15.772
Oh, please, come on.

02:16.674 --> 02:17.959
It's nothing.

02:18.872 --> 02:19.889
Seriously?

02:19.960 --> 02:21.006
Killing a man

02:21.094 --> 02:22.965
in cold blood
is nothing?

02:23.053 --> 02:24.489
It's not just any man.

02:24.693 --> 02:26.983
He killed the man
who killed his family.

02:27.071 --> 02:29.247
- Same thing any of us would do.
- Yeah,

02:29.335 --> 02:30.989
would want to do.

02:31.077 --> 02:33.184
- But in reality...
- See, now I just keep wondering

02:33.272 --> 02:34.707
what he expects us
to do about it.

02:34.795 --> 02:35.827
What do you mean, do?

02:35.915 --> 02:37.944
He didn't tell us
so we would do anything.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.077
Gibbs has been
doing nothing

02:39.164 --> 02:41.241
for years.
Look, all I'm saying is,

02:41.329 --> 02:43.155
if he's unfazed,
maybe we should be, too.

02:43.243 --> 02:44.827
But that's the thing.
He's not unfazed.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.874
If anything,
he is extremely fazed.

02:46.962 --> 02:49.254
He's been so much
quieter lately.

02:49.342 --> 02:51.045
Yes, quiet and distracted.

02:51.133 --> 02:52.874
Gibbs is always quiet.

02:52.985 --> 02:54.914
The only ones 
distracted are you two.

02:55.397 --> 02:57.084
Just forget it, all right?

02:57.256 --> 02:58.733
Forget what?

02:58.928 --> 03:01.132
I... forgot.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.379
Dead Marine in Reston.

03:09.827 --> 03:11.229
Grab your gear.
Let's go.

03:16.194 --> 03:17.238
Well, no wallet,

03:17.326 --> 03:19.450
no keys, but police
I.D.'d the victim

03:19.538 --> 03:22.403
as Marine Gunnery Sergeant
Richard Wilson, which, uh,

03:22.491 --> 03:24.788
sounds kind of familiar
to me for some reason.

03:25.186 --> 03:26.577
- Palmer.
- Yeah, I'll know more

03:26.670 --> 03:27.812
when I get him down,
but he does have

03:27.899 --> 03:29.405
two gunshot
wounds to the chest.

03:29.493 --> 03:31.253
He was dead
before he hit that spike.

03:31.716 --> 03:33.624
- I hope.
- Yeah, me, too.

03:33.717 --> 03:36.256
Talk about being hoisted
on your own petard, huh?

03:36.689 --> 03:38.131
- Ouch.
- Hey.

03:38.229 --> 03:39.883
I found skid marks.
Up there.

03:40.033 --> 03:42.194
Likely from whatever vehicle
the witnesses heard.

03:42.282 --> 03:44.999
Says here Wilson was just three
months shy of retirement.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.460
Married, no kids.
Lives nearby in Sterling.

03:47.548 --> 03:49.729
Want us to, uh, head over
to the house, Gibbs?

03:52.487 --> 03:53.780
Boss?

03:54.733 --> 03:56.332
Boss, we have the
victim's address.

03:56.420 --> 03:57.710
You want us
to head over?

03:57.936 --> 03:59.364
Yeah.

03:59.710 --> 04:01.491
Bishop, Torres, go.

04:07.420 --> 04:08.656
How could you
not have seen that?

04:08.743 --> 04:10.647
Gibbs is clearly distracted.

04:10.741 --> 04:12.372
Yeah, by the poor guy

04:12.460 --> 04:14.215
hanging upside down
on that fence.

04:14.303 --> 04:15.747
- Nick.
- Hey, by the way,

04:15.835 --> 04:17.678
if the guy's wife is here,

04:17.803 --> 04:19.858
I would really appreciate
you making the notification.

04:19.946 --> 04:22.575
What? Why me?
No, I hate delivering the bad news,

04:22.663 --> 04:23.921
- and you never do it.
- That's because

04:24.008 --> 04:24.942
I'm really bad at it.

04:25.030 --> 04:26.911
You have such
a gentle touch, to go

04:26.999 --> 04:29.434
- with that big heart of yours.
- Okay, stop buttering me up.

04:29.522 --> 04:30.897
I'm not doing it.
It's your turn.

04:30.985 --> 04:33.070
Big-hearted Bishop... that's what
I'm gonna call you from now on.

04:33.157 --> 04:35.647
Okay. Whoa.
Hold on.

04:45.279 --> 04:46.428
Whoa.

04:46.516 --> 04:48.847
What kind of tornado
swept through here?

04:49.006 --> 04:51.590
Maybe the same tornado
that shot our victim.

04:57.639 --> 04:59.468
- Get out! I'm calling the cops!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:59.555 --> 05:00.948
- NCIS!
- Drop the bat!

05:01.119 --> 05:03.374
Oh, God. Oh, dear God.

05:03.462 --> 05:05.156
- Mrs. Wilson?
- I just walked in

05:05.244 --> 05:06.376
a minute ago.

05:06.464 --> 05:07.842
What the hell happened?

05:08.033 --> 05:09.452
- You don't know?
- Know what?

05:09.540 --> 05:10.795
How would I know?

05:11.038 --> 05:12.387
I've been at my
mother's in Florida.

05:12.474 --> 05:14.440
I... I took a cab
from the airport.

05:14.528 --> 05:16.269
What is this?
What happened here?

05:16.357 --> 05:17.686
Where's my husband?

05:19.189 --> 05:20.495
Where's Rick?

05:21.912 --> 05:23.592
Someone tell me.

05:27.788 --> 05:30.170
I'm sorry, uh,
Mrs. Wilson,

05:30.258 --> 05:31.460
I'm afraid, um...

05:32.960 --> 05:35.424
Agent Torres has
some bad news for you.

05:45.317 --> 05:48.146
The man survived
how many war zones?

05:48.301 --> 05:51.121
Only to be killed
in some stupid robbery.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.278
Makes no sense.

05:53.615 --> 05:55.465
Any idea what they
were looking for?

05:55.602 --> 05:57.231
Something of value?

05:57.605 --> 05:59.970
Not on Rick's
military pay.

06:00.395 --> 06:02.067
And my temp jobs?

06:02.434 --> 06:04.864
Hundred bucks or so
in our cookie jar.

06:05.011 --> 06:07.285
Other than that,
I'm sure they left disappointed.

06:07.508 --> 06:09.494
Your husband,
he have any enemies?

06:09.582 --> 06:10.632
Sure.

06:10.720 --> 06:11.938
Afghanistan.

06:12.126 --> 06:13.465
But not here.

06:14.059 --> 06:18.168
Rick was a complicated man,
but... everyone liked him.

06:18.942 --> 06:20.002
Complicated?

06:20.090 --> 06:21.239
Oh,
not in a bad way.

06:21.327 --> 06:22.785
Just...

06:23.379 --> 06:24.573
quiet.

06:25.144 --> 06:26.212
To a fault,

06:26.300 --> 06:27.825
some days.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.494
It's not easy living with...

06:30.581 --> 06:32.246
the strong, silent type,

06:32.407 --> 06:33.973
especially when
it comes to his job.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.062
Why is that?

06:35.150 --> 06:37.021
I guess he had seen
some bad things.

06:37.629 --> 06:40.660
Lost a couple buddies in that
big raid that made him a hero.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.910
- I'm sorry, what raid?
- It was his unit

06:43.035 --> 06:45.575
that caught that
big terrorist leader about...

06:45.932 --> 06:47.325
five years ago.

06:47.793 --> 06:50.077
Zakir somebody.

06:51.239 --> 06:53.403
I don't recall that,
but, uh...

06:53.514 --> 06:56.043
I couldn't tell you
much past what made the news.

06:56.130 --> 06:57.305
Any time I asked,

06:57.393 --> 06:58.699
Rick turned into...

06:58.903 --> 07:01.348
John Wayne...
Like it was some big secret.

07:01.562 --> 07:03.371
So many secrets.

07:13.027 --> 07:14.457
Was it something I said?

07:18.712 --> 07:20.003
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

07:20.094 --> 07:21.226
Boss!

07:21.314 --> 07:22.533
Hey, boss,

07:22.621 --> 07:24.652
I knew his name
sounded familiar.

07:24.940 --> 07:26.722
He's one
of the Zakir-Five.

07:26.810 --> 07:29.683
Named for Taliban
leader Nazar Zakir.

07:29.841 --> 07:31.009
Gunnery Sergeant Wilson

07:31.097 --> 07:32.503
led the unit
that captured him.

07:32.591 --> 07:34.972
- Yeah. Just heard.
- They also rescued hostages

07:35.060 --> 07:37.652
and recovered $30 million
in stolen cash

07:37.740 --> 07:38.652
from Zakir's bunker.

07:38.740 --> 07:40.239
Two Marines
were killed in the raid,

07:40.326 --> 07:43.105
leaving only Wilson and two
others from the original five.

07:43.193 --> 07:44.394
Anything else?

07:45.410 --> 07:47.019
Well, we were
about to start combing

07:47.107 --> 07:49.022
- through Wilson's cell phone records.
- Okay.

07:49.110 --> 07:50.154
Good.

07:50.526 --> 07:51.615
Hey.

07:51.703 --> 07:53.207
Nick told me
about your victim.

07:53.302 --> 07:54.653
Are we talking
about the Zakir-Five?

07:54.740 --> 07:56.207
- You remember them, too?
- Mm.

07:56.295 --> 07:57.808
They should have been
a bigger story,

07:57.896 --> 07:59.376
but the 24-hour news cycle,

07:59.472 --> 08:01.949
they just chewed it up
in less than a day.

08:02.037 --> 08:04.144
You ran out of there
kind of quick there, Gibbs.

08:04.232 --> 08:05.822
- You doing all right?
- Where you headed?

08:05.909 --> 08:07.839
I'm going to get
the widow's suitcase

08:07.927 --> 08:09.497
out of my car...
We're keeping her here a while.

08:09.584 --> 08:11.027
Man, talk about heroes.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.878
Guys like Wilson
deserve better.

08:13.028 --> 08:14.261
Gibbs?

08:16.246 --> 08:17.415
Was it something I said?

08:17.503 --> 08:18.818
Yeah, he's been getting that
a lot today.

08:18.905 --> 08:20.580
Yeah, have you, uh,
not noticed

08:20.668 --> 08:21.996
something off
about Gibbs lately?

08:22.121 --> 08:23.457
I can't say
that I have.

08:23.550 --> 08:26.402
And before you go and open
that gigantic can of worms,

08:26.490 --> 08:29.605
I'm late for the dentist,
so... catch ya later.

08:32.652 --> 08:33.964
Agent Gibbs.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.222
Yeah, I thought I heard
someone out here.

08:36.519 --> 08:38.270
You all right?

08:38.988 --> 08:41.543
Oh. Yeah.
Turns out I was right.

08:41.746 --> 08:44.955
Two bullets to the chest to go
along with the spike wound.

08:45.043 --> 08:47.103
Oh.
And... speaking of which,

08:47.191 --> 08:49.798
I completely misused the term
"hoisted on his own petard"

08:49.886 --> 08:50.931
earlier this morning.

08:51.019 --> 08:52.345
Apparently, it's
a common mistake,

08:52.433 --> 08:54.423
from thinking that
the petard is a spear

08:54.511 --> 08:56.382
that one could
get hoisted upon.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.570
Whereas, actually,
it is an explosive

08:58.658 --> 09:00.187
that happens to go
off too early.

09:00.275 --> 09:02.663
From that, Shakespeare meant
it as someone who gets caught

09:02.751 --> 09:03.900
in his own web of lies.

09:03.988 --> 09:05.017
Whose web of lies?

09:05.105 --> 09:07.017
- What?
- Why are you telling me this?

09:07.167 --> 09:08.995
What are you getting at, Palmer?

09:09.596 --> 09:10.923
Oh. Gibbs.

09:11.011 --> 09:12.306
What do youwant now?

09:12.410 --> 09:14.993
Uh, McGee was looking
for you, and...

09:15.081 --> 09:16.158
What does he
want?

09:16.246 --> 09:18.376
To tell you that our victim
received three calls

09:18.464 --> 09:20.158
within ten minutes
late last night

09:20.337 --> 09:22.798
from a retired Marine
from his old unit, the...

09:22.886 --> 09:25.056
- Zephyr... the Zipper...
- Yeah.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.622
- And?
- And McGee got

09:26.710 --> 09:28.126
no answer
from that number...

09:28.214 --> 09:29.338
so he and Bishop and Torres

09:29.425 --> 09:31.308
are headed over
to the guy's place now,

09:31.396 --> 09:33.228
- if you want to...
- I will meet you there!

09:36.399 --> 09:37.978
Was it something you said?

09:42.180 --> 09:44.182
Staff Sergeant
Jordan McCarthy?

09:44.270 --> 09:45.673
NCIS!

09:50.126 --> 09:51.734
The landlord thinks
he had a girlfriend

09:51.822 --> 09:53.056
living here until recently.

09:53.144 --> 09:55.837
Appearances to the contrary.

10:04.008 --> 10:06.189
Gibbs, what
do you think?

10:06.626 --> 10:09.205
You haven't really,
uh, said a word.

10:12.701 --> 10:14.212
I hope you know that...

10:14.322 --> 10:16.494
Hey, guys? We got blood.

10:22.931 --> 10:25.548
No sign of Staff
Sergeant McCarthy.

10:25.636 --> 10:28.447
If this is his, we may have
ourselves a second victim.

10:28.535 --> 10:30.510
Well, and if we do,
I'll bet this has something to do

10:30.597 --> 10:32.146
with that Zakir guy
they captured.

10:32.255 --> 10:34.936
Wilson's unit left a lot
of enemies out there.

10:35.209 --> 10:36.358
And if there is a connection,

10:36.445 --> 10:38.514
that leaves one of
the remaining five

10:38.602 --> 10:40.551
- still alive out there.
- We better find him.

10:40.639 --> 10:41.989
And fast.

10:43.969 --> 10:45.575
Boss?

10:49.129 --> 10:50.340
What is he doing?

10:50.435 --> 10:51.346
Hey.

10:51.434 --> 10:52.691
Gibbs!

11:07.598 --> 11:08.708
Still no word?

11:08.796 --> 11:11.104
Nothing. We've even had the
park rangers check his cabin.

11:11.192 --> 11:12.645
Well, no sign of him
at his house,

11:12.733 --> 11:14.146
and he's not answering
his cell, either.

11:14.233 --> 11:15.857
Well, I mean, McGee,
you've been here the longest.

11:15.944 --> 11:17.903
Has Gibbs ever walked away
from a crime scene?

11:17.991 --> 11:19.736
No. Never. Not like this.

11:19.824 --> 11:22.228
Are you sure
we shouldn't tell Vance?

11:22.817 --> 11:24.189
Not yet.

11:24.405 --> 11:26.320
No, let's give Gibbs
some more time here.

11:26.408 --> 11:28.280
Besides, we still have
a job to do.

11:28.865 --> 11:31.228
Okay. Uh, the remaining three

11:31.316 --> 11:33.709
of the Zakir-Five... our victim,

11:33.797 --> 11:36.287
Rick Wilson, possible
victim Jordan McCarthy,

11:36.375 --> 11:38.931
and we're still looking
for Staff Sergeant John Calfa.

11:39.019 --> 11:41.470
VA is, uh, getting us
his current address.

11:41.980 --> 11:43.982
That might be it.

11:44.196 --> 11:45.485
How's Wilson's wife?

11:45.616 --> 11:47.369
She's upstairs.
Not happy about it,

11:47.457 --> 11:48.588
but understands protocol.

11:48.676 --> 11:49.823
I mean, does she know
these two at all?

11:49.910 --> 11:52.086
She knows who they are,
but they've never met.

11:52.174 --> 11:54.877
Okay, we have got
Calfa's address in Arlington.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.197
- It's not far.
- Great.

11:56.322 --> 11:57.729
Would you two mind
going and getting him?

11:57.816 --> 11:59.600
I'm-I'm completely exhausted.

11:59.688 --> 12:01.525
Oh, come on, Tim.
You can do better than that.

12:01.689 --> 12:03.720
- Go scoop him up!
- All right!

12:04.001 --> 12:06.713
Attaboy.
Spoken like a true boss.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.916
Wherever the hell he is.

12:19.064 --> 12:21.617
Of all the gin joints, Popeye,

12:21.705 --> 12:23.338
you drag me to this one?

12:23.470 --> 12:25.335
- What took you so long?
- Oh, yeah.

12:25.423 --> 12:26.955
It's nice to see you, too.

12:29.454 --> 12:30.759
Oh.

12:30.877 --> 12:32.830
What the hell do
you call that?

12:33.041 --> 12:36.298
Necessary. Where you been?

12:37.001 --> 12:37.978
Well, for one thing,

12:38.066 --> 12:41.189
my Uber driver could barely
find this... establishment.

12:41.608 --> 12:43.642
Not to mention,
I was mid-session

12:43.730 --> 12:45.447
with another patient
when you called.

12:45.535 --> 12:48.146
Had to leave her on
the verge of a breakthrough.

12:48.306 --> 12:49.310
Want a beer?

12:49.398 --> 12:50.806
No, I never day-drink.

12:50.894 --> 12:52.809
Well, not never,

12:53.129 --> 12:55.000
but never on
a workday.

12:55.251 --> 12:57.341
And from the looks of that beer,
neither do you.

12:58.799 --> 13:00.634
So talk to me.

13:00.897 --> 13:02.994
What's the big emergency?

13:04.975 --> 13:06.324
Rule Four.

13:06.684 --> 13:08.686
Ah, the famous
Gibbs rules.

13:08.774 --> 13:12.009
Lucky you...
I brought my Gibbs notebook.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.025
"The best way to keep a secret

13:15.689 --> 13:17.595
is to keep it to yourself."

13:21.776 --> 13:23.353
Hey.

13:25.127 --> 13:26.747
Look at me.

13:28.954 --> 13:30.880
You're barely hanging on.

13:31.572 --> 13:32.642
All right, got it.

13:32.730 --> 13:36.212
Okay, then, so... secrets.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.697
Who are we talking about?

13:39.627 --> 13:41.447
Are you sure
you don't want a beer?

13:44.877 --> 13:46.361
But how could
Rick be dead?

13:46.449 --> 13:48.625
And-and you think
McCarthy now, too?

13:48.986 --> 13:51.611
Well, we, uh... we won't know
until we find him.

13:51.754 --> 13:55.002
When was the last time you spoke
to either of them, Mr. Calfa?

13:55.275 --> 13:58.002
Uh, spoke to both
just last month.

13:58.310 --> 14:00.242
This annual phone call
we all do

14:00.330 --> 14:01.810
on the anniversary of the raid.

14:02.163 --> 14:03.620
It's an achievement
worth remembering.

14:03.707 --> 14:05.927
It was more
to remember the guys we lost.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.503
You know, survivor's guilt,
I guess you'd call it.

14:09.634 --> 14:11.548
Yeah, none of us liked
talking about it much.

14:11.636 --> 14:13.705
So Rick wasn't
the only quiet one.

14:13.793 --> 14:14.897
<i>They were good men.</i>

14:14.985 --> 14:17.384
Can you verify these annual
phone calls, Mrs. Wilson?

14:17.735 --> 14:21.235
Well, I didn't realize
they were annual calls,

14:21.323 --> 14:23.830
but I sure remember
the last one.

14:23.926 --> 14:26.775
- What about it?
- Let's just say it got loud.

14:27.025 --> 14:28.541
Even from behind
closed doors.

14:28.629 --> 14:30.108
Loud, as in an argument?

14:30.252 --> 14:33.689
Mm. About what,
I couldn't tell you.

14:34.337 --> 14:37.158
But it's probably why I
never met these guys before.

14:37.275 --> 14:39.337
I'm not sure they
got along too well.

14:40.298 --> 14:42.509
<i>We were proud to
take down that bastard.</i>

14:45.868 --> 14:47.181
Excuse me.

14:48.350 --> 14:49.917
Am I in danger?

14:50.243 --> 14:51.454
We hope not.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.822
But if your friend McCarthy
does turn up dead,

14:53.910 --> 14:57.806
I'm afraid we've got to assume
a connection to Nazar Zakir.

14:58.236 --> 15:00.095
Isn't he still locked up
in Gitmo?

15:00.183 --> 15:01.220
He is,

15:01.308 --> 15:02.689
but as you probably
know,

15:02.777 --> 15:04.892
demagogues like him
have a knack

15:05.008 --> 15:07.663
for attracting
unstable devotees.

15:07.945 --> 15:12.353
So, this be might be some kind
of revenge for capturing Zakir?

15:12.722 --> 15:14.673
Yeah, that,
or it could be personal.

15:14.838 --> 15:17.087
Personal? How?
What do you mean?

15:17.175 --> 15:19.356
Well, we understand that
you and your buddies

15:19.444 --> 15:21.262
may have had
some issues.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.629
Who told you that?

15:22.717 --> 15:25.023
What matters is
whether it's true.

15:25.157 --> 15:26.926
Whether we had issues?

15:28.421 --> 15:29.683
Who doesn't?

15:30.075 --> 15:31.660
Look, we'd been through
a lot together,

15:31.748 --> 15:33.744
but I'm not gonna sit here
and say we were bosom buddies.

15:33.831 --> 15:35.235
That's kind of odd,
because usually

15:35.323 --> 15:36.893
combat has a bonding effect.

15:36.981 --> 15:38.471
Not everyone bonds the same.

15:38.559 --> 15:40.839
What did you guys argue about
in your last phone call?

15:41.849 --> 15:43.758
I don't know.
It-it was personal,

15:43.846 --> 15:45.862
but I... I don't like
where this is going.

15:46.206 --> 15:47.727
We're just...
we're just talking.

15:47.815 --> 15:48.628
No, you're not.

15:48.716 --> 15:50.066
You're implying something
I would never do.

15:50.153 --> 15:51.557
And what's that?

15:51.780 --> 15:54.448
I had my fill
of killing over there, okay?

15:54.536 --> 15:56.625
Me, Rick and Jordan...
Did we argue? Sure.

15:56.713 --> 15:58.149
What about? I hardly remember,

15:58.416 --> 16:00.792
but it was nothing
I would kill my brothers over.

16:00.880 --> 16:01.910
Now they're your brothers.

16:01.997 --> 16:03.687
Damn right!
And brothers fight.

16:03.775 --> 16:05.753
Okay, let's just
take a breath, all right?

16:05.841 --> 16:07.760
I can't decide
if he's being sincere,

16:07.848 --> 16:09.471
or if he's
protesting too much.

16:09.559 --> 16:11.706
- And now I feel bad.
- Don't.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.175
He sounds
guilty to me.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.745
I'm not sure that he is.

16:14.833 --> 16:16.155
- What do you have, Ms. Hines?
- An I.D.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.201
off the blood found
in McCarthy's apartment.

16:18.289 --> 16:20.597
We assumed
it belonged to McCarthy.

16:20.685 --> 16:22.701
Turns out it was a match
to our original victim.

16:22.939 --> 16:24.638
You're saying
it was Rick's?

16:25.341 --> 16:26.981
What was he doing
at McCarthy's place?

16:27.069 --> 16:28.951
Will you excuse us,
Mrs. Wilson?

16:36.279 --> 16:38.083
In the future, Ms. Hines,

16:38.171 --> 16:40.131
let's not disclose
sensitive information like that

16:40.218 --> 16:42.006
in front of the victim's
next of kin, shall we?

16:42.093 --> 16:44.154
I am so sorry, Director.

16:44.242 --> 16:45.936
Well, now we know that
McCarthy's our suspect,

16:46.023 --> 16:46.794
and not this guy.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.318
Let's offer
Mr. Calfa protection.

16:48.406 --> 16:50.930
Let's put a BOLO
on that McCarthy fellow.

16:52.152 --> 16:54.560
Heroes being murdered
back home.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.724
Living on a shoestring.

16:57.812 --> 17:02.164
Homeless vets...
sleeping under highways.

17:02.758 --> 17:04.039
It's not fair.

17:04.128 --> 17:06.352
You can spend the
next hour, Popeye,

17:06.440 --> 17:08.867
listing life's
many injustices,

17:09.023 --> 17:11.883
but what does that have
to do with keeping secrets?

17:11.978 --> 17:15.414
Mm. Scotty,
can I get a cold one, please?

17:15.563 --> 17:16.714
Gibbs.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.023
I did something

17:21.298 --> 17:22.859
a long time ago

17:24.016 --> 17:25.688
that was outside the law.

17:25.776 --> 17:27.430
Be still,
my beating heart.

17:28.060 --> 17:29.148
You wanted to know.

17:29.236 --> 17:31.797
Yeah, and my expectations
let me down once again.

17:33.188 --> 17:37.078
But according to the
rest of Rule Four here,

17:37.166 --> 17:38.891
"The second best way
to keep a secret is

17:38.979 --> 17:42.557
to tell one other person,
and the third..."

17:42.645 --> 17:43.625
"There is no third best."

17:43.713 --> 17:46.585
- Yeah. You know your rules.
- I wrote my rules.

17:46.673 --> 17:49.352
So, who else have you told
this big secret to besides me?

17:49.440 --> 17:51.964
Besides you,
I followed the rule at first.

17:52.052 --> 17:53.402
I told only
one person.

17:53.599 --> 17:55.250
- Thank you.
- And then?

17:55.712 --> 17:59.141
And then, last week,
I had to tell my team.

18:00.337 --> 18:01.633
My three best agents.

18:01.721 --> 18:03.897
- Why did you tell them?
- Because they needed to know.

18:04.181 --> 18:05.530
- And now I don't...
- Now?

18:05.618 --> 18:06.571
Now, I don't know.

18:06.659 --> 18:08.095
Well, of course you do.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.874
Now that they know,
has the world come to an end?

18:10.962 --> 18:13.742
- It sure doesn't feel the same to me.
- Oh. How does it feel?

18:14.359 --> 18:16.492
I trained my people

18:16.634 --> 18:19.332
to take responsibility
for their actions.

18:20.047 --> 18:22.860
And here I am,
not taking it,

18:23.259 --> 18:24.875
throwing it right back
in their face.

18:24.963 --> 18:26.791
Oh.
It's about integrity.

18:26.879 --> 18:29.787
Yeah, it's about integrity,
it's about character,

18:29.961 --> 18:30.998
it's about all of it.

18:31.101 --> 18:33.327
- All important things to you.
- Yes. Yes.

18:33.618 --> 18:35.124
The only things
I have left.

18:35.212 --> 18:37.795
Oh, baloney.
So where does that leave you?

18:37.883 --> 18:38.842
What are you gonna
do now?

18:38.930 --> 18:40.932
Are you gonna turn yourself
into the authorities?

18:41.020 --> 18:43.197
Will that square things
with the integrity gods?

18:43.285 --> 18:44.639
It's what's fair.

18:45.067 --> 18:47.244
- What? I was just kidding.
- I'm not.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.007
Hold on.
Is that why you called me here?

18:49.094 --> 18:50.574
To talk you out of
turning yourself in?

18:50.657 --> 18:53.170
Yeah, or you can drop me off
at the police station.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.850
- It's a block from here.
- Police station? Why not NCIS?

18:55.938 --> 18:57.342
No, the police station.

18:57.430 --> 18:59.129
I can't even believe we're
having this conversation.

18:59.216 --> 19:00.468
You are actually
considering turning

19:00.555 --> 19:02.585
- yourself in?
- I'm way past considering.

19:02.673 --> 19:05.358
For some outside-the-law thing
you did a million years ago?

19:05.446 --> 19:06.921
It's more like 30.

19:08.166 --> 19:10.374
Oh, my God, you really
want to do this.

19:10.462 --> 19:12.639
Yeah. I have to.

19:23.273 --> 19:25.202
John Calfa declined our offer

19:25.296 --> 19:27.021
of protection, Director,
but he knows not to go anywhere.

19:27.108 --> 19:29.020
- And the BOLO on McCarthy?
- No hits just yet.

19:29.108 --> 19:31.538
- Only a matter of time.
- No prior criminal record,

19:31.626 --> 19:34.421
but McCarthy hasn't exactly
thrived since retirement.

19:34.581 --> 19:36.717
In and out of work,
a few sobriety programs.

19:36.828 --> 19:38.381
Yup, that would fit
his profile.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.342
Director?

19:39.433 --> 19:40.829
I recently spoke
with General Coyne.

19:40.916 --> 19:42.788
He was the commander
of that Zakir mission.

19:42.876 --> 19:45.705
He had nothing but praise for
his men, but he did point out

19:45.793 --> 19:48.361
that McCarthy was a bit of loose
cannon... prone to bad judgment,

19:48.449 --> 19:50.058
impulsive choices.

19:50.146 --> 19:52.425
Impulsive enough
to kill, Director?

19:52.513 --> 19:54.516
Well, you do know how to make
an entrance, Dr. Mallard.

19:54.603 --> 19:56.036
- What you got, Ducky?
- Yes, well, I dug

19:56.123 --> 19:58.847
through the archives
for anything I could find

19:58.935 --> 20:01.996
on the Zakir raid,
and I discovered

20:02.112 --> 20:05.650
after his capture,
the Taliban leader insisted

20:05.738 --> 20:09.175
that he had
$33 million stashed away,

20:09.263 --> 20:10.923
and not the mere 30

20:11.011 --> 20:14.062
that was turned
in by these men.

20:15.379 --> 20:17.849
They denied the allegation,
of course,

20:17.949 --> 20:19.621
and the Pentagon saw it

20:19.709 --> 20:21.683
as a weak attempt for Zakir

20:21.771 --> 20:25.144
to discredit his captors, so,

20:25.371 --> 20:27.554
no investigation
was ever launched.

20:27.641 --> 20:29.449
So a discrepancy
of $3 million.

20:29.537 --> 20:31.278
- Alleged discrepancy.
- But if

20:31.375 --> 20:32.972
one needed a motive

20:33.159 --> 20:35.683
to eliminate one's accomplices,

20:35.771 --> 20:40.699
I imagine even an alleged
$3 million might suffice.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.963
Now, where the devil is Jethro?

20:50.447 --> 20:55.363
<i>♪ Honesty ♪</i>

20:55.605 --> 20:59.074
<i>♪ Is such a lonely word ♪</i>

20:59.254 --> 21:03.011
<i>♪ Everyone is so untrue... ♪</i>

21:03.160 --> 21:06.289
Kind of romantic
in a... boozy way.

21:06.621 --> 21:09.363
♪ Honesty... ♪

21:09.496 --> 21:10.855
I'm ready. Let's go.

21:10.943 --> 21:13.207
Whoa. No, you're not ready,
and we're not going.

21:13.295 --> 21:15.027
Yeah, you can drive
my truck. Come on.

21:15.115 --> 21:19.254
You didn't call me to drive you.
You called me to talk, so talk.

21:19.885 --> 21:22.216
- About what?
- Ah, you're so infuriating.

21:22.304 --> 21:24.991
About the thing that you did
a million years ago.

21:25.079 --> 21:27.639
Why now? Why, all of a sudden,
after all this time,

21:27.727 --> 21:28.991
you grow a conscience?

21:29.079 --> 21:30.791
The guilt's finally
catching up with you?

21:30.878 --> 21:33.838
Wait. Wait. I-I never
felt guilty. I still don't.

21:33.977 --> 21:37.110
What I did...
Needed doing.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.855
So you feel justified.
Why turn yourself in?

21:40.110 --> 21:43.325
For 30 years, no one knew.

21:43.641 --> 21:44.946
Like it never happened.

21:45.034 --> 21:47.503
- But now that your secret's out...
- Now that it's out,

21:47.591 --> 21:48.930
how do they look at it?

21:50.126 --> 21:51.421
What do they think of me?

21:51.508 --> 21:53.087
Since when do you care
what people think?

21:53.174 --> 21:54.795
I've always cared
what they think of me.

21:54.883 --> 21:56.788
Well, what might they think?
That you're.

21:56.876 --> 21:58.172
Worse yet, do youfeel
you're a bad person?

21:58.259 --> 21:59.734
- A bad person?
- I arrested I hundreds

21:59.821 --> 22:01.868
of bad people
doing bad things.

22:01.956 --> 22:04.602
They all had justification
for what they did, just like me.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.758
And that makes you
just like them?

22:06.846 --> 22:09.100
- It makes me no different.
- I see.

22:09.451 --> 22:10.704
Okay, Gibbs.

22:10.831 --> 22:13.238
Lay it on me,
this justification,

22:13.326 --> 22:16.315
whatever you did
that was so outside the law.

22:16.678 --> 22:18.709
Who'd you kill and why?

22:19.536 --> 22:20.866
Who said I killed anyone?

22:20.954 --> 22:23.991
Would we be sitting here
if you pirated someone's cable?

22:32.157 --> 22:33.483
I killed a man.

22:35.873 --> 22:37.022
You've killed before.

22:37.110 --> 22:38.616
Before I was an agent.

22:39.435 --> 22:40.572
I killed him.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.100
I shot him long-range

22:43.298 --> 22:44.834
in cold blood

22:45.764 --> 22:49.709
for killing my wife and
killing my daughter.

23:01.527 --> 23:03.529
You got any good scotch?

23:06.187 --> 23:09.229
Hey. How was the dentist?

23:09.317 --> 23:11.500
What? Uh, oh, fine.

23:11.588 --> 23:13.128
Just a cleaning.

23:13.216 --> 23:15.251
Ooh, nothing like
a good teeth cleaning.

23:15.339 --> 23:17.289
You know that feeling
when you rub your tongue

23:17.377 --> 23:18.869
on the inside
of the bottom of your teeth?

23:18.956 --> 23:20.268
Like, mmm, fresh and so clean.

23:20.356 --> 23:22.097
Mm, what do you really want?

23:23.112 --> 23:25.101
Uh...

23:26.026 --> 23:27.030
Gibbs.

23:27.118 --> 23:29.042
- Still no idea where he went?
- No.

23:29.169 --> 23:30.605
- I was hoping you might know.
- Me?

23:30.693 --> 23:32.753
No. I have no such
superpower.

23:32.890 --> 23:34.690
But I wouldn't worry
if I were you.

23:34.778 --> 23:36.563
He can take care of himself.
He's a big boy.

23:36.651 --> 23:38.764
Hmm. He is a big boy
who just walked out

23:38.852 --> 23:39.918
of a crime scene
a few hours ago.

23:40.005 --> 23:41.920
- Is that what he did? Why?
- I don't know.

23:42.183 --> 23:45.235
Uh, but I think it might
have to do with some secret

23:45.323 --> 23:47.604
- that he shared with us last week, so...
- A secret.

23:47.692 --> 23:49.476
Are the initials
Pedro Hernandez,

23:49.564 --> 23:50.696
by any chance?

23:50.784 --> 23:52.790
- You know, too?
- It-it only seemed fair.

23:52.878 --> 23:55.112
- Gibbs knows quite a few of mine, so...
- Hey.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.674
- There you are.
- Hey.

23:57.042 --> 23:58.678
Jack knows Gibbs's secret.

23:59.174 --> 24:00.174
Really?

24:00.424 --> 24:01.961
Kind of makes you wonder

24:02.049 --> 24:03.596
- who else knows.
- Okay.

24:03.684 --> 24:06.032
Stop wondering.
I am fairly certain

24:06.120 --> 24:07.729
- we are Gibbs' chosen few.
- Look, I would love

24:07.816 --> 24:09.166
to talk about this right now,

24:09.254 --> 24:10.814
but we just got a
hit on the BOLO.

24:10.902 --> 24:13.275
MPD has Jordan McCarthy
in custody.

24:13.382 --> 24:14.660
Well, to be continued?

24:14.748 --> 24:16.392
I have a feeling, yep.

24:18.785 --> 24:20.570
Here's your man.
Jordan McCarthy.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.549
He's not exactly in custody.

24:22.637 --> 24:25.437
Two bullet wounds and no
I.D. Uniforms found him

24:25.525 --> 24:27.707
- and matched his prints to your BOLO.
<i>- Hey, Captain.</i>

24:27.794 --> 24:29.275
Excuse me.

24:30.949 --> 24:33.430
Two bullets to the chest.
Same as Wilson.

24:33.518 --> 24:36.304
So if this is over $3 million
in stolen Taliban money...

24:36.392 --> 24:38.757
And Calfa's
our only Marine left alive,

24:38.845 --> 24:40.492
he's either
the next one to die, or...

24:40.580 --> 24:41.927
Or he's our killer.

24:42.275 --> 24:44.032
Yeah.

24:47.769 --> 24:49.017
This is nuts.

24:49.121 --> 24:52.072
You said I was free to go.
And what is it now?

24:52.160 --> 24:53.666
Can't I just get on
with my life?

24:53.754 --> 24:55.127
Get on with your life?

24:55.215 --> 24:57.283
Is that what you were doing
when we caught you

24:57.371 --> 24:59.370
- packing your car for a quick getaway?
- What do you expect?

24:59.457 --> 25:01.627
You've got me spooked.
What if it isZakir?

25:01.715 --> 25:04.178
One of his devotees,
like you said?

25:10.200 --> 25:12.588
Jordan.

25:12.676 --> 25:13.741
So you got me back

25:13.829 --> 25:16.020
- for my own protection?
- Unless this is about

25:16.114 --> 25:17.293
that $3 million you skimmed

25:17.403 --> 25:19.270
off Zakir's cash pile.

25:21.272 --> 25:22.973
They never proved that.

25:23.171 --> 25:24.864
Well, that's
certainly not a denial.

25:24.959 --> 25:26.739
- Good as a confession for me.
- No.

25:26.827 --> 25:29.621
Not yet.
Check out his body language.

25:29.957 --> 25:31.989
Wait, hang on, now.
That...

25:32.077 --> 25:35.602
that came out wrong.
I-I'm a little confused.

25:35.733 --> 25:37.822
No, you're not.
You're relieved.

25:38.114 --> 25:39.638
Big secret's finally out.

25:39.725 --> 25:41.814
No more burden to carry around.

25:41.945 --> 25:43.985
See, I think you took
that money with a plan

25:44.073 --> 25:46.475
to sit on it
until you guys retired.

25:46.563 --> 25:47.828
But you got greedy.

25:47.916 --> 25:49.188
You got rid of McCarthy

25:49.276 --> 25:51.404
and used his phone
to get Wilson to come over.

25:51.492 --> 25:52.477
You got rid of him, too.

25:52.565 --> 25:53.382
- No.
- Yes, you did.

25:53.470 --> 25:55.373
Then you searched
Wilson's place

25:55.461 --> 25:56.655
to make it look like a robbery,

25:56.742 --> 25:58.091
and then you took off
with the $3 million.

25:58.178 --> 25:59.664
Whoa. Whoa, no.

25:59.752 --> 26:01.758
Slow down.
That part's all wrong.

26:01.846 --> 26:03.544
Which part?

26:06.078 --> 26:08.016
You know what?
Never mind.

26:08.319 --> 26:10.016
I'm-I'm done talking.

26:10.175 --> 26:11.437
I want to see my lawyer.

26:11.713 --> 26:15.039
Well,
n-now you can celebrate.

26:19.860 --> 26:22.158
Well, looks like
we've got some good news.

26:22.375 --> 26:23.508
Really?

26:23.649 --> 26:24.882
Tell her?

26:25.064 --> 26:26.213
I can go home?

26:26.301 --> 26:27.837
- Sorry it took so long.
- Does that mean

26:27.924 --> 26:29.133
you caught the guy?

26:29.296 --> 26:31.385
It wasn't Rick's friend,
was it?

26:32.165 --> 26:33.492
I'm afraid
we can't say more.

26:33.580 --> 26:36.024
- But I can give you a ride home.
- Yes.

26:36.129 --> 26:38.349
Please.
And thank you both.

26:38.586 --> 26:40.655
We'll, uh, we'll likely have
some follow-up questions

26:40.742 --> 26:41.719
over the next few days.

26:41.807 --> 26:43.069
But out of curiosity,

26:43.157 --> 26:44.727
did your husband ever mention

26:44.815 --> 26:46.686
having a nest egg of any kind?

26:46.774 --> 26:47.711
Nest egg?

26:47.799 --> 26:49.695
You know, something
he may have stashed away

26:49.783 --> 26:50.813
for retirement.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.207
I wish.

26:52.295 --> 26:53.781
You have no idea.

26:54.264 --> 26:57.938
But if he did,
he certainly didn't tell me.

27:06.899 --> 27:09.162
Mind you, I'm not one
to judge what you did,

27:09.249 --> 27:11.797
but avenging your
family's murder...

27:12.500 --> 27:15.000
That's one hell of
a justification. Doesn't make it right.

27:15.141 --> 27:17.387
Yeah, but... I've locked people up
for less than that.

27:17.475 --> 27:19.008
I got it.

27:19.259 --> 27:21.360
But let's table
this for a second.

27:21.487 --> 27:23.430
I want
a little bit more context.

27:23.518 --> 27:26.211
Tell me what's been going on
with you lately.

27:26.309 --> 27:27.398
Nothing much.

27:28.024 --> 27:29.443
Humor me.

27:32.765 --> 27:35.735
I almost got shot last week.

27:35.823 --> 27:36.867
- Couple times.
- Oh.

27:36.955 --> 27:38.130
That's nothing much.

27:38.312 --> 27:39.875
I was accused

27:39.978 --> 27:43.721
of killing an ex-fiancée
who I thought died on 9/11.

27:43.809 --> 27:45.763
Wow. Nothing, part two.

27:45.983 --> 27:47.462
Anything else?

27:49.133 --> 27:51.367
I had to burn one of my rules.

27:53.602 --> 27:55.024
Really?

27:56.008 --> 27:57.428
Which one?

27:58.619 --> 27:59.925
Ten.

28:02.039 --> 28:04.867
"Never get personally
involved in a case."

28:05.961 --> 28:07.250
Why?

28:07.421 --> 28:09.684
- Why'd you burn it?
- Thought it would help Bishop.

28:09.772 --> 28:12.203
- And did it?
- I don't know.

28:12.415 --> 28:15.797
- Did it help you?
- Does it look like it helped me, Doc?

28:16.258 --> 28:17.361
Oh, Gibbs.

28:17.702 --> 28:18.805
- This is good.
- No.

28:18.893 --> 28:20.068
It doesn't feel good.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.766
Which is great.

28:21.940 --> 28:25.000
This might just point us
to your core issue.

28:25.088 --> 28:26.195
My what?

28:26.283 --> 28:30.325
What if Rule Ten served
as a security blanket?

28:30.413 --> 28:32.561
- A firewall to your feelings.
- Oh, God, here we go.

28:32.649 --> 28:33.602
Yeah, here we go.

28:33.690 --> 28:36.977
Without Rule Ten,
what if you've been taking personally

28:37.065 --> 28:38.985
every case
since you started?

28:39.073 --> 28:40.594
- Subconsciously.
- Every case.

28:40.682 --> 28:43.195
In retrospect. What is that,
like, a thousand cases?

28:43.310 --> 28:45.500
Falling like dominoes
right onto you.

28:45.588 --> 28:48.203
I mean, talk about a weight
to carry around.

28:48.348 --> 28:51.633
And what if under that weight,
it's pointing you

28:51.721 --> 28:54.539
toward something
truly frightening?

28:54.627 --> 28:56.211
- Prison.
- No. Forget about

28:56.298 --> 28:58.806
turning yourself in.
I'm talking about the big "R."

28:58.894 --> 29:00.461
- No.
- Retirement.

29:01.187 --> 29:04.712
What if it's pointing you
towards thinking about...

29:04.799 --> 29:07.633
- No. Mm-mm.
- ..you know, maybe...

29:07.721 --> 29:08.852
hanging it up?

29:08.940 --> 29:10.693
- No.
- Oh. Well,

29:10.781 --> 29:11.875
answer a little faster.

29:11.963 --> 29:13.212
Don't take so long
to think about it.

29:13.299 --> 29:15.703
I don't need to thinkabout it.
I thought about it years ago.

29:15.791 --> 29:17.485
- The timing was not right.
- Gibbs.

29:17.573 --> 29:18.914
Years ago.

29:20.639 --> 29:23.297
Will there ever be a right time?

29:30.236 --> 29:32.227
I'm worried
about what I would do

29:32.315 --> 29:33.882
without what I do.

29:37.133 --> 29:38.267
The direction.

29:38.354 --> 29:39.797
Structure.

29:42.552 --> 29:44.554
NCIS centers me.

29:51.461 --> 29:53.008
Without it...

29:55.367 --> 29:56.797
Yeah, without it.

29:56.890 --> 29:58.370
Scary stuff.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.071
Mm-hmm.

30:02.633 --> 30:04.836
All right. You're all good.

30:04.952 --> 30:06.214
Coast is clear.

30:08.297 --> 30:09.813
A lot to clean up.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.399
You got friends to help?

30:12.487 --> 30:13.696
Lots.

30:13.929 --> 30:17.156
Many phone calls to
make, along with...

30:18.578 --> 30:20.274
funeral arrangements.

30:20.658 --> 30:23.078
Again, I'm-I'm sorry.

30:23.727 --> 30:25.180
If, um...

30:25.409 --> 30:26.976
if you ever need anything.

30:28.780 --> 30:30.695
You've done so much already.

30:31.196 --> 30:32.516
More than you know.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.899
Thank you.

30:38.008 --> 30:40.110
Okay. Good night.

30:40.366 --> 30:41.715
Good night.

31:10.057 --> 31:12.494
- Freeze! NCIS!
- Oh, God! Don't shoot!

31:12.582 --> 31:14.976
Hands. Hands!
Let me see your hands.

31:15.320 --> 31:18.018
- Who are you?
- Lori. Lori Wilson. I-I live here.

31:18.106 --> 31:20.848
- What?
- Wait, NCIS? What do you want?

31:22.621 --> 31:24.011
Stay here.

31:25.479 --> 31:27.386
Hang on, let me get my key.

31:31.933 --> 31:34.371
I said I have my key.
You didn't have to...

31:34.732 --> 31:36.647
What happened in here?

31:38.692 --> 31:40.401
Where's Rick?

31:43.203 --> 31:44.604
Rick?

31:46.306 --> 31:48.612
Show me your I.D.
Where you been?

31:48.722 --> 31:50.175
At my mother's in Florida.

31:50.263 --> 31:52.323
I came back a day early
to surprise Richard.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.925
Now where the hell is he?

31:54.399 --> 31:56.565
Answer me.
Is Richard okay?

31:57.232 --> 31:58.628
Where does Richard keep
his money?

31:58.716 --> 32:00.362
What money?
We don't have any...

32:01.199 --> 32:04.034
Oh, no.
Not the brooch.

32:04.309 --> 32:06.667
- What? What brooch?
- Have we been robbed?

32:06.925 --> 32:07.946
Please don't tell me...

32:08.034 --> 32:09.073
What brooch?

32:09.161 --> 32:11.554
The brooch.
The Victoria brooch.

32:18.379 --> 32:19.685
It's gone.

32:19.873 --> 32:21.525
- They took it.
- Who are they?

32:21.613 --> 32:23.441
I don't know,
but it's worth a fortune.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.611
Where's Richard?

32:34.533 --> 32:37.320
Compared to all the cash
Zakir had in his bunker,

32:37.408 --> 32:38.929
what we took seemed
like nothing.

32:39.017 --> 32:40.713
Couldn't believe it came
to $3 million.

32:41.008 --> 32:42.814
Too much to smuggle
back home.

32:42.905 --> 32:45.978
So, uh, Rick turned it
into merchandise.

32:46.205 --> 32:47.676
Bought that Victoria brooch

32:47.764 --> 32:50.611
from some fancy auction house
in Dubai.

32:51.228 --> 32:52.697
And how did this
imposter get away?

32:52.785 --> 32:54.900
Slipped out the back door,
hopped a fence,

32:54.988 --> 32:56.816
but the neighbor said
that she drove off in a car.

32:56.903 --> 32:57.845
BOLO's out?

32:57.933 --> 32:59.283
On the car with her description.

32:59.371 --> 33:01.181
Just a description?
No photo?

33:01.269 --> 33:02.604
Yeah, somehow
she was able to avoid

33:02.691 --> 33:03.823
all the surveillance cameras.

33:03.910 --> 33:05.477
All we have is
a few side angles.

33:05.564 --> 33:06.860
<i>We were gonna
sell back the brooch,</i>

33:06.947 --> 33:08.611
<i>and go our separate ways.</i>

33:08.698 --> 33:10.507
Besides you three
and Rick's wife,

33:10.595 --> 33:12.244
who else knew about the brooch?

33:12.332 --> 33:15.744
Well, I never told a soul,
but McCarthy could've told anybody.

33:16.041 --> 33:17.445
Like maybe a special someone?

33:17.532 --> 33:19.882
Mm, he had lots of someones,
none I'd call special,

33:19.970 --> 33:23.773
but, uh, his last
was this crazy Russian.

33:23.861 --> 33:26.275
Olga or Helga.

33:26.428 --> 33:28.343
Could this be her?

33:29.855 --> 33:32.244
Ah, hard to say.

33:32.673 --> 33:34.375
But no matter.
When we talked last month,

33:34.462 --> 33:35.986
he was getting ready
to dump her.

33:36.813 --> 33:38.463
The Victoria brooch.

33:39.032 --> 33:41.600
I found it on
an auction house website.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.821
The king of Spain gave this
to Queen Victoria herself,

33:44.908 --> 33:48.509
current value:
$2.8 million.

33:53.939 --> 33:55.705
Son of a bitch.

33:58.577 --> 34:01.056
She was wearing it.
The whole day.

34:01.892 --> 34:03.736
She was playing us
and I missed it.

34:03.824 --> 34:06.156
- No, we all missed it.
- Yeah, and you know why?

34:06.244 --> 34:09.353
- Gibbs... and his big secret.
- That's not why.

34:09.463 --> 34:11.353
- We were distracted, McGee.
- Don't blame it on Gibbs.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.978
Why not?
He's not here, is he?

34:13.065 --> 34:15.329
Hey, Nick, this
thing with Gibbs

34:15.416 --> 34:17.351
might have knocked us
all off our game a bit,

34:17.438 --> 34:19.752
but don't tell the entire
squad room, okay?

34:19.840 --> 34:21.891
Look, I didn't care what he did
in the first place.

34:21.987 --> 34:24.822
It's not a big deal.
Uh, it is a big deal to some of us.

34:24.909 --> 34:26.627
It was to me
when I first heard.

34:26.715 --> 34:28.908
See, I still want to know what
he expects us to do about it.

34:28.995 --> 34:29.996
Really, Tim?

34:30.083 --> 34:31.822
With that again? Like what?

34:31.909 --> 34:33.635
That's a bigger question
we can't answer right now.

34:33.722 --> 34:35.353
Yeah, because we have
bigger things to do,

34:35.440 --> 34:37.181
like catching
this sneaky lady here.

34:37.270 --> 34:40.266
Was she really wearing
$3 million on her jacket?

34:40.353 --> 34:41.525
That makes me sweat
just saying it.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.190
She must have found
it right before we got

34:43.277 --> 34:44.661
- to the house, Nick.
- Yeah.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.181
She pinned it on
and played us for suckers.

34:47.268 --> 34:50.342
Suckers who now have
a proper I.D.

34:51.739 --> 34:53.685
- Kasie, don't mess with me.
- Who's messing?

34:53.773 --> 34:55.803
Did you not pour this
lady a glass of water

34:55.891 --> 34:57.600
in the conference
room this morning?

34:58.100 --> 35:00.014
Wait, are you... mm.

35:00.102 --> 35:01.917
- Are you telling me...?
- I'm telling you

35:02.005 --> 35:03.920
that she clearly tried
to wipe it clean,

35:04.008 --> 35:06.975
but missed a spot and left me
with a partial print.

35:08.595 --> 35:10.021
I don't believe it. That's her.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.068
I'm updating the BOLO.

35:11.156 --> 35:14.545
Inga Petrov, 36, and a
former FSB specialist,

35:14.633 --> 35:17.045
emigrated from the
Ukraine in 2007,

35:17.133 --> 35:19.475
and according to Interpol,
has been using her skills

35:19.563 --> 35:22.000
to pull off various scams
and cons ever since.

35:22.135 --> 35:23.920
Huh. At least
you got taken by a pro.

35:24.007 --> 35:26.352
- Who's also now a killer.
- You're a genius.

35:26.440 --> 35:29.086
- A simple thank you will due.
- How about a hit on the BOLO?

35:29.258 --> 35:30.648
- Already?
- It happens.

35:30.736 --> 35:33.406
Inga Petrov booked a flight
to Costa Rica yesterday.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.649
- It leaves tonight from Reagan.
- I'll call airport security.

35:35.736 --> 35:37.547
Call from the car.
Let's go.

35:38.283 --> 35:40.503
So let's make
a little deal.

35:40.621 --> 35:42.656
You may not be retiring,

35:43.141 --> 35:44.743
but you're not turning
yourself in, either.

35:44.830 --> 35:46.273
Eh, we'll see.

35:46.563 --> 35:48.063
Gibbs, I will gladly

35:48.151 --> 35:49.969
- pick this up again in the morning.
- Okay.

35:50.057 --> 35:52.070
- Okay... for now.
- Okay?

35:52.206 --> 35:53.773
<i>We're gonna start on this again?</i>

35:53.993 --> 35:55.672
<i>You're the one
that started this.</i>

35:55.815 --> 35:57.077
You always say that.

35:57.165 --> 35:58.781
And that's our cue.

36:04.476 --> 36:05.758
What?

36:06.382 --> 36:07.468
My team.

36:07.556 --> 36:09.031
Oh, again with the team.

36:09.155 --> 36:10.802
You've trained
them well enough.

36:10.890 --> 36:12.961
If they have a problem
with what you did, Gibbs,

36:13.049 --> 36:14.833
they're gonna let
you know about it.

36:14.921 --> 36:16.383
<i>You don't tell me when to quit.</i>

36:16.471 --> 36:18.703
<i>- I'll tell you when I quit.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

36:18.915 --> 36:21.359
- Stop already.
- Don't tell me to stop.

36:22.531 --> 36:24.371
- Don't do this, baby, please.
- Don't do what?

36:24.502 --> 36:26.242
This. Don't do this.
I'm sorry.

36:26.330 --> 36:29.484
You don't tell me nothing,
got it?

36:33.456 --> 36:35.248
Why did you
have to do that?

36:35.336 --> 36:37.023
What is wrong with you?

36:37.111 --> 36:38.950
You see, this is why
you can't go anywhere.

36:39.038 --> 36:41.758
The world needs more Gibbs
right where he is.

36:42.085 --> 36:43.782
<i>Is it broke?</i>

36:44.031 --> 36:46.785
<i>This is the final
boarding call for Flight 6805</i>

36:46.872 --> 36:49.957
<i>to San José, Costa Rica,
now boarding at Gate 3.</i>

36:50.045 --> 36:52.049
<i>Please have
your boarding pass ready.</i>

36:52.137 --> 36:53.403
Hey, Inga.

36:54.441 --> 36:55.834
Where's the brooch?

36:56.055 --> 36:58.293
Safely packed away, I hope.

36:59.653 --> 37:01.974
I spent a year
with that loser,

37:02.176 --> 37:04.645
- just waiting for him to cash in.
- Mm.

37:04.733 --> 37:06.254
And then he dumped you.

37:06.887 --> 37:08.504
I tried to reason with him.

37:08.723 --> 37:10.986
With Rick, too,
but they wouldn't listen.

37:11.074 --> 37:14.687
I kept their secret,
and for that, I deserved a piece.

37:15.098 --> 37:18.077
I couldn't just let them
cut me out, could I?

37:20.100 --> 37:23.277
No more than you
can talk me out of this.

37:26.074 --> 37:31.379
Or... maybe you could
come with me?

37:34.004 --> 37:35.660
Maybe.

37:38.315 --> 37:40.606
But then what would
my friends say?

37:52.534 --> 37:54.624
So where's your head now,
Popeye?

37:56.652 --> 37:59.425
They never say thank you.

37:59.513 --> 38:00.906
Who's "they"?

38:00.994 --> 38:02.735
- That woman?
- Oh, please.

38:03.078 --> 38:04.411
You get plenty of thanks.

38:04.499 --> 38:05.966
And besides, it doesn't matter
what she did,

38:06.053 --> 38:07.207
it matters what you did.

38:07.295 --> 38:09.133
Everyone else
just stood there watching,

38:09.221 --> 38:10.909
while you did something.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.557
And everyone's
grateful for that,

38:12.645 --> 38:14.560
whether they say
anything or not.

38:14.818 --> 38:17.682
And while we're on
the subject of doing things...

38:18.214 --> 38:20.018
What's your endgame,
anyway?

38:21.198 --> 38:22.674
My endgame?

38:22.869 --> 38:24.604
Well, if not prison
or retirement,

38:24.692 --> 38:26.955
then how do you want
all this to end for you?

38:27.233 --> 38:31.354
When will you ever be able
to say "mission accomplished"?

38:31.669 --> 38:33.330
I owe too much to my team.

38:33.455 --> 38:35.631
Yeah, but until when?

38:36.164 --> 38:37.744
Until you die?

38:37.945 --> 38:41.688
I mean, would that be the
ideal way for you to end this?

38:42.095 --> 38:44.026
You know, a hero's exit.

38:44.245 --> 38:46.611
Jumping on a grenade
to save everybody.

38:46.699 --> 38:49.252
There are a lot
worse ways to go than that.

38:49.340 --> 38:51.104
You know,
it reminds me...

38:51.416 --> 38:53.229
Who was that old actress?

38:53.317 --> 38:54.955
Uh, I can't remember her name.

38:55.043 --> 38:57.580
When she was near the end
of her life, someone asked her

38:57.668 --> 38:59.931
if she wanted to be buried
or cremated, and she said:

39:00.019 --> 39:02.935
"Just throw me into
those bright lights, baby."

39:05.454 --> 39:07.042
Sound about right?

39:07.769 --> 39:09.589
Yeah, I like that.

39:09.916 --> 39:11.918
Mm.

39:15.339 --> 39:16.891
- Oh, good.
- Hey.

39:16.978 --> 39:18.456
Burning the midnight oil.

39:18.573 --> 39:20.079
I got your text.
You said to wait.

39:20.167 --> 39:21.370
And it's only 10:30.

39:21.458 --> 39:24.940
I hated running out on you
like that. Middle of a session.

39:25.067 --> 39:27.212
Uh, no worries.
Emergencies happen.

39:27.300 --> 39:29.440
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

39:29.573 --> 39:30.667
How is he?

39:30.755 --> 39:31.894
He?

39:33.284 --> 39:34.474
Right.

39:35.003 --> 39:37.183
He's okay,
but I'm here to finish with you.

39:37.534 --> 39:39.493
Felt like you were on
the verge of getting past

39:39.581 --> 39:40.915
your feelings
about your daughter.

39:41.103 --> 39:43.409
Right. Okay.

39:43.917 --> 39:46.753
Okay. You want to talk here,
or, please, let's grab a drink?

39:46.841 --> 39:50.151
No, please. No drinks.
Talk here.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.449
Okay.

39:56.061 --> 39:59.806
So... where did we leave off?

39:59.894 --> 40:02.372
Well, right before
my phone rang,

40:02.459 --> 40:06.003
you used the words,
"I feel alone."

40:08.088 --> 40:09.946
I don't think
that's quite what I meant.

40:10.034 --> 40:11.229
Then what did you mean?

40:11.347 --> 40:12.947
Um...

40:13.886 --> 40:16.125
There's no one I can talk to.

40:17.175 --> 40:18.948
I... can't talk

40:19.036 --> 40:22.331
to my daughter... at all.

40:23.112 --> 40:25.550
Can't open up to my friends.

40:25.956 --> 40:28.214
And the one person that I...

40:28.962 --> 40:31.901
want to open up to the most...

40:33.308 --> 40:36.854
I'm not sure they feel
the same way I do, so...

40:38.278 --> 40:40.979
"Feel the same way" as in...

40:42.934 --> 40:45.190
You sure you don't want
to grab that drink?

40:56.577 --> 40:58.300
Uh... Gibbs?

40:58.388 --> 41:00.564
- What the hell?
- Oh, not the hair again.

41:00.652 --> 41:02.487
Where have
you been all day?

41:02.917 --> 41:04.112
I took some lost time.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.800
- At the barber shop?
- Nick.

41:05.888 --> 41:08.128
- What did I miss?
- Oh, not much.

41:08.389 --> 41:10.217
Uh, yeah, no,
just another day.

41:10.839 --> 41:11.886
We get the bad guy?

41:11.974 --> 41:13.541
Actually, we...

41:16.300 --> 41:19.800
Never mind. It's, uh,
too late, too long a story.

41:19.914 --> 41:22.245
Yeah, and since we started
out this day exhausted,

41:22.333 --> 41:24.636
um, you're gonna have to wait
till tomorrow for an update.

41:25.214 --> 41:26.550
All right.

41:26.753 --> 41:28.237
Fair enough.

41:29.509 --> 41:30.964
I'll see you then.

41:35.444 --> 41:38.667
Anything else you want
to talk about, boss?

41:43.255 --> 41:45.083
Uh, you tell me.

41:47.282 --> 41:52.214
Anything we should...
talk about?

41:55.417 --> 41:57.008
Anything at all?

41:57.644 --> 41:59.140
No, sir.

42:01.167 --> 42:02.620
Nothing.

42:02.831 --> 42:06.894
Unless there's something
that you want to talk about.

42:09.020 --> 42:11.300
No. No.

42:11.388 --> 42:12.839
I'm good.

42:13.440 --> 42:14.675
Night.

42:16.017 --> 42:17.370
Gibbs!

42:19.104 --> 42:20.636
Where the hell have you been?

42:21.120 --> 42:22.956
Leon, what?
What's the matter?

42:23.166 --> 42:24.354
It's Fornell.

42:24.495 --> 42:27.386
You need to get
to Mercy Point Hospital. Fast.
