JILL:
<i>She parades Brynn in here.</i>

00:07.808 --> 00:09.810
<i>It's a slap in the face</i>

00:09.810 --> 00:11.111
ASHLEE:
<i>I'm not gonna sit here</i>

ABBY LEE: <i>The minis are gonna</i>

00:15.849 --> 00:18.452
MELISSA: <i>I worry bringing</i>
<i>these mini kids is way too much</i>

00:18.452 --> 00:19.753

REPORTER: Abby Lee Miller,
in serious legal drama,

00:21.855 --> 00:23.590
is charged with fraud.

00:23.590 --> 00:24.892
I'm finished.

First, we have,

Don't trust anybody.

00:38.505 --> 00:39.940
KENDALL: Maddie!
NIA: Maddie!

00:41.108 --> 00:43.076
Brynn, you're doing a jazz solo.

00:43.076 --> 00:46.179
And Maddie, you are also doing
a solo this weekend.

00:46.179 --> 00:47.381
ASHLEE: <i>Brynn's gonna win,</i>

00:47.381 --> 00:48.882

00:48.882 --> 00:50.417
Abby's not here today.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.553
I have a huge
legal issue going on.

♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

ABBY LEE (voice breaking):
<i>Hi. It's Abby Lee Miller.</i>

01:15.442 --> 01:18.712
Not good. Not good.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.781
I'm in a bit of a crisis,

01:20.781 --> 01:22.983
and I probably shouldn't
have called you,

01:22.983 --> 01:25.552
but there's no one else to call.

01:25.552 --> 01:28.722
And I'm sitting in the back
office of my studio, which is

01:28.722 --> 01:31.825
my private personal space, okay?

01:33.393 --> 01:34.728
I've had it.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.264
Five years of my life.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.967
I have made these kids stars.

01:39.967 --> 01:43.036
If you can help me, help me.

01:43.036 --> 01:46.573
Yes. You can help me.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.677
JILL: Abby not know
what time class starts?

01:50.677 --> 01:52.446
Somehow we managed to get

01:52.446 --> 01:53.947
our kids up at 7:00 a. m.,

01:53.947 --> 01:56.049
dressed, ready to go, and yet,

01:56.049 --> 01:57.985
where's...?
That's crazy.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.987
JESSALYNN:
<i>Abby had a huge meltdown</i>

01:59.987 --> 02:03.757
<i>last week, because of what's</i>
<i>happening in her personal life.</i>

02:03.757 --> 02:06.893
She's under a federal
investigation for hiding money.

02:06.893 --> 02:10.130
<i>She has so much going on that</i>
<i>we can't even relate to it.</i>

02:10.130 --> 02:13.266
<i>I honestly wonder if she'll</i>
<i>even be at pyramid today.</i>

02:13.266 --> 02:15.168
Do we think
Abby's coming back?

02:15.168 --> 02:16.103
JOJO:
Guys, it's Maddie!

02:16.103 --> 02:17.270
Yay!
Yay!

02:18.805 --> 02:20.040
Maddie!
Maddie!

02:20.040 --> 02:21.208
Maddie!

02:21.208 --> 02:23.377
(whoops)
(girls laughing)

02:23.377 --> 02:25.979
JILL:
<i>Thank God Maddie is back.</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:28.548
We have our complete
ALDC team now.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.651
<i>Well, except for Abby.</i>

02:30.651 --> 02:33.320
<i>Ashlee has been</i>
<i>on her high horse with Brynn.</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:36.056
BRYNN: Abby, I was just curious
as to why Kendall has a solo,

02:36.056 --> 02:37.157
and not Brynn.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.692
I know she really
wants another one.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.728
JILL:
<i>Maybe with Maddie back,</i>
<i>Ashlee will finally</i>

02:41.728 --> 02:42.963
shut her mouth.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.899
So, Maddie, how is it,
you know, filming the movie?

02:45.899 --> 02:46.933
Is it different? And...

02:49.036 --> 02:51.304
I know it sounds weird,
but you feel like a movie star.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.674
Because, like, you're...

02:53.674 --> 02:55.442
MADDIE:
<i>I did have a lot of fun filming</i>

02:55.442 --> 02:58.111
the movie, but I do
miss my friends, and I was

02:58.111 --> 03:00.213
<i>so excited to be back</i>
<i>dancing with them.</i>

03:00.213 --> 03:01.415
MELISSA:
So, guys,

03:01.415 --> 03:03.383
why don't you go...?

03:03.383 --> 03:04.584
Like, what should they do?

03:04.584 --> 03:05.819
ABBY LEE:
Get out of here!

03:07.254 --> 03:08.655
HOLLY:
Are those happy yells?

03:08.655 --> 03:11.958
<i>We all heard</i>
<i>Abby screaming, so...</i>

03:11.958 --> 03:13.360
we know Abby's here.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.761
Abby has a bed

03:14.761 --> 03:15.962
<i>in the back of her studio.</i>

03:15.962 --> 03:17.130
<i>She lives there.</i>

03:17.130 --> 03:20.467
<i>I think Abby has lost her mind.</i>

03:20.467 --> 03:23.303
So does anybody want to go in
and get Abby? I don't.

03:23.303 --> 03:24.571
Not in the mood.
Why don't we send
the kids in?

03:24.571 --> 03:25.539
No way!
No!

03:25.539 --> 03:27.007
JILL:
Oh, here's her minis.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.241
Maybe... (gasps)

03:28.241 --> 03:30.110
Maybe we can send
the mini moms in!

03:30.110 --> 03:32.079
Shh. Shh.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.113
Hi, girls.

03:33.113 --> 03:34.648
GIRLS: Hi!
JILL:
Okay, let 'em get

03:34.648 --> 03:36.316
situated, and then we'll say,
"Oh, go on in and grab..."
Mm‐hmm.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.687
Is Abby here?
JESSALYNN:
She's in her office,

03:40.687 --> 03:42.856
if you want to let her know that
you guys are here or anything.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.558
JILL:
Just go on in.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.359
ASHLEE:
You're horrible, Jess.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.098
Hello, Miss Abby.

03:52.365 --> 03:53.366
Good morning.

03:53.366 --> 03:54.501
(voice breaking):
I am hysterical.

03:54.501 --> 03:58.105
I have done everything.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.206
There's nothing more I can do.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.907
What's going on?
I don't know.

04:00.907 --> 04:04.878
And right now, I don't have
a bra on, my hair is in rollers,

04:04.878 --> 04:08.849
I'm in my slippers, and I have
a huge legal issue going on.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.785
I can give you lists of the
bull crap that I'm dealing with.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.887
I'm finished.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.589
Shoot.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.991
So what is she upset about?

04:17.991 --> 04:19.126
KERRI: I don't know
what she's upset about,

04:19.126 --> 04:20.761
but the fact
that she doesn't have a bra on,

04:20.761 --> 04:22.362
and she can't finish her hair‐‐
that's what's getting me.

04:22.362 --> 04:23.964
Like, give her some space
so she can at least

04:23.964 --> 04:25.899
get herself together
just for a second.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.668
She's had all day
to get herself together.

04:28.668 --> 04:31.538
JILL:
<i>I know Abby has some personal</i>
<i>financial issues</i>

04:31.538 --> 04:35.442
<i>outside of the studio,</i>
<i>but enough is enough.</i>

04:35.442 --> 04:37.210
Abby just needs to stop.

04:37.210 --> 04:40.313
Quit tarnishing your name
and your brand,

04:40.313 --> 04:42.048
especially in front
of your new team.

04:42.048 --> 04:44.718
<i>We need to go back and</i>

04:44.718 --> 04:46.153
drag her out here.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.420
ABBY LEE:
Who's in this room?

04:47.420 --> 04:49.189
We are.
Melissa and Jill. Hi.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.691
Okay, you guys don't understand
how serious this is.

04:51.691 --> 04:53.393
Get out of here!
JILL:
No. I know.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.095
No, you don't!
I understand.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.997
Or you wouldn't have
come in here with a camera!

04:56.997 --> 04:58.932
You would have come in
by yourself and asked me!

04:58.932 --> 05:01.201
MELISSA:
<i>I'm really sad because</i>
<i>Abby won't come out,</i>

05:01.201 --> 05:02.402
and, you know, Maddie just

05:02.402 --> 05:03.470
<i>booked a really great</i>
<i>photo shoot</i>

05:03.470 --> 05:04.871
<i>for this week,</i>

05:04.871 --> 05:08.208
<i>and I want the announcement</i>
<i>to be in front of Abby.</i>

05:08.208 --> 05:10.710
It's so exciting, and Abby needs
to be a part of it.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.445
GIANNA:
<i>And balance.</i>

05:12.445 --> 05:13.814
Two, three,

05:13.814 --> 05:15.615
<i>four‐‐ you can do it.</i>

05:15.615 --> 05:17.150
We've been here two hours,

05:17.150 --> 05:18.985
and still, no Abby.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.388
<i>Bless Gia, who's working</i>
<i>with the girls, but that's</i>

05:21.388 --> 05:24.057
two hours wasted,
no pyramid, no assignments.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.792
I don't care about the pyramid,
honestly.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.594
Well, you don't because
you've been here forever.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.029
Her not being here

05:29.029 --> 05:30.397
affects you guys way less

05:30.397 --> 05:32.499
than people that are new,
like me and the mini team.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.934
I gave up a lot

05:33.934 --> 05:37.704
to be here, yeah.
JESSALYNN:
No, I get it, yeah.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.506
ASHLEE:
I mean, the only

05:39.506 --> 05:40.874
person that's won the overall

05:40.874 --> 05:42.042
since we got here was Brynn.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.877
Oh, my God, she never shuts up.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.145
So, that's one reason

05:45.145 --> 05:46.446
why they are not...
Blah, blah, blah, blah,

05:46.446 --> 05:47.614
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah,

05:47.614 --> 05:48.849
blah, blah.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.116
ASHLEE:
I just think
what's happening

05:50.116 --> 05:52.586
is, the people that thought
they were going to

05:52.586 --> 05:54.788
slide into Maddie's
spot are the most

05:54.788 --> 05:57.157
unwelcoming of us being here.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.925
JILL:
<i>Maddie helped create this team.</i>

05:58.925 --> 06:00.293
<i>I mean, no one</i>

06:00.293 --> 06:01.728
can take her place.

06:01.728 --> 06:04.264
Well, I know that you have
a sore spot about Maddie

06:04.264 --> 06:06.666
being replaced, because
this was supposed to be

06:06.666 --> 06:09.369
Kendall's year, and it's not
shaping up to be that way.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.837
Be careful, Ashlee.

06:10.837 --> 06:12.873
Watch what you say.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.174
ASHLEE: At competition,
Kendall told Brynn

06:14.174 --> 06:15.709
she couldn't be
in any of the pictures

06:15.709 --> 06:16.977
'cause she wasn't on their team.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.545
Nia actually said, "Kendall,
you shouldn't say that."

06:18.545 --> 06:20.547
And she goes,
"I was just kidding."

06:20.547 --> 06:22.582
How do you think my
kid felt coming home?
Okay, she was just kidding.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.150
So she said it was just kidding.
That is so passive‐aggressive.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.752
<i>And you condone it.</i>

06:25.752 --> 06:28.321
You're daughter's a
smart‐ass, just like you.

06:28.321 --> 06:31.124
I told you I've had
enough of her mouth

06:31.124 --> 06:34.194
talking poorly
about a child.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.762
You feel good about
yourself, Ashlee?

06:35.762 --> 06:39.699
I don't know how saying fact is
talking poorly about a child.

06:39.699 --> 06:43.203
She needs to shut her
(bleep) (bleep) mouth!

06:43.203 --> 06:45.171
Who does she
think she is?!

06:45.171 --> 06:46.640
I'm gonna punch her
in the (bleep) face.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.642
Bitch.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.645
MAN: Hi.
MAN 2: Hi.

06:54.514 --> 06:55.815
Sergio, nice to meet you.
He loves her, yeah.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.083
I'm Jill.
James.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.585
James. Nice to meet you.
I never met you.
How are you?

06:58.585 --> 06:59.953
So, what do you guys...?
SERGIO:
No, you didn't meet him.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.187
I met... I love him.

07:01.187 --> 07:02.923
So we walk outside,
and I look over,

07:02.923 --> 07:05.158
and I'm like, "Sergio,
what are you doing here?

07:05.158 --> 07:07.460
<i>You are two hours early."</i>

07:07.460 --> 07:08.995
And here we come out,
and Jill's screaming,

07:08.995 --> 07:10.530
<i>and I can't let him</i>

07:10.530 --> 07:11.564
see us so upset

07:11.564 --> 07:12.565
<i>about another mom.</i>

07:12.565 --> 07:13.633
JILL:
Well, how do you know him?

07:13.633 --> 07:15.235
SERGIO:
I work for <i>Seventeen.</i> I book

07:15.235 --> 07:18.038
celebrities. When Maddie
was with me in New York,

07:18.038 --> 07:19.706
we had this idea about...
JILL:
Okay.

07:19.706 --> 07:22.175
...doing a story around her
for <i>Seventeen,</i> a fashion story.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.877
So we decided we should come out

07:23.877 --> 07:26.246
and see what other dancers
we should shoot with her.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.081
Oh, my gosh,
that's really special.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.382
JILL:
<i>Abby said</i>

07:29.382 --> 07:32.719
no other opportunities
this year outside of dance,

07:32.719 --> 07:35.388
but this is a Maddie project.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.190
<i>I'm sure Abby's gonna</i>
<i>let this one slide.</i>

07:37.190 --> 07:39.192
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>it's</i> Seventeen <i>magazine.</i>

07:39.192 --> 07:40.460
<i>Abby would be</i>

07:40.460 --> 07:41.828
crazy to say no.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.997
<i>I need to get my act together.</i>

07:43.997 --> 07:46.099
<i>I'll be damned</i>
<i>if Brynn were to get</i>

07:46.099 --> 07:47.834

29:51.957 --> 29:53.458

29:54.793 --> 29:56.094

six different...

29:56.094 --> 29:57.763

Let's ask Gia what she thought
who had the harder solo.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.107
Maddie could have done
Brynn's solo.

have done Maddie's solo.

30:12.577 --> 30:15.981

a scorpion on relevé?

30:15.981 --> 30:17.416
No, 'cause we don't do that.

of the tricks in there.

JESSALYNN: First of all,
no judge is impressed

30:20.952 --> 30:23.455

30:23.455 --> 30:26.091
And I will tell you,
your daughter,

30:26.091 --> 30:29.094
her transition out of her
full back split was terrible,

30:29.094 --> 30:30.862
so they'll probably
mark off for that.

30:30.862 --> 30:32.864

that JoJo

JILL: No.

39:47.952 --> 39:49.754
You nailed it on stage.

Remember how I kept saying,
"You were late,

<i>would come to the competition</i>

<i>Our girls look so beautiful.</i>

this will be the first

40:27.425 --> 40:29.327
<i>of many more to come.</i>

40:29.327 --> 40:31.329
GIANNA:
For next week,

40:31.329 --> 40:33.765
we are doing a line...

40:33.765 --> 40:34.999
with everyone.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.768
So minis are back next week.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.103
So since we're already planned
doing a line and a number,

40:39.103 --> 40:41.406
does that mean Abby will be here
or we're still gonna

40:41.406 --> 40:42.941
do it no matter what?
I just know that
that was her plan.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.642
So I just wanted to give you
guys as much info as I had.

40:44.642 --> 40:46.444
So you guys weren't
completely in the dark,

40:46.444 --> 40:47.712
because she wasn't here.

40:47.712 --> 40:49.347
JESSALYNN:
<i>Oh, great.</i>

40:49.347 --> 40:50.281
We're doing a dance
with the minis.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.649
<i>Hopefully this means</i>

40:51.649 --> 40:54.218
<i>Abby will show up</i>
<i>to work next week.</i>

40:55.687 --> 40:57.121
MELISSA: I just want
to ask you a question

40:57.121 --> 40:58.423
in front of Brynn's mom.

40:58.423 --> 41:00.224
She said that
her daughter's solo

41:00.224 --> 41:02.593
was more difficult
than Maddie's.

41:02.593 --> 41:05.263
I think it was.

41:05.263 --> 41:07.098
ASHLEE: <i>These moms better</i>
<i>get off their high horse</i>

41:07.098 --> 41:09.434
<i>and start making</i>
<i>their kids work harder.</i>

41:09.434 --> 41:10.635
Because Brynn
isn't going anywhere.

41:10.635 --> 41:11.936
She's gonna keep working

41:11.936 --> 41:13.137
till she's the best dancer
on the team.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.640
Well, I think the one difference

41:15.640 --> 41:17.675
between me and you guys
is that we actually want it.

41:17.675 --> 41:19.477
Brynn actually cares
if she wins.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.912
And she works hard to win.

41:20.912 --> 41:23.348
But you didn't win.
JESSALYNN:
You didn't win.

41:23.348 --> 41:24.549
Good job!
You didn't win.

41:24.549 --> 41:26.517
You got fourth!
(whoops)

41:26.517 --> 41:29.153
JoJo didn't even win
her age group last week.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.788
JILL:
One thing if you talk about

41:30.788 --> 41:32.790
your own child,
I can't, I can't
do this anymore.

41:32.790 --> 41:34.225
but don't talk
about someone else's.
I'm sick of it.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.426
Here we go.

41:35.426 --> 41:37.495
Brynn didn't beat Maddie today.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.198
Not even the next in line.

41:40.198 --> 41:42.467
I'm so (bleep)
out of this place.

41:42.467 --> 41:44.502
Brynn didn't beat Maddie!

41:44.502 --> 41:45.636
She lost!

41:45.636 --> 41:46.871
Brynn lost to Maddie.

41:46.871 --> 41:48.006
Brynn lost.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.008
Oh, my God,
I hate the woman.

41:56.114 --> 41:59.584
I am going to teach you
a large group number.

41:59.584 --> 42:02.253
Hah! It's messy.
We know it's messy.

42:02.253 --> 42:04.689
HOLLY:
<i>After Abby resigned last week,</i>

42:04.689 --> 42:07.291
I think it's very clear
Abby set us up for failure.

42:07.291 --> 42:08.993
I'm freaking out
about this dance.

42:08.993 --> 42:10.361
They're incredibly vulnerable.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.796
Don't let them make you cry.

42:11.796 --> 42:12.964
Everyone's hitting a wall.

42:12.964 --> 42:13.965
I threatened to call the cops

42:13.965 --> 42:15.133
on Tiffanie last night.

42:15.133 --> 42:16.801
And they have no leader.

42:16.801 --> 42:18.503
We really need to work
on being a team as well.

42:18.503 --> 42:19.404
What do we have to lose?

42:21.172 --> 42:21.939
(laughing)

42:21.939 --> 42:24.542
My sanity.
