02:12.133 --> 02:13.760
<i>They were hungry,
of course,</i>

02:13.927 --> 02:17.138
<i>having made their way through
their stores of dried meat</i>

02:17.305 --> 02:18.681
<i>and salt fish days ago,</i>

02:18.848 --> 02:22.769
<i>even though carefully,
professionally rationed.</i>

02:29.984 --> 02:32.487
<i>To a man,
they were expert seamen,</i>

02:32.654 --> 02:35.406
<i>yet no expertise
can surmount a sea</i>

02:35.573 --> 02:37.742
<i>that does not wish you
to reach shore.</i>

02:38.785 --> 02:41.955
- Come on!
- Heave, ho, heave.

02:42.121 --> 02:44.958
<i>- Until...</i>
- Heave, ho, hum.

02:45.124 --> 02:47.252
<i>..finally...</i>

02:47.418 --> 02:49.420
Heave, ho, hum.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.548
Heave, ho, heave.

02:51.714 --> 02:54.467
Heave, ho, hum.

02:54.634 --> 02:56.719
<i>..celebration was cut short.</i>

02:56.886 --> 02:59.931
<i>The land reached
was barren, rocky.</i>

03:00.098 --> 03:02.225
<i>No food, no shelter.</i>

03:02.392 --> 03:04.269
<i>Only biting insects and snakes.</i>

03:06.646 --> 03:08.022
<i>When they set off,</i>

03:08.189 --> 03:10.692
<i>they dreamt of the riches
they would accumulate,</i>

03:10.859 --> 03:13.570
<i>the fat-breasted women
they would send for.</i>

03:13.736 --> 03:15.697
<i>Their dreams changed to bread,</i>

03:15.864 --> 03:18.241
<i>roasted meats.</i>

03:18.408 --> 03:20.535
<i>Even a salad would do.</i>

03:31.212 --> 03:32.380
Hah!

03:41.723 --> 03:43.099
Reginn!

03:43.266 --> 03:45.226
<i>Gods.</i>

03:46.269 --> 03:49.272
<i>They did not yet have
a word in their language</i>

03:49.439 --> 03:51.357
<i>for 'miserable'.</i>

03:51.524 --> 03:53.651
<i>They would have to invent one.</i>

03:55.403 --> 03:59.282
<i>It was time
to leave this accursed land,</i>

03:59.449 --> 04:03.369
<i>but their sails hung flabby
as Grandmother's teat.</i>

04:04.495 --> 04:07.248
<i>The wind did not
wish them to leave.</i>

04:08.541 --> 04:10.585
<i>They were becalmed
astride hell.</i>

04:11.586 --> 04:15.423
<i>Lucky they knew
wind can be reasoned with.</i>

04:24.265 --> 04:28.227
<i>The All-Father could intercede
with the wind on their behalf,</i>

04:28.394 --> 04:30.313
<i>but they feared
he would not know</i>

04:30.480 --> 04:32.815
<i>to look this far from home.</i>

04:32.982 --> 04:36.945
<i>They would have
to MAKE him look.</i>

04:52.543 --> 04:54.587
Aargh!

04:56.798 --> 04:58.383
<i>But still...</i>

04:59.759 --> 05:01.302
<i>..no wind.</i>

05:09.727 --> 05:11.938
Heave, ho.

05:12.105 --> 05:13.898
Heave, ho, hum.

05:14.065 --> 05:15.900
Heave.

05:17.986 --> 05:19.404
Heave, ho, hum.

05:19.570 --> 05:22.740
Heave.

05:22.907 --> 05:25.118
Heave, ho.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.954
Heave. Heave.

05:31.499 --> 05:34.127
<i>It was obvious now
what was required.</i>

05:34.293 --> 05:38.256
<i>After all,
their god was a war god.</i>

06:28.264 --> 06:30.516
<i>They left in a hurry,</i>

06:30.683 --> 06:34.187
<i>not bothering to sew their wounds
or burn the dead.</i>

06:34.353 --> 06:36.230
<i>And when they reached
their home shores,</i>

06:36.397 --> 06:38.941
<i>not one of them
ever set foot in a boat</i>

06:39.108 --> 06:42.278
<i>or spoke of that new world
ever again.</i>

06:47.325 --> 06:50.953
Heave, ho, hum.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.334
<i>Over 100 years later,</i>

06:56.501 --> 06:59.212
<i>when Leif the Fortunate,
son of Erik the Red,</i>

06:59.378 --> 07:01.881
<i>would rediscover that land,</i>

07:02.048 --> 07:04.092
<i>he found his god waiting...</i>

07:05.510 --> 07:08.221
<i>..along with his war.</i>

07:09.472 --> 07:14.310
Heave, ho, hum.

07:20.608 --> 07:24.821
<i>Best thing, only good thing
about being in prison,</i>

07:24.987 --> 07:26.948
<i>is the relief.</i>

07:27.115 --> 07:28.991
<i>You don't worry
if they're gonna get you</i>

07:29.158 --> 07:30.535
<i>when they already got you.</i>

07:30.701 --> 07:34.372
<i>Tomorrow can't do anything
today hasn't already managed.</i>

07:34.539 --> 07:36.332
Even better
with a death sentence.

07:36.499 --> 07:39.377
Bam! Worst has already happened.

07:39.544 --> 07:41.587
You get a few days
to let it sink in

07:41.754 --> 07:43.131
and then you're riding the cart

07:43.297 --> 07:45.925
on the way to do
your dance on nothing.

07:46.968 --> 07:49.303
This country went to hell
when they stopped hanging folks.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.807
No gallows dirt,
no gallows deals.

07:52.974 --> 07:55.226
No gallows humour.

07:55.393 --> 07:56.936
Yeah.

08:00.773 --> 08:03.651
Funniest fucking shit
in the world.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.530
You know, I'm not superstitious.

08:07.697 --> 08:09.073
I believe in plenty

08:09.240 --> 08:12.034
when there's reason
and evidence to believe.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.162
I don't believe
in anything I can't see.

08:14.328 --> 08:17.248
I feel like there's a fucking axe
hanging over my head.

08:18.291 --> 08:22.086
No, I can't see it,
but...I believe it.

08:22.253 --> 08:25.298
I can see it fine.

08:25.464 --> 08:29.051
Prison has a way
of trying to keep you IN prison.

08:29.218 --> 08:33.472
They'll do anything they can
to keep you inside with them.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.648
I smell snow.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.663
<i>Hello?</i>

08:57.830 --> 09:00.458
I love you.
Something feels weird.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.419
<i>I love you too.
What feels weird?</i>

09:03.586 --> 09:05.755
I don't know. Um...

09:07.798 --> 09:09.967
..the weather.

09:10.134 --> 09:11.510
The air feels constipated,

09:11.677 --> 09:14.013
like if it'd just push out a storm,
it'd be OK.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.016
<i>It's nice here.</i>

09:17.183 --> 09:18.851
<i>Trees are budding.</i>

09:19.018 --> 09:21.145
<i>There'll be leaves on 'em
when you get back.</i>

09:23.064 --> 09:24.941
Five days.

09:25.107 --> 09:27.235
<i>120 hours till you're home.</i>

09:29.570 --> 09:31.614
Everything's OK there, right?

09:32.657 --> 09:34.825
<i>Waiting for the sky to fall
is gonna cause more bother</i>

09:34.992 --> 09:37.954
<i>than the sky actually falling,
which it isn't.</i>

09:38.996 --> 09:40.831
Yeah. So nothing's wrong?

09:40.998 --> 09:43.501
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

09:43.668 --> 09:45.544
<i>Robbie's coming by.</i>

09:45.711 --> 09:48.714
<i>We're planning your surprise party.
Welcome home.</i>

09:48.881 --> 09:51.342
- A surprise party?
<i>- Which you know nothing about.</i>

09:54.553 --> 09:56.264
Not a thing.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.683
<i>I love you, puppy.</i>

10:00.309 --> 10:02.603
I love you too.

11:01.287 --> 11:03.372
I love you, puppy.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.626
I love you too, baby.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.899
Shadow Moon. This way.

12:40.511 --> 12:42.346
Thank you for coming.

12:42.513 --> 12:43.889
Sit down.

12:44.056 --> 12:45.766
Please.

12:56.193 --> 12:58.070
Says here you were
sentenced to six years

12:58.237 --> 12:59.738
for aggravated assault
and battery.

12:59.905 --> 13:01.699
Yes, sir.

13:01.866 --> 13:05.703
Served three and were due
to be released on Friday.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.289
Shadow, we're gonna
be releasing you

13:08.456 --> 13:09.832
later this afternoon.

13:09.999 --> 13:12.084
You'll be getting out
a couple of days early.

13:13.878 --> 13:16.255
There's no good way to say this,
so I'll be plain.

13:17.882 --> 13:21.469
This came in from Johnson City
Hospital in Eagle Point.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.138
Your wife...

13:24.305 --> 13:26.432
She died in the early hours
of this morning.

13:26.599 --> 13:29.602
Was a...an automobile accident.

13:58.464 --> 14:01.467
It's like one of them good news,
bad news jokes, isn't it?

14:01.634 --> 14:03.427
Good news,
we're letting you out early.

14:03.594 --> 14:05.554
Bad news, your wife's dead.

15:09.994 --> 15:12.079
I'm sorry.
It's our policy.

15:12.246 --> 15:13.622
I can't change your ticket

15:13.789 --> 15:15.708
from two days from now to today.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.501
If you have to change
your departure date

15:17.668 --> 15:19.003
from Friday to today,

15:19.169 --> 15:21.005
it's a $200 change fee,

15:21.171 --> 15:23.090
plus the difference in fare.

15:23.257 --> 15:25.968
- $200?
- Plus the difference in fare.

15:26.135 --> 15:28.053
Do you have to travel today?

15:28.220 --> 15:30.931
I have to get to Eagle Point, yeah.
It's for a funeral.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.559
Not without
an original death certificate.

15:33.726 --> 15:36.604
And there's no emails
and there's no copies.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.281
Do not piss off

15:47.448 --> 15:51.035
those bitches in airports.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.662
Take a lesson from Johnnie Larch.

15:53.829 --> 15:56.707
- Don't know Johnnie Larch.
- He got out after five years.

15:56.874 --> 15:59.293
At the airport, hands his ticket
to the woman at the counter,

15:59.460 --> 16:00.794
who asks
for his driver's licence.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.963
He gives it to her.
She says, "It's expired."

16:03.130 --> 16:05.132
He says, "It might not be
a valid driver's licence,

16:05.299 --> 16:07.134
"but it's a damn fine identification.

16:07.301 --> 16:08.969
"There's my picture,
weight and height.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.679
"Who the fuck you think it is?"

16:10.846 --> 16:13.182
She says, "I'll thank you
for not using that language, sir."

16:13.349 --> 16:15.893
He says, "Give me
my fucking boarding pass

16:16.060 --> 16:17.853
"right fucking now."

16:18.020 --> 16:20.481
Now, he has the right to take
that tone. She disrespected him.

16:20.648 --> 16:22.983
You don't let people
disrespect you in prison.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.487
Why the fuck would he let her
disrespect him as a free man?

16:26.654 --> 16:28.030
Mm-mm.

16:28.197 --> 16:30.366
She hit a button.

16:30.532 --> 16:33.160
Security shows up.
He's back in prison.

16:33.327 --> 16:35.704
You understand
what I'm saying right now?

16:35.871 --> 16:37.289
One of those behaviours
that work

16:37.456 --> 16:39.667
inside a specialised environment
such as a prison,

16:39.833 --> 16:41.502
but doesn't work when
outside such an environment

16:41.669 --> 16:43.045
sort of situation.

16:43.212 --> 16:44.380
No, dummy.

16:44.546 --> 16:48.801
I'm saying
do not piss off

16:48.967 --> 16:52.596
those bitches in airports.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.643
<i>This is
the final boarding call</i>

16:57.810 --> 16:59.269
<i>for Flight 286, Orlando.</i>

16:59.436 --> 17:01.397
<i>Final boarding call, Flight...</i>

17:01.563 --> 17:03.107
How much for a flight tomorrow?

17:33.846 --> 17:36.557
Hey, Robbie.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.394
They tell me Laura's dead.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.272
Let me out early.

17:43.439 --> 17:45.482
Coming home.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.162
I bought it. I d...I did!

17:58.328 --> 18:02.249
I did. I...I've got to get
to my son's christening. Hm?

18:02.416 --> 18:04.793
I...I bought
a first-class ticket.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.296
Sir, this isn't
a first-class ticket.

18:07.463 --> 18:09.047
I...I sent a cheque.

18:09.214 --> 18:12.092
Look, th...there's...
there's my name.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.136
I got to get back.

18:14.303 --> 18:17.556
He was only born two days ago.
We...we named him...

18:17.723 --> 18:19.975
We...we named him...

18:20.142 --> 18:23.187
Sir, are you sure you're
supposed to be travelling alone?

18:23.353 --> 18:25.856
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
My son always travels with me.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.608
He takes care of everything,
all the bills.

18:27.775 --> 18:30.027
I've just got to get back
for his christening

18:30.194 --> 18:31.779
and everything
will be alright.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.363
You know what?

18:33.530 --> 18:36.408
- He...he'll take care of me.
- We're gonna get you in first.

18:36.575 --> 18:39.161
- Get...just get him in first.
- First-class? Thank you.

18:39.328 --> 18:40.913
Yeah, you're gonna go
in first class. OK?

18:41.079 --> 18:42.539
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Don't worry anymore.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.082
- And mind your bag.
- Thank you.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.751
- Watch your step.
- Thank you.

18:45.918 --> 18:47.419
Next. So sorry.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.715
Can you take your seat?

18:51.882 --> 18:53.258
This lady is sitting in it.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.552
5D times two.
Now do you see the problem?

18:55.719 --> 18:59.139
- You need to take another seat.
- Point to one and I'll take it.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.732
Really?

19:10.943 --> 19:14.404
<i>At this time please ensure
seat backs and tray tables...</i>

19:14.571 --> 19:16.824
I guess this must be
your lucky day, huh?

19:16.990 --> 19:19.159
<i>- ..seatbelts...</i>
- Cashews.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.702
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- Love 'em.

19:20.869 --> 19:25.290
Native to Brazil, but grow like
motherfuckers in Florida. Mm!

19:27.084 --> 19:28.544
I'm supposed
to take your drink, sir.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.254
Yeah, but you won't,
'cause you'd have said

19:30.420 --> 19:33.257
"I need to take your drink, sir"
or "I have to take that drink,"

19:33.423 --> 19:36.009
neither of which happened,
so don't worry about it.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.553
I'll hold her very tight

19:37.719 --> 19:39.721
while you pour my friend here
a Jack and Coke

19:39.888 --> 19:41.765
and get me another one, hm?

19:41.932 --> 19:43.308
<i>- Flight attendants...</i>
- Thank you.

19:43.475 --> 19:44.810
<i>..prepare the cabin
for departure.</i>

19:49.481 --> 19:51.400
- Are you nervous?
- Uh...

19:51.567 --> 19:53.777
- Never flown before.
- Nothing to it.

19:53.944 --> 19:55.821
Just sit back, be a bird

19:55.988 --> 19:57.990
and drink up.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.119
I offer you
the worm from my beak,

20:02.286 --> 20:04.246
and you look at me
like I fucked your mom?

20:04.413 --> 20:06.582
Sorry. No. It's...

20:06.748 --> 20:08.375
You're just the first person
I've talked to

20:08.542 --> 20:10.419
who wasn't an asshole.

20:10.586 --> 20:12.045
Give me time.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.797
Oh...

20:15.674 --> 20:17.634
Nice work on the upgrade.

20:17.801 --> 20:19.845
Straight-up sympathy play, huh?

20:21.221 --> 20:22.973
It's risky.

20:23.140 --> 20:25.100
Airlines are
the ultimate clip joint.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.227
They deserve that and worse.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.855
What would YOU have done,
my boy?

20:30.022 --> 20:32.065
Uh, good Samaritan.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.859
You know, gentleman's curve.

20:34.026 --> 20:36.612
- If I was a travelling man.
- Oh, which you are not?

20:36.778 --> 20:38.322
Mm-mm. No, sir, not me.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.616
Seems like a firm decision
made for good reasons.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.492
I respect that -
a man gets out of prison,

20:42.659 --> 20:45.495
he should concentrate above all
on not going back.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.332
Oh, don't worry about me.
I got an eye for these things.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.375
Just the one, but I can see

20:50.542 --> 20:52.127
that you're not used
to the fresh air.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.671
But I don't see the joy
of being out.

20:54.838 --> 20:58.342
Also, you lost something vital
in there, not just time.

20:58.508 --> 21:01.595
What should I call you,
if I were so inclined?

21:02.888 --> 21:05.140
- Shadow Moon.
- Oh, my boy!

21:05.307 --> 21:07.142
That is one outstandingly
improbable name.

21:07.309 --> 21:10.979
Shadow Moon. Moon Shadow.
Goddamn hippie parents.

21:11.146 --> 21:14.775
- Hippie PARENT.
- Mama had a big afro, huh?

21:14.942 --> 21:16.318
'Dancing Queen', hm?

21:16.485 --> 21:18.195
Yeah. She had the whole kit.

21:18.362 --> 21:22.032
And if I was inclined,
what might I call you?

21:22.199 --> 21:24.159
What's today?

21:25.202 --> 21:26.870
- Wednesday.
- Hm...

21:28.080 --> 21:30.207
Today's my day.

21:30.374 --> 21:32.376
Let's go with that, huh?

21:32.542 --> 21:35.253
Thank you so much, darling.

21:35.420 --> 21:38.382
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain in your seats.</i>

21:38.548 --> 21:41.885
Mm. Always good to meet
a fellow traveller, Shadow...

21:42.052 --> 21:44.429
Oh. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.723
But when you were,
what was your downfall?

21:46.890 --> 21:49.226
Uh, casinos.

21:49.393 --> 21:51.103
Oh, bang-bang big time, huh?

21:51.269 --> 21:53.146
Yeah,
and some small time.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.731
Yeah.

21:54.898 --> 21:56.984
Alright...

22:00.529 --> 22:02.280
Ah...

22:02.447 --> 22:04.574
Yeah.
Better at the small than big.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.159
Ah, you got more talent
than me.

22:06.326 --> 22:09.830
I got two. One is
I can sleep anywhere, anytime.

22:09.997 --> 22:12.874
The other one is that I usually
end up getting what I want.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.335
On average, over time.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.130
It's all about getting people
to believe in you.

22:18.296 --> 22:20.007
It's not their cash,
it's their faith.

22:21.591 --> 22:23.427
Well, take this plane,
for example.

22:23.593 --> 22:28.807
This 80-ton chub of metal,
seat cushions and Bloody Mary mix

22:28.974 --> 22:31.518
has no right
to be soaring through the sky.

22:31.685 --> 22:33.270
But along comes Newton,
explains something

22:33.437 --> 22:35.105
about the airflow
over the wing

22:35.272 --> 22:37.107
creating an uplift
or some such shit,

22:37.274 --> 22:39.317
none of which
makes a lick of sense,

22:39.484 --> 22:40.861
but you got 82 passengers
back there

22:41.028 --> 22:42.779
who believe it so fiercely,

22:42.946 --> 22:45.323
the plane continues its journey
safely.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.909
Now, what's keeping us aloft?

22:48.076 --> 22:50.328
Faith or Newton?

22:51.371 --> 22:53.081
Mm!

22:53.248 --> 22:56.710
They give you a free little shit kit
in first class.

22:56.877 --> 22:58.837
You might not have known that.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.673
How you fixed for work?

23:01.840 --> 23:03.884
Who needs work
when you're rich, huh?

23:04.051 --> 23:06.678
Well, I just happen to be
in a hiring position.

23:06.845 --> 23:10.432
And I could be Mr Wednesday
with a shake of the hand.

23:10.599 --> 23:13.560
Perfectly legal work,
for the most part.

23:13.727 --> 23:16.354
Good money, open roads,
no aggravation.

23:16.521 --> 23:18.857
Well, a little bit by and by,
but, uh, you know.

23:19.983 --> 23:22.736
I would have no hesitation
hiring an ex-con.

23:22.903 --> 23:24.946
Don't rush into this.
Take your time, hm?

23:25.113 --> 23:26.490
No, thank you.

23:26.656 --> 23:29.117
But I have a job waiting for me
at my buddy's gym.

23:29.284 --> 23:30.660
No, you don't.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.080
I could use a fellow like you.

23:33.246 --> 23:35.999
There's always work for a big guy
who's smart enough to know

23:36.166 --> 23:38.585
he's better off
letting people think he's dumb.

23:38.752 --> 23:40.504
Oh, by the way,
did I mention the bonuses?

23:40.670 --> 23:42.089
Outstanding benefits.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.049
I'll even throw in a pension
if you'd like

23:44.216 --> 23:46.802
and I can tell you
what the fuck a pension is.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.470
Hell, by the end of your tenure,

23:48.637 --> 23:50.180
you could be
the next king of America.

23:50.347 --> 23:51.723
I told you, I got a job.

23:51.890 --> 23:53.892
Of course, of course. Anyway.

23:54.935 --> 23:57.145
As a wise man once said,

23:57.312 --> 23:58.897
a man gets out of prison,

23:59.064 --> 24:02.567
he should be focused above all
on not going back.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.946
Don't rush into it.

24:06.113 --> 24:07.781
Ah.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.405
Believe.

25:31.823 --> 25:33.366
Sir? Sir?

25:39.956 --> 25:42.792
Oh, great.
I slept through first class.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.794
Sorry. We had to make
an emergency landing.

25:44.961 --> 25:46.755
Can't blame us
for the weather.

25:46.922 --> 25:48.882
I can get you
on a flight tomorrow

25:49.049 --> 25:51.259
that'll get you
into Eagle Point by 6:00.

25:51.426 --> 25:53.261

Are you sure?

28:21.576 --> 28:23.411
I want to see you again.

28:23.578 --> 28:25.372
I know.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.792
I mean, we...we can wait

28:28.958 --> 28:30.835
We will.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.919
You don't think I'm spent?

29:14.504 --> 29:15.880
You're the sexiest
goddamn thing

29:16.047 --> 29:18.425
I've ever gotten
to touch for free.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.562
Mm.

29:30.728 --> 29:34.274
I'm so...
I don't know what I'm doing.

29:34.441 --> 29:36.651
What man does?

29:36.818 --> 29:38.194
Let me...

29:40.613 --> 29:42.991
Oh...

29:46.453 --> 29:49.080
Don't let go. Not yet.

29:52.584 --> 29:54.627
Do something for me.

29:55.670 --> 29:57.672
Worship me.

30:00.675 --> 30:02.427
Stay here.

30:02.594 --> 30:04.888
With your words.

30:05.054 --> 30:06.723
With your body.

30:10.894 --> 30:13.188
Worship me.

30:13.354 --> 30:15.565
Pray to me like I'm your god.

30:15.732 --> 30:18.193
Your goddess.

30:19.986 --> 30:21.571
Don't know how.

30:23.031 --> 30:24.949
Uh, you feel so good.

30:27.911 --> 30:29.412
I could keep fucking you
forever.

30:29.579 --> 30:32.207
Worship me! Say my name!

30:32.373 --> 30:34.042
- Bilquis.
- Again!

30:34.209 --> 30:35.960
Bilquis.

30:39.339 --> 30:42.217
Bilquisss...

30:44.969 --> 30:46.513
Beloved.

30:46.679 --> 30:50.308
I worship your breasts
and your eyes

30:50.475 --> 30:52.268
and your cunt

30:52.435 --> 30:54.646
and I worship your thighs
and your eyes

30:54.812 --> 30:58.149
and your cherry-red lips.

30:59.192 --> 31:01.027
Daughter of the South,

31:01.194 --> 31:04.822
storm queen
on a throne of honey,

31:04.989 --> 31:08.701
secret owner of all gold.

31:08.868 --> 31:12.539
I am yours,
my beloved Bilquis.

31:12.705 --> 31:15.708
Queens and concubines
and maidens

31:15.875 --> 31:18.169
hide their faces in shame
before you,

31:18.336 --> 31:21.798
because you are
the mother of all beauty.

31:21.965 --> 31:25.051
Trees bow and warriors fall.

31:25.218 --> 31:28.012
Give me your blessing.

31:28.179 --> 31:32.267
I bow my head before you
and worship you.

31:32.433 --> 31:35.603
Oh, my God, that's incredible.
What are you doing?

31:35.770 --> 31:37.438
Don't stop, honey.

31:37.605 --> 31:39.566
I offer you everything.

31:39.732 --> 31:42.443
My money, my blood, my life!

31:42.610 --> 31:45.154
Please, I pray that
you give me your gift,

31:45.321 --> 31:47.282
your one pure gift

31:47.448 --> 31:50.910
that I might always be
so...so...

31:51.077 --> 31:52.537
Go on! Let go!

31:52.704 --> 31:54.539
Give me everything.

31:54.706 --> 31:56.124
All that I have!

31:56.291 --> 31:58.334
Everything!

31:58.501 --> 32:00.837
Gift me your body.

32:03.006 --> 32:05.008
I love you.

32:42.253 --> 32:44.547
Hello, kitty.
What can I get you?

32:44.714 --> 32:48.384
Ah, what can I get
for next to nothing?

32:48.551 --> 32:50.720
Buffalo Burger's great.
Chilli's better.

32:50.887 --> 32:53.139
Both together
will make a happy man.

32:53.306 --> 32:54.807
Yeah.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.726
My wife makes a great chilli.

32:56.893 --> 32:59.979
You ain't ever had
chilli like this, kitty.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.565
I got the best chilli
in the state.

33:03.608 --> 33:05.234
I can't afford both
and gas money.

33:05.401 --> 33:06.944
Oh, sure you can.

33:07.111 --> 33:09.697
Just don't make a mess
and stiff me on the tip.

33:09.864 --> 33:12.075
Permission granted.

33:23.086 --> 33:25.963
Not that rushing
into things can't be a good thing.

33:30.802 --> 33:32.303
Sex rushed into

33:32.470 --> 33:34.847
tends to work out best
for all involved.

33:35.014 --> 33:37.350
Marriages, oh, I grant,

33:37.517 --> 33:40.186
may merit an extra moment's
consideration.

33:41.604 --> 33:43.481
Oh, apologies, amigo.

33:43.648 --> 33:45.441
Insensitive of me
to talk about marriage.

33:45.608 --> 33:49.278
I am truly, deeply sorry
about your wife.

33:50.863 --> 33:53.616
Nice obituary, though,
I thought. Hm?

33:53.783 --> 33:55.868
OK, I've said "fuck off"
politely

33:56.035 --> 33:57.412
as many ways as I'm gonna.

33:57.578 --> 33:58.996
Now I'm fixing to be direct.

33:59.163 --> 34:00.998
Don't you want to ask me
about the job?

34:01.165 --> 34:04.544
I don't want your fucking job.

34:04.711 --> 34:06.087
Ask me about the job.

34:06.254 --> 34:07.714
I thought
you'd want to reconsider

34:07.880 --> 34:09.590
on account of your friend
Robbie's condition

34:09.757 --> 34:12.260
and on account
of you being broke.

34:21.853 --> 34:23.688
What about his condition?

34:25.189 --> 34:27.442
The fuck do you know
about Robbie?

34:27.608 --> 34:29.402
More than you, it seems.

34:29.569 --> 34:33.197
Robbie Burton is dead.

Coin tricks, is it?

36:46.914 --> 36:48.624
You're working
for our man, then?

36:50.793 --> 36:53.045
- Who are you?
- I'm a leprechaun.

36:53.212 --> 36:56.090
OK. You're a little tall
for a leprechaun.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.050
That's a stereotype.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.386
Represents a very narrow view
of the world.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.598
So what, you're from Ireland?

37:03.764 --> 37:06.017
I told you I'm a leprechaun.

37:06.183 --> 37:07.852
We don't come
from Moscow, Russia.

37:08.019 --> 37:10.229
Or Moscow, Idaho,
for that matter.

37:16.527 --> 37:18.070
How much has our man told you?

37:20.781 --> 37:23.534
- No details.
- Devil's in the details.

37:24.577 --> 37:27.914
Do you know who he is?
Who he really is?

37:31.000 --> 37:34.420
Well, I never. Mad Sweeney
as I live and breathe.

37:34.587 --> 37:38.132
What a surprise.
Southern Comfort and Coke for you.

37:38.299 --> 37:39.884
Jack Daniel's for me.

37:40.051 --> 37:43.596
And these are for you,
Shadow Moon.

37:47.141 --> 37:50.144
- What is it?
- Ooh...

37:57.485 --> 37:58.903
Tastes like prison hooch,

37:59.070 --> 38:01.155
brewed in a garbage bag
with rotten fruit.

38:01.322 --> 38:04.283
But sweeter,
smoother, stranger.

38:04.450 --> 38:06.452
It's mead. Honey wine.

38:07.495 --> 38:09.205
Drink of heroes,
drink of the gods.

38:09.372 --> 38:11.707
Tastes like
a drunken diabetic's piss.

38:11.874 --> 38:14.669
It's a tradition.
It seals our bargain.

38:14.835 --> 38:17.338
- We don't have a bargain.
- Of course we do.

38:17.505 --> 38:19.256
I won the toss.
You work for me now.

38:19.423 --> 38:22.218
You're my aide-de-camp.
My castellan.

38:22.385 --> 38:23.761
Protect and serve.

38:23.928 --> 38:26.263
You drive
where needs driving to.

38:26.430 --> 38:28.432
You take care of things
generally on my behalf.

38:28.599 --> 38:31.811
And in an emergency -
in an emergency only -

38:31.978 --> 38:35.147
you kick the asses of those
whose asses require kicking.

38:35.314 --> 38:38.317
And in the unlikely event
of my death,

38:38.484 --> 38:40.236
you will hold my vigil.

38:40.403 --> 38:41.988
He's hustling you.

38:42.154 --> 38:44.198
- He's a hustler.
- Damn right.

38:44.365 --> 38:47.159
I'm a hustler, swindler,
cheater and liar.

38:47.326 --> 38:48.786
That's why I need assistance.

38:51.998 --> 38:54.667
You've told me what you want.
Want to know what I want?

38:54.834 --> 38:58.087
Of course I do.
Name your price.

38:58.254 --> 39:01.007
I just want to go
to my wife's funeral.

39:01.173 --> 39:02.758
OK? I just want to say goodbye.

39:02.925 --> 39:06.345
Now after that, yeah, fine,
I'll work for you for $2,000 a week.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.222
You want me to hurt people?

39:09.598 --> 39:13.769
Well, I'll hurt people
if they try and hurt you.

39:13.936 --> 39:16.981
I'm not gonna hurt anyone
for fun or profit.

39:19.358 --> 39:22.153
I'll work for you up to which point
you start to piss me off

39:22.319 --> 39:24.030
and then I'm gone.

39:26.282 --> 39:28.951
Good. We have a compact.

39:29.118 --> 39:31.328
The second seals the deal.

39:31.495 --> 39:34.040
The third is the charm
and we're done.

39:53.517 --> 39:55.603
There.

39:58.564 --> 40:00.733
You're my man now.

40:08.074 --> 40:09.950
Ah...

40:11.911 --> 40:13.496
It'll be heads.

40:20.127 --> 40:22.213
Well, if it's coin tricks
we're doing...

40:23.255 --> 40:24.673
..watch this.

40:53.285 --> 40:55.329
Now that's a coin trick
for you.

40:58.332 --> 41:00.751
- How'd you do it?
- With panache.

41:00.918 --> 41:03.462
So what, you loaded
coins up your sleeves?

41:03.629 --> 41:05.756
Sounds like a lot of work to me.

41:05.923 --> 41:08.384
It's easier just to pluck 'em
out of the air.

41:08.551 --> 41:10.219
Simplest trick in the world.

41:10.386 --> 41:12.638
- How'd you do it?
- Tell you what.

41:16.016 --> 41:17.560
I'll fight you for it.

41:18.853 --> 41:21.313
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.069
Come on.

41:31.532 --> 41:33.617
I'm not fighting you.

41:40.124 --> 41:42.835
Real gold, if you're wondering.

41:43.002 --> 41:44.753
Win or lose...

41:44.920 --> 41:45.921
..and you're gonna lose -

41:46.088 --> 41:47.590
it's yours if you fight me.

41:47.756 --> 41:49.466
He said he doesn't want
to fight you.

41:49.633 --> 41:52.178
Come on. Big fella like you.

41:53.220 --> 41:55.890
Who'd have thought
you'd be a fucking coward?

42:02.521 --> 42:04.857
Whiff of death on the page.

42:06.734 --> 42:08.485
Laura Moon.

42:10.196 --> 42:11.864
Oh. Is...

42:12.907 --> 42:15.659
Is this your old lady's obituary?

42:17.411 --> 42:19.538
She was a fine...

42:30.591 --> 42:31.967
Hey, everybody!

42:32.134 --> 42:34.386
There's gonna be
a lesson learned!

42:35.512 --> 42:37.181
Watch this.

43:13.717 --> 43:15.219
Attaboy.

43:15.386 --> 43:17.680
Now you're fighting
for the joy of it,

43:17.846 --> 43:20.599
for the sheer unholy
fucking delight of it!

43:42.288 --> 43:45.082
Can you feel the joy
rising in your veins

43:45.249 --> 43:47.626
like the sap
in the springtime?

43:52.464 --> 43:54.300
We're done.

44:06.478 --> 44:08.605
It ain't over till I say it is.

44:28.751 --> 44:30.753
You may have drank a lot.

44:30.919 --> 44:33.422
Let it come back to you.

44:34.965 --> 44:36.675
So what do you know, huh?

44:36.842 --> 44:38.677
I know I'm in pain.

44:39.970 --> 44:41.513
And I know
I recently said yes

44:41.680 --> 44:43.057
to something stupid.

44:43.223 --> 44:45.267
That may be true.

44:49.730 --> 44:52.149
Did he teach me that trick?

44:52.316 --> 44:54.151
You know what, I believe he did.

44:54.318 --> 44:56.612
- Don't suppose you heard him?
- No such luck.

44:58.739 --> 45:01.325
- Where's my car?
- Oh, I dumped it.

45:01.492 --> 45:03.911
Red's not your colour.
And don't get used to this.

45:04.078 --> 45:06.538
You're going to be driving Betty here
from now on.

45:06.705 --> 45:08.749
I just thought
you could use some sleep.

45:09.792 --> 45:12.419
It's not every day
a man gets to bury his wife.

45:51.875 --> 45:54.545
I have preparations and
communications to keep me busy,

45:54.711 --> 45:56.213
after which
I will entertain myself.

45:56.380 --> 46:00.843
Now I'll tell you this once
and once only EVER.

46:02.469 --> 46:04.763
Take all the time you need.

47:14.416 --> 47:20.380

47:20.547 --> 47:23.884

- Audrey!
- Well...

47:31.767 --> 47:34.728
Not the reunion
you were hoping for.

47:36.355 --> 47:38.607
Well, she looks pretty.

47:39.650 --> 47:41.360
They did a hell of a job

47:41.527 --> 47:43.695
reconstructing
her face and neck.

47:43.862 --> 47:46.698
I think that and the coffin
just killed your savings.

47:46.865 --> 47:49.910
All so you could have
that nice open casket,

47:50.077 --> 47:52.204
get one last look
at her pretty face.

47:52.371 --> 47:54.206
I'm sorry about Robbie, OK?

47:54.373 --> 47:55.832
He was a really good friend

47:55.999 --> 47:57.834
and I know he loved you
like crazy.

47:58.001 --> 47:59.378

What did you do, Laura?

49:26.673 --> 49:28.634
Wha...what was it?

49:28.800 --> 49:31.928
Was it a one-time thing
the night before I got back?

49:33.263 --> 49:34.681
Ah, that's...

49:34.848 --> 49:36.725
That's a "we're in this together" thing.

49:36.892 --> 49:39.478
Was it love? If you were gonna leave,
you could have told me.

49:39.645 --> 49:41.772
OK? I could've taken it.

49:41.938 --> 49:43.857
You know,
I had a surprise for you.

49:44.024 --> 49:46.443
I read when I was in.

49:47.986 --> 49:50.072
Mainly history.

49:51.114 --> 49:53.825
Six books a week
for three years.

49:55.035 --> 49:57.287
813 books.

49:58.455 --> 50:01.333
8 and 13 - Fibonacci numbers.

50:02.376 --> 50:03.710
And I know that why?

50:03.877 --> 50:05.545
Because four of them
were about math.

50:05.712 --> 50:07.839
I like math. Who knew?

50:12.302 --> 50:14.930
I just wanted to come back
better than when I went in...

50:15.972 --> 50:17.391
..for you.

50:17.557 --> 50:20.268
I wanted to be a part
of your history.

50:26.525 --> 50:28.527
God damn it, Laura.

50:44.918 --> 50:46.920
Two funerals in a day.

50:47.087 --> 50:48.964
Husband and best friend.

50:49.131 --> 50:50.757
But you skipped Robbie's.

50:50.924 --> 50:52.634
- That's fair.
- Audrey...

50:52.801 --> 50:55.220
I was yelling at mine too.
It doesn't do any good.

50:55.387 --> 50:59.558
It's just anger makes you feel
like you can change the outcome.

50:59.725 --> 51:04.730
But there's no arguing
with dead, no debate,

51:04.896 --> 51:07.691
because dead wins
10 out of 10.

51:07.858 --> 51:10.068
So I pissed on him.

51:10.235 --> 51:11.611
How long were they...?

51:11.778 --> 51:16.450
Not sure. Long time,
now that I put things together.

51:16.616 --> 51:19.828
Late nights, daytime showers.

51:19.995 --> 51:21.455
Dickless piece of shit!

51:21.621 --> 51:23.331
That's not an epithet.

51:23.498 --> 51:25.751
That is a literal description.

51:25.917 --> 51:28.378
Severed at the root
in the crash.

51:28.545 --> 51:30.547
Coroner had the nerve to ask me

51:30.714 --> 51:32.758
what I wanted him
to do with it.

51:32.924 --> 51:35.218
I told him
leave it where he found it.

51:36.887 --> 51:40.432
Relax. They didn't bury Laura
with it still in her mouth.

51:40.599 --> 51:42.768
I had him put it
somewhere special.

51:42.934 --> 51:45.228
Don't listen to me, Shadow.

51:45.395 --> 51:47.522
I lost count on the Ativan.

51:47.689 --> 51:50.233
I'm interrupting.
You were saying your piece.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.903
No, I'm not.
People did enough talking today.

51:54.196 --> 51:56.740
I think someone actually said
she's in a better place.

51:56.907 --> 51:58.909
She's in Parkview Cemetery.

51:59.075 --> 52:01.495
Target would be
more interesting than here.

52:01.661 --> 52:04.289
If there isn't some kind
of life after death,

52:04.456 --> 52:07.459
I'm gonna be SO pissed.

52:10.045 --> 52:12.464
Kicked fucking puppy.

52:12.631 --> 52:14.549
I hated you guys as a couple
'cause of this,

52:14.716 --> 52:16.885
the way that you...
you looked at her.

52:17.052 --> 52:20.096
Robbie did his best
to avoid looking at me.

52:20.263 --> 52:22.307
Get used to the boot, puppy.

52:22.474 --> 52:24.226
There is no closure
from the dead.

52:24.392 --> 52:26.186
Maybe, you know,
three years from now,

52:26.353 --> 52:29.773
some therapist will tell you,
"Write her a letter

52:29.940 --> 52:32.567
"saying everything
you wish you could say to her

52:32.734 --> 52:34.402
"and drop it in the ocean

52:34.569 --> 52:36.363
"and maybe it'll help."

52:36.530 --> 52:38.198
It won't help.

52:40.116 --> 52:42.702
I'm sorry for your loss,
Shadow.

52:43.954 --> 52:45.956
I really am.

52:46.122 --> 52:48.500
Anyone tell you that yet?

52:49.501 --> 52:50.836
I'm not sure.

52:51.002 --> 52:53.296
Oh. Anyone even hug you?

52:53.463 --> 52:55.215
Shit. Well, you just
got out of prison.

52:55.382 --> 52:57.509
- You haven't been hugged in...
- ..how long?

52:57.676 --> 53:00.387
I read that's a thing
with ex-cons,

53:00.554 --> 53:03.056
forgetting what it's like
just to feel someone.

53:13.066 --> 53:16.069
Oh, shit. You...
you worked out in prison.

53:22.075 --> 53:25.203
I have a proposal for closure
for us both.

53:25.370 --> 53:27.038
- Audrey...
- No, no. Hear me out.

53:27.205 --> 53:29.624
This is a good one.
Lex talionis.

53:29.791 --> 53:32.168
An eye for an eye,
blowjob for a blowjob.

53:32.335 --> 53:34.337
Right here
where they can see us.

53:34.504 --> 53:37.507
- I appreciate the offer, but...
- My husband and your wife!

53:37.674 --> 53:39.759
My best friend!

53:39.926 --> 53:42.012
I want them to see it.

53:42.178 --> 53:43.805
I want Robbie to watch

53:43.972 --> 53:46.558
while I take this gorgeous man's cock
in my mouth.

53:46.725 --> 53:48.393
Pissing on him wasn't enough.

53:48.560 --> 53:50.312
I want you to come in my mouth.

53:50.478 --> 53:51.855
I'm gonna spit it on his grave.

53:52.022 --> 53:54.065
Jesus, who knew
I could be so angry?

53:55.108 --> 53:57.027
No, no, no. Stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

53:57.193 --> 53:59.404
You're right. Fuck me already.

53:59.571 --> 54:02.866
Don't, Audrey. I can't...

54:03.033 --> 54:04.993
I'm trying to get my dignity
back here!

54:05.160 --> 54:06.995
Hold on.

54:07.162 --> 54:08.622
Wait. Audrey!

56:09.242 --> 56:11.036
Hello, Shadow.

56:15.707 --> 56:17.375
Don't fuck with me.

56:19.419 --> 56:21.004
OK.

56:22.047 --> 56:23.798
I won't.

56:25.717 --> 56:28.511
Uh, but if you could just drop me off
at the Motel America...

56:28.678 --> 56:30.221
Hit him.

56:38.396 --> 56:40.774
I said don't fuck with me.
Now, that was fucking with me.

56:40.940 --> 56:42.901
Keep your answers short
and to the point

56:43.068 --> 56:44.861
or I will fucking kill you.

56:45.028 --> 56:47.655
Or maybe I won't, maybe
I'll just have the Children here

56:47.822 --> 56:49.491
break every bone
in your fucking body.

56:49.657 --> 56:51.868
So don't fuck with me.

56:53.953 --> 56:56.748
- Got it.
- You're working for Wednesday.

56:56.915 --> 56:58.792
Yeah.

57:00.543 --> 57:03.421
- Smoke?
- No, thank you.

57:18.561 --> 57:21.648
Well, it's not tobacco
and it ain't weed.

57:21.815 --> 57:24.067
It smells
like an appliance fire.

57:24.234 --> 57:25.819
Synthetic toad skins.

57:28.279 --> 57:30.031
Hm.

57:30.198 --> 57:32.033
What the fuck is Wednesday after?
What's he doing here?

57:32.200 --> 57:34.786
There's got to be a plan.
What's the game plan, man?

57:34.953 --> 57:37.122
I started working
for Mr Wednesday this morning.

57:37.288 --> 57:38.623
How auspicious.
You must be special.

57:38.790 --> 57:41.000
- No, I'm just an errand boy.
- Is that all?

57:44.003 --> 57:45.588
Wednesday is history.

57:46.631 --> 57:49.717
Forgotten and...old.

57:49.884 --> 57:53.179
He should just let it happen.
We are the future.

57:53.346 --> 57:55.890
We don't give a fuck about him
or anyone like him anymore.

57:56.057 --> 57:57.725
They are consigned
to the dumpster.

57:57.892 --> 58:00.687
Now we have
reprogrammed reality.

58:00.854 --> 58:03.273
Language is a virus,
religion an operating system

58:03.439 --> 58:06.442
and prayers are just
so much fucking spam.

58:06.609 --> 58:08.736
OK, well,
you're saying all this

58:08.903 --> 58:11.364
like I'm supposed to know
what the fuck you're talking about.

58:11.531 --> 58:13.491
The dominant fucking paradigm,
Shadow.

58:13.658 --> 58:15.285
That is the only
important thing.

58:15.451 --> 58:19.164
By the way, I was sorry to hear
about your wife. Tough break.

58:20.665 --> 58:23.960
- Thanks.
- So I will ask again.

58:24.127 --> 58:27.046
What is it Wednesday is up to?

58:27.213 --> 58:28.715
We've barely exchanged
a dozen words.

58:28.882 --> 58:30.717
You can let me out here.
I'll walk the rest.

58:30.884 --> 58:32.886
- You're saying you don't know?
- Telling you I don't know.

58:33.052 --> 58:35.263
Would you tell me
even if you did?

58:35.430 --> 58:36.806
Probably not.

58:36.973 --> 58:38.683
As you say,
I work for Mr Wednesday.

58:40.226 --> 58:43.271
Well, then why the fuck
am I wasting my time

58:43.438 --> 58:44.898
sitting here talking to you?

58:45.064 --> 58:46.482
You know, I was curious myself

58:46.649 --> 58:48.693
how long you'd go on
sucking your own dick.

58:54.699 --> 58:56.659
Kill him.

59:02.582 --> 59:04.417
We're not just going
to kill you, Shadow.

59:04.584 --> 59:06.586
We're going to delete you.

59:06.753 --> 59:09.881
One click
and you are overwritten.

59:10.048 --> 59:12.217
Undelete...

59:12.383 --> 59:13.843
..that is not an option.
