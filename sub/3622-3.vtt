WEBVTT

00:05.105 --> 00:06.905
<i>Thanks for the ride,</i>

00:06.907 --> 00:07.873
Colonel Dimitri.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.241
This is our stop.

00:10.777 --> 00:12.578
Uh, for once, can't we just land

00:12.580 --> 00:14.747
and, like, taxi to a gate,
or something?

00:14.749 --> 00:17.683
Please.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.518
I hope we're not too late.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.254
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:35.201 --> 00:36.235
( <i>bell rings</i> )

00:36.237 --> 00:37.803
Kim, where have you been?

00:37.805 --> 00:38.804
Ruthless dictator.

00:38.806 --> 00:39.772
Don't ask.

00:39.774 --> 00:41.173
Registration for electives

00:41.175 --> 00:42.741
started, like, forever ago.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.209
Tell me there are still spots

00:44.211 --> 00:45.611
in photography class.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.046
Girl, they're filling up fast.

00:47.048 --> 00:48.280
RON:
Hey, guys!

00:48.282 --> 00:51.617
Hello. A little help up here.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.086
Come on, come on,

00:54.088 --> 00:55.120
photography.

00:55.122 --> 00:56.221
Kim, Kim, Kim.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.756
You need a backup.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.858
And a backup for your backup.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.661
Now, see, photography
is my third choice.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.762
So even if kickboxing

01:03.764 --> 01:05.731
and interpretative dance
are full,

01:05.733 --> 01:06.732
I'm still golden.

01:06.734 --> 01:07.933
Congratulate me, Kim.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.068
I got the very last spot

01:09.070 --> 01:10.035
in photography.

01:10.037 --> 01:11.103
Photography is full?

01:11.105 --> 01:12.771
Is now.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.673
I would've preferred
interpretative dance

01:14.675 --> 01:16.742
or kickboxing,
but they were already closed.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.678
Well, then what's left?

01:19.680 --> 01:21.947
Home economics?

01:21.949 --> 01:23.882
They can't be serious.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.217
Yeah, financial planning?

01:25.219 --> 01:27.119
Mm-mmm, no, yeah, never been
one of my strong suits.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.054
It's worse than that, Ron.

01:29.056 --> 01:31.356
It's cooking.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.725
The disappointment
I feel in you

02:39.727 --> 02:41.660
is immeasurable, Junior.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.896
However, I will be
the first to admit

02:43.898 --> 02:45.297
that it is not your fault.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.198
It is not?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.933
There are no bad students,

02:47.935 --> 02:49.768
only bad teachers.

02:49.770 --> 02:53.172
If you have failed to become
a competent super villain,

02:53.174 --> 02:54.840
it's because I have failed

02:54.842 --> 02:56.141
to reach you.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.143
Fine. I do not hold a grudge.

02:58.145 --> 03:01.113
To remedy this,
I have secured the services

03:01.115 --> 03:02.915
of a qualified tutor.

03:02.917 --> 03:03.949
A tutor?

03:03.951 --> 03:05.384
You mean like
the nice lady you hired

03:05.386 --> 03:07.920
to do all my homework
in grades K through 12?

03:07.922 --> 03:09.688
No, my son, no.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.823
Not like Miss Bunny.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.792
A tutor in villainy.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.763
Could you move?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.431
You're blocking my sun.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.903
Lesson one... eyes wide.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.772
Especially to people

03:26.774 --> 03:28.840
who can hurt you.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.375
Home Ec?

03:30.377 --> 03:32.144
I can't believe we got stuck

03:32.146 --> 03:33.779
with such a lame elective.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.013
Yeah.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.082
Hey, I wonder if we get
to eat what we make?

03:37.084 --> 03:40.219
( <i>hinges squeaking</i> )

03:40.221 --> 03:41.753
Where is everybody?

03:41.755 --> 03:42.988
We <i>ar</i> everybody.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.457
( <i>squeaking</i> )

03:46.926 --> 03:48.894
Listen up, people.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.029
The regular Home Ec teacher
retired six years ago,

03:51.031 --> 03:51.964
and nobody noticed

03:51.966 --> 03:53.365
until this morning.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.834
So, I'll be covering this class.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.269
Uh, where is the class?

03:57.271 --> 03:59.037
( <i>groans</i> )

03:59.039 --> 04:01.106
All right, take your dusty

04:01.108 --> 04:03.308
and filth-covered seats, please.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.180
Let's get started.

04:08.182 --> 04:09.481
The first thing that every

04:09.483 --> 04:11.216
good villain needs is...?

04:11.218 --> 04:13.085
( <i>disco music playing</i>)

04:13.087 --> 04:14.853
( <i>frustrated yell</i> )

04:14.855 --> 04:16.421
Hey! I was listening to that.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.790
Yeah, and now
you're listening to me.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.359
Now, the first thing
that every villain

04:20.361 --> 04:21.960
needs is...

04:21.962 --> 04:23.161
I know this one.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.429
An evil laugh.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.797
Oh, for crying out...

04:25.799 --> 04:27.332
Your old man has totally
warped your mind.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.800
Try again.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.136
Uh, a villainous calling card?

04:31.138 --> 04:33.005
A robust tan?

04:33.007 --> 04:34.406
Spinning tops of doom?

04:35.908 --> 04:37.809
You're going to slash something
again, aren't you?

04:37.811 --> 04:39.278
( <i>frustrated groan</i> )

04:39.280 --> 04:42.381
The first thing
that every villain needs

04:42.383 --> 04:45.217
is the basic tools
of the trade.

04:45.219 --> 04:47.019
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Now, follow me.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.021
We're going
on a little field trip.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.356
All right, the first thing
every chef needs

04:51.358 --> 04:53.191
is the basic tools
of the trade...

04:53.193 --> 04:55.127
your helmet
and trenching shovel.

04:55.129 --> 04:57.029
Uh, Mr. B.... question.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.131
If you must, Stoppable.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.300
Would you mind...
could I ask you where you,

05:01.302 --> 05:03.068
you know, um, learned to cook?

05:03.070 --> 05:07.039
It was 30 clicks
southeast of Jai Alai.

05:07.041 --> 05:10.509
Lieutenant Barkin,
when do we chow?

05:10.511 --> 05:12.477
Soon as I catch something, sir.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.979
( <i>monkey screeches</i> )

05:15.548 --> 05:17.482
How else would you learn
the slapjacky's art?

05:17.484 --> 05:19.184
Well, when I was eight,

05:19.186 --> 05:21.586
my mom got me a Granny Crockett
Quickie-Bake mixer and oven set.

05:21.588 --> 05:22.988
Really?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.456
You know, I don't mean to brag,

05:24.458 --> 05:26.124
<i>but my caramel turtle brownies</i>

05:26.126 --> 05:28.193
<i>were a real hit</i>
<i>amongst all my friends.</i>

05:30.830 --> 05:34.099
All right, Granny's boy,
let's see what you can do.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.107
Huh?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.412
( <i>bell dings</i> )

05:49.549 --> 05:51.216
Mmm! Yummy.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.552
( <i>sniffing</i> )

05:53.554 --> 05:55.954
Mmm.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.923
Impressive, Stoppable.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.592
Possible, let's get cooking.

06:01.461 --> 06:03.128
No big.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.199
Hmm. Oh...!

06:09.402 --> 06:11.036
( <i>high-pitched whirring</i> )

06:11.038 --> 06:12.170
( <i>yelling</i> )

06:12.172 --> 06:14.539
Ow! Ow! Ow!

06:20.046 --> 06:21.213
Could we not just

06:21.215 --> 06:22.180
buy these items?

06:22.182 --> 06:25.484
criminals don't <i>buy</i> anything.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.655
Besides, this gives you
something money can't buy...

06:30.657 --> 06:32.991
experience.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.595
Let's see, there's "mix, blend,
beat, cream, knead, churn..."

06:36.597 --> 06:39.898
Oh, here...
"whip" ought to do it. Ah!

06:39.900 --> 06:40.966
( <i>grunting</i>)

06:40.968 --> 06:42.300
( <i>annoyed groan</i>)

06:42.302 --> 06:44.102
( <i>frustrated growl</i> )

06:44.104 --> 06:45.404
Whoopsie?

06:45.406 --> 06:47.939
Maybe a more competent student

06:47.941 --> 06:50.609
can tell you what
you're doing wrong.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.010
Stoppable.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.113
Be glad to, Mr. B.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.416
For someone who can
disarm a doomsday device,

06:57.418 --> 06:59.151
you seem to have
major mixer issues.

06:59.153 --> 07:01.086
Ron, this machine hates me.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.256
It senses your fear.

07:04.957 --> 07:06.191
Watch me.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.093
( <i>whirring smoothly</i> )

07:08.095 --> 07:09.594
Let the beating of the blades

07:09.596 --> 07:12.264
and the beating of your heart
merge together.

07:12.266 --> 07:16.301
You and the mixer become one.

07:16.303 --> 07:19.438
Now you try, and tell
me what you feel.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.009
( <i>ragged whirring</i> )

07:24.011 --> 07:25.610
I feel ridiculous.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.346
That, Kim, is why you fail.

07:28.348 --> 07:31.983
( <i>shutters clicking</i> )

07:31.985 --> 07:34.352
Take me... with you.

07:34.354 --> 07:37.689
It's like a chocolate cloud.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.524
Yes, I was going for cloud.

07:39.526 --> 07:40.625
Well, that settles it.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.160
I am officially

07:42.162 --> 07:43.962
turning this class over to you.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.730
A-boo-ya!

07:45.732 --> 07:47.732
Wade, code red.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.100
Ron is now

07:49.102 --> 07:50.302
teaching our class.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.736
Tell me somebody somewhere

07:51.738 --> 07:53.271
needs my help.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.307
Actually,
it's been pretty quiet.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.441
Come on.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.043
A cat stuck in a tree?

07:58.045 --> 07:59.444
Anything.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.613
I've got a series of robberies
in Europe,

08:01.615 --> 08:03.715
but it looks
strictly small-time.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.016
Sold. I'll take it.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.152
As long
as it doesn't involve baking.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.720
I don't understand it.

08:08.722 --> 08:12.190
All they took was two pair
of infrared goggles.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.359
Two coils of climbing rope.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.760
Two grappling hooks.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.562
Two parachutes.

08:17.564 --> 08:20.432
All of it...
every last jar.

08:20.434 --> 08:23.134
Oh, my <i>pauvre Le Goop!</i>

08:23.136 --> 08:25.704
Le Goop?
Hmm... a clue.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.672
I caught a glimpse of them.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.242
There was a boy...
tall, handsome,

08:30.244 --> 08:32.310
but a few crepes short
of a Suzette, eh?

08:32.312 --> 08:33.411
Let me guess.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.180
He was with an older gentleman...

08:35.182 --> 08:36.314
strong family resemblance?

08:36.316 --> 08:37.649
<i>Oh, mais non, mais non.</i>

08:37.651 --> 08:38.717
A young lady.

08:38.719 --> 08:42.220
She had thick,
glowing green hands.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.656
Shego and Junior...
together?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.358
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.227
Okay, hair care
was not on the list.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.395
I have the cowlick issues.

08:50.397 --> 08:53.298
Yeah, uh, fine. Whatever.

08:53.300 --> 08:57.068
Okay, you're ready for the next
and most important step.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.204
Every villain
needs an evil plot.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.772
Take Drakken.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.708
His plot? Yeah,
always taking over the world.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.143
Always.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.077
Ooh, can we do that?

09:06.079 --> 09:07.078
No, you got to walk

09:07.080 --> 09:08.280
before you can run, sport.

09:08.282 --> 09:09.281
Let's start small.

09:09.283 --> 09:11.216
Oh! How about more thieving?

09:11.218 --> 09:12.384
Good answer.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.153
It would have to be
something valuable

09:15.155 --> 09:16.621
and heavily guarded.

09:16.623 --> 09:18.590
Let's see.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.158
Almost got something;
hold on.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.293
No, no, don't say a word.

09:21.295 --> 09:22.460
It's on the tip of my tongue.

09:22.462 --> 09:23.628
I got it.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.796
Hello.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.164
I thought I'd look in

09:26.166 --> 09:27.265
and see how you kids are doing.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.266
I lost it.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.701
Oh! Father...!

09:29.703 --> 09:31.536
If I've come at a bad time...

09:31.538 --> 09:33.238
Well, yeah, yeah, you did.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.073
Okay, yeah, you know what?

09:35.075 --> 09:36.675
Thanks for stopping by.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.078
Maybe we just run a web search

09:40.080 --> 09:42.647
for "really valuable
and heavily guarded."

09:42.649 --> 09:45.150
O... kay.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.085
I am learning from the best.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.386
Mm-hmm. Mmm...

09:48.388 --> 09:49.854
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.356
Yes!

09:51.358 --> 09:53.458
Sweet!

09:58.197 --> 10:02.133
( <i>crickets chirping</i> )

10:02.135 --> 10:03.735
Um... isn't it lunchtime?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.337
Yep.
Okay.

10:05.339 --> 10:06.471
Where is everybody?

10:06.473 --> 10:07.539
The Home Ec room.

10:07.541 --> 10:09.274
I got a 12:45
reservation myself.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.709
Oh, got to run.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.644
Reservation?

10:12.646 --> 10:14.112
Excuse me.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.847
E-E-Excuse me.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.382
Can I get through here?

10:17.384 --> 10:18.717
Some of us actually
take this class.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.784
( <i>gasps</i> )

10:19.786 --> 10:21.686
Rufus?
Hmm.

10:21.688 --> 10:22.420
How many?

10:22.422 --> 10:23.888
Huh?

10:23.890 --> 10:25.256
( <i>crowd gasping</i> )

10:25.258 --> 10:27.425
I call it seven layers...

10:27.427 --> 10:29.227
of heaven.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.895
( <i>applause and cheers</i>)

10:30.897 --> 10:33.398
Mr. Barkin, what's
going on here?

10:33.400 --> 10:35.533
World-class dining,
that's what.

10:35.535 --> 10:39.404
Um, but the cafeteria,
it's totally empty right now.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.639
Good point.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.741
I guess it would make
more sense if I just put

10:42.743 --> 10:44.776
Chef Rinald here
in charge of food serves

10:44.778 --> 10:46.277
for the whole school.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.146
"Chef Rinald"?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.448
This is so wrong.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.150
Now, don't worry, Possible.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.519
You'll get class credit
by assisting him.

10:54.521 --> 10:55.887
Somebody's got to do the dishes.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.422
Not likely!

10:57.424 --> 10:58.790
Guess you're right, Possible.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.258
Thank you.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.426
Not without your hair net.

Yah!

11:09.670 --> 11:11.670
SENIOR:
Ah, did I not warn you

11:11.672 --> 11:14.239
that he would be
a difficult pupil?

11:14.241 --> 11:15.740
Actually, he's a
pretty good listener,

11:15.742 --> 11:16.808
once you get his attention.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.443
Junior? My son?

11:18.445 --> 11:20.245
He certainly never
listened to...

11:20.247 --> 11:21.446
Love to chat, can't.

11:21.448 --> 11:22.814
Kind of busy here, Pops.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.449
( <i>sighs</i> )

11:24.451 --> 11:26.951
Oh, very well.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.487
Now, time for a little cinnamon

11:29.489 --> 11:31.756
and y'all know what that mean.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.191
Boo-yah!

11:33.193 --> 11:35.360
( <i>chanting</i> ):
Boo-yah!

11:35.362 --> 11:37.328
We're out of the lamb

11:37.330 --> 11:38.563
but I recommend the stroganoff.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.798
( <i>camera clicking</i> )

11:39.800 --> 11:41.299
Guess what, Kim?

11:41.301 --> 11:43.368
You're going to be my final
project for Photography.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.203
It's a photo essay I call

11:45.205 --> 11:47.272
"Fashion Never Evers."

11:47.274 --> 11:48.640
( <i>beeping</i> )

11:48.642 --> 11:51.242
Hey, Wade, what's the deal
on Shego and Junior?

11:51.244 --> 11:52.744
What's the deal on your hair.

11:52.746 --> 11:53.778
Nothing!

11:53.780 --> 11:55.613
Shego? Junior?

11:55.615 --> 11:57.482
Okay, I just found something
that might interest you.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.616
I'll fax it.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.285
Cool. Thanks, Wade.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.654
Huh?

Pretty good time...

for a wounded tortoise.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.752
Junior,

12:33.754 --> 12:37.555
how about you and I work on
our evil laughs together, huh?

12:37.557 --> 12:39.424
Just like we used to?

12:39.426 --> 12:40.792
Oh, Father, please!

12:40.794 --> 12:42.560
Can't you see
I'm a wounded porpoise?

12:42.562 --> 12:44.496
SHEGO: Yeah, no, I
said, "tortoise."

12:44.498 --> 12:46.664
T-T-Tortoise.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.666
See, Father, how
mixed up you make me?

12:48.668 --> 12:51.402
( <i>sighs</i> )

12:53.272 --> 12:54.038
Let's see.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.640
For tomorrow I'm feeling...

12:55.642 --> 12:56.808
chickeny.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.446
<i>Villains Digest.</i>

13:01.448 --> 13:03.515

their own magazine?

by Senor Senior, Sr.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.292
I bet my meals are better.

Hey, focus, Ron.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.628
Tutor wanted, get it?

13:16.630 --> 13:18.596
That explains what Shego
is doing with Junior.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.799
Hey...

13:20.801 --> 13:24.002
she's tutoring him just like
I'm tutoring you in Home Ec.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.670
Yeah.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.438
Great.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.007
So, now we just have
to figure out

13:29.009 --> 13:30.675
what she's tutoring him for.

13:30.677 --> 13:31.743
Huh?

Hmm.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.011
That was...

14:07.013 --> 14:08.880
perfect, Junior!

14:08.882 --> 14:10.548
You're ready for the real deal.

14:18.724 --> 14:20.725
The Seniors are all about
the challenge.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.861
They only go for stuff
that's really valuable

14:22.863 --> 14:23.962
and heavily guarded.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.697
You know, we could just
run a web search

14:25.699 --> 14:28.533
on the words "really valuable"
and "heavily guarded."

14:28.535 --> 14:30.835
Ron... we're talking
a devious criminal mind here.

14:30.837 --> 14:31.970
It's not as simple as...

14:31.972 --> 14:33.071
WADE:
Got it!

14:33.073 --> 14:34.439
Great idea, Ron.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.640
I can cook, too.

14:35.642 --> 14:36.808

So the most heavily
guarded thing in the world

is a cookie recipe?

this isn't just any recipe.

Y'all can relax, darlin'.

Well, hey, Granny.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.622
Granny Crocket?
No!

to be Granny Crocket.

Well...

you doing in the dark?

Actually, they have their
own European island.

that's all I now.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.792
Bring 'em on.

guarded as can be.

to that cookie recipe

16:53.079 --> 16:55.046
before Shego and Junior do.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.055
Good, right on schedule.
Hold it right there!

This is a very strange
secret recipe.

What?

17:59.045 --> 18:00.645
"You are so busted."

18:00.647 --> 18:04.182
Shouldn't there be some mention
of flour, or eggs?

18:04.184 --> 18:05.083
Let me see that.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.317
This isn't...

some new moves.

new moves, too.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.853
It's very satisfying.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.356
( <i>sighs</i> )

19:20.926 --> 19:22.894
Ooh, smell that?

19:22.896 --> 19:23.895
Vanilla.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.696
Mmm. 'Nilla.

( <i>yelling</i> )

19:29.001 --> 19:30.201
No where to run, Ron Stoppable.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.903
Let me show you
some other things

19:31.905 --> 19:34.172
I have learned.

( <i>Kim grunting</i>)

19:56.196 --> 19:58.696
Huh, 14 settings to choose from.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.165
How does whipped Possible
sound to you?

20:01.167 --> 20:02.900
Ooh, or maybe minced Possible.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.903
Fourteen settings?

20:05.905 --> 20:06.904
You know what,

20:06.906 --> 20:09.173
a Kimmie frappe
sounds just right.

20:09.175 --> 20:10.241
( <i>gasps</i> )

20:12.811 --> 20:13.811
Aah!

20:13.813 --> 20:16.080
Have a nice spin.

( <i>Kim coughs</i> )

20:21.821 --> 20:24.322
Kim, do not fear the mixer.

20:24.324 --> 20:27.792
Let the beating of the blades

20:27.794 --> 20:30.027
and the beating of your heart
merge together.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.163
You and the mixer

20:32.165 --> 20:35.166
become one.

Junior isn't the only one
who's been tutored.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.321
Ironic, no?

20:57.323 --> 20:58.522
RON:
You know what?

20:58.524 --> 20:59.924
They belong together.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.827
Hah. In jail.

21:06.398 --> 21:08.099
So, do I pass or fail?

21:08.101 --> 21:10.167
SENIOR:
You both fail.

21:11.803 --> 21:15.273
Young lady, we will no longer
be in need of your services.

21:17.442 --> 21:20.378
Have it your way, Pops.
( <i>beeping</i> )

21:24.416 --> 21:26.484
I've already made
other arrangements.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.222
Mmm...

21:32.357 --> 21:33.958
You changed my life!

21:33.960 --> 21:35.326
I will never forget you!

SENIOR:
<i>And now, my son,</i>

21:37.497 --> 21:42.500
<i>we will return home and polish</i>
<i>our evil laughs together, huh?</i>

21:42.502 --> 21:45.169
<i>Oh, won't that be nice, huh?</i>

21:45.171 --> 21:47.805
Too bad about your restaurant.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.541
Yeah, well, when the health
inspector saw a live rodent,

21:50.543 --> 21:54.045
you know, <i>serving</i> the food...
the die was cast.

21:54.047 --> 21:55.913
Oh, oh, sorry.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.415
Bright side, I hear that,

21:57.417 --> 21:59.884
like, half the student body
wants to get into Home Ec now.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.986
And Photography is wide open,
you could jump ship.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.588
Nah. I think I'm going
to stick it out here.

22:07.292 --> 22:09.860
Hey... not too
shabby, K.P.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.562
I'm seeing major improvement.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.264
No big.

22:13.266 --> 22:15.866
I've got a great tutor.
