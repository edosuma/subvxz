WEBVTT

00:07.465 --> 00:09.259
I can't believe it arrived.

00:09.342 --> 00:14.889
-Me too. I'm so excited. What is it?
-Only an authentic piece of movie history

00:14.973 --> 00:17.767
I got from Hollywood Harold's estate sale
for nothing

00:17.851 --> 00:20.562
because I was the only one
who recognized the insignia.

00:20.645 --> 00:24.149
Having memorabilia like this
will attract so many customers.

00:24.232 --> 00:26.151
Great idea. What took so long?

00:26.234 --> 00:28.319
He tripped off the Space Needle
months ago.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.739
My Lucite guy has been pretty backed up

00:30.822 --> 00:35.702
ever since they decided to give every kid
in this generation a trophy. Am I right?

00:38.413 --> 00:39.664
Carlos, drumroll.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.291
-No chance.
-You have a Lucite guy?

00:41.374 --> 00:44.461
We deserve a trophy for letting you
work out your standup on us.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.179
It's a plate.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.014
Not just any plate. Right?

00:56.556 --> 00:58.099
-Please.
-Of course not.

00:58.183 --> 01:02.562
This is the plate Anthony Hopkins used
to serve Ray Liotta his own brains

01:02.645 --> 01:03.521
in <i>Hannibal.</i>

01:03.605 --> 01:06.941
-Shut up.
-How was he alive to eat his own brain?

01:07.025 --> 01:08.359
It's a commemorative plothole.

01:08.443 --> 01:12.947
-Well, well, well, look who's late.
-Did you lose car keys at bingo again?

01:14.365 --> 01:17.535
She lost track of time debating
if she needed a light jacket.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.414
Or had to cut her reading glasses
out of her hair again.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.209
Guys, it's not her fault.

01:24.292 --> 01:28.129
She had to drive back in time
to get minutes for her Jitterbug.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.383
Actually, I'm just back from a funeral.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.095
My best friend Helen died.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.766
Damn, Eliza. I bet you wish
you could drive back in time

01:39.849 --> 01:41.434
and not be such a jerk.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.979
I was joking. We were joking.
You guys said mean stuff too.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.397
Yours was terrible.

01:46.481 --> 01:47.982
You took it way too far.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.652
Can't believe I'll never see Helen again.
Or hug her.

01:50.735 --> 01:53.947
Or dish about our favorite telenovela,
<i>El Espia y La Tia.</i>

01:54.030 --> 01:55.490
<i>"The Spy and the Aunt"?</i>

01:55.573 --> 01:57.867
-It rhymes in Spanish.
-Right.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.496
Sorry. Did you wear
your Blockbuster uniform to the funeral?

02:01.579 --> 02:03.915
Of course not. I know better than that.

02:04.582 --> 02:05.875
I had a skirt on.

02:18.930 --> 02:23.226
I don't understand why he needs
an unabridged iTunes user agreement,

02:23.309 --> 02:28.606
Paula Deen's cookbook, or a transcription
of Ghislaine Maxwell's court case.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.150
Those are definitely my dad's.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.319
He likes to read court transcripts,
says the visuals are distracting.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.822
At least he's got tickets
to a self-help book reading.

02:35.905 --> 02:39.784
<i>-Only Up From Here.</i>
-Actually, it's <i>Only Up From Her.</i>

02:39.868 --> 02:41.202
Medea wrote a self-help book?

02:41.286 --> 02:44.622
No, it's about how to rebuild a marriage
after infidelity

02:44.706 --> 02:46.457
through the lens of the Clintons.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.001
I'm taking Aaron tomorrow night.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.546
Wow, good for you
for working on your marriage.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.923
And you seem really happy. Glowing.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.010
But just as a reminder,
this is a work printer.

02:57.093 --> 03:00.096
Is it?
'Cause you sure do let Percy use it a lot.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.974
I don't mind doing things
that help my best pal.

03:03.057 --> 03:05.768
He obviously only uses it
for important stuff.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.606
Last week, he printed his own
15-page bridge to "Uptown Funk."

03:09.689 --> 03:12.317
He's a surprisingly proficient lyricist,
but still.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.986
Doesn't it bother you
that Percy walks all over you?

03:15.069 --> 03:17.614
It probably would if he did,
but he doesn't.

03:17.697 --> 03:21.743
This is the man that made you break
in his Timberlands in the summer

03:21.826 --> 03:23.328
so they'd be fall-ready.

03:23.411 --> 03:28.541
They're Timbs, and you don't get me
and Percy's relationship. He's my--

03:28.625 --> 03:32.795
-If you say brother from another mother...
-No, I wasn't gonna say that.

03:34.589 --> 03:37.508
You just don't understand
how much he's done for me.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.595
I lived at his house
when my parents were divorcing.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.513
We're basically blood brothers,

03:42.597 --> 03:45.391
except Percy backed out
after I had cut my hand.

03:45.975 --> 03:50.396
You guys need to stop being uptight
and take a puff of this imaginary blunt.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.775
No? No? More for me.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.571
Hey, Slim Tim. Here for my pages.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.699
-Uh-oh.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.619
You know what it is.
Let me hit that right there.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.831
-Hey, we should hotbox in my car.
-Let's do it.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.251
-Little loose for me.
-No, it's perfect.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.378
-Really?
-Hey, pass it.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.295
Oh, sorry.

04:17.215 --> 04:19.259
Hey, Con.

04:19.342 --> 04:22.512
I just wanted to apologize
for my joke earlier.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.222
I didn't start that run,

04:24.305 --> 04:27.058
but I can't apologize
for everyone's actions.

04:27.141 --> 04:31.813
I can't stop thinking about everything
Helen, Yolanda and I used to do together.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.023
We were the three muchachas.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.817
Aw, that's so cute.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.946
We'd watch our stories,
cheerlead for the old men playing chess,

04:40.029 --> 04:44.075
and of course, collect
our favorite Intimate Angels figurines.

04:44.158 --> 04:46.744
Ew! Sorry. I meant:

04:46.828 --> 04:52.000
Ew! Sorry. I can't think of other words.
How did that toddler couple make a baby?

04:52.083 --> 04:52.917
I don't know.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.545
Maybe it's like
a Benjamin Button situation.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.381
But which way? Because either is a crime.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.592
-That's not the point.
-I can't decide which is more upsetting.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.178
That the toddler got pregnant,
which means they had sex,

05:04.262 --> 05:09.183
-or that the toddler is having periods.
-Eliza. Is that why you came over here?

05:09.267 --> 05:13.271
-To make fun of my cherished memories?
-I'm so sorry. Please go on.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.981
They're highly collectible.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.652
-This one was Helen's.
-At least you still have Yolanda.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.321
Yolanda lives in Long Lake.

05:21.404 --> 05:24.198
That's 45 minutes away,
a 20 pee-stop trip.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.993
I'll probably see Helen again
before I see her.

05:27.493 --> 05:31.080
Excuse me. Can you help me
find the film <i>The Da Vinci Code?</i>

05:31.164 --> 05:35.126
Could I interest you in a telenovela
about undercover aunts instead?

05:35.209 --> 05:36.919
It's not historical fiction

05:37.003 --> 05:39.505
but at least it's honest
about dying alone.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.841
Sorry. She's going through something.

05:41.924 --> 05:45.178
We do have <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>
and the sequel.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.471
<i>Angels & Demons?</i>

05:47.430 --> 05:50.641
Technically, that's a prequel
because that came before the book.

05:50.725 --> 05:51.601
It's over there.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.109
You know, maybe I could be
your soap-watching buddy.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.444
Really?

06:03.279 --> 06:04.113
Okay.

06:04.989 --> 06:08.034
Oh, you're gonna love <i>El Espia y La Tia.</i>

06:08.117 --> 06:10.370
-You only have to catch up on 20--
-Seasons?

06:10.453 --> 06:13.456
-Years. Three seasons per year.
-Sixty seasons?

06:13.539 --> 06:18.252
Wow! That is a lot of coolness.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.796
I'll go get my tapes.

06:19.879 --> 06:20.713
Okay.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.467
We've made peace with Timmy's
codependence thing for Percy,

06:24.550 --> 06:26.052
but it's creeping into work too.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.596
No offense, Kayla,
but he takes employee parking spots

06:28.679 --> 06:32.225
so he can use his for his Airbnb trailer.
He flat out steals our snacks.

06:32.308 --> 06:35.853
And any time I raise my voice,
he says, "Kitty's got claws."

06:35.937 --> 06:38.689
Yeah. My dad's got his bad side.
And his other bad side.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.984
Last month, he used so much of our ink,
we couldn't print out our paychecks.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.945
I couldn't get tickets to Mumford & Sons.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.322
Now I just have to hear
their songs in commercials.

06:46.406 --> 06:50.701
-I might side with Percy on that.
-I can't believe Timmy's oblivious to it.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.037
I'm gonna say something to him.

06:53.121 --> 06:56.666
I don't get paid to deal with Percy.
He describes me as "also gay for girls."

06:56.749 --> 06:59.836
-Yuck.
-Honestly, for my dad, that's progress.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.757
So they want you
to click wherever on the screen

07:04.841 --> 07:08.261
and hope for the best.
And that's how you play <i>Minesweeper.</i>

07:08.344 --> 07:11.305
Wow! That's crazy.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.350
Cool.
Again, that's not why I came in here.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.602
So you know how
I'm an accounting major, right?

07:16.686 --> 07:19.730
So it got me thinking,
when is the last time

07:19.814 --> 07:22.608
you did an accounting
of the relationships here?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.694
Is this about
Aaron and Eliza's relationship?

07:24.777 --> 07:25.611
Did they break up?

07:25.695 --> 07:28.865
Connie told me that Eliza told her
that he's not good enough for her.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.284
When you hear it from someone else,
it's more true

07:31.367 --> 07:34.328
-than when you hear it--
-No. This is not some gossip from Connie.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.247
Oh, well, doesn't matter.

07:36.330 --> 07:40.668
I shouldn't even care about Eliza
because I've moved on. I have.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.087
-I'm actually dating.
-Really? Who?

07:43.171 --> 07:47.133
Well, no one yet, but I am looking
to meet someone in the real world

07:47.216 --> 07:50.303
because you can't find
a "you complete me" on an app.

07:50.386 --> 07:53.931
Although, apparently, You Complete Me
is an app for people who are into Wordle.

07:54.015 --> 07:54.932
Sexually.

07:55.016 --> 08:00.062
Got it. What about
your relationship with, um...? Hmm.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.900
What about your relationship with Percy?
Anything there?

08:03.983 --> 08:07.236
Maybe your relationship
isn't as equal as it should be.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.531
Might be time to ask for respect,
set boundaries.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.409
-Like you did with your parents.
-You think?

08:13.493 --> 08:14.535
I don't know.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.205
Nah, we're good.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.833
Oh.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.001
What's that smell?

08:26.130 --> 08:27.423
Ew.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.842
Dude, are you reheating a litter box?

08:29.926 --> 08:31.719
It's my leftover tilapia parm.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.765
See, that's why I used your microwave.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.393
You might wanna air that out, dawg.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.230
Oh. Good call, P-train, will do.

08:43.856 --> 08:48.819
-Percy. What's that plate?
-The only serving dish y'all had in here.

08:48.903 --> 08:51.822
I found it
in your plate Hall of Fame thing.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.200
Anywho, I'll tap in later, dawg.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.409
Y'all be cool.

08:56.327 --> 09:00.373
-Mm! This is gonna be good.
-Well, I did try to warn you.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.707
That tears it.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.752
The plate tears it?
Not when he tried to evict you?

09:04.835 --> 09:07.171
Didn't he try to get Michigan
to believe you were dead?

09:07.255 --> 09:10.007
That bothered me too.
So did all that other stuff.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.594
But this time I'm gonna do something
about it just like I did with my parents.

09:13.678 --> 09:17.515
-Sorry, are you lightheaded?
-Oh, man. The smell is inside of us.

09:17.598 --> 09:21.102
So, Felipe the merman
slaps his sister Gabriella's son,

09:21.185 --> 09:22.728
forcing Gabriella to kill Felipe.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.064
But before Felipe is given a funeral,

09:25.147 --> 09:27.650
his hands are cut off
and donated to Mateo,

09:27.733 --> 09:31.737
a recently amputated D-level jazz pianist
in town for a gig

09:31.821 --> 09:34.156
-he cannot do without hands.
-Of course.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.534
Then Gabriella and her son,
who they Aunt Viv

09:36.617 --> 09:39.370
from a 12-year-old actor
to a 4-year-old between seasons,

09:39.453 --> 09:40.371
run into Mateo.

09:40.454 --> 09:46.210
His hands become possessed,
and bam, Gabriella's son is slapped again.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.841
But why is this Mateo
getting slapped in this scene?

09:51.924 --> 09:53.926
And he's his own uncle?

09:54.760 --> 09:58.180
What are you not following?
No way you got into Harvard.

09:58.806 --> 09:59.682
<i>You got this.</i>

09:59.765 --> 10:02.768
You are a semi-respectable adult
and deserve to be treated as such.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.688
-That's right. I am.
-Timbo Slice.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.608
-What's up?
-What's up?

10:08.691 --> 10:10.943
-What's up?
-Guess what day it is.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.654
-Guess what day it is.
-Guess what day it is.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.906
-Hump day!
-Hump day!

10:15.990 --> 10:17.575
It's fully Thursday.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.411
What are we gonna get into today?
Know what we should do?

10:20.494 --> 10:21.829
Make our own <i>Borat.</i>

10:21.912 --> 10:24.624
-Oh.
-Ooh!

10:24.707 --> 10:28.628
Um, actually, I can't, man.
Because I sort of need to--

10:28.711 --> 10:32.006
Of course you can't.
You never can hang out anymore.

10:32.089 --> 10:36.677
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You be working or whining about Eliza.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.430
Okay, this isn't about Eliza.

10:39.513 --> 10:42.558
This is about you
taking advantage of my business.

10:42.642 --> 10:47.772
Whoa, kitty's got claws.
Of course, I've intercepted a few boxes

10:47.855 --> 10:51.108
of Blockbuster hand soap,
but doesn't it balance out?

10:51.192 --> 10:53.944
It would take a hundred lifetimes
for it to balance out.

10:54.028 --> 10:57.698
Ever since we met trading <i>ALF</i> pogs,
you've treated me like crap.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.242
You remember back in high school
when you convinced me

11:00.326 --> 11:02.578
the word "chode" meant awesome guy?

11:02.662 --> 11:05.998
Then I met Rick Mahorn
and called him a chode so many times,

11:06.082 --> 11:09.085
he tore up my basketball card
and almost beat my ass.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.922
Because I knew your getaway speed
was faster than a power forward's.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.173
This ends now.

11:14.256 --> 11:17.176
Stop using my microwave,
stop using my printer,

11:17.259 --> 11:19.762
stop using my deodorant,
and stop using me.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.101
You know what?

11:26.394 --> 11:28.729
You're right. You're absolutely right.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.899
I'm gonna be a better friend.

11:32.858 --> 11:33.693
Really?

11:33.776 --> 11:36.612
Mm-hmm. I hear you loud and clear.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.655
Okay.

11:37.738 --> 11:38.906
Okay.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.492
Okay.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.493
Okay.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.248
-Uh, that went great.
-Yeah.

11:47.331 --> 11:50.751
-I mean, the truly best case. I'm stunned.
-Right?

11:50.835 --> 11:53.295
Did you feel like
you were watching Greta Thunberg?

11:53.379 --> 11:55.756
Wonder if any security cameras got that.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.469
Oh, I tried subbing in as Connie's friend.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.264
I'm at least 30 years too young
for the job.

12:03.347 --> 12:06.350
Thirty? Wait, you think the number's 30?

12:06.434 --> 12:07.977
Fine, 20.

12:08.060 --> 12:08.978
Leave me alone.

12:09.061 --> 12:14.442
Look, I need help convincing Connie
to hang out with her other friend Yolanda.

12:14.525 --> 12:18.070
Oh, that's not gonna happen.
She lives 45 whole minutes away.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.989
I know, but it has to.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.074
I cannot keep watching that soap.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.619
Even the YouTube recaps
are like three hours per season.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.414
Old folks
just get locked into their routines.

12:28.497 --> 12:32.293
-Connie reminds me of my dad.
-Let's try to get them to be friends.

12:32.376 --> 12:35.755
-They live ten minutes from each other.
-Dad doesn't drive anymore.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.214
What if Connie drives to him?

12:37.298 --> 12:41.010
That's a no go. He says men
and women can never be just friends.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.762
It's always sexual.

12:42.845 --> 12:47.266
That's dumb.
Look at me and Timmy. We're just friends.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.685
We are.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.688
Hannah,
your dad doesn't drive but still has sex?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.648
He lets women drive to him for sex.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.777
Oh! Yeah, at a certain age,
you wanna keep it close to home.

12:57.860 --> 13:01.071
-Wait. That gave me an idea.
-You're not my dad's type.

13:01.155 --> 13:06.535
You're very pretty.
Just not nearly as sturdy as he likes.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.371
Hey. Can I use your pisspot?

13:09.455 --> 13:12.750
Um-- Gross, but fine.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.335
Thanks.

13:15.252 --> 13:18.214
Hey. Can me
and my customers use your bathroom?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.759
Get your mind out of the gutter.
We're not going at the same time.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.260
I didn't think that--

13:24.136 --> 13:25.554
You can go after Carol.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.229
Hey, Con.

13:33.312 --> 13:37.024
What if I told you there were
other lonely women in your area

13:37.107 --> 13:38.484
and you could meet them

13:38.567 --> 13:42.321
without ever leaving
the comfort of your strip mall.

13:42.404 --> 13:45.241
Last time I tried,
I ended up handcuffed to a water heater.

13:45.324 --> 13:49.703
What? No. We just wanna help
find you a friend with similar interests.

13:49.787 --> 13:53.082
None of us can watch 20 years
of <i>El Espia y La Tia.</i>

13:53.165 --> 13:54.208
Or want to.

13:54.291 --> 13:57.294
Fine. My friend already died.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.048
What else do I have to lose?

14:03.050 --> 14:04.134
That's the spirit.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.266
So where do you see yourself
in five years?

14:10.349 --> 14:13.894
Retired to my cabin.
I take a little bit of poison every day.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.522
Not to hurt myself.
To make myself stronger.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.608
That's why she doesn't have any teeth.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.236
You on Facebook? I can send you some info.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.153
Ooh!

14:23.237 --> 14:26.657
Fair warning. She only posts selfies with
dead animals and Tucker Carlson memes.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.617
-Sure.
-It was nice to see you.

14:28.701 --> 14:32.079
Ooh! I'm always looking for new friends.
Excuse me a moment.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.420
I'm sorry. What was I saying?

14:39.503 --> 14:40.337
Run.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.259
Wow, it sounds like you and Connie
have so much in common.

14:45.342 --> 14:48.012
I guess so.
You'll have to come by my house

14:48.095 --> 14:51.181
so we can finish the new season
of <i>El Espia</i> together.

14:51.265 --> 14:55.227
-Oh, I'd love to. Where do you live?
-I'm only about an hour away.

14:55.311 --> 14:59.231
-Thank you for wasting everyone's time.
-There had to be a catch.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.066
Wow!

15:02.401 --> 15:04.904
Ah! Busy, busy, busy.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.406
Vision boards work, people.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.118
Hello. Can I help you pick a movie?

15:11.201 --> 15:14.163
-Perhaps something with Dick Van Dyke?
-I'm here because all the bathrooms

15:14.246 --> 15:16.582
-in the mall are closed.
-Is that right?

15:16.665 --> 15:20.544
Ooh! That's my dawg.

15:20.628 --> 15:24.423
I figured I'd swing by and say,
"You're welcome."

15:24.506 --> 15:26.091
Uh, for what?

15:26.175 --> 15:29.261
I shut down water in the shopping center
for plumbing upgrades,

15:29.345 --> 15:33.432
but I needed to leave one bathroom open
for folks to use.

15:33.515 --> 15:36.727
So I figured I should be
a better friend to my dawg, Tim,

15:36.810 --> 15:38.437
and leave his bathroom open.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.524
No, no. No cutting. No cutting. Thanks.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.696
Your mother was such a beautiful soul.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.324
Her figurine?

15:50.407 --> 15:53.953
Uh, was it gone before or after I left?

15:54.787 --> 15:56.455
Well, good luck. Bye.

15:57.331 --> 16:01.001
Hey. We're sorry
we couldn't find you a new friend.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.462
We really did
wanna come through for you.

16:03.545 --> 16:06.256
We had no idea
there were so many flavors of old weirdo.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.635
I'd say it's fine,
but you guys got my hopes up

16:09.718 --> 16:12.638
telling me
you could find the Gayle to my Oprah.

16:12.721 --> 16:15.599
But all you've been giving me
is Dr. Phils.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.059
I'm sorry.

16:17.142 --> 16:21.480
Maybe all we should've tried
to give you was a hug.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.317
Oh!

16:30.114 --> 16:31.323
Your hooves!

16:33.033 --> 16:34.952
-Guys, one side, please.
-Folks, one line.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.913
-The middle is not a side. Thank you.
-One line, thank you.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.542
I do not get it. How is anything
you did triggering to Percy?

16:41.625 --> 16:43.419
Everything is triggering to him.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.213
It's been that way our whole lives.
He's super sensitive.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.757
That's why I let stuff go,
because he always overreacts

16:48.841 --> 16:50.759
and it becomes a bigger pain to deal with.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.387
Sorry. Maybe you should've
let this one go. My bad. I--

16:53.470 --> 16:54.805
No, screw that.

16:54.888 --> 16:58.100
-He's the one who will be sorry.
-I think you've having a breakthrough.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.687
Unclear if it's a "through" or a "down,"
but either way I'm about to end this.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.397
Excuse me. Can I--?

17:03.480 --> 17:06.233
No, you cannot shit in my bathroom.

17:06.316 --> 17:09.820
This is my place,
and no one shits in my bathroom but me.

17:09.903 --> 17:13.657
I'm about to barrel down and take
the biggest shit you could imagine.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.411
Timmy, what have you done?

17:17.494 --> 17:19.371
Cool, man.

17:20.122 --> 17:24.001
I was actually gonna say,
"Can I introduce myself?"

17:24.084 --> 17:28.172
My mom owns the Hot Piece of Bass,
and I grew up loving Blockbuster,

17:28.255 --> 17:30.424
and I was excited
to see one still existed.

17:30.507 --> 17:33.177
Timmy Yoon, nice to meet you.
And you are?

17:34.053 --> 17:34.887
Leaving.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.977
I'm out of here.
I can only deuce where there's good vibes.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.611
Sure are a lot of colors
with "slut" in the name, huh?

17:50.694 --> 17:53.238
I'm so sorry.
We'll get this fixed for you.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.032
Patrice, we need nail glue.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.618
You have to be licensed to use it.

17:57.701 --> 17:59.328
It's an emergency, Patrice.

18:01.246 --> 18:07.002
There are only seven of these postpartum
toddler figurines in circulation.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.088
How did you know that?

18:10.130 --> 18:13.175
How could I not?
It was the last Intimate Angel

18:13.258 --> 18:16.595
sculpted by Victor Fenton
before he was ousted from the company.

18:16.678 --> 18:21.350
All these years, I didn't know
you were into Intimate Angels.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.352
The reason I am where I am today

18:23.435 --> 18:26.980
is because I know how
to separate business and pleasure.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.108
That's the title of my memoir.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.111
<i>Where I Am Today:</i>
<i>The Connie Serrano Story.</i>

18:32.820 --> 18:37.699
I always say memoirs are the light
in the tunnel of our collective soul.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.078
When do you clock out?

18:41.161 --> 18:41.995
Soon.

18:43.038 --> 18:43.872
Soon.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.335
Hi, Percy, I'm here to punch you.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.554
Hey. I just wanted to apologize for--

18:58.637 --> 19:00.597
Announcing today's stool schedule?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.224
Yes, that was weird.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.601
I'm in a weird space right now.

19:04.685 --> 19:08.856
I wonder if my manager will give me
a weird space day, like a sick day. JK.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.983
I don't have a manager
because I'm the owner.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.402
Maybe we could just start over.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.239
I'm Timmy, and I'm sorry.

19:18.991 --> 19:19.950
I'm Lena.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.912
And I'm new at this glamorous job,

19:23.996 --> 19:26.748
where I'm tasked with organizing
and hanging up fishing lures

19:26.832 --> 19:29.168
because my nephews
fell through my mom's skylight,

19:29.251 --> 19:31.461
and now I have to help her.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.463
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.381
Really?

19:35.174 --> 19:37.593
No, not that your nephews fell
on your mom

19:37.676 --> 19:39.344
because those twins sound horrible.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.724
Maybe they had a reason for falling.
People fall for a lot of reasons.

19:43.807 --> 19:44.892
Right? Like you.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.686
You fell from the sky as well
because you're an angel.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.396
Hello, I am new at talking.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.775
Um, I accept your apology.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.944
Well, it was very nice to meet you.

19:58.155 --> 20:01.700
I have to punch my landlord
slash ex-best friend in the face,

20:01.783 --> 20:04.369
but afterwards, you wanna grab a drink?

20:05.579 --> 20:06.747
That sounds nice.

20:06.830 --> 20:07.664
Cool.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.134
Percy.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.012
Percy, this ends now.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.598
Percy, what the hell is your problem?

20:24.681 --> 20:26.016
I miss you, okay?

20:28.936 --> 20:31.021
I miss you, man. That's my problem.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.649
-It is?
-Yeah, man.

20:33.732 --> 20:37.069
-I feel like you don't need me anymore.
-What are you talking about?

20:37.152 --> 20:40.822
You're either working, with Eliza,
or trying to get with Eliza.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.241
That's over now.

20:42.324 --> 20:46.453
Man, you're like this award-nominated
small business owner now.

20:46.536 --> 20:49.873
In my experience,
everybody tends to outgrow me.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.042
Just like my wife.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.796
My wife?

20:56.964 --> 20:58.507
Well, my ex-wife.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.802
Come on, man. I will never outgrow you.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.639
Sorry we haven't been chilling
as much lately,

21:05.722 --> 21:08.183
and sorry I came in a little hot earlier.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.186
I just learned the word "boundaries,"
thanks to my parents,

21:11.270 --> 21:13.772
and I'm figuring out how to apply them,

21:13.855 --> 21:16.733
especially with a man of your energy.

21:17.567 --> 21:22.823
What I should've explained to you better
is I gotta take my job more seriously now.

21:23.532 --> 21:27.536
The last Blockbuster on the planet
is literally on my shoulders.

21:27.619 --> 21:33.709
I get it, man. You know, trying to keep
a video store open in this age of 5G.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.295
Ooh! You got a lot on your plate.

21:36.837 --> 21:40.048
What you need is one of these right here.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.302
-Oh, man.
-Let me light that up for you.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.055
You know what I'm saying?

21:47.556 --> 21:48.473
Exactly.

21:48.974 --> 21:52.644
But without Joan Rivers,
there's nothing to watch on TV anymore.

21:52.728 --> 21:59.151
Well, there's this Mexican telenovela
that I love called <i>El Espia y La Tia,</i>

21:59.901 --> 22:02.487
but apparently, it's a big commitment.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.531
Well, how many seasons are there?

22:04.614 --> 22:06.950
Because I only invest in shows

22:07.034 --> 22:10.787
that have dedicated 20-plus years
into their world building.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.207
You're the <i>espia</i> to my <i>tia.</i>

22:15.125 --> 22:17.919
You'll get what that means in Season 5.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.504
Let me give you my number

22:19.588 --> 22:21.798
so we can talk about the show
after I watch.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.009
-Okay.
-Don't try to text it, though.

22:24.551 --> 22:27.137
-It's a landline.
-Oh, I would never text.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.972
Big voice message gal here.

22:34.102 --> 22:37.064
You're best friends
with the owner of a party store

22:37.147 --> 22:40.942
and highly protective of your toilet.
Maybe you can have it all.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.944
Wait until you see my ten speed.

22:43.820 --> 22:46.114
Connie and Patrice clicked right away.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.533
They are so cute, you have to see them.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.120
Two.

22:55.457 --> 22:58.668
Actually,
I don't think they're here, so...

22:58.752 --> 23:00.295
Isn't that them there?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.005
Oh. Ha!

23:02.089 --> 23:03.340
Yep, there they are.

23:03.423 --> 23:04.633
So cute, right?

23:04.716 --> 23:09.179
Um, I forgot that I, uh-- I have a thing.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.859
No, no.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.320
No, no, no.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.155
Percy.
