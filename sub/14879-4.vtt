all of five hours

offered up a trade.

No.

blew his cover.

- What?

in the country for five days

to the government."

Okay, look,
I understand your concern.

24:59.177 --> 25:01.779
Just give me a few hours.

25:01.847 --> 25:06.485
It's all going to work out.

25:06.552 --> 25:10.355
I guess,
if you think it'll work.

25:10.423 --> 25:12.123
Good.

25:13.759 --> 25:15.960
Good.

25:19.230 --> 25:22.799
Genaro fell for it.
He's dirty.

25:22.867 --> 25:24.868
We're being played.
I'm sure of it.

25:24.935 --> 25:26.402
Pleading,
"We're in this together"?

25:26.470 --> 25:27.838
Right.

25:27.905 --> 25:29.907
Actually,
there was a problem.

25:29.975 --> 25:32.176
Annie busted through
a police barricade.

25:32.244 --> 25:33.745
There's a countrywide A.P.B.
out on her.

25:33.813 --> 25:34.980
What do you want me to do?

25:35.048 --> 25:37.015
Change directives.

25:37.083 --> 25:39.786
Let's move on an extraction.

25:39.854 --> 25:44.591
[Engine sputtering]

25:44.659 --> 25:46.760
[Engine stalls,
air hissing]

25:46.828 --> 25:48.862
[Coughs]

25:50.331 --> 25:53.901
Take your clothes off.

25:53.969 --> 25:56.070
Uh, pardon me?

25:56.138 --> 25:58.339
There's no way that hitter
could have known where we were.

25:58.407 --> 25:59.407
Take 'em off.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.043
Um...

26:01.111 --> 26:02.444
For heaven sakes.

26:02.512 --> 26:03.778
I'll step outside.

26:03.846 --> 26:07.782
No, that--ah.

26:07.850 --> 26:10.752
When you were in custody,
did anyone come to visit you?

26:10.820 --> 26:12.421
Uh, yes.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.422
One person from the embassy.
So what?

26:14.490 --> 26:16.525
Who?

26:16.593 --> 26:18.327
He didn't say his name.

26:18.394 --> 26:20.528
Did anyone else have access

26:20.596 --> 26:25.133
to where you were
or your things?

26:25.201 --> 26:27.134
No.

26:28.771 --> 26:31.740
You didn't check
your clothes.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.909
No.
Why would I?

26:35.845 --> 26:38.046
That's how the hitter
found us.

26:38.114 --> 26:42.083
He must have planted it
on you when you met.

26:42.151 --> 26:45.153
Get dressed.
We're on foot from here.

26:45.221 --> 26:48.222
Are you kidding?

26:48.290 --> 26:50.257
"Get dressed. Take it off.

26:50.325 --> 26:54.028
Run. Come here.
Stop. Go there."

26:54.096 --> 26:55.630
[Sighs]

26:55.697 --> 26:58.433
[Speaking Italian]

27:02.071 --> 27:04.071
Again?

27:04.139 --> 27:05.239
It's for your own good.

27:05.307 --> 27:07.775
Yeah, sure.
Whatever.

27:07.843 --> 27:10.211
You know, I bet you never had
an Italian boyfriend.

27:10.278 --> 27:12.746
Oh, which would change
my life forever, no doubt.

27:12.814 --> 27:15.415
You joke, but you ask
any woman, she'll tell you.

27:15.483 --> 27:16.716
We know things.

27:16.784 --> 27:18.618
You, however--
you're a lost cause.

27:18.686 --> 27:20.353
- Are you really this person?
- Eh.

27:20.421 --> 27:22.154
I'm trying to keep us alive,

27:22.222 --> 27:23.622
and you're interested
in my boyfriends?

27:23.690 --> 27:25.157
Well, I'm trying
to help your love life--

27:25.225 --> 27:26.492
You want to help me?

27:26.559 --> 27:29.360
Tell me who's trying
to kill you.

27:29.428 --> 27:30.428
[Sighs]

27:30.496 --> 27:31.863
Well--

27:31.931 --> 27:33.298
Unless a woman
shouldn't know these things.

27:33.366 --> 27:34.866
Look, I mean--

27:34.934 --> 27:38.837
I think it's about a story
I've been working on...

27:38.905 --> 27:40.339
about the O.C.U.

27:40.406 --> 27:41.640
The Italian
oil conglomerate?

27:41.708 --> 27:43.275
Yes, exactly,
and the Italian government.

27:43.343 --> 27:44.777
It's a conspiracy?

27:44.845 --> 27:47.380
My sources are connected
to certain government officials.

27:47.448 --> 27:50.216
It's about the oil rigs
here in South America.

27:50.284 --> 27:52.252
I want to get you
to a safe house.

27:55.223 --> 27:59.661
[Crowd cheering]

27:59.728 --> 28:01.062
They say,
"Follow the money."

28:01.130 --> 28:05.600
Well, I followed the money,
and here I am.

28:05.668 --> 28:07.669
They know I'm close
to publishing.

28:07.737 --> 28:09.137
I have corroboration--

28:09.205 --> 28:10.805
how they bribed
and extorted

28:10.873 --> 28:12.773
to get their share
of the San Jorge oil fields.

28:12.841 --> 28:16.043
They want to stop me.
They need to stop me.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.145
I am not a spy.

28:18.212 --> 28:19.679
I'm a writer.

28:19.747 --> 28:21.581
I've been working
on this story for two years.

28:21.649 --> 28:23.917
Someone wants me
back in Italy to--

28:23.985 --> 28:26.820
to stop me from publishing.

28:26.888 --> 28:29.023
The Italian embassy
may not be the place to go.

28:29.091 --> 28:30.424
Finally.

28:30.492 --> 28:31.926
But we can't go
to the U.S. embassy either.

28:31.994 --> 28:33.328
- Why?
- It's complicated.

28:33.396 --> 28:35.997
[Cell phone rings]

28:36.065 --> 28:37.733
Yeah?
Where are you?

28:37.801 --> 28:39.435
- We're in the city.
- You are not safe.

28:39.502 --> 28:41.270
The local authorities
have your descriptions.

28:41.338 --> 28:42.572
Not surprising.

28:42.639 --> 28:44.340
We're working
on an extraction.

28:44.408 --> 28:46.375
You are not to go
to the Italian embassy.

28:46.443 --> 28:47.677
Understood?
Yeah.

28:47.745 --> 28:49.178
I-I already figured that out.

28:49.246 --> 28:51.013
Are either of you injured?

28:51.081 --> 28:52.549
No, we're good.

28:52.616 --> 28:55.451
The package may not be
what we thought it was.

28:55.519 --> 28:57.787
Well, I don't think anyone
is who we think they are.

28:57.855 --> 29:00.222
Either way, your safety
is what's important.

29:00.290 --> 29:01.824
Auggie's working
on a possible exit.

29:01.892 --> 29:03.493
"Possible"?

29:03.560 --> 29:05.995
Highly probable, though still
in the formative stages.

29:06.062 --> 29:07.396
I need you to get

29:07.464 --> 29:10.032
to the U.S. President's
Line terminal at the wharf.

29:10.100 --> 29:11.801
U.S. President's line

29:11.868 --> 29:13.402
at Buenos Aires
or La Cotta?

29:13.470 --> 29:15.304
Buenos Aires, berth 28.

29:15.372 --> 29:17.206
I'll have more information
when you get there.

29:17.273 --> 29:19.008
Just get there and be safe.

29:19.076 --> 29:21.277
And there's another detail
you need to be aware of.

29:21.345 --> 29:22.712
Annie, we've discovered

29:22.780 --> 29:24.313
that two of Carlo's contacts
have turned up dead

29:24.381 --> 29:25.648
in the past 24 hours.

29:25.716 --> 29:27.616
Both were employed by O.C.U.

29:27.684 --> 29:29.585
He told me he's working
on a story about O.C.U.

29:29.653 --> 29:32.621
Their names are Rinaldo
and Vasquez.

29:32.689 --> 29:34.723
Keep your head down.
Get to the wharf.

29:34.791 --> 29:37.526
We'll get you out.

29:37.593 --> 29:39.995
What?

29:40.062 --> 29:42.197
Rinaldo and Vasquez--
does that mean anything?

29:42.264 --> 29:44.199
Two of my sources.
Why?

29:44.266 --> 29:46.901
They're dead.

29:51.440 --> 29:52.707
We have to get to the wharf.

29:52.775 --> 29:54.609
My agency's gonna try
and get us out of here.

29:54.677 --> 29:57.545
But, but--

29:57.613 --> 29:59.580
Carlo.

29:59.648 --> 30:01.850
Carlo, I'm sorry.

30:01.917 --> 30:03.919
I know this is hard,
but we have to move.

30:03.987 --> 30:05.554
I'm responsible.

30:05.621 --> 30:07.456
They put their faith in me,
and now they're dead.

30:07.523 --> 30:09.191
The police
are looking for us.

30:09.258 --> 30:12.928
It'll all be for nothing if you
get caught and go to jail.

30:12.995 --> 30:15.497
We have to move, now.

30:17.834 --> 30:19.435
[Speaking spanish]

30:19.503 --> 30:21.170
Uh, oh...

30:41.692 --> 30:43.793
Sorry.

30:55.111 --> 30:57.946
[Crowd cheering]

31:21.637 --> 31:23.104
I need to talk
to the editor, please.

31:23.172 --> 31:25.507
<i>Claro que si.</i>

31:29.012 --> 31:30.680
Annie, how--
how did you know?

31:30.747 --> 31:32.348
Where else would
a writer go?

31:32.416 --> 31:33.716
A writer?

31:33.784 --> 31:35.551
Look, we are still
in danger,

31:35.619 --> 31:37.520
and I am still responsible
for you.

31:37.588 --> 31:40.056
- When did you decide that--
- We don't have time for this.

31:40.123 --> 31:41.524
We need to get
to the extraction point.

31:41.591 --> 31:44.359
I am glad. I really am,
but I have to do this.

31:44.427 --> 31:46.028
No, you need to trust me.

31:46.095 --> 31:48.996
I do trust you...
Mostly.

31:49.064 --> 31:51.232
But I trust this too.

31:51.300 --> 31:54.101
Look, if I'm going
to get killed, Annie,

31:54.169 --> 31:56.570
which at this point
is fairly probable,

31:56.638 --> 31:59.407
then I have
to get my story out.

31:59.475 --> 32:00.808
I have to.

32:00.876 --> 32:04.078
I made promises, and I want
to keep those promises.

32:07.316 --> 32:08.983
How do you know
they'll print it?

32:09.051 --> 32:11.553
I don't.

32:11.620 --> 32:14.288
But it's not
the battles won, Annie.

32:14.356 --> 32:15.556
It's the battles waged.

32:15.624 --> 32:18.659
You can understand that...

32:18.727 --> 32:21.395
If you are
who I think you are.

32:24.399 --> 32:26.667
Make it quick.

32:43.451 --> 32:46.554
You think I have
an ulterior motive?

32:46.622 --> 32:49.424
Frankly, yes.

32:49.492 --> 32:50.759
We all have motives.

32:50.827 --> 32:53.062
We're told that in our training,
to expect it.

32:53.129 --> 32:55.365
You think mine are suspect
due to my circumstances?

32:55.432 --> 32:58.468
No, sir.
Due to my circumstances.

32:58.536 --> 32:59.869
Uh-huh.

32:59.937 --> 33:01.571
You're
in a public relations battle,

33:01.639 --> 33:03.540
and I'm the feel-good hit
of the summer.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.008
[Chuckles]
That's ballsy, Auggie.

33:05.075 --> 33:06.443
Good for you.

33:06.510 --> 33:08.779
I have my reasons, sure.

33:08.847 --> 33:10.780
And, yes, I am fighting
for my career.

33:10.848 --> 33:13.417
So what?
It's irrelevant.

33:13.484 --> 33:16.086
There's never a clean
game board, Auggie, never.

33:16.153 --> 33:18.221
Gets more complicated
the higher you climb.

33:18.289 --> 33:20.524
Up or down, yes or no.

33:20.591 --> 33:22.459
Your decision, your terms.

33:22.527 --> 33:26.030
To hell with me
or what I may or may not need.

33:26.098 --> 33:29.233
And I wouldn't worry about me
too much if I were you.

33:29.300 --> 33:33.604
I still have a few teeth
in my head.

33:33.671 --> 33:35.739
Question--

33:35.807 --> 33:38.041
who would I answer to?

33:38.109 --> 33:40.176
The D.C.I. and me.

33:40.244 --> 33:43.479
And what about...Perks?

33:43.547 --> 33:45.881
What do you have in mind?

33:45.948 --> 33:48.550
Say I wanted an extraction
in a foreign country.

33:48.618 --> 33:50.251
[Laughs]

33:50.319 --> 33:54.288
I thought you were gonna ask
for a wet bar.

33:54.356 --> 33:56.691
[Carlo speaking spanish]

34:03.333 --> 34:05.601
His people are working
on the same story.

34:05.668 --> 34:07.436
He's got a reporter
in the San Jorge Gulf,

34:07.504 --> 34:08.938
and I also got a name.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.706
I know who visited me
when I was in custody.

34:10.775 --> 34:11.975
- Who?
- Genaro.

34:12.043 --> 34:14.511
Romano Genaro.
He's Italian intelligence.

34:14.579 --> 34:16.647
He gets a cut
on any oil extracted--

34:16.715 --> 34:18.282
potentially millions.

34:18.349 --> 34:21.018
I knew I was making someone
in the government unhappy,

34:21.085 --> 34:22.585
someone pulling strings.

34:22.654 --> 34:23.987
I didn't know until now.

34:24.056 --> 34:26.991
He's in for a big surprise.

34:43.577 --> 34:46.346
What's the best way
to the wharf?

34:50.051 --> 34:51.385
Genaro's our man.

34:51.452 --> 34:54.221
He's been assisting the Italian
oil conglomerate O.C.U.

34:54.289 --> 34:56.190
And coercing oil leases.

34:56.257 --> 34:58.692
Carlo Reni's investigations
were about to uncover that

34:58.760 --> 35:00.026
and name names.

35:00.094 --> 35:01.427
That's why Genaro
was so anxious

35:01.495 --> 35:02.896
to keep this off
the official channels.

35:02.963 --> 35:05.231
So much
for professional courtesy.

35:05.299 --> 35:06.766
Reni is not a spy.

35:06.834 --> 35:09.535
But, Joan, this doesn't change
the facts on the ground.

35:09.603 --> 35:11.004
Jorge--

35:11.072 --> 35:12.739
Your operative crashed
through a police checkpoint

35:12.806 --> 35:15.141

a local policeman.

we're in, Joan.

35:22.516 --> 35:24.450
You do your job.

35:24.518 --> 35:26.419
I'll do mine.

35:26.487 --> 35:29.422
Jorge, sometime,
somewhere...

35:29.490 --> 35:31.791
We will have future business.

35:31.859 --> 35:34.761
Do not think for a minute
that your harming

35:34.829 --> 35:37.097
one of my people
will not have a deep impact

35:37.164 --> 35:39.700
on our relationship.

36:17.874 --> 36:19.909
Annie,
what's he doing here?

36:19.976 --> 36:22.011
Someone at the newspaper
must have tipped him off.

36:22.079 --> 36:26.849
What?

36:26.916 --> 36:29.151
What?
I'm gonna uncuff you.

36:29.219 --> 36:32.288
Give me your word.
Yeah.

36:32.355 --> 36:34.089
I want you to stay right here,
and I'll be back.

36:34.157 --> 36:36.091
No, wait, wait, wait.
What are you going to do?
