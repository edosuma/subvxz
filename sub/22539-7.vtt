Once there was a man...</i>

00:11.094 --> 00:14.189
<i>...who went searching
for the true age of the Earth.</i>

00:17.893 --> 00:22.399
<i>In his struggles to discover it,
he stumbled on a grave threat.</i>

00:26.193 --> 00:31.040
<i>Beautiful spring day,
Pasadena, California, 1966.</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:33.792
<i>Business is booming, life's good.</i>

00:35.285 --> 00:37.253
<i>Except for one man...</i>

00:37.412 --> 00:41.417
<i>...a geochemist named Clair Patterson,
known as Pat.</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:47.723
<i>He knows that everyone he sees
is in danger from an invisible menace.</i>

00:52.803 --> 00:56.774
<i>And he's determined to put a stop to it,
no matter what the cost.</i>

02:39.660 --> 02:41.947
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> You can't really
tell Pat Patterson's</i>

02:41.959 --> 02:44.257
<i>story without going
all the way back...</i>

02:44.414 --> 02:48.965
<i>...to the time long before the Earth,
our home, was built...</i>

02:49.127 --> 02:52.677
<i>...when the stars brought
forth its substance.</i>

02:54.675 --> 02:58.555
<i>Iron for the planet's molten core.</i>

02:59.680 --> 03:04.607
<i>Oxygen for the rocks
and the water and the air.</i>

03:04.768 --> 03:09.569
<i>Carbon for diamonds and life.</i>

03:37.384 --> 03:41.480
<i>A star is born, ours.</i>

03:43.181 --> 03:45.809
<i>For the first few million years,
things ran smoothly...</i>

03:45.976 --> 03:50.482
<i>...as dust grains snowballed
into progressively larger objects.</i>

03:55.360 --> 03:59.786
<i>But once these objects grew massive enough
to have sufficient gravity...</i>

04:07.247 --> 04:11.093
<i>...they began pulling each other
into crossing orbits.</i>

04:18.257 --> 04:22.183
<i>This is how our world looked
when it was new.</i>

04:22.971 --> 04:25.850
<i>No part of the Earth's surface
could survive intact...</i>

04:26.016 --> 04:27.939
<i>...from that time to the present.</i>

04:32.481 --> 04:35.906
<i>So with all its birth
and early childhood records erased...</i>

04:36.067 --> 04:41.415
<i>...how could we ever hope to know, with
any certainty, the true age of our world?</i>

04:41.573 --> 04:45.669
<i>People have been wondering about this
since antiquity.</i>

04:47.871 --> 04:52.627
<i>In 1650, Archbishop James Ussher of Ireland
made a calculation...</i>

04:52.793 --> 04:55.171
<i>...that seemed to settle the question.</i>

04:55.337 --> 04:58.216
<i>Like almost everyone else
of his time and his world...</i>

04:58.381 --> 05:01.885
<i>...he accepted the biblical account
of creation as authoritative.</i>

05:02.052 --> 05:04.521
<i>But the Bible does not give exact years...</i>

05:04.679 --> 05:07.398
<i>...so, Ussher searched for an event
in the Old Testament...</i>

05:07.557 --> 05:10.151
<i>...that corresponded
to a known historical date.</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:13.564
<i>He found it in the Second Book of Kings...</i>

05:13.730 --> 05:18.577
<i>...the death of the Babylonian ruler
Nebuchadnezzar in 562 B.C.</i>

05:18.735 --> 05:22.740
<i>Ussher added up the generations
of the prophets and the patriarchs...</i>

05:22.906 --> 05:26.206
<i>...the 139 "begets" of the Old Testament...</i>

05:26.368 --> 05:29.918
<i>...between Adam
and the time of Nebuchadnezzar...</i>

05:30.080 --> 05:36.588
<i>...and discovered that the world began
on October 22 in the year 4004 B.C...</i>

05:36.753 --> 05:39.006
...at 6 p.m.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.095
It was a Saturday.

05:41.258 --> 05:45.263
Archbishop Ussher's chronology
was taken as gospel in the Western world...

05:45.428 --> 05:48.853
...until we turned to another book
to find the age of the Earth...

05:49.015 --> 05:51.985
...the one that was written
in the rocks themselves.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.862
Most of the rock layers
in the walls of the Grand Canyon...

05:55.021 --> 05:56.273
...are made of sediments...

05:56.439 --> 06:02.242
...deposited as fine grains in a time
when this part of the world was a sea.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.997
Over eons, the sediments
were compressed into rock...

06:11.162 --> 06:15.087
...under the weight of succeeding layers,
with the oldest ones at the bottom.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.760
Pick a layer, any layer.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.236
How about that one?

06:39.816 --> 06:43.161
Once upon a time,
there must have been shallow water here.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.333
<i>Back in the Precambrian period,
about a billion years ago...</i>

06:48.491 --> 06:50.994
<i>...there was only one kind of life.</i>

06:53.663 --> 06:55.290
<i>These blue-green bacteria...</i>

06:55.457 --> 06:58.427
<i>...were busy harvesting sunlight
and making oxygen.</i>

06:58.585 --> 07:00.462
<i>For them, it was just a waste product...</i>

07:00.629 --> 07:06.386
<i>...but for the animals who evolved later,
including us, it was the breath of life.</i>

07:09.888 --> 07:12.482
Okay, pick another layer.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.484
How about that one?

07:15.477 --> 07:17.946
<i>This layer is known
as the Bright Angel Shale.</i>

07:18.104 --> 07:22.200
<i>It formed about 530 million years ago.</i>

07:24.402 --> 07:27.531
<i>These tracks were left
260 million years ago.</i>

07:28.239 --> 07:30.162
<i>So you want to know the age of the Earth?</i>

07:30.325 --> 07:32.953
<i>Just figure out how long it took
to deposit each layer...</i>

07:33.119 --> 07:37.590
...and then instead of counting the
"begats," add up all the layers.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.217
Easy, right?

07:39.376 --> 07:40.969
Just one problem.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.879
We know from observing this process--

07:43.046 --> 07:46.175
Because it still happens today
in oceans and lakes around the world.

07:46.633 --> 07:50.103
<i>--That sediments can be laid down
at widely different rates.</i>

07:50.261 --> 07:55.313
<i>It usually happens very slowly,
say a foot of sediment per thousand years.</i>

07:55.475 --> 07:59.230
But when there's a rare catastrophic flood,
it can happen much faster...

07:59.396 --> 08:02.366
...as much as a foot in just a few days.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.831
Many geologists tried this method
to calculate the age of the Earth.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.592
They used the Grand Canyon and other
sedimentary sequences around the planet.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.803
<i>But their answers ranged too widely
to be of much use.</i>

08:23.962 --> 08:27.512
<i>Anywhere between 3 million years
and 15 billion.</i>

08:33.054 --> 08:35.022
There were other problems
with this method.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.606
Even the deepest layers of rock
are not the oldest things on Earth.

08:38.768 --> 08:42.864
Why? Because not even rocks
could survive the Earth's violent infancy.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.783
<i>In space, it's another story.</i>

09:06.087 --> 09:08.806
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> Are there any mementos

09:08.965 --> 09:12.469

09:16.056 --> 09:19.401
<i>...from the creation of our solar system

09:19.559 --> 09:22.984
<i>It lies between the orbits
of Jupiter and Mars.</i>

09:23.146 --> 09:29.074
<i>Here is the stuff of the newborn Earth,
adrift in cold storage...</i>

09:29.235 --> 09:31.829
<i>...unchanged ever since that time.</i>

09:32.489 --> 09:33.991
<i>A million or so years ago...</i>

09:34.157 --> 09:37.752
<i>...a large asteroid happened
to jostle a much smaller one...</i>

09:37.911 --> 09:40.664
<i>...sending it on a new trajectory...</i>

09:40.830 --> 09:45.927
<i>...a collision course that ended one night
some 50,000 years ago.</i>

10:09.692 --> 10:14.619
<i>It must have shattered the peace of the
Grand Canyon as it sailed overhead...</i>

10:20.078 --> 10:22.752
<i>...to blast out this crater...</i>

10:23.414 --> 10:27.635
<i>...in what would one day be known
as Arizona.</i>

10:37.720 --> 10:43.398
Fragments of the iron asteroid
that made this crater have survived intact.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.109
If we just knew how long ago
that iron was forged...

10:46.271 --> 10:49.400
...we'd know the age of the solar system,
including the Earth.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.944
But how could we know that?

10:52.110 --> 10:55.159
Pick a rock. Any rock.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.163
How about that one?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.834
<i>Some atoms in this rock
could be radioactive...</i>

11:03.997 --> 11:08.093
<i>...which means they spontaneously
disintegrate and become other elements.</i>

11:08.251 --> 11:11.630
<i>A uranium atom
first becomes a thorium atom.</i>

11:11.796 --> 11:15.016
<i>On average, it takes a few billion years.</i>

11:15.175 --> 11:16.893
<i>The thorium is much more unstable.</i>

11:17.051 --> 11:20.476
<i>In less than a month,
it turns into protactinium.</i>

11:20.638 --> 11:24.268
<i>A minute later, protactinium
becomes something else.</i>

11:24.434 --> 11:28.439
<i>The atom undergoes
ten more nuclear transmutations...</i>

11:28.605 --> 11:32.109
<i>...until it reaches the last stop
on the decay chain...</i>

11:32.275 --> 11:34.949
<i>...a stable atom of lead.</i>

11:36.738 --> 11:40.914
<i>And lead it will remain for eternity.</i>

11:43.411 --> 11:46.506
In the 20th century there was a huge effort
lasting decades...

11:46.664 --> 11:49.588
...to measure the time it takes
for each radioactive element...

11:49.751 --> 11:51.469
...to transmute into another element.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.973
<i>Physicists discovered that the atoms
of each unstable element decay...</i>

11:56.132 --> 11:57.475
<i>...at a constant rate.</i>

11:59.385 --> 12:02.389
<i>The nucleus of an atom
is a kind of sanctuary...</i>

12:02.555 --> 12:06.276
<i>...immune to the shocks and upheavals
of its environment.</i>

12:07.227 --> 12:09.229
<i>Hit it with a hammer.</i>

12:13.816 --> 12:15.818
<i>Boil it in oil.</i>

12:20.740 --> 12:22.663
<i>Vaporize it.</i>

12:24.118 --> 12:28.339
<i>The nuclear clock goes on ticking,
keeping an absolute standard of time...</i>

12:28.498 --> 12:31.843
<i>...that does not look
to the sun and the stars.</i>

12:32.001 --> 12:34.424
<i>What better way
to find the true age of the Earth...</i>

12:34.587 --> 12:36.931
<i>...than with the uranium atom?</i>

12:37.090 --> 12:40.811
<i>If you knew what fraction of the uranium
in a rock had turned into lead...</i>

12:40.969 --> 12:45.440
<i>...you could calculate how much time
had passed since the rock was formed.</i>

12:45.598 --> 12:47.020
<i>But there's a problem.</i>

12:47.183 --> 12:51.905
<i>The rocks in the Earth that were present
when it was formed are no more.</i>

12:52.063 --> 12:57.160
<i>They've all been crushed, melted, remade.</i>

12:57.819 --> 13:01.699
There is a way to calculate the amount of
lead that was present from the beginning.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.538
It's a gift from the heavens: meteorites.

13:06.286 --> 13:10.837
This one, a fragment of the one
that made this giant crater, was ideal.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.678
The amount of lead deep
inside this meteorite

13:13.690 --> 13:16.381
is exactly the same
as when Earth formed.

13:16.546 --> 13:19.299
<i>Since you know the constant rate
of uranium decay...</i>

13:19.465 --> 13:22.229
<i>...that should give you
the age of the meteorite,</i>

13:22.241 --> 13:25.017
<i>which was made at the
same time as the Earth.</i>

13:25.638 --> 13:29.484
All you had to do was measure
the amount of lead in meteorites.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.945
<i>Easy, right?</i>

13:38.401 --> 13:41.530
<i>A scientist named Harrison Brown,
at the University of Chicago...</i>

13:41.696 --> 13:44.996
...first understood this in 1947.

13:45.158 --> 13:49.959
He chose a young graduate student,
Clair Patterson, to do the work.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.259
<i>Patterson couldn't possibly know
how this assignment...</i>

13:55.418 --> 13:58.092
<i>...would alter the course of his life...</i>

13:58.254 --> 14:00.427
<i>...and ours.</i>

14:13.603 --> 14:18.951

turned out to be so much more.</i>

<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> Clair Patterson,
son of a letter carrier from Iowa...</i>

14:46.094 --> 14:49.815
...was rebellious by nature
and not very good in school.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.395
But he was a natural-born scientist.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.946
<i>A geologist named Harrison Brown
gave Patterson...</i>

14:57.105 --> 15:00.780
<i>...what seemed like
a straightforward scientific assignment.</i>

15:00.942 --> 15:03.661
First off, Pat--
You mind if I call you Pat?

15:05.238 --> 15:09.618
Now, I know you're no geologist. Probably
couldn't tell granite from feldspar.

15:09.784 --> 15:13.505
But I hear you really know your way
around a mass spectrometer, Pat.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.132
Good. You married, Pat?

15:16.290 --> 15:19.840
Yeah, Laurie. Yeah, she's a chemist too.

15:20.002 --> 15:23.006
We worked on the Manhattan Project
together at Oak Ridge.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.846
Good, okay, well,
first thing you need to know:

15:26.008 --> 15:28.682
There are these tiny
crystals called zircons.

15:28.845 --> 15:32.349
Real small, size of a pinhead,
tight as a drum, and tough.

15:32.515 --> 15:36.986
Nothing gets in or out of them,
and I'm talking for billions of years.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.772
We know how old these grains are...

15:38.938 --> 15:41.862
...because we've already dated the rocks
they came from.

15:42.024 --> 15:46.825
Each little zircon has only a few parts
per million of uranium inside...

15:46.988 --> 15:51.368
...and that uranium is decaying
to even tinier amounts of lead.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.900
You figure out how to
measure that lead, and

15:53.912 --> 15:56.290
you'll know how to do
it for a meteorite.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.499
You think you can do that, Pat?

15:58.666 --> 16:01.044
Yeah, yeah, I don't see why not.

16:01.210 --> 16:05.807
Good, because when you do, you'll be
the first man to know the age of the Earth.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.182
And you'll be famous.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.142
And you'll see, it'll be easy.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.103
Duck soup.

16:35.536 --> 16:39.382
While Patterson tried to measure the trace
amounts of lead in the zircon grains...

16:39.540 --> 16:41.759
...another grad student, George Tilton...

16:41.918 --> 16:44.922
...was measuring the amount of uranium
in the same grains.

16:45.630 --> 16:51.353
<i>All Patterson had to do was measure
the amount of lead with equal accuracy.</i>

16:51.511 --> 16:53.934
She's all yours, Pat.
Measured it six times.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.519
Same result: 3.2 parts per million.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.776
Yeah, nice going, George. Thanks.

17:03.606 --> 17:07.452
<font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
Tilton's results were always the same.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.396
But Patterson's results
on the lead content

17:10.409 --> 17:13.208
of the same grains were
wildly inconsistent.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.959
This made no sense.

by previous experiments with lead?</i>

17:33.302 --> 17:36.647
<i>Maybe it was the naturally high amounts
of lead in the environment...</i>

<i>...that were messing up his results.</i>

17:44.230 --> 17:49.532

not solved the problem.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.666
He would need to design his own lab
and build it from scratch.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.927
The opportunity arose
when Harrison Brown moved...

18:48.085 --> 18:51.225
...to the California
Institute of Technology

18:51.237 --> 18:54.388
in Pasadena and invited
Patterson to join him.

We can move through the interlock now.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.738
Patterson had now been
at it for six years...

19:14.904 --> 19:18.204
...doggedly tracking down
and eliminating the many sources of lead...

19:18.366 --> 19:20.915
...that were compromising his instruments.

19:21.077 --> 19:24.923
He had built the world's first
ultra-clean room.

19:25.081 --> 19:28.961
He was finally able to measure
how much lead was actually in the rock.

19:29.126 --> 19:32.096
One whose age had already
been established.

19:32.254 --> 19:38.057
Now at last Patterson was ready
to tackle the iron meteorite...

19:38.219 --> 19:43.020
...to find the true age of the Earth.

19:43.516 --> 19:48.397

23:30.284 --> 23:36.132
<i>...a son of the marriage of heaven
and Earth, the god of lead.</i>

23:38.751 --> 23:43.006
These columns are all that remain
of this oldest temple in the Roman Forum...

23:43.172 --> 23:47.177

2500 years ago.

23:47.343 --> 23:52.395
It also served as Rome's treasury
and its bureau of weights and measures.

23:54.725 --> 23:59.731
Tonight is Saturnalia, the wild December
holiday in Saturn's honor...

23:59.897 --> 24:02.525
...and everyday life
will be turned upside down.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.489
The masters will serve the slaves...

24:04.652 --> 24:08.953
...no wars or executions will be allowed,
and gifts will be exchanged.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.866
A couple of hundred years from now...

24:11.033 --> 24:14.378
...when the early church fathers
look for a way to attract more pagans...

24:14.536 --> 24:17.710
...they'll decide to turn Saturnalia
into Christmas...

24:17.873 --> 24:23.380
...making it the latest in a long line of
winter solstice holidays to be repurposed.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.726
<i>This towering statue of Saturn...</i>

24:32.888 --> 24:37.143
<i>...may have looked something like this
on the night of Saturnalia.</i>

24:38.018 --> 24:42.615
<i>In ancient Rome,
this god had another darker side.</i>

24:42.773 --> 24:47.654
<i>That other Saturn
is a cold and sullen, sluggish ghoul...</i>

24:47.820 --> 24:50.915
<i>...given to irrational bouts of rage.</i>

24:51.073 --> 24:54.828
<i>He committed an unspeakable act of violence
against his father...</i>

24:54.994 --> 24:57.873
<i>...and devoured his own children.</i>

24:58.080 --> 25:01.157
<i>Of all the planets visible
to the unaided eye</i>

25:01.169 --> 25:04.258
<i>of the ancients, Saturn
is the slowest...</i>

25:04.420 --> 25:09.426
<i>...which could explain why they named
the planet after the god of lead.</i>

25:10.551 --> 25:14.431
But there's no denying that the more
negative aspects of Saturn's personality...

25:14.596 --> 25:18.351
...reflect the age-old knowledge
of the symptoms of lead poisoning.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.311
Funny thing about the Romans.

25:20.477 --> 25:24.107
Even though they knew that contact with
lead inevitably poisoned people...

25:24.273 --> 25:26.412
...rendered them sterile
and drove them mad,

25:26.424 --> 25:28.574
what metal did they use
to make the pipes...

25:28.736 --> 25:31.615
...that carried the water
through their legendary aqueducts?

25:31.780 --> 25:33.157
I'll give you a hint.

25:33.323 --> 25:38.921
The word "plumbing" comes from
the Latin word for lead, "plumbum."

25:50.507 --> 25:54.057
What metal did they use
to line their famous baths?

25:54.219 --> 25:57.814
And how did they sweeten their wines
when they were too sour?

25:57.973 --> 26:01.477
What did they use to line
their vats and cooking pots?

26:01.643 --> 26:05.489
There are some historians who believe
that the widespread use of lead...

26:05.647 --> 26:09.242
...was a major cause in the decline
and fall of the Roman Empire.

26:09.693 --> 26:15.075
Why did they continue to use lead
long after they knew it was toxic?

26:16.408 --> 26:19.833
It was cheap, very malleable,
easy to work with.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.965
And the ones who were exposed to it
at its most lethal levels...

26:23.123 --> 26:27.674
...the miners and workers who processed
the lead, were considered expendable.

26:27.836 --> 26:31.591
Their lives didn't matter.
They were slaves.

26:31.757 --> 26:35.387
Most of the Earth's lead started off
at a safe distance from living things...

26:35.552 --> 26:37.054
...down below the surface.

26:37.221 --> 26:40.976
But about 8500 years ago,
humans began figuring out...

26:41.141 --> 26:44.020
...how to dig into the Earth
and extract metals from rock.

26:44.186 --> 26:48.407
By the time this villa was new,
just a couple thousand years ago...

26:48.565 --> 26:52.866
...the Romans were producing
80,000 tons of lead a year.

26:54.947 --> 26:58.201
<i>Why is lead so poisonous to us?</i>

26:58.659 --> 27:04.257
<i>Because when it gets into our bodies, lead
mimics other metals, like zinc and iron...</i>

27:04.414 --> 27:08.044
<i>...the ones our cells actually need
to grow and flourish.</i>

27:10.796 --> 27:16.053
<i>Enzymes in the cell are fooled by the
lead's masquerade, and they begin to dance.</i>

27:16.218 --> 27:19.295
<i>But it's a dance of death,
because the lead is an</i>

27:19.307 --> 27:22.396
<i>imposter that can't fulfill
the cell's vital needs.</i>

27:23.767 --> 27:29.820
<i>Lead also blocks neurotransmitters, the
communication network between the cells.</i>

27:31.608 --> 27:36.535
<i>It interferes with the molecular receptors
that are vital to memory and learning.</i>

27:36.697 --> 27:42.375
<i>This is especially damaging to children,
but lead poisoning spares no one.</i>

27:43.412 --> 27:45.414
<i>Starting at the turn of the 20th century...</i>

27:45.581 --> 27:49.757
<i>...the makers of leaded paint
hired the fledgling advertising industry...</i>

27:49.918 --> 27:53.639
<i>...to persuade the consumer
that lead was child-friendly.</i>

27:53.797 --> 27:57.267
<i><font color="#808080">MAN :</font> A little toy lead soldier
once to the Dutch Boy said:</i>

27:57.426 --> 28:00.179

<i>Why don't you give a party

<i>...the other happy members

28:06.393 --> 28:08.896

<i>...which gives a light much brighter

28:19.281 --> 28:22.160
<i>A pair or rubbers entered

28:22.326 --> 28:25.956
<i>They said, "We are protectors
who keep you dry and warm.</i>

28:26.121 --> 28:28.874
<i>You know, when we were molded,

<i>...when chemist Thomas Midgley and inventor

<i>as an anti-knock

28:51.313 --> 28:54.943
<i>They formed a new company
called the Ethyl Corporation.</i>

28:56.026 --> 29:01.123
<i>It had once been considered for use
as a poison gas by the U.S. War Department.</i>

29:01.281 --> 29:05.502
Unlike the lead in paint,
tetraethyl lead was fat-soluble.

29:05.661 --> 29:08.961
A half a cup of it on
your skin could kill you.

29:09.122 --> 29:13.172

<i>This was one of the first times

29:56.753 --> 30:00.303
<i>...to cloak a threat to public health

30:00.465 --> 30:05.062
<i>Robert Kehoe, a young doctor from
Cincinnati, was hired by GM.</i>

30:05.220 --> 30:10.772
<i>He raised scientific doubts in the
public mind about the dangers of lead.</i>

30:11.184 --> 30:15.064
<i>Lead was naturally occurring
in the environment, he said.</i>

30:15.230 --> 30:19.235
<i>Yes, there might be occupational hazards
for the people who worked with lead.</i>

30:19.401 --> 30:22.405
<i>But that could be best handled
by industry self-regulation.</i>

30:23.572 --> 30:27.918

that lead posed any threat to the consumer.</i>

30:28.994 --> 30:32.919

30:34.458 --> 30:39.464
<i>Until Clair Patterson went searching
for the age of the Earth.</i>

30:44.593 --> 30:47.016
Clair Patterson's research
on the age of the Earth...

30:47.179 --> 30:51.059
...had made him the world's leading expert
on measuring trace amounts of lead.

30:51.224 --> 30:53.653
And like everyone else
at the time, he assumed

30:53.665 --> 30:56.105
the prevalence of lead
occurred naturally.

30:59.775 --> 31:03.655

<i>On a grant from
the American Petroleum Institute...</i>

31:10.786 --> 31:15.417
<i>...he carefully measured the concentrations
of lead in deep and shallow seawater.</i>

31:15.957 --> 31:20.463
<i>Once again Patterson found
that his initial data made no sense.</i>

31:20.629 --> 31:24.634
<i>There were only minuscule concentrations
of lead in the deep ocean water.</i>

31:24.800 --> 31:27.053
<i>But in shallow waters and at the surface...</i>

31:27.219 --> 31:30.849
<i>...the concentrations of lead
were hundreds of times greater.</i>

31:31.014 --> 31:33.113
<i>In any ocean, it takes
a few hundred years</i>

31:33.125 --> 31:35.235
<i>for the shallow waters
to mix with the deep.</i>

31:35.811 --> 31:38.638

34:01.957 --> 34:03.550
...is virtually limitless.

34:05.502 --> 34:08.005
Lead is a neurotoxin.

34:08.170 --> 34:10.520
When you ship your
tetraethyl lead from the

34:10.532 --> 34:12.893
factory, before you add
it to the gasoline...

34:13.051 --> 34:16.396
...it's handled just like a chemical
weapon. There's a reason for that.

34:17.514 --> 34:21.393
Where do you suppose all that lead goes
after it leaves the tailpipe?

34:21.560 --> 34:25.235
Think about what it might be doing
to us and our kids.

34:26.273 --> 34:29.902
Dr. Kehoe has shown that
the level of lead in the environment...

34:30.068 --> 34:33.242
...is as natural as snow in December.

Here, let me just show you.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.750
Thanks for your time.

34:41.913 --> 34:46.668
You're just gonna keep on putting millions
of tons of poison into the air we breathe?

34:47.293 --> 34:52.016
If my research doesn't put you out
of business, some future scientist will.

34:52.172 --> 34:55.848
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> Patterson's funding from

34:56.011 --> 34:58.810
<i>In fact, they tried to get him fired.</i>

34:59.973 --> 35:05.446
But the U.S. government, the Army,
the Navy, the Atomic Energy Commission...

35:05.604 --> 35:08.858
...the Public Health Service
and the National Science Foundation...

35:09.024 --> 35:12.870

him from Greenland in

the far north to Antarctica
in the far south...

35:19.034 --> 35:22.709
...and to rivers, mountains and valleys
in between.

As with the oceans,
he found that the amount of lead...

36:21.429 --> 36:24.899
...was much lower in the snow
of a few hundred years before.

36:25.058 --> 36:30.030
No matter where he searched on Earth, no
matter how far he traveled back in time...

36:30.188 --> 36:32.816
...the results always told the same story.

36:32.982 --> 36:38.955
The naturally occurring levels in the air

<i>...persuaded the public
they had nothing to worry about.</i>

37:12.397 --> 37:19.326
<i>Everyone thought Patterson was a crank
until one man started to pay attention.</i>

37:26.035 --> 37:29.505
Patterson went public with his
discoveries about lead in a big way.

37:29.664 --> 37:32.793
He published his findings
in a major environmental health journal...

37:32.959 --> 37:35.303
...and sent copies
to various government leaders...

37:35.462 --> 37:38.636
...including one highly
influential senator.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.105
<i>Edmund Muskie of Maine...</i>

37:45.263 --> 37:49.609
<i>...was the chairman of the Senate
subcommittee on air and water pollution.</i>

37:50.477 --> 37:54.653
<i>In 1966, he held hearings
on the lead question.</i>

37:54.814 --> 37:57.784
<i>The first witness was Dr. Robert Kehoe...</i>

37:57.942 --> 38:01.822
<i>...longtime scientific advocate
for leaded gasoline.</i>

38:01.988 --> 38:06.710
Is it, uh, your conclusion that in 1937
to the present time...

38:06.868 --> 38:11.294
...there has been no increase in the amount
of lead taken in from the atmosphere...

38:11.456 --> 38:17.429
...by the average traffic policeman,
service-station attendant or motorist?

38:17.587 --> 38:19.555
There is not the slightest evidence...

38:19.714 --> 38:23.639
...that there has been a change in this
picture during this period of time.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.600
Not the slightest.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.435
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> The hearings were scheduled

38:28.598 --> 38:31.568
<i>...when their fiercest

38:31.726 --> 38:33.899
<i>...was off in Antarctica.</i>

38:34.062 --> 38:38.818
<i>But he unexpectedly appeared
on the fifth day of testimony.</i>

38:39.317 --> 38:44.574
Looks like there seems to be an increase
in the concentration of lead in people...

38:44.739 --> 38:48.744
...as a result of exposure to the
environment. Is that correct?

38:49.452 --> 38:50.544
That is correct.

38:51.079 --> 38:54.407
In identifying typical
lead levels, you use

38:54.419 --> 38:57.758
actual measurements you've
taken in the field?

38:58.169 --> 38:59.261
Yes.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.553
Are these observations different
from the ones...

39:02.715 --> 39:05.218
...we've been hearing about
from other witnesses?

39:05.635 --> 39:08.309
No, they're the same observations.

39:09.973 --> 39:12.675
You've testified that
there has been no change

39:12.687 --> 39:15.400
in natural lead levels,
is that correct?

39:15.562 --> 39:18.361
That is correct.
You're sure about that?

39:18.523 --> 39:19.740
Absolutely.

with Dr. Kehoe's numbers?

39:29.492 --> 39:30.618
No, no.

39:30.785 --> 39:35.086
You're saying that the, uh, same numbers
are leading to different conclusions?

39:35.498 --> 39:36.590
Yes.

You know, this is the
kind of thing we

You seem to be very sure
of your conclusions, Dr. Kehoe.

39:51.639 --> 39:56.486
It so happens that I have more experience
in this field than anyone else alive.

39:57.896 --> 40:03.403
At these levels, lead is a severe
chronic insult to the human body.

40:03.568 --> 40:08.950
There is no medical evidence that lead
has introduced a danger to public health.

40:09.115 --> 40:13.621
It's irresponsible to mine
millions of tons of toxic material...

40:13.786 --> 40:15.663
...and disperse it into the environment.

40:15.830 --> 40:18.834

we would have found it.
