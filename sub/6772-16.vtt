WEBVTT

00:05.224 --> 00:07.314
Rainbow Dash: Now, what have we learned?

00:07.314 --> 00:09.102
Fluttershy: Lots of control.
Rainbow Dash: Good.

00:09.102 --> 00:13.003
Fluttershy: Screaming and hollering.
Rainbow Dash: Yes, and most importantly?

00:13.003 --> 00:14.629
Fluttershy: Passion.
Rainbow Dash: Right!

00:14.629 --> 00:18.715
So now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one.

00:18.715 --> 00:20.619
Fluttershy: (inhales, speaks softly) Yay.

00:20.619 --> 00:25.403
Rainbow Dash: (groans) You're gonna cheer for me like THAT? Louder.

00:25.403 --> 00:26.192
Fluttershy: (same volume) Yay.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.492
Rainbow Dash: Louder!
Fluttershy: (same volume) Yay.

00:27.492 --> 00:29.211
Rainbow Dash: (screaming, voice echoing) LOUDER!

00:29.211 --> 00:32.740
Fluttershy: (inhales sharply, same volume) Yaaay.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.551
(Rainbow Dash groans and falls over)

00:34.551 --> 00:36.177
Fluttershy: ...Too loud?

00:37.616 --> 00:43.886
(theme song begins) My Little Pony, My Little Pony, ah, ah, ah, ah,

00:43.886 --> 00:48.065
(My Little Pony) Twilight: I used to wonder what friendship could be

00:48.065 --> 00:52.152
(My Little Pony) Until you all shared its magic with me

00:52.152 --> 00:54.288
Rainbow Dash: Big adventure
Pinkie Pie: Tons of fun

00:54.288 --> 00:56.564
Rarity: A beautiful heart
Applejack: Faithful and strong

00:56.564 --> 00:58.514
Fluttershy: Sharing kindness
Twilight: It's an easy feat

00:58.514 --> 01:00.929
All: And magic makes it all complete, yeah

01:00.929 --> 01:09.381
(My Little Pony) Do you know, you're all my very best friends

01:15.279 --> 01:16.812
Fluttershy: (softly) Yay.

01:16.812 --> 01:19.923
(Rainbow Dash inhales deeply, cloud produces springboard noise)

01:17.787 --> 01:20.120
(drum intro)

01:19.923 --> 01:22.524
(air whooshing loudly)

01:20.012 --> 01:34.097
(driving rock)

01:22.524 --> 01:25.867
Rainbow Dash: And now, phase 1 of my routine.

01:25.867 --> 01:29.490
(oscillating whooshes as Rainbow Dash passes between trees)

01:29.049 --> 01:30.697
Fluttershy: (softly) Wooo.

01:30.697 --> 01:33.158
Rainbow Dash: (whooshes past) Phase two.

01:33.158 --> 01:46.049
(whooshing

01:34.097 --> 01:46.063
(music intensity building)

01:46.487 --> 01:48.053
Fluttershy: (softly) Way to go.

01:48.437 --> 01:53.055
(rhythm guitar)

01:48.053 --> 01:52.094
Rainbow Dash: Here we go. Phase three: the Sonic Rainboom.

01:52.942 --> 01:56.052
(whooshing)

01:53.174 --> 01:56.015
(drum solo)

01:56.146 --> 02:09.020
(electric guitar building in tempo, pitch, and volume)

01:56.518 --> 02:00.065
(air screaming, increasing in pitch and volume)

02:00.651 --> 02:02.056
Rainbow Dash: Come on...!
(air screaming, increasing in pitch and volume)

02:02.555 --> 02:09.009
(air screaming, increasing in pitch and volume, Rainbow Dash grunting)

02:09.103 --> 02:10.073
Rainbow Dash: ...Uh-oh. (screams)

02:09.196 --> 02:10.002
(music ends abruptly)

02:12.586 --> 02:14.068
Twilight: (sighs with relief) Last one.

02:14.676 --> 02:18.030
Thank you SO much for helping me clean up all these books, guys.

02:18.298 --> 02:21.004
It was a CRAZY weekend of studying.

02:21.038 --> 02:23.004
(Rainbow Dash screaming, approaching whoosh of air)

02:23.035 --> 02:24.080
(crash, Rainbow Dash yelps)

02:24.008 --> 02:27.063
(ponies groan in turn)

02:27.632 --> 02:31.026
Fluttershy: Rainbow Dash! You rock! (same volume) Woohoo.

02:31.255 --> 02:33.030
(gasps) Did my cheering do that?

02:33.298 --> 02:39.094
Rainbow Dash: (grunts, chuckles) Sorry about that, ladies. That was a truly feeble performance.

02:39.939 --> 02:44.058
Fluttershy: Actually, it wasn't that bad. I particularly liked 
 it when you made the clouds spin.

02:44.583 --> 02:50.076
Rainbow Dash: Ugh. I'm not talking about MY performance, 
 I'm talking about YOURS! That feeble cheering!

02:50.076 --> 02:52.025
Twilight: What are you two arguing about?

02:52.246 --> 02:54.061
Fluttershy: Were we arguing? I'm sorry.

02:54.614 --> 03:00.019
Rainbow Dash: (groans) I wish YOU guys could come to Cloudsdale 
 to see me compete in the Best Young Flier Competition!

03:00.187 --> 03:01.021
Twilight: What's that?

03:01.209 --> 03:05.048
Pinkie Pie: It's where all the greatest pegasus fliers get 
 together and show off their different flying styles!

03:05.481 --> 03:09.096
Some are fast! (imitates car engine revving and Doppler effect)

03:09.962 --> 03:16.000
Some are graceful-whoa, whoa, whoa! (screams, crashes into ground)

03:16.000 --> 03:19.090
Applejack: Golly, I'd love t'see ya strut yer stuff in that competition.

03:19.901 --> 03:22.008
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, I wish you guys could be there.

03:22.083 --> 03:26.012
Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.

03:26.124 --> 03:30.079
Pinkie Pie: (crashing out of books, talking rapidly) OOH! I'd love to see 
 you make a Sonic Rainboom! It's like, the most coolest thing ever!

03:30.791 --> 03:34.092
Even though I've never actually seen it, but I 
 mean COME ON! It's a Sonic Rainboom!

03:34.924 --> 03:37.015
How NOT cool could it possibly NOT be?!

03:37.153 --> 03:39.020
Twilight: What's a "Sonic Rainboom?"

03:39.196 --> 03:41.019
Pinkie Pie: (condescending) You really need to get out more.

03:41.193 --> 03:47.060
The Sonic Rainboom is legendary! When a pegasus like Rainbow 
 Dash gets going so fast... (crashes into books) BOOM!

03:47.602 --> 03:50.053
A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!

03:50.528 --> 03:54.026
Applejack: And Rainbow Dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off!

03:54.261 --> 03:57.063
Rainbow Dash: (sheepishly) It was a long time ago. I was just a filly.

03:57.633 --> 04:00.000
Pinkie Pie: Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?

04:00.000 --> 04:06.008
Rainbow Dash: (false bravado) A-are you kidding? I'm the 
 greatest flier to ever come out of Cloudsdale!

04:06.085 --> 04:09.001
I could do Sonic Rainbooms in my sleep.

04:09.011 --> 04:12.091
Twilight: Wow. If you pull that off, you'll win the crown for sure!

04:12.912 --> 04:16.002
Rainbow Dash: The grand prize is an entire day with the Wonderbolts!

04:16.023 --> 04:21.077
(wistfully) A whole day of flying with my lifelong 
 heroes... (gushing) It'll be a dream come true!

04:21.781 --> 04:22.094
Fluttershy: (softly) Yay.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.073
Rainbow Dash: I'm gonna go rest up.

04:25.729 --> 04:28.042
Don't wanna overprepare myself, ya know... (weak chuckle)

04:28.423 --> 04:32.032
YOU, on the other hand, better keep practicing.

04:32.324 --> 04:36.036
I need a cheering section to match my SPECTACULAR performance.

04:38.129 --> 04:42.096
Fluttershy: She's practiced that move a hundred times, and 
 she's never even come CLOSE to doing it.

04:42.958 --> 04:45.056
I don't know if I can cheer loud enough to help her.

04:46.534 --> 04:51.074
Twilight: ...Well, guess we'd better get this cleaned up. Again.

04:51.736 --> 04:54.010
Rarity: Go on, go on!
(Twilight yelps)

04:54.104 --> 04:55.026
Twilight: "Go on," what?

04:55.265 --> 04:58.084
Rarity: Find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into Cloudsdale!

04:58.841 --> 05:01.016
Didn't you see how nervous she was?!

05:01.163 --> 05:03.048
Applejack: Nervous? Have you spit yer bit or somethin'?

05:03.485 --> 05:06.088
She was tootin' her own horn louder than 
 the brass section of a marchin' band.

05:06.875 --> 05:12.036
Rarity: Oh, puh-LEEZE. I've put on enough fashion shows 
 to recognize stage fright when I see it.

05:12.355 --> 05:15.070
We've got to find a way to be there for her. Now, go ON!

05:15.699 --> 05:16.095
(crash)

05:16.952 --> 05:20.053
Twilight: (groans) How am I supposed to find a flight spell in this mess?!

05:20.528 --> 05:22.057
Pinkie Pie: A flight spell? One sec.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.017
Page twenty-seven.

05:25.172 --> 05:26.066
Applejack: How'd you do that?

05:26.658 --> 05:29.063
Pinkie Pie: It landed on my face when 
 Rainbow Dash knocked me into the bookcase.

05:29.063 --> 05:34.027
Twilight: Here it is! A spell that will allow 
 earth ponies to fly for three days!

05:34.274 --> 05:39.080
Ooh...it looks really difficult. I'm not sure I can do it.

05:39.801 --> 05:42.068
Rarity: You've GOT to try.
Twilight: Okay...

05:42.068 --> 05:44.091
But who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject?

05:47.997 --> 05:51.081
Rarity: I will! For Rainbow Dash, I will go first.

05:51.806 --> 05:53.066
Twilight: (nervously) Here goes...

05:53.663 --> 05:55.085
(straining)

05:59.236 --> 06:00.095
(grunts)

06:02.905 --> 06:03.072
(grunts)

06:07.386 --> 06:09.099
(orb explodes, Twilight screams)

06:13.284 --> 06:14.021
(Applejack gasps)

06:14.213 --> 06:16.016
Twilight: (dazed) I think it worked!

06:18.016 --> 06:21.042
Rainbow Dash: You've got to learn to be ASSERTIVE, Fluttershy.

06:21.417 --> 06:23.069
Don't be afraid to speak up.

06:30.056 --> 06:33.058
Billy: Well, well, well. What do we have here?

06:33.578 --> 06:36.060
Hoops: It's our old friend, "Rainbow CRASH!"

06:36.597 --> 06:38.096
Billy: (derisively) Get kicked out of any flight schools lately?

06:38.965 --> 06:42.003
(Billy, Hoops, and Score laugh mockingly)
Rainbow Dash: (indignantly) I didn't get kicked out.

06:42.003 --> 06:44.040
Billy: Face it, Rainbow CRASH.

06:44.399 --> 06:48.045
Flight school had too many rules and not enough naptimes for you.

06:48.449 --> 06:52.006
Hoops: Hah, ask her about the "Sonic Rainboom."

06:52.061 --> 06:54.057
Billy: (dismissively) That's nothin' but an old mare's tale.

06:54.569 --> 06:57.012
You don't have the SKILLS to try somethin' like that.

06:57.123 --> 06:58.093
Fluttershy: (normal volume, slightly more assertive) Now, wait just a minute!

06:58.934 --> 07:03.002
(meekly) Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to be more assertive.

07:03.021 --> 07:06.009
(regains composure) Anyhow, she IS going to do a Sonic Rainboom!

07:06.086 --> 07:08.078
Billy: No, she's not, 'cuz there's no such thing!

07:08.078 --> 07:11.047
Fluttershy: Then show up at the Cloudasium and see for yourself!

07:11.473 --> 07:12.087
(meekly) ...If you're free.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.010
(male ponies laughing)
Hoops: (through laughter) Yeah, I'll be free.

07:15.096 --> 07:17.074
Billy: Oh, don't worry. We'll be there.

07:17.743 --> 07:20.006
Hoops: See you then, Rainbow Crash!

07:20.065 --> 07:23.018
Fluttershy: (oblivious) Did you see that? I was so assertive!

07:23.176 --> 07:27.091
Rainbow Dash: (melancholy sigh) Those guys are right. 
 I'll never be able to do it.

07:27.913 --> 07:33.095
Fluttershy: But Rainbow Dash, just because you've failed the 
 Sonic Rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice

07:33.095 --> 07:37.048
doesn't mean you won't be able to do 
 it in front of an entire stadium,

07:37.048 --> 07:41.024
full of impatient, super-critical sports-fan ponies.

07:41.241 --> 07:42.096
(Rainbow Dash screams)

07:42.959 --> 07:45.079
Rainbow Dash: (hysterical) What do I do?! Everypony's gonna see me FAIL!

07:45.792 --> 07:47.098
The Wonderbolts will NEVER let a loser like me join!

07:47.975 --> 07:51.032
Princess Celestia will probably BANISH me to the Everfree Forest!

07:51.319 --> 07:53.092
(histrionics) MY LIFE IS RU-INED!

07:53.919 --> 07:55.045
Fluttershy: (quizzically) Rare...?

07:55.452 --> 07:59.017
Rainbow Dash: "Rare?!" The Sonic Rainboom is WAY more than rare!

07:59.167 --> 08:00.079
Fluttershy: Rarity...?

08:03.904 --> 08:06.092
Rainbow Dash: Rarity?! Are you FLYING?!

08:06.992 --> 08:09.045
Rarity: I most certainly am!

08:09.453 --> 08:11.050
Aren't my wings smashing?!

08:11.497 --> 08:14.079
Twilight made them for me. I just ADORE them.

08:16.559 --> 08:17.086
Why so shocked?

08:17.859 --> 08:21.046
We couldn't leave our favorite flier without a BIG cheering section!

08:21.459 --> 08:23.011
Rainbow Dash: "We?"

08:27.333 --> 08:31.065
Rainbow Dash: I...I can't believe it!

08:31.652 --> 08:33.056
Fluttershy: It's incredible!

08:33.556 --> 08:36.030
Rainbow Dash: This is so cool! You guys made it!

08:36.296 --> 08:37.052
Pinkie Pie: Sure did!

08:37.515 --> 08:38.048
Rainbow Dash: WAIT!

08:41.822 --> 08:46.000
How'd you do that? Only pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.

08:46.002 --> 08:47.095
Pinkie Pie: (giggles) Pretty cool, huh?

08:47.952 --> 08:52.046
Twilight: I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but 
 it was too difficult to do more than once.

08:52.457 --> 08:55.099
So I found an easier spell that lets 
 the rest of us walk on clouds.

08:55.986 --> 08:58.040
Applejack: And we came t'cheer you to victory!

08:58.401 --> 09:04.002
Rainbow Dash: To be honest, I was starting to 
 get just a teeniest, tiniest bit nervous.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.071
But I feel a LOT better now that you guys are here.

09:06.714 --> 09:09.076
Hey, we've got some time before the competition.

09:09.756 --> 09:12.024
Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?

09:12.024 --> 09:15.026
(all voicing agreement)

09:15.259 --> 09:19.067
Rainbow Dash: Here it is! The greatest city in the sky!

09:19.671 --> 09:23.052
(ponies "ooh" and "aah")

09:23.525 --> 09:28.008
Rarity: Oooh! Aaah!

09:28.076 --> 09:30.052
Rainbow Dash: Uh...

09:30.521 --> 09:34.072
Some of the greatest pegasi in history came from Cloudsdale.

09:34.717 --> 09:36.039
Rarity: Oh! Wait for me!

09:37.759 --> 09:39.052
(jackhammer pounding)

09:39.524 --> 09:41.066
Worker: Those wings are GORGEOUS!

09:41.066 --> 09:43.075
Rarity: (flattered) Why, thank you!

09:44.911 --> 09:46.098
Twilight: (admonishing) Be careful with those wings, Rarity.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.097
They're made from gossamer and morning dew,

09:48.974 --> 09:51.011
and they're incredibly delicate.

09:51.011 --> 09:52.074
Rarity: (preening) Don't worry, Twilight.

09:52.736 --> 09:55.099
I'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention.

09:55.987 --> 09:59.076
Applejack: Since we're up here, I'd sure like t'get 
 a look at where the weather's made.

09:59.761 --> 10:04.035
Rainbow Dash: Great idea! Come on, girls! To the weather factory!

10:04.346 --> 10:08.015
(peals of thunder)

10:09.454 --> 10:11.050
Rainbow Dash: This is where they make the snowflakes.

10:11.498 --> 10:16.005
Each one is hoofmade. As you can see, it's a delicate operation.

10:16.049 --> 10:19.088
Rarity: (gasps) Ooh, the snowflakes look even better from up here.

10:19.088 --> 10:23.087
(wings flapping, wind blowing lightly)

10:25.035 --> 10:30.031
(workers yelling frantically)

10:30.306 --> 10:33.056
Rainbow Dash: We'd better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought.

10:36.134 --> 10:39.001
Rainbow Dash: And here's where we make the rainbows!

10:41.892 --> 10:43.019
(Pinkie Pie licks hoof)

10:43.266 --> 10:47.030
(cacophony of random noises, Pinkie Pie pants)

10:47.303 --> 10:49.058
Pinkie Pie: (strained) Spicyyyyyy!

10:49.578 --> 10:52.088
(Applejack guffawing)
Rainbow Dash: Yeah. Rainbows aren't really known for their flavor.

10:52.875 --> 10:54.022
Hoops: Whoa!

10:54.222 --> 10:57.033
(Rarity's wings flap)
Billy: Whoa, where'd you get those amazing wings?

10:57.334 --> 10:58.045
I want a pair!

10:58.448 --> 11:01.033
Rarity: Hmm...yeah, I guess I could see that.

11:01.328 --> 11:05.004
Billy: Oh, hey, look! It's Rainbow Crash again!

11:05.043 --> 11:10.057
Hoops: (laughs) Yeah! Rainbow...um... (stumbles over words) ...CRASH!

11:10.569 --> 11:14.042
Rainbow Dash: Rarity?! What are you doing talking to THESE guys?

11:14.424 --> 11:17.058
Rarity: Oh, they were just admiring my wings, Rainbow Dash.

11:17.581 --> 11:22.050
Billy: Yeah, you should forget the Sonic Rainboom and 
 just get yourself some wings like THESE!

11:22.504 --> 11:25.024
(Billy, Hoops, and Score laugh derisively)

11:25.244 --> 11:27.089
(Rainbow Dash moans dejectedly)
Fluttershy: Uhh...c'mon, girls.

11:27.891 --> 11:29.060
Why don't we go see how clouds are made?

11:29.605 --> 11:34.021
Don't listen to them. You're gonna win that competition for sure.

11:34.207 --> 11:38.011
Rainbow Dash: Are you kidding? I can't DO the Sonic Rainboom,

11:38.108 --> 11:41.082
and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings.

11:41.823 --> 11:44.010
I'm doomed!

11:45.678 --> 11:49.058
(machines puffing clouds)

11:49.579 --> 11:52.018
(water pours, machine builds up pressure and vents)

11:52.179 --> 11:55.076
(workers chattering at Rarity, Rarity giggling at flattery)

11:55.755 --> 11:58.073
Rarity: (ostentatiously) Why, these old things?

11:58.727 --> 12:02.054
Go ahead, everypony. Photos ARE encouraged.

12:04.997 --> 12:08.071
Twilight: Rarity, we're supposed to be helping Rainbow Dash relax, remember?

12:08.712 --> 12:11.018
Put your wings away and stop showing off.

12:11.177 --> 12:14.084
Rarity: (dismissively) Oh, pfft. How can you ask me to put away perfection?

12:14.842 --> 12:19.014
(ponies "ooh" and "aah"

12:19.138 --> 12:21.055
(very ostentatious, self-satisfied laugh)

12:21.552 --> 12:25.087
Twilight: (worried) Rainbow Dash, are you okay? You don't look so good.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.029
Rainbow Dash: (panting, feigning confidence) Of course! Why wouldn't I be okay?

12:28.286 --> 12:34.065
Everyone's so in love with Rarity's wings that they won't even notice 
 when I totally BLOW IT in the Best Young Flier's Competition.

12:34.649 --> 12:38.060
Bubble Gabble: Hey! There's an idea! YOU should enter the competition!

12:38.596 --> 12:42.022
Old lady pony: Yeah, I could watch you fly all day long!

12:42.218 --> 12:46.044
Rarity: (haughtily) There really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like ME.

12:46.444 --> 12:48.058
Perhaps I SHOULD compete.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.056
Rainbow Dash: WHAT?!

12:49.556 --> 12:54.064
(workers follow Rarity and continue to "ooh" and "aah")

12:56.243 --> 13:00.098
Rainbow Dash: (anxious) What am I gonna do? I'll NEVER win the competition now...

13:04.091 --> 13:10.016
(ponies cheering, fanfare plays)

13:10.157 --> 13:12.075
(ponies cheering)

13:12.752 --> 13:17.040
(contestants chattering)

13:17.396 --> 13:18.051
(knocks on door)

13:18.511 --> 13:21.002
Rarity: (singsong) I'm going to be a while. (harp flourish)

13:21.019 --> 13:22.009
(door slams)

13:24.827 --> 13:28.082
(Pinkie Pie laughing giddily; Billy, Hoops, and Score laughing derisively)

13:28.821 --> 13:30.003
(anxious groan)

13:30.028 --> 13:32.035
Announcer: Fillies and gentlecolts!

13:32.035 --> 13:37.097
Please rise and join me in welcoming our beloved Princess Celestia!

13:37.969 --> 13:43.091
(crowd cheering wildly, fanfare plays)

13:43.914 --> 13:48.046

(fireworks explosion)

13:56.336 --> 14:02.056
(crowd cheers)

14:03.209 --> 14:10.032
And now, let's find out who will take the

14:10.315 --> 14:13.047
Backstage Manager: (nasal New York accent) Okay, contestant number one, you're up.

14:14.912 --> 14:16.026
(Rainbow Dash yelps)

14:17.838 --> 14:19.088
Manager: Okay, number two, let's go.

14:19.881 --> 14:21.037
Rainbow Dash: (nervously) Um...

14:21.367 --> 14:23.064
Manager: Come on, come on, we ain't got all day.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.036
Rainbow Dash: Psst, she's talkin' to you!

14:27.358 --> 14:30.038
Young male pony: Oh! Uh...I guess that's me!

14:35.346 --> 14:38.092
Manager: Okay numbah four, time to go!

14:38.922 --> 14:42.087
Rarity: (sweetly) I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute.

14:42.869 --> 14:45.013
Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?

14:45.126 --> 14:49.002
Manager: (exasperated) Look, I don't care who it is, but SOMEPONY'S gotta go on.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.060
Male pony: (macho) LET'S DO THIS!

14:51.716 --> 14:53.067
Rainbow Dash: What am I gonna do?!

14:56.406 --> 15:02.007
Twilight: I loved number seven! Doing fifteen barrel 
 rolls in a row can't be easy.

15:02.072 --> 15:06.007
Fluttershy: My favorite is number ten. She just looked like such a nice pony.

15:06.066 --> 15:08.099
Applejack: Hmm.. Wonder how come we haven't seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet?

15:08.992 --> 15:10.057
The competition's almost over.

15:13.125 --> 15:16.000
Manager: Numbah fifteen, let's go!

15:19.051 --> 15:22.011
Rarity: (theatrically) Rarity...is ready.

15:22.111 --> 15:26.015
Manager: Look, ladies. I dunno what to tell you. 
 There's only time for one more performance.

15:26.151 --> 15:29.017
If you both wanna compete, you'll just have ta go out there togetha.

15:29.173 --> 15:31.072
Rarity: Well, Rainbow Dash? Shall we?

15:31.724 --> 15:33.063
(Rainbow Dash babbles incoherently)

15:33.628 --> 15:39.006
Announcer: And now, for our final competitor of the day, contestant number fifteen!

15:39.061 --> 15:41.071
(confused) And, apparently, contestant number four.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.024
(crowd cheering)

15:44.239 --> 15:46.098
Rarity: (bemused) Good luck, Rainbow Dash. Just do your best.

15:46.979 --> 15:50.056
(Rainbow Dash mumbles incoherently)
I hope you don't mind, but 
 I took the liberty of changing our music.

15:50.555 --> 15:53.094
That "rock and roll" doesn't really match my wings.

15:53.945 --> 15:54.090
(Rainbow Dash gulps)

15:55.496 --> 16:01.084
(elegant musical introduction plays)

16:01.084 --> 16:36.055
(gentle, elegant waltz)

16:02.049 --> 16:04.018
Rainbow Dash: (self-encouragement) Come on, Rainbow Dash. You can do this.

16:04.185 --> 16:06.018
Just remember the routine.

16:06.182 --> 16:07.072
Phase one.

16:15.424 --> 16:17.014
(ponies cheering)

16:20.486 --> 16:21.018
(thud, Rainbow Dash grunts)

16:21.182 --> 16:22.034
(Rainbow Dash screams, crashes into wall)

16:23.504 --> 16:28.075
Hoops: Nice work, Rainbow Crash!
(Billy, Hoops, and Score laugh)

16:33.814 --> 16:35.095
Rainbow Dash: Time for phase two.

16:36.554 --> 16:55.001
(waltz builds in intensity)

16:42.359 --> 16:47.000
Fluttershy: Look! Phase two is working!
(ponies cheer)

16:46.957 --> 16:49.003

16:52.785 --> 16:53.009
(Celestia gasps)

16:53.946 --> 16:55.002
(loud thud)

16:55.126 --> 17:21.000
(interlude)

16:58.218 --> 17:00.009
Rarity: And now, for my grand finale!

17:00.865 --> 17:07.000
I will fly right up to the sun and beam 
 my beautiful wings over the whole city of Cloudsdale!

17:07.041 --> 17:09.005
(squeals) They'll be talking about it for YEARS!

17:09.502 --> 17:14.001
Rainbow Dash: Looks like this is my last chance to turn things around.

17:14.101 --> 17:18.002
Phase three: (voice cracking) the Sonic (gulps) Rainboom.

17:18.327 --> 17:21.002
Wings, don't fail me now!

17:20.973 --> 17:32.001
(waltz increases in tempo and intensity)

17:23.906 --> 17:25.003
(crowd gasps)

17:31.701 --> 17:37.008
Rarity: (panting, theatrical) Look upon me, Equestria, for I! AM! RARITY!

17:32.073 --> 17:40.008
(crescendo)

17:40.571 --> 17:42.003
(crowd "oohs")

17:40.804 --> 17:43.001
(waltz ends)

17:43.079 --> 17:45.002
(wings burn up)

17:45.231 --> 17:48.000
Rarity: Uh-oh.

17:47.955 --> 17:52.004
(Rarity screams)
Twilight: Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!

17:52.414 --> 17:54.004
(Rarity screams)

17:54.364 --> 17:56.004
(crowd gasps)

17:56.407 --> 17:57.007
(Wonderbolts whoosh past)

17:57.708 --> 17:59.006
(Rarity screaming)

17:59.612 --> 18:00.004
(Wonderbolt grunts)

18:00.355 --> 18:01.009
(other Wonderbolts grunt)

18:06.346 --> 18:09.004
Rainbow Dash: Hold on, Rarity! I'm comin'!

18:09.434 --> 18:25.000
(suspenseful rock)

18:11.454 --> 18:14.007
(Rarity screaming and flailing)
Fluttershy: Oh, I can't look...

18:14.705 --> 18:16.002
(Rainbow Dash straining, air whooshing loudly)

18:16.237 --> 18:18.000
(air whistling)

18:17.956 --> 18:20.000
(Rarity, Pinkie Pie, Applejack, and Twilight gasp)

18:19.097 --> 18:25.004
(air whistling, pitch ascending)

18:25.038 --> 18:27.008
(tempo increases)

18:25.386 --> 18:27.006

Fluttershy: A SONIC RAINBOOM! WOOO! YEAH!

19:04.303 --> 19:07.002
Rainbow Dash: I did it. I did it!

19:07.182 --> 19:12.007
Rarity: You sure did. Oh, thank you Rainbow Dash. You saved my life!

19:12.708 --> 19:17.006
Rainbow Dash: Oh yeah, I did that too. Ha! BEST DAY EVER!

19:17.631 --> 19:21.002
(crowd cheers)

19:21.016 --> 19:28.005
Rarity: I want to apologize to all of you for getting 
 so carried away with my... (voice breaks) beautiful wings.

19:28.451 --> 19:30.002
I guess I just lost my head.

19:30.216 --> 19:32.007
Fluttershy: It's okay.
Applejack: Don't worry about it, kiddo.
Pinkie Pie: We still love you.

19:32.677 --> 19:39.003
Rarity: And I'm especially sorry that I was so thoughtless as to jump into the 
 contest at the last minute after you had worked so hard to win it.

19:39.318 --> 19:41.008
Can you ever, EVER forgive me?

19:41.078 --> 19:45.000
Rainbow Dash: Aw, it's okay. Everything turned out all right, right?

19:45.003 --> 19:47.009
I just wish I could've met the Wonderbolts when they were awake.

19:49.535 --> 19:50.005
(Rainbow Dash gasps)

19:50.464 --> 19:52.009
(rapid, fangirlish) Ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh!

19:52.879 --> 19:55.003
Spitfire: So, you're the little pony that saved our lives.

19:55.034 --> 19:58.001
We really wanted to meet you and say thanks.

19:58.126 --> 20:00.005

20:08.157 --> 20:12.002
Rarity: (remorseful) Princess Celestia, I am sorry I ruined the competition!

20:12.198 --> 20:15.007
Rainbow Dash really is the best flier in Equestria.

20:15.704 --> 20:17.009
Celestia: I know she is, my dear.

20:17.863 --> 20:23.003
That's why, for her incredible act of bravery and her spectacular Sonic Rainboom,

I'm presenting the grand prize for best young flier 
 to this year's winner, Ms. Rainbow Dash!

20:29.659 --> 20:35.003
(crowd cheers)
(Rainbow Dash repeating "ohmygosh")

20:35.116 --> 20:39.005
Celestia: So, Twilight Sparkle, did you learn anything about friendship from this experience?

20:39.528 --> 20:43.008
Twilight: I did, Princess, but I think Rarity learned even more than me.

20:43.847 --> 20:50.008
Rarity: I certainly did. I learned how important it is to keep 
 your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends.

20:50.813 --> 20:53.009
Celestia: Excellent. Well done, Rarity.

20:54.528 --> 20:57.009

Rainbow Dash: Aw, that's okay. Don't worry about it.

21:16.563 --> 21:21.002
Billy: Hey. Do you want to hang out with us? Maybe 
 you could show us how you did that incredible trick!

21:21.207 --> 21:26.001
