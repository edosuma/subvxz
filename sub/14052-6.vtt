WEBVTT

00:11.080 --> 00:13.880
JACK: Watch your step. Bit tricky along here.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.160
The nesting site's not far now.

00:27.440 --> 00:31.400
We overnight ahead, and push on first thing.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.960
ALEC: Yeah, and I was lucky enough

00:34.000 --> 00:36.960
to get to Cyprus, finally.

00:38.520 --> 00:41.520
Yeah, I did Cyprus. It was okay.

00:41.560 --> 00:47.160
I got a red-backed shrike and a Bonelli's Eagle

00:41.560 --> 00:47.160
on the first day. Boom.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.920
-MATT: Good Lord. -Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.920
I had my own guide.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.040
I don't know, it was amazing.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.280
I bet it was.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.720
So, have you ever seen a Bonelli's Eagle, Alec?

00:57.720 --> 00:59.880
It's okay to say no.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.400
I'll make a start with the clearing up, then.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.800
-That's my job. -MARK: No, no.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.640
Let Doris get her pinny out.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.880
YASMIN: I'll give you a hand.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.160
So, are we going to see the Saint-Marie Green

01:07.920 --> 01:11.160
tomorrow, Cap?

01:11.200 --> 01:14.280
I'll do me best, guv, I'll do me best.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.240
I went to Borneo a couple of months ago.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.720
Did the northern mountain range.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.640
-I wish.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.400
They don't think it's going to survive, you know.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.160
There are only two breeding pairs, last I heard.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.480
-That's terrible. -There were 18 pairs,

01:24.200 --> 01:27.480
no more than three years ago.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.200
-Poachers.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.760
-The eggs.

01:31.800 --> 01:35.280
MATT: I'm so jealous. I've always wanted to see

01:31.800 --> 01:35.280
that part of the world.

01:37.600 --> 01:41.240
Er, Madagascar, Vietnam. Nepal on the way back.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.840
Oh, super!

01:42.880 --> 01:45.080
Yeah, I get away when I can.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.080
YASMIN: Someone should teach him some manners.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.200
Yes.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.120
They probably should.

01:56.360 --> 01:57.760
ALEC: Mmm-hmm.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.360
What do you want me to do? There's no signal up here.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.160
We can go back now if you want.

02:01.200 --> 02:04.200
What, and miss the chance of seeing the Green?

02:04.240 --> 02:07.080
MATT: Good night's sleep, up at dawn,

02:07.120 --> 02:10.120
quick bite to eat, then down to the hide.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.200
Look, don't worry, it'll keep.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.360
Yasmin

02:44.400 --> 02:46.560
Don't suppose you fancy a nightcap?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.760
You know I don't. Now, go to bed!

03:04.000 --> 03:06.800
YASMIN: Mr Burton, quick, wake up! It's Mr Talbot.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.480
He's going without you!

03:08.520 --> 03:10.400
He's trying to see the Green first.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.040
Look!

03:13.560 --> 03:14.720
ALEC: What the...

03:15.720 --> 03:17.000
Sneaky...

03:17.040 --> 03:18.720
YASMIN: Come on, everyone. Up!

03:21.160 --> 03:23.360
YASMIN: We need to get moving.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.680
-Mr Talbot's already left.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.040
-Minute or so.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.520
-MATT: Okay, just give me a sec.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.520
-Oh, joy!

03:30.560 --> 03:32.280
You'd better get your trousers on.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.800
-It's a bit underhand,

03:32.320 --> 03:34.800
even for him.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.920
-Right, come on, everyone. Quickly, come on!

03:34.840 --> 03:37.920
-All right, all right!

03:41.240 --> 03:44.080
That's them! The Greens!

03:44.120 --> 03:46.200
Yeah, I'm worried he's seen them,

03:44.120 --> 03:46.200
then scared them away.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.120
Morning.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.640
Ah! Morning, Camille.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.640
Sorry, erm, must have, er...

04:49.680 --> 04:50.880
Oh, you, erm...

04:53.160 --> 04:55.080
-Yeah. -Ah, coffee.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.280
What's the occasion?

04:56.320 --> 04:58.120
-Murder. -Right.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.080
-Two ticks. -Mmm-hmm.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.480
Oh, you'll need boots. We're off to the jungle.

05:02.520 --> 05:03.560
Excellent!

05:04.400 --> 05:05.600
What's in the jungle?

05:08.840 --> 05:11.880
One of the group. Mark Talbot, British.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.360
Well, we'd better get out there, hadn't we?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.680
Come on, Camille, no time to dilly-dally!

05:34.800 --> 05:36.160
HUMPHREY: Ah, brilliant!

05:36.200 --> 05:38.400
The parrot reserve, I've been meaning to come here.

05:50.440 --> 05:53.080
So, what have we got?

05:53.120 --> 05:56.920
OFFICER: Well, the victim was here as part

05:53.120 --> 05:56.920
of a bird-watching tour group.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.360
-Yes, to see

05:56.960 --> 05:59.360
the elusive Saint-Marie Green.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.240
Really? Exciting.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.920
OFFICER: He travelled here with his wife. She's staying

06:01.280 --> 06:03.920
at a local hotel.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.400
She has been informed.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.760
He's been stabbed once, through the back

06:05.440 --> 06:07.760
and into the heart.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.840
The knife has the initials MLT engraved on the hilt,

06:09.880 --> 06:11.840
-so we assume it belonged to the victim.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.840
-Mmm-hmm.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.760
There are no prints, it's been wiped clean.

06:13.800 --> 06:17.360
He had a camera on him, a pair of binoculars

06:13.800 --> 06:17.360
and nothing's been taken.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.960
-No.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.840
And this was inside his left shirt pocket.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.320
One sock?

06:24.360 --> 06:26.000
Bit odd. The other one not hereabouts?

06:27.720 --> 06:29.480
-Ew. -Clean!

06:29.520 --> 06:30.720
One fresh sock.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.200
Anything else

06:33.240 --> 06:34.480
-Life list.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.400
Every self-respecting twitcher would have one.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.600
It'll be a notebook, a list of all the birds they've seen,

06:40.360 --> 06:43.320
Yes, it's a hardcore birdwatcher.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.360
-Hmm. -Is there something

06:43.360 --> 06:45.360
you want to tell us, Chief?

06:45.400 --> 06:47.120
No, I...

06:47.160 --> 06:51.200
Well, I may have done a bit of bird-watching in my youth.

06:51.240 --> 06:56.200
Just me, the trees, a lesser-spotted grebe or two.

06:59.880 --> 07:03.320
-Well, there was no notebook, no.

06:59.880 --> 07:03.320
-Ah.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.640
-The rest of the tour group.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.520
They were all together when they found him.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.360
But our man was on his own. Why?

07:10.400 --> 07:13.080
The staff think he wanted to beat the others

07:10.400 --> 07:13.080
to see the bird first.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.800
So once they saw him go, they followed him here.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.320
-About a couple of minutes.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.080
Okay, and where is camp, exactly?

07:19.120 --> 07:21.320
About half a mile that way.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.600
Okay, so tell me about this tour.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.920
DWAYNE: It was an organised trip,

07:26.960 --> 07:29.080
two members of staff and four guests,

07:29.120 --> 07:31.240
all hoping to see the Saint-Marie Green.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.200
-I didn't ask, Chief.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.240
Pity.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.960
So, what do we know about the others?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.440
We have Alec Burton,

07:41.480 --> 07:44.480
he's from the same bird-watching club

07:41.480 --> 07:44.480
as Mr Talbot in the UK.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.680
Seems a bit odd.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.840
Matthew Webster, specialises in bird photography.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.720
Been on a couple of previous trips with Mr Talbot.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.520
He's a bit odd, too.

07:54.560 --> 07:57.080
Daniel Parish, new to the group.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.360
He's a birdwatcher and freelance journalist.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.360
Let me guess, a bit odd?

08:01.400 --> 08:04.200
-A wild stab in the dark.

08:04.240 --> 08:08.320
Anyway, Mr Parish got very excited when he talked

08:04.240 --> 08:08.320
about the parrot.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.240
Well, to be honest with you, they all did. Very odd.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.400
Odd, perhaps, but not entirely surprising.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.280
It is, after all, why they're all here.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.680
And the staff?

08:16.720 --> 08:19.640
Yasmin Blake, casual worker, just here for the season,

08:19.680 --> 08:22.160
and Captain Jack Parrot, the tour leader.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.880
Now, I know Captain Jack from way back in the day.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.000
He's a bit of a rogue, but harmless enough, you know.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.600
The fellow taking pictures,

08:28.640 --> 08:31.160
get the camera and any memory cards for me.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.160
Could be useful.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.360
With pleasure, Chief.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.040
Hmm.  So,

08:34.080 --> 08:35.600
apart from our two members of staff

08:35.640 --> 08:37.520
and three fellow twitchers...

08:37.560 --> 08:39.600
-I can't let you have it, it's actually quite valuable.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.600
-Yes, give it to me.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.600
-No one, sir.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.560
Reserve security is pretty tight.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.160
The Saint-Marie Green is extremely rare

08:45.200 --> 08:47.160
and protected by the government.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.160
It's all fenced off.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.800
Security cameras at the entrance show that

08:47.200 --> 08:49.800
no one else came in or out

08:49.840 --> 08:51.080
since the group arrived yesterday.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.520
So what's the likelihood

08:52.560 --> 08:54.600
of a member of the general public

08:52.560 --> 08:54.600
scaling the fence,

08:54.640 --> 08:56.400
fighting their way through the jungle unnoticed

08:56.440 --> 08:58.920
in order to plunge a knife into Mr Talbot's back?

08:58.960 --> 09:00.320
-Not very likely. -No.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.520
It would appear that the world of bird-watching

09:02.560 --> 09:05.120
may be slightly more cut-throat

09:02.560 --> 09:05.120
than one might assume.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.680
HUMPHREY: Ah! Captain Jack Parrot!

09:11.720 --> 09:13.920
A triumph of nominative determinism.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.080
Your name.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.760
Parrot.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.600
-The business you're in. -His real name's

09:18.800 --> 09:21.600
Jack Stanton, sir.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.280
What a shame. Never mind.

09:23.320 --> 09:27.120
Er, so, tell me, er, how does this tour of yours

09:23.320 --> 09:27.120
work, exactly?

09:27.160 --> 09:29.680
We've got 16 species of parrot here.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.720
-Yeah!

09:31.760 --> 09:35.440
But mostly they come to see the, er, Saint-Marie Green.

09:35.480 --> 09:38.680
They're incredibly rare. Only one nesting pair left.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.000
I have a deal with the parrot reserve

09:41.040 --> 09:44.920
to officially conduct tours for interested parties,

09:44.960 --> 09:46.880
mainly birdwatchers.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.480
Can you take us through what happened this morning?

09:49.520 --> 09:51.080
I woke Mr Burton.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.240
Any particular reason?

09:52.280 --> 09:55.840
To be honest, I felt a bit sorry for him.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.120
Mr Talbot was always belittling him.

09:58.160 --> 10:00.800
So, have you ever seen the Bonelli's Eagle, Alec?

10:00.840 --> 10:02.440
It's okay to say no.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.360
You felt he was trying to outdo Mr Burton

10:06.400 --> 10:09.280
-Yes.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.360
How long till you all followed?

10:11.400 --> 10:14.520
Two, three minutes, I suppose.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.360
I mean, they were all pretty angry.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.800
And you all stayed together on the trail

10:16.400 --> 10:18.800
until you found the body?

10:19.200 --> 10:20.280
Yes.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.880
It was awful. I mean, that poor man!

10:32.200 --> 10:34.640
So, you and Miss Blake must've been the last people

10:34.680 --> 10:37.880
-to see Mr Talbot alive. -Yes, I suppose we were.

10:38.760 --> 10:39.760
Look!

10:41.040 --> 10:42.080
What the...

10:44.040 --> 10:45.320
Sneaky...

10:48.120 --> 10:50.960
It wasn't right, sneaking off like that.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.240
Quite. You must have been angry.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.960
Seething, if I'm honest.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.760
So, you didn't get on?

10:56.800 --> 10:58.720
Look, he's not... Ah, sorry,

10:58.760 --> 11:01.280
he wasn't, really, my kind of person.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.000
But you were both twitchers, members of the same club.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.760
Birders. The correct term is "birders".

11:06.800 --> 11:08.320
-Birders. -And, actually,

11:08.360 --> 11:11.880
common interest doesn't necessarily

11:08.360 --> 11:11.880
guarantee friendship.

11:11.920 --> 11:17.040
Let's just say, he was a difficult man to like.

11:17.080 --> 11:20.680
If I'm perfectly honest, I can fully understand why someone

11:17.080 --> 11:20.680
might want to murder him.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.640
But, er, it certainly wasn't me.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.000
Did you know Mr Talbot well?

11:29.040 --> 11:31.440
Er, no, no, look, when can I get my camera back?

11:31.480 --> 11:32.920
But you've been on trips with him before?

11:32.960 --> 11:35.200
Once... Once or twice maybe.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.560
-It's very valuable, you know. -Yeah.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.200
Were you the last one up this morning?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.840
No, that was Dan Parish, I think.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.440
Come on, everyone. Up!

11:43.480 --> 11:46.320
-CAMILLE: Minute or so.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.800
You'd better get your trousers on.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.200
And the rest of the group,

11:49.240 --> 11:50.840
did you form any impression of them?

11:50.880 --> 11:52.200
Not really.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.880
No, look, I can come to the station if that...

11:54.920 --> 11:56.720
-If that helps. -No, that won't be necessary,

11:56.760 --> 11:59.400
we're just trying to establish your relationship

11:56.760 --> 11:59.400
with Mr Talbot.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.720
I need to get my camera!

12:03.200 --> 12:04.840
So, you're a journalist?

12:04.880 --> 12:07.640
Well, I write the odd article for the bird magazines.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.840
-Indeed.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.000
-It's just a scratch.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.000
I free climb.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.960
-Yeah.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.200
No ropes.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.000
Hell of a rush, you should try it some time.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.000
Yes, well, I've never been much good at climbing.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.120
Falling down, I am good at. A dab hand, you might say!

12:32.600 --> 12:36.080
Were you aware of any antagonism between

12:32.600 --> 12:36.080
Mr Talbot and Mr Burton?

12:36.120 --> 12:38.160
Well, that was the first time we'd met,

12:38.200 --> 12:40.800
but Talbot did seem to enjoy winding him up.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.520
Let Doris get her pinny out!

12:43.960 --> 12:45.560
Did he have problems with anyone else?

12:45.600 --> 12:47.400
Let's just say, he was never going to win the prize

12:47.440 --> 12:51.120
for the most popular campmate. He was fine with me.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.920
Do you have a card, in case I run into something later?

12:53.960 --> 12:55.920
Yes, that'll be all, I think, for now.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.680
Well...

13:01.200 --> 13:03.680
-You seem to have made quite an impression on him.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.600
Rather inappropriate, given the circumstances.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.800
Not that I'm saying you'd be interested in someone

13:05.640 --> 13:07.800
like that, of course.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.000
-Oh, you know...

13:09.040 --> 13:11.280
-No. -Well, a suspect

13:09.040 --> 13:11.280
in a murder inquiry.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.720
Ah, yes, you're right, I wouldn't be interested.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.080
-Yes. -But besides,

13:15.120 --> 13:16.840
I've already got a date for tonight.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.520
You want us to release everyone, Chief?

13:24.560 --> 13:27.520
Erm...  Er, er, yes.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.160
Er, yes, I think you can.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.640
HUMPHREY: From the moment Miss Blake woke them up,

13:38.680 --> 13:40.360
after seeing the victim leaving for the hide,

13:40.400 --> 13:43.600
everyone was in clear sight of everyone else.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.080
So none of them could have killed him.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.480
Yet, if we're to believe this area is inaccessible

13:47.520 --> 13:50.400
to anyone else, one of them must have.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.600
-So, it's impossible. -Yet the murder

13:50.440 --> 13:52.600
can't be impossible,

13:52.640 --> 13:54.360
because Mr Talbot is very dead indeed.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.840
So sorry, Dwayne.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.600
-Yes! It is, yes!

14:01.440 --> 14:02.880
Wonderful.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.400
Hmm.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.840
Hmm, right.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.800
So, he gets up early,

14:09.840 --> 14:11.920
he heads down the path to see the Saint-Marie Green.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.800
He takes his camera, his knife,

14:13.840 --> 14:17.240
but not his life list in which he meticulously

14:13.840 --> 14:17.240
details every sighting.

14:17.280 --> 14:21.000
And yet, why, of all things, does he take one clean sock?

14:21.040 --> 14:22.240
It really doesn't make any sense.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.520
-Oh! -Ow!

14:26.880 --> 14:28.800
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.120
That's going to stain, Chief.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.280
Yes, well, I'll change later.

14:35.320 --> 14:38.560
For now, I think we should go and speak

14:35.320 --> 14:38.560
to Mr Talbot's widow.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.560
Yep.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.920
HUMPHREY: Where can we find Mrs Talbot?

14:42.960 --> 14:45.440
CAMILLE: At the same hotel as the birdwatchers.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.280
HUMPHREY: I wonder what he's up to.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.400
Camille.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.160
Back up.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.280
Something we can help you with?

14:58.600 --> 15:00.040
Got a few things to do. What sort of things?

15:02.880 --> 15:04.080
Parrot stuff.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.160
Well, I'm afraid this is now a crime scene.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.080
We'll let you know when you can come back.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.840
We're so sorry for your loss.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.360
We'll be as brief as we can.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.000
Thank you.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.880
We have to ask,

15:25.920 --> 15:29.280
do you know why anyone might have wanted

15:25.920 --> 15:29.280
to harm your husband?

15:30.720 --> 15:33.360
Not enough to want to kill him.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.400
Are you aware of anything untoward happening

15:35.440 --> 15:37.480
since you arrived on, er, on Saint

15:38.880 --> 15:42.200
He was gone within an hour of me unpacking.

15:42.240 --> 15:47.000
Went off to the jungle to see his precious bloody parrot.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.440
You don't share his interest in birds?

15:48.480 --> 15:49.600
God, no.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.600
I didn't mind him doing it,

15:52.640 --> 15:55.640
he wasn't so good with all of this.

15:55.680 --> 15:59.320
Were you aware of any problems with the other birdwatchers?

15:59.360 --> 16:01.600
As I said, he didn't bore me with it.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.840
So, you didn't get to know any of them?

16:03.880 --> 16:05.160
I was married to one,

16:05.200 --> 16:08.240
I certainly didn't seek out the company of others.

16:08.280 --> 16:10.040
Did your husband own a hunting knife

16:10.080 --> 16:13.240
with an engraving, the, er, the initials MLT?

16:14.840 --> 16:16.800
Yes. Mark Lawrence Talbot.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.360
He got it in Piccadilly. It cost him a fortune.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.800
-That wasn't... -Sorry.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.320
It appears your husband left camp early

16:32.360 --> 16:34.400
in an attempt to get ahead of the others.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.400
Is that something you'd expect of him?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.600
No, not really.

16:39.640 --> 16:40.920
He was competitive,

16:40.960 --> 16:44.200
but Mark was also a stickler for the rules,

16:44.240 --> 16:45.760
doing things by the book.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.840
He liked things to be just so.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.160
He's not coming back, is he?

16:55.360 --> 16:58.320
Not going to rock up with his big, daft smile

16:58.360 --> 17:01.680
and stupid, stupid shorts.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.000
We can do this another time.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.160
No, really, it's fine. I...

17:08.360 --> 17:11.000
I just feel so awful.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.520
It happened this morning, right

17:13.560 --> 17:16.160
I was having a massage.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.480
I couldn't sleep, so I went down to the spa.

17:18.520 --> 17:21.160
It must have been about the same time...

17:22.880 --> 17:24.240
Please, please, don't upset yourself.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.800
We'll leave it there for now.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.480
If it makes it any better,

17:30.200 --> 17:32.800
he may very well have seen the Saint-Marie Green.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.280
How on earth would that make it any better?

17:37.320 --> 17:38.920
Well, he's a birdwatch...

17:40.720 --> 17:41.880
I just thought... I'm sorry.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.400
I'm sorry, too.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.640
A very impressive woman, Camille.

17:56.680 --> 17:57.760
Oh

17:59.880 --> 18:03.120
-Well preserved. -Hmm, but you wouldn't

17:59.880 --> 18:03.120
be interested in her.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.880
-Heavens, no. -Mmm-hmm.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.240
-Because...

18:09.520 --> 18:11.200
Because she's recently widowed?

18:11.240 --> 18:14.720
No! Because she's a suspect in a murder enquiry.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.400
-Yes.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.360
She just volunteered an alibi, one we never asked for.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.520
Yes, she did! Very well spotted, Camille.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.800
Now, why on earth would she feel the need to do that?

18:32.840 --> 18:36.120
So, Mark Talbot, 51.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.800
Tax accountant for a big city firm.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.440
Apparently, he did very well.

18:40.480 --> 18:44.720
Made partner and enough money to retire at the age of 45.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.680
Since then, he's thrown himself into his hobby.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.880
Yes. If there's money, we need to know who stood to gain.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.440
The wife could have motive.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.320
But the spa just confirmed her alibi.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.640
Can't say I'm surprised.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.560
Logically, it had to be one of the tour group.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.400
CAMILLE: Yes, but they were all together

18:58.440 --> 19:00.680
from the moment he left the camp, right up

18:58.440 --> 19:00.680
to discovering his body.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.080
So, three questions.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.640
Who, why and how?

19:04.680 --> 19:06.400
Yes. Matthew Webster. Photographer.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.720
Had been on previous trips with the victim.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.520
Is there something he's not telling us?

19:10.560 --> 19:12.960
His camera and his memory cards

19:10.560 --> 19:12.960
are on your desk, Chief. Thank you.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.400
Next, Daniel Parish.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.440
Freelance journalist, birdwatcher, daredevil.

19:18.480 --> 19:20.360
Hasn't travelled with any of the others before.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.840
-Hmm.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.160
And, Dwayne, can you tell us about Captain Jack?

19:26.200 --> 19:28.680
DWAYNE: Couple of previous convictions for receiving.

19:28.720 --> 19:31.480
Always looking to make a fast buck wherever he can.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.200
He's been married five times.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.520
STUTTERS) Five

19:36.680 --> 19:39.400
Yeah, bit of a ladies' man. Bit like yourself, eh, Dwayne?

19:39.440 --> 19:41.640
-No, Chief.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.760
He's been married five times.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.440
Right. Yes, of course.

19:45.480 --> 19:46.840
Well, he seemed jumpy.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.000
-Indeed. -Knowing Jack,

19:48.040 --> 19:49.560
he'll be up to something somewhere.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.680
But murder?

19:50.720 --> 19:53.040
-Hmm. -Okay, next. Yasmin Blake.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.800
Well, she's been travelling, got the job at the start

19:53.080 --> 19:56.800
of the season.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.200
-None.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.280
But one of them wanted Mark Talbot dead.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.560
Which is the cuckoo in this particular nest?

20:04.800 --> 20:07.600
Okay! That was the victim's club secretary.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.120
She told me Mr Talbot and Mr Burton have history.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.080
At the Christmas lunch they came to blows,

20:12.120 --> 20:13.680
and Mr Burton threatened to kill him.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.960
And now you move to the top of our list.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.240
Leave it to me!

20:21.280 --> 20:22.640
If you say so. Thank you.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.040
-Go. -Yes.

20:25.080 --> 20:28.200
Right, I think we should go and speak to Mr Burton again.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.600
-Sir.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.880
If the witnesses are to be believed, there is, at best,

20:31.920 --> 20:34.840
a three-minute window from when Mr Talbot

20:31.920 --> 20:34.840
disappeared from sight

20:34.880 --> 20:36.800
to when the others decided to go after him.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.600
So, the question is this.

20:38.640 --> 20:41.200
Could someone have left the camp,

20:38.640 --> 20:41.200
got down to the hide,

20:41.240 --> 20:44.400
stabbed Mr Talbot in the back, and then returned

20:41.240 --> 20:44.400
in under three minutes?

20:44.440 --> 20:46.440
-Leave that with us, sir. -Excellent.

20:46.480 --> 20:49.680
-There is really something wrong with that board.

20:46.480 --> 20:49.680
-CAMILLE: Yeah, must be.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.200
So, you'd better get back out to the jungle, then.

20:53.880 --> 20:54.960
Great!

20:55.000 --> 20:57.360
I was really hoping you'd ask me, you know.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.920
-Yes, you see,

21:00.960 --> 21:04.760
if I can prove that Burton could get to the hide,

21:00.960 --> 21:04.760
kill the victim

21:04.800 --> 21:07.760
and get back on time, I'll have virtually

21:04.800 --> 21:07.760
solved the case!

21:08.880 --> 21:11.440
Hey, I might even get promoted.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.120
We'd both be sergeants.

21:15.160 --> 21:18.960
Only, I'm older, which would probably make me more senior.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.080
But that wouldn't matter, er, you know,

21:21.120 --> 21:24.640
I would never, you know, lord it over you

21:21.120 --> 21:24.640
or anything like that.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.160
-Mmm-hmm. -No!

21:26.200 --> 21:28.280
My reward would come from being the man

21:28.320 --> 21:31.680
who solved one of the Chief's cond... Cond...

21:31.720 --> 21:33.000
What does he call that thing again?

21:33.040 --> 21:34.880
-Exactly!

21:34.920 --> 21:35.960
Yes.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.560
Dwayne Myers, the man who solved

21:39.600 --> 21:42.920
the bird-watching twitcher murder conundrum!

21:42.960 --> 21:45.240
Hey! And who knows,

21:45.280 --> 21:46.960
I could be commissioner one day, you know.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.800
-Yes, ai. -Yes, ai.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.120
Gee, man!

22:55.040 --> 22:56.040
<i>Merci.</i>

22:56.080 --> 22:57.680
Mr Burton?

22:57.720 --> 23:02.160
Blue-backed Manakins. There's a colony

22:57.720 --> 23:02.160
across the way there.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.160
It is a bit common for around here,

23:04.200 --> 23:05.760
but we don't get them back home, do we?

23:05.800 --> 23:07.480
Mr Burton?

23:07.520 --> 23:09.400
Oh, look, there's a juvenile, trying to make

23:07.520 --> 23:09.400
a name for himself.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.760
Mr Burton? Hello.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.280
We've, er, spoken to your club secretary.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.120
Must've been, er, checking up on me, then?

23:20.160 --> 23:23.720
Well, this is a murder inquiry.

23:23.760 --> 23:26.760
Christmas lunch, you and Mr Talbot came to blows.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.360
There were threats. Why didn't you tell us about that?

23:30.840 --> 23:34.000
He was being his usual obnoxious self.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.800
Much like he was last night, by all accounts.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.280
Exactly like he was being last night.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.560
Was it to do with your wife?

23:41.760 --> 23:44.720
You just, er, keep touching your ring finger,

23:44.760 --> 23:47.880
touching something that isn't there any more,

23:44.760 --> 23:47.880
your wedding ring.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.880
Yeah, my, er... My wife,

23:52.920 --> 23:55.000
Pamela, she left me.

23:57.240 --> 24:01.520
November 5th, 10 days before our 16th anniversary.

24:02.760 --> 24:06.000
I'm... I'm sorry. Really.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.560
That Christmas lunch, the first time

24:06.040 --> 24:08.560
I'd ventured out.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.440
Actually, more than that, it was the first

24:08.600 --> 24:11.440
social occasion

24:11.480 --> 24:13.120
I'd been to without her for 16 years.

24:14.560 --> 24:17.080
Mark found that rather amusing.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.320
Even offered an opinion as to why she left me,

24:20.360 --> 24:22.280
wondered why she hadn't left me sooner.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.800
Said I was dull and boring.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.520
Yeah, all true, of course.

24:30.280 --> 24:31.720
So, yes.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.320
Yes, we came to blows.

24:33.360 --> 24:36.440
The red mist descended, I wanted to kill him.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.320
If I'd had a knife in my hand that day,

24:42.000 --> 24:43.360
would I have used it?

24:46.880 --> 24:48.560
Yes, I probably would.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.920
Wow! He really didn't like Mark Talbot.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.440
-Perhaps with good reason. -But how could

24:54.960 --> 24:57.440
he have done it?

24:57.480 --> 24:59.080
See, we keep coming back to that.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.880
We must be missing something. Someone has to be lying.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.200
Diligence and detail.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.160
We go back through the statements,

25:05.240 --> 25:07.160
find the inconsistencies.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.080
HUMPHREY: So we have a motive for Alec Burton.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.000
You really think he's capable of murder?

25:28.040 --> 25:30.840
Anyone's capable of murder if suitably riled.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.640
-Absolutely.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.360
Even the most sunny of disposition

25:33.680 --> 25:35.360
and mild of manner.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.920
It's all a question of trigger,

25:36.960 --> 25:38.600
the right spot to tweak, if you will.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.520
Yes. And...

25:40.880 --> 25:42.120
Yeah.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.480
So you said you had a date tonight?

25:45.520 --> 25:49.000
Yes, another one of <i> Maman's</i> ideas.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.920
He, erm...

25:50.960 --> 25:53.320
He's the nephew of a friend of hers, I think.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.560
-No.

25:55.600 --> 25:58.040
-Oh, gosh, a blind date. How exciting!

25:55.600 --> 25:58.040
-Mmm-hmm.

25:58.080 --> 26:01.480
Do you know anything about him?

25:58.080 --> 26:01.480
What does he do for a living?

26:01.520 --> 26:03.880
Really?

26:05.320 --> 26:06.520
Is that a profession?

26:07.040 --> 26:08.480
I think so.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.920
Yes, I never had much luck when my mother

26:10.560 --> 26:13.920
organised dates for me.

26:13.960 --> 26:16.800
Even my wi... Sally and I... Well, we're getting divorced,

26:16.840 --> 26:19.800
so, er, that wasn't exactly the best outcome, was it?

26:25.840 --> 26:27.600
In his statement, Matthew Webster says

26:27.640 --> 26:30.440
he heard an exchange between Mark Talbot and Yasmin Blake

26:30.480 --> 26:32.920
after dinner, the night before he was killed.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.840
What do you want me to do? There's no signal up here.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.640
We can go back now, if you want?

26:37.680 --> 26:39.720
What, and miss the chance of seeing the Green?

26:41.880 --> 26:43.720
Miss Blake didn't mention it?

26:43.760 --> 26:46.000
No, she didn't.

26:48.680 --> 26:52.160
YASMIN: I guess, I forgot. I mean, you don't think

26:48.680 --> 26:52.160
it could be important?

26:52.200 --> 26:53.520
CAMILLE: Oh, it could be.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.680
Do you remember who Mr Talbot was trying to call?

26:56.320 --> 26:57.760
His wife, I think.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.680
Do you have any idea why?

26:59.720 --> 27:01.960
Maybe they're inseparable, I don't know!

27:02.000 --> 27:04.600
Look, I'm staff. I run the camp,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.600
clean up after them.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.440
He's not likely to tell me, is he?

27:06.480 --> 27:09.440
-It was hard to tell with him.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.080
Is there anything you haven't told us?

27:11.120 --> 27:12.680
Anything at all? It could be vital.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.600
No, I don't think so. Look, I'm sorry.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.240
You started at the reserve two months ago.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.160
Is this your first time on the island?

27:22.200 --> 27:24.120
First time in the Caribbean.

27:24.160 --> 27:27.720
Last year I did Cambodia and Vietnam. Amazing.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.880
Do you always use the same route

27:27.760 --> 27:30.880
for the tour of the reserve?

27:30.920 --> 27:32.560
Since I've been here.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.080
Captain Jack takes us to the feeding grounds

27:32.600 --> 27:35.080
on day one,

27:35.120 --> 27:37.560
then we bed down at base camp, and go to the hide

27:37.600 --> 27:39.760
by the nesting sites in the morning.

27:42.520 --> 27:45.160
Look, if there's nothing else, I really need to get on.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.920
No, that'll do, I think, for now.

27:49.280 --> 27:50.320
Thank you, then.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.840
Why would Mark Talbot want to call his wife?

28:21.880 --> 28:24.400
He'd been gone less than a day and from what I saw,

28:24.440 --> 28:26.120
she was clearly in her element.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.320
Maybe he was using her as an excuse?

28:28.360 --> 28:29.840
HUMPHREY: Let's see if the photographs

28:29.880 --> 28:31.760
from Matthew Webster's camera have finished downloading.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.240
Maybe there'll be something there.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.080
Come on, darling, what about dinner at the Bay Cove?

28:38.520 --> 28:41.240
Really

28:41.280 --> 28:42.360
That's odd.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.560
What is?

28:45.600 --> 28:47.560
Look at these pictures of Mark Talbot.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.960
In every one, he's walking with a cane.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.840
Was there a walking cane found at the scene?

28:57.880 --> 28:59.080
Er, no, Chief.

28:59.120 --> 29:01.160
-No.

29:02.680 --> 29:03.920
Then, where is it?

29:06.320 --> 29:09.160
I'll bring my friend Ronnie.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.760
Ooh.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.040
Oh!

29:17.600 --> 29:20.400
-I don't think so.

29:20.440 --> 29:22.760
What do you mean, you don't think so?

29:22.800 --> 29:24.480
They either did or they didn't.

29:27.840 --> 29:30.800
Someone told them Mr Talbot wanted to call someone.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.960
-His wife.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.360
Jack, what's going on?

29:45.640 --> 29:48.400
Okay, so I worked within the three-minute window,

29:48.440 --> 29:52.480
from the group losing sight of Mr Talbot

29:52.520 --> 29:54.640
to them all heading down the trail together.

29:54.680 --> 29:57.960
First, on the main route from the camp to the hide.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.480
Then, on two further routes

29:59.520 --> 30:00.960
I discovered, here to the east,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.200
and another one to the west.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.880
The jungle is too thick elsewhere for quick progress.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.320
The different routes allow for multiple permutations,

30:10.440 --> 30:12.240
6 minutes 52.9 seconds.

30:12.280 --> 30:15.880
So, none of them could have left the camp,

30:12.280 --> 30:15.880
got down to the hide,

30:15.920 --> 30:17.440
killed Mark Talbot and got back in time?

30:17.480 --> 30:20.320
-No, sir. -So how the hell

30:17.480 --> 30:20.320
did they do it?

30:20.360 --> 30:22.320
-Oh, and one more question. -Sir.

30:22.360 --> 30:24.200
Don't suppose you found a cane?

30:39.480 --> 30:41.640
The man is observed leaving camp.

30:42.560 --> 30:43.560
Look!

30:47.960 --> 30:50.040
The group follows and discovers

30:47.960 --> 30:50.040
his murdered body.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.800
Logically, only someone from that group

30:54.640 --> 30:56.800
must have done it.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.480
And yet, none of them was out of sight of the others.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.080
Tricky.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.560
Yes, you are, as ever, the master of understatement,

31:01.120 --> 31:03.560
Dwayne.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.480
Mark Talbot was trying to make a call,

31:06.520 --> 31:09.080
but we don't know to whom. That feels quite important.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.880
He was using a walking can, which seems to have

31:09.120 --> 31:11.880
disappeared,

31:11.920 --> 31:13.240
which is a bit of a mystery.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.680
He went to see one of the rarest birds

31:13.280 --> 31:15.680
on the planet,

31:15.720 --> 31:17.720
but didn't take his life list. Puzzling.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.200
But he did take a single sock, which is just weird,

31:20.240 --> 31:22.800
but does seem to be quite important, somehow.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.440
We're missing something.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.360
Maybe we should talk to Captain Jack again.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.400
-Hmm. -DWAYNE: You won't

31:27.400 --> 31:29.400
get nothing from him.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.360
He's been interviewed a hell of a lot

31:29.440 --> 31:31.360
over the years.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.680
He is at the centre of all this.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.960
-We could watch him. -It's not a bad idea.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.200
-Well...

31:38.240 --> 31:40.320
Excellent. Then a spot of surveillance on Captain Jack,

31:40.360 --> 31:42.920
-Chief.

31:48.440 --> 31:51.640
Yes, well, it is getting quite late,

31:51.680 --> 31:53.960
not sure we can achieve much more today.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.840
Perhaps, we could look over Matthew Webster's

31:54.000 --> 31:57.840
photographs at the shack?

31:57.880 --> 31:59.800
I've perfected the art of tuna pasta.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.280
Ah.

32:02.560 --> 32:05.880
-Normally, this would be nice.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.680
-Oh! You've got your date! -Sorry.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.240
-The swimwear model. -Mmm-hmm.

32:09.280 --> 32:12.280
No, no, gosh, don't apologise. A night out on the town.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.440
-I should be going. -Yes.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.040
Er, you know what?

32:18.080 --> 32:20.840
I don't really feel much like cooking.

32:20.880 --> 32:24.240
-Maybe I could just pop out and fetch something to eat.

32:20.880 --> 32:24.240
-That's a good idea.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.200
Yes, and it's fish night at your mother's tonight,

32:24.280 --> 32:26.200
isn't it?

32:26.240 --> 32:28.080
-Yes. -Marvellous. I love fish.

32:49.280 --> 32:50.720
MRS BORDEY: You'll be late.

32:50.760 --> 32:51.880
All right, <i> Maman.</i>

32:53.600 --> 32:55.120
-Be nice. -Hmm.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.120
Good evening, sir.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.320
Here are the menus.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.400
And the special dish today is chicken.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.240
Can I get you a drink?

33:49.280 --> 33:52.520
Do you want a cocktail

34:02.680 --> 34:04.960
It's hard work, you know.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.400
Have to stick to a strict regime.

34:07.440 --> 34:11.200
Skin, hair, teeth and eyes, twice a day.

34:11.240 --> 34:15.320
So that's moisturise, conditioner, floss and drops.

34:15.360 --> 34:16.760
Eyes are so important, don't you think?

34:16.800 --> 34:18.320
-Oh, yes. -I mean, I know it's swimwear

34:18.360 --> 34:20.760
all eyes are going to be travelling south,

34:20.800 --> 34:22.760
but the camera picks out your eyes,

34:22.800 --> 34:24.800
so I try and talk through them.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.240
Smile with the eyes,

34:28.680 --> 34:29.760
"smeyes."

34:29.800 --> 34:32.520
Then I wax chest and back weekly,

34:32.560 --> 34:34.120
sack and crack monthly.

34:34.160 --> 34:35.880
Yes, hold that thought. Thank you.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.160
-Hey. -Oh, hey.

34:50.240 --> 34:52.440
-No, thank you.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.880
I'm here with someone. Never mind.

34:55.920 --> 34:59.200
I've just seen Yasmin Blake. Was she here to see you?

34:59.240 --> 35:00.640
The girl from the reserve?

35:02.520 --> 35:04.520
Thought you might be able to tell me.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.960
Well, whatever she was here for,

35:04.560 --> 35:07.960
it wasn't for me.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.480
You sure I can't buy you that drink?

35:10.120 --> 35:11.960
Positive. Thank you.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.480
Have a feel of that.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.160
-Yeah.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.880
All the hard work, that.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.440
-Not far from the main path.

35:34.480 --> 35:37.400
-Or lost in a struggle.

35:37.440 --> 35:40.480
Yes, possibly. Isn't that Captain Jack?

35:42.720 --> 35:43.760
Psst.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.840
-No.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.480
Psst.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.920
Sounds like a puncture.

35:54.560 --> 35:55.600
It's me, Chief.

35:56.760 --> 35:57.920
What are you doing?

35:57.960 --> 35:59.400
I'm on surveillance.

35:59.440 --> 36:00.480
Captain Jack.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.320
You have to ask? He can see you!

36:07.360 --> 36:08.800
But, Dwayne, we're not on surveillance.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.160
Yeah, but he don't know that!

36:10.200 --> 36:13.200
Won't it look suspicious if we just got up and went?

36:13.240 --> 36:17.080
Okay, maybe I'll just come and sit with you guys,

36:13.240 --> 36:17.080
and have a drink.

36:17.120 --> 36:20.280
-But he'll think I'm with you.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.720
But you're on surveillance.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.800
You know, you're right dopey sometimes.

36:25.840 --> 36:28.360
Look, sir, I'd better go. It's getting late,

36:28.400 --> 36:31.200
and I'm aching in places I didn't even know

36:28.400 --> 36:31.200
I had places.

36:31.240 --> 36:32.600
I'll process this in the morning.

36:32.640 --> 36:34.480
Yes, excellent, Fidel. Thank you. Good work.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.240
-Night, sir. -Night.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.760
Oh, and, er, night, Dwayne.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.160
Night!

36:41.440 --> 36:44.280
I don't know. I'm giving up.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.800
-Oh, no, thanks.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.400
So it's just me, then. Great.

36:53.640 --> 36:54.680
Dwayne!

36:55.920 --> 36:57.240
Yes, Chief?

36:57.280 --> 36:59.640
Since the, er, surveillance is getting us nowhere,

37:00.880 --> 37:04.280
why don't you try plying him with alcohol?

37:05.160 --> 37:06.240
Worth a go. He loves a drink.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.520
Hey, Jack.

37:15.520 --> 37:16.840
JACK: I hear you're working on surveillance.

37:16.880 --> 37:18.640
How you know that?

37:18.680 --> 37:20.720
Somebody tell me they see you working

37:18.680 --> 37:20.720
in your undercover shirt.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.400
Oh, this! Yes, I am!

37:25.400 --> 37:26.920
Who you watching, man?

37:26.960 --> 37:28.000
Doesn't matter.

37:28.920 --> 37:29.920
Buy you a drink?

37:29.960 --> 37:31.680
-Sure, man! -Come now!

37:45.240 --> 37:47.680
-Ah!

37:47.720 --> 37:49.520
-Already sorted. -Hmm.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.720
Thought that might be a thing we were doing now,

37:49.560 --> 37:51.720
but obviously not. Fidel?

37:53.960 --> 37:57.760
Right, I might be climbing the walls.

37:53.960 --> 37:57.760
Anything on the cane?

37:57.800 --> 37:59.960
Actually, yes, it's semi-porous.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.400
-Mmm-hmm. -So, it's difficult

38:00.000 --> 38:01.400
to lift prints.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.040
A partial from the victim, a few smudges,

38:03.080 --> 38:05.120
but there's nothing that we can use.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.240
Would you mind showing me exactly where you found it?

38:07.280 --> 38:09.040
Yes, sure. Erm...

38:09.080 --> 38:10.240
I found it

38:11.200 --> 38:12.280
just here.

38:14.240 --> 38:16.040
HUMPHREY: Halfway along the track.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.400
CAMILLE: Sir.

38:17.440 --> 38:20.040
-Mr Talbot's lawyers got back to us.

38:17.440 --> 38:20.040
-Hmm.

38:20.080 --> 38:23.720
Mrs Talbot inherits around £3.2 million.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.960
It's just a pity she was nowhere near him

38:23.760 --> 38:25.960
when he was killed.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.240
-No, I think I can help with that.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.600
Maybe. Look at these. I found them last night

38:33.640 --> 38:36.040
among Matthew Webster's ornithological studies.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.440
And she said she didn't know any of the group.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.040
HUMPHREY: Few too many, perhaps, Dwayne?

38:47.080 --> 38:52.280
Right, let's see what Mr Webster has to say

38:47.080 --> 38:52.280
for himself first, shall we?

38:57.800 --> 38:58.840
Coffee.

39:04.680 --> 39:06.720
This isn't really a very good time.

39:04.680 --> 39:06.720
Can't this wait?

39:06.760 --> 39:08.440
No, it can't, I'm afraid.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.560
GLORIA: Oh, just let them in, Matthew.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.240
Hmm.

39:19.280 --> 39:22.200
Well, that confirms a theory

39:22.240 --> 39:25.200
and scraps an initial line of questioning.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.400
CAMILLE: You lied to us.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.400
You said you didn't know anyone of the group.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.480
A mistake on my part.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.600
I didn't want to complicate matters.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.320
You deliberately withheld information.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.360
You're reading too much into things.

39:38.400 --> 39:40.080
Look, we're just friends.

39:40.120 --> 39:43.080
Oh, for heaven's sake, Matthew,

39:40.120 --> 39:43.080
stop pussyfooting around.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.640
A while ago, we had

39:47.520 --> 39:48.960
a liaison.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.960
It was last August, we were on another

39:49.000 --> 39:50.960
birding trip,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.480
and, well, I'd seen Gloria with Mark before,

39:53.520 --> 39:55.680
but we'd never spoken, not properly.

39:55.720 --> 39:58.640
Mark went off to look at another nesting site

39:55.720 --> 39:58.640
that he'd found.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.680
I came back to the hotel.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.400
I was upset. I'd been abandoned

40:03.440 --> 40:07.680
and, well, Matthew was very kind.

40:07.720 --> 40:10.000
We had a glorious afternoon. Nothing more.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.720
You really expect us to believe that?

40:11.760 --> 40:15.880
I really don't care what you believe.

40:11.760 --> 40:15.880
It's the truth.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.720
Lord, no.

40:18.760 --> 40:21.800
If he'd found out, he would have killed me.

40:18.760 --> 40:21.800
Both of us.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.560
Something you no longer need to worry about.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.360
Your husband was trying to make a phone call

40:27.400 --> 40:28.840
the night before he was murdered.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.160
Do you have any idea who he might have

40:28.880 --> 40:31.160
wanted to call?

40:31.200 --> 40:32.760
No.

40:32.800 --> 40:36.040
Look, Inspector, despite what you may believe,

40:36.080 --> 40:37.440
I loved my husband.

40:37.480 --> 40:40.920
I mean, he could be a pain, but he was a good man,

40:42.200 --> 40:44.480
and I expect you to find his killer.

40:44.520 --> 40:46.960
CAMILLE: She has 3.2 million reasons to want him dead.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.160
HUMPHREY: And her lover was on the scene,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.160
but what use is that

40:49.200 --> 40:51.240
if we're still no closer to working out how

40:49.200 --> 40:51.240
he could have done it,

40:53.760 --> 40:55.680
Yes, Camille, I most definitely am.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.840
-It wasn't great.

41:00.880 --> 41:04.160
-No, not really.

41:04.200 --> 41:07.120
Though I did see Yasmin Blake at Birds Of Paradise Hotel.

41:07.160 --> 41:10.040
Ah. You think she was there to see one of the group?

41:10.080 --> 41:11.160
Maybe.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.280
So, what do you want to do?

41:14.320 --> 41:16.880
See if Dwayne's drunk enough coffee to tell us

41:14.320 --> 41:16.880
about Captain Jack.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.040
I really thought I could drink, you know,

41:21.080 --> 41:23.200
but that man's not human, Chief.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.200
-You've been very brave. -Thank you, Sarge.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.720
Yes, maybe there's a commendation

41:25.240 --> 41:27.720
I can put you forward for.

41:27.760 --> 41:30.320
-Do you actually

41:27.760 --> 41:30.320
remember anything?

41:33.800 --> 41:36.320
No one really liked Mark Talbot.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.960
-Hmm.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.040
Matthew Webster kept away from him.

41:41.080 --> 41:42.680
Oh! We can guess why that was.

41:44.160 --> 41:47.280
Jack didn't really like Daniel Parish or Alec Burton.

41:47.320 --> 41:49.640
He also said that Yasmin Blake was a tease.

41:49.680 --> 41:51.160
First, she was all over him.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.720
As soon as she got the job, she turned into the ice queen.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.360
CAMILLE: Hmm.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.640
-Pretty much.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.320
You don't think he was hiding something?

41:59.360 --> 42:02.200
If he is, the amount I'd have to drink to get it out of him,

42:04.200 --> 42:06.440
Yes, well, I think you can stand down for now.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.640
Thanks, Chief.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.680
Come on, think!

42:10.720 --> 42:12.040
What are we missing?

42:13.440 --> 42:16.440
Why did he discard his cane halfway down the trail?

42:16.480 --> 42:18.560
If he was going to see the Saint-Marie Green

42:18.600 --> 42:20.080
and to do so before the others,

42:20.120 --> 42:22.880
why did he not take his life list

42:20.120 --> 42:22.880
to log the sighting?

42:22.920 --> 42:24.720
Who was he trying to call?

42:24.760 --> 42:26.840
And why, oh, why,

42:26.880 --> 42:30.080
only take one clean sock?

42:39.400 --> 42:42.480
You know, it's a long way from the innocent pastime

42:39.400 --> 42:42.480
of my youth.

42:42.520 --> 42:45.400
Nah! I'm sorry, I don't get what you see in it.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.840
It's boring.

42:47.880 --> 42:50.880
Sometimes, boredom is just the ticket.

42:50.920 --> 42:53.360
Big house, big family, when you're the youngest,

42:53.400 --> 42:55.040
and the joke is generally on you,

42:55.080 --> 42:56.600
even when you still can't really see

42:56.640 --> 42:59.920
what the joke actually is and why it's funny.

42:59.960 --> 43:03.080
It's not boring at all. It's compelling. Joyous, even.

43:04.320 --> 43:06.200
You know, I once spent two whole weeks

43:06.240 --> 43:09.360
watching a house sparrow nest, waiting for the eggs to hatch,

43:09.400 --> 43:11.000
the pair coming and going,

43:11.040 --> 43:14.120
taking it in turns to keep the eggs warm.

43:14.160 --> 43:15.800
It was two of the happiest weeks of my life.

43:18.560 --> 43:19.600
Eggs.

43:23.720 --> 43:25.360
Could it really be that simple?

43:30.520 --> 43:33.800
Fidel! In all the statements, the victim talked

43:30.520 --> 43:33.800
about egg thefts.

43:33.840 --> 43:35.880
See what you can find out. Quick as you can, please.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.400
Check with the club first.

43:43.680 --> 43:44.760
That's it!

43:51.720 --> 43:53.920
I mean, it has to be it!

43:53.960 --> 43:55.760
Look to the simple first, Humphrey,

43:55.800 --> 43:57.240
always the simple first.

43:58.240 --> 43:59.520
You've got it?

43:59.560 --> 44:02.200
I think I've got a "why" or a possible "why."

44:02.240 --> 44:04.360
And, of course, I've got a possible "how."

44:04.400 --> 44:05.680
No, it's the only "how."

44:05.720 --> 44:07.160
Okay. What about the "who"?

44:07.200 --> 44:08.960
Well, the "who" is kind of easy.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.160
Once you have the "how," it's just a case

44:09.000 --> 44:12.160
of simple elimination.

44:12.200 --> 44:14.240
Where are those witness statements again?

44:17.360 --> 44:19.760
So it can't be you, can it?

44:19.800 --> 44:21.240
No, not possible.

44:21.280 --> 44:22.600
Can it be you?

44:23.520 --> 44:25.040
No!

44:25.080 --> 44:26.720
Come on, think! Don't complicate it!

44:26.760 --> 44:27.800
Think simple.

44:29.320 --> 44:30.880
Oh, Lordy, it's you, isn't it?

44:30.920 --> 44:32.000
FIDEL: Sir.

44:33.080 --> 44:35.360
Oh, of course, why wouldn't it be you?

44:35.400 --> 44:36.680
It's you and it works!

44:36.720 --> 44:38.680
-The egg theft,

44:38.720 --> 44:40.320
a full report was prepared for the committee.

44:40.360 --> 44:42.280
-God bless the club committee! -Yes.

44:42.320 --> 44:45.560
Er, Serpent Eagle eggs were taken from a nest

44:42.320 --> 44:45.560
worth thousands of pounds.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.800
There's been a series of thefts recently,

44:45.600 --> 44:47.800
it's all here.

44:50.520 --> 44:51.600
Passports. Visas. Thank you.

44:57.200 --> 44:59.440
A-ha! We have our cuckoo!

44:59.480 --> 45:01.200
-Jeez! -Fidel, Dwayne,

45:01.240 --> 45:04.040
get everyone together, the tour group, staff,

45:04.080 --> 45:07.040
the base camp, I think. We're going to need

45:04.080 --> 45:07.040
Mrs Talbot too. Yes.

45:15.400 --> 45:16.480
Shall we?

45:25.240 --> 45:28.440
Mark Talbot, avid birdwatcher,

45:30.560 --> 45:32.520
arrives on Saint-Marie with the intention

45:32.560 --> 45:35.600
of seeing one of the rarest birds in the world.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.760
The Saint-Marie Green. Fantastic.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.600
He's so excited,

45:42.640 --> 45:45.480
that on the morning he's due to visit the nesting site,

45:45.520 --> 45:47.240
he sneaks off to the hide,

45:47.280 --> 45:51.280
discarding his walking cane along the way

45:47.280 --> 45:51.280
for no apparent reason.

45:51.320 --> 45:53.480
He doesn't take his life list to record the event

45:53.520 --> 45:55.200
as he has done a hundred times before.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.400
But he does take his knife

45:58.520 --> 46:00.920
and a single woollen sock.

46:02.680 --> 46:05.200
Shortly after arriving at the hide,

46:05.240 --> 46:08.240
he is murdered with that knife.

46:08.280 --> 46:11.760
Yet despite him seemingly trying to outdo

46:11.800 --> 46:14.040
and out-manoeuvre his fellow twitchers...

46:14.080 --> 46:17.760
Erm, sorry, birders. The correct term is "birders."

46:17.800 --> 46:20.240
Erm, his wife would have us believe

46:20.280 --> 46:22.360
that he was a man who liked to play fair.

46:23.880 --> 46:25.160
He was competitive,

46:25.200 --> 46:27.440
but Mark was also a stickler for the rules,

46:27.480 --> 46:29.360
doing things by the book.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.640
And the security at the reserve meant that,

46:31.680 --> 46:34.000
although not impossible, it was highly unlikely

46:34.040 --> 46:37.520
anyone from the outside could have got in

46:34.040 --> 46:37.520
to murder Mr Talbot.

46:37.560 --> 46:41.360
In other words, it had to be one of you.

46:41.400 --> 46:44.800
So, which one of you wanted him dead?

46:46.360 --> 46:48.840
His devoted wife and Mr Webster

46:49.800 --> 46:51.880
to stop him discovering their affair

46:51.920 --> 46:55.800
or "liaison," as Mrs Talbot described it?

46:55.840 --> 46:56.960
Aw.

47:00.200 --> 47:03.840
Or Mr Burton, who clearly hated him?

47:05.680 --> 47:07.720
The staff didn't seem to like him much.

47:07.760 --> 47:10.000
In fact,

47:10.040 --> 47:13.360
the only person who appeared to have

47:10.040 --> 47:13.360
any time for him at all

47:13.400 --> 47:14.960
was you, Mr Parish.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.480
Sorry. Thank you.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.360
So,

47:20.400 --> 47:22.600
what actually happened that morning?

47:23.960 --> 47:26.840
Well, Mr Talbot did indeed get up early.

47:30.280 --> 47:32.080
<i>He headed down the trail</i> <i>to the hide.</i>

47:33.400 --> 47:34.680
He settled himself down

47:34.720 --> 47:36.760
to watch over the nesting site,

47:36.800 --> 47:40.600
at which point he was brutally murdered

47:40.640 --> 47:42.400
with his own knife.

47:49.960 --> 47:52.480
Brutally murdered by you,

47:53.280 --> 47:54.360
Mr Parish!

48:01.080 --> 48:02.600
I don't know what you're talking about.

48:02.640 --> 48:05.480
But how can that be?

48:02.640 --> 48:05.480
But he was with us.

48:05.520 --> 48:08.320
HUMPHREY: You see, that was always the problem

48:05.520 --> 48:08.320
with this case.

48:08.360 --> 48:12.560
The "how" was always going to be the key.

48:12.600 --> 48:14.880
You were all together as you watched the victim

48:14.920 --> 48:17.680
walk away down the trail, you all followed him together,

48:17.720 --> 48:21.320
and you found him dead, again, all together.

48:21.360 --> 48:25.360
Fidel, how long did it take to leave the camp,

48:21.360 --> 48:25.360
get down to the hide,

48:25.400 --> 48:27.400
stand still for 10 seconds

48:28.240 --> 48:29.280
and then get back to the camp

48:33.600 --> 48:35.560
Running flat out, just under seven minutes.

48:35.600 --> 48:38.120
You see, it's impossible, it can't be.

48:38.160 --> 48:40.280
Yet it happened. How?

48:41.320 --> 48:43.120
You see, in the end, the key...

48:44.320 --> 48:47.640
The key was Mr Talbot's discarded cane.

48:47.680 --> 48:51.520
It was something so simple, I really should have

48:47.680 --> 48:51.520
seen it sooner.

48:51.560 --> 48:54.120
Ah, Miss Blake, you woke Mr Burton

48:54.160 --> 48:57.560
and you both watched Mr Talbot leaving the camp.

48:57.600 --> 48:59.160
-That's right. -Yes, except you didn't.

48:59.200 --> 49:00.600
What?

49:00.640 --> 49:02.720
Well, you see, by that time Mr Talbot was already dead.

49:02.760 --> 49:04.960
No, no, we saw him, we saw him.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
No, what you actually saw was Mr Parish,

49:09.040 --> 49:12.280
who, thinking ahead, had taken Mark Talbot's cane

49:12.320 --> 49:13.840
and run back to the camp.

49:16.240 --> 49:17.400
Isn't that right, Daniel?

49:19.800 --> 49:22.120
Let me explain.  Now...

49:24.640 --> 49:25.800
Little rudimentary.

49:27.960 --> 49:32.040
You walked down the trail using Mr Talbot's stick.

49:33.360 --> 49:36.520
He's trying to see the Green first. Look!

49:39.520 --> 49:42.240
Sneaky...

49:42.280 --> 49:44.440
You then discarded it here once you were out of sight.

49:51.640 --> 49:55.720
Fidel, how long from where the cane was found,

49:51.640 --> 49:55.720
back to the camp?

49:55.760 --> 49:57.200
Just under two minutes, sir.

49:57.240 --> 50:01.680
So, you see, that's the only explanation for why the cane

50:01.720 --> 50:03.480
was where we found it.

50:03.520 --> 50:07.920
And the "how" led us to the "who."

50:07.960 --> 50:12.840
You see, it had to be the person who appeared last.

50:12.880 --> 50:14.920
Now, in all your statements,

50:14.960 --> 50:19.080
Daniel Parish was the person who appeared

50:14.960 --> 50:19.080
last that morning.

50:20.880 --> 50:22.800
<i>You discarded the cane</i> <i>and ran back along the path.</i>

50:22.840 --> 50:25.600
-Mr Talbot's already left! -MATT: How long's

50:22.840 --> 50:25.600
he been gone?

50:25.640 --> 50:27.080
YASMIN: Minute or so.

50:27.120 --> 50:28.640
HUMPHREY: <i> And when everyone</i> <i>was back in their tents,</i>

50:28.680 --> 50:30.120
<i>you seized your opportunity.</i>

50:40.400 --> 50:42.880
It's a bit underhand, even for him.

50:42.920 --> 50:46.920
We have a "who." We even have a "how."

50:46.960 --> 50:49.760
Which just leaves us with the "why."

50:49.800 --> 50:51.000
The night before the killing,

50:51.040 --> 50:52.920
you were telling the others about your trips.

50:53.320 --> 50:54.440
So?

50:54.480 --> 50:57.000
So Mark Talbot talked about rare eggs

50:57.040 --> 50:59.080
that had been stolen from Borneo.

50:59.120 --> 51:01.200
The last place you visited.

51:01.240 --> 51:04.160
You went on to talk about other places you visited.

51:04.200 --> 51:08.200
Madagascar, Vietnam, Nepal on the way back.

51:10.640 --> 51:15.040
This is a list of high-profile egg thefts taking place

51:15.080 --> 51:16.600
in the past 12 months.

51:16.640 --> 51:19.960
Madagascar. Vietnam. Nepal.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
And Borneo.

51:22.040 --> 51:25.080
Where the nests were in mountain ranges,

51:22.040 --> 51:25.080
on high ledges.

51:25.120 --> 51:27.200
I free climb. No ropes.

51:27.240 --> 51:29.120
Hell of a rush, you should try it some time.

51:29.160 --> 51:31.240
You see, the sale of rare birds' eggs

51:31.280 --> 51:33.080
is a thriving business.

51:33.120 --> 51:36.320
There is only one nesting pair of the Saint-Marie Green left.

51:36.360 --> 51:39.840
Their eggs alone would be worth a small fortune

51:36.360 --> 51:39.840
to any collector.

51:41.200 --> 51:44.320
So that night, as you talked about

51:41.200 --> 51:44.320
your travels

51:44.360 --> 51:45.800
and the places you'd been...

51:45.840 --> 51:47.320
Oh, super! Yeah, I get away when I can.

51:50.840 --> 51:54.440
Only Mark Talbot put two and two together.

51:54.480 --> 51:56.000
He knew about the egg thefts.

51:57.040 --> 51:58.400
You'd given yourself away.

51:58.440 --> 52:01.600
He knew what you were and the danger you posed.

52:01.640 --> 52:03.920
But then, you see, that's only half the story.

52:05.120 --> 52:08.320
See, because the last piece of the puzzle

52:08.360 --> 52:11.920
is how you managed to get Mark Talbot down to the hide

52:08.360 --> 52:11.920
in the first place.

52:14.080 --> 52:16.880
And that's where you came in, isn't it,

52:16.920 --> 52:17.960
Yasmin?

52:18.640 --> 52:20.400
-HUMPHREY: Yes.

52:20.440 --> 52:23.400
You see, I think that's why he wanted

52:20.440 --> 52:23.400
to make that phone call.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.720
YASMIN: What do you want me to do?

52:23.440 --> 52:25.720
There's no signal up here.

52:25.760 --> 52:27.520
We can go back now if you want?

52:27.560 --> 52:29.320
What, and miss the chance of seeing the Green?

52:30.200 --> 52:32.720
Look, don't worry, it'll keep.

52:32.760 --> 52:35.600
HUMPHREY: <i> That phone call</i> <i>would have been</i>

52:32.760 --> 52:35.600
<i>to warn the authorities.</i>

52:35.640 --> 52:39.640
He told you of his suspicions about Dan Parish, didn't he?

52:39.680 --> 52:41.240
Not knowing that you were his accomplice.

52:42.680 --> 52:44.440
-I'll deal with it. -YASMIN: Okay.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.040
-I know what I've got to do. -Yes.

52:46.080 --> 52:49.200
And by telling you, he signed his

52:46.080 --> 52:49.200
own death warrant.

52:49.240 --> 52:50.360
No!

52:50.400 --> 52:52.160
Remind me.

52:52.200 --> 52:55.200
Where were you before coming to Saint

52:55.240 --> 52:57.880
Last year I did Cambodia and Vietnam. Amazing.

52:59.240 --> 53:00.600
HUMPHREY: See, we checked your visas.

53:01.920 --> 53:04.480
You were there at the same time as Dan Parish.

53:04.520 --> 53:07.280
And that's who you were meeting

53:04.520 --> 53:07.280
at the hotel last night.

53:07.320 --> 53:10.440
MAN: And then I have the waxing,

53:07.320 --> 53:10.440
which is chest and back.

53:10.480 --> 53:14.200
I've just seen Yasmin Blake. Was she here to see you?

53:14.240 --> 53:15.640
Why would she be?

53:15.680 --> 53:18.920
HUMPHREY: He needed you on the inside, didn't he?

53:18.960 --> 53:22.160
So that's why you used all your wiles

53:18.960 --> 53:22.160
to get this job,

53:22.200 --> 53:25.320
even giving poor old Captain Jack

53:22.200 --> 53:25.320
the wrong impression.

53:25.360 --> 53:28.040
JACK: Yasmin

53:28.080 --> 53:30.520
You know I don't. Now, go to bed.

53:34.680 --> 53:37.600
You were the one who got Mark Talbot to go down

53:34.680 --> 53:37.600
to the hide early,

53:37.640 --> 53:39.560
no doubt telling him that Daniel Parish would have

53:39.600 --> 53:41.240
to go for the eggs at first light

53:41.280 --> 53:43.920
and that he would have a chance to

53:41.280 --> 53:43.920
catch him in the act.

53:43.960 --> 53:47.840
He even took a single woollen sock

53:47.880 --> 53:50.720
in case he needed to keep the eggs warm.

53:50.760 --> 53:53.800
<i>He wasn't there</i> <i>to see the Saint-Marie Green,</i>

53:53.840 --> 53:56.160
<i>he was lying in wait.</i>

53:56.200 --> 53:58.760
<i>Unaware that he himself</i> <i>was the prey.</i>

54:04.360 --> 54:08.160
Once he was killed, you had to establish

54:04.360 --> 54:08.160
your perfect alibis.

54:08.200 --> 54:10.480
Yes, now for that, you needed

54:08.200 --> 54:10.480
an independent witness.

54:12.600 --> 54:16.120
<i>Your partner in crime, Yasmin,</i> <i>was waiting at the camp</i>

54:16.160 --> 54:18.680
<i>and you told her that someone</i> <i>needed to be woken up</i>

54:18.720 --> 54:20.320
<i>to corroborate your story.</i>

54:22.760 --> 54:24.080
Look!

54:31.120 --> 54:32.680
HUMPHREY: Someone who could swear

54:32.720 --> 54:36.000
that he'd last seen Mark Talbot

54:32.720 --> 54:36.000
leaving the camp,

54:36.040 --> 54:39.960
making it impossible for either of you to have

54:36.040 --> 54:39.960
committed the crime.

54:40.880 --> 54:43.920
An almost perfect murder.

54:47.080 --> 54:50.920
You killed Mark Talbot to silence him

54:47.080 --> 54:50.920
and stay out of prison.

54:50.960 --> 54:54.640
Saint-Marie alone carries a minimum custodial sentence

54:50.960 --> 54:54.640
of 10 years

54:54.680 --> 54:56.680
for the stealing of rare birds' eggs.

54:56.720 --> 54:59.160
You'll both now serve much longer than that.

54:56.720 --> 54:59.160
Take them away.

54:59.200 --> 55:01.680
-No, no, no! I didn't know he was going to kill him!

54:59.200 --> 55:01.680
-Shut up! Shut up!

55:01.720 --> 55:02.960
You said you were going to threaten him.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.560
No, I did not know he was going to kill him.

55:04.600 --> 55:07.200
You lied to me, I'm not covering up

55:04.600 --> 55:07.200
for you any more!

55:07.240 --> 55:09.320
The officer will be happy to take your statement.

55:22.760 --> 55:25.600
Okay, look, I've had enough of this.

55:25.640 --> 55:28.800
Come on, you can tell me right now.

55:28.840 --> 55:30.400
Tell you what?

55:30.440 --> 55:33.040
You've been like a cat on a hot tin roof

55:30.440 --> 55:33.040
since all this started.

55:36.040 --> 55:37.560
Yes, you,

55:37.600 --> 55:40.080
and I've spent enough money on beer

55:37.600 --> 55:40.080
in this place for you

55:40.120 --> 55:42.280
in the last couple of days for you to tell me.

55:42.320 --> 55:45.040
Hang on, hang on. Who am I talking to here?

55:45.080 --> 55:46.880
-Me. -Yes, I know that...

55:49.240 --> 55:53.640
But which you, Dwayne or Officer Myers?

55:54.200 --> 55:55.560
Me, Dwayne.

55:56.760 --> 55:57.960
Pub rules?

55:59.000 --> 56:00.440
Pub rules.

56:00.480 --> 56:02.520
I saw it once, you know.

56:02.560 --> 56:05.720
When?

56:05.760 --> 56:08.440
Must be 15, 20 years ago

56:09.840 --> 56:10.960
up at the headland.

56:11.640 --> 56:12.720
And?

56:12.760 --> 56:14.840
It was so beautiful.

56:14.880 --> 56:18.800
Small, delicate, green.

56:18.840 --> 56:23.480
I knew I shouldn't, but I wanted a closer look.

56:23.520 --> 56:27.440
Crept up to it, I held my hand out.

56:23.520 --> 56:27.440
So close.

56:28.520 --> 56:31.640
And then it came

56:33.240 --> 56:35.400
-Oh! -Sorry.

56:35.440 --> 56:39.600
That was one really angry bird.

56:39.640 --> 56:40.920
Yeah.

56:40.960 --> 56:43.160
Right. Magical memory.

56:44.640 --> 56:47.040
-Mmm-hmm.

56:47.080 --> 56:50.360
One nesting pair left. They didn't make it.

56:51.280 --> 56:52.560
What?

56:52.600 --> 56:53.800
They're extinct.

56:53.840 --> 56:56.800
Ex... Extinct!

56:56.840 --> 56:59.480
-Get a grip!

56:59.520 --> 57:01.880
Who's going to come to Saint-Marie to see

56:59.520 --> 57:01.880
a dead parrot?

57:01.920 --> 57:04.760
Be bad for business. Besides, I've got five wives,

57:01.920 --> 57:04.760
you know?

57:04.800 --> 57:07.240
So

57:07.280 --> 57:09.640
I have, already! Two years.

57:12.680 --> 57:13.760
Listen.

57:14.880 --> 57:16.120
To what?

57:16.160 --> 57:17.520
That.

57:17.560 --> 57:18.560
What?

57:18.600 --> 57:19.720
There it is.

57:20.520 --> 57:22.240
Where?

57:22.280 --> 57:23.520
Oh, you just missed it!

57:25.480 --> 57:27.080
You're a bad man, you know, Jack.

57:27.120 --> 57:29.040
Pub rules, remember?

57:29.080 --> 57:32.280
To the Saint-Marie Green. It ceased to be.

57:32.320 --> 57:34.480
It is an ex-parrot.

57:34.520 --> 57:37.360
-Shuffled off its mortal coil.

57:37.400 --> 57:41.920
Or maybe it was just pinin' for the fjords?

57:45.760 --> 57:47.600
What do you suppose they're laughing at?

57:47.640 --> 57:50.800
Oh, believe me, with Dwayne,

57:47.640 --> 57:50.800
you don't want to know.

57:55.360 --> 57:56.920
Oh my God!

57:56.960 --> 57:59.040
Okay. There's been a murder on Sebastien Island.

57:59.080 --> 58:01.040
DWAYNE: <i> Alexander Jackson's</i> <i>been found shot near his home.</i>

58:01.080 --> 58:02.400
<i>The man owns the whole island.</i>

58:02.440 --> 58:04.160
<i>There's only</i> <i>one house on it. His!</i>

58:04.200 --> 58:06.440
Father always liked to take a walk before lunch.

58:06.480 --> 58:08.760
