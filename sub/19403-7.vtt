01:29.632 --> 01:33.167
Recon? If you don't stop following me,

01:33.168 --> 01:34.636
I'm gonna stab you in the thigh.

01:34.637 --> 01:36.037
John, I can be a huge help.

01:37.372 --> 01:39.106
- Don't go to the hospital.
- Fuck.

01:39.107 --> 01:40.708
What?

03:02.024 --> 03:05.628
First off, no judgments. Agreed?

03:07.329 --> 03:09.363
Good.

03:09.364 --> 03:11.666
Cool.

03:11.667 --> 03:14.001
I have a very stressful walk of life.

03:14.002 --> 03:16.137
Responsible for a large corporation.

03:16.138 --> 03:19.340
And we're not doing too
well, either, frankly,

03:19.341 --> 03:22.009
because of me, I guess.

03:22.010 --> 03:23.878
So I'm compelled, in moments,

03:23.879 --> 03:27.281
to surrender and turn over control.

03:27.282 --> 03:29.483
And let me be clear, this
is not a sexual thing.

03:29.484 --> 03:33.287
This is just a thing about liking
to be whipped about the hamstrings,

03:33.288 --> 03:34.589
here and there, say.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.191
Now let me say a word about that.

03:37.192 --> 03:39.694
Twizzlers? Why?

03:39.695 --> 03:43.464
Well, let me list for
you the number of items

03:43.465 --> 03:47.669
I've unsuccessfully had
applied in the near past.

03:47.670 --> 03:50.572
Electrical cords. Stingy.

03:50.573 --> 03:52.339
Not in a good way.

03:52.340 --> 03:53.975
Wire hangers?

03:53.976 --> 03:57.612
Hey, that's too rough for this guy.

03:57.613 --> 04:00.381
Pencil. You can't get the torque,

04:00.382 --> 04:03.017
proper, from a pencil.

04:03.018 --> 04:05.519
Actual whip?

04:05.520 --> 04:07.789
Cliché. Come on.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.957
Necktie? Makes me think about work.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.059
Shoe lace. You lose them,

04:12.060 --> 04:14.629
then you're walking
around with loose shoes.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.697
Bicycle spoke.

04:16.699 --> 04:18.933
Tried one. Close.

04:18.934 --> 04:22.670
Makes a distracting
whistling and slicing motion

04:22.671 --> 04:24.205
that anticipates the wallop.

04:24.206 --> 04:26.841
So it takes some of the fun out of it.

04:26.842 --> 04:28.409
But your Twizzler?

04:28.410 --> 04:31.646
Well, your Twizzler...

04:31.647 --> 04:33.615
has a friendly heft

04:33.616 --> 04:35.583
and porous surface space

04:35.584 --> 04:37.752
that lets you know it's there

04:37.753 --> 04:39.588
without leaving a mark.

04:41.857 --> 04:47.629
Now, this part might
sound a little out there.

04:47.630 --> 04:49.196
My alarm clock.

04:49.197 --> 04:51.298
This thing.

04:51.299 --> 04:54.569
The first sensation of each new day.

04:56.304 --> 04:58.339
Each new day,

04:58.340 --> 05:00.175
same old sensation.

05:02.711 --> 05:04.245
Not tomorrow.

05:04.246 --> 05:06.848
You guys sleep here, make yourselves comfy.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.683
Not a sexual thing, as I said,

05:08.684 --> 05:11.518
but 6 a.m., let's say good morning

05:11.519 --> 05:13.622
by wailing on me.

05:46.021 --> 05:48.055
Mother.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.257
Please.

06:09.544 --> 06:11.746
- Mr. Candahar?
- Yes.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.180
I'm sorry to disturb you,

06:13.181 --> 06:15.516
but this party needs your attention.

06:15.517 --> 06:16.818
Do you know this woman?

06:16.819 --> 06:18.853
This is concerning?

06:18.854 --> 06:20.755
She is employed by an escort service

06:20.756 --> 06:23.057
and claims you shared intimacy,

06:23.058 --> 06:24.425
and you failed to pay her.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.661
He used me for pleasure many times.

06:27.662 --> 06:31.866
I want to invite you to the
station to find a resolution.

06:31.867 --> 06:33.267
Are you arresting me?

06:33.268 --> 06:35.670
Let's work there, please,
to find a resolution.

06:39.141 --> 06:40.775
I had no
interaction with this woman.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.576
I haven't left my room.

06:42.577 --> 06:44.578
You phoned her the
day she says she was exploited.

06:44.579 --> 06:47.314
I allowed her to
use my phone on the elevator.

06:47.315 --> 06:49.416
Please.

06:49.417 --> 06:51.152
Let's talk in private.

06:51.153 --> 06:53.387
You needn't bring your wardrobe.

06:53.388 --> 06:57.491
You're in a police station.
It's the safest place there is.

06:57.492 --> 07:01.729
It's odd behavior on your
part, toting garment bags.

07:01.730 --> 07:04.231
To and fro, sir.

07:04.232 --> 07:05.768
To and fro.

08:24.246 --> 08:25.947
I would like to send someone over

08:25.948 --> 08:28.816
-
- To get in front of this election.

08:28.817 --> 08:31.318
How close are they?

08:31.319 --> 08:33.087
To what?

08:33.087 --> 08:35.522
To a practical nuclear capability?

08:35.523 --> 08:36.957
It's gonna happen.

08:36.958 --> 08:40.327
This winter, if they want it to happen.

08:40.328 --> 08:45.332
Sorry. I can't allow it at this time, Tom.

08:45.333 --> 08:48.302
Occasionally, in my job, I am told no.

08:48.303 --> 08:52.974
I am told you cannot implement
a particular course of action.

08:52.975 --> 08:54.375
And occasionally, in my job,

08:54.376 --> 08:57.479
I implement that course
of action despite that.

09:00.315 --> 09:02.583
That is what I did in this instance.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.119
I implemented a plan without authorization.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.921
And in this instance, at this time,

09:06.922 --> 09:09.557
the plan began to unravel.

09:13.962 --> 09:15.796
Mr. John Lakeman,

09:15.797 --> 09:17.731
you're requested on floor two,

09:17.732 --> 09:19.901
interview room 216.

09:19.902 --> 09:22.037
Mr. John Lakeman.

09:58.941 --> 10:01.176
Where's the bag?

10:17.692 --> 10:20.295
Doing great, kid.

10:21.363 --> 10:23.430
Hi, John.

10:23.431 --> 10:26.300
So, John, I decided on my demands.

10:26.301 --> 10:28.936
Let's just say I'll share
them with you in Milwaukee,

10:28.937 --> 10:31.005
in the good ol' U.S.A.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.207
Let's just say that.

10:55.230 --> 10:57.298
Hello?

10:57.299 --> 10:58.533
Hello.

11:01.569 --> 11:04.805
Is Charlie... Is Charlie there?

11:04.806 --> 11:06.373
I'm sorry?

11:06.374 --> 11:08.142
Um...

11:08.143 --> 11:10.711
Yeah?

11:10.712 --> 11:12.079
Is Charlie there?

11:12.080 --> 11:14.015
- Who?
- Charlie.

11:14.016 --> 11:15.482
- My dog?
- Yeah.

11:15.483 --> 11:17.718
You wanna talk to my dog?

11:17.719 --> 11:21.822
Yeah, just for a second.

11:21.823 --> 11:23.090
Who is this?

11:23.091 --> 11:25.826
I found him.

11:25.827 --> 11:28.195
I brought him back there to you.

11:28.196 --> 11:31.098
Just wanted to make sure he got back there.

11:31.099 --> 11:34.035
He's back, yes. Thank you very much.

11:34.036 --> 11:35.237
Yeah.

11:36.171 --> 11:38.039
So can I talk to him?

11:38.040 --> 11:40.274
I'm not... I'm not following you.

11:40.275 --> 11:43.110
Just wanted to talk to
your dog for a second.

11:43.111 --> 11:44.545
Big fuckin' deal.

11:44.546 --> 11:46.547
Who is this?

11:48.150 --> 11:50.684
Did you just call someone's dog?

11:50.685 --> 11:54.155
Yeah, a little bit.

11:54.156 --> 11:55.690
A little bit?

11:57.892 --> 11:59.527
What are you talking about?

12:07.135 --> 12:09.103
What's this book about anyway?

12:09.104 --> 12:12.674
What... What are the
structural dynamics of flow?

12:14.309 --> 12:16.443
It studies the difficulty

12:16.444 --> 12:19.181
in moving an element from A to B.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.419
Well...

12:25.420 --> 12:27.088
Fuck.

12:27.089 --> 12:30.857
Yeah, they were all gone.

12:30.858 --> 12:33.660
For some reason.

12:33.661 --> 12:35.162
I'll go back.

12:35.163 --> 12:38.365
You got to get it in there.

12:38.366 --> 12:42.103
She's going to chase
me down, I can feel it.

12:42.104 --> 12:43.970
She's got Alice's name.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.839
The detective.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.811
I called Alice that night.

12:51.413 --> 12:53.447
Hey.

12:53.448 --> 12:55.817
It's going to be okay, John.

12:59.554 --> 13:00.787
Come on.

13:00.788 --> 13:02.224
Yeah?

13:04.058 --> 13:06.427
You know what she's investigating?

13:06.428 --> 13:09.963
- A murder.
- Yeah.

13:09.964 --> 13:12.933
Why's it going to be okay?

13:12.934 --> 13:14.769
Because you didn't do it.

13:23.778 --> 13:25.879
Give me five.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.683
- Why?
- Because you kick ass.

13:40.795 --> 13:42.430
Stop calling dogs.

13:51.573 --> 13:53.574
Remove brakes and
lights from your bike

13:53.575 --> 13:56.076
and wrap the whole thing in black tape.

13:56.077 --> 13:57.244
Yeah.

13:57.245 --> 13:59.480
- Why?
- Why what?

13:59.481 --> 14:02.683
Why am I removing the brakes and lights
from your bike and taping it black?

14:02.684 --> 14:06.320
'Cause I'm doing this thing
tomorrow night in Milwaukee.

14:06.321 --> 14:08.489
Those are the rules.

14:08.490 --> 14:11.292
And replace my shampoo and soap. Okay?

14:11.293 --> 14:12.959
Today, please. It's important.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.328
No sweat.

14:14.329 --> 14:15.629
We land at 8.

14:15.630 --> 14:18.064
I pretty much go straight to work.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.466
- It's critical.
- Critical?

14:19.467 --> 14:22.236
I got this guy smelling
my fucking head. Yes.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.839
Got it, man.

14:28.943 --> 14:30.744
Hello.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.613
- John?
- Yeah.

14:32.614 --> 14:35.482
Gregory Gordon, McMillan HR. Hey, man.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.651
- Hey, man.
- How's the trip going?

14:39.954 --> 14:41.622
Pretty good.

14:41.623 --> 14:44.591
So, John, if a new employee
is unable to produce

14:44.592 --> 14:47.628
the required documentation
within 30 days of being hired,

14:47.629 --> 14:49.596
the employee must present a receipt

14:49.597 --> 14:52.299
for the application for those documents.

14:52.300 --> 14:56.136
So I think you need to get me that.

14:56.137 --> 14:57.471
John, you have a second?

14:57.472 --> 14:59.840
Um... Concerning?

14:59.841 --> 15:01.442
I'm in Human Resources,

15:01.443 --> 15:04.077
and we take that
seriously here at McMillan.

15:04.078 --> 15:06.847
The human part.

15:06.848 --> 15:09.383
Yeah. Okay.

15:09.384 --> 15:10.884
How you doing, you know?

15:10.885 --> 15:13.454
Just overall, not professionally.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.422
- Um...
- Overall. How you doing?

15:15.423 --> 15:17.123
Pretty good.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.560
Are you?

15:19.561 --> 15:21.528
I've been a little busy, but...

15:21.529 --> 15:22.763
Yeah, I hear you.

15:22.764 --> 15:24.130
- John?
- Yeah.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.632
Can I ask you...

15:25.633 --> 15:26.433
Yeah.

15:26.434 --> 15:28.435
Are you happy?

15:28.436 --> 15:30.170
Happy in what?

15:30.171 --> 15:32.773
Like at work?

15:32.774 --> 15:35.276
Well, it's all connected. Right?

15:35.277 --> 15:37.978
It's actually called the
illusion of separation.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.513
Dr. David Bohm.

15:39.514 --> 15:42.649
It deals with the illusion of separation

15:42.650 --> 15:45.018
in regard to personal
versus professional life.

15:45.019 --> 15:46.520
There is none, essentially.

15:46.521 --> 15:50.991
Anyway, I'm a resource for you at McMillan.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.793
You're not just a resource for us.

15:52.794 --> 15:55.462
And if you need help with the human part,

15:55.463 --> 15:57.163
drop on by.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.599
In the meantime,

15:58.600 --> 16:00.000
let me recommend some stress busters

16:00.001 --> 16:01.702
like, say, popping bubble wrap

16:01.703 --> 16:03.304
or just laughing out loud,

16:03.305 --> 16:05.005
even when nothing's funny.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.473
Sound good?

16:06.474 --> 16:07.909
Sounds good.

18:32.454 --> 18:34.921
Hey, it's Ed.

18:34.922 --> 18:37.323
You asked me last week if I would tell you

18:37.324 --> 18:39.593
if John wasn't okay.

18:39.594 --> 18:40.727
Well, he's not.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.797
He called a dog.

18:43.798 --> 18:45.832
Alice, go see him. Go find him.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.400
But you can't leave a trail.

18:47.401 --> 18:50.171
He's involved in something.

19:20.001 --> 19:23.203
I'm at the window
you told me to go to!

19:25.473 --> 19:27.708
Number 15 to window 7.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.177
Number 15 to window 7.

19:44.091 --> 19:46.593
Number 22, window 3.

19:46.594 --> 19:49.163
Number 22, window 3.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.508
Number 48, window 2.

20:01.509 --> 20:04.478
Number 48, window 2.

20:08.315 --> 20:12.653
Number 25, please proceed to window 6.

20:12.654 --> 20:15.523
Good morning. Renewing my license.

20:18.359 --> 20:21.962
Number 18, please proceed to window 8.

20:21.963 --> 20:23.363
Number 18, please proceed...

20:23.364 --> 20:25.198
Do you have your Vehicle
Emissions System Statement?

20:25.199 --> 20:27.568
- The what?
- Your System Vehicle Permission Statement?

20:27.569 --> 20:30.136
I was told I just needed
my current license.

20:30.137 --> 20:32.138
- Who told you that, honey?
- Guy on the phone.

20:32.139 --> 20:34.440
- Don't raise your voice, honey.
- I wasn't... What?

20:34.441 --> 20:35.776
I don't make the rules...

20:35.777 --> 20:37.811
The guy on the phone said that I just...

20:37.812 --> 20:39.512
He doesn't make the rules, either.

20:39.513 --> 20:41.615
You need an Emissions
Renewal Systems Assessment.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.049
- Along with this.
- Can you give me one?

20:43.050 --> 20:45.351
- No, honey.
- You can't just give me one?

20:45.352 --> 20:46.820
- Honey.
- Who can?

20:46.821 --> 20:48.221
You'll have to get back in line.

20:48.222 --> 20:50.891
I waited for an hour and a half already.

20:50.892 --> 20:53.493
They said I just needed
to take this to you...

20:53.494 --> 20:55.929
then get my picture taken.

20:55.930 --> 20:57.598
You'll need to get another number,

20:57.599 --> 20:58.999
take it to the Emissions Standards desk,

20:59.000 --> 21:00.801
I'll process your renewal.

21:00.802 --> 21:03.203
You come back up with
your emissions application.

21:03.204 --> 21:06.039
What was it? Emissions? Standard?

21:06.040 --> 21:08.809
Emissions Systems
Standard form application.

21:08.810 --> 21:11.244
I feel like you called
it five different things.

21:11.245 --> 21:12.914
Get out of my face.

21:16.117 --> 21:18.953
- Guy on the phone.
- Every time.

21:27.328 --> 21:28.630
Samantha Cantar?

21:31.766 --> 21:33.901
One, two, three, smile.

21:35.637 --> 21:37.537
Carlson Sohns.

21:37.538 --> 21:40.240
Father, husband, public servant,

21:40.241 --> 21:43.243
and pretty damn good racquetball player.

21:47.882 --> 21:49.582
Glenn.

21:49.583 --> 21:51.351
Yeah, Tom.

21:51.352 --> 21:53.854
I need a favor.

21:53.855 --> 21:57.257
What do you need?

21:57.258 --> 21:59.359
Some money and time,

21:59.360 --> 22:01.728
some resources,

22:01.729 --> 22:03.197
and some faith.

22:05.099 --> 22:08.936
I've been wondering when I
can finally pay you back, Tom.

22:13.407 --> 22:14.608
Glenn!

22:16.844 --> 22:19.512
- Glenn!
- Glenn!

22:25.486 --> 22:27.388
Fuck, man.

22:28.990 --> 22:30.190
I used a great deal of taxpayer money

22:30.191 --> 22:33.293
-
- To influence a foreign election.

22:33.294 --> 22:37.297
Not... kosher.

22:37.298 --> 22:40.934
I was not authorized to do this. Yet.

22:40.935 --> 22:43.536
I was expected to.

22:43.537 --> 22:47.207
Subsequently, in order to put
out a fire that was created

22:47.208 --> 22:50.076
in the early stages of this illegal plan,

22:50.077 --> 22:51.912
I committed a second transgression

22:51.913 --> 22:55.816
involving a smaller amount of money.

22:55.817 --> 22:58.920
Trivial, really, in the scheme...

23:01.823 --> 23:04.991
The illegal transference of $170,000

23:04.992 --> 23:07.728
to stave off intrusion

23:07.729 --> 23:11.766
by a band of fighting Brazilians.

23:15.837 --> 23:18.772
Of course she said "no."

23:18.773 --> 23:21.007
I mostly hear "no."

23:21.008 --> 23:26.179
Then mostly I'm expected
to proceed. Quietly.

23:26.180 --> 23:27.814
But this time...

23:27.815 --> 23:30.717
Well, Tim, it unraveled quickly.

23:30.718 --> 23:32.618
- Unraveled?
- Yeah.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.454
Can you put it back together?

23:34.455 --> 23:37.523
I'm trying.

23:37.524 --> 23:40.794
Ordinarily, I have time to...

23:40.795 --> 23:44.164
Ordinarily, I make
progress when I'm told "no."

23:44.165 --> 23:45.665
And then I go back with the progress,

23:45.666 --> 23:47.600
and I ask again, and again I'm told "no."

23:47.601 --> 23:51.404
But it's the "no" where
I'm expected to keep going.

23:51.405 --> 23:55.375
This time, if I go back with no progress,

23:55.376 --> 23:57.077
with backward action,

23:57.078 --> 23:59.913
then I'm told "no," well...

23:59.914 --> 24:01.414
and it actually means no.

24:01.415 --> 24:05.085
It also makes the "no" that I first got,

24:05.086 --> 24:07.453
which wasn't really a "no,"

24:07.454 --> 24:09.722
a real "no."

24:09.723 --> 24:11.792
Then you're fucked.

24:11.793 --> 24:14.627
Well, Tim, I'm almost fucked.

24:14.628 --> 24:16.830
I'm at the extent of my budget.

24:16.831 --> 24:18.131
I'm at the extent of my manpower.

24:18.132 --> 24:20.733
My friends, who I count on,

24:20.734 --> 24:24.504
well, they keep dying.

24:24.505 --> 24:28.074
You're probably next. So can we step on it?

24:28.075 --> 24:29.342
What do you need?

24:29.343 --> 24:33.613
I need all the information you can get.

24:33.614 --> 24:37.250
I need to know if we can
make our intended progress,

24:37.251 --> 24:41.321
or if it's time to cut our
losses and face the music.

24:41.322 --> 24:44.090
And maybe go to jail.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.592
I just had to spend what used to be

24:46.593 --> 24:50.897
a pissant amount putting out
a fire that this plan caused.

24:50.898 --> 24:52.632
Sometime in the next several days,

24:52.633 --> 24:55.635
a yellow light's gonna go off
in the General Accounting Office.

24:55.636 --> 24:58.438
The 11 million is black budget.
They can't ask questions.

24:58.439 --> 25:00.440
But that was the whole
fucking black budget.

25:00.441 --> 25:03.109
This $170,000, I have to account for that,

25:03.110 --> 25:06.279
and that can set off an
investigation that exposes everything.

25:06.280 --> 25:11.885
As it stands, I have no way
of getting that money back.

25:11.886 --> 25:15.255
I could be indicted over $170,000.

25:18.225 --> 25:19.393
Well...

25:22.296 --> 25:23.997
I'm gonna take a walk around the block.

25:23.998 --> 25:26.967
- I'll be back.
- Tim, thanks.

25:26.968 --> 25:31.337
Man, Tom, I wouldn't want your job.

25:31.338 --> 25:35.075
That's a lot of "no's"
to have to keep straight.

25:35.076 --> 25:37.110
You make a mistake on one "no,"

25:37.111 --> 25:39.980
you could be indicted for conspiracy.

25:39.981 --> 25:41.282
Thirty years.

25:49.623 --> 25:52.993
- No.
- What?

25:52.994 --> 25:55.996
No. They wouldn't approve the expenditure.

25:55.997 --> 25:59.399
They said we exceeded our
black budget for this case.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.902
It's illegal for me to
use my own money, man,

26:01.903 --> 26:06.106
so I brought some of my private stash.

26:06.107 --> 26:07.440
- Prell.
- Fuck.

26:07.441 --> 26:11.277
- Fuck what?
- I have Prell here.

26:11.278 --> 26:15.015
That's what I've been using, Prell.

26:15.016 --> 26:16.482
Now I have to go to work,

26:16.483 --> 26:20.220
but I can't work at my desk all day,

26:20.221 --> 26:23.623
because the guy who smells
my head sits right there.

26:23.624 --> 26:27.227
So I'm just gonna have
to wander around and shit.

26:27.228 --> 26:29.595
And Leslie's gonna love that.

26:29.596 --> 26:31.631
Okay.

26:31.632 --> 26:34.534
Anyway, your bike's all dangerous now.

26:34.535 --> 26:35.868
Thanks.

26:35.869 --> 26:37.437
No problem.

26:37.438 --> 26:39.272
Chair?

26:39.273 --> 26:41.108
Not as yet.

28:38.159 --> 28:39.759
Hey, John.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.428
Hey.

28:42.429 --> 28:45.431
- John, do you have...
- No.

28:45.432 --> 28:48.401
I don't have any of the
shit you expect me to have.

28:48.402 --> 28:50.170
- But, hey...
- Yeah.

28:50.171 --> 28:53.639
You said on the phone that
you work in Human Resources,

28:53.640 --> 28:57.077
and I am a human or something,

28:57.078 --> 28:59.079
and that you cared about me,

28:59.080 --> 29:01.047
or something like that.

29:01.048 --> 29:02.648
Something like that.

29:02.649 --> 29:05.485
I think I said you're
not just a resource to us.

29:05.486 --> 29:07.153
We take the human part seriously.

29:07.154 --> 29:10.790
Yeah. Cool.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.293
That's cool.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.229
At my other job, I...

29:16.230 --> 29:18.798
Well, you can't even get a chair.

29:18.799 --> 29:21.167
Your former job?

29:21.168 --> 29:25.004
John, are you feeling all right?

29:25.005 --> 29:26.373
No.

29:28.909 --> 29:30.544
Okay.

29:36.550 --> 29:39.219
John, let's take five. How 'bout it?

29:39.220 --> 29:43.823
Are you getting the recommended
eight hours of sleep, John?

29:43.824 --> 29:46.592
- No.
- What are you getting?

29:46.593 --> 29:48.394
Much less.

29:48.395 --> 29:50.096
Like how many hours?

29:50.097 --> 29:51.598
Like no hours.

29:53.134 --> 29:55.569
I mean, sometimes. Small windows.

29:58.905 --> 30:01.207
We're gonna work on that.

30:01.208 --> 30:05.111
Do you feel you have
the resources and tools

30:05.112 --> 30:07.480
to perform your job?

30:07.481 --> 30:09.449
No.

30:09.450 --> 30:10.950
Okay.

30:10.951 --> 30:13.553
We're gonna work on that.

30:13.554 --> 30:15.855
I've noticed you've been
hanging out with Dennis McClaren.

30:15.856 --> 30:21.461
Has that become a valuable
workplace friendship for you?

30:21.462 --> 30:23.896
It was.

30:23.897 --> 30:26.266
Then something happened.

30:26.267 --> 30:29.435
Okay, we can address that.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.571
We can make a plan to address that.

30:31.572 --> 30:34.541
How often do you experience stress, John?

30:37.878 --> 30:40.214
More than average probably.

30:41.815 --> 30:45.185
If McMillan provided you with a discount

30:45.186 --> 30:46.552
to a local fitness center,

30:46.553 --> 30:49.189
would you take advantage
of this opportunity?

30:49.190 --> 30:50.757
Probably not.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.961
I don't know. Maybe.

30:55.962 --> 30:57.430
Like a gym?

30:57.431 --> 31:00.666
Yeah, gym. Fitness center.

31:00.667 --> 31:02.067
Maybe.

31:02.068 --> 31:06.606
John, what time of day do
you feel is best best for you

31:06.607 --> 31:09.041
to participate in a wellness activity?

31:09.042 --> 31:11.311
Before work, during lunch,

31:11.312 --> 31:14.215
after work, or other.

31:15.682 --> 31:18.117
During lunch.

31:18.118 --> 31:21.721
Would you like to participate
in a wellness activity?

31:21.722 --> 31:23.556
Yeah.

31:23.557 --> 31:26.226
Do you like card tricks?

31:26.227 --> 31:28.794
Performing card tricks?

31:28.795 --> 31:31.364
Never really did it.

31:31.365 --> 31:34.534
Never really thought about it.

31:34.535 --> 31:37.270
Card tricks take soothing focus,

31:37.271 --> 31:41.407
time to get right, and delight others.

31:41.408 --> 31:44.244
They can be a real crowd pleaser.

31:44.245 --> 31:46.612
Okay.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.682
So I should do card tricks?

31:51.084 --> 31:54.387
Well, some wellness activity.

31:54.388 --> 31:57.056
Card tricks were just an example.

31:57.057 --> 31:59.393
Okay.

32:02.263 --> 32:04.964
John, repeat after me.

32:04.965 --> 32:09.769
I am a strong and competent businessman.

32:09.770 --> 32:14.974
I'm a strong, competent businessman.

32:14.975 --> 32:15.975
I am a difference maker.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.943
I am a difference maker.

32:17.944 --> 32:19.979
I am well-groomed, healthy,

32:19.980 --> 32:21.547
and full of confidence.

32:21.548 --> 32:24.917
I'm well-groomed, healthy,
and full of confidence.

32:24.918 --> 32:28.422
Does just saying those
words make you feel better?

32:30.123 --> 32:31.392
Not really.

32:33.394 --> 32:36.397
Hey, great start. Give me five.

32:40.901 --> 32:44.003
You're the second person that
asked me to give them five

32:44.004 --> 32:46.872
in the last couple days.

32:46.873 --> 32:47.973
For some reason.

32:47.974 --> 32:49.742
Who else did?

32:49.743 --> 32:51.243
My brother.

32:51.244 --> 32:54.013
Is he a cool guy?

32:54.014 --> 32:57.283
Yeah. He's Cool Rick.

32:59.353 --> 33:00.987
Well, he sounds cool.

33:03.790 --> 33:05.526
Yeah, don't worry.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.729
Just making sure you're all right.

33:10.831 --> 33:12.299
Leslie?

33:16.036 --> 33:18.972
I am. Yeah. Now.

33:20.674 --> 33:23.409
Well, you missed some meetings.

33:23.410 --> 33:24.944
I notice, Leslie.

33:24.945 --> 33:26.347
Some sharing time?

33:29.182 --> 33:31.083
I'm okay, Gayle.

33:31.084 --> 33:32.486
This...

33:34.455 --> 33:36.856
This, what?

33:36.857 --> 33:38.859
What is it to me?

33:40.160 --> 33:43.696
It's more than a book to me.

33:43.697 --> 33:47.600
When I'm challenged personally,

33:47.601 --> 33:51.437
I get back to center with this...

33:51.438 --> 33:56.342
this reminder of...

33:56.343 --> 34:02.848
well, my dedicated better self.

34:02.849 --> 34:04.485
It calms me.

34:06.720 --> 34:10.656
So on the road, I...
I often go find a copy.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.425
Seeing it out there in the world,

34:12.426 --> 34:16.396
it reassures me and reminds me

34:16.397 --> 34:20.099
that there is a order
to things in the world,

34:20.100 --> 34:23.902
and I have my part in that.

34:23.904 --> 34:25.505
Why that one?

34:25.505 --> 34:28.239
Well, I wrote it.

34:29.976 --> 34:32.612
Well, then why don't you just own one?

34:32.612 --> 34:34.679
Well, I don't know.

34:34.681 --> 34:37.149
That might be prideful.

34:37.150 --> 34:42.955
An author with his own
book on his shelf? No.

34:42.956 --> 34:44.790
I'll just borrow them.

34:44.791 --> 34:47.393
I got this one the other day.

34:47.393 --> 34:49.929
And I'll bring it back to Luxembourg.

34:50.996 --> 34:52.833
So, yeah.

34:54.167 --> 34:55.400
I'm okay.

34:55.402 --> 34:57.036
Just been traveling.

35:02.909 --> 35:04.109
Hey, Lakeman.

35:04.110 --> 35:06.613
Leslie.

35:08.314 --> 35:12.251
I marveled at you today, Lakeman.

35:12.252 --> 35:14.787
Okay.

35:14.788 --> 35:18.591
Marvelously wandering here and there...

35:18.592 --> 35:20.860
except to your desk.

35:20.861 --> 35:24.464
Just fucking wandering around,

35:24.465 --> 35:26.265
to and fro,

35:26.266 --> 35:29.201
to and fro,

35:29.202 --> 35:31.471
all day.

35:31.472 --> 35:34.541
I mean all day.

35:35.642 --> 35:38.578
- How old are you, son?
- Thirty-four.

35:40.246 --> 35:42.181
Okay.

35:42.182 --> 35:43.449
Yeah, okay.

35:43.450 --> 35:46.586
That's what you do at 34.

35:46.587 --> 35:50.823
Just wander around.

35:50.824 --> 35:55.761
May I share with you
what I was doing at 34?

35:55.762 --> 36:01.133
I was wandering over to my desk,

36:01.134 --> 36:04.336
then sitting the fuck down

36:04.337 --> 36:08.542
and writing this book.

36:09.843 --> 36:11.745
Thank you, Gayle.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.682
Leslie, can I have a word?

36:16.683 --> 36:19.184
Well, I was just about to dig in, Lawrence.

36:19.185 --> 36:22.254
- Is it important?
- It is, but dig in.

36:22.255 --> 36:26.493
And then stop by my office
later this afternoon.

36:44.110 --> 36:46.846
Hey, honey. We wrapped up here.

36:46.847 --> 36:50.349
Luxembourg. Just having a beer at this bar.

36:50.350 --> 36:53.519
Sending a little video
message to you and the girls.

36:53.520 --> 36:56.421
I love you guys so much.
Can't wait to get home.

36:56.422 --> 36:59.559
I... Holy shit!

36:59.560 --> 37:02.494
Are you choking?

37:02.495 --> 37:04.630
Fuck! What is this?

37:04.631 --> 37:07.600
Herpes simplex one, guy?

37:07.601 --> 37:09.234
But you're choking?

37:09.235 --> 37:12.304
Great. Are you gonna die?

37:12.305 --> 37:14.607
Fuck! What do I do?

37:14.608 --> 37:16.109
I choose life.

37:17.744 --> 37:20.145
I'm gonna give you
mouth-to-mouth, guy.

37:20.146 --> 37:21.947
- Don't, actually.
- I won't.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.250
Don't you die on me! Live! Live, damn you!

37:29.556 --> 37:32.224
My God! My God! I'm alive!

37:32.225 --> 37:34.359
Jesus Christ, I thought I was dead!

37:34.360 --> 37:36.629
That was so fucking close.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.798
Balls move, man. Thank you.

37:38.799 --> 37:40.132
Hey, I have herpes.

37:40.133 --> 37:41.967
You probably got it now, too.

37:41.968 --> 37:45.037
Fuck, man. What am I
gonna tell my loving wife?

37:45.038 --> 37:46.739
Just tell her you chose life.

37:46.740 --> 37:48.373
If she's cool, she'll understand.

37:48.374 --> 37:49.374
Yeah, she's the coolest.

37:49.375 --> 37:50.509
There you go. Cool.

37:50.510 --> 37:52.044
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

37:52.045 --> 37:55.014
- What was your name?
- McClaren, Dennis.

37:55.015 --> 37:57.182
- But you can call me hero.
- Cool Rick.

37:57.183 --> 37:58.183
Fuck.

38:08.461 --> 38:12.732
Hey, sweetheart.

38:12.733 --> 38:14.233
Yeah, we landed safely.

38:14.234 --> 38:16.435
I had to go straight into work.

38:16.436 --> 38:20.305
Um... Honey...

38:20.306 --> 38:23.943
Audrey, um...

38:23.944 --> 38:26.311
There's something that I have to tell you.

38:26.312 --> 38:30.916
And I'm sorry...

38:30.917 --> 38:32.317
to have to tell you this,

38:32.318 --> 38:35.755
but I...

38:35.756 --> 38:38.358
Thanks for stopping by, Leslie.

38:40.293 --> 38:42.595
What can I help you with?

38:45.265 --> 38:49.301
Leslie, our third quarter accounts
have been called into question.

38:49.302 --> 38:51.103
They aren't good.

38:51.104 --> 38:53.072
I wanted to share that with you.

38:53.073 --> 38:57.142
But the board, my mother-in-law,

38:57.143 --> 39:01.014
they are unaware of this as yet.

39:03.717 --> 39:09.755
Leslie, I steered us off course.

39:09.756 --> 39:12.692
I'd like your hands on the wheel, Leslie.

39:12.693 --> 39:14.359
As we close out...

39:14.360 --> 39:17.863
As we close out our third quarter,

39:17.864 --> 39:20.866
I'm gonna step over, Leslie.

39:20.867 --> 39:22.835
I'd like you to step on,

39:22.836 --> 39:25.504
and I don't want my
mother-in-law to know.

39:25.505 --> 39:28.373
Not yet. I want to get
the house in order first.

39:28.374 --> 39:30.910
But I need you for that.

39:30.911 --> 39:35.681
So I'm gonna take your gloves off, okay?

39:35.682 --> 39:37.116
How 'bout that?

39:37.117 --> 39:38.851
Let's get you out of Divisional

39:38.852 --> 39:40.886
and into the whole ball of wax here,

39:40.887 --> 39:42.587
back in the big show.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.157
Starting tomorrow.

39:48.128 --> 39:51.931
Like I've always said, Lawrence,

39:51.932 --> 39:53.266
let's get to work.

39:57.537 --> 39:59.372
But there's one condition.

40:04.544 --> 40:05.912
You got it.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.949
Can we, Leslie,

40:09.950 --> 40:12.484
just wait until...

40:12.485 --> 40:14.787
Until what?

40:14.788 --> 40:16.957
After this weekend's duck hunt?

41:05.005 --> 41:06.471
You're all set.

41:06.472 --> 41:08.607
Luxembourg to Chicago,
then on to Milwaukee.

41:08.608 --> 41:09.775
How long is the layover?

41:09.776 --> 41:11.310
An hour fifteen.

41:11.311 --> 41:13.378
Let's see what seats we have available.

41:13.379 --> 41:15.547
On the Luxembourg to Chicago leg,

41:15.548 --> 41:17.516
we're wide open.

41:17.517 --> 41:20.119
We can hold
that until midnight tonight.

41:20.120 --> 41:23.122
Washington D.C. to Chicago,
Chicago to Milwaukee.

41:23.123 --> 41:25.757
Can I pay cash at the terminal?

41:25.758 --> 41:28.227
Yes. Let's check seats.

41:28.228 --> 41:29.995
D.C. to Chicago is light.

41:29.996 --> 41:33.265
But let's see about Chicago to Milwaukee.

41:33.266 --> 41:35.467
On the Chicago to Milwaukee flight,

41:35.468 --> 41:37.469
it's nearly full, you got
a window seat in the rear.

41:37.470 --> 41:38.503
That will be fine.

41:38.504 --> 41:40.539
All I have left are middle seats.

41:40.540 --> 41:41.941
That's okay.

41:41.942 --> 41:45.444
Okay, you're all set.
That will be seat 23A.

41:45.445 --> 41:46.846
Thank you.

41:46.847 --> 41:49.581
You are confirmed for seat 23B.

41:49.582 --> 41:50.582
Thank you.

41:53.219 --> 41:55.821
So, yeah, sooner is better
on that paperwork, John.

41:55.822 --> 41:57.356
Just to remind you.

41:57.357 --> 41:58.723
Yeah.

41:58.724 --> 42:01.861
And thanks for the pipetalk.

42:01.862 --> 42:03.395
No problem.

42:03.396 --> 42:05.497
We value you.

42:05.498 --> 42:07.967
Okay, cool.

42:07.968 --> 42:09.836
My house. Midnight.

42:11.671 --> 42:12.973
Fuck.

42:28.021 --> 42:30.222
I remember the way your head smells

42:30.223 --> 42:33.758
from the day my head got hurt.

42:33.759 --> 42:35.660
The last smell that I smelled

42:35.661 --> 42:38.330
is the smell that I'm smelling now.

42:40.633 --> 42:42.201
The last smell that I smelled

42:42.202 --> 42:44.669
is the smell that I'm smelling now.

42:44.670 --> 42:46.038
The last smell that I smelled

42:46.039 --> 42:48.273
is the smell that I'm smelling now.

42:48.274 --> 42:49.841
The last smell that I smelled

42:49.842 --> 42:52.344
is the smell that I'm smelling now.

42:52.345 --> 42:53.913
The last smell that I smelled

42:53.914 --> 42:55.548
is the smell that I'm smelling now.

42:58.051 --> 42:59.418
The last smell that I smelled

42:59.419 --> 43:01.453
is the smell that I'm smelling now.

43:01.454 --> 43:03.088
The last smell that I smelled

43:03.089 --> 43:05.390
is the smell that I'm smelling now.

43:05.391 --> 43:06.992
The last smell that I smelled

43:06.993 --> 43:09.895
is the smell that I'm smelling now.

43:09.896 --> 43:11.330
His chatter is distracting.

43:11.331 --> 43:14.799
Can you ask him to stop,
please, with his chatter?

43:14.800 --> 43:17.836
No. I don't work for
you, sir. I work for him.

43:17.837 --> 43:20.372
Because he got creamed by a truck?

43:20.373 --> 43:22.141
- Ally?
- What's up?

43:22.142 --> 43:24.643
Ally, the last smell that I smelled

43:24.644 --> 43:27.312
is the smell that I'm smelling now.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.215
His head.
