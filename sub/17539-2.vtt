(spraying noise)

00:18.977 --> 00:20.354
Hey, Mal.
You busy?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.855
Yeah. I'm in the zone.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.607
‐Can you de‐zone?
‐Not a word,

00:23.607 --> 00:25.567
but I will forgive you
'cause you're cute.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.527
But not cute enough
to make me lose my focus.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.363
There's been a bit
of an "incident."

00:29.363 --> 00:31.281
Oh, yeah.
Your digimage.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.658
That's
definitely not a word.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.910
Your digital image?
"Digimage."

00:34.910 --> 00:35.953
Still not a word.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.287
This.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.289
Mal:
"Mal's a princess
in waiting, alright...

00:39.289 --> 00:43.001
a princess in waiting
to mess up!
Hashtag Princess‐aster"?

00:43.001 --> 00:44.294
That's trending by the way.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.921
Okay, my people
may be evil,

00:45.921 --> 00:47.589
but what you
Auradon kids are doing

00:47.589 --> 00:49.299
to the English language
is cruel.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.426
Not to worry.
I will make it up to Audrey

00:51.426 --> 00:54.388
by posting this wicked portrait
of her as her favorite heroine.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.847
Her mom.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.267
Maleficent's daughter painting
Sleeping Beauty's daughter

00:58.267 --> 01:01.436
as Sleeping Beauty is supposed
to help your digimage?

01:01.436 --> 01:02.604
Do you remember Family Day?

01:02.604 --> 01:05.190
Ugh, Family Day.
Okay, so what?

01:05.190 --> 01:07.526
I should do
some Unsleeping Beautying?

01:07.526 --> 01:10.320
‐That's not a word.
‐I'm learning how
to be Auradonian.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.948
Come on, it's not like
I gave her Captain Hook's coat.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.533
Beware, forswear,

01:14.533 --> 01:16.702
Caption Hook's coat
she will wear.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.330
‐Okay, funny, but stop.
‐(laughs)

01:20.330 --> 01:22.082
Beware, forswear,

01:22.082 --> 01:24.376
Cruella's stole might
give a scare!

01:25.877 --> 01:28.171
‐Mal, enough with the magic!
‐(laughs)

01:28.171 --> 01:29.881
Beware, forswear,

01:29.881 --> 01:32.384
sprout my mother's horns
from Audrey's hair.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.430
‐Okay, but change it back
before someone...

01:39.683 --> 01:42.352
Ben:
...sees it.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.354
I... have
a digimage problem.
