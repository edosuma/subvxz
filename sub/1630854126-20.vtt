WEBVTT

00:02.828 --> 00:04.091
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:04.091 --> 00:06.267
Ugh! Disgusting.
Alright.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.920
Wow, we're just not biting
our tongues anymore?

00:07.920 --> 00:09.618
- This is vintage.
- Okay, no.

00:09.618 --> 00:12.360
There's a green bubble
on the group chat.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.883
I have an iPhone,
but I left the group chat

00:13.883 --> 00:15.798
after Mr. Johnson started
that soup thread.

00:15.798 --> 00:16.929
Uh, it's me, okay?

00:16.929 --> 00:18.975
I-I got a new phone.
A droid.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.368
Wait, there's a group chat?

00:20.368 --> 00:22.152
Look, it's not easy
being green, okay?

00:22.152 --> 00:24.633
Android discrimination is one
of the last acceptable forms

00:24.633 --> 00:25.982
of hate in this country.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.853
There was a pothole
on 50th Street.

00:27.853 --> 00:28.941
I tried
to warn you about it.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.552
Yeah, well, I hit it

00:30.552 --> 00:33.381
because I couldn't read
your stupid text.

00:33.381 --> 00:34.991
I just don't have time
for this.

00:35.992 --> 00:38.342
Go back
to the blue bubble!

00:38.342 --> 00:39.952
Life is hard enough
as it is.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.780
Now I got two classes
worth of grades to finish

00:41.780 --> 00:42.999
and a tire to replace.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.479
You know what?

00:44.479 --> 00:46.176
I would like to see
your phone survive that.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.786
- Let me in the group chat.
- No.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.310
I tried, but they say
you "ha ha" every text...

00:49.310 --> 00:50.485
That's not fair,
and that's not true.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.182
Breaking news, y'all.

00:52.182 --> 00:54.141
You let another camera crew
onto school property?

00:54.141 --> 00:55.707
- Seriously?
- We're from Channel Six.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.013
- Rolling.
- Action news.

00:57.013 --> 00:58.667
The Chief Education Officer

00:58.667 --> 01:00.843
for the Philadelphia
Board of Education is here,

01:00.843 --> 01:03.889
Elizabeth Washington,
with a special announcement.

01:03.889 --> 01:06.414
Every year,
the Philadelphia school district

01:06.414 --> 01:09.069
shines a light on an educator
that represents

01:09.069 --> 01:12.115
what it means to be
an exceptional educator.

01:12.115 --> 01:14.726
And this year,
the award goes to...

01:14.726 --> 01:15.814
Gregory Eddie.

01:15.814 --> 01:17.773
Oh! Oh!

01:17.773 --> 01:18.861
Oh!

01:18.861 --> 01:20.906
This Gregory Eddie?
Me?

01:20.906 --> 01:23.213
Yeah, you,
- with your fine, silly ass.
- Ah!

01:36.922 --> 01:38.707
Could we get some B-roll
ahead of the interview

01:38.707 --> 01:40.752
- with our Mr. Eddie?
- Of course.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.189
We have everything you need

01:42.189 --> 01:44.278
for a motivational
yet emotional package.

01:44.278 --> 01:47.107
Sad kids, mad kids,
happy kids, new kids.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.021
Ignore that kid.

01:49.021 --> 01:50.936
I didn't like that.

01:51.372 --> 01:52.721
Oh!

01:52.721 --> 01:54.592
Congratulations, Gregory.

01:54.592 --> 01:55.854
Thanks, I guess.

01:55.854 --> 01:56.942
This is weird, right?

01:56.942 --> 01:58.422
How can I be
Educator of the Year

01:58.422 --> 01:59.858
if I haven't even been
a full-time teacher

01:59.858 --> 02:01.295
for the whole year?

02:01.295 --> 02:03.601
Well, typically, the award
has been about optics.

02:03.601 --> 02:06.126
And by awarding you, it might
encourage other young Black men

02:06.126 --> 02:09.216
to become
elementary school teachers.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.565
Besides,
it makes them look good.

02:10.565 --> 02:11.914
It's not merit-based at all,

02:11.914 --> 02:13.220
but who wants to live
in a meritocracy?

02:14.221 --> 02:15.874
I don't get it.

02:15.874 --> 02:18.921
I'm also very uncomfortable
with the extra attention.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.750
I'm uncomfortable
in general, but...

02:21.750 --> 02:24.405
Alright.
You guys are killing it, truly.

02:24.405 --> 02:27.582
So, what is the capital
of Alaska?

02:27.582 --> 02:29.105
Tasia.
Juneau.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.672
That's right-- Juneau,

02:30.672 --> 02:32.369
which is also
a very funny movie.

02:32.369 --> 02:35.851
Alright, let's
move on to the Aloha state.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.159
Ohh, I hate geography.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.464
Deshaun, please.

02:40.464 --> 02:41.509
Shut up!

02:41.509 --> 02:42.684
Ooh!

02:42.684 --> 02:44.207
That's Deshaun.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.166
Deshaun's been having
difficulties all year,

02:46.166 --> 02:48.298
but lately,
it's been getting worse.

02:48.298 --> 02:51.693
I tried talking to him,
incentivizing him with rewards,

02:51.693 --> 02:53.608
but nothing's really worked. Yet.

02:53.608 --> 02:57.177
So, I'm gonna be using
my not-so-secret secret weapon,

02:57.177 --> 02:58.569
a parent meeting.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.137
Come on.
Enjoy your recess.

03:01.137 --> 03:02.617
And please don't eat any dirt.

03:02.617 --> 03:05.054
I just added new fertilizer.

03:06.708 --> 03:07.926
Oh, I'm just going
to the bathroom.

03:07.926 --> 03:08.971
You don't need to follow me.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.668
Good. Yeah.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.064
Barbara, this came for you.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.634
I have to go to court?

03:19.634 --> 03:21.636
Oh, wait. This is
a cease-and-desist for me.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.377
Coleman Camping Supplies
seems to think

03:23.377 --> 03:25.466
that they're the only Colemans
that can sell camping supplies.

03:25.466 --> 03:26.902
I got lanterns, too.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.208
You didn't complete

03:28.208 --> 03:30.079
your continuing education requirements.

03:30.079 --> 03:31.820
Every five years,
every schoolteacher

03:31.820 --> 03:34.475
must take
continuing education classes,

03:34.475 --> 03:36.651
as mandated
by the school district,

03:36.651 --> 03:39.654
which means that
after all these years,

03:39.654 --> 03:42.961
I must prove to them
that I can still teach.

03:42.961 --> 03:44.920
It is preposterous.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.400
I'm sure
I completed them all.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.966
Well, the school district
says otherwise,

03:47.966 --> 03:49.011
'cause you're
one course short.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.317
You'll have to complete it,

03:50.317 --> 03:51.622
or you will lose
your teaching license

03:51.622 --> 03:53.450
and you'll be out
on the streets.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.756
Why can't you be
more like Gregory?

03:54.756 --> 03:57.237
Have more educator-of-the-year
energy.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.065
Hey, Ava? Sorry.

04:00.065 --> 04:01.763
I have something pressing.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.286
Can I get your permission
to move up

04:03.286 --> 04:05.897
a parent-teacher meeting
from next week to today?

04:05.897 --> 04:07.029
I'm having--
Sounds lovely.

04:07.029 --> 04:07.856
I have an announcement
to make.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.249
Go bananas.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.380
Okay.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.077
Alright.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.775
Now, remember to keep sounding
out those vocab words,

04:13.775 --> 04:15.559
and you did really good
on that last quiz, okay?

04:15.559 --> 04:17.344
And cut!
That was beautiful.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.259
Actually, Brayden,
I'll give the notes.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.435
So, can we just try
another one

04:21.435 --> 04:24.220
where you give him
a high five?

04:24.220 --> 04:25.743
I didn't do that
for the cameras.

04:25.743 --> 04:26.788
Oh, I know that's clear.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.530
But this one's gonna be delightful.

04:29.530 --> 04:30.531
Delightful.

04:30.531 --> 04:32.272
You can sit down, man.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.925
Um, do you guys think
you have enough?

04:33.925 --> 04:35.013
Like, are we done here?

04:36.450 --> 04:39.279
You're not what I would call
a natural, but yeah.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.281
So, I think we are done
filming, guys.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.586
Great. Awesome.
You can head out.

04:42.586 --> 04:43.892
Right this way.

04:43.892 --> 04:46.329
So-- Oh, my bad.
You're the doc crew.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.939
You're the one with the bird
tattoo, not the snake.

04:47.939 --> 04:49.201
You can stay.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.115
But y'all can dip
like guacamole.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.203
Come on, now. There it is.

04:51.203 --> 04:52.553
Okay.

04:52.553 --> 04:53.815
The door is right down
this hallway.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.207
I'm gonna...

04:55.207 --> 04:57.166
Okay. And we'll see you
at the ceremony.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.997
Ceremony? What?

05:01.997 --> 05:03.520
Well, there's a ceremony,
of course.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.131
There's food, drinks,
spoken-word poem,

05:06.131 --> 05:07.481
children's choir...

05:07.481 --> 05:09.570
- From Abbott?
- Oh, God, I hope not.

05:09.570 --> 05:10.919
Oh, bonus--

05:10.919 --> 05:12.529
we have one
of your fellow teachers

05:12.529 --> 05:14.618
who's gonna present
the award to you herself.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.794
Mm.
Who are you talking about?

05:16.794 --> 05:19.406
Ms. Schemmenti
to deliver, uh,

05:19.406 --> 05:22.887
a speech about your outsized accomplishments,

05:22.887 --> 05:25.542
which I'm sure--Um, could we get
another teacher to do it?

05:25.542 --> 05:27.065
Like,
literally anybody else?

05:27.065 --> 05:28.545
Or maybe I could even
present it to myself.

05:28.545 --> 05:29.981
<i>Attention, Abbott!</i>

05:29.981 --> 05:31.809
<i>After school in the gym...</i> Oh. Shh!

05:31.809 --> 05:34.290
<i>...we'll be having the
Educator of the Year ceremony</i>

05:34.290 --> 05:37.598
<i>for the slim, the sensual,
the strange Gregory Eddie.</i>

05:37.598 --> 05:40.340
<i>He'll receive said award
from everyone's favorite</i>

05:40.340 --> 05:42.254
<i>neighborhood Italian,
Melissa Schemmenti.</i>

05:42.254 --> 05:43.430
<i>Gaba gootz!</i>

05:43.430 --> 05:45.170
<i>Ladies free before 3:00 p.m.</i>

05:45.170 --> 05:47.869
<i>Sponsored by Bone Town.
Oww, oww!</i>

05:47.869 --> 05:50.045
- What the hell's going on?
- Melissa, I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.568
Okay, why me?

05:51.568 --> 05:55.398
So, we like to have
a diverse, kaleidoscopic POV

05:55.398 --> 05:58.314
to bridge the gap between
culture and education.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.533
What this white lady
is saying

05:59.533 --> 06:00.838
is they want
a white lady to do it

06:00.838 --> 06:02.623
because y'all been
acting up this year.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.494
Yes! Thank you so much.
That's right.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.931
Trust me, you don't want to get
on the district's bad side.

06:06.931 --> 06:12.197
- Ms. Schemmenti!
- Ms. Schemmenti!

06:19.988 --> 06:22.469
Hey,
Mr. Educator of the Yeeeear!

06:22.469 --> 06:24.166
Don't do that.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.428
Uh, how's it going
with Deshaun today?

06:25.428 --> 06:27.169
Oh, it's...

06:27.169 --> 06:28.866
it's going.

06:28.866 --> 06:32.304
Yeah, let's just say I'm happy
I'm talking to his mom today.

06:32.304 --> 06:34.437
So, you ready to get
the keys to the city yet?

06:34.437 --> 06:35.830
I hate to break up
this little love-fest,

06:35.830 --> 06:37.309
but I don't have much time.

06:37.309 --> 06:38.528
- What love?
- There's no love here.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.443
Gregory, intro!

06:40.443 --> 06:41.836
Bye.

06:41.836 --> 06:44.099
So, apparently,
I'm supposed to say

06:44.099 --> 06:45.796
some nice things
about you,

06:45.796 --> 06:47.232
so why don't you just tell me
some of the things

06:47.232 --> 06:49.060
you think you accomplished
over the year,

06:49.060 --> 06:50.235
and I'll whip it up
into an intro?

06:50.235 --> 06:51.323
Okay, have a seat.

06:51.323 --> 06:53.021
Alright. Uh, okay.

06:53.021 --> 06:55.893
I feel like we've made progress
on identifying shapes,

06:55.893 --> 06:58.200
although a lot of them got
hexagons and polygons confused.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.421
And then one of them thought a
polygon was the Pentagon, and--

07:01.421 --> 07:03.292
Okay,
just give me something,

07:03.292 --> 07:04.685
anything you thought
you were good at-- go.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.949
I-I don't--
I don't really know.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.907
I feel like I'm below average
at teaching language arts,

07:09.907 --> 07:11.387
which, like,
what does that say about me?

07:11.387 --> 07:14.216
How about I say
you are punctual?

07:14.956 --> 07:18.263
And all the kids love you.

07:18.263 --> 07:21.441
To be completely honest,
I don't know that they do.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.226
But some of them like me.

07:24.226 --> 07:25.749
How about this?

07:25.749 --> 07:28.099
I'm just gonna do, like,
a regift speech.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.753
I'll just repurpose
some of the compliments

07:29.753 --> 07:31.363
I've gotten
over the years.

07:31.363 --> 07:33.540
Okay?

07:39.328 --> 07:41.112
Jacob, I'm going to
ask you something,

07:41.112 --> 07:43.463
and I only want
a "yes" or a "no" response.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.727
Can you help me--
Oh, my God!

07:46.727 --> 07:49.207
Lord, build me a fence.
Yes. What is it?

07:49.207 --> 07:50.905
Calm down.

07:50.905 --> 07:54.865
I need help signing into
a continuing education class.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.085
Okay, well, let's take
a look-see.

07:57.085 --> 07:59.740
Looks like a lot
of goofy acronyms so far.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.785
Mm. A complete waste
of time.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.744
NAP-- Nodding and Praising.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.136
I only praise the Lord.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.138
MUD-- Meeting Under Duress.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.966
Mm, I came up
out of the mud.

08:08.966 --> 08:11.882
FART--
Facilitating A Reading Tyke.

08:11.882 --> 08:14.102
Seems like they wanted
to do that.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.843
And look, most of the seats
are taken.

08:15.843 --> 08:18.323

I was.

08:39.170 --> 08:40.432
And then another one
after that,

08:40.432 --> 08:41.869
and then another one
after that.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.959
And then they gave me
Teacher's Aide of the Year!

08:44.959 --> 08:46.308

Alright.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.970
Nice to meet you,

10:22.970 --> 10:24.711
Just Cassandra works fine.

10:24.711 --> 10:25.929
Alright.
Please have a seat.

10:30.281 --> 10:33.023
First of all, thank you
so much for coming in.

10:33.023 --> 10:35.286
I know it's difficult to do
in the middle of a work day.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.027
Oh, it's fine.
I just had someone pick up

10:37.027 --> 10:39.247
the rest of my shift
on short notice, but I'm here.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.989
I respect that,
- so I'll get right into it.
- Mm-hmm.

10:41.989 --> 10:46.602
So, you know, I've been
dealing with some issues

10:46.602 --> 10:49.344
with your son Deshaun
since the beginning of the year,

10:49.344 --> 10:51.302
minor issues,
and I've been managing them,

10:51.302 --> 10:53.304
but as the year has gone on,

10:53.304 --> 10:54.871
it's just gotten
progressively worse.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.438
Worse? How?

10:56.438 --> 10:58.179
Well, it started off with,
like, small things,

10:58.179 --> 11:00.921
like him calling out the answers
without raising his hand.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.705
But, you know,
now it's started to escalate

11:02.705 --> 11:04.751
to him throwing books and...

11:04.751 --> 11:06.404
The right answers
or the wrong answers?

11:06.404 --> 11:07.797
Well, right or wrong,

11:07.797 --> 11:10.147
it's just disruptive
to the other students.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.323
Mm-hmm, I see.

11:12.323 --> 11:15.326
And look, I know we both want
what's best for Deshaun.

11:15.326 --> 11:16.937
So what do you want from me?

11:16.937 --> 11:17.938
Well, I thought--

11:17.938 --> 11:19.504
Thought what, exactly?

11:19.504 --> 11:21.768
This wasn't my first option,
by the way.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.334
As I've said, his behavior

11:23.334 --> 11:25.641
has been getting
progressively worse,

11:25.641 --> 11:27.338
and I've been trying
to make sure

11:27.338 --> 11:29.471
he's having a successful
time at school.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.212
And nobody's stopping you
from doing that.

11:31.212 --> 11:33.127
He's kind of stopping me, actually.

11:33.127 --> 11:35.172
He's 7.
You can't control a 7-year-old?

11:36.870 --> 11:39.873
Cassandra, it's not
about control.

11:39.873 --> 11:41.135
You know,
we're setting him up

11:41.135 --> 11:42.745
to be the best student
he can be,

11:42.745 --> 11:44.007
and you know,
we're a team in this.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.530
We're not a team.

11:45.530 --> 11:46.836
And I don't see how he could
be the best student

11:46.836 --> 11:48.664
that he could be
with a teacher like you.

11:50.013 --> 11:52.059
Um, excuse me?

11:52.059 --> 11:53.756
And now my boss is calling.

11:53.756 --> 11:56.106
I took time out of <i>my</i> day,
away from <i>my</i> job,

11:56.106 --> 11:57.847
to come down here to hear
you complain about my son,

11:57.847 --> 11:59.762
and you're not even
doing your job.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.678
I'm doing the best I can
with your son.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.201
If this is the best
that you can do,

12:04.201 --> 12:06.856
you are the worst teacher
that I've ever seen.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.685
You know, and you're right.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.339
Call me Ms. O'Neill.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.819
Down here
wasting my damn time.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.356
Janine?
Ah.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.618
What's wrong?

12:29.618 --> 12:35.102
Um, Deshaun's mom, uh...

12:35.102 --> 12:39.715
she called me a bad teacher,
and it was just--

12:41.064 --> 12:42.109
I don't even know why
I'm crying right now.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.719
Look, look.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.634
She doesn't know what
she's talking about, okay?

12:45.634 --> 12:47.288
You're a good teacher, Janine.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.206
Janine?

12:52.206 --> 12:53.511
Who am I going to have

12:53.511 --> 12:57.864
an intergenerational
conversation with?

12:57.864 --> 12:59.082
Oh.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.913
- What happened?
- A parent yelled at her.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.263
I'm trying to help, but I think
- I'm making it worse.
- It's okay.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.396
<i>Paging Educator of
the Year, Mr. Eddie.</i>

13:08.396 --> 13:10.572
<i>Your essence is needed
at the award presentation,</i>

13:10.572 --> 13:12.530
<i>so bring that punim
to the gym!</i>

13:12.530 --> 13:14.576
Gregory, you go on ahead.
I can handle this.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.317
Knock if you need me.
I'll be in my classroom.

13:16.317 --> 13:17.666
Okay.
Go on.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.711
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.935
Uh, so
she comes in,

13:25.935 --> 13:29.243
and I told her
about her son's acting out.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.593
You know, I'm trying to have
a conversation--

13:31.593 --> 13:34.509
cool, calm,
- where we figure out what to do.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.206
I offered solutions.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.555
I was patient.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.819
I told her we're a team.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.472
And...

13:43.823 --> 13:45.433
...she just destroyed me.

13:47.609 --> 13:50.917
She called me the worst
teacher she's ever seen.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.875
Janine, do you believe
you're the worst teacher?

13:52.875 --> 13:54.877
I don't know.

13:54.877 --> 13:57.575
I've done everything I can
for Deshaun,

13:57.575 --> 14:00.230
and it's not enough,
so maybe.

14:00.230 --> 14:02.885
So, what you're gonna do
is pick yourself up,

14:02.885 --> 14:04.234
dust yourself off,

14:04.234 --> 14:07.020
come back here tomorrow,
and do your job.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.978
But I didn't
solve the problem.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.501
I am failing him.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.853
I have been called
a bad teacher more times

14:13.853 --> 14:16.203
than I can ever remember.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.205
People have thrown dirt
on my name.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.468
Others have given flowers.

14:20.468 --> 14:22.687
But it's all a garden to me.

14:22.687 --> 14:25.865
Barbara, I've never
seen you fail a child.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.605
- You always find a solution.
- Oh, please.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.390
I do not always have
the answer.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.348
In fact, there are
some issues and problems

14:31.348 --> 14:34.221
that are just too difficult
for anyone,

14:34.221 --> 14:37.572
even me, to solve
in one school year.

14:37.572 --> 14:41.097
But if you come back here
tomorrow ready to do your job,

14:41.097 --> 14:44.709
having not given up on yourself
or that student,

14:44.709 --> 14:48.235
well, that is not failure.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.890
Sometimes, that's
what success looks like.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.766
So, how long do you think
that conversation was?

14:57.766 --> 15:00.682
You know, let's just round it up
to 15 minutes.

15:00.682 --> 15:04.164
Now, I am going to need you
to initial and sign

15:04.164 --> 15:05.905
my IGAL worksheet.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.429
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah. See? There you go.

15:08.429 --> 15:11.214
Oh, and if you see any more
weeping millennials

15:11.214 --> 15:14.217
roaming the hallway,
please, send them my way.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.176
Okay.
Um, thank you so much.

15:16.176 --> 15:17.220
Thank you, baby.

15:23.313 --> 15:24.924
Hey!

15:24.924 --> 15:26.882
What are you doing in here,
Mr. Educator of the Year?

15:26.882 --> 15:29.058
The ceremony's
out this way.

15:29.058 --> 15:31.800
Look, I don't think I can go up
there and accept this award.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.019
What?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.716
They set up the whole gym
for you.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.718
I wrote you this great speech.

15:36.718 --> 15:39.199
Well, I landed on
a Jalen Hurts tribute post

15:39.199 --> 15:40.765
that I repurposed,
but still.

15:41.897 --> 15:44.291
Honestly, I feel ridiculous.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.075
Like, I don't deserve
this award.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.816
With everything that Barbara
does for the school,

15:47.816 --> 15:49.992
and you teaching two grades,
and-- and--

15:49.992 --> 15:52.386
and Janine getting yelled at
by a parent,

15:52.386 --> 15:54.257
I feel like I'm the last person
who should get this.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.868
Yeah, you're definitely not the
best teacher in Philadelphia.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.348
Or, you know, this school.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.089
Or your grade.
Or even this classroom.

16:00.089 --> 16:01.830
Is there a point?
Like, where are we going?

16:01.830 --> 16:05.225
Gregory, you don't deserve to be
Educator of the Year.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.878
Still waiting for that point.

16:06.878 --> 16:11.100
But I've seen you stick it out
and improve week after week.

16:11.100 --> 16:15.409
You work really hard
to get better, and you care.

16:15.409 --> 16:18.890
So maybe someday, you'll grow
into deserving this award.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.153
But you know what?

16:20.153 --> 16:21.676
They're not gonna give it
to you then.

16:21.676 --> 16:25.201
'Cause you can't choose
when people acknowledge you.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.855
This is your moment.

16:26.855 --> 16:30.902
So just, hey, think of it like
you accept the award early.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.209
Okay.

16:33.209 --> 16:35.733
Maybe I'm like
"Rookie of the Year."

16:35.733 --> 16:37.605
Yeah.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.737
Well, the thing is, you are
still an important member

16:39.737 --> 16:41.913
of this team,
so get in the game.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.135
Yeah!
Let's go, Slugger!

16:46.135 --> 16:49.486
Finally, I'd like to send
a shout-out to all the schools

16:49.486 --> 16:51.445
I haven't had to soft quit
this year.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.142
Not me being
so good at my job

16:53.142 --> 16:54.970
they always tell me I don't have
to come back.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.493
Thank you.

16:56.493 --> 16:57.842
Wow...

16:57.842 --> 17:01.281
so beautiful to see
a LatinX aide

17:01.281 --> 17:03.761
share her why with us.

17:03.761 --> 17:06.634
Now, please welcome
to the stage

17:06.634 --> 17:10.290
Italian-American teacher
Melissa Schemmenti,

17:10.290 --> 17:12.857
who will introduce
our marquee award,

17:12.857 --> 17:14.511
Educator of the Year.

17:14.511 --> 17:17.688
Okay, even for me, this seems
incredibly performative.

17:17.688 --> 17:20.300
You got this, girl!
Do it for Italy!

17:20.300 --> 17:21.736
Got it, Ashley. Okay.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.564
I'm here to present
Educator of the Year

17:23.564 --> 17:25.522
for some God-forsaken reason.

17:25.522 --> 17:28.003
This trophy gets handed out
every year

17:28.003 --> 17:29.613
to some random jabroni,

17:29.613 --> 17:33.922
and this year, it's going to...
an underdog.

17:33.922 --> 17:36.055
When he came off the bench
last year,

17:36.055 --> 17:37.795
we all wrote him off,

17:37.795 --> 17:40.276
like some 53rd overall
draft pick in the second round.

17:40.276 --> 17:41.843
Yes, we did.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.801
But week after week,
this young man stepped up.

17:43.801 --> 17:46.282
And this year,
he is Abbott's first string.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.719
Hell, he's
Offensive Player of the Year.

17:48.719 --> 17:51.157
Educator.
Educator of the Year!

17:51.157 --> 17:52.854
We're happy to have him
on our team,

17:52.854 --> 17:54.551
and with him,
we can go all the way

17:54.551 --> 17:56.162
to the Super Bowl of learning!

17:56.162 --> 18:00.122
Ladies and gentlemen,
your Educator of the Year,

18:00.122 --> 18:03.169
Gregory Thompson Eddie!

18:12.134 --> 18:14.789
Wow, t-thank you,
Melissa, um...

18:14.789 --> 18:16.660
I'm actually a Ravens fan.

18:20.577 --> 18:21.752
Go to hell.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.412
Uh, this is surreal, um...

18:29.412 --> 18:31.371
But realistically,
I can't accept this award.

18:31.371 --> 18:32.589
Cameras down.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.591
I'll accept
on his behalf.

18:34.591 --> 18:37.768
I can't fully accept this award
because I'm still learning.

18:37.768 --> 18:38.987
Cameras back up.

18:38.987 --> 18:40.510
As teachers, we all are.

18:40.510 --> 18:43.339
But every day
I can come in here and teach,

18:43.339 --> 18:46.299
I'm being held up
by some of the most

18:46.299 --> 18:49.432
incredibly deserving teachers
here at Abbott.

18:50.955 --> 18:53.044
This profession isn't
about being the best,

18:53.044 --> 18:54.785
it's about doing your best.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.093
Being a constant
for your students

18:58.093 --> 19:00.748
on the good days, the bad,
the terrible.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.750
It's the showing up
that counts.

19:04.665 --> 19:07.755
Uh, so I'd like
to dedicate this award

19:07.755 --> 19:11.193
to all the teachers
here at Abbott

19:11.193 --> 19:14.631
who show up every day
and give their best.

19:17.852 --> 19:18.896
It's an honor to walk
through those doors

19:18.896 --> 19:20.507
with you every morning.

19:20.507 --> 19:21.508
Thank you.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.081
Thank you.

19:30.081 --> 19:34.608
And please, please give a hand
to this wonderful Black man.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.654
Whoo!

19:40.483 --> 19:41.658
How you doing?

19:41.658 --> 19:42.833
Better now.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.922
Today was tough.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.881
Definitely don't feel like
Teacher of the Year.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.100
You know, funny enough,
neither do I.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.756
Ah.
Aide of the Year!

19:52.756 --> 19:53.931
Mm.
Yeah.

19:53.931 --> 19:55.150
I know that we've always had

19:55.150 --> 19:56.717
a will-they-won't-they
thing going,

19:56.717 --> 19:58.632
but I appreciate how
you've remained professional.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.112
My heart is with Benito.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.550
- Who's she talking about?
- Mnh.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.247
Ah!

20:05.247 --> 20:06.857
Oh, okay.
Oh, wow.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.163
Delicious.

20:08.163 --> 20:10.426
<i>Qué rico,
qué rico, qué rico.</i>

20:12.123 --> 20:13.560
That award is ugly as hell.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.257
- I mean, an apple?
- You think?

20:15.257 --> 20:16.476
I'm pretty sure they got it
from Dollar Tree.

20:16.476 --> 20:17.781
I bet it cost

20:17.781 --> 20:18.869
tree dollars.

20:18.869 --> 20:20.741
Shabba!

20:20.741 --> 20:23.483
Oh, Gregory,
I am so proud of you.

20:23.483 --> 20:24.788
Thank you, Janine.

20:24.788 --> 20:25.833
I am proud of you.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.226
My heart is full of love

20:27.226 --> 20:29.097
even though my pockets
are full of lint.

20:29.097 --> 20:32.405
Oh, Gregory,
our love is so pure.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.145
Actually, I'm gonna go home.

20:34.145 --> 20:35.408
We were killin' it!

20:38.062 --> 20:41.152
- Mm.
- Alright, you're all logged in
for your first class.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.721
Make friends
and learn lots.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.289
Alright.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.986
Let's see who's teaching this.

20:48.986 --> 20:49.987
Okay.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.206
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

20:51.206 --> 20:53.121
<i>I'm your teacher, Dr. Johnson.</i>

20:53.121 --> 20:56.037
<i>Welcome to Intergenerational
Active Listening,</i>

20:56.037 --> 20:59.562
<i>also known as iGal.
Okurr?</i>

20:59.562 --> 21:02.304
<i>The active listening class
that hits different, no cap.</i>

21:02.304 --> 21:04.437
<i>I'll be your teacher,
but not your friend.</i>

21:04.437 --> 21:06.743
<i>And I'm low-key deadass.</i>

21:06.743 --> 21:08.832
<i>You don't like it,
then hop off, bro.</i>

21:09.659 --> 21:11.226
<i>Feel free to chime in</i>

21:11.226 --> 21:13.402
<i>if someone hasn't understood
the assignment.</i>

21:13.402 --> 21:14.577
<i>Ya feel me, stupid?</i>

21:14.577 --> 21:15.926
Stupid?

21:15.926 --> 21:17.276
<i>Did I say that right?</i>

21:19.713 --> 21:21.062
Oh, Lord.

21:21.062 --> 21:22.063
<i>Deadass.</i>

21:22.063 --> 21:24.326
Dea--
