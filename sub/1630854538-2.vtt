you don't need me.</i>

00:49.049 --> 00:52.093

01:02.395 --> 01:03.897
<i>Yes.
- Then let's go!</i>

tried to leave her husband.</i>

01:27.879 --> 01:30.590
<i>Mm.
- Four months pregnant too.</i>

01:30.590 --> 01:31.800
<i>I see...
- It's such a shame.</i>

01:31.800 --> 01:34.302
<i>...just a girl</i>

01:34.302 --> 01:38.306

01:53.404 --> 01:55.490
<i>Does that sound good?
'Course it does.</i>

01:55.490 --> 01:59.285
<i>I don't talk
about the nights</i>

01:59.285 --> 02:03.540
<i>I cried without her</i>

02:03.540 --> 02:05.458
I say she's just--

02:05.458 --> 02:08.378
<i>I'ma need you
to bite down on this.</i>

02:08.378 --> 02:09.712
<i>All right,
take a deep breath.</i>

02:09.712 --> 02:11.923
<i>This will be over
before you know it.</i>

02:23.852 --> 02:25.478
<i>Mama?</i>

02:25.478 --> 02:28.982
<i>When do we get to go home?</i>

02:28.982 --> 02:30.692
<i>We're not going back there, baby.</i>

02:32.318 --> 02:34.362
<i>I liked that house.</i>

02:38.741 --> 02:40.535
<i>Yeah, it was a good house.</i>

02:43.580 --> 02:45.498
<i>But there wasn't any love
in it.</i>

03:00.096 --> 03:01.347
<i>Hello.</i>

03:04.517 --> 03:05.852
<i>Hello.</i>

03:09.022 --> 03:11.566
<i>Good morning.</i>

03:11.566 --> 03:14.485
Good morning.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.864
<i>Don't you still love me?</i>

03:21.409 --> 03:23.369
<i>'Course I still love you.</i>

03:26.831 --> 03:29.459
<i>Well, then,
why don't you kiss me?</i>

03:29.459 --> 03:30.877
<i>Hmm?</i>

03:30.877 --> 03:33.546
<i>Well, then,
why don't you kiss me?</i>

<i>Mm.
- Mm.</i>

03:52.607 --> 03:53.900
<i>You didn't come back
last night.</i>

03:53.900 --> 03:55.902
<i>I know.</i>

03:55.902 --> 03:57.904
<i>Don was waiting for me
when I got home.</i>

03:57.904 --> 04:00.740
<i>He had four squad cars
for backup.</i>

04:00.740 --> 04:02.200
<i>Oh, no.
- Yeah.</i>

04:02.200 --> 04:06.246
<i>Stealing a man's wife
is illegal in Tennessee.</i>

04:06.246 --> 04:09.290
<i>But no Tammy,
no crime.</i>

04:09.290 --> 04:12.543
<i>Hmm?</i>

04:12.543 --> 04:16.256
<i>Is this crazy?</i>

- Uh-uh.</i>

05:35.168 --> 05:37.170
Oh, it's a fantastic country.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.838
<i>Tomorrow, you and me
are heading down there.</i>

05:38.838 --> 05:40.673
<i>And in the morning,
we'll get you a divorce,</i>

05:40.673 --> 05:43.092
<i>and in the afternoon,
a new husband.</i>

05:43.092 --> 05:44.510
<i>Mexico can do that?</i>

05:44.510 --> 05:46.679
<i>Mexico can do anything.</i>

05:46.679 --> 05:48.014
<i>Who am I marrying?</i>

05:48.014 --> 05:50.350
<i>Oh, shoot.
I forgot that part.</i>

05:50.350 --> 05:52.101
<i>Mm, you did.</i>

05:52.101 --> 05:54.354
<i>Which one?
- Um...</i>

05:54.354 --> 05:55.855
<i>That one?</i>

05:55.855 --> 05:58.024
<i>Yeah, that's the most ladylike,
right?</i>

05:58.024 --> 06:00.777
<i>Okay.</i>

06:00.777 --> 06:03.946
<i>Miss Tammy Wynette?
- Mm-hmm?</i>

06:03.946 --> 06:05.823
<i>Will you make me
an honest man?</i>

06:05.823 --> 06:08.326
<i>You make me an honest woman?</i>

06:08.326 --> 06:09.911
<i>You bet.</i>

06:11.037 --> 06:12.997
<i>Look.</i>

06:14.957 --> 06:16.751
<i>Oh, good morning.
- Morning.</i>

06:16.751 --> 06:19.796
<i>Well, uh, mind if I order
for the table, ladies?</i>

06:19.796 --> 06:22.382
<i>We'll get five orders
of double stacks,</i>

06:22.382 --> 06:24.759
<i>five sides of sausage links,
not patties--</i>

06:24.759 --> 06:26.260
<i>Can I have
some hot chocolate?</i>

06:26.260 --> 06:27.178
<i>No.
- Of course.</i>

06:27.178 --> 06:29.222
<i>No. No.</i>

06:29.222 --> 06:30.681
<i>Your mama said no,</i>

06:30.681 --> 06:33.184
<i>but let the record show
I would have said yes.</i>

06:33.184 --> 06:35.520
You are Tammy Wynette.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.896
<i>How very dare you?</i>

06:36.896 --> 06:39.899
<i>You recognized her
before you recognized me.</i>

06:39.899 --> 06:43.403
<i>Oh, I recognized both of you
at the same time, Mr. Jones.</i>

06:43.403 --> 06:45.571
<i>Okay.
Fair enough.</i>

06:45.571 --> 06:48.825
<i>So are y'all here on a--
a breakfast date?</i>

06:50.118 --> 06:52.036
<i>I can keep a secret.
I can.</i>

06:52.036 --> 06:54.247
<i>I am devoted.</i>

06:54.247 --> 06:55.415
<i>Thank you, hon.</i>

06:55.415 --> 06:56.666
<i>And don't you worry, hon.</i>

06:56.666 --> 06:58.209
<i>I won't tell a soul.</i>

07:00.461 --> 07:01.921
<i>Town's gonna know
about us soon enough,</i>

07:01.921 --> 07:03.965
<i>so we need to manage
everything just so.</i>

07:03.965 --> 07:06.342
<i>Just so.
- Hey.</i>

07:06.342 --> 07:09.095
<i>You have a scandal,
it just boosts your legend.</i>

07:09.095 --> 07:10.555
<i>But for me, it's not the same.
- Hey, honey.</i>

07:10.555 --> 07:12.765
<i>Honey, honey.</i>

07:12.765 --> 07:15.643
<i>Nobody's gonna toss you out,
right?</i>

07:15.643 --> 07:18.521
<i>You're with me now.</i>

07:18.521 --> 07:21.190
<i>Do you think it's safe to go
to your place tonight?</i>

07:21.190 --> 07:25.278
<i>My girls need a proper bed, and...</i>

07:25.278 --> 07:27.947
So does their mama.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.241
<i>My mattress is a deluxe.</i>

07:30.241 --> 07:33.494
<i>Mm, I have no doubt.</i>

07:33.494 --> 07:35.204
<i>How y'all doing tonight, huh?</i>

07:35.204 --> 07:36.622
That's good.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.749
<i>I'm feeling pretty happy
myself, thanks for asking.</i>

07:55.433 --> 07:56.809
<i>Yeah, George!

07:56.809 --> 07:58.936
<i>I'll lay around

07:58.936 --> 08:01.022
<i>Till the mail train
comes back</i>

08:01.022 --> 08:04.150
<i>Then I'll roll
in my sweet baby's arms</i>

08:04.150 --> 08:05.776
<i>Whoo! Yeah!</i>

08:05.776 --> 08:08.613
<i>I ain't gonna work
on the railroad</i>

08:08.613 --> 08:11.199
<i>You ain't gonna work at all,
if you can help it.</i>

08:11.199 --> 08:14.494
<i>I ain't gonna work
on the farm</i>

08:14.494 --> 08:16.704
<i>I'll lay around the shack</i>

08:16.704 --> 08:19.332
<i>Tammy,
your boots are so sparkly.</i>

08:19.332 --> 08:21.667
<i>Oh, yeah, he took me out
to get me a whole new wardrobe.</i>

08:21.667 --> 08:23.586
You have to tell me.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.047
<i>What's it like making love
to George Jones?</i>

08:26.047 --> 08:27.340
<i>Sheila!</i>

08:27.340 --> 08:28.799
<i>Your husband?
Right here.</i>

08:28.799 --> 08:31.219
<i>Sorry, Richey.
I know it's personal and all.</i>

08:31.219 --> 08:33.262
<i>My curiosity just ran away
with itself.</i>

08:33.262 --> 08:35.431
<i>Yeah, no.
You're embarrassing me.</i>

08:35.431 --> 08:36.724
<i>We actually--</i>

08:36.724 --> 08:38.476
<i>we haven't even done it yet.</i>

08:38.476 --> 08:41.437
<i>Nice of him to buy you
boots first. [chuckles]</i>

08:41.437 --> 08:43.189
<i>Now I know y'all have heard
a lot of chit-chat</i>

08:43.189 --> 08:45.274
<i>about this next woman
who's gonna join me on stage,</i>

08:45.274 --> 08:46.943

right, Peanutt?</i>

08:46.943 --> 08:48.110
<i>Yup.
- That's what I heard.</i>

08:48.110 --> 08:49.445
Yes, it is quite the scandal.

08:49.445 --> 08:50.821
Heard it on the radio

08:50.821 --> 08:53.533
<i>that I stole her
from behind Don Chapel's back.</i>

08:53.533 --> 08:55.493
<i>Well, I'm here to tell you
there's nothing to worry about.</i>

08:55.493 --> 08:57.203
<i>It ain't true.</i>

08:57.203 --> 08:59.789
<i>I did it
right in front of his face!</i>

08:59.789 --> 09:01.541
<i>And he ain't giving her back.</i>

09:02.875 --> 09:06.462
<i>Mama was a beauty operator</i>

09:06.462 --> 09:08.005
<i>I'm gonna get a beer.
- All right.</i>

09:08.005 --> 09:11.551
<i>Sister can sew
and can mend</i>

09:11.551 --> 09:15.888
<i>My daddy owns an interest

09:33.906 --> 09:38.160
<i>And I'll roll
in my sweet baby's arms</i>

09:38.160 --> 09:39.912
<i>Look at
how they look at them.</i>

09:39.912 --> 09:41.414
<i>George and Tammy are</i>

09:41.414 --> 09:43.040
<i>every man

09:43.040 --> 09:44.959
<i>and every woman

09:44.959 --> 09:47.545
<i>Isn't that just poetry?</i>

09:47.545 --> 09:49.630
<i>Not poetry.</i>

09:49.630 --> 09:50.798
<i>Commerce.</i>

09:53.801 --> 09:56.262
<i>And poetry too,
I suppose.</i>

10:05.271 --> 10:07.273

<i>Kid, let's us three
go for a drink.</i>

10:30.630 --> 10:33.633
<i>Mm, thanks so much, Pappy,

10:33.633 --> 10:36.427
<i>we have some stuff

10:36.427 --> 10:38.512
<i>Yeah, fun stuff.</i>

10:38.512 --> 10:40.306
<i>This is a momentous
and happy turn of events.</i>

10:40.306 --> 10:43.142
<i>You gotta let me celebrate you.
I insist.</i>

10:43.142 --> 10:44.518
<i>Well, uh,</i>

10:44.518 --> 10:46.812
<i>can we celebrate

10:46.812 --> 10:49.482
<i>The fans love

10:49.482 --> 10:50.650
<i>Makes them happy.</i>

10:50.650 --> 10:53.277
<i>We gotta get you
over to Musicor, Tam.</i>

10:53.277 --> 10:55.780
<i>Get you singing
some real country finally.</i>

10:55.780 --> 10:58.157
<i>Record some duets.
Seize this moment of love.</i>

10:58.157 --> 10:59.992
<i>Pappy, you know
she's with Billy Sherrill.</i>

10:59.992 --> 11:00.993
<i>Come on, now.</i>

11:00.993 --> 11:03.621
<i>I thought she was with you.</i>

11:03.621 --> 11:04.997
<i>You won't be thinking
about making a move</i>

11:04.997 --> 11:06.290
<i>to another label,</i>

11:06.290 --> 11:07.792
<i>'cause
the Emancipation Proclamation</i>

<i>made no provision
for hillbilly singers.</i>

11:10.002 --> 11:11.462
Mm-hmm.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.756
<i>That's right.
- Have a good night, Pappy.</i>

11:13.756 --> 11:15.007
<i>Sorry.
- Yeah.</i>

11:16.884 --> 11:18.928
<i>I'll see you soon, Pappy.</i>

11:18.928 --> 11:20.846
<i>Drive safe.
- All right.</i>

11:52.545 --> 11:54.463
It can be like this.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.074
<i>Hey.</i>

12:26.120 --> 12:28.164
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

13:07.870 --> 13:09.413
<i>when I was redecorating.</i>

13:09.413 --> 13:10.915
<i>Well, it's pe--
it's beautiful.</i>

13:10.915 --> 13:12.750
<i>Thank you.
I'm gonna get rid of all of it.</i>

13:12.750 --> 13:14.668
<i>No, you--
- Mm-hmm.</i>

13:14.668 --> 13:16.420
<i>You don't have
to get rid of it, silly.</i>

13:16.420 --> 13:19.089
<i>I'm gonna build you
a whole new house.</i>

13:19.089 --> 13:21.300
<i>You don't need to build me
a whole new house.</i>

13:25.805 --> 13:27.473
<i>Come on,
put on the Indian hair!</i>

13:27.473 --> 13:28.474
<i>The Indian hair!
We'll take</i>

13:28.474 --> 13:29.975
<i>some funny pictures.</i>

13:29.975 --> 13:31.560
I don't want to be no clown!

13:31.560 --> 13:33.395
<i>That's Anthony Quinn
right there.</i>

13:33.395 --> 13:35.648
What are you trying to pull?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.484
<i>Mm-hmm. I love him.
- Yeah.</i>

13:38.484 --> 13:40.486
<i>He's a boxer.</i>

13:40.486 --> 13:43.823
<i>Once upon a time,
he was the best at what he did.</i>

13:45.616 --> 13:49.078
<i>Went from fighting
Cassius Clay</i>

13:49.078 --> 13:52.998
<i>to being ridiculous.</i>

13:55.543 --> 13:57.503
<i>A sideshow.</i>

13:59.839 --> 14:03.342
<i>Cut up in... so many pieces,</i>

14:03.342 --> 14:06.387
<i>the man hisself's just...</i>

14:11.934 --> 14:14.603
<i>He just--he just gone.</i>

14:14.603 --> 14:15.980
<i>Hey.</i>

14:19.191 --> 14:20.860
<i>It's just a movie, baby.</i>

14:20.860 --> 14:23.195
<i>It's a true story.</i>

14:27.908 --> 14:30.703
<i>They're gonna take it from us.</i>

14:30.703 --> 14:32.037
<i>Take what, George?</i>

14:32.037 --> 14:34.373
<i>Our fire.</i>

14:34.373 --> 14:36.041
<i>No.</i>

14:53.183 --> 14:56.061
<i>George, this love
I have for you is so big.</i>

15:00.816 --> 15:04.361
<i>It scares me.</i>

15:04.361 --> 15:07.114
<i>I can leave right now
if you want me to.</i>

15:09.074 --> 15:11.410
<i>I'll just say
we were being silly, and...</i>

15:14.330 --> 15:17.166
<i>...we'll take it all back.</i>

15:17.166 --> 15:19.084
<i>But any later than right now...</i>

15:21.337 --> 15:23.255
<i>...it's gonna be forever.</i>

15:28.177 --> 15:30.095
<i>I love you.</i>

15:35.643 --> 15:39.563
<i>I love you.</i>

15:42.441 --> 15:45.444
<i>soft music</i>

15:51.784 --> 15:54.578
<i>Yeah, there you go.</i>

15:54.578 --> 15:55.788
<i>All right.</i>

16:02.086 --> 16:03.128
<i>Hi.</i>

16:06.757 --> 16:08.550


16:08.550 --> 16:09.677
<i>All right.</i>

16:24.775 --> 16:28.445
<i>Oh, I loved you
before I loved you.</i>

16:40.457 --> 16:42.751
<i>Oh, George.</i>

16:42.751 --> 16:46.338
<i>Glenn.
Call me Glenn.</i>

16:46.338 --> 16:48.048
<i>Glenn?
- Glenn.</i>

16:56.682 --> 16:58.600
<i>Hey, y'all!
- You're so lucky, Tammy.</i>

16:58.600 --> 16:59.977
<i>Oh, I'm thankful every day.</i>

16:59.977 --> 17:02.479
<i>George Jones
is the lucky one.</i>

17:02.479 --> 17:04.940
<i>Congratulations,
Mr. and Mrs. Jones.</i>

17:07.234 --> 17:11.989
<i>You stand by me</i>

17:11.989 --> 17:16.535
<i>I'll stand by you,
my darlin'</i>

17:16.535 --> 17:20.456
<i>We'll face
the world together</i>

17:20.456 --> 17:25.252
<i>It's eternity whenever</i>

17:25.252 --> 17:29.173
<i>If you stand by me</i>

17:32.468 --> 17:34.219
<i>What?</i>

17:34.219 --> 17:36.889
<i>It's working too hard.</i>

17:36.889 --> 17:39.099
<i>Hmm?
- It's a love song.</i>

17:39.099 --> 17:40.893
<i>You're putting conditions
on it,</i>

17:40.893 --> 17:42.561
<i>and there shouldn't be any.</i>

17:44.354 --> 17:47.149
<i>I met you two years ago.</i>

17:47.149 --> 17:48.901
<i>In that time,
you've charted six times,</i>

17:48.901 --> 17:52.321
<i>won a CMA,
and married George Jones.</i>

17:52.321 --> 17:54.531
<i>That's right.
- You know,</i>

17:54.531 --> 17:57.826
<i>those things
don't just happen</i>

17:57.826 --> 17:59.161
<i>to skinny girls
from Alabama</i>

17:59.161 --> 18:00.412
<i>who happen to have a catch
in their throat.</i>

18:00.412 --> 18:01.789
<i>All right, Billy.</i>

18:01.789 --> 18:03.499
<i>Sorry.</i>

18:03.499 --> 18:04.958
<i>If I told you
your next single was gonna be</i>

18:04.958 --> 18:06.960
<i>"Three Blind Mice,"
you say, "What key?"</i>

18:06.960 --> 18:08.545
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

18:09.838 --> 18:11.965
<i>What?
- Good, you're both here.</i>

18:11.965 --> 18:14.301
<i>Is George around?</i>

18:14.301 --> 18:16.220
<i>You two are not
legally married.</i>

18:16.220 --> 18:18.347
<i>Tennessee doesn't recognize
Mexican divorces.</i>

18:18.347 --> 18:19.431
<i>Liar.</i>

18:19.431 --> 18:20.891
<i>Brother Paul here's a lawyer.</i>

18:20.891 --> 18:21.975
<i>He wouldn't lie to you.</i>

18:21.975 --> 18:23.769
<i>Oh, yeah?
Well, who are you?</i>

18:23.769 --> 18:26.146
Name's George Richey.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.648
<i>But everybody calls me Richey.</i>

18:27.648 --> 18:28.982
<i>And I've been
your musical director</i>

18:28.982 --> 18:30.651
<i>over at "Hee Haw" 11 times.</i>

18:30.651 --> 18:32.027
<i>All right.</i>

18:32.027 --> 18:33.737
<i>So I'm still married
to Don?</i>

18:33.737 --> 18:36.073
<i>No, honey, I'm...
I'm your husband now.</i>

18:36.073 --> 18:37.658
<i>The marriage isn't valid.
- I'll fix it.</i>

18:37.658 --> 18:39.076
<i>No, baby,
it's not valid.</i>

18:39.076 --> 18:40.953
<i>You need a legal-minded brain
on this, Jones.</i>

18:40.953 --> 18:43.122
<i>Fixing stuff is my specialty.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

18:43.122 --> 18:44.706
<i>Well, I got a brain, okay?</i>

18:44.706 --> 18:46.542
<i>I got a real good brain.
- I know you do.</i>

18:46.542 --> 18:47.876
<i>But let's
let Billy handle this.</i>

18:47.876 --> 18:48.961
<i>Jones, this is
the kind of care</i>

18:48.961 --> 18:51.046
<i>Epic shows for our talent.</i>

18:51.046 --> 18:52.631
<i>When you're in our family,
we look out for you.</i>

18:52.631 --> 18:54.258
<i>Yeah,
I see what you're doing.</i>

18:54.258 --> 18:56.885
<i>Your love story's got
this whole town hooked.</i>

18:56.885 --> 18:59.596
<i>Everybody's talking:
DJs, fans, newspapers,</i>

18:59.596 --> 19:01.181
<i>every single promoter.</i>

19:01.181 --> 19:02.599
<i>I mean, hell, that song
you recorded at Don's</i>

19:02.599 --> 19:03.851
<i>is at number two.</i>

19:03.851 --> 19:05.185
<i>By my count,
that's the first time</i>

19:05.185 --> 19:07.396
<i>you've charted
in going on five years.</i>

19:07.396 --> 19:09.273
<i>We gotta get the two of you
in a booth,</i>

19:09.273 --> 19:11.024
<i>lay down some duets.</i>

19:11.024 --> 19:13.610
<i>Do you have
the slightest idea</i>

19:13.610 --> 19:15.946
<i>what it's gonna cost me
to get out of that contract?</i>

19:15.946 --> 19:18.532
<i>Say nothing of loyalty.</i>

19:18.532 --> 19:21.368
<i>Loyalty's a rare thing
these days.</i>

19:21.368 --> 19:24.288
<i>She left her husband
for you, Jones.</i>

19:24.288 --> 19:26.039
<i>The least you could do</i>

19:26.039 --> 19:28.292
<i>is leave your pappy for her.</i>

19:32.379 --> 19:36.633
<i>Today, I sat alone</i>

19:36.633 --> 19:39.678
<i>At the window</i>

19:41.555 --> 19:43.599
<i>And I watched</i>

19:43.599 --> 19:48.145
<i>Our little girl
outside at play</i>

19:50.731 --> 19:55.319
<i>With the little boy
next door</i>

19:55.319 --> 20:00.532
<i>Like so many times before</i>

20:00.532 --> 20:04.036
<i>But something didn't seem</i>

20:04.036 --> 20:07.456
<i>Quite right today</i>

20:07.456 --> 20:09.791
<i>When Tammy first got
to Nashville...</i>

20:09.791 --> 20:11.210
So I went outside...

20:11.210 --> 20:13.712
<i>...she knocked on
every producer's door in town.</i>

20:13.712 --> 20:15.214
What they were doing

20:15.214 --> 20:16.840
<i>Holes in her sweater</i>

20:16.840 --> 20:19.551
<i>and three little girls
in a rusty station wagon.</i>

20:19.551 --> 20:21.220
<i>Hmm.
- Planted herself</i>

20:21.220 --> 20:23.680
<i>outside my door
till I came out.</i>

20:23.680 --> 20:27.476
<i>I wasn't much in the mood
to hear another girl sing,</i>

20:27.476 --> 20:31.897
<i>let alone one named
Virginia Pugh.</i>

20:31.897 --> 20:33.774
<i>Mm.</i>

20:33.774 --> 20:36.068
<i>I guess I was kind of curt,</i>

20:36.068 --> 20:39.196
<i>'cause she started to cry.</i>

20:39.196 --> 20:40.739
<i>Said I was her last chance.</i>

20:40.739 --> 20:43.784
<i>And she told me
the producer before me</i>

20:43.784 --> 20:46.703
<i>wouldn't even agree to hear her
till she slept with him.</i>

20:46.703 --> 20:49.289
<i>Hmm.</i>

20:49.289 --> 20:50.582
<i>She wouldn't do it.</i>

20:50.582 --> 20:53.919
It can't be fun

20:53.919 --> 20:56.088
<i>That man made her
feel worthless, Jones.</i>

20:56.088 --> 20:58.257
<i>Mm.</i>

20:58.257 --> 21:00.425
<i>Yeah, I know what the men
in Nashville get up to.</i>

21:00.425 --> 21:02.344
<i>I been a culprit myself
a time or ten.</i>

21:02.344 --> 21:04.513
<i>The way it's done</i>

21:04.513 --> 21:06.431
But I'm gonna protect her.

21:06.431 --> 21:10.560
<i>I'ma build her a new life,
and no one's gonna touch her.</i>

21:10.560 --> 21:12.229
<i>She's my queen.</i>

21:12.229 --> 21:14.106
<i>Yeah.
That's admirable.</i>

21:14.106 --> 21:17.109
<i>Mm, I appreciate it.</i>

21:17.109 --> 21:20.737
<i>Nashville ain't a safe place
to be a woman.</i>

21:20.737 --> 21:22.114
<i>Way figure it.</i>

21:22.114 --> 21:23.949
<i>Not too hospitable
for the male sex neither.</i>

21:27.119 --> 21:28.453
<i>I want you
to think long and hard</i>

21:28.453 --> 21:30.706
<i>about how Pappy
has treated you,</i>

21:30.706 --> 21:32.457
<i>how he's propped you up
like a drunk fool</i>

21:32.457 --> 21:34.042
<i>and taken your money.</i>

21:34.042 --> 21:36.295
<i>You gotta ask yourself,</i>

21:36.295 --> 21:38.130
<i>are either of you
really safe there?</i>

21:38.130 --> 21:41.466
<i>And if that's
the way it's done</i>

21:41.466 --> 21:45.262
<i>I don't want to play house</i>

21:45.262 --> 21:48.974
<i>It makes my mommy cry</i>

21:51.810 --> 21:54.604
<i>'Cause
when she played house</i>

21:54.604 --> 22:01.236
<i>My daddy said goodbye</i>

22:08.410 --> 22:11.079
<i>Hmm?</i>

22:11.079 --> 22:12.622
<i>You hear that?</i>

22:14.333 --> 22:15.375
<i>What?</i>

22:17.336 --> 22:20.005
<i>Nothing.</i>

22:20.005 --> 22:22.007
<i>Just silence.</i>

22:26.053 --> 22:27.888
<i>Isn't that beautiful?</i>

22:29.848 --> 22:30.849
<i>Mm.</i>

22:32.476 --> 22:35.354
<i>slow country music</i>

22:38.106 --> 22:41.193
<i>All right.</i>

22:41.193 --> 22:43.487
<i>What else can we do?</i>

22:43.487 --> 22:44.446
<i>All right.</i>

22:44.446 --> 22:45.614
<i>You gonna count it, huh?</i>

22:45.614 --> 22:46.990
Pappy, we're ready to go.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.201
<i>Three, four.</i>

22:55.248 --> 22:59.252
<i>Beneath still waters</i>

23:01.088 --> 23:03.256
<i>There's a strong undertow</i>

23:06.927 --> 23:11.473
<i>The surface won't tell you</i>

23:12.724 --> 23:16.770
<i>What the deep water knows</i>

23:18.897 --> 23:22.567
<i>Darlin', I'm saying</i>

23:24.611 --> 23:29.366
<i>I know something's wrong</i>

23:30.450 --> 23:36.206
<i>Beneath still waters</i>

23:36.206 --> 23:37.874
<i>Your love is gone</i>

23:37.874 --> 23:40.502
<i>Where'd you get
the new wheels?</i>

23:40.502 --> 23:42.421
<i>He buy that for you?</i>

23:42.421 --> 23:46.258
Even a fool can see

23:47.926 --> 23:52.264
<i>That you'll soon
be leaving me</i>

23:52.264 --> 23:53.932
<i>What do you want?</i>

23:53.932 --> 23:55.934
<i>I got a new song
I want to pitch to George.</i>

23:55.934 --> 23:58.395
<i>Ugh.</i>

23:58.395 --> 24:00.897
<i>All about a cheatin' wife</i>

24:00.897 --> 24:03.275
<i>who passed around
nudie pictures of herself.</i>

24:03.275 --> 24:05.318
<i>You think something
like that'd be a hit?</i>

24:05.318 --> 24:07.320
<i>No.</i>

24:07.320 --> 24:10.532
<i>Don, I gave you a house,
this godforsaken car.</i>

24:10.532 --> 24:11.867
<i>I gave you everything</i>

24:11.867 --> 24:13.201
<i>that was sitting
in the bank account.</i>

24:13.201 --> 24:14.494
<i>I got nothing left
to give you.</i>

24:14.494 --> 24:16.955
<i>You got you.</i>

24:16.955 --> 24:19.166
<i>Donna and I tried to play
some of our bookings,</i>

24:19.166 --> 24:21.751
<i>but nobody wants our act
without you.</i>

24:21.751 --> 24:24.171
<i>No.</i>

24:24.171 --> 24:26.590
<i>I can't.</i>

24:26.590 --> 24:29.384
<i>George sees those
pictures, he'll leave you.</i>

24:29.384 --> 24:31.428
<i>Then if the world sees,</i>

24:31.428 --> 24:33.305
<i>I can't even imagine
what that would do</i>

24:33.305 --> 24:34.639
<i>to your career.</i>

24:34.639 --> 24:35.974
<i>The state might even
declare you</i>

24:35.974 --> 24:38.268
<i>an unfit parent...</i>

24:38.268 --> 24:39.478
<i>again.</i>

24:42.272 --> 24:44.232
<i>But each...</i>

24:44.232 --> 24:46.359
<i>You've had your shortcomings, but...</i>

24:48.653 --> 24:51.072
<i>...I've never known you
to be a bad man.</i>

24:51.072 --> 24:53.492
<i>And I never knew you
to be a lying whore.</i>

24:55.160 --> 24:57.037
<i>But fair is fair.</i>

24:59.706 --> 25:01.374
<i>You can keep those,
by the way.</i>

25:01.374 --> 25:03.752
<i>Those is just copies.</i>

25:03.752 --> 25:06.463
<i>Now get out of my car.</i>

25:07.964 --> 25:11.051
<i>You've got
a little scar back here.</i>

25:11.051 --> 25:12.552
<i>I never noticed it before.</i>

25:12.552 --> 25:14.596
<i>Mm.</i>

25:14.596 --> 25:18.099
<i>There's stuff about me,
if you knew,</i>

25:18.099 --> 25:19.434
<i>you'd stop loving me.</i>

25:19.434 --> 25:20.560
<i>Never.</i>

25:20.560 --> 25:22.312
<i>Mm-hmm.
- Mm-mm.</i>

25:25.398 --> 25:27.776
<i>Let's get away from here.</i>

25:27.776 --> 25:29.653
<i>Make a fresh start
and go someplace</i>

25:47.963 --> 25:49.214
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:51.925 --> 25:54.844
<i>It's a much better deal

25:54.844 --> 25:56.888
<i>I don't see
why that would hurt your heart.</i>

26:08.358 --> 26:11.695

26:19.035 --> 26:20.370
<i>He'll kill Don.</i>

26:21.830 --> 26:23.081
<i>and not divorced
from a dead guy.</i>

26:23.081 --> 26:24.666
<i>Yeah, and I'll be alone.</i>

26:24.666 --> 26:25.667
<i>Well, what are we
talking about here, honey?</i>

26:25.667 --> 26:27.419
<i>A couple of nudies?</i>

26:27.419 --> 26:28.795
<i>Even I have those.</i>

<i>No, sugar,
it's all right.</i>

26:40.515 --> 26:45.353
<i>you know, George told me
just to forget everything.</i>

26:45.353 --> 26:47.564

26:47.564 --> 26:49.107
<i>Oh, yeah?
- You didn't hear it from me,</i>

26:49.107 --> 26:50.942

real intimidating.</i>

26:50.942 --> 26:53.236
<i>It's a comfort.</i>

26:53.236 --> 26:54.779
<i>Shh, shh.</i>

26:54.779 --> 26:57.240

<i>Well, is it done?</i>

27:01.411 --> 27:03.371
<i>I'm all yours.</i>

27:05.707 --> 27:07.292
<i>And we don't believe you</i>

<i>Close every window</i>

27:33.985 --> 27:38.114
<i>And bolt every door</i>

27:43.286 --> 27:47.123

<i>To your most barren desert</i>

<i>A thousand miles</i>

28:01.680 --> 28:04.766
<i>From the nearest sea</i>

28:08.228 --> 28:11.272
<i>The very moment</i>

28:11.272 --> 28:13.650
<i>I saw your smile</i>

28:13.650 --> 28:19.489
<i>It would be
like heaven to me</i>

28:21.366 --> 28:24.619
There's not any mountain

28:24.619 --> 28:28.164
<i>Too rugged to climb</i>

28:28.164 --> 28:29.874
<i>No desert</i>

28:29.874 --> 28:35.588
<i>Too barren to cross</i>

just show a sign</i>

28:42.429 --> 28:43.596
<i>Of love</i>

28:43.596 --> 28:49.394
<i>I could bear any loss</i>

<i>And the coldest weather</i>

28:58.695 --> 29:01.531
<i>Of the wintertime</i>

29:03.616 --> 29:05.410
<i>And it would be</i>

29:05.410 --> 29:10.790
<i>Just like spring
in California</i>

29:10.790 --> 29:16.212
<i>As long as I knew
you were mine</i>

29:17.964 --> 29:19.507
<i>Yes, it would be</i>

<i>Honey,
I'm worried about Don.</i>

29:46.451 --> 29:48.369
<i>He's holding up the divorce.</i>

29:48.369 --> 29:50.705
<i>Well, let the lawyer handle it.</i>

29:50.705 --> 29:52.540
<i>Right?
- Yeah, but he's angry,</i>

29:52.540 --> 29:54.918
<i>and I'm afraid
of what he might do.</i>

29:58.463 --> 30:01.090
<i>I was thinking
that if we recorded</i>

30:01.090 --> 30:02.801
<i>a few of his songs
for our album,</i>

30:02.801 --> 30:05.637

of some of his bitterness.</i>

30:06.805 --> 30:07.847
<i>No.</i>

30:09.349 --> 30:11.684
<i>Here, you come with me.</i>

30:18.358 --> 30:19.567
<i>We give him a couple of hits,</i>

30:19.567 --> 30:21.152
<i>that's real money
in his pocket.</i>
