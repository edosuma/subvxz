WEBVTT

03:20.450 --> 03:22.661
- Morning, Mia.
- Good morning, Rena.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.544
<i>Well, well, well, America,</i>

03:30.544 --> 03:33.755
<i>it's been a wild two weeks
for our friends at UBA.</i>

03:33.755 --> 03:36.550
<i>Thousands of hacked emails.
It's like Christmas everyday.</i>

03:36.550 --> 03:40.971
<i>I don't know about you,
but I live to search ubaleaks.com</i>

03:40.971 --> 03:44.016
<i>for my daily drip-drop of
their embarrassments.</i>

03:47.227 --> 03:52.316
This is one day's worth of our liabilities
for the hack? It looks like <i>War and Peace</i>.

03:52.316 --> 03:55.694
Page 85 of the unreleased emails.

04:07.206 --> 04:10.792
Well, Earl. You spoil me.

04:10.792 --> 04:15.130
Just call me Tolstoy.
Let me know what you wanna do with that.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.685
<i>You're welcome, Cory.</i>

04:28.685 --> 04:29.770
<i>For what?</i>

04:30.312 --> 04:31.396
Boosting your stock price.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.857
That tends to happen with companies
I'm rumored to be acquiring.

04:33.857 --> 04:36.276
<i>Well, I'd say it's more than a rumor.</i>

04:37.402 --> 04:39.613
- That's news.
- Well, here's more news.

04:41.073 --> 04:44.910
Your original offer works for me.
At the price you first pitched.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.370
<i>Let's get this done.</i>

04:48.205 --> 04:50.207
- What about your board?
- Leave that to me.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.177
Pull the trigger.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.061
- Guys, we gotta-- We gotta-- I'm sorry.
- Oh!

05:11.061 --> 05:12.396
We gotta rethink these selfies.

05:12.396 --> 05:15.148
Look at-- I don't care what app
you're on. You're on Tinder,

05:15.148 --> 05:18.026
420 Singles, Kingsnake After Dark.
We can't be doing this.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.571
- Angles, people. This, really?
- Yes. Come on.

05:20.571 --> 05:23.615
- No one's hot for your under chin.
- And why do guys think this works?

05:23.615 --> 05:25.576
- I don't understand why they--
- I have no idea.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.619
Well, Chris how--
how did your husband break through?

05:28.287 --> 05:30.455
Not on an app,
but you know, it's a long story.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.541
Oh, please, highlights.
Give us the highlights.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.625
You got a minute.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.337
<i>Oh, okay. For you.</i>

05:37.337 --> 05:38.797
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>8:55 version.</i>

05:38.797 --> 05:42.050
I'm at my first Olympic trials,
and there's a guy.

05:42.050 --> 05:45.637
He's cute, and he has these eyes.
And I'm like, "Don't look at me like that,

05:45.637 --> 05:46.805
you're making me nervous."

05:46.805 --> 05:50.058
Anyway. He reps my nemesis,
who's competing with me for Nike.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.143
Oh, wow.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.520
And they only wanna sign
one American in track and field.

05:53.520 --> 05:57.608
So, I'm in my hotel room,
and I get a surprise delivery.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.736
Tiffany blue dunks in my size.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.070
- Those are sneakers.
- Gosh.

06:02.070 --> 06:06.658
And there's a note with Marcus's number,
and it just says, "You're it."

06:06.658 --> 06:07.868
Oh, wow.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.578
- What can I say, the man can close.
- And--

06:09.578 --> 06:11.455
- That's ex-- So impressive.
- Yeah. Yeah. Or--

06:11.455 --> 06:12.748
Or he's just looking to connect.

06:12.748 --> 06:16.376
And now it's time to connect you
to <i>The Twist</i> right after this break.

06:17.920 --> 06:18.921
And we're clear.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.422
Cut to commercial.

06:21.632 --> 06:22.674
Great show, everybody.

06:22.674 --> 06:23.634
Connect?

06:23.634 --> 06:25.969
- Connect, connect.
- I know you mean, like, as people.

06:25.969 --> 06:28.138
- You know-- Exactly. Nice segue.
- I do. That's very sweet.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.182
- We did that.
- Moving to <i>The Twist</i> package.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.266
- Oh, God.
- Here you go.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.935
- Thank you, dear.
- You were right.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.895
Those dating pics were tragic.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.230
I know.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.649
Not everybody can find love
in their boss's apartment.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.488
I like that smile.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.823
We just gained another 30,000 on <i>YDA</i>.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.494
Shut up. Who knew getting hacked
would put us back on top?

06:51.078 --> 06:53.497
Hey, Layla. Post these numbers
at the next segment meeting.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.290
We could all use the morale boost.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.961
- Layla, can you hear me?
- Look at <i>Eagle News</i>.

06:58.961 --> 07:02.756
<i>...missteps of a top talent at UBA,
when the real drama</i>

07:02.756 --> 07:04.925
- <i>is from their hate speech.</i>
- Turn that up.

07:04.925 --> 07:09.054
<i>And the struggle for racial equality
at UBA just took another step back.</i>

07:09.680 --> 07:13.600
<i>We've just received a cache of emails
and found a doozy.</i>

07:14.810 --> 07:19.690
<i>Cybil Reynolds, legend of the industry
and UBA board president,</i>

07:19.690 --> 07:22.776
<i>referred to</i> The Morning Show
<i>co-anchor, Christina Hunter,</i>

07:22.776 --> 07:27.406
<i>as Aunt Jemima in an email
about her hiring.</i>

07:27.406 --> 07:32.661
<i>Yeah, you heard that right. Aunt Jemima.</i>

07:35.914 --> 07:37.040
Kyle, get me legal.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.418
Call Leonard and set up a dinner
for us tomorrow night,

07:40.627 --> 07:42.004
and then get me Chris.

08:57.663 --> 08:58.664
Hello?

09:04.795 --> 09:05.921
I found the email.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.676
Cybil's talking to the rest of the board
about Q3 financials in 2020,

09:10.676 --> 09:14.346
and she's pissed that UBA spent so much
money on a two-year deal with Chris.

09:14.346 --> 09:18.392
Somebody points out that Chris
would still be making less than Bradley

09:18.392 --> 09:20.644
when she was hired.
"We got her at a steal.

09:20.644 --> 09:24.439
After all, Chris is popular enough
to be on cereal boxes."

09:24.439 --> 09:26.859
- I don't see what's so bad.
- It's in Cybil's reply. She wrote back,

09:26.859 --> 09:30.070
"Aunt Jemima was on cereal boxes too

09:30.070 --> 09:32.197
and no one's buying her anymore."

09:32.197 --> 09:36.285
- Mia--
- Buying her? What is wrong with Cybil?

09:39.162 --> 09:42.124
- Did Chris leave yet?
- Cory called her to his office.

09:57.806 --> 09:58.932
You can go on in.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.189
Chris. Hi.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.234
Never been up to this floor. It's classy.

10:09.234 --> 10:13.739
Yeah. Right? The decor. Top-notch.

10:13.739 --> 10:15.699
- You want a painting?
- What?

10:18.160 --> 10:20.662
Oh, God. Stupid joke.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.709
- Sorry. How are you?
- I'm still catching my breath.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.754
Yeah. Listen, I know you don't know Cybil,

10:28.754 --> 10:31.381
but she has been a fixture here
for a long time.

10:31.381 --> 10:34.718
But in any house, fixtures need replacing.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.386
I see.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.014
You don't want me to sue.

10:39.014 --> 10:41.183
Of course, we don't want it
to get to that point.

10:41.183 --> 10:43.519
My team's already working on how
to make it right with you.

10:43.519 --> 10:45.812
Favored nations with Bradley, of course.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.315
A bonus in recognition of
your terrific work.

10:49.566 --> 10:53.570
But I would love to keep this in-house.

10:54.696 --> 11:00.035
We should do the news,
not be the news. Right?

11:04.748 --> 11:06.542
We'll get back to you
by the end of the day.

11:08.210 --> 11:13.006
Thank you for stopping by.
I wanted you to know how valued you are.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.051
And I think I'm learning how much.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.313
You're hiding.

12:11.023 --> 12:12.107
Thanks for meeting me.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.902
Yeah. We'll have to make this quick.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.196
Gotta get back to my full-time job
at the teacup.

12:17.196 --> 12:20.657
Thank you for honoring your commitments.

12:20.657 --> 12:21.783
Of course.

12:23.202 --> 12:26.747
I'm wondering about how people
are reacting around the building.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.541
You mean what Cory's doing?

12:30.292 --> 12:31.710
Well, if I had to guess I assume

12:31.710 --> 12:33.545
he's having his lawyers
draw up a statement.

12:33.545 --> 12:37.424
Yeah, I figured as much. So, just--
You haven't heard anything else?

12:39.009 --> 12:41.136
I'm not a spy, Cybil.

12:41.136 --> 12:44.264
I don't need a spy, Alex.
I need an advocate.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.226
I don't know what to tell you.
It's all right there in black-and-white.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.478
Yes, I know how it looks.

12:49.478 --> 12:53.065
I asked you here so we could figure out
the fastest way out of this.

12:53.065 --> 12:54.274
I'm sorry. We?

12:54.983 --> 13:00.280
Well, what if you interviewed me
on <i>Alex Unfiltered</i>?

13:01.532 --> 13:04.076
Wow. Why?

13:04.076 --> 13:06.787
I would like to speak on my own behalf.

13:06.787 --> 13:11.124
I just don't think that going on
television right now is the thing to do.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.377
Are you telling me I need media training

13:13.377 --> 13:15.963
after 45 years at the network
my grandfather founded?

13:15.963 --> 13:18.549
I never said that. I'm just saying this
is a lot trickier

13:18.549 --> 13:21.301
than talking about UBA's stock price.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.428
I was thrilled when we hired Chris.

13:23.428 --> 13:27.349
Yes, she was inexperienced,
but it was the right thing to do.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.853
This is ridiculous.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.479
It's a complete misunderstanding.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.439
Yeah, well,
whether it's a misunderstanding or not,

13:34.439 --> 13:37.985
I just--
I don't want any part of it. I just don't.

13:37.985 --> 13:41.905
You? Of all people.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.535
What is that supposed to mean?

13:49.705 --> 13:51.665
You know they all wanted you gone.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.170
Cory, Fred. All of them.

13:56.670 --> 14:00.215
I had your back,
because I know what it's like

14:00.215 --> 14:03.093
when a bunch of men
decide a woman's sell-by date.

14:03.093 --> 14:06.972
I had your back,
and now you need to have mine.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.017
If I go down for this,

14:10.934 --> 14:15.898
do you think whoever replaces me
is going to care about you

14:17.024 --> 14:19.193
or what you want?

14:19.193 --> 14:24.114
Let's face it.
It'll be Cory or one of his toadies.

14:24.740 --> 14:28.285
And how has Cory
looked out for you so far?

14:28.285 --> 14:29.786
Yes. I know, Cybil.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.122
I have actually felt your support
over the years.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.960
It's funny how now all of a sudden
it becomes about sisterhood

14:36.960 --> 14:40.672
and solidarity,
because now you need something.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.549
Alex, this is how the world works.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.759
- Wow.
- You know that.

14:43.759 --> 14:46.595
I have no angle here.

14:46.595 --> 14:50.933
I just want a chance
to set the goddamn record straight.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.812
I've given my life to this place.

14:57.314 --> 15:00.025
I won't be canceled over this.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.154
It happens to the best of us.

15:39.523 --> 15:43.360
You only breathe like that
when you're anxious.

15:45.571 --> 15:48.949
Babe, it's gonna blow over, I promise.

15:50.242 --> 15:51.827
But you gotta get your sleep.

15:52.536 --> 15:55.622
3:30 is right around the corner.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.050
Look, it's Cybil's family's company.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.845
You can understand why she'd try to,
like, use us to bail her out.

16:09.845 --> 16:14.975
Come on. UBA's been
a publicly traded company for decades.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.435
We don't belong to her.

16:16.435 --> 16:19.438
Besides, everything on TV,
it gets canceled sooner or later.

16:19.438 --> 16:21.481
I don't know why Cybil
should be any different.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.983
She's not gonna stay quiet.

16:22.983 --> 16:26.987
Well, let her get loud.
That doesn't mean we have to

16:26.987 --> 16:29.990
put a resident daughter of
the confederacy on <i>Alex Unfiltered</i>.

16:29.990 --> 16:34.077
Cory, trust me.
I am not crazy about this idea at all,

16:34.077 --> 16:38.415
but that tired statement from the suits,
that just makes us look worse.

16:38.415 --> 16:42.085
Cybil has an NDA. She's not gonna
be able to tell her story to anyone,

16:42.085 --> 16:44.963
and this has to be addressed
and we're the only ones who can do it.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.382
- Period.
- Okay. How's Chris doing?

16:47.382 --> 16:50.344
She seemed fine at the show today,
but I can't imagine she is.

16:50.344 --> 16:53.305
I mean, from what I could see,
she was a total pro.

16:53.305 --> 16:56.266
Yeah. She was great.
She came in, she did her job.

16:56.266 --> 16:59.144
She didn't wanna talk about it,
which I completely understand,

16:59.144 --> 17:00.896
because it's our mess to clean up.

17:00.896 --> 17:03.398
- It's not her mess.
- The mess is already cleaned up.

17:03.398 --> 17:06.568
We issued a statement. I'm not sure
why you guys wanna chum the waters.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.154
I'm not excusing what Cybil did,
but I understand the ask.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.781
Sounds like she wants a chance
to defend her reputation.

17:11.781 --> 17:16.161
What about UBA's reputation?
Let her go on <i>Eagle News</i>.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.372
I don't care about the NDA. I'll waive it.

17:18.372 --> 17:24.377
This is not gossip. This is newsworthy,
and everybody is talking about it.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.046
If we ignore it, how do we look?

17:26.672 --> 17:29.925
Also, Cory, isn't this, like, your thing?

17:29.925 --> 17:32.177
Like, the ratings, the whole circus?

17:32.177 --> 17:34.721
I don't like being leveraged
by someone who I know

17:34.721 --> 17:36.890
is gonna be playing shuffleboard
in Boca in a week.

17:36.890 --> 17:40.477
She is a dead man walking.
Her own board won't even talk to her.

17:46.692 --> 17:49.069
Sorry, Cory,
but there is a solid argument here.

17:49.653 --> 17:52.698
An interview on <i>Alex Unfiltered</i> would
show that we're taking this seriously.

17:52.698 --> 17:55.576
And given how UBA covered up
Mitch Kessler's behavior,

17:55.576 --> 17:57.995
not to mention the racial issues
around that behavior,

17:57.995 --> 18:00.372
our best move is
to get ahead of this ourselves.

18:09.006 --> 18:11.884
Fine, but I'd like to see first cut.

18:11.884 --> 18:15.470
And if it's a circle jerk,
we're not airing it.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.473
Circle jerk? Ex-- What?

18:18.473 --> 18:21.018
Is it just me, or is he in a hurry
to bury the body?

18:30.027 --> 18:31.028
The fuck?

18:31.820 --> 18:32.821
Rena, come here.

18:36.116 --> 18:39.119
- What am I looking at?
- Salaries from the hack website.

18:39.119 --> 18:44.041
It's not just Chris being lowballed,
it's all of us. Well, maybe not all of us.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.418
So, you're saying it's a pattern.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.629
Wait, what? Seriously?

18:48.629 --> 18:51.548
I've been digging through the data dump
from the hack. It ain't pretty.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.175
- Oh, my God.
- This is crazy.

18:53.675 --> 18:56.929
All the junior staff have had racist shit
said and done to us forever,

18:56.929 --> 18:58.555
but now everybody cares
because it's Chris?

18:58.555 --> 18:59.765
This is bullshit.

18:59.765 --> 19:02.059
I swear to God,
what's the point of even working here?

19:02.059 --> 19:06.605
Layla, can we review copy
for tomorrow in my office?

19:09.650 --> 19:10.776
I'm gonna...

19:18.742 --> 19:20.202
Here's a copy for tomorrow.

19:22.621 --> 19:23.622
Forget the copy.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.503
What's going on, Layla? Help me out.

19:32.089 --> 19:34.758
First those god-awful performance reviews,
and now this?

19:35.467 --> 19:37.803
It took the leak of an email
about a famous person,

19:37.803 --> 19:39.721
a rich and famous person,

19:39.721 --> 19:43.267
to make anyone care about the inequality
that's baked into this place.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.853
- And we're pissed.
- How pissed?

19:47.229 --> 19:48.814
You might not have a staff by tomorrow.

19:52.526 --> 19:54.403
Okay. Thank you for your honesty.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.239
I appreciate it.

20:07.749 --> 20:11.336
Hey, Stella, we need an all-hands.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.381
All right, everybody.
Thank you for coming.

20:16.717 --> 20:20.888
We know that Cybil Reynolds' email,
and some unfortunate pay inequities

20:20.888 --> 20:23.140
have made a lot of you upset,
and rightfully so.

20:23.932 --> 20:26.101
We've all been through a lot.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.729
We just wanted to get everybody together
and talk about it.

20:28.729 --> 20:33.233
Talk about what <i>The Morning Show</i>
can do to make things right. Anybody?

20:36.028 --> 20:37.613
They're all looking at me, aren't they?

20:37.613 --> 20:39.823
Well, they're not not looking at you.

20:39.823 --> 20:44.369
Yeah, so anyone, anyone can talk.
Talk about how you feel.

20:46.121 --> 20:48.165
- You're free to say anything...
- That's right.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.333
...without fear of reprisal.

20:49.333 --> 20:53.712
- Management will not retaliate, okay?
- Right, this is a completely safe space.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.214
All right, fuck it.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.425
Of course,
you can't fire us for speaking out.

20:58.425 --> 20:59.635
But you know what you can do?

21:00.260 --> 21:03.514
Ice us out of assignments,
pass us over for promotions,

21:03.514 --> 21:07.851
make it so unpleasant that we'll quit
on our own. That way you stay clean.

21:07.851 --> 21:10.687
Okay, Layla, I am not going
to let that happen to you.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.023
But where's Cory? Where's Cybil?

21:14.775 --> 21:17.110
They're not here
because they don't have to be here.

21:18.237 --> 21:21.657
Look, they're betting that we're either
going to just shut the fuck up

21:21.657 --> 21:24.451
and, you know, remain in our place.

21:25.244 --> 21:28.330
All the talent that comes in here
who's Black and vocal,

21:29.289 --> 21:32.626
they either quiet down or they leave.

21:32.626 --> 21:35.420
Julia, remember our place?

21:35.420 --> 21:37.214
Really? You're amazing at what you do.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.800
Why would you play
into the hands of people

21:39.800 --> 21:41.635
who want you to see yourself as a victim?

21:41.635 --> 21:43.887
I mean, you don't see
how disempowering that is?

21:43.887 --> 21:45.681
I don't think I was doing that, Yanko.

21:45.681 --> 21:48.100
All right, look. Guys, bottom line, race--

21:48.100 --> 21:49.726
First of all, it's a fiction, okay?

21:49.726 --> 21:51.895
And it's being weaponized, okay?
We all know that.

21:51.895 --> 21:56.483
Do we? Do we all know that? I'm not sure...

21:56.483 --> 21:58.277
We're having the wrong conversation, okay?

21:58.277 --> 22:00.112
- Well, we're--
- Can I speak now?

22:00.112 --> 22:02.531
- I mean, is it safe?
- Go ahead. Yeah.

22:02.531 --> 22:04.658
All we're doing, Mia, right now
is checking boxes.

22:04.658 --> 22:07.119
We're checking boxes,
we're scoring diversity points

22:07.119 --> 22:10.038
on some spreadsheet, for what?
So that we can all feel better?

22:10.038 --> 22:12.165
I mean, the thing that
we were railing against,

22:12.165 --> 22:14.126
adjudicating on the basis of skin color--

22:14.126 --> 22:18.046
I mean, and if that thing alone
isn't screwed up on so many levels,

22:18.046 --> 22:21.592
then we're also being forced to choose
one racial identity when we're all mutts.

22:21.592 --> 22:26.013
Look at me. No, I mean, I pass
for Sephardic Jew, I pass for Persian,

22:26.013 --> 22:27.347
I pass for Armenian.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.308
But because both my parents,
they're from Cuba,

22:29.308 --> 22:31.518
you're gonna tell me now
that I'm just brown?

22:31.518 --> 22:35.272
- Yanko, aren't you third-generation Cuban?
- Yes, but you're missing the point.

22:35.272 --> 22:36.648
No-- Laugh all you want.

22:36.648 --> 22:39.151
It's true. You're right, it's funny, but--
I'll get you a better example.

22:39.151 --> 22:40.152
- Alex.
- What?

22:40.152 --> 22:42.112
No, let's say that,
that you spit in a tube,

22:42.112 --> 22:44.406
and you find out
that your great-grandfather is Black.

22:44.406 --> 22:46.617
Okay,
would that all of a sudden make you Black?

22:46.617 --> 22:47.659
He's got a point.

22:47.659 --> 22:48.869
Oh, my God.

22:52.664 --> 22:54.666
If you were to send your DNA
to one of those places,

22:54.666 --> 22:57.711
and you find out today
that great-grandfather's Black,

22:57.711 --> 23:00.506
all of a sudden, Alex Levy, she's Black?
Is she Black?

23:00.506 --> 23:02.341
Yanko, you're turning this into a stunt.

23:02.341 --> 23:05.010
I'm pointing out the absurdity of this.
You don't see that?

23:05.010 --> 23:07.554
- Come on. You know it's not helping.
- What? No.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.889
- At all.
- It's the wokeness.

23:08.889 --> 23:09.932
That's what's not helping, Alex.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.602
Would you do--
Take this over, and I'll be right back.

23:13.602 --> 23:15.187
- I'm worrying--
- Yeah. Keep talking.

23:15.187 --> 23:17.898
We're getting ourselves derailed here.

23:17.898 --> 23:20.442
We are all well-meaning and...

23:20.442 --> 23:22.194
Chris, wait.

23:24.071 --> 23:25.572
What was the point of that back there?

23:26.698 --> 23:29.159
I thought it would help
to talk it out in the open.

23:29.159 --> 23:31.578
Before you put Cybil on <i>Alex Unfiltered</i>?

23:32.746 --> 23:35.040
Show what a friend she is to brown people?

23:35.040 --> 23:36.667
That decision's above my pay grade.

23:36.667 --> 23:39.419
Sounds like we both
need higher pay grades then.

23:39.419 --> 23:40.629
Yeah.

23:42.965 --> 23:46.468
Don't let Cybil
or this whole corporate machine

23:46.468 --> 23:48.136
make you doubt your worth.

23:48.136 --> 23:50.556
I never doubted my worth.
I just didn't know other people did.

23:52.474 --> 23:53.642
I'm not one of those people.

23:53.642 --> 23:56.228
Then why haven't you found me
a new anchor producer?

23:57.187 --> 23:59.106
It's been hard
to attract high-level producers.

23:59.106 --> 24:00.482
I can't imagine why.

24:14.121 --> 24:17.708
- What happened to the meeting?
- I ended it. We weren't getting anywhere.

24:19.543 --> 24:20.377
How's Chris?

24:20.377 --> 24:22.129
How would you be
if you were her right now?

24:22.129 --> 24:24.965
Yeah, we're gonna have a lot of
shitty days until this goes away.

24:24.965 --> 24:26.925
Will it, though? Go away?

24:28.760 --> 24:30.846
Wringing our hands
over one email from Cybil

24:30.846 --> 24:32.973
is like trying to put
a Band-Aid on cancer.

24:33.682 --> 24:36.101
And, Stella, by the way,
it was our fucking job to know

24:36.101 --> 24:38.812
that Chris and a hundred other people
were being lowballed

24:38.812 --> 24:40.189
in the name of budget cuts.

24:40.939 --> 24:44.193
And I'm the one who has to look at Julia
and Layla and everybody else

24:44.193 --> 24:48.113
who's overworked, underappreciated,
underpaid on my watch.

24:48.113 --> 24:50.282
But yeah.
No, don't look over there, you know?

24:50.282 --> 24:53.952
Keep the show lean and mean.
Do more with less. Get creative.

24:53.952 --> 24:55.287
Win the fucking ratings war.

24:55.287 --> 24:57.289
Sleep in your office,
if that's what it takes.

24:57.289 --> 25:00.834
'Cause that is what it takes
to keep the lights on during a pandemic.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.879
To literally keep the lights on
during a hack.

25:03.879 --> 25:06.215
How fucked up is it, Stella,

25:06.215 --> 25:10.219
that I'm supposed to be running
the machine, and I am a goddamn cog?

25:11.428 --> 25:14.556
Maybe UBA is a plantation,
just with dental insurance.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.769
- Yeah, you're right.
- I know I'm right.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.022
But what does that say about me,
that I'm still here?

25:22.022 --> 25:26.360
We're getting out of here.
We're getting drunk tonight.

25:27.486 --> 25:31.156
- Stella, no. I don't have time.
- Do not make me pull rank.

25:31.156 --> 25:32.324
That's an order.

25:32.324 --> 25:33.575
We're getting out of here,

25:33.575 --> 25:36.745
and we're drinking
until we can't see straight.

25:36.745 --> 25:41.458
And I'm expensing all of it,
and we're inviting Chris.

25:43.460 --> 25:45.212
- Now tell me, what color is it?
- Red.

25:45.963 --> 25:48.215
Red. Good job, Naima.

25:48.215 --> 25:52.261
Here, here. There you-- Hey!
What color is this?

25:52.261 --> 25:55.973
- Orange.
- Orange! So amazing.

25:58.684 --> 25:59.852
You know what's next, huh?

25:59.852 --> 26:01.895
You getting ahead of me, huh?

26:01.895 --> 26:05.065
Oh, wow. Look at this. Green.

26:05.065 --> 26:08.235
What's that? Hey! High-five, high-five.

26:10.195 --> 26:11.947
Okay, you're being ridiculous.
Get off the floor.

26:14.074 --> 26:15.659
"How has your week been, honey?"

26:15.659 --> 26:18.871
"Well, I had to read
a racist email about me,

26:18.871 --> 26:21.832
sent by someone I met exactly once.

26:21.832 --> 26:24.710
Then our CEO offered me ho money

26:24.710 --> 26:26.503
- to stay quiet.
- Stop.

26:26.503 --> 26:29.673
And some reporter asked me
what I was gonna do about all of this.

26:29.673 --> 26:33.969
And then my Black boss told me
that I should keep calm and carry on."

26:35.012 --> 26:36.388
So you wanna quit?

26:38.307 --> 26:39.725
You know I don't quit anything.

26:39.725 --> 26:42.144
I mean, you've put in enough time.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.813
<i>The Morning Show</i>
wasn't supposed to be forever.

26:44.813 --> 26:46.273
Come here, come here.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.359
You know, we were fine.

26:49.860 --> 26:52.029
We had enough in endorsements
to tide us over,

26:52.029 --> 26:56.658
- and I let you talk me into this job.
- I didn't talk you into this.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.744
I told you I felt like
they were lowballing me,

26:58.744 --> 27:01.205
- and you said we shouldn't push it.
- No, no, no, no,

27:01.205 --> 27:02.623
I'm not gonna let you blame me for this

27:02.623 --> 27:04.416
because these white folks
have lost their minds.

27:04.416 --> 27:06.001
We should've taken them
for every dime they had.

27:06.001 --> 27:07.878
- And now we can.
- No.

27:07.878 --> 27:10.964
You sue once,
you are forever the woman who sues.

27:12.090 --> 27:13.342
Yeah?

27:19.848 --> 27:20.933
I'm sorry.

27:20.933 --> 27:23.060
- If that's a reporter--
- I'll handle it.

27:27.022 --> 27:28.190
It's Alex.

27:28.190 --> 27:30.484
Yeah, okay. Mommy will be right back.

27:32.152 --> 27:33.529
This better not take long.

27:37.074 --> 27:38.367
I'll take care of her, baby.

27:41.370 --> 27:42.579
- Alex.
- Hi.

27:43.121 --> 27:46.124
I'm sorry to drop by unannounced.

27:46.124 --> 27:47.417
I actually did try to announce,

27:47.417 --> 27:50.170
but you weren't picking up your phone
or answering your texts.

27:51.380 --> 27:53.048
- It's fine. Come in.
- Great.

27:54.466 --> 27:55.467
Hey, Marcus.

27:55.968 --> 27:57.469
Hey, Alex. Good to see you.

28:16.697 --> 28:19.533
Veal marsala, amazing.

28:20.242 --> 28:21.785
I do feel bad for the baby cows,

28:21.785 --> 28:23.745
spending their all-too-short lives
caged up,

28:23.745 --> 28:25.539
never knowing the hellscape
that awaits them.

28:25.539 --> 28:27.249
It tugs at the heartstrings, really,

28:27.249 --> 28:32.421
but here, the veal marsala,
it tests the limits of my sympathy.

28:32.421 --> 28:35.799
Let's cut the shit, Cory.
Why am I so far uptown?

28:35.799 --> 28:39.178
Leonard, you know there's
a world beyond the Upper East Side.

28:39.678 --> 28:42.973
Yes, which is why I live on
the Upper East Side.

28:44.183 --> 28:45.934
We needed a little privacy,

28:45.934 --> 28:49.563
away from prying eyes
and the hot takes of reporters.

28:49.563 --> 28:53.942
So, what's the board thinking
about Paul's offer,

28:53.942 --> 28:56.612
now that Cybil's email has been leaked?

28:57.404 --> 28:58.822
We're over the moon.

28:58.822 --> 29:02.993
I mean, racial scandals.
Great for business.

29:02.993 --> 29:04.077
Point taken.

29:05.245 --> 29:07.122
Let's dispense with pleasantries.

29:07.789 --> 29:10.709
I opposed your appointment as CEO.

29:10.709 --> 29:13.378
Since then, you've had some wins.

29:14.379 --> 29:18.800
But you thrive on chaos,
and I don't and neither does UBA.

29:19.384 --> 29:22.387
With that said, of course, I would
support Mussolini

29:22.387 --> 29:25.349
if he brought me a deal from Paul Marks.

29:26.016 --> 29:28.810
Never took you for a fascist, Leonard.

29:29.811 --> 29:32.773
But you don't have the votes yet.

29:33.315 --> 29:35.442
I can't publicly support you.

29:35.442 --> 29:38.070
Do you really think Cybil
is the best the board can do?

29:40.989 --> 29:43.784
Well,
that non-answer is all the answer I need.

29:44.409 --> 29:48.455
And if Cybil is gone,
someone will have to take over.

29:48.455 --> 29:51.500
Nature abhors a vacuum.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.794
I've sat on a lot of boards, Cory.

29:53.794 --> 29:59.633
And if the headache you'd give me
is half the aneurysm you've given Cybil,

30:00.342 --> 30:01.552
then I'm not interested.

30:02.803 --> 30:05.222
Did you know my father was a binman?

30:06.139 --> 30:07.933
I'm sorry, a binman?

30:08.600 --> 30:13.105
Whatever you call them here.
Sanitary worker, rubbish collector.

30:13.105 --> 30:19.152
I watched him spend
his entire adult existence waist-deep

30:19.152 --> 30:22.030
in the putrid detritus
of other people's lives,

30:22.030 --> 30:27.995
and he did it without complaint
so that I wouldn't have to be a binman.

30:27.995 --> 30:32.082
I have never been a binman.
I won't start now.

30:32.666 --> 30:36.211
So, Cory,
either you clean up your own mess,

30:37.379 --> 30:39.298
or you get the fuck out of the way.

30:45.846 --> 30:48.849
- Another round? Yeah!
- Hell yeah.

30:50.058 --> 30:51.351
Your chest is blowing up.

30:51.351 --> 30:52.519
What?

30:52.519 --> 30:55.772
Your bra. Someone's calling your bra.

30:56.815 --> 31:00.611
- I bet it's Chris.
- Tell her to get her ass down here.

31:01.445 --> 31:02.446
It's Bradley.

31:02.446 --> 31:05.324
Does she want her white guilt assuaged?

31:05.324 --> 31:08.243
I know she means well,
but after Yanko's genealogy lesson,

31:08.243 --> 31:12.122
I can't do another
after-school special with the talent.

31:12.122 --> 31:14.416
Sorry, Bradley Jackson.

31:14.416 --> 31:16.919
Oh, Yanko.

31:18.212 --> 31:20.255
Remember when he punched
that guy in the street?

31:20.255 --> 31:21.632
Yes, I do.

31:21.632 --> 31:27.387
Okay, I know I'm not allowed
to say it because of toxic masculinity,

31:27.387 --> 31:29.306
but that was hot.

31:29.806 --> 31:31.058
It was kinda hot.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.436
Yanko can be problematic

31:34.436 --> 31:36.313
- and also hot.
- And also hot.

31:36.313 --> 31:37.856
- Did we say that out loud?
- Oh, no.

31:37.856 --> 31:39.775
Is my phone listening?

31:45.072 --> 31:46.198
I'm getting more drinks.

31:46.198 --> 31:48.242
Hi, can I-- Yeah, thanks.

31:48.825 --> 31:49.660
Hey.

31:50.244 --> 31:52.412
Wait, is that-- is that Kyle?

31:53.705 --> 31:54.831
Oh, God, it is.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.920
I'm gonna go talk to him
and find out what Cory's up to.

31:59.920 --> 32:01.046
- No! You can't--
- Yes.

32:04.424 --> 32:07.386
- Kyle? Oh, my God.
- Stella?

32:07.386 --> 32:09.179
- Come on. Bring it in.
- Hi. Hi.

32:09.179 --> 32:10.556
- Hi.
- What's up?

32:10.556 --> 32:12.474
- This is crazy.
- Yeah.

32:13.225 --> 32:14.893
Cory's meeting with the board right now.

32:14.893 --> 32:17.104
He doesn't give a shit
about reforming UBA.

32:17.104 --> 32:20.691
He's at war with Cybil, and we--
We're just pawns.

32:22.818 --> 32:25.863
- What?
- I am a pawn. You're in the game.

32:25.863 --> 32:28.115
What? What is that supposed to mean?

32:28.115 --> 32:30.158
Cybil is your girl, right?

32:30.158 --> 32:32.119
Or, I don't know...

32:32.119 --> 32:33.537
Wait, what?

32:33.537 --> 32:37.291
You think that I'm protecting her,
that I'm-- that I'm complicit in this?

32:37.291 --> 32:40.169
Stella, I'm confused,
why are you taking her side?

32:41.003 --> 32:44.047
It's like you're attaching yourself
to power wherever it is.

32:44.047 --> 32:45.382
That's not my style.

32:46.133 --> 32:47.593
Cybil may have issues,

32:47.593 --> 32:52.556
but at least she's not trying to sell us
to Paul Marks like Cory is.

32:52.556 --> 32:56.476
Well, Paul may be another overlord,
but at least he's writing checks.

32:57.227 --> 33:00.397
Aren't you tired of everybody
in the C-suite crying poor?

33:06.945 --> 33:07.946
What?

33:08.739 --> 33:09.907
What aren't you saying?

33:09.907 --> 33:13.660
Paul and I, we used to work together.

33:14.411 --> 33:16.955
We have a history,
and it's not a good one.

33:16.955 --> 33:20.417
- Did he do something--
- No, no, it's nothing like that.

33:20.417 --> 33:21.502
He's too smart.

33:22.002 --> 33:23.795
If there's one thing about Paul...

33:27.341 --> 33:28.175
he's ruthless.

33:30.344 --> 33:32.304
- Did you tell Cory?
- He doesn't care.

33:33.472 --> 33:35.516
And who can you trust in that building?

33:35.516 --> 33:37.351
The only way UBA can sell trust

33:37.351 --> 33:41.104
is by putting it in all caps
under Alex Levy's face on a billboard.

33:46.818 --> 33:47.819
You came.

33:48.737 --> 33:50.572
Looks like I missed a fun night.

33:50.572 --> 33:53.742
- Hey.
- Hey, Chris, how are you holding up?

33:53.742 --> 33:56.453
Yeah, I look like I'm in
the witness protection program, so...

33:56.453 --> 33:57.955
Do you want to duck into someplace quiet?

33:57.955 --> 33:59.873
- I mean, there's a--
- I'm done with quiet.

34:00.916 --> 34:03.752
I want to interview Cybil on <i>TMS</i>.

34:06.797 --> 34:08.966
- Really?
- Alex and I talked about it,

34:10.132 --> 34:11.134
and it should be me.

34:14.888 --> 34:15.889
Okay.

34:17.014 --> 34:18.766
- Only do this if you are sure.
- Yeah.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.686
You don't have anything to prove here.

34:20.686 --> 34:21.728
I know.

34:21.728 --> 34:26.525
And trust me, the last thing I wanna do
is talk to Cybil, but I'm gonna do it.

34:28.068 --> 34:30.987
Hey, imagine the ratings.

34:30.987 --> 34:33.197
The ratings, yes.

34:33.197 --> 34:35.242
Absolutely not. She's not doing it.

34:35.242 --> 34:38.745
<i>Alex Unfiltered</i> is one thing,
but nobody is tuning into

34:38.745 --> 34:41.206
<i>The Morning Show</i>'s version
of Obama's "Beer Summit".

34:41.206 --> 34:44.208
If he couldn't make it work,
we sure as hell can't.

34:44.208 --> 34:48.338
I love the Hail Mary, but no.

34:48.839 --> 34:52.467
I love Hail Marys too.
I especially love a Hail Mary

34:52.467 --> 34:55.179
where a network's CEO leaks
an embarrassing email

34:55.179 --> 34:58.515
to knock out his board chair and,
you know,

34:58.515 --> 35:02.686
casually weaponizes 400 years of racism
to close a deal with a billionaire.

35:24.666 --> 35:26.877
That's quite the accusation, Stella.

35:26.877 --> 35:28.587
Before you tell me I'm wrong,

35:28.587 --> 35:30.923
just know that your left eye twitches
when you're lying.

35:34.134 --> 35:36.720
You let this get away from you, Cory.

35:40.182 --> 35:45.395
No, no, no. Nope, I can't do it.
I cannot go on <i>The Morning Show</i>.

35:45.395 --> 35:47.564
Cybil, you have to do this.

35:47.564 --> 35:51.777
It's what Chris wants,
and she deserves to have her say too.

35:51.777 --> 35:56.615
It's time for you to stop behaving
like some fragile white woman.

35:56.615 --> 35:58.075
I'm fragile?

35:58.784 --> 36:00.661
Could you have survived the '70s?

36:02.746 --> 36:05.582
We are aware that you're formidable.

36:11.630 --> 36:18.220
I keep running it back in my mind over
and over and over.

36:20.222 --> 36:21.765
I can't believe I wrote that.

36:23.559 --> 36:28.772
I-- I would never undermine
another woman at work.

36:31.024 --> 36:33.360
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.697
And I think you're just gonna have
to answer that on <i>TMS</i>.

36:36.697 --> 36:39.533
Why? They've-- They've decided who I am.

36:40.117 --> 36:43.120
And you watch, after I'm gone,

36:43.120 --> 36:46.623
they'll all pretend that...
solved the problem.

36:47.583 --> 36:50.460
And they'll still just cross
to the other side of the street

36:50.460 --> 36:52.004
if they see a person of color.

36:53.088 --> 36:56.466
I would--
I would not say that part on air.

36:56.967 --> 36:58.051
Oh, God.

37:00.179 --> 37:01.180
I made a joke.

37:03.891 --> 37:05.267
A tasteless joke.

37:05.267 --> 37:09.438
And now that joke is my legacy?

37:09.438 --> 37:11.356
My family's legacy?

37:12.232 --> 37:17.404
Eighty years of all that we built
is just wiped out by a--

37:17.404 --> 37:19.698
by a thoughtless email?

37:19.698 --> 37:22.743
Cybil, it's so much more than one email.

37:22.743 --> 37:28.707
You paid a Black woman less than
a white woman for the exact same job.

37:28.707 --> 37:33.045
And I understand that you don't think
that this is reflective of who you are,

37:33.045 --> 37:37.716
but this is your chance to own it,
and you're gonna redefine it.

37:40.594 --> 37:43.722
Still to come,
we'll follow up with Marge and Kathy,

37:43.722 --> 37:47.351
identical twins reunited
after a chance run-in

37:47.351 --> 37:49.603
at the Cider Days pie eating contest.

37:49.603 --> 37:51.522
Can you imagine that? You're just sampling

37:51.522 --> 37:53.232
a slice of strawberry rhubarb and then,

37:53.232 --> 37:54.650
- wham, your twin.
- I know.

37:54.650 --> 37:56.944
It's competitive eating,
it's full of surprises.

37:56.944 --> 37:58.403
Up next,

37:58.403 --> 38:01.114
a conversation about race
in corporate America

38:01.114 --> 38:03.659
with UBA Board Chair, Cybil Reynolds,

38:03.659 --> 38:08.080
and our very own Chris Hunter.
We'll be right back after this break.

38:08.580 --> 38:09.873
And we're clear.

38:09.873 --> 38:11.625
- Oh, my God. Fucking tough pivot.
- God.

38:11.625 --> 38:13.377
- No shit.
- Holy-- Jesus Christ.

38:13.377 --> 38:15.671
And Chris has-- Chris has got
a lot of guts, taking this on.

38:15.671 --> 38:17.130
Yeah, she does. She sure does.

38:18.090 --> 38:19.800
Okay. We're three minutes out.

38:19.800 --> 38:22.719
You're gonna stay on point.
Remember to breathe, right?

38:22.719 --> 38:25.222
Remember, it's a four-minute segment,

38:25.222 --> 38:27.391
and they might go just a little longer.

38:27.391 --> 38:30.477
Well, the great thing about
a live broadcast they have to cut away

38:30.477 --> 38:32.521
- to commercial at some point, so--
- Gotta pay those bills.

38:32.521 --> 38:33.564
It'll be all right.

38:33.564 --> 38:35.774
Just wanna do a touch-up
before you head out there.

38:35.774 --> 38:37.484
Those lights can be harsh.

38:37.484 --> 38:39.695
I was thinking we'll do a quick contour
right at the cheekbone.

38:39.695 --> 38:42.406
- Thank you.
- A little color. Don't wanna wash you out.

38:42.406 --> 38:45.033
And listen, you control the answers.

38:45.033 --> 38:46.577
She does not control the answers.

38:55.252 --> 38:56.253
One...

38:59.047 --> 39:01.091
two...

39:03.802 --> 39:05.262
three.

39:07.139 --> 39:09.141
Hey. Hello, babe.

39:10.976 --> 39:12.352
This is not a race.

39:16.481 --> 39:17.482
You're gonna be great.

39:19.067 --> 39:20.319
You were born great.

39:21.069 --> 39:22.571
What if I embarrass myself?

39:24.781 --> 39:26.825
What if I do this and all anyone sees

39:26.825 --> 39:31.496
is an angry Black woman beating up on
a defenseless little white lady...

39:31.496 --> 39:33.081
- That's not gonna happen.
- ...and--

39:33.081 --> 39:36.168
You got Mia in your ear
and me right offside.

40:03.278 --> 40:04.279
Come on, girl.

41:01.628 --> 41:03.213
- Oh, dear, would you hold this?
- Yep.

41:03.213 --> 41:05.674
- Ms. Reynolds, come with me please.
- Thank you.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.062
- Okay, watch your step.
- Thank you.

41:26.445 --> 41:27.738
God Almighty.

41:28.238 --> 41:30.407
Let's make sure we don't have
any audible delay.

41:30.407 --> 41:32.242
Copy that. No delay.

41:32.242 --> 41:34.620
- <i>Good to go for audio. No delay.</i>
- Check.

41:34.620 --> 41:36.955
Okay, everyone, let's keep this tight.

41:37.873 --> 41:40.626
Jim, I want you to stay closer.

41:55.557 --> 41:56.642
You got this, Chris.

41:58.352 --> 42:02.105
And in five, four, three...

42:05.275 --> 42:06.109
Welcome back.

42:06.693 --> 42:09.738
A few days ago,
a racially insensitive email surfaced

42:09.738 --> 42:11.907
from UBA board president, Cybil Reynolds.

42:12.824 --> 42:18.330
The email contained comments about me.
I haven't spoken out in public until now.

42:18.330 --> 42:22.000
And here to join me as I do so is
the woman who wrote those comments.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.920
UBA board president, Cybil Reynolds,
thank you for being here.

42:24.920 --> 42:26.213
Thank you for having me on.

42:26.839 --> 42:30.759
Now I know there was some furor,
well deserved,

42:30.759 --> 42:34.388
over the statement that UBA
issued some days ago.

42:35.180 --> 42:39.017
It was inadequate, to say the very least.

42:39.017 --> 42:44.523
The mistake was mine and mine alone,
and I'm here to apologize in person.

42:45.691 --> 42:50.112
Chris, I'm--
I am deeply sorry for what I said.

42:50.696 --> 42:53.448
Even in the heat of
a contentious hiring decision,

42:53.448 --> 42:56.785
nothing can excuse what I said.

42:56.785 --> 42:58.745
You mean calling me Aunt Jemima?

42:59.872 --> 43:02.249
I didn't exactly call you Aunt--

43:02.958 --> 43:04.334
I wanna set the record straight.

43:05.210 --> 43:09.840
You know that Aunt Jemima was on boxes
of pancake mix and not cereal, right?

43:09.840 --> 43:11.383
I guess I know that now.

43:12.092 --> 43:16.388
<i>But this is about more than
just an offhand comment.</i>

43:16.388 --> 43:20.392
The irony of your joke is that
the Pearl Milling Company

43:20.392 --> 43:24.396
used the image and likeness of
a Black woman to sell a brand,

43:24.396 --> 43:26.815
I'm sure, with no profit participation.

43:26.815 --> 43:30.777
My question is what brand
am I helping UBA to sell, in your eyes?

43:30.777 --> 43:35.532
Look, words matter. Actions matter more.

43:35.532 --> 43:40.245
And UBA has been sorely inactive
when it comes to equity and inclusion.

43:40.829 --> 43:44.583
Now, the board isn't involved
with day-to-day operations.

43:44.583 --> 43:48.003
We leave that to
the capable leadership of our CEO.

43:49.338 --> 43:55.469
But when that leadership falters,
I have a duty to step in.

43:55.469 --> 43:58.055
Don't you fucking dare.

43:59.223 --> 44:01.934
- She firing shots at Cory?
- He deserves them.

44:02.434 --> 44:04.186
<i>I'm not sure you're answering my question.</i>

44:04.186 --> 44:06.980
- <i>Oh.</i>
- <i>But let's talk about stepping in.</i>

44:06.980 --> 44:08.315
<i>What would that look like?</i>

44:08.315 --> 44:11.610
<i>Do you even think it's possible
to win back the trust of UBA's employees?</i>

44:12.110 --> 44:15.030
You know something? I do.

44:16.198 --> 44:17.407
I do think it's possible.

44:17.407 --> 44:22.204
And it'll start with a dialogue
between UBA employees and the board.

44:22.204 --> 44:28.168
From now on, you all will have
a voice at every single board meeting.

44:28.168 --> 44:30.170
Now is the time for transparency.

44:30.170 --> 44:31.672
That's great to hear, truly.

44:32.840 --> 44:35.551
In the interest of transparency,

44:36.385 --> 44:41.265
was I hired for a permanent
anchor position because I am Black?

44:43.767 --> 44:45.394
Obviously not. No.

44:45.394 --> 44:47.104
<i>But you see my confusion, right?</i>

44:47.104 --> 44:51.441
Because you used a clumsy racist comment

44:51.441 --> 44:53.569
to complain about my hiring.

44:53.569 --> 44:56.280
Did you think I wasn't qualified,
was that it?

44:57.614 --> 45:00.617
Well, now in point of fact, at that time,

45:00.617 --> 45:02.828
I did not believe you were qualified.

45:02.828 --> 45:06.456
Let me rephrase. You were untested.

45:06.456 --> 45:08.166
<i>Well, that's not exactly true.</i>

45:08.166 --> 45:10.419
Were you aware that I was cue tested

45:11.253 --> 45:15.507
more than any other person who
has ever anchored this show?

45:16.091 --> 45:18.427
That I had to have eight different
approval meetings

45:18.427 --> 45:21.638
in addition to the strategy discussions
about my hair?

45:21.638 --> 45:23.015
I was unaware.

45:23.015 --> 45:28.437
And I still found time to
spend weekends with four former anchors,

45:28.437 --> 45:30.814
developing my on-air skills.

45:30.814 --> 45:33.817
Well, now that-that is impressive.
That's very admirable.

45:33.817 --> 45:36.278
That aside,
I don't understand why you used

45:36.278 --> 45:38.572
a racialized image when discussing me.

45:39.823 --> 45:41.116
Is that how you see me?

45:42.284 --> 45:45.329
Is that how you see us?

45:56.590 --> 46:02.095
Would you want your entire career
reduced to one unthinking,

46:02.095 --> 46:04.431
bone-headed thing you said in an email?

46:04.431 --> 46:08.852
Haven't you ever said anything
that later you came to regret

46:08.852 --> 46:10.521
when speaking casually?

46:10.521 --> 46:13.190
<i>You're in a leadership position
at this network.</i>

46:13.190 --> 46:14.733
And on your watch,

46:15.275 --> 46:20.280
you let employees of color
be systematically devalued.

46:21.532 --> 46:23.283
Is that something to be casual about?

46:23.867 --> 46:25.619
Donny,
tell the camera to push in on Cybil,

46:25.619 --> 46:28.372
- and keep pushing until I see her pores.
- We're supposed to break.

46:28.372 --> 46:30.415
- You want me to cut--
- No. No.

46:30.415 --> 46:33.502
Okay. Camera two, push in. Closer.

46:33.502 --> 46:34.586
<i>No.</i>

46:36.255 --> 46:38.715
<i>I was careless,
and there isn't any excuse.</i>

46:38.715 --> 46:41.301
But you have to understand.

46:41.301 --> 46:44.888
We don't just give this opportunity
to anyone.

46:45.514 --> 46:49.935
Anyone who sits in that chair
has to be grateful--

46:49.935 --> 46:51.019
I sh--

46:51.603 --> 46:52.646
There it is.

46:53.772 --> 46:54.773
I should be grateful?

46:54.773 --> 46:58.485
Well,
that your job is so very hard to get.

47:02.739 --> 47:06.785
I want to say,
as for UBA as an institution,

47:06.785 --> 47:08.704
going forward, I think we've--

47:08.704 --> 47:13.792
We should move on from this climate
where racial divisions are exploited.

47:13.792 --> 47:15.961
But that's every climate though,
wouldn't you say?

47:20.966 --> 47:22.301
Shit.

47:24.803 --> 47:29.224
But yes,
we will move on from institutional racism

47:29.224 --> 47:30.517
right after this break.

47:31.476 --> 47:32.477
Keep it here.

47:33.270 --> 47:35.898
And we're out. Wow.

47:39.526 --> 47:40.777
Is that...

47:44.781 --> 47:46.575
Right. Of course, of course.

47:52.998 --> 47:54.541
- Ready?
- Thank you.

47:59.630 --> 48:00.797
Oh, my God.

48:03.091 --> 48:04.092
Let's go.

48:05.010 --> 48:08.722
That was a crash and burn.

48:10.349 --> 48:11.391
Mia, it's Cory.

48:11.391 --> 48:14.353
- What? Seriously?
- I'll take it. It's fine.

48:17.022 --> 48:18.148
What can I do for you, Cory?

48:18.148 --> 48:21.735
Well, I just wanna say congrats
on that great segment.

48:21.735 --> 48:25.072
And by the way,
we'll eat the cost of delaying that break.

48:25.072 --> 48:27.157
I'll make it up to the advertisers
at upfronts.

48:27.157 --> 48:28.325
Yeah, I have no doubt.

48:28.325 --> 48:30.702
<i>Just let me know when
those ratings numbers come in.</i>

48:34.331 --> 48:38.335
Layla, aren't you gonna congratulate Chris
on a great segment?

48:39.086 --> 48:40.337
Me? Why?

48:40.337 --> 48:43.507
That's what anchor producers do.
Now get going.

48:43.507 --> 48:45.259
You're not serious.

48:45.259 --> 48:46.343
It's long overdue.

48:47.386 --> 48:48.387
Go.

48:49.096 --> 48:51.807
- You got it. Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

48:55.602 --> 48:56.728
Folks,

48:56.728 --> 49:01.191
there are train wrecks and then there's
whatever that was on <i>The Morning Show</i>.

49:01.191 --> 49:04.903
Cybil Reynolds didn't just step in it,
she danced a foxtrot.

49:06.113 --> 49:10.576
With that, I call our vote
of no confidence to order.

49:10.576 --> 49:13.620
All those in favor,
please raise your hand.

49:42.149 --> 49:45.152
Kyle, get me Paul Marks now.

49:45.152 --> 49:46.820
And I don't care if he's back on
that rocket,

49:46.820 --> 49:49.948
and I don't care if that rocket
has reached Jupiter.

49:49.948 --> 49:51.950
You will charter me transport to Jupiter.

49:51.950 --> 49:55.913
You'll get me an UberComet,
whatever the hell that is.

49:55.913 --> 49:58.123
My friends in the assistant mafia
say he's in SoHo.

49:58.832 --> 49:59.958
Well, that's closer.

49:59.958 --> 50:01.502
Yeah, I'll get the driver.

50:10.427 --> 50:12.221
Hey, thank you so much for coming.

50:13.138 --> 50:14.389
Well, enjoy your evening.

50:15.432 --> 50:17.643
- Cory.
- Amanda.

50:17.643 --> 50:19.394
You got some pep in your step.

50:19.394 --> 50:22.105
Recharged after sleeping
in your coffin all day?

50:23.273 --> 50:25.442
You and your power suit never disappoint.

50:26.068 --> 50:27.653
This event is private.

50:27.653 --> 50:33.575
While I'm intrigued by your new
bouncer cosplay, but Paul's expecting me.

50:33.575 --> 50:35.702
If he were expecting you,
I'd know about it.

50:35.702 --> 50:41.542
I know that you're paid to be Paul's
guard dog, but don't toy with me, Amanda.

50:42.334 --> 50:44.253
I'm not a fidget spinner.

50:45.921 --> 50:48.257
- Cory.
- Nice to see you, Paul.

50:50.259 --> 50:52.219
- Do we have something on the books?
- No.

50:52.219 --> 50:55.848
Cybil's out.
We got the votes. Path is clear.

50:57.558 --> 51:00.143
- I'll take it from here.
- Copy.

51:01.770 --> 51:03.397
Look, Cory, I appreciate you coming by,

51:03.397 --> 51:05.816
but does this-this deal
have to be this hard?

51:07.734 --> 51:10.612
Are you telling me you got to
where you are by doing easy deals?

51:10.612 --> 51:13.907
I wanted to buy a legacy media company.

51:13.907 --> 51:18.871
Legacy media means brand safety.
UBA is no longer safe. It's a shit show.

51:18.871 --> 51:21.748
UBA is number one again, Paul.

51:21.748 --> 51:25.210
Yeah, well, any car crash
is gonna gather a lot of eyeballs.

51:25.794 --> 51:28.463
But here's the thing about car crashes.
They're fuck ups.

51:29.298 --> 51:31.008
They're mistakes. They're accidents.

51:31.008 --> 51:34.303
And I know you look at your fuck ups
as opportunities,

51:34.303 --> 51:35.387
but I got an idea for you.

51:35.387 --> 51:37.848
Maybe you don't fuck up
in the first place.

51:38.515 --> 51:39.975
Where else are you gonna go?

51:39.975 --> 51:42.436
NBN,
is that who you're meeting with in there?

51:42.436 --> 51:46.815
I have options.
UBA, no longer one of them.

51:47.941 --> 51:49.401
Thanks for coming by.
