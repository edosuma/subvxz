WEBVTT

00:03.704 --> 00:05.704
(Birds screeching)

00:05.706 --> 00:08.374
(Wind whistling softly)

00:11.579 --> 00:13.345
Elaine:<i> Next time you do</i>
<i> a research trip</i>

00:13.347 --> 00:14.980
<i> through the middle east,</i>

00:14.981 --> 00:16.614
remind me not to waste
my leave tagging along.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.150
Look, no one forced
you to come.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.618
Spencer, you literally
got on your knees

00:19.620 --> 00:21.120
and begged me to come.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.354
And you said yes.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.790
We never should have
left Turkey.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.096
What is this, anyway?

00:31.098 --> 00:32.798
There's nothing
out there.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.067
(Heart beating slowly)

00:38.339 --> 00:40.506
I thought you were
writing about city life.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.809
(Bullet whistles)

00:43.811 --> 00:44.710
(Grunts)

00:44.712 --> 00:46.178
(Screaming, panting)

00:50.384 --> 00:52.184
(Panting)

00:54.455 --> 00:56.455
Spencer.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.496
(Panting)

01:14.408 --> 01:15.374
(Scope beeps)

01:16.444 --> 01:17.643
(Bullet whistles)

01:17.645 --> 01:18.644
(Grunts)

01:18.646 --> 01:20.712
(Gunshot echoing in distance)

01:25.586 --> 01:27.653
¶ ¶

01:56.350 --> 01:58.183
(elevator bell dings)

01:58.185 --> 02:00.786
Oh, god,
i love springtime.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.521
Crisp air.
Fresh start.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.223
Out with the old, in...

02:04.225 --> 02:06.158
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.861
I'll be honest, I didn't get any
spring cleaning done last night.

02:08.863 --> 02:10.429
What about our pact?

02:10.431 --> 02:13.398
I know I was gonna get
some done this morning,

02:13.400 --> 02:15.367
but Delilah
kind of made breakfast.

02:15.369 --> 02:18.537
The whole point of the pact
is to motivate each other.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.239
I know, but this breakfast
was amazing.

02:20.241 --> 02:23.275
She made a burrito, a breakfast
burrito, with seven layers.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.611
All right, look, you want me
to do the spring cleaning,

02:25.613 --> 02:27.212
I can start right now.

02:27.214 --> 02:28.413
These two drawers down here,

02:28.415 --> 02:29.915
I haven't touched those
in a least a decade.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.283
I'll get started on those.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.650
I started on my storage unit
this morning.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.154
My mom sent me
these boxes of junk

02:35.156 --> 02:37.523
from when I was a kid,
and I am plowing through them.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.758
Wow. Look at this.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.396
Huh. Is that you?

02:44.398 --> 02:45.564
Hey, hey. Look.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.399
That's the picture
Kate drew of you, huh?

02:47.401 --> 02:48.700
She really knew
how to capture

02:48.702 --> 02:49.768
the essence of the nerd.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.303
By the way, spring
cleaning pact--

02:51.305 --> 02:52.504
super awesome.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.306
High five.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.440
And I'm the nerd.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.409
Went into my junk
drawer last night.

02:57.411 --> 03:02.181
Cleaned that thing out,
found a little pot of gold.

03:02.183 --> 03:05.350
Bishop: Mm, gift certificate to
angelini's Italian restaurant.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.252
Mm-hmm, it was a Valentine's day
gift from my father.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.754
Bishop:
Tony, this is far.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.689
You're gonna drive two
hours for spaghetti?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.558
I think the bigger question is:

03:12.560 --> 03:14.793
Why did your dad get you
a Valentine's day gift?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.328
Because he loves me, Tim.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.563
The two-hour drive

03:17.565 --> 03:19.565
up historic route 1
is half the appeal.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.568
I am gonna rent a motorcycle.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.571
Like Marlon Brando
in<i> the wild one.</i>

03:25.573 --> 03:27.573
Then I'm gonna top it off
with some marinara.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.875
All I need to do is find
a lovely lady to hop on back

03:29.877 --> 03:31.210
and be my Mary Murphy.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.544
How about Stephanie?

03:32.546 --> 03:35.480
Sarah? Angelique?

03:35.482 --> 03:36.982
No. It needs to be
somebody special.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.351
Ah, watch it, DiNozzo.
Coming through.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.352
Bishop:
Gibbs,

03:40.354 --> 03:41.420
did you bring us coffee?

03:41.422 --> 03:42.521
No. Coffee's mine.
McGee:
All of it?

03:42.522 --> 03:43.621
Gibbs:
Yeah, I didn't sleep last night.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.557
Tony:
Well, that's not healthy. Why?

03:45.559 --> 03:46.925
DiNozzo, if I wanted you
to know, I would've told you.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.660
Come on, let's go.
MTAC.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.862
We got special agent west
at al asad. Let's go.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.231
Appreciate you coming onboard.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.266
Vance:
What are we looking at?

03:54.268 --> 03:55.434
Three victims.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.702
One local, two Americans.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.537
We positively I.D.'D the couple

03:58.539 --> 04:02.507
as chief petty officer Elaine
dodd and her husband Spencer.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.543
I'm guessing Iraqi police
took custody of the local body.

04:04.545 --> 04:05.477
That's correct.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.678
And I took the Liberty

04:06.680 --> 04:08.280
of having the dodds' remains
transported.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.549
You should receive them shortly.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.317
Agent west, what were
these two doing in Iraq?

04:12.319 --> 04:13.752
Visit was personal in nature.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.621
Cpo dodd was on leave.

04:15.623 --> 04:16.939
According to
your report,

04:16.940 --> 04:18.256
the incident happened
several days ago.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.591
As an estimate, yes.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.661
But news of it didn't reach us
until yesterday.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.496
Insurgents?
This is their territory.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.665
American targets,
apparently random.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.467
This attack fits the bill.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.669
Random or not, this is an
assassination of two of our own.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.804
The Iraqi police
can do as they please.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.506
I want an investigation.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.125
We'll repatriate
the bodies,

04:36.126 --> 04:37.743
you and your team
will handle anything in-field.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.379
Director,
there's something else.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.181
The scene was a mess.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.982
Those bullets had to be carrying
quite a bit of speed.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.517
Shot from a distance.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.985
And with extreme accuracy.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.387
Sniper.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.755
Insurgents in the area
have been known

04:49.757 --> 04:52.324
to attach Chinese scopes
to Soviet rifles.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.059
True, but we canvassed
within a mile radius.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.378
There's no witnesses.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.696
Now, it's possible our shooter
was a stealthy s.O.B.,

04:58.699 --> 05:00.032
but I happen to think otherwise.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.601
S.O.B. Fired from
over a mile away?

05:02.603 --> 05:04.303
Which means
he had access to a weapon

05:04.305 --> 05:06.405
more advanced than
I've ever seen them use.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.706
Until this threat
is neutralized,

05:07.708 --> 05:09.608
every American
on the ground out here

05:09.610 --> 05:11.343
is in a whole new
kind of danger.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.553
You know, Mr. Palmer,

05:21.555 --> 05:24.389
sharpshooters have been around
for centuries.

05:24.391 --> 05:28.994
In fact, in a way, America owes
its independence to a sniper.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.395
Really, doctor?

05:30.397 --> 05:31.630
Yes, his name was

05:31.632 --> 05:33.432
captain Patrick ferguson.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.600
And I might add,
he was a fellow scot.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.602
Well, if he was fighting
for the British,

05:37.604 --> 05:40.005
he must have done a pretty awful
job if he won the war for us.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.606
(Chuckles)
On the contrary.

05:41.608 --> 05:44.676
Ferguson was the finest shot
in the British army.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.745
Yes, at the battle
of brandywine,

05:46.747 --> 05:49.948
he had an American officer
in his sights.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.451
But the officer had
his back turned,

05:52.453 --> 05:55.721
and ferguson thought it was
dishonorable to take the shot.

05:55.723 --> 06:00.992
That American officer was
general George Washington.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.994
So if ferguson
would've taken that shot,

06:02.996 --> 06:05.397
(english accent): Then we'd all
be wearing powdered wigs

06:05.399 --> 06:07.799
and talking like we're
sophisticated and whatnot.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.435
(Laughs) Because that's
how they roll in britain.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.141
The point is, Mr. Palmer,

06:16.143 --> 06:19.745
that a single act
can have ramifications

06:19.747 --> 06:21.646
beyond one's own comprehension.

06:21.648 --> 06:22.714
(Elevator bell dings)

06:23.984 --> 06:25.484
Ah, now, Jethro.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.818
What do you got, duck?

06:26.820 --> 06:29.488
The bullets had
tremendous velocity.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.689
They went (Sputters)
Through-and-through.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.691
They were precise
kill shots to the chest,

06:32.693 --> 06:35.794
despite the fact that they were
fast-moving targets.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.829
This was the work of a
highly-skilled sniper

06:37.831 --> 06:39.398
with a formidable
weapon.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.832
You got a time of death?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.601
(Chuckles)
That's a bit tricky.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.504
With the lack
of detailed

06:45.506 --> 06:47.038
Iraqi police records

06:47.040 --> 06:49.674
and varied travel temperatures,
time zones...

06:49.676 --> 06:50.709
Ballpark.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.778
Well, three days ago.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.679
What?

06:54.681 --> 06:56.982
Oh, bishop told me

06:56.984 --> 06:59.418
that you didn't get any sleep
last night,

06:59.420 --> 07:01.086
and honestly,
i don't see any sign of it.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.988
I mean, it's like, it's like
nothing ever gets to you.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.623
Like you're some kind
of superhero, you know?

07:04.625 --> 07:05.690
Like, uh, like,

07:05.692 --> 07:08.126
c-captain wolf-eyes. Yeah?

07:08.128 --> 07:09.694
(Groans)

07:14.701 --> 07:16.218
(Elevator bell dings)

07:16.219 --> 07:17.736
Every time he does that,
i feel special.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.538
(Chuckles softly)

07:20.507 --> 07:21.673
(Elevator bell dings)

07:21.675 --> 07:23.608
Gibbs. Gibbs.
How are you feeling?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.544
McGee told me that you
didn't get any sleep.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.012
Yeah, press conference
is at 10:00.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.797
Can we move on?

07:28.798 --> 07:30.581
Yeah. But first I have
to show you something.

07:32.953 --> 07:37.155
It's a caf-pow! Hands-free
drinking helmet.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.824
I just thought, you know,
after I heard

07:38.826 --> 07:40.525
how much coffee
you bought this morning,

07:40.527 --> 07:41.760
this would be an easier way

07:41.762 --> 07:44.129
to get caffeine in
emergency situations.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.031
It's like...
It's like a...

07:46.033 --> 07:49.734
A boost of magic
on your head.

07:49.736 --> 07:50.969
I ordered you one.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.905
Abbs, can we move on,
or what?
Yes.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.174
We are moving on
to these.

07:56.176 --> 07:59.544
The bullet fragments that ducky
pulled from the body.

07:59.546 --> 08:00.779
They give you a full picture?

08:00.781 --> 08:02.614
Enough to determine
the caliber.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.782
.338.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.016
Yeah, but there's more.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.718
I analyzed the composition.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.087
These are armor-
piercing bullets.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.090
They were specially manufactured
for the U.S. military.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.226
The weapon is one of ours?
I can't say for sure.

08:14.228 --> 08:16.862
But if it was, like,
where did it come from?

08:18.832 --> 08:21.933
Two months ago, a firefight
occurred just three miles west

08:21.935 --> 08:24.870
of the road where cpo dodd
and her husband were killed.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.539
McGee: Team of four experienced
special ops marines,

08:27.541 --> 08:29.274
including snipers, were on
a reconnaissance mission

08:29.276 --> 08:31.843
when they engaged
with insurgents.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.079
These marines were outfitted
with a prototype weapon, Gibbs.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.213
Tony:
Meet the xr-30.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.082
McGee: Built-in infrared
and suppressor.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.284
But the star
is the scope's

08:39.286 --> 08:40.819
high-grade electronic
tracking system.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.954
Takes the guesswork out of
hitting a moving target.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.789
And by guesswork,
you mean skill.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.291
McGee:
It's like a fighter jet.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.293
Locks onto its target,
computer does the rest.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.929
It's got a range of
up to 2,000 meters.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.064
You think one of these
killed our victims?

08:53.066 --> 08:54.733
Explains how the shooter
was able to hit

08:54.735 --> 08:56.485
a moving target
from the next town over.

08:56.486 --> 08:58.236
If that weapon were seized, our
military would be all over it.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.538
Bishop:
That's the thing, Gibbs,

08:59.540 --> 09:00.872
the marines didn't know.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.574
The after action report

09:02.575 --> 09:04.275
had all four weapons
destroyed by an rpg.

09:04.278 --> 09:06.711
Right after the firefight,
Iraqi army set up

09:06.713 --> 09:09.247
an outpost at the site
to curtail insurgent activity.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.616
Tony: Our guys went in,
analyzed the debris.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.984
Weapon fragments
were found.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.553
Only one marine survived.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.588
Gunnery sergeant
Aaron Davis.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.173
Bishop: As he was being
medevac'd out,

09:18.174 --> 09:19.757
Davis was conscious and talking
about the battle.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.259
Hasn't spoken about
the incident since.

09:21.261 --> 09:24.563
Looking down the scope,
it's likely Davis saw faces.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.565
He might be able to I.D.
Whoever captured the weapon.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.933
Where is he now?

09:27.935 --> 09:29.067
Still at Walter Reed recovering.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.302
He nearly lost his leg.

09:30.304 --> 09:31.937
He's also dealing with
impaired vision

09:31.939 --> 09:33.905
and posttraumatic
stress syndrome.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.907
He's got a long
road ahead of him.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.577
Grace:
<i> I don't know him personally.</i>

09:38.579 --> 09:40.712
<i> Several of my colleagues</i>
<i> are treating him.</i>

09:40.714 --> 09:43.582
I talked to his pt
and his psychiatrist,

09:43.584 --> 09:45.050
and I've read his file.

09:45.052 --> 09:48.219
Now, he doesn't remember,
or he doesn't want to?

09:48.221 --> 09:50.989
Mm, unclear.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.358
Either way, he's
completely shut down.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.627
Therapy's not working?

09:55.629 --> 09:58.163
Gibbs, Davis saw his brothers
blown away by an rpg.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.699
He was wounded and
defenseless for 30 minutes

10:00.701 --> 10:02.267
before medevac
could get to him.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.235
That had to feel
like a lifetime.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.271
Now he's back here;
He's struggling to put one foot

10:06.273 --> 10:08.139
in front of the other
the way he used to.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.641
And he's got 12 hours a day

10:09.643 --> 10:11.076
to stare at the wall
and think about it.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.711
Therapy's not working.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.313
(Sighs)

10:14.314 --> 10:15.914
Taft said you were an ass,
but my god.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.149
No, this is not about me.
No, I know.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.052
Crossword puzzles and meatloaf
and you're good to go.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.922
But the idea of a real
session-- pure lunacy.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.091
Hey, doc, taft didn't
tell you all of it, okay?

10:26.093 --> 10:27.692
I was in the corps.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.060
I saw combat.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.296
I lived it.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.898
I don't need your speeches
what it's like.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.669
But, hey, this isn't about you.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.909
Davis has a
16-year-old daughter.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.245
She's visited once
since he got back,

10:47.247 --> 10:49.648
and now he's refusing
to see her.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.183
I would like you to talk to him
and try to get through.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.885
Yeah, well, I'm not
gonna do it.

10:53.887 --> 10:57.255
Gunnery sergeant Davis
has a perfectly capable

10:57.257 --> 10:59.758
psychiatrist right here
in this hospital.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.993
I told you, one of my colleagues
is treating him.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.262
Doc, I need you to get through.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.296
That's right.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.365
You need.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.767
Ah, geez.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.201
Listen.
Will you just listen?

11:10.203 --> 11:12.003
No, you listen.

11:12.005 --> 11:17.275
Davis is more likely to connect
with you than anyone.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.078
I suggest you
talk to him.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.379
Sniper to sniper.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.914
That's right, popeye.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.916
Taft told me enough.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.217
Fact is, you and Davis,

11:26.219 --> 11:28.019
I couldn't have found
a better match.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.456
You snipers are a
very difficult breed.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.401
Gunnery sergeant Davis.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.237
Special agent Gibbs, NCIS.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.306
And I'm sorry
to barge in.

11:48.308 --> 11:51.109
Well, I was baking a cake

11:51.111 --> 11:54.946
and about to solve
the energy crisis, so...

11:54.948 --> 11:57.115
(Chuckles)

11:57.117 --> 11:59.484
I was hoping to talk
to you about the, uh,

11:59.486 --> 12:01.119
night you were wounded.

12:02.989 --> 12:04.956
One of your weapons
was captured.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.258
And we're looking for
the people who took it.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.429
No, the weapons
were, uh, destroyed.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.398
You sure?

12:13.400 --> 12:16.101
Yeah. I, uh... I can't, I can't,
i can't help you.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.368
(Groans)

12:17.370 --> 12:21.906
Hey, gunny, all I'm
asking is you try.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.909
(Sighs)

12:24.911 --> 12:27.378
Agent Gibbs? That's-that's
what it is? Agent Gibbs?

12:27.380 --> 12:28.379
(Clears throat)

12:28.381 --> 12:31.916
You want to know what I got?

12:31.918 --> 12:34.919
I got this room.

12:34.921 --> 12:40.191
This sad, little, borrowed room.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.196
It's mine.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.098
So...

12:47.100 --> 12:49.000
I'm telling you to get out.

12:58.545 --> 12:59.544
(Door closes)

12:59.546 --> 13:01.012
(Sighs)

13:09.523 --> 13:11.156
I'm thinking Cheryl.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.390
What?

13:12.392 --> 13:14.926
Back of the motorcycle,
wind in our hair.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.427
<i> Lady and the tramp </i>
spaghetti kiss.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.897
I'm thinking Cheryl.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.799
Right. Which one is Cheryl?

13:20.801 --> 13:23.168
You know, the one with
the crazy sexy glasses.

13:23.170 --> 13:26.070
Oh, right, right, right.
Crazy sexy glasses Cheryl, yes.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.438
She like Italian?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.507
(Laughs):
Oh, mcirish.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.843
Everybody likes Italian.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.444
You're up.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.446
Vance:
<i> What do we know?</i>

13:35.448 --> 13:37.015
Tony:<i> We're looking</i>
<i> at the possibility</i>

13:37.017 --> 13:38.817
the dodds were
targeted.
Cpo dodd

13:38.819 --> 13:40.318
was assigned to the Navy

13:40.320 --> 13:42.086
comptroller's office
at the Pentagon.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.455
Privy to a good deal of
financial information.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.857
It's possible
she could've gotten caught up

13:45.859 --> 13:47.425
in something
she couldn't get out of.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.228
And the husband?
He was doing
research for a novel.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.597
Supposedly, the wife was
just along for the ride.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.199
(Phone ringing)

13:54.201 --> 13:55.600
Gibbs.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.202
Boss, hey. I got you
on speakerphone here

13:57.204 --> 13:58.503
with Tony and director Vance.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.071
Anything?
Vance: Well, your team has

14:00.073 --> 14:01.873
gotten as far as theories,
Gibbs.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.976
I'm hoping you can show them up
with something more solid.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.111
Oh, afraid not.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.112
Did you talk to Davis?

14:08.114 --> 14:09.848
Talk's a strong word.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.149
You think
he saw who took the weapon?

14:11.151 --> 14:12.951
I don't know.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.886
He kicked me out of his room.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.120
You have to get him
to talk, Gibbs.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.288
(Chuckles)

14:17.290 --> 14:18.423
McGee,

14:18.425 --> 14:19.858
track down his daughter.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.125
See if maybe she has an in.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.327
On it.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.329
And in the meantime?
Gibbs: In the meantime,

14:24.331 --> 14:25.964
I sit here and wait.

14:25.966 --> 14:29.901
That doesn't seem like
a very wise use of time, Gibbs.

14:29.903 --> 14:32.871
Patient and stubborn.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.873
It's what snipers are.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.576
It's what we respond to.

14:40.914 --> 14:43.281
McGee:<i> When was the last time</i>
<i> you saw your father?</i>

14:43.283 --> 14:46.384
Um, when he first got
to the hospital.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.586
He asked me
not to come back

14:48.588 --> 14:50.655
until he gets better.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.958
You know, I think he's sorry
he taught me to look.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.960
He says everything's
in the details.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.662
Like how he looks
through his scope.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.097
So he thought
you'd be observant.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.498
Why would he be sorry for that?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.000
Because now I love details.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.103
Well, his leg--

15:05.105 --> 15:09.173
yeah, everyone sees that, but...

15:09.175 --> 15:12.911
I saw the way he covered it
with a blanket

15:12.913 --> 15:15.914
to make it look normal for me.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.549
And when I see something,
i have to say it.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.187
Like with you guys.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.456
What?

15:25.458 --> 15:28.459
Well, I know you were out
fighting crime.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.962
You both have blood
on your shirts.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.398
My god,
that's microscopic.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.233
I don't know
how you see this.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.968
It's actually not blood;
It's ketchup.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.503
I had a breakfast burrito
this morning.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.338
It was seven layers;
It was amazing.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.106
Mine's rust, actually.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.676
I was cleaning out
my storage unit this morning.

15:44.678 --> 15:47.712
Got into a little battle
with an old toy.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.014
Well, what else is
in your storage unit?

15:50.016 --> 15:51.516
Excuse me?

15:51.518 --> 15:54.385
I told you, I like details.

15:55.322 --> 15:58.556
Uh, you know, just old stuff.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.158
Agent bishop here is
a cleaning machine.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.259
Yep.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.961
Lightning speed.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.696
Yeah, but don't you want
to enjoy it?

16:04.698 --> 16:06.164
The cleaning?

16:06.166 --> 16:07.732
No.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.534
The memories.

16:11.571 --> 16:15.173
Riley, some of these details
that you're talking about,

16:15.175 --> 16:17.075
can you tell us any
about your dad?

16:17.077 --> 16:19.143
Mm.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.282
He used to sing all the time.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.417
(Chuckles)

16:26.419 --> 16:29.153
He always seemed happiest
when he was singing.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.292
(Upbeat rock song playing)

16:34.294 --> 16:37.061
¶ A blind man

16:37.063 --> 16:40.164

16:52.078 --> 16:54.145
(music continues)

16:58.618 --> 16:59.784
(Quietly):
What is this?

16:59.786 --> 17:01.319
Program's called musicorps.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.454
It helps wounded warriors
play music

17:03.456 --> 17:05.023
as part of their recovery.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.629
They even have a band
that performs.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.764
Sense of purpose.

17:12.766 --> 17:14.198
Instills confidence

17:14.200 --> 17:16.567
and improves function
in those with ptss

17:16.569 --> 17:19.203
and traumatic
brain injury.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.072
And it works, Gibbs.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.207
Not overnight, but it works.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.644
That's Arthur bloom.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.596
He's head of the program.

17:28.597 --> 17:30.547
I went to go talk to him
about enrolling Davis.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.450
What'd he say?

17:32.452 --> 17:35.086
Davis has been coming to this
room every day for three weeks,

17:35.088 --> 17:36.354
but he doesn't participate.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.356
He just sits in the back
and watches.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.591
¶ Checked out
some YouTube, too ¶

17:40.593 --> 17:42.827

18:09.456 --> 18:11.189
Riley, what's on
your necklace?

18:11.191 --> 18:12.457
Oh.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.192
Have you heard of a hog's tooth?

18:14.194 --> 18:15.660
Well, when a marine

18:15.662 --> 18:18.596
graduates sniper school,
they call him a hog.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.831
"Hunter of gunmen."

18:19.833 --> 18:22.333
Yeah. And at graduation,

18:22.335 --> 18:25.369
they get a necklace
called a hog's tooth.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.171
And the idea is

18:27.173 --> 18:29.407
there's a bullet out there
that's meant for you,

18:29.409 --> 18:32.410
but if you have it
around your neck,

18:32.412 --> 18:34.345
then you'll be safe.

18:35.849 --> 18:38.483
Last time I saw my dad,
he gave it to me.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.218
I didn't want
to take it,

18:40.220 --> 18:42.186
but he said
he didn't need it anymore.

18:42.188 --> 18:44.889
He was just gonna throw it away.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.161
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.896
We got something.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.699
Um, I know
i can think of more.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.134
Um, I can write it down.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.768
That'd be great.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.875
Tony: Spencer dodd's passport
was scanned at Dulles airport

19:03.877 --> 19:05.643
day after the murders.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.410
Whoever killed the dodds
was after a passport?

19:07.413 --> 19:09.881
It's a great way to get into
the country fast and undetected.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.549
Bishop: So our guy has
to look enough like dodd

19:11.551 --> 19:12.600
to be able to
pass for him.

19:12.601 --> 19:13.650
Do we have airport
surveillance?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.286
Abby's all over it.

19:16.222 --> 19:17.522
(Elevator bell dings)

19:17.524 --> 19:18.689
I'm all over it.
Tony: All right.

19:18.691 --> 19:19.924
Let's Abby the hell
out of this thing.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.792
Okay, Spencer dodd's
passport--

19:21.794 --> 19:23.895
the imposter used it to
sneak into the country.

19:23.897 --> 19:27.165
But the airport surveillance
i have on "Spencer imposter"

19:27.167 --> 19:28.266
is limited.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.634
How limited?

19:29.636 --> 19:32.170
Abby: This is
the best piece I got.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.671
That's it?
Piece of an ear?

19:33.673 --> 19:36.240
The Spencer imposter
is like the Houdini

19:36.242 --> 19:37.942
of airport surveillance.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.443
There's a little resemblance
to dodd.

19:39.445 --> 19:40.978
Radicalized American maybe?

19:40.979 --> 19:42.512
Could be. You get anything
else from this picture?

19:42.515 --> 19:45.349
Abby: I did find him
getting into a cab.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.651
And I got the cab number.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.352
Which company?
I'll get them on the phone.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.854
Already called them;
Waiting for a call back.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.256
Which gives us time
for me to show you

19:52.258 --> 19:54.192
my crazy cool project.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.228
So, I talked to Gibbs about
the awesomeness of musicorps,

19:57.230 --> 19:58.563
and then I called them.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.665
(Phone ringing)
Oh.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.200
Cab company.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.302
Forensic scientist
Abigail Sciuto.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.269
(Man speaks indistinctly
over phone)

20:05.271 --> 20:07.205
Thanks.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.973
Driver dropped off
Spencer imposter

20:08.975 --> 20:12.276
at the Drake motel
off state route 40.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.578
All right, McGee, let's go.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.213
Bishop, call the motel,
find the room number.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.280
Thank you, Abby!

20:16.282 --> 20:18.249
McGee:
Federal agents.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.253
He was here.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.565
I found something.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.756
He was shipping something?

20:41.757 --> 20:43.907
Well, packages were shipped
to the motel from Baghdad.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.444
Customs form says
photography equipment.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.982
But I'm guessing that would fit
the barrel of a gun pretty well.

20:50.984 --> 20:52.783
Scope.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.720
He took the xr-30 apart,
shipped it to himself.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.788
Must have it back together
by now.

21:05.999 --> 21:08.266
(Elevator bell dings)

21:10.336 --> 21:11.736
Tony:
Bishop, motel manager

21:11.738 --> 21:14.905
said our guy registered
under the name Robert Quinn.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.408
McGee: And packages were
addressed to the same name, too.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.676
That give us anything?

21:18.678 --> 21:20.911
No. Manager's description
matched the piece

21:20.913 --> 21:22.613
from our airport pic,
five-ten,

21:22.615 --> 21:24.148
Caucasian, glasses.

21:24.149 --> 21:25.682
We were actually able
to pull some fingerprints

21:25.685 --> 21:27.752
from the motel room. I'm gonna
get this stuff down to Abby.

21:27.754 --> 21:30.888
This Quinn kills an American
for a passport,

21:30.890 --> 21:34.892
ships himself an xr-30 in pieces
to get it by customs,

21:34.894 --> 21:36.394
then puts it back together.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.728
That's a whole lot of trouble.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.496
Mm.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.032
What's his target?

21:41.034 --> 21:43.334
Woman (Over P.A.):
Captain Wilson to dialysis.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.870
Captain Wilson,
please report to dialysis.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.850
(Gunshot, man grunts)

22:01.888 --> 22:02.953
(Gunshot, man grunts)

22:19.505 --> 22:21.739
(Gunshot echoes)

22:34.821 --> 22:37.822
How long were you planning
on sitting out there?

22:37.824 --> 22:40.758
Probably sleep better
out there than I did

22:40.760 --> 22:42.460
last night.
What?

22:42.462 --> 22:44.128
Insomnia?
No.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.964
No.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.066
Couch is old
and a spring popped through.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.368
Kept me up.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.002
What you doing
out on the couch?

22:52.004 --> 22:53.637
Wifey got you in the doghouse?

22:53.639 --> 22:56.707
No. No, it's nothing like that.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.009
The bedroom was ours, you know?

23:00.813 --> 23:02.880
And...

23:04.951 --> 23:07.985
Well, she passed away.

23:08.955 --> 23:11.088
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

23:13.693 --> 23:16.093
Well, I looked you up online.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.495
I'm online?

23:17.497 --> 23:18.562
(Chuckles):
Yes.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.965
We all are, sir.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.100
(Sighs)

23:23.102 --> 23:24.969
Why didn't you tell me
you were a hog?

23:27.039 --> 23:28.706
You see any action?

23:28.708 --> 23:29.907
Desert storm.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.142
What were you packing,

23:31.144 --> 23:32.877
m40?
A1.

23:32.879 --> 23:35.012
Ten-power, fixed mil-dot scope.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.047
What was the range
on that thing?
Depends who's shooting it.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.983
(Laughs)

23:38.985 --> 23:40.951
Yeah.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.787
900 meters.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.789
You like it?
Yeah, it was good to me.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.023
Nothing like what you carried.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.563
Ask me.

23:52.565 --> 23:55.833
You had a good hide
on the ground.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.003
Half a dozen insurgents
approaching.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.137
I saw one

24:00.139 --> 24:02.139
go into a building
across the way.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.908
I couldn't see
what he was doing,

24:03.910 --> 24:06.076
but he was whispering

24:06.078 --> 24:08.846
to a bunch of them in arabic.

24:11.050 --> 24:14.051
The rest of them were,
like, 90... 90 meters out.

24:15.922 --> 24:20.090
But then they had some friends
up on the hillside.

24:20.092 --> 24:22.126
We took an rpg.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.129
Your weapons?

24:25.131 --> 24:26.864
Well, when I came to,

24:26.866 --> 24:28.966
enemy was gone.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.068
Pretty sure they thought
i was dead.

24:31.070 --> 24:36.073
I thought the weapons
had been destroyed.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.009
There wasn't enough...

24:39.011 --> 24:41.145
Left of anyone else.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.517
So if they got one,
must have been mine.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.890
There's nothing
you could've done.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.626
I didn't see
any of their faces, so...

24:55.628 --> 24:57.795
You know,
you're wasting your time.

24:57.797 --> 25:00.865
No, not a waste, gunny.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.969
Um, excuse me.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.237
Hi.

25:06.239 --> 25:09.740
Um, I'm looking for
agent McGee or agent bishop.

25:09.742 --> 25:12.009
I-i finished writing
the stuff about my dad.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.511
I'll make sure they get that.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.045
Agent: I'll be over
by the elevator.

25:17.016 --> 25:20.050
My boss spoke with your dad.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.720
Really?
Mm-hmm.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.989
Well, do you think
he'd want to see me?

25:24.991 --> 25:26.791
I mean, if he talked
to your boss,

25:26.792 --> 25:28.592
then maybe he'll want
to talk to me, too.

25:28.594 --> 25:31.228
I mean, i-i should
just call him.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.031
Riley, you know what I think?

25:34.033 --> 25:35.933
You think...

25:35.935 --> 25:39.203
Good Italian food
is worth driving two hours for.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.906
How on earth do you know that?

25:41.908 --> 25:44.808
Gift certificate to angelini's.

25:44.810 --> 25:47.845
I went there with my dad
and grandma once.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.146
It was awesome.

25:49.148 --> 25:52.716
It was, like,
the perfect family night.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.919
You are very observant.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.287
And, yes,

25:56.289 --> 25:58.088
I'm looking forward
to that a lot.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.791
Well, it's all
about family, right?

26:07.667 --> 26:09.867
(Elevator bell dings)

26:09.869 --> 26:11.035
Gibbs, glad you're here.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.070
I've been dying to tell someone.
What, Abbs?

26:13.072 --> 26:14.655
Well, I contacted
musicorps

26:14.656 --> 26:16.239
to see if there was anything
i could do to help,

26:16.242 --> 26:18.292
and I started talking
to crouse.

26:18.293 --> 26:20.343
Crouse is in the band,
and crouse is amazing.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.780
He invented all these gadgets

26:22.782 --> 26:25.249
so that other wounded warriors
can play music instruments,

26:25.251 --> 26:27.251
and I am helping him
with this one.

26:27.253 --> 26:28.852
Well, what is it?

26:28.854 --> 26:30.955
It's a percussion instrument
made out of a guitar,

26:30.957 --> 26:33.123
so a soldier
that's lost his legs

26:33.125 --> 26:34.758
can play a full drum kit.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.628
With his hands.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.229
It's, like, the
greatest day ever.

26:39.231 --> 26:40.598
That's great, Abbs.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.099
I'm also really glad
that you're here

26:42.101 --> 26:44.602
because I have things
to tell you.

26:44.604 --> 26:47.271
Um, the fingerprints from
the motel gave me nothing,

26:47.273 --> 26:51.108
but this shipping box
gave me something.

26:51.110 --> 26:54.244
Quinn must have been
writing on top of it,

26:54.246 --> 26:56.146
because the pen went
through the paper

26:56.148 --> 26:57.348
and left these
indentations.

26:57.350 --> 26:58.682
What are the numbers for?

26:58.684 --> 27:01.251
Well, haven't figured
that out yet.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.289
I can tell by the
look on your face

27:05.291 --> 27:07.224
that there's something else
i can help you with.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.293
Whispering.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.197
(Whispering): I can't tell
by the look on your face

27:13.199 --> 27:14.965
that there's something else
i can help you with.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.634
No, no, Abbs, Abbs.

27:16.636 --> 27:17.901
Davis said he heard

27:17.903 --> 27:20.671
an insurgent whispering
to his friends.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.773
The friends were 90 meters out.

27:22.775 --> 27:26.176
Well, that's way too
far for a whisper.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.212
You think he was
talking to himself?

27:28.214 --> 27:30.247
No, I don't,
because I've seen it before.

27:30.249 --> 27:33.651
Insurgents in the area
taping their attacks

27:33.653 --> 27:35.252
for propaganda.
Ooh.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.721
Whispering into
a camera.

27:37.723 --> 27:39.189
Making a video.

27:39.191 --> 27:42.292
But instead there
was a firefight.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.294
But if the battle
were recorded,

27:44.296 --> 27:46.664
the insurgents
would've posted it,

27:46.666 --> 27:48.298
and we would've
heard about it.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.134
Unless...
Unless what?

27:50.136 --> 27:53.270
Well, we know that
the Iraqi military

27:53.272 --> 27:57.007
set up an outpost at the site
to curtail insurgent activity.

27:57.009 --> 28:00.144
So if the insurgents
had left a camera,

28:00.146 --> 28:02.680
but the site was
immediately occupied...

28:02.682 --> 28:04.148
They couldn't go
back and get it.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.416
Thanks, Abbs.

28:05.418 --> 28:06.717
Boss.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.285
Just spoke with Riley,
Davis's daughter.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.287
She went to go visit him
in the hospital.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.855
He left; No one knows
where he went.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.123
She's worried something
might've happened.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.793
Ping his phone, McGee.
Get me a location.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.872
(Car door opens, closes)

28:39.952 --> 28:41.385
(Gun clicks)

28:58.204 --> 29:00.104
Hey, gunny.

29:00.106 --> 29:01.839
(Siren wailing in distance)

29:04.076 --> 29:06.143
(Car door closes)

29:10.015 --> 29:11.749
Where are you headed?

29:13.352 --> 29:15.953
(Both chuckling)

29:20.025 --> 29:22.793
(Sighs)

29:22.795 --> 29:24.328
I don't know.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.769
Gibbs:
That captured xr-30--

29:31.771 --> 29:33.370
it's not worth that.

29:33.372 --> 29:35.506
Yeah, well, it's not
about the weapon.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.309
Riley called me.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.945
Said she wants
to see me.

29:43.816 --> 29:46.116
She'll never stop asking.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.418
And I will never

29:48.420 --> 29:50.988
want her to see me like this.

29:55.861 --> 29:58.495
We asked your daughter for help.

30:01.133 --> 30:04.535
She talked to my agents
all day about you.

30:04.537 --> 30:07.137
And when they had to leave...

30:09.074 --> 30:10.574
...she stayed.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.578
She practically wrote a book.

30:17.483 --> 30:20.317
When she looks at you,

30:20.319 --> 30:22.386
all she sees is her dad.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.999
I love her more than anything.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.071
You need help, gunny.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.542
Say you'll take it.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.526
Oh, you'll keep me posted?

31:03.462 --> 31:04.862
Yes, I appreciate it.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.330
Thank you.

31:06.332 --> 31:07.898
How's he doing?

31:07.900 --> 31:09.132
That was his therapist.

31:09.134 --> 31:11.168
They had a good session.
Good.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.936
So therapy's working.

31:12.938 --> 31:15.038
(Chuckles):
Oh, wow, Gibbs.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.040
Comic chops for miles.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.108
Who would've thought, really?

31:18.110 --> 31:19.543
The haircut is deceiving.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.279
Thank you.

31:22.281 --> 31:25.182
That day in the diner,
i met you for a reason.

31:25.184 --> 31:29.019
My husband says,
"the best way to help yourself

31:29.021 --> 31:31.054
"is to put your arm
around someone

31:31.056 --> 31:32.923
who needs it more than you do."

31:34.593 --> 31:37.127
Yeah, I don't wear my ring
to work.

31:37.129 --> 31:39.463
Um, it's better if patients
don't ask questions.

31:39.465 --> 31:40.430
About your husband?

31:40.432 --> 31:41.965
About me being a human being.

31:41.967 --> 31:44.067
Then why'd you
bring him up to me?

31:44.069 --> 31:45.569
Because I'm trying
to tell you something,

31:45.571 --> 31:48.405
and I really want you
to hear me.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.208
Whatever you did
for Davis,

31:51.210 --> 31:54.244
whatever you said, it landed.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.113
It made a difference.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.481
Good.

31:57.483 --> 32:00.183
So, tell me,
what about the other way around?

32:00.185 --> 32:01.685
What?

32:01.687 --> 32:03.186
What's he doing for you, popeye?

32:03.188 --> 32:04.521
What's he doing for me?
That's it.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.160
When you told me
to go talk to him,

32:10.162 --> 32:11.428
you were shrinking me.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.629
Ever hear of two birds?

32:12.631 --> 32:14.298
You throw some stone, doc.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.966
Come on, I'm dying to know,

32:15.968 --> 32:17.534
(phone rings)
What did it get you? (Groans)

32:17.536 --> 32:20.203
(Sighs)

32:20.205 --> 32:21.571
Yeah, DiNozzo, I'm on the way.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.241
(Elevator bell dings)

32:25.678 --> 32:27.077
Sitrep.

32:27.079 --> 32:29.379
Agent west recovered
the insurgents' camera.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.248
Some kid found it
planted in the building,

32:31.250 --> 32:34.017
took it home to play with
before west got to it.

32:34.019 --> 32:36.086
Lot of the footage was erased,
but we had enough to match

32:36.088 --> 32:37.988
one of the insurgents to
our description of Quinn.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.157
Abby got a hit
on facial recognition.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.025
Quinn's real name
is Matthew cross.

32:42.027 --> 32:44.328
Here's a composite of
what he might look like now.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.996
Bolo's out wide.
Duck?

32:45.998 --> 32:48.398
Cross was a one-time sniper
with the British s.A.S.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.300
His parents were missionaries.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.203
He spent several of
his formative years in Iraq

32:53.205 --> 32:55.372
in the aftermath
of the Gulf war.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.691
He saw the wreckage.

32:57.692 --> 33:00.009
Yes, and he blamed it on
what he called "the oppressors."

33:00.012 --> 33:02.212
Abby:
Gibbs.

33:02.214 --> 33:05.182
This helmet totally works.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.383
I was trying
to figure out

33:06.385 --> 33:08.285
the numbers that cross
wrote on the box.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.120
So I put on the helmet,
had a drink,

33:10.122 --> 33:13.724
and it was in fact
like a boost of magic

33:13.726 --> 33:15.058
on my head.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.660
Abbs, what do the numbers mean?

33:16.662 --> 33:21.665
Well, I realized that they were
all between 118 and 136,

33:21.667 --> 33:24.701
which is the spectrum for
airport radio frequencies.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.370
If you have a
transceiver,

33:26.372 --> 33:28.271
the numbers tell you
which channel to turn on

33:28.273 --> 33:31.408
in order to hear who's
landing and who's taking off.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.243
Cross is targeting a plane.

33:33.245 --> 33:36.013
That's why he needed the xr-30,
to lock onto a moving target.

33:36.015 --> 33:38.415
Yeah, like, a really,
really fast moving target.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.483
Which airport?

33:39.485 --> 33:40.784
This grouping of frequencies

33:40.786 --> 33:44.054
matches Lafayette field
in Virginia.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.222
We've got to shut it down.

33:45.224 --> 33:46.640
Or not.

33:46.641 --> 33:48.057
If we shut it down, then cross
will know we're onto him.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.493
If we leave it open,
then we'll know

33:49.495 --> 33:51.061
where he'll be.

33:51.063 --> 33:52.129
What he said.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.131
This thing really works.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.366
McGee: Boss, range of the
xr-30 is 2,000 meters.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.979
That's a huge area to search.

33:57.980 --> 33:59.591
Gibbs:
Loop in the FBI and homeland.

33:59.592 --> 34:01.203
I want extra security,
but I don't want to see them.

34:01.206 --> 34:02.806
Gibbs, the target could be
anyone flying in or out

34:02.808 --> 34:05.142
of the airport; We have no idea
when cross will be there.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.611
Snipers-- patient and stubborn.

34:11.450 --> 34:13.517
(Indistinct radio chatter)

34:19.558 --> 34:21.625
(Distant chatter,
plane engines whirring)

34:32.104 --> 34:34.538
Talk to me, cross.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.284
Gibbs:
<i> This is my rifle.</i>

34:47.286 --> 34:50.087
<i> There are many like it;</i>
<i> This one is mine.</i>

34:51.824 --> 34:54.257
<i> My rifle is my best friend.</i>

34:54.259 --> 34:56.426
<i> It is my life.</i>

34:56.428 --> 34:59.830
<i> I must master it</i>
<i> as I must master my life.</i>

35:01.500 --> 35:04.534
<i> My rifle, without me,</i>
<i> is useless.</i>

35:06.505 --> 35:10.373
<i>Without my rifle, I am useless.</i>

35:12.311 --> 35:13.543
Bishop: Gibbs, i
have been staring

35:13.545 --> 35:15.278
at this laptop
screen for hours.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.147
Searched the flight plans
for the next two days.

35:17.149 --> 35:20.150
I still can't find any aircraft
that make sense as a target.

35:20.152 --> 35:22.352
Keep looking, bishop.

35:22.354 --> 35:23.353
(Car door closes)

35:23.355 --> 35:25.222
You're up, Tim Van winkle.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.756
It's your turn.
Get up front.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.758
I got... I got
two more minutes.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.494
Guys, something's happening.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.234
Flight plans don't have

35:37.236 --> 35:38.568
anyone leaving or arriving
for another hour.

35:38.570 --> 35:39.870
Gibbs, are you seeing this?

35:42.908 --> 35:45.208
Find out
what they're doing here.

35:45.210 --> 35:46.476
On it.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.445
Reloading the flight plans.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.381
(Beeping)

35:51.383 --> 35:52.849
One last-minute addition.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.751
Plane is seven miles away
on approach.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.753
Why didn't he file?
Didn't have to.

35:56.755 --> 35:57.721
Flying under vfr.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.489
Plane is registered to...

35:59.491 --> 36:01.691
An oil bigwig; He's named
Lamar cresset, boss.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.393
He owns a ranch nearby.

36:03.395 --> 36:04.861
Cresset's all about
his friendships

36:04.862 --> 36:06.328
in the middle eastern
oil business. Apparently...

36:06.331 --> 36:08.398
Bishop:
Cresset's the pilot.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.466
Passenger onboard is
ansaar bashaarat.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.903
Works directly under
the Saudi oil minister.

36:12.905 --> 36:14.738
Shoot bashaarat down
with a U.S. sniper rifle,

36:14.740 --> 36:16.273
all hell's gonna break loose.

36:16.275 --> 36:19.176
That's it.

36:31.456 --> 36:34.491
Okay, have the tower
deny clearance to land.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.259
Gibbs:
Give it a minute.

36:36.261 --> 36:39.829
Lining up his shot
could mean a move.

36:45.437 --> 36:46.670
I got him.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.983
Man (Over radio):
<i> We are approach clearance,</i>

36:59.985 --> 37:02.586
<i> runway 4r-22 left.</i>

37:02.588 --> 37:05.589
<i> Approach clearance,</i>
<i> runway 4r-22 left.</i>

37:09.494 --> 37:12.562
(Heart beating slowly)

37:12.564 --> 37:14.397
(Exhales)

37:14.399 --> 37:15.999
(Wind whistling softly)

37:16.001 --> 37:17.601
(Heartbeat continues)

37:19.571 --> 37:23.940
Gibbs:
<i> I must fire my rifle... true.</i>

37:23.942 --> 37:25.842
(Gunshot echoing)

37:38.824 --> 37:40.890
¶ ¶

37:52.371 --> 37:54.304
we got him.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.673
Thanks to you.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.842
My weapon?

37:58.844 --> 38:00.777
Back where it belongs.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.046
Thank you.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.881
For everything.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.017
Your team.

38:07.019 --> 38:10.654
Riley... Riley won't stop
talking about them.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.857
Says, uh... says
they're like a family.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.560
We're lucky like that.

38:17.562 --> 38:19.596
Yeah.

38:21.533 --> 38:22.565
You know,

38:22.567 --> 38:24.668
the thing is,

38:24.670 --> 38:28.638
I was fighting myself...

38:28.640 --> 38:31.641
You know, trying to be some...

38:31.643 --> 38:35.345
Empty version
of what I was before.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.683
But, uh...

38:39.685 --> 38:44.487
I think I need
to try and find...

38:46.425 --> 38:48.958
...a way to be who I am now.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.667
You know what I mean?

38:57.669 --> 38:59.736
Yeah.

39:08.347 --> 39:09.579
(Guitars playing "hallelujah")

39:09.581 --> 39:13.416
¶ I've heard there was
a secret chord ¶

39:13.418 --> 39:16.753
¶ that David played
and it pleased the lord ¶

39:16.755 --> 39:22.492
¶ you don't really care
for music, do ya? ¶

39:22.494 --> 39:26.796
¶ well, it goes like this,
the fourth, the fifth ¶

39:26.798 --> 39:30.533
¶ the minor fall,
the major lift ¶

39:30.535 --> 39:36.473
¶ the baffled king
composing hallelujah ¶

39:36.475 --> 39:40.477
¶ hallelujah ¶

39:40.479 --> 39:47.384
¶ hallelujah, hallelujah ¶

39:47.386 --> 39:53.456
¶ hallelujah... ¶

39:56.862 --> 40:00.029
you know, I was thinking
about what Riley said.

40:00.031 --> 40:03.032
You mean, uh, about
enjoying the memories?

40:03.034 --> 40:06.002
No, I guess it was more what
you said about your breakfast.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.837
And I was thinking,

40:07.839 --> 40:10.640
anyone who'd make you
a seven-layer burrito

40:10.642 --> 40:14.477
on a weekday before work--
that is love.

40:16.448 --> 40:19.582
I was thinking the same thing.

40:19.584 --> 40:20.750
Night.

40:20.752 --> 40:21.885
Night.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.721
(Computer beeping)

40:31.596 --> 40:33.630
Angelini's.

40:33.632 --> 40:34.697
Ready?

40:34.699 --> 40:36.833
Jimmy:
I feel so silly.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.502
Can't believe I'm the only one
without a motorcycle license.

40:39.504 --> 40:41.638
No matter, Mr. Palmer.

40:41.640 --> 40:45.775
Rest assured that, by my side,
you will be hauling ass.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.712
Gentlemen.

40:49.714 --> 40:50.980
Let's ride.

40:53.618 --> 40:54.951
(Engine revving)

40:55.954 --> 40:59.856
¶ Hallelujah ¶

40:59.858 --> 41:06.463
¶ hallelujah, hallelujah ¶

41:06.465 --> 41:12.969

41:17.742 --> 41:20.877

41:20.879 --> 41:24.714
