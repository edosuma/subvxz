09:39.600 --> 09:41.667
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

09:41.667 --> 09:42.967
HE'S RIGHT.

09:42.967 --> 09:44.400
MY TAKE-HOME PAY
IS SO SMALL,

09:44.400 --> 09:47.100
I WON'T EVEN BE ABLE
TO AFFORD A USED HORSE.

09:47.100 --> 09:51.200
AND I'M, LIKE, GETTING
MY LICENSE, LIKE, THIS YEAR.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.834
SHE'S A VALLEY
FORGE GIRL.

09:53.834 --> 09:55.467
AH.

09:55.467 --> 09:58.600
BOYS, YOU NEED
TO GET UPSTAIRS

09:58.600 --> 10:00.834
AND STUDY
FOR YOUR AMERICAN
HISTORY TEST TOMORROW.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.233
MOTHER, THERE
IS NO HISTORY.

10:03.233 --> 10:05.367
YESTERDAY, WE GOT
OFF THE BOAT

10:05.367 --> 10:07.500
AND TODAY,
WE BATHED IN THE CREEK.

10:08.967 --> 10:12.000
WELL, WE SHOULD
MAKE HISTORY BY REBELLING
AGAINST THE BRITISH.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.467
I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON A NEW FLAG
FOR OUR NEW COUNTRY.

10:14.467 --> 10:17.800
THIS WILL SHOW
THE BRITISH WE ARE NOT
TO BE TRIFLED WITH.

10:17.800 --> 10:21.367
DON'T TREAD ON ME.

10:21.367 --> 10:22.567
LOVE THE SAYING,

10:22.567 --> 10:25.400
BUT THE BUNNY ISN'T
EXACTLY SCARY.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.967
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A BEAR.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.600
SHH! SHH! SHH! SHH!
SHH! SHH! SHH!

10:32.600 --> 10:35.300
THERE WILL BE
NO TALK OF REVOLUTION
IN MY INN.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.934
LORD TIPTON AND
KING GEORGE ARE LIKE THIS,

10:37.934 --> 10:40.467
AND I DON'T WANT
TO END UP LIKE THIS.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.600
Esteban: FELLOW PATRIOTS.
GATHER AROUND.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.967
OK. I HEAR LORD TIPTON
HAS A BOATLOAD OF TEA

10:49.967 --> 10:51.300
COMING IN TONIGHT
FROM ENGLAND.

10:51.300 --> 10:55.300
LET'S DUMP IT
IN THE HARBOR
TO PROTEST HIGH TAXES.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.300
THE HARBOR?

10:57.300 --> 10:59.800
ISN'T THAT WHERE ALL
THOSE BRITISH SHIPS ARE

10:59.800 --> 11:02.600
WITH THE BIG GUNS
POINTING AT US?

11:03.934 --> 11:05.600
WE CAN'T
FIGHT THE CROWN.

11:05.600 --> 11:09.100
WHAT IF I WROTE
A STRONGLY-WORDED LETTER?

11:09.100 --> 11:13.367
LISTEN, QUILL BOY,
PAPER MAY BEAT ROCK,

11:13.367 --> 11:17.500
BUT CANNONBALL MAKES
HUGE HOLE IN PAPER.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.734
WELL, YOU CAN SIT HERE

11:18.734 --> 11:20.033
AND WRITE ALL
THE LETTERS YOU WANT,

11:20.033 --> 11:22.133
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO BE FREE, THEN FOLLOW ME.

11:22.133 --> 11:23.200
I'M WITH YE.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.200
GIVE ME LIBERTY...

11:24.200 --> 11:25.600
OR GIVE ME DEATH.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.033
IS THERE A THIRD CHOICE?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.600
NOW REMEMBER, DURING
OUR RAID ON THE TEA SHIP,

11:34.600 --> 11:36.600
THESE INDIAN HEADDRESSES
WILL DISGUISE US

11:36.600 --> 11:38.300
SO THE BRITISH WON'T
KNOW WHO WE ARE.

11:38.300 --> 11:39.400
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:39.400 --> 11:40.567
LOOK, GUYS.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.100
I CARE ABOUT LIBERTY AS
MUCH AS THE NEXT PERSON,

11:43.100 --> 11:46.000
BUT THERE IS A REASON
THE BRITISH RULE US.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.100
ENGLAND.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.700
US.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.467
ENGLAND.

11:51.467 --> 11:53.100
US.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.567
IT MIGHT NOT
ALWAYS BE THAT WAY.

11:55.567 --> 11:58.000
IN FACT,
I ENVISION A COUNTRY

11:58.000 --> 12:00.100
THAT WILL ONE DAY REACH
FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.934
YEAH. AND SOMEDAY MAN
WILL WALK ON THE MOON.

12:02.934 --> 12:04.100
YEAH, RIGHT.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.500
ACTUALLY,
I'M WORKING ON THAT,

12:06.500 --> 12:10.500
BUT I AM
GOING TO NEED
A VERY LONG ROPE.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.000
JUST THINK HOW WONDERFUL
IT WILL BE

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
WHEN WE'RE ALL CITIZENS
AND CAN VOTE.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.467
CAN ZACK AND I VOTE?

12:17.467 --> 12:19.000
NO. YOU'RE ONLY KIDS.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
CAN MADDIE AND I VOTE?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.567
NO. YOU'RE ONLY WOMEN.

12:21.567 --> 12:22.967
SO WHO CAN VOTE?

12:22.967 --> 12:24.133
THOSE WHO
ARE QUALIFIED TO.

12:24.133 --> 12:25.400
ME AND ARWIN.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.767
DON'T WE HAVE
ANY OTHER CHOICES?

12:29.767 --> 12:32.967
WELL, VOTING
ISN'T THE ONLY THING
WE'RE FIGHTING FOR.

12:32.967 --> 12:35.000
I'M FIGHTING
FOR FREE SPEECH.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.900
I'M FIGHTING
FOR FREE PRESS.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.100
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA. FIGHTING?

12:38.100 --> 12:40.600
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
ARTS AND CRAFTS.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.000
LOOK, GUYS.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.300
THAT ALL SOUNDS GREAT,

12:43.300 --> 12:45.133
BUT IT'S NOT
WORTH IT FOR ME

12:45.133 --> 12:47.200
TO RISK MY HIDE
FOR A CUP OF TEA.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.734
FRESH PIG'S FEET!

12:49.734 --> 12:55.767
HOG FRESH.
THEY WERE WALKING
AROUND THIS MORNING.

12:55.767 --> 12:58.400
HEY, ZACK, CAN YOU GIVE ME
A PACK OF FAT-FREE FEET?

12:58.400 --> 13:01.300
HEY, ONE PACK
OF FAT-FREE FEET

13:01.300 --> 13:02.600
AND A LARGE HOT
CHOCOLATE.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.567
THAT WILL BE
THREE POUNDS STERLING.

13:04.567 --> 13:05.600
WHAT?

13:05.600 --> 13:07.667
THAT'S TRIPLE WHAT
IT WAS YESTERDAY.

13:07.667 --> 13:11.200
SORRY, KING GEORGE HAS
RAISED THE TAX ON CHOCOLATE.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.367
[GASPS]

13:12.367 --> 13:15.000
OH, NO, HE DIDN'T.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.233
STILL THINK
IT'S NOT WORTH
FIGHTING THE CROWN?

13:18.233 --> 13:19.400
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.600
KING GEORGE HAS GONE
TOO FAR THIS TIME.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.200
GIVE ME CHOCOLATE
OR GIVE ME DEATH.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.200
[CHEERING]

13:27.867 --> 13:29.767
DEATH IS KIND
OF HARSH, ISN'T IT?

13:29.767 --> 13:32.100
TIME-OUTS CAN
BE VERY EFFECTIVE.

13:33.934 --> 13:36.100
[CHEERING]

13:37.233 --> 13:38.767
MAN, THAT WAS GREAT.

13:38.767 --> 13:40.834
I HAVEN'T HURLED
THAT MUCH STUFF

13:40.834 --> 13:43.133
SINCE I ATE MY MOTHER'S
DAY-OLD POSSUM POT PIE.

13:43.133 --> 13:45.867
WAAAH!

13:45.867 --> 13:48.367
THIS IS A GREAT DAY.

13:48.367 --> 13:49.400
WE'VE MADE HISTORY.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.467
OH, GREAT.
MORE FOR ME TO STUDY.

13:51.467 --> 13:52.667
YOU WERE THERE,

13:52.667 --> 13:55.934
AND YOU'RE STILL
PROBABLY GOING TO FAIL.

13:57.100 --> 14:00.066
AAH! INDIAN ATTACK!

14:00.066 --> 14:01.767
All: WHERE?!

14:02.600 --> 14:04.500
AAH!

14:04.500 --> 14:06.200
AAH!

14:07.734 --> 14:10.133
MOSEBY, GET RID OF THEM.

14:10.133 --> 14:12.867
BUT FIRST, BUY SOME
OF THEIR CUTE BEADS.

14:12.867 --> 14:14.233
LONDON, WE'RE NOT INDIANS.

14:14.233 --> 14:16.100
WE'RE REVOLUTIONARIES.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.600
All: YEAH!

14:17.600 --> 14:19.233
IT'S ME. MADDIE.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.467
OH, THAT EXPLAINS
WHY YOUR MOCCASINS

14:21.467 --> 14:23.200
DON'T MATCH
YOUR HEADDRESS.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.567
WE JUST DUMPED ALL THE ENGLISH
TEA INTO THE HARBOR.

14:26.567 --> 14:27.934
All: HARBOR!

14:27.934 --> 14:29.767
AND A BOX
OF HOT CHOCOLATE.

14:29.767 --> 14:31.100
All: CHOCOLATE!

14:31.100 --> 14:32.600
ALTHOUGH I SAVED
ONE PACKET.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.800
HOW DARE YE!

14:33.800 --> 14:35.233
THAT WAS
MY DADDY'S SHIP.

14:35.233 --> 14:38.100
OH, DEAR.
I COULD LOSE MY JOB.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.800
AND I COULD LOSE
MY ALLOWANCE.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.900
WELL,
TO BECOME A CITIZEN
OF THIS NEW COUNTRY,

14:41.900 --> 14:44.100
WE WILL ALL HAVE
TO MAKE SACRIFICES.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.900
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND SOME THINGS ARE
WORTH FIGHTING FOR.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.033
[BELL RINGS]

14:48.033 --> 14:50.500
YOU GUYS,
THE TOWN CRIER IS HERE.

14:50.500 --> 14:53.867
[BELL RINGS]

14:53.867 --> 14:55.667
WHAT NEWS HAVE YOU,
TOWN CRIER?

14:55.667 --> 14:58.100
NOTHING'S GOING RIGHT.

14:59.467 --> 15:01.400
MY COW RAN DRY,

15:01.400 --> 15:03.300
MY WOODEN TEETH
HAVE TERMITES,

15:03.300 --> 15:08.734
AND MY GIRLFRIEND LEFT ME
FOR THE VILLAGE FOOL.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.033
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

15:15.033 --> 15:18.367
I DIDN'T EVEN RUN
FOR FOOL THIS YEAR.

15:18.367 --> 15:21.000
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.834
WE JUST WON
THE REVOLUTION.

15:23.834 --> 15:26.233
[CHEERING]

15:26.233 --> 15:27.967
WOW, THAT WAS FAST.

15:27.967 --> 15:30.200
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
THIS IS A DREAM.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.700
IT IS?

15:34.734 --> 15:37.100
YEAH. IT BETTER BE.

15:37.100 --> 15:41.200
NEXT TIME, COULD YOU
DREAM I WAS A VIKING?

15:44.967 --> 15:46.900
All: WHOA!

15:52.300 --> 15:55.667
LITTLE BOB PEEP
HAS LOST HIS SHEEP.

16:00.734 --> 16:02.300
ZACK, WAKE UP.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.200
ZACK! ZACK!

16:04.200 --> 16:06.033
AAH!

16:06.033 --> 16:08.033
OH, MAN.

16:08.033 --> 16:11.367
I CAN NEVER WEAR
PASTELS AROUND YOU.

16:11.367 --> 16:13.133
HOW LONG WAS I ASLEEP?

16:13.133 --> 16:16.133
LONG ENOUGH FOR ME
TO RUN ACROSS THE STREET
TO CITY HALL,

16:16.133 --> 16:19.300
READ THEM MY LETTER,
AND HAVE THEM LAUGH
IN MY FACE.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.467
YOU WERE RIGHT.

16:20.467 --> 16:22.900
THERE'S NO USE
IN FIGHTING CITY HALL.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.100
NO. I WAS WRONG.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.867
YOU CAN FIGHT CITY HALL.

16:26.867 --> 16:28.600
DUDE, PICK A SIDE.

16:30.233 --> 16:33.000
I JUST HAD A DREAM
THAT TAUGHT ME TWO THINGS.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.467
NO MATTER
HOW SMALL YOU ARE,

16:34.467 --> 16:36.934
IF YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR
SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE IN,
YOU CAN WIN.

16:36.934 --> 16:38.400
WHAT'S THE SECOND THING?

16:38.400 --> 16:42.100
BOB LOOKS TERRIBLE
IN PETTICOATS.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.200
WAIT A SECOND.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.967
I JUST THOUGHT
OF A WAY TO SAVE
OUR PARK.

16:47.967 --> 16:50.934
COULD THEY TEAR IT DOWN
IF IT HAS HISTORICAL
SIGNIFICANCE?

16:50.934 --> 16:52.033
PROBABLY NOT.

16:52.033 --> 16:53.667
BUT YOUR 360
DOUBLE KEG FLIP

16:53.667 --> 16:56.033
OVER THE WATER FOUNTAIN
DOESN'T COUNT.

16:56.033 --> 16:57.934
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.600
AND BY THE WAY,
IT SHOULD COUNT.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.800
NOW, COME ON.

17:03.934 --> 17:05.700
ESTEBAN, DON'T WORRY.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.200
YOU'RE GOING TO DO
GREAT ON THE TEST.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.667
OK, OK.
REMIND ME AGAIN.

17:08.667 --> 17:10.200
WHAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S
CABINET?

17:10.200 --> 17:11.734
OH, THAT'S EASY.

17:11.734 --> 17:14.734
THAT'S WHERE
MRS. PRESIDENT KEEPS ALL
THE CLEANING SUPPLIES.

17:16.100 --> 17:18.400
IGNORE HER AND
YOU'LL DO FINE.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.300
IT'S OK.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.000
I HAVE
MY LUCKY RABBIT'S FOOT,

17:22.000 --> 17:23.500
ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T
LUCKY FOR THE RABBIT.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.567
[CHUCKLES] ESTEBAN
DOESN'T NEED ANY HELP.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.567
YOU ARE GOING
TO BE JUST FINE.

17:32.767 --> 17:35.500
MR. MOSEBY, WHERE'S
THAT OLD PAINTING?

17:35.500 --> 17:38.700
HANGING PROUDLY
ON THE WALL, WHERE IT
WILL STAY FOREVER MORE.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.400
OR NOT.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.467
D-D-DON'T TAKE
IT DOWN, PLEASE.

17:42.467 --> 17:44.300
NO, YOU CAN'T STAND
BEHIND THE DESK.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.133
OK. THAT'S IT.
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.400
YOU SEE THIS LITTLE
TREE IN THE BACK
OF THE OLD TIPTON INN?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.567
MM-HMM.

17:49.567 --> 17:51.400
THAT GREW
INTO THE BIG TREE
IN OUR PARK.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.100
THAT'S WHERE THEY PLANNED
THE BOSTON TEA PARTY.

17:53.100 --> 17:55.934
THAT MUST BE WHY THEY
NAMED IT LIBERTY PARK.

17:55.934 --> 17:58.467
THAT TREE'S
A HISTORICAL LANDMARK,

17:58.467 --> 18:00.300
SO THEY CAN'T TEAR IT DOWN.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.100
CODY, YOU'RE A GENIUS.

18:02.100 --> 18:03.600
HOW DID YOU
FIGURE ALL THAT OUT?

18:03.600 --> 18:05.400
ZACK FIGURED IT OUT.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.100
NO. SERIOUSLY.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.200
I HAVE MY MOMENTS.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.767
NOW, PLEASE GO DOWN
TO CITY HALL

18:12.767 --> 18:14.100
AND GET THEM TO STOP
THE BULLDOZERS.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.100
YOU WANT AN INJUNCTION?

18:15.100 --> 18:16.400
OH, NO. I HATE NEEDLES.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.300
JUST GO GET THEM
TO STOP IT.

18:18.300 --> 18:21.400
MADDIE AND LONDON,
I NEED YOU TO ALERT
THE MEDIA.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.934
WELL, HOW DO
I GET THEIR ATTENTION?

18:22.934 --> 18:24.100
HELLO?

18:24.100 --> 18:25.300
I WALK OUTSIDE.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.900
AND OUTSIDE
WOULD BE THAT WAY.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.400
WHEN YOU THROW IT,

18:29.400 --> 18:30.934
IT MAKES A STREAMER
LIKE AN ASTEROID.

18:30.934 --> 18:33.567
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S ALL
THE HUB-BUB, BUBS?

18:33.567 --> 18:35.867
ZACK FIGURED OUT
A WAY TO SAVE THE PARK.

18:35.867 --> 18:38.600
Both: NO. SERIOUSLY.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.133
YOU KNOW, I WISH YOU PEOPLE
WOULD REALIZE

18:40.133 --> 18:42.467
THAT I'M A THOUGHTFUL
AND INTELLIGENT PERSON.

18:42.467 --> 18:43.800
I REALIZE THAT, HONEY.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.367
NOW, WE'RE GOING TO GO LIE DOWN
IN FRONT OF THE BULLDOZERS.

18:46.367 --> 18:48.300
AND I SPOKE TOO SOON.

18:50.233 --> 18:53.567
DON'T MESS WITH ME
OR THE TREE OF LIBERTY!

18:53.567 --> 18:56.734
DON'T MESS WITH ME
OR THE TREE OF LIBERTY!

18:56.734 --> 18:58.367
OH, NO.
