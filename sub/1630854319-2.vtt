I just want to tell you
I love your show.

00:08.407 --> 00:10.143
Thank you so much.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.212
I have a question
for the dancer, actually.

00:11.246 --> 00:13.350
-Yes.
-Hi.

00:13.384 --> 00:15.388
-Hi. How you doin'?
-Um, you say
you've done one film?

00:15.421 --> 00:17.157
-Yes.
-Yeah, was that the one

00:17.190 --> 00:18.560
in which you're dressed
as a sheepdog

00:18.594 --> 00:20.498
and lick a little boy's
unwiped tushy

00:20.531 --> 00:22.167
-in a film called Sadie?
-(laughing)

00:22.200 --> 00:24.839
-No, not at all.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

00:24.873 --> 00:26.243

01:16.042 --> 01:18.580
Oh. That must be
really hot, still.

01:18.614 --> 01:20.351
I don't know why
I sterilize the needles.

01:20.384 --> 01:23.022
It's... an old habit.

01:23.056 --> 01:25.060
(muffled yelling)

01:25.093 --> 01:27.064
I'm going to lift your arms

01:27.097 --> 01:29.302
until the shoulder joints
dislocate.

01:29.335 --> 01:31.172
You will feel it.

01:31.205 --> 01:33.243
-The Vietcong perfected that.
-(loud, muffled groaning)

01:33.277 --> 01:35.381
Stop moving.

01:35.414 --> 01:37.852
-I don't want any fluids
on this carpet.
-(groans)

01:37.885 --> 01:40.925
I can tell from your face
that you're angry,

01:40.958 --> 01:44.566
scared, in pain.

01:44.599 --> 01:46.570
The others were, too.

01:46.603 --> 01:48.440
There's a lot of pain in us.

01:48.474 --> 01:50.478
I want to make that legible.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.582
I made some mistakes by removing

01:52.615 --> 01:54.986
things from the others.

01:55.019 --> 01:56.890
They were just bodies.

01:56.923 --> 01:59.161
I need to give them people.

01:59.194 --> 02:00.631
Homosexuals are central

02:00.664 --> 02:02.335
to the natural order of things.

02:02.368 --> 02:04.672
And you will be a totem to that.

02:04.706 --> 02:06.910
They think we bleed differently.

02:06.943 --> 02:08.547
But we're all the same.

02:08.580 --> 02:11.353
And they will see the blood.

02:11.386 --> 02:13.957
There's a war that's coming.

02:13.991 --> 02:16.296
It will fix some things.

02:18.967 --> 02:21.406
Oh, no.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.243
No, no, no, that won't do.

02:23.277 --> 02:26.082
A fellow brother-in-arms.

02:26.115 --> 02:29.355
You can't serve twice.

02:29.389 --> 02:32.995
I'm going to put you
back to sleep.

02:33.029 --> 02:34.499
You'll wake up.

02:34.532 --> 02:36.369
You can tell the police
all about me,

02:36.403 --> 02:38.206
but they'll do nothing.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.244
They don't want to.

02:40.277 --> 02:42.548
If they haven't
caught me by now...

The ones that

which is what I've been doing
for three weeks.

05:19.551 --> 05:21.822

is sexually transmitted

John Sullivan.

and some of them
I know really well.

08:45.997 --> 08:47.567
If I hadn't been spared,

08:47.600 --> 08:49.939
would they have even
looked into my death?

08:50.739 --> 08:54.013
Risked outing themselves by
demanding answers, or would they

08:54.047 --> 08:56.251
just have gone on
with their lives?

08:56.284 --> 08:58.322
"Whatever that gay guy
got mixed up in

08:58.355 --> 09:00.493
must have gotten him killed."

09:00.526 --> 09:02.497
But I woke up.

09:02.530 --> 09:04.400
I am alive.

09:04.434 --> 09:06.973
And I will do whatever I can.

09:07.740 --> 09:10.246
I will sit in front of this

09:10.279 --> 09:12.517
pathetic, shitty typewriter,

have to have a long think

gather, I guess.

on what's really happening.

09:58.509 --> 10:00.179

and-and we record it.

top choice for the cover art.

12:33.385 --> 12:35.489
It's a full page,
and he said to remind you to

12:35.522 --> 12:36.891
"make it fucking sexy."

12:36.926 --> 12:39.163
GINO:
Make it sexy.

12:40.232 --> 12:42.336
Boring.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.207
This fucking queen.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.311
No.

12:48.448 --> 12:49.918
She makes me smile.

12:49.952 --> 12:52.356
Not one woman in his picks.

12:52.390 --> 12:54.460
I guess she doesn't count, huh?

12:59.270 --> 13:00.907
All right, here's an idea.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.944
I have to do
a double issue for Pride

13:02.978 --> 13:04.714
because it brings in
advertisers,

13:04.747 --> 13:06.384
but I do not want to do it.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.422
How about this?
You three--

13:08.455 --> 13:11.861
you take that dusty little desk
over there and do your thing.

13:11.896 --> 13:14.767
You can rail
about the stalled ERA,

13:14.801 --> 13:18.542
pap smears, male-only gay bars--
I don't care--

13:18.575 --> 13:20.379
whatever blows your skirt up.

13:20.412 --> 13:22.516
Please just stay out of my face.

13:22.550 --> 13:24.955
(laughs)
Mmm.

13:24.988 --> 13:27.393
Jesus. Go.

13:27.426 --> 13:29.932
(laughing)

13:32.971 --> 13:35.409
Can I get a Coke or something?

13:37.313 --> 13:40.419
We've been here for hours.
I got to use the bathroom, too.

13:40.452 --> 13:42.323
Please.

13:42.356 --> 13:43.960
Why did you give an interview

13:43.993 --> 13:46.398
to that faggot reporter?

13:46.431 --> 13:48.468
You have a thing against cops?
You, uh,

13:48.502 --> 13:50.539
trying to make us look bad?

13:50.572 --> 13:53.946
You get busted sucking dick
in the Rambles

13:53.980 --> 13:55.616
one time too many?

13:55.649 --> 13:57.453
I personally took your statement
about your friend.

13:58.855 --> 14:01.027
Does that sound like
the cops not caring?

14:01.060 --> 14:03.432
Huh? You told me.
You stated in that article

14:03.465 --> 14:06.037
that your friend was attacked
by some big leather guy.

14:06.070 --> 14:07.908
That makes no sense.

14:07.941 --> 14:11.815
The men in that community are
usually harmless and benign.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.591
After all the shit we put up
with protecting your people!

14:16.624 --> 14:18.695
Hey! Hey, I'm allowed
to say what I want to say

14:18.728 --> 14:20.299
without getting
harassed or detained.

14:20.332 --> 14:21.969
Yeah, he's right. He's right.

14:22.002 --> 14:25.476
We are sworn officers
of the law.

14:25.509 --> 14:28.415
We are constrained
by the limits of the law.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.484

14:52.396 --> 14:54.367
MULCAHEY:
You better call
that reporter back

14:54.400 --> 14:55.736
and tell him
you were wrong about us.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.039
Fuck you.

14:57.072 --> 14:59.377

Tell him you lied for attention.

14:59.410 --> 15:01.481
Fuck you! Fuck you!

15:01.514 --> 15:02.984
Okay.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.054
How long are you going
to keep me in here?

15:21.087 --> 15:24.026
Well, the boss wanted to lose
your file and let you rot.

15:25.930 --> 15:28.001
I'll let you out soon.

15:49.477 --> 15:51.047
Anyone here know about you?

15:53.018 --> 15:55.088
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.593
Right.

15:59.030 --> 16:01.134
-Do you still have my card?
-Mm-hmm.

16:01.167 --> 16:02.670
You do?

16:02.703 --> 16:04.473
If you see
or hear anything out there,

16:04.507 --> 16:05.977
you call me directly.

16:06.010 --> 16:08.548
I'm working on something here,
but quietly.

16:08.582 --> 16:10.852
And stay off the streets, okay?

16:10.886 --> 16:12.556
I don't want to hear a story
about you getting shot

16:12.590 --> 16:14.527
in the back
running away from cops.

16:24.747 --> 16:27.720
Gino, hi. Uh, excuse me.
I need to talk to you

16:27.753 --> 16:29.857
-about something important.
-Why would I
want to talk to you?

16:29.890 --> 16:31.594
You've made Patrick's life
a living hell.

16:31.628 --> 16:33.498
Oh, well, I'm sorry
if I got a little mad sometimes.

16:33.531 --> 16:35.102
I guess living with someone
who lies to you

16:35.135 --> 16:37.539
with every breath can make
a woman a little unstable.

16:38.508 --> 16:40.980
-What do you want?
-Are-are you okay?

16:41.014 --> 16:43.718
What happened? Did you get into
an accident or something?

16:43.752 --> 16:45.589
(clears throat)

16:46.624 --> 16:48.161
I read your article.

16:48.194 --> 16:49.664
-Oh, you read The Native?
-Yes.

16:49.697 --> 16:51.668
I live in the fucking Village.

16:51.701 --> 16:54.006
Do you really think
there's a killer out there?

16:54.040 --> 16:56.144
I know there is.

16:56.177 --> 16:58.014
You don't have to worry.
He just likes killing boys.

16:58.048 --> 17:00.152
Yeah, for now.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.489
So, I've just been clearing out
the rest of Patrick's things.

17:02.523 --> 17:05.028
You know, the owner lets us
store stuff in the basement,

17:05.062 --> 17:07.866
and, uh, I found this box hidden
under some of his other things,

17:07.901 --> 17:09.905
so...

17:09.938 --> 17:12.710
Is this the kind of thing
you two like to do?

17:15.984 --> 17:17.954
Oh, is that what this is?

17:17.988 --> 17:21.761
This is you trying to trick me
into talking about our sex life.

17:21.794 --> 17:23.765
Okay, no, that's not it at all.

17:23.798 --> 17:26.170
Okay? These things scared me.

17:26.204 --> 17:29.110
Now, I told you that Patrick
is a very good liar.

17:29.143 --> 17:31.514
And if he lied to me,
he could be lying to you.

17:31.547 --> 17:33.051
He could be lying to everyone.

17:33.084 --> 17:34.955
Your jealously has just...
it's made you paranoid.

17:35.957 --> 17:38.628
Oh, you didn't know
about this, did you?

17:41.701 --> 17:43.805
I got to go.

17:47.212 --> 17:49.216
Thanks for picking me up.

17:49.250 --> 17:52.189
I wanted a witness so they know
someone knows I was there.

17:52.222 --> 17:54.060
Thought I was gonna
have to bail you out.

17:54.093 --> 17:56.064
No, they didn't even
charge me with anything.

17:56.097 --> 17:58.234
These psycho cops
just brought me in

17:58.268 --> 18:00.806
and roughed me up
for hurting their feelings.

18:00.839 --> 18:02.142
This city's gone insane.

18:02.176 --> 18:03.878
The cops are just as bad
as the criminals.

18:03.913 --> 18:05.716
It was always like that.

18:05.749 --> 18:07.753
You were just too white
to notice.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.724
Enough with this doom and gloom.

18:09.757 --> 18:11.627
Summer is here. Lighten up.

18:11.661 --> 18:13.732
You should come out
with me tonight.

18:13.765 --> 18:16.604
There's a party.
It will blow your mind.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.141
It's in the most run-down part
of the city.

18:18.174 --> 18:19.810
Why would I want
to go somewhere like that?

18:19.844 --> 18:21.581
It's not what you think.

18:21.614 --> 18:23.818
This rich queen bought
a big old warehouse down there

18:23.852 --> 18:26.224
where they used to store stuff
before loading it on to ships.

18:26.257 --> 18:28.228
-Uh-huh.
-He throws these wild parties.

18:28.261 --> 18:30.298
Everyone gets all dressed up
in costumes,

18:30.332 --> 18:33.171

and poetry readings.

18:33.204 --> 18:35.008
Real Parisian shit.

18:35.042 --> 18:38.114
He likes the contrast of
the decadence with the squalor.

18:38.148 --> 18:39.985
He sounds like an asshole.

18:40.018 --> 18:41.721

36:55.909 --> 36:58.680
STEWART:
Get me the fuck out of here.

36:58.714 --> 37:00.284
Keep screaming like that,

37:00.317 --> 37:02.755
you're gonna fuck up
that perfect little throat.

37:06.263 --> 37:08.200
Hey, hey, hey.

37:08.233 --> 37:11.339
If I told you once,
I've told you a dozen times.

37:11.373 --> 37:14.045
It only hurts if you fight it.

37:14.078 --> 37:16.683
Where the hell were you?

37:16.716 --> 37:18.687
How could you just
leave me like this?

37:18.720 --> 37:20.090
Answer to question number one:

37:20.124 --> 37:22.930
none of your fucking business.

37:22.963 --> 37:26.369
Answer to question number two:

37:26.403 --> 37:28.841
how else did you want me
to leave you?

37:28.874 --> 37:30.344
-You're a sick fuck.
-I didn't do anything

37:30.377 --> 37:32.114
to you
you didn't absolutely love,

37:32.148 --> 37:33.717
and we both know that.

37:33.750 --> 37:35.454
-Well, I'm done.
-Oh.

37:35.487 --> 37:38.694
You're done
when I say you're done.

37:38.727 --> 37:40.731
(laughing)

37:42.235 --> 37:44.038
No, no.

37:44.072 --> 37:47.078
Stewie, baby,
you're just getting started.

37:47.111 --> 37:49.249
-(chains jangling)
-Let me out of here.

37:49.282 --> 37:51.786
Help!

37:51.820 --> 37:54.125
Somebody help me!

37:54.158 --> 37:56.062
Somebody!

37:56.096 --> 37:58.333
Please.
I didn't want this.

37:58.367 --> 38:00.371
I'm not enjoying it.

38:02.842 --> 38:04.412
You did answer a pay phone
on the street

38:04.445 --> 38:07.218
in front of a leather club,
did you not?

38:07.251 --> 38:10.291
So you knew exactly what
you were getting into, right?

38:10.324 --> 38:12.028
And you loved
every single second of it,

38:12.061 --> 38:13.830
didn't you, you little freak?

38:15.100 --> 38:17.104
You're fucking hot
when you're scared.

38:21.846 --> 38:23.450
Let's have some fun.

38:27.758 --> 38:30.030
(siren wailing in distance)

38:30.064 --> 38:32.101
(grunts softly)

38:50.037 --> 38:52.742
-I can't sleep.
-Neither can I.

38:52.775 --> 38:55.447
Yeah, why not-- all the noise?

38:55.481 --> 38:57.920
(chuckles): Noise?

38:57.953 --> 39:00.391
Nobody who grew up in the city
hears noise.

39:01.359 --> 39:02.428
No.

39:03.463 --> 39:04.934
It's the silence.

39:04.967 --> 39:07.171
It's everywhere.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.411
Oh, Jesus, Patrick.

39:10.444 --> 39:12.481
Another killing.

39:12.515 --> 39:14.285
Few feet away from us.

39:14.319 --> 39:16.056
Cops show up, do nothing.

39:16.089 --> 39:18.193
A miniature paper umbrella
on the floor

39:18.226 --> 39:19.997
doesn't really
give us much to go on.

39:20.030 --> 39:22.802
Plus, there was no drugs
in his drink,

39:22.835 --> 39:25.741
unlike what happened
to you, so...

39:28.513 --> 39:30.451
Thank you
for saying it out loud.

39:31.486 --> 39:34.492
We still haven't
really talked about it.

39:34.525 --> 39:37.431
Just more silence.

39:37.465 --> 39:39.202
As if it never happened.

39:39.235 --> 39:41.473
That terrifies me.

39:43.276 --> 39:46.049
'Cause you know
what all this quiet means?

39:47.885 --> 39:50.024
Secrets.

39:52.128 --> 39:54.866
You're the quietest one of all.

39:57.104 --> 39:59.342
(phone ringing)

40:01.613 --> 40:03.183
PATRICK:
Yeah.

40:03.216 --> 40:05.821
Okay, I'll be right there.

40:10.230 --> 40:11.533
They found something.

40:11.566 --> 40:13.804
♪ ♪

40:34.579 --> 40:36.883
(indistinct chatter)

40:36.917 --> 40:38.487
MAZARA:
All right, that makes sense.
Thank you.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.524
Hey, Chief, what's going on?

40:40.557 --> 40:42.294
Hey. So, uh,
you might have been right.

40:42.328 --> 40:44.298
Looks like your faggot killer
left us something new.

40:44.332 --> 40:46.169
Where's the body?

40:46.202 --> 40:48.173
Actually, we didn't
get a main course.

40:48.206 --> 40:49.542
We got an assortment.

40:49.575 --> 40:51.613
(camera shutter clicking)

40:54.685 --> 40:56.456
Holy shit.

40:56.489 --> 40:58.160
Looks like each one
is from a different victim.
