WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:04.091
I say that I do
the terrible things I do

00:04.093 --> 00:07.416
because I couldn't find
who killed Sarah and Teddy.

00:07.417 --> 00:08.480
But I lied.

00:08.481 --> 00:09.681
Truth is...

00:09.683 --> 00:11.649
I like
doing these things,

00:11.651 --> 00:13.318
and I don't want to stop.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.053
Even if you could
force me out,

00:15.055 --> 00:16.387
what do you think
I'd leave behind?

00:16.389 --> 00:18.923
You'd be nothing
but blood and bone.

00:18.925 --> 00:21.292
Then we don't
kick him out. We keep him in.

00:23.963 --> 00:25.496
It's just you.

00:27.860 --> 00:30.261
- Michael's all locked up.
- Seems that way.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.429
Do you remember visiting
my reading room?

00:32.430 --> 00:34.565
The shelves and shelves
of notebooks

00:34.567 --> 00:36.667
describing the ways
you might die?

00:36.669 --> 00:39.069
They all end
the same way now --

00:39.071 --> 00:40.504
except one.

00:40.506 --> 00:42.139
What am I supposed to do
with this?

00:42.141 --> 00:44.308
That's up to you.

00:51.083 --> 00:55.920
Never been caught
by a human before.

00:55.922 --> 00:58.989
You some kind of Hunter?

00:58.991 --> 01:01.725
No.
No, I know a couple.

01:01.727 --> 01:05.763
Picked up some tricks.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.567
And a few other things.

01:09.569 --> 01:13.237
Well, if you're not a Hunter,
let's make a deal.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.405
Mnh-mnh.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.740
No deals.

01:16.742 --> 01:19.543
What do you want?

01:19.545 --> 01:21.712
Abraxas.

01:21.714 --> 01:23.314
Yeah,
the last demon I killed

01:23.316 --> 01:27.117
said you and Abraxas
made quite the team

01:27.119 --> 01:29.920
until he was captured
by a Hunter.

01:29.922 --> 01:32.623
You left your pal
in the lurch,

01:32.625 --> 01:34.525
but you know
who got him.

01:34.527 --> 01:36.460
If I was there.

01:38.097 --> 01:41.932
The Hunter who caught him,
who almost got me --

01:41.934 --> 01:44.134
why would I
protect them?

01:44.136 --> 01:47.438
Hell, I can even tell you
where to find 'em.

01:47.440 --> 01:53.344
So...no need
for any of this.

01:53.346 --> 01:55.012
Oh,
I don't know.

01:55.014 --> 01:56.614
Where's the fun
in that?

01:56.616 --> 01:58.215
Hibbing!

01:58.217 --> 02:02.553
She's in
Hibbing, Minnesota.

How you feeling?

02:59.812 --> 03:01.045
What you reading?

03:01.047 --> 03:02.913
Uh, going back through
the Book of Jubilees.

03:02.915 --> 03:05.649
You know, the way
they classify angels is -- is --

03:05.651 --> 03:06.884
it's really interesting.

03:06.886 --> 03:08.185
Find anything
on Michael?

03:08.187 --> 03:10.354
Not yet, but I -- but I --
but I just started.

03:14.327 --> 03:17.194
We'll find a way.

03:17.196 --> 03:19.630
Man, I-I-I...

03:19.632 --> 03:24.101
I appreciate it,
you know, you...trying.

03:24.103 --> 03:25.703
Well, yeah.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.171
Of course.

03:27.173 --> 03:30.207
I mean, always.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.109
You want to hop in,
help out?

03:32.111 --> 03:33.877
I got plenty
to go through.

03:33.879 --> 03:35.312
Actually, I-I -- I thought

03:35.314 --> 03:36.847
I'd go for a --
a drive, you know?

03:36.849 --> 03:39.583
Just me and Baby,
long stretch of road.

03:39.585 --> 03:42.086
And figured
I'd make it a twofer --

03:42.088 --> 03:45.823
I'd go see Mom
at, uh, Donna's cabin.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.157
Yeah.

03:47.159 --> 03:49.727
Yeah,
Th-that sounds great.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.662
Be good
to see 'em.

03:51.664 --> 03:53.597
Just let me, uh,
find a stopping point

03:53.599 --> 03:54.965
and get packed up.

03:54.967 --> 03:57.935
Uh, actually, I was, uh...

03:57.937 --> 03:59.136
was kind of hoping for

03:59.138 --> 04:01.205
some one-on-one time
with Mom,

04:01.207 --> 04:02.806
if that's cool.

04:06.012 --> 04:10.547
Ye-- uh...Sure, yeah.

04:10.549 --> 04:13.117
Whatever you need.

04:17.456 --> 04:20.824
Okay.

04:26.232 --> 04:28.632
Take care, Sammy.

04:34.206 --> 04:36.740
Yeah,
he called last night.

04:36.742 --> 04:38.175
Said it was just
a supply run,

04:38.177 --> 04:40.744
but I'll take any excuse
for a visit.

04:40.746 --> 04:43.414
Cabin's been
a little quiet lately.

04:43.416 --> 04:44.581
Quiet?

04:44.583 --> 04:47.184
Yeah, uh,
Bobby took off for a few days.

04:47.186 --> 04:48.485
It's fine.

04:48.487 --> 04:51.555
Just after everything
that happened with his son,

04:51.557 --> 04:54.558
we needed
a little space.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.760
Yeah.

04:58.264 --> 04:59.463
Sam?

04:59.465 --> 05:01.632
Sorry, I'm just --
I'm worried, you know?

05:01.634 --> 05:03.467
Ever since
we locked Michael up,

05:03.469 --> 05:05.035
Dean's been
acting strange,

05:05.037 --> 05:06.770
and he just packed up
and left,

05:06.772 --> 05:08.672
and then, uh...

05:08.674 --> 05:10.174
And what?

05:10.176 --> 05:12.142
He hugged me.

05:12.144 --> 05:14.445
That's sweet.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.280
Mom,
we don't hug.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.881
I mean, w-we do,

05:17.883 --> 05:21.819
but only if it's literally
the end of the world, you know?

05:21.821 --> 05:23.287
Sam,
he'll be here soon.

05:23.289 --> 05:24.922
I'll look after him.

05:24.924 --> 05:27.224
- I'll get to the bottom of this.
- Yeah, all right.

05:27.226 --> 05:29.159
M-Maybe it's like you said,
you know?

05:29.161 --> 05:32.329
Maybe he just need some space,
like Bobby.

05:32.331 --> 05:33.430
Yeah.

05:33.432 --> 05:34.832
Well, and until
we know for sure,

05:34.834 --> 05:36.033
we have to
respect that.

05:36.035 --> 05:37.801
Yeah, you're right.
Uh, I -- I...

05:39.672 --> 05:41.638
Yeah, uh...

05:41.640 --> 05:43.173
talk soon.

05:55.754 --> 05:57.321
Mmm. Oh, my God.

05:57.323 --> 05:58.922
What?
You thought I was joking?

06:01.227 --> 06:03.460
Best burger
in Minnesota.

06:03.462 --> 06:04.661
Best burger ever.

06:04.663 --> 06:06.964
- Glad it satisfied.
- Oh.

06:06.966 --> 06:10.167
So good.

06:10.169 --> 06:13.504
So, Dean.

06:13.506 --> 06:15.572
Have you seen
Jody lately, hm?

06:15.574 --> 06:16.840
The girls?

06:16.842 --> 06:18.075
Oh, yeah.

06:18.077 --> 06:22.079
You know,
I split my time as much I can,

06:22.081 --> 06:24.214
help Jody
with their training.

06:24.216 --> 06:25.949
Last month,
we took down a Vetala nest.

06:25.951 --> 06:27.232
Mm-hmm.

06:27.256 --> 06:29.554
Alex, little miss
"I don't want to Hunt"?

06:29.555 --> 06:31.288
She killed two
all by herself.

06:31.290 --> 06:33.223
Get out of town.

06:33.225 --> 06:34.925
Good for her.

06:36.529 --> 06:37.961
Anyhoo...

06:37.963 --> 06:39.696
Now, what about you?

06:39.698 --> 06:41.131
How's sheriffing going?

06:41.133 --> 06:43.700
I know it was a little tough
last time, what with, uh...

06:43.702 --> 06:45.102
- Doug, yeah.
- Yeah.

06:45.104 --> 06:46.937
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

06:46.939 --> 06:51.175
Yeah, you know,
the split was rough.

06:52.778 --> 06:55.979
Doug's working
private security now,

06:55.981 --> 06:57.281
up in Duluth.

06:57.283 --> 07:00.551
Okay.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.819
Any more questions?

07:02.821 --> 07:04.521
Huh?

07:04.523 --> 07:05.889
Just wondering

07:05.891 --> 07:08.058
if you've run out of ways
to ask me how I'm doing,

07:08.060 --> 07:11.461
so as to avoid me
repaying the favor.

07:12.431 --> 07:16.033
I know you were
just possessed, again.

07:17.469 --> 07:19.269
Sam.

07:19.271 --> 07:20.537
He had us all out
looking for you.

07:20.539 --> 07:21.972
And I know
you got an archangel

07:21.974 --> 07:24.007
hitching a ride
up there in your noggin.

07:25.144 --> 07:26.082
Also Sam.

07:26.106 --> 07:27.979
What, does he got
a freakin' newsletter?

07:27.980 --> 07:29.846
I'm just saying,
all that,

07:29.848 --> 07:32.049
it can't be easy,
you know?

07:38.424 --> 07:41.391
Well...

07:41.393 --> 07:44.261
I'll make it through,
okay?

07:45.497 --> 07:47.497
That's all we can do,
right?

07:48.434 --> 07:50.133
Right.

07:50.135 --> 07:53.270
Couldn't come through town
without seeing my D-train,

07:53.272 --> 07:54.771
so thanks
for meeting me.

07:54.773 --> 07:56.707
Oh, yeah.

07:56.709 --> 07:58.875
Come here.

07:58.877 --> 08:01.111
Oh.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.312
Ohh.

08:02.314 --> 08:04.481
You betcha.

08:07.219 --> 08:09.953
I'll see ya,
Donna.

08:47.526 --> 08:48.792
Hey, Mom.

08:48.794 --> 08:51.328
You're here.

08:53.799 --> 08:56.733
Yeah. Thought I'd stick around
for a couple days, if that's cool.

08:56.735 --> 08:57.968
Of course.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.170
Uh,
Bobby's gone.

09:00.172 --> 09:03.073
We have a big couch
and a pull-out.

09:03.075 --> 09:04.408
- Perfect.
- Awesome.

09:04.410 --> 09:07.711
You know, if you wanted
to make it a full reunion,

09:07.713 --> 09:09.413
we could
call Sam over.

09:09.415 --> 09:11.515
Yeah, you know,
I was thinking

09:11.517 --> 09:13.884
I'd actually be a little greedy
with my Mom time,

09:13.886 --> 09:15.752
if that's cool.

09:15.754 --> 09:18.088
Well, I just thought, you know,
if you're staying a few nights...

09:18.090 --> 09:19.690
I don't want Sam here.

09:20.959 --> 09:22.726
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, no.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.028
You know what? I just --
I'm -- I'm hangry, okay?

09:25.030 --> 09:27.964
Long drive,
haven't eaten,

09:27.966 --> 09:31.335
and, uh, I'm starving,
actually.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.937
Well, uh,
the delivery options

09:33.939 --> 09:35.272
are a little limited
this far out,

09:35.274 --> 09:38.875
and we both know
I'm not much of a cook.

09:38.877 --> 09:40.944
Well, there's one thing
you can cook

09:40.946 --> 09:43.246
better than anybody
on the planet.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.922
Winchester Surprise?

09:51.924 --> 09:53.423
Yeah.

09:53.425 --> 09:54.858
I can't believe
you remember that.

09:54.860 --> 09:58.228
I can't believe I ever fed that
to you and John.

09:58.230 --> 10:01.298
It was so greasy,
like...

10:01.300 --> 10:03.233
Heart attack
on a plate.

10:03.235 --> 10:05.635
A delicious heart attack
on a plate, okay?

10:05.637 --> 10:08.905
I would like mine
with extra cheese.

10:10.409 --> 10:12.342
All right,
then.

10:12.344 --> 10:14.378
Yes.

10:15.314 --> 10:16.813
Oh, and, uh...

10:16.815 --> 10:18.849
Pie.

11:07.633 --> 11:11.535
Well, Donna certainly has
a type.

13:04.149 --> 13:05.582
Thanks.

13:05.584 --> 13:08.218
That's new.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.553
What?

13:09.555 --> 13:11.421
You buying food.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.822
I just mean
you usually only pick up

13:12.824 --> 13:14.491
whiskey, pumpkins,
and crossword puzzles.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.059
Well...

13:16.061 --> 13:18.762
crosswords do get better
with whiskey.

13:18.764 --> 13:20.230
Oh.

13:20.232 --> 13:21.531
And I got family
in town.

13:21.533 --> 13:22.966
- Oh, nice. Well, enjoy.
- Yeah.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.101
- Thanks.
- See you later.

13:33.278 --> 13:35.879
Hey, man. Excuse me.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.847
- Hey. Can I help you?
- Yeah, yeah, I think you can.

13:37.849 --> 13:39.583
I'm looking
for a friend of mine --

13:39.585 --> 13:41.051
Mary Winchester.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.787
Sorry.
I don't know her.

13:43.789 --> 13:45.589
Well, she told me to meet her
here in Hibbing,

13:45.591 --> 13:48.091
so if you could just point me
in the right direction,

13:48.093 --> 13:50.427
we're all good,
you know?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.633
Thanks for nothing,
pal.

14:25.464 --> 14:29.232
Ah...damn it.

14:31.903 --> 14:34.871
Oh, come on, man.

15:11.009 --> 15:13.043
Hiya.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.545
Evening, Officer.

15:19.735 --> 15:23.371
You can't --
I didn't do anything.

15:23.373 --> 15:24.605
Oh, sure ya did.

15:24.607 --> 15:27.275
You see,
I ran the plates,

15:27.277 --> 15:29.710
and this van here?

15:29.712 --> 15:32.513
Belongs to an 80-year-old lady
in Missoula.

15:32.515 --> 15:33.614
Yeah.

15:33.616 --> 15:36.250
My Grammy,
she lets me borrow it.

15:36.252 --> 15:37.485
No.

15:37.487 --> 15:40.288
Grammy reported it stolen
two weeks ago.

15:40.290 --> 15:43.291
And word has it you're looking
for a friend of mine,

15:43.293 --> 15:44.759
Mary Winchester.

15:44.761 --> 15:46.627
No, I -- I-I talked
to the kid

15:46.629 --> 15:48.796
about renting a place
for fishing.

15:48.798 --> 15:51.132
Oh. Huh.

15:51.134 --> 15:53.834
You catch a lot of fish
with that Arkansas toothpick

15:53.836 --> 15:57.371
you got there
on the passenger seat?

15:57.373 --> 15:58.940
So...

15:58.942 --> 16:01.108
what's your name?

16:02.045 --> 16:04.512
"Nunya."

16:04.514 --> 16:06.280
What's that?

16:06.282 --> 16:09.150
- First name, Eat, last name, Me.
- Okay.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.388
You see this?

16:14.390 --> 16:17.224
Mobile
fingerprint scanner.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.860
Cost the force
a pretty penny,

16:19.862 --> 16:22.997
but I figured
it'd come in handy.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.636
You won't
give it to me straight...

16:28.638 --> 16:31.639
...but this will.

16:35.545 --> 16:37.478
Uff da.

16:37.480 --> 16:41.916
You're a long way
from Delaware, Nick.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.554
Ugh. Aah!

16:55.565 --> 16:56.831
Okay, sicko.

16:56.833 --> 16:58.265
That's enough.

17:16.019 --> 17:17.284
Hey.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.853
Hey. What were you doing
out there?

17:18.855 --> 17:20.621
Oh, I, uh...

17:20.623 --> 17:21.655
Oh, here.

17:21.656 --> 17:23.691
You know,
I'm just, uh...

17:23.693 --> 17:26.594
taking a look around.

17:26.596 --> 17:27.928
Come on inside.

17:27.930 --> 17:31.132
I got a surprise
for you.

17:42.445 --> 17:44.412
What's all this?

17:44.414 --> 17:45.713
Well,
I wanted to make sure

17:45.715 --> 17:47.648
everything was ready
for you.

17:49.085 --> 17:51.986
And I thought I'd, uh --
I'd give you a hand, you know?

17:51.988 --> 17:53.621
Two terrible cooks
teaming up.

17:53.623 --> 17:55.723
What could possibly
go wrong?

17:59.796 --> 18:01.228
What?

18:01.230 --> 18:02.830
Nothing.

18:12.708 --> 18:15.476
Listen, Mom, I-I --
I think I should come up.

18:15.478 --> 18:18.512
Uh, there's some stuff missing
from the bunker, and --

18:18.514 --> 18:20.614
Sam, I don't know
what's going on,

18:20.616 --> 18:22.883
but something
is going on.

18:22.885 --> 18:24.919
Just give me
some time.

18:24.921 --> 18:27.488
Let me
talk to him, okay?

18:27.490 --> 18:28.789
Okay, yeah.

18:28.791 --> 18:31.859
Um, yeah.
All right, Mom.

18:39.502 --> 18:41.168
He comes back,
he's standing there,

18:41.170 --> 18:42.870
he's soaking wet,
and he's pulling bologna

18:42.872 --> 18:44.972
and sliced cheese out of his pants.

18:44.974 --> 18:48.209
So, me being the big brother,
I'm the cook.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.277
I take all of that bologna,
all that sliced cheese,

18:50.279 --> 18:51.946
and I put it
onto a hot plate.

18:51.948 --> 18:53.581
- No.
- Yeah.

18:53.583 --> 18:56.517
- Oh.
- It stunk up that room so bad.

18:56.519 --> 18:59.186
Dad comes home,
and he is so mad.

18:59.188 --> 19:01.555
He picks up everything,
chucks it in the trash.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.258
Probably reminded him of you,
and...

19:07.163 --> 19:10.731
Anyway,
it did not taste right.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.868
It didn't taste
like this.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.541
Oh.

19:20.543 --> 19:25.746
Sometimes I forget just how much
I missed while I was gone

19:25.748 --> 19:29.116
and how much
the two of you just...

19:31.320 --> 19:35.823
But you're here now, right?

19:35.825 --> 19:37.858
And even though
the last couple of years

19:37.860 --> 19:39.860
have been
a little rough,

19:39.862 --> 19:43.364
just knowing
that you're around,

19:43.366 --> 19:45.533
that you're alive...

19:46.702 --> 19:50.037
Mom, that's meant everything
to me.

19:50.039 --> 19:52.540
And everything
to Sam.

19:53.910 --> 19:56.277
And how great
is this, hm?

19:56.279 --> 19:59.413
You, me, sitting here,
eating the real thing,

19:59.415 --> 20:02.149
not some bologna version
of Winchester Surprise?

20:02.151 --> 20:04.585
You know,
we're not fighting any monsters.

20:04.587 --> 20:08.722
There's -- There's no clouds
on the horizon.

20:13.029 --> 20:14.595
Dean?

20:14.597 --> 20:15.996
Mm-hmm?

20:17.733 --> 20:19.833
Whatever
you're going through,

20:19.835 --> 20:22.303
you can talk to me.

20:27.743 --> 20:29.610
Everybody keeps asking
how I am,

20:29.612 --> 20:35.716
and how I am is
I don't want to talk about it.

20:39.222 --> 20:42.356
Please.

21:51.661 --> 21:53.093
No.

21:53.095 --> 21:55.696
No, no, no.

22:04.307 --> 22:05.639
Mnh.

22:15.384 --> 22:17.951
What?

22:17.953 --> 22:20.154
Oh, God.

22:25.594 --> 22:28.662
Hey.

22:33.569 --> 22:35.536
Ah...

22:36.772 --> 22:38.906
Hey, Donna. It's Dean.
What's up?

22:38.908 --> 22:40.507
He got
the drop on me.

22:40.509 --> 22:42.810
Dean,
he's going after your mom.

22:42.812 --> 22:45.746
- He who?
- Uh, some guy named Nick.

22:50.853 --> 22:53.687
Dean! Whoa, easy!

22:55.758 --> 22:57.291
Dean,
what's going on here?

22:57.293 --> 22:58.692
It's Mom.

22:58.694 --> 23:00.461
She's gone.

23:04.357 --> 23:06.492
The demons,
they know where you are.

23:06.494 --> 23:08.894
They keep track of you,
you and your kids.

23:08.896 --> 23:10.362
They're sort of
scared of you.

23:10.364 --> 23:12.164
So wherever you are,
they're not.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.933
So that's how
I got to Hibbing.

23:13.935 --> 23:16.101
I didn't have
an address.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.504
Luckily, that --
that perky sheriff lady --

23:18.506 --> 23:19.672
what's her name?

23:19.674 --> 23:22.508
Deborah? Debbie?
Something? Whatever.

23:22.510 --> 23:23.742
She had, um...

23:23.744 --> 23:25.911
She had some e-mails
on her cellphone

23:25.913 --> 23:28.247
talking about you
and her family cabin.

23:28.249 --> 23:31.083
So, voilà --
here I am.

23:31.919 --> 23:34.586
I know
that's a lot to take in, but...

23:34.588 --> 23:36.789
And if
you feel like screaming,

23:36.791 --> 23:38.357
you can --
you can go ahead,

23:38.359 --> 23:43.796
'cause we're...
pretty remote.

23:43.798 --> 23:47.366
Nick?
What are you doing?

23:53.507 --> 23:56.141
Tonya Baker.

23:57.745 --> 24:00.446
Yeah, you knew her.
You saved her life.

24:01.549 --> 24:04.350
Yeah, her whole Girl Scout troop
was murdered.

24:04.352 --> 24:07.386
She was the only survivor,
thanks to you.

24:07.388 --> 24:10.723
These two demons
were about to finish her off,

24:10.725 --> 24:13.792
and then you came in,
and you chased one away.

24:13.794 --> 24:15.995
But you faced off
against the other one,

24:15.997 --> 24:18.831
a demon
named Abraxas.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.967
I remember.
So?

24:21.969 --> 24:25.637
So,
Abraxas murdered my family

24:25.639 --> 24:30.042
the same way he killed
those girls --

24:30.044 --> 24:34.179
bloody, brutal, slow.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.415
I'm sorry,
Nick.

24:38.619 --> 24:41.120
But you could have
just asked me.

24:41.122 --> 24:42.521
This is...

24:42.523 --> 24:45.024
Crazy?

24:45.026 --> 24:46.225
Hm?

24:46.227 --> 24:48.961
What would you
have told me?

24:48.963 --> 24:50.629
That I killed him.

24:50.631 --> 24:54.333
Abraxas is dead.

24:55.636 --> 24:59.204
So you would've
lied to me.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.608
His friend got away,
but she saw everything.

25:02.610 --> 25:04.877
You didn't kill Abraxas.

25:04.879 --> 25:07.413
You trapped him
in a box.

25:07.415 --> 25:09.014
How'd you do it?

25:09.016 --> 25:11.750
Uh...

25:11.752 --> 25:13.318
Tell me.

25:13.320 --> 25:15.254
Okay,
you're right.

25:15.256 --> 25:16.455
I trapped him.

25:16.457 --> 25:18.857
We fought,
and he was winning.

25:18.859 --> 25:21.627
So I put him in
an Enochian puzzle box.

25:21.629 --> 25:23.595
He's contained.

25:23.597 --> 25:25.464
Do you have him?

25:27.368 --> 25:28.500
No.

25:32.473 --> 25:35.307
But I can take you
to him.

25:55.529 --> 25:58.097
I got his tags,
put my guys on it.

25:58.099 --> 26:00.699
They're running 'em.
I'm sorry.

26:00.701 --> 26:03.836
It's not your fault, Donna.
It's mine.

26:03.838 --> 26:05.938
Nick said when he left
he was just gonna go home.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.306
I-I didn't know
he was...

26:07.308 --> 26:09.441
Killing people?

26:09.443 --> 26:12.244
<i>- Sheriff?</i>
- Yeah. Go for Hanscum.

26:12.246 --> 26:13.912
<i>We got that van</i>
<i>you were looking for.</i>

26:13.914 --> 26:15.614
<i>A traffic cam</i>
<i>just caught it</i>

26:15.616 --> 26:17.983
<i>pulling into a storage facility</i>
<i>outside Grand Rapids.</i>

26:17.985 --> 26:19.485
Copy that.
I got it from here.

26:19.487 --> 26:21.787
- How far is Grand Rapids?
- 30, 40 minutes.

26:21.789 --> 26:24.022
We'll be there in 20.

27:08.602 --> 27:11.837
All right,
where is it?

27:13.340 --> 27:15.107
Okay, if you do this,
we're done.

27:15.109 --> 27:18.877
You walk. Okay?

27:19.813 --> 27:22.247
Over there.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.353
You first.

28:04.525 --> 28:07.125
Clever.

28:19.106 --> 28:22.641
All right,
where is it?

28:22.643 --> 28:24.843
In the lockers.

28:26.914 --> 28:28.814
Too bad
I forgot the keys.

28:41.295 --> 28:43.996
Which one?

28:47.901 --> 28:51.236
All right,
fine.

28:55.609 --> 28:57.676
Mnh.

29:16.363 --> 29:18.063
Bingo.

29:22.536 --> 29:23.669
Open it.

29:23.671 --> 29:26.204
Me and 'Brax-y
have to have a talk.

29:27.574 --> 29:29.241
Well,
that's not gonna happen.

29:29.243 --> 29:30.375
I'm sorry?

29:30.377 --> 29:32.744
To talk,
a demon needs a host.

29:32.746 --> 29:35.881
It can't be you.

29:35.883 --> 29:38.350
Can't be me.

29:41.455 --> 29:44.089
Didn't really think
this through, did you, Nick?

29:45.559 --> 29:48.093
So I'll improvise.

30:00.708 --> 30:02.574
Say it.

30:02.576 --> 30:05.344
I can see
you want to.

30:05.346 --> 30:07.446
Might as well
go ahead and say it.

30:07.448 --> 30:08.647
All right.

30:08.649 --> 30:10.349
Nick is not a project.

30:10.351 --> 30:12.317
He's not
a freakin' puppy.

30:12.319 --> 30:14.653
He was Lucifer's vessel
for years.

30:14.655 --> 30:16.307
I know that, Dean.
I thought --

30:16.331 --> 30:17.023
You thought he'd what?

30:17.024 --> 30:18.713
Just walk it off? Come on, man.
You're not that dumb.

30:18.737 --> 30:19.592
It's not about
being dumb, Dean.

30:19.593 --> 30:21.226
It's called compassion.

30:21.228 --> 30:24.229
Look, what happened to Nick
could've happened to me.

30:24.231 --> 30:25.464
It <i>almost</i>
happened to me.

30:25.466 --> 30:27.232
You change one little thing
in our past,

30:27.234 --> 30:28.567
and that <i>was</i> me.

30:28.569 --> 30:30.102
Lucifer wearing <i>me</i>
to the prom.

30:30.104 --> 30:32.337
And besides, since when
do we give up on people?

30:32.339 --> 30:34.005
Since when do we just
cut people loose?

30:34.007 --> 30:35.607
Well, maybe you need
to learn, okay?

30:35.609 --> 30:37.743
'Cause when people are
past the point of saving,

30:37.745 --> 30:40.011
maybe you need to learn
to walk away.

30:52.380 --> 30:54.309
Nick, don't do this.

30:54.409 --> 30:55.575
Do what?

30:55.577 --> 30:57.744
You let
that demon out of there,

30:57.746 --> 31:00.079
he could kill us.

31:00.081 --> 31:03.049
I can handle it.

31:04.653 --> 31:07.487
How do you open
this thing?

31:07.489 --> 31:08.988
I don't know.

31:08.990 --> 31:10.723
Mnh.

31:10.725 --> 31:12.625
I don't like you.

31:30.078 --> 31:32.745
I said
I can handle it.

32:22.263 --> 32:25.998
I think there's only one way
to get into this box.

32:32.974 --> 32:34.674
Come on, baby.

32:34.676 --> 32:36.542
Come on, baby.

33:07.776 --> 33:10.743
Heya, Blondie.

33:14.282 --> 33:15.515
Missed ya.

33:15.517 --> 33:17.383
Why did you kill
my family?

33:17.385 --> 33:18.918
Who's he?

33:20.288 --> 33:23.423
Sorry, you're gonna have to be
more specific.

33:23.425 --> 33:25.057
Pike Creek, Delaware.

33:25.059 --> 33:28.094
Oh...

33:28.096 --> 33:29.662
no way.

33:29.664 --> 33:31.063
Nick?

33:31.065 --> 33:34.700
What are you doing
walking and talking?

33:34.702 --> 33:37.537
I thought the Big Man
had you on lock.

33:37.539 --> 33:39.372
Lucifer's dead.

33:39.374 --> 33:41.073
Is he?

33:41.075 --> 33:42.442
Cool.

33:42.444 --> 33:45.411
Why did you kill
my family?

33:45.413 --> 33:48.848
Kill your family,
yeah, got it.

33:48.850 --> 33:50.650
Tell you what --

33:50.652 --> 33:54.587
I'll answer that
when you kill her.

33:54.589 --> 33:58.124
She locked me in a box,
and I hold a grudge.

33:59.928 --> 34:04.630
Do her slow and bloody,
then we'll chat.

34:06.668 --> 34:08.534
Nick.

34:17.911 --> 34:19.145
Nick, no.

34:19.147 --> 34:20.379
Nick, hey!

34:20.380 --> 34:23.014
Don't -- Stop --
N-No!

34:23.016 --> 34:24.917
Aah! Aah! Hey.

34:24.918 --> 34:28.154
Get away from her!
Stay back.

34:33.393 --> 34:35.328
Is she all right?
She's good.

34:35.996 --> 34:38.464
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

34:38.466 --> 34:40.666
What I have to.

34:43.103 --> 34:44.536
- No, Nick --
- No!

34:44.539 --> 34:45.838
Showtime.

34:57.519 --> 35:01.521
You want to know
why I gutted your family?

35:01.523 --> 35:02.855
Orders.

35:02.857 --> 35:05.791
I was
following orders.

35:05.793 --> 35:07.193
From who?

35:07.195 --> 35:08.394
Who do you think?

35:08.396 --> 35:10.963
Lucifer planned
the whole thing.

35:12.133 --> 35:13.766
I don't --
I don't understand.

35:13.768 --> 35:15.134
Why my family?

35:15.136 --> 35:17.069
Why -- Why me?

35:17.071 --> 35:18.371
No particular reason.

35:18.373 --> 35:21.841
You were chosen,
but you're not special.

35:21.843 --> 35:24.043
We threw a dart
at the phone book.

35:24.045 --> 35:26.913
<i>Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus</i>
<i>spiritus, omnis satanica --</i>

35:26.915 --> 35:29.549
Naughty.

35:32.887 --> 35:34.186
So...

35:34.188 --> 35:36.923
who dies first?

35:38.993 --> 35:40.660
Aah!

35:55.743 --> 35:58.044
Nick.

35:58.046 --> 35:59.712
Nick,
take it easy.

36:31.859 --> 36:35.027
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:35.029 --> 36:37.362
Donna. Hold on.

36:37.364 --> 36:41.066
Yeah. Sure.

36:44.705 --> 36:46.638
Why?

36:46.640 --> 36:50.442
I needed the truth,
Sam.

36:50.444 --> 36:53.011
I needed revenge
for my family.

36:53.013 --> 36:55.347
You would've done
the same thing.

36:59.953 --> 37:02.654
I'm sorry.

37:03.490 --> 37:06.258
I'm sorry
I couldn't help you.

37:06.260 --> 37:08.927
I'm sorry
I didn't know how.

37:08.929 --> 37:10.996
It's not about you,
Sam.

37:10.998 --> 37:13.165
It's never about <i>you.</i>

37:13.167 --> 37:17.302
You couldn't fix me 'cause
I don't want to be fixed.

37:17.304 --> 37:19.738
I was never broken.

37:20.641 --> 37:24.042
Yeah, Nick, you are.

37:24.044 --> 37:26.978
I don't feel sorry
for you, Nick.

37:26.980 --> 37:29.681
I feel sorry
for the people you hurt,

37:29.683 --> 37:31.550
the people you murdered,

37:31.552 --> 37:34.586
the people whose faces
will haunt you

37:34.588 --> 37:37.889
every night
for the rest of your life.

37:44.565 --> 37:46.965
You can burn.

37:55.375 --> 37:57.375
Mind your head.

38:01.381 --> 38:04.182
I saw, Dean.

38:04.184 --> 38:05.617
Donna's shed.

38:05.619 --> 38:11.289
I know what you've been
building, planning.

38:11.291 --> 38:13.391
And we are gonna
talk about that.

38:13.393 --> 38:17.629
We are all three of us
gonna talk about that.

38:17.631 --> 38:20.732
So if
you don't tell Sam...

38:20.734 --> 38:24.102
I will.

38:30.744 --> 38:32.711
It's a Ma'lak box.

38:33.947 --> 38:36.114
Secured and warded.

38:36.116 --> 38:37.682
Once inside...

38:37.684 --> 38:40.986
nothing gets out,
not even an archangel.

38:40.988 --> 38:42.587
Especially an archangel.

38:42.589 --> 38:44.122
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I've -- I've read about these,

38:44.124 --> 38:45.557
but no --
but no one's ever --

38:45.559 --> 38:47.359
They're impossible
to build.

38:47.361 --> 38:50.428
Yeah, well,
not so much.

38:50.430 --> 38:52.731
That's your plan?

38:52.733 --> 38:55.901
You want
to be buried alive?

38:55.903 --> 38:59.237
Buried's not safe enough.

38:59.239 --> 39:01.740
Plan is,
pay a little hush money,

39:01.742 --> 39:05.277
charter a boat to take me
out to the Pacific.

39:05.279 --> 39:06.845
Splash.

39:08.248 --> 39:10.382
You and Michael,

39:10.384 --> 39:14.819
trapped together --
for eternity?

39:14.821 --> 39:17.422
Yeah.

39:18.725 --> 39:22.561
You do realize
how insane this is, right?

39:22.563 --> 39:25.730
It's the only sane play
I've got.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.168
Michael gets out,
that's it for this world.

39:30.170 --> 39:31.536
And he <i>will</i> get out.

39:31.538 --> 39:33.705
Well, how do you know that
for sure?

39:33.707 --> 39:34.873
Because I do.

39:34.875 --> 39:37.742
Because I can feel him
in my head.

39:37.744 --> 39:40.612
That door is giving.
I can feel it giving.

39:40.614 --> 39:43.248
- But there has to be another way.
- There's not, okay?

39:43.250 --> 39:44.783
There --

39:44.785 --> 39:46.685
Sam,
you've tried.

39:46.687 --> 39:49.020
Cass has tried.
Jack...

39:49.022 --> 39:51.423
And I love you
for trying.

39:52.993 --> 39:54.426
But none of it's
gonna work.

39:54.428 --> 39:56.695
- We don't know that.
- Yeah, we do.

39:56.697 --> 39:58.129
- What?
- Billie.

39:58.131 --> 39:58.808
Billie?

39:58.832 --> 40:00.622
She paid me
a little visit.

40:02.102 --> 40:06.104
She said that there's only
one way that this ends right.

40:07.674 --> 40:09.140
And this is it --

40:09.142 --> 40:12.711
this, right here,
this box.

40:12.713 --> 40:15.380
So she gave up
the special recipe,

40:15.382 --> 40:17.515
and all I had to do
was the work.

40:17.517 --> 40:18.750
It's fate.

40:18.752 --> 40:21.553
Since when
do we believe in fate?

40:21.555 --> 40:23.088
Now, Sam.

40:23.090 --> 40:24.923
Since now.

40:30.197 --> 40:32.030
So...

40:32.032 --> 40:36.835
you came out here
to see Donna,

40:36.837 --> 40:39.638
to see Mom on some --
some what?

40:39.640 --> 40:42.907
Some sick,
secret farewell tour?

40:44.244 --> 40:46.211
You were gonna leave,

40:46.213 --> 40:49.781
and you weren't even
gonna tell me.

40:49.783 --> 40:51.082
Me.

40:51.084 --> 40:53.885
Do you realize
how messed up that is,

40:53.887 --> 40:56.187
how unfair that is?
- I didn't have a choice!

40:56.189 --> 40:59.057
Sam, you're the last person
I could tell,

40:59.059 --> 41:00.792
the last person
I could be around,

41:00.794 --> 41:03.795
'cause you're the only one that
could've talked me out of it.

41:06.300 --> 41:09.401
And I won't be
talked out of it.

41:09.403 --> 41:10.969
I won't.

41:10.971 --> 41:13.805
I'm doing this.

41:15.075 --> 41:18.510
Now, you can either
let me do it alone...

41:18.512 --> 41:20.679
or you could help me.

41:22.949 --> 41:26.084
But I'm doing this.

41:42.636 --> 41:45.070
All right.
