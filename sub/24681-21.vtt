00:36.583 --> 00:39.279
Then she started making
goo-goo eyes at Mike.

00:39.353 --> 00:41.685
He got all bashful.

00:43.156 --> 00:45.317
Come on, that lady
was like 80 years old.

00:45.392 --> 00:48.156
Ed, we've been driving around
for half an hour.

00:48.228 --> 00:50.423
I'm getting dizzy.
I got it.

00:50.731 --> 00:52.528
It's the next block.

00:54.368 --> 00:56.836
That's nice.
What kind of wood is it?

00:56.903 --> 00:59.201
Jichimu, "chicken-wing wood. "

00:59.272 --> 01:00.933
If you get tired of it,
you can eat it.

01:06.079 --> 01:07.910
I can't believe this.

01:09.316 --> 01:10.442
Oh, no.

01:11.618 --> 01:13.142
I'll talk to her.

01:14.955 --> 01:16.786
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:16.857 --> 01:18.347
She's whacked.

01:19.926 --> 01:22.656
All right, you guys
go back to the car.

01:22.729 --> 01:24.026
Go away.

01:28.301 --> 01:29.461
Leave it alone!

01:36.076 --> 01:38.544
Yo, I need two cigarettes.

01:38.612 --> 01:41.911
We don't sell loosies and
you're underage. Beat it.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.381
They're not home.

01:49.556 --> 01:51.387
Come on, I got money.

01:51.458 --> 01:53.289
Save it for college.
Now out!

02:06.540 --> 02:09.338
Oh, look, they're so adorable.

02:10.877 --> 02:14.108
Oh, wait, look at this one
with all the little hearts.

02:23.957 --> 02:28.223
Hey, stop it! What do you
think you're gonna do with that?

02:28.295 --> 02:29.523
Hey!

03:30.590 --> 03:34.651
The lady took two in the chest.
No purse, no ID, and no wits.

03:34.728 --> 03:37.754
The casings are all. 22s. Seventh
mugging in a month in the area.

03:37.831 --> 03:39.355
Why we're here.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.062
The male victim's
at Bellevue?

03:42.135 --> 03:45.263
With a shoulder shot. Michael
Pike, he lives three blocks over.

03:45.338 --> 03:46.999
Unconscious when
they found him.

03:47.073 --> 03:48.973
The slug was flattened
against the sidewalk.

03:49.042 --> 03:50.441
He must've been down
when he took the hit.

03:50.510 --> 03:53.570
MP, Michael Pike.
She must be his girlfriend.

03:55.148 --> 03:56.843
Smells like she's had
a couple of drinks.

03:56.917 --> 03:58.544
So did Mr. Pike.

03:58.618 --> 04:02.384
We'll need a dumpster and sewer
search, five blocks in each direction,

04:02.455 --> 04:04.548
for a weapon and a purse.

04:14.401 --> 04:17.392
Someone was picking at
a poster back there.

04:17.470 --> 04:21.166
Could have been the killer, cooped
up there, waiting for his mark.

04:21.241 --> 04:25.041
Look, so the girl
rounds the corner,

04:26.580 --> 04:28.980
killer doesn't see
the boyfriend.

04:30.317 --> 04:31.978
Makes his move.

04:32.052 --> 04:35.283
She doesn't give up the goods
fast enough, he shoots her.

04:35.355 --> 04:40.224
As a girl, walking alone with
her boyfriend 30 steps behind her?

04:42.462 --> 04:44.862
Not my idea of a
romantic stroll.

04:50.303 --> 04:52.703
Dana was looking
at this baby store

04:52.772 --> 04:55.673
and some people came up behind
us, and then she... I heard...

04:55.742 --> 04:58.711
She said, "What are you
gonna do with that?"

05:00.947 --> 05:04.041
And then he shot her.
He shot her.

05:05.785 --> 05:07.719
You get a good look
at these people?

05:07.787 --> 05:08.811
No.

05:10.423 --> 05:13.153
The guy who shot her
was wearing a hood.

05:15.061 --> 05:16.926
I tried to help, but I fell.

05:16.997 --> 05:20.592
Anyone we can call for you?
You know, family or a friend?

05:21.301 --> 05:23.667
My whole family
is in San Diego.

05:26.039 --> 05:29.634
You can call Ed, my friend Ed.
His number's in my wallet.

05:32.345 --> 05:34.472
We're very sorry, Mr. Pike.

05:35.649 --> 05:37.412
It says, "Caption World. "
You make captions?

05:37.484 --> 05:39.475
For the hearing-impaired.

05:41.488 --> 05:45.117
I'm also an actor. That's how
Dana and me met, in acting class.

05:45.191 --> 05:50.788
When she was shot at the corner,
were you far away from her?

05:53.166 --> 05:56.602
I had the ring out. I was thinking
about what I was gonna say.

05:56.670 --> 05:58.934
You were gonna propose to her?

06:01.374 --> 06:04.969
We're sorry,
we didn't find any ring.

06:05.045 --> 06:07.479
You take it out,
maybe to look at it?

06:09.549 --> 06:12.985
Just once, before we
left the Rocket Inn.

06:14.454 --> 06:18.447
I was waiting for Dana, and that's
when I made up my mind to ask.

06:23.930 --> 06:27.388
He sat right there. The lovebirds.
They come in every Friday night.

06:27.467 --> 06:29.332
Before they left, did you
notice anybody next to him,

06:29.402 --> 06:32.394
maybe paying too much
attention to him?

06:32.472 --> 06:33.871
A skinny Hispanic kid.

06:33.940 --> 06:36.704
Leather coat, a hoodie. He
was trying to buy cigarettes.

06:36.776 --> 06:40.803
He had a girl with him, a black girl, had
a baby face. She was wearing a hairnet.

06:41.915 --> 06:44.884
Anything else you notice about
her? Tattoo, jewelry, rings?

06:44.951 --> 06:48.751
No rings, but her hand was all red
and covered with some kind of ointment,

06:48.822 --> 06:52.258
which I noticed after she
stuck it in the peanut bowl.

06:54.327 --> 06:55.419
Um...

06:55.495 --> 06:58.862
Uh... Hairnet?

06:58.932 --> 07:00.627
You know, a burn? Maybe
she works in a kitchen?

07:00.700 --> 07:01.689
Hmm.

07:02.302 --> 07:04.862
What's around here,
closes late?

07:04.938 --> 07:06.667
There's a cupcake bakery
a couple of blocks over.

07:06.740 --> 07:09.231
They hire a lot of kids
from the projects.

07:11.111 --> 07:15.047
I told them. I found it on
the street last night, Mama.

07:15.115 --> 07:18.744
Hush up. She's not
answering any more questions.

07:18.818 --> 07:23.778
The girl's 15, but as long as her mother runs
interference, we're not gonna get anything.

07:25.191 --> 07:28.024
Take her downstairs
for photos and prints.

07:28.561 --> 07:31.997
Margie, we need to get some
pictures and fingerprints.

07:34.167 --> 07:35.498
Don't forget your soda.

07:35.568 --> 07:37.058
Thank you, ma'am.

07:39.706 --> 07:41.867
Not easy raising a daughter.

07:44.310 --> 07:46.301
I raised three of my own.

07:47.947 --> 07:50.541
This is them,
a few years ago anyway.

07:54.053 --> 07:57.921
This one here. She's our wild
child. I used to find myself wishing

07:57.991 --> 08:01.290
someone could just pluck the
bad influences out of her life.

08:02.195 --> 08:04.857
Your daughter
is a good student.

08:04.931 --> 08:06.330
She got herself
a part-time job.

08:07.100 --> 08:10.831
We don't think she was involved
in what happened last night.

08:11.171 --> 08:16.575
But there's a bad influence somewhere,
some boy she's impressed with.

08:19.746 --> 08:23.307
He's already gotten her into this
trouble and it's only the beginning.

08:24.584 --> 08:27.519
He might talk her into
running away with him.

08:28.755 --> 08:32.020
But if we knew who he was,
where we could find him,

08:33.092 --> 08:35.082
Ms. Jarrett,

08:35.160 --> 08:37.823
we could pluck him out of your
daughter's life like a bad tooth.

08:49.309 --> 08:51.743
Diego is not here.
He's gone away.

08:51.811 --> 08:55.679
I don't see him getting very far without
his Game Boy and his asthma medicine.

08:56.649 --> 09:01.951
Does your grandson appreciate
how tidy you keep your apartment?

09:02.021 --> 09:07.516
I mean, other than these cushions
here, the zippers, it's facing out.

09:15.802 --> 09:17.793
I done nothing!
I done nothing!

09:17.871 --> 09:21.272
That's no way to start a
conversation with us, Diego.

09:32.418 --> 09:35.979
What's in here?
Diamond ring?

09:36.055 --> 09:37.386
Mints!

09:41.094 --> 09:44.461
Where is it? Did you swallow
it? You swallow the bling-bling?

09:44.998 --> 09:47.330
You're a real
circus act, Diego.

09:48.601 --> 09:51.900
Listen to me. The diamond
ring, it's a marquise cut.

09:52.405 --> 09:53.804
The edges
are like little saws.

09:53.873 --> 09:56.398
It'll cut your gut
from one side to the other.

09:56.476 --> 09:58.706
The only safe way to get it out
is to take you to the hospital

09:58.778 --> 10:00.473
and have them
pump your stomach.

10:00.546 --> 10:02.138
I got no ring.

10:02.215 --> 10:05.707
No? All right, you'll just have to
wait here while we toss the place.

10:10.056 --> 10:11.785
Okay, okay!

10:14.994 --> 10:17.758
I swallowed the ring, man,
but I didn't cap nobody!

10:17.830 --> 10:18.819
Somebody else in your crew?

10:18.898 --> 10:21.025
No, no, no, no.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.000
I saw the white dude
had the ring.

10:23.069 --> 10:26.095
We were gonna swarm him and his
girl, just muscle the ring from him.

10:26.172 --> 10:29.232
But at the corner, this other guy,
he started tangling with the girl.

10:29.309 --> 10:30.333
Who was he?

10:30.410 --> 10:33.004
I don't know. He capped the
girl and the dude and he split.

10:33.079 --> 10:35.570
He left the ring and the purse.
We grabbed them. That's all we did.

10:35.648 --> 10:37.582
What did you do
with the purse?

10:37.650 --> 10:41.279
It's in the trash can in the
park. Got a bullet hole in it.

10:42.288 --> 10:44.256
The shooter,
what did he look like?

10:44.324 --> 10:46.292
He had a hood,
I didn't see his face.

10:47.093 --> 10:51.553
Something was wrong with his right
foot, though. Ran off hoppity-hopping.

10:53.499 --> 10:55.490
<i>Then I heard her say,</i>

10:55.568 --> 10:57.126
<i>"What do you think
you're gonna do with that?"</i>

10:58.004 --> 11:00.495
<i>And then he shot her.</i>

11:03.810 --> 11:06.472
<i>I'm trying not to hate
the person that did this</i>

11:07.647 --> 11:09.547
<i>because Dana
wouldn't want me to.</i>

11:10.750 --> 11:12.581
<i>Michael Pike, ring in hand,</i>

11:12.652 --> 11:14.779
<i>was about to get on his knee
and pop the question</i>

11:14.854 --> 11:18.585
<i>to Dana Candon, when she was
gunned down by a mugger's bullets</i>

11:18.658 --> 11:21.286
<i>here on the cold streets
of the Lower East Side.</i>

11:21.828 --> 11:25.730
Unbelievable, huh? Your old
boyfriend, they shot him over on Ridge.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.627
You didn't know?

11:29.669 --> 11:31.830
We haven't talked in a while.

11:34.073 --> 11:36.405
You're right
about the feathers.

11:37.043 --> 11:40.171
The bullet went through
the victim's coat first,

11:40.747 --> 11:43.238
pulled the feathers
into the purse.

11:43.583 --> 11:47.679
She was carrying her purse inside her
coat to protect it from purse-snatchers.

11:47.754 --> 11:50.689
It dropped to the ground
after she was shot.

11:52.859 --> 11:55.589
The other mugger
couldn't see her purse.

11:56.062 --> 11:58.030
I mean, for all he knew,
she didn't have one,

11:58.097 --> 12:01.066
but he targeted her
all the same.

12:01.134 --> 12:02.692
Just as she was
getting engaged.

12:03.436 --> 12:05.563
The bride that wasn't to be.

12:11.611 --> 12:15.570
Dana's last boyfriend moved
back to Colorado last year.

12:15.648 --> 12:19.778
What's it matter? The papers said
it was muggers, a bunch of kids.

12:19.852 --> 12:23.117
They were there, but we don't
think they're the ones who shot you.

12:24.123 --> 12:27.320
What about you, Mike?
Anyone have a beef with you?

12:28.828 --> 12:30.762
I don't wanna
get her in trouble.

12:30.830 --> 12:33.765
Her? Somebody you've
been seeing on the side?

12:34.400 --> 12:38.894
There was no one except Dana. I mean,
the girl I was with before, Kelly.

12:38.971 --> 12:40.233
Last name?

12:40.306 --> 12:41.330
Kelly West.

12:42.408 --> 12:46.105
She came out from San Diego
with Ed and me three years ago.

12:48.114 --> 12:52.551
We were together a long time, so it
was rough when we broke up last year.

12:56.055 --> 12:57.488
You're moving your lips.

12:57.557 --> 13:00.890
I mean, you were saying what you
were gonna say before you said it.

13:00.960 --> 13:04.726
My acting teacher says I do that
when I'm trying to remember my lines.

13:04.797 --> 13:06.094
Why would you need to
remember your lines,

13:06.165 --> 13:09.362
unless you're hiding something
about... Was it Kelly?

13:11.771 --> 13:14.399
Look, she couldn't have possibly
done this. It's too crazy.

13:14.474 --> 13:17.568
When was the last time
you had contact with her?

13:19.812 --> 13:23.942
Last weekend we drove out to
Flushing to eat and she was there.

13:24.016 --> 13:27.008
And she followed you?
This happen before?

13:27.086 --> 13:28.485
A few times.

13:28.554 --> 13:31.318
She was stalking you.
You report it?

13:31.390 --> 13:33.620
Ed talked me into
signing a complaint.

13:33.693 --> 13:36.059
The detective said
he'd talk to Kelly.

13:38.097 --> 13:39.962
I told her she was gonna
get herself arrested.

13:40.032 --> 13:41.829
And for what, you know?
She was wasting her time.

13:41.901 --> 13:45.132
I told her Mike and Dana were
getting a place together, and that...

13:46.539 --> 13:51.033
Maybe I shouldn't have done that,
huh? Geez, what a grade-A moron.

13:51.110 --> 13:53.476
She would've found out
sooner or later.

13:54.947 --> 13:57.643
You wanna smoke that cigarette,
go ahead, don't mind us.

13:57.717 --> 14:00.185
Oh! No, it's okay.
I don't smoke.

14:00.253 --> 14:02.050
The filter's pinched.

14:04.824 --> 14:06.689
It's for a character
I've been working on.

14:07.860 --> 14:09.350
Another actor.

14:09.795 --> 14:12.958
Kelly, she ever threaten
Mike or Dana?

14:13.466 --> 14:16.867
No. But she works at
Nightcritters over on Delancey.

14:16.936 --> 14:19.734
I gotta go see Mike,
get up to his room.

14:21.908 --> 14:26.345
I finished my shift at 1:00. If
I knew I was gonna need an alibi,

14:26.412 --> 14:28.539
I would've brought one of
these losers here home.

14:28.614 --> 14:31.674
Ms. West, you might
want to can the attitude.

14:31.751 --> 14:34.845
I know where this is going.
I was not stalking Mike.

14:34.921 --> 14:36.013
You were crowding him.

14:36.088 --> 14:38.955
We've talked to the detective
that took his complaint.

14:39.025 --> 14:41.892
Five separate incidents,
witnesses.

14:43.095 --> 14:44.756
It was coincidence.

14:45.531 --> 14:48.989
After Mike sent that cop to
chat me up, I talked to a lawyer.

14:49.068 --> 14:52.560
He told me next time a cop
shows up to give them this.

14:54.674 --> 14:57.199
So much for the
element of surprise.

15:04.250 --> 15:07.845
It's just the wear
on her heels.

15:08.654 --> 15:12.021
You know, she supinates, so her
heels roll out when she runs.

15:12.091 --> 15:14.184
She must get blisters
like crazy.

15:16.095 --> 15:17.460
Kelly run a lot?

15:17.530 --> 15:20.431
Cross-country. She drives
upstate on the weekends.

15:20.499 --> 15:23.935
Then she's here on her feet,
for 12 hours a stretch.

15:24.003 --> 15:26.301
She complain
about blisters?

15:26.372 --> 15:27.771
At least once a day.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.068
Last Friday night?

15:29.141 --> 15:31.268
Yeah, she could hardly walk.

15:33.112 --> 15:35.546
Good enough
for a search warrant.

15:36.916 --> 15:40.875
Her apartment's clean. No
gun, no ammo, no dark hoodie.

15:41.821 --> 15:44.449
Just a lot of photography
equipment, and these.

15:48.728 --> 15:50.195
Fixated much?

15:52.932 --> 15:54.058
I like this.

15:54.133 --> 15:56.260
That waterfall looks like
Harriman State Park.

15:56.335 --> 15:58.235
My old man used to
take us hiking there.

15:58.304 --> 16:01.467
Yeah, she takes her
cross-country running seriously.

16:01.540 --> 16:04.668
Shoe spikes for all
different kinds of terrain.

16:05.177 --> 16:09.011
Topographical maps,
half a dozen state parks.

16:13.452 --> 16:16.751
Well, I got
parking lot receipts,

16:16.822 --> 16:19.586
admission tickets
for state parks.

16:23.429 --> 16:27.365
Well, what do you do after you
shoot your ex-boyfriend's girlfriend?

16:27.433 --> 16:28.957
You go hiking.

16:29.035 --> 16:31.503
I got an admission receipt
for Harriman State Park

16:31.570 --> 16:34.232
stamped 8:20
last Saturday morning.

16:40.279 --> 16:44.613
<i>Well, Harriman's got 46,000 acres.
That's a lot of places to bury a gun.</i>

16:59.799 --> 17:03.496
Prizes. When was the last time
you went on a treasure hunt?

17:04.069 --> 17:05.662
How about never?

17:07.506 --> 17:08.700
Geocaching.

17:10.142 --> 17:13.270
"Players hide caches containing
a prize and a logbook,

17:14.413 --> 17:18.315
"post the GPS coordinates on the
Web, along with a clue or riddle.

17:18.384 --> 17:20.784
"When other players find the
cache, they take the prize,

17:20.853 --> 17:24.482
"leave one of their own
and sign the logbook. "

17:24.557 --> 17:26.855
These must be
the prizes she found.

17:26.925 --> 17:28.826
And this is
what she leaves.

17:28.894 --> 17:30.384
They have any caches
in Harriman Park?

17:31.197 --> 17:33.529
Well, it looks like
30-plus caches.

17:33.599 --> 17:36.796
The trick is figuring out
the ones she visited.

17:42.708 --> 17:44.369
This is the last thing
that Kelly wrote in here.

17:46.212 --> 17:48.180
"Footbridge. "
Assuming that's an answer,

17:48.247 --> 17:51.478
we just have to find the
riddle that goes with it.

17:51.550 --> 17:55.611
"A face that cannot see, hands
that cannot hold. " A clock.

17:57.723 --> 18:01.955
Here, "Twelve inches
for a dentist. " A footbridge.

18:04.663 --> 18:06.790
It's this one right here.

18:06.866 --> 18:08.060
Watch out for deer ticks.

18:22.848 --> 18:24.475
It's one of hers.

18:33.058 --> 18:36.084
It's got her signature
from two Saturdays ago.

18:38.264 --> 18:39.595
Over here.

18:41.534 --> 18:44.332
Scrape marks. Somebody lost
their footing down there.

18:48.507 --> 18:50.907
See, that rock's
been turned over.

18:52.578 --> 18:55.172
Okay. Dig here.

19:02.588 --> 19:04.715
Looks like
our black hoodie.

19:12.932 --> 19:15.264
Now that's what
I call a prize.

19:19.238 --> 19:22.264
Nature walks and
treasure hunts. Some case.

19:24.043 --> 19:26.375
It was buried not
100 feet from the cache

19:26.445 --> 19:29.073
where she left the keychain
and a signed logbook.

19:29.148 --> 19:31.514
Which isn't the same as saying
she's the one who buried it.

19:31.584 --> 19:35.111
The gun used to kill the
fiancée of the guy she stalked.

19:35.187 --> 19:36.677
I told you,
I never followed him.

19:36.755 --> 19:38.279
The guy she was obsessed with.

19:38.357 --> 19:39.415
Obsessed?

19:39.492 --> 19:41.084
You gotta be kidding.

19:42.628 --> 19:43.822
What's that?

19:43.896 --> 19:48.162
It's Mike right there.
Mike. Mike.

19:48.234 --> 19:49.895
Those are for his headshots.

19:49.969 --> 19:52.767
I used to take pictures
of actors and movie sets.

19:54.006 --> 19:57.840
This is what
I'm obsessed with now.

19:57.910 --> 20:01.368
Nature. You wanna know what Mike said
after I stopped taking pictures of him?

20:01.447 --> 20:05.144
He said I wasn't being supportive
of his career, of his dreams.

20:05.217 --> 20:06.809
Kelly.
That's when he dumped you?

20:06.886 --> 20:10.447
Dumped me? I dumped him! I
caught him cheating with Dana!

20:12.191 --> 20:13.180
I left him!

20:13.259 --> 20:14.556
Kelly,
you've made your point.

20:14.627 --> 20:16.527
This interview's over.

20:18.831 --> 20:22.130
Her lawyer's not wrong. We need
to put that gun in her hand.

20:22.201 --> 20:25.261
Maybe ballistics can
trace it back to an owner.

20:26.805 --> 20:29.933
She rages on, in spite of
all the evidence against her.

20:30.009 --> 20:33.069
She could confess,
but where's the fun in that?

20:37.149 --> 20:40.482
The lands and grooves match
the slugs from the victim,

20:40.553 --> 20:44.148
but the serial number on
the weapon's been filed off,

20:44.223 --> 20:47.090
along with some other markings
on the heel of the grip.

20:47.159 --> 20:50.128
This model, they stopped
making it, what, 10 years ago?

20:50.195 --> 20:51.253
At least.

20:51.330 --> 20:57.792
These marks on the slugs look very
crisp. Has the barrel been re-bored?

20:57.870 --> 21:02.239
No. The weapon probably
hasn't been fired much.

21:08.314 --> 21:11.875
Yeah, the firing pin
looks worn down.

21:13.352 --> 21:14.876
So does the strike plate.

21:14.954 --> 21:18.549
The wear pattern is what you'd
expect from a 10-year-old gun.

21:18.624 --> 21:21.991
Ten years of shooting, but no
slugs go through the barrel.

21:22.928 --> 21:24.156
Blanks?

21:24.229 --> 21:25.787
Prop gun.

21:25.864 --> 21:28.128
Kelly said that she worked
on movie sets.

21:32.137 --> 21:35.300
<i>Here we go, Gunplay.
All weapons accounted for.</i>

21:35.374 --> 21:39.936
This woman was the photographer on
the film, Kelly West. Ring a bell?

21:40.746 --> 21:42.077
No, sorry.

21:43.716 --> 21:45.843
Where do you
keep your guns?

21:47.987 --> 21:49.477
Who has access to them?

21:49.555 --> 21:53.719
Me, two other guys. We keep
the guns under lock and key.

21:53.792 --> 21:55.783
There's the lock. And
there's the key in the lock.

21:55.861 --> 21:57.624
You always leave
it like that?

21:57.696 --> 21:58.924
We try not to.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.495
Great. A cast of thousands.

22:07.206 --> 22:09.367
A pinched filter.

22:11.243 --> 22:12.835
That look familiar?

22:12.911 --> 22:14.708
Mike's little buddy, Ed.

22:15.381 --> 22:18.976
You have anybody that works here
that holds their cigarette like this?

22:19.051 --> 22:22.680
One of our drivers, Johnny
Santos. Thinks he's James Dean.

22:24.323 --> 22:26.951
Never seen her.
Never seen him.

22:27.026 --> 22:30.393
Now see, this guy Ed, he's
pretty much told us he knows you.

22:30.462 --> 22:32.555
That man's a liar, Officer.

22:33.732 --> 22:35.131
Hot in here.

22:36.669 --> 22:39.229
No, yeah, he knows you.

22:41.240 --> 22:44.801
He stole that overhand cigarette
grip of yours, you know.

22:46.311 --> 22:49.644
He got that and
this gun from you.

22:49.715 --> 22:53.116
It was used in a murder last week,
Johnny, which makes you an accessory,

22:53.185 --> 22:55.210
which means you
have to talk to us.

22:57.222 --> 22:58.849
Not me, Officer.

22:59.758 --> 23:01.157
Hot in here.

23:02.061 --> 23:05.656
You know, Ed told us that
you're a big fan of James Dean.

23:06.331 --> 23:09.664
You know, you like to move
like him, dress like him.

23:09.768 --> 23:12.362
You know, right down to
the fact that you have...

23:12.438 --> 23:16.568
Is it true that you have a little
Sal Mineo waiting for you at home?

23:19.378 --> 23:22.142
Son of a bitch,
he's the one that talked.

23:22.214 --> 23:24.682
He's baiting you,
Johnny, let's go.

23:31.890 --> 23:36.156
We'll keep an eye on Johnny. If
anything turns up, we'll let you know.

23:37.863 --> 23:42.266
<i>Ed worked as a production assistant
on Gunplay. And Mike had a bit part.</i>

23:42.835 --> 23:45.167
These two are joined
at the hip.

23:46.205 --> 23:48.639
Maybe with Mike
getting married,

23:48.707 --> 23:50.902
Ed was afraid of being
odd man out.

23:51.410 --> 23:54.470
He might've used
Kelly's obsession with Mike

23:54.546 --> 23:56.411
as a cover-up to
get rid of Dana.

23:56.482 --> 24:00.816
Not the kind of bachelor party Mike
was expecting from his best friend.

24:04.590 --> 24:08.458
We all worked on that film. Kelly
and me were still together, and Ed.

24:08.527 --> 24:10.825
It was us against the world,
you know? UAW.

24:10.896 --> 24:13.057
Until you started
seeing Dana?

24:13.132 --> 24:14.565
That was after
Kelly and me broke up.

24:14.633 --> 24:17.193
After she caught you cheating.

24:17.269 --> 24:21.865
Point is, Mike, is that,
well, you were moving on.

24:21.940 --> 24:24.704
You know, we know how Kelly
felt about it, what about Ed?

24:27.212 --> 24:29.976
Ed... Ed was fine.
He liked Dana.

24:31.350 --> 24:34.376
These scenes,
you're practicing them?

24:35.187 --> 24:36.381
I have auditions.

24:36.455 --> 24:39.219
So soon? I don't know
how you can concentrate.

24:39.291 --> 24:41.156
I gotta make a living.

24:41.794 --> 24:43.386
Why are you guys
asking about Ed?

24:43.462 --> 24:45.259
Well, it occurred to us

24:45.330 --> 24:48.629
Ed is the one who told Kelly
you were moving in with Dana.

24:48.700 --> 24:49.724
So what?

24:49.802 --> 24:51.770
Well, knowing
Kelly's behavior,

24:51.870 --> 24:54.634
maybe Ed was trying to,

24:55.908 --> 24:58.376
you know, stir things up,
make some trouble.

24:58.443 --> 25:00.843
<i>This is Fern Hill.</i>

25:00.913 --> 25:04.212
"Now as I was young and easy
under the apple boughs. "

25:05.317 --> 25:07.342
My father's favorite poem.

25:08.620 --> 25:09.712
Yeah.

25:10.522 --> 25:14.049
Yeah. I don't get it. Ed
wouldn't stir up any trouble.

25:14.126 --> 25:16.424
He might,
if it drove Dana away.

25:16.495 --> 25:17.723
Put yourself in his shoes.

25:17.796 --> 25:20.890
He followed you from San Diego.
Now you're getting work as an actor,

25:20.966 --> 25:23.867
while he's lucky to
get hired as a gofer.

25:23.936 --> 25:25.699
Ed just needs to
build his confidence.

25:25.771 --> 25:28.797
Still, maybe he was feeling
like he was being left behind,

25:28.874 --> 25:32.002
you know, like Kelly when you
were starting a new life with Dana.

25:32.077 --> 25:36.070
No, no way. Ed's the one who
convinced me to go to the police.

25:36.148 --> 25:38.412
When Kelly was stalking me, I
wasn't even taking it seriously.

25:38.483 --> 25:40.348
Being stalked wasn't serious?

25:40.953 --> 25:44.753
Well, I mean, you know, an ex-girlfriend
who still has the hots for me?

25:46.425 --> 25:49.292
Yeah, you found
that flattering?

25:51.630 --> 25:53.723
Most people would
find it frightening

25:53.799 --> 25:57.030
knowing that someone's
watching them all the time.

25:57.102 --> 25:59.195
Well, it wasn't all the time.

25:59.271 --> 26:02.263
You know, we'd take a drive
and she'd follow us in her car.

26:03.075 --> 26:04.702
Wait, what I'm
trying to say is,

26:04.776 --> 26:07.506
Ed saw the danger and
was trying to protect me.

26:07.579 --> 26:11.071
We've been looking out for each other
since high school. Like I said, UAW.

26:11.149 --> 26:12.138
Anything else?

26:12.217 --> 26:15.015
No. We certainly
didn't mean to upset you.

26:20.392 --> 26:24.590
Most guys freak out if their exes
send them even a Christmas card.

26:24.663 --> 26:27.325
Only somebody who's
never been stalked

26:27.399 --> 26:31.301
would find the idea of being the
object of obsession appealing.

26:32.271 --> 26:35.672
Except there were witnesses
who saw Kelly following him.

26:35.741 --> 26:36.901
Right.

26:37.709 --> 26:41.110
Brooklyn, Queens, all the
places that they drove to.

26:41.880 --> 26:44.576
Kelly's car,
we gotta look at it again.

26:52.224 --> 26:55.022
Dana, you'll always
be alive in my heart.

27:00.232 --> 27:02.860
When we talked about
having a family,

27:04.536 --> 27:06.527
there was a poem Dana read

27:06.605 --> 27:10.063
that made her think of the
child we might have someday.

27:12.010 --> 27:13.739
<i>It became our poem.</i>

27:15.480 --> 27:17.539
<i>Dylan Thomas wrote it.
It's called Fern Hill.</i>

27:20.519 --> 27:22.612
"Now as I'm young and easy

27:25.223 --> 27:26.986
"under the apple boughs

27:28.160 --> 27:31.527
"About the lilting house
happy as the grass was green

27:33.632 --> 27:36.032
<i>"The night above
the dingle starry</i>

27:38.103 --> 27:40.663
<i>"Time let me hale and climb. "</i>

27:45.177 --> 27:48.374
Here. Some duct tape
that's been cut recently.

27:50.816 --> 27:52.078
Something was
taped to the car.

27:52.150 --> 27:54.482
Well, it's the right size
for a GPS transceiver.

27:54.553 --> 27:56.350
Sure.
They put a bug on her car.

27:56.421 --> 28:00.187
They could track her
at a distance from their car.

28:00.625 --> 28:04.220
You could load the tracking
program onto a PalmPilot,

28:04.296 --> 28:07.697
the person next to you doesn't
have to know what you're doing.

28:09.101 --> 28:10.659
They all end up
in the same place

28:10.736 --> 28:13.830
so it can look like
Kelly was following Mike.

28:13.905 --> 28:17.363
And that she'd be crazy
enough to shoot his girlfriend.

28:18.276 --> 28:22.144
Mike set up Kelly
while Ed was killing Dana.

28:22.681 --> 28:27.414
He even took a bullet in the shoulder
to make it look real. Now that's acting.

28:31.790 --> 28:32.950
With a bug on her car,

28:33.025 --> 28:36.517
Mike and Ed could have tracked Kelly up
to Harriman State Park the week before.

28:36.595 --> 28:38.153
Depending where
she parked her car,

28:38.230 --> 28:41.028
they could tell which
geocache she visited.

28:41.099 --> 28:43.033
Then later, Ed went
and stashed the gun.

28:43.101 --> 28:45.069
I'm not seeing
the motive here.

28:45.137 --> 28:48.402
This kid, Mike, bought his
girlfriend, Dana, a ring.

28:48.473 --> 28:51.874
They were moving in together.
They were good to go.

28:51.943 --> 28:54.411
<i>Dana, you'll always
be alive in my heart.</i>

28:54.913 --> 28:58.542
Mike held a memorial last night
on the corner where Dana was shot.

28:58.884 --> 29:00.249
Somebody invited
the TV cameras.

29:00.318 --> 29:01.910
That was thoughtful.
See, he's moving?

29:01.987 --> 29:04.683
<i>When we talked about
having a family...</i>

29:04.890 --> 29:06.687
Now, watch his buddy.

29:07.159 --> 29:09.627
<i>...there was a poem
Dana read</i>

29:10.562 --> 29:14.430
<i>that made her think of the
child we might have someday.</i>

29:15.067 --> 29:17.729
Ed made sure that the
image was framed perfectly,

29:17.803 --> 29:21.068
so that the baby clothes
were directly behind Mike.

29:21.973 --> 29:23.372
And then...

29:23.442 --> 29:25.467
<i>"Among the wagons I was...</i>

29:27.045 --> 29:29.343
<i>"I was prince of the apple... "</i>

29:31.249 --> 29:32.375
<i>Dana.</i>

29:33.952 --> 29:36.512
Nothing like watching
a crocodile cry.

29:36.588 --> 29:39.318
Yesterday when we talked to
him, he was rehearsing this.

29:39.391 --> 29:42.849
Had it marked up exactly
where he started to choke up.

29:44.362 --> 29:46.159
Ed shows up on cue.

29:46.231 --> 29:48.791
Still doesn't tell me why
he'd want his girlfriend dead.

29:48.867 --> 29:52.064
Well, if there was trouble
in paradise, dig it up.

29:54.139 --> 29:56.733
Mike and Dana
had the same agent.

29:56.808 --> 30:00.244
Wonder how she feels about
clients killing each other.

30:04.950 --> 30:06.212
Audition.

30:08.053 --> 30:10.112
Maybe that's what this is.

30:15.093 --> 30:18.620
I no longer represent Mike.
He fired me two days ago.

30:18.697 --> 30:20.460
I'm returning those.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.128
It's too bad. I've gotten so many
phone calls about him in the last week.

30:25.203 --> 30:27.194
You don't sound surprised
he dumped you.

30:27.272 --> 30:29.763
I knew he was gonna leave
even before he did.

30:29.841 --> 30:32.639
The fact that I also
represented Dana, well...

30:32.711 --> 30:37.978
Sharing an agent, among
actors, that's intimacy.

30:38.049 --> 30:40.483
And intimacy
can breed jealousy.

30:40.552 --> 30:42.452
They competed
for your attention.

30:42.521 --> 30:43.783
Mike competed.

30:44.789 --> 30:48.725
Last month, I got Dana
invited to a premiere party.

30:48.793 --> 30:51.626
Mike accused me
of being disloyal.

30:51.696 --> 30:53.721
He said now he knew
who his friends were.

30:54.633 --> 30:56.601
His career,
how was that going?

30:56.668 --> 31:00.729
Slowly. But he has
the looks, the drive.

31:01.339 --> 31:03.273
At our
first meeting he told me,

31:03.341 --> 31:07.107
"Just get the cameras on me
and they'll never look away. "

31:11.183 --> 31:16.052
What about him? Ed Lang.
He seems very taken by Mike.

31:16.421 --> 31:18.981
Ed has great potential
as a character actor.

31:19.691 --> 31:23.684
Except he's mortified of auditions,
and if you don't audition, well...

31:25.697 --> 31:27.494
<i>This is Midnight Cowboy?</i>

31:27.566 --> 31:31.502
Their college did a stage adaptation
of the film. Mike played Joe Buck.

31:31.903 --> 31:35.896
Ed played Ratso Rizzo.
That's a character who limps.

31:36.575 --> 31:41.171
Well, Kelly took this photo. Maybe
she knows about Ed's acting tricks.

31:43.348 --> 31:46.340
Ed read that the actor
who played the Ratso character

31:46.418 --> 31:49.478
in the movie put stones in his
shoe, so that's what he did.

31:49.554 --> 31:53.012
The night Dana was shot,
you were limping at work.

31:53.091 --> 31:56.390
Somebody could've watched you
through the window from the street.

31:56.461 --> 31:58.554
You're saying someone
imitated her limp?

31:58.630 --> 31:59.722
Maybe.

32:02.567 --> 32:03.761
No.

32:04.803 --> 32:08.739
Ed didn't... Why would he?

32:10.141 --> 32:11.699
Exactly, why would he?

32:11.776 --> 32:14.472
Ed sees Mike as
some kind of meal ticket?

32:15.847 --> 32:18.077
It was almost
the other way around.

32:18.149 --> 32:21.846
Back in San Diego, Ed got
a small part in a big movie.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.478
He had a couple of scenes
with Matt Damon.

32:23.555 --> 32:25.045
What happened?

32:25.657 --> 32:28.751
Blew it. Couldn't remember
his lines, they replaced him.

32:28.827 --> 32:31.455
Now he can hardly
handle an audition.

32:32.731 --> 32:36.223
Did something happen to him
to throw him off his game?

32:38.837 --> 32:41.897
The night before, Mike went
to help him run his lines.

32:42.874 --> 32:45.069
Mike got really bad
food poisoning.

32:45.143 --> 32:47.270
Ed spent the whole night
in the E.R. With him.

32:47.345 --> 32:50.178
He hadn't rehearsed,
he was tired.

32:51.583 --> 32:53.813
Mike must've felt
bad about that.

32:54.252 --> 32:58.518
Not really. He said it was Ed's
own fault for blowing his big break.

32:59.424 --> 33:01.892
Mike said that would
never happen to him.

33:02.927 --> 33:06.192
But he still hasn't
gotten his big break.

33:06.898 --> 33:10.732
He used to say he'd be better off
having a building fall on top of him.

33:10.802 --> 33:13.965
He said nothing
spells money like pain.

33:14.039 --> 33:16.735
Like the people
on cable talk shows.

33:16.808 --> 33:18.867
The celebrity victims,
Mike called them.

33:22.814 --> 33:24.008
Next.

33:25.517 --> 33:27.144
How'd it go?

33:27.218 --> 33:28.708
They said I got
too much exposure.

33:29.654 --> 33:31.178
People are gonna recognize me
and think of Dana,

33:31.256 --> 33:34.521
and that'll ruin their enjoyment
of the show or something.

33:35.927 --> 33:37.121
Idiots.

33:38.663 --> 33:41.359
I'm so sorry, Mike.
That's not fair.

33:43.435 --> 33:45.027
Hey, did they already
cast the bit parts?

33:45.103 --> 33:47.094
They didn't have
anything for you, Ed.

33:47.205 --> 33:48.194
I tried.

33:48.273 --> 33:50.207
I know you did. It's cool.

33:52.377 --> 33:54.140
Syrup of ipecac?

33:54.212 --> 33:56.737
Yeah, it's used to induce
vomiting in poisoning cases.

33:56.815 --> 33:59.807
Did the doctors at San Diego
General test Mr. Pike to confirm?

33:59.884 --> 34:04.253
No, but Mike admitted he'd taken it after
he refused to let them pump his stomach.

34:04.322 --> 34:06.290
He made himself sick
to sabotage his buddy.

34:06.358 --> 34:08.485
Only room for one star
in Mike's world.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.154
I'd like to see
that star snuffed out.

34:11.228 --> 34:15.893
We need to find a contact in Los
Angeles, someone in the film business.

34:16.534 --> 34:18.364
I'm still friendly with the
Police Commissioner out there.

34:18.436 --> 34:19.766
He might know a few people.

34:19.838 --> 34:22.101
What did you have
in mind, Detective?

34:23.174 --> 34:25.233
Private screening for two.

34:26.277 --> 34:28.040
You mean, the cigarette thing?

34:28.112 --> 34:30.741
I saw somebody smoking
like that outside a bar.

34:30.815 --> 34:33.340
I'm always observing, you
know, looking for new behavior.

34:35.085 --> 34:36.553
Remember him?

34:37.455 --> 34:40.150
<i>He has a lot of that
behavior you like.</i>

34:40.225 --> 34:41.248
<i>I've never seen him.</i>

34:41.326 --> 34:42.485
<i>That's funny.</i>

34:42.560 --> 34:44.652
<i>He was on the set
of the movie you worked on...</i>

34:44.728 --> 34:46.492
We picked him up an hour ago.

34:46.563 --> 34:50.125
<i>Johnny here works for a
company that supplies the guns,</i>

34:50.969 --> 34:52.458
like this one.

34:52.536 --> 34:55.370
We found it buried
in Harriman State Park.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.600
That's where
Kelly goes hiking.

34:56.674 --> 34:57.732
That's true.

34:57.809 --> 35:00.334
<i>No, see, Ed,
you buried it.</i>

35:00.412 --> 35:04.178
<i>You followed Kelly up there, you
taped a GPS locater to her car.</i>

35:04.249 --> 35:05.238
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

35:05.316 --> 35:07.546
<i>And after you shot
Dana and Mike,</i>

35:07.619 --> 35:11.715
<i>you went back to the place Kelly'd
been and you buried the gun there.</i>

35:12.290 --> 35:13.314
<i>I didn't do that.</i>

35:13.391 --> 35:15.916
Your friend's being charged
with murder and attempted murder.

35:15.994 --> 35:18.622
<i>It was you on the corner,
Ed. I don't believe it.</i>

35:18.696 --> 35:20.994
<i>In the black hoodie,
faking the limp.</i>

35:21.065 --> 35:23.966
He was angry at Dana
for coming between you.

35:24.469 --> 35:29.532
<i>In fact, you were the best Ratso
Rizzo San Diego State's ever seen.</i>

35:32.243 --> 35:33.972
How come he doesn't
have a lawyer?

35:34.045 --> 35:35.512
He didn't ask for one.

35:36.281 --> 35:39.182
But he doesn't think that
he needs one. He's innocent.

35:39.250 --> 35:42.276
I'm telling you, he looks out
for me. I wanna get him a lawyer.

35:42.353 --> 35:44.412
I'll call Legal Aid
and see who's available.

35:44.489 --> 35:46.980
We'll have a lawyer here
in half an hour.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.487
Shouldn't somebody tell Ed?

35:52.797 --> 35:55.357
Well, you could tell him.

35:56.334 --> 35:59.633
Right? He could tell him,
right? Unless there's a problem.

36:01.172 --> 36:02.400
Come on.

36:06.311 --> 36:08.279
Mike, what are
you doing here?

36:08.346 --> 36:10.576
It's okay, buddy,
I got you a lawyer.

36:10.648 --> 36:12.206
What for?
I didn't do anything.

36:12.283 --> 36:13.807
I know,
but you need a lawyer.

36:13.885 --> 36:16.046
They're saying I shot Dana,
and then I shot you.

36:16.120 --> 36:19.749
Don't worry about it, Mike. He
believes you. He's not on our side.

36:21.025 --> 36:23.789
UAW, right, Mike?
Us against the world?

36:25.330 --> 36:27.696
That's right. We've been
through a lot together.

36:27.765 --> 36:31.496
But it's been tough sledding
since you moved here, right?

36:31.569 --> 36:36.029
Not a lot of acting gigs on
your résumés, especially you, Ed.

36:36.674 --> 36:38.301
In fact, not any.

36:39.310 --> 36:41.244
It just takes time.
Ed knows that.

36:41.312 --> 36:43.337
Picking up for you, though,
Mike, right?

36:43.414 --> 36:47.817
I mean, you got your face on
the cover of all the city papers,

36:47.886 --> 36:50.684
and you were on the news.

36:50.755 --> 36:53.383
I can't believe you think I'd
profit from this horrible tragedy.

36:53.458 --> 36:54.482
I lost my fiancée!

36:54.559 --> 36:58.495
Yeah, but you got a new agent
and bunch of auditions.

36:58.563 --> 37:00.690
You did him a solid, Ed,
shooting Dana.

37:00.765 --> 37:02.426
I didn't shoot Dana!

37:02.500 --> 37:06.266
Did you think you were gonna get a
taste of it, you know, his newfound fame?

37:06.337 --> 37:07.326
Mike.

37:07.405 --> 37:09.202
Just be cool, Ed,
I'm backing you up.

37:09.274 --> 37:11.469
Gotta love
that UAW spirit.

37:12.677 --> 37:13.905
It must have been tough
for you, though, right?

37:13.978 --> 37:16.640
I mean, supporting him,
getting him the parts,

37:16.714 --> 37:20.878
and, you know, especially
after crapping out in San Diego.

37:21.586 --> 37:24.146
You know, on that big
movie set with Matt Damon.

37:29.127 --> 37:30.685
Did you really
run off the set?

37:30.762 --> 37:32.889
He got stage fright.
It happens to everyone.

37:32.964 --> 37:36.730
Even Laurence Olivier, he used
to puke before every performance.

37:36.801 --> 37:39.929
Did Laurence Olivier
ever do this?

37:42.473 --> 37:44.566
<i>Rolling.
Speed.</i>

37:44.642 --> 37:47.475
<i>Scene 38 B,
take three.</i>

37:47.545 --> 37:48.603
<i>Action!</i>

37:51.683 --> 37:55.847
<i>You're really gonna like this room, Mr.
Reid, it's got a great view of the...</i>

37:58.423 --> 37:59.720
<i>It's got a great view
of the...</i>

37:59.791 --> 38:00.815
<i>Cut!</i>

38:01.426 --> 38:03.451
<i>Rolling.
Speed.</i>

38:03.528 --> 38:05.758
<i>Scene 38 B, take five.</i>

38:05.830 --> 38:06.888
<i>Action.</i>

38:08.700 --> 38:11.225
<i>You're really gonna
like this view...</i>

38:12.570 --> 38:13.867
<i>Damn!</i>

38:13.938 --> 38:16.202
<i>All right, keep rolling.
Keep rolling, all right?</i>

38:16.274 --> 38:19.971
<i>No, no, it's cool, it's cool. We've
got plenty of film, plenty of film.</i>

38:20.044 --> 38:23.275
<i>It's Ed, right? Hey, can
we get Ed a water, please?</i>

38:27.118 --> 38:29.109
<i>Whenever you're ready.</i>

38:29.187 --> 38:31.587
<i>Okay, let's go. Action!</i>

38:32.924 --> 38:35.950
<i>You're really gonna
like this room, Mr. Damon.</i>

38:39.564 --> 38:41.532
<i>I can't believe
I called you...</i>

38:42.734 --> 38:44.725
<i>All right,
just relax. This is totally...</i>

38:44.802 --> 38:46.793
<i>We're just having fun, man.
We're just having fun.</i>

38:46.871 --> 38:49.431
He doesn't have to go
through this again, all right?

38:51.009 --> 38:53.239
What is it called?
Method acting.

38:53.311 --> 38:56.872
I just wanted him to remember
what it felt like that day.

38:56.948 --> 38:58.575
Never forgot it.

38:59.083 --> 39:00.072
<i>Rolling!</i>

39:00.151 --> 39:01.584
<i>Scene 38 B, take 13.</i>

39:01.953 --> 39:03.147
<i>Action!</i>

39:04.522 --> 39:06.046
<i>You're gonna...</i>

39:07.792 --> 39:09.350
<i>You're really gonna...</i>

39:09.994 --> 39:12.189
<i>On your own time,
whenever you want.</i>

39:12.964 --> 39:14.226
<i>You're...</i>

39:15.533 --> 39:16.830
<i>You're...</i>

39:18.102 --> 39:21.697
<i>One more time.
From the top. Action!</i>

39:35.019 --> 39:36.509
<i>Where's he going?</i>

39:36.587 --> 39:38.384
<i>Hey,
is he coming back?</i>

39:38.456 --> 39:40.185
<i>I'm sorry
about this, Matt.</i>

39:40.258 --> 39:41.384
<i>Cut!</i>

39:41.459 --> 39:45.225
And after that, you couldn't get
arrested. Nobody would hire you.

39:45.296 --> 39:46.354
That's so uncalled for!

39:46.431 --> 39:48.456
How would you handle that?

39:48.533 --> 39:50.467
Mike, I mean,
assuming you got a big break,

39:50.535 --> 39:53.663
you know, like you get on a
big movie or a big movie star...

39:53.738 --> 39:56.298
Like I said, it's a matter of
time. And Ed will get another shot.

39:56.374 --> 39:58.934
Even if he has to
wait 25-to-life.

40:02.246 --> 40:03.611
Time to go.

40:04.949 --> 40:07.747
Be cool. The lawyer will be
here soon. I'll be just outside.

40:07.819 --> 40:10.049
You know, like when
you stuck with him

40:11.222 --> 40:14.749
when you got the
food poisoning, remember?

40:19.464 --> 40:23.696
You remember? You know,
the hospital in San Diego?

40:27.805 --> 40:29.796
They dug up this report.

40:34.178 --> 40:37.170
You should read the parts
that we highlighted.

40:40.017 --> 40:44.647
Ipecac, Ed. Two drops of that on
your tongue and it makes you vomit.

40:46.157 --> 40:49.888
He made himself sick.
He made you stay up with him.

40:54.465 --> 40:55.762
That's 'cause
he couldn't handle

40:55.833 --> 40:57.767
the thought of you
getting a break before him.

40:57.835 --> 41:01.794
That would be unsupportive, like
Kelly turning her lens away from him.

41:01.873 --> 41:02.862
That's not true.

41:02.940 --> 41:05.067
Dana going to the premiere
without him.

41:05.143 --> 41:06.838
Mike?
This is...

41:06.911 --> 41:09.846
Hey, no, listen, don't.
Listen...

41:09.914 --> 41:11.506
Don't go there, Ed.
He destroyed you.

41:11.582 --> 41:12.571
He destroyed you!
Don't go there.

41:12.650 --> 41:14.845
He destroyed your confidence!

41:17.221 --> 41:18.552
What about now?
How do you feel now?

41:18.623 --> 41:22.423
All right, you know what, Ed? It was
a stupid and petty thing to do, Ed.

41:22.493 --> 41:23.619
How do you
feel about it now?

41:23.694 --> 41:25.924
I'm sorry! Can you
count on his support now?

41:26.264 --> 41:30.997
You bought the gun, you used it, you
buried it. He's putting it all on you.

41:32.336 --> 41:33.963
Because that's his new role.

41:34.038 --> 41:37.201
He's... He's the
loyal friend, you know.

41:37.275 --> 41:43.407
Had his happiness shattered by the
envy of his talentless sidekick.

41:44.582 --> 41:48.575
It's not as sexy as his
ex-girlfriend stalking him, but...

41:49.387 --> 41:51.878
Don't listen, Ed! Don't you listen!
Don't let him go out the door.

41:51.956 --> 41:55.915
Don't let him go out the door.
He goes out that door, he's gone.

41:57.295 --> 42:00.196
He's off to market
his own misery, you know?

42:00.932 --> 42:04.026
Don't do it, Ed. Don't
let him do it again to you.

42:05.303 --> 42:07.168
<i>You're really gonna...</i>

42:08.606 --> 42:09.800
<i>You're gonna...</i>

42:09.874 --> 42:10.898
<i>Keep rolling!</i>

42:10.975 --> 42:13.000
You know what? Turn this
damn thing off. Turn it off!

42:13.077 --> 42:14.408
It was his idea!
It was his idea!

42:14.478 --> 42:15.809
Turn this off!

42:15.880 --> 42:16.904
He was gonna be famous!

42:16.981 --> 42:17.970
That's a lie!

42:18.049 --> 42:20.415
You did it. You shot her!
I had nothing to do with it!

42:20.484 --> 42:22.179
That heirloom ring?

42:22.253 --> 42:23.743
He had me go out to
New Jersey to get it,

42:23.821 --> 42:25.413
put it on a payment plan
so he could return it.

42:25.489 --> 42:26.581
No. That's good enough for us.

42:26.657 --> 42:28.022
Mike, you're under arrest.

42:28.092 --> 42:30.026
No! No, no, no, no!
This doesn't count!

42:30.094 --> 42:32.961
He asked for a lawyer. His lawyer's
not here! That one doesn't count!

42:33.030 --> 42:36.989
He didn't, you did, and you don't have
standing to invoke his right to counsel.

42:39.003 --> 42:42.370
Amateur. You're an amateur!
You know what?

42:42.440 --> 42:45.000
You know, they'd have cut
you out of that movie anyway!

42:45.076 --> 42:46.907
He did it! He did it!

42:48.412 --> 42:49.936
That's not true.

42:50.815 --> 42:54.717
I came up with good stuff for that scene.
I had this thing where I opened the curtain,

42:55.720 --> 42:58.883
but I just went blank.
Just blank.

43:06.063 --> 43:08.531
If only he'd gone blank
on that street corner.

43:08.599 --> 43:12.262
Oh. But then they wouldn't
get to be celebrity perps.
