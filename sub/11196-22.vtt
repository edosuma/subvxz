Previously on Stargate SG-1:

00:08.550 --> 00:10.969
- Whom do you serve?
- (distorted) Anubis.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.346
He is dead!

00:12.471 --> 00:17.226
That was what you assumed
after you attempted to murder him.

00:18.268 --> 00:24.483
His hand was exposed to the equivalent
of eight to nine grays of neutron radiation.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.361
It's a lethal dose, sir.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.988
I'm gonna miss you guys.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.198
Yeah.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.660
You too.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

01:02.104 --> 01:04.897
The ship is Asgard. We are being hailed.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.654
I am Thor, supreme commander
of the Asgard fleet.

01:10.779 --> 01:14.366
Your presence here is a violation
of the Protected Planets Treaty,

01:14.491 --> 01:16.994
and you must withdraw immediately.

01:17.119 --> 01:19.162
I don't think so.

01:20.122 --> 01:23.250
If you do not comply,
I will be forced to open fire.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.544
Yes, I suppose you will.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.172
You will be destroyed.

01:28.297 --> 01:32.968
I am the great god Osiris,
and gods cannot be destroyed.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.180
- You should know that.
- Very well.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.474
Enemy ship is powering weapons.

01:52.196 --> 01:55.949
Shields are holding.
The ship remains undamaged.

01:56.074 --> 01:59.786
Our days of bowing to the Asgard
are finally over.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.154
Major.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.572
Sir.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.827
I just wanted to inform you
that Colonel O'Neill requests

04:03.952 --> 04:09.374
that SG-1 remain on active duty while we
try to find a replacement for Dr Jackson.

04:09.499 --> 04:13.045
What are we supposed to do?
Keep working like nothing happened?

04:13.170 --> 04:15.547
I understand how you feel.

04:16.380 --> 04:20.844
With all due respect, sir,
I don't even understand how I feel.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.847
We didn't even have a memorial service.

04:23.972 --> 04:28.060
- We're not even really sure he's dead.
- And that's the problem.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.563
What are we supposed to do, sir?

04:32.356 --> 04:38.070
Wait and hope that he comes back,
or... or just move on?

04:42.157 --> 04:47.120
When I was in Vietnam,
I saw my best friend shot down.

04:48.497 --> 04:53.168
I know he survived.
I saw his chute open, radioed his position.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.380
But I never found out
what happened to him.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.882
His body was never recovered.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.719
The Vietnamese never admitted
they took him prisoner.

05:02.845 --> 05:10.018
For years I kept thinking that someday
he's just going to walk through the door.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.230
So what did you do?

05:14.690 --> 05:17.192
I learned to live with it.

05:18.277 --> 05:21.488
- Unauthorised offworld activation.
- (alarm)

05:22.698 --> 05:26.201
- What the hell's going on?
- Main power's down.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.414
Phones are down.

05:30.539 --> 05:34.209
General Hammond to the gate room.
General Hammond to the gate room.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.378
Let's get up there.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.601
(alarm continues)

05:57.065 --> 05:58.859
Stand down.

05:58.984 --> 06:02.404
- Freyr.
- Major Carter, General Hammond.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.448
I apologise for our absence of late,

06:04.573 --> 06:07.951
but our war with the replicators
has reached a critical stage.

06:08.076 --> 06:12.456
- We might be able to help you with that.
- Yes, we received your message.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.375
lf, as you say,
this android was responsible

06:15.501 --> 06:20.297
for creating the first generation of
replicators, it may well prove invaluable.

06:20.422 --> 06:24.510
However, that is not
the only reason I have come.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.846
There has been an incident
with the Goa'uld.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.806
An incident?

06:29.932 --> 06:32.059
Commander Thor has been killed.

06:35.354 --> 06:39.149
- Killed? How?
- The Goa'uld attacked a protected planet

06:39.274 --> 06:42.736
and Commander Thor was dispatched
with the only ship available.

06:42.861 --> 06:47.074
We expected the Goa'uld to retreat once
our presence was felt, but they did not.

06:47.199 --> 06:50.118
The Asgard ship was destroyed
in the ensuing battle.

06:50.244 --> 06:54.122
Is not Asgard military technology
far superior to that of the Goa'uld?

06:54.248 --> 06:57.209
Their new shields are more
advanced than we believed,

06:57.334 --> 07:00.462
and it appears they have upgraded
their weapons as well.

07:00.587 --> 07:04.466
We can no longer be confident of victory
when facing superior numbers.

07:04.591 --> 07:08.679
So, in other words, the protected planets
are no longer protected.

07:08.804 --> 07:12.474
- Including Earth.
- Our ability to enforce the treaty

07:12.599 --> 07:16.436
will depend greatly on the outcome
of our battle with the replicators.

07:16.562 --> 07:20.899
However, in the meantime,
we do have another problem.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.569
An Asgard scientist is stranded

07:23.694 --> 07:27.322
in the research facility beneath
the surface of the planet in question.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.158
We would like you
to mount a rescue mission.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.536
Why us?

07:32.661 --> 07:34.913
We have no ships available.

07:35.038 --> 07:38.458
We understand you have
a Goa'uld cargo ship at your disposal.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.879
Well, it isn't exactly
in perfect working order.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.256
We managed to repair it, but...

07:44.381 --> 07:46.592
We'll do it.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.097
It's what we do, isn't it?

07:52.222 --> 07:56.560
The research being conducted on this
planet is vital to the future of the Asgard.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.605
We would be for ever in your debt.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.489
Colonel. We need to talk.

08:09.615 --> 08:11.450
I don't wanna hear it, Carter.

08:11.575 --> 08:15.204
- You can't pretend this didn't happen.
- I'm not pretending anything.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.789
This is the job.
We lose people all the time.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.791
We're talking about Daniel.

08:19.917 --> 08:24.129
What do you want me to do?
He's gone. We've got work to do.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.479
Are you not all right, Major Carter?

09:22.604 --> 09:24.648
I'm fine.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.610
You continue to mourn
the loss of Daniel Jackson.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.613
Yeah, I do. Tell me I'm not the only one.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.829
I will perform the proper rituals
when the opportunity presents itself.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.623
Until that time,
this mission must take priority.

09:41.707 --> 09:46.211
Please, Teal'c. I get enough of that "way
of the warrior" crap from Colonel O'Neill.

09:46.336 --> 09:49.756
Daniel Jackson has ascended
to a higher plane of existence.

09:49.882 --> 09:53.177
Many Jaffa dedicate their lives
to achieving such a goal.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.554
So I'm supposed to celebrate?

09:57.723 --> 09:59.892
It is a great accomplishment.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.522
We were a team, Teal'c.

10:06.690 --> 10:10.319
No one can even begin to understand
what we went through together,

10:10.444 --> 10:12.696
what we mean to each other.

10:13.447 --> 10:18.785
So maybe Daniel has achieved something
of great cosmic significance. I don't know.

10:18.911 --> 10:22.456
And to be honest with you,
right now I don't really care.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.667
I'd rather have him back.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.215
As would I.

10:41.225 --> 10:45.354
We are approaching the Adara system.
Two motherships orbit the second planet.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.482
We can't activate the cloak
until we're out of hyperspace.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.193
For a brief interval they could detect us.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.986
- How brief?
- A few seconds.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.197
The odds of them spotting us are slim.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.616
- How slim?
- Hardly worth mentioning.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.327
And yet... you did mention it.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.663
Yeah. I'm beginning to wish I hadn't.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.760
Well, at least they're not shooting at us.
That's good.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.263
We are approaching
the upper atmosphere.

11:26.270 --> 11:30.274
- It's pretty thick.
- There is considerable turbulence.

11:34.194 --> 11:38.115
You know, we should consider
putting another chair back here.

11:39.908 --> 11:43.787
When you think about it,
it'd be much safer, wouldn't it?

11:51.753 --> 11:55.841
We have arrived at the coordinates
given to us by Freyr.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.892
- Nice view.
- (Carter) This can't be right.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.686
The atmosphere
is over 80%% % carbon dioxide

12:07.769 --> 12:11.815
and the surface temperature
is 420Â° Fahrenheit.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.151
Ooh. Hot.

12:16.195 --> 12:18.030
Yeah.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.535
How are we to locate the Asgard facility?

12:27.206 --> 12:29.374
Well, that was easy.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.680
Ah, humans. Interesting.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.352
Greetings.

12:48.477 --> 12:53.065
I am Heimdall. I assume you were sent
by the Asgard High Council.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.318
Not exactly.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.905
Uh, Colonel Jack O'Neill,
Major Carter and Teal'c.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.788
I have heard much of your exploits
on behalf of the Asgard.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.998
Dr Jackson is not with you?

13:12.793 --> 13:14.920
Uh, no.

13:15.379 --> 13:17.756
In any case,
it is a great pleasure to meet you.

13:17.881 --> 13:20.008
Where are we exactly?

13:20.634 --> 13:23.512
Several hundred metres
beneath the surface.

13:23.637 --> 13:27.683
Of course. We'd have to be -
the surface is uninhabitable.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.436
The Goa'uld are unaware
of your presence?

13:31.562 --> 13:33.814
I am monitoring their communications.

13:33.939 --> 13:39.027
They know the laboratory exists, but they
have been unable to pinpoint its location.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.281
Well, why don't we get out of here
before they find out?

13:42.406 --> 13:44.241
I'm afraid we cannot leave.

13:44.366 --> 13:47.160
- Why not?
- First we must rescue Thor.

13:48.287 --> 13:50.247
I thought Thor was dead.

13:50.372 --> 13:54.543
He is not. However,
his life is in grave danger.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.670
He is a prisoner of the Goa'uld.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.364
Commander Thor.

14:24.489 --> 14:28.994
I apologise for the accommodations,
but we weren't expecting company.

14:29.119 --> 14:32.456
You have committed
an act of war against the Asgard.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.875
The response will be swift and decisive.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.254
As swift and decisive
as your attempt to defend this planet?

14:40.589 --> 14:44.092
After Thor's ship was destroyed,
the Goa'uld detected an escape pod.

14:44.218 --> 14:47.429
They retrieved it before
it could disappear into the atmosphere.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.389
How do you know Thor is alive?

14:49.515 --> 14:53.227
I am able to scan the interior
of the Goa'uld mothership.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.023
Wow.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.859
I have located Thor's biosignature here.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.572
Why not just beam him out?

15:05.697 --> 15:09.826
My sensors can penetrate their shields,
but my transportation device cannot.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.246
Can you detect Goa'uld life signs as well?

15:12.371 --> 15:14.414
I can.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.963
- Thor is not alone.
- The red dot indicates a symbiote.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.173
So it's a Goa'uld or a Jaffa.

15:23.298 --> 15:27.678
In all probability, Thor is being tortured
for information about Asgard technology.

15:27.803 --> 15:31.849
With that knowledge, the Goa'uld
could easily come through our Stargate.

15:31.974 --> 15:35.227
There wouldn't be anything
we could do about it.

15:36.270 --> 15:41.191
I underestimated your strength.
That mistake will not be made again.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.443
Perhaps not.

15:43.569 --> 15:47.406
But next time we'll have
an even greater advantage.

15:49.032 --> 15:53.412
We'll have learned all your secrets.

15:54.538 --> 15:57.207
I will never surrender
my knowledge to you.

15:57.332 --> 16:02.421
Not to me, no. Anubis himself
has taken an interest in this matter.

16:07.342 --> 16:09.845
He's on his way here as we speak.

16:23.025 --> 16:25.360
The Goa'uld is leaving.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.781
Can you communicate with him?

16:30.616 --> 16:32.659
Yes, I can.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.380
Thor?

16:48.217 --> 16:50.260
Thor? Buddy?

16:54.097 --> 16:58.310
- Hey. How you doin'?
- O'Neill. I am surprised to see you.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.146
Yeah. We're down on the planet with...

17:01.271 --> 17:03.774
- Heimdall.
- Yeah, him.

17:03.899 --> 17:06.151
Working on a way
of getting you out of here.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.278
That would be unwise.

17:08.403 --> 17:12.366
You must take Heimdall and his research
materials and leave immediately.

17:12.657 --> 17:15.786
What, are you nuts?
We're not gonna leave you behind.

17:15.911 --> 17:18.121
(Thor) More Goa'uld are coming.

17:18.247 --> 17:21.834
I have been informed that Anubis
will conduct my interrogation.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.336
All the more reason to get you out.

17:24.461 --> 17:27.589
I will resist their attempts
to probe my mind.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.676
I will die before
I give them any information.

17:30.801 --> 17:35.931
But the very survival of the Asgard
depends on Heimdall's discoveries.

17:39.476 --> 17:43.188
Sir, you've got company.
We're gonna have to pull you out.

17:43.939 --> 17:47.067
All right, listen. I gotta go. But I'll be back.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.910
- How's he doing?
- Well, he's fine for now.

17:57.035 --> 18:00.205
Except for the fact
that he wants us to leave him behind.

18:00.330 --> 18:04.251
- For what reason?
- I wouldn't mind knowing that myself.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.880
Thor is concerned that if we delay,

18:08.005 --> 18:12.885
the materials in this laboratory
will fall into the hands of the Goa'uld.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.970
What exactly are you studying?

18:15.095 --> 18:18.140
I am researching
the genetic history of the Asgard.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.852
Yeah, now see, that doesn't sound
like something worth dying for.

18:21.977 --> 18:25.564
That is because you do not understand
the gravity of the situation.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.566
Feel free to enlighten us.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.860
As a race, the Asgard reproduce

18:29.985 --> 18:33.572
exclusively through a process
of enhanced cellular mitosis.

18:33.697 --> 18:36.617
Are you serious? You have
no other means of propagation?

18:36.742 --> 18:37.743
No.

18:41.371 --> 18:44.374
- Carter?
- They're clones, sir. All of them.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.503
Ah.

18:47.628 --> 18:49.880
Well, that answers a few questions.

18:51.507 --> 18:53.967
In fact, for nearly a thousand years

18:54.092 --> 18:58.931
we have been physically incapable
of achieving cell division through meiosis.

18:59.056 --> 19:00.098
Hm?

19:00.224 --> 19:02.226
Sexual reproduction, sir.

19:02.768 --> 19:05.145
Ah.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.397
A thousand years?

19:07.523 --> 19:12.110
It is not something
we usually discuss with other races.

19:12.778 --> 19:14.363
This I understand.

19:14.488 --> 19:17.616
Through cloning, we have achieved
a measure of immortality.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.785
As each Asgard's body fails,

19:19.910 --> 19:23.997
his consciousness is transferred
into a newer, younger version of himself.

19:24.122 --> 19:28.710
Unfortunately, the lack of genetic diversity
has become a problem.

19:28.836 --> 19:33.882
It's like making a copy of a copy of
a copy. Eventually there's deterioration.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.343
We created a process
of controlled mutation,

19:36.468 --> 19:39.638
which has helped us to avoid
complete genetic breakdown.

19:39.763 --> 19:42.891
But we are at the limits
of our technical capabilities.

19:43.016 --> 19:46.186
The truth is, the Asgard are a dying race.

19:56.238 --> 19:59.616
- Have you located the Asgard facility?
- Not yet, my lord.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.368
We waste time.

20:01.493 --> 20:05.539
Lord Yu is mounting an offensive.
Our ships are needed elsewhere.

20:05.664 --> 20:09.543
The planet's atmosphere generates
much electromagnetic interference.

20:09.668 --> 20:12.171
Then send a squadron of gliders.

20:12.296 --> 20:15.591
At low altitude their sensors
will be more effective.

20:15.716 --> 20:20.554
The atmosphere is too thick.
It'd be extremely dangerous for the pilots.

20:21.805 --> 20:24.850
And how dangerous will it be
when Lord Anubis arrives

20:24.975 --> 20:28.061
and you have nothing
to offer but excuses?

20:29.146 --> 20:31.732
I will dispatch the squadron myself.

20:31.857 --> 20:33.901
Very wise.

20:35.944 --> 20:40.157
If Anubis is gonna interrogate Thor,
he'll have to ring aboard the ship.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.951
Once they lower the shields,
we can beam Thor out.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.037
The shields will not be lowered.

20:45.162 --> 20:49.082
They will merely adjust the frequency
to accept a ring transmission.

20:49.208 --> 20:52.044
Then we beam up from
the cargo ship at the same time.

20:52.169 --> 20:56.757
Once Anubis is on board, the frequency
will be readjusted and we will be trapped.

20:57.174 --> 21:00.511
So we take out the shields
from the inside. There.

21:02.095 --> 21:05.307
The shield-generator room
is located here.

21:05.682 --> 21:09.770
You can use explosives to disable it
and I will transport everyone out.

21:09.895 --> 21:13.106
Once the rings are activated,
the Goa'uld will be aware of us.

21:13.232 --> 21:15.901
One of us stays here
and uses the Asgard scanner

21:15.984 --> 21:18.862
to direct the others away
from any guards or patrols.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.823
First I must complete
my preparations for departure.

21:21.949 --> 21:24.868
OK. Carter, you stay here.
Teal'c and I will go up.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.579
I must remind you
that time is of the essence.

21:27.704 --> 21:31.166
This laboratory will not remain
undetected indefinitely.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.335
Right.

21:48.559 --> 21:50.811
Lord Anubis has arrived.

22:10.497 --> 22:13.166
Sir, we found a ring room that's clear.
Stand by.

22:13.584 --> 22:15.627
Roger that.

22:20.674 --> 22:23.802
- Ring room has been activated.
- Now, sir.

22:58.212 --> 23:00.255
Monitoring your progress, sir.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.424
(beeping)

23:03.800 --> 23:06.178
Unauthorised transport onto the ship.

23:06.303 --> 23:07.721
Intruders?

23:07.846 --> 23:10.599
The signal appears
to have come from the planet.

23:10.724 --> 23:13.852
I am unable to determine
the specific coordinates.

23:13.977 --> 23:19.733
Organise a security detail. Maximum
containment. I want them found.

23:32.162 --> 23:35.123
Proceed to the end of the corridor
and take a right.

23:59.314 --> 24:02.609
Hold up, sir.
There's a large party headed your way.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.904
Which way?
Should we double back, what?

24:08.490 --> 24:12.160
No, sir. There's a corridor ahead
on your left. You can duck in there.

25:01.335 --> 25:03.337
They're almost there.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.842
Uh-oh.

25:13.514 --> 25:15.474
Sir, we've got a problem.

25:15.599 --> 25:19.061
There are several Jaffa patrols
bearing down on your position.

25:19.186 --> 25:23.190
- Where? What direction?
- From all directions, sir. Stand by.

25:30.906 --> 25:32.950
There's no way out.

25:33.617 --> 25:36.828
Perhaps a diversionary tactic
would be in order.

25:43.210 --> 25:45.087
Carter?

25:47.130 --> 25:49.174
Damn it.

26:04.857 --> 26:07.109
Hey, guys! What's happening?

26:28.463 --> 26:30.465
Nice.

26:30.966 --> 26:35.012
- Heimdall says the way ahead is clear.
- Let's move out.

26:55.991 --> 26:58.410
You are the one they call Thor.

26:58.994 --> 27:01.330
I am Anubis.

27:01.455 --> 27:05.584
As I have told your lieutenant,
I will reveal nothing to you.

27:07.127 --> 27:11.715
This device... will be implanted
into your brain.

27:13.926 --> 27:18.138
It will form a link between your mind
and the ship's computer.

27:19.348 --> 27:23.685
Your knowledge will simply be
downloaded into our memory banks.

27:24.478 --> 27:26.688
You will no doubt resist.

27:27.481 --> 27:29.983
And you will no doubt fail.

27:30.108 --> 27:32.903
The Goa'uld possess no such technology.

27:43.121 --> 27:47.501
I think you will find many things
have changed since my return.

28:04.059 --> 28:06.353
The intruders have
breached our perimeter.

28:06.478 --> 28:07.479
How?

28:07.604 --> 28:10.107
One of our patrols was ambushed.

28:12.359 --> 28:13.819
Seal the lower decks

28:13.944 --> 28:18.532
and divert coolant from the hyperdrive
into the ventilation system.

28:18.657 --> 28:22.286
- The gas is toxic.
- Only with prolonged exposure.

28:22.953 --> 28:27.624
- Shall I evacuate the engine room?
- The intruders may be monitoring us.

28:27.749 --> 28:31.211
- We cannot give them a warning.
- But the engines will overheat.

28:31.336 --> 28:34.840
The entire compartment
will be flooded with radiation.

28:34.965 --> 28:39.720
- Many Jaffa will die.
- And be greatly honoured in the afterlife.

28:59.615 --> 29:01.033
Carter?

29:01.158 --> 29:05.412
This is it, sir. The shield-generator room
is on the other side of that door.

29:05.537 --> 29:08.874
- There are six Jaffa inside.
- Only six?

29:10.501 --> 29:12.377
(gas hissing)

29:13.629 --> 29:15.464
Colonel! Teal'c!

29:23.222 --> 29:25.057
Colonel!

29:32.856 --> 29:36.735
- Are you sure they're not injured?
- Their signals remain strong.

29:37.069 --> 29:40.405
They appear to have been taken
to some kind of holding cell.

29:40.531 --> 29:43.700
- Well, we've gotta get them out of there.
- How?

29:45.285 --> 29:48.372
- I'm not sure yet.
- In the meantime, we must do all we can

29:48.497 --> 29:53.752
to keep the materials in this laboratory
from falling into Goa'uld hands.

29:53.877 --> 29:57.256
What exactly are we talking about here?
Some DNA samples?

29:58.382 --> 30:00.425
Not exactly.

30:23.782 --> 30:26.910
- What is it?
- That is one of my ancestors.

30:27.411 --> 30:30.789
30,000 years ago, a ship was launched
from the Asgard home world,

30:30.914 --> 30:33.292
its crew placed in suspended animation.

30:34.126 --> 30:37.671
There was a failure in the navigational
system and the ship was lost.

30:37.796 --> 30:42.509
It drifted across the empty expanse
between our galaxies until it arrived here.

30:42.634 --> 30:46.805
- We discovered it six months ago.
- And this is one of its original crew?

30:46.930 --> 30:49.850
The only one
that was perfectly preserved.

30:49.975 --> 30:54.313
He is from a time before our genetic
manipulation became irreversible.

30:54.813 --> 30:57.065
So that's why he's so important.

30:57.191 --> 31:02.446
You hope his physiology can give you
clues to stave off genetic degradation.

31:03.572 --> 31:08.535
We kept the laboratory in this galaxy
to avoid the threat of the replicators.

31:10.996 --> 31:13.457
Now we can no longer afford to wait.

31:13.582 --> 31:17.461
It is only a matter of time before
the Goa'uld pinpoint our location.

31:26.637 --> 31:31.183
I will require your assistance to adapt
the stasis pod to the ship's power supply.

31:31.308 --> 31:34.895
All right. But when we're done
I want you to beam me back to the lab.

31:35.020 --> 31:39.274
I'm not ready to give up
on Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c just yet.

31:49.743 --> 31:51.870
I can't believe they took my watch.

31:54.957 --> 31:59.002
Major Carter will soon have no choice
but to leave with Heimdall.

31:59.127 --> 32:02.172
If she's smart, she's already gone.

32:02.297 --> 32:05.300
In which case
our chances of escape are negligible.

32:05.425 --> 32:08.846
Oh, I don't know.
All we gotta do is bust out of here,

32:08.971 --> 32:11.723
take out every Jaffa
between here and the peltak,

32:11.849 --> 32:15.227
commandeer the ship and fly on home.

32:16.895 --> 32:19.064
I stand corrected.

32:20.107 --> 32:22.150
O'Neill?

32:22.985 --> 32:25.195
Thor? Is that you?

32:27.447 --> 32:30.534
- Where are you?
- I am still in my cell.

32:30.659 --> 32:34.788
However, my mind has been linked
with the ship's computer.

32:34.913 --> 32:39.751
I am using the internal communication
system to synthesise my voice.

32:40.961 --> 32:42.129
OK.

32:42.254 --> 32:47.634
The Goa'uld are attempting to download
information from my prefrontal cortex.

32:47.759 --> 32:51.930
It is only a matter of time before
they break through my mental defences.

32:52.055 --> 32:56.185
Well, you know, love to help you,
but we've got our own problems here.

32:56.310 --> 32:58.854
I am aware of your situation.

32:58.979 --> 33:04.318
I may be able to rewrite some minor
subroutines in the security protocol.

33:04.401 --> 33:07.362
- To what end?
- (rumbling)

33:12.242 --> 33:14.161
Sweet.

33:14.286 --> 33:18.874
I am growing weak. Further
communication will be impossible.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.877
Hang tight. We'll get you out.

33:37.726 --> 33:39.853
Colonel.

33:40.812 --> 33:42.856
- Still with us, huh?
- Yes, sir.

33:42.981 --> 33:45.817
Heimdall's got the cargo ship
prepped and ready to go.

33:45.943 --> 33:50.697
He can beam us straight there, but we
still need you to get those shields offline.

33:50.822 --> 33:54.952
Yeah, well, they took our C4,
so we won't be blowing any stuff up.

33:55.077 --> 33:57.829
We have to find a control relay
and pull the crystals.

33:57.955 --> 34:01.250
It'll only buy us a few seconds,
but that should be all we need.

34:01.375 --> 34:03.502
Right. Which way?

34:03.627 --> 34:06.463
I'll have to step off the holopad to check.

34:06.588 --> 34:09.675
Try to stay out of sight.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

34:16.389 --> 34:18.391
Report.

34:18.516 --> 34:22.271
The battle with Lord Yu does not go well.
We request reinforcements.

34:22.396 --> 34:26.733
That stubborn old man
simply refuses to die.

34:28.402 --> 34:30.571
Dispatch the other ships.

34:38.871 --> 34:40.914
Lord Osiris, one of our gliders

34:41.039 --> 34:44.835
has detected an energy signature
beneath the planet's surface.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.504
Do we have specific coordinates?

34:47.629 --> 34:49.965
We do. But there is no way in.

34:50.882 --> 34:54.428
Then we'll just have
to make our own way, won't we?

34:56.679 --> 34:58.473
(Heimdall) What's your situation?

34:58.599 --> 35:02.644
We're working on another way
to get the shields offline.

35:04.354 --> 35:08.525
- What was that?
- I think the Goa'uld made my position.

35:08.650 --> 35:10.611
You should leave immediately.

35:10.736 --> 35:12.946
Just a few more minutes.

35:18.202 --> 35:20.245
Come on, Carter.

35:21.955 --> 35:26.543
I've got it, sir. Go down this corridor
and up two levels. I'll meet you there.

35:26.668 --> 35:28.253
OK.

35:55.072 --> 35:56.156
Carter.

35:56.281 --> 35:59.743
There should be an access panel
somewhere along here.

36:00.702 --> 36:03.372
OK, next time I'm the hologram.

36:17.344 --> 36:20.639
- OK, we just have to pick the right crystal.
- Which one?

36:23.600 --> 36:25.060
Carter?

36:25.185 --> 36:27.437
I thought I heard something.

36:30.274 --> 36:31.692
There's someone in here.

36:31.817 --> 36:33.026
Agh!

37:23.160 --> 37:25.871
- Major Carter.
- Osiris.

37:25.996 --> 37:34.004
We have Colonel O'Neill and the shol'va,
so that just leaves... Dr Jackson.

37:36.048 --> 37:38.967
- Where is he?
- Forget it.

37:47.893 --> 37:50.145
Perhaps we should take them all.

37:52.564 --> 37:54.650
Here's a thought.

38:01.865 --> 38:04.952
Shields are down. Controls are offline.

38:06.495 --> 38:08.830
Repair them.

38:13.919 --> 38:16.004
Once more.

38:16.129 --> 38:18.298
Where is Dr Jackson?

38:21.218 --> 38:22.928
He's dead.

38:25.055 --> 38:27.057
You're lying.

38:27.182 --> 38:29.017
Go to hell.

38:44.241 --> 38:46.702
Get us out of here.

38:46.827 --> 38:48.704
Well done, O'Neill.

38:48.829 --> 38:50.414
Thanks.

38:50.539 --> 38:52.583
Thor? Buddy?

38:54.668 --> 38:58.630
O'Neill. You cannot take me with you.

38:59.423 --> 39:00.591
Why not?

39:00.716 --> 39:05.679
The link between myself and
the Goa'uld ship has not been severed.

39:05.804 --> 39:08.515
They will be able to track our position.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.143
You must leave me behind.

39:11.268 --> 39:14.813
All right, that doesn't work for me.
It's not an option. OK?

39:15.439 --> 39:18.108
Lord Anubis, the Asgard prisoner is gone.

39:18.817 --> 39:20.861
He will not get far.

39:27.826 --> 39:31.455
We've cleared the atmosphere.
Bring up the hyperdrive.

39:34.625 --> 39:37.461
Hyperdrive is offline. Cloak is failing.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.844
Cloak is down. We have lost our shields.

39:47.012 --> 39:48.889
We cannot sustain another hit.

39:49.014 --> 39:51.683
Sir, we're receiving a transmission.

39:51.767 --> 39:55.646
(Anubis) Your ship is defenceless.
You cannot escape.

39:56.605 --> 39:58.649
Surrender now.

40:02.110 --> 40:04.863
- Any ideas?
- We cannot risk capture.

40:04.988 --> 40:07.741
We must destroy the ship ourselves.

40:08.575 --> 40:10.494
Any good ideas?

40:21.129 --> 40:24.174
We've got company. Three Asgard ships.

40:24.842 --> 40:28.512
Sir, I'm picking up a transmission
to the Goa'uld ship.

40:28.637 --> 40:31.181
This is Freyr of the Asgard.

40:31.306 --> 40:35.519
The vessels you face
are far superior to the one you attacked.

40:39.690 --> 40:42.067
Challenge us at your own peril.

40:49.533 --> 40:51.827
Mothership's retreating.

40:56.164 --> 40:58.333
It's over.

41:01.211 --> 41:03.255
That's it?

41:16.185 --> 41:19.313
Their examination of the android
must've yielded results -

41:19.438 --> 41:23.025
it looks like the Asgard have
the upper hand against the replicators.

41:23.150 --> 41:25.319
What about Thor?

41:25.444 --> 41:29.198
They managed to remove the device
from his brain, but it may be too late.

41:29.323 --> 41:32.075
Apparently he's lapsed into a coma.

41:32.743 --> 41:35.954
If they knew more about the device
they might be able to help him.

41:36.079 --> 41:38.624
They're studying it now towards that end.

41:38.749 --> 41:42.252
Unfortunately, it's unlike anything
they've ever encountered.

41:42.377 --> 41:46.882
Anubis clearly has access to technology
previously unknown to the Goa'uld.

41:47.216 --> 41:50.969
- It would explain his rapid rise to power.
- Yes, sir.

41:52.095 --> 41:54.139
All right. You're dismissed.

42:06.777 --> 42:09.154
We're not that much
of a nuisance just yet.

42:09.279 --> 42:11.573
Of that I am not so sure.

42:14.368 --> 42:17.246
Hey. Heading home?

42:17.371 --> 42:21.667
Actually, we were thinking of stopping off
for a bite to eat. Interested?

42:21.792 --> 42:23.961
- Sounds good.
- General?

42:24.086 --> 42:27.214
You three go ahead.
I've still got some work to do.

42:27.798 --> 42:30.008
(soft whistling wind)

42:31.677 --> 42:33.846
What was that?

42:35.472 --> 42:39.309
Perhaps a malfunction
in the ventilation system.

42:39.434 --> 42:41.687
Yeah, that's probably it.

42:43.105 --> 42:45.399
Bye, sir. Have a good night.
