00:05.059 --> 00:06.126
Ready, sweetheart?

00:06.128 --> 00:07.594
Almost.

00:07.596 --> 00:09.462
Okay.

00:10.431 --> 00:13.133
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

00:17.156 --> 00:19.990
Oh, dinner's sitting
a little heavy.

00:19.992 --> 00:22.159
Well, maybe I can help you
work it off.

00:22.161 --> 00:23.810
Yeah, about that--

00:24.110 --> 00:26.961
honey, would you mind terribly
if we just go to sleep?

00:26.983 --> 00:28.816
I'm so full and bloated
from that dinner,

00:28.818 --> 00:31.235
it'd be like sticking
a pin in a balloon.

00:32.237 --> 00:34.155
Can we not call it a pin?

00:34.157 --> 00:35.773
I'm sorry.

00:35.775 --> 00:37.376
I just don't think
I'd enjoy sex tonight.

00:37.377 --> 00:39.060
Since when is that
a requirement?

00:40.225 --> 00:41.357
But seriously, it's fine.

00:41.359 --> 00:42.925
It's no problem.

00:42.927 --> 00:44.427
Thank you.

00:44.429 --> 00:46.946
Ugh.

00:46.948 --> 00:50.316
Well, actually, it is a
little bit of problem.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.601
What's that?

00:51.603 --> 00:54.771
Well, uh, based
on past history--

00:54.773 --> 00:58.408
um, expensive dinner,
drinks, valet parking--

00:58.410 --> 01:00.160
um, I thought

01:00.162 --> 01:02.128
we would probably
be fooling around tonight.

01:02.130 --> 01:04.414
Uh, and-and-and with that
in mind,

01:04.416 --> 01:07.801
uh, about 20 minutes ago,
I popped a little blue pill

01:07.803 --> 01:10.720
to ensure that, uh,

01:10.722 --> 01:12.622
when you were ready, so was I.

01:12.624 --> 01:15.759
Of course, uh, now I'm ready
and you're not,

01:15.761 --> 01:19.512
a situation they didn't really
cover in those commercials.

01:20.397 --> 01:21.765
Oh, Alan.

01:21.767 --> 01:23.016
No, that's okay. It's okay.

01:23.018 --> 01:25.819
It's just kind of a shame
to waste them.

01:25.821 --> 01:28.471
I mean, they-they are
kind of pricey,

01:28.473 --> 01:31.574
even if they're expired ones
from Mexico.

01:31.576 --> 01:34.944
If I give you $20,
will you let me go to sleep?

01:36.313 --> 01:37.647
Oh, don't be silly.

01:37.649 --> 01:40.483
I don't want your money.

01:40.485 --> 01:42.585
But there are...

01:42.587 --> 01:44.987
other ways you
could reimburse me

01:44.989 --> 01:48.091
that wouldn't require a lot
of effort on your part.

01:55.633 --> 01:58.184
Should've taken the 20 bucks.

02:01.055 --> 02:02.722
Oh, hey.

02:02.724 --> 02:05.174
Oh, hey, Alan.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.481
Want some whiskey?

02:11.483 --> 02:13.116
I thought you
didn't like to drink.

02:13.118 --> 02:14.517
I don't.

02:14.519 --> 02:16.703
I'm trying to learn.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.075
I'm getting better.

02:22.077 --> 02:23.359
Is this about
your ex-wife?

02:23.361 --> 02:24.460
No.
Walden.

02:24.462 --> 02:25.528
Maybe.
Walden.

02:25.530 --> 02:26.830
Yes.

02:29.668 --> 02:30.867
All right, all right.

02:30.869 --> 02:32.001
Listen to me.

02:32.003 --> 02:34.754
Alcohol is just a bandage
for your problems.

02:34.756 --> 02:35.889
And I know this

02:35.891 --> 02:38.374
because I used to live
with the Mummy.

02:39.510 --> 02:40.727
Uh... come on.

02:40.729 --> 02:42.512
We, uh... we got to get
your mind off of her.

02:42.514 --> 02:44.314
Let's, uh...
let's watch some TV.

02:45.350 --> 02:47.267
Bridget and I
used to watch TV.

02:47.269 --> 02:49.385
That's the spirit.

02:49.387 --> 02:52.355
Okay, let's see
what's on.

02:52.357 --> 02:54.390
Oh.

02:54.392 --> 02:56.559
Cinnamon's Buns.

02:56.561 --> 03:00.563
"A medieval wench
falls for a bawdy baker.

03:00.565 --> 03:02.365
Adult. 1992."

03:02.367 --> 03:04.918
Ooh, a selection
from the classic era

03:04.920 --> 03:07.086
of soft-core cable porn.

03:07.088 --> 03:10.239
Or what I like to call
the winter bush years.

03:11.208 --> 03:13.910
I haven't watched much
porn since college.

03:13.912 --> 03:15.428
Yeah, me, neither.

03:15.430 --> 03:17.964
When I see it now, I just
feel bad for the girls.

03:17.966 --> 03:20.717
Yeah, yeah,
somebody's daughter. Shh.

03:20.719 --> 03:22.852
Are you ready to learn my craft?

03:22.854 --> 03:25.355
Of course, Master Baker.

03:25.357 --> 03:27.423
I am entirely in your hands.

03:27.425 --> 03:30.360
This is not
historically accurate.

03:30.362 --> 03:35.031
Medieval bakers did not
dress like Chef Boyardee.

03:35.033 --> 03:38.234
Don't need the DVD
commentary here.

03:38.236 --> 03:39.452
Sorry.

03:39.454 --> 03:40.904
Now, Cinnamon,

03:40.906 --> 03:43.156
take my frosting bag.

03:43.158 --> 03:44.407
It's so big.

03:44.409 --> 03:46.609
I can barely get
my hand around it.

03:46.611 --> 03:48.878
Use both hands, m'lady.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.414
It's well written.

03:51.416 --> 03:52.832
Like this?

03:52.834 --> 03:54.467
Now, squeeze,

03:54.469 --> 03:57.637
and anoint thy muffins
with my frosting.

03:59.189 --> 04:01.758
Boy, she looks
familiar.

04:01.760 --> 04:02.976
Yeah, she does.

04:02.978 --> 04:05.011
If I wasn't here,
would you be masturbating?

04:05.013 --> 04:08.681
You kidding? I'd be done
and fixing a sandwich.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.402
Master Baker,
whatever are you doing?

04:12.404 --> 04:15.772
I'm going to put my
loaf in your oven.

04:18.192 --> 04:20.192
That's clever.

04:20.195 --> 04:21.427
I don't know.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.863
She looks like a younger version
of your girlfriend.

04:23.865 --> 04:25.815
Lyndsey?
Uh-huh.

04:25.817 --> 04:27.700
Oh, nah.

04:27.702 --> 04:31.537
Oh, oh, you're so masterful!

04:31.539 --> 04:33.690
Kind of sounds like her, too.

04:34.591 --> 04:35.842
Maybe.

04:35.844 --> 04:37.593
Although I can't say
I've ever heard Lyndsey

04:37.595 --> 04:39.379
use that particular phrase.

04:39.381 --> 04:41.931
Don't stop! I can't get enough!

04:41.933 --> 04:43.833
Or that one.

04:43.835 --> 04:47.971
Maybe if I heard her say,
"Damn it, get off my hair."

04:49.940 --> 04:51.607
I don't know, Alan.

04:51.609 --> 04:53.559
I think that's
your girlfriend.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.311
No, no.

04:55.313 --> 04:57.730
Yes! Yes!

04:57.732 --> 04:59.165
No. No.

04:59.167 --> 05:01.401
Yes! Yes!

05:01.403 --> 05:03.886
Oh, God! Oh, God!

05:03.888 --> 05:06.155
Oh, God!

05:06.157 --> 05:09.592
Boy, she's not
very convincing.

05:09.594 --> 05:11.694
It is Lyndsey.

05:11.696 --> 05:13.496
Okay, I'm going to go
upstairs and masturbate.

05:13.498 --> 05:14.881
Wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:14.883 --> 05:16.382
You're... you're
going to go

05:16.384 --> 05:18.634
pleasure yourself while you're
thinking about my girlfriend?

05:18.636 --> 05:19.969
No, that'd be creepy.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.137
I'm going to go pleasure myself

05:21.139 --> 05:22.722
while I'm thinking
about my wife.

05:22.724 --> 05:25.041
Wait. Your... your wife?
Seriously?

05:25.043 --> 05:26.592
Yeah, what can I say?
I love Bridget,

05:26.594 --> 05:28.878
and I think she's the sexiest
woman in the whole world.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.064
Uh, you never fantasize
about anybody else?

05:31.066 --> 05:33.433
Mmm, sometimes I imagine
she's twins.

05:33.435 --> 05:35.384
Boo-ya!

05:39.389 --> 05:40.907
I never even thought of my wife

05:40.909 --> 05:43.392
when I was actually
having sex with my wife.

05:43.394 --> 05:46.896
Oh, Master Baker!

05:47.731 --> 05:51.434
Boy, she never let me
do that to her.

05:54.872 --> 05:57.256

I did offer this morning.

Can't expect me to turn on
like a light switch

07:06.295 --> 07:08.512
I was trying to walk and text.

07:08.514 --> 07:12.516
You were texting,
"Here comes Mr. Pokey."

Morning.

07:13.519 --> 07:14.518
Morning.
Morning.

07:14.520 --> 07:15.585
We'll talk later.

07:15.587 --> 07:16.920
About Mr. Pokey?

07:17.889 --> 07:19.189
I was speaking to Lyndsey.

07:19.191 --> 07:22.059
Sounds like a short
conversation.

07:23.394 --> 07:25.863

You're an attractive woman.

07:34.073 --> 07:36.156
You don't have to settle.

07:36.158 --> 07:39.159
I mean, bye!

07:40.044 --> 07:41.995
So, trouble in paradise?

07:41.997 --> 07:43.664
Why on Earth do you think

07:43.666 --> 07:45.332
I would share my problems
with you?

07:45.334 --> 07:46.583
Oh, come on.

07:46.585 --> 07:48.886
I may tease you now and then,
but that doesn't mean

07:48.888 --> 07:51.171
that I don't care about you
as a human being.

07:53.958 --> 07:56.143
All right.

07:56.145 --> 07:57.761
What do you do when you're in

07:57.763 --> 07:59.813
a relationship with someone
and, you know,

07:59.815 --> 08:00.898
like all
relationships, it...

08:00.900 --> 08:02.766
it has its ups
and downs, but...

08:02.768 --> 08:05.468
generally, things are
going pretty good

08:05.470 --> 08:06.904
until one day you discover

08:06.906 --> 08:10.307
that they are not at all
who you thought they were?

08:10.309 --> 08:12.826
And you don't know whether
to confront them about it or...

08:12.828 --> 08:14.328
or pretend you don't know,

08:14.330 --> 08:16.813
because the idea of being alone
is worse

08:16.815 --> 08:19.883
than being with someone
who's deceived you.

08:22.921 --> 08:24.504

08:24.506 --> 08:26.256
Hello?

08:54.186 --> 08:55.819

09:56.764 --> 09:57.965
I'm not a porn star.

09:57.967 --> 09:59.349
It was a little nudity.

09:59.351 --> 10:00.417
And simulated sex.

10:00.419 --> 10:01.601
Most of it.

10:03.721 --> 10:05.105

tell me about it?

10:45.763 --> 10:47.630
All right.

10:47.632 --> 10:51.401
Um... when I was a little boy,

10:51.403 --> 10:54.938
um, we had a dog
named Rusty,

10:54.940 --> 10:58.075

peanut butter,

10:58.077 --> 11:00.193
and, uh,

11:00.195 --> 11:02.946
my brother, uh,
convinced me

11:02.948 --> 11:05.648
that the best way
to feed him, uh,

11:05.650 --> 11:08.285
was to, uh, uh, smear it
on my testicles.

11:08.287 --> 11:10.454
Um...

11:10.456 --> 11:13.623

Well, I may love
Broadway musicals

Okay.

11:36.815 --> 11:38.448
Let's recap the highlights.

11:38.450 --> 11:41.968
You embezzled money
from your family,

11:41.970 --> 11:43.686
you cheated on me
with an old girlfriend,

11:43.688 --> 11:45.355
- Mm-hmm.
- you might be the father

11:45.357 --> 11:47.190
of Judith and
Herb's baby,

11:47.192 --> 11:49.159
you didn't tell
your late brother that the woman

11:49.161 --> 11:50.994
he was chasing
was married to a mannequin

11:50.996 --> 11:53.330
because she gave you $50,000
to keep it a secret.

11:53.332 --> 11:55.865
And to top
it all off,

11:55.867 --> 11:58.969
you gave the family dog
type 2 diabetes.

11:59.804 --> 12:02.139
Oh, wait, one more thing.

12:02.141 --> 12:04.707
Those diamond earrings I got you
for your birthday last year...

12:04.709 --> 12:06.593
Let me guess.
They're not real.

12:06.595 --> 12:07.877
Oh, no, they're real.

12:07.879 --> 12:10.897
Uh, it's just, I kind of
stole them from my ex-wife.

12:13.067 --> 12:17.437
