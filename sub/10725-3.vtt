00:01.889 --> 00:03.656
Over 68 million Americans

00:03.722 --> 00:06.524
leave the safety of our
borders every year.

00:06.558 --> 00:08.025
If danger strikes,

00:08.060 --> 00:10.261
the FBI's international response team

00:10.295 --> 00:12.563
is called into action.

00:36.321 --> 00:39.090
Gavin, come on. These ladies
are waiting on their photo.

00:39.124 --> 00:40.424
Okay, here we go.

00:40.459 --> 00:41.392
Ready?

00:41.426 --> 00:42.593
Smile.

00:44.930 --> 00:46.531
Hey. Thank you so much
for coming, you guys.

00:46.565 --> 00:47.598
- Bye.
- Come again, okay?

00:52.004 --> 00:53.371
Bye, Hank!

00:53.405 --> 00:54.305
Thank you!

00:54.339 --> 00:56.207
Bye.

00:56.241 --> 00:57.208
All right, ladies.

00:57.242 --> 00:59.110
Time to call it a night.

01:02.014 --> 01:02.747
Come on.

01:24.203 --> 01:25.469
Yo, what's up, Hank?

01:25.504 --> 01:27.104
I need a beer.

01:27.139 --> 01:28.973
I think I can help you with that.

01:29.007 --> 01:31.275
But first, you up for
hitting Omar's tonight?

01:31.310 --> 01:34.011
Yeah. I just need to go home
and take a quick shower.

01:34.046 --> 01:36.180
Yeah, you do.

01:36.215 --> 01:38.282
If I wasn't so tired, I'd
punch you right now.

01:39.818 --> 01:41.352
Go grab a cold one from the trunk

01:41.386 --> 01:42.486
and stop complaining.

02:00.672 --> 02:03.975
I said go grab a beer, not
brew it from scratch!

02:14.052 --> 02:16.187
What the hell?

02:22.861 --> 02:24.528
I can't breathe!

02:27.232 --> 02:28.833
It burns!

02:57.362 --> 03:00.064
What special honor
brings you to my office?

03:00.098 --> 03:02.199
Where's my octopus coffee mug?

03:02.234 --> 03:03.234
Excuse me?

03:03.268 --> 03:03.868
Unh-unh. Don't.

03:03.902 --> 03:05.836
Beth from carpool told me

03:05.871 --> 03:06.971
she saw you take it from the kitchen.

03:07.005 --> 03:09.206
Have you asked yourself why
you're listening to someone

03:09.241 --> 03:11.175
whose glasses are thicker
than old coke bottles?

03:11.209 --> 03:12.944
Beth's stigmatism has no
bearing on her veracity.

03:12.978 --> 03:14.211
I think Beth is just a little bitter

03:14.246 --> 03:15.613
that someone didn't
give her a call back

03:15.647 --> 03:16.614
after the first date.

03:16.648 --> 03:17.648
What...

03:17.683 --> 03:20.251
She had an indefensible
position on Moore's law.

03:20.285 --> 03:23.454
Semiconductor density
is a super-sexy topic.

03:23.488 --> 03:26.023
With transistors approaching
single-atom width,

03:26.058 --> 03:27.892
Moore's law is only relevant for...

03:27.926 --> 03:30.628
She thought it was
invented by Roger Moore.

03:30.662 --> 03:32.563
And enforced by the 007.

03:32.597 --> 03:34.198
Ouch.

03:34.232 --> 03:36.300
That does not preclude
her having seen you

03:36.335 --> 03:38.102
take my octopus cup of drinking.

03:38.136 --> 03:40.104
Except the fact that I
don't drink coffee.

03:40.138 --> 03:42.239
Oh. Good point.

03:42.274 --> 03:43.107
Hug it out?

03:43.141 --> 03:45.042
Not necessary.

03:45.077 --> 03:46.110
Okay.

03:46.144 --> 03:46.911
Mm.

03:46.945 --> 03:48.713
LAN party... Wednesday, my crib.

03:48.747 --> 03:50.147
Of course. I'll bring the bean dip.

03:50.182 --> 03:52.116
B.Y.O.C.!

03:56.488 --> 03:58.689
I don't drink coffee.

04:00.158 --> 04:04.428
But I do enjoy a nice cup of tea.

04:12.838 --> 04:16.240
Jack, we need you and the rest
of the I.R.T. back at base asap.

04:18.310 --> 04:21.411
Where we off to this time, boss?

04:21.446 --> 04:23.147
Cairo, Egypt.

04:23.181 --> 04:24.749
Mm. The land of pharaohs.

04:24.783 --> 04:28.586
More recently, like the land of
social unrest and instability.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.688
Let's catch everyone up, Monty.

04:30.722 --> 04:32.323
As-salaam-alaikum, agents.

04:32.357 --> 04:34.592
Okay, Malik Said, 25,

04:34.626 --> 04:36.293
a first-generation Egyptian American,

04:36.328 --> 04:38.295
was found dead this morning

04:38.330 --> 04:39.196
on the outskirts of Cairo

04:39.231 --> 04:41.999
when an unsub threw this into his car.

04:42.034 --> 04:44.135
Wow.

04:44.169 --> 04:45.603
Chemical attacks... Brutal.

04:45.637 --> 04:47.271
Burns everything inside and out.

04:47.305 --> 04:49.774
Also causes trouble
breathing, coughing up blood,

04:49.808 --> 04:51.776
and tissue necrosis
before it kills you.

04:51.810 --> 04:53.677
Killing with gas as a murder weapon

04:53.712 --> 04:56.347
is not only uncommon, it's
also highly unpredictable.

04:56.381 --> 04:58.215
The gas could be an indication

04:58.250 --> 05:00.384
that our unsub wants his
victims to suffer...

05:00.419 --> 05:02.486
Getting off on the visceral brutality

05:02.521 --> 05:03.988
of watching them boil alive.

05:04.022 --> 05:05.056
A true sadist.

05:05.090 --> 05:06.290
So why Malik?

05:06.324 --> 05:08.225
Malik Said was R.O.T.C. in college,

05:08.260 --> 05:10.227
served in the army for two years

05:10.262 --> 05:12.863
till he tore up his knee and
got an honorable discharge.

05:12.898 --> 05:15.199
He moved to Egypt to start a business.

05:15.233 --> 05:17.368
So an ex-military
American killed in Egypt

05:17.402 --> 05:19.336
by a chemical attack?

05:19.371 --> 05:20.271
Could be terrorism.

05:20.305 --> 05:22.540
Just last year, a wave
of terror attacks

05:22.574 --> 05:25.209
swept over Egypt's
northern Sinai peninsula.

05:25.243 --> 05:27.978
They used chemical gases and
left many civilians dead.

05:28.013 --> 05:29.380
Yeah, those attacks were carried out

05:29.414 --> 05:30.514
by a known islamic state affiliate

05:30.549 --> 05:32.516
called the province of Sinai,

05:32.551 --> 05:35.553
a known splinter group of
the Muslim brotherhood.

05:35.587 --> 05:38.089
So, what was Malik doing out
there at that time of night?

05:38.123 --> 05:41.358
We think he was there to
meet Henry "Hank" Willis,

05:41.393 --> 05:43.394
a 25-year-old American graduate student

05:43.428 --> 05:45.096
from Williamsport, Pennsylvania,

05:45.130 --> 05:47.364
who, like nearly 600 other U.S.
citizens

05:47.399 --> 05:49.333
is currently studying in Egypt.

05:49.367 --> 05:51.202
Hank was an employee at the camel shop

05:51.236 --> 05:53.771
and clocked out just minutes
before Malik was killed.

05:53.805 --> 05:55.239
Where is Hank now?

05:55.273 --> 05:57.074
In the wind... Local P.D.
has had no luck

05:57.109 --> 05:58.776
in trying to find him for questioning,

05:58.810 --> 06:01.412
but they did find his phone in
the car, along with Malik's.

06:01.446 --> 06:02.913
They're sending over the data now.

06:02.948 --> 06:04.515
What's Malik and Hank's connection?

06:04.549 --> 06:05.883
Uh, undetermined.

06:05.917 --> 06:07.384
They didn't go to work
or school together,

06:07.419 --> 06:09.286
and they didn't share any
social media friends.

06:09.321 --> 06:11.188
Hank's phone at the time
he clocked out at work

06:11.223 --> 06:12.523
puts him at the scene of the crime.

06:12.557 --> 06:14.358
Yeah, but if you're
gonna kill somebody,

06:14.392 --> 06:15.626
you don't leave your phone behind.

06:15.660 --> 06:17.061
Unless you panic.

06:17.095 --> 06:18.229
Hank is a suspect,

06:18.263 --> 06:21.599
and we need to find him before
the Egyptian police do.

06:21.633 --> 06:24.301
They'll shoot first and
ask questions later.

06:24.336 --> 06:26.203
Well, Hank could have
run anywhere by now.

06:26.238 --> 06:28.839
Or moved on to his next victim.

06:51.096 --> 06:52.263
Help me!

06:52.297 --> 06:53.464
Help me!

06:53.498 --> 06:55.299
Help me!

06:55.333 --> 06:56.567
Help me!

06:56.601 --> 06:57.902
Help me!

06:58.700 --> 07:02.967

07:25.211 --> 07:27.245
Egyptian proverb.

07:28.648 --> 07:31.349
Once we de-plane, the deputy
minister will confirm

07:31.384 --> 07:33.785
our modus operandi while in Cairo.

07:33.819 --> 07:34.953
Hey, Jack.

07:34.987 --> 07:37.389
Seems the deputy minster's
already decided to come aboard.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.661
What's he doing?

07:42.695 --> 07:44.930
He's telling us it may be our plane,

07:44.964 --> 07:46.731
but it's his country.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.604
Welcome to Cairo, agents.

07:54.473 --> 07:55.974
Unit chief Jack Garrett.

07:56.008 --> 08:00.445
SSA's Clara Seger, Matt
Simmons, and Mae Jarvis.

08:00.479 --> 08:02.180
I'm deputy minister Akram Sarkis.

08:02.214 --> 08:03.448
'Ahlaan.

08:05.751 --> 08:08.053
Deputy minister, we put in a request

08:08.087 --> 08:09.154
for weapons clearance.

08:09.188 --> 08:12.290
I'm afraid it's been denied,
due to political recourse.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.192
The fact that an American student,

08:14.226 --> 08:16.695
also a former soldier, Has
been murdered in Egypt

08:16.729 --> 08:19.130
is already drawing
international attention.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.333
Any perception that Egypt's government

08:21.367 --> 08:23.368
is being influenced by outside sources,

08:23.402 --> 08:24.703
particularly American,

08:24.737 --> 08:26.871
and tensions in the
region could boil over.

08:26.906 --> 08:28.473
Of course. I understand.

08:28.507 --> 08:31.242
In return, I'd like to
get some armed escorts.

08:31.277 --> 08:32.409
That shouldn't be too hard.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.511
Any luck tracking down Hank Willis?

08:34.547 --> 08:35.647
Negative.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.316
He kept a low profile... Very
few friends or co-workers.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.385
Anything else that can
help us moving forward?

08:40.419 --> 08:43.355
It seems that Malik Said

08:43.389 --> 08:46.591
was not the first person to
die by this M.O. In Cairo.

08:46.626 --> 08:49.394
A local resident, Jabir Ghannam,

08:49.428 --> 08:51.763
was gassed in his
bedroom a few days ago.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.665
Why are we just learning
about this now?

08:53.699 --> 08:55.700
We believed the man's
death to be a suicide

08:55.735 --> 08:57.369
and didn't make the connection

08:57.403 --> 08:59.938
until we started to
investigate Malik's death.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.773
It's a strange way to kill oneself.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.441
What makes you think it's suicide?

09:03.476 --> 09:04.509
The victim was alone,

09:04.543 --> 09:06.878
and there was no forced
entry into the apartment.

09:06.912 --> 09:07.679
Who found him?

09:07.713 --> 09:09.381
His wife.

09:09.415 --> 09:11.449
She was at her parents'
house with their daughter,

09:11.484 --> 09:13.518
and when she returned to the apartment,

09:13.552 --> 09:15.954
she made the discovery.

09:15.988 --> 09:18.390
We looked into her alibi.
It checked out.

09:18.424 --> 09:20.291
We'd still like to
have a chat with her.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.093
Of course.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.562
Clara and Mae, you check
in with Jabir's widow,

09:24.597 --> 09:25.764
see what she has to say.

09:25.798 --> 09:28.299
Simmons and I will take a
drive out to the crime scene.

09:28.334 --> 09:29.634
Then we'll regroup back here.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.036
You are more than welcome

09:31.070 --> 09:33.138
to use any of our
facilities if need be.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.439
Well, thank you, Deputy,

09:34.473 --> 09:36.274
but our resources are on the plane,

09:36.308 --> 09:39.077
and seeing as the airport is
central to the rest of Cairo,

09:39.111 --> 09:42.647
it makes sense to use
this as base camp.

09:44.450 --> 09:45.817
Excuse me.

09:45.851 --> 09:46.918
Agents.

09:46.952 --> 09:48.620
- Yeah?
- Please.

09:48.654 --> 09:50.555
Give me something good, Monty.

09:50.589 --> 09:53.491
Hank and Malik's phones both had
red phone applications on them.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.359
Red phone?

09:54.393 --> 09:56.127
Point-to-point telephonic encryption

09:56.162 --> 09:57.095
designed to protect callers

09:57.129 --> 09:59.297
from having their
communications intercepted.

09:59.331 --> 10:01.633
The messages erase themselves
both off the screen

10:01.667 --> 10:03.968
and the server 90 seconds
after being opened.

10:04.003 --> 10:07.639
They wanted a secure line of
communication between them.

10:07.673 --> 10:10.175
So what were they trying to hide?

10:10.209 --> 10:11.943
Think these guys are C.I.A.

10:11.977 --> 10:13.111
Should we give the company a call?

10:13.145 --> 10:16.848
If we want to wait six months
for a definitive answer.

10:16.882 --> 10:17.816
But, Monty, why...

10:17.850 --> 10:19.451
Don't I bring the family
in for an interview

10:19.485 --> 10:20.452
and see what they know?

10:20.486 --> 10:21.286
Yes.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.954
But if they were intelligence,

10:22.988 --> 10:25.657
they would have never told
their families the truth.

10:25.691 --> 10:27.525
Let me see what I can fish out of them.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.828
Just remember... they'll
have mundane cover stories,

10:29.862 --> 10:32.197
and the details won't add up.

10:38.037 --> 10:40.705
We're so sorry for your loss.

10:40.740 --> 10:44.542
I told the police that Jabir
wouldn't kill himself.

10:44.577 --> 10:45.944
He loved his family too much.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.980
But... They would not listen.

10:49.014 --> 10:51.349
We understand.

10:51.383 --> 10:52.383
Do you?

10:52.418 --> 10:53.818
Are you two mothers?

10:53.853 --> 10:56.154
Do you know how it feels
to be alone in the world

10:56.188 --> 10:58.590
and wonder how you
will feed your child?

10:59.725 --> 11:00.825
I don't.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.361
But I do want to find out who
did this to your husband

11:03.395 --> 11:04.529
and bring them to justice.

11:04.563 --> 11:05.563
Yeah, I would like to believe you,

11:05.598 --> 11:08.500
but nobody cares for the
poor in this country.

11:08.534 --> 11:10.668
We can help you.

11:10.703 --> 11:13.705
Did you or your husband
know either of these men?

11:14.774 --> 11:17.342
Did he have any
arguments, disagreements,

11:17.376 --> 11:19.711
grievances with anyone of recent?

11:19.745 --> 11:21.646
Have you walked down
the streets of Cairo?

11:21.680 --> 11:23.214
That's every day here.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.517
Did you husband have
any outstanding debts

11:25.551 --> 11:27.552
or business dealings gone wrong?

11:27.586 --> 11:28.686
No.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.022
Jabir was sick for so long.

11:31.056 --> 11:33.558
I pray now he has found peace.

11:33.592 --> 11:34.325
Sick how?

11:34.360 --> 11:35.326
He had headaches, coughed a lot.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.729
How am I supposed to know?
I'm not a doctor.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.230
What did he do for a living?

11:39.265 --> 11:41.166
There are few jobs in Cairo.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.668
Like most men, he went down to
the barricades every morning.

11:43.702 --> 11:44.702
The barricades?

11:44.737 --> 11:47.205
It's a wall in Cairo where
men go to find work,

11:47.239 --> 11:48.273
if you're picked.

11:48.307 --> 11:52.577
Mostly manual labor, but
every little bit helps.

11:52.611 --> 11:56.714
The day of his death, where
were you and your child?

11:56.749 --> 11:59.083
I-I told the police this already.

11:59.118 --> 12:00.685
I was at my mother's house.

12:00.719 --> 12:03.188
She's sick. I take care of her.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.791
Jabir was supposed to
meet us, but he slept in.

12:06.826 --> 12:09.360
Is that your daughter?

12:09.395 --> 12:10.895
Yes.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.764
That's Bishara.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.933
Jabir took it.

12:14.967 --> 12:16.801
Is that jabir?

12:16.836 --> 12:17.402
Yes.

12:17.436 --> 12:20.038
He had a beautiful eye.

12:23.008 --> 12:26.444
Your daughter... Where is she now?

12:26.478 --> 12:28.546
With her teta.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.315
Please.

12:30.349 --> 12:33.318
Find the men who did this to my husband

12:33.352 --> 12:34.719
and make them pay.

12:43.128 --> 12:46.331
We have preserved everything, as
you requested, Agent Garrett.

12:46.365 --> 12:47.699
Thank you, Minister.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.669
I'd say we can rule out terrorism.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.137
And how do you figure that?

12:53.172 --> 12:56.107
It's hard to spread fear
from an isolated location.

12:56.141 --> 12:59.143
No witnesses, no media
coverage, no point.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.079
Terrorists like attention.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.914
This place doesn't give them that.

13:04.016 --> 13:04.983
But I can see

13:05.017 --> 13:07.652
why the unsub drew Malik
out here alone at night.

13:07.686 --> 13:10.955
It's the perfect place
to strike undetected.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.590
Yeah, the desert acts

13:12.625 --> 13:14.259
as a natural forensic
countermeasure, too.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.829
The sun, the sand, critters...
They remove trace evidence.

13:17.863 --> 13:19.697
High winds cover up the rest.

13:19.732 --> 13:23.835
If the unsub left anything
behind, it's blown away.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.436
So, let's walk through this.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.272
- Malik drives up.
- Hank gets in.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.775
We know this because his phone
was found on the passenger side.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.744
Why does he then get out again?

13:38.217 --> 13:39.651
Malik pops the trunk.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.824
Oh.

13:46.859 --> 13:47.992
Someone was thirsty.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.201
What do you got, Jack?

13:59.905 --> 14:02.707
Sand covers, but it rarely sticks.

14:02.741 --> 14:04.509
From the look of this blood splatter,

14:04.543 --> 14:07.712
someone was struck here, then
they fell to the ground.

14:07.746 --> 14:10.882
This was a blitz attack
to incapacitate Hank.

14:10.916 --> 14:13.551
He's not our unsub. He's a victim.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.724
Mrs. Said, I am sorry for your loss

14:19.758 --> 14:22.260
and appreciate you
coming in at this time.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.829
If it helps catch the monster
who did this to my son,

14:24.863 --> 14:25.897
then so be it.

14:25.931 --> 14:28.833
Now, can you tell me what
Malik was doing in Egypt?

14:28.867 --> 14:31.736
Malik had been visiting
Cairo since he was young.

14:31.770 --> 14:33.838
He had a special
connection to the land.

14:33.872 --> 14:35.540
- That you left.
- Yes.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.208
It's ironic.

14:37.242 --> 14:39.911
You fight and claw to
get out of someplace

14:39.945 --> 14:41.679
to give your children a better life,

14:41.714 --> 14:43.614
and then they grow up and go right back

14:43.649 --> 14:45.083
to the place you ran from.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.419
What was Malik's business in Cairo?

14:48.454 --> 14:50.455
He had an export-import business.

14:50.489 --> 14:51.923
What kind of export-import?

14:51.957 --> 14:53.691
Egyptian spices.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.895
I'm Brenda Willis, Hank's mom.

14:57.930 --> 14:58.930
Of course.

14:58.964 --> 15:00.031
I'm Russ Montgomery,

15:00.065 --> 15:01.799
one of the agents working on
your son's investigation.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.368
Any updates on Hank?

15:03.402 --> 15:04.402
Not yet.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.637
But if I could please ask
you to give us a mo...

15:06.672 --> 15:08.606
I am so sorry that we are meeting

15:08.640 --> 15:09.907
under these circumstances.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.443
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

15:12.478 --> 15:15.913
My thoughts and prayers are
with you and your son Malik.

15:15.948 --> 15:17.949
Thank you for your kind words.

15:17.983 --> 15:20.585
I hope that your boy is found soon.

15:20.619 --> 15:21.919
Thank you.

15:21.954 --> 15:25.223
Since you're both here...

15:25.257 --> 15:27.592
One of the things that
we're trying to figure out

15:27.626 --> 15:29.494
is how Hank and Malik knew one another.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.496
Oh... I have no idea.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.931
I'm very close with Malik. I
speak to him all the time.

15:33.966 --> 15:37.201
But he has never mentioned
her son... Hank?

15:38.137 --> 15:40.304
Mrs. Willis, were you
going to say something?

15:40.339 --> 15:41.572
What?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.174
No, I...

15:43.208 --> 15:44.842
It's been a long couple of days.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.978
I'm... I'm sorry.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.146
Of course.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.614
No worries.

15:51.350 --> 15:54.185
Mrs. Said, I can reach you
wherever it is you're staying

15:54.219 --> 15:55.721
and give you updates as I receive them.

15:55.744 --> 15:58.813
I cannot go until my
son's body returns home.

15:58.847 --> 16:00.081
Then I will take him

16:00.115 --> 16:02.049
and have him buried next to his father.

16:03.151 --> 16:04.185
Now, Mrs. Willis,

16:04.219 --> 16:06.654
if you'll come with me,
I'll be able to fill you in

16:06.688 --> 16:08.589
on the details of your
son's disappearance.

16:08.623 --> 16:10.091
Okay.

16:17.099 --> 16:20.234
All right. Mrs. Willis,
what aren't you telling me?

16:20.268 --> 16:22.269
I was just trying to protect her.

16:22.304 --> 16:25.439
Malik's mother doesn't know
who her son really was.

16:25.474 --> 16:26.807
But you do?

16:27.876 --> 16:28.943
Yes.

16:28.977 --> 16:30.511
Look, I understand that there are

16:30.545 --> 16:32.179
certain people's professional lives

16:32.214 --> 16:33.948
that require them to live a lie.

16:33.982 --> 16:37.251
And for some, that's true in
their personal lives, too.

16:40.389 --> 16:41.989
Mrs. Willis.

16:42.023 --> 16:46.160
My son might be missing,
but her boy is dead.

16:46.194 --> 16:49.230
The last thing that woman
needs is to be alone.

17:01.243 --> 17:02.843
Hey. How'd it go?

17:02.878 --> 17:04.979
Hank's not responsible
for Malik's death.

17:05.012 --> 17:06.113
He was abducted.

17:07.249 --> 17:08.782
Any luck with Jabir's widow?

17:08.817 --> 17:09.784
Yeah, I mean, she's angry,

17:09.818 --> 17:11.986
but she's also grieving
the loss of her husband.

17:12.020 --> 17:13.387
Yeah, she said that Jabir was sick,

17:13.422 --> 17:15.289
but she wouldn't tell us how.

17:15.323 --> 17:16.957
How could we expect her
to tell us the truth

17:16.992 --> 17:18.726
with the Egyptian military
standing right there?

17:18.760 --> 17:20.361
Oh, speaking of,

17:20.395 --> 17:22.396
Monty was able to get us
Jabir's medical records,

17:22.431 --> 17:24.698
and there have been
several pages redacted,

17:24.733 --> 17:28.202
so there are things that
they don't want us to know.

17:28.236 --> 17:30.304
They might become a problem, Jack.

17:30.338 --> 17:32.740
That's why I suggested we
use the plane as a base.

17:32.774 --> 17:34.809
Ever since the military coup, I'm sure

17:34.843 --> 17:37.411
everything the Egyptians
are offering is bugged.

17:37.446 --> 17:40.381
Well, not to mention we
share very different views

17:40.415 --> 17:42.316
about what democracy means.

17:42.350 --> 17:44.318
We have had better luck
looking into the gas

17:44.352 --> 17:46.387
that was used on Malik.

17:46.421 --> 17:48.389
It is a lachrymatory agent.

17:48.423 --> 17:50.658
It's similar to phenacyl chloride,

17:50.692 --> 17:52.560
which is a popular riot-control gas.

17:52.594 --> 17:54.695
It's banned by
international convention,

17:54.729 --> 17:56.897
but it is used by the
Egyptian government.

17:56.932 --> 17:59.033
The gas, when dispensed
in large crowds,

17:59.067 --> 18:01.435
weakens as it spreads,
causing only nausea,

18:01.470 --> 18:02.269
but in a contained space,

18:02.304 --> 18:04.371
it'll kill you within two minutes.

18:04.406 --> 18:06.240
So where did the unsub get his hands on

18:06.274 --> 18:07.575
a government-controlled gas?

18:07.609 --> 18:09.243
Or did the unsub work
for the government?

18:10.712 --> 18:12.046
Hey, guys, I think I know

18:12.080 --> 18:13.914
what Hank and Malik were really hiding.

18:13.949 --> 18:15.316
They were in a relationship.

18:16.451 --> 18:18.118
Homosexuality is against the law

18:18.153 --> 18:19.620
in almost all of the Middle East.

18:19.654 --> 18:22.189
Punishable by arrest,
whippings, even death.

18:22.224 --> 18:25.392
Well, under the Al-sisi regime,
homosexuality is legal in Egypt,

18:25.427 --> 18:27.628
but men suspected of being
gay are subject to arrest

18:27.662 --> 18:29.296
on charges of debauchery,

18:29.331 --> 18:32.299
and over 250 men have been
arrested on related charges

18:32.334 --> 18:33.400
in this last year alone.

18:33.435 --> 18:35.436
Well, it's only legal in name.

18:35.470 --> 18:37.605
Their basic freedoms
are still in danger.

18:37.639 --> 18:40.140
Which is explains why Malik and
Hank were using red phones

18:40.175 --> 18:41.442
to send messages to one another.

18:41.476 --> 18:43.777
And why they never had
any pictures together.

18:44.779 --> 18:46.480
This isn't a murder.

18:46.515 --> 18:47.781
It's a hate crime.

19:07.369 --> 19:08.969
Where's Malik?

19:13.542 --> 19:14.775
Oh, no.

19:14.809 --> 19:15.943
Get that thing away from me.

19:15.977 --> 19:18.312
You brought this onto yourself...

19:18.346 --> 19:19.914
You and all your friends.

19:19.948 --> 19:21.448
No, no, no.

19:21.483 --> 19:22.616
Please.

19:23.718 --> 19:25.819
Oh, no, no, no, no.

19:26.888 --> 19:28.022
No! Aah!

19:31.299 --> 19:32.666
If Hank is alive,

19:32.700 --> 19:34.868
we're running out of time
to find and save him.

19:34.902 --> 19:39.706
So if this is a hate crime,
who's committing it?

19:39.740 --> 19:41.708
Well, take your pick. We've
got a lot of options.

19:41.742 --> 19:43.910
The Arab Spring puts the
Muslim brotherhood in power,

19:43.945 --> 19:45.879
then two years later, they're
totally taken out of it.

19:45.913 --> 19:48.048
Could be a fractured group
that's still active.

19:48.082 --> 19:49.082
Or the current regime.

19:49.116 --> 19:50.383
They legalized homosexuality

19:50.418 --> 19:51.918
as a way to make nice to the west,

19:51.953 --> 19:54.521
but behind closed doors, they've
got a different agenda.

19:54.555 --> 19:56.089
Like appeasing fundamentalists.

19:56.123 --> 19:57.891
What about the first victim... Jabir?

19:57.925 --> 19:58.692
Does this mean he was gay?

19:58.726 --> 20:00.760
We could interview the wife again.

20:00.795 --> 20:02.562
Hey, guys, on Malik's phone,

20:02.596 --> 20:04.931
I found some text messages.

20:04.966 --> 20:07.100
I thought the red phone
application erased all messages.

20:07.134 --> 20:09.069
The messages do, but the senders don't.

20:09.103 --> 20:10.603
The thing about the 256-bit cipher

20:10.638 --> 20:11.871
is that it's designed to protect

20:11.906 --> 20:14.174
against brute-force attacks
on consumer-grade hardware.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.775
It's not really intended to protect

20:15.810 --> 20:16.843
against the unmitigated power

20:16.877 --> 20:18.778
of the national geospatial
intelligence agency.

20:18.813 --> 20:20.213
Yeah, let's try that again in English.

20:20.247 --> 20:21.348
Okay.

20:21.382 --> 20:25.051
There's a hidden list of contacts...
10, to be exact.

20:25.086 --> 20:27.387
Now, the encryption is weak,
so our computers can crack it,

20:27.421 --> 20:29.389
but the messages are gonna
be a little harder.

20:29.423 --> 20:31.725
Tracking names down the
good, old-fashioned way

20:31.759 --> 20:32.759
won't speed this up.

20:32.793 --> 20:34.694
If I could just focus on one name,

20:34.729 --> 20:36.429
I could put all my efforts into that.

20:36.464 --> 20:38.565
And I can probably get
you their messages.

20:38.600 --> 20:42.036
You said Malik's mother was
unaware of her son's lifestyle.

20:42.069 --> 20:45.905
Then maybe this is as simple
as a process of elimination.

20:56.650 --> 21:00.120
That rush you feel is
the viper's poison

21:00.154 --> 21:02.088
working its way through your system.

21:04.625 --> 21:05.959
What do you want?

21:05.993 --> 21:08.061
Answers to my questions.

21:08.095 --> 21:10.463
Why would I tell you anything?

21:10.498 --> 21:13.833
Because if you do...

21:13.868 --> 21:15.602
I will give you the antidote.

21:21.142 --> 21:24.911
Sabah was his cousin,
Wahlaan, his landlord,

21:24.945 --> 21:26.613
and Galila was his fiancée.

21:30.051 --> 21:31.184
You sure of this?

21:31.218 --> 21:31.918
Yes.

21:31.952 --> 21:32.986
They took a break recently,

21:33.020 --> 21:36.523
but Malik told us they would
get back together soon.

21:36.557 --> 21:37.657
Who is Omar?

21:37.691 --> 21:39.592
I've never heard of Omar.

21:39.627 --> 21:40.994
Or Mahdoor.

21:41.028 --> 21:43.930
They played soccer with Mahdoor.

21:43.964 --> 21:44.898
"They" who?

21:48.002 --> 21:50.003
I think what's important
here is to focus on

21:50.037 --> 21:52.172
finding Brenda's son and
whoever did this to Malik.

21:52.206 --> 21:53.873
Brenda.

21:53.908 --> 21:55.842
You know my Malik?

21:57.044 --> 21:59.012
Then why didn't you say so earlier?

21:59.046 --> 22:00.780
Because you've been through a lot,

22:00.815 --> 22:02.715
and I didn't want to upset you.

22:02.750 --> 22:03.817
About what?

22:03.851 --> 22:06.619
About Malik... and Hank.

22:06.654 --> 22:07.921
They were friends?

22:10.157 --> 22:11.091
They were in love.

22:24.839 --> 22:28.007
Shame on you... To
speak ill of the dead.

22:33.514 --> 22:35.215
You were right, Jack.

22:35.249 --> 22:37.517
Omar was the only name
his mother did not know.

22:37.551 --> 22:40.153
It seems Omar has a moving party

22:40.187 --> 22:41.988
for LGBT members in Cairo.

22:42.022 --> 22:43.256
You text him, and he texts you back

22:43.290 --> 22:44.724
wherever the venue is that night.

22:44.758 --> 22:47.494
Smart way to keep one step
ahead of the local P.D.

22:47.528 --> 22:49.929
It's Malik and Hank's M.O.

22:49.964 --> 22:52.065
All right, I'm sending you
Omar's work address now

22:52.099 --> 22:53.399
and a photo to identify him.

22:53.434 --> 22:54.200
Good work, Monty.

22:54.235 --> 22:55.902
Oh, one more thing.

22:55.936 --> 22:59.939
One of the names on the list is
supposedly Malik's ex-fiancée.

22:59.974 --> 23:01.407
You got a name and
address for her, too?

23:01.442 --> 23:02.575
On its way.

23:02.610 --> 23:04.878
Jack, why don't Mae and I go
ask the deputy for assistance

23:04.912 --> 23:06.613
interviewing Malik's ex-fiancée,

23:06.647 --> 23:08.114
and then you and Simmons
can go talk to Omar

23:08.149 --> 23:09.415
without a babysitter?

23:09.450 --> 23:10.717
Sounds like a plan.

23:15.890 --> 23:19.125
Khan el-Khalili market is
the original burial site

23:19.160 --> 23:22.362
for the Fatimid dynasty,
who founded Cairo.

23:22.396 --> 23:23.530
Wow.

23:23.564 --> 23:24.430
"Wow"... yeah.

23:24.466 --> 23:26.967
That's exactly what the
ancient romans said

23:27.001 --> 23:29.068
when they saw it around 100 A.D.

23:35.309 --> 23:36.576
That's him.

23:44.485 --> 23:47.253
If you're looking for copper,
you're at the right place.

23:47.288 --> 23:49.255
My prices are very fair.

23:49.290 --> 23:51.291
I'm looking for some information.

23:55.129 --> 23:57.564
I enjoy America... The
Kardashians and such...

23:57.598 --> 23:59.766
But you will ask questions and go

23:59.800 --> 24:02.068
while I must stay and deal with police.

24:02.102 --> 24:03.136
All right, well, you have our word...

24:03.171 --> 24:05.239
Anything that's said
between us will stay here.

24:05.272 --> 24:07.340
Ah. This is where I say
"why should I trust you?"

24:07.374 --> 24:09.976
And then you will tell me
because I have no choice.

24:10.010 --> 24:10.843
Yeah, something like that.

24:13.380 --> 24:15.615
Hurry, then... Before
the police see us.

24:17.952 --> 24:19.352
You know these guys?

24:19.386 --> 24:21.521
No. Why should I?

24:21.555 --> 24:23.423
We know who you are and
what you do, Omar,

24:23.457 --> 24:25.291
and the sooner you give us the truth,

24:25.326 --> 24:27.393
the sooner we go away.

24:32.399 --> 24:34.801
Yes, that is Hank and Malik.

24:34.835 --> 24:37.203
What about this guy?

24:37.238 --> 24:38.438
No.

24:38.472 --> 24:39.472
You sure about that?

24:39.506 --> 24:42.041
Look, our community is
very small, very trustful.

24:42.076 --> 24:43.810
That man is not a part of it.

24:43.844 --> 24:45.311
What is this all about?

24:45.346 --> 24:47.947
We think someone's targeting
gay men in Cairo.

24:47.982 --> 24:49.249
Oh, that's nothing new.

24:51.252 --> 24:53.653
So, what can you tell us
about Hank and Malik?

24:53.687 --> 24:55.455
They took no guff from anybody.

24:55.489 --> 24:56.889
What makes you say that?

24:56.924 --> 24:58.524
They got into a fight with some guy

24:58.559 --> 25:00.126
during one of our last parties.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.194
I had to kick him out.

25:01.228 --> 25:02.328
Who?

25:02.363 --> 25:05.798
Look. We can't trust the police,
so we police ourselves.

25:05.833 --> 25:07.967
That man was a real homophobe.

25:08.002 --> 25:09.702
So we took care of him...

25:10.938 --> 25:14.207
And kept sure he never come back.

25:14.241 --> 25:16.309
Safar Arabi.

25:16.343 --> 25:19.145
It's Safar. Call me back.

25:53.213 --> 25:55.548
Who's the vic'?

25:55.582 --> 25:58.418
Uh, Safar Arabi. We
thought he was a suspect.

25:58.452 --> 26:00.253
What did the ex-fiancée say?

26:00.287 --> 26:02.255
Uh, that she was being a good friend

26:02.289 --> 26:04.223
acting as a beard for Malik.

26:04.258 --> 26:05.425
Did Monty check out safar?

26:05.459 --> 26:07.226
Yeah. Quite the rap sheet.

26:07.261 --> 26:09.362
A lot of disturbing
the peace, assaults.

26:09.396 --> 26:11.397
Huh. So he's a yapper and a scrapper.

26:11.432 --> 26:13.266
What aren't we seeing here?

26:13.300 --> 26:14.967
We thought this was a hate crime,

26:15.002 --> 26:17.270
but by all accounts, both
the first kill, Jabir,

26:17.304 --> 26:19.739
and the latest, Safar, were
not of the gay community.

26:19.773 --> 26:21.708
Well, something is tying
these two together.

26:21.742 --> 26:24.043
Question is, what?

26:25.079 --> 26:26.879
Safar's bag.

26:32.486 --> 26:33.286
Ah.

26:47.368 --> 26:48.968
Hey, guys, take a look at this.

26:50.704 --> 26:52.305
You can tell from their eyes...

26:52.339 --> 26:54.474
That's Safar...

26:54.508 --> 26:56.275
That's Hank...

26:56.310 --> 26:57.944
I'm pretty sure that's Malik.

26:57.978 --> 27:00.847
I don't see Jabir anywhere.

27:00.881 --> 27:02.782
How is he connected to all this?

27:02.816 --> 27:05.151
And what is that banner
they're holding?

27:05.185 --> 27:08.321
"Ash-sha'b yurid isqat an-nizam."

27:08.355 --> 27:10.490
"The people want to
take down the regime."

27:10.524 --> 27:13.760
That's what the protesters
chanted during the Arab Spring.

27:13.794 --> 27:16.763
Safar, Hank, and Malik were protesters.

27:16.797 --> 27:20.166
Which means someone is killing
everyone in this picture.

27:30.010 --> 27:31.444
I need another name.

27:31.478 --> 27:33.112
Who are you?

27:33.147 --> 27:35.214
You work for the government?

27:35.249 --> 27:36.516
Huh?!

27:36.550 --> 27:37.650
Answer me!

27:37.684 --> 27:40.153
Names, or you will hurt some more.

27:40.187 --> 27:41.854
I gave you a name!

27:41.889 --> 27:43.189
I need another!

27:46.393 --> 27:47.593
I can't.

27:48.896 --> 27:51.230
Aaaaah!

27:52.266 --> 27:54.467
You will!

27:57.653 --> 27:59.653
Three of the four
people in this picture

27:59.687 --> 28:00.854
are either dead or missing.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.355
There's only one person left.

28:02.390 --> 28:04.024
So, why is the unsub
targeting these men?

28:04.031 --> 28:05.932
We now know these aren't hate crimes.

28:05.966 --> 28:07.500
It could be about the subversives.

28:07.534 --> 28:09.468
Which Hank and Malik definitely were,

28:09.503 --> 28:11.437
both as protesters and for being gay.

28:11.471 --> 28:13.973
Well, unfortunately, safar's
journal isn't much help

28:14.007 --> 28:15.841
in identifying the group's members.

28:15.876 --> 28:18.678
So far, the only ones I can
make out are Hank and Malik,

28:18.712 --> 28:20.680
whom he refers to
fondly, like brothers.

28:20.714 --> 28:23.082
Then why the blowout at the party?

28:23.116 --> 28:26.152
Hank had started this pro-democracy
group with protesters

28:26.186 --> 28:28.688
weeks before Egypt's Arab Spring began.

28:28.722 --> 28:30.489
He called them the Khepers.

28:30.524 --> 28:31.958
Egyptian name for "scarab."

28:31.992 --> 28:34.260
Only, Safar was the true
brains and organizer

28:34.294 --> 28:35.294
behind the protests.

28:35.329 --> 28:37.630
Two young alpha males in
a heightened situation.

28:37.664 --> 28:40.700
Hank was ready to start fighting
for better gay rights in Egypt.

28:40.734 --> 28:41.701
But Safar wasn't?

28:41.735 --> 28:42.735
Well, not yet.

28:42.769 --> 28:44.537
He felt like the group
hadn't achieved their goals

28:44.571 --> 28:47.006
from the Arab Spring, and
to add yet another cause

28:47.040 --> 28:48.941
would only make it that much harder.

28:48.976 --> 28:51.210
It was a disagreement
over their priorities.

28:51.244 --> 28:53.379
Hank and Malik fought
for the basic rights

28:53.413 --> 28:54.447
of the Egyptian people

28:54.481 --> 28:56.816
when their own freedoms
were still in jeopardy.

28:56.850 --> 28:59.151
And he could identify the
others in the picture.

28:59.186 --> 29:01.687
The unsub was using
Hank for information.

29:01.722 --> 29:05.624
When the unsub gets it,
Hank is as good as dead.

29:06.893 --> 29:08.494
- Hey, Monty.
- Hey.

29:08.528 --> 29:10.629
I'm having no luck with
this facial recognition

29:10.664 --> 29:11.664
of the last protester.

29:11.698 --> 29:12.965
Their face is covered,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.201
and the Egyptian government is
being less than cooperative

29:15.235 --> 29:17.336
with the access to their records.

29:17.371 --> 29:20.539
It's time for me to have a
chat with the deputy minister.

29:32.753 --> 29:35.921
Has your team identified the
last person in the picture?

29:35.956 --> 29:37.390
No.

29:37.424 --> 29:39.892
But we aren't supposed to, are we?

29:39.926 --> 29:41.160
Let me be blunt.

29:41.194 --> 29:45.164
These are starting to feel like
government-sanctioned hits.

29:45.198 --> 29:46.766
You think we're doing this?

29:46.800 --> 29:47.867
You tell me.

29:47.901 --> 29:50.936
I can assure you that we're
not behind any of this.

29:50.971 --> 29:52.104
So it's just coincidence

29:52.139 --> 29:55.474
that Americans and subversives
are dying on your watch.

29:56.643 --> 29:58.377
Maybe you and your team

29:58.412 --> 30:00.413
have overstayed your
welcome, Agent Garrett.

30:00.447 --> 30:02.615
Or maybe we're just getting
closer to the truth.

30:02.649 --> 30:04.050
And which truth is that?

30:04.084 --> 30:06.619
The one where you withhold
information from us

30:06.653 --> 30:08.454
about Malik and Hank's sexuality?

30:08.488 --> 30:10.089
I would have liked to have shared it,

30:10.123 --> 30:12.358
but I have concerns about
your country's policies.

30:12.392 --> 30:14.126
Not the ones you march
out to the world,

30:14.161 --> 30:16.128
but the ones behind closed doors.

30:16.163 --> 30:19.765
You can't possibly condone this
kind of abnormal behavior.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.734
It doesn't matter what
I believe or condone.

30:21.768 --> 30:23.769
It's the law in both our countries.

30:23.804 --> 30:25.071
It's our job to uphold it.

30:26.139 --> 30:27.640
Your government has records

30:27.674 --> 30:31.077
on everything that happened
during the Arab Spring.

30:31.111 --> 30:32.278
I believe you know

30:32.312 --> 30:34.280
who this last person in the picture is.

30:35.782 --> 30:37.716
I can't say we do.

30:39.753 --> 30:41.220
The last I checked,

30:41.254 --> 30:43.989
the U.S. is Egypt's
number-one aid provider.

30:44.024 --> 30:46.792
If you want it to stay that way,

30:46.827 --> 30:49.728
I suggest you get me
what I'm looking for.

30:49.763 --> 30:51.230
Are you threatening me?

30:54.768 --> 30:56.735
Damn straight I am.

31:05.145 --> 31:06.679
How'd that go?

31:06.713 --> 31:07.980
Not sure.

31:08.014 --> 31:09.048
What'd you say?

31:09.082 --> 31:11.784
I threatened that the U.S.
would pull aid to Egypt.

31:11.818 --> 31:12.785
You can do that?

31:12.819 --> 31:13.786
You think I can?

31:13.820 --> 31:14.753
I don't know.

31:14.788 --> 31:15.754
Then it's working.

31:18.792 --> 31:21.494
Every other victim is
accounted for except Jabir.

31:21.528 --> 31:24.396
What's he have to do with
everyone in this picture?

31:27.734 --> 31:30.269
All those photos on Jabir's wall.

31:30.303 --> 31:32.438
He was a photographer. What
if he took the picture?

31:33.473 --> 31:35.875
We need to go speak to
his widow, Neith, again.

31:41.848 --> 31:44.517
Neith's landlord said she
left soon after we did

31:44.551 --> 31:45.618
and hasn't returned since,

31:45.652 --> 31:48.988
but look what the police found
under their mattress...

31:49.022 --> 31:50.689
Jabir's suicide note.

31:51.691 --> 31:52.758
So he wasn't murdered.

31:52.792 --> 31:55.694
Apparently not, but why did
Neith tell us that he was?

31:55.729 --> 31:57.163
Either she doesn't know

31:57.197 --> 31:59.398
or it's a countermeasure to the truth.

31:59.432 --> 32:01.634
What does Jabir say in his letter?

32:01.668 --> 32:04.703
Talks about how he has suffered
for years from gas exposure

32:04.738 --> 32:07.239
while shooting photography
during the Arab Spring

32:07.274 --> 32:09.208
for Hank and the Khepers.

32:09.242 --> 32:11.310
Seems Jabir was the official cameraman

32:11.344 --> 32:12.611
for Hank and his crew.

32:44.211 --> 32:46.712
And here's our modus operandi.

32:46.746 --> 32:48.881
Could be Jabir's.

32:48.915 --> 32:51.584
Well, he may have bought them,
but he only used one on himself.

32:51.618 --> 32:52.952
Look at the imprints in the dirt...

32:52.986 --> 32:54.420
Shows others are missing.

32:55.922 --> 32:57.923
Neith is our unsub.

32:59.226 --> 33:01.560
And her husband's suicide
was the trigger.

33:01.595 --> 33:02.695
If she thought

33:02.729 --> 33:04.630
had her husband never been
involved with the protesters,

33:04.664 --> 33:05.731
he'd still be alive.

33:05.765 --> 33:07.866
But instead of going after
the people who hurt him,

33:07.901 --> 33:10.769
she blames Hank and his group
for putting him in harm's way.

33:10.804 --> 33:13.239
And she's using the same weapon
that injured her husband

33:13.273 --> 33:14.406
to go after her victims.

33:14.441 --> 33:16.408
So the details are important to her.

33:16.443 --> 33:18.377
The use of gas is symbolic.

33:18.411 --> 33:20.646
Trauma-induced retribution seekers

33:20.680 --> 33:23.582
are rarely indifferent to the
specifics of their crimes.

33:23.617 --> 33:26.418
If that's the case, then
maybe Neith is holding Hank

33:26.453 --> 33:28.921
in a location that was
important to the group.

33:30.523 --> 33:32.958
Monty, I need you to show
Malik's mother that photo.

33:32.993 --> 33:34.059
She may know where it was taken.

33:34.094 --> 33:36.962
We believe that's where our
unsub is holding Hank.

33:39.933 --> 33:41.300
Thank you for coming back.

33:41.334 --> 33:43.168
You said it was important.

33:43.203 --> 33:45.938
It is, Mrs. Said. I need your help.

33:45.972 --> 33:48.807
My son is dead. What else
do you want from me?

33:48.842 --> 33:50.743
To help save someone else's son.

33:50.777 --> 33:52.177
A son whose mother is a liar.

33:52.212 --> 33:54.179
Look, Hank is still out there. Now,
if you'll just take a look at this...

33:54.214 --> 33:56.115
I won't! I won't look at anything else!

34:01.121 --> 34:04.356
You know, I spoke to Brenda earlier,

34:04.391 --> 34:05.924
who told me about how Hank and Malik

34:05.959 --> 34:08.327
came out to her farm last summer

34:08.360 --> 34:10.929
and what a lovely time they had.

34:12.565 --> 34:14.967
Now, you may not be able to accept

34:15.001 --> 34:18.603
Hank and Malik's relationship...

34:18.638 --> 34:20.105
But you can't deny it.

34:38.358 --> 34:39.257
Wait.

34:42.896 --> 34:44.295
Let me look at the picture.

34:50.337 --> 34:52.871
Do you know of Malik's
protest in the Arab Spring?

34:52.906 --> 34:54.172
Proudly.

34:54.206 --> 34:56.241
Do you recognize this
location in the photo?

34:56.275 --> 34:57.910
That post.

34:57.944 --> 35:01.914
It's an old archeological dig
site near my family's home.

35:01.948 --> 35:03.682
One year, Malik, his sister, and I

35:03.717 --> 35:05.517
tied a blue ribbon around that post

35:05.552 --> 35:08.220
for my father, who passed away.

35:08.254 --> 35:10.789
It was his favorite color.

35:12.525 --> 35:13.792
Thank you.

35:16.863 --> 35:19.531
Jack, Hank is being held at
an archaeological dig site

35:19.566 --> 35:21.700
16 miles north of your
current position.

35:21.735 --> 35:23.602
Hopefully, the unsub is there, too.

35:23.636 --> 35:26.505
I'm sending coordinates
to the S.U.V.'s nav now.

35:26.539 --> 35:29.842
How are Simmons and Mae doing
identifying the last target?

35:29.876 --> 35:30.976
Well, your bluff worked.

35:31.010 --> 35:33.779
The deputy minister I.D.'d the
last person in the photo.

35:33.813 --> 35:35.214
We located him in a mosque.

35:35.248 --> 35:37.182
Simmons and Mae are on their way now.

36:08.181 --> 36:08.981
Help me!

36:09.015 --> 36:10.949
Somebody help me!

36:15.188 --> 36:15.954
Stop!

36:34.874 --> 36:35.707
Stop!

36:37.310 --> 36:39.144
Neith.

36:39.179 --> 36:40.612
We can help you.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.028
You cannot help me.

36:56.062 --> 36:58.864
Just like no one could help Jabir.

36:58.898 --> 37:01.133
He was an artist, until he met Hank,

37:01.167 --> 37:03.335
who told him he could change
the world with his pictures.

37:03.369 --> 37:05.137
Hank was only trying
to help your husband.

37:05.171 --> 37:06.672
Instead, he doomed him.

37:10.310 --> 37:12.277
Jabir was following
Hank and his friends,

37:12.312 --> 37:14.847
when Mubarak's thugs shot,
stabbed, and gassed them,

37:14.881 --> 37:16.048
like they were nothing.

37:16.082 --> 37:17.850
I know. I know.

37:17.884 --> 37:20.085
What they did to those
protesters was horrible.

37:21.554 --> 37:24.122
Jabir was never the same.

37:24.157 --> 37:27.125
Always there...

37:27.160 --> 37:29.194
But never here.

37:30.597 --> 37:32.130
And for what?

37:33.266 --> 37:36.535
Arab Spring was a failure.

37:36.569 --> 37:39.838
All it brought was pain and suffering.

37:39.873 --> 37:41.940
Change takes time, Neith.

37:43.042 --> 37:44.042
There is no more time.

37:45.712 --> 37:47.312
Think about your daughter.

37:49.549 --> 37:51.149
I am.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.371
Neith!

38:20.427 --> 38:23.296
He was definitely held here.
There's no doubt about it.

38:24.531 --> 38:27.300
So where is Hank now?

38:27.334 --> 38:29.235
Maybe she already gassed
him, like all the others.

38:29.269 --> 38:30.970
Then we'd find his body.

38:32.506 --> 38:35.241
Hank wasn't just another protester.

38:35.275 --> 38:36.809
It was his group.

38:36.843 --> 38:38.344
He led them into danger.

38:38.378 --> 38:40.346
Well, he's the one
Neith sees responsible

38:40.380 --> 38:42.214
for putting her husband in the ground.

38:42.249 --> 38:45.084
We know she was impatient and sadistic.

38:45.118 --> 38:47.653
That gas kills within minutes.

38:47.688 --> 38:49.588
Her husband suffered for
years and then died.

38:49.623 --> 38:51.223
There's no way she'd let
Hank off that easy.

38:51.258 --> 38:52.925
She'd want him to feel pain.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.327
To feel lost and alone,

38:54.361 --> 38:56.295
like her husband did
when he killed himself.

38:57.798 --> 38:59.365
So...

38:59.399 --> 39:01.567
Where do you hide
something in the desert?

39:02.936 --> 39:04.170
You bury it.

39:05.605 --> 39:07.106
She buried Hank alive.

39:20.220 --> 39:21.153
Got it!

39:35.936 --> 39:37.670
Hang in there, Hank!

39:39.439 --> 39:40.339
Hank!

39:40.374 --> 39:42.875
If you can hear me, we're almost there!

40:00.327 --> 40:01.927
We've got you, son.

40:01.962 --> 40:04.363
You're safe now.

40:11.938 --> 40:14.473
Let's get you home, son.

40:16.877 --> 40:18.310
I appreciate your help.

40:18.345 --> 40:20.246
You left me little choice.

40:21.214 --> 40:22.148
I'm sorry about that.

40:23.550 --> 40:26.318
Now it is I that don't believe you.

40:26.353 --> 40:28.187
Your country is in the beginning stages

40:28.221 --> 40:29.355
of your new democracy.

40:29.389 --> 40:32.024
The U.S.A. has over 200 years,

40:32.059 --> 40:34.460
and we're still ironing
out some things.

40:53.513 --> 40:55.214
Ohh!

40:55.248 --> 40:57.016
My baby.

40:57.050 --> 40:58.584
Ohh.

42:02.415 --> 42:03.549
Thank you.
