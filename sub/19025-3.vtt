WEBVTT

00:02.760 --> 00:05.274
<i>Today started out like any other day.</i>

00:07.840 --> 00:10.434
Dolphins won again.

00:10.520 --> 00:13.398
Here you go.
I'm gonna be hearing about this all day.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.958
<i>Dr Cox and Jordan</i>
<i>are still looking for a paediatrician.</i>

00:19.040 --> 00:21.235
This time
try not to scare off the doctor.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.880
- I did not scare off the last guy.
- You bit him.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.474
I tripped and my teeth hit his shoulder.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.314
And once that happened,
did you clamp down a little bit?

00:30.400 --> 00:32.595
- You come on.
- He had a bad attitude.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.990
Remember what Mr Cookiepants says
about blowing your nose.

00:36.080 --> 00:40.551
<i>If it's clear, have no fear</i>
<i>If it's bloody, come see your buddy</i>

00:41.520 --> 00:44.990
- What do you want?
- We're looking for a new paediatrician.

00:45.080 --> 00:48.231
And you figured that
since you're on the board of directors

00:48.320 --> 00:52.950
and Dr Cox here is an attending
and a renowned pain in the ass,

00:53.040 --> 00:55.395
you could show disregard for my schedule

00:55.480 --> 00:58.711
and make me want to cause you
grievous bodily harm?

00:59.880 --> 01:03.429
- Hello, I'm Dr Norris.
- Charmed.

01:03.520 --> 01:06.114
<i>Like I said, same ol', same ol'.</i>

01:08.560 --> 01:10.869
You drew on the wall.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.675
- You pulled the paper away.
- Stop lying. That's gonna come off?

01:17.040 --> 01:21.272
Dan, don't. That's Dad's indelible
space pen and prom is in two weeks.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.795
Good evening, Mr and Mrs Shepherd.
I'm here to pick up Amy for...

01:28.440 --> 01:30.476
...prom.

01:31.520 --> 01:35.877
That'll come off. You won't have to get
laser surgery or skin from your ass.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:52.160 --> 01:53.957
Come on.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.838
<i>Lots of things last longer</i>
<i>than you wish they would,</i>

01:56.920 --> 01:59.912
<i>especially stupid relationships</i>
<i>with stupid trainers</i>

02:00.000 --> 02:01.797
<i>who stole my stupid girl.</i>

02:03.040 --> 02:05.998
Well, I've got whales to train.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.672
Stupid whales.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.558
Hey, Sean. Right on, brother.

02:10.639 --> 02:14.030
- Bye.
- Where the hell are my interns?

02:14.720 --> 02:18.190
<i>As third-year residents, you have to</i>
<i>stay on top of your interns.</i>

02:18.280 --> 02:22.319
These right here, you see these names?
They are called patients.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.073
This one needs brainwork.
This one needs a heart.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.879
- This guy needs courage.
- Helping or hurting?

02:27.960 --> 02:31.714
The point is, they will live or die
based on your lame-ass post ops,

02:31.800 --> 02:34.075
so please, people, shape the hell up.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.071
Yes, Dr Turk.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.117
Dr Jerk.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.270
The girl one just called you Dr Jerk.

02:42.360 --> 02:46.751
No sweat. You should hear
what they call Dr Mickhead.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.751
What?

02:49.600 --> 02:52.398
<i>I decided to take a different tack</i>
<i>with my interns.</i>

02:52.480 --> 02:54.755
Look, guys,
I'm not here to overwork you.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.195
I'm not just your resident.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.953
I'm your buddy. I'm your go-to guy.

03:01.800 --> 03:02.949
I'm J.D.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.474
<i>Of course, my tack</i>
<i>had its own drawbacks.</i>

03:05.560 --> 03:09.872
But it is crucial I have everyone here
at 9am sharp tomorrow.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.155
- Is it cool if I come at 9.30?
- Absolutely.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.310
- Anyone else need to be late?
- I can't.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.550
Why don't we just make it ten, then?

03:16.640 --> 03:18.551
Break.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.194
- I can be here at nine.
- But I said ten.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.516
<i>I guess eve</i> ry <i>one has their own style.</i>

03:26.600 --> 03:28.795
Today for lunch the cafeteria has...

03:28.880 --> 03:31.030
Name a manifestation of hydrocephalus.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.236
- Urinary incontinence.
- Yes, Bruce.

03:33.320 --> 03:36.915
Go place a Foley cath on bed four.
As for the rest of Team E...

03:37.000 --> 03:40.515
If it isn't Dr Haircut and her
Not Ready For Prime Time Players.

03:40.600 --> 03:44.309
Actually, sir, we rock. So, feel free
to sit back and enjoy the show.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.749
Don't worry.
Those are a dime a dozen.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.717
Really?

03:50.800 --> 03:53.951
In fact, if you get bored,
just hijack an ice-cream truck

03:54.040 --> 03:56.315
and drive it through
our new pathology lab.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.311
But spare the paper shredder.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.914
I'll need that
to turn your next 12 paycheques

04:01.000 --> 04:04.470
into a clown wig you can wear
for the rest of your internship.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.757
Dr Reid, you may have
an exciting new look

04:07.840 --> 04:10.798
and a boyfriend who smells
vaguely like my tackle box,

04:10.880 --> 04:13.474
but I remain, as always, underwhelmed.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.709
Dr Norris, what we're looking for
is someone who's not too alarmist

04:22.800 --> 04:24.711
but also not too lax either.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.394
God, please let that someone be me.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.789
You're obviously busy with your doll.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.791
My doll.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.476
- It's a collectible.
- Someone's gonna get his ass bit.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.154
Right. I think
we should probably take off.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.310
We'll be back to you with our decision.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.472
I'll be by my giant pretend phone
pretending to give a crap.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.790
By the way...

04:47.920 --> 04:50.559
Hello. Gotta take it.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.475
- I love him.
- Of course you do. He's you.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.949
Nobody loves you
more than you. You know that.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.508
Still, he is
the best paediatrician on staff,

05:00.600 --> 05:03.034
and since we work here
we'll have a lot of pull.

05:03.120 --> 05:06.317
Come on. You haven't let me
make one decision about our son,

05:06.400 --> 05:09.710
which is why, by the way,
you'll be answering when he asks

05:09.800 --> 05:13.156
why daddy's wee-wee doesn't have
a turtleneck on it like his.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.550
- Fine to whatever you said.
- Hey, Carla.

05:16.640 --> 05:20.349
I had to re-do the N.G. Tube
one of your nurses put on Mrs Himmel.

05:20.440 --> 05:24.194
If you could spread the word to leave
that to me and my guys, it'd be great.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.157
No problem, Bambi.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.356
But the reason my nurses had to do that

05:28.440 --> 05:30.874
is because
none of your interns know how.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.633
So if you keep flapping your mouth,

05:33.720 --> 05:35.756
I'm gonna see
if I can fit my foot in it.

05:35.840 --> 05:40.675
OK. Good talk. Brian, you know
how to place an N.G. Tube, don't you?

05:40.760 --> 05:44.275
- You did it for me both times.
- Jimmy, didn't you do one yesterday?

05:44.360 --> 05:48.069
No, you let me go home cos I forgot
to set my TiVo for <i>Behind the Music.</i>

05:48.160 --> 05:50.720
Do not miss that. It's awesome.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.870
Seth?

05:52.960 --> 05:56.236
<i>That was when I realized</i>
<i>what I'd turned my interns into.</i>

06:04.040 --> 06:06.952
This is gonna be your third Foley cath.
You can do this.

06:07.040 --> 06:11.397
You didn't need to page me 17 times
between the time I bought the rum muffin

06:11.480 --> 06:14.870
and then threw it away
because alcoholism runs in my family.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.839
After this morning I just wanted to
make sure that I really have this down.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.720
- What are you doing?
- It's just a nervous habit.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.917
- It helps me concentrate.
- Know what helps me concentrate?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.719
- Me not doing that?
- No, bunnies.

06:38.840 --> 06:42.276
I don't wanna embarrass you there,
big Jack, but...

06:42.360 --> 06:45.909
you've got a little something
on your face.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.518
Hardly notice it.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.397
What was that?

06:53.480 --> 06:55.596
Don't tell me you're gonna be a parent

06:55.680 --> 06:58.911
who makes a big deal
out of every single cough.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.076
Look out, Mickhead.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.036
OK, tough guy. Goodnight.

07:09.560 --> 07:13.030
What the...?
Maybe I diluted this too much.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.518
Can't blame the cleanser.

07:22.600 --> 07:26.309
<i>Even though my interns sucked,</i>
<i>I decided to turn it into a positive.</i>

07:26.400 --> 07:30.598
Elliot, I need some pointers
on how to deal with my interns.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.239
Hey, Doug.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.153
Do you think we could meet up
after work or something?

07:37.240 --> 07:39.151
Sure. What'd you have in mind?

08:05.440 --> 08:07.351
Nothing major.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.349
It's not a bad thing
that you play with it.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.908
Your mom wants you
to take breaks for meals.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.150
Jack here's got a cough.

08:15.240 --> 08:19.313
On account of the meconium problem
he had, it might be pneumonia.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.675
Benjamin, take this cup.
Fill 'er up, all right?

08:26.440 --> 08:30.194
What in the hell do you think you are
doing, you arrogant son of a bitch?

08:30.280 --> 08:34.477
If you ever interrupt an exam again,
I will shove my stethoscope up your...

08:34.559 --> 08:38.030
- Benjamin, what happened?
- I don't have to go.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.032
That happens to the big boys too.
Try again. Go on.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.759
- Is his temperature under 100.5?
- Barely.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.752
- Eating, peeing, pooing?
- Sometimes at the same time.

08:46.840 --> 08:49.434
It's a really persistent cough.
What do you say?

08:49.520 --> 08:51.988
Office hours. Tomorrow, five o'clock.

08:52.080 --> 08:55.516
I'm gonna put this in a language
that you can understand.

08:55.600 --> 09:01.436
You had better see my son now
or I'm gonna kick your ass.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.474
<i>OK, here she comes.</i>
<i>Don't be over-eager.</i>

09:11.560 --> 09:14.074
Elliot. Over here.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.632
- You look great.
- Thanks.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.109
- Hey, J.D.
- Sean's here, everybody.

09:24.600 --> 09:28.229
Since he's a trainer, Sean
is really good with communication.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.869
He helped with my interns.
I thought he could help you with yours.

09:31.960 --> 09:35.077
<i>Stay calm. At least she's here too.</i>

09:36.920 --> 09:39.195
- Bruce again. Gotta go.
- Bye.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.631
This'll be fun.

09:44.720 --> 09:48.076
<i>And just like that I had</i>
<i>another rough night ahead of me.</i>

09:49.440 --> 09:51.715
<i>At least I wasn't the only one.</i>

09:56.960 --> 09:59.428
You paged me for another Foley catheter?

09:59.520 --> 10:01.909
I'm great at these now.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.956
Just watch this one.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.917
Don't mind if I do.

10:06.800 --> 10:10.588
<i>It's gonna be a long, long night.</i>

10:13.880 --> 10:16.269
I'm right here, Bruce.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.791
Hello, David. I've been expecting you.

10:32.520 --> 10:35.717
I just thought I'd come by
and play with your stuffed animals.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.916
I know. They're for the kids.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.754
Also, wanted to let you know that
I will be bringing my son this morning.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.070
I don't think so there, chief.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.511
Where's Mr Cookiepants?

10:49.920 --> 10:53.595
- I said where's Mr Cookiepants?
- He's in a safe place.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.638
If you touch him,
I'll inject your kid with chickenpox.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.915
No, you won't.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.515
I know. For God's sakes,
it's an innocent doll.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.353
No, David. It's a collectible.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.632
Whatever.

11:10.280 --> 11:14.796
This kid just falls apart every time
Kelso looks over his shoulder.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.836
Why don't you tell Kelso to back off?

11:16.920 --> 11:21.072
I've taken a lot of positive steps
this year, but standing up to Kelso,

11:21.160 --> 11:23.071
I can't get over that hump yet.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.596
- He's like my white whale.
- Mine's Frank.

11:26.680 --> 11:31.151
I meant like in <i>Moby Dick.</i>
Kelso's a giant pain in my ass.

11:32.880 --> 11:37.715
Because I love Frank. Just, he can
drive me crazy every now and then.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.755
Every day.

11:49.520 --> 11:53.035
Let's start out by me watching
how you interact with your interns.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.554
Your brain'll tell you
to be self-conscious,

11:55.640 --> 11:57.437
but ignore the voice in your head.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.556
<i>Kick him in the crotch and run.</i>

11:59.640 --> 12:01.073
I'll try.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.879
Be nice to the teacher.
I'm sleeping with him.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.952
Oh, my God,
I haven't said that since college.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.356
Norris just moved the appointment
back to six, the rat bastard.

12:12.440 --> 12:16.718
Watch your language in front of the kid,
you stupid mickey-fickey.

12:16.800 --> 12:20.793
I am adapting. You, on the other hand,
are behaving like a complete lunatic.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.199
No, I'm not.

12:30.160 --> 12:33.391
Carla. You're one of them
bossy-pants types

12:33.480 --> 12:36.870
who tells people their problems
whether they ask or not, right?

12:36.960 --> 12:39.679
- I've learned when to hold back.
- You're in.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.274
You've totally lost sight
of what's important.

12:42.360 --> 12:46.035
You are a parent now.
You don't come first anymore.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.031
You do what's best for your son,

12:48.120 --> 12:52.989
even if it means sucking up to the one
doctor who's more obnoxious than you.

12:54.080 --> 12:58.358
Oh, my God. I love doing that so much,
it makes my hands shake a little.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.596
How are your interns doing?

13:02.680 --> 13:05.319
It still burns a little,
but at least I can hear OK.

13:05.400 --> 13:09.632
Fantastic, but that's the brachial
artery, and it's not how we draw blood.

13:09.720 --> 13:13.599
If we need to inject him with heroin,
you'll be the first one I call.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.955
What is it?
Do you have something to say?

13:17.280 --> 13:18.269
No.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.669
You remind me of her so much,

13:20.760 --> 13:23.877
you're just a breakdown away
from being the same person.

13:28.240 --> 13:32.233
If you're having trouble with your
case report, I'll be glad to look at it.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.675
Cool. Try to have it back by five.

13:34.760 --> 13:39.356
- I have a lot of things to do, but...
- Can I offer constructive criticism?

13:39.440 --> 13:41.715
<i>Kick him in the crotch, damn it.</i>

13:41.800 --> 13:45.873
You worry so much about whether they
like you that they don't respect you.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.269
One of mine ran out
and got me some dome wax.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.477
Check it. Zing.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.790
It's really shiny.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.428
I had the same problem
with the dolphins...

13:57.520 --> 14:00.557
That's it. I'm sorry. I'm a doctor.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.712
I'm teaching humans, not dolphins.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.792
So it isn't helpful for me
to know what works on fish.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.633
They're mammals, actually.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.951
Unfortunately for me,
my interns aren't mammals.

14:13.040 --> 14:17.079
- They are.
- I don't care.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.355
Come on, Turk.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.190
I don't have a problem with you.
I just can't resist a storm-off.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.236
Who can?

14:34.080 --> 14:37.755
Stain, I won't lie to you.
This is gonna hurt a little bit.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.070
Why don't you just paint over it?

14:45.440 --> 14:47.431
Can you believe what Sean was saying?

14:47.520 --> 14:52.196
He's right. Even in college, you cared
way too much about everybody liking you.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.070
- Who wants to help me move?
- Me.

14:58.040 --> 15:01.237
Could you walk my dog while
I have sex with your friend Miguel?

15:01.320 --> 15:03.151
Love to.

15:04.200 --> 15:08.034
- Who wants to help me move back?
- I know where it all goes.

15:11.240 --> 15:15.279
Think about it, man. Cox has taught you
the most since you've been here.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.794
Does he give a damn
whether you like him or not?

15:17.880 --> 15:21.793
- I'd like to think so.
- Out of my way, space-waster.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.438
I felt the love.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.318
<i>Catch him and kick him in his junk.</i>

15:27.720 --> 15:31.872
Enjoy. I didn't cut the hand off.
I used a different puppet for that.

15:31.960 --> 15:35.509
You could give that one to me
and I could fix it.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.830
And have it for the kids.

15:37.920 --> 15:42.516
Disturbing fetishes aside, I owe you
an apology for acting like a jackass,

15:42.600 --> 15:45.751
but I don't think that my son
should be the one to pay for it.

15:45.840 --> 15:50.072
You think I would endanger the health
of a child because you're a jackass?

15:50.160 --> 15:53.994
Most of the parents I deal with
are jackasses.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.799
- You're in the top five.
- Thank you.

15:56.880 --> 16:00.634
The reason why I've yet to see your
child is because he has the sniffles.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.756
The sniffles?

16:03.840 --> 16:07.958
You're a doctor. You have what I like
to call the burden of knowledge.

16:08.040 --> 16:12.079
You're worse than every parent who
freaks out when their kid eats Play-Doh.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.435
You've seen too much.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.469
You've seen what can really go wrong.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.274
If you don't get a handle on that,
it'll crush you.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.635
- You have kids?
- One.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.750
- She hates dolls.
- That's a bummer.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.751
Tell me about it.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.036
That's horrible work.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.395
I do have something to say.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.913
- Remember earlier you asked me?
- No.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.232
The reason I came back here is because
you said that Bruce and I are alike.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.197
Know what? You're right.

16:46.280 --> 16:49.477
You're treating him
the exact same way you treated me.

16:49.560 --> 16:53.758
You judge us by these 20-minute
pressure-filled windows twice a week.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.195
You never get to know
how hard we really work.

16:56.280 --> 17:00.796
A lot of the times when we fail,
it's not our fault, it's yours.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.633
Is that how you feel, future dentist?

17:06.640 --> 17:11.873
You make me feel I can't do anything
well, and I can do lots of things well.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.109
- Like what?
- I'm a solid human beat box.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.509
He was talking
about medical things.

17:16.599 --> 17:21.435
I'd like to hear him demonstrate
this beef box thing.

17:23.599 --> 17:27.957
I guess this one goes out
to my boy Wayne in room 302.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.436
He has fluid in his lungs.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.993
<i>He's got fluid</i>

18:02.640 --> 18:06.599
Young man, enjoy your moment.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.755
My God, Bruce, that was amazing.
Where did you learn how to do that?

18:11.840 --> 18:14.070
In temple.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.274
You're right.
I can see my reflection.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.271
Tell your friends, baby.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.909
You were right about me and my interns.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.912
- I guess I owe you an apology.
- Damn straight you do.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.116
You know what your problem is...

18:30.200 --> 18:33.715
Please, just one more second.
I need the rush.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.075
I'm coming back for you.

18:36.160 --> 18:40.233
It's no big deal.
We both know that it wasn't about that.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.629
You like Elliot.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.236
- Sorry.
- Don't sweat it.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.914
I'd be pissed off.
Why aren't you pissed off?

18:48.000 --> 18:52.471
I don't know. I guess I just don't
see you as that much of a threat.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.791
Cool.

19:04.240 --> 19:08.074
<i>I don't care. All that matters</i>
<i>is finding a way to sleep at night.</i>

19:09.920 --> 19:13.754
<i>Whether it's finally standing up</i>
<i>to your white whale...</i>

19:15.440 --> 19:17.829
<i>painting over your black spot...</i>

19:21.080 --> 19:24.914
<i>or imagining Shamu</i>
<i>taking Sean's arm off.</i>

19:28.360 --> 19:33.229
<i>You don't need a doctor to say a good</i>
<i>night's sleep can fix almost anything.</i>

19:36.080 --> 19:37.877
<i>He's got fluid</i>

19:38.305 --> 19:44.602
