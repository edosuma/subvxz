Hey! Hey! Amigo!

Wait. Hey!

03:24.465 --> 03:25.466
Hey!

03:26.510 --> 03:27.729
Amigo, untie me!

03:30.122 --> 03:31.646
Untie me, please.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.346
I've pissed off
the Shoemaker enough already.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.218
Yeah, no shit?

03:38.392 --> 03:41.873
I know who you are.
You work for her, right?

03:42.047 --> 03:46.182
I also work for her, man.
She hates me too, yeah.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.228
I lost her dog.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.580
What did you do?

03:53.494 --> 03:55.496
Yeah, a little bit
more than that.

03:57.541 --> 04:00.152
Uh... So...

04:00.327 --> 04:01.850
where are we going? America?

04:02.024 --> 04:04.069
We?Yeah.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.898
I got family in Texas,
Florida, Des Moines--

04:07.072 --> 04:08.291
I was thinking about California.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.641
California! Yeah.
I love California.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.034
Look, mate--

04:12.208 --> 04:14.254
Lupe. My name is Lupe, yeah.Lupe.

04:14.428 --> 04:17.387
I'm sure you'd say anything
to come with me right now,
but I just--

04:17.561 --> 04:19.563
Yeah, you're right about that.
I sure will.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.131
What's your name?

04:24.046 --> 04:26.091
I haven't thought of
the new one yet.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.877
Huh?I'm just done.

04:29.051 --> 04:31.358
I'm gonna get away
from all this violence.

04:32.141 --> 04:33.664
[mariachi

04:37.320 --> 04:40.105
Starting... now?

04:41.498 --> 04:43.457
Yeah, now's good.

04:43.631 --> 04:46.721
Good. Good choice,
I-- I like that.

04:46.895 --> 04:50.246
You and I, buddy,
we're gonna be great friends.
You know that, right?

04:50.420 --> 04:53.380
Man, I see it, just--
Sunday morning, you know,

04:53.554 --> 04:57.340
mimosas for brunch,
you and I driving down PCH

04:57.514 --> 04:59.777
in a convertible red Mustang.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.692
[grunts]
We're gonna kill it![gun cocks]

05:08.003 --> 05:11.485
My client,
this noble man before you,

05:11.659 --> 05:14.226
was burglarized
nearly three months ago.

05:14.401 --> 05:18.274
And your office has only paid
a fraction of the damages
incurred.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.494
There's no way
I'm gonna take a loss.

05:24.149 --> 05:29.111
Tires. My client makes
an honest living selling tires,

05:29.285 --> 05:33.202
and your offices
won't promptly step up
and replace his damages.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.683
I ain't gonna take a loss.

05:35.857 --> 05:39.164
We're drawing up a massive suit
against Sackman/Burns.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.385
If I were you, I'd be terrified.

05:42.559 --> 05:46.433
That's depressing.
Didn't steal enough.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.958
Ray...Okay.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.569
You know the saying,

05:52.743 --> 05:54.702
"If you owe the bank $100,
it's your problem.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.444
But you owe the bank
$100 million,

05:57.618 --> 05:59.141
it's the bank's problem"?

06:00.229 --> 06:02.144
Well, if you're gonna steal,
steal big.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.755
If you're gonna gamble,
gamble big.

06:04.929 --> 06:06.975
Petty shit
never gets you anywhere.

06:09.281 --> 06:12.807
Okay, uh, well, thanks for that.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.112
I'll be drafting
a letter today.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.375
We'll pay the claim...

06:17.289 --> 06:19.814
if you can answer me
just this one question.

06:21.163 --> 06:23.470
Now, we agree that this window

06:23.644 --> 06:25.994
is the sole entry and exit point
of the burglars?

06:26.168 --> 06:27.952
[lawyer laughs]

06:28.126 --> 06:30.999
Have I been talking
to myself this whole time?

06:31.173 --> 06:33.218
No, no, no.
It's just that...

06:33.393 --> 06:37.092
even a Mini Cooper's tire is
a whole lot wider than that.

06:39.050 --> 06:42.663
Mr. Lopez, I believe you.

06:42.837 --> 06:45.274
Somebody broke into your garage,
stole your property,

06:45.448 --> 06:49.234
but you might wanna go
over your claim again.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.281
Seems there's some items
on the list that have been

06:52.455 --> 06:55.589
previously sold, misplaced,
or overlooked and...

06:57.721 --> 07:00.289
there ain't no way
we're taking the loss.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.553
[partner chuckles]

07:03.727 --> 07:05.163
Well, all right.

07:07.078 --> 07:11.735

07:11.909 --> 07:13.824
Whoa!

07:13.998 --> 07:14.956
[laughing]

07:15.130 --> 07:16.610
That actually got me.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.265
All right, muscles.
You get some sleep.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.484
All right?All right.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.141
See you in a sec.See you.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.363
[theme music plays]

07:32.843 --> 07:34.932
[TV narrator]
Time is running out
for our Crane Guys.

07:35.106 --> 07:37.369
[man on TV] There's
no way. There's no way
we can lift this thing!

07:37.544 --> 07:40.851
I don't know if they're gonna
be able to lift this.They always lift it.

07:41.025 --> 07:43.898
Yeah, but, babe,
this time they've only got
15 minutes.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.378
Or what happens?

07:54.038 --> 07:56.388
You're so smart.I know. Told you.

07:56.563 --> 07:59.348
Do I get a cookie?Yeah. Of course
you get a cookie.

08:01.568 --> 08:04.048
So good.Yeah, these are the best
part about meeting me.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.224
You have the best snacks.Yep.

08:11.055 --> 08:14.276
What?You wanna sneak out
to my place?

08:15.407 --> 08:16.800
I can't. I have to watch Julian.

08:16.974 --> 08:19.760
Well, that's the beauty
of my place.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.937
[sighs]

08:23.111 --> 08:24.504
Okay, let's go.

08:29.073 --> 08:32.076
Wow, really-- Just such class.

08:32.250 --> 08:35.863
I never dreamed I'd be
dating a guy who lived
in a mobile home.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.169
Mobile homes
are prefabricated houses

08:38.343 --> 08:40.563
and this baby is a motor home.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.565
Oh!

08:42.739 --> 08:43.827
Or actually a
recreational vehicle,

08:44.001 --> 08:46.134
since it was built after 1976.

08:47.396 --> 08:48.963
It was? Huh!Mmm.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.271
No, no, no, no.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.447
On account of that stuff
being gross.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.101
I mean, how can you
eat that stuff?

08:57.275 --> 09:00.888
Because it's delicious
and familiar.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.631
Miss it if I stopped.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.807
[woman]
Right, well, I understand that.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.809
I'm gonna get Julian
hooked on it, though.

09:13.727 --> 09:16.077
You know Julian loves you.

09:16.251 --> 09:19.123
And you're a hard guy
to get to really know.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.344
You know me.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.476
It's been a year.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.261
Sixteen months.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.306
A great 16 months.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.441
It's just, Julian's starting
to see us as...

09:32.615 --> 09:33.790
a family.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.923
And so I'm wondering...

09:37.185 --> 09:39.013
are we?

09:39.187 --> 09:41.668
I mean,
do you even want a family?

09:42.364 --> 09:43.408
Yeah.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.543
Yeah, of course, one day.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.114
Well, if you wanted
to move in, that'd be great.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.290
If you wanted to move on,
I would be fine.

09:55.464 --> 09:58.075
A little wrecked,
but I'd make it.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.383
But I just can't break
his little heart.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.649
I do want a family.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.566
Seriously.

10:10.740 --> 10:13.743
Two kids.
You know, boy and a girl.

10:16.659 --> 10:19.531
Well, that little guy
would get you halfway there.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.668
[typing]

10:29.541 --> 10:32.544
Man, the tire guy?
That was crazy.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.982
I am definitely mentioning
that in my college classes.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.592
Yeah.

10:36.766 --> 10:39.116
How do you always
get in their head like that?

10:39.290 --> 10:42.163
It's... It's crazy.
It's almost like
you think like a criminal.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.383
Dude, your talents
are wasted here.

10:45.557 --> 10:47.951
I mean, you would kill it
in a poker tournament.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.084
I gave up gambling.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.347
Oh. Well, chess!

10:52.521 --> 10:53.740
I'm more of a checkers man.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.742
There are checkers men?

10:56.786 --> 10:58.266
All right, well, reminds me.Pretty sure.

10:58.440 --> 11:01.791
I do have to get you
to sign my course hours.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.837
Your course hours.Yeah.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.578
All right!All right.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.582
Course hours.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.497
[phone rings]

11:22.116 --> 11:24.553
Hello?Hey, it's me. Lupe.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.337
What's up, buddy?

11:26.511 --> 11:28.209
You still getting out next week?

11:28.383 --> 11:30.994
[Lupe]
I'm not gonna make it
that long, man, okay?

11:31.168 --> 11:35.172
I just found out
I got spotted in here
months ago.

11:35.346 --> 11:39.437
Um... They waited to tell me,
and for them, it paid off.

11:39.611 --> 11:40.917
Paid off? How?

11:41.091 --> 11:43.137
[Lupe]
They've seen you visit, Ray.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.488
Well, did they follow me home?

11:46.662 --> 11:49.752
Well, not them,
because they're in here with me,

11:49.926 --> 11:52.537
but the people on the outside,
yeah, probably.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.105
Look, I don't think
the Shoemaker's been told yet.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.716
Why wouldn't she have been told?

11:56.890 --> 11:58.848
There's a price
on both of our heads, Lupe.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.285
And I don't need
your bullshit optimism
right now.

12:01.459 --> 12:05.028
Look, look.
The spotter's boss
is someone local. Hmm?

12:05.202 --> 12:08.379
I just think they want something
in exchange
for not ratting us out.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.207
If this gets back down to her,

12:10.381 --> 12:12.862
if she finds out,
then anybody around us
could be--

12:13.036 --> 12:14.995
Dead. Yes, I know.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.040
It's gonna be okay.

12:17.214 --> 12:18.781
Just give me some time

12:18.955 --> 12:20.609
and I'll figure out
what they want.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.394
Look, I'm sorry, man.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.267
Probably wishing you left me
in the desert, huh?

12:30.575 --> 12:33.709
Okay. Well, gotta go. Bye.

12:59.256 --> 13:00.867
Fuck!

13:02.520 --> 13:06.742
[breathing heavily]

13:17.187 --> 13:19.233
[phone rings]

13:25.761 --> 13:27.241
[ringing continues]

13:45.215 --> 13:48.001
[motorbike approaching]

14:06.106 --> 14:08.108
Hey, how are you?

14:11.111 --> 14:13.461
You must be Ray, yeah.

14:13.635 --> 14:17.073
Name's Perry,
I work for Grayson.
Heard of him?

14:21.469 --> 14:22.644
He, um...

14:23.993 --> 14:25.473
he wants you at this address.

14:27.257 --> 14:28.345
Now.

14:32.393 --> 14:33.611
So, uh...

14:34.395 --> 14:35.831
if I were you...

14:38.834 --> 14:40.357
I'd get there.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.624
[engine starts]

14:57.418 --> 14:58.810
[message notification]

15:06.296 --> 15:08.603
[machinery clattering]

15:25.837 --> 15:27.317
[indistinct speech]

15:27.491 --> 15:28.928
I want my fucking money!

15:30.233 --> 15:31.495
[cracking][man groans]

15:31.669 --> 15:33.367
Get that?
I want my fucking money!

15:44.247 --> 15:45.248
Hey!

15:48.295 --> 15:49.600
See all this?

15:50.906 --> 15:51.994
My idea.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.779
I told my brother,

15:54.954 --> 15:57.608
if you ever wanna look like
you're losing a lot of money,

15:58.522 --> 15:59.784
buy a newspaper.

16:08.706 --> 16:09.969
You like that, huh?

16:11.361 --> 16:12.362
Yeah, me too.

16:13.407 --> 16:14.886
I got it at an art fair

16:15.061 --> 16:17.498
where they were hawking
turquoise and pottery.

16:17.672 --> 16:20.283
Artist was selling it
for a couple of hundred dollars.

16:20.457 --> 16:23.634
I said,
"Kid, I'll give you
$10,000 for it."

16:23.808 --> 16:25.375
And he looks at me.

16:25.549 --> 16:28.465
And I said, "The only caveat is

16:28.639 --> 16:31.903
I get first dibs
on everything you create
from here on out."

16:32.078 --> 16:33.775
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

16:33.949 --> 16:36.343
You're thinking a guy like me,
bringing art into the world.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.084
But you gotta remember.

16:38.258 --> 16:41.522
The Medicis were criminals,
crooks.

16:41.696 --> 16:45.047
And without them,
you never would've had
a Renaissance.

16:46.309 --> 16:48.050
Wow, well,
that's a really cool story--

16:48.224 --> 16:50.313
Stop it with
the fake American, okay?

16:50.487 --> 16:52.272
I know who you are.
I know your name.

16:52.446 --> 16:55.014
Of course,
your reputation precedes you.

16:55.188 --> 16:59.409
The Shoemaker
was very secretive,
good at hiding things.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.021
It's a good thing she wasn't
very savvy at finding things,

17:02.195 --> 17:03.761
because you'd be dead,
am I right?

17:05.807 --> 17:07.809
If this is a case
of mistaken identity,

17:07.983 --> 17:10.159
I can check with her.
I got her number up here.

17:21.779 --> 17:24.130
[phone ringing]

17:33.008 --> 17:35.489
[ringing continues]

17:41.408 --> 17:44.498
Fine. What's your price?

17:46.152 --> 17:47.153
Thank you.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.764
My price is you work for me.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.635
I'm done with that shit.

17:51.809 --> 17:52.854
Really?Really.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.160
No kidding!

17:54.812 --> 17:57.076
[exclaims] Me too!

17:57.250 --> 17:59.600
After today, I'm pivoting.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.864
Gonna tie up some loose ends.

18:04.561 --> 18:05.780
The thing is...

18:07.042 --> 18:11.177
I've intercepted a package
going to the Shoemaker.

18:11.351 --> 18:14.049
It was too important
for me to pass up.
It means everything.

18:14.223 --> 18:18.097
It's the world,
and it's gonna be here
in a couple of hours.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.447
Now, if the Shoemaker
comes after me,

18:21.100 --> 18:23.537
I want you close.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.235
I can't trust
those knuckle-draggers
over there.

18:26.409 --> 18:27.976
You know what I mean?

18:28.150 --> 18:29.978
They're not clever like you.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.153
[whistles]

18:32.546 --> 18:35.331
All right.
First job, my other place.

18:35.505 --> 18:38.029
I have a neighbor.
He won't cut his tree.

18:38.204 --> 18:41.032
Now I've given him a chance,
but I'm through talking.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.295
Thank you.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.427
You have tools?

18:44.601 --> 18:46.473
I have a new drill,
but I don't like lending it out.

18:47.952 --> 18:48.997
Poison.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.087
Drill?

18:52.261 --> 18:55.046
You make a little hole,
jam in the poison.

18:55.221 --> 18:58.180
Wait, you're blackmailing me
to kill a tree?

18:58.354 --> 18:59.790
Yeah.

18:59.964 --> 19:02.793
What, you think I want you
to poison my neighbor?

19:05.361 --> 19:06.754
[all laughing]

19:08.364 --> 19:09.931
Right? Hard no.

19:10.105 --> 19:12.281
Yeah. Okay,
I thought you'd say that.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.979
Brando, give me your phone,
will you?

19:15.154 --> 19:19.549
Okay, I wanna show you something
that took place
just a little while ago.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.162
[Lupe shouting]

19:23.336 --> 19:24.337
Stop...

19:25.990 --> 19:27.775
Please, please...

19:28.950 --> 19:31.779
[shouting,
beating sounds continue]

19:33.781 --> 19:35.696
[filters popping on]

19:36.740 --> 19:38.394
Aw, Jesus.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.440
I must have pressed
the wrong button.

19:40.614 --> 19:42.746
But I think
you get the point, right?

19:44.444 --> 19:45.662
Weirdest thing to me?

19:45.836 --> 19:48.361
How guys have phones in there.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.928
But it won't be close
to what the Shoemaker does

19:51.102 --> 19:53.844
to him or you
or your loved ones.

19:54.976 --> 19:57.805
The woman, Faith, her kid.

19:58.327 --> 19:59.807
Ooh.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.852
What's this?

20:02.026 --> 20:05.247
Is this when we get to see
the old Ray
I heard so much about?

20:05.421 --> 20:07.945
No, but he's fucking knocking.

20:08.119 --> 20:10.078
All right, all right.
Break it up, you two.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.428
We're on the same team now.

20:12.602 --> 20:15.170
I don't see
what the problem is here.
You're gonna be safe with me.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.607
I take care of my own.
I'll take care of you.

20:21.132 --> 20:23.004
You must really hate this tree.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.399
You're gonna be fun
to have around.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.401
Good! Good, good, good!

20:28.575 --> 20:31.099
All right. First things first.
Take care of the tree.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.493
Herbicide, it's called.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.409
Do your fucking pickup!

21:01.521 --> 21:03.218
[motorbike driving]

21:08.615 --> 21:12.227
[groaning]

21:28.896 --> 21:30.637
[phone rings]

21:33.857 --> 21:35.337
[dance music
plays through phone]

21:35.511 --> 21:37.600
[Brando]
Ray, the tree can wait.

21:37.774 --> 21:40.168
Fucking idiot Perry
dumped his bike
on the way to the pickup.

21:40.342 --> 21:45.260
Fucking-- Fucking
dumped his bike.
Forget the tree, just...

21:45.434 --> 21:47.871
[dance music plays
on car stereo]

22:04.410 --> 22:05.541
Subtle.

22:06.499 --> 22:07.630
Likewise.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.070
440 grand in here.

22:13.244 --> 22:17.161
I don't have to tell you
what my brother will have me do
if you run off on us.

22:18.946 --> 22:19.947
How's Lupe?

22:21.383 --> 22:24.125
Your buddy's in the infirmary.
He'll pull through.

22:25.648 --> 22:29.435
Get him a message.You really testing me
right now?

22:29.609 --> 22:32.829
You run errands for us,
not the other way.

22:33.003 --> 22:34.962
Tell him I'm glad
I didn't leave him.

22:35.136 --> 22:38.487
That is as cryptic as hell,
but sure.

22:38.661 --> 22:40.315
Fuck it! I'll pass it on!

22:44.885 --> 22:46.800
Guy's name is Ninni.

22:46.974 --> 22:49.977
It's a public place.
It's called East Jesus.

22:50.978 --> 22:54.111
Museum, there's some old junk.

22:55.156 --> 22:57.201
Don't worry.
You'll fit right in.

24:48.965 --> 24:52.795
[women chatting, laughing]

24:52.969 --> 24:55.102
[woman]
Would you rather we start over?

24:55.276 --> 24:56.320
[woman 2] Okay.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.762
All right.

25:03.371 --> 25:04.415
Not yet.

25:14.513 --> 25:18.038
Fuck.

25:18.212 --> 25:20.127
Isn't ketchup water the worst?

25:21.650 --> 25:22.651
Mmm.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.523
[continues squeezing ketchup]

25:24.697 --> 25:26.350
Yeah.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.266
You know what I think about
when I eat chicken?

25:29.440 --> 25:31.617
I think
how this used to be a T. rex.

25:33.793 --> 25:36.970
Millions of years ago,
this guy's ancestor

25:37.144 --> 25:40.408
was the most fearsome thing
to ever walk on land.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.323
Then catastrophe hits.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.455
And they had to shrink down,

25:44.630 --> 25:47.676
evolve to this miserable
little creature,

25:48.808 --> 25:52.725
so weak that its very name
means "coward."

25:53.377 --> 25:54.248
[Ray] Ah.

25:54.422 --> 25:56.337
[chuckles]

25:57.947 --> 26:02.648
Yeah, I see what you did there.
That was-- That was
very clever, yeah.

26:02.822 --> 26:06.608
Now we're gonna make this
exchange, or I'm just
gonna fucking take it from you.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.744
You do have some balls.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.963
You wanna find out?

26:14.137 --> 26:16.270
[woman]
Excuse me, boys!

26:16.444 --> 26:19.839
Do you guys mind moving
out of the way,
maybe somewhere over there?

26:20.753 --> 26:23.059
Please? Thanks.

26:23.233 --> 26:25.584
All right, how's my hair?

26:28.369 --> 26:29.588
Do we...

26:33.374 --> 26:35.550
Do you wanna grab yours
and I'll grab mine?

26:40.120 --> 26:43.166
Grayson won't even tell
his own brother what that is.

26:44.515 --> 26:48.519
But Grayson loves a deal,
so it must be something big,

26:48.694 --> 26:51.087
bigger than the 440
he's paying for it.

26:52.567 --> 26:54.177
You got a guess?

26:56.049 --> 26:58.617
You know, I've evolved
to be less curious.

26:59.879 --> 27:01.010
[laughs]

27:03.970 --> 27:05.362
I ain't done.

27:06.494 --> 27:07.887
Yeah, you are.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.411
[clicks tongue]

27:39.179 --> 27:40.484
[pats bag]

27:41.355 --> 27:42.356
[chuckles]

27:42.530 --> 27:44.227
[phone rings]

27:47.927 --> 27:49.058
Oh.

27:51.365 --> 27:52.583
Hey, babe! Hey.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.107
Tried you at work.

27:54.281 --> 27:57.371
Yeah, I'm... I'm not there.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.416
I know. I can hear you driving.

27:59.590 --> 28:02.985
So, where are you driving off to
in the middle of a Tuesday, Ray?

28:03.159 --> 28:05.988
You know, nowhere much. Just...

28:06.641 --> 28:08.512
nowhere much.

28:08.687 --> 28:12.125
Something came up,
but I'm working on it.

28:13.213 --> 28:14.823
Are you running, Ray?

28:14.997 --> 28:18.000
[pop, hissing]

28:18.174 --> 28:19.567
I gotta call you back, okay?

28:19.741 --> 28:21.743
Think I just got a flat tire.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.050
Yeah.

28:37.411 --> 28:39.674
[air hissing]

29:01.435 --> 29:03.872
[carnival horn
honking in background]

29:14.100 --> 29:17.407
[reggae playing from vehicle]

29:47.437 --> 29:48.612
[grunts]

29:55.402 --> 29:56.795
Throw it in the Jeep!

29:57.665 --> 29:59.319
[gunshot]

30:13.507 --> 30:15.465
It goes under the road!
Go back up!

30:20.209 --> 30:21.776
[gunshot]

30:25.432 --> 30:26.955
[gunshot]

30:28.304 --> 30:29.828
[tires screeching]

30:38.706 --> 30:39.838
[gunshots]

30:41.448 --> 30:43.232
[gun clicks]

30:47.149 --> 30:48.977
[pants]

30:49.151 --> 30:50.761
Oh, man!

30:53.677 --> 30:55.679
[grunts]

30:55.854 --> 30:58.726
Okay, okay...

31:21.705 --> 31:24.099
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

31:24.273 --> 31:27.059
A little bit further.
Come on, mate.
Come on, mate.

31:36.764 --> 31:37.808
Okay.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.862
[engine stops]

31:55.174 --> 31:56.436
[grunting]

32:39.783 --> 32:40.959
Okay.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.144
Okay.

33:21.521 --> 33:24.350
[classical music plays]What an idiot.

33:24.524 --> 33:26.047
[Perry breathing heavily]

33:26.221 --> 33:28.397
[ringtone plays]

33:29.355 --> 33:30.356
Ray?

33:31.531 --> 33:32.880
Woman I've been chasing.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.925
Well, you know what they say.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.232
Man chases a woman
until she catches him.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.019
Hey, baby.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.152
It's bad.

33:44.326 --> 33:46.676
How bad?He got away.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.330
He what?

33:48.504 --> 33:50.332
With the money or the pickup?

33:50.506 --> 33:52.334
Both.Both?

33:54.336 --> 33:55.859
Yeah, both days are good.

33:57.731 --> 33:59.515
What the fuck?

33:59.689 --> 34:02.562
Unlike Perry,
this guy really knows
how to handle himself.

34:02.736 --> 34:05.478
You were supposed to be able
to handle yourself.

34:06.696 --> 34:10.135
You and your brother need
to make Ray disappear.

34:10.309 --> 34:12.050
My brother's dead.

34:13.616 --> 34:15.488
Shit!

34:15.662 --> 34:17.577
Well, that makes things
a little harder.

34:19.579 --> 34:20.971
I have never seen my brother

34:21.146 --> 34:23.713
as excited about anything
as he is about this.

34:23.887 --> 34:25.628
Must be a fortune.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.804
I think I've figured out
which way this asshole went.

34:28.414 --> 34:29.893
You better.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.592
Otherwise, we're both fucked.

34:32.766 --> 34:36.161
Both of us? Yeah, Ninni. Handle this.

34:36.335 --> 34:38.641
Or he's gonna slit
both of our throats.

34:38.815 --> 34:40.469
Come on! Enough already!

34:41.644 --> 34:42.776
Yeah, baby, I gotta go.

34:44.952 --> 34:45.996
Fuck.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.219
[Grayson]
All right, come on. Let's go.Where are we going?

34:51.393 --> 34:52.916
Ray's house.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.441
Just in case he gets
any ideas about running away.

35:14.373 --> 35:16.462
[hornets buzzing]

35:23.425 --> 35:25.514
[grunting, panting]

35:29.214 --> 35:32.130
Oh, Yes! Fuck yes!

35:40.747 --> 35:42.662
[grunting]

35:42.836 --> 35:44.316
No fucking handles.

35:55.936 --> 35:58.199
[man] Do you have a gun?No!

36:00.114 --> 36:04.553
No, I'm just trying
to buy this car.
It's beautiful. What is it, '78?

36:04.727 --> 36:07.600
[lisps]
It's not mine to sell.Okay.

36:09.079 --> 36:10.298
Do you have a car?

36:10.864 --> 36:12.518
[laughing]

36:12.692 --> 36:14.128
Well, you're not picky.

36:15.347 --> 36:17.305
I'll also pay you
to use a phone.

36:17.479 --> 36:20.090
No, I don't have a phone.
But I got a radio.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.530
It's for the police.
Here, you wanna call 'em?

36:26.314 --> 36:27.359
Oh...

36:27.533 --> 36:28.838
What happened?

36:29.012 --> 36:30.188
[sighs]

36:31.145 --> 36:32.625
I was cleaning my shotgun and--

36:32.799 --> 36:34.801
Wait. I thought you said
you didn't have a gun.

36:34.975 --> 36:37.412
Oh, no. I don't have a gun here.

36:37.586 --> 36:38.892
I don't have a gun here.

36:42.156 --> 36:43.288
Look...

36:44.332 --> 36:46.291
I'd like to invite you in,
but...

36:47.640 --> 36:49.163
you seem like a certain type.

36:50.120 --> 36:53.559
Little rough. No nonsense?

36:53.733 --> 36:55.213
I'm not rough.

36:55.387 --> 36:57.258
Some nonsense, but...

37:01.697 --> 37:02.916
Come on.

37:07.007 --> 37:12.012
Oh, hey, stay away
from that area.
It's falling apart.

37:12.186 --> 37:13.709
It's okay, mate.

37:14.928 --> 37:17.278
I don't wanna know.What?

37:17.452 --> 37:20.063
I'm just saying
I don't care
what you do out here.

37:20.238 --> 37:24.981
I'm sure lots of people
around these parts cook,
you know, stuff.

37:25.634 --> 37:26.722
I don't judge.

37:26.896 --> 37:28.202
You mean meth?

37:28.376 --> 37:30.726
Oh! No,
that's not my thing.

37:30.900 --> 37:33.338
No, I say no to drugs.Me too.

37:33.512 --> 37:35.340
I'm a beer guy.

37:35.514 --> 37:38.038
Beer, yeah.Hey, come on.
I'll show you my man cave.

37:38.212 --> 37:39.169
[laughing]

37:39.344 --> 37:40.432
Yeah.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.478
Boom!

37:44.610 --> 37:46.873
Here's my man cave! [laughing]

37:48.701 --> 37:49.919
Wow.

37:50.877 --> 37:52.966
So you live here?

37:53.140 --> 37:55.316
Yeah. Just for now, yeah.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.579
Why? Where do you live?

37:58.754 --> 38:00.452
An old RV.

38:00.626 --> 38:03.106
What? Really?Yeah.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.500
You know what really bugs me?

38:05.674 --> 38:08.373
It's when people call 'em
"motor homes" instead of
"recreational vehicles."

38:08.547 --> 38:11.071
Yes. Yes!But what's even worse

38:11.245 --> 38:12.986
is when older people
call them all...

38:13.160 --> 38:16.032
Winnebagos!Winnebagos! Yeah.

38:16.206 --> 38:18.339
Hey, my buds call me Billings.

38:18.513 --> 38:19.949
I'm Ray.

38:22.604 --> 38:26.739
Oh, yeah, part
of the job description
is killing pests.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.481
Shoot 'em,
blow up any gopher holes.

38:29.655 --> 38:31.657
This right here
is called varmint killer.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.529
[high pitched groan]

38:34.703 --> 38:37.097
You-- You good there, mate?Yeah, yeah.

38:37.271 --> 38:39.578
It's just I'm out here
in the middle of nowhere
using words like "varmint"

38:39.752 --> 38:40.883
like I'm Yosemite Sam.

38:41.754 --> 38:42.755
Well...

38:44.060 --> 38:45.148
Hmm!

38:47.237 --> 38:49.544
You know, I thought
I was headed towards
a better life myself, but...

38:49.718 --> 38:52.982
Well, delivery driver's
due this afternoon.

38:53.156 --> 38:55.289
[echoing]
Maybe they can take you
to the next town.

38:55.463 --> 38:57.639
That or a phone.Hey. Hey.

38:59.249 --> 39:02.035
[echoing] I'm
telling you, bro,
that shit's gotta come out.

39:02.644 --> 39:04.690
[grunts]

39:04.864 --> 39:07.823
My grandmammy told me
that the toughest asshole

39:07.997 --> 39:11.174
can be taken down
by the tiniest piece of metal.

39:12.393 --> 39:13.612
It's hospital or me.

39:14.787 --> 39:15.788
You choose.

39:18.094 --> 39:19.487
All right.

39:19.661 --> 39:22.098
Yeah, come on!
Do-si-do. Here's my partner.

39:22.272 --> 39:24.840
Hey, watch my collectibles.

39:32.152 --> 39:33.545
[Grayson]
This is Ray's life?

39:36.852 --> 39:38.288
That's depressing.

39:39.464 --> 39:41.466
I hate it when good things
happen to bad people.

39:42.554 --> 39:44.251
World's gone nuts.

39:44.425 --> 39:47.515
So, if he has
skipped town on us,
what do you wanna do?

39:47.689 --> 39:49.604
Well, the ancient Romans
used to take a guy,

39:49.778 --> 39:52.999
put him in a sack with a dog,
a snake, and a monkey.

39:53.173 --> 39:54.827
And just dump 'em in the river.

39:56.785 --> 39:59.092
But we don't have
any of those things.

40:01.660 --> 40:04.445
[ringtone plays]

40:06.926 --> 40:08.057
Not Ray.

40:09.450 --> 40:10.495
Hey, baby!

40:12.801 --> 40:13.976
There were some tracks.

40:14.150 --> 40:15.804
They're gone now.

40:15.978 --> 40:17.850
Sending you a map
of my location.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.026
Can't be far.

40:20.200 --> 40:23.638
Okay, baby. I gotta go, though.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.648
You sure you don't want
any anesthesia?

40:33.822 --> 40:36.303
I really recommend it.No, I can't.

40:37.347 --> 40:39.828
I have to stay conscious,

40:40.002 --> 40:41.177
get back.

40:41.351 --> 40:43.397
You have-- You have an RV.

40:45.355 --> 40:47.009
Where do you have to
get back to?

40:47.183 --> 40:50.012
I got a tree to poison.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.494
It's a long story.

40:57.063 --> 41:00.327
[Grayson] I knew I should have
done this myself.
I can't trust anybody else.

41:00.501 --> 41:01.720
All right.

41:01.894 --> 41:03.504
We'll come back
for the broad later.

41:03.678 --> 41:05.463
Okay, Perry, drive.
Salton Sea.

41:05.637 --> 41:07.465
I'll handle it.
You stay here.

41:08.204 --> 41:09.554
I'm sorry, what?

41:10.946 --> 41:12.992
What did you say,
little brother?
You'll handle it?

41:13.166 --> 41:14.689
What, you running things now?

41:15.516 --> 41:17.431
I said I'll handle it.

41:17.605 --> 41:20.434
It's too valuable.Well, how much is it?

41:21.653 --> 41:23.045
Fuck the money.
It's the package.

41:23.219 --> 41:24.569
Well, what's in the package?

41:25.178 --> 41:26.353
You'll see.

41:27.746 --> 41:29.878
Along with
the rest of the world.

41:32.577 --> 41:34.100
[engine starts]

41:36.319 --> 41:38.017
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

41:39.018 --> 41:41.194
Thank you.You're welcome.

41:42.412 --> 41:43.979
Seems like you would know.

41:46.286 --> 41:47.679
Those other wounds.

41:48.549 --> 41:49.811
Where'd they come from?

41:51.334 --> 41:53.119
I'd rather forget.

41:54.642 --> 41:56.078
I hear you.

41:58.733 --> 42:03.346
A few years ago,
I fell off a ladder
putting up the Christmas lights

42:03.521 --> 42:09.048
and I-- I broke the nerves
in this hand.

42:09.222 --> 42:11.354
I can--
I can barely feel this hand.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.531
Except for some nights...

42:14.706 --> 42:16.534
you won't believe this,
it itches.

42:22.104 --> 42:23.976
Hmm.

42:27.675 --> 42:28.894
Okay, okay.

42:29.068 --> 42:31.331
Go slow, go slow.Yeah, yeah.

42:32.114 --> 42:33.725
[groaning]

42:35.161 --> 42:36.292
[exhales]

42:37.816 --> 42:41.036
So, what do I owe you
for the patch?No, nothing. Nothing.

42:41.210 --> 42:42.560
Mm-mmm.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.476
I don't like to owe.

42:49.305 --> 42:51.699
Let me buy the 'Vette.

42:51.873 --> 42:55.573
I'll give you 20 grand for it.I told you.
It's not mine to sell.

42:55.747 --> 42:57.879
You're killing me, Billings.
Come on.

42:59.707 --> 43:04.799
Well, the patch
may have been free,
but for the bottle.

43:06.366 --> 43:07.410
Take it.

43:07.933 --> 43:09.456
Rest a bit.

43:10.892 --> 43:12.328
You rest.

43:27.692 --> 43:30.477
[Brando]
East Jesus is not so far.

43:30.651 --> 43:32.479
We should get back to the car.

43:34.002 --> 43:35.787
I wanted to see this.

43:38.311 --> 43:40.879
You know this lake
was made by accident?

43:41.053 --> 43:43.882
Dam broke,
filled it with water.

43:44.056 --> 43:46.319
When I was a kid,
this was a huge
tourist destination.

43:46.493 --> 43:48.234
Now, look at it. It's poison.

43:49.409 --> 43:51.019
It stinks.
It's rotten.

43:51.890 --> 43:53.369
It's depressing.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.679
Nothing to be done.
It's the way of things.

44:00.246 --> 44:02.509
Call it what you want,
entropy, whatever.

44:03.815 --> 44:06.600
Our world is decaying
right before our eyes,

44:06.774 --> 44:08.646
aging, dying.

44:10.125 --> 44:12.737
It's going so fast,
we don't even notice it.

44:14.347 --> 44:16.349
I noticed
it's getting worse out there.

44:17.480 --> 44:19.178
Everybody's
at each other's throats.

44:19.352 --> 44:22.790
That's different, okay?
That's not our fault.

44:22.964 --> 44:27.055
That's 'cause of something
that happened ten years ago.Like what?

44:27.229 --> 44:30.755
All right, I'm gonna
tell you something that
I haven't told anybody, okay?

44:30.929 --> 44:32.626
This is really important to me.

44:34.454 --> 44:37.022
You ever hear of
the Mandela Effect?

44:37.196 --> 44:40.199
You're gonna tell me
anyway, so--Shut up, asshole. Just listen.

44:43.724 --> 44:47.380
It's named after the fact
that millions upon millions
of people swear

44:47.554 --> 44:51.689
that Nelson Mandela passed away
in prison in the 1980s.

44:51.863 --> 44:56.084
So there's a discrepancy
between historical record

44:56.258 --> 44:58.391
and what people remember.

44:58.565 --> 45:02.221
And there are countless
examples of it, especially
in popular culture, okay?

45:02.395 --> 45:04.136
Um, um, um...

45:04.310 --> 45:08.053
Darth Vader never said,
"Luke, I am your father," okay?

45:08.227 --> 45:12.448
Hannibal Lecter in
Silence of the Lambs
never said, "Hello, Clarice."

45:12.622 --> 45:16.104
The Monopoly Man, okay?
The Monopoly Man
never wore a monocle.

45:16.278 --> 45:19.891
An eyepiece. Yeah, he did--Yeah, yeah. No, he didn't.

45:20.065 --> 45:25.287
The theory is, ten years ago,
we split into a parallel
universe, a darker one.

45:25.461 --> 45:26.854
Franky, what the fuck
are you talking about?

45:27.028 --> 45:30.075
No, no, no!
I'm not alone on this, okay?

45:30.249 --> 45:34.253
The effect explains
why society is acting so crazy,

45:34.427 --> 45:36.864
why it's become
so divisive, okay?

45:37.038 --> 45:40.912
Multiverses or time travelers
or powers beyond our control

45:41.086 --> 45:42.740
are making us act this way.

45:42.914 --> 45:44.872
It's not our fault!
We're being manipulated!

45:45.046 --> 45:48.006
People think that it's hackers
or that it's propaganda...

45:48.180 --> 45:49.311
Son of a bitch....and it's not.

45:49.485 --> 45:50.878
I know!I could've sworn

45:51.052 --> 45:52.967
he was wearing an eyepiece!Okay, here's one!

45:53.141 --> 45:55.753
And I swear to God this is true!

45:55.927 --> 45:58.625
You remember
the comedian Sinbad, right?

45:58.799 --> 46:01.933
Okay, Sinbad made a movie
about a genie.

46:02.107 --> 46:04.849
Now I saw this movie!
Do you understand me?

46:05.023 --> 46:09.027
Now people are saying
it was never made,
but I'm telling you I saw it!

46:09.201 --> 46:10.855
I can see it in my mind's eye!

46:11.029 --> 46:13.248
I can see it
at the video store on the shelf!

46:13.422 --> 46:14.946
I believe you, boss.Will you shut up?

46:15.120 --> 46:17.513
Shut up!
I'm talking to
my fucking brother!

46:17.687 --> 46:19.124
Get out of here!

46:19.298 --> 46:20.516
Get out of here!

46:21.430 --> 46:23.041
Jesus! Goddamn it!

46:28.698 --> 46:32.572
Listen, you've no doubt noticed
that I got a lot going on,
right?

46:32.746 --> 46:34.966
And I want you to know
that I appreciate everything
you're doing,

46:35.140 --> 46:37.011
the way that you're handling
everything you're handling.

46:37.185 --> 46:38.796
You've been a real partner.

46:39.971 --> 46:41.407
You've been a brother.

46:43.583 --> 46:46.238
In a couple of days,
this will all be over,
and we'll talk.

46:48.893 --> 46:50.808
Come on. Let's go.

46:57.379 --> 46:58.598
[sighs]

47:13.308 --> 47:15.093
Hey, I think you
locked the door.

47:16.355 --> 47:17.443
Billings!

47:17.617 --> 47:19.140
I asked you to rest.

47:19.314 --> 47:21.490
Is that why you locked me in?

47:21.664 --> 47:24.232
[speaking without lisp]
I can't be letting you leave
just quite yet now, can I?

47:24.406 --> 47:27.409
Wait a minute.
Your accent just changed.

47:28.846 --> 47:31.500
Your whole thing just changed.

47:31.674 --> 47:35.287
Well, you show up shot,

47:35.809 --> 47:37.550
$20,000 on you.

47:38.812 --> 47:40.509
Gotta be more to this story.

47:42.511 --> 47:44.339
Okay, well, how's this?

47:44.513 --> 47:49.692
Story's over, and you just
made yourself 20 grand.
Sound good?

47:49.867 --> 47:53.609
Where there's 20 grand,
I'll wager there is more.

47:54.436 --> 47:55.655
Lots more.

47:57.918 --> 47:59.354
You played me.

48:02.096 --> 48:04.707
You waited till
I dropped my guard,
and you played me.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.884
I been waiting too long, son.

48:08.363 --> 48:10.148
Waiting my whole fucking life.

48:11.366 --> 48:12.672
You know, they lie to you.

48:12.846 --> 48:14.326
They tell you,
if you just hang in there,

48:14.500 --> 48:16.763
the world's
gonna give you your break,

48:16.937 --> 48:18.286
your turn.

48:19.374 --> 48:20.854
But it doesn't.

48:23.204 --> 48:26.816
You gotta take everything
you can get,
so here I am.

48:27.730 --> 48:28.906
Taking.

48:30.342 --> 48:33.998
Well, before you take from me,

48:34.172 --> 48:36.739
just know that people
have killed for that money.

48:38.611 --> 48:40.918
I've killed for that money.

48:43.311 --> 48:44.312
Wait here.

48:46.314 --> 48:47.315
No!

48:48.142 --> 48:50.405
Open the fucking door, Billings!

48:51.493 --> 48:52.712
Billings!

48:54.714 --> 48:56.455
Fuck! Okay...

49:20.479 --> 49:22.089
[grunts]

49:34.754 --> 49:35.929
Fuck!

49:45.547 --> 49:47.158
[cocks gun]

49:56.471 --> 49:59.257
Okay. Drink up, bitch.

50:03.261 --> 50:04.305
Okay.

50:16.839 --> 50:18.754
Okay, okay.

50:20.104 --> 50:21.888
Another fucking lock.

50:22.454 --> 50:23.542
Okay.

50:40.602 --> 50:41.777
[chuckles]

50:41.951 --> 50:44.128
Ray, you should know
that I'm armed.

50:47.566 --> 50:49.263
All right. I'm coming in, Ray.

50:51.787 --> 50:53.267
[screams]

50:58.316 --> 51:01.014
[Ray screaming]

51:01.188 --> 51:04.800
[singing]
I keep some traps out here, Ray,

51:04.974 --> 51:07.281
but you know that now

51:07.455 --> 51:09.979
'cause you don't need your legs

51:10.154 --> 51:12.069
to show me
where the money's at, Ray.

51:12.243 --> 51:14.506
You thought
we were playing checkers,

51:14.680 --> 51:17.465
I was playing chess.

51:17.639 --> 51:21.078
I'm really fucking good
at checkers!

51:21.252 --> 51:22.514
[grunts]

51:26.300 --> 51:27.388
[grunting]

51:29.042 --> 51:31.044
[panting]

51:39.574 --> 51:41.533
[grunting]

51:47.582 --> 51:48.670
[coughing]

51:49.497 --> 51:50.977
Bags. Where?

51:52.457 --> 51:55.155
We gotta go.Sure, I'm gonna send you.

51:55.329 --> 51:57.026
But first, where are the bags?

51:57.201 --> 52:02.467
Look, you know I've gotta bring
Grayson the pickup, but...

52:04.469 --> 52:07.994
I'll give you the rest
of the cash,
and let's call it even.

52:08.168 --> 52:10.736
We ain't yet even
for my brother.

52:12.694 --> 52:14.261
Both bags. Where?

52:15.654 --> 52:16.959
There. Look!

52:17.134 --> 52:19.875
It's there?
Well, let me just turn around.

52:20.049 --> 52:22.443
Yes! Turn the fuck around!
Oh!

52:22.617 --> 52:24.141
Cutting me out of negotiations?

52:25.403 --> 52:26.926
You wanna make a deal?

52:27.753 --> 52:29.233
Try to cut me out?

52:39.330 --> 52:41.158
[gunshot]

52:42.115 --> 52:43.986
I'm shooting to wound, Ray.

52:45.205 --> 52:46.293
Trying to.

52:57.130 --> 53:00.742
One way in,
one way out of there!

53:03.615 --> 53:05.269
[phone ringing]

53:08.576 --> 53:10.796
[ringing continues]

53:19.500 --> 53:20.632
Hello?

53:20.806 --> 53:22.242
[Faith] Hello?

53:22.416 --> 53:24.331
This is Dr. Topaz.

53:25.158 --> 53:26.638
Dr. To--

53:27.291 --> 53:28.553
I'm sorry, do I--

53:30.424 --> 53:31.338
Is Ray there?

53:31.512 --> 53:32.992
I'm afraid to tell you

53:33.166 --> 53:34.776
that Ray was in an accident.

53:34.950 --> 53:37.214
It involved
a recreational vehicle.

53:37.953 --> 53:39.738
I-Is he all right?

53:39.912 --> 53:42.088
Sir, I'm his--
I'm his girlfriend.
I'm Faith Dryer.

53:42.262 --> 53:46.310
Well, Ms. Dryer,
he wouldn't be in a hospital

53:46.484 --> 53:48.660
if he were all right.Fuck, fuck, fuck. No.

53:48.834 --> 53:50.662
No, Faith, no!

53:50.836 --> 53:52.229
He's limping along.

53:54.318 --> 53:55.754
[roars]

53:56.972 --> 53:59.758
Okay, well,
we're at the end of a dirt road.

54:00.454 --> 54:01.673
[grunts]

54:03.588 --> 54:05.459
How stat can you be here?

54:05.633 --> 54:09.028
Um... two hours.
I just-- I have to get a sitter.

54:09.202 --> 54:11.422
Okay. See you soon, Ms. Dryer.

54:12.423 --> 54:14.381
Be quick, but don't hurry.

54:15.034 --> 54:16.122
Okay.

54:18.864 --> 54:22.520
Two hours,
she's gonna drive right to me.

54:24.173 --> 54:29.570
Unless you wanna tell me
where the money
and this pickup bag is.

54:31.050 --> 54:33.226
I can give you
the rest of the cash.

54:34.706 --> 54:36.621
Another 420 grand!

54:37.404 --> 54:38.666
Whoo!

54:38.840 --> 54:40.538
Now we're cooking with gas!

54:40.712 --> 54:42.714
And what of this talk
of your pickup?

54:42.888 --> 54:45.543
I can't give you the pickup!You can't?

54:45.717 --> 54:46.935
If I don't go back
with the pickup,

54:47.109 --> 54:48.154
then my li--

54:49.677 --> 54:52.027
my family's life...

54:53.464 --> 54:55.161
it won't be worth a thing.

54:55.335 --> 54:57.337
Well, your life
isn't worth much right now.

54:59.426 --> 55:03.038
I'm sorry.
That sounded cynical.

55:05.302 --> 55:08.087
So we making a deal or what?

55:08.261 --> 55:10.698
Tell me where it is.I'll go get it.

55:10.872 --> 55:12.309
Hmm.

55:12.483 --> 55:16.530
Because the cash
and this other bag

55:16.704 --> 55:18.445
are in the same spot, huh?

55:19.751 --> 55:21.405
And I gotta guess,
whatever it is,

55:21.579 --> 55:23.320
it's worth about the same
as the money, right?

55:23.494 --> 55:25.931
It was a trade, correct?

55:27.019 --> 55:29.587
Just give me ten minutes
to go get it.

55:29.761 --> 55:33.982
I can trust you
and maybe get half the wealth.

55:34.156 --> 55:36.550
Or I could torture you
and get it all.

55:36.724 --> 55:39.597
Hmm, I think I'll go with B,

55:39.771 --> 55:41.338
torture, all.

55:42.208 --> 55:43.514
[groans]

55:51.739 --> 55:53.828
It's a matter of time, Ray!

56:03.621 --> 56:05.318
Got you, motherfucker.

56:12.325 --> 56:15.154
Ugh!I see it now,

56:15.328 --> 56:18.549
the Yosemite Sam resemblance,
uncanny.

56:18.723 --> 56:21.116
You fucking poisoned me?Maybe.

56:22.074 --> 56:23.945
Gambling it works
on people, but...

56:24.119 --> 56:25.382
[groans]

56:26.992 --> 56:28.254
You're dead!

56:28.428 --> 56:29.777
I'm not sure
you got the time, bud!

56:29.951 --> 56:31.344
I'll fucking kill you, man!

56:31.518 --> 56:35.174
[gagging, spitting]

56:37.089 --> 56:38.395
You're dead!

56:40.440 --> 56:42.399
I'll fucking kill you
and your girl!

56:47.404 --> 56:49.493
Okay. Where's the gun?

56:49.667 --> 56:52.060
[Billings retching]

57:17.956 --> 57:19.784
[handle rattling]

57:19.958 --> 57:21.394
[grunts]

58:19.800 --> 58:21.149
[Billings]
Goddamn it, Ray!

58:32.683 --> 58:34.336
[chain jangles]

58:38.819 --> 58:39.864
[grunts]

58:40.038 --> 58:41.692
Oh, my God.
Are you okay--

58:41.866 --> 58:43.432
[screams] Fuck!

58:43.607 --> 58:45.217
[Ray yells
in distance]

58:46.697 --> 58:48.394
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

58:59.013 --> 59:00.754
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

59:00.928 --> 59:02.800
Sure, you will.
You're here to take me.

59:02.974 --> 59:05.585
Take you?
No, I want out of here too.

59:07.456 --> 59:08.719
[Billings] Ray!

59:09.937 --> 59:11.591
He's looking for me.

59:16.640 --> 59:17.945
Okay.

59:22.689 --> 59:24.430
[grunts]

59:26.475 --> 59:29.217
The name's Ray.
What's yours?

59:29.391 --> 59:31.219
What are we, friends?

59:33.221 --> 59:34.745
Common enemy?

59:36.268 --> 59:38.052
Yeah, he did that to you?

59:38.226 --> 59:40.707
Some of it. Look.

59:40.881 --> 59:43.971
I got a woman
and her kid waiting for me.

59:45.712 --> 59:47.801
The thought of not
seeing them again hurts
more than any of this.

59:47.975 --> 59:52.153
So you'd better believe
I'm getting out of this
hell hole and back to them.

59:52.327 --> 59:54.765
Okay? Okay.

59:54.939 --> 59:58.290
Tara, I've-- I've been here
five days, I think. Um...

59:59.334 --> 1:00:00.901
He grabbed me off the road.

1:00:06.994 --> 1:00:08.996
What, were you
running away from home?

1:00:09.170 --> 1:00:11.042
I never really had a home
to run away from.

1:00:15.568 --> 1:00:17.265
Well, you know,
you shouldn't hitchhike.

1:00:18.049 --> 1:00:19.354
I didn't.

1:00:20.442 --> 1:00:23.620
Good, because...
you shouldn't.

1:00:25.056 --> 1:00:27.362
Maybe you're about done?Yeah. [clears throat]

1:00:28.059 --> 1:00:29.147
[sign thuds]

1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:36.197
[vehicle approaches outside]

1:00:41.289 --> 1:00:42.639
[horn honks]

1:00:42.813 --> 1:00:44.553
[honking continues]

1:00:44.728 --> 1:00:46.164
Ah, shit!

1:00:46.904 --> 1:00:48.166
I think that's for me.

1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:50.690
He said that he's expecting
a truck to come,

1:00:50.864 --> 1:00:53.171
but I don't know
where it's going.

1:00:56.391 --> 1:01:00.613
Doesn't matter. 'Cause you ain't
never getting on it, all right?

1:01:03.834 --> 1:01:05.052
Come on, come on...

1:01:09.317 --> 1:01:11.189
Any problems?Not a one!

1:01:12.799 --> 1:01:14.714
You're early.Yeah, by, like, two minutes.

1:01:14.888 --> 1:01:16.673
That's right. That's okay.

1:01:16.847 --> 1:01:19.632
You just wait right here.
I'll go get her.

1:01:19.806 --> 1:01:22.722
No, I'd like to see
what I'm picking up
before I pick it up.

1:01:23.636 --> 1:01:25.203
No problem.
You're the expert.

1:01:25.377 --> 1:01:27.727
Come on. Come on in.

1:01:27.901 --> 1:01:29.729
Please don't leave me.

1:01:29.903 --> 1:01:32.993
I'm not gonna leave you,
because we're both
getting out of here.

1:01:33.167 --> 1:01:34.778
[distant chatter]

1:01:34.952 --> 1:01:37.041
But, first--
first, I gotta leave you.

1:01:37.215 --> 1:01:38.695
No! [grunts]

1:01:38.869 --> 1:01:40.522
Shh. Trust me.

1:01:55.624 --> 1:01:58.540
Ah. There she is.
[chuckles]

1:02:05.983 --> 1:02:08.637
Are you okay?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:02:08.812 --> 1:02:10.509
Okay?How much is she worth?

1:02:10.683 --> 1:02:12.424
Well, I'm not gonna
inspect her teeth.

1:02:15.862 --> 1:02:16.863
It's okay.

1:02:17.777 --> 1:02:19.300
Bring her upstairs.

1:02:22.173 --> 1:02:25.132
Come on. Come on.

1:03:06.957 --> 1:03:08.785
When you load her, lock her up.

1:03:09.873 --> 1:03:11.613
And hurry up.
I got a long drive.

1:03:12.223 --> 1:03:13.224
Yes, ma'am.

1:03:15.966 --> 1:03:17.924
Wait, wait. You hear something?

1:03:18.098 --> 1:03:20.100
[rumbling, clattering]

1:03:32.156 --> 1:03:33.766
[hornets buzzing]

1:03:33.940 --> 1:03:36.116
[screaming]

1:03:37.335 --> 1:03:39.076
[groans]

1:03:39.250 --> 1:03:41.992
Get the fuck back!
Get the fuck back! You okay?

1:04:03.056 --> 1:04:04.144
Don't scream.

1:04:04.318 --> 1:04:05.711
[grunts]

1:04:05.885 --> 1:04:07.495
Why did you cover my mouth?

1:04:07.669 --> 1:04:09.802
I thought that would work.
I'm sorry.

1:04:13.153 --> 1:04:15.068
Look.They'll find us by the car.

1:04:15.242 --> 1:04:16.678
And they'll find us
in the desert.

1:04:16.853 --> 1:04:18.332
We need to double back
for the car.

1:04:18.506 --> 1:04:20.508
And then I'm gonna take you
anywhere you wanna go.

1:04:20.682 --> 1:04:21.683
Name it.

1:04:21.858 --> 1:04:23.294
[grunts]

1:04:23.468 --> 1:04:26.123
I've been squatting
over in Slab City.

1:04:26.297 --> 1:04:28.038
I should be okay there.

1:04:29.735 --> 1:04:32.564
Well, we'll worry
about that later.

1:04:33.782 --> 1:04:34.696
Can you run?

1:04:34.871 --> 1:04:36.350
Can you run?No.

1:04:36.524 --> 1:04:38.178
But I am gonna hobble like hell.

1:04:39.179 --> 1:04:40.354
Wait.

1:04:41.268 --> 1:04:42.530
Not just yet.

1:04:46.883 --> 1:04:48.754
I should have told you
about him.

1:04:48.928 --> 1:04:51.191
Very unprofessional of me.

1:04:51.365 --> 1:04:55.195
But don't worry.
Neither of them
can get too far.

1:04:55.979 --> 1:04:57.197
I can fix this.

1:04:57.371 --> 1:04:59.808
Yeah. You've done
a bang-up job so far.

1:04:59.983 --> 1:05:02.637
Hey, they're definitely
in here.

1:05:03.595 --> 1:05:05.162
Lot of reasons
to be careful.

1:05:05.336 --> 1:05:06.728
Look at my face.

1:05:06.903 --> 1:05:09.818
This was supposed to
be fucking simple.

1:05:09.993 --> 1:05:12.082
I wanna get the
fuck out of here.

1:05:16.303 --> 1:05:17.435
Wait. There's blood.

1:05:17.609 --> 1:05:19.437
[metal clanking]

1:05:22.570 --> 1:05:24.921
Just follow my lead.

1:05:31.449 --> 1:05:32.754
Come here.

1:05:34.887 --> 1:05:36.802
Okay, three--

1:05:36.976 --> 1:05:40.197
No! Two, one.

1:05:42.939 --> 1:05:45.202
[gasps and screams]

1:05:48.161 --> 1:05:50.076
[sobbing]

1:05:50.250 --> 1:05:51.643
What is this
doing here?

1:05:51.817 --> 1:05:53.514
He must have moved it.

1:05:53.688 --> 1:05:56.561
I keep some traps
around for protection.

1:05:56.735 --> 1:05:59.651
Oh, my God. Help me.
Can you help me right now?

1:06:00.434 --> 1:06:01.609
[screaming]

1:06:01.783 --> 1:06:03.960
[phone rings]Shh, shh, shh. Hello?

1:06:04.134 --> 1:06:06.092
Doctor here.Dr. Topaz?

1:06:06.266 --> 1:06:07.702
[woman] Help me![Billings] Speaking.

1:06:07.876 --> 1:06:09.226
Hi. It's Faith Dryer.
I'm calling about--

1:06:09.400 --> 1:06:12.316
Ray, yes, yes.
Well, it's a pleasure

1:06:12.490 --> 1:06:14.405
to hear from you again,
Ms. Dryer.

1:06:14.579 --> 1:06:16.755
[woman screaming
through phone]

1:06:16.929 --> 1:06:18.626
Sorry, what was that
in the background?

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:21.238
[woman] Oh, my God!Hold one moment, please?

1:06:21.412 --> 1:06:23.370
[woman] Oh, my God.
Help me, fucking idiot.

1:06:27.331 --> 1:06:29.072
[Billings]
I'm back.[chuckles]

1:06:29.246 --> 1:06:31.204
Can you hear me now? Yes, thank you.

1:06:31.378 --> 1:06:32.684
How's Ray?

1:06:32.858 --> 1:06:34.773
[Billings sighs]
I have to admit,

1:06:34.947 --> 1:06:37.341
he's doing much better
than I expected.

1:06:37.515 --> 1:06:38.820
The guy won't quit.

1:06:40.909 --> 1:06:42.520
Do you have your ETA?

1:06:42.694 --> 1:06:44.130
Uh, we are about...

1:06:44.304 --> 1:06:46.915
30 minutes away.We?

1:06:47.090 --> 1:06:50.180
Yeah, my son.
I couldn't get a sitter.

1:06:50.354 --> 1:06:52.399
No problem whatsoever.
I'll tell you what.

1:06:52.573 --> 1:06:54.836
I will send a security guard
to meet you.

1:06:55.011 --> 1:06:56.795
He's a burly man with a beard.

1:06:56.969 --> 1:06:59.232
Okay, thank you.

1:07:04.107 --> 1:07:06.500
You good?Okay, yeah, yeah. Go!

1:07:11.201 --> 1:07:13.812
Oh! Fuck this. Stand back.

1:07:25.737 --> 1:07:27.086
[tires screech]

1:07:39.838 --> 1:07:41.274
[beep][car lock chirps]

1:07:41.448 --> 1:07:43.668
No, no, no, no!

1:07:43.842 --> 1:07:46.149
Remote shut-off. Shit! Shit!

1:07:46.323 --> 1:07:48.107
He told me this wasn't his car!

1:07:51.806 --> 1:07:53.634
[fires shot]

1:07:55.854 --> 1:07:58.639
[fires shot]Go! Just run! Just run!

1:08:02.165 --> 1:08:03.601
[fires shot]

1:08:10.564 --> 1:08:12.305
Go, go! Go, Tara.

1:08:12.479 --> 1:08:15.569
Go, go, go, go, go! Run! Run!

1:08:15.743 --> 1:08:17.615
Run, Tara, run!

1:08:17.789 --> 1:08:18.833
[gunshot]

1:08:19.007 --> 1:08:19.921
[Ray] No!

1:08:20.096 --> 1:08:22.054
Still got it.

1:08:26.624 --> 1:08:28.321
I don't feel like fighting you.

1:08:28.495 --> 1:08:31.150
Best believe
I feel like killing you!

1:08:32.456 --> 1:08:33.718
[gunshot]

1:08:33.892 --> 1:08:35.763
Fuck!

1:08:41.247 --> 1:08:43.902
For the love of God, Montresor!

1:08:44.076 --> 1:08:46.557
You gotta start
thinking about your woman.

1:08:48.646 --> 1:08:49.864
Think about Faith.

1:08:50.735 --> 1:08:52.867
[thudding]Oh...

1:08:53.041 --> 1:08:54.739
And that kid that's with her.

1:08:57.437 --> 1:08:59.613
Yeah, son.

1:08:59.787 --> 1:09:03.878
They'll both be here
in, say, 20 minutes?

1:09:05.793 --> 1:09:07.099
Faith's smart!

1:09:08.361 --> 1:09:10.407
She's not gonna just
walk into your place!

1:09:11.408 --> 1:09:13.192
You mean like you did?

1:09:13.366 --> 1:09:15.107
[laughs]

1:09:15.281 --> 1:09:17.588
Yeah, I mean,
you're probably right.

1:09:17.762 --> 1:09:19.677
That's why I'm gonna meet her
at the access road.

1:09:20.939 --> 1:09:24.725
I'm sorry, meet "them"
at the access road.

1:09:31.558 --> 1:09:33.299
If I tell you
where the bags are...

1:09:33.473 --> 1:09:35.823
When you tell me
where the bags are....will you let 'em go?

1:09:35.997 --> 1:09:37.782
Will you trust my answer?

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.437
I can be less cynical.

1:09:44.354 --> 1:09:46.486
I probably don't even
have time to kill 'em.

1:09:47.705 --> 1:09:50.055
All this death here,
people are gonna come looking.

1:09:50.969 --> 1:09:52.579
I need a head start.

1:09:53.624 --> 1:09:55.539
This money gets me far
and away.

1:10:02.937 --> 1:10:05.462
[voice breaking]
Rusted car husk at the speedway.

1:10:05.636 --> 1:10:07.290
[laughing]

1:10:07.464 --> 1:10:08.682
I put it under the hood.

1:10:08.856 --> 1:10:10.467
[whooping]

1:10:10.641 --> 1:10:12.382
Yeah!

1:10:13.905 --> 1:10:15.863
$440,000?

1:10:16.037 --> 1:10:18.692
420 now. You already got 20.

1:10:20.041 --> 1:10:21.434
All right, then.

1:10:25.003 --> 1:10:26.134
[beeps][car lock chirps]

1:10:47.808 --> 1:10:49.810
[car drives off]

1:10:52.378 --> 1:10:53.640
Fuck!

1:11:20.145 --> 1:11:22.016
[chuckles]

1:11:23.496 --> 1:11:25.281
[box clatters]

1:11:50.654 --> 1:11:51.698
Action time.

1:11:51.872 --> 1:11:54.527
[grunting]

1:12:01.012 --> 1:12:02.883
[engine starts]

[reversing alarm beeps]

1:12:22.729 --> 1:12:23.861
[engine shuts off]

1:12:36.177 --> 1:12:37.657
Oh, shit.

1:12:45.622 --> 1:12:47.188
Oh, shit.

1:12:47.363 --> 1:12:49.756
Door's coming off!Oh, shit!

1:12:54.631 --> 1:12:56.241
Check and mate.

1:13:08.906 --> 1:13:10.168
[groans]

1:13:18.350 --> 1:13:20.091
[grunts][groans]

1:13:20.265 --> 1:13:21.745
[laughs]

1:13:23.137 --> 1:13:24.574
Any last words?

1:13:26.184 --> 1:13:27.185
I...

1:13:27.359 --> 1:13:28.752
Good enough.

1:13:28.926 --> 1:13:30.406
[whistles]

1:13:36.934 --> 1:13:38.892
Well, there's gotta
be a story here.

1:13:43.767 --> 1:13:45.029
I'm the victim here!

1:13:47.684 --> 1:13:49.642
[Grayson]
I'm just disappointed is all.

1:13:49.816 --> 1:13:53.167
I heard so many clever
things about you, Ray.

1:13:53.341 --> 1:13:56.432
But I guess I get the
backstabbing murder side

1:13:56.606 --> 1:13:58.259
of the old habits,
don't I?

1:13:58.434 --> 1:14:00.697
I already told you.
He killed them.

1:14:00.871 --> 1:14:03.351
He was trying to steal
the money, the pickup.

1:14:03.526 --> 1:14:06.093
Unless you and the twins

1:14:06.267 --> 1:14:08.444
always planned
on double-crossing us.

1:14:09.575 --> 1:14:11.534
Split it with this asshole here

1:14:11.708 --> 1:14:14.145
until greed
got the better of you?

1:14:15.363 --> 1:14:17.583
[lisps]
I'm just an innocent bystander.

1:14:17.757 --> 1:14:20.238
This stranger,
he just came in,

1:14:20.412 --> 1:14:22.632
and he was trying
to threaten me,
and I was just...

1:14:25.591 --> 1:14:27.027
All right.
I'm sorry, sir.

1:14:27.201 --> 1:14:29.203
I'm just gonna cut the shit
and level with you.

1:14:29.377 --> 1:14:31.467
The sharp dresser
is mostly right.

1:14:31.641 --> 1:14:33.207
Me and Ray go way back.

1:14:33.381 --> 1:14:35.645
He called me,
and he said he needed a place

1:14:35.819 --> 1:14:37.516
to stash, and I quote,

1:14:37.690 --> 1:14:40.040
"440,000 buckaroonies."

1:14:41.259 --> 1:14:43.000
But then he killed that man,

1:14:43.174 --> 1:14:45.916
and since then,
I've just been trying
to survive.

1:14:49.789 --> 1:14:53.489
Oh, I'm sorry.
I started to tune out
at "buckaroonies."

1:14:55.316 --> 1:14:58.406
You know, before
you get too chummy
with this fucking guy,

1:14:58.581 --> 1:15:03.107
you should know that
he is a dirty, murdering,
fucking child trafficker!

1:15:06.719 --> 1:15:09.940
If you survive this,
we'll talk.

1:15:13.378 --> 1:15:16.642
Oh, so you're
a piece of shit too.

1:15:18.426 --> 1:15:19.906
The world changed.

1:15:23.519 --> 1:15:24.824
It's under the hood.

1:15:27.566 --> 1:15:28.698
Really?

1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:31.265
Go look.

1:15:34.312 --> 1:15:35.966
Well, I expected more
out of you.

1:15:37.794 --> 1:15:39.796
You worked for the Shoemaker.

1:15:39.970 --> 1:15:42.755
Thought you'd learn
how to hide money and things.

1:15:42.929 --> 1:15:45.497
Maybe some of it
would've rubbed off on you.

1:15:45.671 --> 1:15:47.847
Yeah, well,
I'm sorry to disappoint.

1:15:49.675 --> 1:15:51.024
Frankie, the package!

1:15:51.198 --> 1:15:52.635
Give it, here. Here, here.

1:15:52.809 --> 1:15:54.898
Where's the cash?[Ray] You have it.

1:15:55.072 --> 1:15:57.161
I don't have it.Yes, you do.

1:15:57.335 --> 1:15:59.337
I don't have it!Yes, you do!

1:15:59.511 --> 1:16:02.296
You have it!Shut up, both of you!

1:16:02.470 --> 1:16:04.298
First things first!

1:16:04.472 --> 1:16:05.909
Gorgeous.

1:16:06.083 --> 1:16:07.737
That's it?This is it!

1:16:07.911 --> 1:16:08.825
Really?

1:16:08.999 --> 1:16:10.566
Fucking move.

1:16:10.740 --> 1:16:12.132
[Grayson]
Yes, yes...

1:16:12.306 --> 1:16:13.830
Yes! [laughing]

1:16:14.004 --> 1:16:16.006
Yeah. This is it!

1:16:18.138 --> 1:16:19.444
This proves it!

1:16:20.401 --> 1:16:22.273
The Mandela Effect is real!

1:16:22.447 --> 1:16:23.840
It's real?

1:16:24.014 --> 1:16:27.104
The world has changed,
and it's not our fault.

1:16:29.019 --> 1:16:30.803
You're all witnesses to it.

1:16:32.500 --> 1:16:36.461
I give this gift...
to all mankind.

1:16:37.114 --> 1:16:38.811
[laughing]

1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:42.902
Get the VCR.

1:16:55.132 --> 1:16:57.221
[VCR whirring]

1:16:57.395 --> 1:16:59.615
[triumphant movie
soundtrack plays]

1:17:01.921 --> 1:17:04.968
[man roars]

1:17:05.142 --> 1:17:08.058
[Spanish dubbed dialogue]

1:17:08.972 --> 1:17:10.321
Yeah, I've seen this.

1:17:11.235 --> 1:17:13.890
This is...
This is Kazaam.

1:17:14.064 --> 1:17:15.674
You actually bought
four copies of Kazaam.

1:17:15.848 --> 1:17:17.720
Shazaam.No, Kazaam.

1:17:17.894 --> 1:17:19.417
Kazaam.They're
both genie movies.

1:17:19.591 --> 1:17:21.245
But this one is
the Shaquille O'Neal vehicle.

1:17:21.419 --> 1:17:23.900
It's Shazaam.That's a good
Photoshop, though.

1:17:25.597 --> 1:17:30.471
[Spanish dub continues]

1:17:33.997 --> 1:17:36.042
Why does she want this?
What the hell?

1:17:36.869 --> 1:17:39.350
$440,000 for this?

1:17:41.091 --> 1:17:43.180
Yo soy Kazaam!

1:17:44.181 --> 1:17:46.009
[boy on screen yells]

1:17:49.752 --> 1:17:51.928
Oh, she
got you.

1:17:53.233 --> 1:17:57.542
What a waste
of 440,000
buckaroonies.

1:17:57.716 --> 1:17:59.762
But Shaq's
really grounded
in this scene.

1:17:59.936 --> 1:18:01.502
He's so
much better
than LeBron.

1:18:01.677 --> 1:18:03.896
Plus, he's got
all these commercials--Shut up.

1:18:07.204 --> 1:18:09.075
[Grayson]
It's just depressing is all.

1:18:10.337 --> 1:18:11.817
I thought this would prove it.

1:18:13.950 --> 1:18:15.734
Why is the world
so crazy?

1:18:17.170 --> 1:18:18.519
I mean,
it's poisoned.

1:18:18.694 --> 1:18:21.087
It's... toxic.

1:18:21.261 --> 1:18:22.872
And there's nothing
to be done.

1:18:25.091 --> 1:18:26.527
Fucking sucks.

1:18:27.833 --> 1:18:30.662
I guess
it's on us.

1:18:30.836 --> 1:18:35.319
I mean, it'd be easier
if we can blame the universe
changing or time travelers.

1:18:35.493 --> 1:18:38.844
But maybe everything right now
is our own damn fault.

1:18:39.018 --> 1:18:40.846
Just shut the fuck up.
Get behind the wheel

1:18:41.020 --> 1:18:42.413
or I'll put you
behind the car.

1:18:42.587 --> 1:18:43.849
Get out of here.

1:18:44.981 --> 1:18:47.026
Hey! What was that for?

1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:48.375
All right.

1:18:49.899 --> 1:18:51.727
Tapes are gone.
They're worthless.

1:18:53.424 --> 1:18:55.426
Might as well get
my money back.

1:18:55.600 --> 1:18:58.168
Where is it?I'll tell you what happened.

1:18:59.038 --> 1:19:01.649
Your brother
double-crossed you.

1:19:01.824 --> 1:19:05.088
He and the twins were gonna
steal everything and kill Perry,

1:19:05.262 --> 1:19:08.004
but I got sent instead.Bullshit.

1:19:08.178 --> 1:19:10.746
Frankie, the guy's
a professional liar.

1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:14.358
All they had to do
was make it look
like I'd run off.

1:19:14.532 --> 1:19:17.709
There was a time
that would have been easier.
All I did was run.

1:19:19.102 --> 1:19:21.495
Even if it was true,
which it isn't,

1:19:21.669 --> 1:19:23.933
he'd still know
where the money is, right?

1:19:30.548 --> 1:19:32.245
Where's the money?

1:19:32.419 --> 1:19:35.248
It's in that car,
last I saw it.

1:19:37.337 --> 1:19:38.425
[whistles]

1:19:42.647 --> 1:19:44.867
[grunting]

1:19:52.135 --> 1:19:53.136
Oh, shit!

1:20:07.063 --> 1:20:08.934
All right.
I'm calling the Shoemaker.

1:20:09.108 --> 1:20:12.111
Maybe your death
will be a peace offering,

1:20:12.285 --> 1:20:14.592
you and your friend
in prison.

1:20:14.766 --> 1:20:18.944
The only person I told
is Billings.

1:20:19.118 --> 1:20:22.165
Hey! Don't you
put that on me, bro!

1:20:22.339 --> 1:20:24.123
I'd be long gone
if I had the money!

1:20:25.298 --> 1:20:27.083
[whistles]Oh, Shit.

1:20:43.926 --> 1:20:46.580
You stand,
you die.

1:20:49.627 --> 1:20:52.499
[grunting]

1:20:52.673 --> 1:20:55.502
[phone ringing]

1:21:11.388 --> 1:21:13.999
[ringing continues]

1:21:23.008 --> 1:21:24.314
[grunting]

1:21:26.751 --> 1:21:28.405
Somebody wants
to talk to you.

1:21:32.235 --> 1:21:34.193
What's the matter, Ray?
You don't wanna talk?

1:21:42.810 --> 1:21:46.423
All right. On my signal,
take him around again.

1:21:46.597 --> 1:21:49.426
Only twice as long
and twice as fast.

1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:50.949
[vehicle approaching]

1:21:53.996 --> 1:21:56.824
She must have overheard me
and Ray! Beat us to it!

1:22:05.703 --> 1:22:08.010
She's got the cash!
Chase her down!

1:22:10.708 --> 1:22:12.753
[coughing, laughing]

1:22:13.754 --> 1:22:14.973
Is that true?

1:22:16.453 --> 1:22:17.628
She's got the cash?

1:22:17.802 --> 1:22:19.021
Your brother...

1:22:20.457 --> 1:22:22.981
asked when you were
gonna see the old me.

1:22:23.155 --> 1:22:26.506
Yeah.
You said you were knocking.

1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:27.681
Well, I'm waiting.

1:22:30.641 --> 1:22:32.077
I let him in.

1:22:33.905 --> 1:22:35.646
What?[whistles]

1:22:37.865 --> 1:22:39.998
Perry! Perry!

1:22:40.172 --> 1:22:41.434
Perry, stop!

1:22:44.133 --> 1:22:47.092
Perry, wait!Fucker.

1:22:51.357 --> 1:22:52.619
Oh, f...

1:22:52.793 --> 1:22:53.838
Okay.

1:22:58.408 --> 1:22:59.800
[bones crack]

1:23:11.421 --> 1:23:14.032
[filters popping on]

1:23:33.312 --> 1:23:34.879
Oh, geez. No.

1:23:35.053 --> 1:23:37.751
No, no, no, no, no...

1:23:39.492 --> 1:23:41.973
I'm gonna borrow these firearms.

1:23:44.019 --> 1:23:45.498
Can never have enough.

1:23:56.335 --> 1:23:57.597
[horn honks]

1:24:02.559 --> 1:24:04.952
[vehicle approaching]

1:24:11.089 --> 1:24:12.221
Tara!

1:24:15.746 --> 1:24:17.139
[Tara] I'm fine!

1:24:18.183 --> 1:24:20.011
Find a damn gun!

1:24:22.492 --> 1:24:23.797
Okay.

1:24:24.755 --> 1:24:26.191
Great. More running.

1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:32.067
[grunting]

1:25:03.968 --> 1:25:05.012
One shot.

1:25:06.449 --> 1:25:07.580
[gunshot]

1:25:11.976 --> 1:25:13.020
[gunshot]

1:25:15.719 --> 1:25:18.200
Can you make
your one shot count?

1:25:18.374 --> 1:25:20.332
You're a mess, Ray![gunshot]

1:25:20.506 --> 1:25:22.291
In a few steps...[gunshot]

1:25:22.465 --> 1:25:23.683
I will be in range

1:25:23.857 --> 1:25:25.772
and one of these pistols
will kill you!

1:25:26.338 --> 1:25:28.123
Believe that.

1:25:31.126 --> 1:25:32.779
Oh...

1:25:32.953 --> 1:25:33.998
Okay.

1:25:34.172 --> 1:25:35.521
Okay.

1:25:35.695 --> 1:25:38.307
Okay, I always like
a good Western.

1:25:38.481 --> 1:25:41.440
High Noon, Shane.

1:25:42.267 --> 1:25:43.573
Cowboy Bebop?

1:25:52.016 --> 1:25:53.887
I never saw you
as the anime type.

1:25:56.455 --> 1:25:57.935
You never asked.

1:26:01.939 --> 1:26:03.419
I gotta call range!

1:26:12.079 --> 1:26:12.993
Check and mate--

1:26:13.168 --> 1:26:15.126
[gunshot echoes]

1:26:24.527 --> 1:26:28.008
[Billings roars]

1:26:29.401 --> 1:26:32.448
You-- You--

1:26:32.622 --> 1:26:34.624
[Billings roars]Billings!

1:26:34.798 --> 1:26:36.800
Billings, stop! Stop!

1:26:38.367 --> 1:26:39.585
Ray...

1:26:42.327 --> 1:26:44.111
You're not Yosemite Sam.

1:26:46.201 --> 1:26:47.550
Just grazed me!

1:26:49.421 --> 1:26:51.075
You're Wile E. Coyote.

1:26:53.164 --> 1:26:54.774
[gasps]

1:27:04.219 --> 1:27:05.611
Check and mate.

1:27:12.314 --> 1:27:14.229
Oh, what a fucking day.

1:27:22.237 --> 1:27:23.455
[groans]

1:27:23.629 --> 1:27:24.804
What?

1:27:32.551 --> 1:27:34.336
[vehicle approaching]

1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:38.165
Shit! [screams]

1:27:50.569 --> 1:27:52.571
[phone rings]

1:27:52.745 --> 1:27:54.051
Hello?

1:27:54.225 --> 1:27:55.531
[Ray] Faith!
Are you okay?

1:27:55.705 --> 1:27:58.098
Ray! Are you okay?

1:27:59.926 --> 1:28:02.015
I am now.

1:28:02.189 --> 1:28:05.671
But it's best if you and Julian
just turn around, okay?
Get out of here.

1:28:05.845 --> 1:28:07.630
I'm-- But I'm right here.

1:28:07.804 --> 1:28:10.197
And I want to be with you
more than anything.

1:28:10.372 --> 1:28:13.723
But trust me.
I will explain everything
when I see you in a few hours.

1:28:14.419 --> 1:28:16.291
Everything.

1:28:16.465 --> 1:28:18.510
Even the things
that I wanted to forget.

1:28:19.294 --> 1:28:20.599
Echoes from my past.

1:28:23.820 --> 1:28:25.691
I'm so sorry.

1:28:25.865 --> 1:28:29.260
Sorry that even
a whisper of them
came close to you and Julian.

1:28:32.089 --> 1:28:33.917
But I'll never
let that happen again.

1:28:35.701 --> 1:28:36.920
It's all behind me.

1:28:42.447 --> 1:28:45.885
Hey, remember when you said,
with Julian,
I was halfway there?

1:28:46.059 --> 1:28:47.452
Yeah.

1:28:47.626 --> 1:28:49.585
I think I just picked up
the other half.

1:28:52.936 --> 1:28:54.024
A kid I found.

1:28:56.243 --> 1:28:57.506
She needs what I need.

1:29:02.206 --> 1:29:03.947
She needs it
just as much as I do.

1:29:07.690 --> 1:29:09.344
What is it that you need?

1:29:10.649 --> 1:29:11.824
I just need...

1:29:13.957 --> 1:29:15.088
to get...

1:29:20.877 --> 1:29:22.531
home.

1:30:30.990 --> 1:30:32.688
Just like
you thought.

1:30:35.038 --> 1:30:37.475
Shoemaker always was
good at hiding things.

1:30:39.738 --> 1:30:41.087
[Ray] We should
get rid of this.

1:30:42.872 --> 1:30:44.221
It's nothing
but trouble.

1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:47.616
That's not me anymore.[snickers]
