00:33.950 --> 00:39.413
There's a bunch of birds in the sky

00:39.914 --> 00:45.502
And some deers just went running by

00:45.587 --> 00:48.630
Oh, the snow's pure and white

00:48.715 --> 00:53.260
On the earth, rich and brown

00:53.344 --> 00:56.513
Just another Sunday morning

00:56.598 --> 01:01.894
In my quiet mountain town

01:05.065 --> 01:07.441
The sun is shining
and the grass is green

01:07.525 --> 01:09.735
Under the three feet of snow, I mean

01:09.819 --> 01:13.238
This is the day
when it's hard to wear a frown

01:13.323 --> 01:15.491
All the happy people stop to say hello

01:15.575 --> 01:16.575
Get out of my way!

01:16.659 --> 01:18.452
Even though the temperature's low

01:18.536 --> 01:23.290
It's a perfect Sunday morning
in my quiet little mountain town

01:23.374 --> 01:24.750
Well, good morning, Stan.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.211
- Mom, can I have $8 to see a movie?
- A movie?

01:27.295 --> 01:30.130
Yeah, it's gonna be the best movie ever!
It's a foreign film from Canada!

01:30.215 --> 01:31.340
All right, here you go.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.051
- But be back for supper.
- Thanks, Mom.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.428
Oh, what a picture-perfect child

01:36.513 --> 01:38.764
Just like Jesus, he's tender and mild

01:38.848 --> 01:42.351
He'd wear a smile
while he wore a thorny crown

01:42.435 --> 01:45.145
What an angel
with a heart so sweet and sure

01:45.230 --> 01:47.397
And a mind so open and pure

01:47.482 --> 01:51.860
Thank God we live in this quiet
redneck mountain town

01:52.237 --> 01:54.238
Dude! Dude, wake up!

01:57.200 --> 01:58.867
Kenny, come on!

02:00.036 --> 02:02.454
Kenny, the Terrance and Phillip
movie is out. You wanna come?

02:04.207 --> 02:06.583
Where do you think you're going?

02:07.043 --> 02:09.586
You can't! You have to go to church!

02:10.463 --> 02:12.714
Well, fine,
you go ahead and miss church!

02:12.799 --> 02:16.927
And then when you die and go to hell,
you can answer to Satan!

02:18.096 --> 02:20.389
You can see your breath
hanging in the air

02:20.473 --> 02:22.474
You see homeless people
but you just don't care

02:22.559 --> 02:26.395
It's a sea of smiles
in which we'd be glad to drown

02:30.942 --> 02:32.651
That's right
It's Sunday morning

02:32.735 --> 02:36.989
In our quiet little white-bread
redneck mountain town

02:38.533 --> 02:41.243
- Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
- Don't kick the baby.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.911
Kick the baby.

02:43.746 --> 02:48.667
Ike, you broke another window!
That's a bad baby! Bad baby!

02:48.751 --> 02:51.378
Kyle, we're going to
the Terrance and Phillip movie!

02:51.462 --> 02:52.546
Oh, my God, dude!

02:52.630 --> 02:55.507
- Kyle, where are you going?
- We're going ice skating.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.342
Well, take your little brother
out with you.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.469
Oh, Mom. He's not even my real brother.
He's adopted!

02:59.554 --> 03:00.762
Do as I say, Kyle!

03:00.847 --> 03:02.723
Okay! Okay! I'm sorry!

03:04.267 --> 03:08.604
Look at those frail and fragile boys
It really gets me down

03:08.688 --> 03:13.025
The world is such a rotten place
and city life's a complete disgrace

03:13.109 --> 03:15.527
That's why I moved
to this redneck, meshugana

03:15.612 --> 03:21.158
Quiet mountain town

03:21.242 --> 03:23.452
Ike! Bad baby!

03:23.703 --> 03:25.704
This program is brought to you
by Snacky Smores,

03:25.788 --> 03:27.873
the creamy fun of smores
in a delightful cookie crunch.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.708
Mom! Somebody's at the door!

03:29.792 --> 03:32.169
- Coming, hon.
- I can't see the TV!

03:32.253 --> 03:34.421
It's been six weeks since
Saddam Hussein was killed

03:34.505 --> 03:35.714
by a pack of wild boars

03:35.798 --> 03:37.591
and the world is still glad
to be rid of him.

03:37.675 --> 03:40.469
- Look, Eric, it's your little friends.
- Spider-Man!

03:40.553 --> 03:42.763
What are you guys doing here?

03:42.847 --> 03:45.641
Sweet, dude! Yes! Yes!

03:45.725 --> 03:48.560
Off to the movies we shall go

03:48.645 --> 03:51.230
Where we learn everything
that we know

03:51.314 --> 03:55.317
'Cause the movies teach us
what our parents don't have time to say

03:55.401 --> 03:58.237
And this movie's gonna make
our lives complete

03:58.321 --> 04:00.530
'Cause Terrance and Phillip
are sweet

04:00.615 --> 04:01.615
Super sweet.

04:01.699 --> 04:06.495
Thank God we live in the quiet
little redneck, Podunk, white-trash

04:06.579 --> 04:11.291
U.S.A.

04:11.376 --> 04:15.003
Can I have five tickets to
Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.129
No.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.091
What do you mean, no?

04:19.175 --> 04:21.301
Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire
has been rated R

04:21.386 --> 04:23.303
by the Motion Picture
Association ofAmerica.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.389
You have to be accompanied
by a parent or guardian.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.765
- But why?
- Because this movie

04:26.849 --> 04:27.849
has naughty language!

04:27.934 --> 04:29.559
Next, please.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.230
- This can't be happening!
- We have to see this movie, dude!

04:33.314 --> 04:35.107
Screw it!
It probably isn't all that good anyway.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.484
Cartman, what are you talking about?
You love Terrance and Phillip!

04:37.568 --> 04:40.237
Yeah, but the animations all crappy.

04:41.864 --> 04:43.407
Wait, I've got an idea!

04:44.617 --> 04:47.119
Hi, I want six tickets to Asses of Fire.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.579
This movie might not be
appropriate for your little ones.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.873
Hey, he says this movie
isn't appropriate for you.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.959
Look, Mr. Homeless Guy,
if you don't wanna buy us tickets

04:54.043 --> 04:56.295
and not get your 10 bucks and
not go buy yourself a bottle of vodka,

04:56.379 --> 04:57.379
then be my guest.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.256
Six tickets, please.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.761
- Let me have some candy, Cartman.
- Let's see.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.388
Nope, I don't have any Jewish candy.

05:06.472 --> 05:09.516
Like you really need all that
chocolate, fat boy!

05:09.600 --> 05:11.476
The movie's starting.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.315
Hooray!

05:16.399 --> 05:18.358
Say, Terrance,
what did the Spanish priest

05:18.443 --> 05:20.277
say to the Iranian gynecologist?

05:20.361 --> 05:22.529
I don't know, Phillip. What?

05:24.574 --> 05:26.158
Where do they come up with this stuff?

05:26.242 --> 05:28.869
You're such a pig fucker, Phillip!

05:28.953 --> 05:29.995
What did he say?

05:30.079 --> 05:32.414
Terrance,
why would you call me a pig fucker?

05:32.498 --> 05:35.292
Let's see. First of all, you fuck pigs.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.752
Oh, yeah!

05:37.211 --> 05:39.921
Yeah. Fuck my ass and call me a bitch!

05:41.090 --> 05:43.467
- You shit-faced cockmaster!
- Wow!

05:43.801 --> 05:45.427
"Shit-faced cockmaster."

05:45.511 --> 05:47.179
Listen, you donkey-raping shit-eater!

05:47.263 --> 05:49.348
"Donkey-raping shit-eater."

05:50.516 --> 05:53.769
- You'd fuck your uncle.
- You'd fuck your uncle!

05:54.270 --> 05:56.605
Shut your fucking face, uncle fucka

05:56.689 --> 05:59.441
You're a cock-sucking, ass-licking
uncle fucka

05:59.525 --> 06:02.527
You're an uncle fucka, yes, it's true
Nobody fucks uncles quite like you

06:02.612 --> 06:05.030
Shut your fucking face, uncle fucka

06:05.114 --> 06:07.991
You're the one that fucked your uncle
Uncle fucka

06:08.076 --> 06:12.704
You don't eat or sleep or mow the lawn
You just fuck your uncle all day long

06:22.840 --> 06:24.800
What's going on here?

06:26.969 --> 06:28.095
What garbage.

06:28.179 --> 06:31.098
Well, what do you expect?
They're Canadian.

06:33.851 --> 06:38.397
Uncle fucka! Uncle fucka!
Uncle fucka!

06:39.524 --> 06:41.817
Shut your fucking face, uncle fucka

06:41.901 --> 06:44.611
You're a boner-biting bastard
Uncle fucka

06:44.695 --> 06:46.196
You're an uncle fucka, I must say

06:46.280 --> 06:48.198
You fucked your uncle yesterday

06:48.282 --> 06:49.491
Uncle fucka

06:49.575 --> 06:51.785
That's U-N-C-L-E

06:51.869 --> 06:54.621
Fuck you, uncle fucka!

06:54.705 --> 06:55.747
Suck my balls.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.254
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!

07:02.338 --> 07:04.089
You bet your fucking ass it was!

07:04.173 --> 07:05.924
Fuck, dude, I wanna be
just like Terrance and Phillip.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.427
Hey, wait a minute!
Where's your guardian?

07:08.511 --> 07:12.305
I knew it! You paid a homeless guy
to get you in, didn't you?

07:12.890 --> 07:16.059
- Fuck off, you donkey-raping shit-eater!
- Yeah!

07:16.144 --> 07:18.270
Shut your fucking face, uncle fucka

07:18.354 --> 07:21.022
You're an ass-licking, ball-sucking
uncle fucka

07:30.032 --> 07:31.867
Hey, where have you guys been all day?

07:31.951 --> 07:35.912
Nowhere. We just went to go see
the Terrance and Phillip movie.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.414
- You saw it?
- How'd you get in?

07:37.498 --> 07:40.375
Hey, stop crowding us,
you shit-faced cockmasters!

07:40.460 --> 07:41.626
Wow.

07:41.711 --> 07:45.172
Yeah. You're all a bunch of
ass-ramming uncle fuckers.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.132
We have got to see this movie, dude.

07:47.216 --> 07:50.802
Terrance and Phillip are Canadian,
just like my brother.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.806
There's the girl that I like

07:54.891 --> 07:56.975
Hey, Stan, tell them about
when Terrance called Phillip

07:57.059 --> 07:58.643
a testicle-shitting rectal wart.

07:58.728 --> 08:02.105
Now more than ever
she gives me butterfiies

08:02.190 --> 08:05.859
It makes my stomach queasy
every time she walks by

08:05.943 --> 08:07.569
Asshole, I'm talking to you.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.780
I know I can be cool if I try

08:11.240 --> 08:12.574
Hi, Stan.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.075
Gross!

08:14.994 --> 08:17.829
Come, Wendy.
Let us try to jump the hilly brush.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.831
- Who are you, kid?
- My name is Gregory.

08:19.916 --> 08:23.210
I just transferred from Yardale,
where I had a 4.0 grade point average.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.544
Wanna skate with us?

08:24.629 --> 08:25.670
We've been skating all morning

08:25.755 --> 08:28.632
and laughing
and talking of memories past.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.717
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.761
Try and catch me, Wendy.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.097
Bye, Stan.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.852
Yes, yes,
I saw the Terrance and Phillip movie.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.855
Who wants to touch me?

08:43.940 --> 08:46.608
I said who wants to fucking touch me?

08:47.777 --> 08:51.947
Come on, gang! We've gotta see
the Terrance and Phillip movie, too!

08:54.075 --> 08:55.825
I hate you, Kenny.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.916
Shut your fucking face, uncle fucka

09:03.000 --> 09:06.127
You're a boner-biting bastard
Uncle fucka...

09:06.671 --> 09:10.924
Okay, children, let's take our seats.
We have a lot to learn today.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.301
We sure do, Mr. Hat.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.721
Okay, children. Let's start the day
with a few new math problems.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.723
What is five times two?

09:20.226 --> 09:23.770
Come on, children. Don't be shy.
Just give it your best shot.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.397
- Yes, Clyde?
- Twelve?

09:25.481 --> 09:27.232
Okay. Now let's try to get an answer

09:27.316 --> 09:29.568
from someone
who's not a complete retard.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.987
Anyone? Come on, don't be shy.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.573
I think I know the answer, Mr. Garrison.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.450
- Shut up, fat boy!
- Hey! Don't call me fat, you fucking Jew!

09:37.535 --> 09:39.661
Eric, did you just say the "F" word?

09:40.121 --> 09:41.705
- Jew?
- No. He's talking about "fuck."

09:41.789 --> 09:43.415
You can't say "fuck" in school,
you fucking fat-ass!

09:43.499 --> 09:44.958
- Kyle!
- Why the fuck not?

09:45.042 --> 09:46.751
- Eric!
- Dude, you just said "fuck" again!

09:46.836 --> 09:48.044
Stanley!

09:48.129 --> 09:49.379
- Kenny!
- What's the big deal?

09:49.463 --> 09:51.590
It doesn't hurt anybody.
Fuck, fuckity, fuck, fuck, fuck.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.134
How would you like to go
see the school counselor?

09:54.218 --> 09:56.845
How would you like to suck my balls?

09:57.513 --> 09:59.139
What did you say?

09:59.223 --> 10:02.517
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Actually, what I said was...

10:03.269 --> 10:07.647
How would you like to suck my balls,
Mr. Garrison?

10:08.941 --> 10:10.066
Holy shit, dude.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.989
Well, I must say, I'm very disappointed
in you boys, m'kay?

10:16.073 --> 10:17.699
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.284
And I've already called in
your mothers...

10:19.368 --> 10:21.119
- You called my mom?
- That's right.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.830
- Oh, no, dude!
- Mr. Mackey, can I ask a question?

10:23.914 --> 10:24.956
M'kay. What?

10:25.041 --> 10:27.459
- What's the big fucking deal, bitch?
- Yeah.

10:27.543 --> 10:31.129
Now I wanna know where you heard
these horrific obscenities, m'kay?

10:31.213 --> 10:32.213
Nowhere.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.215
We heard them from Mr. Garrison
a few times before.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.925
- Yeah.
- Boys, I seriously doubt

10:36.010 --> 10:37.969
that Mr. Garrison ever said,

10:38.054 --> 10:41.056
"Eat penguin shit, you ass spelunker."

10:42.600 --> 10:43.850
Sweet.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.898
Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.483
This just isn't like you, Stanley.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.944
What did my son say, Mr. Mackey?
Did he say the "S" word?

10:55.029 --> 10:57.697
- No, it was worse than that.
- The "F" word?

10:57.782 --> 11:01.326
Well, here's a short list of the things
they've been saying, m'kay?

11:01.410 --> 11:04.329
- Dear God!
- What the heck is a rim job?

11:04.413 --> 11:06.164
Why that's when you put your legs
behind your head

11:06.248 --> 11:08.583
and have someone lick your ass.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.671
Young man, you will tell
Mr. Mackey this instant

11:12.755 --> 11:14.506
where you heard
all these horrible phrases!

11:14.590 --> 11:15.715
I... I...

11:15.800 --> 11:17.175
We can't tell you.
We all took a sacred oath

11:17.259 --> 11:18.343
and swore ourselves to secrecy.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.011
- It was the Terrance and Phillip movie.
- Dude!

11:20.096 --> 11:21.846
What? Fuck you guys!
I wanna get out of here!

11:21.931 --> 11:24.015
Terrance and Phillip?
Those Canadians?

11:24.100 --> 11:26.184
Excuse me,
what the heck is Terrance and Phillip?

11:26.268 --> 11:29.813
Terrance and Phillip are two very
untalented actors from Canada.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.232
Nothing but foul language
and toilet humor.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.818
Well, I guess I'll have to send
a warning letter out to parents

11:34.902 --> 11:36.861
before more children
see Terrance and Phillip.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.571
- Everybody's fucking seen it!
- Eric!

11:38.656 --> 11:39.906
I'm sorry, I can't help myself.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.075
That movie has warped
my fragile little mind.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.835
There's the girl that I like

11:53.379 --> 11:56.548
Over there laughing
with that smart new...

11:56.632 --> 11:59.384
You're holding up
the goddamn lunch line!

11:59.552 --> 12:01.928
- Hello there, children.
- Hey, Chef.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.346
- How's it going?
- Bad.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.432
- Why bad?
- We got busted for swearing.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.934
Our moms say we can't ever see
the Terrance and Phillip movie again!

12:08.018 --> 12:09.060
That's too bad.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.562
You should've seen Kyle
when his mom showed up.

12:10.646 --> 12:11.980
He was scared out of his mind.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.107
- Shut up, Cartman!
- No, dude. I'd be scared, too.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.233
Your mom's a fucking bitch.

12:15.317 --> 12:16.985
Don't call my mom a bitch, you fat fuck!

12:17.069 --> 12:19.028
Don't call me fat,
you butt-fucking son of a bitch!

12:19.113 --> 12:21.614
Whoa, children,
where did you learn to talk like that?

12:21.699 --> 12:23.241
It's pretty fucking sweet, huh?

12:23.325 --> 12:26.453
Chef, how do you make a woman
like you more than any other guy?

12:26.537 --> 12:27.579
That's easy.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.498
- You just gotta find the clitoris.
- Huh?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.001
What does that mean,
"Find the clitoris"?

12:33.085 --> 12:34.294
Forget I said anything.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.463
Move along, children,
you're holding up the line.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.590
You guys, do you know
where I can find the clitoris?

12:38.674 --> 12:39.716
The what?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.676
What, is that like finding Jesus
or something?

12:41.761 --> 12:42.844
Attention, students.

12:42.928 --> 12:46.139
We are now enforcing a new dress code
at South Park Elementary.

12:46.223 --> 12:49.434
Terrance and Phillip shirts
are no longer allowed in school.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.311
Anyone wearing
a Terrance and Phillip shirt

12:51.395 --> 12:54.063
is to be sent home immediately.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.356
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

12:59.236 --> 13:01.821
The R-rated Canadian film
Asses of Fire

13:01.906 --> 13:03.531
is number one at the box office.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.617
But is the film
destroying American youth?

13:05.701 --> 13:08.077
Here with a special report
is a midget in a bikini.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.580
Thanks, Tom. It appears that the effects

13:10.664 --> 13:12.123
of the Canadian comedy
are far-reaching indeed.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.501
All over America,
children seem to be influenced,

13:14.585 --> 13:16.711
like at this spelling bee in Washington.

13:16.879 --> 13:21.299
All right. This is for the silver medal.
Spell "forensics."

13:21.383 --> 13:23.510
Fuck that! Why should I fucking
have to spell "forensics"?

13:23.594 --> 13:24.677
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:24.762 --> 13:28.765
Here you go. S-U-C-K-M-Y-A-S-S.
Forensics.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.976
Tom, the devastating impact
of the Canadian duo

13:32.061 --> 13:36.189
can also be seen with their new hit song
Shut Your Fucking Face, Uncle Fucka.

13:36.398 --> 13:39.108
Shut your fucking face, uncle fucka

13:39.193 --> 13:42.779
You're a boner-biting bastard
Uncle fucka

13:42.863 --> 13:45.740
Thought I told you that
we won't stop

13:46.450 --> 13:48.326
- Back to you, Tom.
- Thanks, midget.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.369
Shocking report.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.996
The controversy began in the small
mountain town of South Park

13:52.081 --> 13:54.499
where the local PTA
is trying to ban the movie.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.585
With us tonight is the head of the PTA,
Sheila Broflovski.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.171
- Hello, Tom.
- And the Canadian Minister of Movies.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.506
Thanks for having me, buddy.

14:01.590 --> 14:02.799
Minister, parents are concerned

14:02.883 --> 14:04.884
about your country's entertainment.
Your thoughts?

14:04.969 --> 14:07.303
Well, the film is R-rated
and is not intended for children.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.347
But of course children are gonna see it!

14:09.431 --> 14:11.015
Can I finish?
The fact is that we Canadians

14:11.100 --> 14:12.058
are quite surprised by your outrage.

14:12.142 --> 14:15.019
- You just don't care!
- Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish?

14:15.104 --> 14:17.856
The United States has graphic violence
on television all the time.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.023
We can't believe that a movie

14:19.108 --> 14:20.567
with some foul language
would piss you off so much.

14:20.651 --> 14:24.320
- Because it's evil!
- Can I finish? Please! Can I finish?

14:25.281 --> 14:26.406
Okay, I'm finished.

14:26.490 --> 14:28.366
But, Mr. Minister, it isn't like this film

14:28.450 --> 14:30.326
is the first troublesome thing
to come out of Canada.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.995
Let us not forget Bryan Adams.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.663
Now, now. The Canadian government
has apologized

14:33.747 --> 14:35.164
for Bryan Adams on several occasions.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.708
You Canadians are all the same,

14:36.792 --> 14:38.877
with your beady little eyes
and fiapping heads!

14:38.961 --> 14:40.962
- You're trash.
- I resent that! I find that racist!

14:41.046 --> 14:42.630
Our children are now addicted
to your filth!

14:42.715 --> 14:44.382
You are a racist, ma'am.
You are a racist.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.925
It is going to take us weeks

14:46.010 --> 14:49.262
to erase the damage
this film has done to our children!

14:52.349 --> 14:55.727
Kids, I wanna welcome you
to rehabilitation, m'kay?

14:55.811 --> 14:58.897
Your mothers insisted that you be taken
from your normal schoolwork

14:58.981 --> 15:01.482
and placed into rehab
to learn not to swear.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.234
I must say, I don't think I belong
with these rogues.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.029
I attended school at Yardale
and had a 4.0 grade point average.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.405
You're a fucking faggot, dude.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.617
M'kay. You see, children?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.911
We have to get you off of foul language.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.747
- How are we gonna do that?
- Well, listen here.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.750
There are times
when you get suckered in

15:18.834 --> 15:22.295
By drugs and alcohol
and sex with women, m'kay?

15:22.379 --> 15:24.923
But it's when you do these things
too much

15:25.007 --> 15:29.677
That you've become an addict
and must get back in touch

15:30.137 --> 15:33.348
You can do it
It's all up to you, m'kay?

15:33.933 --> 15:37.602
With a little plan
you can change your life today

15:37.686 --> 15:39.979
You don't have to spend your life
addicted to smack

15:40.064 --> 15:42.273
Homeless on the streets
giving hand-jobs for crack

15:42.358 --> 15:45.276
Follow my plan
and very soon you will say

15:45.361 --> 15:47.445
"It's easy, m'kay?"

15:48.572 --> 15:50.281
Step one, instead of "ass" say "buns"

15:50.366 --> 15:52.784
Like "Kiss my buns"
or "You're a buns-hole"

15:52.868 --> 15:54.285
Step two, instead of "shit" say "poo"

15:54.370 --> 15:56.871
As in "bull-poo," "poo-head"
and "This poo is cold"

15:56.956 --> 15:58.498
Step three, with "bitch" drop the "T"

15:58.582 --> 16:01.125
'Cause"bich' is Latin for "generosity"

16:01.210 --> 16:02.627
Step four, don't say "fuck" anymore

16:02.711 --> 16:04.796
'Cause "fuck" is the worst word
that you can say

16:04.880 --> 16:07.173
So just use the word "m'kay"

16:07.257 --> 16:09.801
We can do it
It's all up to us, m'kay?

16:09.885 --> 16:11.052
M'kay

16:11.136 --> 16:13.388
With a little plan
we can change our lives today

16:13.472 --> 16:14.973
You can change it today

16:15.057 --> 16:17.350
You don't have to spend your life
shooting up in the trash

16:17.434 --> 16:19.352
Homeless on the streets
giving hand-jobs for cash

16:19.436 --> 16:22.522
Follow this plan
and very soon you will say

16:22.606 --> 16:24.899
"It's easy, m'kay?"

16:25.776 --> 16:27.485
- Step one
- Instead of "ass" say "buns"

16:27.569 --> 16:29.946
- Like "Kiss my buns"
- Or "You're a buns-hole"

16:30.030 --> 16:31.531
- Step two
- Instead of "shit" say "poo"

16:31.615 --> 16:32.657
- As in "bull-poo"
- "Poo-head"

16:32.741 --> 16:34.075
And "This poo is cold"

16:34.159 --> 16:35.660
- Step three
- With "bitch" drop the "T"

16:35.744 --> 16:38.329
'Cause"bich' is Latin for "generosity"

16:38.414 --> 16:39.831
- Step four
- Don't say "fuck" anymore

16:39.915 --> 16:42.166
'Cause "fuck" is the worse word
that you can say

16:42.251 --> 16:44.127
"Fuck" is the worse word
that you can say

16:44.211 --> 16:46.671
we shouldn't say "fuck"
No, we shouldn't say "fuck," fuck, no!

16:46.755 --> 16:48.089
You're cured, you can go

16:48.173 --> 16:50.425
You don't have to spend your life
shooting up in the trash

16:50.509 --> 16:52.510
Homeless on the streets
giving hand-jobs for cash

16:52.594 --> 16:55.638
Follow this plan
and very soon you will say

16:55.723 --> 16:56.764
"It's easy, m'kay?"

16:56.849 --> 16:57.849
It's easy, m'kay?

16:57.933 --> 17:00.018
- It's easy, m'kay?
- It's easy, m'kay?

17:00.102 --> 17:02.061
- It's easy, m'kay?
- It's easy

17:02.146 --> 17:04.439
It's easy
It's easy, m'kay?

17:05.941 --> 17:08.108
M'kay. M'kay.

17:09.444 --> 17:10.486
Now you're cured.

17:10.570 --> 17:14.406
You can take the rest of the afternoon
off for personal reflection, m'kay?

17:14.491 --> 17:18.118
Find your own constructive way
to better yourself, m'kay?

17:20.204 --> 17:21.748
Well, Phillip,
I hope you've learned something

17:21.832 --> 17:22.874
through this whole experience.

17:22.958 --> 17:27.587
I did, Terrance. I learned that you are
a boner-biting dick-fart fuck-face.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.590
Want to see the northern lights?

17:32.634 --> 17:35.720
You burned yourself to death
by lighting your fart!

17:35.804 --> 17:37.805
I sure did, Phillip.

17:38.474 --> 17:42.060
Uncle fucker! Too tight!

17:46.857 --> 17:49.150
Man, that movie gets better
every time I see it.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.860
- Hey!
- Yeah, but you know what?

17:50.944 --> 17:52.904
That whole part about
lighting farts is bullshit.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.614
You can't do that.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.157
No way!

17:56.825 --> 18:00.661
Okay, Kenny, I'll bet you $100
you can't light a fart on fire!

18:07.002 --> 18:09.337
- Holy shit, dude!
- Oh, my God!

18:10.172 --> 18:12.340
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

18:12.883 --> 18:16.010
- Somebody do something!
- This stick is on fire!

18:21.809 --> 18:24.644
- Oh, my God, you killed Kenny!
- You bastard!

18:24.728 --> 18:27.230
Well, I guess you can light
a fart on fire, huh?

18:30.109 --> 18:32.401
Load that IV with 70 cc's of
sodium pentothal!

18:32.486 --> 18:34.487
- We just called the parents.
- Oh, shit, dude!

18:34.571 --> 18:35.696
Now our moms
are gonna find out we went

18:35.781 --> 18:37.156
to the Terrance and Phillip movie again!

18:37.241 --> 18:38.407
Vacuum!

18:38.492 --> 18:41.077
Try to untangle his trachea
and esophagus.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.621
- Dude!
- No, that doesn't go there!

18:46.416 --> 18:48.126
- Gross, Stan!
- That's sick.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.461
- Watch his liver.
- I'll get it.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.505
We have precious little time left,
people.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.589
We're gonna lose him soon.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.134
- Doctor, his heart stopped!
- Let's get it out of there.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.469
We need to zap this quick!

19:00.013 --> 19:03.099
- Who's making a potato?
- My bad, sir. I missed lunch.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.852
Damn it! I'm not gonna lose this kid!

19:06.145 --> 19:08.229
Close him up. We've done all we can.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.356
The rest is up to God.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.735
Kenny? Kenny, can you hear me?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.904
How are you feeling, son?

19:17.781 --> 19:20.074
Great. Son, I have some bad news.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.869
We accidentally replaced your heart
with a baked potato.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.621
You have about three seconds to live.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.665
Fucking weak, dude!

19:27.749 --> 19:30.543
- Oh, my God, they killed Kenny!
- You bastards!

19:30.627 --> 19:34.672
Damn it! It never gets any easier!

19:38.594 --> 19:41.512
I bet him he couldn't do it.
I bet him $100.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.014
Come on, Cartman, it's not your fault.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.099
No, I know. I'm just fucking stoked
I don't have to pay him.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.603
That's real nice!
He was your friend, you fat fuck!

19:48.687 --> 19:51.856
So, boys, you saw that movie again?

19:51.940 --> 19:54.275
- Yes.
- Well, Kyle, I have had it!

19:54.359 --> 19:57.278
You are grounded for
the next two weeks!

19:58.071 --> 20:00.615
- Grounded?
- And you, Stan. Come on.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.992
And you're grounded
for three weeks, Eric.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.244
Why am I grounded more?
That's fucking bullshit!

20:06.455 --> 20:09.498
What? What? What?
What was that word, young man?

20:23.055 --> 20:25.973
Little boy at peace

20:26.058 --> 20:29.602
What is this place beyond the stars?

20:30.145 --> 20:32.521
Open up your eyes

20:33.148 --> 20:37.068
What are these things
you're moving toward?

20:37.152 --> 20:40.154
Head so full of wonder

20:40.239 --> 20:42.573
worries in the past

20:42.866 --> 20:45.493
Could it be that you are free at last?

20:47.663 --> 20:48.746
No!

20:55.254 --> 20:57.922
Little boy, you're going to hell!

20:58.006 --> 20:59.382
You said bad words
Threw rocks at the birds

20:59.466 --> 21:00.841
And now this is your hotel

21:00.926 --> 21:04.387
You ain't going back
This ain't Disneyland, it's hell!

21:05.430 --> 21:08.099
Little boy, it's time for you to pay

21:08.183 --> 21:09.433
For hurting that bird
and not going to church

21:09.518 --> 21:10.851
And staring at boobs every day

21:10.936 --> 21:14.021
Thought you were in bed
Instead, you're in hell!

21:15.357 --> 21:22.530
Hell isn't good, hell isn't good
Hell!

21:23.865 --> 21:25.533
Hey, fuck-face, have you seen Gracie?

21:25.617 --> 21:29.036
There is orderliness in the universe.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.706
Hell isn't good, hell isn't good
No!

21:42.592 --> 21:45.553
Parents, our children are out of control!

21:45.762 --> 21:49.473
This is what happens when toilet humor
is allowed to run rampant!

21:49.558 --> 21:51.642
That's right. Kenny set himself on fire

21:51.727 --> 21:54.645
because he saw Terrance and Phillip
do it in that dirty movie!

21:54.730 --> 21:58.065
We must stop dirty language
from getting to our childrers ears!

21:58.150 --> 22:00.151
We must go fight the source of it!

22:00.235 --> 22:01.902
But what is the source?

22:01.987 --> 22:03.654
That's easy.

22:03.947 --> 22:06.824
Times have changed
Our kids are getting worse

22:06.908 --> 22:10.202
They won't obey their parents
They just want to fart and curse

22:10.287 --> 22:11.579
Should we blame the government?

22:11.663 --> 22:13.164
Or blame society?

22:13.248 --> 22:15.624
Or should we blame the images on TV?

22:15.709 --> 22:17.668
No! Blame Canada!

22:17.753 --> 22:19.170
Blame Canada!

22:19.254 --> 22:22.340
With all their beady little eyes
and fiapping heads so full of lies

22:22.424 --> 22:25.384
Blame Canada! Blame Canada!

22:25.469 --> 22:26.927
We need to form a full assault

22:27.012 --> 22:28.763
It's Canada's fault!

22:29.181 --> 22:32.016
Don't blame me for my son Stan

22:32.100 --> 22:35.186
He saw the darn cartoon
and now he's off to join the Klan

22:35.270 --> 22:38.189
And my boy Eric once
had my picture on his shelf

22:38.273 --> 22:40.608
But now when I see him
he tells me to fuck myself

22:40.692 --> 22:44.153
Well, Blame Canada! Blame Canada!

22:44.237 --> 22:47.531
It seems that everything's gone wrong
since Canada came along

22:47.616 --> 22:50.534
Blame Canada! Blame Canada!

22:50.619 --> 22:53.829
They're not even a real country anyway

22:53.914 --> 22:56.957
My son could've been a doctor
or a lawyer rich and true

22:57.042 --> 23:00.336
Instead, he burned up like a piggy
on a barbecue

23:00.420 --> 23:03.047
Should we blame the matches?
Should we blame the fire?

23:03.131 --> 23:05.341
Or the doctors who allowed him
to expire?

23:05.425 --> 23:06.384
Heck, no!

23:06.468 --> 23:09.220
Blame Canada! Blame Canada!

23:09.304 --> 23:10.888
With all their hockey hullabaloo

23:10.972 --> 23:12.556
And that bitch Anne Murray, too

23:12.641 --> 23:15.684
Blame Canada! Shame on Canada!

23:15.769 --> 23:16.727
For

23:16.812 --> 23:18.229
The smut we must stop
The trash we must bash

23:18.313 --> 23:19.772
The laughter and fun must all be undone

23:19.856 --> 23:21.232
We must blame them and cause a fuss

23:21.316 --> 23:25.236
Before somebody thinks of blaming us!

23:31.243 --> 23:33.160
All right, you turds, listen up!

23:33.245 --> 23:37.039
Your moms are away at a meeting
and they put me in charge of you!

23:37.124 --> 23:40.418
But you're still grounded,
so you're not allowed to have any fun!

23:40.502 --> 23:43.671
- Any questions?
- Shelly, where's the clitoris?

23:45.674 --> 23:48.300
Now you all just sit there
and keep your mouths shut

23:48.385 --> 23:51.679
while I go listen
to my Britney Spears records.

23:53.807 --> 23:54.849
Okay, it's clear.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.437
Our next guests have the number one
movie in the world right now.

23:59.521 --> 24:02.189
Please welcome Terrance and Phillip!

24:02.607 --> 24:03.732
Hooray!

24:05.610 --> 24:07.611
- Hello, Conan.
- Hello, Brooke Shields.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.905
Now, guys, some people claim
that your Canadian humor

24:09.990 --> 24:11.907
is nothing but immature fart jokes.

24:11.992 --> 24:15.911
That's not true. Take this classic
Canadian joke, for instance.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.873
- Excuse me, Terrance.
- Yes, Phillip?

24:20.625 --> 24:21.667
Gosh darn it!

24:23.044 --> 24:25.087
- Good one, Phillip. Cheers.
- Cheers, fuck-face.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.964
Guys, you can't say that on TV.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.508
Now Terrance smells like my ass!

24:29.593 --> 24:32.428
I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.226
So, guys, does it make you nervous
to be in America?

24:39.311 --> 24:40.603
There are a lot of organizations here

24:40.687 --> 24:42.730
that want you arrested for
destroying children.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.232
- They'd have to find us first.
- You're right.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.317
Now!

24:47.527 --> 24:48.569
Terrance and Phillip,

24:48.653 --> 24:52.198
Mothers Against Canada
is placing you under citizens arrest!

24:52.282 --> 24:53.824
- Mom?
- Dude, what the hell is going on?

24:53.909 --> 24:56.160
We have a court order for your arrest!

24:56.244 --> 24:57.828
Phillip, we've been ambushed!

24:57.913 --> 24:59.497
Here you go, Conan.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.790
This little scrotum sucker deceived us!

25:01.875 --> 25:04.168
- You are a bad man!
- Don't listen to them, Conan!

25:04.252 --> 25:06.837
You loved our movie, Conan!
We watched it together!

25:06.922 --> 25:09.965
- Remember? You laughed!
- What have I done?

25:18.767 --> 25:22.770
Holy crap! Did you see that?
They arrested Terrance and Phillip!

25:27.108 --> 25:28.317
As the Canadian Ambassador,

25:28.401 --> 25:30.611
I hereby condemn the actions
taken by America

25:30.695 --> 25:32.655
in apprehending Terrance and Phillip.

25:32.739 --> 25:33.739
As you can see from this graph,

25:33.823 --> 25:36.283
the entire economy of Canada
relies on Terrance and Phillip!

25:36.368 --> 25:39.119
Without them,
we are doomed to recession.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.373
What say you,
Mr. American Ambassador?

25:44.626 --> 25:46.877
- Fuck Canada!
- Hey, fuck you, buddy!

25:46.962 --> 25:48.837
Terrance and Phillip
will not be released!

25:48.922 --> 25:51.924
They're going to be put on trial for
corrupting America's youth.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.551
We don't know
what all the fuss is about.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.427
The fuss is aboot taking our citizens!

25:55.512 --> 25:59.390
It's aboot not censoring our art!
It's aboot... It's aboot...

25:59.474 --> 26:00.975
What's so goddamn funny?

26:01.059 --> 26:02.434
Nothing, nothing.

26:02.519 --> 26:05.688
Could you tell us again what your
argument is all about?

26:05.772 --> 26:08.232
This is not aboot diplomacy,
this is aboot dignity!

26:08.316 --> 26:12.027
This is aboot respect!
This is aboot realizing that humor...

26:12.571 --> 26:14.363
You guys are dicks!
Release Terrance and Phillip

26:14.447 --> 26:17.157
or we'll give you something
to cry aboot!

26:29.588 --> 26:32.214
Pilot to bombardier. Pilot to bombardier.
We're nearing the target.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.632
The bomb's ready, buddy.

26:34.467 --> 26:37.094
Baldwin residence.
No, this is Billy Baldwin.

26:37.178 --> 26:40.931
If you want Daniel Baldwin,
call his extension, stupid!

26:41.016 --> 26:43.684
Hey, Alec, do you know
what sucks about being a Baldwin?

26:43.768 --> 26:46.103
- No, what?
- Nothing! Yeah!

26:53.361 --> 26:54.945
You missed me!

26:58.617 --> 27:00.743
All right, children,
your mothers are all making me

27:00.827 --> 27:03.120
throw away my lesson plan
and teach theirs.

27:03.204 --> 27:05.539
Mr. Garrison, how come our moms
arrested Terrance and Phillip?

27:05.624 --> 27:06.957
- Yeah!
- That's gay.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.043
Well, your moms are just upset.

27:09.127 --> 27:11.837
They're probably all on their
periods or something.

27:11.921 --> 27:15.132
Mr. Garrison, Wendy and I think
that was a sexist statement.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.300
Well, I'm sorry, Wendy,

27:16.384 --> 27:20.054
but I just don't trust anything that
bleeds for five days and doesn't die.

27:20.138 --> 27:23.307
Anyway, children,
let's start off with some vocabulary.

27:23.391 --> 27:25.476
- Attention, students!
- What now?

27:25.560 --> 27:29.938
Come to the gymnasium immediately
for a special announcement, m'kay?

27:32.776 --> 27:35.361
- What's going on, Chef?
- Something big, children.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.571
Chef, I can't find the clitoris.
You have to help me.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.031
Stan, the clitoris...

27:39.115 --> 27:42.785
Please take your seats, everyone.
They're about to announce it, m'kay?

27:43.203 --> 27:44.703
This is a state of emergency.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.497
We go now to the White House
for an announcement

27:46.581 --> 27:48.957
from the President of the United States.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.501
My fellowAmericans,

27:50.585 --> 27:54.755
at 5:00 a.m. Today,
a day which will live in infamy,

27:55.507 --> 27:58.801
the Canadians have bombed
the Baldwins.

27:58.885 --> 28:03.305
In response to this,
the U.S. has declared war on Canada.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.559
- Oh, no!
- War?

28:07.644 --> 28:10.688
- No, Gregory! No!
- This is bad, Wendy. Hold on to me.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.439
All the Baldwins are dead?

28:12.524 --> 28:15.609
Now it is the time for us to send
a message to Canadians.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.071
In two days time,
the war criminals Terrance and Phillip

28:19.155 --> 28:20.906
will be executed.

28:21.741 --> 28:23.033
They're gonna kill them?

28:23.118 --> 28:26.954
And now I'd like to bring up my newly
appointed Secretary of Offense,

28:27.038 --> 28:29.039
Ms. Sheila Broflovski.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.374
Holy shit, dude!

28:30.458 --> 28:31.875
My fellow Americans,

28:31.960 --> 28:36.046
our neighbor to the north
has abused us for the last time!

28:36.131 --> 28:38.257
- I have a plan...
- The Canadians want to fight us

28:38.341 --> 28:40.884
because we won't tolerate
their potty mouths!

28:40.969 --> 28:46.056
Well, if it is war they want,
then war they shall have!

28:48.476 --> 28:52.354
- Dude, this is fucking weak.
- How could things be any worse?

29:03.908 --> 29:06.994
Fallen one, I am Satan.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.621
I am your god now.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.168
There is no escape.

29:17.255 --> 29:20.174
Now, feel the delightful pain.

29:20.967 --> 29:24.011
Hey, Satan, did you hear the news?

29:24.095 --> 29:26.680
A war just broke out up on Earth.

29:26.765 --> 29:30.309
Meet Saddam Hussein,
my new partner in evil.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.853
Move over, Satan,
you're hogging all the fun.

29:32.937 --> 29:36.607
Yeah! Yeah!
Man, this is getting me so hot!

29:37.358 --> 29:39.151
Saddam, would you let me
do my job, please?

29:39.235 --> 29:41.779
Come on, rub my nipples
while I torture this little piggy!

29:41.863 --> 29:45.115
Saddam, could I talk to you
over here for a second?

29:46.409 --> 29:50.329
I don't see why you have to belittle me
in front of people like that.

29:50.413 --> 29:51.705
Relax, guy!

29:51.790 --> 29:54.708
Well, sometimes I think you don't have
any respect for me.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.835
Hey, come here, guy.

29:57.754 --> 30:00.380
- Who's my cream puff?
- I am.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.341
That's right, buddy.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.805
- Dude, I don't want to be at war.
- You don't think they're really

30:07.889 --> 30:09.139
gonna kill Terrance and Phillip,
do you?

30:09.224 --> 30:11.308
Kyle, you need to stop
being such a chicken shit

30:11.392 --> 30:12.392
and stand up to your mother.

30:12.477 --> 30:13.977
You need to smack her
in the face and say,

30:14.062 --> 30:15.562
"That's enough of your shit,
you fucking bitch!"

30:15.647 --> 30:17.397
Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

30:17.482 --> 30:19.274
You guys stop it! This isn't helping!

30:19.359 --> 30:20.484
We've gotta think here!

30:20.568 --> 30:22.820
Now, let's see,
what would Brian Boitano do?

30:22.904 --> 30:25.405
Yeah, what would Brian Boitano do?

30:28.243 --> 30:29.576
Hey, what's going on over there?

30:29.661 --> 30:32.329
The American government thinks
it has the right to police the world.

30:32.413 --> 30:34.498
Your government is going
to kill two Canadian citizens,

30:34.582 --> 30:38.168
an action condemned by the U.N.
Home of the free, indeed.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.505
- Let's play tetherball.
- Yeah.

30:41.589 --> 30:44.216
This is about freedom of speech!
About censorship!

30:44.300 --> 30:45.551
Can't you guys be more political
like Gregory?

30:45.635 --> 30:48.303
There's the girl that I like

30:49.347 --> 30:53.267
Now it appears
that she likes another guy

30:53.351 --> 30:57.354
It must be because
he's political and stuff

30:58.398 --> 31:01.191
I bet I could be political, too

31:01.276 --> 31:03.318
What do you think, Stan?

31:05.029 --> 31:07.698
- Damn it!
- You guys, this is all Kyle's mom's fault!

31:07.782 --> 31:08.740
Shut up, Cartman!

31:08.825 --> 31:10.784
Kyle's mom is the one
that started that damn club,

31:10.869 --> 31:13.036
and all because
she's a big, fat, stupid...

31:13.121 --> 31:14.955
Don't say it, Cartman!

31:15.039 --> 31:16.039
Well...

31:16.124 --> 31:17.958
Don't do it, Cartman!

31:18.293 --> 31:19.418
Well...

31:19.502 --> 31:21.837
- I'm warning you!
- Okay. Okay.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.464
I'm getting pretty sick of
him calling my mom...

31:24.549 --> 31:25.757
well, Kyle's mom's a bitch
She's a big fat witch

31:25.842 --> 31:27.384
She's the biggest bitch
in the whole wide world

31:27.468 --> 31:28.844
She's a stupid bitch
if there ever was a bitch

31:28.928 --> 31:31.305
She's a bitch to all the boys and girls

31:31.389 --> 31:33.599
Shut your fucking mouth, Cartman!

31:33.683 --> 31:35.058
On Monday she's a bitch
On Tuesday she's a bitch

31:35.143 --> 31:36.602
And wednesday through Saturday
she's a bitch

31:36.686 --> 31:38.228
Then on Sunday, just to be different

31:38.313 --> 31:41.064
She's a super
King Kamehameha bitch!

31:41.149 --> 31:42.733
Come on, you all know the words!

31:42.817 --> 31:44.109
Have you ever met
my friend Kyle's mom?

31:44.193 --> 31:45.694
She's the biggest bitch
in the whole wide world

31:45.778 --> 31:47.237
She's a mean old bitch
and she has stupid hair

31:47.322 --> 31:48.864
She's a bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch

31:48.948 --> 31:51.909
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
She's a stupid bitch

31:51.993 --> 31:55.037
Kyle's mom's a bitch
and she's just a dirty bitch

31:55.121 --> 31:56.413
Talk to kids around the world

31:56.497 --> 31:58.081
It might go a little bit
something like this

32:10.219 --> 32:11.595
Have you ever met
my friend Kyle's mom?

32:11.679 --> 32:13.055
She's the biggest bitch
in the whole wide world

32:13.139 --> 32:14.598
She's a mean old bitch
and she has stupid hair

32:14.682 --> 32:16.266
She's a bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch

32:16.351 --> 32:18.852
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
She's a stupid bitch

32:18.937 --> 32:19.937
Cartman...

32:20.021 --> 32:21.980
Kyle's mom's a bitch
and she's just a dirty bitch

32:22.065 --> 32:23.398
I really mean it

32:23.483 --> 32:25.359
Kyle's mom

32:25.777 --> 32:30.656
She's a big fat fucking bitch

32:30.740 --> 32:33.450
Big, old, fat fucking bitch, Kyle's mom

32:33.534 --> 32:35.202
Yeah!

32:39.707 --> 32:40.874
What?

32:43.127 --> 32:44.169
Fuck.

32:44.545 --> 32:46.964
Okay, everyone settle down.

32:47.048 --> 32:49.675
As we continue to send troops
into Canada,

32:49.759 --> 32:53.261
M.A.C. is also fighting the war
against potty mouths here at home!

32:53.346 --> 32:57.182
Here to present the V-Chip
is Dr. Vosknocker.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.646
The machinery of the V-Chip
is very simple.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.606
It is placed under the child's skin

33:04.691 --> 33:06.692
where it emits a small shock
of electricity

33:06.776 --> 33:08.443
whenever an obscenity is uttered.

33:08.528 --> 33:09.820
Now, wait a minute.

33:09.904 --> 33:12.322
This chip somehow knows
if the child is swearing?

33:12.407 --> 33:13.657
It's just like a lie detector.

33:13.741 --> 33:15.534
You see, certain things happen to you
when you swear,

33:15.618 --> 33:16.743
just like when you lie.

33:16.828 --> 33:20.330
The chip picks up on this
and gives the subject a little prick.

33:20.415 --> 33:23.250
Patient B5,
would you step out here, please?

33:23.334 --> 33:26.920
Patient B5 here has been fitted
with the new V-Chip.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.714
- My head hurts.
- Don't worry about that.

33:28.798 --> 33:31.091
Now I want you to say "doggy."

33:32.343 --> 33:35.095
- Doggy.
- Notice that nothing happens.

33:35.179 --> 33:38.557
- Now say "Montana."
- Montana.

33:38.641 --> 33:40.684
Good! Now, "pillow."

33:40.768 --> 33:42.519
- Pillow.
- All right.

33:42.603 --> 33:45.355
Now I want you to say "horse fucker."

33:46.399 --> 33:48.483
Go ahead, Eric. It's all right.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.193
Horse...

33:51.279 --> 33:54.031
That hurt, goddamn... Fuck!

33:54.115 --> 33:57.075
Now I'd like you to say
"big floppy donkey dick."

33:57.160 --> 33:58.660
- No!
- Success!

33:58.745 --> 34:00.787
The child doesn't want to swear!

34:00.872 --> 34:03.081
This isn't fair, you sons of bitches!

34:03.166 --> 34:07.419
We will start putting V-Chips
in all our children next week!

34:10.214 --> 34:13.592
Snacky Smores presents
The March of War.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.217
Let's hear it for our boys in blue.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.803
President Clinton
has called them to action

34:16.888 --> 34:18.929
to fight the evil Canadian scourge.

34:19.014 --> 34:21.641
A full-scale attack
has been launched on Toronto

34:21.726 --> 34:23.226
after the Canadians' last bombing

34:23.311 --> 34:26.021
which took a horrible toll
on the Arquette family.

34:26.105 --> 34:28.356
For security measures,
our great American government

34:28.440 --> 34:30.817
is rounding up all citizens
that have any Canadian blood

34:30.902 --> 34:31.985
and putting them into camps.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.071
All Canadian-American
citizens are to report

34:34.155 --> 34:35.781
to one of these death camps right away.

34:35.864 --> 34:36.907
Did I say death camps?

34:36.991 --> 34:39.576
I meant happy camps,
where you will eat the finest meals,

34:39.659 --> 34:42.621
have access to fabulous doctors
and be able to exercise regularly.

34:42.705 --> 34:44.664
Meanwhile,
the war criminals Terrance and Phillip

34:44.748 --> 34:46.625
are prepped for their execution.

34:46.708 --> 34:50.295
Their execution will take place
during a fabulous USO show!

34:50.379 --> 34:54.257
With special guests celebrities,
including Big Gay Al and winona Ryder!

34:54.342 --> 34:56.885
Of course,
the only way to see the USO show

34:56.969 --> 34:58.553
is to sign up for the army!

34:58.638 --> 35:01.139
So join the army
and kill some Canadian scum

35:01.224 --> 35:04.810
as we continue the march of war!

35:09.107 --> 35:12.692
We must rid ourselves
of anything Canadian!

35:13.444 --> 35:14.444
Bomb them!

35:15.029 --> 35:16.988
Dude, don't you like
Terrance and Phillip anymore?

35:17.073 --> 35:18.240
Course not! My mommy says

35:18.324 --> 35:20.909
I hate Canadians now 'cause they
made me have a dirty mouth!

35:20.993 --> 35:22.661
Burn it all!

35:23.329 --> 35:25.288
- Hey, dudes.
- What's the matter, Cartman?

35:25.373 --> 35:28.500
It's this V-Chip. I hate it.
I can't say any dirty words.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.961
- Really? So you can't say "fuck"?
- No.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.963
- And you can't say "shit"?
- No.

35:33.047 --> 35:34.422
So you can't say, "I'm Eric Cartman,

35:34.507 --> 35:35.966
"the fattest fucking piece of shit
in the world"?

35:36.050 --> 35:38.301
- Fuck you...
- Sweet.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.053
Come on, you guys.
This has gone far enough.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.680
It's time we talked to our moms.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.306
We're supposed to be grounded
in our rooms.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.642
Come on, Kyle,
it's time for us to get political.

35:45.726 --> 35:48.812
Canada will no longer corrupt
our children!

35:48.896 --> 35:52.274
- Mom, can I talk to you for a second?
- Kyle, what are you doing here?

35:52.358 --> 35:53.650
You are grounded!

35:53.734 --> 35:55.986
Now get back to the house
and stay there!

35:56.070 --> 35:57.487
You too, Stanley!

35:57.572 --> 36:00.532
Mom, we think you're going too far.
You can't kill Terrance and Phillip.

36:00.616 --> 36:02.993
We must fight for
our children's futures...

36:03.077 --> 36:04.578
You started a war! You have to stop it!

36:04.662 --> 36:06.663
...to make them safe again!

36:06.747 --> 36:08.999
- Hello?
- Our children are precious!

36:09.083 --> 36:12.169
- Hello!
- We must make a stand now!

36:12.253 --> 36:14.004
Stop at nothing!

36:14.380 --> 36:15.672
I told you my mom wouldn't listen.

36:15.756 --> 36:18.175
Well, then we're just gonna have to
save Terrance and Phillip ourselves!

36:18.259 --> 36:19.801
- What?
- Think about it, you guys.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.094
What would Brian Boitano do?

36:21.179 --> 36:22.721
He'd figure out a way
to rescue Terrance and Phillip

36:22.805 --> 36:23.847
before they're executed.

36:23.931 --> 36:26.558
We can't do anything.
Our moms' organization is too strong.

36:26.642 --> 36:28.560
Well, then, we'll round up
all the grounded kids in town

36:28.644 --> 36:30.020
and start our own organization.

36:30.104 --> 36:32.022
An organization to help save
Terrance and Phillip.

36:32.106 --> 36:34.191
Hey, yeah, our own secret club!

36:34.275 --> 36:37.027
- I guess that could work.
- We have to try.

36:37.111 --> 36:40.197
What would Brian Boitano do
if he was here right now?

36:40.281 --> 36:42.032
He'd make a plan
and he'd follow through

36:42.116 --> 36:43.533
That's what Brian Boitano would do

36:43.618 --> 36:46.870
when Brian Boitano was in
the Olympics skating for the gold

36:46.954 --> 36:50.207
He did two salchows and a triple Lutz
while wearing a blindfold

36:50.291 --> 36:53.710
When Brian Boitano was in the Alps
fighting grizzly bears

36:53.794 --> 36:57.047
He used his magical fire breath
and saved the maidens fair

36:57.131 --> 37:00.425
So what would Brian Boitano do
if he were here today?

37:00.509 --> 37:04.095
I'm sure he'd kick and ass or two
That's what Brian Boitano would do

37:04.180 --> 37:07.557
I want this V-Chip out of me

37:07.642 --> 37:10.685
It has stunted my vocabulary

37:10.770 --> 37:14.147
And I just want my mom
to stop fighting everyone

37:14.232 --> 37:16.024
For wendy I'll be an activist, too

37:16.108 --> 37:17.692
'Cause that's what Brian Boitano
would do

37:17.777 --> 37:20.946
what would Brian Boitano do?
He'd call all the kids in town

37:21.030 --> 37:24.491
And tell them to unite for truth
That's what Brian Boitano would do

37:24.575 --> 37:27.535
- Did someone say my name?
- Who are you?

37:27.620 --> 37:29.788
- I'm Brian Dennehy.
- What?

37:29.872 --> 37:32.832
- No, not fucking Brian Dennehy!
- Yeah. Get the fuck out of here!

37:33.542 --> 37:34.584
Bye.

37:35.002 --> 37:36.670
When Brian Boitano
traveled through time

37:36.754 --> 37:38.255
To the year 3010

37:38.339 --> 37:41.675
He fought the evil robot king
and saved the human race again

37:41.759 --> 37:43.510
And when Brian Boitano
built the pyramids

37:43.594 --> 37:45.053
He beat up Kublai Khan

37:45.137 --> 37:49.975
'Cause Brian Boitano doesn't take shit
from anybody

37:50.059 --> 37:53.520
So let's call all the kids together
and unite to stop our moms

37:53.604 --> 37:55.438
And we'll save Terrance and Phillip, too

37:55.523 --> 37:57.148
'Cause that's what Brian Boitano
would do

37:57.233 --> 37:58.942
And we'll save Terrance and Phillip, too

37:59.026 --> 38:04.197
'Cause that's what Brian Boitano
would do

38:09.578 --> 38:11.288
Hey, relax, guy.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.415
There's nothing on.

38:13.499 --> 38:15.292
You just get cranky when you're tired,
that's all.

38:15.376 --> 38:16.418
I'm not cranky.

38:16.502 --> 38:19.421
What started as a spat between
the United States and Canada

38:19.505 --> 38:21.298
is quickly turning into world War III!

38:21.382 --> 38:22.716
World War III?

38:22.800 --> 38:24.342
Terrance and Phillip
are going to be put to death

38:24.427 --> 38:25.635
for crimes against humanity.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.053
The time of execution...

38:27.138 --> 38:31.433
It has come to be.
The four horsemen are drawing nigh!

38:31.517 --> 38:34.144
The time of prophecy is upon us!

38:34.228 --> 38:36.062
I love when you get all biblical, Satan.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.647
You know exactly how to turn my crank.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.859
No, I'm being serious.
It is the seventh sign.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.902
- What?
- Behold.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.822
The first signs of my reign
have all come true.

38:45.906 --> 38:48.658
The fall of an empire,
the coming of a comet,

38:48.743 --> 38:53.496
and now, when the blood of these
Canadians touches American soil,

38:53.581 --> 38:56.416
it will be our time to rise.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.503
Yeah. Yeah, man! I'm getting so hot!
Let's fuck!

39:00.588 --> 39:02.130
Do you always think about sex?

39:02.214 --> 39:04.716
I'm talking about
very important stuff here!

39:04.800 --> 39:07.802
I'm just excited about
taking over the world! Come on!

39:07.887 --> 39:10.305
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?

39:10.389 --> 39:11.765
I love you.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.517
I want to believe that.

39:14.602 --> 39:18.396
So what do you say we shut off that light
and get close, huh?

39:22.443 --> 39:24.861
Yeah, you like that, don't you, bitch?

39:27.782 --> 39:30.700
Okay. We can use my dad's computer
to call all the kids together.

39:30.785 --> 39:33.620
Wait. Before we put a message out,
do a search on the word "clitoris."

39:33.704 --> 39:35.038
Okay.

39:36.290 --> 39:38.291
Found eight million pages
with the word "clitoris."

39:38.376 --> 39:39.376
Wow!

39:39.460 --> 39:43.004
I'll just try the first one.
"You must be 18 to enter this website."

39:43.089 --> 39:46.257
Okay.
"Welcome to German sick fetish video."

39:46.342 --> 39:49.177
"If you are under 18 do not..." Okay.

39:52.181 --> 39:53.723
Dude, it's a lady getting pooed on!

39:53.808 --> 39:56.226
- Whoa! Is it Cartman's mom?
- Very funny.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.353
Hey! It is Cartman's mom!

39:59.146 --> 40:00.397
All righty then.

40:00.481 --> 40:01.898
Son of a bitch...

40:03.317 --> 40:04.901
Get out of here, Ike.
You're too young for this stuff.

40:04.985 --> 40:05.985
Bullshit.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.987
What's she doing now?

40:08.280 --> 40:09.697
Okey-dokey.

40:13.452 --> 40:14.911
Click it off, dude! Click it off!

40:14.995 --> 40:16.746
Dude, what the fuck is wrong
with German people?

40:16.831 --> 40:18.706
All right. All right.
Let's just do what we came here to do

40:18.791 --> 40:19.958
and put a message out to kids!

40:20.042 --> 40:22.502
Okay. Let's see. I've gotta put out
an all-access e-mail.

40:22.586 --> 40:23.962
Goddamn, your mom sucks, Cartman.

40:24.046 --> 40:25.213
Just get to the message board!

40:25.297 --> 40:28.675
I'm trying. I can't find a Canadian server.
I've got to break into the mainframe.

40:28.926 --> 40:32.595
Damn it, they've got an access code!
I'll try to reroute the encryptions.

40:36.016 --> 40:39.227
Okay. Here we go.
"Want to help Terrance and Phillip?"

40:43.232 --> 40:45.692
- Tell them we'll have punch and pie.
- We're not gonna have punch and pie!

40:45.776 --> 40:49.446
More people will come
if they think we have punch and pie!

40:51.198 --> 40:54.492
"This is top secret. The password is..."

40:54.994 --> 40:56.703
La Résistance.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.456
And so the draft will begin tomorrow

40:59.540 --> 41:02.584
as more and more troops are needed
to invade the Canadian border.

41:02.668 --> 41:04.627
The Canadian government pleads
for a peaceful resolution,

41:04.712 --> 41:07.255
but naturally we're not listening.

41:07.506 --> 41:08.590
Good night, hon.

41:08.674 --> 41:10.967
Mom, when is the war gonna be over?

41:11.051 --> 41:13.344
I don't know, hon. Soon, we hope.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.763
You want it to end quickly, huh?

41:17.641 --> 41:19.601
- Mom?
- Yes, hon?

41:19.685 --> 41:23.646
If you were in a German Scheiße video,
you'd tell me, right?

41:24.857 --> 41:26.774
Sure, hon. Good night.

41:36.827 --> 41:37.827
There's a ghost!

41:39.497 --> 41:41.331
Kenny, is that you?

41:43.334 --> 41:45.502
Satan! Satan is coming here?

41:46.253 --> 41:49.380
Saddam Hussein?
That doesn't make sense, Kenny!

41:51.967 --> 41:54.677
- Eric, what is it?
- I saw him! I saw Kenny!

41:54.762 --> 41:58.014
You poor dear.
You've been through so much.

41:58.098 --> 42:01.392
I bet him he couldn't light a fart on fire
and now he's all pissed off!

42:01.477 --> 42:03.019
I can't say "pissed off"?

42:05.105 --> 42:07.565
The execution of Terrance and Phillip
is imminent.

42:07.650 --> 42:10.443
Soon, Saddam and I will rule the world.

42:12.446 --> 42:15.448
Hi, Satan. I got some new luggage
for our trip up to Earth.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.616
Let's fuck to celebrate.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.869
What's it like up on Earth, Saddam?
Tell me about it again.

42:19.954 --> 42:21.996
Let's not talk. Let's get busy.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.873
Do you remember
when you first got here?

42:23.958 --> 42:27.043
We used to talk all night long
until the sun came up.

42:27.127 --> 42:29.796
We would just lie in bed and talk.

42:29.880 --> 42:32.507
Well, yeah, 'cause I was still waiting
to get you in bed, dummy!

42:32.591 --> 42:35.051
How come you always wanna
make love to me from behind?

42:35.135 --> 42:37.845
Is it because you want to pretend
I'm somebody else?

42:37.930 --> 42:40.473
Satan, your ass is gigantic and red.

42:40.558 --> 42:43.601
Who am I gonna pretend you are,
Liza Minnelli?

42:45.479 --> 42:47.313
Don't get all pissy!

42:54.446 --> 42:57.198
Sometimes I think

42:57.616 --> 42:59.909
When I look up real high

43:00.578 --> 43:03.746
That there's such a big world up there

43:03.831 --> 43:06.291
I'd like to give it a try

43:07.251 --> 43:09.419
But then I sink

43:09.503 --> 43:12.422
'Cause it's here I'm supposed to stay

43:12.506 --> 43:15.258
But I get so lonely down here

43:15.342 --> 43:19.512
Tell me why's it have to be that way

43:20.347 --> 43:22.932
Up there, there is so much room

43:23.017 --> 43:26.019
Where babies burp and fiowers bloom

43:26.103 --> 43:29.230
Everyone dreams
I can dream, too

43:29.315 --> 43:34.110
Up there
Up where the skies are ocean blue

43:34.486 --> 43:38.239
I could be safe and live without a care

43:38.324 --> 43:41.326
Up there

43:41.744 --> 43:44.454
They say I don't belong

43:44.538 --> 43:47.290
I must stay below alone

43:47.791 --> 43:53.463
Because of my beliefs I'm supposed to
stay where evil is sown

43:54.048 --> 43:59.135
But what is evil anyway?
Is there reason to the rhyme?

43:59.511 --> 44:01.596
Without evil there could be no good

44:01.680 --> 44:06.184
So it must be good
to be evil sometimes

44:07.227 --> 44:09.937
Up there, there is so much room

44:10.022 --> 44:13.107
Where babies burp and fiowers bloom

44:13.192 --> 44:16.110
Everyone dreams
I can dream, too

44:16.195 --> 44:21.240
Up there
Up where the skies are ocean blue

44:21.325 --> 44:25.787
I could be safe and live without a care

44:25.871 --> 44:28.039
Live without a care

44:28.707 --> 44:32.627
If only I could live up there

44:33.629 --> 44:36.214
I wanna live
I wanna live

44:40.928 --> 44:45.098
I want to live up there!

44:56.443 --> 44:58.361
- You're late, Cartman!
- I had to ride my bike here.

44:58.445 --> 45:00.613
- My behind is killing me!
- Your behind?

45:00.698 --> 45:03.866
I have to say "behind"
'cause I get shocked if I say "ass"...

45:03.951 --> 45:07.537
- Did you bring the punch and pie?
- No, you guys, something happened.

45:07.621 --> 45:09.872
- I don't think Kenny's dead.
- What?

45:09.957 --> 45:10.998
I saw him in my room.

45:11.083 --> 45:13.376
I know, Cartman, I know.
I see Kenny every day.

45:13.460 --> 45:16.045
- You do?
- Sure, dude, on the face of every child.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.214
On the smile of every baby.

45:18.298 --> 45:20.174
Hey, I'm telling you, this was Kenny!

45:20.259 --> 45:21.968
He said that if Terrance and Phillip die,

45:22.052 --> 45:25.304
Saddam Hussein and Satan
are gonna come up and rule the world!

45:25.389 --> 45:26.931
Saddam Hussein?

45:31.979 --> 45:34.564
- Who is it?
- I'm here for la Résistance.

45:34.648 --> 45:37.191
- What's the password?
- I don't know.

45:37.276 --> 45:39.819
- Guess.
- Bacon.

45:40.654 --> 45:41.988
Okay.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.034
Oh, no, it's that kid!

45:47.119 --> 45:49.412
- This is the place.
- Wendy?

45:49.496 --> 45:51.914
Stan? You started la Résistance?

45:52.666 --> 45:54.792
Well, apparently you're more political
than we thought.

45:54.877 --> 45:56.878
Let us get this meeting underway.
There are others coming.

46:00.424 --> 46:02.759
Wow, a lot of people showed up.

46:04.428 --> 46:05.595
Okay.

46:05.679 --> 46:07.680
Terrance and Phillip
are supposed to be killed,

46:07.765 --> 46:09.891
and we think that sucks ass!

46:11.810 --> 46:12.810
Yes?

46:12.895 --> 46:15.438
We were to understand
there'd be pie and punch.

46:15.522 --> 46:17.148
There isn't any.

46:21.153 --> 46:23.029
Terrance and Phillip
are supposed to be killed,

46:23.113 --> 46:25.364
so we think we should prank call
a bunch of policemen

46:25.449 --> 46:28.785
and have pizza sent to them
that they didn't order!

46:32.790 --> 46:34.290
- May I?
- What?

46:34.875 --> 46:36.125
Terrance and Phillip
are currently being held

46:36.210 --> 46:38.419
at a Canadian internment camp
two kilometers outside of town.

46:38.504 --> 46:39.712
They're to be executed tomorrow during

46:39.797 --> 46:41.464
a star-studded USO show
for the troops.

46:41.548 --> 46:42.590
Tomorrow?

46:42.674 --> 46:44.300
Once the show begins,
we should have about one hour

46:44.384 --> 46:45.802
to get Terrance and Phillip
out of their cell

46:45.886 --> 46:46.928
and into this clearing.

46:47.012 --> 46:48.471
There, we will all rendezvous
and, together,

46:48.555 --> 46:50.306
take Terrance and Phillip
safely back to Canada.

46:50.390 --> 46:52.225
Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.

46:52.309 --> 46:54.977
You must all meet me at the rendezvous
point at precisely 10:00 p.m.

46:55.062 --> 46:56.938
Sneaking into the show and breaking out
Terrance and Phillip

46:57.022 --> 47:00.316
will be the most dangerous part,
so I'll go myself.

47:00.567 --> 47:02.235
No! We're going!

47:02.736 --> 47:03.820
We started la Résistance.

47:03.904 --> 47:06.155
We'll get Terrance and Phillip
and meet you at the rendezvous point.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.950
This will be very dangerous.
Are you quite sure?

47:09.034 --> 47:10.159
Fuck that!

47:10.244 --> 47:11.828
Cartman, do you want
that V-Chip in you forever?

47:11.912 --> 47:14.872
We're going.
Now let's run through the plan.

47:24.550 --> 47:26.759
Oh, boy! Military action, Ned!

47:26.844 --> 47:29.637
Let's kill us
some goddamn Australians!

47:29.721 --> 47:31.764
I think we're fighting Canadians.

47:31.849 --> 47:34.016
Canadians, Australians,
what's the difference?

47:34.101 --> 47:38.563
Yeah. This uniform makes me feel
like a tough, brute man, Mr. Hat.

47:38.647 --> 47:40.648
It sure does, Mr. Garrison.

47:40.732 --> 47:42.900
Oh, boy, I can't wait for
our first shore leave

47:42.985 --> 47:46.070
so I can get me some fucking poontang.

47:46.154 --> 47:47.154
Pay attention!

47:47.239 --> 47:50.491
Tomorrow night is the USO show
for all you troops!

47:50.576 --> 47:55.288
There will be celebrities, followed by
the execution of Terrance and Phillip.

47:55.789 --> 48:00.084
After the show, we will finally be
sending ground troops into Canada.

48:00.168 --> 48:01.460
So let's strategize.

48:01.545 --> 48:02.795
Map!

48:03.589 --> 48:05.715
Our sources have told us
that the Canadians

48:05.799 --> 48:08.676
are preparing for our invasion,
so we must use caution.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.137
Each battalion has
a specific code name and mission.

48:11.221 --> 48:13.639
Battalion Five, raise your hands.

48:13.724 --> 48:16.058
You will be the all-important
first attack wave,

48:16.143 --> 48:18.895
which we will call
Operation Human Shield.

48:18.979 --> 48:20.062
Hey, wait a minute!

48:20.147 --> 48:23.274
Now keep in mind, Operation Human
Shield will suffer heavy losses.

48:23.358 --> 48:24.859
Battalion Fourteen?

48:25.360 --> 48:28.237
Right. You are
Operation Get Behind the Darkies.

48:28.322 --> 48:30.072
You will follow Battalion Five here.

48:30.157 --> 48:33.910
And try not to get killed, for God's sake.
Are there any questions, men?

48:33.994 --> 48:34.994
Yes, soldier?

48:35.078 --> 48:37.705
Have you ever heard of
the Emancipation Proclamation?

48:37.789 --> 48:39.373
I don't listen to hip-hop.

48:39.458 --> 48:43.544
After that, we will march
into the heart of Canada and we will...

48:43.629 --> 48:45.463
I'm coming to get you!
I'm coming to get you!

48:45.547 --> 48:47.840
What's wrong with this thing?

48:48.258 --> 48:51.594
It's fucking Windows 98!
Get Bill Gates in here!

48:54.848 --> 48:57.600
You told us Windows 98 would be faster
and more efficient

48:57.684 --> 48:59.101
with better access to the Internet.

48:59.186 --> 49:01.771
It is faster. Over five million...

49:02.481 --> 49:06.692
All right, men, get lots of rest
and prepare to go into Canada!

49:10.030 --> 49:12.531
After you have Terrance and Phillip,
quietly make your way to this ridge.

49:12.616 --> 49:14.700
We will be waiting for you there.
We cannot wait for long,

49:14.785 --> 49:16.619
so if you're not there at 10:00,
we'll have to leave.

49:16.703 --> 49:18.037
- Got you.
- You are indeed brave,

49:18.121 --> 49:20.581
but you will need help from someone
who's done this sort of thing before.

49:20.666 --> 49:23.167
- Here's the address of The Mole.
- The Mole?

49:23.251 --> 49:25.628
He is an expert in covert operations.
A mercenary for hire.

49:25.712 --> 49:28.506
Your first task will be obtaining him.
Get lots of sleep.

49:28.590 --> 49:32.093
Tomorrow, we will all be
risking our lives for freedom.

49:32.344 --> 49:36.222
God has smiled upon you this day

49:37.015 --> 49:41.727
The fate of a nation in your hands

49:41.812 --> 49:44.480
And blessed be the children

49:44.564 --> 49:47.316
Who fight with all our bravery

49:47.401 --> 49:51.612
Till only the righteous stand

49:52.364 --> 49:55.658
You see the distant flames
They bellow in the night

49:55.742 --> 49:59.036
You fight in all our names
for what we know is right

49:59.121 --> 50:02.248
And when you all get shot
and cannot carry on

50:02.332 --> 50:05.251
Though you die, la Résistance lives on

50:05.752 --> 50:08.963
You may get stabbed in the head
with a dagger or a sword

50:09.047 --> 50:12.133
You may be burned to death
or skinned alive or worse

50:12.217 --> 50:15.011
But when they torture you
you will not feel the need to run

50:15.095 --> 50:18.180
For though you die
la Résistance lives on

50:18.265 --> 50:21.225
Blame Canada! Blame Canada!

50:21.309 --> 50:25.563
Because the country's gone awry
Tomorrow night these freaks will fry!

50:26.106 --> 50:29.066
Tomorrow night, our lives will change

50:29.151 --> 50:31.986
Tomorrow night, we'll be entertained

50:32.404 --> 50:35.197
An execution
What a sight

50:35.282 --> 50:36.240
Tomorrow night

50:36.324 --> 50:38.993
Up there, there is so much room
Where babies burp and fiowers bloom

50:39.077 --> 50:42.204
Tomorrow night, up there is doomed
And so I will be going soon

50:42.289 --> 50:44.874
Shut your fucking face, uncle fucka

50:44.958 --> 50:48.335
You're a boner-biting bastard
Uncle fucka

50:48.420 --> 50:49.795
Looks like we may be out of luck

50:49.880 --> 50:51.380
Tomorrow night, we're pretty fucked

50:51.465 --> 50:54.467
Why did our mothers start this war?
What the fuck are they fighting for?

50:54.551 --> 50:56.469
When did this song
become a marathon?

50:56.553 --> 50:58.888
- I want to be up there...
- When Canada is dead and gone

50:58.972 --> 51:00.431
There'll be no more Celine Dion!

51:00.515 --> 51:03.601
They might cut your dick in half
and serve it to a pig

51:03.685 --> 51:06.645
And though it hurts
you'll laugh and dance a dickless jig

51:06.730 --> 51:09.523
But that's the way it goes
In war, you're shat upon

51:09.608 --> 51:11.484
- Though we die...
- I want to be up there...

51:11.568 --> 51:15.321
...la Résistance lives on!

51:15.655 --> 51:18.741
Blame Canada! Blame Canada!

51:18.825 --> 51:20.659
- Tomorrow night!
- Tomorrow night!

51:25.999 --> 51:27.625
Oh, boy, I'm so excited!

51:27.709 --> 51:29.877
Just one more day
until we can take over the world.

51:29.961 --> 51:32.463
I don't know if I can sleep,
if you know what I mean.

51:32.547 --> 51:33.964
This book is really interesting.

51:34.049 --> 51:36.425
It talks about how people
communicate differently.

51:36.510 --> 51:39.762
Like, I communicate by wanting you
to ask me questions, and you...

51:39.846 --> 51:42.556
Hey, that is interesting! Let's fuck!

51:42.641 --> 51:45.643
Saddam, I'm trying to have
a nice conversation with you.

51:45.727 --> 51:47.353
Hey, Satan.

51:47.896 --> 51:50.022
Now that is just not appropriate!

51:50.107 --> 51:53.067
Come on, I'm just fucking with you!
It's not real!

51:53.151 --> 51:56.362
- Well, that is still not appropriate.
- Hey, daddy.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.657
It's not real, either! Come on, guy!

52:06.164 --> 52:08.749
Soon the world will belong to me!

52:11.545 --> 52:14.922
It's Saddam,
he doesn't nurture my emotions.

52:15.006 --> 52:18.175
He just wants sex
and can't learn to communicate.

52:19.845 --> 52:22.513
You're right, I should leave him!
I'm just gonna tell him,

52:22.597 --> 52:25.307
"Saddam,
I'm going to Earth to rule alone!"

52:25.392 --> 52:27.893
I'm strong and I don't need him!

52:32.315 --> 52:34.650
Today's the day for the USO show

52:34.734 --> 52:36.735
we're so happy we get to go

52:36.820 --> 52:38.779
I don't know but I've been told

52:38.864 --> 52:40.656
Canadian pussy is mighty cold...

52:40.740 --> 52:42.992
Ike, you have to stay in the attic
'cause if they find you,

52:43.076 --> 52:46.287
they'll put you
in a Canadian concentration camp.

52:46.580 --> 52:48.664
Don't worry, Ike,
we're gonna put an end to this.

52:48.748 --> 52:52.835
And then I'll make Mom come home
and we'll all be a family again.

52:56.089 --> 52:57.840
All of that is home.

53:12.898 --> 53:16.692
- Hello?
- Hi. We need to speak with The Mole.

53:16.776 --> 53:20.487
I'm sorry, The Mole is grounded.
He can't come out and play.

53:20.572 --> 53:21.655
- What?
- He's a kid?

53:21.740 --> 53:24.366
He said very naughty things about God.

53:24.451 --> 53:26.785
Well, can we just talk to him
for five seconds, please?

53:26.870 --> 53:29.205
Well, all right. Christophe?

53:31.499 --> 53:33.751
Hi, we're gonna go rescue
Terrance and Phillip

53:33.835 --> 53:35.377
from the USO show and...

53:35.462 --> 53:37.087
- Who are you? Who sent you?
- That Gregory kid.

53:37.172 --> 53:38.380
He said you could sneak us in.

53:38.465 --> 53:41.008
Are you telling me that you intend to
break into the USO show,

53:41.092 --> 53:44.428
filled with thousands of soldiers,
and break out Terrance and Phillip?

53:44.512 --> 53:46.263
I thought it was a pretty stupid idea, too.

53:46.348 --> 53:47.389
We're la Résistance!

53:47.474 --> 53:50.017
We wanna save Terrance and Phillip
and stop the war and stuff.

53:50.101 --> 53:53.187
I can't help you. I'm grounded
in my room for the next three days.

53:53.271 --> 53:55.314
So are we.
Our parents think we're home right now.

53:55.398 --> 53:56.398
Why are you grounded?

53:56.483 --> 53:58.734
Why? Because God hates me,
that's why.

53:58.818 --> 54:00.361
He has made my life miserable.

54:00.445 --> 54:03.072
So I call him a cock-sucking asshole
and I get grounded.

54:03.156 --> 54:05.074
- So will you help us?
- Very well.

54:05.158 --> 54:07.117
Meet me in the backyard
in five minutes.

54:08.328 --> 54:10.246
We'll show God that we're not gonna
fucking take any more...

54:10.330 --> 54:13.457
- What? Christophe, get in here!
- Coming, Mother.

54:14.626 --> 54:17.127
I must be strong. I must be strong.

54:18.171 --> 54:20.297
Saddam, I need to talk to you.

54:20.382 --> 54:21.590
You better get packing, bitch.

54:21.675 --> 54:24.093
We have to go.
We're running out of time.

54:24.177 --> 54:27.388
Saddam, sometimes you can love
a person very much,

54:27.472 --> 54:29.306
but still know that they aren't
right for you.

54:29.391 --> 54:31.100
What the fuck are you talking about?

54:31.184 --> 54:33.769
You treat me like shit, Saddam!
I'm leaving you!

54:33.853 --> 54:36.480
I'm going up to Earth to rule alone!

54:36.773 --> 54:38.565
No. No, you can't do that!

54:38.650 --> 54:42.528
- I'm sorry, but I have to be strong.
- Satan, please, give me another chance!

54:42.612 --> 54:45.739
- I have to go to Earth!
- You don't even have respect for me!

54:45.824 --> 54:48.909
Sure I do, guy. Please, just hear me out.

54:52.163 --> 54:55.374
Some people say that I'm a bad guy

54:55.458 --> 54:58.377
They may be right
They may be right

54:59.129 --> 55:02.256
But it's not as if I don't try

55:02.340 --> 55:05.342
I just fuck up, try as I might

55:05.552 --> 55:08.137
But I can change, I can change

55:08.221 --> 55:11.307
I can learn to keep my promises
I swear it

55:11.391 --> 55:16.020
I'll open up my heart and I will share it
Any minute now I will be born again

55:17.188 --> 55:19.440
Yes, I can change, I can change

55:19.524 --> 55:22.443
I know I've been a dirty little bastard

55:22.527 --> 55:23.652
I like to kill, I like to maim

55:23.737 --> 55:26.196
Yes, I'm insane, but it's okay
'cause I can change

55:27.574 --> 55:31.660
It's not my fault that I'm so evil
It's society

55:31.745 --> 55:33.120
Society

55:33.204 --> 55:36.123
You see, my parents
were sometimes abusive

55:36.207 --> 55:38.709
And it made a prick of me

55:38.793 --> 55:40.919
But I can change, I can change

55:41.004 --> 55:43.797
What if you remain
a sandy little butthole?

55:43.882 --> 55:47.259
Satan, don't be such a twit
Mother Teresa won't have shit on me

55:47.344 --> 55:48.594
Just watch
Just watch me change

55:48.678 --> 55:50.512
Here I go
I'm changing

56:13.912 --> 56:15.871
You see, I've really matured.

56:15.955 --> 56:17.998
- All right.
- All right!

56:18.083 --> 56:21.335
- Come on. We have to hurry.
- I love you.

56:25.173 --> 56:27.591
Ladies and gentlemen
of the American Army,

56:27.675 --> 56:30.302
welcome to the USO show!

56:30.804 --> 56:34.098
Get ready for loads of entertainment
and fabulous celebrities,

56:34.182 --> 56:38.060
followed immediately by the nasty
execution of Terrance and Phillip!

56:43.066 --> 56:45.234
This is the USO show
where those military bitches

56:45.318 --> 56:46.693
intend to kill Terrance and Phillip.

56:46.778 --> 56:48.570
- Oh, my God!
- God?

56:48.655 --> 56:50.364
He is the biggest bitch of them all.

56:50.448 --> 56:54.201
We have to hurry. We rendezvous
with the other kids at 10:00.

56:54.661 --> 56:56.703
You realize that by doing this,
we could be grounded for two,

56:56.788 --> 56:58.080
perhaps even three weeks.

56:58.164 --> 57:00.541
- We're willing to take that risk.
- Then let's go.

57:00.625 --> 57:03.001
And now, here are your hosts
for the evening,

57:03.086 --> 57:06.338
Sheila Broflovski and Big Gay Al!

57:09.008 --> 57:12.177
Al, tonight is a very special night,
do you know why?

57:12.262 --> 57:14.638
They're having a sale at Merv's?

57:15.014 --> 57:18.434
No, because we're going to abolish
Canadian smut!

57:18.518 --> 57:21.603
That's right, Sheila!
Bring out the condemned!

57:25.817 --> 57:28.986
Today is a great day for democracy!

57:31.197 --> 57:33.157
Phillip, this is worse than that night
I fell asleep

57:33.241 --> 57:35.325
and you put your dick in my mouth
and took a picture!

57:35.410 --> 57:36.952
I know, Terrance. I know.

57:37.036 --> 57:39.621
Well, Sheila,
while you're getting set up over there,

57:39.706 --> 57:44.126
let's bring out our first act,
Yippie the back-fiipping dog!

57:56.556 --> 57:59.057
Be careful not to touch this wire.

57:59.684 --> 58:01.226
Motherfucker...

58:01.519 --> 58:02.728
Fuck...

58:08.401 --> 58:11.904
Shit, the USO show has started!
We are running out of time!

58:11.988 --> 58:13.322
Do you see Terrance and Phillip?

58:13.406 --> 58:14.823
Yes, but they are heavily guarded.

58:15.992 --> 58:17.868
We have to dig from here
so as not to be seen.

58:17.952 --> 58:19.036
Come on, bitches.

58:20.830 --> 58:22.873
Hey, Mole,
do you know where the clitoris is?

58:22.957 --> 58:24.082
- The what?
- The clitoris.

58:24.167 --> 58:26.710
I have to find the clitoris so I can
get this Wendy girl to like me again.

58:26.794 --> 58:28.504
You need to stop thinking
with your dick!

58:28.588 --> 58:29.630
You have to be on your toes

58:29.714 --> 58:31.173
because I am not going to be
grounded again!

58:31.257 --> 58:32.925
Not for you. Not for anybody.

58:33.343 --> 58:36.178
Men, when you're out there
in the battlefield

58:36.262 --> 58:38.680
and you're looking into the beady eyes
of a Canadian

58:38.765 --> 58:41.725
as he charges you with his hockey stick
or whatever he has

58:41.809 --> 58:43.894
and people are dying all around you,

58:43.978 --> 58:46.480
just remember what the M.P.A.A. Says.

58:46.564 --> 58:49.358
"Horrific, deplorable violence is okay,

58:49.442 --> 58:52.194
"as long as people don't say
any naughty words!"

58:52.278 --> 58:55.113
That is what this war is all about!

58:56.741 --> 58:57.824
What?

59:00.078 --> 59:01.203
Shit!

59:03.248 --> 59:04.706
Move, move!

59:05.959 --> 59:09.461
Okay. We will split up here.
Let's synchronize watches.

59:09.879 --> 59:11.713
- We don't have watches.
- You don't have watches?

59:11.798 --> 59:12.881
Dude, you didn't say
anything about watches!

59:12.966 --> 59:14.091
What do you think this is, kid?

59:14.175 --> 59:15.551
TV kiddie-hour where we all sit around

59:15.635 --> 59:17.678
and lick Barney
the dinosaur's fucking pussy, huh?

59:17.762 --> 59:19.763
This is real life, with consequences
you take to the grave!

59:19.847 --> 59:22.641
- Dude, we don't have watches.
- Shit! Did you bring the mirror?

59:22.725 --> 59:23.725
- Got it!
- And the rope?

59:23.810 --> 59:25.435
- Check.
- And the buttfor?

59:25.520 --> 59:28.230
- What's a buttfor?
- For pooping, silly.

59:30.233 --> 59:32.401
Now, listen carefully.
I will dig under the stage,

59:32.485 --> 59:33.944
and with that bedrock,
I will need more time.

59:34.028 --> 59:36.738
Stan and Kyle, get near that stage
and stall the show any way you can.

59:36.823 --> 59:38.156
Do whatever it takes
to keep that show going

59:38.241 --> 59:39.950
- until I get to the prisoners.
- Okay.

59:40.034 --> 59:41.952
Cartman,
over there is the electrical box.

59:42.036 --> 59:43.453
You must sneak over there
and shut it off

59:43.538 --> 59:44.913
before I return with Terrance and Phillip

59:44.998 --> 59:47.499
or the alarms will sound
and I will be attacked by guard dogs.

59:47.584 --> 59:48.834
- Got it?
- Okay.

59:48.918 --> 59:51.378
You must shut off the alarms!
I fucking hate guard dogs!

59:51.462 --> 59:53.922
I heard you the first time,
you British piece of shit.

59:54.007 --> 59:56.758
If anything goes wrong,
make a sound like a dying giraffe.

59:56.843 --> 59:59.303
What's a dying giraffe sound like?

01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:03.515
- Okay.
- Let's go.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.183
- Be careful, dude.
- Careful?

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.477
Was my mother careful
when she stabbed me in the heart

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:10.856
with a clothes hanger
while I was still in the womb?

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.445
Damn, dude. That kid is fucked up.

01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:20.324
- How are those chairs coming, Sheila?
- Al, we're minutes away.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:22.409
Super! In the meantime,

01:00:22.493 --> 01:00:28.165
here's pint-size pixie and darling of
the indie movie scene, Winona Ryder!

01:00:28.374 --> 01:00:29.708
Hi, guys.

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:32.336
I'm super psyched to be here today.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.714
What you're doing
for our country is so cool.

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:40.427
I mean war, man. Wow. War, you know?

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:42.137
Wow.

01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:46.933
Okay! And now for your enjoyment,
here's my famous ping-pong ball trick!

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:56.568
Oh, my!

01:00:57.362 --> 01:01:01.448
"Shut off the power, Cartman.
This is very important, Cartman."

01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:03.325
Dude, did you hear
what Winona Ryder's doing?

01:01:03.409 --> 01:01:05.202
We can't miss this.

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.582
There, I didn't miss one!

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.959
That's my ping-pong ball trick!

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:19.508
Well, that's all the acts
we have for you tonight,

01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:22.302
so let's just get on with the execution!

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:25.681
- Oh, no. We have to stall him.
- More! More!

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:27.224
Yeah, more!

01:01:27.308 --> 01:01:30.185
You big sillies!
You want to see more of me?

01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:32.521
Yeah! Big Gay Al! Big Gay Al!

01:01:32.605 --> 01:01:34.648
Big Gay Al! Big Gay Al!

01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:38.193
Well, I do have a little song
I wrote about the war.

01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:40.028
But we haven't rehearsed.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:42.114
- Sing it!
- Yeah, sing it!

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:45.033
- I can't.
- Sing the fucking song!

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.869
Well, all right, if you insist,
I'll sing my song.

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:50.414
I believe it goes a little bit like this.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:56.712
Bombs are flying
People are dying

01:01:56.879 --> 01:02:00.257
Children are crying
Politicians are lying, too

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:05.262
Cancer is killing
Texaco's spilling

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:09.266
The whole world's gone to hell
But how are you?

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.728
I'm super, thanks for asking

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:15.981
All things considered
I couldn't be better, I must say

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:19.443
I'm feeling super
No, nothing bugs me

01:02:19.777 --> 01:02:24.489
Everything is super when you're...
Don't you think I look cute in this hat?

01:02:25.616 --> 01:02:28.493
I'm so sorry, Mr. Cripple

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:31.872
But I just can't feel too bad
for you right now

01:02:31.956 --> 01:02:34.916
Because I'm feeling
so insanely super

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:38.295
That even the fact that you can't walk
can't bring me down

01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:41.298
He's super, thanks for asking

01:02:41.382 --> 01:02:44.593
All things considered
he couldn't be better, he must say

01:02:44.677 --> 01:02:47.512
I'm super
No, nothing bugs me

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:51.600
Everything is super when you're...
Don't you think I look cute in this hat?

01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:54.144
These little pants
this matching tie that I got at Merv's

01:02:54.228 --> 01:02:55.228
I'm super

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:57.063
In the barracks
and the trenches as well

01:02:57.148 --> 01:02:58.982
- Stick 'em up!
- Big Gay Al says

01:02:59.066 --> 01:03:01.026
- "Do ask, do tell"
- Skittles

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:03.361
Yes, he's super
and he's proud to be gay

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:04.446
Okay?

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:09.326
Everything is super when you're gay

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:13.580
When you're gay!

01:03:15.249 --> 01:03:16.708
Again! Again!

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:26.885
Who's there?

01:03:28.012 --> 01:03:29.888
Son of a gun! Heck!

01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.265
They're coming?

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:35.310
But our moms won't listen to us!

01:03:40.858 --> 01:03:43.109
Okay, everybody,
just wanna take a minute here

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:46.404
to thank all our wonderful sponsors
we had tonight on this USO show.

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:47.656
He's almost got them.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:48.782
We are here to rescue you.

01:03:48.866 --> 01:03:50.700
After I release you,
follow me through the tunnel.

01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:52.118
- You guys! Seriously!
- What, Cartman?

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:53.495
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!

01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:56.081
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?

01:03:56.749 --> 01:03:57.999
Cartman?

01:03:58.417 --> 01:03:59.709
Shit!

01:04:01.754 --> 01:04:04.381
Hey, did you hear that?
Sounds like a giraffe is dying over there.

01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:07.175
- Shit!
- A spy!

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.510
Get him!

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.012
Shit! Shit!

01:04:12.139 --> 01:04:13.348
Oh, no!

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.351
Come on, Mole, come on!

01:04:16.435 --> 01:04:19.437
Shit! Shit! Fucking guard dogs! Shit!

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:21.398
The alarms, they went off.

01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:23.441
Yeah, that was my bad. Sorry.

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:25.902
Hold me. It's so very cold.

01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:27.863
There is no hope now.
You must get out of here.

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:30.073
- We can't leave without you!
- It's okay, I'm done for.

01:04:30.157 --> 01:04:32.576
No, we can't leave without you!
We don't know where the hell we are!

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.870
Where is your God
when you need him, huh?

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:38.290
Where is your beautiful,
merciful faggot now?

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:41.334
Here I come, God.
Here I come, you fucking rat.

01:04:41.419 --> 01:04:44.170
Now the light, she fades

01:04:44.255 --> 01:04:46.631
And darkness settles in

01:04:47.466 --> 01:04:49.259
But I will find strength

01:04:49.343 --> 01:04:50.343
No, Mole. Hang on.

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:52.220
I will find pride within

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:53.346
We'll get you home.

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:55.015
Because although I die

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:56.182
I can't face my mother.

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:57.976
Our freedom will be won

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.311
Not alone.

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:01.104
Though I die

01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:05.692
La Résistance lives on

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:19.122
Shit!

01:05:19.206 --> 01:05:22.083
Okay, folks, here it is,
the moment we've all been waiting for,

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:23.752
the execution!

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:30.342
The day is ours!

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:32.886
Oh, no, dude, it's happening!

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:34.596
We have to tell them
about Saddam Hussein and Satan!

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.306
No way, dude!
My mom can't see me here!

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:38.642
Kyle, you have to stand up
to your mother! Come on!

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:41.728
Gentlemen, do you have any last words?

01:05:41.812 --> 01:05:44.064
Last words? Let's see. How's aboot...

01:05:44.148 --> 01:05:46.775
Get me the fuck out of this chair!
How's that for last words?

01:05:46.859 --> 01:05:49.653
All right, anonymous, ready the switch.

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.697
- Wait!
- Stanley!

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.366
- Eric!
- Kyle!

01:05:55.534 --> 01:05:58.203
- Go on, dude, tell her.
- I can't.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.163
You can't kill Terrance and Phillip.

01:06:00.247 --> 01:06:04.709
If they die, Satan and Saddam Hussein
are gonna come take over the world!

01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:10.715
Throw the switch, Mr. Garrison.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.343
Hey, I'm supposed to be anonymous.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.304
Goodbye, bastards!

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:17.555
No!

01:06:24.897 --> 01:06:28.149
The Canadians are attacking!
Run for your lives!

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:31.361
Come on.
We have to shut off the power!

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.071
Fuck!

01:06:34.907 --> 01:06:37.409
Hey, some little fat kid saved us!

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:43.999
Terrance and Phillip, wait!

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:46.918
We have to get you
to the rendezvous point!

01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:51.297
Ned, behind you!

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:12.402
Be not afraid.

01:07:12.486 --> 01:07:13.570
Oh, my God!

01:07:13.654 --> 01:07:17.157
- Behold my glory.
- What are you?

01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:18.992
I am the clitoris.

01:07:19.326 --> 01:07:21.911
The clitoris? I did it! I found the clitoris!

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:24.914
Stan, you must not let
Terrance and Phillip's blood

01:07:24.999 --> 01:07:26.541
be spilled on the ground.

01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:28.543
Wait! You're supposed to tell me
how to get Wendy to like me.

01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:30.712
There are more important matters
right now.

01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:32.505
No way, dude! I looked all over for you

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.507
and now you have to tell me
how to get Wendy to like me!

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:37.343
Dude, you just have to have
confidence in yourself.

01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:40.013
Believe in yourself
and others will believe in you.

01:07:40.097 --> 01:07:43.058
Chicks love confidence. Now go, hurry!

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:44.642
The clitoris has spoken.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.228
Stan! Stan, are you okay?

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:48.688
I see you failed in your mission.

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:51.900
I should not have sent a boy
to do a man's job.

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:55.653
Come on, everyone,
we've got precious little time.

01:07:58.532 --> 01:08:00.825
Die, Canadian, m'kay?

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:07.749
- Did you hear that Terrance? I farted.
- You did? Just now?

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:09.959
Terrance and Phillip!

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:11.836
We have to get them
to the rendezvous point!

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.755
Hey, it's Mr. Garrison!

01:08:13.839 --> 01:08:16.466
Children, take Mr. Hat.

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.760
Please, get him out of here.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:23.014
Holy shit!
This V-Chip is getting all screwy!

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.015
Take cover in the trench!

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.393
All right, men! Human Shield up front,

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.479
then Operation Get Behind the Darkies.

01:08:29.563 --> 01:08:33.483
Remember, Human Shield,
protect our tanks and planes, too!

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:39.113
Holy mother of Jehoshaphat!

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:40.156
Fire on my command!

01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:42.992
All right, squad, just like I told you.

01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:46.287
One, two...

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:48.247
Yousa people gonna die?

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:49.874
- Fire!
...three!

01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:51.917
What in the...

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:56.214
- Great plan, Chef!
- Operation Human Shield, my ass!

01:08:58.716 --> 01:09:01.136
My God, this is terrible!

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.929
This is what we wanted!

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:07.308
We wanted our children to be
brought up in a smut-free environment!

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:09.602
But we didn't want this!

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:11.479
Where are you going?

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.273
We're going to find our boys!

01:09:13.357 --> 01:09:16.818
For God's sake, Sheila,
we're going to get them killed!

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.410
Kyle, all those times I said
you were a big, dumb Jew,

01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:28.037
I didn't mean it. You're not a Jew.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:30.665
Yes, I am! I am a Jew, Cartman!

01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:33.501
No, no, Kyle,
don't be so hard on yourself.

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:35.837
What the hell am I still holding this for?

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:38.131
Mr. Hat! No!

01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:41.050
Fuck this, dude. I'm getting out of here
before I get in really big trouble.

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:43.094
- I heard that.
- Stan!

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.179
Dude, I found the clitoris,

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:46.180
so now I think I can get Wendy
to like me again.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:47.473
That's swell, Stan.

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:49.058
Yeah, I guess all's well
that ends well, huh?

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:51.102
We can go home now, you dipshit!

01:09:51.937 --> 01:09:53.520
- What's wrong with this thing?
- Come on.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:57.275
We can't let Terrance and Phillip die
or else the whole world's gonna end!

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.695
- Terrance, look!
- There they are!

01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:02.530
Phillip, we're done for!

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:04.699
All right, men, fire!

01:10:04.783 --> 01:10:06.451
Goodbye, Terrance.

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:13.208
- What is this?
- Don't shoot!

01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:17.128
I'll take care of this.
Kids, get out of the way now!

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:25.887
- Kyle!
- I'm not gonna let you kill them, Mom!

01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:27.180
What? What? What?

01:10:27.264 --> 01:10:28.848
I'm not moving!

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:32.435
Stand down, children.

01:10:32.519 --> 01:10:34.687
You can still see fart jokes
on Nickelodeon.

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:37.273
No! This is about more than fart jokes!

01:10:37.358 --> 01:10:41.903
This is about freedom of speech,
about censorship and stuff.

01:10:41.987 --> 01:10:43.196
What about Ike, huh, Mom?

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.658
Did you forget that your own
adopted son is Canadian?

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:50.912
I'm doing very important things.

01:10:50.996 --> 01:10:53.581
But, Mom, you never took the time
to talk to me.

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:56.960
Whenever I get in trouble,
you go off and blame everybody else,

01:10:57.044 --> 01:10:59.462
but I'm the one to blame. Deal with me.

01:10:59.546 --> 01:11:01.965
You keep going off
and fighting all these causes,

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:05.009
but I don't want a fighter.
I want my mom.

01:11:09.306 --> 01:11:10.932
Poor little fellow.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:12.976
No!

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:14.602
Terrance!

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:19.816
- Holy shit, dude!
- Young man, you watch your mouth!

01:11:28.075 --> 01:11:30.034
My time has come!

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:32.370
You are really fucked now!

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:34.872
It's Saddam Hussein! Shoot him!

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:38.001
What a dumbass!

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.881
You have spilled
the blood of the innocent!

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:46.926
Now begins two million years
of darkness!

01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:49.345
Good job, Ms. Broflovski! Thanks a lot!

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:52.807
I was just trying to make the world
a better place for children.

01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:54.934
Yeah, and you brought
enough intolerance

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:56.644
to the world to allow my coming.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:59.647
Now, everyone bow down to me!

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:04.027
Bend over!

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.029
What have we done?

01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:08.740
Saddam, I am the dark ruler, not you.

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:11.909
Relax, bitch.
You're better seen, not heard.

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.411
I can't.

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:16.122
Let's start by building a big statue of me

01:12:16.206 --> 01:12:18.166
right over there
where that fat kid is standing.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:20.918
Hey, don't call me fat, butt-fucker!

01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:28.593
Yeah, Cartman, do it!

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:31.929
Damn! Shit!
Respect my fucking authority!

01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:34.474
Yes!

01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:37.226
Hey! You need to
watch your mouth, brat!

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:39.103
Dog shit taco!

01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:45.234
Quick, Satan, do something!

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:47.278
Try this on for size.

01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:51.115
Blood-drenched
frozen tampon Popsicle!

01:12:53.118 --> 01:12:57.622
Hey, buddy, I know I was mean before,
but don't worry, I can change.

01:12:59.124 --> 01:13:00.375
Okay.

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.002
Not!

01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:06.631
Fuck, shit, cock, ass, titties, boner,

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:09.050
bitch, muff, pussy, cock, butthole,

01:13:09.134 --> 01:13:10.885
Barbra Streisand!

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:19.060
What are you waiting for, bitch?
Destroy him.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.813
Come on, you weak,
stupid come-bucket! Save me!

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:23.398
That's it!

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:27.276
I have had enough of you!

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.489
Hey, guy, relax!

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:43.876
He spent so much time convincing me
I was weak and stupid

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:46.254
that I believed it myself.

01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:49.298
I have you to thank, little one.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:51.926
You showed me
that I had to get away from him.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:55.304
Just make any wish you want,
and I shall grant it.

01:13:58.183 --> 01:14:00.226
- Are you sure, Kenny?
- What did he say?

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:02.979
He said that his wish is for everything
to go back to the way it was

01:14:03.063 --> 01:14:04.939
before this horrible war.

01:14:05.023 --> 01:14:08.609
Kenny, you realize that means
you'd go back, too?

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:21.289
Very well, then.
I will pull all my minions back.

01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:24.667
I guess I'm destined to live in hell.
Alone.

01:14:26.378 --> 01:14:28.296
Hello. What's this?

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:33.050
Hi, there, little guy.
Would you like to go to hell with me?

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:37.472
Sure. I bet we could be
best friends, Mr. Satan.

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:40.475
Feel free to come back and visit us
any time you want, Satan.

01:14:40.559 --> 01:14:42.310
I just might do that.

01:14:42.394 --> 01:14:43.394
Thank you, Kenny.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.729
Yeah, thanks for going
back to hell for us.

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:46.647
You're a real pal.

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:52.862
Goodbye, you guys.

01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:07.376
I'm alive. Where's Mr. Hat?

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:10.087
Wow! We were all dying
and now we're fine!

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.756
That's super!

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.008
What the fuck's going on?

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:19.138
You see, Mom? After all that,

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:21.849
it was Can'tmars filthy fucking mouth
that saved us all.

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:24.977
I'm sorry I didn't pay attention
to you, Kyle.

01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:29.106
But, Wendy, what about Gregory?

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:31.025
Stan, I never really cared for Gregory.

01:15:31.109 --> 01:15:32.818
- You didn't?
- No, dude. Fuck Gregory!

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:36.197
- Fuck him right in the ear!
- Thank you, clitoris.

01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:39.867
Everything worked out
What a happy end

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:44.163
Americans and Canadians
are friends again

01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:47.208
So let's all join hands
and knock oppression down

01:15:47.292 --> 01:15:48.376
Good Lordy, I'm found

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:51.254
Don't you know our little lives
are now complete?

01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:53.422
'Cause Terrance and Phillip are sweet

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:54.799
Super sweet!

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:57.635
Thank God we live in this quiet

01:15:57.719 --> 01:16:01.222
Little, pissant, redneck
Podunk, jerkwater

01:16:01.306 --> 01:16:03.558
Greenorn, one-horse
Mudhole, peckerwood
