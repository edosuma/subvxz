WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.820
All our memory bearings from the time...

00:03.000 --> 00:04.600
were all damaged in the blackout.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.300
But there are sometimes fragments.

00:36.000 --> 00:36.500
- No.

00:37.830 --> 00:41.780
Conclusive session 11:17 p.m.

00:42.010 --> 00:46.100
Testimony of Niander Wallace to the magistrate sectors

00:46.300 --> 00:50.840
EL1 at 9 through 26 and so forth.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.100
Ended MD.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.100
Thank you

01:07.000 --> 01:08.920
for your patience.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.100
I did not intend to keep you waiting.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.980
The particulars of my affliction...

01:18.400 --> 01:20.100
make travel difficult.

01:30.600 --> 01:34.300
Mr. Wallace, we've granted you this meeting in deference to your...

01:34.400 --> 01:35.500
contributions.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.160
Your Cinch-contribution.

01:39.300 --> 01:43.500
We recognize that for the public good.
For their health.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.400
You remember hunger...

01:49.000 --> 01:54.300
So you indulge the recluse, whose patents keep that hunger at bay.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.300
I believe in life.

02:02.700 --> 02:07.200
In fact I have run more life from our Earth than ever before.

02:08.100 --> 02:12.500
But it is dying. You... are dying.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.200
Which brings us to

02:17.000 --> 02:19.200
our present concern.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.650
Prohibition?

02:26.500 --> 02:29.300
We have made clear <i>our</i> position.

02:29.500 --> 02:33.600
The prohibition of replicant technology is not subject to debate.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.600
Nor is its repeal.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.600
Yet we are debating.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.000
Not we.

02:43.600 --> 02:49.300
Of all that was lost in the blackout,
this cut of history... died along.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Humanity has only survived this long

02:53.000 --> 02:55.300
by crushing the Earth to suit its needs.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.200
The stars... our only hope

02:59.250 --> 03:02.650
are hidden beyond the lives you will not allow me to create.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.100
Off-world colonies are thriving.

03:08.100 --> 03:11.300
-Insufficient to the needs of ultimate survival.

03:11.500 --> 03:15.400
Your laws have changed the hands of progress.

03:15.700 --> 03:18.400
The laws keep blood off the streets.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.500
- Nexus phase is unreliable.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.250
Safeguards put in place by Tyrell were negligent.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.250
- Too many have died. We will not add to that number.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.400
My replicants

03:29.700 --> 03:33.450
will live as long
or as short as a customer will pay.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.200
My replicants will never rebel. 

03:36.300 --> 03:37.900
They will never run

03:38.900 --> 03:40.500
They will simply obey.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.300
Step forward.

03:48.300 --> 03:49.700
Find your weapon, do this now.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.000
For goodness sake.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.300
What is this?

04:02.800 --> 04:03.800
This,

04:05.000 --> 04:06.200
is an angel.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.600
And I made him.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Look up to the left, reveal.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.700
You're committing a crime, Wallace!

04:23.000 --> 04:24.100
Now that's enough!

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Lift the glass.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.500
Cut.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.800
No, no. No. No. No!

04:34.200 --> 04:35.000
This is wrong.

04:37.900 --> 04:38.900
Does it hurt?

04:43.600 --> 04:44.600
Yes.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.600
You must make a choice:

04:49.600 --> 04:51.900
Your life or mine.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.700
Do you understand?

04:57.600 --> 04:58.600
Yes.

05:04.800 --> 05:05.800
Do this now.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
- This is wrong.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.700
Human action

05:21.800 --> 05:24.500
resounds in the heavens.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.100
The bell echoes above

05:28.000 --> 05:30.200
what we decide here today.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.600
We'll polish or crack the firmament.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.000
Which shall it be?
