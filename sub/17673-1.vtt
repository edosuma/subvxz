00:00.346 --> 00:02.279
Look, maybe you
don't understand.

00:02.358 --> 00:03.791
I understand you
perfectly.

00:03.858 --> 00:05.824
I said no papers
signed today.

00:05.891 --> 00:08.125
Leave them, but
no papers get signed.

00:08.191 --> 00:09.325
The boss ain't going-

00:09.391 --> 00:12.757
I said no papers
get signed today!

00:13.891 --> 00:14.924
Ok.

00:19.391 --> 00:21.824
You're a tough man,
Mr. Nazerman.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.824
I mean,
he looks tough, but-

00:23.891 --> 00:26.757
Why don't you mind
your own business?

00:49.924 --> 00:51.191
You know...

00:51.258 --> 00:55.125
You worry me when you look
like that, Mr. Nazerman.

01:05.425 --> 01:08.458
What-what is wrong
with you?

01:11.258 --> 01:12.325
Hmm?

01:13.458 --> 01:14.891
I don't know.

01:14.958 --> 01:19.225
Good afternoon,
Mr. Nazerman.

01:19.291 --> 01:22.891
Mr. Nazerman,
for some days now

01:22.958 --> 01:26.824
I've been trying
to give an idea

01:26.891 --> 01:29.958
Some sort of shape,
a- a pattern.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.824
Now-now, Mr.- Mr...

01:32.891 --> 01:36.325
Socrates...
Socrates himself

01:36.391 --> 01:40.325
Was on the very borderline
of drama, right?

01:40.391 --> 01:43.891
Right, and look
at Baudelaire.

01:43.958 --> 01:47.924
Baudelaire and all his
strange, sacred mysticism.

01:47.991 --> 01:50.924
And who knows?
Perhaps the marquis de-

01:50.991 --> 01:52.425
Exactly what was it

01:52.492 --> 01:55.091
That you came to pawn,
Mr. Smith?

01:55.158 --> 01:57.757
Pawn? Oh, of course.
To pawn.

01:57.824 --> 01:59.258
I- I did bring...

01:59.325 --> 02:01.592
I... i...

02:01.657 --> 02:03.492
I had it somewhere.

02:03.558 --> 02:04.991
Just stand still.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.558
Stand still
for a minute.

02:07.624 --> 02:09.924
Now, think.

02:09.991 --> 02:12.425
Just for once
in your life,

02:12.492 --> 02:14.858
Try to be rational
and think exactly

02:14.924 --> 02:18.091
What you came
in here to pawn.

02:18.158 --> 02:19.225
I...

02:22.525 --> 02:23.558
Nothing.

02:26.358 --> 02:29.492
I had nothing to bring.

02:32.691 --> 02:33.724
I...

02:37.958 --> 02:40.657
I will miss
talking to you.

02:52.024 --> 02:54.724
What makes creatures
like that exist?

03:00.058 --> 03:03.991
Why-why did you
call him creature?

03:04.058 --> 03:05.858
Because he's black?

03:12.558 --> 03:13.991
No, not because
he's black.

03:14.058 --> 03:15.991
I don't care
what he is.

03:16.058 --> 03:17.492
I'm nondiscriminatory,
nonsectarian.

03:17.558 --> 03:20.091
Black, white, or yellow,
they're all equally...

03:20.158 --> 03:21.091
Equally what?

03:21.158 --> 03:23.091
Scum. Rejects.

03:26.791 --> 03:29.657
You're a mighty hard man,
Mr. Nazerman.

03:32.325 --> 03:33.757
I mean, after all,

03:33.824 --> 03:35.624
They are
children of god.

03:35.691 --> 03:36.791
Ain't they?

03:36.858 --> 03:41.091
You believe
in god, Ortiz?

03:41.158 --> 03:44.824
I don't know,
Mr. Nazerman.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.824
But you believe
in god,

03:46.891 --> 03:49.291
And I make book
on that.

03:49.358 --> 03:51.858
I do not
believe in god

03:51.924 --> 03:53.858
Or art or science

03:53.924 --> 03:56.991
Or newspapers or
politics or philosophy.

03:57.058 --> 04:02.858
Well, then,
Mr. Teacher...

04:02.924 --> 04:06.058
Ain't there nothing
you do believe?

04:06.125 --> 04:08.291
Money.

04:08.358 --> 04:12.492
All right.
Then you teach me

04:12.558 --> 04:14.858
About money then,
Mr. Nazerman.

04:14.924 --> 04:17.425
All right, Mr. Ortiz.

04:17.492 --> 04:18.858
Now, come here.

04:23.924 --> 04:26.858
Firstly, money can increase
or decrease in value.

04:26.924 --> 04:29.791
Secondly, money is risky,
but at a given moment,

04:29.858 --> 04:32.824
One has some idea
of its worth.

04:32.891 --> 04:35.325
Thirdly, money can
buy you many things-

04:35.391 --> 04:36.824
Comfort, luxury,
relief from pain,

04:36.891 --> 04:38.325
Sometimes
even life itself,

04:38.391 --> 04:40.824
And now you listen to me,

04:40.891 --> 04:43.691
And you listen
very carefully.

04:43.757 --> 04:45.791
Next to the speed of light,
which einstein says

04:45.858 --> 04:48.391
Is the only abSolute
in the universe,

04:48.458 --> 04:50.691
Second only to that,
i rank money!

04:54.458 --> 04:57.391
Well...

04:57.458 --> 05:00.824
You believe me, that's
all you need to know.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.724
That's what life's
all about?

05:04.791 --> 05:07.391
That's what life
is all about.

05:07.458 --> 05:11.125
You mean, money
is the whole thing?

05:11.191 --> 05:12.958
Money is
the whole thing.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.624
I'll see you later,
Mr. Nazerman.

05:49.691 --> 05:50.791
Please, please?

05:50.858 --> 05:53.525
Please, please,
listen to me.

05:55.325 --> 05:58.258
Honey, I can get you
the money.

05:58.325 --> 06:01.258
I got some gifts
i could sell.

06:01.325 --> 06:03.757
Extras from
the customers. You know.

06:03.824 --> 06:06.558
Baby, you don't
need them others...

06:07.691 --> 06:10.125
Tangee and buck,
most that Robinson-

06:10.191 --> 06:11.824
They just poison.

06:13.858 --> 06:18.791
Baby, nothing they do
for you won't hurt you.

06:18.858 --> 06:21.291
Oh, please, please,
let me chip in.

06:21.358 --> 06:24.791
I can get it for you.
I know I can.

06:24.858 --> 06:28.791
Money. Money.

06:28.858 --> 06:30.225
That's the whole thing.

06:30.291 --> 06:31.391
Sure.

06:31.458 --> 06:36.225
Sure, honey, only no going
back to them others.

06:36.291 --> 06:38.058
Oh, baby...

06:38.125 --> 06:40.558
I'm just
thinkin' of you.

06:40.624 --> 06:43.058
Damn loot.
I'm going to get it.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.058
I'm going to get it
and fast!

07:02.525 --> 07:06.891
Chico! Come. Sit.

07:14.891 --> 07:17.757
How come you don't
join with us?

07:19.158 --> 07:21.858
I got some
thinking to do.

07:21.924 --> 07:23.791
Oh?

07:38.358 --> 07:39.791
You know what I think?

07:39.858 --> 07:42.791
I think you got
something on your mind

07:42.858 --> 07:44.358
You want to talk about,

07:44.425 --> 07:47.657
Or you wouldn't be here
in the first place.

07:47.724 --> 07:51.358
You want I should romance you
a little before you talk.

07:51.425 --> 07:53.391
Listen, you hear me,
tangee.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.391
I got nothing to say,
see?

07:55.458 --> 07:57.391
I just got to think.

07:57.458 --> 08:00.558
I just got a lot
of thinking to do.

08:00.624 --> 08:02.391
All right.

08:02.458 --> 08:04.325
Ain't nobody
pressuring you.

08:06.991 --> 08:08.657
And if-

08:08.724 --> 08:11.291
If I decide to do
anything at all,

08:11.358 --> 08:13.991
<i>I got to
call the moves.</i>

08:14.058 --> 08:16.624
We had you figured
for that.

08:16.691 --> 08:19.291
And if the thing goes,

08:19.358 --> 08:20.791
<i>I say if...</i>

08:20.858 --> 08:23.225
There'll be no shooting.

08:23.291 --> 08:24.624
Ok, man.

08:24.691 --> 08:27.358
You need a piece,
but just for show,

08:27.425 --> 08:29.991
Because shooting
is trouble. It's stupid.

08:30.058 --> 08:32.624
We can do without it.

08:32.691 --> 08:34.058
No matter what,
understand?

08:40.424 --> 08:43.357
If I decide
to go ahead with it,

08:43.424 --> 08:44.592
<i>If...</i>

08:44.657 --> 08:46.924
<i>I say when and how.</i>

08:46.991 --> 08:49.024
If.

09:06.492 --> 09:09.125
I got some stuff
to pawn.

09:21.958 --> 09:24.258
We'll start off
with this.

09:24.325 --> 09:25.757
That's an expensive locket.

09:25.824 --> 09:29.258
No sense in fooling
around with it. It's gold.

09:29.325 --> 09:31.691
I'll give you
$20 for it.

09:31.757 --> 09:33.724
$20? It's worth
at least 100.

09:33.791 --> 09:36.225
Maybe it is,
but not to me.

09:36.291 --> 09:38.724
This locket was
a present, a gift

09:38.791 --> 09:41.225
From a man for
a private session.

09:41.291 --> 09:45.291
Pawnbroker... you got it
in your power

09:45.358 --> 09:48.225
To make me a beat up
old woman.

09:49.858 --> 09:51.724
What makes you say that?

09:53.358 --> 09:55.291
'Cause if my boss
finds out

09:55.358 --> 09:58.225
I've been messing around
in private-

09:58.291 --> 10:01.291
He don't hold still
for nothing like that,

10:01.358 --> 10:04.791
So if it was
to get out to him,

10:04.858 --> 10:08.525
He'd make me old
before my time.

10:15.391 --> 10:16.624
Hello.

10:16.691 --> 10:20.558
Mendel is dead.

10:20.624 --> 10:22.924
My father's dead.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.258
Did you hear
what I just said?

10:29.391 --> 10:31.757
Yeah, I heard
what you said, yeah.

10:31.824 --> 10:34.425
Uh...

10:34.492 --> 10:35.924
Just a minute.

10:47.924 --> 10:50.291
Hang that up,
would you, please?

10:53.291 --> 10:54.258
Hello.

10:54.325 --> 10:58.858
Papa is dead.

10:58.924 --> 11:01.458
What am I going
to do, Sol?

11:02.924 --> 11:04.358
Well, you bury him.

11:04.425 --> 11:06.358
There's nothing else
to do.

11:06.425 --> 11:07.525
Nothing?

11:07.592 --> 11:09.325
Nothing. Nothing.

11:10.624 --> 11:13.824
When you talk like that,
you're not human.

11:13.891 --> 11:16.492
You want me to come
cry with you?

11:16.558 --> 11:17.492
Yes.

11:17.558 --> 11:18.757
The hell
with your crying.

11:21.824 --> 11:23.924
I need someone
to help me.

11:23.991 --> 11:26.358
I can't come now.
I can't leave the store.

11:26.425 --> 11:28.624
The store.

11:28.691 --> 11:32.358
Big... important... store.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.558
Where do you think
your money comes from?

11:34.624 --> 11:35.791
You wouldn't get
your father's corpse

11:35.858 --> 11:40.391
Into the ground
if not for the store.

11:40.458 --> 11:45.592
Papa is dead.

11:45.691 --> 11:48.024
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?

12:04.858 --> 12:06.724
I'm good, pawnbroker.

12:09.358 --> 12:10.724
I'm real good.

12:12.358 --> 12:16.225
I know things you haven't
never even dreamed about.

12:19.891 --> 12:24.492
Just $20 more.

12:24.558 --> 12:26.325
I make you happy.

12:26.391 --> 12:28.492
Like you've
never known.

12:32.824 --> 12:35.191
I'll show you
how pretty I am.

12:44.325 --> 12:47.325
Don't you say nothin'
about this, you hear?

12:47.391 --> 12:50.325
Nothin'. Like I said,

12:50.391 --> 12:52.058
If my boss
was to find out

12:52.125 --> 12:54.492
I been messin' around
in private...

12:54.558 --> 12:56.492
So don't tell
Rodriguez nothin'.

12:56.558 --> 12:57.824
Rodriguez?

12:57.891 --> 13:00.858
Rodriguez...
the big man...

13:00.924 --> 13:03.024
The boss.

13:03.091 --> 13:04.924
The biggest in Harlem.

13:06.058 --> 13:08.691
You mean...

13:08.757 --> 13:10.858
You work for Rodriguez?

13:12.091 --> 13:13.558
Oh, yeah.

13:13.624 --> 13:17.058
Oh, he's got lots
of irons in the fire.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.858
He's a powerful man,

13:18.924 --> 13:22.291
So it's better if you
don't tell him a thing.

13:24.258 --> 13:27.158
But I got to get me
some money.

13:29.891 --> 13:30.958
Look.

13:33.958 --> 13:34.824
Look.

13:36.858 --> 13:40.125
That's it. Look.

13:47.358 --> 13:48.225
Look.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.258
Look.

15:29.391 --> 15:33.425
That's it. Look!

15:36.425 --> 15:38.358
It don't cost you
nothin' to look.

15:44.492 --> 15:48.158
That's it. Just look.

15:50.924 --> 15:52.024
Look.

16:02.425 --> 16:03.425
Look.

16:44.958 --> 16:46.691
Aah!

16:48.492 --> 16:50.425
I can't tell you,
Nazerman,

16:50.492 --> 16:52.924
How I've looked
forward to this.

16:52.991 --> 16:56.158
People I come
in contact with...

16:57.458 --> 16:58.824
They're dumbheads.

17:00.425 --> 17:04.425
You've got background.
The real thing.

17:04.492 --> 17:07.924
Me, I never had
a regular education,

17:07.991 --> 17:10.924
But I've got
a feel for things.

17:10.991 --> 17:12.924
You...

17:12.991 --> 17:15.891
Are a welcome
change of pace for me.

17:23.023 --> 17:24.125
Say...

17:24.191 --> 17:27.624
If all you wanted was
to come here and stare,

17:27.691 --> 17:29.991
I could've
sent you a picture.

17:43.791 --> 17:46.458
Ok, partner...

17:46.525 --> 17:48.624
What's your beef?

17:48.691 --> 17:50.225
That whorehouse down
the street from me-

17:50.291 --> 17:51.724
Do you own it?

17:51.791 --> 17:53.558
You wouldn't be
trying to get-

17:53.624 --> 17:56.258
It's your whorehouse,
isn't it?

17:56.325 --> 17:58.191
Assume it is,
then what?

17:58.258 --> 18:00.891
I don't want your money
if it's from there.

18:00.958 --> 18:02.425
Say that again.

18:02.492 --> 18:05.558
I don't want your money
if it's from there.

18:05.624 --> 18:06.924
Why?

18:06.991 --> 18:09.891
It's money that comes
from filth and horror!

18:09.958 --> 18:12.425
That's what it is,
professor.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.757
Then...

18:14.824 --> 18:17.924
We can have no longer
anything to do further-

18:17.991 --> 18:20.258
Professor...

18:20.325 --> 18:23.592
You don't know it,
but the lecture is over.

18:23.657 --> 18:26.091
Now, you're going
to listen to me.

18:26.158 --> 18:27.624
Where do you
think the money

18:27.691 --> 18:30.225
You've been living on
comes from, professor?

18:30.291 --> 18:32.624
Money you pay for
an old jew's keep,

18:32.691 --> 18:34.191
Money you give Tessie.

18:34.258 --> 18:36.757
Money you pay for a nice,
fat house on long island

18:36.824 --> 18:39.592
And the nice, fat family
you support there?

18:39.657 --> 18:42.358
Oh, I know
all about you.

18:42.425 --> 18:44.558
And how. I know where
your money comes from-

18:44.624 --> 18:46.791
From me.

18:46.858 --> 18:49.791
And one of the places
i get it most

18:49.858 --> 18:51.158
Is from whorehouses

18:51.225 --> 18:53.525
And bowling alleys
and parking lots

18:53.592 --> 18:56.125
And hotel linens
and tenements.

18:56.191 --> 18:59.891
Now tell me where you thought
it was coming from.

19:12.492 --> 19:14.624
I don't know.

19:14.691 --> 19:17.724
That makes you stupid,
professor.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.391
You're living right in it!

19:19.458 --> 19:21.225
Right in the middle of
one big whorehouse,

19:21.291 --> 19:23.158
Right in the bosom
of the world!

19:23.225 --> 19:25.924
How do you say it-
Filth, horror?

19:25.991 --> 19:29.425
Right in the middle
and you don't know it.

19:29.492 --> 19:32.425
Or maybe something else-
Because you don't want to know.

19:32.492 --> 19:35.191
Are you that kind of man,
professor,

19:35.258 --> 19:36.691
That doesn't want
to know about things,

19:36.757 --> 19:40.225
Feel about things?
Are you that kind?

19:40.291 --> 19:44.358
That makes you nothing!
A ton of nothing!

19:47.358 --> 19:50.791
You give me a front,
and I give you money,

19:50.858 --> 19:54.425
So don't hang up on me,
professor.

19:54.492 --> 19:56.158
Not again.

19:57.991 --> 20:00.425
Look at me.

20:00.492 --> 20:03.391
Look at me!

20:03.458 --> 20:05.091
I said...

20:39.791 --> 20:42.225
Those papers
you haven't signed...

20:42.291 --> 20:44.691
By tomorrow morning,
signed.

20:51.325 --> 20:52.824
What?

20:58.858 --> 20:59.991
Yes.

21:00.058 --> 21:01.258
Yes?

21:04.225 --> 21:05.325
Yes.

21:05.391 --> 21:06.492
Yes?

21:10.824 --> 21:12.058
Yes?

21:16.624 --> 21:17.958
Yes.

21:18.024 --> 21:19.058
Yes?

21:27.824 --> 21:30.024
Yes.

21:30.091 --> 21:32.858
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

21:32.924 --> 21:34.458
Oh, yes.

21:47.358 --> 21:49.225
Happy dreams, uncle.

25:17.525 --> 25:18.657
Come in.

25:49.091 --> 25:50.858
Can I get you
something?

25:56.924 --> 25:58.724
Coffee?

25:58.791 --> 26:02.525
No, I thank you. No.

26:02.592 --> 26:05.525
I was out on the terrace
when you phoned.

26:05.592 --> 26:07.024
I couldn't sleep.

26:16.125 --> 26:17.225
Would you...

26:17.291 --> 26:20.058
It's very lovely
in the morning.

26:21.858 --> 26:25.258
That's why
i got this apartment-

26:25.325 --> 26:26.791
This terrace.

26:29.458 --> 26:32.558
The city
and the river.

27:11.391 --> 27:15.824
We had a...

27:15.891 --> 27:18.158
We had a river
in Germany.

27:19.624 --> 27:21.125
Tell me about it.

27:23.757 --> 27:26.291
That was long ago.
That was...

27:28.924 --> 27:35.125
That was before Europe
became a graveyard.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.791
What made you come here?

27:44.358 --> 27:46.757
I don't know.
I don't know.

27:46.824 --> 27:47.858
Just...

27:49.991 --> 27:51.924
Things have been
happening lately,

27:51.991 --> 27:54.058
And...

27:54.125 --> 27:57.425
I felt I needed
to be with someone.

27:59.458 --> 28:01.724
What things,
Mr. Nazerman?

28:02.958 --> 28:06.891
Well, it's just
that suddenly,

28:06.958 --> 28:10.492
In the last few days,
i feel afraid, and...

28:15.958 --> 28:20.824
It's been a long time
since I felt...

28:20.891 --> 28:22.425
Anything.

28:22.492 --> 28:23.592
Fear.

28:27.358 --> 28:29.924
Fear, fear.
That's what I felt.

28:34.291 --> 28:35.958
And then i, uh...

28:38.791 --> 28:40.458
I called you.

28:42.657 --> 28:45.891
I'm sorry that
you're so alone.

28:47.358 --> 28:49.791
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

28:49.858 --> 28:52.791
It's just that there
have been memories

28:52.858 --> 28:54.291
That I have...

28:54.358 --> 28:56.791
Well, I thought
that I had...

28:56.858 --> 28:59.291
Pushed them
far away from me,

28:59.358 --> 29:02.191
And they keep
rushing in...

29:02.258 --> 29:04.592
And then
there are words...

29:06.891 --> 29:10.824
Words that I thought I have
kept myself from hearing

29:10.891 --> 29:13.824
And... now...

29:13.891 --> 29:17.691
Now they...

29:17.757 --> 29:20.724
Flood my mind.

29:25.558 --> 29:26.757
Yeah.

29:29.391 --> 29:31.391
Today is an anniversary.

29:34.058 --> 29:35.891
What happened?

29:35.958 --> 29:37.058
Happened?

29:37.125 --> 29:38.391
Yes.

29:41.291 --> 29:42.757
I didn't die.

29:45.458 --> 29:47.391
Everything
that I loved...

29:51.358 --> 29:53.724
Was taken away
from me and...

29:55.691 --> 29:57.592
I did not die.

30:00.358 --> 30:02.391
Mr. Nazerman...

30:02.458 --> 30:03.558
There was...

30:05.525 --> 30:07.858
Nothing I could do.

30:09.891 --> 30:10.924
Ha.

30:14.891 --> 30:15.991
Nothing.

30:17.691 --> 30:19.757
Strange?
I could do nothing.

30:21.058 --> 30:24.592
No, there was nothing
i could do.

31:40.624 --> 31:42.757
Why do you
sit like that?

31:45.325 --> 31:47.258
I got... chilled.

31:53.024 --> 31:55.724
I got chilled
listening to you...

31:59.358 --> 32:02.724
And not being able
to do anything for you.

35:01.824 --> 35:02.958
Sol!

35:03.024 --> 35:05.158
Sol, don't
let him fall!

35:05.225 --> 35:08.791
David?
Sol, he's falling!

35:08.858 --> 35:10.724
Oh, god, David!

35:10.791 --> 35:12.858
Sol! Sol!

35:12.924 --> 35:15.991
Ruthie!
I can't do anything!

35:16.058 --> 35:20.891
Oh, my god,
i can't do nothing.

35:46.225 --> 35:49.058
<i>David. David!</i>

35:49.125 --> 35:53.858
<i>David! David!</i>

36:47.691 --> 36:48.824
Mr. Nazerman.

36:51.724 --> 36:55.325
Mr. Nazerman.
Are you all right?

36:56.657 --> 36:59.325
You-you don't
look good.

37:07.958 --> 37:09.958
Listen, i...

37:10.024 --> 37:12.158
I- is there
anything I can...

38:14.958 --> 38:16.558
Mr. Nazerman.

38:21.158 --> 38:22.558
Do you remember me?

38:29.824 --> 38:31.757
The Oratory Award.

38:35.592 --> 38:38.525
Just to carry me over
until i...

38:38.592 --> 38:41.191
Well... I have this
for you.

38:47.724 --> 38:49.458
Don't scratch them.

38:54.624 --> 38:57.592
They're surely
worth $10.

39:09.757 --> 39:11.991
$50.

39:13.492 --> 39:14.425
$2.00.

39:14.492 --> 39:15.425
You're crazy.

39:15.492 --> 39:16.924
$2.00 for
a leica camera?

39:16.991 --> 39:18.924
What the hell
are you saying?

39:18.991 --> 39:20.425
$1.00.
That's better?

39:20.492 --> 39:22.858
You're out of
your mind for sure.

39:25.891 --> 39:28.624
Whatever you
want to give.

39:28.691 --> 39:31.091
I've got no use
for them anymore.

39:31.158 --> 39:33.592
How much do you
want to borrow?

39:33.657 --> 39:36.191
Oh, I-I don't know.

39:36.258 --> 39:38.191
$20?

39:38.258 --> 39:39.358
$50.

39:40.824 --> 39:43.258
I'll let you
have it for $2.00.

39:43.325 --> 39:45.757
Why, yes, I'll just
take that watch.

39:45.824 --> 39:48.691
Now, just
wait a minute.

39:48.757 --> 39:50.058
This says, uh...

39:50.125 --> 39:53.024
It says
121/2 bucks, lady.

39:53.091 --> 39:56.024
You got a mouth, boy.
Pawnbroker says-

39:56.091 --> 39:58.024
I don't care.
You want this article,

39:58.091 --> 40:01.958
You come up with $12.50.
That's what the sign say.

40:07.024 --> 40:08.458
Mr. Nazerman.

40:11.391 --> 40:15.657
Mr. Nazerman,
are you ok? Huh?

40:15.724 --> 40:17.358
Leave me alone,
Ortiz.

40:17.425 --> 40:19.858
Ok, I'll do that,
Mr. Nazerman.

40:19.924 --> 40:22.858
I'll do that.
First I want to know,

40:22.924 --> 40:24.358
Are you ok?

40:24.425 --> 40:26.091
I'm ok.

40:26.158 --> 40:27.592
Are you sure?

40:27.657 --> 40:29.592
Yes, I'm sure!
I'm ok.

40:29.657 --> 40:31.024
Now just
leave me alone.

40:31.091 --> 40:32.525
That's all right.

40:32.592 --> 40:34.525
I'm just concerned,
that's all.

40:34.592 --> 40:37.225
After all,
you're my teacher.

40:39.024 --> 40:43.525
Ha.
I'm your what?

40:43.592 --> 40:45.824
You're my teacher.

40:45.891 --> 40:47.091
Hmm.

40:47.158 --> 40:49.492
I'm a student to you.

40:49.558 --> 40:51.824
You're
nothing to me.

40:56.158 --> 40:57.091
For true?

40:57.158 --> 40:58.091
For true.

40:58.158 --> 41:00.058
You mean, I'm like...

41:00.125 --> 41:02.058
The rest of them
out there?

41:02.125 --> 41:03.225
That's right.

41:03.291 --> 41:05.724
You're like the rest
of them out there.

41:05.791 --> 41:07.158
You're nothing to me.

41:10.325 --> 41:11.757
I'll go for lunch now.

41:11.824 --> 41:14.258
Go to lunch.
Do what you please,

41:14.325 --> 41:16.225
But just leave me alone.
Now, go!

41:24.391 --> 41:25.757
See you later.

42:56.958 --> 42:58.558
It's at
closing time.

42:58.624 --> 42:59.558
Hmm?

42:59.624 --> 43:02.191
I said it's
at closing time.

43:02.258 --> 43:03.757
How come?

43:06.058 --> 43:08.492
That's when
it's got to be.

43:08.558 --> 43:09.991
Now I said it,

43:10.058 --> 43:12.325
And I'm
saying it again.

43:12.391 --> 43:14.492
No shootin'.

43:14.558 --> 43:15.991
What's the matter,

43:16.058 --> 43:19.024
You worried
about the jew?

43:19.091 --> 43:20.724
No.

43:20.791 --> 43:25.291
I'm worrying about
Jesus Ortiz.

43:25.358 --> 43:28.924
Now...

43:28.991 --> 43:30.425
I got a plan.

44:35.624 --> 44:38.058
Then this jive cop,
he said,

44:38.125 --> 44:39.558
"Mon,
I'm sympathetic

44:39.624 --> 44:41.991
To the problems
of your race."

44:51.592 --> 44:54.525
You were supposed to deliver
the papers this morning.

44:54.592 --> 44:56.091
They better be signed.

45:12.225 --> 45:13.325
Sign them.

45:34.391 --> 45:36.757
And if I don't
sign the papers...

45:38.691 --> 45:41.492
What do you do to me
then, you kill me?

45:41.558 --> 45:43.592
Oh, yes.

45:44.891 --> 45:46.891
So kill me.

45:48.657 --> 45:50.058
Pardon me, uncle.

46:24.191 --> 46:25.757
Professor...

46:29.125 --> 46:32.125
You have to kill me.

46:35.592 --> 46:37.325
That's what you want.

46:41.391 --> 46:44.824
That's what you really want,
professor, isn't it?

46:47.225 --> 46:48.691
I'll tell you what.

46:48.757 --> 46:50.425
You'll die...

46:51.991 --> 46:54.791
But not when
you want to.

46:54.858 --> 46:57.924
Not when you
want to so bad.

46:59.558 --> 47:01.558
One day it'll
happen to you...

47:03.091 --> 47:05.458
Just the time when
you wish it hadn't.

47:43.125 --> 47:46.657
I'd like to borrow
some money on this.

47:48.125 --> 47:51.757
I- I want to borrow
$10 on this.

47:51.824 --> 47:53.924
I collect them.

47:53.991 --> 47:56.458
You'd be surprised
how many people

47:56.525 --> 47:58.058
Use them for decoration.

48:00.125 --> 48:05.691
There's a monarch
in here.

48:05.757 --> 48:09.358
And the great spangle
fritillary.

48:11.358 --> 48:12.724
The mourning cloak...

48:13.958 --> 48:15.458
And...

48:15.525 --> 48:19.724
The one with
the eye design, tha-

48:28.425 --> 48:29.391
Thank you.

51:21.425 --> 51:23.657
Well, gentlemen,
what do you want?

51:23.724 --> 51:25.724
The money.

51:27.258 --> 51:28.691
The money.

51:30.492 --> 51:32.325
Now, we ain't playin'.

51:33.525 --> 51:35.824
Now you open
that safe fast.

51:35.891 --> 51:38.091
Well, come on!

51:39.225 --> 51:40.458
Well, come on!

51:52.425 --> 51:53.724
Look...

51:56.258 --> 51:57.924
Go home.

51:59.191 --> 52:00.824
We ain't jokin', mister.

52:00.891 --> 52:03.592
You get that money
out of that safe.

52:03.657 --> 52:04.858
You get it.

52:04.924 --> 52:06.824
Hey, no sweat.
It's open.

52:08.258 --> 52:09.958
Step aside, uncle.

52:18.724 --> 52:21.091
What do you want
to die for, uncle?

52:21.158 --> 52:25.358
The money don't mean
that much to you, does it?

52:29.425 --> 52:33.358
Now... you move.

52:35.125 --> 52:37.225
