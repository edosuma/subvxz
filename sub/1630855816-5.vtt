WEBVTT

00:14.314 --> 00:19.319
(upbeat music)

00:54.220 --> 00:55.989
(whistle screeches, music stops)

00:55.989 --> 00:57.223
(Shoresy): Everybody,
listen up, here!

00:57.223 --> 00:58.958
Let's listen up here now.

01:00.660 --> 01:01.895
Yeah so,

01:01.895 --> 01:03.596
even though they've been
real poopy lately

01:03.596 --> 01:05.532
over the Reach For The Top team...

01:05.532 --> 01:07.067
(Hitch): B'ys had poopy
diapers luh.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.968
Just a big,
hot dump in there.

01:08.968 --> 01:10.703
The Jims have slingshot back

01:10.703 --> 01:13.573
in a way I think we can
all agree is pretty good.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.175
- You probably thought that--
- What's my favourite

01:15.175 --> 01:16.142
No Doubt song, Fish?

01:16.142 --> 01:17.644
- Sunday Morning.
- Don't Speak.

01:17.644 --> 01:18.978
You probably thought
when you dragged MacPherson

01:18.978 --> 01:20.547
over to the bench,
that the Jims would just

01:20.547 --> 01:22.048
pop him a couple of times,
hey, my guy?

01:22.048 --> 01:23.950
I thought they'd just pop him
a few times, Sanguinet.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.585
- Yeah, and then--
- Shut the fuck up, Michaels.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.487
And then, they pulled him
right into the bench.

01:27.487 --> 01:28.721
(speaking French)

01:28.721 --> 01:30.990
- Right into the pine.
- In a way I think we can

01:30.990 --> 01:32.759
all agree it was pretty good.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.960
Unbelievable.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.029
- Yeah, so Jim?
- Yeah?

01:36.029 --> 01:37.197
- Jim?
- Yes?

01:37.197 --> 01:38.765
- Jim?
- Chapman's really makes

01:38.765 --> 01:41.968
the superior stick, eh?
- The game sticks go to you.

01:41.968 --> 01:43.336
(players clap)
- Hey.

01:43.336 --> 01:44.771
But... but...

01:47.140 --> 01:49.909
Yeah so, Michaels
for backstopping us

01:49.909 --> 01:51.177
to a 23-game heater.

01:51.177 --> 01:53.313
One game away from something
real shiny, my guys.

01:53.313 --> 01:54.614
And for helping the Jims with

01:54.614 --> 01:56.516
the Reach For The Top team...

01:57.584 --> 01:59.385
...he gets to eat his stick

01:59.385 --> 02:02.655
before anybody else
gets to eat their stick.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.824
(players clapping)

02:06.526 --> 02:07.694
Fellas, um just--

02:07.694 --> 02:09.129
No, it's not a fuckin'
microphone. Hurry up

02:09.129 --> 02:11.431
and eat it,
so the boys can eat theirs.

02:11.431 --> 02:13.700
Hey! Nat's office.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.435
What if someone
had their dick out?!

02:15.435 --> 02:18.204
I'd puke at the look of it
or laugh at the size of it.

02:18.204 --> 02:20.340
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

02:20.773 --> 02:22.342
You've been summoned
by the league.

02:22.342 --> 02:23.409
- Fer what?
- Already?

02:23.409 --> 02:24.844
The Zamboni
wasn't even off yet.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.247
- Phone call or in person?
- In person, tomorrow.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.749
Under no circumstances
may you speak.

02:29.749 --> 02:32.118
We will do the talking.
- Fuck!

02:32.118 --> 02:34.053
So sick of seeing
those broads.

02:35.955 --> 02:38.625
Well, I hope Danis is wearin'
summin' good, she's sexy.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.160
- What?
- Hmm?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.195
- Did he just say...
- Danis.

02:42.195 --> 02:44.164
Sexy.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.065
- Fuck you, Shoresy!
- Fer what?

02:46.065 --> 02:47.967
We are looking at getting
our captain suspended--

02:47.967 --> 02:49.702
- They won't sussy him.
- ... for our record-breaking

02:49.702 --> 02:51.404
game and all you can say
is Danis is sexy?

02:51.404 --> 02:53.806
I think all three
of them are pretty sexy.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.210
Like, if we're gettin' it
all out on the table.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.312
Who said we're getting
it all out on the table?

02:59.312 --> 03:01.147
I've wailed on it
to the thought of the three

03:01.147 --> 03:02.916
of them taking turns on me.

03:03.783 --> 03:04.851
Really?

03:04.851 --> 03:06.586
If I'm wailing on it
and there's no internet

03:06.586 --> 03:08.154
or anything, yeah.

03:09.155 --> 03:11.758
- Talk to me about Danis.
- Well...

03:11.758 --> 03:15.395
like, I've never wanted a gal
to rough me up or anything but--

03:15.395 --> 03:17.764
- But what?
- Well, I...

03:17.764 --> 03:20.400
wouldn't mind if she did.
- Did what?

03:20.400 --> 03:22.969
- Slap you around a little bit?
- Hmm, put me in a headlock.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.604
- A headlock?
- Or a leg lock.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.172
What the fuck are you
talkin' about, dude?

03:26.172 --> 03:27.974
I dunno, just however
she'd wanna fuckin' do it.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.642
However she'd wanna fuckin'
squeeze me between her legs

03:29.642 --> 03:30.944
or whatever.
I don't fuckin' care.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.079
- We'll pick you up tomorrow.
- Oh, my God!

03:33.079 --> 03:34.981
(Nat): Wait!
- Ho-ly!

03:34.981 --> 03:36.416
- How's Frankie?
- How would you be

03:36.416 --> 03:37.917
if no one liked you?
- You tell us.

03:37.917 --> 03:40.019
- Well, someone likes him.
- The gays?

03:40.019 --> 03:41.721
(Nat): Frankie's calendars
have been so popular

03:41.721 --> 03:43.489
in the gay community
that now they want him

03:43.489 --> 03:44.991
to do an appearance.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.961
(Hitch): What's an appearance,
ol' man?

03:47.961 --> 03:50.096
When a venue pays
you to appear there.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.865
It's a fancy word for show up.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.167
But why don't they
just say that?

03:54.167 --> 03:56.603
So idiots like Frankie
feel important.

03:58.137 --> 04:00.573
- They offered $1,000.
- Pfft, settle down.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.743
He won't come out
of his room, b'y.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.645
- Well, he's gonna have to.
- Nat turned it down.

04:05.645 --> 04:07.614
She says she can make 10 times
more doing it herself.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.182
(Hitch): And what do
that mean, me son?

04:09.182 --> 04:11.718
Gay night at the Coulson.
Starring Frankie.

04:11.718 --> 04:15.555
They should call it
Going To The Dirty Areas.

04:16.489 --> 04:17.824
(Goody): Devastated.

04:18.524 --> 04:19.525
(Hitch): Inconsolable.

04:19.525 --> 04:21.327
He won't come out
of his room, b'y.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.463
They should call
it Man On Man.

04:23.463 --> 04:24.831
What's up, Pam?
What's goin' on?

04:24.831 --> 04:27.166
Fuck you, Shoresy.
Limblifter t-shirt today, Hitch.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.968
- Yeah, you're a fan, Pam?
- I was more into

04:28.968 --> 04:30.703
Age of Electric.
- Remote Control is a good tune.

04:30.703 --> 04:32.405
You should check out
their first record.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.641
- I'd love to.
- Enya is a good track.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.075
Come on, Pam,
why don't you come over

04:36.075 --> 04:38.244
and we'll play the record?
- It is a good record.

04:38.244 --> 04:40.313
Come on over,
we'll play some tunes.

04:43.349 --> 04:45.084
(footsteps approaching)

04:45.084 --> 04:46.419
(Michaels): Boys...

04:47.453 --> 04:48.688
I fucked up.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.990
- Well, you're an idiot.
- No, you know how I said

04:50.990 --> 04:52.825
that success isn't success
unless you have someone

04:52.825 --> 04:54.894
to share it with?
- My guy, did you go--

04:54.894 --> 04:56.863
Yeah, I went and saw Mercedes.
(scoffs)

04:56.863 --> 04:58.331
How's she lookin'?

04:58.331 --> 05:00.600
(rap music)

05:08.574 --> 05:10.710
She looks so fucking good.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.412
- She's a bit young but--
- Michaels.

05:12.412 --> 05:14.447
Look, I know, Sanger.
You got a squeezer off the side

05:14.447 --> 05:16.449
of Party Island
in Wasaga Beach, okay? I get it.

05:16.449 --> 05:19.052
But that was then. This is now.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.987
- You wanna talk about now?
- What?

05:20.987 --> 05:24.023
I dropped my buddy off
at her place on my way here.

05:24.023 --> 05:25.491
- Who?
- Augustine.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.260
Ah, you know he'll be
long-dickin' her.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.429
- Yeah.
- My buddy got a blowie

05:29.429 --> 05:31.464
on a boat from her
this summer in Honey Harbour.

05:31.464 --> 05:33.466
- Nice.
- What did she say?

05:34.367 --> 05:36.336
She said she wanted
to take it slow.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.538
That's not what
she said to my buddy!

05:38.538 --> 05:39.906
She said,
"You better get your dink out.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.708
Your cousin's pretty cute, too."

05:41.708 --> 05:45.244
Then she said she wants us
to go see her brother.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.182
Fer what?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.718
We need to repay
our debt to the Policetti's.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.054
Well, one of us better put on
some fuckin' Old Spice.

05:55.054 --> 05:58.024
(R&B music)

05:59.359 --> 06:01.194
Sanguinet.

06:01.994 --> 06:04.030
Why don't you come
sit beside me?

06:04.030 --> 06:05.598
Ugh.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.868
I thought you said that
we could take it slow?

06:08.868 --> 06:11.604
We can. Doesn't mean we will.
You smell good.

06:11.604 --> 06:13.606
So um...

06:13.606 --> 06:15.675
it's time for us
to pay our debt or--

06:15.675 --> 06:17.143
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

06:17.143 --> 06:19.412
Sanguinet, last year,
the Bulldogs came

06:19.412 --> 06:21.581
to the Policetti's
in need of a favour.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.182
That favour was granted.

06:23.182 --> 06:25.084
Now the Policetti's
need a favour from you.

06:25.084 --> 06:26.552
- A favour?
- That's just the word

06:26.552 --> 06:27.620
I'm using. You're gonna do it.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.188
What is it that
you'd like us--

06:29.188 --> 06:30.790
Shh, shh, shh.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.725
You remember Angelo?

06:32.725 --> 06:33.793
Where's Luca?

06:33.793 --> 06:35.495
This is specifically
for Angelo.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.196
Okay, well, then does
that mean that we're--

06:37.196 --> 06:38.498
Wh-whuh!

06:38.498 --> 06:40.233
Angelo heard that Frankie's
doing an appearance

06:40.233 --> 06:42.268
at The Man Advantage.
- The Man Advantage?

06:42.268 --> 06:43.636
Yeah, Nat's gay night
at the Coulson.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.037
That's what they're
calling it?

06:45.037 --> 06:47.774
Yeah, I would've gone
with Hard On Pucks, but alas,

06:47.774 --> 06:50.610
The Man Advantage. Angelo wants
to go with you guys.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.345
Oh, I don't think
we're all planning on going.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.813
- No, you're goin'.
- I don't think

06:53.813 --> 06:55.815
Frankie will even go.
- Oh, Frankie's for sure going.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.485
Why does he want to go
to the gay night at the Coulson?

06:59.485 --> 07:01.387
Why do you think?

07:01.387 --> 07:02.588
I dunno.

07:02.588 --> 07:06.058
Sanguinet, why do you think?

07:09.929 --> 07:12.064
Ah, there it is. Thank you.

07:12.064 --> 07:13.633
The limo will be outside
at 8:00 p.m.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.735
to pick you guys up.
- Oh, may I speak?

07:15.735 --> 07:16.736
(sighs)
- Yeah.

07:16.736 --> 07:19.238
Maybe uh, we could...

07:19.238 --> 07:21.541
grab a glass of wine
tonight together?

07:22.141 --> 07:24.110
Sanguinet's bringing
Augustine over.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.980
You can come up
with him, though.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.049
I have a date with Miig.

07:30.049 --> 07:32.351
Ooh, bring her too.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.589
(Hitch): Frankie!
(Big Sexy): Tit fucker!

07:36.589 --> 07:38.391
(knocking on door)
(Hitch): Jean-Jacques

07:38.391 --> 07:39.692
Francois Jacques-Jean!

07:39.692 --> 07:41.727
(knocking on door)
(Big Sexy): Tit fucker!

07:41.727 --> 07:43.696
B'y he's in a bad way ol' man.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.399
- We'll get him out.
- Hey, you like toast, eh?

07:46.399 --> 07:48.267
The arse is fallin'
right out of 'er, it is.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.536
- Ever have pickles on toast?
- B'ys are lucky he's here

07:50.536 --> 07:53.005
at all. Last year,
he chased Laurence Leboeuf

07:53.005 --> 07:55.174
right back to Quebec.
- Laurence Leboeuf?

07:55.174 --> 07:56.876
(Melodie): Laurence Leboeuf?

07:58.110 --> 07:59.479
She's here?

08:00.012 --> 08:02.081
You're supposed to be
weaning yourself off it.

08:02.081 --> 08:03.549
- Off what?
- Ass.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.518
'Cause we're one win away
from a league record.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.119
- Settle down.
- You gotta fight it a bit,

08:07.119 --> 08:09.021
boys. Let's get fightin' it
a bit in here now.

08:09.021 --> 08:10.723
What are you guys
talking about?

08:10.723 --> 08:12.058
Nothin'.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.926
- No?
- No, nothin'.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.528
Okay.

08:18.731 --> 08:20.132
Fuck, does she look good.

08:20.132 --> 08:22.134
- Looks unbelievable.
- Ho-ly!

08:22.134 --> 08:24.871
B'y it's rare to see a girl
look so good as what she did.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.038
Yew!

08:27.106 --> 08:28.574
Yew-hew-hew!

08:29.308 --> 08:31.143
Let's start exercising
a bit of discipline in here.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.212
Let's exercise a bit
of discipline in here now.

08:37.149 --> 08:38.451
No, nothing.

08:38.451 --> 08:39.719
Okay...

08:44.123 --> 08:45.791
- Fuckin' hell.
- Fuckin' heaven.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.227
- And now she's in that.
- Little dab'll do ya.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.396
Boy, they sure know how to
put their best foots forward.

08:50.396 --> 08:51.664
- Feet.
- Feets?

08:51.664 --> 08:53.332
- Just feet.
- Boy, they sure know how

08:53.332 --> 08:54.834
to put their best feet forward.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.570
But b'ys, we gotta get
him outta der.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.038
Well then, maybe bake a cake.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.740
Try to lure him out
with the smell.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.676
If that doesn't work,
do up some taco meat.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.077
You ever had an Indian taco?

09:05.077 --> 09:07.146
Even just beep
the microwave a few times.

09:07.146 --> 09:09.682
That might even do it.
- Where're you goin', b'y?

09:11.050 --> 09:12.618
(Nat): Ready to get your pee-pee
whacked by the league?

09:12.618 --> 09:15.154
Those women can do more
than that to my pee-pee.

09:15.154 --> 09:18.424
Remember, under no
circumstances do you speak.

09:18.424 --> 09:19.659
We'll do the talking.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.294
You better hope they
don't sussy you, slut.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.795
Who's fucking you?

09:22.795 --> 09:24.230
You mean who am I fucking?

09:24.230 --> 09:25.498
Who's she fuckin'?

09:25.498 --> 09:26.933
This is how
he says I look good.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.501
- You all look good.
- Hey, thanks, man.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.836
- Except Ziig.
- Oh, fuck you, Shoresy.

09:30.836 --> 09:32.738
Did you get us a limo?

09:36.075 --> 09:37.510
- Two secs.
- Two secs?

09:37.510 --> 09:40.079
Yeah, Ziig, you gonna ride
with your head out the window?

09:48.921 --> 09:50.623
Schwartzy?
(Shoresy): Shoresy.

09:50.623 --> 09:51.958
Get in.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.463
My brother and I will be here
at 8:00

09:57.463 --> 09:59.198
to pick up Frankie
for The Man Advantage.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.566
- Is it The Man Advantage?
- Yeah.

10:00.566 --> 10:02.068
- Huh?
- I would've gone with Tip In,

10:02.068 --> 10:04.036
but alas, The Man Advantage.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.539
Frankie's feelin'
a little blue.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.507
I don't think he's gonna make it
to The Man Advantage.

10:08.507 --> 10:10.309
(mockingly): Oh, no!

10:10.309 --> 10:12.612
- Yeah, so...
- Shorty?

10:12.612 --> 10:13.746
Shoresy.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.681
That's what happens
if Frankie's not sittin'

10:15.681 --> 10:17.650
exactly where you are tonight.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.318
Get the fuck outta here.

10:21.153 --> 10:23.089
(footsteps thud away)

10:25.524 --> 10:27.493
(Aki): Would you look at that?

10:30.997 --> 10:32.465
This is upsetting.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.435
I thought he'd be taller.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.504
You're actually
presentable for once.

10:38.504 --> 10:39.905
Who?
(Danis): Not you.

10:39.905 --> 10:41.874
(Aki): Miigwan.
- Hi, Aki.

10:41.874 --> 10:43.542
You're about the cutest
thing I ever did see.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.177
She is the cutest thing
I ever did see.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.747
- What do you think, Nina?
- Wowipops and wainbows.

10:47.747 --> 10:49.448
(Aki): Ziigwan.
- Aki.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.283
You smell like a urinal puck.

10:51.283 --> 10:52.952
(Danis): Shoresy...

10:52.952 --> 10:54.720
smile a little for me, hun.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.422
(Aki): I thought he'd be
younger, too.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.724
What do you think, Nina?
- He's a six.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.293
We enjoyed the calendars.
They selling?

11:01.293 --> 11:02.828
- Five figures.
- That will help your bid

11:02.828 --> 11:04.163
for the National
Senior Tournament.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.265
We are very close to our goal.

11:06.265 --> 11:07.466
Shoresy...

11:09.468 --> 11:11.871
...you crosschecked
MacPherson in the face, slut.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.707
- He was hot dogging.
- And by hot dogging you mean?

11:14.707 --> 11:16.709
- Showboating. Big timing.
- Dipsy-doodling.

11:16.709 --> 11:20.112
The game is changing, Nat.
There are new elements to it.

11:20.112 --> 11:21.981
- And?
- And those are three of them.

11:21.981 --> 11:23.683
That was a lot of blood.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.752
- Did he lose any teeth?
- It was from his nose.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.721
- Broken?
- No, his visor cut him.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.222
So, no broken bones,

11:30.222 --> 11:32.191
he still has all his teeth.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.727
What's the problem?
- That was a lot of blood.

11:34.727 --> 11:37.897
Why can't you play more like
the French guy, what's his name?

11:38.364 --> 11:40.766
(Hitch): Frankie!
(knocking on door)

11:40.766 --> 11:42.168
Sweetest Jeezus!

11:42.168 --> 11:44.336
- You like birds, eh?
- I could fuck with a bird.

11:44.336 --> 11:46.072
No b'ys,
this is no good anyway.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.373
- Settle down.
- He's parked 'er

11:47.373 --> 11:48.607
broadside in there.
- What?

11:48.607 --> 11:50.676
He ain't comin'
out for no one.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.680
- He needs to get one of these.
- I wants to, Britt.

11:56.716 --> 12:00.219
- What happened to Bethany Dawn?
- Didn't remember his name.

12:03.155 --> 12:05.624
Huh, I'm lookin' for
summin' a little deeper.

12:07.126 --> 12:10.396
I just wants a girl
to come by, play some tunes.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.964
(Ziig): That's pussy shit.

12:11.964 --> 12:13.332
If you wanna showboat
and hot dog,

12:13.332 --> 12:15.167
you answer the bell.
- Don't get twatty with us.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.636
We'll get twatty right back.
What do you think, Nina?

12:17.636 --> 12:19.872
Harry Twatter
and the Chamber of Secrets.

12:19.872 --> 12:21.273
(Aki): Youse get big crowds.

12:21.273 --> 12:22.708
(Danis): And a lot
of kids now, I see.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.643
They don't wanna see that
and neither do we.

12:24.643 --> 12:27.313
Shoresy, your YouTube chirps
have brought attention

12:27.313 --> 12:29.548
to the league. Good and bad.

12:29.548 --> 12:31.417
All publicity
is good publicity.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.785
We agree.

12:32.785 --> 12:35.121
So, we're gonna go easy on you.

12:35.121 --> 12:36.522
You're suspended
for the remainder

12:36.522 --> 12:38.290
of the regular season.
- Fer what?!

12:38.290 --> 12:39.959
- Shoresy.
- So, just one game?

12:39.959 --> 12:41.994
I hope it's not a big
one or anything, is it?

12:41.994 --> 12:43.829
- You'll be back for playoffs.
- Ladies...

12:43.829 --> 12:46.265
Shoresy, the game
has changed.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.100
This didn't happen by accident.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.302
There has been a concerted
effort from the ground up

12:50.302 --> 12:52.671
for years to make hockey
less dangerous.

12:52.671 --> 12:54.673
It's about speed now, finesse.

12:54.673 --> 12:56.242
That's what the fans want.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.611
You need to understand this
and adjust to it.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.447
Because what you're doing
is not good for the game.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.817
(gavel clunks)
Good luck in playoffs.

13:08.587 --> 13:09.622
Nat?

13:13.058 --> 13:16.195
Good time to remind you these
sessions are recorded?

13:17.630 --> 13:20.132
You don't decide
what's good for the game.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.735
Pardon?

13:22.735 --> 13:24.270
We just suspended
your captain.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.872
Quite literally, we decide
what's good for the game.

13:26.872 --> 13:29.141
You can take the dog
outta the fight,

13:29.141 --> 13:31.243
but you can't take the fight
outta the dog.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.046
You don't decide
what's good for the game.

13:34.046 --> 13:36.749
The fans don't decide
what's good for the game.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.751
The players who are out there
on the ice,

13:38.751 --> 13:41.420
sweating and bleeding,
decide what's good for the game.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.156
- What do you think, Nina?
- Audacious.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.525
Hockey players have always
governed themselves.

13:46.525 --> 13:48.561
That's what sets
this game apart.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.530
It's a game played
with honour and respect.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.165
Because if you wanna
play dishonourably

13:53.165 --> 13:56.869
or disrespectfully, you'll get
your fuckin' teeth knocked out.

13:56.869 --> 13:59.271
This is senior
whale shit hockey.

13:59.271 --> 14:00.940
No one comes
for the speed and finesse.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.641
They come to see us
kill each other.

14:02.641 --> 14:03.909
Shoresy.

14:04.877 --> 14:06.579
So, you can try
and change the game

14:06.579 --> 14:08.514
with your concentrated effort
from the ground up.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.316
- Concerted.
- But they're among the last

14:10.316 --> 14:14.253
to play this game the way
it was meant to be played.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.322
And you can't change them.

14:20.059 --> 14:22.061
- Nat...
- What?

14:22.061 --> 14:24.797
You have the best
attendance in the league.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.031
Yeah.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.766
The other four teams
have their best attendance

14:27.766 --> 14:30.135
when we're in town, too.
- Defending champs.

14:30.135 --> 14:31.937
23-game heater.

14:35.641 --> 14:39.511
And he's extremely attracted
to all three of you.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.614
Is that true?

14:42.815 --> 14:44.717
I'd love to meet
your husbands.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.652
- Why?
- Shake their hand.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.120
- Oh yeah?
- Oh, I'd love

14:48.120 --> 14:49.555
to buy 'em a beer.

14:52.157 --> 14:54.727
I have to say, Natalie,
I agree with you.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.796
I'm here for it, too.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.465
This is the one league
where players

14:59.465 --> 15:04.036
still play the game,
well, like my dad did.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.139
- And my dad.
- Nina?

15:07.139 --> 15:09.141
Dad, Granddad,
and six big brothers.

15:09.141 --> 15:11.644
If the fans wanna watch
a game for speed and finesse

15:11.644 --> 15:15.014
with no physicality, they can
watch the World Juniors.

15:15.014 --> 15:16.315
What's happened
to that tournament?

15:16.315 --> 15:17.917
It's fucking basketball.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.586
- They're breeding divers.
- This is the NOSHO.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.154
Take the teeth outta the game,

15:22.154 --> 15:24.723
take away our right
to govern ourselves,

15:24.723 --> 15:26.759
you'll have no show, all right.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.598
We've changed our ruling.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.100
(gavel clunks)
Good luck in Soo Michigan.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.468
(exhaling happily)
(Danis): You could make

15:36.468 --> 15:37.937
history here, Natalie.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.006
Somethin' real shiny.
What do you think, Nina?

15:41.006 --> 15:43.208
You don't wanna
lose to the Yanks.

15:43.208 --> 15:44.777
(Shoresy cries)
(Aki): Oh, and what's this

15:44.777 --> 15:47.646
I hear about you guys having
gay night down at the Coulson?

15:47.646 --> 15:49.581
What's it called,
Back Door Tuck In?

15:49.581 --> 15:51.450
- The Man Advantage.
- I would've gone

15:51.450 --> 15:53.519
with D-Men, but alas.

15:54.987 --> 15:57.089
They let dykes go too, Ziig?

15:57.823 --> 15:59.792
(knock echoes on glass)

16:01.794 --> 16:03.162
- Suspended?
- No.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.831
- Well, no broken bones.
- He's still got all his teeth.

16:05.831 --> 16:07.366
Then what's the problem?

16:07.366 --> 16:09.935
I've come to tell you
your window's closing.

16:09.935 --> 16:11.203
Finally seduce Danis?

16:11.203 --> 16:12.938
I wouldn't even know
what to do with her.

16:12.938 --> 16:14.506
- That is a woman.
- I'd make a fuckin'

16:14.506 --> 16:16.909
fool of myself.
- So, who's stealing you?

16:16.909 --> 16:19.678
I'll be attending gay night
at the Coulson tonight.

16:19.678 --> 16:22.348
- You're goin'?
- I'm told, if I'd like to,

16:22.348 --> 16:24.683
I could fuck some
dudes up the ass.

16:24.683 --> 16:26.785
- You ever done that before?
- No.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.520
I think your window's closing.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.789
Listen, I'm told there's
a pretty good time to be had

16:30.789 --> 16:32.725
at these things,
if I'm up for it.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.661
But maybe if you come down,
I'll keep my wits about me.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.830
- Maybe?
- Well, already started drinkin'

16:37.830 --> 16:40.165
so, it's a soft maybe.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.202
Maybe.

16:44.370 --> 16:47.339
(electric pop music)

17:07.893 --> 17:10.062
(♪)

17:24.943 --> 17:26.412
Yeah so...

17:26.979 --> 17:27.913
Where the fuck is Frankie?

17:27.913 --> 17:29.148
Don't know where he's to.

17:29.148 --> 17:30.983
My guess is back in Quebec.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.284
I mean, he's not
in his room anymore.

17:32.284 --> 17:33.886
Awesome.
(Laurence): Hey!

17:35.587 --> 17:38.357
- Ooh.
- Where were you at, me son?

17:41.293 --> 17:43.896
- Laurence Leboeuf?
- Laurence Leboeuf.

17:45.531 --> 17:46.765
Bingo.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.333
- Too Many Men?
- Let's talk about

17:48.333 --> 17:50.903
an after party later, too.
- Mm-hmm.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.205
Get in.

17:56.975 --> 18:00.946
So, you came all the way
back for JJ Fun Dip JJ.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.648
If he could understand
what you were saying,

18:02.648 --> 18:05.117
he would kick your ass.
- But he can't.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.553
There's a good man
in there, you know?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.856
He just needed to be humbled.

18:11.390 --> 18:13.559
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

18:14.293 --> 18:15.928
Les Québécois
stand by their own.

18:19.231 --> 18:22.000
(electric pop music intensifies)

18:35.180 --> 18:37.416
(♪)

19:06.945 --> 19:08.847
(♪)

19:23.028 --> 19:24.363
(music decrescendos)

19:24.363 --> 19:27.699
Lard Jeezus b'y, who knit ya?

19:27.699 --> 19:29.134
Ted Hitchcock.

19:29.134 --> 19:32.604
Ah, she knows me name.

19:32.604 --> 19:34.072
(laughs)
- What?

19:34.806 --> 19:36.041
Pam...

19:37.609 --> 19:39.545
...would you like to dance?

19:41.446 --> 19:43.882
I don't really
like this music.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.185
Okay.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.220
But we could go home.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.423
Play some tunes.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.526
(music crescendos)

19:54.526 --> 19:56.762
(♪)

20:10.442 --> 20:12.244
(music stops)

20:12.244 --> 20:15.080
You're surprisingly lucid
for this point in the evening.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.015
And you wanna mess it all up?

20:19.117 --> 20:21.820
- Why do you still do it?
- Here's a cab.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.855
I don't want it right now,
I'm talking to you.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.958
Let's get some fuckin'
Indian cuisine.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.060
- So, why do you still do it?
- Do what?

20:28.060 --> 20:29.127
(both): Huh?

20:29.127 --> 20:31.296
You got a decade
on most of these guys.

20:31.296 --> 20:32.664
Well, I'm no spring chicken.

20:32.664 --> 20:34.933
But you're the first
to the rink, the last to leave,

20:34.933 --> 20:36.335
you're the hardest
worker out there.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.303
- You gotta set the tone.
- You work even harder

20:38.303 --> 20:40.372
off the ice.
The calendar, all the promos.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.574
- Jory fuckin' Jordan.
- And now you're sittin'

20:42.574 --> 20:44.776
outside a gay bar essentially,
the last one to leave

20:44.776 --> 20:47.012
your team fundraiser.
- I think Hitch

20:47.012 --> 20:48.880
looked a lot gayer than Frankie.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.483
All this for senior
whale shit hockey?

20:52.584 --> 20:55.621
Used to be senior
whale shit hockey.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.389
Now it's sumin' different.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.725
So, why do you do it?

20:59.725 --> 21:01.627
It's the only place
I can be me.

21:01.627 --> 21:02.794
What do you mean by that?

21:02.794 --> 21:05.030
I mean, it's the last place
in the world

21:05.030 --> 21:06.365
I can be me.

21:06.365 --> 21:09.234
You basically just
repeated yourself.

21:09.234 --> 21:11.436
I'll tell ya a story.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.038
So, I'm at the bar one night,

21:13.038 --> 21:16.408
a guy pushes up on my girl,
so I lose my mind.

21:16.408 --> 21:18.810
- You tried to fight him?
- Well, I tried to sucker him,

21:18.810 --> 21:21.113
hurt him before
he could hurt me, but...

21:21.113 --> 21:23.915
either way, as a hockey player,

21:23.915 --> 21:25.617
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.253
By punching someone
when they weren't looking?

21:28.253 --> 21:31.790
In hockey,
if someone disrespects you,

21:31.790 --> 21:34.726
or your teammates,
you can flatten 'em.

21:34.726 --> 21:37.296
One way or another,
you get 'em.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.598
And when ya do,
everybody loves it.

21:39.598 --> 21:43.135
The coaches, teammates,
the fans are all cheerin'.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.437
Everybody's all for it.

21:45.437 --> 21:48.040
At the bar that night...
(kisses teeth)

21:48.040 --> 21:50.309
...no one was cheering.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.344
The guy thought
I was an idiot,

21:52.344 --> 21:55.414
and the girl thought
I was a loser.

21:55.414 --> 21:57.849
That's the real world.

21:57.849 --> 21:59.418
So...

21:59.418 --> 22:00.786
even though I'm at the age

22:00.786 --> 22:01.753
where half my hair

22:01.753 --> 22:04.823
is on the fuckin' shower floor,

22:04.823 --> 22:06.992
gonna keep goin' to the rink.

22:07.759 --> 22:09.761
That's where I can be me.

22:09.761 --> 22:10.862
Yeah?

22:10.862 --> 22:12.497
Hell yeah, fuck yeah.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.133
(cab engine rumbling)

22:22.908 --> 22:24.076
Wanna share a cab?

22:24.076 --> 22:25.711
I can walk from here.

22:26.378 --> 22:27.879
To my place.

22:27.879 --> 22:30.682
(rock music)

22:39.157 --> 22:40.926
(music intensifies)
