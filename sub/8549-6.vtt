00:08.042 --> 00:10.411
OH, HARRIETTE.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.047
HARRIETTE!

00:16.984 --> 00:19.387
I CAN'T FIND MY SHOES.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.556
THOSE THINGS ON YOUR FEET
LOOK SHOELIKE.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.893
NOT THESE.
MY RED FLATS.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.395
LAURA, HAVE YOU
SEEN THEM?

00:27.461 --> 00:28.762
NOPE. SORRY.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.231

HAS THEM.

00:30.298 --> 00:33.234
SHE'S BEEN BORROWING MY STUFF
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

00:33.301 --> 00:37.037
WE'RE LATE.
CAN WE PLEASE GO?

00:37.105 --> 00:40.040
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON
FOR 20 YEARS.

00:40.108 --> 00:43.177
WHO DOES SHE THINK WE ARE,
THE DOUBLEMINT TWINS?

00:46.547 --> 00:47.715
LAURA...

00:47.781 --> 00:51.051
HAVE YOU SEEN MY RED JACKET

00:51.119 --> 00:53.287
NOPE. SORRY.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.689
I'LL BET HARRIETTE

MY STUFF SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.427
MAKE ME SICK.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.162
MY STUFF'S MY STUFF.
IT'S NOT HER STUFF.

01:01.229 --> 01:05.199
THAT'S WHY THEY
CALL IT MY STUFF.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.310
I THOUGHT THEY'D
NEVER LEAVE.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.679
WELL, I'M
OUT OF HERE.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.485
HEY! THAT'S MY PURSE.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.420
WHOOPS! LATER...

01:37.165 --> 01:39.300

01:39.367 --> 01:40.734

03:00.914 --> 03:03.917
RICHIE, WHY ARE YOU

03:03.984 --> 03:06.119
* THEY SAY I'M CRAZY *

03:06.186 --> 03:07.888
* I CAN DO
WHAT I WANNA DO *

03:07.955 --> 03:09.823
* IT'S MY PREROGATIVE *

03:14.428 --> 03:17.998
SORRY. WE'VE BEEN
LISTENING TO BOBBY BROWN.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.733
WHAT'S PREROGATIVE MEAN?

03:19.800 --> 03:23.203
IT MEANS...DON'T
PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD.

03:27.341 --> 03:30.544
LAURA, HOW WAS
CAREER DAY?

03:30.611 --> 03:32.613
MY GRADES
ARE GOOD ENOUGH

03:32.680 --> 03:34.915
TO GET INTO
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL.

03:34.982 --> 03:35.649
HARVARD!

03:35.716 --> 03:37.050
THAT'S MY GIRL.

03:37.117 --> 03:40.087
AH, JUST HOW MUCH IS IT TO GO TO
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL THESE DAYS?

03:40.153 --> 03:42.390
SIXTEEN THOUSAND
DOLLARS A YEAR.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.525
OOH! OOH! MM-HMM.

03:44.592 --> 03:48.796
SOMEBODY GET THE SMELLIN' SALT.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.098
OF COURSE YOU'D SAVE A LOT
IF I GOT A SCHOLARSHIP.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.967
WHY ARE YOU WASTING
YOUR TIME EATIN'? GO STUDY.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.439
EDWARD,
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

03:58.506 --> 04:00.708
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
FOR THE FUTURE?

04:00.774 --> 04:02.242
ROCK STAR.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.148
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S YOUR PLAN?

04:08.215 --> 04:09.683
SON, IT MIGHT BE WISE

04:09.750 --> 04:12.920
TO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
TO FALL BACK ON.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.154
NO PROBLEM, DAD.

04:14.221 --> 04:16.624
I CAN BE A MODEL.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.994
ARE YOU GOING TO BE
THE BEFORE OR THE AFTER?

04:28.736 --> 04:31.705
HEY, DAD.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.607
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO THE MOVIES.

04:33.674 --> 04:34.508
I WAS,

04:34.575 --> 04:37.311
BUT JOLENE
RAN OUT OF MONEY.

04:39.713 --> 04:40.781
WOMEN.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.450
YEAH.

04:42.516 --> 04:45.819
EDWARD, I THINK IT'S TIME
TO HAVE OUR LITTLE TALK.

04:45.886 --> 04:49.256
OH, NO! DAD...IS THIS
PHASE TWO OF

04:49.323 --> 04:50.824
"WHAT I'LL DO
IN THE FUTURE"?

04:50.891 --> 04:52.159
YES, EDWARD.

04:52.225 --> 04:54.595
I SHOULD'VE SPRUNG
FOR THE MOVIE.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.401
SON...

05:00.468 --> 05:03.804
SOMETIMES IN LIFE,
WE AGONIZE OVER DECISIONS

05:03.871 --> 05:04.805
AND THEN LATER ON

05:04.872 --> 05:07.575
REALIZE THEY WEREN'T
ALL THAT IMPORTANT.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.043
BUT, EDWARD,
CHOOSING A CAREER

05:10.110 --> 05:11.579
IS IMPORTANT.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.881
NOW, ASIDE
FROM A ROCK STAR--

05:13.947 --> 05:15.483
OR MODEL.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.950
OR MODEL...

05:18.719 --> 05:21.088
WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU
LIKE TO BE?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.656
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.992
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
ABOUT IT A LOT.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.395
I THOUGHT AND THOUGHT

05:27.461 --> 05:30.163
AND THOUGHT
UNTIL MY HEAD HURT.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.766
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.203
ARE YOU OPEN TO
CAREER SUGGESTIONS?

05:36.269 --> 05:38.872
SURE. WHAT DO YOU GOT?

05:38.939 --> 05:41.809
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT BEING A POLICEMAN?

05:48.215 --> 05:50.818
I MEAN, NOT REALLY.

05:52.586 --> 05:56.557
EDWARD, POLICE WORK
IS SUBSTANTIAL AND SATISFYING.

05:56.624 --> 05:58.659
IT'S A JOB
YOU CAN BE PROUD OF.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.694
IT'S ALSO
A FAMILY TRADITION.

06:00.761 --> 06:04.832
ME. MY FATHER.
AND MAYBE NOW YOU.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.233
SON, THINK ABOUT IT.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.901
DON'T MAKE
YOUR HEAD HURT,

06:07.968 --> 06:10.003
BUT THINK ABOUT IT.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.705
ALRIGHT.

06:11.772 --> 06:12.773
HEY.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.909
MY BOSS STARTED
A POLICE RIDE-ALONG PROGRAM.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.210
YOU CAN CHECK OUT

06:17.277 --> 06:19.046
THE DAY IN THE LIFE
OF A COP.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.014
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

06:21.081 --> 06:22.450
I SAID
I'D THINK ABOUT IT.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.251
I'LL SAVE YOU TIME.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.553
YOU'RE GOING.

06:37.865 --> 06:41.535
WELL, MURTAGH,
THIS IS IT, THE OLD HOMESTEAD.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.840
SERGEANT, THIS IS
A FINE HOUSE.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.644
COP'S HOUSE.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.482
THANK YOU, SIR.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.417
I'M HONORED THAT
YOU WANT TO MEET MY SON.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.553
IN THIS
CRIME-PLAGUED SOCIETY,

06:59.620 --> 07:01.789
WE NEED EVERY GOOD MAN
WE CAN GET.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.725
IF YOUR SON WANTS TO
JOIN THE BATTLE,

07:04.792 --> 07:06.560
I WANT TO
SHAKE HIS HAND.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.463
I'M SURE
HE'LL BE THRILLED.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.965
YOU KNOW,
MY SON'S A COP.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.667
MY DAUGHTER, TOO.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.505
MY DOG'S IN
THE CANINE CORPS.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.510
WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE?

07:22.576 --> 07:24.111
SHE LEFT ME.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.016
WOMEN.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.085
YEAH.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.326
HONEST, EDDO.
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.529
IT'S A SCIENTIFIC
FACT.

07:41.595 --> 07:45.032
RATS JUST
CAN'T VOMIT.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.868
STEVE! WHO CARES?

07:47.935 --> 07:51.471
A GUY SITTING IN FRONT OF A RAT
ON A ROLLER-COASTER.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.342
EDWARD, ALL SET
FOR THE RIDE-ALONG?

07:55.408 --> 07:58.679
I'M SORRY, DAD.
I CAN'T GO.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.814
WH--

08:00.881 --> 08:02.215
EXCUSE ME.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.724
HI.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.095
EVER FRISK A WOMAN?

08:17.430 --> 08:19.366
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU CAN'T GO?

08:19.432 --> 08:22.435
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THE MODELING AGENCY.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.436
THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR NEW CLIENTS.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.206
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.008
MODELING?

08:28.075 --> 08:29.242
YEAH.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.744
ISN'T IT GREAT?

08:30.811 --> 08:34.715
EDWARD, YOU HAVE REALLY
LET ME DOWN THIS TIME.

08:36.550 --> 08:40.621
I AM VERY, VERY
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.895
THIS DOG HAS
QUITE A SMILE.

08:47.961 --> 08:51.498
YEAH, GOOD OLD
BLOOD FANG.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.701
HE'D LAY DOWN
HIS LIFE FOR ME.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.169
HOW'D YOU TRAIN HIM
TO HOLD THAT GUN?

08:58.405 --> 09:00.507
SO, WINSLOW,

09:00.574 --> 09:02.976
IS YOUR SON GOING
ON THE RIDE-ALONG?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.044
UH...

09:04.111 --> 09:04.712
NO, SIR.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.013
I'M AFRAID HE FORGOT

09:06.079 --> 09:10.083
THAT TODAY WAS HIS
PARAMEDIC RIDE-ALONG.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.585
GOOD GROUP.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.554
WE PLUG 'EM,
THEY PATCH 'EM.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.724
SO, YOU JUST WASTED

09:16.790 --> 09:19.192
43 MINUTES OF MY--
LET'S BE HONEST--

09:19.259 --> 09:20.527
PRECIOUS TIME?

09:20.594 --> 09:21.862
UH...

09:21.929 --> 09:24.364
WELL, I'M SORRY,
SIR, BUT, UH...

09:24.431 --> 09:27.200
CAN I GO?
CAN I GO?

09:27.267 --> 09:28.435
EXCELLENT IDEA.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.937
TAKE YOUR OTHER SON.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.976
THAT IS AN
EXCELLENT IDEA, SIR.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.778
EXCUSE ME.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.387
NICE MEETING YOU, KID.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.823
PUT HER THERE.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.491
SIX MONTHS
IN THE ACADEMY

09:51.558 --> 09:54.061
WILL FIRM UP
THAT GRIP.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.163
EXCUSE ME.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.975
GOOD DAY, GENTLEMEN.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.989
I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A POLICE CAR.

10:22.055 --> 10:25.025
I WAS IN
AN AMBULANCE ONCE.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.093
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:26.159 --> 10:28.962
UNAVOIDABLE ACCIDENT.
ON MY 5th BIRTHDAY,

10:29.029 --> 10:32.165
MY PARENTS USED ME
TO BREAK THE PInATA.

10:36.704 --> 10:39.239
HEY, WHAT'S
THIS BUTTON FOR?

10:39.306 --> 10:41.308
[SIRENS BLARE]

10:44.678 --> 10:46.146
AW!

10:46.213 --> 10:49.683
WE DON'T NEED THE SIREN

10:49.750 --> 10:51.584
OKEY-DOKE.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.888
HEY, WHAT'S IN
THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT?

10:56.489 --> 10:57.958
NOTHING! OH!

WHOA!

10:59.492 --> 11:00.593
WHEW.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.163
I'VE NEVER SEEN A NUN
MOVE THAT FAST.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.134
JUST DON'T TOUCH
ANYTHING ELSE, OKAY?

11:08.168 --> 11:11.171
HEY, CAN I HOLD
YOUR SHOTGUN?

11:11.238 --> 11:12.940
DO I LOOK STUPID?

11:13.006 --> 11:15.442

11:37.497 --> 11:39.366
STEP ON IT, PARD.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.701
LET'S NAIL

12:57.010 --> 12:58.378
YOU WERE GONE
A LONG TIME,

12:58.445 --> 13:01.381
AND THE HUMAN BLADDER
ONLY HOLDS 14 OUNCES.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.583
NEVER MIND.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.352
GET IN THE CAR.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.655
DID YOU NOTICE
THAT LANTERN?

13:08.721 --> 13:11.058
WHY DO YOU THINK
I CAME IN HERE?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.064
