The whole town,
dark.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.331
'Street lights, everything.'

03:53.333 --> 03:56.567
Oh! Curses and criminy.
What confounded luck!

03:56.569 --> 03:59.604
Gotham City is having
a power failure

03:59.606 --> 04:01.005
just like New York.

04:02.475 --> 04:02.974
The cops.

04:02.976 --> 04:06.344
I don't like the twist
this joke is taking.

04:06.346 --> 04:09.614
Get us away!
Cheese it, everyone!

04:09.616 --> 04:12.283
Let's go, let's go.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.067
Strange, an abandoned truck.

04:29.069 --> 04:32.070
Let's have a look inside.

04:37.377 --> 04:38.142
'Holy smoke!'

04:38.144 --> 04:41.245
Quick, cut us out of here
before the power comes on.

04:41.247 --> 04:45.650
Of that's what we will be,
just holy smokes!

04:48.088 --> 04:51.022
A mobile slot machine
torture van.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.224
The mere possession
of such a vehicle

04:53.226 --> 04:54.425
violates 17 separate statutes.

04:54.427 --> 04:58.363
And not a shred of evidence
tying it to the devilish Joker.

04:58.365 --> 05:01.432
No fingerprints,
stolen license plates..

05:01.434 --> 05:05.003
You overlooked this,
Chief O'Hara.

05:05.005 --> 05:05.570
A reel of tape?

05:05.572 --> 05:08.539
Right. The tape from our
anti-crime recorder.

05:08.541 --> 05:11.275
Before setting out tonight,
I equipped my utility belt

05:11.277 --> 05:12.710
with a tiny microphone
and transmitter.

05:12.712 --> 05:16.748
'Every word those criminals said
was recorded in the Batmobile.'

05:16.750 --> 05:18.716
But what good will that do,
Boy wonder?

05:18.718 --> 05:21.219
I thought you said
they spoke to you

05:21.221 --> 05:23.154
through a trick voice distorter.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.391
Tricky, commissioner.
Tricky, but vain.

05:26.393 --> 05:28.693
They didn't realize
that every human voice

05:28.695 --> 05:31.629
has its own
private wave pattern.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.331
Private as a fingerprint.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.132
Astounding.

05:34.134 --> 05:37.368
Is it evidence? Can it be used
by the district attorney?

05:37.370 --> 05:39.337
True, the courts won't
accept it as yet.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.572
I think I'll take
this tape to the Bat-cave.

05:41.574 --> 05:44.575
Run it through the anti-crime
voice analyzer.

05:44.577 --> 05:46.644
Check it against
the voice file.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.646
That way, we'll learn
the identity

05:48.648 --> 05:49.647
of the Joker's henchmen.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.282
We might be able to follow

05:51.284 --> 05:54.218
one of them to
the Joker's hideout.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.186
Robin's right.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.655
It's our only card.
Let's hope it's a trump.

05:57.657 --> 06:01.159
I'm afraid the Joker may still
hold the winning hand, Batman.

06:01.161 --> 06:04.762
Will the anti-crime voice
analyzer operate without power?

06:04.764 --> 06:07.398
Fortunately, commissioner,
the Bat-cave is equipped

06:07.400 --> 06:09.400
with an anti-crime
auxiliary generator.

06:09.402 --> 06:13.171
Which automatically
compensates power failure.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.238
Saints be praised.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.276
And the Caped Crusader's
advanced technology.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.411
To the Bat-cave.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.816
<i> Morning!</i>
<i> Hallelujah.</i>

06:25.818 --> 06:29.053
<i> The mighty power grid</i>
<i> serving Gotham City</i>

06:29.055 --> 06:29.954
<i> is back in action.</i>

06:29.956 --> 06:36.160
<i> And in the Batcave, deep below</i>
<i> stately Wayne Manor..</i>

06:38.398 --> 06:40.264
Master scope
circuit, A-Okay.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.333
Let's check the beginning
of the tape.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.401
Right.

06:43.903 --> 06:47.071
That'll be Susie when we
ran into her in the hall.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.407
'Am I ever glad
to see you two.'

06:49.409 --> 06:50.408
- Perfect.
- What'll I do?

06:50.410 --> 06:53.778
- Jump the tape ahead?
- Roger. Pick it up at 12.7.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.947
'That'll be when
we were tied inside'

06:55.949 --> 06:57.648
'that grisly torture van.'

06:57.650 --> 07:00.218
12.7, here it goes.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.553
'Oh, let 'em fall.'

07:02.555 --> 07:03.521
The same voice.

07:03.523 --> 07:06.324
I don't believe it.
Susie?

07:06.326 --> 07:06.991
Quick, both tapes.

07:06.993 --> 07:10.361
Let's run them again,
back to back.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.965
'Am I ever glad
to see you two.'

07:13.967 --> 07:16.634
'Oh, let 'em fall.'

07:16.636 --> 07:19.670
Holy Benedict Arnold, Susie!

07:19.672 --> 07:21.239
Our chief cheerleader.

07:21.241 --> 07:24.742
A member of the Joker's
criminal gang!

07:24.744 --> 07:27.411
Is it possible, Batman?

07:27.413 --> 07:28.512
Steady, Robin.

07:28.514 --> 07:29.547
Steady, old chum.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.015
But how can it be?

07:31.017 --> 07:33.417
It's an old story,
I'm afraid.

07:33.419 --> 07:35.019
Old as Eve and the apple.

07:35.021 --> 07:40.258
That snake, the Joker must have
promised her some baubles.

07:40.260 --> 07:40.825
Led her astray.

07:40.827 --> 07:43.594
But what are
we gonna do, Batman?

07:43.596 --> 07:46.030
It's bitter...
but it's a break.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.565
The first one we've had.

07:47.567 --> 07:48.933
We'll have to use it.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.835
You're right.
Only how?

07:50.837 --> 07:56.440
Let's see, today is
a school holiday, isn't it?

07:56.442 --> 07:58.409
Where does that cute
little trickster

07:58.411 --> 07:59.410
happen to be hanging out?

07:59.412 --> 08:01.846
I know.
The Easy Living Candy Store.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.582
It's on East 3rd,
two blocks from school.

08:04.584 --> 08:09.420
Get set, Robin.
Get set for an ugly job.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.756
No, correction.

08:11.758 --> 08:12.857
What?

08:12.859 --> 08:13.758
Not Robin..

08:13.760 --> 08:17.395
Dick...Dick Grayson,
undercover agent.

08:17.397 --> 08:21.532
'His job is to get
inside that gang.'

08:38.017 --> 08:40.851
Dog George to Batman,
do you read me?

08:40.852 --> 08:42.419
'Do you read me, Batman?'

08:42.422 --> 08:43.921
Loud and clear, over.

08:43.923 --> 08:44.822
'I'm about to go in.'

08:44.824 --> 08:47.458
'How's the micro-TV
camera working.'

08:47.460 --> 08:50.594
- Push button for test pattern.
- Roger.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.567
Bat-scope a-okay,
Dog George.

08:56.569 --> 08:59.804
Rendezvous in Bat-cave
at end of mission.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.840
'Good luck.
Over and out.'

09:10.883 --> 09:15.353
Good gravy, it's Dick Grayson,
president of the school council!

09:15.355 --> 09:18.889
A goodnik like that?
Coming in here?

09:21.994 --> 09:25.496
Hiya, Sue-baby.

09:25.498 --> 09:26.764
How's tricks?

09:26.766 --> 09:27.998
I must be seeing things.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.434
I thought you spent all
your spare time studying.

09:30.436 --> 09:34.438
Oh, sure, I used to, maybe.
But, uh, who needs it anymore?

09:34.440 --> 09:38.542
You're looking at a guy
who's seen the light, Sue-baby.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.544
Who's the boyfriend?

09:40.546 --> 09:41.846
Oh, my friends call me Nick.

09:41.848 --> 09:44.515
'No kidding. What do
your enemies call you?'

09:44.517 --> 09:46.851
'My enemies ain't
in no condition'

09:46.853 --> 09:49.086
'to call nobody nothin'.'

09:49.088 --> 09:51.989
Some joker, isn't he?

09:54.594 --> 09:57.895
Uh, you looking
for something, Dicky boy?

09:57.897 --> 09:59.830
Same as everyone else,
Sue-baby.

10:00.232 --> 10:02.399
Some way of making
an easy buck, that's all.

10:02.401 --> 10:05.936
You, the ward of that rich
millionaire, Bruce Wayne?

10:05.938 --> 10:06.837
'What a skinflint.'

10:06.839 --> 10:08.806
If I didn't swipe dimes
from the butler

10:08.808 --> 10:10.374
I wouldn't even have
cigarette money.

10:10.376 --> 10:14.578
Why, here...
Have one on me, buster.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.581
Oh, thanks, pal.

10:22.354 --> 10:26.456
'I better pass this round,
I already had two packs today.'

10:26.458 --> 10:29.560
So, how's the easy buck setup?
Got any leads?

10:29.562 --> 10:32.062
'You know, he might be
able to help us, Nick.'

10:32.064 --> 10:35.065
- He's a real super athlete.
- Oh, is that so?

10:35.067 --> 10:37.000
You oughta see him
climb and stuff.

10:37.002 --> 10:39.036
Maybe I should
introduce him to--

10:39.038 --> 10:40.337
Zip your lip, baby.

10:40.339 --> 10:41.839
Introduce me to who, Susie?

10:41.841 --> 10:44.274
- Hey, you want a tip, buster?
- Yeah.

10:44.276 --> 10:47.344
Oh, there was a cocktail
lounge stuck up recently.

10:47.346 --> 10:48.879
These guys used
that trick jukebox.

10:48.881 --> 10:51.915
Yeah, I heard about that.
Some cute caper.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.217
Yeah, well, here's my tip.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.118
You go down to that same joint

10:55.120 --> 10:56.954
'at exactly 3pm today'

10:56.956 --> 11:00.190
'you might pick yourself
some nickels and dimes.'

11:00.192 --> 11:01.859
- Thanks, pal.
- That's my tip.

11:01.861 --> 11:02.860
I'll see you around, huh?

11:02.862 --> 11:05.463
Oh, yeah,
you'll see me around.

11:05.465 --> 11:08.065
So long, Sue-baby.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.637
Gee, Nick, what's the idea?

11:13.639 --> 11:16.740
Why, you gorgeous,
dumb hunk of cheerleader.

11:16.742 --> 11:20.144
Couldn't you see?
That guy is strictly a phony.

11:20.146 --> 11:20.911
What do you mean?

11:20.913 --> 11:22.947
Already had
two packs today, huh?

11:22.949 --> 11:24.248
My blind grandmother
could see.

11:24.250 --> 11:30.821
That guy never had a weed
in his hand in his life.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.799
Good gravy.

11:46.507 --> 11:48.874
How'd I do, Batman?

11:48.876 --> 11:51.576
Good show, Robin.
Darn good show.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.778
It's 20 minutes to three.
We'd better hurry up

11:53.780 --> 11:56.281
if we're gonna trap them
in that cocktail lounge.

11:56.283 --> 11:59.050
Right you are.
Let's go.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.925
<i> A trap indeed!</i>

12:06.927 --> 12:08.126
<i> But who's the mouse?</i>

12:08.128 --> 12:12.731
<i> For, in the lurid lair of</i>
<i> that criminal cat, the Joker..</i>

12:12.733 --> 12:17.602
My favorite kind of joke,
one which ends in a bang.

12:17.604 --> 12:21.640
Right. Now, what about Susie?

12:23.677 --> 12:27.646
Has she filled
the milk machine again?

12:27.648 --> 12:31.016
She's just getting ready.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.685
Uh, Susie, sweetie.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.988
A special extra bonus.

12:36.990 --> 12:40.559
A half pint bottle
of the most exquisite

12:40.561 --> 12:43.962
imported Canadian perfume.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.764
Wow! Canadian perfume.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.300
It's called,
"<i> Une nuit sans fin."</i>

12:48.302 --> 12:50.869
One endless night.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.838
Gee, that's like poetry.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.606
No, Susie, no.

12:54.608 --> 12:58.843
Do not open until after you've
loaded the milk machine.

12:58.845 --> 12:59.678
Do you understand?

12:59.680 --> 13:02.581
Oh, sure, Joker,
anything you say.

13:02.583 --> 13:06.718
You're just the best boss
any crook ever had.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.286
Oh, thank you.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.323
Hey, Joker, it's 3:00.

13:13.660 --> 13:18.296
Batman's zero hour.
Watch for the green light.

13:35.882 --> 13:39.851
Back! Everybody,
back at the bar.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.020
We gotta have room
to throw our Bat-arangs

13:42.022 --> 13:45.390
when the crooks
come in for the loot.

13:51.965 --> 13:55.100
Ready with the coin, Robin?

13:55.102 --> 13:56.901
Ready.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.371
Zero hour.

13:59.373 --> 14:01.172
Put it in the slot.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.907
Roger.

14:14.921 --> 14:17.856
Batman's funeral dirge begins.

14:17.858 --> 14:21.159
I give him five seconds.

14:23.797 --> 14:24.396
Now!

14:24.398 --> 14:27.999
'The joke's on you,
my cheery booze hounds.'

14:28.001 --> 14:33.405
'It's a stick up!
Hands up, you coward.'

14:34.241 --> 14:36.374
Surprise, Batman!

14:36.376 --> 14:39.010
Quick, Robin,
down behind the Bat-shield.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.379
'Surprise and goodnight!'

14:55.362 --> 14:58.830
Holy hailstorm. You knew
this was gonna happen.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.832
Or something like it.
You see, Robin.

15:00.834 --> 15:04.135
You betrayed yourself
in that candy store.

15:04.137 --> 15:04.736
How?

15:04.738 --> 15:06.871
Despite your boast,
it was painfully evident

15:06.873 --> 15:08.106
that you're not a smoker.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.974
Nick must've seen
you were working

15:09.976 --> 15:11.076
hand in hand with the police.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.912
- Gee, Batman, I'm sorry.
- 'Don't be silly.'

15:13.914 --> 15:15.780
It's to your credit that

15:15.782 --> 15:17.315
that charade failed.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.317
The thing now
is to save Susie.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.385
- Save Susie?
- 'Work it out.'

15:20.387 --> 15:25.056
Why would an undercover agent
try to pump her?

15:25.859 --> 15:27.959
Because I knew
she was one of the gang.

15:27.961 --> 15:31.162
Right. And once they know
that we know

15:31.164 --> 15:34.299
that young lady's life
isn't worth a plugged lollypop.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.168
Holy murder!
We gotta find her quick.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.770
Where? Back at the store?

15:38.772 --> 15:41.005
- School.
- On Saturday?

15:41.007 --> 15:42.941
She'll be in the gym
practicing cheers.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.442
Of course.
Tonight, there's a big game.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.945
Woodrow Roosevelt
against Disko Tech.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.414
Let's hurry, Batman.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.089
Bartender, a bit of advice.

15:58.091 --> 16:02.494
Always inspect
a jukebox carefully.

16:02.496 --> 16:05.430
These machines can be deadly.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.037
Hello.

16:13.039 --> 16:13.772
Yeah. Right.

16:13.774 --> 16:15.874
Yeah, just a sec.
He's right here.

16:15.876 --> 16:17.842
Joker. Joker it's for you.

16:17.844 --> 16:18.810
It's Las Vegas.

16:18.812 --> 16:22.447
- Pete, the Swede.
- Ah.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.516
Hello, Pete, the Swede.

16:24.518 --> 16:27.986
What's the line
on the big game tonight?

16:28.855 --> 16:31.222
The odds are 20 to 1?

16:31.224 --> 16:32.891
On Woodrow Roosevelt High?

16:32.893 --> 16:34.359
Oh, what a killin'.

16:34.361 --> 16:37.262
Uh, take a whimsical wager.

16:37.264 --> 16:41.566
$50,000 on Disko Tech.

16:42.135 --> 16:45.303
Yes, Pete, the Swede,
you heard me.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.438
Disko Tech.

16:47.941 --> 16:51.943
Fifty times twenty.
One million bucks.

16:51.945 --> 16:54.179
Oh, how delicious!

16:56.349 --> 16:59.217
<i> What? Bet against these champs?</i>

16:59.219 --> 17:03.588
<i> The clown prince of crime</i>
<i> must have slipped a cog.</i>

17:03.590 --> 17:05.924

17:05.925 --> 17:07.025

17:22.108 --> 17:25.210
Okay, kids,
let's take a break. Huh?

17:25.945 --> 17:29.981
Gee, too bad that Magic Milk
machine's out of order.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.159
Susie, stop.
Give yourself up.

17:41.161 --> 17:44.329
Your life's in danger, Susie.
The Joker knows we're on to you.

17:44.331 --> 17:47.265
He's discard you without mercy
like an old shoe.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.634
Have you guys stripped
your gears?

17:49.636 --> 17:51.469
'Quick. Catch her.'

17:54.274 --> 17:56.975
So long, dynamic duo.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.615
Poisoned.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.019
- Dead.
- Are you sure?

18:08.021 --> 18:12.090
Yeah, I saw 'em loading her on a
meat wagon from the city morgue.

18:12.092 --> 18:15.059
The Boy Wonder was bawlin'
his head off.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.261
Oh, well.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.997
Well, it had to be done,
my Bad Pennies.

18:18.999 --> 18:20.598
What's the death
of a greedy little dupe?

18:20.600 --> 18:26.271
This life, at best,
is one long impractical joke.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.540
Have a memorial cigar.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.976
Why, thank you, Joker.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.349
The brief shadow has lifted.

18:38.351 --> 18:41.352
I am my own humorous self again.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.954
What's the hour?

18:42.956 --> 18:43.421
5:22.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.223
Quick. Cameras. Disguises.

18:45.225 --> 18:48.326
It's time
for my greatest strike.

18:56.536 --> 19:00.238
Okay, drop in.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.172
One more.

19:01.174 --> 19:05.209
Okay fellas, let's knock it off
before we go stale.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.277
Right you are, Cap.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.613
We'll quit while we've
got our sharp edge.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.581
Yeah, we'll beat 'em
by 50 points.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.216
We'll do it for Susie, right?

19:12.218 --> 19:14.218
- Right.
- Come on.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.990
The "out of order" sign's
gone off the milk machine.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.558
Oh boy, it must be fixed.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.093
Hey, who's got a dime?

19:22.095 --> 19:23.528
Here, I got one.

19:31.237 --> 19:32.036
What the heck?

19:32.038 --> 19:35.139
This machine's
been fixed, alright.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.041
Good gosh.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.010
These are next week's
nation-wide

19:39.012 --> 19:40.044
pre-college exam papers.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.980
Complete with
the answers written in.

19:42.682 --> 19:47.151
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
Dear me. How disillusioning.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.653
The champs are cheats.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.254
'Caught red-handed
with the answers'

19:50.256 --> 19:53.458
'to the nation-wide
pre-college exams.'

19:53.460 --> 19:54.092
The Joker.

19:54.094 --> 19:56.327
At the moment,
merely an honest citizen.

19:56.329 --> 20:01.132
We was passing by to inspect
this here school property

20:01.134 --> 20:03.201
which we support
with our taxes.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.136
And imagine our surprise.

20:05.138 --> 20:05.770
We're not cheats.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.539
No, it's a typical filthy
Joker's trick.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.742
It hardly matters, boys.
Now, does it?

20:10.744 --> 20:13.244
When the board of education
sees this picture

20:13.246 --> 20:16.781
with you holding the answer
to those exams..

20:16.783 --> 20:18.016
'Ho, ho, ho, ho.'

20:18.018 --> 20:19.384
Good gosh, we'll be suspended.

20:19.386 --> 20:22.520
We won't be allowed to play
Disko Tech tonight.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.222
Oh, well.

20:25.025 --> 20:28.159
I'm sure the scrubs
will do their best.

20:28.161 --> 20:30.495
The scrubs? They'll be creamed.

20:30.497 --> 20:33.564
Oh, so sad, so sad.

20:33.566 --> 20:37.735
And after Batman's lectures
to you about honesty.

20:37.737 --> 20:42.106
What on earth
will the caper crusader say?

20:42.108 --> 20:45.076
'Ball players.
'Run for cover.'

20:46.246 --> 20:49.380
Don't worry about having seen
those exam papers.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.314
They're a fake.

20:50.316 --> 20:51.416
'We planted them'

20:51.418 --> 20:53.317
'and the Joker's picture
doesn't mean a thing.'

20:53.319 --> 20:57.422
We saved Susie's life by using
the Universal Antidote pills

20:57.424 --> 20:58.523
in our utility belts.

20:58.525 --> 21:03.261
She repaid us by revealing
the whole criminal scheme.

21:03.263 --> 21:07.465
Okay, Batman.
Let's deliver the punch line.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.089
Tough luck, Bad Pennies.

21:31.091 --> 21:32.256
You're out of circulation.

21:32.258 --> 21:35.193
They'll melt you down
in a pan.

21:54.147 --> 21:54.879
'Holy new year's eve.'

21:54.881 --> 21:58.516
He's got me in his
famous trick streamers.

22:00.186 --> 22:03.654
Have a sneeze on me,
Batman.

22:06.292 --> 22:06.858
No use, Joker.

22:06.860 --> 22:10.194
I knew you'd employ
your sneezing powder.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.896
So I took an anti-allergy pill.

22:11.898 --> 22:17.168
Instead of a sneeze,
I've caught you...cold.

22:31.518 --> 22:34.519
That's what easy living
gets you kids.

22:34.521 --> 22:35.786
Stick to your books.

22:35.788 --> 22:39.390
And good luck
against Disko Tech.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.803
Well, I guess
it's goodbye, Susie.

22:52.873 --> 22:54.973
- Goodbye, Dick.
- I give you my word.

22:54.975 --> 22:58.543
I'll mail you the new cheers
as soon as they're made up.

22:58.545 --> 23:01.613
You can practice 'em
while you're away.

23:02.115 --> 23:05.784
- Gosh.
- What's the matter?

23:05.786 --> 23:08.086
You've all been so nice to me.

23:08.088 --> 23:09.054
I can hardly bear it.

23:09.056 --> 23:11.022
Heck, Susie,
it wasn't all your fault.

23:11.024 --> 23:12.891
I mean, with your
unhappy childhood

23:12.893 --> 23:14.493
in a broken home
and everything.

23:14.495 --> 23:18.830
No wonder you fell for that
crook's phony promises.

23:20.934 --> 23:22.734
It's time, Susie.

23:22.736 --> 23:25.570
The chauffeur is waiting.

23:32.012 --> 23:37.682
Gee. Imagine being taken
to jail by a chauffeur.

23:38.218 --> 23:40.585
The Wayne Foundation for
Delinquent Girls

23:40.587 --> 23:41.520
is hardly a jail, Susie.

23:41.522 --> 23:45.123
Heck, no. There's teams
and clubs and everything.

23:45.959 --> 23:48.827
I don't know
what to say to you both.

23:48.829 --> 23:51.463
I just..

23:53.834 --> 23:54.867
Thanks, Dick

23:54.869 --> 23:56.835
You're welcome, Susie.

23:57.237 --> 24:00.071
I'll have nightmares
all my life, Mr. Wayne.

24:00.073 --> 24:02.774
'If it hadn't been
for that power failure'

24:02.776 --> 24:04.109
'where would Robin be?'

24:04.111 --> 24:06.778
And where would Batman be?

24:06.780 --> 24:08.947
- Where would Dick Grayson be?
- Huh?

24:08.949 --> 24:10.815
'Don't think about it,
young people.'

24:10.817 --> 24:12.684
Just be thankful
that life is..

24:12.686 --> 24:16.555
.. filled with unanswered
questions, that's all.

24:16.558 --> 24:18.224
Goodbye, Susie.

24:18.226 --> 24:20.026
Goodbye.
