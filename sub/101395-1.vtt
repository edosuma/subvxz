01:06.894 --> 01:09.272
What you doing on your ass?

01:12.608 --> 01:14.276
You're still breathing
though, right?

01:22.993 --> 01:25.580
This is what people
call a teachable moment.

01:25.622 --> 01:26.874
You know what that means?

01:28.333 --> 01:30.127
They call it that
because these are

01:30.169 --> 01:32.170
the moments that
shape who we are.

01:33.839 --> 01:36.048
Of all the pain and heartache
in the years to come,

01:36.091 --> 01:39.344
this is when we first
learn how to cope.

01:42.222 --> 01:44.515
You better look at me
when I'm talking to you.

01:47.351 --> 01:50.482
Whenever you start to
feel like you can't go on,

01:50.522 --> 01:52.566
you keep in mind that
all that negativity

01:52.608 --> 01:54.485
ain't coming from
your physical body.

01:55.611 --> 01:56.988
It's all up here, girl.

01:58.114 --> 01:59.991
Your body will always
fight against you,

02:00.033 --> 02:02.034
that's what it was
designed to do.

02:03.661 --> 02:04.495
Don't let it.

02:06.873 --> 02:07.957
This is your vessel.

02:09.083 --> 02:09.917
Your tool.

02:11.461 --> 02:14.340
It doesn't tell you what to
do, it's the other way around.

02:16.049 --> 02:17.510
It really hurts.

02:18.385 --> 02:20.012
Maybe it does.

02:20.054 --> 02:21.764
Years from now it
might still hurt.

02:23.139 --> 02:24.975
But are you gonna tell people
that you hurt your knee

02:25.017 --> 02:27.645
because you fell down once,
or are you gonna tell people

02:27.685 --> 02:30.397
that you fell down, but
in spite of the pain,

02:30.439 --> 02:33.191
you pulled yourself
off the ground,

02:33.233 --> 02:36.279
you pushed on, and
you persevered?

02:42.619 --> 02:43.578
Now get on up.

02:45.079 --> 02:46.330
Clock's still running.

04:41.118 --> 04:42.284
You look like hell.

04:51.877 --> 04:52.878
It's good to see you.

06:40.282 --> 06:42.076
I was watching that.

06:42.118 --> 06:43.452
Bullshit.

06:43.495 --> 06:44.538
You were snoring.

06:50.043 --> 06:50.961
You feel better?

06:52.169 --> 06:53.671
You smell better, at least.

07:04.350 --> 07:05.184
What?

07:06.393 --> 07:08.270
Just trying to figure
it all out, I guess.

07:09.939 --> 07:11.523
Well let me know how it goes.

07:17.530 --> 07:19.323
What's it like out there?

07:24.913 --> 07:25.747
Exhausting.

07:26.873 --> 07:28.875
Come on, Mel.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.127
400 miles I've
been following you,

07:31.170 --> 07:33.505
and while you're out having
your grand adventure,

07:33.546 --> 07:36.799
I'm stuck in the car all day
waiting for you to show up.

07:36.841 --> 07:38.676
We've got a long way to go yet.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.512
Give me something to go on.

07:43.682 --> 07:45.601
I run, I eat, I sleep.

07:45.642 --> 07:48.438
There's rocks, trees,
dirt, miles and miles,

07:48.479 --> 07:49.563
and no end in sight.

07:51.482 --> 07:52.900
I haven't found God or anything,

07:52.941 --> 07:54.401
if that's what you're asking.

07:54.443 --> 07:55.694
What do you want from me?

07:59.448 --> 08:01.909
Probably best if we
both get some sleep.

08:03.328 --> 08:05.746
You think you're tired, try
raising a three-year-old.

08:09.958 --> 08:12.003
Can you turn the TV back on?

08:13.254 --> 08:14.672
Can't fall asleep without it.

09:20.824 --> 09:21.992
I come bearing gifts.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.419
Too bad we need it.

09:35.799 --> 09:37.259
It's a bear bell.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.719
You wear it on your pack
to ward off black bears.

09:41.305 --> 09:43.431
I read about it on the internet.

09:43.474 --> 09:45.309
I also read that singing
at the top of your lungs

09:45.349 --> 09:46.517
as you hike works too.

09:55.152 --> 09:56.821
Oh, one more thing.

09:57.989 --> 09:59.490
Ah, come on, I
already told you.

09:59.532 --> 10:02.243
It's prepaid, for emergencies.

10:02.284 --> 10:03.452
Just in case.

10:03.494 --> 10:04.703
It's useless.

10:04.745 --> 10:05.662
I won't even have
service out there.

10:05.705 --> 10:08.249
I'm not asking for much.

10:08.291 --> 10:09.709
Just hold onto it.

10:10.585 --> 10:12.212
It'll make me feel better, okay?

10:16.174 --> 10:17.008
Thank you.

10:32.316 --> 10:33.234
Mm-mm, nah.

11:12.858 --> 11:16.612
I've got 200 miles to go before
the next support stop-off.

11:16.654 --> 11:18.405
If weather holds up, I
should be able to make it

11:18.448 --> 11:19.281
in eight days.

11:22.660 --> 11:24.287
Mom told me to tell you
you're wasting your life,

11:24.329 --> 11:25.622
by the way.

11:25.663 --> 11:27.165
What a refreshing
change of pace.

11:27.206 --> 11:30.209
Give her a break, she feels
like everyone abandoned her.

11:38.969 --> 11:40.929
It is so quiet.

11:42.138 --> 11:43.639
Is anybody else out there?

11:44.724 --> 11:46.642
Too early in the season.

11:46.685 --> 11:47.936
Most of the
through-hikers have been

11:47.979 --> 11:49.980
in the trail head by now.

11:50.023 --> 11:52.149
Nobody could ever
keep up with you.

11:56.236 --> 11:58.113
I know you don't
wanna hear this,

11:58.156 --> 12:00.950
but I'm your sister, so
I'm gonna tell you anyway.

12:00.991 --> 12:04.161
You don't have to prove
anything to anyone now.

12:04.204 --> 12:05.580
Him least of all.

12:36.279 --> 12:38.280
Maybe at the next
location, you'll consider

12:38.323 --> 12:39.908
taking an extra day.

12:39.949 --> 12:42.701
We can get some real food,
maybe a couple drinks?

12:44.411 --> 12:45.663
And we're getting
a better place.

12:45.704 --> 12:47.498
Somewhere with a
goddamn hot tub.

12:47.540 --> 12:50.084
You might enjoy all this
masochistic caveman shit,

12:50.126 --> 12:52.753
but as far as I'm
concerned, I'm on vacation.

12:53.587 --> 12:54.421
We'll see.

13:04.516 --> 13:05.725
Promise me you'll call.

13:07.435 --> 13:09.437
See you in eight days.

17:27.330 --> 17:28.249
You okay?

17:30.252 --> 17:32.463
Yeah, it's nothin'.

17:32.503 --> 17:34.755
Just my dogs are barkin' is all.

17:34.798 --> 17:36.467
Looks more like
they're biting.

17:40.345 --> 17:41.680
These are pretty bad.

17:43.182 --> 17:44.016
Yeah.

18:05.330 --> 18:06.956
I'm gone for five
minutes and you manage

18:06.997 --> 18:07.998
to pick up a stray.

18:09.583 --> 18:11.002
She was
just passing by.

18:11.044 --> 18:13.505
She stopped by to
give me a hand.

18:13.546 --> 18:14.547
Mighty considerate.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.511
Personally I'd have just
left him where he lay.

18:18.552 --> 18:20.428
Still thinking about
it, to be honest.

18:25.892 --> 18:27.310
Not ideal hiking wear.

18:27.352 --> 18:28.187
Yeah.

18:29.563 --> 18:31.398
Might've bit off a little
more than I can chew.

18:32.733 --> 18:34.735
Didn't think we'd be
stuck out here this long.

18:37.613 --> 18:38.989
You want me to
take a look at that?

18:39.032 --> 18:40.408
I've got a first aid kid.

18:40.449 --> 18:41.867
He just sprained it.

18:41.910 --> 18:43.536
He tripped over a log.

18:43.577 --> 18:44.411
Clumsy me.

18:47.582 --> 18:51.795
You know, I got a few
dozen sprains of my own.

18:52.962 --> 18:55.256
Stress fractures and
shin splints too.

18:58.426 --> 18:59.303
Congratulations.

19:00.680 --> 19:04.142
Funny thing is, through
all those injuries,

19:04.182 --> 19:06.602
I've never once seen
a sprain bleed before.

19:11.940 --> 19:14.110
I'd recommend you
clean whatever that is.

19:14.151 --> 19:15.569
And change the bandages.

19:18.447 --> 19:19.532
Just my two cents.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.247
Try to keep off those feet.

19:25.288 --> 19:27.790
Maybe next time invest in
a pair of hiking boots?

19:32.962 --> 19:34.338
Thanks.

23:01.806 --> 23:03.141
Morning.

23:03.181 --> 23:04.016
Hey.

23:05.517 --> 23:08.520
Sorry if we startled you,
we rolled in pretty late.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.356
Didn't hear you
come in is all.

23:14.527 --> 23:15.777
You afraid that
thing's gonna walk off

23:15.819 --> 23:18.155
in the middle of
the night or what?

23:18.197 --> 23:20.032
I don't carry a bear bat.

23:20.074 --> 23:21.284
This way if I know
if anything comes

23:21.325 --> 23:23.745
rifling through my
pack looking for food.

23:23.787 --> 23:24.872
That's smart.

23:24.912 --> 23:25.913
It is at that.

23:40.636 --> 23:41.846
Something wrong?

23:43.390 --> 23:44.349
I was just thinking about how

23:44.391 --> 23:46.560
you helped out Jared yesterday.

23:46.602 --> 23:48.104
You were off into
the wild yonder

23:48.145 --> 23:50.190
even before he got a
chance to thank you.

23:53.192 --> 23:54.777
Got a schedule to keep is all.

23:56.069 --> 23:57.362
You seem pretty focused.

23:57.404 --> 23:59.449
Running like the
dickens as I recall.

24:01.158 --> 24:03.076
Ain't that right, Jared?

24:03.118 --> 24:05.413
Like the ever-lovin' dickens.

24:05.454 --> 24:06.538
That's what I said.

24:08.165 --> 24:10.250
Didn't think we'd ever
catch up with you.

24:15.840 --> 24:16.758
Pretty hardcore.

24:17.926 --> 24:19.552
Camping out here
without any gear.

24:21.763 --> 24:23.556
What are you guys, day hikers?

24:26.769 --> 24:29.145
I guess you could say
that we're more purists.

24:30.940 --> 24:32.691
We like to rough it.

24:32.732 --> 24:35.194
We're a little out
of our element here.

24:35.236 --> 24:36.779
Speak for yourself, Pop.

24:51.418 --> 24:53.213
You're smothering it.

24:53.254 --> 24:55.799
Give it room to
breathe, till it takes.

24:55.840 --> 24:57.800
Then add the big stuff.

24:58.970 --> 25:00.429
That's what I
keep tellin' him.

25:10.063 --> 25:11.439
So where you off
to in such a hurry?

25:11.482 --> 25:12.733
I got a lot of miles today.

25:12.774 --> 25:14.526
You haven't even
had breakfast yet.

25:15.695 --> 25:17.362
Go on, then.

25:17.405 --> 25:18.406
Pop a squat.

25:19.447 --> 25:20.740
We won't trouble you none.

25:41.638 --> 25:42.889
What kinda knife is that?

25:43.806 --> 25:44.640
Fixed blade?

25:56.653 --> 25:57.988
You keep it sharp.

25:58.031 --> 25:59.866
Kinda the whole
point, isn't it?

26:05.496 --> 26:07.039
So, what's your deal?

26:08.166 --> 26:09.626
What do you mean?

26:09.667 --> 26:12.045
You just seem like somebody
that's got someplace else

26:12.086 --> 26:13.004
they'd rather be.

26:15.048 --> 26:16.883
Like I'd rather
be alone, you mean?

26:16.926 --> 26:18.218
No.

26:18.259 --> 26:20.054
No, it's more than that.

26:21.930 --> 26:23.473
Most people that come
out to places like this

26:23.516 --> 26:26.185
are lookin' for a sense
of peace and quiet.

26:27.727 --> 26:29.395
They're sort of calm, I guess.

26:31.064 --> 26:33.191
What makes you
think I'm not calm?

26:35.195 --> 26:37.364
You seem like a
pretty intense person.

26:38.573 --> 26:40.242
Restless maybe, I don't know.

26:40.283 --> 26:41.117
No offense.

26:42.285 --> 26:46.372
The trail, all this,
has nothing to do

26:46.413 --> 26:48.123
with why I'm out here.

26:48.165 --> 26:49.708
It's the distance I'm after.

26:49.750 --> 26:50.584
I see.

26:54.256 --> 26:55.841
I guess it's in our
nature to do things

26:55.882 --> 26:57.383
that aren't in our nature.

26:58.553 --> 26:59.387
Yeah.

27:02.806 --> 27:04.767
What's that supposed to be?

27:08.563 --> 27:09.689
It's a train whistle.

27:38.509 --> 27:39.677
I really need
to hit the trail.

27:39.720 --> 27:40.929
Daylight's wasting.

27:40.970 --> 27:42.388
Hey, you know, maybe
we could tag along.

27:42.431 --> 27:44.391
You guys would
just slow me down.

27:44.432 --> 27:45.349
If you don't mind.

27:48.645 --> 27:49.981
Aww, shucks.

27:51.148 --> 27:53.358
I was just startin' to
grow fond of the thing.

27:55.819 --> 27:57.864
You know what?

27:57.905 --> 27:58.740
Keep it.

28:00.116 --> 28:00.908
Hey, can't...

28:00.950 --> 28:01.826
Back off!

28:01.867 --> 28:03.285
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:03.327 --> 28:05.872
Look, can't you see that
we're desperate here, okay?

28:05.914 --> 28:07.414
Like I can barely walk, and I,

28:07.456 --> 28:09.500
you can't just leave
us out here, please.

28:10.836 --> 28:12.671
You're being rude
to my friend there.

28:13.880 --> 28:15.131
I'm leaving.

28:15.174 --> 28:16.634
You're in my way.

28:16.674 --> 28:17.635
Hey, this doesn't have
to get out of hand, okay?

28:17.675 --> 28:18.468
Let's just calm...

28:18.511 --> 28:19.970
Fuck that.

28:20.011 --> 28:21.804
You wanna leave, go ahead.

28:22.681 --> 28:24.225
But we're keeping the pack.

28:25.392 --> 28:26.936
Maybe you can just
give us some food,

28:26.976 --> 28:30.563
or your first aid kit, we're
just looking for a break here.

28:30.606 --> 28:31.440
Please?

28:40.575 --> 28:41.368
Hey, wait!

28:41.408 --> 28:42.368
No, stop.

28:42.409 --> 28:44.662
You're just making this worse!

28:46.705 --> 28:48.500
Please, stop!

28:48.541 --> 28:49.376
Stop it!

28:57.675 --> 28:59.553
You done playing grab-ass?

29:21.951 --> 29:23.120
I can't fucking run like this.

29:23.161 --> 29:25.163
You watch that
goddamn mouth of yours.

29:26.873 --> 29:28.416
It ain't work if it ain't hard.

29:29.626 --> 29:31.962
You have no idea what
your body's capable of

29:32.004 --> 29:33.880
until you've felt
the absolute limit

29:33.921 --> 29:35.923
of what you think is
physically possible.

29:37.606 --> 29:40.715
Until you reach that point,
you're just making excuses.

29:40.762 --> 29:42.389
What if I faint?

29:47.937 --> 29:50.648
Then you will know
what your limits are,

29:52.734 --> 29:54.776
and figure out how
to push past them.

30:24.391 --> 30:26.936
This isn't how it's
supposed to be, man.

30:26.977 --> 30:30.439
Nice and quiet, that's what
we said, that's what we said.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.314
In and out.

30:32.983 --> 30:34.151
What do you want from me?

30:34.192 --> 30:36.070
She had the goddamn
thing tied to her wrist.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.745
What did you think was
gonna happen?

30:43.786 --> 30:46.623
This isn't exactly
keeping a low profile, man.

30:46.664 --> 30:48.874
Don't you think we're
in enough shit as is,

30:48.917 --> 30:50.877
without having a
goddamn hostage?

30:52.128 --> 30:53.797
Parker's not gonna like this.

30:53.838 --> 30:55.214
Fuck Parker.

30:56.173 --> 30:57.258
This doesn't change a thing.

30:57.299 --> 30:59.470
We still hold all the cards.

30:59.511 --> 31:00.762
Now quit your whining...

31:00.805 --> 31:03.391
No, I didn't sign
up for this, man.

31:03.431 --> 31:05.601
You wanna go runnin'
off hidin' in the woods

31:05.643 --> 31:07.812
for the rest of your life,
that's fine, I've had enough.

31:07.854 --> 31:09.604
Need I remind you
why you're here?

31:11.941 --> 31:13.526
I got nothin' to
lose, believe me.

31:15.193 --> 31:16.028
But you.

31:20.783 --> 31:21.617
Share it.

31:22.827 --> 31:24.579
50/50.

31:24.621 --> 31:26.038
That's what was agreed upon.

31:27.624 --> 31:31.711
Now, shut up, give me that.

31:31.752 --> 31:33.212
You're starting to
make me nervous.

31:48.730 --> 31:51.191
What are we
gonna do about her?

31:51.231 --> 31:53.401
We can't just drag
her along with us.

31:57.989 --> 31:59.240
No one has to find her.

32:00.241 --> 32:01.867
Not till this is long over with.

32:03.994 --> 32:05.120
No, no.

32:05.163 --> 32:07.080
Fuckin' crazy, man?

32:07.123 --> 32:09.876
We are not killing
her, you understand me?

32:09.917 --> 32:12.086
Relax.

32:12.128 --> 32:14.005
We'll just have
to leave her here.

32:15.424 --> 32:17.635
Buy us enough time to get
some distance under our heels.

32:19.595 --> 32:20.721
Scout's honor.

32:21.722 --> 32:22.598
All right.

32:22.639 --> 32:23.598
Not a hair on her head.

32:25.725 --> 32:26.726
All right.

32:36.070 --> 32:37.405
Where you think
you're goin', lady?

32:47.206 --> 32:48.624
You trying to steal from us?

32:57.341 --> 33:00.679
Your girlfriend here is quite
a crafty coos, ain't she?

33:14.985 --> 33:16.027
Let's go, sweetheart.

33:37.758 --> 33:38.801
Ups-a-daisy.

33:46.227 --> 33:47.227
Quit your wriggling.

33:48.688 --> 33:51.524
Get me some more
of that paracord.

33:53.484 --> 33:55.486
You already used
it all on her wrists.

33:57.988 --> 33:59.323
Don't put the cows to pasture

33:59.364 --> 34:01.074
when the slaughterhouse
is waitin'.

34:02.243 --> 34:03.870
That's what my
daddy used to say.

34:10.293 --> 34:12.378
Don't fuckin' touch me.

34:14.672 --> 34:15.591
Hey, hey.

34:18.010 --> 34:21.013
I told my friend here that
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

34:21.054 --> 34:23.514
I like to think of myself
as a man of my word.

34:23.556 --> 34:25.851
But you keep causin' a ruckus,

34:25.891 --> 34:27.728
and you'll make a
liar out of me yet.

34:32.233 --> 34:33.065
Now.

34:34.819 --> 34:37.989
That belt is comin' off,
one way or the other.

34:39.447 --> 34:41.909
Now I can cut it off you,
along with whatever else

34:41.951 --> 34:45.705
is in the way, or
you can keep still

34:46.871 --> 34:49.083
and be rid of us all
the sooner for it.

34:50.668 --> 34:52.295
Up to you, darlin'.

34:52.337 --> 34:53.295
But choose now.

34:54.505 --> 34:56.382
'Cause I'm not in then
mood to fuck around.

35:14.110 --> 35:15.486
Take this.

35:15.527 --> 35:16.528
Nice and tight.

35:35.464 --> 35:36.258
All right, enough.

35:36.299 --> 35:37.258
Let's fuckin' go, man.

35:45.725 --> 35:47.645
You mind your
manners while I'm gone.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.690
Daddy's gotta go to work.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.487
You better hope I don't
see you again, motherfucker!

36:01.242 --> 36:04.412
I'll be dreamin'
of you, sweetheart.

36:21.138 --> 36:22.681
I'll take that water.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.602
Don't take your eyes
off that fuckin' bag.

36:45.871 --> 36:49.583
This isn't what I wanted,
when I saw you the other day,

36:51.043 --> 36:54.714
and I am so sorry that you
got mixed up in all this.

36:54.755 --> 36:56.049
But like I said, we're...

36:56.090 --> 36:56.924
Desperate?

36:58.218 --> 36:59.387
Yeah.

36:59.428 --> 37:00.388
I got that.

37:06.602 --> 37:08.521
I just want you to understand.

37:10.314 --> 37:12.108
This is not the
type of person I am.

37:18.405 --> 37:19.239
You're right.

37:21.575 --> 37:23.495
You're a fuckin' coward.

38:23.140 --> 38:23.973
Fuck!

38:47.666 --> 38:49.209
Okay.

38:49.251 --> 38:51.002
Get it together, Mel.

38:52.003 --> 38:52.836
Get it.

44:21.555 --> 44:23.182
You wanna knock that shit off?

44:24.850 --> 44:26.352
Supposed to keep bears away.

44:27.436 --> 44:28.937
Nevermind the goddamn bears.

44:30.064 --> 44:31.482
Bears'd be the least
of your problems

44:31.524 --> 44:33.485
if you don't shut your lips
and give me some peace.

44:58.218 --> 45:00.012
You gonna answer it?

45:05.184 --> 45:06.017
Not yet.

45:10.314 --> 45:13.067
I wanna put a few miles
between us and the bloodhounds.

45:50.606 --> 45:51.940
You all right?

45:53.735 --> 45:54.568
Fuck off.

46:00.992 --> 46:04.996
Man, we're gonna drop
dead if we keep this up.

46:10.084 --> 46:10.919
Come on.

46:57.551 --> 46:59.845
Don't you think we
ought to address that?

46:59.886 --> 47:01.221
It's clearly bothering you.

47:02.598 --> 47:04.892
Why don't you worry about
your damn self, gimpy?

47:07.895 --> 47:10.022
Roll your sleeve
up, Mr. Badass.

47:35.132 --> 47:36.383
That thing gets
any more infected,

47:36.425 --> 47:38.343
we're gonna have to
lop off your whole arm.

47:38.384 --> 47:40.469
Just you try it,
you fuckin' asshole.

47:40.512 --> 47:42.389
I'll gut you and hang
you by your entrails.

47:42.431 --> 47:43.639
All right.

47:43.681 --> 47:45.684
I was just messin'
around, take it easy.

47:53.651 --> 47:55.695
Maybe we could build a fire
or something, burn it...

47:55.736 --> 47:56.528
No fire.

47:56.571 --> 47:57.363
It'd be easier to...

47:57.405 --> 47:59.323
No fire.

48:23.891 --> 48:24.724
Fuck.

48:39.115 --> 48:40.575
Move your fingers.

48:40.617 --> 48:41.910
There we go.

48:41.952 --> 48:42.785
All right.

48:43.619 --> 48:44.453
Good as new.

48:46.289 --> 48:47.122
Much obliged.

48:54.004 --> 48:55.506
Ow!

48:57.634 --> 48:58.468
You hear that?

49:00.763 --> 49:01.596
Yeah.

49:02.681 --> 49:03.848
Probably just a coyote.

49:13.484 --> 49:15.194
You know what would
keep 'em away?

49:16.654 --> 49:17.487
A fire!

50:49.459 --> 50:51.586
You smell that, you
little rat fuckers?!

50:53.421 --> 50:55.214
This is my territory!

50:56.299 --> 50:57.218
It's claimed.

50:58.802 --> 51:00.596
So stay the fuck away!

53:03.682 --> 53:04.891
I wanna share
something with you

53:04.934 --> 53:07.061
an old drill sergeant
taught us back in basic.

53:08.396 --> 53:10.064
Something called
the crack theory.

53:13.025 --> 53:16.445
The most miserable thing
about being out in the field

53:18.447 --> 53:20.907
is getting caught in the rain.

53:22.160 --> 53:25.538
Whenever it started up,
we would stop everything

53:25.580 --> 53:28.124
to get out a poncho, bring
out our socks, whatever.

53:30.419 --> 53:31.587
It's only natural
to want to keep

53:31.627 --> 53:33.254
from feeling the
discomfort of it.

53:35.256 --> 53:36.674
Right up until you
feel that water

53:36.716 --> 53:39.427
dripping down the
crack of your ass.

53:40.636 --> 53:43.556
At that point it simply
becomes a part of life.

53:43.598 --> 53:45.017
You're forced to give it up.

53:48.103 --> 53:49.396
But even before
the rain ever came,

53:49.438 --> 53:52.190
he had us take out our canteens,

53:52.233 --> 53:54.110
turn 'em over on
top of our heads.

53:55.778 --> 53:58.781
Then we crawled out into the
dirt until we were caked in it.

54:00.949 --> 54:02.910
See what I'm gettin' at?

54:04.369 --> 54:06.914
By the time we were done, we
were already soaked through

54:06.956 --> 54:09.460
as much as we
could possibly get.

54:13.964 --> 54:16.592
We accepted our condition.

54:18.636 --> 54:20.512
Dropped the pretense
of making anything

54:20.553 --> 54:22.222
easier for ourselves.

54:23.473 --> 54:27.602
And we were free to do
what we needed to do,

54:28.979 --> 54:31.357
without another thought
about our personal comfort.

54:35.445 --> 54:40.450
Sometimes it's best to just
embrace the discomfort.

54:42.494 --> 54:44.412
To truly immerse yourself in it.

54:50.501 --> 54:55.507
We are not here to make
it easy for ourselves.

55:01.805 --> 55:04.140
You gotta have the training.

56:38.990 --> 56:40.575
I ain't gonna tell you again.

56:41.785 --> 56:43.578
That fuckin' bag leaves
your back one more time,

56:43.619 --> 56:46.538
I'm gonna staple the goddamn
thing to your shoulder blades.

56:48.041 --> 56:48.874
Keep it on.

57:01.596 --> 57:02.765
We're never gonna get anywhere,

57:02.806 --> 57:04.808
you keep poppin' a
squat every 30 steps.

57:06.268 --> 57:09.729
However did I wind up stuck
with such a blubbering pussy?

57:09.772 --> 57:10.940
It's embarrassing, really.

57:10.982 --> 57:12.108
I didn't hear you
complain when you got me

57:12.149 --> 57:13.817
mixed up in this goddamn mess.

57:15.611 --> 57:16.946
I'm not the one
that came to you

57:16.987 --> 57:19.781
beggin' for an easy
way to make some cash.

57:19.824 --> 57:21.326
You just wanna remember that.

57:24.829 --> 57:26.539
At least when we were locked up,

57:26.581 --> 57:28.165
you still had some fight in you.

57:29.918 --> 57:32.128
One bitch on the outside
lets you squeeze her tits,

57:32.170 --> 57:34.798
and suddenly, you go
softer than my granddad

57:34.840 --> 57:37.467
when he forgets to take
his little blue pill.

57:37.508 --> 57:40.595
Listen, I am trying to make
a better life for myself.

57:40.637 --> 57:42.139
You wanna begrudge
me that, fine.

57:42.179 --> 57:43.681
You leave Celia out of it.

57:43.724 --> 57:45.476
"A better life."

57:45.517 --> 57:47.394
Is that what you call it?

57:47.437 --> 57:49.897
She's at home right
now, watchin' talk shows

57:49.939 --> 57:52.107
in between shifts at the
truck stop glory hole

57:52.149 --> 57:54.067
while you're out here
with another woman

57:54.109 --> 57:55.486
rubbin' your feet for ya.

57:56.863 --> 57:59.781
But far be it for me to
intrude on your marital bliss.

58:02.743 --> 58:03.827
How about it?

58:12.170 --> 58:14.505
That bitch back there
was right, you know.

58:14.548 --> 58:16.050
You really are a coward.

58:56.424 --> 58:57.260
Wayland?

59:42.222 --> 59:43.432
Don't kill me.

59:43.472 --> 59:46.435
Don't kill me, I have a
little girl back home.

59:46.476 --> 59:47.603
Oh yeah?

59:47.645 --> 59:48.563
You tie her up and
leave her for dead too?

59:48.605 --> 59:49.731
I'm sorry!

59:49.772 --> 59:51.273
I didn't have a choice.

59:51.315 --> 59:52.107
Shut up!

59:52.150 --> 59:53.067
We're going for a walk.

01:00:07.456 --> 01:00:09.793
What your planning,
it's not gonna work.

01:00:09.834 --> 01:00:11.378
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

01:00:11.419 --> 01:00:12.378
Keep moving.

01:00:12.421 --> 01:00:13.297
Listen to me, listen to me.

01:00:13.338 --> 01:00:14.297
We can just go.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.798
You and me.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.635
I didn't want to get your
pack, it was all him.

01:00:18.677 --> 01:00:21.764
I just wanna get
back to my family.

01:00:21.805 --> 01:00:23.765
I say you shut up.

01:00:25.684 --> 01:00:27.686
You're gonna get
us both killed.

01:00:36.987 --> 01:00:37.821
Drop it.

01:00:37.864 --> 01:00:38.698
Do it now.

01:00:43.828 --> 01:00:45.996
For fuck's sake, Wayland.

01:00:46.038 --> 01:00:46.872
Help.

01:01:02.974 --> 01:01:04.141
God damn, sweetheart.

01:01:05.726 --> 01:01:07.186
Maybe I shoulda left
that piece of thing

01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:09.438
tied up back there and
partnered up with you instead.

01:01:09.479 --> 01:01:10.689
Step away.

01:01:10.731 --> 01:01:11.566
Over there.

01:01:20.616 --> 01:01:23.870
Oh, hell, darlin'.

01:01:23.911 --> 01:01:26.038
You came all the way
up here just for that?

01:01:30.835 --> 01:01:34.297
Thing is, I ain't
leavin' these woods.

01:01:35.214 --> 01:01:36.882
Not for a while yet.

01:01:36.924 --> 01:01:38.384
But I'm still gonna
need the goods you got

01:01:38.426 --> 01:01:40.136
tucked away in there,
far more than I need

01:01:40.178 --> 01:01:41.596
both of his eyes intact.

01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:47.811
So, you do what you gotta do.

01:01:47.853 --> 01:01:49.105
I won't blame you for it.

01:01:53.275 --> 01:01:54.109
No!

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:57.697
All right, all right, all right.

01:02:00.449 --> 01:02:02.576
Let's just all take
a deep breath here.

01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:04.037
Back up!

01:02:04.077 --> 01:02:04.912
Fair trade.

01:02:06.079 --> 01:02:07.748
I get back what
you stole from me

01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:11.252
and you get back whatever
the fuck is in this bag.

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:12.546
That's all I want.

01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:14.798
Now.

01:02:16.258 --> 01:02:17.801
What's it gonna be?

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:23.890
You ain't doing shit.

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:26.602
So you can just stop
with this nonsense,

01:02:26.644 --> 01:02:29.772
put down the bag, and then
we can talk a little bit.

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:31.356
Hey, what the hell do
you think you're doing,

01:02:31.397 --> 01:02:32.567
that's private.

01:02:32.608 --> 01:02:34.443
Hey, hey!

01:02:34.485 --> 01:02:35.319
All right.

01:02:37.905 --> 01:02:42.284
You just put that on the
ground right fuckin' now!

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:43.994
No, what are you doing?

01:02:44.036 --> 01:02:45.955
What the fuck are you doing!

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:48.958
What the fuck did you just do!

01:02:51.418 --> 01:02:52.420
Get the pack!

01:02:52.462 --> 01:02:53.295
Fuck!

01:02:54.505 --> 01:02:55.339
Fuck!

01:03:07.687 --> 01:03:08.521
No!

01:03:09.354 --> 01:03:10.146
Stop!

01:03:46.769 --> 01:03:48.521
Don't you move, you cunt.

01:03:48.562 --> 01:03:49.646
You stay right there.

01:03:50.856 --> 01:03:52.065
I'm gonna come down
there and I'm gonna

01:03:52.108 --> 01:03:54.526
rip your goddamn eyes
out of their sockets.

01:03:54.568 --> 01:03:55.485
Don't you fuckin' move!

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.739
I will fucking end you!

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:01.158
You fucking bitch!

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.201
Hey, Wayland.

01:04:02.242 --> 01:04:03.785
Come on, it's done.

01:04:03.827 --> 01:04:05.329
The hell it is!

01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:07.999
Not until I squeeze the life
out of that meddlesome bitch!

01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:09.208
What good is
it gonna do you, man?

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:10.793
Get your fuckin'
hands off of me!

01:04:10.835 --> 01:04:11.920
Hey, listen to me!

01:04:11.962 --> 01:04:13.547
I need you to focus, man!

01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:16.299
I can't deal with this, I
need you to stay focused!

01:04:16.342 --> 01:04:17.176
Okay!

01:04:19.886 --> 01:04:20.720
Okay.

01:04:23.306 --> 01:04:24.098
I'm focused.

01:04:24.141 --> 01:04:25.392
All right.

01:04:25.433 --> 01:04:27.435
Now what the fuck
we gonna do, huh?

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.897
Parker is out for blood, man.

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:33.776
And we just lost our leverage.

01:04:33.818 --> 01:04:35.070
We're fucked, man.

01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:36.528
Just settle down,
it'll be all right.

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:38.572
What are you talkin'
about, it'll be all right?

01:04:38.615 --> 01:04:40.700
We lost our bargaining chip.

01:04:40.742 --> 01:04:42.118
What are we supposed
to say, huh?

01:04:42.159 --> 01:04:43.577
"Hey Parker, we screwed
up the exchange.

01:04:43.619 --> 01:04:46.247
"Hey, sorry that
everything went to shit.

01:04:46.289 --> 01:04:49.292
"Oh, but don't worry,
we lost your stash too?"

01:04:50.293 --> 01:04:52.253
We're fucked, man.

01:04:52.294 --> 01:04:53.296
The both of us.

01:04:54.965 --> 01:04:56.676
All right, we need
to get out of here.

01:04:56.716 --> 01:04:57.718
Hitch a ride.

01:04:58.969 --> 01:04:59.761
What are
you talking about?

01:04:59.803 --> 01:05:01.305
I can barely walk!

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:03.723
Okay.

01:05:05.016 --> 01:05:07.477
So we'll go back to
the shelter, okay?

01:05:08.853 --> 01:05:11.022
We'll hole down for the night.

01:05:13.317 --> 01:05:14.986
And then we'll eat
something, okay?

01:05:15.027 --> 01:05:16.153
Fine, fine, fine.

01:05:16.194 --> 01:05:18.530
Just quit your snivelin'.

01:05:18.573 --> 01:05:20.242
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:05:20.284 --> 01:05:22.494
Just grab that and let's go.

01:05:31.086 --> 01:05:32.671
I hope it hurts, you bitch.

01:05:34.505 --> 01:05:36.757
I hope it rots off your
body and the coyotes

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.343
tear you to pieces!

01:05:39.595 --> 01:05:40.679
You hear me?!

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:47.477
Hear me?!

01:06:46.747 --> 01:06:51.752
Melanie.

01:06:55.381 --> 01:06:59.594
Melanie.

01:06:59.636 --> 01:07:00.929
Look at me now.

01:07:06.768 --> 01:07:07.895
How does it feel?

01:07:09.771 --> 01:07:10.605
It hurts.

01:07:11.815 --> 01:07:13.692
No, I mean
how does it feel to know

01:07:13.733 --> 01:07:16.820
that after all those
miles and all that time,

01:07:16.862 --> 01:07:18.239
you just can't run anymore?

01:07:22.619 --> 01:07:24.787
What are you
doing here, Chloe?

01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:25.955
You tell me.

01:07:31.961 --> 01:07:32.838
I need help.

01:07:34.298 --> 01:07:36.550
10 years running
every marathon possible,

01:07:36.591 --> 01:07:37.718
and all of a sudden you tell me

01:07:37.758 --> 01:07:39.552
you want to run
through the mountains.

01:07:39.595 --> 01:07:40.721
Why here?

01:07:40.762 --> 01:07:41.930
Why now?

01:07:41.972 --> 01:07:43.974
I've been trying
to puzzle it out.

01:07:44.015 --> 01:07:46.268
And before you start
babbling about distance

01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:48.270
and needing a new
challenge, you should assume

01:07:48.313 --> 01:07:50.273
I already know the
answer to that question.

01:07:50.315 --> 01:07:51.816
But I wanna hear you say it.

01:07:51.857 --> 01:07:53.442
No more bullshit, Mel.

01:07:53.484 --> 01:07:54.527
Just the truth.

01:08:00.616 --> 01:08:01.825
Dad came out here once.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.543
It was before Mom, when
he first got the Army.

01:08:11.169 --> 01:08:13.630
Said he had spend so much
time being told where to be,

01:08:13.671 --> 01:08:16.466
what to do, that he
just wanted to be

01:08:16.506 --> 01:08:17.675
on his own for a while.

01:08:21.011 --> 01:08:25.225
It was the only time
he felt truly free.

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:31.104
He never
told me about that.

01:08:32.691 --> 01:08:33.859
Not surprising, though.

01:08:34.734 --> 01:08:35.653
He was always closer to you.

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:37.322
What are you talkin' about?

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:38.573
He treated me like shit.

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:40.033
You were his little
princess, not me.

01:08:40.075 --> 01:08:42.077
That's bullshit,
Mel, and you know it.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.078
You think he dragged
you out to the track

01:08:44.118 --> 01:08:47.246
six times a week because
he loved you less?

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:49.750
Hours and hours
spent training you.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.544
Giving up his Saturdays at home

01:08:51.585 --> 01:08:52.502
so he could make sure you were

01:08:52.544 --> 01:08:55.171
the best you could possibly be.

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:57.175
He put all his hopes
and dreams into you.

01:08:57.218 --> 01:08:59.135
For Christ's sake,
Melanie, he gave you

01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:00.095
a shot at the Olympics.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.554
Gave it to me?

01:09:01.596 --> 01:09:03.224
You don't think I worked for it?

01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:05.267
And for what?

01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:08.310
You just threw it all away.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.439
Right when he finally
thought all the work

01:09:11.482 --> 01:09:12.984
he put into you would pay off.

01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:15.068
What was it again?

01:09:16.111 --> 01:09:17.028
Steroids?

01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:19.447
EPO.

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:21.785
How could you do that to him?

01:09:21.827 --> 01:09:23.870
How could he do that to me?

01:09:23.911 --> 01:09:26.538
Do you think I wanted to spend
all those Saturdays out there

01:09:26.581 --> 01:09:28.875
runnin' against that
stupid fuckin' stopwatch?

01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:31.544
And watching him shake his
head in disappointment?

01:09:31.586 --> 01:09:34.546
I never wanted to be in the
goddamn Olympics, Chloe.

01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:36.466
That was his dream, not mine.

01:09:37.425 --> 01:09:39.176
What about what I wanted?

01:09:39.219 --> 01:09:41.388
What about my hopes, my dreams?

01:09:41.429 --> 01:09:43.598
Did he ever stop to ask?

01:09:44.725 --> 01:09:46.018
Let me tell you something.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.939
The look on his face when I
had told him what I had done.

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:55.612
That was the single
greatest moment of my life.

01:09:59.157 --> 01:10:01.074
And I never forgave
myself for it.

01:10:05.371 --> 01:10:07.707
Now you're here.

01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:09.542
Broken.

01:10:11.794 --> 01:10:13.254
Well I hate to break
it to you, kiddo,

01:10:13.297 --> 01:10:15.591
but you're gonna have to
run a little bit farther.

01:10:15.632 --> 01:10:18.301
It's not gonna feel good, and
it's not gonna get any better,

01:10:18.343 --> 01:10:21.137
but at least one way or
another, it'll all be over soon.

01:10:23.806 --> 01:10:25.600
Are you gonna tell
people you hurt your knee

01:10:25.642 --> 01:10:27.352
because you fell down once?

01:10:27.394 --> 01:10:29.312
Or are you gonna tell them
that you fell down once,

01:10:29.355 --> 01:10:32.233
but in spite of the pain,
you picked yourself up

01:10:32.275 --> 01:10:34.694
off the ground, you pushed
on and you persevered?

01:10:38.322 --> 01:10:39.950
Now get up.

01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:41.283
Clock's still running.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.234
Come on.

01:13:54.276 --> 01:13:55.736
Come on.

01:13:55.778 --> 01:13:56.613
Come on.

01:13:57.739 --> 01:13:58.698
Come on.

01:13:58.739 --> 01:13:59.573
Come on.

01:16:40.282 --> 01:16:41.116
Hello?

01:16:43.495 --> 01:16:44.328
I'm here.

01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:46.665
Hello!

01:16:49.084 --> 01:16:50.835
Can somebody hear me?

01:16:55.215 --> 01:16:56.508
Hey, down here!

01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:06.519
What are you smiling about?

01:19:08.854 --> 01:19:10.564
You happy with this time?

01:19:10.605 --> 01:19:13.149
That's almost a full
two seconds faster

01:19:13.191 --> 01:19:15.151
than anyone on this
team can pull off.

01:19:15.194 --> 01:19:18.196
And a full three-tenths
of a second slower

01:19:18.239 --> 01:19:19.866
than you ran it just last week.

01:19:22.744 --> 01:19:24.036
You think that's progress?

01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:29.209
Who are you running against?

01:19:31.712 --> 01:19:33.004
You think you're trying
to beat out some runner

01:19:33.045 --> 01:19:34.798
from some other school
or from your own team,

01:19:34.839 --> 01:19:35.716
you're mistaken.

01:19:37.508 --> 01:19:40.511
You think these other
runners care about your time?

01:19:40.553 --> 01:19:42.221
They don't give
a shit about you.

01:19:43.974 --> 01:19:47.437
All they're focused on
is their own performance.

01:19:48.353 --> 01:19:50.606
They're not even looking at you.

01:19:50.647 --> 01:19:52.816
They're looking deep
down inside themselves

01:19:52.858 --> 01:19:54.443
for whatever sliver of willpower

01:19:54.485 --> 01:19:56.446
will take them past their limit.

01:19:59.698 --> 01:20:03.369
When you are out
there, your only enemy

01:20:03.411 --> 01:20:06.497
is yourself and the clock.

01:20:07.916 --> 01:20:09.043
You need to stop thinking
about everything else

01:20:09.083 --> 01:20:11.754
and focus on this, because this

01:20:11.795 --> 01:20:13.839
is the only thing that matters.

01:20:19.094 --> 01:20:19.970
Run it again.

01:21:35.339 --> 01:21:36.757
I'm here!

01:21:36.799 --> 01:21:38.092
I'm here!

01:21:38.134 --> 01:21:39.302
Stop!

01:21:39.343 --> 01:21:40.511
Please!

01:21:40.553 --> 01:21:44.057
Please please stop, stop
please, please stop!

01:21:44.099 --> 01:21:45.434
Please stop.

01:21:45.475 --> 01:21:46.560
Please.

01:21:49.313 --> 01:21:51.481
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

01:21:53.026 --> 01:21:55.193
You all right, sweetheart?

01:22:02.492 --> 01:22:03.827
So two men did this to you?

01:22:07.791 --> 01:22:09.460
That's just truly awful.

01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:13.087
I'm so sorry that
happened to you.

01:22:15.215 --> 01:22:16.425
I'll get the staties
out here right away

01:22:16.466 --> 01:22:17.925
to start lookin' for 'em, but,

01:22:19.177 --> 01:22:20.762
it's an awful lot
of woods to cover.

01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:23.765
Any guess as to where
we should start?

01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:32.024
About 30 miles in, I
landed at a hiking shelter

01:22:32.066 --> 01:22:33.859
up on a bluff, near
the ridge line.

01:22:35.904 --> 01:22:37.364
That's where they were headed.

01:22:37.404 --> 01:22:38.657
Yeah, I know the place.

01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.992
Hey, we'll find 'em.

01:22:41.909 --> 01:22:42.743
Don't you worry.

01:22:44.745 --> 01:22:45.955
All right now.

01:22:45.997 --> 01:22:48.374
First things first, that
knee has got me worried.

01:22:48.416 --> 01:22:50.918
Maybe not a bone break,
but I'll call ahead

01:22:50.961 --> 01:22:53.879
and have an ambo standing by
at headquarters just in case.

01:22:55.799 --> 01:22:58.259
I'll only be right over
there to call it in, hon.

01:22:59.344 --> 01:23:00.346
Not gonna leave you.

01:23:45.475 --> 01:23:49.647
They're waiting for us,
you think you can make it?

01:23:59.907 --> 01:24:01.117
This was theirs.

01:24:01.158 --> 01:24:04.453
Someone just tried to
call it, if it helps.

01:24:04.495 --> 01:24:06.205
Yeah, I'm sure
it will at that.

01:24:07.373 --> 01:24:10.961
All right, now you just
get settled in there.

01:24:11.002 --> 01:24:11.961
Yep.

01:24:12.003 --> 01:24:13.296
All right, mind the leg.

01:24:13.338 --> 01:24:14.172
Okay.

01:24:16.716 --> 01:24:18.134
Get you fixed up in no time.

01:25:27.916 --> 01:25:29.710
Where's the
headquarters building?

01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:34.506
Did you try calling anybody
with that phone you had?

01:25:34.548 --> 01:25:35.756
The police, or?

01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:38.843
I couldn't get a signal.

01:25:40.178 --> 01:25:42.264
Well, that's all right, then.

01:25:44.434 --> 01:25:45.268
So.

01:25:48.938 --> 01:25:50.105
Where's that backpack?

01:25:57.488 --> 01:25:59.866
What is this?

01:25:59.907 --> 01:26:01.659
I'm sorry about this, honey.

01:26:01.701 --> 01:26:03.286
I really am.

01:26:03.327 --> 01:26:05.912
But I need you to
answer me, now.

01:26:07.874 --> 01:26:10.836
The blue backpack you
got that phone from.

01:26:11.712 --> 01:26:13.254
I wanna know where it is.

01:26:14.422 --> 01:26:15.381
They still have it?

01:26:17.051 --> 01:26:17.968
I wouldn't know.

01:26:19.802 --> 01:26:21.930
We make regular
checks on that shelter

01:26:21.971 --> 01:26:24.015
throughout the hiking season.

01:26:24.057 --> 01:26:25.391
It's about a mile in there.

01:26:26.769 --> 01:26:28.896
They'll never know we're comin'.

01:26:28.936 --> 01:26:30.480
That we're coming?

01:26:30.521 --> 01:26:31.357
Well.

01:26:32.484 --> 01:26:33.985
I can't exactly leave you here.

01:26:34.026 --> 01:26:35.779
I mean, cell phones
aren't for shit,

01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:37.697
but that radio gets
perfect reception.

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:42.619
But you'll survive.

01:26:44.663 --> 01:26:46.915
I'm not the bad guy
here, sweetheart.

01:26:46.955 --> 01:26:48.499
But we all gotta play our part.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.353
I believe I met
a friend of yours.

01:28:32.942 --> 01:28:35.570
Now if what my supplier
tells me is true,

01:28:35.611 --> 01:28:37.614
you already have one
bullet hole in you.

01:28:38.697 --> 01:28:39.907
Don't make this hard.

01:28:47.290 --> 01:28:48.124
Good boy.

01:28:49.209 --> 01:28:50.043
Have a seat.

01:28:51.753 --> 01:28:52.586
Both of you.

01:29:11.064 --> 01:29:11.898
Now then.

01:29:13.108 --> 01:29:15.443
I think it's time we
all had a little talk.

01:29:25.454 --> 01:29:27.498
Now I already heard the
report from the state police,

01:29:27.541 --> 01:29:30.293
but now, I wanna
hear your version.

01:29:34.506 --> 01:29:37.259
Parker, this is not our fault.

01:29:37.301 --> 01:29:38.885
They started shooting at us.

01:29:38.926 --> 01:29:40.052
Are you gonna tell me that was

01:29:40.095 --> 01:29:42.973
before one of them
took four knife wounds?

01:29:43.016 --> 01:29:45.226
You know the only
reason I'm not in jail

01:29:45.267 --> 01:29:47.352
and there aren't
dogs chasin' you down

01:29:47.395 --> 01:29:49.856
like game through these
woods is because that man

01:29:49.896 --> 01:29:51.982
kept his mouth shut,
despite the dozens

01:29:52.025 --> 01:29:53.776
of stitches he received.

01:29:53.818 --> 01:29:54.944
And why's that?

01:29:54.985 --> 01:29:57.654
Because he is a
goddamn professional.

01:29:57.696 --> 01:29:59.865
Which is more than I can
say for the two of you.

01:30:05.038 --> 01:30:07.081
But that's all in
the past, right?

01:30:07.124 --> 01:30:08.625
Hmm?

01:30:08.666 --> 01:30:12.170
You gave them the money, they
gave you what you paid for.

01:30:12.212 --> 01:30:14.423
As far as I'm concerned,
the deal is done.

01:30:15.923 --> 01:30:17.426
So.

01:30:17.468 --> 01:30:19.595
Let's put all this
nastiness behind us,

01:30:19.637 --> 01:30:22.264
you give me my product,
I let you go on your way.

01:30:23.557 --> 01:30:24.391
Fair's fair.

01:30:29.103 --> 01:30:33.317
You do still have what
I paid for, I hope.

01:30:35.862 --> 01:30:36.780
Oh sugar.

01:30:37.906 --> 01:30:39.573
Please tell me
you still have it.

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.454
We did everything we
were supposed to do.

01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:49.209
We did the exchange, and
then everything went to hell,

01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:51.294
so we just ran, we
didn't know where else...

01:30:51.335 --> 01:30:53.420
All right, one last chance
before I lose my temper.

01:30:53.463 --> 01:30:57.801
Where are my drugs?

01:30:57.842 --> 01:30:59.053
I know where they are.

01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:03.557
I snatched the backpack
from the skinny one.

01:31:03.599 --> 01:31:05.351
Took the phone, stashed the bag,

01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:07.560
right before they
threw me off the cliff.

01:31:07.603 --> 01:31:09.188
You're a goddamn liar.

01:31:12.399 --> 01:31:14.567
You know what, sweetheart?

01:31:14.609 --> 01:31:18.656
After all this, I never
did get your name.

01:31:19.865 --> 01:31:20.700
It's Mel.

01:31:22.452 --> 01:31:24.162
Well, Mel.

01:31:25.454 --> 01:31:27.416
You got me in quite
the pickle here.

01:31:28.833 --> 01:31:31.336
On one hand, you've got no
reason to lie to me, do you?

01:31:32.671 --> 01:31:35.465
Then again, I got no
reason to trust you either.

01:31:37.426 --> 01:31:39.218
But we got common
ground, you and I.

01:31:40.721 --> 01:31:43.391
We both want what's
rightfully ours.

01:31:45.435 --> 01:31:46.852
So let's help each other out.

01:31:48.061 --> 01:31:50.647
Us girls gotta stick
together, after all.

01:31:50.690 --> 01:31:51.524
Am I right?

01:31:54.026 --> 01:31:55.527
I'll tell him where it's at.

01:31:57.530 --> 01:32:01.075
Me and him go to the car,
I tell him the location,

01:32:01.116 --> 01:32:02.784
and I drive away.

01:32:02.826 --> 01:32:03.660
That's the deal.

01:32:06.622 --> 01:32:09.250
How do I know you're
telling the truth?

01:32:09.293 --> 01:32:10.126
Like you said.

01:32:11.253 --> 01:32:12.713
I got no reason to lie to you.

01:32:14.130 --> 01:32:15.965
But I'd feel much
better with that gun

01:32:16.008 --> 01:32:18.552
trained on him instead of me.

01:32:35.987 --> 01:32:37.154
All right, loves.

01:32:37.197 --> 01:32:38.782
You heard the lady.

01:32:38.822 --> 01:32:41.785
Jared, looks like
you're going for a walk.

01:32:41.826 --> 01:32:43.203
You fuckin' blind?

01:32:43.243 --> 01:32:45.496
I want you to understand
something, Wayland.

01:32:45.537 --> 01:32:47.874
I saw how that girl looked
when she came out of the woods,

01:32:47.916 --> 01:32:49.709
and you're going
to answer for that.

01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:51.544
I promise you.

01:32:52.754 --> 01:32:55.007
But until that time
comes, you just might

01:32:55.048 --> 01:32:56.759
wanna shut your mouth.

01:33:14.734 --> 01:33:17.904
Look, I don't want any
more problems here, okay?

01:33:17.947 --> 01:33:20.241
We've all been through
hell these past...

01:33:42.263 --> 01:33:44.224
Fair's fair, partner.

01:33:44.267 --> 01:33:45.268
I think you'll agree.

01:34:25.142 --> 01:34:30.147
Woo!

01:34:44.244 --> 01:34:46.622
Your little girlfriend's
flown the coop, Jared.

01:34:47.873 --> 01:34:49.083
Don't worry, buddy.

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:51.920
I'm gonna take real
good care of her.

01:34:53.671 --> 01:34:55.173
I'm sure that your
cock-shrivelin' wife

01:34:55.216 --> 01:34:57.301
will be glad to know that
I'm lookin' out for you

01:34:57.342 --> 01:34:58.426
through all this.

01:35:00.011 --> 01:35:03.474
Shoot you.

01:35:13.191 --> 01:35:14.025
Who knows?

01:35:15.819 --> 01:35:18.823
Maybe I'll take real
good care of her too

01:35:18.865 --> 01:35:20.951
when this is all said and done.

01:35:24.663 --> 01:35:25.664
Please.

01:35:25.705 --> 01:35:26.623
Wait, wait.

01:36:42.618 --> 01:36:44.036
Come on, darlin'.

01:36:45.162 --> 01:36:46.413
I made you something.

01:36:55.216 --> 01:36:57.176
You like playing
games, don't you?

01:36:58.968 --> 01:36:59.803
Of course you do.

01:37:01.722 --> 01:37:02.932
It's all right, darlin'.

01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:07.520
It's just fine, 'cause I
got a real doozy for you.

01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:12.857
Olly olly oxen-free.

01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:14.527
Come on out and
claim your prize.

01:37:30.084 --> 01:37:31.837
That was mighty unkind of you.

01:37:38.343 --> 01:37:40.679
And after all that
I've done for you.

01:37:49.522 --> 01:37:50.398
Hell, darlin'.

01:37:53.859 --> 01:37:54.693
You oughta be thankin' me.

01:38:10.793 --> 01:38:13.255
All that fight in you.

01:38:13.296 --> 01:38:14.672
All that piss and vinegar.

01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:19.219
That's there because I
brought it out of you.

01:38:21.055 --> 01:38:21.847
I made you.

01:39:33.671 --> 01:39:35.756
I'll be dreaming
of you, sweetheart.

01:40:46.289 --> 01:40:48.958
Probably take rescue crews
a couple hours to get here,

01:40:48.999 --> 01:40:50.377
I had to guess.

01:40:52.462 --> 01:40:54.423
Probably longer
once it gets dark.

01:40:56.883 --> 01:40:59.719
You'll have a hell of a time
explaining all this to them.

01:41:01.179 --> 01:41:02.972
But at least you'll live to see

01:41:03.014 --> 01:41:04.474
your wife and daughter again.

01:41:07.602 --> 01:41:11.565
Either that, or you can lay
here and bleed to death.

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:14.735
It's up to you.

01:43:23.745 --> 01:43:25.247
I know that I'm hard on you.

01:43:27.165 --> 01:43:29.084
And I know you probably
hate me for it.

01:43:32.254 --> 01:43:34.840
But it's important that
you understand one thing.

01:43:37.050 --> 01:43:41.471
No matter how hard I push you,
or how many times you fail.

01:43:50.439 --> 01:43:51.732
I'm proud of you, baby.
