WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:02.377
Previously on
"The Watchful Eye"...

00:02.377 --> 00:04.004
You must be--
Roman.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.047
The new doorman.

00:05.047 --> 00:06.131
I'm just doing my job.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.883
Yeah, the job I got you.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.718
I need you to write
a letter to the parole board.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.011
Say you miss your mother.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.471
You got a lot of nerve.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.640
Just remember, even though
they treat you like

00:14.640 --> 00:17.059
you're part of the family,
you can't trust them.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.685
So, the Wards' old nanny, Morgan...

00:18.685 --> 00:20.187
Super nice.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.939
...one day,
she disappears.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.482
We heard
that Allie fired her.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.234
Maybe Matthew was angry
that she fired

00:25.234 --> 00:27.152
the nanny
he was in love with.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.071
Morgan signed this NDA.
For what?

00:29.071 --> 00:30.614
It isn't my story to tell.

00:30.614 --> 00:31.990
Otis Winthrop the Third

00:31.990 --> 00:34.701
is the CEO
of the Greybourne Corporation.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.120
"I want to take this precious
jewel and run

00:37.120 --> 00:38.664
but it will always be yours."

00:38.664 --> 00:40.332
Precious jewel.

00:40.332 --> 00:43.502
Maybe wherever Winthrop lived,
that's where the jewel is.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.629
Mr. Winthrop's only nice
when his grandkids are around.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.047
Apparently his daughter lives
in his old apartment

00:47.047 --> 00:48.882
now with her family,
the Chans.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.467
Ginny works
for the Chans.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.177
That's gotta be
where it is.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.228
Hello?

01:01.228 --> 01:03.522
Yo.
It's me.

01:03.522 --> 01:04.815
Teo, are you okay?

01:04.815 --> 01:06.191
I had a heart attack
when I saw the number.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.026
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.529
I thought you weren't allowed
to make calls during the week.

01:10.529 --> 01:11.947
I'm not.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.574
I had to get
special permission.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.368
This place is
so extra with the rules.

01:16.368 --> 01:19.079
You wouldn't last
a day here.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.539
Funny.
You got jokes.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.207
Just saying.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.543
Only one of us has a rap sheet,
and it's not me.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.920
Hey, I was trying to put food
on the table.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.090
Hey, shut up.
I'm not calling to lecture you.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.633
I'm calling 'cause Ronnie
asked me to write a letter

01:31.633 --> 01:34.094
to the parole board
on her behalf.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.096
She says I should write that
she's, like, a good mom

01:36.096 --> 01:37.306
and I miss her
and whatever.

01:37.306 --> 01:39.683
Yeah, you're not
doing that.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.101
Why?

01:41.101 --> 01:43.562
If she gets paroled,
I can get out of this shit hole.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.230
Okay, first of all,
it's not a shit hole.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.690
It's a really good school.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.191
And Scott had to pull
a lot of strings

01:48.191 --> 01:50.152
to get you into that school
and to get you a scholarship.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.695
Tell me again how this
is the best education

01:51.695 --> 01:53.071
I can hope to get.

01:53.071 --> 01:56.241
Look, I know you don't care,
but I care.

01:56.241 --> 01:59.119
I hate it here, Elena.
It sucks.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.329
I want to go home.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.913
What home?

02:01.913 --> 02:04.541
There is no home, okay?
There's nothing left.

02:04.541 --> 02:08.211
Look, I just need you to hang on
a little longer, okay,

02:08.211 --> 02:10.881
until I get my feet
underneath me.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.299
I have something
in the works.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.800
Something big.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.053
We're not gonna have to worry
about money anymore.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.431
What,
you don't believe me?

02:19.431 --> 02:21.266
You sound like her.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.726
Always some scheme.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.022
Damn, dude.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.191
That's unfair.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.360
You wanna talk unfair?

02:34.279 --> 02:35.530
To what do I owe
the pleasure

02:35.530 --> 02:38.116
of this unexpected visit?

02:38.116 --> 02:39.660
I think you know.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.037
Mm.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.664
Somehow, I don't think
you're here to check up

02:43.664 --> 02:46.083
on my well-being
or bring me a muffin basket.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.834
I'm here to tell you
face to face,

02:47.834 --> 02:50.629
you need to stop
calling Teo.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.131
You can't keep me away
from my son.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.466
I don't have to.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.343
The state of New York
is doing it for me.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.513
Thanks to you,
my little traitor.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.808
You still blaming me
for that?

03:02.808 --> 03:05.227
It wasn't my choice
to commit a felony.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.646
It was your choice
to go along with it,

03:07.646 --> 03:09.773
and your choice to cry
those big, sad tears

03:09.773 --> 03:12.275
to the judge about
how you were just a minor,

03:12.275 --> 03:14.444
a little toddler
with pigtails,

03:14.444 --> 03:19.199
and not 17 years old
and heartless,

03:19.199 --> 03:21.785
and you lie like a rock
and you don't feel anything.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.579
That's fine.
That's what it is.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.290
I don't feel anything.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.585
Like an old
burned-up building.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.212
Sound familiar?

03:32.212 --> 03:34.923
What happened in your dad's
garage was an accident.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.301
He kept that place in perfect
condition, and you know it.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.262
There was no negligence
that caused that fire.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.763
Those developers wanted
the poor people

03:41.763 --> 03:43.515
and their little business
out of the way,

03:43.515 --> 03:44.766
so they blew it up.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.810
I told your father
to sell that garage

03:46.810 --> 03:49.020
to the Greybourne Corporation
when he had the chance,

03:49.020 --> 03:51.148
and he didn't listen to me.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.859
So whatever happened
after that was not my fault.

03:53.859 --> 03:57.904
You watched him suffer,
and you did nothing.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.781
You're gonna stop giving Teo
false hope

03:59.781 --> 04:01.158
that you're getting out.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.577
But I am getting out.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.328
That's what happens
when you've served your time.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.496
You haven't
served your time.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.165
You got eight years.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.541
It's been seven months.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.959
Prison overcrowding.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.669
You're not gonna get out
on parole

04:12.669 --> 04:14.337
if someone tells
the parole board

04:14.337 --> 04:17.007
that you're a danger to society
and a poison pill to your family

04:17.007 --> 04:18.383
and that you deserve
to be here

04:18.383 --> 04:21.052
every last second
of your sentence!

04:21.052 --> 04:23.472
Hey. Keep your voice down, please.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.144
Look, you don't want to write
a letter supporting my parole,

04:29.144 --> 04:32.105
I can't force you.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.609
Luckily, I got one kid
who loves me.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.986
Sorry you wasted
a trip up here.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.327
Introduce yourself around.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.162
I'm sure you'll be seeing
these people again

04:47.162 --> 04:50.415
when you get caught
and you get thrown into jail.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.068
Morgan?

05:19.903 --> 05:22.739
Hey, it's--
Can you turn off
your phone?

05:22.739 --> 05:23.865
It's better safe
than sorry.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.492
They can track
with them.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.701
Okay.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.037
I got you a coffee.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.247
Thanks.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.168
Do you want
to sit down?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.670
Yeah.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.883
Sorry.
It's just...

05:41.883 --> 05:44.427
they're always watching.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.596
Who?
Who's they?

05:46.596 --> 05:48.640
How's Jasper?

05:48.640 --> 05:52.727
Um, he's good, actually.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.437
He's been through a lot, obviously,

05:54.437 --> 05:57.315
but he's starting
to come through it.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.318
Poor little guy.
He's--

06:00.318 --> 06:03.446
He's been through a lot.
I really miss him.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.781
I could tell him
you said hi--

06:04.781 --> 06:07.659
No. I-I can't have
contact with him.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.077
I signed an NDA.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.831
Yeah.
James mentioned it.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.750
Guessing things
didn't end well, huh?

06:15.750 --> 06:18.920
Understatement of the year.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.380
They got me a new job
and they found me

06:20.380 --> 06:22.716
an apartment
at The Hildebrand.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.801
I guess
I came out ahead.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.178
Sort of.

06:27.178 --> 06:31.266
Look, I don't want to put you
in an uncompromising situation,

06:31.266 --> 06:34.477
but I just need to know if I'm
safe working for this family.

06:37.772 --> 06:41.318
Something happen
with Matthew?

06:43.153 --> 06:44.487
No.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.406
God, no.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.033
Wait, is that
what people are saying?

06:50.535 --> 06:51.911
Well, they're wrong.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.038
I would never.

06:53.038 --> 06:53.955
And Matthew
would never either.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.790
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.791
He wasn't the problem.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.834
Was it Allie?

06:57.834 --> 07:00.003
Did you two not get along?

07:00.003 --> 07:03.214
I loved Allie.
She was wonderful to me.

07:03.214 --> 07:06.843
She treated me
like one of the family.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.928
But she wasn't well.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.680
How so?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.183
She started
seeing things,

07:13.183 --> 07:16.811
people that weren't
really there.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.605
Did you see them, too?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.774
No.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.609
But whenever she left
the Greybourne,

07:22.609 --> 07:23.943
people were watching her.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.904
The same people
that were watching you?

07:25.904 --> 07:28.907
All I know is that
she was unraveling,

07:28.907 --> 07:31.201
and her family--
they didn't believe her.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.911
They just wanted the problem
to be gone.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.162
And it was.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.664
Because that's
what they do.

07:35.664 --> 07:36.998
The Wards?

07:36.998 --> 07:40.085
The Greybournes.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.212
They have this hatchet-faced
lawyer on retainer,

07:42.212 --> 07:46.216
and he just--
he takes out the trash.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.550
Who's the lawyer?

07:47.550 --> 07:49.010
What's his name?

07:52.722 --> 07:55.016
They're here.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.103
Probably watching you, too.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.437
I have to go.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.815
What? No.
Wait. Wait.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.899
No. What--

08:02.899 --> 08:05.110
Please don't
contact me again.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.946
It's not safe
for either of us.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.506
Hey.
What took you so long?

08:26.506 --> 08:27.716
What do you want me
to do?

08:27.716 --> 08:29.426
I was working.
I came here as fast as I could.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.177
I think somebody
might be watching me.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.596
Who?
I don't know.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.682
I went to go see the Wards'
old nanny this morning,

08:35.682 --> 08:38.101
and she told me that she's
being watched all the time.

08:38.101 --> 08:41.521
Okay, so someone's
watching her.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.106
You think this is a joke?
No, no.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.400
I'm-- I'm not laughing,
but what do you want me to do?

08:45.400 --> 08:46.693
You want me to hire
a personal security guard

08:46.693 --> 08:47.861
because you feel like
you're being watched?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.320
I want you to care.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.114
Okay, of course I care,
but I think you might be

08:51.114 --> 08:52.532
getting yourself
a little worked up here.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.284
Then I'm doing this
on purpose?
I don't know.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.703
Maybe, because you want
to find a way out.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.039
You know, you can be a real
asshole, you know that?

08:59.039 --> 09:00.707
Hey.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.960
Listen, I know you're stressed,
and I get that,

09:03.960 --> 09:05.128
but you need to keep
your head on straight

09:05.128 --> 09:06.629
till we're done
with this.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.259
Why didn't you give me
a call back last night?

09:11.259 --> 09:13.303
I left you like five--
Phone was off.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.846
Okay, well, I really wanted
to talk to you.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.936
I wanted to say I was sorry
for how I behaved,

09:21.936 --> 09:24.522
how I acted,
and what I said.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.940
I messed up, okay?

09:25.940 --> 09:28.985
I'm sorry about that.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.111
Okay, this is where
it's customary to say,

09:30.111 --> 09:31.488
"I'm sorry, too, Scott."

09:31.488 --> 09:32.989
So you're a relationship
expert now?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.407
Okay, you know what?
You're in a real mood,

09:34.407 --> 09:35.450
and I got enough on my plate,
so--

09:35.450 --> 09:37.160
Then go. Okay.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.329
Bury your head in the sand.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.546
But you could take
a little break.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.549
Well, I could, but...

09:51.549 --> 09:52.801
I'll see you.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.762
What's his deal?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.555
Who? Roman?
Yeah.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.015
Like, does he have
a girlfriend, or...

09:59.974 --> 10:01.184
Uh, how would I know?

10:01.184 --> 10:02.644
Well, when we were
hanging out,

10:02.644 --> 10:03.937
I figured maybe
he said something.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.313
We weren't hanging out.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.606
We were cleaning up
your mess.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.817
I know.
So ask him.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.652
I just--
ugh, forget it.

10:10.652 --> 10:13.530
Were you ever planning
on telling me about this?

10:13.530 --> 10:15.406
I've told you over and over
to ask me

10:15.406 --> 10:17.534
before borrowing
my things.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.285
Why do you assume
I did it?

10:19.285 --> 10:20.787
I know you did.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.497
And now the clasp
is broken

10:22.497 --> 10:25.083
because you show no respect
for other people's belongings.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.960
It's just a bag.
It's my bag.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.753
Your bag.
Your apartment.

10:28.753 --> 10:29.921
Your life.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.756
I'm just the interloper.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.842
Promise you'll never let me
forget that.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.679
You all right?

10:39.222 --> 10:42.725
I'm fine.
Bag is not.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.727
She was kinda rude
back there.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.063
If I ever spoke to one
of my parents like that...

10:47.063 --> 10:48.690
Well, I'm not a parent.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.775
I'm the wicked stepmother.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.278
Every fairy tale
needs a villain.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.737
I can take that
to repair shop for you

10:54.737 --> 10:56.406
if you like,
Mrs. Ayres.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.199
Oh. You don't need
to do that.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.701
It's not big deal.

10:59.701 --> 11:00.952
I already have to take a pair
of shoes to Arturo's

11:00.952 --> 11:02.453
to get re-soled
for Mr. Chan.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.789
I was just
on my way there now.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.792
Oh.
Roman, you're a dear.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.252
Thank you.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.985
Chilaquiles.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.156
So I went to go meet up

11:38.156 --> 11:41.034
with the Wards' old nanny today, Morgan.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.076
And?

11:42.076 --> 11:43.661
She said
she's being watched.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.246
By who?

11:45.246 --> 11:46.748
She couldn't be specific.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.374
She said the Greybourne
family lawyer,

11:48.374 --> 11:51.127
this guy named Marcato,
made her sign an NDA.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.879
Damn.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.297
That's pretty messed up.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.715
You think it's true?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.675
I think it might be
in her head.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.428
All the more reason we need
to find this ruby, get our cash,

12:00.428 --> 12:02.972
and get out
before my mom gets paroled.

12:06.017 --> 12:09.354
So, in this letter,
Jocelyn tells Alistair

12:09.354 --> 12:12.190
that she suspects that
Winthrop stole her treasure.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.901
So if he actually stole it
and hid it in his apartment,

12:14.901 --> 12:17.111
it still might be there.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.322
He says, "he swears he will
never let it go,

12:19.322 --> 12:21.449
he will sleep with one eye
open to guard it."

12:21.449 --> 12:24.160
So I'm thinking bedroom.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.995
I think
I can get in there.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.332
I can set up a playdate
with Jasper and Rex.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.750
Are they even friends?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.544
Well, they will be.

12:33.544 --> 12:38.716
But, Elena, if Morgan's
really scared as all that,

12:38.716 --> 12:42.345
this family's as dangerous
as they seem,

12:42.345 --> 12:44.973
I think there oughta
be some hazard pay.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.850
You'll get your cut.

12:47.850 --> 12:51.020
Or we could just split your cut
even-steven, no?

12:51.020 --> 12:53.398
I'm already splitting it
with Scott.

12:53.398 --> 12:54.774
I mean, I set
this whole thing up.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.569
I'm sorry, but 50/50
isn't gonna cut it.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.780
I mean, we don't even know
how much it's worth.

13:06.244 --> 13:09.122
Does he know
you brought me in?

13:09.122 --> 13:12.667
Or that I even exist?

13:12.667 --> 13:14.210
He doesn't need to know everything.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.508
Ah, the 21st century playdate.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.219
I try not to lobotomize them
with video games too often,

13:23.219 --> 13:25.596
but sometimes
we both just need a break.

13:25.596 --> 13:26.973
Well, I'm sure the game
that they're playing

13:26.973 --> 13:29.600
is highly educational.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.353
This is place is
really nice.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.355
Oh. Yeah.
All the Greybournes live

13:34.355 --> 13:37.191
in three-dimensional issues
of "Architectural Digest,"

13:37.191 --> 13:38.985
but if I've learned
one thing working here,

13:38.985 --> 13:41.195
it's that money
does not buy happiness.

13:41.195 --> 13:44.073
The Winthrop-Chans

13:44.073 --> 13:46.868
are miserable.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.037
All the Greybournes?

13:49.037 --> 13:50.204
The Greybournes
and the Winthrops

13:50.204 --> 13:51.873
are all the same family.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.082
What?

13:53.082 --> 13:55.168
Rich people
love to intermarry.

13:55.168 --> 13:59.088
I think Alistair Greybourne's
wife was a Winthrop.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.257
Now they're everywhere,
like carpenter ants.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.429
Where's the bathroom?

14:06.429 --> 14:08.181
Uh, front hall,
to the left.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.065
What are you doing
in here?

14:59.065 --> 15:01.234
I ended up using
the bathroom in here,

15:01.234 --> 15:03.236
and then I got nosy.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.821
Half the reason
I took this job

15:04.821 --> 15:06.989
is to snoop around
in fancy apartments.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.075
I really wish you hadn't.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.201
Mrs. Winthrop-Chan

15:10.201 --> 15:11.744
has a freakish
photographic memory.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.538
She knows if anything
is out of place in here,

15:13.538 --> 15:15.665
or even
the least bit askew.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.251
I was just curious
about her beach reads,

15:18.251 --> 15:20.795
and they're really sad.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.880
Just don't do it again, okay?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.882
Sure. Yeah.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.385
Won't happen.

15:27.385 --> 15:30.429
It's weird. This apartment is
like the mirror image

15:30.429 --> 15:32.140
of the Wards' apartment.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.058
Yeah, they're all similar.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.519
This one has two more rooms
than yours, though.

15:36.519 --> 15:37.854
The Winthrop-Chans moved in

15:37.854 --> 15:40.106
when they needed room
for the second baby.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.316
but Mrs. Winthrop-Chan
grew up in your apartment--

15:42.316 --> 15:44.318
Matthew and Allie's
apartment.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.486
She did?

15:45.486 --> 15:47.613
Mm-hmm.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.198
We should get back.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.127
Hey, Roman.
Jasper's off fencing.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.253
Have fun, Zorro.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.796
Who's Zorro?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.298
You don't know
who Zorro is?

16:05.298 --> 16:07.925
"Avenge the helpless,
punish the cruel politicians,

16:07.925 --> 16:09.051
aid the oppressed"?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.553
Nada?

16:12.763 --> 16:14.515
So?

16:14.515 --> 16:16.809
Ginny said that the Winthrops
used to live in the apartment

16:16.809 --> 16:18.936
that Matthew
lives in now.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.229
So?

16:20.229 --> 16:22.064
So, if Winthrop
used to live there,

16:22.064 --> 16:23.566
maybe that's
where it's stashed,

16:23.566 --> 16:26.444
and it's been under my nose
the whole time.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.905
Elena, come on!
We're gonna be late!

16:28.905 --> 16:30.406
Coming.
Allez!

16:35.411 --> 16:38.331
Hello?
Anybody home?

16:49.967 --> 16:51.344
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.847
I wanted to drop off
Jasper's inhaler refill.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.265
Great.
Thank you.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.017
You packing up?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.561
Oh, I-I have to pack up all of
Allie's clothes for tomorrow.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.146
We're, uh,
gonna auction them off

17:02.146 --> 17:05.900
at a charity benefit
for the children's hospital.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.693
You're making progress.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.990
You know, I have known
about this for weeks.

17:12.990 --> 17:17.536
Every time I walk in,
I walk right back out again.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.913
I don't know.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.039
I don't think
I can do this.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.624
I could help.

17:21.624 --> 17:24.043
No. I couldn't ask that.
That's too much.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.170
No, seriously,
I'm good at this stuff.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.880
I want to help.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.008
Why don't you take Jasper out
for a movie and some ice cream,

17:31.008 --> 17:33.970
and I'll handle this?

17:33.970 --> 17:36.514
Might be a good idea
for him not to...

17:36.514 --> 17:38.307
see this, you know?

17:38.307 --> 17:40.309
Thank you.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.145
No, that's--
that's really smart.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.523
Okay.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.692
Now, look, Tory and Allie's
friends have already

17:47.692 --> 17:49.694
been through the closet,
so, um, you know,

17:49.694 --> 17:51.779
if you see anything you like,
feel free to keep it.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.531
Oh, that's really generous,
but I--

17:53.531 --> 17:54.657
No, I insist.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.911
She had good stuff.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.874
She sure did.

18:07.295 --> 18:10.172
Hey.
Thanks for coming.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.341
What exactly
am I doing here?

18:12.341 --> 18:15.261
I wanted to say I'm sorry
for letting my curiosity

18:15.261 --> 18:17.555
get the better of me earlier.

18:17.555 --> 18:20.641
I did not want to jeopardize you
or your job.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.476
I wasn't thinking.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.437
Thanks.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.647
Is that all?

18:26.647 --> 18:30.192
Well, I'm getting some
overtime cash for cleaning out

18:30.192 --> 18:33.362
Allie's closet,
and I was thinking,

18:33.362 --> 18:34.947
maybe you want
to help me out?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.324
We could split the cash.

18:36.324 --> 18:39.702
Matthew said we could
take whatever we want.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.747
And to sweeten the deal...

18:43.914 --> 18:45.583
You had me

19:20.242 --> 19:23.371
My dad had a St. Christopher
pendant just like this one.

19:28.459 --> 19:32.004
He died, and I packed up
all of his stuff, too.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.676
My mom couldn't do it,
and my brother was just a kid,

19:36.676 --> 19:39.053
so I did it.
I'm sorry.

19:39.053 --> 19:41.263
I-I had no idea
you lost your dad.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.307
It's okay.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.601
I don't really like
talking about it, you know?

19:49.563 --> 19:54.402
You don't really like talking
about much of anything.

19:54.402 --> 19:58.072
You're like a book
that's still in the shrink wrap.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.574
Not a judgement.
Just an observation.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.245
No, you're right.

20:04.245 --> 20:05.746
I don't.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.544
I don't really like
to open up.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.045
I get that.

20:15.464 --> 20:19.093
My one thing is that
I don't like being lied to.

20:19.093 --> 20:22.304
And I'll never lie to you.

20:22.304 --> 20:25.850
Just let me keep the shrink wrap
on a little longer.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.351
Deal.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.441
Uh...

20:33.441 --> 20:35.443
What's that?

20:35.443 --> 20:36.610
An envelope.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.778
Let's see.

20:37.778 --> 20:38.696
Ooh, uh...

20:38.696 --> 20:40.656
It was open.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.616
Probably
just some papers.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.869
W-We should probably just
give this to Matthew.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.247
Oh.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.207
What?

20:50.207 --> 20:51.959
It's divorce papers.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.628
They were splitting up?

20:58.090 --> 20:59.717
And Matthew was
the petitioner?

21:06.223 --> 21:08.517
But he didn't sign it.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.977
What?

21:09.977 --> 21:11.479
It doesn't matter.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.442
I'm gonna go get
some more boxes.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.574
Hey.
Come here.

21:23.574 --> 21:24.700
Try this on.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.743
What?

21:25.743 --> 21:28.245
This is you.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.331
No, I couldn't.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.082
Humor me.

21:32.082 --> 21:35.836
♪ My dear, I'll always find
a way to drown ♪

21:35.836 --> 21:38.047
That is all you, girl.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.799

21:39.799 --> 21:43.427
♪ Out here, I'm searching

21:43.427 --> 21:47.014
Oh, yeah, you are
keeping this dress.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.557
A gown?

21:48.557 --> 21:50.476
What am I gonna wear
a gown to?

21:50.476 --> 21:52.728
You can wear a gown anywhere
you want to wear a gown.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.608
But this is
Allie's dress.

21:57.608 --> 22:00.319
It's a little weird, right?

22:00.319 --> 22:03.948
Eh, it's only weird
if you make it weird.

22:03.948 --> 22:10.663

22:14.291 --> 22:15.751
What do you think

22:20.798 --> 22:24.552
Matthew asked us to pack up
some of Allie's stuff.

22:24.552 --> 22:27.137
They're gonna come by tomorrow
and pick them up for charity.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.931
I haven't sealed the boxes,
if you want to take something.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.727
No.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.021
Allie and I had
different taste.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.775
Hmm.

22:39.775 --> 22:44.196
Everyone always described her
as "effortless."

22:44.196 --> 22:47.533
Whereas I have never been
described as effortless,

22:47.533 --> 22:48.951
even once in my life.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.790
Please take that off.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.422
How did she know
that we were in here?

23:09.722 --> 23:11.932
Okay,
I'm gonna head out.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.851
Thank you so much.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.185
Of course.
I'll call you.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.729
Bye.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.239
We're home!

23:27.239 --> 23:29.825
Hey.
Hey there.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.453
Wow.

23:32.453 --> 23:33.787
It seems to be
going well.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.248
Yeah, only have
a couple boxes left.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.291
How was the movie?

23:37.291 --> 23:39.168
Unbearably stupid.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.587
I took a nap.

23:41.587 --> 23:45.007
Daddy, can I have
some screen time?

23:45.007 --> 23:48.010
You just had two hours
of screen time at the movie.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.054
Ugh, okay, fine.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.222
Oh, this kid.

23:52.222 --> 23:55.351
Uh, look, I'm gonna make some
dinner, if you want to stay.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.019
Might be nice to dine
with someone who eats something

23:57.019 --> 23:59.188
other than dino nuggets. Oh.

23:59.188 --> 24:02.316
I actually only eat
dino nuggets.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.276
It's a rare
medical condition.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.404
Oh, well, I mean,
in that case...

24:07.404 --> 24:08.572
You don't have to stay
if you have plans.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.740
I just thought...

24:09.740 --> 24:12.493
No, I--
Dinner sounds great.

24:12.493 --> 24:13.494
Thank you.

24:13.494 --> 24:14.912
Great.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.923
I can't talk right now.

24:25.923 --> 24:27.091
Aren't you off today?

24:27.091 --> 24:28.926
Yeah, I'm just
out with friends.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.511
I thought
maybe you'd come home.

24:30.511 --> 24:33.097
I'm sorry, but I'm
not in the mood to be yelled at.

24:33.097 --> 24:35.349
Ronnie already
yelled at me today.

24:35.349 --> 24:36.892
I'm not gonna
yell at you, okay?

24:36.892 --> 24:38.894
I-I just want to talk.
I'm gonna make things right.

24:38.894 --> 24:39.895
I shouldn't have
blown up at you.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.063
Okay?
That-- That was me.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.272
That was my own shit.

24:42.272 --> 24:43.649
Will you please
just come over?

24:43.649 --> 24:44.942
I just-- I just want
to see you and talk.

24:44.942 --> 24:46.735
I said I can't.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.697
Red or white?

24:49.697 --> 24:51.615
I gotta go.

24:51.615 --> 24:54.493
Hey.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.750
Hey.
Went with red.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.585
Hope that's okay.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.838
Uh, yeah.
That's perfect.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.297
Salud.
Salud.

25:09.967 --> 25:11.468
Mmm.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.512
Prepare to enter
the inner circle,

25:13.512 --> 25:17.558
because I'm gonna show you
something very, very important.

25:17.558 --> 25:18.976
My mother's
gnocchi recipe.

25:18.976 --> 25:21.353
Mmm. Never met a gnocchi
I didn't love.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.312
Want to chop up
the herbs?

25:22.312 --> 25:24.148
Sure.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.654
Ooh. Ooh.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.197
You okay?

25:32.197 --> 25:34.324
Yep.
No blood, no problem.

25:34.324 --> 25:37.161
Okay, look, here--
proper method.

25:37.161 --> 25:38.954
Fingers on top,

25:38.954 --> 25:42.041
rocking back
away from the body.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.375
Not too fast.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.044
No, watch your fingers.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.256
You know, I'll be honest,

25:49.256 --> 25:52.301
I didn't have you pegged
as a master chef.

25:52.301 --> 25:55.888
I worked as a line cook
in the summer during college,

25:55.888 --> 25:57.347
couple classes
in grad school,

25:57.347 --> 26:00.309
so, I don't know.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.853
Find it relaxing.

26:02.853 --> 26:06.356
And I'm pretty sure

26:06.356 --> 26:10.569
that this is
how you do this.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.825
So, what is your favorite
design project?

26:16.825 --> 26:18.827
Um...

26:18.827 --> 26:21.455
I really like the one
I'm doing now, actually.

26:21.455 --> 26:24.917
It's a community center geared
toward reducing food deserts.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.585
That way, local residents
don't have to travel too far

26:26.585 --> 26:29.171
if they want
to find quality food.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.255
Actually breaking ground
on Monday,

26:30.255 --> 26:31.840
if you want to come.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.634
Bring Jasper.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.719
He would love that.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.554
Hey.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.850
Why is the closet empty?

26:43.060 --> 26:44.603
Oh, buddy,
you know what?

26:44.603 --> 26:48.941
Um, you know how all those
pretty clothes were in there?

26:48.941 --> 26:51.735
Someone should probably
be wearing them, right?

26:51.735 --> 26:53.028
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna give them

26:53.028 --> 26:54.613
to people who need them.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.032
But I don't want
to give them away.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.284
Hey, you know what?

26:59.284 --> 27:02.955
I actually found something
pretty cool.

27:02.955 --> 27:06.750
Look at this.

27:06.750 --> 27:10.838
It's a bracelet that your mom
made especially for you.

27:10.838 --> 27:13.132
See?
"J" is for you,

27:13.132 --> 27:14.675
the "A" is for
your mommy,

27:14.675 --> 27:17.052
and the "M"
is for your dad.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.514
So, now when you wear it,

27:20.514 --> 27:22.474
it's like she'll always
be with you,

27:22.474 --> 27:23.725
wherever you go.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.769
Thank you.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.396
Aww.

27:30.232 --> 27:31.567
Go on.
Go brush your teeth.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.193
I'll be in
in a few minutes.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.987
Okay.
Goodnight.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.405
'Night.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.282
That's twice you came
to the rescue today.

27:40.075 --> 27:41.577
You should probably
ask for a raise.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.583
Is something burning?

27:47.583 --> 27:50.043
Oh, no.
I thought I turned it off.

27:51.378 --> 27:55.090
Oh, what a waste. Oh.

27:55.090 --> 27:58.552
Oh.
Wait, your smoke detector
didn't go off.

27:58.552 --> 28:00.178
Uh, must be
out of batteries.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.180
Um, oh, geez.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.599
Look, I'll grab some.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.278
Well, no luck
with the batteries.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.655
Oh, that's okay.

28:59.655 --> 29:03.075
I can pick some up
before I come in on Monday.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.911
I'm gonna head out.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.497
Oh, okay.
You know what?

29:08.497 --> 29:09.790
Why don't you take
Monday morning off?

29:09.790 --> 29:12.209
You put in so much
overtime today.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.503
I can take Jasper to art class
and then head to work,

29:14.503 --> 29:16.588
and you can pick him up afterwards,

29:16.588 --> 29:18.048
bring him
to the groundbreaking.

29:18.048 --> 29:19.758
Sure. Yeah.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.551
Uh, thanks again
for dinner.

29:21.551 --> 29:24.429
I'll see you then.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.014
Thanks for staying.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.113
Hey.
We need to talk.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.823
What's wrong?

29:42.823 --> 29:44.992
Not here.
Come with me.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.709
What?

29:53.709 --> 29:55.335
- Face the wall.
- What the hell? Why?

29:55.335 --> 29:56.795
The security camera.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.171
Turn, please.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.882
I don't want them
to read our lips.

30:00.882 --> 30:04.386
I found surveillance cameras
in Matthew's apartment.

30:04.386 --> 30:05.679
That's messed up.

30:05.679 --> 30:06.638
It's just like
Morgan said.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.140
They're always watching.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.058
I didn't want to believe it
till I saw myself,

30:10.058 --> 30:11.435
but I don't think
Matthew put them there.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.978
So who did?

30:12.978 --> 30:15.272
Shit.
I don't know.

30:15.272 --> 30:17.107
Wait, weren't you off,
like, hours ago?

30:17.107 --> 30:19.526
Were you still up there
till just now?

30:19.526 --> 30:20.610
We had dinner.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.112
You had dinner
with your boss?

30:22.112 --> 30:23.697
He invited me.
He cooked.

30:23.697 --> 30:26.491
And you love
playing with fire.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.910
Yeah, and I've seen you flirting
with Bennet, and I have eyes.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.121
Hey, I don't work
for Bennet, okay?

30:31.121 --> 30:32.789
And at least we're roughly
the same age.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.124
Whereas Matthew--

30:34.124 --> 30:35.834
well, we could psychoanalyze
that all day.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.253
Okay, I'm not here
to argue with you, okay?

30:38.253 --> 30:39.755
Let's just please get out
of the lobby.

30:39.755 --> 30:42.257
Okay, where?

30:42.257 --> 30:44.676
Somewhere I haven't
showed you before.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.563
Wow.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.898
Yeah, dude,
this is creepy.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.734
That's being generous.
These people will put

31:00.734 --> 31:03.945
surveillance cameras
in their smoke detectors--

31:03.945 --> 31:06.406
who knows how far
they'll go?

31:06.406 --> 31:08.116
And why don't you think
Matthew put in the cameras?

31:09.284 --> 31:11.620
He didn't seem
to know about them.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.455
And Morgan said
he wasn't the problem.

31:13.455 --> 31:14.581
I don't think it was him.

31:22.756 --> 31:24.841
I think they're Tory's.

31:24.841 --> 31:28.512
She knew that me and Ginny
were in Allie's closet,

31:28.512 --> 31:32.557
so maybe she was
spying on Allie.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.559
Or Matthew was
spying on Allie.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.269
Why do you keep
going back to him?

31:36.269 --> 31:38.522
Why do you keep
excusing him?

31:38.522 --> 31:41.066
Because he's not
a Greybourne.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.317
Look.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.361
I found this
in Allie's closet.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.907
He filed for legal separation
before she died.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.659
So he wanted out?

31:50.659 --> 31:53.662
Miss Ivey said he got a ton
of money when Allie died.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.039
So why file
divorce proceedings

31:56.039 --> 31:57.457
if you would have
to forfeit the payout

31:57.457 --> 31:58.667
from your wife's death?

31:58.667 --> 32:00.919
Unless you're trying
to indemnify yourself,

32:00.919 --> 32:02.754
make it seem like you didn't
kill your wife for the money.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.715
What's this?

32:05.715 --> 32:07.592
"Victory Marcato,
attorney-at-law".

32:11.221 --> 32:14.933
This is the lawyer
that made Morgan sign the NDA.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.601
I'm gonna call her.

32:21.982 --> 32:25.193
The number you have reached
is not in service.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.195
That's... not great.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.659
You think it says
Hildebrand on the building?

32:32.659 --> 32:34.786
Uh... it's this one.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.330
I think this is it.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.999
Or it was.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.214
The notice is dated today, Rome.

32:52.179 --> 32:53.763
What did they do to her?

33:01.146 --> 33:02.480
Scott?

33:05.692 --> 33:07.027
Scott?
Hey.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.653
She's gone.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.740
Morgan, the Wards' old nanny--
she's gone.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.117
What? What-- What time--
Who's gone?

33:14.117 --> 33:15.452
Morgan.

33:15.452 --> 33:16.786
And now her phone's
been disconnected,

33:16.786 --> 33:18.580
the building that she lives in
has been condemned.

33:18.580 --> 33:19.831
It's like
she just vanished.

33:19.831 --> 33:20.999
Okay, just--
just hold on, hold on.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.251
Just slow down.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.253
She didn't answer her phone.
Maybe her voicemail is full.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.588
No, her voicemail
isn't full.

33:26.588 --> 33:29.257
It got disconnected,
no longer in service.

33:29.257 --> 33:32.219
What if whoever's watching her
saw that we met up

33:32.219 --> 33:33.803
and they got to her?

33:33.803 --> 33:36.014
Okay, or maybe no one's watching
and she's just paranoid.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.682
I found surveillance cameras
in the apartment today.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.267
She wasn't
being paranoid.

33:39.267 --> 33:42.103
Okay.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.231
I want you to file
a missing-persons report.

33:44.231 --> 33:45.690
Dude, you can't file
a missing-persons report

33:45.690 --> 33:47.692
after a few hours.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.653
Look, maybe--
maybe she lost her phone

33:49.653 --> 33:51.488
and she disconnected it
on purpose, or maybe...

33:51.488 --> 33:52.864
No.
...maybe the building
was already

33:52.864 --> 33:54.407
set for demolition
and she moved.

33:54.407 --> 33:57.369
No. I think she knows something
about Allie's death.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.870
Okay, look, if this involves
Allie's death,

33:58.870 --> 34:00.205
don't get involved.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.790
Don't go poking around
where you don't need to.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.417
And what about Morgan?

34:04.417 --> 34:06.253
Okay, I can set up an alert
in our system

34:06.253 --> 34:07.879
to see if anything comes up
for her name,

34:07.879 --> 34:09.297
but without concrete evidence
that something happened to her,

34:09.297 --> 34:11.466
that's all I can do.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.968
If I do that,
will you drop this?

34:12.968 --> 34:14.636
Drop this?

34:14.636 --> 34:16.429
Someone who got too close
to the Greybournes

34:16.429 --> 34:18.682
might be in danger, which means
I might be in danger.

34:18.682 --> 34:21.518
Are you getting too close
to the Greybournes?

34:21.518 --> 34:23.395
You end up having red or white
with dinner last night?

34:26.064 --> 34:28.149
What?

34:28.149 --> 34:29.651
What, are you gonna go
back there tonight?

34:29.651 --> 34:32.320
Yeah.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.571
I feel safer there.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.834
Hey. What's up?
We came as soon as you texted.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.127
Hey.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.211
Alex normally loves
Sunday morning drinks,

34:48.211 --> 34:49.754
but someone's
in a mood.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.381
James blew me off.

34:51.381 --> 34:53.508
We were supposed to meet up
last night, but he ghosted.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.719
He said he was working.
Maybe he got held up.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.679
Where?
In an outer borough somewhere

34:57.679 --> 34:59.514
with no texting
capabilities?

34:59.514 --> 35:01.391
We in witness protection?

35:03.560 --> 35:06.479
I just found out
that the Greybournes

35:06.479 --> 35:08.440
spy on their employees.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.567
I found cameras all over
Matthew's apartment.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.444
Okay.
We're gonna need beers

35:12.444 --> 35:14.237
if we're gonna have
the nanny-cam talk.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.197
It's a hazard
of the trade.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.616
We all deal with it.

35:17.616 --> 35:21.620
No. This wasn't just like
a camcorder in a teddy bear.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.872
This was like
government surveillance.

35:23.872 --> 35:26.041
Maybe they just sprung
for the fancy stuff.

35:26.041 --> 35:27.292
I mean,
they got big money.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.418
When I got the job,

35:28.418 --> 35:30.253
I met this nanny that said
that even though

35:30.253 --> 35:32.464
they treat you like family,
you can't trust them.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.632
Wise words.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.133
No, I get that.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.010
I'd be flipped out, too.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.386
Anything we can do
to help?

35:38.386 --> 35:39.596
There you guys are.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.931
Alex, I'm so sorry
about last night.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.975
No, God.
I-I-I don't care.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.894
Totally fine.
No. No, no, it's--
it's not.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.395
I'm really,
really sorry.

35:47.395 --> 35:49.731
I-I was in the recording studio
till late,

35:49.731 --> 35:51.441
and then
the Wi-Fi was spotty.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.151
I just lost track of time.
That-- That's on me.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.487
Maybe next time,
find a landline or something

35:55.487 --> 35:58.365
so everyone doesn't think
you're dead.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.784
Sure. Yeah.
Of course.

36:00.784 --> 36:03.912
But, uh, maybe we can reschedule,

36:03.912 --> 36:05.997
I don't know, tonight?

36:05.997 --> 36:08.124
Uh, yeah, maybe.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.794
I'll check my cal
and text you.

36:10.794 --> 36:12.462
Want a morning beer?

36:12.462 --> 36:14.839
Absolutely.
Yeah. Please.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.342
So, uh, what'd I miss?

36:17.342 --> 36:19.302
Elena found high-tech
surveillance equipment

36:19.302 --> 36:21.012
in the Wards' apartment.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.430
- No kidding.
- Yep.

36:22.430 --> 36:26.184
- Where?
- In the smoke detectors.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.561
Maybe Mr. Ward's
in the CIA, huh?

36:28.561 --> 36:31.731
Yeah, it's not funny.

36:31.731 --> 36:32.941
Right.
No, of course.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.401
Yeah. Sorry.
Read the room, James.

36:34.401 --> 36:37.112
Geez. Thanks.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.321
Uh, but what are you
gonna do?

36:38.321 --> 36:40.490
You know, it's the reality
of the gig.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.325
Wish we could spy on them.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.751
Here you go. Thanks.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.211
So what's the plan?

37:00.844 --> 37:02.303
Hey.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.222
Roman was gonna bring it up,
but I was on my way.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.266
He had Arturo rush it.

37:06.266 --> 37:08.852
Uh, Arturo never
rushes anything.

37:10.687 --> 37:12.313
Thank you.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.815
Sure.

37:15.525 --> 37:18.695
I wanted to say I'm sorry
for snapping at you

37:18.695 --> 37:20.238
in the closet
the other day.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.199
It was...

37:23.199 --> 37:24.909
just a sad reminder.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.870
I get it, you know?

37:26.870 --> 37:29.122
They're things,
but they're more than that.

37:29.122 --> 37:30.790
Thank you.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.070
Miracles do happen.
You called me back.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.573
You screwed her over,
didn't you?

38:03.573 --> 38:05.074
Excuse me?

38:05.074 --> 38:06.701
You were actively campaigning
against her parole,

38:06.701 --> 38:08.161
and now her hearing
is postponed.

38:08.161 --> 38:09.788
What?

38:09.788 --> 38:12.749
Actively campaigning?

38:12.749 --> 38:13.958
What's wrong with you,
Elena?

38:13.958 --> 38:15.752
She's our mom.

38:15.752 --> 38:17.962
Okay, this is totally inappropriate.

38:17.962 --> 38:19.839
She should have never called you
and involved you.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.841
I specifically said
not to.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.551
Why?

38:23.551 --> 38:25.678
I'm the man of the house now
and you treat me like a baby.

38:25.678 --> 38:29.808
Teo, every choice I make,
every decision

38:29.808 --> 38:32.018
is because
I care about you.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.895
I'm trying
to take care of you.

38:33.895 --> 38:35.730
That is all
I'm trying to do.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.357
How are you taking care of me
by locking me up

38:37.357 --> 38:38.858
in this hell hole?

38:38.858 --> 38:40.485
You're just taking care
of you.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.862
Come on, man.

38:42.862 --> 38:45.615
You know I love you.

38:45.615 --> 38:48.701
I hope one day
you'll understand that.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.245
I don't think
I'll ever understand.

38:52.914 --> 38:53.998
Teo.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.625
I gotta go.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.669
Time limits.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.594
Do you see your dad?

39:06.594 --> 39:10.390
Not really.
There's Dad.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.600
Oh, hey, buddy.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.352
Thanks for coming to help me
at work today.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.020
Can I hold the shovel?

39:16.020 --> 39:19.274
Oh, you read my mind, because
it is way too heavy for me.

39:19.274 --> 39:20.608
Thanks for bringing him.
You're welcome.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.402
He should be proud.

39:22.402 --> 39:23.862
Come on.
Meet me up here.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.950
Hello.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.285
I want to thank everyone
for coming here today.

39:30.285 --> 39:33.580
My name is
Otis Winthrop the Third.

39:33.580 --> 39:36.958
I am the CEO of
the rinky-dink organization

39:36.958 --> 39:40.295
we call
the Greybourne Corporation.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.797
We are so proud to partner

39:42.797 --> 39:44.549
with the Greybourne Preservation Fund,

39:44.549 --> 39:47.594
represented here today
by myself and my father,

39:47.594 --> 39:49.721
Otis Winthrop the Second.

39:49.721 --> 39:53.308
And now I can formally announce
that our very own Matthew Ward

39:53.308 --> 39:56.185
is coming in-house as his firm,
Ward & Brickman,

39:56.185 --> 40:00.189
become an official
Greybourne subsidiary.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.692
Please, give a warm welcome
to my good friend,

40:02.692 --> 40:05.778
my trusted colleague,
and my... cousin-in-law?

40:05.778 --> 40:08.114
Is that right?

40:08.114 --> 40:10.241
Matthew Ward, everyone.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.910
Thank you.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.995
Good afternoon.

40:13.995 --> 40:16.247
It's an honor to represent
the Greybournes,

40:16.247 --> 40:20.084
who are committed to bringing
prosperity and opportunity

40:20.084 --> 40:22.211
to every corner
in New York City.

40:22.211 --> 40:23.546
Thank you.

40:25.298 --> 40:26.925
Wah!

40:35.934 --> 40:37.936
Jasper, you did great!

40:37.936 --> 40:41.397
Soon, you're gonna join
the family business.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.608
I, uh, I got a car
waiting for us.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.735
Oh, Jasper said
he wanted to walk.

40:45.735 --> 40:48.279
Oh, um, okay.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.906
I'll, uh-- I'll see you guys
at home, then.

40:49.906 --> 40:51.491
See you, buddy.
Bye, Dad.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.078
Okay.
Let's go.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.751
Dad?

41:07.590 --> 41:09.801
Why is Daddy talking
to Mommy's friend?

41:09.801 --> 41:11.886
Mommy's friend?
