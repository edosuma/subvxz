00:33.400 --> 00:35.300
Brett, what is that?

00:35.400 --> 00:38.500
Brett, wake up.
What is that?

00:39.500 --> 00:40.900
Wait here.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.200
I'll check it out.

00:56.100 --> 00:58.000
Brett! Brett!

00:58.000 --> 00:59.300
Brett, get up!

00:59.300 --> 01:00.300
Brett!

01:00.300 --> 01:02.200
Get up!

01:03.300 --> 01:05.200
Come on.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.700
Help! Help!

01:14.300 --> 01:15.200
Help!

01:15.300 --> 01:16.500
Somebody help us!

01:50.300 --> 01:52.800
Horatio.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.700
Fire Rescue's getting
the fire under control.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.200
We got one male victim.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.900
His name is, uh, Brett Morrison.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.200
Any survivors?

02:01.200 --> 02:02.200
Yeah.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.300
Claire Gibbs.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.600
They fished her out of the pool.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.100
Okay, Frank.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.800
We got a hot spot!
Everybody clear out!

02:13.900 --> 02:15.300
Let's go! Let's go!

02:18.500 --> 02:20.000
Everybody out.
The water heater's going to blow.

02:20.100 --> 02:21.700
Ma'am, come with me, please.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.800
Frank!

02:36.800 --> 02:38.800
Everybody, back up and calm down.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.100
Stay away from the vehicle.

02:41.100 --> 02:44.100
We've got the situation under control.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.900
I just bought that car.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.400
You all right?

02:47.400 --> 02:48.500
Yeah.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.800
First, it's a damn land mine.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.500
Now it's a flying water heater.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.700
What next?

02:52.800 --> 02:54.600
Next, we catch a killer.

03:02.700 --> 03:10.700
---CSI Miami S05E22---
"BURNED"

03:50.400 --> 03:53.100
Ah, so does the water heater
come standard or is that custom?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.500
Just got her a week ago.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.000
How the hell could
something like this happen?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.500
Well, the fire heats the tank,

03:58.600 --> 04:00.300
the pressure builds, and, uh...

04:00.400 --> 04:01.700
You stop up the kettle...

04:01.800 --> 04:03.900
Yeah, the kettle will blow.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.700
I wish I could have seen it.

04:05.800 --> 04:06.800
Yeah.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.300
Thank you.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.200
Ms. Gibbs.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.399
My fianc?

04:18.399 --> 04:19.899
He didn't...

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
he's still in there.

04:22.100 --> 04:24.700
Ms. Gibbs, we're aware of that.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.500
Look, there's no glass out here.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.500
There's no broken
glass on the ground.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.500
It must all be inside,

04:34.600 --> 04:37.000
covered by debris,
which we can't get to.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.900
Someone broke into the house.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Could be the arsonist's point of entry.

04:42.100 --> 04:45.100
Fire Department says we can't
get in there until it's safe.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.400
Hmm.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.300
Well, hopefully, this print
will tell us who it is.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.100
Ms. Gibbs, we believe

05:14.200 --> 05:17.100
that someone may have
deliberately set the fire.

05:17.100 --> 05:18.600
Deliberately?
Mm-hmm.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.000
Now, can you
think of anyone

05:20.000 --> 05:22.800
who might want to hurt
you or your family?

05:24.800 --> 05:26.800
Ms. Gibbs.

05:29.500 --> 05:33.500
I got a restraining order
on someone last year.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.300
You want to tell me
what happened?

05:37.400 --> 05:40.100
An ex-boyfriend
was harassing me.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.500
When I left him,
he became obsessed.

05:42.500 --> 05:47.500
He'd come to my work,
call me, send me e-mails.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.800
I moved.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.900
And he followed.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.700
All the way from Key West.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.300
When Brett and I got engaged,

05:56.300 --> 05:59.000
it, it just sent him
over the edge.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.300
Brett, it's me.

06:03.300 --> 06:04.300
He's here again.

06:04.300 --> 06:05.800
What should I do?

06:11.600 --> 06:14.400
What's his name?

06:16.500 --> 06:18.800
I don't want to say.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.000
Every time I reported him

06:20.100 --> 06:22.100
to the police,
it just made him angrier.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.500
Ms. Gibbs, I need you to trust me.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.700
We don't want him to
do this to anyone else.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.500
So what's his name?

06:31.600 --> 06:35.000
Anthony.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.800
Anthony Bryant.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.000
I'll find him.

06:38.100 --> 06:39.200
Okay?

06:40.700 --> 06:42.800
Attention, suspect vehicle spotted,

06:42.900 --> 06:43.900
corner of Collins and Eighth.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.400
Anthony Bryant, show yourself.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.100
Yelina.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.700
What are you doing here?

07:16.800 --> 07:17.700
Working.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.300
I'm a private investigator now.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.700
I thought Ray Jr. would have told you.

07:21.700 --> 07:22.700
Well, he didn't.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.600
This is Anthony Bryant's car,
Yelina.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.000
How did you know?

07:29.500 --> 07:31.500
Anthony Bryant is a
suspect in a murder

07:31.500 --> 07:32.800
that occurred around dawn.

07:33.300 --> 07:34.900
No, that's impossible.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.700
I was hired to watch him.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.900
I've been following him
for the past 12 hours

07:38.900 --> 07:39.900
and he's done nothing wrong.

07:40.000 --> 07:40.900
Hired by who?

07:41.400 --> 07:42.500
Anthony's lawyer.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.000
Said he may be in some trouble.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.400
I planted a GPS monitor.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.400
I was just removing it.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.800
My services were only required
through this morning.

07:55.000 --> 07:55.900
Of course.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.800
And I was his alibi.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Where is he now?

08:02.400 --> 08:05.100
Anthony, on the day
that someone tries

08:05.100 --> 08:06.400
to kill your ex-girlfriend,

08:06.400 --> 08:09.500
you hire a private investigator
to follow you around.

08:10.000 --> 08:10.900
Why is that?

08:12.800 --> 08:15.800
Let's just say that, uh,
when you get to know someone,

08:16.900 --> 08:18.200
you got to go with your hunches.

08:18.200 --> 08:22.200
In addition, we have burglary,
stalking, and arson.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.800
They're all arrests.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.300
No convictions.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.800
I think that's going to change.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.700
Look, the "burglary"

08:29.800 --> 08:31.800
came a week after
Claire and I broke up,

08:31.800 --> 08:34.000
when I went back to her
place to get my stuff.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I even had a key.

08:36.299 --> 08:37.400
What about the stalking?

08:37.799 --> 08:38.900
She wouldn't
call me back

08:38.900 --> 08:40.700
when I tried to tell her
our dog died.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.400
I mean... look,

08:42.400 --> 08:44.400
this is all Claire making
something out of nothing.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.400
And the arson?

08:45.800 --> 08:47.100
You mean the one last year?

08:47.300 --> 08:49.000
We were actually still together then.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.200
We decided to burn stuff
our exes gave us.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.000
It was some stupid bonding thing.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.500
I guess a neighbor freaked
and called the cops.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.000
You have an excuse
for everything, Anthony.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.500
And an airtight alibi.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.500
Yes, and that's going
to change, too.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.500
Well, I'm assuming
he died from his burns.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.500
No.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.100
Actually, our boy ate fire.

09:13.700 --> 09:14.500
Is that his lung?

09:14.500 --> 09:15.500
What's left of it.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.900
Brett Morrison took a gasp
of superheated air.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.400
Right, 'cause
air can heat up

09:20.400 --> 09:22.100
to almost a thousand degrees
in a matter of minutes

09:22.100 --> 09:24.100
and that would instantly
cook your bronchial tubes.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.100
That's right.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.200
And the heat ruptured
his Alveoli.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.600
He was suffocated.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.300
The fire cooked the rest of him.

09:44.200 --> 09:48.200
Luckily for you, hot air
wasn't the only thing he ate.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.300
Oh, there's something in his teeth?

09:50.400 --> 09:52.400
What is that?
Now, honey,

09:52.600 --> 09:54.800
I can't do
all your work for you.

09:57.800 --> 09:58.600
Thank you.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.500
Hey, Valera, what's my trace
sample doing here in DNA?

10:25.700 --> 10:26.600
It was biological.

10:26.900 --> 10:29.300
He had meat
in his teeth.
Oh.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.900
Chicken, steak?

10:30.900 --> 10:32.200
Human, actually.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.500
Really?

10:33.600 --> 10:35.600
Brett Morrison must have got
in a fight and bit someone.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.200
Sure did, and he didn't
brush afterwards.

10:38.300 --> 10:39.400
I wonder what that was about.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.900
Why don't you ask
Michael Lipton?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Sure doesn't look like
somebody you should be biting.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.500
Oh, definitely not.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.200
Okay, thanks.

10:50.200 --> 10:50.900
Sure.

10:56.000 --> 10:56.800
Frank.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.000
You got a new car yet?

10:58.200 --> 11:00.200
'Cause I've got someone
I would love for you to pick up.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.200
Hey, Frank, I got your message.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.100
What's the emergency?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.900
I got a, uh, suspect

11:18.900 --> 11:20.300
that's giving me
the silent treatment.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.900
Oh, yeah?You need my, uh,
superior interrogation skills

11:22.900 --> 11:23.900
to work him over?

11:24.600 --> 11:25.700
Keep dreaming, bud.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.300
This guy asked for you.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.400
Oh, yeah? What's his name?

11:31.000 --> 11:31.900
Michael Lipton.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.500
Said he's not gonna talk
to anybody but you.

11:40.000 --> 11:40.800
You know him?

11:43.600 --> 11:45.200
Ryan. You know this guy?

11:45.200 --> 11:47.400
No, I've never seen this guy
before in my life.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.900
Our dead man took a bite
out of him recently.

11:50.300 --> 11:51.200
You want me to go in with you?

11:53.100 --> 11:53.700
No, I can handle it.

11:53.700 --> 11:54.400
Thanks, man.

12:08.700 --> 12:09.900
You've got five seconds
to tell me

12:09.900 --> 12:12.700
why you brought my name
into this.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.100
Tell you why, Wolfe.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.500
Your buddy Tex says I'm a prime
suspect in some murder case.

12:17.900 --> 12:18.600
Oh, yeah?

12:19.200 --> 12:20.900
What the hell do you want me
to do about that?

12:21.200 --> 12:22.100
Cut me loose.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.900
I didn't do squat.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.400
Except for get in a fight
with the victim.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.500
I'm sorry, Lipton.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.600
But you sink or swim
around here on the evidence.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.500
You're on your own. Okay?

12:35.600 --> 12:37.600
Hey, I don't need that heat.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.200
You forgetting, Wolfe?

12:39.200 --> 12:40.200
You owe me.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.600
Ten grand.

12:48.700 --> 12:49.400
Let me tell you something.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.800
That has nothing to do with this.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.600
I didn't put those cards
in your hand, kid.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.700
You wanted to play poker
with the big boys.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.700
I don't have that kind of money.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.600
You make this go away,
your debt goes with it.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.600
We're done having
this conversation.

13:21.200 --> 13:21.800
Hey.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.000
How'd it go in there?

13:23.600 --> 13:24.900
You know, I got interrupted.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.600
Something about an old case.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.400
It can't wait?

13:28.300 --> 13:29.700
No, actually, it can't.

13:30.200 --> 13:30.800
Do me a favor.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.300
Will you go in there and take over for me?

13:32.300 --> 13:32.900
Yeah, sure.

13:32.900 --> 13:33.600
I'd be happy to.

13:33.900 --> 13:34.900
Thanks. I appreciate it.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.900
Roll up your sleeves,
Mr. Lipton.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.700
Why? What for?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.500
Because Brett Morrison bit you,
and now he's dead.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
So go ahead. Do it.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.500
We had a little
disagreement.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.100
I hired his company
to throw my sister's wedding.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.000
Put up a hundred grand
for a deposit.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.200
And what happened?

14:04.500 --> 14:05.900
He stiffed me.
That's what happened.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.200
Backed out at the last minute.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.200
Took my money
and broke my sister's heart.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.500
So you confronted him.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.600
Damn right I did.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.300
I paid you that money
in good faith.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.300
Cough it up. My company's going under, okay?

14:17.300 --> 14:19.800
The bank-- they seized our
assets, they froze our accounts.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
There's nothing I can do about it.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.100
Nothing you can do, huh?!

14:23.600 --> 14:24.400
I'll kill you.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.000
So he bit me.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.700
Couldn't fight like a man.

14:30.700 --> 14:31.600
What's that prove?

14:32.200 --> 14:32.900
Proves to me that you had

14:32.900 --> 14:34.500
all the motive in the world
to kill him.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.800
And who are you?

14:38.800 --> 14:40.600
I'm the person who's gonna
take you down for murder.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.700
Tough girl, hiding
behind that badge.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.200
No one talks to me that way.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.400
Oh, really? Sit down.

14:53.300 --> 14:54.400
Now, if I were you,

14:55.200 --> 14:56.100
I'd let her go.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.100
It's okay, Horatio. I've got it.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.600
We were just having
a discussion.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.500
She's trying to lay
a bum rap on me.

15:08.300 --> 15:09.600
If you don't sit down,

15:10.400 --> 15:12.300
what's could be the least of your problems.

15:24.000 --> 15:24.700
Horatio.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.600
Hey.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.300
I have to say,
twice in one day?

15:29.200 --> 15:30.600
That's more than
I've seen you in months.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.100
And I apologize for that.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.900
No, I understand completely.

15:35.300 --> 15:38.600
Let's just say
it's been a rough year for both of us.

15:40.800 --> 15:41.700
Why did you want to see me?

15:43.100 --> 15:45.100
Yelina, Michael Lipton.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.100
Michael Lipton just made bail.

15:53.700 --> 15:54.800
And you don't think he should have.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.400
Not by a long shot.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.100
Could you shadow him for me?

15:58.100 --> 15:58.900
No problem.

15:59.300 --> 16:02.000
I'll see where he hangs out,
who he knows.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.100
Every step he takes.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.100
Hey.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.700
Is that the glass from
outside the crime scene?

16:43.100 --> 16:45.100
Yeah. It's the only piece
of viable evidence

16:45.100 --> 16:46.300
that we've gotten so far.

16:46.300 --> 16:47.400
Yeah, and I am so hoping

16:47.400 --> 16:48.900
it puts Michael Lipton
at the scene.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.300
Guy thinks he's Tony Soprano,

16:50.300 --> 16:52.000
and I just want to put this guy away.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.000
Yeah, I heard about that.You okay?

16:58.300 --> 16:59.300
So, um...

17:00.600 --> 17:01.300
So Calleigh seems to be

17:01.300 --> 17:03.400
taking an interest in you
since you got back.

17:04.099 --> 17:05.400
Yeah, she...

17:05.900 --> 17:08.099
she's been great, really helpful.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.700
Everyone has.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.900
Yeah. Not really
what I meant, though.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.900
What?
I...

17:13.900 --> 17:15.200
Well, never mind, never mind.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.500
What, you think me and Calleigh...?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
I saw her kiss you.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.000
Only on the cheek.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.500
I'm just, you know, saying...

17:29.200 --> 17:30.700
Damn it. That's not my guy.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.100
Print on the glass is Ron Cramer.

17:34.700 --> 17:35.900
Penny-ante rap sheet.

17:36.100 --> 17:38.600
Yeah, well, it looks like he's
playing for higher stakes now.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.700
Ron Cramer?

17:49.700 --> 17:50.600
I'm Calleigh Duquesne.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.300
I'm with Miami-Dade
Police Department.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.900
I need to ask you a few questions.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.500
About what?

17:56.300 --> 17:57.800
An arson that happened this morning.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.700
Could you tell me why your prints

17:59.700 --> 18:01.300
are on broken glass at the crime scene?

18:01.900 --> 18:03.500
What? I don't know.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.500
Maybe I did a job there in the past.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.000
In fact, I'm late for one now,
so excuse me.

18:08.700 --> 18:09.800
Get your hands up, Mr. Cramer.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
You carry a concealed weapon?

18:16.300 --> 18:17.500
I have a permit for that.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.100
You never know whose house
you're walking into.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.700
Oh, I think you did.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.200
There's glass on this gun.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.600
I'm willing to bet it matches
the glass from our crime scene.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.600
Okay, fine, listen.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.200
I was on my way to
an emergency call near there,

18:32.200 --> 18:33.900
and I saw smoke
coming out of the house.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.200
Hey!

18:51.300 --> 18:52.600
Anybody in there?!

18:53.200 --> 18:54.200
Hello?!

18:55.300 --> 18:56.700
Things got crazy.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.500
There was no way I could help,
so I got out of there.

18:58.800 --> 18:59.900
Why didn't you
tell me that?

19:00.100 --> 19:02.300
Who's gonna believe
a Good Samaritan with a gun?

19:03.700 --> 19:04.800
Probably no one.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.300
Hey.
Hey.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.700
So you get anything
on Ron Cramer?

19:12.800 --> 19:14.100
He copped to being outside the house,

19:14.100 --> 19:15.200
but claimed he
never went in.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.800
All right, well, now we can prove it.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.300
Fire Rescue just released
the scene; we can go back in.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.400
Great. I'll grab my kit.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.400
You want to ride together?

19:22.200 --> 19:23.000
Yeah.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.900
Life changes that fast.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.200
How's the Mini RAE coming?

20:20.600 --> 20:22.800
It's picking up octane at five parts per million

20:22.800 --> 20:23.700
all over the room.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.500
There's no doubt about it:
this was arson.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.100
Yeah, that explains
the pour pattern on the floor.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.500
The arsonist
poured gasoline everywhere.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.200
It's going to take a while
to get through the debris.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.600
Yeah, Fire Rescue's working that
from their angle.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.600
Got an arson investigator
looking for the point of origin.

20:48.300 --> 20:49.700
Maybe we beat him to it.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.900
Fire did a number on this,
but check it out.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.000
Is that a spark wheel?

21:03.000 --> 21:03.800
It's a lighter.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.500
Melted plastic around it.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.100
Could be our source of ignition.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.900
You know what?
You tell the arson investigator where you found it.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.200
I'm gonna take this to the lab.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.500
Calleigh, have you seen Ryan?

21:47.100 --> 21:48.200
No. Why?

21:48.700 --> 21:50.400
Well, he said he got a call
about an old case.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.600
An old case? Which one?

21:51.900 --> 21:52.700
Didn't say.

21:52.800 --> 21:53.700
Sounded important.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.400
Well, then I'm sure it was.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.200
What you got there?

21:57.200 --> 21:58.300
It's a cigarette
lighter.

21:58.300 --> 21:59.600
Eric found it at the crime scene.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.300
So it might have started the fire.

22:03.300 --> 22:04.100
Maybe.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.300
But get this; this is sort of interesting.

22:06.300 --> 22:08.400
The fire compromised
evidence on one side,

22:08.400 --> 22:09.400
but then the plastic melted,

22:09.400 --> 22:10.900
and it acted like
sort of a cocoon,

22:10.900 --> 22:12.200
protecting the other side.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.300
And protecting the evidence.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.100
Including a fingerprint.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.100
Nice.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.400
I'm running it against
our elimination samples.

22:22.000 --> 22:22.800
Mmm.

22:23.700 --> 22:24.900
Doesn't match up with anyone.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.000
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.400
Claire Gibbs?

22:30.900 --> 22:32.000
Isn't that the fiance?

22:39.800 --> 22:40.600
What is it?

22:42.500 --> 22:43.800
It's Anthony, isn't it?

22:44.500 --> 22:45.700
You weren't able to catch him.

22:46.300 --> 22:47.800
I knew he would get away with this.

22:47.800 --> 22:48.900
He always does.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.100
Our evidence has led us
in a different direction:

22:53.000 --> 22:53.900
yours.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.400
Me?You think that
I had something to do with this?

22:58.400 --> 23:00.000
We found a lighter
on the living room floor

23:00.000 --> 23:01.500
with your fingerprint on it.

23:02.100 --> 23:02.700
On a lighter?

23:02.700 --> 23:03.900
I don't even smoke.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.000
Exactly.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.700
Well, I have no idea.

23:10.300 --> 23:11.100
I swear.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.900
Wait, I did find a lighter
at my house yesterday,

23:14.900 --> 23:15.900
but it wasn't mine.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.600
Do you have any idea
who it belongs to?

23:26.700 --> 23:28.100
Brett's business partner.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.300
He dropped it
and I gave it back to him.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.100
What was he doing
at the house?

23:35.200 --> 23:37.200
They own a big
event planning company.

23:38.100 --> 23:41.000
They do club openings,
upscale parties.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.000
Do you have any idea
what they talked about?

23:43.000 --> 23:43.700
No.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.300
But they argued,
and it got pretty heated.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.600
This, uh, business partner--
what's his name?

23:51.400 --> 23:52.500
Jeff.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.100
Jeff Zader.

24:12.100 --> 24:13.100
Is this about Brett?

24:16.700 --> 24:17.900
I heard what happened.
It's...

24:18.600 --> 24:19.400
it's horrible.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.300
The world keeps turning,
right?

24:22.300 --> 24:23.300
Yes, it does.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.600
We found your lighter
at Brett's house.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.800
What? Do you think
I burned up his place?

24:28.200 --> 24:29.900
No way.
I got nothing to do with that.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.400
Then why was your
lighter get there?

24:32.300 --> 24:33.200
I don't know.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.300
I must have dropped it.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.100
I also heard you had
an argument with him.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.400
I'm not going to lie
to you.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.700
Brett was bringing
his personal problems to work.

24:42.700 --> 24:44.000
What kind of problems?

24:44.100 --> 24:46.000
His fiance's ex-boyfriend,
for one.

24:46.000 --> 24:46.900
Guy was crazy.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.500
He'd show up at our events.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.700
Slash the guests' tires.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.600
He'd put dead animals in the air vents.

24:51.900 --> 24:52.800
Plug up the toilets.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.900
It was a PR nightmare.

24:54.900 --> 24:57.600
So, his problems were
affecting your bottom line.

24:58.000 --> 24:58.800
Yeah.

24:58.900 --> 25:00.400
I've been scrambling
to make things right.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.300
I was going...
was going to buy Brett out.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Cut him loose.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.500
Yes, and his death would have
been a convenience for you.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.000
Where were you last night?

25:12.700 --> 25:13.600
I was at home.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.400
Trying to think of a way
to save my company.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.900
Can anyone verify that?

25:18.100 --> 25:18.800
No.

25:19.000 --> 25:19.900
I was alone.

25:22.100 --> 25:23.300
Look, I didn't do this.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.800
What can I do to prove
that I wasn't involved?

25:27.800 --> 25:29.900
that is my job.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.600
So, why are we out here?

25:46.600 --> 25:48.900
I tracked Michael Lipton
to four locations,

25:49.600 --> 25:50.800
all of them
secluded.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.500
Possible drug dealing?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.600
No, I don't think so.

25:55.600 --> 25:58.100
From what I could tell,
he's just a bookie.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.600
But I found something else.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.000
Something you're not going
to like.

26:03.900 --> 26:06.300
I shot this video
in North Bay Village.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.200
What am I looking at?

26:20.600 --> 26:22.900
There is money in this
envelope, Horatio.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.800
Maybe he had a good reason
for it.

26:35.700 --> 26:37.000
What if he doesn't?

26:41.500 --> 26:42.600
H, you wanted to see me?

26:43.400 --> 26:44.800
Have a seat, Mr. Wolfe.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.100
Michael Lipton.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.500
Yeah, Michael Lipton is a, uh...

27:05.200 --> 27:06.300
he's a friend of mine.

27:06.700 --> 27:07.500
Why do you ask?

27:07.700 --> 27:09.300
You interrogated him this morning.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.300
Actually, I recused myself
from interrogating him

27:15.300 --> 27:16.600
because I, um...

27:17.300 --> 27:19.200
well, I thought
it'd be looked on as a...

27:20.300 --> 27:21.500
conflict of interest.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.400
I have a piece of videotape
that says otherwise.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.300
I don't know what you saw
on that videotape.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.200
Mr. Wolfe,

27:37.200 --> 27:38.600
I need to know what's going on.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.600
Michael's a friend of mine.

27:47.700 --> 27:50.400
Who's having some sort
of financial problems.

27:50.700 --> 27:51.900
And I'm just helping him out.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.700
So this has nothing to do
with gambling.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.400
No, this has nothing to do with gambling.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.000
If there's something
I should know,

27:58.000 --> 27:59.400
this is your opportunity.

28:03.300 --> 28:04.800
No, there's nothing you need to know.

28:07.700 --> 28:09.300
And this is my personal business.

28:11.300 --> 28:12.500
I'd like to keep it that way.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.400
If you don't level with me
right now,

28:14.800 --> 28:16.800
you're not going to have
a choice, you understand?

28:18.500 --> 28:19.700
Yeah, I understand.

28:36.700 --> 28:37.600
Are we done?

28:40.400 --> 28:41.300
We're done.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.300
Okay.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.100
Hey, you called?

29:02.200 --> 29:02.800
Yeah.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.700
Guess what?
Our arson investigator discovered

29:06.700 --> 29:08.300
that the point of origin
is in this room.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.400
The lighter didn't start the fire.

29:10.700 --> 29:13.300
No.
Okay,what did?

29:14.200 --> 29:16.200
There's no evidence of
low burn on the floor.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.400
No, there's no gasoline
poured in here,

29:18.400 --> 29:20.500
which means that the fire
was started from the vapors.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.200
It was poured
somewhere else in the house

29:22.200 --> 29:23.800
and then it just sat there.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.200
Yeah,as time went on,
the vapors crept across the floor,

29:26.200 --> 29:27.600
making their way
to the water heater.

29:44.700 --> 29:47.000
So the pilot light was our heat source.
-Yeah.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.300
But if the arsonist wanted
to kill Claire and her fiance,

29:49.300 --> 29:51.400
why would he pour gasoline
everywhere else,

29:51.400 --> 29:53.100
and then let the pilot light
ignite the fire?

29:53.300 --> 29:54.400
I don't know.you're right.

29:54.900 --> 29:56.000
A pro wouldn't
chance it.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.300
They would just pour and light.

29:57.700 --> 29:58.500
Yeah.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.100
Well, our arsonist is an amateur.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.500
Never anticipated this.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.100
Maybe they were surprised.

30:03.900 --> 30:04.800
Got interrupted.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.600
An amateur pouring gasoline
probably splashed himself.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.800
Let's get the clothes
from all our suspects.

30:10.100 --> 30:10.900
Yeah.

30:10.900 --> 30:12.900
If he made this mistake,
he probably made others.

30:13.300 --> 30:15.000
Let's sift through the rest
of the debris.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.900
All right, this is where
Ron Cramer broke the glass.

30:31.200 --> 30:31.900
Ow!

30:32.100 --> 30:33.800
Damn it. What happened?

30:34.200 --> 30:35.200
It's a piece of glass.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.800
Hold on a second. Let me see.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.300
Mmm.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.800
That'll teach me to
leap before I look.

30:49.900 --> 30:50.700
Got it.

30:52.100 --> 30:52.900
Eric...

30:59.600 --> 31:00.900
Look, the glass is clean.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.600
Yeah, there's no
smoke stain on it.

31:04.300 --> 31:05.100
No.

31:05.700 --> 31:07.100
You know, your accident
might have just turned

31:07.100 --> 31:08.100
into our biggest lead.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.400
So, you want to tell me
why I'm here?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.300
You didn't go over
to the Morrison house to help.

31:17.300 --> 31:19.000
You went over to set it on fire.

31:19.300 --> 31:20.100
Please.

31:24.600 --> 31:25.800
What's that supposed to be?

31:25.800 --> 31:26.700
It's glass.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.400
From the window
you broke.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.700
Now, you said the fire
was already raging

31:30.700 --> 31:31.900
when you got there, right?

31:32.000 --> 31:32.700
Yeah, it was.

31:32.700 --> 31:33.600
That's impossible.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.700
Glass shards from the point
of entry show no heat damage,

31:36.700 --> 31:37.800
no smoke debris,

31:38.100 --> 31:40.800
which means that you broke the
window before the fire started.

31:57.400 --> 31:58.900
Heat. Fuel. Air.

31:58.900 --> 32:01.100
Until you broke the window,
the ratio was off.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.600
Once you introduced oxygen
to the house,

32:09.600 --> 32:10.900
there was no turning back.

32:28.300 --> 32:31.700
You could say whatever you want,
but I didn't start that fire.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.500
No, you didn't, but you went
over there with your gun.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.200
That's right. You went
over there to kill them,

32:36.200 --> 32:37.700
but the fire beat you to it.

32:42.700 --> 32:43.800
It wasn't my idea.

32:44.400 --> 32:45.200
Whose was it?

32:45.600 --> 32:46.600
It was a guy I know.

32:47.100 --> 32:48.300
Anthony Bryant.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.600
He sent me over to shoot her boyfriend.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.400
He paid me.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.300
But I ain't pull the trigger.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.500
So, I can go, right?

32:56.900 --> 32:58.400
Not even close.

33:08.700 --> 33:10.000
Anthony Bryant?
Yeah?

33:11.400 --> 33:12.600
Miami-Dade PD.

33:12.700 --> 33:13.500
Again?

33:14.100 --> 33:16.600
You know what?
I'd hate to see the way you treat actual criminals.

33:16.600 --> 33:17.800
Somehow you forgot
to tell us

33:17.800 --> 33:19.300
you and Ron Cramer
know each other.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.100
What are you talking about?

33:21.100 --> 33:22.500
Save it. You hired your buddy Ron

33:22.500 --> 33:23.600
to kill Claire Gibbs's fiance.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.600
This is a search warrant
for your vehicle and your home.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.400
Give me your keys.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.200
Give me your keys!

33:32.800 --> 33:34.800
I got a nickel's worth
of advice for you, pal.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.200
When a woman says, "Get lost,"

33:37.600 --> 33:38.500
get lost.

33:38.800 --> 33:39.700
Find another one.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.000
End of story.

33:50.900 --> 33:51.700
Uh-huh.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.100
No.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.000
I usually keep a mapbook
in my glovebox.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.600
If I had to guess,
you stole these

33:59.600 --> 34:01.000
from the woman
you've been stalking.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.400
I've never seen those
in my life.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.700
Oh, really? You can sit outside
her house all night long;

34:04.700 --> 34:06.000
you can't steal her panties?

34:06.000 --> 34:07.800
You know what I call
this, Anthony?
No.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.900
An inciting incident.
You catch my drift?

34:09.900 --> 34:11.699
You know what?
I didn't burn her house, okay.

34:11.900 --> 34:13.699
I didn't hire my friend
to go over and do it.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.100
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:15.100 --> 34:16.800
You're under arrest.
Hook him up.

34:31.100 --> 34:32.500
Thank you for the call, Captain.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.699
So you find anything else?

34:35.300 --> 34:37.000
We were finally able
to get upstairs.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.800
Something in here you should see.

34:41.900 --> 34:42.900
Thank you, gentlemen.

34:44.900 --> 34:46.100
Two more victims.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.400
Victims of something,
but not this fire.

34:48.699 --> 34:50.300
Look at the chest;
there are staples here.

34:50.300 --> 34:52.300
These people have already
been through an autopsy.

34:57.900 --> 34:59.300
These bodies were
probably moved here.

35:00.100 --> 35:03.000
This fire is starting to look
more like a cover-up.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.000
I think it's time we ask
our lone survivor

35:05.000 --> 35:06.100
a few more questions.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.200
Two more bodies at my house?

35:12.700 --> 35:13.800
I don't understand.

35:13.900 --> 35:15.300
They didn't die
in the fire, Claire.

35:15.300 --> 35:16.500
In fact,
they were dead already.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.600
They'd been autopsied, in fact.

35:19.100 --> 35:20.500
Do you want to explain
to me what happened?

35:22.900 --> 35:24.500
Okay, I didn't think so.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.400
So I'm going to tell
you what I know.

35:26.700 --> 35:29.900
For starters, you had gasoline on your
clothes this morning.

35:29.900 --> 35:31.900
Our trace lab just
finished processing them.

35:32.900 --> 35:35.200
That's what the person
used to start the fire, right?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.700
I'm sure I got it on my clothes
when I was trying to escape.

35:42.900 --> 35:44.300
That is not possible.

35:44.300 --> 35:46.600
When gasoline burns,
it becomes carbon dioxide.

35:46.600 --> 35:49.300
There was no carbon dioxide on your clothing;

35:49.300 --> 35:50.700
therefore, it hadn't been burned.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.100
Now what I think, is
that you got gasoline

35:53.100 --> 35:54.800
on your clothes when
you doused the floors.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.800
Do you want to tell
me what happened?

36:01.400 --> 36:02.900
It's Anthony's fault.

36:04.700 --> 36:06.300
He wouldn't leave me alone.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.800
<i>He wouldn't leave us alone.</i>

36:09.500 --> 36:10.900
He did it again, Claire.
He did it again.

36:10.900 --> 36:13.500
Today at my event,
he tripped the sprinklers.
Ruined the entire thing!

36:13.500 --> 36:15.300
Did you call the police?
And what?

36:15.300 --> 36:16.900
File for another
restraining order?

36:20.700 --> 36:22.400
I don't think I can take
this anymore, Claire.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.600
This guy is not going to stop

36:23.600 --> 36:24.800
until he kills us both.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.000
You're right.

36:29.700 --> 36:31.000
Maybe he should.

36:33.300 --> 36:35.100
So you decided to
fake your own deaths?

36:35.900 --> 36:38.300
We were willing to give up
everything to start over

36:38.300 --> 36:40.100
just to be together without him.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.000
And you figured,
if you could burn down

36:42.000 --> 36:44.200
your house, you'd frame
Anthony for your murders.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.000
I put the lingerie in his car

36:48.900 --> 36:50.600
hoping that the cops
would find it.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.200
What about the cadavers?

36:53.600 --> 36:54.900
Brett took care of that.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.700
He got them from the science
department at Dade University.

36:59.300 --> 36:59.900
Okay.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.400
You know,
what I can't figure out is

37:01.400 --> 37:04.100
what were the two of you doing
in bed when the fire started?

37:06.200 --> 37:09.300
Anthony would park outside
of our house every night.

37:11.300 --> 37:12.900
So I poured the gasoline...

37:14.400 --> 37:15.500
and we waited.

37:21.500 --> 37:22.700
You sure he's going to show?

37:23.200 --> 37:24.700
Don't worry. He'll be here.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.400
He's more predictable
than a sunrise.

37:29.300 --> 37:31.700
So you were going to start
the fire when Anthony showed up

37:31.700 --> 37:33.500
hoping that a witness
would place him there.

37:35.900 --> 37:37.000
But he didn't show.

37:38.800 --> 37:42.000
The one night he needed to,
and he didn't.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.800
And Brett and I fell asleep.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.700
And you didn't realize
that the vapors from the gas

37:48.700 --> 37:51.600
had filled the house,
and the flame from the water heater ignited it.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.900
Brett, wake up.
What is that?!

38:13.100 --> 38:14.700
I should have been the one that died.

38:17.100 --> 38:18.400
And now Brett's gone.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.100
He did it.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.100
He won.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.000
Anthony won.

38:30.700 --> 38:31.800
I'm sorry, Claire.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.500
I really am.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.200
But Anthony didn't win,

38:36.200 --> 38:37.800
and we're going
to make sure of that.

38:51.500 --> 38:52.600
Have a seat, Anthony.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.700
She did it, didn't she?

39:07.800 --> 39:09.000
Is Claire going to jail?

39:09.500 --> 39:11.300
No thanks to you, my friend.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.000
Should've never left me.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.100
Think she'll get visitation rights?

39:16.400 --> 39:17.900
I want you to understand something:

39:17.900 --> 39:19.700
you're never going to see her again.

39:21.300 --> 39:23.300
And you lied to me. About what?

39:23.800 --> 39:24.700
The lingerie?

39:25.700 --> 39:27.900
Partly... I never took it.

39:28.300 --> 39:29.500
But I did know it was there.

39:48.100 --> 39:49.100
It was too weird.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.000
I knew she was up to something.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.900
Which is why you hired a
private investigator, isn't it?

39:53.900 --> 39:55.900
Yeah, a good-looking one, too.

39:57.400 --> 39:58.300
You got her number?

39:59.400 --> 40:01.000
I saw you with
her by my car.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.600
The way she looks at you...

40:04.500 --> 40:06.100
think she could look at me
like that?

40:08.200 --> 40:09.800
You were so sure
I killed that guy.

40:10.400 --> 40:13.200
You did hire Ron Cramer
to go over to the house.

40:13.400 --> 40:14.000
What?

40:14.600 --> 40:15.600
Try proving that.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.400
I already have.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.800
We cut a deal with Ron.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.900
I have the check
you used to pay him.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.200
So I paid him.

40:21.700 --> 40:22.900
You said it yourself.

40:23.600 --> 40:24.700
Claire caused the fire.

40:24.700 --> 40:26.700
Yes, but Ron broke
the window, Anthony,

40:26.700 --> 40:28.500
which made the place an inferno.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.100
And in my world, they call that
conspiracy to commit murder.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.500
No way.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.700
I have something new
for you to obsess about.

40:39.600 --> 40:42.500
It's called row of steel bars.

40:43.300 --> 40:44.400
Officer...

41:03.500 --> 41:04.900
I can't let you on
this floor, Wolfe.

41:06.000 --> 41:06.800
What?

41:07.500 --> 41:08.400
Well, you're fired.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.300
Your gun and your
badge, please.

41:20.100 --> 41:22.500
You know, I wouldn't expect
someone like you to understand.

41:23.700 --> 41:24.600
What I did...

41:26.100 --> 41:28.200
I did to protect
all the people in this lab.

41:28.500 --> 41:29.500
You understand that?

41:29.600 --> 41:30.400
You don't get it.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.900
Because of your actions,

41:32.300 --> 41:34.000
cases are being reopened.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.100
Criminals are going
to be out on the streets.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.400
Your personal belongings
will be sent to you.

41:41.300 --> 41:44.700
I need your gun and I
need your badge... now.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.200
What am I supposed to do now?

42:03.500 --> 42:04.500
Get out of the building.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.400
I heard you got Anthony.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.000
I appreciate your help on this.

42:28.500 --> 42:29.600
It's part of the job.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.200
Speaking of which, Yelina,

42:32.200 --> 42:34.300
PI work can be very dangerous.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.000
Ray was killed
while breaking the law.

42:38.300 --> 42:41.000
I was denied his pension.
I have to work...

42:41.100 --> 42:41.900
Yelina...

42:44.200 --> 42:45.100
I was a cop.

42:45.500 --> 42:47.000
I can take care of myself.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.600
I'm concerned about people
like Anthony Bryant.

42:50.700 --> 42:51.800
I understand.

42:52.100 --> 42:54.300
Really, but I have Ray Junior
to think about.

42:54.300 --> 42:55.500
My point exactly.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.700
Always looking after me, huh?

43:00.200 --> 43:01.200
I always will.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.400
I'll be more selective next time.
