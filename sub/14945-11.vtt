Okay, Alec,
I need to know
I can trust you.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.015
You can.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.050
When I ask you
for information,

00:19.145 --> 00:20.681
I expect you to leave
nothing out.

In case
you were wondering.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.266
The CMR records
our memories.

01:01.646 --> 01:03.477
What happens to them?

01:03.564 --> 01:06.101
The buffer is 36 hours,
give or take.

01:06.359 --> 01:08.725
So, they get recorded
over and then erased,
right?

01:09.487 --> 01:10.567
Pretty much.

01:10.821 --> 01:13.312

as a severe cyber terror

02:38.868 --> 02:41.826
Let's put our energy
into stopping
these hackers.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.119
So far, the spread
seems almost random.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.413
It's something like 10%
of affected accounts

02:46.500 --> 02:48.365
have been accessed,
but as news travels,

02:48.461 --> 02:50.076
that number's going
to jump exponentially.

02:50.171 --> 02:53.459
So if it isn't Liber8,
it's some zealot hacker
who's riding the wave.

it'll stop there, either.

everyone's e-mail accounts,
what's next?

connected to Liber8.

swings both ways.

If that's how he did it,
if he stole it
from me somehow...

11:17.135 --> 11:20.923
Okay, listen.
Find out what you can,
and let me handle it.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.713
Roger that.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.514
Sky Train's
been shut down.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.387
lrregularities in
the computer system.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.393
He's escalating the hacks.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.224
Alec have anything?
Not yet.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.769
But I've never heard him
this upset.

11:37.281 --> 11:40.148
I'm actually a little
concerned for Julian.

11:42.995 --> 11:44.405
Should be.

11:56.174 --> 11:59.302
KIERA: Do you deny
any involvement in
these cyber-attacks?

11:59.386 --> 12:00.751
Well, I mean,
this wouldn't be
the first time

12:00.846 --> 12:03.258
you've mistakenly confused
my agenda with Liber8's.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.847
They want to
blow up the world
and start all over,

12:05.934 --> 12:07.219
what makes you
any different?

12:07.311 --> 12:09.802
I believe this revolution
is fought one heart,

12:10.188 --> 12:11.928
one mind ata time.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.935
How's that working out
for you?

12:14.026 --> 12:15.516
I mean, our cause is
aided as much by those

12:15.611 --> 12:18.603
who refuse to listen to us
as those with open minds.

12:18.697 --> 12:19.937
You know what I hear?

12:20.198 --> 12:23.736
The same old whiney bullshit
that agitators like you

12:23.827 --> 12:26.614
always trot out to play
on people's fears.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.908
I didn't come here looking
for converts.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.785
Then why did
you come here?

12:30.918 --> 12:33.580
Well, the police have
been tearing up the town
looking for me,

12:33.670 --> 12:35.126
thought I'd voluntarily
turn myself in.

12:35.213 --> 12:38.501
I mean, what are the odds
I would have taken a bullet
fired in self-defense?

12:38.884 --> 12:40.169
That's not what we do.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.175
Really?

12:42.262 --> 12:45.504
Are you speaking for
yesterday's police
or today's?

12:46.516 --> 12:48.893
KIERA: So you walk
into the lion's den.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.263
Well, I'd like to
report a crime.

12:51.355 --> 12:54.097
A crime against humanity,
assuming that that is
an actionable offense.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.306
Julian,
stop playing games.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.608
There are
no TV cameras here,

12:58.695 --> 13:00.981
and this isn't our first
psychopath rodeo.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.779
Oh, I'm dead serious.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.528
And who are you accusing
of these crimes?

13:05.702 --> 13:07.533
My stepbrother, Alec.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.711
(BEEPING)

13:21.218 --> 13:23.630
Listen to this!
Cash machines on tilt,

13:23.720 --> 13:26.097
people's credit card
balances being zeroed out,

13:26.181 --> 13:27.136
whoever our
cyber-terrorist is,

13:27.224 --> 13:30.307
they've figured out they
can catch a lot more bees
with honey than vinegar.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.467
What did you want
to show me?

13:33.480 --> 13:34.936
(SIGHS) Remember
how you asked me

13:35.023 --> 13:36.103
if somebody could
have hijacked Arc?

13:36.608 --> 13:37.643
This is not starting well.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.690
Well, some of the code used
by the hackers reminds me

13:39.778 --> 13:42.645
of the viruses
that Lucas wrote
in order to hijack your CMR.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.900
Now, this doesn't explain
the similarities to Arc,

13:44.992 --> 13:46.857
but then I remembered
Julian stole my cell phone.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.864
So, you think Julian might
have given your cell phone
to Lucas?

13:49.955 --> 13:53.163
Lucas could have recovered
some ofArc's source code
through its memory.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.956
Now, combined with the fact
that he has other segments

13:55.043 --> 13:57.955
for the time travel device
for processing...

13:58.046 --> 13:59.206
Now I feel sick.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.583
But, there is
a bright side.

14:02.759 --> 14:06.092
If he is using my code,
then I can just hijack one
of the servers he's using

14:06.179 --> 14:08.465
and grab a fix
on his location
next time he connects.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.145
You've shown
great courage.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.231
That means a lot coming
from you.

14:25.991 --> 14:28.573
Courage and stupidity.

14:29.703 --> 14:30.909
I don't understand.

14:30.996 --> 14:33.112
You've forgotten
the core mission.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.195
I... I'm sorry, I...

14:34.291 --> 14:37.499
These actions are supposed
to wake the people up

14:37.586 --> 14:39.622
from their gradual slip
into unconsciousness.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.670
We have.
They're taking notice.

14:42.799 --> 14:47.168
Yes, but you have
to capitalize

14:47.262 --> 14:49.093
on their attention
while you have it!

14:49.806 --> 14:50.886
How?

14:51.516 --> 14:53.177
There's a tsunami
on its way.

14:53.602 --> 14:54.967
A tsunami?

14:56.688 --> 14:57.973
It's a metaphor.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.389
Alec Sadler.

15:00.484 --> 15:01.473
Yes.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.817
But there is another.

15:06.531 --> 15:07.646
Me?

15:08.825 --> 15:11.692
You swore an oath
to fight for liberty.

15:12.204 --> 15:16.197
Now, circumstance has
provided you the opportunity

15:16.291 --> 15:17.656
to shape the future.

15:18.168 --> 15:21.251
Honor that commitment,
and avert a destiny

15:21.338 --> 15:24.956
the world might
not otherwise survive.

15:49.699 --> 15:50.825
I don't get it,
he was here!

15:50.909 --> 15:52.900
Accuracy is two meters.

15:54.037 --> 15:57.905
There was a vehicle
parked here less than
10 minutes ago, tops.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.619
So he's doing all this
from a moving vehicle.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.575
He's like a human scud!

16:04.714 --> 16:06.545
He's safe as long as
he keeps on moving.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.793
Once he comes to
rest long enough,

16:07.884 --> 16:09.499
we'll be there to
haul in his ass.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.214
Excuse me?

16:13.014 --> 16:14.970
You know, you'll make
the arrest.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.720
Oh, yeah, that's what
I thought you said.

16:18.562 --> 16:19.847
(SIGHS)

16:24.901 --> 16:25.856
I'll do my best.

16:25.944 --> 16:26.979
Thank you.
Okay.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.810
Candidate Martin,
what is your response

16:28.905 --> 16:30.281
to the release of
decrypted e-mails

16:30.365 --> 16:31.980
between you and
Sonya Valentine,

16:32.075 --> 16:34.361
one of the architects
of Liber8?

16:37.747 --> 16:38.827
Let's face it.

16:38.915 --> 16:42.407
The current atmosphere
is rife with opportunity
for malicious slander.

16:42.752 --> 16:46.495
So you deny a business
or personal relationship
with Miss Valentine?

16:46.590 --> 16:49.923
I can assure you, the arrest
of Sonya Valentine and Liber8

16:50.010 --> 16:51.750
will be one of
my first priorities.

16:52.387 --> 16:53.752
Thank you.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.931
Ifyou don't get out
in front of this,

16:59.019 --> 17:00.555
it'll bring us both down.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.761
I know.
I'm working on it.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.263
Work harder.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.020
I've got my own problems.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.359
The police want
to bring me in
for questioning.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.684
You threw me
under the bus.

17:50.779 --> 17:53.270
Our association
could never come out.
You knew that.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.071
Except that
you're supposed
to find a way

17:55.158 --> 17:58.116
to legitimize our cause,
and me with it.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.569
Well, that can't happen
if I don't win the election.

18:00.664 --> 18:02.700
And even if I do win,
it'll take time.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.491
More time now,
with Julian destroying

18:05.585 --> 18:07.667
every opportunity I had to
work behind the scenes.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.494
We had a deal, Jim.

18:10.632 --> 18:13.248
Don't try to weasel
your way out of it
with politics as usual

18:13.343 --> 18:15.083
or you'll wind up
like the last mayor.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.671
Sonya, we both want
the same things.

18:19.224 --> 18:22.091
Give me a chance
to start the process
that leads us forward.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.051
A chance.

18:26.398 --> 18:27.683
One more thing.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.275
Julian Randol.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.524
When he's found,
lwanna see him.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.186
I'll see what I can do.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.205
All this chaos...

18:51.047 --> 18:53.379
E-mails,
bank accounts, the grid.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.379
It's Arc, isn't it?

18:59.764 --> 19:02.016
Alec,
you can stop it.

19:03.268 --> 19:06.226
The only way to do that
is to completely destroy
the program.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.855
Exactly.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.227
Kellog has way too much
money invested in it.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.398
He wouldn't be happy.

19:13.111 --> 19:16.478
Is it Kellog's happiness
that you're really
concerned about?

19:34.799 --> 19:35.959
If your friend Jim wins,

19:36.051 --> 19:38.758
it could be
the shortest term
a mayor ever served.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.752
He did come in voluntarily
for questioning.

19:41.598 --> 19:44.431
Remind him while
the walls are down
we have the upper hand.

19:45.435 --> 19:48.177
Don't kid yourself.
We use that sword
on Jim, it cuts both ways.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.441
I’m no politician.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.360
All I know is things
will go better for you

19:57.447 --> 20:00.405
ifyou just came clean
and got out in front
of this thing.

20:02.619 --> 20:03.984
These radicals.

20:04.079 --> 20:06.365
They hack
the Internet two days
before the election,

20:06.456 --> 20:08.538
and then miraculously
uncover a wealth of dirt,

20:08.625 --> 20:09.910
including my ties
to them.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.291
So, you were setup.

20:12.629 --> 20:13.835
That's what I'm supposed
to believe.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.413
Carlos,
from what I've heard,

20:17.509 --> 20:19.374
your department's
been bought lock,
stock and barrel

20:19.469 --> 20:23.053
by a man whose interests
have nothing to do
with the public's.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.130
That doesn't trouble you?

20:27.519 --> 20:28.725
Look”.

20:28.812 --> 20:32.896
I don't make the call
aboutwhich, ifany,
of these charges hold water.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.142
That's above my pay grade.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.941
Maybe I should
be grateful for that.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.192
So you want to know
if Piron is making
any moves

20:41.282 --> 20:43.409
beyond this whole police
privatization thing?

20:43.493 --> 20:44.482
Well, during
the cyber-attacks,

20:44.577 --> 20:46.568
I copied some confidential
security filings.

20:46.663 --> 20:49.120
Escher put out big money
to take over a tech company,

20:49.207 --> 20:50.868
LaRoche Energy Systems.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.915
Kiera investigated
a murder at their lab
a few months ago.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.208
Stay on Escher.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.911
He's poured millions
into fast-tracking
their fusion experiments.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.497
He's decades ahead
of anyone in creating
stable anti-matter.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.135
What does he want
with anti-matter?

21:05.723 --> 21:07.509
And try not to say it
in nerd.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.803
(SIGHING) Okay,
the simple version?

21:09.894 --> 21:11.885
He plans on becoming
the richest man on Earth

21:11.980 --> 21:14.437
with what could be
possibly the greatest,
if not the only,

21:14.524 --> 21:15.980
real alternative
to fossil fuels.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.148
Assume it's not that.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.067
Think nefarious.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.650
Also, underhanded,
amoral, and greedy.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.899
Are we still talking
about Escher?

21:28.413 --> 21:31.450
Okay, theoretically,
he could develop
this technology

21:31.541 --> 21:33.827
to power the time
travel device.

21:34.461 --> 21:38.045
If it ever
gets whole again,
the sky's the limit.

21:55.857 --> 21:57.643
You're Julian Randol.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.018
You're the new mayor.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.231
Maybe.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.363
They arrest you?

22:05.450 --> 22:07.236
They certainly tried.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.325
You?
Questioning.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.740
It's not a good day
to be a politician.

row on the same waters.

22:21.591 --> 22:22.671
We know how to
build a following,

22:22.759 --> 22:24.124
and we both
know how to use it.

it looks like a mess.

Well, then I'll just have
to clean it up.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.800
How did you find me?

23:16.437 --> 23:18.974
I think we both know
it wasn't easy.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.939
Well, I hope it's worth
the trouble.

have mutual interests.

we're both working
from the same play book.

on each other's toes here,

sooner or later one of us
is bound to get annoyed
and push back.

24:00.690 --> 24:02.305
My money's on me,
by the way.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.066
I'll take those odds.

24:08.698 --> 24:09.858
This...

24:12.827 --> 24:15.614
This confidence is
just a facade for you,
isn't it?

24:17.915 --> 24:19.576
Somewhere to hide?

24:21.711 --> 24:23.872
Well, you can't
hide forever.

24:26.549 --> 24:29.712
I'm not hiding, Matthew.

24:31.262 --> 24:32.798
I'm right here.

24:35.558 --> 24:36.764
(CHUCKLES)

24:39.228 --> 24:41.890
Well, we all have
our secrets, don't we?

24:43.066 --> 24:45.148
It's just a matter of time.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.077
Lucas is playing
video games

24:55.161 --> 24:56.901
with the city's
infrastructure right now,

24:56.996 --> 24:58.577
and you want me to
worry about Escher?

24:59.082 --> 25:01.869
He's bought into
the leading edge
of anti-matter research.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.244
He's ramping up
production.

25:03.461 --> 25:06.578
He's got
the police department
in his hip pocket.

25:06.881 --> 25:08.417
Sound familiar?

25:11.636 --> 25:14.127
I can't buy him out,
how about you?

25:14.222 --> 25:17.760
lwas thinking
something more efficient
and non-recurring.

25:22.063 --> 25:25.100
How do you keep
those hands so clean,
Matthew?

25:26.317 --> 25:29.775
Oh, I know.
It's because you're
a businessman now.

25:30.905 --> 25:33.442
Execute trades,
execute competitors,

25:33.533 --> 25:35.694
it's all the same
in the end.

25:36.577 --> 25:39.068
The single biggest threat
to our cause is Escher.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.697
If Kagame were here,
he'd agree.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.282
Kagame is here.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.370
In spirit, I'm sure.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.547
Come here.

25:52.677 --> 25:54.759
He thinks he's working
with a dead man.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.136
Really?

25:58.474 --> 25:59.554
What's happened to him?

25:59.642 --> 26:00.882
I'm not sure.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.842
He's clearly gone mad.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.811
I'm concerned
it's a side effect
of the time travel.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.477
You have anything for me?

26:12.822 --> 26:16.406
Kiera's pretty sure
that Lucas is behind it
and can intercept.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.198
Julian Randol just
walked out of here

26:18.286 --> 26:20.743
because I don't
have a damn thing
to hold him on.

26:20.830 --> 26:23.572
ljust yanked the next
possible mayor
of this city in

26:23.666 --> 26:25.907
for an interrogation,
but I can't hold him

26:26.002 --> 26:29.039
because the prosecutors
can't agree on charges.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.920
Somebody's head needs
to be delivered.

26:38.181 --> 26:39.842

he's close to losing it.

26:42.769 --> 26:45.135

I can try.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.275
Well, hello!

27:00.495 --> 27:01.484
Where's Lucas?

27:01.871 --> 27:03.611
Why do I only
get the pleasure
of your visits

27:03.706 --> 27:04.821
when you need something
from me?

27:05.208 --> 27:08.041
Start talking about
Lucas, or I will take
a renewed interest

27:08.127 --> 27:10.368
in what you're
actually up to.

27:11.714 --> 27:14.376
I wasn't a fan of Lucas
when his head
was screwed on.

27:15.343 --> 27:16.503
Meaning?

27:18.429 --> 27:20.420
He's having full-blown
hallucinations.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.131
He's convinced Kagame
is still alive.

27:23.893 --> 27:26.475
Sonya thinks
it's a time travel thing,
he's been scrambled.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.894
Temporal dislocation, yeah.

27:29.232 --> 27:30.392
I've seen it.

27:30.900 --> 27:31.889
Have you felt it?

27:33.236 --> 27:34.316
You?

27:35.905 --> 27:37.816
Only when I'm with you.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.902
Lucas is convinced
he can see Kagame?

27:41.244 --> 27:42.609
See him, hear him.

27:42.703 --> 27:44.489
Play chess with him,
you name it.

27:45.164 --> 27:48.247
Crazy plus dead
equals chaos.

27:58.427 --> 27:59.928

to let up.

28:00.263 --> 28:01.628
I'm not.

You've sown fear.

we've turned into

29:07.955 --> 29:09.946
How are we gonna
deal with that?

29:11.083 --> 29:12.493
You could hold
a press conference.

40:36.518 --> 40:37.849
Thanks for turning
a blind eye.

40:38.145 --> 40:39.851
I have my moments.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.095
And apparently friends
in high places.

40:43.859 --> 40:45.770
You do realize now
Jim has oversight

40:45.861 --> 40:48.147
over the police department.

41:07.549 --> 41:08.880

41:33.075 --> 41:34.611
I think it's only right
that you should do it.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.096
Welcome to
your new home.
