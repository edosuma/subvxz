01:09.971 --> 01:11.673
- Yoko.
- <i>What is wrong?</i>

01:11.806 --> 01:13.675
I'm just leaving
the Williams' house now.

01:13.808 --> 01:15.610
Jennifer's out
and Emma's asleep.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.979
I'll leave the keys with Alex
at the care center

01:18.111 --> 01:19.446
before I head to the airport.

01:19.581 --> 01:20.915
- <i>Did something happen?</i>
- No, I...

01:21.049 --> 01:23.585
- <i>What is wrong?</i>
- I need to go home.

01:23.718 --> 01:25.820
I know I made
a longer commitment,

01:25.954 --> 01:28.288
but I need to get back
to my family.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.558
I can't explain it.
It's like something...

01:32.192 --> 01:34.062
I just need to get back
to the States.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.564
<i>You were
supposed to stay for a few...</i>

01:36.698 --> 01:38.465
Yoko? Yoko?

01:40.334 --> 01:41.536
Yoko.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.153
Where...?

02:33.286 --> 02:34.756
- Oh, hey.
- Mommy!

02:34.889 --> 02:36.791
- You guys, I'm home.
- Welcome back.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.459
- You made it. Heh, heh.
- Oh, my love.

02:39.594 --> 02:40.995
Welcome home.

02:41.129 --> 02:42.930
Oh, it's so good to be home.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.768
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.078
Burke? Time to go!

03:30.210 --> 03:31.278
Burke.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.684
Burke?

03:36.818 --> 03:39.053
Hey, what you doing, bud?
What's going on?

03:39.187 --> 03:41.488
Come on, we gotta go now.
Stop playing with that.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.658
Me and Daddy never finished it.

03:54.669 --> 03:55.737
Come here.

03:59.741 --> 04:02.110
I miss Daddy.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.477
I miss him too.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.347
So much.

04:10.885 --> 04:13.187
And that's okay
because we're supposed to.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.695
I think this move's gonna be
really good for us.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.730
It's gonna be a new place.

04:22.864 --> 04:24.165
And a new start.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.970
Nothing bad's gonna
happen to me, okay?

04:29.103 --> 04:31.839
Nothing bad's gonna happen
to you either.

04:31.973 --> 04:34.075
I promise.
And it means more

04:34.208 --> 04:36.144
because I'm a police officer.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.647
Come on. I know
first days are hard,

04:39.781 --> 04:42.083
but you gotta do it,
like ripping off a Band-Aid.

04:42.216 --> 04:43.483
I'm scared.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.090
I'm scared too.

04:51.726 --> 04:53.227
What do we do
when we're scared?

04:53.360 --> 04:56.197
Close your eyes
and count to five.

04:56.329 --> 04:57.464
Right.

05:01.269 --> 05:06.107
One, two, three...

05:06.240 --> 05:07.942
four...

05:08.075 --> 05:09.309
five.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.246
Everything's okay.

05:13.413 --> 05:14.782
Let's go to school.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.118
Ready?

05:37.972 --> 05:41.776
<i>"The lights are on,
but nobody's home."</i>

06:08.636 --> 06:10.705
<i>I hear they stuck
you with the new chick.</i>

06:10.838 --> 06:13.174
Don't call them
"chicks."

06:13.307 --> 06:16.911
Buddy of mine in Vice said
her old man died of cancer.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.081
Real brutal. Kid was
alone with him when he died.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.849
It's only been three months.

06:32.492 --> 06:33.393
Muldoon?

06:35.096 --> 06:36.297
Yeah.

06:55.716 --> 06:56.717
Smoke?

06:56.851 --> 06:58.085
Nah, I quit.

07:00.221 --> 07:01.488
Mind if I do?

07:01.622 --> 07:02.757
Go ahead.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.871
How are you
liking it around here?

07:18.739 --> 07:21.909
Uh, we're still
getting settled in.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.381
It's definitely different.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.817
How does something
like this even happen?

08:02.950 --> 08:04.585
Car's been here for months.

08:04.719 --> 08:06.554
Doors were locked
when we found it.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.456
Gruesome, huh?

08:08.589 --> 08:10.324
I'll say.

08:10.458 --> 08:11.859
Got an ID yet?

08:11.993 --> 08:12.960
Sure do.

08:13.094 --> 08:15.629
Got Lorna Moody, 65.

08:15.763 --> 08:19.433
Why did it take so long
to find her?

08:19.567 --> 08:21.268
Well, this here's
a service road.

08:21.402 --> 08:24.305
They only just started
using it for the season.

08:24.438 --> 08:27.041
Anyone come looking for her?

08:27.174 --> 08:30.845
That's just it. The feds,
they're already looking for her.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.514
Turns out she's one of those
assisted-suicide broads.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.049
Find anything on her?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.884
Usual stuff.

08:37.018 --> 08:39.086
I got an address though.

08:39.220 --> 08:41.689
Directions
in the glove box.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.491
44 Reyburn Drive.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.827
Same place
as the Landers case.

08:50.131 --> 08:51.599
Looks like
we got another one.

08:51.732 --> 08:52.933
Another what?

08:56.570 --> 08:58.172
What was
the Landers case?

09:02.043 --> 09:03.310
Anything else?

09:03.444 --> 09:06.047
Forensics will be here soon.

09:06.180 --> 09:07.982
The FBI is on its way too.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.086
Sure looks like something
was in there with her.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.557
You ever seen anything
like this one before?

09:16.690 --> 09:18.059
Detective...

09:20.461 --> 09:22.263
What's up with
the Landers house?

09:25.132 --> 09:27.368
Worked a case there,
two years ago.

09:28.803 --> 09:31.205
- Sort of stuck with me.
- Mm.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.774
And it's...

09:33.908 --> 09:36.477
just strange to see it
pop up again.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.212
Maybe they're connected.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.716
It's just a weird coincidence.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.170
"Entire family murdered."

10:36.605 --> 10:39.106
Hey! Put that shit away
before Goodman sees you.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.442
- Why?
- He worked that case there.

10:41.576 --> 10:45.312
He never set foot inside.
Never seen a cop do that before.

12:08.429 --> 12:09.797
Hello?

12:12.567 --> 12:15.035
Police department.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.338
I just want to go.

12:35.690 --> 12:36.924
Hello?

12:39.059 --> 12:40.861
Police department.

12:56.910 --> 13:00.014
I just want to go.
Will you take me?

13:00.147 --> 13:01.815
- Hello?
- Take me home.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.285
I don't want to be here.

13:26.708 --> 13:28.142
Chicken for dinner.

13:30.144 --> 13:31.979
Chicken for dinner.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.648
We're gonna have...

13:39.253 --> 13:40.921
Are you Mrs. Matheson?

13:51.298 --> 13:53.000
I'm Detective Muldoon.

13:56.337 --> 13:58.372
Gonna talk to you
about a woman we found.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.684
Will you feed me?

14:10.951 --> 14:12.086
Excuse me?

14:14.855 --> 14:16.056
William, my...

14:16.190 --> 14:18.025
He always used to
feed me.

14:20.795 --> 14:22.530
William was your husband?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.576
Ma'am, are you alone
in the house right now?

14:35.810 --> 14:38.546
Will you help me, please?

14:38.680 --> 14:39.714
Help me.

14:39.848 --> 14:42.316
Help me, help me.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.084
Help me.

14:44.218 --> 14:46.887
Please! No, please!
Don't leave!

14:47.020 --> 14:49.923
- Stay there, I'm gonna get help.
- No, no, no! No!

14:50.057 --> 14:51.626
Help me!

14:51.760 --> 14:53.227
No!

14:53.360 --> 14:54.962
Don't leave me!

14:55.095 --> 14:56.631
No!

14:56.765 --> 14:58.465
Don't leave me.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.401
Do not leave me!

15:00.535 --> 15:02.102
Please don't leave me.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.303
Don't leave...

15:22.757 --> 15:24.526
Car 646, we need an ambulance

15:24.659 --> 15:26.460
to 44 Reyburn Drive.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.339
What the fuck was that?

17:06.728 --> 17:08.930
I heard you the first time!

17:17.906 --> 17:19.406
What are you doing here?

17:20.808 --> 17:22.510
I went to the house.

17:24.646 --> 17:26.046
There's another body.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.417
Come in.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.356
<i>This is my body,
which is given...</i>

17:36.490 --> 17:38.560
The Landers was just...

17:38.693 --> 17:40.695
one of those cases.

17:40.828 --> 17:42.697
Total mess.

17:42.830 --> 17:45.867
Whole family murdered
at the house on Reyburn.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.436
The neighbors too.
Fiona Landers...

17:49.571 --> 17:51.873
She murdered
her 6-year-old daughter.

17:52.006 --> 17:54.576
And then she killed
her husband.

17:54.709 --> 17:56.209
And then herself.

18:00.548 --> 18:02.984
You think the body
that we found was related?

18:04.284 --> 18:06.988
I can't go down
the same road again.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.632
Why did you never
go into the house?

18:20.267 --> 18:22.503
Something never
felt right about it.

18:24.038 --> 18:25.138
Just...

18:26.708 --> 18:28.610
didn't feel right.

18:31.012 --> 18:32.780
What do you mean?

18:32.914 --> 18:34.882
My old partner, he was obsessed.

18:35.016 --> 18:36.818
He said there was...

18:36.951 --> 18:38.786
energy.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.789
Mm, spirits.

18:41.923 --> 18:43.625
Something like that.

18:43.758 --> 18:45.927
You saying
the house is haunted?

18:46.060 --> 18:47.461
People will think you're crazy

18:47.595 --> 18:49.631
if you start
saying shit like that.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.800
Yeah, well, I don't buy that.

18:55.103 --> 18:56.938
I'm sorry, can I
get you anything?

18:57.071 --> 18:58.940
No, I'm good.

18:59.073 --> 19:00.708
Pie?

19:01.809 --> 19:03.377
- Not that pie.
- Oh, fuck.

19:03.511 --> 19:04.879
Heh, I'm good.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.314
My mother...

19:09.182 --> 19:11.218
she was into
all that ghostly shit.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.721
The older I get,

19:13.855 --> 19:15.657
the more I wanna believe it.

19:15.790 --> 19:17.525
Mm-hm.

19:17.659 --> 19:19.727
- She passed away, huh?
- Yeah.

19:19.861 --> 19:23.998
I just don't have the heart
to get rid of all this.

19:24.132 --> 19:27.001
I still think of this as...

19:27.135 --> 19:28.368
her house.

19:28.503 --> 19:30.805
Yeah, I understand
how that goes.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.175
- How long for you?
- Three months.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.944
It was cancer.

19:39.914 --> 19:42.349
I've seen
how that plays out.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.952
I don't wish that on anyone.

19:47.155 --> 19:50.457
I get you're looking
for distractions right now.

19:50.591 --> 19:52.026
Don't get lost
in this shit.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.062
The case, the house...

20:00.668 --> 20:02.603
I know what that looks like.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.359
<i>Neonatal oncologist to OR 3.</i>

20:26.493 --> 20:28.730
<i>Neonatal oncologist to OR 3.</i>

20:31.032 --> 20:34.569
Don't worry. Amnios are
pretty routine for women your age.

20:36.170 --> 20:38.172
Mm-hm. I'm... I'm ready, thanks.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.339
Okay.

20:39.473 --> 20:41.008
This is the poke.

20:44.045 --> 20:45.046
Mm-hm.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.381
That's the needle.
Does it hurt?

20:48.516 --> 20:50.585
No. It's okay.

20:50.718 --> 20:53.320
This is where
you're gonna feel a cramp.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.722
<i>I have the results.</i>

20:56.057 --> 20:57.225
The amnio confirmed

20:57.357 --> 21:00.762
what we suspected
from the blood work.

21:00.895 --> 21:05.099
The likelihood that your child
will be born with ALD is high.

21:09.036 --> 21:11.072
I know that we've, uh,

21:11.205 --> 21:14.842
previously discussed
various possibilities...

21:14.976 --> 21:17.578
but if you have
any questions now,

21:17.712 --> 21:21.115
I can put you in touch
with some other families.

21:21.249 --> 21:25.186
Helps to hear from other parents
about the realities of this.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.486
But, uh...

21:28.055 --> 21:30.758
there's still a chance, right?

21:30.892 --> 21:32.794
That our baby
will be born healthy?

22:02.990 --> 22:04.625
Reyburn's coming up.
I wanna stop by

22:04.759 --> 22:06.459
and get
the Landers' signature.

22:06.594 --> 22:08.863
Wait, uh...? We have
to do that right now?

22:10.330 --> 22:12.633
- I wanna get it done today.
- Okay.

22:19.774 --> 22:21.042
Be right back.

22:36.023 --> 22:37.124
Hello?

22:38.259 --> 22:39.660
Peter Spencer.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.624
Hello?

23:14.161 --> 23:15.796
Anybody home?

23:18.232 --> 23:20.067
Peter Spencer here.

23:24.538 --> 23:25.806
Hello?

23:32.213 --> 23:33.781
Peter Spencer.

23:47.028 --> 23:48.229
Oh, my God.

23:50.197 --> 23:51.132
Okay.

23:56.537 --> 23:58.039
Unbelievable.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.275
The car's still here.

24:01.409 --> 24:03.711
But nobody's home.

24:03.844 --> 24:06.580
I might have to come back again
tomorrow morning.

24:17.591 --> 24:20.027
So we're not gonna
talk about it?

24:20.161 --> 24:22.096
I don't know
what you want me to say.

24:23.831 --> 24:26.767
I just want you to...

24:26.901 --> 24:30.037
I want us to talk so we can
make this decision together.

24:35.576 --> 24:37.278
Are you mad at me?

24:37.411 --> 24:39.680
No. No.

24:43.584 --> 24:45.353
I'm not mad at you.
I love you.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.822
I love you, so I wanted
to have a family with you.

24:47.955 --> 24:50.758
- I'm not mad at you.
- I know. I love you too.

24:50.891 --> 24:52.360
- I'm sorry.
- No.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.762
I just don't know
what to do.

24:54.895 --> 24:56.430
We'll figure it out.

26:28.789 --> 26:30.559
Will you turn off
the light?

26:30.691 --> 26:32.493
That light's so bright.

26:57.785 --> 26:59.153
Hi.

26:59.286 --> 27:00.421
Hi.

27:03.958 --> 27:06.627
- How you feeling?
- I don't know.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.976
- We'll figure it out.
- Mm-hm.

27:23.944 --> 27:26.480
Breakfast. I'm gonna
make you some breakfast.

27:26.615 --> 27:27.848
You?

27:27.982 --> 27:29.316
What was that?

27:29.450 --> 27:31.485
You're gonna cook?

27:31.620 --> 27:33.220
Yeah, I'm gonna cook.

27:33.354 --> 27:34.655
I'm a good cook.

27:34.788 --> 27:36.690
Wait, you're gonna
burn the place down?

27:38.292 --> 27:40.529
I mean, that's how
we're gonna deal with this?

27:42.029 --> 27:45.366
Yes. I'm gonna murder us
with deliciousness.

27:45.499 --> 27:47.034
Okay.

27:54.609 --> 27:57.945
<i>Windy today with
gusts up to 40 miles per hour.</i>

27:58.078 --> 28:01.148
<i>The temperature dropping
from 59 to...</i>

28:48.829 --> 28:49.863
Hello.

28:51.298 --> 28:55.069
I'm actually
the real estate agent.

29:00.741 --> 29:02.109
Oh, God.

29:03.712 --> 29:04.679
You scared me.

29:07.348 --> 29:08.749
You are...

29:10.017 --> 29:11.620
Melinda, right?

29:13.220 --> 29:14.188
You remember me?

29:16.423 --> 29:18.225
I'm the guy on the sign.

29:21.295 --> 29:23.732
Melinda, sweetheart,
are your parents home?

29:28.035 --> 29:29.103
Oh, God.

29:29.236 --> 29:30.605
Your nose is bleeding...

29:30.739 --> 29:32.741
Sweetheart, let's get you
inside. Come on.

29:37.878 --> 29:39.246
You doing okay?

29:41.650 --> 29:43.417
I think
it's all stopped.

29:44.952 --> 29:46.086
Yeah.

29:52.059 --> 29:54.128
Where are your parents?
Do you know?

29:56.397 --> 29:58.299
Let's try your dad again, huh?

30:00.968 --> 30:04.338
Let's see
if he picks up this time.

30:10.077 --> 30:12.479
<i>Sam Landers. Leave a message.</i>

30:12.614 --> 30:15.349
Hi, Mr. Landers,
this is, uh...

30:15.482 --> 30:17.686
This is Peter Spencer...

30:17.818 --> 30:20.421
um, again.

30:20.555 --> 30:22.691
I'm actually at your house
right now.

30:22.823 --> 30:25.959
I just came by to get
those closing signatures.

30:26.093 --> 30:30.130
Um, I will try you again later.

30:31.298 --> 30:32.667
Um...

30:35.135 --> 30:37.371
Your daughter is here.

30:37.505 --> 30:40.474
Uh, she had a little bit
of a bloody nose,

30:40.608 --> 30:42.510
but she's doing okay now.

30:42.644 --> 30:45.312
Please give me a call
when you get this.

30:49.183 --> 30:52.787
<i>Mommy's friend, Yoko,
taught me how to say,</i> "Moshi moshi."

30:52.920 --> 30:55.222
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

30:55.356 --> 30:58.158
<i>I can't wait to come home
and squeeze you.</i>

30:58.292 --> 31:00.227
<i>I... Whoop, ha!</i>

31:00.361 --> 31:03.063
<i>I already have so many things
to give you.</i>

31:03.197 --> 31:05.866
<i>And you're going to love them.</i>

31:05.999 --> 31:07.635
<i>Bye, angel.</i>

31:07.769 --> 31:08.969
<i>Mama loves you.</i>

32:21.910 --> 32:24.478
<i>My name is Lorna Moody.</i>

32:24.612 --> 32:27.582
<i>I'm known as an exit guide.</i>

32:27.715 --> 32:30.117
<i>I sit with people
who've made the decision</i>

32:30.250 --> 32:33.120
<i>to end their lives
on their own terms.</i>

32:35.055 --> 32:36.758
<i>I want to start
by answering</i>

32:36.891 --> 32:39.159
<i>any questions
you might have for me.</i>

32:39.293 --> 32:41.796
<i>How long will
it take her to die?</i>

32:41.930 --> 32:45.533
<i>Our preferred method is a gas</i>

32:45.667 --> 32:48.636
<i>that requires
the use of a hood.</i>

32:48.770 --> 32:52.707
<i>Once she pulls the hood
down over her head,</i>

32:52.841 --> 32:57.311
<i>she'll be unconscious
in five to 10 seconds.</i>

32:57.444 --> 32:59.112
<i>That's all she'll know.</i>

33:00.414 --> 33:02.684
How many times
have you done this?

33:02.817 --> 33:05.118
I've been
a compassionate presence

33:05.252 --> 33:07.488
at the bedside of 44 people.

33:09.824 --> 33:12.459
Tell me about your wife.

33:12.594 --> 33:16.798
We found out
she was sick last year.

33:19.767 --> 33:22.269
She was pretty far gone...

33:23.671 --> 33:26.206
by the time we realized.

33:27.609 --> 33:31.144
So we moved here...

33:31.278 --> 33:33.848
so she could be closer
to her doctors.

33:36.149 --> 33:38.151
But after the move,

33:38.285 --> 33:40.220
she started getting worse.

33:40.354 --> 33:42.356
I'm so sorry.

33:42.489 --> 33:44.191
I'm glad you called.

33:45.827 --> 33:47.896
Hopefully, I can help.

33:49.831 --> 33:51.933
I hope so.

33:52.065 --> 33:55.202
Mr. Matheson,
I need to warn you.

33:56.738 --> 33:59.072
For anyone to do this,

33:59.206 --> 34:02.209
they must be mentally competent

34:02.342 --> 34:06.014
and physically able to
carry it through themselves.

34:07.314 --> 34:10.150
Is that clear?
Do you understand?

34:10.284 --> 34:12.587
Yeah. Mm-hm.

34:16.223 --> 34:19.426
Shall we go see your wife? Hm?

34:21.896 --> 34:26.034
Mrs. Matheson,
my name is Lorna Moody.

34:26.166 --> 34:27.902
Do you know why I'm here?

34:31.940 --> 34:34.876
Your husband told me
about your condition,

34:35.009 --> 34:37.144
and I'm here to see
if I can help.

34:39.914 --> 34:41.649
Mrs. Matheson,
are you all right?

34:44.117 --> 34:45.620
Peekaboo!

34:48.556 --> 34:50.625
Who are you playing with?

34:53.226 --> 34:54.662
My friend.

34:56.931 --> 34:59.499
And what's your friend's name?

35:01.703 --> 35:03.270
Melinda.

35:05.272 --> 35:06.473
Melinda?

35:07.942 --> 35:10.078
Is she here with us now?

35:23.925 --> 35:26.995
- Please, I haven't said...
- Mr. Matheson.

35:27.127 --> 35:29.731
I was quite clear
on the requirements,

35:29.864 --> 35:31.599
and I'm truly, deeply sorry,

35:31.733 --> 35:35.435
but your wife is no longer
mentally competent.

35:35.570 --> 35:37.605
Please.

35:37.739 --> 35:40.207
You can't just leave.

35:40.340 --> 35:41.976
I am deeply sorry

35:42.110 --> 35:44.779
for everything you and
your wife have been through...

35:46.279 --> 35:48.516
but you misrepresented
her condition.

35:48.650 --> 35:52.120
What am I supposed to do?

35:52.252 --> 35:54.656
I would still like
to stay a few days,

35:54.789 --> 35:56.323
if that's all right with you.

35:56.456 --> 35:59.694
I may not be able to help
in the way that you wanted,

35:59.827 --> 36:03.230
but at least I could provide
some support, no matter what.

36:03.363 --> 36:04.766
Is that okay with you?

36:04.899 --> 36:07.935
So, what do you like to do
at the playground?

36:08.069 --> 36:09.637
Because I like the swings.

36:10.905 --> 36:13.373
We can swing, swing.

36:16.577 --> 36:17.812
Thank you.

36:20.347 --> 36:22.517
Thank you.

36:36.731 --> 36:39.100
I made up
the guest room for you.

36:42.804 --> 36:44.739
We don't get much company.

36:44.872 --> 36:46.874
Oh, it's lovely.

36:47.008 --> 36:51.079
All right, well, I have to run
to the store for some dinner.

36:51.211 --> 36:54.182
Oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

36:54.314 --> 36:56.084
Not much in the kitchen either.

36:56.216 --> 36:59.187
Well, let me go.
It's the least I can do.

38:06.754 --> 38:07.922
Oh!

38:43.291 --> 38:44.559
Hello.

38:46.627 --> 38:47.562
Excuse me.

38:49.697 --> 38:51.398
Excuse me, sir.

39:00.440 --> 39:01.976
Mr. Matheson.

39:02.109 --> 39:05.546
There's a strange man
standing on your front lawn.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.415
I think there's
something wrong with him.

39:20.828 --> 39:22.296
<i>Hello?</i>

39:23.798 --> 39:25.199
He's here again.

39:25.333 --> 39:26.834
- <i>My partner?</i>
- Yeah.

39:26.968 --> 39:28.903
<i>I'm sorry.
I'll be right there.</i>

39:29.036 --> 39:30.872
Yeah. Okay.

39:31.005 --> 39:32.340
See you soon.

39:35.309 --> 39:36.677
Who is he?

39:41.148 --> 39:42.550
He's a cop.

39:42.683 --> 39:43.784
What's he doing?

39:45.887 --> 39:50.791
Who knows?
He worked a case here before we moved in.

39:50.925 --> 39:53.060
Now he won't leave us alone.

39:54.394 --> 39:55.863
A case?

39:57.064 --> 39:59.100
I hope it wasn't a murder.

40:04.538 --> 40:06.741
Oh, God. It was, wasn't it?

40:17.718 --> 40:19.253
You gotta stop it
with this shit.

40:19.387 --> 40:21.289
What's the matter with you?

40:21.421 --> 40:23.591
Does your wife know
what's going on?

40:24.926 --> 40:26.861
You're driving yourself crazy.

40:26.994 --> 40:29.429
You need to leave
that family alone.

40:31.431 --> 40:34.702
I'm sorry I've ever
said anything, man.

40:37.405 --> 40:38.739
Just...

40:38.873 --> 40:40.741
think about your family.

40:45.413 --> 40:48.182
No! No, no, no! Why?

41:07.301 --> 41:08.502
Frank.

41:13.641 --> 41:15.810
Frank, stop.

41:35.763 --> 41:38.699
Hi. This is
Detective Muldoon, 45632.

41:38.833 --> 41:41.602
I'm just trying to get a 20
on a Detective Wilson,

41:41.736 --> 41:44.005
who also used to work
at the 51.

41:47.375 --> 41:49.643
Yeah. Just one second.

41:51.979 --> 41:54.382
All right, ahem.

41:54.515 --> 41:57.018
Saint Gideon's.

41:57.151 --> 41:59.553
Isn't that
the psychiatric hospital?

42:05.860 --> 42:07.495
All right. Thank you.

42:19.306 --> 42:20.808
Frank.

42:59.613 --> 43:02.083
Hi. I'm here to see
Detective Wilson.

43:04.185 --> 43:06.287
Down the hall, to the right.

43:06.420 --> 43:08.122
Already restrained.

43:51.632 --> 43:52.867
Detective Wilson?

43:55.402 --> 43:57.338
I'm Detective Muldoon.

43:57.471 --> 44:01.442
The doctor said that she told
you I was gonna come see you.

44:01.576 --> 44:03.545
Did you find my tapes?

44:03.677 --> 44:06.046
Uh, your tapes, sir?

44:06.180 --> 44:08.115
Mm.

44:17.825 --> 44:19.561
I came to ask you
some questions

44:19.693 --> 44:22.029
about a case that you worked
two years ago.

44:25.166 --> 44:27.368
What can you tell me
about the Landers family?

44:27.502 --> 44:29.303
It's happening again,
isn't it?

44:32.139 --> 44:35.376
Once you step into the place
where they died,

44:35.510 --> 44:38.012
it never lets you go.

44:38.145 --> 44:40.214
This is never gonna end.

44:40.347 --> 44:42.283
What will never end?

44:42.416 --> 44:44.151
That house's grudge.

44:49.658 --> 44:51.158
There she is.

44:53.694 --> 44:57.731
You went into the Landers'
house, didn't you?

44:57.865 --> 45:02.369
If you haven't started seeing
them yet, don't worry.

45:03.672 --> 45:04.772
You will.

45:06.675 --> 45:08.742
Maybe we should
tear our eyes out

45:08.876 --> 45:12.012
so that we can't
see them anymore.

45:13.981 --> 45:15.015
No!

45:15.149 --> 45:16.685
It's the house!

45:16.817 --> 45:18.452
You gotta burn it down!

45:18.587 --> 45:20.589
Ahh! Burn it to the ground!

45:20.721 --> 45:22.389
Wait. Kill me.

45:22.524 --> 45:24.725
Kill me! Kill me!

45:44.345 --> 45:46.380
Guys, he's losing blood fast!

45:46.514 --> 45:49.618
I can still feel them
watching me!

45:49.750 --> 45:52.953
I can still
feel them watching me!

46:12.406 --> 46:15.744
<i>I can't stop
thinking about the Landers' murder.</i>

46:15.876 --> 46:18.479
<i>What the hell happened
in that house?</i>

46:18.613 --> 46:20.281
Who does that
to a 6-year-old girl?

46:20.414 --> 46:23.984
Nobody does that to
a 6-year-old girl. A monster.

46:24.118 --> 46:25.819
<i>Now, ever since I went
to that house,</i>

46:25.953 --> 46:27.821
<i>I've been seeing shit.</i>

46:27.955 --> 46:30.190
<i>I can't get it out of my head.</i>

46:30.324 --> 46:32.993
<i>There's a case I found
in Japan.</i>

46:33.127 --> 46:34.729
<i>At least a dozen
unrelated people</i>

46:34.862 --> 46:37.431
<i>killed in the same house
in Tokyo.</i>

46:37.565 --> 46:40.769
<i>And I spoke to the detective
over there, this Nakagawa.</i>

46:40.901 --> 46:42.637
<i>He thinks a murder
in that house</i>

46:42.771 --> 46:44.838
<i>caused something</i>
<i>called a</i> Ju-On.

46:45.873 --> 46:47.642
Something like a curse.

46:47.776 --> 46:50.811
<i>Fiona Landers worked
at that same house in Tokyo,</i>

46:50.944 --> 46:52.647
<i>and I know this sounds crazy.</i>

46:54.081 --> 46:55.816
<i>I think Fiona Landers</i>

46:55.949 --> 46:58.819
<i>brought this curse
back with her from Japan.</i>

46:58.952 --> 47:00.821
<i>And it made her
kill her family.</i>

47:10.164 --> 47:12.066
- Where is he?
- Where do you think?

47:24.278 --> 47:28.415
All right, all right. Focus.
Just focus. Just focus.

47:30.451 --> 47:32.953
That's what she said
when we started.

47:33.087 --> 47:34.355
- Hey.
- When we first started,

47:34.488 --> 47:36.290
it was at the beginning.
I know it was.

47:40.294 --> 47:43.531
<i>The Landers, the real
estate agents, that thing in Japan,</i>

47:43.665 --> 47:45.232
they're connected,
I'm telling you.

47:45.366 --> 47:46.900
You gotta trust me.

47:48.803 --> 47:51.506
When was the last time
you ate?

47:51.639 --> 47:54.576
- You look like shit.
- It's the case.

47:54.709 --> 47:56.544
The case is cold.

47:56.678 --> 47:58.412
Don't give me that shit.

47:58.546 --> 48:00.347
You know something
awful's going on.

48:00.481 --> 48:02.182
I get it.

48:02.316 --> 48:03.518
I do.

48:05.886 --> 48:08.088
And I wish I knew
how to help you.

48:10.457 --> 48:13.427
Just, you know,
take some time off.

48:13.561 --> 48:16.564
Spend some time with
the girls.

48:16.698 --> 48:18.932
And then maybe it'll stop.

48:20.502 --> 48:22.302
They're never gonna stop.

48:24.371 --> 48:25.272
Never.

48:27.341 --> 48:29.243
It's Fiona Landers.

48:29.376 --> 48:31.746
She's the one
who's been doing this.

48:35.817 --> 48:37.719
Let's get out of here.

48:45.760 --> 48:46.895
Come on.

49:13.721 --> 49:15.088
You good?

49:15.222 --> 49:17.024
Yeah. Yeah.

49:19.993 --> 49:22.129
- Ahh!
- What? Stop it.

49:22.262 --> 49:24.965
- Oh, God! Ahh!
- What? Stop it!

49:25.098 --> 49:27.702
- No! Stop it! Wilson! Wilson!
- Fucker! No! Stop her!

51:13.575 --> 51:15.743
Fuck.

53:13.628 --> 53:16.564
- Oh, Jesus.
- The fuck are you doing?

53:16.698 --> 53:18.099
Sam Landers is here.

53:18.231 --> 53:20.535
- What are you talking about?
- He's in the building.

53:20.668 --> 53:23.571
- Sam Landers is dead.
- Come on. He's on the tape.

54:03.211 --> 54:04.411
Don't you have a kid?

54:06.814 --> 54:07.949
Go home.

54:09.016 --> 54:10.585
And get some sleep.

54:13.020 --> 54:14.254
You're losing it.

54:54.294 --> 54:57.899
Hi. The sitter
canceled on me, so, uh...

54:58.032 --> 55:00.467
I couldn't find anybody
at short notice.

55:00.601 --> 55:02.170
Sit down.

55:02.302 --> 55:04.972
Relax. You can read this.
It's kind of...

55:05.106 --> 55:06.974
Oh, no, no, no. Right there.

55:13.281 --> 55:16.316
Hey. It's okay. Relax.

55:16.449 --> 55:18.653
The kid and I will find
something to do, okay?

55:20.655 --> 55:24.225
- Come on, buddy. Come with me.
- Yeah? Yeah, you can go.

55:30.463 --> 55:31.532
Okay.

55:31.666 --> 55:33.167
What do we have here?

55:35.870 --> 55:37.538
I think you can watch this.

56:32.425 --> 56:33.628
Hello?

56:39.834 --> 56:41.035
Hello?

57:31.552 --> 57:32.753
Hi.

57:32.887 --> 57:35.022
Hi. Where are you?

57:35.156 --> 57:36.456
I'm still at the house.

57:36.590 --> 57:38.626
What time do you think
you'll be home?

57:38.759 --> 57:41.195
Uh, I don't know.

57:41.329 --> 57:42.797
I can't leave her by herself.

57:42.930 --> 57:44.832
<i>Do you think
you should call the police?</i>

57:46.267 --> 57:48.135
- What's the matter?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

57:48.269 --> 57:49.303
The, uh...

57:51.305 --> 57:53.274
The baby just moved.

57:53.407 --> 57:55.409
How are you feeling
about everything?

57:57.111 --> 57:58.946
<i>I'm sorry.
It's not a good time, I know.</i>

57:59.080 --> 58:01.749
No, no, no, it's okay. Um...

58:02.950 --> 58:04.418
I... I wanna talk about it.

58:07.555 --> 58:09.824
Peter, I never wanted
to be a mother.

58:13.427 --> 58:15.429
But I love this baby,

58:15.563 --> 58:18.666
like, so much more
than I thought I did, and...

58:18.799 --> 58:20.868
I don't know, I...

58:21.002 --> 58:23.671
I'm gonna love this baby,
no matter what.

58:34.348 --> 58:35.549
Peter, are you there?

58:37.685 --> 58:39.220
Yeah, I'm still here.

58:43.624 --> 58:45.359
I'm just really, really happy.

58:51.999 --> 58:54.335
<i>Was that the doorbell?</i>

58:54.468 --> 58:57.638
Uh, let me see who it is.
I'll call you right back, okay?

58:59.607 --> 59:01.342
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

59:02.877 --> 59:04.478
Yeah, I love you too.

59:51.125 --> 59:52.226
Melinda?

1:00:02.269 --> 1:00:03.437
Melinda?

1:00:10.945 --> 1:00:12.113
Melinda?

1:00:41.342 --> 1:00:43.043
Melinda, sweetheart,
is that you?

1:00:47.848 --> 1:00:48.983
Melinda?

1:00:50.184 --> 1:00:51.385
You okay?

1:02:59.380 --> 1:03:00.814
Hi.

1:03:05.052 --> 1:03:06.487
Hello?

1:03:11.058 --> 1:03:12.159
Peter.

1:03:19.366 --> 1:03:20.635
Peter.

1:03:34.915 --> 1:03:36.283
Peter?

1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:47.461
Peter.

1:03:52.833 --> 1:03:54.803
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1:03:57.706 --> 1:03:59.139
You scared me.

1:04:00.274 --> 1:04:02.409
The parents finally came home?

1:04:07.114 --> 1:04:08.849
Hey, what's wrong?

1:04:11.952 --> 1:04:13.688
What are you doing?

1:04:22.530 --> 1:04:24.331
What is wrong with you?

1:05:00.568 --> 1:05:03.470
Here. You look beautiful.

1:05:06.508 --> 1:05:08.810
How about some pear?

1:05:08.942 --> 1:05:10.043
Hm?

1:05:10.177 --> 1:05:11.546
Pear?

1:05:11.679 --> 1:05:14.582
Oh, yeah, we like pear,
don't we?

1:05:14.716 --> 1:05:15.916
Mm.

1:05:16.718 --> 1:05:18.352
Oh, yeah. This.

1:05:20.220 --> 1:05:23.090
How long have you been married?

1:05:23.223 --> 1:05:25.760
Fifty years, next month.

1:05:25.894 --> 1:05:27.762
Oh.

1:05:27.896 --> 1:05:29.631
Mm.

1:05:29.764 --> 1:05:31.932
Fifty beautiful years.

1:05:54.488 --> 1:05:57.491
You're such a good girl.

1:05:57.625 --> 1:05:59.993
You're gonna be so happy.

1:06:39.801 --> 1:06:41.268
Mrs. Matheson.

1:06:52.514 --> 1:06:54.749
Mrs. Matheson?

1:06:59.954 --> 1:07:01.221
Mrs. Matheson.

1:07:05.693 --> 1:07:07.394
Mrs. Math...

1:07:10.999 --> 1:07:13.333
Hey, hey. What's wrong?

1:07:14.969 --> 1:07:16.838
What happened?

1:07:16.971 --> 1:07:18.338
What's the matter?

1:07:31.285 --> 1:07:36.824
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but I believe...

1:07:36.958 --> 1:07:38.660
your house...

1:07:38.793 --> 1:07:40.562
is haunted.

1:07:42.797 --> 1:07:46.233
I thought someone like you...

1:07:46.366 --> 1:07:49.102
might understand our unique...

1:07:50.237 --> 1:07:51.906
situation.

1:07:53.841 --> 1:07:57.210
Wh...? You mean,
you've seen her too?

1:07:57.344 --> 1:07:58.713
Mm-hm.

1:08:00.048 --> 1:08:02.416
Seeing them...

1:08:02.550 --> 1:08:08.288
it gives me hope that maybe
she might be around too.

1:08:08.422 --> 1:08:10.390
After it's over.

1:08:15.429 --> 1:08:17.230
You see, I think,

1:08:17.364 --> 1:08:19.934
<i>with places like this,</i>

1:08:20.068 --> 1:08:24.939
<i>it feels like the walls
between this world</i>

1:08:25.073 --> 1:08:28.442
<i>and the next
have been torn down.</i>

1:08:30.044 --> 1:08:33.313
<i>Time acts differently here.</i>

1:08:36.183 --> 1:08:39.654
<i>Anyone who has entered here</i>

1:08:39.787 --> 1:08:43.791
<i>and anyone who will enter here,</i>

1:08:43.925 --> 1:08:47.795
<i>we're all bound together.</i>

1:08:47.929 --> 1:08:50.098
When Faith goes,

1:08:50.230 --> 1:08:53.701
this place
will let us stay together.

1:08:53.835 --> 1:08:57.105
It's the only hope
that we have.

1:09:22.096 --> 1:09:23.865
Mr. Matheson?

1:09:30.470 --> 1:09:32.607
Mrs. Matheson?

1:09:32.740 --> 1:09:35.342
I'm so happy to see you
on your feet.

1:09:37.745 --> 1:09:39.614
Mrs. Matheson.

1:09:44.351 --> 1:09:46.154
Mrs. Matheson.

1:09:49.356 --> 1:09:53.161
What have you done?
What did you do?

1:09:58.198 --> 1:10:00.001
He wanted to kill me.

1:11:22.282 --> 1:11:24.585
How does something
like this even happen?

1:11:37.364 --> 1:11:39.267
Hey.

1:11:39.399 --> 1:11:41.401
Did you get any word
on that body we found?

1:11:41.536 --> 1:11:45.006
- The feds took over last night.
- Wait.

1:11:47.241 --> 1:11:48.976
What about interviewing
Mrs. Matheson?

1:11:49.110 --> 1:11:51.344
There's nothing I could do.

1:11:51.478 --> 1:11:53.781
What about the house,
did they follow up on that?

1:11:53.915 --> 1:11:55.482
It doesn't seem like it.

1:11:55.616 --> 1:11:57.051
Shit like this always happens

1:11:57.185 --> 1:11:58.886
when we turn it over
to the feds.

1:11:59.020 --> 1:12:00.387
Don't worry about it.

1:12:00.521 --> 1:12:02.690
I'm sure they'll send someone
by the next few days.

1:12:02.824 --> 1:12:04.892
- Next few days?
- Yeah.

1:12:07.795 --> 1:12:10.698
We found a fucking body
and another one in the house.

1:12:10.832 --> 1:12:12.332
How many more
do we have to find?

1:12:12.465 --> 1:12:15.303
Ah! Jesus, just drop it.

1:12:17.205 --> 1:12:19.472
It's not our case anymore.
Seriously.

1:12:41.262 --> 1:12:44.065
- Good morning, Mrs. Matheson.
- Morning.

1:12:44.198 --> 1:12:46.334
How you doing,
Mrs. Matheson?

1:13:07.755 --> 1:13:09.056
Thank you.

1:13:43.224 --> 1:13:45.893
Oh, my God.
Someone get help!

1:13:46.027 --> 1:13:47.295
Go. Go!

1:13:49.429 --> 1:13:51.933
<i>Hi,
you've reached the Muldoons.</i>

1:13:52.066 --> 1:13:53.801
<i>We can't come
to the phone right now,</i>

1:13:53.935 --> 1:13:57.038
<i>but you can leave us
a message after the beep.</i>

1:13:58.506 --> 1:14:00.975
Hey. It's me.

1:14:01.108 --> 1:14:03.844
<i>I thought you should know
that the hospital called.</i>

1:14:03.978 --> 1:14:05.780
<i>Faith Matheson's dead.</i>

1:14:07.548 --> 1:14:10.751
<i>Okay. Um, call me
when you get this.</i>

1:14:17.457 --> 1:14:18.993
<i>It's the house!</i>

1:14:19.126 --> 1:14:21.095
<i>You gotta burn it down!</i>

1:14:21.228 --> 1:14:22.997
This is never gonna end.

1:14:23.130 --> 1:14:24.497
What will never end?

1:14:24.632 --> 1:14:26.801
That house's grudge.

1:14:26.934 --> 1:14:29.637
<i>Burn it to the ground!</i>

1:14:50.490 --> 1:14:51.826
Burke?

1:15:29.797 --> 1:15:31.932
<i>Why did he kill them?
Did he say?</i>

1:15:32.066 --> 1:15:34.468
<i>There's
someone not at rest here.</i>

1:15:34.602 --> 1:15:36.670
<i>A little girl, I think.</i>

1:15:36.804 --> 1:15:39.173
<i>I've spent my life
trying to communicate</i>

1:15:39.306 --> 1:15:40.875
<i>with people on the other side.</i>

1:15:41.008 --> 1:15:43.477
<i>And I feel this spirit
so powerfully.</i>

1:15:43.611 --> 1:15:46.080
<i>He claims it was
for the insurance money.</i>

1:15:58.292 --> 1:16:00.094
<i>You will not.</i>

1:16:00.227 --> 1:16:02.096
<i>The dead only want
one thing, Bobby.</i>

1:16:02.229 --> 1:16:04.765
<i>I know.
To go into the light.</i>

1:18:12.159 --> 1:18:13.194
Mom?

1:18:13.327 --> 1:18:15.362
Burke?

1:18:15.496 --> 1:18:16.665
Burke?

1:18:18.999 --> 1:18:20.467
What's going on?

1:18:21.835 --> 1:18:23.037
Baby, come here.

1:18:36.518 --> 1:18:37.586
Mom?

1:18:40.321 --> 1:18:41.656
What's wrong?

1:18:43.891 --> 1:18:45.359
I'm sorry.

1:18:47.461 --> 1:18:49.196
I'm so sorry.

1:18:56.870 --> 1:18:59.206
What do we do
when we're scared?

1:19:06.013 --> 1:19:08.717
We close our eyes,
and we count to five.

1:19:11.185 --> 1:19:12.721
- One...
- One...

1:19:13.921 --> 1:19:15.222
two...

1:19:16.290 --> 1:19:17.291
three...

1:19:18.459 --> 1:19:19.927
four...

1:19:21.028 --> 1:19:22.631
five.

1:19:25.099 --> 1:19:27.602
See? Everything's fine.

1:19:35.476 --> 1:19:38.245
- Goodman.
- <i>It's Muldoon.</i>

1:19:38.379 --> 1:19:40.147
<i>Can you come over?</i>

1:19:40.281 --> 1:19:41.849
<i>I need to talk.</i>

1:19:46.621 --> 1:19:48.989
I didn't know
anyone else to call.

1:19:49.123 --> 1:19:50.791
This is not
your case.

1:19:52.126 --> 1:19:54.328
You have no business
going into this.

1:19:54.461 --> 1:19:55.697
But I did.

1:19:57.064 --> 1:19:59.701
Was this happening
at all...

1:19:59.833 --> 1:20:01.503
before
you went to the house?

1:20:01.636 --> 1:20:03.037
I don't know.

1:20:06.473 --> 1:20:08.142
And, uh...

1:20:08.275 --> 1:20:11.211
now, when I'm closing my eyes,
I can see them.

1:20:13.280 --> 1:20:16.283
Whatever happened to Wilson
is happening to me.

1:20:20.622 --> 1:20:21.989
And I'm scared.

1:20:23.424 --> 1:20:26.160
I can't end up like him.

1:20:26.293 --> 1:20:28.862
I'm afraid it's gonna
make me hurt my son.

1:20:49.083 --> 1:20:51.285
Where are we going?

1:20:51.418 --> 1:20:55.189
I have to try to stop this.
I need to keep you safe.

1:21:10.170 --> 1:21:12.540
Whatever happens, do not
get out of this car, okay?

1:21:12.674 --> 1:21:14.542
Do not open this door.

1:21:14.676 --> 1:21:15.943
Do you understand?

1:21:16.076 --> 1:21:17.444
Promise me?

1:21:17.579 --> 1:21:18.680
I promise.

1:21:18.813 --> 1:21:20.214
I love you so much.

1:21:37.030 --> 1:21:38.566
I wanna show you something.

1:21:42.069 --> 1:21:44.972
How could you do that?

1:22:06.628 --> 1:22:09.163
<i>I wanna show you something.</i>

1:22:24.445 --> 1:22:25.914
<i>Melinda?</i>

1:22:26.046 --> 1:22:27.948
<i>I wanna show you something.</i>

1:22:54.809 --> 1:22:56.678
<i>I wanna show you something.</i>

1:23:22.504 --> 1:23:24.204
Mom?

1:23:24.338 --> 1:23:25.907
What are you doing?

1:23:28.710 --> 1:23:31.913
Burke,
I told you to stay in the car.

1:23:32.045 --> 1:23:33.882
Mommy, please don't do this.

1:23:34.014 --> 1:23:35.717
Get back in the car now.

1:23:35.850 --> 1:23:37.484
I don't
understand.

1:23:37.619 --> 1:23:40.020
Why are you doing this?
I'm scared.

1:23:44.626 --> 1:23:46.661
What do we do
when we're scared?

1:23:58.472 --> 1:24:01.174
What do we do
when we're scared, Burke?

1:24:08.415 --> 1:24:10.585
What do we do
when we're scared?

1:24:16.991 --> 1:24:18.927
Close our eyes...

1:24:22.830 --> 1:24:24.566
...and count to five.

1:24:25.633 --> 1:24:26.534
One...

1:24:32.740 --> 1:24:34.074
two...

1:24:34.207 --> 1:24:35.944
What have you done?

1:24:37.377 --> 1:24:38.546
- ...three...
- ...three...

1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:42.016
I can still feel them
watching me!

1:24:42.149 --> 1:24:43.183
- ...four...
- ...four...

1:24:53.828 --> 1:24:55.563
five.

1:25:29.831 --> 1:25:31.465
I love you so much.

1:26:27.855 --> 1:26:29.791
Burke, bus is here!

1:26:36.430 --> 1:26:38.032
Have a good day at school, bud.

1:26:38.166 --> 1:26:39.399
Come here.

1:26:40.467 --> 1:26:42.469
Mommy's gonna be okay.

1:26:42.603 --> 1:26:44.471
We're both gonna be okay.

1:26:46.507 --> 1:26:48.576
And I love you so much.

1:26:48.710 --> 1:26:50.310
So much.

1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:54.682
I'm going to school, Mom!
