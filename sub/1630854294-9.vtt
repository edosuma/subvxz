WEBVTT

00:10.333 --> 00:11.767
Did you bring a gold pan?

00:11.767 --> 00:13.433
I got mine, where's yours?

00:13.433 --> 00:14.734
Can I use that one?

00:14.734 --> 00:16.066
- Nope.
- Okay.

00:17.367 --> 00:20.367
So, this is the road that
we never mined.

00:20.367 --> 00:22.066
- Yeah.
- Like, it starts back there.

00:23.433 --> 00:27.200
It's built on top of
tailings from like, the 90s.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.033
It's virgin underneath.

00:29.033 --> 00:32.033
- Do you wanna pan the road?
- Yeah, why not?

00:32.033 --> 00:35.033
My water license in
the Yukon's expiring.

00:35.033 --> 00:38.400
So, if we don't start working
on it now, then we never will.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.266
In the Yukon,
with the clock ticking,

00:41.266 --> 00:45.934
Parker Schnabel is determined
to get every ounce
of gold he can,

00:45.934 --> 00:48.000
before the end of the season.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.300
Rule number one
with panning, Tyler.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.567
- Yeah?
- What is it?

00:51.567 --> 00:54.567
Um... clean water?

00:54.567 --> 00:57.133
No. Make sure there's
nothing in the pan already.

00:57.133 --> 00:59.433
Oh, okay. Yep.
Didn't know that.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.133
You've panned before?

01:02.133 --> 01:04.467
Everyone I've learned
off has a different like,
method of doing it.

01:04.467 --> 01:06.400
There's no right
or wrong.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.300
I mean, there is.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.767
I'm
not comfortable.

01:11.767 --> 01:14.300
- Maybe I'll walk into
the water.
- Yeah, go ahead.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.467
- That's how the real miners
used to do it.
- Okay.

01:17.467 --> 01:19.834
- Are you [bleep] with me?
- No!

01:19.834 --> 01:21.266
Oh, that's actually
much better.

01:23.634 --> 01:25.100
You just gotta
get aggressive with it.

01:26.033 --> 01:27.834
- Like this?
- Yeah.

01:27.834 --> 01:29.000
How do I get
all of them out?

01:30.700 --> 01:32.433
When you want
material to go out of the pan,

01:32.433 --> 01:34.634
you like, angle it like this
and wash it out.

01:34.634 --> 01:36.800
You don't wanna really
throw it out. You know
what I mean?

01:36.800 --> 01:41.066
- Oh!
- And any gold starts to
show up down at the bottom.

01:41.066 --> 01:42.667
- Oh, is that a bit
of gold?
- Yeah.

01:42.667 --> 01:45.300
Oh, cool!
There's color.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.533
- Okay.
- That's good enough
for me.

01:48.533 --> 01:50.533
What are you doing, man?
I saw your truck on the road.

01:50.533 --> 01:52.233
I didn't know if you were
broke down or something.

01:52.233 --> 01:54.967
There's always a fair chance
of that.

01:54.967 --> 01:57.000
What are you finding?

01:57.000 --> 02:00.433
We're just panning this road.
Every year I've driven by it,
I've been like,

02:00.433 --> 02:02.667
"Should we mine that? No."

02:02.667 --> 02:05.100
But now it's the last year
that we can't say no anymore.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.400
If we say no this year, then
it's never gonna get mined.

02:12.634 --> 02:14.767
This has been left because,
well, it's the only section
of road.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.600
There's no other way around it
right through here.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.133
We got so many other things
going on.

02:20.133 --> 02:23.367
But the stripping
crew has a little opening,
don't it?

02:25.800 --> 02:29.266
- I mean...
- Let's just send them in here
and see what happens.

02:32.300 --> 02:36.867
This is not just mining
the road, it's building
a new road,

02:36.867 --> 02:40.333
then, it's coming down here,
stripping this.

02:40.333 --> 02:42.200
I'm just looking at what
we got going on down there.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.700
Everything's froze up.

02:43.700 --> 02:46.867
I feel like, everyday we are
a little bit further behind.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.500
I think it's gonna
be thawed.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.333
Like, the sides have
been exposed.

02:50.333 --> 02:53.367
Like, I don't even
think that the pay's gonna
be frozen.

02:53.367 --> 02:54.967
If it's thawed,
that's gonna be huge.

02:54.967 --> 02:58.266
If it's not, then I'm gonna
eat a big dose of crow, Mitch.

03:00.734 --> 03:02.900
I'm not trying to mess up
your schedule.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.100
But I am.

03:06.233 --> 03:10.867
Parker just added a huge
amount of work to our
already overloaded schedule.

03:10.867 --> 03:13.066
There's already not enough
hours in the day,

03:13.066 --> 03:14.900
and days left in this season,

03:14.900 --> 03:16.567
to get through what we've
got going on.

03:16.567 --> 03:18.300
And for Parker to wanna come
down here

03:18.300 --> 03:21.200
and pull out the only road,
the only access we have

03:21.200 --> 03:22.767
down to where we're
currently working,

03:22.767 --> 03:24.934
to start another cut,
I think is crazy.

03:43.200 --> 03:46.200
Big thing for me is,
I really like to
push ourselves

03:46.200 --> 03:47.734
and find more gold each year.

03:47.734 --> 03:50.667
And we know this is our last
season to mine this stuff.

03:50.667 --> 03:53.300
Nine weeks
into this season,

03:53.300 --> 03:57.266
27-year old Parker Schnabel's
master plan

03:57.266 --> 03:59.166
is starting to come together.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.567
We're stretched
really thin right now.

04:01.567 --> 04:04.133
It's a good thing we've got
a good group of people
this year because

04:04.133 --> 04:07.634
it's a lot going on,
especially with Alaska
firing up.

04:07.634 --> 04:13.100
In three weeks,
Parker will open a new
operation in Alaska.

04:13.100 --> 04:17.300
In the Yukon, his two
wash plants are running
side by side

04:17.300 --> 04:18.467
in the Bear cut,

04:18.467 --> 04:22.266
and have delivered more than
1,800 ounces of gold.

04:22.266 --> 04:24.233
We're more than halfway
through the ground.

04:24.233 --> 04:26.567
Nearly four million
square feet.

04:26.567 --> 04:31.567
Now, our whole season depends
on keeping two plants running
as long as possible.

04:31.567 --> 04:35.033
His crew have
already stripped 48 acres,

04:35.033 --> 04:39.667
36 football fields,
of the massive
90-acre airstrip.

04:40.834 --> 04:44.400
Now, Parker has tasked
foreman, Mitch Blaschke

04:44.400 --> 04:47.400
with opening even more ground.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.100
There's a whole bunch of
little pieces of ground
here and there

04:50.100 --> 04:52.400
that could probably make us
a quick buck.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.867
If we don't do it now,
we'll never get to it.

04:55.667 --> 04:58.634
Parker's decided that
he wants us to strip
a new road,

04:58.634 --> 05:01.367
which we're calling
the Panama Canal cut.

05:01.367 --> 05:05.000
Well, we've gotta move the mud
and get down to some
pay gravels.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.567
Over a thousand
yards downstream from
the Bear cut,

05:11.567 --> 05:12.800
and his wash plants,

05:14.033 --> 05:17.433
Mitch must open up
a new ten acre cut,

05:17.433 --> 05:19.767
taking Parker's total
to a hundred.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.433
But to get to the pay,

05:22.433 --> 05:26.367
Mitch must dig up the only
road connecting the camp
to the cuts.

05:27.533 --> 05:29.300
To solve this problem,

05:29.300 --> 05:33.200
Mitch must also build
a new road at the same time,

05:33.200 --> 05:36.500
keeping vital access to
the mine site open.

05:39.967 --> 05:43.500
I got half the crew
working on our new road.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.767
Really important here to have
good roads. We're constantly
moving around.

05:48.233 --> 05:50.400
At the same time we're
building the new road,

05:50.400 --> 05:52.433
we're also stripping this
new cut,

05:52.433 --> 05:53.700
the Panama Canal.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.767
I get why Parker wants
to mine this ground.

06:00.767 --> 06:02.500
But it's just insane.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.233
We need to get this done
super quickly.

06:05.233 --> 06:06.533
It's a huge project.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.033
I think everyone's a little
bit on edge at the moment.

06:11.767 --> 06:14.000
Parker seems to think
that this chunk of ground here

06:14.000 --> 06:15.634
is gonna be some
easy pickings.

06:15.634 --> 06:17.700
We'll find out when
we get to the bottom of it.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.467
It's feeling pretty hard here.

06:21.467 --> 06:23.166
Put the ripper in and see
what we got.

06:23.166 --> 06:26.100
Hopefully, it's just
compact from everybody
driving on it.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.333
I know what that is.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.967
Well, so much for it
being thawed.

06:45.533 --> 06:47.166
It's big, frozen chunks.

06:48.433 --> 06:50.100
Lots of ice in it.

06:50.100 --> 06:53.266
All this rock is glued
together, pretty much.

06:53.266 --> 06:57.033
Parker thought with there
being cuts on both sides
of this,

06:57.033 --> 07:00.467
that this section of the road
would be all thawed out here.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.100
But you see all this water,

07:02.934 --> 07:04.800
you see all this ice here?

07:04.800 --> 07:07.800
You know, if this was
all thawed, all this would've
just drained off

07:07.800 --> 07:09.233
down on both sides here.

07:10.834 --> 07:13.567
We've chopped off our access
to the wash plants.

07:13.567 --> 07:17.000
And we got paydirt and it
looks like it's all gonna
be frozen.

07:27.133 --> 07:29.000
Dirt Devil's
fired up.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.233
We're currently mining
the Aspen.

07:31.233 --> 07:35.066
Squeaking every little ounce
out of it we can.

07:35.066 --> 07:39.233
The Claytons are
chasing gold hotspots
along the creek

07:39.233 --> 07:41.667
on their way to Golden Acres.

07:41.667 --> 07:44.300
We got a long ways
to go and a lot of dirt
to move.

07:44.300 --> 07:47.734
The gold's getting better,
the plan is going great.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.467
We're one step closer
to Golden Acres.

07:50.467 --> 07:51.800
That's where we wanna be.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.100
That's the best shot
on getting 500 ounces.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.800
We're just hoping
for the best.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.133
The "best" is definitely
kicking Fred's ass.

07:59.133 --> 08:03.133
Across the creek,
veteran Green Beret,
Fred Lewis,

08:03.133 --> 08:06.500
is also chasing 500 ounces.

08:06.500 --> 08:10.634
He's finally sluicing pay
from last season's cut

08:10.634 --> 08:14.934
and looking to deliver his
first gold weigh at the end
of the week.

08:14.934 --> 08:16.333
It's been a hell of
a season so far.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.900
You know, we've been fighting
and fighting.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.333
We haven't got any gold yet.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.967
But I know we're almost there.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.333
I heard form Tony that
the road ban was lifted.

08:23.333 --> 08:24.867
Finally gonna get that
dozer in here.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.567
Eight weeks ago,

08:27.567 --> 08:31.100
Fred bought a dozer to
dig his way to a gold bonanza

08:31.100 --> 08:33.300
at the Freedom cut.

08:33.300 --> 08:38.934
But winter road bans
have made delivery of
the 53 ton machine impossible.

08:39.567 --> 08:40.634
Until today.

08:41.867 --> 08:43.634
With that dozer,
we're gonna be able to lift,

08:43.634 --> 08:46.100
move, push a hell of a lot
more paydirt.

08:46.100 --> 08:49.066
And that 500 ounce goal
wouldn't be possible
without it.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.266
Holy [bleep].

08:55.266 --> 08:56.800
That is impressive.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.233
You made it!

08:58.233 --> 09:01.500
So, Mikey, I was hoping,
since you got a lot more
experience than we do,

09:01.500 --> 09:03.266
you could pull this off
the trailer for us

09:03.266 --> 09:04.700
so we don't break it,
pulling it off.

09:04.700 --> 09:07.100
You just rub our bellies
and tell us we're good boys
and we'll...

09:12.533 --> 09:15.867
It's awesome. It's just
anything is better than what
we got going right now. So...

09:15.867 --> 09:17.467
You mean nothing?

09:17.467 --> 09:20.100
Everybody clear?
He's driving ahead.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.734
Oh, [bleep].

09:32.967 --> 09:33.967
Come on, baby.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.600
I got the big haul.
I'll take it off.

09:39.834 --> 09:42.600
It's alive!

09:44.066 --> 09:45.200
What do you think now?

09:45.200 --> 09:47.867
I think it's [bleep] sweet.

09:47.867 --> 09:51.634
This is 1984's best made
freaking dozer.

09:51.634 --> 09:52.467
Damn!

09:53.967 --> 09:56.567
Not gonna lie, she looks a lot
better with the blade on.

09:56.567 --> 09:57.400
Yeah, I bet.

10:00.967 --> 10:04.734
To lift the ten ton
dozer blade off his trailer...

10:04.734 --> 10:07.634
somebody's
chart.

10:07.634 --> 10:10.066
...Mike has to use
the 250 excavator

10:11.200 --> 10:14.867
rated to lift around 10 tons.

10:14.867 --> 10:16.233
All right,
let's get the blade off.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.033
Fingers crossed that
the 250 can lift this.

10:20.033 --> 10:21.033
I think it can.

10:27.934 --> 10:29.433
It barely lifts it.

10:29.433 --> 10:32.000
So, I'm gonna have to be
a little bit ignorant to get
the [bleep] thing off.

10:37.367 --> 10:38.834
- Mike?
- I got it.

10:44.266 --> 10:45.600
Watch out,
watch out, watch out.

10:45.600 --> 10:49.033
Just gotta be very
carful where I go.

10:49.033 --> 10:50.967
Barely lifting it.

10:50.967 --> 10:52.967
You know what that
blade's about to be doing.

10:52.967 --> 10:54.667
- Pushing up the gold.
- Pushing up some gold.

10:58.834 --> 11:01.367
Yeah, that's it.
Got everything off
the trailer.

11:01.367 --> 11:04.400
Mining starts the day
this dozer's running.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.000
- Safe trip!
- Was nice meeting
you all.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.367
Stop for a second, Fred.

11:11.033 --> 11:12.533
Stu, out just a little more.

11:14.533 --> 11:17.800
We've got the beast
all put back together
in the front, plates attached,

11:17.800 --> 11:19.667
hydraulics are going well.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.533
Now, the last thing we
gotta do is put this pin

11:22.533 --> 11:23.934
into our ripper blade.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.133
- Ready?
- Yeah!

11:27.200 --> 11:30.667
- Ready to go to work?
- Let's get this beast working!

11:30.667 --> 11:33.700
Bim, bam, boom,
we're ready to roll.

11:33.700 --> 11:36.667
Fred and his crew
head straight to the claim,

11:36.667 --> 11:39.066
eager to tear open
the Freedom cut.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.900
I can't believe we're actually
gonna start working

11:43.900 --> 11:44.934
on the Freedom cut,

11:44.934 --> 11:46.700
which really is where
we're gonna get our gold.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.100
The past few seasons,
we've kind of had to make do.

11:50.100 --> 11:54.900
This is the first season that
we have the right equipment.

11:54.900 --> 11:58.333
This is what's gonna make us
hit our freaking season goal.

11:58.333 --> 12:00.800
Think how far we've
grown as a team,

12:00.800 --> 12:05.133
coming together and getting
over PTSD and all sort of
the problems that come

12:05.133 --> 12:06.900
with going to war.

12:06.900 --> 12:10.333
And since I've been
here, I don't think about any
of that [bleep], dude.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.967
Just don't have time for it.
I need to look forward.

12:12.967 --> 12:15.000
We have to realize
the opportunity we have.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.400
I mean, we're freaking mining
for gold in Yukon.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.200
The adventure is something
for the rest of our lives.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.000
I mean, the story will be
a hell of a lot better
if we succeed.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.533
- Right?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

12:26.533 --> 12:30.467
Fred and Stu
get back to keeping
the plant fed.

12:30.467 --> 12:33.800
While Buzz rips into
the three acre Freedom cut.

12:37.433 --> 12:39.600
We are firing
on all cylinders.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.467
Everything couldn't be
going any better.

12:42.467 --> 12:45.567
Buzz is up in the Freedom cut,
getting that stripped
and ready.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.467
This dozer is mammoth.

12:48.467 --> 12:51.100
We've named this "the Tank",
and I think you can see why.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.634
It's old but it definitely
does the job.

12:57.634 --> 13:01.233
Really nice stripping
with this machine.

13:01.233 --> 13:05.233
I don't care if it's
got rust on it, I don't care
if it needs a paint job,

13:05.233 --> 13:07.433
its heart is there,
and its soul is there

13:07.433 --> 13:09.100
and this thing is gonna move
a lot of dirt for us.

13:09.934 --> 13:11.333
As long as that
dozer's running,

13:11.333 --> 13:14.367
we really do have
a chance of hitting that
500 ounce goal.

13:14.367 --> 13:16.400
You gotta love it when
a plan comes together.

13:24.533 --> 13:27.233
We are right
where we need to be.

13:27.233 --> 13:29.533
This dozer is an absolute
game changer.

13:30.734 --> 13:34.433
At California
creek, Fred Lewis finally

13:34.433 --> 13:37.166
has the dozer stripping
the Freedom cut.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.533
This dozer can definitely
push dirt.

13:49.533 --> 13:51.300
Fred, you have
a copy on me?

13:51.300 --> 13:54.200
I'm gonna need you to
come down here. Dozer broke.

13:55.867 --> 13:57.734
I just heard that
the dozer's down.

13:57.734 --> 13:59.834
We could be seriously here.

13:59.834 --> 14:01.266
Got a lot riding on this.

14:01.266 --> 14:04.333
I've got my house on this.
I've got all of our financials
into it.

14:04.333 --> 14:07.000
At this point, if the dozer's
down, we're down.

14:07.800 --> 14:08.700
Plain and simple.

14:10.100 --> 14:10.934
All right.

14:15.834 --> 14:18.667
Holy [bleep].

14:18.667 --> 14:20.133
Come up here and
look at this.

14:20.133 --> 14:21.634
I backed up, I stopped,

14:21.634 --> 14:23.934
set the blades down,
that goes chunk.

14:26.667 --> 14:30.066
The little bracket that
holds the round that lifts
the blade up and down

14:30.066 --> 14:33.567
has been cracked for
a long time and finally
decided to let go.

14:33.567 --> 14:36.333
So, this has been happening
for a long time.

14:36.333 --> 14:39.500
There was only about
an inch of this piece holding
them together.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.033
[bleep], dude.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.066
The 53-ton dozer's
hydraulic lift cylinder

14:46.066 --> 14:49.700
is held in place by a bracket,
called a yoke.

14:49.700 --> 14:53.700
It pivots, allowing
the ten ton blade
to rise and fall.

14:55.467 --> 14:56.934
But it's cracked.

14:56.934 --> 15:01.166
Fred needs to swap out the old
broken part for a new one

15:01.166 --> 15:04.166
before he can get back
to stripping the Freedom cut.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.834
This is really gonna cost us.

15:10.834 --> 15:12.567
I honestly don't know
what the hell I'm going to do.

15:12.567 --> 15:15.133
Meanwhile, this is gonna
turn into more and more slop.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.900
Not good. Not good at all.

15:20.533 --> 15:23.033
Parts for a 1984 Komatsu

15:23.033 --> 15:25.000
are not easy to come by
out here.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.433
There reaches a point where
you can't bleed anymore.

15:27.433 --> 15:29.000
Kind of reaching that point
with the company.

15:51.967 --> 15:54.000
Two months into
his season,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.500
King of the Klondike,
Tony Beets,

15:56.500 --> 16:00.200
has opened up two of
the deepest cuts he's
ever mined.

16:02.233 --> 16:06.567
So far, they've delivered
just over 900 ounces.

16:06.567 --> 16:10.433
280 ounces less than this time
last season.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.567
To get more gold,
Tony's got another trick
up his sleeve.

16:41.934 --> 16:46.600
First mined
three seasons ago
by daughter, Monica,

16:46.600 --> 16:50.033
Tony's cut down on
Hunker creek has
been plagued...

16:50.033 --> 16:52.066
What just happened?

16:53.834 --> 16:55.166
...by breakdowns...

16:56.033 --> 16:57.467
...frozen pay...

16:57.467 --> 16:59.867
I seem to have
hit some frost.

16:59.867 --> 17:01.333
...and floods...

17:01.333 --> 17:03.634
Should've named it
the Cursed Cut,
not the Hunker Cut.

17:03.634 --> 17:06.934
...leading Monica
to abandon the Cursed Cut.

17:08.967 --> 17:11.867
Tony is leasing it to
the Winchester boys.

17:11.867 --> 17:15.867
Three new miners hoping to
strike it rich in the Yukon.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.934
We're gold miners,
so we like to have, you know,

17:20.934 --> 17:23.400
buckets of gold if we can
get it in our hands.

17:23.400 --> 17:29.100
Leading the crew
is mine boss and construction
worker, Jason Fraser.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.767
My buddy John there
built the plant.

17:31.767 --> 17:34.066
And said, "Well, we'll
come up and give it a try."

17:34.066 --> 17:38.600
Figured it might be a chance
to at least get your boots wet
here in Klondike.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.700
We'll catch some gold here.

17:40.700 --> 17:43.867
Retired business
owner, John Van Thuyl

17:43.867 --> 17:45.667
is the crew's mechanic.

17:45.667 --> 17:48.166
I've never mined in
the Yukon before.

17:48.166 --> 17:49.500
I'm semi-retired.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.700
I built the wash plant
in my driveway up at home.

17:52.700 --> 17:55.567
Five years from now, I hope
to have a five gallon bucket
of gold,

17:55.567 --> 17:57.200
and I'm gonna totally retire.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.600
I got lots of friends that
say that they would love
to do mining

18:00.600 --> 18:02.133
but I'm here doing it.

18:03.934 --> 18:08.667
Running the heavy
equipment is ex-logger,
Patrick "Butch" Bouchard.

18:32.233 --> 18:36.400
It's an extremely expensive
operation to be involved in.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.400
It's definitely high risk,
high reward.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.367
If this doesn't work out,

18:40.367 --> 18:43.400
I'm sure Butch will be
processing logs again
all next winter,

18:43.400 --> 18:46.467
and John likely will be
plowing snow from Ontario.

18:46.467 --> 18:50.333
And myself, I'll be most
likely digging basements
in Vancouver Island.

18:58.333 --> 18:59.433
Better than the Three Stooges.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.800
- How've you been?
- Fine.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.200
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm John.

19:06.600 --> 19:07.834
The Hunker Cut it is.

19:07.834 --> 19:09.800
- Is it cursed for
you guys?
- Don't say it!

19:09.800 --> 19:11.800
Don't say it. Yeah.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.467
For us, everything that
could go wrong, went wrong.

19:14.467 --> 19:15.934
I don't believe
in curses.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.767
Yeah. I hope so.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.834
Think we can get somewheres
around our goal of 200, 250.

19:39.834 --> 19:41.433
Gotta walk your
Kiwi plant out of the way.

19:41.433 --> 19:43.100
If you can get that out,
we'll get set up.

19:47.133 --> 19:48.000
That sounds good.

19:55.667 --> 20:00.900
Once Tony's old
Kiwi wash plant is moved
from the middle of the cut,

20:00.900 --> 20:05.767
the new crew will haul in
their homemade
60-yard an hour wash plant,

20:05.767 --> 20:07.567
the Winchester.

20:07.567 --> 20:10.166
980 hours to build
the wash plant.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.500
I was only gonna do one drum,

20:12.500 --> 20:14.834
and then my wife says,
"Well, why don't you do two?"

20:14.834 --> 20:16.834
That's why we called
it "Winchester".

20:16.834 --> 20:19.400
It's a double barrel shotgun.

20:19.400 --> 20:23.266
They plan to run
ground already stripped
by Tony,

20:23.266 --> 20:27.500
chasing gold left behind
by the old timer's dredges.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.533
John to Jason, you got a copy?

20:29.533 --> 20:31.700
Mike Beets is coming down
the hill.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.133
How you gentlemen
this morning?

20:41.133 --> 20:41.967
We good, buddy. You?

20:42.600 --> 20:44.333
I hate rain.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.500
Well, once we get the eyes
exposed, then we can attach it
to the D10,

20:47.500 --> 20:49.033
so that we can pull the thing.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.834
So, your eye will be
around over here.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.700
Scrape it clean until
we can see the eyes.

21:01.467 --> 21:03.300
It's really sticking out
quite decently.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.867
So now I'm trying to wonder
where the [bleep] it is,

21:04.867 --> 21:06.967
just might be lower
and sitting more further back.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.600
Could you get it
a little deeper?

21:11.500 --> 21:13.767
If they can't find
the eye hooks,

21:13.767 --> 21:17.834
the stranded Kiwi plant will
block the Winchester's access,

21:17.834 --> 21:20.400
stopping them from
mining gold.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.000
- Do we have a shovel?
- Eh?

21:25.834 --> 21:26.667
That's so weird.

21:28.667 --> 21:30.800
- Well, there's an eye.
- Kind of looks like
a rock.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.033
No, that is the eye.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.500
So the other one will be
right here.

21:37.367 --> 21:38.734
- Ouch.
- Oh, there you go.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.734
- If you can start
hooking those up.
- Yeah.

21:42.734 --> 21:45.734
I'll hop in the dozer
and we can back her up,
and we should be all good.

21:54.767 --> 21:55.834
Timber.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.934
Whatever it takes
to move it.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.300
It's good to go now.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.533
Kiwi plant
out of the way...

22:03.533 --> 22:05.600
Good luck, gentlemen.

22:05.600 --> 22:10.033
...the Winchester
boys are one step closer
to catching gold

22:10.033 --> 22:12.467
and delivering
Tony's royalties.

22:13.867 --> 22:14.900
One more piece, boys.

22:15.934 --> 22:18.300
We can get back to work
and make some real gold.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.433
We've invested
a ton of money, a ton of time

22:33.433 --> 22:35.066
into the Panama Canal cut.

22:35.066 --> 22:38.734
If we can't get a sluice
this year, it's gonna be
nothing but a loss.

22:40.300 --> 22:41.900
At Indian River...

22:41.900 --> 22:43.400
What's happening, man?

22:43.400 --> 22:46.900
...Parker has
tasked Mitch with using
all their resources

22:46.900 --> 22:49.433
to open up and mine
an access road.

22:50.266 --> 22:52.100
The Panama Canal cut.

22:52.100 --> 22:55.500
As well as building a new
access road

22:55.500 --> 22:59.200
and keeping the rest of
the operation on track.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.634
Well, we got all the mud off,
but all the gravel's frozen.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.000
It gets tons of
sun and...

23:09.000 --> 23:12.200
- Yeah.
- ...high and dry, it makes
no sense to me.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.934
Well, and the one we needed
to be thawed more than
any of them is this one.

23:14.934 --> 23:15.767
Right?

23:16.767 --> 23:18.767
What do you think
we should do?

23:18.767 --> 23:21.934
Well, man I hate walking away
from something after we've
poured a bunch of money in it,

23:21.934 --> 23:26.500
but it's a matter of what has
more gold, I guess.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.500
If we have to walk away from
something, it should be
this one,

23:28.500 --> 23:29.834
not the ones downstream.

23:29.834 --> 23:30.667
Don't you think?

23:33.166 --> 23:34.400
We have to get out of here.

23:35.433 --> 23:37.433
I think that's the only thing
we can do.

23:37.433 --> 23:39.367
Yeah, I think it's gonna be
this way all year.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.600
- All right. Thanks, Mitch.
- Yep.

23:45.100 --> 23:47.700
This isn't
an ideal scenario but...

23:47.700 --> 23:50.867
we've gotta go get all the mud
off the areas that have mud,

23:50.867 --> 23:53.467
and then figure out what we're
gonna do with frozen gravel.

23:53.467 --> 23:55.934
Ripping frozen mud
is not too expensive.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.567
Ripping frozen gravel
is intense.

23:58.567 --> 24:01.367
And we're gonna have to rip
a whole pile of frozen gravel
this fall,

24:01.367 --> 24:03.266
because of how much we've
taken on.

24:05.667 --> 24:06.834
Panama Canal,

24:06.834 --> 24:09.000
is a project we really didn't
have the time to start,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.033
but now, Parker doesn't
want us to finish it.

24:11.033 --> 24:13.834
And that's just
a huge waste of time
and a huge waste of money.

24:15.900 --> 24:18.934
Right now, we really need
to get this new road done.

24:18.934 --> 24:22.734
Before Mitch's crew
can go back to work
in the airstrip,

24:22.734 --> 24:27.967
they need to finish
the new road to restore access
across the claim.

24:27.967 --> 24:31.166
We're working on this end here
which is through one of
our tailings pile,

24:31.166 --> 24:34.166
so this is pretty good
material off the other side.

24:34.166 --> 24:36.066
It's real nasty stuff.

24:36.066 --> 24:38.934
And the trucks are having
a hard time getting
through there.

24:38.934 --> 24:42.834
I've got no access for anybody
to get back and forth here.

24:42.834 --> 24:44.967
So, it's really put
a time crunch on this.

24:46.900 --> 24:50.100
Mitch has got me
running tailings to finish
this road.

24:50.100 --> 24:52.033
Just so much mud.

24:53.233 --> 24:55.800
It makes driving these things
hard as well.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.300
I can feel my truck going to
get bogged every time nearly.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.700
I don't feel very confident
in the mud.

25:03.700 --> 25:06.166
Parker definitely
likes to throw you in
the deep end

25:06.166 --> 25:08.166
and you just have to hope
that you swim.

25:12.567 --> 25:15.133
Hey, Mitch.
You got a copy, Mitch?

25:15.133 --> 25:17.600
- Go ahead.
- Yeah, hey man,
there's not enough pay up

25:17.600 --> 25:19.800
at Big Red or Sluicifer
for them to run tonight.

25:20.934 --> 25:23.467
Right now I'm looking at
3000-4000 yards of material

25:23.467 --> 25:24.934
and we need double that.

25:24.934 --> 25:29.000
So, we need to steal some
resources and move some
iron up here.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.333
Ah, man, This road's gonna
take a little bit here.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.500
It's got a pretty good section
that's real snotty.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.834
But as soon as
we get this road done,

25:35.834 --> 25:38.000
I'll be sending everybody
back to you, bud.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.734
Just gonna have to make do
for right now, buddy.

25:39.734 --> 25:41.266
I don't know about you
but I don't wanna see

25:41.266 --> 25:42.734
either of these plants
go down tonight.

25:45.867 --> 25:47.934
Until the road
is finished,

25:47.934 --> 25:51.767
the crew can't get back
to stockpiling paydirt
at the plant,

25:52.433 --> 25:55.567
risking a double shutdown.

25:55.567 --> 25:57.233
Tyson just hit me up
'cause it doesn't look like

25:57.233 --> 25:59.066
we've got enough dirt
for nightshift.

25:59.066 --> 26:01.100
That's what happens when
we got so many projects.

26:01.100 --> 26:03.200
You don't do anything well.

26:03.200 --> 26:07.133
This road is something
you'd normally like to have
well ahead of time done.

26:07.133 --> 26:10.700
But Parker sprung this on us.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.700
He's bouncing back and forth
between lots of ideas.

26:13.700 --> 26:17.200
As a mine boss,
you need to make a
decision and stick with it.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.934
Mitch has
his whole crew finishing up

26:20.934 --> 26:24.467
the last 350 feet
of the new road.

26:24.467 --> 26:27.300
You wanna try and get me
a spot here where I can get

26:27.300 --> 26:29.266
this new road connected.

26:29.266 --> 26:32.033
Let the trucks know we'll
have them start
dumping there.

26:32.033 --> 26:34.100
It ain't gonna be pretty
but it'll work.

26:34.100 --> 26:37.767
- Pretty? It never pretty.
- As long as it works.

26:37.767 --> 26:41.967
We're lucky that
we got everybody on deck
and working

26:41.967 --> 26:46.100
to build this road
right here, right now.

26:46.100 --> 26:49.967
Parker's lucky he's got guys
that are good at more than
one thing.

26:51.834 --> 26:53.333
Hey, Mitch.
You got a copy?

26:56.133 --> 26:59.367
When are you hoping to finish
off with your crew over there?

26:59.367 --> 27:01.100
Hurrying to try
and get this done.

27:01.100 --> 27:02.934
[bleep] We just don't
have enough pay.

27:02.934 --> 27:04.533
So, we don't have
much time to do this.

27:05.467 --> 27:07.467
Time is not on our side.

27:09.834 --> 27:11.600
Truck's hauling
coarse tailings.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.233
This is where I want you
to drop it.

27:13.233 --> 27:15.533
We're gonna tie it back
into that other material
you've been putting down.

27:15.533 --> 27:17.600
Okay, thank you.

27:17.600 --> 27:22.133
Just machinery going
everywhere, it's so intense.

27:22.133 --> 27:25.634
Parker just has such
a all or nothing personality.

27:25.634 --> 27:27.767
If he's gonna do something,
he's does it a 100 percent.

27:27.767 --> 27:31.233
If this was my mine site,
I'd probably make the same
decision as Parker did.

27:31.233 --> 27:34.300
I know it sounds risky
and it's full on and there's
lots going on.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.200
But as a gold miner,

27:36.200 --> 27:37.767
you just can't leave
gold in the ground.

27:40.266 --> 27:41.834
Yeah,
keep coming back.
Keep coming back.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.533
We're gonna go right off
the edge here.

27:43.533 --> 27:44.667
There you go, right there.

27:51.367 --> 27:53.100
This will be our road.

27:53.100 --> 27:57.166
We got little bit of mud
on top of the gravel.

27:57.166 --> 27:59.967
So, truck that are sinking
could get moving.

28:01.667 --> 28:05.266
And we got this road done.

28:05.266 --> 28:08.266
12 hours since
they began the build,

28:08.266 --> 28:11.500
Mitch and crew have
finished the new access road.

28:14.700 --> 28:16.367
We got ourselves a road here.

28:16.367 --> 28:17.934
It's come along real good.

28:17.934 --> 28:21.000
It's been a lot of work.
It should definitely do
the job.

28:22.433 --> 28:24.433
Mitch is sending me
back to the wash plant.

28:25.433 --> 28:27.800
Moving the old road
and building a new one,

28:27.800 --> 28:29.967
that's just, like, insane.

28:29.967 --> 28:33.266
I'm actually stoked I actually
helped such a huge project.

28:34.300 --> 28:36.133
Hey,
Tyson, you got a copy?

28:36.133 --> 28:40.467
The road is finished and
the trucks are heading back
over to you right now.

28:40.467 --> 28:43.100
Yeah,
sounds good. I'll meet you
at the wash plants.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.467
Just in time, buddy.

28:45.834 --> 28:47.934
You know, pretty happy with
how this road turned out.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.834
We just had to do it
quick and fast.

28:49.834 --> 28:52.433
But we've got good access
back down to the wash plants.

28:52.433 --> 28:55.500
One more thing that Parker's
added to our already
busy schedule,

28:55.500 --> 28:57.967
but somehow we were able
to make it all happen.

28:57.967 --> 28:59.300
It's been a hell of a day.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.900
But, you know, I'm really
happy with how things
turned out here.

29:12.333 --> 29:15.433
Had this freaking dozer for
two days and now it's stuck
in the slop.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.300
At
California Creek,

29:18.300 --> 29:21.700
Fred Lewis's crew are
busy sluicing pay.

29:21.700 --> 29:25.533
But his new dozer has
a broken yoke bracket.

29:25.533 --> 29:29.900
It's a 1984 dozer. Honestly,
I don't know where the
I'm gonna find a part for it.

29:29.900 --> 29:32.400
I think Troy did mention
he had some spare parts.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.734
So, I'm gonna call him.

29:33.734 --> 29:35.634
Hail Mary. Hopefully,
he's got what I'm looking for.

29:35.634 --> 29:38.800
But if we can't get this
dozer going, we are [bleep].

29:44.834 --> 29:46.300
Hey, Troy. How's it going?

29:48.233 --> 29:50.266
Um, we're having a little
bit of a problem.

29:50.266 --> 29:51.300
It's the lift cylinder.

29:53.100 --> 29:56.133
I was hoping to see if maybe
you might have

29:56.133 --> 29:59.133
parts laying around that we
could come and scavenge from?

30:09.500 --> 30:14.000
Okay, so would you mind
me sending Buzz out there to
come and check it out?

30:16.433 --> 30:18.300
I appreciate it.
I'll let you get back to work.

30:19.266 --> 30:20.400
yeah.

30:20.400 --> 30:23.567
We got the part. So I can send
Buzz out right now.

30:23.567 --> 30:26.200
Without it, we'd be probably
down two or three weeks.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.433
Now, we can get that dozer
back up and running.

30:40.634 --> 30:42.667
At
Fred Lewis's claim,

30:42.667 --> 30:47.233
Buzz returns from his 300 mile
round trip to Keno

30:47.233 --> 30:49.600
with the part to fix
the broken dozer.

30:49.600 --> 30:53.066
It took me about 13 hours.

30:53.066 --> 30:54.200
Had to be done.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.000
Cut my sleep time
rather short,

30:56.000 --> 30:59.834
but sacrifices a guy
has gotta make to be
a successful miner.

31:01.700 --> 31:04.166
Starting to get pretty
damn sloppy out here.

31:05.900 --> 31:07.200
Broken going out.

31:10.333 --> 31:11.533
Get the new one in.

31:13.934 --> 31:15.233
Pretty heavy.

31:32.734 --> 31:36.033
It's kind of [bleep] to do
this by yourself.

31:36.033 --> 31:37.700
She's ready to
rock and roll again.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.300
Talk about timing.

31:43.700 --> 31:46.767
- How's it going?
- Whoo! Holy [bleep],
Buzz.

31:46.767 --> 31:48.400
Can't believe you did this
by yourself.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.500
- What a pain in the ass.
Great work, dude.
- Yeah.

31:51.500 --> 31:54.133
While you're here,
just put those parts
in the back.

31:54.133 --> 31:56.900
- Yes.
- I'll let you
carry the big piece.

31:56.900 --> 31:58.166
Oh, jeez, what is that?

31:58.900 --> 32:00.800
Oh my [bleep].

32:00.800 --> 32:02.834
I see why you wanted me
to carry this one.

32:04.066 --> 32:06.300
Oh, my [bleep].

32:10.333 --> 32:13.033
Fire this puppy up.
Let's push some muck.

32:14.433 --> 32:18.333
Just 24 hours
after the dozer went down...

32:18.333 --> 32:20.667
Everything seems
right and tight.

32:21.834 --> 32:23.533
Ready to rip and strip.

32:23.533 --> 32:27.533
...Buzz has it back
stripping in the Freedom cut.

32:27.533 --> 32:31.834
Buzz is busting his balls
to get that dozer back
up and running.

32:31.834 --> 32:33.834
We'll fix every single problem
and eventually,

32:33.834 --> 32:35.300
we're gonna pull the gold
out of this ground.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.333
We're gonna keep fighting.

33:08.433 --> 33:10.900
So, today, we're gonna
get her hooked up.

33:10.900 --> 33:13.166
We back Winchester down
into the corner.

33:13.166 --> 33:17.734
The Winchester boys
are racing to get their
wash plant up and running

33:17.734 --> 33:20.734
to prove to Tony that
they can catch gold

33:20.734 --> 33:23.233
and deliver his
30 percent royalties.

33:41.266 --> 33:43.467
I'm not using
a chain on Winchester.

33:43.467 --> 33:44.967
I don't wanna mark
the paint up.

33:44.967 --> 33:47.100
Try to keep her as nice
as we can for now.

33:49.166 --> 33:50.033
Okay, Butch.

34:04.233 --> 34:06.600
I want it another
foot and a half this way.

34:07.100 --> 34:07.900
Okay.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.900
Butch, tighten the strap.
Oh, no.

34:13.900 --> 34:14.734
Butch!

34:15.867 --> 34:17.033
Holy [bleep].

34:23.567 --> 34:25.467
He caught it
before it went over.

34:27.033 --> 34:30.333
We're good. Little stressful.
But we're good.

34:30.333 --> 34:33.367
Now that the plant
is placed safely on the pad,

34:33.367 --> 34:36.800
all they need to do is connect
the sluice boxes.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.600
And they're ready to run pay.

34:42.066 --> 34:43.634
Is that gonna go
under there?

34:44.900 --> 34:45.800
I hope so.

34:48.700 --> 34:49.533
Um...

34:52.467 --> 34:53.767
Hm.

34:53.767 --> 34:56.066
- Leg is in the way
'cause of the angle.
- I see.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.767
In my driveway,
I set everything to fit
on the other side.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.200
I thought it was the same.

35:05.967 --> 35:07.667
Okay, well that's not
gonna work.

35:09.166 --> 35:12.200
Ah, [bleep].
It's always something.

35:14.734 --> 35:19.634
John's
homemade plant is a unique
dual-barrel trommel.

35:19.634 --> 35:24.500
Pay from the feed conveyer
is split evenly between both.

35:24.500 --> 35:29.667
High pressure jets clean
the rocks as they spin in
the trommels.

35:29.667 --> 35:35.300
Gold-rich slurry then runs out
the two chutes into
the sluice boxes.

35:35.300 --> 35:38.166
When it was built,
the sluice boxes were attached

35:38.166 --> 35:39.934
to the right side
of the plant.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.700
Now, the tailings
conveyer setup

35:43.700 --> 35:45.934
means they need to be
on the left.

35:45.934 --> 35:49.233
But a supporting leg
makes that impossible.

35:49.233 --> 35:53.967
To fix, John needs to build
an extension to
the diversion chute,

35:53.967 --> 35:56.166
allowing it to get
around the leg,

35:56.166 --> 35:58.600
and direct paydirt to
the sluice boxes.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.367
You know,
we're a tiny crew.
We're three people.

36:15.367 --> 36:17.033
Time is money, like everybody.

36:17.033 --> 36:19.166
But maybe more so
when you're small.

36:19.166 --> 36:20.433
You look at
the Beets' operation,

36:20.433 --> 36:22.867
they can call in
a service truck or a mechanic.

36:22.867 --> 36:25.033
And for us, it stops
until we fix it.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.166
Hook that little eyelet on.

36:45.533 --> 36:47.266
Looks like it's gonna
work okay.

36:56.300 --> 36:59.867
Well, now we gotta get dirt
into the plant and get gold
out of the sluice box.

37:01.133 --> 37:03.367
After
a 12-hour delay,

37:03.367 --> 37:06.900
the Winchesters are finally
ready to run pay.

37:11.300 --> 37:12.400
That's Winchester.

37:33.100 --> 37:34.133
Power her up.

38:03.100 --> 38:04.800
They call this
the Cursed Cut.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.934
But if you believe in curses,
then you're beat already.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.367
Looks like all of
the calculations kind of
worked out.

38:18.367 --> 38:21.667
The water's flowing,
beautiful, the boxes are
behaving properly.

38:42.266 --> 38:43.734
Today is a good day.
I'm going to pick up Khara.

38:43.734 --> 38:45.734
And I haven't seen her in
probably about two
and a half months.

38:51.266 --> 38:53.367
Oh, baby!

38:53.367 --> 38:54.934
Well, that's her plane.

38:56.900 --> 39:00.634
- Hi!
- Hey, baby! Mm.

39:00.634 --> 39:03.133
I'm gonna crush you.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.066
Are you ready to see the mine?
You gotta meet The Tank.

39:07.066 --> 39:08.734
I knew you were
gonna jump right into that.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.467
We should probably
talk about finances.

39:14.467 --> 39:16.033
- You can't have any
more money.
- With the finances...

39:16.033 --> 39:17.533
- No more money.
- Yeah, for three months.

39:17.533 --> 39:20.233
Maybe you don't look at
the finances and just
kind of trust me on it?

39:20.233 --> 39:21.700
'Cause it's getting
kind of scary.

39:21.700 --> 39:23.400
But I got it.

39:23.400 --> 39:26.400
- Just trust me.
- You say this
every year.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.333
-"Just trust me." We barely
squeak by.
- Shouldn't have trusted me

39:28.333 --> 39:29.367
in Oregon, by the way.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.567
I didn't trust you
in Oregon.

39:31.567 --> 39:33.367
- Tough love. Tough love.
- I need it.

39:33.367 --> 39:34.367
- Ow.
- Sorry.

40:00.700 --> 40:03.100
Two days
after firing up,

40:03.100 --> 40:06.967
it's time to see if
the Winchester boys have
broken the curse,

40:06.967 --> 40:08.367
and delivered gold.

40:09.934 --> 40:11.233
- Hello, guys.
- Ha ha!

40:12.667 --> 40:13.834
I got the loot.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.600
We ran for 25 hours
straight and...

40:22.934 --> 40:24.066
Yeah.

40:24.066 --> 40:25.467
- Gives you some faith
in the box.
- Yeah.

40:26.066 --> 40:27.233
Yeah. Yeah.

40:30.333 --> 40:31.934
Oh, yeah.

40:31.934 --> 40:36.233
Tony's hoping
the 25 hour run will deliver
seven ounces of gold.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.400
So, somebody wanna do
some counting?

40:42.500 --> 40:43.767
- Tear away.
- Tear it off.

40:44.634 --> 40:45.700
That's zero.

40:48.033 --> 40:50.567
One ounce, two ounce,

40:51.433 --> 40:53.367
two and a half, three,

40:54.233 --> 40:55.934
three and a half, four,

40:56.600 --> 40:58.033
four and a half, five,

40:58.834 --> 41:02.100
five and a half, 6.125 ounces.

41:13.200 --> 41:16.500
Worth more
than $11,000,

41:16.500 --> 41:20.667
a strong start to
the Winchesters' first season
in the Yukon.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.834
Portioned just about
half an ounce an hour.

41:34.333 --> 41:35.233
Really?

41:35.233 --> 41:37.100
Those top gravels would've
been lean anyway

41:37.100 --> 41:39.133
because they've been
washed out for the last
few years.

41:39.133 --> 41:41.900
We can do a little better
on the yardage recovery then

41:41.900 --> 41:43.300
we're definitely in the game.

41:47.300 --> 41:48.100
Well, you did.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.734
"Hm".
He says, "Hm."

41:51.734 --> 41:53.500
Now he perks up.

41:55.634 --> 41:56.734
Nice to see you again.

42:10.667 --> 42:12.700
Each cut that we take
should progress to

42:12.700 --> 42:15.567
more and more gold,
the deeper we go.

42:15.567 --> 42:18.000
And hopefully, Winchester's
up for the task.

42:18.567 --> 42:19.667
We are.

42:19.667 --> 42:21.734
That's just the tip
of the iceberg for us.

42:21.734 --> 42:23.967
We still have a full 100 days
ahead of us.

42:23.967 --> 42:26.133
We're not gonna really
discuss the curse bit.

42:26.133 --> 42:27.500
But I think we beat it.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.634
I'd like to think we beat it.

42:47.667 --> 42:49.667
All right, guys.
First gold weigh.

42:49.667 --> 42:50.867
- You guys excited?
- Yeah.

42:50.867 --> 42:51.734
[bleep] Yeah.

42:51.734 --> 42:54.133
We need a fire going here.

42:54.133 --> 42:57.867
It's a momentous
day for Fred Lewis
and his crew.

42:57.867 --> 43:01.467
After battling for ten weeks
to get on the gold,

43:01.467 --> 43:05.233
it's time for their first
gold weigh of the season.

43:05.233 --> 43:07.033
It's really awesome to
have Khara here.

43:07.033 --> 43:09.800
Mama's in town, it just
completes the mine site.

43:09.800 --> 43:12.066
Well, I'm excited.
We're gonna make it happen
this season.

43:12.066 --> 43:13.433
Yeah.

43:13.433 --> 43:15.700
Buzz, you saved us this week

43:15.700 --> 43:17.634
and we really appreciate that.

43:17.634 --> 43:18.934
Look at Buzz go, man.

43:18.934 --> 43:21.266
We're just
getting started.

43:21.266 --> 43:23.100
Well, seeing
getting started...

43:23.100 --> 43:24.700
- You wanna see gold.
- I'm ready. I'm ready.

43:24.700 --> 43:26.600
- I know.
- I wanna see what
we've got.

43:26.600 --> 43:29.066
- Last season...
- Okay, here we go.

43:29.066 --> 43:32.834
...Fred's first
gold weigh
delivered 8.4 ounces.

43:33.734 --> 43:36.667
One, two...

43:37.433 --> 43:41.600
- three, four...
- Oh?

43:41.600 --> 43:44.233
- ...five.
- Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

43:44.233 --> 43:46.300
Uh, six.

43:46.300 --> 43:47.634
- Six point oh.
- Six point oh.

43:47.634 --> 43:49.700
Six point oh,
on the dot.

43:49.700 --> 43:54.266
Six ounces falls
far short of where the crew
need to be

43:54.266 --> 43:57.600
in order to hit their
500 ounce season goal.

44:01.133 --> 44:05.200
You know, this is still more
than we mined the entire
first [bleep] season we mined.

44:05.200 --> 44:07.333
Even though it's been
miserable hard work

44:07.333 --> 44:09.667
and we haven't got a lot
of gold to show for it,

44:09.667 --> 44:10.800
we're paying the bills.

44:10.800 --> 44:13.467
- We need to get better at it
to get rich.
- Yeah.

44:15.233 --> 44:17.900
This is the worst run
we're gonna have all season.

44:17.900 --> 44:19.033
We've now got a dozer.

44:19.033 --> 44:21.400
Like, we're in the position
we wanted to be.

44:21.400 --> 44:24.700
So, now we need to put
serios yardage to the plant,
and keep it going.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.100
Now, get back to work.

44:28.967 --> 44:31.100
Six ounces in a week.

44:31.100 --> 44:33.700
Not even close to cutting it.
We need that everyday.

44:33.700 --> 44:35.800
'Cause I feel like that was
a bunch of [bleep].

44:35.800 --> 44:37.533
But I just gotta figure out
a way to keep the guys'
hope up.

44:37.533 --> 44:40.000
That we're still...

44:41.266 --> 44:43.400
We're still here mining,
we're still pulling in gold.

44:43.400 --> 44:45.834
But to put all the work
that we put in

44:45.834 --> 44:49.967
to this point of the season,
and to walk out with
six freaking ounces,

44:49.967 --> 44:52.300
it's not where I wanna be,
but we gotta get better.

45:01.033 --> 45:02.600
- What's shaking, buddy?
- How's it going, man?

45:02.600 --> 45:03.834
Good. Good.

45:03.834 --> 45:05.700
- How's it going, Doumitt?
- Good, how're you
doing, buddy?

45:05.700 --> 45:07.367
Good, thanks.
How are you feeling?

45:07.367 --> 45:10.934
Yeah, it's been a fight, man,
keeping both wash plants going
side by side.

45:10.934 --> 45:13.333
- They make you work.
- Oh, the two together,

45:13.333 --> 45:15.033
they do,
they grind through the pay.

45:15.033 --> 45:17.367
I was a little worried about
that for a while. It's getting
pretty skinny down there.

45:17.367 --> 45:19.367
But yeah, not long
after we had that road built,

45:19.367 --> 45:20.667
started pushing the overburden

45:20.667 --> 45:22.900
and everything was frozen.

45:23.467 --> 45:24.734
I was wrong.

45:24.734 --> 45:26.634
I freely admit that.

45:26.634 --> 45:28.867
- And...
- I totally thought that
would be thawed.

45:29.533 --> 45:30.634
It's very frozen.

45:32.467 --> 45:34.166
Now, what do we do
with Panama Canal?

45:34.166 --> 45:37.100
Yeah, we'll have to just
let it thaw and see

45:37.100 --> 45:39.100
if it's ready by the end
of the year,

45:39.100 --> 45:40.767
and if we have time
to sluice it.

45:40.767 --> 45:44.634
It's gonna be tough to get
that worked into everything
else we got going on, man.

45:44.634 --> 45:48.533
Yeah, at the beginning of
the season when we started,
it was little overwhelming

45:48.533 --> 45:50.200
in the amount we have to do.

45:50.200 --> 45:52.200
Yeah. It's one of those things
I think it's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.567
- It's all mind game.
It's all head game.
- Is that what it is?

45:54.567 --> 45:56.867
- Yeah.
- We're a third way
through the season already.

45:56.867 --> 45:58.667
Yeah, well, how much
gold do we got there?

45:58.667 --> 46:00.500
We a third of weight of
where we want to be?

46:00.500 --> 46:01.600
Let's take a look see.

46:01.600 --> 46:03.533
- We'll do Big Red first, yeah?
- All right.

46:03.533 --> 46:04.467
Get in there!

46:04.467 --> 46:05.700
Last week,

46:05.700 --> 46:11.100
Big Red delivered
a 124.3 ounces of
bare cut gold.

46:11.100 --> 46:13.200
Let's see what she did
this week, buddy.

46:13.967 --> 46:18.000
All right. 20, 40, 60,

46:18.467 --> 46:21.500
100, 120, 140,

46:22.200 --> 46:24.700
160, 180, 190...

46:24.700 --> 46:27.066
Oh! 200. 220.

46:27.734 --> 46:31.233
230, 240, 250...

46:32.634 --> 46:35.934
257.9. [bleep] yeah.

46:35.934 --> 46:39.233
It's about time we started
having some big numbers.

46:39.233 --> 46:40.834
What's the other one?

46:40.834 --> 46:43.967
Sluicifer's haul
from the Bear cut last week

46:43.967 --> 46:46.734
was a 174.9 ounces.

46:48.233 --> 46:50.800
80, 110,

46:51.433 --> 46:54.033
140, 170,

46:55.066 --> 46:56.634
- over 200.
- Yeah.

46:57.634 --> 46:59.834
- Come on. Come on.
- 230, 240,

46:59.834 --> 47:03.000
250, 260, 270...

47:03.000 --> 47:06.133
- Yeah!
- 289.05.

47:06.133 --> 47:07.500
- There we go!
- Yeah!

47:07.500 --> 47:09.033
- Whoo!
- Chest bump.

47:09.033 --> 47:10.800
No.

47:11.533 --> 47:13.700
Oh!

47:14.834 --> 47:16.600
Not a bad
week, fellas.

47:18.533 --> 47:21.033
Parker's crew
have pulled in mor than

47:21.033 --> 47:25.400
$980,000 worth of gold
this week,

47:25.400 --> 47:30.333
bringing their season total
to over 2,300 ounces.

47:30.333 --> 47:33.467
Man,
that's pretty cool to see,
even after everything,

47:33.467 --> 47:34.800
fighting with that road...

47:34.800 --> 47:37.233
It's encouragement when you
put in that much work
and effort

47:37.233 --> 47:39.333
- that you get good numbers.
- Yeah.

47:39.333 --> 47:42.600
- Doesn't always go that way.
- No, but it did this time.

47:42.600 --> 47:44.333
- And hopefully will
next time.
- That's cool, man.

47:44.333 --> 47:47.433
- I'll bag this stuff up.
We'll get out of here.
- All right, man. Thanks!

47:47.433 --> 47:49.300
You betcha.
Thank you, you guys.

47:49.300 --> 47:50.800
- Thanks, Chris.
- Thanks, guys.

47:52.967 --> 47:56.333
You know, I really feel like
we wasted a lot of time this
week building that new road

47:56.333 --> 47:57.900
and stripping
the Panama Canal.

47:57.900 --> 48:00.800
Pretty tough, but when you see
that much gold at the end
of it all,

48:01.667 --> 48:02.700
definitely worth it.
