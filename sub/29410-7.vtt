WEBVTT

00:04.830 --> 00:06.963
We're gonna have
a guys' weekend.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.139
I got us a car.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.358
BRIGHT:
I think something bad

00:10.401 --> 00:13.448
happened in this station wagon.

00:28.245 --> 00:29.725
[metallic jangling]

00:40.997 --> 00:42.433
[jangling]

00:47.395 --> 00:48.744
[jangling]

00:55.011 --> 00:56.752
Hey!

00:58.014 --> 00:59.320
Is this your junkyard?

01:03.759 --> 01:06.109
[gunshots]

01:27.435 --> 01:29.089
He was dressed like a mechanic.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.221
Looked like he worked here.

01:31.265 --> 01:33.267
Not sure I got enough
for a sketch.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.269
You're lucky
he didn't kill you, Bright.

01:36.313 --> 01:38.446
What the hell were you
even doing here?

01:38.489 --> 01:40.274
Do you believe
in repressed memory?

01:40.317 --> 01:42.580
If I said no, will you go home?
Take a few days off?

01:42.624 --> 01:44.800
I've been having dreams
about this car.

01:47.324 --> 01:50.501
Memories, really.

01:50.545 --> 01:53.243
They're cloudy, but I know

01:53.287 --> 01:55.071
that my father took me
on a camping trip

01:55.115 --> 01:56.377
the week before he was arrested.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.902
Bad things happened.

01:59.945 --> 02:01.164
In this car.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.560
Tags from the DMV confirm it?

02:05.603 --> 02:07.779
[quietly]:
Yeah, it's the same car.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.261
-I know it sounds crazy.
-I wish it did.

02:11.305 --> 02:13.045
When they looked around
in the junkyard,

02:13.089 --> 02:14.264
they found something.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.310
A body of a woman was found

02:16.353 --> 02:18.616
crushed in a car compactor.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.401
[siren wailing in distance]

02:21.358 --> 02:23.795
You good?
I heard you got shot at.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.798
At. Thankfully.

02:27.973 --> 02:30.454
Is that a pizza spatula?

02:30.498 --> 02:32.108
Oh, it's actually called
a pizza peel,

02:32.152 --> 02:35.024
derived from the French word
for shovel-- there you go--

02:35.067 --> 02:38.201
-which is weird
because pizza's Italian.
-DANI: Yeah.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.594
That's what's weird.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.073
EDRISA:
You know what? These puppies

02:41.117 --> 02:43.337
are a little-known M.E. secret.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.860
Great for retrieving
smashed soft tissue.

02:44.903 --> 02:47.689
Or pepperoni that fell off
in the oven.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.431
Not with the same one.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.955
What do we know about the vic?

02:52.998 --> 02:54.739
Oh, not much yet.

02:54.783 --> 02:58.221
Based off of decomposition...
[grunts] I'm guessing

02:58.265 --> 02:59.875
she died a couple weeks ago.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.964
GIL:
Is it possible she wound up
in the car by accident?

03:02.007 --> 03:03.966
Maybe she OD'd?

03:04.009 --> 03:05.968
No, I don't think so.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.274
Look at these prints.

03:07.317 --> 03:08.971
I think the killer
locked her in

03:09.014 --> 03:12.888
-and then turned on
the compactor.
-[screams]

03:15.804 --> 03:17.762
Dani, see if the techs
can pull this print.

03:17.806 --> 03:21.113
And find JT. He's running down
who may have shot at Bright.

03:21.157 --> 03:22.245
JT:
No one, apparently.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.594
What do you mean?

03:23.638 --> 03:26.510
Property records list a guy
named Paul Lazar

03:26.554 --> 03:27.903
as the junkyard owner.

03:27.946 --> 03:30.514
But... he doesn't exist.

03:30.558 --> 03:31.950
No record of him anywhere.

03:31.994 --> 03:36.085
So someone buys a junkyard
under a fake name?

03:36.128 --> 03:39.306
Why?
To kill one woman?

03:39.349 --> 03:41.264
Hide The Surgeon's
station wagon?

03:41.308 --> 03:42.961
We have to consider
the possibility

03:43.005 --> 03:45.355
that your dad's car has nothing
to do with this murder.

03:45.399 --> 03:48.532
I'm just saying this body
looks pretty fresh,

03:48.576 --> 03:50.142
and your dad's been chained
to a wall for 20 years.

03:50.186 --> 03:51.709
That's a pretty good alibi.

03:51.753 --> 03:54.277
He may not have killed her,
but he's connected somehow.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.018
He has to be.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.672
My own memories brought me here.

03:57.715 --> 04:01.371
To a place with hiscar
and a dead body.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.677
That can't be a coincidence.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.896
Maybe my father
knew this killer.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.637
We'll go over the car.

04:06.681 --> 04:09.771
-If there's a connection,
we'll find it.
-Dr. Tanaka.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.034
We found more.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.165
GIL:
More what?

04:13.209 --> 04:14.950
Victims.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.910
AINSLEY:
Mom, relax, we don't have

04:18.954 --> 04:20.564
to talk about my interview
with Dad.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.087
JESSICA:
It's fine, really.

04:22.131 --> 04:23.654
I mean, it's not, but...

04:26.570 --> 04:27.832
Are these the questions

04:27.876 --> 04:29.704
that you're gonna
ask your father?

04:29.747 --> 04:31.749
My producer sent them
to Claremont.

04:31.793 --> 04:34.709
Apparently, it's good for
getting more concise answers.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.667
You can't be serious with these.

04:36.711 --> 04:39.453
You're just spoon-feeding him
softballs.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.846
I think you're mixing
your metaphors.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.457
This is exactly how
you get a psychopath

04:43.500 --> 04:44.980
to deny responsibility.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.590
-He'll just switch the focus...
-I'm sorry, it's just,

04:46.634 --> 04:48.984
I'm either throwing him
softballs or I'm...

04:49.027 --> 04:51.029
Ainsley, if you do not
have a plan

04:51.073 --> 04:53.597
to make him look bad,
he will look good.

04:53.641 --> 04:57.166
-Tell me you understand.
-Mother,

04:57.209 --> 04:59.342
these are the questions I sent.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.823
Not the questions
I'm going to ask.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.435
All right.

05:05.479 --> 05:06.610
I see what you're doing.

05:06.654 --> 05:09.787
Good. Can you stop worrying?

05:11.006 --> 05:13.965
I am far more worried now.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.358
What? Why?

05:15.402 --> 05:18.883
Thinking you are more clever
than Martin Whitly,

05:18.927 --> 05:20.624
that's the worst mistake
you can make.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.322
He'll exploit that.

05:22.365 --> 05:26.021
He'll find a way
to come off sympathetic,

05:26.064 --> 05:28.806
-and youwill be left
sitting there, like...
-Like what?

05:30.852 --> 05:32.332
His accomplice.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.381
GIL:
Okay, Bright,

05:38.425 --> 05:40.514
we've got
JT and Dani canvassing...

05:42.037 --> 05:43.386
Are...

05:43.430 --> 05:46.128
-Are all these from...?
-The junkyard.

05:46.171 --> 05:48.391
Each one from a compacted car.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.045
Most were killed
five to ten years ago--

05:50.088 --> 05:51.655
that's why
you're seeing skeletons--

05:51.699 --> 05:53.875
some more recently
like this one.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.357
Have you determined
cause of death?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.533
Crush injuries.
You were right.

05:59.576 --> 06:00.838
She went into the car alive,

06:00.882 --> 06:02.753
then the compactor killed her.

06:07.192 --> 06:09.369
GIL:
What's the profile here?

06:10.587 --> 06:12.067
Pleasure seeker, maybe?

06:12.110 --> 06:15.853
Some type of thrill killer?

06:15.897 --> 06:19.422
Actually... he may be
avoiding the thrill.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.294
The way he disposed
of the bodies.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.861
Impersonal. Remote.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.734
He killed them with a machine.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.170
Didn't have to bury them.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.825
Why?
Helped him disassociate.

06:30.868 --> 06:33.393
I bet he couldn't
actually watch.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.438
It's a coping mechanism.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.831
He had to see them
as inanimate objects

06:36.874 --> 06:39.094
-in order to kill them.
-EDRISA: Fascinating.

06:39.137 --> 06:42.314
So that makes him the opposite
of someone like The Surgeon,

06:42.358 --> 06:43.620
who seemed to derive pleasure

06:43.664 --> 06:45.709
from direct contact
with the human body.

06:45.753 --> 06:48.190
True. But just because this guy
had a different M.O.

06:48.233 --> 06:49.713
from my father
doesn't mean that Dr. Whitly

06:49.757 --> 06:50.932
isn't somehow involved.

06:50.975 --> 06:53.717
Or so I've been telling
Gil all morning.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.937
Ugh. [chuckles]
You should listen to him.

06:57.025 --> 07:00.724
Or not. Up to you.
[chuckles]

07:00.768 --> 07:02.726
Did the lab find anything
in the station wagon

07:02.770 --> 07:04.772
that might help
connect the dots?

07:04.815 --> 07:05.729
Yes.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.688
Uh, they did a full workup.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.473
The blood in the trunk

07:10.517 --> 07:13.911
does not match any
of the junkyard victims.

07:13.955 --> 07:17.437
Or any of The Surgeon's
victims, either.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.961
Oh...

07:20.004 --> 07:22.093
So they didn't find
any connection?

07:22.137 --> 07:23.965
My "yes" was perhaps
tooenthusiastic?

07:24.008 --> 07:24.748
[door opens]

07:24.792 --> 07:26.141
[stretcher rolling]

07:27.359 --> 07:29.753
-Another one?
-Real fresh, too.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.452
Probably killed
in the last week.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.411
GIL [sighs]:
That makes eight now.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.807
Bright, it's time we say
what we haven't been saying.

07:40.982 --> 07:43.114
We have a new serial killer
on our hands.

07:43.158 --> 07:44.333
He's not new.

07:44.376 --> 07:47.162
He's been killing for years.
On my watch.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.471
That ends now.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.221
Will you remember
to tilt the camera down?

08:03.265 --> 08:05.528
I want to make sure
that people see the red line.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.138
Yeah.

08:07.182 --> 08:09.184
You know, if you want
the best angle,

08:09.227 --> 08:11.316
-we could probably
untether him...
-Mm.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.796
No. No.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.495
The cable screams
"serial killer,"

08:15.538 --> 08:16.931
and that's what we want.

08:16.974 --> 08:19.629
Oh, and I sent
hair and makeup home.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.892
I know Lesley wanted us
to give him a once-over,

08:21.936 --> 08:24.504
but there is no way
I'm making him look good.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.636
You've thought this through.

08:26.680 --> 08:30.292
[chuckling]: Every inch,
in my sleep, for the last week.

08:30.335 --> 08:33.469
We're going to show
the real Martin Whitly

08:33.513 --> 08:34.862
even if it kills us.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.866
You know what I mean.
[chuckles]

08:38.909 --> 08:40.258
I do.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.130
And you're amazing.

08:42.173 --> 08:44.219
But this is intense.

08:44.262 --> 08:47.178
So if at any point,
you want to leave, we can.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.529
Okay? It is a little early

08:49.572 --> 08:52.357
-in our relationship
to meet your parents.
-[chuckles] Okay.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.838
TEVIN:
Ainsley Whitly!

08:54.882 --> 08:57.841
It's Ainsley Whitly from the TV.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.364
GUARD:
All right, Tevin, come on now.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.541
-All right.
-TEVIN: But I have
so much to say!

09:01.584 --> 09:03.325
On the TV, Ainsley!

09:03.368 --> 09:05.370
-GUARD: Come on, now.
-But I want to be on TV!

09:05.414 --> 09:07.198
[grunts]

09:07.242 --> 09:08.939
Ainsley!

09:10.506 --> 09:11.812
[door slams in distance]

09:12.639 --> 09:14.466
I'm fine.

09:14.510 --> 09:15.729
I'm ready.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.819
Let's bring him in.

09:24.607 --> 09:28.045
Our body count
is up to nine now.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.395
And we have another I.D.
Haley Wyatt.

09:30.439 --> 09:34.008
Star student at Bronx Science
until she got hooked on heroin.

09:34.051 --> 09:36.576
Had been trying to get clean
for a while.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.012
They're all from the Bronx
so far?

09:38.055 --> 09:40.405
Seems a little dumb
to be killing so close to home.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.756
BRIGHT: Which may mean
he's an organized killer.

09:42.799 --> 09:45.628
They're meticulous planners,
which allows them

09:45.672 --> 09:47.282
to live and work
in the same place they hunt.

09:47.325 --> 09:52.069
Then again, organized killers
usually murder in one location

09:52.113 --> 09:54.245
and ditch the body in another.

09:54.289 --> 09:56.813
That's not this guy.

09:56.857 --> 09:59.511
Which makes that profile
completely worthless.

09:59.555 --> 10:00.948
So...

10:02.297 --> 10:03.603
You okay, bro?

10:05.779 --> 10:07.389
It's not like it's a science.

10:07.432 --> 10:10.000
I thought it literally
was a science.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.309
What? Didn't he tell us that on,
like, the first day?

10:15.223 --> 10:16.833
[sighs]

10:16.877 --> 10:20.097
Bright, you can take some time
with this. I know it's personal.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.186
Is it?

10:22.230 --> 10:24.406
-I don't even know anymore.
-Well, it's personal for me.

10:24.449 --> 10:26.582
If this guy is killing people
from the Bronx,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.932
-then I'm pissed at him
enough for all of us.
-GIL: Good.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.151
Okay, at least
we've narrowed down

10:30.194 --> 10:32.196
-his hunting ground.
-Not really.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.763
I mean, the Bronx is, like,
40 square miles,

10:33.807 --> 10:35.156
and, like, 50 neighborhoods.

10:35.199 --> 10:36.679
People always refer to the Bronx
like it's just

10:36.723 --> 10:38.072
this one place,
but it's actually

10:38.115 --> 10:40.422
all of these other things
instead...

10:40.465 --> 10:43.817
I am, uh, taking this
personally, so...

10:43.860 --> 10:46.820
Oh. I get it.
It's your hood.

10:46.863 --> 10:49.170
Don't.
Please don't say "hood."

10:51.825 --> 10:53.696
Okay, so, who's he targeting?

10:53.740 --> 10:55.089
Out of the victims
we know about,

10:55.132 --> 10:57.569
two were drug addicts,
one was homeless;

10:57.613 --> 10:58.962
seems like he's killing people

10:59.006 --> 11:00.921
when they're at
their most vulnerable.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.313
I'll start my profile there.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.924
JT:
We'll check
all the local shelters,

11:03.967 --> 11:05.577
-clinics, needle exchanges...
-Hey, Bright.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.579
Hey.

11:07.623 --> 11:08.885
GIL:
Run it down.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.194
Excuse me.

11:13.237 --> 11:16.110
I know the focus
is on the new bodies,

11:16.153 --> 11:18.721
but we did another pass
on the station wagon,

11:18.765 --> 11:20.680
and you said to call you
if we found anything.

11:20.723 --> 11:23.117
Oh, I guess
I should have called.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.467
[chuckles] It's okay. I'm glad
you came. What do you have?

11:25.510 --> 11:26.947
Oh. This.

11:26.990 --> 11:29.732
It was hidden in a crack
in the center console.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.691
It seemed important.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.214
What is it, a pocketknife?

11:44.747 --> 11:46.923
What was that?

11:47.794 --> 11:49.404
Are you, are you okay?

11:52.407 --> 11:54.844
No.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.542
There's only one person
who can tell me why.

11:57.586 --> 12:00.458
Are we sure I don't need
a little concealer?

12:00.502 --> 12:02.765
Just maybe under the eyes? Hmm?

12:02.809 --> 12:04.636
Sleep wasn't my friend
last night.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.160
I was too excited about this.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.510
You look fine. Are we ready?

12:09.554 --> 12:10.773
MARTIN:
Out of curiosity,

12:10.817 --> 12:12.775
w-which question
are you starting with?

12:12.819 --> 12:14.777
-Uh, the one about...
-Billy Franklin.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.257
Age 23.

12:16.300 --> 12:20.652
Aced his LSATs, wanted to become
a civil rights lawyer.

12:20.696 --> 12:24.656
You removed his heart to see how
long he could live without it.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.572
He died a gruesome,
agonizing death.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.574
My question is: why?

12:29.618 --> 12:31.228
Why did you do that?

12:34.101 --> 12:36.233
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

12:36.277 --> 12:40.934
Or does that just make you think
of Abby Conway, age 30?

12:40.977 --> 12:42.762
Why did you remove her tongue?

12:42.805 --> 12:46.678
Or maybe you prefer to talk
about Megan Wong, age 64.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.768
How about Cory Goldstein,
age ten?

12:49.943 --> 12:51.248
A brutal car accident

12:51.292 --> 12:54.121
left him with a surely fatal
aortic rupture.

12:54.164 --> 12:58.081
U-Until he landed in my OR,
where I saved his life.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.083
You know, his, uh,

13:00.127 --> 13:03.913
his parents called me
his guardian angel on live TV.

13:03.957 --> 13:06.960
And then they found out
that you were a murderer.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.573
I'm not a perfect man.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.140
It's true.

13:13.183 --> 13:16.099
I'm in a psychiatric hospital,
after all.

13:16.143 --> 13:19.537
And sadly, the lamentable stigma
that still plagues people

13:19.581 --> 13:21.365
with mental health diagnoses...

13:21.409 --> 13:24.107
-I hardly think that this...
-I-I was, I was sick.
I was sick.

13:24.151 --> 13:26.109
My brain was diseased.

13:26.153 --> 13:30.548
Now, that diagnosis
is as real as cancer or lupus.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.115
Please, let me, let me finish.

13:32.159 --> 13:35.989
Um, what consoles me

13:36.032 --> 13:38.948
in the darkest of nights,

13:38.992 --> 13:41.951
is that as a doctor,

13:41.995 --> 13:45.128
I saved thousands of lives.

13:45.172 --> 13:48.436
So if we're judging
the moral worth of a person

13:48.479 --> 13:50.873
based on the mark
they leave on the world,

13:50.917 --> 13:54.529
mine is a-a net positive.

13:54.572 --> 13:57.967
I mean, by a lot.
How many people can say that?

13:59.360 --> 14:02.102
Now, you're very good
at your job, sweetheart.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.147
Your mother and I
couldn't be prouder.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.888
But have you ever
saved someone's life?

14:05.932 --> 14:07.585
-This isn't about me.
-No.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.370
No, uh, it's about legacy.

14:09.413 --> 14:13.722
Did you know that they named
a medical procedure after me?

14:13.765 --> 14:16.681
I developed a novel technique
for decreasing

14:16.725 --> 14:19.206
the amount of time required
in cardiopulmonary perfusion

14:19.249 --> 14:21.686
dur-- oh, goodness,
listen to me going on.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.688
I'm sorry. Uh, the point is,

14:23.732 --> 14:25.995
they may have changed
the official name

14:26.039 --> 14:29.129
after all the hullabaloo,

14:29.172 --> 14:32.393
but... I mean,
I've heard a rumor

14:32.436 --> 14:34.830
that doctors still call it
"The Whitly"

14:34.874 --> 14:38.007
in hospitals around the world.

14:38.051 --> 14:41.010
And isn't-isn't that
what counts?

14:41.054 --> 14:45.232
That in the end,
I did some good?

14:49.410 --> 14:51.064
[knocking on door]

14:54.589 --> 14:56.025
[exhales]

14:56.765 --> 14:57.897
Let's just...

14:57.940 --> 15:00.595
-Let's take five.
-Of course.

15:00.638 --> 15:01.901
[lock buzzes]

15:03.598 --> 15:05.905
[keys jangle, latch clicks]

15:07.602 --> 15:09.038
AINSLEY:
What are you doing here?

15:09.082 --> 15:10.605
You promised
you wouldn't interfere.

15:10.648 --> 15:12.346
BRIGHT:
Sorry, I know
this is your big day,

15:12.389 --> 15:13.956
but we have a serial killer
on our hands.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.305
-You think?
-No, not that one.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.003
A new one. An active one.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.614
He's out there somewhere, and
I think he's connected to Dad,

15:19.657 --> 15:21.877
and I have...

15:21.921 --> 15:23.444
-I have to talk to him.
-Okay, I get it.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.228
It's not like it was going
all that well in there anyway.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.577
I'm getting nowhere.

15:26.621 --> 15:29.493
He's just twisting
everything I'm saying,

15:29.537 --> 15:31.321
-and it is driving me crazy...
-Crazy.

15:31.365 --> 15:33.802
Yeah, welcome to my world.

15:33.845 --> 15:36.413
I need some answers, Ains.

15:39.025 --> 15:39.982
Okay, fine.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.505
But I'm staying.

15:41.549 --> 15:45.031
I'll turn the cameras off,
but I'm staying.

15:47.903 --> 15:49.557
[lock buzzes]

15:52.038 --> 15:54.562
MARTIN [laughs]:
Well,

15:54.605 --> 15:55.998
as I live and breathe!

15:56.042 --> 15:58.392
We got ourselves
a family reunion.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.089
AINSLEY:
We're gonna take a quick break
so the authorities

16:00.133 --> 16:02.352
can ask some questions
about a case.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.573
A serial killer, actually.

16:05.616 --> 16:07.792
Ooh, exciting.

16:07.836 --> 16:09.794
Have they named him yet?

16:09.838 --> 16:12.754
I always thought The Surgeon
was a little on the nose.

16:12.797 --> 16:15.104
But... it's not about me.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.671
BRIGHT:
It is about you.

16:16.714 --> 16:19.587
Your station wagon,
specifically.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.025
The camping wagon.

16:23.069 --> 16:26.028
Oh, good for you. Where was it?

16:26.072 --> 16:28.030
A junkyard in the Bronx,

16:28.074 --> 16:29.989
where we also found
ten dead bodies.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.687
Never been to the Bronx.

16:32.730 --> 16:37.692
And if you like me for the
murders, well, what can I say?

16:37.735 --> 16:40.303
[chuckles]:
I've been indisposed.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.784
BRIGHT:
We know you didn't kill them.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.220
But we think you know who did.

16:44.264 --> 16:47.571
Oh. Cars can show up
in all sorts of places, Malcolm.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.138
BRIGHT:
Oh, so it was
just a coincidence?

16:49.182 --> 16:51.184
One serial killer's car is found

16:51.227 --> 16:53.186
in the junkyard
of another serial killer.

16:53.229 --> 16:56.928
-What are the odds?
-Well, not great, but let's see.

16:56.972 --> 16:59.148
There are usually
between 25 to 50

16:59.192 --> 17:01.672
active serial killers
for about...

17:01.716 --> 17:03.022
Stop.

17:03.065 --> 17:05.676
Stop. I know they're connected.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.331
This knife was found

17:08.375 --> 17:10.986
in the center console
of the station wagon.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.335
Don't tell me
you don't remember.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.120
Sure, that was your knife.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.473
Yeah, we got that in the, uh,
rest stop just off the turnpike.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.562
And I know what you're thinking:
"What kind of rest stop

17:21.605 --> 17:25.087
would sell a switchblade
to a kid?"

17:25.131 --> 17:26.741
It was New Jersey.

17:28.221 --> 17:29.918
And you were never one
to crush a penny.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.268
You wanted a practical souvenir.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.227
Is that really why I wanted it?

17:38.013 --> 17:41.364
Why else would a boy
want a knife?

17:41.408 --> 17:44.237
To whittle a piece of wood.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.369
Scale a fish.

17:46.413 --> 17:49.851
And on our camping trip,

17:49.894 --> 17:52.288
what happened there, Dr. Whitly?

18:01.167 --> 18:03.604
Perhaps we better
table this for now.

18:05.693 --> 18:09.349
Seems like you're taking up
all your sister's time.

18:09.392 --> 18:12.743
There's only so much of Dad
to go around.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.228
Malcolm?

18:19.272 --> 18:23.232
Can I... can I talk to you
for a second?

18:26.235 --> 18:27.454
[quietly]:
Yeah.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.456
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

18:31.153 --> 18:32.763
[door closes]

18:32.807 --> 18:36.158
He knows something, I just don't
have a way to get it out of him.

18:36.202 --> 18:39.379
Hold on.
I think we should team up.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.946
Seeing the way he is with you,
i-it gave me an idea

18:41.990 --> 18:44.079
of how to finally get him
on the defensive.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.602
I have a case to solve, Ains.

18:45.646 --> 18:48.431
Yes, but that is not the case
you're talking about.

18:48.475 --> 18:51.130
That is some next-level
childhood drama

18:51.173 --> 18:53.219
that I'm not touching
with a ten-foot fishing pole,

18:53.262 --> 18:54.568
and it sounds like
you shouldn't, either.

18:54.611 --> 18:57.223
Come on, let me tap back in.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.615
You're practically bouncing.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.182
Should I start playing
the Rockymusic?

19:00.226 --> 19:03.316
No, not yet.
Just... trust me, okay?

19:03.359 --> 19:06.623
Stand right behind me,
in his sight line.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.147
Okay.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.410
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

19:10.453 --> 19:13.282
[door opens, closes]

19:13.326 --> 19:16.372
[keys jangle, latch clicks]

19:20.202 --> 19:21.725
AINSLEY:
So,

19:21.769 --> 19:23.727
I mentioned a number
of your victims earlier,

19:23.771 --> 19:25.686
but I'd like to discuss
one more.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.429
Malcolm. Malcolm Whitly.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.083
I'm not sure I understand.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.650
You claim to care
about your son,

19:33.694 --> 19:38.438
yet what you did 20 years ago
harmed him irreparably.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.745
-Well, that's not true.
-Isn't it?

19:41.789 --> 19:44.661
He's been diagnosed
with complex PTSD,

19:44.705 --> 19:47.186
generalized anxiety disorder,
night terrors.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.057
Dr. Whitly,

19:49.100 --> 19:52.713
do you know what happens to the
human body when it withstands

19:52.756 --> 19:55.281
that much stress
for that long a period of time?

19:55.324 --> 19:56.804
I'm-I'm not sure
that's relevant.

19:56.847 --> 19:59.502
He was fired from the only job
he was ever good at.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.504
He hasn't been in a stable
relationship in years.

20:01.548 --> 20:02.940
And the ten years he went
without seeing you

20:02.984 --> 20:06.770
were by far the happiest,
healthiest of his life.

20:06.814 --> 20:08.468
-Well, that's absolutely not...
-What could that say about you,

20:08.511 --> 20:11.340
except that you are
an absolutely terrible father?

20:11.384 --> 20:12.907
-I'm not. I...
-He just wanted to love you,

20:12.950 --> 20:15.039
-and you caused him
so much pain.
-Stop it.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.259
-What kind of a father
does that?
-Stop it!

20:17.303 --> 20:19.043
I was a good father, damn it!

20:19.087 --> 20:20.175
[gasps]

20:20.219 --> 20:21.524
-Martin.
-You say that again.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.352
Say I was a terrible father!

20:23.396 --> 20:24.701
Don't take another step.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.486
[panting]

20:28.575 --> 20:31.099
-JIN: Ains, are you all right?
-Yeah.

20:31.142 --> 20:33.754
-[quietly]:
Did you get that? Good.
-On camera? Yeah.

20:38.062 --> 20:39.368
Good.

20:41.196 --> 20:43.285
[laughs]

20:43.329 --> 20:45.505
You had a plan.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.986
Yeah, it's good to have a plan.

20:50.161 --> 20:52.338
[alarm sounding]

21:10.225 --> 21:11.792
Ainsley.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.189
I'll admit, when you said
you were locked up,

21:18.233 --> 21:20.540
-I got a little worried it was
for inpatient treatment.
-Don't rule it out.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.193
How's our case going?

21:22.237 --> 21:24.805
We're fine over here.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.286
You're not fine, actually.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.766
I just talked to the warden.
A patient stabbed his therapist

21:29.810 --> 21:31.333
and locked the guards
out of the East Wing.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.595
He's got a knife.

21:32.639 --> 21:35.424
What do we know about this guy?

21:35.468 --> 21:37.339
DANI:
Tevin Standish, 32 years old,

21:37.383 --> 21:38.862
pled insanity.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.342
He's been in there
for 15 years already.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.126
-For what?
-Killing both his parents.

the problem is the hemothorax.

because of the excess blood.

26:47.301 --> 26:49.433
You see the way
his trachea is shifted?

26:49.477 --> 26:51.610
That means the blood has already
filled the pleural cavity.

he's gonna die.

He was wheezing before,

isn't expanding.
