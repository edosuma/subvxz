WEBVTT

00:12.999 --> 00:13.999
- Coming up,
it's part two

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
of the
"Vanderpump Rules Reunion."

00:16.999 --> 00:19.999
- Imagine if Ariana had spoken
to your mother

00:19.999 --> 00:20.999
about your problem.

00:20.999 --> 00:21.999
- It's severely backstabbing.

00:21.999 --> 00:24.999
- You were being a dick.

00:24.999 --> 00:25.999
- Every time
my name is mentioned,

00:25.999 --> 00:28.999
it's like a f***ing bomb
was just dropped on your lap.

00:28.999 --> 00:30.999
- This is the most
toxic environment

00:30.999 --> 00:33.999
I've ever witnessed in my life.

00:33.999 --> 00:34.999
- Why with a bunch of couples,

00:34.999 --> 00:36.999
you're like, "Now would be
the time to take my top off."

00:36.999 --> 00:39.999
- Every day is a good time
to take your top off.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.999
- So you double down
on your lies?

00:41.999 --> 00:43.999
- I've got to sell the story.

00:43.999 --> 00:45.999
- I was moving and changing
my entire life for this man.

00:45.999 --> 00:47.999
I just wanted to know
what was actually going on.

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
- Where are my feelings in this?

00:49.999 --> 00:51.999
Way down on the f***ing bottom.

00:51.999 --> 00:53.999
I'm trying to make
a f***ing point.

00:53.999 --> 00:55.999
- I've been to therapy,
and I've changed,

00:55.999 --> 00:56.999
and I've become a better person.

00:56.999 --> 00:57.999
- Being in the same room
with him right now

00:57.999 --> 00:58.999
is making my skin crawl.

00:58.999 --> 00:59.999
- Oh, shut up, Kristen.

00:59.999 --> 01:00.999
You don't know
anything about it.

01:00.999 --> 01:02.999
- Don't say "shut up."

01:02.999 --> 01:03.999
- Yes, shut up.

01:03.999 --> 01:06.999
Do you still think right now
that I've done nothing for you?

01:06.999 --> 01:08.999
- I've made some mistakes.

01:08.999 --> 01:10.999
- As soon
as the cameras were on you,

01:10.999 --> 01:12.999
you trashed me again.

01:12.999 --> 01:16.999
- ♪ Just raise
your glasses high ♪

01:16.999 --> 01:19.999
♪ This one's
for you tonight ♪

01:19.999 --> 01:21.999
- Let's talk about Gay Pride.

01:21.999 --> 01:22.999
You came into Pump...

01:22.999 --> 01:24.999
- That's a good day,
good, fun day.

01:24.999 --> 01:27.999
- Sporting battle scars
from the boudoir.

01:27.999 --> 01:31.999
It looked like you had
gone from playful

01:31.999 --> 01:34.999
nibbling to someone
chewing on your heart.

01:34.999 --> 01:37.999
Just Hannibal Lecter territory.

01:37.999 --> 01:39.999
- What the hell happened
to your arms and everything?

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
What's all this?
Turn around.

01:41.999 --> 01:43.999
What the hell is that?

01:48.999 --> 01:49.999
- If he was gonna
come into work,

01:49.999 --> 01:51.999
he could've worn
a T-shirt or a shirt.

01:51.999 --> 01:53.999
- Every single person
had tank tops on, though.

01:53.999 --> 01:54.999
- Yeah,
but when you're covered in scars

01:54.999 --> 01:56.999
and bites like that,
you don't have to.

01:56.999 --> 01:57.999
- I was just wearing the uniform
that you gave me.

01:57.999 --> 01:59.999
- You were being provocative,
and you were putting it

01:59.999 --> 02:01.999
out there,
and he was, like, instigating.

02:01.999 --> 02:02.999
"Oh, what happened
to you, James?"

02:02.999 --> 02:04.999
There's a reason
doing things like that.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.999
There's a reason behind it.

02:06.999 --> 02:09.999
- Lala, you don't seem
to be kind of a prude,

02:09.999 --> 02:12.999
but why were you so upset when
you saw the bites and scars?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.999
- What the?

02:15.999 --> 02:18.999
I just want to literally
f***ing scalp you right now.

02:18.999 --> 02:20.999
Get out of my face.

02:20.999 --> 02:23.000
I kind of felt like,
okay, you're deliberately

02:23.999 --> 02:25.999
trying to embarrass me
and disrespect me,

02:25.999 --> 02:27.999
and that's where
I will draw the line.

02:27.999 --> 02:29.999
Even though I don't have want
to have sex with you,

02:29.999 --> 02:30.999
I'm like--but I don't want
to know

02:30.999 --> 02:31.999
about who you're sleeping with.

02:31.999 --> 02:33.999
- Kristen,
did you ever chew on James?

02:33.999 --> 02:35.999
- I wouldn't say "chew,"
necessarily.

02:35.999 --> 02:37.999
- Put cigarettes out on you?

02:37.999 --> 02:40.000
- James, you fool around
the night before with this girl.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.999
Did you not think that Lala
was gonna find out?

02:43.999 --> 02:45.999
- Oh, no.
I knew she was gonna find out.

02:45.999 --> 02:46.999
Yeah.
- You did?

02:46.999 --> 02:48.000
- But that's what's shady
about it is, it was like

02:48.999 --> 02:49.999
he wanted
to get a rise out of me,

02:49.999 --> 02:50.999
and then on top
of it being Lauren,

02:50.999 --> 02:52.999
who I'm literally confiding in.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.999
- Who were you with?

03:01.999 --> 03:03.000
- Lauren,
that girl that you were just

03:03.999 --> 03:04.999
standing with at the hotel.

03:11.999 --> 03:13.999
You shady chick.

03:13.999 --> 03:14.999
Like, is this real?

03:14.999 --> 03:16.999
Like, what's happening
in your head right now?

03:16.999 --> 03:19.999
- So how are things
with you and Lauren now?

03:19.999 --> 03:20.999
- Great.
- Great?

03:20.999 --> 03:21.999
- Yeah, she apologized.

03:21.999 --> 03:23.999
- What about Lauren and Anthony?
It was over, right?

03:23.999 --> 03:25.999
- Oh, that was over that day.

03:25.999 --> 03:29.999
- The marks on James
are from--she f***ed him.

03:30.999 --> 03:32.999
- No, I swear to God.

03:32.999 --> 03:34.999
- How did Anthony not beat
the crap out of you that day?

03:34.999 --> 03:37.999
- He tried.
- He tried. He went up to Pump.

03:37.999 --> 03:38.999
- I was like, "Run, James."

03:38.999 --> 03:40.999
- This is what I have
to deal with.

03:40.999 --> 03:42.999
Do you see what I'm saying?

03:42.999 --> 03:43.999
It's like a ripple effect.

03:43.999 --> 03:45.999
- Jax, it looked
like you and Lala

03:45.999 --> 03:48.999
were gonna get it after
Gay Pride, but you didn't.

03:48.999 --> 03:49.999
What happened?

03:56.999 --> 03:59.999
- You know, it was just fun;
it was just fun to just,

03:59.999 --> 04:00.999
like, tease the idea.

04:00.999 --> 04:01.999
- Yeah.

04:01.999 --> 04:02.999
- But we never
ever ever went there.

04:02.999 --> 04:04.999
- James, did your rivalry
with Jax

04:04.999 --> 04:07.999
have anything to do
with your pursuit of Lala?

04:07.999 --> 04:08.999
- Uh, no.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.999
- Dude, that's when you guys
first started--

04:10.999 --> 04:11.999
- Beefing.
- Oh, really?

04:11.999 --> 04:12.999
- Beefing is right then.

04:12.999 --> 04:14.999
- The other day,
I was just talking to Lala.

04:14.999 --> 04:15.999
You don't need to get up
in there and be like,

04:15.999 --> 04:17.999
"Yo, yo, yo.
What's going on? What's going--"

04:17.999 --> 04:18.999
- I apologize about that.
- I'm an adult.

04:18.999 --> 04:19.999
I was having a drink,
and you're like, "I bought that

04:19.999 --> 04:21.999
for Lala;
where's Brittney?"

04:21.999 --> 04:22.999
- I'm sorry; I felt, like--just,
like, a little bit weirded out.

04:22.999 --> 04:24.999
- I'm not--dude...

04:24.999 --> 04:25.999
- James wants to be
just like Jax.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.999
He wants to be like Jax
where, like,

04:28.999 --> 04:29.999
Jax thinks he's the number
one guy in the group.

04:29.999 --> 04:31.999
Like, everyone's
friends with Jax

04:31.999 --> 04:32.999
even if he makes mistakes.

04:32.999 --> 04:35.999
- In a group of people
with massive egos,

04:35.999 --> 04:36.999
the two of you are maybe
at the top.

04:36.999 --> 04:37.999
- Can I please intervene?

04:37.999 --> 04:40.999
If you're saying to me, Kristen,
that I want to be Jax,

04:40.999 --> 04:41.999
that honestly embarrasses me.

04:41.999 --> 04:43.999
- That's not my problem.

04:43.999 --> 04:45.999
- By the time I'm, you know,
38, 39, however old you are,

04:45.999 --> 04:47.999
I do not want to be in the same
position that you're in.

04:47.999 --> 04:48.999
- He's not 38 or 39.

04:48.999 --> 04:50.999
- You're instigating right now.
- Yes.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.999
- I don't think
that James wants to be like Jax,

04:52.999 --> 04:55.999
but I just think
that they are very much alike.

04:55.999 --> 04:57.999
- Jax, does it bother you
that he's 24

04:57.999 --> 04:58.999
and he's saying
that he's your age?

04:58.999 --> 04:59.999
- No, I don't care about that.

04:59.999 --> 05:00.999
I had a great time
in my 20s.

05:00.999 --> 05:01.999
I'm still having
a great time now.

05:01.999 --> 05:03.999
I don't care that I'm old.

05:05.999 --> 05:07.999
- That's good.

05:07.999 --> 05:08.999
- I want to talk about one
of the most romantic moments

05:09.000 --> 05:11.999
of the season,
Tom Schwartz,

05:11.999 --> 05:14.999
your proposal,
flawlessly executed.

05:14.999 --> 05:17.999
After all you've put
Katie through,

05:17.999 --> 05:21.999
you couldn't just the knee
and give the girl a ring?

05:21.999 --> 05:24.999
- I really, truly wanted Katie
to abandon all hope.

05:24.999 --> 05:26.999
- He likes to antagonize me.
- I do.

05:26.999 --> 05:27.999
- Lisa,
you thought that the plan

05:27.999 --> 05:29.999
was fraught with issues.

05:29.999 --> 05:31.999
- Yeah, I thought
it was precarious, you know?

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
She's waited so long

05:33.999 --> 05:35.999
and had this beautiful ring,
and he's just like, "No, no, no.

05:35.999 --> 05:36.999
I got it.
I got it."

05:36.999 --> 05:38.999
- I'm gonna blindside her.
- I don't think so.

05:38.999 --> 05:40.999
- Wait, wait, wait.

05:40.999 --> 05:41.999
This will be--this will
be a blip.

05:41.999 --> 05:43.999
Trust me;
it's gonna be super romantic.

05:43.999 --> 05:45.999
All right, ready?
- Yeah.

05:49.999 --> 05:50.999
- Oh, it's gorgeous.

05:50.999 --> 05:53.999
- I feel like I've finally
done something right.

05:53.999 --> 05:55.999
- Was it everything
you hoped for, Katie?

05:55.999 --> 05:56.999
- Honestly, yes.

05:56.999 --> 05:57.999
I didn't want him to do
some kind of cliché,

05:57.999 --> 05:59.999
Hallmark kind of thing.

05:59.999 --> 06:02.999
I wanted it to be just, like,
what I would expect from him.

06:02.999 --> 06:05.999
- Will you marry me?
- You know what, actually?

06:05.999 --> 06:08.999
Actually, you guys--
guys, guys, guys, guy,

06:08.999 --> 06:11.999
can I take over?

06:11.999 --> 06:13.999
Katie Maloney...

06:13.999 --> 06:15.999
- No, you're not.
- Ahh!

06:15.999 --> 06:16.999
- Will you marry me?

06:16.999 --> 06:18.999
- Oh, my...

06:18.999 --> 06:20.999
- Of course.

06:20.999 --> 06:22.999
- If he hadn't done it then,

06:22.999 --> 06:24.999
how much longer
did he really have?

06:24.999 --> 06:25.999
- I was wearing thin.

06:25.999 --> 06:27.999
It was just like, "Come on."

06:27.999 --> 06:30.999
- Schwartz, you had some other
crazy ideas

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
for proposals, right?

06:32.999 --> 06:33.999
- He had an idea
of doing it at Sur.

06:33.999 --> 06:34.999
- Wow.
- Oh, no.

06:34.999 --> 06:36.999
- I know.

06:36.999 --> 06:37.999
- And I just remember shouting
across the apartment.

06:37.999 --> 06:39.000
I was like,
"Not at Sur!"

06:39.999 --> 06:41.999
I was like,
"Sur will forever be,

06:41.999 --> 06:44.999
like, tied to this memory
in your life."

06:44.999 --> 06:45.999
- Like, while I'm working,

06:45.999 --> 06:48.999
like, I'm in
the purple dress, and he--no.

06:48.999 --> 06:50.999
- I just told him, I said,
"Make sure she looks pretty.

06:50.999 --> 06:52.999
"Make sure she feels pretty.

06:52.999 --> 06:54.999
Make sure her hair,
her makeup, her nails."

06:54.999 --> 06:56.999
- I never even
thought about that.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.999
- Happy that Katie
finally got what she wanted?

06:58.999 --> 07:00.999
- Oh, thrilled for her, yeah.

07:00.999 --> 07:02.999
- Katie, you got
what you wanted,

07:02.999 --> 07:06.999
then there was
a major sex drought.

07:06.999 --> 07:09.999
It took a while for the
engagement to be consummated.

07:09.999 --> 07:12.999
To be clear, when was
it consummated to completion?

07:12.999 --> 07:14.999
Was it weeks?
That week?

07:14.999 --> 07:15.999
- No, it wasn't weeks.

07:15.999 --> 07:17.999
- We should've technically
had sex that night,

07:17.999 --> 07:20.999
but I went to put taquitos in
the oven, and you passed out--

07:20.999 --> 07:23.999
- And by "taquitos in the oven,"
you mean.

07:23.999 --> 07:26.999
- It was, like, 2 1/2 weeks.
- I don't know.

07:26.999 --> 07:27.999
- So you've been together
for how long?

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
- Like, 5 1/2 or 6 years.
- 5 1/2 years.

07:29.999 --> 07:31.999
How often do you have sex,
would you say?

07:31.999 --> 07:33.999
- Andy.
- Well...

07:33.999 --> 07:36.999
- Well, lately we've been
slacking in that department.

07:36.999 --> 07:37.999
- As much as we feel
like we need to.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.999
It's not like--
we're not the most, like, horny,

07:39.999 --> 07:40.999
like, people.

07:40.999 --> 07:43.999
We're not trying to, like--
- We're not not horny, but...

07:43.999 --> 07:44.999
You remember my asexual phase?

07:44.999 --> 07:46.999
- Yeah, we thought
he was asexual for a while.

07:46.999 --> 07:47.999
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:47.999 --> 07:51.999
- Schwartz,
did what Scheana and Shay

07:51.999 --> 07:53.999
went through in their first year

07:53.999 --> 07:56.999
give you any cause for pause
about taking the leap?

07:56.999 --> 07:57.999
- Honestly, sincerely,
if anything,

07:57.999 --> 08:00.999
I think it was kind of
an inspiration.

08:00.999 --> 08:02.999
They went through hell,
they worked through it,

08:02.999 --> 08:04.999
and they came out
stronger than ever.

08:04.999 --> 08:06.999
I feel like our relationship
has almost worked in reverse,

08:06.999 --> 08:08.999
because usually,
it starts really good,

08:08.999 --> 08:09.999
and then it just goes to hell,

08:09.999 --> 08:12.999
and I feel like ours kind of--
it didn't start off as hell,

08:12.999 --> 08:13.999
but it was very tumultuous...

08:13.999 --> 08:15.999
- It was a struggle.
- And it was not really good.

08:15.999 --> 08:18.999
I mean, there was many times--
we almost broke up a few times,

08:18.999 --> 08:19.999
and it kind of sucked
in the beginning,

08:19.999 --> 08:21.999
and now I feel like
it's amazing,

08:21.999 --> 08:22.999
and it keeps getting
better and better.

08:22.999 --> 08:24.999
- It makes me wonder
when the two of you

08:24.999 --> 08:25.999
are gonna get married.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.999
- Ariana doesn't want to.

08:27.999 --> 08:29.999
- You don't want to get married?

08:29.999 --> 08:30.999
- No, not really.
- You don't?

08:30.999 --> 08:32.999
- No.

08:32.999 --> 08:33.999
- Is that a relief to you?

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
- It's like a reverse
psychology thing now.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
All of a sudden, like,
I'm like, "Well, why?"

08:37.999 --> 08:39.999
- Right.
- Yeah.

08:39.999 --> 08:41.999
- Well, Katie and Schwartz
were not the only couple

08:41.999 --> 08:43.999
to take major steps this year.

08:43.999 --> 08:47.999
Jax moved Brittney
out from Kentucky.

08:47.999 --> 08:52.999
He got her a new set of boobs,
a job at Hooters.

08:52.999 --> 08:55.999
When we come back,
Brittney is joining the fun.

08:55.999 --> 08:57.999
We'll be right back.

08:57.999 --> 09:00.999
- Brittney.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.999
Did you Google him or anything?

09:03.999 --> 09:05.999
- Nope.
- He has a horrible reputation.

09:05.999 --> 09:07.999
- Yeah,
and these girls told me too.

09:07.999 --> 09:08.999
- She just seems too sweet
for him.

09:18.999 --> 09:19.999
- We are back at Sur

09:19.999 --> 09:21.999
in West Hollywood

09:21.999 --> 09:22.999
for the
"Vanderpump Rules Reunion."

09:22.999 --> 09:24.999
I'm Andy Cohen.

09:24.999 --> 09:28.999
Joining me all the way
from Kentucky is Brittney.

09:28.999 --> 09:29.999
Hi, Brittney.
- Hi.

09:29.999 --> 09:31.999
- How's it going?
- Great, thank you.

09:31.999 --> 09:33.999
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

09:33.999 --> 09:37.999
- In a non-creepy way,
your boobs look very nice.

09:37.999 --> 09:38.999
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
Are you happy with them?
- Yeah.

09:40.999 --> 09:42.999
- Had you watched
Vanderpump Rules?

09:42.999 --> 09:43.999
No?

09:43.999 --> 09:46.999
- The only person
I knew would be Lisa.

09:46.999 --> 09:47.999
- 'Cause you watch
the "Housewives?"

09:47.999 --> 09:48.999
- 'Cause I'd seen her
on the "Housewives," yeah.

09:48.999 --> 09:51.999
- But when you started
dating Jax,

09:51.999 --> 09:54.999
I mean, did you
Google him or anything?

09:54.999 --> 09:55.999
- Nope.

09:55.999 --> 09:59.999
- Does it drive you crazy
hanging out with all the girls

09:59.999 --> 10:02.999
that Jax has been with here?

10:02.999 --> 10:05.999
And by "here," I mean
"the Greater Los Angeles area."

10:07.999 --> 10:09.999
- Honestly,
before I met Kristen,

10:09.999 --> 10:10.999
I was kind of like, "Oh, gosh,"

10:10.999 --> 10:12.999
but as soon as I met her,
we had the best time,

10:12.999 --> 10:14.999
and then from there on out,
I was close to her.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.999
- Look, I'm beating
around the bush.

10:16.999 --> 10:17.999
He has a horrible reputation.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
- Yeah, and these girls
told me too, so...

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
- Yes,
but that did not deter you.

10:21.999 --> 10:22.999
- Thanks, girls.

10:22.999 --> 10:23.999
- The way he treats,
me and the way that he came off

10:23.999 --> 10:25.999
to me is completely different

10:25.999 --> 10:26.999
from what I hear
from everyone else.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.999
- You're from Kentucky.

10:28.999 --> 10:31.999
What did you leave behind
to move to L.A.?

10:31.999 --> 10:32.999
- Everything.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.999
- So what is it
about this character

10:35.999 --> 10:39.999
that made you leave everything
to move in with him?

10:39.999 --> 10:40.999
- When I first met him,

10:40.999 --> 10:43.000
we just clicked
from the very beginning.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.999
I don't know.
I've never felt that way before.

10:44.999 --> 10:47.999
And I was just immediately
was smitten, I guess.

10:47.999 --> 10:50.999
- Jax, we've seen you
with countless women...

10:50.999 --> 10:52.999
- Oh, my gosh..

10:52.999 --> 10:54.999
- An unbelievable amount
of women,

10:54.999 --> 10:56.999
like, revolving door.

10:56.999 --> 10:59.999
What was it about this woman
that was so special

10:59.999 --> 11:02.999
that you invited her
to move in with you?

11:02.999 --> 11:04.999
- Well, first off, look at her.

11:04.999 --> 11:06.000
I mean, you can't help
but not smile.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.999
I mean, every time
we're together,

11:07.999 --> 11:08.999
we have such a great time.

11:08.999 --> 11:10.999
- She just seems too sweet
for him in my opinion; I mean...

11:11.000 --> 11:12.999
- She is too sweet for...
- She is.

11:12.999 --> 11:14.999
- I think it's a good mix,
good and evil.

11:14.999 --> 11:16.999
No.
- Good and evil.

11:16.999 --> 11:18.999
- But I'm glad
she wasn't scared, because now,

11:18.999 --> 11:21.999
like, we all have such
an amazing new friend.

11:21.999 --> 11:23.999
So I'm glad she didn't listen
to all of the sh**

11:23.999 --> 11:24.999
that we all told her.

11:24.999 --> 11:26.999
- Do you ever yell at him?
Do you ever really--

11:26.999 --> 11:28.999
- I do.
- Oh, you do?

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
- I do, yeah.
- I just can't imagine that.

11:30.999 --> 11:32.999
- It's very rare, so when
it does happen, I listen.

11:32.999 --> 11:33.999
- I do.

11:33.999 --> 11:36.999
- Jax is no stranger
to elective surgery,

11:36.999 --> 11:38.999
and this year,
he elected to have

11:38.999 --> 11:43.999
Peter's girlfriend's boobs
installed on Brittney.

11:43.999 --> 11:44.999
- It's like getting
a haircut, right?

11:44.999 --> 11:45.999
What kind of haircut
would you like?

11:45.999 --> 11:47.999
You look through magazines;
you're like,

11:47.999 --> 11:48.999
"Well, I like this style;
I like this style."

11:48.999 --> 11:51.999
It just so happens that Brittney
and I were on the same page.

11:51.999 --> 11:53.999
We're like,
"Well, we'd like what she has."

11:55.999 --> 11:56.999
- It kept seeming to me--

11:56.999 --> 11:58.999
- It looked like that I
was trying to--

11:58.999 --> 11:59.999
- It did look like that.
- Yeah, but that's not--

11:59.999 --> 12:01.999
Please clarify that.
- But that night, you were.

12:01.999 --> 12:03.999
You were being a dick
that night.

12:03.999 --> 12:04.999
- Wait,
how big are you gonna go?

12:04.999 --> 12:06.999
- She's getting triple Ds.
I'm not being inappropriate.

12:06.999 --> 12:08.999
But we discussed
we like Sarah's.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.999
- Sarah's are way bigger than D.
- Hers are double Ds.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.999
- If I'm gonna help finance
this, I want 'em how I want 'em.

12:14.999 --> 12:15.999
Brittney, did it come off
that way?

12:15.999 --> 12:17.999
Did I--was I like that?

12:17.999 --> 12:18.999
- That night,
you definitely were.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.999
- That night, and that was my
experience of it was that night.

12:21.999 --> 12:22.999
And, you know,
my whole thing is, like,

12:22.999 --> 12:23.999
you know, my body, my boobs.

12:23.999 --> 12:25.999
- She's been wanting this
as just a kid.

12:25.999 --> 12:27.999
- Brittney,
did you get the boobs you wanted

12:27.999 --> 12:28.999
or the boobs that Jax wanted?

12:28.999 --> 12:31.999
- I got the boobs I've wanted
since middle school, so...

12:31.999 --> 12:34.999
- But to be clear, we were
actually going a little smaller,

12:34.999 --> 12:36.999
and then we got on the phone
with her mom,

12:36.999 --> 12:39.999
and her mom was like,
"Hell, no, go bigger," so...

12:39.999 --> 12:41.999
- She said, "Just don't regret
it by getting it too small

12:41.999 --> 12:43.999
and wanting
to change it later in life."

12:43.999 --> 12:45.999
- And the two of you are living
in that studio apartment still?

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
- No, we moved.
- We were though for a while.

12:47.999 --> 12:49.999
And it was getting a little bit
on top of each other.

12:49.999 --> 12:50.999
- Does it bother you

12:50.999 --> 12:53.999
that he poops
with the door open?

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
- Babe, I don't know
if there's enough room

12:56.999 --> 12:57.999
to hang anything else in here.

12:57.999 --> 12:58.999
- There better be room.

12:58.999 --> 13:00.999
I will literally have a meltdown
if I see a mess.

13:00.999 --> 13:01.999
- Yeah, I know.

13:01.999 --> 13:02.999
I'll be talking to him
in the apartment,

13:02.999 --> 13:04.999
and his voice
is sounding so clear,

13:04.999 --> 13:06.999
and I'm like, "You don't have
the door shut again?"

13:06.999 --> 13:08.999
- The dog likes to come in
and hang out.

13:08.999 --> 13:10.999
Sometimes I can see the TV.
and the game's on, so...

13:10.999 --> 13:13.999
- God, I mean, like, you're not
even married 30 years--

13:13.999 --> 13:15.999
- Oh, my God, we've all pooped
with the door open.

13:15.999 --> 13:16.999
Let's not make this a big deal.
- No, no.

13:16.999 --> 13:17.999
Actually, no, we haven't.

13:17.999 --> 13:19.999
- Well, in my house,
we poop with the door open.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.999
- Okay, I want to switch gears.

13:21.999 --> 13:22.999
I want to talk business.

13:22.999 --> 13:25.000
Wall Street went crazy
with the news

13:25.000 --> 13:30.999
that two hotshot business guys
had accepted internships.

13:30.999 --> 13:32.000
Lisa, what are you gonna do
with all the money

13:32.999 --> 13:34.999
that Tom's made for you?

13:34.999 --> 13:37.999
- I have to say,
it was incredibly amusing.

13:37.999 --> 13:40.999
- When I'm out there
in St. Louis at the bar,

13:40.999 --> 13:43.999
I'll order
some of the LVP Sangria,

13:43.999 --> 13:44.999
and they'll be like,
"Oh, what's that?"

13:44.999 --> 13:45.999
Of course,
people would ask immediately.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.999
Like, what?
What is that?

13:47.999 --> 13:49.999
And I'm like, "Oh, this is
Lisa Vanderpump's sangria."

13:49.999 --> 13:51.999
- This can't just be, like,
I'm going up to little clubs

13:51.999 --> 13:53.999
and pubs and bars in St. Louis.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.999
- Sandoval,
what did you think

13:55.999 --> 13:59.999
that you were going to be
able to do as ambassadors?

13:59.999 --> 14:01.999
- It's one of those things
where, look,

14:01.999 --> 14:02.999
you guys know what I can do.

14:02.999 --> 14:03.999
You know me well enough.

14:03.999 --> 14:06.999
Just you need to put me
where I belong.

14:06.999 --> 14:09.999
I can't tell you where I belong.
You know me.

14:09.999 --> 14:12.999
- So Lisa and Pandora
have to do the work.

14:12.999 --> 14:14.999
- Basic--basically,
come up with a plan

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
of where I fit in.

14:16.999 --> 14:17.999
- We want to help
increase visibility

14:17.999 --> 14:19.999
and be brand ambassadors,

14:19.999 --> 14:21.999
talking to people, telling them
about the product, you know?

14:21.999 --> 14:23.999
- Say you started on Monday.

14:23.999 --> 14:24.999
Where do you start?
What do you do?

14:28.999 --> 14:30.999
- That's--that's the issue
that we're coming up--

14:30.999 --> 14:33.999
coming--have come to.

14:33.999 --> 14:34.999
- Schwartz,
you seemed stunned

14:34.999 --> 14:37.999
that there was work
that would be involved,

14:37.999 --> 14:38.999
and time commitments...

14:38.999 --> 14:39.999
- He's like, "Wait."

14:39.999 --> 14:41.999
- That would come attached
to a paycheck.

14:41.999 --> 14:44.999
- I realized that
I just didn't want to do it.

14:44.999 --> 14:45.999
My heart wasn't in it.

14:45.999 --> 14:48.999
- This is the second time
you've wimped out just, like,

14:48.999 --> 14:50.999
a big bloody wussy pussy.

14:50.999 --> 14:52.999
- Katie, you were pretty tough
on Tom.

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
- Yeah.
I mean, I think it's

14:54.999 --> 14:57.999
I think it's just because
it's so much about

14:57.999 --> 14:58.999
his lack of commitment
to things,

14:58.999 --> 15:00.999
and I know he has
so much potential,

15:00.999 --> 15:03.999
and he's just scared of it,
so I get frustrated

15:03.999 --> 15:05.999
when I don't see him
actually go for things.

15:05.999 --> 15:07.999
- I mean, I love him.
- Yeah.

15:07.999 --> 15:08.999
- He knows I love him,
but he doesn't commit to things.

15:08.999 --> 15:10.999
- I know. I know.
I have commitment issues.

15:10.999 --> 15:11.999
And I'm working on it.

15:11.999 --> 15:13.999
- Okay, I want to switch gears.

15:13.999 --> 15:16.999
This year, Katie and Scheana
grew closer than ever,

15:16.999 --> 15:20.999
while Ariana and Scheana
kind of drifted apart.

15:20.999 --> 15:22.999
Scheana, do you think
that you value the friendship

15:22.999 --> 15:24.999
more than she does?

15:24.999 --> 15:28.999
- No, I think we both value
the friendship equally.

15:28.999 --> 15:31.999
It just changed this past year.

15:31.999 --> 15:35.999
I felt a change
in her personality.

15:35.999 --> 15:38.999
- Scheana, you even nicknamed
Ariana "Bitchy Barbie."

15:38.999 --> 15:39.999
- I don't even
know where that came from.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.999
Like, I don't even
remember saying that.

15:41.999 --> 15:42.999
- Well, you did.

15:42.999 --> 15:46.999
Ariana, is Scheana
your best friend?

15:46.999 --> 15:49.999
- Scheana is somebody
who I've loved

15:49.999 --> 15:51.999
and cared about for years,

15:51.999 --> 15:53.999
and I will always love
and care about her,

15:53.999 --> 15:55.999
and I don't--you know,
I don't like saying,

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
like, best, 'cause it's like--

15:57.999 --> 15:58.999
really,
it's just kind of, like, silly.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.999
- Well, when you guys
were best friends,

16:00.999 --> 16:01.999
you would always say
you guys were best friends.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.999
- I mean, look,
she's one of my best friends.

16:03.999 --> 16:04.999
- And now you're not
best friends anymore, so...

16:04.999 --> 16:05.999
- She's one of my best friends.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.999
That's not--that's not, like,
going anywhere, but--

16:07.999 --> 16:09.999
- I may not be, like, her number
one best friend, but--

16:09.999 --> 16:10.999
- But here's the thing.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.999
There's an ebb and flow
in relationships.

16:13.999 --> 16:15.999
Things have ups,
and they have downs,

16:15.999 --> 16:17.999
and they have--
there's a back and a forth,

16:17.999 --> 16:19.999
and things are fine
the way they are,

16:19.999 --> 16:24.000
and, you know, we've just kind
of figured out a new way to be.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.999
- Katie, you've been pretty
critical of Ariana. Why?

16:26.999 --> 16:29.999
- You know, I just felt
like she was kind of,

16:29.999 --> 16:31.999
yeah, like,
a bit of a Debbie Downer.

16:31.999 --> 16:32.999
I just noticed, like,
being around here,

16:32.999 --> 16:34.999
she would like--there was
a little cloud

16:34.999 --> 16:35.999
that hung over her.

16:35.999 --> 16:39.000
- Well, when every time
you show up somewhere,

16:39.999 --> 16:41.999
it's something else
thrown in your face

16:41.999 --> 16:44.999
when you were just trying
to make a funny comment

16:44.999 --> 16:46.999
that somehow got twisted
and held over my head

16:46.999 --> 16:49.999
and used as ammunition
against me,

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
it gets kind of hard
to want to come around.

16:51.999 --> 16:54.999
- But, Ariana, do you see
how it might come across

16:54.999 --> 16:57.999
that you think
that you're too good

16:57.999 --> 16:58.999
or on a different plane?

16:58.999 --> 17:01.999
- Well, until I tell you
that I'm too good for you

17:01.999 --> 17:03.999
and tell you that I'm on
a different plane,

17:03.999 --> 17:04.999
that's an assumption--

17:04.999 --> 17:06.999
- But when you speak just kind
of blanket statements like that,

17:06.999 --> 17:08.999
like, "I have to, like,
dumb myself down

17:08.999 --> 17:10.999
for these people," like,
do you understand how that--

17:10.999 --> 17:11.999
- Katie, you're my friend.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.999
Schwartz, you're my friend.

17:13.999 --> 17:14.999
Scheana, you are my friend.

17:14.999 --> 17:16.999
Brittney, I really love you.

17:16.999 --> 17:17.999
Lala, you're my friend.

17:17.999 --> 17:18.999
That's it.
- Thanks, babe.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.999
- I'm not in a group.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.999
This is the most
toxic environment

17:23.999 --> 17:26.999
I've ever witnessed in my life.

17:26.999 --> 17:30.999
How you guys don't see that
blows my mind.

17:30.999 --> 17:32.999
What the hell?
- Yeah.

17:32.999 --> 17:34.999
- It's toxic as f***.

17:41.999 --> 17:42.999
- She, in her words, said--

17:42.999 --> 17:43.999
- She never brought it up
to you.

17:43.999 --> 17:44.999
- In her words.

17:44.999 --> 17:47.999
- Scheana, take some f***ing
responsibility.

17:52.999 --> 17:54.000
- Who here thinks that therapy

17:53.999 --> 17:54.000
has really changed Kristen?

17:55.999 --> 17:57.000
- I do.
- I do.

17:57.999 --> 17:58.999
- I do.

17:58.999 --> 17:59.999
- You know,
she's out on good behavior.

17:59.999 --> 18:00.999
She's on parole.

18:00.999 --> 18:02.999
Everything's been going great.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.999
- Yeah, it's kind of like a--
it's like a "probation period."

18:04.999 --> 18:07.999
- Ariana, do you think
therapy has changed Kristen?

18:07.999 --> 18:10.999
- I think it's changed the way
that she knows how to behave

18:10.999 --> 18:11.999
in front of people.

18:14.999 --> 18:16.999
- Kristen,
how did you feel about the fact

18:16.999 --> 18:20.999
that James got invited over you
to the birthday trip in Hawaii?

18:20.999 --> 18:22.999
- He definitely
shouldn't have been there, but--

18:22.999 --> 18:24.999
- Why?
- I--

18:24.999 --> 18:25.999
- Why?
- Because they don't like you.

18:25.999 --> 18:27.999
- Tom likes me.
- Okay, so Tom likes you.

18:27.999 --> 18:28.999
- It was his birthday.
- I like you.

18:28.999 --> 18:29.999
- Jax can't stand you.
- Lala likes me.

18:29.999 --> 18:30.999
- That was--yeah, I--

18:30.999 --> 18:32.999
- Yeah, I know,
but that was a conversation Jax

18:32.999 --> 18:33.999
and I had man-to-man
at that bar right there.

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
- He just gave in, because he
didn't want to fight with Tom.

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
- Hold on, Hold on.
If I remember correctly--

18:37.999 --> 18:39.999
if I remember correctly,
watching the episodes back,

18:39.999 --> 18:41.999
you were pretty much
begging him, all right?

18:41.999 --> 18:42.999
And he never gave you the go.

18:42.999 --> 18:43.999
He never gave you the go

18:43.999 --> 18:45.999
because he didn't
want you there either.

18:45.999 --> 18:46.999
I know he didn't.
- Jax did want her there.

18:46.999 --> 18:48.999
And he invited her.
- No, he didn't. No, he didn't.

18:48.999 --> 18:50.999
- And then it didn't work.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.999
- You say that though.
- Let's be very clear.

18:52.999 --> 18:53.999
- I was f***ing there.

18:53.999 --> 18:54.999
- Just can't get it out.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.999
- I was trying to make
a f***ing point!

18:56.999 --> 18:57.999
- Okay.
- Get it out.

18:57.999 --> 18:58.999
- f***! I can't!

18:58.999 --> 19:00.999
- Okay, just make it, sweetie.
Just make it.

19:00.999 --> 19:02.999
- The point is, is,
don't give me that look, man,

19:02.999 --> 19:04.999
'cause it puts me in my head
and makes it ten times worse.

19:04.999 --> 19:06.999
- Okay, yeah, you're right.
- And ten times longer, Andy.

19:06.999 --> 19:08.999
- Guys, just let him talk,
or you're in trouble.

19:08.999 --> 19:10.999
- I got to tell you, all this
sh** didn't come out of nowhere.

19:10.999 --> 19:11.999
I mean, you know,

19:11.999 --> 19:13.999
when we were planning
this birthday trip,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.999
I got f***ing attacked left
and right about why I don't want

19:17.999 --> 19:19.999
my ex-girlfriend
to come on the birthday trip.

19:19.999 --> 19:21.999
- Every time
my name is mentioned,

19:21.999 --> 19:24.999
it's like a f***ing bomb
was just dropped in your lap.

19:24.999 --> 19:26.999
That's how you act.
Actions speak louder than words.

19:26.999 --> 19:27.999
That is what I witnessed.

19:27.999 --> 19:31.999
- The point is, is that Jax had
no problem with her not going,

19:31.999 --> 19:34.999
but then all of a sudden,
it became this,

19:34.999 --> 19:37.999
like, campaign of,
like, why Kristen should go,

19:37.999 --> 19:41.999
and then the moment of silence
when we get to Hawaii,

19:41.999 --> 19:43.999
where you're just like,
"Well, you know,

19:43.999 --> 19:47.999
I just really wish
some people could've came here."

19:47.999 --> 19:50.999
- I do wish
some other people were here.

19:50.999 --> 19:52.999
I feel like there are
some people

19:52.999 --> 19:54.999
that are here that shouldn't be.

19:56.999 --> 19:58.999
- Because he didn't want
James there,

19:58.999 --> 19:59.999
and James was being a dick;
I watched the episode.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.999
- Yeah, but it's,
like, so--

20:01.999 --> 20:03.999
it doesn't f***ing matter
about James.

20:03.999 --> 20:05.999
It has to do with the fact
that it's like,

20:05.999 --> 20:06.999
where are my feelings in this?

20:06.999 --> 20:08.999
Way down on the f***ing bottom.

20:08.999 --> 20:09.999
- I understand.
No, I get it.

20:09.999 --> 20:10.999
- Way down
on the f***ing bottom.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.999
Nobody gives a f***.

20:12.999 --> 20:15.999
- Okay, so we're in Hawaii now,
and, Ariana,

20:15.999 --> 20:17.999
you had barely unpacked

20:17.999 --> 20:21.999
before you whipped out
a series of Tom-bashing texts

20:21.999 --> 20:23.999
that Scheana sent your mom.

20:23.999 --> 20:26.999
What did you think
when you first read them?

20:26.999 --> 20:28.999
- Part of me was really
bothered by what she said,

20:28.999 --> 20:31.999
and part of me was very confused
by what she was saying,

20:31.999 --> 20:33.999
because a lot
of what she said

20:33.999 --> 20:36.999
were these weird,
backhanded,

20:36.999 --> 20:39.999
yet very offensive things
about Tom

20:39.999 --> 20:41.999
that don't even--
aren't really accurate.

20:41.999 --> 20:43.999
- Because your mom said
she was concerned.

20:43.999 --> 20:44.999
- No.

20:44.999 --> 20:46.999
- You'd know if you read
every single one of them.

20:46.999 --> 20:47.999
- I did, actually.

20:47.999 --> 20:49.999
I mean, we could do
a f***ing role-play right now--

20:49.999 --> 20:50.999
- Okay, you could read
every positive thing

20:50.999 --> 20:51.999
I said about you too.

20:53.999 --> 20:56.000
- "Tom will always look out
for himself first."

20:56.999 --> 20:58.999
- "My best friend sh**

20:58.999 --> 21:01.999
all over my boyfriend
to my mom."

21:01.999 --> 21:02.999
She, in her words, said--

21:02.999 --> 21:03.999
- She never brought it up
to you.

21:03.999 --> 21:05.999
- In her words--

21:05.999 --> 21:07.999
- Scheana, take some
f***ing responsibility.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.999
For the love of God; like,
that sh** was f***ing shady.

21:09.999 --> 21:11.999
- The sh**
that she says is like,

21:11.999 --> 21:13.999
"I think she's very
happy with Tom,

21:13.999 --> 21:15.999
but I feel like it's all
about Tom all the time."

21:15.999 --> 21:16.999
- At the time, it was.

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
- Are you f***ing kidding me?

21:18.999 --> 21:21.999
- "I think Tom will always
look out for himself first,

21:21.999 --> 21:22.999
and it shouldn't be that way."

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
- At the end of the day--
- Yes, at the time, Tom--

21:24.999 --> 21:25.999
- At the time what?
- Oh, my God.

21:25.999 --> 21:27.999
At the time,
you were being a dick.

21:27.999 --> 21:29.999
- No, I wasn't.
- You were.

21:29.999 --> 21:30.999
- No, I wasn't.
- Oh, my God.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
- So, Scheana, you want to know
what's really sad is,

21:32.999 --> 21:35.999
my mom went from December
of 2014 all the way

21:35.999 --> 21:39.999
to July of 2015
thinking that the sh**

21:39.999 --> 21:42.000
that you said to her about Tom
might've been legit.

21:42.999 --> 21:44.000
- Ariana, your mom
sent out a tweet saying,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
"I never had concerns
about Ariana.

21:46.999 --> 21:48.999
"She hasn't changed in 30 years.

21:48.999 --> 21:51.999
"My 'reaching out' to Scheana
was to say sorry

21:51.999 --> 21:53.999
I won't see at you
at Christmas."

21:53.999 --> 21:54.999
- And is my daughter
in a good place?

21:54.999 --> 21:55.999
And I am worried.

21:55.999 --> 21:57.999
If she was concerned
for that long,

21:57.999 --> 21:58.999
then she should've talked
about you about it.

21:58.999 --> 22:00.999
If she was concerned--
- She wasn't concerned.

22:00.999 --> 22:02.999
Oh, my God.
- You said she went that long--

22:02.999 --> 22:05.999
- Hey, hey, let me throw a stick
in the river, okay?

22:05.999 --> 22:08.000
Let me throw a stick
in the river.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Scheana.
- Yes.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Do you not understand

22:11.999 --> 22:13.999
why they might be
a little upset about--

22:13.999 --> 22:14.999
- I do, absolutely.

22:14.999 --> 22:17.000
That's why I've apologized
numerous times.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.999
- Your apology was,
"I apologize"--

22:18.999 --> 22:20.999
- Sorry, not sorry.

22:20.999 --> 22:22.999
- I'm not sorry for feeling
the way I felt at the time.

22:22.999 --> 22:24.999
I'm sorry I said it.

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
I'm sorry I said it
to her mother.

22:26.999 --> 22:28.999
Is that what you want me to say?
Like, I've already apologized.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.999
- No, I don't, no.

22:30.999 --> 22:32.999
That's not
taking responsibility.

22:32.999 --> 22:33.999
- I took responsibility.

22:33.999 --> 22:34.999
I f***ing texted her.
Yes, I did. I know that.

22:34.999 --> 22:38.999
- Scheana, with everything
that you had going on with Shay,

22:38.999 --> 22:40.999
imagine if Ariana had spoken

22:40.999 --> 22:41.999
to your mother
about your problem.

22:41.999 --> 22:43.999
- I would've appreciated that.

22:43.999 --> 22:45.999
I absolutely would've
appreciated that.

22:45.999 --> 22:47.999
- You might have seemed
derogatory about Shay.

22:47.999 --> 22:48.999
Do you understand?
- ****.

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
- If somebody did that
to me and my mom,

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
best believe sh** would be
going down, and it would be you.

22:52.999 --> 22:53.999
- It's f***ing backstabbing.
It's severely backstabbing.

22:53.999 --> 22:54.999
- Don't pit a daughter--

22:55.000 --> 22:56.999
- Why are you getting involved
in this?

22:56.999 --> 22:57.999
- Because this is a mother
that you're sitting here

22:57.999 --> 22:59.999
trying to be like,
"Your mom did this."

22:59.999 --> 23:00.999
That's her safe place.

23:00.999 --> 23:01.999
That's someone
who gave birth to her.

23:01.999 --> 23:04.999
- I was saying her mom
reached out to me is all I said.

23:04.999 --> 23:05.999
- 'Cause she was concerned.

23:05.999 --> 23:07.999
- I think the tweet
says everything.

23:07.999 --> 23:09.999
The mom was not concerned,
so let it be.

23:09.999 --> 23:10.999
- Yes, she did.

23:10.999 --> 23:12.999
- She reached out to you
to tell you she wasn't

23:12.999 --> 23:13.999
coming to Christmas.

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
- And then she said,
"In your opinion"--

23:15.999 --> 23:17.999
- After she asked, like,
"How is your family doing?"

23:17.999 --> 23:19.999
How's your family doing?"

23:19.999 --> 23:22.999
- Okay, moving on,
moving on.

23:22.999 --> 23:25.999
Okay, Schwartz,
when y'all were in Hawaii,

23:25.999 --> 23:28.999
you ran and told Katie

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
that you saw a lot
of boobies that day.

23:30.999 --> 23:31.999
- Well, my fresh
virgin eyes

23:31.999 --> 23:34.999
had been forever
tainted by them.

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
- Katie, you know,
we've seen a lot of boobs

23:45.999 --> 23:46.999
on "Vanderpump Rules."

23:47.000 --> 23:49.999
Were you so offended
by the idea of Lala taking--

23:49.999 --> 23:52.999
- I'm not offended by boobs.
- You are offended.

23:52.999 --> 23:53.999
You sat there,
and you were like--

23:53.999 --> 23:54.999
- No, I'm offended
by your behavior,

23:55.000 --> 23:56.999
because I think
it's inappropriate.

23:56.999 --> 23:58.999
- I'm offended by your behavior.
- Okay, Lala.

23:58.999 --> 23:59.999
- You were the one
who was disrespectful.

23:59.999 --> 24:03.999
- Lala, you're disrespectful.
You cry because we're not nice.

24:03.999 --> 24:04.999
You cry because
you don't fit in.

24:04.999 --> 24:07.999
You cry, cry, cry, but, like,
you don't do a good job

24:07.999 --> 24:09.999
of trying to gain--

24:09.999 --> 24:10.999
- You didn't like me
from the jump.

24:10.999 --> 24:12.999
- I didn't like you
until I realized

24:12.999 --> 24:15.999
I couldn't believe anything
that came out of your mouth.

24:15.999 --> 24:20.999
- This was so amazing
for you that I messed up,

24:20.999 --> 24:23.999
because you now had a reason
not to like Lala.

24:23.999 --> 24:25.999
And there's no winning with
this group.

24:25.999 --> 24:27.999
There's no winning.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.999
- She believes
that you should be proud

24:29.999 --> 24:30.999
of your sexuality, right?

24:30.999 --> 24:31.999
- Yes.
- It's okay to flaunt it.

24:31.999 --> 24:35.000
She just thought that you were
rubbing it in our face.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.999
That's what she thought,
and it was tasteful.

24:36.999 --> 24:38.999
It was fine, but--

24:38.999 --> 24:42.999
- Then why are you upset?
Like, I'm so confused.

24:42.999 --> 24:44.999
You're very passive-aggressive.

24:44.999 --> 24:46.000
I'm indifferent;
I was very indifferent of you

24:46.000 --> 24:47.999
for a long time.

24:47.999 --> 24:48.999
- Indifference is worse
than hate, honey.

24:48.999 --> 24:50.000
I'd rather you sit there
and be like,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.999
"You're a stupid ho-ass bitch"
than sit there and make stupid,

24:53.999 --> 24:55.999
like, you look
like you're in a rap video,

24:55.999 --> 24:57.999
which if you've ever
seen a rap video,

24:57.999 --> 24:59.999
my ass is way too small to be
in one of those, honey.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.999
- Brittney, you were there
with your boyfriend, Jax.

25:03.999 --> 25:06.999
Were you offended by the girls
taking their tops off

25:06.999 --> 25:09.999
when you were there, you know,
with your boyfriend?

25:09.999 --> 25:10.999
- Well, I actually--
I hadn't had a chance

25:10.999 --> 25:12.999
to speak with Lala yet,
so I hadn't heard

25:12.999 --> 25:14.999
all these rumors
that were going around,

25:14.999 --> 25:18.999
so I already didn't have
the best view on this girl.

25:18.999 --> 25:20.999
So after that was going on,

25:20.999 --> 25:22.999
I felt like it was kind of
an attention-grabber as well.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.999
- Oh, my gosh.
- It was just inappropriate.

25:24.999 --> 25:25.999
Like, why with a bunch
of couples

25:25.999 --> 25:27.999
and people you don't even know?

25:27.999 --> 25:28.999
You're like, "Now would be
the time to take my top off."

25:28.999 --> 25:31.999
- Every day is a good time
to take your top off.

25:31.999 --> 25:33.999
- I just don't do that.
I mean--

25:33.999 --> 25:36.000
- All I'm saying to you, Katie,
if you had a problem,

25:36.999 --> 25:39.999
I would've been totally okay
with you grabbing me

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
and being like, "Lala,
I know we don't connect,

25:41.999 --> 25:42.999
"but can you please--I heard
you took your top off.

25:42.999 --> 25:43.999
- I already tried that with you;
it didn't work, so--

25:43.999 --> 25:44.999
- No, you didn't.

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
Okay, well,
you had an issue with me,

25:46.999 --> 25:47.999
and if there was
an issue about me--

25:47.999 --> 25:48.999
- I didn't have an issue
with you.

25:48.999 --> 25:50.999
- Okay, I'm speaking.
Why do you keep cutting me off?

25:50.999 --> 25:52.999
Listen.

25:52.999 --> 25:54.999
- If you had a problem
with me taking my top off--

25:54.999 --> 25:56.999
- 'Cause you know about wrapping
people up and cutting them off,

25:56.999 --> 25:57.999
don't you, Lala?

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
- I do.
- Ooh.

25:59.999 --> 26:00.999
- Drop the mic.

26:00.999 --> 26:03.999
- Would it be an issue
if Lala wasn't so hot?

26:03.999 --> 26:07.999
- No, if I was--she's hot.
She's hot. She's hot.

26:07.999 --> 26:10.999
I'm not threatened
by beautiful women.

26:10.999 --> 26:12.999
- Clearly, you--
oh my God.

26:12.999 --> 26:13.999
- Every time
they make a big deal

26:13.999 --> 26:15.999
about her being topless,

26:15.999 --> 26:17.999
we all grew up--I mean,
James will tell you this--

26:17.999 --> 26:20.999
I didn't see anybody
wear a top for 20 years.

26:20.999 --> 26:23.999
- But this is America.
- Jax.

26:23.999 --> 26:24.999
- I'm waiting for the question.
I know it's coming.

26:24.999 --> 26:26.999
- Jax, while Brittney
was driving herself

26:26.999 --> 26:30.999
out from Kentucky
to start a life with you,

26:30.999 --> 26:34.999
you looked Lala in the eye
and said, "She's not coming."

26:34.999 --> 26:36.999
"Brittney's not coming,"
you said to her.

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
- Do you want to come
have drinks with us?

26:38.999 --> 26:39.999
- Yeah, I do.

26:39.999 --> 26:40.999
- Jax, I heard Brittney was
coming back in town today.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.999
- Wait, hold on.
Baby girl is coming?

26:42.999 --> 26:44.999
- He's a child.
He's not a man--he's a child.

26:44.999 --> 26:46.999
- We're not talking about him.
We're talking about--

26:46.999 --> 26:49.999
- Brittney's not coming.

26:49.999 --> 26:51.999
- What was your reaction to that
when you saw that on the show?

26:51.999 --> 26:53.999
- Oh, I was mad.

26:53.999 --> 26:54.999
- You were?
- Uh-huh, I was very mad.

26:54.999 --> 26:56.999
- Yeah, I was--I was way more
flirty than I should've been.

26:56.999 --> 26:58.999
- Yeah.

27:01.999 --> 27:03.999
- Stop it.

27:03.999 --> 27:06.999
- What did Jax tell you
about Lala

27:06.999 --> 27:09.999
when you arrived from Kentucky?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.999
- He told me that she was really
flirtatious with him,

27:12.999 --> 27:13.999
and of course he didn't
tell me the extent

27:13.999 --> 27:16.999
of how far it actually had gone.

27:16.999 --> 27:18.999
- Jax, do you feel
like you lied to Brittney?

27:18.999 --> 27:19.999
- Yes.

27:19.999 --> 27:21.999
- You knew the episode
was coming up.

27:21.999 --> 27:22.999
- Yeah, I knew.
I knew.

27:22.999 --> 27:24.999
- So did you warn Brittney
before--

27:24.999 --> 27:26.000
- I did.
- She did.

27:26.999 --> 27:29.999
- Oh, really?
- He didn't. Nope.

27:29.999 --> 27:30.999
I mean,
I was moving and changing

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
my entire life for this man,

27:32.999 --> 27:34.999
and I just wanted to know
what was actually going on.

27:34.999 --> 27:38.999
- The worst part about it
was Jax looking me in my eyes

27:38.999 --> 27:40.999
and being like,
"I never said that to you."

27:41.000 --> 27:42.999
Own up to the sh**
you said in my ear.

27:42.999 --> 27:43.999
- I never said anything.

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
- You said,
"I promise I'm gonna f*** you."

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, my God.

27:47.999 --> 27:48.999
Oh, my God.

27:48.999 --> 27:49.999
- I never said that.

27:49.999 --> 27:52.999
- I am always brutally honest.

27:52.999 --> 27:55.999
Just own up that it wasn't
just me flirting to thin air.

27:55.999 --> 27:58.999
- Brittney, now
that you've seen the episodes,

27:59.000 --> 28:02.999
would you have backed Jax?

28:02.999 --> 28:03.999
- I don't know.
I mean--

28:03.999 --> 28:05.999
- What respectful woman would?
I mean, after--

28:05.999 --> 28:06.999
- Yeah,
I mean, I was very upset,

28:06.999 --> 28:08.000
and my feelings were very hurt,

28:08.999 --> 28:10.999
and we had to go
through it all over again,

28:10.999 --> 28:11.999
go through an argument
all over again,

28:11.999 --> 28:14.999
but at the same time,
I just chose to stand by my man

28:14.999 --> 28:18.999
who I loved than somebody
who I had only met two times.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.999
- Did you think that Brittney
wouldn't find out?

28:22.999 --> 28:24.999
Did you think that the camera
didn't catch it?

28:24.999 --> 28:26.999
- Whatever.
- Don't say "whatever."

28:26.999 --> 28:27.999
- I'm not--
- Yeah, don't say "whatever."

28:27.999 --> 28:29.999
Exactly.
What do you mean, "whatever?"

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
Like, "I don't care"?
"I don't give a damn"?

28:31.999 --> 28:33.999
- Look, I told you my reasons
of doing what I did

28:33.999 --> 28:36.000
was just mostly to go at him.

28:36.999 --> 28:38.999
If I wanted to act on it,
I would've.

28:38.999 --> 28:39.999
You know me.
I would've.

28:39.999 --> 28:41.999
If I wanted to do it,
I would've went at it.

28:41.999 --> 28:42.999
- Okay,
well, it's a mutual thing.

28:42.999 --> 28:44.999
If Jax and I wanted
to sleep together,

28:44.999 --> 28:45.999
we very well would have.

28:45.999 --> 28:47.999
- Okay,
that didn't happen.

28:47.999 --> 28:49.999
I have a girlfriend, and it went
no further than that.

28:49.999 --> 28:51.999
It was whatever.

28:51.999 --> 28:54.999
- We're gonna take a break.
More from Sur when we come back.

28:57.999 --> 28:59.999
Possible wedding bells?

28:59.999 --> 29:00.999
- Yes, my mind has changed.

29:00.999 --> 29:02.999
- Really?

29:13.999 --> 29:15.999
- We are back at Sur
in West Hollywood

29:15.999 --> 29:17.000
for the
"Vanderpump Rules Reunion."

29:17.999 --> 29:19.999
Jax, I am sure
that you are quite sick

29:19.999 --> 29:20.999
of telling this story,
but you're gonna tell it

29:21.000 --> 29:22.999
one more time.

29:22.999 --> 29:26.999
What happened with you
and the sunglasses?

29:26.999 --> 29:28.999
On the show,
you're leaving that day.

29:28.999 --> 29:29.999
You're really hungover.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.999
You're packing your bags.

29:31.999 --> 29:34.999
Cut to you're arrested.

29:34.999 --> 29:35.999
What happened between that time?
- Well, okay.

29:35.999 --> 29:37.999
So we started drinking
through the day.

29:37.999 --> 29:38.999
Everybody else kind of went
and did their own thing,

29:38.999 --> 29:40.999
so Brittney and I are like,
"Whatever, it's fine.

29:40.999 --> 29:41.999
"We'll go on this booze cruise.

29:41.999 --> 29:42.999
That sounds fun."

29:43.000 --> 29:44.999
You know, we started drinking,
and then we went

29:44.999 --> 29:45.999
on a booze cruise,
and we went back to the bar,

29:46.000 --> 29:49.999
and, you know, barefoot
and sand in my shorts,

29:49.999 --> 29:51.999
I decided to stroll
through a store

29:51.999 --> 29:54.999
and take a pair of sunglasses.

29:54.999 --> 29:56.999
- What was your reaction?

29:56.999 --> 29:57.999
You didn't know that you had
taken the sunglasses.

29:57.999 --> 29:58.999
- I felt so bad for her.
- No.

29:58.999 --> 30:00.999
I was sitting at the bar
waiting for him

30:00.999 --> 30:02.999
for, like, 30 minutes,
and then he finally comes back,

30:02.999 --> 30:04.000
gave me the glasses.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.999
I had no idea what was going on.

30:05.999 --> 30:06.999
- What, he gave you the glasses
and said,

30:06.999 --> 30:07.999
"Here's a present for you?"

30:07.999 --> 30:09.999
- Mm-hmm.
- Hold on a second.

30:09.999 --> 30:11.999
So didn't you--
this does not make sense.

30:11.999 --> 30:13.000
- I was just drinking too,
so when he gave 'em to me,

30:13.000 --> 30:14.999
I was like, "Oh, my God, yay!"

30:14.999 --> 30:16.999
- I mean, for my birthday,
he bought me the same glasses.

30:16.999 --> 30:18.999
Katie was with him.

30:18.999 --> 30:20.999
He purchased those glasses,
but at, like, a Sunglass Hut.

30:20.999 --> 30:22.999
- And at Sunglass Hut,

30:22.999 --> 30:24.000
they don't give you
the Tiffany's packaging.

30:24.999 --> 30:26.999
- Yeah, he even, like,
went back and said,

30:26.999 --> 30:27.999
"This is what happened
when I bought them

30:27.999 --> 30:28.999
for Scheana's birthday,
so, like, I--

30:28.999 --> 30:30.000
why would I think it was stolen?

30:30.000 --> 30:31.999
- So you doubled down
on your lie?

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
- I didn't know.
- I got to sell the story.

30:33.999 --> 30:34.999
- And you got busted.

30:34.999 --> 30:35.999
- They came and got me,
and they're like,

30:35.999 --> 30:37.999
"Did you take a pair?"

30:37.999 --> 30:38.999
I'm like, "Yeah."
I just gave it to them.

30:38.999 --> 30:40.999
And, like, "I thought
that would be it."

30:40.999 --> 30:42.999
- So you knew
what you were doing?

30:42.999 --> 30:44.999
- I was intoxicated, yes.

30:44.999 --> 30:46.999
- Brittney,
you've come from Kentucky.

30:46.999 --> 30:48.999
You've given everything up.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

30:48.999 --> 30:51.999
- Do you think you bet
on the wrong horse?

30:51.999 --> 30:53.999
- I mean,
I wanted to be there for him,

30:53.999 --> 30:55.999
but I knew that he had a lot
of growing to do

30:55.999 --> 30:56.999
as soon as that happened.

30:56.999 --> 30:58.999
I started to find out
how much work

30:58.999 --> 31:00.999
I was gonna have to
put into this one.

31:00.999 --> 31:03.999
- Well, Jax, this is not
your first run-in with the law.

31:03.999 --> 31:04.999
You've--

31:04.999 --> 31:07.999
- I've been in--well,
what are you asking me first?

31:07.999 --> 31:08.999
I don't...

31:08.999 --> 31:09.999
I've been down this road.

31:09.999 --> 31:11.999
- What have you been arrested
for in the past?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.999
- Lots of stuff.
- Lots of stuff.

31:13.999 --> 31:16.999
- I've been to jail
about five times.

31:16.999 --> 31:18.999
- You've been
to jail five times?

31:18.999 --> 31:19.999
- Yeah,
a couple DUIs,

31:19.999 --> 31:22.999
suspended license,
tickets.

31:22.999 --> 31:24.999
Nothing, like, criminal.
Just stupid sh**.

31:24.999 --> 31:26.999
- Did you know he had a criminal
record before you moved in?

31:26.999 --> 31:29.999
- I found out throughout
the whole sunglass ordeal.

31:29.999 --> 31:32.999
- Had you known that he had been
to jail five times,

31:32.999 --> 31:34.999
would you have moved
in with him?

31:36.999 --> 31:37.999
- It's okay, babe.
You can tell the truth.

31:37.999 --> 31:38.999
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

31:38.999 --> 31:39.999
- No, I don't know.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.999
- Vanderpump,
why didn't you fire Jax?

31:42.999 --> 31:44.999
- I just felt
like it was kicking him

31:44.999 --> 31:46.000
when he was down,

31:46.999 --> 31:49.999
and I really barraged him,
and I was furious with him,

31:49.999 --> 31:51.999
but it didn't happen
in the restaurant.

31:51.999 --> 31:53.999
- Oh, but stealing from
your restaurant is--

31:53.999 --> 31:55.999
- I'm sorry; how many times
have you gotten suspended

31:55.999 --> 31:56.999
and other sh**?

31:56.999 --> 31:58.999
- But not for stealing.

31:58.999 --> 32:01.999
- You're not even
working right now.

32:01.999 --> 32:03.999
How many times
you been wasted at work?

32:03.999 --> 32:05.999
- A lot.
- Whose alcohol you drinking?

32:05.999 --> 32:07.999
Who hasn't stole?

32:07.999 --> 32:08.999
- I'm looking around
for something to take today.

32:08.999 --> 32:11.999
- Hey, listen, listen.

32:11.999 --> 32:12.999
The tills, the cash,

32:12.999 --> 32:15.999
everything's always
been 1,000% with him.

32:15.999 --> 32:17.999
- Right.
Okay.

32:17.999 --> 32:21.999
Jax, after Hawaii, you seemed
to come unraveled a bit.

32:21.999 --> 32:23.999
- I haven't slept in 24 hours.

32:23.999 --> 32:25.999
I'm coming home to
f***ing construction next door.

32:25.999 --> 32:26.999
I don't want to live here.

32:26.999 --> 32:27.999
I'm having my own issues
right now.

32:27.999 --> 32:29.999
- Would you stop making
everybody look like sh**

32:29.999 --> 32:30.999
because you're
too much of a pussy

32:30.999 --> 32:32.999
to admit
to your f***ing wrongdoings?

32:32.999 --> 32:33.999
- I'm not wrong.

32:33.999 --> 32:35.999
I don't have a ton of people
in this town

32:35.999 --> 32:36.999
to talk to.

32:36.999 --> 32:38.999
For me to lose my friend
would be huge to me.

32:38.999 --> 32:41.999
I don't have anything else.

32:41.999 --> 32:42.999
- What did you learn from this,
and where are you now?

32:42.999 --> 32:44.999
I mean, it's a slow process.

32:44.999 --> 32:46.999
I'm not--I'm far, far,
obviously, from perfect,

32:46.999 --> 32:48.999
and I need a lot of help.

32:48.999 --> 32:50.999
I do; I need a lot
of help from my friends.

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
I need a lot of help
from people, because, you know,

32:52.999 --> 32:54.999
I have tendencies
to do stupid sh**.

32:54.999 --> 32:56.999
- Try to remember
the way you feel

32:56.999 --> 32:58.000
when that guilt
overtakes you and just try

32:58.000 --> 32:59.999
to keep that stuff
from happening

32:59.999 --> 33:00.999
in the future, man.

33:00.999 --> 33:03.999
- I mean, I know that's, like,
Captain Hindsight talking, but--

33:03.999 --> 33:05.999
- Yeah.
I mean, it's been--

33:05.999 --> 33:07.000
since the incident, I mean,

33:07.000 --> 33:09.999
it hasn't been that long,
but it's been a good time.

33:09.999 --> 33:10.999
I mean, I really thank,
obviously,

33:10.999 --> 33:13.000
my wonderful girlfriend
for sticking by my side, and...

33:13.000 --> 33:14.999
- Possible wedding bells?

33:14.999 --> 33:16.999
I know in the show,
you were saying

33:16.999 --> 33:18.999
that's not something
that you're--

33:18.999 --> 33:21.999
- I'm just not fully on board
with marriage.

33:21.999 --> 33:24.999
- I want to know
that you would be willing to be

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
in a committed relationship.

33:26.999 --> 33:27.999
- Is this gonna
be an argument now?

33:27.999 --> 33:30.999
Like, are we
gonna go home in a fight?

33:30.999 --> 33:32.999
It's not you.

33:32.999 --> 33:33.999
It was just--
it's just the word "marriage."

33:33.999 --> 33:35.999
I just don't understand
why you need

33:35.999 --> 33:36.999
that piece of paper
to be in love,

33:36.999 --> 33:40.999
but I'm learning now
how it's very important to her,

33:40.999 --> 33:41.999
and now I'm kind of
changing my ways about it.

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
- Really?
- Yes, my mind has changed.

33:43.999 --> 33:44.999
I just never thought
I would really meet somebody

33:44.999 --> 33:46.999
that I care this much about.

33:46.999 --> 33:49.999
So it's important to her,
it's important to me, so...

33:49.999 --> 33:51.999
- Maybe he can steal her
a wedding ring.

33:51.999 --> 33:53.999
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That was bad.

33:53.999 --> 33:54.999
- No.
- Sorry.

33:54.999 --> 33:57.999
- Tom.

33:57.999 --> 33:59.999
- I just think
that Jax looks at Brittney,

33:59.999 --> 34:02.999
it almost makes him feel better
about himself

34:02.999 --> 34:06.999
that this darling girl
is kind of validating him,

34:06.999 --> 34:08.999
that you're, you know,
not such an ass****.

34:08.999 --> 34:11.999
- I think we bring out
the best in each other.

34:11.999 --> 34:14.999
And I think I'm turning him into
a much better person,

34:14.999 --> 34:15.999
if I say so myself.

34:15.999 --> 34:16.999
- Yeah, she is.

34:16.999 --> 34:18.999
- Well, Brittney,
it's been so fun meeting you.

34:18.999 --> 34:20.999
- Yeah, you too.
- Good luck.

34:20.999 --> 34:21.999
- Thank you.

34:21.999 --> 34:23.999
- Keep him on the straight
and narrow.

34:23.999 --> 34:24.999
- Yes, please.

34:24.999 --> 34:27.999
- When we come back, Stassi
joins the group after this.

34:29.999 --> 34:33.999
- The way that you talk to women
is so despicable,

34:33.999 --> 34:34.999
and there's no excuse for it.

34:34.999 --> 34:37.999
It made me embarrassed to be,
like, of the same species.

34:37.999 --> 34:39.999
- Oh, well,
good thing you weren't on

34:39.999 --> 34:40.999
the first 12 episodes then.

34:50.999 --> 34:53.999
- Back in West Hollywood
with the kids from Sur,

34:53.999 --> 34:56.999
and joining us is
Stassi Schroeder.

34:56.999 --> 34:57.999
- Hello.
- Hi, Stassi.

34:57.999 --> 34:58.999
- Hi.

34:58.999 --> 35:01.999
- The evolution
of Stassi Schroeder continues.

35:01.999 --> 35:02.999
- I got my boobs
reduced and lifted.

35:02.999 --> 35:04.999
- You got your boobs
reduced and lifted.

35:04.999 --> 35:06.999
- Yeah, I got my lips done.
- The chin?

35:06.999 --> 35:08.999
- Well, that was--
that was ten years ago.

35:08.999 --> 35:11.999
- The hair's obviously
quite blonde.

35:11.999 --> 35:12.999
- Well, it's never been real.
Let's be honest.

35:12.999 --> 35:15.999
- Okay, very good.

35:15.999 --> 35:17.999
How was it being back
with this group?

35:17.999 --> 35:19.999
- It was weird to watch, say,
the first 12 episodes

35:19.999 --> 35:22.999
or whatnot where I wasn't in it
and I wasn't around for it.

35:22.999 --> 35:25.999
- Right.
- And I have to say this.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
Like, I feel like--
James,

35:27.999 --> 35:29.999
I hope that you
watched that back

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
and realized that the way

35:31.999 --> 35:34.999
that you talk to women
is so despicable,

35:34.999 --> 35:36.999
and there's no excuse for it.

35:36.999 --> 35:39.999
- Ew.
You f***ing nasty slut, you are.

35:39.999 --> 35:41.000
- Get out of my apartment
before I call security.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.999
- Disgusting.
You smell bad.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
- You did not just
spit on my door.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.999
- Yeah, bitch.

35:46.999 --> 35:50.999
- It made me embarrassed to be,
like, of the same species.

35:50.999 --> 35:51.999
- Oh, well,
good thing you weren't on

35:51.999 --> 35:52.999
the first 12 episodes then.

35:52.999 --> 35:54.999
- For real, 'cause
I feel like I would've, like,

35:54.999 --> 35:56.999
done another backhand
or some situation.

35:56.999 --> 36:00.999
- Do you think you talk
down to women specifically?

36:00.999 --> 36:01.999
- No, I don't.

36:01.999 --> 36:04.999
I mean, honestly, what happens
is, I've got a temper,

36:04.999 --> 36:07.999
and I f***ing get
aggravated sometimes, you know?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.999
I understand what
I say is wrong,

36:09.999 --> 36:12.999
and, you know,
I'm trying to become

36:12.999 --> 36:14.999
a gentleman one day,
you know?

36:14.999 --> 36:15.999
That's what I want to be.

36:15.999 --> 36:17.999
- You spit on Kristen's door.

36:17.999 --> 36:20.999
You said she's ugly,
she smells.

36:20.999 --> 36:22.999
I find that kind of funny.

36:22.999 --> 36:24.999
- If you're saying you want
to turn into a gentleman

36:24.999 --> 36:26.999
but you're not acknowledging
that the way that you talk

36:26.999 --> 36:27.999
to women is wrong,
then, like, dude,

36:27.999 --> 36:28.999
you're not gonna get anywhere.

36:28.999 --> 36:29.999
- Not all women.
Not all women.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.999
Just some.

36:31.999 --> 36:33.999
I don't need to sit here
and just say,

36:33.999 --> 36:34.999
"I've been to therapy,
and I've changed,

36:34.999 --> 36:35.999
and I've become
a better person."

36:35.999 --> 36:38.000
Like, you'll see it
when you notice,

36:38.999 --> 36:39.999
and I don't need
to prove myself,

36:39.999 --> 36:40.999
especially to someone like you.

36:40.999 --> 36:41.999
- It will never happen.

36:41.999 --> 36:43.999
- Or you, Kristen.

36:43.999 --> 36:44.999
- Someone like me.

36:44.999 --> 36:46.999
- Being in the same room
with him right now

36:46.999 --> 36:48.999
is making my skin crawl.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.999
- Let me go back to Stassi.

36:50.999 --> 36:53.999
Exactly one year ago,
we sat in this room,

36:53.999 --> 36:59.999
and you said you never wanted to
see any of these people again.

36:59.999 --> 37:01.999
Stassi, it seems like
every time we see you,

37:01.999 --> 37:03.999
it's the last time
you're gonna see this group.

37:03.999 --> 37:05.999
Do you feel like when
you walk out today,

37:05.999 --> 37:08.999
it'll be the last time
you see everybody?

37:08.999 --> 37:11.999
- I'm really excited to get up
and walk out of this room.

37:11.999 --> 37:12.999
- You are?

37:12.999 --> 37:15.999
- I've been miserable
the whole entire time.

37:15.999 --> 37:18.999
- Yet you really
seem to humble yourself

37:18.999 --> 37:21.999
to get back
into their good graces.

37:21.999 --> 37:24.000
What happened?

37:24.999 --> 37:27.999
- As much
as I've been so sorry

37:27.999 --> 37:29.999
for the people
that I have hurt,

37:29.999 --> 37:31.999
I needed to kind of have
a rock-bottom moment.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.999
It took a while for me
to realize that I have, like,

37:33.999 --> 37:34.999
a heart full of,
like, anger and hate,

37:34.999 --> 37:35.999
and I'm only hurting myself.

37:35.999 --> 37:37.999
- That sounds familiar.

37:37.999 --> 37:39.999
I don't want to wake up
like you every morning

37:39.999 --> 37:40.999
with hatred and anger
in my heart.

37:40.999 --> 37:41.999
- I don't; you think I have
hatred in my heart?

37:41.999 --> 37:43.999
- Yes, because--

37:43.999 --> 37:44.999
- I don't think
about these people

37:44.999 --> 37:48.999
until I moved back,
and now I hate everything

37:48.999 --> 37:50.999
because I have to deal
with these people,

37:50.999 --> 37:53.999
and you are
the last link to them.

37:53.999 --> 37:56.999
- Jax, why do you think
Stassi went straight to Kristen?

37:56.999 --> 37:58.999
- It was a very tactical move,

37:58.999 --> 38:00.999
because Kristen was kind of
the weakest link.

38:00.999 --> 38:01.999
- Yep.

38:01.999 --> 38:03.999
- And I think it just seemed
like a safe move.

38:03.999 --> 38:04.999
- It seemed interesting

38:04.999 --> 38:07.999
that the two of you were able
to settle your beef

38:07.999 --> 38:09.999
and you wound up
on Kristen's couch.

38:09.999 --> 38:12.999
- Yeah, that's my issue.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
I feel like there was an agenda.

38:14.999 --> 38:16.999
I feel like the timing
says it all.

38:16.999 --> 38:18.999
- Tom, you can't stand Stassi,
can you?

38:18.999 --> 38:20.999
- It's not
that I can't stand Stassi.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.000
- He can't.
He hates me.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.999
- I have an issue when I feel
like something's wrong,

38:24.999 --> 38:25.999
and I have an issue when I feel
like

38:25.999 --> 38:27.999
somebody's
being manipulative.

38:27.999 --> 38:29.999
- You don't believe anything
I say or do.

38:29.999 --> 38:31.000
It's just, like, so annoying.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.999
- I'm just very protective,
you know?

38:33.999 --> 38:35.999
Like, when Katie went
through that stuff,

38:35.999 --> 38:38.999
like, we spent hours
and hours talking on,

38:38.999 --> 38:40.999
like, her balcony, my balcony,
like, late at night...

38:40.999 --> 38:42.999
- She was so upset, yeah.
- Texting back and forth.

38:42.999 --> 38:45.000
Like, me and Katie
got really f***ing close,

38:45.999 --> 38:46.999
and I f***ing care
for my friends, Stassi.

38:46.999 --> 38:48.999
That's where this comes from;
this doesn't come from, like,

38:48.999 --> 38:49.999
me wanting to bash you down.

38:49.999 --> 38:51.999
- I just--I f***ing love her,
man.

38:51.999 --> 38:53.999
- I appreciate that;
it just feels a little bit like

38:53.999 --> 38:55.999
no matter what I say,
you find fault with it.

38:55.999 --> 38:58.000
- Well, you did put them
all down as well,

38:58.000 --> 38:59.999
and you walked away,
and you put them down.

38:59.999 --> 39:00.999
- But I'm admitting that,
and I admitted that, like,

39:00.999 --> 39:02.999
400 motherf***ing times.

39:02.999 --> 39:04.999
- But just because you admit it
and then you say I'm sorry,

39:04.999 --> 39:06.999
it doesn't take away the hurt
that they felt.

39:06.999 --> 39:07.999
- And I completely agree
with you, and I understand that.

39:07.999 --> 39:09.999
- So it's just like,
"I can do this,

39:09.999 --> 39:11.999
"I can do that,
I can walk away for a year,

39:11.999 --> 39:12.999
"and then I come back,
and I say I'm sorry,

39:12.999 --> 39:13.999
"and guess what.

39:13.999 --> 39:15.000
You're all supposed
to forget it."

39:15.999 --> 39:16.999
- I--I've never said that.
I've never said--

39:16.999 --> 39:18.999
- Well,
so understand how he feels.

39:18.999 --> 39:21.999
- Jax, what do you think
Stassi's true motives were

39:21.999 --> 39:22.999
for coming back?

39:22.999 --> 39:24.999
- At the time,
I think you were having troubles

39:24.999 --> 39:25.999
with your relationship.

39:25.999 --> 39:26.999
I think there was, like,
an apartment move

39:27.000 --> 39:28.999
or something like that.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.999
I think maybe there was
a little maybe shortage

39:30.999 --> 39:31.999
of money coming around.

39:31.999 --> 39:33.999
- No. What? Jax--

39:33.999 --> 39:34.999
- And I feel like you were
missing your friends,

39:34.999 --> 39:36.999
and I feel like--
I think that's what it was.

39:36.999 --> 39:38.999
I think it was
kind of crumbling.

39:38.999 --> 39:39.999
It was crumbling.
- Yeah.

39:39.999 --> 39:40.999
- Because we don't know
what happened between--you know,

39:40.999 --> 39:42.999
the last time
you were talking sh**

39:42.999 --> 39:45.999
on all of us on the show--
What happened in your head

39:45.999 --> 39:46.999
that all of a sudden now
you're like, "I'm coming back."

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
We're like, "What?"

39:48.999 --> 39:49.999
Like, we don't know what--
we, like, we didn't talk to you,

39:49.999 --> 39:51.999
so we had no idea
what was going on with you.

39:51.999 --> 39:53.999
- I think
if there wasn't this show,

39:53.999 --> 39:57.999
none of you would've ever heard
from Stassi Schroeder again.

39:57.999 --> 39:58.999
How about that?
- Exactly.

39:58.999 --> 39:59.999
- Exactly.

40:11.999 --> 40:13.000
- Lisa,
you had some serious concerns

40:13.999 --> 40:15.999
about Stassi coming back
in the group.

40:15.999 --> 40:16.999
- Well, I--

40:16.999 --> 40:18.999
It was a very difficult
situation,

40:18.999 --> 40:20.999
and when she came to me,

40:20.999 --> 40:22.999
I thought for a moment,
you know,

40:22.999 --> 40:25.999
this is really genuine,
and I thought, "You know what?

40:25.999 --> 40:26.999
Maybe she's changed."

40:26.999 --> 40:30.999
And seeing you, I realize now
it was disingenuous.

40:30.999 --> 40:33.999
I've had your back.

40:33.999 --> 40:34.999
I wish I hadn't, to be honest.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.999
- She gave me a job
as a waitress.

40:37.999 --> 40:40.999
Like, what do I owe you again?

40:40.999 --> 40:43.999
Lisa, I am apologetic
about a lot that I have done,

40:43.999 --> 40:45.999
but that doesn't mean
that every feeling

40:45.999 --> 40:47.999
that I have goes away.

40:47.999 --> 40:49.999
That doesn't mean
that it's just

40:49.999 --> 40:51.999
I wholeheartedly am just
in love with you.

40:51.999 --> 40:52.999
- Well, I don't want you to be,

40:52.999 --> 40:55.999
Trust me, because the feeling's
not mutual.

40:55.999 --> 40:57.999
- At this point,
do you feel like

40:57.999 --> 41:00.999
you owe
Lisa Vanderpump anything?

41:00.999 --> 41:02.999
- I feel like I owe her respect.
- Oh, okay, I'll take it.

41:02.999 --> 41:03.999
- Do you feel
like you're giving her respect?

41:04.000 --> 41:05.999
- I'm trying to be respectful
as I fight,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.999
but it's--it's kind of hard.

41:08.999 --> 41:11.999
- Do you still think right now
that I've done nothing for you

41:11.999 --> 41:14.999
to put you where you are,
to give you the opportunities?

41:14.999 --> 41:16.999
- I feel that you hold things
over my head

41:17.000 --> 41:19.999
like I owe the rest of my life
to you all of the time,

41:19.999 --> 41:20.999
and I feel like that's not fair.

41:20.999 --> 41:21.999
- What do I want with the rest
of your life? Are you crazy?

41:21.999 --> 41:23.999
- So what are you grateful
to her--

41:23.999 --> 41:25.999
what are you grateful
to her for?

41:25.999 --> 41:27.999
- Of course I'm grateful
that I had a job at Sur,

41:27.999 --> 41:30.999
because this was where I grew up
and I made amazing friends here,

41:30.999 --> 41:33.999
and, of course, yes,
we have an amazing--

41:33.999 --> 41:34.999
we have amazing opportunities.

41:34.999 --> 41:38.999
- I begged you not to walk
away from all the opportunities,

41:38.999 --> 41:39.999
and you came to me,
and you said,

41:39.999 --> 41:41.999
"Thank you so much,"
and then you go and say,

41:41.999 --> 41:43.999
"What's she ever done for me?"

41:43.999 --> 41:44.999
How do you think
that makes me feel?

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
- Just because I respect you
doesn't mean that I'm going to

41:46.999 --> 41:48.999
not have
these feelings that I have.

41:48.999 --> 41:50.999
- No, you sat there saying,
"What has she ever done for me?

41:50.999 --> 41:52.999
I've served
crispy chicken for her."

41:52.999 --> 41:53.999
- It's embarrassing.
- I've done a lot for you.

41:53.999 --> 41:55.999
I begged you not to leave.

41:55.999 --> 41:57.000
I was totally supportive.
- I had to.

41:57.999 --> 41:58.000
I--I had to.

41:58.999 --> 41:59.999
- Okay, that's fine.

41:59.999 --> 42:00.999
- For my own, like, well-being,
I had to.

42:00.999 --> 42:01.999
But okay,
walk away from the show,

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
but I say don't walk away
from all your friends,

42:03.999 --> 42:06.999
and you just kind of--
you went away, you trashed--

42:06.999 --> 42:07.999
- I've made some mistakes.
I've said that.

42:07.999 --> 42:10.999
- Yeah, but--
and then as soon

42:10.999 --> 42:13.999
as the cameras were on you,
you trashed me again.

42:18.999 --> 42:22.999
- Next week, the "Vanderpump
Rules Reunion" concludes.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.999
- When she's having
what to me the equivalent

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
of a child having
a fit in the store,

42:26.999 --> 42:28.999
it drives me crazy,
and it pushes me away from her.

42:28.999 --> 42:29.999
- Oh, God.

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
- I don't know
what it is about Katie.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
I cannot stand her.

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
- I'm waiting for it, man.
- It's gonna happen.

42:35.999 --> 42:36.999
It's gonna happen.

42:36.999 --> 42:38.999
- This is like the ultimate
"who has the bigger dick?"

42:38.999 --> 42:40.999
- Here, let me get a half chub,
and I'll whip it out.

42:40.999 --> 42:41.999
I promise I will.

42:41.999 --> 42:42.999
- Rachel despises you.

42:42.999 --> 42:44.999
- Thank you.

42:44.999 --> 42:45.999
That's like saying
a Trump supporter despises me.

42:45.999 --> 42:47.999
- That's funny.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.999
- All of those old feelings

42:49.999 --> 42:52.999
of the three of them
and me came back.

42:52.999 --> 42:55.999
- How was it $900
and not $1,000?

42:55.999 --> 42:57.999
- Listen, I'm not good
at making a sex tape.

42:57.999 --> 42:59.999
It was only worth $900.

42:59.999 --> 43:02.000
- Why did you have sex
with James that night?

43:02.999 --> 43:03.999
- I tried to kind of
hear him out,

43:03.999 --> 43:04.999
and then he told me
he slept with Jenna.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.999
- And you still took your pants
off that night.

43:06.999 --> 43:07.999
- Ew.
- Oh, my God.

43:07.999 --> 43:09.999
- Jesus.
- That's disgusting.

43:09.999 --> 43:11.999
- Dude.
- All of you are ass****s.

43:11.999 --> 43:12.999
Ass****. Ass****.
Ass****. Ass****.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.999
