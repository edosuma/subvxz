WEBVTT

01:11.140 --> 01:12.244
Rourke?

01:18.078 --> 01:19.182
Rourke.

01:23.221 --> 01:24.463
Come back to us.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.297
Sorry.

01:30.297 --> 01:31.988
Drifted off for a second.

01:33.748 --> 01:35.095
The park?

01:39.168 --> 01:40.100
What about it?

01:42.136 --> 01:43.379
That's where you drift to,
isn't it?

01:45.139 --> 01:46.209
That park.

01:47.314 --> 01:48.660
That day.

01:50.869 --> 01:52.181
Take me back there.

01:55.184 --> 01:56.150
What do you see?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.436
<i>Dad.</i>

02:06.436 --> 02:07.748
Fix my braid.

02:09.474 --> 02:10.544
<i>Her hair.</i>

02:11.959 --> 02:13.305
I see her hair.

02:13.305 --> 02:14.755
Your daughter?

02:16.619 --> 02:17.999
Minnie.

02:17.999 --> 02:20.209
This is not a braid.

02:20.209 --> 02:21.451
This is a maze...

02:21.451 --> 02:24.558
that only your mother can solve.

02:24.558 --> 02:25.455
There you go.

02:25.455 --> 02:27.112
Thank you, Dad!

02:30.495 --> 02:33.222
<i>She was playing this game,</i>

02:33.222 --> 02:34.568
<i>where she would see</i>

02:34.568 --> 02:36.639
<i>how many times she could
spin around in one place</i>

02:36.639 --> 02:38.054
<i>before she fell over.</i>

02:39.814 --> 02:41.057
When did you see him?

02:46.683 --> 02:47.857
<i>I barely noticed him.</i>

02:49.755 --> 02:51.792
<i>I was just happy
to be with my daughter.</i>

02:56.383 --> 02:58.868
<i>I wasn't paying attention
for just...</i>

02:58.868 --> 03:00.387
<i>just for a second...</i>

03:02.492 --> 03:03.597
...and I turned around...

03:06.496 --> 03:07.394
<i>...and I didn't see her...</i>

03:09.568 --> 03:10.466
<i>...and I got up...</i>

03:12.330 --> 03:13.262
<i>...and I called out for her...</i>

03:17.093 --> 03:18.439
...and I looked for her,

03:18.439 --> 03:19.820
and I c-- I c--

03:26.620 --> 03:28.069
She was gone.

03:34.628 --> 03:35.594
Rourke?

03:38.632 --> 03:39.943
I was there.

03:43.706 --> 03:44.914
There was nothing you could do.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.168
Work?

03:58.168 --> 03:59.653
Uh...

03:59.653 --> 04:01.448
That depends on you, I guess.

04:01.448 --> 04:04.036
Uh, if you think
I'm ready for duty.

04:05.797 --> 04:07.454
Do you feel ready, emotionally?

04:10.560 --> 04:12.113
I think it's the only thing
keeping me sane.

04:57.227 --> 04:59.644
<i>Though the missing child
has not been recovered,</i>

04:59.644 --> 05:01.162
<i>a suspect is in custody</i>

05:01.162 --> 05:02.474
<i>for the abduction</i>

05:02.474 --> 05:04.096
<i>of a police detective's
daughter.</i>

05:08.308 --> 05:10.896
<i>Alleged kidnapper,
18-year old Lyle Terry,</i>

05:10.896 --> 05:13.865
<i>has pled not guilty
due to mental incapacity,</i>

05:13.865 --> 05:15.349
<i>his lawyers insisting</i>

05:15.349 --> 05:17.558
<i>he has no memory whatsoever
of the incident,</i>

05:17.558 --> 05:19.698
<i>nor of Minnie's
current whereabouts</i>

05:19.698 --> 05:21.355
<i>or final resting place.</i>

05:35.369 --> 05:36.991
What, you lose something, compadre?

05:36.991 --> 05:38.476
Cockroach.

05:38.476 --> 05:39.994
Yeah. It's a hot day.

05:39.994 --> 05:41.064
Damn things are everywhere.

05:42.411 --> 05:43.929
Hey, did you wipe your shoes?

05:55.182 --> 05:56.390
So how did it go in there?

05:56.390 --> 05:57.426
You good?

05:57.426 --> 05:58.530
Yeah. No problem.

05:58.530 --> 06:00.394
I'm all clear for duty.
What's the call?

06:00.394 --> 06:02.603
Oh, it's a fun one.

06:02.603 --> 06:04.294
Anonymous tip
came into dispatch.

06:04.294 --> 06:05.330
Blocked number.

06:07.194 --> 06:08.747
<i>I'm calling to report a robbery.</i>

06:08.747 --> 06:10.887
<i>Are you in a safe location?</i>

06:10.887 --> 06:11.854
<i>Nobody's safe.</i>

06:11.854 --> 06:13.303
Nice line.

06:13.303 --> 06:15.029
Just wait.

06:15.029 --> 06:17.135
<i>Is this crime
currently in progress?</i>

06:17.135 --> 06:18.861
<i>Today, the Bank of Austin.</i>

06:18.861 --> 06:20.966
<i>There's a safe-deposit box.</i>

06:20.966 --> 06:22.796
<i>Box 23.</i>

06:22.796 --> 06:24.314
<i>Box 2-3.
Is that the target?</i>

06:26.040 --> 06:27.145
<i>Hello?</i>

06:27.145 --> 06:28.284
Flair for drama.

06:28.284 --> 06:29.941
You're thinking it's a prank.
I get it.

06:29.941 --> 06:30.976
That's what I thought, too.

06:30.976 --> 06:32.909
Except?

06:32.909 --> 06:34.428
Two armed robberies this week

06:34.428 --> 06:35.602
at Bank of Austin

06:35.602 --> 06:37.466
at branches
Houston and Amarillo.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.952
Both inside jobs
involving people with access.

06:40.952 --> 06:42.574
Both hit the safe-deposit boxes,

06:42.574 --> 06:44.231
but take only one box

06:44.231 --> 06:46.336
and no money at all.

06:46.336 --> 06:48.131
No shit?

06:48.131 --> 06:49.201
Captain put us on stakeout.

07:08.566 --> 07:09.498
Getting audio.

07:11.327 --> 07:12.501
<i>A guy goes up
to the bartender,</i>

07:12.501 --> 07:13.916
<i>and he says,</i>

07:13.916 --> 07:15.469
<i>"Hey, bartender.
I got me a bet for you.</i>

07:15.469 --> 07:17.747
<i>"I'm going to bet you
300 bucks</i>

07:17.747 --> 07:20.129
<i>that I can piss into
that glass over there,</i>

07:20.129 --> 07:21.164
<i>and not spill..."</i>

07:21.164 --> 07:22.442
All right, come on.
Move on.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.478
- Wait. This is a good one.
- <i>The bartender looks...</i>

07:24.478 --> 07:25.928
- I don't know, it.
- Hey! I said, move on.

07:25.928 --> 07:26.860
<i>...piss into, something like--</i>

07:31.347 --> 07:33.211
He pisses on the bartender.

07:33.211 --> 07:34.868
- No kidding.
- It's a whole thing.

07:34.868 --> 07:36.145
Yeah, it's a good one.

07:43.842 --> 07:44.878
See that guy on the bench?

07:47.639 --> 07:49.330
He looks familiar.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.815
<i>No. No.</i>

07:50.815 --> 07:51.816
<i>The city contracts.</i>

07:51.816 --> 07:53.507
You know this guy?

07:53.507 --> 07:55.060
-  <i>Thanks.</i>
- Not sure.

07:55.060 --> 07:55.992
<i>Do you have a lighter?</i>

07:58.892 --> 08:00.203
Quite masculine.

08:00.203 --> 08:01.481
Is it yours?

08:01.481 --> 08:02.999
My husband gave it to me.

08:02.999 --> 08:03.931
I don't smoke.

08:05.312 --> 08:07.521
He's got you
under his spell, doesn't he?

08:07.521 --> 08:08.695
Yes, he does.

08:11.974 --> 08:13.216
It's very hot today.

08:15.702 --> 08:16.772
<i>I didn't notice.</i>

08:18.221 --> 08:19.671
Trust me, it's like a furnace.

08:24.365 --> 08:25.884
Great. We got the weather.

08:25.884 --> 08:27.196
Can we move on now?

08:27.196 --> 08:28.093
That guy's up to something.

08:28.093 --> 08:29.405
Zoom in.

08:33.236 --> 08:35.135
<i>It's a sunny day.</i>

08:36.239 --> 08:38.069
You see that?

08:38.069 --> 08:39.242
He's speaking in code.

08:40.934 --> 08:42.314
The guards are in on it.

08:44.040 --> 08:44.938
Hey! Rourke! Wait!

08:49.011 --> 08:49.943
So hot.

08:53.671 --> 08:55.258
He's going for the bank.

08:55.258 --> 08:56.639
Don't walk into
that bank, Rourke.

08:57.675 --> 08:58.917
<i>We don't know
if that's the guy.</i>

09:00.609 --> 09:02.058
It's like a furnace.

09:04.682 --> 09:06.062
<i>Watch the woman.</i>

09:06.062 --> 09:07.408
I'll send back-up.

09:07.408 --> 09:08.755
Do not follow.

09:08.755 --> 09:09.825
<i>Yeah, roger that.</i>

09:17.936 --> 09:19.489
Danny, get out of that bank.

09:21.284 --> 09:22.389
Can I help you, sir?

09:22.389 --> 09:23.942
<i>I repeat, do not break--</i>

09:27.774 --> 09:30.949
You know I'd like to open
a safe-deposit box.

09:30.949 --> 09:32.019
<i>Right this way.</i>

09:37.646 --> 09:39.095
It's so hot.

09:39.095 --> 09:40.303
It's like a furnace.

10:00.323 --> 10:01.946
If you just fill this out,

10:01.946 --> 10:03.223
we'll get you set right up.

10:04.534 --> 10:06.260
Shoot. Excuse me.

10:06.260 --> 10:07.814
I must have left
my keys in my office.

10:07.814 --> 10:08.815
I'll be right back.

10:08.815 --> 10:09.850
Thank you.

10:16.201 --> 10:17.513
Here you go.
Have a great day.

10:22.104 --> 10:23.001
Good morning, sir.

10:24.278 --> 10:25.625
Morning?

10:25.625 --> 10:26.591
It's late afternoon.

10:31.389 --> 10:32.873
It is late afternoon.

10:53.238 --> 10:54.239
Minnie.

11:17.504 --> 11:18.436
Stop. Police.

11:20.887 --> 11:21.957
Stop.

11:24.891 --> 11:27.100
I said, stop where you are.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.135
Stop!

12:04.447 --> 12:05.345
Oh, shit!

12:44.936 --> 12:46.593
- Rourke!
- Send back-up!

12:46.593 --> 12:47.974
Go. Go!

13:13.723 --> 13:14.690
Do you mind?

13:30.016 --> 13:31.086
Stop!

13:45.997 --> 13:47.171
Hands up, asshole!

13:47.171 --> 13:48.344
Don't move!

13:49.967 --> 13:50.899
Cuff him.

13:59.562 --> 14:01.426
What are you waiting for?
Cuff him.

14:02.531 --> 14:03.566
But I'm the wrong man.

14:09.331 --> 14:10.435
He's the wrong man.

14:10.435 --> 14:11.471
What?

14:13.887 --> 14:15.578
You crooked bastards.
Who do you work for?

14:15.578 --> 14:17.753
Don't blame them, Detective.

14:17.753 --> 14:19.789
They're no more
conscious of themselves

14:19.789 --> 14:22.275
than Lyle Terry was.

14:26.348 --> 14:27.659
That was his name, wasn't it?

14:29.213 --> 14:31.871
The pawn who took your queen.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.080
Where is she?

14:40.638 --> 14:41.811
Give that to me.

14:43.054 --> 14:44.780
Where is she?
What does it mean?

14:44.780 --> 14:45.643
Who's Lev Dellrayne?

14:47.403 --> 14:48.404
What the hell?

14:51.200 --> 14:52.132
Clean this up, detectives.

14:56.412 --> 14:57.931
No!

15:18.296 --> 15:19.263
Nobody saw him flee the scene?

15:20.471 --> 15:21.990
We put out an APB.
Still nothing.

15:21.990 --> 15:24.061
The guards? Crew?

15:24.061 --> 15:25.683
Teller woman?
Anything?

15:25.683 --> 15:26.822
The ones that survive

15:26.822 --> 15:29.790
claim they can't
remember anything.

15:29.790 --> 15:30.688
Just like Lyle Terry.

15:30.688 --> 15:31.620
Danny.

15:31.620 --> 15:32.793
He said his name, Nicks.

15:34.519 --> 15:35.935
He had this picture
of my daughter

15:35.935 --> 15:37.695
in a safe-deposit box.

15:37.695 --> 15:39.007
You want to explain that to me?

15:40.249 --> 15:41.388
All right. That story
was all over the news.

15:42.631 --> 15:44.357
A cop's kid gets abducted.

15:45.772 --> 15:47.084
For all we know,
this is some sick joke.

15:47.084 --> 15:49.983
Someone messing with you,
messing with us.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.951
Hell, our own guys
were in on this one.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.539
I saw the way he looked at me.

15:54.539 --> 15:55.575
He knows.

15:57.197 --> 15:58.612
He knows where my daughter is.

15:58.612 --> 15:59.544
I'm sure of it.

16:04.377 --> 16:05.343
All right.

16:06.517 --> 16:08.346
How do we catch the bastard?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.072
Hey. What's up?

16:44.072 --> 16:46.039
Promise me I'm not an idiot
for trusting you.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.834
What do you got?

16:47.834 --> 16:50.561
That call that came in,
that tipped us to the bank?

16:50.561 --> 16:52.252
Blocked number, no I.D.?

16:52.252 --> 16:53.943
Ran a trace.

16:53.943 --> 16:54.875
We got an address.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.084
Oh.

16:56.084 --> 16:57.533
<i>A storefront out on Chapel.</i>

16:57.533 --> 16:58.879
I shouldn't be
doing this, Rourke.

16:58.879 --> 17:00.364
<i>I haven't even
told the Cap yet.</i>

17:00.364 --> 17:01.744
Text it to me.
I'll be right there.

17:04.540 --> 17:07.060
<i>The call came from
the phone of Diana Cruz,</i>

17:07.060 --> 17:08.786
<i>a dime-store psychic</i>

17:08.786 --> 17:11.030
<i>with a few arrests
for mail fraud.</i>

17:11.030 --> 17:12.272
<i>No convictions.</i>

17:18.865 --> 17:20.867
You're in front of the house.

17:20.867 --> 17:23.007
You go up the steps.

17:25.423 --> 17:27.253
You step through the door...

17:27.253 --> 17:28.771
and you see her there.

17:30.566 --> 17:33.190
She's holding
something in her arms.

17:33.190 --> 17:35.399
It's a baby.

17:35.399 --> 17:36.572
She's holding you.

17:40.369 --> 17:41.612
I love you, Mama.

17:43.752 --> 17:45.098
I'm sorry.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.655
Is it over?

17:50.655 --> 17:52.485
What happened?

17:52.485 --> 17:54.107
- We have company.

17:55.660 --> 17:56.730
Good evening, ma'am.

17:56.730 --> 17:57.731
Austin Police Department.

17:57.731 --> 17:58.974
I'd like to speak with you.

17:58.974 --> 17:59.906
How can I help you, Officer?

17:59.906 --> 18:01.666
Detective, actually,

18:01.666 --> 18:03.461
and, uh...

18:03.461 --> 18:04.428
Hello.

18:05.774 --> 18:07.396
This piggy bothering you, Di?

18:07.396 --> 18:09.329
It's cool, Tiny.

18:09.329 --> 18:10.641
I can handle him.

18:12.608 --> 18:13.678
I'll be outside.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.272
I'll just take
a few minutes of your time.

18:22.756 --> 18:24.172
Sure.

18:34.941 --> 18:37.392
He'll be out there on his bike
until you leave.

18:38.496 --> 18:40.429
Oh. Loyal customer.

18:40.429 --> 18:42.328
I inspire that in people.

18:42.328 --> 18:45.054
Detective Rourke, isn't it?

18:45.054 --> 18:47.056
Well, that's
some impressive mind-reading.

18:47.056 --> 18:48.506
I just read the news.

18:49.714 --> 18:51.199
You're the one
who lost his kid.

18:53.270 --> 18:54.719
Must have been awful.

18:54.719 --> 18:58.620
If you're open to a session,
hypnosis can be therapeutic.

18:58.620 --> 18:59.862
Confronting the past.

18:59.862 --> 19:02.313
I'm interested in your past.

19:02.313 --> 19:04.073
Diana Cruz,

19:04.073 --> 19:07.042
accused of bilking clients
in Laredo, San Antonio.

19:07.042 --> 19:08.837
Packed up shop
and moved down here.

19:08.837 --> 19:10.287
Those charges were lies.

19:10.287 --> 19:12.289
I'm not bunko. Okay?

19:12.289 --> 19:13.566
I'm not here to bust you.

19:13.566 --> 19:15.084
I just want to know

19:15.084 --> 19:16.396
how a two-bit con artist
like you

19:16.396 --> 19:18.260
got involved with Lev Dellrayne.

19:19.641 --> 19:21.229
I know you called the tip in
on the bank heist.

19:31.756 --> 19:32.895
Did you catch someone?

19:32.895 --> 19:33.793
Not yet.
They got away.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.105
Then you need to leave.

19:37.383 --> 19:38.487
Why don't you come
to the station with me?

19:38.487 --> 19:39.764
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

19:39.764 --> 19:41.180
Then get out.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.320
- I can see you're afraid--
- Get the hell out of here.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.597
You know what?

19:44.597 --> 19:45.770
Why don't you tell me
what you're afraid of?

19:45.770 --> 19:47.772
You stay. I'm out.

19:47.772 --> 19:48.877
I can protect you.

19:48.877 --> 19:50.050
You don't know anything.

19:50.050 --> 19:51.431
I know I saw him at the bank.
Didn't I?

19:52.777 --> 19:54.054
Lev Dellrayne.

20:04.133 --> 20:05.859
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

20:05.859 --> 20:07.344
Thank you.

20:07.344 --> 20:08.793
He was sent to kill us.

20:10.416 --> 20:11.520
Who are you?

20:11.520 --> 20:12.418
Hey!

20:15.248 --> 20:16.732
He won't tell you anything.

20:16.732 --> 20:18.665
I can be
pretty persuasive myself.

20:23.636 --> 20:25.120
He...

20:25.120 --> 20:26.432
won't...

20:26.432 --> 20:27.605
stop.

20:50.732 --> 20:52.665
I didn't think
you were arresting me.

20:52.665 --> 20:54.149
I'm not.

20:54.149 --> 20:55.633
We use this
for storage nowadays.

20:55.633 --> 20:56.772
You'll be safe here.

20:56.772 --> 20:59.258
Nicks, run the vic's I.D...

20:59.258 --> 21:00.604
Look for past gang affiliations,

21:00.604 --> 21:01.846
former cellmates.

21:01.846 --> 21:03.641
There's got to be
some connection to Dellrayne.

21:03.641 --> 21:04.504
All we've got to do is find it.

21:10.199 --> 21:12.201
Let's keep her
out of it for now.

21:12.201 --> 21:14.273
The Captain
will be asking questions.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.653
Tell her I'm working on it.

21:17.483 --> 21:20.658
We're going to run priors
on your biker friend.

21:20.658 --> 21:22.626
Whatever connection he has
or link to Dellrayne,

21:22.626 --> 21:23.696
I'm sure it will come up.

21:23.696 --> 21:25.111
You won't find anything.

21:25.111 --> 21:27.113
You might be surprised.

21:27.113 --> 21:29.322
You think learning who he is
will tell you why he did it?

21:29.322 --> 21:30.979
What other motive is there?

21:32.946 --> 21:34.603
What makes four total strangers

21:34.603 --> 21:37.537
pull off an elaborate
bank heist on a whim?

21:40.022 --> 21:41.507
I'm guessing you're going
to say Lev Dellrayne.

21:42.715 --> 21:43.819
Why don't you tell me who he is?

21:43.819 --> 21:45.165
What does he have
on these people?

21:45.165 --> 21:46.339
Are you familiar

21:46.339 --> 21:48.376
with the concept
of hypnotic constructs?

21:50.723 --> 21:53.035
Look, lady, come on.

21:53.035 --> 21:55.348
First, it's, uh,
fortune telling.

21:55.348 --> 21:56.453
Now it's hypnosis.

21:56.453 --> 21:58.075
- I--
- It's not hypnosis.

21:59.456 --> 22:00.733
Hypnotics have abilities

22:00.733 --> 22:02.700
far beyond anything
we have a name for.

22:02.700 --> 22:03.874
"Hypnotics"?

22:03.874 --> 22:05.634
People with the ability

22:05.634 --> 22:09.362
to actually influence the brain
over a psychic bandwidth.

22:09.362 --> 22:10.639
Like telepathy?

22:10.639 --> 22:12.365
Telepaths just read the mind.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.402
Hypnotics reshape its reality.

22:15.886 --> 22:17.508
The guy at the bank,

22:17.508 --> 22:20.994
you said he spoke four words
to a woman and she undressed.

22:20.994 --> 22:22.927
Because she was in on it.

22:22.927 --> 22:24.032
No.

22:24.032 --> 22:26.483
Those were cues--

22:26.483 --> 22:28.968
sound, voice, locking eyes.

22:30.107 --> 22:31.039
Hypnotics use them

22:31.039 --> 22:32.247
to make you see

22:32.247 --> 22:34.283
a version of the world
that doesn't exist.

22:35.595 --> 22:38.736
Your behavior conforms
with this hypnotic construct,

22:38.736 --> 22:41.360
so everything
that you see and do

22:41.360 --> 22:42.947
feels perfectly normal.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.124
How is it that you know
so much about these hypnotics?

22:48.884 --> 22:50.852
Because I am one.

22:50.852 --> 22:51.784
Bullshit.

22:53.682 --> 22:54.718
A cynic.

22:54.718 --> 22:56.754
Mind control?

22:56.754 --> 22:59.239
Dream bank accounts?

22:59.239 --> 23:00.309
Sounds more like my ex-wife.

23:00.309 --> 23:02.208
Take it easy, Nicks.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.624
We just watched two cops
blow each other's brains out,

23:04.624 --> 23:05.936
and she's saying
it's some Vegas act.

23:07.316 --> 23:08.179
She's playing us.

23:10.630 --> 23:11.735
Why don't you
have a seat, Nicks?

23:23.574 --> 23:24.748
You're a prisoner.

23:26.163 --> 23:27.475
Act like one.

23:34.136 --> 23:35.379
Nicks?

23:37.830 --> 23:39.487
Oh, God.

23:41.661 --> 23:42.628
Hey. Nicks!

23:43.732 --> 23:44.802
Let's cut the shit out.

23:44.802 --> 23:45.872
Stop that,
whatever you're doing.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.357
Why don't you get some air?

23:52.810 --> 23:53.846
Hey, you know what?

23:53.846 --> 23:55.641
I could use some air.

24:00.024 --> 24:01.129
I'll be outside.

24:04.097 --> 24:05.789
Don't worry, Detective.

24:05.789 --> 24:06.962
I already tried it on you.

24:08.516 --> 24:09.724
It didn't work.

24:11.035 --> 24:12.036
Who the hell are you?

24:13.969 --> 24:16.109
Just get me some coffee.

24:16.109 --> 24:17.456
Maybe I'll tell you.

24:31.677 --> 24:32.988
Need a light?

24:41.859 --> 24:43.412
They were looking for people

24:43.412 --> 24:46.277
who thought they had
above-normal intuitive ability.

24:48.521 --> 24:51.041
I usually make some money
reading tarot.

24:51.041 --> 24:53.250
They were offering 50 bucks.

24:53.250 --> 24:55.252
I thought, "What the hell?"
and took the test.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.083
A week later,

24:59.083 --> 25:01.638
there were two suits
waiting in my dorm room.

25:01.638 --> 25:02.604
Feds?

25:04.364 --> 25:06.194
They said
I could finish my degree,

25:06.194 --> 25:07.989
rack up more student debt,

25:07.989 --> 25:09.093
or I could come with them

25:09.093 --> 25:10.819
and earn six figures
in six months.

25:10.819 --> 25:12.683
That's not a government salary.

25:12.683 --> 25:14.236
The Division started

25:14.236 --> 25:16.929
as a privately-run
U.S. government program,

25:16.929 --> 25:19.725
developing methods
to influence political outcomes.

25:19.725 --> 25:20.691
Defense contractor.

25:20.691 --> 25:22.451
Defense, offense,

25:22.451 --> 25:24.039
whatever needed doing.

25:24.039 --> 25:25.282
The Division advanced

25:25.282 --> 25:27.249
American interests
around the world,

25:27.249 --> 25:29.286
but then they discovered

25:29.286 --> 25:30.805
the hypnotic ability
within humans...

25:32.254 --> 25:34.567
...and that this ability
could be trained.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.465
Improved upon.

25:36.465 --> 25:39.883
Hypnotics had a way
to get it done without receipts.

25:39.883 --> 25:40.815
What about Dellrayne?

25:41.885 --> 25:43.472
He was the legend.

25:43.472 --> 25:45.716
The most powerful hypnotic
ever trained.

25:45.716 --> 25:47.718
All of us were amateurs
compared to him.

25:48.926 --> 25:50.238
But then he went rogue.

25:50.238 --> 25:51.722
Dellrayne believed

25:51.722 --> 25:54.483
that only he could realize
the hypnotic's true potential,

25:54.483 --> 25:56.451
and tried to take over
the Division.

25:57.970 --> 26:00.179
I was one of the agents
who stood in his way.

26:01.698 --> 26:03.044
Division locked him up.

26:03.044 --> 26:05.046
I knew it wouldn't last.

26:05.046 --> 26:06.565
So I made it out.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.566
Cut ties.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.257
Started fresh.

26:09.257 --> 26:10.327
Last week,

26:10.327 --> 26:12.398
when I read about the robberies,

26:12.398 --> 26:14.434
the other banks,

26:14.434 --> 26:16.713
and that no one
even remembered him,

26:16.713 --> 26:18.784
I knew that it was Dellrayne...

26:20.061 --> 26:21.131
...and I also knew

26:21.131 --> 26:23.512
that no one
who knows that he exists

26:23.512 --> 26:25.238
is safe.

26:25.238 --> 26:26.515
Especially you.

26:28.897 --> 26:30.623
He can't be caught.

26:35.455 --> 26:36.560
Stay here.

26:49.262 --> 26:50.332
Nicks?

26:52.611 --> 26:53.542
Nicks, it's me.

27:00.826 --> 27:01.999
Nicks?

27:03.276 --> 27:04.415
Put the gun down, Nicks.

27:06.141 --> 27:07.004
It's not him anymore.

27:08.557 --> 27:09.317
Do something.
Wake him up.

27:10.490 --> 27:12.320
Dellrayne is doing this.
I'm not strong enough.

27:12.320 --> 27:13.252
Nicks, put it down.

27:14.805 --> 27:16.255
Nicks, stop where you are!

27:19.465 --> 27:20.224
Nicks, stop or I'll shoot!

27:20.224 --> 27:21.640
Do it!

27:21.640 --> 27:22.779
Rourke!

27:28.543 --> 27:30.683
Okay, buddy.
Are you all right? It's me.

27:30.683 --> 27:31.995
You okay?
You all right?

27:31.995 --> 27:33.513
You're all right.

27:33.513 --> 27:34.618
I got you in the leg.
You're okay.

27:46.526 --> 27:47.838
He won't stop

27:47.838 --> 27:49.771
until he accomplishes
what he's been told to do.

28:01.403 --> 28:03.095
Rourke, we need to go.

28:05.822 --> 28:06.961
Nicks.

28:08.376 --> 28:10.274
Stop, Nicks.
Stop. Nicks.

28:10.274 --> 28:11.206
Hey! Wake up!

28:12.587 --> 28:14.554
He's too far gone.

28:14.554 --> 28:16.384
Nicks.

28:16.384 --> 28:17.385
He'll kill us both.

28:17.385 --> 28:18.904
Nicks, this isn't you.

28:21.009 --> 28:22.045
Nicks!

28:23.563 --> 28:24.772
- He'll pull his hand off!
- Nicks!

28:25.945 --> 28:26.981
Rourke!

28:28.465 --> 28:29.569
Nicks!

28:45.068 --> 28:46.379
Put the gun down.

28:46.379 --> 28:47.898
Put it down!

28:50.659 --> 28:52.144
You killed him.

28:52.144 --> 28:53.524
He was already dead.

28:55.561 --> 28:56.735
He was already dead.

28:58.046 --> 28:59.082
I set him free.

29:09.402 --> 29:11.232
Nicks?

29:11.232 --> 29:12.371
Nicks...

29:37.534 --> 29:38.707
<i>A veteran police detective,</i>

29:38.707 --> 29:39.916
<i>Daniel Rourke,</i>

29:39.916 --> 29:41.952
<i>is wanted with another suspect
seen here,</i>

29:41.952 --> 29:43.022
<i>in connection</i>

29:43.022 --> 29:44.817
<i>with the execution-style slaying</i>

29:44.817 --> 29:47.820
<i>of his former partner,
Randy Nicks.</i>

29:47.820 --> 29:49.926
<i>Police detective Daniel Rourke's
missing daughter...</i>

29:49.926 --> 29:52.204
He had a wife.
Two kids.

29:52.204 --> 29:54.482
We had no choice.

29:54.482 --> 29:56.346
They think I killed him.

29:56.346 --> 29:58.141
That's exactly
what Dellrayne wants.

29:58.141 --> 29:59.798
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

30:01.454 --> 30:02.870
I know he took my daughter.

30:05.217 --> 30:06.356
What do you mean?

30:13.501 --> 30:15.296
This was, uh...

30:15.296 --> 30:18.299
in the safe-deposit box
at the bank.

30:18.299 --> 30:19.748
It's what Dellrayne came for.

30:24.719 --> 30:26.065
You don't understand
what it's like.

30:30.311 --> 30:31.553
They never found her body.

30:39.907 --> 30:42.047
The guy they arrested...

30:42.047 --> 30:43.945
swears he doesn't even remember
the kidnapping.

30:45.429 --> 30:46.637
I always thought he was lying.

30:50.572 --> 30:51.919
What if he was
telling the truth?

30:54.507 --> 30:56.302
What if my daughter's
still out there?

31:04.793 --> 31:05.794
Morning, Luz.

31:05.794 --> 31:07.003
Morning.

31:07.003 --> 31:09.522
Just give me a couple of them
breakfast tacos,

31:09.522 --> 31:11.524
extra chorizo.

31:11.524 --> 31:12.525
Coffee?

31:12.525 --> 31:13.802
Black and sludgy.

31:33.650 --> 31:35.100
Call it in.

31:41.485 --> 31:42.762
You just saw us heading north.

31:46.042 --> 31:47.802
Dispatch.

31:47.802 --> 31:50.943
This is Tex DPS calling
to report two fugitives.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.496
Male and female

31:52.496 --> 31:55.948
heading north on I35
from Stonewall Trail.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.916
He'll get the check.

32:00.504 --> 32:01.712
Be generous.

32:02.748 --> 32:03.783
Luz?

32:05.578 --> 32:08.719
It's about time that I finally
gave you a decent tip.

32:10.100 --> 32:11.308
<i>This is dispatch.</i>

32:12.689 --> 32:15.312
<i>Two officers are arriving
at your location now.</i>

32:17.521 --> 32:18.867
<i>I found you, Diana.</i>

32:29.119 --> 32:30.051
Find us a way out of here.

32:31.259 --> 32:32.329
I have what he wants.

32:32.329 --> 32:33.710
- No.
- I'll distract him.

32:33.710 --> 32:35.608
Rourke! No!
He'll kill you!

32:35.608 --> 32:36.713
Rourke!

32:39.026 --> 32:39.992
Shit!

34:15.777 --> 34:16.744
Ready to go?

34:19.781 --> 34:20.851
Get out.

34:31.931 --> 34:33.036
- That's a way out.
- Yeah.

34:40.595 --> 34:41.838
A construct makes you see

34:41.838 --> 34:43.495
what the hypnotic
wants you to see.

34:44.737 --> 34:46.498
It can look like anything.

34:46.498 --> 34:49.673
It's whatever makes you do
the behavior they want.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.918
But you're different.

34:52.918 --> 34:54.126
Why?

34:54.126 --> 34:55.162
You have a block, Detective.

34:55.162 --> 34:56.611
A psychic block.

34:57.785 --> 34:59.269
A hypnotic's worst nightmare.

34:59.269 --> 35:03.411
Everyone's subconscious mind
puts up a barrier to entry.

35:03.411 --> 35:04.619
For most people,

35:04.619 --> 35:06.345
it's a padlock,

35:06.345 --> 35:08.658
or a simple
one, two, three code.

35:09.866 --> 35:11.419
Yours...

35:11.419 --> 35:14.664
is locked inside a vault,
buried in a bunker 10 feet deep.

35:15.837 --> 35:17.460
I guess I'm lucky
I'm such a head case.

35:17.460 --> 35:19.807
Your block
could come from anywhere.

35:19.807 --> 35:21.464
Scar tissue.

35:21.464 --> 35:22.810
Emotional trauma.

35:24.052 --> 35:25.364
Your daughter maybe.

35:28.540 --> 35:30.128
Pain can keep the mind awake.

35:31.957 --> 35:33.648
But the bottom line is,

35:33.648 --> 35:35.305
I can't get to you...

35:35.305 --> 35:36.824
but Dellrayne can.

36:02.056 --> 36:03.575
Excuse me, Officer.

36:05.197 --> 36:06.440
Which way is Mexico?

36:15.725 --> 36:17.589
Bet you've never gotten
a speeding ticket either.

36:17.589 --> 36:18.555
Nope.

36:31.085 --> 36:33.225
Jeremiah was my handler
in the Division,

36:33.225 --> 36:35.054
Southwest Station Chief.

36:35.054 --> 36:36.504
Strong hypnotic?

36:36.504 --> 36:38.230
He's not one, actually.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.749
Just a mean old bastard

36:39.749 --> 36:41.060
with a psychic block

36:41.060 --> 36:43.131
that makes yours...

36:43.131 --> 36:44.719
look like
a childproof safety cap.

36:44.719 --> 36:46.963
So you can't influence him?

36:46.963 --> 36:49.379
Not for long
before he spots the gap.

36:49.379 --> 36:50.484
Only Dellrayne ever could.

36:52.071 --> 36:53.935
This guy can help us catch him.

36:55.523 --> 36:57.422
Is your gun loaded?

36:57.422 --> 36:58.388
I thought this guy liked you.

36:59.527 --> 37:00.977
He loved me like a daughter,

37:00.977 --> 37:03.117
but I didn't split
with the Division

37:03.117 --> 37:04.222
on the best of terms.

37:05.292 --> 37:06.603
I left him hogtied
in a bathtub.

37:07.880 --> 37:09.296
Got it.

37:24.172 --> 37:25.553
Maria, la puerta!

37:29.108 --> 37:30.386
-¿Quién es?

37:30.386 --> 37:31.490
Stop, stop, stop.

37:32.836 --> 37:33.803
Get back.

37:38.635 --> 37:39.809
It's open.

37:41.742 --> 37:42.639
Hands up, jackass.

37:50.302 --> 37:51.786
¿Ahora quién es el pendejo?

37:54.582 --> 37:56.135
You sneaky bitch.

37:58.414 --> 37:59.622
You taught me well.

38:00.692 --> 38:02.797
Yes, I did.

38:02.797 --> 38:05.110
Well, looks like you've got
a student of your own now.

38:05.110 --> 38:06.525
Where-- Where is Maria?

38:06.525 --> 38:08.389
On a beach somewhere,
making a sandcastle.

38:11.703 --> 38:12.738
Hmm. Lucky her.

38:14.119 --> 38:15.362
There's tamales in the fridge.

38:15.362 --> 38:16.708
Help yourself.

38:16.708 --> 38:17.812
You know why we're here.

38:17.812 --> 38:21.126
It's not just
a friendly visit, then?

38:21.126 --> 38:22.990
I'm assuming that you know
that Dellrayne is out.

38:22.990 --> 38:24.509
I may have heard.

38:24.509 --> 38:26.131
What does he want?
What's he after?

38:26.131 --> 38:27.201
Are you serious?

38:27.201 --> 38:28.513
Does it look like I'm kidding?

38:29.652 --> 38:31.170
- Domino.
- What's Domino?

38:32.344 --> 38:34.139
- A myth.
- Yeah. See, that's the thing.

38:34.139 --> 38:35.451
You kind of left too soon.

38:35.451 --> 38:37.384
- You said it was destroyed.
- Want to fill me in here?

38:37.384 --> 38:42.009
Project Domino,
Division's Holy Grail.

38:42.009 --> 38:44.080
It was a tool made in our lab--

38:44.080 --> 38:45.392
one that could control

38:45.392 --> 38:47.704
even the most powerful hypnotics.

38:47.704 --> 38:48.671
- Even Dellrayne?
- Yeah.

38:48.671 --> 38:49.810
Yeah. Yeah.

38:49.810 --> 38:51.087
Especially Dellrayne.

38:51.087 --> 38:52.985
That's why he stole it from us.

38:52.985 --> 38:55.816
Then he reset his own mind
to hide the trail.

38:55.816 --> 38:56.817
When we finally caught him,

38:56.817 --> 38:58.405
he had no memory of who he was,

38:58.405 --> 38:59.992
what he'd done with Domino, nothing.

38:59.992 --> 39:02.063
He erased his own mind?

39:02.063 --> 39:04.065
About six weeks ago,
it started to flood back.

39:05.239 --> 39:06.827
He broke out of our facility.

39:06.827 --> 39:10.934
He kind of, you know,
did the--fooled the guards.

39:10.934 --> 39:12.419
He must have planted triggers.

39:13.558 --> 39:16.077
It's clues the hypnotics
leave behind,

39:16.077 --> 39:18.286
like signposts
for their own subconscious.

39:18.286 --> 39:21.393
It can be words,
images, details.

39:21.393 --> 39:24.845
Puzzle pieces
that they use and scatter,

39:24.845 --> 39:26.191
in case their minds get reset.

39:26.191 --> 39:27.434
You know,
put the jigsaw back together.

39:27.434 --> 39:28.504
Remember who they are.

39:28.504 --> 39:30.126
The safe-deposit boxes.

39:30.126 --> 39:31.438
He's following the breadcrumbs.

39:31.438 --> 39:32.784
Yes.

39:32.784 --> 39:34.441
He must have planted
a whole stream

39:34.441 --> 39:35.442
before we caught him.

39:35.442 --> 39:36.926
The first few?

39:36.926 --> 39:39.515
That just restored
a portion of his power.

39:39.515 --> 39:42.414
Each one,
he's going to get stronger.

39:42.414 --> 39:43.415
He gets the last one,

39:43.415 --> 39:44.830
there's no stopping him.

39:46.522 --> 39:47.592
Where did you get that?

39:47.592 --> 39:49.041
The bank in Austin.

39:49.041 --> 39:51.078
It was in the safe-deposit box
he was after.

39:51.078 --> 39:52.528
It's a picture of my daughter.

39:52.528 --> 39:55.945
Well, she may play
a role in all this.

39:55.945 --> 39:56.911
It could be another trigger.

39:56.911 --> 39:58.016
Here. Let me see.

40:06.956 --> 40:08.129
What did you do to him?

40:10.338 --> 40:11.305
Who? This guy?

40:15.413 --> 40:16.517
Why are you backing up?

40:25.457 --> 40:26.424
Run.

40:47.617 --> 40:48.860
Get back!

41:30.557 --> 41:31.627
We're trapped!

41:31.627 --> 41:33.663
What you see isn't real.

42:26.198 --> 42:27.579
If you got any powers
you're holding out on,

42:27.579 --> 42:28.511
now's the time.

42:31.376 --> 42:32.342
All out.

42:40.212 --> 42:41.144
Rourke?

42:45.148 --> 42:46.529
Rourke?

42:58.645 --> 42:59.577
I'm not doing this.

43:03.822 --> 43:05.168
No.

43:05.168 --> 43:06.480
I am.

43:28.260 --> 43:29.365
It just doesn't make sense.

43:29.365 --> 43:30.918
I mean, what?

43:30.918 --> 43:32.920
Do I have powers
all of a sudden?

43:32.920 --> 43:34.681
I mean, how did I do that?

43:34.681 --> 43:36.544
I don't know.

43:36.544 --> 43:37.615
You saw it.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.306
You were right there.

43:39.306 --> 43:41.032
You know, one second,
he was coming right at me.

43:41.032 --> 43:42.309
The next minute,

43:42.309 --> 43:44.518
it was literally as if
I was inside their minds.

43:44.518 --> 43:45.864
Welcome to the club.

43:45.864 --> 43:47.797
That's not possible.

43:47.797 --> 43:49.281
I've never done anything
like this before.

43:49.281 --> 43:50.351
I wouldn't know how.

43:50.351 --> 43:51.905
Or you just can't remember.

43:53.492 --> 43:54.804
- I--
- What you just did?

43:54.804 --> 43:56.185
Power like this,

43:56.185 --> 43:58.532
it takes more
than natural ability, okay?

43:58.532 --> 44:00.568
And I have no idea
how you did it.

44:02.674 --> 44:04.124
All right.
I have to know everything.

44:04.124 --> 44:06.229
Why me?

44:06.229 --> 44:07.990
Why my daughter?

44:07.990 --> 44:10.026
Dellrayne, Domino, this.

44:12.822 --> 44:14.237
Will you help me, please?

44:19.795 --> 44:20.934
Yes.

44:26.318 --> 44:29.080
River is the guy
who built their network.

44:29.080 --> 44:30.391
If there's anyone

44:30.391 --> 44:33.325
who can hack into
their database,

44:33.325 --> 44:34.879
it's him.

44:34.879 --> 44:36.950
He helped me disappear
when I left Division.

44:39.262 --> 44:41.230
But fair warning...

44:42.818 --> 44:44.854
...he can be eccentric.

44:44.854 --> 44:47.477
Oh!
And you're the normal one.

44:49.997 --> 44:51.274
He's a friend.

44:51.274 --> 44:52.344
Uh-huh, yeah.

44:52.344 --> 44:54.105
Good illusions anyways.

44:54.105 --> 44:55.347
No illusion.

44:55.347 --> 44:57.039
We're real.

44:57.039 --> 44:58.247
We need your help.

45:00.525 --> 45:01.526
With Dellrayne.

45:01.526 --> 45:03.252
I-I can't help you.

45:03.252 --> 45:05.219
If he knows we're here,

45:05.219 --> 45:07.256
he'll torture
and reset you anyway.

45:19.578 --> 45:20.718
You're cold, Cruz.

45:21.926 --> 45:23.168
At least offer us a drink.

45:25.032 --> 45:26.240
I was going to.

45:27.276 --> 45:28.622
Anyways.

45:32.212 --> 45:33.731
I think.

45:42.429 --> 45:43.671
What happened to your eye?

45:43.671 --> 45:47.745
Asymmetrical shapes
help fool facial recognition.

45:50.333 --> 45:53.129
Camera drones and satellites
everywhere these days.

45:53.129 --> 45:54.682
Not to mention the Division.

45:58.790 --> 45:59.687
Are you inside
my mind right now?

45:59.687 --> 46:00.930
No.

46:00.930 --> 46:03.830
We're both friends.

46:03.830 --> 46:05.659
Amigos.

46:05.659 --> 46:06.936
Okay.

46:08.317 --> 46:11.458
Listen, uh, don't--
don't judge.

46:11.458 --> 46:13.218
I wasn't expecting visitors.

46:16.808 --> 46:18.120
This way.

46:30.373 --> 46:31.789
Watch your step.

46:34.446 --> 46:35.931
You know,
you could have called, Diana.

46:35.931 --> 46:37.725
Sent a text,

46:37.725 --> 46:39.486
you know, one of those
little Morse code thingies.

46:39.486 --> 46:40.590
I do have radio, you know.

46:42.282 --> 46:43.559
Showing up unannounced
is just rude.

46:43.559 --> 46:44.836
Ah.

46:44.836 --> 46:47.080
Homemade Mountain Dew.

46:48.184 --> 46:49.185
My own brew.

46:49.185 --> 46:50.221
All organic.

46:50.221 --> 46:51.981
Uh, no thanks.

46:51.981 --> 46:52.982
All right. Huh?

46:54.535 --> 46:55.433
All right, fine.
More for me.

46:59.161 --> 47:01.301
Mm. Check it out.

47:01.301 --> 47:02.198
Pretty impressive, huh?

47:04.649 --> 47:05.857
Hypnotics did all this?

47:05.857 --> 47:06.824
Uh-huh.

47:06.824 --> 47:08.204
It's a worldwide play, brother.

47:08.204 --> 47:10.862
Controlling major news,
events, organizations.

47:10.862 --> 47:12.553
Why the hell
are you here, Diana?

47:13.692 --> 47:15.902
Dellrayne is back.

47:15.902 --> 47:18.594
It has something to do
with Rourke's missing daughter.

47:18.594 --> 47:20.423
Dellrayne sent an army for us.

47:21.493 --> 47:23.564
Rourke, he took control.

47:25.773 --> 47:26.947
He overpowered him.

47:34.852 --> 47:35.922
Huh.

47:35.922 --> 47:37.716
More than meets the eye, huh?

47:39.028 --> 47:40.547
Apparently.

47:40.547 --> 47:41.479
But to what degree?

47:43.343 --> 47:44.275
Let's find out.

47:47.761 --> 47:49.176
All right, now listen,
I've got to tell you,

47:49.176 --> 47:51.454
hacking into a database this big
ain't easy-breezy, all right?

48:01.602 --> 48:05.123
All right, Austin PD database
has you employed 12 years.

48:05.123 --> 48:06.055
That's right.

48:07.781 --> 48:09.576
All right. I got a hit
for the Marine Corps.

48:09.576 --> 48:12.406
Distinguished Service medal,
honorable discharge.

48:12.406 --> 48:13.649
Said you had a family.

48:14.961 --> 48:16.100
Uh, let's see.

48:17.446 --> 48:19.448
Archives show no record
of a Daniel Rourke's spouse.

48:20.932 --> 48:22.071
Can't be.

48:22.071 --> 48:23.831
What was your wife's
maiden name?

48:23.831 --> 48:25.972
Riley. Vivian Riley.

48:25.972 --> 48:26.765
Vivian Riley.

48:30.666 --> 48:31.632
That's her.

48:33.048 --> 48:34.014
Whoa.

48:36.085 --> 48:38.260
"Vivian Riley...

48:38.260 --> 48:39.192
Division agent."

48:45.923 --> 48:48.063
That's impossible.

48:48.063 --> 48:49.029
"Current location encrypted."

48:50.513 --> 48:51.445
Can you hack it?

48:54.621 --> 48:56.312
I'll run something.

48:56.312 --> 48:57.451
It'll take a few hours.

48:57.451 --> 48:58.901
That's not right.

49:00.523 --> 49:02.180
We were together since college.

49:03.975 --> 49:07.530
I came home, had Minnie,
a family.

49:08.635 --> 49:09.877
This is my life.

49:10.982 --> 49:11.914
I'm sorry.

49:29.967 --> 49:31.313
You look like you need a drink.

49:33.522 --> 49:34.799
Moonshine.

49:34.799 --> 49:36.283
Thanks.

49:36.283 --> 49:37.698
Burns a little,

49:37.698 --> 49:42.013
but at least
it will help you forget.

49:49.572 --> 49:50.573
When we lost Minnie...

49:51.989 --> 49:53.024
...we lost everything.

49:55.302 --> 49:56.303
We lost ourselves.

49:56.303 --> 49:57.580
<i>The body</i>

49:57.580 --> 49:59.134
<i>of police Detective
Daniel Rourke's</i>

49:59.134 --> 50:00.411
<i>missing daughter,
Minnie Rourke,</i>

50:00.411 --> 50:01.515
<i>has still not been recovered.</i>

50:01.515 --> 50:03.517
And I can't keep going!

50:04.725 --> 50:05.761
<i>Nothing we had survived.</i>

50:05.761 --> 50:07.245
I can't.

50:10.041 --> 50:11.249
<i>Maybe Viv lied
about who she was.</i>

50:14.252 --> 50:16.703
But the pain was real.

50:20.431 --> 50:22.605
Sometimes,
it's all I had to hold on to.

51:08.617 --> 51:11.102
Whatever you're selling,
I'm not interested.

51:11.102 --> 51:12.345
<i>You're never
going to find your daughter.</i>

51:13.760 --> 51:14.761
How about I kill you?

51:21.423 --> 51:22.424
<i>You think you're strong?</i>

51:22.424 --> 51:23.701
<i>More powerful than me?</i>

51:24.978 --> 51:26.083
<i>I have other ways
of getting to you.</i>

51:27.498 --> 51:29.327
<i>Diana betrayed me,</i>

51:29.327 --> 51:32.468
<i>and now you're going
to kill her.</i>

51:32.468 --> 51:33.883
<i>Put that gun in your hand.</i>

51:42.271 --> 51:43.514
<i>Put three bullets in her head.</i>

51:45.930 --> 51:46.896
No.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.321
Diana.

52:02.153 --> 52:03.396
- Just a minute.
- Diana.

52:11.714 --> 52:12.750
Di--

52:15.166 --> 52:16.167
I'm coming.

52:23.726 --> 52:24.934
I had to borrow
one of River's shirts.

52:28.973 --> 52:29.905
What happened?

52:33.840 --> 52:36.222
He got to you, didn't he?

52:43.988 --> 52:45.058
I can see it.

52:46.197 --> 52:47.440
I heard a phone ring.
Did you answer it?

52:49.166 --> 52:50.201
Yes.

52:50.201 --> 52:51.375
Did he speak?

52:52.514 --> 52:53.584
What did he tell you?

52:55.310 --> 52:56.449
I... I don't...

53:03.387 --> 53:04.733
What is it that you see?

53:07.011 --> 53:07.874
I don't know.

53:17.918 --> 53:18.816
Where's your phone?

53:44.704 --> 53:46.084
I know things feel off.

54:01.238 --> 54:02.446
I know she hurt you.

54:06.726 --> 54:07.761
Do we have trust?

57:28.962 --> 57:31.206
Project Domino was never a what.

57:31.206 --> 57:32.656
No.

57:34.140 --> 57:35.244
It was a who.

57:38.213 --> 57:40.284
Where is she?

57:40.284 --> 57:42.769
Is she even alive?
Where did you take her?

57:42.769 --> 57:43.667
I didn't take her.

57:45.496 --> 57:46.911
You did.

57:51.019 --> 57:52.503
She's going
to have opportunities.

57:52.503 --> 57:53.642
On the one hand,

57:53.642 --> 57:55.610
you think,
well, I really am the person

57:55.610 --> 57:57.128
that should make
these decisions,

57:57.128 --> 57:59.130
but on the other hand,
you're better off away from her.

57:59.130 --> 58:00.166
I'm her mother.

58:00.166 --> 58:01.029
Yeah, well, I'm her father.

58:02.548 --> 58:04.273
They wanted to take her.

58:05.516 --> 58:06.966
The Division only wanted
to train her

58:06.966 --> 58:08.726
like they trained us--

58:08.726 --> 58:10.694
to be what she was born to be--

58:10.694 --> 58:13.006
the most powerful hypnotic
in the world.

58:14.076 --> 58:15.388
She was just a child.

58:32.819 --> 58:33.786
Minnie?

58:37.997 --> 58:39.654
You kidnapped our daughter.

58:39.654 --> 58:42.898
I protected her from you.

58:47.040 --> 58:48.421
I protected her from all of you.

58:51.528 --> 58:52.425
Where are we now?

58:54.289 --> 58:55.393
Are we really even here?

58:57.534 --> 58:58.500
Can't you see it yet?

59:04.402 --> 59:05.438
Look closer.

59:40.611 --> 59:42.095
You're in on this, too, Nicks?

59:43.890 --> 59:44.926
Or whatever your name is?

59:46.755 --> 59:48.032
You brought this on yourself.

59:49.965 --> 59:51.622
By the time we found you,
Domino was gone...

59:54.073 --> 59:56.178
...and you reset yourself.

59:56.178 --> 59:58.180
Wiped clean.

59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.182
No memory
of where you hid her...

01:00:00.182 --> 01:00:01.218
for four years.

01:00:02.426 --> 01:00:03.427
You've been an obstacle to me

01:00:03.427 --> 01:00:05.360
for too long, Rourke.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.362
This was dropped off
at Division headquarters...

01:00:08.777 --> 01:00:10.365
...six weeks ago.

01:00:10.365 --> 01:00:11.642
A clue or a taunt.

01:00:11.642 --> 01:00:12.988
You know what it means.

01:00:14.645 --> 01:00:16.371
Buried underneath
that psychic block.

01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:20.617
That's why we developed
this construct.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.998
The cop searching for the man
who took his missing daughter.

01:00:22.998 --> 01:00:24.655
Using my own brain against me.

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:26.968
To get you to remember
where you hid her.

01:00:28.279 --> 01:00:29.764
Like it or not,

01:00:29.764 --> 01:00:31.697
your daughter is going to reach
her full potential with me.

01:00:33.699 --> 01:00:35.390
Who is Lev Dellrayne?

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:12.763
This is where it always ends.

01:02:14.213 --> 01:02:16.456
We can't brute-force
a mind like yours, Dan.

01:02:18.286 --> 01:02:19.805
This was our 12th run
of the scenario.

01:02:21.116 --> 01:02:24.602
But every time we get too close,
you see the gaps,

01:02:24.602 --> 01:02:25.742
and the construct breaks.

01:02:28.952 --> 01:02:30.263
Just help us find her.

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:36.753
You had 12 runs at this...

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:37.995
and you haven't found her?

01:02:40.618 --> 01:02:43.380
Well, get ready for number 13.

01:02:46.176 --> 01:02:47.556
Because I'll never
tell you where she is.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:53.735
Take him in.

01:03:08.336 --> 01:03:09.647
Your mind
can't take much more...

01:03:13.306 --> 01:03:15.861
...of this...

01:03:15.861 --> 01:03:17.138
resets.

01:03:19.036 --> 01:03:20.210
At some point,

01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:22.177
the synapses
start breaking down,

01:03:22.177 --> 01:03:26.112
and it's too late
to get back what you were,

01:03:26.112 --> 01:03:27.976
what we had.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.083
Was any of it real?

01:03:35.156 --> 01:03:36.364
I love you.

01:03:37.952 --> 01:03:39.781
Don't ask me why.

01:03:43.336 --> 01:03:44.406
You remember, don't you?

01:03:45.649 --> 01:03:47.099
The good times.

01:03:48.686 --> 01:03:49.998
We did have a few.

01:03:51.068 --> 01:03:52.380
I remember everything.

01:03:57.143 --> 01:03:58.835
I know we wanted
different things for her.

01:04:00.422 --> 01:04:03.529
I know you want her to be free
to make her own decisions.

01:04:07.084 --> 01:04:09.259
She's too powerful
to be out there alone.

01:04:10.674 --> 01:04:12.020
She needs her mom and dad.

01:04:13.573 --> 01:04:14.747
We can be with her again.

01:04:17.439 --> 01:04:18.716
Together, Danny.

01:04:20.718 --> 01:04:22.237
Just tell me where she is.

01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:30.280
Go to hell.

01:04:54.235 --> 01:04:55.512
Initiate the reset.

01:05:22.746 --> 01:05:23.643
Where's your wife?

01:05:27.613 --> 01:05:28.648
I don't know.

01:05:29.822 --> 01:05:30.823
Where is your daughter?

01:05:32.998 --> 01:05:33.964
I don't know.

01:05:35.828 --> 01:05:37.002
Have you ever been in love?

01:05:39.694 --> 01:05:41.247
I don't know.

01:05:41.247 --> 01:05:42.939
Subject is clear.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.181
Prepare sequence.

01:05:44.181 --> 01:05:45.700
Okay.

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.116
One kidnapping
coming right up.

01:05:48.116 --> 01:05:50.463
All right, people,
let's go to reset.

01:05:50.463 --> 01:05:52.120
Places, everybody.

01:06:01.819 --> 01:06:03.511
Okay, here we go.

01:06:26.396 --> 01:06:27.362
Rourke?

01:06:32.816 --> 01:06:33.955
Rourke.

01:06:35.474 --> 01:06:36.716
Rourke?

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.029
Come back to us.

01:06:44.586 --> 01:06:47.520
Sorry. Must have drifted off
for a second.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.521
It's okay.

01:06:48.521 --> 01:06:49.591
It's your time.

01:06:51.904 --> 01:06:52.767
Where was I?

01:06:52.767 --> 01:06:54.251
The park?

01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:57.496
Your daughter.

01:06:57.496 --> 01:06:59.394
Right.

01:06:59.394 --> 01:07:00.913
The park.

01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:03.640
Her hair.

01:07:05.883 --> 01:07:07.126
I remember her hair.

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.064
Heart rate is normal.

01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:15.617
He's deep in the construct now.

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:54.208
<i>Alleged kidnapper
18-year old Lyle Terry</i>

01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:57.245
<i>has pled not guilty
due to mental incapacity,</i>

01:07:57.245 --> 01:08:00.386
<i>his lawyers insisting
he has no memory whatsoever...</i>

01:08:04.666 --> 01:08:06.082
He's noting where
his wedding band used to be.

01:08:07.842 --> 01:08:08.946
That's my cue.

01:08:25.756 --> 01:08:26.861
You lose something, compadre?

01:08:26.861 --> 01:08:27.827
Cockroach.

01:08:28.932 --> 01:08:30.140
Yeah, it's a hot day.

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.107
The damn things are everywhere.

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:35.801
Hey.

01:08:35.801 --> 01:08:37.630
Did you wipe your shoes?

01:08:41.703 --> 01:08:43.153
Call came into dispatch.

01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:44.327
Blocked number.

01:08:45.983 --> 01:08:47.709
<i>I'm calling to report a robbery.</i>

01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:49.470
<i>Is this crime
currently in progress?</i>

01:08:50.816 --> 01:08:52.197
<i>Today, the Bank of Austin.</i>

01:08:52.197 --> 01:08:53.612
<i>There's a safe-deposit box.</i>

01:08:53.612 --> 01:08:55.303
<i>Box 23.</i>

01:09:01.654 --> 01:09:03.069
We're here.

01:09:17.325 --> 01:09:18.430
Welcome to the show, boys.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.028
See that guy on the bench?

01:09:34.031 --> 01:09:34.963
He looks familiar.

01:09:38.104 --> 01:09:39.036
Something wrong, bud?

01:09:43.903 --> 01:09:46.389
<i>It's a sunny day.</i>

01:09:46.389 --> 01:09:47.286
The guards are in on it.

01:09:48.874 --> 01:09:49.806
Rourke.
Rourke, wait!

01:09:57.607 --> 01:09:58.815
Get ready for the bank robbery.

01:10:25.635 --> 01:10:26.739
Where's Rourke?

01:10:29.363 --> 01:10:30.467
Where's Rourke?

01:10:30.467 --> 01:10:32.228
River?

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:33.298
Where is he?

01:10:33.298 --> 01:10:34.230
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't have eyes.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.265
Stand by.

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:36.715
Anybody got eyes on Rourke?

01:10:41.823 --> 01:10:43.584
All hands on deck.

01:10:43.584 --> 01:10:44.826
Subject has broken through.

01:11:02.672 --> 01:11:04.708
Stop.

01:11:06.779 --> 01:11:08.022
Turn off the engine.

01:11:09.334 --> 01:11:10.680
And step out.

01:11:12.992 --> 01:11:15.201
Rourke...

01:11:15.201 --> 01:11:16.720
turn off the engine.

01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:23.244
And step out.

01:11:46.371 --> 01:11:48.890
Get the helicopter.
Send everyone.

01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:50.444
- Don't lose him.
- His notebook.

01:11:50.444 --> 01:11:52.031
He tore out a page,
but look what he wrote down.

01:11:52.031 --> 01:11:54.240
Deer Valley Lane.

01:11:56.346 --> 01:11:58.037
Lev Dellrayne is not a name.

01:11:58.037 --> 01:12:00.385
It's a trigger he left
to remember her location.

01:12:34.764 --> 01:12:35.696
Took you long enough.

01:12:39.389 --> 01:12:40.252
- You alone?
-  For now.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.219
They'll be here soon.

01:12:43.428 --> 01:12:44.705
Where is she?

01:12:50.262 --> 01:12:51.608
I've got something.

01:12:51.608 --> 01:12:53.299
It looks like Deer Valley Lane

01:12:53.299 --> 01:12:54.680
dead-ends into a cattle ranch

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.751
belonging to
a Carl and Thelma Everett.

01:12:56.751 --> 01:12:57.752
What's their link to Rourke?

01:12:57.752 --> 01:12:59.685
There's nothing in the file.

01:12:59.685 --> 01:13:01.894
He must have hid Minnie
with them all this time.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.383
It says here they had
a foster kid 40 years ago.

01:13:11.939 --> 01:13:12.905
It's Rourke.

01:13:16.633 --> 01:13:18.566
Before this goes down,
I need to know something.

01:13:18.566 --> 01:13:20.326
Why did you trust us with her?

01:13:22.294 --> 01:13:24.434
You taught me
everything I know, Carl,

01:13:24.434 --> 01:13:25.642
including how to keep

01:13:25.642 --> 01:13:26.988
a moral compass pointed
in the right direction.

01:13:28.093 --> 01:13:30.095
Is this going to work?

01:13:30.095 --> 01:13:30.992
If you're ready.

01:13:36.653 --> 01:13:37.999
You'd best get inside.

01:14:59.529 --> 01:15:00.703
Hi, Daddy.

01:15:02.359 --> 01:15:03.257
I set them up for you.

01:15:05.362 --> 01:15:06.432
I've missed you, baby.

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:24.692
She's here.

01:16:11.221 --> 01:16:13.879
Read the signs, jackass.

01:16:16.054 --> 01:16:19.713
Private goddamn property.

01:16:19.713 --> 01:16:20.748
Hold your fire.

01:16:23.233 --> 01:16:24.131
We missed you, sweetheart.

01:16:29.343 --> 01:16:30.551
I don't know you.

01:16:32.139 --> 01:16:33.865
We love you like our own, Diana.

01:16:35.349 --> 01:16:36.626
But we'll still put
a hole in you.

01:16:38.766 --> 01:16:40.941
You have my daughter

01:16:40.941 --> 01:16:42.839
and we're not leaving here
without her.

01:16:47.326 --> 01:16:48.845
Kill them.

01:16:50.364 --> 01:16:51.399
Carl!

01:16:54.264 --> 01:16:55.783
No! Get medical.

01:16:55.783 --> 01:16:56.819
We need medical!

01:16:57.958 --> 01:16:59.166
We're not here for them.

01:16:59.166 --> 01:17:00.167
Where is she?

01:17:01.375 --> 01:17:02.618
Where's Minnie?

01:17:06.552 --> 01:17:09.141
Whatever Rourke has told you,
it's a lie.

01:17:09.141 --> 01:17:11.488
She won't be safe until
she's back with us at Division.

01:17:11.488 --> 01:17:12.697
That's where she belongs.

01:17:14.319 --> 01:17:15.389
That's not you talking.

01:17:17.356 --> 01:17:18.564
That's the Division.

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.810
The Diana I know,

01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:25.123
the woman I love,

01:17:25.123 --> 01:17:26.711
wouldn't want this life
for our little girl.

01:17:28.471 --> 01:17:29.506
Think about that.

01:17:29.506 --> 01:17:30.576
There's no escaping us.

01:17:30.576 --> 01:17:31.923
You know that.

01:17:33.545 --> 01:17:35.340
You know the consequences.

01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:37.998
There's only two ways this ends.

01:17:37.998 --> 01:17:40.725
You and Minnie
come back to Division,

01:17:40.725 --> 01:17:43.451
or Minnie comes back
without you.

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:49.078
It's all right, sweetheart.
Come on out.

01:18:11.756 --> 01:18:13.205
You're so big.

01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:16.484
You're safe now.

01:18:17.554 --> 01:18:18.659
You're safe.

01:18:21.248 --> 01:18:23.699
You still wear braids.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.010
I make them myself now.

01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:26.494
Of course you do.

01:18:29.359 --> 01:18:30.464
I'm so proud of you, Mommy.

01:18:34.123 --> 01:18:35.296
Proud of me for what?

01:18:35.296 --> 01:18:36.573
For coming home.

01:18:43.373 --> 01:18:44.478
We're setting ourselves free.

01:18:46.756 --> 01:18:47.757
From them.

01:18:51.554 --> 01:18:52.658
No.

01:18:53.867 --> 01:18:54.799
When did she...

01:19:03.255 --> 01:19:04.636
This isn't real.

01:19:07.225 --> 01:19:08.605
We're not here!

01:19:14.266 --> 01:19:15.509
It's a construct!

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:17.925
It's her!

01:19:30.835 --> 01:19:32.008
Uh...

01:19:41.949 --> 01:19:43.813
You're doing this.

01:19:47.161 --> 01:19:48.335
I love you.

01:19:49.543 --> 01:19:50.647
I love you, too.

01:19:50.647 --> 01:19:52.477
I'm going to bring you back now.

01:19:56.101 --> 01:19:57.171
Close your eyes.

01:21:52.286 --> 01:21:53.253
Have you ever been in love?

01:21:53.253 --> 01:21:54.254
Where am I?

01:21:55.841 --> 01:21:56.912
Where am I?

01:22:04.574 --> 01:22:06.162
Have you ever been in love?

01:22:06.162 --> 01:22:07.129
Help!

01:22:08.751 --> 01:22:09.855
Where am I?

01:22:09.855 --> 01:22:10.995
Help!

01:22:26.182 --> 01:22:27.701
Help!

01:22:39.644 --> 01:22:40.921
Do you remember now, Mommy?

01:22:44.614 --> 01:22:45.857
When she was born,

01:22:45.857 --> 01:22:47.238
we prayed
she wouldn't be like us.

01:22:48.687 --> 01:22:49.585
That she would be normal.

01:22:51.794 --> 01:22:53.002
<i>But soon, we understood</i>

01:22:53.002 --> 01:22:55.315
<i>that the daughter
of two powerful hypnotics</i>

01:22:55.315 --> 01:22:56.661
<i>would have
an extraordinary gift.</i>

01:22:58.697 --> 01:23:00.044
<i>It would help the world explore</i>

01:23:00.044 --> 01:23:02.080
<i>the untapped abilities
of the human mind.</i>

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.742
<i>The Division realized</i>

01:23:08.742 --> 01:23:11.987
<i>that Minnie's power
could transform society--</i>

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:15.507
<i>not to unlock human potential,</i>

01:23:15.507 --> 01:23:19.373
<i>but to force people
to do what they were told...</i>

01:23:19.373 --> 01:23:20.719
<i>or else.</i>

01:23:24.723 --> 01:23:26.104
<i>They wanted
Minnie to be their weapon.</i>

01:23:29.935 --> 01:23:32.248
<i>We wanted our daughter
to be free,</i>

01:23:32.248 --> 01:23:34.147
<i>but we knew we could never
outrun the Division.</i>

01:23:34.147 --> 01:23:35.769
<i>They would never let us go.</i>

01:23:35.769 --> 01:23:38.496
<i>The only way
to escape any of them</i>

01:23:38.496 --> 01:23:40.877
<i>was to bring them all together,</i>

01:23:40.877 --> 01:23:42.672
<i>and destroy the Division completely.</i>

01:23:42.672 --> 01:23:44.088
Wake up, sweetie.

01:23:44.088 --> 01:23:45.779
<i>But we couldn't
take them on ourselves.</i>

01:23:50.577 --> 01:23:51.785
She wasn't ready yet.

01:23:53.235 --> 01:23:54.236
<i>That's why we had to wait.</i>

01:23:55.444 --> 01:23:56.962
<i>Three years,</i>

01:23:56.962 --> 01:23:57.929
<i>maybe more.</i>

01:23:59.379 --> 01:24:00.759
<i>Then she'd be strong enough.</i>

01:24:02.382 --> 01:24:03.590
<i>That's when she'd send
the trigger.</i>

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.869
<i>Tip the first domino,</i>

01:24:06.869 --> 01:24:08.560
<i>to lead them out here...</i>

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.837
<i>and kill them.</i>

01:24:11.425 --> 01:24:13.462
And we knew the only way

01:24:13.462 --> 01:24:15.464
to keep our plan
from the Division

01:24:15.464 --> 01:24:17.638
was to erase our own memories.

01:24:17.638 --> 01:24:19.226
Help!

01:24:19.226 --> 01:24:20.710
Where am I?

01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:22.264
Help!

01:24:24.542 --> 01:24:26.061
<i>We reset ourselves</i>

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:30.410
and believed
we loved each other so much,

01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:31.514
we would find each other again.

01:24:34.655 --> 01:24:35.760
Minnie and I,

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.451
we're your most stubborn memories,

01:24:37.451 --> 01:24:39.246
the hardest ones to erase.

01:24:39.246 --> 01:24:40.523
I didn't want to let you go.

01:24:42.732 --> 01:24:43.802
Now you never have to.

01:24:47.737 --> 01:24:48.876
What now?

01:24:51.569 --> 01:24:53.329
We finally get to decide that
for ourselves.

01:24:57.437 --> 01:24:58.610
We're free.

01:25:01.234 --> 01:25:02.856
We're finally free.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:35.949
Y'all go on ahead.

01:26:35.949 --> 01:26:38.054
I'll clean up here
and follow you.
