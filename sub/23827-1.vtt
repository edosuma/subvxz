04:40.605 --> 04:41.406
Hello.

06:13.564 --> 06:14.630
Here, keep the change.

06:14.632 --> 06:15.533
Thanks a lot, man.

06:50.834 --> 06:52.236
Mikki?

06:53.002 --> 06:54.204
Hi, Gale.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.240
Mikki.

06:58.242 --> 06:59.144
Hi, Dudu.

07:09.086 --> 07:09.920
It's our Mikki.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.859
So, when did you get in?

07:17.360 --> 07:20.197
Mikki, who taught you English?

07:20.598 --> 07:22.731
- No, no. Who taught you English?
- Yeah.

07:22.733 --> 07:25.033
Isn't that lady
taught you English.

07:25.035 --> 07:25.867
I'm sorry, Gale.

07:25.869 --> 07:27.202
Yeah, I remember.

07:27.204 --> 07:28.406
I just got in.

07:29.807 --> 07:31.072
I was trying to figure out.

07:31.074 --> 07:33.444
When was the last time
you were in this house?

07:33.944 --> 07:35.176
Wow.

07:35.178 --> 07:38.449
Um, I used to come
from eight to 12.

07:39.783 --> 07:42.519
Now, I'm 37, so, 25 years ago.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.588
Oh my god.

07:45.855 --> 07:47.688
Little scrappy kid you were.

07:47.690 --> 07:49.726
Always in trouble.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.194
Where are you going?

07:52.196 --> 07:54.866
You wanna eat, don't ya?

07:57.901 --> 08:02.204
Italian women are very
much like Moroccans, spicy.

08:03.740 --> 08:06.341
Mikki, I hope you
still love pasta.

08:06.343 --> 08:09.844
And the food, can't beat it.

08:09.846 --> 08:11.312
I love your pasta, Gale.

08:11.314 --> 08:12.313
Thank you.

08:12.315 --> 08:14.218
Get ready to dig in.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.288
Thank you.

08:21.291 --> 08:26.296
So, did you have a chance to
speak to your mom before...

08:27.130 --> 08:29.264
No.

08:29.266 --> 08:33.071
I didn't have access to a
phone right when it happened.

08:34.438 --> 08:37.640
She was always so
worried about you.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.147
So, what's your plan?

08:45.015 --> 08:47.148
I figured change of
place, change of luck.

08:49.052 --> 08:51.686
You remind me of
my sister, your mom.

08:51.688 --> 08:53.089
But let me tell you something.

08:53.091 --> 08:54.890
There's no such thing as luck.

08:54.892 --> 08:58.093
Trust me, I know
better than anybody.

08:58.095 --> 08:59.297
I'll figure something out.

09:00.631 --> 09:04.034
So, you have a
place to stay, Mikki?

09:06.102 --> 09:07.670
Not yet.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.770
I'll figure something out.

09:08.772 --> 09:10.573
Don't be silly.

09:10.575 --> 09:12.509
You're staying with us.

09:14.510 --> 09:16.645
Could I talk to you
for a second, Dudu?

09:16.647 --> 09:17.813
- Talk.
- No.

09:17.815 --> 09:19.984
In the kitchen.

09:27.423 --> 09:29.059
What's wrong with me?

09:30.360 --> 09:32.294
Why would you ask
him to stay here?

09:32.296 --> 09:33.594
He's not our responsibility.

09:33.596 --> 09:35.332
He is family.

09:36.866 --> 09:39.200
Okay, I understand
that, but why can't he stay...

11:16.432 --> 11:17.402
No, jet lag.

11:24.542 --> 11:25.843
Mikki.

11:26.809 --> 11:27.778
Mikki?

11:35.586 --> 11:37.084
Mikki.

11:37.086 --> 11:38.552
Mikki.

11:38.554 --> 11:40.254
Mikki.

11:41.491 --> 11:42.860
Ah.

12:21.532 --> 12:24.098
Dudu, you look great.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.800
You lost weight since
I last seen you?

12:25.802 --> 12:26.801
I saw you yesterday.

12:26.803 --> 12:27.636
I know.

12:27.638 --> 12:28.837
What's your secret?

12:28.839 --> 12:30.137
Who's this?

12:30.139 --> 12:31.973
You replacing me right now?

12:31.975 --> 12:34.276
My nephew, Mikki.

12:34.278 --> 12:34.876
Hey Arik.

12:34.878 --> 12:35.743
Hi.

12:35.745 --> 12:37.749
Nice to meet you.

12:43.254 --> 12:44.853
All right, next
stop, Disneyland.

12:44.855 --> 12:46.057
Yes, sir.

13:24.761 --> 13:27.863
These guys, man,
they've been here for years

13:27.865 --> 13:32.269
and they still look like
they're fresh off the boat.

13:39.275 --> 13:41.344
All right, time for work.

13:45.249 --> 13:46.046
Okay, Arik.

13:46.048 --> 13:46.815
Give Mikki a hand.

13:46.817 --> 13:48.019
Load these up.

13:57.528 --> 13:58.893
Mikki?

13:58.895 --> 14:00.564
Mikki fucking Levy.

14:10.274 --> 14:11.042
Mikki.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.542
Hey, Esther.

14:50.714 --> 14:52.347
What, are you guys
multiplying or something?

14:52.349 --> 14:53.281
Avi around?

14:53.283 --> 14:54.682
Yeah, I think so.

14:54.684 --> 14:57.651
How 'bout you check?

14:57.653 --> 15:00.088
How 'bout you ask nicely?

15:00.090 --> 15:00.791
Please.

15:10.033 --> 15:11.166
Yeah.

15:11.168 --> 15:12.733
Dudu's here.

15:12.735 --> 15:14.038
I'll be right out.

15:14.971 --> 15:16.305
I'm gonna be right back.

15:16.307 --> 15:17.074
Yeah.

15:18.008 --> 15:18.973
Usual?

15:18.975 --> 15:20.041
Please.

15:20.043 --> 15:21.278
Drinks?

15:23.013 --> 15:24.179
Make that two.

15:24.181 --> 15:25.016
Avi.

15:51.841 --> 15:52.773
That's my sister.

15:52.775 --> 15:53.910
She's um...

15:59.450 --> 16:00.415
What's up, babe?

16:00.417 --> 16:03.584
Mmm, honey.

16:03.586 --> 16:05.088
Honey.

16:05.922 --> 16:07.055
I'm at work.

16:07.057 --> 16:07.923
Jesus.

16:08.692 --> 16:09.858
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

16:09.860 --> 16:13.027
Okay, let's do that.

16:13.029 --> 16:14.230
There you go.

16:16.799 --> 16:18.635
Babe, one cube.

16:19.870 --> 16:20.937
Oh, sorry.

16:23.405 --> 16:24.305
That's my girl.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.248
Hi.

16:33.250 --> 16:35.083
Hey, Ahmed.

16:35.085 --> 16:36.917
I was, uh, hoping to run into
you.

16:36.919 --> 16:40.055
Don't give me that bullshit.

16:40.057 --> 16:41.455
How we doin' so far?

16:41.457 --> 16:43.959
Yeah, we great.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.129
Great like?

16:50.033 --> 16:51.134
Not enough.

16:52.201 --> 16:53.134
Not enough.

16:53.136 --> 16:54.636
I'm trying.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.969
Try harder.

16:55.971 --> 16:57.339
Push that shit.

16:57.341 --> 16:59.341
You should be in here
every day, dispensing.

16:59.609 --> 17:00.908
I know, but you know Avi.

17:00.910 --> 17:03.143
He doesn't like this
shit around here.

17:03.145 --> 17:04.813
I don't give a
shit what Avi likes.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.349
You know that?

17:08.251 --> 17:11.355
What the fuck are
you looking at?

17:13.789 --> 17:14.825
Yeah, you.

17:15.692 --> 17:17.327
Hey, relax, man.

17:19.296 --> 17:21.296
Arik, who the
fuck is this guy?

17:21.298 --> 17:22.730
Hey, he's just a friend.

17:22.732 --> 17:23.731
It's okay.

17:23.733 --> 17:25.199
Oh, he's just a friend.

17:25.201 --> 17:26.801
I don't like the way your
friend is fucking looking at me.

17:26.804 --> 17:29.004
What do you want?

17:29.006 --> 17:30.471
What the fuck's your problem?

17:30.473 --> 17:31.907
You.

17:31.909 --> 17:33.074
- Hey.
- Ahmed.

17:33.076 --> 17:34.345
Whoa whoa whoa.

19:26.390 --> 19:29.991
Avi, why do you keep making
us come down to this shithole?

19:29.993 --> 19:32.459
You trying to convert
us or something?

19:32.461 --> 19:33.795
I'm sorry about that, Dimitry.

19:33.797 --> 19:37.966
It's um, we just had a
little bit of a problem,

19:37.968 --> 19:39.267
but everything's fine now.

19:39.269 --> 19:40.567
Yeah.

19:40.569 --> 19:41.569
You guys wanna sit
down, have a drink...

19:41.571 --> 19:43.438
No, I'm not here for drinks.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.340
I'm here to collect
my father's money.

19:45.342 --> 19:46.641
Oh, oh yeah, no, of course.

19:46.643 --> 19:47.941
Yeah, no, I have it right here.

19:47.943 --> 19:50.880
Um, just give me a minute, okay?

19:55.751 --> 19:56.986
Ahmed.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.421
What the fuck is with this guy?

20:00.423 --> 20:01.389
I'm not sure.

20:01.391 --> 20:02.989
You want me to go find out?

20:02.991 --> 20:04.028
Sit down.

20:10.767 --> 20:12.065
Somebody was hungry

20:12.067 --> 20:13.034
Yep.

20:13.036 --> 20:14.969
That was absolutely delicious.

20:14.971 --> 20:16.103
Oh my god.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.042
Thank you.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.776
You ate so fast you gave me
agita just looking at you.

20:24.814 --> 20:26.180
What's agita?

20:26.182 --> 20:27.614
Tell him what agita is.

20:27.616 --> 20:29.484
Mmmhmm, stress.

20:30.686 --> 20:32.554
Well, I'm sorry,

20:32.556 --> 20:33.888
but that was delicious.

20:33.890 --> 20:35.355
I take it as a compliment.

20:35.357 --> 20:37.625
Haven't had food that
good in a long time.

20:37.627 --> 20:38.860
All right, let's...

20:38.862 --> 20:40.161
No, no, no.

20:40.163 --> 20:40.996
No, no, please please
please, I got it,

20:40.998 --> 20:42.863
I got it, I got it.

20:42.865 --> 20:43.831
Please, let me.

20:43.833 --> 20:44.902
The chef should never clean.

20:46.368 --> 20:47.538
Ah.

20:48.971 --> 20:49.871
Let me.

20:49.873 --> 20:50.908
Thank you.

21:00.017 --> 21:00.981
I told you.

21:00.983 --> 21:02.417
He's not so bad.

21:02.419 --> 21:04.922
And you were right, as usual.

21:10.460 --> 21:12.893
Avi, what the fuck
do you want from me?

21:12.895 --> 21:14.328
I work for 'em.

21:14.330 --> 21:15.896
I gotta do what they say.

21:15.898 --> 21:18.365
It's just that they're
squeezing us so fucking hard,

21:18.367 --> 21:20.200
we're gonna be out of business.

21:20.202 --> 21:21.202
Business.

21:21.204 --> 21:22.236
You know what fucking happens

21:22.238 --> 21:24.171
when you do business with them.

21:24.173 --> 21:26.306
It's the price you pay.

21:26.308 --> 21:30.947
I did hear your business in
the back's doing pretty well.

21:35.518 --> 21:37.054
Assalamu alaikum.

21:38.221 --> 21:41.154
Esther, the fuck out of here.

21:41.156 --> 21:42.324
Yeah, just gotta close up.

21:42.326 --> 21:43.690
Hurry the fuck up.

21:43.692 --> 21:45.561
We gotta go. Come
on, I'll be in the fucking car.

21:49.298 --> 21:51.567
Drink your drink. I
gotta wash the fucking glass.

21:54.805 --> 21:56.774
Esther, give me another one.

22:03.512 --> 22:05.148
Hey, thanks.

22:06.715 --> 22:07.715
Where you going, babe?

22:07.717 --> 22:08.651
I'm tired.

22:09.618 --> 22:12.420
Long day, early
morning tomorrow.

22:12.422 --> 22:14.421
Yeah, I fucking waited
for you to get off.

22:14.423 --> 22:15.690
You know that?

22:15.692 --> 22:17.557
I didn't know that.

22:17.559 --> 22:19.026
I thought you were working.

22:19.028 --> 22:20.961
Arik, get
the fuck outta here.

22:20.963 --> 22:22.662
- I'm tired.
- No.

22:22.664 --> 22:23.931
Wait,
what are you doing?

22:23.933 --> 22:24.998
What are you doing?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.267
Stop it.

22:26.269 --> 22:27.602
What the
fuck are you doing?

22:27.604 --> 22:29.036
What the
fuck? I'm getting out.

22:29.038 --> 22:30.438
Esther,
what the fuck is your problem?

22:30.440 --> 22:31.372
I want
to go home. That's my fault?

22:35.979 --> 22:38.282
Hey, are you okay?

23:03.472 --> 23:04.807
On the house.

23:14.450 --> 23:18.952
Look at you, you're drooling.

23:20.490 --> 23:21.689
Don't worry, it's okay.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.691
You're not the first.

23:23.693 --> 23:27.061
Yeah, she has that
effect on men.

23:27.063 --> 23:28.630
If you wanna ask her out.

23:28.632 --> 23:30.234
I don't know, be my guest.

23:44.713 --> 23:45.581
So,

23:47.951 --> 23:50.019
how are you adjusting?

23:50.886 --> 23:52.620
It's okay?

23:52.622 --> 23:54.221
You miss home?

23:54.223 --> 23:55.724
No.

23:55.726 --> 23:58.392
You like Brooklyn that much?

23:58.394 --> 24:01.062
It's better than where I was.

24:01.064 --> 24:02.529
How long?

24:02.531 --> 24:04.399
How long what?

24:04.401 --> 24:06.467
How long were
you locked up for?

24:08.304 --> 24:09.269
Oh, come on.

24:09.271 --> 24:11.538
I'm around ex-cons all day.

24:11.540 --> 24:13.076
It's obvious.

24:13.710 --> 24:14.709
Is it?

24:14.711 --> 24:16.009
It is.

24:16.011 --> 24:18.345
And I get the sense
you did some real time.

24:18.347 --> 24:19.348
Am I right?

24:25.221 --> 24:26.453
Why don't you get
me another beer?

24:26.455 --> 24:27.557
How 'bout that?

24:30.460 --> 24:32.696
Yeah, how 'bout that.

24:34.430 --> 24:35.899
Hey.

24:37.334 --> 24:39.536
What are you doing later?

24:44.106 --> 24:46.109
Uh, sleeping probably.

24:53.682 --> 24:55.682
Okay.

24:55.684 --> 24:56.787
That's it?

24:58.154 --> 24:59.921
That's how you ask a girl out?

24:59.923 --> 25:03.123
Who said I was asking you out?

25:03.125 --> 25:04.892
What's your deal?

25:04.894 --> 25:05.860
I don't have a deal.

25:05.862 --> 25:07.394
Everybody has a deal.

25:07.396 --> 25:10.064
What do you want out of life?

25:10.066 --> 25:13.601
Every day above ground's
a good day for me now.

25:13.603 --> 25:14.270
Wow.

25:15.837 --> 25:18.509
That's a sad way to see things.

25:19.776 --> 25:23.180
All depends on where
you're looking, right?

25:30.185 --> 25:30.987
Shit.

25:35.224 --> 25:36.056
Hey, guys.

25:36.058 --> 25:36.859
What can I get for you?

25:39.996 --> 25:41.662
Where's Avi?

25:41.664 --> 25:44.000
Uh, I'll, just a second.

25:48.805 --> 25:50.504
Yeah, it's nice.

25:50.506 --> 25:52.439
I think you need
to come down here.

25:54.243 --> 25:55.910
He'll be right down.

25:55.912 --> 25:58.248
Can I get you something?

26:01.284 --> 26:02.350
What's a nice girl like you

26:02.352 --> 26:05.088
doing in a shithole like this?

26:06.288 --> 26:08.491
Oh, I like this shithole.

26:09.625 --> 26:12.494
Why, you got a better idea?

26:12.496 --> 26:14.865
I could think of something.

26:19.201 --> 26:21.505
Avi will be right up, so...

26:39.321 --> 26:41.655
Gentlemen, to what
do I owe this honor?

26:44.193 --> 26:45.660
Why why why?

26:45.662 --> 26:49.930
Avi, how many times do
we have to come down here?

26:49.932 --> 26:51.432
This is ridiculous.

26:51.434 --> 26:52.400
We can't do business this way.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.467
You gotta give us more time.

26:53.469 --> 26:54.635
Fuckin' time.

26:54.637 --> 26:55.670
- I fucking...
- Wait wait, no no.

26:57.339 --> 26:58.538
Jesus.

26:58.540 --> 27:00.307
You need more
fucking time, huh?

27:09.818 --> 27:11.352
Everybody out the back.

27:11.354 --> 27:12.386
Come on, out this way.

27:12.388 --> 27:13.421
Drinks are on us, guys.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.223
Out.

27:19.296 --> 27:20.430
Dudu, Dudu.

28:27.430 --> 28:28.896
You two, out now.

28:28.898 --> 28:29.662
Yeah, but...

28:29.664 --> 28:30.466
Out.

28:59.528 --> 29:00.529
Avi.

29:35.064 --> 29:36.663
Ahmed.

29:36.665 --> 29:39.901
The fuck
are you doing here?

29:39.903 --> 29:42.105
I got a message for you.

29:43.605 --> 29:44.607
A message?

29:45.642 --> 29:46.340
From who?

29:46.342 --> 29:47.741
Avi.

29:47.743 --> 29:49.008
You're not welcome at
the fucking bar anymore.

29:49.010 --> 29:49.876
You understand?

29:49.878 --> 29:50.780
Fuck you.

29:51.748 --> 29:52.982
The fuck out.

29:54.549 --> 29:56.382
I could have you killed for
just fucking showing up here.

29:56.384 --> 29:58.186
You do whatever
the fuck you want.

29:58.188 --> 29:59.653
Avi says you can't
come to the bar,

29:59.655 --> 30:01.020
so you can't come
to the fucking bar.

30:01.022 --> 30:02.190
You understand me?

30:02.192 --> 30:02.890
You're a dead man.

30:02.892 --> 30:03.590
Oh, yeah?

30:03.592 --> 30:04.592
We'll see.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.427
You're fucking dead.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.066
Fuck off my porch.

31:02.151 --> 31:03.586
Have a cookie.

31:05.954 --> 31:07.087
Yeah, boss.

31:07.089 --> 31:09.291
Just don't say anything.

31:10.792 --> 31:12.258
What happened?

31:12.260 --> 31:13.395
I'm okay.

31:16.031 --> 31:18.332
What is that?

31:18.334 --> 31:19.466
It was an ambush.

31:19.468 --> 31:20.267
An ambush?

31:20.269 --> 31:21.235
Yeah.

31:21.237 --> 31:22.303
How many people?

31:22.305 --> 31:24.103
- Six.
- Five.

31:24.105 --> 31:25.171
Where?

31:25.173 --> 31:26.207
Avi's bar.

31:26.209 --> 31:28.042
Did Avi know these guys?

31:28.044 --> 31:29.776
We went to get the money.

31:29.778 --> 31:33.046
Avi didn't have the money.

31:33.048 --> 31:34.483
Things got out of control.

31:35.483 --> 31:38.117
What does that mean?

31:38.119 --> 31:39.553
Vlad hit him.

31:39.555 --> 31:41.889
What are you smacking people,
first of all, in public?

31:41.891 --> 31:42.989
That's something that
you should know better

31:42.991 --> 31:44.528
than to do, Vlad.

31:46.028 --> 31:47.827
You go back there and
you get the money.

31:47.829 --> 31:49.197
Gonna get the money.

31:49.199 --> 31:50.831
You should know better.

31:50.833 --> 31:51.798
I'm sorry.

31:51.800 --> 31:52.498
I'm gonna fix this.

31:52.500 --> 31:53.267
All right, go.

31:53.269 --> 31:54.471
Come on.

32:03.078 --> 32:05.813
The way you took
out those Russkies.

32:05.815 --> 32:07.614
I mean, that was insane.

32:07.616 --> 32:08.815
I thought you were gonna
kill them right there

32:08.817 --> 32:10.817
in front of everybody.

32:10.819 --> 32:12.987
I was just
protecting my family.

32:14.656 --> 32:15.590
You're nuts, bro.

32:15.592 --> 32:16.657
You know that?

32:16.659 --> 32:17.757
Fucking nuts.

32:22.064 --> 32:23.432
All right.

32:27.169 --> 32:29.437
What do you know about cocaine?

32:29.439 --> 32:30.540
Nothing.

32:31.840 --> 32:32.773
Why?

32:32.775 --> 32:33.941
Don't fucking lie to me.

32:33.943 --> 32:34.908
I seen your little
side business.

32:34.910 --> 32:36.978
What do you know about cocaine?

32:36.980 --> 32:39.145
It's just a little bit
here, a little bit there.

32:39.147 --> 32:40.349
That's all.

32:42.050 --> 32:43.450
How much can you move?

32:43.452 --> 32:44.418
Depends.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.886
It depends on what?

32:45.888 --> 32:49.523
It depends on, if it's
wholesale, if it's retail,

32:49.525 --> 32:51.424
the quantity, the quality.

32:51.426 --> 32:52.759
It depends.

32:52.761 --> 32:55.496
Where you gonna get
all that blow anyways?

32:55.498 --> 32:57.731
Don't worry about that?

32:57.733 --> 32:58.932
Why don't you ask Ahmed?

32:58.934 --> 33:00.401
Fuck Ahmed.

33:00.403 --> 33:01.934
I know you don't
like him, all right?

33:01.936 --> 33:04.071
I know he's an asshole,
but you gotta admit,

33:04.073 --> 33:05.605
the guy is connected.

33:05.607 --> 33:09.742
I mean, he knows the Italians,
the Russians, everybody.

33:09.744 --> 33:11.711
Ahmed's not coming
around anymore.

33:11.713 --> 33:13.713
- What do you mean?
- I had a talk with him.

33:13.715 --> 33:15.815
I told him he can't
come to the bar anymore.

33:15.817 --> 33:17.651
Yeah, and he's cool with that?

33:21.289 --> 33:23.492
Let's just say he
didn't have a choice.

33:28.631 --> 33:29.930
Look, it's risky.

33:29.932 --> 33:30.797
Risky?

33:30.799 --> 33:32.298
Yeah.

33:32.300 --> 33:33.267
Hey, hey.

33:33.269 --> 33:34.167
Get your hands off me.

33:34.169 --> 33:35.436
Where you going?

33:35.438 --> 33:37.004
I got a lot of fucking coke.

33:37.006 --> 33:39.843
I don't know what to do with it.

33:44.380 --> 33:46.412
Make a lot of money.

33:46.414 --> 33:48.784
Talkin' about serious money.

33:50.920 --> 33:51.988
Let's get outta here.

34:08.335 --> 34:09.139
Psst.

34:15.445 --> 34:18.210
- Hey.
- Where's your pussy nephew?

34:18.213 --> 34:19.844
I don't know where Mikki is.

34:19.847 --> 34:21.317
Wrong answer.

34:30.659 --> 34:32.561
Enough, enough, enough.

34:36.164 --> 34:40.737
Tell your friends, you're
only alive because I allow it.

34:42.005 --> 34:44.536
My papa says the dead
don't pay their debts,

34:44.539 --> 34:48.507
but I think death
sends a strong message.

34:48.510 --> 34:50.911
But you,

34:50.913 --> 34:54.050
I'm going to get you as
close to death as possible.

34:58.054 --> 34:58.954
Let's go.

35:13.969 --> 35:15.202
I'm gonna run into the house.

35:15.204 --> 35:17.338
You just wait for
me out here, okay?

35:17.340 --> 35:18.704
Yeah.

35:18.706 --> 35:20.706
Man, I'm cold.

35:20.708 --> 35:21.541
Dudu?

35:21.543 --> 35:22.711
Dudu, Dudu.

35:26.181 --> 35:28.280
Hey, call an ambulance,
hey, call an ambulance.

35:28.282 --> 35:30.085
Dudu, Dudu, Dudu.

35:31.353 --> 35:34.621
Hello, I need an
ambulance right now.

35:34.623 --> 35:35.889
Oh my god, Gale, Gale Gale.

35:35.891 --> 35:37.191
I found him like this.

35:37.193 --> 35:38.624
Is that Dudu?

35:38.626 --> 35:39.827
Yeah, I found him like this.
Guys, you gotta...

35:39.829 --> 35:41.929
- Dudu, Dudu, Dudu.
- No, no, no.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.565
- Okay, it's okay.
- Oh my god, Dudu.

35:44.567 --> 35:47.101
- What did you do to him?
- I don't know.

35:47.103 --> 35:49.001
You are full of shit.

35:49.003 --> 35:50.972
You're poison, Mikki.

35:50.974 --> 35:52.440
- You're poison.
- Hey, hey, hey.

35:52.442 --> 35:53.807
Get out of my house.

35:53.809 --> 35:55.876
Get out of my house, Mikki.

35:55.878 --> 35:57.180
Get out, Mikki.

35:58.813 --> 36:00.380
- It's okay.
- What did you do?

36:00.382 --> 36:02.983
- It's okay.
- What did you do?

36:02.985 --> 36:04.251
It's gonna be okay.

36:04.253 --> 36:05.284
I swear to god, Gale.

36:05.286 --> 36:06.153
I didn't do anything.

36:06.155 --> 36:07.420
I found him like this.

36:07.422 --> 36:09.055
I swear to god, Gale.

36:09.057 --> 36:09.856
Gale.

36:11.893 --> 36:13.793
Arik, come on.

36:13.795 --> 36:14.628
Come on.

36:14.630 --> 36:15.832
Arik, come on.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.467
Fuck.

36:30.646 --> 36:31.848
Hey.

36:33.449 --> 36:34.815
You okay?

36:34.817 --> 36:37.083
Do you mind if Mikki crashes?

36:37.085 --> 36:38.251
Arik, what's going on?

36:38.253 --> 36:39.820
You're scaring me.

36:39.822 --> 36:41.957
Dudu's hurt.

36:42.423 --> 36:43.490
What, how?

36:43.492 --> 36:44.458
We don't know.

36:44.460 --> 36:45.726
Yeah, we do.

36:45.728 --> 36:48.095
- No, we don't.
- Yes, we fucking do.

36:48.097 --> 36:49.630
It was the fucking
Russians, all right?

36:49.632 --> 36:51.599
They fucking did it.

36:51.601 --> 36:52.869
Jesus Christ.

36:56.639 --> 36:58.271
- It was all my fault.
- What?

36:58.273 --> 36:59.440
No, it's not.

36:59.442 --> 37:00.673
Yes, it is.

37:00.675 --> 37:01.807
Don't say that.

37:01.809 --> 37:02.675
I'm gonna get a drink.

37:02.677 --> 37:05.179
Do you want something?

37:05.181 --> 37:06.081
Yeah.

37:09.318 --> 37:12.521
All right, this
should do the trick.

37:18.092 --> 37:19.561
Here, drink that.

37:28.036 --> 37:29.168
I should go.

37:29.170 --> 37:30.438
Where you gonna go?

37:30.440 --> 37:33.673
There's nothing you
can do right now.

37:33.675 --> 37:36.078
Can I be honest with you?

37:37.480 --> 37:40.479
What happened to Dudu is
terrible, it really was,

37:40.481 --> 37:41.749
but he survived.

37:41.751 --> 37:43.617
If they wanted him
dead, he'd be dead.

37:43.619 --> 37:44.885
So?

37:44.887 --> 37:46.853
So, perhaps instead
of sitting here,

37:46.855 --> 37:49.121
feeling sorry for yourself,
you should have a plan.

37:49.123 --> 37:50.523
I do have a fucking plan.

37:50.525 --> 37:51.691
I'm gonna beat the
fuck out of them.

37:51.693 --> 37:52.793
Oh, that's what your plan is?

37:52.795 --> 37:54.327
You're gonna run over there

37:54.329 --> 37:57.530
and beat up every
Russian that you see?

37:57.532 --> 38:01.570
Mikki, someone needed to
stand up to those guys

38:02.771 --> 38:04.438
for a long time.

38:04.440 --> 38:05.940
You did it.

38:05.942 --> 38:08.342
Maybe it's the wake-up
call that we all needed

38:08.344 --> 38:12.813
to see that things need
to change around here.

38:12.815 --> 38:16.552
Look what happened
to Dudu because of it.

38:17.585 --> 38:18.687
To Dudu.

38:19.889 --> 38:23.590
To Dudu.

38:30.465 --> 38:31.764
Thank you.

38:31.766 --> 38:33.099
For what?

38:33.101 --> 38:36.070
For letting me stay here.

38:36.072 --> 38:39.240
You can stay here
as long as you need.

38:39.875 --> 38:42.108
I'm gonna go to sleep.

38:42.110 --> 38:43.610
I'll see you in the morning.

38:43.612 --> 38:45.048
All right.

39:21.217 --> 39:21.985
Coffee?

39:23.719 --> 39:24.619
Black?

39:29.759 --> 39:32.195
Did you not like the sofa bed?

39:34.762 --> 39:37.197
I'm just used to
sleeping on the floor.

39:37.199 --> 39:38.233
Gotcha.

39:39.635 --> 39:41.668
It's probably hard for
you to understand, right?

39:41.670 --> 39:42.538
No, no.

39:44.239 --> 39:45.237
I get it.

39:56.617 --> 39:57.684
Hey, hey, no, no, no.

39:57.686 --> 39:59.355
Don't smoke in here.

40:11.532 --> 40:13.201
So, what'd you do?

40:14.335 --> 40:15.237
Huh?

40:16.438 --> 40:19.474
What did you do
to get sent away?

40:24.612 --> 40:26.181
Killed someone.

40:28.516 --> 40:30.152
How old were you?

40:33.554 --> 40:34.589
17.

40:37.994 --> 40:39.262
Who was it?

40:45.601 --> 40:46.633
That's fine.

40:46.635 --> 40:47.467
You don't have to say anything.

40:47.469 --> 40:50.202
I'm sorry. I...

40:50.204 --> 40:51.340
It's okay.

40:53.242 --> 40:54.177
Some guy,

40:57.545 --> 41:00.282
back home in my neighborhood.

41:01.150 --> 41:03.219
Used to bother my dad,

41:07.123 --> 41:08.925
take all his money.

41:12.527 --> 41:13.962
One day I just shot him.

41:20.503 --> 41:23.206
I would've done
the same thing.

41:27.943 --> 41:30.543
I did 18 years in jail for it.

41:30.545 --> 41:32.882
I would've done the same.

41:35.451 --> 41:36.648
You sure I can't
smoke in here?

41:36.650 --> 41:38.086
Absolutely not.

43:11.313 --> 43:12.215
30.

43:15.317 --> 43:16.782
Hey, Mikki.

43:16.784 --> 43:20.186
I got these guys who wanna
pick up a lot of weight.

43:20.188 --> 43:21.621
Okay, set it up.

43:21.623 --> 43:23.456
Yeah, but, I was thinking
maybe I could handle

43:23.458 --> 43:24.893
this one on my own.

43:26.295 --> 43:27.827
Handle what?

43:27.829 --> 43:29.795
You set up the meeting,
I make the deal.

43:29.797 --> 43:30.764
Yeah, but come on, Mikki.

43:30.766 --> 43:32.032
Let me just handle this one.

43:32.034 --> 43:33.499
You wanna handle it?

43:33.501 --> 43:34.200
Yeah.

43:34.202 --> 43:35.671
Get the door.

43:37.938 --> 43:38.940
Yo.

43:47.449 --> 43:50.452
- Opa.
- One, two, three, four, five.

43:53.255 --> 43:55.021
Okay.

43:55.023 --> 43:56.421
Whoa, you weren't joking, huh?

43:56.423 --> 43:58.258
I never joke.

43:58.260 --> 43:59.295
Fuck.

44:03.597 --> 44:04.532
Out back.

44:07.568 --> 44:08.869
Bye.

44:08.871 --> 44:09.639
Okay.

44:11.273 --> 44:12.204
See you, man.

44:12.206 --> 44:12.974
- Bye.
- Bye.

44:15.476 --> 44:16.309
We done here?

44:16.311 --> 44:17.280
Yeah.

44:18.213 --> 44:20.282
All right, come here.

44:21.148 --> 44:22.548
I'm gonna give you
one fucking shot.

44:22.550 --> 44:25.184
Don't fuck this up.

44:25.186 --> 44:27.054
Take this. Put it in your bag.

44:27.056 --> 44:28.554
Thank you, Mikki.

44:28.556 --> 44:29.356
The minute you have the
cash, you bring it to me,

44:29.358 --> 44:30.423
to the house.

44:30.425 --> 44:31.624
- Yeah.
- Understand?

44:31.626 --> 44:32.724
I got it. I
won't let you down.

44:32.726 --> 44:34.059
All right, get outta here.

44:34.061 --> 44:35.362
Tell your sister
I'll call her later.

44:35.364 --> 44:36.563
Yeah.

44:36.565 --> 44:38.532
You excited
about the wedding?

44:39.568 --> 44:42.068
As excited as I can be.

44:42.070 --> 44:44.470
Good thing you're
getting married.

44:44.472 --> 44:46.340
You gotta have some kids
some time in your life.

44:46.342 --> 44:48.108
That's what my mother
keeps telling me.

44:48.110 --> 44:49.312
Yeah.

44:50.644 --> 44:52.112
Vlad, come.

44:52.114 --> 44:52.979
I'm gonna be over there.

44:52.981 --> 44:54.012
Yeah.

44:54.014 --> 44:55.715
What's up?

44:55.717 --> 44:57.153
You see that?

45:00.322 --> 45:01.090
Ahmed.

45:01.990 --> 45:03.557
He was a piece of shit anyway.

45:03.559 --> 45:05.325
Probably messing around
with some monkeys.

45:05.327 --> 45:06.659
I don't give a
shit about the man.

45:06.661 --> 45:07.894
I care about my goods.

45:07.896 --> 45:09.229
Someone's running around

45:09.231 --> 45:11.365
with a million dollars
worth of our goods.

45:11.367 --> 45:12.798
Now, we know the
police don't have it,

45:12.800 --> 45:14.700
'cause if they did, it
would've made the papers.

45:14.702 --> 45:16.168
Yeah.

45:16.170 --> 45:17.503
Somebody's got it and they're
gonna wanna get rid of it

45:17.505 --> 45:19.472
as fast as they can.

45:19.474 --> 45:22.508
I need you to find out
who could've taken it.

45:22.510 --> 45:23.642
I got it.

45:23.644 --> 45:25.211
So, trace back
to where he was,

45:25.213 --> 45:28.116
the people he knows
that you know.

45:29.483 --> 45:33.119
Find it where it is
before they get rid of it.

45:33.121 --> 45:34.987
Gonna do it right now, papa.

45:34.989 --> 45:36.322
Take care of it right now, yeah?

45:36.324 --> 45:37.525
I promise you.

45:51.206 --> 45:52.704
Hey, Mikki.

45:52.706 --> 45:54.042
We're all here.

45:55.342 --> 45:56.876
Hey, I see that.

45:56.878 --> 46:00.516
Yeah, I just wanted
to let you know that...

46:02.217 --> 46:05.221
All right, please,
coffee, black.

46:06.454 --> 46:08.287
- Yeah, but, I mean...
- Yeah, yeah.

46:08.289 --> 46:09.456
Come back.

46:09.458 --> 46:12.827
Get me a coffee,
please, Arik, no sugar.

47:08.550 --> 47:10.349
Mikki, here's your coffee.

47:10.351 --> 47:11.217
Thanks.

47:11.219 --> 47:12.452
Go back to the table.

47:12.454 --> 47:14.156
Be there in a second.

48:02.336 --> 48:03.170
Yeah, I know.

48:03.172 --> 48:05.106
I just, I don't get it.

48:06.108 --> 48:07.176
No, fuck him.

48:08.610 --> 48:12.077
You guys are so so much better.

48:12.079 --> 48:14.679
He's a fucking idiot.

48:15.684 --> 48:16.481
Yeah.

48:16.483 --> 48:17.751
I told you that.

48:17.753 --> 48:19.952
Hold on, I think
someone's at the door.

48:19.954 --> 48:20.820
All right, yeah.

48:20.822 --> 48:21.521
Let me call you back.

48:21.523 --> 48:22.691
Okay, okay.

48:24.358 --> 48:26.228
I'm coming, I'm coming.

48:32.501 --> 48:33.934
Hi, can I help you guys?

48:33.936 --> 48:35.767
Yeah, we're here
to see Mendel.

48:35.769 --> 48:37.037
Oh yeah, yeah, he's upstairs.

48:37.039 --> 48:38.003
Follow me.

48:59.561 --> 49:01.760
Babe, your friends are here.

49:01.762 --> 49:03.496
Yaki, hold on a second.

49:03.498 --> 49:04.430
Avi, shalom.

49:04.432 --> 49:05.565
Honey, take 'em over there

49:05.567 --> 49:06.733
and get 'em a drink.

49:06.735 --> 49:07.633
Do me a favor, okay?

49:07.635 --> 49:09.038
Get 'em a drink.

49:11.572 --> 49:13.505
What do you want to drink?

49:13.507 --> 49:14.340
I'll have some coffee.

49:14.342 --> 49:15.141
Coffee?

49:15.143 --> 49:15.911
Water.

49:17.311 --> 49:18.644
Yeah, yeah, Yaki,
hold on a second.

49:18.646 --> 49:19.579
Okay, baby.

49:19.581 --> 49:20.746
You're the best.

49:20.748 --> 49:21.650
I love you.

49:22.851 --> 49:24.217
All right, Yaki,
listen, I gotta go.

49:24.219 --> 49:25.016
I have company.

49:25.018 --> 49:25.818
I'm being rude.

49:25.820 --> 49:26.686
Yaki, I gotta go.

49:26.688 --> 49:27.720
Avi, shalom.

49:27.722 --> 49:28.921
No, no, no, sit down.

49:28.923 --> 49:30.389
Mendel, Mikkie,
Mikkie, Mendal.

49:32.226 --> 49:33.092
Guys, I'm sorry.

49:33.094 --> 49:34.260
Just a second, okay?

49:34.262 --> 49:35.262
Just a second.

49:35.264 --> 49:36.729
Moishe, I just talked to him.

49:36.731 --> 49:38.030
No W9, no money.

49:38.032 --> 49:39.432
Listen, I'm being
rude, I have company.

49:39.434 --> 49:42.367
I gotta go, I gotta go, okay?

49:42.369 --> 49:45.070
Guys, I'm sorry.

49:45.072 --> 49:46.505
You know how some people are.

49:46.507 --> 49:48.708
They're all about
business and money,

49:48.710 --> 49:50.175
business and money.

49:50.177 --> 49:51.779
It's a shame, huh?

49:52.880 --> 49:53.912
There she is.

49:53.914 --> 49:55.451
Hi, baby.

49:59.219 --> 50:00.052
You're the best.

50:00.054 --> 50:00.753
Thank you.

50:00.755 --> 50:02.722
Thank you.

50:02.724 --> 50:04.824
Avi, we need to talk.

50:04.826 --> 50:06.325
There's a lot of chatter
in the streets, Avi.

50:06.327 --> 50:08.528
I can not have that
kind of activity.

50:08.530 --> 50:10.229
And this whole thing with Ahmed,

50:10.231 --> 50:12.731
it's just bad for business.

50:12.733 --> 50:13.733
What thing?

50:13.735 --> 50:14.900
You don't know about Ahmed?

50:17.371 --> 50:20.240
Honey, Julie, bring
the paper, please.

50:20.242 --> 50:21.941
Thank you.

50:21.943 --> 50:23.311
Just a second.

50:27.815 --> 50:28.850
Thank you.

50:29.418 --> 50:30.849
Ahmed's dead.

50:30.851 --> 50:34.956
They found his body
floating in the East River.

50:38.626 --> 50:40.260
I don't know
anything about it.

50:40.262 --> 50:41.461
How did
you not have an idea?

50:41.463 --> 50:42.961
There's a war
about to break out.

50:42.963 --> 50:45.366
Which is why we're here.

50:46.434 --> 50:48.400
Why are we here?

50:48.402 --> 50:49.568
- Who is this?
- It's okay.

50:49.570 --> 50:50.769
You can speak freely.

50:50.771 --> 50:51.771
Oh, really, I
can speak freely?

50:51.773 --> 50:53.039
Thank you for the permission.

50:53.041 --> 50:55.675
But I will say this, for
two and a half years,

50:55.677 --> 50:58.610
two and a half years, I
have busted my ass, Avi.

50:58.612 --> 51:00.280
Where do you guys think
all this came from?

51:00.282 --> 51:01.313
It came from heaven?

51:01.315 --> 51:02.815
I did it like a mensch too.

51:02.817 --> 51:05.985
I paid my dues, my protection,
but the Russians, Avi,

51:05.987 --> 51:08.521
the Russians, they take and
they take and they take,

51:08.523 --> 51:09.921
and all I do is the work.

51:09.923 --> 51:10.824
Look, we...

51:10.826 --> 51:11.992
No, no, no, you look.

51:11.994 --> 51:12.958
You know what?

51:12.960 --> 51:14.827
Now they want close to 50%.

51:14.829 --> 51:16.429
It's just not fair, fellas.

51:16.431 --> 51:19.532
We know all too well, which
is why I brought Mikki here.

51:19.534 --> 51:20.400
Him?

51:20.402 --> 51:21.833
What are you gonna do?

51:21.835 --> 51:24.336
Tell him what you're gonna do?

51:24.338 --> 51:25.637
Very simple.

51:25.639 --> 51:26.639
I'll take care of
the Russians for you.

51:26.641 --> 51:28.074
Heh.

51:28.076 --> 51:29.541
This string bean?

51:29.543 --> 51:31.711
String bean, how
you gonna do that?

51:31.713 --> 51:33.880
You feed 'em falafel
and ask 'em nicely?

51:33.882 --> 51:35.081
Don't worry about
what I'm gonna do.

51:35.083 --> 51:36.416
First of all, wanna talk about
this

51:36.418 --> 51:37.416
fucking business you're doing.

51:37.418 --> 51:38.251
What is this, gas?

51:38.253 --> 51:39.485
How does he know?

51:39.487 --> 51:41.021
You talked to him
about my business?

51:41.023 --> 51:42.787
Let me tell you something,
string bean, okay?

51:42.789 --> 51:43.889
I'd like to have a threesome

51:43.891 --> 51:46.191
with my girl and her hot cousin,

51:46.193 --> 51:47.327
but neither one's gonna happen,

51:47.329 --> 51:48.628
so here we go.

51:48.630 --> 51:49.795
You guys handle your
part of the bargain

51:49.797 --> 51:51.865
and I'll handle mine.

51:51.867 --> 51:53.065
Oh, English in America.

51:53.067 --> 51:53.932
Yo, relax.

51:53.934 --> 51:55.969
Mikki, Mikki, Mikki.

51:55.971 --> 51:57.604
We're gonna handle
one thing at a time.

51:57.606 --> 51:59.204
First, we're gonna
handle the Russians,

51:59.206 --> 52:01.941
then we can talk
about business okay?

52:01.943 --> 52:02.876
All right?

52:02.878 --> 52:03.946
Okay, Mendel?

52:04.679 --> 52:06.179
You know what?

52:06.181 --> 52:07.046
You know, I'm not gonna get
handled in my own house.

52:07.048 --> 52:08.749
Honey, Jules.

52:08.751 --> 52:10.883
Where are you,
baby? Come, come, baby.

52:10.885 --> 52:11.851
It's okay.

52:11.853 --> 52:13.586
This is what I am gonna do.

52:13.588 --> 52:15.188
I'm gonna go in the jacuzzi

52:15.190 --> 52:16.856
and you know what
you two are gonna do?

52:16.858 --> 52:18.391
You're gonna see yourself out.

52:18.393 --> 52:19.293
Zay gezunt.

53:52.119 --> 53:53.253
Man, this dude
better hurry up, man.

53:53.255 --> 53:55.019
He think we got all day?

53:55.021 --> 53:55.954
Trippin', boy.

53:55.956 --> 53:58.023
Is that him right there?

53:58.025 --> 53:58.691
He looks so scared.

54:00.195 --> 54:01.663
Word.

54:04.364 --> 54:05.465
What's up?

54:05.467 --> 54:07.166
You tell me.

54:11.072 --> 54:12.871
Oh shit, white boy.

54:12.873 --> 54:14.706
It look like we gonna have
to take that sack from you.

54:15.543 --> 54:17.411
All right, whoa whoa.

54:18.980 --> 54:20.012
Chill, nigga.

54:20.014 --> 54:21.648
We just fucking with you, man.

54:21.650 --> 54:24.117
We ain't crazy enough to fuck
with your boy Mikki like that.

54:24.119 --> 54:25.184
That dude is crazy.

54:25.186 --> 54:26.088
Word up.

54:27.322 --> 54:30.992
Yeah, I knew you guys
were fucking with me.

54:33.094 --> 54:34.528
Man, get that.

54:36.498 --> 54:37.996
Tell your man,
Mikki, you saw us too.

54:37.998 --> 54:38.764
You heard?

54:38.766 --> 54:39.902
Pick that up.

54:40.902 --> 54:41.900
All right?

54:41.902 --> 54:43.603
Silly ass.

54:43.605 --> 54:45.237
Yo, you look like you
peed on yourself, man.

54:47.041 --> 54:48.141
All right.

54:48.143 --> 54:50.075
You guys have a goodnight.

54:53.547 --> 54:55.248
That was fucking delicious.

54:55.250 --> 54:56.050
Yeah?

54:56.885 --> 54:58.083
And the wine is amazing.

54:59.420 --> 55:00.956
I know my booze.

55:01.922 --> 55:03.021
Yes, you do.

55:04.592 --> 55:06.025
Give me your plate.

55:06.027 --> 55:07.626
Oh, well.

55:07.628 --> 55:09.295
Cook never cleans, right?

55:09.297 --> 55:10.298
Gentleman.

55:40.594 --> 55:41.996
Hello, Esther?

55:43.498 --> 55:44.365
Mikki?

56:03.117 --> 56:04.083
How did it go?

56:04.085 --> 56:04.816
Yeah, it's done.

56:04.818 --> 56:05.584
Yeah?

56:05.586 --> 56:06.452
Yeah.

56:06.454 --> 56:07.452
Everything's in here?

56:07.454 --> 56:08.454
Everything?

56:08.456 --> 56:10.023
Yeah.

56:11.259 --> 56:11.726
Okay, I'll see
you in the morning.

57:44.351 --> 57:45.420
Fuck!

57:56.496 --> 57:57.597
That's it.

57:57.599 --> 57:59.664
They killed Victor last night.

57:59.666 --> 58:00.666
Sure?

58:00.668 --> 58:01.266
What?

58:01.268 --> 58:02.103
Yeah.

58:05.773 --> 58:06.905
That's three.

58:09.911 --> 58:11.913
Dear, can I get a drink?

58:13.581 --> 58:15.280
Time to start thinking
differently about this,

58:15.282 --> 58:17.081
'cause something's wrong here.

58:17.083 --> 58:18.550
Something's wrong.

58:18.552 --> 58:19.784
We're being targeted.

58:23.123 --> 58:24.158
Thank you.

58:27.094 --> 58:27.760
Victor.

58:27.762 --> 58:28.693
Victor.

58:28.695 --> 58:29.394
To Victor.

58:29.396 --> 58:30.295
Victor.

58:30.297 --> 58:31.500
Victor.

58:33.735 --> 58:35.237
Go to the bar.

58:35.902 --> 58:37.101
Yeah?

58:37.103 --> 58:38.438
Get some answers.

58:38.440 --> 58:40.572
Why the bar?

58:40.574 --> 58:42.909
These guys always
know something.

58:42.911 --> 58:44.242
We're gonna take care of this.

58:44.244 --> 58:45.978
We're gonna make
this right, yeah?

58:45.980 --> 58:46.945
Yeah.

58:47.748 --> 58:48.481
Yeah?

58:48.483 --> 58:49.815
To Victor.

58:49.817 --> 58:50.581
- Yeah.
- To Victor.

58:50.583 --> 58:53.355
Victor.

58:59.994 --> 59:01.994
I swear to god, you should've
seen the look on his face.

59:01.996 --> 59:03.295
He almost shit his pants.

59:04.666 --> 59:06.898
Not exactly table
conversation, Avi.

59:06.900 --> 59:09.066
I think it's
perfect for the table.

59:09.068 --> 59:10.771
I'm sure you do.

59:11.605 --> 59:13.505
Esther, no wine?

59:13.507 --> 59:14.539
Oh, no.

59:14.541 --> 59:15.376
I'm okay.

59:16.510 --> 59:17.642
You okay, babe?

59:17.644 --> 59:19.177
Yeah.

59:19.179 --> 59:20.713
You sure?

59:20.715 --> 59:22.280
I need to use
the ladies' room.

59:22.282 --> 59:23.882
Esther, care to join me?

59:23.884 --> 59:24.885
Of course.

01:00:04.391 --> 01:00:07.293
Boys aren't
having fun without us?

01:00:07.295 --> 01:00:09.961
I'm not feeling so well.

01:00:09.963 --> 01:00:10.996
Can we go?

01:00:10.998 --> 01:00:12.367
Yeah, of course.

01:00:14.501 --> 01:00:15.501
Oh, no, no, no.

01:00:15.503 --> 01:00:16.601
- I got it.
- I got it.

01:00:16.603 --> 01:00:18.170
- I got it.
- No, no, no, I insist.

01:00:18.172 --> 01:00:21.376
No, no, no, I insist.
It's my pleasure, please.

01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:23.175
Thank you, Avi.

01:00:23.177 --> 01:00:24.108
That's very nice of you.

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:25.344
You're very welcome.

01:00:25.346 --> 01:00:26.244
Mikki.

01:00:26.246 --> 01:00:27.382
I'm coming.

01:00:52.873 --> 01:00:53.738
It was nice seeing you.

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:54.706
Good seeing you too.

01:00:54.708 --> 01:00:55.541
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:00:55.543 --> 01:00:57.311
Yeah, sounds good.

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:01.583
Bye.

01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:37.519
What's wrong with you?

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.286
Nothing.

01:01:40.288 --> 01:01:41.088
I'm fine.

01:01:42.655 --> 01:01:44.458
You don't seem fine.

01:01:50.831 --> 01:01:51.633
Ow.

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:56.834
So, when did Avi
get that new car?

01:01:56.836 --> 01:01:57.536
A few weeks ago.

01:01:57.538 --> 01:01:58.737
Why?

01:01:58.739 --> 01:02:01.541
Oh, it's a really
nice new car.

01:02:02.208 --> 01:02:05.677
What's he doing that we're not?

01:02:05.679 --> 01:02:06.677
You don't have enough?

01:02:06.679 --> 01:02:08.579
No, we have enough.

01:02:08.581 --> 01:02:10.081
That's not the point.

01:02:10.083 --> 01:02:12.450
I don't get you
everything you need?

01:02:12.452 --> 01:02:14.119
Jewelry, this fucking house?

01:02:14.121 --> 01:02:14.987
The house is amazing.

01:02:14.989 --> 01:02:15.920
The jewelry's amazing.

01:02:15.922 --> 01:02:16.956
It's not about the money.

01:02:16.958 --> 01:02:17.990
Then what is it about?

01:02:17.992 --> 01:02:19.358
I'm pregnant.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.159
What? What?

01:02:22.161 --> 01:02:24.563
You're pregnant?

01:02:24.565 --> 01:02:25.831
You're pregnant?

01:02:25.833 --> 01:02:26.731
Yeah.

01:02:26.733 --> 01:02:28.068
Oh my god.

01:02:29.202 --> 01:02:30.471
When, what?

01:02:30.972 --> 01:02:32.470
I, uh...

01:02:32.472 --> 01:02:33.572
Why aren't you happy?

01:02:33.574 --> 01:02:36.474
I am. I...

01:02:36.476 --> 01:02:38.379
What's the matter?

01:02:40.313 --> 01:02:41.847
What's the matter?

01:02:41.849 --> 01:02:42.751
Avi.

01:02:44.018 --> 01:02:46.686
They never made a dime
before you showed up.

01:02:46.688 --> 01:02:49.789
Hey, you made them
what they are.

01:02:49.791 --> 01:02:52.157
They were nothing without you.

01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:53.758
You're not the help
and they treat you

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.532
like you're Avi's
guard dog or something.

01:02:59.099 --> 01:03:01.034
If we're gonna do this,

01:03:02.503 --> 01:03:05.537
if we're gonna bring a
child into the world,

01:03:05.539 --> 01:03:10.175
everything's gonna be
different now, everything.

01:03:10.177 --> 01:03:12.413
You know what I'm saying?

01:03:13.414 --> 01:03:15.917
You know what you have to do.

01:03:18.585 --> 01:03:19.620
I do.

01:03:20.586 --> 01:03:21.588
Don't worry.

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:31.030
Avi.

01:03:31.032 --> 01:03:32.597
Yeah?

01:03:32.599 --> 01:03:33.798
Listen to me.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.767
Are you handling the Russians?

01:03:35.769 --> 01:03:36.969
Yeah.

01:03:36.971 --> 01:03:37.836
You know they're
bleeding me dry.

01:03:37.838 --> 01:03:39.271
You said...

01:03:39.273 --> 01:03:40.572
I said we're gonna take
care of it, all right?

01:03:40.574 --> 01:03:41.440
They're gonna be out
of the picture soon.

01:03:41.442 --> 01:03:42.273
Relax.

01:03:42.275 --> 01:03:43.275
It's fine.

01:03:43.277 --> 01:03:44.510
You giving me shit right now?

01:03:44.512 --> 01:03:46.679
No, but just,
it's enough with...

01:03:46.681 --> 01:03:49.014
Oh, there he is, the man
of the hour, big macher.

01:03:49.016 --> 01:03:50.048
Where you been?

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:50.883
Handling Russians with this guy?

01:03:50.885 --> 01:03:52.918
Shut the fuck up.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.588
Shut the fuck up.

01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:58.657
I wanna know
everything right now.

01:03:58.659 --> 01:04:00.193
What are you talking about?

01:04:00.195 --> 01:04:01.626
I wanna know everything
about this fucking business.

01:04:01.628 --> 01:04:04.463
How it works, how we make
money, everything now.

01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:05.831
All right, Mendel's,
first of all,

01:04:05.833 --> 01:04:06.865
is having problems
with the Russians.

01:04:06.867 --> 01:04:08.266
I'll take care
of the Russians.

01:04:08.268 --> 01:04:09.568
Don't worry about
the fucking Russians.

01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:10.534
I wanna know everything now.

01:04:10.536 --> 01:04:11.470
We already discussed this.

01:04:11.472 --> 01:04:12.871
This doesn't concern you.

01:04:12.873 --> 01:04:14.405
What concerns you
is handling Russians

01:04:14.407 --> 01:04:15.407
and if you did that...

01:04:15.409 --> 01:04:16.608
Ah!

01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:17.608
Mikki,
Mikki, Mikki, Mikki.

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:18.610
Avi.
Mikki!

01:04:25.518 --> 01:04:26.584
Relax.

01:04:26.586 --> 01:04:28.623
What's wrong with you?

01:04:31.592 --> 01:04:32.624
Get the fuck up.

01:04:32.626 --> 01:04:34.195
Okay, relax.

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:40.932
You think I'm
fucking playing games?

01:04:40.934 --> 01:04:43.735
Five fucking calls,
you don't call me back?

01:04:43.737 --> 01:04:45.570
Who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

01:04:45.572 --> 01:04:47.072
Start talking, now.

01:04:47.074 --> 01:04:48.139
What is this shit?

01:04:48.141 --> 01:04:48.940
Avi.

01:04:48.942 --> 01:04:49.943
Talk, now.

01:04:51.344 --> 01:04:52.311
I wanna know everything,
how the fucking shit works.

01:04:52.313 --> 01:04:53.811
Fine, okay, okay.

01:04:53.813 --> 01:04:55.113
I'm listening.

01:04:55.115 --> 01:04:58.318
It's called daisy
chaining, all right?

01:04:58.485 --> 01:05:01.519
So, what happens is that
in the state of New York,

01:05:01.521 --> 01:05:03.621
every gallon of gas
pumped at the pump

01:05:03.623 --> 01:05:05.190
is charged nine cents.

01:05:05.192 --> 01:05:09.360
That tax is not taken at
the pump or the gas station.

01:05:09.362 --> 01:05:11.463
It's supposed to be
taken by a wholesaler

01:05:11.465 --> 01:05:14.199
who distributes that gas
to those gas companies.

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:15.568
That's me.

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:17.101
The wholesaler's supposed
to charge a markup

01:05:17.103 --> 01:05:19.104
and report that
revenue to the IRS,

01:05:19.106 --> 01:05:22.441
but what I do, or what we do,

01:05:22.443 --> 01:05:24.209
is we create a series
of shell companies

01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:25.677
that buy and sell
gas back and forth,

01:05:25.679 --> 01:05:28.146
and this way I dissolve
those companies.

01:05:28.148 --> 01:05:29.749
I dissolve them, okay?

01:05:29.751 --> 01:05:31.349
And this way there's no trace.

01:05:31.351 --> 01:05:33.853
But the most important thing,
I keep all the tax revenue.

01:05:33.855 --> 01:05:37.222
We keep all that tax revenue.

01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:39.992
All right, and, 'cause
you guys gotta understand,

01:05:39.994 --> 01:05:42.628
this is how we make money.

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:44.862
This is how we make
money, gentlemen, okay?

01:05:44.864 --> 01:05:47.298
And if the Russians want
four out of the nine cents,

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.001
then they gotta go.

01:05:49.003 --> 01:05:51.105
Something has to be done.

01:05:52.172 --> 01:05:53.074
Okay?

01:05:56.844 --> 01:05:58.510
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:05:58.512 --> 01:06:00.148
You don't get it?

01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:03.014
I'm kidding.

01:06:03.016 --> 01:06:04.217
Was that hard?

01:06:06.887 --> 01:06:09.688
From now on, I want a
report every fucking week.

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:11.356
You understand?

01:06:11.358 --> 01:06:12.226
Every week.

01:06:19.199 --> 01:06:20.534
Arik, let's go.

01:06:23.536 --> 01:06:24.905
Every time I call.

01:06:32.713 --> 01:06:34.415
Avi, what the fuck?

01:06:37.050 --> 01:06:39.083
His dad's a big time
dude, running Manhattan,

01:06:39.085 --> 01:06:42.554
so he's like, he's sitting
on a huge stash of cash.

01:06:42.556 --> 01:06:45.956
So, I say we go in
there and knock him off.

01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:47.059
Sounds stupid.

01:06:47.061 --> 01:06:48.526
Why is that stupid?

01:06:48.528 --> 01:06:50.229
Who the fuck is gonna
rat out their own family?

01:06:50.231 --> 01:06:53.365
No, he hates his dad.

01:06:53.367 --> 01:06:55.269
What is this fucking place?

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.304
Don't worry about it.

01:07:00.306 --> 01:07:01.173
Come on.

01:07:01.175 --> 01:07:02.139
You have it?

01:07:02.141 --> 01:07:02.840
Of course, man.

01:07:02.842 --> 01:07:03.641
Let me see it.

01:07:03.643 --> 01:07:05.510
Show him, Asaf.

01:07:05.512 --> 01:07:06.845
It's right here.

01:07:06.847 --> 01:07:07.646
Bro.

01:07:08.481 --> 01:07:10.018
Check this shit out.

01:07:11.184 --> 01:07:12.751
Okay,
it's the real deal?

01:07:12.753 --> 01:07:13.519
Of course, man.

01:07:13.521 --> 01:07:14.318
It's the best.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.153
Asaf, my buddy.

01:07:15.155 --> 01:07:16.121
He served five years in

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:18.657
Explosives specialist, man.

01:07:18.659 --> 01:07:20.726
Okay, I don't like
innocent people dying.

01:07:20.728 --> 01:07:21.994
You know that, right?

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:22.793
Yeah, of course.

01:07:22.795 --> 01:07:23.697
Don't worry.

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:27.398
You said this has
a short blast radius, right?

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.934
Yeah, short and vertical.

01:07:28.936 --> 01:07:29.900
When are we doing this?

01:07:29.902 --> 01:07:31.269
Now.

01:07:31.271 --> 01:07:33.673
Dimitry, I swear to you.

01:07:34.275 --> 01:07:37.345
I had nothing to
do with any of it.

01:07:38.711 --> 01:07:40.010
Why should I believe you?

01:07:40.012 --> 01:07:41.815
'Cause I'm here.

01:07:43.951 --> 01:07:45.786
My papa's not happy

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:50.155
and when he's not happy,
I'm not fucking happy.

01:07:50.157 --> 01:07:51.159
I know.

01:07:52.592 --> 01:07:55.693
And I want us to keep a
good relationship together.

01:07:55.695 --> 01:07:59.130
See, that's why
I'm here with cash.

01:07:59.132 --> 01:08:02.200
Looks to me like
you're guilty.

01:08:02.202 --> 01:08:03.438
As promised.

01:08:15.649 --> 01:08:16.684
Good.

01:08:19.487 --> 01:08:20.852
Now, I need you to
help me find out

01:08:20.854 --> 01:08:22.553
who's knocking off my guys.

01:08:22.555 --> 01:08:26.827
That dirty fucking Israeli
with the baseball bat.

01:08:29.563 --> 01:08:30.698
Is it, Avi?

01:08:31.698 --> 01:08:33.531
You're talking about Mikki?

01:08:33.533 --> 01:08:35.901
Mikki's a low-level ex-con.

01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:38.102
Been in prison for 18 years.

01:08:38.104 --> 01:08:40.538
He's too stupid to even
spell his own name.

01:08:40.541 --> 01:08:42.274
Neither can Vlad.

01:08:43.443 --> 01:08:45.710
I give you my
word it's not Mikki,

01:08:45.712 --> 01:08:47.745
but I'll ask around.

01:08:47.747 --> 01:08:49.381
I'll let you know.

01:08:51.417 --> 01:08:54.654
If I find out
you're lying to me,

01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:57.755
you're going to pray
to your true god

01:08:57.756 --> 01:08:59.057
that I killed you here today.

01:08:59.059 --> 01:09:00.761
Do you understand?

01:09:01.795 --> 01:09:02.928
I understand.

01:09:15.207 --> 01:09:17.576
What the fuck is
Avi doing there?

01:09:17.578 --> 01:09:19.781
What the fuck is he doing?

01:09:32.524 --> 01:09:33.925
There they are, there they are.

01:09:33.926 --> 01:09:35.393
- Yeah.
- Get ready, get ready.

01:09:35.395 --> 01:09:36.929
Okay, I'm ready.

01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:38.965
Tell me when.

01:09:40.434 --> 01:09:41.399
Do it now, do it now.

01:09:41.402 --> 01:09:42.200
Now, now, now.

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.171
I just left.

01:09:44.904 --> 01:09:46.437
What the fuck are
you waiting for, now!

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:47.971
I don't know, something's
wrong with the detonator.

01:09:47.974 --> 01:09:49.944
Fuck this shit.

01:09:56.115 --> 01:09:57.851
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:10:15.769 --> 01:10:16.735
Yeah?

01:10:16.737 --> 01:10:18.269
Anatoly, it's Vlad.

01:10:18.271 --> 01:10:19.537
Yeah.

01:10:19.539 --> 01:10:22.376
Anatoly,
they killed Dimitry.

01:10:23.976 --> 01:10:25.643
Huh, what?

01:10:25.645 --> 01:10:27.012
I'm sorry to tell you.

01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:28.981
They just came out of
nowhere and they just,

01:10:28.983 --> 01:10:30.351
- he's dead.
- What?

01:10:31.984 --> 01:10:33.918
- What?
- I don't know.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.320
I was sitting right
next to him and just...

01:10:35.322 --> 01:10:36.754
What?

01:10:36.756 --> 01:10:37.755
They shot
him, he's dead.

01:10:37.757 --> 01:10:38.857
No!

01:10:38.859 --> 01:10:40.224
No!

01:10:40.226 --> 01:10:41.229
Oh, god.

01:10:41.962 --> 01:10:44.295
Fuck, fuck, fuck,

01:10:45.466 --> 01:10:47.031
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:47.033 --> 01:10:48.200
Stop
talking shit, okay?

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:49.067
Okay, okay, okay.

01:10:49.069 --> 01:10:50.501
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:10:52.572 --> 01:10:53.839
Oh, you like that?

01:10:53.841 --> 01:10:54.638
This is chaim.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.474
Try to say chaim.

01:10:56.476 --> 01:10:57.375
No, no.

01:10:57.377 --> 01:10:58.445
Hey, Mikki.

01:10:59.145 --> 01:11:00.711
Did you know Avi
was gonna be there?

01:11:00.713 --> 01:11:01.979
No one cares about Avi.

01:11:01.981 --> 01:11:03.581
Stop worrying about Avi, okay?

01:11:03.583 --> 01:11:04.482
I know, I just...

01:11:04.484 --> 01:11:05.786
Enough, stop.

01:11:07.154 --> 01:11:08.986
I think we should
do the diamond job.

01:11:08.988 --> 01:11:11.121
Hey, I'm fucking
celebrating. Stop.

01:11:11.123 --> 01:11:11.889
Have a fucking drink.

01:11:11.891 --> 01:11:12.958
Relax.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.895
Driving me fucking nuts.

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:26.874
Okay.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.930
Oh, good morning sleepyhead.

01:11:50.898 --> 01:11:52.429
What time did you get in?

01:11:52.431 --> 01:11:54.898
I don't know.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:55.866
Oh, I do.

01:11:55.868 --> 01:11:58.171
It was um, five a.m., I believe.

01:12:02.309 --> 01:12:05.744
You do remember, we're
having a child together?

01:12:05.746 --> 01:12:07.245
Keyword being together.

01:12:07.247 --> 01:12:08.015
Yeah.

01:12:13.086 --> 01:12:16.657
Oh, I gotta have the
worst fucking headache.

01:12:17.623 --> 01:12:18.425
Ah.

01:12:22.095 --> 01:12:23.129
Ah.

01:12:27.033 --> 01:12:28.066
Ah.

01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:39.210
My head is fucking killing me.

01:12:39.212 --> 01:12:39.980
Mm-hmm.

01:12:41.414 --> 01:12:42.880
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:12:42.882 --> 01:12:43.848
I'm gonna take you to the
best fucking restaurant

01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:44.816
in New York.

01:12:44.818 --> 01:12:46.084
Anywhere you wanna go.

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.018
Really?

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:49.454
Mm-hmm.

01:12:49.456 --> 01:12:50.153
I gotta shower.

01:12:50.155 --> 01:12:51.421
I'm sorry, baby.

01:12:51.423 --> 01:12:52.456
Oh, honey.

01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:53.226
You smell.

01:12:54.362 --> 01:12:56.695
The best fucking
restaurant in New York?

01:12:56.697 --> 01:12:57.995
Anywhere you wanna go.

01:12:57.997 --> 01:12:58.963
Mmm.

01:13:14.613 --> 01:13:15.847
Yeah.

01:13:15.849 --> 01:13:18.817
Mikki and Mendel
had Dimitry killed.

01:13:18.819 --> 01:13:21.889
Mikki killed Ahmed
and took the coke.

01:13:25.492 --> 01:13:29.494
I'm having them both
come to the bar tonight.

01:13:29.496 --> 01:13:31.297
You keep them there.

01:13:34.167 --> 01:13:35.534
You hear me?

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:37.137
You keep them there.

01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:43.441
What's wrong with you?

01:13:43.443 --> 01:13:44.211
Nothing.

01:13:45.279 --> 01:13:46.143
Come on, tell me.

01:13:46.145 --> 01:13:47.044
What's wrong with you?

01:13:47.046 --> 01:13:48.348
I said nothing.

01:13:53.252 --> 01:13:55.389
Your sister's pregnant.

01:13:57.190 --> 01:13:58.525
You serious?

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:00.892
Really?

01:14:00.894 --> 01:14:02.797
I'm gonna marry her.

01:14:03.831 --> 01:14:05.530
Mikki, mazel tov.

01:14:05.532 --> 01:14:07.264
You okay with that?

01:14:07.266 --> 01:14:09.267
Yeah, of course, I am.

01:14:09.269 --> 01:14:11.836
You know, that makes
us family, right?

01:14:11.838 --> 01:14:13.204
Yeah, I do.

01:14:13.206 --> 01:14:14.240
Family.

01:14:18.744 --> 01:14:21.646
All right, see you later.

01:14:21.648 --> 01:14:23.617
Hey, hold on one second.

01:14:25.185 --> 01:14:27.152
The guy with the diamonds,
you trust this guy?

01:14:27.154 --> 01:14:28.687
Yeah, I do.

01:14:28.689 --> 01:14:30.921
And he says it's insured,
so nobody gets hurt.

01:14:30.923 --> 01:14:33.424
Now, if you look at
it, we get the diamonds

01:14:33.426 --> 01:14:35.393
and they get paid out by
the insurance company,

01:14:35.395 --> 01:14:37.131
so it's a win-win.

01:14:38.931 --> 01:14:41.165
How much diamonds
are we talking about?

01:14:41.167 --> 01:14:43.000
Two million dollars worth.

01:14:43.002 --> 01:14:43.768
Two million dollars?

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:44.971
Yeah.

01:14:47.173 --> 01:14:49.109
Let me think about that.

01:14:55.748 --> 01:14:59.150
All right, get out.
I got a date with your sister.

01:14:59.152 --> 01:15:00.154
Later, Mikki.

01:15:03.657 --> 01:15:06.724
Right this way, Mikki.

01:15:06.726 --> 01:15:10.428
We have it all set
up beautiful for you.

01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:11.198
Wow.

01:15:12.966 --> 01:15:13.665
You look beautiful.

01:15:13.667 --> 01:15:14.933
Oh, thank you.

01:15:14.935 --> 01:15:16.370
Oh, thank you.

01:15:20.806 --> 01:15:22.373
- You did a good job.
- Thank you.

01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:24.075
If you need anything,
let me know, please.

01:15:24.077 --> 01:15:25.279
I appreciate it.

01:15:27.881 --> 01:15:28.647
Huh?

01:15:29.949 --> 01:15:30.751
Tell you?

01:15:31.618 --> 01:15:32.282
Evening, sir, ma'am.

01:15:32.284 --> 01:15:33.751
Hey.

01:15:33.753 --> 01:15:35.620
We have a fantastic meal
being prepared for you,

01:15:35.622 --> 01:15:38.889
but in the meantime, can I get
you something from the bar?

01:15:38.891 --> 01:15:41.392
Give me a bottle of
champagne, best one you have.

01:15:41.394 --> 01:15:42.427
Fantastic.

01:15:42.429 --> 01:15:44.995
I, water for me, please.

01:15:44.997 --> 01:15:46.330
Sparkling, flat, tap?

01:15:46.332 --> 01:15:47.764
Sparkling.

01:15:47.766 --> 01:15:48.769
Thank you.

01:15:52.337 --> 01:15:53.205
You like?

01:15:53.207 --> 01:15:55.042
It's overwhelming.

01:15:57.377 --> 01:15:58.412
What's wrong?

01:16:00.146 --> 01:16:02.216
I, Mikki, I'm nervous.

01:16:03.516 --> 01:16:05.316
About what?

01:16:05.318 --> 01:16:06.951
I'm nervous about everything.

01:16:06.953 --> 01:16:08.054
The baby, us.

01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:13.790
You have nothing
to worry about.

01:16:13.792 --> 01:16:16.227
You were right about everything.

01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:17.664
You really were.

01:16:18.832 --> 01:16:20.100
Yeah, go ahead.

01:16:23.502 --> 01:16:24.803
I can't

01:16:24.805 --> 01:16:26.338
- I can't.
- Look, we're celebrating.

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.373
Okay.

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:30.208
Enjoy.

01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:31.942
- I'll put this there.
- Thank you so much.

01:16:32.712 --> 01:16:33.510
Cheers.

01:16:33.512 --> 01:16:35.213
Cheers.

01:16:35.215 --> 01:16:38.517
You know I love
you very much, right?

01:16:38.519 --> 01:16:39.653
I love you.

01:16:43.689 --> 01:16:44.488
Mmm.

01:16:44.490 --> 01:16:45.889
Mmm.

01:16:45.891 --> 01:16:47.159
Tony, come here.

01:16:47.161 --> 01:16:48.093
Do me a favor.

01:16:48.095 --> 01:16:49.660
Don't let anybody in here.

01:16:49.662 --> 01:16:50.794
- You got it.
- All right?

01:16:50.796 --> 01:16:52.296
Keep it private.

01:16:52.298 --> 01:16:53.164
Absolutely.

01:16:53.166 --> 01:16:53.865
Thank you very much.

01:16:53.867 --> 01:16:54.868
All right.

01:16:58.171 --> 01:16:59.870
They just all do
whatever you say?

01:16:59.872 --> 01:17:00.905
Yeah, yeah, a couple
hundred dollars,

01:17:00.907 --> 01:17:02.107
they do whatever you want.

01:17:02.908 --> 01:17:03.708
I love you.

01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:04.478
Mmm.

01:17:06.845 --> 01:17:07.911
That steak was good, right?

01:17:08.715 --> 01:17:10.248
It was amazing.

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:11.282
Thank you.

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:17.391
Ah.

01:17:44.685 --> 01:17:47.419
Avi, what's going on?

01:17:47.421 --> 01:17:51.388
What's so important that
I gotta see you in person?

01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:53.259
He's outta control.

01:17:54.293 --> 01:17:56.260
- Something's gotta be done.
- Done?

01:17:56.262 --> 01:17:58.228
Whoa whoa whoa, what
do you mean done?

01:17:58.230 --> 01:17:59.465
I don't know,

01:18:00.567 --> 01:18:03.735
but we can't keep doing
business this way.

01:18:03.737 --> 01:18:04.802
You set him on the path.

01:18:04.804 --> 01:18:06.403
I mean, he's an attack dog.

01:18:06.405 --> 01:18:08.106
You can't ask an attack
dog to attack one person,

01:18:08.108 --> 01:18:09.340
not the other.

01:18:09.342 --> 01:18:12.313
They attack, that's
what they do.

01:18:15.448 --> 01:18:17.013
What if we're next?

01:18:17.015 --> 01:18:18.318
Probably are.

01:18:22.989 --> 01:18:27.258
From a business standpoint,
you just gotta change.

01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:28.558
I'll handle it.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.128
You better or we're done.

01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:31.597
I'll make a call.

01:18:32.465 --> 01:18:33.801
Do that, pal.

01:18:53.252 --> 01:18:54.585
Yeah.

01:18:54.587 --> 01:18:55.489
Go, go, go.

01:19:04.197 --> 01:19:05.365
Mendel's dead.

01:19:06.632 --> 01:19:07.600
Ahmed, dead.

01:19:09.336 --> 01:19:10.968
Look what happened Dudu.

01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:12.803
And I know I'm next.

01:19:12.805 --> 01:19:14.539
And guess what?

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:17.474
He's probably
gonna kill you too.

01:19:17.476 --> 01:19:18.576
He killed Ahmed?

01:19:18.578 --> 01:19:20.144
Of course he did.

01:19:20.146 --> 01:19:23.315
I paid him to go talk to Ahmed,
to stay away from the bar.

01:19:23.317 --> 01:19:24.682
But Mikki goes over
there, kills him,

01:19:24.684 --> 01:19:27.184
and takes all his coke.

01:19:27.186 --> 01:19:28.686
That's where he got
all the coke from.

01:19:28.688 --> 01:19:33.124
Yeah, and you know who
that coke belongs to, right?

01:19:33.126 --> 01:19:34.692
The Russians.

01:19:34.694 --> 01:19:37.394
And they know he took it and
they're gonna come after him

01:19:37.396 --> 01:19:40.531
and then they're gonna
come after your sister.

01:19:40.533 --> 01:19:42.700
Do you understand that?

01:19:42.702 --> 01:19:44.736
And you wanna protect
Esther, right?

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:45.539
Don't you?

01:19:47.506 --> 01:19:49.041
Mikki's gotta go.

01:19:51.478 --> 01:19:52.843
He doesn't give a
shit about Esther.

01:19:52.845 --> 01:19:54.579
You know that.

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:56.647
He's been fucking around
with all these other women.

01:19:56.649 --> 01:19:57.447
You know that.

01:19:57.449 --> 01:19:58.715
We all know that.

01:19:58.717 --> 01:20:00.921
He's gonna get her killed.

01:20:03.856 --> 01:20:06.891
Who took you guys after your
parents passed away, huh?

01:20:06.893 --> 01:20:08.593
I did, right?

01:20:08.595 --> 01:20:10.061
Gave you everything?

01:20:10.063 --> 01:20:13.197
Roof over your head,
jobs, everything.

01:20:13.199 --> 01:20:15.633
What's he done for you?

01:20:15.635 --> 01:20:17.034
We've all gotten
rich off this deal.

01:20:17.036 --> 01:20:18.236
What'd you get?

01:20:18.238 --> 01:20:20.103
What's he given you?

01:20:20.105 --> 01:20:20.907
Nothing.

01:20:23.609 --> 01:20:24.644
Arik.

01:20:25.645 --> 01:20:28.144
Arik, look
at me, look at me.

01:20:28.146 --> 01:20:29.515
You trust me, huh?

01:20:30.783 --> 01:20:33.284
Tell me you trust me.

01:20:33.286 --> 01:20:35.119
I trust you.

01:20:35.121 --> 01:20:37.054
We have no other choice.

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:53.937
Who is it?

01:20:53.939 --> 01:20:55.141
Arik.

01:21:02.481 --> 01:21:03.850
What's going on?

01:21:05.752 --> 01:21:06.750
Arik, what's going on?

01:21:06.752 --> 01:21:07.718
I shouldn't have done this.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:08.652
I shouldn't have done this,

01:21:08.654 --> 01:21:10.187
because now they're dead.

01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:12.089
Everybody is dead.

01:21:12.091 --> 01:21:14.159
Everybody is dead, everybody.

01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:15.326
Calm down, relax.

01:21:15.328 --> 01:21:16.361
What are you talking about?

01:21:16.363 --> 01:21:17.361
Relax?

01:21:17.363 --> 01:21:18.963
You want me to fucking relax?

01:21:18.965 --> 01:21:20.531
You want me to fucking
relax when everything

01:21:20.533 --> 01:21:23.634
is falling apart right now?

01:21:23.636 --> 01:21:24.768
Arik, what's going on?

01:21:26.105 --> 01:21:28.540
Hey, is everything okay?

01:21:28.542 --> 01:21:29.473
Yeah, it's fine, it's fine.

01:21:29.475 --> 01:21:30.840
- Go back to bed.
- Yeah.

01:21:30.842 --> 01:21:32.943
Arik, what happened?

01:21:32.945 --> 01:21:34.411
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:21:34.413 --> 01:21:36.179
I'm just talking to Mikki.

01:21:36.181 --> 01:21:37.050
We're good.

01:21:38.484 --> 01:21:40.284
Go back to bed.

01:21:44.623 --> 01:21:45.990
What's going on?

01:21:45.992 --> 01:21:47.692
Let's do the diamond job.

01:21:47.694 --> 01:21:48.660
Okay, we are
doing the diamond...

01:21:48.662 --> 01:21:50.661
No, we gotta do it now,

01:21:50.663 --> 01:21:52.196
'cause I just spoke to my guy

01:21:52.198 --> 01:21:53.865
and he said they're moving
the diamonds in the morning

01:21:53.867 --> 01:21:56.834
and if we don't do it now,
then the safe will be empty.

01:21:56.836 --> 01:21:59.370
And the Russians, they're
gonna come after us.

01:21:59.372 --> 01:22:01.305
- And Mendel, he's dead.
- What?

01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:02.139
Mendel's dead?

01:22:02.141 --> 01:22:03.174
What happened to Mendel?

01:22:03.176 --> 01:22:05.309
They got him, okay?

01:22:05.311 --> 01:22:06.643
And they're probably
gonna get me.

01:22:06.645 --> 01:22:07.977
Okay, calm down. Arik.

01:22:07.979 --> 01:22:09.280
Please.

01:22:09.282 --> 01:22:10.915
Arik, it's two o'clock
in the fucking morning.

01:22:10.917 --> 01:22:12.016
I don't wanna die, Mikki.

01:22:12.018 --> 01:22:13.183
Die? No one's dying.

01:22:13.185 --> 01:22:14.617
What are you talking about?

01:22:14.619 --> 01:22:16.420
I don't want my
sister to die. She's pregnant.

01:22:16.422 --> 01:22:17.687
Arik, are you fucking nuts?

01:22:17.689 --> 01:22:18.589
No one's dying.

01:22:18.591 --> 01:22:20.191
I got this.

01:22:20.193 --> 01:22:21.759
You think I'm gonna let anybody
fucking do anything to you?

01:22:21.761 --> 01:22:22.559
You fucking nuts?

01:22:22.561 --> 01:22:23.361
Please, Mikki.

01:22:23.363 --> 01:22:24.762
Relax.

01:22:24.764 --> 01:22:26.164
Calm the fuck down, okay?

01:22:26.166 --> 01:22:27.565
What is going on?

01:22:27.567 --> 01:22:28.766
Nothing, nothing.

01:22:28.768 --> 01:22:30.601
All right, you
wanna do it tonight?

01:22:30.603 --> 01:22:32.236
- You wanna do it tonight?
- Yes.

01:22:32.238 --> 01:22:33.336
All right, we'll
do it tonight.

01:22:33.338 --> 01:22:34.041
Okay.

01:22:37.077 --> 01:22:38.011
Calm down.

01:22:38.877 --> 01:22:39.677
What's going on?

01:22:39.679 --> 01:22:40.843
Nothing.

01:22:40.845 --> 01:22:41.678
All right, relax.

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:42.679
I'll be right back.

01:22:42.681 --> 01:22:44.014
I gotta get dressed.

01:22:44.016 --> 01:22:45.282
What
are you gonna do?

01:22:45.284 --> 01:22:46.683
- Where are you going?
- Nothing.

01:22:46.685 --> 01:22:48.018
I gotta go with your
brother for a little bit.

01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:49.320
I have a really bad
feeling about this.

01:22:49.322 --> 01:22:50.687
- I don't...
- It's fine, it's fine.

01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:51.487
Don't worry about it.

01:22:51.489 --> 01:22:52.322
Give me a minute.

01:22:52.324 --> 01:22:53.324
Go in the room.

01:23:22.154 --> 01:23:23.786
Got this, yeah?

01:23:23.788 --> 01:23:25.091
Got this, yeah?

01:23:47.814 --> 01:23:49.379
Arik, 3:24.

01:23:49.381 --> 01:23:50.613
You come back at 3:44.

01:23:50.615 --> 01:23:51.447
You understand me?

01:23:51.449 --> 01:23:52.317
20 minutes.

01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:53.651
Stop the car.

01:23:53.653 --> 01:23:55.419
Open the trunk.

01:23:55.421 --> 01:23:56.256
20 minutes.

01:25:34.386 --> 01:25:36.954
Mikki, so
what's your plan?

01:25:36.956 --> 01:25:39.691
I figure change of
place, change of luck.

01:25:39.693 --> 01:25:42.093
You remind me of
my sister, your mom.

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:43.594
But let me tell you something.

01:25:43.596 --> 01:25:46.397
There's no such thing as luck.

01:25:46.399 --> 01:25:49.536
Trust me, I know
better than anybody.
