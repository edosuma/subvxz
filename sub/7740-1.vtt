01:48.441 --> 01:50.526
Come on, Max.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.954
- Morning, Mrs Mercer.
- Oh, Chris.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.539
You're early this morning.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.916
I've got the twins waking me up
at the crack of dawn.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.668
Oh, my God, I completely forgot.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.712
- Congratulations.
- Cheers.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.173
- How are you both coping?
- It's a hell of a lot of work.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.549
I don't doubt it a second.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.093
But you'll be fine.
You were always a capable young man.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.470
You must be getting excited.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.181
- Saturday, isn't it?
- Don't remind me. So much work to do.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.474
Yeah, it'll be fine.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.309
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.519
And I'm really over the moon
for both of you.

02:41.619 --> 02:44.272
- Thank you, Mrs Mercer.
- Kate. Call me Kate.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.666
- We're not at school any more.
- Will do.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.702
What do you think of that Platters song?

03:23.912 --> 03:25.996
- The what?
- The Platters song.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.441
What for?

03:28.541 --> 03:30.276
First dance.

03:30.376 --> 03:33.279
Or think it's a bit naff to have
the same song we had at our wedding?

03:33.379 --> 03:34.906
No. Lovely song.

03:35.006 --> 03:37.799
- I've always liked it.
- Yeah, I know.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.505
Asked me how I knew

03:50.605 --> 03:53.148
My true love was true

04:09.165 --> 04:12.277
- What is it?
- A letter.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.405
Yes, I know, but who from?

04:15.505 --> 04:18.074
- It's in German.
- Yeah.

04:18.173 --> 04:20.259
What's it say?

04:21.177 --> 04:26.348
Well, I can't remember the verbs
as well as the nouns, but...

04:27.267 --> 04:30.170
but I think it says they've found her.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.172
Found who?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.674
Well, her body, anyway.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.858
God, who? Geoff.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.988
They've found Katya.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.475
Oh.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.769
You know who I'm talking about,
don't you?

04:46.869 --> 04:48.021
Of course.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.191
Cos, I remember telling you,
clear as day.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.818
Of course I remember.
I mean, it was a long time ago.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.128
Yeah, I know I told you about my Katya.

04:59.424 --> 05:05.220
She's been there over 50 years,
like something in the freezer.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.682
Now they've found her.

05:09.642 --> 05:15.480
Like that, er, Tollund Man
in the Swedish bog.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.051
Well, Danish, actually.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.011
- Hm?
- It was on the curriculum for years.

05:20.111 --> 05:22.237
I taught it to the third-formers.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.661
I'll make some more tea.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.552
Yeah, I'm going to need a dictionary.

05:47.972 --> 05:50.166
I don't know where to look.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.517
Why don't you check
in the plastic boxes?

06:07.825 --> 06:10.577
Nothing.
Nothing but "do-it-yourself" books.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.503
Ah!

06:19.754 --> 06:21.406
That's it.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.366
Yeah.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.550
Ah, thank you.

06:29.305 --> 06:32.875
You see, what's happened is
the snow has completely melted.

06:32.975 --> 06:35.295
All that's left is the ice.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.797
And that's how they found her.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.384
- What do you mean?
- Well, she's still there.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.469
- In the ice?
- Yeah.

06:43.569 --> 06:47.598
Way down, I'm sure, but the water
is very pure up there.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.560
It must be, so they can see her.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.563
- Well, haven't they taken her out?
- Not yet.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.814
Why not?

06:54.914 --> 06:57.525
Well, she's in a glacier
in the Swiss mountains, Kate.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.235
It can't be that easy.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.420
There are no roads up there.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.948
Hm.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.783
So, how do they know it's her?

07:05.883 --> 07:08.411
I mean, it might not be her at all.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.748
Well, they've made an assumption, I
suppose, from where they found her.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.167
Maybe they can tell
from what she's wearing.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.877
From what she's wearing?

07:15.977 --> 07:21.799
Oh, yeah, yeah, those, er,
airmen in... Iceland, I think it was,

07:21.899 --> 07:23.760
they were perfectly preserved.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.345
Oh, I don't remember that.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.181
Yes. I saw a documentary on it.

07:28.281 --> 07:32.617
They were the same as when they died
because of how quickly they froze.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.937
And you think that's what's happened?

07:35.037 --> 07:37.747
Well, I don't know, but you can imagine.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.863
Not sure it works like that.
Not after all this time.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.491
How strange would that be, though?

07:46.591 --> 07:49.634
She'll look like she did in 1962.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.387
And I look like this.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.717
What is it?

08:04.817 --> 08:06.902
Er, don't be cross, Kate.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.446
I'm going to have a smoke.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.984
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

08:50.154 --> 08:53.532
Please eat this. And take your pills.

08:54.408 --> 08:57.786
They've asked
if I want to go to Switzerland.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.981
Why would they ask that?

09:00.081 --> 09:02.165
Well, to see the body.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.793
- When?
- Soon, I suppose.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.412
- You aren't thinking of going?
- Don't know.

09:09.690 --> 09:12.043
- All the way to Switzerland?
- It's not that far.

09:12.143 --> 09:15.496
- There are flights from Stansted.
- Yeah, but it's far enough.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.457
- You don't think I should?
- Honestly?

09:17.557 --> 09:19.459
Well, no.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.502
I don't see the point.

09:21.602 --> 09:24.755
- Plus we've got the party on Saturday.
- I wasn't thinking of going now.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.175
- I wouldn't go now.
- Yeah, but still.

09:27.275 --> 09:30.303
I don't like the idea of you climbing
a big bloody mountain.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.638
Well, I don't think
it would come to that.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.974
You don't like going for a walk with me
on the Broads

09:35.074 --> 09:37.101
- and that's as flat as a pancake.
- I know.

09:37.201 --> 09:40.730
Like I said, Kate,
it wouldn't come to that.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.914
But still...

09:44.917 --> 09:47.487
- Don't you have to go into town?
- Oh, I can rearrange.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.697
No, you should go.

09:49.797 --> 09:51.616
It's been a bit of a shock, that's all.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.800
But I'm fine.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.013
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, positive.

10:35.926 --> 10:38.746
Oh. It looks different, all empty.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.290
Well, this is where the tables
are usually placed.

10:41.390 --> 10:45.086
The top one over there,
so that everyone can see you.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.588
We won't be having a top table,
but thank you.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.798
Really?

10:48.898 --> 10:51.384
A top table is so lovely
at an event like this.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.761
The two of you as a focal point
of the room.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.846
We're not trying to recreate
the wedding.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.640
It's just a party.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.949
Yes, well, it's your choice, of course.

11:01.077 --> 11:06.148
I will say, though, it's a wonderful
place, location-wise, for an anniversary.

11:06.248 --> 11:08.109
It's your 40th, isn't it?

11:08.209 --> 11:09.402
45th.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.586
That's an unusual one to celebrate.

11:13.047 --> 11:17.676
My husband was ill and our 40th
was cancelled, so we had to rearrange.

11:18.552 --> 11:22.472
Well, I must try and make this one
super-special, then, mustn't I?

11:24.642 --> 11:28.895
And this really is a great venue
for such an event.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.564
So full of history, you see?

11:31.941 --> 11:33.801
Like a good marriage.

11:33.901 --> 11:38.014
Did you know that the Trafalgar Ball
was held here?

11:38.114 --> 11:39.390
Yes, your assistant told me.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.392
It was in 1805.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.811
Can you imagine
how incredible that must have been?

11:43.911 --> 11:48.915
Everyone here, dressed in their finest,
celebrating such an achievement.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.501
Wasn't Nelson killed?

11:51.961 --> 11:53.837
But the battle was won.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.841
And that has to be worth celebrating,
doesn't it?

12:01.303 --> 12:05.791
We had a table at our wedding,
a top table, but we didn't like it at all.

12:05.891 --> 12:09.060
My husband thought it
a horribly bourgeois tradition.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.674
Shall we have a look at the canapÃ© list?

12:13.774 --> 12:15.551
Er, yes, indeed.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.736
I'll be right back.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.029
No rush.

13:35.064 --> 13:38.274
You have reached Geoff and Kate.
Please leave a message.

14:01.590 --> 14:04.133
You haven't listened to this
for a long time.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.539
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.124
What have you done to your finger?

14:10.224 --> 14:15.212
Oh, yeah, I was, er... trying to mend the
lavatory and, er, well, I cut me thumb.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.422
Ugh.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.174
Did you manage to fix it?

14:18.274 --> 14:20.441
It needs a new ballcock, I think.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.722
- Tried calling earlier on.
- Did you leave a message?

14:24.822 --> 14:26.932
No, I just wanted to check
you were all right.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.033
Right.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.082
- What are you reading?
- Kierkegaard.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.793
Gracious,
are you having a go at that again?

14:40.462 --> 14:43.199
You know, you have three editions
of that book,

14:43.299 --> 14:47.176
and I don't think you've got past
chapter two in any of them.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.592
Yeah, it's been an odd day.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.427
It sure has.

15:03.527 --> 15:08.140
I just, er... stayed at home,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.559
you know, grappling with the ballcock.

15:10.659 --> 15:12.561
But you're right.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.979
I hardly go walking any more.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.650
And it was a nice day, so off I went.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.209
- So, where did you go?
- Just to the village.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.737
To buy cigarettes?

15:24.632 --> 15:27.326
I haven't lost my sense of smell,
you know?

15:27.426 --> 15:30.329
I just don't want us
to start smoking again.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.872
No, I won't, I won't.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.165
I promise.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.251
OK. Go on.

15:35.351 --> 15:40.422
So, I was in the village,
and I don't know what happened

15:40.522 --> 15:43.759
but that racist
from the community centre...

15:43.859 --> 15:45.469
Mm. Sandra Wilkins.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.654
Yeah, her.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.809
She came up to me, right up to me face,

15:51.909 --> 15:55.078
and she kept asking me
if I was all right.

15:56.372 --> 16:00.333
And when I said I was,
she wouldn't believe me.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.212
And... I wasn't doing anything.

16:04.838 --> 16:10.160
Nothing. Just sitting on the bench
by the duck pond,

16:10.260 --> 16:12.595
minding me own business
and getting some air.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.040
All done.

16:15.140 --> 16:19.251
- All I was doing, I promise.
- I believe you.

16:19.936 --> 16:21.589
She's a dreadful woman.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.773
- Just ignore her.
- Mm.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.767
Is it all right?

16:33.867 --> 16:35.185
Oh, it's great. Great.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.370
Yeah. Mm.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.774
A drop more?

16:40.874 --> 16:42.959
Mm, thank you.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.608
- What?
- Nothing.

17:14.282 --> 17:18.077
- There's something I want to tell you.
- OK.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.690
You know, I feel sure
I've told you before,

17:21.790 --> 17:25.667
but it was a long time ago,
so, I mean, I could be wrong.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.993
- OK, go on.
- Yeah.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.595
Um, I was her next of kin.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.084
What do you mean?

17:40.184 --> 17:42.127
Well, officially.

17:42.227 --> 17:45.464
I was her next of kin.
I'm sure I told you this before, Kate.

17:45.564 --> 17:49.609
I think I would remember my husband
being another woman's next of kin.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.015
- Why?
- Why what?

17:55.115 --> 17:57.142
Well, why were you her next of kin?

17:57.242 --> 17:59.520
Because they thought we were married.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.773
- Who did?
- The authorities. People.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.149
What made them think that?

18:04.249 --> 18:06.334
We told them we were.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.405
You weren't, though?

18:09.505 --> 18:11.991
Oh, no, no, no. No, hell, no.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.202
We just had to pretend, so people
would let us stay in their houses.

18:15.302 --> 18:20.514
Different in those days, Kate,
and then after the accident...

18:22.559 --> 18:24.753
You're not lying to me?

18:24.853 --> 18:28.382
No. Kate, she wore a ring on her finger.

18:28.482 --> 18:33.236
It was a small wooden ring,
like a curtain ring, made of oak.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.473
Funny you'd remember that.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.658
Well, it wasn't real.

18:47.126 --> 18:51.671
OK, you could've...
you could've just told me, Geoff.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.883
I thought I had.

18:56.218 --> 19:01.430
If I hadn't, well, it's hardly, er...

19:02.057 --> 19:04.668
the sort of thing you tell

19:04.768 --> 19:08.229
your beautiful new girlfriend, is it?

19:11.859 --> 19:13.943
I suppose not.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.769
I think I'm going to have a...
go upstairs and have a bath.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.646
I've got lots to do tomorrow.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.316
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yes. Yes.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.567
Yeah, really, I am.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.071
I can hardly be cross with something
that happened before we existed, can I?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.255
Not really.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.176
Still...

20:22.679 --> 20:25.139
I suppose a cuddle's
out of the question.

20:38.278 --> 20:41.739
It doesn't even feel like it was me
that was there.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.560
Do you know what I mean?

20:44.660 --> 20:46.270
How long had you been up there?

20:46.370 --> 20:49.064
Oh, six or seven weeks, I suppose.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.249
It seemed a lot longer.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.695
We had a map, er, to start with.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.505
It was so bloody unreliable.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.383
I've still got it somewhere.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.705
Yeah, we were getting higher
into the mountains

21:04.805 --> 21:09.626
and I decided it would be best
if we found someone,

21:09.726 --> 21:13.437
you know, to help us
get to the Italian border.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.508
- A guide?
- Yeah, wasn't really a guide.

21:16.608 --> 21:20.319
This swarthy little bastard
who thought he was Jack Kerouac.

21:21.154 --> 21:24.073
- You always did hate Kerouac.
- Yes, I did.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.060
Maybe you were jealous.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.370
- What, of Jack Kerouac?
- Of the guide.

21:31.456 --> 21:32.858
Was he flirting with her?

21:32.958 --> 21:36.862
Well, they did have, er... the language.

21:36.962 --> 21:40.923
My German, it wasn't that great,
what with its accent.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.827
They laughed a lot.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.580
He was forever making these jokes
I didn't get.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.182
- Oh, God, you wouldn't like that.
- No, I didn't.

21:51.601 --> 21:57.174
They were walking up ahead,
more than they needed to perhaps,

21:57.274 --> 22:01.444
or... maybe I just let them,
I don't know.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.574
We were on a track round this rock,

22:07.576 --> 22:11.871
and the glacier was on the right,
below us.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.566
Way down.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.860
Beautiful thing, it was.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.196
You'd love the landscape
out there, Kate.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.380
- You really would.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.803
They were out of sight,
round the corner,

22:29.556 --> 22:34.310
and the last sound but one
that I heard was her laughter.

22:35.103 --> 22:38.314
And, Christ, did it annoy me.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.568
But then, there was a scream.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.905
It wasn't a loud scream, neither.

22:46.406 --> 22:52.203
Sort of outpouring of air from her lungs,
from the shock, I suppose.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.456
It was low and guttural,

22:56.458 --> 23:01.745
not like her voice,
which was soft, higher-pitched.

23:03.807 --> 23:06.034
God, that's just horrible.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.495
Mm. Mm.

23:08.595 --> 23:10.163
And then what?

23:10.263 --> 23:12.124
That was it, really.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.266
When I got there, she'd gone.

23:15.936 --> 23:18.145
And Kerouac was looking down this hole.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.384
A fissure.

23:22.484 --> 23:26.946
Yeah, a fissure, I suppose you'd call it,
like a narrow, narrow crack in the rock.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.324
Do you remember that one in Scotland?

23:32.619 --> 23:34.771
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah. Well, it was like that one.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.706
- Yeah.
- Only much deeper.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.252
And Kerouac was just standing there.

23:43.171 --> 23:47.550
His face, oddly enough,
it looked almost yellow.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.958
Was she blonde?

23:55.058 --> 23:57.101
- Sorry?
- Did she have blonde hair?

23:57.686 --> 23:59.880
Oh, no, no. She had dark hair.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.214
- Like mine, then.
- Mm.

24:01.314 --> 24:03.399
I mean, not now.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.026
Yeah, like yours.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.222
How old was she?

24:09.322 --> 24:15.896
She was two years older than me,
and that was '62.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.981
Yeah, so she was about 27.

24:18.081 --> 24:20.166
Yeah.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.945
My mum died that year.

24:24.045 --> 24:25.906
- Did she?
- Yeah. Mm.

24:26.006 --> 24:29.034
- I don't know why that's funny but it is.
- Funny?

24:29.134 --> 24:33.246
Well, we didn't know each other then,
you and I,

24:33.346 --> 24:37.501
but we were both going through something
really unpleasant, and...

24:37.601 --> 24:41.838
and yet we never talked about it in all
the years that we've known each other.

24:41.938 --> 24:45.399
- Never.
- No. Never have.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.627
I'm tired.

25:05.879 --> 25:08.005
Shall I turn off the light?

25:08.924 --> 25:11.008
Yeah.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.940
I'm quite tired, too.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.173
Come on.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.176
Max!

26:01.434 --> 26:02.544
Max!

26:02.644 --> 26:05.088
Yeah, boy! Come on!

26:05.188 --> 26:07.273
Come on! Good boy.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.870
You're up early this morning.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.873
Yeah, I thought I might come into town
with you, if you don't mind.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.124
No, of course I don't mind.

26:41.224 --> 26:44.544
Yeah, I want to go to Thorns,
get a new ballcock.

26:44.644 --> 26:46.729
Oh, good.

26:50.817 --> 26:53.944
Do you think my library card
will still be valid, Kate?

26:54.738 --> 26:58.058
- I don't see why not.
- I might pop in there if there's time.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.242
Have a bit of a browse.

27:00.535 --> 27:03.355
- We could have some lunch.
- Yeah, great.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.566
Well, er, I'll just go do
what I have to do.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.485
Give us a shout when you're ready.

27:08.585 --> 27:09.694
OK.

27:09.794 --> 27:13.213
About an hour. I've got to call
the florist and one or two things.

27:33.443 --> 27:37.973
Do you think the library will have
anything on climate change?

27:38.073 --> 27:40.658
- On what?
- Climate change.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.177
- Sorry I'm late.
- All right.

28:00.970 --> 28:03.206
- Did you get the thing?
- What thing?

28:03.306 --> 28:05.667
- The ballcock.
- Er, they have to order it.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.851
I'll pick it up in a few days.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.423
What do you want to eat?

28:11.523 --> 28:14.175
We've got to think a lot more
about the environment.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.636
- Well, we recycle.
- Do we?

28:16.736 --> 28:19.598
- Yeah. Well, I try to, anyway.
- Well, we should.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.518
You're welcome to clean out the dog cans
and put them in the right bins.

28:23.618 --> 28:27.689
Because these glaciers, they're melting
a lot more than people imagined,

28:27.789 --> 28:31.067
- and the water's just not coming down.
- It's got to go somewhere.

28:31.167 --> 28:35.739
No, it's saturating into the rock beneath,
and it's building up and up and up.

28:35.839 --> 28:36.948
- Like...
- Like a dam.

28:37.048 --> 28:41.686
Like a dam, yeah. It's waiting,
waiting, waiting, and then...

28:43.288 --> 28:45.081
Careful. No warning.

28:45.181 --> 28:49.127
Come down like a tsunami,
wipe out everything in its path.

28:49.227 --> 28:54.633
Schools, churches, people in cafes
drinking their coffee,

28:54.733 --> 28:57.693
old men in shops
tinkering with their cuckoo clocks.

28:59.612 --> 29:02.432
And if they hadn't found her,
that's when she'd have come down,

29:02.532 --> 29:04.893
with all the rock and debris.

29:04.993 --> 29:07.077
We'll be long dead by then.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.209
Oh.

29:15.378 --> 29:16.571
Put your book away.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.756
Oh, yeah.

29:22.552 --> 29:25.622
- You screening my calls, Kate?
- Not really.

29:25.722 --> 29:26.831
- Hello.
- Hi.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.541
- Sally!
- Hi, Geoff.

29:28.641 --> 29:30.585
That's my favourite one, there.

29:30.685 --> 29:34.089
OK, Mum. I think it's enough now.
It's getting really boring.

29:34.189 --> 29:37.384
- I'm proud of my grandson.
- Sally, I want to have a look at Charley.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.960
These are so lovely.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.180
And the photos are really beautiful.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.557
- Aren't they?
- Sally's going to be a photographer.

29:44.657 --> 29:47.435
I'm not. I'm just taking an evening
course, just for the fun of it.

29:47.535 --> 29:48.603
It's nothing grand.

29:48.703 --> 29:51.189
- But it might lead to something.
- Or it might not.

29:51.289 --> 29:54.567
We shall see, won't we?
But you should concentrate on it.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.779
I took it up about three months ago.

29:57.879 --> 30:01.449
It's a good instrument to learn.
You can play anything on the ukulele.

30:01.549 --> 30:06.579
It's not just George Formby, which is good
because, as you know, I always hated him.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.873
The Internet is absolutely brilliant.

30:08.973 --> 30:12.085
If you go to a guy
called justinguitars.com,

30:12.185 --> 30:14.546
he actually teaches guitar,
but it's all free.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.048
He's started, er,
teaching ukulele as well.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.591
See you later. Have a nice time.

30:18.691 --> 30:20.301
All right, see you later.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.054
I don't think... I don't think
Geoff wanted to go to the pub.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.140
It's either that
or he comes shopping with us.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.891
We could have gone to the pub,
all of us.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.852
Know what he's like
with daytime drinking.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.603
Oh, he'll be all right.

30:30.703 --> 30:32.939
Anyway, it gives him a chance to vent.

30:33.039 --> 30:34.774
- About what?
- About you.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.192
Mum!

30:36.292 --> 30:39.112
Not about you as such,
but about the party.

30:39.212 --> 30:41.406
What do you mean about...
vent about the party?

30:41.506 --> 30:44.200
When I think how awful George was
before our 40th,

30:44.300 --> 30:46.077
I was that close to divorcing him.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.495
Ignore her.

30:47.595 --> 30:50.472
So, what's going to happen
with your dress? What would you like?

30:56.104 --> 30:58.730
So, should I not be having a party?

30:59.232 --> 31:00.508
Of course you should.

31:00.608 --> 31:02.385
It is a lot of pressure for both of us.

31:02.485 --> 31:04.763
And I hate parties anyway,
at the best of times.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.056
I mean, I never even
celebrate my birthday.

31:07.156 --> 31:09.517
No, no, no, no, no, you have to.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.478
I mean, that's the strange thing.

31:11.578 --> 31:15.064
George was awful, but then do you
remember him at the actual party?

31:15.164 --> 31:16.649
How much he cried?

31:16.749 --> 31:18.834
And not only during the speeches.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.713
Yeah, he was very sweet.

31:23.631 --> 31:25.366
That's why these things are important.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.750
What, to make our husbands cry?

31:28.035 --> 31:31.039
Not just husbands, all men.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.665
It's always them that break first.

31:32.765 --> 31:35.752
Sally's wedding, Charley's christening.

31:35.852 --> 31:39.354
We hold it together cos we already
know how important these things are.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.677
Geoff is not much of a crier.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.862
I bet he cried at your wedding.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.823
I don't remember.

31:53.244 --> 31:56.981
If it's some twist of evolution

31:57.081 --> 32:01.528
that needs men to be obsessed
by their obituaries, their legacies,

32:01.628 --> 32:05.698
then maybe it's ours to nudge them
into realising what's really important

32:05.798 --> 32:09.551
before they kill themselves,
you know, with the disappointment.

32:23.858 --> 32:25.877
- Morning.
- Oh.

32:26.483 --> 32:28.370
I nodded off.

32:30.698 --> 32:32.600
What did you think of Sally's photos?

32:32.700 --> 32:35.562
- Mm?
- Sally's photos.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.313
I think she's got a very good eye.

32:37.413 --> 32:39.399
Oh, sure. Yeah. Mm.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.150
Mm.

32:41.250 --> 32:45.572
I sometimes think it's a shame not to
have more photos around the house.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.949
We could put some up.

32:48.049 --> 32:51.119
Yeah, but we don't have any. Not really.

32:51.219 --> 32:55.377
I mean, not like Lena does
with her wall display.

33:01.354 --> 33:06.149
I suppose it's because they've got
children and grandchildren, and...

33:08.987 --> 33:12.823
I guess we didn't see the point of
taking pictures of ourselves.

33:13.866 --> 33:15.476
Would have been a bit vain.

33:15.576 --> 33:19.439
You used to say that everybody
taking pictures all the time

33:19.539 --> 33:21.941
stopped anyone having any fun.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.902
- Did I?
- You did.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.336
- Sounds like something I'd say.
- Mm-hm.

33:28.798 --> 33:30.617
You had a camera, once.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.702
- Yeah, a Yashica.
- Mm, a Yashica.

33:32.802 --> 33:34.162
Yeah, I've still got it.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.346
It's in the loft.

33:40.560 --> 33:44.104
Now that we're older, though,
it... it's a shame.

33:46.232 --> 33:48.316
What would you want photos of?

33:51.612 --> 33:54.307
- Max when he was a pup.
- Mm-hm.

33:54.407 --> 33:56.116
Tessa before him.

33:57.952 --> 34:03.040
You when you were decorating Clitheroe
and you hammered that nail into your hand.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.525
You want a photograph of that?

34:04.625 --> 34:05.944
Oh, you know what I mean.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.029
It was our first house.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.213
It was.

34:11.299 --> 34:14.284
Yeah, it was my first home
since leaving home,

34:14.385 --> 34:16.969
since leaving my parents,
leaving my father.

34:21.976 --> 34:25.380
I suppose we don't realise at the time

34:25.480 --> 34:28.065
but those memories...

34:30.568 --> 34:32.444
...they're the things, aren't they?

34:34.405 --> 34:39.618
I'd want a picture of you
at the Leeds Mecca.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.370
That's where we met.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.831
You were a bloody knockout.

34:45.208 --> 34:48.860
Oh, it's odd, isn't it,
thinking of us back then?

34:48.960 --> 34:54.826
I wasn't even 20, and you were so cool,
with your cigarette hanging in your mouth.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.467
Mm.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.098
Tell you what.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.292
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

35:03.392 --> 35:05.044
- We can move the...
- Oh, bugger off!

35:05.144 --> 35:06.254
Come on.

35:06.354 --> 35:10.598
I'm not prancing around
in the living room at this time of night.

35:39.314 --> 35:41.054
Over the top, yeah.

36:05.913 --> 36:07.998
We ain't 20 any more.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.109
No.

36:10.209 --> 36:12.294
Let's go upstairs.

36:34.275 --> 36:36.359
Come on with ya.

36:45.894 --> 36:48.121
Hope I can remember what you do.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.918
I'll show you.

36:58.799 --> 37:01.244
- How are you doing down there?
- I think I'm ready.

37:01.344 --> 37:02.453
Yeah?

37:02.553 --> 37:05.331
- You don't want me to go on top?
- No, I'm nearly there.

37:05.431 --> 37:07.208
Oh, you are, too.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.351
Oh, there you go.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.547
Oh, yeah.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.522
Oh.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.070
A kiss.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.164
Open your eyes.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.294
- Uh...
- Oh, shit.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.632
Oh, bugger.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.385
- I think I've lost it.
- I...

37:45.888 --> 37:47.973
OK, OK, OK.

37:52.436 --> 37:55.725
Geoff, it's OK, it's OK.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.404
Hey.

38:03.489 --> 38:06.559
- Aw...
- It's OK.

38:06.659 --> 38:09.327
No, let's just go to sleep.

39:25.821 --> 39:27.556
Geoff?

39:27.656 --> 39:29.699
What are you doing?

39:30.785 --> 39:32.952
- Geoff?
- I'm OK, Kate.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.690
Please come down. This is ridiculous.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.874
I'm OK.

39:39.835 --> 39:41.570
What's that in your hand?

39:41.670 --> 39:43.322
Nothing.

39:43.422 --> 39:46.492
- Is it her?
- I found it.

39:46.592 --> 39:49.704
You didn't find it. You went looking
for it in the middle of the night

39:49.804 --> 39:52.540
and that's not the same thing at all.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.250
- Let me see it.
- No.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.711
Please, Geoff. Can I see it?

39:56.811 --> 39:59.046
Please, Kate, just go back to bed.

39:59.146 --> 40:01.231
Show me the bloody picture!

40:03.609 --> 40:06.178
It's just a picture. It's all it is.

40:06.278 --> 40:08.988
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just a fucking picture.

40:24.296 --> 40:26.381
Thanks.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.113
Max!

40:54.034 --> 40:56.119
Come on!

41:26.275 --> 41:29.053
Are you getting someone
to do your makeup on Saturday?

41:29.153 --> 41:31.237
I wasn't thinking of it.

41:31.363 --> 41:34.433
I know this girl. She's very subtle.

41:34.533 --> 41:37.593
You wouldn't have to worry about
looking like a hooker.

41:40.831 --> 41:44.860
Sally's got this amazing roll-on thing,
zaps away dark circles.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.446
I'm sure you could borrow it.

41:47.546 --> 41:50.908
If I'm looking tired,
you can just tell me.

41:51.008 --> 41:53.134
You're looking tired.

41:56.472 --> 41:58.556
I'm fine.

41:59.391 --> 42:01.676
Ugh, this weather.

42:05.022 --> 42:07.007
I'm just telling you what George said.

42:07.107 --> 42:09.927
I'm not trying to upset you.
Really, I'm not.

42:10.027 --> 42:12.346
I'm not upset,
but you're not telling me anything.

42:12.446 --> 42:15.182
You're just saying that Geoff
was in a strange mood.

42:15.282 --> 42:17.367
That's what George said.

42:17.743 --> 42:19.827
Did Geoff say anything?

42:20.246 --> 42:21.689
Like what?

42:21.789 --> 42:23.482
That's what I'm asking you.

42:23.582 --> 42:27.301
- About the party?
- No, not about the party.

42:27.686 --> 42:30.262
They were talking politics.

42:30.681 --> 42:33.409
- That's it?
- Well, he was very aggressive.

42:33.509 --> 42:36.120
Well, I'm sure George
can stand up for himself.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.247
He was acting like he used to.

42:38.347 --> 42:40.431
Meaning?

42:40.808 --> 42:43.252
Like that time he kept accusing me
of being a fascist

42:43.352 --> 42:45.421
in front of all my friends
at my birthday

42:45.521 --> 42:49.341
just because I dared to say that Thatcher
hadn't done such a bad job of it.

42:49.441 --> 42:51.526
I mean, I hadn't even voted for her.

42:52.444 --> 42:54.013
It wasn't funny, Kate.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.639
No.

42:55.739 --> 42:58.017
Very upsetting.

42:58.117 --> 43:00.201
He kept doing a Nazi salute.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.499
All right, it was a little bit funny.

43:10.087 --> 43:11.614
Oh, I'm sorry.

43:11.714 --> 43:13.532
I shouldn't have brought it up.

43:13.632 --> 43:15.993
You know what Geoff's like.

43:16.093 --> 43:18.678
He gets over-passionate about things.

43:19.638 --> 43:22.223
I suppose that's why
you fell in love with him.

43:24.184 --> 43:26.269
Yes.

43:37.156 --> 43:39.433
Oh, er, there's another thing.

43:39.533 --> 43:40.976
What?

43:41.076 --> 43:44.522
Geoff says he's not sure
that he wants to go to the works lunch.

43:44.622 --> 43:45.856
At Crawley's?

43:45.956 --> 43:47.650
- But it's tomorrow.
- I know.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.276
And it's been organised for so long.

43:49.376 --> 43:52.446
George was looking forward to
getting the old gang together but if...

43:52.546 --> 43:54.073
Well, did he say why?

43:54.173 --> 43:56.257
Don't think so.

43:58.385 --> 43:59.578
I'll speak to him.

43:59.678 --> 44:01.247
Er, maybe it doesn't matter.

44:01.347 --> 44:03.431
No, I'll speak to him.

44:15.611 --> 44:16.762
Ladies...

44:16.862 --> 44:18.695
Full, full?

44:19.490 --> 44:21.616
Do you want more milk?

44:25.320 --> 44:26.772
Yes.

44:26.872 --> 44:28.706
Biscuit? No?

44:30.793 --> 44:32.027
No?

44:32.127 --> 44:34.572
Well, I'll leave them there.
And I'll take one.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.198
- Thank you.
- After that,

44:36.298 --> 44:39.410
the merchants used these
newly created waterways,

44:39.510 --> 44:43.539
and over the years
they were cut deeper and wider,

44:43.639 --> 44:46.208
and this is why the Broads
are as they are today

44:46.308 --> 44:48.059
for all of you to enjoy.

44:48.769 --> 44:53.632
Now, just imagine if those Romans
had found peat elsewhere

44:53.732 --> 44:57.219
or chosen to dig
in another part of the country.

44:57.319 --> 44:59.404
Then these broads
wouldn't be here at all.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.004
Is that Geoff?

46:40.297 --> 46:42.032
Yes, it is, yeah.

46:42.132 --> 46:44.217
What's he doing?

46:44.510 --> 46:46.412
Is he smoking again?

46:46.512 --> 46:48.638
Looks like it.

46:51.892 --> 46:54.685
You should get him to shave
before the big day too.

47:15.123 --> 47:17.750
- Hello, Geoffrey.
- Hello, Lena.

47:19.378 --> 47:21.447
Hope you've got your speech prepared.

47:21.547 --> 47:24.340
I want to hear nice things
about Kate on Saturday.

47:32.015 --> 47:35.017
So, I hear you don't want to
go to the Crawley's lunch.

47:38.105 --> 47:40.507
I don't mind if you don't,
but I wondered why.

47:40.607 --> 47:42.692
I just don't.

47:43.318 --> 47:45.763
You've been looking forward
to seeing everyone again.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.822
You've been talking about it for weeks.

47:49.157 --> 47:52.102
- Why don't you want to go?
- I've got me reasons.

47:52.202 --> 47:53.395
Which are?

47:53.495 --> 47:55.981
Why does it matter to you
if I go or not?

47:56.081 --> 47:57.816
It doesn't, but it's been arranged.

47:57.916 --> 47:58.984
So?

47:59.084 --> 48:03.989
So you can't just back out of things
simply because you don't feel like it.

48:04.089 --> 48:06.473
Even when you have reasons.

48:12.472 --> 48:14.750
And George will be very upset.

48:14.850 --> 48:18.170
He's... well, he's been
organising it for weeks.

48:18.270 --> 48:20.354
- And he's your friend.
- Oh, fine.

48:21.106 --> 48:24.108
- Then you'll go?
- Well, that's what I said, didn't I?

48:30.115 --> 48:35.521
Some days, we forgot all about
getting to Italy. Just stayed put.

48:35.621 --> 48:37.648
We were being heedless.

48:37.748 --> 48:40.317
I think that's the word I'm looking for.

48:40.417 --> 48:41.610
Heedless?

48:41.710 --> 48:43.794
Heedless.

48:44.046 --> 48:46.365
Back in her Berlin,
the Wall was going up

48:46.465 --> 48:49.926
and in America
we'd just had the Bay of Pigs.

48:51.178 --> 48:55.473
But up there,
we weren't thinking about all that.

48:56.141 --> 48:58.935
Weren't thinking about our future.

48:59.937 --> 49:02.130
But, at the same time,
we weren't heedless at all.

49:02.230 --> 49:05.092
How can you be when,
when you know what your purpose is?

49:05.192 --> 49:08.345
When every day seems to have
some point to it.

49:08.445 --> 49:10.780
Finding somewhere to stay, finding food.

49:11.865 --> 49:13.950
And the days we didn't go anywhere,

49:14.076 --> 49:15.519
they seemed just as purposeful

49:15.619 --> 49:20.915
as when we set out in complete seriousness
at four in the fucking morning.

49:21.959 --> 49:27.990
I think, um... I think that's
the worst part of getting decrepit,

49:28.090 --> 49:31.717
losing that... purposefulness.

49:33.428 --> 49:37.974
I was remembering today
how we used to see these flowers.

49:38.725 --> 49:41.185
Some sort of violet, I think they were.

49:42.104 --> 49:46.633
They'd find a patch of grass
where the snow had melted

49:46.733 --> 49:48.818
and they'd just spring up.

49:49.194 --> 49:53.265
I know they were only flowers,
but they seemed so determined.

49:53.365 --> 49:55.449
Brave, even.

49:56.201 --> 49:59.036
And that's how I see Katya and me.

50:00.163 --> 50:04.959
Wandering around,
turning our backs on civilisation.

50:05.627 --> 50:07.446
Brave?

50:07.546 --> 50:09.630
In a way.

50:09.881 --> 50:11.658
Don't you think?

50:11.758 --> 50:13.243
Not really.

50:13.343 --> 50:15.287
Why not?

50:15.387 --> 50:17.831
I mean, what were you actually doing?

50:17.931 --> 50:20.599
You're just climbing up
some bloody mountain.

50:21.977 --> 50:25.062
Well, I'm not saying
what we did was out of bravery.

50:28.233 --> 50:31.610
I think you were just chasing a girl
who wanted to be chased.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.120
You didn't know her.

50:41.955 --> 50:43.956
No.

50:44.624 --> 50:46.709
I didn't.

50:48.837 --> 50:50.921
I'm tired.

50:52.215 --> 50:54.826
I want to ask you something
before we go to sleep.

50:54.926 --> 50:57.011
What's that?

51:00.515 --> 51:05.545
If she hadn't died,
if you had got to Italy,

51:05.645 --> 51:07.772
would you have married her for real?

51:09.691 --> 51:12.344
But we didn't get to Italy, did we?

51:12.444 --> 51:13.887
And she did die.

51:13.987 --> 51:15.889
Yeah, but if you had.

51:15.989 --> 51:20.227
I thought you didn't
like theoretical questions.

51:20.327 --> 51:22.369
Just answer me.

51:23.205 --> 51:25.289
Yes.

51:30.587 --> 51:32.572
Yes, you would have married her?

51:32.672 --> 51:34.507
Yes.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.843
We would have married each other.

51:51.316 --> 51:53.734
I don't think I can
talk about her any more.

51:55.737 --> 51:59.782
I know I said I could, but I can't.

53:30.415 --> 53:32.067
Anyone you know still there?

53:32.167 --> 53:34.251
What? No, they're all new.

53:44.346 --> 53:46.039
OK, then, I'll see you later.

53:46.139 --> 53:47.874
Yeah.

53:47.974 --> 53:50.059
Hang on.

53:51.436 --> 53:52.921
Just try and enjoy yourself today.

53:53.021 --> 53:55.105
Yeah. I'll try.

56:19.250 --> 56:21.335
Max, shut up!

59:55.925 --> 59:58.010
Oh...

01:00:58.237 --> 01:00:59.806
Hello.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:02.225
- Mrs Mercer?
- Yes, it is.

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:03.977
Hi, it's George the DJ.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.161
Oh, yes, I meant to call you.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.982
I need the songs for Saturday.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.291
Er, song? Oh, songs, yes.

01:01:11.876 --> 01:01:15.321
Er... just a minute.

01:01:15.421 --> 01:01:17.422
Um...

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:23.246
- Happy Together by The Turtles.
- OK, good choice.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:26.473
For What It's Worth
by Buffalo Springfield.

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:30.644
Um, Your Precious Love by Marvin Gaye.

01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:34.731
And Higher And Higher by...

01:01:36.442 --> 01:01:37.927
I don't remember who that's by.

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:39.887
Is it Jackie Wilson?

01:01:39.987 --> 01:01:42.015
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:45.242
- What about Your Song by Elton John?
- No. No Elton John.

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:51.289
What else? I haven't got my list.

01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:58.406
The Moody Blues?

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:00.158
That's enough.

01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:02.744
What about your first dance?

01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:05.053
Smoke Gets In Your Eyes by The Platters.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:07.973
Yeah, thank you. Thank you so much.
Goodbye.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.533
How was it?

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.717
Fucking endless.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:29.706
You wouldn't fucking believe
what they've done to the place.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.624
It's all been streamlined.

01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:35.002
My first job on the floor
doesn't exist any more.

01:03:35.102 --> 01:03:39.105
I tell you, if I was still in management,
I wouldn't have let that happen.

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.467
And the unions, they don't give a shit.

01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:45.070
Well, maybe they do
and nobody takes any notice.

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:55.940
And how the lads have descended
into old age, it's not pretty.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:00.069
And there's George,
wanging on about his fucking ukulele.

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:02.989
The worst part of it
is that they all seemed interested.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:07.452
And Len, he's got a villa
on the Algarve.

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.245
Do you remember Red Len?

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.080
We used to call him Len-in,

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:16.043
and now all he can talk about
is playing golf on the Al-fucking-garve

01:04:16.143 --> 01:04:18.395
with his grandson, who's a banker.

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:21.883
Red Len, with a banker for a grandson.

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:23.233
Fuck me!

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:38.363
Hello, ladies. Have a good day, ladies.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:42.100
Would anybody like one,
this week's Big Issue?

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:44.828
Could I interest you in a Big Issue?

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:48.331
Would anybody like one,
this week's Big Issue?

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.743
Good afternoon, love.
Spare a couple of minutes?

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:02.580
I'd love to tell you a bit about
this charity we've got going on.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.290
Um, I'm not interested.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:05.807
No? No problem.

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:37.531
Can I help you?

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:39.631
- May I sit down?
- Yeah, please do.

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:43.496
- Is there somewhere you have in mind?
- No, I...

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:46.457
I want to know if a man
has been in here.

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:48.292
It's my husband.

01:09:48.392 --> 01:09:51.504
We've used you a few times
and I wondered if he'd been in.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:54.772
Um, was he enquiring about Switzerland?

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.686
- Been a long time.
- Yeah, sorry.

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.188
I've been...

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:35.915
Well, town was very busy
and the bus back was... Sorry.

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:40.112
I went to the travel agent today.

01:11:40.212 --> 01:11:43.214
- What?
- I went to the travel agent.

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:46.801
Are you going to Switzerland?

01:11:50.055 --> 01:11:52.249
- No. I'm not.
- Why not?

01:11:52.349 --> 01:11:56.086
Well, I can't walk to the village
without... without sitting down.

01:11:56.186 --> 01:11:58.297
How am I going to climb
a fucking mountain?

01:11:58.397 --> 01:11:59.715
And that's the reason?

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.342
No, Kate, that's not the reason.

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:03.302
Because if you do go, and if I...

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.971
Oh, Christ, Kate.
This isn't about Katya.

01:12:06.071 --> 01:12:08.140
Please, stop saying her name.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.726
- I can't bear it.
- It isn't... It isn't about Katya.

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:11.977
It is.

01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:14.162
Of course it is.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.816
Like me discovering
what this smell is around the house.

01:12:17.916 --> 01:12:20.361
- Oh, please.
- And it's her perfume, OK?

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:24.448
It's like she's been standing
in the corner of the room all this time,

01:12:24.548 --> 01:12:26.632
- behind my back.
- Oh, come on.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.913
And it's tainted everything.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:34.667
All our decisions, where we go
on holiday, what books we read,

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:37.894
what dog you want to choose,
what music we want to listen to.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.339
And the big things, too.

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:42.523
Especially the big things.

01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:46.569
She's had nothing to do
with any of that.

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:53.868
I'd like to be able to tell you
everything I'm... thinking,

01:12:55.287 --> 01:12:57.022
and everything I know,

01:12:57.122 --> 01:12:59.207
but I can't.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.709
Do you understand that?

01:13:02.586 --> 01:13:04.670
Yeah.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:06.881
Yes, I do.

01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:24.925
All I want now is for you
to just come to the party tomorrow.

01:13:25.025 --> 01:13:27.928
- Of course I'm going to come.
- I really need you to want to be there.

01:13:28.028 --> 01:13:29.987
Yes, I do want to be there.

01:13:30.447 --> 01:13:33.267
Because it's one thing me knowing
I haven't been enough for you.

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:35.451
It's something...

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:39.898
...altogether different
that everyone else feels it, too.

01:13:39.998 --> 01:13:42.776
You really believe
you haven't been enough for me?

01:13:42.876 --> 01:13:44.961
No. I think I was enough for you.

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:48.005
I'm just not sure you do.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:52.343
Ah, Kate.

01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:55.555
That's terrible.

01:13:58.225 --> 01:14:00.794
- Have you taken your pills today?
- No.

01:14:00.894 --> 01:14:03.339
Then I'm going to get them.

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:07.316
And then we're going to have dinner,
and then we're going to go to bed.

01:14:08.026 --> 01:14:10.111
And then we're going to get up.

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:13.698
And we'll try and start again.

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:16.701
OK, Kate, I can do that.

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:20.746
We can do that.

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:25.168
I promise.

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:46.090
Morning.

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:47.591
I made you some tea.

01:14:47.691 --> 01:14:49.176
- Oh.
- And, er...

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:52.904
I've managed to fix the lavatory
without cutting me finger off.

01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:56.767
Is it late?

01:14:56.867 --> 01:14:59.103
Yeah, I thought
I'd make us some scrambled eggs

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:01.287
and then we can take Max for a walk.

01:15:01.872 --> 01:15:03.232
Oh.

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.942
- Great.
- Right.

01:15:05.042 --> 01:15:07.126
Will do.

01:15:08.128 --> 01:15:10.338
Yeah, we have got some eggs, haven't we?

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:37.057
I saw a treecreeper here,
once, a lovely little bird.

01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:42.563
Somebody told me that they fly down to the
bottom of the tree and work their way up.

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:47.542
And nuthatches, they fly to the top of
the trunk, work their way down.

01:15:47.751 --> 01:15:49.835
Come on. Come on. Good boy.

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:53.157
- You used to love your birdwatching.
- I did, yes.

01:15:53.257 --> 01:15:56.467
It's funny how you forget
the things in life that make you happy.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.637
Stay there, Max.

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:25.705
Found it, Max.

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:58.485
Again, I'm sorry
I didn't get you anything.

01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:00.669
Oh, don't be silly.

01:20:00.837 --> 01:20:02.197
This is very beautiful.

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:04.381
I'm glad you like it.

01:20:05.383 --> 01:20:07.119
I was going to get you a watch.

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:12.096
I was thinking of having it engraved,
but I wasn't sure what to write.

01:20:12.432 --> 01:20:14.517
I like not knowing the time.

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.879
- I just couldn't do it.
- No.

01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:02.565
- Don't worry, darling, you don't have to.
- Most people don't want to.

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:41.463
Will you come with me?
I've got something to show you.

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:44.790
No surprises, Lena.
I don't want a surprise.

01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:50.764
- Wow.
- Isn't it wonderful?

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:52.891
Look at this. Yes.

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:55.868
- Lena, what's that?
- Ah, come and have a look.

01:21:58.538 --> 01:21:59.981
Wow.

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:02.166
Photos.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.570
- Where did they all come from?
- I rang round. Everyone contributed.

01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:07.113
Most of them are mine.

01:22:07.213 --> 01:22:09.574
Look, Kate, look how beautiful you are.

01:22:09.674 --> 01:22:13.328
Kate, there's Tessa
when she was a puppy.

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:17.165
Ah, there's me... me
and me goggles, strimming.

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:18.375
Strimming.

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:20.794
- Look at us there. Remember that?
- Egypt.

01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:22.254
Yeah, when we went to Egypt.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:24.381
Gorgeous, we both are.

01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:26.967
Lena, this is wonderful. Thank you.

01:22:27.067 --> 01:22:28.760
Not bad for an old fascist, huh?

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:30.945
Yeah, not bad at all.

01:22:31.696 --> 01:22:34.474
- Oh, I can't wait to hear your speech.
- Yeah, it's all in here.

01:22:34.574 --> 01:22:37.618
- Ugh, we're all in trouble then.
- Yeah, especially you.

01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:39.312
Just you wait for those tears.

01:22:39.412 --> 01:22:41.398
- Who's that?
- That's Arthur, I think.

01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:42.691
- Yes, it is.
- Yes.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:46.251
- Yeah, it's Arthur, a few years ago.
- And who else do I see?

01:23:12.028 --> 01:23:17.116
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've all been waiting for.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:20.619
I give you... Mr Geoffrey Mercer.

01:23:20.745 --> 01:23:22.736
Go on, Geoffrey.

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:29.779
Now, can you hear me?

01:23:29.879 --> 01:23:31.964
- We can hear you.
- Yes.

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:34.409
Oh, dear.

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.870
I'd better try and make sense, then.

01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:42.349
Well, I'd like to thank you all,
first off, for being here this evening.

01:23:42.559 --> 01:23:47.464
Some of you may recall
that, er... my bypass,

01:23:47.564 --> 01:23:53.318
er, upstaged things a few years ago,
so, anyway, there we are.

01:23:55.238 --> 01:23:59.017
Now, er, I'm not used to
making this kind of speech

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:01.811
on this, er... sort of occasion,

01:24:01.911 --> 01:24:04.371
but, er... well...

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:07.666
I'll give it me best shot.

01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:12.421
As, um, as we get older,

01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:17.953
we seem to stop, er, making choices.

01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:20.163
Big ones, anyway.

01:24:20.263 --> 01:24:23.375
Perhaps we only get so many,
er, in a lifetime,

01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:27.561
and once we've used them up,
they're gone.

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:33.969
Or maybe our brains, they just
get a bit, er, old and arthritic,

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:37.287
like, er... like George's knee.

01:24:38.281 --> 01:24:40.240
Er, whatever.

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:47.607
The upshot is that the choices we make
when we're young

01:24:47.707 --> 01:24:51.627
are pretty bloody important.

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:58.092
Er, like the choice, er,
Kate and me made

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:02.262
45 years ago... today.

01:25:03.973 --> 01:25:06.058
Today.

01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:15.609
Now, things... things
haven't always been, er... idyllic.

01:25:16.569 --> 01:25:21.683
Er, like all couples, we've had
our downs as, er... as well as our ups.

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:24.910
We all, we all, er, think...

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.622
We all wish we'd done some things,
er, differently,

01:25:28.915 --> 01:25:32.668
wish we hadn't made certain mistakes,

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:36.964
but, er... whatever.

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:41.844
I have to say, and I need to say,

01:25:43.054 --> 01:25:49.794
that persuading you,
er, to marry me, Kate,

01:25:49.894 --> 01:25:52.479
was the best thing I've ever done.

01:25:53.064 --> 01:25:55.717
Er, it took some doing, by the way.

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:58.386
Yeah, so your father,
I don't think he was convinced

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:00.571
I was the greatest catch in the world.

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:03.558
I wonder why that was.

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:07.187
But anyway, er,
persuading you to marry me

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:11.066
was the best thing I've ever done,

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:15.737
and, er, I'm sorry, I truly am,

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:20.867
that, er, you haven't, er...
you haven't always known that

01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:24.329
because, er, well, for me, Kate,

01:26:24.429 --> 01:26:29.918
this is, er, this is what it's... what
it's all about, what all this is about,

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:33.588
why all... why all our friends
are here this evening.

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:37.232
It's about, er... it's about you and me.

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.970
You and me, Kate.

01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:42.889
Us.

01:26:42.989 --> 01:26:44.682
Yeah.

01:26:44.782 --> 01:26:48.561
And I think, really,
that's about all I've, er... got to say,

01:26:48.661 --> 01:26:51.747
except that, er... I love you.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:55.292
Aw.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:26:59.572
I love you very much.

01:26:59.672 --> 01:27:03.910
And thank you for standing by me
through all these years

01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:08.680
and putting up with all my nonsense,
and, er... long may it continue.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.549
Geoff and Kate!

01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:19.733
Geoff and Kate!

01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:30.687
It was fantastic. Wasn't it?

01:27:30.787 --> 01:27:32.871
It was.

01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:55.086
And now...

01:27:55.186 --> 01:27:59.757
would the two lovebirds kindly
take to the floor for the first dance?

01:27:59.857 --> 01:28:00.967
Aw.

01:28:01.067 --> 01:28:05.221
And for those of you that don't know,
or weren't alive,

01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:10.560
this is the very same song
that was played 45 years ago today.

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.395
Aw.

01:28:12.495 --> 01:28:15.778
I give you Mr and Mrs Mercer.

01:28:16.305 --> 01:28:22.785
