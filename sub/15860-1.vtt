we brought you up here?

To the first place.

44:50.438 --> 44:51.781
It was '86.

Yes. Because Kyle was
going to be a senior.

I was 10.
Yes.

before you got diagnosed?

I just want to know
how it all started.

Before you had to leave.

49:17.371 --> 49:19.465

are variable.

to your house.

borrow some
equipment from work.

Hello.

51:55.613 --> 51:57.035

I'm Kendra.

51:57.114 --> 51:58.206
Curtis.

51:58.365 --> 51:59.366
Okay.

52:00.993 --> 52:03.462
I'm gonna start by asking
you some questions.

52:03.537 --> 52:07.041
Okay. I already answered all
the questions on the form.

52:07.374 --> 52:08.466
Yeah, I know.
I looked at them,

52:08.542 --> 52:11.546
but I need to get
a profile started on you.

52:11.629 --> 52:13.552
Right. Well...

52:16.800 --> 52:19.349
Out of the five
possible symptoms

52:19.428 --> 52:21.351
needed to be diagnosed
with schizophrenia,

52:21.764 --> 52:24.984
delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized speech,

52:25.059 --> 52:28.689
disorganized behavior
and the negative symptoms,

52:30.397 --> 52:32.024
I've had two.

52:33.400 --> 52:35.528
Delusions and hallucinations.

52:36.153 --> 52:40.579
So, I took this quiz
in the back of the book.

52:40.658 --> 52:45.004
I scored a five
out of a possible 20.

52:45.454 --> 52:48.082
Schizophrenia starts
at 12. So...

52:50.584 --> 52:53.838
They say it might be
a brief psychotic disorder.

52:56.382 --> 52:59.101
Yeah. Whatever it is,
I need to know what to do

53:00.135 --> 53:01.182
or what to get on

53:01.261 --> 53:03.309
to get this thing
under control.

53:06.892 --> 53:08.815
Look. I'm a counselor.

53:09.561 --> 53:11.984
Certified,
but I'm not a psychiatrist.

53:12.064 --> 53:13.566
I can't prescribe
anything to you.

53:13.649 --> 53:17.529
I can talk to you, I can
recommend where to send you,

53:17.611 --> 53:19.113
but that's it.

53:21.782 --> 53:26.834
Now, that said, if you
want to talk, I'll listen.

53:28.747 --> 53:31.421
For a lot of people,
that's a good start.

53:32.668 --> 53:35.217
Now you said here

53:35.295 --> 53:36.638
that your mother was diagnosed

53:36.714 --> 53:39.467
with paranoid schizophrenia
in her 30s.

53:39.550 --> 53:40.972
And you're at 35.

53:42.302 --> 53:44.475
You wanna talk about that?

53:49.017 --> 53:51.816
Yeah, I don't know
my mother's symptoms.

53:53.105 --> 53:54.607
I was just 10.

53:55.899 --> 53:58.652
My brother was 17. And...

54:02.406 --> 54:05.159
I don't know. She just
left me in the car

54:06.160 --> 54:09.289
in the parking lot
at the grocery store one day.

54:11.165 --> 54:13.088
And she didn't come back.

54:17.963 --> 54:19.431
And then they
found her a week later

54:19.506 --> 54:20.928
eating trash out of a dumpster

54:21.008 --> 54:22.851
in Northern Kentucky.

54:24.052 --> 54:27.807
My dad had to put her in the
State Hospital in Columbus.

54:29.516 --> 54:32.690
And she's been in
assisted living ever since.

54:37.399 --> 54:38.491
Yep.

54:39.777 --> 54:41.495
My dad raised me.

54:43.363 --> 54:45.161

our schedule will be, but...

55:11.225 --> 55:12.317

continue with the sign language.

you owe me that?

might respect me enough

what I'd have to say?

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:04.192
I didn't want you
worrying about it.

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.682
There's nothing to explain.

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:24.351
I'm gonna go put Hannah to bed.

an ambulance!

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:43.844
My husband's having a seizure.

He's bleeding!

(GURGLING)

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:53.691

Honey? Are you okay?

01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:30.607
You were having a seizure.
I called an ambulance.

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:32.229
(GRUNTS)

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:37.401
No. It's fine. It's fine.
Don't send an ambulance.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.733

It's fine.

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:03.802
I'm sorry you fellows had
to come all the way out.

01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:05.384
It's what we do.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:06.593
Now we can still take you in

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.428
if you want a doctor to look
at those cuts in your mouth.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:11.435
Yeah, that's all right.
I'll see somebody on Monday.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:12.811
All right.

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:14.772

01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:03.779

with you.

01:05:07.278 --> 01:05:08.575
I'm sorry.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:13.584
What's going on?

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:21.130
I've been having these dreams.

01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:27.632
I guess they're
more like nightmares.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.845
It's why I've been
acting like this.

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:35.519
They, um...

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:40.771
They always start
with a kind of storm.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:46.694
Like a real powerful storm.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:48.870
And there's always this, uh...

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.578
This dark, thick rain.

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:55.247
Like fresh motor oil.

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:00.670
And then

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:03.092
the things,

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.930
people, it just
makes them crazy.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:11.226
They attack me.
Sometimes...

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:16.898
Sometimes they go after Hannah.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.235
First one I had,

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:24.197
Red nearly
chewed through my arm.

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:28.735
That's why you
put him out back?

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:30.828
Yeah.

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:42.257
What was the dream?
Tonight.

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:51.049
It was Dewart.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.432
We were at the job site.

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:59.849
The storm started
and something happened.

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:01.401
His face...

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:06.231
His eyes were

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.326
different.

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.489
He came after me with a pickax.

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:16.124
And we fought.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:20.207
And he ran it through my leg.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:31.136
(STUTTERING)
It's hard to explain,

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:36.599
because it's not just a dream.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.108
It's a feeling.

01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:51.322
I'm afraid

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:54.120
something might be coming.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.665
Something that's

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:00.494
not right.

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:07.167
I cannot describe it.

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:10.177
I just need you to believe me.

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:16.850
I've been to a counselor.

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:20.354
I've seen her...

01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:23.520
I've seen her a few times.

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:29.443
You know what I come from.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:36.412
And I promised myself...

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:46.163
I promised myself
I would never leave.

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:58.639
And I am doing
everything that I can

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:02.889
to make that true.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.542
Okay, since the doctor's
approved her surgery,

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:34.049
we just need to
get her scheduled.

01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:38.759
The next possible opening
is the 21st of next month.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.184
That's six weeks.

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:41.305
Six weeks?

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:42.386
Is that okay?

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.937
It's wonderful.

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:54.782
This point just to the west.

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.029
I don't think
we'll have any problem.

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:58.737
We should be able to get 20,
maybe 30 in this next week.

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:02.116
But we're looking to see how
that's gonna shape up, so...

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:04.834
Curtis?
Yeah.

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:06.794
What do you think?

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:08.291
Yeah. That sounds good.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.832
We'll get it done.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:22.264
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:23.845
Come in.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.898
What you need, Curtis?

01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:32.774
I need a favor, Jim.

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:33.980
What's that?

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:36.486
Can you take Dewart
off my crew?

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:38.989
Just reassign him
someplace else.

01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:46.830
What's the trouble?
He not pulling his weight?

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:50.004
No, nothing like that.
He's a good worker.

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:52.207
He's a good man.
He's my friend.

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:56.090
I think it'd be easier

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:58.672
not being in charge of
someone I'm so close to.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:01.803
You know, I understand.

01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:06.934
This is part of what it means
to manage people, Curtis.

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:08.435
You're gonna
have to learn that.

01:11:09.307 --> 01:11:11.776
Yes, sir.
I appreciate that, but...

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:16.148
Well, it would just be
very helpful in this case.

01:11:17.315 --> 01:11:18.362
Okay.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.907
Well, I can
put him with Russell.

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:23.283
Anybody else you'd prefer?

01:11:23.362 --> 01:11:25.706
No. Whoever
you think's right.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.993
Okay. Okay.

01:11:30.077 --> 01:11:31.374
Thank you.

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:35.337
You been missing
a lot of work, Curtis.

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:39.132
I know. My daughter's had
a lot of doctor's visits.

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:40.384
I haven't let
anything get behind.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.553
No. But don't. Okay?

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.551
Yes, sir.

01:11:58.356 --> 01:12:01.109
SAMANTHA: I know they just
usually do oysters and fries,

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:04.116
but what if we did something
healthier on the side?

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:06.913
What, like 'slaw?

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:10.247
I don't know.
Maybe a vegetable or salad.

01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:22.635
Dewart's been telling me how strange
Curtis has been acting lately.

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:25.804
I am so sorry.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.011
It's not like
you don't have enough

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:31.189
on your plate with Hannah.

01:12:31.264 --> 01:12:32.686
Things are fine.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.025
We're fine.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:53.961
Can I help you?

01:12:54.662 --> 01:12:55.959
Yeah.

01:12:58.457 --> 01:12:59.925
Can I look at one
of these gas masks?

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:01.298
Sure.

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:02.795
Which one you want to look at?

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:04.631
The newest one.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.972
How much?
$178.

01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:15.312
Anything cheaper?

01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:18.694
No. That's the cheapest
one I got in the store.

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:21.527
They go all the way up to $290.

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:25.322
I don't know what
you want to spend,

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:27.779
but a gas mask ain't something
you want to go cheap on.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:30.998
You got any kids' sizes?

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:32.499
No.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.702
Kids can't wear those.

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:37.504
They gotta have a special
thing, it's like a hood.

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:40.416
I don't fool with those.

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.533
What the hell are you doing?

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:19.504
What you got going on here?

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:25.883
I'm just adding on
to the storm shelter.

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:29.344
Why?
Just because.

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:33.678
You running water to it?

01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:35.889
Oh, yeah.
From our well.

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:38.979
Running sewer out
to the city line.

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.565
How much you spending
on this thing?

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:43.646
It's not bad.

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:44.901
Doesn't look it.

01:14:48.776 --> 01:14:50.824
You take your eye off the ball
one minute in this economy

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:52.576
and you're screwed.

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:54.573
You got the cash for this?

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:55.749
Yeah.

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:00.330
Don't put nothing on credit cards.
That shit'll eat you up.

01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:01.585
I'm not.

01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:11.970
Samantha called me.

01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:14.678
I figured.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.189
Called you to
come tell me to quit?

01:15:19.265 --> 01:15:21.267
She called
'cause she's worried.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.523
Says you've been stressed out.

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:28.449
So?
So what?

01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:30.860
You stressed out?

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:35.331
No. No more
than anybody else.

01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:38.542
Work all right?

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:41.583
Uh-huh.

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:45.132
Hey, look.
You wanna come by

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:46.550
and have dinner sometime, Kyle?
That's fine.

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:48.502
We'll have a beer and
talk about the old days,

01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:49.587
but you got something
to say, just say it.

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.297
You can stop
that shit right now.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.597
I'll come over there
and remind you

01:15:52.673 --> 01:15:55.426
what it's like to
get your ass whipped.

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:00.640
I'm just coming here
to check on you.

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:02.817
Well, I appreciate it, Kyle.

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:13.160
You been to see Mom?

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:15.537
Yeah.
A few days ago.

01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:19.917
She all right?

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:23.295
You should see her.

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:25.589
Take your girls.

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:28.839
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll get around to it.

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:31.004
Mmm-hmm.

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:40.391
You need a hand?
No. I've got it.

01:16:43.057 --> 01:16:44.183
Okay.

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:47.945
Call me if you need me, okay?

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.237
I will.

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:53.571
Oh, hey, Kyle?

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:58.034
Actually,
you could do me a favor.

01:16:58.239 --> 01:16:59.286
What's that?

(BREATHING)

01:43:28.369 --> 01:43:30.121
It's still storming.

01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:33.083
No. It's not.

01:43:36.085 --> 01:43:37.632
I can hear it.

01:43:39.630 --> 01:43:41.553
(WHISPERING) I don't
hear anything.

01:43:48.681 --> 01:43:51.935
Put your hand on the door.
You can feel it.

01:44:33.309 --> 01:44:35.607
Thunder?
Do you feel it?

01:44:41.192 --> 01:44:42.318
You feel it?

01:44:43.027 --> 01:44:44.119
You feel it?

01:44:44.528 --> 01:44:46.405
(CURTIS PANTING NERVOUSLY)

01:45:09.512 --> 01:45:10.980
I'm sorry.

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:18.566
Baby, there's no storm outside.

01:45:26.904 --> 01:45:28.326
I'm sorry.

01:45:31.075 --> 01:45:33.248
Curtis, I wouldn't lie to you.

01:45:36.413 --> 01:45:38.211
We love you very much.

01:45:43.003 --> 01:45:44.596
Please

01:45:47.925 --> 01:45:49.427
open the door.

01:45:52.930 --> 01:45:54.227
I'm sorry.

01:45:58.143 --> 01:45:59.440
I can't.

01:46:19.123 --> 01:46:20.716
I love you,
but if I open the door,

01:46:20.791 --> 01:46:23.214
then nothing's gonna change.

01:46:24.962 --> 01:46:26.760
You'll see that
everything's fine,

01:46:27.298 --> 01:46:29.300
but nothing will change.

01:46:31.176 --> 01:46:32.428
Please.

01:46:34.847 --> 01:46:37.521
This is what it means
to stay with us.

01:46:45.608 --> 01:46:48.077
This is something
you have to do.

01:46:51.155 --> 01:46:52.407
(EXHALES)

01:47:56.762 --> 01:47:58.890
Could you move Hannah back?

(GROANS SOFTLY)

01:50:15.901 --> 01:50:17.198
It's fine.

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:03.574
MAN: Do you have any vacation
time that you can use?

01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:08.712
I don't have a job right now.

01:51:11.415 --> 01:51:13.258
Well, I know
that times are hard,

01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:16.963
but I think it's really important
for you to separate yourself

01:51:17.045 --> 01:51:18.638
from that storm shelter.

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:21.763
I think you need to break
away from it for a while.

01:51:21.842 --> 01:51:24.061
We can start you on some
medication that I think will help,

01:51:24.136 --> 01:51:26.810
but that action alone
would mean a lot.

01:51:26.889 --> 01:51:30.268
We usually go on a trip
to Myrtle Beach each summer.

01:51:31.685 --> 01:51:33.562
We were gonna go this month.

01:51:34.688 --> 01:51:36.782
I think that would be okay

01:51:37.316 --> 01:51:39.944
if we start the medication now.

01:51:41.236 --> 01:51:43.330
And it would give you all some
time to prepare as a family.

01:51:43.405 --> 01:51:45.499
But I want to be clear,

01:51:45.574 --> 01:51:48.293
when Curtis gets back, he'll need
to take more time than that.

01:51:49.328 --> 01:51:50.955
What does that mean?

01:51:52.372 --> 01:51:56.172
I mean that he'll need hands-on
therapy at a real facility.

01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:03.843
You mean I have
to leave my family?

01:52:08.472 --> 01:52:11.817
I think you need to seriously
commit to some treatment.

Okay.

(EXCLAIMS IN JOY)

01:53:23.755 --> 01:53:24.972
There we go.

01:53:26.133 --> 01:53:27.305
Let's make a river.

01:53:34.558 --> 01:53:36.435
Good. Yeah.

01:53:39.313 --> 01:53:41.111
We put a top on it.

01:53:47.988 --> 01:53:49.035
What is it, honey?

01:53:54.995 --> 01:53:56.087
