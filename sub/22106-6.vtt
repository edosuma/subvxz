WEBVTT

00:10.347 --> 00:11.948
Okay.

00:11.949 --> 00:14.551
My turn.

00:14.552 --> 00:16.886
I did magic tricks
at kids parties

00:16.887 --> 00:18.188
when I was in high school.

00:18.189 --> 00:19.389
Mmhmm.

00:19.390 --> 00:22.025
I had my appendix removed
when I was ten years old.

00:22.026 --> 00:23.726
Mmhmm.

00:23.727 --> 00:25.462
And I have an irrational fear
of fish.

00:26.630 --> 00:27.531
Okay.

00:27.532 --> 00:29.365
Well, um...

00:29.366 --> 00:31.134
Swimming with fish
or eating them?

00:31.135 --> 00:32.668
I can eat fish.

00:32.670 --> 00:33.737
Some fish.

00:34.471 --> 00:35.471
I can eat fish sticks.

00:36.373 --> 00:37.774
But yeah, being in the
water with them.

00:37.775 --> 00:38.342
All right, sharks?

00:38.342 --> 00:39.243
Or even guppies?

00:39.244 --> 00:40.810
Um.

00:40.811 --> 00:42.779
Tiny school of guppies
or a shark doesn't matter.

00:42.780 --> 00:43.914
I'm freaked.

00:44.515 --> 00:45.416
What?

00:45.417 --> 00:47.217
You're a fish coward.

00:47.218 --> 00:49.152
Well, maybe not.

00:49.153 --> 00:51.588
One of them's a lie.

00:51.589 --> 00:52.589
Right.

00:52.590 --> 00:54.123
Okay, give them to me again.

00:54.124 --> 00:55.492
Magician.

00:55.859 --> 00:57.327
Appendix.

00:57.328 --> 00:58.596
Fear of fish.

01:02.132 --> 01:03.499
Magician.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.667
Are you sure?

01:04.668 --> 01:05.668
Yeah.

01:05.669 --> 01:07.570
Fish is too specific
to be untrue.

01:07.571 --> 01:09.239
Seen your appendectomy scar,

01:09.240 --> 01:12.208
and you don't have the stage
presence to be a magician.

01:12.209 --> 01:13.943
Wha...?

01:13.944 --> 01:18.214
I am gonna choose not
to be offended by that.

01:18.215 --> 01:21.284
I guess you can read me like
a book Miss Abbington.

01:21.285 --> 01:25.222
Yes I can.

01:30.628 --> 01:31.562
There will be a
sentry posted outside the camp

01:31.563 --> 01:33.563
so we should approach
from the north.

01:33.564 --> 01:34.931
I say we wait till nightfall.

01:34.932 --> 01:39.669
I'll go in alone, see if I
can't... get... Lynn out myself.

01:39.670 --> 01:41.137
If you don't like the plan,
just say so.

01:41.138 --> 01:42.772
Get on your knees.

01:42.773 --> 01:43.607
What is this?

01:43.608 --> 01:46.175
This is you gettin'
on your knees!

01:46.176 --> 01:49.280
All right.

01:50.214 --> 01:54.617
Tie your wrists.

01:54.618 --> 01:58.054
You set this up before you
came back for me?

01:58.055 --> 02:00.423
I needed to see what you
would do once you were free.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.591
And I failed?

02:01.592 --> 02:02.992
Just being cautious.

02:02.993 --> 02:04.827
And you should be.

02:04.828 --> 02:06.062
But it's me.

02:06.063 --> 02:07.530
Then you won't mind
doing what I ask!

02:07.531 --> 02:08.965
Yeah, I mind.

02:08.966 --> 02:11.768
I can't help you rescue Lynn
if my hands are tied.

02:11.769 --> 02:14.070
And we're about to walk into a
camp filled with Skin Riders,

02:14.071 --> 02:16.005
of which I am one.

02:16.006 --> 02:19.275
So how do you think that they
are going to respond to this?

02:19.276 --> 02:25.915
You have three seconds!

02:25.916 --> 02:27.083
I can't tie my own wrists.

02:27.084 --> 02:28.451
It's physically impossible.

02:28.452 --> 02:33.456
Use your teeth.

02:33.457 --> 02:34.991
I um...

02:34.992 --> 02:38.095
I really thought we were past
all this.

02:46.570 --> 02:50.874
Am I still tying my wrists?

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.147 --> 03:32.315
Ezra and Feena
shouldn't have gone.

03:32.316 --> 03:33.883
They don't know where
the Skin Riders live,

03:33.884 --> 03:37.587
or... how many they'll
find once they get there.

03:37.588 --> 03:39.155
Ezra was determined.

03:39.156 --> 03:41.758
There was no dissuading him.

03:41.759 --> 03:44.660
The man loves his wife.

03:44.661 --> 03:46.195
I can't fault him for that.

03:46.196 --> 03:49.265
What will you do if he and
Feena do not return?

03:49.266 --> 03:51.634
I can't restart the human
race by myself.

03:51.635 --> 03:53.369
That would require

03:53.370 --> 03:54.804
at least one
fertile female mate.

03:54.805 --> 03:55.972
Yeah.

03:55.973 --> 03:57.306
I get the biology.

03:57.307 --> 04:01.377
You promised the Obelisk to
find and destroy the Ancestor.

04:01.378 --> 04:02.812
Any idea where it's located?

04:02.813 --> 04:03.980
Negative.

04:03.981 --> 04:07.751
That is one secret
the Skin Riders have kept well.

06:03.901 --> 06:08.938
Ancestors, may I approach?

06:08.939 --> 06:10.173
Come.

06:13.510 --> 06:17.179
You thought you
could sneak in and overpower u.

06:17.180 --> 06:19.282
With this?

06:19.283 --> 06:21.617
Or maybe you came to join us.

06:21.618 --> 06:23.386
To live alongside your wife.

06:23.387 --> 06:24.787
Where is she?

06:24.788 --> 06:26.255
In that ship.

06:26.256 --> 06:30.260
Resting while her body
accepts her Companion.

06:31.228 --> 06:32.762
You think you're so right, Ezra.

06:32.763 --> 06:34.063
But what have Skin Riders
done that humans

06:34.064 --> 06:36.599
haven't already done
to themselves?

06:36.600 --> 06:38.968
Look at our Community!

06:38.969 --> 06:40.636
Do you see disharmony here?

06:40.637 --> 06:41.938
Hatred?

06:41.939 --> 06:43.406
Everyone builds here.

06:43.407 --> 06:47.376
Everyone shares,
everyone contributes.

06:47.377 --> 06:48.778
Where's the crime?

06:48.779 --> 06:49.746
Where's the disunity?

06:49.747 --> 06:52.214
Where's the freedom?

06:52.215 --> 06:56.652
Will you let them?

06:56.653 --> 06:58.754
No one wants to leave.

06:58.755 --> 07:00.890
And Lynn?

07:00.891 --> 07:05.095
Does she want a Companion?

08:53.336 --> 08:55.805
Nobody's gonna fall for this.

08:55.806 --> 08:57.740
Well, then we do my plan.

08:57.741 --> 08:58.941
You're not going
into camp alone.

08:58.942 --> 09:00.476
No one would give me
a second look.

09:00.477 --> 09:01.111
Let's go.

09:01.112 --> 09:03.079
And what about him?

09:03.080 --> 09:04.346
He wakes up,

09:04.347 --> 09:09.318
he'll use his Companion to send
a message and alert the others.

09:09.319 --> 09:13.556
We're not killing him.

09:13.557 --> 09:15.524
Human in him would thank us.

09:15.525 --> 09:17.393
Be a mercy.

09:17.394 --> 09:18.095
I mean...

09:18.096 --> 09:19.628
I don't like it either, but...

09:19.629 --> 09:22.131
No!

09:22.132 --> 09:26.469
And when I ask for it?!

09:26.470 --> 09:27.837
Don't even talk like that!

09:27.838 --> 09:30.806
You don't understand, Feena.

09:30.807 --> 09:32.742
This Companion lulls
us chemically.

09:32.743 --> 09:35.077
It deadens us.

09:35.078 --> 09:35.912
Okay?

09:35.912 --> 09:36.847
It gives us just enough
of ourselves

09:36.848 --> 09:38.647
to make us think that
we are in control,

09:38.648 --> 09:40.750
but we're not.

09:40.751 --> 09:44.353
Now my Companion is
only partially healed.

09:44.354 --> 09:46.088
It will get stronger.

09:46.089 --> 09:48.023
And I need you to promise me

09:48.024 --> 09:53.963
that you will not let
it take me again.

09:53.964 --> 09:58.033
Please.

09:58.034 --> 10:00.436
Okay.

10:00.437 --> 10:01.738
Kay.

10:35.438 --> 10:36.639
Search the woods!

10:36.640 --> 10:39.441
She couldn't have gone far.

10:39.442 --> 10:40.543
Problems?

10:40.544 --> 10:45.415
Lynn has run off!

10:47.751 --> 10:49.652
Every brother and sister
within range of my voice

10:49.653 --> 10:52.188
will be looking for her now.

10:52.189 --> 10:54.356
We'll find her.

10:54.357 --> 10:56.192
And even if we don't,

10:56.193 --> 10:58.127
when her Companion
fully develops,

10:58.128 --> 11:02.064
she'll come back to us.

11:02.065 --> 11:04.367
Bring him!

11:18.415 --> 11:19.582
Lynn's escaped.

11:19.583 --> 11:22.618
Silas sent Skin Riders
into the woods to find her.

11:22.619 --> 11:24.053
And Ezra?

11:24.054 --> 11:26.355
Is taken.

11:26.356 --> 11:27.190
I know...

11:27.190 --> 11:28.024
If you would
have stayed with him,

11:28.025 --> 11:29.391
you would have been taken too.

11:29.392 --> 11:30.593
We need to find Lynn before
they do.

11:30.594 --> 11:31.794
No.

11:31.795 --> 11:33.462
We need to clear out
before they find you, okay?

11:33.463 --> 11:35.297
It is too dangerous now, Feena.

11:35.298 --> 11:36.765
They are out here.

11:36.766 --> 11:39.401
I need to get you back
to the Settlement.

11:39.402 --> 11:42.805
Can you send
the Skin Riders a message?

11:42.806 --> 11:44.373
Saying what?

11:44.374 --> 11:45.741
That you spotted Lynn.

11:45.742 --> 11:47.476
Give them a location and then,

11:47.477 --> 11:50.346
send them in the
wrong direction.

11:50.347 --> 11:51.647
Jax will be out of range by now,

11:51.648 --> 11:53.949
but everyone else should hear.

11:53.950 --> 11:55.050
Now...

11:55.051 --> 11:56.852
There's a gully two miles away.

11:56.853 --> 11:58.153
I'll send them there.

11:58.154 --> 12:00.089
And if that's where
she actually is?

12:00.090 --> 12:01.824
We're sending them straight
to her.

12:01.825 --> 12:03.626
And if she's spotted
along the way,

12:03.627 --> 12:06.228
then they know I'm lying.

12:06.229 --> 12:07.496
We take those risks!

12:07.497 --> 12:09.365
We won't reach camp otherwise.

12:09.366 --> 12:11.033
So we're rescuing Ezra?

12:11.034 --> 12:12.534
There's fewer of them at camp.

12:12.535 --> 12:15.137
This is the best chance
we're going to get.

12:15.138 --> 12:17.507
I think my chances were
better tied to the tree.

12:34.357 --> 12:37.159
She's bound.

12:37.160 --> 12:40.930
Every exit is guarded.

12:40.931 --> 12:45.701
And yet, Lynn still finds a wa.

12:45.702 --> 12:48.938
Impressive.

12:48.939 --> 12:52.808
But then again, Lynn always was.

12:52.809 --> 13:00.749
Leave us.

13:00.750 --> 13:03.786
Our sanctuary!

13:03.787 --> 13:09.358
Where we counsel together
and honor our dead.

13:09.359 --> 13:10.559
It's not St. Paul's Cathedral,

13:10.560 --> 13:14.396
but it keeps the rain off.

13:14.397 --> 13:17.533
Karik warship,
from the invasion.

13:17.534 --> 13:19.001
The humans may have
lost the war,

13:19.002 --> 13:24.740
but we scored a few victories.

13:24.741 --> 13:27.576
You're conflicted right now.

13:27.577 --> 13:29.478
Part of you wants to go
out of here and find Lynn

13:29.479 --> 13:31.313
before we do.

13:31.314 --> 13:34.316
But you also don't want
to abandon your brother.

13:34.317 --> 13:36.452
You want to save me.

13:36.453 --> 13:38.654
I care about you, Silas.

13:38.655 --> 13:40.089
I want you healthy,

13:40.090 --> 13:42.291
and back with us
at the Settlement.

13:42.292 --> 13:44.426
I want our family
together again.

13:44.427 --> 13:46.695
You sound like someone
staging an intervention.

13:46.696 --> 13:48.697
Maybe I am!

13:48.698 --> 13:51.433
I belong to these people, Ezra.

13:51.434 --> 13:52.868
It may surprise you
to hear me say so,

13:52.869 --> 13:56.905
but I make a pretty good priest.

13:56.906 --> 13:58.240
Yeah, of something you don't
believe in...

13:58.241 --> 14:04.713
Once again,
you speak in ignorance.

14:04.714 --> 14:12.714
You don't know what a
Companion can provide.

14:12.822 --> 14:15.791
I feel pain.

14:15.792 --> 14:17.760
But the Companion
can counter that pain

14:17.761 --> 14:20.363
with peace and contentment.

14:37.814 --> 14:40.349
There you go again.

14:40.350 --> 14:46.088
Playing the protector.

14:46.089 --> 14:49.324
You can't see how dangerous
its influence is.

14:49.325 --> 14:50.392
It won't let you!

14:50.393 --> 14:51.960
How wonderful its influence is,

14:51.961 --> 14:53.296
you mean.

14:56.366 --> 14:57.633
You have Sparks.

14:57.634 --> 15:01.370
Enough to heal minor
wounds and illnesses.

15:01.371 --> 15:08.010
We'll have more
when we take yours.

15:08.011 --> 15:11.046
You're wondering why the Sparks
don't kill my Companion.

15:11.047 --> 15:13.682
The way they healed Abram.

15:13.683 --> 15:17.186
Because killing a
fullygrown Companion

15:17.187 --> 15:25.187
would violate everything
the Sparks stand for.

15:26.162 --> 15:30.365
If you want to kill
my companion, Ezra.

15:30.366 --> 15:32.168
You'll have to kill me.

15:44.614 --> 15:45.381
They all left.

15:45.382 --> 15:46.648
No.

15:46.649 --> 15:51.053
No, somebody stayed behind
with Silas in the ship.

15:51.054 --> 15:52.855
If I call it, we pull back.

15:52.856 --> 15:53.690
Not without Ezra!

15:53.691 --> 15:55.124
No, Feena.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.392
I need you to trust me, okay?

15:57.393 --> 15:59.162
I can't have them take you.

16:12.609 --> 16:14.443
You're early!

16:14.444 --> 16:18.347
What's wrong?

16:18.348 --> 16:20.215
I'm being transferred.

16:20.216 --> 16:21.416
To where?

16:21.417 --> 16:24.720
I don't know,
they're not telling me.

16:24.721 --> 16:25.721
Will they just put you
on a plane?

16:25.722 --> 16:29.191
Yeah, something like that.

16:29.192 --> 16:30.126
Kay, well when?

16:30.127 --> 16:35.531
Tonight.

16:35.532 --> 16:38.634
Okay well, you call me
when you get there.

16:38.635 --> 16:42.638
And wherever it is I'll come.

16:42.639 --> 16:47.209
No, they -
They asked me to go silent.

16:47.210 --> 16:48.744
So I... I shouldn't even be here.

16:48.745 --> 16:49.778
They can't just
make you disappear,

16:49.779 --> 16:50.547
you have a life.

16:50.548 --> 16:58.187
Yeah, but not a choice.

16:58.188 --> 17:00.923
If this isn't working,
you can just say so.

17:00.924 --> 17:03.258
No, hey!

17:03.259 --> 17:05.060
You think I'm lying to you?

17:05.060 --> 17:08.262
What am I supposed to think?

17:08.263 --> 17:09.199
Listen to me.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.334
Something is about to happen,
all right?

17:12.335 --> 17:14.368
I don't know what exactly,

17:14.369 --> 17:22.144
but I need you to trust me.

17:22.145 --> 17:24.179
Well?

17:24.180 --> 17:28.450
You call it, we pull back.

17:28.451 --> 17:30.987
Good.

18:14.831 --> 18:19.736
Teach me the
workings of this machine.

18:40.256 --> 18:41.556
Behold.

18:41.557 --> 18:45.695
Your Ancestors.

18:48.431 --> 18:49.431
Do you sleep in here?

18:49.432 --> 18:54.771
Most of us do, yeah.

18:58.241 --> 18:59.208
Lynn!

18:59.209 --> 19:00.375
It's you.

19:00.376 --> 19:01.743
It's me, Feena.

19:01.744 --> 19:02.911
Of course!

19:02.912 --> 19:04.146
Are you okay?

19:04.147 --> 19:05.747
It's all right,
he's with us now.

19:05.748 --> 19:06.915
Did they infect you?

19:06.916 --> 19:07.350
Yes.

19:07.351 --> 19:09.651
On the forearm.

19:09.652 --> 19:10.686
We need to hurry.

19:10.687 --> 19:12.054
I immersed the wound in Sparks.

19:12.055 --> 19:12.922
I think that helped.

19:12.922 --> 19:13.823
You have Sparks?

19:13.824 --> 19:15.057
Not as many as we need.

19:15.058 --> 19:16.258
Listen, there's a clearing
to the north.

19:16.259 --> 19:17.193
All right?

19:17.194 --> 19:18.727
If I'm not there with Ezra
in five minutes,

19:18.728 --> 19:19.728
you go to the Settlement.

19:19.729 --> 19:20.697
Ezra's here?

19:20.698 --> 19:22.664
Duncan will find him.

19:22.665 --> 19:24.266
Here.

19:24.267 --> 19:32.267
Save it for my husband.

19:40.016 --> 19:42.484
You come to me as humans.

19:42.485 --> 19:44.619
Our hosts were humans.

19:44.620 --> 19:48.290
Our knowledge of the drones
comes from them.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.092
I thought there would be more
of you.

19:50.093 --> 19:52.694
Few Ancestors have knowledge
of the drones.

19:52.695 --> 19:54.196
We are all there is.

19:54.197 --> 19:56.098
Can you teach me
to reprogram it?

19:56.099 --> 19:59.568
You wish to block the neural
pathways of the human mind?

19:59.569 --> 20:02.571
To give greater control
to our Companion.

20:02.572 --> 20:04.439
Such a thing has never
been attempted.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.776
We're aware of the risks.

20:07.777 --> 20:09.678
Very well.

20:09.679 --> 20:11.214
We will show you what we know.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.486
I find all these
personal belongings

20:17.487 --> 20:19.588
in the living quarters,

20:19.589 --> 20:22.824
and then you showed
me some of the graves outside.

20:22.825 --> 20:25.527
Now I have more questions
than answers.

20:25.528 --> 20:33.528
Ask away.

20:34.937 --> 20:40.675
You said there are 134
settlers buried out there.

20:40.676 --> 20:44.780
Some you can identify, some not.

20:44.781 --> 20:47.416
If the corpses DNA is not
in my database,

20:47.417 --> 20:49.551
they are unknowns to me.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.420
How many can you identify?

20:51.421 --> 20:54.256
Seventyfour.

20:54.257 --> 20:55.323
Okay.

20:55.324 --> 20:57.759
We know 74 of them.

20:57.760 --> 21:02.397
That leaves 60 graves
of unknowns.

21:02.398 --> 21:05.033
Fiftynine.

21:05.034 --> 21:08.003
Am I doing the math wrong here?

21:08.004 --> 21:12.908
A hundred and thirtyfour
graves minus 74 is 60.

21:12.909 --> 21:14.409
Your math is correct.

21:14.410 --> 21:17.212
But one of the graves
does not have a body.

21:17.213 --> 21:19.347
Wait.

21:19.348 --> 21:22.517
You're saying there is
an empty grave out there?

21:22.518 --> 21:24.653
There is no body in the grave.

21:24.654 --> 21:29.058
But it is not empty.

21:43.606 --> 21:51.606
Jax tells me you
dug up a weapon in the woods.

21:52.415 --> 21:54.850
Let me guess.

21:54.851 --> 21:57.786
The Obelisk made you do it?

21:57.787 --> 22:02.257
I'm not one for pointing out
glaring ironies, Ezra.

22:02.258 --> 22:05.761
But I'd say the pot is
calling the kettle black.

22:10.933 --> 22:17.372
You say my companion coerces me,
manipulates me, enslaves me.

22:17.373 --> 22:21.009
But isn't that what the
Obelisk does to you?

22:21.010 --> 22:22.944
Locking you in its forcefield.

22:22.945 --> 22:26.815
Making you comply.

22:26.816 --> 22:30.085
I've been there.

22:30.086 --> 22:31.753
You lived in the Settlement?

22:31.754 --> 22:33.188
We all did.

22:33.189 --> 22:34.723
For years.

22:34.724 --> 22:37.760
Including you.

22:40.263 --> 22:43.865
The Obelisk didn't reveal
that nugget of information?

22:43.866 --> 22:46.234
Shocker.

22:46.235 --> 22:50.272
You and I were in the
Settlement together?

22:50.273 --> 22:51.273
And Lynn.

22:51.274 --> 22:55.544
Kylie too.

22:55.545 --> 22:56.145
You're lying.

22:56.146 --> 22:59.781
Why would I?

22:59.782 --> 23:02.417
That's what I mean, Ezra.

23:02.418 --> 23:03.852
You're so convinced
you're right,

23:03.853 --> 23:10.191
but you don't know anything.

23:10.192 --> 23:11.060
Where's Lynn?

23:11.061 --> 23:15.464
Your message said
you had found her.

23:16.332 --> 23:17.933
Explain yourself.

23:17.934 --> 23:19.334
Ezra's coming with me.

23:19.335 --> 23:20.635
And going where?

23:20.636 --> 23:21.370
To the Settlement?

23:21.371 --> 23:23.305
You think they'll let you in?

23:23.306 --> 23:25.073
Doesn't matter.

23:25.074 --> 23:27.876
Wherever I go,
it'll be better than here.

23:27.877 --> 23:29.344
You'll never make it.

23:29.345 --> 23:30.713
I'll send a message
to the others.

23:31.814 --> 23:33.415
We'll make it.

23:33.416 --> 23:40.522
If I didn't think so,
I would'a killed you already.

23:40.523 --> 23:44.060
I have Lynn outside.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.463
Come with us.

23:48.464 --> 23:51.232
Whatever's going on here,
we can figure it out together.

23:51.233 --> 23:54.736
I've already figured it out,
Ezra.

23:54.737 --> 23:56.504
You're on the losing side.

23:56.505 --> 23:57.840
We need to move!

24:17.793 --> 24:18.893
Yeah, yeah, very sweet.

24:18.894 --> 24:20.562
Shall we?

24:20.563 --> 24:23.498
I know a shortcut
if you trust me.

24:23.499 --> 24:26.167
I do.

24:26.168 --> 24:27.969
You can't go back
the way you came.

24:27.970 --> 24:29.471
They'll catch you.

24:29.472 --> 24:31.873
Silas is already redirecting
them that way.

24:31.874 --> 24:36.879
All right, we follow you.

24:44.887 --> 24:52.887
Pretty far off the beaten
path with this one?

24:58.534 --> 25:01.737
Okay.

25:48.217 --> 25:51.453
Agent Duncan!

25:51.454 --> 25:55.091
Welcome!

26:06.602 --> 26:07.702
It's not opening!

26:07.703 --> 26:08.737
It's because of me.

26:08.738 --> 26:10.672
The Obelisk senses the parasite.

26:10.673 --> 26:15.210
Try stepping through.

26:15.211 --> 26:16.112
Feena.

26:16.113 --> 26:17.412
I'm not leaving Duncan.

26:17.413 --> 26:18.513
Please Feena.

26:18.514 --> 26:21.683
They're coming.

26:21.684 --> 26:23.885
What do we do?

26:23.886 --> 26:27.055
Tell the Obelisk we'll bring
Duncan in with his hands bound.

26:27.056 --> 26:28.223
Will that work?

26:28.224 --> 26:29.457
It's worth asking.

26:29.458 --> 26:30.692
I'm not sure
I can articulate that.

26:30.693 --> 26:33.061
But I'll try.

26:33.062 --> 26:34.096
Here they come!

26:36.799 --> 26:44.799
Tie his hands.

26:44.807 --> 26:46.107
This isn't going to work.

26:46.108 --> 26:47.342
Leave me.

26:47.343 --> 26:48.110
Ezra!

26:48.111 --> 26:49.511
You know what I miss?

26:49.512 --> 26:51.112
Cars.

26:51.113 --> 26:52.614
You can hop in a comfy seat,

26:52.615 --> 26:53.349
push the gas,

26:53.350 --> 26:55.216
and whoosh, off you go.

26:55.217 --> 26:57.352
All this running through the
woods is just not my thing.

26:57.353 --> 26:59.654
I'm sorry.

26:59.655 --> 27:00.656
No!

27:01.390 --> 27:02.158
Leave, Ezra.

27:02.159 --> 27:03.458
This isn't your fight.

27:03.459 --> 27:05.527
But it is.

27:05.528 --> 27:07.495
That's why
they brought him back.

27:07.496 --> 27:11.232
Isn't it, Ezra?

27:11.233 --> 27:12.735
Well, lets get on with it.

27:18.107 --> 27:19.575
This better work.

27:23.112 --> 27:25.446
There's no reason
for you to do this, Ezra.

27:25.447 --> 27:29.985
There are plenty of reasons.

27:52.474 --> 27:53.442
Good job.

27:53.442 --> 27:54.343
Wasn't me.

27:54.344 --> 27:56.177
It was the Obelisk.

27:56.178 --> 27:59.447
But, there's a condition.

27:59.448 --> 28:01.583
He stays locked up,
here in the courtyard.

28:01.584 --> 28:02.418
What?

28:02.419 --> 28:04.052
Until we figure out
a cure for him.

28:04.053 --> 28:05.386
No way!

28:05.387 --> 28:07.455
It's for the best, Feena.

28:07.456 --> 28:08.756
You'll freeze!

28:08.757 --> 28:09.592
No.

28:09.593 --> 28:10.758
I've survived
a few winters here.

28:10.759 --> 28:12.760
As long as I get some firewood,

28:12.761 --> 28:14.529
I'll be all right.

28:14.530 --> 28:15.597
There's room inside!

28:15.598 --> 28:17.166
The Obelisk was clear, Feena.

28:18.534 --> 28:19.335
No.

28:19.336 --> 28:21.469
You don't go
against the Obelisk!

28:21.470 --> 28:22.904
Okay?

28:22.905 --> 28:24.305
Believe me.

28:24.306 --> 28:26.007
You were here before.

28:26.008 --> 28:27.508
As one of the settlers.

28:27.509 --> 28:29.010
That's right.

28:29.011 --> 28:31.045
I've got some questions.

28:31.046 --> 28:32.748
I got some answers.

28:36.552 --> 28:38.353
A complicated machine.

28:38.354 --> 28:41.890
I am sorry our knowledge
was not more comprehensive.

28:41.891 --> 28:43.825
It's enough for me to start.

28:43.826 --> 28:46.394
You worry us, Jax.

28:46.395 --> 28:50.632
Your hatred for the humans
is unrivaled.

28:50.633 --> 28:52.934
Why should that concern you?

28:52.935 --> 28:55.370
The humans are
a capable species.

28:55.371 --> 28:57.405
Their physiology and
mental aptitude

28:57.406 --> 29:00.775
makes them a far better host
than the Karik ever were.

29:00.776 --> 29:02.076
We need them.

29:02.077 --> 29:05.146
All the more reason to secure
our dominance over them.

29:05.147 --> 29:09.517
Our dominance is not
in question.

29:09.518 --> 29:11.452
You disapprove
of what I'm doing?

29:11.453 --> 29:13.254
We caution you.

29:13.255 --> 29:16.391
The more we seek to
weaken the human,

29:16.392 --> 29:20.161
the more we silence his
primal instincts and skills:

29:20.162 --> 29:23.464
The very strength he brings
to our symbiotic relationship.

29:23.465 --> 29:26.668
But we must weaken the human,

29:26.669 --> 29:28.870
or they will seek
to overpower us.

29:28.871 --> 29:31.372
You speak from experience.

29:31.373 --> 29:35.109
That is why you embrace
this idea.

29:35.110 --> 29:38.313
Your human fights
you constantly.

29:38.314 --> 29:40.248
We can sense him even now.

29:40.249 --> 29:42.650
His love for the woman.

29:42.651 --> 29:44.852
His commitment to his world.

29:44.853 --> 29:48.890
That is why you dare not
let him speak or choose.

29:48.891 --> 29:52.527
Because you fear what he
will say and do.

29:52.528 --> 29:56.931
And that you will not
be able to stop him.

29:56.932 --> 30:01.002
He is strong.

30:01.003 --> 30:02.670
I am stronger.

30:02.671 --> 30:05.540
Seek balance, Jax.

30:05.541 --> 30:07.775
Push the human too much
and he will break.

30:07.776 --> 30:09.944
Push too little...

30:09.945 --> 30:16.685
and the human will break free.

30:26.729 --> 30:28.396
Is that really necessary?

30:28.397 --> 30:29.998
I'm sorry, Feena.

30:29.999 --> 30:31.666
Don't apologize to me.

30:31.667 --> 30:33.267
It's him you're treating
like a criminal.

30:33.268 --> 30:34.203
No, it's fine.

30:34.204 --> 30:35.269
It's fine.

30:35.270 --> 30:37.005
And it's safest.

30:37.006 --> 30:39.407
My parasite's still awake, so...

30:39.408 --> 30:40.942
Which means what?

30:40.943 --> 30:45.380
That it can influence me in
varying degrees.

30:45.381 --> 30:46.915
Could you make it fall asleep?

30:47.516 --> 30:48.350
If I could do that,

30:48.351 --> 30:50.218
I would have done it
a long time ago.

30:50.219 --> 30:53.788
Then how are you able to...
Overpower it?

30:53.789 --> 30:56.424
It's - It's recovering
from an illness.

30:56.425 --> 30:57.492
So it's weaker.

30:57.493 --> 31:00.962
But it's still a struggle.

31:00.963 --> 31:02.563
Settlement.

31:02.564 --> 31:03.831
Who was here?

31:03.832 --> 31:06.300
Who wasn't?

31:06.301 --> 31:09.470
All of us were here.

31:09.471 --> 31:11.539
Our daughter Kylie?

31:11.540 --> 31:13.374
Also, yeah.

31:13.375 --> 31:15.777
Yeah, she was reborn as a chil.

31:15.778 --> 31:19.347
Essentially the same age
she was when...

31:19.348 --> 31:26.254
When she died.

31:26.255 --> 31:28.890
So, the Sparks and drones
remake people of all ages?

31:28.891 --> 31:30.091
No, not adults.

31:30.092 --> 31:32.060
Adults are reborn
at the prime of their life

31:32.061 --> 31:33.528
regardless of when they died.

31:33.529 --> 31:34.562
Why?

31:34.563 --> 31:38.900
That's when we're strongest
and most fertile.

31:38.901 --> 31:40.368
I'm an old man.

31:40.369 --> 31:41.703
Given this some thought.

31:43.505 --> 31:46.007
So, the settlers had children?

31:46.008 --> 31:48.609
Yeah.

31:48.610 --> 31:52.513
Yeah, the first years
were the hardest.

31:52.514 --> 31:54.215
There were illnesses.

31:54.216 --> 31:56.851
The - The Sparks healed
what they could,

31:56.852 --> 32:03.091
but only a few infants survived.

32:03.092 --> 32:04.759
You lost a child?

32:04.760 --> 32:07.695
Yeah.

32:07.696 --> 32:10.765
And my wife.

32:10.766 --> 32:13.535
Feena died during childbirth.

32:27.282 --> 32:30.252
I think we should
give them a moment.

32:45.467 --> 32:46.501
We were married?

32:46.502 --> 32:49.704
Don't sound so surprised.

32:49.705 --> 32:50.472
Here?

32:50.473 --> 32:51.973
In the Settlement?

32:51.974 --> 32:52.674
Yeah.

32:52.675 --> 32:55.710
Abram performed the ceremony.

32:55.711 --> 32:57.678
Abram, he's a priest?

32:57.679 --> 33:03.484
Well, he's as close to a
priest as we had.

33:03.485 --> 33:08.089
And you love me?

33:08.090 --> 33:09.791
Did you even have to ask?

33:11.527 --> 33:12.427
A baby.

33:12.428 --> 33:15.630
Yeah. Our first.

33:15.631 --> 33:17.431
Little girl.

33:17.432 --> 33:19.167
Rosalyn.

33:19.168 --> 33:20.201
I always loved that name.

33:20.202 --> 33:20.969
I know you did!

33:20.970 --> 33:26.641
You picked it.

33:26.642 --> 33:29.977
She was beautiful.

33:29.978 --> 33:33.448
Like you.

33:35.250 --> 33:36.151
Do you believe him?

33:36.152 --> 33:38.853
He seemed sincere to me.

33:38.854 --> 33:42.823
He knew that Kylie
had died as a child.

33:42.824 --> 33:45.426
Silas also said
that Kylie was here.

33:45.427 --> 33:46.627
While you were gone,

33:46.628 --> 33:48.963
I went outside to the graves.

33:48.964 --> 33:51.465
Yellow scanned them.

33:51.466 --> 33:55.069
We identified your grave.

33:55.070 --> 33:56.904
And mine?

33:56.905 --> 33:58.639
I didn't see them all.

33:58.640 --> 34:03.044
But one of them must be yours.

34:03.045 --> 34:06.113
And Kylie?

34:06.114 --> 34:08.416
I'm sure Yellow could show you,

34:08.417 --> 34:12.553
if you ask.

34:12.554 --> 34:13.422
There are other things
I learned,

34:13.422 --> 34:21.422
but they can wait.

34:23.498 --> 34:28.536
It's like,
losing her all over again.

34:28.536 --> 34:29.271
What happened to her here?

34:29.272 --> 34:30.272
Did she suffer?

34:30.273 --> 34:32.273
Lynn...

34:32.274 --> 34:34.708
We don't know, we weren't here.

34:34.710 --> 34:36.543
What if she was alone?

34:36.545 --> 34:39.179
We don't know that.

34:39.181 --> 34:46.922
I wasn't with her.

34:48.790 --> 34:50.190
Where am I?

34:50.192 --> 34:51.425
I've turned off your defenses

34:51.426 --> 34:54.262
and disabled your
flight capabilities.

34:54.263 --> 34:55.529
Jax?

34:55.530 --> 34:57.331
You know my voice.

34:57.332 --> 34:59.233
What is your intention?

34:59.234 --> 35:02.003
Nothing you can do will
dissuade me, drone.

35:02.004 --> 35:05.773
Don't bother trying.

35:05.774 --> 35:12.880
Jax.

35:12.881 --> 35:15.149
You look older.

35:15.150 --> 35:17.952
How long has it been?

35:17.953 --> 35:19.588
Turn it off drone.

35:26.795 --> 35:28.229
I understand I'm just
a hologram,

35:28.230 --> 35:30.164
but I am me.

35:30.165 --> 35:32.366
You're not real.

35:32.367 --> 35:35.069
You're a deception...

35:35.070 --> 35:37.938
trickery.

35:37.939 --> 35:41.208
That's the parasite talking.

35:41.209 --> 35:43.177
I know my husband's voice
when I hear it.

35:43.178 --> 35:46.447
Then hear this.

35:46.448 --> 35:50.184
Your husband never loved you.

35:50.185 --> 35:53.755
He found you repulsive.

35:56.992 --> 36:00.628
Is that the best you can do?

36:00.629 --> 36:04.465
Do you think I ever
doubted my husband's love?

36:04.466 --> 36:08.769
His kindness,
his devotion to me.

36:08.770 --> 36:13.207
Do you think that can be
forgotten because you say so?

36:13.208 --> 36:14.875
Turn off this woman, drone.

36:14.876 --> 36:16.377
Before I turn you off.

36:16.378 --> 36:18.579
You parasites are hypocrites.

36:18.580 --> 36:19.980
You accuse me of deception,

36:19.981 --> 36:22.283
but all you give are lies.

36:22.284 --> 36:24.285
I will not be manipulated
by a machine...

36:24.286 --> 36:27.288
I'm not a machine.

36:27.289 --> 36:29.824
I'm the woman who loved Jax.

36:29.825 --> 36:37.825
Who still does.

36:41.436 --> 36:45.306
I know you can hear me, Jax.

36:45.307 --> 36:47.742
I know you're fighting.

36:47.743 --> 36:52.413
Whatever it's telling you,
it's not true.

36:52.414 --> 36:55.616
You were stronger.

36:55.617 --> 36:58.519
You were loved.

36:58.520 --> 37:02.556
And you're not alone.

37:02.557 --> 37:07.963
I will stand with you always.

37:56.278 --> 37:59.380
You don't have this kind of
view where you come from?

37:59.381 --> 38:01.382
Seattle?

38:01.383 --> 38:04.018
No.

38:04.019 --> 38:07.455
No, between the smog
and the light pollution,

38:07.456 --> 38:11.025
you're lucky if you
see the moon.

38:11.026 --> 38:13.360
You have a favorite
constellation?

38:13.361 --> 38:17.765
Well, I - I don't know many.

38:17.766 --> 38:22.236
I see the big dipper.

38:22.237 --> 38:24.572
Orion.

38:24.573 --> 38:26.407
That's about it I think.

38:26.408 --> 38:30.978
Both sad stories.

38:30.979 --> 38:32.980
Well, both myths.

38:32.981 --> 38:36.784
Orion and Callisto that is.

38:36.785 --> 38:41.889
Those constellations
represent sad stories.

38:41.890 --> 38:44.525
Love lost.

38:44.526 --> 38:49.763
Jealousy, infidelity, death.

38:49.764 --> 38:53.133
Ancients looked at the stars
and saw sorrow.

38:53.134 --> 38:55.336
And what do you see?

38:55.337 --> 39:03.337
Sorrow to come.

39:03.879 --> 39:08.849
There's something out there,
isn't there?

39:08.850 --> 39:10.818
Something dangerous.

39:10.819 --> 39:15.256
Everyone here seems
to know but me.

39:15.257 --> 39:17.324
Feeling a little bit
in the dark?

39:17.325 --> 39:19.260
I am, yeah.

39:19.261 --> 39:21.395
Nearly every door in this
place requires clearance

39:21.396 --> 39:23.664
that I don't have.

39:23.665 --> 39:26.800
And the one door that I can
go through leads to a cubicle

39:26.801 --> 39:29.803
with almost every psychological
examination known to man.

39:29.804 --> 39:32.339
So, if you're testing
for something,

39:32.340 --> 39:37.511
I want to know what, and why.

39:37.512 --> 39:41.315
Something dangerous
is coming James.

39:41.316 --> 39:44.518
And yes, we've been testing you.

39:44.519 --> 39:49.957
But there's really only one more
question I have to ask you.

39:49.958 --> 39:52.760
Do you love Feena?

39:52.761 --> 39:54.428
Feena?

39:54.429 --> 39:56.864
What does she have
to do with this?

39:56.865 --> 40:00.634
Everything.

40:00.635 --> 40:03.003
It's a simple question really.

40:03.004 --> 40:09.143
Do you love Feena enough
to give your own life?

40:09.144 --> 40:11.212
Yes.

40:12.514 --> 40:18.519
I thought so.

40:18.520 --> 40:20.322
What's this?

40:21.823 --> 40:23.391
Clearance.

40:50.885 --> 40:53.253
I'm sorry, Feena.

40:53.254 --> 40:56.056
Everything I've told you
is true.

40:56.057 --> 41:02.330
I only wish that I were stronger
so it couldn't take me.

41:31.292 --> 41:34.795
You're attempting
to reprogram me, Jax.

41:34.796 --> 41:37.297
I do not need a playbyplay.

41:37.298 --> 41:39.800
You do not understand
the human mind.

41:39.801 --> 41:41.835
It is too delicate an organ
to be altered

41:41.836 --> 41:44.805
in the way you imagine.

41:44.806 --> 41:49.910
Manipulating the human mind
is where I excel drone.

41:49.911 --> 41:51.512
Do you know how easy
it is to fill them

41:51.513 --> 41:57.351
with rage, lust, malice?

41:57.352 --> 42:01.122
All by using their own hormones,
proteins, enzymes.

42:02.524 --> 42:05.025
Is that how you do it?

42:05.026 --> 42:10.664
By tinkering with our
endocrine system?

42:10.665 --> 42:13.034
You're running out of ideas.

42:13.702 --> 42:16.336
Well, you're one to talk.

42:16.337 --> 42:18.772
I mean, all you do is you
copy and manipulate what the

42:18.773 --> 42:21.675
human body already does.

42:21.676 --> 42:24.945
The Skin Riders haven't had
an original idea yet.

42:24.946 --> 42:26.947
You won't rile me, human.

42:26.948 --> 42:29.983
You see,
but I'm not just any human.

42:29.984 --> 42:31.585
I'm your human.

42:31.586 --> 42:32.586
Although, technically speaking,

42:32.587 --> 42:35.889
actually, you don't own me.

42:35.890 --> 42:39.793
Ooooh, but I do.

42:39.794 --> 42:43.630
From the moment I infected you.

42:43.631 --> 42:47.468
Such a weak host.

42:47.469 --> 42:50.471
Okay, well where
would you rather be?

42:50.472 --> 42:52.706
What suits you better
do you think?

42:52.707 --> 42:55.175
Swine maybe?

42:55.176 --> 43:01.815
Some rodent of some variety?

43:01.816 --> 43:04.485
We'll reach your core
soon enough.

43:04.486 --> 43:06.787
And rip out every brain state
it holds.

43:06.788 --> 43:08.889
Yeah, that's the spirit.

43:08.890 --> 43:09.957
Rip us out.

43:09.958 --> 43:11.992
Destroy what you fear.

43:11.993 --> 43:13.594
I do not fear you.

43:13.595 --> 43:15.229
But you do.

43:15.230 --> 43:21.235
So desparately that you
pretend that I don't exist.

43:21.236 --> 43:25.906
All you do is run from me with
your tail between your legs.

43:25.907 --> 43:29.209
What's it like to be you?

43:29.210 --> 43:32.679
To feel of the love of my wife?

43:32.680 --> 43:34.915
Her constancy.

43:34.916 --> 43:36.817
Her devotion.

43:36.818 --> 43:39.753
And to know that none of it,

43:39.754 --> 43:42.022
none of it,

43:42.023 --> 43:45.959
is directed at you?

43:45.960 --> 43:49.062
What kind of hell is that?

43:49.063 --> 43:55.068
It's a taste...
What it means to be human.

43:55.069 --> 43:58.539
But for none of it to be yours.

43:58.540 --> 44:01.842
Yeah, it's no wonder
you hate me.

44:01.843 --> 44:07.315
I'm a constant reminder
of how alone you really are.

44:30.438 --> 44:32.673
The drone showed you a memory?

44:32.674 --> 44:33.807
Two.

44:33.808 --> 44:35.576
My own and someone elses.

44:35.577 --> 44:40.381
This woman's.

44:47.088 --> 44:48.689
And she had a drone?

44:48.690 --> 44:50.457
She knew me.

44:50.458 --> 44:55.596
I think she was watching me at
the hospital, when Tasha died.

44:55.597 --> 44:57.731
I... I got the sense,

44:57.732 --> 45:00.334
she'd been watching me
for awhile.

45:00.335 --> 45:02.536
And you never saw her again?

45:02.537 --> 45:04.371
Not that I know of.

45:04.372 --> 45:09.443
I didn't even remember her
until I saw her in that memory.

45:09.444 --> 45:10.811
She was...

45:10.812 --> 45:12.579
just a person I met.

45:12.580 --> 45:14.815
So humans helped collect
brain states?

45:14.816 --> 45:16.550
If she was human.

45:16.551 --> 45:19.653
I'd say anything is possible
at this point.

45:19.654 --> 45:21.989
And she had Sparks.

45:21.990 --> 45:23.490
Keep in mind.

45:23.491 --> 45:26.093
This is a year
before the invasion.

45:26.094 --> 45:27.527
That's when Tasha died.

45:27.528 --> 45:28.896
So someone was
recording brain states

45:28.897 --> 45:32.165
long before the Karik got here.

45:32.166 --> 45:34.001
Like they knew
the Karik were coming.

45:34.002 --> 45:37.104
Like they knew humans
would lose.

45:37.105 --> 45:39.606
There was little warning
before the war began.

45:39.607 --> 45:41.708
There was no warning.

45:41.709 --> 45:44.111
But it sounds like there
could have been.

45:44.112 --> 45:46.980
Why would anyone
keep that a secret?

45:46.981 --> 45:50.651
Avoid global panic.

45:50.652 --> 45:55.188
Avoid turning the world
into chaotic anarchy.

45:55.189 --> 45:56.623
We could have prepared.

45:56.624 --> 45:58.392
At least militarily speaking.

45:58.393 --> 46:00.460
Maybe we did.

46:00.461 --> 46:02.262
Maybe there are all kinds
of contingencies,

46:02.263 --> 46:05.432
including one for extinction.

46:05.433 --> 46:07.734
That doesn't explain the
Sparks...

46:07.735 --> 46:08.469
or the drones,

46:08.470 --> 46:09.903
or the Obelisk.

46:09.904 --> 46:11.638
None of those were
humanengineered.

46:11.639 --> 46:14.174
Humans had help, Ezra.

46:14.175 --> 46:17.278
Help that came before the Karik.

46:18.980 --> 46:23.116
Allies in the war
before the war began.

46:23.117 --> 46:27.354
Did this woman say
anything else?

46:27.355 --> 46:31.058
We should ask Yellow
to produce her brain state.

46:31.059 --> 46:37.064
Maybe we can ask her
questions directly.

46:37.065 --> 46:39.099
Where is Yellow?

46:39.100 --> 46:42.303
She's usually buzzing
around our ears.

47:10.698 --> 47:18.405
Yellow.

47:18.406 --> 47:26.406
Yellow?

48:10.458 --> 48:14.895
Didn't mean to scare you.

48:14.896 --> 48:17.931
You still want to be alone?

48:17.932 --> 48:23.603
I just, I don't know if I should
feel grateful to be alive,

48:23.604 --> 48:26.907
or horrified.

48:26.908 --> 48:32.513
I think it's okay to feel both.

48:37.385 --> 48:42.289
You're a few years younger.

48:42.290 --> 48:46.059
Yeah, I - There's no
pregnancy stretch marks either.

48:46.060 --> 48:48.128
I checked.

48:48.129 --> 48:50.410
You were never more beautiful
than when you were pregnant.

48:51.532 --> 48:52.933
On that, we'll have to disagree.

48:52.934 --> 48:54.202
But I will take it.

48:58.606 --> 49:01.808
You're looking
pretty spry yourself.

49:01.809 --> 49:02.977
You been working out?

49:03.778 --> 49:06.079
I was woven this way.

49:06.080 --> 49:11.184
But I'll take it.

49:11.185 --> 49:16.523
When we got engaged, that's
the age you are right now.

49:16.524 --> 49:18.725
You can tell that
from studying my face?

49:18.726 --> 49:21.461
I'm very good
at studying your face.

49:21.462 --> 49:29.462
It's my favorite pastime.

49:29.570 --> 49:31.838
Do you remember dying?

49:31.839 --> 49:34.941
There's a question
you don't hear every day.

49:34.942 --> 49:38.445
Do you?

49:38.446 --> 49:39.813
No.

49:39.814 --> 49:42.949
I remember it.

49:42.950 --> 49:46.486
I held you while you died.

49:46.487 --> 49:49.456
I remember your last breath.

49:49.457 --> 49:51.992
The last time you
blinked your eyes.

49:51.993 --> 49:56.396
The last time you looked at me.

49:56.397 --> 50:01.636
I remember losing you.

50:04.739 --> 50:08.975
I am so grateful you're alive.

50:08.976 --> 50:10.911
Whoever did this for us,

50:10.912 --> 50:13.780
whoever gave you back to me,

50:13.781 --> 50:17.051
I'll do whatever they ask.

50:36.871 --> 50:39.172
Agent Duncan.

50:39.173 --> 50:42.375
What would you say is
the greatest human virtue?

50:42.376 --> 50:44.844
I thought we were done
with the psychological exams.

50:44.845 --> 50:46.313
It's no test.

50:46.314 --> 50:49.583
It's just... a question.

50:49.584 --> 50:50.951
Greatest human virtue.

50:50.952 --> 50:54.487
Our capacity to love.

50:54.488 --> 50:55.789
To look at someone
and see their faults,

50:55.790 --> 50:59.559
and yet still place their
happiness above our own.

50:59.560 --> 51:03.563
And what would you say
are your greatest virtues?

51:03.564 --> 51:05.732
Now this question was on
one of those tests

51:05.733 --> 51:08.134
and I wrote
a very lengthy essay on it.

51:08.135 --> 51:10.804
I didn't read it.

51:10.805 --> 51:12.005
You didn't read...

51:12.006 --> 51:14.608
Kay.

51:14.609 --> 51:17.510
I work hard.

51:17.511 --> 51:21.147
I dedicate myself to whatever
assignment I'm given.

51:21.148 --> 51:22.282
I'm quick to forgive,

51:22.283 --> 51:26.052
but also very quick
to seek justice.

51:26.053 --> 51:29.456
I'm a team player.

51:29.457 --> 51:32.326
And my feet never stink.

51:33.127 --> 51:33.894
Never?

51:33.895 --> 51:35.196
No, baby powder.

51:35.696 --> 51:36.696
Wonderful thing.

51:39.367 --> 51:41.301
Agent Duncan.

51:41.302 --> 51:42.869
I'm going to show you something

51:42.870 --> 51:46.406
because I feel it's
the right thing to do.

51:46.407 --> 51:52.112
Do you ever follow your gut?

51:52.113 --> 51:53.813
Sure.

51:53.814 --> 52:00.987
What is your gut
telling you right now?

52:00.988 --> 52:04.759
That I should follow you
into that room.

52:06.027 --> 52:08.763
I thought so.

52:16.504 --> 52:18.338
Agent Duncan.

52:18.339 --> 52:23.376
What would you say is the
greatest human virtue?

52:23.377 --> 52:27.648
Our capacity to love.

52:38.059 --> 52:40.361
Our capacity to love.

52:55.376 --> 53:03.376
Stay here!

53:03.417 --> 53:05.486
I won't!

53:24.772 --> 53:26.140
Duncan?

53:55.369 --> 53:57.438
Feena!

54:13.387 --> 54:16.156
Duncan?

54:16.157 --> 54:17.424
What happened?

54:17.425 --> 54:18.992
It was a setup.

54:18.993 --> 54:22.128
The whole rescue was just
to get him in here.

54:22.129 --> 54:24.831
No.

54:24.832 --> 54:26.566
You were lying?

54:26.567 --> 54:27.101
No.

54:27.102 --> 54:29.502
Not... Not lying.

54:29.503 --> 54:34.140
I mean I... I gave Duncan
a little extra leash.

54:34.141 --> 54:38.244
So, he thought he was
actually helping you.

54:38.245 --> 54:39.679
The weapon's gone.

54:39.680 --> 54:40.960
He must have
hidden it somewhere.

54:41.549 --> 54:46.653
You're never gonna find it.

54:46.654 --> 54:49.723
There are... There are
far too many hiding places here.

54:53.527 --> 54:54.561
You'll tell us where it is.

54:54.562 --> 54:57.198
Or what?

54:57.898 --> 55:01.268
I mean, you can't kill Duncan.

55:03.170 --> 55:06.140
She won't let you.

55:13.681 --> 55:15.882
Besides.

55:15.883 --> 55:17.817
If you kill me,

55:17.818 --> 55:21.822
I mean, you're never
going to find your daughter.

55:23.691 --> 55:26.025
Yep.

55:26.026 --> 55:28.628
Kylie's alive.

55:28.629 --> 55:30.096
Now.

55:30.097 --> 55:33.566
You give us what we want...

55:33.567 --> 55:36.770
she'll stay that way.
