Against some random street action,

grateful for that.

Kesey at Major Crimes said it had something to

Her name is
Stephanie Cordell.

03:44.397 --> 03:45.864
She was a lawyer.

03:45.932 --> 03:47.866
We worked together
in the Crown Attorney's office.

03:47.934 --> 03:50.069
- Sorry to hear that.
- Eight years ago,

03:50.136 --> 03:52.537
she left the office
after working late,

03:52.605 --> 03:54.271
- and was never seen again.
- So what, she just vanished?

03:54.339 --> 03:57.942
- There were signs of a struggle in her apartment.
- Suspects?

03:58.010 --> 04:00.044
Three. One was a boyfriend,
a Justin Walker.

04:00.112 --> 04:01.878
He's got a record
for two assault charges.

04:01.946 --> 04:04.447
That's an odd choice
of a boyfriend for a lawyer.

04:04.515 --> 04:06.917
Well, they met when she was
working as a public defender.

04:06.984 --> 04:09.252
She realized her mistake
and she broke it off.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.254
I'm guessing
he didn't like that.

04:11.322 --> 04:14.357
Next suspect?
Unfortunately, persons unknown.

04:14.425 --> 04:16.659
She filed a report with the cops
a couple weeks earlier.

04:16.728 --> 04:19.028
She saw someone with a camera
looking through her window.

04:19.096 --> 04:20.896
She thought
she was being peeped.

04:20.964 --> 04:23.099
An "admirer"
who may have turned violent.

04:23.166 --> 04:25.034
- The third?
- The third was

04:25.102 --> 04:28.237
a drug dealer she was
prosecuting--a James McCallan.

04:28.304 --> 04:30.239
He's suspected
in the disappearance

04:30.306 --> 04:33.442
of three rival drug dealers.
This guy's a real nasty piece of work.

04:33.509 --> 04:35.777
The police could never build a
case against any of these guys,

04:35.845 --> 04:39.214
so no charges were ever laid.
Eventually, the investigation was shut down.

04:39.281 --> 04:41.549
Well, let's go talk
to this McCallan guy,

04:41.617 --> 04:43.551
see if the discovery
of Stephanie's body shook

04:43.619 --> 04:45.854
- anything loose.
- We need to canvass

04:45.921 --> 04:48.857
that neighbourhood. Someone might have seen
something. - We're talking almost a decade.

04:48.924 --> 04:52.492
- Just do it, Michelle.
- Of course.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.695
I was just gonna say
we'll need Metro's help.

04:55.764 --> 04:57.697
We have things going for us
we didn't eight years ago.

04:57.766 --> 04:59.666
We have Stephanie's body
and we have you.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.602
Now we'll be able to know
if someone's telling the truth.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.938
Sometimes
it's not that simple.

05:05.006 --> 05:08.408
- Let's try to keep positive, shall we?
- Yeah.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.552
We have a body.

05:20.620 --> 05:23.621
We have evidence.
We have a damn telepath.

05:23.689 --> 05:26.057
This should be a case
we can solve.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.126
You went out on a limb
to form this unit.

05:28.194 --> 05:30.528
Do you really want to risk all
of that for a personal mission?

05:30.596 --> 05:32.530
I guess I've always felt
a little bit guilty that justice

05:32.598 --> 05:36.334
wasn't done for Stephanie.
Now I can make sure it is.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.468
Fair enough.

05:42.240 --> 05:46.210
Now you're eating into my day, and
I know it's not your first day.

05:46.278 --> 05:48.946
All right, here.
You take it easy, all right?

05:49.014 --> 05:50.915
Thanks, Kelly. Hey.

05:50.982 --> 05:53.717
- Isn't that, uh, your--
- My partner <i>du jour?</i> Yeah.

05:53.785 --> 05:55.718
- What happened?
- We go out

05:55.786 --> 05:58.721
on this apartment call, but when
we got there nobody was responding

05:58.789 --> 06:00.723
and the door was locked.
So, I'm calling dispatch.

06:00.791 --> 06:02.725
Meanwhile this guy's trying
to break down the door

06:02.793 --> 06:04.894
like Chuck Norris.
Popped out his shoulder.

06:04.962 --> 06:07.730
Well, I guess not everybody graduates
at the top half of the class.

06:07.798 --> 06:10.398
Yeah, and I keep
getting partnered with him.

06:10.466 --> 06:13.735

06:17.673 --> 06:19.241

- Two tickets to paradise.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.547
- Just me and you.
- You're kidding.

06:26.614 --> 06:28.983
No. A week of sand,
sun, and sweat.

06:29.084 --> 06:32.286

it sounds really great.

06:33.021 --> 06:34.788

06:34.857 --> 06:37.391
Terrific.
Like, just, um...

06:37.425 --> 06:40.394
What? Just an amazing gift
from a really great guy?

06:40.462 --> 06:43.396
Is that what you were gonna say?
<i>Code Blue.</i> - That's a Code Blue.

06:43.464 --> 06:45.398
- Yeah.
- I gotta go.

06:45.432 --> 06:48.034

It's Stephanie. - How... how?

07:00.046 --> 07:03.048
- They used dental records.
- Right.

07:04.985 --> 07:06.752
Here are some of her things--

07:06.819 --> 07:09.255
her watch,
her rings, her bracelet.

07:09.322 --> 07:11.357
Whoever killed her,
it wasn't a robbery.

07:14.293 --> 07:15.760
How's your mom?

07:15.827 --> 07:19.397
Your support was the only thing that really
got her through when Steph disappeared.

07:19.964 --> 07:21.399
Then finding the body just

07:21.466 --> 07:24.102
opened that wound again,
you know?

07:25.169 --> 07:26.771
Who would do this?

07:28.038 --> 07:29.573
Who would kill somebody
and then

07:29.641 --> 07:32.842
shove them into the wall like
a piece of god damn insulation?

07:34.879 --> 07:39.082
Becky, I'm sorry.
You have to think, though.

07:39.150 --> 07:42.752
Is there anything she said?
Anybody who threatened her?

07:42.820 --> 07:45.222
- Anybody she had a problem with?
- Nobody.

07:46.290 --> 07:48.624
Nobody hated Stephanie.

07:48.691 --> 07:50.726
She was just nice.

07:51.794 --> 07:54.863
She was just my sister.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.001
Will you call me
if you think of anything?

07:59.069 --> 08:01.203
- Sure.
- OK.

08:02.771 --> 08:04.339
Thanks.

08:11.747 --> 08:13.815
- Did you get a read?
- Bits and pieces,

08:13.882 --> 08:18.453
really. Just scraps.
Them playing together as kids.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.187
Someone's wedding.

08:20.255 --> 08:24.759
Them cooking a family meal.
It's... it's really loose.

08:25.827 --> 08:28.996
Why was I reading her?
Is she a suspect?

08:30.564 --> 08:32.166
It was a long shot.

08:32.232 --> 08:36.837
Families have secrets sometimes.
Maybe something she didn't even know she knew.

08:37.404 --> 08:39.138
Somebody has to know
what happened to her.

08:39.956 --> 08:41.073
Yeah.

08:54.087 --> 08:57.189
I guess I always thought--
hoped--

08:57.256 --> 08:59.191
that she was out there--

08:59.258 --> 09:01.193
maybe run off somewhere.

09:01.260 --> 09:03.963
Michael was a great boss.
Always the optimist.

09:04.030 --> 09:06.698
No matter how bad a case got,
you were sure we'd win.

09:06.765 --> 09:09.367
Can you tell us anything else
about the case Stephanie was handling?

09:09.934 --> 09:11.870
James McCallan. Drug dealer.

09:11.937 --> 09:14.205
He was charged with taking out
three rival dealers

09:14.272 --> 09:17.141
- for their territories.
- What happened to the case?

09:17.209 --> 09:20.845
Main witness was a snitch who decided if
the prosecutor can vanish, so could he.

09:20.913 --> 09:23.714
- Recanted everything.
- The case just fell apart?

09:23.781 --> 09:25.716
Completely imploded.
The guy was right to be scared.

09:25.783 --> 09:28.219
Five weeks later,
he was shot and dead in Rexdale.

09:29.286 --> 09:31.989
I never gave up on McCallan.
He's a smart one.

09:32.057 --> 09:34.558
Laundered his money,
invested in real estate,

09:34.626 --> 09:37.061
likes to think
he's a model citizen now.

09:38.129 --> 09:39.896
I'd enjoy
seeing him go down.

09:40.463 --> 09:42.165
- Keep me in the loop.
- Yeah.

09:46.837 --> 09:50.073
- OK, so...
- Hey.

09:50.141 --> 09:53.709
I got something. I tracked down
the jilted boyfriend.

10:03.653 --> 10:05.587
Justin Walker?

10:05.655 --> 10:08.023
- Yeah, who's asking?
- IIB.

10:08.091 --> 10:12.293
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about Stephanie Cordell.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.628
God, you people are
unbelievable.

10:14.696 --> 10:17.631
I mean, after all these years you come
back, drag me and my family into this?

10:17.699 --> 10:20.968
Her body was found stuffed into the
wall of a building last night.

10:21.036 --> 10:25.239
Now, it's our understanding that you
two didn't part on the best of terms.

10:27.175 --> 10:29.376
Look, I told this all
to the cops back then.

10:29.444 --> 10:31.578
Well, we have new questions
about how you broke it off.

10:31.645 --> 10:33.515
You must have been
very upset.

10:35.383 --> 10:39.152
- You know, it happens sometimes--crimes of passion.
- We'd like to talk to you about

10:39.220 --> 10:43.222
- the night of her disappearance.
- I told them everything back then.

10:43.290 --> 10:45.458
Kids, come on.
Let's go inside.

10:45.525 --> 10:47.793
And the boyfriend was
strangling her?

10:47.860 --> 10:49.828
- That's what it looked like.
- That's more like it.

10:49.896 --> 10:53.132
- I was beginning to wonder about you.
- Look, I just want to warn you,

10:53.200 --> 10:55.134
the mind is
a very tricky place.

10:55.202 --> 10:58.804
We can't jump to conclusions
because of something that I read.

10:58.871 --> 11:01.607
Hey. Forensics
just sent over some

11:01.674 --> 11:05.443
preliminary post-mortem results. The cause of death
appears to be blunt force trauma to the head.

11:05.511 --> 11:08.814
The impression in her skull was
consistent with pieces

11:08.881 --> 11:11.416
of a glass vase that was found
on the floor in her apartment.

11:11.484 --> 11:13.351
So the killer left
the murder weapon?

11:13.419 --> 11:15.487
The pieces were analyzed
at the time and cleared.

11:15.554 --> 11:17.855
There were no traces of blood
or the murderer's DNA on them.

11:17.923 --> 11:19.857
Any indications
of strangulation?

11:19.925 --> 11:24.095
- Nope.
- So why did you see the boyfriend strangling her?

11:24.162 --> 11:28.165
Well, uh, I mean, maybe he's remembering
how angry she made him feel

11:28.233 --> 11:31.468
or maybe it was something he thought
of doing to her. I don't know.

11:31.536 --> 11:36.472
So-- so fantasies can
appear as reality?

11:36.540 --> 11:39.509
If someone visualizes them,
yeah.

11:39.576 --> 11:43.479
Let me tell you, dementia,
I mean, that's a real trip.

11:43.547 --> 11:46.082
So we don't actually know
if this guy killed her.

11:46.150 --> 11:48.651
So this is
a big waste of my time.

11:51.788 --> 11:56.191
OK. You guys want to hear the rest
of what I found out?  - Yes, please.

11:56.259 --> 11:59.194
There was a series of small puncture
wounds just below the collarbone.

11:59.262 --> 12:02.230
- That'd odd. I wonder how she got those.
- Maybe she fell on something--

12:02.298 --> 12:04.398
- glass?
- The marks don't match

12:04.466 --> 12:06.400
anything on the table or any
of the glass on the floor.

12:06.468 --> 12:09.070
By the way, the building
where we found the body--

12:09.138 --> 12:10.805
you'll never guess
who owned it.

12:12.873 --> 12:14.475
James McCallan?

12:14.543 --> 12:17.344
IIB. I'd like to talk to you
about Stephanie Cordell.

12:21.948 --> 12:24.484
That's my lawyer.
Call him.

12:25.052 --> 12:26.920
Her body was found
in a building

12:26.988 --> 12:30.824
owned by you.
The factory at 22 Madsen.

12:30.892 --> 12:33.393
She was pretty intent
on bringing you down.

12:33.460 --> 12:37.897
That must have made you mad,
maybe given you some ideas.

12:41.569 --> 12:44.003
That building would be
the perfect hiding place.

12:44.071 --> 12:47.207
An old building being renovated.
Who'd notice a bricked-up wall?

12:47.274 --> 12:49.342
Hide the smell.

12:49.410 --> 12:51.344
You know the Crown's been
trying to pin this on me

12:51.412 --> 12:54.413
for years.
So, that's my lawyer. Call him.

12:57.082 --> 12:58.215
Did you get anything?

12:58.216 --> 13:01.019
Yeah he pictured some crazy-ass
bald dude attacking Stephanie.

13:01.087 --> 13:02.621
Just what we need--
another suspect.

13:02.689 --> 13:06.157
I'm imagine this isn't going to make Klein
any happier, is it?       - Welcome to IIB.

13:06.689 --> 13:07.957
No.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.935
No.

13:11.050 --> 13:12.435
No.

13:13.203 --> 13:15.737
No. No.

13:16.305 --> 13:17.304
No.

13:17.305 --> 13:18.807
McCallan certainly doesn't

13:18.875 --> 13:21.343
- choose his team for their looks.
- No kidding.

13:21.411 --> 13:24.145
No. Here we go. Yeah.

13:24.213 --> 13:26.181
This is the guy
McCallan thought about.

13:26.248 --> 13:31.085
Daniel Fallon. Numerous convictions
for assault, possession, extortion.

13:31.153 --> 13:34.021
Standard resume
for a grade A enforcer.

13:34.089 --> 13:38.193
- Can you get an address?
- Yeah, he's on probation. Give me an hour.

13:38.260 --> 13:40.661
- I'll find him.
- Cool. Right on, man.

13:42.730 --> 13:46.766
I don't know why I even bother playing with you.
All right. OK, that's my last 20.

13:46.834 --> 13:49.936
Get out of here. Hey, man.
How's it going?

13:50.004 --> 13:52.673
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I just gotta pick up a few things.

13:52.740 --> 13:55.974
- Like a shift with me?
- No, no. IIB is going crazy.

13:56.042 --> 13:57.876
Great. So I'm riding
with another newbie.

13:57.944 --> 14:00.313
Hey, uh,
how'd it go with Sandy?

14:00.380 --> 14:02.515
- Well...
- You ask her out on that trip?

14:02.583 --> 14:06.185
- Yeah, yeah, she was a little funny about it.
- A little funny?

14:06.253 --> 14:08.221
- I'm not surprised.
- Oh, no?

14:08.288 --> 14:11.823
No. For some people, going on vacation
is a big step forward in a relationship.

14:11.890 --> 14:14.492
You read that somewhere,
right? Like <i>Teen Beat?</i>

14:15.290 --> 14:16.461
You read it too.

14:16.529 --> 14:19.698
Hey, I also read
in another edition of <i>Teen Beat,</i>

14:19.765 --> 14:22.734
just call her, talk to her,
listen to her. Excuse me.

14:22.801 --> 14:25.036
Hey.

14:25.104 --> 14:27.504
Hey. You interested
in some undercover work?

14:27.572 --> 14:30.507
- Undercover? Yeah, sure.
<i>- Great.</i>

14:30.575 --> 14:33.310
I'll send you the details.

14:33.378 --> 14:36.380
Undercover?
Like Donnie Brasco.

14:36.448 --> 14:38.014
"I'm in the dark here!"

14:38.082 --> 14:39.383
"Hooah!"

14:39.451 --> 14:42.018
Donnie Brasco.

14:42.086 --> 14:43.686
You haven't seen it?

14:54.131 --> 14:56.832
Hey. Can I grab
a pint of amber?

15:01.304 --> 15:04.172
This is
a nice place, huh?

15:04.740 --> 15:06.174
It's a place.

15:06.242 --> 15:09.711
Yeah, any place with beer taps
and frosty glasses:

15:09.779 --> 15:12.414
Pure heaven after a day
like I had.

15:12.482 --> 15:14.048
Hey.

15:16.617 --> 15:20.053
I tell you, my man,
today at work...

15:20.121 --> 15:22.390
One headache
after another.

15:22.457 --> 15:24.958
Mostly trying
to beat back the competition.

15:25.726 --> 15:27.395
You gotta be
vigilant, right?

15:27.462 --> 15:29.997
You gotta show 'em
who's the man.

15:30.064 --> 15:34.133
- That's what they say.
- Especially if they think they're untouchable, right?

15:34.201 --> 15:35.702
I mean, you gotta...

15:35.770 --> 15:39.238
you gotta
make a point, right?

15:44.545 --> 15:47.413
- Who the hell are you?
- Just a guy having a drink.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.419
Knock yourself out.

16:13.872 --> 16:17.408
Hey, I was just having
a conversation, man.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.610
<i>Punch, block,
trap, punch.</i>

16:20.678 --> 16:23.046
You want to go?

16:28.519 --> 16:30.987
Even the computer club kids
think they're tough now.

16:31.055 --> 16:34.924
- Who the hell are you?
- Hey! Drop your weapon!

16:40.664 --> 16:43.131
Don't underestimate
the debating team chicks.

16:45.502 --> 16:47.436
Yeah, you took your time,
Michelle.

16:47.504 --> 16:49.805
- I was enjoying the show.
- Yeah, thank you.

16:52.241 --> 16:54.642
You have quite the record,
Mr. Fallon.

16:54.710 --> 16:57.144
Do the names
Fabian Jenkins,

16:57.212 --> 16:59.981
Jorma Tikkanen, or Mitch
Williams ring any bells?

17:00.048 --> 17:05.653
They're all drug dealers, competitors of James
McCallan, and you were McCallan's muscle,

17:05.721 --> 17:08.954
so when they disappear, I gotta believe
you know something about that.

17:12.627 --> 17:17.063
That's what this is about?
Cops asked me all this years ago.

17:17.131 --> 17:19.031
I got nothing new to say.

17:20.099 --> 17:21.702
Heard
you picked up Fallon.

17:21.770 --> 17:23.869
He tried to kill
one of my people.

17:23.936 --> 17:25.570
Charming. Any luck?

17:25.638 --> 17:28.708
Not yet. But I think things
are about to get interesting.

17:28.776 --> 17:31.911
- Look, where's my lawyer?
- Speaking of lawyers, have you ever heard of one

17:31.978 --> 17:34.814
- named Stephanie Cordell?
- Should I have?

17:34.882 --> 17:37.149
Well, your boss had a problem
with her, too.

17:37.217 --> 17:39.518
I want that bitch dead!

17:39.585 --> 17:42.521
He had more than a problem,
didn't he? He wanted her dead.

17:43.088 --> 17:45.524
She was going to bring him down
for the murder of those dealers.

17:45.591 --> 17:48.693
That's when a problem solver
like you steps in, isn't it?

17:52.331 --> 17:54.766
I'd like to consult
with my client.

17:54.834 --> 17:57.000
- In private.
- You do that.

17:57.068 --> 17:59.002
And while you're at it,
I would advise your client

17:59.070 --> 18:01.071
to start cooperating
in this investigation.

18:01.139 --> 18:04.542
- And why would he do that?
- Your client tried to kill

18:04.609 --> 18:07.244
an officer
with an unlicensed weapon.

18:07.312 --> 18:09.713
That's what I call
probation violation.

18:09.781 --> 18:11.848
And I call your arrest
entrapment.

18:21.158 --> 18:25.194
- We have something concrete on him, right?
- Yeah, I told you.

18:25.262 --> 18:28.229
Assault, possession of a weapon,
breaking terms of probation.

18:28.297 --> 18:30.732
I mean something tying him
to Stephanie's murder.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.602
- No.
- What led you to Fallon?

18:33.670 --> 18:35.504
Our lead was
from a confidential source.

18:35.572 --> 18:38.474
I thought we had an understanding.
You were to keep me in the loop.

18:39.541 --> 18:42.845
McCallan's gonna be
extra cautious now.

18:42.912 --> 18:46.413
Let's hope this little gamble
of yours didn't blow anything.

18:57.782 --> 19:00.015
So what exactly
did you get from Fallon?

19:01.451 --> 19:04.387
I saw the three dealers that they were
originally looking at McCallan for,

19:04.454 --> 19:06.889
shooting,
bodies being buried,

19:06.956 --> 19:08.824
towers, chimneys of some sort.

19:08.892 --> 19:11.860
OK, great.
Uh, give Dev a description

19:11.928 --> 19:13.297
and we'll locate them.

19:13.298 --> 19:15.897
- Anything about Stephanie?
- Nothing. No.

19:18.167 --> 19:21.169
When you read McCallan
you saw Fallon killing her.

19:21.237 --> 19:25.006
- So why didn't Fallon think that too?
- Maybe he didn't do it.

19:25.074 --> 19:27.175
Maybe McCallan jumped
to a conclusion--

19:27.243 --> 19:30.711
he thought Fallon had killed her
for him. I don't know.

19:30.778 --> 19:33.947
I'm not a crystal ball.
I read what they're thinking at that time;

19:34.015 --> 19:37.351
- Not what we want them to.
- I think I might have made a mistake here.

19:41.256 --> 19:43.357
- Yeah, he's thinking that.
- I'll talk to him.

19:43.425 --> 19:46.126
Working with Toby is gonna take
some getting used to.

19:46.194 --> 19:49.195
- Yeah, no kidding.
- He is not the problem here.

19:51.131 --> 19:53.999
- Me.
- Look, I can deal with the fact

19:54.067 --> 19:57.237
that this is a personal interest case for
you, but I think you owe me an explanation

19:57.304 --> 20:01.274
- as to what's really going on. - My personal
feelings have nothing to do with the details

20:01.342 --> 20:04.909
of this crime or its solution.
If they did, trust me, Michelle, I would tell you.

20:04.977 --> 20:07.713
- I'd like to leave it at that.
- OK.

20:07.780 --> 20:10.015
Now, since our telepath didn't
come up with anything,

20:10.016 --> 20:13.285
- what's our next move?
- The lab got back to us.

20:13.353 --> 20:15.654
Forensics recovered trace
evidence from Stephanie's body.

20:15.722 --> 20:19.290
Black fibres, most likely from the trunk
of the car she was transported in.

20:19.858 --> 20:22.260
Trace DNA.
Maybe we can link it to Fallon.

20:23.827 --> 20:25.796
The problem
with that line of action is...

20:25.864 --> 20:28.165
we may be looking
at the wrong suspect.

20:28.233 --> 20:30.067
- What do you mean?
- I've been identifying

20:30.135 --> 20:33.070
all the other occupants at Stephanie's
building at the time she went missing

20:33.138 --> 20:34.971
- against police reports.
- And?

20:35.038 --> 20:36.806
And...

20:36.874 --> 20:40.009
I found this.
Corey Rollins.

20:40.077 --> 20:42.078
He works as a landscaper.
He was arrested

20:42.146 --> 20:45.348
a year after Stephanie's
disappearance as a peeping Tom.

20:45.416 --> 20:48.585
Is this the guy that Stephanie filed a complaint
against?     - Maybe. And if he was,

20:48.653 --> 20:50.886
did he go
from peeping to murder?

20:54.658 --> 20:56.592
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:56.660 --> 20:58.594
Can I talk to you
for a second?

20:58.662 --> 21:00.596
Ah, yeah,
about the trip, right?

21:00.664 --> 21:04.199
Well, I'm just a little surprised
that you weren't more into it.

21:04.267 --> 21:06.001
I thought
it was a beautiful gesture.

21:06.068 --> 21:08.670
"Beautiful gesture"?
What, are we at a funeral?

21:08.737 --> 21:11.673
- OK, that's not what I meant--
- I mean, if it was too much, if I'm smothering you--

21:11.740 --> 21:14.141
For God's sake, Oz,
OK, you're not smothering me.

21:14.709 --> 21:18.212
- At least, you weren't until a minute ago.
- OK, point taken.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.881
I'm sorry
I wasn't clearer earlier.

21:21.449 --> 21:23.883
The reason I can't go with you
is because I'm...

21:23.951 --> 21:25.819
gonna be in Africa.

21:25.886 --> 21:27.285
- Africa?
- Africa.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.722
What are you talking about?

21:29.290 --> 21:31.792
OK, before you and I even
got together, I applied

21:31.859 --> 21:33.960
to an international
health organization.

21:34.028 --> 21:38.864
I just got the acceptance letter a couple days ago.
I didn't have a chance to tell you.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.867
It was something
I always wanted to do,

21:41.935 --> 21:44.870
but my ex-husband wasn't into
letting me take off for that long.

21:45.938 --> 21:49.342
You know, he just wasn't
as understanding as you are.

21:50.709 --> 21:51.977
I am pretty understanding.

21:52.045 --> 21:54.346
Yeah, you're
very understanding.

21:54.413 --> 21:58.149
So, how long is
"that long"?

22:02.054 --> 22:04.021
Corey Rollins?

22:05.589 --> 22:06.591
I've been seeing
the counsellors.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.593
I'm up on my conditions.
I'm glad to hear that,

22:08.661 --> 22:10.994
sir, but, uh,
we're actually here

22:11.062 --> 22:15.065
to talk to you about something else--something
that happened eight years ago when you lived

22:15.132 --> 22:18.101
- at 539 Gilmour Street.
- Yeah, what about it?

22:18.169 --> 22:21.538
There was another resident--
a woman named Stephanie Cordell.

22:22.306 --> 22:23.374
Did you know her?

22:23.441 --> 22:25.676
That was a long time ago.
I'm not sure.

22:25.744 --> 22:28.611
Come on, Mr. Rollins, you must
have noticed her disappearance.

22:28.679 --> 22:30.946
It was on the television,
the police were

22:31.014 --> 22:33.215
- all over your building.
- You knew her, didn't you?

22:33.283 --> 22:35.888
- Yeah.
- And did you peep her?

22:42.458 --> 22:45.360
- No.
- You're not one of these guys

22:45.428 --> 22:48.263
who likes to take pictures?
Reminders of your "girlfriends"?

22:48.330 --> 22:50.932
- That's not you?
- I bet you have them

22:51.000 --> 22:53.334
hidden away somewhere
in a secret stash.

22:57.673 --> 23:00.307
You know, I bet you
if we found them

23:00.375 --> 23:03.944
- there'd be some of Stephanie.
- Maybe other women as well.

23:04.012 --> 23:05.946
Does your counsellor know
about this?

23:06.014 --> 23:07.784
Look, you guys have got it
all wrong.

23:09.851 --> 23:12.953
- Hey, you OK?
- I did not see that coming.

23:20.561 --> 23:22.129
Damn it,
I wore the wrong shoes.

23:31.737 --> 23:33.104
Where did he go?

23:39.412 --> 23:41.112
This way.

23:47.653 --> 23:49.887
Maybe we lost him.

23:55.327 --> 23:57.528
Short cut.
This way.

23:57.996 --> 24:00.698
IIB. Just passing through.

24:00.766 --> 24:02.966
There's a back door.

24:08.706 --> 24:11.274
Look out!
Ugh!

24:20.916 --> 24:22.618
Hey, Liv, Liv, Liv.

24:24.554 --> 24:27.556
- We're stabilizing him.
- I just want a moment with him.

24:27.624 --> 24:29.558
He's going straight
into surgery.

24:29.626 --> 24:31.560
Any idea what he'll be like
when he gets out of it?

24:31.628 --> 24:33.863
The neurosurgeon is optimistic
he could make a full recovery,

24:33.930 --> 24:35.864
but with those injuries
we just don't know.

24:35.931 --> 24:37.866
Will you let us know
when he gets out of surgery?

24:37.933 --> 24:39.868
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

24:39.935 --> 24:41.870
OK, so, what now?

24:41.937 --> 24:45.707
We need to find those photographs.
They may tie this guy to Stephanie.

24:57.952 --> 24:59.553
Any luck?

24:59.621 --> 25:01.889
This guy's
a full-on hoarder.

25:01.956 --> 25:04.892
Yeah, you think that he hid those
special photos somewhere else?

25:04.959 --> 25:07.059
Well, if he had,
he wouldn't have run.

25:07.127 --> 25:09.562
I think we're gonna be here
for a while.

25:09.630 --> 25:11.697
Maybe. Maybe not.

25:17.804 --> 25:20.540
Yeah, I saw this plane
when I read Corey Rollins.

25:20.607 --> 25:23.510
- Yeah?
- Might explain the cigarettes.

25:25.077 --> 25:26.746
Let's see...

25:27.813 --> 25:29.381
Look at that.

25:41.899 --> 25:43.834
Who are all these women?

25:43.901 --> 25:46.470
I bet most of them didn't even
know he was taking their pictures.

25:46.538 --> 25:49.306
I wonder how many more women
wound up in walls somewhere.

25:49.374 --> 25:53.010
Even with all these pictures, it's
a leap to prove he killed anyone.

25:53.078 --> 25:54.978
He's still just
one of the suspects.

25:55.046 --> 25:58.014
We have to ID these women
and account for all of them.

25:58.082 --> 26:00.550
I'll give Rollins this:

26:00.618 --> 26:04.821
He was very organized.
There are times and dates on every single shot.

26:04.889 --> 26:06.990
Hold on here.

26:07.058 --> 26:08.792
Guys, check this out.

26:08.860 --> 26:10.692
A stack of them.

26:10.761 --> 26:12.527
Unreal.

26:12.595 --> 26:15.430
- Yeah, that's Stephanie.
- There's tonnes here.

26:17.734 --> 26:21.203
That's a week
before her disappearance.

26:22.771 --> 26:24.907
Even from the night
she was murdered.

26:24.975 --> 26:27.308
OK, so that proves
he was there that night.

26:27.376 --> 26:31.212
Yeah, but it doesn't actually tie
him to the murder itself. - Right.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.981
OK.

26:33.048 --> 26:35.549
You know what? You guys look
tired. Get out of here.

26:35.617 --> 26:37.318
Let me go through these.

26:37.386 --> 26:39.220
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Go find something to do.

26:39.288 --> 26:42.289
I got a date.
Call me if you get anything.

26:47.595 --> 26:50.030
You know,
I'm gonna go for a ride

26:50.098 --> 26:52.032
and check something out.
You got this?

26:52.100 --> 26:54.968
- I got it.
- All right.

27:02.274 --> 27:06.512
- Hey, Mr. McCallan. You got a second?
- You're a cop.

27:06.579 --> 27:10.283
- Special consultant, actually.
- That's a ballsy move coming down here

27:10.350 --> 27:13.352
by yourself. Now you're alone
with the big bad boogieman.

27:13.420 --> 27:15.687
Yeah. I just want
to ask you a question.

27:15.754 --> 27:19.590
First you set up my buddy
Fallon, and then you come here?

27:19.658 --> 27:22.894
Because, what are you, working
off someone's personal grudge?

27:22.962 --> 27:25.063
I'm just here
to find the truth.

27:25.131 --> 27:27.699
Oh, I see. OK, well,
I'll give you some truth, then.

27:27.766 --> 27:31.735
You are never gonna prove that I killed
that lawyer, because I didn't do it.

27:31.803 --> 27:35.139
So how did she end up
in a wall in your building?

27:36.207 --> 27:38.075
Someone's trying
to pin it on me.

27:38.143 --> 27:39.977
Why do you think that?

27:40.045 --> 27:41.979
The work that I was doing
on those buildings was being

27:42.047 --> 27:44.281
done on the down-low.
No permits.

27:44.349 --> 27:47.616
The only way somebody could have know
about it was if they were watching me.

27:47.684 --> 27:50.987
So you got some grudges?
Is someone trying to set you up? Is that it?

27:56.994 --> 27:58.895
I've made a few enemies
along the way.

27:58.963 --> 28:02.097
- On both sides of the law.
- Yeah.

28:02.165 --> 28:04.867
- That good enough for you?
- Thank you.

28:39.415 --> 28:41.101
So I was thinking.

28:41.168 --> 28:43.536
Maybe me and you could go
up north this weekend,

28:43.604 --> 28:45.972
get out of the city.
You know,

28:46.040 --> 28:48.474
a B&B maybe.

28:50.410 --> 28:52.878
Yeah, you know,
and just get some monkeys

28:52.946 --> 28:55.948
to run the bar, take off my clothes,
run through the streets naked,

28:56.016 --> 28:57.983
- light myself on fire.
- OK, OK.

28:58.051 --> 29:00.419
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

29:00.486 --> 29:03.522
It's just this case
I'm working.

29:03.589 --> 29:05.857
What?

29:06.675 --> 29:11.195
I guess I just got used
to being in charge of my team.

29:11.263 --> 29:14.698
And now I'm working
this higher level unit,

29:14.766 --> 29:17.969
which is great--I just,
I'm reporting to someone

29:18.037 --> 29:22.039
- and it just feels a bit like...
- Like a demotion?

29:22.106 --> 29:23.807
Yeah.

29:23.874 --> 29:25.809
Cut yourself some slack.
You said it:

29:25.876 --> 29:27.811
This is a high level unit.

29:27.878 --> 29:30.814
And you are there because
you are the best at what you do.

29:30.881 --> 29:32.582
And they all know that.

29:33.150 --> 29:36.920
That is some
smooth bartender rap.

29:36.988 --> 29:39.121
No, that was
Dr. Phil gone wrong.

29:39.189 --> 29:41.023
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:49.131 --> 29:51.633
- You're gonna answer that, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

29:53.570 --> 29:55.236
Yeah.

29:55.304 --> 29:58.273
OK, um,
I'm on my way. Yeah.

30:01.310 --> 30:05.180
- Nightcap?
- For sure.

30:07.116 --> 30:08.950
Naked.

30:09.018 --> 30:10.452
Of course.

30:12.219 --> 30:14.388
You're sure
there were four smokestacks?

30:14.456 --> 30:17.891
Yeah. I saw a distorted version of it
when I read Fallon, and then I saw it

30:17.959 --> 30:20.894
- more clearly when I read McCallan.
- Four smokestacks sounds like

30:20.962 --> 30:22.929
an old generating plant
in Lakeview.

30:22.998 --> 30:25.899
- Yeah, that's it.
- I mean, it's torn down now,

30:25.967 --> 30:28.067
but it would have been
standing at the time.

30:28.135 --> 30:30.470
The bodies of the dealers are
buried within sight of this.

30:30.537 --> 30:33.772
There's lots of industrial land out there.
Let's see if McCallan owned any property

30:33.840 --> 30:36.309
in that area. If we can connect
him to the other murders,

30:36.377 --> 30:38.577
maybe we can get him
to confess to Stephanie's.

30:39.145 --> 30:43.215
All right, I'm all over it.
Oh, uh, Walker's stewing in the interview room.

30:43.282 --> 30:46.151
Great. Come with me.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.154
Listen, I'm only gonna tell you this
one time: you never, ever freelance.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.156
That's how people end up dead.
Understood?

30:51.224 --> 30:53.791
All right, yeah.
It won't happen again.

30:53.859 --> 30:56.561
Nice job.

30:56.629 --> 30:59.296
I'm telling you,
I wasn't there.

30:59.364 --> 31:02.500
Then why was your car parked outside of
Stephanie's building the night she was killed?

31:02.568 --> 31:05.703
- I don't know. It's some mistake.
- No mistake. That's your car.

31:08.741 --> 31:12.143
Just 'cause somebody wrote a date on
the picture doesn't mean anything.

31:12.210 --> 31:13.978
<i>Other photos from the same
roll show Stephanie</i>

31:14.046 --> 31:16.246
<i>wearing the same outfit
that she was killed in.</i>

31:16.313 --> 31:18.481
Given your record,
the fact that

31:18.550 --> 31:22.185
Stephanie was breaking things off with you, the
judge and jury aren't even gonna need that.

31:22.253 --> 31:25.556
So you were there,
weren't you?

31:32.563 --> 31:35.998
But you weren't there
to hurt her, were you?

31:36.066 --> 31:40.703
No. We fought in the past,
but... I went there that night

31:40.771 --> 31:43.138
'cause we were gonna be
together again.

31:43.206 --> 31:45.107
What did you fight about?

31:47.044 --> 31:49.978
She was seeing
somebody else.

31:50.046 --> 31:52.047
You're sure about that?

31:52.115 --> 31:54.049
Yeah, even that night.

31:54.117 --> 31:57.486
She was wearing this piece of
jewellery--I'd never seen it before.

32:02.092 --> 32:04.692
It was carved silver.
Expensive.

32:04.759 --> 32:06.794
I never could have given it
to her.

32:06.861 --> 32:09.797
I don't know if she wore it to provoke me
or just to get things out in the open,

32:09.864 --> 32:12.800
but when I asked her where she got it,
she admitted she was seeing someone.

32:12.867 --> 32:15.336
- Do you know who this guy was?
- She didn't say.

32:15.404 --> 32:17.705
It didn't matter as long
as she was coming back to me.

32:17.772 --> 32:20.107
Still, it must have
made you mad.

32:20.174 --> 32:23.376
I told you. She said it was over,
and that's all I cared about.

32:23.444 --> 32:25.912
And you want us to believe
that you never hurt her?

32:25.980 --> 32:28.915
I swear.
The last I saw her,

32:28.983 --> 32:31.718
she said she was gonna break it
off with the guy that night.

32:31.785 --> 32:34.854
So... I left.

32:39.792 --> 32:42.728
I'm inclined to believe him.
Why would he kill her

32:42.795 --> 32:44.730
- if they were reconciling?
- And the make of his car

32:44.797 --> 32:47.500
doesn't match the carpet fibres
we found on Stephanie's body.

32:47.567 --> 32:51.336
So it would seem we're back looking
at McCallan as prime suspect.

32:51.403 --> 32:54.672
- Must be another way into him. - How would he
even get to Steph? Didn't you have him

32:54.740 --> 32:57.041
- under surveillance 24/7?
<i>- The only ways somebody</i>

32:57.109 --> 32:59.043
<i>could have known about it was
if they were watching me.</i>

32:59.111 --> 33:01.045
If there was this other guy,
that would explain something

33:01.113 --> 33:03.181
I've been having
a problem with here.

33:03.249 --> 33:06.151
There was no evidence of a lover--
no phone calls that weren't accounted for.

33:10.588 --> 33:14.324
- But there was motive.
- It was McCallan. It had to be.

33:20.197 --> 33:22.533
Let me know
when you actually get something.

33:29.338 --> 33:30.773
We have a problem.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.941
Thank you
for stating the obvious.

33:33.009 --> 33:35.411
No, I don't think
you understand.

33:35.979 --> 33:39.649
When I read Walker, I saw him giving
Stephanie a bunch of flowers,

33:39.716 --> 33:42.484
- and she put them in a glass vase.
- The murder weapon.

33:42.552 --> 33:45.620
I just read your friend
Morrissey here, and...

33:45.689 --> 33:48.957
he saw those exact same flowers
in the unbroken vase,

33:49.025 --> 33:52.594
which means that he was there
sometime between when Walker left

33:52.662 --> 33:54.629
and when she disappeared.

33:55.498 --> 33:56.731
What are you saying?

33:56.799 --> 33:58.733
I think he's the other man.

34:01.669 --> 34:03.404
That can't be.

34:03.971 --> 34:06.507
How would he know what the
flowers in the vase look like?

34:07.875 --> 34:11.312
Well, you said yourself,
your gift that plays tricks...

34:11.379 --> 34:13.346
Yes, but I can't
put the image in his head.

34:13.414 --> 34:16.016
He saw the flowers,
he saw the exact same vase.

34:16.083 --> 34:17.617
He was there.

34:17.685 --> 34:20.284
And with the surveillance
information he had on McCallan,

34:20.353 --> 34:23.222
he knew exactly where to dump
the body to incriminate him.

34:26.492 --> 34:28.460
We do have a problem.

34:29.277 --> 34:30.862
A big one.

34:34.592 --> 34:37.527
I checked with Metro
Organized Crime. Morrissey was

34:37.594 --> 34:39.695
one of the few people
with access to the location

34:39.763 --> 34:42.864
- of McCallan's off-the-books renovation project.
- There was also a call

34:42.934 --> 34:46.869
from Stephanie to Morrissey the night of her
disappearance, right after Walker's visit.

34:46.938 --> 34:50.373
Because they were working on a case together,
nobody thought it was out of the ordinary.

34:50.440 --> 34:53.574
In reality, she's calling him to set up
the meeting to break it off with him.

34:53.643 --> 34:55.744
So maybe he went
to go see her,

34:55.812 --> 34:59.415
he didn't take the break-up well, he flew
off the handle, and ended up killing her.

34:59.482 --> 35:02.017
And then buries the body
at McCallan's.

35:02.085 --> 35:04.019
These are great theories,
guys, but we don't have one

35:04.087 --> 35:07.522
hard solitary piece of evidence
proving anything. Maybe we do.

35:07.590 --> 35:10.591
Walker saw Stephanie wearing
a very distinct pendant--

35:10.659 --> 35:13.461
A metal star with sharp points
and a crystal inside of it.

35:13.528 --> 35:16.230
That could be where the marks
on her chest came from,

35:16.298 --> 35:18.566
but I didn't see any pendant
in the crime scene photos.

35:18.633 --> 35:21.602
No, and it wasn't with the body either, but
the killer could have taken it with him

35:21.670 --> 35:24.172
because he knew the police would
have connected it to him.

35:24.239 --> 35:26.573
Toby, can I get
a description?

35:26.640 --> 35:31.178
- Yeah, I got a very good read.
- Too bad your telepathic reads aren't admissible in court.

35:31.245 --> 35:33.680
It might not be necessary.
Is there any way you can get me

35:33.747 --> 35:35.782
access to Morrissey's
credit card records?

35:35.850 --> 35:40.954
Opening an official investigation into
a Crown Attorney, that's a big step.

35:41.021 --> 35:45.858
Who are you worried about here?
Your friend Morrissey or the woman he killed?

35:51.999 --> 35:53.866
Recognize it?

35:53.933 --> 35:57.869
Take a good
close look at it, Michael.

36:00.839 --> 36:02.474
Looks nice,

36:02.541 --> 36:04.675
- but I've never seen it before.
- That's odd because

36:04.743 --> 36:08.613
according to your credit card records, you
bought that just a little over eight years ago.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.948
The artisan who made it
recognized it instantly.

36:11.017 --> 36:13.450
It's a very expensive,
one-of-a-kind piece.

36:13.518 --> 36:15.486
It was for Stephanie,
wasn't it?

36:15.553 --> 36:19.589
Of course not. Who it was for
is none of your business.

36:19.657 --> 36:23.927
There are markings on Stephanie's body
in the exact pattern of that pendant.

36:23.995 --> 36:27.498
Her ex-boyfriend, Walker, also identified
it as the one she was wearing that night.

36:27.565 --> 36:29.632
There's no way
you can tie this to me.

36:33.970 --> 36:37.673
We found it in a drain
in your garage, so...

36:37.741 --> 36:40.309
We're gonna get
those prints.

36:40.377 --> 36:42.311
Maybe even some
of Stephanie's DNA.

36:42.379 --> 36:44.313
There were
also carpet fibres

36:44.381 --> 36:48.083
from your car's trunk,
late night phone calls...

36:48.151 --> 36:53.188
Not to mention your DNA on the body, a
partial print we're working to confirm...

36:53.256 --> 36:55.557
You know
where this is going, right?

36:58.361 --> 37:00.228
Can we have a minute?

37:10.872 --> 37:12.506
What happened, Michael?

37:19.246 --> 37:21.781
I went over
to her place...

37:21.848 --> 37:25.985
to tell her
that I was gonna leave my wife.

37:29.756 --> 37:32.492
I wanted us
to be together.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.993
I didn't want
to hide any more.

37:35.561 --> 37:37.996
Instead,
she told me it was over.

37:40.433 --> 37:41.866
That's when things...

37:41.934 --> 37:44.002
got crazy.

37:52.411 --> 37:54.479
Next thing I know...

37:57.116 --> 37:59.183
...she was on the floor.

38:02.154 --> 38:04.555
You know...

38:04.623 --> 38:08.225
I counted them up once--
over 200 cases I've been

38:08.292 --> 38:11.161
involved with that could
be called crimes of passion.

38:11.229 --> 38:14.598
There was a time when I...
I never believed in that concept.

38:14.665 --> 38:17.167
I never understood
how someone could get so angry

38:17.235 --> 38:19.702
they could lose all control.

38:22.972 --> 38:25.241
That all changed
that night.

38:33.650 --> 38:37.119
I'm sure Becky and her mother
will appreciate hearing that.

38:37.946 --> 38:40.087
- Alvin--
- You betrayed them.

38:41.056 --> 38:43.591
You betrayed me, Michael.

38:46.128 --> 38:48.563
Would you mind
coming with me?

39:02.177 --> 39:05.212
It's a good thing the jeweller was
able to make a copy of that pendant.

39:05.280 --> 39:08.482
Dev's getting a search warrant
for Morrissey's place right now.

39:08.550 --> 39:10.749
We'll get the real pendent
from the drain in his garage.

39:10.817 --> 39:13.586
Why didn't you read him
from the start?

39:13.654 --> 39:17.122
I don't read everybody.
Especially not people that we trust.

39:19.826 --> 39:22.428
You OK?
I always thought McCallan

39:22.496 --> 39:24.930
killed Stephanie
because of the case.

39:24.998 --> 39:28.900
But the thing is,
it was my case.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.768
She didn't want it.

39:32.705 --> 39:35.139
I convinced her there wasn't
gonna be a better chance

39:35.208 --> 39:37.108
to jump-start her career.

39:37.676 --> 39:41.312
And you felt guilty
ever since.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.447
You gotta let it go.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.118
And I that obvious, or are you
just reading me right now?

39:48.186 --> 39:50.087
I'm just listening.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.326
I think it's gonna take me a while
to get used to what you can do.

39:55.393 --> 40:00.129
Yeah. Yeah, I'm still trying.

40:00.197 --> 40:04.166
- This is crap. You got nothing. - We received
an anonymous tip suggesting we check out

40:04.235 --> 40:06.669
a property you owned
at the Four Sisters Power Plant.

40:06.737 --> 40:10.607
We did a little digging, and guess what we found?
The bodies of those missing dealers

40:10.674 --> 40:12.942
- you murdered.
- I had nothing to do with that.

40:13.009 --> 40:16.278
That's not what your boy Fallon's saying.
He's already cutting deals.

40:16.346 --> 40:19.948
No disappearing witnesses
this time. You're mine.

40:23.253 --> 40:26.688
So, tomorrow
you'll be in Africa.

40:26.756 --> 40:28.690
Technically,
it'll take a couple days--

40:28.758 --> 40:31.692
layovers, waiting for my bus,
another 10 hours on my bus--

40:31.760 --> 40:33.694
OK, I was trying
to be dramatic.

40:33.762 --> 40:37.465
- Oh. - Yeah. Listen, my shift's almost over.
Maybe I could, uh,

40:37.532 --> 40:40.234
come to your place,
have a proper goodbye?

40:40.302 --> 40:44.305
Uh... you know what, I would
love to, but I have packing...

40:44.373 --> 40:49.476
Right, yeah. Packing.
Packing can be stressful. Yeah.

40:50.043 --> 40:53.712
You know, I think this is
gonna be really good for us.

40:53.780 --> 40:56.548
I think it'll give us time
to see how we really feel.

40:56.616 --> 41:00.152
Yeah, time to think, right?
Exactly. - Yeah.

41:00.219 --> 41:02.154
I don't need time
to think, though.

41:02.221 --> 41:04.490
I know exactly
how I feel about you.

41:04.557 --> 41:08.026
And I'm not expecting
anything from you

41:08.094 --> 41:10.027
while you're gone, but...

41:10.095 --> 41:12.563
I will be here for you
when you get back.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.000
You don't have to do that.

41:16.067 --> 41:17.635
I know.

41:47.331 --> 41:49.264
You know the part
that I don't get?

41:49.333 --> 41:51.266
Why your car sucks
and mine doesn't?

41:51.335 --> 41:54.269
- I'm a lap ahead of you, brah.
- You're a lap behind, dude.

41:54.338 --> 41:57.572
No. Am I needy?
Am I a needy guy?

41:57.640 --> 41:59.574
You're whiny.
It's not sexy.

41:59.642 --> 42:01.909
When did I become
high maintenance?

42:01.977 --> 42:04.312
You fell in love, man.
Why do you think I'm single?

42:04.380 --> 42:07.048
- No, no, no!
- Nice.

42:07.115 --> 42:09.384
My driver's gonna need
life support. You want a beer?

42:09.452 --> 42:12.620
- Yup.
- Hey, so how was your first official cop case?

42:12.688 --> 42:14.822
Pretty good,
a few bumps.

42:14.889 --> 42:17.758
A little nervous. But I'm
getting the hang of it I think.

42:17.826 --> 42:19.827
Almost got beat up
by a hitman.

42:19.894 --> 42:22.229
Took down the boss' friend
for murder.

42:22.296 --> 42:25.733
- You know, things like that. - Well, suddenly
my day doesn't sound so bad after all.

42:25.800 --> 42:27.134
Cheers.

42:28.952 --> 42:30.302
Best five
out of seven?

42:30.371 --> 42:32.405
- All right.
- I'm Ryan Gosling.

42:32.473 --> 42:35.274
Why don't we make it interesting?
I do have an extra ticket to the Caribbean.

42:35.342 --> 42:38.578
- I'm not sleeping in the same bed with you.
- I think that's assumed.

42:38.645 --> 42:41.981
- All right.
- Three, two, one.

42:42.048 --> 42:43.249
Aww!
