00:01.000 --> 00:02.628
<i>[Marc] Previously on Ugly Betty:</i>

00:02.702 --> 00:06.138
- What was your first impression of me?
- Um... [mock scream]

00:06.206 --> 00:08.470
- What is this?
- A tracking device.

00:08.541 --> 00:11.442
I will know where you are,
every minute of every day.

00:11.511 --> 00:14.446
I can't spend time with you
and your girlfriend.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.845
What does that make us?

00:15.915 --> 00:18.850
- People who work in the same building.
- Oh.

00:18.918 --> 00:22.877
- Your family is falling apart.
- My family is coming together.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.981
He said if I went through
with the surgery,

00:25.058 --> 00:27.526
I'd lose everything.
He'd rather I were dead.

00:27.627 --> 00:31.256
You're here because of me.
Because of what I did.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.665
I'm turning myself in.

00:35.368 --> 00:38.235
<i>I'm reporting live
outside of Meade Publications,</i>

00:38.304 --> 00:41.239
<i>where Bradford Meade
is expected to return to work tomorrow</i>

00:41.307 --> 00:42.934
<i>after his release from prison.</i>

00:43.009 --> 00:46.775
<i>Arrested for the murder of Fey Sommers,
all charges against him were dropped</i>

00:46.846 --> 00:50.976
<i>after his wife, Claire Meade,
turned herself in late last night.</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:53.952
<i>Now, let's get some reactions
from some of the employees.</i>

00:54.020 --> 00:57.547
<i>- Excuse me. Miss? Miss?
- No comment! No comment!</i>

00:57.624 --> 00:59.353
<i>Ow!</i>

01:02.462 --> 01:04.953
<i>No comment! No comment! Ow!</i>

01:05.932 --> 01:08.093
[Justin laughs]

01:08.868 --> 01:11.166
<i>- [thud]
- [Betty over TV] Ow!</i>

01:11.237 --> 01:13.671
<i>- [Tape rewinding]
- [Betty over TV] Ow!</i>

01:13.740 --> 01:16.231
<i>- [Justin chuckles]
- [Betty over TV] Ow!</i>

01:16.309 --> 01:18.937
<i>- [Betty over TV] Ow!
- Hilda!</i>

01:19.012 --> 01:20.445
- Justin!
- I'm sorry!

01:20.513 --> 01:22.310
It just gets funnier every time.

01:22.382 --> 01:25.408
- Would you just get ready for school?
- Fine!

01:26.486 --> 01:27.714
[Sighs]

01:28.555 --> 01:33.015
So how are you doing anyway?
And don't say "no comment."

01:33.093 --> 01:34.822
I don't know.

01:34.894 --> 01:38.193
Ever since Ms. Meade's arrest,
I just can't help but feel guilty.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.461
I was the one who talked her into
turning herself in.

01:41.534 --> 01:45.664
Hey, you didn't talk her into anything.
She did what she felt she had to do.

01:45.738 --> 01:47.296
How's Daniel handling this?

01:47.373 --> 01:50.809
He and Alexis aren't speaking.
Alexis and his father aren't speaking,

01:50.877 --> 01:54.313
and his mother is being detoxed
before she can be arraigned.

01:54.380 --> 01:58.146
See, it really makes you appreciate
coming from a nice, normal family.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.742
[Alarm wailing]

01:59.819 --> 02:02.947
Papi, what part of "house arrest"
don't you understand?

02:03.022 --> 02:05.286
I just went out two feet
to get the paper!

02:05.358 --> 02:07.724
- [Phone ringing]
- I think that's for you.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.563
- Yes, Constance.
- [Alarm continues]

02:12.632 --> 02:15.931
I just stepped out my front door.
I wasn't fleeing the country!

02:16.002 --> 02:18.664
OK. I'm back inside now. Happy?

02:18.738 --> 02:20.171
[Alarm stops]

02:20.240 --> 02:22.765
Dad, it's only four more weeks
till your court date.

02:22.842 --> 02:27.040
I can't live like a prisoner four more
weeks. I'm going stir-crazy in here!

02:28.081 --> 02:30.447
I'm starting not to remember
the feel of rain,

02:30.517 --> 02:33.179
the smell of freshly mowed grass.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.278
Papi, we live in Jackson Heights.

02:35.355 --> 02:38.017
The grass smells like fried onions.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.556
I got the message, I'll definitely
be there at 9:00 on the dot.

02:42.629 --> 02:44.062
[Gasps]

02:44.130 --> 02:45.995
I waited an hour and a half to do that.

02:46.065 --> 02:49.501
I just came to get my things before...

02:50.603 --> 02:53.128
- I'll come back later.
- No. No, no.

02:53.740 --> 02:57.437
We still haven't had our beautiful
father-son reconciliation.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.978
Last time I saw you,
things were so rushed.

03:00.046 --> 03:02.810
With you having me arrested and all.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.441
So...

03:05.518 --> 03:08.453
...this is the life
you wanted so badly?

03:08.521 --> 03:11.854
Actually, in the life I wanted,
you were behind bars.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.985
And in the life I wanted,
you were still a man.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.827
You remember making me this?
You were six.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.024
After you disappeared,

03:22.101 --> 03:25.070
I'd look at it to remind myself
of the son that I'd lost.

03:25.138 --> 03:28.039
Now it reminds me
of the son I wish I'd never had.

03:31.744 --> 03:33.268
You and I...

03:33.880 --> 03:38.180
...we're finished.
- We were finished a long time ago.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.714
Hey, I've been looking for you.
Look what I just scored.

03:45.792 --> 03:48.761
New Prada store's opening tonight
and Steve Aoki's DJ'ing.

03:48.828 --> 03:51.353
- Drinks beforehand?
- I can't, I have plans.

03:51.431 --> 03:52.659
- Who is he?
- My mother.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.962
She's in town for another
stupid cat show.

03:55.034 --> 03:57.798
It's disgusting,
her and a bunch of fancy pussycats.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.735
Don't worry. I'll skip Prada.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.104
Your girlfriend is reporting for duty.

04:02.175 --> 04:06.578
- Where are the 3 of us going to dinner?
- Actually, you're not coming.

04:06.646 --> 04:09.740
But it's your mother.
I'm the love of your life, remember?

04:09.816 --> 04:13.445
You're released from beard duty.
Consider yourself shaved.

04:13.519 --> 04:15.077
Wait, what are you saying?

04:15.154 --> 04:18.214
Did you actually tell your mother
that you are a ho...

04:18.291 --> 04:19.849
No! It's just...

04:20.159 --> 04:23.526
I've been telling her you're
my girlfriend three years now, and...

04:23.596 --> 04:25.689
...she's pressuring me
to buy the cow.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.700
So you're saying we're over?
And I'm fat?

04:28.768 --> 04:30.736
No! Just over.

04:30.803 --> 04:32.566
Just like that?

04:32.639 --> 04:36.268
Sweetie, it's not you, it's me.

04:36.342 --> 04:38.367
You are damn right that it's you!

04:38.444 --> 04:41.174
I'm the best pretend girlfriend
you'll ever have.

04:41.247 --> 04:42.578
Mandy! [scoffs]

04:42.649 --> 04:45.482
We'll always have
that fake pregnancy scare!

04:45.551 --> 04:50.147
Oh, that was a real scare, you idiot.
It just wasn't yours!

04:58.564 --> 05:00.395
How are you feeling?

05:00.466 --> 05:05.335
Well, I've had better Mondays.
And better jewelry.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.037
The shakes haven't started yet,

05:09.108 --> 05:12.566
but the sweating
and the nightmares are a delight.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.876
Oh, and they say
I should be moving to the prison

05:15.948 --> 05:17.677
by the end of the week.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.684
You should have let me stay in there.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.820
I'm scared.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.551
I'm here for you.

05:27.260 --> 05:31.162
- I hope you still are, after...
- After what?

05:32.365 --> 05:34.390
Hey. How are you feeling?

05:36.202 --> 05:39.137
I've been talking with the lawyers
and they think if we...

05:39.205 --> 05:41.435
That's not why I called you here.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.667
What's going on?

05:42.742 --> 05:45.040
Your father tried to fire Alexis today.

05:45.111 --> 05:48.205
- Tried? I did.
- But you can't.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.681
She's your child,
and she's your sister.

05:51.484 --> 05:54.942
Now, I am probably going away
for a very long time,

05:55.021 --> 05:56.852
and I want you all to be a family.

05:56.923 --> 05:59.949
I don't think Alex wants
to be part of any family, Mom.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.052
Alexis! And she'll never be
part of a family

06:03.129 --> 06:05.427
if you keep pushing her away.

06:06.132 --> 06:09.158
<i>Which is why I've convinced her
to help you run Mode.</i>

06:09.235 --> 06:11.897
- Is she on morphine?
- I wish.

06:11.971 --> 06:16.305
<i>Don't be ridiculous, Claire. I decide
who works for my companies. I own Mode.</i>

06:16.376 --> 06:20.244
Actually, dear,
you own Meade Publications.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.076
Apparently, you've forgotten.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.877
<i>I own Mode.</i>

06:27.587 --> 06:30.249
Your mother owns this magazine?
Since when?

06:30.323 --> 06:33.349
Since my dad needed a tax shelter
and put it in her name.

06:33.426 --> 06:36.190
So now she insists
Alex and I be co-editors-in-chief

06:36.262 --> 06:38.389
and there's nothing
anyone can do about it.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.125
Maybe that's not a bad thing.

06:40.199 --> 06:42.599
You and Alexis can get
to know each other again.

06:42.668 --> 06:44.898
And, now you only have to do
half the work.

06:44.971 --> 06:48.168
Half? Betty,
there's no "half" with Alex.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.540
You put us side-by-side in anything,
she always has to win.

06:52.845 --> 06:55.837
<i>[Daniel] When we went jogging
every morning it would be great.</i>

06:55.915 --> 07:00.784
<i>But then at the very end, every time,
he always had to pull ahead.</i>

07:00.853 --> 07:03.014
<i>Just to remind me he could.</i>

07:03.089 --> 07:04.351
Yes!

07:10.129 --> 07:13.565
Daniel, you've done a great job
running this magazine.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.898
I know you can win this race.
It's like the tortoise and the hare...

07:16.969 --> 07:21.770
OK, I'm going to figure it out.
You can cross my pep talk off your list.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.006
There will be more.

07:26.913 --> 07:30.440
So, both of you are editors-in-chief?

07:30.516 --> 07:35.283
Alexis is an editor-in-chief.
Daniel is an editor-in-chief.

07:35.354 --> 07:38.983
Seems like everyone in
the room is an editor-in-chief...

07:39.058 --> 07:42.619
...except for me.
- And me.

07:42.695 --> 07:45.892
OK. Here's how we're gonna
split up responsibilities.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.263
Wilhelmina, you are still
Creative Director.

07:48.334 --> 07:52.202
I'll write the Letter from the Editor
and have final say on the book.

07:52.271 --> 07:55.434
- Wow, look at the big man in charge.
- [Daniel] Somebody has to be.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.635
Not all of us have time
to fake our own death,

07:57.710 --> 07:59.405
disappear for two years.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.879
Oh, God. Are you still
singing that old song?

08:01.948 --> 08:05.247
Daniel, you can be the boss
of everything for all I care.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.481
I don't want anything to do
with you, Dad or this magazine.

08:08.554 --> 08:09.612
[Daniel] Really?

08:10.957 --> 08:12.822
That's not what you told Mom, is it?

08:12.892 --> 08:16.692
Just stop, Daniel. I'm done.
Have fun with your little magazine.

08:16.762 --> 08:19.094
I, for one, have much bigger dreams.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.099
Like what? A uterus?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.964
You can say it,
but can you spell it?

08:23.035 --> 08:24.866
Do I need to be in this meeting?

08:25.872 --> 08:27.999
This meeting's over.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.946
They really did take your balls away
with that operation, didn't they?

08:34.013 --> 08:36.311
- Excuse me?
- What is wrong with you?

08:36.381 --> 08:39.351
You're giving Bradford
exactly what he wants.

08:39.418 --> 08:42.251
- He won! Game over.
- Not necessarily.

08:42.321 --> 08:45.757
Bradford doesn't want you
anywhere near this magazine, right?

08:45.825 --> 08:49.226
So, splash yourself all over it!

08:49.295 --> 08:51.855
Your father will die of shame.

08:51.931 --> 08:55.799
He wouldn't die. Stroke, maybe.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.665
<i>Alexis, make Mode your own.</i>

08:57.737 --> 09:00.934
You approve the book, you write
the Letter from the Editor.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.703
Show the industry
and your father who's in charge.

09:03.776 --> 09:05.744
You mean, take it away from Daniel?

09:05.811 --> 09:08.439
- Do you care?
- Not really.

09:09.448 --> 09:15.250
Well, you really want to do this job,
you should have an appropriate office...

09:16.322 --> 09:17.448
...like this one.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.361
This is our new office?
It has fluorescent lighting.

09:28.434 --> 09:31.130
I will not be looked at
under this merciless glare.

09:31.203 --> 09:34.229
Patience, Blanche. It's only temporary.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.901
The minute Daniel sees her
as a real threat,

09:36.976 --> 09:38.773
they'll be at each other's throats

09:38.844 --> 09:41.176
and then I'll have my pick
of any office I want.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.978
Thank God, you have a new plan.
We shall overcome, girlfriend.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.315
- You did not just say that.
- [Stammers]

09:47.386 --> 09:49.479
- [Cell phone rings]
- [Gasps]

09:49.555 --> 09:52.820
Oh, my God.
Mommy, in the building.

09:52.892 --> 09:54.553
[Elevator dings]

10:02.201 --> 10:04.863
[Cat meows, hisses]

10:04.937 --> 10:07.030
- [Loud hiss]
- [Hisses]

10:07.106 --> 10:08.767
[Cat growls]

10:09.408 --> 10:10.898
Hello, Amanda.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.911
Hi, Mama Weiner.

10:13.679 --> 10:17.376
Dear, I hate to be rude, but now
that you've broken Marc's heart

10:17.450 --> 10:21.750
with your indiscretions,
you should go back to Mrs. Weiner.

10:21.821 --> 10:24.688
- Indiscretions?
- Marc told me about the other men

10:24.757 --> 10:26.088
and women.

10:26.158 --> 10:28.592
Drug addiction makes you do
strange things.

10:28.661 --> 10:33.394
But Marc says you're working on that,
one day at a time.

10:33.466 --> 10:37.630
Really?
Marc told you all of that, did he?

10:37.703 --> 10:38.692
Mom!

10:38.771 --> 10:41.934
- There's my Marky Marc!
- Hi!

10:42.008 --> 10:43.771
[Loud kisses]

10:44.176 --> 10:47.509
I thought you were going to the cat show
then we were going to dinner?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.138
I had a "cat-tastrophy."

10:49.215 --> 10:52.275
Lady Buttons of Camelot
lost a jewel on her collar.

10:52.351 --> 10:54.717
That's a ten point penalty
for appearance.

10:54.787 --> 10:57.085
Can one of your fashion people fix it?

10:57.156 --> 10:58.748
Oh, of course!

10:58.824 --> 11:00.985
Fashion person... help?

11:01.060 --> 11:02.857
I would be happy to.

11:02.928 --> 11:06.227
I just hope my drug and sex
addictions don't get in the way.

11:06.298 --> 11:09.961
Oh, Mom, why don't you go to the
cafeteria and get some lunch

11:10.036 --> 11:11.765
and I'll bring the collar to you.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.329
Wait! Marc, aren't you going to
introduce your mom to your new love,

11:15.408 --> 11:18.502
in whose bosom you found comfort
after dating a skank like me?

11:18.577 --> 11:20.477
You're dating someone new?

11:20.546 --> 11:23.344
Oh, look! And here she is.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.010
This is Marc's new girlfriend, Betty.

11:26.852 --> 11:30.379
Girlfriend? That's a good one, Amanda.

11:30.456 --> 11:32.617
What's so funny?

11:32.692 --> 11:35.252
Well, you know, because Marc's...

11:37.596 --> 11:39.029
[gags]

11:41.000 --> 11:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:54.080 --> 11:57.413
[Gags, groans]

11:58.818 --> 12:00.979
You haven't told your mom you're gay?

12:01.754 --> 12:03.415
I mean, isn't it a little...

12:03.489 --> 12:07.858
I don't know... I...
It's just that you're so... sparkly.

12:07.927 --> 12:10.828
She visits twice a year,
she sees what she wants to see.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.763
I can't believe I'm asking you this.
I need your help.

12:14.366 --> 12:17.824
You need my help? Hmm.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.394
The girl you've tortured
for the last six months.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.873
I think "tortured" is a little severe.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.137
My second day,
you tricked me into eating glue

12:25.211 --> 12:27.839
by telling me it was white chocolate.
I could've died.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.313
I only let you eat two pieces.
Come on, Betty.

12:30.382 --> 12:32.316
It would really mean a lot to my mother.

12:34.787 --> 12:38.382
Lady Buttons of Camelot has a
real shot in the show ring today.

12:38.457 --> 12:41.085
Look at her!
She's having a really good fur day.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.889
I'm not dating your kid anymore,

12:42.962 --> 12:45.362
so I don't have to listen
to the "cat-chat."

12:45.431 --> 12:48.867
Marc's right. You are cranky
when you don't get your fix.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.961
[Cell phone rings]

12:54.573 --> 12:58.236
<i>Oh, look at this. It's Betty's papi.</i>

12:58.310 --> 13:01.108
- You should really talk to him.
- Won't Betty mind?

13:01.180 --> 13:04.843
She hasn't found the right time
to tell her father she's dating Marc.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.078
You could really help them out.

13:08.854 --> 13:11.345
Hi, this is Jean Weiner.

13:11.423 --> 13:14.119
All you have to do
is come stand next to me

13:14.193 --> 13:17.185
and let me tell my mom
that we're... dating.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.231
It's crazy.
She would never believe us.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.631
OK, if you do this for me...

13:22.701 --> 13:25.329
...l'll give you information
to save your boss's job.

13:25.404 --> 13:27.565
What? Why? What do you know?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.005
Uh-uh. You help me first.

13:29.074 --> 13:31.668
[Amanda laughs]

13:31.744 --> 13:34.304
So, how's the happy couple?

13:34.380 --> 13:37.247
Oh, laugh, clown, laugh.

13:37.316 --> 13:41.184
But I am showing everyone
copies of your "modeling" photos.

13:41.253 --> 13:44.780
OK, those were tasteful.
And he told me he loved me.

13:44.857 --> 13:48.020
Besides, you're not gonna have time
to show anyone anything.

13:48.093 --> 13:50.994
- Your mom just talked to Betty's dad.
- She what?

13:51.063 --> 13:53.964
And you're all having dinner tonight
at the Casa de Suarez.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.524
[Laughs] Ta!

13:56.836 --> 13:59.031
This better be
some good information, Marc.

13:59.104 --> 14:03.006
- You're ruining meatloaf night.
- Wait, what?

14:03.075 --> 14:06.169
Alexis wants to take over the company
and push you out.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.713
- That's what Marc said.
- Is Alex in his office?

14:08.781 --> 14:10.339
Yes, she is.

14:10.416 --> 14:13.180
Why would Marc tell you that?
Didn't he make you eat glue?

14:13.252 --> 14:15.584
Yeah, that was before.
I'm his girlfriend now.

14:15.654 --> 14:18.179
- His what?
- The things I do for you.

14:20.926 --> 14:24.191
Daniel Meade. Nick Pepper,
Ms. Meade's new assistant.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.790
I've followed your career
since I graduated from Cornell.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.836
I want to be you in five years.

14:30.903 --> 14:33.497
Buy more expensive ties,
sleep with a few models,

14:33.572 --> 14:35.733
- and you're halfway there, buddy.
- Yes!

14:37.576 --> 14:42.013
So, new office, new assistant.
Is that what you meant by,

14:42.081 --> 14:44.345
"I don't want a thing to do
with this magazine?"

14:44.416 --> 14:45.883
Oh, calm down, Daniel.

14:45.951 --> 14:49.318
I've been thinking about
what you said, and...

14:49.388 --> 14:51.049
I just can't lie to Mom again.

14:51.123 --> 14:55.253
If us working together makes her happy
then I think we should give it a try.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.817
I'll even follow your lead.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.957
And Lucy's actually gonna let
Charlie Brown kick the football, right?

15:01.033 --> 15:04.901
You're not fooling me, Alexis. I'm not
the kid brother you used to push around.

15:04.970 --> 15:07.871
And I'm not your
big brother anymore, clearly!

15:07.940 --> 15:12.775
Look, can we not make this about us?
This is about Mom.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.410
If I agree...

15:15.481 --> 15:18.245
...that wouldn't mean
I'm working for you, understood?

15:18.317 --> 15:21.184
I know! Fifty-fifty.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.483
You want me to pinky-swear?

15:23.555 --> 15:25.420
OK, so what can I do?

15:25.491 --> 15:29.359
Well, this issue is pretty much
put to bed, so...

15:29.428 --> 15:32.864
I haven't written
the Letter from the Editor yet.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.456
Maybe you can write one too.

15:34.533 --> 15:37.366
I'll print them side-by-side.
How about that?

15:37.436 --> 15:41.338
- Side-by-side?
- Yes, Alex. It's called "sharing."

15:41.407 --> 15:43.398
You mean, like Katie Myers?

15:44.243 --> 15:47.303
That wasn't so much "sharing"
as you "stealing my girlfriend."

15:47.379 --> 15:49.210
OK, bad example.

15:49.281 --> 15:53.809
I need 400 words by tomorrow morning.
We take the book to press by noon.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.324
Nick!

16:02.895 --> 16:06.922
Cancel your paintball game
or whatever it is you do after work.

16:06.999 --> 16:10.298
We've got a lot to do if we're
to get this to the printers by midnight.

16:10.369 --> 16:11.927
Didn't Daniel say noon?

16:12.004 --> 16:16.065
Daniel also thinks I'm gonna be
sharing this job fifty-fifty.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.403
You're not?

16:17.476 --> 16:22.709
Honey, I didn't share Katie Myers
and I'm not gonna share this magazine.

16:22.781 --> 16:25.272
There's my issue, and there's Daniel's.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.819
And Daniel's is never gonna see
the light of day.

16:27.886 --> 16:30.081
Dude, you're awesome.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.386
Dude, you haven't seen anything yet.

16:37.429 --> 16:40.830
OK, we got to focus. We got to sit
through dinner with my mother,

16:40.899 --> 16:43.129
we have to know everything
about each other.

16:43.202 --> 16:45.534
- You're from the Philippines, right?
- Queens!

16:45.604 --> 16:48.038
Don't give me that look.
They both end in "eens."

16:48.107 --> 16:51.907
We met when I made
a bet with my friends

16:51.977 --> 16:54.810
that I could turn you from
an ugly duckling into a swan.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.347
<i>Marc, that's She's All That.</i>

16:56.415 --> 16:58.906
No, in that movie
she actually became beautiful.

16:58.984 --> 17:02.317
I fell in love with you because
of the whole "inner beauty" crap.

17:02.388 --> 17:04.549
OK, let's move to the flash cards.

17:04.623 --> 17:06.318
I hope you studied.

17:07.626 --> 17:10.720
- What's my favorite boy band?
- 'N Sync!

17:10.796 --> 17:13.356
<i>- What's my favorite musical?
- High School Musical!</i>

17:13.432 --> 17:16.731
- Where do I get my Mystic Tan?
- Sunset Tan on 48th!

17:16.801 --> 17:19.794
Will these answers really
convince your mom you're straight?

17:19.872 --> 17:23.329
Straight guys Mystic Tan.
Hello, Tom Cruise. OK, now you go.

17:23.541 --> 17:26.375
- Who's Justin?
- Pass.

17:26.444 --> 17:29.903
- He's my nephew, you've met him.
- Pass. I'll never remember that!

17:29.982 --> 17:30.971
How old am I?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.142
- 32.
- 22!

17:32.217 --> 17:34.708
- Really?
- Yes! Thank you for that.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.881
- My favorite flowers?
- [Henry] Pink Gerber daisies

17:38.757 --> 17:41.021
Henry? Hi.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.220
Just dropping off paychecks.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.055
How have you been?

17:45.130 --> 17:48.156
Good, good. How's Charlie?

17:48.233 --> 17:51.327
- Good. She's good.
- OK, OK, Betty.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.631
We gotta finish this.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.773
- Favorite pizza toppings?
- Goat cheese and capers!

17:56.842 --> 18:00.403
- Pepperoni, mushroom.
- Hey, who's girlfriend is she? Beat it!

18:00.479 --> 18:02.947
I'm sorry.
I'm just helping him with something.

18:03.015 --> 18:06.746
- Well, it was nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

18:09.955 --> 18:12.253
- Favorite Disney Princess?
- Oh, Mulan.

18:12.324 --> 18:15.623
Cinderella. Her mother always
read that to her before bed.

18:17.796 --> 18:19.787
<i>[Peaches: Boys Wanna be Her]</i>

18:48.227 --> 18:49.489
OK, I think you've got it.

18:49.561 --> 18:52.086
Print up those proofs
and get them to graphics ASAP.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.962
We have a midnight deadline.
Let's move!

18:55.033 --> 18:57.934
I see someone's enjoying her new role.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.731
Love what you did with the office.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.772
And I read your letter for the magazine.

19:03.842 --> 19:07.243
Brilliant! A scathing indictment
of dear ol' Dad.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.645
And you're looking at the new cover.
Think Daddy will like it?

19:10.716 --> 19:13.913
He is a breast man. Don't know
whether he'll like them on his son.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.180
Perfect!

19:15.254 --> 19:19.315
Is it safe to assume that Daniel
is not aware of any of this?

19:19.391 --> 19:21.723
Oh, please. Daniel's clueless.

19:21.793 --> 19:25.160
He won't even know this is happening
until the issue hits the stands.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.967
I have to go change my clothes.
I have a million things to do.

19:32.604 --> 19:36.700
- It's almost scary how easy this is.
- You are evil.

19:38.710 --> 19:41.304
I'm so going as you for Halloween!

19:50.789 --> 19:54.316
- I read your Letter from the Editor.
- And?

19:54.393 --> 19:56.020
- It's good!
- Uh-oh.

19:56.094 --> 19:59.291
Your voice got all high, like when
I ask you to stay late and you say,

19:59.364 --> 20:03.926
- "I don't mind."
- No. It's a good letter, it's just...

20:04.770 --> 20:08.001
- It's about shoes!
- This is a fashion magazine, right?

20:08.073 --> 20:10.041
<i>But this isn't just any issue of Mode.</i>

20:10.108 --> 20:11.973
With everything that's been going on,

20:12.044 --> 20:15.036
people are gonna be looking to this
as your public statement.

20:15.147 --> 20:18.275
Don't you think you should
write something a little bit more...

20:18.350 --> 20:20.716
...personal? Maybe you could...

20:20.786 --> 20:23.755
- I can't.
- Is it too painful?

20:23.822 --> 20:26.689
No. I mean, literally, I can't...

20:27.960 --> 20:30.360
I don't know how to write
a letter like that.

20:30.429 --> 20:33.159
Daniel, I read your letter every month.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.895
It's always funny and smart and...

20:36.969 --> 20:39.904
It's one of the things that makes you
such an amazing editor.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.941
I don't exactly write those letters.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.272
You know Jeremy from Features?

20:46.178 --> 20:49.773
He kinda writes them, and I...
I sign my name to them.

20:49.848 --> 20:52.009
That's dishonest.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.882
How is your boyfriend, Marc, doing?

20:54.953 --> 20:57.547
- Point taken.
- I am not a writer, Betty.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.921
I can't do this. I'm barely an editor.

20:59.992 --> 21:04.827
Daniel, you get a magazine out
every month and you do an amazing job.

21:04.896 --> 21:07.296
And you'll do an amazing job
on this letter, too.

21:07.366 --> 21:09.391
You just have to write from the heart.

21:09.468 --> 21:13.097
You really want your letter to be about
how the pilgrim buckle is back?

21:13.171 --> 21:14.399
Well, it is.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.673
You can do this.

21:26.518 --> 21:29.146
- [Doorbell rings]
- [Betty sighs]

21:31.189 --> 21:34.124
There's my little enchilada.

21:34.192 --> 21:38.185
- Sorry we're late.
- Oh, it's not a problem... baby.

21:41.533 --> 21:45.162
It's my fault. The cat was acting up,
I couldn't leave her in the hotel.

21:46.605 --> 21:49.631
How did Miss Lady Buttons of Camelot
do in the show today?

21:49.708 --> 21:53.769
Last place. I stripped away her title.
Her name's just Buttons now.

21:53.845 --> 21:57.679
Let's just sit down real fast, eat that
dinner and we'll be out of here.

21:58.650 --> 22:02.746
<i>- Hey, Mr. Suarez.
- Call me Papi.</i>

22:02.821 --> 22:03.845
- Too much?
- Mmm-hmm.

22:03.922 --> 22:05.753
- This is my mom, Jean Weiner.
- Hi.

22:05.824 --> 22:08.315
Yes, we talked on the phone.
I love your home.

22:08.393 --> 22:11.089
<i>It's so... festivo!</i>

22:11.163 --> 22:15.293
There they are. Hello, hi!

22:15.367 --> 22:17.494
I'm Hilda, Betty's sister.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.205
Can you believe these two crazy kids?
So in love!

22:23.475 --> 22:26.273
- Let me take your things for you.
- Oh, thank you.

22:28.113 --> 22:29.603
What is she doing here?

22:29.681 --> 22:32.206
"She" wouldn't miss this for the world.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.987
- She lives here.
- "She lives here."

22:58.710 --> 22:59.699
Taquito,

22:59.778 --> 23:03.976
remember that time we drove upstate
to look at the leaves?

23:04.049 --> 23:07.917
Oh, yes! And we listened
to 'N Sync the whole way up

23:07.986 --> 23:10.216
because that's Marc's favorite band.

23:10.288 --> 23:12.256
I know that because I am his boyfriend.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.758
I mean, he's my girlfriend. I mean...

23:15.594 --> 23:20.054
So, Miss Weiner, tell us. How did you
get started in cat shows?

23:20.132 --> 23:21.861
Oh, well it was just fun at first.

23:21.933 --> 23:24.800
I had a hairless Sphynx
named Mr. Meowington

23:24.870 --> 23:26.735
who I entered in a local pageant.

23:26.805 --> 23:29.774
For his talent competition
he flushed a toilet.

23:31.843 --> 23:34.141
See, even a cat
can remember to do it.

23:34.212 --> 23:36.976
[Mrs. Weiner] Betty, you have
the same sense of humor as

23:37.048 --> 23:41.041
Marc's old roommate Chuck.
Honey, do you ever see Chuck?

23:41.119 --> 23:46.614
I don't want to talk about him.
We just... sort of lost touch.

23:46.691 --> 23:49.455
[Mrs. Weiner] He was so handsome,
and they were so close.

23:49.528 --> 23:52.929
We weren't that close!
We were just poker buddies.

23:52.998 --> 23:54.863
I'm guessing a lot of hold 'em.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.629
So how long have you two
been going out?

23:57.869 --> 23:59.234
- Six months.
- Three months.

23:59.304 --> 24:01.568
I mean six months.
It has been six months,

24:01.640 --> 24:03.767
it just feels like three months.

24:03.842 --> 24:06.640
<i>Our first date,
we watched High School Musical</i>

24:06.711 --> 24:09.373
because that's Marc's favorite musical,

24:09.448 --> 24:11.075
and I know that.

24:13.652 --> 24:16.052
Would you guys excuse us
for just a minute?

24:16.121 --> 24:19.579
Treasure, can I see you
up in my room?

24:23.094 --> 24:25.221
Hey, keep that door open!

24:25.297 --> 24:28.198
Oh... [chuckles]

24:32.838 --> 24:36.035
So this is where the tragic happens.

24:36.107 --> 24:38.541
Marc, we can't do this anymore. Marc!

24:38.610 --> 24:42.569
We are not convincing anybody.
I keep waiting for Mr. Roper to show up.

24:42.647 --> 24:45.115
You agreed to this.
I helped you with Daniel.

24:45.183 --> 24:48.584
You're a grown man. Tell her the truth.
She might surprise you.

24:48.653 --> 24:53.352
Look what happened with Lady Buttons,
and that was just over a stupid ribbon!

24:53.425 --> 24:57.623
I'm her child. Her favorite.
I can't disappoint her.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.969
How do you tell someone after ten years
that none of it's been real?

25:13.645 --> 25:17.547
If I tell her the truth now,
then we've got nothing.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.516
What do you have now?

25:19.584 --> 25:23.520
Two visits and Christmas?
That's not a relationship.

25:23.588 --> 25:26.955
- It's too late.
- No, it's not.

25:27.025 --> 25:31.121
Marc, you have a mother.
And she is downstairs,

25:31.196 --> 25:33.756
and you have a chance
to make her part of your life.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.925
Do you know
what I would give for that?

25:38.537 --> 25:40.164
My family's not your family, OK?

25:41.239 --> 25:44.504
So, let's turn that mustache
upside down,

25:44.576 --> 25:47.943
go downstairs and finish dinner
and then we'll be out of here!

25:48.013 --> 25:51.346
OK, but let's bring it back down
to a man's voice.

25:53.952 --> 25:57.353
Hi, Aunt Betty. Hi, Uncle Marc.

25:58.089 --> 26:01.149
- What's your son doing here?
- Nephew!

26:01.226 --> 26:03.956
Sorry. Justin's supposed
to be with his father,

26:04.029 --> 26:06.793
but don't worry,
I had a chat with him, he's onboard.

26:06.865 --> 26:09.265
Dad tried to take me out for fast food.

26:09.334 --> 26:12.701
Chicken nuggets are 15 points.
It's almost bathing suit season!

26:12.771 --> 26:14.705
All right, just help clear the plates?

26:14.773 --> 26:18.106
So, Hilda, you're a single mom.
That must be hard.

26:18.176 --> 26:20.269
How long ago did you
and your husband split?

26:20.345 --> 26:22.506
We were never
actually married, you know.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.811
Prom Night,
condom breaks, long story.

26:26.017 --> 26:28.485
Actually not. That's pretty much it.

26:29.487 --> 26:32.354
- That's a lot of information.
- [Ignacio] I'll get that.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.257
Betty, look what I silk-screened
in our class today.

26:35.961 --> 26:38.259
Ooh... Is that some celebrity?

26:38.330 --> 26:40.798
- No. Uh...
- [Justin] You kidding? She totally is!

26:40.865 --> 26:42.856
Claire Meade,
she murdered Fey Sommers.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.926
But she was completely justified.
It was a crime of passion,

26:46.004 --> 26:48.472
and I will not rest
until that woman is free!

26:48.540 --> 26:51.100
I'm starting a petition
at school tomorrow.

26:51.176 --> 26:52.768
What a pretty kitty. Can I pet her?

26:53.645 --> 26:56.478
He's starting a petition
to help out a murderer?

26:56.548 --> 26:58.641
They're going with insanity.

26:58.717 --> 27:01.914
Really, it helps Justin
focus his anxiety.

27:01.987 --> 27:05.286
<i>He's still pretty upset about
the Dreamgirls Best Picture snub.</i>

27:05.357 --> 27:06.949
<i>Babel? What's Babel?</i>

27:07.025 --> 27:09.960
<i>Oh, my God, I know.
Dreamgirls was a cinematic achievement.</i>

27:10.028 --> 27:13.657
And... how about the boobs
on that Beyonce, huh?

27:13.732 --> 27:16.064
[Hilda] I can't get the lid
off the trashcan!

27:16.134 --> 27:17.601
The cat's going for the door!

27:17.669 --> 27:20.137
- I got it!
- [Hilda] You can't go out!

27:20.205 --> 27:22.230
[Alarm wailing]

27:22.307 --> 27:24.070
- What is that noise?
- [Phone rings]

27:24.142 --> 27:25.632
Grandpa's under house arrest.

27:25.710 --> 27:27.940
- Yes, Constance.
- He murder someone, too?

27:28.013 --> 27:30.982
- No! He's not a criminal.
- He's an illegal immigrant.

27:31.049 --> 27:32.676
Would you shut up?

27:32.751 --> 27:35.379
Are you sure you want to
get involved with this family?

27:36.921 --> 27:38.980
What's he doing here?

27:40.892 --> 27:43.759
- Daniel?
- Who's Daniel?

27:43.828 --> 27:46.820
He's... Betty's ex-boyfriend.

27:48.700 --> 27:51.032
What? I can't play, too?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.577
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.609
Oh, Claire.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.810
How did you get in here?
Only family is permitted.

28:07.752 --> 28:09.481
I'm your incredibly tan sister.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.819
Let me look at you.

28:13.892 --> 28:18.488
Oh, you poor thing, and handcuffs?

28:19.764 --> 28:21.391
I have committed a crime.

28:21.466 --> 28:24.367
Not letting a woman have
her makeup bag. Now that's a crime.

28:26.304 --> 28:27.862
What do you want, Wilhelmina?

28:27.939 --> 28:30.635
I came out of great concern
for your children.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.872
Things are not going well
with Daniel and Alexis,

28:33.945 --> 28:37.904
and I fear they'll soon destroy
the magazine... and each other.

28:38.783 --> 28:39.943
Much better.

28:42.053 --> 28:45.887
So I thought if there was a way
to salvage what's left,

28:45.957 --> 28:50.360
if there were someone who could
supervise, perhaps mediate.

28:50.428 --> 28:52.396
And I suppose that person would be you?

28:52.464 --> 28:55.331
I practically ran the magazine
when Daniel was in charge.

28:55.400 --> 28:59.734
It's that I have no authority
in my current position.

28:59.804 --> 29:01.704
You want me to do
something about that?

29:01.773 --> 29:03.707
Well, I don't know what...

29:03.775 --> 29:08.212
...except maybe have your attorneys
draw up some contracts?

29:08.279 --> 29:10.611
I believe the phrase is...

29:10.682 --> 29:12.013
"Power of Attorney?"

29:13.351 --> 29:15.046
Yeah, something like that.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.680
It would be a way for me
to rightfully protect them.

29:17.756 --> 29:21.624
- After all, I am a mother too.
- You're telling me.

29:21.693 --> 29:23.160
Cut the act, Wilhelmina.

29:23.228 --> 29:26.163
I'm not Bradford or one of those
other suits in that office

29:26.231 --> 29:29.962
who can get taken in by your
collagen smile and your plastic ass.

29:31.002 --> 29:32.128
I see.

29:32.203 --> 29:36.936
Well, perhaps I can offer you something
that might change your mind.

29:40.478 --> 29:42.503
I know you're drying out and all,

29:42.580 --> 29:46.016
but one little sip
couldn't hurt, could it?

29:48.987 --> 29:54.118
I bet this would make those ice chips
taste so much better.

29:55.193 --> 29:58.720
You actually think I would sell out
my children for a lousy drink?

29:58.797 --> 30:03.632
Maybe not one, but after four or five.
You've been known to do a lot worse.

30:05.136 --> 30:08.401
Listen to me, Wilhelmina,
and you listen good.

30:08.473 --> 30:12.967
I know who you are, and you're not
getting your hands on this company.

30:13.044 --> 30:15.979
That slut Fey Sommers
may have become editor-in-chief

30:16.047 --> 30:18.572
by going after my husband.
But from now on,

30:18.650 --> 30:24.088
the only person running
this magazine will be a Meade.

30:27.058 --> 30:28.855
Sorry you feel that way, Claire.

30:28.927 --> 30:32.260
Perhaps I can... offer this to you

30:32.330 --> 30:36.323
with my humblest apologies.

30:39.904 --> 30:43.431
Oh, darn.
You can't reach that, can you?

30:44.309 --> 30:47.904
Oops. Look at the time, I gotta run.

30:48.713 --> 30:50.044
Sorry, dear.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.291
So did he pop the question yet?

31:11.369 --> 31:13.234
Stop! It's not funny.

31:13.304 --> 31:15.238
I have to kiss him
and he wears lip gloss.

31:16.007 --> 31:18.168
All right. So, I finished the letter.

31:18.243 --> 31:21.440
I wanted you to read it.
I think it turned out pretty well.

31:22.013 --> 31:25.471
"He Ain't Heavy,
She's My Brother." Aw...

31:25.950 --> 31:29.215
So if you can proof it, e-mail it
to Alexis, she can put it in the book.

31:29.287 --> 31:31.653
It has to be at the printers
by tomorrow morning.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.089
You could have just
e-mailed this to me.

31:34.158 --> 31:39.391
I wanted to see the look on your face
when you're not disappointed in me.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.057
Could you come here?

31:42.133 --> 31:45.432
My mother lost an earring and is
convinced your father stole it.

31:45.536 --> 31:46.867
Could you give us a minute?

31:49.507 --> 31:51.372
The honeymoon is definitely over.

31:52.176 --> 31:56.442
Well, as much fun as I make
of all your pep talks,

31:56.514 --> 32:00.041
they actually kinda made me
feel... peppy.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.119
What are you doing?

32:08.192 --> 32:10.854
I wanted to read this.
Daniel worked really hard on it.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.124
Forget that stupid letter
and come back in...

32:13.197 --> 32:15.131
- It's not stupid.
- No, but Daniel is.

32:15.199 --> 32:17.394
Alexis isn't putting that
in the magazine!

32:17.468 --> 32:18.492
She's not in charge!

32:18.569 --> 32:21.561
No one told her that.
She's redone the entire issue.

32:21.639 --> 32:24.733
It's already on its way to the printer.
Forget that and come here.

32:24.809 --> 32:28.267
Oh, my God.
I have to go and catch Daniel.

32:28.346 --> 32:30.211
No, Betty, Betty, you can't go!

32:30.281 --> 32:33.580
Betty, he is your ex-boyfriend

32:33.651 --> 32:35.482
and I am your current boyfriend.

32:35.553 --> 32:38.021
He is my boss, and you're an idiot!

I'm e-mailing the printer.
OK to type "Stop the presses?"

32:58.910 --> 33:02.471
I can't believe I trusted her.
I am so stupid.

33:02.547 --> 33:05.914
You were giving Alexis a chance,
wanted to believe the best in people.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.918
We're never gonna get there in time.

33:07.986 --> 33:11.854
You know, the printer's
not that far away. Come on.

33:15.793 --> 33:18.353
- Excuse us. Coming through.
- Excuse me!

33:22.867 --> 33:26.667
I just don't understand. Betty took off
with her ex-boyfriend?

33:26.738 --> 33:29.400
Marc, don't you think that's weird?

33:31.209 --> 33:35.543
Mom, there's something
I need to tell you about me.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.672
I am...

33:41.886 --> 33:43.547
...breaking up with Betty.

33:43.621 --> 33:46.988
Oh, thank God!

33:47.725 --> 33:49.818
Wait, you didn't like her?

33:49.894 --> 33:52.988
Marc, honey, let's be honest.
With that hair and that face,

33:53.064 --> 33:55.294
what were my grandchildren
gonna look like?

33:55.366 --> 33:57.994
Betty and her family
were pretty nice to us tonight.

33:58.069 --> 34:01.732
Don't get me started on the family.
Her father, why should I pay his taxes?

34:01.806 --> 34:03.501
- He broke into this country.
- Mom!

34:03.574 --> 34:06.702
And her sister, I don't want to use
the "S" word, but "slut."

- OK, shut your mouth, Mom!
- What did you say to me?

34:24.228 --> 34:26.958
You don't get to talk about
these people like that.

for me tonight.

buying? Can I have a banana daiquiri?

37:51.269 --> 37:55.797
- [Betty] She put herself on the cover!
- She always knows how to get at my Dad.

37:55.873 --> 37:59.775
You should read the Letter from
the Editor. It puts mine to shame.

37:59.844 --> 38:03.007
Actually, I don't need this anymore.

38:04.649 --> 38:07.049
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be!

38:07.118 --> 38:10.918
Betty, I'm finally free. I've wasted
all that time behind the desk.

38:10.988 --> 38:13.252
If Alex wants to take over,
then let him.

38:13.324 --> 38:15.315
I've got lots of partying
to catch up on.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.787
[Wilhelmina] Working late?

38:49.894 --> 38:51.555
A lot to catch up on.

38:51.629 --> 38:54.757
Bradford, I'm so sorry about Claire.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.892
I know how hard it must be
to come home to an empty house.

38:59.303 --> 39:01.134
How about a...

39:01.205 --> 39:04.868
...little dinner and some company?

39:12.483 --> 39:14.348
You're still here.

39:14.952 --> 39:19.514
I'm sorry I ran out earlier.
How did it go?

39:22.159 --> 39:25.595
Things got a little messy
after you left.

39:25.663 --> 39:28.655
I was outed to my mother.

39:29.433 --> 39:31.025
What?

39:31.102 --> 39:32.831
Who was it? My father?

39:32.903 --> 39:36.430
No, no, it wasn't him.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.299
It was me.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.839
- Wow.
- Yeah.

39:43.814 --> 39:45.805
She left.

39:49.754 --> 39:51.415
You know what, Marc?

39:52.990 --> 39:55.982
I learned something
about family tonight.

39:57.661 --> 40:00.789
They're not always the ones
who love you the most.

40:02.733 --> 40:06.225
Sometimes it's the family
that you make for yourself.

40:07.371 --> 40:09.362
OK, OK.

40:10.441 --> 40:14.639
Getting a little too Lifetime
Original Movie for me.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.069
But I get it.

40:18.983 --> 40:23.647
If she doesn't want to be a part
of my life, then... it's her loss.

40:25.556 --> 40:29.424
Because I'm freaking fabulous.

40:29.493 --> 40:31.723
Yes, you are.

40:31.796 --> 40:33.787
And just so you know,

40:33.864 --> 40:36.731
you'll always be
my little chimichanga.

40:39.904 --> 40:42.338
It doesn't mean I like you.

40:44.008 --> 40:46.067
<i>[Alexi Murdoch: Orange Sky]</i>

40:53.417 --> 40:55.783
<i>[Daniel] The great return of Alexis Mead</i>

40:55.853 --> 40:58.447
<i>is a story that's been played-out
enough in the media,</i>

40:58.522 --> 41:00.615
<i>so I won't go into all
the details here.</i>

41:00.691 --> 41:04.923
<i>But I will admit that I didn't
welcome my brother back at first.</i>

41:05.663 --> 41:08.655
<i>Partly because I wasn't used
to seeing him in a satin pump.</i>

41:08.732 --> 41:12.532
<i>Mostly, because when he went away,</i>

41:12.603 --> 41:15.663
<i>he broke my heart. So I was mad.</i>

41:16.574 --> 41:19.543
<i>But when I looked past my anger,
and his makeup,</i>

41:19.610 --> 41:23.068
<i>I realized I was happy
to have him back.</i>

41:24.682 --> 41:26.240
<i>I missed him so much.</i>

41:26.317 --> 41:29.718
<i>I should start saying "her."
I missed her so much.</i>

41:29.787 --> 41:33.086
<i>She's family, and it's family
that will keep this magazine going</i>

41:33.157 --> 41:35.318
<i>in the face of our personal crisis.</i>

41:36.260 --> 41:39.024
<i>It's family that gets you
through everything.</i>

41:41.799 --> 41:44.029
<i>So welcome back, Alexis.</i>

41:45.603 --> 41:48.868
<i>Thanks to you, I'm no longer alone.</i>

41:56.247 --> 41:58.238
