00:01.272 --> 00:03.732
<i>Previously on "Blindspot"...</i>

00:03.976 --> 00:05.488
Only three people
in the world know

00:05.523 --> 00:06.663
what I'm about
to tell you.

00:06.698 --> 00:08.108
It's called Daylight.

00:08.143 --> 00:09.867
Whoever did this to Jane
is coming for us.

00:09.902 --> 00:13.220
It's plain as day,
Guerrero needs to disappear.

00:14.510 --> 00:17.327
Those tattoos are not some
Sunday morning crossword puzzle.

00:17.362 --> 00:19.832
They contain
extremely sensitive

00:19.867 --> 00:21.624
classified intelligence.

00:21.659 --> 00:25.324
You put the case, yourself
and a civilian at great risk.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.031
I'm madly in love with you,
and unless I'm crazy,

00:28.066 --> 00:29.621
I'm pretty sure
you feel the same way.

00:29.656 --> 00:31.003
I'm working the biggest
case of my life.

00:31.038 --> 00:33.205
So, if you solve
the case, then...

00:33.256 --> 00:34.623
I'm sorry.

00:34.658 --> 00:36.805
Something happened
last night with Weller.

00:36.871 --> 00:39.646
Your relationship with
Agent Weller is complicated.

00:39.696 --> 00:41.579
Have you ever been married?

00:41.637 --> 00:43.627
No, too cheesy.

00:43.704 --> 00:45.910
Someone circled a bunch
of random letters.

00:45.945 --> 00:47.463
It's a secret code.

00:47.498 --> 00:51.473
Someone is using this
as a communication device.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:00.855 --> 01:03.170
Cause of death,
exsanguination

01:03.205 --> 01:05.937
from laceration
to the jugular vein.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.276
So, according to the report,

01:08.354 --> 01:11.578
she used a piece of glass
from a broken bottle.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.033
Moving away from David's
case file for just a moment...

01:14.068 --> 01:15.978
The fact that she used
a found object

01:16.013 --> 01:17.701
indicates that
it wasn't premeditated.

01:17.736 --> 01:20.604
Have you spoken to your
family since last night?

01:21.068 --> 01:23.787
Just my mom.
She wanted to fly out

01:23.822 --> 01:26.057
but I told her that
I was okay.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.954
Perhaps you should
reconsider?

01:27.989 --> 01:29.521
The killer had
to be trained.

01:29.556 --> 01:32.261
Normally, agents are asked
to take a leave of absence

01:32.296 --> 01:33.554
in situations like this.

01:33.589 --> 01:34.901
There is a mountain
of evidence

01:34.936 --> 01:36.289
that I need
to go through.

01:36.324 --> 01:39.099
Coming to terms with
a sudden loss is complicated,

01:39.134 --> 01:40.980
particularly the loss
of a loved one.

01:41.015 --> 01:43.066
We weren't
together anymore.

01:43.101 --> 01:44.298
Well, that may well
be the case, but...

01:44.333 --> 01:46.921
I can handle this.

01:48.437 --> 01:50.719
I'm going to recommend
you take some time.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.884
No, please... please
don't sign that paper.

01:56.878 --> 02:00.207
I can't go back to
my apartment.

02:00.460 --> 02:02.860
Everything there
reminds me of him.

02:02.895 --> 02:08.068
His... "Firefly" DVDs,
my board games.

02:09.735 --> 02:11.222
He didn't pick up
the last of his clothes

02:11.257 --> 02:13.165
I think because
he thought...

02:13.200 --> 02:14.525
Agent Patterson,
I can't just...

02:14.560 --> 02:17.195
Please, just...

02:18.593 --> 02:22.256
give me one day so I can
be here with my team,

02:22.291 --> 02:24.625
because I know
that I can help.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.114
One day, and then
we'll take it from there.

02:30.149 --> 02:33.259
Okay.
Thank you.

03:30.743 --> 03:32.696
You are out of control.

03:32.756 --> 03:34.318
Well, good morning
to you, too.

03:34.353 --> 03:36.522
How could you
be so reckless?

03:36.557 --> 03:37.813
Guerrero's back
in the papers

03:37.848 --> 03:39.550
because of your
sloppy clean-up job.

03:39.585 --> 03:42.607
Oh, there was nothing
sloppy about it.

03:42.642 --> 03:44.842
And they'll never be able
to trace it back to us.

03:44.877 --> 03:47.143
I was in the building
when you killed him.

03:47.209 --> 03:50.634
That was simply
bad timing.

03:51.743 --> 03:53.447
He would've
signed those papers.

03:53.482 --> 03:55.268
Yeah, well, now,
he doesn't need to.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.938
Jane Doe ties us
to Daylight.

03:57.973 --> 04:01.423
I've done my job.
Now, you do yours.

04:21.526 --> 04:23.581
_

04:23.616 --> 04:24.293
What is that?

04:24.328 --> 04:26.777
This is a very sensitive

04:26.812 --> 04:28.496
surveillance device,

04:28.531 --> 04:31.558
and I want it inside
Jane's safe house.

04:51.035 --> 04:53.261
What are you doing
down here?

04:53.986 --> 04:56.220
Uh...

04:57.318 --> 05:00.037
I don't know.

05:00.932 --> 05:04.274
I thought maybe seeing it
would trigger something.

05:07.361 --> 05:08.357
This tattoo...

05:08.392 --> 05:09.765
Jane.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.059
You can't
blame yourself.

05:11.094 --> 05:13.901
The only reason David
was in that library

05:13.936 --> 05:15.732
was because he was
following this.

05:15.767 --> 05:17.494
And I'm covered in these,

05:17.529 --> 05:19.629
but I have no control
over what they mean

05:19.664 --> 05:21.717
or what happens
because of them.

05:21.752 --> 05:24.729
Jane, these tattoos,

05:24.764 --> 05:26.378
they've saved
a lot of lives.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.932
Not this time.

05:28.742 --> 05:32.203
This wasn't some terrorist
or criminal that died.

05:32.561 --> 05:35.097
It was Patterson's boyfriend.

05:35.784 --> 05:38.330
How is she gonna
move on from this?

05:39.294 --> 05:43.006
I've never lost
anyone before.

05:44.369 --> 05:47.014
At least, not anyone
I can remember.

05:47.269 --> 05:50.772
You're lucky.
It takes time.

05:52.618 --> 05:55.118
Come on,
let's get to work.

05:55.428 --> 05:57.248
So, according to the report,
David's killer

05:57.283 --> 05:59.209
left some type of encoded
message in a reference book.

05:59.244 --> 06:01.956
Yeah, and then she went
to a second book and placed

06:01.991 --> 06:04.273
this piece of paper
inside the book's spine.

06:04.308 --> 06:05.009
How do we know this?

06:05.044 --> 06:07.746
I put an agent in place
to surveil the book.

06:07.781 --> 06:12.291
Agent Brott was monitoring it
for any suspicious activity.

06:14.078 --> 06:15.749
He's the one who
found David's body

06:15.784 --> 06:17.136
in the alley and alerted me.

06:17.171 --> 06:19.140
We got an initial
report from IAFIS.

06:19.175 --> 06:20.955
There was a partial
print left in the book.

06:20.990 --> 06:22.691
We have a print?

06:27.014 --> 06:30.476
Hey, are you sure
that you wanna be here?

06:30.601 --> 06:32.867
Patterson, it's okay,
we got this.

06:32.902 --> 06:36.000
I'm... I'm not sitting
this one out.

06:36.184 --> 06:37.927
Do we have a print?

06:41.351 --> 06:43.048
The partial wasn't
from David's killer,

06:43.083 --> 06:45.328
it was from this man
named Roger Levkin.

06:45.363 --> 06:46.859
Successful architect,

06:46.894 --> 06:50.092
lives in Westchester County,
clean criminal record.

06:50.127 --> 06:52.539
Married ten years
to his wife Emily,

06:52.574 --> 06:54.257
an econ professor at NYU.

06:54.292 --> 06:56.081
That doesn't sound
very suspicious to me.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.055
Except he was
born in Russia.

06:58.090 --> 07:00.303
Became a U.S. citizen
through marriage.

07:00.394 --> 07:02.466
Do you think his Russian
background plays into this?

07:02.501 --> 07:05.612
The books in the library,
the codes, hidden messages.

07:05.647 --> 07:07.469
Feels like Russian
tradecraft.

07:07.504 --> 07:08.967
Old school
Cold War tactics.

07:09.002 --> 07:11.152
Are you saying
we're dealing with spies?

07:11.249 --> 07:13.100
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

07:13.181 --> 07:14.656
Let's move.

07:15.838 --> 07:17.968
I'll put the library books
through processing...

07:18.106 --> 07:20.033
see if I can
find any codes anywhere.

07:20.068 --> 07:21.543
Okay.

07:35.133 --> 07:38.006
- Are you okay?
- Yeah... yeah.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.680
Here, take a look
at this.

07:39.715 --> 07:42.076
Uh, the killer hid that
inside the second book.

07:42.111 --> 07:43.611
Some kind of
decoding device?

07:43.646 --> 07:47.672
So 47 was circled
in the first book.

07:47.805 --> 07:50.578
So there must be a reason
why they used two books.

07:50.644 --> 07:53.223
I mean, maybe it's
referring to a...

07:53.293 --> 07:55.919
a page in the second book?

07:56.266 --> 07:59.838
So... page 47.

08:01.077 --> 08:02.416
Here we go.

08:02.528 --> 08:05.585
And the decoding device.

08:06.122 --> 08:08.751
Of course.

08:08.951 --> 08:11.119
It's a windowbox overlay.

08:13.199 --> 08:15.576
"Status nominal will
continue to monitor.

08:15.611 --> 08:17.425
No further updates."

08:17.544 --> 08:19.346
She was reporting in.

08:19.451 --> 08:22.687
It's useless to us now.

08:36.918 --> 08:38.352
Something's not right.

08:40.775 --> 08:42.856
You two, go around
the house that side.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.495
Meet you around the back.
Tasha, cover the front.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.341
Got eyes on the suspect's wife.

09:08.376 --> 09:09.984
She's being held hostage
in the kitchen.

09:10.019 --> 09:10.986
Suspect is armed.

09:11.029 --> 09:12.333
Going in.

09:21.774 --> 09:23.324
I'm so sorry.

09:23.425 --> 09:24.334
Shut up.

09:24.572 --> 09:26.198
Give me your hand.

09:29.379 --> 09:31.408
Give me your other hand!
Turn over.

09:31.443 --> 09:32.427
Turn over!

09:36.154 --> 09:38.049
Open your mouth.

09:38.229 --> 09:40.007
Open your mouth!

09:40.042 --> 09:41.543
Open it!

09:47.180 --> 09:48.553
He's dead.

09:56.397 --> 10:01.397
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

10:08.584 --> 10:11.753
Uh, you wanted to see me?

10:12.190 --> 10:14.403
How are you doing?

10:14.533 --> 10:15.767
Fine.

10:16.233 --> 10:17.874
You're not fine.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.836
Please, don't send me home.

10:20.871 --> 10:25.900
Look... I know what
it's like to lose someone.

10:26.032 --> 10:29.020
And I know what it's like
to need answers.

10:29.113 --> 10:32.615
But if at any point this
gets too difficult for you,

10:32.762 --> 10:35.301
you have to be
honest with me.

10:47.683 --> 10:49.930
They're gonna run a tox screen,
but it looks like Roger died

10:49.965 --> 10:52.425
from a fast-acting poison,
probably cyanide.

10:52.460 --> 10:53.399
Something doesn't add up.

10:53.434 --> 10:54.987
If Roger really
was a Russian spy

10:55.022 --> 10:57.568
and his American wife
was his cover,

10:57.942 --> 10:58.961
why would he try
to kill her?

10:58.996 --> 11:01.368
They had the perfect setup...
nice home, good jobs.

11:01.403 --> 11:03.416
I don't know, ten years is
a long time to live a lie.

11:03.451 --> 11:04.866
Maybe he just snapped.

11:04.901 --> 11:06.975
There's gotta be a connection
to those library books.

11:07.010 --> 11:08.417
It's too big of
a coincidence that two people

11:08.452 --> 11:11.265
who had contact with him
end up dead within 24 hours.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.721
You think David
finding those books

11:12.810 --> 11:14.537
has something to do
with all of this?

11:14.594 --> 11:16.963
Roger's wife has no idea what
made him turn this morning.

11:16.998 --> 11:18.326
He mentioned something
about never meaning

11:18.368 --> 11:19.922
to fall in love with her.

11:19.957 --> 11:21.112
Did he say anything else?

11:21.170 --> 11:22.777
She said that he was
talking about targets

11:22.818 --> 11:23.698
and an operation.

11:23.765 --> 11:24.677
That's not good.

11:24.712 --> 11:26.251
Check this out.
The same lady

11:26.286 --> 11:28.183
from the library
surveillance photo.

11:28.251 --> 11:31.887
Same build, same age,
and look at the hair.

11:32.195 --> 11:34.730
Do you think she could
be David's killer?

11:36.505 --> 11:38.706
This is Kate Williams.

11:39.308 --> 11:42.492
She's a friend.
Why?

11:42.634 --> 11:46.167
Kate Williams is a fifth grade
teacher in the Bronx.

11:46.225 --> 11:49.010
She lives on 77th
between Park and Madison.

11:49.105 --> 11:51.155
Fancy address on
a teacher's salary?

11:51.190 --> 11:53.577
Her husband is a commercial
real estate broker,

11:53.612 --> 11:54.907
Nathan Williams.

11:54.993 --> 11:57.224
Married ten years,
no kids.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.262
Does Kate have any
connections to Russia?

11:59.352 --> 12:01.562
Yeah, a big one.
She was born there.

12:01.597 --> 12:02.752
She matches the description

12:02.787 --> 12:04.979
and the profile
of David's killer.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.508
It has to be her.

12:06.795 --> 12:10.158
Nathan filed a missing persons
report with the NYPD

12:10.193 --> 12:11.958
when Kate didn't
come home.

12:12.074 --> 12:13.683
He's at the 82nd precinct
in Brooklyn

12:13.718 --> 12:15.180
right now being questioned.

12:15.239 --> 12:16.404
Tell 'em to
hold him there.

12:16.439 --> 12:17.721
We need to talk to him.

12:17.782 --> 12:22.553
This is Agent Kara Sloane with
the counter espionage division.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.250
She's going to be
assisting us.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.501
Assistant Director Mayfair
got me up to speed.

12:26.536 --> 12:27.971
These new developments
are lining up

12:28.006 --> 12:29.208
with chatter that
we've been hearing

12:29.243 --> 12:30.688
about a possible
sleeper cell.

12:30.748 --> 12:32.736
Kate Williams
certainly fits the MO.

12:32.771 --> 12:36.035
Russian born, married to
a successful American citizen,

12:36.123 --> 12:37.762
fully assimilated
into the community,

12:37.843 --> 12:40.111
up until now, leading
a seemingly normal life.

12:40.146 --> 12:44.130
With David's murder
and Roger Levkin's suicide,

12:44.218 --> 12:46.127
it all points to some
sort of mission.

12:46.195 --> 12:47.436
My source at
the Russian Embassy

12:47.471 --> 12:50.067
says that things started to
heat up about 12 hours ago.

12:50.159 --> 12:51.296
Around the same time
David got killed.

12:51.331 --> 12:52.412
Well, maybe the Russians
thought David

12:52.447 --> 12:53.967
was a Fed and was onto them.

12:54.002 --> 12:56.246
Which could have
activated their mission.

12:56.352 --> 12:58.225
Roger did mention
something about targets.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.901
All of our intel points
to assassination plots,

13:00.936 --> 13:02.766
but who or why
are big unknowns.

13:02.801 --> 13:05.347
Roger Levkin's mark
was his wife.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.883
Could the spies be
targeting their spouses?

13:08.927 --> 13:11.351
Possibly, or she could
have been the anomaly.

13:11.431 --> 13:12.966
We simply don't have
enough information.

13:13.017 --> 13:14.496
Jane and I'll
head to Brooklyn.

13:14.531 --> 13:16.209
We'll interview
Kate's husband.

13:16.244 --> 13:18.287
You two, head to
the Upper East Side,

13:18.322 --> 13:21.197
get that address and see what
you can find at that house.

13:24.577 --> 13:26.971
When she didn't come home from work
yesterday, I called the police.

13:27.006 --> 13:29.148
- Has she gone missing before?
- No, never.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.440
I've called all her friends,
no one's heard from her.

13:31.475 --> 13:33.274
Your wife was
born in Russia.

13:33.309 --> 13:35.719
Has she stayed in contact
with her family back there?

13:35.820 --> 13:37.769
Kate lost her parents
when she was a child.

13:37.804 --> 13:39.411
What about any Russian
friends in New York?

13:39.446 --> 13:40.344
Ties to the community?

13:40.379 --> 13:41.916
I guess, Roger Levkin,

13:41.984 --> 13:43.495
but Kate's friends
with his wife.

13:43.530 --> 13:44.890
What does this have
to do with anything?

13:44.963 --> 13:47.349
We're investigating every
angle right now, sir.

13:47.384 --> 13:49.504
Let us know if you do
hear from her, and...

13:49.539 --> 13:51.912
we'll do the same
if we hear anything.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.879
Patterson?

13:55.914 --> 13:57.426
Actually, it's me
and Agent Sloane.

13:57.461 --> 13:58.803
<i>What have you got?</i>

13:58.979 --> 14:00.135
We've been drilling
down into the lives

14:00.170 --> 14:02.441
of our suspected spies
and their spouses.

14:02.476 --> 14:06.748
Our vector search cross-checked
DMV records, social media pages,

14:06.783 --> 14:08.082
credit card receipts,
you name it.

14:08.116 --> 14:10.211
Turns out there's one
common denominator.

14:10.246 --> 14:11.583
Olivia Delidio.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.881
I'm sending you
her photo now.

14:14.050 --> 14:16.630
So what do you got on her?

14:16.665 --> 14:19.358
Russian born, married to
an American for 12 years.

14:19.393 --> 14:22.419
And not just any American.
Edward Delidio.

14:22.454 --> 14:24.396
An editor of
"The New York Times."

14:24.431 --> 14:26.619
<i>They have two young children
and they live in Gramercy Park.</i>

14:26.654 --> 14:29.563
Patterson, send a team to the
husband... he could be a target.

14:29.629 --> 14:30.786
Yeah, on it.

14:30.856 --> 14:32.027
Olivia seems
to fit the mold,

14:32.085 --> 14:34.151
<i>marrying a successful
and connected spouse.</i>

14:34.186 --> 14:35.714
<i>Got an address for Olivia?</i>

14:35.857 --> 14:37.338
She works at
Queens Museum.

14:39.427 --> 14:41.786
How could the Russians
be so sure their agents

14:41.821 --> 14:43.790
could get these people
to marry them?

14:43.825 --> 14:46.142
I'm sure they profiled
their targets for years,

14:46.177 --> 14:49.636
creating matches based on
personalities, interests.

14:49.671 --> 14:52.113
- That's a lot of effort.
- It's worth it for them.

14:52.148 --> 14:54.927
Being able to assimilate
so they prevent getting caught.

14:54.962 --> 14:58.959
But still, to just give up
your whole life like that.

15:00.656 --> 15:03.179
I wonder if they ever
regretted it.

15:10.694 --> 15:11.724
Hi, ma'am.

15:11.759 --> 15:14.375
We're the FBI, we're looking
for Olivia Delidio.

15:14.462 --> 15:16.217
She's in the Panorama.

15:16.252 --> 15:17.752
Thank you.

15:25.195 --> 15:27.842
Sir?
My name is Kurt Weller.

15:27.916 --> 15:29.403
I'm with the FBI.

15:30.135 --> 15:32.737
I'm looking for
Olivia Delidio.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.350
That's her...
over there.

15:34.385 --> 15:36.707
That's her? Thank you.

15:42.273 --> 15:44.207
She's running!

16:07.990 --> 16:09.491
Hey!

16:09.730 --> 16:12.332
I'm with the FBI,
I need to borrow your bike.

16:38.518 --> 16:40.052
Get out of the car!

16:42.602 --> 16:43.969
Out.

16:51.471 --> 16:53.232
_

16:53.367 --> 16:55.035
_

16:55.408 --> 16:57.381
_

16:58.018 --> 16:59.251
_

17:01.448 --> 17:03.008
Why did you run?

17:03.075 --> 17:05.480
Where is Kate Williams?

17:05.638 --> 17:07.079
She doesn't even
seem nervous.

17:07.115 --> 17:09.425
She's had years
of Soviet training.

17:09.493 --> 17:11.297
Has she been checked
for a cyanide cap?

17:11.332 --> 17:13.018
Yeah, we checked her,
she's clean.

17:13.085 --> 17:14.723
<i>This is the last time
that I'm gonna ask you.</i>

17:14.796 --> 17:15.938
<i>Where is Kate Williams?</i>

17:15.973 --> 17:17.625
I told you,
I don't know.

17:17.660 --> 17:18.807
We were at your apartment.

17:18.842 --> 17:21.343
Your doorman confirmed Kate
slept there last night.

17:21.377 --> 17:23.756
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

17:23.790 --> 17:27.070
<i>Yes, Kate and I
are both Russian.</i>

17:27.106 --> 17:28.724
<i>We both married Americans.</i>

17:28.759 --> 17:32.670
<i>We're good friends,
we talk all the time.</i>

17:32.748 --> 17:34.038
"We talk all the time."

17:34.073 --> 17:36.341
<i>How does that
make us spies?</i>

17:36.469 --> 17:37.831
That's it.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.984
What's it?

17:40.073 --> 17:42.775
Patterson, what's it?

17:47.944 --> 17:49.787
This is a witch hunt!

17:49.848 --> 17:51.535
Where's my lawyer
and my husband?

17:51.578 --> 17:53.239
We spoke to your husband,
he's bringing your lawyer.

17:53.274 --> 17:54.967
In the meantime, you can
help yourself out

17:55.040 --> 17:57.175
by telling us the truth.

18:00.182 --> 18:01.146
Sorry to interrupt.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.144
It's okay.
You wanna talk outside?

18:02.179 --> 18:04.574
I have something,
I just need a minute.

18:09.086 --> 18:11.121
Do you recognize this?

18:11.277 --> 18:12.432
It's a book.

18:12.467 --> 18:15.655
This was used as
a communication device

18:15.760 --> 18:17.920
by you and your friend Kate.

18:18.022 --> 18:19.684
We have video
surveillance of her

18:19.719 --> 18:21.986
at the Brooklyn Historical
Society last night.

18:22.021 --> 18:23.913
I've never been there.

18:23.976 --> 18:26.961
<i>This is a reference book
with a due date card,</i>

18:27.044 --> 18:29.683
<i>which doesn't really make any
sense because reference books</i>

18:29.756 --> 18:31.464
can't be checked out.

18:31.807 --> 18:34.422
So, these dates...
these aren't really dates.

18:34.522 --> 18:35.658
Are they?

18:35.693 --> 18:41.071
523, 207, 430.

18:42.208 --> 18:45.764
Three code names
for three spies.

18:45.986 --> 18:49.347
Roger, Kate, and you.

18:49.382 --> 18:51.609
That is a wild guess.

18:51.691 --> 18:54.618
Or not a guess at all.

18:54.802 --> 18:58.086
I ran a handwriting analysis
and it's a perfect match.

18:58.223 --> 18:59.625
She's bluffing.

18:59.714 --> 19:01.926
She couldn't have had
time to run that test.

19:02.004 --> 19:06.669
That... and we found
a partial print,

19:06.722 --> 19:09.154
which confirms that
you're part of the ring.

19:09.240 --> 19:10.402
There's no way
you have a print.

19:10.437 --> 19:13.476
I-I've never seen
that book before.

19:18.327 --> 19:20.094
I didn't think we had
a print for Olivia.

19:20.148 --> 19:23.333
We don't.
That's Roger's.

19:25.278 --> 19:26.837
You got complacent.

19:26.872 --> 19:29.572
Ten years.

19:29.855 --> 19:32.924
I don't know, maybe you just
forgot to wipe the book down.

19:33.562 --> 19:35.663
You're out of moves.

19:38.318 --> 19:40.220
The longer you let
this drag out,

19:40.255 --> 19:42.496
the longer it's gonna be
before you see your children.

19:42.531 --> 19:44.121
My children have done
nothing wrong.

19:44.156 --> 19:46.536
You're right, they're
innocent, but you're not.

19:46.571 --> 19:47.938
You'll be charged
with espionage,

19:47.973 --> 19:50.918
treason, accessory to murder,
thrown in prison for the rest

19:50.953 --> 19:52.955
of your life,
if you're lucky.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.828
Olivia...

19:59.036 --> 20:01.379
it's up to you
how this plays out.

20:01.419 --> 20:05.021
If you wanna see your children
grow up, start talking.

20:09.419 --> 20:13.731
I was recruited
as a teenager.

20:14.015 --> 20:16.880
They said I would be part of
a long-term mission in America.

20:16.969 --> 20:18.669
And what was your mission?

20:18.704 --> 20:20.171
To marry an American target

20:20.239 --> 20:21.625
who had access
to the kind of information

20:21.660 --> 20:23.112
that could be interesting
to Russia.

20:23.201 --> 20:25.244
What kind of information?

20:27.105 --> 20:29.180
Confidential reports
on people profiled

20:29.215 --> 20:31.441
in "The New York Times."

20:31.574 --> 20:34.155
I used my husband's passwords
to get into his account.

20:34.190 --> 20:36.471
And you used the reference book
to communicate the intel back?

20:36.506 --> 20:38.265
<i>You have to understand,
I was an orphan,</i>

20:38.300 --> 20:39.198
<i>I was starving.</i>

20:39.233 --> 20:42.874
<i>I had nowhere to sleep,
I-I had nothing.</i>

20:42.968 --> 20:45.302
<i>No one.</i>

20:45.492 --> 20:47.406
<i>That's why I agreed
to do this.</i>

20:47.480 --> 20:50.168
Have a chance
at a normal life.

20:50.285 --> 20:52.862
I never expected to fall
in love with Edward.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.920
And then we had children.

20:56.507 --> 20:59.510
And it all seemed like
it was meant to be.

20:59.650 --> 21:03.414
Sending the intel back
was a small price to pay.

21:04.670 --> 21:06.134
We never hurt anyone.

21:06.169 --> 21:07.903
Until now.

21:08.515 --> 21:14.191
An innocent man is dead
because of your actions!

21:14.384 --> 21:17.203
Do you think that
that is a small price to pay?

21:17.238 --> 21:19.206
Patterson, come here.

21:22.853 --> 21:26.512
Hey... you have every
reason to be angry.

21:26.611 --> 21:28.645
David was someone that
you really cared about,

21:28.680 --> 21:32.072
so that matters
to all of us.

21:32.140 --> 21:34.650
We will get Kate.

21:34.808 --> 21:36.731
I promise you.

21:38.688 --> 21:40.585
You need to tell us
everything now.

21:40.646 --> 21:44.449
What happened after
the library book was exposed?

21:44.598 --> 21:46.828
I've already said
too much.

21:51.007 --> 21:52.012
"God help me."

21:52.047 --> 21:54.180
Of course,
you speak Russian.

21:54.389 --> 21:55.667
Let me try.

21:55.708 --> 21:57.409
I can get her
to open up.

21:59.152 --> 22:00.419
Yeah.

22:03.954 --> 22:05.237
_

22:06.263 --> 22:11.722
_

22:11.965 --> 22:14.904
_

22:15.272 --> 22:18.326
_

22:20.500 --> 22:23.070
I know you love
your children,

22:23.105 --> 22:24.294
and they mean
more than any promise

22:24.329 --> 22:26.664
you could have made
to Russia.

22:26.887 --> 22:30.055
My... children
are my world.

22:30.090 --> 22:32.258
Then do the right thing.

22:32.578 --> 22:34.441
Tell us everything.

22:34.623 --> 22:36.958
What are your orders?

22:37.657 --> 22:39.958
Our handler initiated
the extraction plan last night.

22:40.008 --> 22:42.361
We were given t...
targets.

22:42.475 --> 22:43.688
People to kill.

22:43.723 --> 22:45.357
Timeline?

22:47.519 --> 22:48.650
24 hours.

22:48.685 --> 22:49.958
Who's your target?

22:50.024 --> 22:51.722
Boris Ivanovich,

22:51.757 --> 22:53.454
a journalist
at the "Times."

22:53.489 --> 22:55.226
What happens to Boris
once your handlers

22:55.261 --> 22:56.702
find out
you were captured?

22:56.737 --> 22:59.634
Another operative
completes the mission.

23:01.359 --> 23:02.239
<i>I'm sending you a photo</i>

23:02.297 --> 23:04.825
<i>of the target,
Boris Ivanovich.</i>

23:04.942 --> 23:06.754
He defected to the States
two years ago.

23:06.789 --> 23:08.808
Prior to that, he was
an anti-Putin blogger

23:08.843 --> 23:10.345
with a huge following.

23:10.396 --> 23:12.530
<i>I mean, millions of Russians
get their news from his site.</i>

23:12.565 --> 23:13.582
Did you alert Boris?

23:13.617 --> 23:14.871
His phone goes
straight to voicemail.

23:14.906 --> 23:17.249
But I was able to hack
into his email account,

23:17.472 --> 23:18.809
and it looks like
he's supposed to meet up

23:18.844 --> 23:21.535
with a source for a tip
in Coolidge Park.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.442
Park bench by the bridge.

23:28.853 --> 23:30.587
Boris.

23:33.589 --> 23:35.200
He's dead.

23:45.503 --> 23:47.680
Olivia confirmed there
were three operatives.

23:47.715 --> 23:49.003
Each had a separate target.

23:49.038 --> 23:50.735
So that leaves
one sitting duck.

23:50.770 --> 23:52.800
My teams have been
profiling Emily and Boris,

23:52.835 --> 23:54.011
hoping it'll give
us some clues

23:54.046 --> 23:55.563
to the final
target's identity.

23:55.598 --> 23:57.303
In addition to being
a professor,

23:57.338 --> 24:00.388
Emily Levkin testified at
several congressional hearings.

24:00.423 --> 24:02.375
She was in favor for
sanctioning Russia

24:02.410 --> 24:04.120
for human rights violations

24:04.155 --> 24:06.364
and its annexation
of Crimea.

24:06.455 --> 24:10.297
Boris Ivanovich was known
for his blog and op-ed pieces

24:10.332 --> 24:12.000
exposing Putin's corruption.

24:12.035 --> 24:14.107
So both were vocal critics
of Russia's policies.

24:14.142 --> 24:16.079
That could be bad news
for the ruling class.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.901
Putin's been cracking down on
people he deems unpatriotic.

24:18.936 --> 24:20.690
So, it makes sense that
he'd use these sleeper agents

24:20.725 --> 24:22.410
to take down dissenters
in the United States.

24:22.445 --> 24:24.836
That still doesn't
narrow it down much.

24:25.237 --> 24:28.020
Our best bet is to find
Kate Williams.

24:47.324 --> 24:48.627
Any leads on Kate?

24:48.661 --> 24:51.884
Not exactly, but I discovered
both Olivia and Roger

24:51.919 --> 24:53.554
started checking
the same website

24:53.589 --> 24:56.257
last night after David...

24:56.705 --> 24:59.861
...after the book
was compromised.

24:59.954 --> 25:00.883
Brighton Beach Tourism Board.

25:00.918 --> 25:02.684
Brighton Beach?
That's Little Odessa.

25:02.719 --> 25:05.003
There's a huge Russian
community there.

25:05.038 --> 25:07.531
I couldn't figure out
the connection beyond that

25:07.573 --> 25:10.090
until I got Roger's
tox screen back.

25:10.125 --> 25:12.053
I thought he died from
cyanide poisoning.

25:12.088 --> 25:13.670
The actual C.O.D.
was from a poison

25:13.705 --> 25:15.597
called aconite...
deadly flowering plant.

25:15.632 --> 25:17.697
So what has that got
to do with this website?

25:17.732 --> 25:20.153
Check out the live webcam.

25:20.270 --> 25:23.470
360-degree view of all
the restaurants and shops,

25:23.505 --> 25:24.866
including a flower shop.

25:24.905 --> 25:26.302
You think that's where
the aconite came from?

25:26.337 --> 25:29.305
Pretty sure there's
a connection to our spies.

25:29.593 --> 25:31.718
Check out the window display.

25:31.788 --> 25:33.854
Odd prices for
those garlands.

25:33.889 --> 25:35.486
Not just odd...
familiar.

25:35.521 --> 25:40.154
From the reference book,
523, 430, 207.

25:40.189 --> 25:41.290
Coded message.

25:41.363 --> 25:42.418
I'm trying to crack it
as we speak.

25:42.453 --> 25:44.407
Let's see if our friend
in holding can help us.

25:44.442 --> 25:48.005
I'll get Mayfair to send
a team out to the flower shop.

25:48.149 --> 25:49.817
We're gonna find her.

25:50.123 --> 25:52.367
The display
at the flower shop

25:52.402 --> 25:53.922
was our way
of communicating

25:53.957 --> 25:56.570
in case the library
system was compromised.

25:56.615 --> 25:58.955
You didn't think that was
something we should know?

26:00.143 --> 26:02.379
You're not making things
easier on yourself.

26:02.416 --> 26:03.814
What do the flowers mean?

26:03.849 --> 26:07.435
They were our
targets' names.

26:07.676 --> 26:09.103
So, who's
Kate's target?

26:09.138 --> 26:11.458
I only had a key
to decode my own.

26:11.493 --> 26:12.748
It was a security measure

26:12.783 --> 26:14.961
in case any of us
got compromised.

26:14.996 --> 26:17.022
Well, then,
give me your key.

26:17.096 --> 26:18.540
The Russians
are moving fast.

26:18.575 --> 26:20.228
They torched
the flower shop.

26:20.263 --> 26:22.744
By the time the agents I sent
out there arrived on the scene,

26:22.810 --> 26:24.349
it was a four-alarm fire.

26:24.426 --> 26:26.331
They tried to corrupt the data
on the shop's computer,

26:26.366 --> 26:27.276
but I was able to recover

26:27.311 --> 26:29.218
a partial file
from their server.

26:29.253 --> 26:32.221
There's a defense contractor
expo at the Intrepid today.

26:32.256 --> 26:35.215
Looks like they forged an
entrance badge with her photo.

26:35.288 --> 26:36.330
So that's where
the target must be.

26:36.398 --> 26:37.437
That could be anyone.

26:37.487 --> 26:40.434
Those kinds of expos attract
a lot of high-ranking people.

26:40.469 --> 26:42.303
I'll have my team go
through the attendance list.

26:42.371 --> 26:43.409
I'll keep working on
the flower codes.

26:43.444 --> 26:45.306
All right, let's move.

26:48.143 --> 26:50.079
Patterson,
what do you got?

26:50.114 --> 26:53.228
I figured out the target.
So, based on Olivia's key,

26:53.263 --> 26:55.047
I reverse engineered
the flower cipher

26:55.089 --> 26:57.625
and it's a modified
binary code.

26:57.660 --> 26:59.200
I ran every
possible combination

26:59.235 --> 27:00.446
through my breakdown
software,

27:00.506 --> 27:02.356
and I got a name
for Kate's target.

27:02.400 --> 27:05.077
It's Senator Steve Riewolt
from Connecticut.

27:05.144 --> 27:08.594
<i>He's a member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.</i>

27:08.673 --> 27:09.416
Why him?

27:09.451 --> 27:12.249
<i>He's behind the bill sending
aid to the Ukrainian military.</i>

27:12.284 --> 27:13.628
Does he have
a security detail?

27:13.675 --> 27:15.240
He's there alone, I just
talked to his office

27:15.275 --> 27:16.797
in Washington,
tried his cell,

27:16.832 --> 27:18.208
he's not picking up.

27:18.338 --> 27:19.229
Keep trying.

27:19.264 --> 27:21.257
We gotta canvas this ship
as fast as possible.

27:21.292 --> 27:23.105
Everyone take
a different entrance.

28:01.476 --> 28:04.225
I think I see Kate... she's
in the World War II exhibit.

28:11.770 --> 28:14.729
Kate Williams?
FBI, put your hands up.

28:16.430 --> 28:18.786
Now!

28:18.871 --> 28:21.318
Reade, secure the husband.
I got her, I got her!

28:42.260 --> 28:43.527
Uhh!

28:54.691 --> 28:55.959
Weller, where are you?

28:56.042 --> 28:57.469
<i>Kate's headed up
to the bridge.</i>

28:57.504 --> 28:59.004
<i>I'm in pursuit.</i>

28:59.575 --> 29:01.403
I'm headed your way.

29:17.363 --> 29:18.696
I got Kate!

29:18.731 --> 29:20.373
She's on the flight deck
heading towards the stairs

29:20.408 --> 29:22.279
near the planes!

29:38.377 --> 29:40.677
Which way?
Stern or bow!

29:40.730 --> 29:41.729
Bow!

31:18.101 --> 31:19.368
Patterson.

31:22.298 --> 31:26.681
Patterson, come on.
Come on.

31:42.455 --> 31:43.922
Hey.

31:44.323 --> 31:46.892
I... I wanted
to thank you.

31:47.818 --> 31:50.186
If... If we didn't
get her...

31:52.476 --> 31:53.876
I...

31:54.131 --> 31:56.827
Thank you.

31:57.371 --> 32:00.339
I wish that there was
more that I could do.

32:01.808 --> 32:06.999
I thought that if...
if I... solved this,

32:07.034 --> 32:10.048
and if I found
his killer,

32:10.083 --> 32:14.109
I would feel...
uh...

32:17.100 --> 32:18.701
I...

32:20.526 --> 32:23.561
But I feel the same.

32:23.864 --> 32:28.271
Just... empty.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.752
Like solving this
didn't change anything.

32:35.119 --> 32:38.492
Is that what
it's like for you?

32:38.731 --> 32:41.169
With the tattoos?

32:45.242 --> 32:47.420
That's awful.

32:48.831 --> 32:52.805
I just wish I could relive
the last few weeks.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.088
Hey.

32:56.221 --> 32:58.130
You can't think
like that.

32:58.292 --> 32:59.979
I mean, David was right.

33:00.014 --> 33:03.867
We were... we were
great together.

33:05.281 --> 33:07.379
And I was just scared.

33:07.472 --> 33:10.439
You had no idea any
of this was gonna happen.

33:10.474 --> 33:16.293
I wasted so much energy
on why it wouldn't work,

33:16.450 --> 33:19.285
when I could've been...

33:20.687 --> 33:22.856
I loved him.

33:24.191 --> 33:27.392
And... and I... he was
right in front of me,

33:27.427 --> 33:28.942
and I should've just
held onto him.

33:28.985 --> 33:31.821
Instead, I just
pushed him away.

33:34.517 --> 33:37.290
And now, he's gone.

33:38.956 --> 33:40.456
Here.

33:44.719 --> 33:46.567
I don't know how I could've
gotten through today

33:46.602 --> 33:48.791
without all of you.

33:58.549 --> 33:59.814
Hey.

34:00.691 --> 34:01.519
Everything all right?

34:01.554 --> 34:04.284
- Yeah.
- Where's your detail?

34:04.403 --> 34:06.181
Um, I snuck out.

34:06.216 --> 34:06.999
All right,
that is crazy.

34:07.034 --> 34:08.683
Their job is to be
with you the whole time,

34:08.717 --> 34:10.232
to look after you
when you get home.

34:10.297 --> 34:12.453
I just needed to see you.

34:13.377 --> 34:15.043
Is everything okay?

34:26.876 --> 34:28.857
I just, um...

34:30.755 --> 34:36.364
I wanted a moment
that was just... us.

34:47.431 --> 34:49.646
Uncle Kurt?

34:50.670 --> 34:53.205
Hey.

34:53.376 --> 34:55.780
Mom said I can help you
with the groceries.

34:55.815 --> 34:57.465
Yeah, you... you can.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.971
They're... they're...
that's yours.

35:00.150 --> 35:01.349
See you tomorrow.

35:01.455 --> 35:02.688
Okay.

35:05.415 --> 35:09.051
Great timing.
Good timing.

35:34.752 --> 35:39.212
Sorry we have to
meet again like this.

35:46.250 --> 35:47.951
Just...

35:48.230 --> 35:53.901
so that there is clarity
in, uh, in this situation,

35:53.936 --> 35:57.887
you are hours away
from being put on a plane

35:57.937 --> 36:01.924
and sent down a dark hole
that only I will know about.

36:02.042 --> 36:05.566
How open you are in our
brief time together

36:05.624 --> 36:09.375
can radically affect how
nice that hole is going to be.

36:09.410 --> 36:13.791
So, if I were you,
I would, um...

36:13.826 --> 36:16.428
well, I'd tell the truth.

36:16.576 --> 36:18.390
Yeah?
Understood?

36:18.425 --> 36:22.573
So, first things first.
Who are you?

36:22.706 --> 36:24.784
I don't know who I am.

36:28.982 --> 36:30.924
Well, have it your way.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.581
Who do you work for?

36:50.853 --> 36:52.806
The FBI.

36:52.841 --> 36:55.843
You know, this could
all be so easy.

36:57.972 --> 36:59.266
It's horrible, right?

36:59.324 --> 37:02.267
The water just burning in
your nose and your lungs.

37:02.302 --> 37:06.256
You want to breathe
but you can't get any air.

37:09.461 --> 37:13.848
So... wh-where did you
get that fancy ink?

37:13.907 --> 37:14.579
I don't know.

37:14.614 --> 37:18.136
See, here's the thing.
I think you do.

37:18.215 --> 37:20.972
Again, who are you?

37:21.007 --> 37:22.397
I don't know!

37:22.442 --> 37:24.199
Well, who sent you
to the FBI?

37:24.281 --> 37:25.895
No one!

37:35.396 --> 37:38.265
The program's
called Orion.

37:40.134 --> 37:42.060
Orion.

37:43.955 --> 37:45.489
What did you say?

37:47.143 --> 37:50.063
Tell me...
what's Orion?

37:50.348 --> 37:53.817
See, that's not
how this works.

37:55.973 --> 37:58.853
You tell <i>me</i> what
you know about Orion.

38:01.368 --> 38:03.318
